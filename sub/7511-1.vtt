00:13.930 --> 00:16.306
In Sixteen Hundred Seven

00:16.474 --> 00:19.101
We sailed the open sea

00:19.269 --> 00:21.437
For glory, God and gold

00:21.604 --> 00:24.648
And the Virginia Company

00:24.816 --> 00:27.401
For the New World is like heaven

00:27.569 --> 00:30.195
And we'll all be rich and free

00:30.363 --> 00:32.448
Or so we have been told

00:32.615 --> 00:35.784
By the Virginia Company

00:35.952 --> 00:37.953
So we have been told

00:38.121 --> 00:41.540
By the Virginia Company

00:51.968 --> 00:53.969
For glory, God, and gold

00:54.137 --> 00:57.222
And the Virginia Company

00:58.266 --> 01:00.059
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Aye!

01:00.226 --> 01:01.769
Hey, look. Is that Smith?

01:01.936 --> 01:04.021
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

01:04.188 --> 01:07.232
Captain John Smith?
I've heard amazing stories about him.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.401
Are you coming on this voyage, too?

01:09.569 --> 01:13.572
Course he is, you half-wit! You can't
fight Indians without John Smith!

01:13.740 --> 01:17.576
That's right. I'm not about
to let you boys have all the fun.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.038
On the beaches of Virginny

01:21.206 --> 01:23.832
There's diamonds like debris

01:24.000 --> 01:26.543
There's silver rivers flowin'

01:26.711 --> 01:29.588
Gold you pick right off a tree

01:29.756 --> 01:31.673
With a nugget for my Winnie

01:31.841 --> 01:34.551
And another one for me

01:34.719 --> 01:36.678
And all the rest'll go

01:36.846 --> 01:40.057
To the Virginia Company

01:40.225 --> 01:42.684
It's glory, God, and gold

01:42.852 --> 01:48.190
And the Virginia Company

01:53.822 --> 01:56.406
Full anchor release!

01:56.574 --> 01:58.075
Come on, lads! Come on!

01:58.243 --> 02:00.077
Give me a hand, someone!

02:00.245 --> 02:01.453
Watch out!

02:05.583 --> 02:07.876
Faster! She's taking on more water!

02:11.756 --> 02:13.590
Look out!

02:17.262 --> 02:19.680
John! Get down here!

02:19.848 --> 02:22.141
The cannons are breaking loose!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.855
- Reef the topsails!
- Aye, sir!

02:28.022 --> 02:29.648
Steady on your course!

02:29.816 --> 02:32.526
It's all right, Thomas!
We'll get her tied off.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.986
Say your prayers, lads!

02:40.201 --> 02:42.911
Look out!

02:43.580 --> 02:44.872
Thomas, watch out...!

02:49.377 --> 02:50.836
Help!

02:51.546 --> 02:53.297
Man overboard!

02:53.464 --> 02:54.464
Help!

02:54.632 --> 02:56.550
Stay your course! He's lost!

02:56.718 --> 02:57.718
Help!

02:57.886 --> 03:00.596
- Pull the pin.
- Aye, sir!

03:04.601 --> 03:08.061
Smith!

03:09.522 --> 03:11.481
Are you crazy?

03:13.109 --> 03:15.611
Hang on, Thomas. I've got you!

03:18.072 --> 03:20.157
Quick... the rope!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.910
Heave!

03:27.749 --> 03:29.791
Come on, lads! Pull!

03:32.420 --> 03:34.379
Pull! Pull!

03:34.547 --> 03:36.131
Put your back into it!

03:36.299 --> 03:39.301
Pull! Pull!

03:39.469 --> 03:41.136
Hang on!

03:43.514 --> 03:45.974
Ah, my lucky lad!

03:46.643 --> 03:49.645
Well, that was refreshing.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.814
- Well done, Smith.
- Of course...

03:52.982 --> 03:54.608
...you'd all do the same for me.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.735
- Yes, yes.
- Sure, sure.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.279
- Of course we would!Absolutely!
- Yeah, we would.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.158
Trouble on deck?

04:03.326 --> 04:06.161
- Governor Ratcliffe!
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.538
Thank heavens he's been
successfully retrieved.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.832
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.170
Don't lose heart, men. It won't be long
before we reach the New World,

04:15.338 --> 04:18.673
and remember what awaits us there...

04:18.841 --> 04:23.929
Freedom, prosperity,
the adventure of our lives.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.515
You're the finest crew
England has to offer,

04:26.683 --> 04:28.934
and nothing, not wind nor rain,

04:29.102 --> 04:32.688
nor a thousand bloodthirsty savages
shall stand in our way.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.564
Carry on, men!

04:36.609 --> 04:38.485
A stirring oration, sir.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.405
I'm sure the men were most exhilarated!

04:41.572 --> 04:47.577
Let us hope so. I'll need those witless
peasants to dig up my gold, won't I?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.040
This New World's
going to be great, John.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.917
I'm going to get a pile of gold,

04:54.085 --> 04:58.505
build me a big house, and if any
Indian tries to stop me, I'll blast him.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.174
Just worry about that fortune
of yours, Thomas.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.344
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us trouble?

05:04.512 --> 05:07.472
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.891
We'll kill ourselves an injun

05:10.059 --> 05:12.728
Or maybe two or three

05:12.895 --> 05:17.941
We're stalwart men and bold
ofthe Virginia Company

05:18.109 --> 05:20.610
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.571
Like all the others, I suppose.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.782
I've seen hundreds
of New Worlds, Thomas.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.160
What could possibly
be different about this one?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.328
It's glory

05:29.662 --> 05:30.829
God, and gold

05:30.997 --> 05:37.002
And the Virginia Company

06:16.918 --> 06:19.127
Steady as the beating drum

06:19.295 --> 06:21.630
Singing to the cedar flute

06:21.798 --> 06:23.882
Seasons go and seasons come

06:24.050 --> 06:28.220
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

06:28.388 --> 06:30.305
By the waters sweet and clean

06:30.473 --> 06:32.724
Where the mighty sturgeon lives

06:32.892 --> 06:35.227
Plant the squash and reap the bean

06:35.395 --> 06:39.314
All the earth our Mother gives

06:39.482 --> 06:41.733
O, Great Spirit, hear our song

06:41.901 --> 06:44.027
Help us keep the ancient ways

06:44.195 --> 06:46.947
Keep the sacred fires strong

06:47.115 --> 06:50.575
Walk in balance all our days

06:50.743 --> 06:52.828
Seasons go and seasons come

06:52.995 --> 06:55.330
Steady as the beating drum

06:55.498 --> 07:01.336
Plum to seed to bud to plum

07:02.255 --> 07:06.758
Steady as the beating drum

07:20.898 --> 07:22.983
It's good to be home.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.529
The Massawomecks are defeated!

07:27.697 --> 07:32.200
With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

07:34.078 --> 07:37.873
Your return has brought
much joy to the village.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.459
Look at all the smiling faces.

07:41.335 --> 07:44.963
Yes. But there's
one smiling face I don't see.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.256
Where is my daughter?

07:46.424 --> 07:48.133
You know Pocahontas.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.177
She has her mother's spirit.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.430
She goes wherever the wind takes her.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.533
Pocahontas!

08:14.785 --> 08:16.411
Your father's back.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.205
Come down here!

08:19.040 --> 08:20.290
He's back, Flit.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.213
Come on, Meeko!

08:33.804 --> 08:36.472
No! Not that... way.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.025
Show-off.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.999
Pocahontas?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.962
Pocahontas? Are you all right?

09:07.755 --> 09:11.091
You'd better be all right,
because I'm not coming in after you...

09:14.971 --> 09:18.473
Don't you think we're getting
a little old for these games?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.495
Help me turn this thing over.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.041
What were you doing up there?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.086
Thinking. Meeko!

09:48.254 --> 09:51.214
About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?

09:51.382 --> 09:54.050
I know it means something,
I just don't know what.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.596
- You should ask your father about it.
- Maybe I should.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.556
Come on, Flit.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.851
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.523
...faced a determined enemy.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.443
The battle lasted
from the rising of the sun

10:11.611 --> 10:13.862
until the evening shadows fell.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.867
Our warriors fought with courage,
but none as bravely as Kocoum,

10:19.035 --> 10:21.870
for he attacked with
the fierce strength of the bear.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.332
- He has proven himself to be...
- He is so handsome!

10:26.208 --> 10:27.709
I especially love the smile.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.753
...destroying every enemy in his path.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.505
Tonight, we will feast in his honour.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.803
- My daughter.
- Winggapo, Father.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.514
Seeing you gives me greatjoy.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.309
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.437
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.148
I want to hear everything
you've been doing.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.698
Father, for many nights now,
I've been having a very strange dream.

10:58.866 --> 11:02.410
It's telling me something's
about to happen, something exciting.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.914
Yes. Something exciting
is about to happen.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.208
Really? What is it?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.920
Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.672
Marry Kocoum?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.968
I told him it would make my heart soar.

11:22.098 --> 11:25.975
But he's so... serious.

11:26.143 --> 11:29.104
My daughter,
Kocoum will make a fine husband.

11:29.271 --> 11:33.066
He is loyal and strong and will build
you a good house with sturdy walls.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.652
With him,
you will be safe from harm.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.613
Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.323
This is the right path for you.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.325
But why can't I choose...

11:50.459 --> 11:53.211
Pocahontas, come with me.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.046
You are the daughter of the chief.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.632
It is time to take
your place among our people.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.387
Even the wild mountain stream
must someday join the big river.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.266
As the river cuts his path

12:07.059 --> 12:10.520
Though the river's proud and strong

12:11.689 --> 12:15.191
He will choose the smoothest course

12:16.569 --> 12:19.696
That's why rivers live so long.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.574
They're steady

12:22.742 --> 12:26.870
As the steady beating drum

12:27.037 --> 12:30.039
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.501
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.756
It suits you.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.887
He wants me to be steady.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.514
Like the river.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.687
But it's not steady at all.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.358
What I love most about rivers is

12:57.526 --> 12:59.444
You can't step in the same river twice

12:59.612 --> 13:01.738
The water's always changing

13:01.906 --> 13:03.615
Always flowing

13:03.783 --> 13:05.533
But people, I guess
can't live like that

13:05.701 --> 13:07.285
We all must pay a price

13:07.453 --> 13:10.955
To be safe we lose our chance
of ever knowing

13:11.123 --> 13:14.876
What's around the river bend

13:15.044 --> 13:17.754
Waiting just around the river bend

13:17.922 --> 13:20.381
I look once more

13:20.549 --> 13:22.300
Just around the river bend

13:22.468 --> 13:24.052
Beyond the shore

13:24.220 --> 13:25.762
Where the gulls fly free

13:25.930 --> 13:27.889
Don't know what for

13:28.057 --> 13:30.099
What I dream the day might send

13:30.267 --> 13:33.353
Just around the river bend

13:33.521 --> 13:36.606
For me

13:36.774 --> 13:41.194
Coming for me

13:41.362 --> 13:45.990
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls

13:46.158 --> 13:49.494
Can I ignore that sound
of distant drumming?

13:49.662 --> 13:53.414
For a handsome, sturdy husband
who builds handsome, sturdy walls

13:53.582 --> 13:57.418
And never dreams that
something might be coming

13:57.586 --> 14:04.926
Just around the river bend

14:05.094 --> 14:07.011
I look once more

14:07.179 --> 14:08.680
Just around the river bend

14:08.848 --> 14:10.598
Beyond the shore

14:10.766 --> 14:12.350
Somewhere past the sea

14:12.518 --> 14:14.435
Don't know what for

14:14.603 --> 14:16.396
Why do all my dreams extend

14:16.564 --> 14:20.275
Just around the river bend?

14:20.442 --> 14:23.778
Just around the river bend

14:26.240 --> 14:29.576
Should I choose the smoothest course

14:29.743 --> 14:33.496
Steady as the beating drum?

14:34.290 --> 14:37.625
Should I marry Kocoum?

14:38.544 --> 14:42.547
Is all my dreaming at an end?

14:44.758 --> 14:48.469
Or do you still

14:48.637 --> 14:53.892
Wait for me, dream giver?

14:54.059 --> 14:59.939
Just around the river

15:01.275 --> 15:05.445
Bend

15:31.388 --> 15:33.556
Is that my Pocahontas?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.685
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.148
Good morning, child.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.817
I was hoping you'd visit today.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.112
Why, your mother's necklace!

15:48.280 --> 15:50.823
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.076
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.663
Kocoum? But he's so serious!

15:56.830 --> 16:00.541
I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me.

16:00.709 --> 16:03.670
But lately, I've been having
this dream, and I think it's...

16:03.837 --> 16:08.216
Oh, a dream! Let's hear all about it!

16:09.843 --> 16:14.097
Quiet!

16:20.020 --> 16:22.063
Now, child, you were saying?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.732
Well, I'm running through the woods,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.527
and then right there
in front of me is an arrow.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.071
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.825
A spinning arrow? How unusual!

16:33.993 --> 16:39.372
Yes, it spins faster and faster
and faster... until, suddenly, it stops.

16:43.377 --> 16:48.589
Well, it seems to me this spinning arrow
is pointing you down your path.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.884
But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.720
How am I ever going to find it?

16:54.930 --> 16:58.433
Your mother asked me
the very same question.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.852
She did? What did you tell her?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.855
I told her to listen.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.858
All around you are spirits, child.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.945
They live in the earth,
the water, the sky.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.034
If you listen, they will guide you.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.664
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.083
What is it telling you?

17:24.251 --> 17:26.335
I don't understand.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.426
You will understand

17:33.594 --> 17:36.971
Listen with your heart

17:37.139 --> 17:40.558
You will understand

17:41.143 --> 17:47.148
Let it break upon you
like a wave upon the sand

17:47.316 --> 17:49.150
It's saying something's coming.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.902
Strange clouds?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.280
Listen with your heart

17:54.448 --> 17:58.367
You will understand

18:05.167 --> 18:06.667
What do you see?

18:07.503 --> 18:11.380
Clouds. Strange clouds.

18:14.510 --> 18:20.181
Look at it, Wiggins, an entire
New World chock-full of gold,

18:20.349 --> 18:22.350
just waiting for me.

18:22.518 --> 18:26.646
And scores of adventures
waiting for us, right, Percy?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.606
Do you think we'll meet some savages?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.692
Ifwe do, we shall be sure
to give them a proper English greeting.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.653
Gift baskets!

18:35.197 --> 18:37.365
And he came so highly recommended.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.704
It's perfect, the water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.373
Hey, there, Percy.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.377
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.546
I've got a crew assembled,
and they're ready to go.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.422
About the natives...

18:53.590 --> 18:56.008
I'm counting on you to make sure
those filthy heathens

18:56.176 --> 18:57.677
don't disrupt our mission.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.638
Well, if they're anything like
the savages I've fought before,

19:00.806 --> 19:02.140
it's nothing I can't handle.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.309
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.228
See ya, Percy.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.941
The men like Smith, don't they?

19:13.986 --> 19:18.239
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.

19:18.407 --> 19:22.243
Don't think I don't know what those
backstabbers at court say about me.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.871
Oh, yes, all that talk
about being a pathetic social climber

19:25.038 --> 19:27.540
- who's failed at everything...
- I'm very well aware that this is

19:27.708 --> 19:31.085
my last chance for glory.
But mark my words, Wiggins,

19:31.253 --> 19:33.921
when King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth,

19:34.089 --> 19:37.758
success will be mine, at last.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.888
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Two of you up on the yardarm!

19:42.055 --> 19:43.556
It's incredible.

19:43.724 --> 19:47.059
And it's all ours.
I've never seen anything like it.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.353
It can look like
Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care,

19:49.521 --> 19:52.315
just as long as I
get off this stinking boat!

19:52.482 --> 19:55.443
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

20:50.582 --> 20:54.877
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut! Steady! Steady!

20:55.045 --> 20:56.754
Hold up! That's far enough!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.257
All right now... tie her off!

20:59.424 --> 21:01.092
Here, John, tie off this end.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.803
John? John?

21:05.013 --> 21:07.974
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.583
Hey!

21:39.840 --> 21:43.801
Well... you're a strange looking fellow.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.469
You hungry?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.888
Here you go. It's a biscuit.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.683
It's food. Well, sort of.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.395
You like it, eh?

21:54.563 --> 21:57.356
Well, try eating it
for four months straight.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.904
You got a friend back there?

22:13.999 --> 22:17.043
Hey... what the... What...? Watch out.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.590
- No... get that... Look out!
- John, you better get down here!

22:22.758 --> 22:26.594
- The governor's coming ashore.
- All right. I'm leaving.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.737
Did you see their skin?

22:44.905 --> 22:45.905
Pale and sickly.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.448
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

22:47.616 --> 22:51.786
My brothers, we must know
more about these visitors.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.955
Kekata, what do you see?

23:11.473 --> 23:13.808
These are not men like us...

23:14.684 --> 23:19.563
...but strange beasts
with bodies that shine like the sun,

23:19.731 --> 23:23.859
and weapons that spout fire
and thunder.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.492
They prowl the earth
like ravenous wolves,

23:31.660 --> 23:34.912
consuming everything in their path.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.295
Great Powhatan, I will lead our warriors
to the river and attack.

23:43.463 --> 23:47.341
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.845
Kocoum, in that battle we knew
how to fight our enemy,

23:51.012 --> 23:53.431
but these pale visitors
are strange to us.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.975
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.686
Let us hope
they do not intend to stay.

24:00.021 --> 24:03.649
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches

24:03.817 --> 24:06.110
in the name of His Majesty,
King James the First,

24:06.278 --> 24:10.614
and do so name
this settlement Jamestown.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.743
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir!

24:14.911 --> 24:16.203
Hurry now, Percy.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.789
We must be all squeaky clean
for the New World.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.836
Captain Smith, it appears
I've selected the perfect location.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.213
Not a savage in sight.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.090
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there.

25:10.926 --> 25:15.721
Then perhaps you should venture forth
and determine their whereabouts.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.891
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.646
Now, gentlemen, to work.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.524
You men, get the ship unloaded,
you men build the fort.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.443
The rest of you...
break out the shovels!

25:29.736 --> 25:32.488
- It's time to start digging!
- Digging?

25:32.656 --> 25:35.741
Well, of course! Let's not forget
what the Spanish found

25:36.034 --> 25:38.035
when they came to the New World.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.080
Gold! Mountains of it.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.792
Why, for years, they've been
ravaging the New World

25:44.960 --> 25:46.794
of its most precious resources.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.796
But now...

25:50.757 --> 25:52.675
...it's our turn.

25:53.426 --> 25:57.304
The gold of CortÃ©z
the jewels of Pizarro

25:57.472 --> 26:01.475
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

26:01.643 --> 26:05.229
The gold we find here
will dwarfthem by far

26:05.397 --> 26:08.399
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys

26:08.567 --> 26:12.361
Dig up Virginia, boys

26:12.529 --> 26:14.113
Mine, boys

26:14.281 --> 26:15.614
Mine every mountain

26:15.782 --> 26:17.241
And dig, boys

26:17.409 --> 26:18.951
Dig till ya drop

26:19.119 --> 26:20.869
Grab a pick, boys

26:21.037 --> 26:22.663
Quick, boys

26:22.831 --> 26:23.998
Shove in a shovel

26:24.165 --> 26:28.544
Uncover those lovely pebbles
that sparkle and shine

26:28.712 --> 26:31.130
It's gold

26:31.298 --> 26:35.551
And it's mine, mine, mine

26:35.719 --> 26:37.928
Dig and diggety dig

26:38.096 --> 26:40.514
And dig and dig and diggety dig

26:40.682 --> 26:43.684
- Hey, nonny, nonny hi, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it

26:43.852 --> 26:46.812
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap

26:46.980 --> 26:50.024
- Hey, nonny, nonny, hi, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it

26:50.191 --> 26:54.903
- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, diggety, dig!

26:55.071 --> 26:58.198
My rivals back home
it's not that I'm bitter

26:58.366 --> 27:01.785
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter

27:01.953 --> 27:05.456
The ladies at court
will be all a-twitter

27:05.624 --> 27:07.124
The king will reward me

27:07.292 --> 27:10.753
He'll knight me
No! Lord me

27:10.920 --> 27:14.840
It's mine!
Mine, mine for the taking

27:15.008 --> 27:17.676
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

27:17.844 --> 27:22.681
With those nuggets dug
it's glory they'll give me

27:22.849 --> 27:27.269
My dear friend, King Jimmy
will probably build me a shrine

27:27.437 --> 27:30.939
When all ofthe gold

27:31.107 --> 27:32.441
Is mine

27:32.609 --> 27:38.030
And dig and dig and diggety dig

27:38.198 --> 27:43.285
All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one

27:44.454 --> 27:50.417
A wild or more challenging country
I couldn't design

27:51.252 --> 27:56.924
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't plan to miss one

27:57.759 --> 28:01.053
In a land I can claim, a land I can tame

28:01.221 --> 28:04.515
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

28:04.683 --> 28:06.433
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads

28:06.601 --> 28:09.478
Mine, boys, mine

28:09.646 --> 28:14.858
Mine me that gold

28:15.026 --> 28:17.611
- Beautiful gold
- Dig for that gold

28:17.779 --> 28:21.573
Make this island my land

28:21.741 --> 28:24.827
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys

28:24.994 --> 28:27.037
But I've got this crick in me spine

28:27.205 --> 28:30.541
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

28:30.709 --> 28:35.045
- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold

28:35.213 --> 28:36.964
So go for the gold

28:37.132 --> 28:38.549
We know which is here

28:38.717 --> 28:44.638
Mine, mine, mine

31:32.682 --> 31:35.267
No! Wait! Please...

31:43.610 --> 31:45.110
Please!

31:47.363 --> 31:49.197
Don't run off.

31:52.201 --> 31:55.078
It's all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.707
Here. Let me help you out of there.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.546
You don't understand a word
I'm saying, do you?

32:09.802 --> 32:11.303
It's all right.

32:28.738 --> 32:32.324
Listen with your heart

32:32.492 --> 32:35.911
You will understand

32:43.252 --> 32:45.921
Let it break upon you

32:46.089 --> 32:50.509
Like a wave upon the sand

32:51.803 --> 32:53.220
Who are you?

32:53.388 --> 32:57.015
Listen with your heart

32:57.183 --> 33:02.062
You will understand

33:02.230 --> 33:04.481
Pocahontas.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.067
What? What did you say?

33:07.235 --> 33:10.696
My name is Pocahontas.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.535
I'm John Smith.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.709
That's it. Keep at it, men.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.712
Keep digging.
It's got to be here somewhere.

33:28.715 --> 33:32.175
- There's 30 more down by the ridge.
- That makes more than 100!

33:32.510 --> 33:35.887
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

33:36.055 --> 33:39.808
How long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.436
We're slaving away,
busting our backs day and night...

33:42.603 --> 33:45.063
For king and country. I know, I know.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.233
And I share your fatigue. Wiggins!

33:48.818 --> 33:50.068
Wiggins!

33:51.529 --> 33:54.448
- Coming!
- Dispose of this.

33:56.034 --> 34:00.454
Who's a good doggie?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.831
Fetch, boy!

34:07.462 --> 34:09.420
Savages! It's an ambush!Arm yourselves!

34:09.589 --> 34:11.255
Run!

34:11.424 --> 34:12.591
Arm yourselves!

34:14.427 --> 34:17.054
Make sure every man has a musket!

34:17.804 --> 34:18.847
Shoot!

34:21.684 --> 34:23.976
Them, you idiot!

34:34.864 --> 34:37.616
Where's that blasted Smith
when I need him?

34:44.498 --> 34:45.581
Namontack!

34:57.011 --> 34:58.470
Back to the village!

35:01.182 --> 35:05.685
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.522
Everyone back to camp.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.149
Get the rest of the cannons ashore,
finish building the fort!

35:11.317 --> 35:12.609
Aye, Governor!

35:13.611 --> 35:18.115
And you... learn to use
that thing properly.

35:18.282 --> 35:22.244
A man's not a man
unless he knows how to shoot.

35:30.169 --> 35:34.548
These beasts invade our shores,
and now this.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.845
This wound is strange to me.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.726
We will fight this enemy,
but we cannot do it alone.

35:46.894 --> 35:50.063
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.941
We will call on our brothers
to help us fight.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.902
These white men are dangerous!

35:56.070 --> 35:58.697
No one is to go near them.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.119
It's called a helmet.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.829
Helmet.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.542
So... what river is this?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.294
Quiyoughcohannock.

36:12.461 --> 36:15.213
You have the most unusual names here.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.967
Chickahominy.
Quiyo... Quiyoughcohannock.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.137
Pocahontas.

36:22.305 --> 36:25.724
You have the most unusual name, too.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.267
John Smith.

36:28.394 --> 36:32.898
Hey! Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?

36:33.065 --> 36:36.651
- Meeko!
- Well, how do you do, Meeko?

36:39.906 --> 36:42.407
It's all right. It's just a handshake.

36:43.075 --> 36:44.868
Here, let me show you.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.038
Nothing's happening.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.041
No, no. I need your hand first.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.089
It's how we say hello.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.597
This is how we say hello. Winggapo.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.061
Winggapo.

37:11.687 --> 37:15.565
And how we say goodbye. Anah.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.443
I like hello better.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.617
Yeah, I remember you.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.872
- Flitjust doesn't like strangers.
- But I'm not a stranger any more.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.291
Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

37:33.751 --> 37:37.254
- Very stubborn.
- Hey!

37:38.297 --> 37:42.259
- Meeko! Come back here.
- Don't worry. He can't hurt it.

37:42.426 --> 37:45.512
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Meeko, bring that back.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.889
No, it's all right. He can keep it.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.849
Call it a gift.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.311
What was that?

37:53.479 --> 37:55.230
- My compass.
- Compass?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.357
It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.651
It's all right.
I'll get another in London.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.528
London? Is that your village?

38:01.696 --> 38:04.698
- Yes. It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

38:04.865 --> 38:08.034
It's got streets filled with carriages,

38:08.202 --> 38:12.038
bridges over the rivers,
and buildings as tall as trees.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.291
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.042
- How?
- We're going to build them here.

38:16.210 --> 38:19.296
We'll show your people
how to use this land properly.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.840
- How to make the most of it.
- Make the most of it?

38:22.008 --> 38:25.010
Yes. We'll build roads
and decent houses...

38:25.177 --> 38:27.053
Our houses are fine.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.973
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.518
Wait a minute. Don't take it that...

38:33.686 --> 38:36.396
Hey! Wait!

38:37.064 --> 38:40.483
Wait! There's so much we can teach you.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.569
We've improved the lives
of savages all over the world.

38:42.737 --> 38:43.903
Savages?

38:44.530 --> 38:46.072
Not that you're a savage.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.782
- Just my people.
- No.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.827
Listen, that's not what I meant.
Let me explain.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.205
- Let go!
- No. I'm not letting you leave.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.542
Look, don't do this.

38:57.710 --> 39:01.171
Savage is just a word, you know?

39:01.339 --> 39:04.966
A term for...
people who are uncivilised.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.134
Like me.

39:06.302 --> 39:10.138
Well, when I say uncivilised,
what I mean is...

39:20.024 --> 39:23.360
What you mean is... not like you.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.654
You think I'm an ignorant savage

39:26.822 --> 39:29.157
And you've been so many places

39:29.325 --> 39:31.576
I guess it must be so

39:31.744 --> 39:34.245
But still, I cannot see

39:34.413 --> 39:37.624
Ifthe savage one is me

39:37.792 --> 39:43.588
How can there be so much
that you don't know

39:44.215 --> 39:48.718
You don't know

39:56.769 --> 40:01.648
You think you own
whatever land you land on

40:01.816 --> 40:06.194
The earth isjust
a dead thing you can claim

40:06.362 --> 40:10.698
But I know every rock
and tree and creature

40:10.866 --> 40:15.370
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

40:15.538 --> 40:19.958
You think the only people
who are people

40:20.126 --> 40:24.212
Are the people
who look and think like you

40:24.380 --> 40:28.466
But if you walk
the footsteps of a stranger

40:28.634 --> 40:33.304
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

40:33.472 --> 40:38.309
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon?

40:38.477 --> 40:42.439
Or ask the grinning bobcat
why he grinned?

40:42.606 --> 40:47.318
Can you sing with all the voices
ofthe mountain?

40:47.486 --> 40:51.990
Can you paint with all the colours
ofthe wind?

40:52.158 --> 40:55.743
Can you paint with all the colours

40:55.911 --> 40:59.497
Ofthe wind?

41:06.505 --> 41:10.341
Come run the hidden pine trails
ofthe forest

41:10.509 --> 41:14.596
Come taste the sun-sweet berries
ofthe earth

41:14.763 --> 41:18.558
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

41:18.726 --> 41:23.104
And for once, never wonder
what they're worth

41:23.272 --> 41:27.317
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

41:27.485 --> 41:31.988
The heron and the otter are my friends

41:32.156 --> 41:35.992
And we are all connected to each other

41:36.160 --> 41:40.997
In a circle, in a hoop, that never ends

41:41.165 --> 41:45.376
How high does the sycamore grow?

41:45.544 --> 41:51.341
If you cut it down
then you'll never know

41:51.800 --> 41:57.722
And you'll never hear the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon

41:57.890 --> 42:01.809
For whether we are white
or copper-skinned

42:01.977 --> 42:06.564
We need to sing with all the voices
ofthe mountain

42:06.732 --> 42:11.569
We need to paint
with all the colours ofthe wind

42:11.737 --> 42:14.531
You can own the earth, and still

42:14.698 --> 42:18.243
All you'll own is earth until

42:18.410 --> 42:20.703
You can paint

42:20.871 --> 42:23.831
With all the colours

42:23.999 --> 42:27.752
Ofthe

42:27.920 --> 42:33.925
Wind

42:48.732 --> 42:50.358
What is it?

42:50.526 --> 42:53.945
The drums. They mean trouble.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.739
I shouldn't be here.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.700
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.868
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.165
I have to go.

43:16.468 --> 43:18.720
All right! This one's ready to hoist!

43:18.887 --> 43:21.306
Two on each side. Ready now? Push!

43:21.473 --> 43:23.099
Watch it! It's slipping.

43:23.267 --> 43:26.227
Come on, lads,
it's only a little picket fence.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.563
- Steady! Steady!
- There you go.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.149
That'll keep everything out, eh, John?

43:33.319 --> 43:35.653
- Something wrong, John?
- What?

43:35.821 --> 43:40.742
- You've been quiet the last few days.
- He's mad he missed all the action.

43:40.909 --> 43:43.578
Don't worry, John. You'll get
your chance to deal with the Indians.

43:43.746 --> 43:47.332
Yeah. We'll take care of them,
like we did last time, eh, mates?

43:47.499 --> 43:49.959
We shot ourselves an injun

43:50.127 --> 43:51.878
Or maybe two or three

43:52.046 --> 43:54.505
All right, you howling nutter,
get to work.

43:54.673 --> 43:57.383
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

43:57.551 --> 44:00.178
Sure! We're having loads of fun, right?

44:00.346 --> 44:02.180
Look at us. No gold, no food,

44:02.348 --> 44:06.726
while Ratcliffe sits up in his tent
all day, happy as a clam.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.187
I'm doomed!

44:09.355 --> 44:13.274
I should be wallowing in riches by now,
and I haven't found as much as a speck.

44:13.442 --> 44:18.237
Think. Think!
It's got to be around here somewhere.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.199
Where could it be?

44:22.701 --> 44:28.206
I've mined the forests and the hills
and the swamps... and nothing!

44:31.043 --> 44:34.295
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

44:35.881 --> 44:39.676
I... I...
I made it myself!

44:39.968 --> 44:41.678
Take that silly...

44:42.554 --> 44:44.764
Of course. The Indians.

44:44.932 --> 44:48.351
Wiggins, why do you think
those insolent heathens attacked us?

44:48.519 --> 44:51.771
We invaded their land, cut down
their trees and dug up their earth?

44:51.939 --> 44:56.526
It's the gold! They have it, and
they don't want us to take it from them.

44:56.694 --> 45:00.238
Well, I'll just have to
take it by force then, won't I?

45:02.241 --> 45:05.076
You there! Where's Captain Smith?

45:05.244 --> 45:09.747
- Well, he's... gone.
- Aye. Your singing scared him off.

45:09.915 --> 45:13.292
- Go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What ifwe run into the Indians?

45:13.460 --> 45:16.254
That's what guns are for.

45:16.422 --> 45:18.423
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

45:43.949 --> 45:45.825
Pocahontas.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.828
You should be inside the village.

45:48.996 --> 45:50.329
We'll be all right.

45:50.497 --> 45:53.666
We're gathering food
for when the warriors arrive.

45:53.834 --> 45:54.876
Don't go far.

45:55.043 --> 45:58.379
- Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.

45:59.882 --> 46:04.093
When I see you wear that necklace,
you lookjust like your mother.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.596
I miss her.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.890
But she is still with us.

46:09.057 --> 46:13.311
Whenever the wind moves through
the trees, I feel her presence.

46:13.479 --> 46:16.189
Our people look to her
for wisdom and strength.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.983
Someday, they will look to you as well.

46:19.151 --> 46:20.777
I would be honoured by that.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.696
You shouldn't be out here alone.

46:23.864 --> 46:27.241
- I'll send for Kocoum.
- All right, what is it?

46:27.409 --> 46:28.868
- What?
- You're hiding something.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.870
I'm not hiding anything.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.039
Pocahontas, you can tell me. I promise.

46:33.207 --> 46:37.210
I won't tell anyone... Pocahontas, look!

46:40.672 --> 46:44.217
- It's one of them! I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?

46:44.384 --> 46:46.260
I had to see you again.

46:46.428 --> 46:51.390
- Pocahontas! Pocahontas!
- Please! Don't say anything.

46:51.558 --> 46:52.892
Quick! This way!

46:53.060 --> 46:54.644
- But...
- Nakoma.

46:54.812 --> 46:59.106
- Where is Pocahontas?
- I haven't seen her.

47:00.400 --> 47:04.237
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

47:04.404 --> 47:07.490
Tell her that. She listens to you.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.744
Sure she does.

47:27.886 --> 47:29.929
This place is incredible.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.224
And to think we came all this way
just to dig it up for gold.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.142
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.105
- What's gold?
- You know, it's yellow.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.315
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.276
Here, we have lots of it.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.611
Gold.

47:45.779 --> 47:49.949
No, no! Gold is this.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.118
There's nothing like that around here.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.954
- No gold?
- Not that I've seen.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.623
All this way for nothing.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.459
Those boys are in for a big surprise.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.879
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.424
Will you go home?

48:06.592 --> 48:09.886
Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to.

48:10.053 --> 48:12.305
I've never really belonged anywhere.

48:12.639 --> 48:14.807
You could belong here.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.401
What was that?

48:25.569 --> 48:29.780
- Did you see something?
- No, no. I just...

48:29.948 --> 48:32.867
I didn't see anything. Did I?

48:33.035 --> 48:34.702
Look again.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.706
Let it break upon you

48:38.874 --> 48:43.544
Like a wave upon the sand

48:45.088 --> 48:47.298
Hello, John Smith.

48:47.466 --> 48:50.301
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.428
Then you should talk back.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.472
Don't be frightened, young man.

48:54.640 --> 48:57.183
My bark is worse than my bite.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.271
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

49:02.439 --> 49:04.857
Anything you want.

49:08.028 --> 49:12.114
- So...
- Come closer, John Smith.

49:13.367 --> 49:17.620
He has a good soul.
And he's handsome, too!

49:17.788 --> 49:20.957
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

49:21.124 --> 49:24.543
Smith! Smith, where are you, mate?

49:24.711 --> 49:27.213
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

49:27.381 --> 49:31.092
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

49:31.259 --> 49:35.471
If you spot one, don't ask questions.
Just shoot.

49:37.557 --> 49:41.185
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me! It was the tree.

49:41.353 --> 49:44.855
Of course! The tree just felt
like lifting its roots...

49:48.110 --> 49:49.652
Let's get out of here.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.156
- Run!
- But what about Smith?

49:54.324 --> 49:57.076
He's a big lad,
he can take care of himself!

49:57.244 --> 49:58.411
I'm glad you're on our side.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.539
There's still some snap
in these old vines.

50:01.707 --> 50:04.375
I better get back before
they send the whole camp after me.

50:04.543 --> 50:08.337
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight, right here.

50:13.552 --> 50:18.222
Well! I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

50:18.390 --> 50:21.434
What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.436
I mean, I want to see him again.

50:23.603 --> 50:26.564
Who wouldn't? I want to see him again.

50:26.732 --> 50:30.568
But, still, something inside
is telling me it's the right thing.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.278
Perhaps it's your dream.

50:32.446 --> 50:37.533
My dream? Do you think he's the one
the spinning arrow was pointing to?

50:46.626 --> 50:48.377
The warriors are here.

51:00.057 --> 51:02.767
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

51:02.934 --> 51:04.226
- There you are!
- Kocoum!

51:04.394 --> 51:08.481
Look at them! Now we have enough
warriors to destroy those white demons!

51:10.484 --> 51:14.779
Now that we are joined by our brothers,
we will defeat this enemy.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.080
Father, I need to speak with you.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.832
Not now, my daughter.
The council is gathering.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.336
We don't have to fight them.
There must be a better way.

51:30.504 --> 51:33.130
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.841
But maybe we should try talking to them.

51:36.009 --> 51:37.426
They do not want to talk.

51:37.594 --> 51:41.263
But if one of them did want to talk,
you would listen to him, wouldn't you?

51:41.431 --> 51:43.349
- Pocahontas...
- Wouldn't you?

51:43.517 --> 51:47.686
Of course I would,
but it is not that simple.

51:47.854 --> 51:50.356
Nothing is simple any more.

52:34.609 --> 52:36.527
Easy, Thomas, it's me.

52:37.529 --> 52:42.032
- Oh, John! I could've killed you.
- Not aiming like that, you couldn't.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.244
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.
You'll see twice as well.

52:46.913 --> 52:50.124
- Smith! There you are.
- We were looking all over for you.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.419
Smith! Where have you been?

52:53.587 --> 52:56.130
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

52:56.298 --> 52:58.674
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.759
We'll need that information
for the battle.

53:00.927 --> 53:03.179
- What battle?
- We will eliminate these savages

53:03.346 --> 53:06.140
- once and for all.
- No! You can't do that!

53:07.184 --> 53:11.687
- Oh, can't I?
- Look. We don't have to fight them.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.731
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

53:13.899 --> 53:16.108
- You what?
- A savage?

53:16.276 --> 53:18.944
They're not savages. They can help us.

53:19.112 --> 53:22.531
They know the land. They know
how to navigate the rivers.

53:23.116 --> 53:25.659
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

53:25.827 --> 53:27.953
It's better than hardtack and gruel,
that's for sure.

53:28.121 --> 53:29.121
I like gruel.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.832
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

53:32.000 --> 53:34.293
They want to kill us!All of us!

53:34.461 --> 53:37.421
They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything to keep it!

53:37.589 --> 53:41.091
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

53:41.801 --> 53:45.304
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

53:45.472 --> 53:46.805
Yes.

53:46.973 --> 53:50.559
Lies. Lies!All of it!
Murderous thieves.

53:50.727 --> 53:52.770
There's no room for their kind
in civilised society.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.230
But this is their land!

53:54.397 --> 53:57.650
This is my land!
I make the laws here.

53:57.817 --> 54:01.987
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian

54:02.155 --> 54:07.493
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason and hanged.

54:12.457 --> 54:13.832
Pocahontas!

54:14.000 --> 54:15.668
- Nakoma.
- Don't go out there.

54:15.835 --> 54:19.088
I lied for you once,
don't ask me to do it again.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.673
I have to do this.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.883
- He's one of them!
- You don't know him.

54:23.051 --> 54:25.844
If you go out there, you'll be turning
your back on your own people.

54:26.012 --> 54:28.305
I'm trying to help my people.

54:28.473 --> 54:31.600
Pocahontas, please,
you're my best friend.

54:31.768 --> 54:33.394
I don't want you to get hurt.

54:33.561 --> 54:37.439
- I won't. I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!

54:44.072 --> 54:46.865
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothing.

54:47.033 --> 54:50.327
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

54:50.495 --> 54:53.622
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been
lying to us since we left London.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.624
Listen to you, you bunch of idiots.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.127
Those savages didn't
attack us for nothing.

54:58.295 --> 54:59.878
They're hiding something.

55:00.046 --> 55:03.382
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight them.

55:03.550 --> 55:06.051
- Not me. I'm not risking my neck...
- Either too hot or too cold.

55:06.219 --> 55:08.721
I haven't been comfortable
since we got here.

55:09.889 --> 55:12.391
Me, too. I'm itching a lot.

55:19.441 --> 55:21.859
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.320
I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.

55:24.487 --> 55:27.489
- Yes, sir.
- If you happen to see any Indians...

55:28.491 --> 55:29.992
...shoot them.

55:33.663 --> 55:36.373
And, Thomas,
you've been a slipshod sailor

55:36.541 --> 55:38.917
and a poor excuse for a soldier.

55:39.085 --> 55:41.378
Don't disappoint me again.

55:51.806 --> 55:53.640
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

55:54.601 --> 55:58.354
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

56:00.398 --> 56:02.316
I think she's in trouble.

56:06.988 --> 56:09.948
The earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

56:10.116 --> 56:11.450
The warriors are here.

56:11.618 --> 56:13.577
- Pocahontas.
- John!

56:14.788 --> 56:18.540
Listen to me. My men are planning
to attack your people.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.708
You've got to warn them.

56:19.876 --> 56:22.002
Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

56:22.170 --> 56:24.213
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.924
Pocahontas, talking
isn't going to do any good.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.759
I already tried talking to my men,

56:28.927 --> 56:31.220
but everything
about this land has them spooked.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.018
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen!

56:42.232 --> 56:43.816
Percy?

56:46.236 --> 56:48.904
- Easy, Percy! Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

56:49.072 --> 56:51.740
You see what I mean? Once two sides
want to fight, nothing can stop them.

56:51.908 --> 56:55.077
- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right. He's a friend.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.412
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

56:58.790 --> 57:01.375
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

57:01.543 --> 57:05.546
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

57:12.470 --> 57:14.972
It's enough to make your sap boil.

57:16.474 --> 57:20.727
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look!

57:24.816 --> 57:28.026
- The ripples.
- What about them?

57:28.194 --> 57:32.739
So small at first,
then look how they grow.

57:34.033 --> 57:36.785
But someone has to start them.

57:37.412 --> 57:38.954
They're not going to listen to us.

57:39.122 --> 57:43.333
Young man, sometimes the right path
is not the easiest one.

57:43.501 --> 57:45.169
Don't you see?

57:45.336 --> 57:49.631
Only when the fighting stops
can you be together.

57:53.636 --> 57:56.263
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

58:32.592 --> 58:34.760
Kocoum, no!

58:41.392 --> 58:42.976
Kocoum!

58:46.105 --> 58:47.356
Leave him alone!

59:03.790 --> 59:05.874
Kocoum, stop!

59:08.253 --> 59:10.337
Both eyes open.

59:18.638 --> 59:21.306
- Thomas!
- Is he...

59:21.474 --> 59:23.225
You killed him.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.227
- I thought that...
- Get away from him!

59:25.395 --> 59:27.479
Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...

59:27.647 --> 59:28.647
He killed him!

59:30.149 --> 59:31.984
Get all the wagons...

59:32.151 --> 59:35.737
Thomas, get out of here!
Get out of here!

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.844
Who did this?

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.971
Pocahontas was out in the woods.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:46.058
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked them.

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:52.898
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.485
- At sunrise, he'll be the first to die!
- But Father!

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:00.030
I told you to stay in the village.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.032
You disobeyed me.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.827
- You have shamed your father!
- I was only trying to help.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:09.915
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.875
Take him away!

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:28.642
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:32.729
Pocahontas...
I sent Kocoum after you.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.733
I was worried about you.

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:39.027
I thought I was doing the right thing.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:42.030
All this happened because of me.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.283
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:49.079
Come with me.

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:57.713
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes
of the man who killed Kocoum.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.134
Be quick.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.154
Pocahontas.

01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:28.118
- I'm so sorry.
- For what? This?

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.620
I've gotten out of
worse scrapes than this.

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:32.247
Can't think of any right now, but...

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.249
It would've been better
ifwe'd never met.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:38.712
- None of this would've happened.
- Pocahontas, look at me.

01:02:39.797 --> 01:02:44.551
I'd rather die tomorrow than live
a hundred years without knowing you.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.638
- Pocahontas.
- I can't leave you.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.182
You never will.

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:55.061
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:11.453
Help! Somebody help! Help!

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.205
- Help!
- Easy, lad. What is it?

01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:14.873
It's Smith! They got him!

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:17.209
- Who got him?
- The savages!

01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:19.085
- Savages?
- They captured him! Dragged him off!

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.879
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.089
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:25.383
Filthy beasts!

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:29.346
It's perfect, Wiggins! I couldn't
have planned this better myself.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:32.390
The gold is as good as mine.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:35.227
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us.

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:37.729
Thomas is right!
We've got to do something.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:42.567
And so we shall. I told you
those savages couldn't be trusted.

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:45.946
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

01:03:46.405 --> 01:03:49.908
But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.285
At daybreak, we attack!

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:57.123
What can you expect
from filthy little heathens?

01:03:57.291 --> 01:04:00.377
Here's what you get
when races are diverse

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.212
Their skin's a hellish red

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.839
They're only good when dead

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.424
They're vermin as I said and worse

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:09.344
They're savages, savages

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.514
- Barely even human
- Savages, savages

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.266
Drive them from our shore!

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:15.934
They're not like you and me

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.727
Which means they must be evil

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.605
We must sound the drums ofwar

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.732
They're savages, savages

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.609
Dirty, shrieking devils

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:28.572
Now we sound the drums ofwar

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:34.870
This is what we feared

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.746
The paleface is a demon

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:39.791
The only thing they feel at all is greed

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:41.626
Beneath that milky hide

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:43.336
There's emptiness inside

01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:46.298
I wonder ifthey even bleed

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:48.633
They're savages, savages

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.302
Barely even human

01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:52.053
Savages, savages

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.388
Killers at the core

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.223
They're different from us

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:57.309
Which means they can't be trusted

01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:00.270
We must sound the drums ofwar

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.314
They're savages, savages

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.065
First we deal with this one

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.817
Then we sound the drums ofwar

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.319
Savages, savages

01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:09.154
Let's go get a few, men!

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.906
Savages, savages

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.657
Now it's up to you, men!

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:14.409
- Savages
- Savages

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.161
Barely even human

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.664
Now we sound the drums

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:24.878
Ofwar

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.387
They're going to kill him at sunrise,
Grandmother Willow.

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:36.014
You have to stop them.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:39.684
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:43.563
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.899
I feel so lost.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.126
The compass.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.345
The spinning arrow.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.681
It's the arrow from your dream!

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:21.017
I was right. It was pointing to him!

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:30.402
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child!

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:34.239
Let the spirits of the earth guide you!

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:40.161
You know your path, child.
Now follow it!

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.250
This will be the day

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.585
Let's go, men!

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.922
This will be the morning

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.924
Bring out the prisoner!

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.385
We will see them dying in the dust

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:56.761
I don't know what I can do

01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.680
Still I know I've got to try

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.390
Now we make them pay

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.058
Eagle, help my feet to fly

01:07:02.226 --> 01:07:03.601
Now, without a warning

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:05.520
Mountain, help my heart be great

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.063
Now we leave them
blood and bone and rust

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:10.942
- Spirits ofthe earth and sky
- It's them or us

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.570
Please don't let it be too late

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:16.031
They're a bunch of
filthy, stinking savages

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.365
- Savages
- Demons

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:18.533
- Devils
- Kill them!

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.076
- Savages
- Savages

01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:21.578
What are we waiting for?

01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:25.248
Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:30.962
How loud are the drums ofwar?

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:35.300
Now we see what comes
oftrying to be chums

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:40.764
Is the death of all I love
carried in the drumming of

01:07:40.931 --> 01:07:42.140
- War
- No!

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:49.439
If you kill him,
you'll have to kill me too.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.816
Daughter, stand back.

01:07:51.984 --> 01:07:55.945
I won't! I love him, Father.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.578
Look around you.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.998
This is where the path
of hatred has brought us.

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:12.087
This is the path I choose, Father.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.755
What will yours be?

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:52.377
My daughter speaks
with a wisdom beyond her years.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.712
We have all come here
with anger in our hearts,

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.966
but she comes with
courage and understanding.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:04.013
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing,

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.349
it will not start with me.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:10.895
Release him.

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:31.082
Now is our chance! Fire!

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.042
- No.
- What?

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.752
- They let him go!
- They don't want to fight!

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:39.090
It's a trick, don't you see? Fire!

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.805
Fine! I'll settle this myself.

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:49.434
No!

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:51.978
John!

01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:58.943
You shot him!

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:02.614
He stepped right into it!
It's his own fault!

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.283
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.535
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.704
Unhand me, I say. How dare you!

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.623
Put him in chains!

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.209
I'll see you all hanged for this!

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.044
And gag him as well!

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.849
Is he going to make it, Thomas?

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:31.809
The sooner he gets to England,
the better.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:33.645
Let's hope the wind is with him.

01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:36.147
- Is the ship ready yet?
- Any minute now.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.942
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:46.491
Untie me at once!
I'll have your head for this!

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.827
And he came so highly recommended.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:00.505
The ship's almost ready.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.299
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:06.844
No, not yet. She said she'd be here.

01:11:07.888 --> 01:11:09.264
Look.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.709
Going back is his only chance.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.378
He'll die if he stays here.

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:50.555
Here.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.057
It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.059
It'll help with the pain.

01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:58.479
What pain?
I've had worse pain than this.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.566
Can't think of any right now, but...

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:11.409
You are always welcome
among our people.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.911
Thank you, my brother.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:19.208
I thought you didn't like strangers.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.261
My mother's necklace.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.516
See ya, Percy.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.285
Come with me?

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.250
You must choose your own path.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.684
I'm needed here.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.730
Then... I'll stay with you.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.733
No. You have to go back.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.653
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:32.990
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you...

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:35.034
...forever.

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:05.189
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.698
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.783
Set the mainsails.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.538
Weigh anchor!

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:23.791
Let go of the topgallants!
