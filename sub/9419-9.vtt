06:20.247 --> 06:22.047
Anything mean about anyone.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.948
Even when she says that she's

06:22.950 --> 06:24.349
Had, like, a bad day, she

06:24.351 --> 06:25.584
Doesn't say it was because of

06:25.586 --> 06:26.251
Anyone.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.419
She doesn't say anything hateful

06:27.421 --> 06:28.620
At all, really.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.654
>> have you ever asked her to

06:29.656 --> 06:30.622
Video chat?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.257
>> I honestly never asked her.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.692
It was probably only a few

06:33.694 --> 06:34.626
Months ago that I bought my

06:34.628 --> 06:35.560
Webcam.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.661
>> have you sent her some

06:36.663 --> 06:38.230
Richard pics?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.765
>> what's a richard pic?

06:39.767 --> 06:40.899
>> has she seen your johnson?

06:40.901 --> 06:41.900
>> yes.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.901
>> is your face in the picture?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.503
>> it should be.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.470
>> no, it shouldn't be.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.538
>> whoo, it just got warm in

06:46.540 --> 06:47.539
Here.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.607
>> has she ever sent you a

06:48.609 --> 06:50.308
Picture of her naked with her

06:50.310 --> 06:51.243
Face?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.444
>> no.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.512
>> that's another red flag.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.646
>> so either she's smarter than

06:54.648 --> 06:55.580
You...

06:55.582 --> 06:56.615
>> military versus nurse.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.549
I'm pretty sure she's smarter

06:57.551 --> 06:58.216
Than me.

06:58.218 --> 06:58.884
>> yeah.

06:58.886 --> 06:59.551
All of our girlfriends are

06:59.553 --> 07:01.219
Smarter than us.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.888
It definitely does seem like

07:02.890 --> 07:03.855
Something's up.

07:03.857 --> 07:04.523
>> mm-hmm.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.991
>> as much as I want this girl

07:05.993 --> 07:08.493
To be your dream girl, and as

07:08.495 --> 07:10.295
Much as I want you to end up

07:10.297 --> 07:11.863
Together and your dogs to

07:11.865 --> 07:13.665
Frolic and mate and make

07:13.667 --> 07:16.768
Puppies, as much as I want that,

07:16.770 --> 07:17.602
The reality is there's some

07:17.604 --> 07:18.570
Things about this relationship

07:18.572 --> 07:22.908
That don't feel totally kosher.

07:22.910 --> 07:23.975
>> if, like, I find out

07:23.977 --> 07:24.743
Somebody that was--she was

07:24.745 --> 07:25.911
Lying to me, I would be a little

07:25.913 --> 07:26.645
Betrayed about it.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.779
I'm still gonna talk to her.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.080
I'm still gonna, like, give it

07:29.082 --> 07:31.283
Some go at a chance.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.485
Perfect scenario: I would be

07:33.487 --> 07:35.353
With her anywhere.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.622
>> I'm really curious to see

07:37.624 --> 07:38.390
What you've got as far as

07:38.392 --> 07:39.691
Facebook page and text

07:39.693 --> 07:40.792
Messaging.

07:40.794 --> 07:41.460
>> yeah, we got to see the

07:41.462 --> 07:42.194
Evidence.

07:42.196 --> 07:45.497
>> where all the magic happens.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.164
Here we go.

07:46.166 --> 07:46.965
So, yeah.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.233
Cute, blonde, nice teeth.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.534
>> very nice teeth.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.036
>> yeah, nice smile.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.237
>> 456 pictures.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.405
This is very positive.

07:53.407 --> 07:54.973
>> she's gone through the

07:54.975 --> 07:56.241
Trouble of filling out all of

07:56.243 --> 07:58.176
These profile questions.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.311
Oh, is that her dog?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.246
>> yeah, that's zeus.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.280
>> can you hear her in the husky

08:02.282 --> 08:03.281
Videos?

08:03.283 --> 08:04.216
>> yeah.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.885
[dog barking]

08:06.887 --> 08:08.053
>> aw.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.489
>> see?

08:10.491 --> 08:11.623
>> wow, here it is.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.491
Look, the very beginning.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.826
So June 4, 2013, she sent you

08:14.828 --> 08:15.660
A message.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.561
"I hit add by accident.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.529
I'm sorry."

08:17.531 --> 08:18.463
You said, "lol, it's okay, you

08:18.465 --> 08:19.498
Don't need to apologize."

08:19.500 --> 08:20.899
>> wow, that's the beginning

08:20.901 --> 08:21.566
Of the relationship.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.534
>> yeah, that's amazing.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.836
The big question now is, are you

08:24.838 --> 08:26.705
Ready and are you even available

08:26.707 --> 08:28.707
Right now if we come back here

08:28.709 --> 08:29.941
Tomorrow morning and say, like,

08:29.943 --> 08:31.142
We got her, to get on an

08:31.144 --> 08:32.510
Airplane and go and meet her?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.645
>> I can't.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.645
>> you can't?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.414
So we would have to bring her

08:36.416 --> 08:38.015
Here, because you're busy with

08:38.018 --> 08:38.783
The military.

08:38.784 --> 08:39.583
>> yes.

08:39.586 --> 08:40.318
>> all right, well, that's

08:40.320 --> 08:41.019
Interesting.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.686
We've never done that.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.655
>> and if she's at all reluctant

08:43.657 --> 08:45.524
About showing herself--it is a

08:45.526 --> 08:47.559
Harder thing to do.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.426
>> so we'll just have to wait

08:48.428 --> 08:49.261
And see.

08:49.263 --> 08:50.295
All right, well, we've got

08:50.297 --> 08:51.296
Our marching orders.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.097
All right, we'll see you later,

08:52.099 --> 08:52.764
Man.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.431
>> okay.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.233
>> later, jeff.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.269
>> I think this guy is afraid to

08:57.271 --> 08:59.437
Admit just how into this girl he

08:59.439 --> 09:00.572
Is.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.606
>> ♪ can you see me

09:01.608 --> 09:02.574
♪ count to three?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.209
♪ no, I won't play ♪

09:04.211 --> 09:06.645
♪ your hide-and-seek

09:06.647 --> 09:08.380
>> if she doesn't turn out to be

09:08.382 --> 09:09.447
The person he thought she was,

09:09.449 --> 09:10.582
Then I think he's really gonna

09:10.584 --> 09:11.683
Be devastated.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.851
>> he's basically putting all of

09:12.853 --> 09:15.820
His eggs in this megan basket.

09:15.822 --> 09:21.393
>> get away from me.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.661
Stop looking for excuses to

09:22.663 --> 09:23.828
Touch me.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.563
>> we finish each other's

09:24.565 --> 09:25.497
Sentences.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.465
It's so adorable.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.802
>> I'm filing with h.R.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.238
>> so look, jeff met megan...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.072
>> both: A year ago.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.407
>> looked like they were moving

09:35.409 --> 09:36.441
Towards a relationship.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.609
>> then he went to visit her.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.077
>> in fort worth, texas.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.111
Nothing.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.546
Texts, calls, no response.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.715
Then finally she says, "oh, my

09:43.717 --> 09:46.017
God, I had a family emergency.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.252
So sorry."

09:47.254 --> 09:48.820
He knows there's something a

09:48.822 --> 09:49.854
Little fishy here.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.089
>> right.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.257
>> well, here's what we've got.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.558
Megan's phone number, her

09:53.560 --> 09:55.093
Birthday: May 3rd.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.461
We've got the address that he

09:56.463 --> 09:57.929
Sent those flowers to.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.699
Here's megan's facebook profile.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.968
Most of her posts don't have

10:02.970 --> 10:04.436
More than one or two comments,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.871
Most of which are jeff.

10:06.873 --> 10:11.109
Memes, art, and huskies.

10:11.111 --> 10:11.843
It looks like her profile's

10:11.845 --> 10:13.211
Pretty buttoned up.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.880
All right, I am image searching.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.782
And...

10:17.784 --> 10:19.017
>> oh, man.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.119
>> image number two.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.153
>> nothing.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.221
Oh!

>> should we run a phone number?

10:24.625 --> 10:25.523
>> let's run the phone number.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.925
>> all right, here's her number.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.093
We're searching it.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.861
>> all right.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.762
Yeah, we got one!

10:30.764 --> 10:31.696
>> oh, boy.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.631
Interesting.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.665
>> brandy [bleep].

10:33.667 --> 10:35.200
>> so this is brandy from fort

10:35.202 --> 10:38.436
Worth, texas, who is registered

10:38.438 --> 10:39.137
To the phone number he had for

10:39.139 --> 10:40.138
Megan.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.006
>> look, look, look.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.140
The same address.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.743
Exactly where the flowers went.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.977
>> let's look up brandy [bleep]

10:45.979 --> 10:47.646
On facebook.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.680
>> look, texas.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.614
The first one.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.915
And what do we got?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.150
[both gasp]

10:52.152 --> 10:53.551
>> all the same memes.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.854
And even more interestingly,

10:55.856 --> 10:57.055
She's part of the group

10:57.057 --> 10:59.491
Malamutes & huskies.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.359
Megan is a member of that page.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.293
>> oh, look, that's her

11:02.295 --> 11:03.228
Birthday.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.729
>> the same birthday as megan.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.764
>> may 3rd.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.965
Wow, so this could be the

11:06.967 --> 11:08.066
Same girl.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.467
>> but we don't know what she

11:09.469 --> 11:10.535
Looks like.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.203
There's privacy settings.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.772
From what we can see, there's a

11:13.774 --> 11:15.774
Girl named brandy who so far

11:15.776 --> 11:17.375
Matches a lot of the details--

11:17.377 --> 11:18.877
>> her birthday's may 3rd, which

11:18.879 --> 11:20.879
Is exactly when megan's birthday

11:20.881 --> 11:21.813
Is.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.881
She loves dogs.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.849
The phone number for megan links

11:24.851 --> 11:27.185
Us to brandy [bleep].

11:27.187 --> 11:28.787
>> I think we got her, dude.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.089
>> we got her.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.323
>> let's go tell jeff what we

11:32.325 --> 11:33.525
Found.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.259
And if we're gonna get this

11:34.261 --> 11:35.927
Girl, we got to start the wheels

11:35.929 --> 11:37.529
Moving now.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.097
[knocks on door]

11:39.099 --> 11:40.065
Hey, man.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.132
>> how's it going?

11:41.134 --> 11:42.300
>> all right.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.435
Let's get down to business here.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.236
First thing we did was we ran

11:45.238 --> 11:45.904
The phone number.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.172
And this was really interesting.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.540
It came up with a name brandy

11:48.542 --> 11:50.608
[bleep], also from texas, and

11:50.610 --> 11:52.377
There's even an address--

11:52.379 --> 11:53.878
The same address that you sent

11:53.880 --> 11:56.047
Those flowers to.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.415
When we searched brandy on

11:57.417 --> 12:00.085
Facebook, we found a profile for

12:00.087 --> 12:01.720
Someone who clearly lives in

12:01.722 --> 12:02.921
Texas with the name brandy

12:02.923 --> 12:04.055
[bleep], so we thought, okay,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.857
Let's look into this.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.225
So we go to the profile, and

12:07.227 --> 12:09.027
Unfortunately it's buttoned up.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.596
All we can see are banner

12:11.598 --> 12:12.564
Photos.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.832
So we started going through

12:13.834 --> 12:14.999
Those.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.301
This is where we had sort of

12:16.303 --> 12:19.170
Like an "aha" moment, because I

12:19.172 --> 12:21.740
Don't know if you recognize, but

12:21.742 --> 12:25.744
A bunch of the images on here

12:25.746 --> 12:27.412
Are the same as the ones on

12:27.414 --> 12:31.583
Megan's profile.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.685
Now, the internet's full of

12:33.687 --> 12:35.620
These things, so you could say,

12:35.622 --> 12:36.721
Oh, well, lots of people post

12:36.723 --> 12:37.856
And share.

12:37.858 --> 12:38.823
>> mm-hmm.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.058
>> but I think there's starting

12:40.060 --> 12:41.593
To be an interesting parallel

22:31.484 --> 22:32.550
I am not gonna keep the camera

22:32.552 --> 22:33.851
In my hand for this, because I

22:33.853 --> 22:35.219
Think that that's just gonna,

22:35.221 --> 22:38.456
Like, be more intimidating for

22:38.458 --> 22:41.225
Her, so I'm gonna hand it off.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.126
I assume she's coming from that

22:42.128 --> 22:45.162
Way.

Except for, like, my job and my

23:17.597 --> 23:18.929
Pictures and my name.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.964

23:27.473 --> 23:28.873
Don't know really how to, like,

Tell somebody that.

23:31.911 --> 23:32.810
Doing this.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.778
I know that definitely took a

23:33.780 --> 23:34.712
Lot of guts.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.447
Why do you have a profile online

23:36.449 --> 23:39.417
That's of someone else entirely?

23:39.419 --> 23:40.584
>> the whole reason I started it

23:40.586 --> 23:42.887
Was, like, I was in a really,

23:42.889 --> 23:45.823
Really bad relationship, and it

23:45.825 --> 23:46.857
Was a really abusive

23:46.859 --> 23:47.958
Relationship.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.361
And some things happened, and...

23:50.363 --> 23:57.301
Just completely, like, lost all

23:57.303 --> 23:58.969
My self-esteem.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.037
I guess I got, like, really

24:00.039 --> 24:01.105
Depressed and just didn't want

24:01.107 --> 24:02.606
To be myself anymore.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.707
I just, like, kind of wanted to

24:03.709 --> 24:05.776
Get away.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.784
That's kind of what I need,

24:46.786 --> 24:47.518
Because I've been with such

24:47.520 --> 24:48.619
Jerks in the past.

24:48.621 --> 24:49.520
And, like, that's what I'm

But I'm just--that's, like, my

25:01.934 --> 25:03.100
Biggest fear, is him just, like,

25:03.102 --> 25:04.869
To hate me.

25:04.871 --> 25:05.936
Like, I would understand,

25:05.938 --> 25:06.937

25:06.939 --> 25:09.473
Somebody did it to me, like, if

25:29.595 --> 25:30.494
Now.

Kind of sit down with you in

39:44.149 --> 39:46.850
Hopefully you and brandy can

39:46.852 --> 39:48.852
Figure something out.

Like, a week, so I don't know

40:12.344 --> 40:13.276

But I've been going to

Of admit that I needed help.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.361
I'm glad I went on this show and

40:31.363 --> 40:32.595
Decided to do it, because, I

40:32.597 --> 40:35.098
Mean, if I wouldn't have, I--

40:35.100 --> 40:36.032
I don't know where I'd be right
