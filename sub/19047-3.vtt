Hey, I like
your haircut, man.
What's going on up here?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.243
You can't tell.
Charlie, it's a bald cap.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.812
<i>It's not even real!</i>
<i>You can't tell, huh?</i>
Oh, my God!

19:41.814 --> 19:43.981
<i>[ Charlie ] That's awesome!</i>
<i>[ Dee ]</i>
<i>No, you can you can tell.</i>

19:43.983 --> 19:47.585
<i>- [ Charlie ] You say you were</i>
<i>gonna piss in the fountain?</i>
- You're in it.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.154
Hey, Dennis!
What's up, buddy?
Come here!

19:50.156 --> 19:51.689
What you doing?
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:54.358
Huh?
I use this fountain
for its healing powers.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.595
Plus, it does wonders for my
skin. [ Gibberish ] But that's
not important right now!

19:57.597 --> 20:01.599
- You're not gonna believe this.
Sinbad was trying to kill me!
- What?

20:01.601 --> 20:05.469
Yeah, Sinbad the comedian.
He was in the rehab center.
He was trying to kill me.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.639
And then Rob Thomas,
the lead singer of Matchbox 20?
He was in there too.

20:08.641 --> 20:12.109
- Is any of that making sense?
- No.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.647
Uh, time-time out, time
out, time out. Did you
or did you not meet Sinbad?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.083
Yeah. I met Sinbad. But--
Can you prove
that stuff?

20:19.085 --> 20:21.219
Oh, yeah.
This happened just moments ago!

20:21.221 --> 20:23.154
Boom!
Memoir's back on.
Me!

20:23.156 --> 20:26.090
Rob Thomas is a douche bag, but
the public eats that shit up!
Yeah!

20:26.092 --> 20:28.326
The memoirs thing is done!
We gotta go back
to that rehab.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.595
No, no!
We can't go back there!
That's too dangerous!

20:30.597 --> 20:33.664
No, we have to prove it.
We gotta take photos.
We have to sign documents.

20:33.666 --> 20:37.935
- Dude, I'm a huge Sinbad fan!
- Sinbad is not the man
that you think he is, Charlie!

20:37.937 --> 20:40.538
We'll take care of you.
We'll watch your back.
I am not going back!

20:40.540 --> 20:43.241
I'd like to meet him.
I hope he's wearing something
made out of windbreaker.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.311
Okay, guys. This is it.
[ Mac ]
What the hell is this?

20:47.313 --> 20:52.617
It's the rehab center.
That's not the rehab center.
That's the rehab center.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.453
<i>Well, this is where</i>
<i>they brought me after</i>
<i>you guys dropped me off.</i>

20:55.455 --> 20:58.222
Everybody, you gotta
stay close to me, okay?
You have to protect me,

20:58.224 --> 21:01.058
because like most comedians
Sinbad is very angry
on the inside.

21:01.060 --> 21:05.196
Come on. Come on!
Do you think he'll, like,
autograph my shirt? Or, like--

21:05.198 --> 21:08.933
He will autograph your face
until it is bloody to a pulp.
Now come on!

21:08.935 --> 21:13.170
<i>So, like--</i>
<i>like what is this place, dude?</i>
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>

21:13.172 --> 21:16.407
Hey!
Oh, hell, no!

21:16.409 --> 21:18.476
We told you not
to come back here,
freak!

21:18.478 --> 21:20.144
Wh-Where's Sinbad?

21:20.146 --> 21:24.115
Oh, you call me Sinbad
one more time,
I'm gonna knock you out.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.018
- What the hell
is going on here?
- This dude broke in here,

21:27.020 --> 21:30.588
and has been running around
ranting and raving
about memoirs and Sinbad!

21:30.590 --> 21:33.424
So--
So you lied to us,
Dennis?

21:33.426 --> 21:36.227
No, I didn't lie.
No, I swear to God.
This was all real.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.497
- Sinbad was here, I swear!
- That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.365
You thought that
dude was Sinbad.
This guy?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.067
Maybe that blow to the head
did a little more damage
than we thought.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.169
That's not Sinbad, dude!
I know that's
not Sinbad!

21:45.171 --> 21:47.505
Is this some sort
of sick fantasy?
No, it's not a fantasy!

21:47.507 --> 21:50.474
I didn't make it up!
Sinbad was here! I swear!
Well, guess what, guy?

21:50.476 --> 21:54.912
The memoir is dead again!
I can't believe
you didn't meet Sinbad!

21:54.914 --> 21:57.315
Do you even realize how excited
I was to meet Sinbad!

21:57.317 --> 21:59.417
Sinbad's a hilarious comedian.
Goddamn it.
Son of a bitch.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.319
That guy is like some dude
in green pants.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.055
I don't even see how
this could be happening.
It all seemed so real.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.657
<i>[ Door Closes ]</i>
I need to see a doctor.

22:06.659 --> 22:11.028
<i>Psst.</i>
<i>No, you don't, bitch!</i>

22:12.230 --> 22:14.765
-<i> Wake up! Yeah,</i>
<i>you in hell all right!</i>
- Ow!

22:14.767 --> 22:17.501
- Oh, what the hell, man?
- Hell, no!

22:17.503 --> 22:19.570
<i>You call me Sinbad</i>
<i>one more time--</i>

22:24.576 --> 22:26.844
Yeah. I should definitely
see a doctor.
