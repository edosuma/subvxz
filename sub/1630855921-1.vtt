00:07.311 --> 00:08.660
What's that noise?

00:34.425 --> 00:35.731
Eddie?
Did you forget something?

00:35.905 --> 00:38.038
Mike!
No, no!

00:39.865 --> 00:41.998
Help me! Help me!

00:42.172 --> 00:43.434
Please, help!

00:43.608 --> 00:45.480
Help me!

00:48.787 --> 00:50.398
<i>Fucking</i>
<i>restraining order, Kate?</i>

00:50.572 --> 00:53.488
<i>Mike, stop!</i>
<i>Ah, Mike, stop!</i>

01:02.540 --> 01:03.889
<i>Help me!</i>

01:54.157 --> 01:55.463
You came in today?

02:00.250 --> 02:03.123
Um, had to finish
last night's totals.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.560
Go get some rest.
I'll do it.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.345
I'm a big girl, Eddie.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.132
<i>Pills don't work for me.</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:16.397
Just help me out,
please.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.355
Okay? Call him.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.228
I-- I--
I can't concentrate, okay?

02:21.402 --> 02:22.664
It's got me fucked up.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.709
I see his face everywhere.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.321
I know I'm being
a terrible friend, but please,

02:27.495 --> 02:29.018
just ask your brother
to set it up.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.064
Mike almost
took your eye, Kate.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.501
You need
to go back to group,

02:33.675 --> 02:36.112
not into the woods,
by yourself.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.159
All those women,
staring at me...

02:40.072 --> 02:42.162
I don't like it, okay?
Just help me out.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.467
See if they need people.

02:43.641 --> 02:44.947
Call him.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.733
We don't talk much anymore.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.694
Nick, it's been two days

02:52.868 --> 02:54.565
and they still
haven't found Mike.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.001
He'll come.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.995
When you find a fire,
then what do you do?

04:18.170 --> 04:21.391
Generally, you call it in
and you give a reading,

04:21.565 --> 04:23.393
something called
an azimuth reading,

04:23.567 --> 04:26.614
where it kind of shows you
where in the sky the fire is.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.616
So, you, like,
did some research?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.313
Yeah, you have to.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.097
You have to take a class
to be able to do this.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.882
I'm proud of you.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.666
So, you really ready?
It's me you're talking to.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.407
I'm really ready, Nickie.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.888
This is the best thing for me,
I promise you.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.760
Did you bring one?
Do they have one?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.806
- I gotta get one.
- You gotta get one.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.025
- I definitely do.
- Do they have a store?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.044
Nah, I don't need a bag.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.180
Her birthday today.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.356
Well,
you told me yesterday. Heh.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.010
- All right.
- Happy birthday.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.317
Thanks, Hal.

05:19.231 --> 05:20.755
- How you doing?
- Good.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.863
Good morning.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.578
Have a good one.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.146
You, too.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.641
Earl.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.382
Hi.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.999
A room with your sister
for two years in the city,

06:31.173 --> 06:32.522
and we end up meeting
on the mountain.

06:32.696 --> 06:35.003
Hmm. Nice to meet you, Kate.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.962
Hi, Nick.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.358
Uh, thanks for doing this.
I know it wasn't easy.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.276
It's good to see you.

06:48.495 --> 06:51.106
- You, too.
- How's Corinne?

06:52.716 --> 06:55.893
She's uh-- she's good.
Um, nice of you to ask.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.679
Look, Nick, uh,

06:58.853 --> 07:00.420
I know the plan was for me
to drive you down to Sandpoint,

07:00.594 --> 07:02.509
but a spot fire just
went up by Bonners Ferry,

07:02.683 --> 07:04.162
so I gotta
keep an eye on it.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.077
Dan's gonna have to drive you--

07:06.251 --> 07:07.775
...now, otherwise,
you'll miss the last train.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.646
Catch up
when you come back,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.169
after Kate serves
her three months?

07:11.343 --> 07:12.910
We'll do it then,
I promise.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.390
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.914
Uh, I got you something.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.701
It's from
when Dad was at Fairchild.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.666
- See you in three months.
- Yeah.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.063
Okay, paperwork this way.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.241
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.114
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.551
Thanks for driving up.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.815
- All right, you got this?
- Yeah.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.947
- Don't let him give you shit.
- Okay.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.427
Drive safe.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.563
Okay, standard release
and liability stuff.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.435
ILD Fire emailed me
your first aid certificate.

07:59.609 --> 08:00.828
You have
survival training, correct?

08:01.002 --> 08:03.004
A little,
mainly medical at Wazoo.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.833
- I aced the Osborne course.
- Got the e-mail.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.619
Okay.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.186
You are officially

08:11.360 --> 08:13.231
an Idaho Lands
Department volunteer.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.800
Thank you, Earl.
I know you pulled some strings.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.063
Yeah, well, uh,
we need the help.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.589
That her?

08:24.329 --> 08:26.331
Yeah, day after
the big fire.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.203
Hell all around her,
but she didn't go down.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.683
Mm.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.641
That had to feel good.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.732
No. It was a terrible day.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.338
Thank you.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.472
Everybody walks from here.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.085
Fire take
the rest of the road?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.695
Took a lot more than that.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.763
<i>Katie, my lady.</i>

09:54.898 --> 09:57.292
Coyotes.
Better get used to it.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.604
All right,
that's your bathroom.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.867
Pit toilet,
ten feet deep.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.782
Sometimes
hikers want to use it,

10:08.956 --> 10:10.610
mostly women.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.960
- It's a squeeze, though.
- Eh, tight spaces relax me.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.676
Had their heyday
from 1930 to 1950.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.983
After the Big Burn o' 1910,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.332
Uncle Sam said
the States had to bear

10:37.506 --> 10:38.768
the cost of firefighting.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.205
Forest Service
was only five years old then.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.903
It's still pretty small.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.123
Just didn't have enough men
to protect that many acres.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.690
Uh, still don't, really.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.388
Anyway, all these towers
went up as a result.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.426
It's beautiful.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.863
Yeah, on a clear day,

11:30.037 --> 11:31.995
the viewshed'll give you
over 100 miles.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.563
Not today, though.
Fire's up in Kootenai.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.747
Here she is.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.837
Yep. Osborne Fire Finder.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.709
Tells us where to go
if you see smoke,

11:49.883 --> 11:51.319
which brings us to...

11:53.321 --> 11:54.670
On, off.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.238
Send, receive.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.458
Reports twice a day,
first thing in the morning,

12:00.632 --> 12:02.591
so we know that Bigfoot
didn't get you at 7:00 a.m.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.115
Next thing, 4:00 p.m.,

12:05.289 --> 12:07.291
uh, weather reports,
humidity measurements,

12:07.465 --> 12:08.858
last rain.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.907
Fifteen days ago.
We need to have that.

12:14.864 --> 12:18.825
So, you got no water,
Wi-Fi, or plumbing,

12:18.999 --> 12:20.348
but you got electricity.
like I said.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.784
The heater's right there

12:21.958 --> 12:23.220
and the wood stove
if you need it.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.700
Okay. And the garbage?

12:24.874 --> 12:26.136
Oh, Hal at the store
lets us dump it

12:26.310 --> 12:27.572
in the back of his truck.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.673
- Okay. You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.329
Routine is key.
Your head needs that.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.505
Three months
is a long time, so...

12:48.158 --> 12:49.986
Be on that radio,
7:00 sharp.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.163
Scope, lunch, second report,
supper, maybe a book, then bed.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.686
Rinse and repeat.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.298
- Stick to the routine.
- Stick to the routine.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.169
Yeah.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.217
Oh, sorry,
it's been a long time

13:03.391 --> 13:05.001
since we had
a female volunteer.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.525
That's totally fine.
I get it. Yeah.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.224
Well, thank you.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.182
Thank you again, Earl.
You're a good guy.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
I see why Nickie's so sad
you drifted.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.233
Oh, uh--

13:19.668 --> 13:21.322
well, as you know, uh,
Corinne is, uh--

13:21.496 --> 13:23.150
She hates
that Nickie's gay, yeah.

13:26.457 --> 13:29.243
Corinne is a believer,
but she doesn't hate my sister.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.161
Mm.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.902
Anything you need,
you call.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.730
Yep.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.105
Where's the thing?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.284
Oh, shit. Okay.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.554
Okay.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.116
Earl, is that you?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.381
<i>Earl, is that you?</i>

17:26.958 --> 17:29.309
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.982
- Hey, hey, I just want to talk.
- Mike, how the fuck?

17:51.592 --> 17:52.897
Look...

17:54.682 --> 17:55.987
Baby.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.381
Mike.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.949
- You really can't be here.
- I just love--

18:03.995 --> 18:05.693
Damn it, Kate, stop!

18:06.346 --> 18:08.870
Babe, come on!

18:10.698 --> 18:11.960
Stop!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.580
Kate!

18:26.366 --> 18:29.673
Kate, stop.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.415
- Let go. Leave me alone.
- Kate, stop.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.461
- Go away.
- I'm sorry.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.769
- Please, come back.
- Kate.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.862
No.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.520
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay, okay.

18:50.694 --> 18:53.219
You're okay, you're okay...

19:02.228 --> 19:06.971
Okay. You're okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

19:12.673 --> 19:13.935
You're okay.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
<i>Katie, my lady.</i>

19:33.389 --> 19:35.217
<i>You're 30 minutes late.</i>
<i>7:00 a.m., Kate.</i>

19:35.391 --> 19:37.741
I'm sorry, Earl.
I'm really sorry.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.526
<i>You need</i>
<i>to follow protocol, Kate.</i>

19:39.700 --> 19:41.441
Of course. Yes, I will.

19:46.446 --> 19:47.925
Who else knows
I'm up here?

19:48.404 --> 19:50.014
<i>Uh, just ILD</i>
<i>and the townies,</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:51.755
<i>no one outside </i>

19:52.365 --> 19:53.583
Mm-hmm.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.672
And who's closest to me?

19:56.456 --> 19:58.414
<i>Uh, Reggie Banfield,</i>
<i>retired doctor.</i>

19:58.588 --> 20:00.764
<i>He's got a cabin about</i>

20:00.938 --> 20:03.376
<i>Moody, but a good guy.</i>
<i>Used to volunteer.</i>

20:06.988 --> 20:08.685
Listen, Kate,

20:08.859 --> 20:10.774
if you're having doubts,
now is the time.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.341
Can't have you
deserting your post

20:12.515 --> 20:13.777
<i>in the middle</i>
<i>of the night.</i>

20:13.951 --> 20:15.170
No, no.
Absolutely, I could do this.

<i>Okay, I believe you.</i>

Okay.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.867
- Thank you.
- Yep.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.782
Out of food already?

24:41.392 --> 24:42.872
- Yeah.
- You're a hungry girl.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.615
Uh, ants got my food.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.139
Oh, I've been there,
believe me.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.185
Ranger Dan.
I work with Earl.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.013
Welcome to the mountain.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.581
Uh, yeah, I-- I saw you
the other day at the work yard.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.932
Yeah, but, you know,
we didn't officially meet.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.368
Kate Riley.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.326
Hmm, I hope
you plan to hustle

25:02.501 --> 25:04.198
right back up there,
young lady.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.113
Reg.

25:07.288 --> 25:10.421
This ball of sunshine
is Reggie Banfield.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.337
- He's your neighbor.
- Oh, right. Earl mentioned.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.644
Uh, I think I saw you in here
the other day.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.691
Yeah, bought my wife
a birthday cake.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.216
- Happy belated to her.
- She's dead.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.219
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.613
I'm not.
She left me millions.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.966
She--

25:33.444 --> 25:34.707
You're funny.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.797
Ah.
Uh, tha-- that's my joke.

25:37.971 --> 25:40.843
Sorry, we don't know each other
well enough yet.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.106
She was a super lady, ma'am.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.152
I'm sure she was.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.936
Hal, from now on,

25:47.110 --> 25:48.285
why don't you put
anything she needs

25:48.459 --> 25:50.549
on the, uh,
station's tab?

25:51.375 --> 25:52.899
Really nice of you.
Thank you.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.075
You just let us know
if you need anything.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.252
Will do.
Nice to meet you.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.341
Nice to meet you.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.562
Excuse me.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.216
Do you have
a shovel I could borrow?

26:09.437 --> 26:10.786
Ah, yeah.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.223
You're lucky.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.704
I just helped
dig a fire line last month.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.140
Just go ahead
and leave it with Hal

26:17.314 --> 26:18.620
on your next trash trip.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.317
- Will do.
- Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.884
No worries.
Thank you very much, Ranger Dan.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.320
Yeah, you betcha.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.530
Excuse me?

27:00.096 --> 27:02.229
Well, hey.
We're a little lost.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.144
Looking for Raglan Peak.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.189
Can you put that out, please?
That's a fire hazard.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.714
This?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.411
Sure, totally.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.501
Oh, man.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.111
Shit.

27:22.597 --> 27:23.859
Got it.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.998
Does she look
like Vicky to you?

27:32.172 --> 27:33.216
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.565
I thought so.

27:39.483 --> 27:40.746
Where did you guys
pitch last night?

27:41.877 --> 27:43.705
We were just around
around that bend back there.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.402
There's no campfires up here.

27:46.012 --> 27:48.449
Yeah, we had to do
a little snuggling.

27:48.623 --> 27:49.972
You could've joined.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.282
Raglan Peak
is eight miles along the saddle.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.023
No loop, out and back.

27:58.633 --> 27:59.895
Just you up here?

28:02.115 --> 28:03.682
Maybe we'll see you
on the way back.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.344
Okay. Okay...

29:08.572 --> 29:10.444
There you go.
Maybe we'll just pack it.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.012
Okay.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.712
It was against protocol, Kate.
That's not how we do it.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.933
- Who cares? I put out a fire.
- <i>I care.</i>

29:21.107 --> 29:22.499
I commend the effort,

29:22.673 --> 29:24.240
but you missed
the afternoon report.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.199
<i>- You need to stay in that tower.</i>
- Come on, Earl.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.027
<i>It was too close</i>
<i>to the tower.</i>

29:28.201 --> 29:29.942
<i>Relative humidity was very low,</i>

29:30.116 --> 29:31.813
atmosphere unstable,

29:31.987 --> 29:33.119
so vertical air movement
was a factor.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.121
The fire was too high.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.905
<i>If I called it in</i>
<i>by the time anyone got there,</i>

29:37.079 --> 29:38.298
<i>it would've been</i>
<i>out of control.</i>

29:43.564 --> 29:44.783
It was the right call, Kate.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.481
But you need to stay
in my tower, over and out.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.137
Whatever, bro,
I nailed it.

29:52.355 --> 29:55.315
<i>...Northern Idaho</i>
<i>and Eastern Washington</i>

29:55.489 --> 29:58.405
<i>for Wednesday,</i>
<i>July 7th. In Clark...</i>

30:06.587 --> 30:08.241
What do you want,
Miss Riley?

30:08.415 --> 30:09.677
I put out a fire.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.376
Well--

30:16.249 --> 30:17.511
- I'm just-- I'm between jobs...
- Ah!

30:17.685 --> 30:19.426
...so, just here
for three months.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.037
Oh, just, uh--

30:22.211 --> 30:25.040
I found the longer you stay
on the mountain,

30:25.214 --> 30:28.522
the deeper
the mountain stays in you.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.612
Mm, weird thing to say,
but okay.

30:31.786 --> 30:32.961
No, I'm...

30:34.789 --> 30:36.095
Just came
for the peace and quiet.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.968
There's no peace in nature.

30:41.013 --> 30:44.799
And, uh, being all alone
up here may be silent...

30:46.018 --> 30:47.236
it won't be quiet.

30:48.150 --> 30:51.197
Hmm.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.510
- How long you know Earl?
- Uh, three years.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.773
Yeah, since he started
as a lookout.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.950
I even did it
for a couple of summers

31:05.124 --> 31:07.300
when I got up here,
20 years ago.

31:07.474 --> 31:08.997
Ooh, 20 years?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.695
I wasn't alone
the whole time.

31:12.435 --> 31:15.047
Had my wife
for nearly half of it.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.483
That's Bunny.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.007
Now, what I call her, anyway.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.357
- Hmm.
- This is her knife.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.362
Uh, morning report was stable?

31:27.146 --> 31:30.671
- High pressure, yeah.
- Well, uh, Have a bite.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.282
I'll tell you about her.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.290
That the garden
where you grew her medicine?

31:41.464 --> 31:42.901
It is.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.468
Soil up here
is like the Hubei Region.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.602
Worms love it,
so there's plenty of castings.

31:48.776 --> 31:52.171
Gets those rare Chinese herbs
real potent.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.522
So, I made her tea to drink,
instead of those damn pills.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.741
- And it worked?
- Her doctors,

31:57.916 --> 32:00.744
my colleagues,
gave her two years.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.312
She went 12,
thanks to me.

32:07.012 --> 32:08.622
Kate?

32:08.796 --> 32:10.058
Are you okay?

32:10.711 --> 32:12.017
Y-- you went down.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.368
That really jolted you.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.458
- Sorry.
- Wait here, uh--

32:31.906 --> 32:34.387
Help me! Help me!

32:45.964 --> 32:48.749
No, no, no!

32:50.707 --> 32:52.013
No!

32:53.188 --> 32:55.712
Y-- y-- you're okay.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.934
It's okay.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.936
Uh, take a tablespoon of this,

33:02.110 --> 33:03.459
steep it, drink it.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.722
It'll relax those nerves.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.898
- I-- I should go.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.509
Get back up in that tower.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.832
Somebody's in here.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.097
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.838
Oh! I thought it was jammed.
I didn't mean to scare you.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.971
I mean,
people use it all the time

33:37.145 --> 33:38.494
when they hike this area.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.889
Yeah, I-- I-- I heard that.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.587
I'm so sorry, dear.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.547
No, no,
it's-- it's, uh, totally fine.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.940
- Have at it.
- Oh, thank you.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.596
Last time I went in the bushes,
I sat on some nettles.

33:53.770 --> 33:56.686
My clacker hurt for a week.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.428
Oh, my goodness.

33:59.602 --> 34:01.039
- Smell this.
- Yeah.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.719
Hey, Reg.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.808
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.464
What do you want?

35:19.508 --> 35:21.075
Oh, oh, nothing, nothing.
I-- I just...

35:23.382 --> 35:25.079
I just wanted
not to be alone for a second.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.562
Me neither.
It's just how it is sometimes.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.391
It's not really up to us.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.570
Air pressure's
s-- stable-- high.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.398
There's no systems
threatening, so--

35:39.572 --> 35:42.270
Earl's made it clear,
you don't leave the tower.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.619
For good reason.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.404
Let me guess, is it you--

35:45.578 --> 35:47.188
you have a problem up there
you can't handle?

35:47.667 --> 35:50.322
No. No.
I-- I just wanted to say hello.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.022
Oh, that's nice, but...

35:56.545 --> 35:58.852
I don't know you, Kate.
We're not friends.

35:59.418 --> 36:02.464
There's a reason I'm up here.
I don't want company.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.383
- Look--
- Hm.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.564
Try my tea.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.093
You signed up for this, Kate.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.924
Keep my mountain safe.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.581
My mountain now, too.

36:39.458 --> 36:40.763
Talk to me about Reggie.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.989
Uh, Reggie?
He's, uh, got a chip.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.773
Lonely guy.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.166
Blames himself for
not being able to save his wife.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.690
How'd she die?

36:55.430 --> 36:57.824
<i>Cancer,</i>
<i>but before I got here.</i>

36:58.346 --> 36:59.565
<i>So, you never met her?</i>

37:01.349 --> 37:02.959
No, but I met
everyone she's ever met.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.048
And that woman sounds
like she's a sweetheart.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.007
But you don't know for sure
that she died of cancer?

37:07.181 --> 37:08.487
You just heard that?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.017
What's this about, Kate?
You okay?

37:17.887 --> 37:19.976
Yeah, he just lives close.
I don't know him.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.024
<i>Look, Kate,</i>
<i>I know it's not easy</i>

37:24.198 --> 37:25.852
<i>being up there alone</i>
<i>after what happened.</i>

37:26.026 --> 37:27.636
<i>But stick to the routine.</i>

37:27.810 --> 37:29.159
<i>Helped me</i>
<i>when I came back from Kabul.</i>

37:29.899 --> 37:31.510
<i>Reggie can be</i>
<i>unfriendly sometimes,</i>

37:31.684 --> 37:32.859
but he's harmless.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.556
You're safe, Kate.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.254
We'll talk in the morning, okay?
Over and out.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.440
Take this.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.051
Take this.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.753
Mike--

38:40.927 --> 38:42.320
<i>Mike...</i>

38:42.494 --> 38:43.930
She had a restraining order,

38:44.104 --> 38:45.279
I'm gonna need you
to calm down!

38:45.453 --> 38:47.455
- For the wrists.
- Hmm.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.896
The program won't tolerate
violence toward other--

39:18.356 --> 39:19.618
Come on! God.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.367
Katie, my lady.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.673
Come here, kiddo.

39:32.631 --> 39:33.893
I'll help
put your swimsuit on.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.819
Oh, no. No! Oh, God.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.229
Okay.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.674
Goddammit!

41:08.248 --> 41:09.510
Kate?

41:11.643 --> 41:12.905
Kate?

41:13.601 --> 41:16.604
Hey, hey.

41:16.778 --> 41:18.301
Okay.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.478
- You all right? Come on.
- Shit. Mm-hmm.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.697
Here you go.
Here you go, oh.

41:23.611 --> 41:24.917
Oh.

41:25.352 --> 41:27.180
- All right.
- I'm sorry.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.488
It's just my, um...

41:32.098 --> 41:34.492
my heater broke and I'm,
uh, tired of being cold,

41:34.666 --> 41:36.537
but I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing here, so...

41:38.539 --> 41:41.890
Oh, I'm, uh--
I'm sorry about last week.

41:42.891 --> 41:44.327
I was a real horse's ass.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.028
I have bad days
when I miss her like hell.

41:56.252 --> 41:57.993
Let's hit that stump, huh?

41:58.516 --> 42:00.126
Come on, uh,

42:00.300 --> 42:02.215
get the feel for it, uh...

42:03.999 --> 42:05.827
Uh...

42:06.915 --> 42:09.222
I think your mistake
is what a lot of people do,

42:09.396 --> 42:11.964
they muscle the stump

42:12.138 --> 42:14.749
and muscle it, but you're--
you're not letting the axe

42:14.923 --> 42:16.142
do its job.

42:16.316 --> 42:17.578
If you give it the chance...

42:18.623 --> 42:19.885
to get some...

42:21.626 --> 42:22.931
Ah.

42:23.105 --> 42:25.151
It has
its own power to it, huh?

42:25.325 --> 42:27.283
- Okay. Okay.
- Give it a try.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.198
Good, good.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.245
Yeah, op--
open your legs a bit.

42:32.811 --> 42:34.595
- A bit, just in case--
- Okay.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.510
- Like that?
- Good, straight back.

42:37.163 --> 42:39.121
- And up.
- Okay.

42:39.295 --> 42:40.558
And bring it down.

42:41.297 --> 42:43.256
Good, good.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.692
All right, let's, uh...

42:45.737 --> 42:48.217
get this up here--
whoa, whoa, hold on, just--

42:48.391 --> 42:49.958
Oh, sorry, yes.

42:50.132 --> 42:51.960
All right,
hold it right for the--

42:52.134 --> 42:53.701
aim for that tip
right there.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.311
- Okay?
- Okay.

42:55.485 --> 42:57.313
And line it up.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.279
- I did it!
- There you go!

43:06.453 --> 43:08.324
- Look at that, would ya?
- I did it!

43:10.239 --> 43:12.720
Whoa, wait a minute.

43:15.636 --> 43:17.116
Pack chased her off.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.382
- Is she dangerous?
- She's sick and hungry.

43:22.556 --> 43:24.079
Can't get
more dangerous than that.

43:24.253 --> 43:26.212
Get outta here.

43:26.386 --> 43:28.649
Go on. Go on. Get out.

43:30.129 --> 43:33.567
Wanna pick up
some repellant next trip, huh?

43:34.742 --> 43:36.048
Oh, I, um--

43:36.570 --> 43:38.267
- What?
- I dropped my keys in the pit.

43:38.441 --> 43:39.660
So, I'm stuck up here.

43:40.966 --> 43:44.012
- In the-- in the shitter?
- Yeah.

43:46.841 --> 43:50.105
Well, use my place
to dump your trash

43:50.279 --> 43:51.933
and the--
the house is stocked.

43:52.107 --> 43:54.719
- Plenty of food and water.
- Going somewhere?

43:54.893 --> 43:57.504
Uh, I'll be with my grandkids
down in Pendleton

43:57.678 --> 43:58.940
for a couple of months.

44:02.857 --> 44:05.164
Why? Are you okay?
Are you--

44:05.338 --> 44:07.688
Oh, yeah, no, that'll be--
that sounds really nice.

44:07.862 --> 44:10.038
Yeah. No, it will be.

44:13.041 --> 44:15.174
Hey, uh, you try my tea?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.045
I did.
It did the trick.

44:17.916 --> 44:19.265
Uh-huh, anytime.

44:19.439 --> 44:20.832
- That's what I do.
- Yeah.

44:25.619 --> 44:28.230
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>this is your pep talk video</i>

44:28.404 --> 44:30.319
<i>to remind you</i>
<i>that you are the shit.</i>

44:30.493 --> 44:32.060
<i>That you got this.</i>

44:32.234 --> 44:33.496
<i>That you are queen</i>
<i>of the mountain...</i>

44:33.671 --> 44:35.629
Fuck! No!

45:09.750 --> 45:11.839
Is the bar open?

45:12.013 --> 45:14.015
Hi. Yes. Come on in.

45:14.189 --> 45:16.409
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, thank you so much.

45:16.583 --> 45:20.239
Oh, look at this penthouse view.

45:20.413 --> 45:22.023
Oh, it's pretty beautiful.

45:22.197 --> 45:24.678
- Oh, man, I'm moving in.
- Please do.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.332
I haven't seen anyone
on the trail,

45:26.506 --> 45:28.029
and my neighbor's been gone
for two weeks.

45:28.203 --> 45:29.901
- I'm losing my mind up here.
- Oh, poor doll.

45:30.075 --> 45:31.990
I couldn't do this.
I mean, I like people too much.

45:32.164 --> 45:34.601
- I like to talk.
- That's music to my ears.

45:37.125 --> 45:39.345
Wait, they fell
in the shitter?

45:39.824 --> 45:42.783
Oh, I've had
much better luck in there.

45:42.957 --> 45:45.046
- It is a tight squeeze.
- Oh, yeah.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.918
I used to zip myself
all the way up

45:47.092 --> 45:48.484
in a sleeping bag
when I was a kid.

45:48.658 --> 45:50.225
So did I!
I did that, too.

45:50.704 --> 45:52.488
Yeah.

45:52.662 --> 45:54.447
Oh, man. All right.

45:55.448 --> 45:57.015
What's this?

45:57.189 --> 45:59.452
Okay, that's not as exciting
as you think.

45:59.626 --> 46:01.802
My neighbor
fancies himself a shaman.

46:01.976 --> 46:04.370
That's herbal tea.
For my nerves.

46:04.544 --> 46:07.808
ah, my husband...
...loves tea.

46:08.722 --> 46:10.942
Me, I prefer
a good old cup of coffee.

46:11.551 --> 46:13.727
- I'll make you some.
- Ah, thanks.

46:13.901 --> 46:15.120
How long
you two been married?

46:15.860 --> 46:18.079
Uh, we're not anymore.

46:19.167 --> 46:21.126
I got tired of his fists.

46:25.608 --> 46:28.046
Earl, I snapped some pics.

46:29.177 --> 46:30.831
Sent a violation report to ILD.

46:31.005 --> 46:33.051
Fire on that campsite
Kate found.

46:33.225 --> 46:34.748
When'd you go there?

46:34.922 --> 46:36.054
Well, you know,
you go when it happens,

46:36.228 --> 46:37.490
like they say.

46:38.970 --> 46:42.060
Could've been bad.
She definitely saved your ass.

46:46.455 --> 46:48.980
Fuck off, Dan.

47:37.071 --> 47:38.638
Oh, shit.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.775
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

47:47.734 --> 47:48.909
Oh, God.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.129
Okay.

47:54.654 --> 47:55.916
Okay.

48:07.275 --> 48:08.581
Come in dispatch,
this is Alpha Mount.

48:08.755 --> 48:10.322
Smoke spotted, over.

48:10.496 --> 48:12.193
<i>Copy, Alpha Mount. Landmark?</i>

48:12.367 --> 48:14.630
Halfway up Brush Ridge,
E slope.

48:14.804 --> 48:16.241
<i>Copy. reading?</i>

48:16.415 --> 48:20.506
Uh, 21 degrees plus 30,
angle it's-- sorry,

48:20.680 --> 48:23.422
uh, vertical angle
is 14 degrees,

48:23.596 --> 48:26.686
so, seven--
nope, seven and a half.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.557
<i>Copy.</i>
<i>Seven and a half miles.</i>

48:28.731 --> 48:30.255
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>the smoke base?</i>

48:30.733 --> 48:32.257
Negative.

48:32.431 --> 48:34.520
Plume gray,
moderate volume wind southwest

48:34.694 --> 48:36.174
at four miles per hour.

48:36.348 --> 48:37.958
<i>Copy. Last rain, Alpha?</i>

48:39.090 --> 48:41.222
Jesus Christ. Uh...

48:43.094 --> 48:45.487
- 37 days.
- <i>Copy that, Alpha.</i>

48:45.661 --> 48:48.403
<i>Fire number one</i>
<i>for Delta Brush Ridge.</i>

48:48.577 --> 48:50.188
Copy 14 Delta Brush Ridge.

48:51.058 --> 48:52.538
<i>Okay, thank you, Alpha.</i>

48:52.712 --> 48:54.801
<i>Alert sent. In transit.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

49:07.509 --> 49:08.771
Shit.

49:35.624 --> 49:36.930
Where are you guys?
Come on.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.242
Here we go.

50:02.129 --> 50:03.522
The fuck are you doing?

50:08.483 --> 50:10.094
Dispatch, can you suppress
with retardant?

50:10.268 --> 50:12.226
What's the perimeter?

50:12.400 --> 50:13.401
<i>Alpha Mount,</i>
<i>we have negative confirmation</i>

50:13.575 --> 50:14.533
<i>of these coordinates.</i>

50:14.707 --> 50:16.013
Are you crazy?

50:16.187 --> 50:17.753
I'm looking
at the smoke right now.

50:17.927 --> 50:19.103
<i>Negative confirmation, Alpha.</i>

50:19.277 --> 50:21.192
<i>No smoke, no fire. Over.</i>

50:21.366 --> 50:24.760
It's right fucking there.
You're right on top of it.

50:25.239 --> 50:26.719
Miss Riley,
this is deputy Weaver.

50:26.893 --> 50:28.590
You are on an open channel.

50:28.764 --> 50:30.331
<i>I'm switching over</i>
<i>to frequency 13 now.</i>

50:30.505 --> 50:32.377
<i>Thank you, dispatch.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

50:32.551 --> 50:34.422
<i>Copy.</i>
<i>Lucky little thing, huh?</i>

50:34.596 --> 50:36.076
<i>Roger that, Earl.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

50:36.250 --> 50:38.426
Earl, those coordinates
are right.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.168
I've been staring
at the same spot for 30 minutes.

50:41.342 --> 50:42.604
I--

50:48.436 --> 50:50.090
<i>Listen to me</i>
<i>very carefully, Kate.</i>

50:50.699 --> 50:52.310
<i>I will bring you up on charges.</i>

50:52.484 --> 50:54.747
Those are real people
in those planes.

50:54.921 --> 50:56.705
It is a risk
every time they go up,

50:56.879 --> 50:58.272
fire or no fire.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.145
There was smoke.
I swear there was smoke.

51:01.319 --> 51:03.277
These are families, Kate.

51:06.237 --> 51:07.542
Do you hear me?

51:08.195 --> 51:11.242
- They have families.
- I know, Earl, God damn it.

51:11.416 --> 51:12.678
You continue
to threaten the trust

51:12.852 --> 51:14.288
I have rebuilt in this town.

51:14.462 --> 51:16.856
There was smoke, Earl!
There was.

51:17.030 --> 51:19.554
<i>I can't fire you.</i>
<i>I got no one else.</i>

51:19.728 --> 51:21.861
From now on, Dan will be
taking over your reports.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.515
I'm filing a citation

51:23.689 --> 51:25.212
with ILD
and US Forest Service

51:25.386 --> 51:27.475
for your transgression,
so it's on record.

51:27.954 --> 51:30.348
Please, Earl. I just...

51:31.436 --> 51:32.741
I just made a mistake.

51:33.612 --> 51:36.136
No, Kate, I did.
Over and out.

51:42.403 --> 51:43.665
Fuck!

51:46.146 --> 51:47.321
Fuck.

51:49.715 --> 51:51.282
What is happening to me?

52:40.461 --> 52:41.984
Tell Earl
I don't need a sitter.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.595
Kate.

52:43.769 --> 52:45.901
I hear you.
He's on tilt.

52:46.075 --> 52:47.773
I-- look, I don't want to be
up here, either.

52:48.252 --> 52:49.601
So then don't be up here.

52:50.906 --> 52:52.386
He's my boss.

52:52.560 --> 52:53.909
I mean, I need this job,

52:54.083 --> 52:56.782
but trust me,
I'm with you, all right?

52:56.956 --> 52:58.610
There's a reason
he's all worked up.

52:58.784 --> 53:01.700
Now, you fucked up.
You know that, right?

53:01.874 --> 53:03.876
Yeah, and I also put out a fire
in my first week.

53:04.050 --> 53:05.486
- I saved his ass.
- I know.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.184
So did I.
He didn't even file a report.

53:07.358 --> 53:08.837
That's what I'm saying.
He's distraught.

53:09.011 --> 53:10.230
It's not about you.

53:11.362 --> 53:12.624
So what's his problem?

53:15.235 --> 53:17.585
Earl doesn't want
what happened to him

53:17.759 --> 53:19.021
to happen to you.

53:21.459 --> 53:23.374
Earl almost burned
this whole town down.

53:25.724 --> 53:28.814
His first year,
he's a lookout, just like you.

53:30.119 --> 53:32.470
Runs down into town
to see Corinne.

53:33.427 --> 53:34.907
He wasn't gone long.

53:35.081 --> 53:37.126
Just half an hour, tops.

53:37.301 --> 53:40.608
But he missed
that first curl of smoke

53:40.782 --> 53:42.044
and...

53:42.741 --> 53:44.003
It spreads fast.

53:44.873 --> 53:46.266
He came back up,

53:46.440 --> 53:48.007
but he didn't need
to be at 6300 feet

53:48.181 --> 53:50.531
to see
it was a crown fire.

53:50.705 --> 53:51.924
He called it in.

53:53.012 --> 53:54.622
But we missed the jump and...

53:55.536 --> 53:56.798
look.

53:59.279 --> 54:00.976
Almost took
the whole mountain.

54:01.586 --> 54:02.848
The whole town.

54:04.110 --> 54:05.590
And he lost his buddy,

54:07.418 --> 54:09.158
the pilot who went down there
in the drop.

54:10.464 --> 54:13.119
I guess if your wife's daddy
has a state seat

54:13.293 --> 54:15.164
in Boise, it all just...

54:16.340 --> 54:17.863
goes away.

54:21.214 --> 54:22.911
Truth is, you know...

54:23.869 --> 54:26.001
who knows if the fire
would have been any less costly

54:26.175 --> 54:28.177
if Earl had called it in.

54:28.352 --> 54:29.614
I mean...

54:31.964 --> 54:34.183
you can't contain
that kind of fury...

54:35.446 --> 54:36.708
once it starts.

54:42.017 --> 54:43.367
No, you can't.

55:22.319 --> 55:23.581
I've been beat up.

55:24.495 --> 55:25.757
More than once.

55:28.499 --> 55:30.718
I didn't know why you were
on this mountain cape,

55:30.892 --> 55:35.027
but I knew it had nothing to do
with lookouts or fires or...

55:36.594 --> 55:37.856
I'm sorry.

55:38.726 --> 55:39.945
Yeah.

55:41.076 --> 55:43.078
Lots of bruises and breaks
as a kid.

55:43.252 --> 55:45.429
I broke my wrists
deflecting blows.

55:47.474 --> 55:48.736
Sick of being broken.

55:50.129 --> 55:52.566
It's time to plant my feet
and land a punch.

55:54.829 --> 55:57.136
You should stay right here.
It's beautiful.

55:58.180 --> 55:59.486
Maybe I will.

56:00.226 --> 56:01.619
Tower's growing on me.

56:03.011 --> 56:04.317
Let me ask you something.

56:05.536 --> 56:07.668
What happens when
your neighbor's food runs out?

56:08.843 --> 56:10.105
You know how to shoot?

56:10.932 --> 56:12.369
You mean to hunt?

56:12.543 --> 56:14.893
I mean to not need
anyone for anything.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.463
You know, I, uh...

56:20.333 --> 56:21.508
hate guns.

56:21.682 --> 56:23.423
- Mike had guns.
- Yeah.

56:24.032 --> 56:26.295
You learn how to shoot,
you won't have to run anymore.

56:27.558 --> 56:28.907
They keep a rifle up there?

56:35.870 --> 56:38.743
My uncle exposed himself to me
in the pool house.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.354
Soon after, he started
crawling into bed with me.

56:41.833 --> 56:43.225
I was 12.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.706
He shot my dog
for peeing in his car.

56:46.359 --> 56:48.666
Just pulled over
and left him for the maggots.

56:51.233 --> 56:52.670
Wish I knew
how to shoot back then.

57:02.288 --> 57:03.681
God, I suck at this.

57:03.855 --> 57:05.334
Nah, you're scared
of the weapon

57:05.509 --> 57:07.206
because you're scared
of its power.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.164
Just surrender.

57:09.338 --> 57:10.731
Give in to its nature.

57:11.210 --> 57:13.560
You surrender to your nature,
you get your power.

57:13.734 --> 57:15.475
Same with the gun. Got it?

57:16.215 --> 57:17.651
Try again.

57:32.187 --> 57:34.276
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

57:41.109 --> 57:43.285
Yeah. Almost.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.157
Oh, you clipped it.

57:45.331 --> 57:46.854
Go, go, go, go, go.

57:50.815 --> 57:52.294
- Yes.
- I got it.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.994
- I did get it.
- Oh, my gosh.

58:10.399 --> 58:13.446
So, you say
your neighbor lives alone.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.187
Mm-hmm.

58:15.361 --> 58:18.538
- He doesn't have a lady?
- No, no way.

58:18.712 --> 58:20.975
All he talks about
is his dead wife, so,

58:21.149 --> 58:23.108
not exactly a turn on
for the ladies.

58:25.589 --> 58:26.851
Uh...

58:30.855 --> 58:33.510
- Where'd you get these?
- His bedroom.

58:34.946 --> 58:36.513
You didn't have
any of that tea, did you?

58:36.687 --> 58:37.949
Good.

58:38.123 --> 58:39.559
I don't know
about your nerves,

58:39.733 --> 58:41.692
but I bet
it would have relaxed your legs.

58:42.649 --> 58:44.651
- We gotta tell Earl.
- We?

58:45.391 --> 58:46.871
I shouldn't even be here.

58:47.045 --> 58:48.786
You know,
hanging with you,

58:48.960 --> 58:50.527
raiding the cabin of a guy
who's lived here 20 years,

58:50.701 --> 58:52.050
taking his rifle.

58:52.224 --> 58:55.227
No way.
You get fired, I get arrested.

58:55.401 --> 58:56.837
No, yeah, you're right.

58:57.011 --> 59:00.406
- I'll tell him.
- Nah. Don't be dense, Kate.

59:01.059 --> 59:02.321
He's in on it.

59:03.017 --> 59:04.758
Both him and Reggie.

59:04.932 --> 59:08.066
Come on, Bertha.
He's so by the books guy.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.371
There's no way
he doesn't say something.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.156
Makes no sense.

59:11.330 --> 59:13.245
It does if all he wants
is you out of that tower.

59:13.941 --> 59:15.421
It does
if he never wanted you there

59:15.595 --> 59:16.944
in the first place.

59:32.003 --> 59:34.745
Kate!

59:37.661 --> 59:38.923
Ow.

59:55.156 --> 59:58.464
Oh, was there
a party last night?

01:00:01.467 --> 01:00:03.774
Barometer's low. 29.

01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:07.429
Yeah, I mean, we'll probably
get strikes tonight.

01:00:08.039 --> 01:00:09.301
Be careful.

01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:11.651
And, oh, listen,

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.827
maybe you could just
tell Earl I came up,

01:00:14.001 --> 01:00:15.307
if he-- if he asked.

01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:17.265
I mean,
these-- these trips up here

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:18.658
are kicking my ass.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.226
I keep a secret.

01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:31.497
Okay. Thanks.

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:58.742
Ah, you got my note!

01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:00.613
Bertha,
you shouldn't be here.

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.484
Yeah. Well...

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.183
if he gets to
steal your underwear,

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:07.576
we get to drink his booze.

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.056
Hey.

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:12.669
Mm. Mm.

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:14.975
Codgers like him...

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:19.023
need to get cut down
like old growth.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.286
Yeah.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.119
- Bad things find me.
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:01:28.293 --> 01:01:31.252
That's something Kate says
to avoid power.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:32.776
Like the gun.

01:01:34.647 --> 01:01:35.953
Just say it.

01:01:36.562 --> 01:01:37.781
You'll feel better.

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:44.178
- I'm back.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.790

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.621
I'm his wife.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.449
He says it was cancer,
but he lies.

01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:40.234
He murdered me.
He's gonna kill you, too.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.846
He won't.

01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.980
Watch Earl
and anyone with him.

01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:49.287
Don't let him
take back that tower.

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.594

Fuck a duck.

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:39.511
From ISP.

01:03:39.685 --> 01:03:41.295
Those two kids from Wallace
have been missing over a month.

01:03:41.861 --> 01:03:43.776
Clearing out says they took
our trail to Raglan Peak.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.778
Let's go.

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:47.345
Yeah, but I mean, Kate's gonna
call in, like, 10 minutes.

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:49.434
Yeah, we'll be up there
after Reggie's.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.523
- Reggie?
- He's back today.

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.786
He's taking over for Kate.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.093
You're not gonna
get him out of the house.

01:03:56.267 --> 01:03:57.529
Yeah, that's why
you're coming.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.400
You're buddies,
he listens to you.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:01.315
Kate's fine, man.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.622
Her reports are on time.
They're accurate.

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.798
It's been seven weeks
since she fucked up.

01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:07.931
- She's good.
- No. She's a risk.

01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:09.933
She's coming down.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.543
You're not gonna lose
your job, man.

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:13.458
Relax. You know people.

01:04:14.981 --> 01:04:16.243
What was that?

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.855
What, you want me
to spell it out?

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:20.857
We all know
why you still have a job.

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.467
What-- hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:24.164
I'm just saying,
you fucked up, too, right?

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:25.992
You fucked up
and you got a second chance.

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.560
That's all I'm saying. Shit.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.524
She needs
to come off that mountain.

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.309
Not safe
keeping her up there.

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.311
<i>I'd have done it sooner</i>
<i>if I had someone.</i>

01:04:42.704 --> 01:04:43.967
Now I do.

01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.759
I told you.
Here they come.

01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:56.153
They're coming for your tower.

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:32.841
<i>Anybody here? Hello?</i>

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:36.149
<i>Nickie.</i>

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:41.067
Kate. Oh, wait, it's on.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:42.634
Hey. Kate. Yes. Hi.

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.288
- How are you?
- <i>I'm good.</i>

01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:46.420
I want to see you.

01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.118
How do I--
how do I get up there?

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.684
<i>There's a map on the wall.</i>

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:53.645
Yeah.

01:05:54.689 --> 01:05:55.777
<i>See you soon.</i>

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:08.616
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:10.705
I'm gonna,
uh, radio Charlie.

01:06:10.879 --> 01:06:12.142
Oh, fuck.

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.884
Come in, dispatch.
This is Dan.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.190
<i>Copy. Go ahead.</i>

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:19.105
The animals got at it after.

01:06:19.279 --> 01:06:20.454
...Charlie here,
we found on of the missing...

01:06:20.628 --> 01:06:22.065
Posterior entry.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.936
He was running.

01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:25.851
before the saddle
on Raglan trail.

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:27.374
Definitely
didn't see it coming.

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:29.986
He was ambushed.

01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:39.386
<i>Copy,</i>
<i>Point Five and North Saddle.</i>

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.258
<i>Any sign</i>
<i>of the other kid?</i>

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:43.521
No, I don't know, shit.
That's a good question.

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.305
I have no fucking clue.

01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:46.480
<i>10-4. We'll get SO down there.</i>

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:47.786
<i>Over and out.</i>

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.454
Someone broke in
and took Reggie's rifle.

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.196
If he was back,
we'd have heard from him by now.

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:09.199
I'll drop you there,
and then check on Kate.

01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.852
Yeah,
but where's that other kid?

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:13.290
Not here
and didn't go home.

01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:16.380
Maybe he's been out there
like an animal for a month?

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.121
You hit Reggie's again,

01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:19.731
he won't be black
on ammo either.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:22.081
Let's go.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:07:59.031
What the...

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:03.644
Hello?

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.944
Bunny's knife.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:45.991
Shit.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.104
Come on, now.

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:29.339
Oh!

01:09:31.384 --> 01:09:34.953
I don't touch your crap!

01:09:35.127 --> 01:09:37.694
God damn it.

01:09:37.868 --> 01:09:39.957
Jesus, mercy.

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:50.663
Somebody--

01:10:19.389 --> 01:10:21.478
No. Stop!

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:23.958
Stop! Please.

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.439
Please. No.

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.747
Please, no!

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:34.795
He's home. Hurry.

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:48.983
Reggie!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.553
Reggie!

01:10:58.428 --> 01:10:59.733
J-- Jesus.

01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:02.519
Reggie. Wh--

01:11:02.693 --> 01:11:03.998
- Hey, Danny.
- What--

01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:06.436
Danny,
someone's shooting at me.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.525
- Who? From where?
- I don't know.

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:10.178
- I don't know.
- Shit.

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:13.094
I don't know what--
they're toying with me.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.053
Be careful!

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:17.011
Oh, come on,
help me.

01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:19.231
We got a dead kid
in the clearing.

01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:21.015
And his crazy friend's
out there in the woods.

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:23.235
What? That's where
Bertha's buried.

01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.542
Enough of your bullshit,
Reggie.

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.935
I am not gonna
get shot out here.

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:31.548
Where's the latch on this thing?

01:11:31.722 --> 01:11:34.072
- I did all I could.
- Yes, you did.

01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:36.117
You don't know
what love is.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.468
You-- you condescending me?

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:40.296
Are you condescending me?

01:11:40.774 --> 01:11:42.776
- Help me out!
- You're hurting me.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.561
You're hurting my leg,
you're--

01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:45.997
Danny!

01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:07.453
Uh, Hey.

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:12.066
- What happened?
- Me happened.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:15.331
For Bertha.

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:23.382
For me.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.056
<i>Dan, do you copy?</i>

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.058
<i>Dan, do you copy?</i>

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:53.107
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please, no.

01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:55.719
Nickie!
What are you doing here?

01:12:58.896 --> 01:13:00.201
Dan, do you copy?

01:13:01.725 --> 01:13:02.987
Oh, shit.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:09.254
What is this crazy shit?

01:13:12.257 --> 01:13:13.563
Kate!

01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:16.392
Girl, you owe me,
big time.

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.576
No, no, no, no, no. No.

01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:30.667
Kate!
Kate, are you up there?

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.321
Hey.

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:35.498
Oh, my God.

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:39.023
Wha--

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.553
Fuck this shit.

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.033
I'm gonna go get help!

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:12.709
All right, girl,
You got this shit.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:34.426
Nick, it's not safe.
Go back!

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.906
We gotta help Kate.

01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.430
Nickie,
there is a shooter loose.

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:39.779
Go back to your car
right now.

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:42.434
Nickie!

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.305
There is a dead man
up on the toilet,

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.394
and somebody ate
his motherfucking foot.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.885
In here,
like they're hiding him.

01:14:59.973 --> 01:15:01.148
What is going on here?

01:15:22.039 --> 01:15:23.649
Earl, what is going on?

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:29.829
Earl, please,
what's going on?

01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:40.666
Dan, I need you
at the tower now.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.886
Where's Kate?

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.323
Motherfucker, answer me!

01:15:45.802 --> 01:15:47.760
I hear it.
I hear his walkie!

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:50.894
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan,
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

01:15:51.068 --> 01:15:54.462
<i>Dan, Dan, Dan,</i>
<i>Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.</i>

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:55.986
What the hell?

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.599
- Where is he?
- What the hell?

01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:03.080
When was the last time
you saw Kate?

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:05.082
A-- a while.
Nick, please.

01:16:05.865 --> 01:16:07.127
The fuck, Earl.

01:16:08.302 --> 01:16:09.826
Who's out there?

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.567
Kate!

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.047
Is she dead, Earl?

01:16:14.657 --> 01:16:15.919
Is she dead?

01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:19.879
She left, Nick.
She's safe.

01:16:21.228 --> 01:16:23.187
Where she-- hey!

01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:26.103
Jesus.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.462
Kate.

01:16:41.379 --> 01:16:43.120
Kate, I love you.
I love you.

01:16:44.295 --> 01:16:45.426
<i>Don't let them</i>

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.211
<i>take back that tower.</i>

01:16:47.385 --> 01:16:49.430
- Say something!
- Don't them get her.

01:16:50.562 --> 01:16:51.824
Say something!

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.132
Run.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:57.569
No! Kate, please!

01:16:57.743 --> 01:16:59.397
Kate!
I'm locking it up.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.051
I'm taking her away.

01:17:01.878 --> 01:17:03.270
Hey, no!

01:17:07.492 --> 01:17:08.754
Fuck.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:14.194
Shit. Fuck.

01:17:22.072 --> 01:17:23.421
Kate, no!

01:17:34.432 --> 01:17:38.436
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:17:42.048 --> 01:17:43.310
Earl!

01:17:46.574 --> 01:17:47.837
She's right under me.

01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.229
Can you see her?

01:17:51.188 --> 01:17:52.319
Yeah.

01:18:00.893 --> 01:18:02.678
Well, what's she's doing?

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:04.897
She-- she's just
sitting there.

01:18:13.558 --> 01:18:14.820
Shit.

01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:19.738
Earl!

01:18:19.912 --> 01:18:21.653
Fuck.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.002
Leave him alone, Kate!

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:30.836
Get out of there!

01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:48.724
- Get out of there!
- Shit.

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:07.873
Shit!

01:19:26.544 --> 01:19:28.198
God!

01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:37.860
Fuck.

01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:27.735
Nickie.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.476
Earl, let her go!

01:20:30.303 --> 01:20:31.522
Earl!

01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:38.964
Are you okay?

01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:40.836
I will do it!

01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:58.897
We're gonna
get you some help, Kate.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.422
- Are you okay?
- I'm gonna die.

01:21:02.596 --> 01:21:03.771
Well, then I guess,
you're staying up here.

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:05.295
- Oh, shit.
- Come on.

01:21:05.469 --> 01:21:07.863
I got you, I got you.

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.130
Okay.

01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:15.740
Just lock it.

01:21:20.658 --> 01:21:22.834
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:21:25.184 --> 01:21:27.186
- Sorry, Nickie.
- I got you.

01:21:43.202 --> 01:21:44.682
Got you, I got you.

01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:57.477
I got you,
I got you.

01:21:57.651 --> 01:21:59.697
- I'm so sorry, Nickie.
- It's okay.
