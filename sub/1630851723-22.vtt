00:02.903 --> 00:04.372
Red, we have to go.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.673
Not without Marvin.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.575
Right now, there's half
a dozen cops in here.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.144
In the next five minutes,
that number's gonna triple.

00:10.278 --> 00:10.978
Then we better find him.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.184
COOPER: (ON PHONE) Dembe,
any sign of Gerard?

00:16.317 --> 00:18.419
I'm sorry, Harold.
I think Marvin's gone.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.188
How'd he get out?
ARAM: Hang on.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.855
We may not know where he is,

00:21.989 --> 00:24.625
but I think we can figure out
where he is going.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.860
Check this out.
According to records,
three private jets

00:26.994 --> 00:29.797
were scheduled to depart
from that airport
over the next 90 minutes.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.299
What do we know
about the three?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.534
ARAM: Two corporate jets,
one for an insurance company,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.269
one for a hedge fund,

00:35.403 --> 00:39.473
and both of those make regular
trips to and from Culpeper.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.576
But this one is owned by some
kind of shell holding company

00:42.710 --> 00:43.877
based in the Philippines.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.779
It was scheduled to land
and depart

00:45.913 --> 00:47.581
all within 30 minutes
of Marvin's arrival.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.250
What's its scheduled
destination?

00:49.383 --> 00:51.685
Aerodromo Rizal, an airfield

00:51.819 --> 00:54.222
about 40 minutes
outside Camaguey, Cuba.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.890
DEMBE: (ON PHONE)
If that's Marvin's plane,
it's still here on the ground.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.393
Nothing was cleared
to take off
after the evacuation started.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.362
It's not, because
it never landed.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.397
That plane was still
on approach to Culpeper

01:03.531 --> 01:04.632
when the security alert
was called in.

01:04.765 --> 01:05.999
Air traffic control
waved it off.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.935
It was diverted?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.604
To another private airfield
30 miles north.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.905
Then that must be
where Marvin's heading.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.707
I'm leaving now.
Send me the location.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.343
Agent Ressler's
still in the area.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.044
I'll reach out to him
and have him meet you there.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.879
I don't know how it happened,

01:19.012 --> 01:22.550
but Fisker wasn't there
and Reddington was waiting!

01:22.683 --> 01:24.718
(SIGHS) Well, find out
where the hell he is.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.255
I'll be in Camaguey
by morning.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.290
I need us to be in the air
as soon as possible.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.524
Just leave the bottle.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.196
Mr. Gerard?
Can we wait
till we take off?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.231
Pilot just got word
that federal agents
entered the terminal.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.332
They must know
you're here.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.533
How do they know
we're here?

Agent Zuma is gonna
question you.

We need everyone off.

We'll wait at the gate

You didn't get to him
first, Harold.

I had him, and you
took him away from me.

I would have done the same
and probably will.

I know it's hard to accept,
but this is how it has to be.

Someone has to be held
accountable,

It's unacceptable.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.889
He is mine to deal with.

You'd really
rather kill him?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.159
Even if it means
I go to prison?

03:12.293 --> 03:15.363
I don't see either
of those outcomes
as being inevitable.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.130
But let's be clear,
Harold.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.334
You made your bed with
every crime you committed,

03:20.468 --> 03:21.869
with every day
you let pass

03:22.002 --> 03:23.804
without coming to me
for assistance,

03:23.937 --> 03:27.174
so now you have no right
to put me at grave risk

03:27.308 --> 03:29.443
because you acted
with reckless disregard.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.979
Disregard for what?
Disregard for what?

03:32.112 --> 03:35.148
That conversation could begin
and end with Agnes alone.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.184
Elizabeth entrusted you
with her daughter.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.419
You took her in.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.987
You promised to protect her.
That's right.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.655
Enough.
No, I want to say this.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.557
I can't defend my mistakes,
except for to say

03:43.691 --> 03:44.725
I committed them all
for one reason

03:45.526 --> 03:46.994
to stay out of prison,

03:47.127 --> 03:49.997
to somehow prevent that girl
from losing another parent.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.932
You've made a bigger mess
of this

03:52.065 --> 03:53.834
than either
of you realize.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.669
That man is my attorney.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.940
Do you have any idea
how clever a person

04:22.763 --> 04:24.665

to do this myself.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.967
Doesn't sound like
I'm in for questioning.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.604
It sounds like you intend
to gloat or vent.

04:30.738 --> 04:31.705
I'm not gloating, Marvin.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.707
To be honest, I'm bereft.

The loss of Elizabeth,
the brutality of it,

personal satisfaction

You tried to destroy me.

I'm not going

you will soon enough.

There's no deal coming,

tell us anything you know.

He can, but he won't.
You're a puppet.

sees 1%

organization,

05:05.005 --> 05:07.307
the 1%
he allows you to see.

05:07.441 --> 05:12.079
The rest, the full scope
of what we built together,

respectfully, don't have

You'll tell me all about it

05:23.591 --> 05:24.858
in exchange for less time
in a cell?

05:24.992 --> 05:26.760
I don't plan on telling you
anything, Harold,

05:27.795 --> 05:30.764
because you
are an underling.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.332
I'm not even talking to you
right now.

Yes, Harold. I do.

The fact that I took it
should be all the indication

06:07.768 --> 06:10.137
you need of just
how urgent this is.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.304
I spoke with my father.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.506
How is Alfred?

06:12.640 --> 06:13.974
He's alive, and in
a pretty good mood,

06:14.107 --> 06:16.309
considering his prostate's
the size of a grapefruit.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.678
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.547
Well, he's 83.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.981
You could have
killed him at 63,

06:21.114 --> 06:22.315
so he knows he's living
on borrowed time.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.517
I'm glad I didn't.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.018
Why didn't you?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.687
He never likes to talk
about your arrangement.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.021
Sounds like Alfred.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.957
God knows I've done
far worse to others

06:30.090 --> 06:31.725
for stealing a fraction

06:31.859 --> 06:33.727
of what he embezzled
from my organization.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.696
Why didn't I?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.031
You.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.734
When I found out that
he was only stealing

06:40.868 --> 06:43.370
so he could afford
to help his only child

06:43.504 --> 06:44.505
pay for law school --

06:44.638 --> 06:45.873
You saw an opportunity.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.408
Well, I don't know
about that.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.911
It's easy to be prophetic

06:51.044 --> 06:52.880
when you're older
and looking back.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.082
At the time, I just
liked your father

06:55.215 --> 06:57.851
and decided to call it
an investment in the future.

06:58.686 --> 06:59.687
My future.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.757
It's a strange feeling
knowing my legal education

07:03.891 --> 07:05.425
was paid for
by a criminal.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.360
It's not so bad, Carolyn.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.363
I may be a criminal,
but I'm also the most wanted.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.699
It's nice to be wanted.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.935
So this is it?
The payback?

07:16.336 --> 07:18.071
You're finally asking
for the favor

07:18.205 --> 07:20.373
my father promised you
in exchange for his life?

07:20.508 --> 07:22.943
Parenthood
is a remarkable thing.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.245
The selflessness of it.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.015
Your father risked
everything to help you,

07:28.148 --> 07:29.983
and I'm sure wanted
nothing in return.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.719
But I'm not your parent,
Carolyn.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.521
So, yes.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.388
It's time.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.193
Okay, Mr. Gerard.

07:41.729 --> 07:42.796
We all see
what's happening here.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.598
You went to war
with Reddington

07:44.732 --> 07:47.535
and you lost,
and now you're looking
to damage your enemy.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.904
Mm, not exactly.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.773
You're a senator, Cynthia.
Think bigger.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.644
No?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.279
I'm not interested in
damaging Raymond Reddington.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.750
I'm interested
in replacing him.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.918
You want
to say that again?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.855
MARVIN: Come on.
We all know that

08:07.988 --> 08:10.223
this arrangement
you made with Raymond

08:10.357 --> 08:13.093
is a lot more than
the government bargained for.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.929
He's uncontrollable.
He continues to commit crimes.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.398
The task force is,
frankly, off the rails.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.400
Is that so?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.636
Are you kidding me?
The assistant director
of the FBI

08:22.770 --> 08:24.938
is responsible
for half a dozen felonies.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.474
Yes, because you targeted
and blackmailed him.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.710
No. I mean, yes,
I did do that,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.112
but Harold
always had a choice.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.513
He didn't have
to break the law.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.349
He could have refused,
but he didn't. Why?

08:36.483 --> 08:38.451
Because Harold
is the way he is

08:38.586 --> 08:40.821
after all these years
of working with Raymond.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.255
Oh, that's rich.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.626
I'm offering you
and your bosses

08:45.759 --> 08:47.527
the chance to start over.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
I'm the man
behind the curtain, Cynthia.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.466
I run Reddington's
organization,

08:53.601 --> 08:56.469
which is why I can deliver
the same end product.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.139
I can maintain
the blacklist.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.875
I have access
to the same intel

09:02.009 --> 09:04.277
and can be a far more
reliable partner

09:04.411 --> 09:07.514
to the Justice Department
than Reddington ever was.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.584
You murdered Agent Keen,
framed Harold,

09:10.718 --> 09:13.120
and now you want
to use the chaos you created

09:13.253 --> 09:14.888
as proof
that we need a change?

09:15.656 --> 09:16.523
I'm the better option.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.858
That's not clever.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.793
It's insidious.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.395
Is it? My offer is simple.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.264
He's out.
I'm in.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.566
I get his deal,
and in exchange,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.736
I continue to provide
Main Justice

09:28.869 --> 09:30.537
with a steady stream
of criminals

09:30.671 --> 09:32.005
you don't even know exist.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.643
And what happens
to Reddington?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.377
That's the best part.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.580
Main Justice gets what
it always wanted, arrest him.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.916
Drop him
in a hole somewhere.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.018
This task force
will never work with you.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.021
That's true.
That's why we've got
to get rid of them, too.

09:48.155 --> 09:52.726
We start a new task force,
the Marvin Gerard task force.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.129
You honestly think
the Attorney General
will go for that?

09:56.263 --> 09:59.266
I do, and if we hurry up,
we might even be able

09:59.399 --> 10:01.034
to get this thing
up and running
by the end of the week.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.576
COOPER: Main Justice
has Marvin in lockdown.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.980
Instead of a detention center,
they sent him to the Cooler

10:13.113 --> 10:15.415
while he waits
on the Attorney General
to decide on his offer.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.884
The Cooler?
That's inmate talk

10:17.017 --> 10:19.086
for Calvin Coolidge
Correctional Facility.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.855
He's being closely guarded.
He's only allowed in his cell
or the prison library.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.857
Because he's
representing himself?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.125
It's a nightmare scenario.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.593
COOPER:
It may get even darker.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.229
If Marvin's offer is accepted,
Raymond will be arrested.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.764
What happens to us?

10:30.898 --> 10:33.433
I don't know. I assumed
you'd all be reassigned.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.635
If I'm not being prosecuted,
maybe they'll let me retire.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.204
What do you mean, if you're
not being prosecuted?

10:37.337 --> 10:39.472
We did what they wanted.
We arrested Marvin.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.908
That was never a guarantee.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.642
RESSLER: The irony is,
now that we've found him,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.778
we have to protect Marvin
against Reddington.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.246
COOPER:
One of us is going to prison.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.682
If Raymond kills Marvin,
I don't like my chances.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.819
I can keep an eye on Raymond,
see what he's planning.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.286
Great. I'll go with you.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.288
Alina.
You can't be in the field.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.656
And I won't be.
I'll be in the car.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.292
Come on, now I can't even
do surveillance?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.328
What's the latest?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.430
I'll be seeing
a top neurologist
in D.C. later today.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.832
If he clears me, I'm back.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.901
If not, this could be
my last assignment.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.105
Okay. But stay in the car.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.875
****

11:21.348 --> 11:22.615
He's just sitting there.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.683
How long ago did he leave?

11:23.817 --> 11:25.152
DEMBE: Ten minutes.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.487
He left the warehouse
and drove straight here.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.389
He's less than half a mile
from where Marvin's
being held.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.124
That is probably
not a coincidence.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.494
Hang on. There's
another car approaching.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.964
****

11:38.999 --> 11:40.000
What's happening?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.501
Reddington's talking
to the driver.

11:44.004 --> 11:44.872
I don't recognize him.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.139
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

11:48.075 --> 11:50.177
I'm sending you photos to run
for facial recognition.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
DEMBE: He obviously knows
who Raymond is.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.716
Wait a minute. Reddington's
handing him something.

11:58.085 --> 11:58.819
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

11:59.787 --> 12:00.988
It's cash.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.956
For what?
ARAM: Okay, I got the photos.

12:03.090 --> 12:03.824
All right, I'm running
his image

12:03.957 --> 12:05.392
through bureau databases now.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.729
There he is. A Lieutenant
Theodore Heneveld.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.332
He's a guard at the Coolidge
Correctional Facility.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.235
Unbelievable. Reddington
really is gonna kill Marvin.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.636
Do you want us to move in?

12:16.770 --> 12:18.371
ARAM: Negative. You're staying
in the car, remember?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.739
Actually, both of you,
get back here now.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.075
So now what?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.276
I think Marvin's
in serious danger.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.611
ARAM: Get out to Coolidge,

12:24.744 --> 12:25.979
and when Heneveld shows up
for work, arrest him.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.180
Bring him in for questioning.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.183
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

12:35.889 --> 12:38.191
****

12:43.463 --> 12:44.197
Can I help you?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.034
Are you him?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.602
I'm gonna need a little more
context for that question.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.740
The others say
you're Marvin Gerard,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.209
Mr. Raymond Reddington's
personal attorney.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.211
I know Raymond.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.047
And you are?

13:01.248 --> 13:02.482
He knows me
by the name Wujing.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.918
You're Wujing?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.922
The most prolific assassin
who ever worked

13:09.056 --> 13:10.924
for the Chinese state
security service?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.827
May I sit?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.929
You've murdered more American
operatives than I can name.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.330
What am I gonna say,
no?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.431
(CHUCKLES)

13:21.835 --> 13:23.103
Why are you here?

13:23.236 --> 13:24.637
I'm not gonna be here
very long.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.976
How about we just keep this
about you?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.211
Well, I'm serving
a life sentence

13:31.344 --> 13:33.413
with no chance of parole.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.549
My only hope of seeing
my kin and my country again

13:36.683 --> 13:39.619
is to escape this...
place.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.654
Yeah, well.
Good luck with that.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.323
I don't need luck.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.292
After years of planning,
I'm finally close.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.797
We have succeeded in placing
someone on the inside,

13:50.931 --> 13:53.967
on the transport team
at the Bureau of Prisons.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.203
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite catch that.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.272
The next time I'm taken
to the courthouse,

13:59.406 --> 14:03.210
this inside man will be
waiting to set me free.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.778
And you're telling me this
because?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.114
You are a lawyer.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.748
Not just a lawyer,
Reddington's lawyer.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.851
That means you must be
brilliant.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.286
And you are brilliant, yes?

14:14.121 --> 14:15.322
Yes.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.125
Well, my lawyers have tried
and have been unable

14:18.258 --> 14:21.294
to secure for me
a trip to the courthouse.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.464
They have filed motions
and each one has been denied.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.633
All I need is a reason
for the judge

14:26.766 --> 14:29.169
to grant me
some form of hearing.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.408
Ineffective assistance
of counsel.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.677
Your lawyers have tried
everything except

14:37.810 --> 14:40.880
for the one motion that means
they're terrible lawyers.

14:41.014 --> 14:44.751
If you claim that your own
lawyers are incompetent,

14:44.884 --> 14:48.721
I'll be you dollars to donuts,
you'll get your hearing.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.026
So, you are
Marvin Gerard.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.628
You're damn right I am.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.536
That look tells me
you have news.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.305
Good or bad?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.839
Only kind you get
around here, Harold.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.041
Good and bad.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.342
I can guess the bad.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.245
The Attorney General wants
to take Marvin up

15:12.379 --> 15:13.913
on his offer
to replace Reddington.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.082
You don't seem surprised.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.350
On the contrary,
I'm stunned.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.652
Every time I think
I know how stupid
Main Justice can be,

15:19.786 --> 15:20.720
I discover
there's a new low.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.555
The AG's not stupid,
Harold.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.157
He's embarrassed.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.059
Not too many people
know about our deal
with Reddington,

15:26.193 --> 15:28.661
but of those who do,
there are plenty who think

15:28.795 --> 15:31.931
it's beneath our government's
integrity to partner

15:32.065 --> 15:33.566
with a criminal
of his stature.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.269
I've heard those arguments.
They're theoretical.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.572
Those people
don't experience the reality
of our association.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.342
No, what they experience
are classified briefings

15:42.475 --> 15:44.544
about the crimes
he still commits,

15:44.677 --> 15:46.146
briefings about the death
of Agent Keen

15:46.279 --> 15:47.447
and the felonies
being committed

15:47.580 --> 15:50.117
by the Assistant Director
of the FBI.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.752
No, they don't get a sense
of the full reality,

15:52.885 --> 15:55.288
but what they do see
makes them want to cringe.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.358
Reddington's out.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.093
Arrest warrant's
been issued.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.961
The AG expects you
to take him into custody

16:02.095 --> 16:03.396
next time
he's in your company.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.367
And us?
You're out, too.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.402
There's a new task force
being sourced as we speak.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.405
You said
you had good news?

16:14.107 --> 16:18.478
Well, then I undersold,
because it's not good.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.412
It's great.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.650
Main Justice has agreed
not to charge you.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.986
On which counts?
All of them.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.389
It worked, Harold.
They're happy.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.258
They feel smart
and in control.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.360
Congratulations.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.162
The moment Marvin's deal
takes effect,

16:35.295 --> 16:36.629
their promise to you
becomes binding.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.239
ALINA:
What'd you do today

16:46.373 --> 16:48.641
before your shift stared,
Mr. Heneveld?
Nothing.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.178
A secret meeting
with the most wanted man
in the world?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.613
A jury might consider
that something.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.215
DEMBE: Your career is over,
lieutenant.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.617
The only question now
is whether your colleagues
at work

16:57.750 --> 16:59.386
will end up guarding you.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.221
Hope you were good
to the inmates.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.090
Save the heavy hand
for the next guy.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.158
I'm not making this any harder
than it needs to be.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.459
What was the meeting
about?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.827
I'll tell you,
but you won't believe me.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.063
Try us.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.299
He wants to break
into the Cooler.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.800
Apparently, his lawyer's
being held there,

17:13.933 --> 17:15.335
and he wants to meet
with him off the record.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.903
Why'd he come to you?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.872
Because he knows
I move contraband
in and out of there.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.175
One of the inmates,
Flody Pascal,

17:22.309 --> 17:24.611
his cousin's high up
in the Quito cartel.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.213
They built a passageway
from the outside

17:26.346 --> 17:27.814
so they could
send him things.

17:27.947 --> 17:30.317
A passageway?
You mean a tunnel?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.252
I don't know.
There's a vent
behind the boiler

17:32.385 --> 17:33.853
in one
of the sub-basements.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.655
They leave stuff
behind the grate.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.690
I get it and distribute it,
no questions asked.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.459
The passageway has to be
big enough

17:39.592 --> 17:40.860
for a person
to pass through.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.062
Reddington knows
the access point.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.098
I'm supposed to be
waiting at the grate
to let him in.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.667
You were right.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.302
Reddington won't stop
until Marvin's dead.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.138
Can you imagine
the hubris

17:51.271 --> 17:54.207
to break into a federal prison
and murder an inmate?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.675
We'll get Gerard
out of there.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.043
We have to transport him
to the courthouse

17:57.177 --> 17:59.212
so a judge can sign off
on his immunity deal.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.547
In the meantime,
Agent Zuma and I

18:00.680 --> 18:02.014
will make sure
that tunnel's shut down.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.750
Raymond's not getting
into that prison.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.554
****

18:12.992 --> 18:15.295
I almost destroyed my career
a thousand times in this job.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.797
I figured I'd finally do it

18:17.930 --> 18:20.400
when I came face to face
with whoever really
killed Elizabeth Keen.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.070
I honestly think I'd do it
if I were the only one

18:24.204 --> 18:26.573
who'd pay the price.
You'd kill me?

18:26.706 --> 18:29.809
Probably.
But then Cooper would end up
going to jail

18:29.942 --> 18:32.945
and Agnes Keen would lose
another parent.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.248
It makes me sick,

18:35.382 --> 18:36.749
knowing that you're gonna
get what you want.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.186
What I want?

18:39.319 --> 18:41.053
You think
this is what I want?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.955
I didn't beat Reddington.
We both lost.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.592
I would have worked for him
till the end.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.628
Now I'm an informant.

18:50.397 --> 18:54.100
Well, at least I am until
Raymond exacts his revenge.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.535
He's trying.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.969

in your voice, Raymond?
Sadness?

24:29.135 --> 24:29.902
In part.

For what it's worth, Marvin,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.474
I understand
your turn of events.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.777
The betrayal is unforgivable
and you'll die for it,

24:37.910 --> 24:40.813
but it's understandable.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.849
After all, my feelings
for Elizabeth

24:42.982 --> 24:44.817
weren't always rational.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.020
I was often emotional
rather than pragmatic,

24:48.154 --> 24:50.322
and you weren't
entirely wrong to wonder

24:50.456 --> 24:54.894
if Elizabeth was capable
or worthy of running things.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.764
Not entirely wrong,
or even slightly.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.836
Still, however subjective
my decision was,

25:03.970 --> 25:06.839
the objective truth
is that it was mine to make.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.241
You voiced your objections.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.110
You'd already made up
your mind.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.112
And once
the choice was made,

25:13.245 --> 25:16.549
it was your obligation
to live with it, Marvin.

25:16.683 --> 25:20.953
Even if it meant watching
everything we built crumble
before my eyes?

25:21.754 --> 25:22.755
Yes.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.757
No.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.125
I wasn't your servant,
Raymond.

25:27.059 --> 25:27.960
I was your partner.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.863
We created
an empire together.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.800
I may have been
in the shadows,

25:33.933 --> 25:35.201
but it was
my life's work, too.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.338
You had no right to have
been so reckless with it

25:40.439 --> 25:42.809
and blindly
expect my loyalty.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.144
I loved you, Marvin,

25:46.846 --> 25:48.347
but we were
never partners.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.150
You worked for me.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.720
I valued you.
I pulled you close.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.956
I wanted and needed your help
and friendship.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.458
I never dreamed that
it would cost me Elizabeth.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.762
You never dreamed

26:02.895 --> 26:04.997
that I would have the courage
to defy you.

26:07.299 --> 26:11.403
I wonder how many cowards
have gone to their graves

26:11.537 --> 26:13.172

on their own courage.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.341
You think I'm a coward?

26:15.474 --> 26:17.543
Marvin, if you wanted
Elizabeth dead,

26:17.677 --> 26:20.747
you could have
done it yourself
in a thousand dignified ways.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.914
Instead,
you used Vandyke.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.549
You let him shoot her
down in the street

26:23.683 --> 26:25.251
to hide your involvement.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.386
You targeted Harold
because you were afraid

26:27.519 --> 26:30.589
the task force would help me
discover what you'd done.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.391
I was brave enough to go
to war with you.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.026
Only because you had
nowhere left to run.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.531
Creating the specter
of Kate Kaplan.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.669
Those were acts
of cowardice, Marvin.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.538
The Department of Justice
may hope otherwise,

26:46.673 --> 26:47.940
but you are not me.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.710
You can't hide from me.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.112
You can't best me,

31:08.334 --> 31:09.468
Wait!

31:11.603 --> 31:13.239
Why are you
telling me this?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.706
I thought
you worked for him.

31:15.707 --> 31:16.842
He thought that, too.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.311
****

31:24.183 --> 31:27.653
I understand congratulations
are in order, Harold.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.656
So it seems.
Thank you for coming, Raymond.

31:30.789 --> 31:31.690
Have a seat.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.161
Agnes is asleep.
She'll be sorry
she missed you.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.696
****

31:43.169 --> 31:46.705
Marvin's deal went into effect
a little while ago,

31:46.838 --> 31:49.241
as did the promise
for Main Justice
not to prosecute me.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.343
It worked, Raymond.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.346
Bringing him in
brought me my life back.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.084
And yet you seem troubled.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.519
I am, because
the devil's bargain

32:00.652 --> 32:01.787
came with a hefty price.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.624
Marvin's freedom.
And your arrest.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.226
I was ordered
to place you in custody

32:07.359 --> 32:08.360
the next time I saw you.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.330
I see.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.831
You're here because I have
no intention of doing that.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.368
Apparently I have one crime
left to commit.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.404
Letting me go?

32:18.537 --> 32:19.871
That's very sweet of you,
Harold.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.774
I appreciate the warning,

32:22.908 --> 32:25.511
though I'm certain
it's unnecessary.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.214
It's true, Marvin's deal
did take effect.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.881
I had to make sure
of that,

32:31.717 --> 32:34.153
but he won't be cooperating
with the government.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.487
COOPER: I don't understand.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.788
RAYMOND: No, I don't suppose
you do.

32:38.224 --> 32:40.626
Marvin and I said
our goodbyes today.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.395
You spoke
with Marvin today?

32:44.663 --> 32:45.797
How is that
even possible?

32:47.433 --> 32:48.667
MARVIN: Then do it.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.002
I've had enough.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.305
You're right.

32:54.706 --> 32:55.607
I can't beat you,

32:56.875 --> 32:58.410
and I never really
wanted to try.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.312
It'll be done, Marvin,

33:00.446 --> 33:01.680
but I won't be the one
to do it.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.183
Out of respect
for our history,

33:04.316 --> 33:07.186
I'm going to give you what
you never gave Elizabeth,

33:07.319 --> 33:10.822
a chance to leave this world
in whatever way you choose,

33:10.956 --> 33:14.226
a chance to make it painless,
to put your affairs in order

33:14.360 --> 33:16.428
and say goodbye to those
who would grieve your passing.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.765
And if I refuse?

33:19.898 --> 33:21.967
Then you and I would get
the answer to a question

33:22.101 --> 33:24.103
I've been asking myself
since the night

33:24.236 --> 33:25.604
Elizabeth died,

33:25.737 --> 33:28.174
what will I do
to the person responsible?

33:28.307 --> 33:30.176
How dark is the blackness

33:30.309 --> 33:32.344
at the center of this hole
in my heart?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.048
I'm not sure I really want
to know that, Marvin,

33:37.483 --> 33:40.252
but if need be,
we'll find out together.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.156
You may not pull
the trigger, Raymond,

33:45.791 --> 33:48.660
but if I die,
it's because you killed me.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.499
I devoted everything to you,
to your vision,

33:54.800 --> 33:56.302
to what I thought
was our vision.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.538
A life of crime
with a common purpose,

34:00.772 --> 34:03.008
to help keep the world

34:03.142 --> 34:05.977
from slipping
into the kind of evil

34:06.112 --> 34:08.380
we know humans
are capable of.

34:10.916 --> 34:12.851
I thought we were
together in this.

34:12.984 --> 34:13.985
We were.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.522
No, Raymond,
because to me,

34:16.655 --> 34:18.490
it was the most
important thing,

34:19.325 --> 34:21.493
but to you, it wasn't.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.098
I am so proud
of what we built, Raymond.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.500
It's what I lived for.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.338
But in the end,

34:32.471 --> 34:37.343
I realize it was never
really my life at all.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.212
(GUNSHOT)

34:41.147 --> 34:43.014
****

34:45.016 --> 34:46.185
(DOOR OPENS)

34:46.318 --> 34:47.519
Cynthia? Come in.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.289
What's wrong?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.424
Are you all right?

34:52.558 --> 34:53.792
Why do I have a feeling
you already know

34:53.925 --> 34:54.893
what I'm about to say?

34:55.394 --> 34:56.528
Say it anyway.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.266
Marvin Gerard
won't be cooperating

35:00.399 --> 35:01.700
with the Justice Department.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.369
And why is that?

35:03.502 --> 35:05.437
Because I just heard
he left prison,

35:05.571 --> 35:07.539
got into his car,
and shot himself.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.277
My God, he's dead?

35:11.410 --> 35:12.511
I spoke
to the Attorney General.

35:12.644 --> 35:14.045
The promise stands.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.547
He won't punish you

35:15.681 --> 35:17.349
because Marvin did something
out of your control.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.084
I'm sure there's more.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.719
There is.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.054
He's rescinded his order
to have you arrested.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.924
Mm.
Surprise, surprise.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.759
He's just being practical.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.461
He doesn't like it,
but he knows
we need the blacklist,

35:29.595 --> 35:30.996
and if Marvin
can't deliver it,

35:31.930 --> 35:33.565
he's willing
to stay the course.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.067
Like none of this
ever happened?

35:36.202 --> 35:37.369
None of what, Harold?

35:38.103 --> 35:39.070
I've already forgotten.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.441
You really are
quite something.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.744
At the moment,
what I am is tired.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.216
I'm going away for a few weeks
to take the sisters home,

35:51.082 --> 35:52.218
eat some peyote,

35:52.351 --> 35:54.520
set up the telescope,
look at the night sky.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.356
Who knows, maybe
I'll find a new star

35:57.489 --> 35:58.790
to name after you,
Harold.

35:58.924 --> 35:59.658
I'll let you know.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.695
Please give my love
to Agnes.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.497
Don't forget what
tomorrow is, Raymond.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.000
Harold, I'll never forget
what tomorrow is.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.604
****

36:28.620 --> 36:29.621
Okay.

36:30.856 --> 36:31.790
Here goes.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.495
It's been three years
since we lost Elizabeth.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.932
In some ways,
it's gotten easier,

36:41.066 --> 36:45.136
but in most ways,
it still hurts.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.942
There goes my hope of doing
this without crying.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.680
And, uh, this part
won't be any easier.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.419
After a lot
of careful reflection...

37:02.053 --> 37:05.657
...I have decided
to take some time away.

37:07.192 --> 37:11.697
I do not know how long,
but I do know away.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.500
So what's your plan?

37:15.301 --> 37:16.668
My plan is no plan.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.171
I found a cool place
in Brooklyn,

37:20.306 --> 37:22.574
and I plan to go up there
and just, you know,
ride my bike,

37:22.708 --> 37:25.176
do New York,
eat lots of pizza,

37:25.311 --> 37:28.013
look at the people,
maybe a Broadway show.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.449
Anyway, I know we are here
to talk about Elizabeth,

37:30.582 --> 37:33.084
but I've been wanting
to tell you guys.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.588
I think
she'd like that idea.

37:40.191 --> 37:42.861
I remember when I saw
she was a profiler

37:42.994 --> 37:45.564
and I asked her
to profile herself.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.999
What did she say?

37:48.133 --> 37:51.069
She described someone similar
and yet

37:53.238 --> 37:56.575
so, so different
from the woman
I grew to know and love.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.078
I didn't like her.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.481
I mean, I came around,

38:05.351 --> 38:06.552
but she really got to me.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.656
COOPER: Alina, you made it.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.891
How'd it go
with the Bureau neurologist?

38:13.024 --> 38:15.226
Well, not like I expected.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.729
Apparently, my headaches
have been getting worse

38:17.863 --> 38:19.898
because of a pretty serious
medical condition.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.434
I'm pregnant.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.535
Oh!
Oh, my God!

38:23.669 --> 38:24.903
Congratulations!

38:26.772 --> 38:27.739
Pete must be
over the moon.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.509
So the headaches
aren't permanent?

38:30.642 --> 38:32.778
They don't know,
but they don't think so.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.113
Still, if it's okay, I'd like
to take a medical leave

38:35.246 --> 38:37.583
from the task force
until we know for sure.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.950
You'll be back in the field
before you know it.

38:39.751 --> 38:40.919
Maybe.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.754
Or maybe
life's got other plans.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.057
Once the baby's born,
either way,

38:46.625 --> 38:47.626
I'll be great.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.062
Dembe?
I think you're up.

38:51.196 --> 38:51.963
Would you care
to say anything?

38:53.799 --> 38:55.133
It was a little different
for me,

38:55.266 --> 38:58.136
because my relationship
with Elizabeth

38:58.269 --> 38:59.771
was always in terms
of Raymond.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.142
I remember when Elizabeth was
several years younger

39:04.275 --> 39:06.177
than Agnes is now.

39:06.311 --> 39:09.280
Raymond and I went to a soccer
match she was playing in.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.016
The match was a disaster.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.386
All these girls
running this way and that.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.156
A lot of missed goals
or goals made by accident,

39:18.289 --> 39:21.660
but it was so much fun.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.963
And after it was over,

39:25.096 --> 39:28.834
I don't think anyone really
cared or knew who won or lost.

39:28.967 --> 39:33.004
Everyone was standing around,
having snacks and juices,

39:33.138 --> 39:35.707
comparing scrapes and bruises,

39:35.841 --> 39:37.543
and there was a lot
of noise and activity,

39:37.676 --> 39:40.679
but suddenly,
I heard this laugh.

39:42.648 --> 39:46.985
This sort of explosive,
spontaneous laugh,

39:47.118 --> 39:51.222
young and so full of joy
and infectious,

39:51.356 --> 39:53.291
but also familiar.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.127
It was Elizabeth.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.165
But I turned to look
next to me,

40:00.298 --> 40:04.202
because just for a second,
I thought it was Raymond.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.538
(CHUCKLES)

40:08.507 --> 40:12.377
And some years later,
just before Elizabeth died,

40:12.511 --> 40:17.215
we all spent
a few days together
in D.C. and New York --

40:17.348 --> 40:21.086
Raymond, Elizabeth, Agnes,
myself, and Mrs. French,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.856
just hanging around, talking,

40:24.990 --> 40:28.494
eating, playing board games,
walking in the park.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.429
We went
to a couple of museums,
got ice cream,

40:31.563 --> 40:34.065
and we just laughed
with each other.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.437
Agnes, Elizabeth,
and Raymond.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.875
This funny, little family
who all share that laugh.

40:45.777 --> 40:50.081

mischievous,

wanting, tragic heart.
