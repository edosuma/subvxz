On the last episode
of <i> Ink Master,</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:07.757
13 masters and apprentices
were battling it out

00:07.841 --> 00:10.760
to prove they're the best.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.721
I think me and Chris are
definitely the top two,

00:12.804 --> 00:14.264
{\an1}and anybody else
that wants to step up

00:14.347 --> 00:16.099
{\an1}should make
their selves known.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.767
(announcer)
In the flash challenge,

00:17.851 --> 00:21.938
St. Marq's ego
infuriated his competitors.

00:22.021 --> 00:25.316
He sure is arrogant for somebody
who's not been in the top.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.777
Maybe St. Marq wants everybody
to hate him.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.570
Am I better than you?

00:28.653 --> 00:30.947
Oh, my God, yes.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.115
I hope you and I
go head-to-head.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.116

In the elimination tattoo,

00:37.912 --> 00:41.458
Chris had the power
and a serious strategy.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.585
Once the black-and-gray
specialists are gone,

00:43.668 --> 00:45.587
I have a clear path
to the finale.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.006
I want a colorful cold fish.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.259

I can't do color tattoos.

Bull[bleep].

00:55.388 --> 00:57.640
I'm gonna crush it.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.601
{\an1}This is BS right now.
Like, I'm [bleep] pissed.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.811
This bitch is crazy.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.480
I don't know how to handle
this [bleep].

01:03.563 --> 01:06.483
It looks like pee,
like the fish is peeing.

01:11.571 --> 01:15.575
Kito, Big Ceeze, Marisa,

01:15.658 --> 01:17.327
were the bottom four.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.453
You messed up my back,

01:18.536 --> 01:19.496
and you can't take
full responsibility

01:19.579 --> 01:21.873
for that ugly tattoo.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.167

Everything is so stiff
and rigid.

01:29.672 --> 01:33.468
The hollow feeling of a soulful
tattoo is the biggest letdown.

the way I always tattoo.

It's a bit
of a cop-out, man.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.357
This is permanent.

Kito, you do not have what it
takes to be Ink Master.

to tattooing,

The weakest link on our team

{\an8}But Erik and Marisa are
apprentice and master,

07:36.455 --> 07:39.667
{\an8}so they probably tattoo
in similar styles.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.253
I think this is gonna be
a good thing.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.421

which artist tattoos
which body part.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.319
Today, the most difficult part

08:06.402 --> 08:07.361
about this challenge
is consistency.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.363
{\an8}Our goal is that you leave here

08:09.447 --> 08:11.157
{\an8}with something that
looks awesome.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.242
{\an8}It's important that all
of these outlines and stencils

08:13.326 --> 08:16.078
{\an8}match up and play well together

08:16.162 --> 08:18.080
{\an8}so that this canvas transforms

08:18.164 --> 08:20.583
{\an8}into one particular pattern
throughout.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.251
{\an8}Lucky for you, I breed snakes.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.252
{\an8}- Ooh, really?
- Yeah.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.213
{\an8}Our strategy is to keep it true

08:25.296 --> 08:26.756
{\an8}to the anatomy
of an actual snake.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.258
Snakes have different scales
on top of their heads,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.135
as they do the rest
of their body.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.595
Your head, we'll do, like,
the head pattern.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.765
I'm tattooing her head,
so my scale pattern

08:35.847 --> 08:38.433
looks different 'cause of
the different type of scale.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.727
The other three need to be
exactly the same.

08:40.811 --> 08:45.107
They're circles
with tiny little [bleep] scales

08:45.191 --> 08:46.943
and then
that iridescent pattern.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.070
{\an8}The challenge is
to transform her.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.071
{\an8}If these two touched--

08:50.154 --> 08:52.657
{\an7}two pieces together
and two pieces together--

08:52.740 --> 08:53.616
{\an8}it would be better than not.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.202
{\an8}I'm excited about Chris
being on the team

08:56.285 --> 08:58.454
{\an8}because he's a Marine
and I'm a soldier.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.164
We'll work together,
and let's get a stencil

09:00.248 --> 09:01.165
that works for everybody...

09:01.249 --> 09:03.292
(Katie)
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.168
So that we can all do

- You guys--no.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.310
- You did wonderful.
- Absolutely.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.437
{\an8}Team Cheetah didn't finish
their tattoo.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.356
Chris walked them into a battle
that it does not seem

17:46.440 --> 17:47.941
like there was any possible way

17:48.025 --> 17:49.485
for them to complete
this tattoo.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.486
Good job getting her
through four hours.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.237
Chris needs to take
some sensitivity training

17:52.321 --> 17:56.033
for putting that girl
through all that torture.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.076
{\an5}(Chris B)
We weren't going for the safe.
We were going for the win.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.912
As soon as you guys even laid
that thing out,

17:59.995 --> 18:01.497
I was like, "That's a gamble."

18:01.580 --> 18:02.664
(Kruseman)
Y'all went too big.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.458
You did too much
on that little teeny girl,

18:04.541 --> 18:05.667
and she just couldn't handle it.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.420
{\an8}Chris should have known better
as the leader of this team

18:08.504 --> 18:11.507
{\an8}not to talk this girl into doing
such a large-scale tattoo.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.758
Have some sympathy
for this chick, bro.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.260
What's the matter with you?
Are you even a human being?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.012
{\an3}It looked
pretty [bleep] brutal.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.430
All the decisions that we made

18:18.514 --> 18:20.641
throughout that tattoo
were professional.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.393
I've never in 18 years
put that much effort

18:23.477 --> 18:25.187
into keeping somebody there.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.773
I mean, we were working her
in every way possible.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.025
Do you guys feel
that your tattoo

18:30.108 --> 18:31.610
is presentable the way it is?

18:31.693 --> 18:32.903
That's the only thing
that's gonna hurt us,

18:32.986 --> 18:34.029
is that it's not finished.

18:34.112 --> 18:34.988
So close.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.198
(Craig)
I honestly feel like you guys

18:36.281 --> 18:38.158
are gonna be confronted
with taking a gamble.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.577
{\an5}(Chris B)
And I'll stand up and take
that responsibility.

18:41.703 --> 18:45.415
[industrial music]

18:45.499 --> 18:53.507
{\an8}♪ ♪

18:56.260 --> 18:57.553
For this elimination tattoo,

18:57.636 --> 19:00.222
you had to show texture
in teams of four,

19:00.305 --> 19:03.725
tattooing the same canvas
at the same time.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.520
Remember, you're being
judged as a team.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.105
Let's see how you did.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.315
Tyler, Matt, Duffy,
and St. Marq.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.488
You pulled
the Brazilian rainbow boa.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.490
We kind of lucked out having
Tyler on our side.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.118
I just have like over a hundred
venomous snakes at home.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.703
So he knows what one
of these things looks like.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.372
{\an1}I do like the texture here.
It's definitely snake texture.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.915
{\an5}(Oliver)
Yeah, but snakes have
distinctive pattern,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.417
and these scales are so big

19:28.500 --> 19:31.169
that we're only seeing one half
of one circle of the pattern,

19:31.253 --> 19:34.047
so the whole pattern
doesn't play out.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.425
The girl came in, said, "I want
a Brazilian rainbow boa."

19:36.508 --> 19:37.759
What are the characteristics
of that snake?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.177
A specific pattern.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.097
Y'all didn't show enough
of the distinctive pattern

19:42.180 --> 19:44.766
to really scream
Brazilian rainbow boa.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.268
(Chris)
Tyler, you're a snake expert.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.769
Are you gonna know what this is?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.104
I would, just 'cause
I'm super familiar with it.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.607
{\an8}(Oliver)
Tyler, one thing
about your tattoo

19:51.690 --> 19:53.442
{\an8}is the browner,
oranger scales

19:53.525 --> 19:54.860
{\an8}look a little more like stones.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.029
The actual scales
on a boa's head

19:57.112 --> 19:59.281
are more like plates
next to each other.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.699
No matter what kind
of scale it is,

20:00.782 --> 20:01.742
there's still a way to tell

20:01.825 --> 20:02.951
which direction
the scale is going,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.746
and that's something that
I feel like is lost in this one.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.955
But technically, it's smooth,

20:07.039 --> 20:08.332
and you're definitely the one
that set the bar on this.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.126
As far as trying to capture
that iridescent glow,

20:11.209 --> 20:13.295
it lends it to have
that texture.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.298
{\an7}As far as achieving
a snakelike texture here,

20:16.381 --> 20:20.135
{\an8}I don't think Duffy's was
as well-executed as Tyler,

20:20.218 --> 20:21.970
{\an7}but my biggest concern
about this

20:22.054 --> 20:24.139
{\an7}is just the size
and placement.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.057
This looks like she's been

20:25.140 --> 20:26.433
{\an1}in a motorcycle accident
or something.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.476
{\an1}You know what I mean?
Like road rash.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.646
{\an1}Your shape of the piece you did
is the problem.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.105
The left side of the tattoo

20:32.189 --> 20:34.107
{\an1}should have just mirrored that
curve of the butt cheek,

20:34.191 --> 20:35.067
just make an oval.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.151
She did have other tattoos,

20:36.234 --> 20:37.486
{\an3}and I didn't wanna
interfere with them.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.572
{\an1}I'm just saying that one side
just doesn't fit.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.116
{\an1}Nobody thinks
it's a nice fit.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.701
{\an7}In terms
of working as a team,

20:44.785 --> 20:47.913
{\an8}St. Marq, yours seems
to be less iridescent

20:47.996 --> 20:48.872
{\an8}than the rest of the field,

20:48.956 --> 20:51.166
{\an7}and it also seems to be
a little bit darker.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.044
{\an7}You did more of a solid
kind of approach to this.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.421
{\an7}Your three teammates
have so much more

20:56.505 --> 20:58.340
{\an8}in every individual scale.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.967
{\an7}The main thing
about this challenge

21:00.050 --> 21:01.426
{\an8}is everybody working as a team,

21:01.510 --> 21:04.346
{\an8}getting the same technical ideas
of where to put these highlights

21:04.429 --> 21:06.181
{\an8}and make all four
of these tattoos

21:06.264 --> 21:07.641
{\an7}look like the same person
did it.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.850
{\an1}One person's doing
their own thing over here

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
{\an1}and not paying attention to
what the other three are doing,

21:11.103 --> 21:13.188
they're jeopardizing the team.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.067
Mother[bleep].

21:17.150 --> 21:20.821
{\an5}(Dave)
Kruseman, Craig,
Erik, and Marisa.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.200
So you guys had the crocodile.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.535
What was the overall plan here?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.412
{\an3}All of us weren't tattooing
at the same time.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.746
(Kruseman)
We stayed kind of small.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.000
{\an5}(Oliver)
Layout, design, placement,
color palette

21:33.083 --> 21:34.042
all look very alike.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.212
{\an8}Nobody went off on their own.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.423
{\an8}The team worked really strong
together here.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.259
{\an8}Kruseman and Craig,
you definitely show us texture.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.094
{\an8}You really show each little
plate pushing forward,

21:44.177 --> 21:46.179
{\an8}and then you show the depth
behind it.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.682
{\an8}The execution is really strong.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.479
{\an8}I think Erik's tattoo is right
on par with Kruseman and Craig.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.398
{\an8}You have a little bit different
look to this tattoo,

21:56.481 --> 21:59.317
{\an8}little bit more black area
between the pits.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.237
{\an8}As far as the tattoo,
really well-executed.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.948
{\an8}Marisa, the attention
to detail in small textures

22:05.032 --> 22:06.283
{\an8}plays to your advantage in this.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.659
With three years tattooing,

22:07.743 --> 22:09.286
you're the one that had
to rise to the occasion,

22:09.369 --> 22:11.288
and you definitely stayed in
with the boys.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.414
- Nice job.
- Thanks.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.628
{\an5}(Dave)
Chris, Dave, Big Ceeze,
and Katie.

22:21.339 --> 22:22.466
Your team's--

22:22.549 --> 22:23.550
{\an3}Can I say that I'm very upset
with their critique?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.801
{\an3}I think they got
thrown a gold medal

22:24.885 --> 22:26.428
for a silver performance.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.305
{\an3}By luck of the draw,
they got the easy one.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.306
{\an9}You know, anybody
can create a good texture

22:29.389 --> 22:31.683
{\an9}when you have
predesigned bubbles

22:31.767 --> 22:33.935
{\an9}and you just simply color them
dark to light fade out

22:34.019 --> 22:35.062
{\an8}with a white highlight on top.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.397
{\an1}Someone could argue that
you got the luck of the draw

22:37.481 --> 22:38.607
{\an1}in terms
of this cheetah being

22:38.690 --> 22:41.485
{\an1}the easiest
identifiable pattern.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.071
Yeah, but it wasn't
the easiest texture-wise,

22:44.154 --> 22:47.199
because the only texture
in it would be the fur,

22:47.282 --> 22:49.993
so we wanted to do it at a size
where you could see the texture.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.578
We made a team decision

22:51.661 --> 22:53.622
to try to group
the pieces together

22:53.705 --> 22:55.749
to cover a little more area
for the part of the challenge

22:55.832 --> 22:57.542
that meant
transforming the body.

22:57.626 --> 23:01.004
The canvas sat pretty well
for a little while,

23:01.088 --> 23:04.132
and it eventually ended
in her having a panic attack.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.133
It's enormous.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.134
I don't think any of us

23:06.218 --> 23:07.385
would have felt good
getting that.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.678
Was there a team leader
in this?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.639
I feel like I kind of stepped up
as the leader.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.599
{\an7}I know that you have
the ability

23:12.682 --> 23:14.476
{\an7}to really get a lot
of coverage really quick.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.646
{\an7}The idea that
your other three team partners

23:17.729 --> 23:19.106
{\an8}would be able to do the same

23:19.189 --> 23:21.483
{\an7}might have been ambitious
to say the least.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.485
{\an1}If you accept that ability
as team leader,

23:23.568 --> 23:25.320
{\an1}you have to set them up
for success, not failure.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.322
{\an1}The finished product
is what it is.

23:27.405 --> 23:28.657
This is what we're judging.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.659
Chris, I think you definitely
displayed an amazing technique

23:30.742 --> 23:34.329
{\an1}of really capturing that fur and
showing us that you understand

23:34.413 --> 23:35.330
{\an1}what it takes to build texture
in a tattoo.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.333
{\an7}Chris and Dave,
you guys worked together

23:38.416 --> 23:39.501
{\an7}on a piece
that blended together.

23:39.584 --> 23:43.672
{\an7}Ceeze and Katie, yours did not
really come off seamless.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.425
{\an7}Katie has a motion,
and, Ceeze, yours did not.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.511
{\an7}Your spots have
a different look.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.347
{\an8}The background yellow, there's
a lot of weird, patchy areas.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.141
{\an1}As far as judging texture
for me,

23:54.224 --> 23:55.225
{\an1}this one falls
a little bit flat.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.103
{\an3}Instead of trying to get
all the yellow that I can,

23:58.186 --> 23:59.688
{\an3}I should have just stood
down at the bottom

23:59.771 --> 24:01.231
and tried to get
all my textures

24:01.314 --> 24:02.357
{\an3}and just took
my time with that.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.359
{\an1}As an unfinished tattoo,
it's tough to say.

24:04.442 --> 24:07.612
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.700
{\an1}Judges, do we have
a winning team?

24:11.783 --> 24:15.245
{\an5}(Chris)
In my head, if I run my finger
across three different tattoos,

24:15.328 --> 24:17.622
my finger would have
the most bumps in the crocodile.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.374
That's how I'm thinking of it.

24:19.457 --> 24:22.586
I just wanna point out that
the crocodile as an animal

24:22.669 --> 24:25.046
has more texture than a snake.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.382
{\an8}But as far as execution
between all four artists

24:27.465 --> 24:28.466
{\an8}doing the same thing,

24:28.550 --> 24:30.969
{\an7}Matt and Tyler and St. Marq
and Duffy

24:31.052 --> 24:33.263
{\an7}all had almost completely
different executions.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.556
The whole point
of this challenge

24:34.639 --> 24:37.726
was to make our canvas
look like the animal, right?

24:37.809 --> 24:38.977
That was the main focus.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.061
Not we're all supposed to do

24:40.145 --> 24:41.479
the same [bleep] tattoo
on someone, right?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.148
{\an1}What was
the main challenge?

24:43.231 --> 24:44.941
- Texture.
- Bingo.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.526
{\an5}(Tyler)
I agree that
they did great texture,

24:46.610 --> 24:48.570
but it's just, like,
right off the bat,

24:48.653 --> 24:49.779
I don't see a [bleep] crocodile.

24:49.863 --> 24:53.658
{\an1}If I look at the exact reference
of the part of the crocodile

24:53.742 --> 24:56.620
that they emulated, it looks
exactly like that reference.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.080
I mean, this is what I do
on a [bleep] daily basis.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.290
{\an1}You're gonna be judged
as a team.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.292
{\an1}A chain is only as strong
its weakest link.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.295
{\an7}If the other three people
on your team would have executed

25:05.378 --> 25:09.049
{\an8}their tattoo exactly as you did
and you didn't outshine anybody,

25:09.132 --> 25:12.219
{\an7}then your team
would have been strong.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.931
Looking at cohesive designs,
looking at teamwork,

25:16.014 --> 25:18.725
and looking at execution,
I'm going with the crocodile.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.769
{\an1}I'm voting
for the crocodile.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.561
The judges have decided.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.231
{\an1}Kruseman, Erik, Marisa,
and Craig,

25:24.314 --> 25:25.982
{\an1}you have the best tattoo
of the day.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.485
Congratulations.

25:28.568 --> 25:31.279
{\an1}The four of you are safe
from elimination.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.575
{\an1}However, the rest of you
are not.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.103
I think in a perfect world,

From a distance, man,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.449
this thing looks really smooth
and really slick.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.576
The texture you put in there
shows a lot of depth,

36:43.659 --> 36:45.161
and it really lets this thing
look three-dimensional.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.580
You have a crisp outline
around the outside,

36:47.663 --> 36:49.040
and it gives it the strength,

36:49.123 --> 36:50.333
but the veins that come down
through the heart

36:50.416 --> 36:51.667
that don't have any outline,

36:51.751 --> 36:53.461
that's the one part
where you could've used

36:53.544 --> 36:54.170
a little more definition.

36:54.253 --> 36:56.297
To have at least one crisp edge,

36:56.380 --> 36:58.966
it would've made that definition
stand out,

36:59.050 --> 37:00.301
but it's a very nice effect
overall.

37:00.384 --> 37:04.347
This whole tattoo plays
very strongly to your strengths.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.529
has a lot of examples
of really great texture,

37:20.613 --> 37:22.865
especially the little pits and
the muscles down at the bottom,

37:22.949 --> 37:23.950
really good 3-D image.

37:24.033 --> 37:27.495
Technically, this is
a super sleek tattoo, man.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.497
But the vibrant colors
in this thing--

37:29.580 --> 37:30.915
everything's so glossy

37:30.998 --> 37:32.500
that it doesn't really have
a lot of depth to it.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.670
And that's the one thing that
St. Marq was able to pull off,

37:35.753 --> 37:36.629
was a lot of depth.

37:36.712 --> 37:37.463
{\an3}Oh, my God.

that I've seen

37:41.217 --> 37:42.176

So I gave you
a line work challenge,

37:43.719 --> 37:45.346
I gave you a depth challenge,
I gave you a contrast challenge,

37:45.429 --> 37:48.724
and I put five different types
of texture in there

37:48.808 --> 37:50.017
that are clearly visible.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.311
Yours is very medical journal.

is so vibrant.

It has a very strong,
wet, textury feel to it.

is very lackluster

you have in the foreground.

It's not in

over St. Marq's,

38:11.831 --> 38:13.541
{\an3}you would feel
a smooth object.

{\an3}If you rub your finger
across Chris's,

38:16.377 --> 38:18.838
{\an3}you would feel
all the texture of the fat,

38:18.921 --> 38:20.339
{\an3}you would feel
the texture of--
