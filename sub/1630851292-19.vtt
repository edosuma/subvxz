15:31.765 --> 15:33.247
You don't like him either?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.933

he'll lose attention

15:49.190 --> 15:51.691
You are the baby! A male baby.

15:51.843 --> 15:53.434
Look, I know all kids

15:53.602 --> 15:55.436

and pretend to be adults.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.680

a new twist to this--

15:59.608 --> 16:01.608
I don't want to diminish
how weird this is--

16:01.703 --> 16:02.961
but it's time for it to stop.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.463

you are not pregnant.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.510
(crying)

16:12.639 --> 16:15.198
Okay, look, I-I didn't mean
to break it to you so harshly.

16:15.216 --> 16:16.882
No, no. I just realized

16:17.018 --> 16:19.644
now that I'm pregnant,
I can't eat sushi.

16:19.871 --> 16:22.038
(sighs)
You know what? Fine.

16:22.056 --> 16:23.481
-You're pregnant.
-Thank you.

16:23.632 --> 16:25.632
It's just too bad you're gonna
gain all that weight.

16:25.727 --> 16:28.302
-What?
-When you're pregnant,
you gain, like, 30 pounds.

16:28.396 --> 16:29.879
30 pounds?

16:29.897 --> 16:31.489
But I only weigh 15.

16:31.716 --> 16:34.475
Well, no matter.
At least I'll sleep comfortably

16:34.569 --> 16:37.662
and continue to have the
same-sized, not-swollen feet.

16:39.224 --> 16:41.240
But I just bought
Thom Browne boots.

16:41.392 --> 16:43.893
I got them for myself
as a push present.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.169

16:45.321 --> 16:47.654
Enjoy the miracle of life.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.899
Oh, dear. Perhaps being pregnant

16:49.992 --> 16:51.492
will be more difficult
than I thought.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.161

a gender reveal party.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.163

17:04.340 --> 17:07.191
Oh, man, that bear
kicked our asses.

17:07.343 --> 17:09.585
Well, thank God we're all okay.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.856
Damn it!

17:22.876 --> 17:24.208
Don't you see, fellas?

17:24.360 --> 17:27.103
We made a oath to the mayor
to get our manhood back.

17:27.196 --> 17:29.047
And our hats are that manhood.

17:29.198 --> 17:31.440
So, we've got to find that bear
and get it back.

17:31.459 --> 17:33.384
I don't know,
that sounds dangerous.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.553
Come on, the whole reason
we came here

17:35.704 --> 17:37.296
is 'cause we've turned
into cowards.

17:37.448 --> 17:39.615
The mayor wanted us
to finish this cattle drive

17:39.634 --> 17:42.285
like real cowboys, and that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

17:42.378 --> 17:43.969
We'll do it
with courage and teamwork.

17:44.122 --> 17:45.563
Who's with me?

17:47.125 --> 17:49.192
Yeah, that's the spirit.

17:51.796 --> 17:54.888
Well, Bri, I'm heading out
for sushi in my new boots.

17:54.966 --> 17:56.908
So I'm guessing
you got rid of the baby?

17:57.059 --> 17:58.743
Yes, it was a tough decision.

17:58.894 --> 18:00.578
But today I took
a morning-after cocktail

18:00.729 --> 18:03.397
of Flintstones vitamins,
Ovaltine, castor oil,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.583
and a splash of Dr. Pepper,
since its name

18:05.734 --> 18:08.311
is both a medical professional
and a vegetable.

18:08.329 --> 18:09.829
Well, I think you made
the right decision.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.072
Me too.
I'm probably the only person

18:12.166 --> 18:15.167
under 18 ever to say this,
but being pregnant is fun

18:15.261 --> 18:17.837
until it forces you
to make sacrifices in any way.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.840
Uh, yeah, I guess
that's an okay takeaway.

18:20.992 --> 18:23.750
I just hope little Timothée
or Chalamet understands.

18:23.845 --> 18:25.845
I think he or she
would have grown up

18:25.997 --> 18:27.496
to be a strong woman

18:27.515 --> 18:29.423
or a very weak man.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.685
So, uh, you know that you
were never pregnant, right?

18:32.837 --> 18:34.779
Yes, I went to the hospital
for a sonogram

18:34.930 --> 18:36.597
and got yelled at
by an angry nurse.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.932
In case you were wondering
whether she likes nonsense,

Now give me back my hat,
you son of a bitch.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.062
WEST:
Good job, fellas.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.006
You really showed me something.

19:36.567 --> 19:37.717
(all gasp)

19:37.826 --> 19:39.159
Old Man West?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.403
The owner of the ranch?

19:40.496 --> 19:42.180
Peter, this isn't<i> Scooby-Doo.</i>

19:42.331 --> 19:44.073
You ever notice
how most<i> Scooby-Doo</i> villains

19:44.091 --> 19:45.408
are small businessmen?

19:45.426 --> 19:47.518
Who doesn't like
small businessmen?

19:47.745 --> 19:49.595
Odd choice by the creators.

19:49.747 --> 19:52.097
Sorry to put you boys
through the paces,

19:52.250 --> 19:54.750
but I felt like you needed
a little nudge

19:54.769 --> 19:56.268
to find your courage.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.363
Here, Peter, you earned this.

20:02.093 --> 20:03.426
Thanks, Mr. Mayor.

20:03.444 --> 20:05.611
I'm gonna wear this hat forever.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.446
Actually, Peter,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.373
the hat chooses you.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.436
♪<i> If you leave, I won't cry</i> ♪

20:13.454 --> 20:16.005
♪<i> I won't waste</i>
<i> one single day.</i> ♪

20:21.946 --> 20:23.779
Oh, it's good to have
you home, Peter.

20:23.798 --> 20:24.947
Thanks.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.331
The ranch was nice,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.041
but I think the big lesson here

20:28.061 --> 20:29.876
is that no experience is worth

20:29.896 --> 20:32.379
-sleeping on the ground.
-Oh, God, no.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.716
And my groin is a raging fire
from one day on a horse.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.978
Kids, don't ever do things
you don't normally do.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.312
You'll just be punished for it.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.815
(cackles)
My blue-collar dad

20:42.967 --> 20:45.058
is hostile to new experiences.

20:45.152 --> 20:47.319
-(car horn honking)
-Well, that's Bonnie and Donna.

20:47.472 --> 20:48.579
-I have to go.
-What?

20:48.731 --> 20:51.231
Oh, the mayor
also runs a ranch for women

20:51.325 --> 20:53.400
trying to get in touch
with their femininity.

20:53.494 --> 20:56.479
Ladies, these grocery carts
are an oath.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.965
Pretty sure the male version
of this is better.

20:59.074 --> 21:02.510
I might say the same thing
about<i> Ghostbusters.</i>
