WEBVTT

01:43.387 --> 01:45.842
Oh, is it morning already?

02:32.592 --> 02:34.391
Jarrod.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.264
Jarrod, wake up.

02:41.149 --> 02:43.224
It's OK.

02:54.578 --> 02:56.737
What is that?

02:56.737 --> 02:58.492
I don't know.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.286
Hey.

03:08.299 --> 03:10.042
Stay here.

03:11.302 --> 03:13.840
- What's wrong?
- He's gone.

03:28.610 --> 03:31.232
Jarrod. Jarrod.

03:36.492 --> 03:37.332
Jarrod.

03:40.789 --> 03:42.864
Jarrod.

04:07.521 --> 04:09.561
We will be starting beverage service.

04:09.561 --> 04:12.188
For a complete list of choices,

04:12.188 --> 04:15.396
please see the last page
of your in-flight magazine.

04:16.363 --> 04:18.935
I can't decide.

04:18.935 --> 04:21.192
Elaine, you pick the last one.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.994
J-Rock? T-Money?

04:33.994 --> 04:37.256
Oh, no, we were...
we were ahead of our time.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.299
We're bad.

04:39.299 --> 04:43.252
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Neither's Terry.

04:44.431 --> 04:48.096
You will see. He's the real deal.

04:48.096 --> 04:50.011
Can't wait.

05:16.836 --> 05:21.130
Well, you should have thought about that
before you shot the piece of shit.

05:22.092 --> 05:25.294
- What are you doing here so early?
- It's a beautiful day.

05:25.294 --> 05:27.379
Don't I know it.

05:27.379 --> 05:29.429
Ray called again
about the robot sequence.

05:29.429 --> 05:32.718
Tell him to handle it.
No business on my birthday.

05:36.271 --> 05:40.056
- Hey.
- God, does she always have to be here?

05:40.056 --> 05:42.142
She's working. Show biz, baby.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.774
Mm. You're all sweaty.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.299
Hey. You feeling all right?

06:10.299 --> 06:13.388
- Yeah. Yeah, I am fine.
- OK.

06:19.354 --> 06:22.023
Here. Let me get that for you.
There you go.

06:22.023 --> 06:24.680
- Thank you.
- No problem.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.602
That's my fine hero.

06:26.602 --> 06:28.651
Let's go.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.781
Yeah, that's us.

06:45.003 --> 06:47.042
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

06:47.042 --> 06:50.913
- You better not get used to this.
- Who, me?

07:27.125 --> 07:29.202
Penthouse.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.458
- All right. Come on.
- Going down.

07:34.799 --> 07:37.041
How's the second most talented guy
I know?

07:37.041 --> 07:39.791
- I don't know. How are you?
- I am good.

07:42.014 --> 07:43.758
Happy birthday.

07:43.758 --> 07:46.554
- Oh, my God.
- You must be Elaine. Welcome.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.229
This is amazing.

07:50.229 --> 07:52.805
Automatic living at its finest.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.307
My own personal place in the clouds.

07:55.307 --> 07:58.652
The view is incredible.

07:58.652 --> 08:02.487
Let me ask you a question.
You keeping my boy in line?

08:02.487 --> 08:04.734
Don't answer that.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.402
- Hey.
- It's a full-time job.

08:07.402 --> 08:10.616
Well, whatever he's paying you,
I will double it.

08:10.616 --> 08:14.290
Well, it looks like
you have got your hands full already.

08:14.290 --> 08:17.711
I like her, yeah.
That's your room right there.

08:17.711 --> 08:21.713
- You guys want to hit the pool?
- Absolutely.

08:21.713 --> 08:25.170
Baby. Pool time.

08:33.270 --> 08:35.596
- Baby, get me a cosmo.
- Absolutely. Hold this.

08:35.596 --> 08:37.645
Hey, bar's this way.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.398
- You really did it, man.
- Yeah.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.446
Just like everybody
knew you would, but...

08:45.446 --> 08:48.320
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.699
Couldn't have done it without you.

08:50.699 --> 08:54.037
- What'd I do, decorate the walls?
- They do look nice.

08:54.037 --> 08:55.950
- They do look nice.
- Mm-hm.

08:55.950 --> 08:58.332
Happy birthday, Terry.

08:58.332 --> 09:01.420
Yeah. Happy birthday to me.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.458
I can't thank you enough for this, man.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.422
I am the one who should be
getting you a gift.

09:09.422 --> 09:12.347
I got some ideas on that. Come on.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.182
I see everyone's getting along famously.

09:20.022 --> 09:21.766
- Baby.
- Yeah.

09:21.766 --> 09:23.732
Where's my cosmo?

09:23.732 --> 09:25.978
Oh, my bad.

09:25.978 --> 09:28.192
Denise, get me a drink.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.906
- Anyone else?
- No.

09:35.454 --> 09:37.529
Hey, this definitely beats
Brooklyn in December.

09:37.529 --> 09:41.869
- I kind of like having four seasons.
- We got one of those down the block.

09:41.869 --> 09:44.795
Tomorrow we going to hit the high seas.

09:44.795 --> 09:47.204
I am going to take you all out
on my Sunseeker.

09:49.258 --> 09:52.260
67 footer. My starter yacht.

09:58.559 --> 09:59.674
Homeland Security.

09:59.674 --> 10:03.101
They must be here because they know
tonight's party's going to be a bomb.

10:03.101 --> 10:05.145
Baby... Oh.

10:07.806 --> 10:10.061
Cheers.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.149
Happy birthday, Terry.

10:13.149 --> 10:14.733
- Hey, man.
- Nice job, man.

10:14.733 --> 10:16.984
- How's it going, man?
- Happy birthday, Terry.

10:20.371 --> 10:22.660
There's somebody
I want you to meet. Ray.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.120
Hold on.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.961
What's up, man? Happy birthday, man.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.129
Thank you.
How's the robot fight coming along?

10:31.129 --> 10:36.255
Dude, it sucks. But the director
loves it, so, you know...

10:36.255 --> 10:38.503
- Hey, is this the boy wonder?
- Yeah.

10:38.503 --> 10:42.298
And his lovely lady, yeah. Right.

10:42.298 --> 10:45.012
- Hey, it's good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet you too.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.724
I am psyched
you're going to join the crew.

10:47.724 --> 10:50.898
- Huh?
- Did you find a place to live yet?

10:50.898 --> 10:53.391
I am telling you,
Venice is where it's at.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.735
We will keep that in mind. Thank you.
I live there, so I will show you around.

10:56.735 --> 11:00.109
I have to go use the little girls' room.
Excuse me.

11:00.109 --> 11:01.860
No... Babe...

11:01.860 --> 11:04.870
- Elaine.
- Bro, she's smoking.

11:04.870 --> 11:06.912
- Nice job, dude.
- Excellent.

11:06.912 --> 11:09.536
- Way to go.
- What's he talking about?

11:09.536 --> 11:11.286
What's going on, ladies?

11:12.169 --> 11:14.791
- I am sorry.
- What was that about? Jeez...

11:14.791 --> 11:18.831
OK, look,
cat's obviously out of the bag.

11:20.177 --> 11:24.091
I have been thinking...
You should move to LA.

11:25.349 --> 11:29.761
What am I going to do out here?
I am barely surviving back home.

11:29.761 --> 11:33.139
- I could use you.
- I don't need any charity, all right?

11:33.139 --> 11:36.849
OK, fine. I need you.

11:36.849 --> 11:38.853
I don't know
anything about effects, man.

11:38.853 --> 11:41.602
- That's bullshit. Come on, man.
- That's not bullshit.

11:41.602 --> 11:45.908
You got the eye and you know it.
The computer is just a tool.

11:47.244 --> 11:51.574
I just... I don't know, OK?
I never saw myself out here.

11:52.499 --> 11:56.959
Where do you see yourself? You got
a five-year plan I don't know about?

11:56.959 --> 11:59.501
Look, it's not about the money, OK?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.878
It's always about the money.

12:05.511 --> 12:06.626
What about Elaine?

12:09.139 --> 12:12.840
I can't handle everything.
You got to take care of that yourself.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.556
Terry,
there's a call for you upstairs.

12:15.556 --> 12:17.805
You think about it.

12:33.913 --> 12:35.988
Elaine.

12:41.670 --> 12:46.379
Come on. We're supposed to be
having fun. What's the problem?

12:46.379 --> 12:48.708
Just forget it, all right?

12:50.387 --> 12:54.384
Look, Terry sprung this whole
California thing on me today, all right?

12:54.384 --> 12:57.642
- I had no idea. I didn't come out...
- I am late.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.268
What do you mean, late?

13:00.268 --> 13:01.518
Late.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.854
Oh. Sorry.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.365
- Since when?
- I don't know.

13:17.537 --> 13:21.202
I have been feeling sick all week,
so I took a test and...

13:22.333 --> 13:24.207
Why didn't you tell me?

13:24.207 --> 13:26.914
I wanted to.

13:26.914 --> 13:30.124
Believe me, I just...
I didn't want to ruin your trip.

13:30.124 --> 13:32.375
You didn't...

13:36.763 --> 13:37.878
Shit.

13:37.878 --> 13:40.014
Is that all you have to say?

13:40.014 --> 13:42.674
What do you want me to say?

13:44.771 --> 13:47.725
- I don't think I am ready for this.
- You're not ready, Jarrod?

13:47.725 --> 13:50.650
- What about me?
- It's not...

13:50.650 --> 13:53.439
Hey, will you get...

14:02.120 --> 14:05.454
Is that what we have to look forward to?

14:09.335 --> 14:11.411
Lainey...

14:19.303 --> 14:21.545
Right. Ready.

14:21.545 --> 14:25.387
Here we go, here we go.
I think we have got a live one. Whoo.

14:26.602 --> 14:29.009
We have a wiener.

14:29.772 --> 14:32.688
That's what I am talking about. Whoo.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.850
Oh, yeah. Go.

14:34.850 --> 14:37.778
Go. Go. Go. Go.

14:39.948 --> 14:42.153
Oh, my God. No.

14:43.784 --> 14:45.065
- God, no.
- No.

14:45.065 --> 14:45.815
No.

14:46.829 --> 14:48.905
Oh, my God.

14:57.172 --> 15:00.956
Pardon me, ma'am, but we have received
a few noise complaints.

15:00.956 --> 15:03.091
From who?

15:03.091 --> 15:05.633
- The building's half empty.
- I understand that.

15:05.633 --> 15:09.138
But the other half is trying to sleep.
So if you don't mind, just...

15:09.138 --> 15:10.803
- Fine.
- OK.

15:25.615 --> 15:28.735
- Another one for the books.
- Oh, yeah.

15:30.746 --> 15:33.449
Well, well, well.

15:33.449 --> 15:36.114
- Mm-mm. I call the couch.
- Oh, come on.

15:36.114 --> 15:38.748
There's plenty of room for both of us.
I like my space.

15:38.748 --> 15:41.291
Whoa. All right.

15:41.291 --> 15:43.539
Beggars can't be choosers.

15:52.891 --> 15:54.967
Good night.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.880
Earthquake?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.964
Probably just a tremor.

17:43.703 --> 17:46.029
What the...?

18:05.640 --> 18:07.467
Turn off the lights.

18:18.945 --> 18:19.945
Ray.

18:21.655 --> 18:23.731
What are you doing?

18:28.037 --> 18:29.198
Ray.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.447
What is that?

18:41.757 --> 18:42.757
Ray.

18:49.348 --> 18:51.756
Stay here.

18:53.811 --> 18:55.886
- What's wrong?
- He's gone.

19:06.114 --> 19:07.822
Jarrod, no.

19:08.491 --> 19:10.862
Jarrod, no.

19:10.862 --> 19:13.952
- Jarrod. Jarrod. No.
- What the hell's going on?

19:13.952 --> 19:16.695
Terry, please. Terry, help.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.123
What's with you, man?

19:22.963 --> 19:23.803
Jarrod.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.748
Oh, my God. Jarrod, Jarrod.

19:27.748 --> 19:31.211
- Jarrod.
- Please. What's happening?

19:32.805 --> 19:36.589
- Jarrod?
- Jarrod. Oh, God. Oh, my God.

19:36.589 --> 19:40.017
Jarrod. What is that?

19:42.356 --> 19:44.183
What's wrong with him?

19:45.442 --> 19:47.518
Jarrod. Oh, my God.

19:48.570 --> 19:51.275
- Where's Ray? Where's Ray?
- Terry, no.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.026
- No, no.
- Jarrod?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.574
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

19:54.574 --> 19:56.320
- What do you mean?
- He's gone.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.365
- Did he fall? Did he jump?
- No. I don't know, I don't know.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.618
Please. Please. Please.

20:03.618 --> 20:06.414
He went outside, to the light.

20:08.047 --> 20:10.751
And then he... he just disappeared.

20:14.219 --> 20:15.927
Baby.

20:17.055 --> 20:19.012
Terry, please.

20:38.867 --> 20:43.695
Jarrod, look at me. What did you
see, huh? What did you see?

20:46.708 --> 20:47.787
Careful.

20:58.302 --> 21:00.378
Jarrod, what happened?

21:02.764 --> 21:04.591
I don't know.

21:08.937 --> 21:10.645
I was being pulled...

21:11.898 --> 21:14.650
...towards this light.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.782
Hey, open the blinds.

21:25.782 --> 21:27.862
- No.
- Open the blinds.

21:27.862 --> 21:30.031
- No.
- God.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.509
- There's something down there.
- What?

21:45.509 --> 21:47.222
Jarrod, check this out.

22:00.443 --> 22:02.732
I don't see anything.

22:03.947 --> 22:08.489
- There are people on the roof.
- What are they doing?

22:08.489 --> 22:11.233
I don't know.

22:12.580 --> 22:16.625
- We should check it out.
- You don't know what's out there.

22:20.462 --> 22:22.538
- Yeah, OK.
- All right.

22:22.538 --> 22:24.791
I am calling the police.

22:27.886 --> 22:31.136
- I will try and get some pictures.
- You can't go out there.

22:32.474 --> 22:34.181
I can't let him go out there alone.

22:34.181 --> 22:36.307
It just keeps ringing.

22:42.149 --> 22:44.474
A gun? Really?

22:44.474 --> 22:47.653
Just check the news and find out
what the hell is going on.

22:47.653 --> 22:50.194
- Terry...
- We will be right back.

22:52.033 --> 22:54.109
- Jarrod.
- Look at me.

23:03.753 --> 23:04.784
Let's go.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.836
Hurry back.

23:35.699 --> 23:37.776
Stairs are this way.

24:02.266 --> 24:05.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:05.184 --> 24:07.890
- Damn it, Walt.
- What's going on?

24:07.890 --> 24:11.646
- We're going to check it out.
- What are you doing with a gun?

24:11.646 --> 24:14.486
Get back in your apartment. Go.

24:14.486 --> 24:17.274
And keep it down.

24:23.869 --> 24:24.589
Hey...

24:27.206 --> 24:28.617
You sure about this?

24:39.218 --> 24:41.790
There's been nothing new since 4 a.m.

24:44.013 --> 24:46.090
Denise, check the TV.

25:15.543 --> 25:17.452
It's calm.

25:22.175 --> 25:23.965
Damn it, Jarrod.

25:23.965 --> 25:28.214
- You didn't tell me to hold it open.
- I thought it was common sense.

25:29.515 --> 25:32.005
I am sorry.

25:32.005 --> 25:34.805
Get down.

25:39.857 --> 25:41.933
What now?

25:43.111 --> 25:45.317
Let's get a better look.

25:51.861 --> 25:54.906
Hi, this is Jackie.
Please leave a message.

25:54.906 --> 25:59.991
Mom, it's me. Something's happened...

26:02.295 --> 26:05.165
Pick up. Please just...

26:07.175 --> 26:09.298
Call me back as soon as you get this.

27:09.025 --> 27:11.646
Holy shit.

27:42.222 --> 27:45.757
I can't see it.
Is that what I think it is?

27:50.855 --> 27:52.729
Oh, my God.

28:28.348 --> 28:31.100
- Just run.
- What is it?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.383
- Run.
- Go.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.187
Come on, pull. Back up. Back up.

28:44.281 --> 28:46.985
Come on. Come on.

28:48.576 --> 28:52.408
Come on. Come on.

28:57.418 --> 28:58.378
Come on.

29:02.505 --> 29:04.581
Elaine, no.

29:17.228 --> 29:19.765
Move. Move.

29:20.564 --> 29:23.316
Come on. It's OK.

29:23.316 --> 29:26.153
Baby, are you OK?

29:26.153 --> 29:29.735
I feel like I am on fire.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.658
Come on, baby. I am here.

29:36.537 --> 29:38.162
Give me the... Give it to me.

29:41.626 --> 29:44.911
It will pass in a few minutes.
Look at me.

29:48.048 --> 29:50.125
Look at me.

30:10.361 --> 30:12.437
You looked too.

30:15.533 --> 30:16.533
How?

30:35.426 --> 30:37.715
Oh, my God.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.423
All those people.

30:49.314 --> 30:53.643
- What do they want with them?
- I am not looking to find out.

30:53.643 --> 30:58.030
God, I can't believe this.
I mean, how?

30:58.030 --> 31:00.403
Once you look at the light...

31:03.786 --> 31:07.072
...it grabs hold and it's like...

31:07.072 --> 31:09.323
It controls you.

31:10.250 --> 31:13.619
I mean, who wouldn't want to look
at something so beautiful?

31:15.339 --> 31:17.165
It's kind of brilliant, actually.

31:18.258 --> 31:22.125
Enough of this shit. I got an idea.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.177
- Where are you going?
- Walt.

31:24.177 --> 31:26.054
- What for?
- I worry about him.

31:26.054 --> 31:29.011
- Terry...
- Everything's under control.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.704
Are you OK?

32:01.704 --> 32:04.005
- Yeah, it's nothing.
- Let me see.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.252
I said it's nothing.

32:08.805 --> 32:10.881
All right.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.664
Walt.

32:52.096 --> 32:54.172
Yo, Walt.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.842
Walt.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.097
Walt.

33:04.274 --> 33:06.350
Are you in here?

33:27.961 --> 33:31.380
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hiding.

33:31.380 --> 33:37.303
I saw the people in the sky
like a goddamn rapture.

33:37.303 --> 33:41.421
Come on. We're taking your car and we're
getting the hell out of here. Let's go.

33:41.421 --> 33:43.759
I am not going out there.

33:43.759 --> 33:47.471
Get down. Get down.

33:52.444 --> 33:54.935
- Shh.
- Shut the dog up. Shut the dog up.

34:34.483 --> 34:35.483
Shh.

35:11.727 --> 35:14.300
- No.
- No. No. Walt.

35:44.549 --> 35:46.625
Did you hear that?

35:49.971 --> 35:51.631
What's up? Talk to me.

35:53.016 --> 35:54.558
We're getting on my boat
and getting out of here.

35:54.558 --> 35:56.764
- What happened?
- They took Walt.

35:56.764 --> 35:58.643
They got Walt?
What are you talking about?

35:58.643 --> 36:02.680
This one was different. It came in
the building and it just snatched him.

36:03.818 --> 36:07.150
- Then we should just go.
- Hold on a sec.

36:07.150 --> 36:09.942
Am I the only one who saw those photos?

36:09.942 --> 36:13.364
That's all happening right outside,
right now. They're everywhere.

36:13.364 --> 36:17.235
No, they're not everywhere.
They're not over the water.

36:17.235 --> 36:18.445
That's right.

36:18.445 --> 36:22.834
Yeah, well, it didn't take them very long
to find you on the roof.

36:22.834 --> 36:24.745
We can drive there in two minutes.

36:24.745 --> 36:27.209
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

36:27.209 --> 36:30.465
Elaine, I know you're scared, OK?
We're all scared.

36:30.465 --> 36:33.303
But I am not burying my head in the sand
and hoping this goes away.

36:33.303 --> 36:35.628
- I am not saying that.
- Just take it easy, man.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.047
- There's nothing easy about this.
- I understand...

36:38.047 --> 36:41.059
They're in the fucking building.

36:41.059 --> 36:44.477
- Terry...
- It's the timer.

36:44.477 --> 36:46.723
Oh, my God.

36:53.322 --> 36:54.572
Shit.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.651
All right. Go, go, go. Move.

37:15.843 --> 37:17.385
Shh.

38:11.770 --> 38:15.471
- You're disgusting.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

38:22.530 --> 38:26.363
- We will talk about that later.
- Yeah, we will talk about that.

38:35.585 --> 38:39.961
- Still want to stay?
- I don't want any of this.

38:39.961 --> 38:42.668
But it didn't see us or hear us.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.795
- So if we stay here and stay quiet...
- For how long?

38:45.795 --> 38:48.839
They're taking people out there,
plain and simple.

38:48.839 --> 38:51.968
The further we get out of the city,
the better off we are.

38:52.726 --> 38:55.679
- He's right.
- Jarrod.

38:55.679 --> 38:57.431
If we get to the boat, we have a chance.

38:57.431 --> 38:59.728
- Yeah, but we don't...
- We have to...

39:04.153 --> 39:05.861
We have to try.

39:05.861 --> 39:11.403
Get your stuff.
Pack food and water. Let's do this.

39:26.299 --> 39:28.754
Let's go.

39:51.114 --> 39:52.524
All right, come on.

39:52.524 --> 39:56.032
Look, the sooner I get there,
the sooner the boat's ready to go.

39:56.032 --> 39:57.696
Right here.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.364
- Hey.
- Come on, let's go.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.996
- What...
- What are you doing?

40:00.996 --> 40:04.533
Driving. I know the way.
Why don't you take your slut?

40:04.533 --> 40:06.749
Candice.

40:06.749 --> 40:08.201
Candice.

40:10.089 --> 40:11.631
Get in the car.

40:19.598 --> 40:21.805
Terry, I am sorry.

40:59.886 --> 41:02.459
- Hurry up.
- What do you think I am doing?

41:07.561 --> 41:08.935
- Hey, slow down.
- No.

41:08.935 --> 41:11.142
Just stop.

41:12.064 --> 41:14.602
- You need any help?
- No, just go. We're fine.

41:14.602 --> 41:19.235
- Yeah, but maybe he can help us.
- Enough, all right? I said we're fine.

41:39.465 --> 41:40.185
Terry.

41:51.935 --> 41:53.215
Terry, get up.

41:59.859 --> 42:02.729
- Terry. Terry.
- My God. Terry.

42:13.038 --> 42:15.114
I got you.

42:20.462 --> 42:23.379
Jarrod, get your ass back in here now.

42:24.091 --> 42:26.082
Drive. Drive now.

42:32.681 --> 42:35.682
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car.

42:42.399 --> 42:44.522
Come on. Come on.

42:51.574 --> 42:54.409
Open. Oh, shit.

42:54.409 --> 42:57.282
- Come on.
- Open. God.

42:57.282 --> 42:59.114
Come on.

43:02.209 --> 43:04.285
Open, you piece of shit.

43:07.589 --> 43:11.005
Back up. Back up. Back up. Go.

43:33.905 --> 43:36.313
Oh, my God.

43:36.313 --> 43:39.161
Help me. Help me.

43:42.038 --> 43:44.611
- Help me.
- This way.

43:47.502 --> 43:50.621
Candice, where's the key?
Candice, the key. Turn the key.

44:13.526 --> 44:15.602
Oh, my God.

44:24.786 --> 44:27.075
- You all right?
- I am OK.

44:27.075 --> 44:30.248
- Hm.
- Oh, my God.

44:31.793 --> 44:33.750
- Oh, my God.
- Miss, we have to go.

44:33.750 --> 44:35.295
No, he...

44:36.673 --> 44:38.464
He's alive.

44:38.464 --> 44:39.830
God.

44:42.094 --> 44:43.672
Help me.

45:02.197 --> 45:05.113
Come on, let's go.

45:05.113 --> 45:06.362
Oh, my God.

45:11.622 --> 45:12.462
Go. Go.

45:30.890 --> 45:32.966
Make for the back door.

45:42.985 --> 45:44.396
Run.

46:16.016 --> 46:18.222
Move.

46:25.066 --> 46:25.816
Go.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.870
Don't stop.

46:44.710 --> 46:46.785
Open the door.

46:53.885 --> 46:55.295
- Get it open.
- Back up.

46:55.295 --> 46:57.426
Open it.

47:00.391 --> 47:02.300
Come on.

47:08.023 --> 47:10.858
- Where are we going?
- All the way to the top.

47:10.858 --> 47:13.647
- The safest place I could think of.
- We were just up there.

47:15.812 --> 47:19.938
You want to stay down here with that,
be my guest. Go on. Let's go.

47:24.538 --> 47:27.076
Come on, quickly, quickly, quickly.

48:15.670 --> 48:17.045
Jarrod...

48:17.045 --> 48:19.288
I should have held onto him.

48:27.430 --> 48:30.515
Hey. Come help me with this.

48:49.285 --> 48:51.361
It's better than nothing, right?

48:52.288 --> 48:54.363
Yeah, if you say so.

48:55.999 --> 48:59.867
What are you doing, huh?
Like it or not, this is happening.

49:02.838 --> 49:04.915
You got to be strong.

49:13.349 --> 49:15.306
Is everybody OK?

49:17.770 --> 49:19.014
Are you hurt?

49:20.188 --> 49:22.940
- No.
- I am OK.

49:32.742 --> 49:36.406
- What now?
- We stay here. We keep watch.

49:36.406 --> 49:39.829
- And we pray that someone comes.
- He's right.

49:40.666 --> 49:44.200
Someone's going to come.
This can't go on forever.

49:45.921 --> 49:47.581
Right?

49:55.722 --> 49:58.010
- Elaine...
- It's best if we stay together.

49:58.010 --> 50:00.673
I can't. The smoke.

50:01.977 --> 50:05.097
Given the circumstances,
I think a smoke is more than reasonable.

50:05.097 --> 50:07.349
Candice...

50:09.693 --> 50:12.018
I am pregnant, all right?

50:13.030 --> 50:15.603
And I just thought that...

50:15.603 --> 50:17.858
...between all the stress...

50:23.665 --> 50:25.740
It's OK.

50:29.545 --> 50:31.870
I never even got to tell my mom.

50:44.058 --> 50:46.632
Come on, boss.
Let's let the girls get some sleep.

50:46.632 --> 50:48.887
You and I will keep watch.

50:50.732 --> 50:52.225
Both of us?

50:52.225 --> 50:56.694
They try that light stuff,
we got each other's back.

51:19.216 --> 51:21.293
I hate LA.

51:50.495 --> 51:53.117
I haven't seen a soul all night.

51:55.918 --> 51:58.538
Maybe the worst is over.

51:58.538 --> 52:01.000
Maybe not.

52:03.550 --> 52:06.634
What do you think
those things really are?

52:06.634 --> 52:08.961
I don't know.

52:08.961 --> 52:11.214
Does it even matter?

52:16.353 --> 52:17.847
It just doesn't seems real.

52:21.775 --> 52:24.016
Well, it is real.

52:24.016 --> 52:26.270
You better wake up.

52:28.740 --> 52:32.737
- What's that supposed to mean?
- The city's a vacant lot.

52:32.737 --> 52:34.986
We need to survive.

52:37.498 --> 52:39.954
There's not going to be many of us left.

53:01.813 --> 53:03.722
Let me see.

53:06.608 --> 53:08.269
Somebody's fighting back.

53:11.697 --> 53:14.188
- What are you doing?
- I want to see what's out there.

53:17.786 --> 53:19.280
Oh, my God.

53:27.879 --> 53:29.919
Turn that off. It's too bright.

53:29.919 --> 53:32.046
- No.
- We can't risk it.

53:34.969 --> 53:36.760
Oh, my God.

54:31.855 --> 54:33.931
Did you sleep at all?

54:39.237 --> 54:42.736
- Is it getting worse?
- What?

54:42.736 --> 54:44.865
The marks on your skin.

54:46.870 --> 54:50.320
When I looked in that light,
I couldn't stand for ten minutes.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.823
Who knows what it did to us?

54:57.880 --> 54:59.160
To our bodies.

55:09.307 --> 55:14.052
You remember that first moment when you
saw it, when it completely took over?

55:14.979 --> 55:18.182
Somehow you... you still felt...

55:22.444 --> 55:24.520
...powerful.

55:30.452 --> 55:32.528
I still do.

56:47.941 --> 56:50.693
Why don't you take a seat, relax?

57:02.663 --> 57:08.499
All right, I will bite. What's your plan,
boss? I know you're dying to tell me.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.078
Nothing to say?

57:14.299 --> 57:16.173
We're sitting on the marina
for Christ's sakes.

57:16.173 --> 57:17.374
I have noticed that.

57:17.374 --> 57:19.544
There are hundreds of boats
right across the street.

57:19.544 --> 57:21.547
We have been through all this.

57:21.547 --> 57:23.762
Remind us
how that worked out last time.

57:29.939 --> 57:31.730
We go quietly this time.

57:31.730 --> 57:34.390
And search every boat
till we find the key?

57:34.390 --> 57:37.604
- If we have to.
- Great plan, Jarrod.

57:38.739 --> 57:42.072
I can't believe you'd even suggest that
after what happened.

57:42.072 --> 57:44.733
You make it sound like it was my fault.

57:44.733 --> 57:49.822
I was practically begging,
but you wouldn't listen.

57:50.625 --> 57:53.329
And you think Terry
would have listened to me?

57:56.130 --> 57:58.206
All right.

57:59.425 --> 58:02.628
Let's say we make it
out of the building,

58:02.628 --> 58:06.468
across the marina, down the dock,
we even find the boat and everything.

58:06.468 --> 58:08.514
Then what?

58:08.514 --> 58:13.179
- Then we get the hell out of Dodge.
- Where to? Carolina? Down the coast?

58:13.179 --> 58:16.272
- Anywhere is better than here.
- How do you know?

58:16.272 --> 58:20.058
We're here. We're alive.

58:22.613 --> 58:24.689
What was that?

58:26.534 --> 58:28.656
What do you see?

58:34.917 --> 58:36.541
Hallelujah.

59:51.030 --> 59:53.271
Come on, come on, come on.

01:00:10.421 --> 01:00:12.499
Everybody get down.

01:00:36.614 --> 01:00:38.274
Jarrod?

01:00:38.274 --> 01:00:39.114
Lainey?

01:01:42.759 --> 01:01:43.790
It worked.

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:53.350
I don't believe it. Is it over?

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:55.642
It worked. It worked.

01:01:55.642 --> 01:01:59.016
- Do you mind?
- By all means, boss.

01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:11.076
Do you think there are
more planes where they came from?

01:02:11.076 --> 01:02:16.914
Yes. Now they know what to do,
they will be sending help in no time.

01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:29.458
What?

01:02:31.097 --> 01:02:33.800
- What is it?
- They're not dead.

01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:39.228
They're just really, really pissed off.

01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:06.620
Something is happening.

01:03:19.892 --> 01:03:22.264
We got to cover these windows.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:25.428
Come help me with this.

01:03:25.428 --> 01:03:29.105
- Get back over here.
- Look, I will find something.

01:03:35.448 --> 01:03:36.907
Here.

01:03:43.706 --> 01:03:46.411
Jarrod, what are you doing?

01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:48.659
The only thing we can do.

01:03:55.843 --> 01:03:58.214
What's this really about, huh?

01:03:59.178 --> 01:04:01.255
Those things are coming for us.

01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:06.056
You think I haven't noticed
that mess under your shirt?

01:04:06.056 --> 01:04:09.347
We stay here and hold up for good.

01:04:10.439 --> 01:04:12.598
I agree.

01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:17.152
Now he gets to decide everything?
We have no water, no power.

01:04:17.152 --> 01:04:19.194
Yeah, but you saw what's out there.

01:04:19.194 --> 01:04:23.148
Yeah, and I would rather make a run
for it than stay in a 20-storey target.

01:04:23.148 --> 01:04:27.027
Between those things and the radiation,
we are dead up here.

01:04:38.757 --> 01:04:40.251
Go. Go.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.667
Go, go, go, go. Cover the flanks.

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:44.837
Look.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.722
- Get off me.
- What do you think you're doing?

01:04:46.722 --> 01:04:49.297
- We have to let them know we're here.
- We will let everything know.

01:04:49.297 --> 01:04:52.393
You have been saying to wait for help.
Well, help is here.

01:04:53.688 --> 01:04:58.100
Does that look like a rescue chopper
to you? Don't you get it? We're at war.

01:05:00.194 --> 01:05:02.270
Where are they going?

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:12.535
Those choppers are coming back for them.
We have to go. Come on.

01:05:18.336 --> 01:05:19.914
We will get to the roof.
They will pick us up.

01:05:19.914 --> 01:05:23.207
What if they don't come back?
Look what happened to those planes.

01:05:23.207 --> 01:05:25.790
- What good is a helicopter?
- We have to take a chance.

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:30.262
A chance? They just nuked the city.
And you want to wave hello?

01:05:30.262 --> 01:05:33.218
Seriously, you need to back off.
We have to...

01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:36.052
Oh, shit.

01:05:36.812 --> 01:05:38.140
You just going to stand there?

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.809
What happens when the rest of the blinds
fall? We don't have enough bed sheets.

01:05:43.693 --> 01:05:46.184
- Come on.
- How can you be so sure?

01:05:46.184 --> 01:05:48.022
Let's just go.

01:05:48.022 --> 01:05:50.190
You're in no condition
to decide anything.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:52.692
Who knows what side you're on?

01:05:52.692 --> 01:05:54.114
I am warning you...

01:05:54.114 --> 01:05:57.536
Stop it, both of you.

01:05:57.536 --> 01:06:01.040
Look at his face. He's sick.

01:06:03.545 --> 01:06:06.499
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Oh, don't worry.

01:06:16.891 --> 01:06:19.429
I am not leaving here without my family.

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:25.345
And there is nothing
that you can do to stop us.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.561
Lainey, you have to trust me.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.413
It's me.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.918
It's still... me.

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:03.967
I know.

01:07:08.481 --> 01:07:10.556
We have to go.

01:07:14.445 --> 01:07:16.521
He's going to get her killed.

01:07:18.324 --> 01:07:20.399
Come on.

01:07:38.843 --> 01:07:40.123
Come on.

01:07:51.271 --> 01:07:53.809
All right, let's go.

01:08:10.455 --> 01:08:11.700
You see anything?

01:08:16.545 --> 01:08:18.620
Right there.

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:24.876
- Hey. Help.
- Help us.

01:08:24.876 --> 01:08:26.760
- Don't move.
- Don't shoot.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.879
No, no, wait. We need help. Please.

01:09:29.446 --> 01:09:30.526
Oh, no, no.

01:09:33.075 --> 01:09:33.825
No.

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:00.888
- Hey. Yeah.
- Hey.

01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:01.888
Hey.

01:10:05.062 --> 01:10:09.310
Copy that.
I have got a visual right now.

01:10:09.984 --> 01:10:11.858
Mayday. Mayday.

01:10:32.381 --> 01:10:35.416
- Hang on. We're going down.
- No.

01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:25.879
Oh, my God.

01:11:35.481 --> 01:11:37.557
Come on.

01:11:45.491 --> 01:11:47.946
Get off of me. Get off.

01:11:55.584 --> 01:11:57.659
Go. Go. Go.

01:12:20.023 --> 01:12:23.225
The scaffolding. It's the only
way down. Come on, come on.

01:13:18.244 --> 01:13:19.525
Jarrod.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.663
- Jarrod.
- Elaine, run.

01:15:31.869 --> 01:15:34.954
Vaya con dios, you son of a bitch.

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.880
Help me. Help me.

01:15:50.637 --> 01:15:51.918
Help me.

01:16:48.107 --> 01:16:49.767
Jarrod.

01:16:49.767 --> 01:16:51.935
Look at me.

01:16:51.935 --> 01:16:54.187
Look at me, Jarrod.

01:17:04.289 --> 01:17:07.575
got to get up. Come on.

01:17:42.617 --> 01:17:45.902
Come on. It's our only chance.

01:19:21.334 --> 01:19:25.628
Lainey, please. You have to go.

01:19:28.132 --> 01:19:30.505
I am not going anywhere without you.

01:23:12.218 --> 01:23:13.877
Jarrod.

01:24:58.567 --> 01:25:00.109
My baby.

01:26:19.726 --> 01:26:21.802
Jarrod.
