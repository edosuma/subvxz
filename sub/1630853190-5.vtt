WEBVTT

00:14.048 --> 00:15.383
That was "Careless Whisper"

00:15.483 --> 00:18.052
by the innumerable
George Michael.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.154
That's not
what "innumerable" means.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.323
Oh, yes, it is.
On Brother's Day,

00:22.423 --> 00:25.526
we only say nice things
to Spencer.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.895
So yes, that was
definitely George Michael.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.697
Isn't that right, guys?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.099
- Obviously.
- Of course!

00:31.199 --> 00:32.600
Innumerably!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.802
You're a regular Kenny G.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.904
Or a regular Craig Saunders.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.707
Y'all don't know him. We went
to boarding school together.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.009
But he could shred on the sax.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.611
I went to boarding school.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.115
You know, my mom played Kenny G
to me in the womb.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.783
She read that playing
smooth jazz to a baby in utero

00:49.883 --> 00:51.985
is supposed to make them
come out gifted.

00:52.086 --> 00:55.856
With that?
The gift of being lame?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.926
Cut it out.
Be nice to Pearl.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.894
'Cause she's my perfect
little cupcake.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.830
You're my perfect
little jellybean.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.999
-We're the worst.
-The worst!

01:06.100 --> 01:08.536
Yeah. You really do suck.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.041
I thought you really
liked Pearl.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.809
What changed, Milli Vanill?

01:15.909 --> 01:18.011
Look, I only trust her
as far as I can throw her,

01:18.112 --> 01:21.715
which is not very far because
I'm 11 and she's at least 52.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.090
Thank you all for being here.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.526
And a special thanks
to my girl Tootsie.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.196
It's just too bad she's only
allowed out once a year.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.764
'Cause of my brass allergy.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.867
Ugh, so frustrating.
You're so talented!

01:41.769 --> 01:45.806
So, everyone, raise
your OJ and beer "man-mosas."

01:45.906 --> 01:47.408
To Spencer.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.076
This drink is sweet
and makes no sense.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.411
Just like you.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.147
-Thank you.
-To Spencer!

01:53.247 --> 01:54.515
Ah, thanks, sis.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.484
I'm honored to be
your big brother.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.519
Did I make sacrifices?
Sure.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.088
So I never backpacked
through Europe

02:01.189 --> 02:02.923
or finished law school

02:03.023 --> 02:05.859
or toured with
the U.S. cast of Stomp.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.462
And maybe in a different world
where I wasn't a surrogate dad

02:08.562 --> 02:11.965
to Carly, I'd have settled down
by now with my one true love.

02:12.065 --> 02:16.103
Yet, a thousand meaningless
one night stands later,

02:16.204 --> 02:18.739
I'm all alone.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.608
But, hey, Carly's doing great.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.247
Happy Brother's Day.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.717
Happy Brother's Day.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.686
I feel so guilty knowing
that I held Spencer back

03:05.786 --> 03:07.120
from finding true love.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.522
Don't blame yourself.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.124
Your brother's an idiot.
Nice place, though.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.194
What if I hire
a really expensive

03:14.295 --> 03:15.463
matchmaker for Spencer?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.365
Oh, that's a terrible idea.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.033
What if I already hired
a really expensive matchmaker

03:20.133 --> 03:22.470
to help Spencer,
and I can't get my deposit back?

03:22.570 --> 03:25.639
Then yay! Best sister ever!

03:25.739 --> 03:28.642
Her name is McKenna Donatacci.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.043
And apparently,
she's on this show called...

03:30.143 --> 03:32.446
-Code Red Flags.
-Code Red Flags?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.382
You hired the host
of Code Red Flags

03:34.482 --> 03:35.483
to find Spencer a match?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.418
-Do you know her?
-Uh, yeah!

03:37.518 --> 03:38.719
J'obsessed.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.488
I've seen every single episode.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.155
I even submitted
an audition tape

03:42.256 --> 03:44.024
once or twice or 17 times.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.396
She says that every single guy
is either one of two things,

03:48.496 --> 03:50.831
a Red Flag or a Mr. Cool Guy.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.500
What's a Mr. Cool Guy?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.768
It's her prototype
for the perfect guy.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.271
Frosted tips,
tasteful choker,

03:57.371 --> 04:00.207
and tattoos in a language
he does not speak.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.777
-Oh, my God!

04:06.547 --> 04:09.049
Hi, McKenna. I'm Carly.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.051
And I'm Carly's roommate,
Harper. Huge, huge fan!

04:11.151 --> 04:12.820
Can I try on your shoes?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.222
In your mind you can.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.393
So, Carly,
before I fix up your brother,

04:19.493 --> 04:22.029
I need to make sure
there are no... red flags.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.166
Now, there are three
in particular that every man

04:26.266 --> 04:27.735
should avoid.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.803
Red flag number one:
no roommates.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.239
If he still splits the rent,
she shall not consent.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.674
'Cause that's a red flag, y'all.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.577
I love it when she says it.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.046
Well, Spencer owns
this very apartment,

04:39.146 --> 04:40.448
so one for one.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.416
Red flag number two:

04:42.516 --> 04:43.784
Height.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.253
One should just be tall.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.522
If you're under five nine,
don't waste my time,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.190
'cause that's
a red flag, bitch!

04:51.425 --> 04:54.595
"Be tall." It seems
like a hard rule to follow.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.096
But Spencer does.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.066
And red flag number three
is immaturity.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.001
See, women want
a man who's confident,

05:01.101 --> 05:03.871
but doesn't demand attention
at all times.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.407
If he acts like a baby,
it's not even a maybe.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.042
'Sup?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.579
Oh, uh, Spencer!
Your bonnet?

05:11.679 --> 05:14.214
Uh, Carly, your face?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.951
Spencer. Hi, McKenna Donatacci,
professional matchmaker

05:18.051 --> 05:19.720
with an extremely
high success rate,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.655
and owner of four cars.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.859
Mm. You're helping Harper?
She's single, and has no cars.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.830
Spencer! Don't tell McKenna
I have no cars.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.434
This is my gift to you.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.902
You said
you hadn't met the one.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.070
Uh, I don't really
have trouble getting ladies,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.507
but if it makes
you happy, Carly,

05:39.607 --> 05:42.776
I'll go out on multiple dates
with beautiful women.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.179
Just no Caitlins.
I'm so done with Caitlins.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.085
Finally, we can catch up
on The Good Fight.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.354
Hey, you didn't watch
any episodes without me, right?

05:54.455 --> 05:57.491
No. But I might've had
a dream with exact plot

05:57.591 --> 05:59.427
of the next three episodes.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.761
Oh, you are the worst liar.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.863
-You're the worst liar.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.698
So, what are we thinking
for dinner?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.299
Lamb chops or spaghetti?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.801
Oh, Pearl doesn't eat meat,
so...

06:07.901 --> 06:09.803
Lamb chops it is.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.306
Great. So now you're gonna
bully my girlfriend too?

06:13.407 --> 06:14.875
I smell a rat.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.910
Mm. You've been talking
with Millicent, haven't you?

06:17.010 --> 06:19.012
Yep. And if our
little Milli Vanill

06:19.112 --> 06:20.881
doesn't trust Pearl,
then neither do I.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.383
She's the first woman
you've seriously dated

06:23.484 --> 06:25.052
since adopting Millicent.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.587
I'm just looking out for her.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.388
Who, Pearl?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.057
No! Millicent.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.894
Not that mousy-haired barnacle
you scraped off a crab trap.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.067
She... saw me, right?

06:40.167 --> 06:43.036
I'm sorry. She and Millicent
are struggling to get used to me

06:43.136 --> 06:44.838
being in a real relationship.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.206
They somehow figured out
a way to make sure

06:46.306 --> 06:48.476
that I only get
male Uber drivers.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.211
Look, as long as you're living
under your mother's roof,

06:51.311 --> 06:53.180
she is gonna treat you
like a child.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.181
Uh...

06:54.281 --> 06:56.684
Just my opinion.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.752
She does not treat me
like a child.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.621
Babykins, you want
your lamb chops cubed

07:00.721 --> 07:04.057
and not touching anything else
on the plate, like always?

07:04.157 --> 07:06.827
My food can touch.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.735
Oh. Are we sad eating
or sex eating?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.436
Can't help but notice
the two plates

07:16.537 --> 07:18.472
and the zero underwear.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.811
I have met the lady
of my dreams.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.679
She's intelligent,
she's funny.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.048
I'm pretty sure
she has two tongues.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.584
I'm sorry I doubted you, sis.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.385
You were so right
to hire McKenna.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.855
So, who is my future
sister-in-law?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.290
Morning!

07:37.390 --> 07:38.759
Oh, hey, McKenna.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.829
Whoa! Spencer has
that same robe.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.439
Good morning, beautiful.
How was your shower?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.341
-Did you miss me?
-We're not there yet.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.276
Yet!

07:57.044 --> 08:00.080
Your coffee.
You get my special Carly mug.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.582
Oh. Ah, look at that.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.050
She's on both sides.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.952
And the bottom.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.888
Well, it's my turn to shower.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.823
Hopefully, you left me
some strands of hair

08:09.923 --> 08:12.726
stuck to the wall.
Mwah!

08:16.564 --> 08:18.732
We want details.
Tell us everything.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.134
Yes. Tell me more,
tell me more.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.335
Like did he have a car?

08:22.435 --> 08:23.971
Are you quoting Grease?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.706
I just feel very uncomfortable
right now.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.710
Oh, well,
you know how it goes.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.211
I said I liked his art.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.114
He said, "Then you'll like
my body even more."

08:34.214 --> 08:35.415
I said, "Never say that again."

08:35.515 --> 08:37.050
And then we had sex.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.553
Look. Please don't tell anyone
about this.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.388
A matchmaker should never
sleep with her client.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.692
Aw. And I shouldn't have slept
with that lady at the library.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.561
But she was hot.
And very quiet.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.831
This is
so unprofessional of me.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.233
Spencer's not even
the type I go for.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.936
Well, what's wrong
with my brother?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.906
I mean, it's not every day
you meet a Spencer Shay.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.881
Brass allergy.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.989
Guess who found
the coolest fedora?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.491
Or I can save that story

09:18.592 --> 09:20.661
for when whatever this is
blows over.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.997
We know how much you like Pearl,
but we thought it would help

09:24.097 --> 09:26.099
to get the whole picture.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.705
We've done a deep dive
on Pearl,

09:31.805 --> 09:35.108
and trust me, the world
does not seem to be her oyster.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.410
I have it on good authority

09:37.510 --> 09:39.579
that she claps
when the plane lands.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.416
She orders ice cream in a cone,
then asks for a cup.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.886
Okay, Princess Diana.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.857
And I've seen her eat a banana
without peeling it first.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.059
Oh, so you're not
just bullying Pearl,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.361
you're spying on her, too?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.363
Peel and all?
Is it even ripe?

09:56.463 --> 09:57.665
Don't blame Millicent.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.199
This was all my idea.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.702
I'm gonna go polish
your old fencing trophies.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.604
That always helps me
blow off steam.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.177
Millicent, now that
my app's taken off,

10:10.277 --> 10:13.080
your old dad has a little
extra lettuce in his crisper.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.582
I think it's time we look
for a new place.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.118
I do not think so.
Good talk, though.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.054
And that's why
I'll be paying rent.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.790
So I'm the one
making the decisions.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.760
From now on,
just call me Rent Daddy.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.495
Never.
We can't move.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.664
I hung a poster.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.900
-Millicent...
-With a nail!

10:33.967 --> 10:36.303
A unit just opened up
in The Windham.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.138
Look at this.
Three bedrooms,

10:38.238 --> 10:39.973
two bathrooms with Jacuzzis,

10:40.073 --> 10:43.476
and Bette Midler's niece
lives in the penthouse.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.880
And this...
would be your room.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.718
The view from my bedroom

10:50.818 --> 10:52.552
is literally the one
on this poster.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.121
I know!

10:54.221 --> 10:55.889
We need
a fresh start, kiddo,

10:55.989 --> 10:58.491
somewhere to put down roots.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.861
Okay.
Let's do this.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.362
All right!
Let's do this!

11:02.462 --> 11:03.797
But I do have one request.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.899
- What's that?
- Dump Pearl.

11:05.999 --> 11:06.767
No.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.801
But even monkeys know

11:07.901 --> 11:09.737
you peel the banana first.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.743
McKenna said she wants
to keep things between us

11:15.843 --> 11:17.911
"strictly business."

11:18.011 --> 11:20.547
That it was a one night stand
and nothing more.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.183
I feel so used.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.618
Cool, but used.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.856
I've never seen you like this.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.863
I am indeed... forlorn.

11:36.663 --> 11:40.233
Well, maybe McKenna just needs
to see you in a different light.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.735
What, like dusk?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.370
That's when bats come out,
and I cannot be chill

11:43.470 --> 11:45.405
if I know they're up there.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.840
You know her type.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.976
- What, a Mr. Cool Guy?
- What's a Mr. Cool Guy?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.812
It's how she dresses all
the guys on Code Red Flags.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.381
Like a guy who gives off
a club promoter vibe

11:54.481 --> 11:55.983
even at the grocery store.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.586
If we turn Spencer
into a Mr. Cool Guy,

11:59.686 --> 12:01.321
he'll be irresistible
to McKenna.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.024
You really think
this could work?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.693
Yes, I do.
And so should you.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.428
Now, all hands in on three.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.830
One. Two. Three.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.065
- Makeover!
- Mr. Cool Guy!
- Yippee!

12:12.165 --> 12:14.301
We probably should've
gone over it before.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.608
Hey.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.576
Freddie!

12:23.676 --> 12:25.879
This gift is almost
as good as those vintage

12:25.979 --> 12:28.448
toenail clippers you got me
for my birthday.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.682
Wait, what gift?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.551
A son moving his mother

12:31.651 --> 12:33.320
into a luxury
high-rise building?

12:33.420 --> 12:37.690
The ladies in my book club
are fuming with jealousy.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.660
Danica bit her wine glass
in two.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.831
I filled Grandma B in

12:43.931 --> 12:45.833
on all the details
about our new apartment.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.069
Including the Jacuzzi jets.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.006
You know you've made it
when your tub purrs.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.176
Bacterial nightmare,
but what a flex!

12:57.710 --> 13:00.113
I'm sorry, Mom.
Millicent misunderstood.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.915
It's just the two of us
moving into The Windham.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.118
- Oh, you and me?
- Ooh. Mom, no.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.887
Me and Millicent.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.555
But there are three bedrooms.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.757
Yes, one for you,
one for me, one for--

13:10.858 --> 13:12.725
Let me guess. Pearl.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.795
No. My office.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.765
Our office.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.334
I'll just use the kitchen.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.970
There it is.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.738
Maybe you're not
thinking clearly.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.908
Did you go number two today?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.478
You get so cranky
when your pipes are clogged.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.247
No, Mom.
This is the decision

13:34.347 --> 13:36.616
that's right for me
and my daughter.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.319
I can't be
your little boy forever.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.353
I'm a Rent Daddy now.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.092
Oh, Mom, come on!

13:45.192 --> 13:49.196
There's no way that means
what he think it means.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.703
McKenna.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.838
I am about
to change your life.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.440
My life is perfect.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.109
Come in anyway.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.045
This better be worth it.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.915
I just left lunch with a man
who's seven foot five.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.717
Oh, it will be.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.420
May we present to you...

14:13.520 --> 14:17.157
Mr. Cool Guy.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.868
'Sup?

14:29.469 --> 14:32.172
Oh. Is that every member
of Entourage I see?

14:32.272 --> 14:35.775
Oh, no. That is actually
your dream man.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.946
And, incidentally,
my brother Spencer Shay.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.416
Spencer?
Are you in there?

14:44.684 --> 14:45.818
I think so.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.657
Note the skin-tight jeans,
the sole dangly earring,

14:50.757 --> 14:52.425
the deepest of V-necks.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.395
Behold the V.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.367
Isn't he everything
you ever wanted and more?

15:01.768 --> 15:02.970
Wow.

15:03.070 --> 15:07.874
This is easily,
without a doubt,

15:07.975 --> 15:10.910
the biggest red flag
I have ever seen!

15:22.389 --> 15:23.823
What do you mean,
I'm a red flag?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.059
Put your two tongues
in my mouth and tell me that.

15:26.159 --> 15:31.031
Look, normally, I would crawl
through that frosted-tip tundra

15:31.131 --> 15:32.665
on my hands and knees.

15:32.765 --> 15:37.604
But, people, he let his sister
do a makeover on him!

15:37.704 --> 15:39.706
Who is she talking to?

15:40.807 --> 15:43.610
It's classic codependence,
which is a big no-no,

15:43.710 --> 15:46.579
as I say in my book,
Be Like This, Not Like That,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.681
available wherever
books are sold.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.850
Oh, that reminds me.
We need to go to the bookstore.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.685
The new spooky stories
are coming out tonight.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.022
And we can read them under
the covers with a flashlight.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.090
Ooh, don't tell me the ending.
No spoilers.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.126
So, don't you find it weird

15:59.226 --> 16:00.627
that you guys live
in the same building?

16:00.727 --> 16:01.961
Weird? I mean, it's not like

16:02.062 --> 16:04.131
- we live in the same apartment.
- Anymore.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.899
Mm-hmm. And don't you have
the same friend group?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.002
Well, sure. There's Carly's
roommate Harper,

16:09.102 --> 16:10.637
my neighbor Freddie,
Freddie's daughter--

16:10.737 --> 16:12.605
Ooh, Freddie's mother.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.542
I guess most of our friends
are in this building.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.711
- Ooh, ooh, and... Wait, water?
- No, thank you.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.548
Tell her your names
in each other's phones.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.452
Sister Daughter.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.820
- Brother Father.
- Mm.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.889
You're right.
We're like two globs

16:29.989 --> 16:32.525
of tapioca at the bottom
of a boba tea.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.960
Delicious.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.895
Impossible to separate.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.200
Fixed it. I now put her
in my phone as Honey Sister.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.004
I promise. You'll still see us
all the time, Grandma B.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.574
I can even send you videos
of Dad sleeping.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.009
Oh, don't worry.
I already set up a nanny cam.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.412
But I'll tell you a secret.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.714
I might miss you even more
than Freddie.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.016
Just don't tell him.
He'll be crushed.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.623
Millicent, um,
I have some bad news.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.126
You're back to finish
that fedora story?

17:06.926 --> 17:09.062
It actually has a juicy twist.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.632
Our application was denied.
We're not moving.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.434
I think the best thing
for our family

17:14.534 --> 17:16.836
is to be
with our whole family.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.673
Long live the Bensons!

17:21.441 --> 17:23.376
-No. Just the Bensons.
-Oh...

17:23.476 --> 17:24.377
What... No.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.313
Stop! Stop it!

17:26.413 --> 17:29.516
For the last time,
Pearl is a part of my life,

17:29.616 --> 17:31.618
which means that
she is a part of yours, too.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.786
So get with it or...

17:33.886 --> 17:36.856
Actually, no "or."
End of sentence.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.293
Freddie, I've never seen you
so assertive before.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.528
Say more things like that.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.331
Watch this.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.434
Mom, if Millicent and I are
going to stay here,

17:47.534 --> 17:49.336
then I insist
on paying the rent,

17:49.436 --> 17:52.305
but you have to start
treating me like an adult--

17:52.405 --> 17:55.808
nay, a Rent Daddy.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.511
Ugh!

17:58.611 --> 18:00.147
Hey, Millicent,
here's a thought.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.150
How about we turn your poster
into life-size wallpaper?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.418
That way you can still have
your waterfront view.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.919
I can help.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.957
Not a bad idea, Pearl.
Not bad at all.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.825
Want to go get tacos
with me and Dad?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.128
You can even sit
at the same table as us.

18:15.228 --> 18:18.097
I'd love that.
Millicent Vanillicent.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.966
Don't try to do
your own thing.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.036
Come on, gals.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.508
Ugh.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.042
With all the money
I'm saving in rent,

18:30.143 --> 18:32.512
I bet I can get Pearl
on that no-fly list.

18:32.612 --> 18:37.584
We'll see if she likes to clap
as the bus pulls into the depot.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.025
Maybe we need some space
from each other.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.396
One of us could
move out of the building.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.332
Yeah, one of us could.
Maybe you?

18:52.432 --> 18:55.101
Sure. Yeah.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.603
Why me, though?

18:56.703 --> 18:57.904
Well, you rent. I own.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.339
And with the market
the way it is--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.107
Oh, don't you talk to me
about the market, okay?

19:01.208 --> 19:03.109
- I know all about the market.
- I know

19:03.210 --> 19:05.512
- all about the market!
- Forget about the market.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.314
McKenna Donatacci is leaving.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.849
My problematic angel.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.819
Look, as long
as you two are enmeshed,

19:12.919 --> 19:14.187
Spencer will never have

19:14.287 --> 19:15.788
a meaningful relationship
with a woman.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.490
Trust me.
I wrote the rules.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.560
Which you can hear about on
Trust Me, I Wrote the Rules,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.263
available wherever
you get your podcasts.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.800
Now, hold on a second.

19:30.002 --> 19:34.807
McKenna, you may be a gorgeous,
wealthy, best-selling author

19:34.907 --> 19:37.544
and TV personality
with a beautiful smile

19:37.644 --> 19:39.812
and illustrious hair...

19:40.580 --> 19:42.181
But?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.883
Yeah, and a great butt.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.653
But you're wrong.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.987
Maybe I haven't had

19:48.087 --> 19:49.756
a meaningful
romantic relationship,

19:49.856 --> 19:52.992
but I raised the best woman
I know, my sister.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.329
Aw, Spence.
I feel seen.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.301
And if Carly really is
a "helicopter sister,"

20:01.401 --> 20:04.904
well, then,
I'm the pilot inside of her.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.308
Babe, no.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.078
But what about all the things
you said on Brother's Day

20:12.178 --> 20:14.447
about me getting in the way
of you settling down?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.884
Carly, I chose to spend
those years raising you.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.386
I don't regret one day of it.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.954
Besides, I was five
"man-mosas" deep at brunch.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.256
I could've said anything.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.958
Like my real age,
which, again, is 32.

20:27.126 --> 20:30.229
- Yeah. 32.
- Mm.

20:32.299 --> 20:35.868
Oh. Sorry, uh,
two siblings hugging

20:35.968 --> 20:38.104
a little weird for you?

20:41.774 --> 20:45.077
Why is McKenna Donatacci crying?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.781
I'm sorry.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.150
I'm sorry,
it's just so beautiful.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.853
I wish I had a relationship
like yours,

20:53.953 --> 20:57.223
but none of my 11 brothers
will talk to me

20:57.324 --> 20:59.926
because I call
all my nieces ugly.

21:00.026 --> 21:03.262
What? I tell it like it is!

21:04.464 --> 21:06.466
Well, I'm sure
you can patch things up.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.935
Open communication?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.270
That's a green flag, chica.

21:11.371 --> 21:15.074
True, although
I don't love the optics

21:15.174 --> 21:17.777
of you saying "chica."

21:17.877 --> 21:20.279
But thank you.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.282
So...

21:23.383 --> 21:25.051
Spencer...

21:25.151 --> 21:27.387
all dolled up
with nowhere to go?

21:27.487 --> 21:33.826
Tell me, have you ever
made love in a gondola?

21:35.428 --> 21:36.863
No.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.031
Yet another thing I missed out
on because of Carly.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.671
Popcorn, anybody?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.773
Oh, we're good, thanks.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.615
Mm.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.520
What are you guys watching?

22:00.620 --> 22:02.989
It's Code Red Flags.
McKenna is roasting all of us.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.624
Is it weird
that I'm kind of excited

22:04.724 --> 22:06.225
to hear
what she says about me?

22:06.325 --> 22:09.929
Carly Shay? She is not well.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.732
Sincerely.
Get help, girl.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.802
I didn't even get a rhyme?

22:17.437 --> 22:18.871
Well, at least
you didn't get red flagged.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.407
Yeah.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.009
And now, for this week's
eligible bachelorette.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.312
Please welcome...
Harper.

Hi. I'm Harper.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.282
I'm a stylist from Seattle.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.719
I'm mind your business
years old.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.154
And if your shirt
has a team logo,

22:35.254 --> 22:38.591
then, baby, it's a no-go.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.827
And how tall are you?

22:40.927 --> 22:43.396
Six foot one.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.004
What?
She said, "Be tall."

23:20.433 --> 23:22.334
Ooh!

23:22.435 --> 23:24.637
He hates these cans.
