WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.969
FLEMING: Back then,
I was sharp enough

00:03.003 --> 00:03.937
to stick in the ground

00:03.969 --> 00:04.805
and green enough to grow.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.839
(audience laughs)

00:05.872 --> 00:07.307
FLEMING: I said yes
to everything.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.109
So they had me, you see.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.077
There was nothing I could do.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.613
At this point in my career,

00:12.646 --> 00:14.981
I was just an overworked
prosecutor grunt.

00:15.015 --> 00:15.682
You know the feeling?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.019
Now this is long,
long before I became

00:19.052 --> 00:21.622
the esteemed
Chief Judge Fleming,

00:21.655 --> 00:23.724
winner of the State Bar
Association's

00:23.757 --> 00:25.325
Lifetime Achievement Award,

00:25.358 --> 00:26.660
I'll take that.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.995
(crowd applauding)

00:29.029 --> 00:30.797
FLEMING: Am I being
humble enough?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.165
No, no, in fact,

00:32.198 --> 00:35.636
I am quite honored.

00:35.669 --> 00:36.336
I'm sorry.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.839
DONNELL: You emptied
the four bottles at your table?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.306
Practically by myself.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.075
Just a bunch of sippers.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.811
HATCHER: Hey, do you guys
have some gift bags over there?

00:44.845 --> 00:46.880
Lucy, I said
you could have mine.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.582
Hey...

00:48.615 --> 00:51.652
firm springs for a table
and nobody invites me?

00:51.685 --> 00:52.719
Shh.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.722
Oh, that's right,
Judge Fleming.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.191
I forgot what a big deal
he was to you.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.226
You know, I like him
even better off the bench.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.995
I'm just trying to listen.

01:02.028 --> 01:04.598
FLEMING: This is the room
that would be perfect

01:04.631 --> 01:06.366
for his office.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.433
Now, mind you,

01:07.467 --> 01:08.401
it's the middle of the summer,

01:08.434 --> 01:09.770
but here I am

01:09.803 --> 01:12.305
helping the Chief Justice
of the United States

01:12.338 --> 01:13.239
move furniture.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.508
I'm sweating buckets.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.511
I mean, I'm pushing this--
I'm talking huge...

01:17.544 --> 01:19.112
Let's talk about Cassell.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.480
Um, tomorrow in court.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.882
Now, I know you think

01:21.915 --> 01:24.851
the Cassell case hinges
on consent, but--

01:24.885 --> 01:25.786
You're in no shape

01:25.819 --> 01:27.453
to argue this tonight,
counselor.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.989
FRUTT: Can you two
take it outside?

01:29.022 --> 01:30.390
Very good idea.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.457
Bob...

01:32.225 --> 01:34.127
your client is a bad man.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.396
He deserves to be in jail.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.799
I'm not letting him
back out on the street.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.967
Maybe not, but you're gonna
buy me a new tie.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.135
I mean it.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.937
I can see that. Shh.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.139
You're not taking me seriously.

01:46.172 --> 01:48.408
This is gonna go to trial,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.143
and, buddy, I'm gonna win.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.412
Ah! Oh!

01:52.445 --> 01:55.448
(laughing)

02:03.389 --> 02:05.526
(music playing)

02:54.274 --> 02:55.341
GAMBLE: At which time
you arrived

02:55.375 --> 02:56.476
at the defendant's house?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.545
CHEN: Yes. Correct.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.412
Now, Officer Chen,

02:59.445 --> 03:01.648
can you describe
what transpired?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.551
I knocked on the door,
announced my presence.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.019
And Cassell's
girlfriend answered,

03:06.052 --> 03:07.754
said he wasn't home.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.856
I requested permission
to search the premises,

03:09.890 --> 03:13.459
and she--the girlfriend,
granted my request.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.596
I did a protective sweep
of the common area,

03:15.629 --> 03:17.731
then I heard someone

03:17.764 --> 03:18.999
talking down the hall.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.134
And at that point...

03:21.167 --> 03:22.736
I approached the room
with my weapon drawn,

03:22.769 --> 03:24.470
pushed open the door,
and entered.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.139
Was anyone inside?

03:26.172 --> 03:28.108
No, it was the TV.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.510
"politically incorrect."

03:29.543 --> 03:30.911
but right there in the corner

03:30.944 --> 03:32.713
in plain sight
was a box filled

03:32.746 --> 03:33.980
with plastic-wrapped bricks

03:34.014 --> 03:37.984
of what appeared to be
narcotics--cocaine.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.753
You say you heard
the television.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.454
I heard someone talking.

03:41.487 --> 03:42.823
I thought it might be
the defendant.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
Did you hear anything else,
a band playing,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.661
laughter from an audience?
Just talking.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.295
You opened the door,
and this is where you saw

03:49.329 --> 03:50.096
the television.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.464
No, it turned out to be coming

03:51.497 --> 03:52.165
from the next room.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.567
DONNELL: So there was no talking

03:53.600 --> 03:55.101
from this room after all?

03:55.135 --> 03:56.436
No.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.171
DONNELL: And yet you still
saw fit to enter the room

03:58.204 --> 04:00.206
and continue your search?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.275
The box was right there.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.744
DONNELL: And you say
it was Mr. Cassell's girlfriend

04:03.777 --> 04:05.078
who consented
to your search?

04:05.111 --> 04:06.079
That's right.

04:06.112 --> 04:07.548
Where is the girlfriend?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.349
I would think she'd be here.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.351
She hasn't come forward.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.686
We can't find her.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.255
No further questions,
Your Honor.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.690
The witness may step down.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.094
Your Honor, move to suppress
due to the fact that my client

04:21.127 --> 04:22.462
was denied his fourth
amendment rights.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.164
Officer Chen had no right
to search the--

04:24.197 --> 04:26.299
Your Honor,
Officer Chen relied

04:26.332 --> 04:28.535
on the girlfriend's
apparent authority to consent.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.804
We deny the girlfriend
ever gave consent.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.239
It's hearsay. We don't stipulate
it ever happened.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.076
Furthermore, Officer Chen's
account of discovering the drugs

04:36.109 --> 04:37.844
is riddled
with contradictions.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.145
GAMBLE: Not true, Your Honor.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.815
Officer Chen testified
he heard talking.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.850
DONNER: He heard the television.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.552
And not even
from the room in question.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.588
GAMBLE: Regardless,
the search of the room

04:47.621 --> 04:49.222
was part
of a protective sweep.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.658
Once inside, the evidence
was in plain sight.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.694
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.028
The fact of the matter is--

04:55.061 --> 04:56.897
FLEMING: Thank you, counsel.
Well argued.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.902
The line between issues
of fact and law here

05:01.935 --> 05:04.170
is a hazy one, is it not?

05:04.204 --> 05:05.305
Your Honor, if I may?

05:05.338 --> 05:07.240
Just speaking
rhetorically, counselor,

05:07.273 --> 05:08.542
if you'll allow me to continue.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.412
I must say,

05:12.445 --> 05:13.780
I'm not entirely certain

05:13.814 --> 05:14.681
that a ruling

05:14.715 --> 05:16.617
would even be appropriate
at this juncture

05:16.650 --> 05:18.118
without the benefit
of additional evidence

05:18.151 --> 05:20.186
that might arise at trial.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.221
I think we could all benefit

05:21.254 --> 05:23.557
from more time.

05:23.590 --> 05:27.027
But the defendant is entitled
to a speedy trial,

05:27.060 --> 05:30.396
and a speedy trial
he shall get.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.465
Accordingly, I'll reserve
my ruling on this matter

05:32.498 --> 05:34.701
while allowing the trial
to go forward.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.169
The clerk will set a date
for jury selection.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.137
We're adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

05:37.170 --> 05:37.838
Your Honor--

05:37.871 --> 05:39.272
Thank you, counsel.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.183
(knocking)

05:50.216 --> 05:50.984
Yeah?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.385
MITCHELL: Helen gamble?

05:52.418 --> 05:53.353
GAMBLE: Yes.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.788
Greg Mitchell,
U. S. Attorney's office.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.324
You guys recruiting
door-to-door these days?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
It's my understanding
Judge Fleming

05:59.392 --> 06:01.027
left the ball in the air
this morning.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.196
You never know
with these suppression issues.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.601
Since when does the U.S.
Attorney's office

06:07.634 --> 06:10.504
take an interest in a state
possession case?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.139
Actually, I can think
of a couple dozen federal cases

06:13.173 --> 06:14.474
we'd like to pawn off on you.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.710
What's this about?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.078
Ms. Gamble,

06:22.048 --> 06:23.584
how well do you know
Judge Fleming?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.821
I've appeared before him
a number of times.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.024
When he was a D. A.,
we all sat in on his trials.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.993
In fact, I was at a dinner
last night honoring--

06:33.026 --> 06:33.927
MITCHELL: We have reason
to believe

06:33.960 --> 06:35.662
Judge Fleming has been
accepting bribes.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.899
Charles Fleming?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.167
Come on.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.369
Now, in this case
that you're handling,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.872
he might eventually admit
the evidence to compensate

06:45.906 --> 06:48.408
for his recent spate
of suppressions and acquittal,

06:48.441 --> 06:49.543
and to check any attention

06:49.576 --> 06:51.044
he might have already
drawn to himself.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.146
And he may admit the evidence

06:53.179 --> 06:56.750
because I established
a valid reason for him to do so.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.953
MITCHELL: Well, with all
due respect, we don't think so.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.354
By reserving his ruling,

07:01.387 --> 07:02.723
he is sending a message

07:02.756 --> 07:05.458
that he is open for a bribe.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.426
This has been his M. O.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.261
in over a dozen cases
that we've reviewed.

07:09.195 --> 07:11.297
It never occurred to you
that he may just prefer

07:11.331 --> 07:13.634
not to make impulsive decisions
from the bench?

07:13.667 --> 07:14.735
We have a witness.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.802
We have a federal prisoner

07:15.836 --> 07:17.070
who's looking to reduce
his sentence

07:17.103 --> 07:18.104
on a robbery conviction.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.405
Well, that's reliable.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.675
MITCHELL: This prisoner says
in a previous case,

07:21.708 --> 07:23.844
his lawyer paid
Judge Fleming five grand

07:23.877 --> 07:24.711
for an acquittal.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.516
And we have evidence
of similar payoffs.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.417
The Department of Justices
been looking at this case

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
for over eight months.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.121
Have you approached any
of the attorneys in those cases,

07:35.155 --> 07:36.857
spoken with anyone upstairs?

07:36.890 --> 07:39.092
No, we're concerned
with tipping off the Judge.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.696
We prefer in these matters
to handle this through a sting.

07:42.729 --> 07:45.799
We create a case,
and then we assign an attorney

07:45.832 --> 07:47.067
who we think
might be involved.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.970
Is that what this is?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.739
You want me to prosecute
a fabricated case?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.510
Actually, Ms. Gamble,

07:56.543 --> 07:57.978
you already are.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.927
DONNELL: What's going on?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.095
Cassell,
what are you doing here?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.129
GAMBLE: Bobby, it's okay.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.197
DONNELL: Like hell it is.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.299
You can't meet with my client
without my approval.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.701
Greg Mitchell, A-USA.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.504
And this is
Agent Donnegan,

08:23.537 --> 08:24.638
FBI.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.039
How you doing, Mr. Donnell?

08:26.472 --> 08:27.273
You're a Fed?

08:27.307 --> 08:28.975
GAMBLE: Same
with my idiot cop, Chen.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.010
I had no idea.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.277
What is this?!

08:31.311 --> 08:34.047
We think Judge Fleming
is on the take.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.849
We've been observing him
for some time now,

08:35.881 --> 08:38.351
and we plan to bring him down
with this trial.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.023
Get out of my office.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.993
You have a very impressive
track record

08:47.027 --> 08:48.261
in front of Judge Fleming.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.164
You think I'm somehow
in on this?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.198
We were suspicious,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.167
but based on your interactions

08:54.200 --> 08:55.168
with Agent Donnegan,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.102
we're no longer targeting you.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.170
You're off the hook.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.071
It's official.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.773
Are you involved in this?!

08:59.806 --> 09:02.442
What? Bobby, no.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.544
I tried to shut this down.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.278
Look, I think
you should at least listen.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.949
MITCHELL: We want you
to offer Judge Fleming a bribe.

09:08.982 --> 09:09.883
Forget it.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.918
Bobby--

09:11.952 --> 09:13.219
can I call you Bobby?

09:13.253 --> 09:16.456
Bobby, you're missing
the bigger picture here.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.725
The office of U. S. Attorney

09:18.759 --> 09:20.426
and the grand jury

09:20.460 --> 09:22.563
have invested
a great deal time and money

09:22.596 --> 09:23.830
in this investigation,

09:23.864 --> 09:26.600
and your cooperation
would greatly valued.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.571
But your failure
to cooperate,

09:30.604 --> 09:33.006
well, that would create
a problem.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.174
And I think
you can appreciate

09:34.207 --> 09:35.208
that we will do everything
that we can

09:35.241 --> 09:36.677
to get you to cooperate.

09:37.511 --> 09:38.912
Are you threatening me?

09:38.945 --> 09:40.747
MITCHELL:
No, I'm stating a fact.

09:40.781 --> 09:44.284
And the fact is that you
may well find yourself--

09:44.317 --> 09:45.251
and this firm

09:45.285 --> 09:48.388
conflicted out of all
superior-court cases

09:48.421 --> 09:50.991
until this investigation
is completed.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.793
And who knows
how long that'll take

09:52.826 --> 09:54.260
without your cooperation

09:54.294 --> 09:57.998
So, if you want
to stay in business,

09:58.031 --> 09:59.232
you're gonna do
whatever we say.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.914
BERLUTI:
What if Fleming's clean?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.282
You offer him a bribe,
he tells you to take a walk.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.318
Now he thinks you're dirty.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.420
FRUTT: Helen would not let Bobby
take the fall.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.122
They'll just have
to suck it up,

10:22.155 --> 10:23.289
tell the Judge
they made a mistake

10:23.323 --> 10:25.325
and that they forced Bobby
to participate.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.061
Fleming is very popular,
and Judges talk.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.363
And there's nothing to stop him
from turning every Judge

10:30.396 --> 10:32.032
on the state
and federal bench

10:32.065 --> 10:32.933
against us.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.601
All our careers
could be over.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.570
FRUTT: If Fleming is dirty

10:36.603 --> 10:39.873
which is doubtful

10:39.906 --> 10:41.374
his friends
are going to resent us

10:41.407 --> 10:42.342
for bringing him down.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.044
Count on it.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.311
WASHINGTON: Don't you think
the majority would be outraged

10:45.345 --> 10:46.647
if he is on the take?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.948
Wouldn't they be glad
we got him?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
You're kidding yourself,
Rebecca.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.818
Operation Graylord
in Chicago?

10:51.852 --> 10:52.853
Judges got busted,

10:52.886 --> 10:54.521
and most of the people
who wore the wires

10:54.555 --> 10:55.388
ended up pariahs.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.857
Because they'd been
on the take

10:56.890 --> 10:59.092
and only set up others
to save themselves.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.994
YOUNG: People will assume
the same about us.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.228
DONNELL: Look...

11:02.262 --> 11:05.131
obviously,
I don't wanna do this.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.434
I agree,
the risk is tremendous.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.571
But I just wonder
if angering the U. S. Attorney

11:10.604 --> 11:12.405
isn't a bigger risk.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.442
Lindsay...

11:19.880 --> 11:22.616
My first jury trial
was in front of Fleming.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.217
It lasted three months.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.720
He was fair, considerate,
more than competent.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.523
I came to like
and admire him very much.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.959
He remains the best Judge
I have ever appeared before.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.695
He has his share
of believers.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.829
I'm one of them, Lindsay.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.263
You can't do this.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.133
Don't let Mitchell use you
like this, or use us.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.935
We're not doing
anything wrong.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.136
I'm not so sure
that matters.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.975
He better be guilty.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.523
This is just like
"Donny Brasco."

12:02.556 --> 12:03.489
Lucy, do you mind?

12:03.524 --> 12:05.792
Actually, Brasco was FBI.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.894
How amazing
was Johnny Depp?

12:08.428 --> 12:09.830
Johnny Depp is an actor.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.898
The real Donnie Brasco
was amazing.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.199
You knew him?!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.334
Can we get on with this?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.937
MITCHELL: Fleming is gonna need
a signal that you want a deal.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.239
So the first thing that you do
in court this morning

12:19.272 --> 12:21.508
is you wave the jury
and you request a bench trial.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.744
I'll have to consult
with my client.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.612
This is how
most defense attorney

12:25.646 --> 12:27.147
seem to be
approaching the Judge.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.883
It shows that you're willing
to put your fate in his hand.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.385
AGENT: Okay. Say something.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.454
You're pissing me off.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.689
Perfect.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.791
Okay, you can button up.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.061
Keep this in your pocket.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.095
When you're ready to record,

12:42.128 --> 12:43.897
click it once
and you're rolling.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.932
DONNELL: How am I getting
through security wearing this?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.635
MITCHELL: You walk through
the detector carrying your keys.

12:48.669 --> 12:49.703
We're gonna have
someone stationed there.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.171
And when the alarm goes off,

12:51.204 --> 12:52.873
you just do what you're told,
and you'll be fine.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.210
(music playing)

13:12.325 --> 13:13.393
(metal detector beeps)

13:13.426 --> 13:14.895
Empty your pockets, please.

13:20.200 --> 13:20.967
Step back through.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.302
(metal detector beeps)

13:23.770 --> 13:24.738
Spread your arms.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.306
GUARD: You take him over there.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.107
Oh, okay.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.112
Spread your arms, sir.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.886
Appreciate it,
you're all set.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.979
Mr. Donnell.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.280
All rise.

14:13.754 --> 14:14.955
BAILIFF: Be seated.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.758
Good morning.

14:17.791 --> 14:18.692
Your honor.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.960
Morning.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.294
You'll forgive my impropriety.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.663
It's a cold one today.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.966
All right, then...

14:25.999 --> 14:29.035
in the matter
of the Commonwealth vs. Cassell,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.336
if there are no
further motions in limine,

14:30.370 --> 14:33.306
I believe we are ready
to begin jury selection.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.808
In regards
to voir dire, counsel,

14:34.841 --> 14:36.042
as you may know,
I typically ta--

14:36.076 --> 14:37.844
Your Honor, if I may?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.982
You have a lot to add these days
it seems, Mr. Donnell.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.518
Actually, my client

14:44.551 --> 14:47.220
has decided to wave a jury

14:47.253 --> 14:48.755
and request a bench trial.

14:52.993 --> 14:53.694
Mr. Cassell...

14:56.563 --> 14:59.299
Mr. Cassell, you understand
that once you wave this right,

14:59.332 --> 15:02.002
the decision cannot be undone.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.370
Your fate will rest
in my hands alone.

15:04.605 --> 15:05.839
Yes, sir.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.544
Ms. Gamble, the Commonwealth
is equally entitled

15:10.577 --> 15:12.045
to try its case before a jury.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.114
Do you have any objection
to Mr. Cassell's waver request?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.517
No, Your Honor,
we're amenable.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.586
Very well then.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.354
We'll begin with opening
statements after lunch.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.056
Until then,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.424
we're in recess.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.069
You hating this
as much as me?

15:36.102 --> 15:36.803
More.

15:36.837 --> 15:38.672
Not possible.
Trust me.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.107
Can I?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.410
Trust you, I mean?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.379
I don't know
who to believe anymore.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.714
Who are the good guys?
Who are the bad?

15:47.748 --> 15:52.252
It was a lot easier when they
all wore black-and-white hats.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.321
I mean, first we give Fleming
a lifetime achievement award,

15:55.355 --> 15:57.190
now we're trying to crack him
over the head with it.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.661
Oh, and by the way,

16:00.694 --> 16:02.395
sorry for pulling you
onto the floor.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.430
Anytime.

16:10.436 --> 16:11.538
(door closes)

16:13.039 --> 16:14.307
(sighs)

16:33.326 --> 16:34.160
Judge.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.295
Mr. Donnell.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.601
Did you enjoy your dinner
the other night?

16:40.634 --> 16:41.802
Oh, very much so.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.969
Very much.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.043
Rumor has it that you're up
for a circuit appointment.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.244
I learned a long time ago

16:51.277 --> 16:53.980
not to put
too much stock in rumors.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.415
You'd be wise
to do the same.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.855
Of course,
I'm not complaining.

17:01.888 --> 17:02.956
It's nice to know
there are people out there

17:02.989 --> 17:04.190
taking the rumor seriously.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.392
I suppose it is.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.262
Judge...

17:11.765 --> 17:12.999
I've been weighing my options

17:13.032 --> 17:15.636
in the case before you,
and, well...

17:17.503 --> 17:19.673
to be candid,
the D. A.'s offered a deal,

17:19.705 --> 17:23.710
a somewhat reasonable deal
in my opinion.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.180
I don't know
if it's the right...

17:30.083 --> 17:31.618
Mr. Donnell,
are you asking me

17:31.652 --> 17:33.587
to handicap
this case for you?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.123
Thinking out loud,
Your Honor.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.626
Well, keep it
to yourself next time.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.228
That way our pleasant chat

17:42.262 --> 17:43.564
won't seem more like a highly

17:43.597 --> 17:45.065
improper ex parte discussion.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.499
Judge, I had no intention--

17:46.533 --> 17:47.801
we're done!

17:55.609 --> 17:57.343
Damn it!

18:04.217 --> 18:06.720
DONNELL: The man cut me off
way before I even got close

18:06.753 --> 18:07.888
to a bribe.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.055
He berated me for initiating

18:09.089 --> 18:10.190
an ex parte discussion.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.725
MITCHELL: I know, I heard,
I was listening.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.059
He is testing you.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.460
I don't buy that,
all right?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.428
I was there.

18:15.461 --> 18:16.930
GAMBLE: Look,
this is a mistake.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.166
This man has done
nothing improper in this case.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.402
Every ruling, every word
out of his mouth,

18:22.435 --> 18:24.070
has a legitimate explanation.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.740
Look, it's understandable
that the two of you are nervous.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.374
It is normal
in an undercover--

18:28.408 --> 18:29.943
I'm getting out,
and you should do the same.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.111
Bobby, It is not that simple!

18:31.144 --> 18:33.580
No, it's very simple.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.815
As soon as Fleming
takes the bench,

18:34.848 --> 18:36.917
Helen will announce
that a deal has been made,

18:36.950 --> 18:37.851
and the case
will be dismissed.

18:37.884 --> 18:38.885
Nobody's announcing anything!

18:38.919 --> 18:40.220
If you don't do it,
I'll do it for you!

18:40.253 --> 18:41.688
I cannot allow that, Bobby.

18:41.722 --> 18:43.423
You son of a bitch!!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.958
You come in here
with complete disregard

18:44.991 --> 18:46.727
for what we do
day in and day out.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.895
And all you're really aiming for
is some high-profile case

18:48.929 --> 18:50.330
so you'll get
the most ink in the press,

18:50.363 --> 18:51.798
get the most bang
for your buck.

18:51.832 --> 18:53.066
That's right.

18:53.099 --> 18:53.934
DONNELL: Just so you can
let everyone know

18:53.967 --> 18:55.201
you're a big shot
doing your job,

18:55.235 --> 18:56.903
and we can all
sleep safe at night.

18:56.937 --> 18:59.405
Judge Fleming
is the most important

18:59.439 --> 19:01.975
and influential jurist
in your district.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.977
He's supposed to stand
for all that is right,

19:04.010 --> 19:04.878
and he is a crook!

19:05.345 --> 19:06.780
I don't know that,

19:06.813 --> 19:10.116
and I will not help you entrap
an innocent Judge.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.989
Bobby, let me remind you

19:16.022 --> 19:18.458
that there will be major
repercussions

19:18.491 --> 19:20.694
if you jeopardize
this investigation.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.299
I suggest you make
this case go away quietly...

19:28.234 --> 19:29.870
because I am done.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.744
(door closes)

19:40.581 --> 19:42.783
Uh, Mr. Donnell?

19:42.816 --> 19:45.819
Walter Cates--
Judge Fleming's clerk?

19:45.852 --> 19:48.522
Yes, right, of course,
I'm sorry.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.490
I'm on my way
to the courtroom now.

19:50.524 --> 19:51.992
Actually, the Judge would like
to see you in chambers.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.129
You know, I need to check
with my firm,

19:56.162 --> 19:58.298
and I don't want to delay
our afternoon session.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.933
Would you ask the Judge
if he could see me

19:59.966 --> 20:01.134
at the end of the day?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.604
Judge Fleming would like
to see you now.

20:05.606 --> 20:06.740
Of course.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.580
Judge?

20:13.614 --> 20:14.380
You asked to see me?

20:14.648 --> 20:15.348
Thank you, Walter.

20:20.554 --> 20:21.522
You ever read any of this
fella's work?

20:21.555 --> 20:23.690
Can't say that I have.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.258
FLEMING: Believes the only way
true justice can be built

20:25.291 --> 20:26.727
is if it's built
on a foundation

20:26.760 --> 20:30.163
of a single,
shared worldview.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.866
Pretty radical stuff.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.934
I got the book as a gift,

20:33.967 --> 20:35.035
so I suppose
it doesn't much matter

20:35.068 --> 20:35.869
I won't be finishing it.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.209
I know we all go through
the security mill out there,

20:43.243 --> 20:45.311
but you can never be sure

20:45.345 --> 20:46.747
who'll try to sneak what
in these days,

20:46.780 --> 20:49.282
so you don't mind if I see
for myself, do you, counselor?

20:50.617 --> 20:52.452
No. Of course not.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.620
Fine. Thank you.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.396
You'll learn to be careful, too,
Mr. Donnell.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.430
You never know
who's listening.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.066
In the courtroom...

21:06.700 --> 21:07.901
in the public restroom...

21:08.468 --> 21:09.603
Yes, sir.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.140
So, what was it you wanted?

21:15.676 --> 21:17.110
I'm not quite sure.

21:18.211 --> 21:19.880
Have a seat, Bobby.

21:19.913 --> 21:20.581
Relax.

21:21.515 --> 21:23.584
I've hung my judicial robes
at the door.

21:23.617 --> 21:27.287
We're simply two men
having a conversation.

21:31.091 --> 21:32.458
Earlier you referred
to a deal

21:32.492 --> 21:33.660
proffered by the assistant D. A.

21:36.897 --> 21:39.833
What exactly
are we talking about?

21:40.266 --> 21:41.401
Three years.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.168
FLEMING: I see.

21:43.036 --> 21:43.904
And how does that sound
to your client?

21:44.370 --> 21:45.238
He'd prefer less.

21:45.539 --> 21:48.408
(chuckling) Touché.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.544
Touché.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.178
Which brings you to me,
is that right?

21:52.212 --> 21:53.279
You'd like to make a deal, too.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.518
If possible, Your Honor,
yes, I would.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.160
$10,000.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.566
I'll need time
to get the money together.

22:13.934 --> 22:15.468
Yes, well,
I have no intention

22:15.502 --> 22:16.837
of sitting through
an entire trial

22:16.870 --> 22:18.438
when I already
know the result.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.041
If we're doing this,
we do it today.

22:21.074 --> 22:21.775
You can have an hour.

22:23.944 --> 22:25.345
I think I can make that happen.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.748
Then I think
you've got an acquittal.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.264
Bobby?

22:47.634 --> 22:49.002
You want this book?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.336
It's yours for the taking
if you like.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.139
Thanks anyway.

23:09.122 --> 23:09.890
He made the offer.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.224
And you didn't have
the wire.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.159
I'm lucky I didn't,
he patted down.

23:13.193 --> 23:14.427
Why couldn't
you have stalled?

23:14.460 --> 23:16.396
I tried, he insisted
I see him immediately.

23:17.097 --> 23:18.064
All right, never mind.

23:18.098 --> 23:18.899
So what happened?

23:18.932 --> 23:19.800
Was he specific?

23:19.833 --> 23:22.168
He wants 10 grand
in an hour.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.906
the clerk told me
to call him when I'm ready.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.509
He's aware
of the arrangement?

23:28.542 --> 23:29.976
It seems.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.813
We're on.

23:34.748 --> 23:35.415
Let's go.

23:38.952 --> 23:39.686
Walter, Bobby Donnell.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.422
I'm approaching the building.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.223
Are we clear?

23:45.592 --> 23:46.960
Hello? Good.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.391
What's he waiting for?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.093
AGENT: This guy's killing me.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.028
Come on, already.

24:24.397 --> 24:26.299
MITCHELL: There he goes,
there he goes.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.472
GAMBLE: I don't believe this.

24:32.506 --> 24:33.473
MITCHELL: Get that old man
out of there.

24:45.686 --> 24:47.754
GAMBLE: Nice work, Walter.

24:58.298 --> 24:59.399
BAILIFF: Be seated.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.339
We meet again.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.108
In the matter of
the Commonwealth vs. Cassell--

25:08.141 --> 25:11.477
Your Honor,
in light of the jury waver

25:11.512 --> 25:13.179
and in the interest
of expediency,

25:13.213 --> 25:17.117
the Commonwealth is prepared
to forego its opening statement

25:17.150 --> 25:18.919
and move forward
with its first witness.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.288
The gesture is appreciated,
counselor.

25:22.322 --> 25:24.390
Appreciated,
and yet as circumstance

25:24.424 --> 25:25.626
would have it unnecessary.

25:26.527 --> 25:27.260
I'm sorry?

25:28.094 --> 25:30.564
Over lunch,
I had the opportunity

25:30.597 --> 25:32.999
to sink my teeth into the issues
raised by counsel

25:33.033 --> 25:36.603
in relation to the defendant's
motion to suppress.

25:36.637 --> 25:39.906
And having been designated
the sole fact-finder,

25:39.940 --> 25:41.708
my stated concerns
about the intertwining

25:41.742 --> 25:43.409
of fact and law

25:43.443 --> 25:44.745
are now moot.

25:44.778 --> 25:45.979
I am prepared to rule.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.549
I see.

25:48.582 --> 25:51.417
After extended consideration
of the testimony

25:51.451 --> 25:53.486
and applicable case law,

25:53.520 --> 25:54.988
it is my conclusion
that the state's

25:55.021 --> 25:56.590
procurement
of the narcotics resulted

25:56.623 --> 25:59.593
from a search that improperly
exceeded the parameters

25:59.626 --> 26:01.862
of the fourth amendment.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.430
And while it pains me greatly

26:04.464 --> 26:05.932
to bar the introduction
of such plainly

26:05.966 --> 26:08.835
incriminating evidence,

26:08.869 --> 26:10.403
the state's infringement
of the rights

26:10.436 --> 26:13.907
of the defendant
leaves me no other option.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.610
The motion to suppress
is therefore granted.

26:17.511 --> 26:18.344
Your Honor...

26:20.480 --> 26:22.916
the defendant moves
for dismissal

26:22.949 --> 26:24.017
of all charges.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.555
Ms. Gamble,
read my written ruling.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.856
I don't see
any way around this.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.426
The prosecution places

26:33.459 --> 26:35.495
its objection on the record.

26:41.234 --> 26:42.703
Very well then.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.406
Noted.

26:52.245 --> 26:52.913
The case is dismissed.

26:54.214 --> 26:55.616
Okay, let's go.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.118
Judge Charles Fleming?

26:58.151 --> 26:59.753
What's going on?

26:59.786 --> 27:00.954
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

27:00.987 --> 27:01.822
FLEMING: This is my courtroom.

27:01.855 --> 27:03.256
How dare you come in here
like this?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.490
AGENT: Judge Fleming,
you're under arrest.

27:04.525 --> 27:05.659
What are you talking about?

27:05.692 --> 27:07.093
You don't have any authority.

27:07.127 --> 27:07.828
What is happening?

27:07.861 --> 27:08.695
You're under arrest

27:08.729 --> 27:09.830
for accepting bribes,

27:10.363 --> 27:11.331
extortion,

27:11.364 --> 27:13.166
obstruction of justice,

27:13.199 --> 27:17.804
and racketeering
under title 8 USC, Section 1962.

27:17.838 --> 27:19.239
You have the right
to remain silent.

27:19.272 --> 27:21.675
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

27:22.375 --> 27:23.910
You have the right
to an attorney.

27:23.944 --> 27:25.078
If you cannot afford one,
an attorney

27:25.111 --> 27:27.280
will be appointed for you.

27:35.756 --> 27:37.390
REPORTER: Are you guilty
of the bribery charges?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.292
Can we have a comment?

27:39.325 --> 27:40.426
(overlapping chatter)

27:40.460 --> 27:42.763
REPORTER: Can we have
a comment, please?

27:42.796 --> 27:43.864
Please. A comment?

27:43.897 --> 27:45.265
How much money
is involved?

27:45.298 --> 27:47.267
How much money
are we talking about?

27:47.300 --> 27:49.636
JUDGE: And with reference
to the remaining counts,

27:49.670 --> 27:51.371
How does
the defendant plead?

27:51.404 --> 27:52.739
ANDERSON: My client pleads
not guilty

27:52.773 --> 27:54.440
to each and every
one of those charges

27:54.474 --> 27:55.408
as well, Your Honor.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.943
JUDGE: Very well.

27:56.977 --> 27:59.045
The court will schedule
a preliminary hearing

27:59.079 --> 28:01.214
for one week from today.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.315
ANDERSON:
In the interim, we request

28:02.348 --> 28:03.449
that Judge Fleming be released

28:03.483 --> 28:04.551
on his own recognizance.

28:04.585 --> 28:05.586
MITCHELL:
The prosecution believes

28:05.619 --> 28:07.487
that the defendant poses
a flight risk.

28:07.521 --> 28:08.789
ANDERSON:
Your Honor, Judge Fleming

28:08.822 --> 28:10.223
is a highly respected jurist.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.191
MITCHELL: Furthermore,
due to the nature

28:11.224 --> 28:12.225
of the allegations,

28:12.258 --> 28:13.627
there is also
the very real potential

28:13.660 --> 28:15.195
for witness tampering.
Your Honor--

28:15.228 --> 28:16.429
MITCHELL: The government
accordingly requests

28:16.462 --> 28:18.431
that the defendant be held
without bail.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.766
Your Honor,
I'll ignore the fact

28:19.800 --> 28:22.168
that pretrial detention
is not meant to be a punishment.

28:22.202 --> 28:25.305
But proposing incarceration
after arresting my client

28:25.338 --> 28:28.474
without even the flimsiest
of evidence is unconscionable.

28:28.909 --> 28:30.143
MITCHELL: This arraignment
is not the time

28:30.176 --> 28:31.377
to debate this case.

28:31.411 --> 28:32.913
I will remind defense counsel

28:32.946 --> 28:34.114
that we have a witness

28:34.147 --> 28:36.482
who will testify
to the Judge's solicitation

28:36.517 --> 28:38.051
as well as a videotape
of the money drop.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.720
JUDGE: Gentlemen, please.

28:39.753 --> 28:42.723
Let's bring this down
a few notches, shall we?

28:44.490 --> 28:45.458
Mr. Anderson.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.763
Judge Fleming appears nowhere
on this videotape,

28:49.796 --> 28:51.397
and there's no reason
to believe he was involved

28:51.431 --> 28:54.000
in any alleged scheme
in any way.

28:54.034 --> 28:55.135
MITCHELL:
Your Honor, as I said,

28:55.168 --> 28:56.737
these are issues
to be raised at trial.

28:56.770 --> 28:59.172
This already shaky case,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.808
where there is no audio
or video documentation

29:01.842 --> 29:03.710
of my client's involvement,

29:03.744 --> 29:06.312
is based on the highly
questionable testimony

29:06.346 --> 29:09.082
of one man,
Attorney Bobby Donnell.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.617
MITCHELL: I have to object.
ANDERSON: Bobby Donnell,

29:10.651 --> 29:12.018
the prosecution's only witness,

29:12.052 --> 29:13.920
was charged with the passing
of information

29:13.954 --> 29:15.321
from the D. A.'s office

29:15.355 --> 29:18.759
that resulted in the deaths
of two police officers.

29:18.792 --> 29:20.426
He was also charged
with the murder

29:20.460 --> 29:22.195
of a third man William Hinks.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.264
MITCHELL: Mr. Donnell
was cleared of any wrongdoing

29:24.297 --> 29:25.398
in both cases, Your Honor.

29:25.732 --> 29:28.735
Are we to believe anything
that Mr. Donnell says?

29:29.503 --> 29:31.137
In fact, I have it
on authority

29:31.171 --> 29:33.373
that the very reason
Mr. Donnell was chosen

29:33.406 --> 29:34.240
to try to pull off

29:34.274 --> 29:35.742
this alleged sting operation

29:35.776 --> 29:36.610
in the first place...

29:36.643 --> 29:37.377
we are not here to talk--

29:37.410 --> 29:38.111
Mr. Mitchell,

29:38.712 --> 29:40.647
be grateful I am not
exposing all

29:40.681 --> 29:43.149
of your so-called witness's
well-documented exploits,

29:43.517 --> 29:45.786
both in and out
of the courtroom.

29:46.419 --> 29:49.222
But for reasons
of this hearing,

29:49.823 --> 29:52.693
is Judge Fleming
a flight risk? No.

29:52.726 --> 29:54.661
Does he present a danger
to the community?

29:54.695 --> 29:55.896
Certainly not.

29:56.129 --> 29:58.064
Your Honor, all I ask

29:58.098 --> 30:01.267
is that you consider
the merits of this case

30:01.301 --> 30:03.904
before denying his liberty.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.506
Mr. Donnell is not
the kind of person

30:05.539 --> 30:07.908
this great country's
Department of Justice

30:07.941 --> 30:10.577
should be relying on
in its search for truth.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.580
The people certainly deserve

30:13.614 --> 30:15.716
better than Bobby Donnell.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.954
The defendant will surrender
his passport

30:20.987 --> 30:23.189
to the clerk of the court.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.559
Bail is set at $25,000.

30:32.533 --> 30:33.900
GAMBLE: Have you seen
where Bobby went?

30:33.934 --> 30:35.569
I didn't notice, no.

30:35.602 --> 30:36.570
Now, I'll be honest.

30:36.603 --> 30:37.838
In the end,
it's worth all the trouble,

30:37.871 --> 30:39.339
don't you think?

30:39.372 --> 30:40.507
What are you talking about?

30:40.541 --> 30:42.208
We got him.

30:42.242 --> 30:43.076
Got him?

30:43.109 --> 30:44.444
You haven't gone to trial.

30:44.477 --> 30:45.512
No, we probably won't.

30:45.546 --> 30:46.847
Most likely
Fleming will plead.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.381
He'll resign
from the bench,

30:48.414 --> 30:49.550
He'll serve maybe three years,

30:49.583 --> 30:52.686
and get probation for two.

30:52.719 --> 30:53.687
Look...

30:53.720 --> 30:55.656
Anderson just hung Bobby out

30:55.689 --> 30:56.957
to dry in there.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.192
You plead this out,
you'll give everyone

30:59.225 --> 31:01.227
the impression
the Feds can't build a case

31:01.261 --> 31:02.863
on Bobby's testimony.

31:02.896 --> 31:03.630
We probably can't.

31:05.098 --> 31:07.333
Then why did you involve him
in the first place?

31:07.367 --> 31:09.870
He was our best shot at making
this investigation a success.

31:09.903 --> 31:11.805
No matter what the cost.

31:11.838 --> 31:14.174
MITCHELL: Look, I have to decide
if I can win this case.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.175
The clerk's not talking,

31:15.208 --> 31:17.477
and Donnell simply lacks
credibility.

31:17.511 --> 31:19.045
Now, we have limited resources

31:19.079 --> 31:20.313
and I'm not about
to spend them

31:20.346 --> 31:21.848
on some long,
expensive trial

31:21.882 --> 31:23.483
just to see that Fleming
winds up in jail.

31:23.517 --> 31:25.118
He's off the bench.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.186
He's gone.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.153
That's all that matters.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.955
GAMBLE: Let me talk
to Fleming.

31:28.989 --> 31:29.890
I'll be the good cop.

31:29.923 --> 31:30.857
He knows me.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.959
There's got
to be more there.

31:35.128 --> 31:36.897
Look, it's the least
you can do

31:36.930 --> 31:38.031
after coming in here

31:38.064 --> 31:39.900
and making such a mess.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.108
I don't know
the purpose of this.

31:48.141 --> 31:50.376
My client maintains
his innocence.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.012
We have nothing
to offer.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.281
Your honor...

31:55.315 --> 31:56.583
you're not the real target

31:56.617 --> 31:58.719
of the government's
investigation.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.221
They're simply looking
for a way in.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.657
They still need to know

32:03.690 --> 32:05.892
how many others were involved
in the scheme.

32:05.926 --> 32:07.561
Helen,

32:07.594 --> 32:09.095
don't treat me
like a child.

32:09.129 --> 32:10.864
And let's not waste any time
discussing a scheme.

32:10.897 --> 32:12.032
There was no scheme.

32:12.065 --> 32:14.935
If you reveal the attorneys
who participated,

32:14.968 --> 32:16.369
the Department of Justice

32:16.402 --> 32:18.438
will make you
a reasonable offer.

32:19.540 --> 32:20.240
Please.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.009
Consider taking
advantage of this.

32:23.043 --> 32:24.711
You can help yourself here.

32:25.712 --> 32:27.047
ANDERSON: He'll help himself

32:27.080 --> 32:28.248
by seeing this through to trial.

32:28.281 --> 32:29.716
(knocks on door)

32:29.750 --> 32:30.851
ANDERSON: Do you honestly
expect to prove this

32:30.884 --> 32:32.185
beyond a reasonable doubt?

32:33.186 --> 32:33.987
On what basis?

32:34.020 --> 32:36.056
Bobby Donnell's testimony?

32:38.058 --> 32:39.660
If we could have
just another minute,

32:39.693 --> 32:41.862
I think we can make
some progress here.

32:44.865 --> 32:45.999
(door opens)

32:47.233 --> 32:50.236
(music playing)

32:56.309 --> 32:57.678
Your Honor...

33:00.981 --> 33:03.550
I'm--I'm so sorry.

33:08.755 --> 33:10.256
Get him out of here.

33:10.290 --> 33:13.293
(music playing)

33:19.332 --> 33:20.834
MITCHELL: Sir?

33:22.803 --> 33:23.904
Mr. Fleming?

33:28.909 --> 33:31.311
I need time to consult
with my client.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.347
(music playing)

33:43.456 --> 33:45.391
Hey.

33:45.425 --> 33:48.128
I got a call from a friend
who sits federal court,

33:48.161 --> 33:50.030
so I know what happened.

33:50.063 --> 33:50.964
It's a big deal,

33:50.997 --> 33:52.098
about Fleming, of course,

33:52.132 --> 33:54.601
but also about Bobby
getting lynched by Anderson.

33:55.602 --> 33:57.170
I came by to see
how he's doing.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.239
He's in his office.

33:59.272 --> 34:00.206
He won't talk.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.708
Well, that's Bobby.

34:05.011 --> 34:06.547
Yeah.

34:06.580 --> 34:07.347
That's Bobby.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.149
Yeah, I should have been
at the arraignment,

34:09.181 --> 34:11.251
but I've been up
to my neck with work,

34:11.284 --> 34:13.219
and Judge Fleming
is someone I admired,

34:13.253 --> 34:15.088
so out of respect...

34:18.291 --> 34:19.659
Bobby didn't
want me there.

34:20.994 --> 34:22.062
Did he say that?

34:22.094 --> 34:23.329
Oh, come on, Helen.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.998
Bobby can make his point
perfectly clear

34:25.031 --> 34:26.733
without saying
a word.

34:26.766 --> 34:28.768
GAMBLE: Lindsay, I hope you know

34:28.802 --> 34:30.536
this isn't about Bobby
shutting you out.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.172
I think he--

34:33.206 --> 34:35.041
when he's up
against his demons,

34:35.074 --> 34:37.010
he'd rather
battle them alone.

34:37.043 --> 34:39.079
I happen to be along
for the ride on this one.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.216
I'm glad you can be there
for him.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.952
(telephone rings)

34:45.985 --> 34:48.321
Donnell, Young,
Dole, and Frutt.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.222
Yeah, sure.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.724
It's your office.

34:52.826 --> 34:54.293
Hello?

34:55.829 --> 34:57.230
I'll be right over.

34:58.732 --> 35:00.333
Judge Fleming
and his attorneys

35:00.366 --> 35:02.569
are requesting a meeting.

35:02.603 --> 35:04.037
Looks like they're ready
to make a deal.

35:08.575 --> 35:09.910
Let me say at the outset,

35:09.943 --> 35:11.444
I am still far
from convinced

35:11.477 --> 35:13.313
you have enough evidence
for conviction.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.649
But to avoid the mud

35:15.682 --> 35:18.351
of a media-saturated trial,

35:18.384 --> 35:19.686
Judge Fleming may be willing

35:19.720 --> 35:21.054
to assist
your investigation.

35:21.087 --> 35:22.723
May be?

35:22.756 --> 35:24.057
ANDERSON:
We're not rolling over here.

35:24.090 --> 35:25.959
Unless the deal
is more than fair,

35:25.992 --> 35:27.528
the judge is prepared
to go to trial.

35:27.828 --> 35:29.195
We have the clerk's
testimony.

35:29.763 --> 35:31.097
Continue, Mr. Anderson.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.234
In exchange
for Judge Fleming's

35:34.267 --> 35:35.468
full cooperation,

35:35.501 --> 35:38.238
we expect the government
to drop both the Rico

35:38.271 --> 35:39.239
and the Hobbs Act counts.

35:39.272 --> 35:40.674
That's the entire federal case.

35:40.707 --> 35:43.844
ANDERSON: You still have
state-based fraud--

35:43.877 --> 35:45.378
five years.

35:45.411 --> 35:46.680
My client serves three.

35:46.713 --> 35:48.715
MITCHELL : Well, that would be
a hell of a deal...

35:48.749 --> 35:49.950
for you.

35:49.983 --> 35:51.084
That's what we want.

35:52.052 --> 35:53.720
I'm certainly not
committing to that.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.459
In addition,
we're prepared

35:59.492 --> 36:01.294
to provide
detailed records

36:01.327 --> 36:02.629
maintained by Judge Fleming

36:02.663 --> 36:03.930
over a period of 6 years.

36:05.566 --> 36:07.768
The records implicate
15 attorneys.

36:13.674 --> 36:15.509
I suspect we'll be able
to work something out.

36:18.779 --> 36:20.847
Is it possible
you're deriving satisfaction

36:20.881 --> 36:21.815
from all of this, Helen?

36:21.848 --> 36:24.350
No, Your Honor.
I am not.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.588
In all the times you have
appeared before me,

36:27.621 --> 36:30.123
I think you know
that I've been an evenhanded,

36:30.156 --> 36:32.292
decent, if not humane, jurist.

36:33.594 --> 36:34.761
For nearly 30 years,

36:34.795 --> 36:36.763
my job, my charge

36:36.797 --> 36:37.931
has been to make reasoned,

36:37.964 --> 36:40.166
dispassionate decisions.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.936
And that is what I have done.

36:42.969 --> 36:45.205
Always.

36:45.238 --> 36:47.107
Imperfect, I will admit
that I may have overstepped

36:47.140 --> 36:47.941
my boundaries.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.042
But it was not as you suggest,

36:49.075 --> 36:50.043
Mr. Mitchell,

36:50.076 --> 36:52.045
a matter of craven desire.

36:52.078 --> 36:53.880
On those occasions
when I was approached

36:53.914 --> 36:54.881
for a favor,

36:54.915 --> 36:58.418
I would not, did not,

36:58.451 --> 37:01.421
allow a lesser argument
to triumph over a better one.

37:01.454 --> 37:03.924
Wrong must never win
by technicality.

37:05.191 --> 37:06.560
Now, then,

37:06.593 --> 37:07.694
I have done nothing illicit.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.596
What I did do was expedite cases

37:09.630 --> 37:11.164
that came before me.

37:11.197 --> 37:12.432
If I benefited from such,

37:12.465 --> 37:14.400
well, then, so be it.

37:14.434 --> 37:16.670
This is not about
expediting anything.

37:16.937 --> 37:19.205
Wisdom is justified
by her children, Mr. Mitchell.

37:19.239 --> 37:20.807
Look at my record.

37:20.841 --> 37:21.908
Listen to what my colleagues

37:21.942 --> 37:22.976
have to say about me.

37:23.009 --> 37:24.377
You are in no position to judge.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.279
From what I have seen
on the bench,

37:26.312 --> 37:27.714
ill-prepared,

37:27.748 --> 37:28.582
uncommitted,

37:28.615 --> 37:29.415
addled attorneys

37:29.449 --> 37:31.585
who fall asleep at trial,

37:31.618 --> 37:34.154
who are unable to prepare
an articulate brief

37:34.187 --> 37:36.657
are these the ones best suited
to mete out justice?

37:36.690 --> 37:39.392
I've devoted my life
to being a judge.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.862
And though the courtroom be
an adversarial arena,

37:41.895 --> 37:44.430
I am more than a referee, sir.

37:44.464 --> 37:45.999
More than a linesman.

37:48.501 --> 37:49.903
I am the game.

37:56.276 --> 37:59.546
Well, at any rate...

37:59.580 --> 38:01.281
I suppose this gives you
great bragging rights

38:01.314 --> 38:02.215
with the rest of the politicos

38:02.248 --> 38:02.949
in your office.

38:02.983 --> 38:05.852
Forgive me, your honor.

38:05.886 --> 38:07.821
You being here has nothing

38:07.854 --> 38:11.391
to do with me
or Bobby Donnell.

38:11.424 --> 38:12.826
The only thing I have derived

38:12.859 --> 38:14.695
from my participation

38:14.728 --> 38:16.362
is a profound sadness.

38:19.032 --> 38:21.568
I watched and learned
from you, sir.

38:27.841 --> 38:31.477
It appears
that chapter is closed.

38:31.512 --> 38:33.046
You have cast out
the dirty judge.

38:33.079 --> 38:34.214
Justice is restored.

38:35.949 --> 38:36.683
So there it is.

38:38.719 --> 38:39.953
Here's the list of names.

38:39.986 --> 38:40.887
No one has reviewed it,

38:40.921 --> 38:42.488
not even my attorney.

38:43.289 --> 38:45.091
Let the blood bath begin.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.393
(chuckles)

38:47.427 --> 38:48.094
Clever.

38:48.762 --> 38:49.796
(gunshot)

38:49.830 --> 38:52.833
(music playing)

39:27.467 --> 39:30.737
He was very...

39:30.771 --> 39:33.339
(sighs)

39:33.373 --> 39:35.375
It's as if there was no doubt
in his mind.

39:35.408 --> 39:37.210
This was his way out.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.348
He could have
started over.

39:42.382 --> 39:43.884
Uh-hmm.

39:43.917 --> 39:46.587
I think that's probably
what frightened him.

39:48.054 --> 39:50.691
Nobody can really
start over, can they?

39:53.159 --> 39:54.661
I'm sorry
you had to be there.

39:54.695 --> 39:55.461
Yeah.

39:58.832 --> 40:01.702
After it happened,
it was a madhouse...

40:03.169 --> 40:05.405
between the cops
and paramedics.

40:07.808 --> 40:10.110
I came right up here
and called you.

40:11.377 --> 40:12.913
I didn't know
what else to do.

40:14.581 --> 40:16.082
I'm glad you did.

40:18.351 --> 40:19.385
How are you doing?

40:22.856 --> 40:23.857
This...

40:30.096 --> 40:32.432
today was a really
lousy day.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.071
Yeah.

40:38.104 --> 40:41.107
(music playing)

40:47.080 --> 40:48.414
Your wife's worried
about you.

40:52.185 --> 40:53.153
She's always worried
about me.

40:55.055 --> 40:56.056
You'll be okay tonight?

40:56.089 --> 40:57.190
Yes.

41:01.695 --> 41:02.863
Bobby...

41:03.864 --> 41:05.832
in all the confusion

41:05.866 --> 41:07.934
before Mitchell took
Fleming's file,

41:07.968 --> 41:10.303
I had a chance
to look through it.

41:14.675 --> 41:16.643
I actually removed a folder.

41:31.057 --> 41:33.594
That--that bastard.

41:40.233 --> 41:42.135
Are you accusing me
of something?

41:42.503 --> 41:43.937
Of course not.

41:44.738 --> 41:47.741
This is bogus, Helen.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.777
Fleming was trying
to get even.

41:50.811 --> 41:52.078
By the time
I clear my name,

41:52.112 --> 41:54.114
he will have succeeded.

41:57.050 --> 41:58.919
That bastard.

42:06.426 --> 42:07.427
Thanks for warning me.

42:08.829 --> 42:09.930
Okay.

42:15.001 --> 42:16.837
(door closes)

42:16.870 --> 42:19.873
(music playing)

42:58.945 --> 43:00.213
DONNELL:
Next on The Practice.

43:00.246 --> 43:01.615
My husband had
a mental breakdown.

43:02.148 --> 43:03.083
I'm sorry.

43:03.116 --> 43:04.450
He's schizophrenic.

43:05.118 --> 43:06.587
Tell me how I can help.

43:06.620 --> 43:08.488
Bill's being sued, Jimmy.

43:08.522 --> 43:11.257
Bill Munce was my friend.

43:11.291 --> 43:12.425
He used to pushed me.

43:12.458 --> 43:13.527
about going
to law school.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.662
These people got
nobody else to turn to.

43:15.696 --> 43:16.763
One day.

43:16.797 --> 43:17.864
That's all you get.

43:17.898 --> 43:19.566
I wish I could say
he's improving,

43:19.600 --> 43:20.601
but he's not.

43:20.634 --> 43:22.035
It's important
that you respect

43:22.068 --> 43:22.836
his reality.

43:22.869 --> 43:24.004
Jimmy.

43:24.037 --> 43:25.138
Bill.

43:29.576 --> 43:32.579
(music playing)

43:55.869 --> 43:57.037
You stinker!
