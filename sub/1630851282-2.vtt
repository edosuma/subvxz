- I feel awful.

20:56.241 --> 20:58.965
- Do you have cake
in your shoes too?

20:59.034 --> 21:01.310
- No, for Carina.

21:02.931 --> 21:06.137
- Oh, right.

21:06.206 --> 21:07.448
- Hey, birthday girl.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.827
We're really sorry
for ruining your party.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.172
- We want to make things right.

21:11.241 --> 21:12.413
- We know that
no amount of money

21:12.482 --> 21:14.034
is going to make things
better, but--

21:14.103 --> 21:18.241
- $20 each, $40 for me.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.000
- That's all the money we made.

21:21.068 --> 21:23.965
- Pay up.

21:25.724 --> 21:28.206
- Are we even?
- We're getting there.

21:28.275 --> 21:30.517
Hey, Mom.
- Yes, honey?

21:30.586 --> 21:33.655
- Since the raccoons
ruined my birthday,

21:33.724 --> 21:36.206
the princess agreed
to come back tomorrow.

21:36.275 --> 21:38.000
Isn't that right?

21:38.068 --> 21:41.034
- I guess it is, Carina.

21:41.103 --> 21:44.551
- And they agreed
to do it for free.

21:44.620 --> 21:47.034
- We did.
- Yes.

21:47.103 --> 21:50.068
And you also agreed to bake me
a new cake with a castle on it.

21:50.137 --> 21:52.931
- Don't push your luck, Carina.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.413
- We'll be back tomorrow

21:54.482 --> 21:56.310
and we'll make it
a special birthday.

21:56.379 --> 21:58.034
[cheers and applause]

21:58.103 --> 21:59.793
- Until then...

21:59.862 --> 22:03.275
both:
Ta-ta, ta-ta, ta-ta.

22:03.344 --> 22:04.931
- Ta-ta!
- Ta-ta!

22:05.000 --> 22:06.206
- Ta-ta!
- Ta-ta!

22:06.275 --> 22:07.206
- Ta-ta!
- Ta-ta!

22:07.275 --> 22:09.310
- Ta-ta!
- Ta-ta!
