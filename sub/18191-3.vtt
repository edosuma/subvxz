00:01.102 --> 00:02.737
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE."

00:02.770 --> 00:04.405
APRIL,
YOU HAVE CANCER.

00:04.437 --> 00:05.472
I'M NOT GONNA DIE.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.107
WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TELL ME?

00:07.141 --> 00:08.175
OH, UM...

00:08.208 --> 00:10.044
YOU DESERVE TO MEET SOMEONE.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.513
YOU'RE LEO HENDRIE.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.082
ONE OF MY DAD'S
NEW INTERNS?

00:15.115 --> 00:16.417
CAN I CALL YOU "MOM"?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.085
- YOU'RE NOT GROUNDED.
- REALLY?

00:18.118 --> 00:19.387
BUT I WANT YOU
TO GET A JOB.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.021
THERE'S A HEART IN HERE.
IT MAY BE COVERED IN

00:21.054 --> 00:22.757
A NIETZSCHE QUOTE,
BUT IT'S IN THERE.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.759
- WHO'S NATALIE ORTIZ?
- I DON'T KNOW. WHO IS SHE?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.294
SOME GIRL WHO'S CAR
YOU TOOK A PICTURE OF.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.495
WHY?

00:28.528 --> 00:31.464
YOU REALLY SHOULD STOP
DISTRACTING ME AT WORK.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.067
PLEASE,
I'M INSPIRING YOU.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.737
( needle scratching on record )

00:46.414 --> 00:48.182
( sighs )

00:48.215 --> 00:49.582
I SHOULD REALLY
TURN THAT OVER.

00:49.616 --> 00:50.718
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE RECORD

00:50.750 --> 00:53.052
OR ARE YOU TALKING
DIRTY TO ME?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.621
- A LITTLE OF BOTH.
- ( chuckles )

01:01.762 --> 01:03.197
IS GRAHAM GONNA WALK IN?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.399
NO NO NO. HE'S AT
A COFFEE TASTING.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.433
OF COURSE HE IS.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.739
I HOPE IT'S
REALLY GOOD COFFEE.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.406
MM.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.775
COME ON.
LET'S GO TO MY ROOM.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.775
( sighs )

01:51.344 --> 01:53.514
( exhales )

02:01.221 --> 02:03.323
Dominic:
SO TORI AMOS OR ENYA?

02:03.356 --> 02:05.225
I'M KIDDING.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.195
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I'M JUST NOT...

02:09.229 --> 02:11.298
FEELING WELL
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.433
OH, NO.
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.602
NOTHING. I JUST THINK
MAYBE THE CHICKEN

02:14.634 --> 02:16.270
AT THAT PLACE WASN'T
COOKED OR SOMETHING.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.805
LET ME GET YOU SOME WATER.

02:17.837 --> 02:21.808
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
GO HOME AND SLEEP AT
MY OWN PLACE TONIGHT.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.143
Dominic:
ARE YOU SURE?

02:23.176 --> 02:25.246
I'LL BE FINE.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.750

02:29.783 --> 02:32.920
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

02:33.152 --> 02:36.323

02:38.224 --> 02:42.729

02:51.237 --> 02:53.606
WELL, THERE ARE WORSE
FORMS OF BLEEDING THAT
CAN RUIN A DATE.

02:56.676 --> 02:57.777
HAVE A LOVELY DAY.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.314
DO YOU NEED TO
CALL GEORGE ABOUT THIS?

03:01.348 --> 03:02.816
NO, I MEAN, HE SAID
THIS COULD HAPPEN.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.817
IT'S A COMMON SYMPTOM.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.951
SO HOW'D DOMINIC REACT?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.253
I JUST LET HIM THINK
I HAD FOOD POISONING.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.955
BECAUSE GOING ALL
"BRIDESMAIDS"

03:09.188 --> 03:10.858
ALL OVER HIS APARTMENT
IS MORE ATTRACTIVE?

03:10.890 --> 03:13.526
WELL, MAYBE IT'S BETTER
THAT THIS HAPPENED.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.429
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
REALLY MESSED UP

03:15.461 --> 03:16.430
FOR ME TO HAVE
SEX WITH A GUY

03:16.462 --> 03:17.798
BEFORE I TELL HIM
THAT I'M SICK.

03:17.830 --> 03:18.765
WHY?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.501
I MEAN,
IT'S LIKE LYING, RIGHT?

03:22.269 --> 03:23.704
YEAH, BUT IF YOU TELL HIM
YOU'RE SICK FIRST AND HE
FREAKS OUT,

03:23.736 --> 03:24.771
YOU MIGHT NEVER
HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

03:24.805 --> 03:25.772
AND THAT JUST
SEEMS WRONG.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.841
I KNOW.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.576
SO WHEN DO I TELL HIM?

03:29.610 --> 03:30.711
BEFORE OR AFTER SEX?

03:30.743 --> 03:33.813
DURING.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.715
( both chuckle )

03:34.747 --> 03:36.283
SERIOUSLY, WHEN?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.884
I MEAN,
HE JUST MADE IT SO CLEAR

03:37.918 --> 03:39.853
THAT HE LOVES HOW
DRAMA FREE I AM,

03:39.887 --> 03:42.590
AND HE'S THE FIRST GUY
THAT I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN EXCITED ABOUT

03:42.622 --> 03:44.557
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.460
I KIND OF WANT TO
ENJOY IT A LITTLE LONGER

03:46.492 --> 03:50.296
BEFORE I PUT IT
ALL ON THE LINE.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.632
IS THAT SELFISH?

03:51.664 --> 03:52.966
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS SELFISH FOR YOU NOW.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.269
YOU HAVE CANCER.
YOU GET TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

03:55.301 --> 03:56.804
EMBRACE IT.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.271
Stan: APRIL?

03:58.305 --> 03:59.539
OH, HI, STAN.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.841
THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.876
I HOPE YOU MEAN
PROFESSIONALLY.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.545
SO, HOW'S THE MORNING GOING?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.980
BUSY.
KEVIN CALLED IN SICK.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.848
SICK?
OR HUNG OVER?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.751
OH, SICK FOR SURE.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.453
THERE WAS PHLEGM.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.288
HUH. YOU'RE WAY TOO
EASY OF A MANAGER,

04:15.322 --> 04:16.990
UNLIKE APRIL HERE.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.026
SHE REALLY KNEW
HOW TO CRACK THAT WHIP.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.728
PROFESSIONALLY.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.930
BETH,
GATHER THE TROOPS.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.634
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.569
IT'S GONNA CHANGE
THE LIVES OF EVERYONE
HERE AT THE DIESEL CAFE.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.605
FOAM ART.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.480
SOMETIMES, WHEN I WORK HERE
I WONDER IF I'M DREAMING.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.658
( elevator dings )

04:57.363 --> 04:58.632
Dana:
HOLD THAT, PLEASE.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.800
THERE'S SOMEONE IN HERE,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.069
BUT LET'S JUST
TAKE THIS ONE

05:02.302 --> 05:04.571
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
MR. HENDRIE.

05:04.605 --> 05:08.341
I'M SO GLAD WE WERE ABLE
TO GET A MEETING WITH
LAWRENCE THIS QUICKLY.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.944
THIS IS REALLY GONNA HELP
THE CAMPAIGN, MR. HENDRIE.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.812
I TOLD YOU,
CALL ME BRUCE.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.081
RIGHT. SO SORRY.
THANK YOU, BRUCE.

05:15.314 --> 05:18.351
Leo: THE QUESTION IS,
DOES HE KNOW YOUR FIRST NAME?

05:18.384 --> 05:19.853
I'M BETTING
THAT HE DOESN'T.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.689
CORRECT ME IF
I'M WRONG, BRUCE.

05:21.721 --> 05:24.824
YOU STILL TAKING THE BOAT
OUT TOMORROW, LEO?

05:24.858 --> 05:28.862
ASSUMING THAT YOUR STAFF
REMEMBERED TO PUT GAS IN
IT THIS TIME.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.997
DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO CALL THE COAST GUARD

05:30.029 --> 05:31.432
WHEN I'M HALFWAY
TO THE VINEYARD AGAIN.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.865
( elevator dings )

05:37.805 --> 05:39.906
Stephen:
I've made inexcusable

05:39.939 --> 05:42.709
and unforgiveable
mistakes against my wife...

05:42.742 --> 05:43.877
DANNY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.846
GOVERNOR VONN GOT CAUGHT
WITH HIS PANTS DOWN.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.781
A STAFFER IN HIS OFFICE
REVEALED SOME FAIRLY EXPLICIT

05:47.814 --> 05:49.850
- TEXTS FROM THE GOVERNOR.
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.384
HE'S SUCH
A WOMANIZING SLEAZE.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.786
IS THE STAFFER
TALKING?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.654
ACTUALLY, HE IS WITH
HIS FAMILY IN BALTIMORE

05:54.687 --> 05:56.923
ASKING PRESS TO
RESPECT HIS PRIVACY.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.858
OKAY,
NOW I'M SURPRISED.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.793
WOW.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.795
OH, I BET THAT'S WHAT
BRUCE HENDRIE WAS DOING HERE.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.464
WHOA, HENDRIE WAS HERE?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.867
YEAH, I SAW HIM IN THE ELEVATOR
WITH HIS OBNOXIOUS SON LEO.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.668
THEY'RE MEETING
WITH LAWRENCE.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.670
AND I'M SURE RAQUEL.
GOD, SHE IS SO FINE.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.939
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ME.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.874
YEAH, IT SUCKS.
YOU WOULD HAVE
HAD A HUGE STORY.

06:13.906 --> 06:15.675
YEAH, THANKS, DANNY.
I KNOW.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.478
APRIL, DO NOT TURN AROUND.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO TURN AROUND.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.745
DANNY GUPTA.

06:18.778 --> 06:19.947
PAUL PETERS.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.048
HEY, DID YOU HAPPEN
TO READ MY LAST COLUMN?

06:22.081 --> 06:24.550
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A POLICY
OF NOT READING ANY COLUMNS
CALLED "WHAT THE HECK?"

06:24.584 --> 06:25.918
SO, NO.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.620
WELL, I REALLY THINK
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND
IT INTERESTING.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.423
IT WAS ABOUT HOW
TRACES OF RAT FECES

06:29.456 --> 06:31.158
ARE OFTEN FOUND ON
THE TOPS OF SODA CANS,

06:31.391 --> 06:33.494
BUT I'M SURE
YOU RINSED THAT OFF.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.129
I NEED A 500 WORD PIECE FOR MY
"HEALTH AND WELLNESS" BLOG.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.764
UM, NO THANKS.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.566
I KNOW THAT'S ONLY
TWO WORDS,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.033
BUT PRINT IT 250 TIMES,
DONE.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.002
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
HEARD THE PITCH YET.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.437
I'VE GOT A LOCAL
FARMER'S MARKET VENDOR

06:44.471 --> 06:46.038
WHO CLAIMS THAT
HIS CARROT JUICE

06:46.072 --> 06:48.542
TREATS CANCER SYMPTOMS,
AND CAN KEEP THE DISEASE
FROM SPREADING.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.644
SWEARS IT'S WORKED ON
DOZENS OF PATIENTS ALREADY.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.112
I DON'T DO SOFT NEWS.

06:52.146 --> 06:53.646
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
A FLOATER, RIGHT?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.449
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
KISSING MY ASS?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.084
( chuckles )
I MAKE IT A POINT, PAUL,

06:57.117 --> 06:58.985
TO KNOW THE RIGHT
ASSES TO KISS.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.987
I DON'T HAVE
AN ASSIGNMENT RIGHT NOW.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.822
I COULD TAKE IT.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.024
- REALLY?
- REALLY?

07:05.057 --> 07:07.461
YEAH. SURE.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.829
"WHAT THE HECK?"

07:12.966 --> 07:15.468
DO YOU THINK ANYONE ACTUALLY
WENT TO THAT ASSEMBLY?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.069
SERIOUSLY.
WHAT KIND OF A SCHOOL

07:17.103 --> 07:18.805
MAKES AN ASSEMBLY
OPTIONAL?

07:18.838 --> 07:20.740
ESPECIALLY AN
A CAPPELLA ASSEMBLY.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.942
IT'S LIKE ASKING IF
ANYONE WANTS TO VOLUNTEER

07:22.975 --> 07:24.076
TO DROWN THEMSELVES.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.012
( clattering )

07:26.045 --> 07:27.648
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:31.518 --> 07:32.853
- MOM?
- ( gasps )

07:32.886 --> 07:34.754
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.855
BRENNA, WHY ARE YOU
HOME SO EARLY?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.824
WE HAD AN ASSEMBLY.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.959
IT WAS OPTIONAL.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.127
AND WE'RE PRO-CHOICE.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.663
WERE YOU TAKING
A NAP OR SOMETHING?

07:43.697 --> 07:44.965
WE CAN JUST
GO UPSTAIRS.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.098
HON, CAN YOU
GIVE US A SECOND?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.000
- US?
- PLEASE, HONEY,
JUST GIVE US--

07:51.872 --> 07:53.706
OH MY GOD.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.776
SWEETIE,
REMEMBER BEN?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.913
NO, "REMEMBER" IS
THE WRONG WORD.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.514
YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET.
THIS IS BEN.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.016
YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE HIM
FROM HIS PROFILE.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.985
HE'S NOT A COMPLETE
STRANGER.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.889
SARA, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN REALLY MAKE THIS
ANY LESS AWKWARD.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.995
DR. CARVER,
YOUR BLOUSE IS
KIND OF OPEN.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.863
( gasps )
OH MY GOSH.

08:16.896 --> 08:17.997
OH, BRENNA.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.533
( groans )

08:19.565 --> 08:21.067
( chuckles )

08:22.269 --> 08:24.004
Gerald:
THERE YOU GO.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.238
SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.242
( sighs )

08:30.810 --> 08:33.046
- HI THERE.
- HI.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.148
CAN I OFFER YOU
A SAMPLE?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
SURE, THANKS.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.118
YEAH.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.620
I'M A REPORTER
AT THE "BOSTON POST."

08:39.653 --> 08:40.787
- OH.
- APRIL CARVER.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.054
- OH.
- I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE

08:42.088 --> 08:43.657
FOR OUR BLOG
ABOUT YOUR JUICE.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.826
GERALD RAYBURN.
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT I'M NEWSWORTHY.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.894
- THANK YOU.
- DO YOU MIND IF I
RECORD A FEW QUESTIONS?

08:47.927 --> 08:50.563
- OH, NOT AT ALL.
- THANK YOU.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.966
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN BUSINESS?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.034
OH, LETS SEE,
THAT WOULD BE ABOUT

08:55.067 --> 08:56.903
TWO YEARS NOW.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.773
I WAS LOOKING FOR
ALTERNATIVE WAYS
TO HELP MY HEALTH,

08:59.806 --> 09:02.042
AND I HAPPENED UPON
THIS CONCOCTION

09:02.075 --> 09:03.809
SOON AFTER
I WAS DIAGNOSED.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.046
OH, YOU HAVE CANCER?

09:06.078 --> 09:08.115
MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.816
I'M SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.551
YOU LOOK GREAT THOUGH.
ARE YOU IN REMISSION?

09:11.585 --> 09:13.586
NO.
( chuckles )

09:13.620 --> 09:16.056
UH, WE TRIED CHEMO
A COUPLE TIMES,

09:16.088 --> 09:18.057
BUT THAT JUST
MADE ME FEEL WORSE.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.094
SO NOW I AM JUST
LIVING WITH CANCER.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.065
OH, GOD.
IF THAT SOUNDS DEPRESSING,

09:25.097 --> 09:28.067
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
THAT YOU NEVER TRULY LIVE

09:28.100 --> 09:30.070
UNTIL YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.307
AND YOU CREDIT THE CARROT JUICE
FOR KEEPING YOU ALIVE?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.841
OH, NO. GOD. IT'S GOOD,
BUT IT'S NOT THAT GOOD.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.211
( chuckles )
IT HELPED THOUGH, I THINK.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.682
HAS IT HELPED WITH
ANY OF YOUR SYMPTOMS?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.717
WELL, HERE. WHY DON'T YOU
JUST READ ALL ABOUT IT?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.957
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T I
JUST TAKE A FEW BOTTLES

09:50.990 --> 09:52.259
JUST FOR RESEARCH.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.659
DONE DEAL.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.100
MOM, SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
I PROMISE.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.703
I KNOW, BUT I WANT BRENNA
TO FEEL SAFE IN HER OWN HOME.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.105
- AND NOW--
- SHE DOES FEEL SAFE.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.706
NOW YOU'RE JUST
OVERREACTING.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.908
IS SHE?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.076
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WITH THIS GUY.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.379
MOM, BEN IS NOT A CRIMINAL.
HE WORKS IN FINANCE.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.881
WHITE COLLAR CRIME
IS STILL A CRIME, DEAR.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.250
BRENNA,
I JUST WANT TO SAY--

10:18.284 --> 10:19.919
PLEASE,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.355
CAN WE JUST PRETEND
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.856
THAT'S NOT A HEALTHY WAY
FOR US TO PROCESS THIS.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.926
AND THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO BE TRAUMATIZED

10:25.958 --> 10:27.259
BY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.296
I'M NOT TRAUMATIZED.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.797
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
HAVE TO USE THESE

10:30.831 --> 10:33.000
EXTREME THERAPY WORDS
FOR EVERYTHING?

10:33.033 --> 10:35.268
I JUST THINK
WE ALL HAVE TO
GET USED TO THE IDEA

10:35.302 --> 10:37.971
THAT BEN COULD BE SPENDING
A LOT MORE TIME AROUND HERE.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.239
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S REALLY ONLY
ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.640
KILL HIM?

10:42.842 --> 10:45.211
YOU SHOULD ALL MEET HIM,
OFFICIALLY,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.213
FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:47.246 --> 10:49.149
UM...
ARE TOPS OPTIONAL?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.418
( chucking )

10:51.650 --> 10:55.422
I HAD MY SHIRT ON!

11:04.063 --> 11:06.099
APRIL, HEY.
YOU GOT A SEC?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.967
HEY, MALLORY.
HOW YOU DOING?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.235
OH, I'M EXHAUSTED.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.038
I'M DATING THIS GUY
WHO'S SUPER INTO TANTRIC SEX,

11:12.072 --> 11:13.373
AND I'M JUST LIKE
"GET OFF ME.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.243
I HAVE TO GO TO BED,"
YOU KNOW?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.711
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

11:17.744 --> 11:20.113
YES. SO, IN LIGHT OF
THE GOVERNOR'S SEX SCANDAL,

11:20.147 --> 11:22.048
I'M WORKING ON THIS ARTICLE.
IT'S SORT OF

11:22.081 --> 11:23.216
A "SEX IN THE OFFICE"
KIND OF PIECE.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.817
AND I'M QUIZZING
PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.421
WHERE IS THE WILDEST PLACE
YOU HAVE EVER HAD SEX?

11:27.453 --> 11:29.221
( chuckles )

11:29.255 --> 11:31.357
THIS IS TOTALLY ANONYMOUS.
SO LET IT RIP.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.360
IN A DORM ROOM.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.196
( laughs )

11:36.229 --> 11:38.197
OH.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.932
I SHOULD GET
BACK TO WORK.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.735
NO NO NO NO, WAIT.
JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.736
NUMBER OF SEXUAL PARTNERS.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING,

11:43.769 --> 11:45.205
SINGLE DIGITS,
DOUBLE DIGITS,

11:45.238 --> 11:46.206
TRIPLE?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.240
THREE.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.743
HUNDRED?

11:49.775 --> 11:50.876
NO, THREE GUYS.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.379
JUST GUYS?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.748
I'VE BEEN
WITH FIVE WOMEN.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.216
LAST QUESTION.

11:57.250 --> 12:02.089
EVER ENGAGE IN
AN INTER-OFFICE ROMANCE?

12:02.121 --> 12:03.222
- NO.
- HMM.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.091
SMART.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.826
I GOT TOTALLY SCREWED OVER
BY DOMINIC

12:06.860 --> 12:09.096
AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY
LAST YEAR.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.030
UM, DOMINIC?

12:11.063 --> 12:13.133
LIKE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
DOMINIC?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.101
YEAH.
HE IS THE WORST.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.070
DOMINIC SLEEPS WITH EVERYONE.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.371
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU
HAVEN'T GOTTEN SUCKED IN YET.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.441
( chuckles )
OR I GUESS

12:21.475 --> 12:23.777
HE HASN'T GOTTEN
SUCKED IN YET.

12:23.809 --> 12:24.977
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE--

12:25.010 --> 12:27.346
NO, I GET IT.
I GET IT.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.856
- Beth: Hello?
- HE'S A PLAYER, BETH.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.524
- Beth: Who?
- DOMINIC.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.993
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

12:40.025 --> 12:42.328
April:
I found out
he sleeps around.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.331
SO I DID A LITTLE DIGGING...

12:44.364 --> 12:47.466
THIS GUY'S LIFE IS LIKE
A BEER COMMERCIAL.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.068
YEAH, WE'VE STALKED HIM
ONLINE BEFORE.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.403
YEAH, BUT WE NEVER
CROSS-REFERENCED

12:50.437 --> 12:52.139
INSTAGRAM, TWITTER,
AND VINE BEFORE.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.240
Three weeks ago
Courtney commented

12:54.274 --> 12:56.475
THAT SHE WAS "STILL TIRED
FROM LAST NIGHT."

12:56.509 --> 12:57.977
DOT DOT DOT.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.513
- And a month before that...
- ( chuckles )

12:59.546 --> 13:01.548
SOME GIRL NAMED SARAH SOPHIE
TAGGED HIM BACKSTAGE

13:01.780 --> 13:03.015
AT THAT PHOENIX SHOW.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.085
IT'S LIKE EVERYWHERE HE GOES,

13:05.118 --> 13:07.120
HE JUST TRIPS AND FALLS
ON SOME GIRL WITH BANGS.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.022
WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN
DOMINIC LATELY?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.823
April:
What do you mean?

13:10.856 --> 13:12.958
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU DATE PEOPLE
WHO LOOK LIKE THAT.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.927
- OTHER PEOPLE WANT THEM.
- April: Yeah, well...

13:14.961 --> 13:16.129
APPARENTLY
HE WANTS THEM TOO.

13:16.163 --> 13:19.032
AND I'M TRYING TO
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF HERE.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.100
I CAN'T BE STRESSING OUT
LOOKING AT PICTURES

13:21.134 --> 13:24.037
OF HIM AND CHLOE
AT HER BEACH HOUSE.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.371
THEY HIKED IN THE DUNES.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.573
THEY BOTH GOT POISON IVY.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.311
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T
SEE THIS GOING ANYWHERE.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.412
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD SEX WITH HIM.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.914
I KNOW.
THAT PART SUCKS.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.383
Beth:
Well, you still could.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.384
- WHAT?
- YOU'VE BEEN STRESSING ABOUT

13:38.418 --> 13:40.386
WHEN TO TELL HIM YOU'RE SICK
AND HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,

13:40.419 --> 13:42.188
SO IF YOU REALLY DON'T
SEE THIS GOING ANYWHERE,

13:42.221 --> 13:43.322
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING

13:43.355 --> 13:44.990
BUT HAVING FUN WITH HIM.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.128
THIS IS LIBERATING.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.596
OKAY.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.264
I GOTTA GO MAKE ART
OUT OF HOT MILK NOW.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.532
EW.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.201
- LOVE YOU.
- April: Love you too.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.274
SORRY THAT TOOK SO LONG.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.876
THE SUGAR PACKET GUY
WAS BEING REALLY UNREASONABLE.

14:03.909 --> 14:07.581
YOU'D THINK HE'D BE NICER.
I MEAN, RIGHT?

14:08.914 --> 14:09.916
SUGAR.

14:13.385 --> 14:14.520
HOW ARE WE DOING HERE?

14:14.553 --> 14:16.423
SO...

14:16.456 --> 14:17.957
MOST OF THE SHOPS IN TOWN

14:17.990 --> 14:20.559
ARE GOING TO BE DOING
LEAVES OR A HEART.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.428
I THINK WE COULD BE
MORE IMAGINATIVE.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.563
HERE AT DIESEL,
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING

14:24.597 --> 14:27.500
THE WAVY HEART.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.969
Kieran:
COULD BE WORSE.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.903
COULD IT?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.972
WHAT COULD BE WORSE
THAN SEEING YOUR MOM

14:33.005 --> 14:35.375
GET GROPED BY SOME GUY
IN PLEATED KHAKIS?

14:35.408 --> 14:36.976
AT LEAST HIS
KHAKIS WERE ON.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.178
THANKS.
NOW I JUST PICTURED THEM OFF.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.647
I WALKED IN
ON MY PARENTS ONCE.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.915
ACTUALLY HAVING SEX?

14:42.948 --> 14:44.584
WELL, SEX ADJACENT.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.052
LET'S JUST SAY
HIS HEAD WAS IN HER LAP.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.520
AND YOU CAN
STOP RIGHT THERE.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.389
THANKSGIVINGS
WERE NEVER THE SAME.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.557
( chuckles )

14:52.558 --> 14:54.059
WELL, AT LEAST THEY
WERE BOTH YOUR PARENTS,

14:54.094 --> 14:55.662
NOT YOUR MOM
AND SOME RANDOM.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.398
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
IS HE DATING SOMEONE TOO OR...?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.533
NO.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.437
ACTUALLY, MY DAD DIED.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.407
SORRY.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.375
I JUST ASSUMED YOUR PARENTS
WERE DIVORCED OR SOMETHING,

15:09.408 --> 15:10.543
'CAUSE EVERYONE'S
PARENTS ARE.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.278
NO, IT'S OKAY.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.948
HE DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

15:17.116 --> 15:21.421
ANYWAY, THIS DINNER TONIGHT
SHOULD BE SUPER AWKWARD.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.690
WELL, LET ME KNOW
IF IT GETS REALLY
UNBEARABLE

15:23.923 --> 15:25.091
AND YOU NEED TO ESCAPE.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.995
I'LL COME BREAK YOU OUT.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.697
I'LL CREATE A DIVERSION,
PRETEND LIKE I'M STEALING

15:30.929 --> 15:32.231
THE FAMILY JEWELS
OR SOMETHING...

15:32.264 --> 15:34.167
- ( chuckles )
- ...WHILE YOU SNEAK
OUT THE BACK.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.269
FAMILY JEWELS?

15:36.302 --> 15:37.303
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.370
YOU LIVE IN BEACON HILL.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.938
BUT SERIOUSLY,

15:39.972 --> 15:43.442
IF YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU NEED
SOME MORAL SUPPORT,

15:43.475 --> 15:45.245
I'M DOWN TO BE
YOUR PLUS ONE.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.990
SO HOW MANY REPEAT CUSTOMERS
WOULD YOU SAY

15:57.023 --> 15:58.325
YOU HAVE IN A WEEK?

15:58.357 --> 16:01.126
I WOULD SAY THAT IS
THE LIFEBLOOD OF MY BUSINESS.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.263
UM, I DON'T HAVE
MANY CUSTOMERS,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.698
BUT THE ONES I DO HAVE
KEEP COMING BACK.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.167
YOU DID.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.735
IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'M
WRITING A STORY ABOUT YOU.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.537
OH, YOU ALSO LIKE THE JUICE.
I CAN TELL.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.304
YOU'RE MORE FOCUSED TODAY.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.341
- I AM?
- WOULD YOU JUST PLAY ALONG
AND SAY YOU ARE?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.475
( chuckles )

16:16.509 --> 16:18.077
THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I'M ACTUALLY

16:18.110 --> 16:19.412
HELPING PEOPLE
WITH THIS STUFF,

16:19.446 --> 16:22.615
WHICH WOULD HELP ME
FORGIVE THE CANCER.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.317
HOW DO YOU
FORGIVE CANCER?

16:25.351 --> 16:27.153
WELL, CANCER LED ME
TO THE JUICE,

16:27.187 --> 16:28.620
AND IF THE JUICE
IS HELPING PEOPLE,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.990
THEN IT GIVES ME SOME
REASON AS TO WHY

16:31.024 --> 16:33.225
ALL OF THIS IS
HAPPENING TO ME.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.562
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHY
THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU

16:35.595 --> 16:38.630
IS ONE OF
THE HARDEST THINGS...

16:38.664 --> 16:40.767
- IT'S SOUNDS LIKE.
- YEAH.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.634
IT HELPS THAT
THERE ARE CUSTOMERS

16:42.668 --> 16:43.736
TO TALK ABOUT IT TO.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.505
THERE'S RITA
WITH BREAST CANCER,

16:46.538 --> 16:49.576
DENNIS WITH MELANOMA,

16:49.609 --> 16:52.379
LEWIS WITH LYMPHOMA.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.679
( phone beeps )

16:55.682 --> 16:58.784
UM, APRIL WITH LEUKEMIA.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.522
I DIDN'T TELL YOU EARLIER
'CAUSE I'M NOT REALLY USED TO--

17:02.554 --> 17:03.623
TO SAYING IT.

17:03.655 --> 17:06.259
HOW LONG SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED?

17:06.291 --> 17:07.660
ABOUT A WEEK.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.229
I'M SORRY, KID.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.199
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:13.232 --> 17:15.134
HOW DID YOUR FAMILY
REACT TO THE NEWS?

17:15.167 --> 17:18.771
- I HAVEN'T TOLD THEM YET.
- THAT'S OKAY.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.608
DON'T FEEL ANY SHAME ABOUT
WHO YOU TELL AND WHEN.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.545
I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'M LYING TO THEM,
YOU KNOW?

17:25.577 --> 17:29.682
NO, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE TIME
TO GET YOUR OWN HEAD AROUND IT,

17:29.715 --> 17:32.551
BUT DON'T DENY YOURSELF
A SUPPORT SYSTEM.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.487
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
GOING TO A SUPPORT GROUP?

17:34.520 --> 17:37.557
I'M NOT REALLY
THE SUPPORT-GROUP TYPE,

17:37.589 --> 17:39.692
BUT I TOLD MY BEST FRIEND
AND SHE'S SUPPORTIVE.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.427
DOES SHE HAVE CANCER?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.296
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

17:43.328 --> 17:46.699
YOU GOTTA BE AROUND PEOPLE
WHO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE
YOU'RE SPEAKING...

17:46.732 --> 17:48.500
LIKE ME.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.573
THE BEST ADVICE
THAT I CAN GIVE YOU:

17:53.605 --> 17:56.576
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH
PEOPLE WHO CAN HANDLE IT,

17:56.608 --> 17:59.077
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT TO HANDLE.

18:01.079 --> 18:05.585
MY LAST ROUND OF CHEMO,
I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.253
MY BODY WENT
INTO SEPTIC SHOCK.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.423
THE DOCTORS CALLED IN
MY WIFE, MY KIDS.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.494
I WAS PREPARED... TO DIE.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.598
NOW OBVIOUSLY
I TURNED A CORNER,

18:19.632 --> 18:22.602
BUT MY WIFE DORIS WAS--

18:22.634 --> 18:25.738
SHE WAS THERE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.409
I-- I WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT WITHOUT HER.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.749
Arianna:
I CAN TELL SHE'S JUDGING ME.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.618
I MEAN, SHE THINKS
SHE'S SUPERIOR TO ME

18:39.652 --> 18:42.154
AND WANTS ME TO KNOW
THAT NO MATTER WHAT I DO

18:42.188 --> 18:44.156
SHE'LL NEVER RESPECT ME.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.625
OKAY. WELL,
LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK

18:46.659 --> 18:48.760
AND EXAMINE WHY YOU GIVE
YOUR ASSISTANT SO MUCH

18:48.795 --> 18:50.630
POWER OVER YOUR EMOTIONS.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.565
I DON'T GIVE HER
THE POWER.

18:52.598 --> 18:53.766
SHE HAS IT
EVERY DAY OF HER LIFE.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.768
SHE'S 22 YEARS OLD
WITH A D-CUP.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.670
SHE RULES THE WORLD.
( scoffs )

18:57.703 --> 18:59.806
AND WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU MAKE EVERYTHING
ABOUT AGE.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.773
'CAUSE I'M A 50-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

19:01.807 --> 19:03.910
ABOUT TO ENTER
THE DATING SCENE AGAIN.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.845
I'M SCREWED.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.212
SO THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR DIVORCE.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.884
ARIANNA, BELIEVE ME,

19:10.916 --> 19:12.251
I UNDERSTAND WHERE
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.720
BUT I PROMISE YOU
IT'S NOT THAT DIRE

19:13.752 --> 19:15.188
WHEN YOU PUT
YOURSELF OUT THERE.

19:15.221 --> 19:18.657
THERE ARE WONDERFUL MEN
FOR WOMEN OF EVERY AGE.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.661
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
SIGNING UP FOR AN
ONLINE DATING SITE?

19:21.693 --> 19:23.328
( groans )

19:23.363 --> 19:24.797
THAT'S THE LAST
THING I NEED--

19:24.830 --> 19:26.398
TO SEE BEN'S
PICTURE UP THERE

19:26.432 --> 19:29.402
SOLICITING SEX FROM
EVERY WOMAN IN BOSTON.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.904
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME
WAS BRIAN.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.740
NO, BRIAN WAS
MY FIRST HUSBAND.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.276
BEN'S THE MAN WHO
LEFT ME SIX MONTHS AGO.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.809
SORRY, RIGHT.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.444
RIGHT.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.682
WHAT DID YOU SAY
BEN DOES FOR A LIVING?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.551
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
HAVE IT IN MY NOTES.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.185
IT MIGHT BE RELEVANT.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.555
HE WORKS IN FINANCE.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.289
OH.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.692
AND WOMEN LOVE THAT.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.827
MY SON TOLD ME BEN
HAS BEEN ON THREE
DATES ALREADY

19:55.862 --> 19:57.297
WITH THE SAME WOMAN.

19:57.329 --> 20:00.866
APPARENTLY HE TOOK HER
TO SOME FLAMENCO PERFORMANCE.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.835
( beeps, whirs down )

20:02.868 --> 20:04.871
( sighs )
I HATE YOU.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.378
COPIER'S JAMMED.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAIT A MINUTE.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.949
YOU'RE ALWAYS
MAKING ME WAIT.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.317
OH, HI.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.786
SO WHERE'S THE PAPER STUCK?

20:19.818 --> 20:21.820
I DON'T KNOW.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.390
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

20:24.423 --> 20:25.857
IT MIGHT BE IN BETWEEN--

20:25.892 --> 20:27.727
- OH, YEAH.
- ( mutters )

20:27.759 --> 20:28.827
LET ME SEE
OVER THERE.

20:28.861 --> 20:29.895
WHERE DO YOU SEE--

20:33.432 --> 20:35.734
WHY DON'T YOU COME TALK
TO ME IN THE SUPPLY ROOM?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.737
ITS DOOR LOCKS.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.739
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE
DONE THAT BEFORE.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.273
- WHAT?
- Paul: EXCUSE ME?

20:41.307 --> 20:43.409
UH, PAUL, HI.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.943
THE COPIER'S JAMMED.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.011
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.548
I'M GONNA TRY THE ONE
IN CLASSIFIEDS.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.781
OKAY,
WE'LL TALK LATER.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.557
MOM, WHAT HAPPENED?

20:58.590 --> 20:59.826
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
BE HOME AN HOUR AGO.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.594
DON'T GET ME STARTED.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.564
IT'S TOO LATE.
I'M STARTED.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.566
PEARL BROUGHT A NEW FRIEND

21:06.598 --> 21:08.300
AS HER BRIDGE PARTNER,

21:08.334 --> 21:09.301
CLAIMING SHE WAS
HER ROOMMATE

21:09.335 --> 21:11.503
ON THEIR LAST
ELDER HOSTEL TRIP.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.771
SHE WAS A RINGER,

21:12.805 --> 21:14.039
A LIFE MASTER.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.808
I'M OUT 200 BUCKS.
I COULD JUST--

21:16.843 --> 21:19.378
AW, MOM, I THOUGHT
WE AGREED YOU WEREN'T
GONNA BET REAL MONEY.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.048
I SHOULD WASH UP
FOR DINNER.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.715
WAIT, I NEED YOUR HELP.
I'M HAVING A CRISIS.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.385
TECHNICALLY, I SHOULD ONLY
DISCUSS THIS WITH A COLLEAGUE.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.587
- OKAY.
- I JUST FOUND OUT

21:28.621 --> 21:30.856
MY NEW PATIENT IS
ABOUT TO GET A DIVORCE

21:30.890 --> 21:32.525
FROM BEN,
WHO'S GONNA BE HERE

21:32.557 --> 21:33.692
IN 15 MINUTES.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.894
SO STOP SEEING
YOUR PATIENT.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.364
NO, I WOULD NEVER PUT
MY PERSONAL LIFE
BEFORE A PATIENT.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.333
SO STOP SEEING
YOUR PSYCHO.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.933
I DON'T WANT TO.
I LIKE HIM.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.069
AND EVEN THOUGH
IT'S KIND OF EARLY,

21:44.302 --> 21:45.538
I THINK WE BOTH
KIND OF FEEL LIKE

21:45.570 --> 21:47.839
THERE'S THIS POTENTIAL
FOR THIS TO BE SOMETHING.

21:47.874 --> 21:48.941
HOW SURE ARE YOU?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.876
WE JUST STARTED DATING.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.310
( doorbell rings )

21:52.345 --> 21:54.947
I GOT IT.
IT'S FOR ME.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.749
Emma:
DECIDE AFTER DINNER.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.917
EITHER SHE GOES
OR HE GOES.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.920
AND AT THE END
OF THE NIGHT,

22:00.952 --> 22:02.989
ONLY ONE OF THEM
WILL RECEIVE A ROSE.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.089
WHAT?

22:04.323 --> 22:07.359
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T WATCH REALITY TV.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.594
YOU READ.

22:08.627 --> 22:10.462
Brenna: HEY, MOM?
CAN MY FRIEND KIERAN

22:10.496 --> 22:12.597
JOIN US FOR DINNER?

22:12.632 --> 22:15.034
SURE.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.640
ANYONE ELSE WANT ANYTHING
WHILE I'M UP?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.375
- NO, I'M GOOD.
- NO, THANK YOU.

22:22.407 --> 22:25.111
SO, APRIL, YOU TAKING PART
IN THE WHOLE JUICING FAD?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.113
THIS?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.115
YES, I AM.

22:29.347 --> 22:32.351
I WORSHIP AT THE ALTAR
OF GWYNETH PALTROW.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.653
( chuckles )
SINCE WHEN?

22:33.685 --> 22:36.455
Sara:
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT JUICING?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.458
DOES THAT MEAN HEALTH
IS A TOP PRIORITY

22:38.490 --> 22:39.659
FOR YOU IN LIFE?

22:39.692 --> 22:41.126
WHAT ARE SOME OF
YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES,

22:41.359 --> 22:42.461
IF YOU HAD TO SAY?

22:42.494 --> 22:43.996
UH... WELL,

22:44.029 --> 22:46.065
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
HEALTH AND FITNESS.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.000
I STARTED PILATES
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.001
I'M THE ONLY
MAN IN MY CLASS.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.871
I WOULD LOVE
TO TRY PILATES.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.138
MAYBE YOU'LL TAKE ME
WITH YOU SOMETIME.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.474
OKAY, BUT YOU MIGHT
BREAK UP WITH ME

22:55.508 --> 22:57.143
WHEN YOU SEE
HOW INFLEXIBLE I AM,

22:57.375 --> 22:58.443
LITERALLY.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.546
( laughs )

23:05.718 --> 23:07.987
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
MET A MAN THAT DOES PILATES.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.124
YOU SAID YOU WORKED
IN FINANCE, BEN?

23:11.156 --> 23:13.759
- YES.
- Brenna: WE WORK IN
A TATTOO PARLOR.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.994
AS YOU CAN TELL.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.696
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY FRESH.

23:17.730 --> 23:18.698
( mouths )

23:18.730 --> 23:20.866
THIS ONE MEANS ANARCHY.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.069
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S JUST A STAR.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.904
AND WHAT IS THAT
ONE ON YOUR CHEST?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.141
IT'S A MATH FORMULA,
IT'S IN REFERENCE TO--

23:28.173 --> 23:30.675
KIERAN DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN COLLEGE.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.145
HE THINKS IT'S
A WASTE OF MONEY.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.814
UH, THAT'S NOT IT.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.883
PERSONALLY I BELIEVE
THAT I SHOULD CREATE
MY OWN--

23:36.915 --> 23:40.153
SO, BEN, MY MOM
TOLD ME YOUR SON
GOES TO STANFORD?

23:40.185 --> 23:43.189
- Ben: YEAH.
- THAT'S LIKE CRAZY
EXPENSIVE, RIGHT?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.894
IT'S A REALLY GOOD
SCHOOL, THOUGH.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.163
THIS CHICKEN'S
REALLY GOOD, MOM.

23:50.195 --> 23:52.565
YEAH, YEAH.
ANYTIME I CAN GET
CHICKEN THESE DAYS

23:52.597 --> 23:53.833
IT'S A REAL TREAT.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.667
MY EX-WIFE WAS ALLERGIC.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.869
OH, YOU'RE DIVORCED?
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:57.903 --> 23:59.105
( Ben chuckles )

23:59.137 --> 24:00.839
UH, WELL,
THAT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.909
BEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.880
BUT DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL EVER REMARRY?

24:07.913 --> 24:09.714
I MEAN,
IN THE FUTURE,

24:09.749 --> 24:11.183
HYPOTHETICALLY?

24:11.217 --> 24:13.885
UH, UM...

24:13.920 --> 24:15.721
I'M NOT SURE.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.589
MOM, WHY DON'T YOU COME
HELP ME WITH DESSERT?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.659
OH, EXCUSE ME.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.663
( whispering )
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:24.696 --> 24:26.932
WHAT?
AM I BEING TOO INTENSE?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.733
OKAY, SO YOU'RE AWARE
YOU'RE DOING IT.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.001
WHY ARE YOU
ACTING LIKE THIS?

24:30.036 --> 24:31.537
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET A SENSE OF

24:31.570 --> 24:33.038
WHERE THIS
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.673
YOU GUYS JUST
STARTED DATING.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.741
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS NOW?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.877
I HAVE MY REASONS.

24:38.911 --> 24:42.080
WELL, WHATEVER THEY ARE,
YOU ARE BEING WAY TOO INTENSE.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.749
JUST CHILL OUT.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.550
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE FUN PART.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.885
OKAY.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.894
- ( April sighs )
- Sara: WHO'S THAT?

24:54.926 --> 24:56.695
JUST THIS GUY
FROM WORK.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.231
OH, HE'S CUTE.
ARE YOU DATING?

24:59.265 --> 25:00.766
YEAH.

25:00.799 --> 25:01.901
I DON'T KNOW.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.237
( sighs )

25:04.269 --> 25:06.239
I HAVE TO GO.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.974
WELL, I-- I HAVE TO CHANGE.
FIRST I'VE GOT TO CHANGE.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.643
( sighs )

25:11.810 --> 25:13.011
I FEEL CRAZY!

25:13.045 --> 25:14.779
YOU SOUND CRAZY.

25:14.814 --> 25:15.948
April:
It's not like me
to get so jealous.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.782
I WANT TO BEAT THOSE GIRLS.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.819
I WANT TO WIN.
OH MY GOD.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.788
LISTEN TO ME.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

25:23.823 --> 25:26.592
NOTHING. I'M KIND OF LOVING
YOU LIKE THIS, ACTUALLY.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.260
JUST REMEMBER
IF DOMINIC'S A PLAYER,

25:28.294 --> 25:29.996
YOU GET TO PLAY RIGHT BACK.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.931
TOTALLY. YEAH.

25:31.963 --> 25:33.798
HOW DO I DO THAT?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.800
Beth: Be detached.
You don't care that much.

25:35.835 --> 25:36.935
YOU DON'T GET JEALOUS.
YOU JUST GET WHATEVER YOU WANT

25:36.969 --> 25:38.270
AND THEN YOU MOVE ON.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.105
OKAY. DONE.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.107
SO WHAT DO I WEAR?

25:42.141 --> 25:43.910
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'D
NORMALLY WEAR ON A DATE.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.650
GOT IT.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.151
NOW WEAR THE OPPOSITE.

25:58.790 --> 26:01.126
( crowd chattering )

26:05.664 --> 26:06.999
YEAH, SEE YOU LATER.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.236
YOU MADE IT.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.903
- YEAH, SORRY I'M LATE.
- NO, IT'S COOL.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.038
I JUST FINISHED
THE INTERVIEW.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.839
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

26:14.874 --> 26:15.974
I DIDN'T PLAN ANYTHING.

26:16.008 --> 26:16.976
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE COMING.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.778
REALLY, WHY NOT?

26:18.810 --> 26:21.814
EARLIER, YOU SEEMED
A LITTLE OFF.

26:21.846 --> 26:23.982
DOM.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.718
WHAT ARE WE
DOING LATER?

26:25.750 --> 26:26.986
WE CAN'T
JUST GO HOME.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.019
April:
I KNOW, RIGHT?

26:28.054 --> 26:30.189
HE JUST LOOKS
TOO HOT TONIGHT.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.330
BUT HE IS GOING HOME...

26:38.364 --> 26:39.865
WITH ME.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.232
YOU CAN HAVE HIM
ANOTHER NIGHT.

26:42.835 --> 26:43.836
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

26:45.837 --> 26:47.339
OH, NO.
JUST LEAVE THESE.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.874
I'LL JUST TAKE THOSE.

26:48.907 --> 26:52.111
I'LL GET THESE TOMORROW.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.012
UH...

26:54.046 --> 26:56.382
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

26:56.615 --> 27:01.252
OH, OKAY.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.688
WELL...

27:02.721 --> 27:04.323
BEFORE YOU GO,
THEN LET ME JUST SAY

27:04.356 --> 27:07.125
I'M SORRY IF TONIGHT
WAS A LITTLE STRANGE
FOR YOU.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.729
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
BUT IN CASE YOU DID.

27:09.761 --> 27:12.865
- UH...
- I KNOW. IT'S OKAY.

27:12.897 --> 27:16.035
I WAS PROBABLY
A LITTLE INTENSE.

27:16.067 --> 27:17.068
AHH.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.374
SARA...
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.344
THIS WAS JUST A LOT
ALL AT ONCE.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.346
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF YOU RAN SCREAMING

27:27.380 --> 27:28.881
FROM THE HOUSE
AFTER THIS.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.215
I DO HAVE TO GO,

27:30.249 --> 27:32.718
BUT I AM NOT
RUNNING AND SCREAMING.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.353
GREAT. ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S GREAT.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.221
SO WE'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.355
WE LIKE EACH OTHER

27:37.390 --> 27:39.357
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA
CONTINUE TO SEE

27:39.392 --> 27:41.359
WHERE THIS GOES
WITH NO PRESSURE...

27:41.394 --> 27:43.695
UNLESS ASKING YOU
TO AGREE TO THAT

27:43.729 --> 27:44.896
COUNTS AS PRESSURE,
IN WHICH CASE

27:44.930 --> 27:47.432
YOU DO NOT
HAVE TO ANSWER.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.901
THANKS FOR DINNER.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.703
ANYTIME.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.373
OR ANYTIME
AFTER YOU'RE READY.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.409
NO RUSH.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.980
Brenna: DID YOU SEE
THE LOOK ON BEN'S FACE

28:02.013 --> 28:03.915
WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO ACT
LIKE HE LIKED YOUR TATTOOS?

28:03.949 --> 28:06.251
THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.854
WHAT WORD DID HE USE
TO DESCRIBE IT AGAIN?

28:08.887 --> 28:09.989
I DON'T KNOW.

28:10.021 --> 28:14.393
IT WAS LIKE "FUNKY"
OR SOMETHING SUPER LAME.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.262
OH MY GOD. WHEN I TOLD HIM
WHERE YOU USED TO
HAVE A PIERCING--

28:17.296 --> 28:18.463
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

28:18.696 --> 28:19.798
- WAIT, REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.400
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.803
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

28:27.972 --> 28:29.741
I CAME HERE TONIGHT
TO DINNER

28:29.775 --> 28:31.143
JUST TO BE THERE FOR YOU,

28:31.176 --> 28:32.478
NOT SO THAT YOU CAN
USE ME TO PISS OFF
YOUR FAMILY.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.113
KIERAN, THAT'S NOT WHY--

28:34.145 --> 28:35.881
YOU KNOW...

28:35.914 --> 28:37.883
IF IT WAS MY MOM
AND SHE WAS OUT THERE,

28:37.916 --> 28:40.086
ALONE,
TRYING TO MEET SOMEONE...

28:42.922 --> 28:44.890
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
FORGET IT.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.026
I THINK WE'RE
JUST DIFFERENT.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.066
WANT A GLASS
OF WINE OR SOMETHING?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.478
OKAY.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.113
HANG ON A SECOND.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.048
LET'S GO TO YOUR ROOM.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.849
APRIL, CAN WE JUST TALK?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.384
I THOUGHT I WAS
THE GIRL HERE.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.221
MM. WAIT.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.056
APRIL.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.790
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

29:18.824 --> 29:19.924
WHAT, WHENEVER
YOU WANT TO HOOK UP

29:19.959 --> 29:21.059
I'M SUPPOSED TO
JUST GO FOR IT,

29:21.093 --> 29:22.795
BUT WHEN I DO,
YOU SAY "NO"?

29:22.827 --> 29:23.929
CONSIDERING
YOUR DATING HISTORY,

29:23.962 --> 29:25.064
I'M GETTING SOME
MIXED SIGNALS HERE.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.397
MY DATING HISTORY?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.900
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.234
IT'S FINE.
IT'S COOL.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.935
I HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU.
I GET WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

29:30.970 --> 29:32.438
AND I'M COOL WITH THAT.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.942
HAVE I TREATED YOU BADLY?

29:36.976 --> 29:38.243
- WHAT?
- NO, REALLY, APRIL.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.944
HAVE I LIED TO YOU?

29:39.979 --> 29:42.147
HAVE I DONE ANYTHING
TO DISRESPECT YOU?

29:44.182 --> 29:45.951
OR DOES THAT NOT EVEN
MATTER TO YOU?

29:45.984 --> 29:49.822
I'M JUST-- I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING MORE REAL
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.957
WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
THAT DOESN'T TREAT ME LIKE THIS.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.425
SO MAYBE THIS IS JUST NOT WHAT
EITHER OF US IS LOOKING FOR.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.261
( door opens )

29:56.295 --> 29:58.163
GUESS WHO JUST WAITED
FOR ARCADE FIRE TICKETS

29:58.197 --> 29:59.365
FOR THREE HOURS,

29:59.397 --> 30:00.833
AND ALMOST HAD TO
PUNCH A PRIEST

30:00.865 --> 30:02.233
TO GET THE LAST TICKET?

30:02.268 --> 30:03.434
IT'S LIKE "I'M SORRY DUDE.
I DON'T CARE IF

30:03.469 --> 30:04.970
YOU'RE A MAN OF THE CLOTH,

30:05.003 --> 30:06.438
CUTTING IN LINE IS NOT
WHAT JESUS WOULD DO."

30:08.473 --> 30:10.209
YOU GUYS IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING?

30:10.241 --> 30:12.111
NO.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.012
NO, APRIL WAS JUST
ON HER WAY OUT.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.021
( door opens )

30:23.055 --> 30:24.190
( fist thuds )

30:25.391 --> 30:27.559
SO I THINK
I DODGED A BULLET.

30:27.593 --> 30:30.095
I MEAN, IF THIS IS HOW DOMINIC
HANDLES A STRONG WOMAN,

30:30.128 --> 30:33.031
NO WONDER HE HASN'T HAD
A REAL RELATIONSHIP IN YEARS.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.165
RIGHT. YOU SAID
HE GOT OFFENDED

30:34.200 --> 30:35.366
WHEN YOU TRIED
TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT SEX,

30:35.401 --> 30:38.403
'CAUSE THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY
SOUND LIKE A PLAYER.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.375
WELL, WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T--
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER NOW.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.044
IT'S OVER,

30:45.076 --> 30:47.346
AND I'M TOTALLY
OKAY WITH THAT.

30:47.378 --> 30:50.915
I DEFINITELY DON'T NEED
ANY MORE STRESS IN MY LIFE.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.317
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.054
YEAH, EXCEPT YOU.

30:55.086 --> 30:56.521
YOU'RE DOING THE SAME
THING YOU ALWAYS DO.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.923
WHAT AM I DOING?

30:57.957 --> 30:59.924
UH, THIS.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.492
YOU LOOK FOR REASONS
NOT TO BE WITH GUYS.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.063
IT'S CALLED HAVING
HIGH STANDARDS.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.397
NO, IT'S NOT.
FROM WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME NOW,

31:06.432 --> 31:08.200
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE ACTUALLY
REALLY LIKES YOU,

31:08.233 --> 31:09.401
AND YOU'RE JUST
TALKING YOURSELF
OUT OF IT.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.938
- HE'S SLEPT WITH LIKE--
- SLEPT. PAST TENSE.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.606
HE'S A HOT GUY, OKAY?
IF I WERE THAT DUDE,

31:14.640 --> 31:16.407
I WOULD BE GETTING LAID
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

31:16.442 --> 31:19.345
- UNTIL I FOUND THE ONE.
- BUT I'M NOT THE ONE.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.580
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- BECAUSE I'M SICK.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.148
SO? YOU'RE GONNA
GET BETTER.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.218
WHAT IF I DON'T?

31:26.251 --> 31:29.087
WELL THEN...

31:29.121 --> 31:32.090
ALL THE MORE REASON THEN
TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU
HAVE NEVER DONE--

31:32.124 --> 31:34.125
TAKE A REAL RISK.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.961
PLEASE.

31:35.994 --> 31:38.096
I TAKE RISKS
ALL THE TIME.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.431
I CRASHED A BLOOD DRIVE
LAST WEEK--

31:39.464 --> 31:40.898
YEAH, YOU TAKE RISKS
AT WORK,

31:40.932 --> 31:42.034
NOT IN
YOU'RE LOVE LIFE.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.104
YOU-- GOD, YOU ALWAYS
FIND A REASON TO BAIL.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.038
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT, AP.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.106
YOU'RE GONNA
TALK TO ME ABOUT

31:48.140 --> 31:49.208
COMMITMENT ISSUES?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.175
YOU CAN'T EVEN STAY
IN A COUNTRY

31:51.210 --> 31:53.045
FOR MORE THAN
TWO YEARS.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.047
YOU ARE ONE OF THE
SMARTEST PEOPLE I KNOW,

31:55.079 --> 31:56.981
YET YOU'RE TOTALLY AVOIDING
TRYING TO FIND A CAREER

31:57.016 --> 31:58.317
THAT COULD ACTUALLY
GO SOMEWHERE.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.952
INSTEAD YOU'D RATHER
SIT HERE MAKING CHAI LATTES

32:00.986 --> 32:03.288
AND FOAM ART
AND SLEEPING WITH
YOUR EX-BOYFRIENDS.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.324
YOU THINK THAT'S
TAKING REAL RISKS?

32:08.493 --> 32:11.163
WOW.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.999
I'M SORRY,
THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.534
YEAH, IT WAS.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.305
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN YOU'RE WRONG.

32:21.339 --> 32:24.143
HEY, STAN?

32:24.175 --> 32:26.144
YOU READY
TO CLOSE UP?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.247
YEAH. PERMANENTLY.

32:30.214 --> 32:31.250
I QUIT.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.251
UH, BETH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:33.285 --> 32:34.686
I'VE BEEN WORKING HERE
FOR TOO LONG.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.154
I'M USING IT
AS A CRUTCH.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.222
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE A RISK

32:38.257 --> 32:39.424
AND TRY SOMETHING
MORE CHALLENGING.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.127
SO AS MUCH AS IT PAINS
MY WAVY HEART TO SAY IT,

32:43.162 --> 32:44.663
IT'S TIME.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.565
April:
BETH, YOU'LL BE
UNEMPLOYED.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.567
YOU'LL HAVE NO INCOME.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.134
AND I ALSO WON'T
HAVE ANY REGRETS.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.604
I DARE YOU
TO DO THE SAME.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.347
Sara:
AND I WANTED
TO START BY SAYING

33:02.381 --> 33:05.183
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED GETTING
TO KNOW YOU OVER THESE LAST
FEW SESSIONS.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.251
IT'S ALWAYS EXCITING
TAKING ON NEW PATIENTS.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.188
AND...

33:09.221 --> 33:13.057
I THOUGHT THAT I HAD
MORE TIME IN MY SCHEDULE

33:13.092 --> 33:15.661
TO COMMIT TO SOMEONE NEW
EVERY WEEK.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.430
- AND I JUST--
I'M REALIZING--
- ( laughs ) WAIT, WAIT.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.199
DR. CARVER, YOU'RE NOT
BREAKING UP WITH ME.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.201
( chuckles )

33:22.233 --> 33:23.669
I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU

33:23.701 --> 33:25.471
THE KIND OF ATTENTION
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW,

33:25.503 --> 33:26.672
WITH EVERYTHING
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH--

33:26.704 --> 33:28.140
WITH THE DIVORCE,
AND--

33:28.173 --> 33:29.540
WELL,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.242
AFTER LAST NIGHT.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.680
LAST NIGHT?

33:34.712 --> 33:37.682
BEN SLEPT OVER.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.286
OH.

33:41.319 --> 33:45.223
I GUESS THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
WITH THE WOMAN HE WAS SEEING.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.392
( chuckles )

33:48.126 --> 33:50.229
THAT'S TOO BAD FOR HIM.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.364
YEAH, BUT IT'S GREAT
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

33:52.397 --> 33:54.599
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE

33:54.633 --> 33:57.568
FINALLY HE'S APPRECIATING
WHAT HE HAD, RIGHT?

33:57.603 --> 34:00.138
I MEAN,
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.374

THOMAS CARVER.
ANY RELATION?

34:22.094 --> 34:23.494
MY DAD.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.197
HE WAS A WRITER.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.266

KIERKEGAARD,

34:28.300 --> 34:29.735

34:29.768 --> 34:31.103
WHY ARE YOU
GIVING THIS TO ME?

FEEL FREE TO READ THAT.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.336

I'M NOT USUALLY THAT SENSITIVE.

to live with cancer.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.731
Oh, God,
if that sounds depressing,

36:40.766 --> 36:44.268
let me just tell you
that you never truly live

36:44.302 --> 36:47.539
until you know
you're gonna die.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.898
UM, EXCUSE ME?

37:12.931 --> 37:14.432
WHY IS GERALD'S
BOOTH CLOSED?

37:14.465 --> 37:15.900
OH, IT'S SO SAD.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.668
HE PASSED AWAY
LATE LAST NIGHT.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.905
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS SICK-- CANCER.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.442
I GUESS HE HAD
A TUMOR AROUND HIS HEART

37:23.474 --> 37:26.311
AND IT GREW FAST
AND UNEXPECTEDLY.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.713
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.

37:27.746 --> 37:28.914
HIS POOR WIFE--

37:28.947 --> 37:31.750

WHAT HAPPENED?

37:39.858 --> 37:41.360
I'M SORRY.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.494
I SHOULD HAVE
CALLED FIRST.

37:43.527 --> 37:44.563
NO NO NO.
COME IN.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.500
A FRIEND DIED TODAY.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.836
OH, APRIL.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.572
I MEAN, IT WAS
JUST THIS GUY I MET

37:53.605 --> 37:56.375
WRITING A PIECE.

37:56.407 --> 37:57.509
( sighs )

37:57.541 --> 37:59.043
I HAD JUST STARTED
GETTING TO KNOW HIM,

37:59.277 --> 38:00.978
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU MEET SOMEONE

38:01.012 --> 38:02.847
AND YOU JUST
CONNECT WITH THEM

38:02.880 --> 38:04.650
ON LIKE--

38:05.550 --> 38:07.052
IT'S LIKE THEY GET YOU

38:07.284 --> 38:08.987
ON LIKE
ANOTHER LEVEL.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.521
( sniffles )

38:10.554 --> 38:11.690
I HAD THAT WITH HIM.

38:14.059 --> 38:18.563
HE WAS
A REALLY GOOD MAN.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.431
WHY HIM?

38:22.900 --> 38:25.403
HE WANTED
TO HELP PEOPLE.

38:25.436 --> 38:27.438
WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?

38:31.909 --> 38:33.679
YOU CAN'T TRY TO MAKE
SENSE OF THESE THINGS.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.414
HE HAD A FAMILY

38:35.447 --> 38:38.884
AND A JOB
HE CARED ABOUT SO MUCH.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.588
HE DIDN'T DESERVE THIS.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.458
IT'S NOT FAIR.

38:48.592 --> 38:49.927
( sighs )

38:54.465 --> 38:55.567
I KNOW.

38:55.599 --> 38:57.902
HEY...

38:57.936 --> 38:59.938
IT'S NOT FAIR
YOU LOST YOUR DAD.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.873
SOMETIMES THE BEST PEOPLE
JUST AREN'T THE ONES

39:02.907 --> 39:04.443
THAT GET TO STICK AROUND.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.447
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
THEY'RE NOT THE BEST PEOPLE.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.952
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:13.985 --> 39:17.789
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

39:17.822 --> 39:18.956
IT'S OKAY.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.445
( sighs )

39:41.480 --> 39:42.914
HEY.

39:42.947 --> 39:44.815
HI.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.454
MMM.

39:50.489 --> 39:51.989
SO, LAST NIGHT...

39:52.958 --> 39:54.925
- ( sighs )
- IT WAS GREAT.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.494
YEAH.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.065
NOW GET OUT.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.666
- WHAT?!
- I HAVE ANOTHER GIRL
COMING OVER.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.969
CAN YOU HURRY UP
AND LEAVE SO I CAN
MAKE THE BED?

40:05.503 --> 40:06.670
OH MY GOD.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.472
- SORRY, I HAD TO.
- ( chuckles )

40:08.507 --> 40:10.108
I TOTALLY
DESERVE IT, HUH?

40:12.978 --> 40:14.478
I FEEL LIKE
SUCH AN IDIOT.

40:14.512 --> 40:15.947
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
ACTING SO WEIRD

40:15.981 --> 40:17.815
THESE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.018
THAT WAS SOME SERIOUS
CRAZY-GIRL BEHAVIOR.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.954
IT'S SO NOT LIKE ME.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.856
I'M TAKING IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

40:25.856 --> 40:26.958
YOU SHOULD.

40:26.992 --> 40:30.094
MUST MEAN I REALLY
LIKE YOU OR SOMETHING.

40:31.996 --> 40:33.965
NOW LET'S JUST KEEP BEING
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.867
OKAY?

40:38.003 --> 40:39.838
'CAUSE IF YOU'D
JUST TOLD ME

40:39.871 --> 40:42.940
THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS
OF THOSE OTHER GIRLS

40:42.974 --> 40:45.510
OR YOU WERE WORRIED
THAT I SAW THIS AS CASUAL,

40:45.543 --> 40:46.978
OR SOMETHING,

40:47.012 --> 40:48.880
I WOULD HAVE SAID
"YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT."

40:50.548 --> 40:52.016
IT ALL FEELS REALLY
DIFFERENT WITH YOU.

40:53.885 --> 40:54.885
IT DOES.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.521
YEAH.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.856
( sighs )

40:58.889 --> 41:00.992
YOU'RE LIKE THE FIRST
PERSON I'VE EVER DATED

41:01.025 --> 41:03.628
THAT I CAN ACTUALLY
SEE A FUTURE WITH.

41:18.210 --> 41:19.210
- APRIL?
- ON DEADLINE.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.612
FOR THE BLOG?

41:20.644 --> 41:21.980
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO
HEAR SOME REAL NEWS.

41:22.012 --> 41:25.016
GOVERNOR VONN'S STAFF ARE
APPLYING FOR OTHER JOBS.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.150
WAIT,
VONN'S STEPPING DOWN?

41:26.184 --> 41:27.885
LOOKS THAT WAY,
WHICH MEANS HENDRIE

41:27.918 --> 41:29.588
HAS AN ACTUAL SHOT
AT THE ELECTION.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.889
UH, I'LL GET INTO IT
AFTER THIS.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.557
HAVE THIS PROOFED
BY 5:00.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.659
UH, HEY, PAUL?

41:35.693 --> 41:37.027
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES
FOR MY ARTICLE.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.829
WHAT ARTICLE?
I THOUGHT YOUR GUY DIED.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.164
WHAT?
CARROT DUDE DIED?

41:40.197 --> 41:42.900
JUST LET ME EMAIL IT TO YOU.
THERE'S STILL A STORY HERE.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.168
I GOT
YOUR HEADLINE, APRIL--

41:44.202 --> 41:46.070
"CARROT DUDE: SHREDDED."

41:46.103 --> 41:48.039
CAN YOU NOT BE A JACKASS
FOR ONE SECOND, DANNY?

41:48.072 --> 41:50.041
WHOA, SORRY.

41:50.074 --> 41:52.077
IS YOUR MOM
A CARROT OR SOMETHING?

41:56.081 --> 41:57.983
April:
"IN THE END IT DOESN'T MATTER

41:58.016 --> 42:01.052
THAT GERALD'S CARROT JUICE
COULDN'T SAVE HIM OR THE WORLD.

42:01.085 --> 42:03.655
THE LEGACY OF 'THE CARROT DUDE'
WAS NEVER ABOUT

42:03.688 --> 42:06.056
WHETHER OR NOT
HE COULD CURE CANCER.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.726
IT WAS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY
HE CREATED WITH OTHER PEOPLE

42:08.760 --> 42:10.594
WHO WERE STRUGGLING.

42:10.628 --> 42:12.797
WITH HIS SUPPORT,
HE HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE

42:12.831 --> 42:14.599
FEEL A LITTLE LESS ALONE--

42:14.632 --> 42:17.202
RITA WITH BREAST CANCER,

42:17.235 --> 42:18.737
DENNIS WITH MELANOMA,

42:18.769 --> 42:21.139
LEWIS WITH LYMPHOMA...
