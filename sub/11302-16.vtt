all this free beer?

Mornin', Daddy.

Don't tell me you guys are just
getting in from drinking.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.005
[Colt chuckles]

00:31.088 --> 00:34.338
No, we got up early
so we could feed the cows,

00:34.422 --> 00:36.755
so we could focus on
inseminating the herd.

00:36.838 --> 00:38.630
'Cause we are responsible adults.

00:38.713 --> 00:41.338

Now, bring on the bull jizz.

Yep. [Smacks lips]

- Got the ice off the tanks?
- [Rooster] Yes, sir.

00:49.588 --> 00:50.797
Check the pipe and the pump?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.963
Yep. Even put the morning paper
in the order you like it.

00:54.047 --> 00:56.172
Sports, weather, politics.

00:56.255 --> 00:58.047

about nobody else's. [Chuckles]

01:01.713 --> 01:03.797
All right, we're headed out to the barn.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.088
Looks like there's nothing for you
to yell at us about.

01:06.172 --> 01:08.213
Sorry to rob you of your one true joy.

from getting pregnant.

02:38.672 --> 02:41.088
Yeah. You're good at it, too...

02:41.172 --> 02:42.672

You know, this is a big deal.

02:46.505 --> 02:49.630
If we do a good job with these cows,
Dad'll give us a shit ton more to do.

02:49.713 --> 02:51.588

Prove to Dad we know what we're doing...

02:56.922 --> 02:59.713
maybe he'll let us buy more land,
you know, expand the herd.

02:59.797 --> 03:01.463
Hell, we could even branch out,

03:01.547 --> 03:03.422
you know, open up a dude ranch.

03:03.505 --> 03:06.005
Where the only rule is... no dudes.

03:08.005 --> 03:09.963
Hey, how many we gotta get pregnant?

03:10.047 --> 03:12.088
Well, the whole process
takes about three months.

03:12.172 --> 03:15.172
So... if we get a third each time,
we got a herd.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.880
Hey, what if we get 'em all
pregnant the first time?

03:17.963 --> 03:21.797
Yeah, what if we found out old Mable
shot Coors Light out of her udder?

03:22.547 --> 03:25.130
Yeah. But what if we did?

03:25.213 --> 03:29.088
Man, Dad would come down here
and shower us with hugs and love,

what a good job we did.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.838
Actually, can't go to the bar tonight.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.713

04:04.505 --> 04:05.963
Hey, you know what you should do?

04:06.047 --> 04:07.380
You should get one of those
tuxedo condoms,

04:07.463 --> 04:11.088
put it on your junk, take a picture
and send it to her, and say,

04:11.172 --> 04:12.892
"I'm all dressed up
and ready for our date."

04:13.797 --> 04:15.380

about how you never get laid?

04:15.463 --> 04:17.297
Shit like that's the reason why.

Pinocchio's nose.

11:42.338 --> 11:44.255
[bellows]

11:44.338 --> 11:46.713
Oh, like you wouldn't eat us
if you had the chance.

11:48.088 --> 11:49.088
[Mable bellows]

11:52.047 --> 11:53.755
All right. What the hell is Dale doing?

11:54.838 --> 11:56.797
How long does it take to see
if a cow is pregnant?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.088
The test don't take a long time.

12:00.005 --> 12:03.547
It's waiting for 'em to stop crying
and come out of the bathroom.

12:05.422 --> 12:08.213
If Dale takes as long at his job
as you two take at yours,

12:08.297 --> 12:09.922
he's gonna be in there a while.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.755
Hey, that's hurtful, Daddy.

12:11.838 --> 12:13.380
Thought we were just three guys talking.

12:13.463 --> 12:15.088
[cell phone ringing]

12:15.172 --> 12:17.047
Oh. It's Abby.

12:18.463 --> 12:19.463
Hey, Ab...

12:20.297 --> 12:22.463
Hey, Dad, what's the most amount
of cows you got pregnant?

12:22.547 --> 12:24.672
Out of ten? Nine.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.255
How many we gotta get to,
uh, make you happy?

12:28.338 --> 12:29.380
Nine.

12:30.797 --> 12:32.755
How many we gotta get
to keep you from hating us?

12:32.838 --> 12:34.005
Nine.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.297
[sighs]

12:36.380 --> 12:38.047
You know how it is.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.505
This isn't an exact science.

12:40.588 --> 12:43.630
Hey, what did Abby say?
She leaving you for me?

12:43.713 --> 12:45.338
Her mom got in a car accident.

12:46.255 --> 12:48.172
Oh, shit. I'm an asshole. Is she okay?

12:48.255 --> 12:50.213
Yeah, she a little banged up and bruised.

12:50.297 --> 12:53.297
Got her down at the hospital,
gonna give her some X-rays.

12:53.380 --> 12:54.672
Abby says she should be okay.

12:54.755 --> 12:57.005
All right, good. You know what hit her?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.797
'Cause my friend, Roger,
got hit by a UPS truck.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.463
"What can Brown do for you?"
About $10K a month for 20 years.

13:06.213 --> 13:08.505
She said I don't have to come down.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.838
I think I'm gonna go to the
hospital after we finish up here.

13:10.922 --> 13:13.172
- Is Dale still not done?
- [Dale] I'm all finished.

13:13.255 --> 13:15.838
You heard that from way over there?

13:15.922 --> 13:19.380
Got a new hearing aid.
I hear everything Charlene tells me now.

13:19.463 --> 13:23.255
Apparently, I'm "emotionally distant."

13:24.630 --> 13:26.338
How many cows are pregnant?

13:26.422 --> 13:28.088
- One of 'em.
- One?

13:28.172 --> 13:30.172
- What?
- Shit.

13:30.255 --> 13:32.047
Don't worry, boys. It...

13:32.130 --> 13:33.672
These things happen.

13:33.755 --> 13:35.338
Never happened on my watch.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.547
Oh, come on, Beau. Back in '82,

13:37.630 --> 13:41.005
the only thing you got
pregnant was Maggie.

13:42.338 --> 13:43.880
Great job.

13:45.255 --> 13:47.255
Come on, Dad. Even you said
it's not an exact science.

13:47.338 --> 13:49.505
Yeah, next time we'll get four or five!

13:49.588 --> 13:53.047
As far as I can see, you boys did
the best you could possibly do,

13:53.130 --> 13:55.547
short of mounting
those heifers yourselves.

13:57.463 --> 13:58.797
You didn't do that, did you?

14:01.255 --> 14:04.630
All right, I'm gonna go down
to the hospital and check on Abby.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.713
Thank you, Dale.

14:07.713 --> 14:08.713
[door opening]

14:10.130 --> 14:11.130
[door closes]

14:12.047 --> 14:13.547
This thing's incredible.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.880
I can hear your dad
talking down in the barn.

14:16.963 --> 14:18.963
- What's he saying?
- Whoa!

14:20.172 --> 14:24.255
He... he says he loves you
and you did the best you could.

14:25.213 --> 14:26.213
I've gotta go.

14:32.922 --> 14:33.922
[indistinct chatter]

14:38.130 --> 14:39.630
[elevator bell dings]

14:43.713 --> 14:45.213
One cow.

14:45.297 --> 14:48.297
One fucking cow out of ten.

14:49.005 --> 14:50.047
Aw...

14:50.130 --> 14:52.755
Wasn't that the lullaby
you used to sing to the boys?

14:55.713 --> 14:58.380
Come on, first try, one cow.
It's not so bad.

14:58.463 --> 15:00.880
So much of it is luck anyway.

15:00.963 --> 15:04.797
How would you feel if they came in here
and paid for one out of ten beers?

15:04.880 --> 15:07.172
[gasps] Oh! I'd be ecstatic.

15:08.922 --> 15:10.922
I'm sure the next batch will go better.

15:11.005 --> 15:14.588
Yeah, it will.
I'm gonna take it back over again.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.088
Beau, you gave them the job,
you have to let them finish it.

15:19.172 --> 15:23.005
I've seen enough to know that
it was a mistake to trust them with this.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.172
Yeah, it took you 35 years
to give them a chance.

15:26.255 --> 15:27.797
Why not give up on 'em right away?

15:27.880 --> 15:32.297
Maggie, they were playing <i>Star Wars</i>
with the sperm gun.

15:34.172 --> 15:36.755
Rooster was waving it around saying...

15:36.838 --> 15:39.630
"Mable, I am your father."

15:39.713 --> 15:40.922
[chuckles]

15:42.047 --> 15:44.422
Okay. Well, that's kind of funny. I...

15:47.130 --> 15:49.963
No. I've been through a lean year,

15:50.047 --> 15:52.047
been through a fire,
been through a drought.

15:53.838 --> 15:58.880
The only thing I can't seem to get through
is my own two sons.

16:00.797 --> 16:01.922
Unbelievable.

16:02.838 --> 16:03.880
What?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.588
Well, you're happy, aren't you?

16:07.088 --> 16:08.213
Oh, yeah, I'm...

16:08.297 --> 16:09.505
I'm feeling great.

16:09.588 --> 16:12.797
Yee-haw! I'm farting rainbows.

16:14.297 --> 16:19.380
No. If those boys were to
knock up the whole damn herd,

16:19.463 --> 16:22.047
that would mean they didn't
need you anymore,

16:22.130 --> 16:23.338
that you were wrong.

16:24.755 --> 16:26.588
Do you think I want them to fail?

16:27.588 --> 16:30.505
Yeah. And I think you want to be
the only one to fix it.

16:32.338 --> 16:36.797
This is too important
to leave to Luke Spermwalker.

16:38.297 --> 16:41.255
Well, breeding season
is three months long.

16:41.338 --> 16:44.422
So, give them the first month,
maybe they'll surprise you.

16:44.505 --> 16:48.130
If not, you still have time
to do it your way.

16:49.755 --> 16:50.880
Fine.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.005
But if they screw it up...

16:54.088 --> 16:55.172
I'm blaming you.

16:55.255 --> 16:58.505
That's the magic of divorce.
You blame me, I don't give a shit.

17:02.797 --> 17:03.838
Colt.

17:04.755 --> 17:06.130
Hey.

17:06.213 --> 17:07.547
How'd it go at the hospital?

17:07.630 --> 17:10.755
Fractured ankle,
couple of bumps and bruises.

17:10.838 --> 17:13.463
Loving being the center of attention.
Milking it for all it's worth.

17:13.547 --> 17:16.005
You know. Mom.

17:17.255 --> 17:19.463
You, uh, there all by yourself?

17:19.547 --> 17:20.797
No.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.797
Dad was there.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.547
Aunt Susan, Uncle Jimmy.

17:25.630 --> 17:29.672
As always, Jimmy asked one of the nurses
if he could get a hernia exam.

17:29.755 --> 17:31.088
[scoffs]

17:31.172 --> 17:34.380
She said "Sure,"
and she calls her colleague in, Frank.

17:34.463 --> 17:36.672
His hernia cleared up real quick.

17:39.005 --> 17:41.922
- Anybody else?
- Security eventually came.

17:42.005 --> 17:45.505
Escorted Jimmy out.
And a couple of friends.

17:45.588 --> 17:47.255
Anybody I know?

17:47.338 --> 17:49.547
Nope, I don't think so.

17:50.922 --> 17:52.838
There is a separate question.

17:52.922 --> 17:55.505
Is your mom sharing a room
with someone Kenny knows?

17:56.755 --> 17:57.838
Oh, my God.

17:57.922 --> 18:00.297
- Yeah, I came down there.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.463
Saw you talking to Kenny.
Saw you hugging Kenny.

18:03.547 --> 18:05.338
I saw my fist go through a wall.

18:05.422 --> 18:08.338
Then I saw a nurse on the third floor,
who gave me an X-ray.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.255
Why wouldn't you just say you knew?

18:13.297 --> 18:14.697
I wanted to see if you'd lie to me.

18:15.588 --> 18:17.047
- And then you did.
- [scoffs]

18:18.005 --> 18:20.755
Oh, my hand's fine by the way,
it's just a bone bruise.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.463
- [rustling]
- This is for your mom.

18:23.547 --> 18:24.588
Okay... [scoffs]

18:24.630 --> 18:26.172
Listen, the only reason why I lied

18:26.255 --> 18:29.088
is 'cause I knew you'd make
a big deal about it for no reason.

18:29.172 --> 18:30.255
How did he even know what happened?

18:30.338 --> 18:31.713
I called him.

18:31.797 --> 18:33.380
- You called him?
- Yeah, I called him.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.880
And I called you, and I called
a bunch of people.

18:36.963 --> 18:38.588
Okay? He's close with my mom.

18:38.672 --> 18:40.588
He'd want to know. It's not a big deal.

18:40.672 --> 18:43.630
Oh, it's not a big deal that the guy
that you dated for five years,

18:43.713 --> 18:44.755
and then were gonna marry,

18:44.838 --> 18:46.713
is the guy you depend on
when something goes wrong?

18:46.797 --> 18:48.672
It's not like that.
I didn't ask him to come.

18:48.755 --> 18:50.380
- He just showed up like you did.
- Oh, oh, oh... Okay.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.213
So your dad gets his hand
caught in a wood chipper,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.005
Kenny's just gonna show up
at the hospital?

18:54.088 --> 18:56.963
Not sure that's the worst part
of that scenario.

18:58.213 --> 18:59.838
I don't want you talking to him anymore.

18:59.922 --> 19:01.005
Excuse me?

19:01.088 --> 19:03.505
[stammers] You seriously
just say that to me?

19:03.588 --> 19:05.922
Yeah, I did.
I'm your boyfriend now, not him.

19:06.005 --> 19:07.838
All right. So that's how it's gonna be.

19:07.922 --> 19:09.797
All right, well, I dated Brad
down at the 76.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.005
Come on. This...

19:11.088 --> 19:12.255
You gonna forbid me to pump gas?

19:12.338 --> 19:14.255
Of course not, I think... Wait, Brad?

19:14.338 --> 19:17.130
The guy who sells ferrets? Seriously?

19:17.213 --> 19:18.755
Mmm-hmm.

19:18.838 --> 19:20.838
Look, I'm sorry if this
makes you uncomfortable,

19:20.922 --> 19:24.130
but, I mean, I couldn't avoid Kenny,
even if I wanted to.

19:24.213 --> 19:26.255
Oh! So you admit that you don't want to.

19:26.338 --> 19:29.297
We're in each other's lives.
We have the same friends.

19:29.380 --> 19:32.922
He spent the last five years
of holidays with my family.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.713
My Netflix list is on his account.

19:36.588 --> 19:38.713
Why you got pictures of you and him
all over your house?

19:38.797 --> 19:40.838
Uh, 'cause we broke up a week ago

19:40.922 --> 19:43.630
and I haven't had time
to get rid of every memory of him.

19:43.713 --> 19:46.713
[scoffs] This is not a high school movie,

19:46.797 --> 19:49.422
where I'm gonna cut his face
out of every picture

19:49.505 --> 19:50.838
and burn all the letters.

19:50.922 --> 19:53.130
My dad burned all my mom's shit, so...

19:54.588 --> 19:56.130
Colt, those pictures are memories.

19:57.088 --> 19:59.963
They're a part of my life...
like Kenny is.

20:01.005 --> 20:02.130
My God.

20:02.213 --> 20:03.880
All we do is fucking fight.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.172
[Abby scoffs]

20:07.255 --> 20:11.380
I just want to be the person you call
when something goes wrong.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.463
Colt, you are.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.005
You're the only one
that I want to be with.

20:19.088 --> 20:20.713
How can I make you see that?

20:25.630 --> 20:27.797
Tell me I'm an asshole,
and then come over here

20:27.880 --> 20:30.547
and make out with me so hard
that I'll learn my lesson.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.422
[both chuckling]

20:32.505 --> 20:34.088
[softly] Come here. I...

20:35.672 --> 20:37.963
I'm sorry that I made you question that.

20:39.922 --> 20:43.630
And... I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Kenny being there.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.380
Okay?

20:48.755 --> 20:50.172
- [softly] Yeah.
- Okay.

20:51.672 --> 20:53.380
- [Colt grunts]
- [chuckles]

20:56.797 --> 21:00.630
- I'm sorry that I tried to trap you.
- [chuckles]

21:00.713 --> 21:04.505
[chuckles] And that I doubted...
your feelings for me.

21:07.088 --> 21:11.505
I'm also sorry that I kicked the head
off your Denver Broncos garden gnome.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.505
I don't have a garden gnome.
That's Mrs. Williger's next door.

21:17.005 --> 21:19.588
- Oh.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

21:19.672 --> 21:22.922
Does she also have a bird bath
that I'm sorry I peed in?

21:23.005 --> 21:24.380
[both chuckle]

21:31.630 --> 21:33.588
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.910
Hey, how's everything with Abby?

21:36.838 --> 21:39.380
Well... [sighs] we got in a big fight.

21:40.672 --> 21:42.755
'Cause she lied to me about
Kenny being at the hospital,

21:42.838 --> 21:45.630
and then, of course, she gets mad at me
for trapping her into a lie.

21:45.713 --> 21:48.130
But... we managed to work everything out.

21:48.213 --> 21:51.463
Bottom line is she trusts me,
and I trust her, and everything's fine.

21:51.547 --> 21:54.380
Yeah, cool. I meant "Is her mom dead?"
But we can talk about you.

21:55.963 --> 21:57.505
What's going on?

21:57.588 --> 21:59.838
Just got here.
Telling Mom what an asshole Dad's being.

21:59.922 --> 22:02.880
Yeah, I was telling Rooster
how the sky is blue.

22:03.922 --> 22:05.088
Hey, Mom, can I get a beer?

22:06.588 --> 22:08.338
We get the "Mean Dad" discount, right?

22:10.463 --> 22:13.213
If that's a thing,
I'm owed a massive refund.

22:15.005 --> 22:17.672
Hey, your dad was in earlier today.
I calmed him down,

22:17.755 --> 22:19.630
so I think you'll get
another shot at the herd.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.172
- Serious?
- Yeah.

22:23.255 --> 22:26.005
Just don't do anything to annoy him, like,

22:26.088 --> 22:29.963
no goofing around, no cracking jokes,
and no smiling.

22:31.213 --> 22:33.088
So, act like him.

22:33.172 --> 22:34.588
Exactly.

22:34.713 --> 22:39.047
Just saying, it would help if you could
just die a little inside.

22:39.130 --> 22:40.255
[both chuckling]

22:41.547 --> 22:43.255
All right, well, thanks, Mom.

22:43.338 --> 22:44.838
- We got a big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

22:44.922 --> 22:46.442
I don't think I'm gonna drink tonight.

22:47.213 --> 22:48.797
Yeah, you know, me neither.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.130
Oh, good for you, boys.

22:50.213 --> 22:52.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Beer's not drinking.

22:57.047 --> 22:59.630
Oh, check it out.
There's your best friend, Kenny.

22:59.713 --> 23:00.797
Yeah.

23:02.505 --> 23:04.547
All right, I should probably
go talk to him.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.422
Why? He got a new girlfriend
you wanna steal?

23:07.713 --> 23:09.338
Just feel bad.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.880
Plus, Abby'd be happy
if we all got along.

23:12.797 --> 23:15.338
Bottom line is,
it's the grown up thing to do, right?

23:15.422 --> 23:18.630
I agree. So maybe grown-ups
should go talk to him.

23:18.713 --> 23:20.255
Yeah, that's very funny.

23:20.338 --> 23:23.255
[loudly] Now, Rooster, you can live
a totally normal life with herpes.

23:24.963 --> 23:26.672
Like that's news to anybody in this bar.

23:29.047 --> 23:31.255
Hey, Kenny. You got a second?

23:31.338 --> 23:35.213
Well, I don't have a fiancée
waiting for me at home. So, why not?

23:37.047 --> 23:39.297
Yeah. Um...

23:39.380 --> 23:42.213
look, I know you and Abby are friends,

23:42.297 --> 23:44.172
and I know you're gonna see each other,

23:44.255 --> 23:46.130
so... I just...

23:46.213 --> 23:49.547
I don't want it to be weird if we
run into each other here or...

23:50.672 --> 23:52.963
somebody else opens up
a bar in this town, there.

23:53.047 --> 23:54.672
I just...

23:55.713 --> 23:59.172
I just want you to know that
I'm cool with everything.

23:59.255 --> 24:00.630
You shouldn't be.

24:00.713 --> 24:01.880
What?

24:01.963 --> 24:03.797
Abby and I should be together.

24:05.088 --> 24:08.672
So... are you gonna try to
steal her from me?

24:08.755 --> 24:10.172
No.

24:11.213 --> 24:12.422
I'm not gonna be like you.

24:12.505 --> 24:15.505
I'm not gonna be the asshole
who steals the girl.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.838
I'm the good guy...

24:18.088 --> 24:21.255
who the girl comes back to
after the fling with the asshole.

24:22.630 --> 24:25.463
And if you were thinking we were gonna
hang out, I... [scoffs] I gotta pass.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.380
Abby's dad and I
are going skiing tomorrow.

24:28.463 --> 24:29.922
Yeah, he calls me "son."

24:31.213 --> 24:32.755
What's he call you?

24:32.838 --> 24:34.463
[chuckles] Oh, that's right...

24:34.547 --> 24:35.713
"dipshit."

24:35.797 --> 24:37.130
That's it, yeah.

24:38.505 --> 24:39.713
Good to see you, man.

24:41.005 --> 24:42.755
"Dipshit"? Oh, you know what?

24:42.838 --> 24:45.505
I ain't cool with you hanging out
with Abby anymore.

24:45.588 --> 24:47.505
[stammers] Please don't
tell her I said that.

24:53.338 --> 24:54.672
[yawns]

24:55.880 --> 24:58.213
How many cows we got lined up for today?

24:58.297 --> 25:00.755
Uh... three so far,

25:00.838 --> 25:03.713
and hopefully some more this afternoon.

25:03.797 --> 25:06.797
Oh, hey. You're a NASCAR driver.
Who's your sponsor?

25:06.880 --> 25:09.130
[chuckles] That's easy.

25:09.213 --> 25:10.963
Two things I can't live without...

25:11.047 --> 25:13.005
Trojan condoms and Cocoa Puffs.

25:13.088 --> 25:15.755
[laughs] Come on, man,
you don't wear condoms.

25:15.838 --> 25:16.963
Yeah, but they don't know that.

25:17.047 --> 25:19.213
- [scoffs] Oh-ho.
- Who's yours?

25:19.297 --> 25:20.630
Oh, man, that's easy.

25:20.713 --> 25:22.963
I'm putting Chuck Norris
on the hood of my car.

25:23.963 --> 25:25.130
Chuck don't sponsor cars.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.588
Yeah, whatever.

25:26.672 --> 25:29.297
Look in your rearview mirror,
you see Walker bearing down on you,

25:29.380 --> 25:30.630
you get the fuck out the way.

25:30.713 --> 25:32.255
Mmm-hmm.

25:32.338 --> 25:34.963
- I was thinking about Kate Upton...
- Lambert. Lambert.

25:35.047 --> 25:36.088
No, Kate Up...

25:36.172 --> 25:38.297
- Hey. What're you doing?
- Dad?

25:38.380 --> 25:42.005
Inseminating the herd. Cows are all set.

25:43.005 --> 25:44.672
What? You started without us?

25:44.755 --> 25:46.922
Yep. I finished without you, too.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.172
You said this is ours.
You gave it to us.

25:51.213 --> 25:52.463
Now I'm taking it back.

25:52.547 --> 25:54.422
What do you mean you're taking it back?

25:55.547 --> 25:58.047
'Cause we had bad luck with the first ten?

25:58.130 --> 25:59.713
What? It ain't even been a week.

25:59.797 --> 26:02.172
That's long enough for me to know
you're not ready.

26:03.255 --> 26:05.005
You didn't even give us a chance.

26:06.088 --> 26:07.968
- You... Mom said that you were gonna...
- Stop.

26:09.005 --> 26:10.005
It's done.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.588
Maybe you can try again next year.

26:15.213 --> 26:17.880
Turn the cow out, put that stuff away.

26:17.963 --> 26:19.463
[clattering]

26:27.797 --> 26:28.922
Fuck!
