00:04.160 --> 00:05.991
Gum is one of the weirdest
human inventions.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.435
It's not a liquid. It's not a solid.
It's not a food.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.394
What is it?
It isn't really anything.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.758
You know, I mean, it's like
a stationary bike for your jaw.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.798
Remember when you were in school
and teachers would get riled up...

00:18.960 --> 00:20.313
...if they caught you with gum?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.675
When you're a kid,
you think what's the big deal?

00:22.840 --> 00:24.319
As an adult, I can understand it...

00:24.480 --> 00:28.155
...because when you're chewing gum,
you don't look thrilled with anything.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.709
World War ll, that was
an important historical event?

00:30.880 --> 00:32.279
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.316
They landed a man
on the moon in 1969?

00:39.480 --> 00:41.118
Yeah, right.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.396
Yeah, I buy that, teach.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.036
Do you think she's happy?

00:52.560 --> 00:54.073
-Who?
-The cashier.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.510
-Ruthie Cohen?
-You know her name?

00:57.680 --> 00:58.669
Sure.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.798
-I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
-Maybe that's why she's happy.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.796
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-What is this?

01:06.960 --> 01:11.078
Well, it's the latest offering
from the Alex Theatre.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.392
-That stinky old movie house?
-Well, you should smell it now.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.154
-We fixed up the place.
-With Spartacus?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.073
Well, it's a rare archival print.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.348
Twelve extra minutes,
full wide-screen Cinemascope.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.593
And if you come to the 1;00 show,
you can hear Jeffrey Haarwood.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.189
-Jeffrey who?
-Haarwood.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.273
He was the assistant
wardrobe man on Spartacus.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.954
He has some fascinating insights
into the production.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.710
Why would you spend $7 to see
a movie that I could watch on TV?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.438
Well, why go to a fine restaurant...

01:44.600 --> 01:46.875
...when you can just stick something
in the microwave?

01:47.040 --> 01:51.989
Why go to the park and fly a kite
when you can just pop a pill?

01:52.800 --> 01:55.758
You guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun,
have you? I'm supposed to meet him.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.399
Lloyd Braun? What for?

01:57.560 --> 01:59.994
Well, he's using his connections
in the mayor's office...

02:00.160 --> 02:02.310
...to get the theatre landmark status.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.471
I thought he screwed up
the Dinkins campaign.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.996
Well, he did. After that,
he had a nervous breakdown.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.720
Had to spend a few months
in an institution.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.992
-Really?
-Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.674
-I've taken him under my wing.
-Oh, then I'm not worried.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.671
But he still needs all of our support.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.514
When he gets here,
treat him like he's one of the gang.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.874
Breakdown, huh?

02:23.040 --> 02:25.110
-Hey, Kramer.
-Hey, Lloyd. Hey, buddy.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.077
-How you doing? Hi, Jerry.
-Lloyd.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.595
-George.
-Hello, Lloyd.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.275
-How you doing?
-Well, he's doing fine, George.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.796
-Gum.
-That's an interesting package.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.518
Yeah, it's from China.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.908
Go ahead, try a piece.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.878
Tell me that's not the most
delicious gum you've ever tasted.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.795
Yes, yes, we shall all try a piece
and tell you how delicious it is.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.589
-George.
-I don't chew gum.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.912
It's different. Where did you get it?

02:52.080 --> 02:54.036
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave it to me.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.555
-I can ask him where he got it.
-No, don't bother.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.199
-It's no problem.
-I don't want it.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.316
Jerry, Lloyd says it's no problem.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.597
He's capable of locating the gum.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.716
-All right.
-Boy, this is-- This is delicious.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.158
You know what? I think this Ruthie
Cohen gave me the wrong change.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.834
Didn't I pay with a 20?
I'm sure I paid with a 20.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.989
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.879
I think I finally figured out
what the flavour is in this gum.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.190
It's a little lo meiny.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.997
-What kind is that?
-It's Chinese gum.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.675
-Lloyd Braun gave it to me.
-Lloyd Braun. How's he doing?

03:33.840 --> 03:36.957
After Dinkins lost the election,
he had a complete nervous breakdown.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.872
They had to lock him up.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.156
That's around the same time
I broke up with Lloyd.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.278
You don't think that I had anything
to do with his breakdown, do you?

03:44.440 --> 03:47.830
I remember, when we parted company,
I was babbling incoherently for months.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.752
Yeah, well, I've got news for you.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.593
While I was growing up
all I heard from my mother was;

03:52.760 --> 03:55.149
"Why can't you be more
like that Lloyd Braun?"

03:55.320 --> 03:57.914
And in the end, Lloyd Braun
became more like you.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.994
-Right, gotta get going.
-Aren't you coming to Spartacus?

04:01.160 --> 04:03.196
I gotta deliver Christmas
presents to my parents.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.830
-I thought they were out of town.
-Why do you think I'm going now?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.595
-Georgie.
-Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.239
Back in the old neighbourhood, huh?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.675
Yeah, yeah, just delivering
some presents to my folks.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.956
Oh, snazzy car.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.914
-LeBaron?
-Yeah, '83.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.672
It used to belong to Jon Voight.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.559
-The actor, right?
-Something like that.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.950
-Mind if I look under the hood?
-No, go ahead, Pop.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.680
-You always knew your cars.
-Yeah.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.956
Oh, Deena, Deena.
Deena, look who's here.

04:34.120 --> 04:38.079
-George Costanza, is that you?
-Hey, Deena. Come on, give us a hug.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.959
Oh, my gosh, you look as pretty
as you did back in high school.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.190
Boy, those were some crazy times.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.638
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy,
did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

04:49.440 --> 04:53.592
The Alex was built in 1922, during
the golden age of movie palaces.

04:53.760 --> 05:00.313
Minor restorations in
1941, '47, '52, '58, '63...

05:00.480 --> 05:04.314
...and currently to our present
period of time.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.391
-You're really getting into this?
-I am.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.109
The icing on the cake would be
that landmark status from the city.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.794
We're hoping Lloyd Braun
can pull a few strings.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.393
Oh, can on Lloyd really do that?

05:14.560 --> 05:18.394
Lloyd Braun can do anything
he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.073
You should
say hello to him, Elaine.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.992
What? Lloyd's here?
No, no, I'd rather--

05:22.160 --> 05:26.073
-Hi, Elaine.
-Lloyd. Yes, hello.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.275
Did Kramer tell you?

05:27.440 --> 05:30.159
We reserved some special seats
so we can all sit together.

05:31.880 --> 05:37.273
Oh, well, actually, Lloyd, Jerry and l
have to sit in the front row...

05:37.440 --> 05:40.955
...because--
Because he forgot his glasses.

05:41.120 --> 05:46.035
So thanks for getting us the--
We'll see you afterwards.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.474
Come on.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.071
That was odd.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.113
Am I crazy
or does Jerry not wear glasses?

05:53.280 --> 05:56.317
You're not crazy.
Jerry does wear glasses.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.710
He just forgot them, that's all.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.558
Not crazy.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.997
We're all the way in the front row?
Couldn't we sit in the special seats?

06:07.160 --> 06:10.197
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd
thinking I was leading him on again.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.033
Seeing him made me feel
very uncomfortable.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.560
No, you don't want
to be uncomfortable.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.198
-Poor Lloyd.
-I know. Completely bonkers.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.753
I'm sorry I can't be so flip
about this kind of thing.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.036
You know, after what
happened to Pop.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.038
Pop? What happened to Pop?

06:35.200 --> 06:36.872
I thought you heard.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.712
He had a nervous breakdown
last year.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.393
That's why I'm taking care of him.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.790
I tell you, they don't build them
like this anymore.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.714
He doesn't have
the auto shop anymore?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.791
It was too much for him.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.114
-I gotta go.
-What?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.396
I just remembered
I gotta be someplace.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.676
That's enough, Pop.
Put down the wrench, Pop.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:21.120 --> 07:24.157
Pop! Pop!

07:25.200 --> 07:26.235
-Great movie, huh?
-Yeah.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.517
-Sorry you forgot those glasses.
-I don't know what I was thinking.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.434
-How did you like that gum?
-He loved it.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.239
Kramer, you know,
there isn't a light in the ladies room.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.391
Yeah, it's being repaired.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.874
Oh, God.

07:41.040 --> 07:45.511
-You all right?
-I sat too close to the screen.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.435
I just gotta stretch out
in a hot bath.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.830
It was nice see you again, Lloyd.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.519
Officer. Officer, is there some reason
this man has too be using a hose.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.312
I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.358
It's a waste of water.
Couldn't he just use a broom?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.112
Lady, you sold me.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.599
Hey, you with the hose.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.914
Here, put these glasses on.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.640
-What's this for?
-Lloyd's gonna be here any minute.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.917
-So what?
-Well, he thinks you wear those.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.640
They're from the lost and found
at the Alex.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.109
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna put these on.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.508
Oh, okay.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.717
So he'll just think that the two of you
didn't sit with him on purpose.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.190
Oh, yeah, that's very nice.
Very nice.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.993
Excuse me,
I was in here this morning...

08:43.159 --> 08:45.754
...and I believe I paid you
with a 20-dollar bill...

08:45.920 --> 08:48.878
...but you only gave me
change for a 10.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.270
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I think so.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.668
And I can prove it.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.432
You see, I was doodling
on the bill...

08:54.600 --> 08:58.036
...and so if you have a 20 in there
with big lips on it...

08:58.200 --> 08:59.189
...well, that's mine.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.112
Would you mind
opening up the register?

09:01.280 --> 09:02.633
Not unless you buy something.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.871
Okay. Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.632
Hey, George.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.674
-Thought you didn't chew gum.
-I don't.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.319
Take a look.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.598
I know I gave it to you.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.671
George, you mind?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.197
Fine, fine. Excuse me.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.670
Think I'm gonna forget about this?
I haven't forgotten. I don't forget easily.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.076
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.549
-Oh, Lloyd.
-Hi, Jerry.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.280
-Got some more of that gum.
-Oh, the gum.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.234
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

09:44.720 --> 09:46.472
-All right.
-Oh, boy.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.629
Sit down.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.792
Yeah, now, see, this is what
the holidays are all about.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.599
Three buddies sitting around
chewing gum, huh?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.433
Yeah.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.233
So, you know, Lloyd,
he thinks he can get more of this.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.671
Well, Lloyd
is a very industrious fellow.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.310
I'm sure he can accomplish anything
he sets his mind to.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.751
Actually, the importer
is right in Chinatown.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.115
I'll introduce you.
You can get it get it whenever.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.032
It's not necessary.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.794
Hey, Jerry, you know,
Lloyd wants to do you a favour.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.712
I know that, Kramer.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.791
-lf you don't want to....
-Sure, he wants to.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.396
And it's very kind of you.
Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.109
-Don't you, Jerry?
-Yes, I do, Kramer.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.396
-So how about that Elaine today?
-Oh, baby.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.120
What is that all about, huh?

10:35.280 --> 10:37.919
She was practically undressing
in front of me at the theatre.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.073
-I didn't see anything.
-You really missed a show, buddy.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.392
Yeah.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.271
You're probably wondering
why I wanted to see you again.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.675
Well, you know....

11:01.200 --> 11:02.997
It's understandable.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.433
I'm glad you feel that way.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.909
Because since my father's
breakdown...

11:08.080 --> 11:10.310
...I've become very sensitive
to the warning signs.

11:10.880 --> 11:15.590
-Warning signs?
-Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.432
What?

11:17.800 --> 11:20.598
What are you talking about?
I'm not the one with the problem.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.320
Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse,
not me.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.552
Yeah, and taking pleasure
in the misfortunes of others.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.479
-All my friends do that.
-George, I'm only trying help.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.959
I'm concerned.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.589
George?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.595
-Are you listening to me?
-Do you see that woman?

11:39.520 --> 11:42.353
She stole $20 from me.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.954
I might have gotten it back,
but Lloyd Braun interfered.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.509
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.999
Hey. Hey, you!

11:49.160 --> 11:52.948
Get back here!
Don't gallop away. I'm on to you.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.152
So you're saying
she was on a horse?

11:58.480 --> 12:01.836
I'm telling you, that cashier
is riding horses on my money.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.638
Well, here's what I propose.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.631
Go down to the stables,
snoop around.

12:05.800 --> 12:10.351
See if any high-flying cashier has been
throwing $20 bills around with big lips.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.594
-Hey.
-Well, if it isn't Chesty Larue.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.036
-What?
-I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.555
He was bragging about
the show you gave him at the Alex.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.759
Oh, God. I lost a button,
so my blouse was wide open.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.319
I must've left it at the theatre.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.277
-Maybe it's in the lost and found.
-I know.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.590
I have to go check it out.
It's a beautiful button.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.478
It's antique ivory.
It was my mother's.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.757
You know, the way you were wolfing
down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.392
Mr. Haarwood, what an unexpected
surprise to have you back at the Alex.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.075
Well, I'm in a bit of a quandary.
I've misplaced my spectacles.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.198
Well, let's look in lost and found,
shall we?

12:48.480 --> 12:49.913
They're half glasses.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.910
-Brown?
-Yes, yes.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.992
Yeah, well, if they're not in the box,
I'm sure they'll turn up soon.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.992
Listen, could you keep
an eye on the place?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.798
I wanna go get some paraffin wax...

13:01.960 --> 13:04.918
...and bring out the lustre
of this vintage countertop.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.877
Yes, certainly.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.791
Oh, my goodness.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.712
What a spanking button.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.153
All right, all right.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.240
Hang on. It's warming up.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.035
Hey, what is your problem?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.393
Oh, hello. It's you.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.994
Listen, lady, I've got
six minutes left on that meter...

13:43.160 --> 13:46.072
...and I'm not budging until
you admit you stole my $20.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.072
You're not so stuff tough when you're
not on your horse, are you, Ruthie?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.753
Your car's on fire.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.999
Merry Christmas.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.752
Fire!

13:59.600 --> 14:02.717
-Your hose! Where's your hose?
-The cop made me disconnect it.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.432
What happened to your car, buddy?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.790
The Jon Voight car is no more.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.237
Well, don't you sweat it. You can
use my car anytime you want to.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.910
-No kidding?
-No kidding.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.310
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.039
-Yeah, merry Christmas.
-Whatever.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.633
-All right. I'm here. Where's Braun?
-What? He's not here yet?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.519
Look. I'll go downtown to Chinatown
with him, but that is it.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.398
-I need those glasses.
-Why?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.755
They're Jeffrey Haarwood's.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.595
Here, try this pair.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.675
Wow, these are really....

14:56.640 --> 14:59.473
Hey, gum-buddy. Nice frames.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.200
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, yeah.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.316
Yeah, he's all ready to go.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.517
-Anybody see Elaine today?
-Oh, yeah, she called a little earlier.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.513
She's coming over
to check out lost and found.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.554
Maybe I'll stick around
and see what she's wearing today.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.472
Or not wearing,
if you know what I mean.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.551
Absolutely, let's just stick around.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.517
I'll tell you what,
they're expecting us.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.114
-Let me just grab a hot dog here.
-Oh, yeah.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.989
I'd like a hot dog, please.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.519
Are you out of your mind?

15:29.440 --> 15:31.112
What's the problem here?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.748
This hot dog's been here
since the silent era.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.832
-You'd have to be insane to eat it.
-No, no, this man is not insane.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.558
There's nothing wrong
with it or you.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.233
-Kramer--
-No, no, I'll show you.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.598
-One hot dog, please.
-Okay.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.435
Doesn't that smell good, huh?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.591
Here we go. Yeah.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.669
Oh, that's delicious.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.593
This is a perfectly sane food to eat.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.035
Interesting texture.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.077
It's chewy.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.909
I gotta get some air.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.438
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.716
Weren't you told
to stop using that hose?

16:29.200 --> 16:32.954
-How would you happen to know that?
-Well....

16:33.120 --> 16:36.157
You're that lady that was
talking to the cops, aren't you?

16:38.600 --> 16:42.832
-Hey, Joe!
-Oh, wait, wait! Stop it!

16:44.480 --> 16:47.677
-Hey, everybody.
-Whoa, Elaine!

16:49.080 --> 16:51.833
Once again you've managed
to top yourself.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.599
Come on, Jerry, let's go.
The car is out front.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.031
Lloyd.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.554
Lloyd.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.915
What is Lloyd's problem?

17:15.079 --> 17:17.913
Look, honey, I know you're trying
to get Lloyd to notice you...

17:18.079 --> 17:19.512
...but this is too much.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.348
Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.112
I got sprayed with a hose.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.874
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but the Alex is a family theatre...

17:29.040 --> 17:30.837
...not one of your swing joints.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.592
So you want my father
to pay for this?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.910
Well, you saw him.
He was fiddling with the engine.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.513
God knows what he did there.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.399
And I suppose Lloyd Braun
had something to do with it too?

17:46.560 --> 17:49.711
-Not Lloyd Braun, but the cashier.
-What cashier?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.917
You remember the woman
on the horse? She wanted my spot.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.114
-To park her horse?
-No, she wasn't on the horse.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.074
So your car caught fire...

17:58.240 --> 18:01.232
...because of my father
and the woman on the horse.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.233
That's right. And him.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.715
-The man with the flowers?
-Yeah, yeah, the flower guy.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.792
Listen, I know this all sounds
a little crazy, but--

18:10.960 --> 18:12.712
I can't believe it.
That's Jerry Seinfeld.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.518
-Who?
-Jerry Seinfeld, my best friend.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.796
He can explain all of this.
Jerry, Jerry!

18:16.960 --> 18:19.190
Over here, Jerry. It's me!

18:19.360 --> 18:22.079
Where are you going?
It's-- What are you--?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.479
-That was your best friend?
-Yeah.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.791
-But he doesn't wear glasses.
-That man was wearing glasses.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.793
Don't you see? He was doing it
to fool Lloyd Braun.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.759
I'll run in and get the gum.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.911
-All right.
-Got any money?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.271
Here.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.432
I'll be back.

18:54.880 --> 18:58.270
Look, Deena, I know you think
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.113
This is just a series
of bad coincidences.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.430
I don't know, George.
I don't know what to believe.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.436
Believe me, I am not crazy.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.673
Well, I guess it's possible.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.917
Here you go.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.672
-All this?
-Yeah.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.718
-A hundred dollars worth.
-I gave you a hundred dollars?

19:22.880 --> 19:24.108
You sure did.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.955
-Am I crazy or is that a lot of gum?
-It's a lot of gum!

19:30.240 --> 19:32.276
Mr. Haarwood, I found your glasses.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.919
Oh, splendid.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.469
Welcome to the
lnstitute for the Preservation...

19:36.640 --> 19:39.598
...of Motion Picture Costumes
and Wardrobes.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.990
The l.P.M.P.C.W.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.910
We prefer to call it the lnstitute.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.196
-ls that from Henry VIII?
-Yes, yes, it is.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.033
Yeah, well, you know, we're
screening that tonight at the Alex.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.634
You think that I could wear
that to promote the theatre?

19:52.800 --> 19:55.792
Well, I'd love to lend it to you,
but I doubt if it would fit a man...

19:55.960 --> 19:59.430
...of your impressive
Raymond Massey-like physique.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.672
The only person who could
really fit into this costume...

20:02.840 --> 20:07.197
...would have to be a short, stocky man
of somewhat generous proportion.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.276
You don't say.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.276
You're really helping
me out with this, buddy.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.512
-Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
-Yeah, yeah.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.069
You really cashed in
on that favour pretty quick.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.198
Remember, you are a king.
You must project a royal bearing.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.828
Oh, I'm going to give you
a royal bearing.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.674
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let me get a pack of gum.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.029
Can I get a pack of gum, please?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.952
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty...

20:36.120 --> 20:38.839
...but we don't accept bills
with lipstick on the president.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.273
What?

20:43.160 --> 20:45.879
So I had it all along.
How do you like that?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.838
I guess I owe that cashier
an apology.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.555
Oh, my God.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.595
No, no, Deena,
it's not what you think.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.228
This isn't mine.
I got it from the lnstitute.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.550
The lnstitute!

21:13.040 --> 21:14.234
Mr. Haarwood.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.789
Well, you certainly know
how to dress for a premiere.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.109
Well, thank you.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.989
-Where is your friend, King Henry?
-He ran away.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.233
-Hey, Kramer.
-Let me talk to you.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.994
You know, that button
looks very familiar.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.196
Yes, it's antique ivory.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.679
I think that's my button.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.671
You know, I've been
looking all over for it.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.110
-Did you find it here?
-lt was in the lost and found.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.753
-Shall I undo it?
-Yes, of course.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.912
-Oh, thank you.
-I'm a little ticklish.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.752
Tickle, tickle.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.635
We really gotta get
that Elaine a boyfriend.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.597
Oh, tell me about it.
