RODRIGO:
We could talk.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.871
Sorry, the music is
giving me a headache.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.125
RODRIGO:
Sir? Excuse me.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.169
Sumimasen, do you mind?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.962
Yeah. Yes, the music, yes.

Please, just... down more.
More. More.

Yes.

Arigatou gozaimasu.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.726
We don't have
to do this, you know?

00:58.768 --> 01:00.936
-I thought you wanted to.
-I did.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.481
I do. You already
set it all up.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.780
I think you're gonna love this.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.408
You know, drinking a tea
just becomes an art form.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.869
It's incredible.
It's so, you know,

01:16.911 --> 01:20.539
all the little details
of the whole-- it's amazing.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.916
And the legend behind it says

01:21.957 --> 01:25.002
that there was a monk
called Daruma,

01:25.044 --> 01:28.005
who sat awake for seven years,

01:28.047 --> 01:30.007
and one day, he fell asleep.

01:30.049 --> 01:34.011
So he was so infuriated
that he cut his eyelids off

01:34.053 --> 01:35.638
and threw them in the dirt,

01:35.679 --> 01:38.224
and a tea plant grew from there.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.355
We can talk about
something else.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.315
HAILEY:
Okay.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.110
You didn't tell me
what you did last night.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.447
Yeah.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.075
I guess we do have
a lot to talk about.

01:57.827 --> 02:00.663
Master DeSousa,
I'm Miss Aki, your interpreter.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.414
Please this way.
Everything is prepared for you

02:02.456 --> 02:04.166
and your guest.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.507
AKI: Every detail of a Japanese
garden is carefully planned,

02:11.549 --> 02:14.677
from the color of the mosses
to the shape of the pond

02:14.718 --> 02:16.720
to the texture of the rocks.

02:16.762 --> 02:19.306
And seeing the landscape
in miniature helps you reflect

02:19.348 --> 02:22.434
on the transience of life--
to foster an attitude

02:22.476 --> 02:25.312
of appreciation and
a mindfulness of beauty,

02:25.354 --> 02:28.858
which is central
to a well-lived life.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.109
Sorry, I've never
done this before.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.110
Is there anything
I should know

02:31.151 --> 02:33.988
about the tea ceremony?

02:34.029 --> 02:36.073
Boil water, make tea
and drink it.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.075
This is the essence
of the ceremony.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.122
Told you it was pretty wild.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.833
AKI: This is Mrs. Kimura,
our Teishu.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.543
Her family has been doing
the tea ceremony

02:47.585 --> 02:49.086
for many, many generations.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.296
(Aki and Mrs. Kimura
speak Japanese)

02:50.337 --> 02:53.007
RODRIGO/HAILEY:
Konnichiwa.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.425
Here, we wash the hands
and the mouth

02:54.466 --> 02:56.886
to purify our mind and soul.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.019
Please.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.813
Each element of the tea ceremony
is designed to promote

03:07.855 --> 03:11.734
harmony, respect,
purity and tranquility.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.028
You will see that the art of tea
is very simple:

03:14.069 --> 03:16.447
Lay the charcoal so
that it heats the water,

03:16.488 --> 03:18.741
arrange the flowers
as they are in the field,

03:18.782 --> 03:20.784
and give those with whom
you find yourself

03:20.826 --> 03:22.328
every consideration.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.955
Then share a delicious bowl
of tea.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.832
This creates a heart-to-heart
connection,

03:26.874 --> 03:29.209
so that the boundaries
between us come down.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.296
The Buddhists say this is
the main cause of our suffering.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.468
Are we gonna go
through that cat door?

03:37.509 --> 03:39.803
The door is small so that
everyone is at the same level

03:39.845 --> 03:41.597
when they come to take tea.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.860
-But be careful not to touch
the black lines.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.820
Just in case there's a ninja
who might be hiding

03:56.862 --> 03:58.447
under the house,
and who could thrust his sword

03:58.489 --> 04:01.033
up through the mat.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.952
There is always an alcove
in the tea room

04:02.993 --> 04:04.745
with calligraphy
and fresh flowers

04:04.787 --> 04:06.413
reflecting the season.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.374
Please, let's sit.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.130
So, this scroll,
selected by Mrs. Kimura

04:15.172 --> 04:17.800
for this unique occasion,
has the saying:

04:17.841 --> 04:19.551
"Ichi go ichi e."

04:19.593 --> 04:22.513
It means: one life,
one opportunity

04:22.554 --> 04:24.181
to be present with each other

04:24.223 --> 04:26.642
and to pay full attention
to this distinct time

04:26.684 --> 04:28.477
and experience.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.522
Please, take off any jewelry.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.276
This is to not call
undue attention to oneself.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.453
Do you hear the sound
the water makes?

04:46.495 --> 04:50.207
It's called Matsukaze,
or "pine wind."

04:50.249 --> 04:52.418
In the ceremony,
we don't use a thermometer,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.628
but we know when the water
is ready because it makes

04:54.670 --> 04:56.922
the sound of the wind
in the pine trees.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.857
Arigatou gozaimasu.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.168
Ippuku sashi agemasu.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.088
AKI: This is a traditional
greeting that means,

05:38.130 --> 05:40.007
"I'd like to serve you
some tea."

06:20.547 --> 06:24.384
Okashi wo dozo.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.304
Mrs. Kimura has made these
sweets for you, please.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.848
Take the plate
in your left hand...

06:35.854 --> 06:38.857
...and you can cut it with
a wooden pick, if you like.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.984
And then enjoy.

06:49.827 --> 06:53.705
Mm, it's like a little pillow,
you know, from a doll's house.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.582
Very orgasmic.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.283
(wooden implement
clinks lightly)

08:18.999 --> 08:21.793
Arigatou gozaimasu.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.630
AKI:
Since you are the first guest,

08:24.671 --> 08:27.132
you take the bowl
and put it to the side.

08:30.302 --> 08:33.597
And then, you say to your guest,
"Osakini."

08:33.639 --> 08:35.890
"Please excuse me
for going ahead of you."

08:38.434 --> 08:40.812
Osakini.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.065
Excuse me
for going ahead of you.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.358
AKI:
And then, you say,

08:44.399 --> 08:46.735
"Otemae chodai itashimasu,"

08:46.777 --> 08:49.988
or, "Thank you. I'm now
going to drink your tea."

08:50.030 --> 08:53.784
Otemae chodai itashimasu.
Thank you.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.869
I'm gonna drink your tea.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.664
Please place the bowl
in your left hand.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.585
Turn it slightly, as it is
a courtesy to the potter

09:03.627 --> 09:05.337
to not drink
from the best side.

09:05.379 --> 09:09.299
And then, you give thanks
in your heart and take a sip.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.305
And then,
you drink the rest of it.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.766
And the last bit, you can slurp.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.720
Hai Lai!

09:54.761 --> 09:57.848
Wow, this tea
is kind of amazing, right?

09:57.889 --> 10:00.309
Finally we can talk.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.894
I'd rather not
talk about last night.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.147
Yeah, I don't want to
talk about last night, no, no.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.982
I want to talk about
tomorrow night.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.650
I want to talk about
the night after that night.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.153
I want to talk about two weeks,
plus a night.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.572
You know, for everything that's
going on in my life right now,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.700
I have to tell you
it's such contentment I find,

10:16.742 --> 10:18.744
you know,
from being your boyfriend.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.495
Nothing could make me happier.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.205
I need nothing more.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.000
We don't need that crazy
"throw yourself out the window"

10:25.042 --> 10:27.085
-kind of love.
-Right.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.712
'Cause I've already had
that kind of love,

10:28.754 --> 10:30.297
and it's-- I don't know--

10:30.339 --> 10:35.552
I'm-I'm more for a kind of soft
and comfortable,

10:35.594 --> 10:38.263
"I can be your boyfriend"
kind of relationship.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.682
That's just what I want.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.602
Really? Wow.
That-that's really good.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.811
You seem surprised.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.021
Yeah, just a little, yeah.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.689
Why?

10:47.731 --> 10:49.232
I don't know.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.152
I felt that maybe you,
you blamed me

10:52.194 --> 10:56.281
for losing the stupid
competition or something.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.742
What? No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:58.784 --> 11:01.119
You were nothing
but supportive.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.454
Oh, really?

11:02.496 --> 11:03.872
Oh, that's great,
because, you know,

11:03.914 --> 11:05.040
I-I thought you wanted
something from me

11:05.082 --> 11:06.500
that I couldn't give.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.918
That's incredible
that you feel that way.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.294
Who?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.629
You.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.341
Hang on, no.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.968
Hai Lai, don't-don't do this,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.553
because this is
already trippy enough.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.181
I'm not the real Hai Lai.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.642
Real Hai Lai's in the tea room.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.852
I'm the just the Hai Lai
that's in your mind.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.479
So I'll say whatever you want.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.398
This was just a tease?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.607
Be honest with her.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.192
I'm always honest with her.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.277
Just tell her about
your biological necessities,

11:34.319 --> 11:35.737
that-that you cannot
sleep alone.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.031
She knows that
I cannot sleep alone.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.617
We get along, we have a laugh,

11:40.659 --> 11:42.661
we like to be in bed--
you and I--

11:42.702 --> 11:43.829
Hai Lai, a lot, no?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.831
We do.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.959
I just need something more.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.502
What?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.674
Okay, let's just be together,
you and I, you know?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.884
No problems, no dramas.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.637
You like this whole boyfriend
and girlfriend thing, right?

12:00.679 --> 12:02.347
Hai Lai

12:02.389 --> 12:04.433
Oh, man, you blew it.
You blew it.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.643
You cannot tell a girl
that you're not madly,

12:06.685 --> 12:08.437
-deeply in love with her. I...
-It's okay.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.105
With-with real girlfriend
and boyfriend,

12:10.147 --> 12:11.606
you can tell everything.
That's the whole point.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.108
No, no, she said it.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.317
You didn't listen.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.694
She needs something else.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.154
I felt her drifting away.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.197
Yeah, she was drifting away
because that's how you get

12:19.239 --> 12:21.408
to a place that you want to go
in this place.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.952
Well, you-you two have to
evolve with each other.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.162
I don't want to evolve, no.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.872
No, I want to...

12:26.913 --> 12:30.417
I'm enjoying this kind of, oh,
Hamlet-ian crisis right now.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.043
I like it.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.463
I like the comfort
that she gives me.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.630
What's wrong with that?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.424
Comfort?

12:37.466 --> 12:40.760
That's the worst word for
an artist, as far as I can tell.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.638
You know,
you have to grow up, man.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.682
Don't tell me about growing up.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.727
I'm just going through some
work-related crisis right now.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.604
I-- it's so--
you try to confuse me.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.189
Where the fuck are we?

12:52.230 --> 12:54.065
And what kind of a fantasy
is this?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.984
-This is my mind.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.819
Yeah, I'm having some tea
so it's fine.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.779
It's-it's no big deal.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.531
Look, I-I wanted to
tell you something

13:01.573 --> 13:04.284
and I know you probably know
the answer in your heart, but...

13:04.326 --> 13:06.203
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, you've got

13:06.244 --> 13:08.121
a beautiful,
budding relationship

13:08.163 --> 13:10.582
with an extraordinary,
talented young woman.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.918
But you've got to take it
the rest of the way.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.544
Well, I like it the way it is.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.921
"The way it is."

13:15.962 --> 13:17.756
The way it is,
that's a kiss of death.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.466
You have to evolve.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.220
You've got to find
profound new experiences.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.555
I mean, of course,
you've got to have the balls.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.766
I have the balls.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.352
All right, then, as a man,

13:30.393 --> 13:32.145
you have to experience the joy

13:32.187 --> 13:35.982
-of holding your very own child
in your arms. -Mm.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.527
To... to love them,
to smell them,

13:38.568 --> 13:40.445
to live your life through them,

13:40.487 --> 13:43.365
even though they may shit
all over your fingers.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.242
And I want it for you now.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.078
Oh, I was thinking about that,
but... but maybe not now.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.121
Yes, now. This is the time.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.957
Look, you're not
getting any younger.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.377
You know, your-your face,
it's starting to fade a bit,

13:55.418 --> 13:56.878
-No.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.214
I've just got
one question for you.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.175
Is this what she wants, too?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.847
Of course.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.016
Of course,
this is what she wants.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.443
-Oy. -AKI: It's been said
that a bowl of tea

14:20.485 --> 14:24.239
is the universe
held between the palms.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.951
Yeah. Yeah, I-I agree.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.462
Place the bowl in front of you

14:39.504 --> 14:44.259
and then you say,
"Otemae chodai itashimasu."

14:44.301 --> 14:47.095
Otemae chodai itashimasu.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.055
Mm-hmm.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.142
And then...

15:06.031 --> 15:08.658
:
Hello?

15:09.784 --> 15:12.078
Hello!

15:13.872 --> 15:17.042
I'm fucking pissed!

15:18.668 --> 15:22.172
: I wanted
to win that competition!

15:22.213 --> 15:25.175
I should've won!

15:25.216 --> 15:29.054
I'm ready for something new,
something fucking epic!

15:29.095 --> 15:33.058
This is my fucking
moment in life!

15:33.099 --> 15:39.272
I want to get lost in-in wine
and strange lands and strangers.

15:39.314 --> 15:43.109
And I want to be
the fucking crazy one, for once.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.736
I want to be
the fucking crazy one!

15:44.778 --> 15:46.154
And I don't want to give a shit

15:46.196 --> 15:48.406
about messing up
someone else's day!

15:48.448 --> 15:51.326
So long as it's in service
of my art!

15:51.368 --> 15:52.994
Whoa, what the fuck?
Cool down.

15:53.036 --> 15:56.247
Oh, my God, Lizzie, I wish
that you were really here.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.751
-You're losing your grip, dude.
-I'm so confused, man.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.462
Well, what's the problem?
I mean, he adores you.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.340
You have a great time together;
I mean, he cooks you breakfast.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.800
You teach him,
you learn from him.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.218
I mean, what more do you want?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.511
Nothing, not a thing.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.471
But it's not about him,
it's about me.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.598
-I'm losing myself.
-You're just scared.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.934
And you're leaning towards
a romantic cliché--

16:15.975 --> 16:17.852
that you can't be yourself
without being alone.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.562
I'll be ready
for someone else later.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.981
-Right now, I need to focus
on me.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.150
I mean, this is the moment
that matters, right?

16:24.192 --> 16:25.735
Ichi go ichi e?

16:25.777 --> 16:26.986
"One life, one opportunity."

16:27.028 --> 16:28.738
Oh, I know. I know.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.825
I mean, who else in the world is
more dynamic, more charismatic?

16:31.866 --> 16:34.411
Not to mention the great sex
I've heard you talk about.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.996
I mean, who do you have
more of a connection with,

16:37.038 --> 16:39.582
that's more engaging,
fun to be around,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.793
knowledgeable about music
and passionate about art?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.003
I mean, all the things
you want in your life.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.755
No one.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.883
I think that you should commit
in a deeper, crazier way.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.303
I think that that would be
daring and beautiful.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.305
You're right.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.808
If you wait too long,
he'll be gone.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.435
We belong together.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.228
ANA MARIA:
Charming thought.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.480
But you're never
gonna get him. Not fully.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.107
Go ahead, commit.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.233
Just don't expect
the same from him.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.903
Trust me, you're not his type.
You're like a pillow.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.156
-Okay. I'm just
talking to my friend right now.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.450
He needs the fire!

17:13.491 --> 17:16.578
-The fire of a deeper,
crazy love. -Okay.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.787
Like we had.

17:17.829 --> 17:18.997
Maybe still have.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.832
What are you saying?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.625
I'm saying you're
too much of a mouse.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.377
You're not crazy enough.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.962
Fuck you, you pretentious
fucking asshole.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.714
LIZZIE:
Yeah, fuck you.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.591
You got a problem with her,
you have a problem with me.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.885
If I hadn't taken
a vow of nonviolence...

17:31.926 --> 17:33.178
:
I still carry a knife.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.013
Hey, guys, guys. Hey. Hey.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.306
Hey.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.057
If you're not crazy already,

17:38.099 --> 17:40.769
if you stay with him, trust me,
he'll drive you crazy.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.771
Look at me.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.231
You make every woman who's
with you go a little insane.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.858
-No. Hai Lai,
don't listen to her.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.401
No, I'm not that kind
of person anymore.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.237
Come. I need
to tell you something.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.031
I'm sorry, Hai Lai.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.409
You were doing so well in the
competition and I messed you up.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.036
You should have won.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.122
No, I did it to myself. I froze.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.000
I just didn't want to be there,
and I couldn't be in the moment.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.377
And that's what
always happens to me.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.545
Always?

18:07.587 --> 18:08.713
Not always.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.673
Just when it really matters.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.520
AKI: So, now you ask,
"May I see the tea container

18:23.561 --> 18:25.855
and the tea scoop, please?"

18:25.897 --> 18:27.690
"Onatsume."
-Onatsume. -Onatsume.

18:27.732 --> 18:28.942
"Ocha shaku."

18:28.983 --> 18:30.401
-Ocha shaku.
-Ocha shaku.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.487
-"No haiken."
-No haiken. -No haiken.

18:32.529 --> 18:33.905
-AKI: "Onegai"
-Onegai. -Onegai.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.449
-AKI: Itashimas.
-Itashimas. -Itashimas.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.412
AKI: You may see
little hills and valleys,

18:41.454 --> 18:45.416
formed by the scoop
as it withdrew from the tea.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.169
It's like bamboo.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.339
From the forest.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.924
RODRIGO:
Hmm.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.385
AKI: This is why tea
takes a lifetime to master.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.387
Everything tells a story.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.738
Is this the real you, Hai Lai?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.782
Or it is me
just thinking about you?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.993
It's really me.

19:20.034 --> 19:24.080
There's so much things I've been
thinking about, recently.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.709
I feel I'm entering
a new perspective.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.712
I'm realizing new things
about myself.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.631
Me, too.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.134
There's so much
I want to tell you.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.887
Not now.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.266
Just be here with me.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.310
Just hold me.

19:53.401 --> 19:57.739
I never told you this,
with all my heart.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.033
I'm in love with you.

20:00.074 --> 20:03.244
I'm in love with you, too.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.288
Truly.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.171
Listen.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.173
It's the Concerto in C.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.385
You played it so beautifully.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.470
The day we met.

21:02.512 --> 21:06.516
A day I will never forget.
