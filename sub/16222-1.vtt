02:20.957 --> 02:23.187
This walk is exactly
what you need.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.990
You've been coiled up like a spring.
I don't even know who you are anymore.

02:26.029 --> 02:28.259
It's a big meeting, I'd think
you'd be a little nervous.

02:28.298 --> 02:31.233
I don't get nervous, Dan. I get excited.

02:32.202 --> 02:34.170
Please don't tell the story.

02:34.204 --> 02:36.035
You're a people person,
Charlie, that's wonderful,

02:36.072 --> 02:38.802
but in business meetings you tell
personal items from my life,

02:38.842 --> 02:41.709
- and it embarrasses me.
- Girls, girls, girls!

02:41.744 --> 02:45.475
Hey! Ten miles!

02:45.515 --> 02:48.245
I'm sorry, Lucky.

02:48.284 --> 02:51.151
I think he's too old for sprints.
I can hear his legs clicking.

02:51.187 --> 02:52.677
Those are my knees.

02:52.722 --> 02:55.452
Do you really think I tell
that story for my own amusement?

02:55.491 --> 02:57.550
I do it because it's a sales tool.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.585
Charlie, let's win this account
on our pitch.

02:59.629 --> 03:01.460
It's sports marketing.
You need an edge.

03:01.497 --> 03:05.126
- I don't want to be the edge.
- Hey, mister! Little help!

03:05.168 --> 03:06.795
Sure thing, guys!

03:08.137 --> 03:09.934
Whoa!

03:09.973 --> 03:12.237
- Ow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:12.275 --> 03:15.267
- Why did you do that?
- My bad! Sorry!

03:15.311 --> 03:18.109
- I didn't mean to.
- You're a monster!

03:18.147 --> 03:19.808
I'm sorry!

03:19.849 --> 03:21.612
You're allergic to anything
under four feet. You're a mess.

03:21.651 --> 03:24.620
- Promise you won't tell the story.
- Fine. I won't tell the story.

03:25.321 --> 03:28.290
OK, you guys want to hear
the greatest Dan Rayburn story ever?

03:28.324 --> 03:30.417
- No, don't.
- Please. Come on, Danny.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.429
All right. Seven years ago,
Dan's divorce had just come through

03:33.463 --> 03:35.693
and his ex-wife had
left his heart in tatters.

03:35.732 --> 03:38.462
And his bank account drained.
Tell them that.

03:38.501 --> 03:41.095
He was taking it pretty well.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.662
That's good.
You're taking it like a man!

03:43.706 --> 03:46.402
Stiff upper lip! Getting smart!

03:47.477 --> 03:49.877
- What?
- Oh, God!

03:49.913 --> 03:52.074
<i>People say I saved
my partner's life that day.</i>

03:53.750 --> 03:55.980
So many people get divorced.

03:56.019 --> 03:59.284
And neither one of you wanted kids.
Now that seems like a stroke of genius!

03:59.322 --> 04:02.621
But that didn't console him.
I had to act. I had to do something.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.117
Mr. Good Time is going to
teach you how to live! Yeah!

04:06.162 --> 04:09.757
- Why are there two pieces of luggage?
- Oh, just a little jaunt.

04:11.067 --> 04:13.262
Nothing too wild.

04:14.737 --> 04:18.399
Hey, Mr. Good Times.
You said we'd come to Miami, we did.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.499
Can we go home now?

04:19.541 --> 04:21.373
Whoa!

04:21.411 --> 04:22.878
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

04:22.912 --> 04:24.504
Does this drink
come with a diving board?

04:24.547 --> 04:26.811
It's insane! Just a sip, I think.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.477
So as a best friend, I felt compelled

04:29.519 --> 04:32.181
to give him a gentle reminder
of what it was like to be free.

04:32.922 --> 04:35.584
- I want it to say: "free man!"
- Free man.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.024
Big letters, right across his chest.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.028
<i>"Free man!" Comprende?</i>

04:40.029 --> 04:43.192
Oh. Good night, nurse.

04:45.234 --> 04:47.031
<i>I could have sworn
that guy spoke English.</i>

04:47.070 --> 04:50.403
It was supposed to say "free man."

04:50.440 --> 04:52.806
Fremont, Fremont, Fremont...

04:53.943 --> 04:55.308
Free man!

04:59.082 --> 05:03.143
It's funny, guys.
Come on. They love it.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.612
Then the unexpected happened.

05:05.655 --> 05:09.091
Look at all the babes.
Don't look, don't look. Now look.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.252
<i>Fourteen hours after
signing his divorce papers,</i>

05:11.294 --> 05:13.956
<i>Dan met Vicki, the girl of his dreams.</i>

05:13.997 --> 05:15.692
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.199
Girl in white,
eleven o'clock.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.724
- Yeah, but...
- Oh, give her the Queen's wave.

05:19.769 --> 05:22.203
- No, the other Queen.
- Oh. Hello.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.899
<i>She was traveling
with a friend.</i>

05:23.940 --> 05:26.704
<i>I thought maybe the friend
was a magician or a jazz dancer,</i>

05:26.743 --> 05:28.301
<i>because of the way
she was moving her hands.</i>

05:28.344 --> 05:30.209
Turns out she's a hand model.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.544
- ... hand model.
- A hand model?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.981
They model with their hands.

05:35.451 --> 05:37.578
So, within minutes,
Dan is back to his old self.

05:37.620 --> 05:41.056
No, scratch that.
He's better than his old self.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.557
Charlie, look at these pictures!

05:42.592 --> 05:45.322
My whole life I've never taken
a good picture.

05:45.361 --> 05:48.296
<i>¶ No matter how
they toss the dice, it had to be ¶</i>

05:48.331 --> 05:49.730
<i>I'd never seen him
so free, OK?</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:52.064
<i>I mean, so impulsive.
He was a changed man.</i>

05:54.370 --> 05:56.565
<i>Or maybe not so changed.</i>

05:56.606 --> 05:59.575
<i>It's hard to explain to a guy
who's never had an impulsive moment</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:02.077
<i>in his life there's
two kinds of impulsives.</i>

06:02.111 --> 06:05.046
The good kind, OK,
but this is plain stupid!

06:06.549 --> 06:08.278
That was so romantic.

06:11.387 --> 06:15.983
But when he woke up, he remembered,
"I was just married 14 painful years

06:16.025 --> 06:18.016
- and I've gone and done it again!"
- Whoops.

06:18.061 --> 06:23.158
To a woman that
he barely knows. His "soul mate."

06:24.634 --> 06:27.432
...soul mate.
- Soul mate!

06:29.839 --> 06:31.067
Soul mate!

06:36.579 --> 06:38.444
They never laugh this much.

06:39.782 --> 06:43.309
<i>So, a few hours later,
my buddy here, my hombre,</i>

06:43.352 --> 06:47.186
is the only guy I know that's been
divorced twice in a 24-hour period.

06:47.223 --> 06:51.717
Now, that's a true story.

06:51.761 --> 06:55.424
Fremont! Fremont! Fremont!

06:58.868 --> 07:02.827
- It was supposed to say "free man."
- But it didn't. It said "Fremont."

07:02.872 --> 07:05.397
It's a big mistake.
It's on his chest forever.

07:05.441 --> 07:10.970
I don't really think that story
honors the feelings I had for her.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.811
No, I'm sorry.
Dan, people love that story.

07:13.850 --> 07:18.082
So just get up there and do
your thing. Because I killed.

07:18.121 --> 07:19.247
<i>Banzai!</i>

07:19.288 --> 07:21.552
<i>Ixnay on the banzai.</i>

07:21.591 --> 07:23.388
Nishamura Media Group

07:23.426 --> 07:26.520
entering the US sports market
is a huge deal.

07:26.562 --> 07:29.224
Now, I know you've met
with larger groups,

07:29.265 --> 07:33.895
but I'm about to show you
why working with a boutique firm

07:33.936 --> 07:37.895
run by two seasoned pros
is a smart move for you.

07:39.642 --> 07:42.133
Forty-seven million dollars
over five years.

07:42.178 --> 07:44.669
Man, you better shape up
on your Japanese,

07:44.714 --> 07:46.204
'cause you're going to Tokyo, baby!

07:46.249 --> 07:48.877
Thank you. This is the kind of
opportunity I've been looking for.

07:48.918 --> 07:52.445
And you will not be sorry.
In college my nickname was "GT."

07:52.488 --> 07:56.356
- That's "Go To." You go to me.
- What's the matter with you?

07:56.392 --> 07:59.122
Biggest deal of our lives
isn't exciting enough for you?

07:59.162 --> 08:02.222
So it's a done deal now?
There are a few small details.

08:02.265 --> 08:03.892
Like next week when Nishamura
and his son come to town

08:03.933 --> 08:05.400
we have to win them over
on the golf course.

08:05.434 --> 08:06.901
- That'll be easy.
- I'm great at golf.

08:06.936 --> 08:09.166
Then, two weeks from now,
we have to make a presentation

08:09.205 --> 08:11.366
- to their executive board of directors.
- Done.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.500
All right, sunshine.
What's really wrong with you?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.072
I was not divorced twice, OK?

08:17.113 --> 08:18.876
One of them was an annulment.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.475
- Look at that face!
- Charlie, don't!

08:21.517 --> 08:23.382
Look at this, Craig.
You know what this face is?

08:23.419 --> 08:25.410
- The face of a winner.
- This face is willing to hibernate

08:25.454 --> 08:28.321
for six months to make the
best deal he could possibly make.

08:28.357 --> 08:31.986
And I don't care who knows it. A toast
to my best buddy and business partner,

08:32.028 --> 08:33.825
- Dan Rayburn! Whoo!
- Whoo!

08:33.863 --> 08:35.763
<i>Arigato!</i>

08:42.972 --> 08:44.234
It all comes down to this.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.740
- I don't think so.
- Three, two, one.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.367
This one's the shooter.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.672
- Let's see it.
- Golden moment.

08:50.379 --> 08:51.744
- Oh. Uh-oh!
- Oh, you're just sinkin' em.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.578
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.675
Let's hit it. There you go.

08:55.718 --> 08:57.185
- It's a leaking dog.
- Yeah.

08:57.220 --> 09:00.986
That's a... That's a neat trick.
How old is that dog?

09:01.023 --> 09:03.514
I lost count. Vet said it was a record.

09:03.559 --> 09:06.289
You might want to put
a diaper on him, or underwear.

09:07.396 --> 09:10.194
- Yo.
- Hey. Where you been?

09:10.233 --> 09:12.758
Japanese real estate agents.
Some apartments for Craig-san.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.827
Thank you. I just want to find
something authentic.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.929
I've been getting so immersed
in Japanese culture,

09:16.973 --> 09:19.441
by the time I hit Tokyo, they're
going to think I'm part Japanese.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.636
They'll be like, "Who is this local?"

09:21.677 --> 09:25.340
I don't care if you stay on the top
of Mount Fuji. Just bring home the yen.

09:25.381 --> 09:28.077
- This can't be.
- What do you got?

09:29.118 --> 09:30.813
- Vicki.
- Vicki who?

09:30.853 --> 09:33.048
South Beach Vicki? She's in town.

09:33.089 --> 09:37.048
- She wants to see me. Today.
- She just called you out of the blue?

09:38.127 --> 09:39.992
- No.
- Dan? Dan?

09:40.029 --> 09:42.827
You know last Christmas
when I moved in to the condo?

09:42.865 --> 09:45.356
I was feeling really lonely.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.733
And maybe I wrote a seven-to-ten-page
single-spaced letter.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.000
Oh, Dan.

09:50.039 --> 09:52.064
You've been using your feelings
for this woman

09:52.108 --> 09:53.575
to avoid your life for seven years.

09:53.609 --> 09:57.705
I set you up in the most exclusive
adult-only condo.

09:57.747 --> 09:59.214
You've never been to theme nights.

09:59.248 --> 10:02.217
You never once went to the
Sunday morning schmooze and schmeer.

10:02.251 --> 10:04.481
You know, maybe she hasn't
moved on either.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.010
- Well, you can't do it.
- Why?

10:06.055 --> 10:08.216
Because we're in the middle
of our biggest deal ever,

10:08.257 --> 10:09.349
and you don't have the time.

10:09.392 --> 10:12.589
She lives in Vermont. It's perfect.
Start of a long-distance relationship.

10:12.628 --> 10:14.926
You get six to nine months
of the spa weekends,

10:14.964 --> 10:17.432
late-night phone calls.
I'd still have my days free to work.

10:17.466 --> 10:19.127
She wants to meet me
at Grand Central Station,

10:19.168 --> 10:20.533
and I don't know what
I'm supposed to wear.

10:20.569 --> 10:23.094
It's not formal, obviously,
it's a train station,

10:23.139 --> 10:25.539
but do I wear a sport coat,
or coat and tie...

10:25.574 --> 10:27.474
You can wear a sports coat,
but you're not going like that.

10:27.510 --> 10:28.943
- Why?
- 'Cause you look like an albino.

10:31.714 --> 10:35.650
This is his first time, so you can see
his complexion is ghost-like.

10:35.685 --> 10:38.017
- What do you think of the El Tropical?
- Perfect beginner's tan.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.715
- Oh, great.
- Yeah. Let's go!

10:39.755 --> 10:41.279
- You all set?
- Oh, yeah.

10:41.324 --> 10:46.227
- I'm ready. Alrighty, let's do this.
- Um... so...

10:46.262 --> 10:49.891
Face forward, press the red button,
spray lasts ten seconds.

10:49.932 --> 10:53.527
Keep your eyes closed and call me
on the intercom when you're done.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.934
OK.

10:56.839 --> 11:01.367
Eyes closed. She wanted a golden god,
she's going to get one.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.435
Whoa, um...

11:03.479 --> 11:05.811
HAL?

11:05.848 --> 11:09.648
I definitely think that the tan line
accentuates the look, don't you?

11:09.685 --> 11:11.243
- Uh-huh. Sexy.
- Mmm.

11:11.287 --> 11:15.519
I'm gonna start now.

11:21.364 --> 11:22.592
Whoa!

11:29.138 --> 11:31.504
One... Whoa!

11:31.540 --> 11:35.499
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

11:35.544 --> 11:39.446
Seven. Eight. Nine. OK!

11:39.482 --> 11:40.915
Hello!

11:44.754 --> 11:45.982
I'm finished!

11:47.056 --> 11:48.580
Be there in a sec.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.422
So, do you, like, really know Shaq?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.519
- Whose numbers are those?
- Oh, my gosh.

11:57.566 --> 12:00.967
We have a problem here!

12:01.003 --> 12:05.269
- Shaq! Yeah, Charlie.
- It's not turning off!

12:05.307 --> 12:08.174
- Tell him your name.
- Shaq? Hi, it's Kelly.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.438
Anybody out there?

12:09.478 --> 12:11.776
Do you remember me?
I went to one of your games.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.838
Help!

12:12.882 --> 12:15.112
Yeah. I don't know who
you were playing against, but...

12:15.151 --> 12:17.312
I have an emergency here!

12:17.353 --> 12:19.514
<i>Help!</i>

12:20.623 --> 12:23.217
Just relax. Be there in a sec.

12:23.259 --> 12:24.726
Help!

12:24.760 --> 12:27.490
- A tanning emergency?
- Newbies.

12:29.031 --> 12:30.430
Keep the heat kind of medium...

12:31.934 --> 12:33.424
Throw a little bit of butter, and...

12:51.620 --> 12:55.056
<i>Westbound local
now arriving on track two.</i>

12:55.090 --> 12:57.320
<i>Westbound local now arriving.</i>

13:05.835 --> 13:06.859
I'm from Hoboken.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.339
What am I, the United Nations?
This is crazy.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.539
Look, Mom,
it's an Oompa-Loompa.

13:18.581 --> 13:20.811
I'm an Oompa-Loompa. I can't do this!

13:20.850 --> 13:23.978
- Excuse me...
- Dan?

13:25.754 --> 13:27.016
Vicki?

13:27.056 --> 13:30.048
- Wow!
- Hey!

13:30.092 --> 13:32.060
- I mean, hi!
- Hi.

13:32.094 --> 13:34.961
Look at you! You're so tan.

13:34.997 --> 13:37.363
Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.960
Boca. Volleyball, and...
Look at you. You're hot!

13:41.003 --> 13:42.698
- Thanks, Tan.
- Dan.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.298
- I mean, Dan.
- I'm Tan Dan.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.710
I got us a table upstairs.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.836
- Let's eat. Yeah.
- Shall we?

13:55.851 --> 13:57.716
- Thank you.
- Oh!

14:01.557 --> 14:05.152
I really don't know where to start, Dan.
But...

14:07.096 --> 14:08.620
I need to share it with...

14:08.664 --> 14:11.599
Stop... in the name of love.

14:13.536 --> 14:17.233
Look, seven years ago,
we made magic happen.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.366
But it was bad timing.

14:19.408 --> 14:23.606
Now, we'll take it super slow,
there'll be no outside distractions.

14:24.513 --> 14:28.313
Just us. I, um...

14:28.350 --> 14:32.150
I'm ready to put these back together.
All I need is your half.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.018
- I'm going to jail.
- What?

14:34.056 --> 14:36.422
Tomorrow. Two weeks for trespassing.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.892
- Why?
- A chemical company wanted

14:38.928 --> 14:42.159
to build a plant that would've
drained into a stream near my house.

14:42.197 --> 14:45.132
So I kind of chained myself
to a bulldozer

14:45.167 --> 14:46.657
and burned the blueprints to the plant.

14:46.702 --> 14:48.602
Look at you.
You're a political activist.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.765
Well, I had ulterior motives.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.742
- You're... Career politician?
- My kids.

14:54.777 --> 14:56.938
Zach and Emily play near that stream.

14:58.013 --> 14:59.605
Kids.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.344
You know, I just never thought that...

15:02.384 --> 15:06.377
You... you'd be attached. But...

15:06.422 --> 15:08.720
Actually, I'm a single mom.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.849
You kidder!

15:10.893 --> 15:13.191
- Twins!
- Ouch!

15:13.228 --> 15:17.096
Yeah. They think I'm going
to a spa named Westford Farms.

15:17.132 --> 15:19.100
Whoops!

15:19.134 --> 15:20.999
You remember my best friend,
Jenna, from South Beach.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.799
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, the hand model.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.204
They're staying with her.
She's like family.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.835
You got so much going on, girl.
It just blows my mind.

15:28.877 --> 15:31.675
That's good, because there's
one other small detail.

15:31.714 --> 15:33.648
- What is it?
- Daddy!

15:38.954 --> 15:40.922
You guys weren't supposed
to be back for 45 minutes!

15:40.956 --> 15:42.583
I'm... Da... Da...

15:42.625 --> 15:45.321
Oh! Hey, look who's panicking again.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.163
He does not look good.
I'm calling the paramedics.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.262
No! I'm OK.

15:59.108 --> 16:01.201
Guys, would you give us
a minute? Please.

16:13.322 --> 16:18.817
Dan, I got your letter six months ago,
and I won't lie, it threw me for a loop.

16:18.861 --> 16:21.261
I was completely ready to go it alone.

16:22.264 --> 16:23.891
But here was this...

16:25.868 --> 16:30.396
...12-page, single-spaced letter
from the father of my kids,

16:30.973 --> 16:33.999
and suddenly
I had to ask if I was being selfish.

16:34.610 --> 16:37.408
Then three weeks ago,
we were in Friday's for dinner,

16:37.446 --> 16:39.778
and Zach had to go to the bathroom,
and as I was taking him

16:39.815 --> 16:42.443
to the ladies' room
for the umpteenth time...

16:43.385 --> 16:45.979
...I realized, he's never
even been in a men's room.

16:46.021 --> 16:49.957
- Really?
- My kids are seven. They have a father.

16:50.526 --> 16:53.757
So I thought, maybe it's time
they got to know who he is.

16:55.064 --> 17:00.195
I have to confess, I've always been
a little awkward around children.

17:02.905 --> 17:06.340
But I guess, if they're your own,
it's a different ballgame.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.573
Well, we got a few hours to kill
while Jenna goes out on a hand audition.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.739
- Let's find out.
- OK.

17:12.781 --> 17:18.413
But first, what do you say
we get rid of that ridiculous tan?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.285
I know a few family secrets.

17:20.321 --> 17:22.483
- You don't like it?
- I'm sorry, do you like it?

17:22.523 --> 17:24.651
- Not at all.
- OK.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.386
- How's your face feel?
- Oh, pretty much everything.

17:28.897 --> 17:31.127
- Come on, Dad!
- Oh, no.

17:31.166 --> 17:33.691
Not the spinning one.
That's a recipe for disaster.

17:33.736 --> 17:36.261
Hey, Dad? Want to see my
Five Favorite Food lists?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.670
Oh, I'd love to, Z. Thanks.

17:37.706 --> 17:40.174
- Zach likes to make lists.
- I love lists.

17:40.209 --> 17:42.439
- Hot wings and milkshakes.
- Chocolate?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.105
Oh, no, it gives me diarrhea.

17:44.146 --> 17:48.310
I mean, stomach problems
and frequent gas-spasms.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.215
- Oh.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

17:50.252 --> 17:51.378
Oh, OK.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.115
Hang on. Can you watch Emily?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.589
- Sure.
- I want to go to the men's room.

17:56.358 --> 17:57.416
With me?

17:58.560 --> 17:59.584
OK.

18:07.202 --> 18:10.535
You're pretty old. How come
you don't have any other kids?

18:10.572 --> 18:12.267
Well, um...

18:13.776 --> 18:15.334
Initially, it was kind of a...

18:15.377 --> 18:17.845
You do know where kids
come from, right?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.849
- Yeah, sure.
- Can you tell me?

18:24.620 --> 18:26.383
Well, um...

18:26.421 --> 18:31.654
In nature, the male and
the female of the species, uh,

18:31.693 --> 18:36.562
in what some have called the
"dance of springtime," you know...

18:36.598 --> 18:40.193
It's complicated.

18:42.638 --> 18:45.368
Do I just stand here?

18:45.407 --> 18:47.272
My mom usually waits outside.

18:47.309 --> 18:49.368
I'll bet she does. I'm out of here.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.115
OK.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.878
- Ooh! You're early.
- Hi, hon!

19:00.923 --> 19:02.982
I can do my hand cream later. Hi!

19:03.025 --> 19:04.424
- Hi, Aunt Jenna!
- Hi.

19:04.459 --> 19:07.485
Hi, Zach. Hello, Emily!

19:08.997 --> 19:11.056
I booked it!

19:11.099 --> 19:14.535
- I gotta go potty.
- All right. Lemonade inside!

19:14.570 --> 19:16.060
- OK, I got them.
- I got the bags.

19:16.104 --> 19:18.004
- No, no, it's all right...
- No, please.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.606
Oh!

19:20.642 --> 19:22.906
Oh, no! I got it.

19:22.945 --> 19:24.435
OK, I got it.

19:24.479 --> 19:26.379
No, wait. No, please don't.

19:28.350 --> 19:30.648
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe! Breathe!

19:30.686 --> 19:32.176
Oh, sorry!

19:35.958 --> 19:38.825
Oh...

19:40.195 --> 19:42.755
She's gonna be fine. She's a fighter.

19:42.798 --> 19:45.460
She looks good. You look good, hon.

19:49.204 --> 19:52.469
Can you hand me my cell phone?
I have to call my agent.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.669
All right. Here we go. Here it is, hon.

19:58.547 --> 20:01.175
- Do you want help?
- No, no.

20:01.216 --> 20:03.013
I'm going to give you a minute.

20:04.152 --> 20:06.643
I'm so sorry.

20:10.859 --> 20:14.158
Oh, God! What am I gonna do?

20:14.196 --> 20:17.597
Come on, you're a great gal. You must
have plenty of friends you could call.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.193
That I could trust
with my kids for two weeks?

20:20.235 --> 20:24.194
This is a disaster!
I don't have anybody else!

20:24.239 --> 20:27.367
That's not true.
No, no. You have me.

20:27.409 --> 20:30.378
I'll do it. I'll take the kids.

20:33.048 --> 20:34.072
I'll do it.

20:36.551 --> 20:38.485
- I will.
- Really?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.215
Oh, yeah.

20:40.255 --> 20:43.224
Hey, yeah, see?

20:43.258 --> 20:46.887
This is good.
This is a good thing.

20:50.699 --> 20:54.328
- Do you know anybody else?
- No, just me.

20:57.172 --> 21:00.300
And then suddenly,
you're supposed to take care of twins

21:00.342 --> 21:02.810
when we have the biggest deal ever?
Aw, Dan!

21:02.844 --> 21:06.302
I put their aunt in a halo for a month!
What am I supposed to do?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.407
You're supposed to give them back!
They got 24 hours!

21:08.450 --> 21:10.384
- They'll find another baby-sitter!
- I can't give them back!

21:10.419 --> 21:12.717
They're my kids. It's not like puppies.
"Take them back."

21:12.754 --> 21:14.915
- Let's break it down. It's two weeks.
- OK.

21:14.957 --> 21:16.891
- Yeah.
- All right, let's see. We got, uh...

21:16.925 --> 21:18.722
They sleep 10, 12 hours, right, a day?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.421
- If you're lucky.
- You've got TV.

21:20.462 --> 21:23.898
You've got bathroom time.
You give them a lot of timeouts.

21:23.932 --> 21:24.956
You know what?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.491
You're looking at about 90 minutes
of being a dad a day.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.833
Ninety minutes?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.701
It's a run-out-the-clock
situation, that's all.

21:30.739 --> 21:32.229
- It's not sudden death.
- You'll be fine.

21:32.274 --> 21:35.505
- Ha! We can do this.
- "We?" No, no.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.411
You are on Planet Dan now, baby.

21:38.447 --> 21:40.938
I'm down here on Earth,
just cheering you on.

21:40.983 --> 21:44.885
You started this, remember? You're
the one who took me down to Florida.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.718
"Mr. Feel-good" is gonna
teach me how to live.

21:47.756 --> 21:51.248
I wasn't alone then,
I'm not gonna be alone now, OK?

21:51.293 --> 21:55.093
So, tomorrow morning, 7:30, I want you
outside your apartment ready to go.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.530
Because if I'm going to be
an old dad for two weeks,

21:57.566 --> 22:00.330
you're going to be "Uncle Charlie."

22:01.603 --> 22:03.628
Well, I don't want to
take care of the kids!

22:06.975 --> 22:10.069
For both of them, I've packed
enough clothes for every occasion.

22:10.112 --> 22:11.739
- That everything?
- Yeah.

22:11.780 --> 22:14.271
I can't believe I'm doing this.

22:14.316 --> 22:15.544
Me, too.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.052
Here's the number for
the poison control center.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.077
- Poison control?
- Do you need a list of poisons?

22:20.122 --> 22:21.987
No, I think most of them I know.

22:22.024 --> 22:24.686
I should have compiled a list
of commonly ingested poisons!

22:24.726 --> 22:27.058
I'm not going to poison our
children. They're in safe hands.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.528
- Have you ever been to a casino?
- No.

22:28.563 --> 22:30.394
<i>- Have you ever seen the movie Casino?
- No.</i>

22:30.432 --> 22:33.458
OK, there are only pay phones
in the common room,

22:33.502 --> 22:35.129
so I will call you on your cell phone.

22:35.170 --> 22:36.933
- OK.
- And no baby-sitters.

22:36.972 --> 22:39.941
Please, Dan.
They've gone seven years without a dad.

22:39.975 --> 22:41.909
Promise me you will not
leave them with strangers.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.343
- No strangers. Check.
- Dan! Vicki!

22:44.379 --> 22:48.076
<i>The kids have never seen
Friday the 13th, part one or two!</i>

22:48.116 --> 22:50.107
- Oh, my God!
- He's kidding. He's a kidder.

22:50.152 --> 22:52.177
<i>He was scared of
The Wizard of Oz. He's kidding.</i>

22:52.220 --> 22:53.744
The monkeys got him nuts.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.088
- Oh, and one more thing.
- I'm up for it.

22:57.125 --> 23:01.152
Well, Emily has kind of concocted
this idea that you're a superhero.

23:01.196 --> 23:02.754
Oh. Why?

23:02.798 --> 23:06.029
Well, it was her way of
explaining where you were,

23:06.068 --> 23:07.831
and it seemed harmless enough to me.

23:07.869 --> 23:10.565
- What are my powers?
- You can stop bullets and you can fly.

23:10.605 --> 23:13.233
- Bulletproof and flying.
- One... Two... Three!

23:13.275 --> 23:14.708
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

23:14.743 --> 23:16.438
- Oh, gosh, I gotta go.
- OK.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.807
I'm going to miss them so much.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.339
OK...

23:22.117 --> 23:23.880
Promise me...

23:23.919 --> 23:27.980
You will devote every ounce of
your being to taking care of them, Dan.

23:28.023 --> 23:29.320
I promise.

23:29.357 --> 23:31.791
- Promise me.
- I promise.

23:34.029 --> 23:37.556
- So, you're not a superhero?
- Not at the present time.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.864
Want to pick up the pace, Chachi?
We just got passed by a street sweeper.

23:41.903 --> 23:43.666
How about putting it in drive, grandma?

23:43.705 --> 23:46.833
There are babies on board!
Excuse me, kids.

23:55.884 --> 23:58.352
Ooh... Who's up for
chocolate chip pancakes?

23:58.386 --> 24:00.946
- Me! Me!
- No chocolate chips for breakfast.

24:00.989 --> 24:03.549
- Why not?
- Kids crave limits. It's in the books.

24:03.592 --> 24:07.028
Hey everybody, let's kick this off
with some really healthy choices.

24:07.062 --> 24:08.495
How about the heartland granola?

24:08.530 --> 24:11.021
That's like nature's broom!
That's kind of wonderful.

24:11.066 --> 24:13.159
Hey! Whoa!

24:13.201 --> 24:15.635
- Sorry.
- It's OK, Zach.

24:15.670 --> 24:17.501
- Here you go.
- It's an accident.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.700
That kind of thing happens.
You have nothing to worry about.

24:19.741 --> 24:21.936
- Hi there. How are you?
- Hi.

24:21.977 --> 24:24.605
- Good.
- Well, hello.

24:24.646 --> 24:27.342
- What's your name?
- Rochelle.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.374
Oh, Rochelle.

24:30.418 --> 24:33.751
Well, I didn't know they could
afford to hire supermodels here.

24:35.090 --> 24:38.253
Hey, Pops?
Isn't being a grandparent the best?

24:38.293 --> 24:40.090
I'm not a grandparent.

24:40.128 --> 24:43.928
My grandkids call me "Nub-Nub."
What do your grandkids call you?

24:43.965 --> 24:45.091
Nub-Nub's good.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.225
<i>Attention, Pamela's diners.</i>

24:46.268 --> 24:49.465
We've just been informed we have two
new members to the grandparents' club.

24:52.974 --> 24:56.137
<i>¶ Hey! Seniors, seniors, seniors!
Enjoy the grand buffet!</i>

24:56.178 --> 24:58.942
<i>¶ Seniors, seniors, seniors!
We hope you're here to stay!</i>

24:58.980 --> 25:01.778
<i>¶ Seniors, seniors, seniors!
We like to make a fuss!</i>

25:01.816 --> 25:05.308
<i>¶ Seniors, seniors, seniors,
every tenth meal is</i>

25:05.353 --> 25:09.380
<i>¶ On us!</i>

25:09.424 --> 25:11.858
<i>- ¶ Seniors, seniors, seniors...
- I'll be right back.</i>

25:13.195 --> 25:17.598
Rochelle, Rochelle... I don't know
what happened back there.

25:17.632 --> 25:19.463
Just a little too much
excitement for me.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.129
Oh, no.

25:22.170 --> 25:24.900
Oh, no, no.
This is just an accident.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.238
Don't worry. It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.368
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I'll get you something.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.777
It's a glass of water, that's all.

25:32.814 --> 25:34.839
One glass of water
gets my pump going, too.

25:34.883 --> 25:37.044
Uh-huh. Uh...

25:38.520 --> 25:40.920
Also, please tell them
we are very focused

25:40.956 --> 25:43.481
on the golf game with Mr. Nishamura.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.858
Write that on your resume?
"Oh, I pop bubble paper."

25:47.896 --> 25:51.332
- Would you handle them?
- We want to Xerox our butts.

25:51.366 --> 25:53.425
Will you excuse me for one moment?

25:53.468 --> 25:55.595
Get off there. I'm sorry, Dan.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.764
- What are you, a frat boy?
- I got your phone.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.206
- Timeout.
- Ah! Timeout.

26:00.242 --> 26:02.540
- Give that back! Yes.
- Keep-away? Are we doing this?

26:02.577 --> 26:05.205
Toss it to me, Emily!
Toss it to me!

26:06.081 --> 26:09.209
Your Japanese is so terrific.

26:09.251 --> 26:10.843
- You speak Japanese?
- Well, no.

26:10.885 --> 26:13.149
But I don't have to speak Japanese

26:13.188 --> 26:16.214
to see how beautiful
you are when you speak it.

26:16.258 --> 26:19.386
Don't go out there! Don't go out there!
Come back this way.

26:19.427 --> 26:23.386
- Yeah, I'm their favorite uncle.
- How old are they?

26:25.133 --> 26:28.159
- How old do you think they are?
- Um...

26:29.471 --> 26:33.840
- Seven?
- Seven! Yeah. You're good.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.809
- Fraternal twins?
- Is there any other kind?

26:39.447 --> 26:42.211
Oh, jeez. When you're around
kids as much as I am,

26:42.250 --> 26:44.582
you got to develop a sense of humor.

26:44.619 --> 26:47.179
- But it's rewarding, too.
- Hmm...

26:47.956 --> 26:50.083
Do you like the beach,
"favorite uncle" Charlie?

26:50.125 --> 26:51.149
Love!

26:52.460 --> 26:54.587
Why don't you come
to Westport on Saturday.

26:54.629 --> 26:56.324
I'm going to meet some friends
at their beach house.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.991
You can even bring
your niece and nephew.

26:58.033 --> 27:01.366
Well, I just may do that,
"beautiful translator" Amanda.

27:04.005 --> 27:06.337
Go camping,
learn how to ride a two-wheeler,

27:06.374 --> 27:10.435
my first pro baseball game,
refinish a deck and surfing.

27:10.478 --> 27:12.036
That's my Dad List.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.016
That sounds great.
Pull up your hoods, OK?

27:16.051 --> 27:19.282
- Put these on, all right?
- Why?

27:19.321 --> 27:22.085
Technically, you're not supposed
to be here, let alone living here.

27:22.123 --> 27:24.284
But we're going to have
a lot of fun. Let's go.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.428
Dan?

27:32.467 --> 27:34.662
Ooh! Betty. Hide! Go, go!

27:34.703 --> 27:36.728
- Dan, is that you?
- Hey, Betty!

27:36.771 --> 27:40.605
- Hi! You are looking good.
- You, too, baby.

27:40.642 --> 27:43.440
What's all that racket?

27:43.478 --> 27:45.844
I don't know. Maybe immigrants.
I'm not sure.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.279
Raccoons, most likely.

27:47.315 --> 27:49.545
No... Oh, my God, I see kids!

27:49.584 --> 27:51.745
- No, these are my...
- I see kids!

27:55.423 --> 27:58.256
Why don't you put them in a hotel?
They would love room service.

27:58.293 --> 28:00.955
They'd also love a spa,
but we can't... Don't run! Careful!

28:00.995 --> 28:03.896
- Don't touch that!
- Easy. Slow down! No running!

28:03.932 --> 28:05.991
Watch out! A lot of expensive things...

28:06.034 --> 28:07.695
- Are you out of your mind?
- Why?

28:07.736 --> 28:08.794
Come on!

28:08.837 --> 28:11.101
Listen. You're the one
that forced me into that place.

28:11.139 --> 28:14.506
- I cajoled you, I cajoled you.
- Don't give me semantics.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.271
Look, they're going upstairs now!

28:17.879 --> 28:20.814
This is my crib, man!
This is where I get down.

28:20.849 --> 28:24.307
This is where I sink the three points.
This is where I throw the TD.

28:24.352 --> 28:26.547
This isn't for kids, man.

28:26.588 --> 28:29.853
Look, that pool out there,
that's got a 15-foot deep end.

28:29.891 --> 28:33.292
Look at this place! I got
pointy-edged furniture. I got...

28:33.328 --> 28:35.262
Those spears probably
still have poison on them.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.093
You don't want them in this house.

28:37.132 --> 28:42.468
I do not lead a child-safe life, man!

28:42.504 --> 28:44.768
It is not... not how I roll. You know?

28:44.806 --> 28:46.671
Charlie...

28:46.708 --> 28:49.199
- I'm barely treading water here.
- Aw, don't...

28:49.244 --> 28:51.769
I don't know these kids very long,
but I'm still their dad.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.806
And they need a home. And so do I.

28:55.850 --> 28:58.148
Right now,
you're the closest thing we got.

29:05.260 --> 29:07.319
Thanks, bro. You're the best.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.693
OK. You went emotional and it paid off.

29:11.733 --> 29:13.667
- Good.
- This time.

29:13.701 --> 29:15.032
OK.

29:17.939 --> 29:20.999
Oh, it's Vicki! Kids!

29:21.042 --> 29:24.170
Well, first everybody thought
Dad was our grandpa.

29:24.212 --> 29:27.841
<i>Then he pretty much worked
the rest of the day.</i>

29:27.882 --> 29:30.976
"Everything is fine."

29:31.019 --> 29:34.648
And he did say he was going to do
the first thing on Zach's Dad List.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.817
That sounds promising. See?
This is gonna be great.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.053
Here's Dad.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.521
Hey, Vic. Didn't she sound wonderful?

29:42.564 --> 29:44.896
<i>- How's everything going?
- I'm OK.</i>

29:44.933 --> 29:47.265
Don't you worry a moment
about how things are going here

29:47.302 --> 29:49.634
because everything's going great.

29:51.506 --> 29:55.033
OK, you guys... lights out.

29:56.211 --> 29:57.610
OK.

29:57.645 --> 30:00.205
Alrighty. There you go.

30:00.248 --> 30:03.274
- You have your creature? Good.
- I do.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.954
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

30:09.157 --> 30:10.419
Good night.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.942
I just shook my daughter's hand
good night.

30:41.856 --> 30:43.585
I'm no good at this, Charlie.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.753
Come on. You're trying.
That's what matters.

30:46.794 --> 30:47.818
Thanks.

30:53.401 --> 30:55.198
They are cute, though.

30:55.236 --> 31:00.435
Yeah. They are when they're
in a... dormant configuration.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.845
Whoo-wee! Look at this, Nick!

31:21.296 --> 31:24.424
- Ready for the other one?
- Don't get drill happy.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.194
No, no, no. It's all good.

31:26.234 --> 31:28.134
Hey!

31:30.171 --> 31:32.935
- What are you doing?
- Sir, it's cool.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.943
That's Nick and I'm Gary.
We're the childproofers.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.343
- Really?
- I'm going to need access

31:38.379 --> 31:40.939
to all your personal drawers and stuff.

31:40.982 --> 31:45.510
- Dan! Dan! Did you do this?
- Charlie!

31:45.553 --> 31:47.180
- Oh, yeah.
- Did you bring them in?

31:47.221 --> 31:48.654
- Definitely.
- Why?

31:48.690 --> 31:51.022
You described this house as being
a dangerous place for kids,

31:51.059 --> 31:52.993
so I hired the best
childproofers there are.

31:53.027 --> 31:56.224
The tall guy over there,
he was a civil engineer.

31:56.264 --> 31:58.755
What kind of a civil engineer
would be baby-proofing a house?

32:02.270 --> 32:05.467
Failed one, sir,
I'm a failed civil engineer.

32:05.506 --> 32:09.499
I got a lot of bad road
behind me. Lot of potholes.

32:09.544 --> 32:12.638
That's why I'm going to be extra
vigilant in protecting your children.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.477
They're seven. And they're his kids.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.312
- That's true.
- That's progressive,

32:16.351 --> 32:18.046
- and I'm all for it.
- Oh, come on!

32:18.086 --> 32:21.988
Even I know you do not baby-proof
a house for seven-year-olds.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.184
- Oh!
- What about the 15-foot deep end?

32:24.225 --> 32:26.750
Sir, you got a flamethrower
for a fireplace.

32:26.794 --> 32:29.228
- It's a fashion. It's a style.
- The spears?

32:29.263 --> 32:31.060
What guy buys poison-tipped spears?

32:31.099 --> 32:34.193
A thousand years ago they were poison.
I don't know if they're poison now.

32:34.235 --> 32:36.066
You bought those a thousand years ago?

32:36.104 --> 32:39.369
- Expect me to believe that?
- You designed this house of horrors.

32:39.407 --> 32:42.570
You brought the kids to this house.
Stop it! Don't eat that.

32:42.610 --> 32:44.077
Those are dog treats.

32:44.112 --> 32:48.242
Everything tastes like dog food
after that smoked salmon I just had.

32:48.282 --> 32:49.476
You ate the salmon?

32:51.052 --> 32:54.988
- That was a gift.
- Yes, it was.

32:57.692 --> 33:00.126
- You guys better pack.
- Pack?

33:00.161 --> 33:02.322
- Why are you dressed like that?
- What do we pack for?

33:02.363 --> 33:04.627
Camping.
That's first on my Dad List.

33:04.666 --> 33:07.999
And we're Pioneers, so you
have to find the nearest campground.

33:08.036 --> 33:11.199
We have 50 files of Nishamura
work to do before Saturday.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.402
Guys, camping...
I don't think we can do it.

33:14.442 --> 33:16.774
- But you promised!
- I know I promised,

33:16.811 --> 33:21.009
but I didn't realize camping involved a
camping trip, and we have to reschedule.

33:21.049 --> 33:23.415
- But you promised.
- Sometimes promises

33:23.451 --> 33:26.818
- aren't written in stone.
- But you promised!

33:46.507 --> 33:51.103
We've been a Pioneer family
for four generations now.

33:51.145 --> 33:55.241
I practically grew up in these woods
following Grandpa Ted.

33:55.283 --> 33:58.446
Gramps was troop leader 63 years ago,

33:58.486 --> 34:02.513
and was the recipient of the
supreme Pioneer honor.

34:02.557 --> 34:05.355
Interred for eternity...

34:08.663 --> 34:12.565
...in a tomb erected with his own hands,

34:12.600 --> 34:15.569
right here on this...
on this very campsite.

34:20.742 --> 34:22.539
Not in front of the kids.

34:22.577 --> 34:26.069
Hey. Hey. Psst.

34:26.114 --> 34:30.777
Hey! You remind me of that
old dude who stole my girlfriend.

34:30.818 --> 34:33.946
- What?
- I promised myself...

34:33.987 --> 34:36.149
Yeah, you. You! Mr. Wall-of-Hair.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.784
Rick, you're a counselor here.
This is sacred ground.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.454
- Something I got to tell you.
- The Pioneers have meant

34:41.496 --> 34:46.956
the world to the Taylor clan.
That's who I am.

34:47.001 --> 34:50.902
Troop leader. Patriot. TSA supervisor.

34:50.938 --> 34:54.737
And dad. I am Barry Taylor.

34:58.412 --> 35:02.542
Gentlemen, why don't we
put down the electronic devices,

35:02.583 --> 35:04.676
and try to get into it a little bit?

35:04.719 --> 35:10.658
Hmm? After all...
we're here for the kids.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.182
Fine.

35:13.227 --> 35:16.321
Sorry.

35:21.936 --> 35:23.733
Here for the kids?
What's he talking about?

35:23.771 --> 35:26.035
OK, kids. Who wants to have some fun?

35:26.073 --> 35:27.836
Yeah!

35:27.875 --> 35:31.003
Let's go dig a hole.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.343
- What's your problem?
- How about we go dig a hole.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.110
He's giving me the stink eye.

35:35.149 --> 35:39.017
You thief. I loved her.
I loved her so much.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.021
- What are you saying?
- My beef is not with you, old woman.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.387
Thank you.

35:43.424 --> 35:47.258
- OK, now I got it.
- He has a lot.

35:51.132 --> 35:54.624
Hey, Zach, Emily.
Why don't you get your grandpa

35:54.669 --> 35:56.432
to leave the office...

35:56.470 --> 35:58.438
...and come over here
and join us in the woods?

35:58.472 --> 36:00.804
He's not our grandpa, he's our dad.

36:05.580 --> 36:11.143
Sure, Zach. My grandpa
was like a dad to me, too.

36:11.185 --> 36:15.451
He is, Troop Master Barry.
He's my dad, and that's his partner.

36:15.489 --> 36:18.322
- It's like we have two dads!
- Just found out.

36:18.359 --> 36:20.327
Trust me. It was a surprise.

36:20.828 --> 36:22.955
- Been together 30 years.
- Feels like 50.

36:24.398 --> 36:27.026
- Oh, well...
- We're soul mates, really.

36:27.068 --> 36:29.969
You must have a best buddy.

36:30.004 --> 36:32.097
Yeah. A pal?
Someone you can...

36:33.140 --> 36:35.040
- Fine.
- Take care.

36:35.076 --> 36:36.634
- Loner.
- Loner.

36:36.677 --> 36:38.201
- Loser!
- Loser.

36:40.047 --> 36:42.709
- No bears allowed.
- Thank you, Troop Master Barry.

36:42.750 --> 36:46.049
- Thanks.
- No trouble at all, kids.

36:46.087 --> 36:48.453
You ladies ready to play
a little Ultimate Frisbee?

36:48.489 --> 36:51.287
- I think so, Mr. Testosterone.
- Yeah.

36:51.325 --> 36:53.350
Ultimate Frisbee?
That's our game.

36:53.394 --> 36:57.455
- Let's do this for our kids, huh?
- Yeah!

36:57.498 --> 37:00.524
Come on, man. Let's do it.
Yeah, for the kids. Yeah, baby.

37:00.568 --> 37:02.627
All right, let's do this.
Sports marketing!

37:02.670 --> 37:05.537
Sports marketing! Yeah!
Make the deal. Get them!

37:06.774 --> 37:10.733
- That's bear scat, gentlemen.
- Yeah... Yeah, it is.

37:11.779 --> 37:13.371
- Dad?
- Yeah?

37:13.414 --> 37:15.006
I think "scat" is poop.

37:16.017 --> 37:18.178
- Really, son?
- Yeah.

37:18.219 --> 37:21.188
- You wiped poop on my face?
- Yeah.

37:22.189 --> 37:23.986
Scat happens, man.

37:37.204 --> 37:40.867
One, two, three, four,

37:40.908 --> 37:44.366
five, six, seven, eight...

37:54.422 --> 37:57.653
Aah...

38:05.599 --> 38:07.863
Go long!

38:13.607 --> 38:17.771
Yes! Yeah, baby!

38:17.812 --> 38:19.507
Barry! I'm over here, I'm open!

38:23.050 --> 38:25.382
- Hey!
- I'm open!

38:28.656 --> 38:30.453
- Oh!
- Get...

38:34.161 --> 38:40.122
- Sorry.
- Ow, my gums!

38:41.836 --> 38:44.236
You get your wingman to fight
your battles for you?

38:44.271 --> 38:46.796
- I didn't take your woman.
- I'm a man.

38:46.841 --> 38:49.969
- I don't know your woman!
- First you steal Janice Applebaum.

38:50.011 --> 38:52.571
- You're confused!
- Then you steal my soul.

38:52.613 --> 38:56.049
- What?
- Now it's on, smiley.

38:56.083 --> 38:58.643
Prison rules!

38:59.420 --> 39:02.548
- Prison rules?
- Oh, boy.

39:06.794 --> 39:09.888
Whoo!

39:09.930 --> 39:12.797
Come on, Dad. You can get up.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.430
Never mind.

39:18.873 --> 39:20.238
Back, back, back, back.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.400
Time out.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.343
Ah!

39:26.414 --> 39:27.608
Get off of me!

39:35.523 --> 39:38.583
Stay down, gentle warrior.

39:38.626 --> 39:41.390
Ooh...

39:44.832 --> 39:47.392
Pull.

39:50.471 --> 39:52.962
- Textbook double bull's eye.
- Nice, Barry.

39:54.141 --> 39:59.010
That's how you get yourself a chest
full of merit patches. Anyone else?

39:59.613 --> 40:01.205
Pull!

40:03.250 --> 40:06.651
- Barry...
- I said... pull!

40:17.498 --> 40:19.125
My bad!

40:19.166 --> 40:22.658
No!

40:23.571 --> 40:26.904
- Grandpa Ted!
- We should get our merit patches

40:26.941 --> 40:30.775
- just for being his kids.
- Sorry! How bad is it?

40:30.811 --> 40:32.745
- Bad!
- OK.

40:43.924 --> 40:47.052
As a result of your
little outdoor adventure,

40:47.094 --> 40:50.359
I just want you to know
that my sciatica has flared up,

40:50.397 --> 40:51.830
and I stink like a steakhouse.

40:51.866 --> 40:53.356
- So thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.765
Don't mind the fact that I took

40:54.802 --> 40:57.032
a three-day camping trip
and shortened it to nine hours.

40:57.071 --> 41:00.700
- I made fire! Wow!
- Oh, no!

41:01.175 --> 41:03.905
That's not good. Get the car ready.

41:03.944 --> 41:07.277
Little collateral damage,
but we're back on track with the deal.

41:07.314 --> 41:10.340
Now it's all about the golf game.
How's your back?

41:10.384 --> 41:12.249
- Tight.
- Untighten it.

41:12.286 --> 41:15.312
Because Nishamura uses golf
as a metaphor for life.

41:15.356 --> 41:18.257
<i>So if you mess that up,
it's sayonara, Nishamura.</i>

41:19.126 --> 41:23.085
- One of my little magic pills.
- My housekeeper happens to

41:23.130 --> 41:25.997
arrange them in an organized
circular fashion, like so.

41:26.033 --> 41:27.864
<i>- Pardon-moi.
- Yes.</i>

41:27.902 --> 41:30.700
That's amazing.
When did we become our fathers?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.535
Man, I'd like to see Troop Leader Barry

41:32.573 --> 41:34.564
deal with the side effects
of even one of these puppies.

41:34.608 --> 41:37.042
Look at this. For my aging prostate.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.772
- Right.
- Side effects include

41:38.812 --> 41:42.248
swollen tongue, dry mouth
and pus-filled canker sores.

41:42.283 --> 41:44.717
- Come on.
- This is a joint anti-inflammatory.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.983
Maximum dosage may cause bouts
of uncontrollable appetite.

41:48.022 --> 41:50.286
That's not so bad. The munchies.
I could deal with that.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.224
Look at this one. High blood pressure.

41:52.259 --> 41:55.057
"Watch out for sudden loss
of depth perception."

41:55.095 --> 41:58.189
This tiny pill lowers
your bad cholesterol.

41:58.232 --> 42:01.201
But the first time I took it,
partial facial paralysis.

42:01.235 --> 42:03.897
- Come on.
- I froze up like a circus clown.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.132
- I was, like, "Ha."
- You're kidding.

42:05.172 --> 42:06.571
Yeah, like...

42:07.608 --> 42:10.441
- Threw my back out.
- Man...

42:12.379 --> 42:14.973
- How much longer we got?
- One week, four days, nine hours.

42:15.015 --> 42:19.111
- Mmm... Good Lord.
- God help us all.

42:21.021 --> 42:23.649
Hey, Dad, I'm in
desperate need of a King Fontana.

42:23.691 --> 42:25.556
- You want to play?
- My doctor says that

42:25.593 --> 42:28.084
I can't get down on the floor,
even crouch, on a golf day.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.961
It seems I have a genetic
predisposition to knee problems.

42:30.998 --> 42:34.024
That means you have it, too.
So you have to be very careful.

42:34.068 --> 42:35.626
Nick, I told you not to use epoxy.

42:35.669 --> 42:38.160
It's going to leave a
permanent stain and an odor.

42:38.205 --> 42:41.333
Why can't you ever
tell me I did a good job?

42:41.375 --> 42:43.343
<i>All right, maestro, how do I do this?</i>

42:43.377 --> 42:48.041
Um, OK... You want to go
quarter turn clockwise,

42:48.082 --> 42:51.540
grab the lever, then use the
counter lever to spin 180 degrees...

42:51.585 --> 42:53.883
Why are you
charging that in here?

42:53.921 --> 42:57.789
I keep getting in Dad's way.
He can't do any business in here, right?

42:57.825 --> 43:00.385
<i>Release like that, and voilà.</i>

43:03.497 --> 43:05.727
Check if they
have kids' toothpaste.

43:05.766 --> 43:08.064
That old people stuff burns my...

43:11.005 --> 43:14.941
- Should we tell?
- I think I remember where they go.

43:15.909 --> 43:17.877
We'll put this one in...

43:17.911 --> 43:21.005
- This one in here.
- Put them in here.

43:34.728 --> 43:36.889
Ooh... Mmm.

43:55.683 --> 43:57.275
What am I doing? They're guys.

44:03.257 --> 44:06.693
OK, guys, let's go!
Are you guys still hungry?

44:06.727 --> 44:08.718
- We just ate.
- So did you.

44:08.762 --> 44:10.457
I know, but I'm starved.

44:23.577 --> 44:25.408
That's weird. Hmm.

44:25.979 --> 44:28.243
Do you have candy bars on you?
Don't lie to me.

44:28.282 --> 44:30.113
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

44:30.150 --> 44:32.641
- Hey!
- Hey! You made it.

44:32.686 --> 44:35.211
- We made it. Yeah.
- Can we go play?

44:35.255 --> 44:37.780
Go ahead. There's games
over there. Check it out.

44:38.525 --> 44:40.117
Catch you later.

44:44.898 --> 44:48.493
- Oh!
- Wow. You got a lot of friends.

44:48.535 --> 44:50.935
Oh, well, they're not
actually all my friends.

44:50.971 --> 44:52.836
It's a bereavement group I belong to.

44:52.873 --> 44:54.363
- Bereavement?
- Yeah.

44:54.408 --> 44:56.433
My grandma passed away six months ago.

44:56.477 --> 44:58.877
- I'm sorry.
- Everyone here is dealing with loss.

44:58.912 --> 45:00.880
And then on the weekends
we have a potluck.

45:01.882 --> 45:03.713
Potluck? Where?

45:04.918 --> 45:07.113
Mr. Nishamura. It's an honor.

45:10.090 --> 45:12.115
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.784
Oh.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.861
- My son, Riku.
- Riku.

45:17.898 --> 45:20.958
- Yeah, hey. Hey. Hey...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

45:21.468 --> 45:22.958
Oh!

45:26.907 --> 45:29.933
Thank you.

45:35.015 --> 45:37.142
Tongue is swollen.

45:37.751 --> 45:42.779
We are dedicating lunch today
to our brave Justine,

45:42.823 --> 45:46.281
who passed away just two days ago.

45:46.326 --> 45:49.887
Voicemail. No! Charlie, it's me.

45:49.930 --> 45:52.455
I think we switch peers.

45:52.499 --> 45:54.023
I love cupcakes!

45:54.067 --> 45:59.130
She left us a gift of one of her
world-famous rhubarb pies,

45:59.173 --> 46:04.702
that she baked through her pain
of the last few hours of her life.

46:04.745 --> 46:09.944
- Good mercy!
- No talk. Nishamura. Call me.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.778
Are you ready?

46:17.391 --> 46:19.985
That's Justine's rhubarb pie!

46:20.027 --> 46:23.258
Where is she?
I want to give Justine a big hug.

46:23.297 --> 46:27.666
- She's dead.
- My condolences.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.135
She's dead!

46:33.874 --> 46:38.311
She's dead! She's dead!
Give me it! Dead! She's dead!

46:38.345 --> 46:40.404
That's a close second.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.946
Ooh... Ah!

46:49.890 --> 46:52.415
- Is my face twitching?
- You look great.

46:52.459 --> 46:55.053
You look... great.

46:55.095 --> 46:57.256
Charlie? Are you OK?

46:57.297 --> 47:00.130
I am so sorry about
that whole pie thing.

47:00.167 --> 47:02.635
It must be my blood sugar or something.

47:02.669 --> 47:05.001
It's OK. I think I calmed them down.

47:05.038 --> 47:06.733
Come on. We're having circle time.

47:06.773 --> 47:09.503
- Circle time?
- It's when the whole group

47:09.543 --> 47:11.135
gathers and shares their grief.

47:11.178 --> 47:15.842
Oh... Guys, I'll be back.
I got to go to circle time.

47:22.222 --> 47:24.782
- Um... Hey, Dan?
- Hmm?

47:24.825 --> 47:29.626
How are you doing? I recently put down
$3,000 on an authentic Japanese kimono.

47:32.633 --> 47:34.260
I just want to make sure it goes OK.

47:47.814 --> 47:51.306
Aah... Aah...

47:57.624 --> 48:03.028
Dan-san, would you like to use my club?

48:05.032 --> 48:07.091
Is that a "yes"?

48:07.134 --> 48:10.467
- Why is he ignoring my father?
- No, he's just really intense.

48:10.504 --> 48:15.635
He excludes all but the game.
A focus you could learn, my son.

48:25.352 --> 48:28.287
- Ooh...
- I knew it. Oh, gosh.

48:28.322 --> 48:32.383
Breathe. Just breathe through it.
Walk it off. Walk it off.

48:32.426 --> 48:34.053
We're good. We're good.
Just take a shot.

48:34.094 --> 48:36.654
It just passes, and then...
And then it comes back.

48:36.697 --> 48:41.498
After nine months of excruciating pain,

48:41.535 --> 48:46.598
- the cancer had spread.
- We're all here for you.

48:50.944 --> 48:54.641
- Do you think this is funny?
- He thinks it's funny.

48:54.681 --> 48:56.546
Everybody grieves in their own way.

48:56.583 --> 48:58.778
- That's true.
- If I don't laugh, I'll cry.

49:14.534 --> 49:17.435
The golf gods look favorably upon you.

49:17.471 --> 49:21.032
This is a very good omen.

49:32.285 --> 49:34.048
That was some delicious pie.

49:49.670 --> 49:52.070
Dan, have you
seen the Nishamura file?

49:52.105 --> 49:55.199
Hey Dad, maybe tomorrow you can
teach me how to ride a two-wheel.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.937
I got a lot on my mind right now.

49:56.977 --> 49:59.138
I'm trying to focus,
finish this business deal.

49:59.179 --> 50:01.477
Come on, Dad. You're not even trying.

50:01.515 --> 50:06.452
I'm struggling, OK? That's like trying,
it just... without succeeding.

50:14.528 --> 50:17.019
Oh, come on.
He unplugged the fax machine.

50:17.064 --> 50:19.760
Two open plugs and he has
to unplug the fax machine

50:19.800 --> 50:22.769
- to plug in his little gaming system.
- Big deal. Come on.

50:22.803 --> 50:25.237
You can't run a business
if you can't get faxes on time.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.331
This is the reason
I didn't want to have kids.

50:31.078 --> 50:32.943
I wasn't talking about you, Zach.

50:36.750 --> 50:38.274
Hey, Zach.

50:39.219 --> 50:42.484
Hey, Zach. Zach...

50:43.690 --> 50:45.715
Zachary!

50:59.272 --> 51:03.208
I defaced a venerated monument,
literally. Burned down a campground.

51:03.243 --> 51:06.406
My son, for all intents and
purposes, is giving up on me.

51:06.446 --> 51:08.573
I'm failing them everywhere I look.

51:08.615 --> 51:12.073
Emily, one minute she
wants me to be a superhero,

51:12.119 --> 51:15.953
- the next minute a lion, then a king.
- Then be a king, you idiot!

51:15.989 --> 51:19.049
Be a superhero, be a lion,
be whatever she wants.

51:20.627 --> 51:23.755
Don't you get it? She just
wants someone to protect her.

51:25.265 --> 51:27.460
- That's it?
- Yes.

51:27.501 --> 51:30.197
You have to be on their level.
Be like them.

51:30.237 --> 51:32.637
You know what my dad gave me
for my fifth birthday?

51:32.672 --> 51:35.106
- What?
- A calculator.

51:36.409 --> 51:39.401
I don't know what it is about me

51:39.446 --> 51:43.542
that sees you in a crisis and then
comes galloping to your rescue.

51:43.583 --> 51:45.847
But I guess I am who I am, aren't I?

51:48.121 --> 51:50.681
You need help connecting
with these kids?

51:50.724 --> 51:52.282
I'm going to find you help.

51:56.763 --> 52:00.494
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

52:25.559 --> 52:26.890
- Whoo!
- Rocked it, baby.

52:26.927 --> 52:28.952
Ladies, beautiful as always.

52:28.995 --> 52:30.929
- Jimmy Mac!
- Charlie!

52:30.964 --> 52:33.296
- Yeah, brother!
- What's up? Charlie, look at you!

52:33.333 --> 52:34.630
- Meet my friend, Dan.
- Hey.

52:34.668 --> 52:37.330
Tell me you felt it.
Did you feel it, man?

52:37.370 --> 52:38.997
- Was it electrifying?
- Electrifying.

52:39.039 --> 52:40.404
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

52:40.440 --> 52:43.102
Like chocolate milk coming
through the nose, baby! Yeah!

52:43.143 --> 52:45.703
Two shows tomorrow, everybody.
So what's going on?

52:45.745 --> 52:47.212
- I was gonna ask you a favor.
- What you need?

52:47.247 --> 52:49.477
Remember at Wade's party
you were talking about

52:49.516 --> 52:52.883
a human puppeteer, this mechanism?
You got that done?

52:52.919 --> 52:55.149
When I was talking to you in confidence?

52:55.188 --> 52:58.089
- Yeah.
- You always had that problem.

52:58.124 --> 53:01.218
This man is in trouble. He has trouble
relating to his own children.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.853
- Oh, my God.
- He needs your help.

53:02.896 --> 53:04.625
With your technology, we can fix this.

53:04.664 --> 53:06.131
- Oh, thank you.
- It's true.

53:06.166 --> 53:08.726
Let me get this right.
You want to hire me

53:08.768 --> 53:11.134
to take this uptight man
and make him a human puppet?

53:11.171 --> 53:13.639
- Yes.
- I'm gonna do it for you.

53:13.673 --> 53:16.642
- Aah!
- Everybody, chop, chop! Whoo!

53:16.676 --> 53:20.476
- I feel so doggone good here.
- All right. We're good to go.

53:20.513 --> 53:22.913
Now, you told me that your
friend didn't know how to play.

53:22.949 --> 53:25.110
- It's true.
- Dan, now you don't have to.

53:25.151 --> 53:27.745
- Charlie's going to play for you.
- With this suit?

53:27.787 --> 53:30.187
- Yes. Stick this down your pants.
- Why?

53:30.223 --> 53:34.023
That thing will emit such a jolt that it
will literally tickle your funny bone.

53:47.674 --> 53:50.108
This is a proper tea.

53:51.177 --> 53:54.340
Cup. Bring it up.

53:55.282 --> 53:56.374
Pinky.

53:57.117 --> 53:58.311
This is awesome.

53:58.351 --> 54:02.481
Oh, King Fontana,
I do so admire a proper gentleman.

54:02.522 --> 54:07.892
I admire proper gentlemen, too.
I admire them very, very much.

54:09.095 --> 54:11.689
What?

54:13.600 --> 54:16.467
That was a good cup of tea.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.961
Why, thank you. As princess of the land,
I have made it specially.

54:20.006 --> 54:23.567
- It is poo-poo flavored.
- She's cute.

54:23.610 --> 54:26.943
- He didn't laugh. Make him laugh.
- Watch this.

54:29.849 --> 54:34.047
Laugh, puppet. Laugh, laugh.

54:49.769 --> 54:53.398
"Here with my board. Have questions."

54:53.440 --> 54:56.341
Cool. I have my board, too.

55:12.726 --> 55:16.856
"Nissan has been our marketing partner
in racing for many years."

55:18.264 --> 55:22.758
"Nissan is poop."

55:32.045 --> 55:33.945
Ah, ah.

55:33.980 --> 55:39.577
Strong words. You suggest we sever ties?

55:39.619 --> 55:41.484
Racecars. Cool.

55:41.521 --> 55:45.150
"... but robots are cooler."

55:45.191 --> 55:48.456
How could he know we're exploring
a major push in that field?

55:55.468 --> 55:58.869
"This is boring. I'm leaving now."

56:00.507 --> 56:03.499
- Fearless, this one.
- Spin him.

56:03.543 --> 56:06.842
- Whoa!
- Spin him. Spin him again.

56:14.421 --> 56:16.480
- Too much spin.
- Yeah.

56:18.625 --> 56:19.683
I'm OK.

56:21.594 --> 56:24.791
I told your boy not to get the
battery pack wet. He's on his own.

56:25.598 --> 56:28.032
Sorry, Emily.

56:33.706 --> 56:35.640
Princess?

56:38.578 --> 56:40.409
King Fontana?

56:42.982 --> 56:45.416
Game on.

56:47.587 --> 56:49.418
At your service, my lady.

56:53.126 --> 56:55.390
You know when they found you
after so many years

56:55.428 --> 56:58.192
there were many in my kingdom
who were trepidatious.

56:58.231 --> 57:02.668
- Really hard word.
- Oh. People were scared.

57:02.702 --> 57:07.139
And even most regal I,
your king, was frightened.

57:07.173 --> 57:11.371
- A king who was scared? Ha!
- I know. 'T is to laugh. Ha...

57:11.411 --> 57:13.106
But 'tis true.

57:13.146 --> 57:16.604
'T is the reason why
a king may act like a toad.

57:17.717 --> 57:20.242
<i>But the day your king found you,</i>

57:20.286 --> 57:22.948
he vowed to protect you forever.

57:22.989 --> 57:27.153
Even though he didn't know you,
could barely speak your language,

57:27.193 --> 57:30.026
and yes, was a little afraid...

57:31.264 --> 57:36.896
...he vowed to vanquish any and all
who would do you harm in any way.

57:39.038 --> 57:41.006
You know that. Right, Emily?

57:42.475 --> 57:44.773
You know I'll always be there for you.

57:44.811 --> 57:50.272
You're my daughter,
and I will love you forever.

58:02.862 --> 58:05.330
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not. I'm not crying.

58:05.365 --> 58:11.201
Jimmy Mac, you crying?
Come on, Jimmy.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.102
Your humble servant, madam.

58:17.143 --> 58:19.668
- OK.
- Don't let go, Dad.

58:19.712 --> 58:22.476
<i>This reminds me of an article
I once read in Advertising Age,</i>

58:22.515 --> 58:26.451
which talked about the fact
that a loss in a firm's brand assets

58:26.486 --> 58:29.785
is negatively correlated
with increased market valuation.

58:29.822 --> 58:31.551
I don't know what
you're talking about, Dad.

58:31.591 --> 58:34.185
Let's talk about the fact that
you're riding a two-wheeler on your own.

58:34.227 --> 58:38.596
- No hands, baby! No hands!
- I'm doing it, Dad! I'm doing it!

58:38.631 --> 58:41.122
Yeah! You're doing it.

58:43.703 --> 58:45.671
Oh...

58:47.340 --> 58:48.864
Hit it!

58:51.044 --> 58:52.534
Rookies.

58:55.949 --> 58:57.940
There you go. That was awesome.

59:05.458 --> 59:07.983
Hey, look! Look! That's us!

59:08.494 --> 59:10.052
Yeah!

59:16.002 --> 59:19.995
<i>We were most impressed by your
knowledge of our assets base.</i>

59:20.039 --> 59:23.770
<i>But ultimately,
it was your robotics idea</i>

59:23.810 --> 59:26.244
<i>that pushed us over the top.</i>

59:26.279 --> 59:28.873
- Robotics?
- Smile and nod.

59:28.915 --> 59:33.511
<i>We here, at NMG, are ready
to go to the next step.</i>

59:33.553 --> 59:39.082
<i>Pack your bag, Craig-san.
You're moving to Tokyo.</i>

59:49.002 --> 59:52.563
I've worked so hard!
It's like I've just been traded!

59:52.605 --> 59:56.507
<i>- We'll translate that later.
- Come on over!</i>

59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.571
- He's very excited.
- Whoo!

01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:14.192
Remember, Thursday morning,

01:00:14.227 --> 01:00:16.422
conference call with
Nishamura and the board.

01:00:16.462 --> 01:00:18.555
You set things up,
and we'll take it from there.

01:00:18.598 --> 01:00:22.125
Got it. Conference call Thursday,
tee it up for the big guns.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.261
I just want to say thanks, you guys.

01:00:25.305 --> 01:00:28.672
Nobody's ever really believed
in me the way that you two have.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.768
And it really means a lot to me.
You guys are like...

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.514
You're like the two dads that I
never had. I really appreciate it.

01:00:38.084 --> 01:00:42.180
My two father figures.
I'm going to do you proud.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:45.850
- All right.
- Go To.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.917
- You don't want to be late.
- Whoo!

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.225
Look out, Japan. Here comes
some serious business.

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:05.142
Oh, God help us.

01:01:05.178 --> 01:01:08.238
It was so cool, Mom.
Dad taught me how to ride a two-wheeler,

01:01:08.281 --> 01:01:11.409
<i>and then we got to hang out
with the New York Mets!</i>

01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:14.750
Let me talk to her.
And Dad promised that he'd

01:01:14.787 --> 01:01:17.017
do something huge
for our birthday this year.

01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:18.751
But he won't even tell us what it is.

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:20.588
<i>- Let me say hi to him.
- OK.</i>

01:01:20.626 --> 01:01:23.754
Hey. I'm coming to get you tomorrow.
No arguments.

01:01:23.796 --> 01:01:25.923
Tomorrow morning, I have
the biggest conference call

01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:28.763
in my entire career,
but after that I'm all yours.

01:01:28.801 --> 01:01:32.168
It's amazing. I left the kids
with you out of desperation,

01:01:32.205 --> 01:01:34.696
but now I can't imagine
having done it differently.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:36.439
Me too.

01:02:26.058 --> 01:02:29.084
Oh, great. This is a record.

01:02:29.128 --> 01:02:32.723
He unplugged a laptop,
BlackBerry, lamp, an alarm cl...

01:02:34.734 --> 01:02:36.201
- Charlie!
- What?

01:02:36.235 --> 01:02:37.600
- What?!
- Conference call.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.337
- Let's go!
- No, no, no.

01:02:41.374 --> 01:02:43.274
- My notes!
- No time!

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:51.116
- In three, two, one...
- Kids! In the car!

01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:57.523
Just a second... Good...

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.417
Nishamura-san.

01:03:01.461 --> 01:03:04.055
Please accept our
sincere apology for the delay.

01:03:04.096 --> 01:03:07.395
<i>We trust our colleague, Craig,
has already begun the presentation.</i>

01:03:07.433 --> 01:03:10.334
<i>I'm afraid your colleague,
Craig, has not been</i>

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:13.429
<i>seen nor heard from
since the moment he arrived.</i>

01:03:13.473 --> 01:03:15.771
Really?

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:17.571
<i>He's just a little thing.</i>

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:20.238
<i>He looks more like a little
leprechaun in a business suit.</i>

01:03:20.279 --> 01:03:21.541
<i>- You can't miss him.
- Red hair...</i>

01:03:21.581 --> 01:03:24.982
<i>He called me from
the Ginza his first night,</i>

01:03:25.017 --> 01:03:29.113
<i>and all I heard was...</i>

01:03:29.155 --> 01:03:33.216
<i>Techno music... and something about
the teachings of a karaoke master.</i>

01:03:36.128 --> 01:03:38.289
<i>¶ Hey-hey</i>

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:41.300
Ai! Ai! Ai!

01:03:41.334 --> 01:03:43.859
<i>- Ah...
- Dan-san.</i>

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:48.602
<i>I have the utmost respect for you,
but an hour delay</i>

01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:52.941
<i>and a missing executive is not the way
to begin a relationship.</i>

01:03:52.979 --> 01:03:54.776
<i>We will do anything
to make it work out.</i>

01:03:54.814 --> 01:03:57.146
<i>We are there for you,
Nishamura-san, 24/7.</i>

01:03:57.183 --> 01:04:02.553
Good. That is what I hoped to hear.
So, if we are to move forward

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:07.218
you and Charlie are the ones
who must move here to Tokyo

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.524
<i>and be our liaison.</i>

01:04:09.562 --> 01:04:14.397
That is my final and only offer.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.806
OK... Let's do this.
Let's do this. Just do it.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:34.075
- Thank you. Oh!
- Hey.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.317
Oh! Freedom. I can smell the air again.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.522
- How are the kids?
- Great.

01:04:41.561 --> 01:04:43.529
- Maybe we should get going.
- OK.

01:04:45.164 --> 01:04:49.692
I just went with the motto, "Don't
serve the time, let the time serve you."

01:04:50.503 --> 01:04:54.837
The truth is, Dan, most of what
I was reflecting on was us.

01:04:54.874 --> 01:04:56.364
Really?

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:58.877
And the way you've proven yourself
to me with the kids.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:01.837
- Bless you.
- Our kids.

01:05:01.881 --> 01:05:06.215
- Yeah.
- Maybe you were right two weeks ago.

01:05:06.252 --> 01:05:08.379
Maybe it is time to give us another try.

01:05:10.222 --> 01:05:12.690
Really?

01:05:12.725 --> 01:05:14.420
Timing.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.189
- Timing's perfect.
- Timing.

01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:18.162
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.435
Where are they?

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:34.569
- Oh, my babies.
- Mom.

01:05:34.614 --> 01:05:37.811
Oh! I missed you so much.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.013
All right. I made you guys something.

01:05:41.053 --> 01:05:44.022
Cool!

01:05:44.056 --> 01:05:45.080
Thanks, Mom.

01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:47.251
Don't worry, Charlie.
I didn't forget you.

01:05:47.293 --> 01:05:50.592
I carved you a little soap bunny.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:52.097
Oh, Charlie.

01:05:52.131 --> 01:05:54.622
I'll strike that right off
my Christmas list.

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:58.194
Hey, that's a thoughtful gift.
That's wonderful.

01:05:59.538 --> 01:06:02.098
We need to discuss something,
though, as a family.

01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:04.666
- I'll give you a moment.
- OK.

01:06:12.284 --> 01:06:16.584
When you reappeared in my life, Charlie
and I were in the middle of a deal

01:06:16.622 --> 01:06:19.557
that could be the culmination
of our 30 years in this business.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:26.127
But in order to close that deal...
I have to move to Japan.

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:29.563
What about our birthday? The big party?

01:06:29.602 --> 01:06:32.036
I'm probably going to miss this one.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:35.302
But I'm going to try really hard
and come back every six months.

01:06:35.341 --> 01:06:37.935
So I'll make the next one
most likely, you know?

01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:41.405
What about what you said two weeks ago?

01:06:41.447 --> 01:06:43.779
What about trying to make us work?

01:06:43.816 --> 01:06:48.116
I meant that. I really did. But...

01:06:48.154 --> 01:06:52.284
But, Daddy, if you move to Japan,
who will protect the kingdom?

01:06:55.728 --> 01:06:58.356
I know you wanted me
to be a superhero, Emily.

01:06:58.397 --> 01:07:01.127
You all wanted me to be one.

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:03.863
But I'm not. I wish I could be.

01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:06.701
I'd fly back and forth
from Japan every day.

01:07:10.242 --> 01:07:12.369
I'm just a guy in marketing.

01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:19.510
I'm going to go pack the kids.

01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:23.448
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.338
- Hello. Thank you.
- May I take your bag?

01:07:40.372 --> 01:07:43.239
Why don't we think of
this deal as our child.

01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:45.743
- Uh-huh.
- Hello. Hi.

01:07:47.279 --> 01:07:50.373
I know you're upset about leaving,
but we're going to fix it, OK?

01:07:50.416 --> 01:07:53.078
We're going to find somebody
to replace Craig who's smarter,

01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:56.555
and in six months
to a year, we're home. OK?

01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:58.921
- You think?
- This time I just say to you,

01:07:58.958 --> 01:08:01.552
"Embrace it. People love Japan."

01:08:02.695 --> 01:08:04.686
- Want some?
- No!

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.324
- What? No?
- No. No. OK.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:21.410
<i>The truth is, I probably
looked like the Joker from Batman.</i>

01:08:21.447 --> 01:08:23.971
But I felt bad. These poor, sad people.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:27.076
Anyway, I'm the first guy
to insult a bereavement group

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:28.245
and still get the girl.

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:33.725
That's Yankee ingenuity!

01:08:34.126 --> 01:08:38.756
Please, Charlie, show us that
facial paralysis smile one more time.

01:08:46.906 --> 01:08:49.272
All right, do your thing, superstar.

01:08:49.308 --> 01:08:50.774
Thank you.

01:08:52.944 --> 01:08:55.345
The American sports market
is a minefield,

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.973
and what I'd like to do today

01:08:57.015 --> 01:09:01.953
is draw a map
through that minefield so that...

01:09:07.326 --> 01:09:09.920
OK, Dan. Let's get going.

01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:12.692
I accessed the wrong file.

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.665
<i>- Dad!
- Hey, Dad.</i>

01:09:16.468 --> 01:09:18.765
Um... A little technical...

01:09:22.608 --> 01:09:25.839
- I can do it from my notes.
- OK.

01:09:35.888 --> 01:09:39.255
The first market segment is, um...

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.184
Let's go.

01:09:44.162 --> 01:09:49.032
The idea of sports to a kid...

01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:53.904
Dan, what's going on?

01:09:56.242 --> 01:09:58.767
How could you have tanked that
meeting? The way I set you up,

01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:01.405
you could've told them we were hiring
monkeys and they would have bought it!

01:10:02.348 --> 01:10:03.838
That was our dream, Dan!

01:10:03.883 --> 01:10:07.341
That was going to put us in the hall
of fame of sports marketing.

01:10:07.386 --> 01:10:08.410
Go!

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.651
Remember that USFL account we got?
That would've been the one to tank!

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.625
- Will you please shut up?!
- Now you speak!

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.685
- You want a piece of me? Bring it!
- Bring it! Come on!

01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:19.323
All right! Sorry.

01:10:19.365 --> 01:10:21.196
How's this going to work out, snowball?

01:10:21.233 --> 01:10:23.929
I don't know, man tan. You'll be OK.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:27.837
You'll tap-dance your way into a
brand-new job, still date 35-year-olds.

01:10:27.873 --> 01:10:31.309
You never grew up.
You never had to. You always had me.

01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:35.878
- God!
- It is small enough!

01:10:35.915 --> 01:10:38.110
- Shut up, Charlie!
- Made for a sardine.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.210
- I'm a big man. This is a little seat.
- Yeah, you're a big ma...

01:10:41.253 --> 01:10:44.552
- Stop trying to change me, Charlie.
- You know I can't do that.

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:46.990
- Then I'm done.
- Done with taking my advice?

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:49.756
- Mmm-hmm.
- Late-night rap sessions?

01:10:49.795 --> 01:10:51.660
But not done
with the time-share in Vail.

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:53.892
No, I'm done with you.

01:10:53.933 --> 01:10:55.924
<i>Welcome aboard,
flight nine to New York.</i>

01:10:55.968 --> 01:10:58.129
<i>We got 18 hours
of flight time ahead of us,</i>

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:01.606
<i>so turn to the person next to you
and get to know them.</i>

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.471
<i>It's going to be a long ride.</i>

01:11:05.778 --> 01:11:07.245
Where you from?

01:11:09.581 --> 01:11:12.049
The whole trip was a bust
from start to finish.

01:11:12.451 --> 01:11:14.009
Amanda, could I call you back?

01:11:14.053 --> 01:11:17.887
I got to pick up Lucky
from the dog hotel. I'll call you.

01:11:19.091 --> 01:11:21.992
Where's my boy? Where's my boy?

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:26.259
Lucky, come here, boy.
Where's my goo-go!

01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:27.856
Where is he?

01:11:32.204 --> 01:11:35.230
- Where is he?
- We tried to call.

01:11:43.248 --> 01:11:45.648
<i>Hello, Daniel, it's Charlie.</i>

01:11:45.684 --> 01:11:49.415
<i>Thought you'd like to know that after
14 wonderful, fulfilling years together,</i>

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:52.219
<i>my true best friend, Lucky, has passed.</i>

01:11:52.257 --> 01:11:55.658
<i>Maybe my life isn't as blessed
as you paint it to be.</i>

01:11:55.694 --> 01:11:58.288
<i>I thought you'd like to know
that the funeral is this Tuesday</i>

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:01.458
<i>followed by a small,
tasteful reception at my house.</i>

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.092
<i>I'm indifferent as to whether you come.</i>

01:12:03.135 --> 01:12:04.796
<i>Gentlemen, it's Craig,</i>

01:12:04.837 --> 01:12:06.532
<i>and I'm back in New York.</i>

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:07.903
I know I messed up.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:10.408
I take full responsibility
for the mistakes that I made.

01:12:10.442 --> 01:12:13.434
I'm not going to beg,
and I won't call again.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:16.381
The truth is that I was a preemie.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:20.511
I was several weeks premature, and
there was talk of oxygen deprivation.

01:12:20.552 --> 01:12:22.179
I'm not making excuses,
but the doctor said...

01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:24.314
Idiot.

01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:39.371
Oh...

01:12:39.405 --> 01:12:41.839
You know someone a bunch of years,

01:12:41.874 --> 01:12:46.072
and it's easy to forget
that you were fortunate enough

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:48.671
to have known them for even one day.

01:12:49.048 --> 01:12:53.644
And that was Lucky, to me.
I mean, he was my friend.

01:12:53.685 --> 01:12:57.280
He... Well, even more important,
he was my family.

01:12:57.322 --> 01:13:00.189
And where was I when he was
breathing his last breath?

01:13:00.225 --> 01:13:02.557
In Japan, making a business deal.

01:13:04.363 --> 01:13:07.594
Is there anyone who would like
to say anything about Lucky

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:10.534
- before we say goodbye?
- I would.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:21.378
I've had the great pleasure
of being the other old dog

01:13:21.413 --> 01:13:23.540
in Charlie's life for the past 30 years.

01:13:25.384 --> 01:13:27.648
Like Lucky,

01:13:27.686 --> 01:13:31.087
I feel like a fortunate son of a gun
to have Charlie as a friend.

01:13:36.195 --> 01:13:37.890
You're so cute.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:39.295
Here. A nice bowl of cold water.

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.731
- I'm really glad you came, man.
- Me too.

01:13:41.767 --> 01:13:43.064
It's really important to me.

01:13:44.636 --> 01:13:47.036
- I've said some things...
- Please, don't go there.

01:13:47.072 --> 01:13:48.300
- I have to.
- Why?

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:51.332
You've always had faith in me,
even when I didn't have faith in myself.

01:13:51.376 --> 01:13:54.209
You're not just my best friend,
you're the best kind of friend.

01:13:55.047 --> 01:13:57.277
You're loyal, honorable...

01:13:57.883 --> 01:14:01.683
But? See I knew there was a "but."
This is gonna sting like a mother. Go.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.483
Aside from going into business with you,

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:06.719
I've only made two good decisions
in my entire life.

01:14:06.758 --> 01:14:10.319
Marrying Vicki and taking those kids.

01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:12.853
And those are the two most impulsive
things I've done in my entire life,

01:14:12.898 --> 01:14:15.890
besides the tattoo, which,
God willing, I'll get over one day.

01:14:15.934 --> 01:14:19.734
I feel another moment of Dan Rayburn
impulsivity about to happen.

01:14:19.771 --> 01:14:22.137
Charlie, this is big.
I'm talking about uprooting,

01:14:22.174 --> 01:14:24.870
change of scenery,
the end of the business as we know it.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:28.903
Oh, Dan. We'll figure out the business.
We always do.

01:14:28.947 --> 01:14:33.577
- Yeah, but... I have to get them back.
- Nah. Absolutely not.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:36.547
We're gonna get 'em back.

01:14:37.489 --> 01:14:39.821
Yeah. Yeah, little man.

01:14:51.603 --> 01:14:55.130
- Out of the way. Dad on a mission.
- You guys aren't gonna regret this.

01:14:55.174 --> 01:14:57.506
I'll do whatever it takes
to get back into your good grace...

01:14:58.477 --> 01:15:00.638
You want to lighten up
on the throttle, Sparky?

01:15:00.679 --> 01:15:04.115
We got a zoo exit coming up here.

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:05.878
I'm not gonna miss that birthday party.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.909
It's just great to get the three amigos
back together again.

01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:10.080
You're still on probation!

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:17.092
- No, no. That's not a lock.
- You open?

01:15:17.129 --> 01:15:19.825
Nah. Sorry,
the zoo closes at 3:00 to new visitors.

01:15:19.865 --> 01:15:22.561
But my kids are in there.
They're having a birthday party,

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.001
and I have to be there because I'm Dad.

01:15:25.037 --> 01:15:27.062
Yeah. This is Dan Rayburn, superdad.

01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:29.471
Check on your list. R-A-Y-B-U-R-N.

01:15:29.508 --> 01:15:34.070
Superdad is super late, all right?
Rayburn? You know what?

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:37.275
You don't even have the same last name
as the birthday kids. Can't do it.

01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:41.082
- How does three big ones sound?
- A little money, huh?

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:44.816
Don't you ever hand me
three dollars again.

01:15:44.856 --> 01:15:46.949
- Come on. You can let us...
- You already have a kid there.

01:15:46.992 --> 01:15:48.584
- It's fine.
- I can't let you in.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.460
He's got a heart problem.
He just wants to see his kids.

01:15:51.496 --> 01:15:54.158
- You shall not pass.
- You're great at your job, man!

01:15:55.434 --> 01:15:57.925
Charlie, what are you doing?

01:15:59.238 --> 01:16:00.466
What are you thinking?

01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:04.567
Danny boy, I am going to
get you into that party,

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:07.602
at great risk
to my perfect legal record.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.771
- Through here?
- Oh, yeah. Here we go.

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:13.114
- That's breaking and entering. No, no.
- Bingo!

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:14.982
- Don't do that.
- Wait. Let me do it.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:16.647
- Why?
- I'll take the risk.

01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:18.553
OK. Go ahead.

01:16:20.425 --> 01:16:22.052
Yeah...

01:16:22.094 --> 01:16:23.721
- Come on. Come on.
- I got it.

01:16:25.297 --> 01:16:27.891
I need some help. I need help.

01:16:28.767 --> 01:16:30.359
- OK.
- Go, Craig.

01:16:30.402 --> 01:16:32.529
- Me? OK.
- Yeah, you first.

01:16:32.571 --> 01:16:35.335
What's her name?

01:16:42.547 --> 01:16:44.174
- We made it.
- We did it!

01:16:44.216 --> 01:16:48.710
Yeah! Can't keep Dan Rayburn out.

01:16:49.254 --> 01:16:51.188
Never doubt you, Charlie. Never.

01:16:51.223 --> 01:16:53.691
- We are in the zoo, guys.
- All right, which way?

01:16:53.725 --> 01:16:56.250
A moat. I wonder what lives here.

01:16:56.295 --> 01:16:58.923
We're in the gorilla enclosure.

01:16:58.964 --> 01:17:01.023
- What?
- Stand still.

01:17:01.066 --> 01:17:03.466
Hold still. Don't do it. Don't move.

01:17:03.502 --> 01:17:06.403
- Gorilla. Silverback gorilla.
- Stay where you are.

01:17:06.438 --> 01:17:08.599
Don't look at him in the eyes.
Just look away.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.666
If you don't see him, he doesn't
see you. Back up to the tunnel.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.178
You have to be aggressive with
the larger apes. I've read about this.

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.612
- Back up to the tunnel.
- No, no. No retreat.

01:17:16.648 --> 01:17:19.549
- Retreat. No, retreat.
- You retreat, we are dead.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:22.577
He senses fear, he attacks.
Be aggressive.

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:37.602
- Food!
- Don't provoke it! Charlie, no!

01:17:37.636 --> 01:17:39.228
Aah!

01:17:42.574 --> 01:17:45.441
- Oh!
- Charlie!

01:17:45.477 --> 01:17:47.502
Aggression not working.
Maybe we should be submissive.

01:17:48.347 --> 01:17:51.441
- Or run!
- Every man for himself!

01:17:51.483 --> 01:17:52.609
Run! Go!

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.344
Come on, Danny boy.

01:17:57.489 --> 01:17:58.513
Uh-oh.

01:18:13.805 --> 01:18:16.501
We're alive!

01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:19.635
- Penguins!
- Aw...

01:18:19.678 --> 01:18:21.305
- I love penguins.
- Me too.

01:18:25.217 --> 01:18:27.913
- Angry penguins!
- Save yourself!

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.011
Go to your kids!

01:18:30.856 --> 01:18:32.346
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:18:34.326 --> 01:18:36.385
Charlie! Charlie!

01:18:37.662 --> 01:18:40.688
- I love you, Charlie!
- Ooh!

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:54.610
Help. Help.
Help. Help. Help.

01:18:55.614 --> 01:18:57.138
Aahh...

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:01.518
Everybody, it's cake time.

01:19:04.556 --> 01:19:05.580
Oh!

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.021
- Birthday parties. Which way?
- They're on Adventure Island.

01:19:10.061 --> 01:19:12.393
But the tunnel's closed.
There's no way to get there from here.

01:19:12.431 --> 01:19:16.026
No, no. I got to get
to that birthday party. Please.

01:19:18.336 --> 01:19:19.360
OK.

01:19:21.206 --> 01:19:23.071
- What are you doing?
- Some little girl

01:19:23.108 --> 01:19:25.338
wants a superhero
to fly into her birthday party.

01:19:25.377 --> 01:19:28.346
- Mom calls me, I show up.
- Really?

01:19:32.117 --> 01:19:34.210
<i>We're going to sing Happy Birthday.</i>

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:37.951
- How does this work?
- You go up, you come down.

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:41.186
- It's not rocket science, chief.
- And it's safe?

01:19:41.226 --> 01:19:44.559
- Aah... Sure.
- Oh.

01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:49.892
Daddy's coming. Yeah!
Which way is the party?

01:19:49.935 --> 01:19:52.062
- Northwest!
- You got it!

01:19:52.103 --> 01:19:54.435
- Go for it!
- Yeah. Yeah!

01:19:57.509 --> 01:20:00.876
Killer penguins.
Killer penguins!

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.039
- Killer penguins!
- Charlie!

01:20:04.749 --> 01:20:07.479
Dan! What's he doing up there?

01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:10.079
Ah, he wanted to be a superhero
for his daughter's birthday.

01:20:10.121 --> 01:20:13.090
- He know what he's doing?
- It's like a ride. Don't worry.

01:20:14.793 --> 01:20:18.354
Go, Danny boy!
I'm the wind beneath your wings!

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:21.092
There's no stopping Dan Rayburn!

01:20:23.134 --> 01:20:25.500
Did you see a little man?
He's about yea-big.

01:20:25.537 --> 01:20:27.971
He's got reddish hair.
He looks like a Hobbit.

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:30.931
Just go to your happy place!

01:20:30.976 --> 01:20:36.107
- Just go to a happy place!
- One, two, three!

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:39.542
I can fly!

01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:42.814
I can fly! Yes!

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:49.385
Happy birthday, Zach and Emily!

01:20:50.662 --> 01:20:53.597
Look, guys, it's a superhero,
just like you wanted.

01:20:53.632 --> 01:20:55.793
I'm coming, kids!

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:58.959
- Oh, my gosh! Dan?
- It's Dad!

01:20:59.004 --> 01:21:01.529
- It's me, Fatherman!
- Dad!

01:21:01.573 --> 01:21:03.268
Yeah!

01:21:03.308 --> 01:21:04.332
I knew it.

01:21:04.376 --> 01:21:07.436
That's right, kids.
Believe what you see!

01:21:08.547 --> 01:21:10.242
- Isn't enough fuel.
- Be careful!

01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:42.346
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to make an impact.

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.041
Mission accomplished.

01:21:44.082 --> 01:21:46.642
I'm not that bad. It doesn't hurt.
I don't need to go to the hospital.

01:21:46.685 --> 01:21:48.744
I just need to go home and sleep it off.

01:21:49.187 --> 01:21:50.882
- You want to go home?
- Yeah.

01:21:50.922 --> 01:21:52.617
You're in Burlington.
You know that, right?

01:21:52.657 --> 01:21:55.820
I know that.
I rented a house a half mile from here.

01:21:57.395 --> 01:21:59.260
You moved here?

01:21:59.297 --> 01:22:02.357
Look, I know
I loused it up for us romantically

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.891
when I chose Japan over you.

01:22:05.437 --> 01:22:08.929
And after what happened in South Beach,
that's pretty much unforgivable.

01:22:09.474 --> 01:22:11.339
But these guys
weren't around in South Beach.

01:22:12.377 --> 01:22:15.642
Good timing or bad timing, I love them.

01:22:16.848 --> 01:22:19.715
I moved here so,
whether they want to visit me or not,

01:22:19.751 --> 01:22:21.446
I could be closer to them.

01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:25.381
I'm not a superhero, kids.
Maybe that's a good thing

01:22:25.423 --> 01:22:28.620
because, you know, superheroes
are always off fighting crime.

01:22:30.095 --> 01:22:32.529
And I just want to be with you guys...

01:22:32.831 --> 01:22:34.423
...forever, if you'll let me.

01:22:39.704 --> 01:22:41.228
Deal.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.901
You're on my oxygen!

01:22:43.942 --> 01:22:46.172
Aah!

01:23:20.278 --> 01:23:22.542
Long story short,
he gets the kids, he gets his wife.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.013
And Nishamura calls and says,

01:23:24.049 --> 01:23:26.745
"We want a family man
to represent a family business."

01:23:26.785 --> 01:23:29.720
Boom, $47 million in fees later,

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:31.779
here we are on my best friend's boat
going to Aruba.

01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:34.189
That is a true story. I mean, come on.

01:23:34.225 --> 01:23:37.126
Well, it's a good thing
you brought us down here

01:23:37.162 --> 01:23:41.121
because the high seas are a
dangerous mistress for these children.

01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:45.432
Excuse me. What are you doing
to my boat? Oh, the safety squad? Why?

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:49.270
It's my kid, OK? The fruit of my loins.
And you just relax, OK?

01:23:49.307 --> 01:23:51.332
We're going to fix this boat
so it's safe for her.

01:23:51.376 --> 01:23:52.900
Your baby's only three months old!

01:23:52.944 --> 01:23:55.572
Nick!

01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:58.138
This is not a Sizzler!

01:23:58.983 --> 01:24:00.348
All right, so two weeks.

01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:02.649
Keep the office running smooth
until the big guns get back.

01:24:02.687 --> 01:24:05.087
- That'll be my sole scope of work.
- Now, Craig,

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.421
no more karaoke. You are cut off.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.791
Not even in your own house.
You can do it.

01:24:09.828 --> 01:24:14.891
- Go To! We're gonna miss you, Go To.
- Hey, you guys are using my nickname.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:21.701
- Oh...
- Nick?

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.833
Listen. Are you good at puzzles?

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:27.504
Everybody take their
seasickness pills? Come on, guys.

01:24:27.545 --> 01:24:29.206
Wow. Should we tell?

01:24:29.247 --> 01:24:32.341
I think I remember where they go.

01:24:32.984 --> 01:24:34.474
Yeah.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.846
All right, we got the bags stowed below.
Seasickness pills

01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:41.290
<i>have been distributed.
Let's just get one bon voyage photo,</i>

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.692
and then
we're ready to shove off, folks.

01:24:43.728 --> 01:24:45.958
All right,
everyone get together for a picture.

01:24:45.997 --> 01:24:47.931
Big smiles. Let's look real happy.

01:24:47.966 --> 01:24:50.230
- Today, Craig.
- Got it?

01:24:50.268 --> 01:24:53.032
Maybe not quite so happy.
