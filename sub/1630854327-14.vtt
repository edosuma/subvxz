08:33.097 --> 08:35.998
- We won't do anything until
we find out what's going on.

08:36.032 --> 08:37.482
We'll run some tests,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.001
and then we'll get you
something for your pain.

08:39.034 --> 08:40.174
- Thank you.

08:40.209 --> 08:41.969
- I don't want surgery.

08:42.004 --> 08:43.453
I don't even think I need it.

08:43.488 --> 08:48.113
- Order a CBC, CMP,
inflammatory markers with a CT.

08:48.148 --> 08:50.184
Then put him on an IV steroid

08:50.219 --> 08:52.359
with a PRN of morphine
to make him comfortable,

08:52.393 --> 08:53.981
and page me
when you get the scans.

08:54.016 --> 08:55.845
- Uh, Dr. Webber?

08:55.880 --> 08:58.503
Do you think that maybe we
could find some time to talk?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.264
- Seems like we're
doing that now, Schmitt.

09:01.299 --> 09:04.164
- Well, I don't have
my notes with me.

09:04.198 --> 09:05.406
Right.

09:05.441 --> 09:07.408
I've been thinking
about fellowships

09:07.443 --> 09:08.858
and attending positions,

09:08.893 --> 09:10.170
and I would love
to pick your brain--

09:10.204 --> 09:11.551
- You haven't applied
for your fellowships yet?

09:11.585 --> 09:13.000
I submitted my
recommendations

09:13.035 --> 09:14.415
for most candidates months ago.

09:14.450 --> 09:15.831
- I've been exploring options,

09:15.865 --> 09:18.419
and I would love
your suggestions.

09:18.454 --> 09:19.869
- You're a fourth-year
resident, Schmitt.

09:19.904 --> 09:21.077
My suggestion would be,

09:21.112 --> 09:24.391
get your act together
sooner than later.

09:27.256 --> 09:28.740
- Nola, we're really here.

09:28.775 --> 09:30.535
You're--you're really
being examined

09:30.570 --> 09:31.709
by Dr. Margaret Pierce.

09:31.743 --> 09:33.503
I mean,
the Dr. Margaret Pierce!

09:33.538 --> 09:35.022
Meeting you in person,
it's like--

09:35.057 --> 09:36.265
- That time we met
Stevie Nicks.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.542
- I'm digging this more.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.026
- I am flattered.

09:39.061 --> 09:40.407
Oh, keep her elevated.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.409
If she's flat,
the tumor could further

09:42.443 --> 09:46.516
compress the vasculature, which
could lead to more swelling.

09:46.551 --> 09:47.690
Griffith?

09:47.725 --> 09:49.589
- Uh, Nola Marquez, 42.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.245
Developed a mediastinal mass

09:51.280 --> 09:53.213
with a tissue diagnosis
of a thymoma.

09:53.247 --> 09:54.939
The tumor grew
alongside her heart,

09:54.973 --> 09:57.010
putting pressure on it
and the vasculature,

09:57.044 --> 09:58.459
causing SVC syndrome.

09:58.494 --> 10:00.082
Symptoms include
shortness of breath

10:00.116 --> 10:01.601
and mental acuity issues.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.017
- It's not that bad.
- No one believes you.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.708
- Sisters?
- Close.

10:05.743 --> 10:07.814
We're, uh, friends since
elementary school.

10:07.848 --> 10:10.610
We met in chorus, and been
rocking together ever since.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.542
- You're in a band?
- We are a band.

10:12.577 --> 10:14.096
Double Helix.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.201
- Ever since Nola got diagnosed
she hasn't touched her guitar.

10:16.236 --> 10:19.722
- I can barely sleep,
let alone perform.

10:19.757 --> 10:21.482
Viv has dragged me
to every heart surgeon

10:21.517 --> 10:23.415
in the Pacific Northwest.

10:23.450 --> 10:24.796
No one will operate.

10:24.831 --> 10:26.591
They all say it's too risky.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.662
- Bunch of cowards.
But now we have the best.

10:28.697 --> 10:31.734
Dr. Pierce, she's--she's not
pop rock, she's Led Zeppelin.

10:31.769 --> 10:32.908
Double Helix is back.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.150
- All right, well,
first things first.

10:34.185 --> 10:36.394
Let's get some scans,
see where we are.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.223
Griffith, Millin.

10:38.258 --> 10:41.192
- Uh, she's been fasting, and
we've both been visualizing.

10:41.226 --> 10:43.919
So she's ready for surgery
the minute you are.

10:45.955 --> 10:47.785
- Why didn't you
show up with flowers?

10:47.819 --> 10:49.234
That was all I'm saying.

10:49.269 --> 10:52.237
- It was supposed to be
a grand romantic gesture.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.239
- I surprised you in Germany.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.516
- Yeah, but you came
on a plane.

10:55.551 --> 10:57.933
- Yeah, like a
regular human person.

10:57.967 --> 11:01.488
- We need to check his upper
left extremity for a fracture.

11:01.522 --> 11:03.421
Order some AP
and lateral films.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.457
- OK.

11:05.492 --> 11:06.769
- What's the lesson here?

11:06.804 --> 11:08.426
Romance can be fatal.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.048
- [chuckles]
Wouldn't be the first time.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.153
- Or it can save lives
and heal.

11:11.187 --> 11:12.223
- Oh, please.

11:12.257 --> 11:13.707
You're just trying
to prove me wrong

11:13.742 --> 11:16.227
because you didn't even know
that Jo and Link were an item.

11:16.261 --> 11:18.401
- No. No, Jo and I are--
we're just friends.

11:18.436 --> 11:19.886
- Friends who have
slept together.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.233
- Wait, you guys
slept together?

11:22.267 --> 11:23.683
- How do you know that?
- You know what?

11:23.717 --> 11:26.168
Just, uh, page me when
the scans come in.

11:27.894 --> 11:31.760
- How much longer
do I have to be in here?

11:31.794 --> 11:32.933
- Not long.

11:32.968 --> 11:35.039
Just think like
you have a health bar

11:35.073 --> 11:37.386
that needs replenishing.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.146
It's a video game reference.

11:39.181 --> 11:41.355
- I'm aware.

11:41.390 --> 11:45.428
How do you not know if you're
doing general or subspecialty?

11:45.463 --> 11:47.327
It's a fellowship reference.

11:47.361 --> 11:48.742
- Wow.

11:48.777 --> 11:51.089
You're really begging
for a pile of scut, Kwan.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.746
- No, I'm genuinely asking

11:52.781 --> 11:54.679
how you got into your
fourth year of residency

11:54.714 --> 11:56.336
without a clear direction.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.476
- Well, let's see.

11:58.510 --> 12:02.238
Maybe it was the worldwide
pandemic that happened

12:02.273 --> 12:03.757
in the middle of my residency,

12:03.792 --> 12:07.312
or the program
being shut down last year.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.694
Take your pick.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.731
- Well, I like to track
each subspecialty

12:11.765 --> 12:13.698
I'm interested in
with a spreadsheet

12:13.733 --> 12:15.458
and monitor trends
in each area.

12:15.493 --> 12:16.701
- I'm hot.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.841
And it's really dark
in here, guys.

12:18.876 --> 12:20.049
I really want to get out.

12:20.084 --> 12:24.674
- Grayson, just, um,
hum a song or sing.

12:24.709 --> 12:25.883
- Like what?

12:25.917 --> 12:28.748
- Anything inside your head.

12:30.404 --> 12:33.960
- [singing in Hebrew]

12:39.034 --> 12:40.829
- You studying for
your bar mitzvah?

12:40.863 --> 12:42.554
- Yeah.
I sound terrible.

12:42.589 --> 12:44.764
I've been practicing for
over 300 days in a row,

12:44.798 --> 12:46.317
and I still sound awful, right?

12:46.351 --> 12:48.008
- Yes.
- Keep chanting.

12:48.043 --> 12:51.080
- [singing in Hebrew]

12:54.118 --> 12:57.569
- It's acute severe colitis.

12:57.604 --> 13:00.124
- [sighs]

13:00.158 --> 13:03.196
- [singing continues]

13:14.414 --> 13:16.830
- That smells delicious.

13:16.865 --> 13:19.799
- I was thinking after we eat,
we can go on a walk.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.077
Um, I wanted to talk--

13:23.112 --> 13:25.459
Hey, what's wrong?

13:27.047 --> 13:28.393
- With Mer gone
and Maggie leaving,

13:28.428 --> 13:30.706
there's not going to
be any Sunday dinners.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.397
- Mm.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.917
- On Sundays, Maggie cooks,

13:34.952 --> 13:36.746
and she puts enough leftovers
in my fridge

13:36.781 --> 13:37.955
to get me to Wednesday.

13:37.989 --> 13:40.716
- So maybe it's time
to learn how to cook.

13:43.753 --> 13:46.722
- I have a history of spiraling
when people leave me,

13:46.756 --> 13:49.552
and a good old-fashioned
spiral does not leave

13:49.587 --> 13:51.900
much time for cooking lessons.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.867
- What does it leave time for?

13:53.902 --> 13:56.042
- All kinds of fun things.

13:56.076 --> 13:59.665
Uh, pulling away
from people you love,

13:59.700 --> 14:03.221
starting fights, lack of sleep,

14:03.256 --> 14:06.121
spilling your worst instincts
to someone who just flew

14:06.155 --> 14:10.021
halfway across the country
to cook for you.

14:10.056 --> 14:12.058
- You love your sisters.

14:12.092 --> 14:15.716
This is a big change.
Anybody would be sad, Amelia.

14:18.271 --> 14:21.861
- How could I be sad
with you here?

14:29.040 --> 14:31.560
[PA announcement]

14:33.803 --> 14:35.426
- Yasuda, I have a job for you.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.980
- Oh, Dr. Bailey, thank you.

14:38.015 --> 14:39.085
At your service.

14:39.119 --> 14:43.020
- Hey, I need you
to hold on to this.

14:43.054 --> 14:46.540
That is my lifeline,
and I'm entrusting it to you.

14:46.575 --> 14:48.957
Do not answer it
unless caller ID says

14:48.991 --> 14:51.787
it's my husband Ben Warren,
or a hospital number.

14:51.821 --> 14:52.995
- Got it.

14:53.030 --> 14:56.171
So Grey Sloan,
your husband, or Ben Warren?

14:56.205 --> 14:57.793
- My husband is Ben Warren.

14:57.827 --> 15:00.244
Do I need to entrust this
to someone else?

15:00.278 --> 15:01.935
- Nope.
I got this.

15:01.970 --> 15:03.937
Entrust me.

15:06.491 --> 15:07.907
- Hey,
if you don't screw it up,

15:07.941 --> 15:10.944
maybe she'll entrust you
to babysit her tablet next.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.947
[phone buzzes]

15:13.982 --> 15:15.915
[chuckles]

15:19.194 --> 15:21.196
- Do I need to get surgery?

15:21.230 --> 15:23.336
- We should really wait
for your parents.

15:23.370 --> 15:24.820
- I can't get surgery.

15:24.854 --> 15:26.891
My bar mitzvah's
to be in 36 hours.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.582
- You haven't been
taking your medication.

15:28.617 --> 15:29.583
- What?

15:29.618 --> 15:31.931
No, I have.
Every day.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.587
My parents set this,
um, annoying alarm.

15:33.622 --> 15:34.899
Um--

15:34.934 --> 15:37.005
- Grayson,
I have your urine results.

15:37.039 --> 15:40.318
The labs don't lie,
but sometimes patients do.

15:44.529 --> 15:47.187
- Yeah, OK, I--
I stopped.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.982
But just for a little bit.

15:49.017 --> 15:50.190
I've been in these
Hebrew classes,

15:50.225 --> 15:51.812
and the pills and infusions,
they made me--

15:51.847 --> 15:54.022
they made me really tired,
so tired that I--

15:54.056 --> 15:56.024
I fainted one day,
and everyone saw.

15:56.058 --> 15:58.440
And then the--the medications,
they dried my eyes out.

15:58.474 --> 16:00.097
And then the eye drops,
they burned.

16:00.131 --> 16:02.306
And I got this gross-looking
rash on my neck

16:02.340 --> 16:03.686
that Eloise Schurmann saw--

16:03.721 --> 16:05.688
- Do you know how worried
your parents have been?

16:05.723 --> 16:06.966
- Dr. Webber--

16:07.000 --> 16:08.968
- How much money they've
spent on your treatments?

16:09.002 --> 16:11.453
Now you need surgery.
- No. No surgery.

16:11.487 --> 16:12.764
It doesn't even hurt
that badly.

16:12.799 --> 16:14.697
Just--just give me some
steroids or infusions.

16:14.732 --> 16:16.941
The Torah portion
is only 25 minutes.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.632
I can make 25 minutes.
- No, you can't.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.117
- Please.
- If you don't get

16:20.151 --> 16:22.015
the surgery immediately, the
inflammation in your intestine

16:22.050 --> 16:23.672
will get worse, spread further,

16:23.706 --> 16:25.674
and lead to an incredibly
serious infection.

16:25.708 --> 16:28.470
You would be in excruciating
pain, and you would die.

16:28.504 --> 16:29.471
- Kwan!
- You know what?

16:29.505 --> 16:30.886
Dr. Kwan is right.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.751
Grayson, you're not an adult,
and you're not a doctor.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.477
I'm talking to your parents,
because clearly

16:35.511 --> 16:37.479
you aren't mature enough
to understand how much

16:37.513 --> 16:39.964
we care about you,
and how much harm

16:39.999 --> 16:44.003
you could have done
to yourself.

16:49.111 --> 16:50.664
- OK, Hudson's X-rays are in.

16:50.699 --> 16:52.321
[phone dings]
- Uh, sorry. One sec.

16:52.356 --> 16:53.529
It's Jo.

16:53.564 --> 16:56.532
[chuckles]
[message blips]

16:57.395 --> 16:59.294
Um, it looks like a simple

16:59.328 --> 17:01.192
mildly displaced
humeral fracture.

17:01.227 --> 17:03.505
- Yeah, and a shattered spleen
with decreasing responses

17:03.539 --> 17:04.816
to fluids.
[phone dings]

17:04.851 --> 17:07.026
Teddy and I can take him up
for an ex-lap now.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.200
- And I will set and reduce
the fracture when you're done.

17:09.234 --> 17:10.891
- Mm-hmm.
[phone dings]

17:10.925 --> 17:12.962
- [laughs]
[message blips]

17:14.585 --> 17:16.137
I know what you're thinking--

17:16.173 --> 17:18.520
that I should tell Jo
I have feelings for her.

17:18.554 --> 17:20.867
But listen, we built a home
together as friends.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.179
Our kids are
practically siblings.

17:22.213 --> 17:23.869
If I make a move and she
doesn't feel the same way,

17:23.904 --> 17:24.973
it's over.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.390
Saying something
is not a good idea.

17:26.424 --> 17:28.288
- That is not at all
what I was thinking.

17:28.323 --> 17:29.358
- So you think
it's a good idea?

17:29.393 --> 17:30.877
- I have no opinion.

17:30.911 --> 17:33.121
Plus, the last person I talked
to about their relationship

17:33.155 --> 17:35.640
was Ndugu, and his wife is
moving to another state.

17:35.675 --> 17:36.952
- Not to mention
him and Altman.

17:36.986 --> 17:39.472
