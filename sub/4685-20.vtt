- I can't believe - you're finally going
out on - Your first date with Jessie!

00:06.716 --> 00:08.007
Are you nervous?

00:08.132 --> 00:09.239
Naw. This is our

00:09.240 --> 00:10.344
fourth first date.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.345
- First,
- I got pepper sprayed,

00:11.470 --> 00:13.431
- Then she got
- glued to Chesterfield,

00:13.556 --> 00:14.849
Then we both

00:14.850 --> 00:16.140
got dumped in mud.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.936
- Maybe I
- should be nervous.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.875
Don't worry, Tony.

00:19.876 --> 00:21.689
You know what they say.

00:21.814 --> 00:24.275
Fourth time's the...

00:24.400 --> 00:25.401
Time no one

00:25.402 --> 00:26.402
goes to the hospital?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.217
I'm sure

00:28.218 --> 00:29.906
nothing's gonna

00:26.527 --> 00:29.906
go wrong this time.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.177
Remember,

00:31.178 --> 00:32.323
girls love a gentleman,

00:32.450 --> 00:33.910
so offer

00:33.911 --> 00:35.369
her your jacket

00:32.450 --> 00:35.369
if she gets cold.

00:35.494 --> 00:36.829
But what if I get cold?

00:36.955 --> 00:38.436
Do you want

00:38.437 --> 00:39.916
to be comfortable

00:36.955 --> 00:39.916
or in a relationship?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.292
- Because you
- can't have both.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.545
Hey, Tony.

00:44.546 --> 00:45.671

00:45.797 --> 00:48.674

00:48.800 --> 00:50.030
Oh, don't worry.

00:50.031 --> 00:51.260
It's just a little

00:48.800 --> 00:51.260
something I made.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.430

- But I don't even
- know where we're...

08:47.445 --> 08:48.653
- Don't you
- sass me, mister!

08:51.323 --> 08:52.604
- What's with
- the third degree?

08:52.657 --> 08:53.909
- I thought
- you liked Tony.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.557
I do, but since

08:55.558 --> 08:57.079
Jessie's dad isn't here,

08:57.204 --> 08:59.373
it's my job to protect her.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.125
- You know
- what boys are like.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.709
- Hey! Some of us
- are gentlemen.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.149
Yeah, till you

09:04.150 --> 09:05.463
get cake in you.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.631
Then you go all crazy.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.716
- Actually, Zuri,
- that's you.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.302
Oh, right.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.307
(GASPS)

09:16.432 --> 09:18.100
Wow!

09:18.225 --> 09:19.101
You look...

09:19.226 --> 09:21.853
Wow!

09:21.979 --> 09:23.231
You look pretty

09:23.232 --> 09:24.482
"wow" yourself

09:21.979 --> 09:24.482
and very blue.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.610
Here,

09:27.611 --> 09:28.944
give her this.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.009
Uh, look, Jessie,

09:31.010 --> 09:32.948
I got you a...

09:33.073 --> 09:34.325
Flower in a to-go box?

09:35.451 --> 09:36.452
It's a corsage.

09:37.453 --> 09:38.496
Pin it on her.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.771
But watch those hands.

09:42.772 --> 09:44.543
No wandering fingers.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.588
Ow. Ow!

09:48.713 --> 09:50.153
Ow. Maybe I will

09:50.154 --> 09:51.591
just hold it. Ow!

09:54.386 --> 09:55.575
Don't they make

09:55.576 --> 09:56.763
an adorable couple?

09:56.888 --> 09:59.683
Oy. They grow up so fast.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.603
- So, this is all
- very glamorous.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.147
Can you finally tell us

10:05.148 --> 10:06.565
where we're going?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.442
Yup. Right this way.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.950
Jessie, welcome to

10:15.951 --> 10:17.659
your do-over prom!

10:17.784 --> 10:21.246
Wow, this is awesome!

10:21.372 --> 10:23.144
Look, she loves it!

10:23.145 --> 10:24.916
She's pale with happiness.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.420
- I think
- I'm gonna be sick.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.547
Watch the suit!

10:33.133 --> 10:34.510
Come on, Ravi!

10:34.511 --> 10:35.886
You can do it!

10:33.133 --> 10:35.886
You can do it!

10:36.011 --> 10:37.095
(GRUNTING)

10:39.557 --> 10:41.016
I could not do it.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.643
- Well, maybe you
- could lift me up?

10:43.768 --> 10:46.980
With these noodle arms?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.735
Oh! That can't be good.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.300
The long arm

10:53.301 --> 10:54.738
of the gods

10:51.860 --> 10:54.738
is coming for us!

10:54.863 --> 10:56.198
(BOTH SCREAMING)

11:04.540 --> 11:07.000
That was awesome!

11:09.086 --> 11:10.441
The heavens are raining

11:10.442 --> 11:11.796
their tea-stained

11:09.086 --> 11:11.796
tears down upon us!

11:11.922 --> 11:15.967
Please, call someone!

11:16.093 --> 11:17.490
No, I will not

11:17.491 --> 11:18.887
come help you!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.514
It's the season premiere

11:20.515 --> 11:22.015
of Ice Road Butlers.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.309
Jeeves is hauling an

11:24.310 --> 11:26.478
18-wheeler full of doilies

11:22.140 --> 11:26.478
across the frozen tundra.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.690
You're where?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.610
What kind of idiots

11:32.611 --> 11:34.403
would get themselves

11:30.815 --> 11:34.403
stuck in a giant teacup?

11:34.528 --> 11:35.529
(SCREAMS)

11:37.615 --> 11:39.658
Welcome, fellow idiot.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.783
(BOTH LAUGHING)

11:40.825 --> 11:41.910
It's more slippery

11:41.911 --> 11:42.994
than it looks!

11:46.957 --> 11:48.250
- We've got to
- call someone!

11:49.501 --> 11:50.835
I'm getting claustrophobic

11:50.961 --> 11:52.358
and I don't like being

11:52.359 --> 11:53.755
this close to dirty dishes.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.441
- Or dirty laundry.
- Or dirty anything.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.926
Give me that phone!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.637
- I'm calling the
- fire department!

12:03.223 --> 12:04.391
(EXCLAIMING)

12:06.560 --> 12:08.228
My phone!

12:08.353 --> 12:09.605
Now how are

12:09.606 --> 12:10.855
we going to call

12:08.353 --> 12:10.855
anyone for help?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.920
Like this!

12:12.921 --> 12:14.859
Help! Help! Help!

12:21.783 --> 12:23.285
Jessie, we didn't

12:23.286 --> 12:24.786
mean to upset you.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.246
Yeah.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.581
We're really sorry.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.041
Oh. It's okay, guys.

12:29.042 --> 12:30.375
I know you meant well.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.503
It's just that

12:32.504 --> 12:34.505
my prom was a very

12:30.501 --> 12:34.505
traumatic experience.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.819
Well, maybe

12:35.820 --> 12:37.007
you'll feel better

12:34.630 --> 12:37.007
if you talk about it.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.155
Yeah, so make like

12:38.156 --> 12:39.176
your guts and spill!

12:41.845 --> 12:42.867
Vance and I

12:42.868 --> 12:43.888
were dancing

12:41.845 --> 12:43.888
by the giant fish tank.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.974
- I got a little
- carried away

12:46.099 --> 12:48.101
And accidentally

12:48.102 --> 12:50.103
did the electric slide

12:46.099 --> 12:50.103
into the electric eels.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.022
I was utterly humiliated.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.400
- That octopus
- was all tentacles.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.987
- It was the worst
- night of my life.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.240
- Vance and I
- never spoke again.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.950
And thanks to his photo,

13:04.075 --> 13:05.661
my misery lived on.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.225
In the yearbook,

13:07.226 --> 13:08.664
I was voted

13:05.785 --> 13:08.664
"Class Clown-Fish"

13:08.788 --> 13:09.894
and "Most Likely

13:09.895 --> 13:10.999
to Grow a Barnacle."

13:11.124 --> 13:13.001
(LAUGHING)

13:13.126 --> 13:14.211
That's funny.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.381
But mean.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.463
You can't just stop dating.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.823
You always

13:21.824 --> 13:23.136
tell us not to give up.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.493
Right. When I fell off

13:24.494 --> 13:25.723
my rocking horse,

13:25.847 --> 13:27.078
I was ready to

13:27.079 --> 13:28.308
put her out to pasture.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.789
But you

13:29.790 --> 13:31.144
promised me ice cream

13:28.433 --> 13:31.144
if I climbed back on.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.396
I did, didn't I?

13:32.521 --> 13:33.751
Yep. And I fell

13:33.752 --> 13:34.981
right on my butt again.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.441
Plus, I didn't get

13:36.442 --> 13:37.776
any ice cream. And...

13:37.901 --> 13:40.779
Good story, Zuri.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.010
Look, Jessie,

13:43.011 --> 13:45.116
Tony is no Vance.

13:40.904 --> 13:45.116
He'd never laugh at you.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.452
And you have given him

13:46.453 --> 13:47.661
plenty of opportunities.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.496
I'll say.

13:49.621 --> 13:50.665
Remember the time

13:50.666 --> 13:51.707
your dress got caught

13:49.621 --> 13:51.707
in the elevator?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.768
- And the time - you snorked that peanut
- Out of your nose?

13:53.792 --> 13:55.186
- And the time - you sat on the...
- Okay, guys.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.545
Thanks for the pep talk.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.403
The point is,

14:00.404 --> 14:01.925
out there waiting for you

13:58.880 --> 14:01.925
is a really awesome guy

14:02.050 --> 14:04.177
in a really awful tux.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.162
You're right.

14:08.163 --> 14:09.600
Especially about the tux.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.081
I'm gonna go out there

14:11.082 --> 14:12.436
and I'm going to have fun.

14:12.561 --> 14:14.563
But not too much fun.

14:14.564 --> 14:16.565
I'm watching you.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.444
Wow, the girls

14:20.445 --> 14:21.737
really went all out.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.196
But these

14:23.197 --> 14:24.531
starfish cookies

14:21.861 --> 14:24.531
are a little chewy.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.366
- That's because
- they're plastic.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.367
Oh.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.493
Then they're pretty good.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.164
This is going great!

14:33.290 --> 14:34.975
- I can't wait for - them to have their
- First romantic dance!

14:34.999 --> 14:37.377
Look at the stars.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.067
We sure got

14:39.068 --> 14:40.631
a beautiful night

14:37.502 --> 14:40.631
for our fifth first date.

14:40.756 --> 14:41.903
Yeah. And it looks

14:41.904 --> 14:43.049
like we're actually going to

14:40.756 --> 14:43.049
make it through this time

14:43.174 --> 14:44.414
- without anyone
- getting hurt!

14:45.594 --> 14:46.886
(YELLING)

14:49.222 --> 14:50.662
Holy cannoli!

14:50.663 --> 14:52.100
That's not good!

14:52.225 --> 14:53.415
What, is there an asteroid

14:53.416 --> 14:54.603
hurtling towards Earth?

14:54.728 --> 14:56.168
- Why does everything
- happen to me?

14:58.523 --> 14:59.899
Oh, my gosh!

15:00.024 --> 15:02.184
- These kids - could sure use some
- Adult supervision.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.403
Sorry.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.470
- Wait, we were - just going to announce
- The prom court!

15:10.494 --> 15:11.870
Thanks for the

15:11.871 --> 15:13.246
magical evening, girls,

15:13.371 --> 15:14.582
but we have to

15:14.583 --> 15:15.791
go save your brothers.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.791
Emma, watch Zuri.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.543
By the way, you're both

15:17.544 --> 15:19.169
officially my favorites.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.130
I can't believe those

15:21.131 --> 15:22.964
losers upset Jessie

15:19.294 --> 15:22.964
on her big night!

15:23.089 --> 15:24.090
She's gonna be even

15:24.091 --> 15:25.091
more upset when she finds

15:23.089 --> 15:25.091
out she's not Prom Queen.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.813
- Come on.
- Tony, hurry up!

15:37.937 --> 15:39.919
No!

15:39.920 --> 15:41.900
If I rip Uncle Joey's suit,

15:37.937 --> 15:41.900
he's gonna bury me in it.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.673
I'm really

15:43.674 --> 15:45.320
looking forward to

15:42.025 --> 15:45.320
meeting your family.

15:47.030 --> 15:47.906
- Jessie!
- Jessie!

15:48.031 --> 15:49.345
What am I,

15:49.346 --> 15:50.659
chopped liver?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.327
- Ravi, Luke,
- are you guys okay?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.620
Yes, we're fine.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.163
Speak for yourselves.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.644
We're stuck under

15:56.645 --> 15:57.999
a teapot gushing

15:55.288 --> 15:57.999
East River water!

15:58.124 --> 15:59.668
Get us out of here!

16:00.669 --> 16:02.295
Bertram, get a grip!

16:02.420 --> 16:03.776
I'm sorry.

16:03.777 --> 16:05.131
I have a fear

16:02.420 --> 16:05.131
of tight spaces.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.800
- Then how do you
- wear those pants?

16:08.385 --> 16:09.866
Jessie,

16:09.867 --> 16:11.346
did you bring a rope?

16:08.385 --> 16:11.346
No.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.078
What is it with

16:13.079 --> 16:14.683
you people and your

16:11.471 --> 16:14.683
lack of emergency tools?

16:16.601 --> 16:18.144
Here's what we'll do.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.955
- Jessie, - grab on to my waist
- And I'll hang over the side

16:19.979 --> 16:21.231
- And pull the kids up.
- Okay.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.401
(LAUGHING)

16:24.526 --> 16:26.319
That tickles!

16:26.444 --> 16:28.029
- Don't tell Zuri
- we're doing this.

16:29.907 --> 16:31.012
Okay, kids,

16:31.013 --> 16:32.116
just grab my hands.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.786
- Take me first!
- Take me!

16:40.124 --> 16:41.310
- Bertram!
- When I said "get a grip,"

16:41.334 --> 16:42.419
I didn't mean

16:42.420 --> 16:43.503
on my prom date!

16:45.338 --> 16:46.757
It's okay, Jessie,

16:46.758 --> 16:48.174
I didn't get hurt.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.595
That's because my back

16:51.596 --> 16:52.679
broke your fall.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.140
This isn't going well.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.768
I can't believe

16:57.769 --> 16:59.269
our beautiful prom cake

16:56.266 --> 16:59.269
is going to waste!

16:59.394 --> 17:00.434
- Don't worry,
- I'm on it.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.421
Tony, put Ravi,

17:04.422 --> 17:05.442
then Luke on your back,

17:03.398 --> 17:05.442
so I can haul them out.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.987
Wait, wait! Me first!

17:09.112 --> 17:10.238
- Let me step
- on your back!

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
Goodbye, vertebrae.

17:13.366 --> 17:18.162
(GRUNTING) No! No!

17:19.873 --> 17:22.459
Help Tony with the boys.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.104
- Ow! That really
- hurt my hammer toe.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.817
All this

17:26.818 --> 17:28.381
"women and children first"

17:25.252 --> 17:28.381
bunk is a load of hooey.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.430
I suppose

17:35.431 --> 17:36.514
you want me to

17:34.345 --> 17:36.514
boost you up now?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.933
- Yeah,
- and don't rip the suit.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.831
It's 100% polyester.

17:39.832 --> 17:41.603
A chainsaw couldn't rip it.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.447
(ALL GRUNTING)

17:52.572 --> 17:53.448
- Come on,
- put your back into it!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.096
I've got

17:55.097 --> 17:56.618
everything into it!

17:56.743 --> 17:58.286
- Is your leg
- tied to an anvil?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.418
(LAUGHING)

18:05.543 --> 18:07.275
Again,

18:07.276 --> 18:09.006
even a step ladder

18:05.543 --> 18:09.006
would have been useful!

18:10.548 --> 18:11.800
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:14.011 --> 18:15.909
Hey, Mom.

18:15.910 --> 18:17.806
We miss you, too.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.292
- No, Jessie isn't... - Can't come to the
- Phone right now.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.065
She's, uh,

18:27.231 --> 18:28.775
having a cup of tea.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.298
Actually,

18:30.299 --> 18:31.695
a cup of tea

18:28.900 --> 18:31.695
is having her.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.533
Jessie, did I tell you, you

18:36.534 --> 18:37.951
look really pretty tonight?

18:38.076 --> 18:39.161
Thanks. I think the butler

18:39.162 --> 18:40.244
on my head

18:40.370 --> 18:42.455
really sets off the dress.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.792
- Less flirting,
- more lifting!

18:45.917 --> 18:47.794
- Oh, shut it,
- you big lug!

18:52.423 --> 18:53.571
Okay.

18:53.572 --> 18:54.718
Now grab my hand

18:52.423 --> 18:54.718
and pull me up!

18:54.843 --> 18:56.116
Geez, let me catch

18:56.117 --> 18:57.387
my breath! I'm tired!

18:57.512 --> 18:58.722
BOTH: You're tired?

19:02.893 --> 19:04.123
Tony, I can't believe

19:04.124 --> 19:05.353
another date got ruined.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.190
This is the worst.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.192
- Even worse than
- your prom disaster?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.195
No, but that

19:13.196 --> 19:15.072
ended up with

19:11.317 --> 19:15.072
me all wet,

19:15.196 --> 19:17.156
- and my date laughing
- so hard he wet himself.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.784
Then that guy was a jerk.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.327
With bladder control issues.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.935
Jessie, look!

19:23.936 --> 19:25.373
We're finally

19:22.495 --> 19:25.373
alone together,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.021
and there's no way

19:27.022 --> 19:28.543
you're going to get soaked

19:25.498 --> 19:28.543
all the way up here.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.051
Are you kidding me?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.263
- Come on!
- Where's the octopus?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.015
Hey, calm down.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.851
I can't!

19:43.852 --> 19:45.560
When I get steamed up,

19:42.140 --> 19:45.560
that's when I shout!

19:45.685 --> 19:47.126
- Yeah, and you
- spit a little, too.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.941
I'm sorry. It's just...

19:51.066 --> 19:52.401
I really like you,

19:52.402 --> 19:53.735
and I wanted this

19:51.066 --> 19:53.735
night to be perfect.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.864
But it is.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.472
Why are you

20:01.473 --> 20:02.535
not laughing at me?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.535
I look ridiculous.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.204
No, you don't.

20:04.205 --> 20:05.747
You look beautiful.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.457
Yeah, right.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.042
I'm a mess.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.466
Make that a hot mess.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.844
Yes! He kissed her!

20:19.970 --> 20:21.138
He better not do it again,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.972
or that young man and I

20:22.973 --> 20:24.682
are gonna have words!

20:26.476 --> 20:27.644
This is great!

20:27.769 --> 20:29.538
- There's just one more
- thing we need to do.

Of course not!

21:25.202 --> 21:26.870
- I really
- need a date.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.334
Jessie looks so happy.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.961
She's just pretending.

The lengths

21:36.652 --> 21:38.215
that woman will go to

21:35.086 --> 21:38.215
to make me jealous.

Aw, they're still dancing!

Keep those hands

Not that far
