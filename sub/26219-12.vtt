07:47.166 --> 07:49.235
Like Sky ain't even
have that title.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.770
Like this is just some

07:50.837 --> 07:52.638
Ceaser's trying to do
to get back at Sky.

07:52.705 --> 07:53.806
He's tripping.

07:53.873 --> 07:54.941
- Well, I have to say...

07:59.212 --> 08:00.980
- Oooh!

both hands and a grapefruit,
bitch, you talented.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.018

I'm not getting dragged

08:06.085 --> 08:07.720
into this petty drama no more.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.756
I'm trying to run
a [bleep] franchise here.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.659
And all that trash talking
does is distract me

08:13.726 --> 08:15.394
from my mother [bleep] goal.

08:15.461 --> 08:16.963
This is how [bleep] go.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.198
I'm the [bleep] CEO.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.566
Ted's the president.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.401
And she's
the [bleep] vice president.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.537
- I love titles.
I love titles.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.672
They don't really
mean [bleep] though, like.

08:26.739 --> 08:30.376
What world do we live in that
you go from manager in training

08:30.443 --> 08:32.144
to now you're VP?

08:32.211 --> 08:34.647
Ceaser's just thirsty
to give out some [bleep] titles.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.450
Like all Tatiana deserves is
a [bleep] breath mint

08:37.515 --> 08:39.051
for all the [bleep]
she's been [bleep].

08:39.118 --> 08:42.321
Clearly, she's been doing
sexual favors for Cease and Ted.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.924
- This is the problem in itself
is that he's here

08:44.991 --> 08:49.061
trying to talk, and nobody
will even let him talk.

08:49.128 --> 08:52.164
- I think Tati being promoted
to VP is definitely a good idea.

08:52.231 --> 08:53.299
She's loyal to the shop.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.734
She's very strong-minded.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.435
And she doesn't
tolerate bull [bleep],

08:56.502 --> 08:57.904
especially from Donna.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.940
Which means she's definitely
suitable for this position.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.009
- You better be gracious
with your promotion, bitch,

09:03.075 --> 09:05.444
because you will get dog-walked
the [bleep] out of here.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.613
- You beat your VP up,
she gonna fire your ass!

09:07.680 --> 09:09.115
- DONNA:
I don't give a [bleep].

09:09.181 --> 09:10.549
- Why is this
always about Donna?

09:10.616 --> 09:13.185
- Don't cross that line.

09:13.252 --> 09:15.655
I just told you

20:00.098 --> 20:02.034
- Hey, there you go.
- What up, man?

20:02.100 --> 20:05.904
- Oh squad.
- Team of all teams, what's up?

20:05.971 --> 20:07.339
Okay.

20:07.406 --> 20:10.309
- Let me introduce you mother
[bleep] to Money Militia.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
These are my new artists.

20:12.444 --> 20:16.214
All they about is
the bottom line, money.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.051
And if ain't about no money,
it ain't about [bleep].

20:19.117 --> 20:21.587
Out with the old,
in with the new.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.389
{\an8}I'm bringing some
new tattoo artists, bitches.

20:24.456 --> 20:27.426
Over the years, I've been to
a ton of tattoo conventions

20:27.492 --> 20:31.163
and met some awesome tattoo
artists I always wanted to hire.

20:31.229 --> 20:33.365
So, I finally
pulled the trigger.

20:33.432 --> 20:35.300
I'm looking at some of
your work. [bleep] pretty dope.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.868
You willing to come up
to New York?

to Black Ink, man.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.306
I like [bleep] that hustle.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.943
Not only are these [bleep]
some talented tattoo artists,

20:45.010 --> 20:46.912
but they competitive
as [bleep].

20:46.979 --> 20:51.984
And that is the attitude that is
severely lacking in this bitch.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.652
You see? They're wearing
Black Ink shirts,

20:53.719 --> 20:54.987
repping the brand.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.289
Don't see no Black Ink shirts
on none of y'all [bleep].

20:57.356 --> 20:59.257
- [bleep] you be telling us
to leave the merch alone.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.059
- I tell y'all to buy the merch.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.260
At least they buy it.

I don't like your attitude.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.235
- Wow!

21:10.302 --> 21:12.237
What are you gonna do?
Fire me, too.

21:27.853 --> 21:31.757
Look at her.
I just wanna squeeze her cheeks.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.725
And this mother [bleep]

21:33.792 --> 21:35.527
a few [bleep] in his time,

21:35.594 --> 21:38.096

he would kill some more.

21:38.163 --> 21:39.665
I'm not gonna
mess with that one.

This is my dream, and this
is how I'm gonna run it.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.285
That's why Donna
ain't here no more.

22:00.352 --> 22:01.987
That's why Alex
ain't here no more.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.056
That's why Sky's
not here no more.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.525
- Now this is the Ceaser
I like to see.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.860

{\an8}All these new changes is
exactly what we need

22:11.563 --> 22:13.832
{\an8}to bring Black Ink
to another level.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.069
- If y'all mother [bleep] think
I won't replace y'all,

22:17.135 --> 22:19.004

22:19.071 --> 22:20.839
You see what I just did.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.375
Understand, if I can't
get it with y'all,

22:23.442 --> 22:25.410

You smell that?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.118

22:33.185 --> 22:34.619

and it feels like--

22:34.686 --> 22:37.089
it feels like a new day
in here.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.991
And because I'm in
such a celebratory mood,

22:40.058 --> 22:43.462
I'm gonna throw a party

So, let's go.
- Alright, girl.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.554
{\an8}- I have to say, I think Ceaser
just lost his damn mind.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.356
At first, I was gonna
give him a pass,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.291
because I thought he was
just mad at Sky.

23:13.358 --> 23:16.428
Then he fired Donna and Alex,
and now this.

23:16.495 --> 23:19.231
- [door buzzes]
- Hey. How you doing?

23:19.297 --> 23:20.699

23:25.604 --> 23:27.305

23:27.372 --> 23:29.875
This is exactly the ambition
we've been missing here.

23:29.941 --> 23:32.244
It's all about making sure
