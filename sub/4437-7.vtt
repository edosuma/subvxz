Mr. Pines, whose birthday is it, again?

00:42.793 --> 00:44.795
Nobody's. Thought this party
might be a good way

to get kids to spend money
at the Shack.

of this town want fun?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.976
I'll smother them with fun!

yourself useful and copy these fliers?

That's not their slogan. I just really feel
that way about the copier store.

You know the old copier in my office?

Yeah, see, this isn't banter.
This is what I want to avoid with Wendy.

You can't just go and dance with her.

You won't believe it, guys!
I bumped into Wendy accidentally

15:24.674 --> 15:25.971
and things are actually going great.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.978

the plan anymore, you know?

15:41.399 --> 15:42.901
If you're not gonna stick to the plan,

maybe you shouldn't be
the Dipper to dance with Wendy.

I should get to dance with Wendy
