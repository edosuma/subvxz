00:09.760 --> 00:11.720
Wow, this place is amazing.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.597
Yeah, for such a small town.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.432
Middleton offers a lot

00:13.639 --> 00:15.432
of unexpected things.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.767
(CHUCKLES) True.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.770
Feels good to stretch my legs.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.814
Yeah, but we've been poring

00:19.812 --> 00:21.814
over resumes for an hour.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.107
I did not think it would

00:22.898 --> 00:24.107
be this hard

00:24.149 --> 00:25.776
to find a field supervisor.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.194
The perfect person is out

00:25.818 --> 00:27.194
there.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.320
I have a feeling.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.030
Well, with your help,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.030
I'm sure I'll find them.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.034
Nice work.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.872
So tell me, how can I pay

00:35.744 --> 00:37.872
you back for all this work?

00:37.913 --> 00:39.915
Oh, buying me dinner

00:37.913 --> 00:39.915
is enough.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.208
-You're letting me off cheap.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.208
-(LAUGHS)

00:41.249 --> 00:42.793
But come on, I wanna do

00:42.835 --> 00:44.252
something really special

00:42.835 --> 00:44.252
for you.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.045
To be honest, this is

00:44.294 --> 00:46.045
as much fun as it is work.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.382
That's how I see it.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.967
I wish my students would have

00:50.009 --> 00:53.303
a quarter of your enthusiasm,

00:50.009 --> 00:53.303
and focus, and patience.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.180
It seems like no one wants

00:53.345 --> 00:55.180
to wait for anything anymore.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.474
And archaeology is about

00:55.222 --> 00:57.474
delayed gratification.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.893
Yeah, it's about trusting

00:57.516 --> 00:58.893
your instincts.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.143
Continuing ahead

01:00.185 --> 01:01.854
even when all the

01:00.185 --> 01:01.854
evidence is against you.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.313
-Faith.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.313
-In the face of doubt.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.734
You have that.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.403
So do you.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.655
We both have a willingness

01:09.444 --> 01:11.655
to wait for something good.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.448
Even if you can't

01:11.697 --> 01:13.448
see it, you can feel it.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.868
Like minds.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.945
-Hey!

01:50.986 --> 01:52.153
Did you get today's paper?

01:52.195 --> 01:54.197
I did. It's right on

01:52.195 --> 01:54.197
the counter.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
Ugh, I swear,

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
that paperboy hates me.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.493
I just want

01:57.451 --> 01:58.493
to look at the forecast.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.620
Don't you get the

01:58.535 --> 01:59.620
weather on your phone?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.955
I do.

02:00.996 --> 02:01.872
I don't like what

02:00.996 --> 02:01.872
my phone says.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.625
My friend Doug's coming to

02:03.164 --> 02:04.625
town next Saturday

02:04.666 --> 02:05.876
and he thinks we can

02:04.666 --> 02:05.876
play golf.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.586
Oh. It's freezing!

02:07.628 --> 02:09.379
Yeah, well, as long as

02:07.628 --> 02:09.379
there's no snow on the course,

02:07.628 --> 02:09.379
he'll play.

02:09.421 --> 02:10.965
-Really?

02:09.421 --> 02:10.965
-Yeah, he's pretty hardcore

02:11.006 --> 02:12.173
when it comes to sports.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.134
But it doesn't look good.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.886
But forecasters are usually

02:14.175 --> 02:15.886
wrong, aren't they?

02:15.928 --> 02:18.806
The weather can change

02:15.928 --> 02:18.806
instantaneously.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.806
It's mercurial.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.432
Which means they are wrong

02:18.847 --> 02:20.432
more than they're right.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.600
That's one way to look at it.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.392
-(CHUCKLING)

02:21.642 --> 02:22.392
-It's the truth.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.186

02:31.110 --> 02:32.152
(SIGHS) Yeah, they

02:31.110 --> 02:32.152
want to send a representative

02:32.193 --> 02:33.528
to talk to me.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.030
You know, it's a great

02:33.570 --> 02:35.030
opportunity

02:35.072 --> 02:38.033
that a few years ago I

02:35.072 --> 02:38.033
probably would have jumped at.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.701
But things have changed.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.496
Yeah, well, like the weather.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.705
I've changed.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.667
Between my practice and Nick,

02:43.747 --> 02:46.667
I'm already short on time.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.544
I told them I'm not interested

02:46.708 --> 02:49.544
but they're not giving up.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.797
Well, they know a good thing

02:49.586 --> 02:51.797
when they see it.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.132
I know I can't do

02:51.839 --> 02:53.132
a job like that

02:53.172 --> 02:55.342
unless I give my life

02:53.172 --> 02:55.342
over to it, completely.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.511
Balance is important.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.553
Nick's important.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.682
Oh... I'm sorry.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.182
No, no, I got it.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.566
Oh! That's pretty.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.610
Yeah, it is.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.904
When I was little, before

03:13.652 --> 03:15.904
I lost my parents,

03:15.946 --> 03:16.864
we used to spend our summers

03:16.905 --> 03:18.949
at a cottage on the lake.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.408
Some of the best

03:18.991 --> 03:20.408
family memories I have.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.495
Hmm.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.461
My friend told me Middleton

03:29.417 --> 03:31.461
is a sleepy town.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.715
Peaceful, yes,

03:33.088 --> 03:34.715
but vibrant, too.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.841
Depends on what

03:34.756 --> 03:35.841
you're looking for.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.052
Peaceful.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.262
Hm. Cassie Nightingale.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.262
Welcome.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.015
Uh, can I take your bag up

03:41.304 --> 03:43.015
to your room?

03:43.057 --> 03:44.224
No! I'm good.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.019
Once you get settled in,

03:47.061 --> 03:50.564
I can go over all the

03:47.061 --> 03:50.564
activities that are going on

03:47.061 --> 03:50.564
in Middleton this week.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.941
Uh, something tells me you are

03:50.605 --> 03:52.941
not here for the sights.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.152
Just looking for some rest.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.653
I had a minor

03:55.194 --> 03:56.653
procedure recently.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.073
Nothing too serious.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.159
Just thought I'd take some

03:59.114 --> 04:02.159
time before going back

03:59.114 --> 04:02.159
to work.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.745
I tried staying at home,

04:02.201 --> 04:04.745
but I kept getting called in.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.996
There's no rest

04:04.786 --> 04:05.996
in the tech field.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.456
Something is always crashing

04:06.038 --> 04:08.456
or not working.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.751
Your room is down the hall,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.751
last door on the left.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.752
Ah, I'll show you.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.836
Nope, I've got it.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.004
Thanks.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.383
Well, I wish all our guests

04:16.006 --> 04:18.383
were like that.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.177
Quiet?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.887
Easy.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.015
Hm. Yes... Easy.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.237
-This is nice.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.237
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.240
Although, I feel the store

04:38.278 --> 04:41.240
isn't holding as much appeal

04:38.278 --> 04:41.240
as your phone.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.751
Brenda just sent out invites

04:50.373 --> 04:52.751
to her Sweet 16 party

04:52.793 --> 04:55.336
and now everyone is talking

04:52.793 --> 04:55.336
about who is and isn't

04:52.793 --> 04:55.336
invited.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.297
Hmm...

04:57.756 --> 04:58.966
I was.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.341
-That sounds fun.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.341
-Yeah!

05:01.593 --> 05:03.595
No.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.306
Those big parties kind of

05:03.637 --> 05:06.306
make me uncomfortable.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.849
Oh, well, how about something

05:06.347 --> 05:07.849
smaller?

05:07.891 --> 05:08.934
A movie night at Grey House?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.518
You could invite a few

05:08.976 --> 05:10.518
girlfriends.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.730
Yeah, or we could

05:10.560 --> 05:13.730
just hang out.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.857
Maybe we could make a batch

05:13.772 --> 05:15.857
of the snickerdoodle cookies.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.192
Sure, if that's what you want.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.319
Yeah, it is.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.158
Cassie!

05:24.199 --> 05:25.867
-Tom!

05:24.199 --> 05:25.867
-And Grace.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.035
Hi, Mr. Tinsdale.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.288
You are growing up

05:27.077 --> 05:29.288
so fast.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.538
You'll be off to college

05:29.329 --> 05:30.538
before you know it!

05:33.374 --> 05:36.335
Tom, I have

05:33.374 --> 05:36.335
something for you. Hmm...

05:38.588 --> 05:40.007
For your sinuses.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.340
How did you...

05:43.177 --> 05:45.846
Oh! Thanks.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.846
How much do I owe you?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.639
-Ten dollars.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.639
-Here.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.766
Thanks. Um...

05:49.808 --> 05:50.767
Don't forget your receipt.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.818
-Is there anything else?

05:58.733 --> 05:59.818
-Uh...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.071
I do need a present

06:01.278 --> 06:03.071
for Martha.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.948
Oh, your 30th anniversary.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.449
Yes.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.951
Oh! Do you have something

06:06.491 --> 06:07.951
special planned?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.287
-Should I?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.287
-Well, it'd be nice for

06:07.993 --> 06:10.287
both of you.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.289
Oh, it's more about Martha.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.499
She is very big

06:12.331 --> 06:14.499
on our anniversary.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.667
Hmm!

06:15.709 --> 06:18.295
Maybe you were thinking

06:15.709 --> 06:18.295
about something festive?

06:18.337 --> 06:20.255
"Festive"...

06:18.337 --> 06:20.255
You mean like a party?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.380
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.970
I had a party for Martha

06:24.259 --> 06:26.970
when we were first married.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.889
She worried so much

06:27.012 --> 06:28.889
about everything, she

06:27.012 --> 06:28.889
couldn't enjoy it.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.390
Well, what she doesn't know...

06:32.976 --> 06:34.102
A surprise?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.563
That's another great idea!

06:36.604 --> 06:38.397
Yeah, but I can't keep a

06:36.604 --> 06:38.397
secret that big from Martha.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.734
Hmm...

06:42.819 --> 06:44.445
No.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
No, I can't ask you

06:44.487 --> 06:46.365
to do it.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.949
Consider it a gift

06:46.405 --> 06:47.949
to both of you.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.370
Cassie Nightingale,

06:49.701 --> 06:51.370
you are an angel.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.163
Thank you.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.881
I can't find the spoons.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.176
Ice cream for lunch?

07:06.218 --> 07:09.888
It's a healthy snack

07:06.218 --> 07:09.888
full of calcium and...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
I just want a spoon.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.682
I rearranged everything.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.436
That's the third time

07:14.517 --> 07:16.436
this week.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.231
I'm not even going to mention

07:16.477 --> 07:19.231
what you did to my sock

07:16.477 --> 07:19.231
drawer.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.440
Look, I can tell you're bored.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.983
I am.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.443
Maybe you should think about

07:22.025 --> 07:23.443
going back to school sooner.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.029
I'll think about that,

07:26.071 --> 07:27.781
but in the meantime...

07:27.822 --> 07:29.074
You should find something

07:27.822 --> 07:29.074
to do.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.284
-Like a hobby?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.284
-Yeah.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.537
I saw this today.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.165
Community art classes.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.584
For adults. Beginners.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.379
Great! I think you should

07:39.626 --> 07:42.379
do it! It'll be good for you.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.381
And for the kitchen.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.381
And for me.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.465
And for my socks.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.466
(LAUGHS)

07:53.056 --> 07:56.017
You want me to cater

07:53.056 --> 07:56.017
an anniversary party for

07:53.056 --> 07:56.017
Martha?

07:56.059 --> 07:57.518
It wouldn't work without you.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.521
How many people? Passed hors

07:57.560 --> 08:00.521
d'oeuvres or multiple courses?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.857
You know what, I'll just work

08:00.563 --> 08:02.857
up a tasting menu

08:02.899 --> 08:05.110
and Martha can decide.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.110
I'll just give her a call.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.903
No, uh... Tom wants it

08:05.152 --> 08:06.903
to be a surprise.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.488
Oh! No problem.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.408
Are you sure about that?

08:11.450 --> 08:12.492
I can keep a secret.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.787
I can!

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
(BELLS CHIMING)

08:16.871 --> 08:18.081
Hey, Ben.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.833
Hey! I fixed the brackets

08:18.123 --> 08:19.833
for your shelf.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.501
-Oh!

08:19.874 --> 08:21.501
-This is a nice surprise.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.585
(GIGGLES)

08:22.627 --> 08:24.504
-So, what's up?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.504
-Oh, nothing.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.133
Cassie is planning a surprise

08:26.006 --> 08:28.133
anniversary party for Martha.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.426
-And I'm going to cater it.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.426
-Oh.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.512
What? It's not

08:30.593 --> 08:32.512
a surprise from Ben.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.014
Mmm-hmm.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.810
NICK: The deadline for

08:36.641 --> 08:38.810
the application is coming up.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.562
SAM: I'm still checking out

08:38.852 --> 08:41.562
the program.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.691
NICK: Greg said a semester

08:41.604 --> 08:44.691
abroad in London would be

08:41.604 --> 08:44.691
a great life experience.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.985
SAM: Nick, it's not

08:44.732 --> 08:46.985
a two-week vacation.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.862
It's four months

08:47.027 --> 08:48.862
in a foreign country.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.531
They all speak English.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.369
You're doing well in school.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.496
Right! I've

08:55.410 --> 08:57.496
totally earned this.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.747
-What if you fall behind?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.747
-I won't.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.583
Greg said that this is a once-

08:59.789 --> 09:02.583
in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.462
While I respect

09:02.625 --> 09:05.462
Greg's opinion,

09:05.504 --> 09:07.005
your life has just begun.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.089
You're gonna have

09:07.047 --> 09:08.089
lots of chances

09:08.131 --> 09:09.257
to do things like this.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.134
Most colleges have

09:09.299 --> 09:11.134
study abroad programs

09:11.176 --> 09:12.260
for juniors and seniors.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.971
Why won't you let me go?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.432
I need you to explain

09:15.013 --> 09:17.432
to me why you want to go.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.059
-I have.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.059
-Not really.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.101
Not in any detail.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.562
Maybe I could read

09:21.520 --> 09:22.562
your essay.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.817
The study abroad requires that

09:25.065 --> 09:27.817
you write a 1,000 word essay

09:27.859 --> 09:30.028
on why you want to take part

09:27.859 --> 09:30.028
in the London program.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.989
I think reading that

09:33.031 --> 09:34.324
might help me

09:33.031 --> 09:34.324
make my decision.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.214
I love your new hair.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.174
Thank you! I needed a change.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.009
Hmm.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.553
But you don't really want

09:53.051 --> 09:54.553
to talk about my hair, do you?

09:56.137 --> 09:57.597
Martha's party.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.392
-Stephanie.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.392
-(SIGHS)

10:00.434 --> 10:01.893
When it comes to gossip,

10:00.434 --> 10:01.893
that woman has more leaks

10:01.935 --> 10:03.228
than the Titanic.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.687
If you really want to keep

10:03.270 --> 10:04.687
it a surprise,

10:04.729 --> 10:06.189
cut her loose now.

10:06.231 --> 10:06.981
So, what do you say?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.277
Martha is so high maintenance.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.736
Yeah, but this is a surprise

10:10.318 --> 10:11.736
party,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.488
so Martha won't be

10:11.778 --> 10:13.488
involved in the planning.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.781
I'm really busy at the store.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.328
You really need my help,

10:17.784 --> 10:20.328
don't you?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.497
If you help Martha, you'll

10:20.370 --> 10:22.497
actually be helping yourself.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.333
I don't fall

10:23.706 --> 10:25.333
for reverse psychology.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.709
I know. It's your choice.

10:29.588 --> 10:30.630
Okay, fine.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.466
You won't regret it.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.594
Look, it's Alexis' brother...

10:35.635 --> 10:36.970
-Greg?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.970
-Mmm-hmm!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.807
-You haven't met him yet,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.807
have you?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.807
-No!

10:41.641 --> 10:43.435
Perfect. Greg!

10:49.316 --> 10:51.192
Hi! I don't believe

10:49.316 --> 10:51.192
you've met my cousin,

10:51.234 --> 10:52.527
Cassie Nightingale.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.489
Ah! It's nice to finally

10:52.569 --> 10:55.489
meet you. Alexis is a big fan.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.990
Aw, thank you.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.990
Send her my love.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.411
All right. I better

11:00.327 --> 11:01.411
get back to work.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.913
Don't be a stranger!

11:07.167 --> 11:08.835
-Okay, that is a first.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.835
-What?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.629
I've never had a man play

11:08.876 --> 11:10.629
hard to get before.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.840
-How do you deal with it?

11:12.213 --> 11:13.840
-Ah!

11:13.881 --> 11:15.550
-Abigail...

11:13.881 --> 11:15.550
-I'm just asking.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
CASSIE: He was just

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
in a hurry!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.012
Looks like you might just

11:17.177 --> 11:19.012
actually have to work

11:17.177 --> 11:19.012
for this one.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.181
That'll be a change.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.681
(LAUGHING)

11:24.267 --> 11:25.352
Something different.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.313
Could be fun!

11:28.355 --> 11:30.106
Maybe just what

11:28.355 --> 11:30.106
you're looking for.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.525
Or who I'm looking for.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.624
Aren't you cold?

11:48.291 --> 11:49.417
It helps me think.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.252
-About?

11:49.459 --> 11:51.252
-Everything.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.047
You care to elaborate?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.549
(LAUGHING)

11:55.590 --> 11:57.551
You know how we were

11:55.590 --> 11:57.551
horseback riding?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.802
It just reminded me how much

11:57.592 --> 11:59.802
I love the outdoors.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.638
You did seem at home

11:59.844 --> 12:01.638
in that saddle.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.099
Living in New York,

12:03.348 --> 12:05.099
working so much,

12:05.141 --> 12:05.933
I didn't get to do things

12:05.141 --> 12:05.933
like that.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.394
Mmm.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.854
And I didn't really miss it

12:07.435 --> 12:09.854
until I got out there again.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.730
Yeah, our connection to nature

12:09.896 --> 12:11.730
is very primal.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.732
It's in our DNA.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.443
Oddly, that makes sense.

12:16.027 --> 12:16.777
(LAUGHING)

12:17.987 --> 12:18.988
You know, the lake house?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.448
Yeah.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.534
The ad we saw in the paper.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.705
Maybe if I got a place like

12:22.576 --> 12:26.705
that, it'd be a way for Nick

12:22.576 --> 12:26.705
and me to get outside.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.707
You know. Do things together.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.707
Here.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.375
Like I did when I was his age.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.585
Sounds like

12:30.417 --> 12:31.585
you had an epiphany.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.211
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. I might have.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.713
(CHUCKLES)

12:34.753 --> 12:37.173
You know... You know a lot

12:34.753 --> 12:37.173
about the area.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.592
-Yeah.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.592
-Could you go with me?

12:38.633 --> 12:39.800
-Sure.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.800
-Great!

12:39.842 --> 12:41.344
I'll set something up for

12:39.842 --> 12:41.344
Sunday morning.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.137
-I'll call the agent and

12:41.386 --> 12:43.137
get a key.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.137
-Great!

12:43.179 --> 12:45.014
Yeah! It could be.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.474
Oh! I do have to be back

12:45.056 --> 12:46.474
early, though.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.059
I've got a lot of party

12:46.516 --> 12:48.059
planning to do.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.728
Ah!

12:49.768 --> 12:52.397
Martha's surprise

12:49.768 --> 12:52.397
anniversary party?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.982
Yeah, I hadn't told you

12:52.439 --> 12:54.982
about that yet.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.402
Oh, the guy

12:55.024 --> 12:57.402
at the food mart.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.237
He told Eve.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.237
And Stephanie told him.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.405
Ugh.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.780
So, are you coming?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.658
-Are you hosting?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.658
-I am.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.702
-At Grey House?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.702
-No!

13:05.744 --> 13:08.162
-Where then?

13:05.744 --> 13:08.162
-I don't know yet.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.456
Well, at least that part's

13:08.204 --> 13:09.456
still a surprise.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.542
-Mmm-hmm! (CHUCKLES)

13:11.374 --> 13:12.542
-See you!

13:21.800 --> 13:24.262
I am totally stressing

13:21.800 --> 13:24.262
about the menu for...

13:24.304 --> 13:25.138
(WHISPERING) Martha's party.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.767
What?

13:28.807 --> 13:30.101
Abigail's doing the flowers.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.561
Was I not

13:30.143 --> 13:31.561
supposed to tell Abigail?

13:31.603 --> 13:32.937
It's supposed to be a secret.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.522
Yeah, for Martha.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.316
No. You're not

13:34.564 --> 13:36.316
supposed to tell anyone.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.401
(SCOFFS) Well, Ben probably

13:36.357 --> 13:38.401
would have told her anyway.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.363
Oh.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.698
You look like a woman

13:42.405 --> 13:43.698
on a mission.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.158
I need answers.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.909
My anniversary is coming up.

13:46.951 --> 13:47.994
Oh.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.996
Oh. You have an anniversary?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.999
Yes. All married people do.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.167
Have you seen Tom lately?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.003
It is a small town,

13:57.044 --> 14:00.214
and in a small town, you are

13:57.044 --> 14:00.214
bound to run into people

13:57.044 --> 14:00.214
you know all the time.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.053
So, Tom hasn't mentioned

14:02.925 --> 14:06.053
our anniversary...

14:06.095 --> 14:08.264
That means either,

14:06.095 --> 14:08.264
A, he's forgotten,

14:08.306 --> 14:10.849
or B, he's planning something

14:08.306 --> 14:10.849
behind my back.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.686
You could just ask him.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.021
In our marriage,

14:15.062 --> 14:17.816
the duty of marking

14:15.062 --> 14:17.816
our anniversary has always

14:15.062 --> 14:17.816
been his responsibility.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.609
But it's both

14:17.856 --> 14:19.609
your anniversaries.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.530
Yes, but the responsibility

14:19.651 --> 14:23.530
for romance lies with the man.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.949
Well, I think keeping the

14:23.571 --> 14:26.949
romance alive is a shared

14:23.571 --> 14:26.949
responsibility.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.828
Well, we'll just have

14:26.991 --> 14:29.828
to agree to disagree.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
Just promise me

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
that if either of you

14:31.621 --> 14:33.748
hear anything from Tom,

14:31.621 --> 14:33.748
you'll let me know.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.878
See? I got this.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.884
So, are you going

14:43.508 --> 14:44.884
to Brenda's party?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.720
Uh... I don't think so.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.556
How's London going?

14:49.597 --> 14:51.766
I have to write an essay

14:49.597 --> 14:51.766
about why I want to go.

14:51.808 --> 14:52.933
That doesn't sound too bad.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.811
It's homework.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.855
Why do you want to go?

14:57.856 --> 15:00.316
I told you,

14:57.856 --> 15:00.316
because London is cool.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.235
And parent-free.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.488
You know, it rains almost

15:04.111 --> 15:05.488
half the year there.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.783
Yeah, I can deal with rain.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.202
One hundred and eighty

15:08.825 --> 15:11.202
days of rain?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.830
You'll be stuck inside a lot

15:11.244 --> 15:13.830
and you won't know anyone.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.122
But I'll be on my own.

15:15.164 --> 15:15.915
That's kind of my point.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.670
-Are you jealous

15:18.710 --> 15:20.670
that I'm going?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.670
-I'm not.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.257
I just want to make sure that

15:20.712 --> 15:24.257
you know what you're getting

15:20.712 --> 15:24.257
yourself into.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.926
I do.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.926
And I'll be fine.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.683
So wait, you got in trouble

15:30.221 --> 15:33.683
for what at your art class?

15:33.725 --> 15:36.227
For mixing our oils with

15:33.725 --> 15:36.227
the watercolors.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.937
-"Our" oils?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.937
-Donna.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.856
She's so much fun. We

15:37.978 --> 15:39.856
share a station.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.023
-Oh, nice!

15:39.898 --> 15:41.023
-Yeah.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.149
Her and her husband Chad

15:42.191 --> 15:43.192
own their own candy business.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.278
Huh.

15:45.319 --> 15:49.323
I can't remember if it's

15:45.319 --> 15:49.323
saltwater taffy or

15:45.319 --> 15:49.323
peanut brittle

15:49.365 --> 15:51.075
that got them started, but

15:49.365 --> 15:51.075
they have a whole store now.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.870
They are very well off.

15:53.912 --> 15:56.915
I think you'd really like

15:53.912 --> 15:56.915
Donna. And Chad sounds nice.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.792
You haven't met him.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.669
Which is why I wanted

15:58.833 --> 16:01.669
to invite both of them over.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.045
To get to know them better.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.840
We need to expand

16:03.087 --> 16:05.840
our circle of friends.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.717
Why? We have

16:05.882 --> 16:07.717
a very full circle.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.218
We don't.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.054
All our friends here are

16:09.260 --> 16:12.054
your friends or your family.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.348
Well, maybe we can meet them

16:12.096 --> 16:14.348
for dinner.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.893
I want to have them here.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.893
Entertain in our home.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.939
Or I could go back

16:19.186 --> 16:20.939
to rearranging the kitchen.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.983
Dinner sounds great.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.530
-(KNOCKING)

16:27.904 --> 16:29.530
-Hm?

16:29.572 --> 16:31.825
The representative from

16:29.572 --> 16:31.825
Hillcrest Hospital is here

16:29.572 --> 16:31.825
to see you.

16:31.866 --> 16:32.909
What?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.869
The representative

16:32.951 --> 16:34.869
from Hillcrest?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.329
I told them

16:34.911 --> 16:36.329
I wasn't interested.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.999
Well, what do you want me

16:38.832 --> 16:39.999
to tell them?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.877
Just send him back.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.715
What?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.467
It's not a "him."

16:49.509 --> 16:50.551
-It's a "her."

16:49.509 --> 16:50.551
-(SCOFFS)

16:50.593 --> 16:52.011
Well, send her back.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.721
Okay!

16:57.475 --> 16:58.643
I'll be out front

16:57.475 --> 16:58.643
if you need anything.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.020
Thank you, Eve.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.816
I'm Valerie Hanson,

17:03.105 --> 17:04.816
from Hillcrest.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.233
Hi. I'm...

17:06.275 --> 17:07.694
Dr. Samuel William Radford.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.822
Near perfect MCAT scores, top

17:07.735 --> 17:10.822
five of your graduating class,

17:10.864 --> 17:12.949
chief resident during

17:10.864 --> 17:12.949
your training, lead fellow,

17:12.991 --> 17:15.618
board-certified trauma surgeon

17:12.991 --> 17:15.618
and head of one of the busiest

17:15.660 --> 17:18.412
ERs in New York City

17:15.660 --> 17:18.412
for almost a decade.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.416
Hmm! And I told your boss

17:18.454 --> 17:22.416
I'm not interested.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.545
He's better at taking "no"

17:22.458 --> 17:25.545
for an answer than I am,

17:25.586 --> 17:28.088
which is why he does what

17:25.586 --> 17:28.088
he does, and I do what I do.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.258
-What do you do?

17:29.089 --> 17:31.258
-I'm a closer.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.093
(LAUGHING)

17:33.135 --> 17:36.138
Look. I'm flattered,

17:33.135 --> 17:36.138
but I'm happy here.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.598
Well, give me a chance

17:36.180 --> 17:37.598
to change your mind.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.393
I can spare 15 minutes.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.395
I only need five.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.732
Hey, you wanna see a movie

17:44.772 --> 17:45.732
tonight?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.400
Sure!

17:47.441 --> 17:48.818
So, I was thinking...

17:48.860 --> 17:50.945
-That I don't get to pick the

17:48.860 --> 17:50.945
movie?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.945
-(LAUGHS)

17:50.987 --> 17:53.990
Yeah. I am definitely tired

17:50.987 --> 17:53.990
of superheroes

17:54.032 --> 17:56.617
taking more than three hours

17:54.032 --> 17:56.617
to save the world.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.285
No matter how cute they

17:56.659 --> 17:58.285
happen to be.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.913
I see subtitles in my future.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.163
(LAUGHING)

18:01.205 --> 18:04.375
What I was thinking is

18:01.205 --> 18:04.375
that I can't ask Martha

18:04.417 --> 18:08.295
what kind of cake she would

18:04.417 --> 18:08.295
like, but you can.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.882
You could casually drop cake

18:08.337 --> 18:10.882
into a conversation.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.343
How do you casually drop cake

18:10.924 --> 18:14.343
into a conversation?

18:14.385 --> 18:17.179
What? Like, "Hey Martha, you

18:14.385 --> 18:17.179
need to winterize your pipes.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.973
"That makes me wonder

18:17.221 --> 18:18.973
what kind of cake you like."

18:19.015 --> 18:22.060
(LAUGHING) Okay. Point taken.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.561
Are you sure you want

18:22.101 --> 18:23.561
to do this?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.313
Yes. I love catering

18:23.603 --> 18:26.313
big parties.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.648
Why?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.484
Because you get to be a part

18:27.690 --> 18:30.484
of everyone's best moments.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.906
Weddings, anniversaries,

18:30.526 --> 18:34.906
birthdays, engagements...

18:34.948 --> 18:37.617
All the good and happy things

18:34.948 --> 18:37.617
in people's lives.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.619
That's why I want Martha's

18:37.658 --> 18:39.619
party to be perfect.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.121
You almost make it

18:40.912 --> 18:42.121
sound romantic.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.750
To me it is.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
I really think you should

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
reconsider opening a

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
catering business.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.545
I lost my investor.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.880
I remember that.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.382
But he isn't the only person

18:50.922 --> 18:53.382
that can invest.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.342
He's the only person I know.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.011
-I could find you an investor.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.011
-How?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.221
I have a lot of friends

18:58.304 --> 18:59.221
you don't know about.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.100
That's sweet.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.686
But let's just forget

19:02.141 --> 19:05.686
about it, okay?

19:19.617 --> 19:20.868
GEORGE: Fancy!

19:20.910 --> 19:23.245
Perfect for Madam Mayor.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.498
Tom wants the location

19:23.287 --> 19:25.498
to be very special.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.334
I don't see why you just

19:25.539 --> 19:28.334
don't have it here.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.252
Tom wants it to be someplace

19:28.375 --> 19:30.252
Martha's never been,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.839
so they can go back

19:30.294 --> 19:32.839
and enjoy the memories.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.256
Sounds like a lot of work.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.716
Hm. He loves her.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.468
That also sounds

19:35.758 --> 19:37.468
like a lot of work.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.138
(BANG)

19:56.904 --> 19:58.197
Dan... What is it?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.283
I...

20:03.661 --> 20:05.496
I was reading.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.496
I must have fallen asleep.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.790
Are you okay?

20:08.791 --> 20:09.792
No.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.586
No.

20:12.628 --> 20:13.921
You look like

20:12.628 --> 20:13.921
you've seen a ghost.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.051
I think I did.

20:31.772 --> 20:36.027
DAN: I was sound asleep

20:31.772 --> 20:36.027
until I heard this bang.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.445
I sat up in bed

20:36.069 --> 20:38.445
and that's when I saw her.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.739
The ghost?

20:39.780 --> 20:41.949
A shadowy figure

20:39.780 --> 20:41.949
in the corner of the room.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.576
What did she look like?

20:43.617 --> 20:46.079
She was young, pretty.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.123
But she looked sad.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.123
She didn't say anything,

20:49.165 --> 20:50.332
but she was looking

20:49.165 --> 20:50.332
right at me.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.087
I turned on the light

20:52.001 --> 20:54.087
and she was gone.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.629
Is everything all right

20:54.128 --> 20:55.629
in here?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.007
Dan, this is my son, Brandon.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.802
Look,

20:58.049 --> 21:01.802
I know what I sound like,

21:01.844 --> 21:04.138
and if I were you,

21:01.844 --> 21:04.138
I wouldn't believe me either,

21:04.180 --> 21:06.390
but I did see a ghost.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.309
She was as real

21:06.432 --> 21:09.309
as the three of you. I swear.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.229
A ghost?

21:11.270 --> 21:15.066
Have you ever had any reports

21:11.270 --> 21:15.066
of apparitions in the past?

21:15.108 --> 21:16.400
Last I checked,

21:16.442 --> 21:19.486
Grey House was

21:16.442 --> 21:19.486
apparition free.

21:19.528 --> 21:23.365
Yeah. Because, no offense,

21:19.528 --> 21:23.365
but ghosts aren't real.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.618
Well, when we see something

21:23.407 --> 21:25.618
out of the ordinary,

21:25.659 --> 21:27.203
it's a sign we need to

21:25.659 --> 21:27.203
pay attention.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.207
Don't worry. We will get to

21:29.580 --> 21:31.207
the bottom of this.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.374
I promise.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.090
I think we should

21:36.003 --> 21:39.090
switch your room.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.424
-Thank you.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.424
-I'll have

21:39.132 --> 21:40.424
George bring up a key.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.770
You're not buying

21:50.476 --> 21:52.770
this ghost stuff, are you?

21:53.604 --> 21:55.355
The guy is off his rocker.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.732
I mean, if you said

21:56.774 --> 21:58.317
you saw something,

21:56.774 --> 21:58.317
that's one thing.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.403
But you are you.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.157
Just because we can't see

22:01.445 --> 22:04.157
something doesn't mean

22:01.445 --> 22:04.157
it isn't there.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.701
Okay. But you should keep

22:05.532 --> 22:07.701
an eye on that guy.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.703
I get a funny feeling.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.747
Done. And agreed.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.582
Now, as much as I'd love

22:11.789 --> 22:13.582
to stand around chatting

22:13.624 --> 22:16.169
about nonexistent ghosts,

22:13.624 --> 22:16.169
Tara sent me here for...

22:17.628 --> 22:19.672
For my chicken vindaloo?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.257
She's planning a dinner party.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.300
She's keeping busy.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.137
Looks like you two are

22:24.260 --> 22:26.137
planning something as well.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.681
Yeah! Tom enlisted

22:26.179 --> 22:28.681
me to plan

22:28.722 --> 22:30.766
a surprise anniversary party

22:28.722 --> 22:30.766
for Martha. We were thinking

22:30.808 --> 22:32.810
about the restaurant

22:30.808 --> 22:32.810
overlooking the golf course.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.312
-Jack's.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.312
-Impossible.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.522
Not the restaurant.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.692
But keeping a secret from

22:36.563 --> 22:39.692
Martha? She'll smell that

22:36.563 --> 22:39.692
a mile away.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.819
Well, then we'll just all have

22:39.733 --> 22:41.819
to go the extra mile.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.197
Thanks.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.790
Thank you so much.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.378
Hey!

23:01.588 --> 23:03.381
-What's this?

23:01.588 --> 23:03.381
-Lunch.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.467
Well, thank you!

23:05.509 --> 23:06.927
Do you want to share?

23:06.969 --> 23:08.095
Oh! I thought you'd never ask.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.596
(LAUGHS)

23:09.638 --> 23:11.598
There is...

23:11.640 --> 23:13.226
Two of everything

23:11.640 --> 23:13.226
in here.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.394
What? Is there? That's weird!

23:20.149 --> 23:21.734
Okay. Let's see.

23:24.778 --> 23:25.821
Lahmacun?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.405
With beetroot.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.283
And homemade.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.827
Oh, there's a vegan restaurant

23:29.325 --> 23:31.827
by the college run by this

23:29.325 --> 23:31.827
family from Turkey.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.204
Very authentic.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.039
-Reminds me of...

23:33.246 --> 23:35.039
-Istanbul.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.124
Uh-huh.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.459
So, I thought

23:37.166 --> 23:39.459
of you the other day.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.212
-I was rock climbing.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.212
-Oh. Cedar bluff?

23:41.837 --> 23:42.880
Rocky Hollow.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.672
It's beautiful up there.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.841
Yeah. When's

23:44.840 --> 23:45.841
the last time you went?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.802
Ages. To be honest,

23:48.844 --> 23:51.471
no one in my immediate circle

23:48.844 --> 23:51.471
likes to hike.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.141
Hiking is meant for patient

23:51.513 --> 23:54.141
souls not needing a quick fix.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.310
-Hm.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.310
-I was in Scotland

23:54.183 --> 23:56.310
before this.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.730
The Isle of Skye...

23:56.352 --> 23:59.730
Life changing.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.983
Yeah. There is nothing like

23:59.772 --> 24:02.983
standing alone surrounded

23:59.772 --> 24:02.983
by nature.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.693
It helps you understand

24:03.025 --> 24:04.693
your place in the universe.

24:04.735 --> 24:06.653
Helps you

24:04.735 --> 24:06.653
understand the world.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.947
Most people like to know

24:06.695 --> 24:07.947
where they're going.

24:07.988 --> 24:11.951
But me, I like not knowing my

24:07.988 --> 24:11.951
destination until I get there.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.370
-You used to love that too.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.370
-I still do.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.372
-Then come with me sometime.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.372
-Hiking?

24:16.414 --> 24:19.875
Yeah! I found a place at the

24:16.414 --> 24:19.875
park, near some waterfalls,

24:16.414 --> 24:19.875
peaceful, beautiful...

24:19.917 --> 24:21.127
Altar Falls?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.253
No.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.630
I know this area pretty well.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.675
Well, I think there are

24:26.340 --> 24:28.675
things around here

24:28.717 --> 24:30.344
that you haven't seen, even

24:28.717 --> 24:30.344
though you think you have.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.471
Maybe Middleton can still

24:31.720 --> 24:33.471
surprise you too.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.477
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

24:41.563 --> 24:43.065
I still can't believe

24:41.563 --> 24:43.065
you got me here.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.234
-Persistence.

24:43.107 --> 24:45.234
-I said no to lunch.

24:45.276 --> 24:48.486
This isn't lunch. I just

24:45.276 --> 24:48.486
wanted you to see your

24:45.276 --> 24:48.486
new office.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.780
Not my office.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.782
I know you're the right man

24:49.822 --> 24:51.782
for the job.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.866
And I always get my man.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.952
Professionally speaking.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.372
Well, the job is

24:55.911 --> 24:58.372
very intriguing.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.082
And the office is nice too.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.292
I'm glad to hear that.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.627
But I've got my practice

25:01.334 --> 25:03.627
to think of.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.339
And being the only doctor in

25:03.669 --> 25:06.339
Middleton, I have to think

25:03.669 --> 25:06.339
of the town too.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.882
I can't abandon it,

25:06.380 --> 25:08.882
or them.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.844
Understandable. But maybe

25:08.924 --> 25:11.844
we can find a way to work

25:08.924 --> 25:11.844
around that.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.511
I also have a son who's going

25:11.885 --> 25:13.511
to college soon.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.806
Oh. I have a son too!

25:15.848 --> 25:17.766
But he's 12, not quite ready

25:15.848 --> 25:17.766
to leave the nest.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.353
I have to ask,

25:20.394 --> 25:21.854
are the teen years as bad

25:20.394 --> 25:21.854
as they say they are?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.563
(LAUGHING)

25:23.605 --> 25:25.483
There are ups and downs.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.318
But Nick's doing

25:25.523 --> 25:27.318
great right now,

25:27.360 --> 25:29.403
and I want to spend as much

25:27.360 --> 25:29.403
time with him as possible.

25:29.445 --> 25:32.614
But if your son's going to

25:29.445 --> 25:32.614
college soon, you might want

25:29.445 --> 25:32.614
to secure something

25:32.656 --> 25:34.532
that will allow you to ramp up

25:32.656 --> 25:34.532
your career in the future.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.123
The next step would be

25:38.204 --> 25:41.123
to meet some of my colleagues.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.540
Would you like to take

25:41.165 --> 25:42.540
the next step?

25:43.459 --> 25:44.668
Hmm...

25:49.340 --> 25:51.050
CASSIE: I have a feeling

25:51.091 --> 25:54.803
that Martha would like

25:51.091 --> 25:54.803
hydrangeas and baby roses.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.554
I saw her wedding photo,

25:54.845 --> 25:56.554
and she had that bouquet.

25:57.515 --> 25:58.516
(CHUCKLES)

26:02.144 --> 26:03.396
What are you up to?

26:03.437 --> 26:05.314
You do seem preoccupied.

26:05.356 --> 26:06.524
I'm just sitting here.

26:06.606 --> 26:07.565
Looking for someone?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.567
No one in particular.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.571
ABIGAIL: Oh look!

26:11.778 --> 26:13.571
There's Greg.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.410
Well, it would be rude

26:15.615 --> 26:17.410
to not say hello.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.576
And you are never rude.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.788
Hey there!

26:22.540 --> 26:24.458
Hello.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.583
We seem to keep running

26:24.500 --> 26:25.583
into each other.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.627
Yeah, we do.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.587
Maybe we should make a plan

26:27.669 --> 26:29.587
to run into each other?

26:30.714 --> 26:31.673
I like that idea.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.009
How about lunch?

26:34.051 --> 26:35.052
I love lunch.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.388
Me too.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.473
We just met and we have so

26:37.430 --> 26:39.473
much in common already.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.519
I almost feel sorry for him.

26:44.686 --> 26:47.356
I think he's exactly

26:44.686 --> 26:47.356
what Abigail needs.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.982
GREG: Yeah, how about 12:30?

26:53.820 --> 26:54.947
Hey!

26:56.198 --> 26:57.199
Working on your essay?

26:57.241 --> 27:00.202
Uh, yeah.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.619
I can't wait to read it.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.250
Hey, I am...

27:06.292 --> 27:08.127
Going to look at a lake house

27:06.292 --> 27:08.127
tomorrow.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.627
For what?

27:10.879 --> 27:12.298
For us.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.049
You want to buy a lake house?

27:14.091 --> 27:16.676
Well, yeah, I thought it would

27:14.091 --> 27:16.676
be fun to have a vacation

27:14.091 --> 27:16.676
place for the weekends.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.636
-To do what?

27:16.718 --> 27:18.636
-Well, I don't know!

27:19.096 --> 27:20.431
Fish, jet ski,

27:20.473 --> 27:21.557
hang out on a boat.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.435
I guess that'd be

27:22.640 --> 27:24.435
kind of cool.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.439
Especially if you get it

27:28.481 --> 27:29.689
before I go to London.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.865
(KNOCKING)

27:38.907 --> 27:40.033
I brought you some tea.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.368
My favorite!

27:41.410 --> 27:42.536
-Mmm-hmm.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.536
-Thanks, Mom.

27:42.578 --> 27:43.870
Sure. There you go.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.040
-So, how are things going?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.040
-Oh, great.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.208
-Yeah?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.208
-Yeah, actually,

27:48.250 --> 27:51.253
I forgot to tell you. I aced

27:48.250 --> 27:51.253
my lab in honors biology.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.797
Great! Nice.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.797
And what about Sam's office?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.592
I love it there.

27:56.634 --> 27:59.845
Eve is so nice and Sam,

27:56.634 --> 27:59.845
he's a really good doctor.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.431
-And it's not too much with

27:59.886 --> 28:02.431
school?

27:59.886 --> 28:02.431
-No, no!

28:02.473 --> 28:05.559
And don't worry! I am totally

28:02.473 --> 28:05.559
on track to getting

28:02.473 --> 28:05.559
straight A's again.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.354
Well, grades are important,

28:08.395 --> 28:11.148
but there are other aspects to

28:08.395 --> 28:11.148
school, like hanging out

28:08.395 --> 28:11.148
with friends.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.733
No, I know.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.528
I just haven't really been up

28:13.775 --> 28:15.528
to doing that lately.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.447
Is there a problem?

28:18.489 --> 28:19.739
Some of the girls at school?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.117
No. Really. Everyone is fine.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.454
Well, I can tell that

28:23.994 --> 28:25.454
there is something...

28:28.374 --> 28:29.707
Well, I mean,

28:30.376 --> 28:31.544
Nick might go to London.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.964
And Lori is away

28:33.253 --> 28:35.964
on assignment in LA.

28:36.006 --> 28:38.509
Brandon and Tara are totally

28:36.006 --> 28:38.509
into that baby thing.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.302
Eve said Sam might take the

28:38.551 --> 28:40.302
job at the hospital...

28:40.344 --> 28:42.888
And, I mean, Abigail...

28:42.929 --> 28:44.764
If it's not her job,

28:42.929 --> 28:44.764
it's another guy, so...

28:47.560 --> 28:48.852
-I'm here.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.852
-No, I know.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.064
But you have

28:50.479 --> 28:52.064
Bell, Book &amp; Candle,

28:53.399 --> 28:54.733
and all of the guests...

28:56.527 --> 28:58.529
Do you feel like you and I

28:56.527 --> 28:58.529
don't spend enough time

28:56.527 --> 28:58.529
together?

29:00.072 --> 29:00.906
It's just...

29:02.658 --> 29:05.703
We aren't all together

29:02.658 --> 29:05.703
like we used to be.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.247
Everyone is kind

29:06.870 --> 29:08.247
of doing their own thing.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.918
We could make cookies.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.086
And watch a movie. Just us.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.422
I'd love to.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.632
But biology calls.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.842
Right. Okay.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.429
-Love you.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.429
-I love you.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.685
And if you change your mind,

29:26.473 --> 29:29.685
I'm here.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.687
I know that. Thanks.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.418
So, I met with the hospital

29:52.082 --> 29:54.418
administrator for Hillcrest.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.502
Oh! How was it?

29:55.544 --> 29:56.545
She's intense.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.423
And she was in full sell mode.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.841
She came by the

29:59.465 --> 30:01.841
office unannounced,

29:59.465 --> 30:01.841
and before I knew it,

30:01.883 --> 30:04.219
I had agreed to meet with her

30:01.883 --> 30:04.219
at the hospital the next day.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.804
They know you'd do

30:04.261 --> 30:05.804
an amazing job.

30:05.845 --> 30:06.930
It is a great opportunity,

30:06.972 --> 30:08.223
I just don't know how I could

30:06.972 --> 30:08.223
do that job

30:08.265 --> 30:10.809
and spend any time with Nick,

30:08.265 --> 30:10.809
let alone keep my practice.

30:11.893 --> 30:12.936
Keeping a balance is

30:11.893 --> 30:12.936
a challenge.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.813
Yeah. It is.

30:20.611 --> 30:21.945
CASSIE: Why are you stopping?

30:21.987 --> 30:24.698
That's the third time

30:21.987 --> 30:24.698
I passed those signs.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.199
I just made a

30:24.740 --> 30:26.199
huge circle again.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.326
Oh. You did?

30:27.367 --> 30:28.661
I don't think

30:27.367 --> 30:28.661
these directions are right.

30:28.702 --> 30:29.953
There's no Forestview Drive.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.207
Eve's use of the map app is

30:31.955 --> 30:34.207
questionable.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.417
(LAUGHING) What about

30:34.249 --> 30:35.417
your phone?

30:37.294 --> 30:38.378
No signal.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.674
We are off the grid. In a way.

30:41.715 --> 30:45.010
Well, maybe that's

30:41.715 --> 30:45.010
the sign to turn back.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.845
No. You're definitely going

30:45.051 --> 30:46.845
the right way.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.182
Here.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.308
May I see that?

30:56.772 --> 30:59.899
It's about a mile ahead,

30:56.772 --> 30:59.899
that way.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.901
So you take a left

30:59.941 --> 31:01.901
and then the first right.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.530
You got that from this?

31:04.571 --> 31:05.572
I did!

31:07.407 --> 31:09.284
That's definitely a sign

31:07.407 --> 31:09.284
we should keep going.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.375
Ahem!

31:26.719 --> 31:30.222
Okay, Mr. Quiet.

31:26.719 --> 31:30.222
What is up with you?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.391
Nothing.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.394
Have you started

31:33.809 --> 31:35.394
your London essay?

31:37.103 --> 31:38.647
If by "starting" you mean

31:38.689 --> 31:40.232
opening up my laptop,

31:38.689 --> 31:40.232
then...

31:41.191 --> 31:41.983
Yeah.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.695
Well, don't worry.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.904
It's always hard

31:44.737 --> 31:45.904
to begin a paper.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.534
I don't see why I need

31:47.280 --> 31:50.534
to write a huge essay anyway.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.578
They probably just want to

31:50.576 --> 31:52.578
make sure that you've

31:50.576 --> 31:52.578
done your research,

31:52.619 --> 31:54.287
on London and the program.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.831
(SIGHS)

31:55.873 --> 31:56.998
Did you know that London is

31:55.873 --> 31:56.998
six hours ahead?

31:57.957 --> 32:00.085
Yes!

32:00.126 --> 32:02.671
It might make it hard to Skype

32:00.126 --> 32:02.671
with people back home.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.214
And it's an eight-hour

32:02.713 --> 32:04.214
school day over there.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.925
Challenging.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.261
Seriously, who does school

32:06.966 --> 32:09.261
for eight hours?

32:09.845 --> 32:10.970
Well, you!

32:11.471 --> 32:12.598
If you go.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.270
You do still want

32:16.518 --> 32:18.270
to go, right?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.523
Yeah.

32:22.524 --> 32:23.859
Absolutely.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.193
Hmm!

32:43.420 --> 32:44.546
I'm glad

32:43.420 --> 32:44.546
we stayed with it.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.632
-It is stunning! Wow!

32:44.588 --> 32:46.632
-(CHUCKLES)

32:48.967 --> 32:50.343
Do you want to start

32:48.967 --> 32:50.343
with the boathouse?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.428
I do. Yeah.

32:52.888 --> 32:53.847
SAM: Beautiful part

32:52.888 --> 32:53.847
of the lake.

32:53.889 --> 32:54.890
CASSIE: It's gorgeous.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.651
This isn't the way

33:04.065 --> 33:05.651
to the bistro.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.277
No, I wanted to show you

33:05.692 --> 33:07.277
something.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.821
I think this

33:07.319 --> 33:08.821
would be a great place

33:08.862 --> 33:09.988
for your catering business.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.407
Oh!

33:12.449 --> 33:15.285
Ben... I don't have the money

33:12.449 --> 33:15.285
to do it by myself.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.746
I found you an investor.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.748
You what?

33:19.790 --> 33:20.791
Surprised?

33:21.583 --> 33:22.584
(CHUCKLES)

33:58.620 --> 33:59.746
Nice.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.333
The people are selling

34:01.957 --> 34:03.333
it all,

34:03.375 --> 34:05.919
so I get the boat,

34:03.375 --> 34:05.919
the jet skis, everything.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.048
-Nick's going to flip.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.048
-Yeah.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.972
So, this is your first

34:15.136 --> 34:16.972
year teaching?

34:17.014 --> 34:19.057
Yeah, I was working

34:17.014 --> 34:19.057
for my family's foundation.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.267
They believe in giving back.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.143
Oh!

34:22.811 --> 34:23.812
Me too.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.400
I've just been so

34:25.981 --> 34:28.400
busy with my flower shop,

34:28.441 --> 34:31.528
that I haven't had time

34:28.441 --> 34:31.528
to do any real volunteer work.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.863
Business is booming.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.198
You just opened.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.198
That's so fast.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.074
I have a way with people.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.284
How so?

34:38.326 --> 34:39.411
I was able to persuade

34:39.452 --> 34:41.580
a lot of people that my flower

34:39.452 --> 34:41.580
shop was a good idea,

34:41.621 --> 34:43.373
and then things just

34:41.621 --> 34:43.373
fell into place.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.167
-"Persuade"?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.167
-Yeah.

34:46.209 --> 34:50.213
My investor, my realtor, the

34:46.209 --> 34:50.213
mayor expedited my license.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.262
Well, you certainly had

34:55.844 --> 34:57.262
a way with my sister.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.182
I have a way at

34:58.972 --> 35:01.182
swaying people

35:01.224 --> 35:03.393
to get them to do things

35:01.224 --> 35:03.393
the way that I want.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.896
I can see that.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.443
I'm just gonna go

35:10.149 --> 35:11.443
take care of this.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.831
CASSIE: This looks

35:22.913 --> 35:24.831
like the original wood.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.374
Yeah, they did a lot

35:24.873 --> 35:26.374
of renovations,

35:26.416 --> 35:29.127
but they tried to use as much

35:26.416 --> 35:29.127
original material as possible.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.881
Someone really loved

35:30.712 --> 35:32.881
this place.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.424
-I really love this place.

35:32.923 --> 35:34.424
-Yeah!

35:36.259 --> 35:38.470
I'll probably have the pipes

35:36.259 --> 35:38.470
checked, though.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.930
Yeah. If they're not copper,

35:39.972 --> 35:41.098
they might need

35:39.972 --> 35:41.098
to be replaced.

35:43.266 --> 35:45.978
Remind me to show you pictures

35:43.266 --> 35:45.978
of Grey House when I first

35:43.266 --> 35:45.978
got to town.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.396
Let's just say,

35:46.019 --> 35:48.396
I am fluent in "old home."

35:48.438 --> 35:49.606
(CHUCKLES) Your seventh

35:48.438 --> 35:49.606
language?

35:49.648 --> 35:50.690
Yeah, I guess so.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.116
So what do you think?

35:59.157 --> 36:00.742
It might need a

35:59.157 --> 36:00.742
little updating, but...

36:00.784 --> 36:02.619
Most things benefit

36:00.784 --> 36:02.619
from a bit of renewal, right?

36:03.954 --> 36:05.163
I'm not much of a renovator,

36:05.204 --> 36:06.247
I'm more of a

36:06.289 --> 36:08.083
"buy it already done"

36:06.289 --> 36:08.083
kind of guy.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.835
Yeah, but it's got it all.

36:10.418 --> 36:11.962
What?

36:12.004 --> 36:14.255
The potential

36:12.004 --> 36:14.255
for a beautiful retreat,

36:14.297 --> 36:16.466
and a place for you and Nick

36:14.297 --> 36:16.466
to create memories.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.468
I'd be willing to help.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.887
You would?

36:20.929 --> 36:22.973
Yeah! I think my energy and

36:20.929 --> 36:22.973
effort would be well spent.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.766
And appreciated.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.185
Very much appreciated.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.702
-Dan...

36:41.867 --> 36:43.702
-I'm exhausted.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.871
Oh, I'm so sorry.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.581
Every time I doze off,

36:45.912 --> 36:48.581
I get this feeling

36:48.623 --> 36:51.126
and then I jolt up

36:48.623 --> 36:51.126
and I see the ghost again.

36:51.168 --> 36:53.294
The same woman

36:51.168 --> 36:53.294
from your first room?

36:53.336 --> 36:55.881
I think so.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.881
Has this happened before?

36:55.922 --> 36:57.090
No, never.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.717
(SIGHS) But this is an old

36:57.132 --> 36:58.717
house.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.553
-It is.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.553
-And old houses...

37:01.594 --> 37:04.890
Well, did something happen

37:01.594 --> 37:04.890
with a woman who lived here?

37:04.931 --> 37:07.225
I can assure you, Grey House

37:04.931 --> 37:07.225
doesn't have that kind

37:04.931 --> 37:07.225
of energy.

37:07.642 --> 37:08.643
(SIGHS)

37:09.435 --> 37:10.228
The ghost is back?

37:11.813 --> 37:12.856
I'm going to check out.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.982
Maybe that's best.

37:14.024 --> 37:16.151
No. You're too tired to drive.

37:16.193 --> 37:19.362
Stay another night. Please.

37:16.193 --> 37:19.362
I think this is where

37:16.193 --> 37:19.362
you need to be.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.614
(SIGHS) Just one more night.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.914
If he starts walking around

37:26.870 --> 37:28.914
at breakfast saying he saw

37:28.955 --> 37:32.042
dead people, he's going

37:28.955 --> 37:32.042
to frighten our guests.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.251
Present and future.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.129
Face it,

37:36.171 --> 37:37.338
that guy needs

37:36.171 --> 37:37.338
professional help.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.425
He does.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.266
What are you doing here

37:47.182 --> 37:48.266
on Sunday?

37:49.684 --> 37:50.560
Catching up.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.771
How was the lake house?

37:52.812 --> 37:55.774
Nice! Really nice.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.774
I'm considering it.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.610
By the way... Valerie called.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.113
Hmm...

38:01.154 --> 38:03.364
I heard the hospital

38:01.154 --> 38:03.364
really wants you.

38:03.406 --> 38:04.532
I am very well-informed.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.451
I don't doubt it.

38:08.078 --> 38:10.455
Are you also considering

38:08.078 --> 38:10.455
taking the job?

38:11.039 --> 38:12.665
I told her no,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.209
but it looks like they're

38:12.707 --> 38:14.209
still considering me,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.209
doesn't it?

38:24.886 --> 38:25.971
Well, you look nice.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.973
Thank you.

38:28.014 --> 38:28.848
Is that our wedding china?

38:28.890 --> 38:30.349
Yeah.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.018
Don't you think

38:30.391 --> 38:32.018
that it's maybe a bit much?

38:32.060 --> 38:34.312
I just want the Bryants

38:32.060 --> 38:34.312
to feel comfortable.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.773
Do they need china to feel

38:34.353 --> 38:36.773
comfortable?

38:36.815 --> 38:39.317
Why did we register for them

38:36.815 --> 38:39.317
if we weren't going to use

38:36.815 --> 38:39.317
them?

38:39.358 --> 38:40.735
I'm a guy... I don't know.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.320
(CHUCKLES)

38:42.361 --> 38:43.863
And... Are you wearing that?

38:48.367 --> 38:49.869
We're using our good china.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.454
Yeah.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.332
I just think

38:51.496 --> 38:54.332
that shirt is a little casual.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.793
So, because of the dishes,

38:54.373 --> 38:56.793
I have to change my shirt?

38:57.669 --> 38:58.670
Only if you want to.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.339
I'll go change.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.802
(BELL RINGS)

39:06.761 --> 39:07.804
They're here!

39:10.015 --> 39:11.349
I'll get it.

39:13.893 --> 39:14.936
Tara!

39:16.980 --> 39:18.940
Welcome, both of you!

39:18.982 --> 39:20.566
-Hi. You must be Chad.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.566
-Hey!

39:20.608 --> 39:22.235
-Yeah. Nice to meet you

39:20.608 --> 39:22.235
-Donna.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.820
-Hello.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.820
-Brandon.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.283
Oh wow! These are

39:25.030 --> 39:28.283
too pretty to eat.

39:28.325 --> 39:29.701
You're going to love the

39:28.325 --> 39:29.701
chocolate-laced lollipops.

39:30.910 --> 39:31.828
Do I smell baked brie?

39:31.870 --> 39:32.996
Yeah.

39:34.956 --> 39:36.582
So... You're in the candy

39:34.956 --> 39:36.582
business.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.584
Yes.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.128
Are you a grad student

39:38.626 --> 39:40.128
like Tara?

39:40.170 --> 39:41.379
-I'm a cop.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.379
-Cool!

39:44.341 --> 39:45.717
-You want a drink?

39:44.341 --> 39:45.717
-Absolutely.

39:45.758 --> 39:46.759
All right.

39:50.722 --> 39:54.433
Yoo-hoo! I just need

39:50.722 --> 39:54.433
some flowers for my office.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.434
Okay.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.896
So...

39:57.937 --> 39:59.356
Had any big orders

39:59.397 --> 40:00.815
from my husband lately?

40:00.857 --> 40:02.275
(SIGHS) No...

40:02.317 --> 40:04.861
Oh. Oh!

40:04.903 --> 40:06.238
I love this.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.241
You can't have that one.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.241
It's for Cassie's par...

40:10.825 --> 40:12.369
"Par"?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.080
As in "party"? As in Cassie's

40:12.410 --> 40:15.080
having a party?

40:16.164 --> 40:17.498
A party I don't know about?

40:24.005 --> 40:25.298
John?

40:26.799 --> 40:27.592
George let me in.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.802
Are you ready for our hike?

40:31.179 --> 40:33.181
We didn't make plans.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.182
When do

40:33.223 --> 40:34.182
we ever need plans?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.309
It's late.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.227
Which is why we should

40:36.351 --> 40:37.227
leave now,

40:37.269 --> 40:38.436
so we don't miss the sunset.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.437
John...

40:40.563 --> 40:42.190
Are you free now?

40:42.232 --> 40:43.983
-Yes.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.983
-Well, then be free.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.985
Come with me.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.320
What's the worst

40:46.027 --> 40:47.320
that could happen?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.364
Oh. We end up

40:47.362 --> 40:49.364
hiking in the dark.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.784
I'm not afraid of the dark,

40:50.489 --> 40:52.784
are you?

40:52.825 --> 40:54.035
I always had trouble

40:52.825 --> 40:54.035
saying no to you.

40:54.827 --> 40:55.870
So don't.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.958
All right, let's go.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.584
Now that's the Cassie

40:59.999 --> 41:01.584
Nightingale I know.
