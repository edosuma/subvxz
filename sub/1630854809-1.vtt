01:18.687 --> 01:20.341
Automated voice:
<i>Rejuvenation commenced.</i>

01:22.386 --> 01:24.171
<i>Compression suits activated.</i>

01:31.830 --> 01:34.050
There'’s been a breach.
We gotta get everyone
out of the bay.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.573
- What happened?
- Hell if I know.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.064
Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.125
Oh, Susan! Susan, no!

02:13.089 --> 02:16.223
The room is collapsing!
Go, go!

02:16.223 --> 02:19.226
Everybody, get in!
Get in there!

02:19.226 --> 02:21.315
Secure your helmets
until we stabilize!

02:21.315 --> 02:23.230
- Come on, move! Move!
- Get in there!

02:23.230 --> 02:24.709
Get your helmets!

02:32.282 --> 02:35.503
Secure your helmets
until we stabilize!

02:43.772 --> 02:45.861
Trent! Trent, come on,
we have to go!

02:45.861 --> 02:47.254
The bay'’s imploding.
We have to go.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.038
- No! Please, I gotta try!
- Trent.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.279
- Come on.
- No!

03:12.279 --> 03:13.497
No.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.748
Oh, no.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.069
Where the hell are we going?

05:31.069 --> 05:32.636
We need to speak
to our commanding officers,

05:32.636 --> 05:34.290
- find out what just happened.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.074
We'’re going to the commanding
officers'’ cryo bay?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.685
I'’m not waking up
Captain Lester.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.122
I think this more than qualifies
as sufficient emergency.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.519
Seriously?

05:45.519 --> 05:46.694
Fine, I'’ll wake her up.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.892
When in God'’s name will someone
tell us what happened?

06:10.892 --> 06:12.676
I heard a fuel tank exploded.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.678
Yeah, I heard
we hit an asteroid.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.985
But I'’d like someone
from command to brief us.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.944
Please do not spread
unsubstantiated rumors.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.468
I'’m sure we will know
when they know.

06:21.468 --> 06:25.297
Until then,
we follow protocol.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.517
Excuse me.
Is this Med Bay 12?

06:27.517 --> 06:29.911
- I was messaged to report to--
- Group 3, you'’re late.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.129
Get on the table over there

06:31.129 --> 06:32.479
and get out of
your compression suit.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.529
I said table first,
then suit.

06:39.529 --> 06:42.097
- My legs!
- You'’ve been in
a cryogenic state

06:42.097 --> 06:44.708
for a long time.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.710
A certain amount
of muscle atrophy occurs

06:46.710 --> 06:48.190
even while wearing the suit.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.931
Will I ever get my legs back?

06:49.931 --> 06:53.587
My God, man,
did you pay no attention
during orientation?

06:53.587 --> 06:56.154
There was a lot to take in.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.505
You'’ll be out of your suit
and on your feet soon

06:58.505 --> 07:00.332
if you make all
your rehab appointments.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.944
- Okay.
- On time.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.990
James Brice?
Is there a Lieutenant
James Brice in here?

07:07.339 --> 07:08.993
Aye.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.955
You'’re wanted on Cent-Com, stat.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.479
Well, I'’m assigned
to navigation.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.177
I haven'’t worked Cent-Com
since I was a wee lad.

07:19.177 --> 07:22.267
- Today you work Cent-Com.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.313
Lieutenant, just like you.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.315
Lieutenant?

07:38.240 --> 07:40.547
So how can I help you,
Lieutenant?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
We can'’t access the flight log
and cam recordings.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.420
We need to know what happened,
what our status is,

07:44.420 --> 07:46.596
- but we'’re locked out.
- Look, I'’ll be honest.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.425
I don'’t even know
if I remember
how it works, Cent-Com.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.557
I mean,
shouldn'’t Mayweather
be doing this?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.428
He practically lives
for this shit.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.999
Mayweather is dead,
along with everyone else

07:57.999 --> 07:59.609
in the commanding
officers'’ cryo bay.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.148
That must be the last load.
I have no charges left.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.761
Any word from command
about what happened?

08:21.979 --> 08:24.373
No one knows nothing.

08:24.373 --> 08:27.071
I'’m going to need more
refill tanks for the helmets.

08:27.071 --> 08:30.292
- Good for you.
- You'’re life support system!
You get them for me.

08:33.643 --> 08:38.169
Fetching canisters
is below my paygrade, comrade.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.128
I'’m Serbian, you moron.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.827
You certainly are.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.137
I was so worried I lost you.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.573
You wanna put us in trouble?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.488
I didn'’t know
what was happening,

08:52.488 --> 08:54.272
where you were,
or even if you were alive.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.405
If someone was to see us,
start poking around...

08:56.405 --> 09:00.148
I mean, does that
even matter anymore?
We'’re on the ship now.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.628
What are they gonna do?
Throw us off?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.934
Don'’t be so sure
they would not.

09:06.458 --> 09:10.245
I broke many laws
putting you on my team,

09:10.245 --> 09:14.466
but no one
can find out about us.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.164
Is that clear?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.868
Automated voice:
<i>All personnel required
in the mess hall on C Deck.</i>

09:24.868 --> 09:27.828
<i>All personnel.
No exceptions.</i>

09:27.828 --> 09:31.266
<i>All personnel required
in the mess hall of C Deck.</i>

09:31.266 --> 09:33.834
<i>All personnel.
No exceptions.</i>

09:36.184 --> 09:38.273
Sorry, sorry.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.887
Hey, mind if I sit here?

09:43.887 --> 09:47.151
Sure. I'’m Alicia Nevins.
Some people call me Ali.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.066
Not that that'’s a preference.
It just kinda happens.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.591
Oh, I'’m on
the waste management team.
I-- I know. Gross.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.983
But it'’s not like
I didn'’t apply

09:52.983 --> 09:54.245
to every other branch
on the ship first.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.769
But, hey,
it got me on the ship.

09:55.769 --> 09:56.987
And my family are actually
really supportive.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.293
But why wouldn'’t they be, right?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.773
If we actually succeed
in building

09:59.773 --> 10:01.339
a sustainable colony,
all of our families

10:01.339 --> 10:03.472
get to be the first to
come out and settle there.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.127
Um, who are you?

10:06.127 --> 10:08.956
Call me Angus.
In horticulture.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.349
Wait, I know you.
You'’re that farmer boy.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.612
You grew crops
in the Mojave Desert.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.352
Well, I can see
why they'’d want you.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.528
Growing food on alien planet
we'’ve never seen before

10:16.528 --> 10:18.705
- is gonna be insane.
- Yeah.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.184
It scares
the bejesus out of me.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.231
But getting to learn
from Major Andrews?

10:23.231 --> 10:26.974
That'’s a dream of mine.
He'’s a legendary horticulturist.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.977
- Okay, listen up.
- I'’m not gonna beat
around the bush.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.587
We'’ve all been
in cryogenic sleep

10:31.587 --> 10:33.720
for exactly
five years and 92 days,

10:33.720 --> 10:36.766
which means
once we get back to speed,

10:36.766 --> 10:39.726
we still have over a year to go
before reaching Proxima B.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.945
No one told us
what happened to the ship.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.734
- We don'’t know.
- What do you mean
you don'’t know?

10:47.734 --> 10:49.170
It could'’ve been an asteroid,
space junk.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.433
Hell, a fuel cell
could'’ve burst.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.609
There'’s been a series
of malfunctions
while we were asleep.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.176
The ship'’s monitoring
cameras went down,

10:55.176 --> 10:56.786
so there'’s no recording
of what happened.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.223
But whatever happened,
it knocked it off course.

10:59.223 --> 11:03.097
The good news is
navigation systems are back up
and I'’ve course corrected.

11:03.097 --> 11:06.013
Both sleeper pod bays
were destroyed,

11:06.013 --> 11:09.451
the rear storage units,
as well as two ballasts,
and the reclamation unit,

11:09.451 --> 11:12.759
which means we can'’t recycle
any of our water.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.805
We carry roughly
a four-week supply onboard.

11:15.805 --> 11:19.591
We believe the water recycling
unit we have for the colony

11:19.591 --> 11:21.071
can be retrofitted to work here
on the ship.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.986
We just have to repurpose it.

11:22.986 --> 11:25.423
Until then,
we are on tight rations.

11:25.423 --> 11:28.775
This means no showers,
laundry, or any unnecessary
water uses.

11:28.775 --> 11:33.518
What if we'’re not able
to repurpose it?

11:33.518 --> 11:35.433
Even with rationing,
how long do we have

11:35.433 --> 11:37.479
before the water runs out?

11:37.479 --> 11:39.307
Let'’s think positively.

11:39.307 --> 11:42.266
- We'’ll make a functioning unit.
- Yeah.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.878
In the manifest, it said
that we weren'’t to wake up

11:44.878 --> 11:46.880
until two weeks before landing.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.710
So aside from the water,
what about food?

11:50.710 --> 11:55.453
Do we have enough supplies
to survive a year
out of the sleeper pods?

11:55.453 --> 11:57.238
We had been carrying
a year'’s supply,

11:57.238 --> 11:58.935
but that was held
in the storage units we lost.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.678
This ship has an additional
six weeks of food,

12:02.678 --> 12:05.855
but we will need
to reserve some of that
for post arrival.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.945
You expect to ration six weeks
of food for over a year?

12:08.945 --> 12:11.687
Okay, I demand to hear
from Captain Lester.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.081
- Where'’s the Captain?
- She'’s dead.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.044
What about Stuber?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.701
No? Monroe? Rodriguez?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.355
We lost them all
in the incident.

12:31.185 --> 12:34.188
The entire high command,
the mentor class,

12:34.188 --> 12:38.018
our top engineers, scientists,
architects, teachers,

12:38.018 --> 12:40.281
everybody that was in charge
of running this ship

12:40.281 --> 12:42.849
in Pod Bay 1 are dead.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.981
It all falls to us now.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.853
The three of us
standing before you

12:46.853 --> 12:49.246
are the highest ranking officers
left on this ship.

12:49.246 --> 12:52.467
- Then who'’s in charge?
- I am.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.860
- Excuse me?
- We all have the same rank.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.731
Each of you specialize

12:55.731 --> 12:57.907
in different aspects
of this ship.

12:57.907 --> 13:02.303
I have the most working
knowledge of all of the ship.

13:02.303 --> 13:05.175
When we get past this,
you can elect whomever you like
to be in command.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.874
I have no ambition
for governing.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.877
I care about survival,
and frankly,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.748
I'’m our best shot at it.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.098
Our food supply was intended
for 400 people.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.187
There are only 150 of us left.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.710
Therefore,
our limited food supply

13:18.710 --> 13:22.105
should last us
three times longer.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.325
More than that with rationing.

13:26.022 --> 13:29.983
This ship
had amazing leadership,

13:29.983 --> 13:32.463
and they were brought together
to nurture us

13:32.463 --> 13:35.336
into becoming
the colony'’s future.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.772
But they'’re all gone now.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.342
We don'’t have
the luxury of time.

13:41.342 --> 13:45.346
Each and every one of you
was chosen

13:45.346 --> 13:47.261
because you'’re the smartest
people in your fields.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.787
We have some of the most gifted
and skilled craftsmen,

13:51.787 --> 13:55.095
brilliant engineers
and scientists,

13:55.095 --> 14:00.317
chosen to build
a colony from scratch
on an alien planet,

14:00.317 --> 14:02.276
to save mankind.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.326
To save our families
back home.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.376
Starting today,

14:15.376 --> 14:18.161
we have to expect more
from each other...

14:20.511 --> 14:21.948
...and of ourselves.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.126
We have no alternatives.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.920
We grieve the brave men
and women

14:37.920 --> 14:41.054
who devoted themselves
and paid the ultimate sacrifice

14:41.054 --> 14:42.403
for the viability,

14:42.403 --> 14:44.709
the very existence
of this mission.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.843
As we remember
these kind souls,

14:47.843 --> 14:51.194
let us not lose ourselves
in grief.

14:51.194 --> 14:55.633
Instead, let us celebrate
the lives that these...

14:55.633 --> 14:58.114
Saw you try to save
Commander Ingram when
everything went to hell.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.943
Aw, she was a right pill,
that one.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.860
- You guys we close, huh?
- Susan handpicked me for this.

15:04.860 --> 15:10.431
She changed my life.
She saved my life.

15:10.431 --> 15:13.434
I get why the three
lowest ranking lieutenants

15:13.434 --> 15:17.742
were put in the pod bays
with the rest of us peasants,

15:17.742 --> 15:20.093
but why would they put
Ingram in with us?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.398
Strange, right?

15:24.097 --> 15:27.404
...those born
with an exceptional drive
to make this universe

15:27.404 --> 15:29.798
a better place
for the rest of us.

15:29.798 --> 15:33.236
And like the rest of us,
they left the comfort...

15:33.236 --> 15:35.891
That was very impressive
last night.

15:35.891 --> 15:40.678
A little presumptive,
but very take charge.

15:40.678 --> 15:44.987
Perhaps you didn'’t need
to be quite so honest
though, you know?

15:44.987 --> 15:47.250
It might'’ve inspired
a little more confidence
if they actually felt

15:47.250 --> 15:49.252
we knew how to safely
get to our destination.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.689
They'’re not children.
They volunteered to be here.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.343
They deserve an honest command.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.606
Right, and naturally
you'’re the best person

15:55.606 --> 15:56.607
to step up to the plate.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.046
I'’m the person who did step up.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.308
What the hell did you do?

16:01.308 --> 16:05.094
These people were our friends,

16:05.094 --> 16:09.707
friends we laughed with,
cried with,

16:09.707 --> 16:12.058
friends whose courageous spirits
led them all on a journey

16:12.058 --> 16:15.496
of science and discovery.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.715
They were the brightest stars
in their fields.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.505
- Hey, can I talk with you?
- I'’m very busy right now.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.072
Oh, please,
I just need a couple
minutes of your time.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.899
- Captain Garnet--
- Lieutenant.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.337
Yes.
Sorry, I get confused
with all the titles

16:30.337 --> 16:32.730
and ranks and stuff.
I know there'’s some kind
of chain of command, but--

16:32.730 --> 16:35.516
You'’re that 4H kid, right?

16:35.516 --> 16:37.387
I guess. Sure.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
There'’s something
you wanna say to me?

16:42.044 --> 16:45.134
No. I have something
I wanna show you.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.714
Is this breakfast
or a wedding ring?

17:01.890 --> 17:04.545
- Are you proposing?
- You'’re hilarious.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.115
What'’s that supposed to be?

17:09.115 --> 17:12.161
500 calories
and your water rations.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.207
We'’re gonna try to live
on 500 calories a day?

17:14.207 --> 17:16.861
You get one in the morning,
another at night.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.777
Oh, well, in that case...

17:19.777 --> 17:22.389
You wouldn'’t happen to have,
like, a vegan alternative.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.913
- Maybe something gluten-free?
- Next.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.576
I mean, 1,000 calories a day
is not a lot to live on,

17:35.576 --> 17:37.621
depending on height, age,
weight, and body type.

17:37.621 --> 17:40.537
Most major studies say that
a minimum of 1,200 calories
is required.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.583
In fact, the Center
for Human Nutrition

17:42.583 --> 17:44.585
still maintains eating
fewer than 1,000 calories

17:44.585 --> 17:47.457
has the same physiological
effects as total starvation.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.590
So we'’re right on the edge
of famishment.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.982
But I guess a few of us onboard

17:50.982 --> 17:53.159
could stand to lose
a few pounds.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.162
Oh. Uh...

17:56.162 --> 17:58.381
That was really inappropriate.
I'’m sorry.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.514
I'’m nervous,
and when I'’m nervous,

18:00.514 --> 18:03.038
I tend to run off at the mouth,
and I don'’t know what
I'’m saying sometimes.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.214
Wait, you didn'’t finish
your ration.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.826
Oh, you can have it.
I'’ve lost my appetite.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.654
- You sure you don'’t mind?
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.071
Major Andrews put me in charge

18:36.071 --> 18:37.855
of loading the gear
and supplies,

18:37.855 --> 18:39.770
so I control the inventory.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.295
If you'’re trying
to tell me some of your
gear is missing, I--

18:42.295 --> 18:44.210
No. No, no, not missing.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.038
In fact,
I'’m showing you something

18:47.038 --> 18:49.606
I wasn'’t supposed to bring.

18:53.044 --> 18:53.915
Uh...

18:58.398 --> 19:00.139
- What the hell is that?
- Soil.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.923
The most fertile on Earth.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.317
Chemically modified
by yours truly

19:04.317 --> 19:07.015
to make it into a super soil.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.757
Okay, I thought the planet
we were headed to
had appropriate soil.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.673
Oh, that'’s what was reported
by the probe we sent,

19:12.673 --> 19:14.892
but I didn'’t wanna get there

19:14.892 --> 19:18.200
and find out it was wrong
and we all starved to death.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.681
Okay, so you suddenly felt
the need to confess

19:20.681 --> 19:22.857
- you brought
unauthorized cargo.
- No.

19:22.857 --> 19:26.121
Yeah, right now
we have bigger issues than
misdemeanor illegal...

19:29.124 --> 19:33.172
I can grow crops
in this stuff anywhere.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.871
- Anywhere.
- Don'’t you need sunlight?

19:36.871 --> 19:40.222
Yeah, yeah,
I brought agricultural LEDs.

19:40.222 --> 19:44.835
Lots of them.
They need a lot of power.

19:44.835 --> 19:49.666
Power we got.
Where do you wanna setup?

19:49.666 --> 19:52.147
How much of the stuff in here
can we move someplace else?

20:10.165 --> 20:12.733
Don'’t touch that.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.517
Oh, my God.
You frightened me.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.997
I'’m going to have to
ask you to leave.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.912
You shouldn'’t sneak up
on a lady like that.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.305
You can'’t be in here.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.741
Until we can recycle
our water again,

20:20.741 --> 20:22.090
these showers are off-limits.

20:24.005 --> 20:29.184
Couldn'’t you make just
a small exception?

20:29.184 --> 20:31.012
- Don'’t.
- I just really need
a quick rinse.

20:31.012 --> 20:34.363
- Madam, please.
- You can watch. You'’ll see.

20:34.363 --> 20:38.019
I won'’t run the water
hardly at all, honest.

20:38.019 --> 20:42.241
See? I just need
a short rinse off.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.678
- No one has to know.
- It'’ll be our little secret.

20:47.594 --> 20:48.551
Please.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.815
I'’m sorry.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.398
I thought the sewage system
used air pressure.

21:09.398 --> 21:11.966
And a small amount of water,
which we now need elsewhere.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.228
Help me.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.057
Stack these over there.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.103
Whoa. Hold up.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.583
You can'’t bring
all of that down in here.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.585
There'’s not enough room
for this.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.761
People need to work down here.

21:24.761 --> 21:27.024
We'’re moving these crates
to all available spaces
around the ship.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.026
- You'’re not
the only one complaining.
- What'’s going on?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.289
Had to empty out
Storage Hold 3.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.251
- Make way.
- Coming through.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.957
Please tell me this is exactly
what I think it is.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.437
Depends on what
you think it is.

21:48.437 --> 21:52.267
You'’re building
a bio shelter farm
on the ship.

21:52.267 --> 21:56.402
That'’s amazing.
You'’re amazing.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.795
Major Andrews would be
so proud of you.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.494
Well, we'’re just
trying this out.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.409
It'’s gonna be a week or more

22:03.409 --> 22:05.367
before we have an idea
if this has a chance of working.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.152
- A lot could go wrong.
- What can I do to help?

22:08.152 --> 22:10.241
Oh, nothing.
We just have--

22:10.241 --> 22:11.199
Didn'’t you tell me
you work in waste management?

22:11.199 --> 22:12.461
Yes. Why?

22:14.202 --> 22:16.465
I'’m gonna need
a ton of fertilizer.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.990
- Ew.
- Yeah.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.210
Eww.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.087
- Hey, sport.
- Hi.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.046
- Hey, doody head.
- Stop it.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.701
- We know you'’re still sleeping.
- For, like, a year.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.486
And you probably won'’t see this
until just before you land.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.968
But we want you
to know that we think
about you all the time.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.709
We'’re so proud of you, Baylor.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.712
We love you, and we know
that we'’ll all be reunited

22:45.712 --> 22:48.367
in the colony that you build.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.370
Your family?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.763
I was checking the last burst
of communications to the ship.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.679
- One of them
just happened to be--
- It'’s fine, Trent, honestly.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.900
That message
was nearly four years ago.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.292
We haven'’t received
any communications at all.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.251
I know.
I reviewed the logs.

23:03.251 --> 23:06.472
How was that even possible?
Nothing from command?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.084
You think everything'’s okay
back home?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.347
We have no way of knowing.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.131
If even just one of those
relay satellites broke down,

23:14.131 --> 23:15.655
we'’d lose communications.

23:18.266 --> 23:23.184
My family wanted me
accepted onto this program
more than anything.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.492
I failed recruitment.
Yeah, twice.

23:26.492 --> 23:30.452
But Susan--
I mean, Commander Ingram,

23:30.452 --> 23:32.976
yeah, she picked me anyway.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.891
Well, she must'’ve seen
something very special in you.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.202
Can I ask you
a personal question?

23:41.202 --> 23:44.423
- Shoot.
- Do you ever regret it?

23:46.033 --> 23:48.514
You know,
volunteering for all this?

23:48.514 --> 23:50.341
You know,
if you lose your family,

23:50.341 --> 23:52.518
lose you your friends,
people you love--

23:52.518 --> 23:53.736
We get our colony up
and working,

23:53.736 --> 23:54.824
you'’ll see them all again.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.176
By now the Ark program
has ships searching

23:59.176 --> 24:01.570
the known universe
for a new home...

24:05.313 --> 24:07.141
But not everyone
is going to make it, Trent.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.883
It'’s survival of the fittest.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.493
No one is going to
just hand this to us.

24:13.147 --> 24:16.455
We have to take it.
You get me?

24:19.196 --> 24:22.591
- What was that?
- Hey, what just happened?

24:22.591 --> 24:25.899
- We'’ve started the rerouting.
- Rerouting? What rerouting?

24:25.899 --> 24:28.118
Power to the storage bay.
They need a lot of it.

24:28.118 --> 24:31.252
- Under whose orders?
- Lieutenant Garnet, sir.

24:37.824 --> 24:41.088
- Are we good to go?
- We'’ve quadrupled capacity
for the breakers.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.917
The storage bay wasn'’t meant
for this kind of juice.

24:43.917 --> 24:47.268
- I can'’t promise anything.
- Okay. Light it up!

24:57.017 --> 24:57.931
Oh, it'’s beautiful!

25:01.456 --> 25:03.850
What the hell
is going on in here?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.243
Our young 4-H wunderkind
came up with a way
to build a farm.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.855
So stringbean has an idea
and you just go steal
power from the ship?

25:08.855 --> 25:11.814
Well, it'’s the only way
to get the light intensity
for accelerated growth.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.729
Ah, he speaks. Perfect.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.427
- Is there a problem here?
- Yes.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.952
You taking unilateral action
without consulting anyone.

25:18.952 --> 25:22.259
We have a food shortage.
This is an attempt
to address it.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.131
Why would anyone
in their right mind
object to that?

25:24.131 --> 25:27.177
Are you 100% sure
this will work?

25:30.398 --> 25:32.879
What about you?

25:32.879 --> 25:36.273
No doubts
this will provide edible food
for the entire crew?

25:36.273 --> 25:37.579
We'’re just trying
to grow produce.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.799
And that takes water,
doesn'’t it?

25:39.799 --> 25:42.584
We'’re planting crops
that are extremely
stingy with water.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.673
Amaranth grain, corn--

25:44.673 --> 25:49.069
Yes, but they still need
some water, don'’t they?

25:49.069 --> 25:52.159
- Yes, sir.
- It'’s not your water, Sharon.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.509
It belongs to everyone
on this ship.

25:54.509 --> 25:57.120
Now maybe this is a great idea,
maybe it isn'’t,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.862
but if you'’re going
to use valuable resources
that affect us all,

25:59.862 --> 26:02.038
then we should have a say in it.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.737
Nobody put you in charge.
We'’re just tolerating it.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.704
You'’re right. I apologize.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.879
I should'’ve brought
everyone together

26:16.879 --> 26:17.967
and allowed people
to weigh in.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.013
You think?

26:20.013 --> 26:22.319
And you should'’ve pulled me
aside and spoken with me.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.539
Instead,
you need to grandstand
and challenge me

26:24.539 --> 26:26.541
- in front of everyone.
- Don'’t make this about me.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.978
You'’ve done that
all by yourself.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.027
Hold off on irrigation.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.163
I'’m Dr. Sanjivni Kabir.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.035
I'’m representing
the medical staff onboard.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.777
Felix Strickland, acting head
of security enforcement.

26:44.777 --> 26:48.607
Eva Markovic,
acting head of maintenance,

26:48.607 --> 26:51.087
- engineering, and construction.
- This body will serve

26:51.087 --> 26:52.480
as the representative
voice of the ship

26:52.480 --> 26:54.351
until the current crisis
is over.

26:54.351 --> 26:55.875
Can someone please tell me

26:55.875 --> 26:57.224
what'’s the point
of this meeting?

26:57.224 --> 26:59.095
We'’ve got a bleeding
food crisis, right?

26:59.095 --> 27:01.489
The kid says he can grow crops,
so let him.

27:01.489 --> 27:05.101
While limited,
some of the water will be
needed to grow the crops,

27:05.101 --> 27:06.625
and we'’re not 100% sure
this will work.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.975
- The water could be wasted.
- Right, maybe.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.934
But unless we can figure out
how to get more food,
then we die. End of story.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.327
There are other
considerations as well.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.894
We'’re diverting power
to the labs,

27:14.894 --> 27:16.373
which means
the rest of the ship
is being deprived.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.245
Power usage now is
approximately what it was

27:18.245 --> 27:19.507
while we were all
in the sleeper pods.
It shouldn'’t--

27:19.507 --> 27:20.726
When we were
in the sleeper pods,

27:20.726 --> 27:22.684
the life support systems
were not in use.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.381
- There could be
an adverse effect.
- Oh, could. Maybe.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.601
We will absolutely all die
if we don'’t have more food.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.560
I'’m just saying we need
to run probability scenarios,
do thorough testing.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.650
Make sure we'’re not wasting
what little water we have left.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.174
Instead we'’d only be
wasting valuable time?

27:34.174 --> 27:36.742
Where are we on constructing
a new water recycling unit?

27:36.742 --> 27:39.658
We'’re having difficulties
finding all the necessary parts.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.224
I'’m confident
we'’ll be able to make
a functioning unit--

27:41.224 --> 27:43.052
Forgive me if I would like
to have something

27:43.052 --> 27:45.925
- a little more concrete
than your optimism.
- It'’s not easy.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.623
We'’re searching in the dark
with only flashlights.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.625
We'’ll get those lights back on
back in those units.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.888
And what if the power drain
affects life support?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.237
I mean, that could kill us
long before we starve.

27:54.237 --> 27:57.240
Whatever we do going forward
will entail risks.

27:57.240 --> 28:02.419
We'’re on a damaged ship
and we'’re deficient on supplies.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.770
We'’re just gonna have
to make tough choices.

28:17.347 --> 28:20.046
We set the drip
for three minute intervals
every 14 hours.

28:20.046 --> 28:23.179
If there'’s no signs of
germination within the first
four days, we'’ll terminate.

28:23.179 --> 28:27.270
- Is that really enough time?
- In this soil,
we should see something.

28:30.665 --> 28:33.407
- I don'’t wanna waste
any more water.
- We need food to survive.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.368
Make it work.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.638
Let'’s do it!

29:10.313 --> 29:13.099
Do you really think
they can make enough food
for all of us?

29:13.099 --> 29:17.146
Maybe,
but we first have to rebuild
the water recycling unit.

29:19.322 --> 29:23.109
Okay, you got your lights,
now find those parts.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.164
Ensign Trent, you are not
scheduled for physical therapy
until tomorrow.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.123
I know, I know, I know.
I just--

29:37.123 --> 29:39.299
I gotta get out of this suit.
It'’s driving me crazy.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.866
Everyone recovers
at their own pace.

29:40.866 --> 29:41.997
You can'’t speed up
the process.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.521
You okay?

29:44.521 --> 29:47.611
Doctor, I'’m--
I'’m having trouble breathing.

29:47.611 --> 29:53.139
You have no history of asthma
or any lung problems.

29:53.139 --> 29:56.620
Automated voice:
<i>Life support warning.
Oxygen depletion alert.</i>

29:56.620 --> 30:00.755
<i>All crew members, please
retrieve compression suits
and helmets.</i>

30:00.755 --> 30:04.933
<i>Repeat, life support warning.
Oxygen depletion alert.</i>

30:04.933 --> 30:08.545
<i>All crew members, please
retrieve compression suits
and helmets.</i>

30:08.545 --> 30:11.592
<i>Repeat, oxygen
depletion alert.</i>

30:11.592 --> 30:14.943
<i>All crew members, please
retrieve compression suits
and helmets.</i>

30:16.902 --> 30:19.774
This inhaler will give you
some relief.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.950
Get your suit on
and I'’ll grab us some helmets.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.107
No, wait!
Over here! Quickly!

30:48.107 --> 30:49.891
<i>Oxygen emergency.</i>

30:49.891 --> 30:52.415
<i>Lockdown protocol is enacted.</i>

31:04.427 --> 31:06.386
<i>Oxygen emergency.</i>

31:06.386 --> 31:08.431
<i>Lockdown protocol is enacted.</i>

31:17.484 --> 31:19.660
- I'’ll get help.
- What the...

31:31.411 --> 31:32.760
What the hell
is happening, Brice?

31:32.760 --> 31:35.197
Once the ship hits
15% oxygen levels,

31:35.197 --> 31:36.546
it automatically
goes into lockdown.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.331
Oxygen?
Why are we losing oxygen?

31:38.331 --> 31:40.202
I don'’t know.
It could be a leak.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.421
Maybe a mechanical malfunction.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.683
What do you mean
you don'’t know?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.467
I am goddamn
navigation wonk, right?

31:44.467 --> 31:46.078
This is not my area.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.993
So, all I can tell you
is the system diagnostics

31:47.993 --> 31:49.864
are stuck in some kind of loop.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.648
It won'’t tell me what's wrong,
how to fix it,

31:51.648 --> 31:54.521
and I can'’t break it!

31:57.654 --> 31:59.526
How long do we have
to figure this out?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.832
Well, the suits should be good
for at least an hour of oxygen.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.965
For anyone who wasn'’t able
to get a suit on?

32:03.965 --> 32:05.793
In lockdown,
all we have left is the oxygen
we have in each section.

32:05.793 --> 32:09.362
But right now
we'’re averaging 13%,
and it'’s still dropping.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.074
I don'’t know what coding
they'’ve used.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.902
- I can'’t crack this open.
- Where'’s chief life support?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.948
That'’s a great
goddamn question.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.080
We put out the summons.
All personnel should be
manning their stations!

32:32.080 --> 32:34.865
Look him up, find him,
get his ass in here now!

32:34.865 --> 32:36.563
We need a team on every deck.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.521
See if we can find the source
of the malfunction.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.871
- Lieutenant.
- If software can'’t
diagnose the cause,

32:40.871 --> 32:45.354
maybe we can through
process of elimination.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.704
You, come with me.
We'’re gonna start at the front,

32:47.704 --> 32:50.707
work our way back,
and find the problem.

32:50.707 --> 32:54.276
Chief Jasper Dades,
what is your location?

32:54.276 --> 32:56.365
Jasper Dades,
identify yourself.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.845
<i>You'’re wanted
in Cent-Com, stat.</i>

33:56.121 --> 33:59.385
- What is taking so long?
- Sasha doesn'’t want
to damage the lock.

33:59.385 --> 34:00.864
Tell him to get
the door open now.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.871
Eva, what aren'’t you telling me?

34:11.179 --> 34:15.314
I didn'’t get to that section
of the hallway yet.

34:15.314 --> 34:16.750
Helmets in there
are practically empty.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.023
Empty.

34:30.155 --> 34:33.332
Empty.

34:38.032 --> 34:41.644
There are full helmets
on this side.
Just get the door open!

35:03.362 --> 35:06.191
Oxygen relay station Deck B
forward bow has no anomalies.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.454
Did you find
anything elsewhere?

35:08.454 --> 35:10.717
Look, so far
we haven'’t been able
to identify the anomaly.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.116
Jasper Dades?

35:39.441 --> 35:41.400
Move. Get out of my way.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.450
It'’s unbreakable.
Save your breath.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.804
Sasha, can we get out of here
through some air vents?

35:54.804 --> 35:56.502
Is there a crawlspace
or something like that?

35:56.502 --> 36:00.027
When the ship
goes into lockdown,
all vents are sealed.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.116
Guys, I can'’t breathe.
Guys--

36:08.209 --> 36:12.082
- What are you doing?
- Take off his helmet now.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.740
Breathe.

36:24.878 --> 36:28.142
Look, there'’s still some air
in here, okay?

36:28.142 --> 36:30.927
Don'’t speak. Small breaths.

36:30.927 --> 36:35.105
Use as little oxygen
as you can, okay?

36:37.499 --> 36:39.936
Emergency situation.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.461
Emergency situation
in R Deck,

36:42.461 --> 36:44.332
aft section above
maintenance holding.

36:44.332 --> 36:47.335
<i>We have workers suffocating
behind a sealed doorway.</i>

36:47.335 --> 36:49.511
- <i>Send help!</i>
- Can we override lockdown

36:49.511 --> 36:51.078
and get that door open
from here?

36:51.078 --> 36:52.514
Not without access to
the life support systems, no.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.951
They'’d have to do it manually.

36:54.951 --> 36:55.996
Where the hell have you been?

36:57.780 --> 37:01.088
Sorry, I can'’t-- it--

37:01.088 --> 37:03.221
- malfunction-- and--
- Our diagnostics have crashed,

37:03.221 --> 37:06.136
and we can find
where the problem is
with life support.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.835
We need you to fix this.

37:12.186 --> 37:15.015
- You hear me now?
- Yes, thank you. Much better.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.408
Can you fix it?

37:19.411 --> 37:21.891
Software malfunction?
Ah, it'’s below my paygrade.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.153
Get a worker to do it.

37:26.766 --> 37:31.205
- Fix it.
- All right, um,

37:31.205 --> 37:33.816
I'’d need assistance
from my team.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.341
- I'’d need time--
- Yeah, well, we don'’t
have any bleeding time.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.690
There is no air
left in this ship,

37:37.690 --> 37:40.083
so when the helmets run out,
we'’re all dead.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.783
Fix this.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.815
Trent! Thank God.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.164
Well, you brilliant boy.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.818
You found an oxygen tank
from surgical?

38:18.818 --> 38:20.820
Why didn'’t I think of that?

38:20.820 --> 38:23.126
But how did you get out
of the infirmary?

38:23.126 --> 38:25.041
I rewired the lock.

38:25.041 --> 38:29.394
One of just a few benefits
of a misplaced youth.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.221
Hurry.
We have to get to R Deck.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.057
- I can'’t fix it.
- What the hell do you mean
you can'’t fix it?

38:41.057 --> 38:43.146
- You installed it.
- Sorry, I can'’t.

38:43.146 --> 38:46.846
- Why can'’t you fix it?
- Because I'’m not Jasper Dades.

38:46.846 --> 38:50.023
- What?
- My names Malcolm Perry.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.852
I'’m a transpo scrub.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.941
I don'’t know
the first thing about this.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.073
- Where is the real guy?
- I don'’t know.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.684
I took his place on the ship.

38:58.684 --> 39:00.250
- I impersonated him.
- Stop!

39:00.250 --> 39:03.645
I should kill you right now.
Arrest this piece of shit.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.952
Come on.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.693
Ensign Stein, go through
every crew member.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.695
Find anyone who has
advanced coding education

39:09.695 --> 39:12.088
or life support systems training
and bring them here.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.700
Lane. Lane, you guys
find anything yet?

39:14.700 --> 39:16.963
Nothing, but we still have
a few more stations to check.

39:21.663 --> 39:23.143
Is this all my fault?

39:24.449 --> 39:25.711
Because I rerouted the power?

39:27.669 --> 39:28.496
God help us.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.901
Engineering! Engineering!

39:41.901 --> 39:45.339
- We need help!
- Hey. Hey.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.517
Hey, uh,
I just wanted to tell you

39:49.517 --> 39:54.130
that I appreciate everything
you ever did for me.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.524
Don'’t talk.
There are people coming.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.483
- And I need you--
- Shh.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.920
- I need you know that--
- Shh.

40:00.920 --> 40:04.663
- You'’re wasting oxygen.
- I love you.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.197
Harris!

40:18.677 --> 40:19.765
Step aside!

40:22.289 --> 40:24.334
We have a locksmith onboard.
Who knew?

40:24.334 --> 40:25.988
Hurry!

40:31.341 --> 40:32.952
Come on, baby. Come on.

40:32.952 --> 40:35.824
We need to get them
all to med bay, stat!

40:35.824 --> 40:39.480
Here you go. Come on.
Let'’s go. Come on.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.965
Lieutenant Garnet,
the three candidates are here.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.141
I know this is not
your area of expertise,

40:48.141 --> 40:49.534
but if any of you have any
knowledge of these systems,

40:49.534 --> 40:51.536
how to crack it open,
debug it--

40:51.536 --> 40:52.537
I haven'’t studied
life support systems since

40:52.537 --> 40:54.016
my junior year at community--

40:54.016 --> 40:55.365
We don'’t expect you
to be experts.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.629
It'’s stuck in a Barstow loop.

40:57.629 --> 41:01.676
- What?
- Named after Elliot Barstow,

41:01.676 --> 41:03.591
who created
the original coding language.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.201
It'’s kind of a known flaw.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.638
Usually happens
in power failures
or extreme surges.

41:06.638 --> 41:09.423
- But can you break it?
- I think I can.

41:09.423 --> 41:14.254
- Then do it. Come on.
- Um, okay, uh...

41:14.254 --> 41:16.778
It'’s deceptively easy,
which is why so many people

41:16.778 --> 41:18.171
have a hard time
with this software.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.042
Everyone expects
normal security protocols,

41:20.042 --> 41:22.436
but Barstow is essentially lazy
and only wants to work

41:22.436 --> 41:25.787
on the parts
that interested him,
so bypassed norms.

41:25.787 --> 41:27.876
It'’s probably why his stuff
is so much less expensive.

41:27.876 --> 41:31.010
Uh, um...

41:32.185 --> 41:34.013
Done.

41:34.013 --> 41:37.451
No, now we need it to tell us
why we'’re losing oxygen.

41:37.451 --> 41:41.324
- Yeah, of course.
Sorry, I got all caught up.
- Okay, come on!

41:48.810 --> 41:50.769
Automated voice:
<i>Malfunction identified.</i>

41:53.641 --> 41:58.080
Lane, prepare a team
for an emergency EVA.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.256
I am way ahead of you.
I'’ll be out in five.

42:00.256 --> 42:02.258
I'’m sending the diagnostics
findings to you now.

42:02.258 --> 42:03.738
We'’ve identified the source
of the problem.

42:05.435 --> 42:07.394
Correction, Alicia Nevins did.

42:43.299 --> 42:45.563
We found it.

42:47.347 --> 42:48.696
Sealing the breach now.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.578
Attention crew,
the oxygen crisis is over.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.884
We'’re back online
and lockdown has been released.

43:02.884 --> 43:05.104
<i>You may remove your helmets.</i>

43:29.519 --> 43:31.260
Give me 20 cc'’s andestrine.

43:31.260 --> 43:33.480
20 cc'’s andestrine.

43:37.397 --> 43:41.227
He'’s not reacting.
Give him 15 cc'’s palastrimol.

43:41.227 --> 43:45.535
15 cc'’s palastrimol.
We'’re losing him, doc.

43:45.535 --> 43:48.756
Nothing.
20 cc'’s of cantastro.

43:48.756 --> 43:51.977
- Come on, come on!
- 20 cc'’s cantastro.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.420
I'’m so sorry.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.743
You saved a lot of people
today, Trent.

44:18.743 --> 44:20.005
You'’re a hero.

44:37.587 --> 44:40.590
Nice job. Truly.

44:42.375 --> 44:45.508
Elliot Barstow?

44:45.508 --> 44:48.381
I did a thesis on him
for extra credit when I went
for my coding master'’s.

44:48.381 --> 44:51.123
But that was before
I decided to do a master'’s
in atmospheric science.

44:51.123 --> 44:54.561
Wait, you'’ve got two
bleeding master'’s degrees?
How old are you?

44:54.561 --> 44:57.869
Next month I turn 19.
And four degrees actually.

44:57.869 --> 45:01.611
Right. And you work
where on the ship?

45:03.265 --> 45:06.704
- Waste management.
- Yeah, well, not anymore.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.099
Alicia Nevins, you are
now chief life support.

45:11.099 --> 45:15.974
Congratulations.
Welcome to the bridge.

45:42.261 --> 45:44.611
You fixed the oxygen? See?

45:44.611 --> 45:47.832
- You didn'’t need my help--
- Why'’d you do it?

45:47.832 --> 45:50.269
You'’re kidding me, right?

45:50.269 --> 45:52.706
Everyone wanted
to be on this ship,

45:52.706 --> 45:54.490
the first ark
sent to the planet

45:54.490 --> 45:56.841
with the highest
probability of success.

45:56.841 --> 46:01.019
- I mean, come on.
- How?

46:01.019 --> 46:02.760
I paid a hacker
to make Jasper think

46:02.760 --> 46:05.153
he was reassigned to Ark 2.

46:05.153 --> 46:08.548
Forged ID files
so I could show up
in his place.

46:08.548 --> 46:13.422
- But your DNA is--
- Is matched against
the master DNA catalogs.

46:13.422 --> 46:16.295
You think they can'’t
be hacked, too?

46:16.295 --> 46:19.037
They told us
Earth had 70 years.

46:21.039 --> 46:22.867
That'’s why they started
the Ark program.

46:22.867 --> 46:26.653
What if it'’s only ten? Five?

46:26.653 --> 46:30.222
In a couple days,
the representative council
will meet to decide your fate,

46:30.222 --> 46:33.094
and I'’m recommending
the death penalty.

46:33.094 --> 46:34.922
You know I'’m not the only one.

46:34.922 --> 46:37.533
Lots of people faked
their way onto this ship.

46:37.533 --> 46:39.709
It'’s not just me who ain't
who they say they are.

46:39.709 --> 46:43.191
Six people died.

46:43.191 --> 46:44.584
We almost lost
the entire ship because of you.

46:44.584 --> 46:46.760
Wait. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait.

46:46.760 --> 46:49.110
Wait. Think about it
before you make that

46:49.110 --> 46:51.330
recommendation
to the council.

46:51.330 --> 46:53.549
Now, I know a lot
of other people

46:53.549 --> 46:54.855
who have committed crimes
who are on this ship.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.164
What stage of death
is bargaining?

46:59.164 --> 47:02.645
I'’ve been to a lot of places
and I'’ve seen things.

47:04.125 --> 47:08.303
Like a bar
in Jacksonville, Florida.

47:08.303 --> 47:13.178
You know, the kind
where cadets hang out at
and drink a bit too much.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.922
Met a lot of people there,

47:17.922 --> 47:22.535
including a sexy cadet

47:22.535 --> 47:25.320
with hair-trigger
anger issues.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.280
I believe her name
was Denise?

47:30.848 --> 47:34.939
Yeah, yeah.
I'’m pretty sure it was Denise.

47:34.939 --> 47:39.421
A shame what happened. Tragic.

47:41.946 --> 47:44.992
But maybe I'’m mistaken.

47:44.992 --> 47:46.559
We'’ll have to see
how good my memory is.

47:52.434 --> 47:55.568
You heard the evidence.
Several of you in this room
have heard his confession.

47:55.568 --> 47:58.353
Operational protocol calls for
punishment to be anywhere

47:58.353 --> 48:02.923
between a three month
imprisonment and execution.

48:02.923 --> 48:04.882
Would anyone like to give
their recommendation?

48:04.882 --> 48:07.928
We should hear from the accused
before we pass judgment.

48:07.928 --> 48:10.148
He should have the right
to speak on his own behalf.

48:12.759 --> 48:13.847
Have him brought
to this chamber.

49:39.498 --> 49:41.326
<i>This season on "The Ark"...</i>

49:41.326 --> 49:43.110
And how we supposed
to investigate what hit us?

49:43.110 --> 49:45.156
Some kind of crystal thing
wedged in there.

49:45.156 --> 49:47.071
- Aye, they look like diamonds.
- Could'’ve been a weapon.

49:47.071 --> 49:49.290
We'’re the only people in history
to go this far in space.

49:49.290 --> 49:53.120
I wish you would'’ve taken
the cryo pod next to mine
like I asked.

49:53.120 --> 49:57.429
Do we even know who she is?
She didn'’t train
with the rest of us.

49:57.429 --> 49:59.866
I never understood
why that rule even existed,

49:59.866 --> 50:01.824
that couples couldn'’t be
in the same Ark.

50:01.824 --> 50:04.349
- Something to do
with genetic diversity.
- What?

50:04.349 --> 50:06.960
We need Garnet out
of the picture permanently.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.223
I never thought I'’d hear
such drastic measures
coming from you.

50:09.223 --> 50:11.530
I'’ve seen your medical records.

50:11.530 --> 50:13.793
They'’re too perfect to be real.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.536
I just thought if
I talked about it first,
I might chicken out,

50:17.536 --> 50:18.711
so I just kind of like--

50:22.758 --> 50:24.934
Lieutenant Lane.
Keep an eye on that one.

50:24.934 --> 50:27.328
What the heck kind
of knife is this?

50:27.328 --> 50:29.330
I think I know
who the murderer is.

50:29.330 --> 50:31.985
How does Lane make a call
from the sector of a ship

50:31.985 --> 50:32.899
that doesn'’t exist?

50:35.945 --> 50:37.469
Shit.

50:37.469 --> 50:39.384
Our drift has taken us
right into a collision course

50:39.384 --> 50:41.255
with an asteroid.

50:41.255 --> 50:42.909
Detaching in three, two--

50:47.479 --> 50:50.743
- Wake up, dummy.
- You love me.

50:51.961 --> 50:53.441
Aah! Ow!

50:55.226 --> 50:56.575
Initiate faster
than light travel.

51:01.406 --> 51:03.495
- What'’s happening to us?
- Proximity alert.

51:03.495 --> 51:04.713
There'’s a ship approaching.

51:04.713 --> 51:05.932
- From where?
- I don'’t know.
