It has to do with Rob.
He kissed some chick.

he doesn't want

he hasn't had sex with me

I'm sorry.

02:02.533 --> 02:06.000
I'm gonna put this
voice recording from Faith

02:10.633 --> 02:12.233
Just so everyone
can hear it, okay?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.000
Brittany,
why would you do that?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.400
- Oh, because you're
a piece of ----ing sh--,

02:16.400 --> 02:18.400

to rot in hell.

- We're not gonna deal with

03:06.433 --> 03:08.433
your bullsh--,
and I'm done with these men

03:08.433 --> 03:10.767
thinking that they can do
whatever the  they want!

03:10.767 --> 03:13.266
- Okay, so,
whose recording is it?

03:13.266 --> 03:15.533
- Faith sent this out.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.533
- Just wait till you hear
what I heard

03:17.533 --> 03:20.033
and this is why I don't care to
----ing spread it around.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.300
- I want you to press play.
I don't want to press play.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.500
I want you to do that.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.600
- It's bad.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.200
- Jax is saying the most
horrible things about Brittany.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.567
- He doesn't want to
marry Brittany,

03:33.567 --> 03:35.400
he's never gonna
have children with her,

03:35.400 --> 03:38.600
and he's not even
attracted to her anymore.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.166
- He's telling Faith that
she's, like, the best sex

03:41.166 --> 03:42.667
he's ever--oh.

03:42.667 --> 03:45.400
- "It's not that
I don't like being with her,

03:45.400 --> 03:47.467
just not sexually."

03:47.467 --> 03:49.734
- The fact that he can
lay up with another woman

03:49.734 --> 03:51.433
that is not his girlfriend

03:51.433 --> 03:53.667
and talk about his girlfriend
the way he was

03:53.667 --> 03:55.333
is disgusting to me.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.734
- Done, done, done.

03:56.734 --> 03:59.000
Move the  out!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.600
- I cheated.
I did everything wrong.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.266
I understand that.

04:02.266 --> 04:04.266
I'm--I'm going through it.

04:04.266 --> 04:07.367
I sat Brittany down
the other day and we talked.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.433
I said, "Listen, I want to go
through this

04:08.433 --> 04:10.066
between you and me."

04:10.066 --> 04:12.467
She said, "Yes, that's--
I want to work this out.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.100
Let's make it
between us."

04:14.100 --> 04:15.734
And then this.

04:15.734 --> 04:18.100
- Jax, take a sip of that.
I'm gonna go get alcohol.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.300
Let's stay here.
- I'll go get it.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.767
- Please.
- Yeah.

04:20.767 --> 04:22.433
I'll be right back.

04:22.433 --> 04:23.767
- No, dude.
Dude, no, no.

04:23.767 --> 04:25.433
No, that's ----ed up.
That's too far.

04:29.367 --> 04:31.100
Is that my phone?

04:31.100 --> 04:32.500
Hey, I need that.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.300
- Shut up, Tom.
It's my phone.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.066
- Jax, just figure it out.
- It's my phone, Tom!

04:36.066 --> 04:38.333
- I'm getting it
for you, dude.

04:38.333 --> 04:43.033
- I'm gonna ----ing kick
your ----ing ass, bitch!

04:43.033 --> 04:44.734
- You guys are gonna let
Brittany talk like that

04:44.734 --> 04:46.333
when she doesn't
have to?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.667
out
right now! Stop!

04:48.667 --> 04:50.533
You have no idea
what it's like

04:50.533 --> 04:52.633
for her to go through this
right now!

04:52.633 --> 04:54.467
So sit down and listen...
- And why are you

04:54.467 --> 04:56.000
protecting Faith right now?
- Or go off.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.633
- No,
I'm not protecting Faith!

04:57.633 --> 04:59.333
- Walk away!
- I literally just said

04:59.333 --> 05:00.767
why are you letting her
talk like that,

05:00.767 --> 05:02.533
'cause Brittany's
a sweetheart.

05:02.533 --> 05:06.734
- I am a ----ing sweetheart,
you dumb-ass mother----er!

05:06.734 --> 05:09.467
I've never done anything wrong
to any of you mother----ers!

05:09.467 --> 05:11.734
And I'm through!
I'm not ----ing okay!

05:11.734 --> 05:14.233
I'll be a crazy bitch,
I don't ----ing care.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.500
- Now they're at my place.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.734
I was gonna say
we could all go there.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.400
- Let's just party.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.000
- No, we're here!
You have a bomb-ass house!

05:21.000 --> 05:23.100
- We literally have
all the artichoke dip,

05:23.100 --> 05:25.600
all the Jell-O shots,
all the whatever.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.500
- Who--did you
do that to me?

05:28.500 --> 05:29.734
Did you do that
to me?

05:32.033 --> 05:33.533
- Brittany is the one--
- Jax, look at me.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.367
No, talk to me, 'cause
I know how mad you are.

05:35.367 --> 05:36.633
- No, no, no.
- James, James, relax.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.266
- Stop, man.
- Just be quiet.

05:38.266 --> 05:39.533
- Stop.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.700
- Brittany wanted to
broadcast it.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.033
- The relationship's done.

05:45.433 --> 05:48.100
It's over.
- Just speak to him.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.700
- I'll go home.
Can I tell you the truth?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.166
It was Lala and Ariana.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.633
Just so you know.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.166
♪ ♪

05:54.166 --> 05:56.166
- That's how
the audio came out.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.133
- All right.

05:58.133 --> 06:00.166
- Why would Lala
and Ariana do that?

06:00.166 --> 06:01.700
- I'll ask.

06:01.700 --> 06:05.400
Playing this recording
after hours of drinking...

06:05.400 --> 06:07.133
- One, two.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.767
together: Chug it!
Chug it! Chug it!

06:11.400 --> 06:13.700
Is such a horrible idea.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.400
Is Ariana out of
her

06:16.400 --> 06:18.266
- I think we should have
a girls' night here,

06:18.266 --> 06:20.200
but we should definitely go
down and make the boys feel

06:20.200 --> 06:22.000
super unwelcome
at our place.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.734
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.200
Hold down the fort.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.433
- Well, apparently
it's Ariana and Lala.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.400
- I'm disgusted by it.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.533
I'm honestly
disgusted by it.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.266
- Okay.
, Ariana?

06:37.266 --> 06:39.567
I heard that you
showed her that video

06:39.567 --> 06:41.333
and said--brought it up.
Why?

06:41.333 --> 06:43.000
- It was brought to me.
I didn't know what to do.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.433
Why Why

06:44.433 --> 06:46.133
- Lala brought her
in the room.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.734
- Is that your judgment,
Ariana?

06:47.734 --> 06:49.600
You really
need to say that to me?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.467
Like you have any ----ing--
like question in your mind?

06:51.467 --> 06:53.500
- So you waited until Brittany
was really

06:53.500 --> 06:55.033
- You didn't think

06:55.033 --> 06:56.700
to take, like, a second
and say, hey--

06:56.700 --> 06:59.200
- It's not on my phone!
It's on Lala's phone.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.066
- So you approached Brittany
after she'd been drinking--

07:01.066 --> 07:03.567
- Oh, my God, I did not
approach Brittany!

07:03.567 --> 07:06.100
I was sitting on
the ----ing patio, Tom.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.467
I didn't
approach Brittany.

07:07.467 --> 07:10.066
I was like,
I don't know what to do.

07:10.066 --> 07:13.166
Should she hear this?
Should she not hear this?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.600
- You should have had
the ----ing wherewithal

07:14.600 --> 07:15.767
to know that, like,
maybe it's not...

07:15.767 --> 07:18.467
- The right time.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.633
- You're being so, like--

07:23.233 --> 07:24.567
- Dude, obtuse
right now.

07:24.567 --> 07:26.100
- Yes.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.333
Oh, my God,
seriously, Tom?

07:28.333 --> 07:30.300
You're gonna take
douchebag Jax's side,

07:30.300 --> 07:32.500
who just cheated on
his girlfriend,

07:32.500 --> 07:34.233
over mine,
the girl that you love

07:34.233 --> 07:36.000
and the girl that
you live with?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.767
Are you

07:37.767 --> 07:39.600
- I'm really mad at you
for this.

07:41.066 --> 07:43.367
- For, like, not using
your judgment

07:43.367 --> 07:45.400
to be like, maybe she shouldn't
hear this right now.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.066
- And I ----ing take a stand.
- Tom, it's not on my phone!

07:47.066 --> 07:50.467
It's not on my phone!
It's on Lala's phone!

07:50.467 --> 07:51.533
- Just say no!

07:51.533 --> 07:54.734
- It's not on my phone!

07:54.734 --> 07:56.633
God,
you're a ----ing dick, dude.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
- Keep having Jax's back,
you ----ing dick!

08:00.400 --> 08:03.300
outta here!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.000
- Has Brittany
heard it yet?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.400
- Yeah.
Brittany was like this,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.633
"Why?"

08:19.133 --> 08:19.400
♪ Na, na, na ♪

08:21.233 --> 08:23.367
♪ Na-na, na-na, na-na ♪

08:23.367 --> 08:24.767
- James is coming in
to meet me.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.500
- Monday and Tuesday

08:26.500 --> 08:28.100
are slower.
- That's true.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.233
- He wants to really make it,
you know--

08:29.233 --> 08:30.400
- Make it a thing.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.300
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.433
- So we'll see--hey, it could
be an absolute bloody disaster.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.767
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:35.767 --> 08:37.300
- Here he is.
Talk of the devil.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.000
- Speak of the devil,
have a seat.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.567
I'm gonna, like, get going.

08:40.567 --> 08:41.700
- Yep.
- All right.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.667
- Yeah, I'm good.

08:44.667 --> 08:47.166
How much effort have you
put into this Tuesday night?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.700
- Apart from the promoting
and everything,

08:48.700 --> 08:50.266
I feel like
the name's everything.

08:50.266 --> 08:51.633
You know, it makes
people want to go out.

08:51.633 --> 08:53.033
- Turn Up Tuesday.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.300
- Turn Up Tuesday, yeah.
- Yeah.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.433
- We're--we're gonna
put that in the trash

08:56.433 --> 08:58.133
and I thought of
something way better.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.700
James Kennedy presents...
you ready?

08:59.700 --> 09:03.000
- Yeah.
- See You Next Tuesday.

09:04.734 --> 09:07.333
- Yeah, 'cause it's
every other Tuesday at Sur.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.533
And look, I even
spelt the "See."

09:09.533 --> 09:11.333
So it's not a "C,"
it's not, you know,

09:11.333 --> 09:13.133
it's S-E-E.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.600
- I know what it stands for.
I'm not stupid as I look.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.166
And these are out already?
- Yeah.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.166
I posted them everywhere
last night.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.667
- Well, thanks for
giving me the heads-up.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.333
I mean, of course,
James Kennedy's gonna

09:22.333 --> 09:24.066
call his party night
"See You Next Tuesday."

09:26.033 --> 09:27.300
- I mean, I think I've
called him that myself.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.066
- You know, I feel like
it's gonna be a great night.

09:31.066 --> 09:32.066
I feel like
it's something fresh,

09:32.066 --> 09:33.467
really worked hard on it.

09:33.467 --> 09:34.734
- Okay, and you make sure
you behave yourself.

09:34.734 --> 09:35.734
- I will.
- 'Cause I'm giving you

09:35.734 --> 09:37.300
this chance, okay?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.000
- Yeah.
- But now, this is your night.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.233
This isn't you working for me,
you understand that?

09:40.233 --> 09:42.233
- Yeah, you're right.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.367
This is make or break it
for James Kennedy.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.467
It's the first time I've been
given an exclusive opportunity

09:46.467 --> 09:48.433
back at Sur.

09:48.433 --> 09:51.467
I even made flyers to hand them
out on Santa Monica Boulevard

09:51.467 --> 09:53.767
sweating like
a ----ing prostitute

09:53.767 --> 09:55.367
just to make
this party happen.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.166
Beautiful girls,
See You Tuesday party.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.767
I'm deejaying all night.
Two for one.

09:58.767 --> 10:01.433
I'll see you Tuesday, pal.
All righty, all righty.

10:01.433 --> 10:04.367
What's going on, guys?
I'll see you Tuesday.

10:04.367 --> 10:06.467
I want to do
really well.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.433
So that means no drinking,
obviously, at the party

10:08.433 --> 10:10.066
and turning up.
- Obviously.

10:10.066 --> 10:11.367
- I mean, I feel like
I'm pretty much good

10:11.367 --> 10:13.233
to not drink for a week
after last night,

10:13.233 --> 10:15.233
because I'm hurting
this morning.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.166
Jax had
a housewarming party.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.500
- Ridiculous--in light of
what's going on, ridiculous.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.100
- And you know
he banged Faith.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.266
- I know.

10:22.266 --> 10:23.600
- Well,
there was a recording.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.667
Faith basically recorded

10:25.667 --> 10:27.133
like, the aftermath
of them talking,

10:27.133 --> 10:28.467
huffing and puffing
in bed.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.266
- Yeah.

10:30.266 --> 10:34.000
Like, Brittany was
like this, "Why?"

10:34.000 --> 10:36.266
Literally.

10:36.266 --> 10:37.533
It was awful.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.266
And then I walk into
the guys' apartment

10:39.266 --> 10:41.233
and they--and Jax is...

10:43.000 --> 10:44.667
- No, he was sitting just,
like, nodding his head...

10:44.667 --> 10:46.400
What do you mean?
- Just huffing and puffing.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.734
"Who put out the tape?
Did you "

10:47.734 --> 10:49.767
I was like,
"Ariana and Lala did it."

10:49.767 --> 10:51.600
I've done nothing wrong.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.000
I actually stole the recording
off Faith's phone.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.333
I, like, took her phone
to the bathroom

10:56.333 --> 10:58.266
and I sent it to myself.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.600
- Just concentrate on getting
your night out there

11:01.600 --> 11:04.033
and making it successful,
please, and behave yourself.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.567
- I'm not gonna
let you down.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.033
- I will see you
next Tuesday.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.233

13:29.467 --> 13:31.133
I didn't bring it up
in front of everybody.

I was gonna hear that.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.667

"No, I'm not doing that."

- Listen.
- You could have said no.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.667
- Trying to blame me
that it was you...

13:38.667 --> 13:39.767
- You shouldn't have
brought it out.

13:41.233 --> 13:42.600
Jax got embarrassed.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.066
He got embarrassed that
he got caught,

13:44.066 --> 13:46.533
and now he instantly
turns around

13:46.533 --> 13:48.633
and is like, "You did this
to me, you hurt me."

13:48.633 --> 13:50.433
That's a crock
of bullsh--.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.767
I was hammered.
- Even Tom and Tom

13:51.767 --> 13:53.400
are going off on Ariana
and everybody

13:53.400 --> 13:55.767
because of what they did,
it was--it was so wrong.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.433
It was so wrong
in so many ways.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.166
- You are losing it.
- I cannot deal with

14:00.166 --> 14:02.266
someone telling me that
I'm making sh-- up.

14:02.266 --> 14:04.033
- Love each other,
come on.

14:04.033 --> 14:06.033
- I, like, literally sat here
and tried to explain

14:06.033 --> 14:09.133
as best as I could every little
thing that went into it.

14:09.133 --> 14:11.367
Tom does this thing every time
he disagrees

14:11.367 --> 14:14.367
with the way that
I handled a situation.

14:14.367 --> 14:16.233
He starts talking about
what he would have done

14:16.233 --> 14:18.133
in the situation,
and if I'd just done

14:18.133 --> 14:21.433
what he would have done, things
would be so much better now.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.166
Point blank,
it feels like sh--.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.767
The one person whose opinion
means the most to me

14:25.767 --> 14:27.767
is telling me that
they're disappointed in me.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.433
- All I'm saying is
take ----ing responsibility

14:29.433 --> 14:30.567
for your ----ing actions!

14:30.567 --> 14:32.533
That's all I'm asking,

14:32.533 --> 14:36.333
and you don't do that ever
in our ----ing relationship!

14:36.333 --> 14:38.200
- In my house.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.734
- Okay, well, then get mad
at them, not me.

14:39.734 --> 14:41.400
I had no--I'm the one
who got hurt here!

14:41.400 --> 14:42.667

like this, going,

14:42.667 --> 14:44.433
"You guys all wanna
hear this?"

14:44.433 --> 14:46.266
- Yeah, because I was drunk
and I was pissed off.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.000
And I have the right to be.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.066
- Yes, you have a right
to do it between you and I.

14:50.066 --> 14:52.166
I am not dating ----ing
the rest of this ----ing group!

14:52.166 --> 14:53.467

I'm talking about!

because you're low!

14:58.333 --> 15:00.133
Go--go try and ruin
another girl's life.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.333
You will, I know it.
You're dirty.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.734

it up in front of everybody!

brought it out, dumb-ass!

15:11.166 --> 15:12.533

15:12.533 --> 15:14.500

not mine!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.500

16:36.333 --> 16:38.033
- Yeah.
- You know, sometimes, like,

16:38.033 --> 16:40.667
drama happens and I just,
like, kind of stay away.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.700
Like, I went through,
like, a breakup

16:42.700 --> 16:44.567
right before
I started here.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.233
It's just nice to
start something new,

16:46.233 --> 16:48.300
like a new chapter
and new friends, you know.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.233
- Okay. How are you doing
with that? You feel--

16:50.233 --> 16:52.133
- Yeah, I mean, we were off
and on for, like, three years

16:52.133 --> 16:54.700
and I can't have kids
'cause I'm trans,

16:54.700 --> 16:56.700
and so he's like--
it just bothered him.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.500
He's like, "I want to have
my own kids."

16:58.500 --> 17:00.533
Broke my heart, but it's good.
- Oh, poor baby.

17:00.533 --> 17:02.400
I can't even describe to you

17:02.400 --> 17:04.166
how much I love and adore
Billie.

17:04.166 --> 17:08.033
She's genuine.
She's open about who she is.

17:08.033 --> 17:10.433
She just embodies
everything

17:10.433 --> 17:12.667
that a human being
should embody.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.433
She has great tits, too.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.133
I'm excited that
we're working together.

17:16.133 --> 17:18.233
- I know.
- This is like--

17:18.233 --> 17:20.066
- You're, like, the only host
that I'm, like, vibing with.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.567
I'm like, you know, that I can
just, like, kick it with

17:21.567 --> 17:23.300
after work.
- Well, let me get your number,

17:23.300 --> 17:25.200
like, before we part ways.
- Yeah.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.300
- And any time we do anything,
dude, I'll totally invite you.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.734
- Okay.
- I would love that.

17:28.734 --> 17:30.400
both: Yeah.
- I'm gonna make sure

17:30.400 --> 17:32.066
that we have more
cocktail menus over here.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.734
I'll run next door real quick.
- Okay.

17:33.734 --> 17:35.600
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

What's more exclusive

17:55.700 --> 17:58.200
than going to a place that
doesn't even have a sign

17:58.200 --> 18:00.200
and is, like, hidden
behind a bookshelf?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.767
Like, you're not gonna find
commoners there.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.300
That was so cool.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.767
- What's that,
the speakeasy?

18:04.767 --> 18:06.100

18:13.066 --> 18:14.367
- You look so
New York right now.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.734
- I am.
It's nice to see you.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.467
You look good.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.767
Your eyes are glowing.

18:18.767 --> 18:21.500
- They are.
They're vibrant.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.367
- Ever since Tom met Patrick,
he's always had

18:23.367 --> 18:25.100
a bit of a man crush
on him.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.500
I mean, look at what
Tom is wearing.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.367
He doesn't dress
like that for me.

18:28.367 --> 18:30.233
I have to beg him to
put regular pants

18:30.233 --> 18:32.033
and shoes on
half the time.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.500
You guys, decide what you want
to drink real quick.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.233
- Casamigos is good.

18:35.233 --> 18:36.600
- He likes Jager bombs.
He's just too shy to ask.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.700
- No Jager bombs.
- No.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.467
- No.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.233
- He's been a bad boy.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.500
- I put myself in bad
situations sometimes, you know?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.367
I'm sorry, Patrick, I'm sorry
you have to hear this.

18:45.367 --> 18:48.100
I got--I got sh--faced
and I made out with some chick

18:48.100 --> 18:49.600
apparently, anyways,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.233
who happened to be
a friend of Lala.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.233
And I'm so sorry, Bubby.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.233
Everyone's like,
"Dude, you don't remember?"

18:55.233 --> 18:56.734
I'm like, "No, I don't
----ing remember."

18:56.734 --> 18:59.133
Not even like a shred.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.667
Patrick, I mean, the guy
is good at adulting.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.333
I mean, he's got
his own radio show.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.000
- You don't remember it,
it's over.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.066
- And I'm over here
explaining how

19:07.066 --> 19:10.533
I apparently got blackout drunk
and made out with some chick.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.133
I gotta get
my sh-- together.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.000
- Cheers.
- To--like, wait.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.533
I'm, like, sitting here with
three of my favorite people.

19:15.533 --> 19:16.767
- Cheers to
the file people.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.467
- Cheers.
- I'm glad you guys

19:18.467 --> 19:19.667
are back together.
You guys make a good couple.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.133
- I know.
- You look good together.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.734
both: Thank you.
- More importantly,

19:22.734 --> 19:24.266
you look good together.
- My guard's so down,

19:24.266 --> 19:25.767
I'm a little
intimidated by you.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.367
- 'Cause your wit is so

19:27.367 --> 19:29.433
on point and I--you know,
I strive to be witty

19:29.433 --> 19:31.266
and I love--I love words.
- Just go faster.

19:31.266 --> 19:32.700
Keep up.
- You know, I have

19:32.700 --> 19:34.166
a penchant for words.
I'm a little hungover,

19:34.166 --> 19:36.000
but I have been
in an existential funk.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.500
- Listen, it's gonna rain.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.433
You can only control
how you react to the rain.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.700
- Yes.
I actually like that.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.367
- You can bring an umbrella.
- Yeah.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.166
Sh-- was going down last night.
- I know.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.300
- It was bad.
It was so bad.

19:47.300 --> 19:50.100
- So, along with Jax
cheating on Brittany

19:50.100 --> 19:52.567
with this girl named Faith,
who was friends with Brittany,

19:52.567 --> 19:55.166
and this girl Faith was
such a crazy snake,

19:55.166 --> 19:57.433
she recorded a postcoital
conversation...

19:57.433 --> 19:59.300
- Oh, God.
- Between her and Jax--

19:59.300 --> 20:01.166
- Wait, so they hit it
and then they're laying there

20:01.166 --> 20:02.433
and she recorded what
they talked about?

20:02.433 --> 20:04.233
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

20:04.233 --> 20:07.066
- If your friends are
a reflection of who you are

20:07.066 --> 20:09.533
as a person, then what does
Patrick think about me?

20:09.533 --> 20:12.133
Like, yeah, you know
that sociopath

20:12.133 --> 20:13.533
who cheated
on his girlfriend

20:13.533 --> 20:15.734
which was captured
on audio

20:15.734 --> 20:17.467
and then played at
a housewarming party?

20:17.467 --> 20:20.467
That's who I dated
before you.

20:20.467 --> 20:21.700
- That's romantic.

20:27.066 --> 20:28.567
- I love the studio,
you know,

20:28.567 --> 20:30.433
'cause I know that it's,
like, in Burbank,

20:30.433 --> 20:32.333
but it's like a nice distance
away from all the sh--.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.066
- No, I like getting
into Burbank.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.667
- Yeah, it's a lot chiller.
- I love getting into

20:35.667 --> 20:37.600
the studio out here.
It's like Zen mood, you know?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.700
- I feel like I'm going
to band practice.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.166
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yo, yo.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.533
How are you?

20:43.533 --> 20:45.200
- Good, man.
Good to see you.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.633
- Hello, nice to see you again.
- You, too.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.300
- Yes, sir.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.734
- Awesome. Tom,
just in case you forgot.

20:52.734 --> 20:54.300
- So what are we
doing today, man?

20:54.300 --> 20:56.166
What's new?

20:56.166 --> 20:58.500
Today we're recording Lala
that's gonna be singing,

20:58.500 --> 20:59.734
like, a sample.
- Okay.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.600
And then Tom brought
a trumpet,

21:01.600 --> 21:03.500
so we're gonna do
some light instruments today.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.333
Professionally, my deejay
career is taking off, you know.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.767
I'm producing a lot.
I'm remixing.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.233
I'm really just trying to show
everybody else that

21:11.233 --> 21:14.633
I'm growing up into a man
that wants to work hard

21:14.633 --> 21:17.500
and stop ----ing up his--
his opportunities.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.066
- Let me go get set up
for that.

21:19.066 --> 21:20.600
- All right, sweet.
Thank you, man.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.633
- Cool, thanks, man.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.567
,
but I'm good.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.233
- Hey, what's up
with Tuesday?

21:26.233 --> 21:27.500
- I don't know why
I think the way I do,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.367
but I think people
want me to fail.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.000
- Honey.
Why am I such--

21:31.000 --> 21:32.734
- Just don't give them
any reason--

21:32.734 --> 21:34.266
don't give 'em any ----ing--
- I'm not.

21:34.266 --> 21:36.133
I'm not gonna give them
any reason.

21:36.133 --> 21:39.400
- I am so pumped
for James's deejay day,

21:39.400 --> 21:41.333
because that's my boy.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.266
When he got fired
from Sur,

21:43.266 --> 21:45.200
I was really devastated.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.667
So to have him back

21:46.667 --> 21:48.600
on the mother ship,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.767
oh, honey,
it's about to go down.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.133
- Let's go. We're ready.
Are you ready?

21:57.133 --> 21:59.400
- Play it back real quick
so I can see what's going on.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.100

What are you eating?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.233

24:13.233 --> 24:14.367

24:14.367 --> 24:17.133

24:19.000 --> 24:20.133
- I'm okay.

24:20.133 --> 24:21.767
- We just saw Jax.

24:21.767 --> 24:24.100
- He stays in that room,
never comes out or anything.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.533
Honestly, we haven't even,
like, really seen each other,

24:26.533 --> 24:28.266

'cause we're in the same house.

24:28.266 --> 24:30.100

24:32.467 --> 24:35.400
Hi, buddy.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.500

come back home.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.233
- I know that.

24:38.233 --> 24:39.667
He's a different person

24:39.667 --> 24:42.767

I don't know.

24:42.767 --> 24:46.500
I just want to like be around,
like, my friends and stuff.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.767
- Seeing Brittany so upset
because Jax cheated on her,

24:49.767 --> 24:52.133
it's like déjà vu.

24:52.133 --> 24:54.266
I remember
this feeling.

24:54.266 --> 24:56.333
Six years ago,
I was in this position.

24:56.333 --> 24:59.266
- I did go to Vegas and have
relations with somebody else.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.133

I'm like--I'm just,
like, really hurt.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.300
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be doing this.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.200
I'm just--

34:22.200 --> 34:24.567
I'm just really,
really, really sad.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.333
- You're making me cry.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.467
What does Jax
need to do

34:30.467 --> 34:32.667
for Brittany
to understand

34:32.667 --> 34:34.467
that this relationship

34:34.467 --> 34:37.400
is not beneficial
to her?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.066
You've got a lot
of friends here.

34:39.066 --> 34:41.200
Everybody loves you,
adores you.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.700
You've got
a good job.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.600
You've got the world
at your feet, okay?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.100
- Yeah.
- Don't give it up for him.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.100
Otherwise that's
him winning, okay?

34:48.100 --> 34:50.200
You don't go running
back to Kentucky.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.500
- I know.
- That's not who you are.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.066
- Lots of people
look at this situation

34:53.066 --> 34:55.467
between Jax and I

34:55.467 --> 34:57.033
as black and white.

34:57.033 --> 34:59.467
He cheated on me,
so I should leave him.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.433
And I always thought
if he cheated on me

35:01.433 --> 35:02.633
I would be gone,

35:02.633 --> 35:05.100
but life is not
black and white.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
- Darling,
you're better than this.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.100
- I know.
I just need to be strong.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.734
I need to get my--

35:10.734 --> 35:13.166
my confidence back up,
and I'll be fine.

35:13.166 --> 35:14.300
- Well,
you're looking beautiful.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.633
- Thanks.

35:15.633 --> 35:17.100
- Better than you've looked
in months.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.300
- Revenge body.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.166
Don't get mad,
get even, right?

35:22.166 --> 35:24.333
- Yeah.
- And then some.

35:27.333 --> 35:32.367
♪ ♪

35:32.367 --> 35:34.200
- Hey.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.667
- Can I talked to you
for, like, five seconds?

35:37.667 --> 35:40.600
So, I know you work
at Toca Madera.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.533
I know Rob used to date
a hostess who worked there.

35:43.533 --> 35:46.400
There's this whole rumor
about him "making out"

35:46.400 --> 35:48.367
with her so--

35:48.367 --> 35:50.133
- I'm--I'm not gonna
get anybody in trouble.

35:50.133 --> 35:52.000
Like, she's one of
my good friends,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.600
so I'm not gonna
sit here and, like--

35:53.600 --> 35:55.533
- I'm not--no,
I literally don't want to

35:55.533 --> 35:57.233
ever speak about this again--it
just keep getting brought up.

35:57.233 --> 35:58.400
- I mean,
long story short,

35:58.400 --> 35:59.533
how it came to me was...
- Yeah.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.133
- She's one of
my girlfriends.

36:01.133 --> 36:02.400
And one day she's like,
"Do you know this girl?"

36:02.400 --> 36:03.767
'Cause obviously
she knows I work at Sur.

36:03.767 --> 36:05.367
And I was like,
"Well, yeah, of course I do."

36:05.367 --> 36:07.233
And she's like,
"Well, that's weird."

36:07.233 --> 36:09.433
She's like, "'Cause this guy
that I used to date,

36:09.433 --> 36:12.400
"I just saw online
he's dating her

36:12.400 --> 36:14.000
and he just kissed me
the other night."

36:14.000 --> 36:15.300
- Yeah, but I asked him,
I was like,

36:15.300 --> 36:17.266
"Okay, so tell me
what happened."

36:17.266 --> 36:18.700
He's like, "I used to date
a girl who worked there.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.533
"I picked her up,
I twirled her around,

36:20.533 --> 36:22.000
and I gave her a kiss
on the cheek,"

36:22.000 --> 36:26.033
or maybe the lips hit,
whatever.

36:26.033 --> 36:28.567
- It was probably a little
more inappropriate than

36:28.567 --> 36:33.033
you would want your boyfriend
to behave with someone.

36:33.033 --> 36:35.100
- Yeah, but I trust Rob

36:35.100 --> 36:36.767
more than anything,

36:36.767 --> 36:40.000
and, like, I know what--
what he told me was the truth,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.700
but because everyone else
is saying things,

36:41.700 --> 36:44.533
I'm like, if I see Jen
and it was her,

36:44.533 --> 36:46.433
I'm just gonna go to
the source and say it.

36:46.433 --> 36:48.467
And you're telling me the exact
same thing he told me,

36:48.467 --> 36:50.700
so it's just the ----ing game
of telephone is so annoying,

36:50.700 --> 36:52.133
so...

36:53.734 --> 36:56.567
Jen Bush, thank you,
that's all I needed to hear.

36:56.567 --> 36:58.433
Case closed, bitches.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.467
I have to get back to work.
See ya. Bye.

37:00.467 --> 37:01.667
- Okay.
- Thank you.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.700
- Yeah, of course.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.333
- I wanted you
to just be like,

37:08.333 --> 37:09.734
maybe we should have
picked a different time...

37:09.734 --> 37:11.166

37:37.500 --> 37:39.233

37:39.233 --> 37:40.767

I was like, where are you at?

37:40.767 --> 37:42.233

I mean, we're just here,

37:56.767 --> 37:59.500
and then there's stuff
going on with other people

and everything, I just
feel like we get wrapped up

38:01.700 --> 38:04.200
in other people's stress
or in the stress of working,

38:04.200 --> 38:06.066
and it--it's not us.

38:06.066 --> 38:08.633
It's not what
I want for us.

38:08.633 --> 38:10.467
- Me neither.

38:10.467 --> 38:13.667
Was that one of our worst
fights we've been in?

38:13.667 --> 38:15.767
I didn't like it
at all.

38:15.767 --> 38:18.533
- I didn't either,
obviously.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.367
- I feel like you got
put in a bad position

38:20.367 --> 38:22.500
because you were given
that information.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.200
- And I was drunk.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.266
I didn't know how to
do right by anybody

38:26.266 --> 38:29.266
and then I understand
it's not the best timing.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.767
I'm like, I know.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.133
- I think what it was is,
I just

38:33.133 --> 38:36.533
wanted you to just be like,
yeah, maybe we--

38:36.533 --> 38:38.100
maybe we should have
picked a different time.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.667
- But we did.
- But I was put on the--

38:39.667 --> 38:41.533
- But we did say that
and that's when I feel like

38:41.533 --> 38:43.767
you just didn't--
you weren't hearing that.

38:43.767 --> 38:45.333
Something Tom could do
that would

38:45.333 --> 38:47.000
really improve
our relationship

38:47.000 --> 38:49.333
is if he would be able to
empathize with me,

38:49.333 --> 38:53.033
and I feel like if I just
didn't take certain things

38:53.033 --> 38:54.166
so personally,

38:54.166 --> 38:56.266
I think that
we would probably

38:56.266 --> 38:58.400
not get into this position
ever again.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.567
- I'm sorry we got mad
at each other.

39:00.567 --> 39:04.300

39:28.000 --> 39:30.700
Stop.
I'm calling your mimi.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.133
- Hi, Mom.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.600
- I'm good.
What are you doing?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.333
- Oh, just got off work, I'm
getting ready to go swimming.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.166
What's going on?

39:41.166 --> 39:43.133

39:43.133 --> 39:45.200

39:45.200 --> 39:47.600
Well, you know it's really
hard when somebody cheats

39:47.600 --> 39:50.000
to ever trust them.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.700
- I don't know.
I just love him so much

39:51.700 --> 39:53.467
that I feel like I should at
least try to work things out.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.166
Maybe it still
won't work out in the end,

39:55.166 --> 39:57.166
but I'm just gonna
make sure, like,

39:57.166 --> 40:00.166
if he ever starts going back
on his old ways

40:00.166 --> 40:02.300
that, you know,
we're not gonna be together.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.066
My mom has been married
four times,

40:05.066 --> 40:08.133
and I've always just wanted
to be with that one person,

40:08.133 --> 40:11.066
that one special marriage
for my entire life.

40:11.066 --> 40:15.066
And if Jax doesn't make
some serious changes,

40:15.066 --> 40:17.033
then I'm gonna
have to move on,

40:17.033 --> 40:19.000
'cause this is not
what's gonna work for me.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.600
- I have been.
I've been praying about it.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.433
I was raised to be
a good Christian woman

40:27.433 --> 40:29.300
and that is all about
forgiveness.

40:29.300 --> 40:32.333
And I believe everybody
deserves it, even Jax.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.633
- Okay, I love you,
too, Mom.

40:35.633 --> 40:37.066
- Okay.

40:37.066 --> 40:39.500
- Bye.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.333
Hello.

40:45.333 --> 40:46.500
- Hey.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.166
Hi, guys.

40:48.166 --> 40:51.367
- I'm so--
it's so hot upstairs.

40:51.367 --> 40:53.200
- I turned
the air-conditioning off.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.200
- Oh, golly, I was about to
sweat through my shirt.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.000
I was talking to
my mom upstairs,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.400
and I was telling her that
it's gonna be hard for a while

41:02.400 --> 41:06.133
but I loved you too much to
not try to work things out.

41:06.133 --> 41:08.467
And there's gonna be a lot of,
like, guidelines

41:08.467 --> 41:10.533
that you're gonna
have to go by.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.533
Like, you are gonna
start therapy, aren't you?

41:12.533 --> 41:14.100
- Mm-hmm.
- I know we're probably gonna

41:14.100 --> 41:15.533
get into arguments
every now and then,

41:15.533 --> 41:17.467
'cause that's just
how life is,

41:17.467 --> 41:20.633
but you know the way you talk
to me has got to change.

41:20.633 --> 41:22.667
- Can we say each other,
talk to each other?

41:24.367 --> 41:28.100
I'm, like, taking a big risk
believing in you.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.233
You understand that,
right?

41:29.233 --> 41:31.200
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.133
- It's a really, really, really
hard and embarrassing thing

41:34.133 --> 41:36.233
It's not that we were able
to just figure this out

41:36.233 --> 41:37.600
by ourselves.
- Well, that's not my fault.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.300
- Actually,
it is your fault.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.266
You can't say
it wasn't your fault.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.533
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter,

41:43.533 --> 41:45.433
because you're the one
who did it.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.166
So you cannot--you cannot act
like it was not your fault.

41:47.166 --> 41:49.000
- I didn't say
it wasn't my fault.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.567
- You just did, though.
- Of course it was my fault.

41:50.567 --> 41:52.700
But I mean, I would have
handled it a lot differently.

41:52.700 --> 41:54.300
It's a double-edged sword.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.700
I mean,
it takes two to argue.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.266
It takes two to make
a relationship work.

41:57.266 --> 41:59.367
So, you know,
it's not all me.

41:59.367 --> 42:00.767
Yes, I've done
a very bad thing.

42:00.767 --> 42:02.567
Yes, cheating is
absolutely wrong,

42:02.567 --> 42:04.400
but what did it do
for me to do that?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
- You promised me that
you were gonna change, right?

42:06.400 --> 42:07.567
- Mm-hmm.

42:09.233 --> 42:11.300
- I know what I have to do.
I know.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.033
But, you know,
you can at least

42:13.033 --> 42:16.000
hit the pause button for
a second and chill out.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Give me just one day
without it, would be great.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.300
- Mm, no.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.033
- God.
- You don't deserve that.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.266
I will kick your ass
if I ever hear anything again.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.033
Nothing will ever
happen again.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.000
I promise.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.200
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:33.200 --> 42:34.333
Happy Pride.

42:36.166 --> 42:37.467
- I wanna do
a shot outta--

42:37.467 --> 42:39.567
- I tried to introduce
Rob into this group

42:39.567 --> 42:41.433
and now I feel miserable.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.000
It's drama that
he doesn't need.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.734
Why are they trying
to bring us down?

42:44.734 --> 42:46.200
We've been perfect.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.734
with my bitch,

42:47.734 --> 42:49.734
'cause I will
with your fat  man!

42:49.734 --> 42:51.400
- Learn your ----ing place,
mother----er!

42:51.400 --> 42:53.166
I'm out.

42:53.166 --> 42:56.166
- Never in the history
of Jax's 38 years of living

42:56.166 --> 42:58.567
has he ever broken up
with a girlfriend.

43:00.567 --> 43:02.734
Mom,
what are you doing?

43:02.734 --> 43:04.367
