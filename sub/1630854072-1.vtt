00:40.081 --> 00:42.792
<i>Man, thought you'd be</i>
<i>off the clock by five,</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.754
<i>they keep you on call. Shitluck.</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:48.089
<i>Cap said I could leave</i>
<i>my gun and badge</i>

00:48.173 --> 00:50.091
<i>if I went home to listen to my old lady</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:55.138
<i>go on and on about her online shopping</i>
<i>or whatever the hell she did all day.</i>

00:55.221 --> 00:58.016
<i>That’s what you get</i>
<i>for choosing the life of a public servant.</i>

00:58.099 --> 01:00.477
<i>It just had to fucking rain.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:03.146
Hmm? What the hell you doin'? Back it up.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.314
Looking to get shot?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.218
Got us a cyber psycho!

01:33.885 --> 01:35.720
Raise MaxTac now!

02:31.234 --> 02:32.902
We need to fry the system fast.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.155
Freak's supporting military-grade ICE!

02:35.238 --> 02:37.866
Meaning that our tech isn't? Get to it!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.327
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

03:22.952 --> 03:25.330
<i>Still warm, that. Couple hours old.</i>

03:25.413 --> 03:27.540
<i>Lifted from the edgerunner</i>
<i>who scrolled it.</i>

03:27.624 --> 03:29.292
<i>Straight off the street.</i>

03:29.375 --> 03:30.793
So, what!

03:30.877 --> 03:34.172
Doc, hey, you gotta tell me
who keeps feeding you these nuggets.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.632
<i>Kurosaki. Who else?</i>

03:35.715 --> 03:38.801
<i>Ain't no other editor who churns out</i>
<i>BDs that sweet and preem.</i>

03:38.885 --> 03:41.137
<i>Won't pull nothin' like that</i>
<i>off the shelf, neither.</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:44.307
No shit. Brain's still buzzing.
Gonna be sick.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.392
<i>Slow, deep breaths, choom.</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:49.145
<i>Just left the head</i>
<i>of a skezzed-out chrome junkie.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.147
<i>Cyberpsychosis ain't no joke.</i>

03:51.231 --> 03:54.359
<i>Anyway, either hurt or don't,</i>
<i>got more chips for you to slot.</i>

03:54.442 --> 03:55.818
Really? What?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.071
<i>Something special.</i>

03:59.322 --> 04:01.824
Huh? Cut the shit, man!

04:12.085 --> 04:15.505
Huh?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.424
<i>Cycle suspended</i>
<i>due to insufficient funds.</i>

04:18.508 --> 04:21.511
-Geez, not again.
-<i>Cycle suspended due to in--</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:23.846
<i>It was a tragic scene</i>
<i>in Westbrook today</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:25.014
<i>when a corporate convoy</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:27.892
<i>-was ambushed by 6th Street…</i>
-God, Mom.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.271
Morning, Miho.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.106
If you keep sleeping on the couch,

04:33.189 --> 04:35.066
gonna get early onset arthritis.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.902
I know. Just dead
after my night shift, is all.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.281
You and the washing machine both.
Forget to re-up it?

04:41.364 --> 04:42.907
Yeah.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.867
I'll take care of it later, 'kay?

04:44.951 --> 04:48.162
Oh, money, right.
You mentioned a reef update for class.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.123
That happen yet?
When did you say you need it?

04:50.206 --> 04:54.043
No, no. It's fine. Got Doc to handle it.

04:54.877 --> 04:58.172
-What do you mean "handle it"?
-I'm good. All set.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.341
Don't go cutting corners, D.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.429
Already cashed my paycheck.
You'll get it updated right. Hear me?

05:04.512 --> 05:07.348
Mom, seriously!
Just feed the washer, alright?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.809
I forgot this time. I told you.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.520
Promise me you'll buy the update.

05:12.603 --> 05:14.439
Okay, okay.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.358
And you're really going to school
dressed like that?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.609
Uniform’s soaked.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.111
<i>A military-grade implant…</i>

05:20.194 --> 05:21.446
-<i>…was found missing from the body</i>
-Hmm?

05:21.529 --> 05:24.449
<i>of Lt. Col. James Norris,</i>
<i>shot dead by MaxTac…</i>

05:24.532 --> 05:27.827
Mom, you're on TV! Nova!

05:27.910 --> 05:30.705
Not Nova, David. A bloodbath.

05:30.788 --> 05:34.042
-Go on. Off to school.
-Bye.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.668
Love you, Miho.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.468
<i>Maine? It's Gloria.</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:54.062
Hmm…

06:31.057 --> 06:34.310
<i>Trauma Team.</i>
<i>Clear a path immediately.</i>

06:34.894 --> 06:38.147
<i>Emergency evac underway. Emergency evac.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:40.900
<i>All AVs, vacate the airway.</i>

06:40.983 --> 06:45.321
<i>Trauma Team. Clear a path immediately.</i>
<i>Trauma Team. Clear a path.</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:46.572
<i>Don't walk.</i>

06:48.241 --> 06:49.325
<i>Don't walk.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:55.081
<i>Walk. Walk. Walk.</i>

06:55.164 --> 06:57.583
<i>Walk. Walk.</i>

07:32.201 --> 07:35.163
Huh?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.815
Good morning to you, class.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.818
Today's attendance. Zero absences.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.487
Martinez, David.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.156
You are not in compliance
with the Academy's dress code.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.158
Yeah. Real sorry about that.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.327
Afraid my uniform's still
at the cleaner's.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.370
Do you have a spare uniform?

08:16.454 --> 08:17.914
Yeah. Spare's there too.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.001
Understood. Please submit
a Uniform Exception form after class.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.337
Now, let us begin today's lesson.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.882
-You will observe…
-<i>Gutter rat. Rat off the street.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:30.468
<i>Me? Nah. Wouldn't show my face.</i>

08:30.551 --> 08:34.138
<i>Cray-crazy, I know,</i>
<i>but some of us here to learn to learn.</i>

08:34.222 --> 08:36.015
<i>With that fossiltech?</i>

08:36.098 --> 08:38.601
<i>Updates, man. Bet it's not compatible.</i>

08:38.684 --> 08:40.603
<i>I made it compatible.</i>

08:40.686 --> 08:42.522
<i>Huh? How?</i>

08:42.605 --> 08:44.106
<i>How I had to.</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:45.816
<i>Life's gotta be gotta be shit</i>

08:45.900 --> 08:48.361
<i>when a two-bit wreath</i>
<i>costs your life savings.</i>

08:48.444 --> 08:49.278
At this time,

08:49.362 --> 08:52.782
I ask all students
to log into the Green Room for meditation.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.367
Countin’ on ya, Doc.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.623
-<i>Seriously?</i>
-What?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.416
<i>Martinez again!</i>

09:02.500 --> 09:05.878
<i>Not again!</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:11.968
I’m so sorry
for the inconvenience my son has caused.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.346
I wouldn't call this
a matter of money, Mrs. Martinez.

09:15.429 --> 09:19.475
Although I must say it was quite
an expense for us to restore the system.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.270
Of course,
and I will pay for the repairs.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.187
Hmm?

09:23.271 --> 09:26.899
As I understand it,
Mr. Martinez modified his headset

09:26.983 --> 09:30.945
with backalley software
to avoid paying for the licensed update.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.782
This is not behavior befitting a pupil
from a financially stable home.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.910
It's not a problem, really.
We can afford it.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.161
Be that as it may,

09:39.245 --> 09:41.998
I see an opportunity here
to improve David's situation.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.165
Meaning what, exactly?

09:43.249 --> 09:46.127
David is not a good fit
with his classmates.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.547
He could benefit
from a change in environment.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.758
No! Wait, please.
I mean, he has to stay here.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.304
He deserves this education as much
as every other child in this school.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.140
What happened?
Didn't I tell you to get the upgrade?

09:59.223 --> 10:02.351
Yeah. Doc's damn fault.
Gave me a faulty port drive.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.937
You tried to get around
the system, didn't you?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.356
Now, it'll cost us ten times more.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.774
Sorry.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.401
If it's something
you gotta apologize for,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.486
maybe don't do it in the first place, hey?

10:12.570 --> 10:14.989
You said you didn't have
the eddies when I asked, so…

10:15.072 --> 10:16.824
I was waiting for payday!

10:16.907 --> 10:19.994
You know we don't got that kind of cash
just lying around.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.039
Can't you sit still a minute?

10:25.333 --> 10:28.085
You know,
I've been thinkin’ lately.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.587
About what?

10:29.670 --> 10:33.215
Maybe I drop out.
Find some work or whatever.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.884
Do you hear yourself?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.928
C'mon, seriously.
You know we can't afford those repairs.

10:39.013 --> 10:43.726
Plus, you got no idea just how bad
I stand out compared to all of them.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.396
Anyone sides a true blue corpo
gets shit on.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.398
Even if I do graduate,
they'll never accept me.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.026
No kid from Santo will ever be a suit.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.028
I don't wanna be one anyway.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.824
So, you tell me.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.452
What have I been busting
my ass for then, huh?

11:02.119 --> 11:05.498
Everything I do, I do for you, D.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.874
Don't you see that?

11:06.957 --> 11:11.087
You're breaking my heart, Miho.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.171
Wait. What?

11:12.254 --> 11:16.842
My sweet baby boy. So smart, so talented.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.177
You're everything to me.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.098
I want to give you a fighting chance
in this city and a good education.

11:22.181 --> 11:26.977
It's why I put in all of those hours.
Why I'm never home.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.648
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:31.273 --> 11:35.069
Shouldn't have brought it up.
Don't cry, Mom.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.780
Think I don't know
how they treat you?

11:37.863 --> 11:39.782
Think I don't get treated the same way?

11:41.075 --> 11:43.619
But that's why you gotta prove them wrong.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.955
You have to work hard
and rise through the ranks.

11:46.038 --> 11:50.084
My son at Arasaka Tower top floor!
I can just see it.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.628
You've got this, D. You're my son.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.922
Yeah, well, easier said than done.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.425
Huh?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.888
Fuck 'em up!

12:05.433 --> 12:08.686
-Don't let 'em get away!
-Suit's limo's titanium plated!

12:08.769 --> 12:11.230
The hunt's on, my beastbros!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.618
No one fucks with the Animals!

12:24.702 --> 12:27.246
-Suckers…
-Mom! Brake! Brake hard!

12:27.329 --> 12:28.831
Watch out!

12:40.134 --> 12:42.636
Mom? Mom!

12:50.436 --> 12:53.439
Is that the Trauma Team? Oh, thank Christ.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.693
He's not a client.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.236
Neither is she.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.279
Hey, wait!

13:00.362 --> 13:03.949
Secure the policyholder.
Leave them to the city meat wagons.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.743
-Copy that.
-What?

13:05.826 --> 13:08.496
What the hell? Hey! Where are you going?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.748
Shit!

13:10.831 --> 13:12.750
No way. Just gonna leave us here?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.753
Mom! Momma!

13:15.836 --> 13:17.755
Mom, wake up!

13:17.838 --> 13:19.757
Fucking piece of…

13:19.840 --> 13:24.303
Mom! Dammit, get off me!

13:24.386 --> 13:28.015
Shit. Get the fuck off!
Dammit!

13:28.098 --> 13:31.060
Mom!

13:31.143 --> 13:32.520
Fuck!

13:36.482 --> 13:38.108
Surgery was a success.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.237
Your mother hasn't come to just yet,
but she's stable.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.447
Need her to stay a few more nights.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.825
Oh. Then, is it okay if I see her?

13:45.908 --> 13:49.578
No can do, buddy.
Visitation ain't part of your package.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.080
Oh. Right.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.041
Anyway, I should get started
on the paperwork.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.543
Brought your mom's things.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.504
And don't forget to zip us those eds.
Got three days.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.089
-Uh…
-Yeah.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.507
There's a reason everyone
in Night City

14:01.590 --> 14:03.175
wants insurance.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
Stay safe now.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.513
Yeah, hoop ship. Version back.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.808
Is that all? You low-balling me? Huh?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.811
Nah, forget it, choom.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.397
Dammit! Hmm?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.651
What the fuck?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.035
Another account. Christ.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.581
Just enough. She saved so much.
Never knew.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.584
So, that, it settled the medical.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.547
Still gotta cover rent. Huh?

14:42.172 --> 14:45.801
Doc? Hey, you get the still I sent?
Listen.

14:45.885 --> 14:50.055
Don't think I'd forgotten I owe you a kick
in the nuts for that shoddy bootleg.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.640
But check this.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.392
Cyberware.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.855
Yeah, looks, uh, military, doesn't it?

14:57.938 --> 14:59.565
How do you think it would fetch

14:59.648 --> 15:02.526
if I was interested
and the price was right?

15:03.319 --> 15:05.154
Not selling. Just want an estimate.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.951
Nah, fuck that noise.
No way it's that cheap.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.956
Oh, come on, choom.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.085
Whatev! Wasn't selling anyways.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.923
By the way. Don't expect me
to push your XBDs at school anymore!

15:25.716 --> 15:28.469
Any pinchin' hack had taken me for a gonk.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.639
A Sandevistan.

15:31.722 --> 15:36.143
No serial number and what?
Military-grade, this thing, really?

15:36.226 --> 15:39.188
It definitely ain't legal. But whatev.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.690
Whoa! The hell are these specs?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.622
Huh? Ah!

16:02.044 --> 16:04.505
Little piece of advice, Martinez.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.424
-Learn to take a hint.
-About what?

16:07.508 --> 16:10.344
Our class.
You're not welcome. Got it?

16:10.427 --> 16:11.971
Huh? If this is about yesterday--

16:12.054 --> 16:14.264
-Who said anything about yesterday?
-What?

16:14.348 --> 16:17.935
You probably figure I give you a hard time
'cause you're poor. Simply untrue.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.020
I'm rather charitably inclined.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.523
Not your fault you were born
on the wrong side of society.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.401
There's no rule
that says a street kid

16:25.484 --> 16:26.902
can't make it at the Academy,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.654
provided they pay their way.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.490
What cracks my chrome
is something else entirely.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.908
-Know what?
-Look, choom.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.327
I haven't understood
a single thing coming out of your mouth.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.745
-That right there!
-Hmm…

16:36.829 --> 16:39.498
Time to get gone.
Just drop out, why don't ya?

16:39.581 --> 16:41.709
-Huh?
-You're a misfit, an anomaly.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.004
Human but trash, and there's nothing
that can change that.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.382
Rot in you runs as deep
as your bones, Martinez.

16:48.465 --> 16:51.885
Best you can do
is not spread it to the rest of us.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.512
Did I just short-circ?

16:53.595 --> 16:56.473
Said you didn't care
as long as I paid tuition.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.976
I heard your mommy came in
to see the principal,

16:59.059 --> 17:01.270
ask forgiveness for your little stunt.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.563
Caused quite a scene,

17:02.646 --> 17:05.607
crying for her baby boy,
begging for him not to get expelled.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.900
So shameless.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.695
You know, since we're chatting,
I've just always wondered.

17:09.778 --> 17:13.157
How could she afford to send you
to Arasaka Academy anyway?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.160
Care to explain, Martinez?

17:16.744 --> 17:20.414
Go on. Tell us.
How does Mommy pay your way?

17:20.497 --> 17:22.791
What's any Night City bottomfeeder

17:22.875 --> 17:24.918
do to make a quick eurobuck, huh?

17:25.002 --> 17:28.547
Oh! A couple of pretty
salacious things come to mind.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.673
Tired of this shit.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.676
-Hold on, choom. Who said we were done?
-Fuck off!

17:41.977 --> 17:45.314
Huh? Oh? What?

17:45.397 --> 17:48.650
Huh? Ha!

17:53.113 --> 17:56.533
Got anything slotted?
Anime freeware maybe?

17:56.617 --> 18:01.538
Hmm? Hmm. Aww!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.102
I knew it.

18:23.185 --> 18:28.065
Nothing like the Strongarms 400 to bring
out the best in your kung-fu chipware.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.442
Organic knuckles? Seriously?

18:30.526 --> 18:34.071
Wanna try me again?
I suggest you pack some serious chrome.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.989
Or just drop out.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.575
You know what I'd prefer.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.625
<i>Mr. Martinez?</i>

18:47.459 --> 18:51.213
<i>I'm calling in regards</i>
<i>to Gloria Martinez's condition.</i>

18:51.880 --> 18:54.258
-Huh?
-She was stable this morning,

18:54.341 --> 18:57.719
but then her vitals began to nosedive
really out of nowhere.

18:57.803 --> 19:02.599
But you said the surgery was successful.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.019
True. But only so much
we can do on the discount package.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.189
Worn down as she was,
I doubt she'd had lasted much longer.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.233
Overworked, seemed to me.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.486
Anyway, I'm supposed to tell you
we offer some burial options.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.865
People in Night City
want corpo gigs for a reason, kid.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.869
<i>Greetings, valued</i>
<i>customer. We are sorry for your loss.</i>

19:21.952 --> 19:23.912
<i>To ease things at this difficult time,</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:26.081
<i>we can deliver the body</i>
<i>of your dearly departed</i>

19:26.165 --> 19:28.250
<i>to your home or to a funeral home.</i>

19:28.333 --> 19:29.501
<i>Would you like to learn more?</i>

19:29.585 --> 19:31.128
I got a choice?

19:31.211 --> 19:33.797
<i>Is our budget-friendly</i>
<i>cremation service right for you?</i>

19:33.881 --> 19:37.968
<i>Waive those pesky delivery fees</i>
<i>and bring your loved one home today.</i>

19:46.059 --> 19:47.186
<i>Don't walk.</i>

19:47.269 --> 19:48.937
-<i>Good day, Mrs. Martinez.</i>
<i>-Don't walk.</i>

19:49.021 --> 19:50.522
-<i>We've received a quote for the repairs</i>
-<i>Don't walk.</i>

19:50.606 --> 19:52.149
-<i>to our system infrastructure.</i>
-<i>Don't walk.</i>

19:52.232 --> 19:55.652
<i>As agreed, I've sent you an e-mail</i>
<i>with the payment details.</i>

19:55.736 --> 19:57.487
<i>Also, perhaps you've had time to think?</i>

19:57.571 --> 19:58.780
<i>Do let me know.</i>

19:58.864 --> 20:00.866
<i>Just say the word</i>
<i>and we'll begin making arrangements</i>

20:00.949 --> 20:03.327
<i>for David's transfer</i>
<i>to another institution.</i>

20:03.410 --> 20:05.746
<i>Please note.</i>
<i>To maintain your utilities contract,</i>

20:05.829 --> 20:08.498
<i>you must pay a penalty of 500 euro-dollars</i>

20:08.582 --> 20:12.377
<i>in addition to any past</i>
<i>due amounts and late fees.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:14.379
<i>If you cannot pay by the deadline,</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:17.966
<i>your services will be terminated</i>
<i>in the following order…</i>

20:18.050 --> 20:20.719
<i>Trauma Team.</i>
<i>Clear a path immediately.</i>

20:20.802 --> 20:22.846
-<i>…medical…</i>
-<i>Ding-ding, Martinez!</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:24.932
<i>Me again. Time's up.</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:27.226
<i>Rent's long past due.</i>

20:27.309 --> 20:29.895
<i>Keep this shit up</i>
<i>and I won't just change your lock,</i>

20:29.978 --> 20:32.981
<i>I'll throw your ass out</i>
<i>on the street. You feel me?</i>

20:49.331 --> 20:52.793
The implant I showed you,
you said you'd take it off me for 10K?

20:53.877 --> 20:56.255
Six now? Said ten yesterday, choom!

20:56.338 --> 20:58.382
Come on. That's just one fucking day.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.634
And we both know that it's worth way more!

21:00.717 --> 21:02.886
Hell yeah, I looked into it, and I--

21:05.472 --> 21:08.558
Oh, yeah? Well, fuck you too! Bitch.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.359
<i>Katsuo here. I heard about your mom.</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:21.113
<i>I could offer my sympathies,</i>
<i>but find it hard to sympathize.</i>

21:21.196 --> 21:23.282
<i>God only knows what she had to endure</i>

21:23.365 --> 21:26.285
<i>to send her delinquent son to an Academy</i>
<i>he doesn't belong at.</i>

21:27.035 --> 21:29.454
<i>Her methods couldn't have been noble</i>

21:29.538 --> 21:33.583
<i>if she died in a car accident. So mundane.</i>

21:33.667 --> 21:34.710
<i>But you know?</i>

21:34.793 --> 21:37.796
<i>Karma. There's a lesson in this, David.</i>

21:39.131 --> 21:41.967
<i>Your mother tried to live</i>
<i>beyond her means and died.</i>

21:42.718 --> 21:44.052
<i>Don't make the same mistake.</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:02.654
Christ. The hell. Who is that?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.657
David, hey.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.785
That the big bad Sandy?

22:08.869 --> 22:12.372
Not a badge or fixer in town
who's not looking for that beauty.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.166
I told you though…

22:14.249 --> 22:18.086
ain't gonna find anyone
that's willing to take it off your hands.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.672
I'm not here to sell.

22:20.756 --> 22:25.177
I want this fused here.
'Bout time I chrome the fuck up.
