WEBVTT

00:18.470 --> 00:20.267
- Okay, let's lose the smile.
- What?

00:21.230 --> 00:22.219
I got good teeth.

00:22.310 --> 00:24.141
Yeah, but we gotta give 'em options.

00:24.230 --> 00:25.390
Darlene, don't I got good teeth?

00:26.190 --> 00:28.101
My mama says
they're my best attribute.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.181
Yeah, well,
your mama's not who we're after here.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.066
At least, I hope not. Give me serious.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.940
- What's so damn funny?
- Keep still, please.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.610
Up the menace.

00:42.790 --> 00:45.748
Scary. I mean, sexy.

00:45.830 --> 00:48.037
- Scary-sexy.
- That's good enough.

00:48.130 --> 00:51.622
Uh... Why don't we move over to the
bed, and lose the trousers, please.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.960
Say what?

00:53.050 --> 00:54.756
The directors are gonna be curious.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.637
She didn't tell me that.
She ain't tell me that!

00:56.720 --> 00:58.711
She said head shots.

00:58.810 --> 01:00.266
Hmm.

01:00.350 --> 01:02.011
I spent all morning
picking out these damn trousers.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.011
They cost me $59.99.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.476
You're doing this
to get into porn, right?

01:05.560 --> 01:06.640
You want to do pornos?

01:06.730 --> 01:08.300
This tells the directors
what they want to know.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.971
Listen, do you want to explain
to the fashion model here

01:11.070 --> 01:12.685
what pornography is?

01:13.070 --> 01:14.310
Huh?

01:14.400 --> 01:17.062
Look, Mr. Brown, we got like,
I don't know, 15 minutes.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.617
You got something to hide,
I say let's just go home.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.536
'Cause whatever she did
or didn't tell you,

01:21.620 --> 01:25.533
the folks eyeing these shots don't
give a fuck about your nice teeth.

01:26.830 --> 01:29.458
Unless they really are
your best attribute.

01:33.470 --> 01:36.428
Fuck it. Fuck this bullshit.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.040
Thank you very much, sir.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.446
Adjust the blanket, please.

02:05.870 --> 02:06.950
I'd hate to see that thing angry.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.666
Best be quick.

03:52.230 --> 03:55.222
Arabescato from Carrara,
Makrana from India.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.764
They used this to build the Taj Mahal.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.488
Shit, they both look the same to me.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.152
Yeah. Kenneth likes the Makrana.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.868
It's also cheaper, but barely.

04:04.950 --> 04:07.783
I like the stateliness of this one.

04:07.870 --> 04:11.328
- So, these are for the back bar?
- Bathrooms.

04:11.410 --> 04:14.322
What? What?

04:14.420 --> 04:15.580
Am I out of control here?

04:15.670 --> 04:17.046
More fucking trouble.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.086
A little bit?

04:19.170 --> 04:20.660
- Another problem, boss.
- What's up?

04:20.760 --> 04:23.376
We got behind that plaster wall,
and there's no wiring. Nothing.

04:23.470 --> 04:25.131
- Nothing?
- Not a circuit,

04:25.220 --> 04:27.176
because they ran the wires
up the goddamn chimney spout.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.093
Two minutes, Stan, I'll be over.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.727
- Remind me why I'm fucking doing this.
- Come on,

04:33.810 --> 04:35.721
it's gonna be great. Eh?

04:35.810 --> 04:39.223
It's gonna be the Taj Mahal
of the Village joints. Huh?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.527
Yeah, if it doesn't break me first.

04:41.610 --> 04:43.146
It's great.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.900
You starting to worry
about your investment?

04:46.990 --> 04:49.447
No! No.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.612
I'm just here to check-see
if there's any trouble, you know,

04:54.710 --> 04:57.838
the other joint,
or here at the work site.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.332
- Gotten anything?
- Mmm-mmm.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.752
Maybe there's nothing to worry about.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.467
Yeah, maybe.

05:04.550 --> 05:08.179
It's been a few weeks
smce that parlor fire.

05:08.260 --> 05:11.593
Maybe them other guys
have backed off. I don't know.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.808
You still got people watching
your places at night?

05:14.890 --> 05:17.222
Yeah. It's costing me, but yeah.

05:19.730 --> 05:21.641
Rudy says another week, or two.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.891
If nothing happens,
then maybe we can stop worrying.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.369
But if Hodas and them greaseballs
behind him are coming,

05:27.450 --> 05:29.020
they're gonna come hard.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.031
And they know
your other place is with Rudy,

05:31.120 --> 05:34.999
and they might not know
that this new spot here is just you.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.958
So, Rudy says just be aware.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.996
Yeah, he's just letting me know
the risk of having

05:40.090 --> 05:41.239
anything out here on my own.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.002
I'm sorry, I just...
I fucking knew it.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.672
Of course, he won't let this go. He's
not gonna let me break away clean.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.048
He isn't saying that.
Do what you want, Paul.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.339
Yeah?

05:52.430 --> 05:54.557
All right. When do you open?

05:56.140 --> 06:00.179
Six weeks? Eight? Three months?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.522
Shit, the way things are going,
possibly never.

06:03.610 --> 06:08.149
All right.
Question, one bathroom, or two?

06:10.780 --> 06:11.940
Two.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.996
I'm just asking.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.958
_ Trying to save you some money.
- Yeah.

06:17.290 --> 06:19.531
It's a tough choice for sure,

06:19.630 --> 06:23.293
but I think,
I'd still pay for the Italian.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.200
Wanna move that six-footer over here?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.546
Probably be worth it in the long run.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.257
Mmm-hmm.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.598
So, all my calls
came to nothing,

06:33.680 --> 06:38.219
and even with the ten grand from LA,
this is gonna need more.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.767
It's gonna need a lot more.

06:40.940 --> 06:44.899
And one thing I know for sure is,
we gotta go Upstate, or Jersey,

06:44.980 --> 06:47.608
or even Westchester,
but someplace, you know,

06:47.700 --> 06:51.272
'cause it's not gonna work
on a half-assed fake-o set.

06:51.370 --> 06:55.579
We need real trees.
I mean, I need a fucking forest.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.786
Harvey, are you listening?

06:59.460 --> 07:00.870
What was I just saying?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.246
You'd want to shoot outside.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.046
We don't have the lights
to shoot outside.

07:06.130 --> 07:07.870
Not at night, anyways.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.426
So, we gotta get some.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.546
And we need to rent a cabin.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.596
And we're gonna need to bring
the actors and the crew up there.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.092
- Are there wood nymphs?
- Excuse me?

07:16.180 --> 07:19.934
Or wood nymphos?

07:20.020 --> 07:21.396
I'd hope.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.568
Oh. Will they also
be wearing lederhosen?

07:26.650 --> 07:28.231
Is that what turns you on?

07:29.400 --> 07:30.856
Sure.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.565
You've done a ton of work here,

07:32.660 --> 07:35.151
and I look at these pictures,
and I can't see it.

07:35.990 --> 07:38.993
I think it's a little quaint
for a fuck film.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.208
Except it's not.
I mean, that's the thing.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.623
I know it plays that way
on the surface. I like that.

07:46.710 --> 07:51.420
But, I mean, this is not
some kiddie shit about, you know,

07:51.510 --> 07:54.001
"Don't go off the beaten path,
or you're a bad girl."

07:54.100 --> 07:57.843
This is about the hunger
and the terror

07:57.930 --> 08:02.469
and the risk we all fucking risk

08:02.560 --> 08:04.050
to connect to each other.

08:04.150 --> 08:08.564
Oh, my. What big ideas you have.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.698
- Fuck you!
- Come on.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.908
No, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. No, no, no.

08:14.990 --> 08:18.733
I'm sorry. Hey, come back...
Please sit down...

08:18.830 --> 08:21.321
- Do we have a script?
- Yes. We do have a script,

08:21.410 --> 08:22.707
but it is mostly in my head.

08:22.790 --> 08:25.452
Well, then, get it on paper,
and we will talk about it more,

08:25.540 --> 08:29.374
and yes, we will see
what we can do with what we have.

08:29.460 --> 08:33.624
I get what you're going for.
I've read my fair share of Bettelheim.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.961
I am familiar with
all the Freudian shit,

08:36.050 --> 08:39.554
sex and death and annihilation
of innocence and matricide,

08:39.640 --> 08:41.301
and infanticide, et cetera.

08:41.390 --> 08:44.268
At the end of the day,
it's gotta be about the fucking.

08:44.730 --> 08:46.721
So, give me three
straight boy-girl scenes,

08:46.810 --> 08:48.562
one with a lesbian munching carpet,

08:48.650 --> 08:51.528
and the big-top orgy at the end.

08:51.610 --> 08:53.066
You got me. I'm sold.

08:53.150 --> 08:54.697
But if the fucking is not good,

08:54.780 --> 08:56.441
then I'm not buying it.

08:58.530 --> 09:00.441
Not by the hair
on my chinny—chin-chin.

09:00.870 --> 09:02.406
That's the wrong fucking fairy tale.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.833
0/7, fuck/27g
Three Little Pigs.
Fuck off.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.546
How'd it go?

09:15.130 --> 09:16.540
It's like pushing string.

09:17.550 --> 09:21.304
But you know, I'm still pushing.

09:21.430 --> 09:25.139
Well, I just wanted to say,
I wrote a play in college...

09:25.650 --> 09:29.393
It didn't get staged or anything,
but I aced the class with it.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.562
My professor said
that I have a really good ear.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.817
On the other hand,
he kind of wanted to fuck me.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.106
You a writer?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.862
I really like
what you're trying to do here.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.152
I just want to be a part of it.

09:45.670 --> 09:48.161
I feel like this is something
I need to do by myself.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.549
Well, I'm here if you need anything.

10:00.010 --> 10:02.808
Hey, what's a Bettelheim?

10:05.310 --> 10:06.595
Yeah.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.356
Hmm.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.936
They call that art?
I could've done that.

10:15.030 --> 10:16.486
I kinda like it.

10:16.570 --> 10:18.481
Looks like Buzz there's
working pretty hard.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.367
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.999
I'm a bartender. I know everybody.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.589
- Hey.
- So, what do you think?

10:31.670 --> 10:33.706
You said photo show,
I thought you meant flowers

10:33.800 --> 10:36.121
and landscapes and seashores.

10:36.220 --> 10:40.088
- Hmm. Like Connecticut, huh?
- It's good.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.592
- Hey, Viv.
- Hey!

10:42.680 --> 10:46.309
Come meet Vincent.
These are Viv's photographs.

10:46.390 --> 10:47.766
- Oh!
- Hello, Vincent.

10:48.390 --> 10:50.472
I think this one's my favorite.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.529
Cookie. She's an actress
in John Waters' films.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.818
- You ever I\sleen those?
- o.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.982
She's from Baltimore.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.867
Viv's got an eye for the marginalized.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.770
Bringing out everyone's humanity.

11:03.870 --> 11:06.828
Hey, all you gotta do is listen.

11:06.910 --> 11:09.708
Sounds like we have the same job,
minus the alcohol.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.543
I'm gonna keep making the rounds,
speaking of alcohol.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.120
Hey, wait.

11:19.590 --> 11:23.219
She's the best.
Can't believe she did all this for me.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.090
Yeah.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.806
Where'd you find this guy?

11:27.890 --> 11:29.517
Looks like my brother

11:29.600 --> 11:33.013
in Bushwick, circa 1961.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.688
Actually, Frankie
still looks like that.

11:36.860 --> 11:40.444
I'm obviously
the more refined brother.

11:43.990 --> 11:48.689
Change! Get your change!
Get your change here.

11:48.790 --> 11:53.875
You want to see the show,
you need to get your quarters here.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.678
Upstairs now,
they’re showing it a// and more.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.590
Things you ain ’t seen before...

12:09.890 --> 12:11.846
I sure feel bad for Frankie.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.225
Yeah.

12:13.310 --> 12:14.766
Think they'll ever
give it back to him?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.101
He'd have to pay back what he owes.

12:17.190 --> 12:19.818
Kiss a lot of familiar
Italian ass, you know?

12:21.900 --> 12:24.232
Rescued ladies want nice fe/ias.

12:24.990 --> 12:27.948
Don’tma/(e ’em wait!
Get in there, boys.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.453
Did you ever think about
how much cum is on those coins?

12:32.580 --> 12:33.569
Say what?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.490
You're jerking off with one hand,

12:35.580 --> 12:38.128
you're pumping quarters
in the machine with the other.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.758
Some of 'em gotta get confused.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.909
- No doubt.
- I mean,

12:42.010 --> 12:42.999
when your head's in that place,

12:43.090 --> 12:45.001
you're not really thinking right
to begin with.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.842
You're spewing on your money,

12:46.930 --> 12:49.421
you're trying to stuff tissue
in the fucking coin slot...

12:49.520 --> 12:50.885
- You know?
- Yeah.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.345
We all just trying
to get to that place

12:52.440 --> 12:53.976
where no other thought matters, right?

12:54.060 --> 12:56.108
- I'm saying.
- Shay!

12:56.440 --> 12:59.523
Shay! Shay! Help!

12:59.610 --> 13:02.067
Shay! Help! Irene!

13:02.150 --> 13:04.402
Shit! Shay? Shay?

13:05.490 --> 13:08.869
_ - Irene!
- Walt your turn, asshole!

13:08.950 --> 13:10.941
- She just keeled over. She was fine.
- Let me in there!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.827
- Irene! Irene! Open up!
- Fuck!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.911
Open up! Irene, what's going on?

13:17.000 --> 13:17.989
What do we do?

13:18.090 --> 13:19.296
What the fuck you looking at, asshole?

13:19.380 --> 13:20.620
Let me in there!

13:20.710 --> 13:21.699
What the fuck did you do to her?

13:21.800 --> 13:22.789
Nothing.

13:23.590 --> 13:24.579
Is she okay?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.669
The fuck?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.250
Get Mario! I need both of you!

13:27.340 --> 13:28.671
I put three quarters
into this machine...

13:28.760 --> 13:30.842
Mario! Hey!

13:30.930 --> 13:32.420
Shay? It's me.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.056
Shay.Shay”.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.435
Have you seen Viv?

13:41.530 --> 13:43.737
Not for a bit, no.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.732
How about Vincent?

13:55.410 --> 13:58.208
Put this on, and drink this up.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.786
Tilt. Mmm-hmm. Swallow it.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.451
We gotta get you to the hospital,
flush you out.

14:03.550 --> 14:04.665
Mario, flag a cab.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.966
Other sleeve now.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.672
Come on. Come on.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.427
- Easy does it.
- Careful. Be careful.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.846
Take your time. Take your time.

14:16.940 --> 14:17.929
- This way.
- Here, cover Shay.

14:18.020 --> 14:21.478
Go, go, go, go. You got it. Come on.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.437
- All right, almost there.
- Here, I got her.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.942
I gotcha, baby. I gotcha.

14:28.910 --> 14:29.979
Third time this year.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.658
Nobody get no higher than Shay,
that's for sure.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.266
Hey! None of that.

15:00.020 --> 15:03.979
Why not? You saying you're not
a character worthy of New York?

15:04.070 --> 15:07.187
Well, I'm not saying that.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.440
Jesus.

15:09.530 --> 15:11.737
Hey, this is early. You should see it
at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.

15:11.820 --> 15:15.404
It's_like the center of the universe.
Anything can happen, and usually does.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.538
I'll bet. But I'm out of film.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.202
You got somebody to take over?
Wanna walk me home?

15:25.460 --> 15:26.620
Hey, Jimmy.

15:26.710 --> 15:29.292
You got the helm
till Big Mike gets here.

15:29.380 --> 15:32.884
- Let's go.
- Pour me a Dewar's first?

15:33.010 --> 15:35.808
- Abby.
- Your show was a hit.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.300
Got a rush at the end.

15:41.270 --> 15:42.976
Too bad you missed it.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.759
- I...
- Don't worry, you're good.

15:45.190 --> 15:46.521
We're all good.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.521
Right, Abby?

15:48.610 --> 15:50.987
Just get me the Dewar's, barman.

15:53.910 --> 15:57.573
Sure thing.
Go on out, I'll meet you out there.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.498
I mean, okay, I was flirting,
but that one came on me fast.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.215
Ungrateful bitch.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.223
Does that mean
you're not gonna jom us?

16:26.270 --> 16:29.899
Don't keep her waiting.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.231
Okay.

16:47.630 --> 16:48.870
Good morning!

16:48.960 --> 16:51.167
Hey! How you doing?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.670
Ow! What the fuck!

16:52.760 --> 16:55.888
- You work here?
- Work here? I own it.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.386
You're supposed to be open by 9:00.

16:57.470 --> 16:59.597
The sign says
"In by 12:00, out by 5:00."

16:59.680 --> 17:02.171
All right, well,
I'm here by 12:00, huh?

17:02.270 --> 17:04.261
- It's 12:40.
- Whatever.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.893
But the sign is saying if we
get you the clothes by 12:00,

17:07.980 --> 17:10.312
then you get them back
to us by 5:00, the same day.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.685
Yeah, so everyone says.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.567
But that's my Sign, I think
it means something different.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.809
Capisce?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.366
Just hold on a minute.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.156
We been holding on
for a long time!

17:19.240 --> 17:20.821
Alma! What the fuck's going on?

17:20.910 --> 17:23.322
You're late, and it's "Almunda."

17:23.410 --> 17:26.823
All right, Almunda,
where's Hui... The other one?

17:26.920 --> 17:30.242
- Sick. She call.
- Sick?

17:30.340 --> 17:32.911
You don't wanna open the door,
let the customers in?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.750
Not me, honey. Alterations.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.586
- Do your damn job!
- Alterations.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.636
- What is going on?
- Excuse me.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.926
This is ridiculous!

17:41.010 --> 17:43.171
- Sir?
- All right, I hear you!

17:43.270 --> 17:45.727
- Hurry it up, mac!
- This is disrespectful!

17:45.810 --> 17:47.801
Never coming here again!
You lost my business!

17:50.320 --> 17:51.935
Finally.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.232
All right.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.409
Open for business.
What can I do for you?

17:58.490 --> 18:00.617
I have borscht on my tzitzit.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.076
Say that again?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.072
Borscht on my tzitzit.
A spill my son made.

18:05.410 --> 18:06.616
On your... On your what?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.166
Tzitzit.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.457
Say that one more time?

18:14.210 --> 18:16.121
Morning, sunshine.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.085
It's afternoon.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.386
What are you guys doing here?

18:21.010 --> 18:23.342
And where the fuck is "here," exactly?

18:23.430 --> 18:27.059
You got an inpatient bed. In Queens.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.346
Your boss here paid.

18:29.310 --> 18:31.562
You paid for 28 days?

18:34.190 --> 18:35.566
Also, I got you breakfast,

18:35.650 --> 18:38.608
even though they stopped
serving it an hour ago.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.742
I gotta let Rodney know where I am.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.109
He knows.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.298
You're gonna be good. I promise.

18:53.380 --> 18:55.871
I'll come by every day,
make sure they're treating you right.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.159
Every day?

18:59.680 --> 19:00.886
What the fuck's wrong with you?

19:07.480 --> 19:11.803
Let me check if they got
some yogurt, or whatever.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.987
What the fuck are you doing here?

19:19.280 --> 19:23.569
Shit, girl, we go way back. All the
way back to the Reggie Love days.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.282
- Old-timers.
- Yeah.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.828
You ask me, when you get out of here,
you're gonna have a man on your hands.

19:36.590 --> 19:39.878
Okay, move around on her,
move around...

19:39.970 --> 19:42.211
Zoom in...

19:42.680 --> 19:44.420
Zooming in...

19:55.860 --> 19:58.021
- I'm sorry, can we cut?
- Yeah, we're cut.

19:58.110 --> 19:59.737
What is with the goddamn breathing?

19:59.820 --> 20:01.401
- It's not me.
- Yeah, I know it's not you.

20:01.490 --> 20:02.980
- Where the hell is John?
- John is gonna be late.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.446
I told you. He's got a dentist thing.

20:04.530 --> 20:06.737
Can we wait for him to come,
so, we can all be professional?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.240
I can't have
the camera guy getting off.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.615
I'm not getting off. I have asthma.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.325
Shit, look,
we can just dub the sound in later.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.786
It's not like he's bumping
into any lines. Am I right?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.279
I'm trying to do my job here, Bernie.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.699
I'm trying
to do my job, too.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.040
Have you ever been
on a movie set before?

20:18.130 --> 20:19.666
- Lots of them!
- You can't be grunting and groaning

20:19.760 --> 20:20.749
in a person's ear.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.582
It is creepy and distracting,
and I can feel your breath on my neck!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.887
Do you want me to pass out and choke?

20:25.970 --> 20:27.005
Go ahead and choke, but be quiet.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.636
May I make a suggestion?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.348
- I'm sorry?
- Let the tourist guy shoot it.

20:32.270 --> 20:34.682
Think about what you're selling here.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.819
Every nut-busting, raincoat-wearin'
chump in the theater

20:37.900 --> 20:41.734
is trying to imagine that it's him
getting head from Lori, right?

20:41.820 --> 20:43.776
So, now, your story has a guy,

20:43.860 --> 20:46.613
in an ugly-ass shirt,
actually getting some of that.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.821
And he's holding the camera.

20:48.910 --> 20:52.402
So, make the camera him. You know?

20:53.710 --> 20:55.746
He's looking down, enjoying the view,

20:56.170 --> 20:59.082
so, we're looking down,
enjoying the view.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.468
Ain't that
what you're selling, aanay?

21:01.550 --> 21:05.179
Plus, no more ducking
the damn plastic palm trees.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.756
Not a bad idea.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.762
- Okay, we're resetting.
- Are we gonna try it?

21:10.850 --> 21:13.728
No, for fuck's sake,
we're not gonna try it!

21:13.810 --> 21:15.801
Our cameraman is shooting the scene.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.061
I am directing the movie.

21:18.150 --> 21:21.859
You keep the breathing to a minimum,
everybody do their goddamn jobs,

21:21.940 --> 21:25.649
and everybody else,
let us do them. How 'bout that?

21:25.740 --> 21:27.526
You think you can manage that, CO?

21:35.330 --> 21:36.490
All right, let's get ready here.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.241
I'm gonna need a few seconds.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.176
Okay, roll sound.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.466
Rolling.

21:55.810 --> 21:58.301
- Wonderful.
- And, cut.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.719
I'll be at the bar.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.481
Can I get a hand with this?

22:04.570 --> 22:06.652
Every week's got
a new set of passengers

22:06.740 --> 22:08.526
with their own bunch of problems,

22:08.620 --> 22:11.612
like, they're lonely
or they're fighting,

22:11.700 --> 22:14.248
or like some guy cheated on his wife.

22:14.330 --> 22:17.367
Then the crew helps them
work things out.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.997
- Love Boat;
huh?
- Don't let him fool you.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.753
He loves it. The cruise director,
especially, with her clipboard.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.831
- You'd be way better than her.
- What are you talking about?

22:26.930 --> 22:28.636
If you were on that show,
you'd be way better!

22:28.720 --> 22:31.006
- I'm not _an actress.
- I'm just saying, you would.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.716
Okay, kiddo.
You got that math test tomorrow.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.266
- How about some studying?
- Yeah.

22:35.350 --> 22:39.093
Do your work, baby.
I'm gonna help Nana with dinner.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.563
Well, that put a lump
in your throat, didn't it?

22:50.910 --> 22:52.400
Yeah.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.827
Yeah, for a minute, you know, it did.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.326
So, you see what I've been saying.
He's older.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.706
He's gonna be older still.

23:02.790 --> 23:06.294
He'll hear about it, or worse, see it.

23:06.380 --> 23:09.884
Yeah, I don't think
we're at that place yet.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.514
You don't think so? Excuse me.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.521
He got it from
your father's sock drawer.

23:32.780 --> 23:34.486
You know this is normal, Ma.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.401
Normal? You're gonna
tell me now what's normal?

23:37.500 --> 23:38.489
- _Ma.
- Eileen,

23:38.580 --> 23:41.322
he is 13 years old. He's exploring.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.285
And sooner or later,
one of these days he is gonna...

23:43.380 --> 23:44.790
Why do I get the feeling

23:44.880 --> 23:47.872
that you want me
to pay the price here?

23:47.960 --> 23:51.009
I am on it.
Now, where'd you find that?

23:51.090 --> 23:54.173
- Under his mattress, where else?
- You should put it back there.

23:54.260 --> 23:55.500
You should.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.512
Unless, you know...

23:58.680 --> 24:00.557
You wanna hang onto it.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.640
Who coiled these XLRs?

24:08.740 --> 24:10.890
Just trying to
find the best angle.

24:11.030 --> 24:14.864
So, seems it turned out okay, then.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.402
You know, Bernie, I'm only trying
to improve the product, all right?

24:20.750 --> 24:24.572
I'm standing around here
all day, ideas do come to mind.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.495
A man can't help it
if he gets inspired.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.411
C.C... It's all right. Okay?

24:29.510 --> 24:33.389
Coulda picked a better moment,
but it's not the worst idea.

24:33.470 --> 24:36.382
Shit, I might even use it sometime.

24:37.260 --> 24:40.229
Yeah? 'Cause I got more
where that came from.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.473
In fact, now's a good time,
I got a brand-new notion.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.141
Uh-oh.

24:47.230 --> 24:50.779
The Life and Times of a Pimp.

24:52.610 --> 24:53.599
Huh.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.196
What's going on? Are we ready to go?

24:57.410 --> 24:58.729
See, I was down at Leon's thinking...

24:58.830 --> 25:01.037
Well, I was actually filling
Rodney and Julito in

25:01.120 --> 25:02.109
on all this Hawaiian nonsense.

25:02.210 --> 25:04.360
I think Bernie has a scene later,
so, we should go.

25:04.460 --> 25:07.623
Our lives are custom-made dramatical.

25:07.710 --> 25:10.122
The day-to-day shit we go through?

25:10.210 --> 25:11.757
The trouble with the johns,
trouble with the hoes?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.889
Plus, you got fucking throughout.

25:14.970 --> 25:17.677
Endless fucking.
Threesomes, eightsomes...

25:18.220 --> 25:20.518
Who gets it more than us pimps, huh?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.056
Hmm?

25:23.600 --> 25:25.147
- You laughing?
- No, no, no, no.

25:25.230 --> 25:26.549
Fuck's he laughing at?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.686
- You saying my tale don't cut it?
- No, what I'm saying is,

25:28.770 --> 25:31.022
you wanna keep making money,
we put the ladies front and center.

25:31.110 --> 25:33.101
- That's just how it works.
- You're gonna find you have a problem

25:33.200 --> 25:34.440
putting women front and center,

25:34.530 --> 25:38.694
sideways, upside-down, or otherwise.
At least this one.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.901
He doesn't mean that.

25:40.990 --> 25:43.743
Baby, we have another scene
we have to shoot tomorrow.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.866
Aloha, motherfucker.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.792
Lori! We gone.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.586
I'll calm him down for tomorrow.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.295
Jesus Christ.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.131
Move it!

26:02.470 --> 26:04.097
Come on!

26:04.560 --> 26:05.800
Go!

26:05.890 --> 26:09.109
Oh, shit! Where's Kitty?
Where's Kitty?

26:10.900 --> 26:12.276
Where the fuck's Kitty?

26:13.110 --> 26:14.850
Where's Kitty?

26:20.370 --> 26:21.906
kitty!

26:21.990 --> 26:23.946
Oh, my God...

26:28.540 --> 26:30.588
Oh, that's Felicia,

26:30.670 --> 26:32.661
and the one in the green's Lulu.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.661
- I could introduce you.
- Maybe later.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.250
Yeah.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.252
Back on the stroll?

26:39.430 --> 26:42.251
- C.C. know you around?
- Yeah, Rodney, he does.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.978
- Who this, your new man?
- Yeah, just keep walking.

26:45.810 --> 26:49.723
Bitch got old! No loss on that one.

26:49.810 --> 26:53.439
Charming. Look,
if you'd rather not be out here...

26:53.530 --> 26:55.395
You reach that doctor friend of yours?

26:55.490 --> 26:57.890
Talked last night.
I meant to tell you.

26:57.990 --> 26:59.605
He loved the idea.
Wants to help with it.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.986
I gotta drive up to Tarrytown,
meet with him tomorrow.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.322
You should come if you can,
tell him more what it'll be.

27:05.410 --> 27:07.571
Holy fuck!

27:07.660 --> 27:09.457
Oh, my God...

27:14.090 --> 27:17.332
I figured you'd be back in the Bronx,
just living the quiet life.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.126
Shit, I figured you were dead.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.927
C.C. made it sound
like you were, anyway.

27:22.050 --> 27:24.052
You ain't with him, right?

27:25.890 --> 27:28.381
I'm still with Larry Brown.
I had a few years there,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.846
where I went to play house
with one of my johns,

27:30.940 --> 27:34.819
and Larry said that I'd be back,
and, shit, he was right.

27:35.650 --> 27:38.232
- Hey. I'm Dave.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.483
This is my friend, Dave.
This is Loretta.

27:41.820 --> 27:44.197
You back on the street,
Dave's someone you oughta know.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.532
He's getting some things organized.

27:46.620 --> 27:47.746
- Oh, yeah?
-Mmmmmm.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.821
What's that, "organized"?

27:49.910 --> 27:54.279
Well, free anti-clap meds to start,
and some other stuff.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.296
Yeah, like what?

28:01.090 --> 28:04.253
- How long you got?
- All fucking night.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.886
- Well, come on.
- Let's go.

28:05.970 --> 28:08.131
Let's get a drink, or something.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.516
Fuck you.

28:15.270 --> 28:16.601
Okay.

28:17.650 --> 28:18.639
All right...

28:20.780 --> 28:23.692
Oh, no. Okay.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.366
"Good..."

28:27.950 --> 28:29.076
"Look..."

28:31.290 --> 28:34.828
"Look how big..."

28:35.040 --> 28:36.280
No, no, no.

28:54.810 --> 28:56.357
Shit.

29:19.170 --> 29:21.206
You let the fire
get to the second floor

29:21.300 --> 29:23.040
before you started clearing the rooms?

29:23.130 --> 29:24.870
Didn't see nothing
till it was too late, Bobby.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.756
What the fuck were you doing?

29:27.510 --> 29:31.344
They got us, Tommy.
Motherfuckers burnt us out here.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.809
- I see that.
- One of my girls didn't get out.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.647
- Which one?
- The kid. Kitty.

29:37.730 --> 29:38.719
I had her at the Alhambra,

29:38.820 --> 29:40.139
and I moved her over here
to the Geisha?

29:40.230 --> 29:41.219
Oh.

29:41.650 --> 29:44.198
I yelled for everyone to get out,
she must've been asleep, or something.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.440
She was asleep?

29:45.530 --> 29:49.318
I can smell your breath from here.
You've had a few. Right, Carlos?

29:50.410 --> 29:52.617
We knew this could be coming.
We were supposed to be on guard.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.656
You wanna speak to that?

29:59.710 --> 30:00.916
Twelve...

30:03.090 --> 30:04.717
Oh, fuck.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.843
Shit. Hey, Alvira,
how you reverse this thing?

30:08.930 --> 30:11.672
Fuck. Got it.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.018
Jesus. Just gimme
my suit already. I'm late!

30:15.100 --> 30:16.727
Got it.

30:16.810 --> 30:19.222
You call this clean?
It may look clean,

30:19.310 --> 30:20.641
I thought it was clean
until I put it on.

30:20.730 --> 30:22.311
Here you go, sir.
Just a little mix-up.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.981
Smell it. I dare you.

30:24.070 --> 30:26.026
I can't even identify it,
but it's nasty.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.737
That's a dress. Not mine.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.902
- What do you mean it's not yours?
- What do I want with a dress?

30:30.990 --> 30:32.730
What does it smell like?

30:32.830 --> 30:34.946
Oh! The fuck got on that thing?

30:36.330 --> 30:37.319
Yeah. You can say that again.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.490
I've been using
this dry cleaner for 15 years,

30:39.580 --> 30:41.491
this is the first time
anything like this has happened.

30:41.590 --> 30:42.989
I don't have time for this!

30:43.090 --> 30:44.409
What happened
to the Irish guy?

30:44.510 --> 30:45.499
I don't know!

30:45.590 --> 30:48.332
But you see him,
tell him he can kiss my fucking ass!

30:48.430 --> 30:50.967
- I will!
- Good!

30:51.640 --> 30:56.259
How about her people, her family,
do they know she's dead?

30:56.350 --> 30:58.261
She never mentioned family.

30:58.350 --> 30:59.977
You got a last name for her?

31:00.060 --> 31:02.312
She showed me an ID
when we hired her on,

31:02.400 --> 31:05.688
said she was 19,
but I don't remember the name.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.908
Cops don't know, either. She went
to the morgue as a Jane Doe.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.025
You can't do any better
than that, Bobby?

31:15.080 --> 31:16.445
The fuck do you mean?

31:16.540 --> 31:19.077
She means you use her,
you make money from her,

31:19.170 --> 31:21.206
and you can't even tell anybody
who she is.

31:21.290 --> 31:25.579
Use her? I use her?
She's paid for the work.

31:25.670 --> 31:28.582
She works in the parlors,
nobody hurts her,

31:28.680 --> 31:30.500
nobody cheats her, she knows this.

31:30.590 --> 31:33.138
Her money's good
at the end of every shift.

31:33.220 --> 31:36.883
- Oh, yeah.
- Fuck the both of youse.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.228
I don't need this.

31:42.270 --> 31:44.067
You think I don't hate
that this shit happened?

31:44.150 --> 31:46.892
She was a nice girl.
This is fucking awful.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.639
- Yeah, it fucking is.
- All right,

31:48.740 --> 31:51.152
why don't we just give it a rest?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.066
Fuck you, too, Vincent Martino.

31:53.160 --> 31:56.288
Any of your other girls close to her?
Did she hang with any of them?

31:57.870 --> 32:00.418
Amber. They're kinda friends.

32:00.540 --> 32:01.780
Okay.

32:03.790 --> 32:05.246
See you later.

32:17.220 --> 32:21.224
- No way to do business.
- The fuck were we supposed to do?

32:21.310 --> 32:24.143
Them guys had Hodas open
five parlors in six months,

32:24.230 --> 32:25.766
all of 'em undercutting ours.

32:26.230 --> 32:29.063
You burn them, they burn us.
Now, there's some dead girl.

32:29.150 --> 32:30.526
And we're in the goddamn newspapers.

32:33.490 --> 32:36.402
- Enough.
- All due respect, Carmine,

32:36.490 --> 32:39.698
I don't see that we let
what happened here go unanswered.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.667
I never said we don't answer.

32:52.090 --> 32:57.881
All right, Bobby, come on.
Time to go home.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.881
I let her live there, ya know?

32:59.970 --> 33:02.598
- The girl?
- Kitty. Yeah.

33:02.690 --> 33:04.305
Let her live where, the parlor?

33:05.520 --> 33:09.024
Back when she started, last winter,
her junkie roommate OD'd,

33:09.110 --> 33:11.271
click of a landlord changed the locks.

33:11.360 --> 33:15.194
So, I said, "Fine, take a room
till you can find a new place."

33:15.280 --> 33:16.861
- I looked out for her.
-Mmmmmm.

33:16.950 --> 33:18.486
I looked out for all of 'em.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.151
But you and your fucking friend
are giving it to me

33:21.250 --> 33:22.786
like I lit the fucking match.

33:22.870 --> 33:26.499
And this one, standing there
like a fucking church statue.

33:26.710 --> 33:30.202
- What's he supposed to do?
- Just let it go. He's drunk.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.757
The girl worked for you, Bobby.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.217
Me, and me alone.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.050
Bobby. Go home.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.425
- You know, funny thing...
- Go home.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.760
Bobby, go home.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.808
Go home! Go back to Brooklyn!

33:46.900 --> 33:49.471
Or wherever else you lay your head
and call home.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.316
Nobody's blaming you.

33:54.650 --> 33:58.859
It's a shit thing that happened,
it ain't anyone's fault!

33:58.950 --> 34:00.941
No one here, anyway.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.176
- Looking for me?
- Yeah.

34:24.270 --> 34:27.307
- Who caught the arson homicide?
- Rappollo.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.608
- Anything kick loose?
- Not yet.

34:30.690 --> 34:33.989
Don't even think he has a solid ID
on the dead girl.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.606
Goldman's mobilizing on it.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.237
He's now mobilizing on every
goddamn case we catch in Midtown?

34:38.320 --> 34:40.060
- Really?
- On the fact that we've got wiseguys

34:40.160 --> 34:43.232
torching up each other's whorehouses,
that needs some attention.

34:43.330 --> 34:47.869
Inspector, respectfully, you keep
trying to marry me to this guy,

34:47.960 --> 34:49.530
but I'm not trying
to get dragged into any...

34:49.630 --> 34:50.995
Whatever you think of the prick,

34:51.090 --> 34:53.547
he and the people running his office
have the mayor's ear,

34:53.630 --> 34:55.871
and they can touch someone
in every city department.

34:55.970 --> 34:58.507
Including ours, apparently.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.546
That Midtown Enforcement Project
is sitting on

35:00.640 --> 35:03.712
half a million dollars to start.
Federal money coming through Albany.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.558
Lemme get that. It's temperamental.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.846
Thanks.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.225
Half a million to start?

35:10.730 --> 35:12.266
Yeah. And look, Detective,

35:12.360 --> 35:14.100
we've got ourselves
a 20-year-old coffee machine.

35:14.190 --> 35:16.647
I'll get it going.
Just takes a second.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.310
I'm holding my breath.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.311
John Ca/ioway, line one.

35:23.030 --> 35:24.156
Thank you, Doctor.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.572
Not at all. Glad to help.

35:26.660 --> 35:28.400
So, again,
just let me check with my office,

35:28.500 --> 35:29.785
and we'll pin down the dates.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.576
The end of the month at the latest.

35:31.670 --> 35:33.956
We'll look on a location
that works and spread the word.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.450
Okay. You may end up with more girls
than you can handle.

35:36.630 --> 35:37.710
Mmm.

35:38.380 --> 35:39.586
Dave told me some of the women

35:39.680 --> 35:42.501
see medical people
who take advantage of the situation.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.965
You shouldn't worry.

35:46.220 --> 35:48.017
Thank you for including me,
Miss Spina.

36:00.610 --> 36:02.737
How far is Nyack?

36:03.450 --> 36:07.113
Yeah, Rick's a cool guy.
So, he's lit some of your films?

36:07.200 --> 36:10.408
Yeah. Yeah, and he says
you're a really great writer.

36:12.210 --> 36:14.531
So,
Little Red Rid/ng Hood?

36:14.630 --> 36:16.996
Yeah. No one's done it as a feature,

36:17.090 --> 36:19.968
and, I mean,

36:20.050 --> 36:22.177
definitely not the way
we want to do it.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.752
So, this would be full-length,
fleshed out...

36:26.260 --> 36:29.388
Well, here's my idea.
I want to update it,

36:29.480 --> 36:31.687
I want to clear out
all the quaint shit,

36:31.770 --> 36:33.761
and I want to make it urban.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.646
I want to move
the whole thing to the city.

36:35.730 --> 36:37.857
New York City.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.522
But it's still a kids' film?

36:41.360 --> 36:42.907
Rick didn't tell you?

36:42.990 --> 36:45.026
Tell me what?

36:45.120 --> 36:48.863
All he said was it's low-budget,
but high enough so you could pay.

36:48.950 --> 36:52.329
It's porn. It's a sex film.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.626
"Fleshed out." Okay, yeah.

36:56.710 --> 37:01.295
I tried to do it myself,
but I'm not a writer.

37:04.930 --> 37:07.467
You wanna take off?
It's fine, I'll get the check.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.676
No. I'm in.

37:10.850 --> 37:14.638
I can see the whole thing.
You know? I think it's genius.

37:14.810 --> 37:16.766
It's sick, but it's genius.

37:17.150 --> 37:19.471
- Yeah? You okay with sick?
- Please. Okay?

37:19.570 --> 37:22.391
The wolf eats the granny
fucking whole...

37:22.490 --> 37:24.560
I used to get a little kiddie boner
whenever I thought of that.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.366
You're kidding.

37:26.450 --> 37:30.489
I am. But I was into it.
Way too into it.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.615
You guys doing porn,

37:31.700 --> 37:33.531
you don't need to use
your real names, right?

37:33.620 --> 37:36.202
Like, in the credits, I mean?

37:36.290 --> 37:39.589
She was older than you guys.
Maybe a year or two ahead?

37:39.670 --> 37:41.456
I don't know if she graduated, or...

37:41.550 --> 37:44.087
She's really pretty, whoever she is.

37:44.180 --> 37:47.343
She oughta get dressed, though.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.921
All right. Thanks, anyway.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.767
Maybe we should give this up.

37:55.850 --> 37:59.183
Worth a try.
We might have the wrong school.

37:59.270 --> 38:01.101
Shit, we might have the wrong town.

38:01.190 --> 38:02.851
With everything, all this,

38:02.940 --> 38:05.773
_ what the fuck am I even _
trying to do here With any of this?

38:09.740 --> 38:12.789
Excuse me.
Either of you know this girl?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.491
Fuck this. Let's just go.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.969
Why are you kicking yourself
just for trying?

38:27.510 --> 38:28.579
Um...

38:28.680 --> 38:29.886
Can I see that again?

38:32.180 --> 38:33.590
It is. It's Stephanie.

38:51.580 --> 38:55.869
- Thanks for coming.
- I was ordered.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.123
Well, I asked McDonagh
for some help from Homicide,

38:59.210 --> 39:00.666
and he said you were my man, so...

39:00.750 --> 39:03.913
You got guys from three
different precincts in here,

39:04.010 --> 39:06.046
and the Public Morals task force.

39:06.130 --> 39:08.428
Captain McGillavery
from Manhattan South

39:08.510 --> 39:10.046
is in command for this,

39:10.140 --> 39:13.132
but they come when called, so...

39:15.180 --> 39:16.169
Pull up a chair.

39:17.310 --> 39:21.098
Hey, Alston.
All aboard the Overtime Express.

39:21.190 --> 39:23.317
The ho wagon rides again.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.740
Who told you where we lived?

39:43.840 --> 39:46.252
We talked to one of your son's
friends at the school.

39:48.510 --> 39:52.594
I thought you'd want to know.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.960
You a whore, too?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.516
What if I was?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.170
Dorothy's an organizer,
actually.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.306
She's trying to help girls
like your daughter.

40:02.610 --> 40:03.759
Little late for it.

40:04.900 --> 40:09.189
Mr. Esposito, she's in the morgue
in New York, unclaimed.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.811
You tell your boss I'm gonna
need him to give up one location.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.866
He can move the girls,
let us kick over an empty joint,

40:15.950 --> 40:17.690
but we're coming next Tuesday.
You got that?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.537
He'll want it to be the place on 35th.
That's our worst earner.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.248
I don't care which. I just need
one spot to give the bosses.

40:23.330 --> 40:26.208
You guys keep setting fire to shit,
so, we're coming.

40:28.010 --> 40:30.217
You know, for a tip like that,

40:30.300 --> 40:33.087
you could at least
pour some top shelf.

40:41.350 --> 40:42.590
What'd he want?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.806
Tell us
there's gonna be raids on Tuesday.

40:44.900 --> 40:46.356
We gotta give up a spot.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.469
Bobby's not here?

40:48.570 --> 40:50.106
Not since the fire
at the Geisha House.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.988
But he told me to have
the nut ready for you.

40:53.070 --> 40:55.868
All right. Come with me.

40:58.450 --> 41:00.748
Frankie's watching us.

41:00.830 --> 41:02.912
Come on now, Vince. We ain't tryin'
to get burnt up in here.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.793
He won't be long. Come on.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.344
- Hey.
- You're working late.

41:17.430 --> 41:20.092
Yeah, I gotta edit
the stuff from yesterday.

41:20.180 --> 41:23.263
Will you pay this
when you get a second?

41:26.980 --> 41:29.107
- How's it looking?
- Good.

41:29.190 --> 41:33.069
The jail guard/lesbian scene's
actually pretty hot.

41:33.150 --> 41:36.313
- Oh, yeah?
- Even with those uniforms.

41:36.410 --> 41:40.073
And the tracking shot you did
past the cell bars,

41:40.160 --> 41:44.278
it's a little slow,
but I think it works great.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.257
I wanted it slow.

41:59.260 --> 42:00.386
Uh...

42:01.180 --> 42:04.343
We're paying actual money
to an outside writer?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.686
Yeah.

42:08.270 --> 42:09.897
I should die of boils.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.479
Yeah!

42:21.580 --> 42:23.400
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

42:32.880 --> 42:34.461
Hey, there...

42:34.550 --> 42:36.506
Hey, get the fuck outta there!

42:36.590 --> 42:38.501
- I don't want your fucking money!
- Simmer down, sweetie!

42:38.590 --> 42:41.058
Get the fuck up outta here
if you know what's good for you!

42:41.140 --> 42:43.597
- What'd I do?
- Done. Cut the fucking light.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.386
I don't need this shit.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.970
Next dancer!

42:49.100 --> 42:52.729
I'm hungry. You're buying.
Tips were shit tonight.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.641
It's all good, clean fun
until the late show,

42:55.740 --> 42:58.447
and then,
the cheapest and the drunkest.

42:58.530 --> 43:00.862
January Cummings!
Come on up, January!

43:01.620 --> 43:03.156
Yeah, from now on,

43:03.240 --> 43:06.038
the part of the nut that's the weekly
from the parlors,

43:06.120 --> 43:09.419
Black Frankie here's
gonna deliver that.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.412
No, Vince. You're responsible.

43:14.380 --> 43:17.713
Not anymore.
I'm stepping away from the parlors.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.756
I want out of that.

43:21.100 --> 43:24.217
Out. What the fuck is "out"?

43:24.680 --> 43:25.920
- Tommy.
- What?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.556
Ain't that one of them motherfuckers
right there

43:27.640 --> 43:28.629
you want me to be looking for?

43:28.730 --> 43:29.936
- Where?
- Sucking on a pizza slice.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.011
- Billy...
- Billy Diamond.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.681
- Who?
- Muscle. Working with the Horse.

43:34.780 --> 43:35.769
And Marty Hodas.

43:35.860 --> 43:38.101
He ain't a made guy, but
he's into their shit just the same.

43:38.530 --> 43:40.486
Here. Hold that a second.

43:46.370 --> 43:47.951
What the fuck is this about?

43:53.590 --> 43:56.878
Thing about all this is that
when I put a torch to your place,

43:56.960 --> 43:59.212
I got the sense to go to a phone,
drop a dime,

43:59.300 --> 44:01.632
call the joint,
tell 'em that they're on fire.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.888
Not you guys. You're assholes.

44:03.970 --> 44:05.756
What the fuck you talking about?

44:06.430 --> 44:07.920
You heard me.

44:08.060 --> 44:09.596
Fuck you.

44:10.480 --> 44:11.640
Fuck me.

44:13.610 --> 44:15.430
- Fuckl
- ohiGO!

44:18.280 --> 44:19.736
The fuck was that about?

44:21.530 --> 44:23.066
Let's go!

44:30.370 --> 44:34.488
Well, that was regrettable.

44:47.220 --> 44:49.017
You see that bald guy?

44:49.100 --> 44:52.888
Fucking prick wanted his bill back
because I wouldn't let him finger me.

44:53.190 --> 44:54.851
Customer ain't always right.

44:57.900 --> 45:02.109
Hey, Tina. You ever think
for one minute of your life

45:02.200 --> 45:04.657
you'd ever find yourself married
to a dry cleaner?

45:04.740 --> 45:07.573
- No.
- Gentlemen, here comes

45:07.660 --> 45:09.491
- the beautiful and fleX/b/e. . .
- Me, neither.

45:09.580 --> 45:12.287
...Jessica Danger to the stage.

45:12.370 --> 45:15.954
Welcome to the stage, Miss Danger.

45:39.860 --> 45:42.647
Stephanie Esposito was 16.

45:44.780 --> 45:46.486
- Wh
- Kitty?

45:48.620 --> 45:53.034
The dead girl.
Ashley found her family upstate.

45:53.410 --> 45:55.116
She was underage.

45:56.630 --> 45:59.167
Might have been 15
when Bobby hired her.

46:05.760 --> 46:09.423
We're going to bury her, Vincent.

46:09.510 --> 46:13.173
Find her a boneyard, buy her a stone.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.259
Okay.

46:14.730 --> 46:17.802
You tell your brother-in-law
this is his responsibility.

46:18.150 --> 46:21.859
Bobby's paying out. This is on him.

46:21.940 --> 46:22.986
I'll do it.

46:23.070 --> 46:27.404
You'll "do it," you'll tell him,
or you'll "do it," you'll pay?

46:27.910 --> 46:30.026
I mean I'll cover it.

46:30.870 --> 46:33.031
Why you?

46:40.340 --> 46:41.910
I asked you a question.

46:42.340 --> 46:43.876
Why you, Vincent?

46:46.090 --> 46:48.638
I want to make sure it gets done.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.347
- I just feel bad.
- That's it?

46:51.010 --> 46:54.343
- Nothing else to say?
- What, is this about the other night?

46:54.430 --> 46:56.591
- Your photographer friend?
- I don't give a shit about Viv.

46:56.690 --> 46:59.727
We both have rules we play by.

47:01.020 --> 47:03.022
- This is Bobby.
- Bobby?

47:03.110 --> 47:05.271
The man was drunk. That's how he gets.

47:11.990 --> 47:15.118
I'm going to sleep.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.407
I've got a funeral to plan.

47:25.340 --> 47:28.423
I saw something happen tonight.

47:30.640 --> 47:31.959
What?

47:37.060 --> 47:39.722
What was it?

47:48.110 --> 47:49.691
You're not gonna tell me?

48:11.760 --> 48:14.752
You're a bad boy,
Prisoner Dickey.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.806
All's I...

48:16.890 --> 48:18.596
Why you gotta be so mean?

48:19.690 --> 48:21.555
All's I want is more food.

48:21.650 --> 48:24.517
Are you gonna say "please"?

48:25.900 --> 48:28.528
You open up these bars, I will.

48:32.570 --> 48:33.980
- It's still you.
- What's still me?

48:34.070 --> 48:35.230
- You have another line.
- Say what?

48:35.330 --> 48:36.445
You have another line.

48:36.540 --> 48:38.280
Okay, let's cut.

48:38.370 --> 48:42.283
- Everyone back to one.
- It's okay. It's okay.

48:42.370 --> 48:44.167
Hey, Larry, what's going on?

48:44.250 --> 48:46.662
If you would quit interrupting me,
I'd get it.

48:47.130 --> 48:48.620
You're throwing me with that shit.

48:48.710 --> 48:51.873
Okay. The line is,

48:51.970 --> 48:55.713
"Open this door, I'll show you
'please' and 'thank you.""

48:58.020 --> 48:59.305
It's five sentences.

48:59.390 --> 49:00.971
Five stupid sentences.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.896
You want me to get this right,

49:08.230 --> 49:10.278
why don't you give me
some shit that makes sense?

49:10.360 --> 49:12.646
Mr. Brown,
you are not the first guy to say

49:12.740 --> 49:14.355
some dumb shit in a porn film.

49:15.570 --> 49:17.151
Now, stop slapping the camera.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.650
...can't say his fucking line.

49:18.740 --> 49:21.038
They're not watching it
for the dialogue.

49:22.830 --> 49:24.786
Candy, respectfully...

49:24.880 --> 49:26.871
Larry, I'd like to roll the camera.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.542
Respectfully, you read that shit?

49:29.630 --> 49:32.167
People supposed to believe
she wanna fuck me behind that shit?

49:32.920 --> 49:35.297
He's right.
I've seen some pretty bad scripts,

49:35.550 --> 49:38.383
but this one is like
a junior high school kid wrote it.

49:38.470 --> 49:41.018
A junior high school kid
who takes the special bus.

49:41.100 --> 49:43.512
- Okay. Okay.
- Just saying.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.649
All right, give me ten minutes,
I'm gonna try and tweak it.

49:46.730 --> 49:48.766
While you're at it,
can you change my name?

49:49.020 --> 49:50.351
Stop!

49:50.440 --> 49:53.523
"Prisoner Dickey." Please.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.020
You're welcome.

49:56.110 --> 50:00.786
- The Life of a P/mp.
- ”Life and Times. ”

50:00.870 --> 50:04.033
It's like he's looking for
a way to piss everybody off.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.873
"The money's good, just shut
the fuck up and get paid, right?"

50:07.420 --> 50:09.581
I just wish that you could rep me.

50:09.670 --> 50:10.659
And he could still get paid,

50:10.750 --> 50:12.911
but you could just do everything
the right way.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.716
That sorta leaves me short.

50:15.470 --> 50:16.835
Yeah.

50:16.930 --> 50:19.842
Or there's this.
You keep C.C. as your manager,

50:19.930 --> 50:22.888
I find you work,
we split the fees on that work,

50:22.970 --> 50:24.801
but only on the gigs I bring you.

50:24.890 --> 50:27.848
- So, you each take half of 15.
- On one condition.

50:27.940 --> 50:29.931
On those jobs, I come with you.

50:30.020 --> 50:32.602
He stays the fuck away
from the film set.

50:32.780 --> 50:36.147
Kiddo, when he had you tricking,
did he need to be in the room?

50:36.240 --> 50:38.447
Different business, same setup.

50:38.530 --> 50:40.191
You want me to tell him?

50:40.280 --> 50:41.577
Mmm-mmm.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.196
You gonna tell him?

50:44.830 --> 50:46.115
Mmm-mmm.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.741
- I think... Wait, where...
- How's it going?

50:50.840 --> 50:51.989
- "I bet you are."
- Still shit.

50:52.090 --> 50:54.081
- There's no saving this storyline.
- "I bet you are."

50:54.170 --> 50:57.253
- "Why are you being so bad?"
- ""Cause I haven't been fed."

50:57.340 --> 50:58.580
- Candy.
- Yep?

50:58.930 --> 51:00.591
Don't make it a thing,

51:00.680 --> 51:03.717
but I don't think Larry can
actually read very well.

51:04.350 --> 51:06.682
I go over his lines
with him the night before,

51:06.770 --> 51:08.681
so, even if y'all make it better,

51:08.770 --> 51:11.352
I don't think he could just change
what he's saying on the fly.

51:11.440 --> 51:15.103
We gonna shoot soon?
I'm losing my juice!

51:17.240 --> 51:18.605
Okay.

51:21.410 --> 51:24.573
Okay, everybody,
let's get ready to shoot.

51:25.290 --> 51:28.032
Everyone back to one,
we are back in.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.327
Hey, Heather. Let's talk.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.911
Least we'll get to the fuckin'
before midnight.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.048
Larry, come here.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.172
What is this scene about?

51:45.310 --> 51:48.347
I mean,
we all know where it's headed, right?

51:48.440 --> 51:52.433
So, you just get there
however the fuck you want.

51:54.270 --> 51:56.647
- Improv?
- Yeah!

51:56.740 --> 51:58.139
Candy, no. No.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.231
Come on. Let's start at the top.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.060
Same places.

52:03.330 --> 52:05.321
Look, hold this.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.531
All you gotta know

52:08.620 --> 52:11.532
is that you fucking hate him...

52:11.630 --> 52:13.200
And he's hot.

52:16.420 --> 52:18.251
And, Larry,

52:21.590 --> 52:23.842
you've been in here a long time.

52:23.930 --> 52:26.672
You are lonely, you are horny.

52:26.770 --> 52:29.091
You know what to fucking do.

52:29.180 --> 52:30.761
Just say whatever you need to say

52:30.850 --> 52:34.354
to get her in this door,
and get her clothes off.

52:39.030 --> 52:40.986
All right, everyone, let's do it.

52:42.820 --> 52:44.651
Can I get a frame line?

52:44.740 --> 52:46.696
Cameras up. And, frame line.

52:47.740 --> 52:49.196
Brace yourself.

52:49.790 --> 52:51.326
What?

52:54.210 --> 52:55.450
Count 'em yourself if you want.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.500
Why don't you give me 15 for it?

52:58.880 --> 53:02.088
Twelve-five is what I have.
And I gave you the keys.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.886
You want it, you keep it, Frankie.

53:10.730 --> 53:12.595
Mr. Frankie. Done.

53:12.690 --> 53:15.511
Hey. Looks good as new.

53:15.610 --> 53:16.725
Thank you.

53:17.980 --> 53:19.561
You have a good life, Alma!

53:19.650 --> 53:21.106
Almunda.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.311
That's what I said.

53:28.410 --> 53:30.742
Three months I've been here.

53:32.870 --> 53:37.489
Hungry, thirsty, alone...

53:37.590 --> 53:38.955
Um...

53:40.010 --> 53:41.750
You've already
had enough to eat, though.

53:42.220 --> 53:44.120
- You bad boy.
_ "Boy"?

53:46.260 --> 53:47.670
ll Boy"?

53:49.220 --> 53:51.268
Why you gotta be so cold?

53:53.640 --> 53:57.144
Just 'cause a man steals a car,

53:57.230 --> 54:00.142
and robs a liquor store,

54:00.230 --> 54:02.061
and pistol-whips two cracker cops

54:02.150 --> 54:05.984
who show up in the parking lot
at the wrong time,

54:06.070 --> 54:08.152
don't mean I don't have any needs.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.329
I'm still a human being you got
locked up in here, ain't I?

54:14.210 --> 54:18.078
How 'bout you show a human some heart?

54:20.960 --> 54:22.450
If it's a heart you have.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.631
Shit. That's the man I know.

54:37.310 --> 54:38.686
So, we good to fuck now?

54:45.450 --> 54:46.986
Some people learn the hard way.

54:52.080 --> 54:55.709
Sector Three,
remove your unit from the sidewalk.

54:55.790 --> 55:00.159
Repeat; Sector Three,
the unit must he moved immediate/y.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.120
That doesn't look friendly.

55:05.590 --> 55:08.502
McDonagh sent you to me,
and you just left.

55:08.590 --> 55:10.638
What should I tell him?

55:10.720 --> 55:12.005
Tell him your bullshit.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.011
What bullshit?

55:15.310 --> 55:17.881
We're gonna raid these parlors
all that we can hit.

55:18.730 --> 55:22.063
Yeah? Is that what you think?

55:27.740 --> 55:29.276
Because I think
you're gonna hit nothing,

55:29.360 --> 55:32.238
just a few empty,
cum-stained shitholes.

55:32.330 --> 55:35.618
- That's what I think.
- Why?

55:35.790 --> 55:37.951
Because half the shitbags
you had in that room,

55:38.040 --> 55:39.576
they had the word out on the street

55:39.670 --> 55:42.992
even before you could drive home
to wherever you mow a lawn.

55:43.090 --> 55:45.297
This is the Deuce.

55:45.380 --> 55:46.620
If it were as easy as you think it is,

55:46.720 --> 55:48.290
it wouldn't be here
in the first place.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.796
I'd let you waste more of my time,
but hey,

55:50.890 --> 55:52.926
I caught a homicide last night,
so, excuse me.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.091
Only books you can read
had to be smut.

55:56.180 --> 55:58.171
The smut kind.

55:59.810 --> 56:01.971
There you go, ma'am.

56:06.030 --> 56:10.023
Maybe we should've gotten someone
to say a few words.

56:10.110 --> 56:11.520
She's Catholic, right? I mean...

56:12.530 --> 56:14.157
No idea.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.502
Don't forget to throw
a stone on there.

56:32.590 --> 56:34.672
I heard you.
