WEBVTT

00:03.634 --> 00:06.551
Welcome, New York City

00:06.554 --> 00:08.999
to the Titanfall

00:09.000 --> 00:11.512
North American finals!

00:12.973 --> 00:14.971
I had no idea you were
into gaming, Chunk,

00:14.973 --> 00:15.971
but I get it.

00:15.973 --> 00:17.937
Nothing inspires a sense of tribalism

00:17.940 --> 00:19.012
like sports.

00:19.013 --> 00:21.301
Competition, Chunk, it's is in our DNA.

00:21.303 --> 00:23.672
Yeah, and the costumes are fun, too.

00:23.672 --> 00:24.672
Tommy.

00:24.672 --> 00:26.972
- Hey, Mr. Palmer, welcome.
- Thanks.

00:26.972 --> 00:29.722
Wait till you see Team
DV8, they're incredible.

00:29.722 --> 00:32.591
And the team captain? He's inhuman.

00:32.593 --> 00:34.932
...the greatest eSports
player in the world

00:34.932 --> 00:37.631
will be leading the unstoppable team

00:37.633 --> 00:39.654
in another Titanfall 2 final.

00:40.432 --> 00:42.591
Can the underdog, Team Quadrocon...

00:42.593 --> 00:44.012
You okay?

00:44.012 --> 00:45.012
I don't think so.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.301
I think I'm...

00:46.302 --> 00:48.131
awesome!

00:50.052 --> 00:51.472
Who's gonna do this?!

00:51.472 --> 00:53.383
- We are!
- When we gonna do it?!

00:53.386 --> 00:55.171
Forever!

01:00.441 --> 01:01.792
Good luck.

01:01.795 --> 01:02.853
Not gonna need it.

01:02.856 --> 01:04.301
Team DV8!

01:04.302 --> 01:07.721
Led by team captain, Jace Rundle!

01:08.936 --> 01:11.146
In just a few minutes,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:11.149 --> 01:14.512
you will see all the drama
up on this large screen...

01:14.513 --> 01:17.472
70 million people are
watching this online.

01:17.472 --> 01:20.341
Tonight's finals is bigger
than the World Series,

01:20.343 --> 01:23.012
so how can so many people
not know about this?

01:23.013 --> 01:25.051
'Cause they got their
heads up their asses, man.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.512
Hey.

01:26.513 --> 01:29.132
Three, two,

01:29.132 --> 01:30.512
one!

01:32.173 --> 01:33.551
Yeah!

01:36.722 --> 01:39.262
Jace Rundle draws first blood.

01:39.263 --> 01:41.932
And that, folks, is the reason that Jace

01:41.932 --> 01:44.012
is the number-one player in the world.

01:44.013 --> 01:45.171
Oh! You see that?

01:46.633 --> 01:49.382
With a $3 million cash
prize and the title at stake,

01:49.383 --> 01:53.091
can Team Quadrocon stop
Jace Rundle and Team DV8?

01:53.093 --> 01:54.293
Highly unlikely.

01:54.295 --> 01:56.222
Jace in front prepares for the shot.

01:56.222 --> 01:57.722
He takes aim.

01:57.722 --> 02:00.052
What?! He misses that shot?!

02:00.052 --> 02:01.341
Come on, man.

02:01.343 --> 02:02.376
Can't believe that.

02:02.379 --> 02:03.391
That is surprising.

02:03.394 --> 02:05.670
Jace held back there,
missing an opportunity.

02:05.673 --> 02:07.591
It appears the mighty are falling.

02:07.593 --> 02:09.526
They'll pull it out. Just-just hold on.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.262
Dewey creates an opening
for Jace to take a shot.

02:11.263 --> 02:12.342
I'm down to 20%.

02:12.342 --> 02:13.472
Take the shot, Jace!

02:13.473 --> 02:14.557
What are you waiting for?

02:14.561 --> 02:16.341
Jace hesitates and Dewey goes down.

02:16.342 --> 02:18.171
Damn it! I'm down.

02:18.173 --> 02:20.633
Things are going really bad for DV8.

02:20.635 --> 02:23.133
Can Jace make this
shot and keep DV8 alive?

02:23.135 --> 02:25.431
Quadrocon readies for escape.

02:25.432 --> 02:28.091
Jace has them in his sights.

02:28.092 --> 02:29.262
He misses!

02:29.263 --> 02:30.882
Oh, my God, he missed.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.262
- He missed!
- Man.

02:32.263 --> 02:33.762
Quadrocon escapes,

02:33.763 --> 02:35.591
and they win!

02:35.593 --> 02:38.263
What a surprise victory!

02:39.358 --> 02:40.722
Oh, my God.

02:40.723 --> 02:42.632
Team DV8 has been beaten.

02:42.633 --> 02:45.222
Quadrocon won $3 million?

02:45.223 --> 02:46.972
It's quite the upset.

02:46.973 --> 02:48.341
This isn't an upset.

02:48.343 --> 02:51.262
This is the Patriots
losing to Oshkosh High.

02:51.263 --> 02:52.841
A-heartbreaking defeat for DV8.

02:52.843 --> 02:54.132
This was an epic choke.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.301
What the hell, man?

02:55.302 --> 02:56.301
I missed, okay?

02:56.302 --> 02:57.882
No, nobody misses a shot like that

02:57.883 --> 02:59.132
unless they're trying to.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.301
Wow. A titan has fallen.

03:01.302 --> 03:02.924
A dynasty overthrown.

03:02.926 --> 03:06.092
This was an epic, and I mean epic, choke

03:06.092 --> 03:07.842
by the greatest gaming team in history.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.093
His mama's gonna be
so disappointed in him.

03:10.096 --> 03:13.222
Hmm.

03:13.223 --> 03:15.301
- Was that for real?
- That was a crazy choke, man.

03:15.302 --> 03:16.841
You think he threw the game?

03:16.842 --> 03:18.264
That was crazy, man.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.341
Jace Rundle's never
missed a shot like that.

03:22.763 --> 03:25.091
There was over $200 million in bets

03:25.092 --> 03:26.132
riding on the championship,

03:26.133 --> 03:29.801
and when Team DV8 lost,
so did millions of fans.

03:29.802 --> 03:32.456
But that was just the first
of many shocking twists.

03:32.459 --> 03:33.752
I've got nothing else to say.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.132
Jace Rundle threw the
game intentionally.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.301
There's no other explanation.

03:37.302 --> 03:38.341
I've suspended him from the team.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.882
No more questions.

03:39.883 --> 03:43.551
That is a huge accusation
from team owner Vin Creuster.

03:43.552 --> 03:46.551
A charge which Jace flatly denies.

03:46.552 --> 03:48.301
Vin's a liar. I didn't throw the game.

03:48.305 --> 03:49.900
And anyone who knows me, knows that.

03:49.901 --> 03:52.432
Three months later, Jace
has found himself unemployed

03:52.432 --> 03:54.171
and a pariah in the league.

03:54.173 --> 03:56.841
He's fighting back with a
$20 million defamation suit

03:56.844 --> 03:59.091
against his former boss, Vin Creuster.

03:59.094 --> 04:01.883
Everyone in the eGamer-verse
will be paying attention

04:01.887 --> 04:02.929
- to how this case unfolds.
- Hmm.

04:02.931 --> 04:05.883
I don't think "eGamer-verse"
is in the dictionary.

04:06.888 --> 04:08.866
Benny uses a dictionary.

04:08.870 --> 04:11.340
We are representing Jace,
who is the plaintiff,

04:11.342 --> 04:12.882
so a change of pace for us.

04:12.883 --> 04:15.461
The good news is, we
present our case first.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.961
The bad news is, we
have the burden of proof

04:17.963 --> 04:19.891
that Vin defamed Jace when he said that

04:19.892 --> 04:21.641
Jace threw the game.

04:21.642 --> 04:24.101
We have to convince ten out of
12 jurors that Vin's comments

04:24.103 --> 04:25.641
cost Jace his career.

04:25.643 --> 04:27.601
Not easy to do.

04:27.603 --> 04:30.435
Well, it's clear that it cost
him his job. Vin fired him.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.514
Well, how do we know that
Jace didn't throw the game?

04:32.516 --> 04:33.802
But Vin hasn't provided

04:33.802 --> 04:35.601
any evidence to back up his accusation.

04:35.603 --> 04:37.721
Is there actually $20
million in the whole sport?

04:37.723 --> 04:39.841
There's billions in it.

04:39.843 --> 04:41.221
I mean, Vin's team alone

04:41.223 --> 04:42.391
is valued at $40 million.

04:42.393 --> 04:43.932
And that's after he fired Jace.

04:43.932 --> 04:45.601
I'm sure you're all over it.

04:45.603 --> 04:47.971
No, not this game, it's too addictive.

04:47.973 --> 04:49.012
What's the story behind that?

04:49.012 --> 04:50.471
It's none of your business.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.221
Well, I'm way into the 'Fall.

04:52.223 --> 04:53.552
Into what?

04:53.552 --> 04:55.601
Titanfall, that's the name of the game.

04:55.603 --> 04:57.891
And it's electrifying.

04:57.893 --> 05:00.302
I think it's the dawn of
a whole new era in sports.

05:00.302 --> 05:02.891
Right now the problem with this sport is

05:02.892 --> 05:05.841
team owners like Vin,
they can accuse players

05:05.843 --> 05:08.682
like Jace of anything, and
the players have no recourse.

05:08.682 --> 05:11.973
So, let's put together
some mock juries...

05:11.975 --> 05:13.327
See who agrees.

05:13.329 --> 05:14.682
Mm.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.052
ESports.

05:16.052 --> 05:18.182
The biggest sport you never heard of.

05:18.182 --> 05:19.432
Tops players

05:19.432 --> 05:22.341
make millions of dollars a year.

05:22.343 --> 05:23.802
From playing video games.

05:23.802 --> 05:25.298
Excuse me, Dr. Bull?

05:25.302 --> 05:26.971
When the stakes are that high,

05:26.973 --> 05:29.721
calling someone a cheater can
have devastating consequences.

05:29.723 --> 05:30.932
You must be Abigail Walsh,

05:30.932 --> 05:32.682
of Schuster, Denton & Hart.

05:32.682 --> 05:34.012
This is my client, Jace Rundle,

05:34.012 --> 05:36.012
number-one gamer in the world.

05:36.012 --> 05:37.052
Good to meet you, Doc.

05:37.052 --> 05:38.471
This is, uh, Marissa Morgan.

05:38.473 --> 05:39.891
Number-one algorithmer in the world.

05:39.893 --> 05:41.471
She says you're the best.

05:41.473 --> 05:42.762
According to Don Schuster.

05:42.762 --> 05:44.744
Well, Don and I handled
the NHL renegotiations.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.721
Helped about a dozen players
out of some sticky situations

05:47.723 --> 05:48.702
over the years.

05:48.704 --> 05:50.082
But no eSports.

05:50.086 --> 05:51.716
Uh, whatever the context,

05:51.718 --> 05:55.101
I find every trial comes
down to the same dynamic:

05:55.103 --> 05:56.101
selling the jury.

05:56.103 --> 05:57.432
That's funny.

05:57.432 --> 06:01.302
I find every trial has
a different dynamic.

06:02.392 --> 06:04.012
Jace,

06:04.012 --> 06:07.221
would you mind excusing
us for just a moment?

06:07.223 --> 06:09.391
Just when it's getting good.

06:09.393 --> 06:11.262
Jace, why don't I show you around?

06:11.262 --> 06:12.182
Excuse us.

06:12.184 --> 06:13.230
Thank you, Marissa.

06:15.473 --> 06:18.891
When, um, Don suggested,

06:18.893 --> 06:21.341
actually, insisted I hire you,

06:21.343 --> 06:23.141
I protested.

06:23.143 --> 06:25.512
Not because I don't value your services,

06:25.512 --> 06:28.971
but because I don't believe I need them.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.802
Well, they couldn't hurt.

06:30.802 --> 06:33.971
Handling the first big eSports case?

06:33.973 --> 06:36.432
A win for Jace would mean
a lot of new gamer clients.

06:36.432 --> 06:38.302
A windfall that Schuster
will attribute to you.

06:38.302 --> 06:41.182
Are you afraid you won't get credit?

06:41.182 --> 06:43.101
Let's establish some rules.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.221
Oh, okay.

06:44.223 --> 06:47.101
If we disagree, I get the final call.

06:47.103 --> 06:49.891
And if you try to poison
my client against me,

06:49.893 --> 06:51.432
then I will do everything in my power

06:51.432 --> 06:53.101
to see that you get fired.

06:53.103 --> 06:55.052
I accept your rules,

06:55.052 --> 06:56.302
if you'll accept mine.

06:56.302 --> 06:57.641
I'll let you take the credit,

06:57.643 --> 06:59.391
but if you don't take my advice,

06:59.393 --> 07:01.182
you also have to take the blame.

07:01.182 --> 07:02.762
I'm a big girl.

07:02.762 --> 07:05.182
I'm okay with calling you
"boss" in front of Jace,

07:05.182 --> 07:06.552
if it helps.

07:06.552 --> 07:09.052
Welcome to my team.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.343
And you can call me Abigail.

07:12.393 --> 07:13.932
Sure thing, boss.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.302
Pebble Beach?

07:17.302 --> 07:18.641
St. Andrews?

07:18.643 --> 07:21.012
Ooh, how about something hard?

07:21.012 --> 07:23.012
Bethpage Black, from the tips.

07:23.012 --> 07:24.762
Okay.

07:24.762 --> 07:28.182
She, uh, read you the riot act?

07:28.182 --> 07:30.141
I get the feeling she
didn't play a lot of

07:30.143 --> 07:32.641
team sports growing
up, but she likes games.

07:32.643 --> 07:35.182
Which brings us to the
question of the day...

07:38.911 --> 07:40.973
- Did I throw the game?
- Hmm.

07:40.975 --> 07:43.971
Very unorthodox swing, but nice drive.

07:43.973 --> 07:47.408
A slight fade might've helped
you with the virtual wind.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.112
If you didn't throw the game...

07:52.143 --> 07:53.052
...how'd you lose?

07:53.052 --> 07:54.971
The same way Steph Curry

07:54.973 --> 07:56.182
or Cam Newton do it,

07:56.182 --> 07:57.932
by having the worst day of my life.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.012
Playing a draw sets
up the approach better.

08:02.012 --> 08:04.262
Why didn't you join another team?

08:04.262 --> 08:05.471
Vin blacklisted me.

08:05.473 --> 08:07.302
Nothing official or anything,

08:07.302 --> 08:09.762
but I guess the other
owners bought into his lie.

08:09.762 --> 08:11.182
Overnight,

08:11.182 --> 08:13.302
I went from number one to nothing.

08:17.552 --> 08:19.221
This game,

08:19.223 --> 08:21.221
this team,

08:21.223 --> 08:22.393
it was my life.

08:24.182 --> 08:28.432
When I was four, my mom bought
me a used game console on eBay.

08:28.432 --> 08:30.302
I never stopped playing.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.641
It was an escape?

08:31.643 --> 08:32.971
From the crappy one-bedroom

08:32.972 --> 08:35.182
row house with six people inside?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.182
Yeah.

08:40.143 --> 08:42.142
Nice shot.

08:42.143 --> 08:44.302
I'm still gonna win.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:54.222 --> 08:55.341
You all right?

08:55.342 --> 08:57.222
I'm fine.

09:00.323 --> 09:01.573
Yipped it.

09:07.552 --> 09:09.013
Jace?

09:09.014 --> 09:10.471
Mm-hmm?

09:10.472 --> 09:13.302
For some people,
winning is an addiction,

09:13.302 --> 09:15.147
it's physiological, it's in their blood.

09:15.149 --> 09:16.162
And for other people?

09:16.164 --> 09:17.471
It's psychological.

09:17.472 --> 09:20.101
It's something they... need.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.971
But you losing intentionally?

09:21.972 --> 09:24.182
I don't think you're capable of it.

09:24.182 --> 09:26.721
All right. Now that you
know I didn't throw the game,

09:26.722 --> 09:28.642
double or nothing.

09:28.643 --> 09:30.013
Because you know what?

09:30.841 --> 09:33.063
Seems like you have to
win just as much as I do.

09:49.475 --> 09:51.705
This is Jace's gameplay from that night.

09:51.707 --> 09:53.537
I can't tell whether he's trying or not.

09:53.538 --> 09:56.167
How do we prove to the jury
that he didn't throw the game?

09:56.168 --> 09:58.667
We'll get experts to dissect
the moves for the jury.

09:58.668 --> 10:01.496
Testify that Jace's play
was inconsistent with someone

10:01.498 --> 10:03.417
who was intentionally losing.

10:03.418 --> 10:04.866
No, because then they'll get experts

10:04.868 --> 10:06.706
to testify that he was trying to lose.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.787
Can't win a case on dueling experts.

10:08.788 --> 10:10.206
We're asking the wrong questions.

10:10.207 --> 10:12.746
It's not, "Did he intentionally lose?"

10:12.748 --> 10:14.576
It's, "Could he intentionally lose?"

10:14.577 --> 10:16.917
We put his character on trial.

10:16.918 --> 10:18.746
The other side will.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.917
They'll say he's a cheater.

10:20.918 --> 10:23.866
So, our strategy is to
paint Jace as a competitor

10:23.868 --> 10:27.206
who wants to win so badly,
he could never throw a game.

10:27.207 --> 10:28.417
Hmm, talk to his teammates.

10:28.418 --> 10:29.996
Get them to testify to that.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.417
We'll need a better mock jury pool.

10:31.418 --> 10:33.787
They still haven't landed
on the right configuration.

10:33.788 --> 10:36.326
Let's cast a wider net:
gamers, sports fans,

10:36.327 --> 10:37.706
cheaters and people who hate cheaters.

10:37.707 --> 10:39.417
On it.

10:39.418 --> 10:41.206
Let's see where Danny is with the money.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.826
$200 million was bet on this game.

10:43.827 --> 10:48.667
At 25 to one odds,
somebody won big time.

10:48.668 --> 10:50.866
Making sure Jace is clean?

10:50.868 --> 10:53.456
And let's find who's dirty.

10:53.457 --> 10:55.126
So, you're the expert.

10:55.128 --> 10:57.456
What's their jury move going to be?

10:57.457 --> 11:00.496
Vin's the team owner, the man in charge.

11:00.498 --> 11:01.667
Oh, so they'll stack the jury

11:01.668 --> 11:03.537
with people who respect Vin as the boss:

11:03.538 --> 11:05.056
authority figures.

11:05.058 --> 11:06.517
Who do you want to see on the jury?

11:06.519 --> 11:09.278
Well, initially I was thinking
sports players, but now...

11:09.282 --> 11:11.037
people who resent authority.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.667
Our mock trials showed only one group

11:12.668 --> 11:16.076
consistently sided with Jace:
people with horrible bosses.

11:16.077 --> 11:18.206
They think Vin shafted him,

11:18.207 --> 11:21.996
and they want to see him
pay for the daily indignities

11:21.998 --> 11:23.866
they suffer under their
own horrible bosses.

11:23.868 --> 11:25.866
Ah, I can work with that,

11:25.868 --> 11:27.076
but there's one small snag:

11:27.077 --> 11:28.866
the judge's docket is backed up,

11:28.868 --> 11:31.000
so he's going with a blind strike
voir dire to speed things up.

11:31.003 --> 11:32.576
I love the blind strike.

11:32.577 --> 11:34.243
What the hell's a blind strike?

11:34.245 --> 11:35.866
Well, normally, attorneys take turns

11:35.868 --> 11:37.126
striking jurors in open court, but...

11:37.128 --> 11:38.366
But with blind strikes,

11:38.368 --> 11:40.368
each side makes their lists in private.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.039
Then we give them to the
judge at the same time,

11:42.042 --> 11:44.957
so we have to guess who
the other side will strike.

11:44.961 --> 11:47.062
So, you could waste a
strike on the same juror.

11:47.066 --> 11:48.765
The dreaded double strike, which...

11:48.769 --> 11:50.407
Which we do everything we can to avoid.

11:50.409 --> 11:51.537
How do you do that?

11:51.538 --> 11:53.037
By getting the other side to...

11:53.038 --> 11:56.037
Oh, I'm sorry, would you like to finish?

11:56.038 --> 11:58.498
Only if you need me to.

11:59.538 --> 12:02.496
By getting the other side
to strike jurors for us.

12:04.248 --> 12:05.498
Ms. Walsh, your jury.

12:07.365 --> 12:09.496
She can pull off a purple power suit.

12:10.918 --> 12:13.297
All right, Marissa, I'm
plugged in and ready.

12:13.298 --> 12:15.586
First up. Walter: 42, architect,

12:15.587 --> 12:17.706
buttoned-up, dots his
"I"s crosses his "T"s.

12:17.707 --> 12:19.947
His boss took credit
for one of his designs,

12:19.950 --> 12:21.524
and won an industry award.

12:21.528 --> 12:23.167
He almost jumped out of his chair

12:23.168 --> 12:24.917
when the judge banged the gavel.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.336
Makes me think he might have
a problem with authority.

12:27.337 --> 12:29.167
Getting intel on a comm?

12:29.168 --> 12:30.297
Cool.

12:30.298 --> 12:31.996
We want Walter, so that means

12:31.998 --> 12:33.246
the defense will want to strike him.

12:33.248 --> 12:36.706
Mm, which is why we
expose his stickler side,

12:36.707 --> 12:38.667
make him look like a
guy who hates breaking

12:38.668 --> 12:40.706
even the smallest of rules,

12:40.707 --> 12:43.246
and that way the defense
will want him, too,

12:43.248 --> 12:45.941
'cause they'll think he has
respect for the boss's rules.

12:45.943 --> 12:47.773
Do typos and grammatical
mistakes bother you?

12:47.775 --> 12:49.205
They're annoying.

12:49.207 --> 12:51.316
- What about punctuation errors?
- Not my favorite.

12:51.318 --> 12:53.086
Ending sentences with prepositions?

12:53.087 --> 12:54.586
Please.

12:54.587 --> 12:56.798
Let's just say I don't like them, okay?

13:00.168 --> 13:02.417
Looks like they took the bait.

13:02.418 --> 13:03.960
You're devious, I love it.

13:08.668 --> 13:10.246
Five minutes left, guys.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.376
Okay. One strike left.

13:12.378 --> 13:13.706
Arlo or Connie.

13:13.707 --> 13:17.417
Arlo, 43. VP of a cosmetics company.

13:17.418 --> 13:20.246
His department has the highest
turnover rate of the company,

13:20.248 --> 13:21.956
and possibly the world.

13:21.957 --> 13:23.990
Oh, epitome of the horrible boss.

13:23.994 --> 13:26.206
He'll love Vin. Strike.

13:27.668 --> 13:31.456
I agree we don't want
him, but you got him

13:31.457 --> 13:33.297
to admit that he likes playing Frisbee,

13:33.298 --> 13:35.626
a sport he likened to Titanfall.

13:35.628 --> 13:37.376
So, they'll use a strike on him.

13:37.378 --> 13:39.037
No need for us to waste one on Arlo.

13:39.038 --> 13:41.126
Unless they don't, then
we're stuck with him.

13:41.128 --> 13:42.274
They'll strike him.

13:42.277 --> 13:44.246
Vin's attorney isn't a risk-taker.

13:44.248 --> 13:46.168
He won't mind giving up
a strike to get his way.

13:47.207 --> 13:49.246
I won't take the risk, either.

13:49.248 --> 13:50.456
We strike Arlo.

13:50.457 --> 13:51.667
We need to strike Connie.

13:51.668 --> 13:53.876
Connie's 65, secretary by day,

13:53.878 --> 13:55.996
animal activist by night.

13:55.998 --> 13:59.086
Takes in rescues and attends
animal rights rallies.

13:59.087 --> 14:01.049
She sees herself as a saver of lives.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.037
She'll have little patience
for those who take them,

14:03.038 --> 14:04.706
virtual or otherwise.

14:04.707 --> 14:07.298
We strike Connie, they strike Arlo.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.537
One juror can kill

14:10.538 --> 14:12.126
our entire case.

14:12.128 --> 14:13.297
Connie's a question mark.

14:13.298 --> 14:14.376
Arlo is poison.

14:14.378 --> 14:15.626
I hate question marks.

14:15.628 --> 14:16.957
I agree with Bull.

14:19.602 --> 14:21.472
Do I have to leave again?

14:21.475 --> 14:23.417
I just want to win.

14:23.418 --> 14:24.417
Me, too.

14:24.418 --> 14:26.167
Okay, guys, clock's ticking.

14:26.168 --> 14:28.876
Well, that makes three of us.

14:28.878 --> 14:31.537
If Bull is wrong, which
believe it or not, is possible,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.109
then Arlo will infect the entire jury.

14:33.111 --> 14:34.456
I need to go with my gut here.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.376
We strike Arlo

14:35.378 --> 14:37.496
and we take our chances with Connie.

14:37.498 --> 14:39.337
Do we need to revisit the ground rules?

14:40.378 --> 14:41.837
You're the boss.

14:44.312 --> 14:46.917
Okay, juror 22, thank
you for your service.

14:46.918 --> 14:49.475
Arlo, you're excused.

14:49.479 --> 14:52.206
Number 23, could you
please take his seat.

14:52.207 --> 14:53.746
They struck Arlo.

14:53.748 --> 14:55.836
We both did, the dreaded double strike,

14:55.837 --> 14:57.337
and now we're stuck with Connie.

14:59.207 --> 15:01.378
So much for your gut.

15:03.378 --> 15:04.878
Abigail was right.

15:05.918 --> 15:08.871
We had no shot with Arlo on the jury...

15:08.875 --> 15:10.496
but if she'd trusted me,

15:10.498 --> 15:12.376
we would've avoided Connie, too.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.126
Trust has to be earned, I guess.

15:14.128 --> 15:15.956
Connie's looking at me

15:15.957 --> 15:17.970
like I'm stuck on the
bottom of her shoe.

15:17.972 --> 15:19.336
Well, then...

15:19.337 --> 15:22.336
it's a good thing we
love challenges, isn't it?

15:26.457 --> 15:27.761
Oh.

15:27.764 --> 15:29.876
Hey, I like the scruff.

15:29.878 --> 15:31.667
Things have changed since you graduated

15:31.668 --> 15:33.086
from being a field agent.

15:33.087 --> 15:34.537
I guess you can do what you want,

15:34.538 --> 15:35.667
now that you're the big SAC.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.456
I prefer...

15:37.457 --> 15:39.376
Special Agent in Charge.

15:39.378 --> 15:42.496
Made it easier to get
you what you wanted.

15:42.498 --> 15:44.917
You'd be amazed how much
gambling is in sports.

15:44.918 --> 15:47.667
The game had millions bet on it.

15:47.668 --> 15:50.586
Most of the betting on
the game was underground.

15:50.587 --> 15:53.246
Bahamas-based supply
packaging companies...

15:53.248 --> 15:55.626
fronts for offshore gambling.

15:55.628 --> 15:56.706
That's a lot of bets,

15:56.707 --> 15:59.297
but I'm not seeing
anything over 20 grand.

15:59.298 --> 16:00.417
Follow the credit cards.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.269
There's some repeat offenders there.

16:02.273 --> 16:03.981
Must have been intense
playing with Jace.

16:03.985 --> 16:05.403
Understatement of the year.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.836
The guy practiced 16 hours a day.

16:07.837 --> 16:09.496
So did we just to keep up with him.

16:09.498 --> 16:11.956
If he made the tiniest
slip, he'd beat himself up,

16:11.957 --> 16:13.878
like it was all on his shoulders.

16:15.628 --> 16:16.876
Any chance he threw it?

16:16.878 --> 16:18.086
I've been asking myself that,

16:18.087 --> 16:20.006
but if you saw him right after the game,

16:20.008 --> 16:22.126
he was in shock.

16:22.128 --> 16:23.466
You'll testify to that?

16:23.467 --> 16:25.506
- Yeah, if it'd do any good.
- Why wouldn't it?

16:25.508 --> 16:26.876
Our team was pretty special.

16:26.878 --> 16:29.206
We won the championship
four times in a row,

16:29.207 --> 16:31.336
but Vin broke us up just to punish Jace.

16:31.337 --> 16:33.297
Even if Jace wins the case,

16:33.298 --> 16:35.508
we'll never get the team back.

16:36.707 --> 16:38.876
Ask Yuna. She'll tell
you the same thing.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.126
It's not like Dewey's

16:40.128 --> 16:42.297
a bad team leader, he's trying,

16:42.298 --> 16:44.336
and clearly, he likes
being in charge, but...

16:44.337 --> 16:45.506
He's no Jace.

16:45.508 --> 16:46.506
Dewey's young.

16:46.508 --> 16:48.297
Jace is old, like, 25.

16:49.587 --> 16:51.206
And Jace knew how to
make us want to win,

16:51.207 --> 16:53.336
you know, play as a team.

16:53.337 --> 16:54.466
And we tried harder

16:54.467 --> 16:55.966
because we didn't want to let him down.

16:55.967 --> 16:57.167
You don't think he lost intentionally.

16:57.168 --> 16:59.506
No, no. No, he wanted it too badly.

16:59.508 --> 17:03.548
He was just a bit off
that day, that's all.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.506
You miss him.

17:06.508 --> 17:09.256
We all lived together in a gaming house.

17:09.258 --> 17:12.415
Worked, played, practiced, 24/7.

17:12.416 --> 17:13.757
But nothing ever happened between us.

17:13.758 --> 17:15.207
Jace was very clear,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.415
he didn't want anything to
interfere with the team dynamic.

17:17.416 --> 17:18.797
What about now?

17:18.798 --> 17:22.376
The second he was gone,
Vin excommunicated him.

17:22.377 --> 17:25.166
No texts, calls, nothing.

17:26.208 --> 17:30.336
So, yeah, I... I miss him.

17:30.337 --> 17:31.416
Sorry, I won't get this emotional

17:31.417 --> 17:32.417
- No.
- on the stand.

17:32.421 --> 17:34.207
I want you to be exactly like this.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.507
Don't change a thing.

17:35.508 --> 17:38.298
You're gonna be a perfect
character witness for Jace.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.376
I'm an avid gardener.

17:41.377 --> 17:42.836
I'm an avid gardener.

17:42.837 --> 17:44.297
I rescue distressed animals.

17:44.298 --> 17:46.416
I rescue distressed animals.

17:46.417 --> 17:47.494
I listen to heavy metal.

17:47.498 --> 17:48.707
I listen to heavy metal.

17:48.708 --> 17:51.257
The mirror jurors are evenly
split after opening statements.

17:51.258 --> 17:53.297
Connie is leading the dark side.

17:53.298 --> 17:55.336
Well, let's bring her to the light.

17:55.337 --> 17:57.047
Ever heard of the IKEA effect?

17:57.048 --> 17:58.376
I imagine I'm going to.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.547
It's a cognitive bias

17:59.548 --> 18:01.336
where consumers place a higher value

18:01.337 --> 18:03.296
on a thing they have put work into.

18:03.298 --> 18:05.086
Like building furniture;
it makes them like it more

18:05.087 --> 18:07.007
than if they bought it assembled.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.166
We get Connie to invest in Jace

18:09.167 --> 18:11.547
by enjoying the video game Titanfall,

18:11.548 --> 18:14.376
she'll be converted by
the end of the trial.

18:14.377 --> 18:16.276
Hey, so, I called in a favor
from a friend at the Bureau.

18:16.278 --> 18:20.335
Thousands of bets were made on
the big game, but mostly small.

18:20.337 --> 18:22.207
When I started cross-reffing
some of the larger ones,

18:22.208 --> 18:25.126
I found several were
from corporate sells,

18:25.127 --> 18:27.836
that, um, all came from
the same offshore bank.

18:27.837 --> 18:30.007
Someone wanted to bury
a big bet. How much?

18:30.008 --> 18:31.666
500 grand, but all against Jace.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.626
The odds were 25 to
one, he was unbeatable.

18:34.627 --> 18:37.007
No one would risk that
unless it was a sure thing.

18:37.008 --> 18:41.167
That gives Jace a very
good reason to lose.

18:57.973 --> 19:00.562
Your lawyer's here.

19:00.563 --> 19:01.975
Actually, I'm not a lawyer.

19:03.615 --> 19:04.772
So I'm gonna go.

19:04.773 --> 19:06.931
Go where?

19:06.932 --> 19:09.273
Anywhere without lawyers.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.732
She's a keeper.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.471
This isn't what she signed up for.

19:15.473 --> 19:17.602
I can imagine.

19:18.642 --> 19:20.471
I know about the bet.

19:20.473 --> 19:22.273
What bet?

19:23.602 --> 19:26.431
One hour before the match that you lost,

19:26.432 --> 19:29.062
someone put $500,000
down on the other team.

19:29.063 --> 19:31.181
At 25 to one, that's...

19:31.182 --> 19:32.312
$12.5 million.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.642
Who would make that bet?

19:35.182 --> 19:37.273
Should've been 50 to one.

19:39.642 --> 19:42.851
You think I placed the
bet and tanked the match.

19:42.852 --> 19:44.641
I did when I sat down.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.522
Something change your mind?

19:46.523 --> 19:48.062
It's called the Pinocchio effect.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.681
When a person lies,

19:49.682 --> 19:51.732
there's a slight increase in temperature

19:51.733 --> 19:53.681
to the nose and orbital muscle,

19:53.682 --> 19:55.812
causes a little bit of redness.

19:55.813 --> 19:57.022
No red nose,

19:57.023 --> 19:58.601
plus you scratched your neck.

19:58.602 --> 19:59.641
Which means?

19:59.642 --> 20:01.233
You're wondering the same thing.

20:03.509 --> 20:06.562
So, who's $12.5 million richer?

20:06.563 --> 20:08.572
That's the question.
We're gonna keep digging.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.732
You know, Vin says the only
way you could've lost this match

20:10.733 --> 20:12.732
is if you'd thrown it.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.435
He's never played it,
so he doesn't get it,

20:15.438 --> 20:18.471
but anyone who actually gives
it a chance, they love it.

20:18.473 --> 20:20.562
And if you really love it,
why the hell would you ever

20:20.563 --> 20:23.198
throw a game?

20:23.200 --> 20:26.141
Then let's get the jury to love it.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.641
So, what are we looking at here?

20:28.642 --> 20:32.312
An introduction to the
masterpiece known as Titanfall,

20:32.313 --> 20:35.812
a sci-fi fantasy
first-person shooter game.

20:35.813 --> 20:37.471
Two teams of four fight each other

20:37.473 --> 20:39.367
until one team has
destroyed the other's base.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.641
To be successful, you
need teamwork, strategy.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.641
Like most companies?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.522
Yeah, but we slay enemy forces,

20:46.523 --> 20:49.022
save civilians. It's... fantasy.

20:49.023 --> 20:50.681
But still, it's-it's just a game.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.641
Why are so many people attracted to it?

20:52.642 --> 20:55.851
You get to be a heroic
warrior who saves mankind.

20:55.852 --> 20:57.601
For a lot of people,

20:57.602 --> 20:59.273
it beats the hell out of real life.

21:01.432 --> 21:03.062
So, could we

21:03.063 --> 21:04.312
play the game right now?

21:04.313 --> 21:05.522
Yeah, sure.

21:05.523 --> 21:07.351
Just touch your screen to start.

21:07.352 --> 21:10.601
Customize your character to
reflect your own personality.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.562
Just let your imagination run wild.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.232
That's what made me fall
in love with the game.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.272
Now, though, it's all
about the competition.

21:16.273 --> 21:17.772
Okay, I chose my avatar.

21:17.773 --> 21:19.431
Everyone choose theirs?

21:19.432 --> 21:20.891
Not yet, hold on.

21:20.892 --> 21:21.891
Hold on.

21:21.892 --> 21:23.141
Oh, all right, take your time.

21:23.142 --> 21:24.351
We'll wait.

21:27.852 --> 21:30.562
I have to say, you were good in there.

21:30.563 --> 21:32.601
I thought it went well.

21:32.602 --> 21:34.351
I get the feeling you
think I'm the enemy.

21:34.352 --> 21:36.062
We're allies, you know.

21:36.063 --> 21:38.062
Sounds like you want
me to sign a treaty.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.851
Well, I happen to know

21:39.852 --> 21:42.681
this great restaurant called Versailles.

21:46.733 --> 21:47.892
You're cute.

21:50.313 --> 21:51.813
But I don't date employees.

21:59.892 --> 22:01.063
Oh, boy.

22:04.432 --> 22:06.312
Crap!

22:06.313 --> 22:07.681
Did I just die again?

22:07.682 --> 22:08.851
You'll-you'll respawn in a minute.

22:08.852 --> 22:10.630
But a pro tip: don't
block with your face.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.351
Right, I respawn.

22:12.352 --> 22:14.313
Not sure I want to do that.

22:14.315 --> 22:16.641
Oh! Killer in the house.

22:16.642 --> 22:19.471
I knew you played. Why'd you stop?

22:19.473 --> 22:22.772
I told you, it was too addictive.

22:22.773 --> 22:24.181
She is so lying.

22:24.182 --> 22:26.141
Did you see how she kind of
moved her head a little bit?

22:26.142 --> 22:27.391
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, yeah.

22:27.392 --> 22:28.813
- Uh-huh.
- There was a guy involved.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.675
- Come on.
- Okay, yes.

22:30.678 --> 22:32.101
- Wes.
- Wes?

22:32.102 --> 22:33.971
He was just this stupid
guy that I had a crush on.

22:33.973 --> 22:35.062
A game designer

22:35.063 --> 22:38.022
that got hooked on his own product,

22:38.023 --> 22:39.431
very ironically,

22:39.432 --> 22:40.812
and soon, that's all he was doing...

22:40.813 --> 22:42.022
Eating and sleeping

22:42.023 --> 22:43.351
in front of the screen.

22:43.352 --> 22:44.391
I had to get out.

22:44.392 --> 22:47.141
Ah, crap. There you go. I died again.

22:47.142 --> 22:49.232
Mm, yeah. Good game.

22:49.233 --> 22:51.062
Great game. Mm-hmm.

22:51.063 --> 22:52.891
I'm gonna go see how
they're doing in court.

22:55.736 --> 22:57.365
Is that Wes?

22:57.369 --> 22:58.506
- Shh.
- That's the dude.

22:58.509 --> 22:59.217
No...

22:59.220 --> 23:00.772
No, that's him.

23:00.773 --> 23:01.851
That's your ex.

23:01.852 --> 23:03.022
- Ooh.
- Enough.

23:03.023 --> 23:05.280
He... he knows where you're at.

23:05.283 --> 23:08.112
You should really get Wes
to analyze Jace's gameplay.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.272
Hundreds, if not thousands of gamers

23:13.273 --> 23:15.601
have analyzed the
footage and not one expert

23:15.602 --> 23:18.351
has said that Jace
deliberately threw the finals.

23:18.352 --> 23:19.562
What do you think, Mendel?

23:19.563 --> 23:20.310
No way he threw it.

23:20.312 --> 23:22.650
Jace hated to lose. And he
would never hurt the team.

23:22.653 --> 23:25.103
Why would Mr. Gallico
make such an accusation?

23:25.983 --> 23:27.691
I couldn't say.

23:27.692 --> 23:30.022
He and Jace had a lot of disagreements.

23:30.023 --> 23:31.022
The owners make millions.

23:31.023 --> 23:32.232
Jace wanted us

23:32.233 --> 23:33.562
to get a bigger piece of the pie.

23:33.563 --> 23:35.793
Not surprisingly, Vin disagreed.

23:35.795 --> 23:37.677
You are one of the best
players in the world,

23:37.678 --> 23:39.638
so I'm assuming that means you have

23:39.640 --> 23:41.730
- one of the highest salaries.
- No, I don't

23:41.732 --> 23:44.114
Make as much as some of
the players on other teams.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.141
Then why not go play for
one of those other teams?

23:46.142 --> 23:48.101
I have a non-compete
clause in my contract.

23:48.102 --> 23:49.191
I'm not allowed to play for another team

23:49.192 --> 23:50.191
for three years if I leave.

23:50.192 --> 23:51.732
But like I said, I'm not complaining.

23:51.733 --> 23:53.312
Because you know what
happens if you do complain?

23:53.313 --> 23:55.224
You get defamed, fired, and blacklisted.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.601
Objection!

23:56.602 --> 23:58.573
Withdrawn.

23:58.576 --> 23:59.826
Nothing further.

24:02.602 --> 24:04.482
Sounds like my boss.

24:04.483 --> 24:06.062
I do all the work, he
makes all the money.

24:06.063 --> 24:08.232
Never thought I'd feel
sorry for these guys.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.522
Roger's hating on Vin.

24:09.523 --> 24:10.901
Yep. Heart rates are elevated,

24:10.902 --> 24:12.562
biometrics show agitation.

24:12.563 --> 24:14.101
The mirrors have moved to eight to four,

24:14.102 --> 24:15.732
but Connie isn't budging.

24:15.733 --> 24:17.601
What happened to the IKEA effect?

24:17.602 --> 24:19.062
Playing the game should have given her

24:19.063 --> 24:21.689
more appreciation for what Jace does.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.851
That ungrateful brat is getting paid

24:23.852 --> 24:25.691
to play video games.

24:25.692 --> 24:28.062
She clearly doesn't
build enough furniture.

24:28.063 --> 24:30.232
We'll have to try a
new strategy for her.

24:30.233 --> 24:32.441
Well, our next witness is Yuna.

24:32.442 --> 24:34.691
Yuna's been prepped to
speak Connie's language.

24:34.692 --> 24:36.022
Yuna, would you say you know Jace

24:36.023 --> 24:37.312
better than anyone?

24:37.313 --> 24:39.441
He's my best friend.

24:39.442 --> 24:40.982
Can you tell us what happened

24:40.983 --> 24:41.982
during the championship game?

24:41.983 --> 24:42.982
He made a mistake.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.191
It happens to all of us.

24:44.192 --> 24:45.967
Thank you. Nothing further.

24:50.273 --> 24:52.482
Had you ever witnessed

24:52.483 --> 24:54.267
Jace make a mistake before that night?

24:54.271 --> 24:55.691
Yeah, a-a few.

24:55.692 --> 24:57.588
Five, a hundred, a thousand?

24:57.591 --> 24:58.691
Closer to five.

24:58.692 --> 25:00.232
You don't get to be world number one

25:00.233 --> 25:01.457
by making a lot of mistakes.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.732
And how many mistakes did
he make during the finals?

25:03.733 --> 25:04.543
He-he made a few.

25:04.544 --> 25:05.351
A few?

25:05.352 --> 25:06.562
Five, a hundred...

25:06.563 --> 25:09.062
Closer to five. He had a bad night.

25:09.063 --> 25:10.772
If in one night,

25:10.773 --> 25:12.772
he made the same number
of mistakes as he'd made

25:12.773 --> 25:14.562
in the previous six years,

25:14.563 --> 25:17.223
it sounds like something
much more than a bad night.

25:19.371 --> 25:20.990
Biometrics are shifting.

25:20.994 --> 25:24.191
Jurors are feeling uneasy with this.

25:24.192 --> 25:25.441
Yuna will be fine.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.812
As long as she sticks to the script.

25:26.813 --> 25:28.199
So, Miss Kim,

25:28.203 --> 25:29.812
over the course of six years of play,

25:29.813 --> 25:30.982
Jace Rundle had a record

25:30.983 --> 25:32.982
of 118 wins and 12 losses.

25:32.983 --> 25:35.812
How do you explain this bad night?

25:35.813 --> 25:37.573
He told me before the
game he had a headache.

25:38.483 --> 25:39.772
A headache?

25:39.773 --> 25:41.642
That's why he lost?

25:42.692 --> 25:45.641
At our level, gamers need to be 100%.

25:45.642 --> 25:47.522
Any little thing can throw us off.

25:47.523 --> 25:49.401
This is new, she didn't mention that.

25:49.402 --> 25:50.691
So much for the script.

25:50.692 --> 25:52.901
Her mouth may be smiling,
but her eyes aren't,

25:52.902 --> 25:55.272
and her speech baseline's
changed to third person.

25:55.273 --> 25:56.419
She's lying.

25:56.422 --> 25:59.601
Biometrics suggest our jurors
sense they're being lied to.

25:59.602 --> 26:00.772
And they don't like it.

26:00.773 --> 26:02.812
Yuna was our kill shot,

26:02.813 --> 26:04.813
and she just tanked the match.

26:15.938 --> 26:18.397
We are still down four to eight.

26:18.398 --> 26:20.147
We have to switch our strategy.

26:20.148 --> 26:22.357
Instead of trying to prove
that Jace was telling the truth,

26:22.358 --> 26:24.776
we have to prove that
Vin was telling a lie.

26:24.777 --> 26:26.957
Yeah, but why would Yuna lie?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.777
Maybe she thought that
Jace threw the game

26:28.781 --> 26:30.137
and was trying to protect him.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.397
I don't think Jace threw it.

26:31.398 --> 26:32.357
Look at this.

26:32.358 --> 26:35.437
So Dewey, his teammate,
went on a shopping spree.

26:35.438 --> 26:37.316
New car, new clothes, new watch...

26:37.317 --> 26:39.236
Wait, so you think Dewey

26:39.237 --> 26:40.552
bet against the team
and tanked the match?

26:40.553 --> 26:42.437
But if Dewey threw the game,

26:42.438 --> 26:43.647
why did Yuna lie?

26:43.648 --> 26:45.317
Chunk's getting to bottom of it.

26:46.398 --> 26:47.397
Hey.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.437
Bull coming?

26:48.438 --> 26:50.486
Nope, just me. Chunk Palmer,

26:50.487 --> 26:51.697
- big fan.
- Thanks.

26:51.698 --> 26:53.526
But since we're here, what do you say

26:53.527 --> 26:54.816
we get a quick game
of the 'Fall in, huh?

26:54.817 --> 26:56.066
I've been working on a couple of moves

26:56.067 --> 26:57.816
I think you're going to
find really interesting.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.607
Uh, sure.

26:59.608 --> 27:01.276
Awesome. All set up.

27:01.277 --> 27:02.397
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

27:02.398 --> 27:04.026
Go.

27:04.027 --> 27:05.816
Are you sure you want to play me?

27:05.817 --> 27:08.438
Oh, yeah. I love this game.

27:16.987 --> 27:18.147
So...

27:18.148 --> 27:19.526
what was that move?

27:19.527 --> 27:20.986
You figure it out?

27:20.987 --> 27:22.697
No idea.

27:22.698 --> 27:24.197
I'll give you a hint.

27:24.198 --> 27:25.566
Yuna committed perjury

27:25.567 --> 27:27.148
and I think you made her do it.

27:29.527 --> 27:31.357
I have no interest in losing the case.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.965
So you decided to game the trial?

27:32.967 --> 27:35.254
I needed a credible story
and everyone loves Yuna.

27:35.256 --> 27:37.107
Your credible story is the truth,

27:37.108 --> 27:40.776
and Yuna is a terrible liar.

27:40.777 --> 27:43.648
Now her credibility, as
well as yours, is gone.

27:44.858 --> 27:46.937
I...

27:46.938 --> 27:48.607
I was just...

27:48.608 --> 27:50.486
Trying to play Bull's game.

27:50.487 --> 27:52.776
Every bit as stupid as me trying

27:52.777 --> 27:54.370
to play your game.

27:54.372 --> 27:59.236
So, did you learn anything?

27:59.237 --> 28:00.566
I need Bull.

28:00.567 --> 28:02.486
Very good. Round two,

28:02.487 --> 28:04.197
we're on the attack.

28:04.198 --> 28:06.198
We're gonna turn the spotlight on Vin.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.397
I like the new place, Wes.

28:13.398 --> 28:14.526
God, it's been, what?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.290
- A year?
- Pretty much.

28:16.293 --> 28:17.857
I think this is the longest

28:17.858 --> 28:19.378
I've seen you away from your keyboard.

28:20.368 --> 28:21.736
How is everything with the game?

28:21.737 --> 28:22.816
Well, actually, I don't...

28:22.817 --> 28:24.198
I don't play anymore.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.316
Really?

28:26.317 --> 28:28.276
Because you messaged me mid-game.

28:28.277 --> 28:31.486
Yeah, well, um, I'm a developer,

28:31.487 --> 28:33.676
so I have to monitor all
the games and everything.

28:33.678 --> 28:35.678
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were monitoring.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.890
Yeah, what can I say? I still love it.

28:39.817 --> 28:40.922
So...

28:42.027 --> 28:45.158
I texted you because I need a favor.

28:46.317 --> 28:48.487
Okay.

28:49.487 --> 28:50.633
I just sent you

28:50.637 --> 28:52.867
the master file of the match Jace lost.

28:52.868 --> 28:54.066
Would you take a look at it for me?

28:54.067 --> 28:56.198
Yeah, of course. Anything for you.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.007
Cool.

28:58.008 --> 28:59.285
Cool.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.657
Mr. Creuster, is it fair to say

29:02.658 --> 29:05.157
you share in the risk
of each player's career?

29:05.158 --> 29:07.066
No, because I take all the risk.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.107
These are untested 18-year-olds

29:09.108 --> 29:11.107
playing video games in
their parents' basement.

29:11.108 --> 29:12.816
I provide room and board, security,

29:12.817 --> 29:15.276
equipment and the best
training money can buy.

29:15.277 --> 29:16.316
They should be paying me.

29:16.317 --> 29:18.316
Jace Rundle was just 19

29:18.317 --> 29:19.867
when you first signed him.

29:19.868 --> 29:22.026
At just over half a mil a year.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.697
And since then, he's amassed

29:23.698 --> 29:27.197
an astonishing win-loss
career of 118 and 12.

29:27.198 --> 29:29.026
118 and 13.

29:29.027 --> 29:29.929
Right.

29:29.932 --> 29:31.157
So why would someone

29:31.158 --> 29:33.066
with such a superlative record

29:33.067 --> 29:34.607
intentionally lose a championship game?

29:34.608 --> 29:36.276
Because there was
something in it for him.

29:36.277 --> 29:38.197
You believe he benefitted financially

29:38.198 --> 29:39.407
by losing?

29:39.408 --> 29:40.970
We'd been discussing a new contract.

29:40.974 --> 29:42.316
He wanted more money,

29:42.317 --> 29:43.776
but I felt that his career was peaking.

29:43.777 --> 29:46.986
And he wanted to show me
just how invaluable he was.

29:46.987 --> 29:49.236
So this was a negotiations ploy?

29:49.237 --> 29:50.276
Yeah.

29:50.277 --> 29:52.066
So you believe Jace lost the game,

29:52.067 --> 29:55.236
knowing that if anyone had
found out what he had done,

29:55.237 --> 29:57.566
it would destroy his
career and reputation?

29:57.567 --> 29:59.276
He didn't think he'd get caught.

29:59.277 --> 30:02.197
He thinks he's bigger than
the game, but no one is,

30:02.198 --> 30:03.736
not even Jace Rundle.

30:03.737 --> 30:05.074
No further questions.

30:05.077 --> 30:07.867
So, you say that the
players should be paying you,

30:07.868 --> 30:09.657
but it seems to me they already are.

30:09.658 --> 30:12.316
Your deductions for
living and travel expenses,

30:12.317 --> 30:15.407
equipment rental, insurance
and management fees,

30:15.408 --> 30:17.947
bring Jace's "just over half a mil"

30:17.948 --> 30:20.316
into just under $73 thousand.

30:20.317 --> 30:22.316
It's not cheap to develop a new player,

30:22.317 --> 30:24.986
and the contract allows
me to recoup my expenses.

30:24.987 --> 30:26.277
Speaking of contracts,

30:26.281 --> 30:28.177
you said you and Jace had a disagreement

30:28.179 --> 30:29.486
over what he was worth?

30:29.487 --> 30:31.467
I just couldn't afford

30:31.469 --> 30:32.759
to give him what he was asking for.

30:32.762 --> 30:34.236
But you had no problem

30:34.237 --> 30:37.367
coming to an agreement
with Jace's teammate,

30:37.368 --> 30:39.407
Dewey Cussler. In
fact, you even gave him

30:39.408 --> 30:41.197
a brand-new contract.

30:41.198 --> 30:42.236
Well, he's...

30:42.237 --> 30:43.486
my new captain.

30:43.487 --> 30:46.276
Worth 10% more than Jace was asking.

30:46.277 --> 30:48.447
First I don't pay my players enough,

30:48.448 --> 30:50.697
and then you're... you're slamming me

30:50.698 --> 30:51.816
for giving them a raise?

30:51.817 --> 30:53.777
So, we've established that

30:53.781 --> 30:55.276
you could afford it.

30:55.277 --> 30:57.447
The question now is, did you fire Jace

30:57.448 --> 31:00.066
because he intentionally
threw the finals,

31:00.067 --> 31:02.066
or did you use the
loss to smear his name

31:02.067 --> 31:04.066
and justify his termination?

31:04.067 --> 31:05.056
Objection!

31:05.064 --> 31:06.816
Did you profit from it, Vin?
Did you have something to do

31:06.817 --> 31:07.757
with the loss?

31:07.758 --> 31:09.092
Objection, Your Honor!

31:09.095 --> 31:10.345
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

31:12.608 --> 31:15.947
$73,000 is more than I've ever made

31:15.948 --> 31:17.607
doing a real job.

31:17.608 --> 31:18.867
Time to show Connie

31:18.868 --> 31:20.368
who hates small animals.

31:23.987 --> 31:27.157
You made a lot more than $73,000
last year, didn't you, Vin?

31:27.158 --> 31:28.657
You made somewhere in the neighborhood

31:28.658 --> 31:30.486
of $8 million.

31:30.487 --> 31:32.107
What are you gonna do next,
whip out my tax returns?

31:32.108 --> 31:33.867
You've been seen driving a Porsche,

31:33.868 --> 31:34.986
a Bentley, a Ferrari.

31:34.987 --> 31:36.316
How many cars do you own?

31:36.317 --> 31:39.198
You forgot about my McLaren.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.197
Yeah, I make a lot of
money. I'm proud of it.

31:43.198 --> 31:44.316
That doesn't change
the fact that Jace got

31:44.317 --> 31:46.026
exactly what he deserved.

31:46.027 --> 31:48.197
Vin's a rabbit killer,

31:48.198 --> 31:50.367
and Jace now works hard for his money.

31:50.368 --> 31:52.526
Connie is swinging hard to our side.

31:52.527 --> 31:53.697
Thank Danny.

31:53.698 --> 31:55.776
She pulled a rabbit's
foot out of the hat.

31:55.777 --> 31:57.486
Connie has two pet rabbits.

31:57.487 --> 32:00.367
She's turning on Vin, and he knows it.

32:00.368 --> 32:01.737
I think the last thing we...

32:01.738 --> 32:03.107
Hey, Jace.

32:03.108 --> 32:04.986
This thing's taking a
lot longer than I thought.

32:04.987 --> 32:07.736
I've got to get back to work,
so how 'bout you drop the suit,

32:07.737 --> 32:10.066
and I'll clear your name,
and I'll take you back?

32:10.067 --> 32:11.776
So you found out about the
rabbit-lover on our jury?

32:11.777 --> 32:13.526
She's not coming around.

32:13.527 --> 32:15.157
Maybe it's time for another key chain.

32:15.158 --> 32:17.448
- Is this a formal settlement offer?
- Yeah.

32:17.450 --> 32:19.088
Take it or leave it.

32:19.091 --> 32:20.880
You've got 24 hours.

32:22.737 --> 32:24.447
Well, we can counter.

32:24.448 --> 32:26.367
I'd rather we win.

32:26.368 --> 32:28.479
It's a good offer.

32:28.483 --> 32:30.486
Is this about what's
doing best for our client,

32:30.487 --> 32:32.407
or getting another
one in the win column?

32:32.408 --> 32:34.107
Have you met our client?

32:34.108 --> 32:36.527
He likes to win, too.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.486
So how long did it take?

32:44.487 --> 32:46.526
For what?

32:46.527 --> 32:48.868
You know, before you realized I left.

32:52.277 --> 32:54.736
Not long. That's why I quit playing.

32:54.737 --> 32:55.986
I'm really sorry.

32:55.987 --> 32:58.158
It was my fault.

33:04.908 --> 33:07.737
You want to get coffee with me Saturday?

33:09.158 --> 33:11.236
Yeah. What time?

33:11.237 --> 33:13.107
Like, around 2:00.

33:13.110 --> 33:15.255
That's the same time as
the Titanfall regionals.

33:15.258 --> 33:16.638
Really? What a coincidence.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.566
Huh.

33:18.567 --> 33:20.067
Think about it.

33:21.996 --> 33:24.745
Uh, so I started with
Dewey, like you asked,

33:24.747 --> 33:26.407
but his play seemed perfectly legit.

33:26.408 --> 33:28.236
So then I moved on to Jace.

33:28.237 --> 33:30.608
Take a look at that.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.816
It's a crap offer, and you know it.

33:34.817 --> 33:37.607
Didn't ask you here to
talk about the offer.

33:37.608 --> 33:39.367
Reviewing my big choke?

33:39.368 --> 33:42.526
I do that, too, in my
head, 50 times a night.

33:42.527 --> 33:44.607
Every gamer has their own style,

33:44.608 --> 33:46.026
and you are no exception.

33:46.027 --> 33:47.303
Okay, I'm with you so far.

33:47.306 --> 33:49.186
Thousands of fans and top shoutcasters

33:49.188 --> 33:51.085
have analyzed your replays.

33:53.345 --> 33:55.134
You didn't throw the game.

33:55.138 --> 33:56.607
There were no deliberate mistakes,

33:56.608 --> 33:58.607
only a few unnatural moves.

33:58.608 --> 34:01.607
Unfortunately, those moves
suggest the possibility

34:01.608 --> 34:03.658
of a neurological disorder.

34:06.525 --> 34:08.775
It's time to face reality, Jace.

34:30.773 --> 34:31.983
Hey.

34:33.902 --> 34:36.731
I was just thinking.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.572
I started playing when I was four.

34:38.572 --> 34:42.521
That's 84% of my life.

34:42.523 --> 34:43.731
100% when you consider

34:43.733 --> 34:46.190
I don't remember anything before then.

34:46.193 --> 34:48.652
I've got nothing else.

34:50.902 --> 34:52.362
What'd the neurologist say?

34:53.733 --> 34:57.101
I...

34:57.101 --> 34:59.193
have Parkinson's.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.102
Sorry.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.602
Parkinson's?

35:06.602 --> 35:10.773
Like, who the hell gets that at 25?

35:13.483 --> 35:15.602
There are medications.

35:15.602 --> 35:17.731
Strategies for treating it.

35:17.733 --> 35:19.642
With treatment,

35:19.642 --> 35:22.401
you can stay in the game for years.

35:22.403 --> 35:24.691
Like a month before the championships,

35:24.693 --> 35:29.061
I knew... I knew something
weird was going on.

35:29.063 --> 35:32.061
My precision was off, my reaction times.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.061
Occasional shakes.

35:33.063 --> 35:36.023
I thought it was just the caffeine.

35:40.733 --> 35:43.142
Have you told anyone?

35:43.142 --> 35:44.901
No.

35:44.903 --> 35:48.271
I, uh, would have told my girlfriend,

35:48.273 --> 35:53.852
but, lucky for her,
we broke up yesterday.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.771
She couldn't handle
being with a loser anyway.

35:55.773 --> 35:57.981
Disease can't make you a loser.

35:57.983 --> 35:59.497
Only you can do that.

35:59.501 --> 36:00.981
Easy for you to say.

36:00.983 --> 36:03.021
This disease took the finals.

36:03.023 --> 36:04.733
Lost me everything.

36:06.943 --> 36:09.191
The timing's bad, I'll give you that.

36:09.193 --> 36:12.231
But we have to talk about today.

36:12.233 --> 36:14.231
This is the last day of the trial.

36:14.233 --> 36:16.142
I need to know what you want to do.

36:16.142 --> 36:17.142
Now?

36:17.144 --> 36:18.142
Yeah.

36:18.142 --> 36:21.059
Does it even matter?

36:21.063 --> 36:24.102
If I tell them about my diagnosis,

36:24.102 --> 36:26.311
they'll know I didn't
mess up on purpose.

36:26.313 --> 36:27.747
And then the world will know,

36:27.751 --> 36:30.231
which means I'll never
play competitively again.

36:30.233 --> 36:33.021
I mean, I'm screwed either way.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.401
Hold on.

36:34.403 --> 36:37.102
What happened to Mr. Double or Nothing?

36:37.102 --> 36:41.102
The man who made me play
36 holes of simulated golf,

36:41.102 --> 36:42.454
just to get a win?

36:44.063 --> 36:46.063
Where's that guy?

36:48.943 --> 36:51.816
I know you got handed
a terrible diagnosis,

36:51.818 --> 36:54.318
but you can't give up.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.360
Not today.

36:58.588 --> 37:02.142
So... what do I do?

37:02.142 --> 37:06.233
What if I told you
there's another option?

37:11.441 --> 37:12.892
Vin.

37:14.387 --> 37:17.271
I made the offer. The
window's closed, guys.

37:17.273 --> 37:19.773
Well, a window closes,
another door opens.

37:19.776 --> 37:20.985
You let Jace back on the team,

37:20.988 --> 37:23.061
as captain, with a three-year contract,

37:23.063 --> 37:25.195
and commensurate raises
for Yuna and Mendel.

37:25.198 --> 37:26.528
Why would I do that?

37:26.530 --> 37:29.231
I've reassessed my
options. I can win this.

37:29.233 --> 37:30.521
And full benefits.

37:30.523 --> 37:32.813
That'll cover treatment
for his Parkinson's disease.

37:32.816 --> 37:34.525
Parkinson's?

37:34.528 --> 37:36.521
What the hell are you talking about?

37:36.523 --> 37:38.021
Look, is this some kind of play?

37:38.023 --> 37:40.401
No play. It's for real.

37:40.403 --> 37:42.642
I just found out.

37:46.068 --> 37:48.142
Hey, I feel for you and everything,

37:48.142 --> 37:50.773
but the offer's gone. The team's filled.

37:53.977 --> 37:56.736
W-What do you want me to do?

37:56.738 --> 37:58.477
If I walk back into that courtroom,

37:58.477 --> 38:00.606
and I tell the jury
about Jace's condition,

38:00.608 --> 38:01.668
you're gonna lose the case

38:01.671 --> 38:03.566
and millions of dollars
in punitive damages.

38:03.568 --> 38:06.106
But if you agree to our settlement,

38:06.108 --> 38:07.977
with a confidentiality clause...

38:10.068 --> 38:11.436
You sure you still want to play?

38:11.438 --> 38:13.106
More than ever.

38:13.108 --> 38:15.146
About one of his new teammates,

38:15.148 --> 38:16.938
there's something you should see.

38:17.874 --> 38:19.753
Yo, yo, Jace.

38:21.798 --> 38:23.316
If it isn't El Capitan.

38:23.318 --> 38:25.146
Congrats, man, I'm
glad you guys settled.

38:25.148 --> 38:28.026
Yeah. Casa DV8 hasn't been the same.

38:28.028 --> 38:29.066
Team.

38:29.068 --> 38:30.704
I missed you, too.

38:31.539 --> 38:33.146
Let's get back to it, bro.

38:33.148 --> 38:34.646
One big, happy family.

38:34.648 --> 38:36.186
You son of a bitch.

38:36.188 --> 38:37.686
A dysfunctional family.

38:37.688 --> 38:39.566
You were a snotnosed little pockmarked

38:39.568 --> 38:40.751
mall rat when I found you.

38:40.755 --> 38:43.066
I think what he's trying
to say is that we analyzed

38:43.068 --> 38:46.236
all the team play, and
when we got to you...

38:46.238 --> 38:48.106
You threw the finals, you bastard.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.066
What? That's ridiculous.

38:50.068 --> 38:52.356
See the slight reddening
around the nose?

38:52.358 --> 38:53.606
The Pinocchio effect.

38:53.608 --> 38:55.276
Offshore accounts aren't

38:55.278 --> 38:56.443
quite as secure as people think.

38:56.445 --> 38:57.525
You'll never play again.

38:57.528 --> 38:59.477
If I ever see you again,

38:59.477 --> 39:01.606
I'll break your hands.

39:05.028 --> 39:07.380
It would appear there is
an opening on the team.

39:07.383 --> 39:09.026
Welcome back to DV8.

39:29.188 --> 39:30.934
Well, look who decided to show up.

39:30.938 --> 39:33.236
You really thought I wouldn't?

39:33.238 --> 39:34.608
So what are we gonna...

39:38.028 --> 39:39.418
Okay.

39:39.421 --> 39:43.856
Well, I'm not thinking
about regionals anymore.

39:43.858 --> 39:45.648
Good, 'cause we're not going.

39:52.028 --> 39:55.396
I am so pumped

39:55.398 --> 39:57.816
to announce that I am bringing back

39:57.818 --> 40:00.066
the number-one player in the world.

40:00.068 --> 40:03.977
Ladies and gentlemen, Jace Rundle.

40:08.233 --> 40:10.146
DV8! DV8!

40:15.782 --> 40:17.191
This marks a new era

40:17.193 --> 40:19.361
in the profession of eSports.

40:19.363 --> 40:23.782
New player contracts
formalized across the league.

40:23.782 --> 40:25.691
Players and owners on equal ground,

40:25.693 --> 40:28.072
taking this epic game

40:28.075 --> 40:30.019
to even greater heights.

40:30.023 --> 40:31.481
Jace Rundle!

40:36.072 --> 40:37.282
"Epic"?

40:37.282 --> 40:38.861
Yeah, well, I thought I should throw

40:38.863 --> 40:41.822
some dude-speak in there
so it would seem authentic.

40:41.822 --> 40:43.072
Mm-hmm.

40:43.072 --> 40:45.441
Sorry you didn't win.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.072
I have a happy client

40:47.072 --> 40:48.611
and a whole lot of players

40:48.613 --> 40:50.282
who are gonna want to renegotiate,

40:50.282 --> 40:52.151
so I'm good.

40:52.153 --> 40:55.481
Plus, we righted some wrongs

40:55.483 --> 40:57.572
in the dawn of a new league.

40:57.572 --> 40:59.072
- Yes, we did.
- Hmm.

41:00.822 --> 41:02.532
You haven't played the game yet.

41:02.532 --> 41:03.941
Not really into games.

41:03.943 --> 41:05.822
Ha. Really?

41:05.822 --> 41:07.242
You were sending a lot of signals.

41:07.242 --> 41:09.742
It seemed like you were interested.

41:09.742 --> 41:11.072
Was I wrong?

41:17.535 --> 41:20.610
Let me put it this way.

41:20.613 --> 41:22.782
You're no longer an employee.

41:23.305 --> 41:29.242
