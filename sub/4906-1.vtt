<i>Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?</i>

00:33.996 --> 00:35.896
<i>Am I too dirty?
Am I too flirty?</i>

00:35.998 --> 00:38.796
<i>Do I like what you like?
Why don't you like me?</i>

00:38.900 --> 00:41.759
<i>Why don't you like me
Without making me try?</i>

00:41.870 --> 00:44.236
<i>I try to be like Grace Kelly</i>

00:45.607 --> 00:48.167
<i>But all her looks were too sad</i>

00:49.711 --> 00:51.975
<i>so I try a little Freddie</i>

00:53.682 --> 00:56.947
<i>I've gone identity mad!</i>

00:57.519 --> 00:59.612
<i>I could be brown
I could be blue</i>

00:59.755 --> 01:01.245
<i>Gotta be everything more</i>

01:01.356 --> 01:03.381
<i>Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?</i>

01:03.492 --> 01:05.221
<i>Why don't you walk out the door?</i>

01:05.327 --> 01:06.919
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Oh, thanks.

01:07.029 --> 01:09.054
I tried banana nut sprout this morning.

01:09.731 --> 01:11.221
Thought, you know,
a little change of pace,

01:11.333 --> 01:14.632
thought somebody deserves
something special for his birthday.

01:14.736 --> 01:15.760
Yeah. It's good.

01:15.871 --> 01:18.635
Okay, so I made
reservations tonight at Babbo at 8:30.

01:18.740 --> 01:22.437
I thought maybe we could talk about,
you know, setting a date?

01:23.445 --> 01:25.970
Did you just make a plan to make a plan?

01:26.114 --> 01:27.979
- Did I just do that again?
- Yeah, you did.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.074
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:30.452 --> 01:32.249
All right, I'll see you later, okay?

01:32.354 --> 01:34.879
- Hey, hey, hey! Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:35.257 --> 01:36.747
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:36.925 --> 01:38.916
- Happy birthday!
- You, too!

01:44.032 --> 01:46.694
Hello, sir.
Would you like to buy some cookies?

01:46.968 --> 01:50.404
I would. I really would. I just...

01:52.107 --> 01:53.506
Unfortunately, I don't have any money.

01:53.775 --> 01:55.743
I don't have any cookies.

01:58.847 --> 01:59.814
Jack?

02:01.350 --> 02:02.942
I need a key.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.258
Wow.

02:11.426 --> 02:13.326
Wow. That...

02:14.830 --> 02:15.819
A key?

02:15.931 --> 02:17.956
What? No! I want a key.

02:18.066 --> 02:20.728
Like an actual key to your apartment
so I don't have to wait outside

02:20.836 --> 02:22.963
when I'm dressed
in these little slutty outfits.

02:23.071 --> 02:25.232
I don't want to live with you.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.171
No offense.

02:27.275 --> 02:29.766
And you know I mean this
in the nicest possible way.

02:29.878 --> 02:33.314
You're not exactly
serious boyfriend/marriage material.

02:33.582 --> 02:35.641
And I pride myself on that.

02:36.651 --> 02:39.051
I gotta go. I'll see you next week.
What're we doing?

02:39.154 --> 02:43.181
Mother of the baby saved from the fire
and the sexy shirtless fireman?

02:44.226 --> 02:46.091
<i>I could be brown
I could be blue</i>

02:46.194 --> 02:48.128
<i>I could be violet sky</i>

02:48.230 --> 02:50.095
<i>I could be hurtful
I could be purple</i>

02:50.198 --> 02:52.063
<i>I could be anything you like</i>

02:52.167 --> 02:54.032
<i>Gotta be green
Gotta be mean</i>

02:54.136 --> 02:56.036
<i>Gotta be everything more</i>

02:56.138 --> 02:57.935
<i>Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?</i>

02:58.039 --> 02:59.836
<i>Why don't you walk out the door?</i>

02:59.941 --> 03:01.806
<i>I could be brown
I could be blue</i>

03:01.910 --> 03:03.844
<i>Gotta be everything more</i>

03:03.945 --> 03:05.845
<i>Why don't you like me?
Why don't you like me?</i>

03:05.947 --> 03:08.142
<i>Why don't you walk out the door?</i>

03:11.820 --> 03:14.254
- McNally.
- Chong.

03:26.401 --> 03:27.368
Not now.

03:27.669 --> 03:31.696
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Here we go! Yeah!
That's looking good! All right!

03:31.807 --> 03:34.742
That's good form right there.
Let's keep that up, huh?

03:34.843 --> 03:38.210
That's a beautiful veneer. Just throw that
on the edge-band and we're set.

03:38.313 --> 03:40.247
- All right!
- Hey, Jack?

03:40.348 --> 03:43.875
- Do you know what time it is?
- What? I can't hear you over the saw.

03:43.985 --> 03:45.475
We're in the zone over here.
I don't want to lose focus.

03:45.587 --> 03:47.282
That's how people lose fingers, huh?

03:47.389 --> 03:50.586
- You're fired.
- All right. We are fired up, boys!

03:50.692 --> 03:52.626
You are fired!

03:54.963 --> 03:56.021
All right.

03:56.731 --> 03:59.325
I'll play you for it. You win, I'm out.

04:00.035 --> 04:02.526
I win. I get a second chance.

04:02.637 --> 04:05.868
It's not a second chance
when you've had a hundred of them.

04:13.048 --> 04:18.041
Oh! Nine-seven! Keeping my job! Yeah!

04:22.224 --> 04:23.816
Okay. All right.

04:23.925 --> 04:26.325
- I'll give you one.
- Do you know what?

04:26.428 --> 04:27.690
You're supposed to be the future boss,

04:27.796 --> 04:30.492
but you're too busy
being the life of the party.

04:30.632 --> 04:33.567
At some point, you're gonna have
to step up and be a man.

04:38.206 --> 04:42.267
- Eight-nine! Unemployment!
- Okay, man. You want to play?

04:45.180 --> 04:47.808
Nine-nine! Food stamps! Tastes so good.

04:53.054 --> 04:56.922
- Okay, that's not even a shot.
- The boss got game! The boss got game!

04:57.692 --> 04:59.785
Ten-nine. This is it, Jack.

05:04.199 --> 05:08.533
- You know what? This is ridiculous.
- You know what? That's your problem.

05:08.637 --> 05:13.074
You can't handle the pressure. As soon
as you think you're going to lose, you quit.

05:16.478 --> 05:17.809
Game over, Jack.

05:17.913 --> 05:20.245
Don't get me wrong.
You're like a son to me.

05:20.348 --> 05:26.184
- Dad, I am your son.
- Yeah, and it's time to cut the cord.

05:26.621 --> 05:28.646
Let's go clean out your desk.

05:32.494 --> 05:35.224
Mason has no idea, not an idea at all.

05:35.430 --> 05:39.127
- That you're pathetic, or...
- What, do you think I went overboard?

05:39.968 --> 05:43.062
No. No, I think it's the exact
right amount of board.

05:43.171 --> 05:45.366
Which is what I am right now.
Can we start drinking?

05:45.473 --> 05:47.805
Of course. Okay, lookit!
These are for Mason.

05:47.909 --> 05:49.035
What's that?

05:49.778 --> 05:51.245
Vegas? I thought you hated Vegas.

05:51.346 --> 05:53.439
I do, but, you know,
that's why they call it a gift tip,

05:53.548 --> 05:57.279
- because it truly is selfless.
- Oh, thanks.

05:59.988 --> 06:02.252
Okay, everyone listen!
I'm going to bring him in,

06:02.357 --> 06:05.485
I'm gonna turn on the lights, and that's
when you yell, "Surprise!"

06:05.594 --> 06:08.062
Oh, that's how a surprise party works!
I'm totally gonna write that down.

06:08.163 --> 06:10.825
Okay. Everyone, hide! Hide, hide, hide!

06:16.404 --> 06:17.735
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hey!

06:17.839 --> 06:20.899
Welcome home. Happy birthday.
Okay, come inside...

06:21.009 --> 06:24.172
- Listen, Joy. We need to talk.
- Okay. Well, let's do it inside. Okay?

06:24.279 --> 06:26.611
No, no, no. I can't, or I'll never do this.

06:26.715 --> 06:28.080
Look, there's no easy way to say this.

06:28.183 --> 06:30.014
Okay, then don't. Okay? Just think it,

06:30.118 --> 06:32.382
and then later, I'll try to figure out
what it was you were thinking.

06:32.487 --> 06:33.681
Okay? Let's just go inside.

06:33.788 --> 06:36.518
No, no, no, no, no, no!
This can't wait, Joy.

06:37.359 --> 06:38.986
You know I have a really important job.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.118
- Right?
- Yeah.

06:40.228 --> 06:43.254
So when I come home,
I want this place to be an escape.

06:43.365 --> 06:46.528
And as of late, it's not.

06:46.835 --> 06:51.169
Yes, the sex is great, okay?
I mean, that's fantastic,

06:51.272 --> 06:55.368
and I can't tell you how much I appreciate
all the things you've been trying

06:55.844 --> 06:56.811
with my butt.

06:58.013 --> 07:00.413
But the rest is so exhausting.

07:00.915 --> 07:05.011
You're so on all the time, with all the
scheduling and planning, it's just...

07:05.654 --> 07:07.849
I don't want to marry you, Joy.

07:09.024 --> 07:10.855
I'm leaving you.

07:12.227 --> 07:15.128
Well, I mean, this is my place, so
technically, you would be the one

07:15.230 --> 07:18.028
that has to leave, but... Are you crying?

07:21.102 --> 07:22.626
Surprise.

07:23.104 --> 07:26.301
- Oh, shitballs.
- Yeah.

07:26.675 --> 07:27.642
Hey!

07:28.143 --> 07:29.804
Hey. Here...

07:31.012 --> 07:32.741
Do you have any idea
how much money I've made him?

07:32.847 --> 07:35.577
You're my lawyer.
Can I sue him for something?

07:35.917 --> 07:38.977
Well, the problem with suing your father
is that he's your dad.

07:39.087 --> 07:40.782
He'd love it. He'd think we were bonding.

07:41.956 --> 07:45.551
Maybe he would be! You don't know.
Take him to court. It might be nice.

07:45.660 --> 07:49.255
- What am I gonna do about money?
- You're just realizing that right now?

07:49.364 --> 07:52.094
- Fascinating.
- I could do a lot of things for money.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.531
I'm good at stuff.

07:53.635 --> 07:56.570
I'll bet you $5
I can finish this beer faster than you.

07:56.671 --> 07:59.231
Really? You're on.

08:02.043 --> 08:03.670
He doesn't even deserve me.

08:03.778 --> 08:05.803
Here's my thought on what we should do
with this whole Mason thing.

08:05.914 --> 08:06.938
- Okay.
- Once a week,

08:07.048 --> 08:08.675
we get some of my brother's
loser-ass friends

08:08.783 --> 08:11.445
to go over to Mason's house,
ring his doorbell,

08:11.553 --> 08:14.386
and when he answers,
they're just gonna, bang,

08:14.489 --> 08:16.923
junkpunch him
right up in his man business

08:17.025 --> 08:18.185
and then he's gonna keel over.

08:18.293 --> 08:21.262
While he's writhing on the ground
screaming, "Why?"

08:21.362 --> 08:23.455
they'll go, "You know why!"

08:24.499 --> 08:26.899
Wow! Did you just think of that?

08:27.001 --> 08:28.662
No, I was thinking about it a lot
on the way over.

08:30.472 --> 08:31.439
You are a child!

08:32.607 --> 08:35.633
- What is that? What is that?
- Double or nothing.

08:35.744 --> 08:37.371
Joy, you're gonna need
to take off this ring.

08:37.479 --> 08:40.039
No, I... I'm just... I'm just gonna...

08:40.148 --> 08:42.639
I'm just going to wear it
on the other hand.

08:43.183 --> 08:44.776
You're on fire. Man, you are on fire.

08:44.886 --> 08:46.854
This is like... I mean, you're lucky.

08:46.955 --> 08:49.321
- I don't feel good.
- We need to capitalize on this.

08:49.424 --> 08:50.413
You know what's gonna
make you feel better?

08:50.525 --> 08:51.514
What?

08:51.659 --> 08:54.822
Where's the one place where
you can step up and be a man?

08:54.963 --> 08:56.055
Community college?

08:56.164 --> 08:59.691
Where can you go where
you can forget all your troubles

08:59.801 --> 09:01.701
and act like a total idiot?

09:01.836 --> 09:05.966
I am talking about one place
and one place only, my friend.

09:06.174 --> 09:07.300
Do not say Vegas.

09:07.509 --> 09:08.476
Please say Vegas.

09:08.643 --> 09:10.304
- Vegas, baby.
- Vegas?

09:10.512 --> 09:11.809
- Las Vegas?
- What?

09:11.913 --> 09:13.778
Swish it around in your mouth a little bit.
Think about it.

09:13.882 --> 09:15.509
- Vegas!
- Vegas.

09:15.617 --> 09:17.551
- Carefree.
- Say it like you mean it.

09:17.652 --> 09:19.381
- Spontaneous.
- I can't hear you!

09:19.487 --> 09:21.079
- Vegas!
- Vegas?

09:21.189 --> 09:23.054
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

09:23.191 --> 09:24.658
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

09:24.759 --> 09:26.590
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

09:31.966 --> 09:33.866
Hello, Las Vegas!

09:38.406 --> 09:39.373
Wow.

09:41.142 --> 09:42.109
Vegas.

09:43.678 --> 09:46.613
Everyone, I'm so sorry,
but our computers are down right now,

09:46.714 --> 09:49.410
so just bear with us, please.
I'm sorry. I know.

09:53.254 --> 09:55.984
Okay, your fiancé is one lucky guy.

09:56.424 --> 09:57.391
I love Vegas!

10:00.695 --> 10:02.526
Time to get a big-boy drink.

10:03.832 --> 10:07.768
I'll have a vodka and a Scotch.

10:14.742 --> 10:19.577
This is where I'm passing out.
Pants, you're out of here.

10:34.395 --> 10:36.522
Did we ever tell you
you scream like a girl?

10:39.267 --> 10:42.168
My eyes! It burns!

10:44.505 --> 10:47.201
My head!
My head and my eyes are burning!

10:47.809 --> 10:48.776
My back!

10:51.679 --> 10:53.670
My nose! My nose now!

11:01.823 --> 11:04.223
Whoa! Whoa! Take it easy!

11:13.968 --> 11:17.870
It's okay! It's okay! They're gay!

11:17.972 --> 11:19.564
- What?
- They're gay!

11:22.744 --> 11:25.508
This... No, no, this is not
what it looks like.

11:25.613 --> 11:27.342
We just...
We all got booked in the same room.

11:27.448 --> 11:31.384
Let's just go downstairs.
I smell an upgrade!

11:32.387 --> 11:34.947
- You guys aren't gay?
- No.

11:41.663 --> 11:43.426
- I got this.
- No.

11:43.865 --> 11:45.890
Just let me handle it, okay?

11:47.201 --> 11:48.168
Okay.

11:48.636 --> 11:51.036
Curtis. You and I have a problem.

11:51.372 --> 11:52.839
I think we both know
how this game works.

11:52.941 --> 11:55.341
I complain, and you tell me
there's nothing you can do,

11:55.443 --> 11:57.741
but we both know that's a big, fat lie,

11:57.979 --> 11:59.970
so why don't you just
save us both the trouble

12:00.081 --> 12:01.446
and type in those special codes

12:01.549 --> 12:03.414
that you know
you're gonna type in eventually

12:03.518 --> 12:07.386
and find me two rooms that are so nice

12:08.022 --> 12:10.217
that it turns my night right back around?

12:10.825 --> 12:13.658
She's awfully hostile for a girl named Joy.

12:15.396 --> 12:18.593
I'm going to do exactly
what you're telling me to do, because

12:19.534 --> 12:20.899
I'm a little frightened of you.

12:21.002 --> 12:22.128
These are penthouse suites.

12:22.236 --> 12:24.636
You can't get any higher than that
without going on the roof,

12:24.739 --> 12:28.539
and you're not allowed on the roof,
because people jump.

12:34.182 --> 12:35.547
Penthouse suites.

12:35.683 --> 12:37.014
- Nice!
- No!

12:37.118 --> 12:38.983
- Yeah.
- That's not bad.

12:39.087 --> 12:40.816
Well, you're welcome.

12:41.622 --> 12:42.919
Now watch and learn.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.086
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, hi. How are you?

12:46.194 --> 12:49.095
I think you just met my friend back there.

12:49.197 --> 12:50.596
Kind of a scary person.

12:50.698 --> 12:52.222
Oh, Egyptian cotton. That's nice.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.891
I want to apologize for her.
For three weeks out of the month,

12:55.003 --> 12:56.903
we get to enjoy
God's most precious creation,

12:57.005 --> 12:58.996
and on week four, the bill arrives.

12:59.107 --> 13:00.904
I know what you mean.

13:01.009 --> 13:03.239
Look, I don't want to push here,

13:03.344 --> 13:07.075
but I know that a man in your position
is capable of producing certain amenities.

13:10.551 --> 13:12.519
Planet Hollywood. Yeah.

13:13.755 --> 13:14.949
VIP!

13:22.463 --> 13:26.331
Hey. So, you're from New York,
we're from New York.

13:27.668 --> 13:30.831
- We're going to Le Cirque, please!
- Come on.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.371
Look, I didn't bring my buddy
all the way out to Vegas

13:35.576 --> 13:37.066
so he could get his ass kicked. Right?

13:37.178 --> 13:38.907
So the least you could do is help me
show him a good time.

13:39.013 --> 13:42.073
Your buddy wouldn't know a good time
if it sat on his face.

13:42.183 --> 13:46.449
Okay, you know what, Stripper?
You are kind of a disgusting skank.

13:46.554 --> 13:48.545
Driver, we'll get out here! Thank you!

13:48.656 --> 13:49.714
- Okay, bye!
- Thank you.

13:49.824 --> 13:52.520
- Use a condom, boys.
- Bye-bye. Bye. Just go!

13:56.397 --> 13:57.989
Oh, come on. One drink.

13:58.099 --> 14:00.533
I'm a pretty fun guy. You can ask around.

14:01.436 --> 14:03.768
Thanks, but we have dinner reservations.

14:03.871 --> 14:06.897
And we have to map out our assault
on the strip.

14:07.475 --> 14:10.273
You have a plan to make plans?

14:15.716 --> 14:16.978
Excuse me?

14:17.819 --> 14:20.344
I bet you look really good
with your hair down.

14:20.455 --> 14:22.514
- My hair is down.
- One drink!

14:24.058 --> 14:25.423
I dare you!

14:33.534 --> 14:36.526
Did I invent hip-hop? No. But I was there.

14:37.071 --> 14:39.437
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:39.807 --> 14:41.468
- So, Joy.
- Yeah?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.339
What brings you to Sin City?

14:43.444 --> 14:46.345
You know, just being spontaneous,

14:46.447 --> 14:48.813
cutting loose, like everyone else.
How about yourself?

14:48.916 --> 14:52.044
Yeah. Me? Oh, I'm here on business.

14:52.153 --> 14:55.020
Big business, actually. I'm...

14:55.123 --> 14:56.613
I'm a pretty important guy

14:56.824 --> 14:58.314
in my field.

14:59.026 --> 15:00.186
Really?

15:01.195 --> 15:02.162
No.

15:03.064 --> 15:04.258
Actually,

15:06.200 --> 15:10.967
I just got fired. So, cheers to that.

15:14.742 --> 15:18.234
<i>I just got dumped, so, salud.</i>

15:19.413 --> 15:22.382
Did I mention that I got fired
by my boss-slash-father?

15:22.483 --> 15:25.941
Did I mention that I threw
a surprise birthday party for my fiancé

15:26.053 --> 15:29.113
and the surprise was that he dumped me
in front of all of our closest friends

15:29.223 --> 15:31.384
while they hid in the closet?

15:31.759 --> 15:33.522
Wow. Okay, you win.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.153
Excuse me.
We're gonna need a whole bottle.

15:36.264 --> 15:39.233
I saved a baby today.
I'm not a hero, though.

15:39.333 --> 15:42.166
- You know what I mean? I'm not a...
- He's married.

15:42.270 --> 15:45.671
This is my lesbian sister.
Tell her about your softball game.

15:45.773 --> 15:47.331
Tell her about your softball team.

15:49.277 --> 15:52.769
What do you say we bet 10-to-1,
with $125 on the hard eight?

15:52.880 --> 15:55.280
- Bets are right there.
- All right. Roll them out.

15:55.383 --> 15:59.080
No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't bet on me winning.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.747
You roll, princess.

16:03.057 --> 16:06.026
All right. Go, 44! 44!

16:10.364 --> 16:12.389
This is my party trick. Here it goes.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.331
What are you gonna do?
Are you going to cut...

16:17.171 --> 16:18.570
You know, you were right about me.

16:18.673 --> 16:19.799
You just cut it off!

16:19.907 --> 16:23.399
It's like you're trying to come in first
but it's somebody else's race.

16:25.146 --> 16:27.774
- It's like Egypt!
- It's amazing!

16:28.015 --> 16:31.109
You never felt good enough,
so you took yourself out of the game.

16:32.587 --> 16:35.613
To everyone who's ever been dumped

16:36.791 --> 16:38.986
and to everyone who has ever been fired,

16:40.294 --> 16:43.263
when I say, "Screw!" you say, "You!"

16:43.431 --> 16:44.989
- Screw!
- You!

16:45.099 --> 16:46.532
- Screw!
- You!

16:47.735 --> 16:48.724
Yes!

16:56.944 --> 16:59.742
I think I just got to the point
where I wasn't even trying.

16:59.847 --> 17:01.371
Why should you try?

17:01.482 --> 17:04.747
I work 80 hours a week
and I don't even know why.

17:05.619 --> 17:07.315
I've been so naughty!

17:07.421 --> 17:09.582
Out of my way! Out of my way!

17:10.290 --> 17:11.815
I'm not usually this honest.

17:12.226 --> 17:13.887
I'm usually not this fun.

17:25.406 --> 17:26.430
The best part is...

17:26.540 --> 17:28.599
- We can really talk.
- Really connect.

17:28.709 --> 17:32.338
Yeah, 'cause you're like the last person
on the planet I'd ever sleep with!

17:32.446 --> 17:34.175
Ever! Ever! Ever!

17:37.051 --> 17:38.951
This is gonna be fun!

18:05.746 --> 18:08.442
Oh, God. Please be fake. Please be fake.

18:11.085 --> 18:12.746
Oh, God.

18:35.076 --> 18:38.705
No, no, please, please, please!
Oh, please, please, no!

18:38.813 --> 18:41.373
You can't get divorced here, okay?
You gotta do it where you live.

18:41.482 --> 18:44.144
Besides, you don't want a divorce,
all right? You want an annulment.

18:44.251 --> 18:47.448
See, what happens in Vegas, you pay for
when you get back home.

18:47.555 --> 18:48.613
That's what the thing is.

18:48.723 --> 18:50.088
Was there any part of the night,

18:50.191 --> 18:53.160
I don't know, maybe, say, the part where
I was about to marry the rebound guy,

18:53.260 --> 18:54.727
that you thought, "Hey, oh my God!

18:54.829 --> 18:57.263
"This is a really good time
for an intervention"?

18:57.365 --> 18:58.354
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

18:58.466 --> 19:01.128
I, like, threw up in my own purse, so...

19:03.671 --> 19:05.138
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.569
- Hi!
- Good morning.

19:09.677 --> 19:11.144
- Morning.
- Good morning.

19:11.245 --> 19:12.940
Morning, morning, morning.

19:13.047 --> 19:16.380
I could use some coffee.

19:16.984 --> 19:18.246
Oh, God, yeah.

19:19.353 --> 19:21.548
Well, what's mine is yours.

19:23.491 --> 19:25.686
Here, well, you want to, uh...

19:26.227 --> 19:28.354
<i>Mi coffee es su coffee.</i>

19:34.402 --> 19:37.132
- This is good orange juice.
- Yeah. It's very good.

19:37.238 --> 19:39.035
It's ridiculously good.
The orange juice is good.

19:39.140 --> 19:41.973
- I don't usually like pulp. You a fan?
- Not really.

19:43.778 --> 19:45.211
- Jack?
- Yes.

19:45.913 --> 19:48.507
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yep.

19:49.383 --> 19:51.442
Yes. Yep. Talk. Sure.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.817
They're so cute together!

19:53.921 --> 19:57.584
If I could make someone dead
with my mind, it would be you.

20:10.304 --> 20:11.532
- Yo.
- Hey.

20:14.842 --> 20:15.831
So!

20:18.879 --> 20:20.904
- Great night, huh?
- Yeah!

20:21.015 --> 20:24.041
I mean, you are a lot of fun, Joy.

20:26.086 --> 20:27.383
- I am?
- Yeah!

20:27.488 --> 20:29.979
A lot of fun. That... I mean, last night was

20:31.992 --> 20:32.959
so

20:33.794 --> 20:35.091
great.

20:35.996 --> 20:39.454
Actually, you know, there was like...
Maybe there was one tiny little thing...

20:39.567 --> 20:41.865
I think I know what you mean.

20:43.671 --> 20:44.933
Okay, this...

20:45.039 --> 20:47.473
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm just going to...

20:47.575 --> 20:49.736
Whoa, whoa. Wait. Are...

20:50.444 --> 20:51.604
Are you

20:52.646 --> 20:54.273
- dumping me?
- You didn't...

20:54.381 --> 20:56.372
No! I was coming down here to dump you!

20:56.484 --> 20:58.179
- Oh! Jeez... Okay, so we're good!
- Yeah!

20:58.385 --> 21:00.683
- Okay, disaster averted!
- You said it!

21:00.788 --> 21:03.154
- Yeah, no. Bullet dodged!
- You betcha!

21:03.257 --> 21:05.282
I mean, pooch unscrewed! Free at last!

21:05.392 --> 21:08.054
- Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
- Okay. I got it, okay?

21:08.162 --> 21:10.494
- Got it.
- Okay. I'm sorry. I...

21:10.764 --> 21:13.597
You just seem like the type of girl
who's looking for a serious relationship,

21:13.701 --> 21:15.566
and I'm not that... I mean, you... Like...

21:15.669 --> 21:18.194
No offense,
but you seem like a lot of work.

21:18.305 --> 21:21.433
Like it would take, like,
a team of guys, and I'm not...

21:22.676 --> 21:26.339
Marriages are an outdated concept...

21:26.480 --> 21:28.243
Are you dumping me again?

21:28.349 --> 21:31.580
- I'm in a really weird place right now...
- Where's that, Jack? The starting line?

21:31.685 --> 21:36.019
Because I have news for you, buddy.
The gun went off a long time ago.

21:36.323 --> 21:38.484
Okay! Look at that!
Good luck with the job, huh?

21:38.592 --> 21:41.083
"Employee handles criticism poorly!"

21:42.162 --> 21:44.130
Well, then maybe
you should teach a seminar, Jack,

21:44.231 --> 21:46.597
considering you can't even keep a job
with your own father!

21:46.700 --> 21:49.965
You know, the one person who's
biologically programed to love you,

21:50.070 --> 21:52.368
and even he can't stand you!

21:52.573 --> 21:56.134
Look at that. You had to come all the way
to Vegas and marry a complete stranger

21:56.243 --> 22:00.077
just to prove that you're not a robot.
Congratulations, Joy! That was a feeling!

22:00.180 --> 22:02.648
Oh, I have a feeling, all right!
It's called nausea!

22:02.750 --> 22:04.650
Yeah?
"Oh, I have a feeling, all right!

22:04.752 --> 22:05.719
"It's called nausea!"

22:05.853 --> 22:08.481
- How old are you, five?
- Six, actually. I'm six.

22:08.589 --> 22:09.715
You know, this is why we'd never work.

22:09.823 --> 22:13.953
'Cause I could never, ever be with
someone that's so completely broken!

22:14.161 --> 22:15.458
- Broken?
- Broken!

22:15.563 --> 22:17.724
Broken. You know what?
You don't even know me, mister!

22:17.831 --> 22:20.493
No, I don't know you,
and I got a feeling that neither do you.

22:20.601 --> 22:22.159
You know what?
I'll call you about the annulment.

22:22.269 --> 22:25.898
How about this?
Why don't you just e-mail me?

22:27.508 --> 22:28.497
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

22:28.609 --> 22:31.305
- We'll always have Vegas!
- Hey! That's my quarter!

22:52.266 --> 22:53.597
What the...

22:53.701 --> 22:56.670
<i>We are the champions, my friends</i>

22:58.939 --> 23:02.500
<i>And we'll keep on fighting
till the end</i>

23:02.610 --> 23:05.909
I'm really, really rich!
I'm really, really rich!

23:06.513 --> 23:07.480
<i>We are the champions</i>

23:07.581 --> 23:09.378
That was my quarter!

23:10.351 --> 23:13.081
<i>We are the champions</i>

23:13.187 --> 23:15.815
- We did it!
- Richest man in the world!

23:15.923 --> 23:17.914
<i>No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions</i>

23:18.025 --> 23:21.461
A big giant check! I'm so happy!
I've never been...

23:22.296 --> 23:23.923
I'm really happy!

23:24.398 --> 23:26.491
Oh, my God! That was my quarter!

23:28.902 --> 23:31.029
Congratulations!
You just quadrupled your investment!

23:31.138 --> 23:32.867
What, you think this is all yours? God!

23:32.973 --> 23:37.069
Yes, it's mine. I put the quarter
in the machine and I pulled the lever.

23:37.177 --> 23:41.443
My quarter on the machine that I was
using, the one I loosened up for you!

23:41.949 --> 23:43.780
That's right! Now if you'll excuse me,

23:43.884 --> 23:46.751
I have a giant colorful check to deposit!

23:47.688 --> 23:50.851
Whatever happened to
"What's mine is yours, baby"?

23:51.892 --> 23:54.884
We're married now, remember?

23:59.533 --> 24:04.095
More importantly, Your Honor, my client
only knew Miss McNally for four hours

24:04.204 --> 24:05.728
before they "got married,"

24:05.873 --> 24:08.637
three and a half of which were spent
in a state of

24:08.742 --> 24:10.369
total inebriation.

24:11.211 --> 24:12.178
Mmm-hmm.

24:12.379 --> 24:14.609
You. Other one.

24:14.715 --> 24:17.980
You have any evidence that you both
knowingly entered into this marriage,

24:18.085 --> 24:19.552
that it's not just a sham?

24:19.653 --> 24:20.984
Let me see.

24:22.056 --> 24:24.581
Would a note do?

24:25.826 --> 24:27.259
It's a start.

24:31.799 --> 24:34.666
And then there's a photo.

24:36.570 --> 24:37.662
Nice.

24:39.373 --> 24:40.704
I didn't know anything about that.

24:40.808 --> 24:42.298
There's also

24:44.411 --> 24:47.539
<i>- a video.
- And I am going to provide for her,</i>

24:47.648 --> 24:49.513
<i>I'm gonna love her,</i>

24:50.250 --> 24:52.343
<i>and I'm going to provide for her,</i>

24:52.453 --> 24:54.751
<i>- 'cause we're married!
- Married!</i>

24:56.023 --> 24:57.991
<i>We're all gonna get laid!</i>

24:59.760 --> 25:02.160
Was that you, Cueball? His lawyer?

25:02.963 --> 25:05.523
I didn't... I don't have my glasses on.

25:10.704 --> 25:12.399
I don't like you.

25:12.506 --> 25:14.235
I don't like any of you.

25:14.341 --> 25:17.902
Your generation,
with your Vegas and your Internet

25:18.011 --> 25:20.206
and your "I want it right now."

25:20.347 --> 25:23.248
You know, gay people aren't destroying
the sanctity of marriage,

25:23.350 --> 25:24.681
you people are.

25:24.785 --> 25:27.379
Marriage is about love and commitment.

25:27.488 --> 25:33.017
Listen, I've been married for 25 years
to the same wonderful, infuriating woman,

25:33.127 --> 25:35.721
and granted, there are days
when I want to light her on fire,

25:35.829 --> 25:38.389
but I don't, because I love her,

25:38.499 --> 25:39.898
and that would be illegal.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.865
And you know something?
I might be old-fashioned,

25:41.969 --> 25:46.167
but when I said those vows out loud,
I meant them.

25:46.273 --> 25:48.173
This guy is such a douche.

25:48.275 --> 25:50.971
Before, or should I say if

25:51.078 --> 25:53.478
I ever allow either of you
out of this marriage,

25:53.580 --> 25:55.514
I'm going to make sure
that you try everything,

25:55.616 --> 25:58.813
and I do mean everything, first
to make it work.

25:58.919 --> 26:00.887
- Objection, Your Honor. You can't do that.
- Objection!

26:00.988 --> 26:03.889
Watch me. Now, do either one of you
have a place to live?

26:03.991 --> 26:06.357
I don't at the moment, Your Honor,
but I will.

26:06.460 --> 26:08.223
You see, I...

26:08.328 --> 26:10.489
My ex-fiancé and I broke up, and...

26:10.597 --> 26:14.226
You know, Mrs. Fuller, you're not helping
make your case here, okay?

26:14.968 --> 26:17.903
What about you, pretty boy?
You got a crash pad?

26:18.438 --> 26:21.373
- Yes.
- Okay, great! We have a hearth!

26:21.508 --> 26:24.944
I am freezing the $3 million
for the next six months

26:25.078 --> 26:28.775
and sentencing you two
to six months hard marriage.

26:28.882 --> 26:30.474
And so I can keep an eye on you,

26:30.584 --> 26:33.815
I'm ordering you both
into weekly marital counseling.

26:33.921 --> 26:35.821
I want you two to listen to me.

26:35.923 --> 26:41.088
You better play by my rules on this,
or I'm gonna tie this money up in litigation

26:41.195 --> 26:43.891
that is so long,
so protracted, so expensive

26:43.997 --> 26:47.899
that neither one of you
will ever see a dime of it.

26:48.669 --> 26:51.502
All right. Anything...
Oh, yeah! One more thing.

26:51.638 --> 26:54.106
I now pronounce you man and wife!

26:59.112 --> 27:00.704
Can he do that?

27:00.814 --> 27:02.611
Yeah, he's the judge.
He can do whatever he wants.

27:02.749 --> 27:04.546
And he clearly wants to make an example
out of you both.

27:04.651 --> 27:06.516
If you just do what the guy says,

27:06.620 --> 27:08.554
he's gonna be forced
to grant you a divorce.

27:08.655 --> 27:10.020
- In which case...
- You would probably...

27:10.123 --> 27:11.090
...split...
...the money...

27:11.225 --> 27:12.749
...equally as marital property.

27:12.860 --> 27:14.521
You didn't do anything in there!

27:14.628 --> 27:15.890
- What?
- You didn't do anything!

27:15.996 --> 27:18.897
I called her a vixen! I called her a vixen!

27:20.500 --> 27:21.489
- So?
- So.

27:21.602 --> 27:22.864
I can do anything for six months.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.269
I can not wear pants for six months.
So if you aren't up to it...

27:26.373 --> 27:28.000
Oh, I am so up to it.

27:28.108 --> 27:30.508
And if you're trying to insinuate
that I'm the one that can't do this,

27:30.611 --> 27:33.136
then you are sorely mistaken, short bus.

27:33.247 --> 27:35.078
Whoa! Okay! So it's settled, then.

27:35.182 --> 27:37.480
All right. Think of it
as a business arrangement.

27:37.584 --> 27:40.485
Be married for six months,
get $1.5 million.

27:41.455 --> 27:44.481
- How hard can it be?
- I know how hard it isn't.

27:46.493 --> 27:49.018
Excuse me. Out of my way. Thank you.

27:51.598 --> 27:53.964
- Oh, Jesus. Here.
- Great.

27:58.906 --> 27:59.873
Smile for the camera.

27:59.973 --> 28:02.464
Hi, hubby, it's me. Open up.

28:02.576 --> 28:03.736
Hiya!

28:04.211 --> 28:05.200
<i>It's all the way at the top.</i>

28:05.979 --> 28:06.946
She's here.

28:08.215 --> 28:09.307
Okay, don't overdo it, though.

28:12.352 --> 28:16.413
Hey! Look what I brought my new hubby!

28:16.523 --> 28:19.788
'Cause I want to please him,
and men, they like the beer.

28:19.893 --> 28:24.159
Hey, look who's being a good wifey,
really trying to make her marriage work.

28:24.264 --> 28:26.289
Oh, muffin pants, what a wonderful gift.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.961
I'm going to buy you a big box of Tampax
just so I can thank you,

28:30.070 --> 28:32.595
'cause that's what good husbands do.

28:37.978 --> 28:39.673
Sorry, I can't control myself
when I'm around you,

28:39.780 --> 28:41.839
I just love you so much!

28:41.949 --> 28:43.041
Not as much as I love you!

28:46.086 --> 28:47.951
Shall we, Mrs. Fuller?

28:48.922 --> 28:50.685
Oh. Here. Let me get this.

28:50.791 --> 28:52.224
- Let me get that. Oh.
- Wait a sec.

28:53.794 --> 28:55.523
Slippery. Slippery.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.067
What?

29:05.005 --> 29:07.599
Sorry, baby,
just you're a little on the heavy side.

29:07.708 --> 29:09.699
Welcome home, sweetheart.

29:11.611 --> 29:14.136
You literally have a bar
in the middle of your living room.

29:14.247 --> 29:15.544
It's not so bad.

29:15.649 --> 29:18.584
I mean, I would never live here, ever, but...

29:18.685 --> 29:21.483
What? I ran
the New York City Marathon, okay?

29:21.588 --> 29:24.250
I can do this. I can totally do this.

29:27.194 --> 29:28.491
Oh, my God.

29:29.296 --> 29:30.854
I can't do this!

29:30.964 --> 29:32.454
Don't throw any of that hair away, okay?

29:32.566 --> 29:34.966
I'm saving it up
to make you something special,

29:35.068 --> 29:37.559
like a hat or a sweater.

29:37.671 --> 29:39.662
I still haven't decided yet.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.935
Do you train monkeys in here?

29:42.376 --> 29:46.403
Seriously! It's one thing if you like a guy,
you put up with disgusting stuff like this,

29:46.513 --> 29:49.880
but you I don't care for, so clean it up.

29:49.983 --> 29:53.475
I'm not here under court order,
so I'm going to take off.

29:53.587 --> 29:55.077
- Later, buddy.
- Bye.

29:56.056 --> 29:57.353
$1.5 million.

29:58.258 --> 30:01.625
Here. These are antibacterial. Get to work.

30:10.037 --> 30:12.232
That looks like it's gonna be
comfortable for you.

30:12.339 --> 30:14.102
Where's the bedroom?

30:15.175 --> 30:19.111
- Uh... It's in there.
- Sweet dreams.

30:19.212 --> 30:20.304
Yeah.

30:22.949 --> 30:24.416
What is this?

30:28.221 --> 30:30.849
Ooh. That was close.

30:33.093 --> 30:35.425
- That stinks.
- Just a little bit of me.

30:35.529 --> 30:38.862
- Oh, God!
- And some other people. Whatever.

30:59.252 --> 31:02.221
- Do you need some help?
- Yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

31:02.322 --> 31:04.153
You should probably call somebody.

31:04.257 --> 31:05.246
What?

31:05.358 --> 31:07.918
- To help you.
- Okay, can I sleep on the couch?

31:08.028 --> 31:09.052
No.

31:26.179 --> 31:27.669
Smoothies!

31:33.153 --> 31:34.711
- Hon?
- Yeah.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.345
If I could just get in there for a sec.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.887
I'm almost done. I'll be right out.

31:37.991 --> 31:39.720
No, no. "Be right out"
is not really gonna work.

31:39.826 --> 31:41.691
Like, be right out right now.

31:42.562 --> 31:43.824
I'm almost done!

31:54.875 --> 31:56.035
Okay...

31:58.778 --> 32:01.144
Oh, yeah, this is happening.

32:01.915 --> 32:03.974
You only have yourself to blame.

32:04.084 --> 32:06.609
By the way, it's your day on dishes.

32:18.298 --> 32:19.287
Freak.

32:19.399 --> 32:20.661
Where do you get your underwear?
The hospital?

32:20.767 --> 32:23.463
- What?
- Seriously, what's up with the P.E. bra?

32:23.570 --> 32:27.336
Well, it's comfy and supportive,
like a man should be.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.536
You women. In the beginning it's all, like,
laces and rainbows and trapdoors.

32:31.645 --> 32:35.240
As soon as you get married, it's nothing
but these flesh tones and PMS pants.

32:35.348 --> 32:36.815
You might as well wear a placard
around your neck

32:36.917 --> 32:39.249
- that says, "We're not having sex, ever."
- Ever!

32:39.352 --> 32:40.444
- Ever.
- Ever!

32:40.554 --> 32:43.250
What happened to the purple bra
from Vegas? That was nice.

32:43.356 --> 32:46.587
I'm going to save that
for my non-retarded husband.

32:48.328 --> 32:51.229
Well, the grownups have to go
to work today.

32:51.998 --> 32:54.990
- What are you going to do all day?
- I don't know yet.

32:55.101 --> 32:58.593
I'd rather do nothing and be happy
than do something I know I don't love.

32:58.705 --> 33:00.502
Words to live by, Yanni.

33:00.607 --> 33:02.575
Beat it, worker drone.
Tell the man I say hi.

33:02.676 --> 33:05.645
- Whatever, loser.
- Hey, don't get hit by a bus.

33:05.745 --> 33:07.144
Or do. Whatever.

33:08.315 --> 33:10.340
<i>I believe in miracles</i>

33:10.984 --> 33:14.351
<i>Where you from,
you sexy thing</i>

33:16.122 --> 33:17.851
<i>I believe in miracles</i>

33:19.893 --> 33:23.590
<i>since you came along,
you sexy thing</i>

33:36.343 --> 33:37.867
<i>- McNally.
- What are you wearing, baby?</i>

33:37.978 --> 33:39.946
<i>- Who is this?
- Your boss.</i>

33:41.114 --> 33:42.638
Get the Chonger
and get up here right away.

33:42.749 --> 33:45.877
Coming right up! Okay.
Banger needs to see us upstairs.

33:45.986 --> 33:49.581
After 15 years of loyal service,
we're dumping Bob whatshisname,

33:49.689 --> 33:52.681
which means that this office
is gonna be up for grabs.

33:52.792 --> 33:54.953
So, I'm going to promote one of you skirts
out of the pit.

33:55.061 --> 33:57.962
And that's not sexual harassment.
Believe me, I've checked.

33:58.064 --> 34:00.430
You're my top guns, girls. Do me proud.

34:00.533 --> 34:02.023
Thank you, sir.

34:03.303 --> 34:05.794
So! I guess I'll be Maverick
and you can be Goose.

34:05.905 --> 34:08.965
Be whoever you want to be,
you'll still gonna be my subordinate.

34:09.074 --> 34:11.804
- Excuse me?
- It's from the Latin, meaning "my bitch."

34:11.911 --> 34:13.844
- What is wrong with you?
- I eat girls like you.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.972
- Oh, you eat girls!
- Not like that.

34:16.081 --> 34:17.071
- Makes total sense.
- It shouldn't.

34:17.183 --> 34:18.514
- No judgments.
- But I'm not...

34:18.618 --> 34:19.710
Just saying.

34:27.193 --> 34:28.353
Ready to do this?

34:28.460 --> 34:32.261
Pretend like you don't make me vomit
in my nose every time I look at you?

34:33.099 --> 34:34.225
Yes.

34:35.467 --> 34:39.370
So, Jack, tell me about yourself.
What are your hobbies?

34:40.373 --> 34:41.704
Hobbies.

34:42.542 --> 34:44.737
You mean, besides my marriage?

34:46.413 --> 34:47.641
My hobbies.

34:47.746 --> 34:49.840
Mostly, I just like loving her.

34:49.949 --> 34:51.746
It's just so easy.

34:54.286 --> 34:55.618
What else?

34:56.255 --> 35:01.785
Listening. I love listening
to what she has to say. It's just...

35:01.895 --> 35:05.228
In fact, actually,
I carry this notebook around with me,

35:05.332 --> 35:09.234
just so I can write it down,
because usually it's so important.

35:09.903 --> 35:14.067
What else?
I think just being there for her, in general.

35:15.608 --> 35:17.701
Loving her until it hurts.

35:18.578 --> 35:19.840
It hurts.

35:20.480 --> 35:24.246
That's... I don't know,
that's probably most of my interests.

35:26.986 --> 35:28.385
Joy?

35:28.488 --> 35:30.080
I'd have to agree.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.658
And I'd have to add, you know,

35:33.727 --> 35:35.126
staring at him.

35:35.228 --> 35:39.597
Yeah. I mean, I just love watching him be.

35:39.699 --> 35:40.996
I love everything about him.

35:41.101 --> 35:43.467
Most people would be repulsed,

35:43.570 --> 35:46.630
you know, to find his socks
and his dirty underwear

35:46.740 --> 35:49.504
sort of down shoved
in the bottom of the bed,

35:49.609 --> 35:51.236
touching them in the middle of the night.

35:51.344 --> 35:53.642
They might want to try
to, like, scrub and scrub and scrub

35:53.747 --> 35:57.683
and try to get the stains
and the scent off of them, but...

35:58.885 --> 36:02.651
Not me. I just... I love it!

36:02.789 --> 36:06.748
I just...
I kind of want to just roll around in it!

36:09.629 --> 36:11.620
Her candles smell awesome!

36:14.200 --> 36:16.566
You know, I do have a few degrees,

36:16.669 --> 36:20.264
and I went to a bunch
of really expensive schools.

36:20.373 --> 36:24.104
Anyway, I'm not buying any of the bullshit
you two are selling today.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.770
Now, if you want me to report back
to the court

36:26.880 --> 36:28.643
that you're both working
on your marriage,

36:28.748 --> 36:31.376
you're gonna actually have to do that.

36:34.921 --> 36:41.759
<i>And love
such a silly game we play, oh!</i>

36:41.861 --> 36:46.355
<i>Like a summer's day in May
What is love, what is love?</i>

36:46.466 --> 36:50.994
<i>I just want it to be love
Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

36:52.439 --> 36:58.969
<i>I, I, I, I, I
I can feel it in your kiss</i>

36:59.479 --> 37:03.779
<i>It just gives me tender bliss
What is love, what is love?</i>

37:03.883 --> 37:06.113
<i>I just want it to be love</i>

37:06.219 --> 37:09.746
Yes, that is the topping I wanted
on my popcorn.

37:09.856 --> 37:11.619
I know that the box said
"movie theater butter,"

37:11.724 --> 37:13.521
but, you guessed it,

37:13.626 --> 37:17.221
what I really wanted
was Jack's Sweaty Ballsack flavor.

37:17.330 --> 37:18.490
Thanks.

37:18.598 --> 37:21.999
<i>Uh! Uh! Uh! Love</i>

37:22.802 --> 37:27.569
<i>Who can tell me I am lost?
What is love, what is love?</i>

37:27.674 --> 37:30.438
I'm just giving you
what you wanted, baby.

37:32.745 --> 37:37.682
Pay attention.
See how it goes up and down. Okay?

37:37.784 --> 37:39.149
It goes up,

37:39.719 --> 37:42.415
and then it goes down. Like that.

37:42.522 --> 37:44.717
See that? Isn't that magical? Amazing.

37:44.824 --> 37:47.054
Watch one more time. One more time.

37:47.160 --> 37:51.790
It goes up, right? And then it goes down.

38:11.017 --> 38:13.815
No, no, no, no! Why?

38:15.722 --> 38:19.385
I really, really need to get in there!

38:19.492 --> 38:22.427
Why don't you just use
your special bathroom?

38:22.662 --> 38:23.959
There's no heavy side!

38:24.063 --> 38:26.258
- You got the window!
- No, that's actually the light side.

38:39.512 --> 38:41.912
- Where's the bathroom door?
- We got robbed.

38:42.048 --> 38:44.312
And all they took was the door.

38:46.686 --> 38:48.415
$1.5 million.

38:50.056 --> 38:52.547
Marriage is hard!

38:52.659 --> 38:55.355
I don't know how people do this.
It's unnatural.

38:55.461 --> 38:58.123
Men and women are not meant to coexist.

38:59.599 --> 39:02.591
And I haven't had sex in forever.
I mean, forever!

39:02.702 --> 39:04.693
And I need to have sex,
'cause I'm good at it!

39:04.804 --> 39:06.931
That's a self-esteem booster for me.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.009
- I don't know if I can do this, man.
- Oh, really?

39:10.109 --> 39:12.873
'Cause I haven't been sensing that at all.

39:12.979 --> 39:14.378
That's why I did a little research.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.038
I've been looking through some case law,

39:16.149 --> 39:18.083
you know, some precedent
to help us get around the ruling.

39:18.184 --> 39:21.153
<i>And I think I found one. Lafferty v. Holden.</i>

39:22.021 --> 39:24.922
You know, Tip,
I don't know if I can do this.

39:25.658 --> 39:26.852
Then we go to plan B.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.053
Mother's third marriage
was to this 20-year-old

39:29.162 --> 39:31.960
club-footed Cuban bartender
who came into a ton of money.

39:32.365 --> 39:34.128
The court said
that if they both wanted the money,

39:34.233 --> 39:36.997
they had to remain married and prove
they can make it work. Sound familiar?

39:37.103 --> 39:39.071
Mother wasn't going to see a cent of that,

39:39.172 --> 39:41.402
but then she proved
that he'd been unfaithful,

39:41.507 --> 39:43.532
and the judge ruled in her favor.

39:43.643 --> 39:45.677
And gave her all the money.

39:46.679 --> 39:49.614
See, the judge said that you had to prove

39:49.716 --> 39:51.377
that you were trying
to make the marriage work.

39:51.484 --> 39:53.884
But if we can make it seem like she isn't...

39:53.987 --> 39:55.682
I don't know
why I haven't thought of this before!

39:55.788 --> 39:57.517
- Because you're not a very good lawyer.
- Oh, my God.

39:57.624 --> 40:00.457
There should be a law
against how bad a lawyer I am.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.549
But then again, I wouldn't know about it!

40:01.661 --> 40:04.528
So if I can get Jack to end the marriage
by either leaving me

40:04.631 --> 40:06.963
or cheating on me...

40:07.066 --> 40:08.556
Not only would you get out
of the marriage...

40:08.668 --> 40:12.104
- You will also get the full $3 million.
- Oh, my God.

40:12.605 --> 40:15.267
- I love you! I want to kiss you.
- You want to kiss me?

40:15.375 --> 40:17.468
On your big, beautiful,
prematurely balding man dome.

40:17.577 --> 40:18.771
All right! All right. Okay.

40:19.212 --> 40:21.237
- Game on, sister!
- Game on!

40:21.514 --> 40:23.175
- Game on.
- Game on.

40:24.384 --> 40:26.784
Destroy it. Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus!

40:45.405 --> 40:47.566
There are some refinery problems
in the South,

40:47.674 --> 40:50.370
- so let's keep our eye on crude oil.
- Oh, that's too bad.

40:50.476 --> 40:51.738
And I just heard a rumor

40:51.844 --> 40:54.904
that the platinum futures
are gonna be very active today.

40:55.014 --> 40:56.038
Yes!

40:57.150 --> 40:58.208
Yeah!

40:59.585 --> 41:02.418
I mean, really, let's do this mother!
Oh, my God.

41:02.522 --> 41:05.821
Right, guys? I mean, let's buy shit!
Let's buy shit!

41:07.093 --> 41:09.027
Do you see that? Do you see that, people?

41:09.128 --> 41:12.393
That's exactly the kind of spirit
I'm talking about!

41:12.498 --> 41:14.227
- You go, girl!
- Yes!

41:16.035 --> 41:18.560
Oh, my God, seriously, you guys!

41:23.676 --> 41:26.270
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What are we doing? What are we doing?

41:29.182 --> 41:30.979
What's happening? What's happening?
Oh, my God.

41:36.422 --> 41:38.720
Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch!

41:51.270 --> 41:52.259
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:52.371 --> 41:54.396
We got locked out of our apartment.

41:54.507 --> 41:57.840
Would you mind if we just waited in here
until the locksmith comes?

41:57.944 --> 42:00.504
He said it would only be a few hours.

42:01.781 --> 42:03.009
A few...

42:03.816 --> 42:04.942
Sure.

42:05.051 --> 42:06.143
- Thank you!
- Great!

42:06.252 --> 42:09.187
Also, we were supposed to have
some friends over tonight.

42:09.288 --> 42:11.984
Do you mind if they waited in here, too?

42:12.959 --> 42:15.450
I'll jump on that grenade, too, I suppose.

42:15.561 --> 42:16.960
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:17.063 --> 42:20.032
- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you. Thank you.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.959
Welcome to my humble abode.

42:25.304 --> 42:27.534
Those are probably my friends.

42:30.343 --> 42:31.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:31.944 --> 42:33.536
We're the friends.

42:33.946 --> 42:36.380
- You look like the friends. You do.
- Hi.

42:38.117 --> 42:40.244
- Hey.
- There is a hot girl party going on

42:40.353 --> 42:42.583
- in my living room.
- What are you talking about?

42:42.688 --> 42:46.283
I'm talking about the fact that there are
a buttload of beautiful women...

42:46.392 --> 42:49.759
Oh, my God. Okay, there's a pillow fight
about to break out.

42:49.862 --> 42:51.659
Oh, my God. Dude, it's a trap.

42:53.332 --> 42:55.596
No, it's not! No! This happens!

42:55.701 --> 42:57.225
No! It doesn't happen!

42:57.570 --> 42:59.970
<i>Get out of the house!
Get out of the house right now!</i>

43:00.072 --> 43:01.505
She must have figured out
the same thing we did.

43:02.141 --> 43:04.075
Okay, just because Joy sets a trap

43:04.177 --> 43:05.474
doesn't mean we can't play at
the same game.

43:05.578 --> 43:07.671
<i>You call Bear, you call every guy we know.</i>

43:07.780 --> 43:09.441
And get some boring stockbroker
kind of guys,

43:09.549 --> 43:10.914
the kind of guys
you and me would beat up.

43:11.050 --> 43:12.210
The more boring, the better.

43:12.318 --> 43:14.377
She has no idea
what she's gotten herself into.

43:20.226 --> 43:21.454
You okay?

43:27.166 --> 43:29.862
In here, guys. Yo, Jack, what up?

43:37.610 --> 43:40.238
This chick's the reason
we're not spending our money right now.

43:40.346 --> 43:43.679
This chick is the reason
I'm not having a six-way right now!

43:44.150 --> 43:45.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:45.818 --> 43:49.219
So, look. This isn't working.
I think we need to call in some sluts.

43:49.322 --> 43:51.688
- Sluts? I know sluts.
- Make the call.

43:51.791 --> 43:55.090
Which one of these ugly losers
is ruining your life?

43:56.262 --> 43:58.753
That one. The pink parade over there.

43:59.131 --> 44:00.928
That's your wife?

44:01.701 --> 44:04.966
Oh, my God, she is so f-ing hot!

44:07.139 --> 44:09.004
What is wrong with you?

44:11.377 --> 44:13.675
Pick a team. Pick a team.
Pick a team! Right now! Pick a team.

44:13.779 --> 44:15.246
- Come on.
- Hers. Hers! Hers!

44:15.348 --> 44:19.808
Listen up, girls. Do whatever you need
to do to get into his pants.

44:19.952 --> 44:21.852
Ignore her.
Don't even make eye contact with her.

44:21.954 --> 44:24.684
Look at every girl in here except for her.
It'll drive her crazy.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.382
Get him drunk. It'll slip right out.

44:26.492 --> 44:27.516
Go!

44:35.434 --> 44:36.423
Hi.

44:42.942 --> 44:44.375
Oh, I get it.

44:44.944 --> 44:47.469
I get what you guys are doing. Okay.

44:48.147 --> 44:50.945
Well, I'm going to...
Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me.

44:51.050 --> 44:52.449
Oh, God!

44:53.419 --> 44:58.447
If you need anybody to talk to,
you know, just let me know.

45:02.461 --> 45:04.793
- Thanks.
- Get out of here. Get out of here.

45:04.897 --> 45:07.263
Get out of here!
Get out of here, both of you!

45:07.366 --> 45:08.333
I'll give her the money!

45:08.434 --> 45:09.867
- I'll give her the money!
- No, no, no, no, no.

45:11.070 --> 45:12.094
Oh, shit.

45:12.204 --> 45:13.728
I'm here about a noise complaint!

45:15.641 --> 45:19.543
Someone called to complain
that you're not making enough noise!

45:24.917 --> 45:28.785
- This is the best party ever!
- This is the greatest party ever!

45:35.494 --> 45:38.554
I'm arrested! You guys, I'm arrested!

45:42.134 --> 45:43.123
Hey.

45:43.235 --> 45:46.227
Sorry. I was just trying to find some quiet

45:46.339 --> 45:49.866
- from the craziness out there.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm... Beer?

45:52.278 --> 45:53.336
Sure.

45:57.116 --> 45:59.516
Do you really think that I'm dumb enough
to cheat on you?

45:59.618 --> 46:01.051
I think it's only a matter of time,

46:01.153 --> 46:03.246
and, yeah, I think you're more
than dumb enough.

46:03.356 --> 46:05.221
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

46:05.324 --> 46:06.757
I appreciate that.

46:06.859 --> 46:09.726
This must be so hard for you.

46:12.198 --> 46:14.462
- What?
- Being in a relationship.

46:16.402 --> 46:19.633
Okay. I've been in relationships before,
all right?

46:19.939 --> 46:21.531
Oh, come on, Jack.

46:21.640 --> 46:24.302
I know you.
Don't forget, I have been living with you.

46:24.410 --> 46:28.744
You're not exactly serious
boyfriend/husband material, okay?

46:30.883 --> 46:33.545
- Well, this must be hard for you, too.
- Really?

46:33.652 --> 46:37.884
Yeah, being married to me when
you're so clearly in love with your ex.

46:41.894 --> 46:43.327
- I'm not in love with him.
- Right.

46:43.429 --> 46:44.896
Then why are you still wearing the ring
on your finger?

46:44.997 --> 46:47.227
Because my current husband
bought me one

46:47.333 --> 46:49.460
out of a vending machine in Vegas.

46:49.568 --> 46:52.469
All I know is, if I get dumped on my ass,

46:52.571 --> 46:54.801
I'm not wearing the ring
unless I'm still in love with him.

46:54.907 --> 46:56.932
- I'm not in love with him, okay?
- Okay! Right.

46:57.043 --> 46:58.908
In fact, I'm happy
I'm not with him anymore.

46:59.011 --> 47:00.535
I spent the last four years of my life

47:00.646 --> 47:03.114
trying to be
somebody else's idea of perfect,

47:03.215 --> 47:06.810
and you know what?
I still don't feel good enough for him.

47:12.558 --> 47:15.994
Okay, that's not what I meant, okay?
I just...

47:16.095 --> 47:19.360
Hey! Don't worry!
Your secret's safe with me.

47:19.465 --> 47:21.296
Oh, you're such an ass.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.833
You know what? It's irrelevant now,

47:22.935 --> 47:25.870
because I don't care
if I ever see him again.

47:31.610 --> 47:33.544
Wow. Thank you, baby.

47:33.646 --> 47:37.047
- That makes me feel so, so, so special.
- You know what? It has nothing

47:37.149 --> 47:39.208
- to do with you, Jack.
- By the way, don't worry about me,

47:39.318 --> 47:40.546
- because I'm a married man.
- Yeah.

47:40.653 --> 47:43.144
We don't need to have sex.
And I'll tell you another thing.

47:43.255 --> 47:46.520
I'm not going anywhere,
'cause I am not screwing this thing up.

47:46.625 --> 47:49.890
Neither am I,
'cause I am in it for the long haul, Jack.

47:49.995 --> 47:53.328
- Till death do us part.
- Not unless I kill you first.

48:04.510 --> 48:06.842
- It's like she's always there!
- He doesn't do anything all day, okay?

48:06.979 --> 48:09.038
- Left, right, up, down!
- It's like he's not even a grownup, okay?

48:09.148 --> 48:10.740
- I don't have an ounce of space...
- He does nothing...

48:10.850 --> 48:12.442
...for just me! Just me!
...all day long!

48:12.551 --> 48:15.076
- And I swear to God...
- I think he's trying to drive me crazy!

48:15.187 --> 48:16.984
- The other night, we had this party...
- He peed in the sink!

48:17.089 --> 48:19.649
...and everywhere I look...
- I mean, what kind of man animal...

48:19.758 --> 48:21.623
...it's just hot tit and ass everywhere!
...pees in the sink?

48:21.727 --> 48:23.957
- It's like he doesn't even want...
- It's like she doesn't even want...

48:24.063 --> 48:26.156
...this marriage to work!
...this marriage to work!

48:27.399 --> 48:30.425
All right. You're arguing.

48:30.536 --> 48:33.767
Now that felt like a real married couple.

48:33.873 --> 48:35.773
You're making progress.

48:40.679 --> 48:42.476
What am I doing here?

48:52.691 --> 48:55.387
Oh, we could kidnap her
until after the hearing.

48:55.494 --> 48:58.088
- She could stay at my place.
- Oh, my God, I got it!

48:58.197 --> 49:00.757
We make it look
like she gave you some kind of disease!

49:00.866 --> 49:03.232
I can have a vial of crabs here
in 30 minutes.

49:03.335 --> 49:04.495
First, we give them to you,

49:04.603 --> 49:06.628
and then, you know,
we get somebody to give them to her

49:06.739 --> 49:09.367
so it looks like she gave them to you.

49:10.943 --> 49:12.934
You really hadn't thought
that one through, had you?

49:13.045 --> 49:15.036
I'll give her the crabs, easily.

49:15.147 --> 49:17.843
- No more ideas from you.
- Oh, I've got it! It's perfect!

49:17.950 --> 49:19.417
This is great!

49:20.653 --> 49:21.642
Like that!

49:21.754 --> 49:22.982
- What are you doing?
- What?

49:23.088 --> 49:25.682
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Relax, relax, relax. Relax!

49:25.791 --> 49:27.850
Stay with me on this one.

49:28.561 --> 49:29.528
Huh?

49:30.362 --> 49:33.991
God damn it! No, you don't get it!
Dude, you don't get it!

49:51.250 --> 49:53.616
Jack, what happened to your face?

49:54.386 --> 49:56.513
- I fell.
- You fell?

49:57.523 --> 49:58.615
Yeah.

50:00.426 --> 50:02.485
I hit my head on a doorknob.

50:03.162 --> 50:04.629
A few times.

50:04.763 --> 50:06.754
I fall a lot these days. I'm just...

50:06.865 --> 50:08.423
I'm so clumsy.

50:08.534 --> 50:11.560
Jack, are you sure
that's what happened to you?

50:11.670 --> 50:14.400
Sure someone else didn't do this to you?

50:17.009 --> 50:18.476
I deserve it.

50:19.345 --> 50:20.835
I'm supposed...

50:22.114 --> 50:25.083
I'm supposed to line up the hand towels
just so, and I didn't...

50:25.184 --> 50:28.017
I didn't do it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.315
Then she said,
"You put that toilet seat down,

50:30.422 --> 50:31.980
"or I will put you down!"

50:36.929 --> 50:39.955
"I'll stick your head in there
and I will make it stay!" Oh, God!

50:40.099 --> 50:41.396
<i>...look real, but don't, like...
- All right.</i>

50:41.500 --> 50:43.400
<i>- Oh, God!
- What?</i>

50:44.003 --> 50:46.471
<i>He's gotta make it look real
so it seems like she was beating you!</i>

50:46.572 --> 50:48.039
<i>Not that real!</i>

50:49.675 --> 50:51.836
<i>- Yeah!
- That sucker's gonna show, dude!</i>

50:51.944 --> 50:53.275
<i>Hey, come on. Come on.</i>

50:53.379 --> 50:55.006
Can we get back to therapy now?

50:58.217 --> 50:59.275
Yes.

51:00.219 --> 51:01.584
Yes, we can.

51:12.931 --> 51:14.421
<i>Hi, you've reached the happy couple.</i>

51:14.533 --> 51:16.364
<i>We can't come to the phone right now</i>

51:16.468 --> 51:17.765
<i>because we're busy loving each other.</i>

51:17.870 --> 51:19.428
<i>And making our marriage work.</i>

51:19.538 --> 51:21.267
<i>- Leave a message!
- Leave a message!</i>

51:21.373 --> 51:22.567
<i>Hi. This is Annette calling</i>

51:22.675 --> 51:24.700
<i>from Dr. Twitchell's office.</i>

51:24.810 --> 51:26.141
Hello.

51:26.245 --> 51:28.213
<i>- Yes, Mrs. Fuller?
- Yes.</i>

51:28.547 --> 51:30.447
The doctor needed
to cancel today's session,

51:30.549 --> 51:32.517
and she was wondering
if you could do Friday?

51:32.618 --> 51:35.018
Do you have anything
after 3:00 p.m., possibly?

51:35.120 --> 51:38.521
<i>- The doctor can do 4:00.
- Oh, perfect.</i>

51:38.624 --> 51:40.251
<i>- That works for me.
- We'll see you then.</i>

51:40.359 --> 51:42.953
<i>- Great, see you then.
- Thanks so much.</i>

51:43.595 --> 51:46.564
- She totally bought it.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.

51:47.499 --> 51:49.399
- Beautiful.
- You owe me.

51:51.637 --> 51:55.630
<i>Come on with your come on
You don't fight fair</i>

51:55.741 --> 51:58.801
<i>That's okay, see if I care</i>

51:58.911 --> 52:02.039
<i>Blah, blah, blah, blah...</i>

52:02.147 --> 52:04.581
<i>Hit me with your best shot</i>

52:04.683 --> 52:06.674
<i>Fire away</i>

52:11.657 --> 52:13.215
Hello?

52:13.325 --> 52:14.383
Jack?

52:18.163 --> 52:19.221
Taxi!

52:20.432 --> 52:23.026
Come on, man! Hey!

52:26.105 --> 52:28.335
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Wait a minute.

52:28.974 --> 52:30.134
Oh, come on!

52:32.978 --> 52:35.208
Twitchell... Twitchell...

52:37.649 --> 52:39.082
<i>Dr. Twitchell speaking.</i>

52:39.184 --> 52:41.744
<i>- Yes, hi, this is Joy Fuller.
- Mrs. Fuller.</i>

52:41.854 --> 52:44.448
Yes. I got a phone call from Annette

52:44.556 --> 52:46.547
saying that our session
was canceled today.

52:46.658 --> 52:50.094
<i>- I just wanted to double-check that.
- Your session is definitely still on.</i>

52:50.195 --> 52:53.130
<i>And any absence
is considered contempt of court.</i>

52:53.232 --> 52:54.199
It is?

52:56.034 --> 52:58.798
Asshole! Trying to get me
to miss therapy!

52:59.605 --> 53:02.096
75th and Riverside, and step on it!

53:04.676 --> 53:05.768
Okay.

53:09.214 --> 53:10.977
- What?
- Hey!

53:11.083 --> 53:13.517
Good luck paying for that cab
without your wallet.

53:15.287 --> 53:17.084
Only five dollars?

53:17.189 --> 53:18.781
You stole my wallet?

53:20.559 --> 53:22.959
Lost your wallet, huh? Get out.

53:24.596 --> 53:26.291
Come on. What do you want?
We can work something out here.

53:26.398 --> 53:28.093
- Show me your breasts.
- What?

53:28.200 --> 53:30.930
You'd be surprised how often it happens.

53:32.438 --> 53:35.635
- Okay, one breast. That's all you get.
- All right.

53:39.745 --> 53:42.213
- Nothing like a nice boob.
- What is your problem?

53:42.314 --> 53:44.475
What? I like breasts. Sue me.

53:44.983 --> 53:46.177
Is there any way around this?

53:46.285 --> 53:49.220
Does it look
like there is a way around this?

53:52.658 --> 53:53.955
<i>Go!</i>

53:54.726 --> 53:56.887
<i>so 1, 2, 3, take my hand and come with me</i>

53:56.995 --> 53:59.623
<i>Because you look so fine
And I really wanna make you mine</i>

54:00.098 --> 54:01.963
- How many for 10 of these?
- Ten for $2.

54:02.067 --> 54:04.228
- Okay. Here, take five.
- Okay.

54:04.336 --> 54:06.600
<i>Now you don't need that money
when you look like that, do ya honey</i>

54:11.243 --> 54:15.009
<i>I know we
ain't got much to say</i>

54:15.781 --> 54:19.740
<i>Before I let you get away, yeah!</i>

54:22.154 --> 54:26.250
There's Brooklyn.
Very exciting. Everyone, back on the bus!

54:26.358 --> 54:27.382
What a day, huh?

54:35.467 --> 54:37.298
Is this seat taken?

54:38.437 --> 54:41.065
Pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

54:41.173 --> 54:43.505
- You are so immature!
- Please, woman!

54:44.276 --> 54:45.538
Go away!

54:45.644 --> 54:48.044
- That really hurt!
- Oh, no! You're hurting me!

54:48.547 --> 54:50.845
And here we are,
Central Park.

54:50.949 --> 54:52.416
Yes, isn't it beautiful?

54:52.518 --> 54:56.818
Half an hour, people. That's 30 minutes
for those on the metric system.

55:00.158 --> 55:02.126
I'll take that! You mind?

55:04.897 --> 55:05.886
- What?
- Thank you!

55:05.998 --> 55:07.090
Hey!

55:08.767 --> 55:12.294
<i>Well I could see
you home with me</i>

55:13.038 --> 55:16.997
<i>But you were with another man, yeah!</i>

55:17.576 --> 55:20.670
<i>I know we
ain't got much to say</i>

55:20.779 --> 55:21.905
Idiot!

55:22.247 --> 55:26.115
<i>Before I let you get away, yeah!</i>

55:30.789 --> 55:33.189
<i>I said are you gonna be my girl?</i>

55:56.515 --> 55:58.210
No, you're wrong.
You can't remember anything.

55:58.317 --> 56:00.410
You're remembering
your first date with somebody else!

56:00.519 --> 56:02.009
No! It was not our first date!

56:02.120 --> 56:05.248
You keep thinking that. You always did.
You are demented!

56:05.524 --> 56:06.786
It was not!
- It was!

56:06.892 --> 56:07.859
Your memory...

56:07.960 --> 56:09.325
Mine?
You can't remember the date!

56:09.428 --> 56:11.020
Yes, it's your...

56:11.430 --> 56:13.364
Hi, honey! Welcome home!

56:13.732 --> 56:15.063
Mom! Dad!

56:17.102 --> 56:18.433
What are you doing here?

56:18.537 --> 56:20.232
Well, I got a message from your parents,

56:20.339 --> 56:24.207
and I thought I'd surprise you
and invite them over for dinner.

56:26.812 --> 56:28.780
You know that I've never
been invited over here?

56:28.880 --> 56:30.871
No! Really?

56:31.249 --> 56:32.648
Why didn't you tell us
you got married?

56:32.751 --> 56:34.685
I know you're still mad at me
about the firing,

56:34.786 --> 56:37.050
but you get married and you don't tell us?

56:37.155 --> 56:39.282
That is very, very hurtful.

56:39.658 --> 56:40.716
- Especially...
- Dad, I...

56:40.826 --> 56:43.954
Especially when it's a catch like Joy here.

56:44.463 --> 56:45.657
- What?
- Well...

56:45.764 --> 56:48.028
We're so proud of you, Jack!

56:49.067 --> 56:50.762
We didn't think you'd ever settle down.

56:50.869 --> 56:54.930
But then we met this wonderful girl.
You couldn't have done better!

56:55.440 --> 56:56.839
We are very proud of you, Son.

56:56.942 --> 56:59.376
- Okay. Love biscuit?
- Yes, tinkle monkey?

56:59.478 --> 57:01.844
Can I speak to you for one second?

57:01.947 --> 57:03.244
Of course!

57:03.348 --> 57:05.145
He probably just wants
to give me a big smooch.

57:05.250 --> 57:06.444
We haven't seen each other all day!

57:07.819 --> 57:11.414
My God!
How weird is it going to be in court

57:11.556 --> 57:14.525
when your parents are
character witnesses for me?

57:14.626 --> 57:16.753
Well, obviously, you haven't
told them everything.

57:16.862 --> 57:18.989
No, I was waiting for you to do that.

57:19.097 --> 57:20.724
What if we didn't?

57:22.401 --> 57:27.202
What would it take for you to just
keep this our little secret for a little bit?

57:28.674 --> 57:30.733
I want the bathroom door back.

57:30.842 --> 57:34.107
And I want the toilet seat left the F down.

57:34.346 --> 57:35.335
No.

57:35.647 --> 57:37.478
- One time up...
- I got it.

57:37.582 --> 57:38.810
...and I make the call.

57:38.917 --> 57:40.077
- Done.
- Okay.

57:40.185 --> 57:43.552
Well, Jack, Sr., you know, it is just so nice

57:43.655 --> 57:47.284
to finally meet the man
who has taught Jack everything he knows.

57:47.392 --> 57:49.417
- I tried.
- Well, something must've stuck.

57:49.528 --> 57:51.257
Do you know he made this bar
we're sitting at?

57:51.363 --> 57:53.729
Isn't it beautiful? I mean, look.

57:53.999 --> 57:56.160
Dovetail's off on the corner.

57:57.335 --> 57:58.563
It's off!

57:59.671 --> 58:01.639
Well, I think it's great.

58:02.340 --> 58:04.865
I actually think that Jack
could sell his furniture.

58:04.976 --> 58:07.342
I don't know.
That would require actually finishing it.

58:07.446 --> 58:09.812
Maybe you should try telling Jack
you don't want him to finish it,

58:09.915 --> 58:12.383
then maybe he would actually do it.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.844
What are you doing on Saturday?

58:16.955 --> 58:19.446
You've got to come to Uncle Pat's
birthday in the park with us.

58:19.558 --> 58:21.116
I would love to.

58:22.194 --> 58:23.889
She went after my family!

58:23.995 --> 58:26.054
Dude, you're letting this chick
get in your head.

58:26.164 --> 58:27.597
Yeah, I know.

58:28.900 --> 58:31.460
Now I'm going to figure out
how to get into hers.

58:31.570 --> 58:33.435
You should never let a chick
get in your head.

58:33.538 --> 58:36.632
That's why I prefer
not to even talk to my dates.

58:41.980 --> 58:43.004
Yes!

58:44.316 --> 58:47.308
Why didn't I think of this before?
If she's going to play dirty, so am I.

58:51.757 --> 58:54.055
- Hi.
- Hey. Jameson, on the rocks.

59:00.332 --> 59:02.391
- You're Mason, right?
- Yeah.

59:02.667 --> 59:05.329
I'm Jack Fuller. I'm a friend of Joy's.

59:05.704 --> 59:06.671
- Joy's?
- Yeah.

59:06.772 --> 59:09.263
I just wanted to give you this back.

59:10.242 --> 59:11.709
She threw it in the trash.

59:11.810 --> 59:14.404
But, you know, guy code, I couldn't just
let it end up in the trash.

59:14.513 --> 59:16.572
I mean, you spent, what, like,
five, six thousand on this thing.

59:16.681 --> 59:18.546
Actually, thirty grand.

59:20.285 --> 59:21.513
I got it.

59:23.021 --> 59:24.955
All right. Well, thanks.

59:26.491 --> 59:27.549
Okay.

59:31.930 --> 59:33.693
Hey, how's she doing?

59:37.102 --> 59:38.364
You know, she's good.

59:38.470 --> 59:40.370
She's probably put on some weight,
though, right?

59:40.472 --> 59:42.337
From all the emotional eating
due to the break-up?

59:42.440 --> 59:44.567
You really lived up to the billing.
You know that?

59:44.676 --> 59:47.042
Joy told me
what an impressive guy you are.

59:47.145 --> 59:48.203
Oh! Yeah.

59:48.313 --> 59:51.441
She said she was trying to be
so perfect, because

59:52.217 --> 59:56.620
deep down, she never really felt
like she was good enough to be with you.

59:57.222 --> 59:59.918
But those insecurities are long gone now.

01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:03.027
She's really come into her own.
She's on fire!

01:00:03.128 --> 01:00:05.858
I'll tell you what, she not gonna be
on the open market for very long.

01:00:05.964 --> 01:00:08.455
- It's a feeding frenzy out there!
- A feeding frenzy, huh? Yeah.

01:00:08.567 --> 01:00:10.501
Well, I gotta get going.

01:00:11.203 --> 01:00:14.400
My Uncle Pat is having a birthday party
tomorrow in Grove Park.

01:00:14.506 --> 01:00:15.598
Joy and I are going.

01:00:15.707 --> 01:00:19.143
Anyway, I gotta go pick up the present
she got for him. Bag of weed!

01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:20.677
- Her idea!
- Really?

01:00:20.812 --> 01:00:22.473
- She's on fire!
- Wow.

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:23.775
On fire.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:27.345
Well, thanks again.

01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:34.824
Stripper! Hiya!

01:00:34.993 --> 01:00:37.928
- I so want to junkpunch that guy.
- What's with you and junkpunching?

01:00:38.196 --> 01:00:40.061
- Joy?
- Hi!

01:00:40.165 --> 01:00:42.360
I'm so glad you could make it.
Hey, sweetie.

01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:46.028
- Hi! This is my girlfriend, Tipper.
- Hi, Tipper. Judy.

01:00:46.805 --> 01:00:48.136
- Thanks for calling.
- Where's Jack?

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.107
He's over there,
coaching the Little League.

01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:54.711
<i>Do you know what it's like
to fall on the floor?</i>

01:00:54.813 --> 01:00:57.338
<i>And cry your guts out till you got no more</i>

01:00:57.449 --> 01:00:59.474
Come on, sweetheart.
I want my new daughter-in-law

01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:02.144
- to meet the whole family.
- Smile!

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.514
One, two, three,

01:01:03.622 --> 01:01:04.646
- Rockets!
- Rockets!

01:01:04.756 --> 01:01:06.781
Who wants sugar? Let's go!

01:01:07.158 --> 01:01:09.752
What is this, like a five-foot hoagie?

01:01:10.729 --> 01:01:11.718
- Hi!
- Hi.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:16.199
This is my niece, and BFF,
the great Sammy Sosa.

01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:20.795
Sammy, this is your Aunt Joy.

01:01:20.906 --> 01:01:22.897
- Nice to meet you, Sammy.
- Hi, Joy.

01:01:23.008 --> 01:01:24.635
I didn't know you coached Little League.

01:01:24.743 --> 01:01:27.735
Oh, there's a lot of things you don't know
about me. Isn't that right?

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:32.374
Jack wore a little fedora
and a leather jacket to school

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:33.951
every day for six months.

01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:36.646
Who wouldn't want to be Indiana Jones?

01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:38.282
I agree completely. I mean,

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:42.349
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark may be
the greatest movie ever made.</i>

01:01:46.531 --> 01:01:50.763
- I don't think I like what's going on here.
- What, are we bonding now?

01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:53.595
She doesn't seem so bad, Uncle Jack.

01:01:54.072 --> 01:01:57.132
I think you guys should just
split the money and stay married.

01:01:57.442 --> 01:01:59.637
Make a hundred pretty babies.

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:02.946
You told her?

01:02:03.148 --> 01:02:06.675
Yeah, I don't have secrets from Sammy.
I tell her everything.

01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:10.243
<i>Hey man now you're really living</i>

01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:16.288
<i>Well I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill</i>

01:02:16.861 --> 01:02:19.921
<i>But hey man now you're really living</i>

01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:23.831
Well, ladies, I believe
this is where we go our separate ways.

01:02:24.135 --> 01:02:25.602
Thank you.

01:02:29.174 --> 01:02:32.041
<i>People sing</i>

01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:34.873
<i>Do you know what it's like
to fall on the floor?</i>

01:02:35.113 --> 01:02:37.741
<i>And cry your guts out till you got no more</i>

01:02:38.116 --> 01:02:40.880
<i>Hey man now you're really living</i>

01:02:41.019 --> 01:02:42.179
Joy!

01:02:42.587 --> 01:02:43.815
Mason.

01:02:44.222 --> 01:02:47.020
- What are you doing here?
- I was just visiting some friends.

01:02:47.125 --> 01:02:49.719
- In Brooklyn?
- Well, yeah. Yeah.

01:02:49.828 --> 01:02:52.262
Brooklyn. The B.K. Love it here.

01:02:52.364 --> 01:02:53.922
Yeah, they're artists. Yeah.

01:02:54.032 --> 01:02:56.762
Hey, you want to go grab a glass of vino?
Maybe chat up for a bit?

01:02:56.901 --> 01:03:00.860
I can't right now. Sorry.

01:03:00.972 --> 01:03:04.965
- Okay, all right. Well, maybe next week.
- I have my retreat.

01:03:06.344 --> 01:03:07.402
Wow!

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.907
You seem fine.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:15.945
No, I mean, you look great.
Doesn't she look great? You look great.

01:03:16.287 --> 01:03:17.754
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:19.723
I... Yeah.

01:03:21.259 --> 01:03:23.386
- I gotta go.
- Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

01:03:23.595 --> 01:03:26.325
- All right, well, maybe some other time.
- Yeah.

01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:28.160
Good seeing you.
Good bumping into you like that. Weird.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.597
Take care.

01:03:36.341 --> 01:03:38.468
- Oh, my God. You're falling for her.
- What?

01:03:38.676 --> 01:03:41.611
- You're falling for your wife! You idiot!
- What are you talking about?

01:03:41.713 --> 01:03:44.307
- She's a wily temptress.
- "A wily temptress."

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:45.815
- Yes!
- You just said "wily temptress."

01:03:45.917 --> 01:03:47.748
Yes, I did, because that is what she is.

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:50.651
And what do wily temptresses do, Jack?

01:03:50.855 --> 01:03:54.848
They tempt in a wily fashion.
And then they play you.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.724
Tempt, play, tempt, play.
And she's playing you, my friend.

01:03:59.831 --> 01:04:02.994
Don't let her play you
out of what is rightfully yours.

01:04:03.101 --> 01:04:07.128
Keep your eyes on the prize, Jack!
Eyes on the prize.

01:04:16.247 --> 01:04:19.216
Hey, McNally.
What'd you do, take the weekend off?

01:04:19.317 --> 01:04:20.409
- Oh...
- Have fun?

01:04:20.518 --> 01:04:22.679
No, I remember when I didn't care
about my career, either.

01:04:22.787 --> 01:04:26.746
I'm sorry, I just had this thing
this weekend with my husband's family...

01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:28.655
Your husband? You got married?

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:30.988
Well, thanks for the invite.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.

01:04:31.196 --> 01:04:33.391
Yeah, no, I'm married.
I didn't tell you that?

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:36.500
No, you didn't.
I guess you're not a big sharer.

01:04:36.601 --> 01:04:38.796
Now, listen, Joy,
I've been in this business for a long time.

01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:41.963
And the thing that I value most
in my employees is honesty.

01:04:42.107 --> 01:04:45.543
So I'm gonna be honest with you.
Right now, you and Chong are tied.

01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:48.544
Now, Chonger is bringing her husband
to the retreat.

01:04:48.646 --> 01:04:52.138
- I think you should bring yours, too.
- He will be there.

01:04:53.017 --> 01:04:55.315
- You can count on it, sir.
- Good.

01:04:59.324 --> 01:05:00.518
So let me get this straight.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:04.186
She asked you
to come to a retreat for her job.

01:05:04.295 --> 01:05:05.592
Yeah.

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:08.598
The most important thing
to her in the world.

01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:12.361
Do you believe that? I was like, "No!"

01:05:14.405 --> 01:05:20.241
'Cause I'm like... I'm like,
"Hey, what are you still doing here?"

01:05:21.146 --> 01:05:24.081
Jack! You have got
to get your ass down there,

01:05:24.182 --> 01:05:26.810
pretend to be the perfect husband,
charm them all, and then,

01:05:26.918 --> 01:05:29.682
when you have them eating
out of the palm of your hand,

01:05:29.787 --> 01:05:31.652
you make her sign this.

01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:35.321
- What's this?
- This is a document, okay,

01:05:36.161 --> 01:05:38.925
relinquishing all the rights to the money.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:44.595
Right? You tell her if she doesn't sign it,
you're gonna out her in front of everybody.

01:05:47.071 --> 01:05:48.129
Yeah.

01:05:50.108 --> 01:05:51.598
I mean, that's not, you know...

01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:53.802
It's not pretty, but we can...

01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:56.072
I can laminate it.

01:05:59.684 --> 01:06:03.552
- I don't know.
- Okay, look, Jack, the hearing's in a week.

01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:05.748
Okay? This is our last shot.

01:06:26.611 --> 01:06:28.704
- Hey, McNally.
- Mr. Banger.

01:06:29.113 --> 01:06:30.341
So, where's this husband of yours?

01:06:30.448 --> 01:06:33.246
I just met Chonger's husband.
He's a very smart guy.

01:06:33.351 --> 01:06:35.410
He's a tool, but he's smart.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.251
He's...

01:06:39.557 --> 01:06:43.220
So the spaceman says,
"I don't even have a vagina!"

01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:44.659
He's there!

01:06:46.297 --> 01:06:48.356
I'll just take this to him.

01:06:50.735 --> 01:06:52.635
Mr. Banger, I just wanted
to take this moment

01:06:52.737 --> 01:06:55.228
to express to you my gratitude.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:58.471
I'll be seeing you at the...

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:00.036
The dining table.

01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:02.077
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:05.805
I'm so glad to see you.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:07.578
Muffin, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:07:07.685 --> 01:07:11.086
This is why everyone
should have their wife on LoJack.

01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:14.625
Let me introduce you to my friends.
This is David Young, your CFO.

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:16.694
Mr. Young. An honor. Hi.

01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:19.452
And this is the rest of your board, actually.

01:07:19.764 --> 01:07:22.665
Great people. Wealthy people.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:07:24.936 --> 01:07:26.403
So you're the lucky guy.

01:07:26.504 --> 01:07:29.064
- Hi. Jack Fuller.
- I'm Richard Banger.

01:07:30.108 --> 01:07:31.769
You're in my seat.

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.310
Wait, your name is Richard Banger?

01:07:35.813 --> 01:07:37.781
Your name is Dick Banger.

01:07:37.949 --> 01:07:39.712
Dick Banger! Dick Banger?

01:07:39.884 --> 01:07:43.843
You, sir, have just provided us with jokes
for the whole weekend!

01:07:47.058 --> 01:07:50.585
Well, you must be Jack... off!

01:07:50.695 --> 01:07:52.424
Jack-Off! Give it to me, baby!

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:54.691
- Jack-Off, buddy!
- He has a comeback!

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.534
McNally, where have you
been hiding this guy?

01:07:57.635 --> 01:07:59.432
You know, I've just been
keeping him all to myself!

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:00.799
Well, you gotta learn how to share.

01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:05.034
All right, everybody, let's sit down.
Brainiac, Chonger, move over.

01:08:05.743 --> 01:08:09.110
"Jack-Off." How about it? Oh, boy.

01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:13.445
I don't know what made you change
your mind, and I don't need to. I just...

01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:14.848
Thank you.

01:08:17.889 --> 01:08:20.790
- "Jack-Off." I love that.
- Yeah, I do, too.

01:08:24.429 --> 01:08:27.956
I love that, that you said that.
Because it was...

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:30.863
For a moment there, I...

01:08:30.968 --> 01:08:32.265
I'm so sorry.

01:08:33.104 --> 01:08:34.765
Joy, come on over! Joy!

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.604
I'm on it!

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:40.770
- Yeah!
- I'm on it.

01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:45.207
Yeah! Yeah!

01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:53.020
<i>One looks for happiness
One longs to find a partner</i>

01:08:53.157 --> 01:08:57.059
<i>One knows that nowadays
One love will be the answer</i>

01:08:58.863 --> 01:09:01.491
<i>One sees a crazy world
One needs a fresh perspective</i>

01:09:01.599 --> 01:09:03.260
- Hey.
- So what's up? She sign it yet?

01:09:03.368 --> 01:09:04.493
No, not yet.

01:09:04.602 --> 01:09:05.660
<i>You better not
be pussying out on me!</i>

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.398
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
I'm just waiting for her to get down here.

01:09:08.639 --> 01:09:10.470
<i>Got to warm
these people up, you know?</i>

01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:12.701
All right, well, call me
when it's done, okay?

01:09:12.810 --> 01:09:14.004
I'm holding down the fort in the meantime.

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:15.100
<i>- Yeah. All right.
- Bye.</i>

01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:20.345
Lavender.

01:09:21.586 --> 01:09:23.281
You get on my head.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:30.859
Oh, my God. That is slick.
That is something else.

01:10:05.296 --> 01:10:07.662
- Can you believe this?
- No.

01:10:09.867 --> 01:10:13.268
I guess I was wrong.
You do clean up pretty well.

01:10:17.408 --> 01:10:18.500
What?

01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:22.045
No, you just... You...

01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:24.872
I like your hair like that.

01:10:25.883 --> 01:10:27.043
Thanks.

01:10:27.652 --> 01:10:29.415
Can I get two shots?

01:10:29.854 --> 01:10:31.617
You know what? Make it three.

01:10:31.722 --> 01:10:34.190
Hello, McNally.
Jack-Off, how are you doing?

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.854
- Hey, Mr. Banger.
- How are you?

01:10:36.961 --> 01:10:37.985
Good.

01:10:38.496 --> 01:10:39.656
Cheers.

01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:45.895
"Hello, my name is Joy's Bitch."

01:10:48.372 --> 01:10:51.273
How's it going tonight?
You guys having fun?

01:10:52.443 --> 01:10:55.503
That's a good one, McNally.
I had no idea you were so much fun.

01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:56.807
She's very serious at work.

01:10:56.914 --> 01:10:59.246
You don't know her that well.
This one's a wildcat.

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:03.377
- I wouldn't lie to you, Big Dick.
- Well, if you did, I'd have to kill you.

01:11:03.488 --> 01:11:05.615
- Seriously.
- There's nothing this woman loves

01:11:05.723 --> 01:11:06.985
- more than a good dare.
- Really?

01:11:07.091 --> 01:11:08.922
Yeah. You ever see what she can do
with a champagne bottle?

01:11:09.026 --> 01:11:12.484
- Unbelievable. Shocking.
- No, it's just... It's a party trick. It's not...

01:11:12.597 --> 01:11:13.928
I dare you.

01:11:20.738 --> 01:11:22.706
- I hate you.
- You love me.

01:11:25.676 --> 01:11:27.735
Very good! Very good!

01:11:27.845 --> 01:11:30.712
Terrific! You know,
had I seen this side of you before,

01:11:30.815 --> 01:11:34.046
I probably would have promoted you
a long time ago.

01:11:38.322 --> 01:11:40.222
<i>Get down on it</i>

01:11:40.858 --> 01:11:42.826
- That's a lot.
- Your turn.

01:11:47.398 --> 01:11:49.491
You know what? You shouldn't do that.

01:11:50.568 --> 01:11:52.399
You've got this, okay?

01:11:53.471 --> 01:11:54.995
Throw the dice.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.498
You've got this.

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:01.237
- We need what, a seven?
- A seven!

01:12:01.379 --> 01:12:03.142
- Okay.
- Throw a seven!

01:12:05.917 --> 01:12:07.043
Seven.

01:12:07.151 --> 01:12:08.516
Oh, my God!

01:12:08.853 --> 01:12:10.684
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:13.052
We're done. Can we quit?
Can we quit? We're... Okay.

01:12:13.157 --> 01:12:14.283
Throw it in there.

01:12:14.392 --> 01:12:17.987
<i>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please gather round?</i>

01:12:19.163 --> 01:12:23.497
<i>Come on. Don't be afraid.
This year's Golden Handshake Award</i>

01:12:23.601 --> 01:12:26.900
<i>for best team spirit goes to a new face,</i>

01:12:27.572 --> 01:12:31.804
<i>and one of the funniest son of a bitches
I've ever had the pleasure to know.</i>

01:12:31.909 --> 01:12:34.070
<i>And I think you know
who I'm talking about.</i>

01:12:34.211 --> 01:12:39.274
- Jack-Off! Jack-Off! Jack-Off!
- Jack-Off! Jack-Off! Jack-Off!

01:12:39.383 --> 01:12:41.374
<i>Get up here! Come on!</i>

01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:45.352
<i>Congratulations, Jack-Off.</i>

01:12:47.325 --> 01:12:50.522
<i>Well, thank you all
for an amazing weekend. I...</i>

01:12:52.763 --> 01:12:54.924
<i>I have to thank my wife, Joy.</i>

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:03.734
<i>she probably never told you all
the story about how we met.</i>

01:13:09.313 --> 01:13:12.339
<i>It might come as a surprise
to many of you</i>

01:13:13.084 --> 01:13:17.180
<i>that we didn't know each other
for very long before we got hitched.</i>

01:13:24.028 --> 01:13:26.690
<i>What can I say? You know?
When you know, you know.</i>

01:13:28.799 --> 01:13:33.031
<i>On our wedding night, we were so busy
running back to the honeymoon suite</i>

01:13:33.137 --> 01:13:37.767
<i>that we never really got a chance
to have a first dance.</i>

01:13:38.442 --> 01:13:39.500
<i>so...</i>

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.977
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:13:44.081 --> 01:13:47.244
<i>for the first time,
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Fuller!</i>

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:57.454
<i>First, when there's nothing</i>

01:13:58.329 --> 01:14:02.095
<i>but a slow glowing dream</i>

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.625
<i>That your fear seems to hide...</i>

01:14:06.837 --> 01:14:08.532
You hear that?

01:14:08.639 --> 01:14:11.733
- They're clinking.
- Yeah. They are clinking.

01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:15.306
I think that means they want us to kiss.

01:14:15.546 --> 01:14:18.242
Well, if that's what the crowd wants...

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:22.416
Yeah, but if you're not up for it,
you don't have to. It's fine.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.388
<i>In a world made of steel</i>

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:30.153
<i>Made of stone</i>

01:14:34.298 --> 01:14:37.734
<i>Well, I hear the music</i>

01:14:37.835 --> 01:14:41.566
<i>Close my eyes, feel the rhythm</i>

01:14:42.006 --> 01:14:43.769
<i>Wrap around</i>

01:14:43.874 --> 01:14:48.709
<i>Take a hold of my heart</i>

01:14:49.513 --> 01:14:51.174
<i>What a feeling!</i>

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.914
<i>Being's believing</i>

01:14:57.021 --> 01:15:03.426
<i>I can't have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life</i>

01:15:04.695 --> 01:15:06.526
<i>Take your passion</i>

01:15:08.065 --> 01:15:11.228
<i>And make it happen</i>

01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:23.906
All right, look.

01:15:24.482 --> 01:15:27.610
When's the last time
you were, like, really happy?

01:15:27.718 --> 01:15:29.686
- Really happy?
- And don't say Vegas,

01:15:29.787 --> 01:15:33.120
because if you do, I'll just... I'll have to cry.

01:15:35.059 --> 01:15:36.117
Okay.

01:15:37.928 --> 01:15:39.793
There was this one day,

01:15:40.798 --> 01:15:43.198
before the Exchange, before Mason.

01:15:45.035 --> 01:15:49.062
I was feeling really adventurous,
so I took the ferry

01:15:49.173 --> 01:15:51.971
- about 30 miles east of the city.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:52.576 --> 01:15:54.305
There was this great lighthouse.

01:15:54.411 --> 01:15:58.006
I mean, it was just right on the beach,
off the boardwalk.

01:15:58.449 --> 01:16:00.440
- You went there by yourself?
- Yeah.

01:16:00.551 --> 01:16:03.281
You know, I just, like, sat on the beach,

01:16:04.388 --> 01:16:07.721
listened to the waves,
watched the sunset.

01:16:09.326 --> 01:16:13.786
God! I had no concerns, you know?
I had, like, no responsibilities,

01:16:13.898 --> 01:16:15.661
no job stressing me out.

01:16:15.766 --> 01:16:18.826
I had no one to please but myself.

01:16:19.904 --> 01:16:22.304
- That's that photo you have.
- Yeah.

01:16:23.641 --> 01:16:26.610
That was a great day.

01:16:43.894 --> 01:16:46.294
I did take myself out of the game.

01:16:52.236 --> 01:16:54.261
If you stop betting,

01:16:55.372 --> 01:16:57.237
you never have to lose.

01:17:10.688 --> 01:17:12.451
I'd bet on you, Jack.

01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:29.095
So, long day, huh?

01:17:29.707 --> 01:17:31.038
Yeah.

01:17:33.944 --> 01:17:36.811
So, we should probably get to bed.

01:17:38.949 --> 01:17:39.973
Yep.

01:18:00.004 --> 01:18:02.302
Can you undo my zipper?

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.807
- It gets stuck.
- Yeah! Yeah.

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.041
Absolutely.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.547
All right.

01:18:28.432 --> 01:18:30.593
All right. Okay. There it is.

01:18:35.572 --> 01:18:36.732
Thanks.

01:19:05.336 --> 01:19:07.531
Hey, I... These...

01:19:07.638 --> 01:19:11.199
- I wasn't in your things.
- It's okay. Just leave them right there.

01:19:11.308 --> 01:19:13.037
I can put them back.

01:19:19.049 --> 01:19:20.880
Good night, Mr. Fuller.

01:19:21.485 --> 01:19:23.350
Good night, Mrs. Fuller.

01:19:53.817 --> 01:19:55.114
<i>It's all right</i>

01:19:57.654 --> 01:19:58.621
<i>It's all right</i>

01:20:00.224 --> 01:20:01.555
<i>Everything's all right</i>

01:20:05.195 --> 01:20:06.389
<i>It's all right</i>

01:20:07.898 --> 01:20:09.763
<i>Everything's all right</i>

01:20:16.607 --> 01:20:17.574
<i>It's okay</i>

01:20:19.810 --> 01:20:23.007
Okay, I'm on my way. I know.

01:20:23.147 --> 01:20:24.614
It's almost over.
I'm about to be a free woman.

01:20:24.715 --> 01:20:27.309
- Joy. Joy!
- What?

01:20:28.619 --> 01:20:30.052
I have to go.

01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:31.854
- Mason?
- Yeah.

01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:37.692
I can't talk right now. I'm sorry.
I have to get going. I just...

01:20:37.795 --> 01:20:39.558
I want you back, Joy.

01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:43.895
- What?
- I made a huge mistake letting you go.

01:20:44.001 --> 01:20:45.593
I see that now.

01:20:45.736 --> 01:20:48.933
Seeing you the other day,
you had this glow about you.

01:20:49.039 --> 01:20:51.735
Not that you didn't before, it's just...

01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:53.968
Sometimes it takes losing something

01:20:54.078 --> 01:20:56.376
for you to realize what you had.

01:20:57.114 --> 01:21:00.015
I want to make up
for the wrong I did to you.

01:21:01.518 --> 01:21:02.985
This is yours.

01:21:03.654 --> 01:21:06.521
I gave it to you, and I want you to have it.

01:21:08.725 --> 01:21:11.091
- Where did you get this?
- And Joy,

01:21:12.863 --> 01:21:15.024
you are good enough for me.

01:21:27.277 --> 01:21:28.505
I mean that!

01:21:45.129 --> 01:21:47.120
Court is called to order.

01:21:47.998 --> 01:21:51.024
Well, lookie here, lookie here!
The happy couple!

01:21:51.135 --> 01:21:54.832
Six months down the road.
Did you learn anything?

01:21:55.472 --> 01:21:56.496
We'll see.

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.701
Now, Dr. Twitchell, in your opinion,
did the couple,

01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:01.835
Jack Fuller and Joy McNally,

01:22:01.945 --> 01:22:04.607
obey the court order
to live together as man and wife,

01:22:04.715 --> 01:22:08.116
and do you believe they put
sufficient effort into the marriage?

01:22:13.157 --> 01:22:14.624
These two have

01:22:17.594 --> 01:22:19.152
a lot of issues.

01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:23.191
A lot of deeply unsettling issues

01:22:23.667 --> 01:22:27.000
that, as individuals,
they seriously need to work on.

01:22:28.038 --> 01:22:29.335
Seriously.

01:22:30.908 --> 01:22:33.706
But together, in my honest opinion,

01:22:35.145 --> 01:22:37.409
they're perfect for each other.

01:22:38.015 --> 01:22:39.243
It's the real thing.

01:22:40.217 --> 01:22:41.514
Go figure.

01:22:43.253 --> 01:22:46.086
Well, thank you, Doctor.
You may step down.

01:22:48.959 --> 01:22:50.221
Tipper!

01:22:57.434 --> 01:22:58.992
Hi, Your Honor.

01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:01.428
Have you lost weight?

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.269
Gotcha. Let's begin.

01:23:05.909 --> 01:23:10.972
Although Ms. McNally ran up $25,000
in credit card debt in my client's name,

01:23:11.081 --> 01:23:13.743
my client recently spent the same amount

01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.751
for materials
for his new furniture business.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.146
Therefore, we propose
the following settlement, Your Honor.

01:23:20.424 --> 01:23:22.790
The original $3 million,
deduct half for taxes

01:23:22.893 --> 01:23:25.623
and $50,000 that's already been spent,

01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:28.664
that leaves $1.45 million to be divided...

01:23:33.670 --> 01:23:34.830
equally.

01:23:34.938 --> 01:23:38.806
Now that's the spirit!
You've learned to share! Do you accept?

01:23:45.515 --> 01:23:47.506
No, Your Honor, we do not.

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.448
Gold-digging whore.

01:23:50.554 --> 01:23:54.456
My client has advised me that
she doesn't want any of the money.

01:23:55.425 --> 01:23:57.393
She just wants a divorce.

01:23:58.328 --> 01:24:00.387
Miss McNally, are you sure?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.924
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

01:24:05.035 --> 01:24:09.972
Well, then I hereby grant the divorce
and award all the monies to Mr. Fuller.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.269
Court adjourned.

01:24:17.881 --> 01:24:19.405
You win, Jack.

01:24:19.516 --> 01:24:21.984
I officially want nothing from you.

01:24:28.992 --> 01:24:30.516
Oh, my God.

01:24:30.627 --> 01:24:33.653
I won a case! Jesus Christ!

01:24:33.764 --> 01:24:35.755
Dude, we won!

01:24:36.033 --> 01:24:37.295
I won!

01:24:37.401 --> 01:24:40.131
Yeah! I'm the law, bitches!

01:24:40.237 --> 01:24:41.761
I'm a lawyer!

01:24:42.472 --> 01:24:43.666
To me!

01:24:44.474 --> 01:24:46.305
Anybody need a lawyer?

01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:50.738
<i>And tonight I have to leave it</i>

01:24:52.949 --> 01:24:54.780
Time heals all wounds.

01:24:56.586 --> 01:25:02.525
Now that you guys are officially done,
I was hoping to maybe get her number.

01:25:02.626 --> 01:25:04.594
<i>Yes, tonight I have to leave it</i>

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:09.927
<i>Don't you come up to me
and say you like it</i>

01:25:10.033 --> 01:25:11.364
Yeah, okay.

01:25:11.835 --> 01:25:14.497
You don't have to answer that right now.

01:25:18.608 --> 01:25:20.701
Hey, I have a question.

01:25:21.945 --> 01:25:23.970
How much does an island cost?

01:25:24.281 --> 01:25:26.078
<i>And tonight I have to leave it</i>

01:25:27.284 --> 01:25:29.616
<i>Yes, tonight I have to leave it</i>

01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:35.215
Now we come to the final item
on our agenda.

01:25:37.194 --> 01:25:39.162
Congratulations, McNally.

01:25:41.965 --> 01:25:44.525
Thank you, sir. I won't let you down.

01:25:50.507 --> 01:25:53.442
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to
let you down.

01:25:53.543 --> 01:25:56.011
Why don't you just give it to Chong,
you know?

01:25:56.113 --> 01:25:57.512
She's good, she deserves it,

01:25:57.614 --> 01:26:00.082
and besides,
I think she just enjoys being miserable.

01:26:00.517 --> 01:26:02.644
- Yes!
- You sure you know what you're doing?

01:26:02.753 --> 01:26:05.688
No, I don't. But I think that's the point.

01:26:07.023 --> 01:26:09.617
I would rather do nothing and be happy

01:26:10.527 --> 01:26:13.052
than do something that I don't love.

01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:27.906
Well, I lost her at happy.

01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:29.706
I don't know what the hell
she was trying to say anyway.

01:26:29.813 --> 01:26:32.441
Well done, Chonger. The job is yours.

01:26:36.119 --> 01:26:37.381
Thank you.

01:26:38.221 --> 01:26:40.052
So! Jack made a piece of furniture.

01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:42.490
He finished it.

01:26:42.592 --> 01:26:44.219
Okay. Go ahead, Dad.
What's wrong with it?

01:26:44.327 --> 01:26:45.794
Nothing. It's good.

01:26:45.896 --> 01:26:48.160
It's really good. I'm proud of you.

01:26:51.334 --> 01:26:52.528
- Thank you.
- But...

01:26:52.636 --> 01:26:53.603
Here we go.

01:26:53.703 --> 01:26:55.261
...you royally screwed up
when it comes to that girl.

01:26:55.372 --> 01:26:59.138
It was a big, stupid mistake. Okay?
The entire marriage was a lie!

01:26:59.242 --> 01:27:01.767
The marriage might have been a mistake,
but it was not a lie.

01:27:01.878 --> 01:27:04.642
And I think that anybody
who has spent time with you two recently

01:27:04.748 --> 01:27:05.840
could tell you that.

01:27:05.949 --> 01:27:09.077
So why don't you get your head
out of your ass

01:27:09.186 --> 01:27:11.347
and go do something about it?

01:27:11.988 --> 01:27:15.321
Or should I tell you not to,
and then maybe you will?

01:27:18.662 --> 01:27:21.324
- She's gone, man.
- Gone? What do you mean, gone?

01:27:21.431 --> 01:27:25.731
She, like, lost it. She quit her job,
shut off her phone. She took off.

01:27:26.002 --> 01:27:27.993
Look, I don't really care much for you,

01:27:28.104 --> 01:27:29.901
and I want to cut your friend Hater.
Seriously.

01:27:30.006 --> 01:27:31.234
But for some reason,

01:27:31.341 --> 01:27:34.276
you're, like, the only man
that Joy can actually be herself with,

01:27:34.377 --> 01:27:38.313
so I wanna tell you where she is,
I really do. I just don't know.

01:27:38.982 --> 01:27:40.950
- What do you know?
- I don't know. If you were miserable

01:27:41.051 --> 01:27:44.487
and you wanted to get happy again,
where would you go?

01:27:46.289 --> 01:27:47.347
What?

01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:50.422
Thank you.

01:27:53.697 --> 01:27:55.995
Okay, tell you what. We both go.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:27:57.527
That way, when she sees us both,

01:27:57.634 --> 01:28:00.125
she can make up her mind
on who she wants to be with.

01:28:00.237 --> 01:28:04.105
I've loaned you my band saw,
I've loaned you my beer tap.

01:28:04.207 --> 01:28:05.731
Do you even know
how to drive an automatic?

01:28:05.842 --> 01:28:07.503
The keys. Give me the keys.

01:28:07.611 --> 01:28:08.976
Here. Sorry.

01:28:09.779 --> 01:28:12.145
Go get your future ex-ex-wife.

01:28:21.391 --> 01:28:25.157
<i>What a waste of time
The thought crossed my mind</i>

01:28:25.262 --> 01:28:28.095
<i>But I never missed a beat</i>

01:28:28.632 --> 01:28:32.568
<i>Can't explain the who or what I was</i>

01:28:32.969 --> 01:28:35.494
<i>Trying to believe</i>

01:28:35.872 --> 01:28:37.965
<i>What would you do?</i>

01:28:39.676 --> 01:28:42.873
<i>What would you do?
Do you know?</i>

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.872
<i>I once had a grip on everything</i>

01:28:46.983 --> 01:28:50.146
<i>It feels better to let go</i>

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.786
<i>I'm not over</i>

01:28:54.124 --> 01:28:57.651
<i>I'm not over you just yet</i>

01:28:57.761 --> 01:29:00.127
<i>Cannot hide it</i>

01:29:01.398 --> 01:29:05.065
<i>You're not that easy to forget</i>

01:29:05.268 --> 01:29:08.328
<i>I'm not over</i>

01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:14.866
<i>I'm not over</i>

01:29:38.301 --> 01:29:39.666
You found me.

01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:43.434
You left this behind,

01:29:44.741 --> 01:29:48.541
and I wanted to bring it back to you.

01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:57.884
Do you know how many lighthouses
there are 30 miles east of the city?

01:29:57.988 --> 01:29:59.717
- How many?
- Five.

01:29:59.823 --> 01:30:02.690
- Really?
- Yeah, just in case you're wondering.

01:30:02.792 --> 01:30:03.781
So.

01:30:05.028 --> 01:30:10.557
Did you come all the way out here
just to give this back to me?

01:30:11.568 --> 01:30:14.230
I did. So I'm going to get out of here.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.971
All right. Here it is.

01:30:19.976 --> 01:30:22.536
When we were married, I was horrible.

01:30:23.346 --> 01:30:25.940
Sick. Just wrong.

01:30:28.184 --> 01:30:30.744
And it's the best time I've ever had.

01:30:34.457 --> 01:30:36.755
You bet on me, Joy,

01:30:39.396 --> 01:30:41.990
and you made me want to bet on myself.

01:30:42.465 --> 01:30:45.696
So don't think about anyone else

01:30:46.236 --> 01:30:49.205
and just answer this for you.

01:30:57.981 --> 01:31:00.279
Do you want to be married to me?

01:31:01.384 --> 01:31:02.510
Again?

01:31:05.155 --> 01:31:06.383
You know,

01:31:07.791 --> 01:31:10.919
for so long, I've just...
I've tried to please everybody.

01:31:11.428 --> 01:31:14.488
And by not trying to please you,

01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:19.362
I think I became myself again.

01:31:22.605 --> 01:31:23.629
I do

01:31:24.808 --> 01:31:28.642
want to be married to you again.

01:31:55.138 --> 01:31:56.571
I quit my job.

01:31:57.841 --> 01:31:59.035
I heard.

01:31:59.309 --> 01:32:02.710
I have absolutely no idea
what I'm going to do. No clue.

01:32:02.812 --> 01:32:07.442
Well, it's a good thing that I have...
That we have a ton of money.

01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:09.177
Oh, my God!

01:32:10.687 --> 01:32:14.123
That's right. We hit the jackpot.

01:32:14.924 --> 01:32:16.289
Yeah, I did.

01:32:21.364 --> 01:32:24.231
Now, Joy, do you take this young man

01:32:25.435 --> 01:32:29.997
to be your lawfully wedded husband,
in sickness and in health...

01:32:30.373 --> 01:32:31.362
Uh-huh.

01:32:31.474 --> 01:32:33.499
...for richer or for poorer...

01:32:34.544 --> 01:32:35.841
I do. I take him.

01:32:35.945 --> 01:32:37.708
Naughty! Naughty!

01:32:37.814 --> 01:32:40.715
Jack, would you put the ring
upon her finger?

01:32:41.651 --> 01:32:44.119
- Was that the one?
- That was it! Oh, my God!

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.949
You may kiss the bride.

01:32:47.991 --> 01:32:49.618
This is the greatest day of my life!

01:32:50.126 --> 01:32:53.721
- This is the greatest day of my...
- What? What?

01:32:55.632 --> 01:32:56.724
Oh, my...

01:32:56.966 --> 01:32:58.456
This is marvelous, simply marvelous.

01:32:58.568 --> 01:33:00.559
- Bye! Thank you!
- Bye-bye.

01:33:00.703 --> 01:33:02.398
Have fun, you guys!

01:33:02.505 --> 01:33:04.132
It's so much fun in there!
You guys are gonna love it!

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.333
- Woman!
- Holy shit.

01:33:06.442 --> 01:33:08.433
- Woman!
- I'm coming!

01:33:10.413 --> 01:33:11.505

01:33:36.906 --> 01:33:38.339
You know why!

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.068

<i>Go ahead, boy, drink your drink
Go ahead, boy, do your thing</i>

What are you doing later? You know,
there's a meteor shower tonight.

01:38:19.388 --> 01:38:20.821
You know what?

01:38:20.923 --> 01:38:23.517
Jack was our glue.

01:38:23.626 --> 01:38:26.026
I feel like the fact that he's gone
makes us a little closer.

01:38:26.129 --> 01:38:28.495
No, it makes us a little bit just...

01:38:29.031 --> 01:38:30.794
The opposite of that.

01:38:39.509 --> 01:38:41.007
You like
to party?

01:38:43.137 --> 01:38:44.138
