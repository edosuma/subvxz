01:24.580 --> 01:27.300
Hi, Mimmi.
-You'll never guess what I just found.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.940
Arctic sea lavender
growing right here at Mako.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.340
Why the fuss? It's just a plant.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.780
A plant usually only found
in the North Atlantic.

01:34.860 --> 01:35.860
It's beautiful.

01:35.940 --> 01:38.140
Even better,
you can cook with it.

01:38.220 --> 01:39.860
What could you make from that?

01:39.940 --> 01:41.660
Arctic marshmallow.

01:41.740 --> 01:44.700
I like the sound of that.
-You'll like the taste even better.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.220
We'll just need some more
Arctic sea lavender,

01:46.300 --> 01:47.300
some old oyster shells--

01:47.380 --> 01:50.620
Sorry, I'll have to leave you to
it or I'll be late for school.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.500
Save me some?
-Of course.

01:59.980 --> 02:02.180
If it's as good as you say...

02:02.260 --> 02:05.380
we could always tell her it didn't
work and eat it all ourselves.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.580
Mmm.

02:09.340 --> 02:12.940
Ugh! Nothing that smelly
could ever taste good.

02:13.020 --> 02:14.380
That's the magic of cooking.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.140
And it'll be a nice change
from eating out at the café.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.900
What do you mean?
I cooked yesterday.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.220
Which is why we ended
up at the café.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.820
I was trying something new.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.380
Sea urchin stew
with cat fish tails?

02:26.460 --> 02:29.700
It wasn't so bad
once you took the spines out.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.340
Where did you even find
a recipe like that?

02:32.420 --> 02:34.180
What recipe? I made it up.

02:34.260 --> 02:37.660
That's your problem.
Cooking is like spells.

02:37.740 --> 02:43.220
You can't just invent it. You have
to follow instructions precisely.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.420
You do it your way,
I will do it mine.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.900
Hey!
- What are you doing there?

02:50.980 --> 02:52.260
Trying to sleep.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.420
Why don't you sleep in the water
like every other mermaid?

02:54.500 --> 02:57.380
Probably because I'm not
like every other mermaid.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.980
That is one way of putting it.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.060
See you after school, girls.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.180
Coming, Weilan?

03:04.220 --> 03:06.180
I wasn't planning on it.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.740
You're not here for a holiday.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.380
Mermaids of your
age belong in class,

03:11.460 --> 03:14.860
either with the pod or on land.
Your choice.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.060
An F?
I know I did better than that.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.340
Alas, no.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.180
And unless your work improves,

03:31.260 --> 03:32.780
you're going to be seeing
a lot more of them,

03:32.860 --> 03:35.700
starting tomorrow
with a revision test on cells.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.220
Ms. Trumble, this is Weilan.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.540
She'll be joining your class. She
recently relocated from Shanghai.

03:44.620 --> 03:48.900
We're well into the school year. It'll
be a struggle for her to catch up.

03:48.980 --> 03:51.340
This is her last report.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.500
Straight A's!

03:59.300 --> 04:01.180
Welcome, Weilan.

04:01.260 --> 04:05.500
I look forward to having
someone of your caliber join us.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.260
Why don't you sit next to Zac?

04:08.340 --> 04:11.260
With any luck,
some of your academic prowess...

04:11.340 --> 04:13.540
Get out, Evie!
...might rub off on him.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.260
Can you add the oysters?
-Ugh. Anything to get rid of them.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.540
What are you doing?

04:34.620 --> 04:36.860
I need to chill the water
to the exact temperature

04:36.940 --> 04:39.380
of the Beaufort Sea
in late December.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.620
I'm guessing that's pretty cold.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.700
The Beaufort Sea is right near
the Arctic Circle.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.740
It's ready when the
ice starts to form.

04:45.820 --> 04:47.820
Oh, I can give you a hand there.
-No!

04:47.900 --> 04:51.100
Too fast and we'll freeze the
lavender and crack the shells.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.660
It has to be cooled gradually.

04:52.740 --> 04:56.820
How long's that gonna take?
-Until that runs out.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.460
Any longer and you risk
the polar bears smelling it.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.980
Polar bears?
-They adore Arctic marshmallow.

05:02.060 --> 05:04.820
You have to make it and get away
before they can smell it.

05:04.900 --> 05:08.380
With a smell like that, I'm surprised
even polar bears are interested.

05:12.500 --> 05:15.380
Ms. Trumble was way harsh.

05:15.460 --> 05:18.620
Yeah, we call her Ms. Trouble.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.300
I had a teacher like
her back in Shanghai.

05:21.380 --> 05:24.220
I think there's a factory
somewhere that makes them.

05:26.740 --> 05:28.300
So why are you here anyway?

05:28.380 --> 05:31.420
None of the other mermaids
ever signed up for school.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.220
I don't have a pod. I've been
at land school for years.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.860
Can't you join the Mako pod?

05:36.940 --> 05:39.220
I mean, that's got to be
better than being here.

05:39.300 --> 05:43.060
I don't know a thing about mermaid
school. I'd be getting F's like you.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.180
Thanks for the reminder.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.260
You just need to study
more effectively.

05:49.580 --> 05:51.020
How?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.300
Maybe you need a study partner.

05:53.380 --> 05:57.660
Well, I used to study with Evie, and
now she's too busy with mermaid stuff.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.100
I'm not.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.860
Seriously? You'd do that?

06:01.940 --> 06:04.420
Hey,
we tails have to stick together.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.780
Can you hurry up?
It is freezing in here.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.900
I told you, it can't be rushed.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.180
The temperature's right.
It's ready.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.380
It doesn't look
like marshmallow.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.180
No, it's ready for the
special ingredient.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.940
Dried plankton from
the Baltic Sea.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.380
What does that do?

06:27.460 --> 06:29.060
When the water's at
the right temperature,

06:29.140 --> 06:31.900
the flavors from the lavender
and the shells start to transfer,

06:31.980 --> 06:36.660
but the plankton stops the
process before it goes too far.

06:36.740 --> 06:37.900
Is that possible?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.260
I'd want to get rid
of these flavors altogether.

06:41.180 --> 06:42.460
It's nearly there.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.300
And...

06:49.900 --> 06:52.660
And that's how you make
Arctic marshmallow.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.860
Care to taste?

06:55.780 --> 06:58.100
What happens if you don't throw
that stuff in at the right moment?

06:58.180 --> 07:03.100
The flavors continue to transfer and
you end up with some foul-tasting goo.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.540
It's delicious.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.460
It's tart yet sweet.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.340
It's pretty amazing, huh?

07:14.500 --> 07:18.260
It's not quite sweet enough.
Maybe I should make it next time.

07:18.340 --> 07:21.180
This is a complicated
Northern mermaid recipe.

07:21.260 --> 07:23.100
It looked pretty simple to me.

07:23.180 --> 07:25.580
And if you can do it, so can I.

07:25.660 --> 07:26.740
I'd like to see you try.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.380
You think I can't cook,
don't you?

07:32.180 --> 07:34.860
I will make this...
first thing tomorrow.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.100
I can't wait.

07:37.180 --> 07:39.380
Lysosomes are a part
of the cell which...

07:39.460 --> 07:40.460
Come on.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.460
Lysosomes are... are a part
of the cell which merges--

07:45.540 --> 07:49.940
No! Lysosomes break down waste
material. We just went over this.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.340
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna remember it.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.740
I am so not passing
this test tomorrow.

07:55.820 --> 07:59.220
I wish I had your brain.
-That's a spell I've never tried.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.300
You mean there's a spell
for swapping brains?

08:03.820 --> 08:05.380
Well,
it's not exactly a brain swap.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.500
It's more like a...
knowledge transference.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.780
So... so you could make me know
what you know?

08:13.820 --> 08:15.940
Theoretically,
if I was, like, a...

08:16.020 --> 08:19.100
tenth-level Eastern mermaid.
Which I'm not.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.580
Do it.
-Didn't you hear what I just said?

08:22.540 --> 08:24.980
No way.
-I can't afford to get another F tomorrow.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.500
And I can't do a spell
I've never done before.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.980
And my parents are on my back
about doing well, and...

08:30.060 --> 08:32.179
I don't know what else to do.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.340
Please.

08:40.059 --> 08:41.220
Okay.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.580
But stand very still.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.340
Okay.

09:11.940 --> 09:13.300
Is that it?

09:15.460 --> 09:17.380
I think so.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.220
Let's try another question.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.740
Okay. What is the primary
function of vacuoles?

09:27.820 --> 09:29.620
They're a part of
the cell which...

09:30.620 --> 09:31.620
Wait a second...

09:34.860 --> 09:35.940
I got nothing.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.740
I warned you.
- Thanks for trying.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.500
Uh, you better get going.
I'm in for a long night.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.820
Sorry I couldn't help.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.980
So I combine the Arctic
sea lavender and shells,

10:33.060 --> 10:35.620
chill until there's ice,
add the plankton, and hey...

10:35.700 --> 10:37.380
Arctic marshmallow.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.460
It's not as simple
as you make it sound.

10:39.540 --> 10:41.820
Really? Did I leave a step out?

10:41.900 --> 10:43.740
Well... no.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.900
Then obviously it's that simple.

10:45.980 --> 10:48.020
Keep it down.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.740
Sorry, sleepy time is over.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.660
What?

10:54.780 --> 10:55.940
Bed hair?

10:56.900 --> 10:58.100
Uh...

10:58.180 --> 11:01.340
You should look in the mirror.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.340
You.
-Me?

11:21.420 --> 11:23.740
I told you that
spell was a bad idea.

11:26.580 --> 11:27.620
No kidding!

11:27.700 --> 11:29.060
What are you gonna do about it?
-Me?

11:29.140 --> 11:31.060
I warned you I'd
never done the spell.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.980
You should have
talked me out of it.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.020
I tried. You wouldn't listen!

11:35.100 --> 11:37.540
But you should've made me!
-Argh!

11:38.540 --> 11:40.540
What is this, casual hair day?

11:45.060 --> 11:47.140
Zac made me use a
transference spell.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.620
For swapping hair?

11:50.340 --> 11:53.180
To share knowledge
for the biology test.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.220
It went wrong.
-You think?

11:56.660 --> 11:59.500
You know, if you went dreadlock,
you could join a reggae band.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.660
Can you fix this?

12:02.540 --> 12:03.620
I don't know.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.580
We better get to class.
-I can't go in looking like this.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.980
If you don't sit the test,
you'll fail.

12:25.340 --> 12:28.060
Caps off, please.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.020
This is not a sporting event.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.540
Sorry, Ms. Trumble.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.700
Ah, I've got a fungal
infection... on my scalp.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.020
It's pretty ugly and
probably contagious.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.580
And you have the same condition?

12:41.380 --> 12:42.460
Lice.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.500
Well, perhaps the caps
are best left where they are.

12:47.580 --> 12:51.100
Moving on,
you can turn over your pages.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.140
You have 40 minutes, starting...

12:55.580 --> 12:56.620
now.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.220
Yes?

13:41.100 --> 13:42.140
All done.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.700
In nine minutes?

13:56.780 --> 13:59.060
98 out of 100.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.620
Congratulations, Zac.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.100
I don't think congratulations
are in order.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.300
Zac got an F on his last test.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.740
An inconsistency which I believe
warrants an investigation.

14:11.820 --> 14:14.980
Zac's last mark obviously
pushed him to study harder.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.980
There is another explanation.

14:20.340 --> 14:21.940
Are you implying Zac cheated?

14:22.020 --> 14:25.700
Well, the extraordinary disparity
in his results would suggest that.

14:25.780 --> 14:28.020
And I've just offered
an alternative explanation,

14:28.100 --> 14:29.820
so I see no reason
to take this further.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.220
Oh, one can't help wondering
if there's another reason

14:32.300 --> 14:34.460
why you don't wish
to pursue the matter.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.900
And what might that be?

14:35.980 --> 14:40.180
Well, Zac's father
is head of the school board.

14:40.260 --> 14:43.020
I imagine you'd be
reluctant to do anything

14:43.100 --> 14:45.660
that would jeopardize
your position here.

14:45.740 --> 14:50.220
I wouldn't hesitate to call Dr.
Blakely if I thought it was necessary.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.140
Good.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.860
I already called him.

14:57.940 --> 15:01.380
Thank you for coming
so promptly, Dr. Blakely.

15:05.540 --> 15:06.820
What's going on?

15:09.620 --> 15:12.100
Don't chill the water too fast.
-I know.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.140
Remember to keep
an eye on the time.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.140
I've still got plenty, right?
-Well, you're the one doing the cooking.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.340
Is this cold enough?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.580
If you had been paying
attention, you would know.

15:25.460 --> 15:29.100
You could be a little helpful. I've
never swum in the Beaufort Sea.

15:29.180 --> 15:31.980
But you said the recipe was simple.
-It is.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.340
Then why do you keep
asking me for help?

15:38.300 --> 15:39.740
You have to do something.

15:39.820 --> 15:41.660
I'm thinking.
-Well, think harder.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.060
I can't remember how I did it.
It's like...

15:47.060 --> 15:50.020
It's like I drained my brain
and gave it all to Zac.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.220
I wish you could've
done that to me.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.780
I seriously need
help with chemistry.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.300
If Zac knows
everything you know...

15:59.380 --> 16:01.420
can't we just ask him
how to reverse the spell?

16:01.500 --> 16:04.140
No, because I never knew how
in the first place.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.620
I'd never done the spell.
I told him that.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.900
So he's just gonna stay like this?
-Hey!

16:09.980 --> 16:12.740
He's not the only one suffering
here. I don't like feeling this dumb!

16:12.820 --> 16:15.140
Hey, that's my boyfriend
you're talking about.

16:15.220 --> 16:17.540
Yeah, well,
a part of him is me now.

16:18.220 --> 16:21.100
Well, this just got
a whole lot weirder.

16:22.540 --> 16:26.140
I know Zac has struggled lately with
his studies, but I can assure you...

16:26.220 --> 16:27.860
he is not a cheat.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.220
Right, Zac?

16:31.300 --> 16:34.580
I took on board what you and Mum
said about knuckling down...

16:34.660 --> 16:38.340
and I studied hard,
and it all clicked.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.700
As easy as that?

16:40.780 --> 16:42.820
On the contrary,
it wasn't easy at all.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.700
Zac's been studying very hard.
He was up very late last night.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.900
I never even went to bed.

16:54.220 --> 16:55.740
I, uh, I never even...

16:55.820 --> 16:57.180
took a break.

16:57.780 --> 16:58.820
Are you all right?

17:01.740 --> 17:04.460
I just... I need some water.
I've got a...

17:04.540 --> 17:06.220
frog in my throat.

17:08.300 --> 17:12.339
Perhaps the best way to settle
this is for Zac to resit the test?

17:13.420 --> 17:15.579
Seems fair. Zac?

17:19.140 --> 17:20.819
Mmm-hmm.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.460
Hmm.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.579
What is that supposed to mean?
-What?

17:26.660 --> 17:28.020
That noise you just made.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.220
Nothing. I... I mean...

17:31.300 --> 17:33.660
you can do it that
way if you want.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.940
No, I am not doing
anything you didn't do!

17:39.020 --> 17:42.740
As you said, I make it my way,
you make it yours.

17:42.820 --> 17:45.180
Exactly,
so just let me get on with it.

17:47.260 --> 17:50.900
The temperature is correct.
The time looks good.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.980
Ondina,
the sand hasn't run out yet.

17:53.060 --> 17:56.060
I want it sweeter, so I'm stopping
the flavor transference early.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.140
Ondina, no!

18:12.380 --> 18:15.300
Now do you see why it's a good
idea to follow the recipe?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.380
We have to ask Rita.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.500
You want to tell Rita that
you helped Zac cheat on a test?

18:23.580 --> 18:25.660
How about Mimmi? She might...
know how to do it.

18:27.780 --> 18:29.260
Why do you sound like Zac?

18:29.340 --> 18:31.700
What? I don't.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.300
I heard it, too.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.140
Don't be ridiculous.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.580
I don't sound like--

18:38.980 --> 18:40.340
What have you done to me?

18:42.420 --> 18:43.940
This cannot be happening!

18:47.940 --> 18:51.220
What were you thinking, trying
a spell you'd never done before?

18:51.300 --> 18:53.420
I warned Zac it was a bad idea.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.860
Then why did you do it?

18:54.940 --> 18:57.220
The point is...
can you reverse it?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.020
We can try.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.180
Stop! Stop!

19:09.260 --> 19:10.340
What?

19:10.420 --> 19:11.980
My face is really itchy.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.660
I don't want to have to shave.

19:13.740 --> 19:16.740
Ah, don't worry.
You're both gonna be fine.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.380
We didn't reverse it, we
accelerated it, and that means--

19:23.460 --> 19:24.780
Means what?

19:24.860 --> 19:27.220
It means they're gonna keep on
transferring, not just knowledge,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.820
but... all of them.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.660
Great. My boyfriend is gonna
become my girlfriend?

19:32.620 --> 19:35.500
It's a pity it's not like making
Arctic marshmallow.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.700
We could use the Baltic Sea
plankton to stop the transference.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.300
That's not a bad idea.
-I was joking.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.700
I'm not.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.100
We're going to
need a bigger bowl.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.140
A much bigger bowl.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.300
Can you hurry this up?

19:57.380 --> 19:58.940
I'm freezing.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.580
Just a bit longer.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.740
My tail's turning blue.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.300
Of course it is. You're cold.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.540
Then why is my tail
turning orange?

20:11.620 --> 20:13.420
The transformation's
almost complete.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.300
Do something, Mimmi!
-It's nearly there.

20:17.580 --> 20:18.940
I feel weird.

20:19.820 --> 20:21.620
Me too.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.660
Do it now, Mimmi!
-We have to wait.

20:25.380 --> 20:28.820
Everything's going hazy.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.100
Help.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.580
No!

20:43.180 --> 20:45.140
Zac! Zac!

20:46.980 --> 20:48.220
Weilan!

20:57.180 --> 20:58.460
Zac!

20:58.540 --> 21:00.780
Are you okay?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.460
Whatever you did... it worked.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.820
And you thought I couldn't cook.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.020
Uh...

21:22.100 --> 21:24.940
Oh, glad to see you're up. How
are you feeling? That cough gone?

21:26.220 --> 21:28.460
Yeah.
I'm absolutely back to normal.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.380
Look, Zac...

21:30.460 --> 21:33.460
I hope we didn't put too much
pressure on you about doing well.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.740
It doesn't matter
what marks you get, darling.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.060
Your father and I just want you
to do your best.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.660
Don't worry, I will.

21:41.540 --> 21:43.780
And it will be my best,
not anyone else's.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.700
Mmm, very pleased to hear that.

21:47.780 --> 21:50.220
Now come and have breakfast
or you'll be late.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.740
Late for what?

21:55.140 --> 21:56.900
You may begin...

21:58.620 --> 21:59.740
now.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.940
C-plus. I passed.

22:09.380 --> 22:12.940
And you did it all by yourself.
No magic required.

22:15.140 --> 22:17.620
And I made this all by myself.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.820
Arctic marshmallow?
-Mmm-hmm.

22:25.180 --> 22:27.060
Mmm. It looks good, Ondina.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.740
I even followed the recipe,
more or less.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.820
Café?
- Mmm.

22:39.940 --> 22:41.780
It can't be that bad.

22:55.260 --> 22:56.940
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:57.020 --> 22:58.300
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:58.380 --> 23:01.700
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:01.780 --> 23:03.860

23:03.940 --> 23:08.780
