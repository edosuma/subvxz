LIZ:
What are you doing here?

37:17.944 --> 37:19.400
I missed you.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.854
Yeah, I dyed my hair to hide.
I don't need to hide anymore.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.281
Lizzy, l misspoke earlier...

37:25.452 --> 37:27.443
...about your child.

37:28.872 --> 37:32.410
I said that having it would be...

37:33.460 --> 37:35.542
...inconvenient.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.169
You got me a couch.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.462
When your mother
was pregnant with you...

37:43.636 --> 37:45.501
...it was terribly inconvenient.

37:45.722 --> 37:50.341
The Cold War was ending.
Her country was falling apart.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.927
Everything she had ever known....

38:01.613 --> 38:03.649
She dreaded having a child.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.860
Almost aborted it.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.030
Not one day of her pregnancy...

38:09.204 --> 38:11.786
...did she ever think of you
as anything but a curse.

38:12.207 --> 38:16.075
And then,
from the second you were born...

38:17.712 --> 38:20.203
...there was never a day when she...

38:20.381 --> 38:23.214
...thought you were anything
but a blessing.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.292
In my experience...

38:26.471 --> 38:30.134
...there is never a convenient time
to have a child.

38:31.726 --> 38:35.719
It certainly isn't
a convenient time for you.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.481
But if, in saying that,
I left you with the impression...

38:40.652 --> 38:42.984
...that I didn't think
you should have your baby...

38:43.154 --> 38:44.360
...l'm sorry for that...

38:44.531 --> 38:47.318
...because nothing
could be further from the truth.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.407
Tom.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.531
What I did was for your protection.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.907
Taking his job away.

38:54.123 --> 38:57.160
I'm not a threat to your safety, Lizzy,
or your child's.

38:57.377 --> 39:01.040
On the contrary, I can guarantee it,
but I cannot do that if you run away.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.247
You're the only reason
I need protection.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.715

39:11.432 --> 39:12.592
Yeah.

39:15.311 --> 39:19.054
Oh, I should probably mention,
I booked a pregnancy massage for you.

She'll be here at 9.
Her name's Edwina.

39:21.568 --> 39:26.562
She's a registered nurse,
and she smells absolutely divine.

the rest of your stuff.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.213
I know it was you who wrote about me
in Ressler's report.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.222
Oh, that.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.854
-Too many gerunds?
-He didn't even know.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.310
What did you do,
hack into his computer?

40:03.568 --> 40:07.402
I know it was the wrong thing to do,
but this task force needs you.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.112
I don't deserve a friend like you.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.322
Maybe not.
