WEBVTT

00:07.716 --> 00:09.543
- Okay, I'll... I'll get that.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.303
Hey, Manny's getting his outfit together
for the dance tonight...

00:14.389 --> 00:16.465
I was just taking
some supplies out to the car.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.302
Isn't this exciting,
the boys' first dance?

00:18.393 --> 00:22.142
Greatest day of my life.
Does Phil have a green pocket square for him?

00:22.231 --> 00:23.808
- Teal.
- Teal.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.900
I don't know. I don't think Phil's really
a pocket square kind of a guy.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.314
Wow.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.108
Wow.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.774
Why don't we conference in Mitch?

00:33.158 --> 00:34.985
<i>Ay,</i> look. This might work.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.365
Well, except that it's turquoise.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.996
Oh, and a bra!

00:39.081 --> 00:41.786
Do you think the kids in my village
have pocket squares?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.369
Here we go with the village.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.868
- Dad, you still there?
- Unfortunately, yes.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.248
Please ask Claire what time do I need
to be at the school to help set up.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.298
- Gloria wants to know...
- <i>No, I heard. I heard.</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:55.513
Um, tell her thank you so much, but we
have all the help we could possibly need...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.886
and she doesn't even have to come
tonight if she doesn't want to.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.766
- Claire said...
- I heard.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.355
- Oh, hey, Mitch. Where are you?
- <i>Oh, we're at the park.</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:07.766
You would not believe how
some of these people dress their kids.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.814
Lily's friend just pulled a Britney Spears
getting out of a sandbox car.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.482
So Dad's on the line.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.324
Do you have a teal
pocket square for Manny?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.318
Cam, Manny needs a teal pocket square.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.032
- Oh, I've got teal, I've got aqua, I've got seafoam.
- Yeah, Cam's got one.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.114
- Cam's got one.
- Yes!

01:22.207 --> 01:24.034
Oh, you know what? I lent it to Andre.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.786
Uh, he lent it to Andre.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.954
- Flag on the play.
- What's that mean?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.624
What's it mean?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.460
Now I got to go to the mall.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.210
Is this okay?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.629
Oh, hey, Luke has to go to the mall too.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.632
- What?
 Phil.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.303
Let's go, Incredible Hulk.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.805
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:45.898 --> 01:47.890
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:47.983 --> 01:49.892
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:49.985 --> 01:52.025
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.275
<i># Hey ##</i>

01:57.242 --> 01:58.571
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.320
Is that your little girl over there, Lily?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.120
- Yes. Look at her.
- Yes.

02:02.206 --> 02:05.539
Uh, this is a little bit awkward,
but she bit Tyler.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.080
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my goodness.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.127
I... I don't even know what to say.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.752
She's never done anything like that before.
How did it happen?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.300
I don't know. I didn't see it.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.424
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.504
It's time to play everyone's favorite game.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.091
"Let's blame the gay dads."

02:20.182 --> 02:23.099
- You know who had straight parents... Adolf Hitler.
- Charles Manson.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.012
- Shall we go on?
- Naomi Campbell.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.977
I know it happened.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.056
He's got bite marks on his arm.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.608
Oh, wow, yeah. Oh, gosh.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.768
Someone really sunk
their teeth into ya, huh?

02:32.861 --> 02:36.361
It's 'cause you're such
a yummy little guy. Yes.  

02:36.448 --> 02:37.942
Our daughter didn't do that.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.611
- But he said...
- Right.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.160
He's probably just confused.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.321
You know who I bet did it, though? Billy.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.786
Rhymes with "Lily."
Plus, he is very aggressive.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.534
His babysitter is right over there.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.868
She's... She's not much
of a disciplinarian.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.456
Because I can assure you...

02:51.547 --> 02:53.005
if our child did something like this...

02:53.090 --> 02:54.964
we would be on her like white on rice.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.458
And I know that sounds
a little bit like a racial slur...

02:57.553 --> 02:59.711
because we're white
and she presumably likes rice...

02:59.805 --> 03:01.714
but I didn't intend it that way.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.059
Ah, finally. There's a spot.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.220
Oh.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.684
Guys, I am just bursting
with pride right now.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.560
Your first dance.
Soon you're gonna be men.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.644
I want you to know
there's more to being a man...

03:14.736 --> 03:16.195
than just shopping for fancy outfits.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.071
Yep. Pretty soon you get
some hair on your chest.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.529
You start answering the phone,
people don't think you're ladies.

03:22.578 --> 03:23.988
Come on. Today, Miss Daisy.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.662
Actually, Miss Daisy was the one
being driven, not the one driving.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.454
- Never saw it.
- It's called <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

03:30.544 --> 03:32.951
You got a real lip on you today,
you know that?

03:37.843 --> 03:39.503
Hey, that was our spot!

03:39.595 --> 03:42.596
What are you doing?
You gonna let him snake your spot?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.175
Not worth it.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.591
Boys, here's the only thing
you gotta know about being a man...

03:46.685 --> 03:48.594
never let someone take what is yours.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.688
Unless it's just a parking spot
and there's plenty of others.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.766
That's sweet, Phil.
You ought to write that down.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.480
You got any lipstick in your purse?

03:56.570 --> 03:59.025
I love Jay.
Are you kidding me? He's my boy.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.364
Yeah, he gives me a hard time,
but that's the deal with a father-in-law.

04:02.451 --> 04:07.492
The key is, I never let him see
just how much it devastates me.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.704
- It's Dunphy.
- That's what I said... Dumphy.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.117
No, not "Dum." Dunphy.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.206
Dumphy.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.326
- Say "Dun."
- Dun.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.880
- Say "phy."
- Phy.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.423
- Dunphy.
- Dumphy.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.043
All right, just bring it this way.
This way.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.130
There it is. Perfect. Thank you. Perfect.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.548
- Claire!
- What?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.350
Can you ask Gus to fix that light?

04:28.435 --> 04:31.222
- I asked him, but he just growled at me.
- Oh, gosh. Okay.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.184
Gus, stop scaring Bethenny
and fix the light, please.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.733
Don't make me come over there.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.894
I'm busy. You fix it.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.486
Is this because I said
I wouldn't come to the dance with you?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.566
Gus, I'm a married woman.
People would talk.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.984
One dance with me,
you'd forget all about it.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.995
Yeah, I already have a husband
who doesn't fix lights.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.658
Please?

04:52.835 --> 04:54.578
- Thank you so much.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.958
This school would literally
fall apart without you.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.707
Oh, well, I don't know
about "literally," but...

04:58.799 --> 05:01.586
<i>ยก Hola! ยก Hola!</i> I'm here.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.084
Oh, you came anyway. That's great.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.804
I think it's great too.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.926
A few weeks ago, they asked for someone
to be in charge of the school dance...

05:09.017 --> 05:10.512
and I volunteered.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.220
The school asks for volunteers
so that everybody will feel included.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.434
But who are they kidding?
They want me to do it.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.895
I've put on every school dance
since Haley was 12. It's my thing.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.861
They made us cochairs...

05:22.948 --> 05:25.865
which means we're supposed
to do everything together.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.118
But Claire won't take any of my ideas.

05:29.204 --> 05:32.988
She suggested an Arabian Nights theme.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.874
Isn't it a little soon?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.787
Okay. Hey, everybody...

05:36.879 --> 05:39.370
do you know Gloria, Manny's mom?

05:39.464 --> 05:42.086
- She's here to help us out today.
- I'm the cochair.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.718
 Oh.
 Mm-hmm.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.254
So the kids are gonna be here in two
hours, so everybody back to work.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.925
Everybody back to work.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.510
I just said that.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.392
And I just co-said it.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.645
I mean the nerve of that lady,
accusing Lily.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.560
Mmm. You know what?
You can't change people, Cam.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.525
I mean, we just have to rise above.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.770
- Ow! Ohh!
- What happened?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.319
- She bit me.
- Are you serious?

06:06.408 --> 06:11.284
Ohh! She did it again.
It's like <i>Twilight</i> back here.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.168
because the lady say you biting.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.746
- Okay, go, go!
- Yeah.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.960
- Go, go, go. Drive.
- Okay.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.256
Are you sure this is teal?

06:28.347 --> 06:30.589
'Cause I'm starting to get
a real strong green thing here.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.509
That's the fluorescent lights.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.843
Do you mind if I walk this
over to Lamps Galore?

06:34.937 --> 06:36.728
I need you to worry about this less.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.265
Guess who fit into the suit
on the mannequin and saved us 20%?

06:40.359 --> 06:43.941
Here's something I didn't know about
mannequins... they don't have a wiener.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.523
What the heck is that?

06:45.614 --> 06:47.488
It's a nicer word for "penis."

06:47.574 --> 06:49.366
No, I mean, what the heck is this?

06:49.451 --> 06:51.029
- It's a tie.
- It's teal.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.693
I don't care.
I just grabbed the first one I saw.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.532
- Well, grab a different one.
- No!

06:55.624 --> 06:57.533
Now I like it.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.832
Uh, I think we were here first.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.292
I just have one thing. I'm in a big rush.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.504
- So are we.
- That's fine. Go ahead.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.714
- Seriously.
- Jay, it's not a big deal.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.375
And can you give me the sale prices
for some things I bought last week?

07:09.471 --> 07:12.223
Oh, for God's sake!
Now this is what I'm talking about, boys.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.300
You give people an inch,
they'll run all over you.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.220
Or you could just be nice.
Pay it forward.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.889
They don't make movies out of bad ideas.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.972
All I know is you gotta fight
for what you want.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.979
If there's one job available, this guy just
got it and they go hungry at the Dumphys.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.978
Dunphys.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.404
Okay, I don't get it. Why is she biting?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.409
- Lily, why are you biting?
- She's not biting, she's teething.

07:32.494 --> 07:37.240
On people. All right, she starts biting
her playdates, she's gonna be a pariah.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.910
- Try piranha.
- Really, Cam?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.080
It was right there.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.742
All right, you should also
know that I, in no way...

07:42.838 --> 07:44.914
in no way blame you.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.213
- Thank you. Why would you blame me?
- I don't.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.670
- Well, good, because I don't blame you.
- Well, obviously.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.680
- Uh, okay, well, now I'm starting to feel the blame.
- No.

07:53.765 --> 07:57.431
No. Don't. It's...
It's just that you're with her all day.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.769
Oh, wow. I have a daughter who bites
and a partner who stings.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.608
Okay. Okay, you want to know the truth?

08:03.692 --> 08:06.444
- Sometimes you send her some mixed signals.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.980
I'm gonna bite your feet.
I'm gonna bite 'em right off.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.786
Oh, I'm not the one
who uses my teeth like a multi-tool.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.413
Here we go.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.324
Cookies for Lily...

08:19.416 --> 08:22.121
wine for us.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.290
Okay.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.956
I can't believe you would equate that...

08:25.047 --> 08:28.048
Don't bite my head off.
I'm not a pack of batteries.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.087
- Whoa!
- <i>ยกAy!</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:39.429
- Why is this box here?
- I am sorry. We did because we were moving the tables.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.429
Why are you moving the tables?

08:41.522 --> 08:46.065
- So the kids have more space to dance. It's better this way.
- Is it really, Gloria?

08:46.151 --> 08:50.979
Because right now it kinda just looks like
a clump of tables and a big open space.

08:51.073 --> 08:54.157
Look, I'm sorry, but we've
always done it this way.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.078
And I think it's gonna throw people off
if you move them around.

08:57.162 --> 09:01.030
Oh, my God.
These tables look great. Who did this?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.117
- I did.
- I love it.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.834
Hello.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.328
We haven't been properly introduced.
I'm Gloria.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.965
I'm Bethenny.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.881
I don't know if anybody's ever told
you this, but you're really pretty.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.046
No. No, Bethenny,
no one's ever told her that.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.673
I am seriously freaking out
about these tables.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.519
You know what? Let's just put a pin in
where we're gonna put the tables.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.062
Yes, we're keeping the tables.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.427
So what else can I do?

09:24.523 --> 09:29.066
- Um, you can... help me with the chairs.
- Okay.

09:29.152 --> 09:33.446
We need a lot of them.
They're under the stage right here, so...

09:33.532 --> 09:36.402
It's like dirty and dark there, no?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.285
Yeah, I know. Bummer, right?

09:38.370 --> 09:39.449
Ew!

09:39.538 --> 09:42.705
- Off you go.
- It smells funny, Claire!

09:42.791 --> 09:45.282
- So sorry. Keep going.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.963
What? We needed chairs.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.390
What are you guys talking about?

10:05.480 --> 10:10.107
No, nothing. He was just saying
how much he loves the tables.  

10:11.486 --> 10:15.484
If I had the receipt,
I wouldn't need you to look it up.

10:15.574 --> 10:19.987
At this rate, I'm gonna
miss the first dance... at my wedding.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.905
I thought he only had one item?

10:21.997 --> 10:25.448
Tell your dad if it were up to me, we'd have
been in and out of here in about 10 minutes.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.286
- You mentioned that.
- And I'll probably mention it again.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.047
- Because thanks to someone, we're gonna be here a while.
- Yeah, I get it.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.001
- Luke, you should order that suit in a larger size...
- I get it.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.417
- Because by the time we get out of here...
- Pay for the suit.

10:35.511 --> 10:38.262
- Where the hell are you going?
- Luke needs socks.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.256
Make 'em teal.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.637
You're playing a very dangerous game.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.889
Hey, boys.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.181
Look who it is, the guy
that stole our parking spot.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.146
Are you going to hit him?
I'd totally hit him.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.269
I'm not gonna hit him, but I'm gonna
give him a piece of my mind.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.777
Now, boys, pay attention. You wanna be men?
This is how you handle a jerk like this.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.189
Hey, chief.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.533
- You know, you stole our parking space today.
- What?

11:01.620 --> 11:04.241
That's right. I was waiting for the parking
space, you sneaked right in there.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.790
That make you feel like a big man?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.959
- Did I? I didn't even notice.
- That's no excuse.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.953
I'm really sorry.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.581
My dog died today.
I had to put him to sleep.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.335
Fourteen years.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.880
He was all I had.

11:18.971 --> 11:22.304
Now I can't stand the thought of
going back to my empty apartment.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.964
- So I just keep wandering around the mall.
- You know what?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.633
Forget about the... spot.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.478
God! That was his name!

11:34.319 --> 11:35.944
Do not hit him.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.071
Oasis for Men?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.246
That's funny.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.740
You made that sound like a question,
then you didn't wait for me to answer.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.377
- What?
- Here, let me show you.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.166
You go... You go, "Oasis for... Men?"

11:54.256 --> 11:55.999
You see what I mean?
You went "Oasis for... Men?"

11:56.091 --> 11:58.416
You should have said, "Oasis for Men."
Then I go, "Yeah. Give me two."

11:58.510 --> 12:00.337
But instead, you went, "Oasis for... Men."

12:00.429 --> 12:01.923
- Okay, I get it.
- You see what I mean?

12:02.014 --> 12:04.884
- I get it!
- No, I'm not sure you do! You sprayed before "men."

12:04.975 --> 12:06.517
You went "Oasis for... Men."

12:06.602 --> 12:08.012
- Okay. Okay.
- Men. Men.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.099
- Okay, stop it.
- Men! Men!

12:09.188 --> 12:10.812
- Men! Men! Men!
- Stop it!

12:10.898 --> 12:14.017
- Men! Men! Men! Men! Men!
- Stop it! Stop it!

12:14.109 --> 12:17.644
- Men! Men! Men! Men!

12:32.836 --> 12:34.995
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.544
I don't know what happened.

12:37.633 --> 12:41.582
I just... I... I don't know what happened.

12:41.678 --> 12:46.221
Look, I might have come down
on you a little bit hard today. I'm sorry.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.431
I remember pretending
to go look for some socks.

12:48.519 --> 12:52.053
I mean, it's, uh, my fault.
I pushed your buttons.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.354
My father-in-law was the same way
with me. It was horrible.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.232
Grandpa Lucus? He was a sweetheart.

12:56.318 --> 13:00.482
Yeah, after the stroke mellowed
him out good. Before, an animal.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.150
We named Luke after him.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.735
Everything I did was wrong.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.233
If I said it was white,
he'd say it was black.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.911
Although he never said anything was black,
'cause he was a pretty big racist.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.205
- I wear his watch.
- I hated him.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.573
Hated him!

13:13.669 --> 13:17.583
And I was thinking, I don't know...

13:17.673 --> 13:21.207
I don't want you to think
the same way about me.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.216
You ever think about maybe
not being a jerk to me so much?

13:25.305 --> 13:28.223
You see, you got to stop taking
that stuff personally.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.597
I'm like that with everybody.
I'm tough.

13:30.686 --> 13:31.765
And mean.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.846
I don't like to take guff.

13:33.939 --> 13:37.687
- Or people's feelings into consideration.
- Okay, okay.

13:37.776 --> 13:41.227
I can't swear my way is the right way.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.148
I see you smiling, skipping around...

13:43.240 --> 13:46.157
and I think sometimes, I don't know,
maybe the boys would be better off...

13:46.243 --> 13:48.864
if they were a little bit more like you.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.118
You know skipping burns more calories
than running, that's...

13:54.209 --> 13:56.534
We're done here.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.167
Oh, hey, listen. They didn't tell me, but
what did you do to that guy? Did you get him?

14:02.259 --> 14:04.465
- Yeah. I sprayed him with cologne.
- I'm sorry I asked.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.886
No, but like a lot of cologne.
I just like got way up in there.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.844
Good boy.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.813
- Did you find anything yet?
- Yes. There's a whole section on biting on this mommy forum.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.395
Oh, good. What does it say?

14:20.485 --> 14:23.689
"My son was biting,
so I got a stranger to yell at him.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.947
Being disciplined by someone else outside
the family scared him into stopping."

14:27.034 --> 14:28.658
- Idiots!
- Cam.

14:28.744 --> 14:32.991
I am not hiring some hobo to come
over here and traumatize my child.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.288
She's already prone to flashbacks,
if you know what I mean.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.202
Okay, you know she didn't
fight in Vietnam, right?

14:37.294 --> 14:39.370
I don't know anything anymore.
What else does it say?

14:39.463 --> 14:42.001
Okay, well, this one says,
"When my daughter bit her brother...

14:42.090 --> 14:44.249
I put a pinch of pepper in her mouth.

14:44.343 --> 14:48.672
She cried and cried,
but she never bit again." Smiley face.

14:48.764 --> 14:50.673
Oh, well, the smiley face makes it okay.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.304
I waterboarded our toddler. LOL.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.971
All right, what do you suggest we do?

14:55.062 --> 14:59.522
That we log off the Spanish Inquisition
Web site and handle this with love.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.766
Okay, Lily.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.897
# Take a bite of an apple #

15:04.988 --> 15:07.942
# Take a bite of a pear #

15:08.033 --> 15:13.906
# Take a bite of the cookie
that you left over there #

15:13.997 --> 15:16.951
# Here's one thing
you should never do #

15:17.042 --> 15:20.292
# Don't bite Taylor
or Brandon or Sue #

15:20.379 --> 15:23.712
# Because people aren't food
People aren't food #

15:23.799 --> 15:26.883
# Your friends will run away
if they're scared of being chewed #

15:26.969 --> 15:31.049
# And as a side note,
private parts are private ##.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.713
Well, problem solved.

15:33.809 --> 15:37.225
I know you're being sarcastic,
but you don't know that it's not. Ow!

15:37.312 --> 15:38.475
Honey.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.106
- Did she just bite you again?
- No.

15:40.190 --> 15:43.108
- That is it. I am getting the pepper.
- No. No, you are not.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.562
Cam, you're not doing her any favors
by being soft.

15:46.655 --> 15:50.071
Why don't you just skip the pepper, I'll get
some pliers and we'll pull her teeth now!

15:50.158 --> 15:53.574
- Relax. It's a seasoning.
- Okay, well, then, why don't you try some?

15:53.662 --> 15:54.741
- Stop it.
- No, try a little.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.075
- Stop it.
- No, try a little bit.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.623
- Stop it.
- Don't you hit me.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.246
- Stop it.
- Here, put some in there. Ow! You bit me.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.873
Well, why don't you
sing me a song about it.

16:03.922 --> 16:03.964
<i>##  </i>

16:03.964 --> 16:06.669
<i>##  </i>

16:13.515 --> 16:17.430
Oh, look at you two in your matching ties.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.428
- Don't get me started.
- Oh, come here.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.890
- Luke, sweetie, are you wearing cologne?
- No.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.273
Dad attacked the perfume guy
and then hugged me.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.820
Okay.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.478
I saw the boys in those
adorable little suits...

16:30.574 --> 16:33.195
and it made me realize
this dance is about them.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.239
<i>It's not about me</i> <i>and my
petty little competition with...</i>

16:36.330 --> 16:38.121
with Gloria.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.867
<i>##  </i>

16:46.048 --> 16:48.799
Who wears that to a kids' dance?

16:48.884 --> 16:52.253
I know. She looks amazing.

16:52.346 --> 16:57.506
Okay, I'm gonna slow things down with
a blast from the past for our chaperones.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.009
- Give them a hand.
- <i>##  </i>

17:05.901 --> 17:07.608
Oh, my God.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.607
Oh, it's not a problem.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.317
<i># Now I look into your eyes #</i>

17:15.410 --> 17:18.779

17:35.013 --> 17:37.089
I'm fine.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.756
- I don't need a paper towel.
- I'm sorry. I didn't even see you.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.177
No, of course you didn't.
Of course you didn't.

17:42.271 --> 17:43.765
'Cause it's Gloria's night.

17:43.856 --> 17:48.352
That's right.
It's all about Gloria, Gloria, Gloria.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.859
When you're done getting married...

17:51.947 --> 17:54.403
maybe you could mop this up a little.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.861
What was that?

17:56.952 --> 17:58.695
It's this damn uniform.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.365
<i>##  </i>

18:03.792 --> 18:07.161
- Okay, we need to talk.
- No, I am fine. I do not need to talk.

18:07.254 --> 18:11.417
Well, you've been pushing me away the whole week.
You've been fighting all my ideas.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.130
That's because this is
<i>my</i> thing, Gloria.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.173
Why can't it be my thing too, Claire?

18:17.264 --> 18:19.007
Because everything is your thing.

18:19.099 --> 18:22.017
This... This is the one thing
that was my thing.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.471
This is my only thing.
Oh, my God. This is my only thing.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.185
And then you come along
and you steal my thunder...

18:28.275 --> 18:31.192
with your tight dresses
and your great ideas.

18:31.278 --> 18:35.276
I was the one that all the moms looked
up to. I was the only one Gus liked.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.903
Please, if you like him so much,
you can keep him.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.745
It's not the same now
that I know he likes you.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.032
That sounds really insane,
but this isn't actually about Gus.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.829
Really? Because you've been
talking a lot about him.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.199
Gloria, Gus is a symbol.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.214
A sex symbol?

18:51.298 --> 18:53.504
Oh, stop it, Gloria. I'm already crying.

18:53.592 --> 18:55.917
Claire, I didn't come here
to steal your thunder.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.217
Your thunder is your thunder
and my thunder is my thunder.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.923
I know. It's just that God
gave you so much thunder.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.926
Yeah, maybe too much.

19:04.019 --> 19:06.177
I hate how those woman look at me.

19:06.271 --> 19:10.103
You think I don't know what they're thinking?
"Ah, here comes the hot one...

19:10.192 --> 19:12.647
with the big boobies
that is gonna steal my husband."

19:12.736 --> 19:15.523
And maybe they don't
let their kids play with Manny.

19:15.614 --> 19:20.027
I volunteer because I want them to see
that there is so much more to me.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.910
Why didn't you tell me that?

19:21.995 --> 19:26.741
Maybe for the same reason you didn't
tell me you had a weird thing for Gus.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.956
- It's embarrassing.
- Okay.

19:29.044 --> 19:33.955
I am sorry. I made this whole thing
into some ridiculous competition...

19:34.049 --> 19:36.207
and I'm pathetic.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.961
- You're not pathetic.

19:40.681 --> 19:42.969
Okay, that's a little bit sad.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.220
<i> </i>
<i>We like to think we're so smart...</i>

19:47.312 --> 19:49.269

19:49.356 --> 19:52.642
<i>And we want to pass all that</i>
<i>on to our children.</i>

19:52.734 --> 19:55.486
<i>But if you scratch
beneath the surface...</i>

19:55.571 --> 19:58.192
<i>you don't have to dig very deep</i>
<i>to find the kid you were.</i>

19:58.282 --> 20:01.401
<i>Which is why it's kinda crazy</i> <i>that
now we're raising kids of our own.</i>

20:01.493 --> 20:03.153
You know what? This is a milestone.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.818
We're accepting that
our little angel isn't perfect.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.322
That's right, and it's okay.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.036
I... I take it back.

20:12.129 --> 20:13.789
- She is perfect.

<i> </i> <i>I guess that's
the real circle of life.</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:18.165
Your parents faked their way through it...

20:18.260 --> 20:20.549
you fake your way through it...

20:20.637 --> 20:23.923
and hopefully you don't
raise a serial killer.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.347
Ow!

20:30.397 --> 20:31.939
That's not funny.

20:35.027 --> 20:35.068
I am so sorry.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.275
I am so sorry.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.897
No, just come over. We'll watch a movie,
put the whole thing behind you.

20:40.991 --> 20:42.533
Okay, see you in a bit.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.249
