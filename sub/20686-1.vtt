01:40.760 --> 01:42.683

01:46.160 --> 01:49.050
Twenty-six dollars in ones and fives.

01:49.200 --> 01:53.250
One sketchbook, fashion designs. Not bad.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.970
You looked through my sketchbook?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.841

01:57.800 --> 02:00.640
One technical pen and one necklace.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.362

02:05.760 --> 02:07.250
Give you 20 bucks for it.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.006

I forgot to get her something.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.640
You posted my bail.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.566
Not the father-daughter
reunion I dreamt of but...

02:28.760 --> 02:31.411
Good thing for both of us
you're not my father then.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.086
I told you, no matter
how many fosters you throw in front of it,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.049
I'm always going to be your pop.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.765
Gotta say though, it hurt a little you being
back in Motor City and not looking me up.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.247

02:44.000 --> 02:45.365

- Job interview.
- Fashion design?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.006
The guy was a jerk.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.171
He said my work "lacks identity."

02:56.360 --> 02:57.441
Which kind of makes sense,

02:57.600 --> 02:59.568
since I am kind of lacking
in identity myself.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.604
So, you stabbed him
in the hand with a pencil.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.206
No, I stabbed him in the hand with a pen.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.687
And that was only after he suggested
I could have a job, if I gave him one.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.604
Patty would be proud of you for that.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.331

you stood up for yourself.

her chewing me out right now.

(SNIFFLING)

05:13.360 --> 05:15.408
Then why did my mommy give me up?

05:16.320 --> 05:19.688
You were just a baby
when the foster agency placed you with us.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.725
You didn't even have a name.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.245
But you did have something.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.331
Something we've been waiting to give you
until you were old enough.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.688
(GASPING) What is it?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.285
It belonged to your mother.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.287
Chuck asked a friend of his about it
and he said it was an "Anansi Totem."

05:45.440 --> 05:46.441
What's that?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.090
I don't know, sweetie.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.487

it might help you find the answers
to all your questions.

Uh, office hours were over 20 minutes ago.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.241
I'm Mari McCabe. I called earlier.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.360
Of course, my apologies. Come in.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.527
You said you had an artifact
for me to look at.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.609
Yes. Though...

06:22.920 --> 06:24.888
I'm not sure it's an artifact.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.481
Hmm.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.566
MARI: Normally, this is where I'd say,

06:30.720 --> 06:32.051
"My eyes are up here."

06:33.200 --> 06:35.362
This is extraordinary.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.006
Where did you find this?

06:37.280 --> 06:39.442
I guess you could say it's a family heirloom.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.761
I don't really know anything about it.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.564
I... I don't even know where it's from.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.850
That type of stone is indigenous
to the M'Changa province, in Zambesi.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.207
And it has something to do
with "Anansi," right?

06:49.360 --> 06:51.727
Anansi. The trickster god.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.689
According to legend, he fashioned a totem

06:53.840 --> 06:56.047
- which he gave...
- To a warrior named Tantu.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.844
When I was a kid, I looked up
Anansi in the encyclopedia.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.240
I'm sorry to waste your time.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.603

to learn when I came in here.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.250
What did you want to learn?

07:08.080 --> 07:09.650
I don't know. I...

07:09.800 --> 07:10.881
It's stupid.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.883
(SCOFFING) Oh, I have three PhDs so...

07:13.040 --> 07:15.008
How about you let me be
the judge of what's stupid?

07:16.600 --> 07:19.001
I've had this thing since I was 10

07:19.160 --> 07:21.561
and I always thought it was
just a piece of junk jewelry.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.008
But lately, some things have happened to me.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.403
And now, I think it might be the key
to finding out more about my family.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.841
Who's your family?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.931
That would be the $52 million question.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.364
Sorry to waste your time.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.729
It's said the totem grants its
wearer access to the "Ashe"

07:38.880 --> 07:39.927
of the animal kingdom.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.362
It means life force,

07:42.960 --> 07:44.724
power, essence.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.768
The totem harnesses the Ashe
of any animal the wearer conjures up.

07:48.920 --> 07:49.967
What?

07:50.120 --> 07:52.600
You know, speed of a cheetah,

07:52.760 --> 07:54.250
agility of an antelope,

07:54.600 --> 07:56.568
strength of an elephant, etc.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.206
(CHUCKLING) Relax.
All of this is just a myth.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.489
In reality, that pendant is
just a finely polished piece of stone.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.081
Too bad.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.923
If it was magic, I might be able to
get something for it online.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.286

08:19.240 --> 08:21.242
The one who tuned up
the three gang-bangers you hired

08:21.400 --> 08:22.970
to steal the Anansi Totem off her.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.849
She just walked out of my office.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.924
That certainly is a fortunate turn of events.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.009
MACALESTER: I can get her
back here anytime you want.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.286
But in return...

08:31.440 --> 08:33.283
Relax, Dr. Macalester.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.249
Once I have the totem in hand,

08:35.400 --> 08:38.802
you can consider your next
expedition fully funded.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.167

- You think your necklace is magic.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.081
You think I'm crazy?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.287
I don't think you're crazy.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.562
I think the idea that your necklace is magic

09:10.720 --> 09:11.926
might be a little bit crazy.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.162
I know, but, what if it's not?

At least her credit card was
at the Big Belly Burger.

She has a thing for their iceberg shake.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.371
She wasn't in Central City.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.329
That's not possible. What we've seen her do

15:52.480 --> 15:53.481
is not possible.

what you do isn't possible.

What I can do, I think it's magic.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.286
But it's not against the law,

16:02.480 --> 16:04.881

business I am of yours.

can help people like yourself.

- Yes.

No. I'm not sure. I'm...

It's okay. It's okay. What's going on?

It's hard to explain, but, well...

16:51.960 --> 16:53.121
There are two men after me.

- Did you call the police?
- It's not that kind of situation.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.681
I need you to help me find out
where this came from.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.808
How I got it, who gave it to me.

I could help you with any of those things?

I'm really hoping that's the last thing
you're wrong about.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.204
I'm sorry, Mari. I'm very sorry about this.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.324

17:25.520 --> 17:28.842
But your surprising capacity
has given me no choice.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.808

or I will have one of these men kill you.

I'll give it to you right now.

- What?

It's bound itself to you.

Hey, crazy, lunatic lady.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.366
Try to get this.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.363
First, you committed kidnapping.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.882
Second, I was being serious
about giving you the necklace

18:43.040 --> 18:45.884
before you decided to go
all psycho on my ass.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.044
So, we'll figure out a way to
get this thing off my neck

18:49.200 --> 18:50.884
without me losing my neck.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.370
So, you were telling the truth

18:58.520 --> 19:01.171
when you said you just wanted to know
where the totem came from.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.721
Specifically, where I came from.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.211
Who my family is.

- Which is in...
- Africa?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.565
You took me to Africa?

19:41.720 --> 19:43.768
You kidnapped me all the way to Africa?

19:43.920 --> 19:46.890
I'm giving you everything
you asked for, Mari.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.369
I've brought you here because
this is where the totem belongs.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.010
Where you were born.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.488
KUASA: Our people asked
the god Anansi to protect them.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.450
He is known as a trickster,

20:03.840 --> 20:07.401
able to take any shape
he wishes to combat his enemies.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.889
In exchange for our worship,
he gave us a totem to channel his power.

20:12.040 --> 20:16.011
A gift to be passed
from generation to generation.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.681
I was but four when I was chosen.

his men to raid the village

with two things most precious,

the totem and you.

(COOING)

20:47.680 --> 20:50.650
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.883
I was the totem's guardian.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.964
It was my responsibility
to see that our village

20:56.120 --> 20:57.531
did not come to harm.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.604
That's horrible.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.322
but it is still my home,

21:06.480 --> 21:09.882
still my sacred obligation to protect it.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.486
From who?

21:11.640 --> 21:14.530
There's... There's nothing left.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.241
There is responsibility, even to the dead.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.882
Especially to the dead.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.771
Okay.

Obviously, there's a whole
lot I don't understand here.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.200
Without the totem, I had to strike bargains

21:28.360 --> 21:31.011
with others who also craved its power.

21:32.560 --> 21:36.565
So, when I found out you had the totem,
I had to come after it.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.885
The totem sensed me.
That's why it came alive for you.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.044
Unfortunately, it also bonded with you.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.528
And there is only one way
to sever that connection

21:47.800 --> 21:49.131
What are you...

21:49.280 --> 21:50.611
I'm very sorry.

21:50.760 --> 21:56.688
We've only just been reunited,
but my first obligation is to Zambesi.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.921
You understand.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.890
A spokesperson for the museum confirmed

49:17.080 --> 49:19.481
that an unspecified number
of gemstones were stolen,

49:19.680 --> 49:21.682
including the museum's most recent addition,

49:21.840 --> 49:23.524
the lost totem of Zambesi.

Totem. It has more historic
than pecuniary value.

It looks like a ruby,
but it's actually a tourmaline,

50:11.640 --> 50:12.880

57:35.840 --> 57:37.649
He has the Zambesi fire totem.

57:37.880 --> 57:41.646

until both totems are in his hands.

doesn't trust you as much as you thought.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.802
Better hold on tight. She's slippery.

you don't think I'd make it waterproof?

Happy to help.

which means we need your help to stop him.

Good evening, people of Detroit.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.403
My name is Benatu Eshu.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.331
As of this message,
I am no longer a representative

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.050

But one woman has it
within her power to stop this apocalypse.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.286
She knows what she possesses.
And she knows that I want it.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.291
And when it is mine, the death will end.

Really not a good time.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.850
I found a song in the archives.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.840
It says each totem has a center. Its ore.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.411
It's like a soul.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.291
If you crush the soul,
the totem will lose its power.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.485
Okay, I'll just ask Eshu
if I can borrow his totem for a minute.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.563
If anyone can do this, it's you.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.884
You were meant for this battle, Mari.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.966
I think your fiery buddy
wants to get your attention.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.246

As you burn, try to remember that I wanted
to handle this as human beings.

He doesn't exactly come across
as an expert in that field.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.842
Dad, you need to run.
Find a shelter, stay away from this.

How did he find us?

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.770
Maybe because we're wearing costumes.
