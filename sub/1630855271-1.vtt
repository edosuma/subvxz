10:18.998 --> 10:21.328

12:05.290 --> 12:08.894

15:11.424 --> 15:14.591
Are you gonna smoke with me or what?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.285
Whatever.

15:22.348 --> 15:24.765
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

15:25.928 --> 15:28.761
I have never really smoked before.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.754
I could teach you.

15:32.754 --> 15:34.921
Let me teach you, come on.

15:37.255 --> 15:38.488
Okay, but can we hurry?

15:38.488 --> 15:40.704
I don't want the police to pull up on us.

15:40.704 --> 15:42.368
Ain't nobody gonna fuckin' lock you up

15:42.368 --> 15:46.076
for smoking pot in fucking
Southern California.

15:46.076 --> 15:47.844
Let me teach you.

15:47.844 --> 15:51.600
All you gotta do is hold it like this.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.433
Put your thumb over that and
inhale when I light the fire.

16:06.597 --> 16:11.430
You about to be fucked up.

17:53.641 --> 17:55.224
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

17:56.081 --> 17:59.068
I'm getting you wet and I
didn't even ask your name.

17:59.068 --> 18:00.485
It's, uh, Elon.

18:03.197 --> 18:05.935
Elon?

18:05.935 --> 18:07.185
Like Elon Musk?

18:08.093 --> 18:11.424
Damn bitch, you were raised
by white people, huh?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.231
In the fuckin' hills
and everything, right?

18:14.231 --> 18:15.251
Funny.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.419
And what should I call you?

18:18.419 --> 18:19.804
Stony hitchhiker?

18:19.804 --> 18:24.559
Mm, you could call me that
or you could call me Bora.

18:24.559 --> 18:26.747
And don't you forget that shit

18:26.747 --> 18:31.747
because I'm only gonna
tell you one time.

18:32.052 --> 18:33.379
Hey!

18:33.379 --> 18:36.583
What are your Black bitches
doing swimming to my pool?

18:43.095 --> 18:44.717
What the fuck did you just call us?

18:44.717 --> 18:46.913
You're trespassing on private property.

18:46.913 --> 18:50.553
You're lucky I don't call the police.

18:50.553 --> 18:51.636
The police?

18:52.487 --> 18:54.425
Are you serious?

18:54.425 --> 18:58.761
Sir, we're just young girls
trying to enjoy our summer.

18:58.761 --> 19:03.068
You were young once, right?

19:03.068 --> 19:04.211
If I'd known it was gonna be like this,

19:04.211 --> 19:06.484
I would've had your friend stay.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.374
I can't believe the guy
didn't call the cops on us.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.775
Yeah, I gave him a fake
number and he let us go.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.322
Aye, you know what we should do?

19:31.322 --> 19:35.607
You should let me show you
LA before we go to Monterey.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.027
But I live here.

19:37.027 --> 19:39.933
Yeah, but I can tell
you don't get out much.

19:39.933 --> 19:42.643
And besides my daddy was a straight cholo.

19:42.643 --> 19:46.615
So I can show us the
best of both worlds, ma.

19:46.615 --> 19:49.365
Okay, I guess that can be cool.

20:10.814 --> 20:13.496
You need anything out of here?

20:13.496 --> 20:15.344
Maybe some waters.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.261
Say less.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.919
You think I can't see you or somethin'?

21:33.919 --> 21:35.315
I'm shopping, what does
it look like I'm doing?

21:35.315 --> 21:37.645
No, shopping is when you pay.

21:37.645 --> 21:40.944
Now you gonna pay for them
little waters you got or, uh,

21:40.944 --> 21:41.777
I'm gonna have to come over there

21:41.777 --> 21:43.299

21:43.299 --> 21:45.315
No, I'm not paying for the waters.

21:45.315 --> 21:47.270
And I don't even know these fools.

21:47.270 --> 21:49.483
And besides, why would I pay for water?

21:49.483 --> 21:50.760
Water is a natural resource.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.200
Nobody should ever have to pay for waters.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.140
She right.

21:55.140 --> 21:55.973
- What?
- She right.

21:55.973 --> 21:57.103
Get with the times, fool.

21:57.103 --> 21:59.032
Hey, hey, I'm not playing with you.

21:59.032 --> 21:59.865
Wait-

21:59.865 --> 22:00.883
Hey!

22:00.883 --> 22:01.996
- Okay, okay.
- Hey, stop playin'.

22:01.996 --> 22:02.977
Get with the times.

22:02.977 --> 22:04.704
Ay, free water.
You see this shit?

22:04.704 --> 22:06.987
She's right, she's right.

22:06.987 --> 22:09.272
She right. Little short right there right.

22:09.272 --> 22:10.808
You know what I'm sayin'?

22:10.808 --> 22:12.958
- Grady, what the fuck, man?
- Hey.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.224
I paid for your mixtape.

22:14.224 --> 22:16.028
Man, now I feel disrespected.

22:16.028 --> 22:17.568
That was two years, ago, bro.

22:18.401 --> 22:19.234
Man, give me a blunt.

22:19.234 --> 22:20.067
Give me a Swisher, too, man.

22:20.067 --> 22:21.524
Man, I ain't givin'
you shit. Knock it off.

22:21.524 --> 22:22.357
Free water.

22:22.357 --> 22:25.376
Hey, put that beer right
there too and some blunts.

22:25.376 --> 22:27.104
Where the hell that girl go, dog?

22:27.104 --> 22:27.937
Hey, baby.

22:27.937 --> 22:28.770
Where you goin' baby?

22:28.770 --> 22:30.228
Hey. Damn.

22:31.741 --> 22:35.265
Oh, that ain't buyin',
it's enlightening.

22:35.265 --> 22:36.098
Mm-mm-mm.

22:36.978 --> 22:39.874
Matter of fact, natural resource.

22:39.874 --> 22:42.182
We gonna do this the
easy way or the hard way?

22:42.182 --> 22:44.626
Man, don't you even try it, bruh.

22:44.626 --> 22:46.178
You already know what time it is, man.

22:46.178 --> 22:48.485
You sayin' that like I give fuck.

22:49.405 --> 22:52.192
Matter of fact, give me a bag.

22:52.192 --> 22:53.775
Give me a bag, bro.

22:54.905 --> 22:56.130
Damn.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.674
Because of that, I ain't
gonna pop your ass,

22:57.674 --> 22:59.902
but I'm walking out of
here with this water.

22:59.902 --> 23:02.781
'Cause it's hot and we thirsty.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.734
Yo, I'm gonna remember this shit, man.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.102
I know where you live.

23:06.102 --> 23:07.248
I know where your mama live.

23:07.248 --> 23:08.173
Come find me.

23:08.173 --> 23:11.186
My mama down with the shit, too.

23:11.186 --> 23:13.118
Yo, nigga, that's that bullshit.

23:13.118 --> 23:15.644
I'ma, you think I'm playin'?

23:15.644 --> 23:16.477
I got-

23:16.477 --> 23:19.666
Hey, your son down here
actin' a goddamn monkey.

23:19.666 --> 23:20.922
Yeah, I'ma need that pistol back, too.

23:20.922 --> 23:22.714
This bat ain't doin' shit.

23:22.714 --> 23:24.206
And call the po-po.

23:24.206 --> 23:25.413
Hey!

23:25.413 --> 23:28.496
You better not tell her.

23:30.930 --> 23:32.263
Thanks.

23:35.064 --> 23:36.619
No way.

23:37.603 --> 23:39.151
What?

23:39.151 --> 23:40.712
What's up?

23:40.712 --> 23:42.295
- Hey.
- What it do?

23:43.847 --> 23:45.995
You wanna cruise with us?

23:45.995 --> 23:46.828
Um...

23:47.747 --> 23:49.627
No, it's okay.

23:49.627 --> 23:50.751
Why not?

23:50.751 --> 23:52.448
- Your car's cool, though.
- Yeah?

23:52.448 --> 23:54.335
You said you were
gonna let me show you LA.

23:54.335 --> 23:55.168
Yeah.

23:57.031 --> 23:57.864
Come on.

23:57.864 --> 24:00.128
For all we know, they
robbed the liquor store.

24:00.128 --> 24:01.350
Say who?

24:01.350 --> 24:03.483
They would never do something like that.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.611
Those waters are free.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.639
Come on.

24:06.639 --> 24:07.618
At least let me, you know,

24:07.618 --> 24:09.796
cruise with you, show you around.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.500
Let me show you what's up.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.504
Where you gotta be?

24:13.504 --> 24:14.372
Where you gotta be?

24:14.372 --> 24:16.783
Mm-hm, where? With us.

24:16.783 --> 24:18.183
Come on.

24:18.183 --> 24:19.016
Let's go.

24:19.016 --> 24:21.766

about 'em earlier, though.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.133
Why you so quiet, ma?

26:27.988 --> 26:30.684
Ah, come on. This is the fuckin' life.

26:30.684 --> 26:32.351
Look at that sunset.

26:35.656 --> 26:40.489
It's like everything just
feels super intense right now.

26:42.592 --> 26:46.418
It's like, like the road is
a treadmill or something.

26:46.418 --> 26:50.835
We're going really fast but
we're not going anywhere.

26:54.210 --> 26:57.739
That's a combination
of this strong ass kush

26:57.739 --> 27:02.195
we just smoked and freedom.

27:02.195 --> 27:04.366
You're free, bitch.

27:04.366 --> 27:07.635
Free to say what you
want, do what you want.

27:07.635 --> 27:09.468
Fuck whoever you want.

27:10.446 --> 27:12.120
In fucking public, if you want to.

27:13.644 --> 27:17.273
I don't know about the
fucking whoever you want part.

27:17.273 --> 27:18.856
Ah, let me guess.

27:20.452 --> 27:22.119
You got a boyfriend?

27:23.136 --> 27:25.840
And I'm guessing you don't?

27:26.924 --> 27:29.853
Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

27:29.853 --> 27:31.576
Why the fuck would any
logical thinking woman

27:31.576 --> 27:32.576
wanna do it?

27:33.436 --> 27:34.436
A boyfriend?

27:35.516 --> 27:38.696
And what the fuck does
that shit even mean anyway?

27:38.696 --> 27:40.828
He's a boy, which means he's not a man,

27:40.828 --> 27:42.822
which means he has no idea what the fuck

27:42.822 --> 27:46.792
he wants to do with his life
other than control his bitch,

27:46.792 --> 27:50.468
which in this case will be you, Elon.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.575
And don't let him be under 40 years old,

27:52.575 --> 27:55.091
'cause that means his credit is fucked up.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.884
Which means that you're the only thing

27:56.884 --> 27:58.634
he can afford to own.

27:59.939 --> 28:03.710
And if he's just a friend,
like the name implies,

28:03.710 --> 28:08.316
that means he can walk
outta your life at any time.

28:08.316 --> 28:11.149
The man gets to lie, cheat, steal,

28:12.208 --> 28:14.657
collect women like trophies.

28:14.657 --> 28:18.050
And society always takes
him back, you know why?

28:18.050 --> 28:19.633
Because he's a man.

28:20.957 --> 28:24.966
So why should I gift my
beautiful, golden pussy

28:24.966 --> 28:27.849
to just one, and for free?

28:27.849 --> 28:29.785
Fuck that shit.

28:29.785 --> 28:31.702
Pussy rules everything.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.704
You know it, I know it.

28:36.704 --> 28:38.537
They all know it, too.

28:39.854 --> 28:42.225
Hey, I play the game.

28:42.225 --> 28:43.225
I play nice.

28:44.509 --> 28:49.426
But at the end of the day, you
know what I really wanna do?

28:50.679 --> 28:55.128
Every time a motherfucker
asks me to make him dinner,

28:55.128 --> 28:59.037
I wanna cut off his dick
and I wanna chop it up

28:59.037 --> 29:02.181
into a thousand little pieces.

29:02.181 --> 29:05.813
Then I wanna sprinkle it in a soup.

29:05.813 --> 29:08.146
Then I wanna feed it to him,

29:10.637 --> 29:14.137
just before I put on my red bottoms,

29:14.137 --> 29:16.804
walk over to him real slow-like,

29:18.361 --> 29:21.512
and kick him where I used to be.

29:21.512 --> 29:23.806
And if I'm feeling merciful,
I pull out my pistol

29:23.806 --> 29:28.806
and put him out of his misery.

29:29.332 --> 29:33.107
Ah, come on.

29:33.107 --> 29:34.107
I'm kidding.

29:35.867 --> 29:39.461
Dang, girl.

29:39.461 --> 29:43.075
It sounds like you've been through a lot.

29:43.075 --> 29:46.207
But my man's one of the good ones.

29:46.207 --> 29:48.556
You just gotta ask God to heal your heart

29:48.556 --> 29:51.947
and make room for your soulmate.

29:51.947 --> 29:55.247
There's gotta be someone
out there for you.

29:55.247 --> 29:57.831
There are no good ones, bitch.

29:59.773 --> 30:03.171
They're just getting better at
lying 'cause of the internet.

30:03.171 --> 30:06.454
The information is
traveling faster, that's it.

30:06.454 --> 30:07.371
But even if that's the case,

30:07.371 --> 30:11.548
joking about chopping
someone's dick off is a lot.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.131
Why not just leave?

30:15.806 --> 30:20.306
If we just leave, how they
gonna learn their lesson?

30:23.795 --> 30:28.128
They don't give us respect,
we gotta take that shit.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.021
Good ones?

30:33.021 --> 30:34.688
You're funny, bitch.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.709
I hope you
don't wait until the last minute

30:59.709 --> 31:01.981
to get your costume, 'cause LA is about

31:01.981 --> 31:04.534
to be lit this Halloween weekend.

31:04.534 --> 31:06.119
I'm kind of glad we're stopping

31:06.119 --> 31:07.032
'cause I really need to sober up

31:07.032 --> 31:09.403
before we get back on the road.

31:09.403 --> 31:11.091
Do you believe in God, Elon?

31:11.091 --> 31:13.040
Of course, why?

31:13.040 --> 31:14.323
Then pray and ask him to get us

31:14.323 --> 31:17.190
into this motherfuckin' party, bitch.

31:17.190 --> 31:18.023
Bora.

31:18.023 --> 31:18.856
What's up, family?

31:18.856 --> 31:19.802
- What's good, my guy?
- Big respect.

31:19.802 --> 31:20.733
Knock out artist.

31:20.733 --> 31:21.566
Appreciate it, appreciate it.

31:21.566 --> 31:22.918
I got me and my wife.
Y'all good.

31:22.918 --> 31:24.649
All right. Oh yeah, by the way.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.460
Who you got? Spence or Pacquiao?

31:26.460 --> 31:27.646
Spence, all day, homie.

31:27.646 --> 31:28.479
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:28.479 --> 31:29.638
All day, homie.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.560
- You gotta-
- Listen.

31:30.560 --> 31:31.393
I'm so sorry.

31:31.393 --> 31:32.669
You got ass, I got titties.

31:32.669 --> 31:37.006
We should have no problem
getting into this place.

31:37.006 --> 31:37.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:37.839 --> 31:39.742
Where the fuck y'all think y'all goin'?

31:39.742 --> 31:41.118
Ah, come on, bro.

31:42.598 --> 31:44.462
Damn, how much?

31:44.462 --> 31:47.144
Who you guys know up in here, huh?

31:47.144 --> 31:48.537
Mount Rushmore.

31:48.537 --> 31:49.903
Mount Rushmore?

31:49.903 --> 31:51.718
That ain't enough for Mount Rushmore.

31:51.718 --> 31:54.854
But it's the start though. I'll take it.

31:54.854 --> 31:56.354
I just have to use the bathroom.

31:56.354 --> 31:57.546
Y'all got shit fucked up.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.982

motherfuckin' gas station?

31:59.982 --> 32:01.346
Hey, check it out. It goes like this.

32:01.346 --> 32:03.694
If you guys don't know anybody up in here,

32:03.694 --> 32:05.394

32:05.394 --> 32:07.329

32:07.329 --> 32:08.260

32:08.260 --> 32:09.636
Straight up.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.829
What about these guys?

32:11.829 --> 32:13.961
- What's good, homie?
- You know these girls?

32:13.961 --> 32:15.152
- Sure.
- All right.

32:15.152 --> 32:17.192
You sure? They with you?

32:17.192 --> 32:19.038
All right, let 'em slide in.

fucking questions, understand?

41:18.267 --> 41:19.887
Even if they don't make sense?

41:19.887 --> 41:22.764
You got any drugs, weapons,
animals in the vehicle?

41:22.764 --> 41:24.421
Animals? What the fuck, bro?

41:24.421 --> 41:26.179
Like why are you asking
her those questions?

41:26.179 --> 41:27.012
I'm the one driving.

41:27.012 --> 41:29.096
Look, we've had reports
a theft in the area

41:29.096 --> 41:31.623
and you look like the suspect.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.123
License and registration, now.

41:36.387 --> 41:37.473
Put your hands-
Whoa!

41:37.473 --> 41:38.571
Where I can see 'em!

41:38.571 --> 41:42.180
Put your hands on the dash right now!

41:42.180 --> 41:45.015
Look, okay, so you
asked for her license,

41:45.015 --> 41:46.075
then she went for her license

41:46.075 --> 41:46.931
and now you're freaking out,

41:46.931 --> 41:50.299
so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna grab her license

41:50.299 --> 41:52.231
and I'm gonna hand it to you, okay?

41:52.231 --> 41:55.471
All right, I want you
to take your two fingers

41:55.471 --> 41:57.943
and give me her license right now.

41:57.943 --> 42:02.567
Give it to me between the
two fingers, right here.

42:02.567 --> 42:03.631
Hand it right here.

42:03.631 --> 42:05.155
Right fuckin' here.

42:05.155 --> 42:08.155
And you don't fucking move one inch.

42:20.359 --> 42:22.192
You good, ma?

42:22.192 --> 42:23.775
No, I'm not good.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.671
I told you you were speeding
and you thought I was joking.

42:27.671 --> 42:30.615
That guy was gonna pull us
over no matter what we did.

42:30.615 --> 42:34.139
I was only going five
miles over the speed limit.

42:34.139 --> 42:36.079
Look, I'm sorry I almost got us killed.

42:36.079 --> 42:36.912
Us?

42:37.894 --> 42:40.311
No, you almost got me killed.

42:45.375 --> 42:49.385
What's taking him so long with my license?

42:55.259 --> 42:57.251
I fuckin' hate that shit.

43:00.351 --> 43:02.335
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

43:02.335 --> 43:03.972
I'm gonna go talk to him, okay?

43:03.972 --> 43:06.604
What? Are you crazy?

43:06.604 --> 43:08.578
He'll shoot you.

43:08.578 --> 43:11.744
Just, just please don't go, Bora.

43:11.744 --> 43:12.661
I'm scared.

43:13.594 --> 43:17.181
You know what I do when I'm
feeling scared or anxiety?

43:17.181 --> 43:19.431
I listen to relaxing music.

43:20.554 --> 43:23.996
Here, this is my
meditation playlist, okay?

43:23.996 --> 43:28.996
Put it on, take a deep
breath and just try to relax.

43:29.102 --> 43:30.383
Okay?

43:30.383 --> 43:32.631
It's gonna be fine.

43:32.631 --> 43:33.551
I promise.

43:33.551 --> 43:35.134
I'll be back, okay?

43:41.171 --> 43:42.171
Don't worry.

43:47.178 --> 43:48.161

Well he said that situations like this

44:32.067 --> 44:35.150

45:41.991 --> 45:43.750
So what are we dealing? Christmas cards?

45:44.979 --> 45:48.100
See, I told you all that seasonal shit

45:48.100 --> 45:51.253
wasn't gonna work.

45:51.253 --> 45:52.735
Come on, Chino.

45:52.735 --> 45:54.539
It's me, baby.

45:54.539 --> 45:56.583
I ain't never been a day
late or a dollar shot.

45:56.583 --> 45:59.184
So why you asking me for more time?

45:59.184 --> 46:02.115
See nigga, you fucked up.

46:02.115 --> 46:05.638
That ego shit will get
you killed every time.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.435
I need four days.

46:07.435 --> 46:10.289
What's that, like 69 hours?

46:10.289 --> 46:14.235
Actually, big homie, I was
crunching the numbers, right?

46:14.235 --> 46:16.568
And it's about 76 hours. 76.

46:18.102 --> 46:19.241
Nah, nah, nah, look.

46:19.241 --> 46:22.658
Hey Siri, how many hours is in four days?

46:24.679 --> 46:26.148
Four days is 96 hours.

46:26.148 --> 46:28.912
See, I told you, dumbass.

46:28.912 --> 46:30.912
Man, shut the fuck up.

46:31.910 --> 46:34.390
You know much money I make in four days?

46:34.390 --> 46:36.332
You know how much money I make in a day?

46:36.332 --> 46:37.582
In an hour? Hm?

46:38.762 --> 46:39.773
How much?

46:39.773 --> 46:41.978
More than your fuckin' life.

46:41.978 --> 46:46.093
Listen, by looking at
him, looking at this place,

46:46.093 --> 46:48.326
it's about $100,000 a day.

46:48.326 --> 46:50.743
Aye, let me smoke this nigga.

46:51.611 --> 46:52.959
Get me your motherfuckin' gun.

46:52.959 --> 46:54.376
Give me your gun.

46:55.422 --> 46:56.701
Hold the gun.

46:57.774 --> 47:01.542
Give me the fuckin' gun. Give me the gun.

47:01.542 --> 47:03.709
Two days. Two days, Chino.

47:04.926 --> 47:06.093
Nah.

47:07.373 --> 47:12.373
You gonna get that bread
to me by 12 noon tomorrow.

47:31.310 --> 47:32.143
Hey Vinny.

47:34.957 --> 47:39.254
I like that white couch your
wife got for the living room.

47:39.254 --> 47:42.587
It'd be a real shame to get blood on it.

48:23.139 --> 48:25.056
Gonna be long?

48:25.935 --> 48:27.465
Maybe.

48:27.465 --> 48:28.298
Maybe not.

48:30.290 --> 48:33.707
Why, are you gonna miss me when I'm gone?

48:35.949 --> 48:36.866
Hey wait.

48:42.611 --> 48:44.651
Don't leave me by myself.

48:44.651 --> 48:49.001
I'm not gonna leave you,
unless you wanna be left.

48:49.001 --> 48:50.456
Ah.

48:50.456 --> 48:52.053
What's even in there?

48:52.053 --> 48:54.497
Prostitutes and drugs.

48:54.497 --> 48:57.816
You're joking, right?

49:06.925 --> 49:08.640
What's up, fucker?

49:08.640 --> 49:09.913
Bora.

49:09.913 --> 49:11.797
Fuck you doing in my
hood this time of night?

49:11.797 --> 49:14.100
Oh, you know
pussy don't sleep, nigga.

49:14.100 --> 49:16.513
See, that's why I like her.

49:16.513 --> 49:17.689
The realest bitch I know.

49:17.689 --> 49:18.524
Yeah, all right,

49:18.524 --> 49:21.524
watch your mouth, though, all right?

49:23.837 --> 49:25.170
Um, excuse me?

49:26.575 --> 49:29.972
Sorry to interrupt, but
can I use your restroom?

49:29.972 --> 49:31.261
What the fuck?

49:31.261 --> 49:33.577
The fuck you think
this is? A gas station.

49:33.577 --> 49:35.494
It's just a restroom.

49:36.913 --> 49:37.746
Yeah.

49:40.137 --> 49:42.137
- Thank you.
- Bitch, go.

49:43.586 --> 49:45.825
I'll be a minute.

49:45.825 --> 49:48.325
We heard you the first time.

49:51.055 --> 49:53.947
So what's on the menu tonight?

49:53.947 --> 49:56.114
Anything you like, baby.

49:57.728 --> 49:59.984
I didn't come here for you, Chino.

49:59.984 --> 50:02.897
But you got what I like, though.

50:02.897 --> 50:05.372
♪ Real recognize real,
never fuck with fakes ♪

50:05.372 --> 50:08.049
♪ Be on the lookout for them
boys, stay away from J ♪

50:08.049 --> 50:10.849
♪ Keep your side all business,
you can test the fates ♪

50:16.763 --> 50:21.133
Wrapped long and thick,
just like you like it.

50:21.133 --> 50:22.909
Yeah, that's right, Chino.

50:22.909 --> 50:26.409
Ain't nothin' but long and
thick up in here tonight.

50:26.409 --> 50:27.819
Well it looks like the stroke game

50:27.819 --> 50:30.068
is a little weak tonight.

50:30.068 --> 50:32.234
What you mean weak? It ain't never weak.

50:32.234 --> 50:36.287
Hey, don't come up here
talking shit, you hear?

50:36.287 --> 50:38.516
Hey, hey, it's Bora. La familia.

50:38.516 --> 50:40.179
I don't give a fuck who it is.

50:40.179 --> 50:41.077
She ain't gonna be coming up here

50:41.077 --> 50:42.581
talking about our stroke game weak.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.561
We can't risk that shit
getting out in these streets.

50:44.561 --> 50:45.394
Weak.

50:46.283 --> 50:47.808
Light.

50:47.808 --> 50:51.000
Whatever the fuck it is,
when I come to you Chino,

50:51.000 --> 50:54.833
you know I usually get
double for that amount.

50:55.981 --> 50:58.981
Well, you ever heard of inflation?

51:01.763 --> 51:02.763
Inflation?

51:05.013 --> 51:07.807
I tell you what we're gonna do, hm?

51:08.852 --> 51:11.761
We're gonna take less, and so are you.

51:14.433 --> 51:15.479
Familia.

51:16.714 --> 51:18.973
How about you take double

51:18.973 --> 51:20.957
and then you leave that
chocolate ass here for me.

51:22.218 --> 51:23.915
Don't lust after
things you can't afford.

51:23.915 --> 51:24.824
Yeah, whatever, bitch.

51:26.381 --> 51:27.214
Suck this.

51:33.549 --> 51:36.533
Better be careful,
man. Bora's a bad bitch.

51:54.517 --> 51:55.350
Okay.

51:57.066 --> 51:58.634
Calm down, Elon. Calm down.

51:58.634 --> 52:00.483
Just breathe, just breathe.

52:00.483 --> 52:03.441
It's just drugs out there.

52:03.441 --> 52:04.979
There's drugs out there.

52:04.979 --> 52:07.342
What did Bora get me into?

52:11.223 --> 52:13.056
You have to calm down.

52:14.208 --> 52:15.619
It's just drugs out there.

52:24.928 --> 52:27.178
Everything's gonna be okay.

52:28.636 --> 52:29.469
Okay.

52:35.617 --> 52:36.950
It's just drugs.

53:50.092 --> 53:52.259
I like your dress.

53:54.251 --> 53:55.084
Thank you.

53:55.084 --> 53:56.394
Yeah, yeah you're welcome.

53:56.394 --> 53:58.084
You look good in it, you know.

53:58.084 --> 54:00.214
Even with those black stockings,

54:00.214 --> 54:02.552
I can tell you fine, girl.

54:02.552 --> 54:03.936
Just 'cause you're fine don't mean you get

54:03.936 --> 54:06.066
to go through people's shit.

54:06.066 --> 54:09.066
Um, I was just getting some water.

54:11.268 --> 54:12.824
Can I, is, is that okay?

54:12.824 --> 54:13.923
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:13.923 --> 54:15.469
You're thirsty, right?

54:15.469 --> 54:16.302
Yeah.

54:17.988 --> 54:19.405
I'm thirsty, too.

54:21.436 --> 54:25.441
But unfortunately nothing in life is free.

54:25.441 --> 54:26.984
Not even water.
You know it's-

54:26.984 --> 54:30.419
But, but, but I'm feeling generous

54:30.419 --> 54:32.675
and since I like chocolate,

54:32.675 --> 54:35.036
I'm gonna give you a
little discount, you hear?

54:35.869 --> 54:36.702
Stop.

54:38.996 --> 54:39.829
No, stop.

55:24.159 --> 55:26.095
Hey, love. What was your homeboy's name?

55:26.095 --> 55:29.574
Hmm? The one who grabbed
my girl's cho-cha?

55:29.574 --> 55:31.866
That's Christos.

55:31.866 --> 55:33.536
Christos, like Jesus Cristo?

55:33.536 --> 55:37.619
No, because Christos
grabs and grabs and grabs.

55:40.271 --> 55:42.047
Does Christos have a mother?

55:42.047 --> 55:44.479
I don't know what the bastard gots.

55:44.479 --> 55:46.229
You gonna tell on him?

55:46.229 --> 55:48.034
No, but you can tell her

55:48.034 --> 55:51.201
I said I'm sorry for her fucking loss.

55:52.103 --> 55:52.936
Oh.

55:54.175 --> 55:56.008
So this what we doin'?

55:57.243 --> 55:59.380
What's good, vato?

55:59.380 --> 56:03.963
If I gotta die, that means
everybody gotta fuckin' die.

56:11.073 --> 56:11.906
Okay.

56:15.095 --> 56:17.711
You ain't gonna shoot me.

56:17.711 --> 56:19.128
You ain't stupid.

56:21.703 --> 56:24.979
But I guess Christos deserved that.

56:24.979 --> 56:29.312
Got something for you.

56:32.760 --> 56:34.927
That should make it right.

56:35.951 --> 56:38.943
Hey ma, you ever seen
a dead body before, hm?

56:38.943 --> 56:40.103
Go look in the fuckin' kitchen.

56:40.103 --> 56:43.227
Hey, fuck you, Bora.
All this over some blow?

56:43.227 --> 56:44.727
Hm?

56:44.727 --> 56:47.583
Big Tio ain't gonna like this shit.

56:47.583 --> 56:52.539
You gonna have every ese
in LA gunning for your ass.

56:52.539 --> 56:54.660
This ain't about blow.

56:54.660 --> 56:56.674
This is about respect.

56:56.674 --> 56:59.371
So let them come, fucker.

57:09.813 --> 57:10.646
Whoa.

57:11.793 --> 57:13.293
That was dramatic.

57:17.035 --> 57:18.793
Okay, I gotta tell you
who you remind me of

57:18.793 --> 57:19.777
with this mask on.

57:19.777 --> 57:22.698
So there's a bitch down on Crenshaw-

57:22.698 --> 57:25.088
Matter of fact, I
saw her just the other day.

57:25.088 --> 57:26.217
You did?

57:26.217 --> 57:27.302
Okay, what did she say?

57:27.302 --> 57:31.264
Because she told me that I
should go to her shop but,

57:32.097 --> 57:34.156
I don't have money.

57:34.156 --> 57:37.132
She told me to
tell you that she heard

57:37.132 --> 57:40.016
there was a secret stash of secret cash

57:40.016 --> 57:42.842
somewhere in this house
and that you can have

57:42.842 --> 57:46.704
all the blow in this place if
you just tell me where it is.

57:46.704 --> 57:47.836
All right.

57:47.836 --> 57:50.336
Okay, so el dinero is upstairs

57:52.936 --> 57:55.265
in the apartment underneath the big bed.

57:55.265 --> 57:57.598

01:00:21.676 --> 01:00:23.296

You're a fucking psycho.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.648
I should have never picked you up.

01:00:36.648 --> 01:00:37.481
You know what?

01:00:37.481 --> 01:00:39.485
I didn't know that little girls

01:00:39.485 --> 01:00:44.318
that wear leggings under
sundresses use so much profanity.

01:00:45.428 --> 01:00:47.960
What is wrong with you?

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.281
We could have just bounced and what?

01:00:50.281 --> 01:00:52.631
Now you're trying to flee
the murder scene in my car?

01:00:52.631 --> 01:00:54.923
It's not like they're
gonna come after us.

01:00:54.923 --> 01:00:57.060
They're dead, okay?

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.143
They're dead.

01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:01.591
You know what?

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:05.829
You can have the car and everything in it.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.953
I'll, I'll just walk.

01:01:07.953 --> 01:01:11.011
I'll walk and I'll report
the car stolen in a few days

01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:12.939
and you can have it all.

01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:14.487
I don't, I don't want it.

01:01:14.487 --> 01:01:17.327
Now why would you wanna
do a thing like that?

01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:19.744
Why would anybody wanna do
a thing like that, Elon?

01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:21.930
Someone is gonna come after us

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:23.580
and I don't wanna die or go to jail

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.163
for something that you
have us mixed up in.

01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:30.241
This has nothing to do with me.

01:01:30.241 --> 01:01:33.221
This got nothing to do with you?

01:01:33.221 --> 01:01:36.862
That fool and his homie
were gonna fuckin' rape you.

01:01:36.862 --> 01:01:38.802
They were gonna put a pistol to your head

01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:40.439
and they were gonna record it

01:01:40.439 --> 01:01:44.391
and it was gonna be
#CoCoPussy all over Instagram.

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:48.966
I fuckin' saved your life
and your reputation, huh?

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:51.044
I did what had to be done.

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.798
Besides, look around you Elon.

01:01:52.798 --> 01:01:55.215
You see anybody following us?

01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:59.779
You see any five-ohs?

01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:02.646
Because I saw a couple
but they kept driving.

01:02:02.646 --> 01:02:03.729
You know why?

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:08.825
Because all I see is open
roads and opportunities.

01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:12.522
Open roads and clear skies.

01:02:13.498 --> 01:02:14.436
Get in the car.

01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:15.269
No.

01:02:16.244 --> 01:02:18.077
- Get in the car.
- No.

01:02:19.594 --> 01:02:21.662
You can have it.

01:02:21.662 --> 01:02:24.030
I'm not doing this.

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:25.197
Ah, come on.

01:02:26.721 --> 01:02:30.721
You're gonna make me spend
this money by myself?

01:02:54.057 --> 01:02:58.189
Are you trying to fuck
with my emotions right now?

01:02:58.189 --> 01:03:02.022
Did you ever walk 85
miles before, Elon? Hm?

01:03:03.102 --> 01:03:04.781
Because that's how long
it's gonna take you

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.781
to get to the next town.

01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:12.738
I noticed you were walking that way

01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:15.321
and I'm driving that way, so...

01:03:26.354 --> 01:03:27.910
And that's where you're
supposed to be like,

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:32.178
"Oh, I don't think my daddy
wants me talking to strangers."

01:03:32.178 --> 01:03:37.178
And then I was like, "Oh, but
you're a soldier of the Lord."

01:03:37.852 --> 01:03:39.274
Ah come on, lighten up a little.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.623
Remember when we met and we
were talking about, like,

01:03:41.623 --> 01:03:43.356
where we come from and then you were-

01:03:43.356 --> 01:03:44.689
Shut up, Bora.

01:03:47.154 --> 01:03:49.987
I swear, I'm out at the next town.

About 45 miles.

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.168
Why, are you hungry?

01:04:17.493 --> 01:04:19.241
Ah, come on, you can't
still be tripping off

01:04:19.241 --> 01:04:21.058
that shit that happened earlier.

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:23.341
That was like three hours ago.

01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.782
Friends fight.

01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:25.996
Let it go.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.569
Come on.
Fight?

01:04:27.569 --> 01:04:29.962
I just watched two people get murdered

01:04:29.962 --> 01:04:31.925
and a third was snorting up enough cocaine

01:04:31.925 --> 01:04:34.402
to fill up the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:35.921
And friends?

01:04:35.921 --> 01:04:38.509
Friends don't go on killing
sprees together, so no,

01:04:38.509 --> 01:04:40.981
I'm not quite over it yet.

01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:44.227
So you really have never
seen a dead buddy before, huh?

01:04:44.227 --> 01:04:46.227
Who do you think I am?

01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:51.237
What, you think Black
people just chill out,

01:04:51.237 --> 01:04:55.570
posted up with dead bodies
on weekends or something?

01:04:56.467 --> 01:04:58.340
Look, you know what you need?

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.742
You need to relax, you need to be present,

01:05:00.742 --> 01:05:03.159
you need to be in the moment.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.060
You ever try meditation?

01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:08.478
Never, huh?

01:05:11.009 --> 01:05:13.420
You know what I think we should do?

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.571
We should play a little game
called Never Have I Ever.

01:05:16.571 --> 01:05:18.897
I mean usually we play with tequila, but,

01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:23.064
this isn't my car so we
can play with our fingers.

01:05:24.203 --> 01:05:26.917
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:05:26.917 --> 01:05:29.425
You never heard of Never Have Ever?

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.738
So basically I say never have I ever

01:05:32.738 --> 01:05:35.023
and then if you've done
whatever the thing is,

01:05:35.023 --> 01:05:38.637
then you put one finger down
and then in the next round,

01:05:38.637 --> 01:05:40.571
the other person says never have I ever

01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:43.505
and the first person to
drop all five fingers loses

01:05:43.505 --> 01:05:45.248
and the other person wins.

01:05:45.248 --> 01:05:46.143
We used to play it in juvie

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:47.973
to get to know each other better.

01:05:47.973 --> 01:05:48.806
Come on.

01:05:54.997 --> 01:05:55.830
Fine.

01:05:57.764 --> 01:05:58.902
I'll play.

01:05:58.902 --> 01:06:01.624
But you can ask all the questions

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.237
'cause this is your dumbass idea.

01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:04.404
Okay, ready?

01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:08.369
Never have I ever killed a woman.

01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:13.705

01:06:13.705 --> 01:06:15.245
Okay, you know what?

01:06:15.245 --> 01:06:19.828
Never have I ever eaten pussy
with the girl's boyfriend

01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:25.600
holding a pistol to my head.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.525
Bora, I swear, if you
put a goddamn finger,

01:06:28.525 --> 01:06:29.358
I'm walking the rest of the way.

01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:32.024
Never have I ever...

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:38.740
Fucked a fine ass stranger
in a black Mercedes C300.

01:06:48.225 --> 01:06:50.612
Hey, we should pull up
on these fools for real.

01:06:50.612 --> 01:06:52.578
- Bora, no.
- They're so cute.

01:06:52.578 --> 01:06:53.728

playing this game anymore.

01:06:53.728 --> 01:06:54.895

How you feeling?

01:09:08.006 --> 01:09:08.913
I'm all right, I'm all right.

01:09:08.913 --> 01:09:09.865
What you need, my guy?

01:09:09.865 --> 01:09:12.100
- Man, you know what I need.
- How can I help you?

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.850
You know what I need.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.872
- You know I got you covered.
- Okay, okay.

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:17.705
As long as you drop that shit off

01:09:17.705 --> 01:09:19.282
that we talked about.

01:09:19.282 --> 01:09:20.857
I'm Bora.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:21.822
Chad.

01:09:21.822 --> 01:09:22.941
You like wine?

01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:25.641
I love wine, especially if it's white.

01:09:26.734 --> 01:09:27.567
Funny.

01:09:28.601 --> 01:09:29.985
Is this your car?

01:09:29.985 --> 01:09:31.377
Yeah. You wanna check it out?

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.321
- I do.
- Let's it go.

01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:34.404
Mmm.

01:09:36.513 --> 01:09:37.346
Is it new?

01:09:38.605 --> 01:09:40.424
- Just got it.
- Buying or leasing?

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.489
Paid cash.

01:09:42.489 --> 01:09:44.989
I don't got no herbs for you right now,

01:09:44.989 --> 01:09:47.231
but I do got that fire ganja juice.

01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:48.453
- Oh.
- What you think about that?

01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:49.286
1000 milligrams.

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:51.453
Goddamn, yo, I've been
looking for shit like this, man.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.009
That's a treat right there.

01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:54.435
Man, you always lookin' out.

01:09:54.435 --> 01:09:55.359
Don't eat it all at once, my guy.

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:56.218
I got you, of course.

01:09:56.218 --> 01:09:57.640
You already know, you already know.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.326
Man I'm gonna go fuck
with this shorty over here.

01:09:59.326 --> 01:10:00.285
- Go ahead.
- All right, fam.

01:10:00.285 --> 01:10:01.337
- Do your thing, my guy.
- We livin', man.

01:10:01.337 --> 01:10:03.837
- Godspeed.
- You guys be safe.

01:10:05.858 --> 01:10:07.190
Well cheers.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:08.023
Salud.

01:10:09.579 --> 01:10:11.971
So you like to salsa?
Are you into dancing?

01:10:11.971 --> 01:10:13.973
- Uh, I can try.
- You can try?

01:10:13.973 --> 01:10:15.159
Mm-hm.

01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:17.629
By the looks of your
car, I think you can salsa.

01:10:19.051 --> 01:10:20.981
So we're gonna take this hand

01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:24.231
and we're actually gonna put it like this

01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:27.907
and then we're gonna go check cha cha cha

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.657
and then cha cha cha.

01:10:31.028 --> 01:10:32.703
There you go.

01:10:32.703 --> 01:10:34.107
Mm-hm.

01:10:34.107 --> 01:10:36.519
Yo, yo, yo. What's up with it, mami?

01:10:36.519 --> 01:10:37.971
How you doin'?

01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:39.775
Don't, don't lean on the car.

01:10:39.775 --> 01:10:41.469
- Oh, okay.
- You're gonna scratch it.

01:10:41.469 --> 01:10:44.302
Okay, okay, okay. My bad, queen.

01:10:46.405 --> 01:10:49.265
What's up with you? You got
a man back home or somethin'?

01:10:49.265 --> 01:10:51.923
Look, you're cute and everything, but-

01:10:51.923 --> 01:10:53.173
Ah, but what?

01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:55.750
Yo, you need to relax.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.954
Yo, see, that's exactly why you met me

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:00.398
'cause I just got some ganja juice gummies

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:01.366
from the homie over there.

01:11:01.366 --> 01:11:03.466
You wanna try some with me?

01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:04.815
I don't really do gummies like that.

01:11:04.815 --> 01:11:06.805
Oh, you don't do gummies?
You don't smoke nothin'?

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:07.872
No.

01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:08.857
Ah, bullshit.

01:11:08.857 --> 01:11:09.857
You hang around with a girl like that,

01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:11.298
there ain't nothing that y'all don't do.

01:11:11.298 --> 01:11:12.881
Don't give me that.

01:11:18.866 --> 01:11:20.310
Don't compare me to her.

01:11:21.763 --> 01:11:23.383
You know what they say.

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:26.091
Two birds of a feather flock together.

01:11:26.091 --> 01:11:28.097
Besides, if it were me,

01:11:28.097 --> 01:11:29.528
I personally wouldn't
wanna be hanging around

01:11:29.528 --> 01:11:34.528
with someone that I didn't
wanna be compared to, so.

01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:35.781
Anyway, I'm BJ.

01:11:37.564 --> 01:11:38.755
I'm E.

01:11:38.755 --> 01:11:40.059
E?

01:11:40.059 --> 01:11:41.355
Like ecstasy?

01:11:41.355 --> 01:11:42.967
Why would that be the first
thing that comes to mind?

01:11:42.967 --> 01:11:43.985
I don't do drugs.

01:11:43.985 --> 01:11:45.568
Okay, okay, okay.

01:11:47.643 --> 01:11:48.643
No pressure.

01:11:49.715 --> 01:11:52.267
What's wrong with you?

01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:54.120
You won't get it.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.203
Try me. I happen to be
a good reader of people.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.535
What do you read about me?

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:03.766
Uh...

01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:06.560
Okay, full disclosure, I
had a late night last night,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.785
so my radar might be a little off,

01:12:08.785 --> 01:12:11.202
but if I had to take a guess,

01:12:14.252 --> 01:12:17.555
I'd say that whatever's chasing you,

01:12:17.555 --> 01:12:18.615
ain't gonna stop chasing you

01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:22.198
until you turn around
and face it, you dig?

01:12:26.136 --> 01:12:27.774
I'm sorry.

01:12:27.774 --> 01:12:28.607
I can't.

01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:32.271
Okay, no worries.

01:12:32.271 --> 01:12:33.968
No pressure.

01:12:35.107 --> 01:12:36.747
Ecstasy.

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:43.075
It's BJ, right?

01:12:43.075 --> 01:12:43.908
Yeah.

01:12:46.156 --> 01:12:48.683
I think you should check on your friend.

01:12:51.682 --> 01:12:56.682
Nah. Look like your homegirl
taking real good care of him.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:59.443
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:12:59.443 --> 01:13:00.495
No I'm not fucking with you.

01:13:00.495 --> 01:13:01.995
Go get your fucking dollars.

01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:03.210
I need you to run.

01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.399
Give me my fucking money.

01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:08.316
Run? Yo, what the fuck
wrong with your girl?

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:12.087
Oh what, let me guess, you
thought I lied to you, huh?

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.671
You are so fucking disrespectful.

01:13:13.671 --> 01:13:15.168
Oh, I'm disrespectful?

01:13:15.168 --> 01:13:16.969
I need you to run.

01:13:16.969 --> 01:13:18.778
Yo, okay, whatever they got is whatever,

01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:20.655
but I ain't the type of
nigga to run from shit,

01:13:20.655 --> 01:13:21.535
you know what I'm saying?

01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:23.129
Like, I know you used
to them other Rudy-poo

01:13:23.129 --> 01:13:24.018
ass niggas in the past,

01:13:24.018 --> 01:13:26.767
but I'm actually trying
to get to know you.

01:13:26.767 --> 01:13:29.684
You got to the count of
three to give me my money.

01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:31.818
I ain't giving you shit.

01:13:31.818 --> 01:13:32.724
Uno...

01:13:32.724 --> 01:13:33.931
I think you more than just cute.

01:13:33.931 --> 01:13:35.118
I need you to run.

01:13:35.118 --> 01:13:36.368
Dos...

01:13:37.498 --> 01:13:38.331
Tres.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.164
What the fuck? Are you serious?

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:40.850
Yo, what the fuck, man?

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.788
- Calm down, come on.
- Hey, hey, girl.

01:13:42.788 --> 01:13:44.934
Yo, chill out. Ain't no need for all that.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:46.306
You got this nice car,

01:13:46.306 --> 01:13:48.510
you got these nice ass shoes on.

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.931
Give me my fucking money.

01:13:50.931 --> 01:13:52.216
Oh my god, let's calm down.

01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:53.049
Oh, let's calm down?

01:13:53.049 --> 01:13:54.142
- Yeah, let's calm down.
- You like that?

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:54.978
- Come on.
- You like it when

01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:55.937
it's in your face like that?

01:13:55.937 --> 01:13:57.944
Aye, aye, fuckin' chill, yo.

01:13:57.944 --> 01:14:00.640
Yo, get the, get the fuckin'
gun out my homeboy's face.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.474
- Give me my fucking money.
- Take it easy.

01:14:03.474 --> 01:14:04.307
Uno...

01:14:05.748 --> 01:14:06.581
Dos...

01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:07.764
Oh, shit.

01:14:07.764 --> 01:14:08.597
- Tres.
- Wait.

01:14:09.959 --> 01:14:11.244
Oh, oh, fu...

01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:12.077
Run!

01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:18.938
Aye, you're leaving the party already?

01:14:20.303 --> 01:14:24.136
I thought it was going
well. What did you do?

01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:26.897
Get in the car.

01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:29.951
Unless you wanna take the
Benz, we can take the Benz.

01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:31.201
Get in the car.

01:14:33.165 --> 01:14:34.591
Get in the car.

Officials
are investigating

01:14:56.838 --> 01:14:58.932
the series of killing
now that several people

01:14:58.932 --> 01:15:01.330
were murdered in LA yesterday.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.903
Now
they're saying the suspect

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:06.484
is a Black woman, which
I refuse to accept.

01:15:06.484 --> 01:15:07.484
Why, Bora?

01:15:09.264 --> 01:15:11.597
They were being nice to us.

01:15:12.594 --> 01:15:14.511
They did nothing wrong.

01:15:18.124 --> 01:15:19.957
Why would you do that?

01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:24.539
They were safe, Bora.

01:15:25.412 --> 01:15:26.458
They were safe.

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:27.291
Look.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.298
I understand your pussy getting
wet off that dread head.

01:15:33.298 --> 01:15:36.332
I really do. He was fine as fuck, okay?

01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:39.582
But that white boy, he disrespected me.

01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:42.429
What?

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:45.954
He disrespected you?

01:15:45.954 --> 01:15:47.308
Mm-hm.

01:15:47.308 --> 01:15:49.819
You were on top of him fucking him

01:15:49.819 --> 01:15:51.483
in the backseat of the
car after knowing him

01:15:51.483 --> 01:15:53.150
for like 20 minutes.

01:15:55.794 --> 01:15:56.627
And...

01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:02.542
You would've killed both them
if, if BJ didn't get away.

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:06.217
First of all, that was
not sex, it was work.

01:16:06.217 --> 01:16:10.641
Secondly, you should know me
well enough by now to know, E,

01:16:10.641 --> 01:16:14.239
that I would never shoot
a Black man in the back.

01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:15.072
What?

01:16:16.562 --> 01:16:20.121
You cut a black man's throat
less than 24 hours ago.

01:16:20.121 --> 01:16:21.387
Yes.

01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:24.510
To protect you, a Black woman.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.415
And do I even get so much as a,

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:29.003
"Oh, Bora, thank you for saving my life,"

01:16:29.003 --> 01:16:31.538
or "O-M-G, Bora, thank
you for making a clean cut

01:16:31.538 --> 01:16:32.882
in that fucker's throat as not

01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:34.326
to get blood on my leggings."

01:16:34.326 --> 01:16:35.159
No.

01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:39.703
But you don't hear me complaining.

01:16:45.482 --> 01:16:48.315
You know what? I'm sorry, E, okay?

01:16:49.758 --> 01:16:52.678
I don't wanna fight with you.

01:16:52.678 --> 01:16:54.678
Besides, it's your turn.

01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:58.123
Come on.

01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:02.148
My turn to do what?

01:17:03.998 --> 01:17:05.665
Never have I ever.

01:17:07.847 --> 01:17:09.014
Fine, I'll go.

01:17:09.982 --> 01:17:13.710
Never have I ever fucked a
white guy in a black Mercedes

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:16.378
who gave me $200 when this fucking pussy

01:17:16.378 --> 01:17:17.954
never goes for less than a G

01:17:17.954 --> 01:17:22.704
and so I had to merc him in
front of his fine ass friend.

01:17:24.522 --> 01:17:26.772
Looks like you win, E. See?

01:17:28.021 --> 01:17:28.854
Karma.

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.292
Good morning, Buttercup.

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.187
Please don't kill me.

01:18:17.332 --> 01:18:18.848
You can take anything you
want, just please don't-

01:18:20.682 --> 01:18:23.265
You scare so easily, sheesh.

01:18:24.222 --> 01:18:25.055
Bora.

01:18:26.926 --> 01:18:28.093
Get off of me.

01:18:28.982 --> 01:18:30.149
Ah, come on.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.674
Where are we?

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.616
I just wanted to make
sure you were alive,

01:18:34.616 --> 01:18:36.054
like gave you some water.

01:18:36.054 --> 01:18:38.238
All we had left was tequila.

01:18:38.238 --> 01:18:39.886
You didn't respond to that.

01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:40.788
You hit your head pretty hard

01:18:40.788 --> 01:18:41.903
when you grabbed the steering wheel

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:43.417
and we hit that bump.

01:18:43.417 --> 01:18:45.186
How you feeling?

01:18:45.186 --> 01:18:47.321
Where are we and why do you keep wearing

01:18:47.321 --> 01:18:49.521
that goddamn mask?

01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:52.754
Because it's Day of the
Dead, Dia de Los Muertos.

01:18:52.754 --> 01:18:55.193
When all the spirits come out to play,

01:18:55.193 --> 01:18:58.167
so I figured I should
come out and play, too.

01:18:58.167 --> 01:18:59.000
Hey, speaking of which,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.382
you're gonna need some sort of disguise.

01:19:01.382 --> 01:19:04.427
Yeah, because they'll
never notice two POCs

01:19:04.427 --> 01:19:07.877
wearing the faces of dead
in the ever so white desert.

01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:10.917
Oh look, I got one for you, okay?

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.707
You know what?

01:19:14.907 --> 01:19:18.816
This is the one that I use to
get out of speeding tickets.

01:19:18.816 --> 01:19:21.978
If it work for me, it can work for you.

01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:25.395
Especially since you don't have a record.

01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:29.624
Well, at least not yet you don't,

01:19:29.624 --> 01:19:31.362
but you get the point.

01:19:31.362 --> 01:19:33.184
Where are we?

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.512
Where are you going?

01:19:39.116 --> 01:19:39.949
Bora.

01:19:42.306 --> 01:19:43.139
My car.

01:19:44.643 --> 01:19:46.178
Somebody will drive by, eventually.

01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:51.459
Hey, this view is amazing,
though. You can see for miles.

01:19:53.924 --> 01:19:55.757
I already tried that.

01:19:58.459 --> 01:20:00.474
You can be a little help right now.

01:20:00.474 --> 01:20:02.415
You know what you should do?

01:20:02.415 --> 01:20:05.638
Just take a moment and, like,
look around you at the sights.

01:20:05.638 --> 01:20:07.353
Like look at this. You can see for miles.

01:20:07.353 --> 01:20:08.436
It's amazing.

01:20:11.177 --> 01:20:14.362
Can you help me figure this shit out?

01:20:14.362 --> 01:20:18.362
Um, I don't really know
much about cars, love.

01:20:19.274 --> 01:20:20.917
Hey, but I got a homeboy who's a mechanic.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:21.922
You want me to call him?

01:20:21.922 --> 01:20:25.458
No, I don't wanna meet
anyone else on this trip.

01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:27.762
Oh no, you met him already, remember?

01:20:27.762 --> 01:20:29.345
His name was Chino.

01:20:30.334 --> 01:20:32.667
Oh, fuck. Did we kill Chino?

01:20:33.834 --> 01:20:35.173
Damn.

01:20:35.173 --> 01:20:37.489
We did, didn't we?

01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:38.805
Yeah, I guess now wouldn't be a good time

01:20:38.805 --> 01:20:40.979
to ask him for a favor.

01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:42.182
Hey, you got AAA?

01:20:42.182 --> 01:20:45.222
This is not the fucking time, Bora.

01:20:45.222 --> 01:20:47.206
If now is not a good
time to call a mechanic,

01:20:47.206 --> 01:20:48.956
I don't know when is.

01:20:53.606 --> 01:20:55.790
Is that my phone?

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:57.638
Yeah, it is.
You want me to answer it?

01:20:57.638 --> 01:21:00.536
No, give me my phone, Bora.

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:02.044
What are you gonna do if I don't?

01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:04.127
Give me my phone, Bora.

01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:13.490
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:14.541
Can I tell you something?

01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.463
No. Let me tell you something.

01:21:17.463 --> 01:21:19.314
I left LA as a normal person

01:21:19.314 --> 01:21:22.038
with a college degree and big dreams.

01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:25.604
I had a good man with a
good heart and great friends

01:21:25.604 --> 01:21:29.682
and no fucking problem
until you showed up.

01:21:29.682 --> 01:21:32.408
Just because you come
from a shitty upbringing

01:21:32.408 --> 01:21:35.038
with shitty parents
and no fucking friends,

01:21:35.038 --> 01:21:39.038
you think you can come
into my life and ruin it?

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:42.791
Yeah, that might be a little naive

01:21:43.658 --> 01:21:46.122
and you might be about that life,

01:21:46.122 --> 01:21:48.455
but my life is worth living.

01:21:51.587 --> 01:21:55.354
And I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

01:21:55.354 --> 01:21:56.854
Do you understand?

01:21:57.882 --> 01:21:59.965
I will never be like you.

01:22:04.714 --> 01:22:05.964
Are you done?

01:22:08.302 --> 01:22:11.442
You know you're really
sexy when you angry.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:14.058
You know that?

01:22:14.058 --> 01:22:16.970
I'm glad you find all of this amusing.

01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.489
All you do is smoke pounds of weed,

01:22:19.489 --> 01:22:21.866
screw and, and kill people.

01:22:21.866 --> 01:22:24.366
And now you've run my car off
the road and almost kill us.

01:22:24.366 --> 01:22:27.006
You're so fucking dramatic.

01:22:27.006 --> 01:22:28.738
First of all, I told you,

01:22:28.738 --> 01:22:32.542
never have I ever killed a woman, okay?

01:22:32.542 --> 01:22:35.677
Never. So why would I
start with a Black woman?

01:22:35.677 --> 01:22:39.094
What do I look like to you? Fuckin' LAPD?

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:46.483
Hey, speaking of LAPD, how did
it feel when that cop died?

01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:52.653
Because I thought it felt pretty good.

01:22:53.722 --> 01:22:54.555
What?

01:22:57.705 --> 01:22:58.538
No.

01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:01.754
No.

01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.700
No, you told me he let us go.
Of course he let us go.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:07.700
He was dead.

01:23:14.895 --> 01:23:16.635
You killed a fucking cop?

01:23:16.635 --> 01:23:17.990
I had to kill him.

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:20.114
If I didn't kill him,
he was gonna kill you

01:23:20.114 --> 01:23:21.824
or some other fucking Black person

01:23:21.824 --> 01:23:24.731
in another day or another week.

01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:26.032
What did you want me to do?

01:23:26.032 --> 01:23:26.865
No.

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:32.555
Give me my fucking phone.

01:23:33.985 --> 01:23:36.182
I wouldn't
read that if I were you.

01:23:36.182 --> 01:23:38.349
Well, you're not me, so.

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:52.375
"USC grad student kills boyfriend
and goes on murder spree?"

01:23:54.108 --> 01:23:59.108
Why would she send me this?

01:24:04.076 --> 01:24:04.909
No.

01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:07.761
Why do you think?

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.127
No, Bora.

01:24:36.118 --> 01:24:40.535
If I gotta die, that means
everybody gotta die, too.

01:24:45.742 --> 01:24:47.909
You're not real, are you?

01:24:50.431 --> 01:24:53.282
I'm as real as you allow me to be.

01:24:53.282 --> 01:24:54.865
Don't overthink it.

01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:59.190
Thoughts become things, remember?

01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:01.940
I'm the best friend you ever had.

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:22.917
Come on.

01:25:23.938 --> 01:25:26.907
Hey, remember when we
were at Chino's house

01:25:26.907 --> 01:25:28.710
and you lured Christos into the kitchen

01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:31.862
so you could see a dead body?

01:25:44.099 --> 01:25:46.917
Hey, when I saw you hike your
skirt all up on your booty

01:25:46.917 --> 01:25:50.352
so you could accidentally
get his attention,

01:25:50.352 --> 01:25:51.495
bitch, I was low key proud.

01:25:51.495 --> 01:25:54.412
I thought, "Damn, that's my bitch."

01:25:55.897 --> 01:25:57.275
And you know what my favorite part

01:25:57.275 --> 01:26:00.245
of this whole experience was?

01:26:00.245 --> 01:26:01.785
When you distracted that dread head

01:26:01.785 --> 01:26:05.025
so his friend could trick off on me.

01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:07.608
That money paid for our dinner.

01:26:08.641 --> 01:26:09.733
You even told him to run

01:26:09.733 --> 01:26:13.897
so he didn't have to watch his
homie die when we shot him.

01:26:13.897 --> 01:26:18.814
Hey, if that's not a good
friend, I don't know what is, ma.

01:26:26.045 --> 01:26:28.628
Ah, you're so dramatic, Elon.

01:26:29.761 --> 01:26:31.344
Remember that LAPD?

01:26:32.529 --> 01:26:33.362
Mm.

01:26:35.585 --> 01:26:38.335
I'm as real as you want me to be.

01:27:07.525 --> 01:27:09.013
Bora!

01:27:09.013 --> 01:27:10.049
Bora!

J, you and I both know,

01:27:47.902 --> 01:27:50.285
that Black women don't do stuff like this.

01:27:50.285 --> 01:27:52.277
What do you think the motive was?

01:27:52.277 --> 01:27:53.461
I don't know,

01:27:53.461 --> 01:27:55.042
but they have multiple witnesses

01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:58.194
who gave descriptions of
this chick with an afro.

01:27:58.194 --> 01:28:02.241
The crazy thing is she was
wearing a Day of the Dead mask,

01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:05.502
so nobody knows exactly
what she looks like.

01:28:05.502 --> 01:28:07.248
Nobody
can confirm her identity,

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:10.294
so I don't believe it
and I won't believe it

01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:14.170
until we have 100%
confirmation that she is Black.

01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:17.275
It just don't make sense
to me, but it is Halloween,

01:28:17.275 --> 01:28:19.275
