NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.294 --> 00:04.838
-Joe, I gotta cuff!
-(Lynn groaning)

00:04.921 --> 00:06.673
We'd have your turkey face for breakfast!

00:07.048 --> 00:09.926
-I'm right here. Come on.
-Hey, Harley, turn it off.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.220
You've got several hundred dollars' worth
of parking tickets in there.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.305
You can have the entire lot for $29.95.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.433
-I'm pregnant, Frank.
-Paul Grogin.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.310
-PHIL: The Belles of St. Mary's!
-Sergeant Esterhaus.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.273
-That wasn't so bad.
-Yeah.

00:23.356 --> 00:26.526
-OFFICER: Mr. Tatum.
-Yes, Coffey could have killed him,

00:27.152 --> 00:29.779
but it could have been the guy
in the next cell, Frank.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.992
You bully me into turning down this job,
and then I resent you for it forever.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.368
Who killed my brother?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.871
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:37.954 --> 00:39.497
Whose side are you guys on, anyway?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.458
Relax, Joe.
We're just asking some questions.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.210
-The officer goes into the cell...
-And then he chokes him.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.462
I have a special cream.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.464
It's made from the secretions
of queen bees.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.840
Secretions, huh?

00:48.923 --> 00:52.260
I want to make a life with you.
I want us to be married.

00:54.637 --> 00:58.349
Item nine, people, this is important.
As of this morning,

00:58.433 --> 01:04.689
I.A.D. begins the official investigation
of the in-custody death of Lynn Tatum.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.735
If you have any knowledge reflecting
on the circumstance of this case,

01:08.818 --> 01:11.029
please avail yourself
to the proper authorities.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.280
If not, stay clear.

01:12.363 --> 01:16.743
As far as the press on this matter,
the suggestion is to approach them only

01:16.826 --> 01:19.287
only within the confines
of a 50-foot pole.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.581
-I.E., keep a tight lip.
-OFFICER 1: Yeah.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.292
Now, while we have nothing to hide,

01:24.751 --> 01:27.378
the chances of misunderstanding
and misinterpretation

01:27.462 --> 01:30.256
in this potentially eruptive situation
are considerable,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.300
so let's not add to the tension, shall we?

01:32.717 --> 01:36.471
The importance of maintaining
a calm and perceptive profile

01:36.846 --> 01:40.517
is reiterated in a memo
from Captain Furillo.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.310
It reads, "The death of Lynn Tatum

01:42.393 --> 01:45.271
can be expected to produce
an unknown amount of backlash

01:45.355 --> 01:46.314
from the community.

01:46.397 --> 01:50.110
I am certain that all officers under
my command who encounter such backlash

01:50.318 --> 01:53.154
will respond to it
with intelligence and forbearance.

01:53.238 --> 01:57.158
Above all, we must try to understand
the natural suspicion

01:57.242 --> 01:59.619
surrounding the incident
and do our level best

01:59.702 --> 02:02.997
to maintain our professional relationship
with the public."

02:04.582 --> 02:05.750
Now, as an addendum,

02:05.834 --> 02:09.921
keep clear of the downstairs cells
until further notice.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.049
There's a murder investigation
underway there.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.927
Be aware there's an outstanding warrant
for Sonny Crockett,

02:16.010 --> 02:19.931
wanted for questioning in relation
to the Tatum death.

02:20.014 --> 02:24.978
Item last, today, Detective Belker
goes undercover at 137th and Hurdle

02:25.061 --> 02:28.231
in an effort to apprehend
certain cultural parasites

02:28.606 --> 02:33.736
doing a fast and lucrative business
in bootleg designer jeans.

02:33.820 --> 02:38.158
He will assume the guise
of the classical poet Homer...

02:38.241 --> 02:39.826
-Homer who?
-...that of a blind man.

02:39.909 --> 02:44.706
Backups are as follows:
Gomez, Prebatone, Berellis, Meljonich.

02:44.789 --> 02:47.876
Detective Belker will instruct you
in your duties at the site.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.297
-All right, that's it! Let's roll!
-(all clamoring)

02:52.380 --> 02:54.048
And, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:54.841 --> 02:56.593
Let's be careful out there, huh?

02:56.968 --> 03:01.472
(all chattering)

03:06.686 --> 03:08.271
This place is pretty cool, huh?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.857
Uh, hi, Kristen,
can I see you for a minute?

03:11.399 --> 03:12.233
Hold that.

03:13.943 --> 03:18.573
Don't look right. Don't look left.
Keep on walking straight on.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.995
-That's ten country morning snack--
-Country snakes.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.999
-Ten country morning snacks.
-Yeah.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.711
-Five lumberjack specials.
-All right.

03:31.794 --> 03:35.256
-And six galloping grapefruits.
-Galloping fruits.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.175
-You got all that?
-Yeah.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.263
Okay, now, here is the money. Money.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.724
You know--
you're sure you know where the place is?

03:44.807 --> 03:48.269
Yeah, it's-it's on the corner of walk
and don't walk,

03:48.519 --> 03:49.979
across the street from the intersection

03:50.063 --> 03:52.982
where the signal light
goes out every time it rains.

03:54.567 --> 03:59.530
Leo, did I just see you
assign that prelimbic,

03:59.614 --> 04:04.118
single-helixed mutoid
to today's breakfast run?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.829
Yeah. He's trying to get straight.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.249
I figured a little responsibility
might help.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.211
Judas H. on horseback,
don't you know once he is on the street,

04:13.378 --> 04:17.757
that money goes directly into rearranging
the molecular chemistry of his cerebellum?

04:17.840 --> 04:19.884
Oh, I-I think you're wrong, Lieutenant.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.470
He's very determined.

04:23.429 --> 04:27.684
-Uh, I-I'm not hurting you, am I, Kristen?
-No, it feels nice.

04:28.101 --> 04:33.189
Yeah, uh, and now, see,
we-we roll the fingers across the paper.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.942
I don't like pipes.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.152
-You don't?
-They're so trendy.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.198
That wasn't so bad, now was it? Here.

04:43.992 --> 04:48.579
Kristen, you...
your hands are so... so soft.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.000
Well, I have a special cream I like
to rub in all over my skin.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.084
You do, huh?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.586
Yeah, it's made from the secretions
of queen bees.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.088
Secretions, huh?

04:57.630 --> 05:01.134
Uh, what part of your body--
skin do you rub this cream on?

05:02.218 --> 05:05.430
Well, I like to rub it in
on the undersides of my legs...

05:05.513 --> 05:07.473
-J.D.: Uh-huh.
-...and then sometimes,

05:07.682 --> 05:09.892
I like to rub it in
all over my shoulders...

05:09.976 --> 05:11.269
-J.D.: Uh-huh.
-...and sometimes,

05:11.352 --> 05:14.230
I like to get it in my hands
and rub it in between them

05:14.314 --> 05:17.066
-so it squishes out between my fingers...
-Ah.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.777
-...and sometimes, I like to rub it--
-GIRL: Kristen, come on!

05:21.779 --> 05:22.697
I have to go.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.283
Thanks for showing me
how you fingerprint criminals.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.326
Oh, hey.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.369
KRISTEN: I just learned how to...

05:29.495 --> 05:33.374
Alabaster skin, man,
supple bosoms uptilted.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.752
Mandatory 5-year sentence,
loss of pension,

05:35.835 --> 05:37.920
picture in the paper, mm-hmm.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.883
Goodbye, John.
I hope you don't have too hard of a day.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.762
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:47.597
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:47.680 --> 05:51.476
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:51.559 --> 05:53.102
(sirens wailing)

05:58.775 --> 06:02.487
(theme music playing)

07:00.461 --> 07:03.005
RENKO: Did you ever notice
how the little pigeons only perch

07:03.089 --> 07:05.383
-on amber lights?
-BOBBY: Hm?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.218
The traffic signals?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.555
Whereas your red and green
are on the average of 30 seconds,

07:10.638 --> 07:11.639
and so every minute,

07:12.181 --> 07:14.934
the amber only lights up only
a few seconds in between.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.770
The pigeons don't have to worry about it

07:17.854 --> 07:20.440
glaring in their tiny,
little eyes so much.

07:21.524 --> 07:25.945
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Unit 2202, unit 477,</i>
<i>request backup for domestic situation</i>

07:26.028 --> 07:29.240
<i>at 1906 Freeman Drive. Can you respond?</i>

07:29.323 --> 07:31.742
Twenty-two zero two, we'll take it.
Turn up the alley there.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.163
(tires squealing)

07:36.998 --> 07:41.085
(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)

07:41.169 --> 07:43.004
RENKO: Well, well, looks like we're gonna
break up a little tea party here.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.046
BOBBY: Back it up, Renko.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.925
(tires squealing, screeching)

07:51.721 --> 07:53.181
(gate clanking)

07:54.098 --> 07:58.227
Freeze! All right, up against the wall.
Come on. Let's go.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.898
He's rich!

08:02.815 --> 08:03.941
What you got here, boy?

08:05.485 --> 08:09.530
(spits) Smack! Come on. Let's go.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.002
Excuse me, buddy. Could I have your name,

08:23.085 --> 08:24.795
-telephone number...
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.507
(overlapping dialog)

08:27.590 --> 08:28.633
(both laughing)

08:28.716 --> 08:30.009
J.D.: Hey, what do you know, huh?

08:30.301 --> 08:31.761
Johnny, where were you last night
when I needed you, huh?

08:31.844 --> 08:32.678
What happened?

08:32.762 --> 08:34.305
I was robbed in my front yard,
shot at in my living room,

08:34.388 --> 08:36.474
and mugged in my kitchen.
I gotta divorce that woman.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.518
(both laugh)

08:38.601 --> 08:40.353
And, you know,
I'm gonna make this guy my manager.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.480
He's already got me booked
for five to ten at San Quentin.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.024
-Oh.
-(J.D. and Vic laughing)

08:45.107 --> 08:46.275
Look at this.
You know what this is right here?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.653
This is 500 big ones
in developmental capital.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.530
Man, people have been coming up
to me all day

08:50.613 --> 08:54.033
trying to get a piece of the action.
Some of us can recognize talent.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.494
(stutters) Johnny, you're sensational.
I mean, you're a genius, huh?

08:56.577 --> 08:59.413
Take this, right? You go on down
to Paviola's over on Crawford Drive.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.832
You get a haircut, a manicure, a shave,
you get the works.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.586
Then you go to Armando's over on Edgemont.
You get a suit. Ask for Linda.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.256
Don't let them give you anybody else,
right? Linda. All right. Linda.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.800
All right, then you go to Rob's Auto
Leasing, you pick up a set of wheels.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.970
Hey, you're gonna be a winner, sweetheart,
you gotta look like one.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.222
Johnny, I, uh...

09:18.182 --> 09:20.977
And I don't know what to say. Uh...

09:22.395 --> 09:24.105
I'll dance at your wedding. (chuckles)

09:24.939 --> 09:30.278
Um... you know any sick kids?
I'll do the benefit. (chuckles)

09:31.904 --> 09:34.907
I, um, I mean, I-I owe everything to you.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.410
And-and you know,
there isn't gonna be a day in my life

09:37.493 --> 09:38.911
that I'm gonna, you know,
forgive and forget--

09:38.995 --> 09:41.205
All right, hey,
would you just can it, huh, Vic?

09:42.790 --> 09:43.874
-You're right.
-(chuckles)

09:45.585 --> 09:48.337
Hey, listen, you know how to tell
if Godzilla's in the bathtub with you?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.797
You can smell Cleveland on his breath.

09:49.880 --> 09:54.594
(both laughing)

09:55.094 --> 09:56.637
Ma, please!

09:58.347 --> 10:00.141
Of course I'm happy he's better.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.768
I was just thinking that
it might be better for him

10:02.852 --> 10:05.730
to spend a couple more days
in the care unit, that's all.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.274
Uh, could you hold on for a second, Mom?

10:08.566 --> 10:09.483
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.195
-Uh, where you going?
-To check out a unit. Where else?

10:13.613 --> 10:18.159
Um... who's your partner today?
You have a beat yet?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.077
Yeah, my partner's Bat Masterson,

10:20.161 --> 10:22.371
and we're goin' after them rustlers
on the north range.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.957
-Come on.
-You're doing it again, Mick.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.543
You're being a Jewish mother.
I'm gonna ignore it.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.259
Hi, Ma.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.527
Everything okay, Joe?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.780
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.074
Captain says I.A.D.'s gonna talk to me
in an hour.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.078
You go ahead and get reassigned, Luce.
It's okay.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.414
No, I-I mean, it's okay.
I got plenty of paperwork I can get done.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.374
Really. No sweat.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.087
-They gonna talk to you?
-Three o'clock. Don't worry.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.089
I'm not gonna say anything
that might hurt you.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.008
There ain't nothing to say
but what happened.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.221
Okay! I'm just trying to do what's right.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.225
No progress in locating
Sonny Crockett, the biker.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.103
We got a report that he cleaned out
his hotel room

11:27.186 --> 11:29.188
about an hour after being
released yesterday.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.898
And hasn't been back. That's it.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.068
Let's find out who his friends are,
what places his group hangs out.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.570
Wouldn't hurt to put a description
in all the local bars too.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.905
I say he's gone cross-country, Frank.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.449
A man on a motorcycle's about
as mobile as you can get.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.993
We got an A.P.B. out
with the state police.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.664
Mobile, yes, but also highly visible.
I think he's still in town.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.332
Who's keeping an eye on Joe Coffey?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.335
Officer Coffey's on duty
at the front desk.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.255
I don't see that any useful purpose
would be served by watching him.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.674
I'm not here to burn Officer Coffey
at the stake.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.759
I'm here to find out
who murdered Lynn Tatum.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.512
I have to say the attitude of this
precinct has been less than

12:01.595 --> 12:05.224
-satisfactory moving it along.
-In what way less than satisfactory?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.145
I need your interrogation room
for interviews.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.355
I was told I could have it
if and when it was available.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.774
Well you have it for the whole day,
what else?

12:14.191 --> 12:16.110
I asked for Coffey's work file
an hour ago.

12:16.318 --> 12:20.322
Ray, see to it that Lieutenant Shipman
has ready access to everything he needs.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.075
No dragging.
We're cooperating in this 100 percent.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.163
-Yes, Frank.
-Anything else, Lieutenant?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.374
No, not unless you know
how to remove the knife in my back

12:30.458 --> 12:34.086
your people keep putting there
with their eyes. Thank you, Captain.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.807
Oh, it is a bit past the breakfast hour,
isn't it, old chum?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.851
He might have got lost. It happens.

12:48.934 --> 12:53.105
Hmm. Well, I decided not to wait, myself.
I had a croissant with my cocoa.

13:02.907 --> 13:07.787
-Heroin, Leo. Two buyers and a seller.
-LEO: Names first. You first.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.705
-Tell him your name.
-LEO: Name!

13:10.581 --> 13:11.582
-Kinney.
-What?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.209
KINNEY:<i> Kinney.</i>

13:15.586 --> 13:18.506
-You got a first name goes with that?
-Dennis.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.760
Dennis Kinney Jr.? Senator Kinney's son?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.180
How can I help you people?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.058
LYNN'S MOM: I came to see the cell!

13:29.433 --> 13:32.478
I want you to show me the cell
where my son died!

13:32.561 --> 13:35.022
I'm Reverend Banks
from the Holy Christ church.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.483
I want Mrs. Tatum and her daughter here
to see this place.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.361
'Cause they can no longer live in peace
with themselves until they do.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.823
-Mrs. Tatum, you don't--
-Show me! I have a right!

13:43.906 --> 13:46.742
I have a right to see!

13:47.243 --> 13:49.036
Ma'am, I'm afraid that's not possible.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.788
-How many of you did it take?
-(sobs)

13:51.413 --> 13:54.124
How many of you pigs did it take
to kill my brother?

13:54.291 --> 13:57.086
-Don't--
-Captain, this is Mrs. Tatum,

13:57.378 --> 13:59.338
her daughter, and the Reverend Banks.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.757
-Reverend, Mrs. Tatum.
-(sniffles)

14:02.842 --> 14:07.471
So you're in charge.
You're the man who let my son die!

14:07.555 --> 14:10.182
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tatum.
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.476
-Sorry?
-He's sorry!

14:12.852 --> 14:14.270
He's sorry. He wants us to believe that!

14:14.353 --> 14:16.730
Mrs. Tatum made a request to see the place
where her son died.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.400
I don't see that that would serve
any purpose, Reverend.

14:19.483 --> 14:24.613
You don't want us to have nothing!
Nothing!

14:25.322 --> 14:27.616
Whoa. That is not a good idea.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.744
...And leave him there all alone!

14:31.078 --> 14:34.498
Why would you just throw him in there
and let him die?

14:34.790 --> 14:38.127
Ma'am, I-I don't know if you're familiar
with the effect of the drug

14:38.210 --> 14:42.381
-such as the one your son had taken.
-Oh, no. No! Uh-uh! He was a good boy!

14:42.756 --> 14:46.260
He made some mistakes,
but he was gonna get over it!

14:46.343 --> 14:47.678
Who killed my brother?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.306
-Which of you killed my brother?
-Ma'am.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.851
It has not been established
that any police officer killed anyone.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.352
Reverend, could you help out here, please?

14:55.436 --> 14:58.856
Yes, Captain, I will,
but I'm only here as a witness,

14:59.189 --> 15:01.942
and people are watching you,
and we are here as a presence.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.944
We're doing everything possible.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.696
A boy died in this place!

15:05.779 --> 15:07.781
How can I make you feel
that death, Captain?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.534
How can I make you feel it
deep in your heart?

15:10.618 --> 15:17.374
Oh, my poor Lynn. My poor baby! (sobs)

15:17.458 --> 15:20.377
-(yells) Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!
-Oh, please stop.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.714
LYNN'S SISTER (sobbing): Mama! Mama!

15:24.214 --> 15:25.966
Oh, good God.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.510
-Please, grab her. Please.
-RENKO: You're gonna have to go, ma'am.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.306
-(yells) Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!
-Mama!

15:32.640 --> 15:36.226
Murderers! Murderers! No!

15:41.649 --> 15:42.733
Thank you.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.282
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.992
What's your name, Sonny?

15:52.701 --> 15:55.120
Oh, my name's Archie. What's your name?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.414
Tell me, Archie,
what do you know about sheep?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.624
-Sheep?
-Sheep?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.167
I don't get you.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.836
You know it takes 50 acres
of prime grazing land

16:02.920 --> 16:04.463
-to feed one sheep?
-Oh, yeah?

16:04.546 --> 16:07.549
-You know it takes five square blocks
of this city to feed one blind man?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.802
You're on my turf, Sonny, so scram.
Beat it.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.722
Wait a minute, if you're a blind man,

16:13.806 --> 16:16.392
how'd you know there was another
blind man standing here?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.727
-I heard you tapping your cane.
-I ain't got no cane.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.773
-Oh, yeah, smart guy? What's that right?
-(laughs)

16:22.940 --> 16:25.275
Scram, Sonny, before I call a cop.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.200
Mr. Kinney and Mr. St. Clair
met you in a parking lot

16:33.283 --> 16:35.995
on 15th street at 7:30 this morning.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.539
From there, you took them into an alleyway

16:38.622 --> 16:42.751
and sold them 20 nickel bags of heroin
for $200. Correct so far?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.963
I upped the ticket on 'em.
I saw those two coming through the door.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.009
When the police appeared,
Mr. Kinney pocketed the heroin.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.387
Then the three of you attempted to escape
on foot but were apprehended.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.514
That's it. That's exactly what happened.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.059
I have to say, Mr. Dundee,
I seldom see a client as confident

16:59.143 --> 17:01.228
about his situation as you seem to be.

17:01.603 --> 17:05.357
Well, ma'am, there's justice in the world
and then there's<i> justice.</i>

17:05.733 --> 17:07.735
This time out,
I got me some of the justice.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.821
You were seen taking the money,
you were seen handing over the heroin.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.157
(clicks tongue)
It's a matter of proximity, ma'am,

17:13.323 --> 17:16.577
and those two boys was just
as "proximate" as I was.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.913
They ain't gonna go put some
poor Black dealer in jail

17:20.080 --> 17:23.125
if it means putting
the senator's son there, too. I'm gone.

17:23.917 --> 17:24.835
(knocking on door)

17:32.426 --> 17:34.011
-Hi, Joyce.
-Hi, Doug.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.847
-Don't mean to barge in.
-DUNDEE: Who's the suit?

17:37.473 --> 17:41.393
Douglas Comstock, attorney.
Macio Dundee, alleged felon.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.270
DOUG:
I'm here to help out with Dennis Kinney.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.481
-All right!
-What is it, Doug?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.858
In case you're considering some kind
of separate deal for your client,

17:47.941 --> 17:50.360
I think I should tell you that
it's in your best interest to see

17:50.444 --> 17:53.363
-what six hours will bring.
-Can you be more explicit?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.240
I'm working on a dismissal
on other grounds.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.951
Your Mr. Dundee will be included,
of course.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.829
I like that suit.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.292
Uh... What, uh, were they doing?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.920
Picking up a little diversion
for spring break?

18:08.003 --> 18:08.837
No comment.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.305
(sighs) Clark. Joyce.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.225
I'm sorry,
I'm not going to be able to make it.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.768
I'm jammed through lunch.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.687
I want to see you, too. Um.

18:25.938 --> 18:31.235
How about drinks later
at the Four Oaks, about 6:30? Great.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.571
Mmm, me too. Bye.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.117
Counselor. Business?

18:38.700 --> 18:42.538
Hi, Frank. Uh, the Dennis Kinney
situation, I pulled the dealer,

18:43.747 --> 18:46.834
who, uh, by the way,
is anticipating an early release

18:46.917 --> 18:50.003
-on a little upper-class justice.
-We're doing Kinney by the numbers.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.297
You mean he'll be out
by 3:30 instead of 3:00.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.508
Talk to you later. I've gotta run.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.637
SHIPMAN: Why did you bring clothes
to Tatum in the holding cell?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.139
I felt sorry for him.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.558
You felt sorry for somebody
who assaulted you twice?

19:02.766 --> 19:03.684
He was sick.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.435
What did he say
when you brought him the clothes?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.479
-JOE: He didn't say anything.
-What did you say to him?

19:08.063 --> 19:08.981
I don't remember.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.109
Uh, something like, "Put these on,"
or something.

19:12.734 --> 19:13.944
What have you got against Blacks, Joe?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.530
What kind of question is that?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.242
I don't have anything against Blacks.
I work with them every day.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.326
You ever used the word "nigger"?

19:22.619 --> 19:25.914
Everybody has once in a while.
<i>They </i>use it.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.499
And now,
what does that have to do with this?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.294
How do you think you conducted yourself
at the Tatum arrest?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.920
Like a police officer.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.256
How did it feel when you choked him out?

19:34.923 --> 19:37.926
Hey, what's going on here?
Who's side are you guys on anyway?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.887
Relax, Joe,
we're just asking some questions.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.472
No, where do I stand with you guys?
You tell me that!

19:42.556 --> 19:45.225
This isn't a grand jury.
We don't decide anything here, Joe.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.852
We just want to hear
your side of the story.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.147
All right, all right.
I... I didn't feel anything.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.316
I didn't hate the guy.
I didn't love the guy.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.483
I just wanted to get him down.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.235
I would have done anything
to get the guy down.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.653
All right. Excuse us, gentlemen.

19:56.737 --> 20:01.700
I would like to have a word with my client
while he's in such an expansive mood. Now.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.417
-Are you my lawyer?
-Yeah.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.335
Well, where the hell were you? I'm--

20:11.418 --> 20:12.920
I'm sorry,
I should have gotten here sooner,

20:13.003 --> 20:15.881
but nobody told me I was gonna be
defending Francis the Talking Mule.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.467
Is there someplace we could go?
Come on. Come on.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.099
Can't we do this out there?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.768
SAM:
Why, is there some incriminating evidence

20:27.851 --> 20:29.519
you didn't give I.A.D. the first time?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.438
I'm supposed to talk to them, right?
What am I gonna do?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.065
You're gonna stop being a motormouth,

20:33.148 --> 20:35.275
which might be difficult in your case,
but give it a shot.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.403
I didn't do anything!
I got nothing to feel guilty about!

20:38.487 --> 20:41.531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, let me tell you something, Joe.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.242
I take a lot of these cases,

20:43.617 --> 20:46.286
and even the ones where it's obvious
that nobody did anything to anybody,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.789
they still end up
in civil lawsuits or worse.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.583
Now look,
I am not asking you to do a single thing

20:51.667 --> 20:54.211
that doesn't go along with
what you know to be the truth.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.046
All I'm asking you is to play it smart.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.383
-Well, what do you want me to do?
-SAM: I told you, I want you to start

20:59.466 --> 21:01.134
by keeping your mouth closed
unless I'm there.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.845
You got one friend in life right now.
That's me.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.181
By the way, the name's Sam Weiser.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.184
Let me ask you something, Sam.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.019
Do you always conduct your interviews
in the john?

21:12.229 --> 21:13.355
Well, in your case, yeah.

21:13.689 --> 21:17.317
I wanted to give you a preview
of what you're into... up to your neck.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.614
It shouldn't have to happen
to a guy like Joe Coffey.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.034
It just ain't right. It seems like every
time the least little thing happens

21:26.118 --> 21:28.954
to a minority member in this town,
some cop's gotta pay for it.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.999
It isn't just that it happened
to a Black man, Andy.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.626
-There's the circumstances.
-You don't think Joe Coffey did it.

21:35.002 --> 21:35.919
No, of course not!

21:36.003 --> 21:38.046
Then circumstances
ain't got nothing to do with it.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.507
Somebody killed a prisoner
in a police holding cell!

21:40.590 --> 21:42.759
You can't expect people
to just stand by and accept that!

21:42.843 --> 21:43.677
All right, just--

21:43.760 --> 21:46.430
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Unit 2202,</i>
<i>pick up on a want for questioning</i>

21:46.513 --> 21:51.351
<i>at Junior's Pool Hall, 133 North Utica,</i>
<i>a Crockett, Sonny, male Caucasian,</i>

21:51.435 --> 21:54.730
<i>-age 29...</i>
-Oh, just great. A biker in a pool hall.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.773
If there's anything worse
than busting a biker,

21:56.857 --> 21:59.818
-it's busting one in a pool hall.
-Now you just wait a minute, pal.

21:59.901 --> 22:03.155
As one who is familiar and happy
with the open road,

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
I'm here to tell you that all these boys

22:05.073 --> 22:07.659
are not necessarily
all looking for trouble!

22:07.743 --> 22:09.703
Anything you say, Renko.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.955
RENKO: They've had these motorcycle
pictures out of Hollywood!

22:12.039 --> 22:14.875
They've had that Peter Fonda
and that-that communism...

22:14.958 --> 22:17.085
BOBBY: You know, you're just crazy.
You know that?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.671
RENKO: ...Firing guns out the back
of a pickup truck

22:19.755 --> 22:20.672
at two people on a bike!

22:20.756 --> 22:23.925
Now, I have belonged to motorcycle clubs
my personal self.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.219
They are constructive
social organizations.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.056
-Uh-huh.
-There is no need for this!

22:29.264 --> 22:30.640
You are buying trouble.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.185
You are announcing your need for trouble
by wearing that!

22:33.268 --> 22:36.855
What are you talking about?
I grew up in a pool hall! Now let's go.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.940
And let me tell you something,

22:39.024 --> 22:41.693
you never forget the sound
of the business end of a cue stick

22:41.777 --> 22:43.653
just before it goes upside your head.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.281
All right.
All right, you have it your way,

22:46.365 --> 22:49.576
but by my not wearing a helmet,
I am showing a willingness to parley

22:49.659 --> 22:51.536
that will incite trust, you'll see.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.292
How you doing there, big boy?

22:58.585 --> 22:59.419
(groans)

23:00.295 --> 23:02.798
-(shouting)
-(clattering)

23:02.881 --> 23:07.594
-MAN 1: Hey, you got him!
-(clamoring)

23:10.722 --> 23:12.557
-MAN 2: Go and get him!
-(yells)

23:13.058 --> 23:14.017
(groans)

23:17.312 --> 23:18.605
(gun shots)

23:20.899 --> 23:24.069
Everybody just stand back out of the way
while we get this guy out of here!

23:24.528 --> 23:25.862
Stand back! You too!

23:28.615 --> 23:30.033
And then we'll be out of here!

23:39.167 --> 23:41.169
What'd I tell you, man? Piece of cake.

23:49.970 --> 23:50.887
Henry?

23:52.055 --> 23:54.599
Henry, I made a list of all the things

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
Frank could have been talking about
when he said

23:56.601 --> 23:58.854
I don't show enough leadership ability.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.023
Well, a list always helps to clarify
your thinking, right?

24:02.107 --> 24:05.193
Could I show it to you, please?
I want to take it in to Frank.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.112
Are you sure he was even questioning
your leadership--

24:07.195 --> 24:11.450
I put in this column possible accusation
and here, refutation.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.577
Here, accusation.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.371
"The lieutenant failed
to prevent press leaks

24:16.455 --> 24:18.623
at the time of the Rojas homicides.

24:19.082 --> 24:23.753
Refutation. Press leaks were
result of stolen arrest reports,

24:23.837 --> 24:27.090
and it is express duty
of desk Sergeant." Esterhaus.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.885
"To keep unauthorized personnel
from the squad room."

24:30.260 --> 24:32.262
Well, I guess there's no harm
in explaining that to Frank.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.139
Here, accusation.

24:34.806 --> 24:40.353
"The lieutenant failed to notify Diablos
concerning may '79 gang summit."

24:40.812 --> 24:45.567
Explanation. "That day,
Rosa got her hand caught in toaster oven."

24:46.026 --> 24:47.527
I wasn't thinking straight.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.654
Uh, well...

24:50.697 --> 24:53.200
Sounds like you and Frank
have a lot to talk about, Ray.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.963
VIC: Okay. Yo! Yo!

25:07.047 --> 25:09.841
Check it out. Check it out.
Check the vines sweetheart.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.177
Got the whole gig. $475 and change.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.971
Four-four and seventy-five and change.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.015
-Hey, terrific, terrific.
-(laughs)

25:17.098 --> 25:19.768
Oh, you beautiful guy, you.
Is he a guy or what, huh?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.522
Listen I picked up a chick at lunch today,
has the gall to tell me I'm a lousy lover.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.148
I say, "Sweetheart, don't be ridiculous.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.192
You can't decide something
like that in two minutes."

25:27.275 --> 25:30.195
(both laugh)

25:30.278 --> 25:31.988
You gotta save this stuff!

25:32.155 --> 25:34.241
It's what you're gonna
get the big bucks for.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.244
Oh, hey, I know this guy,
owns a club over on Baldwin, huh?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.502
Yeah, yeah, Maury, hey! J.D. here.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.839
J.D. LaRue, right. Right? Right, right!

25:50.090 --> 25:52.884
Listen, hold onto your hat.
I got a hot one for you.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.886
There's a guy standing
in front of me right now

25:54.970 --> 25:58.223
who's got a 2-day window of vulnerability,
but you're gonna have to act now,

25:58.306 --> 26:00.183
or it's "see you at the Rose Parade."

26:00.809 --> 26:03.812
Hey, I'm telling you, this guy is smoking,

26:03.895 --> 26:06.606
and because it's you,
I think I can arrange a deal

26:06.690 --> 26:09.359
that'll let you see a piece
of serious change.

26:10.277 --> 26:14.364
Ladies, this is Officer Schnitz.
He's gonna be introducing group "A"

26:14.447 --> 26:18.159
to the intricacies of our
computer filing system.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.247
The guy blazes new comic frontiers
every time he opens his mouth.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.460
Okay, okay, hey, hey, don't rush me, huh?
All right, you ready? Huh?

26:28.295 --> 26:31.464
Vic... Hitler... Jr.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.094
Yeah, Hitler.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.728
-What'd he say?
-Oh, he's, uh, thinking about it.

26:45.478 --> 26:48.315
-(chuckles)
-Hey, excuse me just a minute.

26:48.398 --> 26:49.608
Whoa, where-where are you going?

26:49.691 --> 26:51.067
You stay right here
in case he calls back, huh?

26:51.151 --> 26:53.278
Those of you lucky enough
to find yourselves in group "B"

26:53.361 --> 26:56.323
can follow me
for a captivating explanation

26:56.656 --> 26:58.283
of our computer terminal.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.037
J.D.: Pst! Kristen! Kristen!

27:05.415 --> 27:08.126
-I'm supposed to be listening.
-J.D.: Forget that.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.129
You want to learn police work
out of a filing cabinet?

27:11.755 --> 27:12.881
I'm into something big.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.674
You keep quiet about it,
I'll let you in on it.

27:15.091 --> 27:15.925
What is it?

27:16.176 --> 27:18.845
How'd you like to have a firsthand look
at a stakeout?

27:21.014 --> 27:22.515
What kind of a stakeout?

27:23.016 --> 27:25.685
Loan-shark.
It's a classic loan-shark stakeout.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.354
You know,
you might have studied it in school.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.524
-I'm supposed to be here now.
-Yeah, but what about later?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.943
I mean, this could be
a really late stakeout.

27:34.903 --> 27:35.737
Where?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.281
There is a green Dodge van
that'll be parked

27:38.365 --> 27:41.368
on the north side of Dekker
just off of Edgemont. Okay?

27:41.451 --> 27:43.244
Rap on the back when you get there, okay?

27:43.328 --> 27:46.373
Here. Yeah, here's five bucks. Take a cab.

27:49.959 --> 27:50.794
Maybe.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.879
Only if you're interested
in police work, now.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.923
I mean, real undercover stuff.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.508
Yeah, I'll bet.

28:02.263 --> 28:03.973
I'm just gonna say three words, babe.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.559
Statu... tory... rape.

28:10.563 --> 28:14.609
-When are you gonna start listening?
-That is a pile of turkey droppings!

28:14.693 --> 28:16.986
The day I can't take a bop
in the head with a pool cue

28:17.070 --> 28:20.198
from some sucker looks like this
is the day I quit this depart--

28:20.281 --> 28:21.366
You tell 'em the truth, man.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.618
You know what happened down there.
You saw it.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.869
-Hey!
-Tell them I didn't do it!

28:24.953 --> 28:27.330
-Not a good idea at all!
-Man. Come on, man.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.124
Book him.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.129
Have you ever heard Officer Coffey
make racist remarks of any kind?

28:34.796 --> 28:37.132
(scoffs) Joe? Get out of here.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.591
Answer the question, please.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.427
What do you want, Joe Coffey's biography,

28:40.510 --> 28:42.178
or you want to know what happened
in the street yesterday?

28:42.262 --> 28:44.931
We need to get all the necessary
background information.

28:45.014 --> 28:48.351
Well, get it from somebody else.
I don't know his life story.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.478
Ask me, he's a good cop.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.940
Let me tell you something else.
I don't like innuendos.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.817
Like the way you guys
come sniffing around--

28:55.900 --> 28:57.652
-SHIPMAN: Officer Bates--
-And let me finish this!

28:57.736 --> 29:00.071
I don't like your assumptions.
I don't like your wide ties.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.114
I don't like it!

29:01.948 --> 29:04.284
You know, you don't even know Joe Coffey!
You don't know any of us here.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.077
You come up here like you're spitting
in our faces,

29:06.161 --> 29:07.912
like we're some kind of garbage
that goes around killing people--

29:07.996 --> 29:09.706
-Officer Bates, that's enough!
-LUCY: No, it is not enough!

29:09.789 --> 29:11.291
And most of all, I don't like it

29:11.374 --> 29:14.419
because you get paid to hang out cops,
and you enjoy it!

29:14.878 --> 29:16.963
What do you do, huh?
You notch your belt at night?

29:17.046 --> 29:19.257
You go home and count
the cop scalps on the wall?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.634
Did it ever occur to you, Officer Bates,

29:21.843 --> 29:25.638
you hate I.A.D. for precisely the same
reason the community at large hates cops?

29:25.722 --> 29:28.892
Do you respect people who hate you
when they don't even know you, Officer?

29:28.975 --> 29:32.854
Do you respect people who throw bottles
at you for doing your job?

29:36.566 --> 29:37.400
(sighs)

29:50.830 --> 29:55.710
Have you ever heard Officer Coffey
make racist remarks of any kind?

29:56.878 --> 30:01.299
No, I have never heard him
make any racist remarks.

30:02.008 --> 30:04.135
I'm delighted things seem to have
worked out.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.472
-We've been very lucky.
-This time. How many favors can you call?

30:07.680 --> 30:10.016
How many times can you bring out
the tactical nukes?

30:10.850 --> 30:13.436
This whole sordid business
is absolutely tragic.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.522
Joyce, I have advised Senator Kinney

30:15.605 --> 30:18.399
on more than one occasion
to strike preemptively,

30:18.483 --> 30:20.985
go public, cauterize the situation.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.447
It might even buy some sympathy.

30:26.491 --> 30:31.454
Joyce, the senator is understandably
concerned about unhealthily publicity.

30:32.747 --> 30:33.832
Needless to say,

30:33.915 --> 30:38.920
we all hope that your Mr. Dundee
won't approach the tabloids.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.214
I don't know anything about
his inclinations, Doug,

30:41.297 --> 30:44.384
-but I think I perceive yours.
-I'm merely suggesting.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.719
If there's any way we can sit
down with him,

30:47.762 --> 30:51.182
just talk generally about helping him
put the pieces back together.

30:51.766 --> 30:52.642
Doug, trust me,

30:53.726 --> 30:57.313
your best shot at keeping Mr. Dundee
away from the papers is to simply shut up.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.232
The moment you try to buy his silence,

30:59.315 --> 31:01.609
he'll be auctioning off the rights
to the highest bidder.

31:02.151 --> 31:05.405
I suspect you're right,
but it doesn't hurt to ask.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.158
-Clark's right, you know.
-Clark?

31:10.493 --> 31:11.536
DOUG: Word on the vine has it

31:11.619 --> 31:14.372
that you're taking a position
with the justice department.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.001
You couldn't ask for a better friend
or mentor than Clark Galloway.

31:18.751 --> 31:20.753
I am betting you will go far.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.426
Well, Dennis? Let's go home.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.357
Hey, you got some scotch tape?

31:47.196 --> 31:49.365
-(chuckles)
-Hey, breakfast, man.

31:50.074 --> 31:53.661
Hey, you know,
it seems like it took forever. (sniffs)

31:56.706 --> 31:59.459
I am gonna sue the briefs off
that cheap bastard!

31:59.751 --> 32:02.128
-Which cheap bastard, Fay?
-(sighs)

32:02.211 --> 32:05.131
Municipal Court judge Paul Grogin.

32:05.673 --> 32:06.716
FRANK: You told him you're pregnant.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.594
He had the unmitigated gall to suggest

32:09.677 --> 32:12.388
that I had talked myself
into an hysterical pregnancy.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.390
I assured him on no uncertain terms

32:14.474 --> 32:17.143
that there was nothing hysterical
about the pregnancy!

32:17.226 --> 32:19.312
-Is he gonna help out?
-FAY: Help out?

32:20.313 --> 32:22.690
He won't even admit responsibility!

32:23.232 --> 32:26.527
I mean, he kept referring to it
as this alleged pregnancy,

32:26.903 --> 32:29.197
and then he gave me the number
of his cousin Milton,

32:29.572 --> 32:34.661
who runs what he euphemistically calls
a "pregnancy counseling service."

32:35.036 --> 32:37.956
And then he offered me $2,500
if I'd go see him.

32:38.581 --> 32:42.377
I may have been born at night, Frank,
but I wasn't born<i> last </i>night.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.963
The man's an abortionist!

32:45.254 --> 32:47.423
And I don't have to review
my position on that!

32:47.507 --> 32:48.341
No.

32:50.093 --> 32:55.640
And then,
he had the nerve to say that if in fact

32:55.723 --> 33:00.520
this alleged pregnancy is false,
I could keep the $2,500.

33:02.105 --> 33:05.858
I told him that he could stuff
the $2,500 up his alleged--

33:05.942 --> 33:06.901
Fay.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.488
Then I spent the whole rest of the day

33:10.571 --> 33:13.074
going from one social-service agency
to the other,

33:13.491 --> 33:15.994
and they told me that
unless my income is zero,

33:16.077 --> 33:18.287
I don't qualify for any kind
of aid whatsoever.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.083
In other words, Frank, what they're
telling me is that I don't exist!

33:22.166 --> 33:24.752
Maybe they're trying to tell you
you shouldn't have this child.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.591
I have never felt so alone
and rejected in my whole life.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.136
Fay, I assure you, you're not alone.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.638
FAY: And I'm grateful for that, Frank.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.599
-Oh!
-What? What's the matter?

33:39.142 --> 33:40.435
(whines) I'm gonna be sick!

33:44.397 --> 33:46.941
Hi, Fay! Whoa, hey, Fay.
What's the matter?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.359
Nothing's the matter, Henry.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.820
I'm pregnant,
and I'm about to lose my lunch!

33:52.447 --> 33:53.364
Henry.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.203
Frank, the meeting
with Reverend Banks' group

33:59.287 --> 34:01.039
will be at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

34:01.330 --> 34:04.500
-Here?
-RAY: No, we agreed on Holy Christ church.

34:04.917 --> 34:07.837
I contacted councilman Majoris' office.
He will be there.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.630
Chief Daniels is a problem.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.760
Good work, Ray,
really excellent on such short notice.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.845
-I mean it.
-Thank you, Captain.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.682
-There anything else?
-FRANK: Yes, there is.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.310
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to talk to you about--

34:22.393 --> 34:25.480
Uh, excuse me, Captain.
Sorry to interrupt, Lieutenant.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.649
We just got word that
Mick Belker's dad passed away.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.821
-Mick doesn't know?
-I don't think so. He's out on stakeout.

34:34.238 --> 34:36.699
-Where?
-LEO: 137th, north of Hurdle.

34:37.450 --> 34:41.871
I'll go. Uh, Ray, I'm sorry, uh...

34:42.538 --> 34:44.832
Maybe later this afternoon
or tomorrow morning?

34:45.833 --> 34:46.751
Of course, Frank.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.264
Hey, sugar, how much money
you got in that coin cup?

35:00.348 --> 35:04.227
-Beat it, street meat.
-Fifteen, seventeen dollars?

35:05.061 --> 35:08.356
I could steam-clean
and press you for that, huh?

35:08.439 --> 35:12.276
Hey, I gotta work, you gotta work, right?

35:15.113 --> 35:18.407
-Are you really blind, sugar?
-Yes, I am.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.751
This is for you, sugar.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.380
-Move it!
-Hey!

35:32.463 --> 35:33.506
We got 'em. Let's move.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.050
Hey! Give me back my tip!

35:36.634 --> 35:40.847
(indistinct shouting)

35:48.229 --> 35:50.314
(growling)

35:55.653 --> 35:58.781
(growling)

36:03.119 --> 36:06.372
You are busted, barf bag!

36:16.549 --> 36:17.884
Move 'em over, boys.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.434
You're the new backup, Captain?

36:26.934 --> 36:28.352
Why don't you let them take 'em, Mick?

36:28.436 --> 36:31.063
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.404
-Yes, sir?
-(clears throat) Mick, uh...

36:41.365 --> 36:42.533
What's the matter, Captain?

36:44.493 --> 36:46.454
It's your father. He passed away.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.332
I'm very sorry, Mick.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.669
That's good work here.
We'll take over now, though.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.422
Go see your mother, okay?

37:16.651 --> 37:20.863
(thunder rumbles)

37:23.699 --> 37:28.120
Frank. I understand you guys
picked up that biker.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.666
Good. That's good. You're gonna need him.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.212
I got Tatum's autopsy, Frank,
hot off the press.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.423
(sighs)

37:41.008 --> 37:45.638
Frank... he's dead. (laughs)

37:53.604 --> 37:56.232
Lighten up, kid! You'll live longer!

37:58.484 --> 38:02.196
-Come on, Wally, what does it say?
-(laughs) All right.

38:03.364 --> 38:09.245
It says, uh... (muttering)

38:10.413 --> 38:12.790
Bite marks on his shoulder. Here we go.
(clears throat)

38:13.249 --> 38:16.836
"Strangled from behind,
no bar burns on the back of the neck.

38:16.919 --> 38:19.463
No fingerprints, ring,
or jewelry marks on the neck.

38:19.547 --> 38:24.135
Victim died from fractured cricoid
in the first tracheal ring."

38:24.468 --> 38:26.470
As advertised, Lynn Tatum did not die

38:26.554 --> 38:28.264
from what happened out
on the street, Frank.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.181
You sure?

38:30.099 --> 38:34.270
An injury like that,
you lose air, can't breathe.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.732
Fifteen, 20 minutes, tops, you're dead.

38:37.815 --> 38:40.192
Lynn Tatum died from what happened
in the cell, Frank.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.737
-To a medical certainty?
-WALLY: Ninety-nine percent.

38:43.738 --> 38:48.409
It's all there in black and white.
As to the time, place, cause.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.497
-I worked hard on that, Frank.
-What's the bottom line, Wally?

38:54.832 --> 38:59.545
Bottom line: They could make a case
against your cop, Frank.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.841
Circumstantial, but it, uh, might float.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.929
You'd better pray your witness
tells the truth, kid.

39:10.723 --> 39:14.643
(sighs) So the dude keeps giving the cop
noise, and the cop goes into his cell.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.979
ALVAREZ:
Can you describe the police officer?

39:17.229 --> 39:20.483
Yeah, he's 6'2, black curly hair.
He's a guinea.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.653
The officer goes into the cell.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.823
Yeah, he comes into the cell,
and the cop says, "Shut up!"

39:28.783 --> 39:31.410
So the dude pushes him,
and the cop pushes the dude back,

39:31.494 --> 39:34.413
and the cop whacks him,
and then he chokes him.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.540
Cop chokes him with his fingers
or with his whole arm?

39:37.041 --> 39:41.629
With his, uh, with his whole arm,
like, uh, this, about a half a minute.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.964
From in back of the guy or in front?

39:44.340 --> 39:46.175
From in back of the guy,
which, if you ask me,

39:46.258 --> 39:48.302
the cop took more than
he should have anyway.

39:49.303 --> 39:53.057
So, uh, so anyway,
then the cop comes over to me.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.267
The-the officer came into your cell?

39:55.351 --> 39:58.646
No, no, he points at me through
the bars, and he says, uh,

39:58.729 --> 40:00.022
"You saw not a thing.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.858
You say you saw anything,
and you're a dead man."

40:02.942 --> 40:04.652
Where was the prisoner Tatum at this time?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.239
-He stumbled onto his bunk.
-What was his condition?

40:08.864 --> 40:11.075
Uh, he's out.
I mean, the cop cooled him out.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.577
Which now you should tell me
the cop croaked him.

40:13.661 --> 40:17.498
(sighs) All right, what, if anything,
happened subsequently?

40:18.040 --> 40:20.292
Later, they let me out, you know,
'cause I'm in on a hummer anyway,

40:20.376 --> 40:21.919
which is a false arrest.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.380
All right, when they came to release you,

40:24.463 --> 40:27.133
did the khaki officers, uh,
see to Tatum in any way?

40:29.009 --> 40:30.678
Respond verbally, please.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.139
No, I mean, I mean,
they may have looked at him.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.599
ALVAREZ: They didn't talk to him
or anything like that.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.733
(sighs) Mr. Crockett,
it could be in your interests

40:44.817 --> 40:47.278
and certainly in ours if you'd agree
to take a polygraph.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.448
Hell, no, I ain't gonna take a polygraph.
What good's that gonna do me?

40:50.614 --> 40:52.032
ALVAREZ: Well,
assuming what you're saying is true.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.075
There's no reason for my client--

40:53.159 --> 40:54.952
What happens if I get nervous,
if I jam up?

40:55.035 --> 40:58.414
-We have ways to discount--
-Mr. Alvarez, are we through?

40:59.540 --> 41:01.834
Because I have a 6:30 appointment
in midtown.

41:03.335 --> 41:05.629
All right, we'll have further questions
for Mr. Crockett later.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.466
Meanwhile, he'll be charged
on resisting and assault.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.852
I've gotta take it
to the grand jury, Frank.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.521
The guy has nine priors.
He won't even take a polygraph.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.441
It doesn't matter if the jury
believes him or not. I can't just sit.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.401
At least wait for the final forensics.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.362
Look, microfiber and the autopsy
will be in in the morning.

41:30.446 --> 41:32.323
-Tomorrow afternoon--
-We have the autopsy.

41:33.908 --> 41:37.703
-ALVAREZ: Oh?
-Whatever happened happened downstairs.

41:38.704 --> 41:40.706
As for identifying the murderer,
it's inconclusive.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.167
(scoffs) It doesn't change the fact
that we have an eyewitness

41:43.250 --> 41:44.376
who saw your man do it.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.213
Now, tomorrow afternoon,
I'm taking Crockett into the jury.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.341
(thunder rumbles)

41:52.134 --> 41:55.596
(siren wailing)

42:08.817 --> 42:09.735
(knocking on door)

42:17.451 --> 42:19.495
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

42:19.578 --> 42:22.331
-No problem. We got forever.
-I had to feed my cat.

42:27.836 --> 42:30.673
-So, this is a stakeout.
-Uh-huh, yep.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.425
Oh, hey, here, take a look through there.

42:36.303 --> 42:39.974
What am I supposed to be looking at?
They seem like a bunch of winos.

42:40.057 --> 42:43.227
Oh, no, hey, any one of them guys
could be a perpetrator.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.983
-(clicks radio)
-(soft music plays)

42:49.066 --> 42:50.943
So, you ever like to take pictures?

42:51.026 --> 42:53.070
You and your boyfriend
ever take any pictures?

42:53.946 --> 42:57.992
-You mean, like, birthday pictures?
-Yeah, birthday or at night.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.246
-At the beach.
-Oh, yeah, the beach, sure.

43:02.580 --> 43:05.124
-During the day or at night?
-You know, whatever.

43:06.333 --> 43:09.837
-In a bathing suit?
-Oh, a bathing suit, yeah, or whatever.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.464
-Whatever.
-Uh-huh.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.677
-No, we never took those kind of pictures.
-Hm. Never did, huh?

43:18.637 --> 43:20.598
-You're funny.
-Think so?

43:22.182 --> 43:25.227
-Can I call you John?
-Oh, yeah, hey, call me anything you like.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.316
-Uh, I've been mature since I was 12.
-Uh-huh.

43:31.150 --> 43:34.069
The men I'm interested in are always a lot
older than I am.

43:34.987 --> 43:40.576
Yeah, well, you know, they're so much...
they're more... older.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.998
Listen to me. I like you a lot.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.793
-Great. Great.
-(chuckles)

43:50.878 --> 43:54.214
But, I have to be a virgin
for the man I marry.

43:56.717 --> 44:00.638
I can relate to that.
I can even respect that.

44:01.513 --> 44:04.516
-You can?
-Sort of.

44:07.227 --> 44:12.399
That... that doesn't mean that
we can't make each other happy.

44:20.699 --> 44:24.453
-Kristen... I gotta go.
-(siren wailing)

44:39.176 --> 44:41.220
(on TV)
<i>...Have continued their investigation</i>

44:41.303 --> 44:44.306
<i>into the circumstances surrounding</i>
<i>the death of Lynn Tatum,</i>

44:44.598 --> 44:46.934
<i>which occurred yesterday</i>
<i>in a holding facility</i>

44:47.017 --> 44:49.228
<i>of the Hill Street precinct station house.</i>

44:49.937 --> 44:54.400
<i>Channel 6 has not yet been able to confirm</i>
<i>what is believed to be a reliable rumor</i>

44:54.608 --> 44:57.319
<i>that the district attorney believes</i>
<i>there is enough evidence</i>

44:57.528 --> 45:01.240
<i>to charge one or more police officers</i>
<i>in the in-custody death.</i>

45:04.451 --> 45:05.327
I turned it down.

45:07.037 --> 45:11.166
I told Clark that if I was going
to rotate my life 180 degrees,

45:11.709 --> 45:13.377
it would have to be for a job profile

45:13.460 --> 45:16.296
with a lot more human consequence
than antitrust.

45:16.880 --> 45:18.632
I also turned it down because of us...

45:20.634 --> 45:23.387
-Which still doesn't solve our problem.
-I know.

45:26.390 --> 45:29.059
Something's happened
in the last few days, Frank.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.732
The man I love, the man I've known...

45:36.024 --> 45:38.777
for the past four years
seems to have left town.

45:39.027 --> 45:41.697
I'm not nominating myself
for any medals, Joyce,

45:41.780 --> 45:44.450
b-but I think you have to shoulder
some of the responsibility

45:44.533 --> 45:45.534
for the way I've been acting.

45:45.617 --> 45:48.954
Me? I'm not the one
making sleazy innuendos

45:49.037 --> 45:51.623
about where the woman I love
and supposedly trust was sleeping

45:51.707 --> 45:55.377
on her trip to Washington
or asking if I had a second-string lover

45:55.461 --> 45:57.337
when I just wanted to spend
last night alone!

45:57.421 --> 46:00.716
If I've been making innuendos
it's because for the last three years

46:00.799 --> 46:03.677
every time I've raised the possibility
of deepening our relationship,

46:03.761 --> 46:07.181
you made me feel I was pressuring you!
Then when I question you about this job,

46:07.264 --> 46:10.225
about what it might mean for us,
you accuse me of being jealous!

46:10.309 --> 46:14.021
Joyce, you've let me know time after time
that my feelings make you anxious,

46:14.104 --> 46:15.689
that you don't want to hear
about my needs.

46:15.773 --> 46:19.568
That is not true!
I've tried my damnedest to balance things,

46:19.651 --> 46:21.612
and you're not giving me any credit
at all!

46:21.945 --> 46:24.448
What the hell do you call
what we've had for four years?

46:24.907 --> 46:27.576
A shadow dance,
(stammers) a series of accommodations.

46:27.659 --> 46:30.746
(scoffs) Is that all you think, Frank?

46:30.829 --> 46:36.168
No, not entirely.
I just feel things slipping away.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.170
And I feel like you're ripping us apart,

46:38.253 --> 46:40.631
like you're throwing
what we have out the window.

46:40.923 --> 46:44.134
Frank, trying to have a professional
and a personal life is hard.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.428
It means sacrifices.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.306
Don't make me the heavy
because I tried to strike a balance!

46:49.389 --> 46:52.476
FRANK: And-and you've done it!
You pulled it off!

46:53.435 --> 46:57.689
But all you seem to want now
is-is to maintain the status quo.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.817
Joyce, people reach a point

46:59.900 --> 47:02.444
where they're either going forward
or they're going back.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.571
We have to reach for something more.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.450
Otherwise, what we have now
is just gonna turn sour, angry.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.993
Don't you think I've wanted to?

47:10.661 --> 47:13.622
Don't you think I've thought about it
for hours and hours every night?

47:15.791 --> 47:17.793
-Every night?
-(chuckles softly)

47:22.714 --> 47:23.549
(sniffles)

47:25.843 --> 47:28.554
-I'm afraid.
-I am, too.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.889
Anybody with any sense would be.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.227
I'm not talking about
general misgivings, Frank.

47:36.353 --> 47:37.771
We've both been divorced.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.026
(voice breaking) Don't you know that
I love you, for God's sake?

47:43.485 --> 47:44.653
I love you, too.

47:45.571 --> 47:48.240
Frank, I just don't want us
to lose what we've got.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.201
That's the only thing I'm afraid of.

47:55.664 --> 47:58.458
I love you, Joyce.
I want to make a life with you.

48:00.002 --> 48:01.420
I want us to be married.

48:05.674 --> 48:06.925
I'm not saying no.

48:09.761 --> 48:12.556
-Let me wrestle with it.
-(chuckles)

48:15.434 --> 48:17.603
-Wrestle alone?
-(chuckles)

48:33.285 --> 48:37.414
(closing theme playing)
