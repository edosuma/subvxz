12:29.415 --> 12:31.040
ALL ERIC EVER
WANTS TO DO IS TALK.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.334
I TOLD YOU HE
WAS A LOSER.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.753
I KNOW.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.087
I MEAN, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO TALK

12:36.255 --> 12:37.338
WHEN I DON'T
HAVE A THOUGHT

12:37.506 --> 12:40.258
IN MY PRETTY LITTLE
RED HEAD?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.302
SEE, MICHAEL?

12:42.470 --> 12:45.305
DONNA'S JUST AS
EMPTY-HEADED AS WE ARE.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.307
OH, DONNA, YOU'LL MAKE
A GREAT ADDITION

12:47.475 --> 12:50.143
TO OUR SEXY CIRCLE.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.479
ALL RIGHT, LADIES. THERE'S
JUST ONE RULE HERE.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.315
THERE ARE NO
BRAS ALLOWED.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.193
All: YAY!

13:02.490 --> 13:05.366
SEE, THAT'S PRETTY SWEET, HUH?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.540
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.167
[CLEARS THROAT]

13:14.335 --> 13:18.213
I THINK IT MAKES
YOUR ASS LOOK BIG.

13:21.717 --> 13:26.179
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
MY DAD DOESN'T WANT ME TO WORK.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.223
I MEAN, YEAH,
I'M A REAL BAD BOY, DONNA.

13:28.390 --> 13:32.769
MY BIG TEENAGE REBELLION
IS TO GET A JOB.

13:34.730 --> 13:38.358
OOH, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO NEXT.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.318
OH, MY GOD, LOOK OUT.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.488
HE'S GOT INSURANCE.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.700
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'LL BE
GREAT WHEN YOU GET A JOB.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.411
MAYBE ON OUR DATES WE WON'T
HAVE TO JUST SIT IN THE CAR.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.330
MAYBE WE CAN ACTUALLY
DRIVE SOMEWHERE

13:52.498 --> 13:55.124
AND MAYBE,
I DON'T KNOW, EAT?

13:55.292 --> 13:59.420
OR MAYBE I CAN GET MY OWN
POPCORN AT THE MOVIES.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.382
YOU'RE A DREAMER.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.136
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.806
I'M GOING TO KEEP THE JOB.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.100
WOW, YOU'RE LIKE
A REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE...

14:12.268 --> 14:14.519
BUT WITH A CAUSE.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.188
AND A SMOCK.
RIGHT.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.150
YOU GOT TO HIDE ME.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.111
Laurie: KELSO,
ARE YOU DOWN THERE?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.822
CRAP! I'M NOT HERE.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.577
HAVE YOU SEEN KELSO?

14:30.744 --> 14:32.036
WHY, YES, I HAVE.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.830
HE'S HIDING FROM
YOU IN THE SHOWER.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.082
OH!

14:39.879 --> 14:41.087
HI.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.505
GUESS WHAT!

14:42.673 --> 14:44.299
I JUST FOUND MY
EIGHTH GRADE DIARY.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.843
COME ON,
I'LL READ IT TO YOU.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.219
GREAT!

14:48.387 --> 14:50.680
HEY, FORMAN.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.935
GOOD NEWS, RED.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.772
I JUST TOOK COSMO'S "10 WAYS TO
PLEASE YOUR MAN IN BED" TEST

14:59.940 --> 15:04.360
AND I GOT 9 OUT OF 10.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.404
BUT I DIDN'T GET NUMBER 3
BECAUSE I'M A NURSE

15:06.572 --> 15:10.116
AND NUMBER 3 IS ICKY.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.207
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ERIC.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.876
OH, I THINK WORKING
IS IMPORTANT

15:20.044 --> 15:21.377
TO ERIC'S SELF-ESTEEM,

15:21.545 --> 15:22.837
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.673
BUT HE ONLY GOT A JOB, KITTY,
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ONE.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.759
AND NO SON OF MINE
IS GOING TO WORK

15:27.927 --> 15:30.094
AND SCREW UP HIS CHANCES
TO GO TO A GOOD COLLEGE

15:30.262 --> 15:32.347
'CAUSE I CAN'T
CARRY THE LOAD.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.141
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT
CRUMMY CASHIER'S JOB.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.726
OH, NOW WHAT KIND
OF TALK IS THAT?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.603
YOU DESERVE
TO BE SUPERVISOR.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.063
IN FACT, THE RED FORMAN
I KNOW

15:40.230 --> 15:43.232
WOULD MARCH RIGHT DOWN
THERE AND FIGHT FOR IT.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.026
I'VE BEEN OUT OF WORK
FOR 6 MONTHS.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.946
I CAN'T AFFORD TO FIGHT
RIGHT NOW, KITTY.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.490
I'VE GOT TO TAKE
THEIR CRAPPY OFFER

15:50.658 --> 15:54.494
AND SMILE LIKE
A JACKASS WHILE I DO IT.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.705
RED, I DON'T THINK
YOUR SMILE IS GOING TO...

15:57.873 --> 15:59.540
OH, I'M GOING
FOR A WALK.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.001
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE,
HONEY.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.462
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE CAN
SPLIT A BOTTLE OF WINE,

16:04.630 --> 16:08.299
AND I'LL GIVE
NUMBER 3 A SHOT.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.727
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.862
DID YOU QUIT THAT JOB?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.447
DAD, I WANT
TO KEEP THAT JOB.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.741
WELL, IT'S
A TOUGH WORLD, ERIC.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.284
AND PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS
GET WHAT THEY WANT.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.037
ESPECIALLY YOU.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.666
DAD, I'M PRETTY SURE I'M NOT
BACKING DOWN ON THIS ONE.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.587
YOU'RE NOT?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.007
OH, NO.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.261
WELL, I GUESS
YOU WIN, THEN.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.514
DAD, YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
NEVER TO BACK DOWN.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.807
DON'T BACK DOWN.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.267
FORMANS NEVER BACK DOWN.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.561
AND NOW YOU'RE
TELLING ME TO BACK DOWN?

17:01.729 --> 17:04.605
WELL, DAD, I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE
THAT YOU'RE INSANE.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.858
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.276
WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL

17:08.444 --> 17:09.861
HA HA SENSE,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.779
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF...

17:11.947 --> 17:13.281
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.158
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO LOOK REAL FUNNY

17:15.325 --> 17:16.534
WHEN YOU'RE WEARING...

17:16.702 --> 17:19.787
Both: YOUR ASS FOR A HAT.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.207
EVEN THOUGH I DOUBT
THAT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.252
LET'S FIND OUT TOGETHER.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.757
OKAY, LAURIE,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

17:30.924 --> 17:33.760
THAT I REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY

17:33.927 --> 17:36.471
ENJOY FOOLING AROUND
WITH YOU.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.182
YEAH, I GET THAT A LOT.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.975
AND YOU SHOULD.
'CAUSE YOU'RE TALENTED.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.645
SEE, BUT I DON'T WANT ONE OF
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

17:44.813 --> 17:46.898
BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE
ONE OF THOSE WITH JACKIE.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.357
YEAH, BUT THAT
CAN'T LAST.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.692
NO.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.069
SEE, WHAT I'M
SAYING IS,

17:51.236 --> 17:53.488
IS THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK
THIS THING OFF.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.117
HUH.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.371
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DECISION
TO MAKE ALL ON YOUR OWN.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.957
MAYBE YOU AND ME
AND JACKIE

18:05.125 --> 18:07.585
SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER
AND DISCUSS IT.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.754
NO. YOU WOULDN'T.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.464
REALLY?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.132
LOOK AT ME, KELSO.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.220
LOOK INTO MY EYES.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.904
LAURIE, WILL YOU
GO OUT WITH ME?

18:35.072 --> 18:38.574
OH, KELSO. I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.124
IT'S A SMART MOVE,
TAKING CASHIER.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.376
I KNOW YOU WERE GUNNING
FOR SUPERVISOR, BUT...

18:48.544 --> 18:51.629
HEY, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN BACKING DOWN.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.969
WELL, THAT IS
A MIGHTY NICE SMOCK.

19:00.848 --> 19:05.601
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK THAT YOUR
KIDS DON'T LISTEN TO YOU...

19:05.769 --> 19:07.186
BUT THEY DO.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.771
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.940
I CHANGED MY MIND, TED.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.442
I'M HERE
FOR THE SUPERVISOR'S JOB.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.363
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:17.531 --> 19:20.408
TED?

19:22.077 --> 19:24.495
OKAY, WELL, NOW YOUR
FATHER SHOULD BE BACK

19:24.663 --> 19:27.290
FROM HIS INTERVIEW
ANY MINUTE NOW.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.083
MOM, HOW COME WE
HAVE TO BE HERE?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.586
I COULD BE USING
THIS TIME TO...

19:31.753 --> 19:34.172
NOT BE HERE.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.883
NO, THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
DAY FOR YOUR FATHER,

19:37.050 --> 19:38.676
AND HE NEEDS TO BE
WITH HIS FAMILY.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.969
I'LL BE IN THE BASEMENT.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.888
NO, YOU SIT!

19:42.055 --> 19:44.807
OH, SURE, WHEN THINGS GET
UGLY, SUDDENLY I'M FAMILY.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.896
NOT TO ME, FREAK.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.858
YOU ARE SO GOING
TO END UP IN PORNO.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.868
HI, HONEY.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.746
RIGHT TO THE BAR.
NOT A GOOD SIGN.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.917
WHAT ARE YOU
ALL LOOKING AT?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.752
DON'T YOU THINK THAT

20:12.920 --> 20:16.255
PRICEMART'S NEW SUPERVISOR
DESERVES A DRINK?

20:16.423 --> 20:19.217
YAY!

20:20.719 --> 20:22.511
YEAH, I GOT IT.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.514
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS, DAD.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.891
THANKS, ERIC.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.936
OH, AND YOU'RE FIRED!

20:32.481 --> 20:33.814
WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.525
YES, I CAN.
YOU'RE FIRED!

20:37.945 --> 20:41.030
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT FIRED.

20:42.157 --> 20:46.827
OKAY, IF IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO
YOU, YOU'RE NOT FIRED.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.413
BUT IF YOUR GRADES
START TO SLIP,

20:49.581 --> 20:51.749
YOU ARE FIRED!

20:51.917 --> 20:54.502
I LOVE SAYING THAT.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.172
GOD HELP THE POOR BASTARDS
THAT WORK FOR YOU, HUH?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.342
WAIT, UH, I WORK FOR YOU.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.428
I KNOW.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.141
SO, DAD, YOU AND ME
GOING TO WORK TOGETHER.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.727
WHAT A NIGHTMARE, HUH?

21:11.895 --> 21:13.521
OH, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT?

21:13.689 --> 21:16.190
THEY SPELLED
YOUR NAME WRONG.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.570
JUST DOESN'T
GET OLD, DOES IT?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.657
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
BENEDICT AND ARNOLD.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.368
BOB, I NEEDED THAT JOB,
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET THAT,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.371
WELL, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE A DUMB-ASS.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.331
LOOK, THEY MISSPELLED
PRICEMART.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.791
YOU WANT TO KEEP
THAT FINGER?

21:33.959 --> 21:37.837
UH-HUH.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.590
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
GOOFING AROUND, KELSO.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.301
AM I RIGHT, JACKIE?

21:43.468 --> 21:45.136
LAURIE IS SO RIGHT,
MICHAEL.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.221
WE ARE VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.266
EVEN ERIC GOT A JOB.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.644
YEAH, EVEN MY STUPID
BROTHER GOT A JOB.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.772
YEAH, HER BROTHER'S STUPID
AND HE GOT A JOB.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.984
SEXY CIRCLE?!

22:00.777 --> 22:02.570
OH!
