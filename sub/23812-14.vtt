08:41.854 --> 08:43.773
I would have showered.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.444
- So, what's new, Arc?

08:48.527 --> 08:50.238
- Bad news.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.199
My father thinks that
I should quit knight school.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.284
- But you can't.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.746
You're the most promising
student in knight school--

08:58.829 --> 09:01.332
after Ciara.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.250
- Really? You're that
impressed with Arc?

09:02.333 --> 09:06.545
- Yes. Not as much
as Ciara, but...

09:06.629 --> 09:08.798
if Arc would
leave the kingdom,

09:08.881 --> 09:12.468
the Royal Family
would be so bummed out.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.928
- Well, after
hearing this,

09:14.011 --> 09:15.972
I wouldn't dream of taking
you out of knight school.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.598
- Excellent!

09:17.682 --> 09:18.933
I'm just gonna
go find Ciara

09:19.016 --> 09:20.893
and tell her how she's
slightly better than Arc.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.148
- I'm sorry, son.
I was wrong.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.859
- I am so glad
you understand, Dad.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.820
- You've befriended
the Princess--

09:30.903 --> 09:33.489
so that you could
rob her blind.

09:33.572 --> 09:35.408
- BOTH:
[laughing]

09:35.491 --> 09:36.826
- What?

09:36.909 --> 09:40.329
- And I'm totally
gonna help you do it.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.165
- Oh, this keeps
getting better.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.750
- BOTH:
[laughing]

09:46.711 --> 09:48.504
- [footsteps running]

09:50.089 --> 09:51.173
- Yay! Our plan worked!

09:51.257 --> 09:52.883
You get to stay
in knight school!

09:52.967 --> 09:53.968
Firework fairies!

09:54.051 --> 09:56.387
- [fireworks zapping]
- ARC: Oooh...

09:56.470 --> 09:58.556
Ahhh...

09:58.639 --> 10:00.599
Our plan didn't work.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.851
- What do you mean?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.436
- My dad thinks
I've been plotting

10:03.519 --> 10:05.187
to steal from
the Princess.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.772
He even wants
to stay and help.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.482
- What did he say
when you told him

10:08.566 --> 10:09.817
you'd never do that?

10:11.652 --> 10:14.739
- A funny story,
actually.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.699
- You didn't stand
up to him.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.534
- No.
- Arc!

10:18.617 --> 10:20.244
- Look, he was
so proud of me

10:20.328 --> 10:22.496
when he thought I was
returning to a life of crime.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.165
- But that's not you.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.583
- No, but...

10:25.666 --> 10:27.960
I mean, it's who
my family is.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.463
If I turn my back
on my dad,

10:30.546 --> 10:31.005
it'll destroy him.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.132
- I understand.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.217
But if you steal from me,
I will destroy you!

10:36.135 --> 10:38.929
- Hey, maybe there's
a way to fix this

10:39.013 --> 10:40.222
without stealing
from you

10:40.306 --> 10:41.724
or breaking
my father's heart.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.310
- Tell me your plan,
or I will destroy you!

10:44.393 --> 10:48.064
Sorry. I'm on
a destroying kick right now.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.148
- Okay, my father and
I will go to your room

10:49.231 --> 10:51.275
to steal the tiaras,

10:51.359 --> 10:53.152
but you will have
already moved them...

10:53.235 --> 10:56.197
...with magic!

10:56.280 --> 10:58.407
- Or I could just
move them, myself.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.867
- Boring, but fine.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.662
Okay, then I'll tell
my dad to leave

11:03.746 --> 11:05.623
while I spend the next year
searching for the tiaras.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.125
- What happens when
your dad comes back?

11:08.209 --> 11:09.585
- Aw, that's next
year's problem.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.755
- [magic whooshing]

11:12.838 --> 11:15.007
- [lively dance
music continues]

11:15.091 --> 11:16.675
- Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

11:16.759 --> 11:18.052
Let's ra-a-a-a-age!

11:18.135 --> 11:21.263
Yeah! Ha ha!

11:21.347 --> 11:23.265
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

11:23.349 --> 11:26.435
Yeah! Woo! Yeah!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.354
- When that party
animal touches people,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.523
they party like animals.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.109
Oh, I see.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.569
- Hey, guys!
Check it out!

11:35.653 --> 11:37.154
It's raining shields!

11:37.238 --> 11:38.072
Ha ha ha ha!

11:38.155 --> 11:41.742
Yeah! Ha ha!

11:41.826 --> 11:44.078
Yeah! Yeah!

11:44.161 --> 11:46.122
- If he keeps throwing
stuff over the cliff,

11:46.205 --> 11:48.457
Sir Gareth's gonna know
we had a party.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.792
Stop him, Prudy.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.710
- I'm not touching
that thing!

11:51.794 --> 11:52.586
If he turns me into
a party animal,

11:52.670 --> 11:55.464
I will knock
the whole castle down.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.299
- [dance music continues]

11:57.383 --> 11:58.551
- Woo! Ha ha!

11:58.634 --> 11:59.218
Your party's awesome!

11:59.301 --> 12:01.554
And a little scary.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.680
You should get Sage.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.473
She'll know how
to fix this.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.599
Woo!

12:06.434 --> 12:08.352
- We're not getting
Sage, right?

12:08.436 --> 12:09.687
- Of course not.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.688
Let's just use Slobwick

12:10.771 --> 12:12.565
to chase away
that party animal.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.567
- Hey, little furry dude.

12:14.650 --> 12:18.487
Let's pa-a-a-arty!
Ha ha ha ha!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.739
- SLOBWICK:
Yeah!

12:20.823 --> 12:22.032
[chattering]

12:22.116 --> 12:23.409
[slobber spraying]

12:25.453 --> 12:27.580
- Okay, yeah.
Let's go get Sage.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.415
- Uh-huh.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.041
- [magic whooshing]

12:34.170 --> 12:35.671
- Ka-booyah!
- Kwa-zow!

12:37.840 --> 12:41.010
You know, we maybe shouldn't
yell our catch phrases

12:41.093 --> 12:42.136
when we're trying
to be sneaky.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.138
- Good call.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.515
Let's get those tiaras.
[laughing]

12:46.599 --> 12:46.807
- Okay.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.813
[gasping]
It's empty.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.691
Gosh! Dang! Darn it!

12:55.774 --> 12:56.317
Ahhhh!

12:56.400 --> 12:58.527
I'm so disappointed.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.156
- What terrible person
would steal those tiaras--

13:02.239 --> 13:05.117
before we got
a chance to steal them?

13:05.201 --> 13:06.660
- I have no idea.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.039
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

13:11.790 --> 13:13.167
Sorry, I've got a...

13:13.250 --> 13:15.711
I've got a bad case
of the bird cough.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.715
- Thank you, Ciara,
for moving my tiaras

13:19.798 --> 13:20.466
to the summer castle.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.593
You have once
again proven

13:22.676 --> 13:24.261
you are slightly
better than Arc.

13:26.305 --> 13:26.805
- Oh, Princess,
are you okay?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.682
I heard a weird bird.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.392
[gasping]

13:30.476 --> 13:32.770
Good heavens, the bird
stole your tiaras!

13:32.853 --> 13:36.941
I'll have the guards
arrest all the birds.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.277
- Daddy, they're not stolen.
I had them moved.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.570
And I don't need tiaras

13:41.654 --> 13:43.906
when I have the most valuable
thing in the kingdom--

13:43.989 --> 13:45.741
my dear, sweet Dad!

13:45.824 --> 13:47.576
- [gasps]
Oh!

13:47.660 --> 13:50.663
You say
the sweetest things.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.706
Come on, let's go look
at your baby pictures.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.004
- Well, that settles it.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.881
Dad, you go home,
and I'll find those tiaras,

14:00.965 --> 14:04.093
while pretending to
be a knight school student.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.303
- No, son,
you heard the Princess.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.681
There's something even
more valuable here.

14:08.764 --> 14:09.765
- The baby pictures?

14:09.848 --> 14:11.725
Oh, no, Dad, trust me.
You don't want those.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.477
She was a very
awkward baby.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.564
- I'm talking
about her dad.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.690
We'll capture the King

14:17.773 --> 14:19.650
and then trade him for
a ridiculous amount of gold.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.528
I call it "Operation
Capture the King

14:22.611 --> 14:23.862
and Trade Him For
a Ridiculous Amount of Gold."

14:26.365 --> 14:28.701
- I call it "Operation,
Oh, No, What Have I Done?"

14:32.204 --> 14:33.747
- ♪ Na na na na ♪

14:33.831 --> 14:34.582
♪ Oh ♪

14:34.665 --> 14:36.458
- Okay, Arc, let's
go over the plan

14:36.542 --> 14:40.129
using this perfect diorama
of the castle courtyard.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.590
- I've gotta say it, Dad.
You are really crafty.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.677
- Now, every night,
the King and the Princess

14:46.760 --> 14:48.178
go on a cake run.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.680
Now this muffin
is the King.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.808
And this mini-muffin
is the Princess.

14:52.891 --> 14:57.229
These two potatoes
are the King's guards.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.190
Now they run ahead
with the cake

15:00.274 --> 15:02.151
and the King
chases afterwards.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.236
Once they're outside,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.654
I slam the gate shut,

15:05.738 --> 15:06.739
and now that
he's defenseless,

15:06.822 --> 15:08.949
we just snatch
up the King

15:09.033 --> 15:10.993
and zip line to rich town.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.661
[laughing]

15:12.745 --> 15:14.622
- [fake laughter]

15:16.665 --> 15:18.083
- Okay, I'm gonna rig
the castle gate.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.420
- All right,
I'll, uh...

15:21.503 --> 15:22.963
I'll meet you
down there--

15:23.047 --> 15:24.590
right after
I throw up.

15:28.802 --> 15:29.511
- What's all this?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.555
- My dad made it.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.807
It's a model of
our next heist.

15:33.891 --> 15:34.558
- Your dad's
still here?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.018
You have to stand
up to him

15:36.101 --> 15:39.146
and tell him to call
off whatever he's planning.

15:39.229 --> 15:42.691
- It's not that
easy, Ciara, okay?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.027
Seeing my dad made me realize
how much I miss him.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.572
And I don't wanna
ruin that relationship.

15:48.656 --> 15:49.657
- Arc, I get it.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.826
I have a hard time
standing up to my dad, too.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.245
- Then we'll stand up
to our dads together?

15:55.329 --> 15:57.289
- [laughing]
No way.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.708
I have a magic ring
to solve my problems.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.544
You have to decide
what you wanna do--

16:02.628 --> 16:07.049
follow your dad
or follow your dreams.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.759
- That's good advice.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.344
The Princess was right.

16:10.427 --> 16:11.178
You're slightly
better than me.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.641
- [magic whooshing]

16:17.643 --> 16:19.895
- Oh, no. I don't
see Sage anywhere.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.146
- Me, either.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.065
I just see a girl
that looks exactly like her

16:23.148 --> 16:24.733
knitting with
those old ladies.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.778
- Warwick,
that is Sage.

16:28.987 --> 16:32.741
Sage, why are you
in a knitting circle?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.077
- Oh, because I wanted
to have this sweater ready

16:35.160 --> 16:38.956
for when you came
crawling back to me for help.

16:39.039 --> 16:39.206
Ha!

16:41.166 --> 16:44.086
- Some weird party
animal guy showed up,

16:44.169 --> 16:45.754
and he's destroying
the training yard.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.965
- Unh, let me guess.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.758
Marty the Party Animal.

16:49.842 --> 16:50.467
Great dresser.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.095
Lousy party
gu-e-e-e-est.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.472
- Yeah, yeah. How do
we get rid of him?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.057
- Ah, so you do
need my help.

16:57.141 --> 17:00.769
I shall, once again,
refer to the sweater.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.937
Ha!

17:02.563 --> 17:04.606
- We're sorry.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.108
We thought we could
plan a cool party.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.608
But we should
have realized

17:07.693 --> 17:08.569
that we really
need your help.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.112
- And we do need it.
We need it real bad.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.742
- Fine.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.952
The only way to get
rid of a party animal

17:17.035 --> 17:18.287
is with a party pooper.

17:18.369 --> 17:19.621
- Clean this mess up!

17:19.704 --> 17:20.955
- [party music continues]

17:21.039 --> 17:25.002
- Turn that music off!
- [music stops]

17:25.085 --> 17:28.213
- And you guys,
get off my lawn!

17:28.297 --> 17:31.049
- [magic whooshing]

17:31.133 --> 17:31.800
- This old dude's
draining my power

17:31.884 --> 17:34.553
and killin'
my vi-i-i-ibe.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.639
- The party magic's
going away.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.892
His powers wore off.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.979
- Oh, no, Buttercup's
still infected.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.398
- Nope, that's just
Buttercup being Buttercup.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.650
- Wahoo!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.986
Sage, they're
playing my song--

17:51.069 --> 17:52.654
in my head!

17:52.738 --> 17:55.324
- Oh, yes, I can
hear it, too.
