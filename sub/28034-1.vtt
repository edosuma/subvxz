05:31.635 --> 05:34.334
POWER INVESTED--
POWER VESTED.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.292

06:08.063 --> 06:10.979
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
- WHAT?

06:11.022 --> 06:14.765
ARE THOSE THE MAGICAL MISTS OF
THE FALLS OR HAS MY VISION BECOME

06:14.809 --> 06:18.160
A PERMANENT FRENCH
IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING?

06:22.991 --> 06:25.385
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING
NIAGARA FALLS FOR OUR WEDDING.

06:28.953 --> 06:32.435

07:02.160 --> 07:04.467
AND EXPRESSED TODAY, I--

07:04.511 --> 07:06.600

UH, WHITE RICE OR BROWN RICE?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.520
WHITE RICE. THE BROWN RICE IS
FOR THE DINNER THEY REQUESTED.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.436
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE.

07:22.137 --> 07:26.010
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
UM, WHY ARE WE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE FALLS?

07:26.054 --> 07:27.272
EXCUSE ME, DRIVER.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.536
SIR, ARE WE GOING
THE WRONG WAY?

07:29.579 --> 07:31.538
TELL YOU MORE THERE.
WE ARE CLOSE.

07:31.581 --> 07:34.149
WE ARE STAYING
IN NIAGARA FALLS?

07:34.192 --> 07:36.586
YEAH, NIAGARA FALLS.
ALMOST THERE.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.545
NO WORRY.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.503
DARREN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:40.547 --> 07:42.113
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.509
YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO

07:46.553 --> 07:49.860
WHEN NONE OF THIS
COULD'VE BEEN POSSIBLE,

07:49.904 --> 07:52.472
ESPECIALLY IN MY GRANDFATHER'S
ERA WHEN HE BUILT THIS PLACE.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.212
BUT HERE WE ARE.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.867
SO, WITH THE POWER
INVESTED IN ME

07:56.911 --> 07:58.695
FROM THE GREAT STATE
OF NEW YORK,

07:58.739 --> 08:01.872
I HEREBY PRONOUNCE YOU...

08:01.916 --> 08:04.571
OH, BOY. UH...

08:04.614 --> 08:07.399
MAN AND, UH, W--

08:07.443 --> 08:10.968
YOU KNOW, WE PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFOREHAND.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
WE GOT A NEW FORM
WE'RE WORKING OUT,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.015
A LITTLE CHECKLIST THING,

08:14.058 --> 08:16.104
BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GO FIRST,
AND YOU GUYS...

08:16.147 --> 08:20.108
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY,
LIKE, HUSBAND AND WIFE IF--

08:20.151 --> 08:22.937
THE MARRIED COUPLE!

08:34.948 --> 08:36.645
- CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR BAG PLEASE?
- NO, NO.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.735
OH, OKAY.

08:41.477 --> 08:44.306
WHAT THE HELL?

08:44.349 --> 08:47.135
DARREN! NAH,
THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE.

08:47.178 --> 08:50.442
DARREN, TELL ME
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.053
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

08:54.142 --> 08:57.014
TWO MEN. TWO MEN.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
HEY, LOOK, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.933
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IN ITS OWN WAY, IT'S--

09:02.977 --> 09:06.720
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT A CHEMICAL PLANT?

09:06.763 --> 09:09.157
WHAT IS SPEWING OUT OF
THOSE SMOKESTACKS? DARREN!

09:09.200 --> 09:11.551
- I...
- DARREN!

09:16.599 --> 09:19.689
WELCOME TO
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.083
I'M SHIBBAWITZ.
CAN I TAKE YOU TO YOUR ROOM?

09:22.126 --> 09:24.215
COME ON.
THIS WAY PLEASE.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.917
IT'S SHIBBAWITZ.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.224
TWO MEN!

09:34.225 --> 09:35.575
TWO MEN!

09:37.489 --> 09:40.405
SO YOU GUYS ARE NEXT. OH!

09:40.449 --> 09:43.017
AREN'T THEY A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE?
LOOK AT THAT.

09:43.060 --> 09:48.718
LET ME ASK YOU,
ARE THOSE MUTTONCHOPS?

09:51.112 --> 09:55.116
WELL, ALL THE WAY
FROM PHOENIX. INCREDIBLE.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.031
I GOT YOU
IN THE ROCK HUDSON ROOM.

09:57.074 --> 10:00.425
IT'S GOT IT'S OWN
HEART-SHAPED VALENTINE BED.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.737
YEAH, AND DON'T FORGET
TO VISIT OUR SUNDRIES SHOP.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.174
WE'VE GOT FACE CREAMS
AND CONDITIONERS

10:10.218 --> 10:13.264
AND TUBS AND TUBS
OF VASELINE.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.397
OKAY, SO I WANT YOU
TO ENJOY YOUR STAY,

10:15.440 --> 10:17.094
TIM'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU,

10:17.138 --> 10:19.270
AND HAVE A GREAT TIME.

10:21.969 --> 10:25.842
WHAT IS THIS?
THIS HAS TO BE A MISTAKE.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.671
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BIGGEST DAY OF MY--

10:28.715 --> 10:32.066
OUR LIFE.
WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.807
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

10:36.505 --> 10:38.159
I THINK
I'M BREATHING IN BENZENE.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.249
YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S BENZENE.
IT'S PROBABLY JUST STEAM.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.905
I'M A DETOX FITNESS COUNSELOR,
DARREN. I KNOW MY BODY,

10:44.948 --> 10:47.037
AND I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE A FULL ON BONG HIT

10:47.081 --> 10:49.344
FROM A SMOKESTACK
TO KNOW WHAT'S KILLING ME.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.172
LISTEN,
I'M TALKING SMOKESTACKS--

10:51.215 --> 10:53.870
I'M TALKING SMOKESTACKS
ON OUR WEDDING.

11:00.442 --> 11:04.098
HI. THAT'S YOUR ROOM.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.534
YOU LIKE COLOR TV?

11:13.063 --> 11:16.676
WOW. THEY ARE AWARE THAT GAY
PEOPLE SLEEP TOGETHER, RIGHT?

11:16.719 --> 11:19.722
MAYBE IT'S A PART OF THE JANE
SEYMOUR OPEN HEART COLLECTION.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.682
MORE LIKE THE ROCK HUDSON
CLOSETED COLLECTION.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.777
WOW!

11:30.820 --> 11:33.736
ARE YOU REALLY LOOKING
AT THIS?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.390
I HATE TO SAY IT,

11:35.433 --> 11:37.871
BUT THIS IS THE EXACT
"AESTHETIC FROM BRANSON" PUB

11:37.914 --> 11:40.264
THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,
ISN'T IT?

11:40.308 --> 11:43.877
- IT'S COMPLETELY AUTHENTIC.
- WHAT?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.314
THERE'S NOT A PLACE
WITHIN 2,000 MILES OF PHOENIX

11:46.357 --> 11:48.925
- THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
- THANK GOD!

11:48.969 --> 11:51.449
EVERYONE WANTS TO CAPTURE THIS
MID-CENTURY INDUSTRIAL LOOK,

11:51.493 --> 11:53.364
AND WE'RE IN ITS EPICENTER.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.802
YOU'RE NOT DEFENDING
THIS PLACE.

11:55.845 --> 11:59.283
NO, I'M JUST MAKING A COMMENT.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.764
DARREN, DARREN,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.375
THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.116
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.465
RIGHT?

12:07.509 --> 12:09.163
LOOK AT THE WAY
THE PIPES WIND AROUND.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.078
THAT'S NEVER CAPTURED.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.776
THERE'S EVEN BEAUTY
TO ITS STRANGE DESOLATION.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.040
YOU ARE SO FUCKING
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.781
I'M A DESIGNER, DEAN.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.914
YOU'VE GOTTA LET GO OF
ALL THE NEGATIVE CONNECTIONS

12:20.957 --> 12:22.393
THAT EVERYONE'S LAPPED ON IT.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.005
WHAT, LIKE CANCER,
HOPELESSNESS, DEATH?

12:25.048 --> 12:29.313
LIKE BOLDNESS, LIKE PROGRESS,
INNOVATION.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.794
THESE ARE NOT REMNANTS
OF DESPAIR,

12:31.838 --> 12:36.407
BUT RELICS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST
CENTURIES IN HUMAN HISTORY.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.148
- OH, MY GOD!
- WHAT?

12:38.192 --> 12:41.804
MY PEE IS DAY-GLO YELLOW.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.501
LIKE AFTER YOU TAKE
A TON OF VITAMINS,

12:43.545 --> 12:45.460
BUT I HAVEN'T TAKEN
ANY VITAMINS!

12:45.503 --> 12:47.984
IT'S THIS AIR AND THIS WATER

12:48.028 --> 12:50.117
THIS ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!

12:51.727 --> 12:55.818
LOOK. IT'S THERE.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.777
I'M NOT LOOKING.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.650
BELIEVE ME,
SMELLING IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.913
IS THAT THE QUEERPON PRINTOUT?

13:03.957 --> 13:07.090
- NO.
- I'M FIXING THIS.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.360
THIS IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE.

13:16.404 --> 13:19.668
WHERE ARE THE MAGICAL MISTS?
WHERE ARE THE THUNDERING RAPIDS?

13:19.711 --> 13:21.757
I'M SO SORRY.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.889
ANOTHER ROOM?

13:22.932 --> 13:25.369
ANOTHER ROOM--

13:25.413 --> 13:26.849
ANOTHER CHANCE AT LIFE.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.504
WE UPGRADE.
BRAND NEW ROOM.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.158
BETTER VIEW. YES.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.986
BETTER VIEW OF WHAT?

13:33.029 --> 13:34.726
THE TOXIC SLUDGE PIT OUTSIDE?

13:34.770 --> 13:37.729
I DEMAND A FULL REFUND.
WHERE'S NIAGARA FALLS?

13:37.773 --> 13:38.992
AH!

13:39.035 --> 13:41.429
THIS IS NIAGARA FALLS.

13:41.472 --> 13:44.388
IT'S ACTUALLY THE CITY
OF NIAGARA FALLS.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.999
YES, UH, HERE.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.176
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.569
STUNNING NIAGARA FALLS,

13:51.613 --> 13:55.182
ONE OF THE EARLY GREAT
INDUSTRIAL CITIES OF AMERICA.

13:55.225 --> 13:59.839
ALL POWERED BY NIKOLA TESLA'S
IMAGINATION AND DEDICATION

13:59.882 --> 14:03.886
TO HARNESSING THE GREAT,
MIGHTY NIAGARA

14:03.930 --> 14:06.758
TO POWER
THE INDUSTRIAL MONUMENTS

14:06.802 --> 14:09.500
THAT COMPRISE
THE STUNNING VIEWS

14:09.544 --> 14:13.548
OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.158
IT IS GLORIOUS.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.681
WHERE ARE YOU READING THAT?

14:16.725 --> 14:19.989
- RIGHT HERE.
- OH, ON THE SIDE MARGIN.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.732
NO ONE ACCEPTS THAT AS VALID,
FUNCTIONAL ONLINE REAL ESTATE.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.169
MY IPAD CAN'T EVEN READ THAT.

14:26.213 --> 14:30.565
I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE GOING
TO HAVE A WONDERFUL WEDDING.

14:30.608 --> 14:31.871
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

14:31.914 --> 14:35.135
OUT BED APPEARS
TO BE CUT IN HALF.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.702
I'M TALKING TO SAYA RIGHT NOW.
HE'S GONNA FIX IT.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.488
YOU KNOW, LOOK,
HE'S AN OLD MAN.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.925
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND,
AND HE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.145
HOW DOES THAT HELP ANYTHING?

14:45.188 --> 14:48.235
HE SEES TWO MEN.
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND LIKE THE OTHERS.

14:48.278 --> 14:52.674
LIKE THE DRIVER AND HIS '90S
DISCO BALL LASER PRIDE SHOW.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.242
REALLY, YOU DIDN'T--
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT, HUH?

14:55.285 --> 14:58.593
EXCUSE ME,
I HATE TO BOTHER YOU BOTH,

14:58.636 --> 15:00.638
BUT OUR REFRIGERATOR
IN OUR ROOM ISN'T WORKING

15:00.682 --> 15:03.119
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT THIS STAYS COLD.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.208
IT'S MY MEDICINE.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.950
YEAH, NO PROBLEM. WE'LL JUST PUT
THIS IN THE BACK OFFICE FRIDGE,

15:07.994 --> 15:10.910
AND YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

15:10.953 --> 15:14.739
RIGHT, UH-- OH.

15:14.783 --> 15:15.958
INTRODUCE US, PLEASE.

15:16.002 --> 15:19.701
OH, THIS IS, UM...

15:19.744 --> 15:22.095
- DEAN.
- RUSSELL.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.879
WE'RE BOTH SO HAPPY.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.968
THANK YOU.
IT WAS PERFECT.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.189
DON'T FORGET TO GIVE US A
BIG HIGH RANKING ON QUEERPON.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.581
WE'RE HAVING
OUR RECEPTION PARTY TOMORROW.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.715
COULD ALWAYS USE
A FEW MORE BODIES.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.064
SHOULD WE PAY THE BALANCE NOW?

15:35.108 --> 15:36.500
NO PROBLEM. YEAH.

15:36.544 --> 15:40.940
YEAH, WELL,
I'M GONNA COME BACK LATER.

15:40.983 --> 15:45.335
YOU KNOW, I COULD ALWAYS UPGRADE YOU
TO THE FATHER OF THE BRADY BUNCH ROOM.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.772
I AM TELLING YOU,
IT'S SPECTACULAR.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.731
IT'S A GREAT CORNER VIEW.

15:49.774 --> 15:53.213
THIS TIME OF YEAR,
PEOPLE ARE REQUEST IT ALL THE TIME.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.698
HONEY, I'M HOME.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.745
WELL, I FAILED.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.011
OH, GOD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE NOT UNPACKING.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.972
NO. NO, BUT...

16:13.015 --> 16:15.191
I DO HAVE THE DESIGN
FOR THE PUB.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.977
- LOOK.
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT A SHITHOLE.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.891
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE
TO THIS INDUSTRIAL LOOK

16:19.935 --> 16:21.981
THAN EXPOSED AIR DUCTS
AND BRICK.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.591
LOOK AT THESE LARGE JOINTS,

16:23.634 --> 16:25.593
THE DIFFERENT PIPES
THAT JOIN EVERYTHING TOGETHER,

16:25.636 --> 16:26.942
THE VARIOUS METALLIC SHADES.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.901
OH, MY BRAIN IS FIRING OFF.

16:29.945 --> 16:33.644
I'M GLAD THAT YOU GOT
ALL THIS CREATIVE INSPIRATION

16:33.688 --> 16:35.255
FROM THAT GIANT MESS
OUT THERE,

16:35.298 --> 16:38.171
BUT WE ARE NOT STAYING HERE.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.824
MMM.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.740
REALLY? HELLO. HELLO.
JUST--

16:42.784 --> 16:43.828
OH, NO, DON'T--
YOU'RE GONNA RIP IT.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.048
- DARREN-- OKAY.
- OKAY, OKAY.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.705
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IT.
CAN'T YOU SEE IT?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.837
I CARE MORE ABOUT
THE LOOK OF OUR WEDDING,

16:52.881 --> 16:55.405
NOT WHAT A BUNCH OF DRUNKEN
PHOENIX HIPSTERS THINK

16:55.449 --> 16:56.624
AS THEY TRY TO GET
THEIR BODY TEMPERATURE

16:56.667 --> 16:58.060
DOWN TO A COMFORTABLE 107.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.628
ALL RIGHT, WOW. OKAY.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.586
- WOW.
- WHAT?

17:02.630 --> 17:06.199
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT?
- NOTHING. NOTHING.

17:06.242 --> 17:11.290
NO, WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO SAY?

17:11.334 --> 17:16.296
IT'S JUST, YOU'D THINK YOU'D GET SOME
ARTISTIC BENEFITS MARRYING A GAY MAN.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.080
WELL, WE'RE GONNA GO THERE.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.693
HOW DARE YOU QUESTION
A GAY BONE IN MY BODY?

17:22.737 --> 17:23.867
HUH.

17:23.912 --> 17:25.740
YOU BOOKED OUR WEDDING

17:25.782 --> 17:28.047
IN SOME RUNDOWN MOTOR LODGE

17:28.089 --> 17:32.747
IN A FORGOTTEN
BLUE COLLAR FREAK SHOW.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.531
AND YOU ARE GOING TO
UNBOOK IT...

17:34.575 --> 17:35.924
NOW.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.886
- FINE.
- THANK YOU.

18:40.684 --> 18:41.685
DEAN.

18:46.473 --> 18:49.215
HERE, THE CRAZY CLOWN COMB
IS ONLY 12 MORE TICKETS.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.657
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.137
HERE, I BROUGHT YOU
A SCREWDRIVER.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.964
HERE. HERE YOU GO.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.054
REALLY? WHAT? WHAT?
THEY SNAP TOGETHER? WHAT?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.622
TWO WORDS. JACK, HAMMER.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.798
JACKHAMMER.
YOU WANT A JACKHAMMER.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.366
SOUNDS LIKE... ALL RIGHT,
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.585
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.979
WELL, HURRY IT UP.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.851
A TEA PARTY CONVENTION,
DARREN,

19:16.894 --> 19:18.983
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.508
I CAN'T BELIEVE I TRUSTED YOU-- I
TRUSTED YOU WITH BOOKING OUR WEDDING.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.292
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

19:23.336 --> 19:25.990
MAYBE IF YOU WOULD LET ME WATCH
FOX NEWS ONCE IN A BLUE MOON,

19:26.034 --> 19:27.949
I'D BE UP ON THESE
SORT OF THINGS.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.777
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I DON'T MEAN
WATCHING HANNITY ALL NIGHT LONG,

19:29.820 --> 19:31.170
BUT CAVUTO'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.215
OKAY, FINE.
YOU KNOW, I HATE FOX NEWS.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.870
BUT I LIKE
ANDERSON COOPER...

19:39.830 --> 19:42.877
HOW DID YOU GET SNOOKERED
INTO THIS?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.444
I DON'T KNOW.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.533
MAYBE I SAW THE CRAZY
LOW PACKAGE PRICE,

19:46.576 --> 19:47.795
AND I GOT ALL EXCITED.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.405
YOU WERE SHOPPING
FOR OUR WEDDING

19:49.449 --> 19:52.060
LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO BUY
A CHARGER CORD ON EBAY.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.105
NO, I WAS WATCHING SOMETHING,

19:54.149 --> 19:55.846
AND SUDDENLY SOMETHING
CAUGHT MY EYE,

19:55.890 --> 19:57.065
AND I JUST STARTED
CLICKING ON IT.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.980
YOU KNOW, DEAN,
SHIT HAPPENS.

19:59.023 --> 20:02.244
NO, SHIT DOESN'T HAPPEN,
DARREN.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.986
NOT ON YOUR WEDDING.
IT JUST DOESN'T.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.337
DEAN.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.384
EXCUSE ME.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.429
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO SELL
ANY BARRELS, WOULD YOU?

20:13.473 --> 20:16.606
YOU KNOW, FOR A MAN,
OH, I DON'T KNOW, ABOUT MY SIZE?

20:16.650 --> 20:19.392
NO? YOU SHOULD REALLY
CONSIDER IT.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.226
WHAT'S WITH THE COT?

20:27.269 --> 20:31.621
DOES HE KNOW?
DID YOU TELL HIM THAT--

20:31.665 --> 20:35.712
THAT THERE'S GAY MEN
SLEEPING TOGETHER HERE?

20:35.756 --> 20:39.238
DOES HE KNOW?
DID YOU TELL HIM?

20:39.281 --> 20:42.676
DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT...

20:42.719 --> 20:45.026
NO, NO.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.725
THEN WHY DOES HE THINK HE'S
PUTTING THE BED BACK TOGETHER?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.684
SHE CAN'T TELL HIM.

20:50.727 --> 20:55.602
WHAT? KHIN, KHIN,
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

20:55.645 --> 20:58.648
THE WOMAN FROM THE AGENCY'S
COMING TOMORROW. THE AGENCY?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.607
SHE'S GONNA APPROVE
OUR EXTENSION.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.870
WE CAN'T LOSE GUESTS.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.314
WHAT?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.098
PROBLEM.
WE CAN'T TELL HIM.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.275
OH, GOD. I--

21:34.945 --> 21:36.033
HMM.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.002
GREAT.

21:59.666 --> 22:03.583
OH... MY... GOD.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.108
IT'S AMAZING.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.157
IT'S MAGNIFICENT.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.990
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:20.034 --> 22:24.212
WE CAN MAKE IT WORK, HUH?
IN AN IRONIC WAY, RIGHT?

22:24.255 --> 22:27.128
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.522
JUST GO WITH IT

22:29.565 --> 22:32.525
AND FIND A SHUTTLE
TO TAKE US HERE.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.657
YEAH, WE COULD DO THIS.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.746
WE'RE GAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.531
DIDN'T WE INVENT
CULTURAL IRONY?

22:38.574 --> 22:40.141
EXACTLY.

22:40.184 --> 22:43.187
I MEAN, IF ANDY WARHOL CAN MAKE
AN ORDINARY OLD SOUP CAN

22:43.231 --> 22:45.755
- INTO AN INTERNATIONAL SENSATION...
- YES.

22:45.799 --> 22:49.193
IF ANDY COHEN CAN TAKE
DESPICABLE, SPOILED HOUSEWIVES

22:49.237 --> 22:52.545
AND TURN IT INTO DELICIOUS
ENTERTAINMENT...

22:52.588 --> 22:55.374
WOW, I NEVER REALIZED HOW GAY
THE NAME ANDY WAS.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.856
I GET IT.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.686
WE'RE JUST A COUPLE QUEERS
GETTING MARRIED.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.733
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
- IT'S GREAT.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.566
APPARENTLY...

23:13.609 --> 23:14.958
NOT GAY ENOUGH.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.396
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:17.439 --> 23:18.614
NOTHING.

23:18.658 --> 23:19.746
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE--

23:19.789 --> 23:21.225
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.053
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.534
YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND
TO SEE IF IT'S OKAY.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.057
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW
THAT LOOK?

23:27.101 --> 23:29.538
IT'S THE ONLY LOOK I KNOW.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.192
THERE'S ABOUT
A THOUSAND VERSIONS OF IT.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.455
OH, BARREL, BARREL.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.935
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A BARREL?

23:34.978 --> 23:37.459
OH, MAYBE I CAN GO DOWN
TO THE CAN JAM.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.114
JOKE ALL YOU WANT,
BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.769
I WAS JUST BEING MINDFUL.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.335
MINDFUL OF WHAT?

23:44.379 --> 23:46.555
IF THE WORLD WILL ACCEPT US?

23:46.599 --> 23:49.515
THERE'S A CONVENTION GOING ON.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.439
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
NOT MAN ENOUGH...

24:00.482 --> 24:02.049
TO BE AN ANDY.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.972
HOW ABOUT AN ANDY DICK?

24:28.858 --> 24:32.079
HELLO.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

24:32.122 --> 24:35.082
OH, IT'S PROBABLY NOT BEST
TO BE AN ANDY RIGHT NOW.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.518
MORE LIKE A BUCK OR A RAMBO.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.085
PLEASE, THOSE NAMES
ARE GAYER THAN ANDY.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.653
- HA, HA!
- HI.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.437
UH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

24:42.481 --> 24:45.135
WHAT LIES BEFORE YOU

24:45.179 --> 24:48.878
IS NOT AN EXAMPLE
OF THE DECLINE

24:48.922 --> 24:50.924
OF YOUR BELOVED AMERICA.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.536
BUT I RESPECTIVELY OFFER

24:54.580 --> 24:58.322
THAT WHAT LIES BEFORE YOU
IS THE ULTIMATE

24:58.366 --> 25:03.110
EXAMPLE OF AMERICAN PROGRESS
AND LIBERTY.

25:03.153 --> 25:08.332
CAN THERE BE ANYTHING
MORE DEMONSTRATIVE

25:08.376 --> 25:12.336
OF AMERICAN FREEDOM
THAN TWO MEN

25:12.380 --> 25:15.688
OPENLY EXPRESSING THEIR LOVE
FOR ONE ANOTHER

25:15.731 --> 25:18.517
WITHOUT THE FEAR
OF GETTING KILLED?

25:18.560 --> 25:19.953
OR MAIMED.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.565
OKAY, ON THE COUNT OF THREE...

25:32.182 --> 25:33.575
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU!

25:33.619 --> 25:36.099
- WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!
- HUH.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.362
AND WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED ON SUNDAY!

25:41.191 --> 25:43.585
AND YOU'RE ALL INVITED.
SHIT.

25:45.021 --> 25:47.850
AND, UH, THREE. RUN.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.959
YES.

26:10.003 --> 26:13.746
OKAY, CAN YOU TAKE
A PEEK UP THERE,

26:13.789 --> 26:15.486
JUST FOR ME?
I'LL LIFT YOU UP?

26:15.530 --> 26:18.141
- JUST A QUICK PEEK.
- IS THAT OKAY?

26:18.185 --> 26:20.317
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.
DON'T EVER DO THIS.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.667
BUT WE HAVE A WEDDING
TO PUT ON RIGHT?

26:21.710 --> 26:22.972
AND I GOTTA KNOW
IF THEY CAME BACK,

26:23.016 --> 26:24.191
SO COME ON.
I'LL LIFT YOU.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.759
PUT THIS AWAY.

26:26.802 --> 26:28.195
HERE. HERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.413
ALL RIGHT, READY?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.767
UNH! WHAT DO YOU SEE?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.464
I SEE TWO MEN.

26:36.507 --> 26:37.987
REALLY? OKAY,
I'M LETTING YOU DOWN.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.336
THEY'RE NAKED ON THE BED.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.773
REALLY? WELL,
I'M LETTING YOU DOWN.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.426
WAIT, WAIT. ONE SECOND.
THEY'RE SPOONING.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.604
GET DOWN.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.956
GO, GO, GO. JUST GO.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.396
GOOD MORNING, DARREN.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.224
DEAN-- DARREN.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.008
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT HERE?

26:59.052 --> 27:00.662
- I WAS GONNA SLIP THIS UNDER YOUR DOOR.
- OH.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.447
THIS IS THE PLAYLIST
FOR THE WEDDING RECEPTION.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.624
YEAH, THERE WE MAKE SOME
SUGGESTIONS OF SONGS,

27:05.667 --> 27:07.800
YOU KNOW,
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,

27:07.843 --> 27:12.631
BOBBY GOLDSBORO,
"LAST DANCE." HIS COVER.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.024
YOU CAN'T--
I'M TELLING YOU,

27:15.068 --> 27:17.331
WHEN YOU HEAR IT,
THERE'S A QUALITY.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.986
AND THEN THERE'S STUFF
FOR CONTEMPORARY STUFF,

27:20.029 --> 27:21.814
RIGHT? YOU KNOW?
LIKE "BEYONCE" RIGHT THERE.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.512
OKAY. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.296
MY PEE IS STILL
GLOW IN THE DARK.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.994
AND I'M TRUSTING YOU, DARREN.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.998
DEAN? DEAN, COME HERE.
IT'S SHIBBAWITZ.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.217
OH, HELLO.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:34.261 --> 27:38.569
WELL, I JUST DECIDED
THAT I AM GOING TO THROW IN

27:38.613 --> 27:40.615
AN UPGRADE FOR YOU BOTH--

27:40.659 --> 27:45.315
THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS
TO THE RAINBOW BRIDGE JACUZZI.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.057
GIVE YOU GUYS A CHANCE

27:48.101 --> 27:51.452
TO KIND OF BE
FLAM... BOUYANT.

27:56.239 --> 27:57.371
DO YOU WANT SOME?

27:57.414 --> 27:59.503
NO, NO.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.853
GREAT. MORE FOR ME.

28:06.859 --> 28:10.514
SO, YOU SIGN THIS HERE
AND HERE,

28:10.558 --> 28:13.953
AND THAT ALLOWS ME
TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY.

28:13.996 --> 28:18.174
I SEE THAT YOU BOTH CHECKED
NONDENOMINATIONAL CEREMONY,

28:18.218 --> 28:22.309
SO I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO PUT ON
MY NONDENOMINATIONAL CAP.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.876
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS THINKING,

28:23.919 --> 28:25.878
MAYBE WE COULD JUST HAVE, LIKE,
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.881
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT THE
WHOLE THING TO BE DEVOID OF GOD.

28:28.924 --> 28:32.014
SURE, I CAN THROW IN GOD
REFERENCES ALL DAY, IF YOU LIKE.

28:32.058 --> 28:36.236
GREAT. GREAT. VERY WELL.

28:36.279 --> 28:42.242
I GOT THE PAPERS,
YOUR MARRIAGE PAPERS BACK FROM THE STATE,

28:42.285 --> 28:47.726
AND APPARENTLY THERE'S
A GLITCH OF SORTS.

28:47.769 --> 28:51.164
I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAD A CHANCE
TO DISCUSS THIS BY NOW.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.774
DISCUSS WHAT?

28:52.818 --> 28:55.690
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW. WHAT?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.779
- I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
- NO.

28:57.823 --> 29:01.043
REALLY?
YOU HAVEN'T GONE OVER THIS?

29:01.087 --> 29:03.263
WHAT IS IT?

29:03.306 --> 29:07.746
DARREN, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING?

29:07.789 --> 29:09.095
I DON'T KNOW.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.184
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.969
REALLY? OKAY. WELL--

29:14.013 --> 29:19.235
OH. OH, SHIT.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.412
WHAT? IS SOMEBODY
GOING TO CLUE ME IN?

29:22.456 --> 29:25.024
WHAT, ARE YOU A RUSSIAN
SLEEPER AGENT? A PISCES?

29:25.067 --> 29:27.809
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE
A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER?

29:27.853 --> 29:30.812
NO, BUT I MIGHT AS WELL BE.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.379
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

29:32.422 --> 29:35.774
WELL, HOW SHOULD WE PUT THIS?

29:35.817 --> 29:37.601
DARREN IS MARRIED.

29:37.645 --> 29:40.604
WHA--

29:40.648 --> 29:44.434
YOU'RE MAR-- WHAT?

29:44.478 --> 29:46.088
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN,
YOU SON OF A BITCH?

29:46.132 --> 29:47.394
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.789
THIS DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
A BIG DEAL.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.226
OKAY, LISTEN,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.836
IT WAS TO A WOMAN.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.708
ACTUALLY, YEAH.
A MAGGIE SMITH.

29:57.752 --> 30:00.537
OH, AND THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

30:00.581 --> 30:03.062
- NO--
- IT'S SHOWING UP THAT THE DIVORCE

30:03.105 --> 30:04.977
HASN'T BEEN
OFFICIALLY TERMINATED,

30:05.020 --> 30:06.282
SO MAGGIE JUST HAS TO COME

30:06.326 --> 30:09.503
AND SIGN
A LITTLE DOCUMENT HERE,

30:09.546 --> 30:12.027
AND EVERYTHING CAN GO BACK
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.812
OKAY, SEE? SEE? LOOK.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.465
LOOK, I'M SORRY, DEAN.

30:15.509 --> 30:18.729
I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD'VE
SIGNED THE DAMN THINGS

30:18.773 --> 30:21.820
AND SENT THEM IN.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT.

30:21.863 --> 30:25.040
YOU FORGOT ABOUT IT?
YOU FORGOT THAT YOU WERE STILL MARRIED?

30:25.084 --> 30:27.434
NO, I DIDN'T FORGET
ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

30:27.477 --> 30:30.437
- JUST GIVE US A SECOND.
- OKAY, SURE.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.004
LOOK,
AFTER THE MARRIAGE FAILED,

30:32.047 --> 30:35.485
I JUST WENT ON WITH MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW, AS A GAY MAN.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.705
AND I CAME TO ACCEPT
THE HARSH REALITY

30:37.748 --> 30:41.056
THAT I WOULD PROBABLY
NEVER GET MARRIED AGAIN.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.016
GUYS, IF YOU CAN REMEMBER,
IT WAS JUST A SHORT TIME AGO

30:44.059 --> 30:47.149
THAT IT WAS UNIMAGINABLE
FOR TWO MEN TO GET MARRIED.

30:47.193 --> 30:48.629
OH, DON'T USE THAT CARD.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.023
I AM USING THAT CARD
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

30:51.066 --> 30:55.549
- AND, LOOK, I JUST--
- WHO-- WHAT ARE YOU?

30:55.592 --> 30:59.205
I'M THE SAME GUY I WAS
FIVE MINUTES AGO, DEAN.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.684
AND WHAT IS THAT?

31:00.728 --> 31:02.904
BI, CLOSETED STRAIGHT,
A LIAR.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.254
OKAY, STOP IT. STOP IT.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

31:05.298 --> 31:09.258
YEAH, OKAY,
WELL, WHAT DARREN IS SAYING

31:09.302 --> 31:13.001
IS THAT HE'S
A COMMITTED GAY MAN AND, UH--

31:13.045 --> 31:15.264
WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

31:15.308 --> 31:18.050
IT ONLY LASTED TWO YEARS.
WE WERE YOUNG.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.573
I MEAN, SHE WAS NICE,

31:19.616 --> 31:21.705
BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY
MEANINGLESS AND WRONG.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.491
NO, THE WEDDING.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.275
I ASSUME YOU HAD A WEDDING.

31:26.319 --> 31:29.888
YEAH, IT WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE,

31:29.931 --> 31:31.715
PERFUNCTORY
RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM,

31:31.759 --> 31:33.239
TON OF FOOD,

31:33.282 --> 31:35.110
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A--
A REAL WEDDING.

31:35.154 --> 31:38.070
A REAL WEDDING.

31:38.113 --> 31:42.509
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
A "REAL" WEDDING?

31:42.552 --> 31:44.250
WHAT IS THIS?

31:49.516 --> 31:50.778
OH, LOOK!

31:50.821 --> 31:53.302
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ARRIVED.

31:53.346 --> 31:56.740
HEY, GUYS.
GUYS, COME ON.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.613
THIS IS GONNA BE
A GREAT WEDDING.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.528
DEAN, I WILL CALL MAGGIE.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.530
I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT SHE SIGNS THE PAPERS.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.967
IT'LL BE GREAT.
IT'LL BE LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.796
A REAL WEDDING, HUH?

32:08.839 --> 32:11.799
JUST WOW.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.980
HOW AM I GONNA MAKE THIS CALL?

32:19.024 --> 32:23.550
I LEFT HER.
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I'M GAY.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.378
HOW AM I GONNA DO THIS?

32:28.163 --> 32:29.773
LOVE FINDS A WAY.

32:33.603 --> 32:36.345
A WOMAN! YEAH!

32:36.389 --> 32:40.219
- IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT...
- VERY BAD.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.569
HEY, WAIT, YOU GUYS
ARE NOT DOWN ON DARREN, ARE YOU?

32:42.612 --> 32:46.312
FOR WHAT? FOR REACHING INTO THOSE
CHERRY TOMATOES AT THE SALAD BAR?

32:46.355 --> 32:47.617
I MEAN, THE GUY'S BEEN THERE.

32:47.661 --> 32:49.358
HE'S DONE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.970
YOU DON'T WANT HIM THINKING
AND DOING AND QUESTIONING

32:52.013 --> 32:53.972
AND GAY MIND-FUCKING
YOUR MARRIAGE.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.799
YOU WANT THAT IN YOUR PAST

32:55.843 --> 32:58.628
BECAUSE YOU
ARE HIS FUTURE NOW.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.282
NAMASTE.

33:00.326 --> 33:03.851
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S DONE EXPERIMENTING?

33:03.894 --> 33:05.461
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.768
I JUST HAVE
A BIGGER SALAD BAR.

33:07.811 --> 33:10.031
MORE LIKE A VEGAS BUFFET.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.380
JUST AS LONG
AS THEY KEEP ON BRINGING OUT

33:11.424 --> 33:13.861
THOSE BREAKFAST SAUSAGES...

33:15.863 --> 33:18.387
HEY, YOU GUYS
WANNA JOIN THE PARTY?

33:18.431 --> 33:19.823
YOU'RE ALL WELCOME.

33:19.867 --> 33:23.436
GO AHEAD INSIDE NOW.
PARTY!

33:23.479 --> 33:25.264
SOUNDS GOOD, MY BROTHER.

33:25.307 --> 33:27.309
MORE LIKE HALF-BROTHER.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.833
BUT STILL PART
OF THAT GLORIOUS RAINBOW.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.184
COME ON, PEOPLE, NOW!

33:32.227 --> 33:34.751
YEAH,
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

33:34.795 --> 33:38.016
WOW. I'M NOT SURE
MY HEALTH INSURANCE

33:38.059 --> 33:39.800
- COVERS ME FOR THIS WEDDING.
- OKAY.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.416
HELLO, MAGGIE?

33:47.460 --> 33:50.419
HI, IT'S DARREN.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.204
DARREN.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.902
UH, DARREN
YOUR FORMER HUSBAND DARREN.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.862
YEAH.

33:58.906 --> 34:01.387
WELL, I-- I'M DOING.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.607
I'M DOING.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

34:04.651 --> 34:06.305
HELLO?

34:06.348 --> 34:08.263
I GOT SOME INTERFERENCE.
HOLD ON.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.659
IS THAT BETTER?

34:12.702 --> 34:14.878
GREAT, GREAT.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.054
OH, HI, MAGGIE--

34:18.491 --> 34:19.666
OH, GOD!

34:19.708 --> 34:21.059
NO, NO, NO, DON'T HANG UP.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.887
WHAT?

34:23.931 --> 34:25.889
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

34:25.933 --> 34:27.674
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EASY JOB.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.804
YOU SAID NO PROBLEM.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.938
THIS IS
THE ROCK HUDSON UPGRADE.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.245
HE JUST WANTED TO
TAKE IT APART

34:33.288 --> 34:34.898
TO FIND THE CLOG
IN THE PIPE.

34:34.942 --> 34:37.161
HE WANTS TO KNOW
THE LAST TIME IT WAS WORKING.

34:37.205 --> 34:39.120
I DON'T KNOW.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.818
IT JUST, LIKE, FROZE UP
DURING IN THE BLIZZARD OF '77,

34:41.862 --> 34:45.257
AND I DON'T THINK
IT EVER MELTED INSIDE.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.695
DON'T TELL HIM THAT!

34:48.737 --> 34:51.915
EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT'S
ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED.

34:51.958 --> 34:54.831
WHAT IS HE-- IS HE--

34:54.875 --> 34:56.529
AT LEAST I GOT
THE YEAR RIGHT.

34:56.572 --> 34:59.097
TO THE GAY MARRIED LIFE!

35:03.753 --> 35:06.930
RUSSELL, MAYA...

35:06.974 --> 35:09.759
LET'S ALL GROW OLD TOGETHER.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.936
- YEAH.
- YES. LET'S!

35:12.980 --> 35:15.504
DOES THIS EVEN COUNT
AS A GAY WEDDING?

35:15.548 --> 35:19.117
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, AREN'T THEY
A HETEROSEXUAL COUPLE?

35:19.160 --> 35:20.727
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

35:20.770 --> 35:23.121
I'M JUST SAYING, TECHNICALLY
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT

35:23.164 --> 35:24.513
FOR THE SUPREME COURT RULING,

35:24.557 --> 35:27.734
ONLY UNTIL RUSSELL'S
HORMONES KICKED IN.

35:27.777 --> 35:30.258
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE
THE "T" OUT OF LGBT, HUH?

35:30.302 --> 35:34.044
- THANK YOU.
- OOH, NOW, THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY NICE.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.177
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

35:36.221 --> 35:38.179
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS, TALK TO DARREN,

35:38.223 --> 35:40.747
FIND OUT
IF OUR WEDDING IS REAL.

35:40.790 --> 35:44.707
IF YOU ASK ME,
HE PLAYS IT A LITTLE TOO STRAIGHT

35:44.751 --> 35:46.318
TO BE ON OUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.233
I MEAN, NOT THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

35:48.276 --> 35:49.756
I MEAN, I KIND OF LIKE THEM
LIKE THAT, TOO,

35:49.799 --> 35:53.977
BUT TO MARRY?

35:54.021 --> 35:56.023
YOU BE CAREFUL.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.329
OOH, OOH! OOH, OOH!

35:57.372 --> 36:00.114
OOH, OOH! OOH, OOH!

36:03.335 --> 36:05.119
SO, I'VE DECIDED--

36:05.163 --> 36:06.990
I HAVE TO GET IN THE SHOWER.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.341
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT WE HAVE A REAL WEDDING.

36:09.384 --> 36:12.953
- DEAN, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

36:12.996 --> 36:14.650
I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.043
- NO--
- RIGHT NOW.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.219
NO, YOU NEED TO HEAR ME.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.699
I CAN'T.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.790
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

36:23.833 --> 36:27.794
- WHAT-- IS THAT YOU?
- YES, IT'S ME. OKAY?

36:27.837 --> 36:30.362
AMAZINGLY, ONE OF YOUR TOXIC
PARANOID FANTASIES

36:30.405 --> 36:34.017
HAS ACTUALLY MATERIALIZED...

36:34.061 --> 36:35.367
ALL OVER ME,

36:35.410 --> 36:36.803
AND I HAVE TO GET
IN THE SHOWER.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.413
RIGHT NOW.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.809
BUT THE GOOD NEWS
IS THAT MAGGIE'S AGREED

36:42.852 --> 36:44.376
TO SIGN THE PAPERS
AND DRIVE UP.

36:44.419 --> 36:47.030
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.990
SHE JUST NEVER REMARRIED,
SO SHE NEVER SENT THEM IN.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.820
- SHE'LL SIGN EVERYTHING.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS?

36:53.863 --> 36:56.823
MY CHARM. BEING NICE.

36:56.866 --> 36:59.173
NO, THE HORRIBLE LIQUID
ON YOU. WHAT IS IT?

36:59.217 --> 37:02.611
SOME SORT OF SLUDGE.
IT SEEMS TO BE COMING OFF.

37:02.655 --> 37:05.048
I TOLD YOU THIS PLACE
IS KILLING US!

37:05.092 --> 37:07.181
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
OUT OF THE JACUZZI?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.748
UP FROM THE CRACKS
IN THE SIDEWALK?

37:08.791 --> 37:12.055
OH, NO, NOT THE BED.

37:12.099 --> 37:13.840
THERE'S BEEN A SPILL
AT THE CHEMICAL PLANT!

37:13.883 --> 37:16.190
WE'VE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE NOW!

37:16.234 --> 37:18.410
STOP IT!
IT'S ALMOST ALL OFF.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.413
I WAS TRYING TO GET RECEPTION AND
PRIVACY AND AWAY FROM THE MUSIC,

37:21.456 --> 37:23.066
AND SOMEHOW
I WALKED OUT THERE.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.634
RELAX, I WAS, LIKE,
A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE MOTEL.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.419
BELIEVE ME,
NO ONE'S VENTURING OUT THERE.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.861
LIBERATE YOURSELF!
NO FEAR!

37:37.820 --> 37:40.475
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.

37:44.479 --> 37:47.221
MY GOD.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.615
TAKE THIS.

37:53.314 --> 37:56.012
I BELIEVE THERE'S
A MISTAKE HERE.

37:56.056 --> 37:59.102
IS THERE ANOTHER
RAINBOW BRIDGE HOTEL

37:59.146 --> 38:00.278
OR RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

38:00.321 --> 38:01.975
OUR GPS BROUGHT US HERE.

38:02.018 --> 38:04.760
I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
AN ACTUAL RAINBOW BRIDGE,

38:04.804 --> 38:08.286
BUT THIS CANNOT
POSSIBLY BE IT.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.289
WELCOME TO THE ONE AND ONLY
RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

38:11.332 --> 38:16.294
AND YOU TWO MUST BE DEAN--

38:16.337 --> 38:19.906
DARREN'S PARENTS.
AM I RIGHT?

38:19.949 --> 38:24.214
- DARREN'S? ARE--
- THIS IS IT?

38:26.956 --> 38:28.697
JUST ONE SECOND.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.308
THEY'RE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE
THE NEW RECRUITS FOR NEXT YEAR.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.311
TAKE THAT THING OFF NOW!

38:33.354 --> 38:35.225
- THIS IS YOUR SON'S WEDDING!
- IN A SECOND!

38:35.269 --> 38:37.097
THEY'RE GONNA NAME
THE NEW QUARTERBACK.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.751
DON'T YOU CARE?
IT'S THE QUARTERBACK.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.013
THIS COULD DETERMINE
THE FATE OF THE BUCKEYES

38:40.056 --> 38:41.536
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS!

38:41.580 --> 38:44.931
- YOU ARE SICK.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:44.974 --> 38:46.933
IT'S A MIRACLE THAT I'M EVEN
PICKING UP COLUMBUS

38:46.976 --> 38:48.891
RIGHT ON THE BORDER
OF CANADA.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.763
HE SAYS THIS IS THE PLACE.

38:50.806 --> 38:54.332
OKAY, FINE.
WHERE'S OUR ROOM?

38:54.375 --> 38:56.769
HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN
WHERE YOU ARE?

38:56.812 --> 38:59.075
YEAH, IT'S A DUMP.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.817
AT LEAST
IT'S NOT COSTING US ANYTHING.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.341
GIVE ME BACK THE HAT NOW!

39:03.384 --> 39:05.952
HEY, THEY GOT MAZURSKY.
THEY GOT MAZURSKY!

39:05.995 --> 39:09.172
REALLY? I MISSED IT?
I MISSED IT?

39:09.216 --> 39:11.392
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED IT.

39:14.787 --> 39:15.744
TRUTHFULLY, I DON'T KNOW

39:15.788 --> 39:16.832
WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

39:16.876 --> 39:19.008
YOUR GRAND OMISSION?

39:21.141 --> 39:22.969
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO STOMACH.

39:24.274 --> 39:27.365
UGH, FINE.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.805
I'M SORRY.
BUT NOW YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.546
AND ALL THAT
OTHER STUFF'S JUST--

39:34.589 --> 39:35.808
IT'S IN THE PAST.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.553
I NEED A CROSS.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.772
I NEED A REAL PRIEST
AND A REAL CHURCH,

39:43.816 --> 39:46.775
AND DARE I SAY IT,
A REAL WEDDING.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.474
WHAT? UM, REALLY?

39:49.517 --> 39:52.346
NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU SAID.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.566
I THOUGHT THAT WE AGREED
ON A NONRELIGIOUS CEREMONY.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.002
WELL, THINGS HAVE CHANGED,
HAVEN'T THEY?

39:56.045 --> 39:59.222
AND WHAT DO YOU CARE?

39:59.266 --> 40:00.267
A CROSS?

40:03.096 --> 40:06.229
IT'S WHAT I NEED, DARREN.

40:06.273 --> 40:10.582
WELL, MY MOM,

40:10.625 --> 40:12.453
SHE'S GONNA FLIP OUT.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.542
YOUR MOTHER?

40:14.586 --> 40:19.025
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

40:19.068 --> 40:20.461
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
YOU KNEW EVERYTHING?

40:20.505 --> 40:22.332
OH, GOD.

40:22.376 --> 40:26.206
SO, MY MOM,
SHE THINKS THAT MY FAMILY,

40:26.249 --> 40:27.599
THAT, UH-- THAT ME--

40:27.642 --> 40:31.820
THAT WE ARE JEWISH.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.040
- JEWISH?
- IN HER MIND.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.737
HER FATHER'S MOTHER
WAS BORN JEWISH,

40:35.781 --> 40:37.826
WHICH MAKES HER FATHER
TECHNICALLY JEWISH,

40:37.870 --> 40:39.262
AND IN THE REFORM TRADITION,

40:39.306 --> 40:41.264
SHE CAN BE A JEW
IF THE FATHER'S JEWISH,

40:41.308 --> 40:43.615
WHICH MEANS SHE IS A JEW
'CAUSE SHE WANTS TO BE,

40:43.658 --> 40:46.052
AND THAT'S OKAY
ACCORDING TO THE REFORM WORLD,

40:46.095 --> 40:48.228
WHICH MAKES ME JEWISH
BECAUSE I HAVE A JEWISH MOTHER.

40:48.271 --> 40:50.448
OKAY?

40:50.491 --> 40:51.927
GROW SOME BALLS, DARREN.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.755
THEY'VE DRIVEN
VERY FAR TO GET HERE,

40:53.799 --> 40:55.453
ALL THE WAY
FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO,

40:55.496 --> 40:57.193
AND THEY'RE STAYING HERE.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.630
SO?

40:58.673 --> 41:01.850
MY MOTHER JUST DROVE
IN FROM OTTAWA, ONTARIO.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.852
OH, I SEE.

41:03.896 --> 41:06.072
YOU THINK YOUR FAMILY'S
MAKING A BIGGER SACRIFICE

41:06.115 --> 41:08.857
BECAUSE THEY'RE STAYING
IN THE MOTEL 666,

41:08.901 --> 41:10.642
SO WE SHOULD CATER
TO THEM MORE.

41:10.685 --> 41:13.645
WELL, MY MOTHER IS STAYING
WITH HER WITCH OF AN AUNT JUDY

41:13.688 --> 41:18.084
IN AN APARTMENT ABOVE A BURGER
KING/FRANKENSTEIN FUNHOUSE COMBO

41:18.127 --> 41:19.607
IN NIAGARA FALLS, ONTARIO.

41:19.651 --> 41:20.956
SHE JUST TEXTED ME

41:21.000 --> 41:22.392
AND SAID SHE ENTERED
THE APARTMENT

41:22.436 --> 41:25.308
THROUGH A GIANT WEDGE
OF MELTED CHEESE.

41:25.352 --> 41:26.353
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

41:26.396 --> 41:29.661
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT. OKAY?

41:29.704 --> 41:32.490
IT TOOK MY MOTHER YEARS TO
ACCEPT ME BEING GAY,

41:32.533 --> 41:36.494
AND SHE'S JUST NOW COMING AROUND TO
ACCEPTING ME MARRYING ANOTHER MAN,

41:36.537 --> 41:39.322
AND SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO HANDLE A GAY WEDDING

41:39.366 --> 41:41.107
AND AN INTERFAITH WEDDING.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.893
BUT I'M NOT JEWISH.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.504
WE'RE ALREADY HAVING
AN INTERFAITH WEDDING.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.115
I KNOW, BUT NOT CALLING
ATTENTION TO IT

41:49.158 --> 41:51.117
SOMEHOW MAKES
IT MORE PALATABLE.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.686
THIS IS INSANE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

41:54.729 --> 41:57.906
BECAUSE I KNOW!
I GUESS I'M JUST JEWISH ENOUGH

41:57.950 --> 42:00.518
TO KNOW WHAT OFFENDS
A JEWISH MOTHER.

42:00.561 --> 42:03.912
HOW DID YOU AND MAGGIE
WORK AROUND THIS?

42:03.956 --> 42:05.914
WELL,
SHE AGREED TO BE JEWISH,

42:05.958 --> 42:07.568
AND WE GOT MARRIED
IN A TEMPLE WITH A RABBI.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.265
IT WAS VERY LIGHT
ON THE TRADITIONAL STUFF,

42:09.309 --> 42:13.531
AND LIKE I SAID,
IT HAD NO MEANING TO ME AT ALL.

42:13.574 --> 42:16.925
WELL, I'M NOT AGREEING
TO BEING JEWISH,

42:16.969 --> 42:20.146
AND SINCE YOUR FAITH
DOESN'T MEAN THAT MUCH TO YOU,

42:20.189 --> 42:22.931
BUT MINE DOES TO ME,
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

42:22.975 --> 42:28.720
WHY I NEED A CROSS AND A JESUS
AND A PRIEST, ESPECIALLY NOW.

42:28.763 --> 42:32.288
I AM GETTING A CHURCH.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

42:32.332 --> 42:35.161
OH, MY GOD, DEAN.

42:35.204 --> 42:36.771
DEAN.

42:37.772 --> 42:38.773
DEAN.

42:44.692 --> 42:48.696
THE JACUZZI'S STILL NOT FIXED.
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:48.740 --> 42:51.090
WHY ARE YOU JUST--

42:51.133 --> 42:52.395
WHY DOES HE JUST-- JUST--

42:52.439 --> 42:54.572
HE WON'T TALK.

42:57.792 --> 43:00.403
OH, MY GOD.
PUT THAT AWAY! NO!

43:03.537 --> 43:07.585
SHE SAY YOU ARE DEVIL MAN.

43:07.628 --> 43:10.892
DEVIL MAN? SHE'S DRINKING
THE HORMONE THERAPY!

43:10.936 --> 43:13.416
OH, MY GOD,

43:13.460 --> 43:14.853
IT'S THE LADY FROM THE AGENCY.

43:16.811 --> 43:19.988
...WON'T LET HER HAVE
ENERGY DRINK--

43:20.032 --> 43:22.600
ENERGY DRINK? IT'S MEDICINE
FOR ONE OF OUR GUESTS

43:22.643 --> 43:24.427
TO HELP HIM GROW--
HER GROW A BEARD

43:24.471 --> 43:26.212
OR SOME OTHER THING.

43:26.255 --> 43:28.562
GIVE IT TO ME!

43:40.443 --> 43:43.229
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.665
WHY DID I EAT THAT PIZZA?

43:46.145 --> 43:48.277
OKAY.

43:48.321 --> 43:50.845
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.

43:50.889 --> 43:53.282
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.
UP, UP, UP, UP, UP.

43:56.677 --> 44:00.986
HI. CAN I HELP YOU?

44:01.029 --> 44:04.293
YES, DOES THE TIN FAMILY
MAKE THEIR RESIDENCE HERE?

44:04.337 --> 44:06.687
- YES--
- HE DEVIL MAN.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.689
JUST GO BACK.

44:08.733 --> 44:13.651
JUST SOME NASTY SIDE EFFECTS
FROM A DRUG ISSUE.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.523
PLEASE!

44:20.875 --> 44:26.272
SO I'VE DECIDED I WANNA GET
MARRIED IN A CHURCH.

44:26.315 --> 44:31.059
LISTEN TO YOU.
TAKING CHARGE. I LIKE IT.

44:31.103 --> 44:33.671
BUT THAT'S OF COURSE IF A CHURCH
WILL HAVE YOUR QUEER ASS.

44:33.714 --> 44:34.889
SHUT UP, BRADLEY.

44:39.546 --> 44:41.591
LOOK WHO'S COME OUT.

44:41.635 --> 44:44.159
THAT WAS QUICKER THAN A FRESHMAN
IN THE NYU THEATER DEPARTMENT.

44:46.031 --> 44:48.598
COME ON.
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

44:50.122 --> 44:54.343
LET'S DO IT!

45:01.350 --> 45:05.703
IN JANUARY, YOU FILED
WITH MR. TIN FOR AN EXTENSION

45:05.746 --> 45:07.792
FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS
OF HOUSING SUPPORT,

45:07.835 --> 45:10.185
I ASSUME
FOR THE TIN FAMILY.

45:10.229 --> 45:12.318
YOU DON'T APPEAR TO BE

45:12.361 --> 45:14.712
A POLITICAL REFUGEE
FROM MYANMAR.

45:14.755 --> 45:17.540
NO, I'M NOT.
I JUST PROVIDE THEM HOUSING,

45:17.584 --> 45:20.326
- AND THEN WE--
- IT SAYS MR. TIN IS YOUR PARTNER

45:20.369 --> 45:23.198
IN AN ALTERNATIVE
LIFESTYLE MOTEL?

45:23.242 --> 45:25.679
YES, THAT'S RIGHT HERE,

45:25.723 --> 45:30.902
AT THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL!

45:30.945 --> 45:32.033
UH...

45:40.172 --> 45:42.130
WE DON'T GIVE OUT EXTENSIONS.

45:42.174 --> 45:44.567
AS YOU KNOW,
SIX MONTHS IS THE LIMIT.

45:44.611 --> 45:48.746
AND THAT IS WHY TIN AND I
PARTNERED IN THE MOTEL.

45:48.789 --> 45:52.924
SO, IN A SENSE,
THE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION

45:52.967 --> 45:56.144
WHERE HE PAYS ME THE RENT
THAT YOU PROVIDE HIM

45:56.188 --> 45:57.885
IS LIKE HIM BUYING
INTO THE BUSINESS.

45:57.929 --> 45:59.800
RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE STARTUP CAPITAL.

45:59.844 --> 46:03.238
THE FAMILY LIVES HERE,
HELPS OUT AROUND THE MOTEL,

46:03.282 --> 46:06.241
AND A CLASSIC
NIAGARA FALLS LANDMARK

46:06.285 --> 46:09.157
IS SAVED FROM THE
EVER-PRESENT WRECKING BALL.

46:09.201 --> 46:12.595
IT'S A WIN-WIN ALL AROUND.

46:12.639 --> 46:17.165
THESE ARE POLITICAL REFUGEES,
MR. SHIBBAWITZ,

46:17.209 --> 46:20.168
FROM A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.

46:20.212 --> 46:23.911
SOME OF THEM BARELY KNOW
HOW TO FLUSH A TOILET.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.396
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A POLITICAL REFUGEE,

46:30.439 --> 46:32.659
AND HE STARTED THIS PLACE
80 YEARS AGO.

46:32.702 --> 46:34.879
BELIEVE ME,
MY BURMESE FAMILY

46:34.922 --> 46:37.838
HAS THE SAME STREET SMARTS,
DEDICATION,

46:37.882 --> 46:39.884
AND WORK ETHIC THAT HE HAD.

46:39.927 --> 46:42.800
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
THESE PEOPLE.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.976
WE ARE ONTO SOMETHING HERE
AT THE RAINBOW--

46:45.019 --> 46:48.414
- A GAY MARRIAGE DESTINATION. REALLY, MR. SHIBBAWITZ?
- ABSOLUTELY!

46:48.457 --> 46:52.070
WE'VE TAILORED EVERYTHING TO
THIS NEW EMERGING REALITY.

46:52.113 --> 46:54.812
OH, LIKE THAT POSTER?

47:02.428 --> 47:04.734
MORE LIKE THAT.

47:12.307 --> 47:15.745
- HUH. YOU KNOW.
- HMM.

47:19.271 --> 47:21.839
SO THAT WAS QUITE
A PLACE YOU CHOSE.

47:21.882 --> 47:25.973
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THE TOP
RECRUIT ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

47:26.017 --> 47:28.889
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

47:28.933 --> 47:30.848
I DON'T KNOW.

47:30.891 --> 47:32.371
YOU'RE A DESIGNER.

47:32.414 --> 47:34.852
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

47:34.895 --> 47:37.463
THAT'S WHAT YOU COME UP WITH
FOR YOUR WEDDING, DARREN?

47:37.506 --> 47:39.030
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

47:39.073 --> 47:41.815
I DID GET TAKEN IN
A LITTLE BIT BY AN ONLINE AD,

47:41.859 --> 47:43.861
BUT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE LOSS.

47:43.904 --> 47:45.253
THE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY,

47:45.297 --> 47:48.691
AND IT DOES HAVE
ITS OWN UNIQUE AESTHETIC.

47:48.735 --> 47:51.781
AND WHAT'S THAT?
EARLY APOCALYPSE?

47:51.825 --> 47:52.913
MOM, YOU THINK
HE DOESN'T KNOW?

47:52.957 --> 47:55.263
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT HE KNOWS?

47:55.307 --> 47:57.048
I THOUGHT HE WAS STRAIGHT

47:57.091 --> 48:00.051
UNTIL THEY WHEELED ME IN
FOR MY HIP SURGERY.

48:00.094 --> 48:02.618
- THAT'S WHEN YOU TOLD MOM?
- WELL, SHE WAS MUTTERING

48:02.662 --> 48:03.968
THE COMBINATION OF THE SAFE

48:04.011 --> 48:05.491
AND WHAT FONT SHE WANTED
ON HER GRAVESTONE,

48:05.534 --> 48:08.842
SO I JUST THOUGHT,
"BETTER COME CLEAN."

48:08.886 --> 48:13.194
WELL,
IT WAS A VERY SELFISH ACT.

48:13.238 --> 48:15.414
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY ATIVANS
THEY HAD TO GIVE ME

48:15.457 --> 48:17.720
TO KNOCK ME OUT
BEFORE THAT SURGERY

48:17.764 --> 48:20.636
AFTER HEARING THAT?

48:20.680 --> 48:24.945
FINALLY, THEY HAD TO INJECT ME
WITH SODIUM PENTOTHAL

48:24.989 --> 48:27.730
TO PUT ME
IN A MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.863
I WAS VOMITING FOR WEEKS.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.560
SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

48:31.604 --> 48:32.997
SWEETIE,
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.913
YOU WERE AT COLLEGE
TAKING YOUR LSATS, OKAY?

48:35.956 --> 48:39.046
WELL, I APOLOGIZE... AGAIN.

48:39.090 --> 48:42.441
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE EVER
WOULD'VE BEEN A GOOD TIME

48:42.484 --> 48:43.790
TO TELL YOU.

48:43.833 --> 48:46.488
IT'S ALL WATER
UNDER THE BRIDGE.

48:46.532 --> 48:48.969
LISTEN TO HIM. HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW.

48:49.013 --> 48:52.103
HE HASN'T STOPPED LISTENING
TO THAT DAMN SPORTS HAT

48:52.146 --> 48:55.280
SINCE I GAVE IT TO HIM
FOR CHRISTMAS. YOU KNOW THAT?

48:55.323 --> 48:57.325
SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS,

48:57.369 --> 49:01.286
IT IS PROBABLY
A GREAT TIME TO TELL YOU

49:01.329 --> 49:03.114
THAT IT LOOKS LIKE
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

49:03.157 --> 49:07.945
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF A CHRISTIAN WEDDING.

49:10.295 --> 49:12.601
WHAT?

49:12.645 --> 49:14.560
DID YOU HEAR THAT, FRANK?

49:14.603 --> 49:16.779
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

49:16.823 --> 49:18.651
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THEY'RE INTERVIEWING MAZURSKY,

49:18.694 --> 49:19.869
THE NEW QUARTERBACK RECRUIT.

49:19.913 --> 49:21.697
- STOP IT.
- GIVE ME A SECOND.

49:21.741 --> 49:23.090
STOP IT.
YOUR SON JUST ANNOUNCED

49:23.134 --> 49:24.700
HE'S HAVING A CHRISTIAN WEDDING.

49:24.744 --> 49:26.050
SO? I'M CHRISTIAN.

49:26.093 --> 49:27.529
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

49:27.573 --> 49:29.009
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

49:29.053 --> 49:31.577
THEY NEVER WENT TO CHURCH
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

49:31.620 --> 49:33.535
SO? HE NEVER WENT
TO A BUCKEYES GAME WITH ME,

49:33.579 --> 49:35.276
BUT IF YOU ASK HIM
WHO HIS FOOTBALL TEAM IS,

49:35.320 --> 49:37.322
HE WOULD SAY
IT'S OHIO STATE, RIGHT?

49:37.365 --> 49:41.195
YEAH, EXACTLY.
YEAH-- RIGHT, SURE.

49:41.239 --> 49:43.806
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

49:43.850 --> 49:46.026
IT MEANS THAT DARREN'S
A BIG BOY,

49:46.070 --> 49:47.810
AND HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS,

49:47.854 --> 49:50.422
AND YOU NEED TO JUST STAY
OUT OF IT.

49:50.465 --> 49:53.120
AND YOU NEED
TO JUST KEEP LISTENING

49:53.164 --> 49:56.471
TO YOUR DAMN SPORTS HAT.

49:56.515 --> 49:58.952
I NEED A CIGARETTE.
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

50:08.222 --> 50:09.397
WE HAVE WEDDING HERE.

50:09.441 --> 50:12.226
AND HOW MANY
HAVE YOU HAD HERE?

50:12.270 --> 50:14.054
FIRST ONE YESTERDAY.

50:14.098 --> 50:17.362
AND DEAN AND DARREN'S
TOMORROW.

50:17.405 --> 50:19.016
YES, TOMORROW, TOO.

50:19.059 --> 50:21.192
AND MORE COMING ONLINE
ALL THE TIME.

50:23.324 --> 50:25.805
I AM FINE.
I AM FINE. NO PROBLEM.

50:25.848 --> 50:29.113
ISN'T ALEX SUPPOSED TO
BE HANDLING THAT?

50:29.156 --> 50:31.637
EXCUSE ME.

50:37.251 --> 50:39.036
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

50:39.079 --> 50:40.559
DANCING.

50:40.602 --> 50:43.170
THEY'RE GUESTS.
WE'RE THE WORKERS.

50:43.214 --> 50:45.694
BUT I'M WORKING--
HELP THE CELEBRATE, PARTY!

50:45.738 --> 50:49.089
WHAT'S WITH THE GETUP HERE?
WHAT--

50:49.133 --> 50:52.571
IT FEELS RIGHT. YOU LIKE IT?

50:52.614 --> 50:54.399
SURE, SURE, SURE.

50:54.442 --> 50:56.749
- DOES YOUR DAD KNOW ABOUT THIS?
- WHAT?

50:56.792 --> 51:00.100
DOES YOUR DAD KNOW ABOUT THIS?

51:00.144 --> 51:01.884
LOOK, REBECCA'S WORKING
ON THE CHURCH,

51:01.928 --> 51:03.799
DECORATING THE CHAPEL
RIGHT NOW.

51:03.843 --> 51:05.845
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

51:05.888 --> 51:08.848
NOW! THE WOMAN
FROM THE AGENCY'S HERE.

51:09.979 --> 51:13.113
- OH! HEY. HI, THERE.
- HEY.

51:13.157 --> 51:15.333
IT'S QUITE A PARTY HERE. HUH?

51:15.376 --> 51:16.943
TOMORROW'S THE BIG DAY.

51:16.986 --> 51:18.684
WE'RE PREPARING
THE CHAPEL RIGHT NOW.

51:18.727 --> 51:20.251
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

51:20.294 --> 51:24.081
LISTEN, PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY.

51:24.124 --> 51:25.691
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

51:25.734 --> 51:28.998
WELL, I'VE DECIDED

51:29.042 --> 51:33.481
THAT I WANT A--
WELL, ACTUALLY, I NEED

51:33.525 --> 51:35.701
MY WEDDING TO TAKE PLACE
IN A REAL CHURCH

51:35.744 --> 51:37.485
WITH A REAL PRIEST.

51:37.529 --> 51:39.270
SO WHILE I THANK YOU,

51:39.313 --> 51:41.968
THERE'S BEEN
A CHANGE IN PLANS.

51:42.011 --> 51:44.492
I'M A LICENSED
CHRISTIAN MINISTER.

51:44.536 --> 51:47.452
I PREACHED FOR TWO YEARS
IN MISSOURI.

51:47.495 --> 51:51.064
TWO YEARS!
AT JEWS FOR JESUS RETREAT.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.066
ACTUALLY IT WAS MORE
OF A RESORT,

51:53.110 --> 51:55.024
BUT...

51:55.068 --> 51:56.765
WE DID A WONDERFUL BUSINESS,
BY THE WAY.

51:56.809 --> 52:00.247
THE BUSINESS OF SAVING SOULS,
OF COURSE.

52:00.291 --> 52:02.641
THAT'S-- THAT'S GREAT.

52:02.684 --> 52:06.645
BUT, YOU SEE, I'M CATHOLIC,
SO...

52:06.688 --> 52:10.257
I CAN DO A CATHOLIC FLAVOR
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN.

52:10.301 --> 52:13.304
SERIOUSLY, I'LL DO THE WHOLE
THING IN LATIN. THE WHOLE THING.

52:13.347 --> 52:15.306
HERE, I-- I HAVE "CRISTUS,"

52:15.349 --> 52:19.527
I HAVE "AD NUOM,"
UH, "ET BENEDICTO."

52:19.571 --> 52:22.008
IT'S IN THERE.
I KNOW IT'S IN THERE.

52:22.051 --> 52:23.966
I'M COMMITTING MY LIFE
TO ONE PERSON,

52:24.010 --> 52:28.754
SO I NEED SOMEONE WHO'S COMMITTED
THEIR LIFE TO ONE THING.

52:28.797 --> 52:32.975
DO YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
PERMANENTLY ETCH THIS INTO MY--

52:33.019 --> 52:34.977
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S THE WRONG ONE.

52:35.021 --> 52:36.327
HOLD ON.
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

52:36.370 --> 52:38.677
THAT'S COMMITMENT.
A JEW WITH A CROSS.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.548
LOOK AT THAT.

52:40.592 --> 52:43.551
I APPRECIATE IT.
I REALLY DO.

52:43.595 --> 52:47.599
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
I NEED FOR ME.

52:47.642 --> 52:50.515
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

52:53.257 --> 52:55.998
I UNDERSTAND. NO PROBLEM.

52:56.042 --> 52:58.914
HEY, MAN, THIS--
THIS IS AN AWESOME TATTOO.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.960
DID YOU KNOW
THAT GANESH BRINGS GOOD LUCK?

53:02.875 --> 53:04.442
EXCUSE ME.

53:07.227 --> 53:10.056
JUST HAVE A RABBI PRESENT.
IS THAT SO HARD?

53:10.099 --> 53:11.623
YOUR FATHER AND I
WILL PAY FOR IT.

53:11.666 --> 53:13.277
I'LL EVEN FIND YOU ONE.

53:13.320 --> 53:16.149
YOU GOTTA STOP
THE JEWISH THING.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.933
WE HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE
WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP.

53:17.977 --> 53:19.848
YOU'RE SITTING THERE EATING
A BOURBON BACON BURGER

53:19.892 --> 53:21.676
AT A BUSTER BARN.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.201
WHAT PART OF THAT IS JEWISH?

53:24.244 --> 53:27.116
ALL OF IT!
EXCEPT THE BUSTER BARN!

53:27.160 --> 53:29.771
HE'S GOT A POINT, MOM.

53:29.815 --> 53:31.120
THANK YOU.

53:31.164 --> 53:34.646
THIS IS WHAT WE DO AS JEWS,

53:34.689 --> 53:37.388
WE GET TO EAT BACON
ONCE IN A WHILE

53:37.431 --> 53:42.044
WITHOUT ANY ONE PERSON GETTING
STONED TO DEATH FOR IT.

53:42.088 --> 53:45.309
AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH
HAVING A TREE, HUH? HUH?

53:45.352 --> 53:48.616
WHY CAN'T WE ENJOY THE FRUITS
OF OTHER RELIGIONS?

53:48.660 --> 53:50.270
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I GOTTA GIVE UP MINE.

53:50.314 --> 53:52.490
SURE, FINE, AND THAT SOMEHOW
WORKS FOR YOU.

53:52.533 --> 53:55.754
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW,
BUT SOMEHOW IT DOES.

53:55.797 --> 53:58.104
BUT THIS IS MY WEDDING.

53:58.147 --> 54:00.846
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS TO ME,
AREN'T YOU?

54:00.889 --> 54:02.848
LOOK AT ME, DARREN.

54:02.891 --> 54:07.505
IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS OF
FIVE-DAY-A-WEEK THERAPY SESSIONS,

54:07.548 --> 54:09.550
A NASTY XANAX ADDICTION,

54:09.594 --> 54:10.856
AND ENDLESS WATCHING

54:10.899 --> 54:14.076
OF THOSE BORING
PBS DOCUMENTARIES

54:14.120 --> 54:16.949
TO FINALLY ACCEPT
THIS GAY MARRIAGE THING.

54:16.992 --> 54:21.301
AND NOW YOU EXPECT ME
TO ABANDON MY FAITH?

54:23.042 --> 54:25.479
- MY GOD!
- SHH.

54:32.573 --> 54:38.449
- SHH.
- I EVEN MADE YOUR FATHER WATCH "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN." TWICE!

54:38.492 --> 54:41.408
AND THEN WENT OUT AND GO BUY
THE BLU-RAY EDITION.

54:41.452 --> 54:45.151
HE HAD TO WAIT IN LINE
AT BEST BUY

54:45.194 --> 54:48.328
FOR 10 MINUTES HOLDING
THAT THING

54:48.372 --> 54:52.463
IN FRONT OF ALL THE NEIGHBORS
ON BLACK FRIDAY.

54:52.506 --> 54:56.075
WE'VE MADE SACRIFICES.

54:56.118 --> 54:59.121
AND I'M JUST ASKING
FOR THIS ONE THING?

54:59.165 --> 55:02.124
OH, GOD, I CAN'T TAKE THIS!

55:02.168 --> 55:03.778
I HAVE TO GO TAKE CARE
OF DEAN.

55:03.822 --> 55:06.172
YOUR GRANDFATHER
IS ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE.

55:06.215 --> 55:09.349
AND THAT'S AFTER HE'S ALREADY
ROLLED A HOLE TO CHINA!

55:09.393 --> 55:13.440
MOM, YOU NEED TO STOP.

55:15.224 --> 55:17.923
WHY CAN'T HE JUST GET MARRIED
LIKE HE DID WITH MAGGIE?

55:17.966 --> 55:19.490
WAS THERE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH THAT?

55:19.533 --> 55:22.667
THE RABBI DID
SUCH A MARVELOUS JOB.

55:22.710 --> 55:26.975
WELL, MAGGIE'S STILL JEWISH,
AND SHE'LL BE HERE SOON.

55:27.019 --> 55:28.847
MAGGIE'S STILL JEWISH?

55:28.890 --> 55:30.457
SHE'S COMING TO THE WEDDING?

55:30.501 --> 55:33.068
TURNS OUT SHE DIDN'T SIGN
THE DIVORCE PAPERS,

55:33.112 --> 55:34.374
SO SHE'LL BE HERE.

55:34.418 --> 55:36.028
SHE LIVES IN BINGHAMTON.

55:36.071 --> 55:37.377
SHE'S A PROFESSOR
AT A UNIVERSITY.

55:37.421 --> 55:40.815
- REALLY?
- DON'T GET ANY IDEAS, MOM.

55:40.859 --> 55:44.558
OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ISAAC? I JUST LOVE HER.

55:44.602 --> 55:46.473
SHE'S WONDERFUL.
I ALWAYS LIKED HER.

55:46.517 --> 55:50.303
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

55:50.347 --> 55:54.525
MOM, DO NOT START ANYTHING.

55:54.568 --> 55:57.615
SHE'S COMING HERE
AND SHE'S SIGNING THE PAPERS,

55:57.658 --> 56:00.879
AND SHE'S LEAVING.
THAT'S ALL.

56:06.014 --> 56:10.802
WOW, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS PLACE?
IT'S PERFECT.

56:10.845 --> 56:12.194
OKAY, DO ME A FAVOR.

56:12.238 --> 56:14.501
DON'T EVER RANK ANYTHING
ON TRIPADVISOR.COM

56:14.545 --> 56:17.243
I USE IT. DON'T NEED
THE EXTRA FEEDBACK.

56:17.286 --> 56:19.680
WHY, DO YOU THINK
WE'RE IN DANGER?

56:19.724 --> 56:21.769
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GAY,

56:21.813 --> 56:24.250
HANGING OUT IN KLAN TERRITORY,

56:24.293 --> 56:25.643
LOITERING IN FRONT
OF THEIR CHURCH.

56:25.686 --> 56:27.688
I MEAN, IT SEEMS
LIKE WE HIT THE TRIFECTA.

56:27.732 --> 56:29.560
THEN MAYBE
WE SHOULD TURN BACK.

56:29.603 --> 56:31.779
NO, I'M SURE WE'LL BE FINE.

56:31.823 --> 56:34.216
JUST-- COME ON.
JUST BUTCH IT UP A BIT.

56:34.260 --> 56:37.219
- OH, OKAY. UM...
- YEAH.

56:37.263 --> 56:39.439
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS ISN'T "WEST SIDE STORY."

56:39.483 --> 56:41.615
DOWN. IT'S BETTER DOWN?

56:44.488 --> 56:46.751
JUST HURRY UP BEFORE
THAT CROSS GOES UP IN FLAMES.

56:46.794 --> 56:48.056
A PLACE LIKE THIS MIGHT BE
AVAILABLE

56:48.100 --> 56:50.058
BECAUSE IT'S
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

56:54.628 --> 56:58.502
HELLO. HOW CAN I HELP YOU
FINE YOUNG MEN?

56:58.545 --> 57:03.811
GENTLEMEN,
ISN'T GOD'S HOUSE BEAUTIFUL?

57:03.855 --> 57:07.119
OH, I FEEL INSPIRED
BY THE HOLY SPIRIT

57:07.162 --> 57:11.776
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT THIS
INCREDIBLE PLACE.

57:11.819 --> 57:13.473
WOW, IT'S--

57:13.517 --> 57:16.302
IT'S UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL.

57:16.345 --> 57:20.219
OF COURSE, WE HAD A BALL SAIL
THROUGH THAT WINDOW

57:20.262 --> 57:23.788
A FEW YEARS AGO.

57:23.831 --> 57:25.442
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

57:25.485 --> 57:27.313
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE SIGN

57:27.356 --> 57:32.492
THAT THIS TRULY IS A VIBRANT,
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD.

57:32.536 --> 57:36.540
BRADLEY,
IT'S EVERYTHING WE WANTED.

57:36.583 --> 57:38.019
LOOK AT THAT CHANDELIER.

57:39.673 --> 57:43.329
OH, THIS CHANDELIER
IS THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING.

57:43.372 --> 57:47.855
I MADE A SNOWMAN ONCE
IN THREE HOURS...

57:47.899 --> 57:51.076
AND THEN I GOT BORED
AND SAT ON IT.

57:51.119 --> 57:55.472
- CAN WE TURN IT ON, FATHER?
- YEAH, SOME OF THE WIRES--

57:55.515 --> 57:58.518
I-- I FORGOT TO MENTION,

57:58.562 --> 58:01.869
DID YOU NOTICE OUR INCREDIBLY
BEAUTIFUL CHURCH ORGAN?

58:01.913 --> 58:04.481
WOW.

58:04.524 --> 58:06.787
ARE YOU BOYS FROM THE CASINO?

58:06.831 --> 58:08.963
- WHAT?
- UH, NO, NO. UH...

58:09.007 --> 58:10.835
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
CASINO GUYS.

58:10.878 --> 58:12.489
- IS MY COLLAR STILL UP?
- NO, NO.

58:12.532 --> 58:15.274
NO, UH, TRUTHFULLY,
I DON'T REALLY EVEN GAMBLE.

58:15.317 --> 58:16.580
THAT'S A SIN, RIGHT?

58:16.623 --> 58:19.321
YOU ARE LOOKING
FOR A SPIRITUAL HOME?

58:19.365 --> 58:22.542
UH, NO.
WELL, YES, BUT...

58:22.586 --> 58:24.849
DO YOU STILL HOLD
SERVICES HERE?

58:24.892 --> 58:28.113
I GUESS, COMMUNIONS,
MASSES, WEDDINGS?

58:28.156 --> 58:29.897
WE STILL HAVE A SUNDAY MASS.

58:29.941 --> 58:32.204
IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS
SINCE WE'VE HAD A WEDDING.

58:32.247 --> 58:34.336
ARE YOU AFFILIATED
WITH THE CHURCH RIGHT NOW?

58:34.380 --> 58:36.948
I'M SEARCHING.

58:36.991 --> 58:38.645
STILL SEARCHING.

58:38.689 --> 58:41.213
BUT THIS PLACE IS GREAT,
FATHER.

58:41.256 --> 58:43.911
WELL, I AM CATHOLIC, AND I--

58:43.955 --> 58:46.131
OH, PERFECT.
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU

58:46.174 --> 58:48.263
AS OUR GUESTS
FOR SUNDAY SERVICE.

58:48.307 --> 58:50.701
THAT'S INCREDIBLY KIND OF YOU.

58:50.744 --> 58:52.920
BUT WE'RE HERE--
WELL, I'M HERE

58:52.964 --> 58:56.620
BECAUSE I JUST, UH...

58:58.578 --> 59:00.493
CAN I MAKE A CONFESSION?

59:02.103 --> 59:04.366
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

59:04.410 --> 59:07.413
IT'S BEEN 525,600 MINUTES

59:07.456 --> 59:08.762
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

59:10.938 --> 59:11.896
OH, GOD.

59:11.939 --> 59:14.376
I'M SORRY.

59:14.420 --> 59:16.727
GO AHEAD, MY SON.

59:16.770 --> 59:19.730
WELL, YOU SEE, FATHER,
I'M GAY AND--

59:19.773 --> 59:24.604
OH, REALLY.
WELL, WE'RE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN, AND--

59:24.648 --> 59:27.564
NO, I'M NOT CONFESSING
THAT AS A SIN.

59:27.607 --> 59:31.393
I'M ACTUALLY COMPLETELY FINE
AND PROUD OF BEING GAY.

59:31.437 --> 59:33.091
I'M NOT SURE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT,

59:33.134 --> 59:35.833
BUT TRUTHFULLY, I DON'T EVEN
WANNA CONFESS ANYTHING.

59:35.876 --> 59:38.009
I JUST--
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

59:42.013 --> 59:43.362
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

59:43.405 --> 59:44.624
TO A WOMAN?

59:44.668 --> 59:48.410
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
REALLY, FATHER?

59:48.454 --> 59:50.587
TO MY PARTNER DARREN.

59:50.630 --> 59:55.417
YOU SEE, HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
THAT OUR WEDDING IS REAL,

59:55.461 --> 59:58.986
SO I THOUGHT SINCE I STILL
BELIEVE VERY MUCH IN GOD

59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.598
AND JESUS OR JESUS AND GOD,

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:03.425
OR SOMEWHERE
THE HOLY SPIRIT IS IN THERE,

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:08.430
BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WE COULD GET MARRIED

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:11.782
BY A REAL CLERGYMAN
IN A REAL CHURCH.

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:17.222
OH. MY SON, THE CHURCH
DOES NOT ALLOW GAY MARRIAGE.

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:20.007
I COULDN'T PERFORM
SUCH A CEREMONY IN A CHURCH.

01:00:20.051 --> 01:00:24.621
YOU DON'T NEED ME
TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING REAL.

01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:28.102
THE COMMUNION OF TWO SOULS

01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:32.672
IS AS REAL AS THE LOVE
THAT YOU HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER.

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:37.242
THANK YOU, FATHER, BUT...

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:38.809
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT THE LOVE

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.245
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
HAS FOR YOU

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.682
IS THE SAME
THAT YOU HAVE FOR THEM?

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:47.252
WHEN THAT PERSON DOES
SOMETHING

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:50.255
THAT NO OTHER PERSON
WOULD DO FOR YOU.

01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:54.781
THANK YOU.

01:00:57.871 --> 01:01:02.049
YOU GET IT? YOU GET IT?

01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:05.531
HEY, LOOK AT THAT!
THE JACUZZI IS WORKING!

01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:08.403
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS HERE,
LIDIA.

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:12.843
I CAN CALL YOU THAT.
CAN I-- CAN I CALL YOU LIDIA?

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.061
WHY WOULD YOU?

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:15.846
IT JUST ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE.

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:18.457
LIDIA, LIDIA.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.373
OH, SAYA'S THE SENIOR MEMBER
OF THE GROUP.

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.201
HE ACTUALLY FIXED THE JACUZZI.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:24.898
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
JUST AMAZING.

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:26.900
HOW DO YOU GUYS LIKE IT?

01:01:26.944 --> 01:01:30.251
- THERE'S NO BUBBLES!
- IT'S KIND OF COLD.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:33.298
AWESOME KIDDIE POOL, DUDE.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:36.736
YOU ARE THE MANISCHEWITZ.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.955
WHOO!

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:41.654
WELL, MR. SHIBBAWITZ,

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.310
THIS HAS BEEN
AN ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE,

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.704
BUT I'M NOT VERY CONVINCED
THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:50.315
OH, BUT IT IS WORKING,
MISS CARMICHAEL.

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.709
ONE WEDDING
IS HARDLY A SUCCESS STORY.

01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.623
NO, IT'S TWO WEDDINGS.

01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:58.323
- MANISCHEWITZ.
- YOU LIKE THAT? YOU LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

01:01:58.366 --> 01:02:01.326
MR. SHIBBAWITZ, I HEARD
THAT YOUNG GAY MAN CLEARLY SAY

01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:03.110
HE IS NOT GETTING
MARRIED HERE.

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:06.113
AND TO BE HONEST,
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:07.854
THAT YOUNG MAN WILL BE BACK.

01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:10.291
NO CATHOLIC CHURCH
IS GOING TO MARRY TWO MEN.

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:12.032
I DON'T THINK THE POPE
IS GOING TO RENEGE

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:14.252
ON 2,000 YEARS
OF CATHOLIC DOCTRINE

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:15.470
IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS.

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:17.734
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL HIM THAT?

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.910
BECAUSE THIS IS
WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO.

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:23.914
THIS IS HIS JOURNEY,
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'LL FIND.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.220
I'M NOT HERE TO SQUASH
A PERSON'S DREAMS.

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:31.312
AT THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL,
WE MAKE DREAMS COME TRUE.

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:36.361
IF HE'S GETTING MARRIED
HERE TOMORROW,

01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:38.972
YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM.

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:41.932
MAYBE, BUT HAVEN'T
THEY BEEN TOLD

01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:46.675
ENOUGH THINGS
THEY CAN'T DO, LIDIA?

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:49.113
LOOK, ANOTHER GUEST.

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:50.767
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.594
NO, I CAN WAIT
TILL YOU'RE FINISHED.

01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:56.381
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WAS JUST FINISHING UP HERE.

01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.252
- HI.
- HI.

01:02:58.296 --> 01:03:00.515
I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.735
I'M HERE TO SIGN
SOME MARRIAGE PAPERS

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.564
- FOR MY FORMER--
- OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:07.827
YOUR NAME IS...

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.960
- MAGGIE.
- MAGGIE! MAGGIE!

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:12.179
NOT ANOTHER GUEST.

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:15.182
SHE'S ACTUALLY MARRIED
TO DEAN. UH, DARREN.

01:03:15.226 --> 01:03:17.837
DARREN IS MARRYING DEAN--
THE YOUNG MAN WE MET.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:22.450
MR. SHIBBAWITZ, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.

01:03:22.494 --> 01:03:25.105
AHEAD? REALLY?

01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:28.413
I'LL TAKE THAT.

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:30.632
- OH, GOD.
- IT'S TIME TO FEED THE BURT REYNOLDS.

01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:33.505
IT'S MORE LIKE MEATLOAF.

01:03:33.548 --> 01:03:37.683
OOH!
AREN'T YOU A SWEET THANG.

01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:46.735
UGH. NO THANKS.

01:03:46.779 --> 01:03:49.216
MY MEDICAL THERMOS?

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.915
YES, YES,
YOUR MEDICAL THERMOS.

01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:17.462
OH, MY GOD!

01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:19.725
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:42.313
JUST SUCH A STATELY
CHARM ABOUT YOU.

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:44.445
A VERY CONSERVATIVE BEAUTY.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:46.883
ALL THIS LIGHT
THAT COMES FROM YOU.

01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:50.103
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.064
...IT JUST COMES
RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:57.023
YOU JUST--
YOU LOOK BRIGHT.

01:04:57.067 --> 01:05:00.331
OH, I SEE.

01:05:00.374 --> 01:05:03.290
THAT SMILE! I CAN'T SEE.

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.684
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
FILLING OUT THIS FORM

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:07.729
THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO BE NEEDING

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:10.080
FOR YOUR EXTENSION.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.038
REALLY?

01:05:12.082 --> 01:05:14.301
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:17.391
TRULY IS
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE MOTEL.

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:21.439
WHOO!

01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:23.093
IT WAS A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE DISPLAY,

01:05:23.136 --> 01:05:24.572
BUT, YOU KNOW...

01:05:29.795 --> 01:05:31.797
- DARREN!
- MOM?

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.192
DARREN! CONGRATULATIONS!

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:37.455
OH, MAGGIE!

01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:40.937
- OH, MY GOD. HI, FRAN!
- HI.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.764
- WE THOUGHT THAT YOU GOT SUCKED INTO...
- GET OUT OF MY WAY.

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.984
ONE OF THOSE
GIANT VENTS OUT THERE.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:48.857
WE DID!
AND WE LOST IT.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:51.991
SO, HERE YOU GO AGAIN, HUH?

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:54.124
THIS PLACE IS--

01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:58.128
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:01.348
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
THE ONLY GIRL FOR MY BOY.

01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:04.134
- THAT WOULD BE YOU.
- THAT'S VERY SWEET, FRAN,

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:05.918
BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT NECESSARY.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.877
I'M SURE SHE'S WONDERFUL.

01:06:10.836 --> 01:06:12.272
AWESOME!

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:18.278
- HI, DARREN.
- HI, MAGGIE.

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:21.281
WOW, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

01:06:21.325 --> 01:06:23.153
- YOU HAVEN'T AGED A DAY.
- DOESN'T SHE KNOW?

01:06:23.196 --> 01:06:25.372
THANK YOU.
AND YOU, TOO.

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.809
YOU LOOK EXACTLY
THE WAY I REMEMBER YOU.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:31.030
EXCEPT I DON'T THINK I EVER SAW
THAT COLOR SHIRT ON YOU.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:33.424
EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SAME.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.906
I'LL JUST GO GET
THE PAPERS, MAGGIE,

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.996
AND GET YOUR OLD JOHN HANCOCK

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:42.259
AND GET YOU
RIGHT ON YOUR WAY. OKAY?

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:43.825
THAT SOUND GOOD? OKAY.

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.089
I GUESS, CONGRATULATIONS.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:50.093
YEAH! OH, YEAH, YEAH.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:52.530
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HER A HUG.
THAT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:58.188
OKAY. OKAY.

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:00.886
GREAT.

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:04.890
SO, UH... THANKS, MAGGIE.

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.892
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT YOU'RE
DOING THIS FOR ME.

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:10.852
I'M ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.
HOW WAS THE DRIVE?

01:07:10.896 --> 01:07:14.595
NOT BAD.
ONLY 2 1/2, 3 HOURS.

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:16.989
OH, GREAT, GREAT.
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.035
THERE'S ONLY ONE PAGE
THAT NEEDS TO BE SIGNED.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:22.125
YOU CAN STILL MAKE IT BACK
WITH ENOUGH DAYLIGHT DRIVING.

01:07:22.168 --> 01:07:24.866
- HAVE YOU TOLD HER?
- MOM...

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.433
MAGGIE AND I HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THIS,

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:28.609
- AND WE'RE GOOD.
- WE WHAT?

01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:30.524
DO NOT BRING THAT UP.

01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:32.222
SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO KNOW
AT THIS POINT.

01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:33.875
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:35.442
THIS WASN'T THE THING
YOU WERE TRYING TO TELL ME

01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:37.662
WHEN WE GOT DISCONNECTED,
IS IT?

01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:40.230
DARREN TELLS ME THAT
YOU'RE STILL JEWISH, MAGGIE.

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:42.667
YEAH, YEAH,
I SAID I WAS JEWISH AT THE WEDDING,

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:44.495
- AND I STILL AM.
- FANTASTIC.

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:47.672
WORKS FOR ME.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:49.674
- I'CHAIM!
- YEAH!

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:53.460
- LOOK AT THAT FACE.
- OH, GOD.

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:55.897
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:58.900
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? ARE YOU A
BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN NOW OR SOMETHING?

01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:00.815
WHAT IS THIS?

01:08:00.859 --> 01:08:03.253
NO, NO.
I'M EXACTLY THE SAME.

01:08:03.296 --> 01:08:05.472
NO, I'M NOT.

01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:09.911
UM, I JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:12.740
- YOU KNOW, UH...
- I GOT THE PAPERS RIGHT HERE, MAGGIE.

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:14.002
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON
OVER HERE,

01:08:14.046 --> 01:08:17.615
STEP UP TO THE COUNTER,
AND-- AND SIGN.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:21.880
WOW, YOU REALLY DON'T WASTE
ANY TIME HERE, DO YOU?

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:25.710
SO THIS IS HOW IT'S GOING TO BE?
GET ME IN, GET ME OUT?

01:08:25.752 --> 01:08:27.493
NO, NO. NO.
NO, NO, NO.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.715
IT'S NOT HOW IT IS.

01:08:30.758 --> 01:08:34.719
LISTEN, MAGGIE, WHY DON'T YOU AND
DARREN GO OFF SOMEWHERE AND TALK?

01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:37.939
- SHE TOOK A LONG RIDE HERE.
- I UNDERSTAND.

01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:40.290
IT COULD BE AWKWARD
FOR YOUR FIANCEÉE.

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:41.551
IS SHE HERE?

01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:44.772
UH...

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:50.778
YOU MADE MOTEL
INTO GAY PARTY HOUSE!

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.953
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:54.956
MY SON TURN
INTO GAY RIGHT HERE.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.785
TIN, WE HAVE GUESTS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:08:57.828 --> 01:08:59.309
THE LADY
FROM THE AGENCY'S HERE.

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:01.310
EXCUSE ME. HERE'S YOUR PEN.
YOU CAN SIGN IT.

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.965
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
GET IN THERE.

01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:06.446
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
- THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL--

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:10.537
- HELLO THERE, DARREN.
- HELL.

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.800
WE'VE BEEN WONDERING WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING OUT.

01:09:12.844 --> 01:09:15.586
DEAN DIDN'T
SCARE YOU STRAIGHT, DID HE?

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.981
OR MAYBE HE HAS.

01:09:20.024 --> 01:09:22.113
HELLO, I'M BRADLEY,

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.376
DEAN'S BEST FRIEND.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.551
DEAN?

01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:27.685
FRAN, DARREN'S MOTHER.

01:09:27.728 --> 01:09:29.991
AND THIS HERE
IS OUR LOVELY MAGGIE.

01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:32.645
THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO GET
SOME COFFEE.

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.560
EXCUSE US.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.173
THIS MOTEL MADE
MY SON INTO GAY.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.175
TIN, THE KID
IS FINALLY HAPPY.

01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:41.350
YOU SAID THIS MOTEL
WAS FOR US!

01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:43.135
SHOULD WE GO BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS,

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.572
WAITING FOR TRUCKERS TO CHECK IN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:48.401
TO MEET UP WITH THEIR HOOKERS
AND METH DEALERS?

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:55.800
OH, I'M-- I'M REALLY SORRY.

01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:57.845
I'M-- I'M SO SORRY.

01:09:57.889 --> 01:10:00.544
WHERE'S MY HORMONES?
MY HORMONES ARE GONE!

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.154
- DAW THOUGHT IT WAS AN ENERGY DRINK.
- THEY'RE GONE!

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.809
IT'S JUST NOTHING MORE
THAN A CULTURAL FAUX PAS.

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.987
- OH, MY GOD!
- OH, MY GOD!

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.075
OH, MY GOD!

01:10:12.295 --> 01:10:14.035
ARE YOU OKAY?
CAN I GET YOU A--

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.123
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:16.386
LET ME GET YOU SOME ICE!

01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.822
PLEASE, MOM, NO!
I DO NOT NEED ICE!

01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:19.606
WE'RE ALL LOVERS HERE, BABY.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.782
DID YOU BLACK OUT?
LET ME SEE YOUR EYES.

01:10:21.826 --> 01:10:23.610
- YOU'RE BLEEDING. PUT THIS AGAINST YOUR LIP.
- I AM NOT BLEEDING.

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:25.873
PUPILS ARE THE SAME SIZE.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:29.964
I'M FINE! I'M FINE!
EVERYBODY JUST STEP AWAY.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:31.270
OKAY.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:35.013
HI, I'M DEAN,
DARREN'S FIANCEÉ.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:39.235
- YOU MUST BE MAGGIE.
- FIANCEÉ?

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:42.890
DARREN, YOU'RE GAY?

01:10:44.762 --> 01:10:46.285
WOW.

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:49.636
GAY? HOW COULD I HAVE NOT
FIGURED THIS OUT?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.769
YOU MEAN, YOU DIDN'T PICK UP
ON THE SIGNS, SWEETIE?

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:55.076
BACKWARDS BASEBALL CAPS,
SWEATY T-SHIRTS, MURALS?

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.210
- IT'S ALL SO OBVIOUS.
- STAY OUT OF THIS, BRADLEY.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.864
PARDON ME,
BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:01.431
WE ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW.

01:11:01.474 --> 01:11:04.085
ARE YOU BUTCH CASSIDY
OR THE SUNDANCE KID?

01:11:04.129 --> 01:11:09.265
WELL, HI, I'M MAGGIE,
THE APPARENTLY CLUELESS JILTED EX-WIFE.

01:11:09.308 --> 01:11:10.657
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER.

01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:13.138
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:15.662
I DIDN'T WANNA BOTHER HER.
IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS.

01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:17.316
WHAT'S THE POINT?
WHY DOES SHE NEED TO KNOW?

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.926
BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH.

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.537
I'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND
THESE 10 YEARS

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.016
WONDERING
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.801
SHOULD I HAVE DYED
MY HAIR BLONDE?

01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:26.020
SHOULD I HAVE COOKED
MORE ITALIAN FOOD?

01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:28.458
SHOULD I HAVE WORN THAT BLACK
LEATHER LINGERIE YOU BOUGHT ME?

01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:29.937
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUR THING.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.287
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.940
YOURS HAS THOSE BUCKLES.

01:11:32.984 --> 01:11:35.639
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO OUT
AND GET SOME AIR.

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:37.423
GOOD LUCK.
THERE'S NOT ANY OUT THERE.

01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:40.339
INCREDIBLE.

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:42.907
AFTER ALL THE RIGHTS
WE'VE FOUGHT FOR,

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.301
AND YOU'RE STILL AFRAID,
AREN'T YOU, DARREN?

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:46.606
AFRAID OF WHAT, DEAN?

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.827
THIS? YES.
YES, I'M AFRAID OF THIS.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.481
THIS IS MADNESS.

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:54.048
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS HOPING TO AVOID.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:57.704
NOBODY NEEDED
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

01:11:57.748 --> 01:12:00.316
IS THAT WHY
YOU CHOSE THIS PLACE,

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:04.320
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS HERE
IN THE GAY WEDDING CAPITAL?

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:06.147
IS THAT WHY WE'RE HERE,

01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:08.759
THOUSANDS OF MILES
AWAY FROM OUR HOME?

01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:11.544
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS
FROM WORK?

01:12:11.588 --> 01:12:12.980
OH, I GET IT.

01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:15.505
A GAY DESTINATION WEDDING
IN NIAGARA FALLS

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:17.158
OFFERS A PERFECT EXCUSE

01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:19.291
NOT TO INVITE ANYONE
FROM OUR LIVES.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.163
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT THE ONE HIDING OUT, DEAN?

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:23.948
YOU'RE A CANADIAN CITIZEN.
YEAH.

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.342
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IN ARIZONA?

01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:29.432
WOW. HOW DARE YOU QUESTION
MY ASTHMA.

01:12:29.475 --> 01:12:31.042
YOU KNOW I NEED
A DESERT CLIMATE.

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:33.523
I DO, AND I KNOW
THAT YOU WANTED

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:36.743
TO SEE NIAGARA FALLS
JUST AS MUCH AS I DID.

01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:40.530
BUT WHEN WE GOT HERE,
I JUST ACCEPTED THE KITSCH FACTOR.

01:12:40.573 --> 01:12:44.055
BUT YOU REFUSE TO SEE IT.
LONZIE GETS IT!

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:45.970
LONZIE LIVES IN
AN ABANDONED MISSILE SILO.

01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:48.320
THAT'S NOT THE STRONGEST
ARGUMENT, DARREN!

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.454
REALLY?
ARE THOSE STILL AVAILABLE?

01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:57.721
WOW, I GET IT.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:13:02.552
YOU WANT A NICE, QUIET,
HIDDEN GAY LIFE.

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:05.163
HELL, YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE A FLING
WITH A WOMAN AGAIN SOME DAY.

01:13:05.206 --> 01:13:07.208
YOU'RE STILL CLOSETED, DARREN,

01:13:07.252 --> 01:13:10.821
IT'S JUST NOW IT'S
A SLIGHTLY ROOMIER ONE.

01:13:12.736 --> 01:13:15.391
I WANTED A CROSS

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:19.003
AND A JESUS AND A PRIEST.

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:22.006
I HAD NO IDEA
I NEEDED A PARTNER

01:13:22.049 --> 01:13:23.399
WHO WAS WILLING
TO BE HIMSELF.

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:28.795
I'M GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW,

01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:31.276
AND I HAVE NO IDEA IF I HAVE
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:38.588
HEY! HEY! HEY!

01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.590
PARTY IN CANADA!

01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:43.419
PARTY IN CANADA-LA-LA-LA!

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:46.291
COME ON. LET'S GO!

01:13:46.334 --> 01:13:48.598
IF YOU ASK ME,
I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN HANDLE

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:50.034
ANY FOREIGN AFFAIRS RIGHT NOW

01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:54.865
UNTIL YOU TACKLE
YOUR DOMESTIC ISSUES.

01:14:11.795 --> 01:14:13.840
MAGGIE. MAGGIE, I'M SORRY.

01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:16.974
IT'S JUST LIKE A PUZZLE.

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:18.976
MAGGIE, I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:20.891
I SIGNED YOUR PAPERS. THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANTED. THAT'S WHAT I DID.

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:23.284
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW LIFE,
DARREN.

01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:24.460
I HOPE YOU'RE
MORE HONEST WITH DEAN

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:25.896
THAN YOU WERE WITH ME.

01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:27.463
MAGGIE, THIS IS NOT
HOW I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

01:14:27.506 --> 01:14:29.290
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:31.728
I'LL HAVE A NICE, PLEASANT
THREE-HOUR DRIVE HOME

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.077
THINKING ABOUT NOTHING ELSE

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.470
EXCEPT HOW I TURNED
THE MAN I LOVE

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:35.949
INTO LOVING ANOTHER MAN.

01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:37.951
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:40.127
BELIEVE ME.
IT'S NOT EVEN RELATED.

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:43.087
- UGH!
- I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE DRIVING.

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:46.090
NO, I'M FINE. THERE ARE OVER A
HUNDRED WINERIES ON THE WAY HOME.

01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:47.657
I'LL JUST STICK
TO THE DRY REDS,

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.659
VENTURE INTO
THE FRUITY BLUSHES,

01:14:49.702 --> 01:14:51.574
AND IF I STILL CAN'T STOP
BLAMING MYSELF,

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:54.620
I'LL HIT
THE CABERNET SAUVIGNONS.

01:14:54.664 --> 01:14:56.796
HOPEFULLY I'LL REMEMBER
TO TAKE IN THE VIEWS.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.843
MAGGIE! PLEASE.

01:14:59.886 --> 01:15:02.802
PLEASE, MAGGIE, MAGGIE.
MAGGIE, WAIT.

01:15:02.846 --> 01:15:04.717
GOOD-BYE, FRAN.

01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:11.724
HI, ISAAC. SORRY WE DIDN'T
GET A CHANCE TO CATCH UP.

01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:20.341
DARREN,

01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.561
YOU ARE NOT GONNA LET HER GO.

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:25.782
LOOK AT YOU TWO.

01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:28.132
YOU STILL HAVE CHEMISTRY.

01:15:28.175 --> 01:15:31.135
- YOU WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
- MOM.

01:15:31.178 --> 01:15:34.660
I'M YOUR MOTHER.
I KNOW THESE THINGS.

01:15:34.704 --> 01:15:37.707
MOM, WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:42.233
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:46.542
AND IT DOESN'T HURT THAT SHE'S
STILL A MEMBER OF THE TRIBE.

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:49.545
YOU'RE NOT JEWISH.

01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:52.983
YOU'RE NOT.

01:15:53.026 --> 01:15:54.506
HAVING A GREAT-GRANDFATHER

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.377
ON YOUR FATHER'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY

01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:59.555
DOES NOT MAKE YOU JEWISH!

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:01.382
EVEN THE NAZIS
WOULD GIVE YOU A PASS,

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:02.949
BUT THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME ONE

01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:05.430
BECAUSE I AM
A HUNDRED PERCENT GAY!

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.174
I'M GAY.

01:16:18.922 --> 01:16:22.403
YOU EXHAUST ME.

01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:28.192
WHAT KIND OF LIFE ARE YOU
AND DEAN GOING TO LIVE?

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:32.631
HOW CAN YOU LET
THIS GIRL GO AGAIN?

01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:39.203
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:41.771
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:43.990
I'M NOT GONNA
LET MAGGIE GO THIS TIME.

01:16:44.034 --> 01:16:45.035
BLESS YOU.

01:16:47.298 --> 01:16:48.821
MAGGIE...

01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:53.391
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE SEVENTH GRADE.

01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:56.786
YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:00.877
I WANT MY FRIEND BACK.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.835
I'M NOT GOING TO
GO ANOTHER 10 YEARS

01:17:02.879 --> 01:17:04.271
WITHOUT YOU IN MY LIFE.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:09.625
MAGGIE,

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:13.019
WILL YOU BE MY--

01:17:13.063 --> 01:17:15.805
MY BEST MAN?

01:17:15.848 --> 01:17:19.286
OR BEST WOMAN.

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.245
- I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS SO--
- OY GEVALT.

01:17:21.288 --> 01:17:24.074
- THIS IS NOT EASY.
- I KNOW.

01:17:35.738 --> 01:17:38.001
JUST SAY YES.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:40.307
UH, HUG.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:44.572
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE?

01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:46.749
I'M SORRY.

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:56.454
WE WERE FRIENDS A LOT LONGER
THAN WE WERE A MARRIED COUPLE.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:00.676
WE CAN DO THIS, RIGHT?

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:03.853
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

01:18:04.984 --> 01:18:09.728
NOW, MY LOVELY JEWESS,

01:18:09.772 --> 01:18:12.862
WILL YOU HELP ME STEAL
A CROSS AND A JESUS?

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:36.146
AND WE CAN'T FIND LONZIE.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.756
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DESERT,

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.149
TRIPPING ON PEYOTE,

01:18:39.192 --> 01:18:40.890
COMPLETELY PANICKED.

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:43.980
OH, MY GOD,
WHO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER?

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:45.764
YOUR FUTURE
SON-IN-LAW DARREN.

01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:47.461
AND THIS IS THE PLACE
WHERE THEY EXPLODED

01:18:47.505 --> 01:18:49.507
- THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB?
- EXACTLY.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.117
AND WE LOOK BEHIND US,

01:18:51.161 --> 01:18:55.426
AND THERE IS LONZIE
CUMMING ON GROUND ZERO

01:18:55.469 --> 01:18:57.994
WITH A JAPANESE MAN!

01:18:58.037 --> 01:19:02.999
- IT'S LIKE--
- IT WAS THE MAKEUP SEX FOR WORLD WAR II, OKAY?

01:19:08.613 --> 01:19:09.832
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:13.487
STOP POUTING.

01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:16.621
DARREN IS A GREAT,
CREATIVE GUY.

01:19:18.841 --> 01:19:21.582
HE DOES THIS.
HE GETS ALL QUIET WHEN HE'S UPSET.

01:19:21.626 --> 01:19:24.672
STOP IT.

01:19:24.716 --> 01:19:26.500
COME ON, IT'S YOUR WEDDING.

01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:34.204
OKAY, BOYS, THIS OLD HAG
HAS TO GET TO BED.

01:19:38.295 --> 01:19:40.776
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO. COME ON.

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.734
DON'T WORRY, MRS. D.,
WE'LL KEEP THE ORGY

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.953
TO JUST UNDER 10 PEOPLE.

01:19:43.996 --> 01:19:45.389
THAT'S MY BOYS.

01:19:47.347 --> 01:19:48.566
SMILE!

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:52.091
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

01:20:07.846 --> 01:20:10.414
WHERE DID HE GO?
DO YOU SEE HIM?

01:20:10.457 --> 01:20:11.981
I THINK HE WENT
BEHIND THE CHURCH.

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:13.809
YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS?
IT'S REALLY DARK.

01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:15.636
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE 99-CENT STORE

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.986
THAT WE PASSED
ON THE WAY HERE.

01:20:17.029 --> 01:20:19.075
I DON'T THINK DECORATING
THE RAINBOW CHAPEL

01:20:19.118 --> 01:20:20.816
WITH A 99-CENT
PLASTIC BABY JESUS

01:20:20.859 --> 01:20:22.426
IS GONNA MAKE
A BIG ENOUGH SPLASH.

01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:26.212
DEAN IS A-- HE'S A FORCE.
HE'S A FORCE OF NATURE,

01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.824
AND I'VE BEEN REALLY
SPINELESS LATELY.

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:29.999
- AS YOU KNOW.
- MM.

01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:32.653
I GOTTA MAKE
A GRAND GESTURE.

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:34.786
MAYBE A SOUVENIR SHOP THEN.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.832
THE BEST WE'RE GONNA GET
IS A VELVET PAINTING OF JESUS

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:38.659
HOVERING OVER THE FALLS
IN THE MIST,

01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:41.749
OR A MOTHER MARY SNOW GLOBE,
OR BOTH ON A PEWTER PLATE.

01:20:41.793 --> 01:20:45.492
ALTHOUGH VERY COOL,
IT'S NOT THE REAL VIBE I'M LOOKING FOR.

01:20:47.494 --> 01:20:50.367
OKAY. HEY,
I THINK I FOUND AN ENTRANCE.

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:53.457
OKAY, OKAY.
STAY IN THE CAR.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.938
KEEP IT LOCKED.
WE'RE GOING IN.

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:03.249
THANKS, MAGGIE.

01:21:04.642 --> 01:21:05.773
SURE.

01:21:19.962 --> 01:21:23.052
LAST NIGHT OF FREEDOM!

01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:27.752
WHAT? NOT HOT ENOUGH?

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:30.189
IT'S YOUR BACHELOR PARTY.

01:21:30.233 --> 01:21:32.278
AREN'T YOU EXPECTED
TO INDULGE?

01:21:32.322 --> 01:21:35.064
THAT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

01:21:35.107 --> 01:21:38.894
PLEASE, HONEY,
THE GUY'S GOT HIS WIFE HERE.

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:42.898
- EX-WIFE.
- THAT HE FAILED TO TELL YOU ABOUT.

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:45.161
COME ON. ENJOY.

01:21:45.204 --> 01:21:48.077
THIS IS THE LAST FLING,
AND FROM WHAT I SAW,

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.383
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW.

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:57.869
YOUNG MAN, I OFFER YOU
A MEDICINAL TONIC--

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:01.525
A FAIR MAIDEN.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:22:01.568 --> 01:22:04.615
YES, A WOMAN TO EVEN OUT
THE PLAYING FIELD.

01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:07.139
JUST ONE SACRIFICIAL PLUNGE

01:22:07.183 --> 01:22:10.055
INTO THAT HOT
AND STEAMY VOLCANO

01:22:10.099 --> 01:22:13.493
WILL FREE YOU OF
YOUR PARTNER'S TRANSGRESSIONS.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:16.279
I INTRODUCE TO YOU...

01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:20.936
JUSTICE!

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.681
HI.

01:22:32.382 --> 01:22:34.558
YOU ARE SICK, DEMENTED,

01:22:34.601 --> 01:22:37.953
AND QUITE POSSIBLY FULL
OF EVERY STD IN THE BOOK,

01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:39.345
BUT YOU ARE A SOCIAL GENIUS,

01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:41.347
AND I AM PROUD
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

01:23:05.632 --> 01:23:07.852
WE GET A LOT
OF YOUR KIND UP HERE,

01:23:07.895 --> 01:23:10.376
HIPSTERS COMING IN
FROM BUFFALO,

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.031
FIGURING THEY CAN GRAB WHATEVER
THEY WANT FROM OUR HISTORY.

01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:17.601
THE BUILDINGS IN THIS CITY
AREN'T A FREE FOR ALL.

01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:20.386
YOU CAN'T TAKE STUFF
OUT OF BUILDINGS,

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.649
MUCH LESS CHURCHES.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:23:22.693 --> 01:23:25.739
OFFICER, HIS HUSBAND-TO-BE
IS A DEVOUT CATHOLIC.

01:23:30.831 --> 01:23:34.618
MAYBE YOU TWO CAN WORK ON
YOUR STORY A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:36.359
HEY, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
EH, FATHER?

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:38.796
LET'S SEE WHAT
THEY GOT HERE FROM YOU.

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:41.233
THEY GOT ONE...

01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:45.107
MAHOGANY CROSS.

01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:49.415
WE GOT A STATUE OF,

01:23:49.459 --> 01:23:53.419
UH, ST. PETER?

01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:56.640
OR IS IT MOSES?

01:23:56.683 --> 01:24:00.426
- IT'S ST. JOSEPH, RONALD.
- YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS JESUS?

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:03.429
THEY DO RESEMBLE EACH OTHER.
IT IS HIS FATHER.

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:05.431
OR IS THAT GOD?

01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:07.520
ARE YOU GOING TO
PRESS CHARGES OR NOT?

01:24:09.261 --> 01:24:11.524
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, MY SON.

01:24:11.568 --> 01:24:15.050
YOUR PARTNER CAME
TO THE CHURCH.

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.443
HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED
IN MY CHURCH WITH YOU.

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:19.358
HE WANTED ME TO PERFORM
THE WEDDING.

01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.447
I KNOW THAT YOU ONLY TRIED

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:25.234
TO TURN HIS DREAM
INTO A REALITY.

01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:28.019
I CANNOT APPROVE
OF YOUR WEDDING.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:31.979
I CERTAINLY CANNOT APPROVE
OF YOU STEALING FROM THE CHURCH,

01:24:32.023 --> 01:24:36.680
BUT I DO KNOW WHEN I WITNESS AN
ACT OF LOVE OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:39.161
AND GOD'S HAND
IS SURELY IN IT.

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.905
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS CROSS

01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:46.733
AND THE STATUE.

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:51.738
CONSIDER THEM WEDDING GIFTS.

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:56.134
AND GOD BLESS YOU, MY SON.

01:24:58.919 --> 01:25:01.574
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. OKAY.

01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:04.969
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:25:05.012 --> 01:25:06.492
I GOT THE WHOLE THING
WORKED OUT.

01:25:06.536 --> 01:25:09.104
I HAVE TALKED
TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY,

01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:13.108
AND I THINK WE CAN PLEAD
THIS DOWN TO A MISDEMEANOR.

01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:16.502
DOESN'T HURT THAT I'M THE
FORMER TRAFFIC COURT JUDGE.

01:25:16.546 --> 01:25:19.984
EASY THERE, CHIEF.
THE FATHER'S NOT PRESSING CHARGES.

01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:23.640
HE'S NOT--

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:26.686
HE'S NOT DOING
THE WEDDING, IS HE?

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.733
IT'S CENTERED. IT'S CENTERED.

01:25:29.776 --> 01:25:31.517
- IT LOOKS PERFECT.
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:33.302
IT REALLY-- ALL RIGHT.

01:25:33.345 --> 01:25:35.130
IT'S GOOD.
JUST LET ME DO IT.

01:25:37.349 --> 01:25:40.004
YEAH. THAT'S NICE. NICE.

01:25:46.358 --> 01:25:47.881
DARREN! DARREN!

01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.579
DARREN! DARREN,
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:52.973
NO, NO, NO, GO AWAY.
GO. DON'T LOOK.

01:25:53.017 --> 01:25:54.758
I WANT TO DO THIS FOR DEAN.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,

01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:56.107
PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM.

01:25:59.023 --> 01:26:03.158
- WHERE IS DEAN?
- IT'S MY FAULT.

01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:04.768
WE WERE WALKING
OVER THE BORDER,

01:26:04.811 --> 01:26:07.423
WALKING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE
TO THE UNITED STATES

01:26:07.466 --> 01:26:09.773
WHEN THIS SEXY BORDER AGENT
WAS REALLY--

01:26:09.816 --> 01:26:12.993
NO, NO, NO, YOU DID NOT START
FLIRTING WITH A BORDER GUARD.

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:14.995
YES! FORGIVE ME,
I HAVE A WEAKNESS.

01:26:15.039 --> 01:26:17.302
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
DOMINANT MEN IN UNIFORM.

01:26:17.346 --> 01:26:19.870
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH, DARREN.
DON'T JUDGE. IT'S A WEAKNESS.

01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:21.393
THERE'S NO END
TO YOUR WEAKNESSES.

01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:23.308
AND THEN WE WERE
IN THIS SCARY ROOM

01:26:23.352 --> 01:26:25.092
BEING INTERROGATED
BY HOMELAND SECURITY.

01:26:25.136 --> 01:26:27.834
- IT WASN'T HOMELAND SECURITY.
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

01:26:27.878 --> 01:26:31.795
OKAY, THERE WAS A MOMENT I SWEAR WE
WERE GONNA GET SENT TO GUANTANAMO BAY!

01:26:31.838 --> 01:26:34.145
AND I CAN'T HANDLE THAT,
NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.713
I NEED OPEN SPACES.

01:26:36.756 --> 01:26:38.584
OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENED, LONZIE?
WHAT DID YOU DO, LONZIE?

01:26:38.628 --> 01:26:40.630
OKAY, OKAY, DON'T JUDGE.

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:50.379
I ACCIDENTALLY TOLD THEM
ABOUT DEAN'S WORK VISA.

01:26:50.422 --> 01:26:52.032
- OH, MY GOD!
- STOP IT, LONZIE.

01:26:52.076 --> 01:26:53.425
THEY KNEW ABOUT DEAN'S VISA

01:26:53.469 --> 01:26:54.731
LONG BEFORE
YOU WERE INTERROGATED.

01:26:54.774 --> 01:26:57.212
OKAY, WHAT--
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

01:26:57.255 --> 01:26:59.214
IT MEANS THAT DEAN
IS STUCK IN CANADA.

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:01.825
HE'S AT SOME DETENTION CENTER
AT THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

01:27:01.868 --> 01:27:03.392
- THEY WON'T LET HIM THROUGH.
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

01:27:03.435 --> 01:27:04.654
BRADLEY STAYED BACK WITH HIM.

01:27:04.697 --> 01:27:07.222
OH, GOD,
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:10.442
I'M GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.
I'M GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.

01:27:10.486 --> 01:27:14.054
DO YOU HEAR ME?
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

01:27:14.098 --> 01:27:18.058
WELL, HE'S SO SORRY,
AND HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH, DARREN.

01:27:18.102 --> 01:27:20.278
SO MUCH. AND I SWEAR NOTHING
HAPPENED OVER THERE.

01:27:20.322 --> 01:27:22.062
- HE LOVES YOU, MAN.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:23.847
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING
HAPPENED OVER THERE.

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:25.240
BUT NOW
THAT YOU MENTION IT--

01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:27.546
OKAY. OKAY, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:29.635
THIS IS HOW IT'S GOTTA--
WOW, I'M GOOD.

01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:32.159
OOH, AM I GOOD. THIS IS HOW
IT'S GONNA WORK, RIGHT?

01:27:32.203 --> 01:27:34.249
DEAN CAN'T COME OVER HERE,

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:36.251
AND YOU CAN'T GET MARRIED
IN CANADA,

01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:41.691
BUT WHAT IF WE HAVE
THE WEDDING ON THE SIDEWALK

01:27:41.734 --> 01:27:43.432
OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE?

01:27:43.475 --> 01:27:45.651
RIGHT? DEAN WALKS OUT
INTO THE MIDDLE.

01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:48.088
DARREN AND HIS FAMILY
COME OUT IN THE MIDDLE

01:27:48.132 --> 01:27:51.091
IN INTERNATIONAL
AMBIGUOUS TERRITORY.

01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:55.052
I DO THE WEDDING VOWS.
I STAMP THE PAPERS.

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:58.273
AND VOILA,
DEAN IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

01:27:58.316 --> 01:27:59.578
IT CAN'T MISS.

01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:02.102
THAT SOUNDS INSANE.

01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:03.495
THANK YOU.

01:28:03.539 --> 01:28:05.062
BUT BRILLIANT.

01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.846
REALLY?

01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:09.458
- WILL IT WORK?
- MAYBE.

01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:10.937
MAYBE.

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:16.682
WE ARE SO DOING THIS!

01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:17.901
YEAH!

01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:21.861
COME ON, DARREN.

01:28:29.521 --> 01:28:31.306
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

01:28:31.349 --> 01:28:34.483
THEY THINK YOU'RE GETTING
MARRIED. SO DOES DARREN.

01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:37.747
MOM... IT'S OVER.

01:28:38.965 --> 01:28:40.750
WHO THE HELL ARE WE KIDDING?

01:28:43.535 --> 01:28:44.928
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT THE BEST PART

01:28:44.971 --> 01:28:46.886
ISN'T JUST A LITTLE BIT
DOWN THE ROAD?

01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:50.237
MOM, IT'S OVER.

01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:52.849
I GET IT.

01:28:52.892 --> 01:28:56.156
I HEAR THE UNIVERSE,

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.116
AND IT'S CLEARLY EXPANDING
WITHOUT DARREN AND I.

01:29:00.596 --> 01:29:04.295
- READ THE SIGNS.
- I HAVE READ THE SIGNS,

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.166
AND I KNOW
THAT DARREN LOVES YOU.

01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.385
AND I LOVE DARREN.

01:29:07.429 --> 01:29:10.170
AND IT'S A GODDAMN MESS.

01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:13.348
I GET IT. OKAY?

01:29:13.391 --> 01:29:15.567
BUT THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS.

01:29:15.611 --> 01:29:17.961
A TRAIN WRECK?

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:20.355
THANK YOU. THAT'S REALLY,
REALLY COMFORTING.

01:29:20.398 --> 01:29:22.531
YOU KNOW,
HE ALWAYS HAD TO BE PERFECT.

01:29:22.574 --> 01:29:25.360
HE HIRED A STYLIST FOR HIS
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION PICTURE.

01:29:25.403 --> 01:29:27.536
HE DESIGNED HIS OWN
BOUTONNIERE FOR THE PROM.

01:29:27.579 --> 01:29:29.842
REALLY?
CARNATIONS OR ORCHIDS?

01:29:29.886 --> 01:29:33.977
COLORED FEATHERS
WITH ROSE PETALS.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.371
IT WAS GORGEOUS.

01:29:36.414 --> 01:29:38.764
AND EVERY NIGHT BEFORE SCHOOL,
HE WOULD LAY OUT HIS CLOTHES,

01:29:38.808 --> 01:29:40.287
AND IF THEY DIDN'T MATCH,

01:29:40.331 --> 01:29:41.637
HE WOULD PLAY SICK
IN THE MORNING

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.160
AND NOT GO TO SCHOOL.

01:29:43.203 --> 01:29:46.381
WAIT, YOU--
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?

01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:48.731
YES, OF COURSE I DID.

01:29:48.774 --> 01:29:51.560
I ALLOWED IT.

01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:54.345
BUT LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS MATCH.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.173
IT CLASHES,

01:29:56.216 --> 01:29:58.784
AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST--
YOU HAVE TO TRUST.

01:29:58.828 --> 01:30:01.570
TRUST IN WHAT?

01:30:01.613 --> 01:30:05.443
IN MY FIANCEÉ
AND HIS NEWLY EX-WIFE,

01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:09.404
OR MY CHERNOBYL-THEMED WEDDING
THAT I CAN'T EVEN HAVE ANYMORE?

01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:13.625
YES. YES! IN ALL OF ITS
GLORIOUS UGLINESS, YES.

01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:19.022
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT.

01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:20.589
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED
BACK IN THE STATES

01:30:20.632 --> 01:30:22.417
FOR MONTHS, EVEN YEARS.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:25.420
WELL, THERE MAY BE A WAY.

01:30:27.073 --> 01:30:28.640
YOU JUST HAVE TO MEET HIM
IN THE MIDDLE.

01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:33.863
JUST THIS ONCE, WILL YOU
PLEASE TRUST IN THE CHAOS?

01:30:35.865 --> 01:30:38.824
COME ON. HERE.

01:30:38.868 --> 01:30:40.783
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL
IN THE MORNING.

01:30:49.487 --> 01:30:51.837
FOLKS,
THERE'S NO LOITERING ON THE BRIDGE.

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:53.404
PLEASE KEEP MOVING.
THANK YOU.

01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:08.071
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
HOW MUCH TIME DO I GOT?

01:31:09.159 --> 01:31:10.334
NO GUARDS.

01:31:10.377 --> 01:31:11.596
REALLY? REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE?

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.469
- ALL CLEAR.
- ROGER.

01:31:36.447 --> 01:31:39.668
PEDESTRIANS, KEEP MOVING.

01:31:39.711 --> 01:31:41.757
PLEASE CLEAR THE SIDEWALK.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.802
WHERE ARE MY EYES?

01:31:43.846 --> 01:31:45.500
I RAN OUT OF QUARTERS.

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:47.327
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE OUT OF QUARTERS?

01:31:47.371 --> 01:31:49.112
LOITERING ON THE BRIDGE

01:31:49.155 --> 01:31:51.723
IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
PLEASE KEEP MOVING.

01:32:00.993 --> 01:32:04.344
HOW ABOUT IT? AM I OKAY?
CAN I CONTINUE?

01:32:04.388 --> 01:32:06.564
- YOU'RE ALL CLEAR.
- ALL CLEAR.

01:32:06.608 --> 01:32:09.132
- TIN, IS THAT YOU?
- YES, I'M BACK.

01:32:09.175 --> 01:32:12.004
YOU'RE BACK!
OH, THANK GOD.

01:32:14.877 --> 01:32:18.054
ALL PEDESTRIANS
MUST KEEP WALKING ON THE BRIDGE.

01:32:18.097 --> 01:32:21.361
THERE'LL BE NO STOPPING,
NO CONGREGATING ON THE BRIDGE.

01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:42.948
I HOPE IT'S OKAY.
SHE AGREED TO BE MY BEST MAN.

01:32:42.992 --> 01:32:46.691
YOU WERE RIGHT.
I NEEDED TO HAVE A FRIEND HERE.

01:32:49.128 --> 01:32:51.304
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

01:32:51.348 --> 01:32:55.439
FOR THE JOINING
OF TWO WONDERFUL SOULS--

01:32:55.482 --> 01:32:57.876
DEAN AND DARREN.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:59.748
PEDESTRIANS,
KEEP MOVING ALONG THE WALK.

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.358
MAGGIE, DO YOU HAVE
THE RINGS READY?

01:33:01.401 --> 01:33:03.229
- YES.
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

01:33:03.273 --> 01:33:04.927
I THINK I'M GETTING
A LITTLE AHEAD OF MYSELF.

01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:06.972
- ALL RIGHT, JUST--
- GUARDS COMING FROM RIGHT.

01:33:07.016 --> 01:33:10.410
- GUARDS COMING FROM RIGHT.
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

01:33:10.454 --> 01:33:12.587
YOU KNOW, NIAGARA FALLS,
A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:13.979
DON'T KNOW THIS
ABOUT NIAGARA FALLS,

01:33:14.023 --> 01:33:16.765
BUT THERE'S OVER 3,000
TONS OF WATER

01:33:16.808 --> 01:33:19.115
THAT SPILL OVER THAT
EVERY SECOND. IT'S TRUE.

01:33:19.158 --> 01:33:22.118
HE STOPPED. TURNED AROUND.
HE TURNED AROUND.

01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:24.773

AHEM. OKAY, A FAST CEREMONY

01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:55.238
DOESN'T MEAN
A MEANINGLESS CEREMONY.

01:33:55.281 --> 01:33:59.459
SO, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS THING
A LONG TIME, RIGHT?

01:33:59.503 --> 01:34:01.244
