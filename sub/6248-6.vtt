<i># [Muzak]</i>

00:10.110 --> 00:13.307
- You like this song?
- Nobody likes this song.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.110
Well, you're dancing to it.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.151
Maybe swaying a little.
# [Hums]

00:19.219 --> 00:23.918
- And humming.
- Bones, it's just something
that you do in the elevator.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.959
Buddhists say that
if we can lose ourselves in the moment...

00:27.027 --> 00:31.327
without distraction or desire,
we experience truth.

00:31.398 --> 00:35.095
Why can't you just hum
like a normal, happy person?

00:35.168 --> 00:37.966
<i>[Police Radio Chatter]</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:39.767
Not really in the mood.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.569
Okay. Here we go.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.840
<i>Special Agent Booth.</i>

00:51.918 --> 00:53.852
And I'm gonna assume
this is Dr. Brennan?

00:53.920 --> 00:55.854
Bones, Alex Radziwill.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.083
He's, uh, from State Department.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.820
- <i>Why'd you say it like that?</i>
- Booth believes the State Department...

01:00.894 --> 01:03.886
was put on Earth
to protect bad guys from the F.B.I.

01:03.963 --> 01:07.126
- I count three dead?
- <i>[Radziwill] Four. There's one behind the bar.</i>

01:07.200 --> 01:08.792
Already I.D.'d as the bartender.

01:08.868 --> 01:11.098
This was a cocktail party
after a conference...

01:11.171 --> 01:13.105
on drug trafficking
in South America.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.040
The keynote speaker was
Colombian judicial attaché Dolores Ramos.

01:16.109 --> 01:20.341
- Did she survive?
- Minor burns, smoke inhalation. She'll be fine.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.938
- Luck of the draw.
- You seem uncomfortable.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.348
- Does his size make you self-conscious?
- <i>[Booth] Bones.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:30.185
It's a condition... skeletal dysplasia.
Pseudoachondroplasia or S.E.D. congenita?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.985
- Bones!
- What?

01:32.058 --> 01:34.117
Dr. Brennan, I can see
that you're a straightforward person.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.128
And as much as I appreciate
that quality...

01:36.196 --> 01:39.859
what you're asking me
is neither your business nor relevant.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.867
It's my business because
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.233
But you're right.
It's not relevant.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.204
<i>So what happened here? Bomb?</i>

01:46.272 --> 01:50.038
The blast came from the room next door.
Your people are working on the cause right now.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.544
I'm betting Colombian drug types.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.637
They just love blowing people up.

01:54.714 --> 01:57.706
Before she was attached to the embassy,
Dolores Ramos was a prosecutor in Bogotá.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.810
<i>She had plenty of enemies</i>
<i>in the cartels.</i>

02:00.887 --> 02:03.355
- You I.D. anyone else besides the bartender?
- Hector Madure.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.357
<i>Chief of police from Quito, Ecuador.</i>

02:05.425 --> 02:07.655
I brought you in
to confirm the identity of his wife.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.854
<i>She's the extra-crispy one.</i>

02:10.930 --> 02:13.660
<i>[Radziwill]</i>
<i>Father Gabriel Ruiz...</i>

02:13.733 --> 02:16.497
he ran a drug program
for kids in Bogotá.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.799
Well, you know, it's a big score
for the drug cartels.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.534
Any one of these people,
you know, make a good target.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.542
I'm gonna check on
the condition of the survivors.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.771
- You need anything, just holler.
- Will do.

02:27.347 --> 02:30.248
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>What do you got, Bones?</i>

02:30.316 --> 02:32.716
Female, mid-40s.

02:32.785 --> 02:37.916
Bone structure fits this picture
of Constanza Madure pretty closely.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.858
Dental work will confirm.

02:40.927 --> 02:45.762
The debris embedded in the remains
suggests an explosion.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.130
So does that giant hole
in the wall there.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.729
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Part of the navicular. Top of the left foot.</i>

02:52.805 --> 02:54.568
Not hers.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.439
<i>There are other bone shards</i>
<i>scattered here.</i>

02:57.510 --> 03:00.070
- Ooh. You mean, like, extra bits?
- Yes.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.239
These are fragmented from the blast.

03:04.050 --> 03:08.817
Ah, there's bone fragments
here in the wall.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.316
I think someone
was standing in this room...

03:13.393 --> 03:15.657
<i>very close to the bomb</i>
<i>when it went off.</i>

03:15.728 --> 03:18.219
It had to be the bomber, right?
Talk about instant karma.

03:18.298 --> 03:21.392
<i>The question is,</i>
<i>where are the rest ofhis remains?</i>

03:21.467 --> 03:23.298
<i>Vaporized maybe.</i>

03:23.369 --> 03:25.030
Unlikely.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.664
- Oh. Huh.
- What do you got?

03:27.740 --> 03:31.403
An external occipital protuberance.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.605
<i>Fissures indicate thermal detachment.</i>
<i>It's the back of a human skull.</i>

03:34.681 --> 03:37.844
Cam, any of your bodies
missing a protuberance?

03:37.917 --> 03:40.579
No. All of these remains
are fully intact.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.814
- <i>[Booth] Fully intact.</i>
- <i>[Saroyan] Uh-huh.</i>

03:45.058 --> 03:48.494
- Not all of them.
- <i>[Booth] Oh.</i>

04:25.898 --> 04:27.889
[Booth]
Arson investigators say that the explosion...

04:27.967 --> 04:31.027
definitely originated in the room
next to the cocktail party.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.972
- [Saroyan] Who was checked in there?
- Nobody. It was being renovated.

04:35.041 --> 04:38.636
Paint, combustibles... they would've
added to the force of the fire and explosion.

04:38.711 --> 04:42.078
So maybe the bomber
got caught by his own explosion.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.981
- <i>Her</i> own explosion.
- Wait. The bomber was a female?

04:45.051 --> 04:48.350
- Sciatic notch doesn't lie.
- Neither does the vagina.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.355
Whoa. Uh, wait a minute.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.357
Whoa. Wait a minute.

04:52.425 --> 04:55.223
You're saying this skull
was so hot that it explodes...

04:55.295 --> 04:57.559
but the girlie parts
are still intact?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.895
She was thrown into that chandelier
above the fire. The deep tissue remained intact.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.333
Thank you for that. I'll...

05:03.403 --> 05:05.098
Particulates embedded in
the remains are a combination...

05:05.171 --> 05:08.436
of glass, wood splinters,
plaster and drywall.

05:08.508 --> 05:13.707
The bomber is Caucasian, 5 feet 4,
late teens/ early 20s. Still no I.D.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.714
The hair sample makes her
a bleach-bottle blonde.

05:15.782 --> 05:19.081
<i>Ankylosis in the right trochlea</i>
<i>and capitulum and scaphoid.</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:21.677
Occupational markers
from carrying a tray.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.780
<i>Mad bomber-teenage assassin-waitress?</i>

05:24.857 --> 05:27.849
- She might not have had a choice.
- I don't understand.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.861
The cartels force people
to do what they want.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.397
Your waitress refuses,
the cartel wipes out her family.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.400
I'm running chemiluminescence tests now
to get a chemical fingerprint...

05:35.468 --> 05:39.370
and then chromatography
to see what triggered the blast.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.806
I scanned the skull
and reconstructed a face.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.208
<i>Send it over to Booth.</i>
<i>If drugs are involved, maybe she has a record.</i>

05:52.285 --> 05:54.947
- Yeah. I already did that.
- Listen, people, please.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.148
Don't be sending stuff
without informing me first.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.157
You wanted her to send it.
I heard you.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.716
But not without first...

06:01.794 --> 06:04.763
Just run everything
by me first, okay?

06:04.831 --> 06:08.665
Every circus needs a ringmaster.
In this circus, it's me.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.803
Yeah.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.805
All we ask
at the State Department...

06:13.873 --> 06:17.536
is that you treat this woman with the respect
she is due as a friend of this country.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.544
I know how to question the witness.

06:19.612 --> 06:22.080
I am here at the request
of the Colombian ambassador...

06:22.148 --> 06:24.241
Judge Ramos
and the State Department.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.251
Well, that's disingenuous.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.549
What are the chances
that all three would ask you separately?

06:28.621 --> 06:30.851
Why are you being
so confrontational?

06:30.923 --> 06:33.585
You're used to people deferring
to you because of your size.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.787
It's a normal response
that you take advantage of. I don't like it.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.797
- Here we go.
- See?

06:38.865 --> 06:41.265
Even you don't want
to say anything to hurt his tiny feelings.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.700
I don't mean
that your feelings are tiny.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.102
I mean that you have feelings
about being tiny.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.436
The ramifications and repercussions
of impeded access...

06:48.508 --> 06:51.375
will comprise accommodative
responses detrimental...

06:51.444 --> 06:55.813
to your unabated participation
in our shared endeavors.

06:55.882 --> 06:59.716
That's State Department-speak.
We don't do it his way, we'll get fired.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.687
See? If a regular-sized person
tried to intimidate you...

07:02.755 --> 07:04.689
you'd threaten to kick him
through the window.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.658
But because in his case it's
an actual physical possibility...

07:07.727 --> 07:09.558
Let's just question the judge.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.689
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.495
That was a nice moment...
me translating for you.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.267
[Woman] I was speaking
with Father Ruiz when the bomb went off.

07:20.339 --> 07:23.331
I believe his body
protected me from the blast.

07:23.409 --> 07:27.402
I was barely touched.
Father Ruiz was a very close friend of ours.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.414
Did you see this woman...

07:29.482 --> 07:32.508
at the hospitality suite
at the time of the explosion?

07:32.585 --> 07:34.382
- No.
- <i>[Brennan] You're sure?</i>

07:34.454 --> 07:36.888
She wasn't serving drinks,
anything like that?

07:36.956 --> 07:40.016
The service staff were all from the embassy.
Who is she?

07:40.092 --> 07:42.720
- She may have been the bomber.
- Mr. Radziwill.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.390
The State Department recognizes Judge Ramos
as a great friend to this country...

07:46.466 --> 07:49.867
and has charged me
with keeping her apprised of this investigation.

07:49.936 --> 07:54.373
Did you or anyone receive any threats
at the embassy before the conference?

07:54.440 --> 07:58.376
We are always receiving threats.
It's a fact of life for us.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.743
<i>The government provides</i>
<i>my wife and our family with bodyguards.</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:04.715
We have lost loved ones in the past.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.775
A daughter.
Eight years ago.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.684
Our condolences.

08:08.754 --> 08:11.848
<i>[Mr. Ramos] Do you believe this woman</i>
<i>to be connected to the cartels?</i>

08:11.924 --> 08:14.518
- We haven't identified her yet.
- Perhaps, Judge Ramos...

08:14.594 --> 08:16.619
your friends in Colombian law enforcement
could be of help.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.028
Yes, of course.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.089
Anything to aid the investigation.

08:21.167 --> 08:25.035
Thank you, Judge Ramos.
That's all for now.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.671
Hey, can you upload
the pictures from this camera?

08:27.740 --> 08:30.766
- Am I going to regret it?
- What kind of guy do you think I am?

08:30.843 --> 08:33.937
It's just that men sometimes
think things are funny...

08:34.013 --> 08:36.743
that women merely find gross.

08:36.816 --> 08:40.842
They're pictures of the hotel room.
I went there to collect some samples.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.217
- <i>[Computer Beeping]</i>
- Yeah. See?

08:43.289 --> 08:46.725
The heat blast deposited the first layer
of residue on the walls... hydrocarbons.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.760
- The first layer?
- Yep. Layer two...

08:48.828 --> 08:51.820
I had to use an electron capture detector
to <i>identify.</i>

08:51.898 --> 08:56.096
It was toluene and benzene... oxidized paint...
which just exploded from the cans.

08:56.168 --> 09:00.070
- The explosion was a two-parter?
- More accurately a fire, then an explosion.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.073
But get this.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.837
I found a patch of wall
with <i>only</i> oxidized paint on it.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.845
<i>Basically a shadow.</i>

09:06.913 --> 09:11.350
<i>Something was between the wall and the fire,</i>
<i>then was gone when the explosion occurred.</i>

09:11.417 --> 09:14.409
- Think you can figure out what it was?
- I can try.

09:14.487 --> 09:18.355
- Cool.
- [Exhales]

09:18.424 --> 09:21.655
I also found these blobs
of melted something.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.695
Yeah, not my department.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.527
You're just trying
to prolong this conversation.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.742
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.

09:38.811 --> 09:42.212
The explosion shifted the placement
of the teeth in the maxilla and mandible.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.341
I've repositioned them so that
we can match the dentals.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.114
The computer is looking now.

09:48.187 --> 09:50.519
Why do you suddenly
want to know everything?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.889
I think there's a tendency here
for each of us to work too independently.

09:53.960 --> 09:58.863
My closest acquaintance outside work
is a woman I know who's a performance artist.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.992
<i>Last month, she enclosed herself</i>
<i>in a plastic box with six rabbits.</i>

10:03.069 --> 10:06.470
It went over quite well.
Perhaps you've heard of her?

10:06.539 --> 10:09.997
Zack, when I said everything,
I meant just the case.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.742
- Lisa Winokur.
- Yep. Never heard of her.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.145
- Me neither.
- Isn't she the rabbit woman?

10:16.215 --> 10:19.412
No. Lisa Winokur's
the woman in the chandelier.

10:19.485 --> 10:23.717
Oh, good.
I'll let Booth know you I.D.'d the victim.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.247
- If you'd like to know anything else...
- I think I'm up to speed for now.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.556
But thanks.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.826
I saw about the explosion on the news.

10:32.898 --> 10:37.392
But Lisa wasn't supposed to be working
at the hotel last night.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.099
So I never thought
she'd be one of the casualties.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.607
How long had your daughter
been working there?

10:43.676 --> 10:46.509
Off and on, a couple of years.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.173
Waitressing when she needed money.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.546
<i>Tomorrow's her birthday.</i>

10:51.617 --> 10:54.518
I ordered the cake.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.578
<i>[Sobs]</i>

10:56.656 --> 10:59.648
I thought that she was
spending the night out with friends.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.886
That's why she didn't come home.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.862
She spend many nights
away from home?

11:04.930 --> 11:09.026
<i>My daughter was a very attractive young woman</i>
<i>living with her mother.</i>

11:09.101 --> 11:13.697
She had boyfriends,
and, yeah, sometimes she didn't come home.

11:13.773 --> 11:18.472
Did she have, uh...
um, anyone special in her life lately?

11:18.544 --> 11:22.605
Yeah, but I...
I never met him. I don't know his name.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.650
Is there anything
you can tell me about him?

11:24.717 --> 11:28.448
Oh. He was foreign.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.955
<i>Puerto Rican maybe?</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:33.321
She called him "Senor Hot Stuff."

11:33.392 --> 11:37.123
<i>Maybe that was a joke.</i>

11:37.196 --> 11:39.221
She said he was rich.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.661
Lisa was a really sweet girl.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.729
[Cries]

11:55.047 --> 11:58.073
The fire started approximately here.

11:58.150 --> 12:03.247
Which means that whatever cast
your reverse shadow was positioned here.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.621
- What cast the shadow?
- Well, I manipulated the images you gave...

12:06.692 --> 12:09.183
in order to figure out
the shape of the silhouette.

12:09.261 --> 12:13.425
The dark areas are where
there was both blowback residue from the fire...

12:13.499 --> 12:17.868
and the deposits of oxidized paint
left by the explosion.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.804
By going in as far
as individual pixels...

12:20.873 --> 12:24.809
<i>I was able to find the area</i>
<i>where there was only paint residue.</i>

12:24.877 --> 12:28.176
- That's a person.
- Yeah.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.545
Given the angles
and the distance from the wall...

12:30.616 --> 12:33.881
I'd say it's somebody
about six feet tall.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.116
And Lisa Winokur was only 5 foot 4.

12:37.189 --> 12:41.148
Which means whoever this was
got out before the actual explosion occurred.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.718
Oh, I could kiss you.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.323
That would require permission,
which I deny.

12:47.399 --> 12:50.459
I'll tell Booth that the bomber
is alive and is six feet tall.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.470
You'll tell who what?

12:52.538 --> 12:55.632
There's a loop, people,
and I'm in it.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.700
Not only am I in it,
I'm the big curvy part.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.872
<i># [R& B]</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:03.915
Lisa wasn't scheduled to work last night.

13:03.983 --> 13:07.646
She just came in on her own as a customer.
Picked up a guy.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.052
- You know anything about him?
- Looked Hispanic.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.489
- That's not P.C. to say, but you want details, right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.357
And it looked like he had money too.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.919
- How tall was he?
- I don't know.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.796
He was sitting when I saw him.

13:21.867 --> 13:27.430
Look, Lisa was a good kid.
But she used to scope the place for rich guys.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.565
- So she was a prostitute.
- <i>What?</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:32.577
No. No.
She was just like any of us.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.011
- Looking for a husband, right?
- [Chuckles]

13:36.549 --> 13:40.485
This guy last night...
she zoned in on him real hard.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.716
Took him upstairs,
you know, for privacy.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.280
- Upstairs where?
- The room that was being renovated.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.189
The... The one that caught on fire.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.253
I mean, it's against the rules,
but we've all done it.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.026
Right.
[Chuckles]

13:54.099 --> 13:57.694
<i>I mean, why else work</i>
<i>in a high-class place like this, right?</i>

13:57.770 --> 14:00.933
- Yeah.
- Someone's trying to flag you down.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.940
- Oh.
- Denise. Denise!

14:03.008 --> 14:04.976
Excuse me.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.512
Looks like it's possible that
Lisa went upstairs for a little...

14:07.580 --> 14:11.414
[Clicks Tongue]
quickie and, uh, wandered into a nightmare.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.577
She was trying to get you to go upstairs for a little...
[Whistles]

14:14.653 --> 14:17.554
Hey, that's the guy
that Lisa was with.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.853
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Yeah. He looks like he can be six feet tall.</i>

14:19.925 --> 14:22.985
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>What do you say we go pay him a little visit?</i>

14:26.498 --> 14:28.489
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

14:29.735 --> 14:32.431
Oh, well, lose your friend,
and maybe.

14:32.504 --> 14:35.962
It's about Lisa Winokur.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.139
[Clicks]

14:41.213 --> 14:44.307
Okay. It's cool, man.
It's all good.

14:49.421 --> 14:54.085
<i>My name is Antonio Ramos! Call the</i>
<i>Colombian embassy. I have diplomatic immunity.</i>

15:03.068 --> 15:05.263
<i>[Man On Radio]</i>
<i>Security, Sector 4 clear.</i>

15:05.337 --> 15:08.306
[Saroyan]
Musculature of the neck preserved the trachea.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.604
A swab shows no trace of carbon.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.167
So Lisa Winokur was not
breathing when the fire started.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.146
- I found semen.
- Where?

15:16.215 --> 15:20.618
- The usual place.
- No. I mean, no condom?

15:20.686 --> 15:22.711
Well, the sex may not
have been consensual.

15:22.788 --> 15:27.054
If she was already dead when the fire started,
what killed her?

15:27.126 --> 15:30.323
<i>Too much tissue damage for me.</i>
<i>Now it's time for the boneyard.</i>

15:31.630 --> 15:34.121
You, Zack. Do your thing.

15:34.199 --> 15:39.694
I'll have to ascertain if these fractures
were the result of heat, explosion or trauma.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.570
Which means I need to know
the exact nature of the explosion.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.836
How do you do that?

15:45.911 --> 15:47.970
The usual way.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.753
My embassy has been informed
of my whereabouts. I have nothing more to say.

15:54.820 --> 16:00.520
- Antonio Ramos.
- Any relationship to, uh, Judge Dolores Ramos?

16:00.592 --> 16:04.858
- She's my mother.
- This seriously calls genetics into question.

16:04.930 --> 16:08.559
You know,
your mother is a great woman.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.070
Have some water.
Why'd you run, Antonio?

16:12.137 --> 16:15.106
In my experience,
there are two reasons why people run.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.199
One, danger.

16:17.276 --> 16:20.006
- What's wrong with your arm?
- What?

16:20.079 --> 16:21.546
Your arm.
How did you hurt it?

16:21.613 --> 16:25.071
<i>The second reason people run</i>
<i>is they got something to hide. So...</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:27.277
<i>you got something to hide, Tony?</i>

16:27.353 --> 16:30.789
<i>Compound fracture.</i>
<i>Three or five pins in there.</i>

16:30.856 --> 16:33.051
Say, uh, six months old?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.922
Did you have sex
with her last night?

16:34.994 --> 16:38.452
[Chuckling] Is she what this is about?
Because it was her idea, not mine.

16:38.530 --> 16:42.933
- How well do you know her?
- Very well, and not so well,
if you know what I mean.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.061
- [Chuckles]
- I don't know what he means.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.765
It means he had sex with her
and forgot to learn her name.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.808
Well, you say that, not me.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.503
Well, it's not like you, uh,
exactly have a record...

16:52.578 --> 16:54.671
because you have, you know,
diplomatic immunity.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.908
More like a list of complaints.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.314
Let's see here.
Okay. Speeding...

16:59.385 --> 17:02.912
D.U.I., riding a motorcycle
on the mall...

17:02.988 --> 17:05.820
- <i>urinating on a national monument.</i>
- Good one.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.825
Substance abuse charges,
every one of them.

17:07.893 --> 17:11.124
My guess is you, uh,
got drunk and fell off a bicycle.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.460
It was a motorcycle.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.092
Agent Booth, you know Antonio Ramos
has diplomatic immunity...

17:16.167 --> 17:18.102
yet you insist on questioning him.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.262
Uh, diplomatic immunity doesn't
mean I can't question him.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.272
It means I can't throw him in jail.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.707
- Are you all right, Antonio?
- Mm-hmm.

17:24.777 --> 17:28.473
<i>Mr. Ramos, you're free to leave.</i>
<i>The F.B.I. will not bother you anymore.</i>

17:28.547 --> 17:31.448
- Can he promise that?
- No. Do you have any other higher aspirations...

17:31.517 --> 17:34.486
rather than just, you know,
babysitting drunken playboys?

17:34.553 --> 17:36.350
She's dead.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.257
- Who?
- Lisa.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.124
Lisa Winokur.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.688
- <i>That was her name.</i>
- How did she die?

17:47.766 --> 17:50.496
In the same explosion
that nearly killed your mother.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.595
- <i>[Booth] Did Lisa ever mention your parents?</i>
- Agent Booth.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.971
- She knew who they were.
- Antonio, answer no more questions.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.408
That's enough.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.346
[Exhales]

18:03.615 --> 18:06.311
You have something
to say to me, Dr. Brennan?

18:06.385 --> 18:10.219
Little people have a long history
of being close to power.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.781
As clowns and court jesters.
I see you've been to the art museum.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.351
Yes. But as clowns
and court jesters...

18:17.429 --> 18:21.331
they were the only ones allowed to mock the king,
to give him perspective.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.698
You don't do that, Mr. Radziwill.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.169
You just do what the king says...

18:26.238 --> 18:28.706
without putting anything
into perspective.

18:28.774 --> 18:32.039
Good thing I'm neither
a clown nor a court jester.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.045
Whoa... Don't do that.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.378
It's D.N.A. evidence.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.916
<i>The F.B.I. couldn't find any</i>
<i>evidence of an explosive charge.</i>

18:40.986 --> 18:43.682
- Then what blew up?
- <i>[Zack] There was liquor in the room.</i>

18:43.755 --> 18:46.349
Paint, turpentine.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.485
Paint, turpentine
and liquor blew down a wall...

18:49.561 --> 18:52.086
<i>torched four people</i>
<i>and deposited a corpse...</i>

18:52.164 --> 18:54.189
in a chandelier
12 feet off the ground.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.200
There was also
petroleum distillate...

18:56.268 --> 18:58.964
and six H.V.L.P. canisters
hidden under tarps.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.005
High volume, low pressure.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.200
So you can see where this is going.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.505
[Together]
No, we can't.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.511
A fire was set.

19:07.579 --> 19:11.606
The question is, given these ingredients,
would there be a secondary explosion?

19:11.683 --> 19:13.617
<i>I did the math very carefully.</i>

19:13.685 --> 19:15.619
This experiment
should generate an explosion...

19:15.687 --> 19:19.088
approximately 1/1000th
the magnitude of the explosion at the hotel.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.558
- Excuse me?
- 1/1000th.

19:21.627 --> 19:24.095
I think she meant
the explosion part, Zack.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.154
Relax. A little pop.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.098
This blast wall Zack built...
it's merely a precaution.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.898
We can watch through this porthole.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.098
Hey, I'm gonna wait outside.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.165
I hear that.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.475
Did they not hear me say
I did the math quite carefully?

19:45.551 --> 19:48.213
All right, I'll ignite the alcohol.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.484
The math says there will be
a 10-to-12-second gap...

19:51.557 --> 19:54.287
before the H.V.L.P. container explodes.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.951
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Fine. Ready?</i>

19:56.028 --> 19:58.997
Igniting the alcohol.

20:01.833 --> 20:05.325
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

20:05.404 --> 20:08.965
- [Loud Explosion]
- <i>[Zack, Hodgins Shouting]</i>

20:09.041 --> 20:10.975
- Man!
- Whoa! [Coughing]

20:11.043 --> 20:13.773
<i>[Electronic Beeping]</i>

20:13.845 --> 20:15.779
Are you all right?
Can you breathe?

20:15.847 --> 20:18.145
Hey, how many fingers
am I holding up?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.685
I'm okay.
I'm all right. Come on.

20:20.752 --> 20:24.153
- I don't understand what happened.
- You know what that proves?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.088
That you guys are idiots?

20:26.158 --> 20:29.252
That a blast that strong
wasn't necessarily a bomb.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.523
Most likely,
somebody killed Lisa Winokur...

20:31.597 --> 20:33.588
then started a fire
to cover up their crime.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.156
Without knowing
there would be a huge explosion.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.137
That's good, guys. Nice job.

20:40.205 --> 20:44.471
<i>Your theory of the crime is that Antonio Ramos</i>
<i>started a fire to cover up a rape and murder.</i>

20:44.543 --> 20:47.376
- D.N.A. matches the sperm found in Lisa Winokur.
- What do you want from me?

20:47.446 --> 20:51.007
Have the kid declared persona non grata
because of his previous offenses.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.313
- That gets rid of diplomatic immunity.
- And you can arrest him?

20:53.385 --> 20:55.319
- Exactly.
- Never gonna happen.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.117
Right. BecauseJudge Ramos
is such a good, good friend of this country.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.920
I don't think you can calculate
just how many American lives...

21:00.993 --> 21:04.019
she's saved by taking a hard line
on the cartels in Colombia.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.031
Obviously you have orders from the State
Department to have this whole diplomatic mess...

21:07.099 --> 21:09.397
booted out of the United States
and back into Colombia.

21:09.468 --> 21:14.064
Don't say anything.
Just, you know, if I'm right, just keep breathing.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.367
Bogotá, 1998.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.138
The Ramos family is leaving the city
for their country home.

21:20.212 --> 21:23.648
Their convoy is attacked.
End to a long, ugly story...

21:23.715 --> 21:27.481
<i>13-year-old Antonio is running away</i>
<i>from the fighting carrying his little sister.</i>

21:27.552 --> 21:31.579
Only trouble is, he has to keep going back
to pick up pieces of her brain.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.888
That's a sad story.
But it doesn't mean the guy can get drunk...

21:34.960 --> 21:36.928
and kill five people...

21:37.996 --> 21:39.930
including an American citizen.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.327
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Yeah?

21:46.405 --> 21:50.398
Booth, it's Cam.
We know how Lisa Winokur died.

21:52.177 --> 21:56.409
- She was strangled?
- The hyoid is cracked at the tips but not burned.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.006
Something was around her neck
when the fire got to her.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.382
Hodgins found burned fibers.
He's analyzing them now.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.944
<i>I also noticed</i> a broken finger.

22:04.022 --> 22:07.753
- I'm using those words especially for you, Booth.
- Thanks.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.795
<i>Also, disjunct</i>
<i>of acromion and coracoid...</i>

22:10.862 --> 22:13.353
with damage to the glenoid.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.593
- Dislocated shoulder.
- <i>[Saroyan] A typical injury...</i>

22:15.667 --> 22:19.535
of a victim on the ground straining
against someone strangling her from behind.

22:19.604 --> 22:24.234
[Brennan] There was a split in the cartilage
between the T3 and T4 vertebrae.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.300
Excuse me.
[Mutters]

22:26.378 --> 22:28.710
I thought that might be
from the fire or explosion.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.941
But why only those two vertebrae?

22:31.016 --> 22:34.474
You make a good point.
I'll take another look.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.949
Cam? Cam.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.925
Has anyone said anything
to you about, um...

22:41.993 --> 22:43.927
you know?

22:43.995 --> 22:47.453
- Us sleeping together?
- You gotta be way more careful
about blurting that out.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.659
Okay, voices, they carry,
building like this.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.669
There's no one around,
and you brought it up.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.298
Well, I mean, Angela is practically psychic
about this kind of stuff, right?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.865
So you can't be thinking about me
when, you know, she's around.

22:57.943 --> 22:59.877
- Especially not naked.
- I'll do my best.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.846
Onyx, peridot and Peruvian opal.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.975
Probably jewelry.
It's an unusual combination. Very expensive.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.485
Yeah, well, Lisa Winokur...
I mean, she was a waitress.

23:11.556 --> 23:15.151
You know, I highly doubt that her tips
would be able to cover expensive jewelry.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.957
<i>Well, a waitress that's having sex</i>
<i>with a Colombian princeling...</i>

23:18.029 --> 23:20.554
I mean, you don't buy expensive jewelry
for a one-night stand.

23:20.632 --> 23:23.032
And maybe Antonio was lying
about not knowing Lisa.

23:23.101 --> 23:25.035
- Well, exactly.
- Yeah.

23:27.038 --> 23:30.633
Angela found a jeweler named Lawrence Melvoy
who works in this stuff.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.233
- Okay.
- I'll start...

23:32.310 --> 23:33.834
- All right, great.
- Yeah.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.577
- Take that?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.354
Oh, my God.
What happened?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.224
- <i>[Booth] Is this jewelry yours?</i>
- Definitely.

23:50.295 --> 23:54.629
- Are these pieces expensive?
- This piece was worth 8,000.

23:54.699 --> 23:57.930
- Dollars?
- My work is all original.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.699
This one went to a young woman.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.502
Cheap shoes,
expensive watch, you know?

24:03.575 --> 24:05.543
No. I'm sorry.
I don't know.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.706
<i>That combination means that someone else</i>
<i>purchased this piece for the young woman.</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:12.875
Could, uh, this be the woman?

24:12.951 --> 24:14.885
- <i>That's her.</i>
- Yeah.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.887
I need to know who made
the actual purchase.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.220
- I don't know the buyer.
- You know how it was paid?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.351
I have a bank routing number.

24:22.427 --> 24:24.486
Oh. That'll do.

24:32.604 --> 24:35.038
Hey, I've had a realization.

24:35.106 --> 24:37.404
Oh, I've never seen you
on the computer before.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.809
I'm, uh, just trying
to find out who bought...

24:40.879 --> 24:43.905
Lisa Winokur expensive jewelry.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.246
What? Me being on the computer...
is that what, your realization?

24:46.318 --> 24:50.618
No. Antonio Ramos could not have been
Lisa Winokur's attacker.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.453
Why couldn't our prime suspect
have committed the murder?

24:53.525 --> 24:56.585
- Antonio's arm has pins in it.
- Pins?

24:56.661 --> 24:58.925
Yeah. So he's maybe 30%
of his normal strength.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.727
No way that's enough to
dislocate our victim's shoulder.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.098
- <i>So how?</i>
- How what?

25:04.169 --> 25:07.195
Well, how can you find
the jewelry thing on the computer?

25:07.272 --> 25:09.206
I have a bank routing number
that dead-ends...

25:09.274 --> 25:12.175
at an offshore corporate account
belonging to a shell corporation...

25:12.244 --> 25:14.610
in the Netherlands Antilles.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.806
- Isn't that impossible to trace?
- <i>Well, no.</i>

25:16.882 --> 25:20.784
Since 9/11, all foreign wires
have to register an individual's name...

25:20.852 --> 25:22.786
with the State Department.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.789
So I simply...

25:25.857 --> 25:28.690
access the State Department database.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.093
- <i>Aw, hell.</i>
- <i>[Brennan] What?</i>

25:37.168 --> 25:40.262
That little bastard
is protecting someone.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.972
<i>[Radziwill] If the computer</i>
<i>says confidential, then it's confidential.</i>

25:50.048 --> 25:52.346
I find it best not to argue
with computers.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.476
Were you the one
who authorized the block...

25:54.553 --> 25:57.545
or did it come from
higher up on the food chain?

25:57.622 --> 25:59.954
Go through channels.
Make a request.

26:00.025 --> 26:03.153
- Go to hell, Alex.
- Why are you being so mean?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.856
'Cause "go through channels"
is diplomatic double-talk for "get lost."

26:05.931 --> 26:08.263
- Can I talk to him?
- Hello? Dr. Brennan?

26:08.333 --> 26:11.359
<i>I'm just small, not invisible.</i>

26:11.436 --> 26:13.927
Under what circumstances,
in general...

26:14.005 --> 26:16.132
- <i>would the State Department</i>
<i>block a name like this?</i>
- [Sighs]

26:16.207 --> 26:18.141
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Come on, Alex.</i>

26:18.209 --> 26:20.473
Hey, don't be one of them.
Go on a limb, huh?

26:26.885 --> 26:31.481
Fine. Might be an intelligence asset
or someone under investigation.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.490
It could be a request
from Homeland Security.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.492
They just do
whatever the hell they want.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.391
<i>Could be a C.I.A. shell company...</i>

26:37.462 --> 26:39.896
masquerading as a bad guy,
or a bad guy who's been compromised.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.830
The I.R.S. could be working
offshore shelters.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.390
- It could be someone...
- <i>[Booth] Ha!</i>

26:43.468 --> 26:45.629
- Ha!
- He didn't say anything.

26:45.704 --> 26:49.140
He was about to say
"diplomatic immunity."

26:49.207 --> 26:53.007
Let's say the boy bought the girl some jewelry.
That doesn't mean he killed her.

26:53.078 --> 26:57.708
It means he was lying when he said
he met her for the first time that night.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.183
Come on, Alex. This isn't evidence for court.
I'm just collecting names.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.415
- Please. Like that's gonna work on me.
- [Sniffs]

27:05.890 --> 27:08.415
Whoever killed Lisa Winokur
is responsible...

27:08.493 --> 27:11.485
for the deaths of four other people,
including a priest.

27:11.563 --> 27:14.225
Doesn't the State Department
have to assure those families...

27:14.299 --> 27:16.927
they're doing everything they can
to apprehend the responsible party?

27:17.002 --> 27:19.266
- Are you threatening the State Department?
- No.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.736
- Yes.
- What?

27:20.805 --> 27:23.069
- <i>That's a great idea.</i>
- What's a great idea?

27:23.141 --> 27:26.872
- The F.B.I. blackmailing the State Department.
- He has diplomatic immunity.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.879
There's nothing you can do.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.415
Come on, Alex.
Baby steps.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.782
- No offense.
- <i>[Brennan Chuckles]</i>

27:36.855 --> 27:38.789
I just got that. It's baby steps...

27:38.857 --> 27:43.419
<i>because you're so small.</i>

27:43.495 --> 27:45.759
It's probably offensive.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.027
Sorry. I can't help you.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.034
Sorry.

27:55.874 --> 27:57.808
[Sighs]

27:57.876 --> 28:01.937
Brought you some coffee.
It's late.

28:02.013 --> 28:05.915
You said you found burned silk fibers
on Lisa Winokur's throat, right?

28:05.984 --> 28:09.385
Yeah. The good stuff too.
Unwound filament. Probably Chinese.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.981
None of this carded, combed or spun stuff.
And definitely not nubbly.

28:14.559 --> 28:18.222
- What?
- You are a man of odd enthusiasms.

28:18.296 --> 28:21.732
I'm checking for silk neckties
on the men at the party.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.995
- <i>[Computer Beeping]</i>
- Look at this.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.566
<i>That's Antonio</i>
<i>two hours before the explosion.</i>

28:28.640 --> 28:30.574
All the evidence points towards him.

28:30.642 --> 28:34.373
But Brennan says with his bad arm,
there's no way he could've killed Lisa Winokur.

28:36.915 --> 28:38.849
I... I know something.

28:38.917 --> 28:42.512
And when you know it,
you should know that I know.

28:42.587 --> 28:47.183
But I don't feel we can discuss it until you,
you know, know it independently from me.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.795
Are you sniffing my hair?

28:51.863 --> 28:54.331
You called it, baby.
Man of odd enthusiasms.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.962
Lisa Winokur's finger is broken.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.702
<i>Zackaroni, almost every bone</i>
<i>in her body was broken.</i>

29:04.776 --> 29:07.506
This break was professionally set.

29:07.579 --> 29:12.039
It had started healing,
I'd say around two weeks ago.

29:12.117 --> 29:15.917
And before I cleaned the bones,
I noticed this metallic sheen.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.818
I thought it was a cheap ring,
but it's aluminum.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.985
- I think it was a splint.
- Do you draw a conclusion from that?

29:23.061 --> 29:26.155
I don't really do that,
which is why I called you.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.831
<i>I don't see how</i>
<i>health insurance forms can help you.</i>

29:28.900 --> 29:31.164
Yeah, I'm gonna have these
photocopied, okay?

29:31.236 --> 29:33.204
Sure.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.174
[Clears Throat]

29:54.993 --> 29:57.052
Anthropologically speaking...

29:57.128 --> 30:00.859
a man gives a woman a gift
as a way of laying claim.

30:00.932 --> 30:04.698
As a way of marking her as his...

30:04.769 --> 30:06.896
to the other males in the community.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.372
All I know is,
he gave her nice things.

30:10.441 --> 30:14.207
And when he started talking
about breaking it off, we were both surprised.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.941
They were breaking up?

30:17.015 --> 30:20.178
I told her not to give up that easy.

30:20.251 --> 30:23.152
I told her that
when it comes down to it...

30:23.221 --> 30:27.180
a man like this,
who's rich and sophisticated...

30:27.258 --> 30:30.125
he'll do the right thing by you.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.358
You advised your daughter
to get pregnant?

30:33.431 --> 30:35.365
<i>It sounds bad.</i>

30:35.433 --> 30:39.870
But there was no reason
for Lisa to live the life I led.

30:43.908 --> 30:47.503
Please tell me my daughter wasn't murdered
because I told her to get pregnant.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.013
[Sobs]

30:53.184 --> 30:54.981
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

30:55.053 --> 30:57.146
Bones, can I talk to you
for a moment?

30:57.222 --> 30:59.850
Uh...

30:59.924 --> 31:01.983
Excuse me.

31:06.664 --> 31:09.155
- What did you do to her?
- I don't know.

31:09.234 --> 31:11.168
- Hospital admission forms.
- Yeah? What about 'em?

31:11.236 --> 31:14.899
Look at the signature of the person
who dropped Lisa off at the emergency room.

31:14.973 --> 31:18.101
"Juan Vasco Ramos."
That's Antonio's father.

31:18.176 --> 31:21.509
Lisa was having an affair
with the judge's husband, not her son.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.013
- And he was leaving her.
- How do you know that?

31:24.082 --> 31:26.778
She advised her daughter
to get pregnant...

31:26.851 --> 31:29.115
when it looked likeJuan Ramos
was about to dump her.

31:29.187 --> 31:32.782
Yeah, Lisa sees the boy drunk,
decides to seduce him.

31:32.857 --> 31:36.020
Has unprotected sex
in an effort to get pregnant.

31:36.094 --> 31:40.190
Dad finds out, and suddenly
the troublesome girlfriend is worth killing.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.534
She's worried that her advice
got her daughter killed.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.535
Yeah, she's probably right.
I tell you what.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.663
I'm gonna call Radziwill and have him
bring Dad in for questioning.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.800
Oh, you know what?
I should leave you alone more often.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.553
- Good morning.
- Where's Juan Ramos?

32:02.620 --> 32:05.054
He declined your invitation.
He decided to go back home to Colombia.

32:05.123 --> 32:08.183
- What airline?
- Why? You can't do anything anyway.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.159
Well, he killed five people!

32:10.228 --> 32:13.220
Yes, yes.
Let's not go through the mortality list again.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.232
I need to know what airline.

32:17.201 --> 32:19.396
Private jet out of
Kent Island Airport.

32:21.906 --> 32:25.137
<i>Even if we get there on time,</i>
<i>how are we gonna stop them from taking off?</i>

32:25.209 --> 32:27.177
All right, call Hodgins.

32:27.245 --> 32:29.873
What can Hodgins do?
I mean, this isn't about evidence.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.540
Just give him a call.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.584
<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

32:33.651 --> 32:35.585
Bugs, slime, particulates.

32:35.653 --> 32:39.419
Hodgins, just listen.
Don't say anything. Just do as I ask.

32:40.758 --> 32:43.318
- You there?
- You told me not to say anything.

32:43.394 --> 32:46.227
Look. Okay, listen to me.
I need you in your craziest...

32:46.297 --> 32:48.925
most paranoid conspiracy mode...

32:49.000 --> 32:52.299
to call the F.A.A. and tell them
that a private flight to Bogotá...

32:52.370 --> 32:55.271
is about to leave
Kent Island Private Airport...

32:55.340 --> 32:58.673
and is carrying aliens
or-or terrorists, or, you know...

32:58.743 --> 33:01.007
You know what to do.
Now, do you got any questions?

33:01.079 --> 33:03.604
Just one.
Full court press...

33:03.681 --> 33:05.774
no holds barred, maximum effort?

33:05.850 --> 33:07.545
Just stop the plane from taking off.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.449
[Beeps]

33:10.922 --> 33:14.289
- [Man] F.B. I!
- [Man #2] Everybody out of the plane!

33:14.359 --> 33:17.294
<i>[Tires Screeching, Siren Wailing]</i>

33:17.362 --> 33:21.162
<i>What will happen to Hodgins</i>
<i>if the State Department finds out?</i>

33:21.232 --> 33:23.700
Know what?
Better they don't find out.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.508
The F.A.A. got a call
saying Judge Ramos's plane...

33:36.581 --> 33:39.106
had been targeted by
the National Liberation Army...

33:39.183 --> 33:41.310
a terrorist organization
in Colombia.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.320
And you took it seriously?

33:43.388 --> 33:45.618
Caller used
a highly classified code phrase...

33:45.690 --> 33:48.124
- <i>which established the threat as authentic.</i>
- Really?

33:48.192 --> 33:51.491
A highly classified code phrase
known only to a gold-plated asset...

33:51.562 --> 33:54.929
<i>inside the terrorist organization.</i>

33:54.999 --> 33:58.901
If it weren't, I might suspect you had
something to do with it.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.234
Booth, you seem to have trouble
accepting that there is...

34:01.305 --> 34:04.172
absolutely nothing you can do
in these circumstances.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.710
Well, Juan Ramos just,
you know, flying out of here.

34:06.778 --> 34:10.270
This whole diplomatic immunity thing.
The whole thing just stinks.

34:10.348 --> 34:13.146
You should think
it stinks too, Mr. Radziwill.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.708
Put together your evidence package.
Submit it to State.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.880
We'll present it to
the Colombian authorities.

34:17.955 --> 34:20.514
Let them decide whether
or not to levy charges.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.252
Wait, wait.
That's our only option?

34:22.326 --> 34:24.260
Hope that a foreign government
will lay charges...

34:24.328 --> 34:26.262
based on a forensics-heavy investigation...

34:26.330 --> 34:28.661
done by American law enforcement
on another continent?

34:28.733 --> 34:31.201
Unless you can persuade him
to give up diplomatic immunity...

34:31.268 --> 34:33.362
yes, it's our only option.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.770
- How long have we got to do that?
- <i>About as long...</i>

34:35.840 --> 34:38.831
as it takes to take apart a plane
and put it back together again.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.605
<i>Maybe 24 hours.</i>

34:40.678 --> 34:43.909
<i>You're the one who said you have to</i>
<i>be kept up to date on everything.</i>

34:43.981 --> 34:47.542
When I said everything, I might have been
a bit too... You tend to be very literal.

34:47.618 --> 34:50.178
Thermal dislocation
can be extremely deceptive.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.417
Typically heat causes
short bones to move at the ends.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.721
These were split in the middle.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.784
What?

34:59.063 --> 35:01.827
- Brennan!
- Whoa. What'd I do?

35:01.899 --> 35:04.026
T3 and T4 are behind the lungs.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.036
This is why we have to
communicate more because...

35:06.104 --> 35:08.572
I have a cell phone, Dr. Saroyan.

35:08.639 --> 35:12.336
I found evidence of a perforation
in the membrane of her lungs.

35:12.410 --> 35:15.846
That could be connected to
the T3 and T4 vertebrae damage.

35:15.913 --> 35:19.576
Exactly what I thought. Could it have been
pierced by a rib during the attack?

35:19.650 --> 35:22.016
The ribs were not broken pre-explosion.

35:22.086 --> 35:26.386
The vertebrae were pushed apart
so they'd slide across the lung surface.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.391
That would cause a tear.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.393
No. This is definitely a puncture.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.021
Whatever pierced the membrane
was forced through the vertebrae.

35:33.097 --> 35:35.065
- A knife?
- Zack?

35:35.133 --> 35:38.000
No cuts on the bone.
Something softer than a blade.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.196
To reach the lung from the back...

35:40.271 --> 35:44.207
means moving through the epidermis,
dermis, hypodermis, subcutaneous fat...

35:44.275 --> 35:47.369
and three layers of thoracic muscle fiber
and connective tissue.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.504
Not to mention
splitting those vertebrae.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.844
That requires
a great deal of pressure...

35:51.916 --> 35:54.680
suggesting the force
of a leg, not an arm.

35:54.752 --> 35:59.348
It's as though Juan Ramos drove something
into Lisa Winokur's back with his foot.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.857
Mmm. Like a golf tee?

36:01.926 --> 36:03.689
<i>[Booth] A golf tee?</i>

36:03.761 --> 36:06.286
- That makes no sense.
- I'm not sure what we're looking for.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.298
A sharp implement.

36:08.366 --> 36:12.302
- He has a pen in his pocket.
- <i>[Booth] Wait. How would he force a pen...</i>

36:12.370 --> 36:15.100
through her back with his foot?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.403
Judge Ramos is 5 foot 9?

36:17.475 --> 36:19.375
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:19.443 --> 36:22.537
- Why is she the same height as her husband?
- [Beeping]

36:22.613 --> 36:25.047
<i>Three-inch stiletto heels.</i>

36:25.116 --> 36:29.052
We assumed the killer
was six feet tall and a he.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.318
But what if it was a 5-foot-9 woman
wearing three-inch heels?

36:33.391 --> 36:36.554
I mean, could Judge Ramos
have driven her heel...

36:36.627 --> 36:39.790
- [Bones Snap]
- <i>into Lisa Winokur's back as she strangled her?</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:41.991
The judge finds out that
the waitress is having sex...

36:42.066 --> 36:44.591
<i>with both her husband and her son,</i>
<i>trying to get pregnant.</i>

36:44.669 --> 36:46.603
- That's motive for murder.
- Also...

36:46.671 --> 36:50.767
before the fire,
she has a beautiful silk wrap on.

36:50.841 --> 36:53.469
Afterwards, it's gone.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.479
That's what she used
to strangle Lisa Winokur.

36:56.547 --> 37:00.449
Great. It was Judge Ramos.
She did it. Very compelling evidence.

37:00.518 --> 37:02.452
Excellent. But you know what?

37:02.520 --> 37:05.421
- Too bad. It's useless.
- Unless...

37:05.489 --> 37:09.118
<i>we can find a way to make</i>
<i>Judge Ramos waive her diplomatic immunity.</i>

37:09.193 --> 37:11.127
How are we gonna do that?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.165
Go grab a cup of coffee.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.363
- I'll figure it out.
- Get some pie, Bones? Let's get some pie.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.303
Pie? Why are we having pie?

37:22.373 --> 37:25.831
Cherry pie.
Not too tart, not too sweet.

37:27.778 --> 37:31.305
Oh, yeah, baby.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.542
Wow.

37:32.617 --> 37:36.951
Hey, love is in
the purified and ionized lab air.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.955
Why should we resist?

37:39.023 --> 37:42.151
Go.

37:42.360 --> 37:46.558
A woman likeJudge Ramos, who stood up
to drug cartels, who always did the right thing...

37:46.631 --> 37:50.123
it's hard to imagine
her killing another human being.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.829
Bones, she's a strong woman.
That's why she stood up to the cartels...

37:52.903 --> 37:55.064
and lived on after
her daughter was killed.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.164
Hey, look, her point of view...

37:57.241 --> 37:59.175
Lisa Winokur was
threatening her family.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.177
So she snapped.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.213
Will she get away with it?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.374
Yeah.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.815
I think she will.

38:07.885 --> 38:10.285
Okay. We all got together...

38:10.354 --> 38:13.585
Well, Zack wouldn't help until I threatened him.
But the rest of us...

38:14.992 --> 38:16.926
The blowback pattern shows...

38:16.994 --> 38:19.394
that Lisa Winokur's killer
was six feet tall.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.023
Antonio Ramos is six feet tall.

38:22.099 --> 38:25.227
Lisa Winokur had sex
immediately before her demise.

38:25.303 --> 38:29.000
D.N.A. tests show
it was with Antonio Ramos.

38:29.073 --> 38:32.372
Lisa Winokur was strangled
with a silk ligature.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.741
Antonio Ramos favors silk ties.

38:34.812 --> 38:38.714
Why are you manipulating the facts
to make it sound like Antonio was the killer?

38:38.783 --> 38:41.946
No, it's okay, Bones.
Let her... Let her continue.

38:42.019 --> 38:45.352
<i>Because ofhis broken arm,</i>
<i>Antonio Ramos was forced...</i>

38:45.423 --> 38:47.721
to place his foot
on Lisa Winokur's back...

38:47.792 --> 38:50.022
damaging her vertebrae.

38:50.094 --> 38:54.360
You are fabricating a scenario by misrepresenting
the evidence and omitting key facts.

38:54.432 --> 38:56.525
It's a bluff.
Cops do it all the time.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.534
So you think if we frame Antonio...

38:58.602 --> 39:03.301
Judge Ramos will confess
to save her own son.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.706
What mother wouldn't?

39:05.776 --> 39:08.904
- Bones?
- No. No.

39:08.979 --> 39:12.039
It's no different than lying
to a criminal to get a confession.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.641
Or having Hodgins call the F.A.A.
with a fake terrorism tip.

39:14.719 --> 39:18.712
- He did what?
- Oh, what? Now suddenly there's a line here?

39:18.789 --> 39:20.916
- You can't allow this.
- I'm a hundred percent against it.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.255
Seeley, you hate
diplomatic immunity.

39:23.327 --> 39:25.352
I'm against it when it's interfering
with my murder investigation...

39:25.429 --> 39:27.260
but the world's bigger than that.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.094
What are you talking about?

39:29.166 --> 39:32.101
We cheat diplomatic immunity here in D.C.,
we catch a murderer.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.262
That's great.
They do it in "Upper Kamikazestan"...

39:34.338 --> 39:38.069
and our boys end up
on a red-hot spit over a slow fire.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.508
There's no such place
as "Kamikazestan."

39:40.578 --> 39:42.739
Okay. Bottom line is,
we ignore diplomatic immunity...

39:42.813 --> 39:46.010
and the rest of the world finds out,
it's open season on Americans.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.746
So you know what?
Thanks for the effort and the fake file.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.584
But let's just remember, all right?

39:52.656 --> 39:56.786
We're the good guys.
Oh, I'm gonna need that real evidence file too.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.795
Okay.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.000
- Even if this were true...
- It's true.

40:07.071 --> 40:10.507
- My family and I have diplomatic immunity.
- That's politics.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.236
A woman like you...
a judge, a prosecutor...

40:13.310 --> 40:16.370
who's given up
their whole life for justice...

40:16.447 --> 40:20.884
You can't live
for what you did to Lisa Winokur.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.814
- What next?
- The F.B.I. formally hands this evidence over to me.

40:28.893 --> 40:33.353
<i>I present it to the ambassador.</i>
<i>He presents it to the attorney general of Colombia.</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:36.992
And the State Department gets what it wants,
what you've been working for all along.

40:37.067 --> 40:40.867
- This mess in another country.
- All parties played by the rules. That's diplomacy.

40:45.776 --> 40:49.803
Still, speaking outside of my role
as a member of the State Department...

40:49.880 --> 40:52.542
the attorney general of Colombia
is not a friend to you.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.914
No, he is not.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.078
<i>[Radziwill]</i>
<i>This evidence is political ammunition.</i>

40:57.154 --> 41:00.487
I mean, there'll almost
certainly be a trial...

41:00.558 --> 41:02.924
and he would certainly want you in jail,
which would mean...

41:02.993 --> 41:05.553
The cartels have been
trying to kill me for years.

41:05.629 --> 41:09.030
In prison, they would
succeed on the first day.

41:09.099 --> 41:12.557
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>They would torture and kill you.</i>

41:12.636 --> 41:15.605
<i>Might I make a suggestion?</i>

41:15.673 --> 41:17.607
Waive your diplomatic immunity...

41:17.675 --> 41:21.543
and be tried fairly
here in the United States.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.621
What's it gonna be, Judge?

41:33.691 --> 41:37.525
<i>I turn this evidence over</i>
<i>to an American prosecutor...</i>

41:37.595 --> 41:40.086
or to Mr. Radziwill?

41:44.034 --> 41:46.264
[Judge Ramos]
I waive diplomatic immunity.

42:00.618 --> 42:03.416
[No Audible Dialogue]

42:03.487 --> 42:06.479
<i>[Chattering]</i>

42:06.557 --> 42:09.321
Well, look at 'em down there, huh?

42:09.393 --> 42:13.056
Heh! Probably falsifying evidence.

42:13.130 --> 42:17.726
I'm not sure I can totally trust
Dr. Saroyan after that.

42:17.801 --> 42:22.067
You know, Bones,
Cam's a cop at heart.

42:22.139 --> 42:25.734
She, uh... She just wants
to catch the bad guys.

42:26.911 --> 42:28.845
There are a lot of gray areas.

42:28.913 --> 42:32.405
Not for you.
You did the right thing.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.748
Yeah. It worked out is all.

42:35.819 --> 42:38.287
You did the right thing.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.853
[Chattering]

42:43.928 --> 42:45.418
Uh-oh.

42:47.264 --> 42:49.926
[Man]
Sir?

42:50.000 --> 42:53.629
- Well, shouldn't we do something?
- [Scoffs] Are you kidding?

42:53.704 --> 42:58.403
<i>Hodgins being abducted</i>
<i>by men in black?</i>

42:58.475 --> 43:01.103
That's a dream come true.

43:47.658 --> 43:49.057
What's that mean?
