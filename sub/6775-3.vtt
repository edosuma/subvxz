YOU GOTTA GET IN THERE,
REALLY SCRUB IT,

02:54.130 --> 02:56.257
HOSE IT DOWN
EVERY NIGHT.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.228
KEEP THE BUGS OUT.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.198
'CAUSE SOMEONE
FOUND A ROACH

03:00.200 --> 03:02.521
IN A LOAF OF
WHOLE WHEAT ONCE
AND SUED.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.498
CAN'T YOU JUST
SPRAY IT WITH RAID ?

03:04.500 --> 03:07.594
AND THEN YOU GOT
BUG POISON IN BREAD,
KILL A HUNDRED PEOPLE.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.658
IS THAT GOOD ?

03:16.730 --> 03:17.958
OH, JESUS.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.322
I GO'I'I'A GET TO
MY CHIROPRACTOR.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.491
HEY, YOU THINK ANYONE'S
EVER HAD SEX IN HERE ?

03:31.830 --> 03:34.526
WHY THE FUCK WOULD
YOU EVEN THINK THAT ?

03:34.530 --> 03:35.519
HUH ?

03:38.560 --> 03:40.391
AHH... !

03:40.400 --> 03:42.755

03:47.900 --> 03:49.595

03:51.230 --> 03:51.924
ROMANO ?

03:55.930 --> 03:57.329
ROMANO ?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.521
ROMANO,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

04:17.300 --> 04:21.020
( big band music on radio )

04:22.660 --> 04:30.624
( male and female
giggling )

04:32.400 --> 04:34.595
THAT WAS...

04:34.600 --> 04:37.455
YOU MADE
THE WEIRDEST NOISE
BACK THERE.

04:37.460 --> 04:38.893
IF I WERE YOU,

04:38.900 --> 04:42.324
I WOULD NOT GET INTO
A WEIRD NOISE CONTEST.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.219
I LOVE THIS SONG.

04:50.230 --> 04:51.822
THIS, REALLY ?

04:52.760 --> 04:53.954
YEAH.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.520
MY DAD HAD ALL THESE OLD
BIG BAND RECORDS.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.725
IT ALWAYS
REMINDS ME OF...

04:58.730 --> 05:01.028
I DON'T KNOW,
BEING A KID.

05:01.030 --> 05:03.021
STILL BEING
BLISSFULLY IGNORANT

05:03.030 --> 05:05.351
ABOUT WHAT A SICK JOKE
LIFE CAN BE.

05:07.230 --> 05:08.720
I WOULD'VE
PEGGED YOU

05:08.730 --> 05:11.198
AS MORE OF A FAN OF...

05:11.200 --> 05:13.555
WHAT...
STING ?

05:13.560 --> 05:14.925
U2?

05:14.930 --> 05:16.352
YOU KNOW, GREW UP
IN THE '805

05:16.360 --> 05:18.749
BUT TOO STRAIGHT TO BE INTO
THE REALLY HARD CORE PUNK STUFF.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.091
OH, YEAH ?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.692
I SUPPOSE YOU WERE INTO
THE REALLY HARD CORE PUNK STUFF.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.759
I THINK IT WAS JUST
THE HEROIN TALKING.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.651
OH, MAN,
I LOVE THAT LOOK.

05:32.630 --> 05:34.723
I REALLY
SHOULD GO.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.756
MOM AND DAVID AND I ARE HAVING
SOME SORT OF FAMILY MEETING,

05:37.760 --> 05:41.719
TO DISCUSS WHETHER WE SHOULD
SELL THE BUSINESS TO KROEHNER.

05:41.730 --> 05:44.028
OH, GOD,
I HOPE WE WILL.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.122
WHY ?

05:47.130 --> 05:50.429
SO I CAN GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE
AND GO BACK TO SEA'I'I'LE.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.054
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME ?

05:57.060 --> 06:00.154
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.492
BECAUSE YOU ARE
MY WOMAN.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.818
YOU'RE OUT OF
YOUR MIND.

06:05.830 --> 06:06.819
OH, YEAH ?

06:06.830 --> 06:08.821
HOW COME MY NAME
IS BRANDED ON YOUR ASS ?

06:10.060 --> 06:12.290
I LOVE THAT LOOK.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.791
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.052
WE'RE UNDER SIEGE
BY A MAJOR CORPORATION.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.596
STOP BEING
SO DRAMATIC.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.828
MOM, IT'S A FACT.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.718
DAVID, WE ALL
HAVE PROBLEMS.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.153
THIS OAT BRAN IS
STUCK ON HERE LIKE CEMENT

06:24.160 --> 06:26.993
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
SOAK ANY WATER IN IT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.353
LISTEN TO ME.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.896
KROEHNER IS PRESSURING
OUR SUPPLIERS

06:29.900 --> 06:31.197
TO DEMAND
MONEY UP FRONT.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.849
NOW CONTINENTAL CASKETS
WANTS US TO PAY

06:32.860 --> 06:34.396
FOR ANYTHING WE PUT
IN THE SHOWROOM

06:34.400 --> 06:36.129
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY
SELL IT.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.688
THAT'S THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.294
YOUR FATHER NEVER LET
THESE THINGS GET TO HIM
LIKE YOU DO.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.155
WELL, HE NEVER HAD TO DEAL
WITH THIS KIND OF SITUATION.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.458
I'M SURE THINGS WILL WORK OUT,
THEY ALWAYS DO.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.052
NO, THEY DON'T.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.027
GOOD MORNING.

06:49.930 --> 06:52.194
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU ?

06:52.200 --> 06:53.758
NOTHING.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.993
OOH

07:00.000 --> 07:04.050
WHAT A LITTLE
MOONLIGHT CAN DO

07:06.760 --> 07:09.058
OOH

07:09.060 --> 07:12.598
WHAT A LITTLE
MOONLIGHT CAN DO TO YOU

07:14.760 --> 07:16.853
YOU'RE IN LO--

07:18.200 --> 07:21.124
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING HERE
UNTIL YOU PUT SOME FOOD
IN YOUR STOMACH.

07:21.130 --> 07:22.654
OH, I'M STARVING.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.721
ARE YOU BULIMIC ?

07:28.730 --> 07:31.290
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO DEAL WITH NOW ?

07:31.300 --> 07:34.053
MOM, APPARENTLY
YOU WANT A CHILD
WITH AN EATING DISORDER.

07:34.060 --> 07:34.958
'MORNING.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.725
HOW WAS
YOUR RUN ?

07:37.730 --> 07:39.095
I HAVEN'T
GONE YET.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.829
I STAYED OVER
AT BRENDA'S LAST NIGHT.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.695
NO ONE CARES
WHERE YOU WERE.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.122
WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE

07:44.130 --> 07:45.995
EVERY SINGLE THING
YOU DO ALL DAY ?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.729
SORRY, I FORGOT
WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO LIVE

07:47.730 --> 07:49.755
UNDER A SHROUD
OF SECRECY.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.997
SO, I THINK
WE SHOULD SELL.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.751
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT
JUST BECAUSE

07:59.760 --> 08:02.422
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS BUSINESS.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.898
COME ON, HAVE YOU
LOOKED AT THEIR OFFER ?

08:04.900 --> 08:06.549
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY,
STOCK OPTIONS ?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.425
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW ARROGANT YOU ARE ?

08:08.430 --> 08:10.318
YOU DON'T GET TO DECIDE
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

08:10.330 --> 08:12.321
I OWN HALF, DAVE.

08:12.330 --> 08:15.094
YOU HAVEN'T SPENT THE LAST
11 YEARS WORKING HERE.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.727
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP
ANYTHING FOR THIS.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.392
IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT
TO BE DOING WITH YOUR LIFE ?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.789
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO
MAKE A DEAD MAN HAPPY ?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.091
WE SHOULD HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION LATER.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.921
WHY CAN'T SHE
BE A PART OF THIS ?

08:27.930 --> 08:29.090
THANK YOU.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.689
NATE, THIS IS
ALL I KNOW.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.055
SO STAY AND RUN THE PLACE
FOR KROEHNER,

08:37.060 --> 08:39.028
OR GO TO LAW SCHOOL
LIKE YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

08:39.030 --> 08:41.123
TAKE MY TRUST FUND,
I'LL TAKE THE CASH.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.394
I THINK NATE'S RIGHT.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.925
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
ANY OF US HAS LEFT ?

08:47.930 --> 08:50.251
WE SHOULD DO WHAT
MAKES US HAPPY.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.797
FINE, SELL,
WHAT DO I CARE ?

08:55.060 --> 08:56.254
YOU MEAN IT ?

08:56.260 --> 08:57.420
SURE.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.898
LET'S JUST INVALIDATE
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

09:02.030 --> 09:04.453
I'LL GO TO GILARDI TODAY
AND TELL HIM OUR DECISION.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.449
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:08.460 --> 09:11.122
I GUESS THE ONE
WITH THE SATIN INTERIOR.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.325
MA, THERE WERE LIKE FIVE
WITH SATIN INTERIORS.

09:13.330 --> 09:14.888
LET'S JUST GO WITH
THE CLASSIC REGAL.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.253
( female )
I LIKED THE WHITE PEARL.

09:16.260 --> 09:17.921
THE CLASSIC REGAL
WILL BE FINE.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.329
WHO CARES ANYWAY ?

09:19.330 --> 09:21.457
MY TOMMY WAS CUT UP
INTO 50 PIECES

09:21.460 --> 09:24.020
BY A BIG GIANT
DOUGH MIXER.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.555
OH, MA, POP WASN'T
IN THAT MANY PIECES.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.449
MA, HE'S GONNA LOOK
JUST AS YOU REMEMBER HIM.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.791
RIGHT ?

09:31.800 --> 09:33.199
UM...

09:33.200 --> 09:34.952
IT SAYS
IN YOUR BROCHURE

09:34.960 --> 09:37.690
YOU HAVE A GIFTED
RESTORATIVE ARTIST,
WHATEVER.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.656
CAN HE MAKE SURE
POP LOOK GOOD ENOUGH

09:39.660 --> 09:41.252
FOR AN OPEN CASKET
OR NOT ?

09:41.260 --> 09:43.990
BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
WE'LL GO ELSEWHERE.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.151
YOU'LL BE COMPLETELY
SATISFIED WITH OUR WORK,
I GUARANTEE IT.

09:49.930 --> 09:52.455
HUMPTY-DUMPTY, HUH ?
TRAIN TRACKS ?

09:52.460 --> 09:54.519
DOUGH MIXER.

09:54.530 --> 09:57.556
CAN YOU GO TO SAINT JOSEPH'S
TO PICK HIM UP ?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.198
NOT TODAY.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.998
IT'S MY COUSIN RAMON'S
BABY'S CHRISTENING.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.558
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THIS.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.391
I'LL GIVE YOU
50 BUCKS EXTRA.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.651
A HUNDRED.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.457
I'M THE GODFATHER,
DAVID.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.257
SHIT.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.251
I CAN'T GO BECAUSE OF
MRS. BONDS' VIEWING,

10:12.260 --> 10:14.421
AND I CAN'T CALL THE SERVICE
BECAUSE KROEHNER TOLD MARTY

10:14.430 --> 10:16.489
IF HE DOES OUR PICK-UPS,
HE'LL LOSE ALL THEIR BUSINESS.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.819
SO SEND NATE.

10:17.830 --> 10:20.424
I KNOW HE HATES THIS SHIT, BUT
HE'S YOUR PARTNER NOW, RIGHT ?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.552
HE'S LIKE
IN A LOT OF PIECES.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.790
A HUMPTY-DUMPTY,
I KNOW.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.796
CAREFUL, THAT COULD
BE HIS HEAD.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.199
OH, JESUS.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.690
OR HIS PELVIS.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.520
IT'S PROBABLY
HIS HEAD.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.522
SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO RICO,
HE GET CANNED ?

10:42.530 --> 10:44.054
NO, HE'S JUST BUSY.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.459
YOU NEW
OVER THERE ?

10:45.460 --> 10:47.451
NO, I'M JUST
A TEMP.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.496
I HEARD OLD MAN
FISHER KICKED.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.058
YOU KNOW HIM ?

10:51.060 --> 10:52.857
NOT REALLY.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.158
HEY, NO OFFENSE, PAL,

10:55.160 --> 10:58.891
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CALL YOUR AGENCY AND
ASK FOR A NEW ASSIGNMENT.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.492
I'M ALREADY ON IT.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.854
HEY, GABE,

11:07.860 --> 11:10.351
I LOOKED FOR YOU
IN THE QUAD THIS MORNING,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.191
MAYBE YOU STAYED HOME

11:12.200 --> 11:14.452
'CAUSE YOU WERE
TIRED OR SOMETHING.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.722
ANYWAY,

11:16.730 --> 11:19.756
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.990
NOT IN
ANY SERIOUS WAY,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.525
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU CASUALLY.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.388
OKAY, BYE.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.698
I WANT
TO KILL MYSELF.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.389
IT'S SUCH A FUCKING
EASY DECISION FOR HIM.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.198
OH, AND THEN MOM
TAKES HIS SIDE, BIG SURPRISE.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.259
IT'S LIKE
I DON'T EVEN EXIST.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.592
LIKE ME GIVING UP LAW SCHOOL
MEANT NOTHING.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.999
SO, FIGHT.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.457
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO KEEP THE BUSINESS,
DON'T GIVE IT AWAY.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.950
SEE, THAT'S
JUST IT.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.394
ALL DAY LONG, I'VE BEEN FEELING
THIS INCREDIBLE SENSE OF...

12:18.400 --> 12:20.049
RELIEF.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.324
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO KEEP IT.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.423
I COULD DO ANYTHING,
I'M STILL YOUNG.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.727
RIGHT ?

12:25.730 --> 12:27.789
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
YOU'RE STILL A BABY.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.720
WHAT ABOUT
THAT ONE ?

12:32.730 --> 12:35.153
THAT'S A LITTLE
MAYBERRY FOR ME.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.720
SOMETHING SIMPLE
AND CLEAN.

12:37.730 --> 12:40.858
LIKE THE ONES THAT HANG
IN A DESERTED TRUCK STOP,

12:40.860 --> 12:43.454
WHEN THAT HANDSOME DRIFTER
BLOWS INTO TOWN.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.894
OF COURSE.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.249
WHAT ABOUT
THAT ONE ?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.696
NOT BAD.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.123
I COULD SEE AVA GARDNER
LYING BENEATH IT,

12:54.130 --> 12:56.451
PLOTTING TO STEAL CLARK GABLE
AWAY FROM GRACE KELLY.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.224
PEOPLE START THEIR LIVES
OVER ALL THE TIME, RIGHT ?

12:59.230 --> 13:01.152
YEAH.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.857
THAT GUY
JUST CRUISED YOU.

13:05.860 --> 13:07.088
REALLY ?

13:07.100 --> 13:08.624
BITCH.

13:08.630 --> 13:10.928
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
LIKE I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.124
HE DID ?

13:12.130 --> 13:13.722
AND I MISSED IT ?

13:13.730 --> 13:15.652
OH, SORRY.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.655
OH, RUTH.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.854
AMELIA.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.555
ANOTHER CASSEROLE.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.528
LEMON BARS.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.521
THE KIDS'LL
LOVE THEM.

13:26.530 --> 13:29.419
DON'T YOU HAVE
CANDY STRIPING TODAY ?

13:29.430 --> 13:30.749
I DID,

13:30.760 --> 13:34.127
BUT I TOLD THEM
MY BEST FRIEND NEEDED ME.

13:36.130 --> 13:37.950
YOU'VE MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

13:37.960 --> 13:38.949
I KNOW.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.689
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW MUCH MONEY

13:40.700 --> 13:42.725
THERE WAS TO BE MADE
IN THE FUNERAL BUSINESS.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.027
DEATH CARE INDUSTRY.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.657
AND IT'S ONLY
GONNA GROW,

13:45.660 --> 13:47.196
WITH ALL
THE BABY BOOMERS
AND ALL.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.054
GEE, THERE'LL BE
BODIES EVERYWHERE.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.527
HOPEFULLY.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.226
AND ALL IN FINAL RESTING PLACES
PROVIDED BY KROEHNER,

13:53.230 --> 13:55.551
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM FISHER & SONS.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.324
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD OUR EYES
ON YOUR OPERATION FOR SOME TIME.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.798
YOUR FATHER
WAS A NICE GUY,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.394
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.994
WELL, MY DAD WAS NEVER
IN IT FOR THE MONEY.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.888
I THINK HE WAS MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

14:07.900 --> 14:09.527
HELPING PEOPLE.

14:09.530 --> 14:12.124
YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE,
JOIN THE PEACE CORP.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.358
YEAH.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.453
GREEDY LITTLE
NAZI FUCK.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.996
SO, HOW EXACTLY
WILL THIS WORK ?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.355
WE WON'T CHANGE THE APPEARANCE
OF YOUR UNIT AT ALL.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.794
MAYBE A LITTLE COSMETIC
UPGRADING PERHAPS.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.018
BUT, PREPARATION OF LOVED ONES
WILL NOW TAKE PLACE

14:26.030 --> 14:28.351
AT A CENTRALIZED
LOCATION,

14:28.360 --> 14:30.749
WHICH SERVICES
SEVERAL OTHER UNITS.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.024
TECHNICIANS ON STAFF,
CONSTANTLY PRODUCING.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.658
SO, IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE FACTORY...
OF EMBALMING.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.322
PREPARATION
FOR VISITATION.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.651
NOW WE MAINTAIN
A SMALL FLEET OF VEHICLES.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.524
HEARSES ?

14:41.530 --> 14:42.497
FUNERAL CARRIAGES.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.421
DEADWAGONS.

14:43.430 --> 14:44.988
REMOVAL VANS.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.150
ONCE YOU
CENTRALIZE OPERATIONS,

14:47.160 --> 14:50.049
YOU'D BE AMAZED
HOW YOU MAXIMIZE PROFITS.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.923
SO IN THE END,
WE'LL ALL JUST HUMAN MCNUGGETS.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.649
JUST AS WE BEGAN.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.127
I LIKE YOU, NATE.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.655
YOU HEAR THAT,
BUDDY BOY ?
HE LIKES YOU.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.424
WOW, YOU ARE
SO COOL.

15:07.230 --> 15:09.721
YOUR INITIAL
PAYMENT, SIR.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.894
THE REST WILL FOLLOW

15:12.900 --> 15:15.221
AFTER BOTH OF OUR LAWYERS
HAVE HELD UP THE PROCESS

15:15.230 --> 15:17.596
LONG ENOUGH TO
JUSTIFY THEIR FEES.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.398
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'D LIKE TO
SEND A FACILITIES INSPECTOR OUT

15:20.400 --> 15:22.891
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THINGS
AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.659
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.151
HEY.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.827
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

15:42.800 --> 15:44.995
YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.458
UMM...

15:47.460 --> 15:50.998
WHY IS MY CAR COVERED
WITH WORDS LIKE "TOE SUCKER" ?

15:53.530 --> 15:55.521
I DON'T KNOW.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.194
YOU DIDN'T, FOR INSTANCE,
BLAB TO YOUR FRIENDS

15:59.200 --> 16:01.589
THAT YOU BAGGED ME AND THAT
I SUCKED YOUR TOES ?

16:04.260 --> 16:06.899
I MIGHT HAVE TOLD
ONE PERSON.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.197
AN DY.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.395
HE ASKED ME WHAT I DID
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

16:10.400 --> 16:12.493
SO, I TOLD HIM.

16:15.330 --> 16:18.493
IT'S NOT LIKE I THOUGHT
THIS WAS GONNA WORK OUT,

16:18.500 --> 16:21.253
BECAUSE I KNOW
NOTHING EVER WORKS OUT.

16:21.260 --> 16:23.694
BUT I GUESS I JUST WANTED
TO ENJOY THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.725
INSTEAD,
THE WHOLE WORLD'S
CALLING ME

16:25.730 --> 16:27.550
"THIS LITTLE
PIGGY LOVER."

16:29.530 --> 16:31.350
I'M SORRY.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.851
COME ON,
SO WHAT ?

16:33.860 --> 16:35.896
SO WHAT, SO, IT GOT OUT,
WHO CARES ?

16:35.900 --> 16:38.198
YOU KNOW WHAT I WISH ?
I WISH THAT JUST ONCE

16:38.200 --> 16:41.124
PEOPLE WOULDN'T ACT LIKE
THE CLICH ES THAT THEY ARE.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.160
THIS CAN GO
TO GOODWILL.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.048
AND THIS...

16:51.030 --> 16:52.395
AND THIS ONE TOO.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.795
MAYBE NATHANIEL'S CLOTHES
ARE TOO DULL FOR GOODWILL.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.995
DOES GOODWILL
EVER REFUSE ANYTHING ?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.651
RUTH, IF YOU
WANT TO CRY, CRY.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.628
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

17:03.630 --> 17:06.827
JUST LET IT OUT,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

17:06.830 --> 17:08.889
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'M FINE.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.856
I JUST THINK
IT'S VERY INTERESTING

17:10.860 --> 17:12.725
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE MAKING TWO PILES,

17:12.730 --> 17:15.551
ONE FOR GOODWILL
AND ONE FOR MEMORIES,

17:15.560 --> 17:18.723
AND YET, YOU HAVE NOT
HELD ONTO ONE THING.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.891
THE MEMORY PILE
WAS YOUR STUPID IDEA.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.221
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH NATHANIEL'S OLD CLOTHES ?

17:23.230 --> 17:25.323
MAKE PILLOWS,
A QUILT ?

17:25.330 --> 17:27.696
I OUGHTA JUST
BURN THEM ALL.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.260
HOW CAN SOMEONE
WITH SO LITTLE CLOTHING

17:30.260 --> 17:32.421
HAVE SO MUCH
CLOTHING ?

17:32.430 --> 17:33.454
WHAT IS THIS ?

17:35.530 --> 17:36.997
NOTHING.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.149
IT'S STUPID.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.094
SOMETHING ABOUT VISITING
THE PYRAMIDS,

17:40.100 --> 17:42.193
TAKING
BALLET LESSONS ?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.521
I WROTE DOWN THINGS
I MIGHT WANT TO DO
NOW THAT I'M--

17:44.530 --> 17:45.792
I HAVE MORE TIME.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.756
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.091
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.518
IT'S STUPID.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.919
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO DO
ANY OF THESE THINGS.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.955
I JUST DID IT BECAUSE
SOME BOOK TOLD ME TO.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.894
WHAT AM I, GONNA BE
IN "SWAN LAKE" ?

17:57.900 --> 17:59.128
WHY NOT ?

17:59.130 --> 18:01.291
YOU SEE STORIES LIKE THAT
ON THE NEWS ALL THE TIME.

18:01.300 --> 18:02.528
IT'S INSPIRING.

18:02.530 --> 18:05.192
IT'S DEPRESSING,
IT SEEMS SO DESPERATE.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.657
MAYBE IT'S
A LITTLE DESPERATE.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.360
BESIDES,
WHO KNOWS ?

18:11.360 --> 18:15.296
IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE
YOU MIGHT MEET A MAN.

18:15.300 --> 18:18.622
THAT PART
OF MY LIFE IS OVER.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.350
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO FLIP THIS MATTRESS
EVERY TWO MONTHS.

18:25.530 --> 18:28.192
I DO MINE
EVERY 14 WEEKS.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.498
I CAN'T REMEMBER
EVER FLIPPING THIS.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.650
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN
20 YEARS.

18:32.660 --> 18:33.888
C'MON, GET UP.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.494
YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED GOING
THROUGH NATHANIEL'S CLOTHES.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.351
RUTH...

18:41.360 --> 18:44.227
RUTH, HOW CAN
I HELP YOU ?

18:44.230 --> 18:47.256
YOU CAN LIFT
THIS UP WITH ME.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.492
AN UNCOVERED MATTRESS
IS SO SAD.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.525
HELP ME
TURN THIS OVER !

19:12.730 --> 19:15.198
DOES IT FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT ?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.849
NO.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.193
( protesters yelling )
SAVE OUR PARK... !

19:25.200 --> 19:29.990
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK... !

19:30.000 --> 19:33.754
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK !

19:33.760 --> 19:37.753
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK !

19:37.760 --> 19:41.821
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK !

19:41.830 --> 19:46.199
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK... !

20:06.530 --> 20:09.090
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

20:09.100 --> 20:12.149
YOU HAVE A GIFT,
YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.754
FINE.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.558
GO BACK TO PEDDLING SOY MILK
AND NAILING WAITRESSES.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.892
WHAT DO I CARE ?
I'M DEAD.

20:25.460 --> 20:26.654
( honking )

20:26.660 --> 20:28.651
( male )
MOVE IT, ASSHOLE !

20:28.660 --> 20:32.994
SAVE OUR PARK,
SAVE OUR PARK... !

20:33.000 --> 20:35.150
SO NOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO SELL.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.299
I KNOW
IT SOUNDS CRAZY.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.949
OH NO,
NOT AT ALL.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.655
WE'LL KEEP THE BUSINESS
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

20:40.660 --> 20:42.423
THEN SELL IT AGAIN TOMORROW
FOR A FEW HOURS.

20:42.430 --> 20:43.624
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

20:43.630 --> 20:45.257
NO, NO, THIS IS
A GOOD SYSTEM.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.750
WE'LL SELL IN THE MORNINGS,
KEEP IT IN THE AFTERNOONS.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.421
MAYBE SOMETIMES WE SELL
AGAIN IN THE EVENINGS

20:48.430 --> 20:50.193
WHEN WE REALLY CAN'T
MAKE A DECISION.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.849
DAVID, YOU'RE NOT
BEING FAIR.

20:51.860 --> 20:54.795
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT TO SELL,
YOU COULD'VE CARED LESS.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.756
WHEN NATE DOESN'T
WANT TO SELL, YOU LISTEN.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.159
OKAY,
I'M A TERRIBLE MOTHER

20:58.160 --> 21:00.651
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL YOUR PROBLEMS,
HAPPY ?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.549
SO, WHAT, YOU HAD
SOME REVELATION

21:04.560 --> 21:06.892
AND NOW YOU WANT TO BE
A FUNERAL DIRECTOR ?

21:06.900 --> 21:08.458
HOW LONG IS THAT
GOING TO LAST ?

21:08.460 --> 21:09.893
HE DOES HAVE
A POINT, NATE.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.629
YOU DON'T ALWAYS
STICK WITH THINGS.

21:11.630 --> 21:13.097
I MEAN, COME ON,
YOU CAN'T EVEN STAND

21:13.100 --> 21:14.829
TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM
WITH A DEAD BODY.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.492
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
A REASON FOR THAT.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.253
THIS IS WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

21:20.260 --> 21:23.627
WHICH IS WHY
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME
RUNNING AWAY FROM IT.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.523
MY WHOLE LIFE,
I'VE BEEN A TOURIST.

21:35.530 --> 21:37.623
NOW I HAVE THE CHANCE
TO DO SOME GOOD,

21:37.630 --> 21:40.019
INSTEAD OF JUST
SUCKING UP AIR.

21:40.030 --> 21:42.248
I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO ASK
OF YOU, I KNOW.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.956
BUT I JUST REALLY THINK
THAT WE CAN DO THIS.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.292
YOU AND ME,
TOGETHER.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.154
BROTHERS.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.094
LIKE WE USED TO BE.

21:55.660 --> 21:58.720
WE COULD STILL SELL TO KROEHNER
AND BOTH MANAGE FISHER & SONS.

21:58.730 --> 22:01.028
YEAH, BUT THEN
WE'RE JUST SPOKESMODELS

22:01.030 --> 22:04.090
WORKING TO MAKE FAT,
REPUBLICAN STOCKHOLDERS RICHER.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.250
AND KROEHNER DOESN'T
GIVE A SHIT ABOUT PEOPLE.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.852
WE CARE, WE CAN HELP THEM
THROUGH THEIR GRIEF.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.350
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.896
THIS IS A BUSINESS, NATE,
IT'S NOT A CHARITY.

22:10.900 --> 22:12.356
OF COURSE
IT'S A BUSINESS.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.249
BUT, IT'S MORE THAN THAT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

22:21.930 --> 22:23.591
OKAY.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.090
GREAT.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.524
I'LL CALL GILARDI AND TELL HIM
HE CAN KISS OUR COLLECTIVE ASS.

22:28.530 --> 22:29.895
LANGUAGE.

22:30.530 --> 22:32.851
MAYBE DAD KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.452
( cork popping )

22:37.460 --> 22:39.018
OH!
OH!

22:40.200 --> 22:42.657
YOU REALLY DID NOT HAVE TO
WASTE THIS STUFF ON ME.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.695
OH, PLEASE.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.429
MY PARENTS
GOT A CASE OF IT

22:45.430 --> 22:48.524
FROM SOME TV MOVIE THEY WERE
TECHNICAL ADVISORS ON.

22:48.530 --> 22:51.624
SOME SERIAL KILLER THING
FOR CABLE.

22:51.630 --> 22:54.224
OH, THEY'RE SUCH WHORES,
THEY'LL DO ANYTHING.

22:54.230 --> 22:55.891
GOSH.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.596
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS STUFF IS EXPENSIVE ?

23:01.100 --> 23:03.728
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO TELL OFF SOME CORPORATE SUIT,

23:03.730 --> 23:06.893
SOME GREEDY LITTLE
NAZI FUCK, YOU KNOW ?

23:07.700 --> 23:09.622
THAT'S VERY HOSTILE.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.689
NO, I WAS
VERY DIPLOMATIC.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.850
I JUST SAID, "THANKS,
BUT WE CHANGED OUR MINDS."

23:13.860 --> 23:15.418
WHAT'D HE DO ?

23:15.430 --> 23:18.524
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO ?

23:18.530 --> 23:20.794
THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.052
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU ?
THE BAXTERS CHANGED THEIR MIND.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.550
THEY'VE GOING WITH
THE UNGER MORTUARY.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.528
WAS THERE
A REASON ?

23:26.530 --> 23:30.057
THEY PROBABLY
JUST UNDERBID YOU.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.824
I KNOW HAL UNGER,
HE NEVER UNDERBID ANYBODY.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.149
UNGER MOVED
TO FLORIDA.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.048
THEY WERE BOUGHT OUT
BY KROEHNER MONTHS AGO.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.288
SIGN HERE.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.527
YOU KNOW,

23:41.530 --> 23:44.897
I DIDN'T JUST DECIDE
TO STAY IN LOS ANGELES
'CAUSE OF THE BUSINESS.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.856
I HAD
ANOTHER REASON.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.794
OH, PLEASE,
DON'T RUIN THIS.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.825
I'VE GOT SUCH
A NICE BUZZ GOING.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.728
IT WAS YOU.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.759
NATE,
GET SERIOUS.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.057
IT'S TRUE.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.721
NO, IT'S NOT.

23:57.730 --> 23:59.049
YOU'RE STAYING HERE

23:59.060 --> 24:01.324
BECAUSE YOU FOUND SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

24:01.330 --> 24:04.356
I AM THE EXTRA BONUS THAT
PROBABLY WON'T WORK OUT.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.727
SOMETIMES YOUR HONESTY
GETS REALLY TIRESOME.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.128
I DON'T WANT
ANY CHILDREN.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.155
WHOA, WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT CHILDREN ?

24:13.160 --> 24:15.492
I WAS
REFERRING TO YOU.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.957
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.528
OPEN IT.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.454
"THE GLEN MILLER ORCHESTRA
AT THE HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM."

24:37.460 --> 24:39.223
BRENDA,
THIS IS SO COOL.

24:39.230 --> 24:41.050
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO THE PALLADIUM.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.358
YOU GREW UP IN LA. AND YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN TO THE PALLADIUM ?

24:43.360 --> 24:44.691
THAT'S PATH ETIC.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.199
THESE ARE FOR
THREE WEEKS FROM NOW.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.021
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WOULDN'T BE IN SEATTLE ?

24:51.030 --> 24:52.895
I DIDN'T.

25:41.130 --> 25:42.825
GOOD MORNING, RICO.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.752
JUST WHAT I NEED,

25:44.760 --> 25:46.694
ANOTHER BOSS
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.951
HEY, PUT ME TO WORK.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.894
( phone )

25:51.230 --> 25:53.118
HELLO ?

25:53.130 --> 25:55.792
TE DIJE,
NO HE DECIDIDO...

25:56.600 --> 25:59.398
Y ESTA
ES MI DECISION...

26:00.560 --> 26:04.621
SI ME VOY CON KROEHNER
ESTARIA TRABAJANDO
MAS HORAS QUE AQUI.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.793
UN MOMENTO.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.724
PREGNANCY'S KICKED VANESSA'S
HORMONES INTO OVERLOAD.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.357
I GOTTA GO
TALK HER DOWN.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.896
LOOK, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO HELP,

26:13.900 --> 26:16.152
TAKE MR. ROMANO OUT OF THE BAG
AND PUT HIM ON THE TABLE.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.651
AND REMEMBER, BREATHE
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH,
HE'S PRETTY RIPE.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.289
OH, CHRIST.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.722
NATE...

26:56.730 --> 26:58.357
GREAT, LOOK WHAT
YOU MADE ME DO.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.055
OH, GROSS.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.995
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

27:04.060 --> 27:06.028
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU NOTICED,

27:06.030 --> 27:09.090
BUT I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW
SWIMMING IN A MAN'S GUTS.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.653
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.855
I'M PICKING UP
A PART OF A PERSON

27:16.860 --> 27:18.999
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT PART IT IS !

27:19.000 --> 27:22.049
FINE, I'LL
TALK TO YOU LATER.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.753
OH, GOD.

27:31.230 --> 27:32.720
SORRY.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.391
(vomiting )

27:44.330 --> 27:46.798
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING ?

27:46.800 --> 27:49.257
I WORK HERE NOW,
I HAVE TO BE A PART OF THINGS.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.728
LET RICO
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.721
I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU

27:53.730 --> 27:56.290
THAT'S MUCH BETTER SUITED
TO YOUR PARTICULAR TALENTS.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.318
MORNING, NATE.

28:11.330 --> 28:13.423
LOVELY DAY,
ISN'T IT ?

28:13.430 --> 28:15.421
I'VE SEEN BETTER.

28:15.430 --> 28:17.955
I ONLY WANTED
TO SAY HELLO,

28:17.960 --> 28:19.894
SEEING THAT
I'M YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.195
WE JUST BOUGHT THAT HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.891
GOT IT
FOR A SONG, TOO.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.322
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

28:30.330 --> 28:31.922
WE'RE PLANNING TO PUT YOU
OUT OF BUSINESS

28:31.930 --> 28:33.625
IN SIX MONTHS.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.849
THEY'RE OPENING
A POSEIDON SOCIETY
ACROSS THE STREET ?

28:36.860 --> 28:37.952
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.724
WHAT IS
A POSEIDON SOCIETY ?

28:40.730 --> 28:43.096
THEY SELL CREMATIONS,
CHEAP CREMATIONS.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.022
NOW FOR A FRACTION
OF WHAT WE CHARGE,

28:45.030 --> 28:47.954
YOU CAN DUMP OFF THE RELATIVE
YOU NEVER REALLY LIKED ANYWAY

28:47.960 --> 28:50.497
AT THE TORCH MART
ACROSS THE STREET.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.697
I GUESS WE HAVE TO JUST
CONTINUE TO DO OUR BEST.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.219
AND HOW EXACTLY
DO WE DO THAT ?

28:57.230 --> 28:59.551
YOU KNOW LOU, THE FLORIST,
THAT SWEET OLD GUY ?

28:59.560 --> 29:01.892
HE'S JUST UPPED WHAT
HE CHARGES US BY 200 PERCENT.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.994
AND THAT CHEMICAL DEALER
ON FIGUEROA IS NOW SUING US

29:05.000 --> 29:07.753
OVER SOME NONEXSISTANT
SHIPMENT OF CAVITY FLUID.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.524
AND EVERY OTHER SUPPLIER THAT
WE HAVE IN COMMON WITH KROEHNER

29:10.530 --> 29:13.749
HAS SUDDENLY DEVELOPED
SOME SORT OF PROBLEM
WITH FISHER & SONS.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.524
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON
BY THE NAME OF KROEHNER,

29:16.530 --> 29:19.055
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS GOING
TO INSPECT US NEXT WEEK.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.221
SO WHAT,
ISN'T EVERYTHING CLEAN ?

29:21.230 --> 29:22.959
YES,

29:22.960 --> 29:25.451
BUT ANY INSPECTION MEANS
WE HAVE TO UPDATE SOMETHING.

29:25.460 --> 29:28.623
IF IT'S
THE VENTILATION SYSTEM
WE'RE SUNK.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.992
WE SHOULD'VE SOLD.

29:32.830 --> 29:35.993
UH, NATE,
I'M HAVING A PROBLEM.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.197
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
MR. ROMANO'S FOOT
ON YOU, DO YOU ?

29:42.600 --> 29:45.558
( David )
DO YOU REMEMBER
PICKING UP THE FOOT ?

29:45.560 --> 29:46.959
I THINK SO,

29:46.960 --> 29:49.428
BUT MY EYES WERE SHUT
AND I WAS TRYING NOT TO VOMIT.

29:49.430 --> 29:51.455
( David )
I'M NOT HAPPY.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.627
WELL, THAT'S VERY
INTERESTING, DAVID,
BECAUSE I'M ECSTATIC.

29:57.730 --> 30:00.426
MAYBE THE MORGUE
NEVER GAVE US THAT FOOT.

30:00.430 --> 30:04.025
BOTH FEET ARE LISTED
IN THE PAPERWORK, NATE.

30:04.030 --> 30:05.520
JUST THINK, NATE,

30:05.530 --> 30:07.395
IS THERE ANY OTHER POINT
YOU COULD'VE LOST IT ?

30:07.400 --> 30:08.458
LOST WHAT ?

30:08.460 --> 30:09.757
NOTHING.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.648
IF YOU LOST SOMETHING,
LOOK UNDER THE BED.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.423
THAT'S WHERE THINGS
ALWAYS TURN UP.

30:13.430 --> 30:15.193
I DOUBT THAT APPLIES
IN THIS CASE.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.259
THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY,

30:17.260 --> 30:19.524
THEN THEY FIND WHATEVER IT IS
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
UNDER THE BED.

30:19.530 --> 30:21.327
MOM, WE'RE REALLY
BUSY DOWN HERE.

30:21.330 --> 30:23.355
THE UPSTAIRS MACHINE
IS BROKEN.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.328
I CALLED
THE REPAIRMAN, BUT--

30:25.330 --> 30:27.992
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT IS THIS ?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.958
SOMEONE LEFT A KLEENEX
IN THEIR POCKET

30:30.960 --> 30:33.895
AND NOW IT'S
ALL OVER EVERYTHING.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.055
IT'S DISGUSTING.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.020
NATE,
RETRACE YOUR STEPS.

30:44.030 --> 30:46.624
IS THERE ANY OTHER POINT
YOU COULD'VE LOST THE FOOT ?

30:46.630 --> 30:49.554
I ALMOST DROPPED HIM
AT THE MORGUE,

30:49.560 --> 30:51.551
BUT THE BAG
DIDN'T OPEN.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.757
I TRIPPED ON THE STAIRS,
BUT NOTHING FELL OUT.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.092
I BANGED INTO
THE FREEZER, NOTHING.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.419
SPILLED HIM
ONTO THE FLOOR, BUT--

30:58.430 --> 30:59.829
AND I PICKED HIM UP
FROM OFF THE FLOOR.

30:59.830 --> 31:01.525
IT SHOULD BE HERE.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.626
I'D SAY IT'S AN
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.019
AT LEAST.

31:19.030 --> 31:21.624
LIKE MY NEW SHOES ?
THEY'RE SIZE 12.

31:21.630 --> 31:22.927
TOE SLUT.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.454
AMELIA ?

32:11.460 --> 32:13.997
IT'S ME, RUTH.

32:15.230 --> 32:17.790
YOUR BEST FRIEND
NEEDS HELP.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.325
OH!

32:32.330 --> 32:34.719
IS HE ALL
PUT TOGETHER ?

32:34.730 --> 32:36.459
OH, HE'S 100% THERE.

32:36.460 --> 32:37.859
ABSOLUTELY.

32:37.860 --> 32:40.124
I'D LIKE
TO SEE HIM.

32:42.330 --> 32:44.423
I'M SORRY,

32:44.430 --> 32:47.149
OUR EMBALMER IS A LITTLE
ON THE ARTISTIC SIDE.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.458
HE GETS CRAZY
IF HE HAS ANY INPUT.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.190
IT'S BEST TO WAIT UNTIL
WE'RE COMPLETELY DONE.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.997
ONE MORE THING.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.558
HIS SHOES.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.750
WHAT ARE YOU,
AN IDIOT ?

32:59.760 --> 33:01.318
THOSE ARE
HIS FAVORITE SHOES.

33:01.330 --> 33:02.854
HE HAS PERFECT LY
COMFORTABLE LOAFERS,

33:02.860 --> 33:05.055
WHICH WOULD BE
MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.618
YES, I MYSELF
HAVE LOAFERS

33:06.630 --> 33:09.098
WHICH ARE JUST LIKE
WALKING ON AIR.

33:11.060 --> 33:13.096
WE SHOULD'VE
JUST TOLD THEM THE TRUTH.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.727
SORRY,
MRS. ROMANO,

33:14.730 --> 33:17.858
BUT MY IDIOT OF A BROTHER
LOST A PART OF YOUR HUSBAND.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.225
YEAH, THAT
WOULD'VE WORKED.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.118
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?

33:21.130 --> 33:23.451
I HAVE SOMEPLACE
I HAVE TO BE.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.951
WHEN I RETURN I HOPE TO BE
GREETED BY A FOOT,

33:25.960 --> 33:28.952
A SOLUTION AS TO HOW TO STOP
BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION

33:28.960 --> 33:30.689
FROM PUTTING US
OUT OF BUSINESS,

33:30.700 --> 33:32.793
AND PRUNED HEDGES.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.919
AREN'T YOU GLAD
YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOUSE ?

33:39.930 --> 33:41.693
YES, THIS IS
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.895
WE SHOULD TRY AND GET
A SEAT RIGHT IN FRONT.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.527
I'M PLACING A BET.

33:45.530 --> 33:47.953
WE SHOULD JUST TRY
AND ENJOY THE DAY.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.053
I DON'T SEE
WHY WE NEED TO GAMBLE.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.627
THAT'S SWEET.

33:55.630 --> 33:58.349
YOU BOTH
LOOK SO HAPPY.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.499
IT'S JUST
AN ACT.

34:00.500 --> 34:03.355
JUST ENJOY IT
WHILE IT LASTS,

34:03.360 --> 34:05.294
WHICH ISN'T
VERY LONG.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.858
EXCUSE ME ?

34:06.860 --> 34:09.397
YOU THINK YOU HAVE FOREVER,
BUT YOU DON'T.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.891
SOON YOU START TO
GET ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES,

34:11.900 --> 34:15.028
THEN YOU DON'T
TELL THE OTHER PERSON
AS MUCH AS YOU USED TO

34:15.030 --> 34:17.055
BECAUSE REALLY,
WHAT'S THE POINT ?

34:17.060 --> 34:18.994
YOU THOUGHT
THEY UNDERSTOOD YOU.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.353
BUT THEY NEVER DID,
NOT REALLY.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.191
RUTH.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.327
FINALLY, NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT
TELL THE OTHER PERSON
ANYTHING REAL,

34:24.330 --> 34:26.321
YOU ACT IVELY
START LYING TO HIM.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.355
AND THEN WHEN YOU THINK
IT CAN'T GET ANY WORSE,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.896
HE UP AND DIES.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.698
I THINK I SEE
A SHORTER LINE OVER THERE.

34:32.700 --> 34:33.689
BYE.

34:35.430 --> 34:38.524
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
YOU END UP ALONE !

34:38.530 --> 34:41.556
NOT KNOWING WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU REALLY WANT !

34:41.560 --> 34:43.323
RUTH, RUTH,

34:43.330 --> 34:45.696
WHY DID WE
COME HERE TODAY ?

34:45.700 --> 34:48.157
TO HAVE FUN,
AREN'T YOU HAVING FUN ?

34:51.160 --> 34:52.957
I THINK
IT'S WOBBLING.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.656
IT'S NOT WOBBLING, IT JUST
LOOKS LIKE IT'S WOBBLING

34:55.660 --> 34:57.924
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
STARING AT IT FOR SO LONG.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.795
IT'S DEFINITELY
WOBBLING.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.950
YOU'RE HALLUCINATING.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.848
LIFE IS STRANGE.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.454
IF JUST ONE OF THOSE TINY SCREWS
ISN'T SCREWED ON TIGHT ENOUGH,

35:06.460 --> 35:09.952
THAT THING COULD FALL
AND KILL US INSTANTANEOUSLY.

35:09.960 --> 35:12.428
JUST CHOP US TO BITS,
LIKE A CUISINART.

35:13.630 --> 35:16.690
YEAH, AND AN ASSASSIN
WITH A SEMI-AUTOMATIC

35:16.700 --> 35:18.327
COULD WALK
THROUGH THE DOOR

35:18.330 --> 35:21.094
AND SPRAY OUR BRAINS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.056
OR THE SUN COULD
BECOME A SUPERNOVA

35:23.060 --> 35:25.790
AND ENGULF
THE ENTIRE PLANET
IN FLAMES.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.888
( phone )

35:29.900 --> 35:32.118
DAVID FISHER.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.655
WE JUST GOT A CALL
FROM CLAIRE'S SCHOOL.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.059
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.891
CAN'T MOM
HANDLE THIS ?

35:37.900 --> 35:39.595
SHE'S M.I.A.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.649
AND BESIDES, I THINK
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN WHAT THEY TOLD ME.

35:44.930 --> 35:46.921
WHAT ?
START FROM THE BEGINNING.

35:49.660 --> 35:50.888
JESUS.

35:52.030 --> 35:54.453
OKAY, I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

35:54.460 --> 35:56.519
UNTIL THEN,
TELL NATE TO--

35:56.530 --> 35:58.998
OH, GREAT,
HE'S M.I.A. TOO ?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.627
ALRIGHT, BYE.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.893
THERE'S A RUMOR
GOING AROUND SCHOOL

36:04.900 --> 36:07.152
THAT MY SISTER
PUT A DISMEMBERED FOOT

36:07.160 --> 36:09.048
INTO SOME
BOY'S LOCKER.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.721
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

36:25.860 --> 36:28.499
SHE DID IT,
I KNOW SHE DID.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.954
WHERE'S
THE FOOT NOW ?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.451
I DON'T KNOW, THE STUDENT
WHO SUPPOSEDLY FOUND IT

36:34.460 --> 36:36.826
NOW DENIES
THAT IT EVER HAPPENED.

36:36.830 --> 36:38.388
OKAY,
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER ?

36:38.400 --> 36:40.459
NO ONE KNOWS,
A POLICE REPORT
HAS BEEN FILED

36:40.460 --> 36:42.155
AND NOW MOM
IS SUPPOSED TO MEET

36:42.160 --> 36:43.798
WITH THE PRINCIPAL
AT NINE TOMORROW.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.121
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND KIDS.

36:46.130 --> 36:48.394
WHEN I WAS HER AGE, I NEVER
WOULD'VE TAKEN A FOOT.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.425
DAVID, I CAN HELP,
I'M A COP.

36:50.430 --> 36:52.421
THAT'S WHAT
I DO FOR A LIVING.

36:52.430 --> 36:54.796
YOU FIND FEET ?

36:55.900 --> 36:58.494
( Nate )
WHAT THE FUCK
AM I GONNA DO ?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.456
( Brenda )
TELL ME WHO
LIVED HERE AGAIN ?

37:00.460 --> 37:02.655
THE FRITZENS.

37:04.430 --> 37:07.058
I HAVE TOTALLY
FUCKED THINGS UP.

37:07.060 --> 37:09.597
I KEPT US FROM SELLING
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO UNDER,

37:09.600 --> 37:11.989
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME,
I'M A FUCKING MORON.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.854
YOU USED TO
HANG OUT OVER HERE ?

37:13.860 --> 37:15.999
JEANNIE FRITZEN AND I USED TO
PLAY IN HERE AFTER SCHOOL,

37:16.000 --> 37:17.558
BOTH HER PARENTS WORKED.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.427
BRENDA,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

37:20.430 --> 37:22.819
MY ENTIRE FAMILY
COULD GO BANKRUPT.

37:22.830 --> 37:24.821
SO, SWALLOW
YOUR PRIDE.

37:24.830 --> 37:27.390
GO BACK TO
THE CORPORATION
AND SELL.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.025
THEY'LL CUT THEIR OFFER
IN HALF NOW

37:31.030 --> 37:33.328
KNOWING WE'RE SO QUICK
TO BUCKLE UNDER.

37:33.330 --> 37:36.424
PLUS, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
LET THAT GREEDY LITTLE NAZI WIN.

37:36.430 --> 37:39.456
OH, SO THIS IS
A PISSING CONTEST.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.754
( kids laughing )

37:44.760 --> 37:47.991
( girl )
NATE, I'M GOING
TO KISS YOU !

37:51.860 --> 37:54.328
I LOST SOMEONE'S
FOOT TODAY.

37:54.330 --> 37:57.299
( laughing )

37:58.900 --> 38:00.356
SORRY.

38:01.930 --> 38:04.592
I REALLY THOUGHT I HAD
LIKE, THIS...

38:04.600 --> 38:07.228
PROFOUND REVELATION.

38:08.530 --> 38:11.454
FUCK, IF THIS ISN'T
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING WITH MY LIFE,

38:11.460 --> 38:12.757
THEN WHAT IS ?

38:12.760 --> 38:14.022
LIVING IT.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.055
AND YOU'RE DOING THAT,
SO RELAX.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.596
YOU DON'T
REALLY GIVE A FUCK

38:17.600 --> 38:19.397
ABOUT WHAT
I'M GOING THROUGH,
DO YOU ?

38:19.400 --> 38:20.492
SURE.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.252
AS MUCH AS I CAN,

38:22.260 --> 38:25.127
GIVEN WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
LESS THAN A MONTH.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.192
THERE'S NO
BIG INVESTMENT.

38:31.200 --> 38:34.124
I MEAN, THAT'S PART OF
THE APPEAL FOR BOTH OF US.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.697
RIGHT ?

38:41.300 --> 38:42.494
RIGHT ?

38:54.260 --> 38:57.388
JEANNIE FRITZEN TRIED TO
KISS ME IN THIS ROOM.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.095
I WOULDN'T LET HER.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.058
YOU CAN'T CONTROL THINGS,
NOBODY CAN.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.596
SHUT UP.

39:04.600 --> 39:07.251
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT'S CERTAIN.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.228
EVERYTHING CHANGES.

39:09.230 --> 39:12.393
SHUT... UP.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.258
I ALREADY TALKED
TO THE OTHER COPS.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.820
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

39:38.830 --> 39:40.798
BECAUSE THIS TIME
I WANT THE TRUTH.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.654
A WITNESS ALREADY SAID

39:42.660 --> 39:44.525
SHE SAW YOU RUNNING
DOWN THE HALL

39:44.530 --> 39:46.953
SCREAMING THE CRAZY
FUNERAL HOME GIRL
PUT A FOOT IN YOUR LOCKER.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.724
IT WAS A JOKE, OKAY ?
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

39:49.730 --> 39:52.324
SHE'S JUST THIS GIRL
WHO'S KIND OF A LOSER,
AND WE ALL PICK ON HER.

39:52.330 --> 39:53.991
SHE TOTALLY
ASKS FOR IT.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.525
YOU KNOW, MODERN TECHNOLOGY
IS REALLY SOMETHING.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.657
I DON'T CARE, MAN.

39:58.660 --> 39:59.820
YOU SHOULD.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.128
WE NOW HAVE CHEMICALS
WE CAN PUT ON YOUR HANDS

40:02.130 --> 40:04.098
TO SEE IF YOU'VE
TOUCHED HUMAN REMAINS.

40:04.100 --> 40:04.896
NO WAY.

40:05.660 --> 40:08.390
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TODAY ?

40:13.030 --> 40:15.089
WHO'S THAT ?

40:16.360 --> 40:18.726
THAT'S MY PARTNER.

40:18.730 --> 40:21.358
YOU BETTER BE GLAD
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MESS WITH HIM.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.420
THAT GUY'S INTO
SOME CRAZY-ASS SHIT.

40:24.430 --> 40:27.297
NOW EITHER YOU CAN TELL ME
WHERE YOU PUT THE FOOT

40:27.300 --> 40:30.292
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH
THAT CRAZY-ASS MOTHERFUCKER.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.794
( announcer's babble )

40:50.600 --> 40:53.091
BIG SHIRLEY !

40:55.900 --> 40:57.720
SHE WON !

40:57.730 --> 41:01.097
OH, GOD,
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.625
I WON 16 DOLLARS.

41:03.630 --> 41:05.427
I TOLD YOU
THIS WOULD BE FUN.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.489
HOW MUCH
DID YOU WIN ?

41:07.500 --> 41:09.718
I DON'T KNOW...
FOUR THOUSAND.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.459
FOUR THOUSAND WHAT ?

41:11.460 --> 41:12.791
DOLLARS.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.321
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

41:23.330 --> 41:27.027
I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH
A HAIRDRESSER LAST YEAR.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.398
YOU DID ?

41:31.400 --> 41:32.594
YUP.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.448
YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY

41:38.460 --> 41:41.224
I GOT LOVE
IN MY TUMMY

41:41.230 --> 41:44.620
AND I FEEL LIKE
LOVIN' YOU

41:44.630 --> 41:46.450
ARE YOU A CUP ?

41:46.460 --> 41:48.553
HOW MANY CUPS
ARE YOU ?

41:48.560 --> 41:50.221
I'M A LOAF OF BREAD.

41:50.230 --> 41:51.390
( phone )

41:51.400 --> 41:53.391
( Brenda's voice )
HELLO ?

41:53.400 --> 41:56.927
OKAY, TALK SLOWLY.

41:56.930 --> 41:58.955
( male rambling on phone )

41:58.960 --> 42:01.895
I'M GONNA SEE YOU
IN A FEW HOURS.

42:03.230 --> 42:05.596
SLOW DOWN...
SLOWER.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.522
( male yelling )

42:07.530 --> 42:09.452
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.291
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

42:11.300 --> 42:12.699
BRENDA ?

42:12.700 --> 42:14.395
What am I supposed to do ?
Where am I supposed to go ?

42:14.400 --> 42:16.095
JUST STAY THERE.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.624
I'LL CALL YOU
IN A HALF HOUR.

42:17.630 --> 42:18.426
Promise ?

42:18.430 --> 42:19.419
I PROMISE.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.592
WHO WAS THAT ?

42:22.600 --> 42:24.750
NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

42:25.660 --> 42:27.252
I GOTTA GO.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.649
BRENDA,
WHO WAS IT ?

42:30.600 --> 42:32.795
JUST SOMEONE ELSE,
OKAY ?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.256
JUST BACK OFF ?

42:34.260 --> 42:36.751
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.

42:36.760 --> 42:38.091
I'LL CALL YOU.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.955
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
STAYING IN TOWN.

42:54.660 --> 42:57.151
HE THREW IT
OUT OF HIS CAR ?

42:57.160 --> 43:00.027
HE WAS TAKING IT
TO SHOW SOME FRIENDS.

43:00.530 --> 43:03.124
THEN IT HIT HIM,
HE MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE,

43:03.130 --> 43:05.223
WELL, WITH PEOPLE NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BE IN POSSESSION

43:05.230 --> 43:06.697
OF OTHER
PEOPLE'S FEET.

43:06.700 --> 43:07.928
HE TOSSED IT OUT.

43:07.930 --> 43:09.158
I'VE GOTTA
GET HOME.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.196
JUST DROP ME OFF
AND I'LL PICK UP MY CAR LATER.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.122
ALRIGHT, I'LL TAKE A LOOK
WHERE HE SAID HE TOSSED IT.

43:13.130 --> 43:15.394
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.153
HEY, HOW CAN
I SLEEP, HUH ?

43:18.160 --> 43:20.424
KNOWING THAT THERE'S
A FOOT ON THE LOOSE ?

43:20.430 --> 43:23.627
YOU LOST $25,000,
IT'S JUST GONE ?

43:23.630 --> 43:25.621
I SUPPOSE
IT STILL EXISTS,

43:25.630 --> 43:27.450
IT'S JUST
NOT MINE ANYMORE.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.190
I'M WAITING
FOR AN EXPLANATION.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.225
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE A CHILD.

43:32.230 --> 43:33.629
I WAS ON A--

43:33.630 --> 43:35.427
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT,
A ROLL.

43:35.430 --> 43:37.523
SO I KEPT
BETTING MORE AND MORE,

43:37.530 --> 43:39.157
AND I JUST FELT SO GOOD,

43:39.160 --> 43:40.821
LIKE I WAS LIVING
SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE.

43:40.830 --> 43:42.593
I WAS UP $9,000 !

43:42.600 --> 43:44.693
AND THEN
I STARTED TO LOSE.

43:44.700 --> 43:47.794
AND THEN I STARTED
TO FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN.

43:47.800 --> 43:50.223
AND SO, I KEPT BETTING
MORE AND MORE,

43:50.230 --> 43:51.925
AND LOSING
MORE AND MORE.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.625
YOU SHOULD'VE
BEEN MORE CAREFUL.

43:53.630 --> 43:55.757
I DON'T WANT TO BE CAREFUL,
I WANT TO FEEL ALIVE.

43:55.760 --> 43:57.899
THERE SHOULD
BE A WAY TO DO THAT

43:57.900 --> 43:59.527
THAT'S A LITTLE
LESS EXPENSIVE.

43:59.530 --> 44:01.725
I HAVE A RIGHT
TO MAKE MISTAKES, NATE !

44:01.730 --> 44:04.927
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULDN'T BEGRUDGE ME THAT.

44:10.030 --> 44:11.850
WHAT ?

44:13.500 --> 44:16.719
I LOST $25,000,
OKAY, YOU GOT IT OUT OF ME !

44:16.730 --> 44:18.755
NOW LEAVE ME ALONE !

44:41.100 --> 44:42.192
HEY.

44:44.500 --> 44:45.797
CLAIRE ?

44:45.800 --> 44:48.121
YOU'RE DAVID'S FRIEND.

44:48.130 --> 44:49.358
KEITH.

44:50.530 --> 44:52.691
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

44:55.760 --> 44:57.296
NOT MUCH.

45:01.860 --> 45:04.158
( Nate )
SO, WHERE'S CLAIRE NOW ?

45:05.230 --> 45:07.323
WELL, I GOTTA SAY,
I'M TOTALLY RELIEVED...

45:07.330 --> 45:09.798
THAT I DIDN'T
LOSE IT.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.459
HEY.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.956
NICE JOB, RICO.

45:22.430 --> 45:23.727
THANK YOU.

45:23.730 --> 45:26.028
BOY, THEY DID
DO A MARVELOUS JOB.

45:26.660 --> 45:29.220
THEY OUGHT TO,
THEY CHARGED A FORTUNE.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.658
CAN I ASSIST YOU,
MISS ROMANO ?

45:39.660 --> 45:41.696
I KNOW IT'S SILLY,

45:41.700 --> 45:44.191
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SEE
WITH MY OWN EYES

45:44.200 --> 45:46.054
THAT POP'S
ALL PUT TOGETHER RIGHT.

45:46.060 --> 45:48.096
WE GET TO DO THAT,
DON'T WE ?

45:59.530 --> 46:00.394
GOOD.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.355
I THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP MUCH BETTER NOW.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.889
RICO, YOU GAVE HIM
A FOOT ?

46:24.900 --> 46:26.424
YEAH, YEAH.

46:26.430 --> 46:28.489
I THOUGHT IT WAS
FOR THE BEST.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.821
REMEMBER THAT LEG OF LAMB
THAT YOUR MOTHER HAD

46:30.830 --> 46:33.025
IN THE BACK OF HER FREEZER
FOR LIKE FOREVER ?

46:33.030 --> 46:34.190
OKAY, STOP.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.589
EMBALMED, WRAPPED
IN LATEX AND DUCT TAPE.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.091
I WAS FOLLOWING HIM HOME
TO GET IT BACK

46:39.100 --> 46:41.295
WHEN I SAW HIM
TOSS IT.

46:41.300 --> 46:43.996
NOW I'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS
AND I CAN'T FIND IT.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.059
DESCRIBE IT
TO ME AGAIN ?

46:46.060 --> 46:48.028
IT'S A FOOT.

46:48.030 --> 46:50.055
WHY DID YOU TAKE IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE ?

46:50.060 --> 46:51.652
WELL, AT THE TIME,

46:51.660 --> 46:54.527
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD WAY
TO PAY HIM BACK FOR SOMETHING.

46:54.530 --> 46:56.498
I JUST WANTED
TO SHAKE HIM UP.

46:56.500 --> 46:59.594
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW GUYS
CAN BE SO UNSHAKABLE.

47:00.730 --> 47:02.721
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.957
DID YOU EVER
SUCK A GUY'S TOE ?

47:11.560 --> 47:12.549
YEAH.

47:13.630 --> 47:15.996
ME TOO.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.057
HAVE YOU BEEN
WATCHING MRS. ROMANO ?

47:23.060 --> 47:24.891
YEAH.

47:24.900 --> 47:27.824
BEEN WATCHING HER
ALL NIGHT.

47:27.830 --> 47:30.492
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING ?

47:30.500 --> 47:32.855
CASKET CLIMBER.
CASKET CLIMBER.

47:32.860 --> 47:35.658
HER ? SHE DOESN'T
LOOK THAT EN ERGETIC.

47:35.660 --> 47:37.196
YEAH.

47:37.200 --> 47:40.055
THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT REALLY GO FOR IT.

47:41.460 --> 47:44.395
SO, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH RICO

47:44.400 --> 47:46.960
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH KROEHNER.

47:49.030 --> 47:50.019
OKAY...

47:51.260 --> 47:54.093
SO THERE WAS
NO BABY CHRISTENING
THE OTHER DAY.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.453
I LIED.

47:55.460 --> 47:57.758
BUT I ONLY TOOK ONE MEETING
WITH GILARDI.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.557
YOU MET
WITH HIM ?
WHY ?

47:59.560 --> 48:02.120
HEY, GILARDI
CALLED ME, OKAY ?

48:02.130 --> 48:04.325
I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO CONSIDER MY OPTIONS.

48:04.330 --> 48:07.254
MY FATHER PUT YOU THROUGH
MORTUARY SCHOOL.

48:09.860 --> 48:12.021
I WANNA GO
WITH YOU !

48:12.030 --> 48:13.349
MRS. ROMANO !

48:13.360 --> 48:15.191
WHOA, WHOA,
MRS. ROMANO !

48:15.200 --> 48:16.394
MOMMY !

48:16.400 --> 48:17.799
GRAB HER LEGS.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.290
IT'S OKAY,
HERE WE GO.

48:19.300 --> 48:21.291
HERE WE GO,
MRS. ROMANO.

48:26.700 --> 48:28.554
I GIVE UP.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.489
IT'S NOT HERE.

48:36.030 --> 48:38.021
THIS PROBABLY
ISN'T OVER.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.892
IF THERE'S A LESSON
TO BE LEARNED

48:43.900 --> 48:47.051
IT'S THAT YOUR ACTIONS
HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

48:47.060 --> 48:49.221
WELL, GABE SHOULD
LEARN THAT.

48:53.330 --> 48:56.595
I KNOW YOU AND MY BROTHER
ARE LIKE...

48:57.560 --> 48:58.754
GAY.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.222
OKAY.

49:07.760 --> 49:09.990
WHAT DO YOU
SEE IN HIM ?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.457
HE'S JUST DAVID,
YOU KNOW ?

49:12.460 --> 49:15.452
I KNOW,
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.653
HE IS SMART,

49:19.660 --> 49:22.026
HE'S KIND,
HE'S FUNNY.

49:23.060 --> 49:25.392
I KNOW HE CAN BE
A LITTLE UPTIGHT,

49:25.400 --> 49:27.721
BUT UNDERNEATH THAT
HE'S...

49:28.660 --> 49:31.049
SUCH A LITTLE BOY.

49:31.060 --> 49:32.550
IN NOCENT.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.596
AND I LIKE THAT.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.023
MOST OF THE MEN
I MEET,

49:37.030 --> 49:40.488
WELL, THEY KINDA JUST WANT ME
TO BE ONE THING.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.991
WHAT, LIKE,
BIG, BLACK SEX COP ?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.127
"SORRY I WAS
SPEEDING, OFFICER,

49:45.130 --> 49:47.394
I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO
PUNISH ME NOW."

49:47.400 --> 49:50.551
YEAH, AND I DON'T
WANT TO BE THAT.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.391
RENT A VIDEO.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.821
DAVID...

49:55.830 --> 49:58.048
HE GETS ME.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.597
WHEN SOMEONE SEES YOU
AS YOU REALLY ARE,

50:00.600 --> 50:03.524
AND WANTS
TO BE WITH YOU,

50:03.530 --> 50:05.452
THAT'S POWERFUL.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.091
WHATEVER.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.249
I WISH I COULD KNOW
THE DAVID YOU KNOW.

50:18.430 --> 50:21.251
YOU COULD BE
A LITTLE NICER TO HIM.

50:21.260 --> 50:23.899
HE'S UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS

50:23.900 --> 50:26.528
WITH THAT CREMATION PLACE
OPENING ACROSS THE STREET.

WHAT HE CAN DO

51:16.460 --> 51:18.348
