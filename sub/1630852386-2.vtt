WEBVTT

00:11.511 --> 00:14.681
<i>Mademoiselle!</i>
We just arrived. <i>Mademoiselle!</i>

00:14.764 --> 00:16.683
<i>Monsieur,</i> where are we?

00:16.766 --> 00:18.935
Sorry, <i>mademoiselle,</i>
I don't speak English.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.520
We arrived in Villefranche.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.022
Um…

00:22.105 --> 00:25.025
How do I get my bag?
It's really huge and tacky,

00:25.108 --> 00:26.526
and has a big face on it.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.902
With your chauffeur.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.122


00:39.831 --> 00:41.124
Camille! Hi.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.461
Hi, Emily.
What happened with Mathieu Cadault?

00:44.544 --> 00:47.297
-What do you mean?
<i>-I just saw his Instagram stories.</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.424
He was at Le Montana
with a bunch of models,

00:49.507 --> 00:52.010
and I thought you were going
to St Tropez together.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.638
Oh, uh, he decided
to stay in town last minute.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.682
I can't believe he stood you up.
Where are you?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.310
It's fine. He said
I could even keep the hotel room.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.771
So you're in St Tropez by yourself?

01:02.854 --> 01:05.440
Well, yeah, but I'm gonna
take the first train back

01:05.523 --> 01:07.442
as soon as I can find
the driver with my bag.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.194
Oh! Oh, there he is.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.654
<i>-Um, I'll see you back in Paris, okay?</i>
-Get in the car.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.782
-What?
-I'm coming down there.

01:13.865 --> 01:17.077
No! I mean, you don't have to do that.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.995
You already have a free hotel room,

01:19.079 --> 01:21.706
and St Tropez is a perfect place
for two single women.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.125
-Let's have fun?
-Camille, wait.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.377
Text me where you're staying. Bye!

01:26.461 --> 01:27.295


01:28.630 --> 01:29.464


01:31.633 --> 01:33.551


01:46.106 --> 01:47.398


01:48.775 --> 01:49.609


01:49.692 --> 01:50.527
Hello.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.655
Good morning.
Uh, I need you to come down to St Tropez.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.032
I'm sorry, I'm not into
three-ways with friends.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.244
I'm not here with Mathieu.
Camille is on her way down.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.579
Wait. What's going on?

02:01.663 --> 02:03.748
Bottom line,
Mathieu left me at the station.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.416
<i>-Oh.</i>
-The details are not important.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.962
What is important is I don't want
to be alone in St Tropez with Camille.

02:09.587 --> 02:13.216
I'm terrified I'm gonna blurt out,
"I slept with your boyfriend," at brunch.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.554
I told you, I am not
into three-ways with friends.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.471


02:18.555 --> 02:22.267
All I want is for Gabriel and Camille
to get back together. Okay?

02:22.350 --> 02:23.893
But I just need your help.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
<i>-Please come.</i>

02:25.687 --> 02:28.273
Okay, I'll call Camille
and see if I can get on her flight.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.151
Yes! Okay, thank you. I'll see you soon.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.027
I love you, see you later. Bye.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.881
<i>Merci.</i>

02:55.800 --> 02:59.304
Pierre Cadault!
Exactly what is the story here?

02:59.387 --> 03:01.431
I must, must, must know.

03:02.098 --> 03:05.518
Oh, my God. <i>Monsieur</i> Duprée. Emily Cooper.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.520
I'm such a big fan.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.397
So very many are.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.733
I work at Savoir, Pierre's marketing firm.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.360
It's a collab
we're considering with Rimowa.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.653
It's divine.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.073
You must take a photo of me with it.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.242
Must, must, must. Pierre will die.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.619
You know Pierre?

03:22.702 --> 03:23.661
Know?

03:24.370 --> 03:27.457
My pet, we spent nearly
a decade together in that atelier.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.709
Chain-smoking with our seamstresses,

03:29.792 --> 03:32.212
hand-beading Tilda's jumpsuits
for La Croisette.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.255
It was a time.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.717
Well, I mean, I guess
it could be good for brand engagement.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.429
<i>Oui, oui, oui.</i> And I will post it
for the whole world to see.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.432
Come. Let me sprawl.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.601
The glasses.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.688
<i>-Bonjour,</i> Pierre.
-Oh!

03:51.481 --> 03:54.275
Super sass. Yes. Yes!

03:58.029 --> 04:00.240
WELCOME MR. CADAULT

04:00.323 --> 04:01.282
Hmm.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.796
Hmm.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.543
-
-Hmm?

04:54.043 --> 04:56.671
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur</i> Cadault. Did you see it?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.215
Emily, you have
to take that photo down, now!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.175
-Why? It's doing great.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.928
Yes! But on Grégory's Instagram.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.347
-Why are you whispering his name?
-<i>Emily!</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:08.224
Are you really that clueless?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.977
Make it go away
before Pierre has a stroke!

05:12.812 --> 05:14.439
-Oh!

05:14.522 --> 05:15.773
Hey. Hey, Julien.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.443
Why is Grégory Elliot Duprée
sitting on Pierre's face?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.153
And why are you reposting it?

05:20.236 --> 05:23.531
Why is everybody freaking out?
A celebrity liked the bag.

05:23.614 --> 05:27.243
<i>Paris Match</i> even picked it up.
Okay? This is good.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
This is a nightmare!
Grégory is Pierre's nemesis.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.289
What? Oh, my God.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.125
Maybe I should DM Grégory.
I got off the phone with Mathieu.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.503
No. Don't do anything!
It's illegal to work on weekend in France.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.089
Okay, well, now you're
just being dramatic.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.735
Hello. How are you?

06:00.818 --> 06:03.404
I'm in St Tropez.
I want to stop by that club

06:03.488 --> 06:05.907
we sent a couple of cases of Champère to.
What was it called?

06:05.990 --> 06:10.036
No, you know, we're not allowed
to answer work calls on weekends.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.704
-At Savoir?
-No, in France.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.414
-That's absurd.
-That's the law.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.250
Okay, well, what was it called? Florian D?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.045
<i>Non,</i> Laurent G.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.924
But, Emily, you go to St Tropez
to party, not to work.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.635
It's like going to Ibiza to do your taxes.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.345
Well, why can't I do both?

06:27.428 --> 06:31.307
Look, I'm already here, okay?
Not stopping by would be ridiculous.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.725
<i>No, Emily, wait. Emily!</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:38.898
Uh, excuse me.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.775
<i>Oui?</i>

06:41.943 --> 06:44.237
Um, where is the Champère on the menu?

06:44.320 --> 06:47.281
Uh, it's written right here.
Look. Champagne.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.492
No, Champère.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.912
-Is there a problem?
-Are you the manager?

06:52.995 --> 06:53.913
I am Laurent.

06:53.996 --> 06:57.041
Oh, my God! Laurent G!
Oh, God, it's so nice to meet you.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.044
I'm Emily C. From Savoir.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.003
<i>You</i> work at Savoir?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.798
Yes. I was trying to get
a bottle of the Champère we sent you,

07:03.881 --> 07:05.550
but it's not even on the menu.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.845
Um, bring a bottle
of that garbage from the basement.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.639
Who sent you?

07:11.722 --> 07:13.349
No one. I just happen to be in town.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.727
I thought I'd come by and see
how the Champère promotion was going.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.272
Nice to meet you.
Do you speak French?

07:19.355 --> 07:20.523
I'm learning, but, uh…

07:20.606 --> 07:22.150
slowly.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.902
An American at Savoir.
How interesting.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.697
-Oh, yes, well, it definitely has been.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.782
So, I'm in town with the Champère client.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.702
I'd love to bring her here,
see how you're promoting the brand.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.747
I'm sorry, we're very full tonight,
but you're welcome to stand at the bar.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.417
Champère.

07:41.794 --> 07:45.173
No! No, you're supposed to spray it.
Not drink it.

07:46.382 --> 07:50.052
Well, that explains the taste.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.640
May I give a tutorial to your staff
on how to present the product?

07:54.724 --> 07:55.808
By all means.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.519
I will leave you to your, uh, work.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.520
Okay.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.316
-I need your help.
-Okay.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.487
<i>-Comme ça.</i>
-<i>Comme ça.</i>

08:07.570 --> 08:09.822
And then, film me. Okay.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.075
Hold on. Back, back, back.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.119
Um, okay. Spray away!

08:34.430 --> 08:35.431
Sylvie?

08:40.061 --> 08:40.937
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

08:42.021 --> 08:43.481
Wow.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.858
-We need to take a photo.
-Another one?

08:45.942 --> 08:47.485
-Okay.
-Yeah, another one.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.820
-I'm going to take this, okay.
-Thanks.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.822
-Cheese! Perfect.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.241
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.742
<i>Bonjour.</i>

08:54.825 --> 08:56.827
<i>Bonjour.</i> Welcome
to Grand Hôtel du Cap Ferrat.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.371
-Passports, please.
-Sure.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.998
-This, oh, no, that's… No. Mmm-hmm.
<i>-Merci.</i>

09:01.082 --> 09:03.042
-There you go.
-Thank you.

09:03.125 --> 09:07.004
So we have a reservation
under the name of Cooper or Cadault.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.048
-Here you are. Thanks.
-Thank you.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.592
-Here you are, Ms. Chen.
<i>-Merci beaucoup.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:13.803
Let me know
if there's anything I can do for you.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.806
I recommended restaurants
that your father enjoyed

09:16.889 --> 09:18.015
when he stayed with us.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.475
Um, my father was here?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.811
<i>Oui.</i> Two weeks ago, I believe.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.896
Oh.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.358
Right, two weeks ago.
Yeah. I… Of course I knew that.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.777
-Thank you very much, <i>madame.</i>
Thank you. Have a nice day.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.579
-Emily!
-Emily!

09:39.662 --> 09:40.997
Oh, my God!

09:41.080 --> 09:43.291
Yay! Hi! How was your trip?

09:43.374 --> 09:46.043
So fun. Hold this, please.
I'm going to pee. Bye.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.795
Hey.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.756
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.717
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.220
Yeah, I'm wiped out.
She's been on one since I picked her up.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.223
She keeps posting stories non-stop,

09:59.307 --> 10:01.976
and then checking to see
who's viewed them every five minutes.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.937
She wants to know if Gabriel's
seeing them. That's a good thing.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.648
She also told me ten times
about some hot art dealer

10:07.732 --> 10:10.359
and some gorgeous Italian
who always flirts with her,

10:10.443 --> 10:13.446
so I think she just wants
to get laid, like, now.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.574
Oh. No. This is supposed
to be like a fun girls' trip.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.075
-Uh…
-Okay? No boys allowed.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.662
-So by the time she gets back to Paris--
-They'll get back together.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.666
You'll have magically unslept
with her boyfriend.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.377
So what are we doing?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.964
I visited the beach club
that's selling your family champagne,

10:32.048 --> 10:35.718
and it's super fun,
so I thought that we could get dinner

10:35.801 --> 10:38.304
and then go there after
for a little promo.

10:38.387 --> 10:43.726
-Sweet. But we're not here to work, right?
-Mmm. No. No. Yeah. Mmm.

10:43.809 --> 10:48.105
Okay, guys, there is a collector
who has an amazing house in the hills.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.400
-He throws legendary soirées.
-But we've got a dinner reservation.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.694
-Are you talking about the Ragazzi house?
-Yes!

10:53.778 --> 10:56.072
There is a coffee-table book
about those parties!

10:56.155 --> 10:58.783
Or we could do brand promotion.
That's fun too.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.035
There is no way.
We're going to that party.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.580
There is only one way
to get a guy out of your system.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.874
-You have sex with another one. Yeah!
-Exactly!

11:13.130 --> 11:15.925
Uncle,
this is Julien from Savoir.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.512
I'm not receiving visitors.
I am very fragile right now.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.306
<i>Monsieur</i> Cadault, I would like to
apologize for this mistake.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.349
Mistake?

11:24.975 --> 11:28.312
This was a calculated attack.
He knew exactly what he was doing.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.065
Everyone knows.
But Emily is new to the luxury world.

11:31.148 --> 11:33.275
She had no idea
about your feud with Grégory.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.362
She is very good at grabbing attention,
but she hasn't grasped

11:36.445 --> 11:39.323
the delicate relationships
we have to navigate in the fashion world.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.034
Well, then someone needs
to get a grasp of her

11:42.118 --> 11:45.121
before she ruins the Cadault name forever.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.874
Where is the statement
renouncing that imbecile?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.377
Our publicist is already
speaking to <i>Paris Match.</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:54.505
-That's a bad idea.
-So was that post.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.716
And the luggage.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.302
Really? Emily said
you quite liked the bag.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.347
I said it was fun. Cheesy.

12:03.431 --> 12:07.184
Well. Perhaps we needn't drown
the entire brand in cheese, right?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.188
Tell me why I shouldn't respond.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.607
Your rival still wants a piece of you.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.819
Grégory doesn't look triumphant,
he looks desperate.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.696
For now.

12:18.779 --> 12:22.575
But if you react,
you look defensive and small.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.745
Get me a table at the Ritz.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.456
We need to think. The three of us.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.043
-Are you coming?
-Uh, yes!

12:43.471 --> 12:45.765
-Camille, <i>ma chérie.</i>
-Rocco!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.184
You're gorgeous.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.518
I'm so happy to see you.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.937
So,
those are my friends, Emily and Mindy.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.441
Thank you so much for having us.
Your house is amazing.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.151
It's just like the book cover.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.779
Except Tom Hardy isn't doing yoga
on the diving board.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.490
Uh, Romain!

13:02.573 --> 13:04.575
-Come here, big guy.
-Yes, what's up?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.786
Romain, this is Camille. Camille, Romain.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.288
<i>-Bonsoir.</i>
-Romain is visiting from Milan.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.624
<i>-Enchanté.</i>
<i>-Enchantée.</i>

13:13.125 --> 13:15.211
Has Rocco showed you
the new Hockney already?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.963
-It's in the game room.
-You got another Hockney?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.467
-You have an addiction, you know that?
-I know. I know. I know.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.554
-Sorry.
-Sure.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.642
Um, hey, uh, Romain? Romain.

13:29.725 --> 13:30.559
-Yes?
-Hi.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.812
Um, would you snap a photo of us?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.647
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay, thank you!

13:36.023 --> 13:37.149
Okay…

13:37.233 --> 13:38.484
Ready?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.653
-On three. One, two-- Oh.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.655
Someone's calling. Who's Gabriel?

13:42.738 --> 13:44.782
-Gabriel is calling you?
-Must be a butt dial.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.867
-Decline it.
-Yeah. Let's go.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.036
Okay, I do it again. One, two…

13:49.119 --> 13:51.622
-He's calling again.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.581
Uh!

13:52.665 --> 13:54.959
I don't know the guy,
but I think he really wants you.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.544
-No, he doesn't!
-He does.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.463
-Just answer it!
-Okay! Okay. Hello?

14:00.589 --> 14:04.009
-Why is Camille with you in St Tropez?
-Oh, yeah, no, she's right here!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.719
We're on a little girls' weekend.

14:05.803 --> 14:06.804
He's asking about you.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.889
-I think he saw your stories.
-Hmm.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.475
I thought you were going with Mathieu.
Did something happen?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
-Did you wanna talk to her?
-No.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.979
No, and why won't you talk to me?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.232
-It's really loud in here!
-Emily…

14:18.315 --> 14:21.235
Sorry, I'll talk to you
when we get back to the city. Okay? Bye.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.072
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.534
Just don't mention
his name again. All right?

14:28.617 --> 14:31.829
-Yeah, no, deal.
-I want to see the Hockney.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.998
-Sure. Right this way.
-Thanks.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.292
-We'll just come with you!
-Stop Hock-blocking.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.252
They're not gonna do it in the game room.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.880
Come on, we both need a drink.
<i>Où est le</i> bar?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.095
Thank you, sir. Good night.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.098
Boom! Guess who just got us
a table at Laurent G's?

14:51.181 --> 14:54.226
Ugh, I'd be losing my mind
if you weren't here.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.519
Thank you for coming.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.313
Please, if I knew we'd end up here,

14:57.396 --> 15:00.065
I'd have shoved Mathieu Cadault
off that train myself.

15:00.816 --> 15:01.984
Hey! There's Camille.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.906
Hi!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.490
-Hey!
-Hey!

15:08.574 --> 15:10.409
Are you good? Do you want a water?

15:10.492 --> 15:12.995
No! I want to dance with my friend.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.622
Okay, I'll get us another round.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.499
I'm sorry Gabriel stuck you
in the middle of us.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.251
-Uh, I don't believe he call--
-No.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.212
Remember? That's not allowed.
We can't say his name tonight.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.965
Oh, right, right, right.
Oh, fuck, that sax is flying!

15:34.516 --> 15:35.935
Whoa!

15:43.609 --> 15:48.489
Oh. Oh, hey! Um, do you know how long
it takes for us to get an Uber up here?

15:48.572 --> 15:51.951
I wanna make sure
we get to Laurent G's at peak hours.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.577
You want to go? Now?

15:54.286 --> 15:57.039
All right. Uh… Will you meet us there?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.707
-Of course I will.
-Ahem.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.753
See you later. Bye.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.172
Um, okay, what's going on with that guy?

16:05.255 --> 16:07.633
I don't know yet.
But he's really hot, right?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.009
I mean, yeah, kind of,

16:09.093 --> 16:11.887
but I don't want you to
do anything you're gonna regret.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.891
Oh, Emily. My sweet, concerned American.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.895
It's just sex.
It can't hurt anybody, right?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.731
-It may seem that way--
-Who the hell was the guy in the pool?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.442
-We're leaving, okay?
-Okay.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.403
-What? Oh, that was mine.
-Come.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.781
-Thanks, babe.
-Okay then.

16:44.461 --> 16:47.214
Oh, wait, no, sorry, that's not our brand.

16:47.297 --> 16:49.174
Um… I said Champère.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.759
-Oh, let's dance.
-All right.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
-No, please, Camille.
-See you later.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.555
Miss, what would you like?

16:54.638 --> 16:55.639
Um…

16:56.890 --> 16:59.184
-Never mind, I'll get this myself.
-Okay.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.520
-Be right back.
-Yeah, I'll take this one.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.113
Um…

17:11.822 --> 17:15.117
Excuse me. Excuse me!
I'm with the owner of Champère tonight.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.286
It'd be really nice
if we could get a few bottles

17:17.369 --> 17:19.705
of her family champagne
like I promised her.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.418
Oh, my God!

17:25.210 --> 17:26.920
Sylvie, look, I can explain.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.090
What would you like to explain first?
Why you were bothering Laurent

17:30.174 --> 17:32.384
with a shipment
he received only yesterday?

17:32.468 --> 17:35.137
Or why you offended Pierre Cadault?

17:35.220 --> 17:37.598
I was trying to promote the Rimowa piece.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.309
Yeah, and you dragged
a third client into this.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.978
What happened with Mathieu?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.271
It didn't work out.

17:44.354 --> 17:48.567
He literally jumped off a moving train
to get away from me. But it's fine.

17:48.650 --> 17:52.488
Yeah, if it were fine, he'd be here,
and not at the Ritz with Julien.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.031
What's Julien doing with Pierre?

17:54.114 --> 17:55.491
Cleaning up your mess.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.242
But I told him that I would fix it.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.869
Stop trying to fix everything.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.038
You're just making more work
for everyone else.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.706
On a weekend, which is illegal.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.501
-Why does everyone keep saying that?
-Because it's true.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.420
I just came here to introduce myself.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
They didn't even have
Champère on the menu.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.675
Camille is in town. I wanted
to make sure we were taking care of her.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.260
Of our client.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.970
So that's what this is about?

18:17.679 --> 18:21.683
You're gonna have to live with
the consequences of your infidelity.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.686
Emily, that's life. That's the way it is.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.606
Okay, I'm sorry.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.859
I'll apologize to Laurent,
and then I'll go.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.444
No, I'll handle Laurent.

18:32.528 --> 18:37.199
No, it's my mess. You don't need to flirt
with that dirtbag just to save my ass.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.245
Emily, that dirtbag is my husband.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.664
You're married?

18:44.414 --> 18:45.791
To Laurent G?

18:47.751 --> 18:48.752
For how long?

18:50.754 --> 18:53.132
Oh, my God, it's G as in "Grateau"?

18:59.054 --> 19:02.015
How has no one mentioned
she's been married this whole time?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.059
That's bizarre, right?

19:07.104 --> 19:08.897
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.233
It's so stupid.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.570
Aw, is that you and your dad?

19:14.653 --> 19:18.031
Yeah. He used to take me here
to get a Tarte Tropézienne.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.283
Aw.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.118
Back when we were still talking.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.166
Em, he was here a few weeks ago.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.169
The concierge told me.
He didn't even text me.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.253
What?

19:31.920 --> 19:36.341
My God, I'm sorry, that's awful.
Why didn't you say anything?

19:36.425 --> 19:37.801
Well, what is there to say?

19:38.594 --> 19:41.138
I know part of this is my fault,

19:41.221 --> 19:44.641
but even when we were fighting,
he'd always check in.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.227
Now, I feel like
he doesn't even want to try anymore.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.271
I mean, you could text him.

19:49.855 --> 19:54.526
And say what? Something insane
like, "I miss you. I wish you were here."

19:54.610 --> 19:56.486
I mean, is that really so crazy?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.698
Okay. I'm sorry.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.491
Don't listen to me.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.162
I mean, at this rate,
even I wouldn't listen to me.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.056
Uh…

20:51.458 --> 20:52.292
Hey.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.586
Can I sit?

21:02.469 --> 21:03.929
Pretty great, huh?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.598
-It's Jean Cocteau.
-It's amazing.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.519
I brought Gabriel here once
to show him the art.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.773
But when we arrived, there was a wedding.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.858
Very small. With just a few people.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.403
They invited us to stay,

21:19.486 --> 21:22.322
and we spent the day
celebrating with them.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.034
It was the first time
he told me he loved me.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.914
Camille. What is it?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.250
I went home with Romain.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.378
That's not the end of the world.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.132
I mean, like you said,
it's just sex. Right?

21:42.009 --> 21:44.303
Yeah. I know I've said that, but…

21:45.846 --> 21:46.888
I didn't.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.057
I couldn't.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.811
I'm still in love with Gabriel, Emily.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.314
And I'm afraid I've lost him.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.401
You haven't, Camille.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.653
No, I know you haven't.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.753
<i>Bonjour.</i>

22:18.420 --> 22:20.797
Emily. Hello again.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.633
I just came here to apologize.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.844
I should never have bothered you.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.847
No worries. You're welcome any time.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.974
For fun. Not for work.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.642
-Thank you.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.645
I hope I didn't complicate things
with you and Sylvie.

22:35.729 --> 22:39.316
I had no idea that
you two were… acquainted.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.111
We have endured far worse
in more than 20 years.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.907
What was she like back then?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.785
She was fun. And wild.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.413
She would sleep all day.
Stay up all night.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.291
And she always had
a bikini in her purse, just in case.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.837
I… I cannot imagine that.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.632
But it wasn't enough.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.760
She wanted a career,
so she moved to Paris.

23:06.843 --> 23:07.886
Her accent changed.

23:08.595 --> 23:09.596
She changed.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.601
-She reminds me a bit of you.
-No, you should not tell her that.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.895
Or that I was here.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.689
It might be too late.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.492
Go. I'll take care of her.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.676
Hey, isn't this your tarte place?

23:48.260 --> 23:49.886
Oh, yeah, I guess it is.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.805
You could've said you wanted to come here.

23:51.888 --> 23:54.224
-I wanted lunch by the water, that's it.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.059
While we're here, do you want a photo?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.979
-Fine, I guess.
-Okay.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.940
Say, "Tarte Tropézienne!"

24:02.023 --> 24:03.650
I'm not saying that!

24:05.986 --> 24:07.571
Bet he'd love to hear from you.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.824
You're right. I shouldn't let him
get away with this.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.201
-Busted, bitch.
-Not what I had in mind.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.327
REMEMBER US HERE?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.496
-Mmm.
-Right. Not my problem to fix.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.414
I MISS YOU DAD.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.666
Okay, so let's find a place to sit, yes?

24:19.749 --> 24:23.044
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the grande dame of Instagram.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.215
And if it isn't the liar
who almost cost me my job.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.717
Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.969
But Pierre savaged
my first show for Balmain,

24:31.052 --> 24:33.889
and when I saw his fat face
on the side of that suitcase,

24:33.972 --> 24:35.765
I decided to give him a review of my own.

24:35.849 --> 24:39.186
Oh, well, we need to get on a yacht
before we leave St Tropez.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.855
Sorry. No girls allowed.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.148
Get on the boat.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.528
You owe me.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.364
Welcome aboard.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.038
So, ladies, how was your weekend?

24:58.121 --> 25:01.625
-I got ghosted by my own father.
-I almost lost my job.

25:01.708 --> 25:05.378
I had a crazy weekend with my friends,
and that was exactly what I needed.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.671
Thank you both.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.632
Oh.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.675
-This champagne tastes like ass.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.052
Your favorite flavor!

25:12.135 --> 25:14.179
Because it's supposed to be sprayed.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.305
Oh!

25:19.017 --> 25:19.935
Oh, my God.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.940
Oh, the gay spray of St Tropez.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.776
-That's your campaign!
-I love that!

25:29.277 --> 25:30.445
Um…

25:31.196 --> 25:36.368
No, never mind. I'll post it later.
I'm on vacation.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.786
Yes, bitch!
