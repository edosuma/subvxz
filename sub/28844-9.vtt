- Still makes me sad.

01:37.896 --> 01:40.137
How'd it go?

01:40.206 --> 01:43.068

make up with them.

01:43.137 --> 01:46.137
There's no stopping it now.

04:12.689 --> 04:14.586
Could be a stroke
initiated by the trauma.

when we move cows,

04:49.689 --> 04:51.517

all the fucking cows,

please.

Get dressed.

18:19.793 --> 18:21.310
I went to high school with you.

18:23.827 --> 18:27.586
And you, you babysat
her husband.

18:27.655 --> 18:30.137
- On her driver's license,
her last name is Long.

18:30.206 --> 18:31.517
- I doubt that's gonna
save you, buddy.

18:31.586 --> 18:33.103
- Let's go.

18:40.448 --> 18:42.517
- Thank you.

18:42.586 --> 18:45.344
- Wait. Don't go.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.482
You'll miss all the fun.

18:52.586 --> 18:55.413
Well, I'm here.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.000
Might as well shop.

19:02.827 --> 19:04.586
Oh, that's nice.

19:14.689 --> 19:17.827
Nah. Not for me.

19:21.862 --> 19:24.586
And you.

19:24.655 --> 19:27.241
You fucking cunt,

19:27.310 --> 19:29.517
I remember when you
gave out hand jobs

19:29.586 --> 19:32.620
for lunch money, Veronica.

19:32.689 --> 19:37.517
That was before the boob job

19:37.586 --> 19:39.586
and the dermabrasion

19:39.655 --> 19:41.413
and the doctor dumb enough
to marry you.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.689
That's lovely.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.862
Model it for me, would you?

19:59.482 --> 20:02.448
Oh, I think we're well past
dressing rooms, don't you?

20:02.517 --> 20:04.379
Try it on here.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.344
You know, it's not
a "have to," Veronica.

20:08.413 --> 20:10.965
I can just
keep smashing shit.

20:18.620 --> 20:19.655
Try it on.

20:43.379 --> 20:45.896
Ooh.

20:45.965 --> 20:48.586
Spanx.

20:48.655 --> 20:51.310
What a shocker.

20:51.379 --> 20:55.275
You know you had an ass like a
12-year-old boy in high school,

20:55.344 --> 20:57.275
What happened?

21:01.448 --> 21:04.000
Now we're getting somewhere.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.379
Well, you're not a real blonde.
What a surprise.

21:16.448 --> 21:18.034
- Stop.

21:18.103 --> 21:21.793
Doing it to her doesn't
undo what she did to me.

21:24.448 --> 21:28.034
I didn't steal from you.
And you know it.

21:28.103 --> 21:29.965
You judged my skin.
Just say it.

21:32.310 --> 21:34.896
- I judged your skin.

21:34.965 --> 21:36.103
I'm sorry.

21:54.551 --> 21:57.000
- You're lucky
she has a conscience.

21:57.068 --> 21:59.655
I was gonna get you
to fuck that mannequin.

22:04.655 --> 22:06.862
[chuckles]

22:06.931 --> 22:10.000
I could've done this
all fuckin' night.

22:10.068 --> 22:12.379
Oh, well.

22:12.448 --> 22:15.000
Guess there's always tomorrow.

22:29.655 --> 22:32.620
Why don't we go somewhere.

22:32.689 --> 22:34.896
Get a drink,
wind down for a bit.

22:34.965 --> 22:37.482
- I don't drink.

22:37.551 --> 22:40.896
- Then you can watch me.
C'mon.

22:58.275 --> 23:00.551
- They're all staring.

23:00.620 --> 23:02.758
- Let 'em.

23:02.827 --> 23:05.448
- Doesn't bother you--
what they're thinking?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.896
- They're probably thinking
some asshole

23:09.965 --> 23:13.137
worked off his twelve pack
on my face.

23:13.206 --> 23:15.689
And they're not wrong.

23:20.689 --> 23:22.000
You know, I certainly understand

23:22.068 --> 23:25.586
why he fought so hard for you.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.413
You have a kind soul.

23:28.482 --> 23:32.000
The whole world can see it.

23:32.068 --> 23:35.172
Some of the world's
gonna hate you for it.

23:35.241 --> 23:38.724
Today was probably more
about that than anything.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.655
She looked at you, and she...

23:45.689 --> 23:49.827
Younger, prettier...

23:49.896 --> 23:52.793
Better.

23:52.862 --> 23:56.896
And she fuckin'
hated you for it.

23:56.965 --> 24:00.000
Willing to hurt you for it.

24:00.068 --> 24:03.551
Well, she's the one hurting now.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.793
And you--you'll forget
about her in a few weeks,

24:06.862 --> 24:10.655
but she'll never forget you
forgiving her.

24:10.724 --> 24:14.965
That's gonna haunt that bitch
for the rest of her days.

24:15.034 --> 24:17.275
- Haunting her wasn't my goal.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.655
- That's why it will.

24:28.689 --> 24:31.758
You know, Kayce isn't like you.

24:31.827 --> 24:34.068
His center isn't set,

24:34.137 --> 24:36.517
you know what I mean.

24:36.586 --> 24:39.551
He has the potential
to be just like my father.

24:39.620 --> 24:42.965
And you owe it to Kayce
and your son

24:43.034 --> 24:44.620
to do everything in your power

24:44.689 --> 24:46.206
to prevent that from happening.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.517
My mother was the...

24:56.482 --> 25:00.068
My mother was the spine
of this family.

25:03.241 --> 25:05.310
She was the center.

25:05.379 --> 25:08.413
Without her, he's...

25:08.482 --> 25:12.206
Well, the best of him
died with her.

25:12.275 --> 25:14.862
And the same thing will happen
to Kayce when you leave
him again--

25:14.931 --> 25:17.103
and you will leave him again.

25:17.172 --> 25:20.758
You're too good for this place.

25:20.827 --> 25:23.448
You're too good for this family.

25:23.517 --> 25:25.724
But the next time you leave,

25:25.793 --> 25:28.758
you take Kayce with you.

25:31.137 --> 25:33.103
Okay?

25:33.172 --> 25:36.034
'Cuz he's too good
for it, as well.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.000
- Mr. Dutton?

25:57.068 --> 25:58.551
- Yep, over there.

26:09.862 --> 26:12.344
- Why do that?
Why ride them in circles?

26:12.413 --> 26:14.517
- Just keeping 'em fit.

26:14.586 --> 26:15.862
Last little bit of training

26:15.931 --> 26:17.689
before they're turned out
for winter.

26:17.758 --> 26:19.965
- My daughters want horses.

26:20.034 --> 26:21.586
- There's an old saying
out here:

26:21.655 --> 26:23.862
"If your daughter's
riding a horse,

26:23.931 --> 26:25.482
no one's riding her."”

26:25.551 --> 26:27.482
- [laughs]

26:30.862 --> 26:33.034
- So beautiful.

26:33.103 --> 26:34.655
Every direction.

26:34.724 --> 26:37.000
It's just like a painting.

26:37.068 --> 26:38.379
All I wanted was

26:38.448 --> 26:41.551
give people an opportunity
to see it, you know.

26:41.620 --> 26:43.103
In New York, pick the direction

26:43.172 --> 26:44.793
no matter where you look,

26:44.862 --> 26:46.689
you can't find the horizon.

26:46.758 --> 26:49.482
At night, the sky is purple.

26:49.551 --> 26:51.310
No stars.

26:51.379 --> 26:53.482
The noise is constant.

26:57.206 --> 26:59.896
Nobody's from Montana, John.

26:59.965 --> 27:01.896
We're all immigrants.

27:01.965 --> 27:03.689
I have just as much
right to be here as you.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.137
As Rainwater.
As anybody else.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.137
- No one has a right.

27:08.206 --> 27:11.034
You have to take the right.

27:11.103 --> 27:14.206
Or stop it from
being taken from you.

27:14.275 --> 27:15.482
- Buy me out, John.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.758
Buy the club,

27:16.827 --> 27:19.344
turn it into a landfill.
Whatever you want.

27:19.413 --> 27:23.344
- I don't have the money.

27:23.413 --> 27:27.034
I'm not a rich man, Dan.
Contrary to popular belief.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.482
I would if I could.

27:28.551 --> 27:30.551
For both of us.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.655
But I can't.

27:33.724 --> 27:36.206
And I can't let
you sell it either.

27:36.275 --> 27:38.758
Then it's someone else
building something else.

27:38.827 --> 27:40.275
At this point,
you're the devil I know.

27:40.344 --> 27:41.551
And I'm stuck with you.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.517
- You can't stop me
from selling, John.

27:44.586 --> 27:47.655
- Dan, you haven't learned
a goddamn thing, have you?

27:52.172 --> 27:55.103
- So...

27:55.172 --> 27:58.620
enemies by Monday again, huh?

27:58.689 --> 28:00.275
- We're enemies now.

28:05.241 --> 28:07.379
- I suppose we are.

28:26.724 --> 28:29.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:31.896 --> 28:33.655
- Tate in bed?

28:33.724 --> 28:37.586
- I think he's being
grandfathered.

28:37.655 --> 28:40.310
- I swear he gets
more affection in one day

28:40.379 --> 28:41.965
than we got in our
entire childhood.

28:42.034 --> 28:43.103
- That's not funny, Kayce.

28:43.172 --> 28:44.448
That's something
you should examine.

28:44.517 --> 28:47.310
Closely.

28:47.379 --> 28:48.793
Where you headed?

28:48.862 --> 28:51.551
- I got some more work to do.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.241
- You know, I grew up
on a ranch, too.

28:53.310 --> 28:56.034
I don't remember so much of
the work being done after dark.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.655
- Baby.

28:59.724 --> 29:03.172
I can't do this right now.

29:03.241 --> 29:07.068
- Does it make you happy,
this work you're going to do?

29:07.137 --> 29:08.620
- No.

29:08.689 --> 29:09.620
- But you have to.

29:09.689 --> 29:12.586
To protect the ranch.

29:12.655 --> 29:15.000
- Yeah.

29:15.068 --> 29:17.655
- Know what you need, baby?
You need a different ranch.

29:17.724 --> 29:19.482
- Can't afford
a different ranch.

29:19.551 --> 29:22.068
- I don't think you can
afford to stay on this one.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.275
In here.

29:27.758 --> 29:29.551
- Can we talk
about this tomorrow?

29:29.620 --> 29:31.275
- If we'll really talk about it.

29:31.344 --> 29:32.413
- We will, okay?

29:32.482 --> 29:34.379
We'll talk about it.

29:34.448 --> 29:36.724
I promise.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.448
- Rip, can I have a word?

29:54.517 --> 29:55.758
- Now's not the time.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.172
- I want to go with you.

29:59.482 --> 30:01.931
- No, you don't.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.172
- I'm already in
this place so deep.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.068
- He wants you clean.
You carry a badge.

30:09.137 --> 30:12.517
- The badge hasn't
kept me clean.

30:12.586 --> 30:15.068

30:15.137 --> 30:17.275
it's all the way in.

- Ryan. Ryan.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
What are you doing?

30:46.758 --> 30:49.620
- He doesn't wear the brand.

30:49.689 --> 30:51.068
- He will.

30:58.931 --> 31:01.172
- Where are you going?

is knowing when
to quit an outfit.

And if you had a lick of sense,
you'd quit it, too.

31:28.206 --> 31:30.034

You don't want that
ice cream to melt, do ya?

39:34.689 --> 39:35.758
- Alone?

39:35.827 --> 39:37.241
You let him come
down here alone?!

39:41.413 --> 39:42.896
- No one's alone on this ranch.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.931
There's a dozen
wranglers down here.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.827
Or there's supposed to be.
Where the hell have you been?

39:46.896 --> 39:48.655
- Oh please.
Argue about it later.

39:48.724 --> 39:50.551
Let's just find him.

39:52.448 --> 39:54.517
- Tate?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.586
- Tate!
- Tate.

40:03.103 --> 40:06.517
- Tate?
- Tate!

40:06.586 --> 40:09.000
- Tate?

40:50.448 --> 40:52.137
- What is this?

41:02.551 --> 41:04.827
Did any of you drive back here?!

41:07.344 --> 41:08.862
- No sir.

41:41.172 --> 41:42.344
- What?

41:44.206 --> 41:45.344
What is it?

41:56.379 --> 41:57.931
- [screams]
