WEBVTT

00:15.515 --> 00:18.601
Whoa!

00:30.530 --> 00:32.907
What? Time travel?

00:38.747 --> 00:39.581
What?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.293
Excuse me?

00:57.849 --> 01:01.686
What even is any of this?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.444
Who are you?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.170
Where are we?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.172
<i>Toronto, Canada.</i>

01:30.715 --> 01:32.092
When are we?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.301
<i>The future.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:38.848
And you're...

01:38.848 --> 01:40.183
Scott Pilgrim.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.416
Whoa!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.377
Wow.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.297
Wow!

03:34.923 --> 03:37.759
So we actually make it past 25!

03:37.759 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, man.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.720
We might even
make it to 40 if we're lucky.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.180
This is wild!

03:42.180 --> 03:43.640
So what's up with us?

03:43.640 --> 03:47.435
Are we rich and famous?
Do we win a lot of cool fights?

03:47.435 --> 03:49.062
We do okay.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.981
The fact that we can grow a beard alone.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.566
Very impressive.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.236
Finally, somebody appreciates it.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.141
Whoa!

04:27.141 --> 04:28.726
We live here?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.103
No way!

04:30.103 --> 04:33.022
Yes way. Here, let me show you our house.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.863
Whoa!

04:42.865 --> 04:43.741
Hey!

04:50.290 --> 04:52.041
This place is so cool!

04:52.041 --> 04:54.919
It's just... Was there a reason
you brought me here?

04:54.919 --> 04:58.006
Because I was kind of
in the middle of fighting some dude.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.801
He said he was part of
some kind of hockey league.

05:02.635 --> 05:07.098
The League of Evil Exes.
That takes me back so many adventures ago.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.975
That's right, evil exes.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.811
- Whatever happened with that?
- Well, let me break it down for you.

05:11.811 --> 05:16.441
Fighting those exes was
the biggest mistake of our entire life.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.526
- Because we lost?
- No.

05:20.862 --> 05:21.946
Because we won.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.533
Come on, I'll show you.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
Whoa! VR?!

05:29.412 --> 05:33.082
- You have virtual reality in the future?
- Yeah, we have it all.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.252
The future's more futuristic
than they originally predicted.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.589
- You're gonna love it here!
- I am? For how long?

05:55.521 --> 05:58.775
<i>Welcome to the VR chamber.</i>

05:59.275 --> 06:01.444
Wow!

06:01.444 --> 06:03.571
"Wow!"

06:03.571 --> 06:06.699
When did Knives Chau get here? Come on.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.796
Give this one a spin.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.144
Me and Ramona?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.687
How did you do this?

06:36.687 --> 06:39.482
It's so easy.
I paid some nerd on the Internet.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.235
That's that one guy. I know him.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.531
This is the league, eh?
They don't look so tough.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.658
That guy just skateboarded to his death.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.619
They're chumps. Seven deadly chumps.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.996
Wait, is that our ex?

06:53.996 --> 06:55.498
What's she doing here?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.417
Do we have to confront
our past or something?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.960
Because that sounds terrible.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.254
I'm telling you,
the whole thing was terrible.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.755
And for what?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.383
You punched a girl in the boob?

07:05.383 --> 07:08.052
Circumstances beyond my control.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.390
So Ramona dated a robot.
That's progressive.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.143
No, she dated the Twins. They're humans.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.310
What is this?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.312
Another red flag, pal.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.815
I don't see any flag, and it's all red.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.026
No, it's a figure of speech. God!

07:25.570 --> 07:27.029
We get married?

07:27.029 --> 07:29.365
This is really sweet, actually.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.785
And a honeymoon in Florida! I love it!

07:32.785 --> 07:36.706
Yeah. I met Optimus Prime!
Optimus f****** Prime.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.126
This is a really nice project, man.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.210
Is that...

07:41.210 --> 07:43.379
That's not part of it anymore.
Ignore that one.

07:43.379 --> 07:47.717
I told them to take that out. Next screen.
The next one is what's important.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.224
Now this one looks like
it's in a completely different style.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.519
Now what are you talking about?
It's the exact same, if not better.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.981
No. It's definitely worse.
Whoever did this is bad at art.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.277
So we're divorced?

08:06.277 --> 08:08.946
Well, technically we're separated.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.698
Man! When?

08:11.199 --> 08:16.037
After the honeymoon.
A few... Twelve, 13 odd years later. Yeah.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.749
Years! What?
We must have had some good times.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.543
Sure. But those aren't in the simulation.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.005
Back to the tour.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.468
I haven't even mentioned the band.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.311
Sex Bob-Omb is still going? Cool!

08:40.811 --> 08:43.606
Sex Bob-Omb? No, ancient history.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.317
I'm talking about my new band,
Pop'n TwinBee.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.487
The members are me and the Twins.
Thus, the name.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.365
You didn't catch that?
I told you about the Twins, though, right?

08:52.365 --> 08:56.077
The twins who dated Ramona?
Yeah, like a minute ago.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.621
- You said we defeated them.
- Yeah. Duh.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.624
We kicked their ass.
But after they respawned at home,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.501
I guess they learned
their lesson or whatever.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.087
You know, sometimes,
bad guys turn into great guys.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.964
You'll learn that on a later adventure.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.632
Check out our new video.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.974
It's a bop, right? Over a hundred views!

10:00.516 --> 10:02.643
Hundred and five, actually.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.650
Hey, why is all of Old Wallace's
old stuff in our garage?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.110
"Our" garage?

10:12.737 --> 10:16.157
When I said "our house,"
you thought I meant me and you.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.702
Knock, knock. You boys want some iced tea?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.955
Two Scotts. Yikes.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.874
Nobody mention <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.959
- It's not what it looks like.
- <i>Sonic the Hedgehog?!</i>

10:38.012 --> 10:41.182
How can Old Wallace
afford such a big house? No offense.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.686
None taken. I can't afford it.
It's kind of a sugar daddy situation.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.146
Sugar what?

10:50.191 --> 10:51.984
- My husband is--
- Don't.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.611
Well, it's not a secret.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.571
He's not ready.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.989
I haven't prepared him.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.616
He's gonna find out one way or another.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.951
All right.

11:00.951 --> 11:04.246
I didn't want to do this so soon,
but he's right.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.417
Somebody needs to tell you.
Wallace's husband...

11:08.417 --> 11:09.752
works at Nintendo.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.589
Where they make the video games?
- Yes.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.508
Does he get every game for free?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.385
- Yes.
- He doesn't. That's not true.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.262
It's true. They get every game for free.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.516
I knew it!

11:24.517 --> 11:29.188
Well, Wallace, I'm really happy for you.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.942
Oh please! You're seething with jealousy.
Get your own husband.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.780
<i>Scott Pilgrim is refreshed.</i>

11:37.780 --> 11:40.282
So why do we live here, Old Me?

11:40.282 --> 11:45.371
I thought when we grew up, we'd, you know,
no offense, stop living with Wallace?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.623
None taken. This is temporary.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.209
We're just crashing here
while we figure stuff out.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.711
Stuff with Ramona?

11:51.711 --> 11:55.089
Not everything is about Ramona, okay?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.174
But, yeah, obviously, stuff with Ramona.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.301
And where's Old Wallace's husband?

11:59.301 --> 12:02.012
- He's at work.
- Is that where he is?

12:02.012 --> 12:04.348
Yeah. I guess he's been there
for a few weeks then?

12:04.348 --> 12:05.599
What are you insinuating?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.727
I mean, I'd stay there too.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.396
Young Scott, shut up. You're not helping.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.856
I'm regular Scott.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.274
He's Old Scott.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.984
Fine. Regular Scott, shut up.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.319
Old Scott, why is there
a younger you in my kitchen?

12:19.196 --> 12:22.074
What do you mean? This was your idea!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.200
I'm sorry?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.411
Yeah. When me and Ramona
were having problems,

12:25.411 --> 12:28.080
you said,
"Too bad I don't have a time machine

12:28.080 --> 12:30.958
so I can go back and stop myself
from dating her in the first place."

12:30.958 --> 12:33.711
Buddy, I was obviously joking.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.338
Well, now you tell me.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.256
For real?

12:37.923 --> 12:40.259
How the hell did you get
a time machine in the first place?

12:40.259 --> 12:42.261
That technology
hasn't even been invented yet.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.892
Hey, you guys are smart, right?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.519
Do you think time travel is possible?

12:55.024 --> 12:56.776
He's retired, but...

12:56.776 --> 13:00.279
if Robot-01 was disconnected
from the space-time continuum,

13:00.279 --> 13:03.616
he would experience the entire duration
of his existence simultaneously.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.497
- Which would mean...
- In theory, at least.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.332
...sure, yeah, time travel.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.750
Kids' stuff. Easy.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.755
Was that seriously the end of the story?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.215
Wait a second.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.885
You brought me to the future
so I wouldn't fight the exes?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.637
So I wouldn't date Ramona?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.597
What? No!

13:26.597 --> 13:30.893
I just wanted someone to play two player
side-scrolling beat-'em-ups with, dawg.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.395
- I don't think that's it.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.273
Yeah, I took you away
from Ramona on purpose.

13:36.273 --> 13:40.528
See, I used to have a heart.
It was right here.

13:40.528 --> 13:46.575
Now it's gone because she tore it out
and she rollerbladed all over it.

13:46.575 --> 13:50.788
Now it's all smooshed and broken
and covered in rollerblade tracks.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.416
Hey, I'm sure you two can work it out.

13:54.416 --> 13:59.338
Or you can tell me what you did wrong,
and I can go back and do a better job.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.925
You immediately assume I messed up!

14:02.925 --> 14:04.593
But I'm a good husband.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.513
I do the dishes,
I walk the cats, I make the spaghettis.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.308
And I won't take you back to the past
until I know for a fact

14:11.308 --> 14:13.602
that you won't date Ramona Flowers.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.147
Because she is the one who's bad news!

14:17.147 --> 14:18.315
Not us!

14:24.196 --> 14:27.074
Is Old Me okay?

14:27.074 --> 14:29.743
Remember how you were
after Envy Adams dumped you?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.413
It's like that times ten.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
Oh no.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.711
Life's a funny thing.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.462
I'm sure not where I expected to be

14:40.462 --> 14:43.048
when I woke up
this morning in Ramona's bed.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.800
But it's not all bad, I guess.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.927
Hey, I'm Scott, by the way.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.681
Didn't I see you at The Rockit?
Back at our show in the past.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.559
I know that was a while ago for you,

14:53.559 --> 14:56.604
but did you happen
to get any of that on video?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.651
You record video of everything?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.738
Like "everything" everything?

15:18.083 --> 15:20.210
Let's start with the moment I left.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.308
Video games rule!

16:31.448 --> 16:32.324
What the--

16:34.410 --> 16:36.245
Stop! We come in peace!

16:43.627 --> 16:47.339
Sorry about this.
He kept asking to see you. Very annoying.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.341
Anyway, he's your problem now.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.219
Hold it. You're not going anywhere.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.557
I heard about Old You's
idiotic time travel plan.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.891
Sort of thought it was a joke.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.936
Convince himself
to stop being obsessed with me?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.521
Has he met himself?

17:02.521 --> 17:04.898
That's why I came up with a backup plan.

17:04.898 --> 17:08.527
A few years ago,
one of your dumb friends wrote a memoir.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.696
<i>"Scott and Ramona and Me."</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:13.949
<i>"My Precious Big Life
as Scott Pilgrim's Best Pal."</i>

17:13.949 --> 17:15.909
"By Old Young Neil."

17:17.703 --> 17:21.415
I read it. Decent love story.
Could have used more Wallace.

17:22.750 --> 17:27.046
"Scott and Ramona loved each other
very, very, very, very, very much."

17:27.629 --> 17:29.506
If Old Scott was gonna erase everything,

17:29.506 --> 17:32.926
I wanted there to be some way
for you to discover our story.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.097
So I sent it back in time.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.932
You have a time machine too?

17:39.725 --> 17:41.977
They're made out of parts
from an old DeLorean.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.481
When I hit 88 miles per hour,
I travel through time.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.192
I don't know what that is in kilometers.

17:48.192 --> 17:51.987
Okay. I get the plan in theory,
except Scott doesn't read books.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.865
Yeah, but I thought of that.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.535
<i>So I moved some scenes around,
combined a few characters,</i>

17:58.535 --> 18:02.122
<i>and before I knew it,
I had a tight little screenplay.</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:12.007
So you thought Old Me would convince
this me that Young You was bad news

18:12.007 --> 18:14.593
and he'd send me back home
and we'd break up.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.762
And then one day,
I'd be at my local cineplex

18:16.762 --> 18:18.806
and see a preview
for a movie about myself--

18:18.806 --> 18:19.765
Okay.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.643
The plan may have been misguided. I just...

18:24.228 --> 18:25.270
I had to try.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.066
I mean, he's the love of my life.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.902
Then it wasn't misguided.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.488
Scott, the plan was a disaster.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.741
The movie fell apart, careers ended.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.785
That's not the story I saw.

18:51.713 --> 18:55.384
<i>I saw a story about you. Or another you.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:57.136
<i>The Ramona I left.</i>

18:57.136 --> 18:59.179
She was looking for me.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.640
Looking for answers, never giving up.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.142
Like that famous detective.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.353
- Columbo?
- I was gonna say Detective Pikachu.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.147
But Columbo, exactly.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.774
Your Ramona sounds pretty cool.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.276
So cool.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.821
Well, then we better make sure
she gets what she wants.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.953
Goodbye, Old Wallace. Love the new hair.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.329
Call your husband.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.958
I agree, looks hot.
And you should call your husband.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.043
Don't tell me what to do.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.212
But thank you. I do look hot.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.565
Hey, baby, miss me? How's work?

19:55.819 --> 19:57.863
So that's why you're steaming.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.865
Wait, is Future Me here?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.410
I was just gonna drop him off,

20:03.410 --> 20:06.330
but figured I'd stick around
long enough to say hi.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.457
Well, hi.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.585
I gotta get a picture of this.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.928
Hey,

20:20.928 --> 20:22.554
this is yours, right?

20:23.388 --> 20:24.223
Thanks, Knives.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.021
While we're talking, FYI, I met someone.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.314
So I've gathered.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.608
I'm really sorry.

20:34.608 --> 20:38.862
I probably should've told you sooner.
It all just happened so fast.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.657
And maybe this isn't the best time
to have this realization,

20:41.657 --> 20:45.452
but I probably shouldn't have been
dating you in the first place.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.955
Apparently, a 23-year-old
dating a high schooler

20:47.955 --> 20:50.249
is frowned upon by society.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.629
Scott, I'm glad you're alive...

20:56.797 --> 20:58.924
but I'm also glad you died.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.344
It gave me a lot of space
to reflect and grow.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.680
So thanks!

21:06.265 --> 21:07.099
Anytime.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.608
You're back! You're actually back.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.361
Yeah. It's... Yeah.

21:33.041 --> 21:33.875
What the...

21:41.216 --> 21:42.801
Wow! That really sucks.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.763
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for laughing.

21:47.597 --> 21:50.392
It must mean there's unfinished business.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.144
Emotional business.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.397
<i>Can I get a witness?</i>

21:55.397 --> 21:56.356
Stop.

21:56.356 --> 22:00.777
I hate to say it, but what if
I still have to fight your exes?

22:00.777 --> 22:02.988
I don't know, pal. A lot has happened.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.532
How much did you see
on that futuristic VR thingy?

22:05.532 --> 22:08.994
- I'm pretty much caught up.
- Then you know the game has changed.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.620
But the players are the same.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.374
So we track my exes down.
One by one, again.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.626
Wait!

22:16.626 --> 22:20.422
What if there was somewhere you could find
all the exes gathered together

22:20.422 --> 22:24.134
at the same time
to celebrate musical theater!

22:55.457 --> 22:57.209
Hey, you. Hi

23:35.622 --> 23:36.623
Whoa!

23:37.207 --> 23:39.668
Todd Ingram, the former vegan?

23:39.668 --> 23:42.254
Never heard of him. I'm a solo act now.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.631
Of course, we're here to celebrate
my dead roommate's life,

23:44.631 --> 23:47.342
but why not cast me? I'm a triple threat.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.303
<i>Why'd you have to go
And make things so complicated?</i>

23:50.303 --> 23:52.180
Yeah, Scott was my brother.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.265
He's alive?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.309
Well, then I guess
I should say Scott is my brother.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.318
Everyone have their tickets?

24:09.739 --> 24:12.159
Then it's time for the big finale.
