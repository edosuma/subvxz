Good morning. Can I help you?

03:26.164 --> 03:29.374
Yes, we are looking for
the rental agent.

03:29.459 --> 03:34.421
- We have an appointment with him.
- I'll just give him a little buzz.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.733
- Do you ever use that?
- This?

03:54.817 --> 03:57.986
No, never had it out of the holster.
A rival company has them,

03:58.071 --> 04:01.865
so we've got to have them.
It's just an advertising gimmick.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.257
Mr Merrick is coming.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.145
Welcome to Starliner Towers.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.524
- And you are?
- Kresimer and Benda Sviben.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.361
Ah yes, Mr and Mrs Sviben.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.281
Now, are we talking about
one or two bedrooms?

04:42.365 --> 04:44.950
I assume we're not talking
about bachelors.

05:36.878 --> 05:41.923
Now, Benda,
you take a look at this one

05:42.008 --> 05:45.469
and tell me if that doesn't suit you
right down to the ground.

05:45.553 --> 05:49.723
This is the one with the big view.
The panoramic view.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.440
- Did you say something, Nick?
- No.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.819
Breakfast is just about ready.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.716
Can I call you at the office?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.262
What do you want to call me
at the office for?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.765
I don't know.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.476
I just thought
I might like to call you.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.231
I'm not going to be at the office,
except to sign in.

08:44.315 --> 08:49.319
I've got claims to check out.
Garages and more garages.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.595
We're going up.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.222
Well. I'll just take a little ride.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.227
As I was saying,
we have quite an exciting variety

10:04.312 --> 10:07.188
of completely furnished apartments
ready and waiting.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.775
You could almost move in
this afternoon, if you wanted.

10:24.081 --> 10:27.334
Notice how the entranceways
to all the apartments...

11:05.081 --> 11:09.501
Annabelle, it's Nick.
Are you in the bedroom?

11:35.277 --> 11:37.153
It's probably nothing at all.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.573
Actually, it's probably some form
of fatty cyst or something like that

11:40.658 --> 11:42.742
that could easily be removed
at the doctor's office.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.203
Hasn't Nick seen a doctor?

11:46.914 --> 11:50.166
He hates doctors.
Doctors and lawyers.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.335
He never goes to doctors.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.423
Look, why don't you do this. Go down
to the clinic and see that nice doctor.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.634
What's his name? St. Luc?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.595
Go down to the clinic
and explain to him that Nick is very ill

12:02.680 --> 12:06.182
and he has to stay in bed.
Ask him to come and see him.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.562
And then when he's there
they can fight it out between them.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.314
- He'll be really mad.
- So what?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.192
You can relax. You'll find out
what's wrong with him.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.861
Let him be the uptight one
for a change.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.947
Really, this is ridiculous.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.617
OK.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.786
Bravo!

12:49.935 --> 12:52.937
Nicholas!
I didn't expect you in today.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.900
I've been telling everyone
to call back tomorrow.

13:02.072 --> 13:05.241
It was Dr Hobbes
who paid the rent on the apartment.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.620
But actually it was her name
that appeared on the residency list

13:08.704 --> 13:11.039
and on the intercom board.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.041
Annabelle Brown.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.921
A very civilised young lady.
Never complained about anything.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.465
That was her? Annabelle Brown?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.009
Without a doubt.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.637
This is the man who called you up here?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.473
Yes, the doctor, Roger St. Luc.

13:28.557 --> 13:33.144
He's the director
of our little medical clinic here.

13:33.229 --> 13:37.690
- Medical clinic?
- Yes. We're on an island, you see.

13:37.775 --> 13:41.069
We have to be
as self-supporting as possible.

13:41.153 --> 13:45.156
OK. Let's have a talk to the doctor.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.534
Dr St. Luc?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.746
Dr St. Luc?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.295
Dr St. Luc?
Detective Sergeant Heller, homicide.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.464
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.425
- You're the one who found the bodies?
- Yes.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.095
Did you touch or move anything
before we arrived?

14:07.179 --> 14:10.557
I removed some surgical tape
from the girl's lips.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.853
I examined the inside of her mouth.
I gave the tape to your detective -

14:14.937 --> 14:19.107
the man over there with the canvas bag.
And I looked at the abdominal wound.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.777
Yes, well, the department will be
getting back to you about that.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.822
Now, you knew these people?

14:25.906 --> 14:29.826
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor
and a professor at the university.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.287
I saw the girl around the building.
I didn't know her.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.831
She never came into the clinic.

14:34.915 --> 14:38.877
So you came to visit this man Hobbes,
and you found them like that?

14:38.961 --> 14:43.506
No. I haven't seen Dr Hobbes
since medical school.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.134
He taught me.
He was my professor at university,

14:46.218 --> 14:48.261
in urology and venereology.

14:48.345 --> 14:52.932
He also conducted some seminars in
psychopharmacology. That's about it.

14:53.017 --> 14:57.604
I never really had any idea he ever set
foot in Starliner Towers until today.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.564
What brought you up here?

14:59.648 --> 15:02.275
He called me
at six o'clock this morning.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.027
Hobbes called me.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.322
I thought I was dreaming.
I haven't heard that voice in so long.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.282
He said,
"Meet me at apartment 15..."

15:09.366 --> 15:11.618
...11.
- Thank you.

15:11.702 --> 15:15.997
"At noon we go out for lunch.
It's time you furthered your education."

15:16.081 --> 15:18.249
How did he sound?
Depressed? Nervous?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.835
He sounded fine.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.924
1511?

15:27.217 --> 15:30.762
No, you've got the wrong man.
Just a moment please.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.472
Dr St. Luc, it's for you.

15:32.556 --> 15:37.226
Someone wanting to know
why didn't you turn up for lunch.

15:39.563 --> 15:43.316
I know it is not the kind of lunch
that Hobbes had in mind for us,

15:43.400 --> 15:47.528
but it's all I got.
Isn't it beautiful?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.615
This is Hobbes' and my project.

15:50.699 --> 15:57.330
What we were trying to find
was an alternative to organ transplant.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.624
Am I keeping you up?
You're bored, right?

15:59.708 --> 16:03.544
To you, organ transplant
is just yesterday's kishkas, right?

16:04.505 --> 16:08.549
Look. You've got Man, right?

16:08.634 --> 16:13.680
And you've got parasites that
live in, on and around Man. Right?

16:13.764 --> 16:20.728
So, why not breed a parasite
that can do something useful?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.984
A parasite that can take over
the function of a human organ.

16:26.068 --> 16:32.031
For example, you breed a parasite that
you implant in the human body cavity.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.200
It hooks around
the circulatory system

16:34.284 --> 16:37.453
and it filters the blood
just like a kidney does.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.623
It takes a little blood for itself
once in a while. What do you care?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.543
You've got enough.
You can afford to be generous.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.754
- Huh? Are you following me?
- I am, I am.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.091
Look, you've got a guy
with a bad kidney. Right?

16:50.175 --> 16:53.302
You put the bug in him.
The bug goes to work on the kidney,

16:53.387 --> 16:56.806
dissolves it, so the body assimilates it.
Now, what have you got?

16:56.890 --> 17:00.893
You've got a perfectly good parasite
where you used to have a rotten kidney.

17:00.978 --> 17:05.231
Right? I know you're going to say.
You're going to say it's crazy.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.692
Actually, I was going to ask
if you have any mustard.

17:07.776 --> 17:11.070
Come on Roger, really.
What do you think?

17:11.155 --> 17:15.533
- I think it's crazy.
- It's crazy, but who cares?

17:15.617 --> 17:19.454
I mean, look,
Hobbes was a lousy teacher.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.833
We've got to face the facts of life.
He was dull, academic, just plain lousy,

17:23.917 --> 17:29.338
but he had a genius for one thing...
that was getting grants.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.507
He could raise money
for crazy projects.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.720
For example, who do you suppose
is paying the rent on this place?

17:35.804 --> 17:37.722
- Not you.
- No.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.558
The Northern Hemisphere
Organ Transplant Society.

17:40.642 --> 17:45.313
That's for something that's supposed
to put them out of business.

17:45.397 --> 17:53.196
Here is a partial list
of some of the other research projects

17:53.280 --> 17:57.950
that we are underwriting,
but with their money. Smart?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.415
Ashen and Gaunt
Insurance Appraisals.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.167
Mr Tudor?

18:08.003 --> 18:10.421
One moment, please.
I'll buzz him.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.612
Nicholas? There's a call for you.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.869
It's that man whose Lamborghini
caught fire on St Catherine.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.163
He's very angry.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.544
Nicholas? What's wrong?

18:57.511 --> 19:01.139
We're going to get you to a hospital.
It's probably an ulcer.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.349
- I'm going home for the day.
- But Nicholas...

19:03.433 --> 19:08.771
I'm all right, Mona.
Call me a cab... Now.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.734
All right, Nicholas.
All right.

19:23.745 --> 19:28.124
How did Hobbes know this girl?
Who is she?

19:28.208 --> 19:32.128
Some chick he met while
he was lecturing at a girls' school.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.713
And what happened?

19:33.797 --> 19:37.675
They caught him examining
her titties for breast cancer

19:37.759 --> 19:40.219
in the faculty lounge.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.472
She was 12 years old.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.185
Talk about crazy.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.563
He used to bring her up here
once in a while.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.526
I'll never understand
how he could do what he did to her.

20:01.617 --> 20:07.788
Well, I think I'm going to have
to go back and open up the store.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.083
It's been great seeing you.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.710
Roger?

20:12.794 --> 20:16.964
You'll think about what I just talked
to you about? About joining me on this?

20:17.049 --> 20:21.969
- Sure.
- See you. Right.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.848
How about the pickle?

20:26.808 --> 20:29.393
It's used!

20:50.165 --> 20:52.541
Good afternoon, Mr Tudor!

20:55.796 --> 20:58.881
...that the ageing process
is in any way reversible.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.134
I don't think for a moment that it is,
but it might be stoppable,

21:02.219 --> 21:04.595
and that's where
mega-vitamins come in.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.014
Mrs Tudor? Are you ready now?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.267
- Yes. Excuse me, Brad.
- Sure.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.894
- Be with you in a minute.
- Right.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.889
No, I don't see any change

21:48.974 --> 21:52.601
in this company report
I did on your husband last year.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.896
I see a few too many escargots

21:55.981 --> 21:59.191
and too many crepes with
vanilla ice-cream and strawberries

21:59.276 --> 22:01.694
and a dash of Grand Marnier.

22:01.778 --> 22:06.407
I don't see any chance of any cancer
developing. Not like you're describing.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.661
I think it might be some
swollen glands or something.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.581
Can you come up
and take a look at him?

22:13.665 --> 22:15.624
That's what I'm here for.

22:15.709 --> 22:20.004
I don't think I can do it until about 9:30
or 10 o'clock. Is that OK?

22:20.088 --> 22:21.714
- That's terrific.
- Not too late?

22:21.798 --> 22:24.759
That's fine.
Thank you so much, doctor.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.178
- Don't worry about it.
- OK.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.058
Mrs Emmenthal is ready, doctor.

22:32.142 --> 22:35.603
Tell Mrs Emmenthal
I'll be right with her, will you?

24:11.241 --> 24:14.618
- You see how beautiful the grass is?
- Yes.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.711
I take a walk nearly every day.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.345
Good heavens! Look!

24:36.808 --> 24:40.102
Oh, poor birdie.

24:40.187 --> 24:44.023
They're always crashing
into tall buildings.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.442
The windows fool them, you know.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.528
- Come along, Olive.
- It's such a shame.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.990
- Come along, dear.
- The poor little bird.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.663
Maybe it's only hurt.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.667
Don't be silly, dear.
It's in heaven now, whatever it is.

25:04.544 --> 25:09.256
Now come along. I'll get you tucked
into bed before the colour TV.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.134
You know what a restless...

25:18.016 --> 25:20.351
Kriedler seemed to think
that the mega-vitamin therapy

25:20.435 --> 25:22.603
is the answer
to the question of ageing.

25:22.687 --> 25:26.148
That's not to suggest that the ageing
process is in any way reversible.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.860
- They're ready for you now, Brad.
- OK. Bye.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.661
Now, you just take your shirt off

25:38.745 --> 25:41.497
and the doctor will be in
to see you in a minute, OK?

25:41.581 --> 25:43.958
You don't have to go.
I'm not shy.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.210
Now, don't be a tease, Brad.

25:46.294 --> 25:49.672
- I'm still working, you know.
- Yes, I know.

27:23.266 --> 27:26.518
Looking good. Put your feet up.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.522
Let's see what the problem is.

27:35.278 --> 27:39.615
Ow! Better take it easy.
There's a lot of pressure in there.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.996
Do you want me
to breathe deeply?

27:46.081 --> 27:48.999
Not just yet.
Just breathe normally.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.672
Good shape
for an old man, eh?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.256
Yes.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.176
Better than me, my man.
Better than me.

28:00.095 --> 28:06.809
Erm... Mr Parkins, I understand that
you got these lumps from a young lady.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.977
Is that right?
What makes you think that?

28:09.062 --> 28:11.105
She had some just like them.

28:11.189 --> 28:16.068
Right here. Near her belly button.
You could push them around too.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.405
I thought it was kind of sexy, myself.

28:19.489 --> 28:24.827
- Did she live in the Starliner Tower?
- Yes. In 1511.

28:24.911 --> 28:27.663
- Annabelle Brown?
- Yeah, that's the one.

28:31.501 --> 28:36.422
OK, I tell you what,
put your clothes on.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.052
I'm going to send you
to the hospital to take a few X-rays.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.847
I'm going to give you
a little piece of paper,

28:44.931 --> 28:49.351
- right here with the address.
- Are they going to cut me open?

28:49.436 --> 28:54.565
I don't want you thinking
you've got a problem when you don't.

29:09.956 --> 29:11.957
Hi.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.348
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.977
- Want a drink?
- No thanks.

29:32.061 --> 29:35.189
I just wanted to tell you,
Dr St. Luc is going to come and see Nick

29:35.273 --> 29:37.024
about 10:00.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.902
That's terrific!
Was he nice to you?

29:39.986 --> 29:43.113
- Mm-hm.
- Great.

29:43.198 --> 29:47.701
After you've found out that there's
nothing that a vacation won't cure

29:47.786 --> 29:50.329
why don't you come
and join me for dinner.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.040
Everything from Filipe's.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.793
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Why don't you come and join me?

29:55.877 --> 30:00.839
I loathe to eat alone.
It makes me feel so fat and lonely.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.634
- I always order for two.
- OK.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.707
Nick? Are you home?

30:59.023 --> 31:03.151
Come on, sweetheart. We'll get
you into bed. You'll be all right.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.529
Come on.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.624
Come on.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.554
You go there and I'll go here.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.563
Forget it.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.024
I don't understand
why there's no-one home here.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.984
Maybe in that apartment.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.407
What is it?

31:50.491 --> 31:52.576
It's sickening! What is it?

31:52.660 --> 31:55.704
Let's get out of here!

33:09.946 --> 33:12.739
Come on, boy.

33:14.742 --> 33:17.035
Come on, buddy.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.042
Come on, fella.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.801
You and me.

33:37.098 --> 33:39.766
You and me,
we're going to be good friends.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.104
Good friends.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.114
Attaboy!

34:04.751 --> 34:07.669
'Nick? Did you call me? '

34:07.754 --> 34:10.338
Did you say something?

34:25.938 --> 34:28.356
How are you feeling?

34:33.738 --> 34:36.239
Does your stomach hurt?

34:39.535 --> 34:43.080
- Can I feel those lumps on your tum?
- Go away.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.335
Leave me alone.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.804
Why won't you
let me help you?

35:42.098 --> 35:44.766
'The time is seven o'clock.

35:44.851 --> 35:49.062
'This is John Woodhouse with
Mediascope news, sports and weather.

'Olympic construction has been

37:03.471 --> 37:05.555
I got those things you asked for.

37:05.640 --> 37:12.103
The files on Horsfield, Velakofsky,
Swinbird and Brown.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.815
And those papers published
by Hobbes and...

37:15.900 --> 37:19.945
Those are from
the American Journal of Psychiatry.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.364
- All of this.
- Yes, this is Hobbes' paper.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.951
As an extra, these are some things
that were compiled

37:26.035 --> 37:31.081
before your time here.
I thought they might be of interest to you.

37:31.165 --> 37:34.042
And now how about a kiss?

37:36.337 --> 37:40.382
- Hey, how about a kiss?
- Sure.

37:40.466 --> 37:44.844
That's the best thing I heard all day!
How about another kiss?

37:44.929 --> 37:48.348
- Do we have more people on the list?
- No, Dot is the last.

37:50.184 --> 37:54.145
- Yes?
- Rog? It's me, Rollo.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.147
Interesting you should call.

37:56.232 --> 38:01.695
I'm just looking over this material
you did with Hobbes. It's interesting.

38:01.779 --> 38:05.240
'That's flattering but I don't think
you'll find much real meat on them.'

38:05.324 --> 38:08.368
- No? How come?
- 'I always thought Hobbes was funny,

38:08.452 --> 38:13.081
'But I told you that before. Right?
I just never knew how funny, until now.

38:13.165 --> 38:17.294
'So when he kicked off, they sent
all his personal notes and stuff.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.379
'After all, I'm his partner, right? '

38:19.463 --> 38:23.174
Anyhow, I've been going through his
papers and what it adds up to is this:

38:23.259 --> 38:25.302
Hobbes was shafting us all.

38:25.386 --> 38:29.097
Me, the university, the foundations,
the council, everybody.

38:29.181 --> 38:34.436
- I don't quite get it.
- Hobbes believed that "man is an animal

38:34.520 --> 38:37.647
"that thinks too much.
An over rational animal

38:37.732 --> 38:40.900
"that has lost touch with its body
and its instincts." How do you like that?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.528
'In other words, too much brain
and not enough guts.

38:43.612 --> 38:46.031
'So what he came up with
to help our guts along

38:46.115 --> 38:49.200
'was a parasite that's...

38:49.285 --> 38:52.829
'... a combination of aphrodisiac
and venereal disease

38:52.913 --> 38:57.208
'that will hopefully turn the world
into one beautiful, mindless orgy.'

38:57.293 --> 39:02.297
Well, I think it sounds
a little crazy to me.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.133
Look. The important thing
to you, Rog, is this.

39:05.217 --> 39:09.012
You know Annabelle?
Well, he was using her as a guinea pig.

39:09.096 --> 39:12.098
- 'A guinea pig? '
- He implanted her with a parasite,

39:12.183 --> 39:15.518
and once it took over,
apparently she went berserk.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.521
I guess Hobbes wasn't
ready for that,

39:18.606 --> 39:21.149
- so I guess he just had to kill her.
- 'What was the point? '

39:21.233 --> 39:25.612
Well, the point was...
he wasn't trying to burn her.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.572
- 'He wasn't? '
- No.

39:27.656 --> 39:31.743
He was trying to burn the things.
All of them.

39:31.827 --> 39:34.329
- Yeah, well, he didn't make it.
- What?

39:36.165 --> 39:39.292
Maybe Hobbes didn't know,
but Annabelle Brown was a popular girl

39:39.377 --> 39:42.504
around Starliner Towers.
I've got three men here, maybe four,

39:42.588 --> 39:46.549
hosting large, free-moving, apparently
pathogenic, abdominal growths

39:46.634 --> 39:49.594
that nobody I've tried can identify.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.847
'Listen, I'd like to come over
and take a look at those guys.'

39:52.932 --> 39:57.477
Well, why don't you?
I'm going to meet one of them soon.

39:57.561 --> 40:02.107
A fellow by the name of Tudor.
It's on the directory there.

40:02.191 --> 40:05.151
You can just meet me
up at the apartment.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.903
'Yeah, look, I'll be right over.

40:06.987 --> 40:10.740
'Listen, Rog, I don't want
to panic you or anything,

40:12.118 --> 40:15.620
but the way Hobbes
designed those things,

40:15.704 --> 40:18.540
they get out of hand pretty fast.
So you've got to be careful,

40:18.624 --> 40:21.751
before you even have a chance
to know what's happening to you.

40:21.836 --> 40:26.005
Once they start pumping that juice into
the blood stream, well, I don't know...

40:26.090 --> 40:29.759
The point it, if you see anybody
doing anything compulsive,

40:29.844 --> 40:32.720
you know, any kind of
bizarre sexual things, well...

40:32.805 --> 40:36.057
'once we can get at them,
there are a lot of things we can use.'

40:36.142 --> 40:40.562
Maybe we'd start with a kind of
basic tropical kit and work up from there.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.939
I'll bring a bag full over,
but the point is,

40:43.023 --> 40:45.442
you've got to get at them.
And fast.

42:12.696 --> 42:17.075
Listen, I'm going to stay. I've got
to meet Rollo at the Tudor apartment.

42:17.159 --> 42:20.286
- It's going to be pretty late.
- Why don't you come to my place

42:20.371 --> 42:22.664
for something to eat
when you're finished?

42:22.748 --> 42:24.832
It's going to be very late...

42:24.917 --> 42:28.878
It doesn't matter to me
how late it is. I'll keep it warm.

42:28.963 --> 42:32.674
Is anything wrong?
I mean, with the Hobbes thing?

42:32.758 --> 42:35.593
Yeah. But nothing we can't handle.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.887
Well, how about supper
at my place?

42:37.972 --> 42:41.432
- OK, but late.
- OK. See you later.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.069
Delivery for 416,
from Filipe's restaurant.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.871
I'm hungry!

44:29.166 --> 44:32.960
I'm hungry for love!

44:33.045 --> 44:35.797
I'm hungry for love!

45:30.185 --> 45:32.854
Mm-hm. OK...

45:37.985 --> 45:39.527
Hot!

45:42.156 --> 45:44.240
Pretty good.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.170
It's lovely!

46:09.641 --> 46:12.560
Yes? Can I help you?

46:13.604 --> 46:16.439
Yes, you can help me.

46:17.983 --> 46:19.942
Wait a minute...

47:13.330 --> 47:16.499
- What's wrong?
- This man, I think I recognise him.

47:16.583 --> 47:19.585
I think he lives
in the apartment house.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.338
He just attacked me
for no reason at all.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.257
- It's all right.
- I opened the door.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.552
I was fixing your dinner.
He grabbed me and tried to kiss me.

47:27.636 --> 47:30.471
- Where is he now?
- I don't know. I think I killed him.

47:30.556 --> 47:32.807
I stabbed him
with something and he fell.

47:32.891 --> 47:35.059
Just stay here
and I'll go and check it out.

47:35.143 --> 47:36.853
- Just stay here.
- No, no.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.438
I'm not going to stay here
by myself, I'm going with you.

47:39.523 --> 47:44.193
Listen to me. It'll be safe for you here.
Just stay here and I'll be right back.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.570
OK?

49:18.038 --> 49:21.248
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

49:21.333 --> 49:24.919
I just couldn't let your dinner burn.

49:33.428 --> 49:36.097
It's strange!

49:39.643 --> 49:41.018
Go away!

49:46.775 --> 49:49.694
Get it off me!

49:53.073 --> 49:55.866
Get off!

49:55.951 --> 49:57.952
Get away from me.

50:06.420 --> 50:10.214
'Yes, Gunther, how
many times do I have to tell you, yes! '

50:19.182 --> 50:22.268
'Sometimes, Gunther, I wonder
if I should try to get along on my own

50:22.352 --> 50:25.021
- 'and not owe you anything.'
- 'Don't be that way.'

50:25.105 --> 50:27.189
'You're always helping me Gunther

50:27.274 --> 50:29.859
'but you don't miss the chance
to remind me..."

50:37.993 --> 50:40.953
Now, I want you to describe him
to the doorman.

50:41.038 --> 50:46.709
Maybe he'll know who he is
or where he lives, and his apartment.

50:46.793 --> 50:49.086
- How are you feeling?
- OK.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.307
Hey, doctor, please help us.

51:01.391 --> 51:03.559
- What happened?
- Please pardon me.

51:03.643 --> 51:06.062
I am Maurice Guilbault.
I am a resident here.

51:06.146 --> 51:09.065
We were walking in the hallway
and Doris my wife,

51:09.149 --> 51:11.942
- she was attacked by this thing.
- Where is this thing?

51:12.027 --> 51:19.408
I hit it! Then, I hit it with the cane,
down to the garbage.

51:20.452 --> 51:23.037
This is a nurse.
This is Nurse Forsythe.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.456
She is a nurse. She is a nurse.

51:25.540 --> 51:29.085
Take them back to their apartment.
Treat her for second degree burns.

51:29.169 --> 51:36.675
- What is the number of your apartment?
- 'Yes, we live in 703.'

51:39.096 --> 51:41.472
I'll meet you back there.
Don't leave until I get there.

51:41.556 --> 51:43.682
Lock the door.
Don't let anyone in except me. OK?

51:43.767 --> 51:47.186
- But where are you going?
- Down to the garbage.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.800
No, dear, it's not our floor.

52:55.005 --> 52:59.133
The Savlon, does that make
it feel any better?

53:08.768 --> 53:11.312
'Janine? '

53:17.652 --> 53:19.570
'Janine? '

53:28.997 --> 53:31.540
Nick? Are you up?

53:35.962 --> 53:39.924
Hello, Darling!
I feel wonderful.

53:40.967 --> 53:43.886
Come here.
Come and join me on the bed.

53:49.434 --> 53:55.606
You're absolutely beautiful.
Your eyes! Your mouth!

54:01.196 --> 54:03.948
You're absolutely
the most sexy thing alive.

54:05.867 --> 54:08.035
Do you want to make love?

54:08.954 --> 54:11.205
Nick, you're so strange.

54:12.165 --> 54:14.750
You'll make love to me,
won't you, Janine?

54:16.211 --> 54:18.254
You're my wife.

54:19.422 --> 54:24.301
You start it.
I think I've forgotten how to.

54:24.386 --> 54:27.096
- Nick, I can't take this.
- Janine.

54:55.333 --> 54:58.669
Make love to me, Janine!
You're my wife!

55:59.147 --> 56:00.981
Ah!

56:35.141 --> 56:37.184
No! Nick! Stop!

56:37.268 --> 56:39.978
Please stop!

56:43.149 --> 56:45.984
Make love to me.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.570
I want to be able to see us
when we make love.

56:48.655 --> 56:51.365
I want to put my contacts in.
Is that OK, Nick?

56:51.449 --> 56:53.367
I'm going to put my contacts in.

57:27.861 --> 57:30.028
Nick, I'm here.

58:32.300 --> 58:33.342
Betts?

1:00:04.100 --> 1:00:06.476
'Come on.'

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:12.357
'Faster! '

1:00:52.732 --> 1:00:54.858
I'm going to call the police.

1:00:54.942 --> 1:01:00.947
She's calling the police!
She's calling the police!

1:01:01.032 --> 1:01:03.075
Je ne sais pas!

1:01:03.159 --> 1:01:05.744
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

1:01:05.828 --> 1:01:08.038
What's going on?

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:15.504
Hey, miss! Nurse, come back!

1:01:15.588 --> 1:01:17.923
My wife, she needs something!

1:01:20.426 --> 1:01:22.552
Roger?

1:01:27.475 --> 1:01:29.851
Roger?

1:01:36.025 --> 1:01:38.026
Roger...

1:01:39.445 --> 1:01:43.699
Roger, where are you?

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:45.409
Roger...

1:02:08.641 --> 1:02:11.309
Doctor! You look awful.
What happened?

1:02:11.394 --> 1:02:14.020
Never mind how awful I look.

1:02:14.105 --> 1:02:18.692
Here's what I want you to do.
Call the police. You got that?

1:02:18.776 --> 1:02:21.737
Call them and tell them the head
of the medical centre needs help.

1:02:21.821 --> 1:02:24.030
Listen to me!

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:27.033
Tell them I need help
and to make it fast. Right away.

1:02:27.118 --> 1:02:29.035
OK.

1:02:30.705 --> 1:02:33.248
- 'Yes? Who is there? '
- Mr Guilbault.

1:02:33.332 --> 1:02:35.417
- 'Who is this? '
- Dr St. Luc.

1:02:35.501 --> 1:02:37.753
I need to talk to the nurse, please.

1:02:37.837 --> 1:02:41.506
'The nurse? She went away.
I think she went to look for you, doctor.'

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:46.011
- You stay where you are, all right?
- 'Stay where we are? '

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:51.183
- Understand? Stay where you are.
- 'Yes, OK. Goodbye.'

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:04.821
Who are those people?

1:03:08.743 --> 1:03:10.744
My God!

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:18.210
Go away! Leave us alone!

1:04:15.768 --> 1:04:18.520
No!

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:26.736
Forsythe?

1:05:55.326 --> 1:05:58.244
Hold on while I try
and crash through the door.

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.373
Dr St. Luc?

1:06:47.586 --> 1:06:49.421
Oh, here he is.

1:06:49.505 --> 1:06:52.924
Ah, good evening,
Mr Wolfe, Miss Lewis.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:09.774
Mr Merrick, why don't you do
something about all that noise?

1:07:09.859 --> 1:07:12.110
We like parties,
but this is ridiculous!

1:07:12.194 --> 1:07:17.073
Well, there might be a connection.
You see, it's about your locker...

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:20.285
I'm afraid somebody broke into it
earlier in the evening.

1:07:20.369 --> 1:07:22.954
- Oh, what a drag!
- Are you serious?

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:24.581
I'm afraid so.

1:07:24.665 --> 1:07:28.251
I have some of the things that
they were throwing around in my office.

1:07:28.335 --> 1:07:30.628
If you'd care to come
and identify them...

1:07:54.862 --> 1:07:57.989
What's going on? Let's get out.

1:08:44.537 --> 1:08:46.830
Baby...

1:08:46.914 --> 1:08:49.207
Do I feel good to you?

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:53.503
Yes, very good.

1:08:59.635 --> 1:09:02.303
Do you know what I want?

1:09:04.014 --> 1:09:06.099
I want you to make love with me.

1:09:07.726 --> 1:09:11.187
Make love to me, Janine.

1:09:11.272 --> 1:09:14.357
- You can't...
- Make love to me.

1:09:16.735 --> 1:09:23.116
- You can't be saying that.
- Let's kiss and make up, baby.

1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:26.703
Make love to me,
make love to me.

1:09:26.787 --> 1:09:29.789
Let's kiss and make up!

1:10:56.961 --> 1:10:59.545
Rollo and the police
will be here by now.

1:10:59.630 --> 1:11:04.968
So all we have to do is avoid these
people till they find us or we find them.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:05.320
Dr St. Luc?

1:12:06.572 --> 1:12:08.781
Dr St. Luc?

1:12:12.536 --> 1:12:14.704
Roger?

1:12:16.373 --> 1:12:19.000
Dr Linsky here!

1:12:32.097 --> 1:12:36.225
Roger, Rollo here to have
that consultation we talked about.

1:12:38.312 --> 1:12:40.146
Roger?

1:12:41.315 --> 1:12:44.901
Hey, Rog?

1:12:44.985 --> 1:12:47.362
Mr Tudor?

1:12:55.537 --> 1:12:57.955
Mr Tudor, I'm Dr Linsky.

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:06.589
Mr Tudor?

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:26.150
All right...

1:13:35.661 --> 1:13:37.328
Ah!

1:13:51.176 --> 1:13:54.137
Help! Roger!

1:14:38.974 --> 1:14:41.225
- No.
- Take if off!

1:14:42.728 --> 1:14:46.522
No... No! Tudor!

1:15:05.459 --> 1:15:09.754
Roger, I had a very disturbing dream
last night.

1:15:09.838 --> 1:15:15.218
In this dream, I found myself
making love to a strange man.

1:15:18.931 --> 1:15:25.853
Only, I'm having trouble, you see,
because he's old, and dying.

1:15:27.689 --> 1:15:30.775
He smells bad
and I find him repulsive.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:39.325
But then he tells me
that everything is erotic.

1:15:40.911 --> 1:15:45.414
That everything is sexual.
You know what I mean?

1:15:48.585 --> 1:15:53.631
He tells me
that even old flesh is erotic flesh.

1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:59.637
That disease is the love of two
alien kinds of creatures for each other.

1:16:01.848 --> 1:16:06.811
That even dying
is an act of eroticism.

1:16:09.606 --> 1:16:16.070
That talking is sexual.
That breathing is sexual.

1:16:17.447 --> 1:16:21.158
That even
to physically exist is sexual.

1:16:22.953 --> 1:16:29.542
And I believe him.
And we make love beautifully.

1:18:06.515 --> 1:18:08.391
Go back!

1:20:25.028 --> 1:20:28.948
Hey, come on out!
Do you want to go to a party?

1:20:33.829 --> 1:20:36.705
Hey, come on out.

1:20:51.221 --> 1:20:55.808
Have you met my daughter, Erica?
She's a beautiful girl.

1:20:55.892 --> 1:20:58.102
Come here, Erica.

1:20:58.186 --> 1:21:01.772
I think you'd really like
my daughter, Erica.

1:26:20.633 --> 1:26:23.594
