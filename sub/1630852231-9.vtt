just take it down

30:13.145 --> 30:15.145
This is my usual route
I got to drag.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.947
There's not any
fresh snow to push,

30:16.949 --> 30:19.883
but I'll still be able to tell
if it's gonna solve my problems.

30:19.885 --> 30:23.554
Since I'm out here living alone,
far from other people,

30:23.556 --> 30:26.490
the responsibility to mitigate
risk as much as possible

30:26.492 --> 30:28.425
is totally on myself.

30:28.427 --> 30:32.462
So I always have to kind of
imagine the worst-case scenario

30:32.464 --> 30:33.664
and plan for that.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.666
Some of these narrow spots
are where I'm worried about

30:35.668 --> 30:40.904
it breaking, because it's just
got to squeeze through there.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.339
The better I can
make this trail,

30:42.341 --> 30:44.775
the easier I can make it
to be able to use this truck,

30:44.777 --> 30:47.377
and use it to give myself
the best fighting chance

30:47.379 --> 30:49.880
if there's an emergency.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.082
Okay, that was a narrow spot
I just squeezed and had a tug.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.917
I want to check it.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.353
See if that did any damage
right there.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.961
So far the drag itself
is holding up fine.

31:03.963 --> 31:08.232
So this, kind of this line,
like right here,

31:08.234 --> 31:12.336
this is, this is like how wide
the trail was before,

31:12.338 --> 31:14.972
and then it's pushing
all this extra.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.741
So shoving it out further
is really good.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.576
That's pretty cool.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.711
I mean, we got more to test,

31:20.713 --> 31:24.281
but the uphill side
was cut off really good,

31:24.283 --> 31:27.417
and that's one of those spots
where it was sliding a lot.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.486
We got more spots
like that to hit,

31:29.488 --> 31:32.489
but that's definitely
a good sign.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.958
The weight of the thing alone
might also just help keep it

31:34.960 --> 31:38.795
from sliding a lot, as well.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.430
I can see that this bank,

31:40.432 --> 31:43.667
it is grabbing that bank
and pushing it out more, so.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.068
I'm getting some extra width,

31:45.070 --> 31:49.039
and it looks like it's just
pushing right through that snow.

31:50.442 --> 31:52.709
Yeah, so this whole section
over here, this one spot

Being out here, you have an
opportunity to isolate yourself,

44:04.976 --> 44:10.513
to get to know yourself and find
a more meaningful purpose.

44:10.515 --> 44:13.616
I think ultimately, that's what
we're all after, is freedom.

44:13.618 --> 44:18.354
It's a lot of work
to live this lifestyle.

44:18.356 --> 44:21.357
But to me, it's a life
worth living.
