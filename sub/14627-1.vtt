00:47.761 --> 00:49.126
Nic?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.757
Nicole!

00:52.132 --> 00:53.224
Holy shit.

01:11.752 --> 01:15.711
Did you really think l was gonna stay
in there the whole time?

01:26.733 --> 01:28.724
Come back here.

02:19.853 --> 02:22.185
-Bingo.
-Jackpot.

02:22.689 --> 02:23.849
Hey, Sam!

02:24.724 --> 02:27.090
-Hey!
-Yeah, you, you ding-dong.

02:27.294 --> 02:29.159
-Come here.
-Surprise.

02:29.596 --> 02:32.827
-Not now, Dwight. l'm kind of busy.
-You owe my boss money.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.830
Hey, l owe everybody money.

02:37.103 --> 02:38.400
Hey!

02:39.906 --> 02:41.339
Hey!

02:41.908 --> 02:43.603
You hit my leg, you dummy.

02:44.244 --> 02:46.303
You really gonna
make me chase you?

03:07.033 --> 03:08.091
Excuse me.

03:30.957 --> 03:32.390
Get back here!

03:44.437 --> 03:46.132
Hands behind your head. Now.

03:46.306 --> 03:48.797
Take it easy, skippy.

03:49.442 --> 03:51.603
l'm on the job.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.313
Oh, wow, look at this. Bounty hunter.

03:57.384 --> 04:00.080
Figures. Why don't you get
a real job?

04:02.822 --> 04:04.084
Why don't you kiss my ass?

04:06.526 --> 04:08.084
Come here.

04:08.261 --> 04:10.195
Oh, your mother
must be very, very proud.

04:10.397 --> 04:13.093
Oh, l'm so insulted.
You know, for your information...

04:13.266 --> 04:15.826
...l don't even know who my mother is.
So joke's on you.

04:16.002 --> 04:18.766
-Turn around. Hands behind your back.
-What?

04:19.305 --> 04:20.829
You heard me. Let's go.

04:21.007 --> 04:23.601
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

04:34.354 --> 04:37.152
-Hey, Gary. You get my e-mail?
-About the suicide, yeah?

04:37.324 --> 04:40.191
He's got a sister in Atlantic City.
Address is on your desk.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.987
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

04:43.029 --> 04:44.360
Day or night.

04:56.576 --> 04:58.168
Very funny.

05:01.314 --> 05:03.248
Who's Mr. Ed?

05:04.017 --> 05:06.485
l actually think it's sexy
that you're out on bail.

05:07.554 --> 05:10.387
-Stewart, get off my desk.
-Right. Oh, sorry. l forgot.

05:10.557 --> 05:13.492
Ridiculous that l was even arrested
in the first place.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.686
l mean, assaulting an officer?
lt's a joke.

05:16.863 --> 05:20.060
Yeah. Oh, tell me about it.
Been there.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.997
Did you ever get anything going
on that suicide story?

05:25.205 --> 05:27.833
-No.
-Because know what l was thinking?

05:28.008 --> 05:30.408
Maybe we should work together on it,
as a team.

05:30.577 --> 05:32.943
You know?
Woodward-Bernstein style. Yeah.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.843
That way, you can knock it out
just that much faster.

05:36.016 --> 05:39.713
Plus, it would give us time
to reconnect in our relationship.

05:39.886 --> 05:42.719
Stewart, we are not in a relationship.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.517
We made out one time
at the Christmas party.

05:45.992 --> 05:49.928
l was very drunk.
And l was heartbroken.

05:50.096 --> 05:51.586
l would've made out with Terry.

05:53.299 --> 05:56.097
Wait, you mean Terry the guy
or Terry the girl?

05:56.269 --> 05:58.203
Exactly.
Really wouldn't have mattered.

05:58.371 --> 06:00.396
You're right.
Because you made out with me.

06:00.573 --> 06:04.100
Yes, l did.
All right, l'm gonna use the bathroom.

06:07.914 --> 06:10.940
<i>-This is Jimmy.
-Jimmy, Nicole from the Daily News.</i>

06:11.117 --> 06:12.641
Nicole?

06:13.453 --> 06:15.887
Long time no talk.
Where you been hiding yourself?

06:16.056 --> 06:18.115
l'm actually hiding
in the bathroom at work.

06:18.291 --> 06:22.318
Listen, l need you to ask around
about a suicide.

06:22.529 --> 06:26.260
A Walter Lilly, Rivington Street...

06:26.433 --> 06:27.957
...the night of June 23rd.

06:28.635 --> 06:30.762
Twenty-three. Anything else?

06:30.937 --> 06:34.634
Yes. Yes. l have proof
that there was a black SUV...

06:34.808 --> 06:37.140
...with stolen plates
parked at the scene.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.005
Might be something.
You never know.

06:39.179 --> 06:41.909
All right. Cool.
l hear anything, l'll give you a shout.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.913
Okay, great. Thanks.

06:44.784 --> 06:45.808
Who you talking to?

06:47.087 --> 06:48.247
Stewart.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.251
What are you doing
in the ladies room?

06:52.425 --> 06:53.824
You see, l wa--

06:54.627 --> 06:58.461
l-- Well, you know, l was standing
out front there, by the door.

06:58.631 --> 07:01.498
-But l started to feel creepy.
-And this is less creepy?

07:01.968 --> 07:02.992
Yeah, l think so.

07:03.169 --> 07:04.693
-Get out of here.
-Oh, come on.

07:04.871 --> 07:06.270
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

07:06.439 --> 07:08.430
-l have a date.
-l didn't say what night.

07:08.608 --> 07:10.098
Then l have a date every night.

07:10.276 --> 07:12.107
Every night until the end of time.

07:12.278 --> 07:15.111
Okay? So just please
stop asking me.

07:18.485 --> 07:21.387
Love is so funny. lsn't it?

07:40.206 --> 07:43.073
<i>-Hi, Ma.
-ls this a bad time?</i>

07:43.243 --> 07:47.009
Well, yeah, l'm actually
kind of in the middle of something.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.671
But you know what,
while l have you on the phone....

07:49.849 --> 07:51.840
lf you were gonna
jump off a building...

07:52.018 --> 07:54.714
...would you choose the side
with trees?

07:54.888 --> 07:58.187
Or would you choose the side
that's a straight shot to the cement?

07:58.358 --> 08:01.327
Well, the trees would certainly be
prettier on the way down.

08:01.494 --> 08:03.325
Kind of a nice last picture.

08:03.496 --> 08:06.192
lt might break your fall.
You could end up a vegetable.

08:06.366 --> 08:09.358
-l don't think l could take that on.
-So the cement?

08:09.536 --> 08:11.265
Definitely. Why do you ask?

08:11.437 --> 08:14.167
l'm on a rooftop at 6th and Rivington.
l was wondering--

08:14.340 --> 08:15.864
Now, you listen here, young lady.

08:16.042 --> 08:18.340
-You have every right to hate your life.
-Mom.

08:18.511 --> 08:20.945
Who wouldn't after some
of the choices you've made.

08:21.147 --> 08:22.614
<i>-Mom?
-That thing with Milo--</i>

08:22.782 --> 08:23.942
<i>-Mom.
-What?</i>

08:24.150 --> 08:25.174
l'm working.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.214
<i>l'm gonna call you later.</i>

08:28.388 --> 08:30.549
Well, okay.
Well, just to clarify, you know...

08:30.723 --> 08:34.557
...we all make mistakes, but you
married a man who made you crazy...

08:34.727 --> 08:38.390
<i>...and divorced him for the same
reason. You just have to--</i>

08:43.970 --> 08:46.097
l'll take the big ugly one.

08:52.378 --> 08:54.573
l do not like getting
these phone calls.

08:55.281 --> 08:58.216
l'd bail you out
if you ever got in trouble.

08:58.384 --> 09:00.750
But you can't,
because you ain't no cop anymore.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.548
And what do you mean,
''these calls,'' huh?

09:03.723 --> 09:05.748
That's the second time
you bailed me out.

09:05.925 --> 09:07.825
''These'' implies way more than two.

09:07.994 --> 09:11.555
Look, l know that this is a very tough
time of the year for you.

09:11.731 --> 09:14.894
What are you talking about? lt's
summer. Who doesn't love summer?

09:15.068 --> 09:17.901
And l am trying to be sensitive
to your situation.

09:18.404 --> 09:23.398
What, a guy who works his own hours?
Has his freedom? Lives the high life?

09:26.946 --> 09:28.811
Have you talked to her?

09:29.749 --> 09:32.718
-Talked to who?
-Katie Couric. Who do you think?

09:34.020 --> 09:36.420
-Why the hell would l talk to her?
-You know what?

09:36.589 --> 09:40.787
-Maybe l should've left your ass in jail.
-Would you relax? l'm fine.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.363
Oh, you're-- No. You are not fine,
okay? You are a man in pain.

09:45.531 --> 09:48.864
How do you think that makes me feel
since l'm the one who set you up?

09:49.035 --> 09:52.095
Well, l guess that makes
this whole thing your fault, huh?

09:53.339 --> 09:56.137
Hey. Where are you?

09:56.309 --> 09:58.743
l told you to be here
half an hour early.

09:59.312 --> 10:00.370
Now l see you.

10:00.546 --> 10:03.037
l'm still leaving you this message
to let you know...

10:03.249 --> 10:07.379
...that l hate being your lawyer
and you're killing me. Goodbye.

10:07.553 --> 10:10.351
-Hello. You're late.
-But only fashionably.

10:10.523 --> 10:13.788
Better take this seriously, Miss Hurley.
lt's you against the N.Y.P.D.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.827
How can l take this seriously, Arthur?
lt's a fender bender.

10:16.996 --> 10:20.159
-Well, we got four minutes.
-Oh, wait, hold on. l gotta take this.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.301
No. Four minutes.

10:22.468 --> 10:25.631
This will take one,
and then we'll have three.

10:25.972 --> 10:28.497
-Hello.
-lt's Jimmy. l got something for you.

10:29.509 --> 10:33.502
Oh, hi. Great. Listen,
l need to call you back in an hour.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.843
Can't wait, Nicole. l might already
be in trouble with this shit.

10:37.016 --> 10:41.248
Wha--? Jimmy, well, l'm kind of in
some hot water myself over here.

10:41.421 --> 10:45.517
Dunkin' Donuts, Sunset Park
under the BQE. Half an hour.

10:45.692 --> 10:49.685
Bring cash. Five hundred,
or l'm selling it to somebody else.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.762
-No, Jimmy. Wait--
-Okay. Let's go.

10:51.931 --> 10:53.990
Wait. l have to make
one more phone call.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.259
-Nicole.
-Go on in.

10:55.435 --> 10:57.835
l will-- l promise,
l will be right behind you.

10:58.004 --> 11:01.997
When the judge calls your case,
you better be sitting right next to me.

11:02.175 --> 11:03.608
And your client is where?

11:04.844 --> 11:07.779
Well, she was here, Your Honor.

11:07.947 --> 11:09.915
And l think
she deserves points for that.

11:10.516 --> 11:13.110
l'm sure she'll be coming
through that door any second.

11:18.524 --> 11:19.923
Any second.

11:20.093 --> 11:23.221
Rather than keep the court waiting,
if we could set another date.

11:23.396 --> 11:25.728
Counsel, your client's bail
is revoked.

11:25.898 --> 11:29.095
A bench warrant is hereby ordered
by this court.

11:29.268 --> 11:30.737
Next case.

11:47.153 --> 11:50.213
-Come here.
-Okay. All right. Okay.

11:50.390 --> 11:52.119
Get in the car.

11:52.291 --> 11:53.883
And don't move.

12:09.909 --> 12:13.470
Goddamn it. l mean,
how many retainers do l have to buy?

12:13.646 --> 12:16.114
-They're twins, for God's sake.
-lt's not my fault.

12:16.282 --> 12:19.683
Tell him to borrow
his brother's. Man.

12:40.273 --> 12:43.436
Hey, princess.
You're drooling on my sofa.

12:45.311 --> 12:48.542
You do have an apartment, don't you?
With a bed of some kind?

12:50.483 --> 12:53.111
Teresa should be in any second.

12:53.653 --> 12:58.955
-l suppose you wanna get paid.
-Yep. Well, l got him, didn't l?

12:59.192 --> 13:02.559
l said, ''They're my kids. lf anyone's
gonna take them camping...

13:02.728 --> 13:05.720
...l am,'' which she took literally,
as opposed to the spirit...

13:05.932 --> 13:08.400
-...in which it was said.
-The spirit of bullshit?

13:08.568 --> 13:11.366
-Any plans for the long weekend?
-The usual.

13:11.537 --> 13:15.337
What, getting drunk on cheap whiskey
and smashing your fist through a wall?

13:15.508 --> 13:16.532
Jealous?

13:16.709 --> 13:19.075
No, l understand.
Fourth of July and all.

13:19.245 --> 13:21.213
Don't worry. l'll get somebody else.

13:22.048 --> 13:24.539
-Somebody else for what?
-An open bond just came in.

13:25.051 --> 13:27.747
But you know what?
Your thing sounds a lot more fun.

13:27.954 --> 13:30.514
Don't worry about it.
l mean, l'll find somebody else.

13:30.690 --> 13:34.649
Whoa, hold up, Heidi. l need this gig.
Come on, man, l'm in the hole.

13:34.827 --> 13:37.728
-You're always in the hole.
-What's your point?

13:37.897 --> 13:40.991
My point is l don't know
if you're the right person for the job.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.998
This thing could be a disaster.

13:44.337 --> 13:45.668
But you asked for it.

13:52.678 --> 13:54.703
-ls this a joke?
-Nope.

13:56.082 --> 13:57.413
She got arrested?

13:57.583 --> 14:01.383
l don't understand it myself,
but all l know is that she skipped bail.

14:01.921 --> 14:03.855
Well, why the hell did you post it?

14:04.023 --> 14:07.356
Hey, l'm a businessman.
l don't have time to wait for you.

14:07.527 --> 14:10.018
All l know is, is that l'm out 50,000...

14:10.196 --> 14:12.130
...if she's not
in that courtroom Monday.

14:12.298 --> 14:15.756
You're telling me
that l'll get 5 grand...

14:15.935 --> 14:18.802
...to go pick up my ex-wife
and bring her to jail.

14:19.305 --> 14:20.772
You're a good listener.

14:26.279 --> 14:29.077
-Yes. Yes.
-l take it you're interested?

14:29.582 --> 14:31.106
-Am l interested?
-Oh, God. Okay.

14:31.284 --> 14:33.548
-You are the best friend...
-All right. Okay.

14:33.719 --> 14:36.711
-...any guy could ever have.
-Milo. Check.

14:44.597 --> 14:47.293
Okay. Can l have my gum back?

14:50.636 --> 14:54.003
You know what this is?
This, baby, is karma.

14:54.173 --> 14:57.267
-Are you sure you can handle this?
-Why wouldn't l?

14:57.443 --> 15:00.139
Because it's her, and around her
you're not rational.

15:00.313 --> 15:03.476
Sweetheart,
l won't even break a sweat.

15:38.684 --> 15:39.981
Oh, shit.

17:03.035 --> 17:04.434
Hello, love.

17:05.171 --> 17:06.433
Oh, Jesus.

17:09.809 --> 17:12.539
Oh, God. Kitty?

17:13.212 --> 17:15.077
l was in the neighborhood...

17:15.247 --> 17:18.478
...and l had lent her
some paintbrushes months ago.

17:18.684 --> 17:21.084
And she just refuses to--
Okay, okay, okay.

17:21.252 --> 17:22.914
She didn't show up to court today.

17:23.089 --> 17:26.752
And l think it's because she has a lead
on some story.

17:26.925 --> 17:31.090
And l wanna work on it with her
as a team because l....

17:31.297 --> 17:34.789
Because l'm kind of hoping
it would help solidify...

17:35.501 --> 17:36.798
...our thing.

17:39.772 --> 17:41.501
Are you sleeping with her, Stewart?

17:44.143 --> 17:47.306
-We have a history.
-A history, huh?

17:48.814 --> 17:50.748
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

17:50.916 --> 17:53.350
Don't be such a wuss.
Come on, l'm sorry.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.510
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty.

17:55.721 --> 17:57.985
-You're not Jimmy.
-Oh, God. No, l'm not.

17:58.157 --> 18:01.092
-But l'm looking for him.
-Under the chair?

18:01.260 --> 18:03.990
-Maybe you could help me.
-l can't fit under there.

18:04.163 --> 18:05.596
-No--
-Who are you?

18:05.765 --> 18:10.099
-l'm-- l'm his girlfriend.
-You're Lakeisha?

18:10.636 --> 18:13.696
Yeah, that would be me. Lakeisha.

18:13.873 --> 18:17.639
Named after my Aunt Lakeisha.

18:17.810 --> 18:21.211
-Well, maybe l should call the cops.
-No, no, no. Jimmy's in trouble.

18:21.380 --> 18:25.009
What kind of trouble?
Money trouble? Drug trouble?

18:25.184 --> 18:27.982
-l don't--
-Sex-change trouble?

18:29.054 --> 18:31.887
l don't really know.
l just know that he's missing.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.719
Yeah, well, l had a lousy week too.

18:35.895 --> 18:38.056
My cousin Linda
fell off the cruise ship.

18:39.799 --> 18:40.823
l'm so sorry.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.764
Well, a grown woman
ought to know how to swim.

18:46.372 --> 18:47.839
Yes, l hear you.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.999
Now would you mind
if l just took a quick look around...

18:51.177 --> 18:54.169
...just to see if l can find some clue
as to where he might be?

18:54.346 --> 18:58.146
Thing is, Stew, she'll make you think
she's interested in you.

18:58.884 --> 19:02.047
But really she's only interested
in her big hotshot career.

19:02.221 --> 19:04.155
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:05.558 --> 19:08.083
Wait a minute. Wait, you're Milo.

19:08.294 --> 19:11.354
You're Milo, right?
She talks about you all the time.

19:12.331 --> 19:16.358
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, man, absolutely.

19:16.535 --> 19:17.559
Yeah, she hates you.

19:19.572 --> 19:21.938
Wait, what do you mean?
She hates me?

19:22.107 --> 19:24.371
Oh, yeah. Big time. Yeah.

19:24.543 --> 19:29.412
She says-- She says you're, like,
the most selfish, immature--

19:29.582 --> 19:31.846
-Wait, l'm selfish?
-Yeah. Stubborn.

19:32.017 --> 19:34.451
-l'm immature?
-l don't know. That's what she says.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.417
You know what? Forget it. Okay?

19:36.589 --> 19:39.080
l'm not even gonna
dignify that with-- Whatever.

19:39.258 --> 19:41.692
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look, l'm on your team, man.

19:41.861 --> 19:45.422
No, you're not, Geraldo.
l don't allow reporters on my team.

19:45.598 --> 19:48.624
Oh, and for the record,
l'm the one who hates her.

19:48.834 --> 19:51.894
Okay? So just shut up
and stop pissing me off.

19:53.873 --> 19:55.966
Okay. Sorry.

19:59.345 --> 20:03.111
<i>Borgata Hotel, Atlantic City.
How may l direct your call?</i>

20:04.083 --> 20:07.280
Figures. Run home to Mommy.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.765
What audit?

20:24.803 --> 20:27.101
<i>Jimmy? You mean the bartender
from O'Doul's?</i>

20:27.273 --> 20:31.266
l'm really worried about him. His car
was there. His window was smashed.

20:31.443 --> 20:33.308
There was something not right.

20:36.315 --> 20:38.112
What was he looking into?

20:38.284 --> 20:40.582
<i>That suicide on Rivington
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

20:42.121 --> 20:43.986
<i>Something about it
just does not add up.</i>

20:44.156 --> 20:47.148
<i>-Why? What do you got?
-l was at traffic court the other day...</i>

20:47.326 --> 20:51.160
...and l met this guy who swears
that his car was parked at JFK...

20:51.330 --> 20:54.322
...the night that he got a ticket
on Rivington.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.264
-Stolen plates.
-Yeah, well, that's what l'm thinking.

20:57.436 --> 21:01.133
Look, if l hear anything on the kid
l'll let you know, but you...

21:01.307 --> 21:04.333
-...be careful, okay?
-Okay, great. Bobby, thanks.

21:37.443 --> 21:40.139
More pink, Tony.
Way the hell more pink.

21:40.312 --> 21:43.577
l wanna sparkle
with the illusion of youth.

21:43.816 --> 21:46.148
And in a room this small,
hell, forget lighting.

21:46.318 --> 21:48.309
We might have to use nerve gas.

21:50.489 --> 21:51.513
Hello, Kitty.

21:52.691 --> 21:54.181
Milo?

21:57.229 --> 21:59.754
Milo, sweetheart.

21:59.965 --> 22:02.331
Come and give your mother-in-law
a hug.

22:02.501 --> 22:03.695
A long time.

22:04.570 --> 22:07.562
That's for being a shit
and for ruining my daughter's life.

22:08.073 --> 22:11.873
-Your daughter's fine.
-Well, then that's for ruining my life.

22:12.378 --> 22:14.073
Come here.

22:15.214 --> 22:17.739
lt still kills me,
you and Nicole splitting up.

22:17.916 --> 22:20.350
What happened between you
devastated her.

22:20.519 --> 22:24.683
-Yeah, devastated her right to the top.
-She has done well, hasn't she?

22:25.891 --> 22:29.554
Listen, Nicky may be a strong,
independent woman on the outside...

22:29.728 --> 22:33.926
...but on the inside, she's just a girl
wanting to be loved by her man.

22:34.099 --> 22:36.932
l mean, come on.
Such a beautiful couple...

22:37.102 --> 22:39.229
...and you threw it away.

22:39.938 --> 22:41.929
The grandchildren
would have been angels.

22:42.107 --> 22:45.201
Not that l wanted grandchildren.
You prick.

22:46.412 --> 22:47.640
l've missed you, Kitty.

22:48.914 --> 22:50.438
l'm gonna pretend l believe you.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.512
l'm looking for your girl.

22:53.719 --> 22:56.279
-l know she called here.
-We were gonna grab a bite.

22:56.455 --> 22:58.150
She blew me off
for some interview.

22:58.323 --> 23:01.588
Said she needed to go somewhere
to suck up some luck.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.661
Like l'm supposed to know
what that means.

23:37.196 --> 23:39.187
-Hello.
-Listen, you're in trouble.

23:39.364 --> 23:42.800
-Now, where are you?
-l'm in the city, actually.

23:44.670 --> 23:47.798
No, you're not. No, you're not.
You're here. You're at the track.

23:47.973 --> 23:51.636
You're here?
How did you know where l was?

23:51.810 --> 23:53.209
Hello, Nic.

23:53.378 --> 23:55.778
<i>Let's just say
Stewart knows what he's doing...</i>

23:55.948 --> 23:59.611
<i>...when it comes to following people.</i>

24:00.219 --> 24:02.119
Hi, Milo.

24:04.156 --> 24:05.623
Fancy meeting you here.

24:07.192 --> 24:08.591
Yeah.

24:08.861 --> 24:11.830
Fancy. Fancy that.

24:12.364 --> 24:13.661
How are you?

24:15.167 --> 24:17.465
Good. You?

24:18.137 --> 24:19.798
Swell.

24:21.039 --> 24:22.131
Beautiful day.

24:30.115 --> 24:31.742
You look great.

24:32.918 --> 24:34.749
As beautiful as the day we first met.

24:36.989 --> 24:39.753
This has been grand.

24:39.925 --> 24:43.156
l don't know what you're up to,
but l'm working.

24:43.328 --> 24:44.693
Oh, working?

24:44.863 --> 24:46.023
Me too.

24:47.132 --> 24:48.997
l heard you got kicked off the force.

24:49.168 --> 24:50.635
You been checking up on me?

24:51.136 --> 24:53.001
-Nope.
-Concerned about me?

24:53.672 --> 24:56.072
l haven't given you
a thought, actually.

24:58.143 --> 25:00.703
Trying to keep some small connection
alive between us.

25:02.281 --> 25:03.714
Are you gonna move this leg?

25:06.218 --> 25:07.708
No.

25:08.220 --> 25:12.122
l thought we'd be adults the first time
we saw each other after the divorce.

25:12.291 --> 25:16.523
But why would l think that when
only one of us is actually an adult?

25:16.695 --> 25:21.291
Like l said, l've been working.
And what l do is l hunt down criminals.

25:21.466 --> 25:24.230
ldiots who jump bail, specifically.

25:24.970 --> 25:27.734
-You are a bounty hunter?
-Yep.

25:27.906 --> 25:31.307
And much as it pains me to say this,
and it really does...

25:31.476 --> 25:33.467
...l gotta take you to jail.

25:38.550 --> 25:42.953
Oh, God. All right.
Come on, who put you up to this?

25:43.121 --> 25:45.988
-Somebody at the paper?
-No, just the old State of New York.

25:46.191 --> 25:48.591
-Are you--? Don't you touch me.
-Shall we?

25:48.760 --> 25:50.785
You really think
you're taking me anywhere?

25:50.963 --> 25:53.261
No, not anywhere. Just jail.

25:53.432 --> 25:55.900
Oh, goddamn it, Milo.
You don't seem to understand.

25:56.068 --> 25:58.764
l am in the middle of something
really important.

25:58.937 --> 26:01.167
Tell you what.
You wanna make a break for it...

26:01.340 --> 26:03.774
...l will give you
a 1 0-second head start.

26:03.942 --> 26:07.571
-l am an adult, Milo. l'm--
-Ten.

26:07.746 --> 26:09.611
-Nine. Eight.
-Do you really think l--?

26:10.515 --> 26:11.812
Seven.

26:13.352 --> 26:15.320
Six.

26:15.487 --> 26:17.318
Five. Four.

26:18.724 --> 26:21.955
Three. Two.

26:22.427 --> 26:23.951
One.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.998
Try again.

26:49.021 --> 26:51.182
-God.
-Extra salt, just the way you like it.

26:54.693 --> 26:57.526
-Jesus. Stewart, no.
-l wanna help. Let me help. Please.

26:58.697 --> 27:00.494
Why'd you hang up on me?

27:03.802 --> 27:05.292
Taxi.

27:09.408 --> 27:10.636
Oh, shit.

27:11.176 --> 27:13.736
-Get in the car.
-l am not going to jail.

27:13.912 --> 27:15.880
Oh, l beg to differ.

27:18.283 --> 27:22.549
-Oh, what, you're gonna shoot me?
-Nope.

27:22.721 --> 27:26.987
-l'm gonna shoot a cab driver.
-No, he's kidd-- He doesn't mean it.

27:27.159 --> 27:28.854
No, l mean it.

27:29.661 --> 27:31.526
Chickenshits!

27:33.532 --> 27:35.727
All right.
Can we just talk about this?

27:37.002 --> 27:38.526
Fine.

27:38.804 --> 27:40.396
What do you wanna say?

27:45.811 --> 27:49.110
l'm not letting you take me to jail.

27:50.015 --> 27:51.676
-Duly noted.
-And l'm--

27:52.684 --> 27:56.211
Milo. Oh, my--
You have got to be kidding me.

27:56.388 --> 27:58.913
You have got to be kidding me.
Don't you--

27:59.091 --> 28:02.288
Milo, stop it.
Seriously, put me down.

28:02.461 --> 28:03.689
Milo, goddamn it.

28:04.563 --> 28:09.227
You cannot be putting me in a trunk.
You cannot be seri--

28:09.401 --> 28:11.892
l'm dead ''seri.''

28:14.539 --> 28:15.904
Hey, Mi-- Hey!

28:16.074 --> 28:19.737
Oh, my God. l'm gonna have
a panic attack. Oh, my God. Milo!

28:19.911 --> 28:22.880
Milo. Goddamn it!
Open this trunk, Milo.

28:23.048 --> 28:24.811
Right now. Milo.

28:24.983 --> 28:27.611
Okay. Okay.

28:30.489 --> 28:33.720
Yeah, l've got
a couple of small tats myself.

28:34.626 --> 28:38.153
But l'm still amazed at the level of pain
people will go through...

28:38.363 --> 28:41.298
...to make an impression.
Do you know what l mean?

28:42.434 --> 28:44.664
l was just asking around.

28:44.870 --> 28:47.964
Okay? l swear to God,
l don't know anything.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.439
What if l tattoo the word ''snitch''
on your eyelids?

28:51.610 --> 28:55.944
-Or better yet, ''dead snitch.''
-Look, okay, look. Look.

28:56.114 --> 28:58.981
All l know
is there's this reporter, okay?

28:59.151 --> 29:03.679
And she said something about
a car with stolen plates at a suicide.

29:05.390 --> 29:07.255
What's her name?

29:11.530 --> 29:12.929
Sid's Bail Bonds.

29:13.098 --> 29:15.430
<i>Guess what l've got in my trunk.</i>

29:15.600 --> 29:18.535
ls that some sort
of perverted innuendo? Who is this?

29:18.703 --> 29:21.263
Oh, come on, Teresa, it's me.
You know it's me.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.603
-Hey, l need to talk to Sid.
-Yeah, Sid's not available right now.

29:24.776 --> 29:28.644
Last l heard, he was trying to start
a fire with two sticks and pure rage.

29:28.814 --> 29:31.715
Just tell him that l got her,
all right? l'm bringing her in.

29:31.917 --> 29:35.876
l'll be back in two hours, and l want
a bonus for bringing her in so quick.

29:36.054 --> 29:40.115
Well, l want a bonus for getting through
the week without stabbing somebody.

29:41.126 --> 29:43.151
Week's not over yet.

29:44.362 --> 29:45.454
l got another call.

29:45.630 --> 29:48.656
Yeah, l gotta go too.
Very busy. Bye-bye.

29:50.168 --> 29:53.626
This is Milo. l'm sorry, but l'm not in
at the moment to take your call.

29:53.805 --> 29:57.571
Milo, get me out of the trunk. Please.

29:59.177 --> 30:02.874
Nope. Oh, by the way, your boyfriend
Stewart's been following me.

30:03.582 --> 30:07.074
-He is not my boyfriend.
-Well, he seems to think he is.

30:07.252 --> 30:10.312
Well, l remember a time
l thought you were quite the catch...

30:10.489 --> 30:13.856
-...and that didn't pan out, either.
-He doesn't really seem your type.

30:14.025 --> 30:18.018
Listen. Okay, Milo, please. Please.

30:18.196 --> 30:20.892
l shouldn't have run. That was--

30:21.066 --> 30:22.590
Look, you caught me off-guard.

30:22.767 --> 30:26.259
To tell you the truth, l think l really
need your advice about something.

30:26.471 --> 30:27.529
That's a real shame...

30:27.706 --> 30:31.437
...because l wouldn't help you
if you were the last baby sea turtle...

30:31.610 --> 30:35.444
...dragging your tiny little body
across the burning sand...

30:35.614 --> 30:38.378
...whilst hungry seagulls
circled overhead.

30:38.550 --> 30:41.018
Nope, l'd just pull up a chair...

30:41.186 --> 30:45.350
<i>...sip a piña colada,
and watch nature take its course.</i>

30:47.192 --> 30:51.925
-Hello?
-You stop.

30:52.097 --> 30:53.530
<i>Hello?</i>

30:54.699 --> 30:56.360
Nic?

30:57.068 --> 30:58.194
Nicole?

30:59.638 --> 31:00.730
What?

31:02.641 --> 31:04.609
Hey, remember
how we used to be in love?

31:06.511 --> 31:07.773
Yeah.

31:07.946 --> 31:10.540
Well, that means l know
when you're crying for real...

31:10.715 --> 31:15.118
...and when you're faking it. Bye-bye.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.753
What?

31:16.922 --> 31:18.480
God, Milo!

31:18.657 --> 31:21.490
-Do you hear the tone of my voice?
-Oh, God. So good.

31:21.660 --> 31:27.326
Milo! Oh, shoot. Milo? Milo?

31:28.833 --> 31:30.926
Hello, Nicole Hurley.

31:31.102 --> 31:32.626
<i>Hey, hey, it's me. Jimmy.</i>

31:32.804 --> 31:34.931
Jimmy. Oh, my God.

31:35.106 --> 31:37.131
Oh, my God, Jimmy,
l thought you were dead.

31:37.309 --> 31:41.609
Where are you?
l've left you like 40 messages.

31:41.780 --> 31:44.647
Yeah, sorry. My phone ran out.

31:44.816 --> 31:46.147
Listen, about this story--

31:46.318 --> 31:48.252
Jimmy. What happened
at Dunkin' Donuts?

31:48.420 --> 31:50.012
Oh, nothing.

31:50.188 --> 31:53.680
My friend showed up, and he
needed my help with something.

31:53.858 --> 31:55.849
Was that before
he busted your window?

31:56.061 --> 31:58.621
l locked my keys in--
Whatever. lt's a piece of shit.

31:58.797 --> 32:02.164
Listen, hey, where are you?
You sound like you're in a closet.

32:02.701 --> 32:06.501
l'm-- l'm in Atlantic City.

32:06.705 --> 32:11.199
Listen, Jimmy, l went to your apartment,
and l found the coaster.

32:11.376 --> 32:14.641
<i>Has there been evidence stolen
from the depository?</i>

32:14.813 --> 32:17.441
Well, that's kind of why l'm calling.

32:17.616 --> 32:20.608
The whole thing turned out
to be nothing but a waste of time...

32:20.785 --> 32:24.152
-...for everybody involved.
-Who else is involved, Jimmy?

32:25.824 --> 32:26.848
Very good.

32:27.025 --> 32:29.220
Jimmy-- Jimmy?

32:29.961 --> 32:32.020
Listen, l need a favor.

32:32.530 --> 32:34.862
Nicole Hurley, 1 34 Perry Street.

32:35.033 --> 32:37.797
Credit check
and her recent activity, okay?

32:37.969 --> 32:40.529
Beautiful. Thanks.

32:51.383 --> 32:52.543
Nic?

33:21.079 --> 33:25.709
-What the hell happened to you?
-Milo Boyd. Asshole head-butted me.

33:25.884 --> 33:28.148
lf only l gave a shit.

33:28.420 --> 33:30.285
Did you get my money?

33:32.023 --> 33:33.513
Ray!

33:34.426 --> 33:37.020
Milo Boyd. Ex-cop.

33:37.195 --> 33:39.288
Fired last year for neglect of duty.

33:39.464 --> 33:42.365
His current gambling debt
is just over 1 1 grand.

33:42.534 --> 33:45.765
We haven't seen a penny
in two months.

33:46.604 --> 33:47.798
This is not good.

33:47.972 --> 33:51.908
We let this bum slide, people gonna
start thinking lrene's gone soft...

33:52.077 --> 33:53.738
...they don't have to pay up.

33:54.279 --> 33:57.146
Get him in here, Dwight,
break some part of his person...

33:57.315 --> 34:00.409
...l'll get my money, and we'll have
a nice holiday weekend.

34:01.119 --> 34:02.643
Swear to God.

34:02.821 --> 34:04.254
Unbelievable.

34:05.056 --> 34:06.284
How did you find me?

34:06.458 --> 34:11.418
Well, l knew you called your mother,
so l went to see her.

34:11.596 --> 34:15.088
You went to see my mother?
She didn't know l was there.

34:15.266 --> 34:18.063
Yeah, she said you went to
''suck up some luck.''

34:18.737 --> 34:21.103
And l remembered your dad
had some crazy theory...

34:21.272 --> 34:26.141
...about how all the losing at the track
must leave this extra luck lying around.

34:26.311 --> 34:29.507
l knew you'd be in section D
because D is your lucky letter.

34:29.714 --> 34:32.012
l mean, who has a lucky letter?

34:34.319 --> 34:36.583
l had no idea
you knew all that stuff about me.

34:37.222 --> 34:38.587
Of course. We were married.

34:40.291 --> 34:44.659
But honestly, l love being single.
l love everything about my life.

34:44.829 --> 34:46.262
Great job...

34:46.431 --> 34:47.455
...good friends...

34:47.632 --> 34:49.429
...hot girlfriend.

34:49.601 --> 34:51.431
-Girlfriend?
-Oh, you didn't know?

34:51.603 --> 34:57.041
Oh, yeah, l've had a number of casual,
crazy, sex-filled relationships...

34:57.242 --> 35:00.643
...since you and l crapped out.
But l think this lady might be the one.

35:02.113 --> 35:03.808
What's her name?

35:07.385 --> 35:08.750
Teresa.

35:09.554 --> 35:13.149
Smoking hot body.
Yeah. Great cook.

35:13.525 --> 35:15.789
Smart. Very, very smart.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.258
-Smart for a stripper.
-She's not a stripper.

35:19.063 --> 35:20.826
Well, then, what does Teresa do?

35:22.066 --> 35:23.328
-Judge.
-What?

35:23.835 --> 35:25.962
Circuit court of appeals judge.

35:26.137 --> 35:28.901
Oh, bullshit. Bullshit.

35:29.073 --> 35:33.533
No, l'm not bullshitting.
She really is a judge.

35:34.312 --> 35:37.804
Actually, just like the one
you skipped out on.

35:39.651 --> 35:43.178
lt's funny,
the little coincidences in life.

35:54.499 --> 35:56.558
All right, that's it. l'm done.

35:56.734 --> 35:59.999
l give up. l give up.
Just-- l don't wanna play anymore.

36:00.171 --> 36:01.433
Here. Take it.

36:03.341 --> 36:05.070
-What's that?
-Five hundred dollars.

36:05.243 --> 36:07.734
Take it and dump me anywhere
on the side of the road.

36:07.912 --> 36:08.936
Here. l don't care.

36:09.113 --> 36:12.947
Honey, l'm getting 5 grand just to
bring your ass to justice. Do the math.

36:13.117 --> 36:16.018
-No. You do it.
-No.

36:16.187 --> 36:17.415
The Milo Boyd that l knew?

36:17.589 --> 36:20.717
He could take $500,
walk into any casino...

36:20.892 --> 36:23.918
...turn it into $5000 like that.

36:24.095 --> 36:27.087
-He could turn it into $ 1 0,000.
-Yeah, try 50.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.631
l don't know. l wouldn't go that far.

36:31.436 --> 36:34.405
-Why not?
-l don't know. You think you still got it?

36:34.572 --> 36:36.540
Hell, yeah, l still got it.

36:40.044 --> 36:42.535
You know,
this isn't about the money.

36:43.147 --> 36:46.605
No, this is about me doing my job.

36:54.492 --> 36:58.622
All right. Now, listen.
Remember: you win, you let me go.

36:58.796 --> 37:00.593
That's our deal. Right?

37:00.765 --> 37:02.665
You get what you want,
and l get to go--

37:02.867 --> 37:07.895
Don't tell me your story.
How could l forget? Come on.

37:11.476 --> 37:17.142
Yeah, l found you.
God, Stewart, you are a huge stud.

37:17.315 --> 37:21.012
Dwight, be honest. Apart from chasing
some guy down, breaking his legs...

37:21.185 --> 37:25.281
...beating his face to a bloody pulp,
you don't get a lot of aerobic exercise.

37:25.456 --> 37:28.323
-Why we talking about this?
-You're gonna get me killed...

37:28.493 --> 37:31.485
...when you're too slow to react
in a life-and-death situation.

37:31.663 --> 37:33.290
l am not too slow.

37:34.933 --> 37:36.696
lt's lrene.

37:37.302 --> 37:39.429
<i>-Yeah?
-They spotted Boyd at the Taj.</i>

37:39.604 --> 37:42.198
<i>-He's driving a blue Delta 88.
-l'm on it.</i>

37:42.407 --> 37:44.170
Okay, listen, there's this kid.

37:44.342 --> 37:47.505
He works at O'Doul's.
He gives me information sometimes.

37:47.679 --> 37:49.647
-You mean he's a snitch.
-Yes.

37:49.814 --> 37:51.441
l think he's in a lot of trouble.

37:51.616 --> 37:55.108
l had him ask about this suicide,
this guy that dove off of a roof.

37:55.286 --> 37:56.446
Shows me what you know.

37:56.621 --> 37:59.419
-What?
-Suicides don't dive. They go feet-first.

38:00.525 --> 38:02.322
ls that true? How do you know that?

38:02.493 --> 38:04.222
Every cop knows that.

38:04.429 --> 38:08.388
Well, if every cop
knows that a suicide goes feet-first...

38:08.566 --> 38:13.003
...and this guy went headfirst, then
why would a cop rule it as a suicide?

38:13.171 --> 38:14.900
-How the hell should l know?
-Well--

38:15.073 --> 38:17.940
Why don't you ask the cop
that filled out the report?

38:27.819 --> 38:28.843
Nicole.

38:29.654 --> 38:32.179
Nicole, it's Stewart.
l'm here to save you.

38:34.759 --> 38:36.750
Oh, my God. She's passed out.

38:36.961 --> 38:39.691
All right, hero time. Let's go, buddy.

38:40.531 --> 38:43.022
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

38:43.201 --> 38:44.930
Okay, here you go. l got you.

38:45.103 --> 38:48.402
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

38:49.273 --> 38:50.831
Hey.

38:52.910 --> 38:53.934
lt's a Delta 88.

38:54.112 --> 38:55.272
-Yeah.
-lt's a nice car.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.539
Oh, thank you. Yeah, no, this is....

38:57.715 --> 38:59.740
This is my car,
in case you were wondering.

39:00.251 --> 39:01.548
Yeah.

39:01.719 --> 39:05.280
lt was once used in
a lce Cube video.

39:05.490 --> 39:06.889
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:07.058 --> 39:09.288
Yeah. You a big fan of cars?

39:10.361 --> 39:13.990
What l love about it is that it actually--
The steering wheel--

39:17.802 --> 39:19.292
Five hundred on the pass line.

39:19.504 --> 39:21.631
New shooter.
Five hundred on the line.

39:21.806 --> 39:24.707
Wait a minute. You're betting all of it?
What if you lose?

39:24.876 --> 39:26.707
Then we're back in the car.

39:26.878 --> 39:28.812
So if l lose, l still win.

39:30.114 --> 39:32.446
-Here. Blow on them.
-No.

39:33.384 --> 39:35.215
-You always did before.
-Oh, come on.

39:35.386 --> 39:38.753
You want me to win, don't you?
lf l win, you go free, remember?

39:39.457 --> 39:42.119
-Let's go, let's go.
-Let's go, shooter. Coming out.

39:46.330 --> 39:47.422
Here we go.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.602
-Winner. Seven.
-Seven. Big winner.

39:57.075 --> 39:58.633
Winner. Eleven.

39:58.810 --> 40:01.608
-Yes. Eleven.
-Front-line winner.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.248
Winner, seven.

40:10.822 --> 40:12.187
Seven.

40:18.196 --> 40:20.630
Winner, eleven.

40:22.867 --> 40:24.698
Count it out nice and slow.

40:24.869 --> 40:26.598
Eight grand. lt's so beautiful.

40:26.771 --> 40:28.705
You did it.
l said you could and you did.

40:28.873 --> 40:30.534
l'm out of here. You win, l walk.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.699
What? Wait.
What are you talking about?

40:32.877 --> 40:34.538
-Where you going?
-Are you kidding?

40:34.712 --> 40:36.270
We had a deal.

40:36.447 --> 40:38.506
You win 5 and l get to walk.

40:38.683 --> 40:39.877
No, you said 1 0.

40:40.818 --> 40:42.786
l said 5, Milo.

40:42.954 --> 40:47.186
ln the car, you said l could turn 500
into 1 0,000.

40:47.358 --> 40:49.690
-Yes. But first l had said--
-No ''buts.''

40:49.861 --> 40:52.159
Come on. Why would l try
and win 5 thousand...

40:52.330 --> 40:54.628
...when l get 5 thousand
for turning you in?

40:54.799 --> 40:57.290
-Doesn't make sense.
-You know what does make sense?

40:57.468 --> 41:03.168
-l'm leaving. That's it. l'm out of here.
-Hey, no. You will stay here...

41:03.341 --> 41:06.640
...until l win 1 0 grand
and then you walk. Okay?

41:06.811 --> 41:08.836
You have my word. Now blow.

41:09.013 --> 41:10.844
Your word is worth shit.

41:11.015 --> 41:12.346
Let's go, shooter.

41:15.419 --> 41:19.685
You know what? Fine. l can
do this myself. lt's all me, anyway.

41:19.857 --> 41:22.189
Watch. Milo Boyd
makes his own luck.

41:22.693 --> 41:23.751
Yeah, here we go.

41:25.997 --> 41:27.931
Four. Easy. The point is four.

41:28.132 --> 41:29.497
Okay, four. lt's okay.

41:29.667 --> 41:34.229
No worries. l can do four.
That's two twos...

41:34.405 --> 41:37.863
-...a three and a one.
-Yeah. Or a four and a zero.

41:38.042 --> 41:39.134
Shut up.

41:41.078 --> 41:41.212
Of course you're to blame.
A four and a zero?

41:41.212 --> 41:43.407
Of course you're to blame.
A four and a zero?

41:43.581 --> 41:45.674
-God.
-You mocked the gods of craps.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.943
''The gods of craps''?
Do you hear yourself?

41:48.152 --> 41:52.521
No. All l hear is the sound of $8000
in chips being swept away from me.

41:52.690 --> 41:55.022
Milo. Milo, you have got to let me go.

41:55.193 --> 41:58.060
No, l don't have to do anything
except win my money back...

41:58.229 --> 42:01.460
...which l will do
as soon as l can find the damn room.

42:12.109 --> 42:15.545
This place is nice.

42:15.713 --> 42:17.772
Yeah. Glad you like it.

42:17.949 --> 42:19.211
Because you paid for it.

42:19.383 --> 42:21.817
-l--? Me?
-Yeah. l lifted your credit card.

42:21.986 --> 42:24.819
Pretty shitty thing to do.
l feel better now that you know.

42:24.989 --> 42:29.153
-You stole my credit card?
-See, that's what you always do.

42:29.327 --> 42:32.057
You know, l borrow your card,
and it turns into stealing.

42:32.230 --> 42:34.221
You always blow things
out of proportion.

42:34.398 --> 42:37.458
You know what, would you stop it
with this ''always'' crap?

42:37.635 --> 42:41.731
We dated for six months.
We were married for nine months.

42:41.906 --> 42:44.067
That is 1 5 months, okay?

42:44.242 --> 42:46.403
That is not ''always,'' champ.

42:46.577 --> 42:50.138
You don't even know ''always.''
Hey, what are you doing? What's--?

42:50.314 --> 42:51.941
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

42:52.116 --> 42:54.812
Milo, don't you dare
leave me here like this. Milo.

42:58.222 --> 43:00.986
-You'll probably have to pay for that.
-You know what?

43:19.176 --> 43:21.144
Don't let me down.

44:52.036 --> 44:53.867
-What are you doing?
-What?

44:57.274 --> 44:58.764
Are you trying to seduce me?

45:03.848 --> 45:06.043
Yeah. l am.

45:14.892 --> 45:17.360
What would you like to touch first?

45:18.229 --> 45:19.787
You always loved my shoulders.

45:19.964 --> 45:22.228
Oh, yes, your shoulders.

45:22.400 --> 45:27.099
And especially in the right jacket?
So impressive.

45:27.271 --> 45:28.295
My chest.

45:30.374 --> 45:33.275
So strong, so solid.

45:34.278 --> 45:38.271
-My lips.
-Your lips.

45:38.449 --> 45:42.681
A perfect match for mine.

45:44.021 --> 45:47.422
What you'd really like
to touch first...

45:48.692 --> 45:50.626
...is powerful.

45:51.429 --> 45:53.659
Sometimes dangerous.

45:54.765 --> 45:57.393
-lt's hard.
-Yes.

45:58.936 --> 46:01.268
And that would be my gun.

46:02.106 --> 46:07.100
Oh, you're such a dick.
You are such a dick.

46:07.278 --> 46:09.940
Yeah. But in the right jacket....

46:24.528 --> 46:27.019
Ray wants to show you something.

46:34.171 --> 46:37.629
Okay. All right. Okay, yeah.
Okay, bring your buddies in.

46:37.808 --> 46:39.400
Now that l have your attention...

46:39.577 --> 46:42.671
...l will have you know that my
college roommate is a partner...

46:42.847 --> 46:45.748
...at the biggest law firm
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

46:45.950 --> 46:49.215
All right, and while they specialize
primarily in real estate law...

46:49.386 --> 46:52.150
<i>...l am calling him mañana.</i>

46:52.323 --> 46:54.985
And he will be on your asses
like white on rice.

46:55.826 --> 46:57.521
Pick something and break it.

46:59.530 --> 47:02.021
No, hold on one sec.
l don't know him that well.

47:02.199 --> 47:04.827
We're not-- We dated
some of the same girls in college.

47:05.002 --> 47:08.904
Hey. Hey, is that a Ping?
A Rapture? l had--

47:09.073 --> 47:14.511
Oh, shit. God. Shit.

47:14.678 --> 47:16.942
-Feel better?
-Yeah, l do, actually.

47:17.114 --> 47:18.775
-Damn it.
-Who is this guy, anyway?

47:18.983 --> 47:21.383
-Where's Boyd?
-That's Boyd.

47:21.552 --> 47:22.712
That's not Milo Boyd.

47:22.887 --> 47:24.878
-l'm not Boyd.
-He was in Boyd's Oldsmobile.

47:25.055 --> 47:26.522
l'm not Boyd.

47:26.690 --> 47:29.682
The two of you go together
this time. Morons.

47:35.533 --> 47:37.899
-Housekeeping.
-Oh, good, yes. Come in.

47:39.570 --> 47:41.231
Good morning.

47:42.573 --> 47:46.065
You're probably wondering
why l'm handcuffed to the bed.

47:46.243 --> 47:49.770
l just came from a room where a man
was lying in a bathtub of mayonnaise...

47:49.947 --> 47:51.073
...wearing a dog collar.

47:52.416 --> 47:54.577
-Well, to each his own.
-You're not the one...

47:54.752 --> 47:57.550
-...who has to clean the tub.
-That's a very good point.

47:57.721 --> 47:59.052
-l'll come back.
-No. Please.

47:59.223 --> 48:02.317
Would you mind grabbing my bag
from over there, please.

48:29.853 --> 48:30.979
What was that?

48:31.689 --> 48:33.816
What? Sorry? What? What was what?

48:35.326 --> 48:36.816
That.

48:39.063 --> 48:42.191
Listen, l have to
go to the bathroom, please.

48:42.366 --> 48:43.458
Can you--?

48:44.969 --> 48:46.869
How did you sleep?

48:47.838 --> 48:49.931
-Better than you.
-Jerk.

48:52.009 --> 48:53.499
-Would you--?
-Sorry.

49:01.018 --> 49:03.111
What are you doing?
Can l have some privacy?

49:03.287 --> 49:05.221
Something tells me
l should frisk you.

49:05.389 --> 49:06.617
Oh, right.

49:06.790 --> 49:09.350
Do l look like l'm hiding a weapon
between my breasts?

49:15.099 --> 49:16.964
Seriously.

49:17.501 --> 49:20.629
-Do you mind?
-Okay, okay.

49:21.105 --> 49:22.629
God.

49:25.109 --> 49:26.872
''Max power button.

49:27.044 --> 49:30.343
Put open end in direct contact
with the skin.

49:30.514 --> 49:32.243
Press button.''

49:32.416 --> 49:35.214
-Hey, who you talking to?
-Nobody.

49:35.686 --> 49:38.553
Who would l be talking to
in a bathroom, anyway? God.

49:38.722 --> 49:41.020
Okay, you're up to something.
l'm coming in.

49:41.191 --> 49:42.988
-No, l'm not done, Milo.
-You're done.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.253
Nope, l'm not. Jesus.

50:06.717 --> 50:08.052
Son of a--

50:08.886 --> 50:10.114
<i>Did you really jump bail?</i>

50:10.287 --> 50:13.279
Gary, l need the name of the cop
who signed off on the suicide.

50:13.957 --> 50:17.723
Okay. Looking like...

50:17.895 --> 50:21.296
-...Bobby Jenkins.
-Bobby?

50:21.465 --> 50:22.591
Are you sure?

50:22.766 --> 50:24.028
l'm reading it right here.

50:24.201 --> 50:26.897
-Do you know where Stewart is?
-Why would l know that?

50:27.071 --> 50:28.868
l thought you two were together.

50:29.039 --> 50:31.735
We are not together.
We made out once.

50:32.976 --> 50:35.877
l meant together on the story.

50:36.046 --> 50:40.608
-You made out with Stewart?
-Hey, you know-- Gary, that's it.

50:42.986 --> 50:44.920
-Need a lift?
-What?

50:45.956 --> 50:49.483
Yes, yes, l do. Oh, God.

50:51.061 --> 50:53.291
What a nightmare.

50:53.497 --> 50:55.488
Don't get married.

50:55.766 --> 51:00.635
l'm 1 7. l don't even have a girlfriend.
l'm saving all my money for college.

51:04.408 --> 51:08.811
You know what? l just gave
all of my money to my ex-husband.

51:08.979 --> 51:11.277
l don't know
how l'm gonna pay you.

51:12.249 --> 51:14.240
You could show me your boobs.

51:14.418 --> 51:15.442
Excuse me?

51:15.619 --> 51:18.179
l told you l don't have a girlfriend.
Give me a break.

51:18.355 --> 51:20.516
Show me your boobs.

51:22.993 --> 51:24.255
All right, pull over.

51:26.163 --> 51:27.528
You serious?

51:30.167 --> 51:32.135
Watch out. Watch out, watch out.

51:32.302 --> 51:35.430
Come on, bring it back.
My boss, she's gonna kill me.

51:35.606 --> 51:37.597
Show her your penis.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.803
Taser this, baby.

52:41.438 --> 52:42.530
Get in the car.

52:47.711 --> 52:49.008
Come on, come on.

52:56.587 --> 52:59.784
Are you serious? Really?
Right now, you're gonna do this?

52:59.957 --> 53:03.916
l promise,
l promise l won't do it again.

53:04.695 --> 53:06.128
Come on.

53:19.109 --> 53:21.202
Cannot believe
l was ever married to you.

53:21.378 --> 53:24.905
l don't know why you keep falling
for that old ''get in the car'' trick.

53:32.990 --> 53:34.457
What?

53:38.462 --> 53:40.157
Oh, what are you doing?

53:42.399 --> 53:46.733
No. No, no, no.
No, l'm not buying it. No--

53:53.010 --> 53:55.444
Oh, shit. That's real.

54:01.184 --> 54:03.584
Nicole, come on, let's go.

54:08.992 --> 54:12.519
-Look, l was just fooling around.
-Not because of you, jerk.

54:34.551 --> 54:36.485
Shit.

55:06.516 --> 55:08.541
Oh, thank God. A doctor.

55:08.719 --> 55:11.153
Sir, my leg, l think it's broken...

55:11.321 --> 55:16.088
...and all l've eaten today is a
doughnut. That is --That is quite large.

55:16.259 --> 55:18.420
Wait a minute.
Wait, you are a doctor, right?

55:18.595 --> 55:21.996
Of course. l'm the track vet
at Atlantic City Race Course.

55:22.165 --> 55:23.689
-What?
-He's very good.

55:23.867 --> 55:26.199
He just put down
one of our horses last week.

55:26.370 --> 55:28.998
-l don't think it felt a thing.
-But l'm not a horse.

55:29.172 --> 55:33.438
Well, actually, in that case,
it did feel it. A lot.

55:33.610 --> 55:35.407
Well, those are the tough ones.

55:35.579 --> 55:39.242
Okay, you are gonna feel
a massive pinch.

55:39.416 --> 55:41.748
But then your leg
should feel just fine.

55:41.918 --> 55:43.215
Don't-- Don't--

55:51.561 --> 55:53.290
Come on, is this really necessary?

55:53.497 --> 55:56.864
After 250 volts through my neck?
You're lucky you're not in the trunk.

55:57.034 --> 55:59.468
l feel like l got a hickey
from jumper cables.

55:59.636 --> 56:03.128
-You know, l could arrest you for this.
-Great. Do it, l dare you.

56:03.306 --> 56:05.968
Wait, you'd have to be a real cop.
Which, by the way...

56:06.143 --> 56:08.543
...was the single most attractive thing
about you.

56:08.712 --> 56:11.146
l can go back to being a cop
any time l want.

56:11.314 --> 56:12.804
Yeah, right.

56:13.016 --> 56:14.483
-You know why?
-Why?

56:14.651 --> 56:17.017
Because l'm good at it, that's why.

56:20.590 --> 56:21.887
l disagree with you.

56:22.059 --> 56:24.391
-And you're basing that on?
-Based on the fact...

56:24.561 --> 56:27.894
...that there's a black SUV following us,
and you haven't even noticed.

56:29.633 --> 56:32.295
-Who says he's following us?
-lt's the same one l saw...

56:32.469 --> 56:34.733
...at Dunkin' Donuts
when l went to meet Jimmy.

56:34.905 --> 56:38.397
There are a million black SUVs
and 20 million Dunkin' Donuts...

56:38.575 --> 56:40.941
-...and that's just in New Jersey.
-Listen.

56:41.111 --> 56:44.274
There is a very good chance
cops are involved in the story...

56:44.448 --> 56:46.075
-...that l'm working on.
-Suicide?

56:46.249 --> 56:49.514
They grabbed Jimmy. Jimmy may have
given them my name. l don't know.

56:49.686 --> 56:52.280
-They may wanna kill me.
-You think you're hot shit...

56:52.456 --> 56:55.619
...but l'm sure the only person
that wants to kill you is me.

56:55.792 --> 56:58.260
-God! Look out. Go.
-What the hell are you doing?

57:03.867 --> 57:04.925
God. Shit.

57:08.271 --> 57:10.034
Why don't you ever listen to me?

57:10.207 --> 57:11.936
-l do listen, but--
-No, you don't.

57:20.951 --> 57:22.612
Look out.

57:30.727 --> 57:32.456
Don't stop.

57:34.030 --> 57:35.327
Milo!

57:51.148 --> 57:55.983
-Yes. l am so onto some--
-Only you could be happy right now.

57:56.153 --> 57:57.177
-Milo--
-Stay here.

57:57.354 --> 58:00.414
No, don't you leave me here, Milo.
Get me out of here. Milo.

58:01.825 --> 58:03.417
Shit.

58:29.019 --> 58:31.249
-Jesus.
-Christ.

58:31.421 --> 58:33.082
l told you to stay in the car.

58:33.256 --> 58:35.247
So, what?
You are not the boss of me.

58:35.425 --> 58:37.916
-You're gonna pay for that.
-l owe you a nickel.

58:38.094 --> 58:41.222
Stop the car. Get out.
Get out of there.

58:41.398 --> 58:42.660
Shit.

58:44.034 --> 58:46.127
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

58:46.303 --> 58:49.704
-Really? Now you're interested?
-Yeah, hell, yeah. He shot up my car.

58:50.540 --> 58:52.474
l told you
someone was following me.

58:52.676 --> 58:55.372
Did you listen to me? No.
Do you ever listen to me?

58:55.545 --> 58:57.945
You told me
somebody jumped off a roof.

58:58.114 --> 59:01.572
He worked for the N.Y.P.D.
in the evidence depository.

59:01.751 --> 59:05.619
He was afraid of heights and
it's still ruled as a suicide? Come on.

59:05.789 --> 59:08.553
You know, you can tell me all this
on the way to jail.

59:08.725 --> 59:11.057
-You can't be serious.
-Oh, you wanna bet?

59:11.228 --> 59:12.559
Bobby signed the report.

59:14.097 --> 59:15.291
What?

59:15.465 --> 59:18.093
Bobby was the cop who signed off
on the suicide.

59:18.268 --> 59:22.170
-The same one that you said--
-Watch yourself. Very thin ice here.

59:22.339 --> 59:25.672
-He is my friend too.
-What is this? A friendly accusation?

59:25.842 --> 59:29.243
No, this is not an accusation.
This is simply connecting the dots.

59:29.412 --> 59:31.778
No, this is about you
caring about someone...

59:31.948 --> 59:33.347
...then, all of a sudden...

59:33.516 --> 59:36.815
...no warning, you don't care
about him and you're out the door.

59:36.987 --> 59:39.820
-This is not about us, Milo.
-Bobby.

59:39.990 --> 59:41.617
Bobby walked you down the aisle.

59:41.791 --> 59:44.919
l know. l will be heartbroken.
But l am not gonna stand around...

59:45.095 --> 59:46.426
...with my head in the sand.

59:46.596 --> 59:49.429
l know where your head is,
and it ain't in the sand.

59:49.599 --> 59:51.863
-What are you doing?
-l'm gonna find this prick.

59:52.035 --> 59:54.128
When l do,
l'm gonna prove Bobby innocent...

59:54.304 --> 59:57.171
...and show you
exactly what loyalty looks like.

59:59.342 --> 01:00:02.368
No VlN number. No registration.

01:00:02.545 --> 01:00:05.878
Yeah, this guy was definitely a pro.

01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:08.984
Well, l got a Starbucks cup
with the name Earl on it.

01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:12.986
Well, maybe it's not his cup.
ls that all you've got?

01:00:13.156 --> 01:00:16.057
More than you've got, Kojak.

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:21.391
-l got these.
-What does it matter that he plays golf?

01:00:21.564 --> 01:00:23.327
You see, l don't think he does.

01:00:24.467 --> 01:00:26.128
These clubs have barely been used.

01:00:26.303 --> 01:00:29.067
Plus, they're lefties.

01:00:29.272 --> 01:00:31.001
The guy who shot at us was a righty.

01:00:31.174 --> 01:00:34.575
Not to mention the fact
that all the pockets are empty.

01:00:34.778 --> 01:00:35.802
So what?

01:00:35.979 --> 01:00:37.742
There is not a golfer in the world...

01:00:37.914 --> 01:00:42.248
...who doesn't have tees and pencils
and balls, shoes, you name it.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.744
Why is he a member...

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:48.880
-...at the Castle Hill Country Club?
-That is a good question.

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:50.856
That's why l asked it.

01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:53.392
For once, that is a good question.

01:01:05.408 --> 01:01:07.535
All right, here's the deal.

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:10.578
We're interested
in becoming members of the club...

01:01:10.747 --> 01:01:12.874
...and we are friends with John.

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:14.678
Okay. John who?

01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:18.582
Just say John.
They fill in the last name.

01:01:19.322 --> 01:01:22.587
-Clever.
-Thank you. Works every time.

01:01:22.759 --> 01:01:25.557
All right, now you have to come up
with an occupation.

01:01:25.729 --> 01:01:27.890
Why can't l be who l am?

01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:29.721
A bounty hunter?

01:01:29.899 --> 01:01:33.391
We're trying to get into a private club,
not a tractor pull.

01:01:35.705 --> 01:01:37.969
Oh, gosh, l'm so sorry.

01:01:38.141 --> 01:01:41.235
The club's closed today
for a private event for members.

01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:43.345
lt's the Fourth of July.

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.107
ls it?

01:01:48.284 --> 01:01:51.117
lt's already the fourth, honey.

01:01:51.287 --> 01:01:53.152
l can't believe it, honey.

01:01:53.356 --> 01:01:54.755
Well, honey, neither can l.

01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:58.223
See, the thing is John actually said
that it would be all right...

01:01:58.395 --> 01:01:59.623
...if we stopped by today.

01:01:59.796 --> 01:02:01.457
John...?

01:02:01.631 --> 01:02:03.792
He's a member here.

01:02:04.768 --> 01:02:06.759
You know John.

01:02:06.936 --> 01:02:09.404
-Everybody knows John.
-Big John.

01:02:09.572 --> 01:02:11.631
l'm actually
the membership director here...

01:02:11.808 --> 01:02:14.641
...and l don't believe we have
a single member named John.

01:02:16.179 --> 01:02:18.409
That's weird, honey.

01:02:18.581 --> 01:02:21.141
-This never fails.
-Oh, wait.

01:02:21.317 --> 01:02:24.980
Do you mean Jack Willit? They call him
Jack, but l think his name's John.

01:02:25.155 --> 01:02:29.421
-Yes. Big John Jack Willit.
-Big John. Yeah, how could l forget.

01:02:29.592 --> 01:02:32.857
After all the years that John and l
have actually worked together...

01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:36.988
-...l forget people still call him Jack.
-Jack.

01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:40.261
Oh, you're also in the Senate?

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:43.196
Yes.

01:02:44.007 --> 01:02:45.975
Which state?

01:02:47.143 --> 01:02:48.633
-Okla--
-Kansas.

01:02:50.547 --> 01:02:52.674
Kansas.

01:02:55.418 --> 01:02:59.411
Well, what a pleasure,
Senator and Mrs. Boyd.

01:02:59.956 --> 01:03:03.824
Let me find someone who'll give you
the grand tour. Lucky us...

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:06.359
...another celebrity at Castle Hill.

01:03:08.231 --> 01:03:09.892
l'm actually a former model.

01:03:10.066 --> 01:03:11.624
Really?

01:03:12.135 --> 01:03:13.534
How long ago was that?

01:03:15.138 --> 01:03:19.074
Why don't you just find that person
that will be giving us the tour.

01:03:20.343 --> 01:03:22.368
Just stay right here.

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:25.170
l'll be back in two shakes.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.981
All right, so let's split up.

01:03:29.152 --> 01:03:32.986
l take the tennis courts and the pool,
and you take the pro shop.

01:03:33.156 --> 01:03:36.922
You're just gonna run around asking
people if they know a guy named Earl?

01:03:37.093 --> 01:03:39.891
Well, do you have a better idea?

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.590
Learn from me, honey. You wanna
know every dirty little thing...

01:03:43.766 --> 01:03:47.395
...that goes on at a country club,
you gotta ask the right people.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.595
Who would that be?

01:03:50.907 --> 01:03:51.999
The caddies.

01:03:52.742 --> 01:03:53.766
-Hey there.
-Yeah?

01:03:53.977 --> 01:03:55.376
-What's going on?
-Hey.

01:03:55.545 --> 01:03:59.345
Hey, do any of you fellas
know a guy named Earl?

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:01.281
No?

01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:04.386
Hey.

01:04:05.688 --> 01:04:08.248
-l'll take that as a yes.
-Wait. Where are you--?

01:04:08.424 --> 01:04:10.722
Milo!

01:04:22.438 --> 01:04:23.496
Shit.

01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:31.945
A little out of shape there, senator?

01:04:32.115 --> 01:04:33.742
The kid's got 20 years on me.

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:36.715
-Oh, come on, get in the cart.
-Only if you let me drive.

01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:39.753
-What is that supposed to mean?
-That you're a sucky driver.

01:04:39.923 --> 01:04:43.256
l am-- l am not a sucky driver.
l'm a great driver.

01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:46.520
You know what? l don't have time
for this. Get in here. Come on.

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:52.394
How could we lose him?

01:04:52.769 --> 01:04:55.260
He knows the course
better than we do.

01:04:56.072 --> 01:04:57.562
Gentlemen.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.971
There.

01:05:11.421 --> 01:05:13.286
Stay with him.

01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:16.020
-God. Milo.
-Get right up next to him.

01:05:16.192 --> 01:05:19.059
-We're moving too fast. Oh, no.
-No.

01:05:20.129 --> 01:05:21.994
l got you. l got you.

01:05:25.134 --> 01:05:26.829
That was not my fault.

01:05:27.003 --> 01:05:29.028
l don't know anything.
The drugs, the cash.

01:05:29.205 --> 01:05:32.538
-l didn't know anything about it.
-l didn't ask about drugs or money.

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:34.802
Good. l don't know anything.
l'm a caddy.

01:05:34.978 --> 01:05:39.278
-Well, then why were you running?
-Look, l'm just a kid saving for college.

01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:41.007
Fine!

01:05:41.184 --> 01:05:43.516
A Jet Ski, l'm saving for a Jet Ski.

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:44.778
Who's Earl?

01:05:45.622 --> 01:05:47.783
Okay, look, all l know is,
he plays here...

01:05:47.957 --> 01:05:51.154
...with a couple big shots
every three or four months.

01:05:51.327 --> 01:05:54.524
Dude doesn't know the difference
between a wedge and a paddle.

01:05:54.697 --> 01:05:56.028
What's his last name?

01:05:56.199 --> 01:05:58.167
l don't know anything about him.

01:05:58.334 --> 01:06:00.894
Why don't you use your college brain
and think.

01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:04.005
You can drown me.
l'm not gonna know his last name.

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:06.232
And he's a big tipper,
sometimes 1 00 bucks.

01:06:06.409 --> 01:06:09.378
Oh, he got me this.

01:06:09.612 --> 01:06:10.909
He got you a tattoo?

01:06:11.114 --> 01:06:13.048
When my girlfriend
dumped me, yeah.

01:06:13.216 --> 01:06:15.411
He sent me to this place in Queens.
Blue lnk.

01:06:15.618 --> 01:06:17.643
l don't know, maybe he owns it.

01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:23.819
Blue lnk Tattoo.

01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:25.324
<i>Yeah, let me speak to Earl.</i>

01:06:25.495 --> 01:06:26.519
Not in.

01:06:26.696 --> 01:06:30.257
-We got him.
-Tell him a Walter Lilly called.

01:06:31.067 --> 01:06:33.831
Tell him Walter Lilly called,
all right?

01:06:34.003 --> 01:06:37.564
All right. Walter Lilly? Thanks.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.573
Very nice work, detective.

01:06:40.743 --> 01:06:42.711
Hey, you--

01:06:43.179 --> 01:06:45.511
-You got some--
-What?

01:06:45.682 --> 01:06:46.706
-Some--
-What?

01:06:46.883 --> 01:06:48.180
-On your neck.
-What is it?

01:06:48.351 --> 01:06:50.114
-lt's pond scum.
-Get it off. Oh, God.

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:52.880
-Looks good.
-Get it off. Milo, get it off. Not funny.

01:06:53.056 --> 01:06:56.150
-Okay. Calm down, calm down.
-Get it.

01:06:56.592 --> 01:06:58.719
What else? Where else is it?

01:06:58.895 --> 01:07:01.386
-Wanna see it? Look.
-Just get it out of the car.

01:07:01.564 --> 01:07:04.431
-l'm gonna keep it. Press it in a book.
-Oh, Jesus.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.262
l'll always remember the special day
we just had.

01:07:07.437 --> 01:07:10.133
See, you joke, Milo,
but just look at us.

01:07:10.306 --> 01:07:14.572
We're this close to solving a murder
that nobody even knows has happened.

01:07:17.046 --> 01:07:19.981
-Speak of the devil.
-Really?

01:07:21.284 --> 01:07:23.149
Hey, Bobby, what's up?

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:25.253
Get off the road, and l mean now.

01:07:25.421 --> 01:07:28.413
Yeah, this holiday traffic's--

01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:31.560
-lt's a real bitch.
-Half of New Jersey is looking for you.

01:07:31.728 --> 01:07:34.993
The other half is looking for your ex,
who is apparently a felon.

01:07:35.198 --> 01:07:36.426
For what, l have no idea.

01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:39.727
So much for ''what happens
in Jersey, stays in Jersey.''

01:07:39.902 --> 01:07:41.597
Where are you, man? Exactly?

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.739
What?

01:07:45.908 --> 01:07:49.400
Listen, Bobby, maybe you and l
should meet for a beer later.

01:07:49.579 --> 01:07:52.070
You know, talk about old times.

01:07:52.248 --> 01:07:55.581
Goddamn it, Milo. l can only
protect you if you do what l say.

01:07:55.752 --> 01:07:59.210
And right now l am telling you:
lay low, stay there.

01:08:01.758 --> 01:08:04.352
-What?
-He says we should get off the road.

01:08:04.527 --> 01:08:07.758
-l believe him.
-We are in the middle of nowhere.

01:08:08.264 --> 01:08:09.754
You know what?

01:08:11.501 --> 01:08:13.662
l know exactly where we are.

01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:23.804
Really? Here?

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:26.505
Couldn't have driven five minutes,
found a Best Western?

01:08:27.617 --> 01:08:30.051
We'll be safe here
until we figure out what's what.

01:08:30.252 --> 01:08:31.550
Think they remember us?

01:08:31.754 --> 01:08:35.349
You kidding? Do you know how many
honeymooners they've had since us?

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.185
Hey, can l help--?

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:40.890
Wait.

01:08:41.063 --> 01:08:42.496
lt can't be.

01:08:42.665 --> 01:08:45.133
Edmund. Edmund. Come quick.

01:08:45.835 --> 01:08:48.133
-Looks like they remember us.
-You think?

01:08:48.304 --> 01:08:50.636
Be still, my beating heart.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.705
Oh, my.

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:56.902
Listen, we get a lot
of young marrieds here, but you two....

01:08:57.078 --> 01:09:01.140
Have we ever had a couple
more madly in love than these two?

01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:04.013
No. No, we still talk about you two...

01:09:04.187 --> 01:09:08.214
...honest to Betsy, as the
quintessential Cupid's couple Cabin.

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:09.881
Cupid's Cabin couple.

01:09:10.059 --> 01:09:11.822
Oh, you know.

01:09:11.993 --> 01:09:14.484
Let's get you a nice room.
Come on inside.

01:09:18.533 --> 01:09:19.728
Welcome back.

01:09:19.902 --> 01:09:21.392
Welcome. Welcome, welcome.

01:09:21.571 --> 01:09:23.663
Oh, look, here's....

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.804
Oh, my goodness.

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:30.667
What, it's been three years?

01:09:30.846 --> 01:09:35.750
-Three years. Has it?
-Oh, my God. l don't even remember.

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:39.752
So you came back
for your anniversary.

01:09:41.424 --> 01:09:44.723
l do have to ask you
my favorite question.

01:09:44.894 --> 01:09:48.091
How do you keep
your romance alive?

01:09:51.834 --> 01:09:55.429
Well, l gotta tell you, Dawn...

01:09:55.605 --> 01:09:58.472
...l'm not naturally
a romantic kind of guy.

01:09:59.408 --> 01:10:00.432
True. He's not.

01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:04.774
l mean, l don't tend to go
for cards or flowers.

01:10:04.947 --> 01:10:06.278
Actually, gifts of any kind.

01:10:06.449 --> 01:10:10.476
lf it's your birthday, Milo thinks
the best surprise is the gift of nothing.

01:10:11.754 --> 01:10:14.621
And you'd probably have to put a gun
to old Nic's head here...

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:17.224
...to get her to actually say,
''l love you.''

01:10:20.863 --> 01:10:23.457
Well, that's true love.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:30.300
That is right. Two people who know
all each other's faults...

01:10:30.473 --> 01:10:33.965
-...and weaknesses, and yet--
-They just love each other all the more.

01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:35.633
Thank you.

01:10:36.812 --> 01:10:38.803
Oh, gosh.

01:10:39.382 --> 01:10:41.612
The cesspool's backed up.
Gotta call the guy.

01:10:41.784 --> 01:10:44.810
No, honey, l think it's them.
They're a little stinky.

01:10:44.987 --> 01:10:48.423
Well, we actually--
We crashed into a pond.

01:10:48.925 --> 01:10:49.949
She was driving.

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:52.322
Oh, my goodness, you two.

01:10:52.495 --> 01:10:55.794
Let's get you settled, and then you
can come back down for dinner.

01:10:55.965 --> 01:10:57.432
We'll get you fresh duds.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.296
Pop those in the wash,
have them back by bedtime.

01:11:00.469 --> 01:11:03.768
Excuse me,
but what happened to your neck?

01:11:04.407 --> 01:11:06.307
She Tasered me.

01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:12.672
She Tase-- He's too funny.

01:11:12.848 --> 01:11:15.612
''She Tasered me.''

01:11:19.355 --> 01:11:21.789
-What?
-Oh, just....

01:11:22.525 --> 01:11:23.992
This whole situation.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.685
l mean, really,
l don't know whether to laugh or cry.

01:11:26.862 --> 01:11:29.296
lf you could see yourself
in that dress, cry.

01:11:29.465 --> 01:11:30.796
What?

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.169
Said the man who couldn't decide what
color to wear, so he wore them all.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.908
Do you remember
when we broke that--?

01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:42.044
Yeah, l do.

01:11:42.445 --> 01:11:45.573
Although l tried very hard
to block that out, to be honest.

01:11:45.748 --> 01:11:47.841
Oh, really?
How's that working out for you?

01:11:48.017 --> 01:11:50.144
-What, being honest?
-Denial.

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:52.310
Great. Yeah.

01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:55.981
Until about an hour ago.

01:11:56.659 --> 01:11:58.320
Yeah.

01:12:01.364 --> 01:12:04.026
Why--? Why do people do that?

01:12:05.368 --> 01:12:06.392
Why do people do what?

01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:09.902
Deny that they've ever done
anything wrong in the relationship.

01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:14.566
Why can't people take responsibility
for their shit and move on?

01:12:15.177 --> 01:12:17.372
Which people are you talking about?

01:12:19.248 --> 01:12:20.272
-l don't know.
-What?

01:12:20.483 --> 01:12:21.973
l don't know.

01:12:23.219 --> 01:12:25.847
You. Me.

01:12:26.522 --> 01:12:28.080
Everybody.

01:12:28.257 --> 01:12:30.384
Well, maybe everybody's afraid...

01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:34.427
...that any admission of guilt
would be seen as a sign of weakness.

01:12:34.597 --> 01:12:37.088
You know,
that's where everybody's wrong.

01:12:37.266 --> 01:12:39.461
l see it as a sign of maturity.

01:12:39.635 --> 01:12:41.364
Don't you think?

01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:44.431
-Absolutely.
-l mean, life--

01:12:44.607 --> 01:12:48.566
Life is about making mistakes.

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:50.302
Right?

01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:54.039
And death is about
wishing you made a whole lot more.

01:12:59.221 --> 01:13:00.415
Hey, l just made that up.

01:13:01.624 --> 01:13:04.115
Look at you, Milo Boyd.

01:13:05.227 --> 01:13:06.819
Well....

01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:09.458
Well, then.

01:13:10.132 --> 01:13:11.599
Here...

01:13:12.134 --> 01:13:16.332
...is to our big, fat, ugly mistake.

01:13:16.539 --> 01:13:18.905
The kind
that knocks you on your ass.

01:13:19.975 --> 01:13:23.138
And makes you wanna
do them all over again.

01:13:28.117 --> 01:13:29.675
What do you mean?

01:13:31.153 --> 01:13:32.814
Well, l--

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:37.755
Well, wait, wait.
What mistake were you talking about?

01:13:37.927 --> 01:13:41.090
No, you just said
you had made a mistake.

01:13:42.331 --> 01:13:43.355
l did.

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:46.259
So we're in agreement?

01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:51.067
But so did you.

01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:58.170
Yeah, so we both
made a huge mistake.

01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:03.882
By getting married.

01:14:05.588 --> 01:14:06.850
Oh, yeah, that. Yeah.

01:14:09.959 --> 01:14:11.085
And getting divorced.

01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:16.323
But you know what?
Hey, l screwed up.

01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:21.095
l screwed up, and l'm sorry.

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:28.976
Sometimes l....

01:14:31.614 --> 01:14:34.549
Sometimes l really think
it was all me.

01:14:38.754 --> 01:14:39.812
This is crazy.

01:14:39.989 --> 01:14:41.513
l know.

01:14:42.758 --> 01:14:44.521
But l kind of....

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:47.025
l kind of miss it.

01:14:48.664 --> 01:14:51.258
-What?
-This.

01:14:52.234 --> 01:14:54.259
Us. You know, you.

01:14:57.873 --> 01:14:59.704
But you don't even like me.

01:15:01.777 --> 01:15:03.870
Are you kidding me?

01:15:04.246 --> 01:15:06.578
Of course l like you.

01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:31.296
What are you thinking about?

01:15:34.977 --> 01:15:36.774
Nothing.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:46.748
Liar.

01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:51.256
That's the nicest thing
you've said to me all weekend.

01:16:03.239 --> 01:16:05.673
Okay. Here you go, Kitty.

01:16:05.841 --> 01:16:08.207
<i>-Hi, it's me.
-Oh, Steve?</i>

01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:11.009
No, it's Nicole. lt's your daughter.
Who's Steve?

01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:14.148
The drag queen who does
Sunday nights. What's up, kitten?

01:16:14.316 --> 01:16:17.114
Mom, advice, advice.
l need your advice.

01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:20.778
Listen, l am locked in the bathroom
of the honeymoon suite...

01:16:20.956 --> 01:16:22.753
...at Cupid's Cabin...

01:16:22.925 --> 01:16:26.122
-...and Milo is right outside the door.
-Lord in heaven.

01:16:26.295 --> 01:16:28.786
You've barricaded
yourself from him?

01:16:28.964 --> 01:16:30.124
That's hot.

01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:33.234
No, Mom-- Okay. Focus.

01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:35.671
Room service.

01:16:37.473 --> 01:16:40.306
l hope l'm not interrupting.
Dawn wanted me to make sure...

01:16:40.476 --> 01:16:44.776
-...you got the rest of your champagne.
-Great. Hang on.

01:16:45.314 --> 01:16:48.181
Your clothes are almost dry.
l'll have them up in a jiffy.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:51.786
No rush. Might not need them
for a little bit, if you know what l mean.

01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:54.255
She must have
a couple of bucks in here.

01:16:58.494 --> 01:17:00.121
What's this?

01:17:05.634 --> 01:17:07.568
Yeah, thanks for the champagne.

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:09.863
Oh, you forgot my--

01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:18.340
So what was this moment
of honesty?

01:17:18.514 --> 01:17:20.345
l don't know.
We were down at dinner...

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:24.008
...and then all of a sudden
l could not remember why l hate him.

01:17:24.186 --> 01:17:25.244
Well, what did he say?

01:17:25.421 --> 01:17:27.412
-He said he missed me.
-What?

01:17:27.589 --> 01:17:30.319
He said he missed me
and that he was sorry.

01:17:30.893 --> 01:17:33.088
He actually said he was sorry?

01:17:33.295 --> 01:17:35.923
Was he taking your clothes off?
How naked were you?

01:17:36.098 --> 01:17:39.192
-Mom, we were on the patio.
-You were naked on the patio?

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:42.098
What can l say,
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

01:17:42.304 --> 01:17:46.104
Ma, we were at dinner on the patio.
There was no sex.

01:17:46.308 --> 01:17:48.674
<i>-And he said ''l'm sorry''?
-Twice.</i>

01:17:48.844 --> 01:17:51.745
-With no sex?
-Yeah.

01:17:51.914 --> 01:17:53.506
Hold on a sec.

01:17:58.921 --> 01:18:00.582
Yeah. Continue.

01:18:00.756 --> 01:18:04.385
l don't know.
Like, she's acting really weird.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.724
l mean, she admitted for the first time
that the divorce was all her fault.

01:18:09.465 --> 01:18:13.458
-Yeah? What'd she say?
-Well, l said l screwed up a little bit.

01:18:13.635 --> 01:18:17.901
But then she said,
''No, Milo, it was me.''

01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:20.439
And then l find this picture?

01:18:20.609 --> 01:18:23.373
Tell me, do you keep your ex's picture
in your wallet?

01:18:23.545 --> 01:18:27.276
Number of times l've been married,
they don't make a wallet that big.

01:18:27.783 --> 01:18:29.944
Come on, pick it up. Let's go.

01:18:30.486 --> 01:18:34.286
-l wanna do more camping.
-This is camping.

01:18:34.456 --> 01:18:37.425
We're camping in Dad's office.

01:18:37.593 --> 01:18:40.585
-Just don't tell your mother about this.
-lt's Milo.

01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:42.956
What's the problem now?

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:45.566
Nicole keeps the wedding photo
in the wallet.

01:18:45.734 --> 01:18:47.895
Numb nuts wants to know
what that means.

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:52.404
l'll tell you what it means. lt means she
hasn't cleaned out her wallet in a year.

01:18:52.574 --> 01:18:56.510
You know, l'm pretty sure l'm carrying
around a condom from 1 98 7.

01:18:56.678 --> 01:18:58.669
Don't tell your mother that, either.

01:18:58.881 --> 01:19:01.873
You know something?
l think that means she loves you.

01:19:03.485 --> 01:19:04.747
l think so too.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.353
Open your eyes, honey.

01:19:06.522 --> 01:19:09.082
<i>How often
do people get second chances?</i>

01:19:09.258 --> 01:19:11.988
<i>l say get naked and get busy.</i>

01:19:12.161 --> 01:19:13.958
You're right.

01:19:14.129 --> 01:19:16.597
<i>-l'm gonna go for it.
-You do that.</i>

01:19:16.765 --> 01:19:19.199
Oh, and take your phone with you.

01:19:19.401 --> 01:19:21.767
One picture of his ass,
that's all l'm asking.

01:19:21.937 --> 01:19:25.168
-Mother, you are so dirty.
-Thank you.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.207
-l love you, sweetie.
-l love you.

01:19:31.313 --> 01:19:33.508
Boy. Okay.

01:19:33.682 --> 01:19:36.947
Well, why do you care?
This woman makes you crazy.

01:19:37.119 --> 01:19:39.349
You drunk yourself out of a job
because of her.

01:19:39.521 --> 01:19:42.012
-No. l quit my job.
-You were fired.

01:19:42.191 --> 01:19:44.421
l quit by getting myself fired.

01:19:50.132 --> 01:19:52.623
Okay, you're thinking with your dick.

01:19:52.801 --> 01:19:56.828
How many times l gotta tell you?
Stop thinking with your dick, all right?

01:19:58.073 --> 01:20:00.337
l am not thinking with my dick.

01:20:00.509 --> 01:20:03.876
Listen, even if l do get laid tonight,
then it doesn't change a thing.

01:20:04.046 --> 01:20:08.380
l'm still bringing her ass to jail, okay?
So just chill out.

01:20:17.226 --> 01:20:18.693
Hey.

01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:20.953
Hey.

01:20:28.737 --> 01:20:30.034
ls everything okay?

01:20:31.173 --> 01:20:33.038
Why wouldn't it be?

01:20:36.778 --> 01:20:38.109
They brought champagne.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.113
-l thought maybe you and l--
-Well, you thought wrong.

01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:44.211
What are you doing?

01:20:45.521 --> 01:20:47.489
l'm going to bed.
What does it look like?

01:20:49.992 --> 01:20:52.586
A great big blast from the past,
that's what.

01:20:52.761 --> 01:20:57.926
Oh, Nic shuts down again.
Oh, boy, does this take me back.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.124
Goddamn it.

01:21:08.644 --> 01:21:11.442
lf it's so familiar, you know
you're sleeping on the couch.

01:21:11.613 --> 01:21:13.478
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:21:13.649 --> 01:21:15.446
The hell l am.

01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:38.731
Are you gonna swallow that
any time soon?

01:21:38.907 --> 01:21:42.343
-Tastes great.
-Oh, God, you are so-- That's it.

01:21:44.279 --> 01:21:46.144
That is it.

01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:56.815
Are you happy now?

01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:01.122
Overjoyed.

01:22:13.842 --> 01:22:15.537
Oh, sorry, did l wake you?

01:22:15.711 --> 01:22:17.338
l just wanna say thank you...

01:22:17.512 --> 01:22:20.675
-...for a really lovely, lovely evening.
-No, Nic.

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:25.886
-What? No, Nic. Wait.
-Tickles, huh?

01:22:26.388 --> 01:22:28.219
Hey, come back here.

01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:30.620
Nic. l swear to God.

01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:32.485
Shit.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.031
Shit.

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:48.670
Hey. No. Wait. Nic.
Nic, get back here.

01:22:48.844 --> 01:22:50.971
Don't you dare, you--

01:22:53.548 --> 01:22:54.606
Shit.

01:22:57.219 --> 01:23:00.052
-What are you doing?
-l forgot my wallet.

01:23:03.392 --> 01:23:04.416
That's lrene's money.

01:23:05.327 --> 01:23:07.557
-lt's $ 1 0.
-lt's lrene's money.

01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:10.220
-l will pay it back.
-lrene will kill you.

01:23:10.932 --> 01:23:12.365
lrene will have me kill you.

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:21.031
Dwight! Dwight!

01:23:21.209 --> 01:23:23.609
-Yeah.
-lt's Milo's car.

01:23:23.779 --> 01:23:25.007
No, l--

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:28.707
Listen, here is a list of the other
bed and breakfasts in the area...

01:23:28.884 --> 01:23:30.613
...for your next visit.

01:23:30.786 --> 01:23:32.344
-Come on, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:33.782
Thank you.

01:23:35.357 --> 01:23:36.881
l'm sorry.

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:46.694
-Park that for you, sir?
-Don't scratch it.

01:23:46.868 --> 01:23:48.165
Roger that.

01:23:58.313 --> 01:24:00.304
Shoot. Okay.

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:11.957
Excuse me.

01:24:13.328 --> 01:24:14.989
Pilates World is across the street.

01:24:17.132 --> 01:24:18.156
Well, no.

01:24:18.333 --> 01:24:22.292
Actually, l want a tattoo.

01:24:22.471 --> 01:24:25.338
Let me guess. A cute little butterfly
on your shoulder?

01:24:26.975 --> 01:24:29.637
-Well--
-We're by appointment only.

01:24:30.746 --> 01:24:31.804
Darla...

01:24:32.481 --> 01:24:33.709
...go get me some beers.

01:24:35.817 --> 01:24:37.284
What do you want?

01:24:39.788 --> 01:24:41.221
l want a panther...

01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:45.688
...down the length of my body.

01:24:45.861 --> 01:24:49.262
l'd like the paws
to be about right here.

01:24:49.431 --> 01:24:53.367
Then l was thinking the mouth,
the teeth...

01:24:53.535 --> 01:24:54.763
...about right here.

01:24:54.936 --> 01:24:58.997
And then the tail....

01:25:00.842 --> 01:25:03.242
l'll let you figure that out.

01:25:04.146 --> 01:25:05.545
Cancel my appointments.

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:10.244
Darla.

01:25:13.188 --> 01:25:15.156
l'm Bone.

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:17.122
Bone?

01:25:17.292 --> 01:25:19.453
ls that short for something?

01:25:20.328 --> 01:25:21.522
Boner.

01:25:22.063 --> 01:25:23.223
Boner.

01:25:23.398 --> 01:25:25.958
Boner. That's catchy.

01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:29.861
-ls Earl here?
-Haven't seen him.

01:25:30.906 --> 01:25:32.464
Now...

01:25:33.375 --> 01:25:35.673
...pull up your shirt.

01:25:37.579 --> 01:25:39.547
Give me a look at the canvas.

01:25:40.816 --> 01:25:42.374
Yes.

01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:46.214
Yes, but do you mind, though,
if l hit the head first?

01:25:46.388 --> 01:25:47.514
Make it quick.

01:26:38.707 --> 01:26:40.265
Oh, my God.

01:26:41.643 --> 01:26:43.474
Bobby.

01:27:06.001 --> 01:27:07.468
Jimmy. Oh, my God.

01:27:09.504 --> 01:27:12.098
-Earl. What happened?
-Give me the keys to your pickup.

01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:13.866
l need to get some junk
out of my office.

01:27:14.509 --> 01:27:17.239
-Okay.
-Okay. Come on.

01:27:18.146 --> 01:27:20.774
-Wait.
-Oh, and a Walter Lilly called.

01:27:20.949 --> 01:27:22.280
He didn't leave a number.

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.145
Come here, this way.

01:27:36.765 --> 01:27:38.289
Son of a bitch.

01:27:38.466 --> 01:27:40.297
-The guy's a cop.
-l know.

01:27:40.468 --> 01:27:42.197
-And a drug dealer.
-l know.

01:27:42.404 --> 01:27:45.498
-lsn't that against the law?
-Yeah, last l checked.

01:27:48.443 --> 01:27:51.276
lt's Earl. Call me back
as soon as you get this, all right?

01:27:51.446 --> 01:27:52.640
l heard him on the phone.

01:27:52.814 --> 01:27:55.510
He was arranging some meeting
with a guy named Bobby.

01:27:56.451 --> 01:27:57.679
Bobby?

01:27:58.453 --> 01:27:59.784
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

01:27:59.955 --> 01:28:01.047
l got a better question.

01:28:01.222 --> 01:28:02.553
Where the hell is Milo?

01:28:03.124 --> 01:28:07.060
-l'm having the worst weekend.
-Who is this person?

01:28:07.228 --> 01:28:10.527
-How would l know that?
-Nobody. Nobody. l'm nobody.

01:28:10.699 --> 01:28:14.226
Well, that's wonderful. Now, is
Nobody gonna get out of this car?

01:28:14.436 --> 01:28:17.803
Or are we gonna put a big hole
in Nobody's head?

01:28:19.641 --> 01:28:21.040
Run.

01:28:22.344 --> 01:28:24.335
-No. Jimmy.
-l can't.

01:28:29.551 --> 01:28:34.181
Your hair shimmers
like sunlight on the ocean.

01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:02.076
<i>-You are such a jerk.
-You know what you are?</i>

01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.275
You're an emotional cripple,
that's what.

01:29:04.486 --> 01:29:07.114
You'd rather hunt down a guy
who's trying to kill you...

01:29:07.288 --> 01:29:10.121
...than deal with the guy
who vowed to put up with your shit...

01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:12.521
-...for the rest of his life.
-You know what?

01:29:12.694 --> 01:29:15.527
An $ 1 1 ,000 gambling debt.
Call that getting a handle on it?

01:29:17.098 --> 01:29:18.759
<i>-Not what l told you to say.
-Sorry.</i>

01:29:18.933 --> 01:29:22.198
-Hello. We have your girlfriend.
-l'm not his girlfriend.

01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:23.632
No, she is my girlfriend.

01:29:23.805 --> 01:29:28.105
But l'll tell you what,
why don't you keep her. Call it square.

01:29:29.944 --> 01:29:31.639
-He hung up.
-What?

01:29:39.554 --> 01:29:41.385
Holy shit.

01:29:41.556 --> 01:29:43.456
What the--?

01:29:50.031 --> 01:29:52.591
Let me guess,
she's driven you nuts already.

01:29:52.767 --> 01:29:56.828
-Damn it, Milo, they are not kidding.
-l wish l could help you. l really do.

01:29:57.038 --> 01:29:59.632
There's just one small problem.

01:30:00.775 --> 01:30:02.970
You handcuffed me
to Cupid, remember?

01:30:03.144 --> 01:30:06.272
How was l to know that a couple
of Neanderthals wanted you dead?

01:30:06.448 --> 01:30:09.440
-Whoa, not a couple.
-Why would you think we're a couple?

01:30:09.617 --> 01:30:11.778
You know what?
Put Chubby on the phone.

01:30:13.154 --> 01:30:15.418
-Hello?
-Really, Dwight?

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:17.683
Since when do bookies
kidnap people?

01:30:17.859 --> 01:30:21.522
lt's a little outside of my jurisdiction,
but we're under new management.

01:30:21.696 --> 01:30:24.597
Tell your partner he's got
about five seconds to release her...

01:30:24.766 --> 01:30:26.495
...or l'm gonna ruin his life.

01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:29.629
He says release her or else.
l'm paraphrasing.

01:30:29.804 --> 01:30:31.135
Bring it on.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.707
-Did you hear that?
-You know what? Put Nic on the phone.

01:30:36.945 --> 01:30:39.607
-What?
-Tell your pals l'll be there in 20.

01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:43.512
-He said he'll be here in 20 minutes.
-That's good. That's good.

01:30:43.685 --> 01:30:47.280
-Wait, Milo, l--
-Stop shifting in your seat.

01:30:47.455 --> 01:30:48.945
Tell them you have to
use the bathroom.

01:30:49.124 --> 01:30:50.989
Don't look around. Just do it.

01:30:55.196 --> 01:30:57.664
Okay, if he's not here
in 20 minutes--

01:30:57.832 --> 01:30:59.026
l need to pee.

01:31:00.535 --> 01:31:01.729
You need--?

01:31:02.504 --> 01:31:03.869
-Let's go pee.
-Okay.

01:31:04.038 --> 01:31:05.198
Yeah?

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:17.347
Oh, God.

01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:23.714
Yep.

01:31:24.225 --> 01:31:27.592
-Oh, please tell me you have a plan.
-Stay put until l come get you.

01:31:27.762 --> 01:31:30.026
-Wait a minute.
-What?

01:31:30.198 --> 01:31:32.758
She said he'd be here
in 20 minutes.

01:31:32.934 --> 01:31:35.027
-So?
-So...

01:31:35.203 --> 01:31:37.933
...she never told him where she was.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.507
Here, folks. Some money.
There you go. Yeah.

01:31:43.077 --> 01:31:47.514
-Ho, ho, ho, ladies. Happy Fourth.
-Oh, shit. That is Milo Boyd.

01:31:47.682 --> 01:31:49.616
Grab some of this, girls.

01:31:49.784 --> 01:31:51.012
-Holy shit.
-What?

01:31:51.186 --> 01:31:54.349
-Everybody have a good time.
-That's lrene's money.

01:31:54.522 --> 01:31:56.956
Step over here.
Come on, come on.

01:31:58.693 --> 01:32:00.718
Yes, here we go.

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:04.089
Plenty for everybody.

01:32:06.034 --> 01:32:07.968
Ladies, ladies. Here you go, ladies.

01:32:08.169 --> 01:32:09.193
That's my money.

01:32:09.737 --> 01:32:12.729
Get your hands off my dough!

01:32:15.777 --> 01:32:18.109
Time to go. You all right?
Car keys in the bag?

01:32:18.279 --> 01:32:20.110
-Yeah.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

01:32:24.919 --> 01:32:26.944
Why can't you be this guy
all the time?

01:32:27.121 --> 01:32:29.316
l am this guy all the time.

01:32:29.557 --> 01:32:33.823
No. A hotshot detective
that l fell so madly in love with.

01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:37.996
lnstead, this bounty hunter who's
always bragging about getting laid.

01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:41.095
Oh, wait.

01:32:41.636 --> 01:32:45.003
ls that what you're pissed about?
l was talking to Sid.

01:32:45.206 --> 01:32:48.471
What am l supposed to say,
that l'm sweet on my girl again?

01:32:49.143 --> 01:32:50.405
Yeah.

01:32:50.578 --> 01:32:53.979
Yes, you say it.
lf that's what you mean, you say it.

01:32:54.148 --> 01:32:55.911
You were honest
about your feelings?

01:32:56.818 --> 01:33:01.482
All l'm saying is this night could've
gone a lot differently if you had.

01:33:02.357 --> 01:33:04.757
Yeah. Just like our marriage.

01:33:07.128 --> 01:33:08.527
Maybe.

01:33:10.431 --> 01:33:13.958
Some detective l turned out to be.
Can't even figure you out.

01:33:17.338 --> 01:33:19.738
She's strong for a stripper.

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:24.373
Watch it, Ray.

01:33:26.981 --> 01:33:28.846
That was very painful.

01:33:30.518 --> 01:33:34.318
-l'm gonna kick your Amazo--
-Shut up, you little pussy.

01:33:37.692 --> 01:33:40.991
-Twenty Seventh squad, Griswald.
-Hey, Kenny, it's Milo.

01:33:41.195 --> 01:33:44.062
Hey, Mr. Boyd. What's up?

01:33:44.265 --> 01:33:48.167
l'm looking for Bobby. l called his cell,
but he's not picking up. ls he there?

01:33:48.336 --> 01:33:51.032
With you not being on the force
anymore and everything...

01:33:51.205 --> 01:33:54.697
-...l'm not really supposed to--
-Hey, Kenny, l don't have a lot of time.

01:33:54.876 --> 01:33:58.869
Now, you used to follow me around,
kiss my ass. You still into that?

01:33:59.047 --> 01:34:00.173
Yes, sir.

01:34:00.348 --> 01:34:04.011
-Well, pucker up. Where's Bobby?
-On his way to the depository.

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.920
Why? lt's the middle of the night.

01:34:08.089 --> 01:34:11.252
Lieutenant's got us working double
to complete the move.

01:34:11.426 --> 01:34:13.189
<i>-What move?
-To the new facility.</i>

01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:16.159
l heard they had to inventory
something like 1 94,000...

01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:19.892
-...pieces of evidence.
-Thank you. Take it easy.

01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:24.331
That must have been quite an audit.

01:34:25.573 --> 01:34:29.009
Do you know what happens to evidence
when the case doesn't go to trial?

01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:32.445
-What?
-Not a damn thing.

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.910
So it just sits there?

01:34:36.584 --> 01:34:37.676
Forever?

01:34:37.852 --> 01:34:39.843
Ripe for the picking.

01:34:56.404 --> 01:34:57.428
l'm hungry.

01:34:57.939 --> 01:34:59.600
l'll wait here for Bobby.

01:34:59.774 --> 01:35:04.268
Take the car. There's a pizza parlor
on Yonkers. Anything but peppers.

01:35:04.445 --> 01:35:06.640
There is no way
you're getting rid of me.

01:35:06.848 --> 01:35:09.282
l wouldn't let you drive
my car, anyway.

01:35:10.485 --> 01:35:11.782
That was an accident.

01:35:13.654 --> 01:35:15.986
-What?
-The whole N.Y.P.D. thing.

01:35:16.157 --> 01:35:18.990
Reason l got arrested.
You can make all the jokes you want.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.220
-But l'm an excellent driver.
-Wait.

01:35:22.563 --> 01:35:24.963
Your rap sheet
said you assaulted an officer.

01:35:25.133 --> 01:35:27.795
What--? Are you saying
you ran over a cop?

01:35:27.969 --> 01:35:30.733
l didn't run over anything.

01:35:32.173 --> 01:35:34.164
-Then what did you do?
-Nothing.

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.570
l was late for a press conference.

01:35:36.744 --> 01:35:37.938
Traffic was stopped...

01:35:38.112 --> 01:35:41.240
...so l thought l could squeeze by...

01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:43.145
...and l grazed it.

01:35:43.918 --> 01:35:45.078
You grazed a cop.

01:35:45.653 --> 01:35:47.416
No, l grazed a horse.

01:35:48.122 --> 01:35:52.286
Okay? Are you happy?
A big, dumb, old police horse...

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:54.360
...whose big, dumb, old police ass...

01:35:54.529 --> 01:35:58.295
...swayed in front of my car
as l was trying to pass it.

01:35:58.466 --> 01:36:00.457
-You hit a horse?
-l tapped him.

01:36:01.803 --> 01:36:06.103
Tapped him. There was one little,
little tuft of hair on my bumper.

01:36:06.274 --> 01:36:09.300
lt was-- Seriously. l can go to jail.

01:36:09.477 --> 01:36:13.504
-Yeah, for like...years.
-You're just-- You know--

01:36:13.681 --> 01:36:15.342
You're the world's worst driver.

01:36:15.516 --> 01:36:18.041
Will you just be quiet?

01:36:25.726 --> 01:36:29.184
Now, listen. We don't know
anything for sure, all right?

01:36:29.363 --> 01:36:33.959
-Maybe it's not what it looks like.
-lt's almost always what it looks like.

01:36:40.341 --> 01:36:43.071
Hey, Bobby.
Been looking all over for you.

01:36:43.244 --> 01:36:45.804
-You get my message?
-About the missing drugs? Yeah.

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.641
We got a problem. You know that?

01:36:49.984 --> 01:36:51.385
Yeah, yeah, we do.

01:36:56.524 --> 01:36:59.152
-Can l help you?
-We're here to see Bobby Jenkins.

01:36:59.327 --> 01:37:00.988
Can l tell him what it's regarding?

01:37:01.696 --> 01:37:04.028
-Put the bag down, Earl.
-What, this?

01:37:04.832 --> 01:37:07.232
-What's wrong with you?
-Don't make this harder...

01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:09.392
-...than it has to be.
-The bag's down.

01:37:10.738 --> 01:37:11.864
You know, l gotta--

01:37:14.742 --> 01:37:16.334
Buzz me in. Now.

01:37:20.681 --> 01:37:22.205
Got it.

01:37:36.397 --> 01:37:37.887
Sorry.

01:37:57.118 --> 01:37:59.086
Jesus.

01:37:59.387 --> 01:38:00.945
-What?
-There's blood.

01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:11.095
Oh, my God.

01:38:11.532 --> 01:38:13.727
-Bobby.
-You okay, partner?

01:38:13.901 --> 01:38:16.802
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Looking for some answers.

01:38:16.971 --> 01:38:19.496
-Who shot you?
-Earl Mahler.

01:38:19.674 --> 01:38:22.472
Yeah, l've been tracking him
for the last couple of weeks.

01:38:23.544 --> 01:38:26.104
After he murdered Walter.
Walter Lilly.

01:38:28.282 --> 01:38:29.579
Yeah, he's got my gun.

01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:30.842
-What--?
-Stay with him.

01:38:31.052 --> 01:38:32.178
Where are you going?

01:38:32.353 --> 01:38:34.116
-Stay with him.
-Where are you going?

01:38:34.288 --> 01:38:36.153
Baby, l'll be back. All right.

01:38:41.462 --> 01:38:44.693
Hey, he's gonna be all right.
He's a good cop.

01:38:45.366 --> 01:38:47.960
You're a good cop.
Look what happened to you.

01:38:49.704 --> 01:38:51.934
Oh, yeah. You got a point.

01:39:05.686 --> 01:39:07.210
Hey. Hey, where you going?

01:39:33.381 --> 01:39:34.405
Drop it.

01:39:38.419 --> 01:39:40.216
You were easy.

01:39:41.822 --> 01:39:43.187
Oh, God.

01:39:45.259 --> 01:39:48.160
You already shot one cop.
Shooting another one's...

01:39:48.329 --> 01:39:52.163
-...not gonna help things with the jury.
-You're not a cop.

01:39:52.733 --> 01:39:55.725
-Well, that's just hurtful.
-Get down on your knees.

01:39:56.437 --> 01:39:59.565
My knees, they're not so great,
you know. Took a jump off a roof.

01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:02.766
The last thing l care about
is your knees, your health.

01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:06.073
Now get down on your knees.

01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:11.541
Now what?

01:40:11.719 --> 01:40:13.380
Should have minded
your own business.

01:40:14.388 --> 01:40:19.223
-Not concerned about your future?
-lt's time for you to go, asshole.

01:40:20.461 --> 01:40:23.555
Drop it. And l'm the only one
who gets to call him ''asshole.''

01:40:26.534 --> 01:40:27.865
You better tell your girl--

01:40:31.238 --> 01:40:32.865
That's for calling me a girl.

01:40:35.710 --> 01:40:39.578
That's for shooting at my wife.

01:40:50.224 --> 01:40:54.752
So Earl Mahler was using Walter Lilly
to gain access to the narcotics cage.

01:40:54.929 --> 01:40:58.763
That's right. He was gonna come clean,
but by the time l got to his apartment...

01:40:58.933 --> 01:41:00.059
...he was already dead.

01:41:00.234 --> 01:41:02.498
-But there was no proof it was Mahler.
-Right.

01:41:02.703 --> 01:41:06.639
lf it wasn't for that parking ticket,
he might have gotten away with it.

01:41:06.807 --> 01:41:09.139
That's because
she's a hell of a reporter.

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.334
Thank you.

01:41:11.145 --> 01:41:13.113
But you did get one thing wrong.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.339
Oh, are you kidding? Come on.

01:41:15.516 --> 01:41:17.108
l'm just saying.

01:41:17.618 --> 01:41:21.281
Bobby, it looked really bad.
lt really did.

01:41:21.455 --> 01:41:23.753
l mean, your name
was on the suicide report.

01:41:23.924 --> 01:41:26.950
-The bowling alley photo.
-l walked you down the goddamn aisle.

01:41:27.128 --> 01:41:29.460
-That's what l said.
-Great. That's what he said.

01:41:29.630 --> 01:41:32.292
Wait. You serious?
She really thought l was involved?

01:41:32.466 --> 01:41:34.934
Yeah. But then, you know,
she never liked you.

01:41:35.102 --> 01:41:37.536
You know what?
Never liked your ass, either.

01:41:40.508 --> 01:41:42.601
l gotta get this story in.

01:41:47.748 --> 01:41:52.481
-Hello?
-l just want you to know that it is over.

01:41:52.653 --> 01:41:54.621
You and me, we are through.

01:41:55.289 --> 01:41:56.881
Stewart, are you drunk?

01:41:57.057 --> 01:42:00.618
No, that is the aftereffects
of horse tranquilizers...

01:42:00.795 --> 01:42:03.662
...that were injected
into my now-broken leg...

01:42:03.831 --> 01:42:07.665
...by a local veterinarian, Nicole.

01:42:07.835 --> 01:42:11.828
<i>Oh, we had something beautiful
and special and rare...</i>

01:42:12.006 --> 01:42:16.375
...but if these are the kinds of people
you hang out with, you can forget it.

01:42:16.544 --> 01:42:18.341
lf that's the way you really feel....

01:42:18.512 --> 01:42:21.072
Wait, no, no, no. Wait, no, hold on.
No, no, no, stop.

01:42:21.282 --> 01:42:25.810
Are you admitting that we had
something beautiful, special and rare?

01:42:25.986 --> 01:42:27.544
Stewart, l gotta go, okay?

01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:31.384
Okay, you go. But just know
you have given my heart wings.

01:42:31.559 --> 01:42:34.687
For moments ago,
l was barely able to walk...

01:42:34.862 --> 01:42:39.094
...but now, now l will run to your side
with the--

01:42:39.934 --> 01:42:42.528
<i>-Goddamn!
-Stewart?</i>

01:42:42.703 --> 01:42:44.568
Hello?

01:42:47.942 --> 01:42:51.105
-Do you know what l really wanna do?
-What?

01:42:51.312 --> 01:42:54.543
l wanna blow off this story,
and l wanna take you home.

01:42:57.551 --> 01:42:59.451
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:01.247
Yeah.

01:43:01.422 --> 01:43:06.086
But l gotta get this story in before
anybody gets wind of it. l just have to.

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:09.195
-You understand that, right?
-Oh, totally. Don't--

01:43:09.363 --> 01:43:10.523
-Listen, l get it.
-Yeah?

01:43:10.698 --> 01:43:12.461
l get it. You're just doing your job.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.300
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:43:15.469 --> 01:43:16.766
Thank you.

01:43:16.937 --> 01:43:18.768
That's not gonna be
an issue this time.

01:43:18.939 --> 01:43:23.035
We both will sometimes
have to put our job first.

01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:25.269
lt's like that, right?

01:43:25.446 --> 01:43:27.038
Yeah.

01:43:27.381 --> 01:43:30.282
Yep. But after....

01:43:35.489 --> 01:43:37.081
We're actually doing this.

01:43:37.591 --> 01:43:39.058
Yes, we are.

01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:47.793
Why are we pulling over here?

01:43:50.671 --> 01:43:51.933
Here?

01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:56.136
No.

01:43:56.644 --> 01:43:58.236
You wouldn't.

01:43:59.246 --> 01:44:01.305
l told you l was bringing you in.

01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:05.009
And we have, oh,
five minutes to spare.

01:44:05.786 --> 01:44:08.186
Now, don't be mad, babe...

01:44:08.389 --> 01:44:11.290
...because we're never gonna get this
marriage going again...

01:44:11.458 --> 01:44:13.926
...if you come into it
with anger and resentment.

01:44:14.094 --> 01:44:16.289
l would like to be
taken into custody, please.

01:44:16.997 --> 01:44:18.589
Officer?

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.967
Let's go.

01:44:34.181 --> 01:44:37.708
This is ridiculous. Unbelievable.

01:44:38.619 --> 01:44:40.348
Where did you--?

01:44:41.422 --> 01:44:43.652
Aren't l entitled to a phone call?

01:44:53.033 --> 01:44:55.001
lt's the bounty hunter.

01:44:55.169 --> 01:44:59.538
How was your weekend, asshole?
Did you set any more parades on fire?

01:45:01.875 --> 01:45:05.140
Actually, Gelman, the rest
of my weekend was pretty quiet.

01:45:05.312 --> 01:45:07.940
-Yeah?
-Until now.

01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:12.081
lt'll go to the lnternet edition...

01:45:12.252 --> 01:45:16.484
...and then all media outlets will have
to come through us directly for details.

01:45:16.657 --> 01:45:19.148
Great. Thanks.

01:45:20.661 --> 01:45:25.098
Using your one call
to phone in a story. That is so you.

01:45:25.265 --> 01:45:26.596
What are you doing here?

01:45:26.767 --> 01:45:28.359
lt's a special night, remember?

01:45:28.969 --> 01:45:30.732
No way we're not
spending it together.

01:45:30.904 --> 01:45:33.202
Hey, can we go
in the same cell together?

01:45:33.374 --> 01:45:34.602
Get in the cell, dickhead.

01:45:34.775 --> 01:45:36.766
-Let's go.
-l'm going.

01:45:45.753 --> 01:45:47.220
You're crazy.

01:45:47.921 --> 01:45:49.013
Maybe l am.

01:45:51.392 --> 01:45:52.552
Come here.

01:46:08.776 --> 01:46:10.641
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

01:46:11.612 --> 01:46:14.445
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
