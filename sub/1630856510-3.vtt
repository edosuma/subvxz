00:00.280 --> 00:03.520
(tense music)

00:03.520 --> 00:07.680
A bomb delivered by a
drone destroyed a transformer

00:07.680 --> 00:09.480
at the Isle of Dogs Power Station.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.960
The person we believe
to be the drone pilot

00:10.960 --> 00:12.280
is now in custody.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.680
Take one more step and I'll shoot!

00:14.680 --> 00:16.440
[Thom] His name is Nicholas Hood.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.040
You found out that Johansson
was having an affair.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.280
You rigged his lover to a collar bomb.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.440
(bomb beeping)

00:22.440 --> 00:24.000
Sorry, just stay still for me, please.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.360
(victim screaming)

00:25.360 --> 00:26.160
(bomb blasts)

00:26.160 --> 00:27.600
Lana!

00:27.600 --> 00:29.400
Nick, you messed this one up.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.680
I don't recognise your laws.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.640
[Lana] Everything all right with Mum?

00:32.640 --> 00:33.920
[Lana's Dad] She won't talk.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.040
People deal with grief differently, Dad.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.320
Well, maybe you could help.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.760
I'm all in.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.160
Tell me what you want me to do.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.000
We will.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.440
(tense music)

00:42.440 --> 00:43.280
[Man] What's that?

00:43.280 --> 00:44.680
[Woman] Insurance.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.920
I love you and I would
love to make it work.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.200
Yeah, me too.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.320
The ITN Switchboard got
a call 25 minutes ago

00:52.320 --> 00:54.200
saying there was a device
inside one the lifts.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.000
Expo-2, we've got a jammer.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.080
All clear.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.120
(bomb blasts)

01:00.120 --> 01:01.080
(tense music)

01:01.080 --> 01:02.200
Explosion in one of the lift shafts.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.360
Where's the nearest access point?

01:03.360 --> 01:04.680
[Woman] Up here.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.680
(suspenseful music)

01:06.680 --> 01:07.880
What?

01:07.880 --> 01:09.600
(Thom screams)

01:09.600 --> 01:11.120
(body thuds)

01:11.120 --> 01:13.720
(tense music)

01:16.880 --> 01:18.640
(Lana shudders)

01:18.640 --> 01:21.480
(dramatic music)

01:28.280 --> 01:30.880
(sombre music)

02:28.880 --> 02:31.120
Who's the officer killed?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.480
Well...

02:34.480 --> 02:37.120
When will you release the name?

02:38.640 --> 02:41.240
(sombre music)

02:55.760 --> 02:58.080
(vehicle door slams)

02:58.080 --> 03:00.640
(tense music)

03:02.000 --> 03:06.880
Can you give me any more
information about the suspect?

03:06.880 --> 03:09.400
Any other persons of interest?

03:09.400 --> 03:12.000
(tense music)

03:15.000 --> 03:17.640
Look, anything at all I can use.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.920
[Man] Martina.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.200
I'll call you back.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.800
(tense music)

03:29.800 --> 03:32.560
(dramatic music)

03:35.480 --> 03:38.160
In the light of last night's events,

03:38.160 --> 03:41.120
I'm now taking direct charge
of this investigation.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.000
Thom was an outstanding officer,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.160
dedicated, hardworking, liked by all.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.840
The best thing we can do,

03:50.840 --> 03:54.480
the only thing we can
do to honour his memory

03:54.480 --> 03:57.360
is to catch whoever did this.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.640
They're still out there.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.160
They've taken one of our own.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.960
This is personal now.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.600
It's our fight and we will win.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.520
(jazzy music)

04:18.440 --> 04:19.560
Erm, plate's hot.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.640
Oh, thanks.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.400
(door thuds shut)

04:29.400 --> 04:30.840
Can I get a black coffee please?

04:30.840 --> 04:31.680
[Barista] Yeah, sure.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.760
Thank you.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.360
(jazzy music)

04:41.200 --> 04:43.200
That looks good.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.080
What is it?

04:46.080 --> 04:48.760
Um, er, Chilaquiles?

04:48.760 --> 04:52.320
Er, it's basically, erm,
corn tortilla pieces fried,

04:52.320 --> 04:55.320
salsa, cheese, eggs, and beans.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.080
I come here every morning,

04:57.080 --> 04:58.720
have exactly the same thing, it's...

04:58.720 --> 04:59.560
It's delicious.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.160
Well, it looks it.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.720
Try a bit.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.800
Oh.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.640
No, I can't.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.200
Go on, go on.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.040
It's the perfect start to the day.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.080
All right. (laughs)

05:11.080 --> 05:12.520
So what, do I just get...

05:12.520 --> 05:13.720
Proper bit with cheese.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.520
Get some of the beans, too.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.600
[Woman] Okay.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.560
[Man] Hm?

05:19.560 --> 05:20.400
[Woman] Mm!

05:20.400 --> 05:22.560
[Man] What do you think?

05:22.560 --> 05:24.640
That's amazing.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.280
(knocking on van)

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
(van door bangs shut)

05:36.240 --> 05:39.600
The working assumption is
that these attacks are linked,

05:39.600 --> 05:43.880
though the targets appear
to be radically different.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.840
Last night's explosion took
place in the data server room

05:46.840 --> 05:48.880
of Tratea Global Analytics.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.440
It's a data mining company.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.520
It's been accused of obtaining

05:52.520 --> 05:55.520
and using personal data illegally.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.880
Now, let's get some answers.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.040
What kind of data do they hold?

05:59.040 --> 06:02.320
Why would terrorists target
this particular company?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.200
Is there a connection
with the power station?

06:04.200 --> 06:06.440
And Thom, how did he fall?

06:07.320 --> 06:10.000
What were his movements
just before his death?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.960
He was on the stairs, sir.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.880
He was taking passengers from
the lift to the ground floor

06:13.880 --> 06:15.600
when the bomb went off.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.360
He must have gone back up.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.040
Any CCTV?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.200
Erm, the team are
processing that now, sir.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.800
We should have collected
all pertinent materials

06:22.800 --> 06:23.960
within the hour.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.360
But, erm, this is what we've got so far.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.080
(woman laughing)

06:33.080 --> 06:34.560
Yeah.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.440
So, thought I'd do the same here.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.920
[Woman] A man of habits.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.000
[Man] Right, I'd better go.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.840
I'll be late for work.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.560
[Woman] Oh, that's a shame, I was, erm,

06:41.560 --> 06:44.600
well, I was enjoying our chat. (chuckles)

06:44.600 --> 06:48.080
Well, we could, erm,
continue another time,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.160
if you'd like.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.960
Yeah.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.120
Yeah, maybe.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.200
Tonight?

06:58.320 --> 06:59.920
Mm.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.320
Look, Why don't you,
er, give me your number?

07:03.320 --> 07:05.400
I lost my phone.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.000
I'll email you.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.880
Give me your address.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.960
Right.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.440
[Woman] Oliver.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.520
And you are?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Hope.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.400
I didn't realise you were
so important, Oliver.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.480
[Oliver] Ah, tell my boss that.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.600
(Hope laughs)

07:29.600 --> 07:31.200
Don't forget your bag.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.320
Oh, yeah.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.000
Er, thanks.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.080
Erm, see you later.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.640
Looking forward to it.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.160
(shop bell tinkles)

07:54.040 --> 07:56.640
(sombre music)

08:15.800 --> 08:16.560
[Coworker] Morning.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.640
Morning.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.200
(telephone ringing nearby)

08:24.200 --> 08:26.800
(tense music)

08:28.520 --> 08:31.160
(paper tearing)

08:39.520 --> 08:42.000
(tense music)

08:46.640 --> 08:49.920
(staff chattering)

08:49.920 --> 08:50.760
Helen.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.840
Yeah?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.680
Just can't believe it.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.640
You two were perfect together.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.480
(Helen sniffles)

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
You okay?

09:02.440 --> 09:04.120
Mm.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.520
Looking for those that've got jam inside.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.560
They're nice.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.120
(mobile ringing)

09:11.120 --> 09:13.560
Dad, I can't really talk right now.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.600
Yeah, I'm sorry to
bother you at work, luv.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.920
I was just wondering if you've
managed to speak to Mum.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.760
Yeah, well I called her.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.160
She just didn't call me back.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.840
Look, can you try her
again for me, please, luv?

09:22.840 --> 09:23.920
You know, when you've a minute.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.880
Okay, I'll text her.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.160
I'll tell her I'll come round tonight.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.400
[Lana's Dad] All right, thanks, luv.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.280
I've got to go.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.360
Re...

09:34.000 --> 09:37.560
So, I've just briefed
the Home Secretary.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.400
She's offering us whatever
resources we require.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.480
Money, additional manpower,
but we have to deliver.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.680
Batra, run us through
how the terrorists got

09:45.680 --> 09:46.760
a bomb into the building.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.000
(clears throat) Yeah.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.200
Er, a fault was reported on the lift.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.680
An engineer was called in,

09:52.680 --> 09:53.960
but his vehicle was stolen

09:53.960 --> 09:56.080
and he's since been reported missing.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.920
So the terrorists used his pass

09:57.920 --> 10:01.000
to gain access to both
the building and the lift.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.240
Er, according to the log,

10:02.240 --> 10:04.800
he left the building shortly
before the explosion and

10:04.800 --> 10:08.080
we're using ANPR to track the
movement of the stolen van.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.040
There was a call that came
in about 20 minutes ago.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.240
Er, the caller used
voice altering software

10:13.240 --> 10:16.000
and he claims to have vital
intelligence on the group.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.840
Prank call?

10:16.840 --> 10:17.680
I don't think so.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.600
He knew detailed information
about how the CCTV

10:19.600 --> 10:21.640
at the power station was hacked.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.040
He wants to meet.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.400
[John] Can we contact him?

10:24.400 --> 10:25.280
[Batra] He didn't give us his number,

10:25.280 --> 10:26.160
we couldn't trace the call,

10:26.160 --> 10:28.040
but he said he's gonna call us back.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.800
Okay, good.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.160
And what about Nick Hood?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.440
Well, he's wiped his life clean.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.720
There's nothing in his flat.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.240
No photos, there's nothing.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.120
Social media?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.440
He has none.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.640
But we're using facial
recognition to download pictures

10:41.640 --> 10:43.720
from other profiles.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.400
Er, graduation photos,
Hood and his colleagues

10:46.400 --> 10:48.680
at a symposium and that kind of thing.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.760
We're talking to the security services

10:50.760 --> 10:53.200
to see if anyone in the
photos are on a watch list.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.600
We did turn up one thing, sir.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.200
Immigration and travel manifests show

10:56.200 --> 10:58.680
that he flew to Poland a year ago.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.920
He played in the Krakow Chess Open

11:00.920 --> 11:02.680
and the tournament organisers confirmed

11:02.680 --> 11:04.320
that he played the first day

11:04.320 --> 11:06.880
and then he just didn't attend
for the rest of the week.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.000
And then UK Border Force say
that he then re-entered the UK

11:10.000 --> 11:12.440
through Dover like a week later.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.720
Our team has ascertained that the TNT

11:14.720 --> 11:16.280
was from Eastern Europe.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.360
TM 200.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.520
Right, speak with Interpol
and the Polish authorities.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.120
Let's find out everything
he did that week.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.960
Sir, erm, CCTV have
just sent this through.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.040
(tense music)

11:46.560 --> 11:49.160
(sombre music)

12:10.040 --> 12:11.320
(dramatic music)

12:11.320 --> 12:13.200
(bin crashes)

12:13.200 --> 12:14.040
[Thom] Tell you the truth.

12:14.040 --> 12:14.880
[Lana] I love you.

12:14.880 --> 12:15.800
[Thom] Did you mean it?

12:15.800 --> 12:19.080
(dramatic music)

12:19.080 --> 12:19.920
(knocking at door)

12:19.920 --> 12:20.760
[Hass] Boss.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.600
It's me.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.760
We've got a call.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.320
(tense music)

12:37.800 --> 12:41.080
Expo-8, I'm gonna use the x-ray.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.560
Why don't you use the disruptor?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.240
No, there might be forensic evidence.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.600
We don't want to damage it.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.160
(tense music)

13:12.320 --> 13:15.080
(device beeping)

13:27.080 --> 13:29.080
X-ray clear.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.240
(tense music)

13:37.160 --> 13:39.640
(can hissing)

13:41.560 --> 13:44.040
(tense music)

13:49.800 --> 13:51.040
I'd appreciate it

13:51.040 --> 13:54.080
if we could keep this
incident under wraps.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.600
We don't want to unduly alarm the public

13:55.600 --> 13:57.240
if we don't have to.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.840
Sorry, I can't do that.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.240
This is news.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.320
But they've sent it to you

14:01.320 --> 14:03.320
'cause they want to be in the news.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.280
This is a terror campaign
fought in the media.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.840
Streaming attacks,
messages posted, now this.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.320
It'll get out anyway.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.160
Look around.

14:10.160 --> 14:10.960
It's a newsroom.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.280
Someone will leak it.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.680
The public deserve to be fully informed.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.880
Well, then you're forcing my hand.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.080
I'll get a DSMA-Notice

14:18.080 --> 14:21.440
to stop you from making
this public knowledge.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.960
You and I both know those
aren't legally binding.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.800
(sirens blaring)

14:29.520 --> 14:32.280
(mobile ringing)

14:35.600 --> 14:37.000
(tense music)

14:37.000 --> 14:38.080
Tell me.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.680
So, CCTV from an underground carpark

14:40.680 --> 14:42.800
near to Tratea Global Analytics

14:42.800 --> 14:45.920
shows the fake lift engineer
getting out of a van.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.920
So we used ANPR to trace that van.

14:48.920 --> 14:49.760
It led us here.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.920
(doors banging open)

14:51.920 --> 14:54.360
Armed police!

14:54.360 --> 14:55.200
Clear!

14:55.200 --> 14:58.480
[Officer] Clear!

14:58.480 --> 15:01.080
(tense music)

15:02.920 --> 15:04.920
Trojan-1-7 to Expo-2.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.240
Possible IED.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.920
(tense music)

15:08.920 --> 15:09.960
Hi.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.040
I'm Lana, Bomb Squad.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.120
I'm here to help.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.160
Right.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.520
Just need you to keep really still,

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
with your finger on that trigger.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.320
[Victim] Yeah.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.160
That's all you need to do.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.000
Uh-huh.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay, I'm gonna take a look

15:24.000 --> 15:26.520
and get us out of here.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.440
You're doing great.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.360
Just stay really still, yeah?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.960
(tense music)

15:34.040 --> 15:35.200
That's it, you're doing brilliant.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.280
Right.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.120
(tense music)

15:38.120 --> 15:40.200
Okay.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.400
Okay.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.960
(tense music)

15:47.280 --> 15:50.800
(victim breathing deeply)

15:55.680 --> 15:57.240
Right, I'm gonna take this box out,

15:57.240 --> 15:59.400
so it might move the wire a little bit.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.480
There.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.400
That's it.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.760
(victim breathing deeply)

16:05.760 --> 16:07.240
Deep breaths.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.800
(tense music)

16:17.680 --> 16:18.840
You're good.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.280
You can let go.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.120
(victim exhales)

16:21.120 --> 16:22.520
Look.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.640
Look at me.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.440
Look at these wires.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.160
They're not connected.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.280
To anything.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.880
(victim breathing deeply)

16:31.920 --> 16:33.760
Expo-2 to all units, clear.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.840
Hoax device.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.840
All right, let me take
that out of your hand.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.240
I'll get the team to
come and check you out.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.320
(victim breathing rapidly)

16:45.320 --> 16:47.400
Ma'am.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.480
Anything interesting?

16:55.359 --> 16:56.920
[John] What is it counting down to?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.240
And who is he?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.960
Gerard Fisher, the real lift engineer.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.839
They grabbed him outside his house,

17:02.839 --> 17:05.640
stuck a bag on his head, and
took him to the workshop.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.280
Forensics have done a thorough
search of the premises.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.520
Wiped clean, no fingerprints.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.320
We found two things of interest.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.440
This tiny wire that does correspond

17:14.440 --> 17:16.320
with the kind that was
used on the collar bomb

17:16.320 --> 17:18.520
and at the carpark and the power station.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.080
They probably missed it
when they cleared up,

17:20.080 --> 17:22.960
so that would suggest a
bomb factory of sorts.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.680
Also, there was a lot of burnt material.

17:24.680 --> 17:25.600
We found this.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.440
[John] What is it?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.280
DI Batra?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.120
[Sonya] We're not sure, sir.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.240
Could be a diagram,
possibly a circuit board.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.440
Oh, a circuit board?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.240
The terrorists are using
very advanced circuitry,

17:33.240 --> 17:35.800
stuff we've never seen before.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.640
What...

17:36.640 --> 17:37.480
What's that?

17:37.480 --> 17:38.320
[Sonya] We're not sure yet.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.560
I've sent it to Porton Down.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.400
They're having a look.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.200
Sir!

17:41.200 --> 17:42.040
Patch it through.

17:42.040 --> 17:42.880
Er, we've got the caller back on the line.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.800
Put a trace on.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.160
Er, this is DI Batra.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.280
Who am I speaking to?

17:47.280 --> 17:50.400
[Caller] I want you to
know I haven't hurt anyone.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.640
And what can you give us?

17:52.640 --> 17:53.560
[Caller] Information.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.000
But not on the phone.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.440
I want to meet.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.880
Wargrave Square in an hour.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.560
One officer, someone who
knows about explosives.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.280
That'll be two officers,
a detective and an Expo.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.720
[Caller] No more than that.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.240
I don't want to see armed
police, snipers, any of it.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.880
If I do, the whole thing's off.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.800
Er, contact Helen.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.560
Tell her to meet Lana at the location.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.360
And I am not losing another
officer to these people.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.000
I want armed officers, snipers.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.400
[Helen] This morning,

18:27.400 --> 18:30.520
a digital timer was sent to a journalist.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.600
It's set to countdown to 7:00 PM.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.160
Why do you think that is?

18:36.160 --> 18:39.080
Well, we all lead busy lives.

18:39.080 --> 18:42.040
Sometimes you need a reminder.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.760
Of what?

18:43.760 --> 18:44.880
Another bomb?

18:44.880 --> 18:46.800
Oh, you're very one-track.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.680
Always bombs with you.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.680
Can't we talk about something else?

18:55.080 --> 18:59.160
This postcard was found with the timer.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.880
"Welcome to the Labyrinth."

19:01.880 --> 19:03.000
How cryptic.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.920
Mm.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.160
What does that mean to you?

19:06.160 --> 19:09.400
A Greek myth, labyrinth, Minotaur.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.880
Something deadly waiting
for you in the centre.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.200
Top of my head.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.120
Might just be me.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.760
Benefit of a good classical education.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.360
(Helen sighs)

19:20.360 --> 19:22.920
(clears throat) So it's
a kind of maze, then?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.960
A puzzle?

19:24.960 --> 19:27.600
Are you and your friends
playing a game with us, Nick?

19:27.600 --> 19:28.440
You're just a little bit smarter

19:28.440 --> 19:30.400
than the average man in the street?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.720
That's not for me to say.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.640
I bet you could beat me at chess.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.080
Well, I'm happy to give you a game.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.720
But bit of a quitter, right?

19:43.720 --> 19:44.800
I'm sorry?

19:44.800 --> 19:46.400
Krakow.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.240
The Chess Open.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.600
You went there, you played
the first day and then

19:49.600 --> 19:52.240
you didn't turn up the rest of the week.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.720
Worried you couldn't keep it up?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.120
I like a challenge.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.760
Procuring TM-200,
that kind of challenge?

20:01.800 --> 20:05.520
Last night a Met detective was murdered.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.680
He was pushed down a lift shaft.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.960
And we saw who did it.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.680
We saw their face on CCTV.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.600
We'll find them soon.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.080
We'll put the pressure on.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.920
And maybe they're just a little
bit smarter than you are.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.640
Maybe they'll sell you out.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.720
Cut a deal.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.600
Unless you want to get in there first,

20:26.640 --> 20:28.640
tell us what you know.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.400
You underestimate me, Officer.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.080
I still have one or
two moves up my sleeve.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.760
Sous les paves, la plage.`

20:41.720 --> 20:44.760
(tense music)

20:44.760 --> 20:46.920
Sous les paves, la plage!

20:52.680 --> 20:55.720
(papers rustling)

20:55.720 --> 20:58.640
(computer chimes)

21:04.640 --> 21:07.640
(keyboard clacking)

21:16.240 --> 21:19.080
(gentle music)

21:19.080 --> 21:21.680
(tense music)

21:43.080 --> 21:43.840
Thanks, Helen.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.920
Yeah.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.640
So what do you reckon?

21:53.640 --> 21:55.720
You think he'll show?

21:56.360 --> 21:58.360
I wouldn't.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.160
Did you get anything else from Hood?

22:03.160 --> 22:04.880
Not really.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.960
He likes to play games,
he thinks he's clever.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.080
Is he?

22:10.080 --> 22:12.160
Probably.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.520
I mean, he did seem a bit agitated.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.000
He lost his cool.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.920
You know, that's a first for him.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.000
Do you know why?

22:25.320 --> 22:27.160
Yeah.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.240
I, erm...

22:29.760 --> 22:31.760
I told him about Thom.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.640
That we'd seen the footage,
we'd seen who did it.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.240
And then he started speaking French.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.360
French?

22:42.360 --> 22:44.440
Yeah.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.040
"Sous les paves, la plage."

22:47.040 --> 22:48.840
I looked it up.

22:48.840 --> 22:53.840
Apparently it was a revolutionary
slogan from Paris, 1968.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.000
[Lana] What does it mean?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.600
Under the streets, the beach.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.160
What?

22:59.160 --> 23:01.520
I don't know, like...

23:01.520 --> 23:04.760
Underneath all the bullshit,
all the restrictions of life,

23:04.760 --> 23:07.600
there's freedom, you've
just got to grab it.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.440
(mobile ringing)

23:14.040 --> 23:15.720
Hello?

23:15.720 --> 23:18.800
[Caller] I told you to come alone.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.640
How did you get this number?

23:22.640 --> 23:25.920
[Caller] Helen Jane
Morgan, 11 Kendall Close.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.080
You're ВЈ117 overdrawn.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.520
Had your appendix
removed when you were 15.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.240
And failed GCSE maths twice.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.360
I can get anything I want on you.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.000
You think I'm blind?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.520
The whole area is swarming with police.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.040
There's a sniper on the roof.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.880
Yes, we have to take precautions.

23:41.880 --> 23:42.960
[Caller] You lied to me.

23:42.960 --> 23:43.800
(line beeps off)

23:43.800 --> 23:45.880
Hello?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.440
(tense music)

23:48.440 --> 23:49.280
Shit.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.560
(tense music)

23:50.560 --> 23:52.720
Yes, sir, no show.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.680
He spotted the plainclothes
officers, CTSFO.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.520
Yeah.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.280
We're heading back now.

23:58.280 --> 24:00.360
Okay.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.480
(Helen sighs)

24:03.480 --> 24:05.800
Are you doing all right?

24:05.800 --> 24:06.840
Yeah.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.920
Yeah, thanks.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.000
You okay?

24:11.000 --> 24:11.840
Yeah.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.400
Fine.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.440
I mean, 'cause you and Thom,

24:14.440 --> 24:16.880
I know that you guys
worked together a while.

24:16.880 --> 24:17.960
Yeah, we were.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.800
I mean it's--

24:18.800 --> 24:19.640
(mobile ringing)

24:19.640 --> 24:21.440
Oh, sorry.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.840
Hello?

24:22.840 --> 24:25.920
[Caller] Still want to meet?

24:25.920 --> 24:27.760
Where are you now?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.640
[Caller] Walk to the
junction, then cross over.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.440
- Right, come on.
- Okay.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.280
Listen, we're...

24:31.280 --> 24:32.680
(tense music)

24:32.680 --> 24:34.760
Okay.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.840
[Caller] Do not attempt
to communicate with anyone.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.840
Why don't we meet on the street?

24:39.840 --> 24:43.240
[Caller] There's a path to your right.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
Walk down the path.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.520
There's a ramp to your right.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.600
Walk up it.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.520
There's a door on your right.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.160
Open it and go down the steps.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.040
No, no, we can't meet inside a building.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.480
There are strict protocols.

25:03.480 --> 25:04.600
[Caller] 10 seconds.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.000
Up to you.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.240
(tense music)

25:09.240 --> 25:11.320
Five.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.760
Lana!

25:12.760 --> 25:14.520
Wait.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.600
(suspenseful music)

25:37.240 --> 25:40.160
(door creaks open)

25:43.160 --> 25:47.000
(door bangs shut)

25:48.760 --> 25:50.960
I am DS Morgan.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.040
This is Expo Washington.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.160
What's your name?

25:58.520 --> 26:00.720
Alex.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.560
Your real name?

26:01.560 --> 26:02.920
I don't have long.

26:02.920 --> 26:03.800
They're sending a car.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.600
Who are?

26:04.600 --> 26:05.560
It's what they do.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.720
Send a car, put a bag over my head.

26:07.720 --> 26:08.560
Okay, why would they do that--

26:08.560 --> 26:10.360
Don't trust me, obviously.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.200
I'm not one of them.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.000
I'm not part of it.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.480
I'm just a tech guy.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.560
So who are they?

26:16.280 --> 26:19.520
They call themselves The Wave.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.480
I've never seen their faces.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.120
So what do they want?

26:24.120 --> 26:27.120
They believe society's unjust.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.440
(scoffs) That's original.

26:29.440 --> 26:33.800
They're riding on the
current wave of discontent.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.760
Cost of living, inequality.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.560
They want to sweep away
the whole corrupt system.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.240
Businesses, government, the police.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.520
Bring about change.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.080
Is that what you want?

26:46.080 --> 26:48.160
No, I...

26:49.120 --> 26:51.280
I just want justice.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.200
Innocent people being blown to bits.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.160
Is that what you mean?
- No.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.400
No, I hate violence.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.680
Oh.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.000
Police officers killed.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.840
I had nothing to do with that.

26:59.840 --> 27:00.760
Nothing.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.640
I want to stop them.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.200
So, tech, what kind of tech?

27:06.400 --> 27:09.760
The CCTV at the power
station, I hacked it.

27:09.760 --> 27:10.800
Disabled it.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.640
[Lana] Drones?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.480
Yes.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.280
Drones, not bombs.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.240
No.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.840
I don't know anything about explosives.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.240
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.400
I was strictly on comms, but now

27:21.400 --> 27:23.080
they want me to be more involved.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.400
What do you want from us?

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
A deal.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.520
You know, I'll help you.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.080
I'll help you catch them.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.920
You give me immunity.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.480
So who pushed DCI
Youngblood down the lift?

27:38.480 --> 27:39.280
What?

27:39.280 --> 27:40.120
Don't act like you don't know.

27:40.120 --> 27:40.960
Yesterday.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.800
Who was it?

27:41.800 --> 27:42.640
Who pushed him?

27:42.640 --> 27:43.480
I don't know anything about that.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.000
Yeah, you're lying.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.200
You killed Thom as much as
the person that pushed him

27:47.200 --> 27:49.280
to his death.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.840
And now what, you're
lurking around in the dark,

27:51.840 --> 27:53.640
asking for help?

27:53.640 --> 27:56.560
I couldn't give a fuck
what you've been up to.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.440
You killed my colleagues,
you killed my friends.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.520
Lana, that's enough.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.480
I'm sorry.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.960
Are you?

28:04.960 --> 28:06.200
I didn't want that, I didn't,

28:06.200 --> 28:08.840
I didn't want any of this.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.920
I lost someone, too.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.720
I know what it's like--
- Okay.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.440
I made a mistake,
fine, a terrible mistake.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.200
But I was grieving.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.240
And now I'm here trying to put it right.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.040
Okay.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.120
All right.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.680
We need to know what
they're planning next.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.000
It could be anything.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.480
They love playing games.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.240
They're messing with your heads.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.360
That is a direct
contradiction of my orders.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.000
Only meet in an open space

28:38.000 --> 28:39.520
with full surveillance,

28:39.520 --> 28:40.960
armed offices and snipers in place.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.920
What is it about that
you didn't understand?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.400
To be fair to Helen, sir,

28:45.400 --> 28:47.080
she wanted to meet outside, I went in.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.680
And what have you got, hm?

28:48.680 --> 28:50.080
No firm ID.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.040
No useful information that
we can act on right now.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.880
Nothing to help us with that,

28:54.880 --> 28:56.520
which is counting down
pretty fucking fast.

28:56.520 --> 28:59.040
Sir, we could have arrested him.

28:59.040 --> 28:59.880
We could have brought him in,

28:59.880 --> 29:01.920
but then what would we have now?

29:01.920 --> 29:03.080
He's willing to stay on the inside.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.440
He's willing to feed us information.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.360
Isn't that worth something?

29:06.360 --> 29:08.040
Isn't that a lot more than
what we had three hours ago?

29:08.040 --> 29:08.880
Yeah.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.960
If it's real.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.080
Batra.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.560
Sir?

29:13.560 --> 29:17.960
Give everything we've got
on Nick Hood to this Alex.

29:19.480 --> 29:22.720
(Helen clears throat)

29:22.720 --> 29:25.800
Any news on, er, CCTV firefighter?

29:25.800 --> 29:27.000
Oh, no, not yet.

29:27.000 --> 29:27.840
But there's got to be something.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.240
The building is covered in cameras.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.320
Any nearby streets?

29:30.320 --> 29:31.400
Yeah, I will let you
know when I find anything.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.480
Okay.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.360
[Officer] Lana?

29:37.360 --> 29:38.200
Yes?

29:38.200 --> 29:40.360
Your mum is downstairs.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
Mum.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.560
(Lana's mum gasps)

29:46.560 --> 29:47.480
What are you doing here?

29:47.480 --> 29:49.040
Lana!

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
Hiya, luv.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.360
I saw on the news.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.960
Thom.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.840
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.440
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.880
Such a terrible thing.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.840
Terrible, terrible thing.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.440
A man like Thom was,

30:02.440 --> 30:03.680
good, decent man.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.160
You must be devastated, luv.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.840
I'm all right, I'm just
getting on with the job.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.160
Well, you can't bottle it up.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.000
You hear me?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.040
You can't.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.480
It's not good for you.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.320
I've done that with Billy

30:13.320 --> 30:16.240
and look at the state of me. (chuckles)

30:16.240 --> 30:17.160
Are you all right?

30:17.160 --> 30:20.960
You know, I remember the first
time you brought Thom home.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.040
He was so handsome.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.360
I said to your dad, I said,
"That boy's a keeper."

30:27.360 --> 30:31.160
I told him, I said, "She deserves
someone good in her life."

30:31.160 --> 30:32.520
You do.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.520
I've got, erm...

30:34.520 --> 30:35.960
I've got a lot of work on.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.040
So let me put you in a taxi.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.360
No need, I'll just hop on the bus.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.240
Okay, well, I'll come over after work.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.320
I'll pick up a curry on the way.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.800
No.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.960
No, I don't want you
coming round the house.

30:44.960 --> 30:45.920
Why not?

30:45.920 --> 30:48.480
Because things are
all wrong at the moment.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.280
I don't want you in the middle of it.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
Well, I'm a grownup, Mum.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.120
I understand that--

30:53.120 --> 30:53.960
No.

30:53.960 --> 30:54.840
No, Lana.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.600
You have no idea.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.840
No idea.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.200
Me and your dad, it's just awful.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.560
It's horrible.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.640
I don't want you involved.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.560
No child should see
their parents like this.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.480
I'm not a child, Mum.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.680
[Lana's Mum] I'm sorry!

31:07.680 --> 31:10.520
(dramatic music)

31:28.360 --> 31:31.680
(computer chimes)

31:31.680 --> 31:34.280
(tense music)

31:43.680 --> 31:45.680
Hi.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.640
I thought it was time
that we met properly.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.520
We've been impressed, last few months.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.600
Hacking CCTV.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.760
The cameras.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.120
We think you're ready to step up,

32:02.120 --> 32:03.400
become a trusted member of the team.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.240
Yeah?

32:05.240 --> 32:07.120
We want you to set up a system for us.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.040
We've got 12 cameras.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.720
They all need to transmit top
quality images in realtime.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.640
That something you can do?

32:14.640 --> 32:15.840
Er...

32:15.840 --> 32:16.640
Yeah.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.480
[Man] Great.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.320
[Alex] Yeah.

32:18.320 --> 32:22.040
[Man] Maybe you can check them out now.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.040
First we need you to upload this.

32:27.040 --> 32:30.360
Make sure it can't be traced back to us.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.480
Why didn't you tell me
what state she was in?

32:42.480 --> 32:43.800
So sorry, luv.

32:43.800 --> 32:44.960
I didn't want to worry you.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.440
[Lana] Right, well, you've
got to deal with this, Dad.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.280
Look after her.

32:47.280 --> 32:48.120
Yeah.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.080
I'll call you when I finish work.

32:50.080 --> 32:50.920
See you in a bit.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.000
Bye.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.880
(tense music)

33:01.720 --> 33:02.600
This uploaded 10 minutes ago.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.040
It's already got over
half a million views.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.720
(tense music)

33:08.760 --> 33:10.960
Any joy with the circuit diagram?

33:10.960 --> 33:13.760
No, sir, Porton Down
don't recognise what it is.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.800
They're not even sure
it is a circuit diagram.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.880
What if it isn't?

33:20.360 --> 33:23.480
Under the streets, the beach.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.560
So?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
So what if they've made a mistake?

33:28.000 --> 33:30.080
Their first mistake?

33:30.880 --> 33:32.360
Right, they put a timer in the newsroom.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.360
And with that timer came this card.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.960
"Welcome to the Labyrinth."

33:39.960 --> 33:41.080
What is that?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.320
A puzzle?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.400
A maze?

33:45.320 --> 33:48.920
And then we find this in the bomb factory.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.840
What if this is under the streets?

33:53.000 --> 33:54.880
I mean there is no way that they know

33:54.880 --> 33:57.520
what Nick Hood said to me
in that interview room.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.360
He just spat it out.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.600
Right, but if we put all
these pieces together...

34:03.600 --> 34:06.719
(sighs) I think this could be a map.

34:06.719 --> 34:08.840
And that could indicate the target.

34:08.840 --> 34:09.680
Yeah.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.960
Get every plan of the
underground you can.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.400
Any stretches of the network
that have been abandoned,

34:14.400 --> 34:16.240
notify the Royal Engineers,
put them on standby.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.960
CTSFO as well.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.360
As soon as we have a location, we go.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.720
Right.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.320
(tense music)

34:43.000 --> 34:45.280
(Batra sighs)

34:45.280 --> 34:47.960
(tense music)

34:52.360 --> 34:54.240
That's it.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.960
Sir!

34:55.960 --> 34:58.040
What is it?

34:59.760 --> 35:01.000
It's the Strand.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.360
(tense music)

35:03.360 --> 35:06.200
(sirens blaring)

35:09.280 --> 35:11.240
Right, we have a possible target.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.920
About eight feet above the tunnels

35:12.920 --> 35:14.920
is a fiber-optic cable network.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.840
It's worth billions to
the financial sector

35:16.840 --> 35:18.240
and the treasury.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.160
And it's right under
bloody Central London.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.160
- Understood, sir.
- Good.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.480
Washington, is the entrance clear?

35:22.480 --> 35:24.680
Er, no, the station's disused.

35:24.680 --> 35:25.520
No access.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.600
We'll have to blow it.

35:28.800 --> 35:32.640
(controlled explosion blasts)

35:36.920 --> 35:39.520
(tense music)

35:44.760 --> 35:45.520
[Officer] Moving in.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.320
[Officer] Keep tight.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.160
[Commander] Stand close.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.000
Heads up at least one point.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.080
Move forward, eyes on.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.960
There's a tarp fallen.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.600
Searchers, you're up.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.680
(devices whirring and chirping)

36:16.920 --> 36:20.280
[Officer] Sierra 1-7
to Expo-2, possible IED.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.680
[Lana] Right, keep everyone back.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.320
(tense music)

36:31.440 --> 36:33.160
Possible pressure plate.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.680
Thanks, I'll take a look.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.240
(tense music)

36:56.840 --> 36:59.520
(mobile buzzes)

37:09.760 --> 37:11.520
(door slams)

37:11.520 --> 37:14.400
(Alex clears throat)

37:14.400 --> 37:17.000
(tense music)

37:20.240 --> 37:23.160
(traffic rumbling)

37:25.680 --> 37:27.040
Expo-2 to all units.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.560
We're about to carry out
a controlled explosion.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.000
(controlled explosion blasts)

37:32.000 --> 37:35.120
(metal clanks)

37:35.120 --> 37:37.760
(tense music)

37:50.800 --> 37:51.760
Clear.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.840
Hoax device.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.120
[Helen] (on voicemail)
Hello, you're through to

37:55.120 --> 37:55.960
DS Helen Morgan.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.800
I'm sorry I missed your call,

37:56.800 --> 37:57.840
but I'll get back to you soon as I can.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.920
Thanks.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.720
(mobile camera clicks)

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
You got it set?

38:17.960 --> 38:20.960
(footsteps thumping)

38:20.960 --> 38:23.880
(device whirring)

38:28.080 --> 38:30.920
(tense music)

38:30.920 --> 38:32.520
Find!

38:32.520 --> 38:33.640
Everyone back!

38:33.640 --> 38:35.720
Expo!

38:40.200 --> 38:44.000
Head height tripwire, box is either side.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.560
(tense music)

38:55.480 --> 38:56.920
(controlled explosion blasts)

38:56.920 --> 38:57.720
[Lana] Clear.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.080
Copy that.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.680
(tense music)

39:02.760 --> 39:05.760
[Lana] Hoax devices, both of them.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.280
But there's nothing down here.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.560
It's an old tactic.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.880
The IRA used it all the time in Belfast.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.640
Keep us busy with hoax devices,
enact a plan elsewhere.

39:14.640 --> 39:17.000
Yeah, or it's hoax
device after hoax device

39:17.000 --> 39:18.280
and then the real thing.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.160
That's what the Taliban did.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.320
52 minutes, Wash.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.920
Yeah.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.320
Same MO as before.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.880
Tripwire with two boxes attached,

39:25.880 --> 39:28.200
pressure plates like we
saw at the power station,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.400
the carpark.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.840
They used a light sensor
for the collar bomb.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.360
What if they're using light sensors?

39:32.360 --> 39:34.080
We've got torches,
they're going to activate.

39:34.080 --> 39:38.560
We could use NVGs, but
you'd have to take the lead.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.000
[Officer] Expo-2, we've got an IED.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.560
Light sensor, as well.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.360
[Lana] Right.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.960
Hass, we're gonna need to
cover the light sensor.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.760
Have you got any electrical tape?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
Ta.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.320
Ah!

40:08.320 --> 40:09.680
Oh, shit.

40:09.680 --> 40:10.920
[Hass] It's a motion sensor.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.560
The lights triggered it.

40:12.560 --> 40:14.280
Oh, God.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.880
Fuck.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.720
[Hass] Okay, erm...

40:16.720 --> 40:17.560
Shit.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.400
Right.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.280
That's about three kilogrammes of RDX.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.960
Once that ball hits that plate,

40:21.960 --> 40:24.480
this tunnel's coming down.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.800
Right, disconnect the dynamite!

40:25.800 --> 40:26.640
I'll do it.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.480
[Hass] Wash, I've got this.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.320
Wash, please trust me!

40:28.320 --> 40:29.720
- Hass--
- Wash, not the time.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.560
Please!

40:30.560 --> 40:31.360
[Lana] Move quick!

40:31.360 --> 40:32.760
There, now, you
breathe, breathe, breathe.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.320
I got this.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.040
Where are you?

40:37.040 --> 40:38.200
All right.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.040
Just hold on, hold on.

40:39.040 --> 40:39.960
Right, you're about halfway now.

40:39.960 --> 40:40.800
Yeah, I--

40:40.800 --> 40:41.600
You're gonna have to move, Hass.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.640
Yep, breathe, just hang on.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.480
(snips wire)

40:43.480 --> 40:45.560
Done.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.200
It's still moving.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.760
I've cut the wires.

40:48.760 --> 40:49.840
You've not got it.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.840
Keep going.

40:50.840 --> 40:51.640
Okay.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.480
[Lana] Come on, Hass.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.360
Shit.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.200
Quick!

40:55.200 --> 40:56.040
(suspenseful music)

40:56.040 --> 40:58.120
It's done, it's okay.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.680
That was close.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.760
Hey, you all right?

41:07.760 --> 41:08.520
Wash.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.360
Yes?

41:09.360 --> 41:10.960
Look.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.040
The shits.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.240
"Catch us if you..."

41:18.240 --> 41:20.720
(Lana exhales)

41:20.720 --> 41:22.800
Look.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.880
(tense music)

41:38.720 --> 41:40.880
You need to upload this.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.560
(tense music)

41:47.840 --> 41:49.680
They got us down there,
there was no timer.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.760
It was our movement that activated it.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.200
And they're feeding us all
these pieces of the puzzle.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.960
Like the diagram, the
little piece of wire,

41:56.960 --> 41:58.960
that video they put out
at just the right moment.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.040
Yeah, but it wouldn't have made sense

42:00.040 --> 42:01.800
without Nick's outburst.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.120
They didn't know about that.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.640
I mean, he made a mistake.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.160
Unless that was deliberate.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.640
I mean, the solicitor
was in there with him.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.440
She could have given him something.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.520
Well, like what?

42:18.240 --> 42:20.600
An instruction from outside.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.520
He fed us that line.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.840
Yep.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.360
"Sous les paves, la plage."

42:24.360 --> 42:25.400
What exactly are you saying?

42:25.400 --> 42:28.160
That there has to be another bomb.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.360
The time has not run out yet.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.840
We only have a few minutes.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.480
(tense music)

42:38.520 --> 42:39.280
Thank you.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.040
See you soon.

42:41.040 --> 42:44.360
(tense music)

42:44.360 --> 42:46.160
(officers chattering)

42:46.160 --> 42:47.200
(mobile buzzing)

42:47.200 --> 42:48.840
Oh, that'll be...

42:48.840 --> 42:51.400
(tense music)

42:56.440 --> 42:57.200
Shit!

42:57.200 --> 42:58.040
[Officer] You got the same thing?

42:58.040 --> 42:58.880
[Officer] Yeah.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.080
(mobile rings)

43:02.080 --> 43:02.920
Hello?

43:02.920 --> 43:03.880
I've been calling you.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.000
I've been calling both of you!

43:05.000 --> 43:06.400
Where have you been?

43:06.400 --> 43:08.800
[Lana] Underground, no signal.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.320
I sent Helen a pic.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.920
I sent it to Batra, too.

43:11.920 --> 43:12.760
Here.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.480
Right, do you recognise him?

43:14.480 --> 43:16.760
There was a messaging
app open on the laptop.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.080
I sent you his profile pic.

43:18.080 --> 43:18.920
[Lana] Who is he?

43:18.920 --> 43:19.760
What's his name?

43:19.760 --> 43:20.560
I don't know.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.400
I've been trying to get through to...

43:21.400 --> 43:22.880
(passersby chattering)

43:22.880 --> 43:24.960
Right.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.320
(group chattering)

43:37.360 --> 43:41.520
(claps) Right, let's get to it.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.560
Clear up this mess.

43:43.560 --> 43:46.360
(all laughing)

43:46.360 --> 43:47.880
Quick, sir, have you got the pic?

43:47.880 --> 43:48.720
Yep.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.080
We're just putting it
through facial recognition

43:50.080 --> 43:52.240
with GCHQ.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.080
The message is simple.

43:54.080 --> 43:58.480
We are a caring party, we
believe in opportunity for all,

43:58.480 --> 44:01.240
but there's no such thing as a free lunch.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.720
Anything?

44:02.720 --> 44:05.280
(tense music)

44:06.200 --> 44:07.200
Sir, come on.

44:07.200 --> 44:08.880
Oh, okay, got it.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.920
All right, it's Oliver Jenkins.

44:10.920 --> 44:14.240
He's Special Advisor to Cabinet
Minister Matthew Palfrey.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.040
Oliver Jenkins.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.120
Where does he work?

44:17.920 --> 44:19.440
Sir, come on, where does he work?

44:19.440 --> 44:24.680
Carlyle House, just off the Strand.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.480
All right, that's nearby.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.560
Come on, let's move!

44:29.720 --> 44:32.840
Money has been diverted to
other areas of the country

44:32.840 --> 44:35.680
because they've managed
to prove their need.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.760
Argue a robust case.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.640
Move!

44:42.640 --> 44:44.080
(suspenseful music)

44:44.080 --> 44:46.160
Here!

44:47.000 --> 44:48.880
Of course we're concerned

44:48.880 --> 44:52.280
that any communities
are suffering, deprived.

44:52.280 --> 44:56.200
But any suggestions of
cronyism are misplaced.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.840
(tense music)

45:01.000 --> 45:01.760
Open the gate!

45:01.760 --> 45:03.160
Where's Matthew Palfrey?

45:03.160 --> 45:04.200
Er, first floor meeting room.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.560
- Right.
- Thank you.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.680
The end of the day, people need to

45:06.680 --> 45:08.920
put their shoulder to the wheel,

45:08.920 --> 45:11.000
graft a little.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.160
(suspenseful music)

45:16.480 --> 45:17.760
Firm, but fair, that's the message.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.240
