00:02.168 --> 00:05.438
   When we were in Junior High,
   Screech got me to write
   a love letter to Lisa.

00:05.471 --> 00:08.274
  Unfortunately, the letter
  fell into the wrong hands,

00:08.308 --> 00:10.410
 and Miss Bliss,
 our teacher wanted to kill me,

00:10.443 --> 00:12.645
   when Belding thought
   she was in love with him.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.147
  Hey, what are friends for?

00:23.723 --> 00:25.325
  Miss Bliss.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.260
 -Miss Bliss.
 -What is it, Samuel?

00:27.293 --> 00:28.795
 Um...

00:28.828 --> 00:32.465
 What is it called when
 a certain girl walks by
 and your knees turn to jelly,

00:32.499 --> 00:35.402
  and your stomach scrunches up
  like a tin-foil ball?

00:35.435 --> 00:38.838
 Well,
 it's either food poisoning
 or you're in love.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.541
  Sounds as if you're
  growing up, Samuel.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.843
 Well, that explains my boredom
 with <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

00:45.478 --> 00:46.813
  Miss Bliss?

00:46.846 --> 00:50.750
 How can you tell
 if that girl feels
 the same weird way about you?

00:50.784 --> 00:53.820
   -Well, you'll just know.
   -What?

00:53.853 --> 00:56.189
-Well, there are signs.
-Yeah?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.191
 -A look.
 -Yeah, yeah.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.460
   -A gentle touch of the hand.
   -Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:01.728 --> 01:03.063
   You'll just know.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.298
  Thanks, Miss Bliss.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.469
  -Bye bye.
  -Okay, bye.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.237
   Hi, Lisa.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.543
 She loves me!

01:17.777 --> 01:19.379
( bell rings )

01:19.412 --> 01:22.716
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:25.719
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:28.588
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

01:28.621 --> 01:32.325
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>

01:32.359 --> 01:36.196
 <i>* It's all right</i>

01:37.897 --> 01:40.900

01:40.934 --> 01:43.870

02:08.728 --> 02:11.765

02:11.798 --> 02:14.768

02:14.801 --> 02:18.538
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

02:28.882 --> 02:31.651
 Miss Bliss: <i>There's one thing</i>
 <i>you can count on every</i>
 <i>semester,</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:33.687
 <i>the classroom romance.</i>

02:33.720 --> 02:36.322
<i>Here I am writing</i>
<i>a lesson on the board.</i>

02:36.356 --> 02:39.693
 <i>There's my class</i>
 <i>watching me writing</i>
 <i>a lesson on the board.</i>

02:39.726 --> 02:44.597
  <i>Then there's Samuel, who's</i>
  <i>watching Lisa watching me</i>
  <i>write a lesson on the board.</i>

02:44.631 --> 02:47.467
   <i>I think you get my point.</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:52.439
 All right, copy down this list
 of military leaders
 of the War of 1812.

02:52.472 --> 02:55.408
  -Men. All men.
  -Naturally.

02:55.442 --> 02:59.713
 You know, there probably
 wouldn't be any wars at all if
 it weren't for men, Zack!

02:59.746 --> 03:00.714
( bell rings )

03:02.749 --> 03:03.783
 Not so fast.

03:04.784 --> 03:06.720
  A reminder.

03:06.753 --> 03:10.590
  Your term papers on the War
  of 1812 are due in at
  the end of the week.

03:10.623 --> 03:14.627
   This will account for
   20% of your final grade.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.364
All right,
out that door is the world.
Be careful.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.068
 Zack.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.771
  No excuses.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.741
 Miss Bliss,
 you're talking to the new me.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.776
 This year, study is my thing.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.612
 Of course! How could I forget?

03:32.645 --> 03:36.383
 Just don't turn in a cup of
 ashes as your report on the
 burning of the White House.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.917
  Okay?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.986
  That's a good one.
  You've got potential,
  Miss Bliss.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.654
Oh, thank you!

03:41.688 --> 03:43.790
  But it's not
  nearly as good as,

03:43.823 --> 03:47.727
  "My grandmother was reading
  my homework when she
  spontaneously combusted."

03:49.095 --> 03:51.331
You know, the old Zack
wasn't too bad either.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.139
   Hey, Screech. What's up?

03:59.172 --> 04:02.375
   Nothing, Zack.
   You know, same as always.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.577
 You know,
 I was just saying to myself,

04:04.611 --> 04:07.847
 "Zack,
 you don't spend enough time
 with your old buddy, Screech."

04:08.715 --> 04:09.749
   "Buddy?"

04:10.383 --> 04:11.851
You said that?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.754
 Through thick or thin.
 You got a problem? I'm here!

04:14.788 --> 04:17.057
Can't do your homework?
I'm your man!

04:17.057 --> 04:19.059
   -Likewise, Zack.
   -I'm glad you said that.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.127
  -Said what?
  -Homework.

04:21.161 --> 04:24.064
-I didn't say homework.
-You said likewise.
Same thing.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.534
 Now, what about this
 paper we have to do?

04:27.567 --> 04:30.403
   Forget it, Zack.
   I'm not doing your paper.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.439
   Look. You do this for me,

04:32.472 --> 04:35.809
and some day when
you need a favor,
 I'll be there.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.744
   -You will?
   -I swear.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.613
 Hold on. What about my favor?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.148
 Name it, pal.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.783
   I want a date with Lisa.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.886
 Lisa?

04:46.920 --> 04:50.390
 Lisa Turtle, the same Lisa who
 dumped SpaghettiOs on
 your head last week?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.092
That's the one!

04:53.860 --> 04:54.894
   No Lisa,

04:55.895 --> 04:56.930
   no paper.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.099
  No problem!

05:01.434 --> 05:04.871
   "And the moment our eyes met
   across the crowded room,

05:04.904 --> 05:07.107
 "I knew our fates
 were sealed as one."

05:07.140 --> 05:08.575
   One what?

05:08.608 --> 05:11.044
I don't know.
There's a period there.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.414
 Come on, don't stop,
 not even for commas.

05:14.447 --> 05:18.118
   "And our love,
   together, will soar
   through the pastel skies,

05:18.151 --> 05:21.688
 "and not touch down again
 until time ceases to exist."

05:21.721 --> 05:24.791
 And it's signed,
 "Your loving, secret admirer."

05:24.824 --> 05:26.192
 Lisa,

05:26.226 --> 05:29.662
you remember the time I
received a Valentine's
 card and you didn't,

05:29.696 --> 05:34.634
and later on in the day,
this huge card
mysteriously showed up,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.803
 and then you finally admitted,
 you sent it to yourself?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.673
 You think I
 wrote this to myself?

05:39.706 --> 05:41.074
Bingo.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.444
   Well, I didn't.
   May my fingernails break.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.514
   You are serious.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.484
 -Yo, Miss Bliss!
 -And yo to you, too.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.520
  Oh!

05:54.921 --> 05:57.557
 I hope someone here
 carries collision insurance.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.692
  Is everybody okay?

05:58.725 --> 06:00.026
How's my hair?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.561
  She's fine,

06:01.594 --> 06:03.096
  and late for class.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.397
   Bye, Miss Bliss.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.734
Oh, so you're
the famous Miss Bliss.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.370
 I didn't realize legends
 were allowed to be so pretty.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.040
  Pretty, I like.
  Legend, I can live without.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.309
  Hi. I'm Jerry Vick.

06:16.343 --> 06:20.046
 I know. And you're
 making quite a name
 for yourself around here, too.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.581
 You're kidding. With the kids?

06:21.614 --> 06:24.050
 No, with the female faculty.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.723
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.624
Well, no, Mr. Belding.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.860
 We just had a little accident.

06:33.893 --> 06:38.098
 Well, I don't mean to intrude,
 but if you two are
 here in the hallway,

06:38.131 --> 06:42.135
   that means there's no one
   in your classrooms except
   unsupervised young minds,

06:42.168 --> 06:44.971
 and that is
 a dangerous no-no, okay? Okay.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.076
 Well,
 it was very nice to meet you.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.911
   -These are yours.
   -Thanks.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.079
 Hope I bump into you.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.582
 Hope I run into you.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.083
 You know what I mean.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.818
 I know what you mean.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.021
 And when I see you coming,
 I'll hunk.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.056
  I mean, I'll honk.

07:10.030 --> 07:14.901
   -Simmons, B-plus.
   -Simmons, B-plus.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.703
 ( struggling to
 pronounce ) Slewyn...

07:16.736 --> 07:18.538
   Slunk...

07:18.571 --> 07:20.140
  Slewenga...

07:20.173 --> 07:21.675
  Do you know a kid named Al?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.044
   Slewyn Kowanski?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.046
 That's it.
 A-plus for the name.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.781
C-minus for the grade.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.752
"Our fates were
sealed as one."

07:35.221 --> 07:37.824
 -Tina...
 -It's this, it's hot.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.763
  "Our eyes met across
  the crowded room...

07:45.065 --> 07:46.199
"Pastel skies.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.736
 "Your loving, secret admirer."

07:49.769 --> 07:51.604
Where did you get this?

07:51.638 --> 07:56.142
Carrie, someone
sent you a love letter.

07:56.176 --> 07:59.346
 -Tina, this isn't mine.
 -Well, it was in your papers.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.551
  But it wasn't in my
  papers at the end of class.

08:04.584 --> 08:10.023
  And they never left my hands
  until I got home,
  except for the accident.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.891
   Accident? What accident?

08:11.925 --> 08:14.828
Oh, it was nothing.
I just bumped into
someone in the hallway.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.230
 I just bumped into Jerry Vick.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.766
   Aha! Jerry Vick!

08:19.799 --> 08:23.036
   Tina, you're making a very
   big deal out of nothing.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.839
  He just bumped into me,
  and told me I was a legend,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.141
   and told me I was pretty.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.049
 I wonder what he looks like.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.788
   Well, he's probably tall

08:42.889 --> 08:45.058
  and short.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.728
 Long brownish,
 blond, curly, straight hair,

08:48.762 --> 08:52.899
 with purple and gold
 weaved through the bald spots.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.068
Sounds dreamy.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.871
   Your mind's gone to mush.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.307
 Go ahead. Go.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.684
   -Hello, Mr. Vick.
   -Hi. It's Jerry.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.786
-Would you like to join me?
-Thank you.

09:17.857 --> 09:20.126
 Go ahead.
 Pretend I'm not here.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.030
  Now, um...

09:26.866 --> 09:28.935
I know we've just met.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.603
 I think she digs him.

09:32.138 --> 09:35.809
  But what I was
  trying to say was,

09:35.842 --> 09:37.610
   I've given this
   serious thought.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.146
   Serious thinking,
   I gave that up years ago.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.082
 I guess,
 that's why I'm a substitute.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.650
( both laugh )

09:43.683 --> 09:44.851
 Now, I'm sure of it.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.053
Now, I'm gone.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.926
 Jerry, I...
 It's like this. I...

09:52.959 --> 09:57.263
 I don't usually believe in
 fishing off the company pier.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.300
  What are you
  trying to tell me?

10:00.333 --> 10:04.671
   I think what I'm
   trying to say is,

10:04.704 --> 10:08.775
  I don't see why we couldn't
  go out when you're no
  longer subbing at JFK.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.178
  That's quite an invitation.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.147
 Can I bring my wife?

10:14.180 --> 10:16.216
   -You're married?
   -Happily married.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.450
   Happily married?

10:18.918 --> 10:21.121
-What about the letter?
-What letter?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.991
   The letter you
   obviously didn't send me.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.995
  Exactly what
  shade of red am I?

10:29.029 --> 10:32.832
  Don't be embarrassed.
  I'm really quite flattered.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.368
  Well, I'm glad I
  could make somebody's day.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.436
  Excuse me.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.873
   That must have
   been some letter.

10:42.942 --> 10:46.012
  Look at Lisa.
  We've got her daydreaming.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.214
 A million miles away.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.085
 You know, Screech.
 I should be bottled.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.420
 That letter was good.

10:53.453 --> 10:59.859
Absolutely! Her soul set
ablaze by the words of
her secret admirer.

10:59.893 --> 11:03.096
 -Where are you going?
 -To quell my
 woman's burning fire.

11:03.129 --> 11:06.966
 No. I think there's a rule
 prohibiting that
 during school hours.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.335
 But it's time to make my move.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.236
   No, it's time for
   you to trust me.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.139
 Again? For how long?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.342
 Long enough for you
 to finish my report,

11:15.375 --> 11:19.079
 and for me,
 to turn up the heat
 with another letter to Lisa.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.947
 I can't wait.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.882
Enjoy it. Love is pain.

11:24.551 --> 11:28.221
 Tina,
 Jerry didn't send the letter.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.524
 He didn't? Then who?

11:31.558 --> 11:34.527
 Was anybody else around
 when you dropped the papers?

11:34.561 --> 11:35.795
  Yes, but...

11:36.896 --> 11:38.331
 Oh, no, it can't be!

11:39.265 --> 11:41.301
   Who? Who?

11:42.335 --> 11:43.503
   Belding.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.115
   I can't believe Belding
   sent me that love letter.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.150
  Too creative, huh?

11:57.183 --> 12:01.788
  No, he's... He's Belding.
  He'd never do
  anything like this.

12:01.821 --> 12:02.922
  Miss Bliss.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.324
I'm outta here.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.458
   Make him suffer.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.794
 Tina, I'll never
 forgive you for this.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.299
 So, Mr. Belding, how are you?

12:13.333 --> 12:16.503
 Well, to be perfectly honest,
 I've been very, very lonely.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.437
Lonely?

12:17.470 --> 12:20.240
 My wife's in Vermont,
 visiting her sister.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.842
   Now, Miss Bliss, I believe
   we have
   something to talk about.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.210
   When's she getting back?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.112
-Not for weeks.
-Weeks?

12:26.146 --> 12:28.948
  Yes, weeks, but you're
  changing the subject on me.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.383
 Oh, what subject was that, Mr.
 Belding?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.853
 -You know what
 I'm talking about.
 -No, I don't.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.089
You haven't
responded to my notes.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.425
 Mr. Belding, I can't do that.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.260
   Why not?

12:40.293 --> 12:44.130
  Well, I...
  I'm not that kind of woman.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.500
 What kind of
 woman does it take
 to submit requisition forms?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.437
  Requisition forms.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.506
   I am that kind of woman.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.542
  Good, good.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.344
Then, I'll pick them up
in your
classroom after school.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.814
After school?
No, no. They'll, um...

13:00.847 --> 13:02.882
   They'll be ready
   sooner than that.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.785
 During class, when
 the students are still there.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.088
 Fine.

13:08.121 --> 13:13.059
 "And the glowing embers of
 a once burning heart,
 slowly dim,

13:13.059 --> 13:15.328
 "for another night
 will be spent alone."

13:15.362 --> 13:19.499
 -She's gone, Zack.
 I've lost her.
 -You haven't. Listen.

13:19.532 --> 13:25.071
 "If there is to be a future,
 meet me tomorrow, after
 school in the cafeteria."

13:25.872 --> 13:28.575
   Now this, is hot!

13:28.608 --> 13:30.210
  Really hot!

13:30.243 --> 13:31.978
   She's gonna burn.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.948
   Hey, not so fast.
   Where's my paper?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.951
  The deal was, your
  paper for a date with Lisa.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.587
Wait, that is not fair.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.089
 It never is in
 matters of the heart.

13:44.924 --> 13:45.959
  All right.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.964
 Careful with that. It burns.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.334
 Now, if we could just
 keep the noise down,

13:54.367 --> 13:58.505
   we can get started
   as soon as I finish
   these requisition forms.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.307
"Glowing embers...
Burning heart."

14:01.341 --> 14:04.277
"What could have been."
Nikki, I'm losing him.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.947
 The guy's a loser. He's afraid
 to step out from
 behind his typewriter.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.549
Nikka, maybe he's shy.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.185
  ( growls )

14:15.588 --> 14:20.293
 He's asked me to
 meet him today,
 after school in the cafeteria.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.096
   Cafeteria, how romantic!

14:23.129 --> 14:26.533
  What's the matter?
  Was the boiler room booked?

14:26.566 --> 14:31.237
   I think we'll just take this
   out of
   circulation during class.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.373
  Miss Bliss.

14:33.406 --> 14:38.845
  Now, last night's assignment
  was to read the chapter on
  the Battle of New Orleans.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.115
  Zack, would you tell
  us about it please?

14:42.148 --> 14:45.452
   Well, it was in New Orleans
   and what a battle it was!

14:47.587 --> 14:50.623
 Mr. Belding, come on in, sir!

14:51.524 --> 14:52.625
   Well, thank you.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.096
 -Miss Bliss.
 -Mr. Belding.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.931
 You know why I'm here,
 don't you?

14:57.964 --> 14:59.399
 -Yes.
 -So?

14:59.432 --> 15:02.535
   So... So... So...

15:02.569 --> 15:05.505
  So, where are my
  requisition forms?

15:05.538 --> 15:06.906
  They're on my desk.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.610
   Carry on.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.878
  ( laughs )

15:15.315 --> 15:17.384
 Where was I?

15:17.417 --> 15:22.288
 You were asking Zack about the
 Battle of New Orleans and he
 didn't know the answer.

15:22.322 --> 15:27.160
   Then again, this morning,
   I fell off the monkey bars
   and hit my head.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.462
   Is this Math class, Mom?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.074
  Miss Bliss.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.910
 Mr. Belding?

15:43.943 --> 15:46.079
 Mr. Belding, we have to talk.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.313
  Yes, we do.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.316
 Good,
 after all, we're both adults.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.420
  I see no reason why
  this should go any further.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.388
-I'm very sorry...
-Wait a minute.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.324
 Now, there's no
 reason for apologies.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.894
   You're absolutely right.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.531
 After all,
 you work very closely
 with somebody for a few years,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.200
you get to feel
comfortable with them,

16:07.233 --> 16:11.404
 and many, many times, you can
 mistake that closeness
 for something else.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.274
   Exactly, you know,
   I'm glad you understand.

16:14.307 --> 16:19.079
 And just between you and me,
 Miss Bliss, this type of thing
 has happened to me before.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.649
 All right, so I was in
 the Army at the time.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.152
  How you doing, Miss Bliss?

16:27.087 --> 16:27.921
 Mr. Belding.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.058
  What are you two
  guys talking about?

16:32.092 --> 16:35.428
 -The school. Mylo...
 -You know, I've been
 here for three years.

16:35.462 --> 16:39.566
  And I think we have the best
  darn Junior High School in
  all of Indianapolis.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.302
   You know, if I had kids,
   I'd want them to go here.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.270
   Of course,
   I'd have to get married.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.107
  Actually,
  first I'd have to get a date,
  so if you find...

16:47.140 --> 16:49.075
 Mylo.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.377
  See,
  we were talking privately.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.214
  I know, I know. I'm going.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.282
But I'm gonna find out
about this eventually.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.084
 The pipes have ears.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.555
 Remind me to have those fixed.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.592
   Where were we? Oh, yes...

17:05.625 --> 17:10.329
 Miss Bliss,
 I am very, very fond
 of you as a teacher.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.032
  But that's as far as
  it goes, I'm sorry.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.367
 -Mr. Belding.
 -Yes.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.371
What in the world
are you talking about?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.573
-The letter.
-Right.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.413
 -This letter.
 -No, no, this letter.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.481
   -Let me see that.
   -Let me see that.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.283
 -I didn't write this.
 -I didn't write this.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.951
 -I didn't write that.
 -I didn't write that.

17:34.354 --> 17:35.722
 Aha!

17:35.755 --> 17:38.091
  Aha, what?

17:38.124 --> 17:40.493
  Think I have
  a pretty good idea
  who's behind this.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.095
 Who?

17:43.630 --> 17:46.366
  Why should I tell you?
  You just dumped me.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.268
 ( chuckles )

17:48.301 --> 17:51.404
   Will you relax? Look,
   you don't want
   to be too early.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.406
  Yes, I do.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.345
 I want to be in the cafeteria,
 waiting,
 when my prince arrives.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.116
 Well,

18:03.149 --> 18:05.051
   -how do I look?
   -You look great.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.554
 -That's it?
 -What do you mean,
 "That's it"?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.589
I just told you,
you look great.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.325
  Looking great isn't enough.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.028
   I need to look fabulous.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.497
   Okay, you look fabulous.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.532
  You don't mean it.

18:19.566 --> 18:24.604
 I mean it.
 You look sensational,
 the best I have ever seen you.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.539
   I knew it. Wish me luck.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.547
   -You wanted to see us?
   -Sit down, boys.

18:38.485 --> 18:44.190
 Now, is there anything either
 of you want to tell me before
   I grade your term papers?

18:44.724 --> 18:45.759
 Nope.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.527
Samuel?

18:49.729 --> 18:53.500
 What exactly do you mean by...
 Nope.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.635
 Out with it, Samuel.

18:55.669 --> 18:58.805
 -I wrote Zack's paper.
 -Screech.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.141
   Sorry,
   I just can't help myself.

19:02.575 --> 19:06.379
And what did Zack promise
to give you in return?

19:06.413 --> 19:07.647
   Nothing, I swear.

19:07.681 --> 19:09.582
   He promised me
   a date with Lisa.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.188
 Sorry, you know I
 can't stand torture.

19:16.690 --> 19:20.727
 Lisa!
 Of course, she was there too.

19:20.760 --> 19:25.298
 And that's where these
 love letters come into play?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.666
Where'd you get those?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.436
  It's not important.

19:29.469 --> 19:33.039
   What is important, is they
   were typed on the
   same typewriter

19:33.073 --> 19:34.441
  as your term papers.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.076
   They were just
   harmless letters.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.578
Maybe harmless to you,

19:38.611 --> 19:41.781
but you have no idea
the embarrassment
they've caused.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.350
I'm sorry, Miss Bliss.

19:44.084 --> 19:46.186
 Zack,

19:46.219 --> 19:50.590
 a cute smile and apologies
 aren't going to
 get you through life,

19:50.623 --> 19:53.860
 neither is taking
 advantage of people.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.330
Can I at least
have another chance?
I'll do my own report.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.165
   I know you will.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.335
  Unfortunately, I'm
  grading this paper a zero.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.306
  A zero?
  That's the worst you can get.
  Can I at least have an F?

20:07.340 --> 20:08.441
 Zero!

20:10.510 --> 20:13.513
 As for you, Samuel,
 I can't let you go unpunished.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.582
  I'm lowering
  your grade to a D.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.251
 That'll be all, boys.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.586
Thank you, Miss Bliss.

20:21.621 --> 20:27.394
 Hey, Zack. What did Miss Bliss
 mean by you taking
 advantage of people?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.462
   She meant,
   I took advantage of you.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.663
   You did?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.399
Well, kind of.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.168
That's why I signed
all those letters,
"Your secret admirer."

20:35.702 --> 20:36.703
 Why?

20:36.736 --> 20:39.506
So Lisa wouldn't find out
it was you and scream.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.208
 Plus, I wanted my paper first.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.445
 You did take advantage of me.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.547
Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.418
Just forget it.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.953
   These last few days,
   they've been pretty good.

20:53.987 --> 20:57.724
 I mean, I've been in love.
 It's a great feeling.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.528
 Where are you going?

21:01.561 --> 21:03.663
 To the cafeteria,
 to meet Lisa.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.832
   Didn't you hear what I said?
   She's not going
   to go out with you.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.535
 I have to find out for myself.

21:08.568 --> 21:13.473
  Don't want to spend the rest
  of my life wondering if Zack
Morris was wrong.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.276
 You know, Screech,
 you're not such
 a bad guy after all.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.877
 Thanks, Zack.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.447
  Hey, Zack.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.717
You mind if I
told the other guys
you said that?

21:23.750 --> 21:24.851
 Yeah.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.621
  But go ahead and tell them.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.191
  Nah, they'd never
  believe me anyway.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.801
   ( Lisa screams )
