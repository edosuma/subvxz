WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:11.137
We are already seeing
beautiful results.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.891
You fixed her!
You fix things!

00:15.891 --> 00:18.018
You'll never believe
what happened.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.064
Supply depots.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.358
Marco sprung them up
all over the Belt.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.110
And at our current
rate of consumption,

00:26.110 --> 00:28.487
Ceres has only enough
food and air

00:28.487 --> 00:30.489
for approximately three weeks.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.743
- Mi na du nating mal.
- Im gut.

00:33.743 --> 00:34.910
Where's your embed?

00:43.836 --> 00:48.174
I will die before I live
at the end of your leash.

00:48.174 --> 00:51.677
Oh, fuck it. We tried.
Firing one.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.311
This is your fault.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.146
We didn't need
to kill James Holden.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.397
You are relieved of duty!

01:21.916 --> 01:25.461
I'm so sorry.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.680
I'm so sorry, boss.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.350
All the students
from Xan's class loved him.

01:39.350 --> 01:43.229
If there's anything the school
can do, please let us know.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.234
Apparently, the cart
came around the curve too fast

01:48.234 --> 01:50.820
and just tipped over.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.822
Poor little Xan.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.490
What's gonna happen
to the driver?

01:54.490 --> 01:55.866
What do you think?

01:57.701 --> 01:58.828
It was an accident.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.788
I guess it doesn't matter.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.249
One of the soldiers was talking
about a firing squad.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.140
You were supposed
to be in Paris.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.477
That was gonna be your parents'
posting after this.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.896
Back to Earth,
institute in Paris,

02:25.896 --> 02:28.691
going through all the data
they gathered here.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.442
You weren't
supposed to be here.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.486
Yeah, well,
I've never been to Earth.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.655
Me neither.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.073
I grew up on Mars.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.867
Hmm.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.122
Whatever you feel, it's okay.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.124
I know it's all right
to be sad.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.752
Grief is strange.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.591
It gets harder
when you've grown up,

02:53.591 --> 02:55.926
so we lie about it

02:55.926 --> 02:57.928
and say it's the same
as being sad.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.180
It's not like we mean to lie.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.142
Lies? Like what?

03:03.893 --> 03:05.019
Like, "It'll be all right."

03:07.521 --> 03:08.689
"We'll keep you safe."

03:08.689 --> 03:12.318
I mean we want to,
we try to, but...

03:12.318 --> 03:14.570
that's not how life works.

03:14.570 --> 03:19.283
Having something you love
that you can't protect...

03:19.283 --> 03:20.659
it's terrifying.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.703
Did you have a kid who died?

03:24.330 --> 03:27.666
No, no.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.084
I lost a place.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.628
Oh.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.713
It was a place
that mattered to me,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.507
and I thought
it would go on forever.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.092
Well, that's not true.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.969
I assumed it would,
like how you assumed

03:38.969 --> 03:40.471
Alexander would always be here.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.806
I never thought
it would fall apart,

03:42.806 --> 03:44.350
and then it did.

03:44.350 --> 03:47.895
It made me very sad

03:47.895 --> 03:51.315
and very, very angry
and frightened.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.736
When I was where you are now,

03:55.736 --> 03:59.406
I needed something to make it
more than just death.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.661
I needed to make it
a sacrifice.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.829
You know what
a sacrifice means?

04:05.829 --> 04:06.997
To give something up.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.583
Yeah, but it's more than that.

04:09.583 --> 04:14.755
It's... it's to give something
up and make it sacred.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.633
When you think about it
like that,

04:17.633 --> 04:19.009
it doesn't fix anything,

04:19.009 --> 04:22.179
but it makes losing them
hurt less.

04:22.179 --> 04:27.101
Your brother, Mars,
the dream of Mars,

04:27.101 --> 04:28.519
they still matter.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.563
We're doing
something good here.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.690
It's important.

04:34.525 --> 04:38.988
And if we win...

04:38.988 --> 04:40.614
it'll make all of this
worth it.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.784
Even the parts we had
to give up along the way.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.455
I don't wanna give him up.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.126
When those Rings opened,

04:52.126 --> 04:53.836
we all ran out
into the universe,

04:53.836 --> 04:55.295
like your brother
ran out into that road.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.463
No one could stop us.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.091
So instead,

04:59.091 --> 05:03.345
someone has to keep us safe,

05:03.345 --> 05:04.638
or at least try.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.224
I don't know if I still can,

05:07.224 --> 05:11.020
and if I can't...

05:11.020 --> 05:13.188
nothing matters then anyway.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.363
- Keep trying.
Admiral!

05:22.156 --> 05:24.658
I need Admiral Duarte. Now!

05:24.658 --> 05:25.659
- Thank you.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.621
Admiral!

05:34.626 --> 05:36.378
Sorry you didn't
get to see Paris.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.840
Maybe one day,
we'll have one of our own.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.847
Is there something wrong?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.640
My new coordination protocol

05:48.640 --> 05:51.602
returned a coherent
reply pattern.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.437
Show me.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.105
I think I can turn it on.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.440
I know I can.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.012
I understand
your anger and your fear,

07:50.012 --> 07:52.014
but you can't
let them blind you.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.892
This is not the time
to sell our future

07:54.892 --> 07:56.768
for the empty
promise of safety.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.146
We may never know for certain

07:59.146 --> 08:01.356
who vented our tanks,

08:01.356 --> 08:05.611
but we all know who is building
a future for the Belt!

08:05.611 --> 08:09.114
You will hear the Inners asking
us to take their side now.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.284
Don't put yourself back
under their yoke!

08:12.284 --> 08:14.286
Never again!
- Don't forfeit our future

08:14.286 --> 08:16.580
for a sip of water!

08:16.580 --> 08:19.166
They can't defeat us!

08:19.166 --> 08:23.128
But if we lose faith,
we can defeat ourselves.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.047
Now, the Inners
were offered peace

08:25.047 --> 08:26.757
if they stayed on their worlds.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.676
They chose to come here.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.971
And we will have peace again
after they leave.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.018
Beltalowda! Beltalowda!

08:40.437 --> 08:43.106
The explosives were Belter
mining charges.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.942
They were clearly
planted by Inaros.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.526
If we make
the evidence public...

08:46.526 --> 08:48.445
Sanjrani will call it a false flag,

08:48.445 --> 08:50.948
the latest in a long line
of Inner lies.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.450
It'll take more than that
to turn them against Marco.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.701
With all due respect,
ma'am,

08:54.701 --> 08:57.287
we are a Navy,
not a police force.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.539
With a fleet
that is not strong enough

08:59.539 --> 09:02.668
to turn the tide of this war
without allies in the Belt.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.712
15 UN Marines,
27 Martians dead.

09:05.712 --> 09:06.880
Belters died as well.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.757
And two brand-new frigates
out of commission.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.260
And for what?

09:11.260 --> 09:14.179
They don't want us here. Fine.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.557
MCRN Fleet Command recommends
that a joint strike force

09:17.557 --> 09:19.059
set out for the Ring
immediately,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.352
burning as hard as we can.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.771
Our stealth ships will take out
Marco's sentries,

09:22.771 --> 09:25.649
cripple Medina, and reassert
control of the Ring

09:25.649 --> 09:28.110
before the Free Navy
can get any more entrenched.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.237
Rushing headlong
to salve our pride

09:30.237 --> 09:33.740
and prove our manhood
is exactly what Inaros wants.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.201
I will not commit my forces
to that plan.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.251
I was glad to hear
you were all right.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.548
Darcy Okuda.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.217
Specialist,
East Asian Trade Zone.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.432
I heard her talking
to Sergeant Ebron,

10:40.432 --> 10:42.059
both competitive swimmers.

10:42.059 --> 10:45.979
They...they raced once...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.608
...in the Arabian Sea.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.360
They disagreed about who won.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.736
Ms. Stuart,
are you recording this?

10:52.736 --> 10:54.321
- Yes.
- Stop right now.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.615
You said I had full access.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.536
You're right. I did.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.025
The Joint Fleet
has our flight plan.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.570
They'll be tracking us
all the way in to Ceres.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.448
Hopefully, that means
no more surprises.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.784
That'd be nice.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.619
Still working up
that damage assessment?

11:42.619 --> 11:45.163
That's done.
Amos has the list.

11:46.832 --> 11:47.791
What are you doing?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.002
Going over our battle logs.

11:52.254 --> 11:55.257
The Roci gathered
a lot of data on the Pella,

11:55.257 --> 11:58.301
high-resolution drive
signatures and hull profiles.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.803
I'm compiling all of it.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.805
I'm gonna send it out
fleet-wide.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.765
Someone will find that ship.

12:09.104 --> 12:10.856
Okay. Tight-beam comms only.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.113
Hull's okay overall,

12:18.113 --> 12:19.656
but there's a chunk
of something wedged

12:19.656 --> 12:21.867
in the swing arm of PDC-4.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.201
We need to clear it out.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.412
We may have to replace
some hydraulics.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.330
Sounds like
a two-man job.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.124
Happy to pitch in.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.625
Yeah, okay.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.960
We're out of spec pistons,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.879
but I'm seeing if there's
another kind I can modify.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.547
All right,
just give me the word

12:35.547 --> 12:36.590
and I'll put us on the float.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.008
Aye, aye.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.263
-
- Fuck!

12:45.432 --> 12:47.809
Still pissed off
about the Pella?

12:49.186 --> 12:51.146
- Aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.953
This is Alex's music.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.997
Yeah, he used to play
this stuff

13:08.997 --> 13:10.540
all the time on the Razorback.

13:10.540 --> 13:14.002
Said there wasn't
any other music onboard.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.087
- I think he was lying.
Probably.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.216
He used to play it
all the time here too.

Hey, Amos.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.546
There's something
I need you to take a look at.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.838
I'm in the Cargo Bay.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.632
Okay, Peaches.
I'm on my way.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.558
What's up?

14:12.811 --> 14:15.564
So I did a full torpedo
diagnostic like you told me to.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.274
All remaining missiles
checked out fine.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.317
Then what do I need
to look at?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.194
Well, since the dud

14:21.194 --> 14:23.154
checked out fine
prelaunch, too,

14:23.154 --> 14:26.116
I figured there might be
some wider system glitch.

14:26.116 --> 14:30.328
So I drilled down
into the weapons telemetry log,

14:30.328 --> 14:31.496
and I found this.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.754
<i>♪ ♪</i>

14:39.754 --> 14:43.174
This is way above my pay grade,
and I'm not trying to judge.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.012
I'll handle it.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.028
We are salvaging what we can

15:03.028 --> 15:05.113
from the Lauber,
but the ship a wreck.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.906
Will have to be abandoned.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.242
But Lauber crew got one
repair skiff operational,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.744
headed for you now,
fully loaded.

15:10.744 --> 15:11.745
Help fix you up faster.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.582
The least they could do,
after the way

15:15.582 --> 15:19.210
they distinguished themselves
in battle, wouldn't you say?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.630
Soyá, Bosmang.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.843
After salvage operations
are complete,

15:26.843 --> 15:28.053
take the two
senior-most officers

15:28.053 --> 15:29.429
of the Lauber and space them.

15:31.556 --> 15:34.934
Understood. Granicus out.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.395
I think it's
counter-productive to...

15:37.395 --> 15:39.439
If the Captain
of the Granicus calls

15:39.439 --> 15:44.110
and tries to get you
to change my mind,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.655
have him put outside as well.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.956
Oye.
- Where the fuck have you been?

15:57.749 --> 16:00.001
You're lucky the repair skiff
is not here yet, or...

16:02.837 --> 16:04.422
Sorry.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.175
I...I did not mean to offend.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.259
I thought you were...

16:08.259 --> 16:09.761
I'm the new repair technician.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.013
I was reassigned.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.058
Oh, okay.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.317
Where would you like to start?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.528
Don't know; I haven't done
a hull repair before.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.324
You're in charge.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.617
Tell me what to do.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.954
Okay, uh...

16:35.954 --> 16:37.664
you know how to operate
a maintenance skiff?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.708
- No.
Oh.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.545
Well, I'm sure
you'll take to it.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.797
I mean, for you,
with all you've done,

16:45.797 --> 16:46.631
it will be simple.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.465
Filip.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.351
Still angry?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.894
Why would I be?

16:59.894 --> 17:02.021
What your father said to you
wasn't right.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.898
You fought bravely,

17:03.898 --> 17:05.191
but he's
the commander in chief,

17:05.191 --> 17:06.443
and we're still at war.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.361
His focus needs to be
on the battle.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.822
He can't be distracted by you.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.823
You need to fix this.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.033
You want me
to apologize to him.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.618
I know it's hard to understand

17:15.618 --> 17:19.748
when all you see is how much
our people love him,

17:19.748 --> 17:21.082
but he is alone.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.293
You are the only family
he has left.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.837
He needs you at his side
to give him support

17:25.837 --> 17:28.256
and counsel,
the kind that no one else can.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.675
You think you know my father?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.012
You think you know me?

17:34.888 --> 17:37.515
What do you think he would do
if I shot you in the face?

17:38.266 --> 17:39.726
I don't know.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.895
Feel really guilty about it,

17:41.895 --> 17:45.523
then send money to my family
and pretend it's remorse.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.319
Lauber-RS-1 on final approach.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.654
All hands, stand by
to cut thrust for dock.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.031
I've got a job to do.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.575
Ready to go?

18:15.637 --> 18:16.721
Well, it'll work,

18:16.721 --> 18:18.598
but it's a far cry
from mil-spec.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.060
-
- Uh-huh.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.939
We should probably do
a test fire, then recheck it.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.774
My guess is we'll probably see
torque fractures.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.113
Okay, that's on the schedule.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.413
Amos, you okay?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.542
I only ask 'cause you're
talking even less than usual.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.798
If you want, I can lock you
out of fire control.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.765
The last torpedo
we fired at the Pella,

19:00.765 --> 19:02.350
it wasn't a dud.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.228
Yeah.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.356
See, here's my problem.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.152
I trust you
to do the right thing.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.946
- What you think it is.
- But?

19:14.946 --> 19:18.867
We had a chance to end Marco,

19:18.867 --> 19:20.159
and you pulled the punch.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.412
Now, I keep trying,

19:22.412 --> 19:24.539
but I can't see
how that was a right thing.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.041
It was a gut decision
in the moment,

19:27.041 --> 19:28.293
but I made the call.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.714
See, you're gonna need
to explain that to me,

19:32.714 --> 19:35.049
because if we're not trying
to win this fight,

19:35.049 --> 19:36.968
I don't know
what I'm doing out here.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.178
It was my call to make,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.014
and I don't owe you
a fucking explanation.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.932
Are you pissed at me
for asking?

19:44.684 --> 19:48.271
Or because you don't have
an explanation to give?

20:14.797 --> 20:17.425
Press the new plate in hard.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.761
Make it perfectly flush
with the others,

20:19.761 --> 20:22.680
just like this,
or the weld will be weak.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.141
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.936
Now you try.

20:27.936 --> 20:28.937
Al...already?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.897
Got a lot
of holes to patch.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.871
Good. Good, ya.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.039
Keep going.

20:58.633 --> 20:59.926
...and three Belter bodies

20:59.926 --> 21:02.011
pulled from
the shattered dock bridge,

21:02.011 --> 21:05.431
bringing total casualties
so far to 976.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.433
Meanwhile, a thousand...

21:07.433 --> 21:08.393
Shit.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.603
Tadeo. Tadeo!

21:10.603 --> 21:11.980
We've got a problem.
The plate fell off.

21:11.980 --> 21:12.814
Pashang!

21:14.732 --> 21:17.068
We don't got any of those
Duster hull plates to spare.

21:17.068 --> 21:18.236
It's big trouble if we lose it.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.654
You distracted me.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.538
Got it.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.964
You had to look at the news
now, while we work?

21:43.886 --> 21:46.472
My brother is a dockworker
on Ceres.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.642
I haven't heard from him
since the water tank explosion.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.645
I'm just worried.
It won't happen again.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.646
I promise.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.692
Your skiff, your rules.

22:04.824 --> 22:08.536
You and your brother,
are you close?

22:08.536 --> 22:11.330
Oh, ya.
Ya, me and Mas...

22:11.330 --> 22:12.248
"Mass"?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.083
Mas. Masan.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.960
It's just us two.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.089
One day, our parents
don't come back from a rock.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.259
Mas took me in on Ceres.

22:23.885 --> 22:24.886
I was seven.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.847
I remember thinking
how weird it was,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.767
'cause until then, he was
a real shit for a brother.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.645
Rob pachinko machines,
steal air scrubbers,

22:34.645 --> 22:36.189
sell black market water.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.941
Anything he could sell,
he would steal.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.277
For a while, I thought
he was going to sell me.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.615
I know.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.075
No, he keep me out of trouble.

22:47.075 --> 22:50.078
One of those people
good at looking out for others,

22:50.078 --> 22:52.121
bad at looking out for himself,
you know what I mean?

22:56.334 --> 22:58.669
So why isn't he here
with you?

22:58.669 --> 22:59.670
He didn't join up?

23:01.756 --> 23:05.009
He...he cannot go outside.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.220
- You sure he Belter?
-

23:07.220 --> 23:10.598
No, he has a condition,
a vertigo.

23:10.598 --> 23:13.226
Anytime he is out in vacuum,
he gets dizzy,

23:13.226 --> 23:15.353
blackout, vomit in his helmet.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.565
And he joke about it,
but it always bother him.

23:21.609 --> 23:26.405
If not for that, I think he
would have left Ceres long ago,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.950
and I probably would have been
on a prison barge.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.790
I just hope he's okay.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.581
Filip looks a lot like you.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.960
When I gave Marco
the chance to surrender,

24:20.960 --> 24:22.461
I saw Filip on the screen.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.257
I did too.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.134
With our torpedo
bearing down on them,

24:28.134 --> 24:29.844
he just looked so scared.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.681
Why are you telling me this?

24:33.681 --> 24:35.141
The torpedo didn't fail.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.809
I disarmed it.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.021
I haven't lost my mind.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.233
I know what that choice meant,
but I couldn't kill your son.

24:44.233 --> 24:48.654
If you let Marco escape
to spare my feelings,

24:48.654 --> 24:50.198
you just made me responsible

24:50.198 --> 24:51.782
for everyone he kills
from now on.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.117
You're not responsible
for my choices.

24:53.117 --> 24:56.329
Then stop making yourself
responsible for mine.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.664
I almost ruined the raid
on the Azure Dragon,

24:58.664 --> 25:00.291
and you only worried
about my emotional state.

25:00.291 --> 25:03.878
And now we let the flagship
of the Free Navy escape

25:03.878 --> 25:05.504
because of me?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.798
Stop treating me
like I am broken.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.551
Stop pretending like what
you're feeling doesn't matter.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.471
What you went through
on the Pella...

25:13.471 --> 25:15.056
I see how much it hurts you

25:15.056 --> 25:18.142
every time we kill
another Belter ship.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.977
You're trying to carry
all of this by yourself,

25:19.977 --> 25:21.020
and you can't.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.021
If Filip hurts
more people, then...

25:22.021 --> 25:23.022
It's not about Filip

25:23.022 --> 25:24.649
or what he might
or might not do.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.858
It's about us.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.027
I can't be the one
who kills your son.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.156
It won't matter
that we were at war

25:32.156 --> 25:34.116
or that he was on
the other side.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.868
Every time you wake up,

25:35.868 --> 25:37.954
you'll be lying next
to the reason your boy is dead.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.122
- Jim, I...
- I can't be that to you.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.627
I don't have it in me.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.966
I went to save Filip,

25:49.966 --> 25:51.175
and I failed.

25:53.177 --> 25:56.013
If we win, he may die.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.184
- I know that.
- Knowing it isn't enough.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.520
I could have stayed
on the Pella, martyred myself

26:02.520 --> 26:07.984
in the name of motherhood,
but I chose not to.

26:09.277 --> 26:10.987
I know I tried.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.197
Please don't take that from me.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.035
It's all I have left.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.712
Ah, pashang,
I should have brought a net.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.385
So we have to deal
with all the big shit first.

26:34.385 --> 26:35.386
Oh, okay.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.563
Take a look at this one.
Whoo!

26:45.563 --> 26:46.564
Shit.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.451
What have we got here?

26:58.451 --> 27:00.828
That's a torpedo warhead.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.419
It's a nuke.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.004
That's the dud.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.464
If this had gone off...

27:11.464 --> 27:14.258
We wouldn't be here
talking about it now.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.677
Marco Inaros is blessed.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.057
What you doing?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.934
We need to see
if it's still armed.

27:23.934 --> 27:26.062
- No, that's not a good idea.
- Come on. Just give me a hand.

27:26.062 --> 27:29.315
- No, get away from there.
- I...I'm stuck!

27:29.315 --> 27:31.442
- Don't move.
- Get me out of here!

27:31.442 --> 27:32.526
Don't move!

27:37.573 --> 27:39.325
What...what the fuck?

27:42.453 --> 27:45.706
It's in fail-safe.
It must have malfunctioned.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.250
You wanna know
what you looked like?

27:48.250 --> 27:50.419
You're an asshole.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.464
-
- Pashang.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.966
Come on, we shall
take this in now.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.344
We can come back and finish
the small stuff later.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.810
All this on the float

28:47.810 --> 28:49.812
while Marco lets
the Belt starve.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.398
A revolution that doesn't
make you rich

28:52.398 --> 28:54.150
is hardly worth having, huh?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.026
Cut the chatter.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.279
First team, with me.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.050
- Grapples ready.
-

29:20.050 --> 29:21.051
Fire.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.692
First team has made contact.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.319
We're entering the station now.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.696
Still no ships on scopes,
but hurry.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.507
First team is in.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.135
Second team is grappled

30:03.135 --> 30:04.470
with the other cluster.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.471
Breaching now.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.056
Ready the ships
to receive cargo

30:15.314 --> 30:16.982
Why keep this place
pressurized?

30:16.982 --> 30:18.609
Live soil, maybe.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.444
You might want to keep
your eyes open

30:20.444 --> 30:21.445
for prisoners in here.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.821
Hmm.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.532
I've never known Marco
to take ransoms.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.284
I maybe took one or two
in his name.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.662
Ransom's a dirty business.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.288
I don't think that's
what this is though.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.665
Why not?

30:32.665 --> 30:34.375
No food slots
in the door.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.459
This one's warm.

30:41.465 --> 30:42.675
- Ah!
Camina!

30:44.635 --> 30:45.636
You okay?

30:45.636 --> 30:47.388
Yeah.
- Okay.

30:48.556 --> 30:49.890
How many?
At least two.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.268
Behind us.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.770
- Oh, no!
Two more.

30:54.770 --> 30:55.813
Covering you.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.202
Clear.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.288
Corrido is dead.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.290
One more on Marco's ledger.

31:15.708 --> 31:19.837
Four of them. All dead.
Raiders like us.

31:19.837 --> 31:21.714
We didn't see any ships.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.632
So they are guards.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.175
Why put guards inside?

31:25.175 --> 31:27.136
A ship outside
would be better protection.

31:28.012 --> 31:29.388
You need a new helmet.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.853
They were gathering supplies.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.438
Getting ready for a pickup.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.359
Tynan, do another sweep.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.069
Is there a problem?
Scopes are clear.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.946
Check it again.
Someone is on their way.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.949
Michio, check it again.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.121
No ship on intercept,
captain.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.289
You think someone is coming.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.082
Let's not wait to meet them.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.628
All teams, take what you can,
then get back to the ships.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.212
You have one hour.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.007
-
Camina!

32:14.808 --> 32:16.727
Walker, to me!

32:16.727 --> 32:19.063
-
- What's going on?

32:19.063 --> 32:21.065
Josep is pinned.
We need a medic.

32:21.065 --> 32:23.400
Walker, we got to get
that crate off him.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.361
Don't move him,
he'll bleed out.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.529
-
- Tynan maneuvering in now.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.206
What are you doing?

32:37.206 --> 32:39.166
We're trying to get
his arm free!

32:39.166 --> 32:40.584
You'll kill him.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.087
The only thing keeping
his blood in is that pressure.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.468
I can't get it around his arm.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.474
If I can't get this on,
he will bleed out.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.142
Lift on my word.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.436
Now!

33:12.866 --> 33:14.702
- We can try again!
- No, there's no time!

33:14.702 --> 33:15.911
Hold him.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.960
Hey, I love you.
I'm so sorry.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.337
What?
What are you sorry...

33:25.337 --> 33:27.047
Oh, fucking hell.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.007
No, no, no!

33:35.347 --> 33:36.682
Pull, pull.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.773
Sturdy work, cargo.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.695
The thing
that chaps my ass

33:49.695 --> 33:51.280
is we hit a million-to-one shot

33:51.280 --> 33:53.282
coming across the Pella
in the first place,

33:53.282 --> 33:55.451
hit another million-to-one
beating three ships,

33:55.451 --> 33:57.077
and when it's time
to take the kill shot,

33:57.077 --> 34:00.289
another million-to-one
it's a dud?

34:00.289 --> 34:01.915
What are the fucking odds?

34:01.915 --> 34:05.252
Based on your numbers,
a billion-billion-to-one.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.546
I'm going to the gym.

34:19.349 --> 34:20.893
There's no point
in telling her.

34:22.519 --> 34:24.521
Don't worry about me.
I'm not gonna say anything.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.985
Amos told you
what we discussed in the hull.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.279
Didn't sound like
much of a discussion.

34:37.284 --> 34:41.246
Actually,
it's more like I told him.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.334
- He didn't mention that.
- He was trying to protect me.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.335
He does that.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.051
Do you want to know
when I realized

34:54.051 --> 34:55.052
I didn't want to kill you?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.055
Okay.

34:58.055 --> 34:59.056
It was on the Behemoth.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.517
You and Naomi
were walking unarmed

35:01.517 --> 35:06.897
into the barrels of I don't
know how many of Ashford's guns

35:06.897 --> 35:09.775
when you said that we were
all reaching for violence.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.444
Couldn't we just try
something else for once?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.532
Here we are,

35:16.532 --> 35:18.742
still trying to kill our way
to a better tomorrow.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.995
I clearly didn't make my case.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.210
I killed a lot of people.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.546
Some of them deserved it.

35:30.546 --> 35:32.047
Most of them probably didn't.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.549
That's not the point.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.678
They all haunt me
just the same.

35:41.098 --> 35:45.561
Killing someone
is a terrible thing,

35:45.561 --> 35:47.396
and you can never take it back.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.861
Don't ever feel bad
about not killing someone.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.659
That's good advice.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.369
Thank you.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.266
That's a lot of salt.

36:28.562 --> 36:29.980
I like it this way.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.450
Xidawang koyo to ke?

36:41.450 --> 36:42.743
Is this your cat?

36:44.578 --> 36:47.080
Ya.
Yes.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.958
Her name is Lucky Earther.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.502
She is fat and lazy,

36:52.502 --> 36:54.630
and I give her
whatever she wants.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.477
Beref mi ta kom ere Sirish.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.729
I was born on Ceres.

37:12.481 --> 37:13.732
Xidawang xomexownya mi.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.400
This is my home.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.694
Mi na du xase fo namang.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.112
I don't hate anyone.

37:21.698 --> 37:24.576
I want air and water
and freedom.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.289
A good life for my children.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.877
It's not the Inners
and the Belt.

37:38.382 --> 37:41.134
It's the people
who want more hate

37:41.134 --> 37:43.345
and the ones
who just want to live.

37:45.472 --> 37:50.018
I'm so tired of the hate,
just tired.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.231
I can't even wash my hands.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.277
There's no water.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.115
Lucky Earther.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.204
This makes us look weak.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.708
It makes us all look weak.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.793
That's why it works.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.628
If you want the enemy
to see you as human,

38:16.628 --> 38:18.755
you have to see them as human.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.008
I'm not sure Belters
will ever do that.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.885
I'm not sure
I'm talking about them.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.773
Hey. To me.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.316
Come here.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.902
It's okay. It's okay.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.113
It's okay.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.281
I got you.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.711
- Charges ready?
All ships standing by.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.754
Just give the word.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.840
Comms, open a channel.
Wideband.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.800
Wideband?
- Do not make me repeat myself.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.679
Walker, the word is given.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.895
This is Camina Drummer,

39:14.895 --> 39:18.940
and this message
is for the traitor, the coward,

39:18.940 --> 39:20.984
Marco Inaros.

39:20.984 --> 39:25.322
You hunted me and mine,
and still we are here, unbent,

39:25.322 --> 39:26.990
unbroken, unbowed.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.659
And you?

39:29.659 --> 39:30.952
You are nothing.

39:30.952 --> 39:34.581
Well, so much for anonymity.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.440
Come.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.694
Granicus is underway
and will rejoin us soon.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.363
Lauber's X.O.
and Weapons Officer

40:06.363 --> 40:08.031
were put outside.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.741
And did the captain
of the Granicus

40:09.741 --> 40:10.867
ask for mercy for them?

40:10.867 --> 40:12.285
He did.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.412
And he was spaced as well?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.413
No.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.462
That is insubordination.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.172
Knew you were angry
when you gave the order.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.507
I assumed you meant it
rhetorically.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.508
I didn't.

40:26.508 --> 40:27.509
Well, then consider it

40:27.509 --> 40:29.219
a happy misunderstanding.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.429
Your anger was justified,
but the punishment wasn't.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.807
It would have made you look
scared and weak.

40:33.807 --> 40:34.975
Now you look merciful.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.310
You seem to think
you have the right

40:37.310 --> 40:38.687
to speak to me this way.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.022
Somebody has to, because
all the people that used to

40:41.022 --> 40:42.774
are either dead
or sulking around below decks,

40:42.774 --> 40:44.192
picking up trash.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.361
We lost a skirmish.

40:46.361 --> 40:49.239
It would have been better
if we won, but we didn't.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.575
But if the crew thinks
you've been shaken by the loss,

40:51.575 --> 40:53.785
it will shake
their faith in you.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.371
You're Marco Inaros.

40:56.371 --> 40:59.166
Things like this roll off you.

41:04.754 --> 41:09.301
After what Filip's mother
did to me,

41:09.301 --> 41:12.470
to our family,
they deserve to die.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.431
If we succeed,

41:14.431 --> 41:16.558
they'll be as powerless
as the dead.

41:24.065 --> 41:27.652
What do you expect of victory?

41:30.447 --> 41:31.823
Governorship of Medina.

41:31.823 --> 41:36.369
Control of the crossroads
of empires?

41:38.997 --> 41:39.998
Is that all?

41:39.998 --> 41:41.666
I feel like I'm earning it.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.264
Yam Seng.

42:16.660 --> 42:17.911
Any word
on your brother?

42:19.496 --> 42:21.331
No, no. Thanks for asking.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.920
- Mind if I join you?
- Please.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.974
Weapons tech said the warhead
we found still work.

42:40.475 --> 42:43.395
We...we're putting it
in one of our own torpedoes.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.230
Free nuke, good for us.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.648
Why didn't it go off?

42:48.233 --> 42:52.112
Tech said data logs showed
torpedo disarmed before impact.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.074
You mean someone disarmed it?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.367
No, who would do that?

42:58.285 --> 43:00.745
It had to be
a malfunction in flight.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.497
We all lucky to be alive.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.212
Quick.
Put it on the screen.

43:10.755 --> 43:13.591
This is Camina Drummer,
and this message

43:13.591 --> 43:19.014
is for the traitor,
the coward, Marco Inaros.

43:19.014 --> 43:23.601
You hunted me and mine,
and still we are here.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.521
Unbent, unbroken, unbowed.

43:26.521 --> 43:28.606
And you?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.233
You are nothing.

43:30.233 --> 43:32.152
You stole from your own.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.195
You abandoned Ceres
to the Inners

43:34.195 --> 43:36.281
and left Belters to starve.

43:36.281 --> 43:39.367
You called yourself a champion,
and then you ran.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.369
So go and raise your bounties.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.496
Track me down and kill me
if you can.

43:43.496 --> 43:45.498
It doesn't matter anymore.

43:45.498 --> 43:49.836
I will always be the one
who took back what you stole.

43:49.836 --> 43:54.090
Camina Drummer did this to you.

43:54.090 --> 43:59.095
Live shamed, and die empty.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.442
At least it wasn't the Inners
who raided our supplies.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.903
- Whose side are you on?
- Well, I only meant...

44:14.903 --> 44:16.029
Drummer is our enemy.

44:16.029 --> 44:18.031
Same as the Inners

44:18.031 --> 44:20.950
and anyone else
who stands against us.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.413
This is war,
and it won't be over

44:25.413 --> 44:27.582
until we are dead
or victorious.

44:27.582 --> 44:30.335
Or else everything
that we fought for,

44:30.335 --> 44:33.213
the blood that we spilled,

44:33.213 --> 44:37.300
the beratnas we lost,
all will have been for nothing.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.886
There is no turning back now.
