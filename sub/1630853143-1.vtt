WEBVTT

00:33.533 --> 00:36.786
[Lady Whistledown]
Grosvenor Square, 1813.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.166
Dearest reader,
the time has come to place our bets

00:41.249 --> 00:43.752
for the upcoming social season.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.840
Consider the household
of the Baron Featherington.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.261
Three misses
foisted upon the marriage market

00:53.344 --> 00:54.888
like sorrowful sows

00:54.971 --> 00:56.306
by their tasteless…

00:56.389 --> 00:57.223
Tighter.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.975
…tactless mama.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.352
-Tighter!
-Is she to breathe, Mama?

01:01.436 --> 01:04.105
I was able to squeeze my waist
into the size of an orange and a half

01:04.189 --> 01:05.523
when I was Prudence's age.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.150
Your sister shall do the same.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.902
[gasps]

01:08.985 --> 01:11.654
[Lady Whistledown]
Far better odds might exist

01:11.738 --> 01:15.700
in the household
of the widowed Viscountess Bridgerton.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.871
A shockingly prolific family,

01:19.954 --> 01:23.083
noted for its bounty
of perfectly handsome sons

01:23.166 --> 01:25.585
and perfectly beautiful daughters.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.587
[groans] I am already roasting.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.380
Are you to complain
the entire day, Eloise?

01:29.464 --> 01:32.383
Surely I cannot be expected
to bear these fashions the entire day.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.677
I feel like a princess.
Do I look like one?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.888
Do you truly wish to know
what I think you look like?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.807
-On your left!
-Oh, Gregory!

01:38.890 --> 01:40.308
Is our dear sister still not ready?

01:40.391 --> 01:42.393
She's only been readying herself
the entire night.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.728
You mean her entire life.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.897
I shall run upstairs and hasten her along.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.900
-Colin, wait. I'll do it.
-She likes me better than you, Benedict.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.485
-Did she say that?
-Everyone says that.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.778
[Eloise groans]

01:52.529 --> 01:53.738
Daphne!

01:57.242 --> 01:59.369
You must make haste!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.373
Should you think she heard me?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.168
[Lady Whistledown]
How very perfect, indeed!

02:12.632 --> 02:13.466
[Hyacinth] Stop it.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.509
[sighs]

02:16.678 --> 02:18.805
[Gregory] If you don't hurry up,
we're going to be late.

02:28.022 --> 02:29.065
[indistinct chatter]

02:32.986 --> 02:34.237
[indistinct chatter continues]

02:40.660 --> 02:42.203
Any sign of him yet?

02:43.329 --> 02:44.247
[sighs]

02:47.667 --> 02:49.919
Should your brother wish
to be obeyed as Lord Bridgerton,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.629
he must act as Lord Bridgerton.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.298
Where is he, Benedict?

02:53.381 --> 02:54.465
I do not know.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.758
Hmm.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.094
[both moaning, grunting]

03:00.889 --> 03:03.016
[grunting, moaning continues]

03:56.194 --> 03:58.571
-Anthony! You are here.
-Of course I am here, Sister.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.949
I'd never miss such an important day
for you and our family.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.659
No, you would just be late for it.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.119
[exhales]

04:05.203 --> 04:06.246
Shall we?

04:12.710 --> 04:14.128
[indistinct murmuring, whispering]

04:15.338 --> 04:18.549
[Lady Whistledown]
Today is a most important day,

04:18.633 --> 04:21.135
and for some a terrifying one,

04:21.219 --> 04:22.679
for today is the day

04:22.762 --> 04:26.641
London's marriage-minded misses
are presented

04:26.724 --> 04:29.686
to Her Majesty the Queen.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.399
May God have mercy on their souls.

04:35.149 --> 04:38.069
Miss Prudence Featherington,

04:38.778 --> 04:42.115
Miss Philipa Featherington,

04:42.198 --> 04:45.410
and Miss Penelope Featherington…

04:46.577 --> 04:52.250
all presented by their mother,
the Right Honorable Lady Featherington.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.212
[attendees exclaiming, gasping]

05:07.807 --> 05:10.768
[attendees chattering indistinctly]

05:21.696 --> 05:25.450
[Lady Whistledown] It is only
the queen's eye that matters today.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.413
A glimmer of displeasure…

05:30.496 --> 05:32.248
[attendees gasp]

05:32.332 --> 05:37.378
…and a young lady's value plummets
to unthinkable depths.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.838
[indistinct murmuring]

05:41.591 --> 05:44.302
Miss Daphne Bridgerton,

05:44.802 --> 05:47.221
presented by her mother,

05:47.722 --> 05:52.226
the Right Honorable,
the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.207
Flawless, my dear.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.058
-[whispering] Did that truly just happen?
-[quietly] Keep smiling, dearest.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.351
They are watching you…

07:16.227 --> 07:17.603
now more than ever.

07:19.397 --> 07:23.276
[Lady Whistledown] But as we know,
the brighter a lady shines,

07:23.359 --> 07:25.695
the faster she may burn.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.598
[Lady Whistledown] It has been said that,

08:35.681 --> 08:38.184
"Of all bitches dead or alive,

08:38.267 --> 08:41.187
a scribbling woman is the most canine."

08:41.270 --> 08:42.146
[women gasp]

08:42.230 --> 08:43.940
If that should be true,

08:44.023 --> 08:46.776
then this author would like
to show you her teeth.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.902
[laughs]

08:49.570 --> 08:52.573
My name is Lady Whistledown.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.619
You do not know me,
and rest assured, you never shall.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.580
But be forewarned, dear reader,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.667
I certainly know you.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.090
-You absolutely sparkled, Sister.
-[both giggle]

09:09.173 --> 09:12.552
Come, now. I merely simpered and minced
in a pretty dress like everyone else.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.136
Not exactly like everyone else.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.055
Oh, I shall need to go
and visit with Penelope.

09:16.138 --> 09:19.100
Her presentation was anything but…
What was it the queen called you again?

09:19.183 --> 09:20.226
Flawless…

09:20.726 --> 09:21.978
or some such thing.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.313
Trust I was astonished
Her Majesty offered me,

09:24.397 --> 09:28.067
out of 200 young ladies present,
a most gracious remark.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.777
Yes, it was quite a distinction.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.030
And now 200 young ladies
have a common adversary.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.241
-I wish you luck, Sister.
-[Francesca] Eloise!

09:35.324 --> 09:36.409
What? It is true.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.954
My success on the marriage mart
influences all of your prospects.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.998
We will all need to find love one day.

09:42.623 --> 09:46.127
Indeed, a love as pure
as what Mama and Papa once shared,

09:46.210 --> 09:47.587
if we are so fortunate.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.882
I merely hope I am able
to continue such a grand tradition.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.217
Your dresses have arrived.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.302
[girls] Oh!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.887
[girls giggling]

09:56.971 --> 09:58.097
[Daphne] Oh!

09:58.180 --> 10:00.057
This one is quite ravishing.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.518
Mary Edgecombe wore
a similar shade last season.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.563
And secured three offers
the very next day, one from an earl.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.982
Mary Edgecombe,
now the Countess of Fulton,

10:08.065 --> 10:10.276
apparently spent the last year
living in a cottage

10:10.359 --> 10:12.111
hundreds of miles away from her earl.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.822
She is miserable. It says it all here.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.325
Do not tell me that is
yet another scandal sheet. Eloise--

10:17.408 --> 10:21.245
No, no, this one is different.
This one lists subjects by name, in full.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.789
-[gasps] Let me see!
-Wait. Wait!

10:26.584 --> 10:28.502
-"Lady Whistledown."
-"Lady Whistledown"?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.796
-[Eloise] The author.
-[Violet] Do we know a Lady Whistledown?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.007
Surely Lady Whistledown
cannot be her true name.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.217
What does it say, dearest?

10:35.301 --> 10:38.346
She loathes the fact that we've been named
alphabetically, oldest to youngest.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.891
-Your father and I found it orderly.
-Lady Whistledown finds "banality."

10:41.974 --> 10:44.518
The papers were distributed
across town today without charge.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.103
Without charge? What kind of author--

10:46.187 --> 10:47.480
[both gasp]

10:47.563 --> 10:48.898
[both chuckle]

10:49.482 --> 10:51.317
Well, at least she has one thing right.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.111
She has named Daphne
as the season's Incomparable.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.405
She calls you
a "diamond of the first water."

10:56.489 --> 10:57.948
Well, how lovely!

10:59.283 --> 11:00.117
[chuckles]

11:00.743 --> 11:02.620
[Lady Featherington]
I should not be surprised

11:02.703 --> 11:06.248
if this Whistledown is revealed
to be Violet Bridgerton herself.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.126
These pages certainly report
on the viscountess's family

11:09.210 --> 11:11.212
with much indulgence, indeed.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.173
The pages report nothing
but the truth, Lady Featherington.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.466
Daphne has bloomed exquisitely,

11:15.549 --> 11:17.927
and the sooner
she is taken from the market,

11:18.010 --> 11:19.970
the better for the other young ladies…

11:20.805 --> 11:24.392
even ones prone to hysterics
in front of the queen.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.604
Ladies, hurry with your miniatures
before our guest arrives.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.815
And, Penelope, put down that book at once.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.817
You shall confuse your thoughts.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.068
[Lady Cowper] So…

11:34.735 --> 11:36.404
tell me about this cousin.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.322
Joining you for the entire season?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.283
She is a distant cousin of my husband,

11:41.367 --> 11:44.412
and with no close female relative
to sponsor her debut,

11:44.495 --> 11:49.375
Lord Featherington has directed me
to take her in for charity.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.670
Hmm. You are known to be quite charitable.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.297
Precisely what this new rumormonger
should have published,

11:55.381 --> 11:57.341
instead of erroneously specifying

11:57.425 --> 12:00.094
that I shall only have three young ladies
under my care this year.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.011
She knows nothing.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.641
Unless you shall like to have
only three young ladies under your care.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.768
I should gladly sit this season out.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.230
Penelope is quite nervous.
This shall be her very first season.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.857
I am not nervous, Mama.

12:12.940 --> 12:15.860
What she is is two stone heavier
than she ought to be.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.863
Mm, those blemishes on her face
are quite difficult to conceal.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.073
Perhaps some arsenic and lead might help.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.742
Should you allow me to delay only a year,

12:22.825 --> 12:25.119
just as Lady Bridgerton
has done for Eloise,

12:25.202 --> 12:27.329
I may remain dedicated
to my studies, perhaps.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.456
The answer is no, Penelope.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.501
You may wish to listen to her, my lady.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.503
Shepherding four young ladies

12:34.587 --> 12:37.465
through these endless rounds of affairs
at the same time…

12:37.548 --> 12:39.467
[scoffs] Can you imagine the competition?

12:40.259 --> 12:43.554
Well, how much competition
can this cousin provoke?

12:43.637 --> 12:46.849
She came of age on a farm,
she has a mere four-figure dowry,

12:46.932 --> 12:48.267
and as for her appearance…

12:48.350 --> 12:51.604
Well, let us hope Miss Thompson
is more presentable

12:51.687 --> 12:54.565
than the legions of unkempt animals
she has spent her entire life

12:54.648 --> 12:57.151
-tending to back home. [laughs]
-Mm.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.196
Lord Featherington's cousin
has arrived, madam.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.866
[gasps] Now, remember to be kind, ladies…

13:05.326 --> 13:06.744
and charitable.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.412
The poor are our burden.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.580
[clears throat]

13:19.757 --> 13:20.633
Oh!

13:21.091 --> 13:22.259
She's beautiful.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.304
Good afternoon, Lady Featherington.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.600
[exhales deeply]

13:51.455 --> 13:54.959
Well, if this is not a sight
for my sore eyes!

13:56.669 --> 14:00.005
My condolences,
Your Grace, for your father.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.258
-Very kind of you.
-Kind of me?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.509
You hated the man.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.303
It is so wonderful
to see you, Lady Danbury.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.597
Words I do not hear often enough.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.515
Come.

14:11.058 --> 14:14.186
You must excuse the, uh, disorderliness.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.605
As you know,
I'm to host a ball this evening.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.523
Yes.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.901
I have managed to keep
the details of your return quiet.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.112
But when those vulgar mamas discover

14:23.195 --> 14:27.116
that there is an eligible duke
present at tonight's fete,

14:27.199 --> 14:30.911
I shall be able to keep such a secret
no longer.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.997
That is what I was hoping to discuss.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.708
I have only returned to London
to deal with my late father's affairs.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.544
I'm afraid
it leaves me no time to… socialize.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.380
And so, whilst I appreciate
your most gracious invitation,

14:41.463 --> 14:44.508
Lady Danbury,
I must ask you to accept my regrets.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.553
Your regrets…

14:48.095 --> 14:49.346
are denied.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.392
-I suppose a brief appearance--
-Excellent.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.729
You may leave
that flask you carry at home.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.981
Most undignified.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.277
[woman singing operatic scales]

15:14.204 --> 15:17.708
[singing continues]

15:20.252 --> 15:22.504
[both moaning, grunting]

15:22.588 --> 15:24.173
Someone may hear us, my lord.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.382
[Anthony] Mm.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.636
[moaning, grunting continues]

15:38.312 --> 15:43.108
One day, I shall seize that watch
and take it apart bit by bit.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.777
That belonged to my father.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.197
Should it disappear,
I would miss it sadly.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.699
Then you shall know
precisely how I feel…

15:51.492 --> 15:52.993
every time you disappear.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.622
Stay with me today.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.584
I'm afraid I cannot.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.252
-[groans]
-Mm.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.297
I must chaperone my sister
at the Danbury ball this evening.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.717
-Daphne, yes?
-Mm.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.427
What might they be like,

16:10.511 --> 16:13.305
these grand affairs
your sister must attend?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.265
You… would hate them.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.810
-[chuckles]
-Every eligible lady of breeding

16:17.893 --> 16:20.896
dressed in some lavishly trimmed frock,

16:21.647 --> 16:23.649
bloodthirsty mamas at their sides…

16:23.732 --> 16:24.566
[Siena chuckles]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.735
…and wary fathers making arrangements

16:26.819 --> 16:28.988
for only the most advantageous of matches.

16:29.071 --> 16:33.158
And of course, without my father here,
that responsibility… falls upon me.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.994
A significant duty, no doubt.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.997
Someone must guard my poor sister
from the bucks and pinks,

16:38.539 --> 16:41.041
ensure her virtue remains free
of any kind of defilement.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.459
Daphne is fortunate.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.337
Every woman is not afforded
such gallant protection.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.089
Every woman is not a lady.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.049
Of course not, my lord.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.177
Siena.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.640
Hey.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.143
You have me…

17:00.060 --> 17:01.520
protecting you too.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.940
I will always protect you.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.568
[Siena moans lightly]

17:13.198 --> 17:17.161
[Lady Whistledown]
The season's opening ball at Danbury House

17:17.244 --> 17:21.040
is a most highly
sought-after invitation, indeed,

17:21.123 --> 17:23.459
for every darling debutante

17:23.542 --> 17:28.547
from Park Lane to Regent Street
will be on display.

17:29.423 --> 17:33.469
[rendition of "Thank U, Next"
by Vitamin String Quartet playing]

17:36.305 --> 17:40.392
[Lady Whistledown]
Titled, chaste, and innocent,

17:40.476 --> 17:43.937
this is what they have been raised
and trained for since birth.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.108
Tonight, we shall discover

17:48.192 --> 17:51.862
which young ladies might succeed
at securing a match,

17:51.945 --> 17:57.618
thereby avoiding the dreadful,
dismal condition known as "the spinster."

17:57.701 --> 17:59.244
Oh, I do love to dance.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.081
Do you like my flower?
We grow them in our very own garden.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.667
I must show you my watercolors sometime,
if you desire to see them.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.504
And she is quite proficient
on the pianoforte too.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.813
[Lady Cowper]
Is that not the young lady

18:25.896 --> 18:27.564
who was caught
with her gentleman last year

18:27.648 --> 18:30.776
in Lady Mottram's conservatory,
unchaperoned?

18:30.859 --> 18:33.028
She's lucky her gentleman agreed
to a hasty marriage

18:33.112 --> 18:35.114
after she went and ruined herself.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.157
Lightskirts.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.367
[soft chuckle]

19:01.098 --> 19:02.432
[indistinct conversation]

19:02.516 --> 19:03.976
They're all staring, Mother.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.478
Allow them to come to you, dearest.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.485
Oh!

19:13.986 --> 19:16.697
Look who's already setting his cap
at Miss Bridgerton.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.492
Lady Bridgerton, Miss Bridgerton.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.162
Lord Bridgerton.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.999
I believe you have already been introduced
to my daughter Daphne, Lord Ambrose.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.168
Uh, yes. We met at your brother's levee.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.254
If I recall, my lord, you had just won
your first race at Newmarket.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.006
His first and only, I believe.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.592
Well, in that case,

19:36.675 --> 19:39.469
let us hope his lordship
has found himself a new horse.

19:39.553 --> 19:40.387
[chuckles]

19:40.470 --> 19:43.515
I haven't had the pleasure of seeing you
at our club lately, Ambrose.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.601
Should it have anything to do
with the unpaid balance

19:45.684 --> 19:47.352
you left on our betting books winter last?

19:53.692 --> 19:54.860
Ambrose is a cheat.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.071
A man of any honor
ensures his debts are fully paid.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.865
I did not realize…

19:59.948 --> 20:03.160
Well, how could you have done?
It is the very reason I am here, Sister.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.623
Let us take a turn about the room.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.129
[chuckles softly]

20:20.135 --> 20:21.637
He is rather pleasing.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.431
He is rather here
to shuffle about hunting fortunes.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.725
Trust Mr. Lewis knows
of your sizable dowry.

20:26.808 --> 20:27.809
Leave him be.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.230
-I presume you know of him too?
-Mr. Worthington. Second son.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.189
We shall find better.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.025
He is of dubious parentage.

20:37.027 --> 20:40.239
I shall not have you making a life
with a poet, heaven forbid.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.406
Nor an eccentric.

20:41.990 --> 20:42.950
My word!

20:44.451 --> 20:45.994
Anthony! Daph!

20:46.078 --> 20:48.789
If the only gentlemen present this evening
are your brothers,

20:48.872 --> 20:50.666
then we're in a great deal of trouble,
indeed.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.459
You continue to say "we."

20:52.542 --> 20:55.963
Did Mother tell you yet? About my tour?
I'm to begin in Greece.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.924
-Greece? How adventurous, Colin!
-On guard!

20:59.007 --> 21:00.050
[clears throat nervously]

21:00.133 --> 21:01.718
Too late.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.220
I already noted you.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.721
-Lady Danbury.
-Good evening.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.100
Miss Bridgerton,
you look rather lovely this evening.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.103
Is there a reason
I've yet to see you on the dance floor?

21:11.186 --> 21:13.230
All in good time, Lady Danbury.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.067
You poor thing.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.786
Who is that?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.373
I'm sure I've never seen her.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.876
Miss Marina Thompson,
a distant cousin of my husband's.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.962
She's rather dowdy, is she not?

21:38.755 --> 21:41.133
One of the Bridgerton boys
is joining the swarm.

21:43.969 --> 21:44.845
Well!

21:48.390 --> 21:49.433
[Lady Cowper] Most telling!

21:49.516 --> 21:53.020
I imagine your household will be
a hive of callers in the morning…

21:53.103 --> 21:54.396
Lady Featherington.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.733
Where one suitor goes,
the rest will surely follow.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.943
[Lady Cowper chuckles ironically]

22:04.740 --> 22:05.657
Excuse me.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.372
[indistinct conversation]

22:18.337 --> 22:19.421
[quietly] There.

22:20.380 --> 22:23.175
The duke. I would recognize him anywhere.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.595
-Mama, where are you taking us?
-To meet the duke.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.847
That man is not in our miniatures.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.224
Make haste
before he should see Miss Thompson.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.351
Your Grace.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.895
[girls giggling, chattering]

22:34.978 --> 22:37.481
Let me introduce my daughters,
Miss Prudence Featherington,

22:37.564 --> 22:39.941
Miss Philipa Featherington.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.028
[girls chattering excitedly]

22:52.621 --> 22:53.872
I'm quite parched.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.999
I shall fetch you
a glass of lemonade.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.835
No. You have already done
so much for me tonight.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.712
I shall return in a mere moment.

23:05.759 --> 23:06.885
Good evening.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.400
Small glasses.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.237
-Lord Berbrooke.
-Tiny little things, are they not?

23:25.904 --> 23:28.365
The glasses? I suppose.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.492
Then the matter is settled.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.037
I'm not entirely sure the matter
in which we discuss, my lord.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.040
You've always amused me, Miss Bridgerton,

23:37.124 --> 23:39.418
ever since I was a schoolboy,
and you were…

23:40.085 --> 23:42.170
All but… five?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.130
[chuckles]

23:43.964 --> 23:45.048
[slurps loudly]

23:45.340 --> 23:46.258
[exhales]

23:47.968 --> 23:49.803
My brother, he summons me.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.471
-Ah. [chuckles]
-Adieu.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.058
Miss Bridgerton?

23:56.351 --> 23:58.019
A moment, please! [chuckles]

23:59.354 --> 24:00.605
Miss Bridgerton?

24:03.692 --> 24:04.901
[Daphne] Oh!

24:06.528 --> 24:08.488
-[gasps] Pardon me.
-Forgive me.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.200
Ah, yes. Wait just one second, thank you.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.702
Tell me your name.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.204
Your name, sir?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.582
Am I honestly to believe
you do not already know my name?

24:20.208 --> 24:22.252
[low] One moment. Yes, yes. Oh, hello.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.045
[laughs boisterously]

24:24.129 --> 24:25.755
If you desired an introduction, madam,

24:25.839 --> 24:28.258
I do believe accosting me
to be the least civilized of ways.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.259
Accosting you?

24:29.342 --> 24:31.636
Truly, they will try anything.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.346
Sir, that is not…

24:33.430 --> 24:34.598
This is not…

24:35.182 --> 24:37.184
-What is your name?
-[Anthony] Basset.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.226
Basset!

24:38.310 --> 24:40.145
-Bridgerton!
-Come here, old friend!

24:40.228 --> 24:42.272
I heard news of your father.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.150
-Deuce take it, you are no longer Basset.
-I shall--

24:45.233 --> 24:48.862
Hastings! The Duke of Hastings,
now known for evermore.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.323
The Duke of Hastings, is it?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.828
-Right, Hastings, this is my sister.
-Your sister?

24:56.912 --> 25:00.040
Daphne, Hastings and I know each other
from our days at Oxford,

25:00.123 --> 25:02.250
days we shall not soon forget.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.922
Yes. As I am well aware
of the company you keep, brother,

25:07.005 --> 25:11.176
I am certain your days with His Grace
were most civilized, indeed.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.264
Hastings, we shall need
to get together properly.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.808
-I expect to see you at our club, then.
-Indeed.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.060
Evening, Bridgerton.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.062
Miss Bridgerton.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.412
Daphne, I believe
Lord Wetherby is looking for you to dance.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.581
-Is he?
-If only it weren't time for us to retire.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.084
Daphne's anything but weary.
I shall stay with her.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.086
-That would be lovely.
-Daphne…

25:46.169 --> 25:48.505
there is nary a gentleman here
who would not take your hand.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.090
You must think about this.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.593
The most perfect thing to do now
is not to dance,

25:53.677 --> 25:55.512
but to leave them all wanting more.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.722
If anyone knows how this works,

25:57.806 --> 25:59.558
it is your eldest brother.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.394
Perhaps he is right.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.271
Let us go.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.649
[scoffs softly]

26:19.077 --> 26:20.245
[door opens]

26:21.079 --> 26:22.706
Miss! You've already awakened!

26:23.832 --> 26:26.835
Have Cook prepare
as many biscuits as he can this morning.

26:26.918 --> 26:30.589
Perhaps we might move a few extra chairs
into the drawing room too.

26:31.172 --> 26:35.093
I do wonder which gentleman
will be the very first to call.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.013
I have so much to ask of them all.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.764
Well, let us get you dressed.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.104
[Daphne sighs]

26:53.945 --> 26:54.904
Anthony!

26:54.988 --> 26:57.032
I did not expect
to see you here this morning.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.117
It is terribly early for you, dearest.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.412
I could not sleep for some reason.
All the excitement, I presume.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.123
Am I the first gentleman to arrive?

27:06.374 --> 27:07.542
How wonderful!

27:07.626 --> 27:11.046
[rendition of "Girls Like You"
by Vitamin String Quartet playing]

27:14.132 --> 27:15.133
[sighs]

27:19.846 --> 27:22.891
Callers, ma'am. The Earl of Stafford
and the Marquess of Finley.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.810
My word! Well, you should have
my colorful fashions to thank.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.313
[clears throat]
For a Miss Marina Thompson.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.279
[Lady Whistledown]
Dearest reader, this author finds herself

27:36.363 --> 27:40.075
compelled to share
the most curious of news.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.369
And do you have
a large family, too, my lord?

27:42.452 --> 27:46.706
It seems our diamond
requires a closer inspection.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.917
Is there a problem, Lord Bridgerton?

27:50.877 --> 27:53.338
I should think so. You are in my seat.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.969
As such, an even rarer jewel

28:00.053 --> 28:05.934
of only the most remarkable brilliance,
fire, and luster has been unearthed.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.896
Her name, unknown to most,
yet soon known to all,

28:09.979 --> 28:12.941
is Miss Marina Thompson.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.822
Should you not be out
on your daily walk about the square, dear?

28:18.905 --> 28:20.573
It appears as though it may rain.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.284
[clears throat]

28:24.119 --> 28:29.833
This author is left to wonder
whether Her Majesty might reconsider

28:29.916 --> 28:33.044
the high praise
she once afforded Miss Bridgerton…

28:34.170 --> 28:38.758
for we all must know what
the queen despises more than anything…

28:40.260 --> 28:42.011
Being wrong.

28:43.179 --> 28:47.851
And the drawing room at Bridgerton House
currently appears to be emptier

28:47.934 --> 28:50.854
than the muddled head
of her dearest King George.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.403
Well, I must be off to my club, then.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.197
Sisters. Mother.

29:04.117 --> 29:09.372
It follows that Lady Featherington
is to receive what she has always desired:

29:09.456 --> 29:13.793
the season's true Incomparable
living under her own roof.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.962
She must be overjoyed.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.924
Is Miss Thompson so high in her instep

29:20.008 --> 29:22.260
that she's unable to don her own slippers?

29:23.553 --> 29:24.888
I should think not.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.478
Has anyone else read
what Lady Whistledown has written of late?

29:31.561 --> 29:34.397
Should anyone pay any heed
to what Lady Whistledown writes of late?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.607
I certainly do not.

29:36.107 --> 29:40.195
Mama, perhaps we might attend
the upcoming Salisbury ball by ourselves

29:40.278 --> 29:41.780
and the Merriweather tea too.

29:41.863 --> 29:46.409
I believe that Anthony has already replied
on our behalf, dearest.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.662
Apparently, he has managed
our social calendar through June.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.748
He'll be there for the entire season?

29:51.831 --> 29:54.876
Lady Whistledown has made her opinion
of our dear sister's fortunes quite clear.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.045
Oh, enough about Lady Whistledown!

30:00.757 --> 30:02.342
A caller for Miss Bridgerton.

30:02.425 --> 30:03.927
Oh! [chuckles]

30:05.178 --> 30:07.138
The Lord Berbrooke.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.269
Lord Berbrooke.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.648
Um… Uh… Come in!

30:16.731 --> 30:19.859
May I help you
to some freshly prepared biscuits?

30:19.943 --> 30:20.860
[chuckles nervously]

30:20.944 --> 30:23.196
Eloise, allow some room
for his lordship, will you?

30:24.030 --> 30:24.989
[Violet chuckles]

30:25.073 --> 30:28.159
Eloise, are you not due
for a visit with Penelope this morning?

30:28.243 --> 30:30.787
-I believe I should like to stay.
-I believe you should like to go.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.205
[Eloise groans lightly]

30:35.250 --> 30:36.334
[clears throat]

30:40.338 --> 30:41.506
[Eloise chuckles]

30:49.973 --> 30:51.683
Forgive me for not calling sooner.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.728
I presumed
your affections were already engaged.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.605
Now I know.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.608
You and I were destined for each other.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.943
[scoffing chuckle]

31:06.781 --> 31:08.491
[Lord Berbrooke crunching loudly]

31:08.783 --> 31:09.784
[inhales shakily]

31:09.868 --> 31:13.413
And so, by Heaven, your love may burn

31:13.496 --> 31:15.331
from the depths of my soul.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.625
'Tis thee I shall earn.

31:23.673 --> 31:27.302
Wonderful, wonderful.
Gentlemen, thank you for your calls.

31:27.385 --> 31:32.140
Do not forget to bid Prudence, Philipa,
or even Penelope farewell as you go.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.975
[suitors chatter indistinctly]

31:34.559 --> 31:37.186
-A most wretched sonnet, indeed.
-Lord Byron he is not.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.479
[chuckles]

31:38.563 --> 31:40.315
I do not believe so. Good day, Pen.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.823
Lord Berbrooke is harmless.
There will be others.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.578
Lady Whistledown has all
but declared me ineligible…

31:54.579 --> 31:57.248
worthy of the affection
of a detestable simpleton

31:57.332 --> 31:58.249
and no one else.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.544
Tell me, what others should ever want
such damaged goods now?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.254
[Anthony]
You speak as if Lady Whistledown

32:03.338 --> 32:06.090
were to be held in higher regard
than Her Majesty the Queen herself.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.218
You give far too much credit
to some anonymous scribbler.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.262
These musings, they're not true.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.474
Only they are true, Brother,
and they are true because of you.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.310
You have managed
to scare every worthy suitor away.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.103
Whistledown has merely reported it.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.439
I am looking out for you.
I am protecting you.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.900
-It is my duty.
-And what of my duty?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.822
You have no idea what it is to be a woman…

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
what it might feel like

32:32.867 --> 32:35.578
to have one's entire life
reduced to a single moment.

32:36.287 --> 32:38.122
This is all I have been raised for.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.458
This… is all I am.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.834
I have no other value.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.380
If I am unable to find a husband,
I shall be worthless.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.382
Daphne, you're a Bridgerton.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.592
[scoffs] It would be easier if I were not.

32:51.177 --> 32:52.428
[clicks tongue]

32:55.807 --> 32:56.724
Go on.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.563
[Lady Whistledown]
Ambitious mamas rejoice,

33:02.647 --> 33:08.569
for the new Duke of Hastings continues
to grace our fair city with his presence.

33:08.653 --> 33:12.615
And, oh,
what an impressive presence it is!

33:13.616 --> 33:16.536
Lady Whistledown has written
about you again, Your Grace.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.372
Would you like to read it?

33:19.455 --> 33:20.623
It should be noted

33:20.707 --> 33:24.752
that the duke has been overheard
announcing to mamas everywhere

33:24.836 --> 33:27.422
that he has no plans of ever marrying.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.132
This author wonders

33:29.215 --> 33:32.802
which brazen matchmaker
shall rise to such a challenge,

33:32.885 --> 33:36.139
for this competition is well underway.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.685
You know, I do suppose if it were not
for an overzealous mother at every corner,

33:40.768 --> 33:43.146
this time of year in the city
would not be so very dreadful.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.606
Those mothers simply want
the same as you, I rather think.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.317
For every last one of them
to choke on their daughters' hair ribbons?

33:48.401 --> 33:50.194
For you to claim a wife, Hastings.

33:50.903 --> 33:53.865
Are you not planning on taking your place
in society when you have a dukedom?

33:53.948 --> 33:56.576
I have a title, which, as far
as I'm concerned, will end with me.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.870
-But Hastings--
-Stop calling me that.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.748
It was my father's name. Never mine.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.584
And in any case, what of you?

34:05.293 --> 34:06.127
What of me?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.755
You are the firstborn Bridgerton
of a firstborn Bridgerton,

34:08.838 --> 34:11.716
nine times over. Where is your wife?

34:12.967 --> 34:14.093
[waiter] Right away, sir.

34:14.302 --> 34:18.473
Oh! Is your plan to fuck her forever,
your mistress?

34:19.599 --> 34:21.392
You shall need to sire an heir.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.936
I'm in possession
of something that you are not.

34:24.937 --> 34:25.980
Brothers.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.566
[Lady Whistledown]
It has reached my ears

34:28.649 --> 34:33.529
that Mr. Colin Bridgerton
shall be awarded the year's grand prize

34:33.613 --> 34:37.533
when he sweeps Miss Thompson
off her pretty little slippered feet.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.534
[Marina laughs]

34:38.618 --> 34:41.704
You could always send the willow
back to that farm, madam.

34:42.872 --> 34:45.333
As if Lord Featherington
would ever allow that.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.459
[Marina laughs]

34:49.378 --> 34:50.963
[both chuckling]

34:52.965 --> 34:54.634
[Lady Whistledown] In other news,

34:54.717 --> 34:59.347
a most peculiar suitor
for Miss Daphne Bridgerton has emerged.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.431
Daphne…

35:01.224 --> 35:03.226
[clears throat] Your caller.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.355
Will it be just the two of us…

35:07.855 --> 35:08.940
yet again?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.657
[classical ensemble playing]

35:36.759 --> 35:38.970
-Our box, Mama?
-Mm-hmm.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.012
Lady Bridgerton!

35:41.013 --> 35:42.306
Do join us.

35:49.564 --> 35:50.982
Your Majesty, good evening.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.984
You must remember my daughter, Daphne.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.026
Yes.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.404
She made quite an impression…

35:56.988 --> 35:59.365
however fleeting it may have been.
[snorting chuckle]

36:02.285 --> 36:06.080
I would like to welcome you both
to my box this evening.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.207
I insist.

36:10.042 --> 36:12.044
[overture playing]

36:15.882 --> 36:19.135
They are saying her husband will not live
till the end of the month.

36:19.218 --> 36:22.847
Surely another rumor provided
by that vicious, scandal-mongering writer.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.433
Should her degradation know no bounds?

36:25.516 --> 36:30.438
[operatic singing]

36:30.521 --> 36:32.815
Lady Whistledown writes
about my family too.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.902
Yet I suppose the duke
can withstand such scrutiny,

36:35.985 --> 36:37.612
since he is, after all, a man.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.489
His Grace was fortunate
to have you there with him as a child

36:40.573 --> 36:42.950
after what happened to his mother. Awful!

36:43.034 --> 36:45.578
-He is not what Whistledown writes.
-Nor is Daphne.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.081
It would seem the two of them
have that much in common, then.

36:49.665 --> 36:52.752
Matches have certainly been made
with far less.

36:53.794 --> 36:55.213
What are you suggesting?

36:57.048 --> 36:59.592
Lady Whistledown
merely writes what she sees.

36:59.675 --> 37:02.762
Perhaps we need to help her
to see things a bit more clearly.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.728
The duke is quite fond of gooseberry pie.

37:10.811 --> 37:13.147
The very dish my cook is renowned for.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.945
[both chuckling]

37:30.581 --> 37:31.791
[yells]

37:31.874 --> 37:36.087
[panting heavily]

37:39.674 --> 37:41.092
[women giggling]

37:41.175 --> 37:43.261
[Benedict] Haven't you heard
what we're talking about?

37:43.344 --> 37:45.429
For all we know,
Whistledown may be some interloper

37:45.513 --> 37:47.139
living in Bloomsbury, of all places.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.975
What should be
so terrible about Bloomsbury?

37:49.058 --> 37:50.935
That people there
actually work for a living?

37:51.018 --> 37:52.561
She does seem to be someone with access.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.064
-Who knows if Whistledown is even a she?
-[Anthony] Fair point.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.316
Because she is simply too good
to be anyone but a man?

37:57.400 --> 38:00.278
Well, I think it rather obvious
that the writer is Lady Danbury.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.072
Lady Danbury enjoys
sharing her insults with society directly.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.199
She would never bother herself
writing them all down.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.159
Could it be Lady Featherington?

38:07.243 --> 38:09.120
-No!
-[all laughing]

38:09.203 --> 38:10.413
[Anthony] No.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.164
You have yet to read
what Whistledown writes

38:12.248 --> 38:13.749
of the Featheringtons, little sister.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.586
You must forgive
this rather unruly debate, Your Grace.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.964
-Nonsense. I find it entertaining.
-Oh! [chuckles]

38:20.047 --> 38:23.259
All of you at one table,
even the children.

38:23.342 --> 38:28.639
Well, I realize it may be unfashionable,
but we like each other. [chuckles]

38:28.723 --> 38:30.182
Most of the time.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.268
You should join us more often,
Your Grace.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.395
Perhaps when we travel
to our country seat.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.896
You would be most welcome.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.524
[Hyacinth] Gregory!
Would you stop tossing peas at me?

38:38.607 --> 38:41.444
Those peas were already there.
You cannot tell me what to do. I am older.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.946
-And I'm taller.
-Children… [chuckles]

38:44.947 --> 38:46.782
He does have a presence about him.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.370
If rakish dukes were one's thing.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.165
-I'm to spar with Jackson himself.
-You?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.584
[Colin] Is that envy I detect
in your voice?

38:56.667 --> 38:59.420
[Benedict] Judgment, brother.
I shall need to witness this.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.088
You appear displeased.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.049
Do I?

39:03.132 --> 39:06.093
We find ourselves seated
beside each other, Miss Bridgerton.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.762
I'd like to think
you're happy about that.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.765
Perhaps, Your Grace, it would be better

39:10.848 --> 39:13.184
if you refrained
from thinking about me at all.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.020
It is simply surprising.

39:16.103 --> 39:19.982
Yes! However is it possible for a lady
to offer anything other than a smile

39:20.066 --> 39:21.233
whilst seated beside a duke?

39:21.317 --> 39:23.069
…you regarding subjects much too…

39:23.152 --> 39:25.780
-Even one of your reputation.
-You are aware of my reputation.

39:25.863 --> 39:29.575
I am aware of your friendship
with my eldest brother.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.452
If that were not enough, I am also aware

39:31.535 --> 39:34.497
of the things a certain writer
has recently written of you.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.582
Presumptuous? Clearly.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.250
Arrogant? Most definitely.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.337
You are a rake… through and through.

39:41.420 --> 39:42.588
Tell me I'm wrong.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.965
Who is to refrain
from thinking about whom again?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.885
[chuckles] I assure you.
I am anything but interested in you.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.053
-Good.
-Quite.

39:49.136 --> 39:53.224
And I anything but interested in you,
the eldest sister of my oldest friend,

39:53.307 --> 39:55.267
yet another recent subject
of a certain writer.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.812
Chaste, neat, desperate.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.524
-I shall have you know--
-To marry, that is.

40:01.607 --> 40:02.900
Tell me I am wrong.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.443
[laughs]

40:05.027 --> 40:06.070
[Eloise clears throat]

40:07.571 --> 40:11.033
Hastings, I'm so glad
you decided to join us this evening.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.119
-It was most spontaneous of you.
-Not at all.

40:13.202 --> 40:16.288
With Lady Danbury accepting
your dear mother's gracious invitation

40:16.372 --> 40:17.206
on my behalf…

40:17.790 --> 40:20.251
Well, however could I have declined?

40:20.334 --> 40:21.794
[Violet] You must stay for dessert.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.879
It's gooseberry pie, Your Grace.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.339
Ah! Lovely!

40:26.424 --> 40:27.466
[chuckles]

40:39.353 --> 40:42.064
You were a reasonable mother
until your eldest daughter came of age.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.941
-Anthony…
-This matchmaking scheme

40:44.024 --> 40:47.528
you rather transparently concocted
with Lady Danbury, it will not work.

40:48.696 --> 40:51.282
I can think of worse matches
for Daphne than a duke.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.453
-I believe the two of you to be friends.
-We are good friends.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.497
Which is why I know he has
absolutely no intention of marrying.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.458
You must understand
all men make that assertion.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.793
-Your… Your father--
-Do not bring Father into this.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.174
Even if he were in want of a wife,

41:08.257 --> 41:10.759
you would most certainly not have
the duke anywhere near Daphne.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.219
I am fully subscribed to the belief

41:12.303 --> 41:14.346
that reformed rakes make
the very best of husbands.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.514
He will not make her happy!

41:16.807 --> 41:18.142
Daphne deserves better.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.437
And I know… I know you think
you are solving the problem,

41:21.520 --> 41:22.354
but you are not.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.148
And that is all I shall say
about the matter.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.365
The duke will be joining us
as our guest at Vauxhall tomorrow evening.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.326
I admit, it was not easy
to convince him to come.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.994
-You overstep.
-She is my eldest daughter.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.497
-Yet she is my responsibility, as are you.
-Responsibility?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.749
Do not make this
any more difficult than it already is.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.459
I wish to know something, Anthony.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.753
Tonight, when you leave this study

41:45.836 --> 41:48.297
that you continue to keep
at your family home,

41:48.380 --> 41:50.966
are you to return
to bachelor lodgings across the square,

41:51.050 --> 41:54.178
or will you pay a visit
to a certain soprano that you tend to

41:54.261 --> 41:57.473
in an apartment that you pay for
on the other side of town?

41:57.556 --> 42:01.810
Relying on your younger brothers
to one day do the job that you cannot.

42:02.978 --> 42:04.897
You like to speak of responsibility.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.524
My dear son!

42:07.316 --> 42:08.150
Of duty?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.444
Pray tell, what should you know of it?

42:12.238 --> 42:14.365
I sit with her in that drawing room.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.824
Do you know what I see?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.911
A young woman who is terrified

42:18.994 --> 42:22.748
because she knows what kind of life,
what kind of future, awaits her

42:22.831 --> 42:24.959
should you continue to get in her way.

42:25.042 --> 42:26.293
[Anthony scoffs]

42:26.377 --> 42:30.005
If your father was still here,
Daphne would already have been matched.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.341
The man would have made an arrangement
with an old friend.

42:32.424 --> 42:34.802
The man would have done
what was now necessary.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.762
So you must ask yourself

42:36.845 --> 42:39.139
are you merely an older brother,

42:39.640 --> 42:41.892
or are you the man of this house?

43:07.585 --> 43:09.003
I cannot see you anymore.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.592
I… I do not understand.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.760
It is not for you to understand.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.015
I must do what is necessary.

43:23.058 --> 43:25.060
You said you would always protect me.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.482
You promised to care for me, my lord.

43:30.983 --> 43:32.151
And now…

43:33.485 --> 43:34.778
What shall I do now?

43:38.407 --> 43:39.950
You shall leave.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.953
[Lady Whistledown] Be it shame or slander,

43:43.037 --> 43:45.164
seduction or smear,

43:45.247 --> 43:46.707
there is but one thing

43:46.790 --> 43:50.836
that humbles even the most highly-regarded
members of our dear ton…

43:51.670 --> 43:52.880
a scandal!

43:56.133 --> 44:00.971
Well, dear reader, it should seem
that all of Grosvenor Square

44:01.055 --> 44:04.475
has been left to ponder
a rather scandalous question, indeed.

44:07.394 --> 44:11.690
Might one former diamond's
recent fall from grace

44:11.774 --> 44:15.277
turn out to be
the most damning scandal of all?

44:24.411 --> 44:26.038
[lively orchestra playing]

44:30.042 --> 44:30.918
Pen.

44:31.001 --> 44:32.044
Colin.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.340
-I did not know you would be here.
-Sorry to disappoint.

44:36.423 --> 44:38.550
-[chuckles]
-Have you seen Miss Thompson?

44:39.510 --> 44:41.095
She is ill.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.138
My mama had to stay home with her.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.807
Papa had to chaperone.

44:45.849 --> 44:48.018
I'm quite enjoying
the fact that he is here.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.688
Mama would never allow me
to wear a dress like this.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.857
Not, uh, yellow enough, I think.
[chuckles]

44:53.941 --> 44:54.942
Mr. Bridgerton.

44:56.026 --> 44:58.153
I believe you owe me a dance this evening.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.490
And I have only one more space
remaining on my card at present.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.283
How convenient. [gasps]

45:03.367 --> 45:06.120
-Penelope, I did not see you there.
-[Penelope gasping]

45:06.537 --> 45:08.831
I'm afraid I cannot offer you
that dance, Miss Cowper.

45:09.456 --> 45:12.543
I am to escort Miss Featherington
to the floor.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.589
[fiddle music playing]

45:28.225 --> 45:30.227
[guests laughing, cheering]

45:34.523 --> 45:38.235
[indistinct conversation]

45:38.360 --> 45:39.862
The resemblance is remarkable.

45:39.945 --> 45:41.655
You look just like him.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.823
Your father.

45:43.323 --> 45:45.117
[MC] Ladies and gentlemen,

45:45.200 --> 45:49.204
a most extraordinary event
is about to take place.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.206
Right this way!

45:51.874 --> 45:53.584
Come! Come!

46:06.597 --> 46:10.100
[humming softly]

46:15.189 --> 46:17.524
[gasps nervously]

46:24.281 --> 46:27.075
-Madam.
-Yes… Varley?

46:27.701 --> 46:29.119
[clears throat]

46:30.996 --> 46:32.706
[MC] It is with great privilege

46:32.790 --> 46:36.835
I present Vauxhall's
newest spectacle of illumination.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.670
Feast your eyes above

46:39.588 --> 46:44.384
and allow all that is radiant
to overwhelm you!

46:44.468 --> 46:45.886
[guests gasping]

46:46.762 --> 46:48.764
[guests exclaiming loudly]

46:49.348 --> 46:51.183
[MC] Wonderful light!

46:51.266 --> 46:52.434
Thank you!

46:54.478 --> 46:55.979
[guests chattering excitedly]

46:59.274 --> 47:01.777
Is it not the most bizarre?

47:01.860 --> 47:03.487
[gasps] Look, Brother.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.323
What is it?

47:06.406 --> 47:08.408
Lord Berbrooke's barony
is over 200 years old.

47:08.492 --> 47:10.494
His lineage is legitimate.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.996
He has had an excellent education,
possesses no debts,

47:13.080 --> 47:16.667
never hurt an animal or a woman,
and is even a decent shot.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.796
To speak strictly,
there is nothing wrong with him.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.632
-What should any of this--
-You are to marry him.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.261
-Nigel?
-I had to find you a husband, Sister.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.888
Now, be grateful it is done.

47:30.472 --> 47:32.975
It should be just as easy
to fall in love with Lord Berbrooke

47:33.058 --> 47:34.643
as with anyone else.

47:34.726 --> 47:37.354
I will not hear of this.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.112
[sighs]

47:58.500 --> 47:59.751
You haven't bled.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.505
It's been over a month since your arrival,

48:04.256 --> 48:05.591
and you haven't bled.

48:07.801 --> 48:08.886
[sighs]

48:10.429 --> 48:12.139
I suppose I should be happy.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.391
Up until now,

48:14.474 --> 48:17.394
I've had no legitimate excuse
to dispense with you.

48:17.477 --> 48:19.688
But when Lord Featherington hears of this,

48:20.606 --> 48:22.816
when your own papa hears of this…

48:22.900 --> 48:25.152
-Please…
-I suppose I should be happy.

48:25.235 --> 48:30.240
And if it were guaranteed
that my own ladies would not be affected

48:30.324 --> 48:33.118
by your revolting recklessness,

48:33.201 --> 48:34.286
I would be!

48:34.369 --> 48:35.787
Do you even know who the father is?

48:35.871 --> 48:38.248
What I know is
that you shall never understand.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.043
-What was that?
-You shall never understand!

48:41.710 --> 48:44.212
Someone like you,
living this ridiculously charmed…

48:45.297 --> 48:47.132
Did you think I wanted to come here…

48:48.634 --> 48:50.636
to be around people like you,

48:50.719 --> 48:52.471
so out of touch, so superior?

48:52.554 --> 48:53.555
Ah!

48:57.476 --> 48:59.686
[breathing shakily]

49:06.610 --> 49:08.028
Whatever are you doing?

49:09.529 --> 49:11.073
Nigel, not now.

49:11.156 --> 49:11.990
"Nigel?"

49:12.574 --> 49:14.534
Are we to drop the honorific so soon?

49:15.369 --> 49:17.204
I suppose as your husband--

49:17.287 --> 49:20.248
You will never be my husband.
I will never marry you.

49:21.416 --> 49:22.709
My brother, he…

49:22.793 --> 49:23.752
He made a mistake.

49:24.586 --> 49:26.588
Do you think yourself better than me?

49:28.465 --> 49:30.092
[Daphne] It'd be best for you to leave.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.635
You should be thanking me.

49:31.718 --> 49:34.846
I'm your last hope.
No one wants you, Miss Bridgerton.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.723
-[Daphne] What are you doing?
-You'll find out.

49:36.807 --> 49:37.975
[Daphne] Stop it!

49:38.058 --> 49:38.976
Let go of me!

49:40.352 --> 49:41.436
[grunts]

49:42.980 --> 49:44.272
[Berbrooke moans]

49:44.356 --> 49:45.691
[Daphne gasping]

49:45.774 --> 49:48.318
Your Grace… I had no intention--

49:48.402 --> 49:50.362
Of knocking the climp flat out?

49:51.405 --> 49:52.781
[gasps]

49:52.864 --> 49:54.449
Well, I must say, I am impressed.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.284
What are you doing out here?

49:56.368 --> 49:58.245
Avoiding certain people.

49:58.328 --> 50:00.205
-People?
-Mothers.

50:00.288 --> 50:01.957
They are people, I suppose.

50:02.582 --> 50:06.086
You are coming from the Dark Walk.
It is merely a few steps away.

50:06.169 --> 50:09.256
-What would you know of the Dark--
-The Dark Walk is merely a few steps away,

50:09.965 --> 50:11.842
and I am alone with two men.

50:11.925 --> 50:13.719
You are only with one man. The other is--

50:13.802 --> 50:15.137
I'll be compromised just the same.

50:15.220 --> 50:18.640
Do you have any idea what would happen
if someone even suggested that I--

50:19.224 --> 50:20.058
I must go.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.518
Marry me, Miss Bridgerton.

50:22.477 --> 50:25.897
Now, as far as proposals go,
that may be the least romantic of all.

50:25.981 --> 50:28.567
I suppose if someone were to find me here,

50:28.650 --> 50:30.902
it would be one way out of marrying him.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.821
You cannot possibly be thinking
of marrying him.

50:32.904 --> 50:36.616
If I am unable to secure another offer,
there may be no alternative.

50:36.700 --> 50:40.287
Unlike you, I cannot simply declare
I do not wish to marry.

50:40.954 --> 50:42.956
I do not have such a privilege.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.166
Yes, I was surprised to learn

50:44.249 --> 50:46.877
you no longer have a line of suitors
around every square in London.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.087
I am in no need of your derision, sir.

50:49.171 --> 50:51.715
I do not mock you. I am being sincere.

50:53.216 --> 50:56.053
I know
of what this Lady Whistledown has written.

50:56.136 --> 50:59.222
Trust I possess as much contempt
for the author as you do.

50:59.306 --> 51:01.808
She's all but issued a challenge
to London's most ambitious mamas,

51:01.892 --> 51:03.977
encouraging, provoking them to--

51:04.061 --> 51:05.979
Claim you as their prize?

51:06.063 --> 51:07.689
Do not worry, Your Grace.

51:08.356 --> 51:09.691
I believe such a win

51:09.775 --> 51:11.610
would be promptly forfeited, indeed.

51:11.693 --> 51:14.446
I must go this way.
You, through those trees.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.782
Perhaps there is an answer…

51:18.366 --> 51:20.827
to our collective Lady Whistledown issue.

51:26.708 --> 51:28.210
[fireworks popping loudly]

51:29.336 --> 51:30.670
[dramatic music plays]

51:41.473 --> 51:43.767
We could pretend to form an attachment.

51:49.731 --> 51:51.733
[dramatic music intensifies]

51:51.817 --> 51:53.110
[Simon] With you on my arm,

51:53.193 --> 51:55.403
the world will believe
I've finally found my duchess.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.283
Every presumptuous mother
in town will leave me alone,

52:00.367 --> 52:03.411
and every suitor will be looking at you.

52:06.289 --> 52:08.458
You must know
men are always interested in a woman

52:08.542 --> 52:10.877
when they believe another,
particularly a duke,

52:11.002 --> 52:12.003
to be interested as well.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.880
You presume Lady Whistledown--

52:13.964 --> 52:15.841
I presume she'll deem us
to be what we are.

52:15.924 --> 52:17.551
[Simon] Me, unavailable.

52:17.634 --> 52:19.177
You…

52:19.261 --> 52:20.178
desirable.

52:41.199 --> 52:42.492
Stare into my eyes.

52:48.498 --> 52:49.332
Here.

52:50.667 --> 52:51.501
Closer.

52:54.462 --> 52:58.341
If this is to work,
we must appear madly in love.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.802
-It is an absurd plan.
-I find it quite brilliant.

53:00.886 --> 53:03.138
Provided you do not wish to marry me,

53:03.221 --> 53:05.098
and I do not wish to marry you,

53:05.182 --> 53:07.058
whatever should you have to lose?

53:23.325 --> 53:25.327
[dramatic music escalates]

53:47.098 --> 53:49.142
[Lady Whistledown]
For those not in attendance

53:49.226 --> 53:50.977
at the Vauxhall celebration,

53:51.061 --> 53:55.023
you missed
the most remarkable coup of the season.

53:55.607 --> 54:00.070
It appears Miss Daphne Bridgerton
has captured the interest

54:00.153 --> 54:03.240
of the newly returned Duke of Hastings.

54:05.951 --> 54:08.954
How the young miss secured
her newfound suitor

54:09.037 --> 54:11.373
is yet to be determined.

54:12.415 --> 54:16.753
Yet, if anyone shall reveal
the circumstances of this match,

54:16.836 --> 54:18.171
it is I.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.965
Yours truly…

54:21.007 --> 54:22.550
Lady Whistledown.

54:22.634 --> 54:27.055
[dramatic music crescendos]
