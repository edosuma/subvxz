or the feeling

10:27.278 --> 10:29.193
belongs to her
and that it was stolen.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.804
- Stolen, stolen!

10:30.847 --> 10:33.241
[speaking in Burmese]

10:33.284 --> 10:36.113
- Okay.
Calm--calm down, please.

10:36.157 --> 10:39.116
- Clear this up. Now.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.424
- All right. Come on, people.
Let's go.

10:42.467 --> 10:46.820
- How's this for our brand?

10:50.780 --> 10:51.912
That was...

10:51.955 --> 10:54.262
- 1974.

10:54.305 --> 10:57.395
- Soldiers retaliated.
She lost her family.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.570
She lost everything.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.053
- Lost that too.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.450
- Till today I had never heard
her speak about that time.

11:08.493 --> 11:12.715
- Ms. Takhon,
I...can only imagine

11:12.759 --> 11:14.630
how traumatizing
that must have been.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.764
- I mean, I'd never heard
her talk about the happy times.

11:17.807 --> 11:20.941
In order to start a life here,
she had to forget.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.509
But that song today
she told me her mom played it

11:24.553 --> 11:25.815
and her family sang to it.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.992
It's hers, and she deserves
to have it back.

11:29.036 --> 11:35.042
- Look--I--you seem very,
very sincere,

11:35.085 --> 11:38.088
but the odds
that this is actually her harp,

11:38.132 --> 11:40.003
I mean, it's been 50 years.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.657
I'm so sorry.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.705
This just doesn't
prove anything.

11:45.748 --> 11:49.970
- Well, there's an inscription
inside this harp.

11:50.013 --> 11:53.103
Can you ask your grandmother
if she knows it?

12:12.862 --> 12:18.650
- Sandar 81830.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.741
My mother's name
and her birthday.

12:23.655 --> 12:27.485
- It is hers.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.889
- Got your 911.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.065
Why aren't you prepping
for the artificial heart?

12:42.109 --> 12:45.721
- Because your husband
pulled me off of it.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.550
He knows, Lyn.
He knows about us.

12:48.593 --> 12:49.769
- That's impossible.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.509
- He took me off the surgery
of my life,

12:51.553 --> 12:53.685
and he did it with no reason.
What's your explanation?

12:53.729 --> 12:57.733
- There's no way.

12:57.777 --> 13:04.044
At breakfast he--
he was a little distant.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.089
That's not how
I wanted this to go down.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.874
- I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.353
I mean, all this talk about

13:09.397 --> 13:11.486
how evolved to have such a
mature relationship, it's...

13:11.529 --> 13:13.575
[pager beeps]

13:13.618 --> 13:15.707
It's wishful thinking.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.144
Of course he feels attacked.

13:17.187 --> 13:20.800
Of course he's lashing out.
What were we thinking?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.714
- We didn't do anything wrong.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.413
Claude and I, we have rules.
We didn't break them.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.198
- Those rules are
who we wish we were.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.679
Here in real life your husband
undermined my career,

13:30.722 --> 13:32.115
and he did it
with the snap of his fingers.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.162
What's he going to do next?

13:36.946 --> 13:39.079
- Book a CT.
I didn't like the bloodwork.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.950
- Poor guy's had a lot
of tests.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.213
- Or you could skip
the commentary and just do it.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.825
- Uh, rude.
- I'm sorry.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.130
I'm having a morning.
It's like--

13:47.174 --> 13:48.784
- Thank you so much.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.612
I can't thank you enough.
I--I don't usually...

13:50.655 --> 13:54.007
- You're kidding.
- Traffic in public hospitals.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.620
- Jeanie Bloom.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.623
- Oh, the world's
sexiest nurse.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.103
Come here, baby.
Give some love.

14:03.146 --> 14:07.629
- No, I told you to go.
- Yes, and I found a doctor

14:07.672 --> 14:11.633
who doesn't kick women
in pain to the curb.

14:11.676 --> 14:17.508
- A word?

14:19.162 --> 14:21.512
You realize she's
just using you for pills?

14:21.556 --> 14:24.080
- Maybe.
- Maybe. She is high right now.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.908
- Which is why I admitted her.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.128
As long as she's intoxicated,
a clean diagnosis

14:28.171 --> 14:30.870
is impossible.
I'm ordering a rapid detox

14:30.913 --> 14:32.654
so I can make
an informed decision.

14:32.697 --> 14:33.742
- Oh, God. Oh.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.919
[groans]

14:36.963 --> 14:38.921
- Okay, fine. Treat her.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.749
She's just going to
use you for pills.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.883
She's going to say whatever
she has to say to get her fix.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.580
- Or maybe we'll discover
the source

14:45.623 --> 14:49.714
of the underlying pain.
- Yeah, sure. Good luck.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.066
- We're giving it back.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.764
- Max, it is not ours
to give back.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.244
It belongs to the Manhattan.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.681
- Yeah, just like the lobby
belongs to this hospital?

14:59.724 --> 15:01.639
- Oh, you are really hung up
on the lobby.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.119
- This isn't about me.
This is about him,

15:03.163 --> 15:04.904
and it's going to be about you.
If this gets out,

15:04.947 --> 15:06.731
how do you think the board
is gonna feel when they hear

15:06.775 --> 15:08.603
that your first act
as medical director

15:08.646 --> 15:11.649
was to make New Amsterdam the
face of someone else's scandal?

15:11.693 --> 15:13.129
- I will tell the board

15:13.173 --> 15:14.914
that there are worse things
than taking a PR bullet

15:14.957 --> 15:16.698
for a very rich museum.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.657
And when we get a Manhattan
Museum of art fundraiser

15:19.701 --> 15:22.965
do you honestly think that
they will care about a harp?

15:23.009 --> 15:24.662
- This isn't just about a harp.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.665
It's about a patient who
endured a lifetime of suffering

15:27.709 --> 15:29.972
and had to live it
all over again because of us.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.888
So screw the board;
screw the games.

15:32.932 --> 15:37.632
She's in pain,
and we can fix it.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.764
- That's not my job.

15:40.983 --> 15:47.120
I'm sorry, Max. The harp stays.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.818
- What is
the Shopping Mall Experiment?

15:49.861 --> 15:51.733
- That is a very famous
experiment

15:51.776 --> 15:53.082
regarding the nature of memory.

15:53.126 --> 15:55.041
A group of doctors
tried to convince a group

15:55.084 --> 15:56.912
of healthy minded adults

15:56.956 --> 15:58.609
that they had suffered
an incident as children

15:58.653 --> 16:00.002
where they were lost in a mall.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.613
- And did they succeed?
- They did.

16:02.657 --> 16:05.051
Almost half of the participants
were so sure

16:05.094 --> 16:07.705
that it actually happened
that when the doctors revealed

16:07.749 --> 16:09.969
they made it up
they refused to believe them.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.972
- So people can have memories
that feel true

16:13.015 --> 16:14.060
but are pure fiction?

16:14.103 --> 16:17.019
- So imagine I showed you
a chair

16:17.063 --> 16:18.238
and then I took the chair away
and asked you

16:18.281 --> 16:20.936
to draw a picture of it.
That is memory.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.678
That is our brains attempt
in the moment

16:23.721 --> 16:26.811
to recreate the past.
If I asked you

16:26.855 --> 16:28.726
to draw that chair tomorrow it
would probably be pretty good,

16:28.770 --> 16:34.819
but if I asked you to draw it
again in a year, not so much.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.997
- And recovered memories
like the plaintiffs?

16:45.091 --> 16:46.962
- Recovered memories would be
like asking your brain

16:47.006 --> 16:48.268
to draw a picture of a chair

16:48.311 --> 16:50.879
it hadn't thought
about in 20 years.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.012
- Is it fair to say
that recovered memories

16:53.055 --> 16:54.796
are inherently unreliable?

16:54.839 --> 16:55.971
- Yes.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.277
- Would you send someone
to jail

16:57.320 --> 16:59.888
based solely
on a recovered memory?

17:05.981 --> 17:07.200
- No, absolutely not.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.430
- Oh, hey, Dr. Reynolds.
- Hi.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.780
I need you to instruct
Dr. Baptiste to reinstate me

17:22.824 --> 17:24.565
on the artificial
heart implant.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.176
Now, I'd go to him directly,
but given the effort

17:27.220 --> 17:29.613
you exerted in bringing such
a momentous surgery here,

17:29.657 --> 17:32.442
I figured you'd really
understand the stakes.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.097
- Oh, Dr. Baptiste didn't
take you off that surgery.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.577
I did.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.362
- I--you?
- Mm-hmm.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.799
- Wait, what? Why?

17:41.843 --> 17:44.280
- Well, you have a patient
that takes precedent.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.804
Erma Mirojnik?
- Erma--Erma--no, no, no, no.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.937
I treated her already
this morning.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.157
- Oh, we have a new policy.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.811
The discharging physician
handles follow-ups if a patient

17:53.855 --> 17:56.249
returns to the hospital
within 30 days of treatment.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.817
And unfortunately, Ms. Mirojnik
returned within 13 minutes.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.384
- She what?

18:01.428 --> 18:02.951
- Mm, she's here now.
She's awaiting treatment.

18:02.994 --> 18:08.652
And you'd know that
if you answered your pages.

18:08.696 --> 18:13.353
Dr. Reynolds, do you have
a problem with this policy?

18:13.396 --> 18:14.745
- I have a problem
with you risking

18:14.789 --> 18:16.399
a history-making surgery
so I can treat

18:16.443 --> 18:17.922
Erma Mirojnik's paper cuts.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.751
- Come on. The surgery is just
a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.536
And I think history
will manage just fine

18:22.579 --> 18:25.495
if someone other than you
is holding the scissors.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.931
- I earned this opportunity.

18:30.848 --> 18:36.376
- Um, no, Dr. Reynolds,
you earned Erma Mirojnik.

18:36.419 --> 18:39.422
Now, if you can treat
Ms. Mirojnik's issues,

18:39.466 --> 18:44.819
in time you can certainly still
scrub in on the surgery, okay?

18:49.432 --> 18:52.000
- Hayma Takhon's prosthesis
doesn't fit her properly.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.523
It's tearing into her skin.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.439
She's battling constant pain,
infection--

18:56.483 --> 18:58.746
- Dr. Goodwin--
- That's not the half of it.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.835
This is her first
revision surgery with us,

19:00.878 --> 19:03.707
but it's her fourth
in the last decade.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.406
Insurance won't pay for a
better limb, so every time

19:06.449 --> 19:07.972
she gets a new surgery

19:08.016 --> 19:11.933
she knows that it's not
if she'll be back it's when.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.544
It's torture.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.893
- She has my sympathies

19:15.937 --> 19:18.592
and those of
the entire Manhattan Museum,

19:18.635 --> 19:20.898
but we have
the saung-gauk's provenance.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.858
We have strict protocols
to avoid cultural looting.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.381
Our hands are clean.

19:25.425 --> 19:28.906
- Fair enough.
I'll tell Hayma what you said.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.734
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.910
And then I'll tell her to call
the arts task at "The Times"

19:32.954 --> 19:34.651
just to see if they think
your protocols

19:34.695 --> 19:36.436
are as strict
as they need to be.

19:40.918 --> 19:45.401
- If we let this woman do this
dozens of others with similar

19:45.445 --> 19:47.838
pending claims
are going to demand the same.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.536
- You're right.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.974
If only there was some way to
magically make it all go away,

19:53.017 --> 19:54.584
skip the legal PR fiasco,

19:54.628 --> 19:58.458
then you'd probably
give it back in a heartbeat.

19:58.501 --> 20:02.418
- Of course.
- Maybe this will help.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.769
It's an NDA signed by Hayma
guaranteeing her silence

20:05.813 --> 20:08.772
in exchange for the saung-gauk.

20:08.816 --> 20:11.079
No legal battle, no PR.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.952
And you, you get to do
the right thing.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.525
- Very well.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.548
- [clears throat]

20:45.592 --> 20:48.769
[sighs]

20:48.812 --> 20:50.379
Helen, before I walked
into that courtroom,

20:50.423 --> 20:53.948
I had no idea you were
on the other side of that case.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.689
- Did you not hear?

20:55.732 --> 20:59.606
There is no case.
The state dropped the charges.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.043
Thanks to your testimony,
a monster's gonna walk.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.611
- I'm sorry to hear that.

21:04.654 --> 21:07.831
- You're sorry.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.572
Great.
Well, I'll just be off then.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.531
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to tell me

21:11.574 --> 21:12.880
why you would stand up in court

21:12.923 --> 21:14.795
and attack
a victim of sexual violence?

21:14.838 --> 21:17.537
- I didn't.
I did not attack a victim.

21:17.580 --> 21:20.453
I've never even met the victim.
You can't possibly think

21:20.496 --> 21:23.499
that I have some sort
of anti-victim agenda here.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.979
I don't.
- How distressing it must be

21:25.022 --> 21:26.546
for you not to be believed.

21:30.550 --> 21:34.380
- I gave scientific testimony
that recovered memories

21:34.423 --> 21:35.903
are unreliable, which they are.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.035
I've been practicing
for many years, Helen.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.689
And I've yet
to encounter anyone

21:39.733 --> 21:41.865
who had a recovered memory
that was the unqualified truth.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.564
- How about me?

21:44.607 --> 21:47.523
Back in university, I got
caught in a summer rainstorm,

21:47.567 --> 21:49.177
and this memory out of nowhere
came up

21:49.220 --> 21:50.918
and hit me like a hammer.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.615
It's the strongest memory
I have.

21:52.659 --> 21:53.921
[thunder booming]

21:53.964 --> 21:58.142
<i>A summer rainstorm.
August Bank Holiday. </i>

21:58.186 --> 22:02.799
<i>I'm five, and I'm playing
this beaded string </i>

22:02.843 --> 22:04.584
<i>that I'd just gotten
for my birthday. </i>

22:04.627 --> 22:06.542
[indistinct chatter]

22:06.586 --> 22:08.152
<i>But really, I'm listening.</i>

22:08.196 --> 22:11.112
- Let go of me.
- Wait, we can work--

22:11.155 --> 22:13.897
- Stop crying.
Don't touch me.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.074
<i>- 'Cause that's the day
my dad left. </i>

22:17.118 --> 22:20.164
- Hold on, don't leave. Please.
Please, please, stop.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.905
- Don't touch me.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.386
- I'm so sorry.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.563
I love you.
I love you. I'm so sorry.

22:27.607 --> 22:31.915
<i>- And right when he reached
the door I begged him to stay, </i>

22:31.959 --> 22:35.789
<i>but he just pushed me off,
and my beads ripped. </i>

22:47.017 --> 22:48.497
Now look me in the eye
and tell me

22:48.541 --> 22:50.543
that my memory is not critical

22:54.068 --> 22:56.810
- In a court of law, it's not.

23:01.815 --> 23:04.774
- It's a good thing that you're
not seeing patients anymore

23:04.818 --> 23:06.733
'cause I would tell any woman
who came through your door

23:06.776 --> 23:08.778
to run as fast as she could.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.611
- I mean that is bad.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.745
How come
no one could see that before?

23:18.788 --> 23:21.443
- I said you could treat her,
not prescribe her pills.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.837
- Excuse me.
I'm talking to my doctor here.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.143
- No, you're not.
You're discharged.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.623
Don't let the door hit you.
- Ow. Ow.

23:27.667 --> 23:28.972
You can't just do that.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.974
She's treating me.
I'm her patient.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.281
- No, you're a pill head
gaming us for a fix,

23:33.324 --> 23:36.632
and I toss those out of here
all the time.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.155
I also toss out doctors who

23:38.199 --> 23:40.593
hand out schedule two narcotics
to known drug addicts.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.072
- I didn't give her pills.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.074
I ordered them
to help her calm down

23:44.118 --> 23:46.076
so I could perform
the ultrasound,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.078
which revealed Lyme disease.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.080
Look at the ultrasound.
You'll clearly see--

23:50.124 --> 23:51.821
- An enlarged spleen, right?

23:51.865 --> 23:55.085
And I bet Jeanie was just so
grateful when you spotted it.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.826
But Jeannie knows she has
an enlarged spleen,

23:56.870 --> 23:59.829
because genie
is a hard-core alcoholic.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.657
She played you.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.051
Oh, by the way, I canceled
Leyla's prescription.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.531
Go score somewhere else.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.881
- What kind of daughter
treats her mother like this?

24:11.885 --> 24:13.190
- I tell you what.

24:13.234 --> 24:16.585
You start acting like a mom,
then we can talk.

24:16.629 --> 24:19.066
- Really? And how many times
were you here

24:19.109 --> 24:23.331
at work stoned off your ass
on Adderall?

24:23.374 --> 24:24.811
Oh, does she know
about that?

24:24.854 --> 24:26.726
- She does, because I am
working my program.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.031
I tell her the truth.

24:28.075 --> 24:31.644
- Oh, so you and she are...

24:31.687 --> 24:33.559
it's not gonna
make a difference.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.825
Honey, thank you so much.

24:38.868 --> 24:41.523
It was very nice to meet you.
You have been so sweet.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.178
You--you're gonna be over her
by Christmastime.

24:44.221 --> 24:47.224
I--I don't know. She's just
nasty inside. She's cold.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.270
I guess you're just next
in line to figure that out.

24:49.313 --> 24:53.230
- Get out of my ED now!

24:55.102 --> 24:59.236
- Oh, okay. Ohh.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.586
[groans]

25:00.629 --> 25:04.111
- You know what, Mom?
You know what?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.767
Here are your pills.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.986
Take 'em with vodka;
have a party.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.945
Why should I care?

25:19.561 --> 25:19.692
.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.346
- Max, what the hell
did you do?

25:22.390 --> 25:25.262
- Oh, I brokered a deal between
the Manhattan and Hayma.

25:25.306 --> 25:28.178
- Well, that deal is currently
blowing up in our lobby.

25:29.571 --> 25:32.139
- [speaking in Burmese]

25:32.182 --> 25:34.358
- [speaking in Burmese]

25:34.402 --> 25:35.708
- It never even belonged
to you.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.579
- Hey, hey, hey, put that down.
We had a deal.

25:37.623 --> 25:38.580
- This man--

25:38.624 --> 25:39.712
- I'm from the
Myanmar Consulate.

25:39.755 --> 25:40.800
- Oh he's a thief.
- Okay.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.366
- [speaking Burmese]

25:42.410 --> 25:45.544
- Sir, we had an agreement.
The Manhattan Museum of Art

25:45.587 --> 25:48.721
has agreed to return
the saung-gauk to Miss Takhon.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.287
- We are aware.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.246
When a museum repatriates
an item from our country,

25:52.289 --> 25:53.595
they are obliged
to let us know.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.249
- Okay, great. You know.
So what's the issue?

25:55.292 --> 25:56.772
- He's about to take back
the saung-gauk.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.165
- Okay. Okay.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.601
Let's all just take
a deep breath.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.124
I'm sure that we can
all work this out.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.648
- There's nothing to work out.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.432
The country that stole Hayma's
instrument 50 years ago

26:04.475 --> 26:06.477
is back to do it again.
We can prove

26:06.521 --> 26:10.133
that this saung-gauk
belongs to Ms. Takhon.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.570
- There are many objects
in museums

26:11.613 --> 26:13.310
that may belong to Myanmar.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.617
Mr. Gong has proven
that this one did.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.445
And when she left our country,
it became property

26:17.488 --> 26:19.752
of the state.
She abandoned it.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.450
- Abandoned?
She was driven out at gunpoint.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.147
- Max.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.715
- Look, the state department
has already signed off.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.413
I have sent you the paperwork.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.638
- No--no, wait, wait, sir.

26:36.682 --> 26:40.816
Please don't do this
to her again.

26:43.384 --> 26:46.517
- Just because you can't see
the gun pointed at me

26:46.561 --> 26:48.389
doesn't mean it isn't there.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.179
<i>- Triage nurse to the ER.</i>

26:56.223 --> 26:57.485
<i>Triage nurse to the ER.</i>

27:00.401 --> 27:02.316
- You have large
inflamed adenoids

27:02.359 --> 27:04.666
in the back of your sinuses.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.320
- Good heavens.

27:06.363 --> 27:09.192
- It's actually good news.
Simple surgery is all you need.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.846
- So you can fix it?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.805
- Yes but, Erma, your adenoids
didn't get this big overnight.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.677
I mean, you must've had a clue
that things weren't right,

27:15.721 --> 27:19.899
I mean, from snoring, aching
sinuses, cough, something.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.249
- Yes, all of that.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.642
- Well,
why didn't you mention it?

27:23.685 --> 27:26.819
I mean, we certainly see
each other often enough.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.691
- Well, I--I didn't
want to be an old pest.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.650
I mean, I know you have
more important things

27:31.693 --> 27:33.390
to do than to take care of me.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.566
You've already looked
at the clock five times

27:35.610 --> 27:41.355
since you came in here.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.357
- You're right. I'm sorry.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.838
I--

27:45.881 --> 27:47.666
I never meant
to make you feel...

27:48.623 --> 27:51.539
- Hey.
- One moment.

27:53.584 --> 27:57.806
- Surgery's about to start.
I got this. Go make history.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.558
- Erma, Dr. Flores
has got it from here.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.649
You're in good hands.
Thank you.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.523
- Hi. How are you?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.308
- Hi.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.571
- Let's see what we got here.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.317
- Don't worry about it.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.320
You're in good company.
She's fooled a lot of

28:33.363 --> 28:35.714
A-list doctors.
I shouldn't have left you to--

28:35.757 --> 28:39.979
- You never looked
at the ultrasound.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.459
- Okay.
You know, I find your refusal

28:42.503 --> 28:45.593
to admit your wrong attractive,
but come on.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.900
- You're giving substandard
level of care.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.292
- I get
that you're embarrassed,

28:49.336 --> 28:51.773
but you are
way out of line.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.296
That was awful in there,

28:53.340 --> 28:55.255
and you haven't
even asked me if I'm okay.

28:55.298 --> 28:59.302
- Because when I'm on duty
my concern is for the patient.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.304
And if you were being
her doctor instead of her kid,

29:01.348 --> 29:03.611
you wouldn't be asking me
to tend to your feelings.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.874
You'd be looking
at the ultrasound.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.663
The spleen is
enlarged from alcohol,

29:12.707 --> 29:13.795
but I see a level of growth

29:13.839 --> 29:15.014
that
may indicate other factors.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.363
- Except it doesn't.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.494
- You barely looked.

29:17.538 --> 29:18.931
- Because I have seen my mom's

29:18.974 --> 29:20.933
spleen as much as
I've seen her face, okay?

29:20.976 --> 29:24.458
It's exactly the same. It's...

29:29.506 --> 29:32.814
- What?

29:32.858 --> 29:35.817
- Above the spleen.

29:35.861 --> 29:39.952
Cysts.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.476
- Endometriosis.

29:46.741 --> 29:51.659
- She was telling the truth.

29:54.705 --> 29:57.839
- Come in.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.842
- Hi. Can we talk?

30:06.761 --> 30:08.807
Okay, well, I think that we
need to have a talk.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.331
- Well, I don't have
anything to say.

30:15.857 --> 30:20.949
- It wasn't raining that day
when your dad left.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.909
You told me you were five.
I looked it up,

30:23.952 --> 30:25.562
August Bank Holiday
of that year.

30:25.606 --> 30:27.738
There was a heat wave.

30:27.782 --> 30:30.045
Meteorologically historic there
wasn't a drop of rain in London

30:30.089 --> 30:31.568
that entire summer.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.049
- Is that supposed to shake me
to my core?

30:34.093 --> 30:36.530
'Cause I'm pretty sure
you could find another website

30:36.573 --> 30:40.012
that says it hailed frogs.
It rained. I was there.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.579
- Unless it wasn't London.
- It was London.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.713
- Really? Most people travel
on August Bank Holiday.

30:45.756 --> 30:48.890
You told me yourself that you
took many trips to the seaside.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.892
I've heard you talk about it.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.721
[seagulls squawking]

30:55.592 --> 30:58.508
- Fine. Maybe it was Cornwell.
Well spotted.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.859
- Except for the heat wave
wasn't just in London

31:00.902 --> 31:02.382
that summer.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.950
The entire country
didn't get a drop of rain.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.560
Do you know
where it was raining?

31:06.603 --> 31:07.909
- It was raining.
- Yes.

31:07.953 --> 31:10.477
You were in a summer storm
when you had the memory.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.653
Maybe the two
have been conflated.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.047
[birds chirping]

31:20.139 --> 31:22.924
And if you're wrong
about the rain

31:22.968 --> 31:25.013
and you're wrong
about the location...

31:25.057 --> 31:27.929
- How dare you?
How dare you come in here

31:27.973 --> 31:29.975
and try and disrupt
what I know to be true?

31:30.018 --> 31:31.541
- But you don't.
- Pardon?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.152
- But you don't know,
and I don't know.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.549
You know that I hated
what I did today, don't you?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.943
I--I hate that part of my job.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.815
Sexual assault victims
are almost always

31:44.859 --> 31:46.948
telling the truth,
and they deserve respect

31:46.992 --> 31:49.690
and sympathy
and above all else belief.

31:49.733 --> 31:53.607
But recovered memories
are not valid. That is a fact.

31:53.650 --> 31:55.043
Not yours, not hers,
not anyone's,

31:55.087 --> 31:56.610
and I'm not going
to lie under oath

31:56.653 --> 31:58.786
because I think somebody
is probably guilty.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.440
I am not playing God.

32:00.483 --> 32:04.052
- No, just executioner.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.575
- How did
the beads rip, Helen?

32:05.619 --> 32:07.142
- Can you get out, please?
This is so sick.

32:07.186 --> 32:10.058
- I will. I will. Just tell me
how the beads got ripped.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.104
- I already told you
my father pushed me.

32:12.147 --> 32:15.455
- He pushed you?
That doesn't make sense.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.937
How does the string of beads
get ripped for a push?

32:18.980 --> 32:20.068
- Well, that's what
happened so--

32:20.112 --> 32:21.635
- No, it doesn't.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.115
A string of beads does not
get ripped from a push.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.594
- You don't know that!
You don't know that!

32:24.638 --> 32:26.509
- For that you need a pull.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.904
Stop.
- She's my daughter.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.775
I can't leave.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.822
- We're done.
- No, I...

32:34.865 --> 32:36.215
I don't want to go.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.524
Don't, no, don't--
- Let go.

32:41.568 --> 32:45.964
[beads rattling]

32:46.007 --> 32:48.140
Get out! Go!

32:56.148 --> 32:58.628
- Helen.

32:58.672 --> 33:02.154
- My--my mother
broke the beads.

33:16.081 --> 33:19.258
- The retractor
has been removed.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.303
- Vitals are steady.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.392
- [indistinct].

33:23.436 --> 33:26.308
- Hmm. That looks much better.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.050
- We thought we weren't going
to get to see you for this one.

33:29.094 --> 33:33.402
- Nope. This was too important.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.492
[heart monitor beeping]

33:51.681 --> 33:55.163
- I'm sorry.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.035
I'm sorry
about your saung-gauk.

33:58.384 --> 34:02.214
If you want our legal services,
we'll fight it.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.694
Won't cost you a cent.

34:06.174 --> 34:10.048
- [speaking in Burmese]

34:15.183 --> 34:19.492
- The past is gone.
Nothing can bring it back.

34:19.535 --> 34:22.147
Not even the saung-gauk.

34:22.190 --> 34:26.716
Only thing is to live for now.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.068
[speaking in Burmese]

34:32.418 --> 34:35.073
- Maybe we can help with that.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.813
Are you enjoying
the prosthesis?

34:36.857 --> 34:40.556
It's the best one we've got.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.168
- I don't know why you would
get her hopes up like that

34:43.211 --> 34:45.344
when you know her insurance
would never pay for it.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.128
- No, no, you're right.
They wouldn't.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.218
But, Ms. Takhon,
to make up for their part

34:50.262 --> 34:52.220
in the acquisition
of stolen property,

34:52.264 --> 34:55.528
the Manhattan Museum of Art
has offered to buy you

34:55.571 --> 34:57.269
the prosthetic leg
of your choosing.

34:57.312 --> 35:00.141
And may I suggest the one you
have on, which should guarantee

35:00.185 --> 35:03.579
that you'd never have
to have revision surgery again.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.801
She understood all of that?

35:07.844 --> 35:12.458
- She got enough.
- Good.

35:12.501 --> 35:17.376
- So Flores got to do
the artificial heart surgery?

35:17.419 --> 35:22.381
- Mm-hmm. She did.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.688
- You were looking forward
to that one.

35:25.732 --> 35:29.127
- I was.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.564
Oh,
probably for the wrong reasons.

35:31.607 --> 35:36.395
- Yeah, but the first
Black surgeon

35:36.438 --> 35:42.357
to perform
an artificial heart transplant.

35:42.401 --> 35:47.275
- That would've been cool.

35:47.319 --> 35:50.800
- Instead,
you put your patient first.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.806
That's kind of cool too.

36:02.290 --> 36:07.600
- Makes me think I should do
that more often

36:07.643 --> 36:09.776
with the people
I care about the most.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.827
It's time to tell your husband.

36:22.310 --> 36:25.444
- Endometriosis is difficult
to diagnose.

36:25.487 --> 36:28.273
I mean,
there's no one clear test.

36:28.316 --> 36:33.800
And there's no easy fix.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.542
Hey. Hey, come on. It's okay.
We're going to get there.

36:36.585 --> 36:43.288
- 30 years no one's
ever believed me.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.899
They said,
"Oh, it's your period."

36:45.942 --> 36:47.640
They said, "You're crazy."

36:47.683 --> 36:48.771
- They said you wanted pills.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.475
I've judged you my whole life.

36:56.518 --> 37:00.392
I mean,
I've thought awful things.

37:00.435 --> 37:03.917
But you were in pain,
and you needed my help.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.658
And I am a doctor.

37:05.701 --> 37:06.876
I'm your daughter.

37:06.920 --> 37:13.274
I--I should have--

37:13.318 --> 37:16.712
I am just really sorry, Mom.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.508
- Yeah, come in.

37:34.643 --> 37:38.299
I--I was just
leaving you a voice mail.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.910
You know how you can delete
and, like, start over again?

37:40.954 --> 37:42.738
And I just kept deleting,

37:42.782 --> 37:48.570
and I got caught
in a loop of stupidity.

37:48.614 --> 37:54.010
I--I hate that I did that
to you.

37:56.752 --> 38:01.017
- And I hated you for doing it.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.411
It was violating.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.415
But you were right.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.553
I'm about to cross an ocean
to be closer to my mum,

38:14.596 --> 38:17.904
and I have no idea
who she is anymore.

38:21.908 --> 38:27.914
I've always thought
of my dad as...

38:27.957 --> 38:31.439
as a--a coward.

38:35.791 --> 38:40.970
But he was holding me.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.669
He was holding me
like he wanted me.

38:47.934 --> 38:53.592
And he tried to reach out
so many times.

38:53.635 --> 38:57.335
I never answered,
and I was okay with it.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.777
But what if I was wrong?

39:04.820 --> 39:08.911
[sobbing]

39:08.955 --> 39:15.657
The fact that he died knowing
that I-I hated him...

39:15.701 --> 39:19.748
There's just--there's no
making that right, is there?

39:23.970 --> 39:28.453
- Well, the good news is,
I would never accept

39:28.496 --> 39:30.019
that memory in court either.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.457
- [laughs]

39:32.500 --> 39:34.067
- It's just inadmissible.

39:38.637 --> 39:41.640
You wanna know something
really messed up about memory?

39:41.683 --> 39:45.034
Literally the least important
thing about them

39:45.078 --> 39:47.689
are if they actually happened.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.735
But who cares?
I mean, we do.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.041
We care deeply.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.130
I mean, we build
this story about ourselves.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.523
We tell ourselves--
we make it big.

39:55.567 --> 39:56.916
It's our truth, you know?

39:56.959 --> 40:00.006
But we--we can't base
that story in fact.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.443
We just can't.

40:02.487 --> 40:05.446
We base it in memories,

40:05.490 --> 40:10.103
and memories are--well,

40:10.146 --> 40:13.585
I don't--I don't even know.
They're nothing.

40:13.628 --> 40:16.065
They're in the ether.

40:16.109 --> 40:21.114
So maybe try not
to define yourself by them.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.556
- But if memory's bollocks,
then what do I rely on?

40:28.600 --> 40:35.041
- What about right now,
the present?

40:35.084 --> 40:39.001
What makes you feel safe?

40:39.045 --> 40:43.528
You know, what makes you feel
pleasure here?

40:43.571 --> 40:50.535
Right now,
what makes you feel love?

40:50.578 --> 40:54.930
[siren wailing]

40:58.107 --> 41:00.762
- Well, I hope you're happy.

41:00.806 --> 41:04.940
The Manhattan will never
display art in our halls again.

41:04.984 --> 41:06.551
- Oh, no.

41:06.594 --> 41:09.902
What a crushing loss for our
hospital that is not a museum.

41:09.945 --> 41:11.556
- A partnership
with the Manhattan

41:11.599 --> 41:12.861
could have
opened up partnerships

41:12.905 --> 41:15.603
with the Philharmonic,
with the City Ballet,

41:15.647 --> 41:17.953
with the Yankees,
and bam, New Amsterdam

41:17.997 --> 41:20.521
is a brand that's ready
to change medicine.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.567
- You know what I hate
about the word "brand"?

41:22.610 --> 41:23.916
- Hmm?

41:23.959 --> 41:25.744
- It implies that whatever
you're doing

41:25.787 --> 41:28.964
you wouldn't be doing it unless
the cameras were rolling.

41:29.008 --> 41:32.533
That's not us. New Amsterdam
doesn't have a brand.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.666
It has a creed. We help people.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.668
And your little makeover
of our lobby--

41:36.711 --> 41:38.931
- Okay, enough,
enough with the lobby.

41:38.974 --> 41:41.499
What is it with you
and this glorified hallway?

41:41.542 --> 41:45.024
- It tells our patients that
this hospital isn't yours,

41:45.067 --> 41:48.941
and it isn't mine.
It's theirs, the Lenape plaque,

41:48.984 --> 41:51.596
the COVID Memorial,
the Black Lives Matter mural.

41:51.639 --> 41:54.903
All these things tell
our patients that this hospital

41:54.947 --> 41:56.426
is for everyone.

41:56.470 --> 41:59.125
And you are erasing that,
and you are erasing patients.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.692
- Well, if that's how
you really feel

42:00.735 --> 42:02.607
maybe you shouldn't leave.
- You know what?

42:02.650 --> 42:04.957
If it means leaving
this hospital in your hands,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.741
then maybe I won't.
