00:46.796 --> 00:49.263
    Lily, are you all right?    

00:49.264 --> 00:52.333
                Where's my wife?
What are you talking about?     

00:52.334 --> 00:54.419
Mr. Tyler, when your wife       
  fainted this morning,         

00:54.420 --> 00:55.520
 she was a young woman.         

00:55.521 --> 00:57.722
     When she woke up           
less than a minute later,       

00:57.723 --> 00:59.724
she was 50 years older?         

00:59.725 --> 01:00.925
  Are you my mother?            

01:02.795 --> 01:04.694
            Richard, I'm dying. 

01:04.696 --> 01:06.998
             ROSS:              
     I understand there was     
an incident this morning.       

01:06.999 --> 01:09.100
 You attempted to harm yourself.

01:09.101 --> 01:11.318
         You had no right       
        to do that!             

01:11.319 --> 01:12.570
        Don't you understand    
            who you are?        

01:12.571 --> 01:14.038
         What you're here to do?

01:14.039 --> 01:16.691
 I'm injecting myself           
with a modified version         

01:16.692 --> 01:18.660
of the promicin serum.          

01:18.661 --> 01:22.247
    I have taught my body       
      how to produce promicin.  

01:22.248 --> 01:24.849
         And then I will be     
    the first non-returnee      

01:24.850 --> 01:27.218
      to develop 4400 abilities.

01:27.219 --> 01:29.153
That was T.J. Kim running       
      from the courthouse.      

01:29.154 --> 01:31.423
  When she hit this place, T.J. 
 drove every man in the building

01:31.424 --> 01:32.858
         into a homicidal rage. 

01:32.859 --> 01:34.392
         Ever since we took them
            off the inhibitor,  

01:34.393 --> 01:35.993
             they're either     
    developing new abilities,   

01:35.994 --> 01:37.945
or they're refining the ones    
      that they've got.         

01:37.946 --> 01:39.580
So they are                     
getting more dangerous.         

01:39.581 --> 01:41.816
    You saved my life.

            We're talking now.

Look, I'm training my body      

03:42.805 --> 03:46.124
to produce a new                
neurotransmitter.               

03:46.125 --> 03:48.726
      And I guarantee you,      
  I'm not the only one trying.  

03:49.812 --> 03:53.848
The moment the first 4400       
manifested an ability,          

03:53.849 --> 03:56.034
an arms race began.             

03:56.035 --> 03:59.554
  Someone is going to produce   
        a promicin serum        

03:59.555 --> 04:01.773
 that will cause non-4400s      

04:01.774 --> 04:03.375
 to develop extraordinary       
        abilities.              

04:03.376 --> 04:04.743
 It will happen.                

04:04.744 --> 04:07.628
And the only questions are,     
who's going to do it?           

04:07.629 --> 04:10.398
And who's going to control it?  

04:10.399 --> 04:12.233
        Hopefully, someone      
        with a highly developed 

04:12.234 --> 04:15.002
    sense of responsibility.    

04:15.003 --> 04:16.370
            And some judgment.  

04:16.372 --> 04:17.538
Let me ask you.                 

04:17.539 --> 04:18.939
Do you meet many people         
like that                       

04:18.940 --> 04:20.291
in your day-to-day affairs?     

04:20.291 --> 04:22.844
Do a lot of them hold           
high-ranking government posts   

04:22.845 --> 04:26.447
or sit on the board of giant    
pharmaceutical companies?       

04:26.448 --> 04:30.702
Dr. Burkhoff, I knew that       
you had some personality quirks,

04:30.703 --> 04:33.003
        but I never pegged you  
             for a cynic.       

04:36.442 --> 04:40.278
    I can't afford to have a    
charitable view of human nature.

04:40.279 --> 04:41.946
There's too much at stake here. 

04:41.947 --> 04:45.383
If these experiments            
cost me some headaches,         

04:45.384 --> 04:46.884
some sores,                     

04:46.885 --> 04:48.953
    I'd say that's              
a price worth paying.           

04:50.155 --> 04:51.522
Wouldn't you?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.984
         Now maybe T.J. used her
             ability on him.    

08:39.985 --> 08:41.652
No, she had concentrated        
promicin inhibitor              

08:41.653 --> 08:42.653
pumping through her veins.      

08:42.654 --> 08:43.854
Now we tried to contact Tom,    

08:43.855 --> 08:45.356
but he hasn't been              
picking up his phone.           

08:45.357 --> 08:47.275
We need to get him in here,     
figure out what happened.       

08:47.276 --> 08:48.860
Okay. But just let me           
talk to him first.              

08:48.861 --> 08:50.361
He trusts me.                   

08:50.362 --> 08:53.064
  Look, this is Tom.            

08:53.065 --> 08:54.748
Come on, we owe him that much.  

08:56.885 --> 08:58.102
                  Yeah, okay.   

08:59.471 --> 09:03.173
    ( radio chatter )           

09:03.174 --> 09:06.744
I wasn't trying to drown myself.

09:06.745 --> 09:08.245
I don't even know if I could.   

09:08.246 --> 09:09.480
      Okay.                     

09:09.481 --> 09:10.615
Isabelle, I just thought        

09:10.616 --> 09:12.516
that after everything           
that happened with Lily--       

09:12.517 --> 09:15.486
         Shawn, this has nothing
          to do with my mother. 

09:18.990 --> 09:21.392
  I was teaching myself to swim.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.110
     ( scoffs )                 

09:23.111 --> 09:25.129
In your clothes?                

09:25.130 --> 09:27.765
        Well-- I never wore     
          a bathing suit before.

09:27.766 --> 09:30.617
      I didn't know what to get.

09:30.618 --> 09:32.753
            And I'm too old     
            to ask for help.    

09:32.754 --> 09:34.906
         It's embarrassing      
      not knowing how to swim.  

09:34.907 --> 09:38.492
Everybody's gotta learn         
sometime, Isabelle.             

09:38.493 --> 09:40.627
I learned when I was a kid.     

09:40.628 --> 09:42.262
          But I never was a kid.

09:42.263 --> 09:44.799
      That's why I never learned
     how to swim or how to drive

09:44.800 --> 09:47.334
     or ever went out on a date.

09:47.335 --> 09:51.105
         I keep reading about   
     all these rites of passage.

09:51.106 --> 09:53.373
Like stuff everyone goes through
before they grow up?            

09:53.374 --> 09:54.508
    Yeah.                       
                      Yeah,     

09:54.509 --> 09:55.976
             but I am grown up. 

09:55.977 --> 09:59.046
                And I missed out
                  on all of it. 

09:59.047 --> 10:00.581
            It's not fair.      

10:01.733 --> 10:03.634
            I've gotta catch up,
              so I made a list. 

10:03.635 --> 10:04.985
                    A list?     

10:04.986 --> 10:08.723
        That's pretty organized.

10:08.724 --> 10:09.724
                Well, Isabelle, 

10:09.725 --> 10:11.592
there is a pool at the Center.  

10:11.593 --> 10:13.277
I could probably                
teach you the basics.           

10:13.278 --> 10:15.013
                Really?         
  Mm-hmm.                       

10:17.216 --> 10:19.384
  Thanks, Shawn.                
                     Mm-hmm.    

10:33.799 --> 10:35.666
 Dad?                           

10:35.667 --> 10:37.818
    How old were you            
when you learned how to swim?   

10:39.071 --> 10:40.637
                Huh.            

10:40.638 --> 10:44.041
             Oh, uh...about 11, 
                  I guess.      

10:44.993 --> 10:47.395
  Why? You want me to teach you?

10:47.396 --> 10:50.131
      That's okay.              
 Shawn said he'd do it.         

10:50.132 --> 10:51.599
        Oh, he did, did he?     

10:51.600 --> 10:53.100
                Mm-hmm.         

10:53.101 --> 10:56.904
Well, make sure he doesn't throw
you in the deep end right away. 

10:56.905 --> 11:00.057
      That's what my grandmother
              did to me.        

11:00.058 --> 11:02.226
             Look, uh, Isabelle,

11:02.227 --> 11:03.277
  I'm gonna be gone overnight.  

11:03.278 --> 11:04.562
          If you need anything, 
              go see Shawn.     

11:04.563 --> 11:05.846
 Where are you going?           

11:08.367 --> 11:10.634
I'm gonna take your mother home.

11:10.635 --> 11:13.187
        I'm putting her to rest.

11:13.188 --> 11:14.722
Well, can I come with you?      

11:16.858 --> 11:18.092
             I don't think so.  

11:18.093 --> 11:20.227
        I'm flying, and, uh--   

11:21.780 --> 11:24.265
          To tell you the truth,

11:24.266 --> 11:26.834
    I don't think you're ready  
 to be away from the Center yet.

11:28.353 --> 11:31.622
You wanna be alone with her     
when you say goodbye, don't you?

11:36.378 --> 11:37.844
         Yeah, I guess I do.    

12:09.594 --> 12:13.164
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )       

12:13.165 --> 12:14.232
      Tom.                      

12:14.233 --> 12:15.349
            Oh, God!            

12:16.301 --> 12:17.768
You scared the hell             
 out of me, Diana.              

12:17.769 --> 12:20.637
What are you doing here?        

12:20.638 --> 12:22.823
Why is your gun out?            
What the hell is going on?      

12:22.824 --> 12:24.926
     Jarvis is on her way over. 
    She's got everyone with her.

12:24.927 --> 12:25.893
            You need to come in.

12:26.695 --> 12:28.212
Why? What are you talking about?

12:28.213 --> 12:30.431
             You shot T.J. Kim  
            this morning.       

12:30.432 --> 12:32.233
         What?                  
          You don't remember?   

12:32.234 --> 12:33.934
     Don't remember?            
 I didn't shoot anybody.        

12:33.935 --> 12:36.136
  I've been here all morning.   
    Can someone confirm that?   

12:38.056 --> 12:39.189
            No. No,             

12:39.190 --> 12:40.791
I was supposed to have          
  a conference call             

12:40.792 --> 12:41.792
 with Kyle's attorneys.         

12:41.793 --> 12:43.711
  They cancelled, though.       

12:43.712 --> 12:45.963
 Look, I took a half            
a personal day, Diana.          

12:45.964 --> 12:48.883
I went jogging. I wasn't--      
    I wasn't at work.           

12:48.884 --> 12:50.016
     You gotta stop saying that,

12:50.017 --> 12:52.470
        because two dozen people
             saw you there.     

12:52.471 --> 12:53.838
              Look, I don't know
            what's going on.    

12:53.839 --> 12:56.006
                             I--

12:56.007 --> 12:58.742
    Maybe you're blacking out   
             like Kyle did.     

12:58.743 --> 12:59.593
      Maybe it's something else.

12:59.594 --> 13:01.929
            Maybe it's like     
          some...4400 ability.  

13:01.930 --> 13:05.366
        I mean I don't know,    
      but...you gotta come in.  

13:05.367 --> 13:06.967
And what happens if I do?       

13:06.968 --> 13:08.168
    I get arrested for murder?  

13:08.169 --> 13:09.820
          You know, we'll figure
                  it out, okay? 

13:09.821 --> 13:10.855
     Everyone wants to help you.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.456
             You just-- You just
                have to come in.

13:16.111 --> 13:17.728
    Well, you mind if           
      I get dressed first?      

13:17.729 --> 13:19.413
                 Oh. Sure.      

13:23.986 --> 13:26.353
Are you sure you remember       
everything you did this morning?

13:26.354 --> 13:29.222
Like, there's no time gaps      
          or anything?          

13:29.223 --> 13:31.191
 You didn't take a nap?         

13:31.192 --> 13:33.177
     Because Tom...             

13:34.629 --> 13:35.863
                  Tom?          

13:40.601 --> 13:41.835
            Damn it!            

13:47.059 --> 13:48.592
      Yeah, hi. It's me.        

13:48.593 --> 13:49.827
              He got away.      

13:51.997 --> 13:53.397
         I-- I don't know how.  

13:53.398 --> 13:55.333
        They only sent one agent
            after him.          

13:55.334 --> 13:58.502
      Look, sorry. He got away. 

13:58.503 --> 14:00.637
     What? No way.              
  He's an NTAC agent.           

14:00.638 --> 14:03.174
 He'll be expecting that.       

14:03.175 --> 14:04.242
             Okay.              

14:05.410 --> 14:07.111
              You're right.     
        This has to happen.     

14:07.112 --> 14:08.645
                I'll do it.     

14:10.249 --> 14:11.598
 I was letting him get dressed. 

14:11.599 --> 14:14.201
    I didn't think he would jump
     from a second-story window.

14:14.202 --> 14:15.603
  Well, obviously you           
     underestimated             

14:15.604 --> 14:16.903
 your partner's resolve.        

14:16.904 --> 14:18.606
Well, does he still             
  seem blameless to you?        

14:18.607 --> 14:19.473
        I don't know. Look,     

14:19.474 --> 14:20.558
    it was a really bad call,   

14:20.559 --> 14:22.493
 and I take full responsibility.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.244
I've alerted local              
law enforcement, the FBI.       

14:24.245 --> 14:26.263
I've told them that Tom is      
wanted for questioning          

14:26.264 --> 14:27.565
in connection with the murder.  

14:27.566 --> 14:29.082
He's a fugitive now.            

14:29.083 --> 14:31.585
Oh, don't give me that look,    
  Diana. I had no choice.       

14:31.586 --> 14:33.303
      ( cell phone rings )      

14:33.304 --> 14:35.338
                Sorry.          
                 It's Tom.      

14:35.339 --> 14:36.273
         Yeah.                  

14:36.274 --> 14:38.258
                    Tom.        

14:38.259 --> 14:39.426
     <i>Sorry I ran out on you.</i>    

14:39.427 --> 14:40.995
         Where are you?         

14:40.996 --> 14:42.429
I didn't kill T.J.,             
I didn't kill anyone.           

14:42.430 --> 14:43.948
             <i>I believe you, </i>    
     <i>but you have to come in,</i>   

14:43.949 --> 14:45.249
    and we can figure it out.   

14:45.250 --> 14:46.433
   <i>No, I'm not going to jail.</i>   

14:46.434 --> 14:47.601
         No one's gonna put you 
            in prison.          

14:47.602 --> 14:49.653
  <i>They did it to my son, Diana.</i> 

14:49.654 --> 14:51.338
    Was it really him           
 that pulled the trigger        

14:51.339 --> 14:53.407
the day Jordan Collier died?    
  No, it wasn't, was it?        

14:53.408 --> 14:54.574
It was that thing inside of him.

14:54.575 --> 14:56.110
And where's Kyle?               
He's incarcerated.              

14:56.111 --> 14:57.428
       <i>You're a fugitive, Tom.</i>  

14:57.429 --> 15:00.280
    Every police department in  
  Washington is looking for you.

15:00.281 --> 15:02.432
 <i>Now if some local cop who</i>      
  <i>wants to be a hero spots you,</i> 

15:02.433 --> 15:03.884
              you know how      
         these things can end.  

15:03.885 --> 15:06.219
    It's gonna end with me      
proving I didn't do this.       

15:06.821 --> 15:09.039
 <i>Look, dig around, Diana.</i>       

15:09.040 --> 15:10.841
  There's got to be some        
evidence that'll clear me.      

15:10.842 --> 15:13.844
  Just...help me find it.       

15:16.197 --> 15:17.348
Did he give you a location?     

15:26.257 --> 15:29.026
    Marco, help me out here.    

15:29.027 --> 15:30.260
    If you were trying to prove 

15:30.261 --> 15:32.229
        that your partner       
         didn't commit a crime  

15:32.230 --> 15:34.998
             that the whole     
          world thinks he did,  

15:34.999 --> 15:37.167
         where would you start? 

15:37.168 --> 15:38.936
Well, I...guess I'd start       
by pretending that              

15:38.937 --> 15:41.238
my partner wasn't involved.     

15:43.241 --> 15:46.076
Okay, just think of it          
like any other case.            

15:46.077 --> 15:47.861
  I mean, what's the first thing
      you do when you start?    

15:47.862 --> 15:49.362
     Well, look at the evidence.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.098
    I mean, there's a dead body.

15:51.099 --> 15:53.100
            There's the gun that
              Tom left behind.  

15:53.101 --> 15:55.202
And there's a bunch of people   
         that saw him here.     

15:56.738 --> 15:58.773
             Well, they got     
         security cameras down  

15:58.774 --> 16:00.007
in the detention ward, right?   

16:01.842 --> 16:02.860
      You're serious?           

16:02.861 --> 16:04.995
You're really asking me         
 for all that footage?          

16:04.996 --> 16:07.264
Of course I'm serious.          
Is that a problem?              

16:07.265 --> 16:08.482
Well, it's just...              

16:09.751 --> 16:11.585
  I gave all the tapes to him,  
    like, an hour ago.          

16:12.837 --> 16:13.904
             Whoa.              

16:14.689 --> 16:15.939
     What are you talking about?

16:15.940 --> 16:17.341
I haven't been up here all day. 

16:17.342 --> 16:19.009
 What is this, a joke?          

16:20.027 --> 16:21.227
                 Marco, come on.

16:21.228 --> 16:22.879
You were just here.             

16:22.880 --> 16:24.965
 You signed for the footage     
  from the detention ward.      

16:29.036 --> 16:30.087
    This isn't so hard.         

16:30.088 --> 16:32.289
            That's because      
        I haven't let go yet.   

16:32.290 --> 16:33.657
            All right,          
        I'm gonna move my hands.

16:33.658 --> 16:34.725
            Are you ready?      

16:34.726 --> 16:37.495
      No, not yet.              
I'm kind of comfortable.        

16:37.496 --> 16:38.595
     You're kind of comfortable?

16:39.797 --> 16:41.849
        I'm freezing.           
I don't know what's going on.   

16:41.850 --> 16:43.751
      This pool is              
 supposed to be heated.         

16:43.752 --> 16:44.451
Want me to make it warmer?      

16:44.452 --> 16:45.969
            Oh, you can do that?

16:45.970 --> 16:48.639
I think so. Hold on.            

16:52.493 --> 16:55.028
      ( thunder rumbles )       

16:55.897 --> 16:57.064
        How do you do that?     

16:58.132 --> 16:59.700
 I don't know. How do you heal? 

17:00.685 --> 17:02.837
        That's not the same,    
                Isabelle.       

17:02.838 --> 17:04.438
        Healing is one thing.   

17:04.439 --> 17:06.272
      That's what we can all do,
              one thing.        

17:06.273 --> 17:08.491
         Not me.                
  I guess I'm different.        

17:10.744 --> 17:12.630
                          Shawn?

17:12.631 --> 17:14.080
          I'm sorry to barge in.

17:14.082 --> 17:16.183
        We're scheduled to brief
         the board of directors.

17:16.184 --> 17:17.384
          That's starting now?  

17:17.385 --> 17:18.702
            Five minutes ago.   

17:18.703 --> 17:20.470
                They're on hold.

17:40.825 --> 17:42.159
                        BALDWIN:
                          Psst. 

17:42.160 --> 17:43.360
              ( whispers ):     
                 Alana.         

17:43.361 --> 17:45.346
            Thomas.             
    What are you doing here?    

17:45.347 --> 17:46.881
                  Shhh.         

17:46.882 --> 17:48.181
             I'm in trouble.    

17:48.182 --> 17:51.435
          My bosses at NTAC,    
     they think I did something.

17:51.436 --> 17:52.586
     I need you to come with me.

17:52.587 --> 17:53.687
What are you talking about?     

17:53.688 --> 17:54.772
I don't have time to explain.   

17:54.773 --> 17:56.006
                    Just--      
         Thomas!                

17:56.007 --> 17:58.625
      ( cell phone rings )      

17:59.794 --> 18:00.578
                 Hello?         

18:00.579 --> 18:01.645
             BALDWIN:           
              <i>Alana.</i>            

18:01.646 --> 18:03.296
      <i>I'm right down the street.</i>

18:03.297 --> 18:04.348
  I need you to come meet me.   

18:04.349 --> 18:05.532
     <i>Honey, I'm in trouble.</i>     

18:05.533 --> 18:07.567
              <i>Everyone thinks</i>   
             <i>I killed somebody.</i> 

18:07.568 --> 18:09.820
              Who is this?      
        I know it's not Thomas. 

18:09.821 --> 18:11.037
What are you talking about?     

18:11.038 --> 18:13.940
         <i>I'm looking at</i>         
     <i>Thomas right now.</i>          

18:13.941 --> 18:15.576
Honey, listen. That's not me.   

18:15.577 --> 18:18.579
The man you're looking at,      
he can impersonate me somehow.  

18:18.580 --> 18:20.214
      I don't believe you.      

18:20.215 --> 18:22.232
     <i>He walked into NTAC and</i>    
  <i>he shot someone this morning.</i> 

18:22.233 --> 18:23.767
         Come on.               
 <i>Alana, he's dangerous!</i>         

18:23.768 --> 18:25.302
  Get away from him.            

18:25.303 --> 18:28.054
  <i>Alana, listen. Your mother's</i>  
 <i>middle name is Madeleine.</i>      

18:28.055 --> 18:29.339
     You wanted a dog           
when you were a kid,            

18:29.340 --> 18:30.841
        but your parents        
        gave you a bird.        

18:30.842 --> 18:32.692
       <i>A parakeet named Charlie.</i>

18:32.693 --> 18:34.278
Listen, we made love last night.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.579
There were two candles burning. 

18:35.580 --> 18:37.281
         Just hold on.          
      I'll be right there.      

18:40.518 --> 18:41.668
Did I have a dog                
  when I was a girl?            

18:41.669 --> 18:42.803
    I don't have time for this. 

18:42.804 --> 18:43.953
What are you doing?             
    Let me go!                  

18:43.954 --> 18:44.905
What's going on, Tom?           

18:50.711 --> 18:51.412
  Are you all right?            

18:51.413 --> 18:52.696
                     Yes.       

18:52.697 --> 18:54.297
Where is he?                    
  He just went through the back.

19:00.455 --> 19:01.471
              Hey!              

19:02.807 --> 19:04.441
  Did you see a guy             
come down this alley?           

19:04.442 --> 19:05.659
He looked exactly like me.      

19:05.660 --> 19:06.776
          I didn't see anybody. 

19:06.777 --> 19:08.629
                 You sure?      

19:21.276 --> 19:22.309
        He's gone.              

19:22.310 --> 19:23.860
                      Where?    
      He's gone.                

19:23.861 --> 19:24.895
        What do you mean?       

19:24.896 --> 19:26.630
            He just ran out     
              a few seconds ago.

19:26.631 --> 19:28.565
There was no one here.          
Just some kid--                 

19:31.002 --> 19:33.003
          It was him.           

19:33.004 --> 19:35.939
        It had to be.           

19:35.940 --> 19:37.341
     I had him. I had him.      

19:37.342 --> 19:38.342
                    Had who?    

19:38.343 --> 19:40.411
 What kid are you talking about?

19:40.412 --> 19:42.446
  The one who's                 
impersonating me.               

19:42.447 --> 19:45.065
    The guy who's               
framing me for murder.          

19:50.755 --> 19:52.840
             He looked like you.
            He sounded like you.

19:52.841 --> 19:54.942
     He was standing as close as
    you are to me right now.    

19:54.943 --> 19:56.276
             And he had me      
        completely fooled.      

19:56.277 --> 19:57.194
    Don't feel bad.             

19:57.195 --> 19:59.179
He fooled everyone              
      at NTAC too.              

19:59.180 --> 20:01.481
        At least we know        
      what's going on now.      

20:01.482 --> 20:03.984
          He's a 4400, isn't he?
    Yes.                        

20:03.985 --> 20:05.903
             Somehow he can     
        pass himself off as you.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.337
 Yeah, I'm not sure how.        

20:07.338 --> 20:10.707
I mean, maybe he's got          
some kind of optical camouflage.

20:10.708 --> 20:11.975
He can convince your brain      

20:11.976 --> 20:14.044
you're talking to whoever       
  he wants you to see.          

20:14.045 --> 20:14.828
            He's a boy.         

20:14.829 --> 20:16.379
        Why would he want       
         to kill anyone?        

20:16.380 --> 20:17.514
Not just anybody.               

20:17.515 --> 20:18.681
    T.J. Kim.                   

20:18.682 --> 20:19.917
The one member of               
    the Nova Group              

20:19.918 --> 20:21.218
we had in custody.              

20:21.219 --> 20:24.454
I mean, think about it.         
It's a good plan.               

20:24.455 --> 20:26.173
    You get rid of              
the one member of your cell     

20:26.174 --> 20:27.674
who could testify               
      against you.              

20:27.675 --> 20:29.209
    You compromise              
 a government agent.            

20:29.210 --> 20:33.080
And NTAC, the one agency        
that's trying to hunt you down, 

20:33.081 --> 20:35.015
  is wasting their time         
chasing one of their own.       

20:35.016 --> 20:36.149
                          Alana.

20:36.150 --> 20:37.884
You might want to get in here.  

20:37.885 --> 20:40.286
      There's all kind of people
     flashing badges everywhere.

20:40.287 --> 20:42.172
 They said they're NTAC agents. 

20:42.173 --> 20:44.124
Look, stall them.               
I want you to go home.          

20:44.125 --> 20:45.542
I want you to lock the doors    

20:45.543 --> 20:48.045
and don't open it               
until this is all cleared up.   

20:48.046 --> 20:51.214
If I need to get a hold of you, 
I'll use a password.            

20:52.533 --> 20:54.334
      How about <i>Death in Venice?</i>

20:54.335 --> 20:56.670
  Your favorite book.           
  It's a good choice.           

21:01.059 --> 21:03.360
            BALDWIN:            
    Listen, Shawn, thanks for   
     letting me come in here.   

21:03.361 --> 21:04.461
I-- I know it puts you at risk. 

21:04.462 --> 21:05.996
    I just didn't know          
        where else to go.       

21:07.465 --> 21:10.217
    Look, you guys must have    
a database of 4400s here, right?

21:10.218 --> 21:11.684
             Yeah.              
     I need to get a look at it.

21:11.685 --> 21:13.103
    Okay.                       
    Find out who this kid is.   

21:13.104 --> 21:14.705
Here. I can pull it up          
on my laptop for you.           

21:14.706 --> 21:16.473
    Great.                      

21:16.474 --> 21:19.609
    This might take a while.    
Do you mind if I let myself out?

21:19.610 --> 21:21.228
     No, that's fine.           

21:24.732 --> 21:25.865
 There you go.                  

21:25.866 --> 21:29.269
You know, Tom, you can stay     
    here if you want.           

21:30.405 --> 21:31.405
I might take you up on it.      

21:31.406 --> 21:32.856
All right.                      

21:32.857 --> 21:35.092
  But, hey, you get the couch.  

21:35.093 --> 21:37.561
          ( chuckles )          

21:37.562 --> 21:39.997
          Okay.                 

21:39.998 --> 21:42.232
             Kidneys, huh?      

21:42.233 --> 21:44.334
        That explains the blood 
             in the urine.      

21:44.335 --> 21:45.636
     Kevin, we had a deal.      

21:45.637 --> 21:47.037
I was going to help you         
through this                    

21:47.038 --> 21:48.805
  as long as it wasn't          
compromising your health.       

21:48.806 --> 21:51.825
    Well, guess what,           
I'm calling the hospital.       

21:51.826 --> 21:54.444
        But they won't let me   
            take my shots.      

21:54.445 --> 21:56.630
         Oh, no.                
You're done with your shots.    

21:56.631 --> 21:59.616
     I know we had an agreement.
          And I'll honor it.    

21:59.617 --> 22:03.320
        Just-- Let me show you  
      something before you call.

22:08.576 --> 22:10.960
             What happened      
         to your fingernails?   

22:10.961 --> 22:12.613
They fell off.                  
Dissolved, I guess you'd say.   

22:12.614 --> 22:14.681
    God, if you're trying to    
            change my mind,     

22:14.682 --> 22:16.483
        you're not doing        
    a very good job--           

22:16.484 --> 22:18.335
                ( screams )     

22:18.336 --> 22:19.837
                     ( screams )

22:19.838 --> 22:22.588
        Kevin, what the hell    
             did you just do?   

22:27.112 --> 22:29.379
        ( gasps )               

22:34.202 --> 22:38.939
Your tissue is healing itself   
     from trauma that quickly?  

22:40.808 --> 22:43.543
         Kevin, you've developed
             a 4400 ability.    

22:44.228 --> 22:46.079
    It's getting there.         

22:46.080 --> 22:47.413
  Doesn't always work.          

22:47.414 --> 22:49.165
        Doesn't always work?    

22:49.166 --> 22:51.401
      You just put a scalpel    
  through the back of your hand.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.836
            I know.             

22:52.837 --> 22:54.520
I was nervous about that.       

23:03.665 --> 23:05.532
    ( brakes screech )          

23:06.467 --> 23:08.251
                     ( gasps )  

23:08.252 --> 23:10.153
    These are fun to drive fast.

23:10.154 --> 23:13.289
        Yeah.                   

23:13.290 --> 23:16.359
  You know, all that information
  about compression rates, and--

23:16.360 --> 23:18.412
And gear ratios just seems      
     completely irrelevant.     

23:18.413 --> 23:20.363
  Well, you're not driving home.

23:20.364 --> 23:21.098
            Get out of there.   

23:21.099 --> 23:23.183
                      ( laughs )
         ( sighs )              

23:23.184 --> 23:25.852
    You're lucky you didn't     
wrap my car around a pole.      

23:25.853 --> 23:28.305
  Is there anything on this list
      of yours that involves,   

23:28.306 --> 23:30.741
    you know, a little less risk
        of bodily harm?         

23:32.726 --> 23:34.528
    We could have sex.          

23:34.529 --> 23:35.879
     Come on,                   
you have a big bed.             

23:35.880 --> 23:39.149
             Isabelle. Hey, hey.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.483
                Uh, no.         

23:40.484 --> 23:42.235
     Why? It's on my list.      

23:43.655 --> 23:45.922
It's an important rite          
of passage into adulthood.      

23:47.074 --> 23:49.325
         It'll be fun.          
     I was good at driving.     

23:49.326 --> 23:51.612
         I'm sure you'd catch on
            real quick.         

23:54.148 --> 23:55.749
                  I don't know. 

23:55.750 --> 23:58.017
              For one thing,    
         your dad would kill me.

23:58.018 --> 23:59.519
    Why? I'm an adult.          

23:59.520 --> 24:02.055
             Well, you are,     
    and you aren't, Isabelle.   

24:02.056 --> 24:03.239
  Let's just say, he has a right

24:03.240 --> 24:04.775
         to have an opinion     
        on the matter.          

24:04.776 --> 24:05.808
        I don't know, Isabelle. 

24:05.809 --> 24:08.612
        I feel like I'd be      
        taking advantage of you.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.846
    But I want to.              

24:11.232 --> 24:13.433
    Well, I'm flattered.        
        I really am.            

24:13.434 --> 24:15.636
But I just don't think you're   
ready to make that decision.    

24:15.637 --> 24:17.103
We barely know each other.      

24:17.104 --> 24:21.041
 I know you better than I know  
anyone else in the world.       

24:24.411 --> 24:25.511
            That may be true.   

24:25.512 --> 24:26.997
    It's still not gonna happen.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.922
        Lessons with Isabelle   
                going well?     

24:35.923 --> 24:36.956
    Not lessons,                

24:36.957 --> 24:39.760
  and it's completely           
    innocent.                   

24:39.761 --> 24:43.062
Do me a favor                   
and don't ask about them again. 

24:49.654 --> 24:52.656
    ( phone ringing )           

24:52.657 --> 24:53.891
        This is Skouris.        

24:53.892 --> 24:55.108
His name is Boyd Gelder, Diana. 

24:55.109 --> 24:56.927
             He's a 4400.       
        I know where he lives.  

24:56.928 --> 24:59.062
     Where who lives?           
    Who's Boyd Gelder?          

24:59.063 --> 25:01.131
 <i>The kid who's doing this.</i>      

25:01.132 --> 25:02.815
He can imitate me somehow.      
     And not just imitate.      

25:02.816 --> 25:04.517
         He can be me.          

25:04.518 --> 25:06.853
        At least,               
    make you think he's me.     

25:06.854 --> 25:08.188
     He lives with his mom.     

25:08.189 --> 25:09.956
     I'm in Schenley Park.      
    It's right by his house.    

25:09.957 --> 25:11.891
Well, can you wait for me?      
      I'll be 15 minutes.       

25:11.892 --> 25:12.959
           <i>I'll wait.</i>           

25:12.960 --> 25:15.162
     But, Diana, just you.      

25:15.163 --> 25:17.663
    Just me.                    

25:17.664 --> 25:19.299
We just got here.               
Where are you going?            

25:19.300 --> 25:21.834
      Schenley Park. I think    
we caught a break on Tom's case.

25:38.002 --> 25:39.335
Tom!                            

25:41.873 --> 25:43.273
     Tom!                       

25:48.629 --> 25:50.364
    ( <i>tense theme playing</i> )     

26:05.779 --> 26:08.514
    ( kids cheering )           

26:14.321 --> 26:15.872
I didn't tell anyone, Tom.      

26:15.873 --> 26:20.043
                  Just Marco.   

26:20.044 --> 26:21.945
              At least I thought
                 it was Marco.  

26:26.917 --> 26:29.719
            BALDWIN:            
I looked across the park.       
    You were standing there.    

26:29.720 --> 26:31.387
             It was you.        

26:31.388 --> 26:32.388
        But it wasn't.          

26:32.389 --> 26:33.623
Listen, tell me about it.       

26:33.624 --> 26:35.458
You weren't the one             
actually chasing yourself       

26:35.459 --> 26:36.793
across the park.                

26:36.794 --> 26:39.796
I mean, I don't really          
run like that, do I?            

26:42.200 --> 26:44.251
It's an amazing ability.        

26:44.252 --> 26:46.119
Marco's gonna have a field day  
over this.                      

26:46.120 --> 26:47.354
                Good.           
        Get him working on it.  

26:47.355 --> 26:48.888
         We're gonna need a way 
        to handle this guy      

26:48.889 --> 26:50.857
        when we get him         
            into custody.       

26:50.858 --> 26:52.158
Well, wait. Wait. Wait.         

26:52.159 --> 26:53.910
    No, you don't need          
 to skulk around anymore.       

26:53.911 --> 26:55.479
      You can come in           
    with me, now.               

26:55.480 --> 26:57.313
        I'm still on the hook   
             for murder, Diana. 

26:57.314 --> 26:58.314
     No, you're not.            

26:58.315 --> 26:59.850
    Boyd posed as you.          

26:59.851 --> 27:02.018
    He shot T.J. Kim.           
 You're not responsible.        

27:02.019 --> 27:05.021
Listen, I just saw his          
abilities with my own eyes.     

27:05.022 --> 27:06.790
That's proof of something       
    right there.                

27:06.791 --> 27:08.558
I will back you up              
on everything you say.          

27:08.559 --> 27:10.661
    Which means exactly nothing.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.562
        Thank you, Diana,       
         but you're my partner. 

27:12.563 --> 27:14.531
         Everyone expects you   
          to stand up for me.   

27:14.532 --> 27:15.332
            There's only one way

27:15.333 --> 27:17.551
            to prove I didn't   
                kill T.J. Kim.  

27:17.552 --> 27:19.218
      I have to get Boyd Gelder.

27:19.219 --> 27:21.521
Okay, let's go.                 

27:21.522 --> 27:22.656
                  You're sure   
            you want to come?   

27:22.657 --> 27:24.791
  I'm your partner.             

27:24.792 --> 27:26.793
Everyone expects that           
I'll stand up for you.          

27:32.283 --> 27:34.768
I should be back by tonight.    

27:34.769 --> 27:37.036
I've...been taking my time,     

27:37.037 --> 27:39.539
stopping off at all the places  
      your mother liked.        

27:42.410 --> 27:44.076
 Everything okay?               

27:44.077 --> 27:45.612
     <i>You been going to</i>          
   <i>your doctor's appointments?</i>  

27:45.613 --> 27:47.681
             Most of them.      
         <i>Isabelle.</i>              

27:47.682 --> 27:49.566
         We'll need to          
      keep monitoring you.      

27:49.567 --> 27:51.168
         <i>I'm fine.</i>              

27:51.169 --> 27:53.904
 Shawn's been taking good care  
  of me, just like you asked.   

27:53.905 --> 27:55.105
He's doing a really good job.   

27:55.106 --> 27:56.039
        Oh, yeah?               

27:56.040 --> 27:58.090
              <i>Yeah.</i>             

27:58.091 --> 28:00.527
He taught me the back stroke.   
      He let me drive his car.  

28:00.528 --> 28:02.979
      <i>And then I asked him</i>      
      <i>to have sex with me,</i>      

28:02.980 --> 28:04.747
         <i>but he said no.</i>        

28:04.748 --> 28:06.399
     He said you'd be angry     
    if we did. Is that true?    

28:08.419 --> 28:15.392
Isabelle, you're too young      
  to be thinking about...that.  

28:15.393 --> 28:16.793
              <i>I am?</i>             

28:16.794 --> 28:19.446
 But I thought I was almost 20. 
            What--?             

28:19.447 --> 28:21.514
        How old were you        
 when you lost your virginity?  

28:23.401 --> 28:26.135
                 It was--       

28:26.136 --> 28:27.637
     Things were a bit different
             in my days.        

28:27.638 --> 28:28.872
        It's not the same.      

28:28.873 --> 28:30.440
            It's not?           

28:30.441 --> 28:31.608
                    Why?        

28:33.794 --> 28:36.362
        You know what, Isabelle?

28:36.363 --> 28:38.865
I'm not having this conversation
    with you over the phone.    

28:40.718 --> 28:42.752
            So Shawn was right. 
                You are mad.    

28:45.823 --> 28:47.657
             I don't understand.

28:47.658 --> 28:49.826
     What does NTAC want to talk
        to my son for, anyway?  

28:49.827 --> 28:50.994
Look, he's in some trouble.     

28:50.995 --> 28:53.362
We can't discuss,               
We just need to talk to him.    

28:53.363 --> 28:55.482
          Well, he's not here.  

28:55.483 --> 28:57.150
      He went away on a ski trip
          with some friends     

28:57.151 --> 28:59.219
and won't be back till tomorrow.

28:59.220 --> 29:02.722
Ma'am, your son is not on a ski 
trip, and this is serious.      

29:02.723 --> 29:04.390
        Is there any way        
         you can contact him?   

29:06.377 --> 29:07.543
First, tell me what's going on. 

29:07.544 --> 29:09.346
    I mean, what is it          
      you think my son did?     

29:10.982 --> 29:13.383
Mrs. Gelder, there are a lot of 
agents looking for Boyd.        

29:13.384 --> 29:15.134
         Situations like this   
         can get very chaotic.  

29:15.135 --> 29:16.669
                People get hurt.

29:16.670 --> 29:18.505
 The sooner we get to your son, 
      the safer he'll be.       

29:18.506 --> 29:20.440
      So why don't you call him 

29:20.441 --> 29:22.641
            and convince him    
          you need to see him?  

29:33.437 --> 29:35.137
        SKOURIS:                
      Boyd's late.              

29:35.138 --> 29:36.539
  I wonder if he'll even show.  

29:36.540 --> 29:39.809
                  BALDWIN:      
             Let's just give him
            another few minutes.

29:39.810 --> 29:42.479
  Nice mom. Nice house.         

29:42.480 --> 29:43.847
      It makes you wonder.      

29:43.848 --> 29:46.282
             If the Nova Group  
             can turn this kid, 

29:46.283 --> 29:47.250
who else have they gotten to?   

29:47.251 --> 29:48.685
     Everyone keeps             
    telling the 4400            

29:48.686 --> 29:50.186
     they're here               
  to save the world.            

29:50.187 --> 29:51.187
            Whatever that means.

29:51.188 --> 29:52.188
      Exactly.                  

29:52.189 --> 29:53.623
I mean, say what you like       
about Nova,                     

29:53.624 --> 29:55.324
but they do seem                
to have a game plan.            

29:55.325 --> 29:57.460
I'm sure that helps             
their recruiting pitch.         

30:01.298 --> 30:04.333
     Well, I'm just guessing,   
  but I don't think that's Boyd.

30:04.334 --> 30:06.636
How the hell did                
NTAC get here?                  

30:06.637 --> 30:08.304
          Maybe Boyd figured out
              it was a trap     

30:08.305 --> 30:09.939
            and tipped them off.

30:28.241 --> 30:29.709
                Alana, open up. 

30:29.710 --> 30:30.876
What are you doing here?        

30:30.877 --> 30:32.512
  There are NTAC agents         
watching the house.             

30:32.513 --> 30:33.546
        They just drove away.   

30:33.547 --> 30:35.214
    They must be changing shifts
            or something.       

30:35.215 --> 30:36.983

I don't want anyone to see me   
     standing out here. Come on.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.192
 What did you do with your key? 

30:46.193 --> 30:48.427
        I lost it.              
      I must have lost it       

30:48.428 --> 30:49.529

                  Tom, Alana.   

30:51.765 --> 30:53.383
        I gave you the password.

31:00.257 --> 31:01.524
         Please don't make me.  

31:01.525 --> 31:03.360
     I don't have anything

            I don't think I can 
        let you do this, Tom.   

32:03.037 --> 32:03.953
         We need to call Jarvis.

32:03.954 --> 32:05.204
We need to block off the street.

 We need to surround your house.

32:07.891 --> 32:09.408
      Tom, he wants to kill you.

      The least that we can do, 

32:10.494 --> 32:12.095
    is make it a little bit     
          difficult for him.    

32:12.096 --> 32:15.481
    If it was Maia in there,    
        would you call Jarvis?

32:31.832 --> 32:33.666
             A young woman      
    should have a nice dress.   

32:35.085 --> 32:36.519
    It's gonna look good on you.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.804
             See for yourself.  

32:47.681 --> 32:50.784
      Thank you.                

32:50.785 --> 32:53.686
      I see you've been spending
    a lot of time with Shawn.   

32:53.687 --> 32:54.720
         So?                    

32:54.721 --> 32:57.574
         I think it's wonderful.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.509
                Shawn's a very  
             isolated young man.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.043
            He doesn't get to   
                spend much time 

33:01.044 --> 33:02.579
      around people his own age.

33:04.915 --> 33:08.718
  I think you should get        
as close to him as you can.     

33:13.190 --> 33:14.190
                  Matthew?      

33:14.191 --> 33:15.925
          Mmm?                  

33:16.677 --> 33:18.828
             Shawn's nice.      

33:18.829 --> 33:20.430
     But what I'm doing with him
        is not for you,         

33:20.431 --> 33:22.198
          and it's not because  
         I'm trying to use him. 

33:23.367 --> 33:25.401
Of course not.                  

33:25.402 --> 33:27.870
 But eventually, Isabelle,      

33:27.871 --> 33:29.706
 you and Shawn are gonna be     
     on opposite sides          

33:29.707 --> 33:32.342
      of a very large           
    ideological divide.         

33:33.527 --> 33:36.629
So...enjoy your friendship.     

33:36.630 --> 33:38.430
But don't let your emotions     
    run too deep.               

33:38.431 --> 33:42.851
If you do, it'll make things    
more difficult later.           

33:45.356 --> 33:46.356
             What things?       

33:46.357 --> 33:48.057
    You'll know.                

33:50.878 --> 33:52.762
It doesn't match your eyes.     

33:52.763 --> 33:54.997

 You looked exactly alike.

        what I'm gonna do.

            But, uh...          

35:01.898 --> 35:03.065
        it makes me feel better,

35:03.066 --> 35:06.202
         knowing the two of you 
              are together.

                  I volunteered.

any spot to be giving me advice.

 Alana, <i>Death in Venice.</i>        

37:31.665 --> 37:33.482
Yeah, that's the password.      

37:33.483 --> 37:34.500
Come on, Alana. Give me the gun.

37:34.501 --> 37:35.835
     We'll call NTAC. It's over.

    ( <i>tense theme playing</i> )     

37:47.647 --> 37:49.848
        Alana, it's me, Tom.    
    Ask me a question. Anything.

37:49.849 --> 37:51.100
        Don't fall for it.      

37:51.101 --> 37:53.035
     He's probably read my file.

37:53.036 --> 37:54.954
He knows everything about us.   
Don't listen to him.            

37:54.955 --> 37:56.521
Ask me something about us.      

37:56.522 --> 37:58.724
Something only I would know.    
        Anything about us.      

37:58.725 --> 38:00.526
        Shut up, both of you.   

38:00.527 --> 38:03.646
Baby, I am so proud of you.     

38:03.647 --> 38:05.014
Billy would have been proud.    

38:06.499 --> 38:07.900
         You know about Billy?  

38:07.901 --> 38:09.352
      Yeah.                     

38:09.353 --> 38:12.187
          That was your son.    
      He died in a car accident.

38:12.188 --> 38:14.657
         Alana, he did research.
     Alana.                     

38:14.658 --> 38:16.058
     Anyone could find that out.

38:16.059 --> 38:16.793

38:16.794 --> 38:18.878

                Give me the gun.

        Alana, give me the gun. 

38:21.965 --> 38:23.632
          Don't.                

38:23.633 --> 38:26.819
         Alana, give me the gun.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.421
        Come on.                

38:29.422 --> 38:30.773
  Get down on the ground!       

38:30.774 --> 38:32.474

38:32.475 --> 38:33.226
No, no.

You've got the wrong one.

          Think about this.     

38:35.679 --> 38:37.529
     I said get down.

38:47.007 --> 38:48.691

              You're just a boy.

38:57.751 --> 38:59.501
        I'm a soldier.          

38:59.502 --> 39:00.887
            And there are more  
             of us every day.   

39:00.888 --> 39:02.105
Let's go, soldier.

         Hey.

 Welcome back.                  

39:16.236 --> 39:17.236
            Yeah, thanks.       

39:17.237 --> 39:18.537
Everything go okay?

        Yeah, thank you.        

39:20.306 --> 39:22.942
          And thank you for     
     keeping an eye on Isabelle.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.477
Oh, well, it's not a problem.   

39:25.478 --> 39:27.013
I didn't really do much.        

39:28.181 --> 39:29.865
    Yeah, well,                 
    thank you anyway.           

39:30.634 --> 39:34.553
I worry about her.              

39:34.554 --> 39:36.222
        Well, you don't really  
            need to.            

39:36.223 --> 39:38.357
She seems to be getting along   
            really well.        

39:39.793 --> 39:41.861
  I'm her father,               
    it's my job.                

39:47.785 --> 39:49.719
 And it's harder with Isabelle. 

39:51.422 --> 39:54.590
    People see her,             
they see a woman.               

39:54.591 --> 39:55.691
    A beautiful woman.          

39:57.511 --> 39:59.212
And they might forget           

39:59.213 --> 40:00.680
that inside,                    
she's just a little girl.       

40:07.220 --> 40:12.491
  Still, I'm glad she has you   
    around...to be a friend.
