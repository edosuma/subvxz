00:07.775 --> 00:08.874
This is it!

00:08.876 --> 00:11.543
-High school!
-We're gonna own this place!

00:11.545 --> 00:12.611
This is it!

00:12.613 --> 00:14.913
-High school!

00:24.692 --> 00:27.192
You know, I'm glad we're here
together, Isadora.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.961
It gives me a feeling
which I can only describe as--

00:28.963 --> 00:30.129
Stuck?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.064
Isadora, Farkle finding
the one and only Smackle

00:32.066 --> 00:33.532
lets me know
the universe has order

00:33.534 --> 00:36.068
and our existence is not
just random coincidence.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.806
Hello, random
coincidence ladies!

00:42.309 --> 00:43.542
I thought they were you!

00:45.012 --> 00:46.578
Riles?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.213
What if we don't own this place?

00:48.215 --> 00:49.848
Maya, life wouldn't do that.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.916
We're us.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.553
Us are in Jurassic Park.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.726
Come on, they're just
people in high school.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.165
You know who goes
to our high school?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.232
Thor.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.737
I heard that even
the best of friendships

01:11.739 --> 01:13.072
can come apart
in high school.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.108
But that couldn't happen
to us, right?

01:16.110 --> 01:17.743
Promise me that
no matter what happens,

01:17.745 --> 01:18.944
we will always stick together.

Of course get in the hole.

I'm gonna call you?

02:58.345 --> 02:59.611
Spunky.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.013
And what are you, Spunky?

03:01.015 --> 03:04.283
Her name is Maya.
And you can call me Lucas.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.951
You wanna know
what I am?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.286
I'm as strong as a horse.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.620
I don't know how.
I just am.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.356
Yeah, he's not even with us.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.794
When my friends tell you
to do something,

03:15.796 --> 03:16.995
you do what they say.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.731
This hallway here is for people
who have earned it.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.966
Why are you doing this?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.301

03:22.303 --> 03:23.635

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237

04:06.513 --> 04:07.646
Do it.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.049
(grunts)

04:11.051 --> 04:13.218
You know we're not gonna
stay down here, right?

04:13.220 --> 04:15.287
You guys know
as soon you leave,
we're just gonna go to class.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.788
Oh, we want you to go to class.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.024
But spend your free time
down here because
of what Spunky said.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.626
What, "We were kings"?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.527
Yeah. In middle school,
you were.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.595
We all were.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.931
Right now, you're not.
We are.

04:25.933 --> 04:29.067
We walk anywhere we want
and you don't.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.869
Why? Because you say so?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.170
Yeah.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.107
Now get down there,
little buddy.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.377
You'll know when to come out.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.878
This is a service we perform.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.047
You don't have to thank us.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.882
Yeah, trust me, we won't.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.652
Trust me, you will.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.056
If there's nothing else,
we wish you good day.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.958
Good luck in high school.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.166
I'm sorry
we're in here, guys.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.734
It's not your fault, Lucas.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.202
You can't protect us.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.805
I used to.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.248
Is there a big difference
between first grade
and second grade?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.484
No. It's two plus two,
C-A-T, red, blue, green,

05:19.486 --> 05:21.119
nap time, juice.
You're good.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.588
That was preschool.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.457
You're in a dream world, lady.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.758
Stop growing up.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.926
You're my baby.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.028
Why do you kids
grow up so fast?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.534
My mother and father
are fighting again.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.102
I'm sorry, Ava.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.337
We'll take you to school, okay?

05:38.339 --> 05:39.938
Thanks.
Sign this.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.139
-Sure.
-Ah-ah!

05:41.141 --> 05:43.508
Sorry, I'm his mommy lawyer.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.911
Yeah-huh, yeah-huh.
He's not signing it!

05:48.115 --> 05:49.481
Why not?

05:49.483 --> 05:53.652
Because it says who gets what
if your marriage doesn't work.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.955
-What does she get?
-Everything.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.056
What do I get?

05:58.058 --> 05:59.958
The boxes everything came in.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.060
-Yay!
-No!

06:02.062 --> 06:05.364
Wait. Our marriage doesn't work?

06:05.366 --> 06:08.300
I was just going along
all dumb and happy.

06:08.302 --> 06:12.204
I put the best two years
of my life into this thing.

06:13.307 --> 06:16.641
(whining)
Where am I gonna find
somebody else at my age?

06:17.845 --> 06:21.213
Ava, you've been
hearing things, haven't you?

06:22.516 --> 06:23.648
Aww.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.020
Ava, is there a chance
you're not mad at me

06:29.022 --> 06:32.290
but at something else
going on in your life?

06:41.835 --> 06:43.769
Good morning and welcome
to World History.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.771
Who's ready to learn?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.339
What's that on the board?

06:47.341 --> 06:50.609
Cory: "We were Kings.
Now we're Patriots."

06:50.611 --> 06:53.078
Why does it say that?
It's cryptic.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.679
You can't teach us cryptic.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.515
What are you trying
to get away with? Huh?

06:59.353 --> 07:00.952
-I'll be right back.
-Student: Mm.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.754
-What's her name?
-What's your name?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.624
-Marly.
-Marly.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.325
Marly sees right through me.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.862
Just keep on teaching
about our lives,

07:10.864 --> 07:11.897
and she'll come around.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.866
Abigail Adams was the wife
of John Adams

07:14.868 --> 07:17.035
and the mama of Johnny Q.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.603
(chuckles)

07:18.605 --> 07:20.806
They were quite
the historical triangle.

07:20.808 --> 07:21.907
-Ha.
-Triangle.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.008
Ha.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.646
And I'll tell you that
the one thing they understood

07:27.648 --> 07:30.482
about this brand-new nation
was to stick together

07:30.484 --> 07:33.718
because every direction
they turned was brand-new,

07:33.720 --> 07:35.053
undiscovered country.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.656
I am an Abigail Adams Patriot.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.158
How? We don't even
get to walk in the hallways.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.794
Lucas, these seniors are older
and more experienced than us,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.262
and I think that
they're trying to help.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.165
Riley, they're making fun of us
and we're letting it happen.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.302
But most of all,
these patriots knew

07:50.304 --> 07:51.970
to remain loyal to each other

07:51.972 --> 07:54.105
because their survival
depended on it

07:54.107 --> 07:56.107
in a dangerous, new land.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.276
Riley, we don't even know
our way around the school yet.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.345
Why would we just park
ourselves in a hole?

08:00.347 --> 08:02.481
Okay, so you just want to throw
us into whatever goes on

08:02.483 --> 08:04.249
in this place
and just see what happens?

08:04.251 --> 08:07.652
Yes, because you know
what I call that? Normal.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.723
Let me see if I get
how you teach.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.793
My boyfriend
and I get into a fight--

08:14.795 --> 08:16.728
-Aww.
-I was talking about you.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.431
Uh, me? Why?

08:19.433 --> 08:20.765
Are we fighting?

08:20.767 --> 08:21.967
Oh, I don't know.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.668
Let's go to the weird,
undefined area

08:23.670 --> 08:25.337
between the two floors
and talk about it.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.872
We are fighting.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.607
You have to fight with him
exactly as much!

08:28.609 --> 08:29.941
-But I don't know what he--
-Do it!

08:29.943 --> 08:31.042
Okay!

08:32.346 --> 08:33.378
Huh-hurr!

08:33.380 --> 08:35.647
Huh-hurr! Huh-hurr!

08:35.649 --> 08:36.681
Huh-hurr?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.416
Huh-hurr huh-hurr! Huh-hurr!

08:42.656 --> 08:44.523
Who misses middle school?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.297
Okay, school's over.
Can we go home now?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.232
-Who wants a hug?
-Stop with that!

08:55.402 --> 08:57.736
This is not how
I'm gonna live
my high school life.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.171
What if there's a good reason
the seniors wanted us here?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.173
What if it's to teach
us something?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.842
What if you just have
too much faith in people?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.911
What if I have exactly
the right amount of faith
in people?

09:05.913 --> 09:06.978
Bird.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.014
How am I a triangle with that?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.382
Okay, you know what?
That's it.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.716
I'm going to look around.
Come on, Zay.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.220
They left?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.155
Maybe they have
the right idea.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.991
Yeah, I don't know what
we're supposed to be
learning down here.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.832
Okay, everybody!

09:27.834 --> 09:29.167
Follow me!

09:30.671 --> 09:33.572
Undiscovered country
in every direction.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.639
Riles!

09:39.046 --> 09:41.646
-I think this may
just turn out fine.
-(footsteps approaching)

09:42.849 --> 09:44.349
You're in our spot.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.452
This is where we sit.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.857
In the window?

09:52.859 --> 09:55.193
And you guys talk about life?

09:55.195 --> 09:58.196
-No. We sit in the window...
-And go like this.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.439
-Hi.
-What's your name?

10:08.575 --> 10:11.242
Lucas. And these are my...

10:11.244 --> 10:12.644
How would you like
to be called?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.379
Uh, girlfriend.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.714
And how would you like
to be called?

10:15.716 --> 10:18.383
Girlfriend
equally as much.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.652
Hi, my name is Zay.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.887
I'm completely available.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.056
Girlfriend-eses?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.591
It's complicated.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.060
You know what's not complicated?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.128
Zay.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.563
Available.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.933
Well, I'm sure
you're all adorable together.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.468
And thanks
for being a distraction

10:36.470 --> 10:38.069
until the football team
finished practice.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.938
I'm trying out for football.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.973
Yeah? Good luck to you.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.515
You're the football players
in high school?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.519
Hey, that's great.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.890
You're the cheerleaders
in high school?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.826
Hey, that's great.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.197
The scientists here
are gigantic.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.503
So you guys decided
to come upstairs, huh?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.705
You think you're ready
for the big time?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.611
Maybe not just yet.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.683
This is all your fault!

11:26.019 --> 11:27.052
Uh...

11:27.054 --> 11:28.119
What is?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.621
Things are going bad, man.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.022
We need somebody to blame.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.192
I am also feeling
these emotions!

11:35.962 --> 11:37.962
We've fallen
on hard times, Matthews.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.064
Fix it, sir.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.032
Bravo.
(chuckles)

11:42.536 --> 11:44.669
Wonderful performance.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.804
Shall we begin again?

11:45.806 --> 11:47.839
Lovely. What shall
we do differently?

11:47.841 --> 11:51.242
Well, um, this time,
I think I'd like to go first.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.878
Oh, by all means!
In five, four, three...

11:53.880 --> 11:54.913
You did this!

11:54.915 --> 11:56.047
Yikes!

11:56.049 --> 11:58.349
I was fine in middle school!

11:58.351 --> 12:00.018
I could've gone on
there forever,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.720
talking about
whatever I wanted,

12:01.722 --> 12:04.222
and you suckers believed
everything I said!

12:05.659 --> 12:08.226
But you had to bring me here.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.995
I gotta teach stuff now!

12:10.997 --> 12:13.998
That is not why
I got into this!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.167
Did you prepare us?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.502
What?

12:17.504 --> 12:19.938
Did you prepare us for this?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.539
We're not important,
Matthews.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.308
You always made
us feel important.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.544
You never prepared us
to be unimportant,

12:26.546 --> 12:28.179
and now we don't know
what to do.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.949
You didn't even go
to our school!

12:30.951 --> 12:33.518
But I'm here now
and I catch on fast.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.587
I wanna be in the triangle!

12:35.589 --> 12:37.756
-Smackle!
-What'd I say?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.357
We're not kings anymore.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.759
The seniors are the kings.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.027
-Are they good kings?
-No.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.963
We don't know that yet.
We don't know their reasoning.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.197
They don't have
a reason, Riley.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.732
They're just
putting us in a hole.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.934
Riley's looking for
the best in people, right?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.936
Yes. Would you tell her to stop?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.806
What's the matter, Lucas?

12:54.808 --> 12:57.575
It's not so easy
to protect 'em anymore, right?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.977
Don't look at me.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.046
All right.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.782
Let's see what we got.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.052
They want you to stay down here?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.621
Until we think
we're ready to leave.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.222
Well, why would they pick
just you guys out?

13:11.224 --> 13:14.159
Because we're freshmen
and they think that
we're easy targets.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.828
Yeah, but there's
a whole class of freshmen.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.797
Why do you think
they picked out just you?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.565
They said that
we'd thank them for this.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.000
We're never thanking them.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.235
Dad, would you tell him
that there's a purpose here?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.838
Mr. Matthews, will you please
tell her that they were
messing with us?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.006
This is on me.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.574
Mm? What?

13:29.576 --> 13:32.010
You were kids.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.313
I taught you to always look
for the lessons that life is
trying to teach you.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.282
Now you're not kids.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.251
It's day one in a bigger world.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.921
You've asked me
if I've prepared you for it.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.590
We'll see.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.428
-It's not just a hole.
-What is it then?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.264
-You don't have to get angry.
-I am angry, Riley.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.300
This isn't how
I want to start high school.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.135
I want to walk
anywhere I want.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.003
I want to go out
for the football team.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.506
Lucas, you'll get killed
on the football team.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.641
Whoa.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.610
Really?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.445
That's what you think?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.280
So, you'll put your faith
in some random seniors

14:09.282 --> 14:10.949
you just met,
but you don't have faith in me?

14:10.951 --> 14:13.551
I don't think
that they're random.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.354
I don't think that anything
that ever happens to us
is random.

14:17.858 --> 14:22.126
Sometimes you are
just too much for me, Riley.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.230
Guys, can we just calm down?

14:25.232 --> 14:26.631
This isn't who we are.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.199
Yeah?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.868
Who are we?

14:35.175 --> 14:38.743
I better-- You-- you know,
this is when he does something.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.848
You guys are the geniuses.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.250
You got this all figured out?

14:45.252 --> 14:46.851
Your dad's right.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.987
You do always look
for the good in people, Riley.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.922
You were a great leader
in middle school, Riley.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.490
You always made us believe
the world loved us.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.925
This just isn't
the same world.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.829
What if this one just
doesn't love us as much?

14:57.831 --> 15:00.098
No matter how optimistic
you are, Riley,

15:00.100 --> 15:02.934
I think this time,
you just led us down a hole.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.348
You sure you still
wanna know me?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.920
Always.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.796
Can I move in with you?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.197
It's only fair.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.466
You were gonna move in
with me and Auggie someday.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.370
Ava, things aren't any better
with your parents?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.707
Tell me the truth.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.442
Is this my fault?

15:45.545 --> 15:46.945
No.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.380
Of course not.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.816
No, of course not.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.653
Ava, sometimes
people just don't get along,

15:55.655 --> 15:57.555
even when they really
love each other.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.625
They don't seem like
they love each other
very much right now.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.929
Thank you for sitting
with me, Auggie.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.732
Thank you for sitting
with me, Topanga.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.468
You're being real
grown-up about this.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.637
Growing up is hard.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.173
You're being
a real baby about this.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.842
High school is hard.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.377
Switch!

16:24.284 --> 16:25.783
I miss first grade.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.418
Life was easier then.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.654
I am right here
for you, Auggie.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.322
Thank you, Mom.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.224
Why do people fight?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.461
Because people grow, Ava.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.497
And when you grow,
you change.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.500
Like from first grade
to second grade?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.470
Or from middle school
to high school.

16:45.472 --> 16:49.374
Or moms and dads,
because they change too.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.509
What do I do?

16:52.645 --> 16:54.512
You hope for the best in people.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.282
I teach that to everybody
I care about.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.752
Even when things seem real bad?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.956
Even when it seems like
you're standing in a hole.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.291
You're a good teacher,
aren't you?

17:07.293 --> 17:10.628
Stupid Marly doesn't think so.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.132
Well, she's wrong.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.901
I'm gonna go back home
and hope for the best.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.469
Good luck, honey.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.246
-So you goin' back in tomorrow?
-(door opens)

17:28.248 --> 17:30.048
-Yeah.
-(door closes)

17:30.050 --> 17:31.816
I'm gonna hope for the best.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.651
You keep doing
what you do, Cory.

17:34.821 --> 17:35.853
You sure, Topanga?

17:35.855 --> 17:38.222
I've always been sure.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.491
Except for four times.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.927
It may have been more
than four times.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.663
It's definitely more
than four times.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.465
It was 50,000 times.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.108
-I can't think.
-I know.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.509
They're not gonna
show up, are they?

17:58.511 --> 17:59.577
No.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.846
We do our homework here
every night together.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.114
Yeah.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.617
They're actually upset with me.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.419
The fight I had
with Lucas was real.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.189
Is this happening?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.723
It's the first day
of high school

18:12.725 --> 18:14.125
and we thought that
we were so ready.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.760
I told you we shouldn't go.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.864
Friendships can come apart
in high school.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.434
I guess I just never thought
that it could actually
really happen to us.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.472
How stupid was I to trust
people I don't even know?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.540
Senior:
Not stupid.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.008
You.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.381
Why would you guys
do this to us?

18:37.383 --> 18:38.883
Our friends left, you know.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.418
Yeah, that's what happens.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.552
People leave.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.221
So, what,
you're following us now?

18:43.223 --> 18:45.056
No.
(chuckles)

18:45.058 --> 18:46.991
You're following us, actually.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.727
-Yeah, we're in here
all of the time.
-This is our place.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.629
How come
we never noticed you?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.097
Because you guys
have been stuck

18:53.099 --> 18:55.066
in your own little world
all this time.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.068
Now you want to grow up
and join ours?

18:57.070 --> 19:00.171
You guys have to stop
and look around more.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.740
That's why
we put you down there.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.076
Don't jump so fast.
Look around.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.913
Are you guys good people
or are you just messing
with us?

19:08.915 --> 19:10.081
Just tell us that.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.150
Well, we're definitely
messing with you.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.453
But we like to believe
we're good people.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.656
You know, you guys will just
have to figure that out, okay?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.525
Not okay.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.263
I don't believe in you.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.532
But I do believe in her.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.601
Thanks for coming.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.170
Hope you find another project.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.544
Hey.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.846
Look, I spoke to everybody.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.114
I know we were
supposed to be here.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.016
Everyone is just
a little upset.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.051
You know, you kind of ruined
our first day of high school.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.221
So, we all just did
our homework at home tonight.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.157
Farkle, I'm upset with you.

19:53.159 --> 19:54.559
And I'm upset with you.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.360
This is how
a real fight begins.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.362
No, I actually think
we're in one right now.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.465
Hey, we're not the ones
who made high school harder
than we thought it was gonna be.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.301
And we're not the ones
who trusted complete strangers.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.236
I believe in people,
Farkle, and you know that.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.605
Maybe this will
teach you not to.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.074
Okay.

20:13.146 --> 20:14.912
You tell them that
it doesn't matter

20:14.914 --> 20:17.548
if you think standing
in a hole is stupid.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.617
What matters is us, Farkle.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.886
We don't leave.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.490
And I'm gonna go back
in that stupid hole tomorrow,

20:26.492 --> 20:28.559
and I don't know
what I'm going to learn.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.529
Because I believe that
I'm gonna come out

20:31.531 --> 20:33.731
knowing more
than I do now.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.903
And I hope I'm making
the right choice, Farkle.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.405
I hope my friends will
be there right with me.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.075
You tell them that.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.287
They'll come.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.261
They'll be here.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.996
(bell rings)

21:22.548 --> 21:23.881
He left.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.449
My dad left.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.652
Ava, I'm so sorry.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.387
I've been speaking
with your mom.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.822
It's just me and her now.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.257
I can't believe it.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.792
I'll help you.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.463
Thanks, but I don't think
you can.

21:40.566 --> 21:43.801
Who can I talk to
who knows how to do this?

21:44.904 --> 21:46.304
I just heard.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.744
What happens next, Maya?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.914
When people you've loved
all of your life

21:56.916 --> 21:59.050
suddenly decide to leave?

22:01.087 --> 22:03.621
Well, you sit
by yourself for a while

22:03.623 --> 22:05.222
and you'll try
to figure it out.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.893
And you'll blame yourself.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.696
But it isn't your fault.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.266
You probably
won't believe that, though,

22:15.268 --> 22:18.135
and you'll think
you did something wrong, but...

22:18.137 --> 22:20.071
you didn't.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.573
It isn't your fault.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.846
Most of all...

22:31.017 --> 22:33.184
you stay with your best friend.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.132
People make
their own decisions.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.870
And sometimes, they decide
to go away for a while.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.475
And sometimes, it takes time
to understand why.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.410
It isn't your fault.
