I think you're in love with me.
<i>[ Victoria ]</i>
<i>What?</i>

12:37.945 --> 12:40.647
I know that your friendship
with Mary makes it
kind of prohibitive, but--

I'm not leaving, Victoria.
Come on.

pretending, all right?

12:48.951 --> 12:50.819
Robert, please,
let go of me.

12:50.886 --> 12:53.621
Is this part of a game, huh?
This denial? Is this what
arouses you?

12:53.688 --> 12:58.456
Robert, look, I'll ask you
one more time to let go of me
and then I scream.

12:58.523 --> 13:00.391
But he wouldn't.

13:02.358 --> 13:04.293
He wouldn't let go.

13:04.359 --> 13:07.261
Maybe I should just take you,
huh? Then we could both
have each other.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.129
You'd be spared the
morning-after remorse, huh?

the other shots.

13:45.147 --> 13:48.816

<i>pulling the trigger.</i>

13:51.818 --> 13:53.919
But not how many times.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.322
Your story seems so traumatic,
Ms. Keenan.

14:00.388 --> 14:03.624
- I'm a little struck
by how poised you tell it.
- Objection!

14:03.690 --> 14:06.826
- Overruled.
- You talk about
an attempted rape,

14:06.892 --> 14:09.927
then shooting a man repeatedly
to his death.

14:09.993 --> 14:12.495
And you seem so
unaffected by it all.

14:12.562 --> 14:14.896
- Objection.
- Sustained.

14:14.963 --> 14:19.065
It's your testimony the victim
came over to your apartment
alone on many occasions.

14:19.132 --> 14:21.166
Yes.
Sometimes late at night.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.300
- Yes.
- And it's your testimony...

14:23.367 --> 14:26.702
- that there was nothing
sexual between you two.
- That's correct.

14:26.769 --> 14:31.272
In the last, say,
oh, five years,

14:31.339 --> 14:33.840
have you had a romantic
relationship with anybody?

14:33.906 --> 14:36.808
As a matter of fact,
no, I-I haven't.

14:36.875 --> 14:40.209
Gee. Such an attractive,
affluent woman,

14:40.276 --> 14:42.210
you would think
there'd have to be somebody.

14:42.277 --> 14:44.779
- Objection!
- Ms. Gamble.

14:44.846 --> 14:48.013
You testified that
you screamed that night.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.349
Anybody hear those screams
to your knowledge?

14:50.415 --> 14:52.616
- No, not to my knowledge.
- Oh.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.784
<i>- The walls of my apartment</i>
<i>are very thick.</i>
<i>- You would know this?</i>

14:55.851 --> 14:58.086
- Objection!
- Overruled.

Have you ever screamed
in the company of the victim
before and not been detected?

15:01.054 --> 15:04.656
- Objection!
- Sustained. Stop it.

15:04.722 --> 15:09.592
Did Mr. Adler keep pursuing you
after you shot him
the first time?

15:10.759 --> 15:13.361
I-- I don't really remember.

15:13.427 --> 15:16.028
I recall
squeezing the trigger...

15:17.229 --> 15:19.430
and then seeing him
lying on the floor.

15:19.497 --> 15:22.999
- You don't remember
seeing him fall?
- I was in shock, Ms. Gamble.

15:23.066 --> 15:26.433
I don't remember a lot of
what happened that night.
I was shaking.

15:26.501 --> 15:29.202
Do you remember dialing 911?
When?
Yes.

15:29.269 --> 15:32.103
- Right after.
- Right after.
Seconds after? Minutes?

15:32.170 --> 15:37.406
Immediately after. I saw him
lying on the floor. I picked up
the phone and called.

15:37.473 --> 15:40.808
- While you were
still shaking?
- Yes.

15:40.875 --> 15:46.344
At this time, Your Honor,
I'd like to play the recording
of the 911 call.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.414
[ Man ]
Say that again, please.

15:51.481 --> 15:53.482
[ Victoria ]
A man just tried to rape me.

15:53.548 --> 15:56.983
I shot him in self-defense,
and I think he might be dead.

15:57.049 --> 15:58.850
[ Man ]
Where are you
calling from, ma'am?

15:58.917 --> 16:02.752
[ Victoria ] I'm at
the Devonshire Place, apartment
14-C. It's my residence.

16:02.820 --> 16:06.021
[ Player Stops ]
That's the sound
of your voice in shock?

16:06.088 --> 16:08.422
I don't know
what I sound like.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.591
I do know
I was in shock, yes.
I see.

16:11.657 --> 16:15.226
So while in shock, you had
the presence to assert your
legal claim of self-defense?

16:15.293 --> 16:17.427
- Objection.
- Overruled.

16:17.494 --> 16:19.328
Shall I play the tape again,
Ms. Keenan?

16:19.395 --> 16:21.629
I said self-defense
as a descriptive way.

16:21.696 --> 16:25.932
I wasn't asserting
any legal claim, Ms. Gamble.
It just came out that way.

16:25.999 --> 16:29.166
It just came out that way.

16:36.837 --> 16:39.706
I think you did great.
I really do.

16:39.772 --> 16:42.640
You heard that tape.

16:42.707 --> 16:44.608
I did sound calm, Bobby.
I did.

16:44.674 --> 16:48.276
You sounded shut down.
That's normal under
the circumstances.

16:48.343 --> 16:51.112
I think we had
a very good day, Vicky.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.514
<i>I wouldn't say so</i>
<i>if I thought otherwise.</i>

16:56.848 --> 16:58.516
What?

16:58.582 --> 17:03.184
I remember pulling the trigger
on the first shot, but--

17:03.251 --> 17:08.421
but maybe the reason I can't
remember the other four shots
is because I blocked it out.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.923
Maybe they were deliberate,
and that's why
I blocked them out.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.089
Don't start going
down that path.

17:14.156 --> 17:17.157
Look, I don't know anymore.
When I was testifying,
I could see the image--

17:20.393 --> 17:24.895
Maybe those last four shots,
maybe they were revenge.

17:24.962 --> 17:28.464
Listen to me.
The man tried to rape you.

17:29.932 --> 17:32.166
He might have killed you.

17:35.268 --> 17:37.702
The first shot was fear,
I think.

17:39.037 --> 17:42.204
The other four were rage.

17:45.206 --> 17:47.174
Least she's honest.

17:47.241 --> 17:49.442
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

17:49.508 --> 17:53.811
Bobby, either way,
it wasn't premeditated.
So what it's rage?

17:53.878 --> 17:57.412
What woman
under those circumstances
wouldn't just start shooting?

17:59.914 --> 18:01.915
Yeah.

18:01.982 --> 18:07.051
This ain't bothering you
'cause it's a client.
You love this woman?

18:09.253 --> 18:12.487
Ah, come on.
It's too soon.

18:16.322 --> 18:20.291
Do you think that
I should let Eugene take over?

18:20.358 --> 18:23.693
No. That sends a message
to the jury.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.528
Besides, Eugene says
you're doing good in there.

18:26.595 --> 18:28.463
He thinks you're winning.

18:32.831 --> 18:35.299
You're worried.

I don't know, Jimmy.
I don't know.

18:40.635 --> 18:42.970
Wh-What is it about her?

18:43.036 --> 18:45.438
I mean,
I know she's attractive,

18:45.505 --> 18:49.840
but your valve in this area
has been kind of shut off.

18:49.907 --> 18:52.308
Exactly.

18:54.809 --> 18:59.512
I don't have a clue
as to what makes her different.

19:01.413 --> 19:05.115
It's not like I'm in--
in love with her, Jimmy.

19:05.182 --> 19:07.316
But it could go that way.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.252
Maybe I should have
Eugene take over.

19:17.822 --> 19:20.956
All right, this is how I see it.
He promised her
he'd leave the wife,

19:21.023 --> 19:22.924
and when he doesn't,
she shoots him.

19:22.991 --> 19:26.459
See, she was in love with him.
Don't you think she'd have
a plan slightly better...

19:26.526 --> 19:28.560
than gunning him down
in her own apartment?

19:28.627 --> 19:31.396
What do you mean?
It's a great plan.
No witnesses, reasonable doubt.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.997

I do.

19:34.063 --> 19:36.364

See, she did it.

19:57.042 --> 19:59.210
Actually,
I am here to help you.

19:59.276 --> 20:02.245
I live in the apartment
across from Victoria Keenan,

20:02.312 --> 20:05.747
and I have some information
on that night.

20:05.814 --> 20:10.316
Okay, I won't waste your time,
because I know that you must be
running at a premium here.

20:10.382 --> 20:13.718
Here is the thing.
I am a security nut.

20:13.784 --> 20:16.385
I, um, live alone, and I have
a recurrent nightmare...

20:16.452 --> 20:20.321
that someone gets into my house
and gives me a tracheotomy.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.256
So I got into this high-tech
security stuff, right,

20:23.323 --> 20:25.890
including mini cameras
and so forth.

20:25.957 --> 20:30.292

I wonder if it picked
something up that night?

20:30.359 --> 20:33.261
<i>And sure enough--</i>

20:33.328 --> 20:36.596
You want to take
a little look at this?

of the shooting?

<i>Since the night of,</i>
<i>I told you.</i>

to go to the police with it?

I couldn't think
of much else.

21:28.657 --> 21:31.458
But I couldn't see
much good in it.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.993
At least, not much
good in it for me.

21:34.060 --> 21:39.529
And then this morning-- ding.
Timing is everything,
don't you think?

21:39.596 --> 21:45.432
<i>I am willing to sell this</i>
<i>to your client for 100,000.</i>

<i>Hey, you know,</i>
<i>that's a legal term,</i>
<i>and I am not a lawyer.</i>

that you're gonna buy
what I have to sell.

21:57.505 --> 21:59.873
Well, you came
to the wrong place.

Because this office
doesn't participate
in blackmail or extortion!

22:05.642 --> 22:09.711
Okay, again,
I'm no legal expert.

22:09.778 --> 22:14.214
But you do have some duty to
take this offer to your client.

22:14.281 --> 22:16.815
The tape is yours.
It's a copy.

22:19.349 --> 22:21.685
Oh, you know what?

22:21.751 --> 22:26.887
Since you say it's illegal,
maybe I should just go
to the D.A.

22:26.953 --> 22:32.256
But you should probably think
that if the district attorney
springs that in court tomorrow,

22:32.323 --> 22:35.325
you'll be hard-pressed
to claim unfair surprise...

22:35.392 --> 22:39.194
since I came to you first.

22:41.061 --> 22:46.030
Mr. Walters, you had to know
about this tape the night
of the shooting,

have known to save it.

So the police
questioned you.

You withheld evidence.

of justice, Mr. Walters.

I lied. I told them
that we were friends.

Why didn't you tell me?
I was going to, but you
basically told me not to.

23:47.896 --> 23:52.098
What?
Our very first meeting,
I remember your words exactly.

23:52.165 --> 23:54.533
You said that
whatever I told you,
you were stuck with it.

23:54.599 --> 23:58.301
You couldn't get me on
the witness stand and say things
that you knew weren't true.

23:58.368 --> 24:01.070
That didn't mean lie.
Bobby, don't deny it.

24:01.137 --> 24:04.004
You're the one that steered me
to stick with the version
I gave the police.

24:04.071 --> 24:07.740
I never told you to lie.
Because we both know
you're not allowed to.

24:07.806 --> 24:10.275
But you sure as hell warned me
against the truth.

24:10.342 --> 24:14.777
His shrink took the stand,
for God's sakes. How could you
be so sure he wouldn't know?

24:14.844 --> 24:18.012
Because Robert told me
that he never told him.

24:18.079 --> 24:20.947
He was afraid
for anybody to know.

24:21.013 --> 24:23.749
The D.A. was exactly right.

24:25.950 --> 24:29.485
Robert didn't tell
his psychiatrist because
he didn't want him telling Mary.

24:29.552 --> 24:33.153
So you just murdered this guy?
No, of course
I didn't murder him!

Robert came by here...

24:41.491 --> 24:44.392
and said that he wanted to
leave Mary and marry me.

24:44.459 --> 24:47.361
I had no interest
in marrying him.

24:47.427 --> 24:49.495
So I turned him down.

24:50.963 --> 24:54.765
Then that night he came back,
he proposed again.

24:54.831 --> 24:57.532
I said no again,
and then he went into this rage.

24:57.599 --> 25:01.034
And the rest is exactly
as I told you before.

I went for the gun
and I shot him.
