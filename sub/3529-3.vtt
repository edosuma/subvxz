00:01.000 --> 00:02.960
<i>Previously on "The Tudors"</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:05.922
The great part of the North have risen
in sudden rebellion against His Majesty.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.590
I'm appointing you commander
of the Royal forces,

00:08.625 --> 00:10.360
These rebels are traitors, Charles

00:10.395 --> 00:11.755
They must be punished,

00:11.790 --> 00:13.035
Why will you not speak to me?

00:13.070 --> 00:14.920
I'm disappointed because
you're not yet with child.

00:15.021 --> 00:16.721
That’s all

00:16.870 --> 00:20.140
Lady Misseldon, do your duties
honourably and virtuously

00:20.175 --> 00:21.982
Poor you, Your Majesty.

00:22.017 --> 00:23.755
The Lady Mary Tudor.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.555
May I present you to Her Majesty Queen Jane?

00:26.590 --> 00:30.610
Mary, it gives more pleasure than I can say to
see you reconciled with your father.

00:30.645 --> 00:31.935
Darcy and York have betrayed me?

00:31.970 --> 00:36.445
I'll teach these bastard ingrates
a fearful bloody lesson in slaughter!

00:36.480 --> 00:40.920
If you are as true and loyal as you say,
then you can prove it to us

00:40.955 --> 00:43.852
By giving over your Captain
Mr. Aske into our hands.

00:43.887 --> 00:46.750
That I will not do.
For what is a man but his promise

00:46.785 --> 00:49.475
And His Holiness prays that King Henry would

00:49.510 --> 00:52.270
grasp this divine opportunity
for reconciliation.

00:52.305 --> 00:54.477
And perhaps you yourself Father Pole

00:54.512 --> 00:56.681
might considering returning to England.

00:56.716 --> 00:58.815
In order to influence events there.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.480
I beg you to restore and keep the abbeys.

01:00.515 --> 01:02.085
I've told you once before:

01:02.120 --> 01:03.725
don't to meddle with my affairs.

01:03.760 --> 01:07.140
You have my permission to prolong
the truce for as long as necessary.

01:07.175 --> 01:08.347
What should I tell them?

01:08.382 --> 01:09.485
Tell them what you like.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.820
The more His Majesty understands
the causes of this uprising,

01:11.855 --> 01:14.095
the more is he persuaded to show clemency.

01:14.130 --> 01:17.720
And the King is still willing to
offer a general pardon?

01:17.755 --> 01:21.955
They are not all to be pardoned.
Not the leaders.

01:21.990 --> 01:26.300
I want them brought to you still,
with halters around their necks!

01:26.335 --> 01:28.875
"My trusty and well beloved Aske.

01:28.910 --> 01:31.520
we have conceived a great
desire to speak with you..."

~ Season 3 - Episode 3 ~
"Dissension and Punishment"

03:46.620 --> 03:48.700
How in God's name are we
suppose to banish idolatry

03:48.735 --> 03:50.780
and superstition and empty
ritual from our churches

03:50.815 --> 03:54.890
when they are still practiced here at court.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.555
When shall I meet the Majesty, my lord?

04:05.590 --> 04:09.715
Very soon. Majesty is most
eager to talk to you.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.040
In the meantime, he encouraged you
to write a lengthy declaration of

04:13.075 --> 04:16.510
everything you did during the rebellion
and the reasons for it.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.420
Keep still.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.840
Who are you? What are you doing here?

05:01.875 --> 05:03.025
You can't be here.

05:03.060 --> 05:08.110
Oh my God, it's true. I didn't believe it.

05:08.145 --> 05:09.675
Get out. Get out.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.980
No. She is my fiancée.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.990
- Well, should I...?
- No, I don't...

05:16.025 --> 05:17.210
There's no cause being here.

05:20.430 --> 05:21.975
I warned you.

05:22.010 --> 05:23.670
Is he alive?

05:23.705 --> 05:25.330
Master Holbein.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.750
- Master Holbein.
- Your Majesty.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.030
I must beg Your Majesty's pardon.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.100
Pardon? What for?

05:34.740 --> 05:39.450
I have committed an assault
within the verge of your court.

05:39.485 --> 05:45.255
An assault? you? But you're an artist.

05:45.290 --> 05:49.220
I was painting the picture of Lady Misseldon
that Your Majesty commissioned,

05:49.255 --> 05:52.310
but a gentleman interrupted us.

05:52.345 --> 05:53.355
What did you do?

05:53.390 --> 05:58.600
I threw the gentleman into some shelves.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.670
You did the right thing, Master Holbein.

06:07.210 --> 06:11.410
And I'll forgive you freely;
I might have done the same thing myself.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.450
Just finish the portrait. I can't wait.

06:16.485 --> 06:18.000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

06:18.035 --> 06:19.740
Master Holbein.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.200
Sir Robert Tavistock.

06:29.230 --> 06:32.490
- Sir Robert, you look out of sorts.
- Your Majesty

06:32.525 --> 06:35.750
I have a great complaint to
make against Master Holbein.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.540
I am engaged to a young woman.

06:38.990 --> 06:42.700
but found him painting her. Naked.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.255
Naked?

06:45.290 --> 06:49.980
Yes, Your Majesty.
On a bed, like some concubine.

06:51.060 --> 06:55.270
I demanded that, Your Majesty,
punish Mr. Holbein severely, for his lewdness,

06:55.305 --> 06:59.327
his immorality, and his violence against me.

06:59.362 --> 07:03.350
You have not to do with Mr Holbein,
but with me.

07:03.385 --> 07:04.810
I tell you frankly.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.870
If I have seven peasants,
I can make seven lords.

07:08.900 --> 07:13.820
but if I have seven lords,
I couldn't make one Holbein.

07:14.830 --> 07:19.820
Then tell me truthfully,
do you still wish me to punish Mr. Holbein?

07:19.855 --> 07:23.187
No, Your Majesty.
I ask for Your Majesty's pardon.

07:23.222 --> 07:26.520
I am Your Majesty's humble
and obedient servant,

07:26.555 --> 07:29.630
and make no complaints against Mr. Holbein.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.010
Good lad.

07:34.210 --> 07:35.940
Happy Christmas, Robert.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.765
- Majesty?
- Sweetheart.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.050
May I present someone to you?

07:55.085 --> 07:56.110
Very well.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.880
The Countess of Salisbury
was my old governess

08:00.915 --> 08:03.790
I know. I know the Lady very well.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.720
- Lady Margaret?
- Your Majesty.

08:06.755 --> 08:08.885
You are very welcome here at court.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.170
I know how rarely you quit your fine house.

08:11.205 --> 08:12.165
It is true.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.400
I prefer to live a life based on piety
and traditional ways, Your Majesty.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.230
You're an example to everyone here at court.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.050
How was your son, Reginald Pole?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.987
Is he still studying in Italy?

08:24.022 --> 08:26.041
Yes, indeed, Your Majesty.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.025
He is now at Padua University,

08:28.060 --> 08:32.110
and has more reasons than most
to be grateful to Your Majesty.

08:32.145 --> 08:37.270
Since until very recently,
you continue to pay his fees.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.025
I showed great interest in him.

08:44.059 --> 08:47.670
He showed great promise as scholar,
as well as being my cousin,

08:47.705 --> 08:50.280
Still, when you refused my offer
to make him the youngest

08:50.315 --> 08:52.692
ever Bishop of Winchester.

08:52.727 --> 08:55.070
I remember I had to thump him.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.730
Your Majesty must believe it was
not ingratitude on Reginald's part. No, no.

09:01.765 --> 09:05.500
He was in tears after leaving
Your Majesty's presence.

09:05.535 --> 09:09.855
The truth is my son is too much of a scholar

09:09.890 --> 09:14.780
and private person ever to
desire public office or notoriety.

09:14.815 --> 09:18.620
Then after all, I forgive him.

09:21.130 --> 09:23.960
- Majesty.
- Lady Salisbury.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.180
Are you ladies conspiring something.

09:46.240 --> 09:50.280
We were both like to present someone else
to Your Majesty at this Christmastide.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.090
Very well.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.675
Your Majesty, this is...

10:08.710 --> 10:13.180
My daughter Elizabeth.
You don't need to tell me.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.990
Come here, child.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.740
<i>Votre Majeste.</i>

10:30.775 --> 10:32.645
<i>ca va</i>

10:32.680 --> 10:35.650
<i>ca va bien, ma petite.</i>

10:35.685 --> 10:37.580
<i>venez ici</i>

10:41.170 --> 10:45.430
<i>attention</i>

10:51.820 --> 10:53.640
<i>Je suis on famille</i>

11:03.170 --> 11:06.590
Your Majesty, Mr. Robert Aske.

11:22.230 --> 11:26.620
- Majesty.
- Mr. Aske.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.275
Come.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.250
I am very glad to see you, Mr. Aske.

11:44.150 --> 11:46.935
For a long time, I believed
I was badly misinformed

11:46.970 --> 11:50.330
about the causes of disturbances in
the Northern part of our kingdom.

11:50.365 --> 11:53.702
but I have read your full
and frank explanation.

11:53.737 --> 11:57.040
I am persuaded by the justice of your cause.

11:58.030 --> 12:02.050
I esteem the commonwealth of the realm,
and love of my subjects,

12:02.085 --> 12:05.505
Mr. Aske, far more than any riches

12:05.540 --> 12:08.960
I'm truly humbled by Your Majesty's words.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.055
and ask in all you ability.

12:11.090 --> 12:16.830
If your sacred Majesty intends to fulfil
those pledges made in Your Majesty's name,

12:16.865 --> 12:21.452
by his grace,
the Duke of Suffolk at Pontefract.

12:21.487 --> 12:25.178
In every part,
the general and liberal pardon

12:25.213 --> 12:28.870
shall be extended to
all our Northern subjects.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.890
There will be a free election to a
Parliament to be held at York.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.670
when members of churchmen
without our displeasure,

12:37.690 --> 12:41.420
shall them may speak and show their
learning and their free minds.

12:41.455 --> 12:45.380
Furthermore, after my Lord Suffolk
has come down to you

12:45.415 --> 12:47.445
with the great seal to claim on this,

12:47.480 --> 12:51.310
then to show the great love we
bear on the Northern subjects.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.750
we ourselves shall come to York.

12:55.970 --> 13:00.640
and it is there, Mr. Aske,
where my Queen shall be crowned.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.520
Your Majesty is truly gracious.

13:05.250 --> 13:09.080
I swear to you. You will find no
more loving and loyal people

13:09.115 --> 13:11.360
on the whole of your realm
than Northern Yorkshire.

13:13.060 --> 13:17.850
One more thing. You've written
against some of my advisors,

13:17.885 --> 13:20.820
and protesting at their lack of noble blood.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.675
Your Majesty, I...

13:22.710 --> 13:29.800
No, I agree with you.
But don't say anything.

13:32.570 --> 13:35.680
Now, I have a gift for you.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.830
Majesty, I...

13:57.630 --> 14:00.580
Happy Christmas, Mr. Aske.

14:29.810 --> 14:31.650
That was quite entertaining.

14:40.090 --> 14:42.260
but you don't even know who I am, do you?

14:43.660 --> 14:44.920
Of course, I do.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.770
You're Edward Seymour's wife.

14:48.450 --> 14:51.080
If he ever discovered us,
he'd probably kill you.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.000
Really? Yet he seems so nice.

14:56.830 --> 15:00.840
Cold, perhaps but pleasant with all?

15:03.250 --> 15:06.940
That's a mistake they all make.

15:11.490 --> 15:19.010
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum, Amen

15:26.360 --> 15:27.700
Mr. Aske.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.060
Lady Mary.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.320
I'm sorry to disturb your prayers.

15:42.350 --> 15:46.870
Not at all, since you are
always a part of them.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.950
I come only to wish you well you, Mr. Aske.

15:49.985 --> 15:52.470
For I know you are here upon God's work.

15:53.170 --> 15:57.030
I trust the King's Majesty will grant
you and your people all their desires.

15:57.065 --> 15:58.675
I have every hope now,

15:58.710 --> 16:03.420
as I have ever hoped one day you will
succeed as Queen of England,

16:03.455 --> 16:06.220
for the better maintaining of our faith.

16:06.650 --> 16:08.480
Lady, you must know,

16:09.030 --> 16:11.585
how beloved you are to the people,

16:11.620 --> 16:16.020
as was your mother before you.
God rest her soul.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.261
Remember me by this.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.137
May God bless and keep you, Master Aske.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.265
How's father? They told me he has fallen ill

16:48.300 --> 16:55.180
I was going tell you at a better time.
Father is dead.

16:58.190 --> 17:03.875
Dead? When? Why?

17:03.910 --> 17:07.520
Keep smiling. A week ago.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.625
- A week?
- Yes a week.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.680
I arranged the funeral,
everything has done to honour him.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.790
You should have told me.
I should have been there.

17:21.825 --> 17:24.994
I wish I could be otherwise, but can't now,

17:25.030 --> 17:28.280
your place is here,
you have to understand that.

17:28.315 --> 17:34.780
Later you can visit his mausoleum

17:34.815 --> 17:38.850
- Sister.
- My Lady.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.110
I presume you have told her
about her father, is she alright

17:50.145 --> 17:53.300
Of course. She's the Queen.

17:55.080 --> 18:01.655
Gentlemen. Noble and worshipful
man of this country.

18:01.690 --> 18:05.810
I swear by the faith that I bear to
God and St. George that I have not only

18:05.845 --> 18:09.930
forgiven and pardoned the men 
of the North by writing under seal

18:09.965 --> 18:14.025
but also freely in my heart.

18:14.060 --> 18:17.410
It is my honour that those men now
wear the cross of St. George

18:17.445 --> 18:20.735
who thankfully accepted my free pardon

18:20.770 --> 18:26.580
and mean to be as loyal subjects,
as they were before their sorry insurrection.

18:28.970 --> 18:34.880
And my Queen and I, wish you all,
a very happy and prosperous New Year.

18:36.560 --> 18:41.300
I tell you frankly,
the King is a good and gracious lord

18:41.330 --> 18:46.110
who has granted us as far as he may,
all our desires and petitions.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.405
It's true. I heard it from his own mouth

18:49.440 --> 18:52.020
that he intends to hold a free
and fair parliament in York

18:52.055 --> 18:54.575
and have the Queen crowned there.

18:54.610 --> 18:57.040
Promises, Mr. Aske, just more promises.

18:57.075 --> 18:58.785
No, not just promises.

18:58.820 --> 19:03.515
Lord Suffolk is sworn to come here
to bring both great authority,

19:03.550 --> 19:07.505
the King's seal and thus he told
me many comfortable answers.

19:07.540 --> 19:11.460
I have to tell you, Mr. Aske,
though it grieves me to do so,

19:11.495 --> 19:14.675
that since you have been away,

19:14.710 --> 19:17.400
there have been many rumours 
and a widespread

19:17.435 --> 19:20.065
mistrust of the King and his council.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.410
Aye. The Northern lands
are open mustering again

19:22.445 --> 19:24.720
and this time we won't be betrayed.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.395
Tell them to believe me, John.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.840
Tell them to wait for the
coming of Lord Suffolk,

19:31.875 --> 19:34.215
for another rising now risks everything.

19:34.250 --> 19:38.920
Robert, there was a time
when nothing was more sure

19:38.955 --> 19:43.565
than a promise of a prince, but now

19:43.600 --> 19:48.510
we think these promises nothing
but a policy to blind the people.

19:48.545 --> 19:53.420
and when we rise again,
we will trust no promises.

19:53.455 --> 19:55.365
I cannot believe this.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.170
If you will not trust the King,
then will you at least trust me?

19:59.205 --> 20:02.745
Have I not guided you well so far?

20:02.780 --> 20:04.745
Have I not secured a pardon for all of us?

20:04.780 --> 20:10.210
But have you secured the King's absolute
promise to restore our monasteries?

20:10.700 --> 20:13.630
His Grace promised me that all
those matters would be discussed

20:13.665 --> 20:16.525
freely and openly in parliament.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.190
I trust him. He offered me as
much as true and honest

20:20.225 --> 20:23.820
and good man could
desire of their sovereign.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.250
but we have no proof.

20:31.410 --> 20:32.580
Where are you going?

20:32.615 --> 20:33.715
Marching on Carlisle.

20:33.750 --> 20:37.340
John, I plead with you, for the love of God,
not to put this agreement

20:37.375 --> 20:40.895
in jeopardy by false actions
and rush judgements.

20:40.930 --> 20:45.380
Their minds are already made up, Mr. Aske.
Even before you returned.

20:45.415 --> 20:48.710
There is no agreement just
base and empty promises.

20:49.760 --> 20:53.310
The King will not be moved
by words but by actions.

20:53.930 --> 20:56.700
We shall do now,
what we should have done before.

20:58.030 --> 20:59.890
gather the men.

21:09.740 --> 21:14.830
I wish the Lady Mary lived at the court.
I miss her very much.

21:14.865 --> 21:17.635
Yes, and Lady Elizabeth.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.510
Is she not the sweetest,
cleverest, brightest child?

21:21.800 --> 21:24.275
It's not have been easy for either of them.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.820
and for all my troubles
I'm glad I never have theirs.

21:26.855 --> 21:28.800
Your Majesty.

21:33.420 --> 21:37.920
Madam. I did not know
whether to tell you, but

21:37.955 --> 21:42.420
but the King has taken
Lady Misseldon as mistress.

21:48.620 --> 21:54.240
He must do as he will.
It is we, Lady Rochford,

21:54.275 --> 21:59.860
must always honour and obey.

22:03.210 --> 22:09.690
Do not leave trouble for me,
for I have great reason to be happy.

22:39.670 --> 22:42.280
The Duke of Suffolk,
and the Lord Privy Seal.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.470
You're going to North at once.

22:54.505 --> 22:55.475
Yes, Your Majesty.

22:55.510 --> 22:59.070
In order to establish due obedience,
you will administer an oath,

22:59.105 --> 23:02.137
to the leaders and gentlemen of
Yorkshire and Lancashire.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.936
They will acknowledge that they
made other oath contrary

23:04.971 --> 23:07.700
to their allegiance and to
the great offence of God.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.515
They must utterly renounce them

23:11.550 --> 23:14.625
and swear to be our true 
and faithful subjects.

23:14.660 --> 23:20.330
They must commit themselves to obey
and even to spill their blood to maintain

23:20.365 --> 23:24.580
all our laws and to assist our church
commissioners in their duties.

23:24.615 --> 23:29.745
If they will not take the oath,
then there will be no clemency.

23:29.780 --> 23:33.640
You will apprehend such persons where
there is no danger to yourself. And they will,

23:33.675 --> 23:37.500
by law, be judged to suffer execution.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.585
Your Majesty, what are your instructions

23:41.620 --> 23:44.260
regarding the setting of the
parliament at York?

23:48.430 --> 23:51.655
You may say there has been necessary delays.

23:51.690 --> 23:58.720
Your Majesty, I...I gave them
my word upon my honour.

23:58.755 --> 24:01.825
Let me remind Your Grace that rebellion

24:01.860 --> 24:06.000
is the heinous sin which cries
out to God for punishment.

24:06.035 --> 24:08.105
It is the sin of sin.

24:08.140 --> 24:11.260
For where there is no right order,
there is only carnal liberty,

24:11.295 --> 24:14.355
sin and Babylonian disorder.

24:14.390 --> 24:18.620
These wretched men have threatened
my whole realm with uproar

24:18.655 --> 24:22.850
as they have threatened me, Charles.

24:23.520 --> 24:27.390
They have to and will be punished for it.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.965
I agree with Your Majesty. If I might...

24:33.000 --> 24:37.830
No you may not. Your low birth,
Mr. Cromwell, deems you're unfit

24:37.865 --> 24:42.670
to meddle in the affairs of King's.
You're dismissed.

24:59.090 --> 25:01.325
- Hey Charlie. -Captain Constable.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.550
So the men are still together.
Are they still in good spirits.

25:04.585 --> 25:06.855
Aye, the lads are up for it

25:06.890 --> 25:10.400
Good, the rest will be
joining in us tomorrow.

25:11.950 --> 25:16.590
We'll walk in to Carlisle,
we will take the castle as soon as fast

25:18.760 --> 25:20.040
what we've got here

25:20.075 --> 25:21.475
Rabbits.

25:21.510 --> 25:25.950
Rabbits. So what are you going to do with that?
Feed the five thousand?

25:57.890 --> 26:03.900
Jesus! Charlie! Stay low!

26:05.250 --> 26:09.410
Out! Out!

26:24.570 --> 26:26.385
Alright

26:26.420 --> 26:27.310
Get him some water.

26:31.930 --> 26:34.740
My God, man what in God's name has happened?

26:35.960 --> 26:38.690
We started together,
Mr. Aske, near Carlisle,

26:38.725 --> 26:41.447
ready and eager to,

26:41.482 --> 26:44.135
assault the castle.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.525
Then Sir Christopher Dacre.
and the Lord Suffolk,

26:47.560 --> 26:50.960
came out of the castle with the men
and brought their spears on us

26:50.995 --> 26:54.360
and afterwards, made a
bloody chase and captured scores

26:57.760 --> 27:03.220
I saw my two boys slain.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.525
God help us.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.205
Sirs we are broken.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.680
What about Mr. Constable?

27:11.260 --> 27:13.810
Captured.

27:14.690 --> 27:16.710
My Lord.

27:21.790 --> 27:26.000
We've got him.
They broke their pledges.

27:26.035 --> 27:30.175
- I mean to see the King. -Yes, My Lord

27:30.210 --> 27:34.870
We shall impose martial law
on whole of the North.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.665
- John Constable? -Aye.

28:10.700 --> 28:14.070
Do you deny that you acted as
a leader and captain of this rebellion?

28:14.105 --> 28:17.440
No. I'm proud of it.

28:19.190 --> 28:24.120
You're going to be taken to London and
examined further as your actions and motives.

28:24.700 --> 28:28.610
you mean tortured,
you promised us a parliament,

28:28.645 --> 28:32.485
but you lied. You betrayed us

28:32.520 --> 28:38.290
You never meant to do anything,
did you, did you, Your Grace?

28:41.750 --> 28:46.700
Here are the names of those who refuse
to renounce their actions and sign the oath.

28:46.735 --> 28:50.860
- How many?
- Seventy-four, all to be executed, Your Grace.

30:44.160 --> 30:48.610
It was all well done Your Grace.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.830
You know that his Majesty's has
ordered us to arrest Lord Darcy

30:54.865 --> 30:57.460
Sir Ralph Ellerker and Robert Aske.

30:57.660 --> 31:00.710
They are to be charged
on suspicion of treason

31:00.790 --> 31:02.960
but must not know it.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.845
Your Grace must surely know

31:18.880 --> 31:21.135
that Mr. Aske Sir. Ralph and I

31:21.170 --> 31:25.830
were firmly and emphatically and
openly against this new rising.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.655
We believed and believe
still in the promises

31:29.690 --> 31:32.905
and assureties and good
gracious of the King's Majesty.

31:32.940 --> 31:39.010
It is also true that nothing can be done or
imagined here against the King's Majesty

31:39.560 --> 31:42.140
that I cannot let the
council and you know of.

31:42.175 --> 31:44.720
I am assured of your loyalty to his Majesty.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.440
Nevertheless, the King requires
you travel south

31:48.475 --> 31:50.560
with me to explain this recent events

31:51.520 --> 31:54.240
which seems so contrary to
his expressed hopes.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.390
Your Grace can see with your own eyes

31:57.630 --> 32:01.670
that I am old and sick and unfit to travel

32:04.000 --> 32:08.695
Allow me to speak openly to Your Grace.

32:08.730 --> 32:13.435
although I love and trust
the King absolutely

32:13.470 --> 32:18.200
and know that he would always
treat me justly and mercifully.

32:18.235 --> 32:22.940
I can not say the same
for some of his councillors.

32:23.630 --> 32:27.740
I would rather fear to fall
into their hands my Lord.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.260
Allow me to reassure you.

32:32.410 --> 32:37.150
I will write a letter to both the King
and council in all of your favours

32:37.960 --> 32:41.890
and shall we show you before we leave.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.535
Then, we must go.

32:47.570 --> 32:51.400
Yes, it is the King's command.

32:53.590 --> 32:59.510
Then I say God have mercy on us.

33:11.120 --> 33:16.980
God bless you and keep you,
my own dear husband.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.830
And you too my darlings,
but I shall be all right

33:21.865 --> 33:24.587
for I trust in the honestly of His Grace.

33:24.622 --> 33:27.275
He showed me a letter, it was written

33:27.310 --> 33:30.110
to the council on our behalf
and it was all good.

33:30.690 --> 33:33.550
He said he stood surety for us and I doubt

33:33.585 --> 33:36.410
any harm will come to us.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.720
After all, what could be gained
by when the North most now

33:39.755 --> 33:42.560
be appeased and quietened.

33:44.250 --> 33:48.615
There our daughters don't weep.
You're Yorkshire lass,

33:48.650 --> 33:53.790
Yorkshire lasses have iron in their
souls just like your good mother.

34:01.620 --> 34:05.920
You will see me again soon, I promise.

34:05.955 --> 34:07.340
God bless you Mr. Aske

34:08.080 --> 34:10.230
God speed Mr. Aske

34:18.290 --> 34:21.010
Men, march on.

34:26.909 --> 34:30.000
God bless you Mr. Aske

34:38.449 --> 34:41.250
I see you eating quail's eggs
again sweetheart?

34:42.139 --> 34:44.429
Did you not have those yesterday.

34:44.465 --> 34:45.570
Yes, Your Majesty.

34:46.139 --> 34:49.090
I seemed to have developed
fondness of them.

34:55.820 --> 34:57.700
Especial fondness?

34:57.735 --> 34:59.985
Well indeed.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.690
For some reason,
I desire quail's eggs above anything else.

35:04.770 --> 35:08.280
- Leave.
- Your Majesty

35:21.810 --> 35:25.890
I think you're with child.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.130
I am.

35:43.030 --> 35:43.970
My love.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.690
My Queen.

36:02.270 --> 36:03.945
John Constable

36:03.980 --> 36:08.880
you are a principal and unredeemed traitor
and villain against the King's Majesty.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.255
Nothing can save you.

36:11.290 --> 36:13.610
Oh Lord. forgive me, forgive them oh Lord

36:13.711 --> 36:15.511
for they know not what they do...

36:15.610 --> 36:17.600
Guards, hold him down on the table.

36:17.900 --> 36:33.220
Sweet Jesus! oh God! oh Jesus!

36:33.255 --> 36:35.810
Damn you to hell...

36:35.811 --> 36:37.911
Ahhh!! Ahhrrrgg!

36:41.970 --> 36:45.940
...Lord Darcy Your Grace I think the
journey almost broken him

36:45.975 --> 36:48.140
His Lordship is taken care of.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.970
This is Sir Francis Bryan.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.745
- Mr. Aske.
- Sir Francis.

36:54.780 --> 36:58.100
I have orders to commit you to the tower.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.245
- but
- it's for your own safety.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.655
You will be lodged comfortably enough.

37:05.690 --> 37:12.260
Mr Cromwell desires to ask
you a few questions.

37:16.580 --> 37:17.895
I trusted you, Your Grace.

37:17.930 --> 37:22.740
I swear, I have done my
best for you, Mr. Aske.

37:40.890 --> 37:42.640
The Duke of Suffolk, my Lord.

37:45.970 --> 37:47.540
You asked to see me.

37:48.310 --> 37:50.090
Yes Your Grace.

37:58.540 --> 38:01.530
Well explain yourself, what do you want?

38:02.660 --> 38:04.050
I have some reports.

38:04.180 --> 38:06.535
You always have reports Cromwell.

38:06.570 --> 38:08.855
But these are very interesting.

38:08.890 --> 38:12.005
they are reports from Assizes in Carlisle

38:12.040 --> 38:15.190
where he sat in judgement against rebels
who attempted to overthrow His Majesty.

38:15.225 --> 38:17.157
Everything was done legally and properly.

38:17.192 --> 38:19.090
seventy-four rebels were judged and hanged.

38:19.125 --> 38:21.485
There's the problem.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.685
one point all agree there were at least

38:23.720 --> 38:25.815
40,000 rebels armed and in the field

38:25.850 --> 38:29.115
and yet Your Grace found
only seventy-four guilty.

38:29.150 --> 38:33.400
I hanged those who were the leaders
and most guilty of inciting the rest to rebellion.

38:33.435 --> 38:37.650
Had you actually been there
to hear the evidence?

38:38.550 --> 38:41.840
I must be honest with Your Grace,
you had been accused of too great

38:41.875 --> 38:45.095
of leniency towards the rebels, towards

38:45.130 --> 38:51.760
recalcitrant monks and other
upholders of the old religion, it...

38:51.795 --> 38:56.335
it is disputed whether you
are in your heart and soul

38:56.370 --> 39:00.990
fully engaged in this struggle against the
treasonous rebels or whether you are

39:01.025 --> 39:05.020
in your heart still papist

39:05.055 --> 39:07.850
Who? Accused me?

39:09.440 --> 39:13.020
His Majesty.

39:15.250 --> 39:20.385
Consequently, his Majesty now
demands you return North

39:20.420 --> 39:25.630
and carry out an proper and efficient reprisals
against these rebels and traitors

39:25.665 --> 39:29.107
You are to make a terrible example of them.

39:29.142 --> 39:32.550
And teach those parts
the virtues of loyalty.

39:33.450 --> 39:40.690
Seventy-four is an inadequate number

39:44.690 --> 39:47.690
Your Grace

39:50.710 --> 39:55.590
Since you asked me for the truth,
I will answer that, in all parts of the realm

39:56.260 --> 40:00.160
men's heart were most hurt by
the destruction of the abbeys

40:00.195 --> 40:04.565
Because they thought
perhaps with a reason that

40:04.600 --> 40:09.040
this was the first fruit, of the destruction,
of their whole religion in England

40:09.410 --> 40:11.840
This letter of yours...

40:12.410 --> 40:17.280
On the 19th of Jan., you wrote to reassure
the mayor of common Pontefract

40:17.315 --> 40:21.175
"I should keep a clean true heart
to God and the King

40:21.210 --> 40:26.090
and will evermore further to be a true
petitioner for the commonwealth good."

40:27.020 --> 40:29.045
You signed it. T Dacy?

40:29.080 --> 40:33.500
I remember it. But I am not sure,
what is wrong with it.

40:33.535 --> 40:37.920
Can you not agree,
was it rather the spreading false rumours

40:38.530 --> 40:44.120
for example, that parish churches were going
to be pulled down, which actually caused rebellion

40:44.155 --> 40:49.985
No, it was the fact, that the abbeys
were being suppressed and burned.

40:50.020 --> 40:54.830
You wrote on the 19th of January that is after the King
declared his pardon and rebellion had ended.

40:54.865 --> 40:57.870
but I understood the King had also
agreed to a free parliament

40:57.905 --> 41:01.140
where subjects could still show
their griefs and complains

41:01.175 --> 41:02.975
my letter was only meant to...

41:03.010 --> 41:04.605
I will tell you what it meant, my Lord.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.315
What it meant is even after
the King's gracious pardon,

41:07.350 --> 41:09.990
you had not changed your
traitor's heart and opinions

41:10.025 --> 41:11.692
You continue to seek the annulment of laws

41:11.727 --> 41:13.823
that make for the good of the commonwealth

41:13.858 --> 41:15.920
and you still wish to depose the King.

41:18.090 --> 41:26.565
Tell me, why... they were
so important to you?

41:26.600 --> 41:30.980
Because the abbeys in the North
gave alms to poor men

41:31.015 --> 41:34.385
and Lord belief to serve God.

41:34.420 --> 41:37.240
They were one of the beauties of this realm

41:37.275 --> 41:39.950
to all men and strangers are alike.

41:41.820 --> 41:46.190
They took care of their servants,
their tenants,

41:46.225 --> 41:50.560
and their local communities
in every sort of way.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.190
From maintaining bridges and seawalls.

41:54.120 --> 41:57.545
to seeing that girls and boys
were brought up in virtue

41:57.580 --> 42:03.870
And when they stood, people not only had worldly
of refreshment in their bodies,

42:04.920 --> 42:08.585
but they also have a spiritual refuge.

42:08.620 --> 42:14.540
So you begrudge this suppression
and the King's supremacy

42:17.530 --> 42:23.310
After such confessions, Lord forgive us.

42:23.345 --> 42:26.995
It is not Mr. Aske but you,

42:27.030 --> 42:32.700
who are the very original and chief
cause of all this rebellion and mischief

42:32.735 --> 42:36.695
although You could probably find
some ways of having all

42:36.730 --> 42:40.770
the noble men's head of the realm
struck off you if you wanted.

42:41.090 --> 42:44.820
yet I trust, there might be one left

42:44.855 --> 42:48.550
who can still to strike off yours.

42:59.100 --> 43:04.790
Well, may it surprise
you to learn, Mr. Aske,

43:04.791 --> 43:06.191
That err..

43:07.360 --> 43:11.550
there is very good reason,
I determine to save you.

43:44.760 --> 43:49.640
You've been here for two days.
But still you don't talk to me.

43:49.675 --> 43:54.520
Even though you are unhappy.

43:54.555 --> 43:56.575
How'd you know?

43:56.610 --> 44:01.350
You wake in the night. You say things.

44:01.385 --> 44:03.630
What do I say?

44:06.370 --> 44:09.490
Unburden your heart.

44:12.020 --> 44:21.010
If I do, believe me,
everything will change.

44:36.370 --> 44:39.310
I am commanded to return
North to carry out retribution.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.345
I must excecute more rebels.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.800
Only this time I'll trial "proper" process.

44:46.060 --> 44:47.255
Many?

44:47.290 --> 44:53.075
Yes, many. Many, hundreds, thousands,

44:53.110 --> 44:55.210
I must kill hundreds of men,
women and children

44:55.245 --> 44:57.320
or lose the love of my King.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.675
Women and children?

44:59.710 --> 45:01.495
I have no choice.

45:01.530 --> 45:04.125
Of course you have choice!

45:04.160 --> 45:06.790
What if they were your own children?!

45:13.240 --> 45:16.670
I will still have to do it.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.470
His Majesty, the King.

45:50.740 --> 45:52.900
Stand up, Mr. Aske.

45:57.290 --> 46:01.730
Mr. Cromwell has reported your words to me.

46:01.765 --> 46:03.515
I've come to talk to you.

46:03.550 --> 46:09.000
About the abbeys and the religious
houses you care so much about.

46:09.035 --> 46:11.520
Please.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.925
You have so much affection for these monks.

46:29.960 --> 46:34.430
Yet I can prove to you how far
they are from good religious men.

46:35.130 --> 46:39.620
They claim to live in wilful poverty,
chastity and obedience.

46:39.655 --> 46:41.835
Yet they mass possessions.

46:41.870 --> 46:44.060
And put themselves outside the law,

46:45.310 --> 46:46.830
They are richer than princes.

46:47.370 --> 46:50.445
Yet but without our responsibilities.

46:50.480 --> 46:53.520
And what is wilful poverty anyway?

46:54.070 --> 46:57.490
And that's for obedience, God help us.

46:58.670 --> 47:00.765
How can they be obedient

47:00.800 --> 47:02.895
when they disobliged their sovereign Lord

47:02.930 --> 47:07.170
whom by God's commandments
they ought to obey in all things.

47:09.230 --> 47:12.900
We should not think of these
men as good religious men

47:12.935 --> 47:16.570
who forsake all earthly
possessions as they claim.

47:16.605 --> 47:22.690
But rather as idle and sturdy vagabonds.

47:29.870 --> 47:32.195
I like you Mr. Aske

47:32.230 --> 47:36.070
You may be misguided in
certain matters, yes but,

47:36.105 --> 47:39.885
your mistakes are honest.

47:39.920 --> 47:49.130
I know that in your heart your
are the most loyal of all men.

47:49.165 --> 47:53.070
I love and respect Your Majesty,
above all things.

47:53.105 --> 47:56.760
I would never seek to offend you

48:26.770 --> 48:31.690
Majesty, the boatman from Calais is here.

48:31.725 --> 48:35.740
- Majesty.
- Monsieur. Let me see.

48:41.070 --> 48:48.320
- Majesty.
- Quail eggs, Sir Francis, quail's eggs,

48:51.350 --> 48:53.480
To feed the Queen. Monsieur.
