WEBVTT

00:05.759 --> 00:07.762
- Zoey.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.765
Miles, can you say Zoey?

00:10.845 --> 00:12.407
- He cannot. He's a baby.

00:12.487 --> 00:13.489
- Zoey.

00:13.569 --> 00:15.331
- Oh, see, Grandma can do it.

00:15.411 --> 00:17.413
- Will you please bring
me that carafe?

00:18.575 --> 00:20.617
- What's with
the fancy plates today?

00:20.697 --> 00:22.660
- Did you forget?

00:22.740 --> 00:25.102
Tonight is the first night
of your birthday week.

00:25.183 --> 00:26.104
- It's not a thing.

00:26.184 --> 00:27.866
- Even if it was a thing,

00:27.946 --> 00:28.827
I don't need a whole week.

00:28.907 --> 00:30.629
I don't need a whole day.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.712
It's so soon after Dad,
I don't--

00:32.792 --> 00:34.514
I don't want people
making a fuss over me.

00:34.594 --> 00:35.715
- You're turning 30.

00:35.795 --> 00:36.997
It is a big deal.

00:37.077 --> 00:38.278
And you know what your
father would say

00:38.358 --> 00:40.040
if he were here right now.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.722
together: Bigger moments,
bigger memories.

00:41.802 --> 00:42.964
- That is correct.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.566
I'm sure he'd be

00:44.646 --> 00:46.528
setting up
the fireworks display

00:46.608 --> 00:48.290
and hiring a marching band.

00:48.370 --> 00:51.214
- Putting a jumpy castle
up in the backyard.

00:51.294 --> 00:53.296
- Yeah, that was
the best 21st birthday

00:53.376 --> 00:54.698
a boy could ever ask for.

00:54.778 --> 00:56.380
- Okay, you know what?
I guess it wouldn't be

00:56.460 --> 00:58.382
the worse idea
to honor his legacy

00:58.462 --> 01:00.545
with an engagement
that some might classify

01:00.625 --> 01:02.307
as a party.
- Yes!

01:02.387 --> 01:03.869
- Okay, I'm thinking
something like

01:03.949 --> 01:05.751
the parties you and Dad
used to throw.

01:05.831 --> 01:07.073
- Hmm.
- Can we do it here?

01:07.153 --> 01:09.876
- Yes, yes. Absolutely.
I would love that.

01:09.956 --> 01:12.479
We can hire a caterer,
and maybe set up a bar

01:12.559 --> 01:13.881
in the dining room.

01:13.961 --> 01:16.084
- Thank you.
- I'll do the flowers, and...

01:16.164 --> 01:17.685
if all this sounds okay to you.

01:17.766 --> 01:18.927
- It actually sounds
kind of great.

01:19.007 --> 01:20.249
- Hey, so, uh...

01:20.329 --> 01:21.850
How do you plan on
filling this place?

01:21.931 --> 01:23.853
I mean,
it's a pretty big house,

01:23.933 --> 01:25.575
and don't you have,
like, six friends?

01:25.655 --> 01:27.097
- Excuse you, me.

01:27.177 --> 01:29.059
I have a lot of close
relations I'll be inviting

01:29.139 --> 01:30.501
to this party.

01:30.581 --> 01:32.143
In fact,

01:32.223 --> 01:34.225
I might have to limit
the guest list.

01:34.546 --> 01:37.309
Hey, Alicia.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.351
You don't happen to
have plans Saturday night,

01:39.432 --> 01:40.513
do you?

01:40.593 --> 01:41.874
- I didn't know
you knew my name.

01:41.955 --> 01:43.677
- Of course I do.

01:43.757 --> 01:45.078
Hey, you want to come
to my birthday party?

01:45.158 --> 01:47.321
It's not my actual birthday.
That's the next day.

01:47.401 --> 01:49.203
But Saturday is historically

01:49.283 --> 01:50.525
the hottest party night
of the week.

01:50.605 --> 01:51.967
So, you in?

01:52.047 --> 01:54.049
- As like a caterer
or something?

01:54.930 --> 01:57.013
- No, as one of my main peeps.

01:57.093 --> 01:59.095
- Oh, okay. Yeah, sure,
I'll come to your party.

02:00.176 --> 02:01.418
- Great.

02:01.498 --> 02:03.100
Morning.

02:03.180 --> 02:04.942
What are we smiling about?

02:05.022 --> 02:06.184
- "Tech Assurance Weekly"
just came out

02:06.264 --> 02:07.385
with their annual list

02:07.465 --> 02:09.227
of the most influential voices
in tech,

02:09.307 --> 02:12.551
and you are looking at
influential voice number 27.

02:12.631 --> 02:13.873
- Whoa.

02:13.953 --> 02:16.796
That is huge!
Congratulations.

02:16.876 --> 02:20.321
- Thank you. It's cool.
Tatiana put me up for it.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.483
She's pretty much been acting
like my publicist these days.

02:22.563 --> 02:25.607
- So, I know
you're really popular...

02:25.687 --> 02:27.249
- I mean...
- But please tell me,

02:27.329 --> 02:29.572
you don't have
a "Save the World" gala

02:29.652 --> 02:31.854
on Saturday night, because I'm
having a 30th birthday party.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.417
So feel free to save
the world any other night

02:34.498 --> 02:36.500
but that night, please.

02:37.862 --> 02:39.904
- See if we can accommodate,
um...

02:39.984 --> 02:42.507
moving saving the world
to next week.

02:43.709 --> 02:45.711
Free now.

02:47.593 --> 02:49.596
Can't wait.

02:50.717 --> 02:52.719
- Thank you.

02:55.883 --> 02:57.365
I have two announcements.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.808
First, I'm having
a birthday party on Saturday.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.491
You all should be
receiving invitations shortly.

03:02.571 --> 03:03.813
- Quick party-related question.

03:03.893 --> 03:05.615
What man-to-lady ratio
are we talking about?

03:05.695 --> 03:06.936
- Depends on how many
women you invite.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.779
- On it.

03:08.859 --> 03:10.020
- Announcement number two

03:10.100 --> 03:11.262
comes from
Danny Michael Davis himself.

03:11.342 --> 03:12.823
He wants us to "turn the page"

03:12.904 --> 03:14.746
and move into
a new chapter at Sprqpoint

03:14.826 --> 03:16.388
by revamping
our signature phone.

03:16.468 --> 03:18.711
He's opened up the pitches
to the entire company,

03:18.791 --> 03:19.952
but how amazing
would it be if the new idea

03:20.032 --> 03:22.235
came from engineering?

03:22.315 --> 03:24.477
- Whoa, whoa. Leif's at a
birding conference all week.

03:24.558 --> 03:26.480
How can we do
this without him?

03:26.560 --> 03:28.202
- Easily.
My Robot Wars Team

03:28.282 --> 03:29.924
brought home the Golden
Sprocket three years in a row.

03:30.004 --> 03:30.965
I can think of something.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.527
- So can I.

03:32.607 --> 03:34.610
I'm actually thinking
of something right now.

03:34.690 --> 03:36.091
- Well, I look forward to
seeing what you come up with,

03:36.171 --> 03:37.894
and also to seeing all of you

03:37.974 --> 03:40.457
at my party.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.819
- Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.902
We are newly committed
to fire safety

03:44.982 --> 03:46.264
here at Maximo,

03:46.344 --> 03:48.586
and we felt it best
to add another alarm.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.509
Thoughts?

03:50.589 --> 03:52.431
- You're good to go.

03:52.511 --> 03:55.595
But you probably didn't need
a certified fire marshal

03:55.675 --> 03:57.677
to come all the way
out here for that.

03:58.919 --> 04:00.080
- Better safe than sorry,
right?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.802
- It is.

04:01.882 --> 04:04.005
But if what you really wanted
was to see me again,

04:04.085 --> 04:06.328
you could have just asked
me on a proper date.

04:07.809 --> 04:08.851
- Huh.

04:08.931 --> 04:09.932
Could have done that.

04:10.012 --> 04:12.135
- I would have said yes.

04:12.215 --> 04:14.217
Hope to hear from you soon.

04:19.704 --> 04:20.945
- You look happy.

04:21.025 --> 04:22.747
- I just love a hot man
with a clipboard.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.790
My God. Mm.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.352
- Is that a thing?
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.035
- There she is,
almost-birthday girl.

04:29.115 --> 04:30.316
What are we doing this year,
huh?

04:30.396 --> 04:31.838
Going back to the Exploratorium

04:31.918 --> 04:32.960
where more people
could judge us

04:33.040 --> 04:34.321
for not being there
with a child?

04:34.401 --> 04:36.684
- Okay, not this year.
This year...

04:36.764 --> 04:38.566
I've decided to throw
a big blow-out party.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.848
But it's going to
be very tasteful.

04:39.928 --> 04:41.850
- Wow.
- Max, hi.

04:41.930 --> 04:42.891
- Oh, oh, one second.

04:42.972 --> 04:44.173
- Hi, hey.
- Hi.

04:44.253 --> 04:45.615
- I'm so sorry.
I'm so late.

04:45.695 --> 04:46.736
You're not going to
believe what happened to me.

04:46.816 --> 04:48.178
- Tell me.
- Okay. So I thought I was

04:48.258 --> 04:49.980
getting on the 580,
but I was getting on the 280.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.542
So then I ended up on the
wrong side of the Bay Bridge...

04:51.622 --> 04:52.943
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

04:53.024 --> 04:54.505
And then this really nice
hippie gave me directions

04:54.585 --> 04:55.707
and this worry stone.

04:55.787 --> 04:57.309
Any takers?
- Me!

04:57.389 --> 05:00.072
Ooh, Mo. Cute top.
Nice to meet you.

05:00.152 --> 05:02.034
Put this directly
in your cubby.

05:02.114 --> 05:03.436
You know why.
- Yes, please.

05:03.516 --> 05:05.278
Rose, this is my uh...

05:05.358 --> 05:06.560
This is Zoey,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.522
and Zoey, this is Rosanna.

05:08.602 --> 05:10.685
Or Rose. We went to
sleepaway camp together.

05:10.765 --> 05:13.408
- We did. For six summers,
and he had a giant crush on me.

05:13.488 --> 05:14.930
- Oh, wow, you don't say?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.372
- Okay, settle down.

05:16.452 --> 05:18.254
I believe it was
a mutual crush,

05:18.334 --> 05:20.937
and I'm not the one who
went on a night hike with...

05:21.017 --> 05:22.219
What was his name again?

05:22.299 --> 05:23.220
- The tall kid.
- Yeah, with the--

05:23.300 --> 05:25.903
together: Josh Goldstein.
- Yes!

05:25.983 --> 05:27.545
He's in jail now.

05:27.625 --> 05:28.947
- Oh, cool.

05:29.027 --> 05:30.468
- So, how do you two
know each other?

05:30.549 --> 05:33.632
- Oh, Max and I
met at Sprqpoint.

05:33.712 --> 05:35.915
We actually started on
the same day, and...

05:35.995 --> 05:38.038

05:38.118 --> 05:39.840

07:06.744 --> 07:08.306
Max and I have been friends,
you know, and stuff,

07:08.386 --> 07:09.307
ever since.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.508
- Great.

07:10.588 --> 07:12.270
- We were just gonna
grab a table

07:12.351 --> 07:13.352
and get some dinner,
if you want to join us.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.474
- No, thank you, um...

07:16.195 --> 07:18.278
I have a lot of big
party planning to do.

07:18.358 --> 07:19.880

nice to meet you, Zoey.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.522

07:21.602 --> 07:23.444
- I've got us
the best table they had.

07:23.524 --> 07:24.445
- No big deal, right?

07:24.525 --> 07:26.528
- And the biggest chair.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.011
- Is it just me,
or does it seem

07:29.091 --> 07:31.534
like those two are
really trying to--

07:31.614 --> 07:34.457
[electric guitar]

07:37.341 --> 07:38.382
.

07:38.462 --> 07:41.185
- I don't know what
the worst part was.

07:41.265 --> 07:44.149
How they sang together,
or how they...

07:45.911 --> 07:47.232
Danced together.

07:47.312 --> 07:50.116
Or, how Max looked at her

07:50.196 --> 07:52.999
when they were singing
and dancing together.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.521
- Mm, I get it.

07:54.601 --> 07:56.483
I hate when I see white
people dance, too.

07:56.564 --> 07:57.605
But when's the last
time you and Max

07:57.685 --> 07:59.407
talked about
your relationship status?

07:59.487 --> 08:01.009
- What are you talking about?

08:01.089 --> 08:02.811
- Well, clearly he's
thinking of somebody else,

08:02.891 --> 08:06.015
and to be fair, you've also
been thinking of somebody else.

08:06.095 --> 08:08.938
- I have?
Who?

08:09.018 --> 08:12.943
- What about that cute
Australian boy toy of yours?

08:13.023 --> 08:15.106
- Okay.
We're just friends.

08:15.186 --> 08:16.467

a day that goes by

don't do that

- Okay, defensive.

08:20.592 --> 08:22.595
I'm just saying that you can

27:59.125 --> 28:00.647
Luther, Stevie, Chaka?

- Who?
There was "bearded barleys."

28:04.051 --> 28:05.573

I'm saying this,

singing to me?

your name with a Y.
- Speaking of Y,

28:27.879 --> 28:30.763
why haven't you Tinder ladies
shown up yet?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.445

they're Russian bots.

28:48.384 --> 28:52.389
"If you have
to make a speech,

28:52.469 --> 28:55.432
"you should keep it brief,

28:55.512 --> 28:57.154
and speak from the heart."

So, Zoey,

I love you,

I like you,

so great, but...

in a minute or so.

are kind of a package deal,

Maybe not the best choice
for my birthday party, friend.

very much

come here together?

meet a late night Bumble date,

like his profile says he is,

head straight home.

look at that face.

But no. We are just friends.

might be someone else

ending until tonight.

still stuck in my head.

love musicians, but I...

start your own band?

called it that.

would have loved it.

up for them, but--

Mm! Yes.

the big 3-O?

going back to bed.

- Ah, that's what
happens when you're old.

37:12.668 --> 37:14.951
- I also texted Simon

37:15.031 --> 37:17.594
and invited him
here for dinner tonight.

37:17.674 --> 37:22.400
- Ooh, you better go on
with your dirty 30 thang.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.842
- Oh, how'd it go with
you and Perry?

37:23.922 --> 37:25.764
- Oh, I'll tell you
how that went.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.688
It turns out he
has two young kids

37:28.768 --> 37:31.651
that he shares custody
of with his ex-husband.

37:31.731 --> 37:34.094
- So many big adult words

37:34.174 --> 37:36.136
for one little sentence.

37:36.217 --> 37:38.579
Is that a dealbreaker?
- I don't know.

37:38.660 --> 37:40.582
It just goes against
all of my instincts

37:40.662 --> 37:42.304
to hold onto my youth
as long as I can.

37:42.384 --> 37:43.946
- Makes sense.

You should probably just forget
about that nice grown man

giddier than I've

37:47.190 --> 37:48.551

worth you going outside

for that guy.

- Hm.
I see what you're doing.

gray hair sprouting out.

- Happy birthday.

38:10.738 --> 38:12.660
How did breaking up
with the band go?

38:12.740 --> 38:15.263
- Ah, it was
pretty devastating.

- Oh, no.
They took it that badly?
