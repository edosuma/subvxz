solely out of concern
for Ms. Welker’s well-being.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.826
Appreciate it.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.955
Should I deem any question inappropriate,
I will cut off this interview immediately.

-Are we clear?
-Sure.

-How long has she worked for you?
-Uh... three years maybe.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.921
You know anyone,
who would wanna hurt her?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.214
-For what?
-For anything.

11:55.631 --> 11:58.467
-Absolutely not.
-You have contact with her recently?

11:58.592 --> 12:00.052
(CHUKLES) Guys, look where I am.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.264
-It’s not like she’s been visiting.
-You ever call her?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.349
Of course not.
That would be inappropriate.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.560
You have contact recently
with anyone else?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.270
Your brother, people from work?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.981
-Simon, don’t answer that.
-What, they don’t have the phone records?

12:13.149 --> 12:16.652
I talk to somebody from work everyday.
I got a business to run.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.612
I don’t let nothing stop me
from doing that.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.614
You talk to anybody at work about Lucy?

If you think I’m gonna let you

12:22.825 --> 12:25.870
stick a witness-intimidation charge
on my client, you are sadly mistaken.

-The best I got here.
-Let’s go.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.083
I don’t have nothing to do with the fire,
and I don’t have nothing to do with this.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.462
It’s just coincidence she gets beat up
the same day she’s gonna testify

12:34.628 --> 12:36.172
-against you?
-Detective, I said we’re done.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.132
What’s the matter,
you don’t have enough problems?

12:38.215 --> 12:39.508
SIMON: What are they bothering me for?

12:39.592 --> 12:42.219
You lean on witnesses, believe me,
you’re only gonna make it worse.

-JOHN: Hmm.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.916
His father started a business,
Simon took it over.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.460
He’s been arrested for going
after somebody with a baseball bat.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.171
They dropped the charges.
He allegedly threw a guy out a window.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.089
He survived.
And also dropped the charges.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.258
About a half a dozen more
that follow the same general pattern.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.010
What’d you get when you talked to him?

Chesty prick laughed at us.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.599
I just spoke to the Port Authority Police.

Lucy Welker bought a ticket
on a bus to Basking Ridge.

-All right.

-James McGowan to see Lieutenant Bale.

-Mr. McGowan, come in.

-Eh.

in my bar, Lieutenant.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.511
So, if you don’t mind my asking,
what’s this about?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.389
Mr. McGowan,
we have certain rules in the department.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.891
One is that an officer
can’t be employed by a bar.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.352
-And?
-I received an anonymous tip

14:13.561 --> 14:15.896
that one of my detectives
is working as a bouncer for you.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.565
Oh, it’s a lie, Sir, flat out.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.734
-Greg Medavoy isn’t your bouncer?
-Greg? No.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.028
A customer, for sure, but that’s all.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.701
So, he didn’t get that black eye
working for you?

14:28.909 --> 14:31.453
No... (CHUCKLES) ...we had a bit
of a donnybrook last night,

14:31.579 --> 14:35.416
and you know what, Greg mixed in,
but that was strictly as a friend.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.460
I’d lay money that the guy we had
to put out was the one who called.

14:38.794 --> 14:39.962
Mr. McGowan...

14:41.297 --> 14:42.548
I spent a number of years working

14:42.631 --> 14:44.466
in the department’s internal-affairs
division.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.386
That gave me a pretty good ear
for when someone’s lying to me.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.763
So, I’m gonna repeat my question.

14:50.347 --> 14:53.475
And if you lie to me again,
you can expect the state liquor authority

14:53.559 --> 14:56.604
and the vice squad
to become a constant presence at your bar.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.815
So much so, that eventually
you’ll padlock the doors and walk away.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.068
Now let’s start again.

-He was acquitted.
-He got a good lawyer.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.515
The acquittal means
that the crime never happened.

what he did to that woman...

it’s a nonissue.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.691
Mayor, Craig beat her up
when Michael was staying with her.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.902
-Will she testify to that?
-I don’t know.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.989
I don’t know, she’s scared of him.
I’m still trying to get in touch with her.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.075
Any chance she could attend
the hearing this afternoon?

15:51.241 --> 15:52.242
Probably not.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.913
Well, we can’t bring up the attack
unless there’s someone to testify to it.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.999
Well, Craig did time in prison.
He was arrested for domestic violence.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.628
We need someone to testify
to his current propensity for violence.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.553
You know, after you called,
I spoke to Bobbi Kingston.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.973
She said, you were the best thing
that ever happened to Michael.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.561
I don’t know about that, but I think
we have a pretty good situation.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.647
Seeing Craig is just going to mess him up.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.107
I understand.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.860
Do you think the court
will give Craig custody?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.821
Well, custody’s not the issue today,

16:28.904 --> 16:30.656
so let’s just deal
with what’s in front of us.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.076
-In worst case, can they give him custody?
-Could they? Yes.

He doesn’t care about Michael.
He just wants to get back at me.

it would be trouble.

with the Korensky's of this world.

My sister’s not one of them.
She’s fragile.

22:41.943 --> 22:43.904
Not much
in the self-confidence department...

22:44.863 --> 22:45.906
unfortunately.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.742
I think this was more than a failure
of self-confidence.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.536
I’ve seen her in similar situations.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.789
Admittedly, none quite so dramatic.

Our mother was dead.
Lucy was the only one living with him,

23:07.344 --> 23:10.347

and she just took it.
