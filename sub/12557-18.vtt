00:10.777 --> 00:13.279
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:13.314 --> 00:16.399
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:16.434 --> 00:18.284
a journey into a wondrous land

00:18.319 --> 00:20.153
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:20.188 --> 00:23.907
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.937
Okay, dump him.

03:51.282 --> 03:55.368
Nathan edward bledsoe,
of the bowery bledsoes,

03:55.403 --> 03:57.870
a man once, a specter now,

03:57.905 --> 04:01.007
one of those myriad,
modern-day ghosts that haunt

04:01.042 --> 04:03.509
the reeking nights of this city

04:03.544 --> 04:06.629
in search of a flop, a handout,
a glass of forgetfulness.

04:07.263 --> 04:10.383
Nate doesn't know it,
but his search is about to end

04:10.418 --> 04:13.519
because those shiny new shoes
are going to carry him

04:13.554 --> 04:17.273
right into the capital
of the twilight zone.

04:53.009 --> 04:54.894
Hey, nate.

04:54.929 --> 04:57.397
Yeah, what do you want?

04:57.432 --> 04:58.648
Nothin'.

04:58.683 --> 05:00.516
Just wondered
where you was going.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.653
You, uh,
make a little strike, nate?

05:03.688 --> 05:04.904
Nah.

05:04.939 --> 05:07.407
So what's the hurry?

05:07.442 --> 05:08.658
I don't know.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.412
Don't try to kid me, nate-
you're after a jug.

05:12.447 --> 05:14.914
Sam. What has come of you?

05:14.949 --> 05:16.165
I see the whole thing

05:16.200 --> 05:18.034
is clearly a case
of assault and battery.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.285
Oh, what are you
talking about?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.170
I just asked him where he was...

05:21.205 --> 05:23.039
i will gladly testify for you
in a court case.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.290
Eh, forget it.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.541
He didn't mean nothing.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.044
Spoken like a true gentleman.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.546
There, you see? Aren't
you ashamed of yourself

05:30.581 --> 05:31.798
to think that a
man of such honor

05:31.833 --> 05:33.683
would refuse to
share his windfall

05:33.718 --> 05:34.934
with his old comrades.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.803
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:36.838 --> 05:38.054
Nathan, nathan,
nathan, please,

05:38.688 --> 05:40.556
don't destroy the image
that i have created.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.059
It's quite obvious that
you're on to something.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.944
We couldn't mistake
your steadfast walk,

05:44.979 --> 05:47.447
your sense of well-being.

05:47.482 --> 05:50.566
And your new shoes.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.818
They're...

05:51.853 --> 05:54.320
a bit expensive,
aren't they?

05:54.355 --> 05:56.823
I found 'em in a alley.

05:56.858 --> 05:58.708
Yes. It looks to me

05:58.743 --> 06:00.576
like, uh, british
workmanship,

06:00.611 --> 06:03.713
but aren't they just,
uh, a little bit snug?

06:03.748 --> 06:06.215
They do feel a little funny.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.467
Yes, well, i
would be glad...

06:07.502 --> 06:09.969
ah, but they fit okay.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.996
Uh, nathan,
when you found the footgear,

06:37.031 --> 06:40.116
did you also,
by the remotest chance, find...?

06:40.151 --> 06:42.618
Just the shoes.

06:43.252 --> 06:47.006
Now where are
you headed, pal?

06:47.041 --> 06:51.377
Take your hand off me.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.459
Dane?
I'm glad you're back, honey.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.710
I keep losing.

08:17.213 --> 08:19.098
Well, what have you got...?

08:19.715 --> 08:22.852
Who are you?

08:24.103 --> 08:25.972
What do you want?

08:26.007 --> 08:28.474
Look, you better
get out of here.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.489
That's dane's bottle.

08:44.490 --> 08:47.627
Mm-hmm, that's why
i'm drinking it.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.497
You know, if he comes back
and finds you here,

08:51.532 --> 08:53.382
he'll kill you.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.387
Mister, don't you hear me?

08:58.422 --> 08:59.755
He'll kill you.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.393
Wilma...

09:07.513 --> 09:10.650
you'll never
make it downstairs.

09:10.685 --> 09:12.768
Fix me a drink.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.608
Bernie? Wilma.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.111
Is dane there?

10:45.146 --> 10:48.864
Oh, well look, if he comes
back, will you tell him that...

10:48.899 --> 10:52.001
would you tell him
that i need him right away?

10:52.036 --> 10:53.869
I'm at the apartment.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.755
Okay.

11:49.558 --> 11:52.061
All right, mister,
where's dane?

11:53.312 --> 11:53.929
Dane?

11:54.563 --> 11:57.066
I don't understand, lady.

11:57.101 --> 11:58.317
Oh, yes, you do.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.186
You've got his shoes,
and no one else

12:00.221 --> 12:02.688
wears shoes
like dane's.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.939
Oh, the shoes.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.825
I found the shoes.

12:05.860 --> 12:07.076
You mean, you stole them.

12:08.694 --> 12:11.197
Yeah, that's right,
lady, i stole them.

12:11.232 --> 12:13.699
Where?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.202
I don't... i don't
understand...

12:16.237 --> 12:16.836
at the club?

12:16.871 --> 12:18.087
The what?

12:18.122 --> 12:21.207
Well, what was
he doing there?

12:21.242 --> 12:23.092
I don't know,
lady, honest.

12:23.127 --> 12:25.594
Well, whatdo
you know, mister?

12:25.629 --> 12:26.846
Nothing.

12:26.881 --> 12:29.348
I don't know
nothing, lady, i...

12:30.599 --> 12:32.468
you know, i ought
to kill you-

12:32.503 --> 12:35.354
busting in here
like you own the place.

12:35.389 --> 12:37.223
Lady, please, don't do that.

12:37.258 --> 12:40.359
Please don't do that,
please don't do that!

12:40.394 --> 12:42.611
Put on the shoes
and get out of here.

12:42.646 --> 12:44.480
Yeah.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.982
Yes, lady, i'll go.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.906
I thought i told you
to mix me a drink.

13:26.941 --> 13:29.408
Oh, look, mister...

13:29.443 --> 13:32.528
do i have to
break your arm?

13:32.563 --> 13:34.413
No.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.453
How about that drink?

14:23.212 --> 14:25.080
Well, what'll it be?

14:25.115 --> 14:26.966
What'll it be?

14:27.001 --> 14:28.217
What do
ialwayshave?

14:28.252 --> 14:30.719
I don't know what
you always have, mister,

14:30.754 --> 14:32.588
i really don't.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.090
Try tequila...

14:36.342 --> 14:38.477
...with a cube of sugar.

14:49.104 --> 14:52.241
Do you want to tell me
who you really are?

14:52.276 --> 14:54.743
You tell me.

14:54.778 --> 14:57.613
You know,
dane's coming back,

14:57.648 --> 15:00.115
and if you knew what
was good for you...

15:00.150 --> 15:02.618
oh, i, uh, know
what's good for me.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.372
You.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.006
Don't touch me.

15:07.623 --> 15:08.874
Don't touch me,
don't...

15:13.879 --> 15:15.764
now, who am i, baby?

15:15.799 --> 15:17.633
Dane.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.638
No, you're not.

15:22.673 --> 15:23.889
You're not, you're not!

15:23.924 --> 15:25.774
What have you
done with him?

15:25.809 --> 15:28.777
And what have you done with him?

15:28.812 --> 15:30.646
What have you done with him?

15:37.536 --> 15:41.907
Now, look, i have
some unfinished business.

15:45.661 --> 15:49.415
But you be here
when i get back.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.680
I love that rhythm.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.433
Yes, sir, what
will it be?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.936
Tequila with a cube of sugar.

16:47.189 --> 16:49.692
Yes, sir.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.205
Friend of yours?

17:05.457 --> 17:07.326
Jimmy, that fellow
at the bar-

17:07.361 --> 17:09.211
you know him?

17:09.246 --> 17:10.462
Negative.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.464
Ben, what about you?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.085
I've never seen him before, why?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.721
Well, he seems to know us.

17:22.090 --> 17:25.844
You like to live
dangerously, do you?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.096
Am i?

17:27.131 --> 17:30.232
If you keep on
staring at this woman.

17:30.267 --> 17:33.352
It's not the woman
i'm staring at.

17:34.103 --> 17:35.988
Look-

17:36.023 --> 17:37.856
you're driving me crazy.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.993
Why don't you
get rid of the guy?

17:41.028 --> 17:43.495
Or invite him over,
dosomething!

17:49.118 --> 17:52.254
Ben, get him over here.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.128
Hey.

18:00.379 --> 18:04.767
Mr. Dagget would like
to see you over there.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.520
At his own
personal table.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.274
I don't know
what to say.

18:12.309 --> 18:16.028
Don't say anything,
just do it.

18:17.279 --> 18:19.782
All right, i accept.

18:20.649 --> 18:23.152
Hey, sweetheart,
sit over there.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.791
Hello, bernie.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.042
You know me?

18:30.659 --> 18:33.162
Oh, by reputation.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.664
Oh...
oh, i get it.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.052
Tequila with
a lump of sugar, huh?

18:40.087 --> 18:40.669
Mmm.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.172
That's kind of
a funny coincidence.

18:43.207 --> 18:45.057
How's that?

18:45.092 --> 18:48.927
Well, i, uh... i had a good
friend who drank the same stuff.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.813
Oh?

18:50.848 --> 18:53.315
What's
your name?

18:53.350 --> 18:53.932
Kilroy.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.568
Look, buddy, when
mr. Dagget asks...

18:57.820 --> 19:00.322
what's your business,
mr. Kilroy?

19:00.357 --> 19:04.693
Well, you might say, uh,
i'm kind of a messenger.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.578
I've got a message for you,

19:06.613 --> 19:08.197
bernie.

19:08.232 --> 19:10.699
Well, let's have it.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.202
No, i, uh, was given
instructions

19:13.237 --> 19:15.704
to deliver
this message privately.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.841
Well, it's a touchy matter,
you know how it is.

19:18.876 --> 19:20.709
Oh.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.212
Who's it from?

19:23.247 --> 19:24.463
Afraid i can't say.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.851
It's a nice place.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.719
Real nice.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.856
The, um... the fellow
that gave you this message,

19:33.891 --> 19:35.724
what did he look like?

19:35.759 --> 19:38.861
Uh, bernie, my business
is forgetting, not remembering.

19:38.896 --> 19:40.112
Mm-hmm.

19:40.147 --> 19:44.483
All right, messenger, let's go.

19:45.984 --> 19:49.738
Oh, no,
this has got to be private.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.623
It will be.

20:02.885 --> 20:04.136
This is my office.

20:04.171 --> 20:06.638
You can't get
any more private than this.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.507
Even the walls
are soundproof.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.758
Take it easy.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.763
Happy easter.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.648
You still got
a message for me?

20:16.683 --> 20:20.402
Oh, yes, but, uh, tell
the easter bunny here

20:20.437 --> 20:22.905
i'd like my gun
back afterwards.

20:22.940 --> 20:25.407
Mm-hmm.

20:25.442 --> 20:26.658
All right, boys.

20:29.778 --> 20:31.029
Sit down.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.281
Make yourself
comfortable.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.417
Well, well, well.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.039
How did you get it
cleaned so fast, bernie?

20:43.041 --> 20:44.293
What?

20:45.544 --> 20:46.795
The rug.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.047
I understand
blood's very hard

20:49.082 --> 20:50.933
to get out,
isn't it?

20:50.968 --> 20:53.435
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:53.470 --> 20:55.938
I'll tell you what
i'll do, bernie.

20:55.973 --> 20:58.807
I'll tell you
what i'm talking about.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.692
I'm talking about a guy

21:00.727 --> 21:04.446
who had a pretty nice thing
going for him.

21:04.481 --> 21:06.949
Plenty of dough,
plenty of action.

21:06.984 --> 21:10.702
Only he wasn't happy
because he had a partner.

21:10.737 --> 21:14.206
That meant he couldn't
be number one.

21:14.241 --> 21:15.457
Being number one

21:15.492 --> 21:17.960
was very
important to him.

21:17.995 --> 21:21.830
So he offered
to buy the partner out.

21:21.865 --> 21:27.469
When the partner refused
to sell, he killed him...

21:27.504 --> 21:29.338
right there.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.840
You know, you'd never know.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.343
It was
a slick job.

21:34.378 --> 21:35.594
Who are you?

21:37.980 --> 21:39.848
Oh, i told you.

21:40.482 --> 21:41.733
I'm a messenger.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.236
And, uh,
here's the message.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.993
You didn't think that'd
work twice, did you?

22:03.372 --> 22:07.125
I'll be back, bernie...

22:07.160 --> 22:09.011
and i'll keep coming back

22:09.046 --> 22:12.631
again and again

22:12.666 --> 22:16.268
and i'll get you.

22:16.303 --> 22:19.388
So help me, i'll get you.

22:24.526 --> 22:26.395
Who is he?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.280
It's d...

22:30.782 --> 22:32.651
i don't know.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.198
Oh, my dear nathan,

23:20.233 --> 23:23.952
you really are smashed,
aren't you?

23:36.465 --> 23:38.350
Very careless of you.

23:40.852 --> 23:45.857
As for these, we'll discuss them
at some future date.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.611
There's an old saying that goes,
"if the shoe fits, wear it,"

23:49.646 --> 23:51.480
but be careful.

23:51.515 --> 23:55.233
If you happen to find a pair of
size nine black and gray loafers

23:55.268 --> 23:57.736
made to order in the old
country, be very careful.

23:58.370 --> 24:02.124
You might walk right into
the twilight zone.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.498
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:09.533 --> 24:12.000
will tell you
about next week's story

24:12.035 --> 24:14.970
after this message.

24:15.005 --> 24:17.139
And now, mr. Serling.

24:17.174 --> 24:19.641
Perhaps no character
in or out of fiction

24:19.676 --> 24:21.510
has had as much notoriety
or publicity

24:21.545 --> 24:23.395
as the so-called grim reaper.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.263
Next week onthe twilight zone,

24:25.298 --> 24:27.766
through the good offices
of mr. Earl hamner,

24:27.801 --> 24:30.902
we present a unique story
called "the hunt."

24:30.937 --> 24:34.022
It concerns the demise
of an old hunter and his dog.

24:34.057 --> 24:37.159
And this one we rather urgently
recommend to people

24:37.194 --> 24:39.027
who have lost
their senses of humor

24:39.062 --> 24:42.781
and who'd like to recover same.

24:42.816 --> 24:44.032
As one of my kids says,

24:44.067 --> 24:47.169
there's a trillion, trillion
ways of telling a story.

24:47.204 --> 24:49.671
But there's really only one way
to tell a chesterfield story

24:49.706 --> 24:50.922
and that's simply to say

24:50.957 --> 24:53.425
that great tobaccos
make a wonderful smoke.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.293
Try chesterfields.
They satisfy.

25:25.140 --> 25:26.992
This is james arness.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.877
You know, it's only a short hop

25:28.912 --> 25:31.379
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

25:31.414 --> 25:33.882
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
