<i>NARRATOR".
When we last saw Robin...</i>

00:10.970 --> 00:14.682
<i>...the artful Joker had hung him
on a gigantic Bat-Mobile...</i>

00:14.891 --> 00:20.021
<i>...along with dozens of giant palette knives,
about to slice him to slivers...</i>

00:20.230 --> 00:24.067
<i>...with Bruce Wayne securely tied
to a nearby chair...</i>

00:24.275 --> 00:27.654
...in <i>the monstrous mobile room
of Joker's studio.</i>

00:27.862 --> 00:33.368
<i>In one moment, we'll find out
whether Robin's saved or shaved.</i>

01:54.657 --> 01:56.826
Bruce, you've got to do something.

01:57.702 --> 02:02.457
- These blades are getting lower and lower.
-We've got one chance, Robin.

02:02.665 --> 02:07.587
If I can get to that governor
and stop this creation of Joker's.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.888
You can do it, Bruce.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.141
Stick With it.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.697
I seem to have loosened
one of these bonds.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.505
- Good work, Bruce.
-Robin, work yourself loose.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.924
Disengage one of those knives
and get down here.

03:15.363 --> 03:18.366
Quickly, disconnect the drive belt.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.543
That was close. Not much room for error.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.671
From now on, all the errors are on Joker.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.591
I think we'll prepare
a little surprise for him, Robin.

03:38.094 --> 03:42.098
Soon Robin will be gone forever
and I will be rich forever.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.560
When your priceless art treasures
are delivered to me.

03:45.768 --> 03:49.772
Joker, you could at least untie us.
My hands are getting stiff.

03:49.939 --> 03:54.485
Oh, but of course, my dear.
The Joker is nothing if not magnanimous.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.114
How about me?

03:58.322 --> 04:02.243
Well, my generosity does not extended
to overweight matrons, madam.

04:02.452 --> 04:04.287
Joker, that's not very nice.

04:04.495 --> 04:08.207
Well, we artists are not required to be nice.
Only talented.

04:08.416 --> 04:13.838
Oh, speaking of which, my latest creation
should have completed its work by now.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.359
What a beautiful sight. Beautiful.

04:35.568 --> 04:39.614
Oh, what magnificent,
beautiful red blood Boy Wonder had.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.992
Has, Joker. That's not blood.
That's some of your red paint.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.953
My beautiful red blood is still inside me,
no thanks to you.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.081
Go! Get them!

04:56.839 --> 04:58.716
Aah!

05:00.510 --> 05:03.888
Baby Jane, those philistines in there
intend to do me bodily harm.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.681
You've got to stand by me.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.601
After you tied me up
and tried to steal my art collection?

05:08.810 --> 05:11.646
But I couldn't help myself, my dear.
I'm an artist.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.983
Oh, I have a desire for things of beauty.
Beauty's irresistible to me.

05:16.192 --> 05:20.112
Oh, that's why I'm so attracted to you,
my dear.

05:20.947 --> 05:25.827
- Really?
-Oh, I swear it, on a stack of blue boys.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.628
Thank you. But I had to let him
knock me around a little bit.

05:35.837 --> 05:39.632
We don't want these crooks to make any
connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman.

05:39.841 --> 05:43.261
Gosh, that's right, but it's sure a tough way
to throw them off the track.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.680
Fortunately, I'm in good condition.

05:45.888 --> 05:49.767
But we still have to round up the leader
of these artistic failures. Come on.

05:49.976 --> 05:53.062
I did it all for art, Baby Jane. All for art.

05:53.271 --> 05:57.066
Can you doubt that I'm a great artist
after seeing my paintings?

05:57.275 --> 06:00.152
Your paintings were impressive, Joker.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.488
Certainly not the work of an ordinary mind.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.411
Aah! Stay away from me.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.622
That juvenile delinquent
has no appreciation for fine art.

06:11.831 --> 06:16.335
- Baby Jane, you're not going to protect him.
-He's just a misguided artist, Robin.

06:16.544 --> 06:20.464
And we're going to re-guide him,
straight to the Gotham State Penitentiary.

06:20.673 --> 06:24.468
But the art collections haven't been
delivered yet, so he hasn't stolen anything.

06:24.635 --> 06:28.890
And as for the kidnapping,
I for one refuse to press charges.

06:29.098 --> 06:33.185
And as for them, they're all worn out
from climbing the social ladder.

06:33.394 --> 06:37.648
While I alone, with my filthy rich Daddy's
money and prestige...

06:37.857 --> 06:41.402
...am in a position to keep them
from reaching the top.

06:41.611 --> 06:44.906
Well, I certainly wouldn't press charges,
Baby Jane.

06:45.907 --> 06:49.160
It won't help you, Joker.
Bruce Wayne will press charges.

06:49.368 --> 06:54.874
- He was born on top of the social ladder.
-Yes, I am reasonably secure socially.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.960
However, if Baby Jane
thinks the Joker is simply misguided...

06:58.169 --> 07:00.087
...I must defer to her judgment.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.174
You're a sweetie, Brucie.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.760
And now I have my very own artist
to play with.

07:05.968 --> 07:11.015
- I am at your command, my dear.
-Come on, you big hunk of genius.

07:11.223 --> 07:14.352
Ta-ta, Boy Bungler,
and tell your chicken-hearted partner...

07:14.560 --> 07:19.190
...that if I catch him on the street,
I'll run him out of town. Ha-ha-ha!

07:19.565 --> 07:24.320
- Why didn't you press--?
-Let's untie the ladies first, Boy Wonder.

07:25.237 --> 07:30.242
Oh, thank you so much, Robin.
Mr. Wayne, thank you.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.538
Why didn't you press charges?

07:34.705 --> 07:38.042
It's dangerous. You and I have been
seen together often enough as it is.

07:38.209 --> 07:41.587
Letting him go. He's not only free,
but he thinks Batman's afraid of him.

07:41.754 --> 07:45.091
Don't worry,
Joker won't be under that delusion for long.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.807
<i>NARRATOR". Presently in the handsome
mansion of Baby Jane's filthy rich father...</i>

07:53.391 --> 07:56.560
Do have some more chicken, Joker.
You need your strength.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.855
I could exist on two grapes
and a thimble of water.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.651
But my muse, my muse is starving.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.195
More chicken for the Joker's muse.

08:09.281 --> 08:13.160
Tell me, Joker, where do you get
your ideas for your paintings?

08:13.327 --> 08:19.333
Ah, inspirations, my dear, from my muse
and from beautiful admirers.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.503
If only I could feel
that I'd inspired a great work of art.

08:22.712 --> 08:27.425
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You Will, you will. Ah!

08:27.633 --> 08:29.010
A message from my muse.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.471
- What does it say?
-Ah! Clear the table.

08:36.225 --> 08:39.352
- Paint. Bring me paint.
-Charles, you heard the Joker.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.523
Never mind, I brought my own. Ha-ha-ha.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.361
Ah, yes. Thank you. Ha-ha-ha.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.281
Whoo! Ah, ha-ha-ha.

08:50.448 --> 08:54.410
Oh, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

08:54.660 --> 08:58.289
Whoo! Oh, magnificent, magnificent.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.544
Magnificent. Look at that. Magnificent.

09:03.753 --> 09:05.880
Never seen anything so beautiful
in my life.

09:08.049 --> 09:10.092
What a magnificent artist I am.

09:10.259 --> 09:15.848
Ooh, a veritable masterpiece.
All right, boys, go to work on it.

09:16.057 --> 09:18.517
But, Joker, that's a priceless antique table.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.853
Out with the old, in with the new.

09:34.784 --> 09:39.747
- Joker, they're destroying it!
-Oh, not destroying, my dear. Creating.

09:39.955 --> 09:45.711
Look at it this way. You're not losing a table,
you're gaining a masterpiece.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.767
- I see you removed the stain, Alfred.
-Yes, sir.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.186
The Batnaphtha finally did the trick.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.856
Now I can start returning
the signs I removed from the Bat-poles.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.525
What about removing Joker?

10:07.733 --> 10:12.071
We must anticipate Joker's next move
and be there waiting for him.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.573
How can you predict
what a kook like that will do?

10:14.782 --> 10:20.704
The criminal mind, erratic as it is,
nevertheless has certain characteristic patterns.

10:20.913 --> 10:25.251
For instance,
Joker has begun an artistic caper.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.086
I suspect he'll continue it.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.755
And he can count
on Baby Jane Towser's help.

10:29.964 --> 10:33.175
Yes, I'm afraid he's completely bamboozled
that poor girl...

10:33.384 --> 10:35.219
...and I'm sure he'll try to use her.

10:35.386 --> 10:37.555
The question is, how?

10:37.763 --> 10:40.432
Think of it, my dear.
You'll be tell your grandchildren...

10:40.641 --> 10:43.435
...that you witnessed the turning point
of 20th century art.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.479
These paintings should be in the Louvre.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.314
Or in the Gotham City Museum.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.192
There's no room in the Gotham City Museum.
It's filled up.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.195
Yes. And with what?
A lot of dusty relics of the past.

10:53.404 --> 10:54.864
Outworn and outmoded.

10:55.072 --> 10:59.577
No, we'll go down there tonight and replace
those old relics with my brand new paintings.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.830
- But we can't do that, Joker.
-Why not?

11:03.038 --> 11:05.124
Don't you think my paintings
are good enough?

11:05.291 --> 11:09.211
After all, they were once
your very valuable antique dining table.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.381
Of course your paintings
are marvelous, but--

11:12.590 --> 11:13.632
Then it's all settled.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.553
I happen to know that your filthy rich daddy
has a special founder's key...

11:17.761 --> 11:22.349
...to the Towser Wing of the museum.
-Yes, he does, but--

11:22.558 --> 11:26.812
Do you want your genius, me,
to find another inspiration?

11:27.021 --> 11:31.609
Oh, no.
Joker, I must always be your inspiration.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.652
Then go get Daddy's key.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.489
The Towser Wing of the museum
is being renovated this week.

11:37.698 --> 11:42.620
Which will make it all the easier
for us to make our little, uh, exchange.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.753
Alfred should be finished shortly, Robin,
and we can put our little plan into effect.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.547
The Batphone.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.843
- Yes, commissioner.
-The Joker's been too quiet, Batman.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.179
I'm worried. A whole day
and nothing's happened.

12:00.346 --> 12:03.390
That larcenous phony has something
under his hat besides his head.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.226
<i>- Yeah.
- The chief is right.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
Robin and I would like
to handle this ourselves.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.398
Especially since Joker
has been spreading ugly rumors about me.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.983
Whatever you think best...

12:13.192 --> 12:17.279
...but no one could believe for a second
that you're afraid of that cackling cutpurse.

12:17.488 --> 12:18.948
Thank you, commissioner.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.117
The chief and I won't move
until we hear from you.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.745
I hope that won't be too long,
commissioner.

12:24.954 --> 12:26.163
And tell Chief O'Hara...

12:26.372 --> 12:31.252
...that Robin and I have something
in our pockets besides our hands.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.878
<i>Right.</i>

12:34.296 --> 12:36.465
I'm all through, sir.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.884
Let's have a look, Alfred.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.638
I've done my best.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.140
Fine, Alfred.

12:47.893 --> 12:52.523
<i>NARRATOR". And that night in the Towser Wing
of the Gotham City Museum...</i>

12:52.731 --> 12:57.111
There. Now all the world
can see what a genius I am.

12:57.736 --> 13:03.534
- And what an inspiration I am and my table.
-Oh, of course, my dear.

13:03.742 --> 13:08.080
Joker, what are you gonna do with all
the dusty old relics that used to hang here?

13:08.247 --> 13:13.085
Ah, that junk?
I'll take it to the city dump and burn it.

13:13.294 --> 13:18.132
Now, be a good girl and go and get
another one of my masterpieces.

13:19.258 --> 13:23.512
Careful, you dolt. Those paintings
are priceless. How many are left?

13:23.679 --> 13:26.849
- This is the last one, Joker.
-Have you loaded them onto the truck?

13:27.016 --> 13:28.934
All but this one.
Where should we take them?

13:29.101 --> 13:32.521
To the last place where the Gotham City Police
expect us to go.

13:32.730 --> 13:38.068
- Our old studio.
-Right. Ha-ha-ha! Get going, boys.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.363
- Here's another masterpiece.
-Ah!

13:41.572 --> 13:44.158
Won't the museum directors be surprised?

13:44.325 --> 13:48.329
Ooh! Hoo, hoo!
They'll be overjoyed, my dear.

13:50.039 --> 13:54.084
Let me see that.
There's a good place over there.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.521
Handle them carefully, boys.
There's 10 million under those blankets.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.776
Well, I can't understand you,
my dear, if you mumble.

14:18.984 --> 14:23.155
Well, you're almost as bad as my muse.
I could never understand her either.

14:23.364 --> 14:25.991
Well, art styles change,
but crime goes on forever.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.703
Is that why I'm tied up?
After all I've done for you?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.163
Been your biggest booster?

14:31.372 --> 14:36.043
Friendship ends when real felony
finally takes over. Ha, ha.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.004
Mm. Keep an eye on her.

14:56.105 --> 14:59.108
<i>- Commissioner Gordon.</i>
<i>- Working nights, commissioner?</i>

14:59.316 --> 15:00.984
- Joker.
-Joker?

15:02.986 --> 15:05.322
I've decided to give you
a present, commissioner...

15:05.489 --> 15:07.574
...for being so nice to me all these years.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.953
If you're trying to offer me a bribe, Joker...

15:11.161 --> 15:13.038
<i>A bribe? Oh, don't be ridiculous.</i>

15:13.247 --> 15:14.456
I intend to present you...

15:14.623 --> 15:19.253
...with the entire Renaissance collection
of the Gotham City Museum as a gift.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.589
Renaissance art collection? How did you--?

15:22.798 --> 15:26.218
Never mind how, commissioner.
I've got it and I'm giving it to you.

15:26.427 --> 15:27.928
Now, isn't that nice of me?

15:28.137 --> 15:32.558
Of course there's a slight delivery charge,
about $10 million.

15:32.766 --> 15:36.353
Payable within an hour
or I burn the entire collection.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.273
When Batman gets his hands on you...

15:39.481 --> 15:42.151
Batman? Ha! That Cowardly Creep?

15:42.359 --> 15:45.863
He's so scared of me he doesn't dare
come out of his Batcave.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.116
You might as well forget help
from Batman, commissioner...

15:49.283 --> 15:52.077
<i>...and start thinking of my 10 million.</i>

15:52.286 --> 15:54.955
- Good evening, Joker.
-Oh!

15:55.122 --> 15:57.416
Oh, Batman, you're on the line too.

15:57.583 --> 15:58.917
Well, ha-ha-ha.

15:59.084 --> 16:04.131
- Oh, hiding out in the commissioner's office?
-I hope you don't mind, Joker.

16:04.339 --> 16:09.052
Oh, you better stay inside, Batboob,
because if I catch you outside...

16:09.261 --> 16:12.181
...I'm going to pin your pointed ears back,
do you hear?

16:12.389 --> 16:16.685
Of course, Joker.
What's this I hear about stolen paintings?

16:16.852 --> 16:22.608
Oh, I have dozens of them,
and each one an old master.

16:22.816 --> 16:27.446
- You don't say.
-Yes, I do say.

16:46.256 --> 16:49.384
You Caped Clotpoll.
You switched paintings on me.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.720
These are nothing
but kindergarten drawings.

16:51.929 --> 16:58.393
Naturally. And even a kindergarten mind
could have anticipated your every move.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.313
This caper was even more obvious
than most.

17:01.522 --> 17:07.861
You can say that over the phone, Batman,
but if I had you here, I'd pound you to a pulp.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.364
Start pounding, Joker.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.205
It's music to me ears.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.751
It is, Chief O'Hara. It is indeed.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.472
Beautiful. Beautiful.

17:42.187 --> 17:45.274
Oh, it's horrible, horrible.

17:46.358 --> 17:50.320
Oh, while the Dynamic Dimwits
are flapping my flunkies, I'll make my escape.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.907
But first a trip to Bruce Wayne's house
to pick up some quick cash...

17:54.116 --> 17:55.867
...so I can hide out for few months.

17:56.076 --> 18:01.248
And get even with that rich fink
for quitting my kidnap keeper this morning.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.216
He's gone.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.261
Knowing the Joker's need for cash
and his dislike for Bruce--

18:56.428 --> 19:00.807
- You think he's headed for Wayne Manor?
-I'm sure of it. Come on, to the Batmobile.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.484
- Where's Bruce Wayne?
-Mr. Wayne is not at home, sir.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.236
Too bad. I'll get my revenge later.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.657
Right now, I'll settle for cash.
Where's the safe?

19:16.865 --> 19:20.535
My duties do not include
aiding and abetting thievery.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.871
Oh, no?

19:23.872 --> 19:25.707
- I see.
-Ha-ha-ha.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.002
This way, sir.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.673
Please be calm, madam.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.342
One peep out of you
and I'll blow your head off.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.053
- Where's the safe?
-Over there.

19:38.261 --> 19:42.766
- Oh, my, you poor little thing.
-Behind the picture, sir.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.269
There's no safe there. Aah!

19:46.853 --> 19:49.815
Alfred, be careful.
The Joker's an arch-criminal.

19:50.023 --> 19:54.361
- I know, madam, but a very poor fencer.
-You Anglo-fink, I'll smash you to smidgens.

19:54.569 --> 19:57.572
May I point out that smidgens
is a childish effusion...

19:57.739 --> 20:03.286
...which should have no place
even in so poor a vocabulary as yours, sir.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.718
Stand back. Stand back, I say, or I'll...

20:17.884 --> 20:20.429
- Aah? What's this?
-Don't touch that.

20:23.724 --> 20:26.893
Ah, ha! A secret passage.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.993
- Alfred, what's happened?
-The Joker tripped the Bat-pole switch...

20:43.160 --> 20:46.329
...and mistook this for a secret passage.
-He's down in the Batcave.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.291
He didn't quite make the Batcave,
Master Robin.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.335
- Then where is he?
-I believe he should be arriving presently.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.589
Emergency Bat-pole elevator.
Fast thinking, Alfred.

20:55.797 --> 20:56.840
Thank you, sir.

20:59.634 --> 21:04.014
Someone get me off this crazy dumbwaiter.
I can't breathe!

21:04.222 --> 21:09.186
Joker says he can't breathe, Alfred.
Why don't you give him some breathing space?

21:09.394 --> 21:11.605
With pleasure, sir.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.983
Oh, no! Aah!

21:17.110 --> 21:20.113
It's lucky you didn't get around
to washing our other costumes...

21:20.280 --> 21:22.991
...or Joker might have found himself
wearing a Bat-costume.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.243
I think we better see
about Baby Jane Towser.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.537
Alfred, it looks like you can handle things.

21:27.746 --> 21:32.083
I believe everything is well in hand, sir,
and the young lady's in the living room.

21:33.627 --> 21:36.880
Now, now, Ms. Towser, it wasn't your fault.

21:37.088 --> 21:40.509
Anyone could be misled
by the Joker's slick talk.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.678
But I was so gullible, Mrs. Cooper.

21:43.887 --> 21:47.140
Oh, Batman and Robin,
thank heaven you're here.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.477
- Is Alfred all right?
-Yes, he's just fine, Mrs. Cooper.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.939
Batman, I'm so sorry
for all the trouble I've caused you.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.317
It was an honest mistake, Baby Jane.
No one blames you for it.

21:57.526 --> 21:58.985
I blame myself.

21:59.194 --> 22:03.865
It'll be a long time before anyone
catches me in another art gallery.

22:04.074 --> 22:06.326
It'll be an even longer time for Joker.

22:06.535 --> 22:11.540
- By the way, where is Joker?
-Right now, Joker's having his ups and downs.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.124
You might say that.

22:13.333 --> 22:17.087
Help!

22:17.295 --> 22:21.466
Alfred, old pal, have pity. Ho-ho-ho!

22:22.092 --> 22:25.428
We Anglo-finks have a long memory.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.646
I really shouldn't take pleasure
in another creature's misfortunes...

22:34.855 --> 22:41.862
...but, uh, occasionally one may be forgiven
for a slight twinge of satisfaction.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.331
Of course, there's no telling what the public
is going to like, you know?

22:53.498 --> 22:57.752
Personally, I never understood modern art.
I've always liked Whistler's Mother.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.838
- To tell the truth, so have I.
-Shh!

23:00.046 --> 23:02.299
Someone might hear you
and you'd lose a fortune.

23:02.465 --> 23:06.094
Which would decrease the proceeds to
the Wayne Foundation Free-Nursery School...

23:06.261 --> 23:09.973
...to which Alfred is donating his profits.
-It is the least I could do, sir.

23:10.140 --> 23:13.602
Especially in view
of the, uh, nature of the paintings.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.646
Excuse me,
I think I see a customer ripe for plucking.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.691
I mean, interested in buying.

23:20.692 --> 23:24.321
I don't understand it at all.
It must be very profound.

23:24.529 --> 23:27.324
Notice the large green blob.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.286
Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean.
Very profound.

23:37.042 --> 23:41.087
Well, Alfred, it's not everyone who can have
his first efforts displayed at Park's.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.380
Thank you, sir.

23:42.589 --> 23:47.218
The Joker and his paintings are in prison
and Alfred and his paintings are at Park's.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.054
A rather nice turn of events.

23:49.262 --> 23:54.434
- And very fine paintings they are too, Alfred.
-You really think so, sir?

23:54.643 --> 23:59.147
Oh, indeed I do.
Why, uh, they're masterpieces.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.899
Perhaps you'd like to own one.

24:02.150 --> 24:06.404
Yes, yes, I would,
but, uh, I can't afford the price.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.324
Oh, that's no obstacle, sir.

24:09.532 --> 24:14.871
Allow me to present you with this one
as a token of my esteem.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.417
Mother machree.
