00:00.012 --> 00:01.490
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.491 --> 00:02.195
That was Liam.

00:02.196 --> 00:03.304
The foster brother you told me about?

00:03.315 --> 00:06.417
- He forced me to have sex with him.
- You're so bossy sometimes.

00:06.451 --> 00:08.319
- It's kind of a turnoff.
- Bossy?

00:08.353 --> 00:10.621
Emma. Emma!

00:10.655 --> 00:12.389
My girlfriend just broke up with me too.

00:12.424 --> 00:14.658
- Well, that was dumb of her.
- Is Jesus home?

00:14.693 --> 00:16.694
Um... no.

00:16.728 --> 00:18.596
He isn't, I'm sorry.

00:18.630 --> 00:21.532
Dear Callie, my name is Sophia.

00:21.566 --> 00:24.435
And according to my dad, I'm your sister.

00:24.469 --> 00:26.403
If you don't want me
to meet Sophia, I won't.

00:26.438 --> 00:30.374
If you want to, I think you should.

00:33.411 --> 00:35.412
Can we hang out again? Like, soon?

00:35.447 --> 00:36.580
Yeah, no, I'd like that.

00:36.615 --> 00:38.549
When's the last time you spoke to Jude?

00:38.583 --> 00:41.685
More specifically, when was the
last time that he spoke to you?

00:41.720 --> 00:43.587
Jude, talk to me.

01:08.613 --> 01:10.614
Oh!

01:10.649 --> 01:13.517
- Sorry!
- No, it's fine.

01:13.552 --> 01:17.555
I'm just glad you weren't doing
what I thought you were doing.

01:17.589 --> 01:19.423
What did you think I was... ?

01:20.625 --> 01:23.694
Ew! No, I... I don't do that.

01:23.728 --> 01:24.695
Ok.

01:30.702 --> 01:31.702
Morning.

01:41.279 --> 01:42.548
Do you ever get overwhelmed

01:42.549 --> 01:45.564
knowing that you have to
brush your teeth every morning

01:45.570 --> 01:48.485
and every night for the rest of your life?

02:01.433 --> 02:05.502
Hey, listen, everyone. We
spoke to Jude's therapist.

02:05.537 --> 02:07.504
The good news is there's nothing
physically wrong with him.

02:07.539 --> 02:10.441
- Ok, so why isn't he talking?
- We're not really sure,

02:10.475 --> 02:12.685
but they think it's something
called selective mutism.

02:12.686 --> 02:14.675
It's a type of anxiety disorder.

02:14.679 --> 02:18.215
- So he's choosing not to talk?
- It's not as simple as that.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.484
It's, um, it's more like
it's a coping mechanism.

02:20.518 --> 02:24.221
- So what are we supposed to do then?
- We all have to be patient.

02:24.256 --> 02:27.258
And do our best to keep
his stress level down.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.060
We're not gonna make a big
deal out of his silence.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.554
We're not gonna pressure him to talk.

02:30.562 --> 02:32.296
And Jude'll keep seeing his therapist.

02:32.330 --> 02:34.465
A lot of good that's gonna
do, if he's not talking.

02:34.499 --> 02:38.235
There are a lot of different ways to
communicate, Callie. Like Mama said,

02:38.270 --> 02:40.537
we'll just act like business as usual...

02:42.440 --> 02:47.344
- Hey, buddy. We, uh, just...
- So, uh...

02:47.379 --> 02:49.613
Oh, um, I'm probably gonna
be late to dinner tonight.

02:49.648 --> 02:52.483
We have extra practice all week.

02:52.517 --> 02:56.553
I'll, uh, I'll get that. Just...
you guys expecting somebody?

02:56.588 --> 03:00.224
Well, I'm really proud of you, Mariana.
You've been working really hard.

03:00.258 --> 03:02.626
Thanks. Apparently, I'm
working a little too hard.

03:02.661 --> 03:04.595
Kaitlyn says my smile is way too big,

03:04.629 --> 03:07.531
and I look like I'm teaching
Zumba to toddlers at the Y.

03:07.565 --> 03:12.202
So I'm shooting more for a medium
smile. Is this a medium smile?

03:12.237 --> 03:15.339
Sure.

03:15.373 --> 03:18.475
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Callie. There's someone at the door for you.

03:28.420 --> 03:30.321
Hi.

03:30.355 --> 03:33.357
I know I should've texted or something,

03:33.391 --> 03:36.694
but I couldn't wait to give you this, so...

03:36.728 --> 03:39.463
Here.

03:41.599 --> 03:44.668
You said you liked my jacket, so...

03:44.703 --> 03:48.238
Wow!  Um...

03:48.273 --> 03:52.309
- You didn't have to...
- Oh, I know. I wanted to.

03:52.344 --> 03:54.712
How did you even know where I live?

03:54.746 --> 03:57.514
I saw your address on some
of my dad's legal papers,

03:57.549 --> 04:00.584
and I asked Marisol if we could
drop by here on my way to school.

04:00.618 --> 04:03.387
- Who's Marisol?
- My nanny.

04:04.656 --> 04:10.494
And now I'm totally going
to be late, so I gotta go.

04:10.528 --> 04:14.498
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course. It's beautiful. Thank you.

04:14.532 --> 04:17.567
Because it's fine, you can
totally return it if you want.

04:17.601 --> 04:21.305
No. No, no. I... I love it.

04:22.507 --> 04:25.309
Ok.

04:25.343 --> 04:29.446
Marisol is literally going to kill me.

04:29.481 --> 04:30.614
See you soon?

04:31.649 --> 04:33.650
- Yeah.
- Ok.

04:47.465 --> 04:48.432
Jude.

04:54.472 --> 04:56.273
Hey.

05:31.208 --> 05:37.500
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:38.583 --> 05:40.617
You should have seen Sophia's face

05:40.652 --> 05:44.621
when she dropped off that gift
this morning. She was so excited.

05:44.656 --> 05:47.224
I don't know how I'm gonna tell
her I can't see her anymore.

05:47.258 --> 05:50.394
Hold up, hold up. Why are you
gonna do that? Because of Jude?

05:50.428 --> 05:52.362
How do you even know that's what he wants?

05:52.397 --> 05:55.432
Because I know my brother.
And it's pretty obvious.

05:55.467 --> 05:58.402
You two have been through
a lot of bad stuff.

05:58.436 --> 05:59.967
All right, you've been jerked around,

05:59.968 --> 06:02.153
you've never known
where you were gonna live

06:02.160 --> 06:06.243
or for how long. Maybe not
talking is his way of feeling

06:06.277 --> 06:09.446
like he's finally in charge of
something in his life. You know?

06:09.481 --> 06:13.484
Or maybe I've just scarred him for
life and he'll never speak again.

06:27.332 --> 06:29.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:29.634 --> 06:33.403
Did, um... didn't Mariana tell
you I came over last night?

06:33.438 --> 06:35.472
- You did?
- I'm sure she just forgot.

06:35.507 --> 06:38.509
Yeah, probably.

06:39.677 --> 06:42.613
- So...
- Oh, it wasn't...

06:42.647 --> 06:47.351
I just wanted to say, when
we talked at practice...

06:48.553 --> 06:50.420
I don't want you to
think that I don't care.

06:50.455 --> 06:54.324
I mean, I actually feel pretty awful

06:54.359 --> 06:55.492
about how everything went down.

06:55.527 --> 06:57.694
It was my fault. I never meant to hurt you.

06:57.729 --> 07:00.364
I know. And I'm sorry.

07:00.398 --> 07:06.203
I... I started feeling
all weird and insecure.

07:06.237 --> 07:09.640
I guess I just felt like that you
weren't really attracted to me.

07:09.674 --> 07:14.578
- That's not true at all.
- But you're right, I'm bossy.

07:14.612 --> 07:17.247
No, I shouldn't have said it like that.

07:17.282 --> 07:20.417
You're strong and you know what
you want and you ask for it.

07:20.451 --> 07:22.553
That's not a turnoff. Not at all.

07:25.356 --> 07:27.591
I was thinking,

07:27.625 --> 07:31.562
maybe it was a mistake, breaking up.

07:33.598 --> 07:37.267
Hey, Connor.

07:37.302 --> 07:40.337
- Hey. Can you talk for a minute?
- Of course, have a seat.

07:43.608 --> 07:48.512
- Everything ok?
- Um, no, not really.

07:48.546 --> 07:52.649
I wanted to know, is there
anything I can do to help Jude?

07:52.684 --> 07:55.619
Besides making sure the other
kids don't make fun of him.

07:55.653 --> 07:59.389
- Are they making fun of him?
- Not in front of me.

07:59.424 --> 08:00.490
Not anymore.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.430
Well, thank you for that.

08:06.464 --> 08:10.267
I appreciate you looking out for
him, being such a good friend.

08:11.536 --> 08:13.503
Did something happen?

08:15.673 --> 08:17.641
My dad thinks Jude is gay.

08:17.675 --> 08:19.576
That's why I can't spend the
night at your house anymore.

08:21.579 --> 08:23.513
I see.

08:25.316 --> 08:29.386
- Did he say that to Jude?
- No. But I did.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.254
You told Jude you thought he was gay?

08:31.289 --> 08:34.424
No, I told him my dad did.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.426
But I didn't stand up to him.

08:36.461 --> 08:38.328
And I think that really
hurt Jude's feelings.

08:38.363 --> 08:40.631
I'm sorry.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.568
I wish he'd talk to me again.

08:46.371 --> 08:47.638
It's ok.

08:47.672 --> 08:49.406
It's ok.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.475
It's all right.

08:52.677 --> 08:53.677
You're not your father.

08:55.313 --> 08:57.381
Jude knows that.

08:57.415 --> 08:59.483
And he's gonna speak to you again.

08:59.517 --> 09:02.452
You know, I think we all just
need to give him some space

09:02.487 --> 09:06.156
to figure out all the
stuff he's feeling inside.

09:06.190 --> 09:11.628
- So, it's not my fault?
- No, sweetie. It's not.

09:30.314 --> 09:34.418
- Hey. Looking at your tax return?
- Yeah. I wish.

09:34.452 --> 09:38.488
So... how's the pregnancy going?

09:40.258 --> 09:44.261
I remember the first trimester.
Ugh! It can be a bear.

09:44.295 --> 09:47.364
The nausea, the mood swings, the
weight gain. That was just me.

09:47.398 --> 09:50.400
I see you still haven't taken
off that baby weight yet.

09:50.435 --> 09:52.636
Just kidding.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.405
You're looking good, Mike. Looking good.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.443
Thanks. Actually, I owe it all to Dani.

09:59.477 --> 10:02.279
- She's got me doing yoga.
- You? Really?

10:02.313 --> 10:04.281
Yeah! Says it's good for stress relief.

10:04.315 --> 10:07.551
I could use a little of that myself.
I'm about to have six children.

10:07.585 --> 10:11.254
Oh, my God! What were we thinking?

10:11.289 --> 10:16.359
Come on, Stef. Anybody
can manage that, it's you.

10:16.394 --> 10:18.562
You and Lena are unbelievable moms.

10:18.596 --> 10:21.531
I'm really happy for you guys.

10:21.566 --> 10:26.536
Thanks, Mike. Means a lot. It does.

10:27.538 --> 10:29.272
You seeing Brandon tonight?

10:29.307 --> 10:31.575
Yeah, Dani and I are gonna
attempt to make empanadas.

10:31.609 --> 10:33.510
So, um,

10:33.544 --> 10:35.679
you might wanna save some
leftovers for Brandon. Just in case.

10:35.713 --> 10:37.681
I may be doing yoga now,

10:37.715 --> 10:41.685
but I'm still not really an
optimist. I'll see you later.

10:46.591 --> 10:48.492
That Jane Doe in the morgue
you been asking about?

10:48.526 --> 10:50.393
- Yeah.
- They finally got a cause of death.

10:50.428 --> 10:52.429
Blunt force trauma. They're
ruling it a homicide.

10:52.463 --> 10:55.365
- You said you might know who she was?
- Yeah.

10:55.399 --> 10:57.367
You ever get those dental
records you were waiting for?

10:58.503 --> 11:00.370
No. Not yet.

11:12.844 --> 11:14.612
Hey.

11:15.881 --> 11:18.549
Oh, ok.

11:19.751 --> 11:21.819
Sure, it's no problem.

11:22.954 --> 11:24.855
Yeah, I'll tell him.

11:26.658 --> 11:27.958
Ok, fine.

11:27.993 --> 11:29.927
Yeah, we'll see you when you get here.

11:31.563 --> 11:32.797
Bye.

11:34.633 --> 11:36.634
Let me guess. He has to work late?

11:36.668 --> 11:41.772
Yeah, he had a late arrest so
he's got some paperwork to do.

11:48.613 --> 11:50.154
- I'm gonna go.
- Why?

11:50.855 --> 11:52.775
Dinner is ready, you should stay and eat.

11:52.951 --> 11:55.920
If my dad's not coming, then
there's no reason for me to stay.

11:55.954 --> 11:58.589
You don't have to worry. It's
not like something's gonna happen.

11:58.623 --> 12:01.459
- Yeah. I know.
- So sit down and have dinner.

12:02.527 --> 12:04.728
- How can you do this?
- Do what?

12:04.763 --> 12:08.732
Move in with my dad, sleep next to
him every night knowing what we did.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.502
I hate myself. I can
barely look him in the eye.

12:11.536 --> 12:13.571
First of all, your dad
and I were broken up.

12:13.605 --> 12:15.506
- So that makes it ok then?
- No.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.675
- But I didn't cheat on him.
- I was drunk.

12:17.709 --> 12:18.592
You used me.

12:18.593 --> 12:21.580
You wanted to hurt your dad for
all of the times he hurt you.

12:21.713 --> 12:23.848
You didn't screw me that
night, you screwed him.

12:23.882 --> 12:27.551
- You are so full of...
- The truth?

12:27.586 --> 12:29.787
You know it and so will he.

12:29.821 --> 12:34.692
So before you consider unburdening
yourself of all this guilt,

12:34.726 --> 12:36.961
keep one thing in mind.

12:36.995 --> 12:40.798
If your dad finds out, I'm not
the only one he'll never forgive.

12:46.838 --> 12:50.574
I might have to figure out
a way to live with myself,

12:50.609 --> 12:52.710
but I sure as hell don't
have to have dinner with you.

13:02.521 --> 13:05.489
Why didn't you tell me
Emma came by last night?

13:05.524 --> 13:07.825
Oh, I don't know, maybe
because you were upstairs

13:07.859 --> 13:10.561
shoving your tongue down Hayley's throat?

13:10.595 --> 13:12.963
I wasn't... she was... look, this...

13:12.998 --> 13:14.765
This thing with Hayley isn't serious.

13:14.799 --> 13:17.701
You could have said no if you
were still hung up on Emma.

13:17.736 --> 13:20.671
Why do guys always act like they don't
have a choice if a girl wants to have sex?

13:20.705 --> 13:23.774
- We don't!
- Ok, that's just ridiculous.

13:23.808 --> 13:26.644
Does Emma want to get back together?
Is that why she came over here?

13:26.678 --> 13:28.612
- Maybe.
- So what did you say?

13:28.647 --> 13:30.881
I told her we both need to take
some time to think about it.

13:30.916 --> 13:34.652
Is that code for you need
some time to dump Hayley first?

13:34.686 --> 13:37.888
Look, Hayley is, like, super sensitive.

13:37.923 --> 13:40.724
She just had her heart
broken, and she's my friend.

13:40.759 --> 13:42.660
She's kind of my only
friend on the dance team.

13:42.694 --> 13:45.629
- Look, I don't want to hurt anyone.
- Well, then don't.

13:45.664 --> 13:48.499
- Be honest with them.
- Ok, I will.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.568
Ok, good.

13:50.602 --> 13:52.770
As soon as I figure out what to say.

14:02.581 --> 14:05.482
Hey, sweetie. Can I have a word with Jude?

14:05.517 --> 14:07.751
Uh, yeah, sure.

14:14.826 --> 14:16.727
You do your homework?

14:18.597 --> 14:20.598
Can you turn that off for a minute?

14:23.868 --> 14:25.903
So Connor came to see me today.

14:27.672 --> 14:29.540
He told me what his dad said.

14:32.577 --> 14:35.846
At first, I was... I was
pretty angry at Connor's dad,

14:35.880 --> 14:39.583
and I'm not gonna lie,
I'm still kind of mad.

14:39.618 --> 14:44.788
But, um, the truth is there's
nothing I can do about what he thinks.

14:44.823 --> 14:47.925
The more I thought about it, though, um,

14:47.959 --> 14:51.629
I really just kind of feel bad for Connor.

14:51.663 --> 14:53.797
It must be hard...

14:53.832 --> 14:56.500
... to grow up with all
that judgment around.

14:57.769 --> 14:59.603
I want you to know

14:59.638 --> 15:02.539
that I'm so happy that you're our son.

15:02.574 --> 15:05.676
And there is nothing
that you can't tell us.

15:06.878 --> 15:10.614
Even if it's something you
think we don't want to hear.

15:11.816 --> 15:13.851
Ok?

15:16.721 --> 15:18.489
Ok.

15:19.858 --> 15:23.460
So ten more minutes and
then it's off to bed.

15:34.873 --> 15:37.641
Hey.

15:37.676 --> 15:40.744
- How were the empanadas?
- Uh, what?

15:40.779 --> 15:43.547
Your dad said he and Dani were
trying out some new recipe tonight.

15:43.581 --> 15:48.552
Oh, yeah. Uh, Dad had to work
late so I didn't stay for dinner.

15:48.586 --> 15:49.485
Why didn't you stay and eat with Dani?

15:49.486 --> 15:51.486
I hope you weren't rude. We
raised you better than that.

15:51.623 --> 15:56.527
- Didn't we?
- I wasn't rude. I just have a lot of homework.

15:56.561 --> 15:57.861
I still do.

16:00.932 --> 16:04.501
Ok.

16:04.536 --> 16:06.637
I just, I want to get this project done.

16:06.671 --> 16:11.508
Oh, uh, the band also has this
place they rehearse sometimes,

16:11.543 --> 16:13.677
I think it's called the Woodshed.

16:13.712 --> 16:16.780
Anyway, they wanna take me
after school tomorrow. That cool?

16:16.815 --> 16:18.615
Yeah, as long as your homework's finished.

16:18.650 --> 16:22.553
It's fine with me.

16:22.587 --> 16:25.489
Ok. You hang in there.

16:33.565 --> 16:39.470
I cannot wait for the
supposed burst of energy

16:39.504 --> 16:41.538
that comes with the second trimester.

16:41.573 --> 16:43.640
I was just reading that that's a
thing. Please tell me that's a thing.

16:43.675 --> 16:45.943
That's a thing.

16:45.977 --> 16:50.547
- Look, I'm already showing.
- Oh. Look at that.

16:50.582 --> 16:51.782
Mm...

16:53.785 --> 16:55.519
What?

17:01.593 --> 17:03.494
I'm afraid Mike might
have had something to do

17:03.528 --> 17:05.695
with Ana's disappearance.

17:05.730 --> 17:08.699
What? Why would you even think that?

17:08.733 --> 17:11.468
I spoke to a witness at the
halfway house where she was staying,

17:11.502 --> 17:15.472
and he said he saw Mike yelling
at her the night she disappeared.

17:15.507 --> 17:19.777
Stef, just because Mike fell
off the wagon and yelled at her,

17:19.810 --> 17:24.915
doesn't mean he hurt her. I mean,
she's a really easy person to yell at.

17:24.949 --> 17:26.849
Hell, I've yelled at her sober.

17:26.885 --> 17:29.753
I didn't tell you this,
but when Dani found Mike,

17:29.788 --> 17:32.923
he had blood on his hands. He
said he'd been in a bar fight.

17:32.957 --> 17:36.827
Well, look, you don't even know
if Ana's hurt or where she even is.

17:36.861 --> 17:39.463
They, uh...

17:39.497 --> 17:43.867
They found a Jane Doe that sort
of vaguely fits Ana's description,

17:43.902 --> 17:46.470
but they can't make a positive ID.

17:46.504 --> 17:47.805
So I tracked down her dental records,

17:47.839 --> 17:50.774
but I have not turned
them over to the coroner...

17:50.809 --> 17:55.612
... because Jane Doe's
death was ruled a homicide,

17:55.647 --> 18:00.417
and if it is Ana, I could very
well be linking Mike to a murder.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.557
Oh, Stef, come on. I mean... you know Mike.

18:06.591 --> 18:11.829
I know Mike. I trust him implicitly.
I trust him with our kids.

18:11.863 --> 18:13.630
He's not capable of something like that.

18:13.665 --> 18:17.701
Mike would do anything
to defend his family.

18:17.735 --> 18:20.604
She was threatening us, Lena,
she was threatening all of us.

18:20.638 --> 18:25.442
People... you never know
what they're capable of doing,

18:25.477 --> 18:27.711
trust me, especially given
the right circumstances.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.615
Well, honey, I think that...

18:31.649 --> 18:33.884
... you have to turn over those records.

18:35.653 --> 18:37.821
Either way, you need to know the truth.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.529
- How much further?
- Well, it depends how far you wanna go.

18:50.563 --> 18:54.300
Well, I thought we were
going to, like, the Woodshed.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.502
Oh...

18:56.536 --> 18:59.471
The Woodshed isn't really
a place, it's more a...

18:59.506 --> 19:01.273
I don't know, a state of mind.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.675
What's that supposed to mean?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.644
It's something jazz musicians used to do.

19:05.679 --> 19:08.280
Get away from your life for
a little while, mix things up,

19:08.315 --> 19:10.482
get rid of distractions, really
get into a piece of music.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.651
I've never heard of that before.

19:12.686 --> 19:14.826
Wait, did I just school
Mr. Music on something?

19:15.137 --> 19:17.231
Not bad for a high school drop-out.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.508
All right.

19:27.346 --> 19:29.113
Ok, so where do you wanna start?

19:29.148 --> 19:31.215
Look at this view. You're missing it.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.552
Yeah. It's nice. What are we thinking... ?

19:34.586 --> 19:38.189
I mean it! Seriously,
quit trying to force it.

19:38.223 --> 19:40.558
- Can't we just be in the moment?
- These might help.

19:40.592 --> 19:42.460
Oh, no, thanks. I'm not
really a brownie guy.

19:42.494 --> 19:47.298
Uh, no, dude. These are special brownies.

19:47.332 --> 19:49.286
It's up to you, man,

19:49.287 --> 19:51.827
but some of our best stuff
was written up here like this.

19:52.471 --> 19:55.473
Come on, give "Brooding Brandon" a day off.

19:55.507 --> 19:58.543
Yeah, to quote the great Bob Marley,

19:58.577 --> 20:00.578
"Don't Worry, Be Happy."

20:00.612 --> 20:03.381
Actually, it was Bobby
McFerrin who wrote that song.

20:03.415 --> 20:07.552
Yeah, Marley died in '81 and that
song came out in the late '80s.

20:07.586 --> 20:11.155
It was actually the first a cappella
song to reach number one on the charts,

20:11.190 --> 20:15.426
- which is pretty cool.
- Dude, trust me. You need this.

20:15.460 --> 20:16.627
Bad.

20:34.513 --> 20:39.183
- Hey. Hey, so, I...
- I was just thinking about you.

20:45.657 --> 20:48.492
Um, hey.

20:48.527 --> 20:50.461
Is there someplace you
and I can go and talk?

20:50.495 --> 20:52.663
Why? Are you breaking up with me?

20:52.698 --> 20:54.532
No, no!

20:54.566 --> 20:57.368
But, to be honest with you,

20:57.402 --> 21:01.305
I didn't really think we were
together, you know, officially.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.441
Of course we were together.

21:03.475 --> 21:07.144
I wasn't hooking up with anyone else.

21:07.179 --> 21:10.248
- Were you?
- No.

21:10.282 --> 21:12.550
I feel like you get me.

21:12.584 --> 21:16.587
Even more than my friends.
Like, you see the real me.

21:22.494 --> 21:27.465
I've been thinking... I
think we should tell people.

21:27.499 --> 21:30.368
Do you think we can keep this on
the DL just a little bit longer?

21:30.402 --> 21:32.336
I don't wanna hurt Emma's feelings.

21:32.371 --> 21:35.473
I mean, we just broke up.

21:35.507 --> 21:37.475
I want give her some time to...

21:37.509 --> 21:39.477
I thought she broke up with you.

21:39.511 --> 21:41.379
It's complicated.

21:41.413 --> 21:42.613
She kind of wants to get back together.

21:42.648 --> 21:45.249
I just don't want to feel any worse.

21:46.385 --> 21:49.420
- Is that cool?
- Ok.

21:49.454 --> 21:53.591
Yeah, sure. I get it, no biggie.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.259
We wait.

21:56.461 --> 21:58.329
There's no me...

21:59.464 --> 22:01.165
... without you.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.135
You're the glue...

22:04.603 --> 22:07.338
... in this zoo.

22:07.372 --> 22:10.474
Be my boo.

22:10.509 --> 22:12.610
Haters! This is supposed
to be a safe space.

22:12.644 --> 22:16.580
Ugh! I can't believe how messed up I feel.

22:16.615 --> 22:20.484
- That was hella strong.
- Yeah, damn. Me, too.

22:20.519 --> 22:23.254
How you holding up, Keys?

22:25.457 --> 22:29.393
- What?
- How you holding up?

22:32.664 --> 22:37.401
Here. Have some water.

22:39.671 --> 22:41.238
Let's play a game.

22:42.441 --> 22:44.308
I'll say a word and you say the first thing

22:44.343 --> 22:46.644
- that comes to your mind. Ok?
- Ok.

22:46.678 --> 22:50.247
Ocean.

22:51.516 --> 22:54.218
- Salt.
- Sky.

22:55.587 --> 22:57.521
- Clouds.
- Love.

23:00.225 --> 23:03.160
Don't think about it. Love.

23:04.196 --> 23:05.529
- Lust.
- Sex.

23:05.564 --> 23:07.264
Guilt.

23:07.299 --> 23:10.301
You associate love with lust,

23:10.335 --> 23:13.371
but sex with guilt? Interesting.

23:13.405 --> 23:15.373
I gotta go to the bathroom.

23:15.407 --> 23:18.509
I just, I'll be right...

23:18.543 --> 23:19.577
be back.

23:34.426 --> 23:37.561
Maybe... maybe you
should get ready for work.

23:37.596 --> 23:41.432
- I don't want you to be late.
- I don't want to stop.

23:41.466 --> 23:43.234
Oh.

23:44.469 --> 23:45.503
What about probation?

23:47.606 --> 23:51.275
You know what you said about me and Jude

23:51.309 --> 23:54.545
not having any control over our lives?

23:56.648 --> 23:58.449
You're right.

24:00.318 --> 24:01.452
I'm tired of it.

24:03.188 --> 24:05.322
I get to control this.

24:05.357 --> 24:07.191
Hey.

24:09.227 --> 24:10.261
I love you.

24:13.498 --> 24:15.332
And this is what I want.

24:34.653 --> 24:37.254
You ok, buddy?

25:35.614 --> 25:38.415
You ok?

25:38.450 --> 25:40.451
- I can't...
- You don't have to...

25:40.485 --> 25:41.585
Come here.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.554
No, stop it! Stop!

25:43.588 --> 25:47.258
What's wrong?

25:49.661 --> 25:53.230
Sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do this.

26:19.005 --> 26:21.206
- Are you ok?
- Not really. No.

26:21.241 --> 26:24.209
I ate a pot brownie, and I'm freaking out.

26:24.244 --> 26:27.880
Is that normal? I don't
feel normal. I feel nervous.

26:27.914 --> 26:31.950
Have you had pot before? I feel
like you haven't, which is smart.

26:31.985 --> 26:34.019
But, you know, you guys told us to, uh,

26:34.054 --> 26:36.021
call if we ever need a ride home.

26:36.056 --> 26:37.289
I shouldn't have called. I'm sorry.

26:37.324 --> 26:40.092
No, Brandon, I'm glad you did.

26:40.126 --> 26:43.095
It's ok.

26:43.129 --> 26:46.198
Some people can get anxious or paranoid.

26:46.232 --> 26:47.933
You never know how it's
going to affect you.

26:47.967 --> 26:50.369
It'll wear off, but until it does,

26:50.403 --> 26:53.105
I'm here, ok? So just breathe.

26:55.408 --> 26:59.945
- We're gonna get you through this.
- Ok. Thank you.

26:59.979 --> 27:03.048
You don't have to thank me.

27:03.083 --> 27:07.152
I'm your mom, this is what we do.

27:08.888 --> 27:12.024
- We made it official.
- What?

27:12.058 --> 27:13.892
We're a couple.

27:13.927 --> 27:15.961
Jesus just wants to keep
it under wraps for now

27:15.995 --> 27:18.097
because he doesn't want to hurt Emma.

27:18.131 --> 27:20.165
Guess she wants to get back together.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.303
Spoiler alert: Not gonna happen.

27:24.337 --> 27:27.106
I think it's really sweet of
him to worry about her feelings.

27:27.140 --> 27:31.977
But people talk. The news is gonna get out.

27:32.011 --> 27:36.248
I just, I think it would be better
if she heard it from a friend.

27:36.282 --> 27:39.251
- Like who?
- Like you.

27:39.285 --> 27:42.354
- Me?
- You're friends, right?

27:42.389 --> 27:45.023
Sort of. I mean, through Jesus.

27:45.058 --> 27:47.326
I would tell her myself,
but I barely know her,

27:47.360 --> 27:49.161
so that would make me seem pretty awful.

27:49.195 --> 27:51.897
Ok, look.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.165
I love my brother.

27:53.199 --> 27:57.002
He's my twin and I would totally
give him a kidney, anytime.

27:57.036 --> 28:01.006
But when it comes to
girls, he can be a little...

28:01.040 --> 28:03.175
... all over the place. Not in a bad way.

28:03.209 --> 28:06.211
He's just not very good at
expressing his true feelings.

28:06.246 --> 28:08.847
If he even knows what he's feeling.

28:08.882 --> 28:11.984
Which, most of the time, he
doesn't. He's easily confused.

28:12.018 --> 28:13.285
Are you saying he doesn't like me?

28:13.319 --> 28:15.988
No, he does. I think he does.

28:16.022 --> 28:18.090
Then what are you trying to say?

28:18.124 --> 28:20.225
Do you not want me to date your brother?

28:20.260 --> 28:22.294
- I thought we were friends.
- We are!

28:22.328 --> 28:26.098
And I am so stoked for
you to date my brother.

28:26.132 --> 28:29.134
I just... I don't want you to get hurt.

28:29.169 --> 28:30.302
That's sweet.

28:30.336 --> 28:32.905
But the person you should
be worried about is Emma.

28:32.939 --> 28:36.074
I mean, it's totally up to you
if you want to tell her or not.

28:36.109 --> 28:41.046
But I think it would be an awesome
opportunity to do something nice.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.183
Girls have to stand up
for each other, right?

28:56.296 --> 29:00.332
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. No.

29:00.366 --> 29:03.268
Can you tell me what happened?

29:03.303 --> 29:05.971
I don't know. I just...

29:06.039 --> 29:09.975
No... I don't really want to talk about it.

29:12.111 --> 29:15.113
It's ok if you're not
ready. I'm not in any hurry.

29:15.148 --> 29:17.115
No, I know.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.851
Thank you.

29:24.023 --> 29:26.024
I'm late.

29:26.059 --> 29:28.193
Callie, please look at me.

29:30.997 --> 29:35.133
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

29:39.138 --> 29:41.139
Everything is fine.

29:51.251 --> 29:54.887
I really don't know his schedule,
since we're not partners anymore.

29:54.921 --> 29:57.521
But you can find out, right,
if he's working a double?

29:57.522 --> 29:58.522
It can't be that hard.

29:59.058 --> 30:04.162
- What's this about, Dani?
- He canceled dinner last night with Brandon.

30:04.197 --> 30:06.331
- He wouldn't normally do that.
- It's a dinner...

30:06.366 --> 30:09.968
It's not just a dinner. He
leaves early, he comes home late.

30:10.003 --> 30:12.204
I don't know what to think.

30:13.072 --> 30:15.140
Unless...

30:17.243 --> 30:21.346
- Unless he's drinking again?
- I haven't smelled anything on him,

30:21.381 --> 30:24.049
but I don't know, maybe he's
getting high some other way.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.084
What, Mike? Drugs? No. That's...

30:26.119 --> 30:29.955
- Maybe he's just having an affair.
- He's not a cheater, Dani.

30:29.989 --> 30:34.026
- I don't know what to tell you.
- I hope you're right.

30:34.060 --> 30:37.296
But if he is using or drinking again,

30:37.330 --> 30:39.998
it's something we're all
going to have to deal with.

30:40.033 --> 30:44.202
So if you won't check up on
him for me, do it for Brandon.

30:49.142 --> 30:52.311
Hey, did you... did those records
go over to the coroner yet?

30:52.345 --> 30:54.179
Oh, yeah. The guy just left. Why?

30:54.213 --> 30:57.215
Nothing. Never mind. Thank you.

31:08.971 --> 31:09.897
Once I got to Paris,

31:10.374 --> 31:15.244
I just knew I was going to be a
different person for the rest of my life.

31:15.279 --> 31:19.248
The things that we do, the choices we make,

31:19.283 --> 31:24.320
- they change us, you know?
- Yeah. That's so cool.

31:24.354 --> 31:27.156
It's like you're cars on a train.

31:27.191 --> 31:30.426
Well, not on a train, cars of a train.

31:30.460 --> 31:32.495
They're all... they're
all in the right order

31:32.529 --> 31:35.298
and they're all just going down the track,

31:35.332 --> 31:39.468
you gotta get them into
the right station. You know?

31:39.503 --> 31:42.171
Sure.

31:42.206 --> 31:43.506
Unless you pull into the wrong station,

31:43.540 --> 31:45.508
and then everything's
just screwed up forever

31:45.542 --> 31:48.444
because now you're in Moscow and
you wanna be in St. Petersburg,

31:48.478 --> 31:50.313
and nobody wants to be in Moscow,

31:50.347 --> 31:52.481
unless you're, like, Raskolnikov,

31:52.516 --> 31:56.252
and you're trying to escape
the anguish of what you did.

31:56.286 --> 31:59.322
Maybe we shouldn't talk about
Crime and Punishment right now.

31:59.356 --> 32:01.424
It's a little heavy.

32:01.458 --> 32:07.330
- But not. You know?
- I do.

32:09.466 --> 32:12.401
Girl, what'd that table ever do to you?

32:12.436 --> 32:14.170
Callie.

32:18.275 --> 32:20.543
- Girl, where you at?
- Sorry.

32:20.577 --> 32:22.545
Sit and spill.

32:27.284 --> 32:32.121
- You and Wyatt get in a fight?
- No. Not at all.

32:32.155 --> 32:35.124
- Though he might think so.
- Why?

32:35.158 --> 32:37.593
I was gonna have sex with
Wyatt today for the first time.

32:37.628 --> 32:41.397
I know it's a parole violation,

32:41.431 --> 32:43.399
but they can't tell me
what to do with my own body.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.468
- I agree.
- Then why the face?

32:45.502 --> 32:49.238
- I'm just surprised.
- Because of Brandon?

32:49.273 --> 32:52.441
No, I just figured you and
Wyatt were already doing it.

32:52.476 --> 32:55.478
Oh. Uh, no.

32:55.512 --> 32:59.548
No, and we didn't today either.

33:00.550 --> 33:03.219
'Cause I kind of freaked out.

33:03.253 --> 33:05.521
- Why?
- I don't know.

33:05.555 --> 33:09.392
All of a sudden, I... I couldn't breathe.

33:09.426 --> 33:15.298
And I felt like he was
gonna crush me or something.

33:15.332 --> 33:17.133
Maybe you were just nervous.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.568
Or maybe I'm still in love with Brandon.

33:21.405 --> 33:23.572
- I thought you were over him.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

33:23.607 --> 33:26.108
But maybe I'm not.

33:26.143 --> 33:28.244
I never felt like that
when we were together.

33:28.278 --> 33:32.348
- Were you ever with Brandon?
- No.

33:32.382 --> 33:35.484
- No, not like that.
- Don't give up on Wyatt.

33:35.519 --> 33:40.256
- He's a good one.
- I'm not. I'm not.

33:43.627 --> 33:47.129
We should get back to work.

34:04.314 --> 34:07.216
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.284
You all right?

34:18.161 --> 34:20.295
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

34:20.330 --> 34:22.130
I just, I thought I saw someone I know.

34:29.505 --> 34:31.574
Brandon, why did you call me?

34:31.608 --> 34:37.213
I mean, I'm glad that you did. But,
you know, you have other options.

34:37.246 --> 34:39.581
Well, Jude and the twins can't drive. So...

34:42.418 --> 34:44.453
Neither can Callie, come to think of it.

34:44.487 --> 34:47.322
And, I don't know, um...

34:47.357 --> 34:53.295
Mom tends to overreact to things, and...

34:53.330 --> 34:56.197
I was just feeling so
anxious, I couldn't imagine

34:56.233 --> 34:58.567
dealing with her yelling, on top of it all.

34:58.602 --> 35:03.205
She only yells at you
because she loves you so much.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.542
- I know.
- We both do. Unconditionally.

35:09.112 --> 35:12.348
Honey, it's ok. You made a mistake.

35:12.382 --> 35:14.316
Tomorrow everything's
gonna be back to normal.

35:14.351 --> 35:19.388
No, things will... never be normal again.

35:19.423 --> 35:22.291
This is just part of growing up.

35:22.325 --> 35:25.528
- It's ok.
- No. It's not.

35:29.199 --> 35:33.269
- I slept with Dani.
- Dani?

35:44.760 --> 35:46.461
- Hey. Heading out?
- Hey.

35:46.495 --> 35:47.695
I thought you were still pulling doubles.

35:47.730 --> 35:50.799
- Luckily, no. I did my time.
- Good for you.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.600
I gotta run.

35:52.635 --> 35:55.603
I don't want to risk the wrath of
Dani by being late for date night.

35:55.638 --> 35:57.872
I hear you. I'm heading
out, too. Have a good night.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.474
Bye.

36:02.678 --> 36:05.780
- You told Emma about Hayley?
- You're welcome.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.750
- What, you think you were doing me a favor?
- Yes.

36:08.784 --> 36:10.752
Emma's really upset. Why would
you want to hurt her like that?

36:10.786 --> 36:13.688
Why would you? Why would you
tell Hayley you were a couple,

36:13.722 --> 36:14.485
and not tell Emma?

36:14.486 --> 36:17.497
So you could string her along in
case you change your mind again?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.661
- It's none of your business.
- And whether you like it or not,

36:19.695 --> 36:23.665
your behavior, especially when it comes
to girls on the dance team, affects me.

36:23.699 --> 36:25.667
You wanna protect your
little spot on the dance team?

36:25.701 --> 36:27.735
News flash: You're a terrible dancer.

36:27.770 --> 36:31.506
Well, you're a terrible brother
and an even worse boyfriend.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.295
You broke Lexi's heart, and now Emma's,

36:33.296 --> 36:34.976
and I'm pretty sure Hayley is next in line.

36:34.977 --> 36:38.513
So, you know what? I'm taking a
stand for womankind. Deal with it.

36:38.547 --> 36:41.516
Don't get all high and mighty.
This isn't about you taking a stand.

36:41.550 --> 36:43.751
This is about you trying to
be like all those other girls.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.721
- That's not true.
- Oh, please, have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?

36:46.755 --> 36:50.625
If you wanna be a giant pain in my
ass, at least admit why you're doing it.

36:50.659 --> 36:52.861
'Cause you wanna fit in.
'Cause you're a sheep!

37:00.636 --> 37:03.671
- Hey.
- What was all that slamming?

37:03.706 --> 37:05.773
Your brother and sister.

37:09.512 --> 37:11.613
- I feel a lot better.
- I'm glad.

37:11.647 --> 37:15.783
You can't tell anyone
what happened with Dani.

37:15.818 --> 37:20.622
- You have to promise me.
- What Dani did to you is not right.

37:20.656 --> 37:23.791
- It's illegal. And I can't...
- Listen to me.

37:26.762 --> 37:27.795
Mom will kill her.

37:27.830 --> 37:31.533
And Dad might start drinking again,

37:31.567 --> 37:33.868
or who knows?

37:35.771 --> 37:38.473
Please, don't tell anyone.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.808
- You can't ask me to do that.
- Please!

37:42.478 --> 37:44.679
They'll never look at
me the same way again.

38:01.764 --> 38:02.797
Can I join you?

38:11.774 --> 38:15.577
Remember when we lived
with that really mean kid

38:15.611 --> 38:18.780
with the weird eyebrow, and
he challenged us to play?

38:18.814 --> 38:21.783
We lost so bad.

38:21.817 --> 38:26.688
And the next time we played, you figured
out that thing, that thing at the end.

38:26.722 --> 38:31.826
You know? His character stopped
fighting and did that, like, crazy dance.

38:31.860 --> 38:34.596
It was hilarious.

38:34.630 --> 38:36.631
We're a good team.

38:36.665 --> 38:39.500
You're clearly the brains of the operation.

40:38.721 --> 40:40.722
Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message.
