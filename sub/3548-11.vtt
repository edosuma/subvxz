WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.035
BREE MOVED IN...

00:04.035 --> 00:07.007
YOU CAN STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.
 MIKE WENT TO REHAB...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.779
I WILL FIX THIS.

00:08.779 --> 00:11.011
CARLOS FACED
A PERMANENT ILLNESS...

00:11.011 --> 00:14.145
SHE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU
BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR SIGHT.
 YOU DON'T KNOW GABY.

00:14.145 --> 00:16.146
DYLAN HAD QUESTIONS
ABOUT HER FATHER...

00:16.146 --> 00:18.189
THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

00:18.189 --> 00:21.392
ABOUT THAT MAN
IS HE WAS A MONSTER.
 WHY WOULD YOU NOT
TELL ME THAT?

00:21.392 --> 00:23.294
AND ADAM UNCOVERED A SECRET...

00:23.294 --> 00:26.157
YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.299
NOW I FIND OUT
IT WAS YOURS.

00:28.299 --> 00:31.502
THAT ONE PERSON WISHED
HE HADN'T.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.439
(Mary Alice) KATHERINE MAYFAIR

00:38.439 --> 00:43.043
WAS NOT THE KIND OF WOMAN
WHO LIKED TO RELIVE THE PAST.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.246
BUT WHEN HER HUSBAND ADAM
LEFT HER,

00:45.246 --> 00:49.220
KATHERINE'S LIFE
BEGAN TO UNRAVEL,

00:49.220 --> 00:51.152
AND THE MISTAKES OF HER YOUTH

00:51.152 --> 00:54.155
STARTED TO FLASH
THROUGH HER MIND.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.658
SHE THOUGHT OF WAYNE DAVIS,
THE FIRST MAN SHE MARRIED...

00:57.658 --> 01:01.462
AND THE FIRST TIME
HE HAD HIT HER.

01:01.462 --> 01:05.266
SHE THOUGHT OF HOW SINCERELY
HE APOLOGIZED...

01:05.266 --> 01:08.799
AND HOW MEANINGLESS
HIS APOLOGIES WERE...

01:08.799 --> 01:10.801
AND HOW SHE FINALLY DECIDED...
 (grunts)

01:10.801 --> 01:12.673
(thud)
 TO HIT BACK.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.075
THESE WERE THE THOUGHTS GOING
THROUGH KATHERINE'S MIND....

01:15.075 --> 01:16.577
(knock on door)

01:16.577 --> 01:18.749
WHEN HER FRIENDS
AND NEIGHBORS ARRIVED...

01:21.112 --> 01:23.083
BEARING GIFTS.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.186
WELL, HELLO THERE.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.487
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.189
WE BROUGHT YOU MUFFINS.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.460
AND JAM.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.792
OKAY, UH,
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

01:31.792 --> 01:34.265
WELL, WE HEARD
YOU WERE HAVING A ROUGH TIME.

01:34.265 --> 01:37.268
SO WE JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

01:37.268 --> 01:40.171
AH, SO WORD IS OUT
THAT ADAM'S LEFT ME,

01:40.171 --> 01:43.204
AND YOU THOUGHT
THATMUFFINS ANDJAM

01:43.204 --> 01:46.237
WOULD HELP ME
PICK UP THE PIECES.

01:46.237 --> 01:48.579
THE JAM WAS BREE'S IDEA.

01:48.579 --> 01:51.582
SUSAN!
 I WANTED TO BRING FLOWERS,
AND I WAS SHOT DOWN.

01:51.582 --> 01:54.585
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
 KATHERINE, WE DIDN'T
COME HERE TO UPSET YOU.

01:54.585 --> 01:57.788
NO, WE THOUGHT THAT YOU JUST
MIGHT NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

01:57.788 --> 02:00.851
NO, YOU JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D GET THE JUICY DETAILS.
 NO, WE CAME HERE.

02:00.851 --> 02:04.895
WE WANTED TO HELP YOU, TO FIX
YOU LUNCH OR CLEAN YOUR HOUSE.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.330
OR OFFER UP OUR OWN HOUSES
FOR YOU TO CLEAN,

02:10.330 --> 02:12.203
IF THAT'S YOUR THING.

02:12.203 --> 02:13.504
I'M FINE, TRULY,

02:13.504 --> 02:15.506
AND IDOAPPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

02:15.506 --> 02:18.239
BUT... YOU KNOW...

02:18.239 --> 02:19.139
(sighs)

02:19.139 --> 02:21.172
OKAY.

02:21.172 --> 02:23.514
I TOLD THEM
YOU WEREN'T INTO JAM.

02:23.514 --> 02:25.176
SUSAN!

02:26.477 --> 02:29.250
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY,

02:29.250 --> 02:31.522
BUT GIVEN WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT YOU AND ADAM,

02:31.522 --> 02:34.525
I'M SURPRISEDHEWAS
THE ONE TO DO THE LEAVING.

02:34.525 --> 02:36.657
WELL, BREE, THE TRUTH IS...

02:38.459 --> 02:41.161
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.694
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,

02:43.694 --> 02:46.337
DON'T KEEP YOUR FEELINGS
BOTTLED UP.

02:46.337 --> 02:48.339
YOU'VE GOT TO LET 'EM OUT.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.572
I'LL DO THAT.

03:12.863 --> 03:14.825
YES, KATHERINE MAYFAIR

03:14.825 --> 03:18.569
WAS NOT A WOMAN
WHO LIKED TO RELIVE THE PAST.

03:18.569 --> 03:23.234
BUT LATELY,
HER LIFE HAD BEGUN TO UNRAVEL.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.236
AND SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING

03:25.236 --> 03:27.238
OF ALL THE MISTAKES
SHE HAD MADE...

03:27.238 --> 03:28.679
(crying)

03:28.679 --> 03:31.442
AND ESPECIALLY...

03:31.442 --> 03:45.696
THE ONES SHE HAD BURIED.

03:45.696 --> 03:48.629
IT HAPPENED ONCE A WEEK
ON WISTERIA LANE

03:48.629 --> 03:50.561
LIKE CLOCKWORK.

03:50.561 --> 03:53.264
THE FAITHFUL WOULD EMERGE
FROM THEIR HOMES

03:53.264 --> 03:55.366
IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST...

03:55.366 --> 03:59.270
WITH THEIR FAMILY BIBLES...

03:59.270 --> 04:03.314
AND THEIR ROSARY BEADS...

04:03.314 --> 04:05.316
AND THEY WOULD HEAD OFF

04:05.316 --> 04:07.318
TO THEIR VARIOUS
HOUSES OF WORSHIP,

04:07.318 --> 04:09.680
PASSING
BY A CERTAIN NONBELIEVER

04:09.680 --> 04:13.284
WHO HAD NEVER TAKEN AN INTEREST
IN THEIR RITUAL.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.889
BUT ONTHISDAY,

04:18.889 --> 04:23.334
LYNETTE SCAVO,
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE,

04:23.334 --> 04:25.336
WAS STRUCK BY SOMETHING...

04:25.336 --> 04:26.837
GET THE BALL.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.839
SOMETHING SHE WOULD
LATER THINK OF

04:28.839 --> 04:30.871
AS DIVINE INSPIRATION.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.404
(man calling play-by-play
on TV)

04:33.404 --> 04:35.406
WE SHOULD GO TO CHURCH.

04:35.406 --> 04:37.878
WHAT? WHY? WHAT DIDWEDO?

04:37.878 --> 04:40.811
AH, IT'S JUST...

04:40.811 --> 04:42.313
(turns TV off)

04:42.313 --> 04:44.315
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY,

04:44.315 --> 04:46.817
AND WE HAVE A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

04:46.817 --> 04:50.791
DON'T YOU THINK WE OWE
THE BIG GUY A LITTLE FACE TIME?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.793
FINE, FINE.
WE'LL GO TO CHURCH...

04:52.793 --> 04:55.426
NEXT WEEK.
 (turns TV on)

04:55.426 --> 04:57.568
TOM...
 (turns TV off)

04:57.568 --> 05:00.631
I'M SERIOUS.
 WHAT'S THE RUSH? GOD WILL
STILL BE THERE NEXT SUNDAY.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.633
THE PISTONS,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

05:02.633 --> 05:05.576
THEY LOSE TODAY,
THEY'RE GONE FOR GOOD.
 SO I'M CLEAR,

05:05.576 --> 05:08.308
YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED
WITH SAVING YOUR ETERNAL SOUL

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
BECAUSE THE PISTONS
HAVE NO DEFENSE?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
(sighs) OKAY, LOOK.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.446
YOU DIDN'T GROW UP
GOING TO CHURCH. I DID.

05:15.446 --> 05:18.389
MY PARENTS DRAGGED ME
TO ST. ANTHONY'S EVERY SUNDAY.

05:18.389 --> 05:19.950
I'VE DONE MY TIME.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.452
WELL, I HAVEN'T.

05:21.452 --> 05:24.495
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
I WOULD LIKE ANSWERED.

05:24.495 --> 05:27.027
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT GOD OR JESUS,

05:27.027 --> 05:30.861
AND OUR KIDS DON'T EITHER.
 WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO CHURCH TO LEARNTHATSTUFF.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.903
YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT JESUS.

05:32.903 --> 05:36.336
SEE?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.069
HE'S THE GUY
WHO HELPS OUT SANTA CLAUS.

05:41.472 --> 05:46.477
GET DRESSED, KIDS.
WE'RE GOING TO CHURCH.

05:52.022 --> 05:54.525
MM-HMM. RIGHT.
 (hammering in distance)

05:54.525 --> 05:57.057
ORSON,
I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.532
SERVICES DON'T START
TILL 10:30.
 YES, BUT I'M SURE EDNA FLETCHER
HAS BEEN THERE SINCE 9:00,

06:01.532 --> 06:02.933
KISSING UP
TO REVEREND SYKES.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.936
IS THIS ABOUT
THE LADIES' AUXILIARY AGAIN?
 DAMN RIGHT.

06:05.936 --> 06:08.939
BREE, PLEASE,
SUCH LANGUAGE ON A SUNDAY.
 I AM SORRY,
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE

06:08.939 --> 06:12.072
THAT HE DOESN'T LET HER
CHAIR THAT COMMITTEE.
 WELL, HOW COULD HE? YOU PLAN
EVERY PANCAKE BREAKFAST.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.445
YOU ORGANIZE EVERY BAKE SALE.
YOU'D BE A SAINT

06:14.445 --> 06:16.447
IF OUR CHURCH BELIEVED
IN THAT SORT OF HOGWASH.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.449
EXACTLY, AND ALL THE WHILE,
WHERE WAS EDNA?

06:18.449 --> 06:20.751
LOUNGING AROUND IN ZIMBABWE
IN THE PEACE CORPS.

06:20.751 --> 06:23.814
SHE WON'T LET ANY OF US
FORGET IT.
 WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.457
EDNA'S "CURING THE VILLAGE
OF DYSENTERY" STORY

06:26.457 --> 06:28.589
HAS LONG SINCE LOST
ITS NOVELTY.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.422
OH, LYNETTE. HI.
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

06:31.422 --> 06:33.424
WHAT ARE YOU
ALL DRESSED UP FOR?

06:33.424 --> 06:36.927
WELL, I DECIDED
I SHOULD GO TO CHURCH TODAY.

06:36.927 --> 06:38.929
YEAH,
TOM SAID THE SAME THING.

06:38.929 --> 06:41.432
ANYWAY, SINCE YOU'RE THE MOST
RELIGIOUS PERSON I KNOW,

06:41.432 --> 06:44.775
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD
TAKE US TO YOUR CHURCH.
 I WOULD LOVE THAT.

06:44.775 --> 06:47.778
WE'RE--WE'RE LEAVING RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN FOLLOW US.

06:47.778 --> 06:51.411
GREAT! JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
TO SELL TOM ON THE IDEA.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.414
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.
 OH, DON'T GO CATHOLIC.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.717
ALL THAT STANDING AND KNEELING
AND GENUFLECTING--

06:56.717 --> 06:58.719
I GO FOR WORSHIP,
NOT A WORKOUT.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.722
MM. NOT TO MENTION THE INCENSE,
WHICH SMELLS GOOD AT FIRST

07:01.722 --> 07:04.124
UNTIL YOU FEEL YOUR BREAKFAST
COMING BACK UP.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.126
OKAY. (chuckles nervously)

07:06.126 --> 07:08.128
WELL, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.431
OH, THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I'M GOING TO CHURCH.

07:13.664 --> 07:15.766
BY THE WAY, WHATAMI NOW?

07:15.766 --> 07:17.608
PRESBYTERIAN.

07:17.608 --> 07:19.740
RIGHT.

07:22.613 --> 07:25.576
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

07:28.619 --> 07:31.051
OH, SHOOT.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.623
DID I MISS MASS?

07:32.623 --> 07:34.925
WAS IT AT 9:00?

07:34.925 --> 07:37.457
YES, GABRIELLE.
9:00 MASS IS STILL AT 9:00.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.660
OH, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.232
UH, FATHER,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

07:42.232 --> 07:45.596
OF COURSE. I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
EXPECTING YOU TO COME BY.

07:45.596 --> 07:46.967
WHY?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.469
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED SOME COMFORTING

07:49.469 --> 07:51.141
AFTER YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.103
OH, THAT.

07:53.103 --> 07:55.105
YEAH,
I WAS A LITTLE BLUE,

07:55.105 --> 07:57.608
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I'VE BOUNCED BACK.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.650
REALLY?

07:59.650 --> 08:02.653
OKAY, THIS MAY COME
AS A LITTLE SHOCK TO YOU...

08:02.653 --> 08:06.256
(singsong voice) BUT GUESS
WHO'S GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

08:06.256 --> 08:07.758
(normal voice)
AND I WAS THINKING,

08:07.758 --> 08:10.561
MAYBE YOU COULD PERFORM
THE CEREMONY.

08:12.162 --> 08:15.265
IS TUESDAY GOOD FOR YOU?

08:15.265 --> 08:16.597
UH...

08:16.597 --> 08:19.570
VICTOR'S ONLY BEEN DEAD
TWO WEEKS.

08:19.570 --> 08:22.573
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I'M NO GOOD SINGLE.

08:22.573 --> 08:24.905
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.678
WELL, WHO IS THIS MAN?
DID YOU JUST MEET HIM?

08:27.678 --> 08:29.880
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S CARLOS.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.282
CARLOS? I-I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE EVEN SPEAKING.

08:32.282 --> 08:35.284
OH, YEAH. WE BUMPED INTO
EACH OTHER A FEW MONTHS AGO,

08:35.284 --> 08:37.748
AND WE JUST FELL IN LOVE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

08:37.748 --> 08:39.750
UH, A FEW MONTHS AGO?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.922
BUT YOU WERE MARRIED
SIX MONTHS AGO.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.956
BOY, YOU ARE JUST DETERMINED
TO MAKE THIS AWKWARD, AREN'T YA?

08:45.956 --> 08:47.958
OH, GABRIELLE.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.561
OKAY, LOOK,
IN THE EYES OF THE CHURCH,

08:50.561 --> 08:51.932
CARLOS AND I
WERE NEVER DIVORCED.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.635
TECHNICALLY,
THE AFFAIR WAS WITH VICTOR,

08:54.635 --> 08:55.906
AND GOD SMOTE HIM.

08:55.906 --> 08:57.638
SO WE'RE GOOD.

08:58.739 --> 09:02.272
(scoffs) ALL RIGHT, YES,
I'VE BEEN A BAD CATHOLIC.

09:02.272 --> 09:05.275
ENOUGH WITH THE GUILT THING.
ARE YOU GONNA MARRY US OR NOT?

09:05.275 --> 09:08.148
(sighs) FINE,
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE

09:08.148 --> 09:11.181
TO STAY MARRIED TO CARLOS
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

09:11.181 --> 09:13.684
ABSOLUTELY.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.557
OH, BUT IF I DON'T,
I PROMISE YOU,

09:17.557 --> 09:19.059
I WILL CHANGE RELIGIONS.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.161
THANK YOU.

09:31.141 --> 09:34.144
SORRY.
 NO, THIS IS GOOD.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.607
ACCOUNTANTS ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT
WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THE TIME

09:36.607 --> 09:38.709
TO DEVELOP
A SOPHISTICATED FILING SYSTEM.

09:38.709 --> 09:41.581
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS SARCASTIC
WITH YOUR CLIENTS?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.914
NOPE,
JUST MY FAVORITE COUSIN.

09:43.914 --> 09:45.916
I SO APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING US OUT.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.619
MIKE WOULD BE DOING OUR TAXES,
BUT HE'S OFF...

09:48.619 --> 09:49.960
GETTING BETTER.
 (sighs)

09:49.960 --> 09:53.193
MOM TOLD ME. BESIDES,
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE WORK.

09:53.193 --> 09:56.727
YEAH, I WAS SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR JOB.

09:56.727 --> 09:58.729
YOU KNOW,
EVER SINCE N.A.F.T.A.,

09:58.729 --> 10:01.902
CORPORATE OUTSOURCING HAS BEEN
THE BANE OF THE AMERICAN WORKER.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.233
(sighs)

10:03.233 --> 10:06.276
IS THAT RIGHT? I HEARD
SOMEBODY SAY THAT ON N.P.R.,

10:06.276 --> 10:08.779
AND I JUST KEEP REPEATING IT
TO PEOPLE.

10:08.779 --> 10:11.782
ACTUALLY, I WISH I COULD BLAME
LOSING MY JOB ON N.A.F.T.A.,

10:11.782 --> 10:15.115
BUT IT REALLY HAS
MORE TO DO WITH CHLOE.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.747
MY BOSS' DAUGHTER.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.218
OH, TIM.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.892
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE GOT SO MAD.
I MEAN, SHEWAS18.

10:21.892 --> 10:24.695
OKAY,
SO BACK TO THESE RECEIPTS.

10:24.695 --> 10:27.197
WHAT IS IT ABOUT A GIRL
IN A CHEERLEADER OUTFIT?

10:27.197 --> 10:29.730
DONE CATCHING UP.
ALL ABOUT ACCOUNTING NOW.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.904
COME ON, SUSAN. YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF CREEP.
 NO, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

10:33.904 --> 10:37.237
I MEAN, 18's LEGAL.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.741
I CHECKED WITH A LAWYER
BEFORE I DID ANYTHING.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.773
THESE RECEIPTS
ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY.

10:42.773 --> 10:46.176
I'D EVEN KNOW WHY I'M HERE.
(chuckles)

10:48.779 --> 10:51.051
(Reverend Sykes)
THIS IS THE NOURISHMENT

10:51.051 --> 10:53.423
EACH SOUL REQUIRES
TO GO FROM ACORN TO OAK.

10:53.423 --> 10:55.886
AND THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BRING US
PEACE IN OUR HEARTS--

10:55.886 --> 10:58.889
THE BLESSED KNOWLEDGE
THAT GOD'S LOVE FOR US

10:58.889 --> 11:01.692
IS AS SURE AS THE SUNLIGHT

11:01.692 --> 11:03.694
AND THAT IT IS ALWAYS SHINING.

11:03.694 --> 11:05.696
WE ONLY NEED SEE IT.

11:05.696 --> 11:07.667
AMEN?
 (congregation) AMEN.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.800
(Reverend Sykes) NOW IF
YOU'LL TAKE OUT YOUR HYMNALS

11:09.800 --> 11:13.704
AND TURN TO PAGE 335.

11:13.704 --> 11:18.178
(whispering)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 I'VE GOT A QUESTION
ABOUT HIS SERMON.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.781
WHAT? NO.
PUT YOUR HAND DOWN.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.784
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SEC.
 LYNETTE, PLEASE,
WE DON'T DO THAT HERE.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.686
UH, YES, CAN I HELP YOU?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.189
HI. (clears throat)
I'M LYNETTE SCAVO.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.794
I'M A FRIEND OF BREE HODGE.
AND YOUR SERMON WAS LOVELY,

11:33.794 --> 11:37.027
ESPECIALLY THE PART
ABOUT THE TREES.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.800
THANK YOU.
 BUT HERE'S
WHERE YOU LOST ME--

11:39.800 --> 11:43.433
"GOD'S LOVE IS
AS SURE AS THE SUNLIGHT."

11:43.433 --> 11:44.935
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

11:44.935 --> 11:47.107
THERE. YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER.
NOW SIT.

11:47.107 --> 11:51.281
THE REASON I ASK IS, THERE ARE
WARS ALL OVER THE WORLD,

11:51.281 --> 11:53.283
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERY MONTH,

11:53.283 --> 11:56.086
SOME DUMB-ASS
WALKS INTO A SCHOOL

11:56.086 --> 11:58.248
AND STARTS
SHOOTING CHILDREN.

11:58.248 --> 12:00.320
SO I'M THINKING, GOD'S LOVE?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.752
NOT SO SURE.

12:01.752 --> 12:05.425
DID SHE JUST SAY
"DUMB-ASS"?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.327
AH, THE ETERNAL QUESTION--

12:07.327 --> 12:10.330
"WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN
TO GOOD PEOPLE?"

12:10.330 --> 12:14.464
WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS,
GOD GAVE US FREE WILL.

12:14.464 --> 12:19.169
MUCH OF THE EVIL IN THE WORLD
IS BROUGHT ON BY MAN HIMSELF.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.872
(gasps) OH, LORD.

12:21.872 --> 12:23.173
YES, LYNETTE?

12:23.173 --> 12:25.846
OKAY, I GIVE YOU THAT ONE.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.818
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TORNADO
THAT JUST HAPPENED?

12:27.818 --> 12:30.280
YOU CAN'T BLAMEMAN
 FOR THAT.

12:30.280 --> 12:34.925
(under breath) GET THE KEYS
READY. WE'LL SLIP OUT THE BACK.
 YOU BRING UP
A BIG THEOLOGICAL ISSUE,

12:34.925 --> 12:37.357
ONE THAT DESERVES
A LOT MORE TIME TO EXPLORE.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.960
WHY DON'T YOU COME TO
OUR TUESDAY NIGHT BIBLE STUDY?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.962
WE CAN DISCUSS IT THEN.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.295
WELL, SURE. I'M EASY.
THANKS.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.875
KATHERINE, DYLAN, HI.
WHAT'S UP?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.877
JULIE AND I HAVE
A STUDY DATE,

12:56.877 --> 13:00.310
AND MY MOM WANTS TO
APOLOGIZE FOR BEING RUDE...

13:00.310 --> 13:02.782
AGAIN.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.985
IS THIS
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.987
YES. YOU WERE
JUST TRYING TO HELP,

13:06.987 --> 13:09.820
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE REACTED
THE WAY I DID.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.122
OH, PLEASE. AFTER WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

13:12.122 --> 13:14.895
NO ONE IS JUDGING.
COME ON IN.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.897
I'LL PUT ON SOME COFFEE.

13:16.897 --> 13:20.931
OH, UM, THIS IS MY COUSIN TIM.
TIM, THIS IS THE NEIGHBORS.

13:20.931 --> 13:22.302
MRS. DAVIS?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.935
DAVIS? NOBODY'S CALLED ME THAT
IN YEARS.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.978
(chuckles)
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?

13:27.978 --> 13:30.380
OH, OF COURSE YOU DO.
THAT'S RIGHT!

13:30.380 --> 13:32.312
THIS IS MY COUSIN TIMMY.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.284
(laughs) HE STAYED WITH US

13:34.284 --> 13:36.516
THAT SUMMER
THAT HE WENT TO BAND CAMP.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.319
OH! YES.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.991
I REMEMBER.

13:40.991 --> 13:43.894
GOSH, YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

13:43.894 --> 13:47.097
YOU, TOO. HOLD IT.
IS THIS LITTLE DYLAN?

13:47.097 --> 13:48.598
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

13:48.598 --> 13:52.202
WOW! THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
YOU WERE PULLING A WAGON.

13:52.202 --> 13:53.964
OH.
 (chuckles)

13:53.964 --> 13:57.968
HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW?
 I TURN 18 NEXT WEEK.

13:57.968 --> 13:59.839
(Tim) REALLY?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.271
18?

14:04.915 --> 14:07.447
JULIE, DYLAN'S HERE!
STUDY TIME!

14:07.447 --> 14:09.849
I'M... SORRY.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.852
THAT WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE
LOUDER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.154
(chuckles nervously)

14:16.026 --> 14:19.859
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

14:19.859 --> 14:22.132
EDIE, IS THAT YOU?

14:22.132 --> 14:24.935
OH, MY GOD.
YOU KNEW IT WAS ME

14:24.935 --> 14:27.437
JUST FROM THE SOUND
OF MY FOOTSTEPS?

14:27.437 --> 14:28.939
NO, FROM YOUR PERFUME.

14:28.939 --> 14:31.641
I SMELLED IT THE MOMENT
YOU HIT THE PARKING LOT.

14:31.641 --> 14:34.905
LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE PISSY.

14:34.905 --> 14:36.947
I'M HERE
TO DO SOMETHING NICE.

14:36.947 --> 14:38.648
REALLY?

14:38.648 --> 14:42.182
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE WHOLE
LOSING-ALL-OF-YOUR-MONEY THING.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.555
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW TORNADO--
CLEARLY NOT MY FAULT.

14:45.555 --> 14:47.217
UM...

14:47.217 --> 14:51.021
ANYWAY, I-I THOUGHT
MAYBETHIS...

14:51.021 --> 14:53.163
WOULD HELP.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.369
IT'S THE DIAMOND BRACELET
YOU GAVE ME.

14:59.369 --> 15:02.002
IT MUST BE WORTH
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

15:02.002 --> 15:05.005
DO YOU THINK YOU STILL HAVE
THE RECEIPT FOR IT?

15:05.005 --> 15:08.038
UH...
I THINK I THREW IT OUT.

15:08.038 --> 15:10.340
OH. WELL, YOU SAID
IT WAS FROM CARTIER, RIGHT?

15:10.340 --> 15:13.543
I'M SURE THEY HAVE
SOME SORT OF RECORD.

15:15.385 --> 15:17.187
CARLOS?

15:17.187 --> 15:19.919
ACTUALLY,
THEBOXWAS FROM CARTIER.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.521
THE BRACELET'S FROM...

15:21.521 --> 15:23.253
A SWAP MEET.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.197
HOLD IT.

15:27.197 --> 15:29.029
ARE YOU SAYING

15:29.029 --> 15:32.332
THAT THOSE DIAMONDS
ARE CUBIC ZIRCONIAS?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.704
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

15:34.704 --> 15:39.069
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
I GAVE YOU MYHEART,

15:39.069 --> 15:42.212
AND ALL YOU COULD GIVE ME
WAS FAKE JEWELRY?

15:42.212 --> 15:45.715
EDIE... (sighs) I'M SORRY.
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D FIND OUT.

15:47.677 --> 15:50.380
I JUST SPAT
ON ONE OF YOUR JELL-O CUBES.

15:50.380 --> 15:51.982
HAPPY HUNTING.

15:56.086 --> 15:58.058
(sighs)

15:59.089 --> 16:02.162
HEY, YOU. DO YOU KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S GONNA BE

16:02.162 --> 16:04.164
UNTIL CARLOS
GETS HIS SIGHT BACK?

16:04.164 --> 16:07.167
BECAUSE I HAVE A 2-WORD SENTENCE
I'D LIKE TO SAY TO HIM,

16:07.167 --> 16:10.140
AND THERE'S A HAND GESTURE
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.442
I DON'T KNOW. MR. SOLIS'
CONDITION IS VERY SERIOUS.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.104
SERIOUS? WHAT'S WRONG?

16:14.104 --> 16:15.545
WELL...

16:15.545 --> 16:18.548
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD REALLY
TALK TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT THIS.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.610
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HIS GIRLFRIEND KNOWS.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.184
YOU MEAN GABY?

16:24.184 --> 16:28.088
I'M SORRY.
I SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.493
OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S YOUR LUNCH.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.027
YEAH.
I'M SORT OF ON A BUDGET.

16:37.027 --> 16:39.529
NO, NO, NO. IF YOU'RE
GONNA GIVE QUALITY CARE,

16:39.529 --> 16:41.571
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME QUALITY FOOD.

16:41.571 --> 16:44.304
NOW I KNOW OF THIS
GREAT, LITTLE FRENCH BISTRO.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.737
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR LUNCH...

16:47.737 --> 16:50.410
AND CONVERSATION.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.583
"YOUR FATHER WAS MURDERED."

16:53.583 --> 16:55.715
WOW.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.348
I KNOW.

16:58.348 --> 17:01.391
ARE YOU SURE YOUR AUNT
KNEW WHAT SHE WAS WRITING?

17:01.391 --> 17:06.025
SHEWASPRETTY SICK.
 NO, SHE HAD IT TOGETHER,
EVEN ON THAT LAST DAY.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.028
I REMEMBER AUNT LILY REALLY
WANTED TO TELL ME SOMETHING,

17:09.028 --> 17:12.162
AND THEN MY MOM JUST CAME IN
AND STOPPED HER.

17:12.162 --> 17:14.233
DOES YOUR MOM KNOW
YOU FOUND THIS?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.736
NO, AND I'M NOT
GONNA TELL HER EITHER.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.309
WHY GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE
TO LIE TO ME?

17:21.141 --> 17:23.143
THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING TO ADAM.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.116
I CAN TRUST HIM
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.078
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

17:28.078 --> 17:31.581
I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOUR MOM LIE
ABOUT YOUR DAD BEING MURDERED?

17:31.581 --> 17:33.523
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:35.125 --> 17:37.727
JULIE...

17:37.727 --> 17:40.130
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO KILLED HIM.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.072
HI, BABE.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.146
I'M ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S
GONNA MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.

17:56.146 --> 17:58.178
GREAT, BUT CLOSE
THE CURTAIN FIRST.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.350
LAST TIME, THE NURSE
ALMOST WALKED IN

18:00.350 --> 18:03.213
WHEN YOU WERE ABOUT TO--
 CARLOS!
I HAVE A PRIEST WITH ME.

18:03.213 --> 18:05.185
PRIEST?
WHAT, IS THERE SOMETHING

18:05.185 --> 18:07.187
THE DOCTORS
AREN'T TELLING ME?

18:07.187 --> 18:10.190
NO, NO, NO.
I WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE,

18:10.190 --> 18:12.462
BUT WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!
(giggles)

18:14.864 --> 18:17.227
FATHER, HIT IT.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.569
DEARLY BELOVED,
WE ARE GATHERED HERE

18:19.569 --> 18:21.601
IN THE PRESENCE OF--
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.803
GABY, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

18:23.803 --> 18:26.876
I DON'T KNOW. JUST AFTER
EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

18:26.876 --> 18:29.239
THERE'S NOTHING
IN OUR WAY NOW.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.241
WE CAN FINALLY BE TOGETHER.

18:31.241 --> 18:34.614
AND I REALLY NEED THAT.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.547
I NEED A HAPPY ENDING,
CARLOS.

18:37.547 --> 18:41.221
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

18:44.294 --> 18:45.795
OKAY.

18:45.795 --> 18:48.298
(chuckles)

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
HOLY MATRIMONY.
BRING IT ON.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.302
GABY,
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,

18:52.302 --> 18:55.205
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO TELL YOU...

18:55.205 --> 18:57.407
IN PRIVATE.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.313
(men speaking indistinctly
in distance)

19:03.313 --> 19:05.345
OKAY, HE'S GONE.
WHAT'S UP?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.817
LOOK, I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU

19:07.817 --> 19:09.819
ABOUT THE EXTENT
OF MY INJURY.

19:09.819 --> 19:12.222
OKAY.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.454
THE DOCTOR SAYS...

19:14.454 --> 19:17.227
I MIGHT NOT
GET MY SIGHT BACK.

19:17.227 --> 19:18.728
(gasps)

19:18.728 --> 19:20.930
FOR THREE MONTHS.
FOUR, TOPS.

19:20.930 --> 19:25.235
I-I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU CAN HANDLE THAT.

19:25.235 --> 19:26.866
WOW.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.299
THAT'S...
A REALLY LONG TIME.

19:34.244 --> 19:36.946
BUT FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
RIGHT?

19:36.946 --> 19:39.379
RIGHT.

19:41.311 --> 19:42.482
OKAY, PADRE.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.287
WE'RE READY.
LET'S TAKE IT FROM THE TOP.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.290
DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE GATHERED
HERE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD

19:50.290 --> 19:52.292
TO JOIN THIS MAN
AND THIS WOMAN

19:52.292 --> 19:54.864
IN THE HOLY SACRAMENT
OF MATRIMONY.

19:56.526 --> 19:58.668
(bottles clink)

19:58.668 --> 20:01.671
YOU'RE OUT OF MILK.
YOU WANT ME TO PICK SOME UP?

20:01.671 --> 20:03.733
(mouth full) NO, THAT'S OKAY.
IT CAN WAIT.

20:03.733 --> 20:06.236
I DON'T MIND. I COULD USE
A LITTLE AIR ANYWAY.

20:06.236 --> 20:07.477
MM.

20:07.477 --> 20:08.878
(door opens)

20:08.878 --> 20:11.311
HMM.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.442
(door shuts)

20:12.442 --> 20:13.883
MM.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.820
(both speaking indistinctly)

20:20.820 --> 20:23.753
(gasps and spits)

20:23.753 --> 20:27.427
TIM! WHERE'S THAT MILK?

20:27.427 --> 20:29.559
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T WANT ANY. UH...

20:29.559 --> 20:31.261
I'M HAVING A BABY.

20:31.261 --> 20:33.833
I CAN'T GIVE BIRTH
WITH BRITTLE BONES. GO!

20:36.566 --> 20:38.738
BYE!

20:41.611 --> 20:43.473
(drilling in distance)

20:43.473 --> 20:46.846
HEY, CHURCH BUDDY.
LOOK WHAT I GOT.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.248
WOW, YOU BOUGHT A BIBLE.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.281
YEAH, AND I'M BREAKING HER IN
TONIGHT.

20:51.281 --> 20:54.484
(sniffs) NOTHING LIKE
THAT NEW BIBLE SMELL.

20:54.484 --> 20:56.356
OH, SO YOU'RE...
(chuckles nervously)

20:56.356 --> 20:59.429
COMING TO BIBLE STUDY.
 YEAH, AND I HOPE
THE REVEREND'S READY,

20:59.429 --> 21:02.692
'CAUSE I GOT ABOUT
A ZILLION QUESTIONS FOR HIM.

21:02.692 --> 21:04.263
(sighs) LYNETTE, I-I REALIZE

21:04.263 --> 21:06.766
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE
WITH CHURCHES,

21:06.766 --> 21:08.768
SO THIS REALLY
ISN'T YOUR FAULT.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.270
WHAT ISN'T MY FAULT?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.574
WELL, LAST SUNDAY, WHEN YOU
KEPT RAISING YOUR HAND...

21:14.574 --> 21:16.576
WE DON'T REALLY DO THAT.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.578
THE CHURCH ISN'T
A PLACE FOR QUESTIONS.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.510
IT'S A PLACE FOR ANSWERS.

21:20.510 --> 21:23.453
YEAH, BUT HOW DO YOU
GET THE ANSWERS

21:23.453 --> 21:25.415
IF YOU DON'T ASK
THE QUESTIONS?

21:25.415 --> 21:28.418
WELL, TYPICALLY, WE SIT THERE
AND LET THE PREACHER PREACH,

21:28.418 --> 21:30.420
AND EVENTUALLY,
OUR QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED,

21:30.420 --> 21:32.622
AND NO ONE IS HUMILIATED.

21:32.622 --> 21:36.326
I'M SORRY.
DID I EMBARRASS YOU ON SUNDAY?

21:36.326 --> 21:38.328
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT IN OUR CHURCH,

21:38.328 --> 21:40.530
PEOPLE DON'T TALK BACK
TO THE MINISTER.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.532
WELL, WHAT IF INEEDTO?

21:42.532 --> 21:45.475
WHAT IF THAT'S THE KIND
OF CHURCH I'M LOOKING FOR?

21:45.475 --> 21:47.537
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS.

21:47.537 --> 21:51.010
I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY ENJOY
TALKING BACK TO THE PULPIT,

21:51.010 --> 21:52.512
WHY DON'T YOU TRY

21:52.512 --> 21:54.714
THAT GOSPEL CHURCH
BY THE AIRPORT?

21:56.846 --> 21:59.088
OKAY.

21:59.088 --> 22:01.451
OR, UH, THE UNITARIANS.
 (door opens)

22:01.451 --> 22:04.394
FROM WHAT I HEAR, THOSE FOLKS
ARE "ANYTHING GOES."

22:04.394 --> 22:05.895
(door shuts)

22:16.966 --> 22:18.368
(beep)

22:18.368 --> 22:19.709
Hey, Adam. It's Dylan.

22:19.709 --> 22:22.842
I waited at your hotel all day,
but you never came back.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.845
You have to call me. I found
this note that Aunt Lily wrote.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.648
Mom threw it in the fireplace,
but I fished it out,

22:28.648 --> 22:30.650
and I have to talk to you.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.653
Call me on my cell,
not at home, 'cause I--

22:33.653 --> 22:35.385
(beep)

22:35.385 --> 22:38.558
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
I CAN HEAR IT IN HER VOICE.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.931
BUT SHE'S GOT THE NOTE.
 MAYBE A FEW BURNT PIECES.

22:41.931 --> 22:44.394
TRUST ME,
ALL SHE'S GOT ARE QUESTIONS.

22:44.394 --> 22:47.497
WELL, I COULD, UM,
REFUSE TO SEE HER.

22:47.497 --> 22:51.541
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT
WON'T AROUSE HER SUSPICION.

22:51.541 --> 22:55.675
NO. YOU ARE GOING TO ASK HER
TO COME HERE,

22:55.675 --> 22:58.377
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO FIND OUT

22:58.377 --> 23:00.480
EXACTLY WHAT SHE KNOWS
AND WHAT SHE DOESN'T.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.612
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
MAYBE IT WOULD BE EASIER

23:02.612 --> 23:04.854
JUST TO FINALLY
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

23:04.854 --> 23:07.857
AND YOU WOULD JUST WAVE GOOD-BYE
AS THEY CART ME OFF TO JAIL?

23:07.857 --> 23:10.089
SHE WOULDN'T
CALL THE POLICE.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.992
SERIOUSLY, I THINK YOU TWO
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.496
(laughs) THEN YOU HAVE NOT
BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.498
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO GET HOME,

23:18.498 --> 23:22.772
THEN CALL HER AND SET UP
A TIME FOR YOU TWO TO MEET.
 OKAY.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.006
YOU KNOW...

23:28.838 --> 23:31.781
WHEN YOU CALLED ME TONIGHT,

23:31.781 --> 23:34.484
I WAS HALF HOPING
YOU MISSED ME.

23:34.484 --> 23:37.116
REALLY?

23:39.519 --> 23:42.091
I MISSYOU.

23:43.853 --> 23:46.556
I'M SO TERRIBLY LONELY.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.429
YOU KNOW I DON'T DO WELL
ON MY OWN.

23:53.763 --> 23:56.435
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
WE COULD...

23:56.435 --> 23:59.438
GET PAST THIS,
AND YOU COULD COME BACK HOME?

24:02.772 --> 24:05.174
I WILL TALK TO DYLAN.

24:05.174 --> 24:09.749
I WILL PROVIDE YOU
ONE LAST ALIBI.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.921
AFTER THAT, I'M DONE.

24:11.921 --> 24:14.624
(chuckles)

24:31.100 --> 24:33.102
(calculator whirs)

24:33.102 --> 24:36.646
ARE YOU GUYS OUTTA HERE?
 YES,
I'M GONNA RUN SOME ERRANDS,

24:36.646 --> 24:38.648
AND ORSON'S GONNA
TAKE BENJAMIN TO THE PARK.

24:38.648 --> 24:40.950
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT
I MIGHT TAKE HIM TO THE MUSEUM.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.182
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
BENJAMIN LOVES MATISSE.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.685
BENJAMIN DOESN'T LOVE MATISSE.
HE LOVES PURPLE.
 OH.

24:45.685 --> 24:49.519
PLEASE STOP TRYING TO TURN
OUR SON INTO AN INTELLECTUAL.
 MM.

24:49.519 --> 24:52.662
(door opens and shuts)

24:52.662 --> 24:55.164
IF YOU SAW HOW
HER FIRST TWO TURNED OUT,

24:55.164 --> 24:57.166
YOU'D UNDERSTAND
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

24:57.166 --> 24:59.669
FOR ME TO FIGHT
THE VAN DE KAMP D.N.A.

25:01.771 --> 25:05.635
(door opens and shuts)

25:09.508 --> 25:12.511
(beeping)

25:16.786 --> 25:18.287
HEY, IT'S TIM.

25:18.287 --> 25:21.190
IT WAS GREAT SEEING YOU
THE OTHER DAY.

25:21.190 --> 25:24.624
YEAH, I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU EITHER.

25:24.624 --> 25:29.098
SO LISTEN, UM, I'VE GOT
THE WHOLE PLACE TO MYSELF.

25:29.098 --> 25:30.830
YOU WANNA COME OVER?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.063
HEY, GABY.

25:34.063 --> 25:37.536
I HEARD YOU AND CARLOS
GOT MARRIED YESTERDAY.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.609
GUESS THIS MEANS YOU WIN.

25:39.609 --> 25:42.271
OH, EDIE,
IT WASN'T A COMPETITION,

25:42.271 --> 25:44.614
BUT, YEAH, I GUESS I DID.

25:44.614 --> 25:46.876
YEAH, BUT I THINK
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST.

25:46.876 --> 25:49.579
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
I COULD HAVE NEVER BEEN

25:49.579 --> 25:51.981
THE HERO
THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE.

25:51.981 --> 25:54.553
HERO? WHY AM I A HERO?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.056
COMMITTING YOUR LIFE
TO A MAN WHO'S BLIND?

25:57.056 --> 26:00.059
MY GOD, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM--

26:00.059 --> 26:02.561
DRESS HIM, SHAVE HIM,
LEAD HIM TO THE BATHROOM,

26:02.561 --> 26:05.595
PRAY THAT HIS AIM
IS HALFWAY DECENT.
 IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

26:05.595 --> 26:08.668
CARLOS IS GONNA GET HIS SIGHT
BACK IN THREE MONTHS.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.999
FOUR, TOPS.

26:09.999 --> 26:14.744
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU?
YOU POOR, GULLIBLE FOOL.

26:14.744 --> 26:17.677
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:17.677 --> 26:19.979
I HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOU THIS,

26:19.979 --> 26:21.981
BUT I TALKED TO THE NURSE,

26:21.981 --> 26:23.983
AND SHE SAID
THAT HIS CONDITION IS...

26:23.983 --> 26:25.885
OH, WHAT'S THE WORD?
UM...

26:25.885 --> 26:27.186
OH, YEAH.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.688
PERMANENT.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.660
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.662
CALL THE DOCTOR
IF YOU'D LIKE.

26:32.662 --> 26:34.864
AND APPARENTLY, HE WAS
BEGGING CARLOS TO TELL YOU.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.868
NO. NO, NO, NO.
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE.

26:38.868 --> 26:40.870
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

26:40.870 --> 26:42.872
WOMEN WHO ARE MARRIED
TO BLIND GUYS

26:42.872 --> 26:46.736
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT MAKEUP OR GETTING FAT.

26:46.736 --> 26:51.380
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS?

26:51.380 --> 26:54.613
OKAY,
I'M CALLING DR. DUNLAP.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.047
YOU DO THAT.
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

26:58.047 --> 27:00.389
CONGRATS ON YOUR BIG WIN.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.027
SO HOW'S YOUR
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY GOING?

27:08.027 --> 27:10.700
DO THEY STILL HAVE YOU
SCRUBBING POTS IN THE KITCHEN?

27:10.700 --> 27:13.703
NO, NO. ONCE THEY FOUND OUT
I'M A PROFESSIONAL PLUMBER,

27:13.703 --> 27:16.666
I GOT PROMOTED
TO SCRUBBING TOILETS.
 MM, WELL,
MAYBE YOU WON'T MIND

27:16.666 --> 27:19.669
DOING A LITTLE SCRUBBING
WHEN YOU COME HOME NEXT WEEK.
 ACTUALLY, THE DOCTORS
KINDA FROWN ON THAT.

27:19.669 --> 27:22.672
THEY ENCOURAGE US TO LEAVE
THAT SORT OF STUFF BEHIND.

27:22.672 --> 27:24.674
WELL, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE TOILETS.

27:24.674 --> 27:26.676
I MEAN,
IT COULD BE SINKS, BATHTUBS.

27:26.676 --> 27:28.678
YOU'RE MAKING ME
WANNA USE, SUSAN.

27:28.678 --> 27:30.319
THIS JUNKIE THING'S
AWESOME.

27:30.319 --> 27:33.382
OH, I FORGOT. UH, TIM HAS
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TAXES.

27:33.382 --> 27:36.655
DO YOU MIND TALKING TO HIM?
 NO, I DON'T MIND.
THOUGH I CAN'T BELIEVE

27:36.655 --> 27:41.160
HE'D HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH
YOUR COOKIE TIN FILING SYSTEM.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.661
(ring)

27:42.661 --> 27:44.163
(beep)

27:44.163 --> 27:47.136
(panting) HELLO?
 HEY, UH, TIM,
I'VE GOT MIKE HERE.

27:47.136 --> 27:49.138
DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM?

27:49.138 --> 27:52.101
UH, CAN I DO THAT LATER?
I'M SORT OF TAKING A NAP.

27:52.101 --> 27:53.903
(woman giggling)

27:53.903 --> 27:57.676
(whispers) WHAT WAS THAT?
IS SOMEONE THERE?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.880
WHAT? NO. NO. UNH-UNH.
NO--NO ONE'S HERE.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.883
REALLY?
'CAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE A GIRL.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.985
NO, UH,
IT--IT WAS JUST THE TV.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.987
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TAKING A NAP.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.790
UH, THE TV HELPS ME SLEEP.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.322
UH, TELL MIKE
I'LL CALL HIM LATER.

28:15.765 --> 28:18.227
I'VE GOTTA GO.

28:18.227 --> 28:20.830
WHAT? WHAT?
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.973
I KNOW, BUT THIS VISIT WAS
REALLY MORE FOR JULIE.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.475
FOR ME?
 YEAH, YOU'RE GOING
TO COLLEGE SOON,

28:26.475 --> 28:29.779
AND I WANT HIM TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DRUGS.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.881
SCARE HER STRAIGHT, MIKE.

28:31.881 --> 28:34.283
(door shuts)

28:34.283 --> 28:36.085
(Carlos)
HONEY, YOU DOWN HERE?

28:36.085 --> 28:38.087
YES, SWEETHEART.

28:38.087 --> 28:40.890
I'M IN THE KITCHEN
MAKING DINNER.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.792
MMM. SMELLS GOOD.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.124
IT'S A NEW RECIPE
FOR BEEF STEW.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.426
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.999
WHY DON'T
WE LET THAT SIMMER?

28:49.999 --> 28:52.932
DURING MY NAP, I HAD
THE FILTHIEST LITTLE DREAM.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.805
I WAS KINDA HOPING
MAYBE WE COULD...

28:55.805 --> 28:57.736
SKIP STRAIGHT TO DESSERT?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.008
YEAH.

28:59.008 --> 29:00.509
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

29:00.509 --> 29:04.413
I'D SAY
I'M ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU.

29:04.413 --> 29:07.316
I HAVE ALREADY SLIPPED
INTO MY PINK LACE TEDDY,

29:07.316 --> 29:10.349
AND I'M WEARING THOSE
WHORE-Y PUMPS THAT YOU LOVE.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.052
OOH, I LIKE THAT IMAGE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

29:13.052 --> 29:16.826
I'M RIGHT HERE, BABE.

29:16.826 --> 29:17.987
(bang)

29:17.987 --> 29:19.758
OW! (groaning)

29:19.758 --> 29:23.762
OH, I'M SORRY.
I FORGOT THAT WAS OPEN.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.465
LET'S DO IT OVER HERE,
ON THE TABLE.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.467
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

29:28.467 --> 29:31.070
CAN'T.
MY LEGS ARE IN THE AIR.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.803
JUST FOLLOW
THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.

29:33.803 --> 29:35.104
THERE YOU GO.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.246
I'M OVER HERE, SWEETIE.

29:37.246 --> 29:39.979
(thud)
 WHOA! UHH! SON OF A BITCH!

29:39.979 --> 29:42.952
OOH, I MEANT TO MOVE THAT.

29:42.952 --> 29:47.116
HANG ON. LET ME JUST PULL
MY PANTIES UP SO I CAN HELP YOU.

29:47.116 --> 29:48.457
(groans)

29:48.457 --> 29:50.860
(grunts) OKAY. HERE.

29:50.860 --> 29:53.262
LET'S GO DO IT OVER HERE.

29:53.262 --> 29:54.793
(bang)

29:54.793 --> 29:57.827
AAH! DAMN IT!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!

29:57.827 --> 29:59.829
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

29:59.829 --> 30:01.831
"IN THREE MONTHS.
FOUR, TOPS."

30:01.831 --> 30:04.433
UH-OH.

30:04.433 --> 30:06.836
"UH-OH" IS RIGHT,
YOU BLIND BASTARD!

30:06.836 --> 30:11.841
OW! ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED!
 OH, NO, NO. I THINK
IT WAS A FANTASTIC PLAN.

30:11.841 --> 30:15.114
I MEAN, THERE'S NOWAY
 I EVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT

30:15.114 --> 30:17.987
THAT I WAS MARRIED
TO A PERMANENTLY BLIND GUY!

30:17.987 --> 30:19.088
OW!

30:19.088 --> 30:22.521
ALL RIGHT, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT BY THE TIME YOU DID,

30:22.521 --> 30:24.523
YOU'D BE USED TO THE IDEA,

30:24.523 --> 30:26.956
AND MAYBE THEN
YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE ME.

30:26.956 --> 30:29.128
LEAVE YOU?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.830
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT SHALLOW?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.432
(mutters)

30:33.432 --> 30:37.937
GABY,
I'M POOR AND I'M BLIND,

30:37.937 --> 30:39.238
AND LET'S FACE IT.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.271
THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THAT
THAT ISYOURTYPE.

30:42.271 --> 30:44.443
WOW. THANKS
FOR THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

30:46.115 --> 30:49.178
Y-YES, THE TRUTH
WOULD HAVE FREAKED ME OUT,

30:49.178 --> 30:52.421
BUT I WOULD HAVE
COME AROUND.

30:52.421 --> 30:55.054
IF YOU HAD JUST
HAD A LITTLE FAITH IN ME,

30:55.054 --> 30:58.057
I COULD HAVE PROVEN TO YOU
THAT I WAS UP FOR THE CHALLENGE,

30:58.057 --> 31:01.030
BUT YOU ROBBED ME
OF THAT CHANCE.
 I'M SORRY.

31:01.030 --> 31:02.431
GOOD.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.966
TO AVOID FUTURE CONFUSION,
I LOVE YOU,

31:06.966 --> 31:09.969
AND I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.405
GABY, THIS IS
NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

31:16.405 --> 31:19.278
I KNOW,

31:19.278 --> 31:21.911
BUT LIKE I SAID,

31:21.911 --> 31:23.913
"FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE."

31:28.487 --> 31:31.991
THINK YOU CAN FORGIVE ME?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.393
I'LL WORK ON IT.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.395
WHILE YOU'RE WORKING ON IT,

31:36.395 --> 31:38.928
MIND IF I DIG
INTO SOME OF THAT STEW?

31:43.602 --> 31:45.204
SURE.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.905
(car approaches, brakes squeal)

31:46.905 --> 31:49.208
(car door opens and shuts)

31:54.143 --> 31:57.916
UGH! GET OFF THAT POOR GIRL
RIGHT NOW!

31:59.949 --> 32:01.050
(gasps)

32:02.992 --> 32:04.994
I FINISHED YOUR TAXES.

32:04.994 --> 32:07.026
(whimpers)

32:13.002 --> 32:16.705
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?
 SUSAN, I'MSOSORRY.

32:16.705 --> 32:18.037
NO, KATHERINE,

32:18.037 --> 32:20.239
I KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
GOING THROUGH EMOTIONALLY,

32:20.239 --> 32:22.241
SO YOU
DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

32:22.241 --> 32:25.244
AND BY THE WAY,
YOUR BOOB IS OUT.
 OH. (laughs nervously)

32:25.244 --> 32:27.416
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND--
 I KNOW. I KNOW.

32:27.416 --> 32:30.279
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU DO?

32:30.279 --> 32:32.281
YOU WORM YOUR WAY
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD

32:32.281 --> 32:34.223
WITH THE PROMISE
OF FREE TAX PREPARATION,

32:34.223 --> 32:36.685
AND THEN YOU JUMP ON THE NEAREST
MIDDLE-AGED DIVORCéE?
 HEY!

32:36.685 --> 32:39.088
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
SHE CAME OVER FOR SOME DRINKS,

32:39.088 --> 32:41.360
AND WE GOT TO TALKING
AND STARTED REMINISCING,

32:41.360 --> 32:43.362
AND ALL THESE OLD FEELINGS
CAME RUSHING BACK.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.595
OH, NICE TRY, TIMMY. LIKE I'M
REALLY GOING TO BELIEVE THAT.

32:46.595 --> 32:49.098
SHAME ON YOU. JUST... SHAME!

32:53.372 --> 32:55.374
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"OLD FEELINGS"?

32:58.047 --> 33:00.549
DO WE REALLY NEED
TO GET INTO THIS?

33:00.549 --> 33:03.012
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO REMINISCE ABOUT?

33:03.012 --> 33:05.314
HE WAS HERE FOR A WEEK
WHEN HE WAS 16.

33:05.314 --> 33:07.986
WHAT COULD YOU TWO
HAVE EVEN...

33:07.986 --> 33:09.988
OH, MY GOD,
YOU SLEPT TOGETHER.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.662
OKAY, BEFORE YOU GET
SOME SORDID IMAGE IN YOUR HEAD--
 SHE TOOK MY VIRGINITY.

33:13.662 --> 33:17.426
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY IT
LIKE THAT?
 THAT'S HOW I SAID IT TO
EVERY SINGLE GUY AT BAND CAMP.

33:17.426 --> 33:19.528
SHAME ONYOU!

33:19.528 --> 33:21.670
HIS MOTHER TRUSTED ME
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

33:21.670 --> 33:23.202
AND YOU SWOOP IN

33:23.202 --> 33:25.634
LIKE SOME SWOOPING,
SEX-CRAVED--

33:25.634 --> 33:28.107
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, TIM!
PULL UP THE BLANKET!

33:28.107 --> 33:30.709
YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ON KATHERINE.
I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.712
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.
I'M DONE WITH BOTH OF YOU.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.215
IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME,
I'LL BE AT THE MALL...

33:36.215 --> 33:39.088
BUYING SHEETS.

33:39.088 --> 33:41.690
(Reverend Sykes) GOOD MORNING.
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER SERVICE.

33:41.690 --> 33:43.692
OH! GOOD MORNING, REVEREND.
 (laughs)

33:43.692 --> 33:46.125
I BROUGHT YOUR FAVORITE--
BLUEBERRY SCONES.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.127
THANK YOU, BREE.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.429
BY THE WAY,
I'M SORRY I'VE TAKEN SO LONG

33:50.429 --> 33:52.701
TO MAKE A DECISION
ABOUT THE LADIES' AUXILIARY.

33:52.701 --> 33:55.504
OH, IS THAT HAPPENING NOW?
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT.

33:55.504 --> 33:57.506
SO IS YOUR, UH,
DELIGHTFUL NEIGHBOR COMING?

33:57.506 --> 33:59.508
THE ONE
WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS?

33:59.508 --> 34:01.770
DELIGHTFUL? (chuckles nervously)
I THOUGHT SHE ANNOYED YOU.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.672
NO, I FOUND HER REFRESHING.

34:03.672 --> 34:06.175
IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY.

34:06.175 --> 34:08.177
CHURCH IS NOT A PLACE
FOR ANSWERS.

34:08.177 --> 34:10.349
IT'S A PLACE FOR QUESTIONS.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.150
YOU DON'T SAY THAT.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.224
I'VE--I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
SAY THAT, NOT ONCE.
 YES, WELL, ANYWAY,

34:15.224 --> 34:17.525
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR TAKING THE INITIATIVE.

34:17.525 --> 34:20.429
NEW MEMBERS ARE CRUCIAL
TO THE HEALTH OF THIS CHURCH.

34:20.429 --> 34:23.592
I WON'T FORGET
YOU BROUGHT THEM... OR THESE.

34:23.592 --> 34:25.094
THANK YOU, REVEREND,

34:25.094 --> 34:28.797
AND I'M--I'M SURE THE SCAVOS
WILL BE HERE SOON.

34:28.797 --> 34:31.170
WHY DID YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

34:31.170 --> 34:33.472
YOU KNOW VERY WELL THEY WENT
TO CATHOLIC CHURCH.

34:33.472 --> 34:37.406
(whispers) WHICH IS JUST DOWN
THE STREET. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

34:43.252 --> 34:45.384
PSST!

34:45.384 --> 34:48.187
(whispers) NOT YOU.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.858
LYNETTE.

34:49.858 --> 34:52.391
(whispers)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:52.391 --> 34:54.393
I WAS GONNA
ASK THE SAME OF YOU.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.395
WHY ARE YOU
IN A CATHOLIC CHURCH?

34:56.395 --> 34:58.327
BECAUSE WE'RE CATHOLIC.
 OH, PLEASE.

34:58.327 --> 35:00.829
MOWING YOUR LAWN
IN A NOTRE DAME SWEATSHIRT

35:00.829 --> 35:02.331
DOESN'T MAKE YOU CATHOLIC.

35:02.331 --> 35:05.804
YOU'RE PRESBYTERIAN NOW.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

35:05.804 --> 35:09.838
WEREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO SAID
I SHOULD EXPLOREOTHERCHURCHES?

35:09.838 --> 35:11.810
I MEANT SAMPLE,
LIKE A BUFFET.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.812
YOU TAKE A LITTLE PLATE
OF EVERYTHING,

35:13.812 --> 35:15.814
AND THEN YOU SIT DOWN
FOR THE MAIN COURSE,

35:15.814 --> 35:17.546
WHICH IS ACROSS THE STREET...

35:17.546 --> 35:19.548
(whispers)
AT THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.

35:19.548 --> 35:22.251
NO. I JUST PUT 10 BUCKS
IN THE COLLECTION PLATE,

35:22.251 --> 35:25.254
AND I'M GONNA
GET MY MONEY'S WORTH.
 IS THERE A PROBLEM?

35:25.254 --> 35:29.298
(normal voice) NO, NO PROBLEM.
JUST TALKING TO MY FRIEND.
 SHE'S TRYING TO POACH HER.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.129
I AM NOT!

35:32.401 --> 35:34.403
MY FRIEND'S
JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.405
SHE FORGOT
THAT SHE'S PRESBYTERIAN

35:36.405 --> 35:38.437
AND WANDERED
INTO THE WRONG CHURCH.
 I'M NOT PRESBYTERIAN.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.269
I'M A FREE AGENT.

35:40.269 --> 35:43.172
AND IF YOU'RE OPEN TO
A LITTLE Q AND A, YOU'VE GOT ME.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.143
(sighs)

35:45.143 --> 35:46.475
LYNETTE, PLEASE.

35:46.475 --> 35:51.250
CAN'T WE JUST GO OUTSIDE
AND TALK FOR A MOMENT?

35:53.322 --> 35:54.853
OKAY, WHAT GIVES?

35:54.853 --> 35:57.356
WELL, I WAS AT THE SERVICE
THIS MORNING,

35:57.356 --> 36:00.559
AND IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU.
 BREE...

36:00.559 --> 36:04.893
AND I AM... UP FOR THE HEAD
OF THE LADIES' AUXILIARY,

36:04.893 --> 36:06.895
AND REVEREND SYKES
WAS SO IMPRESSED

36:06.895 --> 36:09.898
THAT I BROUGHT A NEW FAMILY
INTO CHURCH,SO...(sighs)

36:09.898 --> 36:11.900
IF YOU DON'T COME BACK,
THEN--

36:11.900 --> 36:15.704
OH, THEN YOU WON'T GET
WHAT YOU WANT?
 WELL, YES.

36:15.704 --> 36:17.206
WELL, FORGET IT.

36:17.206 --> 36:19.708
LET SOMEONE ELSE HELP YOU
WITH YOUR POWER GRAB.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.179
LYNETTE!

36:21.179 --> 36:24.283
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CAME TO ME.
 YOUSOUGHTMEOUT.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.285
YES, AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

36:26.285 --> 36:28.287
BECAUSE
OUT OF ALL MY FRIENDS,

36:28.287 --> 36:30.289
YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO HAD REAL FAITH.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.591
YOU HAD AN ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH GOD.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.593
AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.365
LYNETTE--

36:36.365 --> 36:39.268
BECAUSE I HAVE HAD A ROUGH
FEW MONTHS. (laughs) OKAY?

36:39.268 --> 36:41.770
BUT I KNOW
YOU'VE HAD ROUGH TIMES, TOO,

36:41.770 --> 36:43.272
AND I ALWAYS ASSUMED

36:43.272 --> 36:46.235
THAT YOURFAITHHAD HELPED YOU
GET THROUGH THEM.

36:46.235 --> 36:48.737
I ENVIED YOU THAT,
TO BE HONEST.

36:48.737 --> 36:51.840
IT DID. ITDIDHELP ME.

36:53.282 --> 36:54.413
REALLY?

36:56.315 --> 36:58.247
OKAY. HOW?

37:00.519 --> 37:02.391
IT JUST DID.

37:02.391 --> 37:04.393
WELL,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD ANSWER.

37:04.393 --> 37:06.695
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH CANCER
AND A TORNADO,

37:06.695 --> 37:10.659
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I SURVIVED,
AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T.

37:10.659 --> 37:14.863
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
AND I NEED TO.

37:14.863 --> 37:16.865
LYNETTE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

37:16.865 --> 37:18.667
WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK?

37:21.009 --> 37:22.511
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

37:22.511 --> 37:25.414
YOU DON'T LIKE
ASKING QUESTIONS.

37:42.030 --> 37:43.992
HEY, LYNETTE.

37:43.992 --> 37:46.635
HI THERE. (chuckles)

37:46.635 --> 37:49.368
(chuckles nervously)
JUST... WANTED TO TELL YOU

37:49.368 --> 37:52.371
THAT I'M OUT OF THE RUNNING
FOR THE LADIES' AUXILIARY.

37:52.371 --> 37:56.044
I TOLD REVEREND SYKES TO, UH,
GIVE IT TO EDNA FLETCHER.

37:56.044 --> 37:58.547
SHE WAS IN THE PEACE CORPS,
YOU KNOW.

37:58.547 --> 38:01.450
HUH. THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.413
I SUPPOSE. I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT.

38:05.954 --> 38:08.787
AND ALSO TO... APOLOGIZE.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.320
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.423
YES, I DO. YOU WERE RIGHT.
FAITH SHOULDN'T BE BLIND.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.425
YOU DON'T THREATEN IT
BY ASKING QUESTIONS.

38:16.425 --> 38:19.428
YOU MAKE IT STRONGER,
AND I LOST SIGHT OF THAT.

38:19.428 --> 38:22.000
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.304
AND IT MEANT A LOT THAT YOU
CAME TOMEFOR GUIDANCE, AND...

38:26.304 --> 38:28.607
I'M SORRY
THAT I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU.

38:30.379 --> 38:34.312
I WANT YOU TO HAVE FAITH IN ME
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.617
WELL...

38:38.617 --> 38:42.491
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT ARE EASY TO BELIEVE IN.

38:45.394 --> 38:47.656
HOW'S CATHOLICISM GOING,
BY THE WAY?

38:47.656 --> 38:49.428
MEH.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.659
(laughs)

38:50.659 --> 38:53.502
WELL, IF YOU EVER WANNA
TRY US AGAIN...

38:53.502 --> 38:56.034
OH, WELL, I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE
WITH THE CATHOLICS.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.036
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO DON'T JUDGE ME

38:58.036 --> 39:00.409
FOR HAVING SO MANY KIDS.

39:00.409 --> 39:01.770
(both laugh)

39:03.942 --> 39:05.374
HEY.

39:05.374 --> 39:07.746
HEY.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.878
OKAY, SO I HAVE TO ASK.

39:09.878 --> 39:12.381
THIS THING THAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND KATHERINE

39:12.381 --> 39:14.122
12 YEARS AGO--

39:14.122 --> 39:16.124
WAS IT AN ONGOING AFFAIR?

39:16.124 --> 39:18.957
NO.
NO, IT WAS JUST THE ONE TIME,

39:18.957 --> 39:21.960
AND I THINK SHE FELT PRETTY
GUILTY ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.463
SHE TOLD ME
NOT TO COME AROUND ANYMORE.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.536
SO YOU DIDN'T GO BACK?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.470
IT'S WEIRD. I TRIED TO.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.443
(Tim) IT WAS THE LAST NIGHT
OF MY VISIT.

39:34.443 --> 39:36.745
I THOUGHT
IF I BROUGHT HER SOME FLOWERS,

39:36.745 --> 39:39.448
MAYBE I COULD
GET SOMETHING GOING, YOU KNOW?

39:39.448 --> 39:41.910
BUT WHEN I GOT UP
TO THE FRONT DOOR,

39:41.910 --> 39:44.152
I HEARD ALL THIS YELLING.
 (man) ...SAY GOOD NIGHT
TO MY DAUGHTER.

39:44.152 --> 39:46.154
(Katherine) SHE IS ASLEEP.
GET THE HELL OUT.
 I WENT AROUND TO THE WINDOW

39:46.154 --> 39:48.457
JUST TO GET A LOOK
AT WHAT WAS GOING ON...
 REMEMBER? SHE'S MY DAUGHTER!

39:48.457 --> 39:52.120
I'M HER FATHER!
 AND I COULD SEE SHE WAS HAVING
A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.162
I WAS ABOUT TO RUSH IN
AND HELP HER

39:54.162 --> 39:57.165
WHEN I SAW KATHERINE
PICK UP THIS CANDLESTICK

39:57.165 --> 39:58.967
AND JUST WAIL ON HIM.
 (thud)

39:58.967 --> 40:01.430
HE WENT DOWN PRETTY HARD.

40:01.430 --> 40:04.002
KATHERINE
WAS JUST STANDING OVER HIM

40:04.002 --> 40:06.675
WITH THIS LOOK IN HER EYE.

40:06.675 --> 40:11.980
IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME,
SO I GOT OUT OF THERE.

40:11.980 --> 40:13.982
I LEFT THE NEXT MORNING

40:13.982 --> 40:16.585
AND NEVER TALKED
TO KATHERINE AGAIN.

40:18.487 --> 40:22.451
SO... THIS MAN--
WHO DO YOU THINK IT WAS?

40:22.451 --> 40:23.792
DON'T KNOW.

40:23.792 --> 40:27.496
I SORT OF GOT THE IMPRESSION
HE WAS HER EX-HUSBAND.

40:27.496 --> 40:29.498
DOES SHE EVER TALK
ABOUT HIM?

40:29.498 --> 40:30.759
NOT REALLY.

40:30.759 --> 40:33.502
MM. HAVE YOU SEEN HIM LATELY?

40:35.003 --> 40:37.435
NO.

40:41.710 --> 40:45.013
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER,
I'VE HAD THIS FEELING

40:45.013 --> 40:47.846
THAT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

40:47.846 --> 40:53.151
WEIRD DREAMS THAT DON'T
SEEM LIKE DREAMS AT ALL.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.153
PEOPLE TELLING ME
I FORGOT THINGS

40:55.153 --> 40:58.156
THAT IKNOW
 I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.091
AND NOW FINALLY,

41:03.091 --> 41:07.636
I FIND A SENTENCE
ON A PIECE OF PAPER...

41:07.636 --> 41:10.499
(sniffles) THAT COULD
EXPLAIN ALL OF IT

41:10.499 --> 41:13.001
AND PROVE
THAT I AM NOT CRAZY.

41:15.203 --> 41:17.576
AND THE BEST
THAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH

41:17.576 --> 41:20.549
IS THAT AUNT LILY
WAS LOSING IT

41:20.549 --> 41:22.851
AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS WRITING?

41:27.516 --> 41:29.487
I NEED THE TRUTH, ADAM.

41:31.059 --> 41:33.191
PLEASE.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.493
PLEASE.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.497
THE TRUTH, DYLAN...

41:39.497 --> 41:40.899
IS THAT...

41:43.271 --> 41:46.274
YOUR MOTHER
DIDN'T KILL YOUR FATHER.

41:46.274 --> 41:48.236
(sighs)

41:48.236 --> 41:51.580
AND SHE LOVES YOU
MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW.

41:53.582 --> 41:56.585
(crying)

42:02.020 --> 42:04.522
(Mary Alice)
FAITH IS A BELIEF IN SOMETHING

42:04.522 --> 42:08.557
THAT CANNOT BE PROVEN.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.599
SO WE TRUST IN THE WORDS

42:10.599 --> 42:13.602
OF THE ONLY FATHER
WE'VE EVER KNOWN.

42:15.864 --> 42:20.669
WE BELIEVE THE PROMISES OF
THE WOMAN WHO SHARES OUR BED.

42:23.712 --> 42:26.715
WE RELY ON THE EXAMPLE
OF DEAR FRIENDS

42:26.715 --> 42:30.218
WHO HELP US
TO BE BETTER PEOPLE.

42:32.881 --> 42:38.727
YES, WE ALL WANT TO BELIEVE
IN THOSE WE ARE CLOSEST TO,

42:38.727 --> 42:40.959
BUT WHERE THERE IS DOUBT,

42:40.959 --> 42:45.093
OUR FAITH BEGINS TO VANISH...

42:45.093 --> 42:48.096
AND FEAR RUSHES IN
TO TAKE ITS PLACE.
