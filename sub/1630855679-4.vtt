01:21.247 --> 01:23.374
So this pirate butler,
he killed your friend's lawyer

01:23.458 --> 01:25.043
and he's threatening to kill your friend?

01:25.126 --> 01:26.753
My best friend, Kaya.
He's up to something.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.421
Who pretends to be a butler anyway?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.882
You're not actually buying any of this,
are you?

01:30.965 --> 01:35.136
Well, I'm telling the truth.
Klahadore is a pirate. No, sorry. Kuro.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.765
-His name is Captain Kuro.
-Ha! Now I know you're lying.

01:38.848 --> 01:42.727
-Captain Kuro of the Black Cat Pirates?
-Yes. Long claws, tiny glasses.

01:42.811 --> 01:47.649
Impossible. My father,
Axe-Hand Morgan, killed him years ago.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.486
Any Marine worth their salt knows that.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.741
No closer to finding Straw Hat
than we were hours ago.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.034
Straw Hat? You mean Luffy?

01:58.743 --> 01:59.953
Wait. You know Luffy?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.830
My other, other best friend.
He's in trouble.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.666
-Luffy's at the place?
-[Usopp] Yes! Aren't you listening to me?

02:04.749 --> 02:07.293
Someone has to stop Kuro.
I can't do it by myself.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.504
It's okay. We're here to help.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.465
Isn't that right?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.050
Well, yes.

02:14.759 --> 02:15.760

[Kuro] What is he doing here?

03:37.425 --> 03:38.760
What's wrong with him?

03:38.843 --> 03:41.846
Little guy couldn't get enough
of my latest recipe.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.726
I was chasing that perfect balance
between bitter and savory.

03:48.895 --> 03:53.024
Just wish I could've asked him
how it tasted.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.693
-It tasted like poison, idiot.
-[Buchi] Not while I'm the cook.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.904
[Sham] You're not a cook.
I'm not a maid. We're pirates.

Sell yourself short, Sham,
but leave my cooking out of--

04:00.573 --> 04:01.741
[Kuro] Enough!

04:02.367 --> 04:05.828
I can't hear myself think
over your inbred nonsense!

04:06.788 --> 04:10.041
Now, how much of the soup did he eat?

04:10.625 --> 04:11.584
Uh…

04:17.048 --> 04:18.591
All of it.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.679
[Kuro] How fortuitous.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.102
Go ahead and toss him in the well
with the green-haired oaf.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.145
[Buchi] Aye aye, Captain.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.860

Whatever could be the matter
at this time of night?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.706
Sorry to bother you at such a late hour,

05:31.789 --> 05:33.750
but we heard reports
of pirates in the area.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.586
What? What are you talking about?
He is the pirate!

05:36.669 --> 05:39.881
He murdered Merry!
Arrest him. What are you waiting for?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.007
Oh dear.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.011
I'm so sorry
if Usopp here has wasted your time.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.888
You see, he's not well.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.558
The entire village
has tried their utmost to help, but

05:51.267 --> 05:54.479

[Usopp] Leave my mother out of this.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.865

06:06.366 --> 06:09.118
Do you mind if we have a look?
Just to be certain.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.495
Well…

06:11.954 --> 06:14.040
I'm not sure where he gets these ideas.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.043
A butler's gloves. Such an imagination.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.295
I guess some fruit gets so bruised,

it can't help
but to be rotten at the core. [chuckles]

06:24.175 --> 06:26.052
But, uh, I know what I saw.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.678
All right. That's enough.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.347
I thought we had a job to do.

06:30.431 --> 06:34.519
We're looking for a fugitive.
Goes by the name of Luffy.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.603
Luffy?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.898
Luffy, why, yes, I do know that name.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.608
Belongs to one of the lowly criminals

06:40.691 --> 06:42.485
Usopp has introduced
to the lady of the house.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.153
Horrible bunch. Drank the place dry.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.615
I have one of the staff members
keeping an eye on him now.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.461
Buchi, the Marines are here.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.506
They've come to collect
the drunken Straw Hat Pirate.

at once.

-What are we gonna do?

But what if the Straw Hat talks?

07:12.890 --> 07:13.724

07:14.308 --> 07:17.103
He drank enough of that soup
to kill a sea beast.

[Usopp] You've got it all wrong.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.457
Luffy is a pirate, sure,
but not like Kuro.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.836
It's… it's confusing, but please.
Kaya. Kaya's in danger!

07:41.919 --> 07:45.965
Sorry, Usopp. You don't have any proof.
There's nothing I can do.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.521
Too much food, too much liquor.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.441
But for a pirate, nothing is ever enough.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.278
Good thing we have Marines like yourselves
to keep the East Blue safe.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.405
Now, if that is all,

08:09.489 --> 08:12.074
I really must return to my duties.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.495
Wait. I just have a few more questions.

08:16.829 --> 08:17.788
Of course.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.574
-What was that?
-Old houses.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.995
You know, they're just like us.
The older they get, the more they creak.

08:58.079 --> 08:58.913
You sure?

09:00.122 --> 09:00.957
It sounded like--

09:01.040 --> 09:04.877
I shall stick to my expertise
and leave you to yours.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.464
You do have your fugitive in hand
after all.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.968
-He's lying. Everything he says--
-That's enough out of you.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.434
[Usopp] Help! Please!
Pirates! Somebody, help!

09:20.518 --> 09:23.563
Please, pirates! Someone, help, please!

09:23.646 --> 09:25.189
Can't reason with madness.

09:26.274 --> 09:30.194
Now, I really must return to my duties.

We're not friends, Kuina.
And I don't need advice from you.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.523

11:31.565 --> 11:34.360
Have you learned anything
during your time here?

Don't mock me!
I'm the best fighter here other than you.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.200
And one day, I'm gonna surpass you.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.703
Then I'm gonna be
the world's greatest swordsman.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.037
Maybe one day.

11:47.039 --> 11:47.957
But not today.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.380
I know why I can't beat you.
It's these bamboo swords.

11:54.463 --> 11:57.007
Let's fight with real blades
to see who's best.

11:59.927 --> 12:00.761
Fine.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.097
Katanas it is.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.933
But if you want to beat me,

12:06.892 --> 12:08.853
you'd better be ready to kill me.

[metal hook clangs]

12:27.288 --> 12:29.749
[Zoro] Okay. Plan B.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.589
Open the window!

12:37.506 --> 12:38.883
-Usopp?
-[Usopp] Yeah, hurry up.

Hurry up. Come on.

[Usopp panting]

12:45.723 --> 12:46.557
Kaya.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.685
There's pirates in the house.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.647
I know. You invited them.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.317
No, not those pirates. The other pirates.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.943
[panting] You're in danger.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.405
-Usopp, you're not making any sense.
-Please, Kaya, we gotta get out of here.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.699
I'm not going anywhere.
It's the middle of the night.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.911
How about I ring for Klahadore?
We can have--

13:06.994 --> 13:09.705
No, don't call Klahadore!

13:11.332 --> 13:12.583
He's the one trying to hurt you.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.462
He killed Merry.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.464
Merry?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.300
He was here only a few hours ago.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.052
Yeah. Now he's dead.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.679
Klahadore isn't a butler.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.722
He's…

13:27.389 --> 13:28.766
he's a vicious pirate.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.019
Usopp, you're scaring me.

13:33.437 --> 13:38.609
Klahadore gave up his life to care for me.
Why would he want to hurt me? Hurt Merry?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.027
I… I don't know.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.530
Maybe he wants your money.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.492
Usopp.

13:48.869 --> 13:49.954
Kaya,

13:50.037 --> 13:53.958
please, just believe me.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.209
You always believe me.

13:55.292 --> 13:59.088
I believed your stories
because they were fun. This one isn't.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.382
This isn't a story.
It's the truth. You gotta listen!

14:01.465 --> 14:02.716
[Kaya grunts]

14:07.721 --> 14:09.640
I don't think you know
what the truth is anymore.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.810
I think you should go, Usopp.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.022
-Kaya…
-Please.

14:18.899 --> 14:19.733
Just go.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.165
No.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.043
I'm done running.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.010
I'm not leaving your side.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.471
Not until I know you're safe.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.364
Sham!

15:09.033 --> 15:09.992
[grunts]

15:11.285 --> 15:12.536
What the hell happened?

15:14.580 --> 15:15.956
The orange-haired girl.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.125
She was hiding.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.877
She overheard everything.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.962
And you let her get away?

15:22.046 --> 15:24.048
She came out of nowhere.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.383
[clock chiming]

15:31.347 --> 15:33.307
[Kuro] The time for waiting is over.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.685
Kaya is of age.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.730
And we can finally put this farce to bed.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.358
So we kill her now?

15:43.859 --> 15:45.277
Yes, Buchi.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.238
No more hiding who we are.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.743
And to be absolutely certain
we're not interrupted,

15:54.620 --> 15:55.829
lock the house down.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.122
Yes, Captain.

What's that?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.529
[Kaya] The security shutters.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.864
My parents built them
to keep the pirates out.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.826
But now they're keeping the pirates in…
with us.

Thank God you're still alive.

What are you talking about?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.739
I overheard them in the kitchen.
It's been going on for years.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.493
-Did Usopp put you up to this?
-[Usopp] I didn't even know.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.874
I gave you that tea.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.086
[Nami] Think about it, Kaya.
When did you start getting sick?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.255
Was it around the time
Kuro started working here?

17:31.383 --> 17:32.217
Listen to me.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.972
If we stay here, we die.
We have to leave now.

Oh, Miss Kaya.

Why,

18:06.710 --> 18:08.295
Your friends are all gone.

It's just you and me, Miss Kaya.

Where are we going?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.992
[Usopp] We gotta get out of the house.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.911
[Kaya] Another crank
can open the shutters.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.205
It's in my parents' bedroom
in the east wing.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.382
[Usopp] Are you sure?
Maybe there's another way.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.009

We'll keep getting better and stronger

you could get the best of me?

I'm Kuro of the Thousand Plans.

No, you poor, poor sap.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.008
So you think you want to be a pirate?

43:14.091 --> 43:16.010
I am a pirate.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.053
[Kuro laughs]

43:20.764 --> 43:24.351
And how long have you been on the seas?
A week? A month?

43:26.562 --> 43:28.480
I was a captain for years,

43:28.564 --> 43:30.524
and I never failed in a raid.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.151
Not once.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.486
And what did I get in return?

43:35.195 --> 43:36.196
A life of worry

43:36.280 --> 43:39.575
and a target on my back
as wide as the East Blue.

looking over your shoulder.

a peaceful night's rest

to slit your throat.

Pirates, Marines.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.518
Why, even your own crew.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.605
Not my crew.

44:11.899 --> 44:13.609
We've got each other's backs.

Always.

[Kuro] Until the day they don't.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.743
I've killed more crewmates
than I care to remember.

Being a pirate is not about
raiding villages or perfect plans.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.085
It's about adventure.

45:14.211 --> 45:15.045
And freedom.

[Kuro laughs]

45:21.135 --> 45:22.177
[Kuro] Freedom?

45:23.262 --> 45:26.098
There's no such thing
with a bounty on your head.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.562
You gave up on your dream.

45:33.897 --> 45:37.192
No one who does that
can ever call themselves a pirate.

[Kuro laughs]

45:52.708 --> 45:54.960
Looks like you're the one giving up now.
