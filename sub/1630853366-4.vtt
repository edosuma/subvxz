WEBVTT

01:18.743 --> 01:20.954
- What am I looking for, buddy?

01:20.954 --> 01:22.747
Monsters.

01:22.747 --> 01:24.874
- Oh.

01:24.874 --> 01:27.252
Well, just don't hang anything
over the side of the bed,

01:27.252 --> 01:29.504
and they can't get you.
Everybody knows that.

01:29.504 --> 01:31.589
- But Mama scares them away.

01:31.589 --> 01:34.009
- Oh, well, she is scarier
than me.

01:34.009 --> 01:35.635
Look, if I see them,
I'll tell them

01:35.635 --> 01:37.637
that Mom gets home
from her retreat tomorrow,

01:37.637 --> 01:40.056
so they're gonna
have to get you tonight.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.933
- No!

01:41.933 --> 01:45.395
Come on, your sister's asleep.

01:45.395 --> 01:48.523
I'll tell them
to go after her, okay?

01:48.523 --> 01:50.775
Good night, bud.
- Good night.

04:24.721 --> 04:27.223
- I'm home.
Where are my rug rats?

04:27.223 --> 04:28.433
Where is...
Mom!

04:28.433 --> 04:30.268
- Oh, there you are!

04:30.268 --> 04:33.229
Hello, my loves.
I missed you.

04:57.921 --> 05:00.465
You found out
about her affair,

05:00.465 --> 05:03.885
and you bought her
a card and flowers?

05:03.885 --> 05:05.470
I blamed myself.

05:08.598 --> 05:11.226
I think I still do.

05:11.226 --> 05:14.813
I think that a big part
of her relationship with Allan

05:14.813 --> 05:18.942
was one of just having
a friend, someone to talk to.

05:18.942 --> 05:21.319
I feel that in my own
relationship with her,

05:21.319 --> 05:25.281
perhaps I wasn't open enough.

05:25.281 --> 05:29.160
Perhaps after ten years
of marriage, that...

05:29.160 --> 05:34.123
she thought that I was
taking her for granted

05:34.123 --> 05:37.168
and that I wasn't
sharing myself with her enough.

05:38.878 --> 05:41.005
But we worked
our way through it,

05:41.005 --> 05:43.299
and I think it was
a positive working through.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.596
- Well, in those--
those ten years of marriage

05:48.596 --> 05:51.391
have you ever seen
your wife involved

05:51.391 --> 05:55.353
in any verbal altercation,
any physical violence,

05:55.353 --> 05:56.396
of any kind?

05:56.396 --> 05:57.564
- No, never.

05:57.564 --> 06:00.650
No, I love my wife
and I stand by her.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.735
She's a nonviolent person.

06:29.053 --> 06:30.096
Diffy.

06:32.390 --> 06:33.391
What?

06:35.643 --> 06:38.479
Yup.
All right.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.079
Got here right around
the same time.

08:18.079 --> 08:22.125
- Same time?
- Pretty close after.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.127
- Diffy.
- Diff.

08:24.127 --> 08:27.088
- Denny, Dave.

08:27.088 --> 08:30.049
Gentlemen,
I'm Deputy Steve Deffibaugh.

08:30.049 --> 08:31.801
You are?

08:31.801 --> 08:35.054
- I'm Richard.
I live across the street.

08:35.054 --> 08:37.724
- Jerry.
Down the street.

08:37.724 --> 08:39.726
- Lester.
Down the way.

08:39.726 --> 08:42.437
We're the ones that found her.

08:42.437 --> 08:47.400
- Allan, the husband, called us
and asked us to have a look,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.153
and we took the baby
next door too.

08:51.529 --> 08:54.490
- There was a baby?
Yeah.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.701
Little Valerie,

08:56.701 --> 08:59.662
She...

08:59.662 --> 09:04.000
she cried so long
that her voice went hoarse.

09:12.425 --> 09:13.926
Where'd you say
the husband was?

09:13.926 --> 09:18.556
- Uh, St. Paul,
for business, I think.

09:18.556 --> 09:21.976
- Uh-huh.

09:21.976 --> 09:24.061
All right, well,

09:24.061 --> 09:27.523
thank you for your, uh,
attention to this matter.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.192
You got their information?
- Yup.

09:29.192 --> 09:30.568
- Okay.

09:30.568 --> 09:32.361
Probably best you boys go on
and get home

09:32.361 --> 09:34.655
and leave the rest of it to us.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.365
- Yes, sir.

10:00.014 --> 10:03.184
- Did what we could
to help protect any prints.

10:07.271 --> 10:10.274
- This is, uh...

10:10.274 --> 10:11.859
shoot, I wish I'd have brought

10:11.859 --> 10:13.694
more than just
one roll of film.

10:17.615 --> 10:18.825
Hello.

10:24.413 --> 10:26.207
Look at that.

10:26.207 --> 10:28.876
You see that one right there?

10:28.876 --> 10:30.169
Different.

10:31.462 --> 10:35.299
Oh, yeah.
This here, this is our guy.

10:35.299 --> 10:36.717
Now, when we get done,
I want you to cut

10:36.717 --> 10:38.553
this here square
out the linoleum.

10:38.553 --> 10:42.431
We'll take it with us.
Evidence.

10:42.431 --> 10:43.599
- Okay.

10:47.228 --> 10:49.397
- Go on and get you some air.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.792
Huh.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.673
Gotcha.

11:15.673 --> 11:19.886
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Sunglass lens.

11:19.886 --> 11:22.013
Look what I found.

11:22.013 --> 11:24.015
Dang it, Dave.

11:24.015 --> 11:25.391
Now look, I know you got

11:25.391 --> 11:27.185
the best of intentions,
but you don't go

11:27.185 --> 11:30.146
picking stuff up
from a crime scene.

11:30.146 --> 11:31.856
Now go on and put it back
just where you found it.

11:31.856 --> 11:33.357
Show me.
- Well, it was in the garage.

11:33.357 --> 11:35.067
Well, go on.

11:36.777 --> 11:37.778
- All right.

11:39.906 --> 11:41.991
Just like this here.

11:41.991 --> 11:43.451
- Okay.

11:55.963 --> 11:58.132
- There's more blood
in the bathroom.

12:10.394 --> 12:12.980
So they half-assed the cleanup,

12:12.980 --> 12:15.358
left the murder weapon behind,

12:15.358 --> 12:18.110
and took the time
to take a shower.

12:20.404 --> 12:23.032
- All while a baby cried
in the background.

12:45.513 --> 12:47.473
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:44.697 --> 13:47.116
Allan Gore?
- Yeah.

13:47.116 --> 13:48.826
- I'm Deputy Steve Deffibaugh,

13:48.826 --> 13:51.370
the Collin County
Sheriff's Department.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.789
- Pleasure to meet you.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.374
Mr. Gore,
I know that your neighbors

13:55.374 --> 13:57.293
told you that your wife
had been shot,

13:57.293 --> 14:01.547
but, um, well,
there's more to it than that.

14:09.555 --> 14:12.558
Now, you, uh--you left
in the morning, right?

14:12.558 --> 14:15.144
And, uh, she seemed just fine.

14:15.144 --> 14:19.065
Can you tell me what the rest
of your wife's day is like?

14:20.983 --> 14:23.778
- Well, I don't know much.

14:23.778 --> 14:25.821
She called my boss
at one point.

14:25.821 --> 14:29.992
- Mm. Called your boss?
What for?

14:29.992 --> 14:32.119
- Oh, she was trying
to convince him

14:32.119 --> 14:34.330
not to send me away
for the weekend.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.791
She didn't like it
when I went on work trips.

14:36.791 --> 14:38.167
- Hmm.

14:38.167 --> 14:40.127
What happens
on these weekend work trips?

14:41.962 --> 14:45.424
- Nothing much, just work.

14:45.424 --> 14:47.885
- Hmm.

14:47.885 --> 14:51.472
I am sorry, I gotta ask.

14:51.472 --> 14:55.226
Has there ever been
anyone outside the nuptials?

14:59.230 --> 15:01.982
- Uh...

15:01.982 --> 15:06.403
she did...
have a one-night stand.

15:06.403 --> 15:07.947
Once.

15:07.947 --> 15:11.200
A few years ago.
We worked that out.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.618
Ancient history.

15:12.618 --> 15:16.747
- Mm-hmm, and you?
You ever stepped out?

15:16.747 --> 15:19.625
- Me?

15:19.625 --> 15:22.461
No, never.

15:25.422 --> 15:28.217
- Mr. Gore, is there anyone

15:28.217 --> 15:30.719
who could've seen
your wife yesterday?

15:30.719 --> 15:33.097
Somebody we could talk to?

15:33.097 --> 15:35.224
Friend, family member,
a neighbor?

15:35.224 --> 15:37.893
- Yeah, Candy was here
in the morning.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.062
She said
everything seemed fine.

15:40.062 --> 15:41.564
- Candy?
- Montgomery.

15:41.564 --> 15:44.316
She's...she's a friend.

15:45.985 --> 15:48.404
- Candy Montgomery.

15:48.404 --> 15:52.116
Who...who could've done this?

15:53.826 --> 15:56.829
I mean, some maniac?

15:56.829 --> 15:59.790
Well...

15:59.790 --> 16:01.876
possible, I guess.

16:01.876 --> 16:04.420
Uh...

16:04.420 --> 16:08.757
but seeing how there's
no forced entry or break-in,

16:08.757 --> 16:11.969
most likely,
it's, uh, somebody she knew.

16:13.637 --> 16:16.807
Somebody that, uh,
didn't like her much at all.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.394
Does that ring any bells?

16:22.730 --> 16:25.024
I can't think of anyone.

16:27.985 --> 16:31.322
- Now, you were out of town.
That is an alibi.

16:31.322 --> 16:33.449
But, uh, as a formality,

16:33.449 --> 16:36.035
I'd like to see
your bank statements.

16:38.621 --> 16:42.958
- Oh, yeah.
Sure.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.377
- Thank you.

17:08.651 --> 17:11.779
- Christina.

17:11.779 --> 17:13.364
Did you know
that we're magnetic?

17:15.199 --> 17:17.493
Yeah, our whole family,
we're magnetic.

17:17.493 --> 17:18.786
No.

17:18.786 --> 17:19.828
Yeah, we are.

17:19.828 --> 17:21.455
Watch. I'll prove it.

17:21.455 --> 17:23.666
Is that a real penny?
You don't know?

17:23.666 --> 17:24.917
Okay, well this is
how you find out.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.919
Go ahead, put it in your mouth.

17:26.919 --> 17:29.129
There you go. Yeah.
Does it taste kind of weird?

17:29.129 --> 17:30.422
Yeah.
That's because it's real.

17:30.422 --> 17:32.883
All right, take it out.
Put it on your forehead.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.512
- What'd I tell ya?

17:36.512 --> 17:37.555
- What?
- Yeah.

17:37.555 --> 17:38.973
- Oh, my gosh.

17:38.973 --> 17:40.641
Yeah, yeah.

17:40.641 --> 17:42.393
It's incredible, right?

17:42.393 --> 17:43.561
Has something to do with

17:43.561 --> 17:45.229
where the house is
on the Earth.

17:45.229 --> 17:46.689
I don't know
the science behind it,

17:46.689 --> 17:48.774
but I don't know,
we're all magnetic.

17:48.774 --> 17:49.984
Spend enough time here,

17:49.984 --> 17:51.610
you turn into a magnet too.

17:51.610 --> 17:52.736
Either that
or you're a robot.

17:52.736 --> 17:53.821
I don't know which.

17:53.821 --> 17:55.698
I don't know which one.
Try it.

18:00.661 --> 18:03.163
Do you want me to get it?

18:03.163 --> 18:05.332
- Oh. No, no, no.
I'll get it.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.919
- Okay, let me try this
one more time

18:08.919 --> 18:11.839
just to make sure.
- Okay.

18:11.839 --> 18:13.424
- Montgomery residence.

18:13.424 --> 18:16.468
- Oh, Lord, Candy.
Did you hear?

18:16.468 --> 18:18.595
What kind of maniac
is in the neighborhood?

18:18.595 --> 18:20.431
I'm scared to even be
by my windows.

18:20.431 --> 18:22.349
- Did you hear she got shot?

18:22.349 --> 18:24.935
She wasn't shot.

18:24.935 --> 18:26.353
It was an axe.

19:11.815 --> 19:13.317
Mommy!

19:13.317 --> 19:15.611
- Hey, over here, babe.

19:15.611 --> 19:17.613
Hi.

19:17.613 --> 19:21.492
Oh, nice to see you.
- Where's Mommy?

19:21.492 --> 19:23.577
Well...

19:23.577 --> 19:24.828
What is it?

19:24.828 --> 19:29.208
- Um...
something's happened, baby.

19:30.793 --> 19:33.796
Uh, something terrible
has happened.

19:33.796 --> 19:36.173
And I want you to know

19:36.173 --> 19:37.758
that I love you and I'm gonna

19:37.758 --> 19:40.344
take care of you
no matter what.

19:40.344 --> 19:44.139
But your mom, she...

19:44.139 --> 19:47.059
sh-she's gone, baby.

19:47.059 --> 19:49.395
She went to heaven,

19:49.395 --> 19:51.188
and she ain't coming back.

19:53.857 --> 19:56.610
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

19:56.610 --> 19:59.697
Please don't cry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

19:59.697 --> 20:02.574
I'm so sorry.
Don't cry, baby.

20:02.574 --> 20:04.034
I am so sorry.

20:04.034 --> 20:06.995
I love you,
I love you, I love you.

20:06.995 --> 20:09.206
I'm so sorry,

20:09.206 --> 20:12.084
and I wish I could tell you
something different.

20:19.383 --> 20:21.385
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

20:23.095 --> 20:26.807
I'm so sorry.

20:26.807 --> 20:30.060
I'm so sorry.
Come here.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.729
Come here.
I love you.

20:33.856 --> 20:35.816
I'm gonna
take care of you, okay?

20:35.816 --> 20:38.902
I promise.
My sweet little girl.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.459
Thank you.

20:53.459 --> 20:57.045
It was a real comfort
knowing Christina was with you.

20:59.631 --> 21:03.469
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

21:03.469 --> 21:06.221
It's okay.

21:18.275 --> 21:20.068
- Look, I'm gonna
go around the house

21:20.068 --> 21:24.114
and just check all the locks,
every door, every window.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.829
- Hon?
- I'm sorry.

21:30.829 --> 21:33.832
I'm just so glad
you weren't there.

21:54.311 --> 21:57.731
And that's when I knew
I should just come on back.

21:57.731 --> 22:01.485
After Dave and I's
second divorce,

22:01.485 --> 22:04.446
I know how hard it can be
to try to go on.

22:04.446 --> 22:05.781
And I thought,

22:05.781 --> 22:07.491
"I don't know that Allan even
knows how to cook,

22:07.491 --> 22:08.700
"and now he has
a daughter to feed,

22:08.700 --> 22:10.285
and I just can't abide
by that."

22:10.285 --> 22:13.789
And since I'm single again,

22:13.789 --> 22:18.001
I knew that I could make dinner
at the drop of a hat.

22:21.547 --> 22:23.799
You'll thank me for that
later, pumpkin.

22:25.843 --> 22:28.512
- Thank you for this, Elaine.
I didn't even think about--

22:28.512 --> 22:29.763
Hush.

22:29.763 --> 22:31.765
You don't need to worry
about any of this.

22:31.765 --> 22:34.851
But in the long term,
you're gonna need somebody.

22:34.851 --> 22:36.228
That sweet baby's
still in diapers.

22:36.228 --> 22:38.480
Do you know
how to change a diaper?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.109
- I don't,
but I am an engineer.

22:43.569 --> 22:46.405
Well, I can show you.

22:46.405 --> 22:48.282
I changed her
before I got her down,

22:48.282 --> 22:50.325
and I'll check on her
again after dinner.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.161
Christina, if you chew more,
you'll eat less.

22:53.161 --> 22:55.080
You'll thank me for that
when you get older too.

22:59.001 --> 23:02.254
Dad, uh, can I go to my room?

23:02.254 --> 23:05.132
- Yeah, just say thank you
to Miss Elaine, sweetheart.

23:05.132 --> 23:08.218
- Thank you, Miss Elaine.
- You're so welcome, puddin'.

23:16.518 --> 23:19.521
You need to speak to a lawyer.

23:19.521 --> 23:21.273
I read a lot of Robert Parker,

23:21.273 --> 23:22.733
and I've seen a lot of Columbo,

23:22.733 --> 23:26.361
and they always look
at the husband first.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.864
Sometimes it's insurance
or another woman,

23:28.864 --> 23:31.909
but it's always
either love or money.

23:31.909 --> 23:35.913
You didn't take out
any large sums of money

23:35.913 --> 23:38.081
for any reason recently,
did you?

23:38.081 --> 23:42.085
Because they might think,
contract killer.

23:54.306 --> 23:57.142
- This is Diffy.
This is Allan Gore.

23:57.142 --> 23:59.770
Um, I just felt like
you should know

23:59.770 --> 24:02.939
because, uh, you asked me
about the bank statements

24:02.939 --> 24:07.444
that I took out a large sum
of traveler's checks yesterday.

24:07.444 --> 24:09.446
My wife and I, we were--

24:09.446 --> 24:12.157
we were going on vacation
to Europe.

24:12.157 --> 24:14.284
- Okay.
Thank you for that.

24:14.284 --> 24:16.161
- Because I heard
that you look at the husband

24:16.161 --> 24:19.414
sometimes for love
or for moneys.

24:19.414 --> 24:23.168
So I just wanted to tell you
about the money.

24:23.168 --> 24:25.003
- Hmm.

24:25.003 --> 24:26.463
- I still have them,
by the way,

24:26.463 --> 24:28.965
if you, uh--
if you want to see them.

24:28.965 --> 24:31.677
I'd appreciate that,
yeah.

24:31.677 --> 24:33.136
- Sure.

24:33.136 --> 24:34.930
And...

24:34.930 --> 24:37.891
well, I wasn't exactly truthful

24:37.891 --> 24:41.728
with you earlier, but, um...

24:41.728 --> 24:43.730
I did have an affair

24:43.730 --> 24:45.941
with Candice Montgomery.

24:50.028 --> 24:52.197
The one that was
with your wife

24:52.197 --> 24:54.032
at your house
yesterday morning?

24:54.032 --> 24:55.283
- Yes.

24:55.283 --> 24:57.869
I didn't mention it
because like I said,

24:57.869 --> 25:01.790
it was--
it was over a long time ago.

25:01.790 --> 25:03.291
- Can I ask you why it ended?

25:05.919 --> 25:08.797
- Well, Candy was
in love with me.

25:08.797 --> 25:10.298
- Mm-hmm.

25:10.298 --> 25:12.634
And things were going
so well with my wife

25:12.634 --> 25:15.512
that I just...I just felt like

25:15.512 --> 25:17.723
I couldn't
share myself anymore.

25:21.643 --> 25:23.019
- I see.

25:25.313 --> 25:29.317
- Okay, then.
I do apologize.

25:29.317 --> 25:31.820
All right.
Have a good one, Mr. Gore.

25:31.820 --> 25:33.029
- Good night.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.253
- Okay.

26:37.677 --> 26:40.680
Oh.

27:01.159 --> 27:03.370
Montgomery residence.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.121
Yes, this is she.

27:08.125 --> 27:12.546
Oh, I-I want to be
as-as helpful as I can.

27:14.923 --> 27:17.884
Right.
Okay.

27:17.884 --> 27:19.511
Well, I will see you
tomorrow then.

27:19.511 --> 27:21.596
Bright and early.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.848
Okay, good night.

27:31.022 --> 27:32.899
It was the police.

27:32.899 --> 27:34.109
- Oh.

27:47.831 --> 27:50.041
Y'all should know

27:50.041 --> 27:53.920
I did have an affair
with Allan Gore,

27:53.920 --> 27:57.799
but it--well, it has
nothing to do with all of this.

27:57.799 --> 28:01.386
I-I ended it.
I ended it a long time ago.

28:05.599 --> 28:09.144
- So you ended it?
Yes.

28:09.144 --> 28:11.813
It had run its course

28:11.813 --> 28:15.609
for me and Allan.

28:15.609 --> 28:19.779
- So you don't have
any feelings for Mr. Gore?

28:19.779 --> 28:22.449
- Oh, only friendly ones.

28:22.449 --> 28:25.035
Only friendly ones.

28:27.579 --> 28:31.291
- Ooh, you broke
a fingernail there.

28:31.291 --> 28:33.627
Uh...
- Oh, a couple.

28:33.627 --> 28:35.503
Yup.

28:35.503 --> 28:38.590
- Yeah. So brittle.

28:38.590 --> 28:41.217
I try to grow 'em, but I can't.
- Yeah.

28:41.217 --> 28:43.386
Let me know
if you have any tips.

28:43.386 --> 28:45.430
- Nope.

28:45.430 --> 28:47.182
Well, all right,
we're gonna need to take

28:47.182 --> 28:49.768
a few pictures of you,
just for our records.

28:49.768 --> 28:52.604
You're okay with that?

28:52.604 --> 28:55.106
- I would love to help
anyway I can.

29:00.987 --> 29:02.113
All right.

29:04.991 --> 29:06.409
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

29:09.329 --> 29:11.539
Got something
on your shoe there.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.835
Oh.

29:15.835 --> 29:17.963
I keep kicking my storm door,

29:17.963 --> 29:19.881
and I can't seem
to get my husband to fix it.

29:22.258 --> 29:23.593
- Hmm.

29:23.593 --> 29:25.762
You mind if I get
a picture of your cut?

29:25.762 --> 29:28.390
Just to have.

29:28.390 --> 29:31.393
- Well, sure.
Thank you very much.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.401
- Whoa.

29:40.944 --> 29:43.989
That's some pretty nasty
bruises you got there.

29:43.989 --> 29:46.032
- Oh, yeah, I got those
playing with my kids.

29:46.032 --> 29:49.202
I bruise if the wind
hits me wrong.

29:49.202 --> 29:50.245
Hmm.

29:53.873 --> 29:55.458
That'll do.
- All right.

30:05.468 --> 30:09.014
Ms. Montgomery?

30:09.014 --> 30:11.266
Did you kill Betty Gore?

30:16.146 --> 30:19.107
No.

30:19.107 --> 30:21.776
- And you'd be willing to take
a polygraph test to that?

30:23.737 --> 30:25.447
- Yes, of course.

30:35.457 --> 30:39.419
- "Just to tell you something,
and it's no exaggeration,

30:39.419 --> 30:41.296
"there's just no greater
pop than you

30:41.296 --> 30:43.757
in all the pop-ulation."

30:44.966 --> 30:48.219
I love it.
Thank you.

30:48.219 --> 30:49.512
Here you go, Daddy.

30:49.512 --> 30:50.597
Thanks.
Come on.

30:50.597 --> 30:53.141
All right, let's see.

30:53.141 --> 30:58.229
"Dad, everything you do
is magic."

31:00.815 --> 31:02.192
You know,
that's how we got you.

31:02.192 --> 31:03.234
We pulled you out of a hat.

31:03.234 --> 31:05.320
- What? No.
- No, we did.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.780
- Where'd you get me?

31:06.780 --> 31:10.533
- Oh, we got you under a rock
in, uh...Tennessee?

31:10.533 --> 31:12.035
- Tennessee.
Tennessee.

31:12.035 --> 31:14.329
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

31:14.329 --> 31:16.247
- All right.

31:16.247 --> 31:18.374
Fried spaghetti
and scrambled eggs.

31:18.374 --> 31:20.418
My favorite.
Must be my day.

31:20.418 --> 31:21.878
It is.

31:21.878 --> 31:23.755
- Oh, did y'all say,
"Happy Father's Day"?

31:23.755 --> 31:26.091
Happy Father's Day!

31:26.091 --> 31:27.092
Thank you.

31:28.718 --> 31:32.138
Aww, you too?
- Of course.

31:34.933 --> 31:37.519
"My sweet honey,

31:37.519 --> 31:40.939
happy Father's Day
from your queen bee."

31:40.939 --> 31:42.607
Buzz, buzz.

31:42.607 --> 31:44.818
Yeah, you are.

31:44.818 --> 31:46.820
You are, hon.
Love you.

31:46.820 --> 31:49.197
Love you, Daddy.

31:49.197 --> 31:52.909
I love you guys too.
Thank you.

31:52.909 --> 31:54.744
I'm the luckiest dad
in the whole world.

34:01.746 --> 34:03.248
Comfort and luxury

34:03.248 --> 34:05.917
with the convenience
of four-wheel drive.

34:05.917 --> 34:08.378
There's more to an AMC.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.966
This is Action News.

34:12.966 --> 34:14.467
- New information
has come to light

34:14.467 --> 34:16.928
in the grisly axe slaying
of Betty Gore.

34:16.928 --> 34:18.930
Sources report
a female friend of the family

34:18.930 --> 34:20.682
was brought in
for questioning.

34:20.682 --> 34:22.934
The female's identity
and exact relationship

34:22.934 --> 34:25.395
to the Gores
remains in question.

34:25.395 --> 34:28.022
Authorities say
Mrs. Gore was struck

34:28.022 --> 34:30.191
41 times with an axe--

35:05.435 --> 35:07.854
- Oh, God damn it.

35:29.042 --> 35:33.212
Hi, Bob. It's me.

35:33.212 --> 35:34.631
Uh, Allan.

35:36.424 --> 35:40.053
Look, before you guys
get down here, I just...

35:40.053 --> 35:43.222
there's something that I wanted
to tell you, and...

35:46.684 --> 35:49.729
Look, Bob, the-the local news

35:49.729 --> 35:52.023
is really heating up down here,

35:52.023 --> 35:54.233
and so it's only
a matter of time, I imagine,

35:54.233 --> 35:57.570
before you're hearing it
up there in Kansas.

35:57.570 --> 36:00.573
There's a woman
who the police questioned,

36:00.573 --> 36:03.659
and we know her.

36:03.659 --> 36:05.661
She was the last one
to see Betty.

36:05.661 --> 36:07.747
Uh...

36:07.747 --> 36:10.625
that's not everything, though.

36:15.171 --> 36:19.008
I had an affair with her, Bob.

36:19.008 --> 36:22.762
That was my daughter,
you son of a bitch.

36:22.762 --> 36:24.180
With everything else

36:24.180 --> 36:26.099
that she had to put up with
for you, and--

36:29.811 --> 36:33.940
- Hey, did you tell the kids
I was questioned?

36:33.940 --> 36:35.108
- Well, when you say it
like that,

36:35.108 --> 36:36.859
it sounds so sinister.

36:36.859 --> 36:38.361
You just went in
to help, right?

36:38.361 --> 36:39.695
- Of course.

36:39.695 --> 36:42.115
- Well,
that's what I told them.

36:42.115 --> 36:43.699
You know, that they don't
have to be scared

36:43.699 --> 36:45.868
and we can protect them.

36:45.868 --> 36:47.954
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, they were fine.

36:47.954 --> 36:48.996
- Okay.

36:58.589 --> 37:00.383
Montgomery residence.

37:00.383 --> 37:03.928
Did you hear?
They found a footprint.

38:07.366 --> 38:08.367
- Candy.

38:12.955 --> 38:14.749
What brings you here?

38:14.749 --> 38:16.626
- I spoke to the police.

38:16.626 --> 38:19.670
- A polygraph?
You've got to be kidding me.

38:19.670 --> 38:21.380
When you supposed
to go in for that?

38:21.380 --> 38:22.632
- Well, I'm supposed--
- Hold up.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.217
Udashen!

38:24.217 --> 38:25.843
Candy, you got a dollar on you?

38:25.843 --> 38:28.846
- Uh, well, I think--
I think I do.

38:30.348 --> 38:32.099
- Udashen!

38:34.685 --> 38:38.272
I'm officially retained
as counsel.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.440
Anything you tell me

38:39.440 --> 38:42.026
falls under
attorney-client privilege.

38:42.026 --> 38:43.361
- Oh.

38:43.361 --> 38:45.071
We're in the middle
of a murder investigation,

38:45.071 --> 38:46.781
the whole town is rattled,
and they think

38:46.781 --> 38:49.200
they can call a lady in
for a polygraph

38:49.200 --> 38:50.993
and her nerves won't
be shot to hell.

38:50.993 --> 38:53.162
Please!

38:53.162 --> 38:54.789
You'd probably set
the damn thing off

38:54.789 --> 38:57.667
within just a minute,
and from pure feeling alone.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.835
You're not doing it, Candy.
You're just not.

38:59.835 --> 39:01.045
There you are.

39:03.923 --> 39:06.843
Axe murderer.

39:06.843 --> 39:07.843
- Her?

39:07.843 --> 39:10.596
- Mm-hmm. Horse hockey.

39:10.596 --> 39:12.932
Didn't you throw Betty
a baby party?

39:12.932 --> 39:14.976
- Mm-hmm.

39:14.976 --> 39:17.103
- What were you doing Friday?

39:17.103 --> 39:18.771
Well, I was at Bible school.

39:18.771 --> 39:20.731
- Uh-huh.
- And then I went to Betty's

39:20.731 --> 39:22.650
and I got Christina's
bathing suit,

39:22.650 --> 39:23.943
and then Betty and I
got to talking,

39:23.943 --> 39:26.070
and then I went to Target and--

39:26.070 --> 39:27.280
well, when I got there,
I realized

39:27.280 --> 39:28.447
my watched had stopped

39:28.447 --> 39:30.408
and I was way later
than I thought,

39:30.408 --> 39:31.993
so I didn't go in.

39:31.993 --> 39:33.661
I just went back to church.

39:33.661 --> 39:35.329
- But you didn't go
back to church

39:35.329 --> 39:36.747
covered in blood, did you?

39:38.457 --> 39:40.334
- What--well, of course not.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.586
- Yeah,
what they're looking for

39:41.586 --> 39:43.087
is some kind of crazy drifter.

39:43.087 --> 39:44.589
A real psycho.

39:44.589 --> 39:46.299
Big, tall, strong man.

39:46.299 --> 39:48.926
Swinging an axe 41 times?

39:48.926 --> 39:50.678
That ain't easy.

39:50.678 --> 39:52.263
You know,
could be the same guy

39:52.263 --> 39:54.390
who did that axe murder
over in New Mexico.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.058
I mean, that can't
a coincidence, right?

39:56.058 --> 39:58.102
- Or a transient, like I said.

39:58.102 --> 40:00.730
Now, everyone knows
that you didn't do it.

40:00.730 --> 40:03.399
I mean, look at you.

40:03.399 --> 40:05.359
And the sheriff's got nothing.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.653
If they did,
there'd be a warrant.

40:07.653 --> 40:09.488
Okay?
They are out of their element.

40:09.488 --> 40:12.033
Don't you worry.
I'll give them a call.

40:12.033 --> 40:15.453
You'll be fine.
- Okay.

40:24.587 --> 40:28.090
- Hi. Thanks for coming.
- Oh, of course.

40:30.426 --> 40:34.639
- Oh, what a nice color
that is on you, pretty girl.

40:34.639 --> 40:37.141
But darling, I think you need
to get changed for the funeral.

40:37.141 --> 40:39.018
- I want to wear this.

40:39.018 --> 40:40.937
- Well...

40:40.937 --> 40:42.355
but, uh, sweetie,

40:42.355 --> 40:44.065
on days like today,
we wear black.

40:44.065 --> 40:47.276
Yellow's a happy color.
- I don't care.

40:50.488 --> 40:52.573
Everyone will be wearing black.

40:52.573 --> 40:54.825
That's just how this is done.

40:54.825 --> 40:57.370
Now, what will people think
of you in yellow?

40:59.038 --> 41:00.748
- Mommy made it for me.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.502
- That's so sweet,

41:04.502 --> 41:06.212
and you can wear it
all day afterwards.

41:06.212 --> 41:07.588
- I want to wear this!

41:09.090 --> 41:10.299
- Christina.

41:17.556 --> 41:19.308
- Let her have a lie down,
cool off.

41:19.308 --> 41:21.477
Mm-hmm.

41:21.477 --> 41:23.646
- We ought to leave
some of these ready.

41:23.646 --> 41:25.064
People will probably come by
after the service.

41:25.064 --> 41:27.233
- I'll take them over here.
- Okay.

41:27.233 --> 41:28.609
- Which one's that one?
- That's the macaroni.

41:28.609 --> 41:29.652
- Oh, the macar--okay,
the noodles.

41:29.652 --> 41:30.820
Yeah.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.780
The house looks nice.
Mm-hmm.

41:32.780 --> 41:34.824
- Elaine cleaned up
this morning.

41:34.824 --> 41:37.493
- Oh.
Wasn't that thoughtful?

41:37.493 --> 41:38.911
She's coming back later.

41:38.911 --> 41:41.080
She's gonna watch the baby
while we're at the funeral.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.958
- Well, the neighbors have you
in casseroles till Christmas.

41:43.958 --> 41:47.294
- Oh, there's another freezer
in the other room.

41:50.381 --> 41:51.716
Oh, boy.

41:51.716 --> 41:53.801
Uh...

41:53.801 --> 41:57.263
Maybe she needs a change?

41:57.263 --> 41:58.723
Oh...

42:05.563 --> 42:06.981
- I'll handle the food,

42:06.981 --> 42:10.443
and, uh, Sherry,
go ahead and help Allan.

42:10.443 --> 42:13.446
- All right, come on.

42:19.952 --> 42:22.371
Ooh, somebody's up.

42:22.371 --> 42:24.915
Hey there, baby girl.

42:24.915 --> 42:26.959
What seems to be the matter?

43:11.629 --> 43:13.631
- Sorry.

43:13.631 --> 43:15.341
I have no idea
what's gotten into them.

43:15.341 --> 43:18.093
- Ooh. I mean, dogs.

43:18.093 --> 43:23.140
And they just bark at every
little, tiny noise, you know?

43:23.140 --> 43:25.768
I mean, they're awfully cute.

43:37.279 --> 43:38.739
- Guess we ought to head off.

43:38.739 --> 43:40.574
- We should.
- All right.

44:23.325 --> 44:26.120
- It's okay, Grammy.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.746
- It's okay.

45:02.323 --> 45:05.618
- Bob, I'm...I'm so sorry.

45:09.121 --> 45:12.499
- She was so beautiful.

45:12.499 --> 45:16.754
Loving, smart,

45:16.754 --> 45:19.506
college educated,

45:19.506 --> 45:21.967
and so full of life.

45:21.967 --> 45:24.970
She had her pick,

45:24.970 --> 45:26.805
and she chose you.

45:54.917 --> 45:57.294
Oh.

45:57.294 --> 46:00.589
Think she's sleeping
with him too?

46:00.589 --> 46:03.550
- Yeah, all right now.

46:03.550 --> 46:05.427
- Just saying.

46:05.427 --> 46:07.471
Once you sleep with
one of your friends' husbands,

46:07.471 --> 46:09.682
what's to stop you
from sleeping with all of them?

47:47.821 --> 47:49.198
- Hon.
Hmm?

47:49.198 --> 47:50.532
- They found a fingerprint.

47:52.993 --> 47:56.914
- Fingerprint?
Yeah. That's it.

47:56.914 --> 48:00.334
God, they are gonna
nail this guy.

48:00.334 --> 48:02.169
We're gonna be able
to put this all behind us.

48:16.141 --> 48:18.477
- Why don't we have
a family night this weekend?

48:18.477 --> 48:20.312
Yeah, it's been a hard week.

48:20.312 --> 48:22.189
We can go to Sizzler,

48:22.189 --> 48:23.857
go see a movie.

48:23.857 --> 48:27.486
Becky's been asking to go see
Herbie Goes Bananas.

48:27.486 --> 48:28.904
- That's a great idea.

48:28.904 --> 48:30.030
Yeah?

48:30.030 --> 48:32.074
- Yeah.
Okay.

48:59.768 --> 49:02.521
Don?

49:02.521 --> 49:03.897
- Candy?

50:11.048 --> 50:12.591
- All right, yes, sir.
- Hug your kids.

50:12.591 --> 50:13.800
- Thank you.
- Okay.

50:28.232 --> 50:30.275
She did it.

50:30.275 --> 50:31.610
- No shit?

50:34.112 --> 50:35.989
- You're not gonna
believe this.

50:35.989 --> 50:38.367
- Oh, yeah?
Try me.

50:38.367 --> 50:41.203
- We got ourselves
a self-defense case.

52:13.629 --> 52:14.629
- One.

52:18.759 --> 52:19.926
Two.

52:23.722 --> 52:24.723
Three.

52:27.100 --> 52:28.101
Four.

52:32.397 --> 52:33.815
Ten.

52:52.709 --> 52:53.710
24.

52:58.882 --> 53:00.133
32.
