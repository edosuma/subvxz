00:13.388 --> 00:16.391
This is a message
to all American infidels.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.603
Prepare to die
in a sea of holy fire.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.649
You will be punished for your decadent
ways on the first day of Radaman.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.733
You...

00:24.816 --> 00:25.817
(all laughing)

00:25.943 --> 00:27.402
Wait. Wait a minute.
Did I just say...

00:27.486 --> 00:28.737
What did I say? "Radaman"?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.531
(stammering)

00:30.614 --> 00:31.615
Ramadan.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.700
Radaman. What is that?
What is...

00:33.784 --> 00:36.912
Yeah, maybe Dennis "Radaman"
is gonna punish you with his crazy hair.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.789
No?
MAN: Osama.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.584
What's that? Right, right.
Yeah, no. Okay, okay.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.253
All right,
let's go again. Okay.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.421
This is a message to all...

00:46.505 --> 00:47.881
(laughing)

00:47.965 --> 00:50.008
I'm not-- I'm not gonna
be able to do it now.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.427
Okay, all right, okay.
No, I just-- I got to get all the...

00:52.511 --> 00:54.263
I got to get all
the laughs out. Okay?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.764
I got to get all
the laughs out.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.725
(babbling)

00:58.809 --> 01:01.103
Okay, all right.
CAMERAMAN: Today sometime.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.146
Stop making
that face over there!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.565
-(all laughing)
-What are you doing? I can't...

01:04.648 --> 01:06.775
He makes that face
and it makes me laugh, okay?

01:06.859 --> 01:09.194
You know what,
just turn around. Turn--Turn around.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.655
I don't care where you look.
Just look over there. Okay, all right.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.282
They're-- They're--
They're cracking--

01:13.365 --> 01:15.450
They're cracking up
over there. Okay.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.703
Oh, yeah. Look who's
snickering over there.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.372
Mr. I-can't-do-
a-suicide-bombing- because-I'm-sick.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.748
He had a-- He had a note.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.958
MAN #1: He got you.
MAN #2: He's so bad.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.751
He had a note from his doctor.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.046
He brought a note
from his doctor. It's a suicide bombing.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.548
-MAN #1: It's true.
-What are you...

01:29.631 --> 01:31.175
Okay, all right.
Okay, all right. Here we go.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.927
This is where I get
all serious now. Okay. Death...

01:34.011 --> 01:35.304
(laughing)

01:35.387 --> 01:38.473
I can't. I can't do it.
I can't do it. I can't.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.350
Oh, come on.
Now you're just trying to make...

01:40.434 --> 01:42.352
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.521
Look, look,
rubber chicken, you know?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.357
I should do, like, the whole tape
with this in my hand, you know?

01:47.441 --> 01:50.694
Just totally, like, with the chicken
right here because everyone will be like,

01:50.777 --> 01:54.406
"What the hell? What-- What is--
What is 'Death to Americans'?"

01:54.489 --> 01:56.200
Just let him do it.
Let him do the tape.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.744
-CAMERAMAN: Talking chicken.
-Don't blame me. It was the chicken.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.662
He was...
Oh, no, no, no. Actually, no.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.998
You know what would be better?
Hey, wait, wait.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.209
Just walk out like this.
I just... Look...

02:05.292 --> 02:07.044
I just come out like this,
but just, like, all serious.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.046
Like this totally,
like, completely serious.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.839
Like... Like I don't even know
I'm wearing them.

02:10.923 --> 02:11.924
CAMERAMAN: Oh, man!

02:12.007 --> 02:14.176
Death. Death to America.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.761
What? What?
What are you looking at?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.596
What? Do I have-- Do I have
something on my face?

02:17.679 --> 02:21.517
What? What? Right here? What?
Boys, I'm just wearing my regular glasses.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.435
-I always wear these.
-CAMERAMAN: That is crazy.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.521
Hey, it's me
in an '80s movie, right? Yeah.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.356
(all laughing)

02:27.439 --> 02:30.025
Hey, he got it. He got it over there.
The little guy got it.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.402
Who is that guy?
I've never seen him around here before.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.571
How's it going, chief?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.616
Good day to you, sir.
And now prepare to die.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.785
(screams)

02:41.036 --> 02:42.788
(men groaning)

02:56.176 --> 02:57.344
(chicken squeaks)

03:10.440 --> 03:11.775
(groans)

03:13.986 --> 03:14.987
Who...

03:15.112 --> 03:16.113
Who are you?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.365
I'm Stewie Griffin.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.078
And don't ever let me
catch you guys in Quahog!

03:23.161 --> 03:25.330
(screaming)

03:27.291 --> 03:29.334
( Police Squad! theme playing)

03:31.503 --> 03:32.921
(cat meows aggressively)

03:33.922 --> 03:35.424
(people yelling)

03:37.176 --> 03:38.552
(all exclaiming)

03:44.224 --> 03:45.350
(twins gasping)

03:48.061 --> 03:49.771
(monster snarling)

03:53.400 --> 03:54.776
(laser guns firing)

04:00.199 --> 04:01.241
(groans)

04:06.079 --> 04:08.707
Hey, Stewie.
Who the hell is that?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.339
(staple gun firing)

04:17.633 --> 04:20.260
Peter, it's 5:30
in the morning.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.346
Oh, sorry, Lois.
I didn't know you were home.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.014
What the hell
are you doing?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.098
I'm laying down
the red carpet.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.558
The Emmys are on tonight.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.394
Oh, God. Don't tell me
you forgot about Meg's play tonight.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.896
But, Lois, Meg sucks!

04:30.979 --> 04:33.607
Everything she does
is so freaking terrible and depressing.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.776
Plus, I went to
her first grade play that one time.

04:35.859 --> 04:39.905
Oh, Robin Hood, the king is keeping me
prisoner here in his castle.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.157
Don't worry, Maid Marian,
I'll save you.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.993
Boy, you guys
are not sucking me into the story at all.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.204
I'm just telling you
for your own benefit.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.374
I'm-- I'm very aware
that I'm watching a play right now.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.750
Come on, I got to
watch the Emmys.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.378
Peter, you're going
to Meg's play and that's that.

04:54.461 --> 04:58.048
Is that that now,
Mrs. That's That?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.677
If you're gonna shoot me, you might
want to tie your shoelaces first.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.220
(Peter screams)

05:03.303 --> 05:05.556
Now, are you gonna go
to Meg's play or not?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.640
Yes!

05:06.723 --> 05:07.975
You like eating
red carpet, tough guy?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.101
Yes!

05:09.184 --> 05:10.519
Say you like
eating red carpet!

05:10.602 --> 05:13.063
PETER: I like
eating red carpet.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.690
Giggity.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.030
God, why do you wear
those rainbow suspenders?

05:22.114 --> 05:25.409
Well, I could tell you,
but I'd rather show you

05:25.492 --> 05:27.953
through interpretive dance.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.714
(wails)

05:38.797 --> 05:40.465
Crying baby.
I'll take him out.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.427
You know, Lois,
if we leave now,

05:43.510 --> 05:44.511
we can get home
and catch the Emmy

05:44.595 --> 05:45.804
for Best Documentary.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.515
Um, I hear there's one
on vacuuming.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.851
Really? Well,
that sounds interesting.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.687
Wait a minute. You can't
fool me that easily.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.773
You are not watching
the Emmys tonight. Now shush.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.238
Excuse me.
I got to go do some black guy stuff.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.448
(whines)

06:04.531 --> 06:07.284
Man, this sucks worse than
my 16th birthday party.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.537
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party, Jake Ryan.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.957
Thanks for having me at your birthday
party, Peter. Make a wish.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.084
It's already come true.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.337
Here's your present.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.339
No, Jake! Not like this!

06:20.422 --> 06:21.924
(Peter screams)

06:23.967 --> 06:27.054
Our top story,
beloved entertainer Bob Hope

06:27.137 --> 06:28.639
briefly came back
to life today

06:28.722 --> 06:30.807
only to die in a tragic
motorcycle accident.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.143
Hey, I'm gonna jump
all those trash cans.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.436
(chuckles)

06:38.899 --> 06:42.486
In other news, actor David Hyde Pierce
created a major controversy

06:42.569 --> 06:44.029
at the Emmys last night

06:44.112 --> 06:47.449
when a trouser malfunction
caused him to expose his testicles.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.201
Sure glad I didn't
miss the Emmys, Diane.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.911
Oh, that's just great, Lois.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.247
Thanks to you,
I missed a moment of television history.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.501
Well, now you know how George W. Bush
felt when he showed up in Vietnam.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.588
All right, let's do this.
Let's kick some ass.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.216
-Uh, George, the war is over.
-What?

07:04.299 --> 07:06.552
-Yeah, it's done. Get out of here!
-Are you serious?

07:06.635 --> 07:08.220
Yeah.
Oh, man! Oh, man!

07:08.303 --> 07:10.806
I just got your messages.
And I--I... Oh, I'm sorry.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.766
George, it's been
over for a while.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.893
Really?
Yeah. It's 1981.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.604
It's... Oh, oh, wow!
Oh, so I'm way late. Oh, boy!

07:17.688 --> 07:19.606
-Yeah. Well, you want to do
-something else?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.233
I got some blow.
Son of a bitch!

07:21.316 --> 07:23.861
It took you
this long to tell me? Break it out, man!

07:25.529 --> 07:28.949
Gentlemen, we got 20 calls
about the David Hyde Pierce incident.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.785
And as you know,
one call equals a billion people.

07:31.869 --> 07:35.038
Which means 20 billion people
were offended by this.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.915
Needless to say,
something must be done.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.792
Perhaps we should
ask the chairman.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.210
Good idea.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.088
Uh, sir, we're wondering
what course of action you recommend

07:43.172 --> 07:44.965
regarding
the Hyde Pierce incident.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.676
You've got to
censor television, you fools!

07:47.759 --> 07:49.595
Now follow my orders.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.520
TV ANNOUNCER:
And now, stay tuned for Three's Company.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.648
Jack, are you out there?
I want to show you my new bikini.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.651
What the hell! Why are they blocking out
all the good stuff?

08:04.735 --> 08:06.987
ANNOUNCER: It's
The (bleep) Van (bleep) Show

08:07.070 --> 08:09.156
starring (bleep) Van (bleep).

08:09.239 --> 08:11.158
They're messing
with my shows.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.160
Come to think of it,
there was something very different

08:13.243 --> 08:15.204
about that Honeymooners
episode I watched today.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.498
One of these days, Alice,
one of these days...

08:18.582 --> 08:21.710
I'm gonna help stimulate the economy
by buying an American car.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.464
This must be the FCC overreacting
to the David Hyde Pierce incident.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.175
They're censoring anything
that might be viewed as unpleasant.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.595
What the hell! They let
Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV,

08:31.678 --> 08:32.971
and she looks like a foot.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.599
Well, mark my words,
I'm gonna fight this.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.437
You're on TV, Mr. Tucker.
Can't you do something about this?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.773
Well, Peter, I'm flattered
you came to me for help.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.274
We'll have more after this.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.735
Good evening. We're back.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.861
Peter, to answer
your question,

08:47.945 --> 08:49.363
if you want to
control content,

08:49.446 --> 08:51.573
you'd have to start
your own television station.

08:51.657 --> 08:52.908
My own TV station?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.201
I haven't had
my own business

08:54.284 --> 08:56.119
since I ran that
mail order operation.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.206
Yeah, uh, I bought a giant,
life-size slingshot from you,

08:59.289 --> 09:00.791
and it just slammed me
into a mountain.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.875
Sorry, no returns.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.585
I've been a customer
here for years.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.045
I can maybe give you
a store credit.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.589
But... Really?
Well, I guess...

09:07.673 --> 09:08.882
What's the holdup in here?

09:08.966 --> 09:10.259
I'm taking care of it.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.096
Peter, what are you doing?
What is all this stuff?

09:14.179 --> 09:16.431
Dad's starting
his own TV station,

09:16.515 --> 09:18.058
but I'm not supposed
to tell Mom

09:18.141 --> 09:20.185
because she's just
gonna bitch him out.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.563
What the hell do you expect
to accomplish with this?

09:22.646 --> 09:24.398
I'm saving television, Lois.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.608
Apache Chief,
put the satellite on the roof.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.610
Sure, Peter. Apache Chief...

09:28.694 --> 09:30.279
(speaks native language)

09:33.949 --> 09:36.577
Well, that was
the high point of my day.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.370
Guess I'll go gamble.

09:47.004 --> 09:50.382
Hi, there. I'm Peter Griffin.
And you're watching PTV,

09:50.465 --> 09:53.385
where you get to watch your favorite shows
as nature intended them,

09:53.468 --> 09:56.847
with all the sex, violence,
swearing, and farts intact.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.098
Like the episode
of All in the Family

09:58.182 --> 10:00.517
where Archie got
the Jeffersons to move.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.313
Time for you
to move there, uh, Jefferson.

10:04.396 --> 10:08.609
Oh, Archie. I can't see
out of my sheet!

10:08.692 --> 10:10.277
Edith, will you
stifle yourself?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.446
We're supposed
to be incognitus.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.949
And who could forget
that classic episode of The Waltons?

10:16.033 --> 10:17.117
MARY ELLEN:
Good night, Jim-Bob.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.577
JIM-BOB:
Good night, Mary Ellen.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.954
Good night, Pa.
PA: Good night, Jim-Bob.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.956
Good night, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: Good night, Pa.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.626
Good night, Ma.
MA: Good night, Elizabeth.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.794
Good night, John-Boy.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.463
Good night, John-Boy.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.589
(footsteps)

10:30.672 --> 10:31.673
(door opening)

10:31.757 --> 10:33.133
John-Boy?

10:33.217 --> 10:35.928
JOHN-BOY: Damn it!
Can't a guy masturbate in this house?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.641
Peter, look
at these numbers. We're a hit.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.685
You know, if I were you, I'd think about
expanding your programming somehow.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.229
Brian, that's a great idea.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.524
That's exactly what we need
to take PTV to the next level.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.442
Original programming.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.153
STEWIE: Cheeky Bastard is filmed
in front of a live studio audience.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.280
Oh, my God! Where is
my roast pheasant?

10:55.364 --> 10:58.325
Hmm, by now I think it's
in my lower intestine.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.576
(laughter resonates)

10:59.660 --> 11:02.955
You ate it? But I told you my boss
was coming here for dinner.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.456
Well, unless
he likes pork rinds,

11:04.540 --> 11:06.166
he's going home hungry.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.751
(laughter resonates)

11:07.835 --> 11:09.503
You cheeky bastard.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.505
(laughter resonates)

11:11.588 --> 11:13.090
(man clapping)

11:14.842 --> 11:16.510
Welcome to Midnight Q.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.721
Tonight we're gonna
enjoy the smooth jazz of Charles Mingus.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.766
Norman Mailer is here
to read an excerpt from his latest book.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.769
And then we also have
a girl from Omaha who's hiding a banana.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.062
We'll find out where.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.524
Giggity, giggity, giggity goo.
Stick around.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.900
So, what do you think?

11:31.984 --> 11:33.277
I'm not sure, Peter.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.696
You gotta be careful about
what you put on your network.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.573
You know how impressionable
children are.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.200
I mean, remember what happened
after Chris saw Jackie Mason?

11:40.284 --> 11:42.536
Chris, you should have left
for school already.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.246
Oy, sister, don't start with me.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.707
I didn't go, I wanted
to go, I forgot to go, I should have gone.

11:46.790 --> 11:47.833
Chris, just go.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.210
Mom, relax, you look so
hagga-zabba-zell.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.421
You should lie down
or your heart might go pfft.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.425
(groans) More fan mail.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.219
Sheesh, Brian, people freaking love us.
We're gonna be huge.

11:59.303 --> 12:02.306
Peter, I really want you to cancel that
show with the animals having sex.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.058
For your information, Lois,
it's called Dogs Humping,

12:05.142 --> 12:07.853
and it is the cornerstone
of our Wednesday night lineup.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.980
Lois, responsibility
lies with the parents.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.108
There are plenty of things that are much
worse for children than television.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.611
Like when Peter baby-sat
for the neighbor's kid.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.614
All right, I couldn't
find your toys,

12:18.697 --> 12:21.658
so why don't you just play with
this blow dryer and these rattles?

12:21.742 --> 12:24.578
Well, guess that's it. You probably
want me to get out of your hair.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.664
So here's the Drano
in case there's a clog.

12:27.748 --> 12:31.793
Uh, soap's right there next to the radio,
and towels are on the roof.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.505
So, good night.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.299
Look, it's one thing
for a network to run inappropriate shows

12:37.382 --> 12:39.134
that I can't do
anything about.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.470
But I will not
have it happening in my own house.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.390
Lois, there is absolutely nothing
inappropriate about my programming.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.644
-Hi, there. And welcome
to The Peter Griffin -Side Boob Hour.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.104
A wonderful look back
on all the partial nudity

12:51.188 --> 12:53.273
network television
used to offer.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.901
Look at that side boob.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.570
Check out this side boob.

12:58.654 --> 13:02.157
How about that side boob?
That turn you on?

13:02.241 --> 13:06.036
Well, it shouldn't,
because that's my side boob.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.829
Good night, everybody.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.998
LOIS:
The Side Boob Hour?

13:10.082 --> 13:11.416
Peter, that's it.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.794
I asked you to stop this
and you didn't listen to me.

13:13.877 --> 13:18.173
I'm sorry, but you
left me no other choice. I called the FCC.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.009
Oh, yeah. I know
all about the FCC.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.261
(bouncy intro)

13:22.344 --> 13:24.179
They will clean up
all your talking

13:24.263 --> 13:26.014
In a manner such as this

13:26.098 --> 13:27.850
They will make you
take a tinkle

13:27.933 --> 13:29.685
When you want to
take a piss

13:29.768 --> 13:32.020
And they'll make you
call fellatio

13:32.104 --> 13:33.272
A trouser-friendly kiss

13:33.355 --> 13:35.357
Is the plain situation

13:35.440 --> 13:37.192
There's no negotiation

13:37.276 --> 13:39.361
With the fellas
at the freakin' FCC

13:42.614 --> 13:44.867
They're as stuffy
as the stuffiest

13:44.950 --> 13:46.285
Of special-interest groups

13:46.368 --> 13:48.287
Make a joke
about your bowels

13:48.370 --> 13:49.997
And they order in
the troops

13:50.080 --> 13:51.874
Any baby with a brain

13:51.957 --> 13:53.458
Could tell them
everybody poops

13:53.542 --> 13:55.878
Take a tip, take a lesson

13:55.961 --> 13:57.504
You'll never win
by messing

13:57.588 --> 14:00.924
-(toilet flushing)
-With the fellows at the freakin' FCC

14:01.008 --> 14:02.843
And if you find yourself

14:02.926 --> 14:06.471
With some young,
sexy thing

14:08.223 --> 14:10.851
You're gonna
have to do her

14:10.934 --> 14:12.811
With your ding-a-ling

14:12.895 --> 14:14.271
(screams)

14:14.354 --> 14:15.564
'Cause you can't
say penis

14:15.647 --> 14:17.566
So they sent
this little warning

14:17.649 --> 14:19.568
They're prepared
to do their worst

14:19.651 --> 14:21.361
And they stuck it
in your mailbox

14:21.445 --> 14:23.113
Hoping you could
be coerced

14:23.197 --> 14:25.407
I can think of quite
another place

14:25.490 --> 14:27.075
They should've
stuck it first

14:27.159 --> 14:29.119
They may just be neurotic

14:29.203 --> 14:30.579
Or possibly psychotic

14:30.662 --> 14:36.043
They're the fellows
at the freakin' FCC

14:38.837 --> 14:39.922
(clapping)

14:40.005 --> 14:42.257
Mr. Griffin,
that was terrific.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.051
But I'm here to tell you,
that as of today,

14:44.134 --> 14:46.094
PTV is officially
shut down.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.930
Shut me down, huh?

14:48.013 --> 14:49.640
Well, you'll have to
catch me first.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.434
Ah! Ah! Ah!

14:52.518 --> 14:54.019
Ah! Ah! Ah!

14:54.102 --> 14:55.979
Ah! Ow! Ah!

14:56.063 --> 14:57.606
Ah! Ah! Ah!

14:57.689 --> 14:59.942
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

15:00.025 --> 15:01.360
Ah! Ah! Ah!

15:02.694 --> 15:04.238
All right, you caught me.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.990
We're tired of you
infecting people with your smut.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.326
This is an epidemic.
And it must be contained.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.412
Well, Mr. FCC,
you can stop PTV,

15:12.496 --> 15:15.415
but you can never
stop people from being who they are!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.168
Or can we?

15:20.879 --> 15:21.964
(screams)

15:22.047 --> 15:24.758
What are you doing?
Censoring real life.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.134
His chin
looks like balls.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.469
You want me
to cover that, too?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.601
How long are you guys
gonna be censoring us?

15:34.685 --> 15:37.771
Until you and all of Quahog
start to clean up your act.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.983
Like Ozzy Osbourne
when he stopped biting the heads off bats.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.276
(crowd cheering)

15:42.359 --> 15:44.069
Before I start playing,

15:44.152 --> 15:46.655
I'm gonna eat
this whole sandwich.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.407
(crowd cheering)

16:01.295 --> 16:02.880
I'll finish it later.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.047
Yay!

16:04.131 --> 16:05.841
Lois, these eggs
are scrambled.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.511
I thought for sure
you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.

16:09.595 --> 16:10.596
(snickers)

16:10.679 --> 16:12.431
Brian, stop writing
jokes for Peter.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.308
And, Peter,
you brought this on yourself

16:14.391 --> 16:16.101
by putting on
those filthy shows.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.811
Oh, Lois, you are so
full of...

16:17.895 --> 16:18.896
(horn blares)

16:18.979 --> 16:20.022
What?

16:20.105 --> 16:22.482
-Now I can't say... in my own... house?
- (horn blares)

16:22.566 --> 16:23.567
(horn blares)

16:23.650 --> 16:25.152
-Great, Lois. Just... great.
- (horn blares)

16:25.235 --> 16:28.197
You know, you're lucky you're good at...
my... or I'd never put up with you.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.489
You know what
I'm talking about.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.533
-When you... lubed up... toothpaste
- (horn blares)

16:31.617 --> 16:35.579
in my... cherry...
Episcopalian... extension cord...

16:35.662 --> 16:37.789
-wetness... with a parking ticket.
- (horn blares)

16:37.873 --> 16:39.499
That is the best.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.796
What the hell is this?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.132
The FCC has forbidden
audible flatulence.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.510
Everyone is now required
to wear this device

16:49.593 --> 16:52.137
that converts all fart sounds
into Steven Wright jokes.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.641
DEVICE: I spilled spot remover
on my dog. Now he's gone.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.975
Oh, this is bogus!

17:00.479 --> 17:02.481
Two shakes, that's it.
Move along.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.983
Oh. Why, thank you,
tinkle fairy.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.196
Lois, you ruined everything,
you know that?

17:09.279 --> 17:11.114
Peter, I know it's
a little extreme.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.699
But when it comes
to our children,

17:12.783 --> 17:15.369
it's better to err
on the safe side. Isn't that right?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.539
No. You know, Lois,
if everybody was as closed-minded as you,

17:18.622 --> 17:21.708
the world wouldn't
have some of its most inspired creations.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.505
Man, this chocolate bar
is delicious.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.884
Oh, yeah.
I love peanut butter.

17:30.968 --> 17:32.928
(tires screeching)

17:33.011 --> 17:34.763
(siren wails)

17:34.847 --> 17:37.140
I'm Officer Reeses.
What happened here?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.560
He got peanut butter
on my chocolate.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.646
He got chocolate
in my peanut butter.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.944
(two gunshots)

17:49.027 --> 17:50.571
Oh, come on.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.865
I know what'll
make you feel better.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.992
How about a little
angry sex, huh?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.243
Oh, all right.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.703
(horn blares)

17:57.786 --> 17:59.913
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Those actions are highly inappropriate.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.833
What? Wait a minute.
We're not allowed to have sex?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.001
Oh, you can have sex.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.919
Just no moaning,
no tongue-kissing,

18:06.003 --> 18:08.213
no thrusting,
no movement whatsoever.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.427
Well, this isn't
very romantic.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.845
I mean, how are we
supposed to--

18:14.928 --> 18:16.388
I'm done. Night, Lois.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.764
(snoring)

18:20.851 --> 18:22.186
(grunting) Oh.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.271
-Come on, you son of a...
-(horn blares)

18:25.355 --> 18:27.649
-Oh... me.
-(horn blares)

18:27.733 --> 18:28.859
Brian, would you mind?

18:28.942 --> 18:29.943
(groans) Yeah, sure.

18:30.027 --> 18:31.278
Oh, sorry.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.030
I haven't had sex
in two weeks.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.781
I'm just a little
on edge lately.

18:34.865 --> 18:38.368
(scoffs) A little? There wasn't this much
tension when the slaves were freed.

18:38.452 --> 18:41.371
Uh, okay, so, uh,
you're free to go.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.998
But we're cool, right?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.833
(sighs) Peter,
we have to talk.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.753
Look, I thought this FCC thing
was a good idea at first,

18:47.836 --> 18:49.546
but it's-- it's just
gone way too far.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.798
What, uh, are you
saying, Lois?

18:51.882 --> 18:52.966
Well,

18:53.050 --> 18:55.511
I don't want to admit it,
but I think you were right.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.388
I don't believe it!
Finally I can do this!

18:58.472 --> 19:00.349
(fanfare playing)

19:00.432 --> 19:02.893
I set that thing up
15 years ago.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.311
Hey, where's the clown?

19:04.394 --> 19:07.397
We've got to do something about this.
Pack your bag, Peter.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.316
We're going to Washington.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.235
Oh, there he is.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.029
Are we there yet?

19:14.112 --> 19:15.280
No, Chris,
honey, we're not.

19:15.364 --> 19:16.573
Are we there yet?

19:16.657 --> 19:17.699
No, Chris.

19:17.783 --> 19:18.784
Are we there yet?

19:18.909 --> 19:20.661
Yes, Chris, yes.
Okay? We're there.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.745
Liar!

19:21.912 --> 19:22.913
East of Eden?

19:22.996 --> 19:26.041
So you--you pretty much
do whatever Oprah tells you to, huh?

19:26.124 --> 19:29.336
You know, this book's
been around for 50 years. It's a classic.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.587
But you just
got it last week,

19:30.671 --> 19:32.798
and there's a giant
Oprah sticker on the front.

19:32.881 --> 19:33.966
Oh, oh, is that
what that is?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.175
Let me just peel
that right off.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.052
So, uh, what are you
gonna read after that one?

19:37.135 --> 19:38.804
Well, she hasn't
told us yet. Damn!

19:41.515 --> 19:43.016
And the motion carries.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.602
The janitor's
new nickname is Sweepy.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.687
(crowd chattering)

19:46.770 --> 19:48.689
(fart resonating)

19:56.071 --> 19:58.407
Gentlemen,
that was a fart.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.950
What's going on out here?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.285
I'll tell you
what's going on.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.287
This government's FCC

20:03.370 --> 20:05.372
is trying to take
all the farts away from television!

20:05.455 --> 20:08.041
And all the sex,
and all the nudity, and all the poop.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.626
Well, I say it's wrong.

20:09.710 --> 20:12.379
These things are
part of the fabric of American life.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.131
Well, we appreciate
your passion

20:14.214 --> 20:16.300
but this Congress
supports the FCC.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.135
Indecency is un-American.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.428
Oh, yeah?

20:19.511 --> 20:21.680
Well, I can prove to you
that that's a bunch of bull.

20:21.763 --> 20:22.890
Look around you.

20:22.973 --> 20:23.974
The Washington Monument.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.560
Looks an awful lot
like a penis, doesn't it?

20:26.643 --> 20:30.189
The Capitol Building,
quite obviously a giant boob.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.940
And the Pentagon?

20:32.024 --> 20:35.527
Well, you look me in the eye and tell me
it doesn't look like a big anus.

20:35.611 --> 20:38.947
My God! How could we
have been so blind?

20:39.031 --> 20:40.324
He's absolutely right.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.910
Come to think of it, have you ever looked
closely at the Lincoln Memorial?

20:46.413 --> 20:51.293
Our top story, the FCC's content ban
on Quahog has finally been lifted.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.546
Well, you did it, Peter.
You beat the FCC.

20:54.630 --> 20:58.050
(shushing) Lois, Lois,
let's watch The Brady Bunch.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.676
Look what I did, everybody.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.180
Isn't it the biggest,
most super-special poop you've ever seen?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.765
(giggles)

21:04.848 --> 21:08.185
Well, Cindy, I guess it's true
that big things come in small packages.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.853
(all laughing)

21:19.321 --> 21:21.532
(theme song playing)
