<i><font color=#ca> ~ Fora Temer ~ </font></i>

00:03.270 --> 00:07.590
<i>Doctor, it's my son.
There was an accident. I ...</i>

00:07.658 --> 00:10.827
<i>- I know what we have to do. Nurse!
- Yes, doctor?</i>

00:10.895 --> 00:14.564
<i>Prep the patient for emergency
surgery. We're gonna go...</i>

00:14.632 --> 00:19.335
<i> - under the knife.
- Ugh! This show is so good!</i>

00:19.437 --> 00:23.873
Thank you so much for letting me
watch "Under the knife" here, Steven.

00:23.974 --> 00:27.877
- How come you can't watch the show at home?
- My mom says this doesn't

00:27.978 --> 00:30.100
represent a real emergency room.

00:30.101 --> 00:33.283
<i>How did his legs...
get into... his brain?!</i>

00:33.350 --> 00:36.419
She just doesn't
understand that it's satire.

00:36.487 --> 00:42.225
- Is that your phone?
- It's probably my mom. Called it.

00:43.511 --> 00:47.163
Hi, mother. It's Connie.
Mm-hmm. Yes, ma'am.

00:47.231 --> 00:51.167
I'm at the home of
Steven Universe. Mm-hmm.

00:51.235 --> 00:54.704
Yes, ma'am. We're ...
we're just hanging out.

00:54.705 --> 00:57.903
Oh. Steven's parents.
They're, uh ...

00:57.938 --> 01:01.177
they're in the other room.
You would like to talk to

01:01.245 --> 01:03.713
Steven's mom?
Oh, okay. Hold on a moment.

01:03.781 --> 01:06.032
That's gonna be
pretty hard since my mom

01:06.033 --> 01:08.284
gave up her physical form to make me.

01:08.352 --> 01:10.153
I can't tell her that.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.955
Garnet, quick ... you have to pretend

01:12.022 --> 01:16.626
- to be my mom to Connie's mom.
- Hello.

01:16.694 --> 01:18.949
This... is mom Universe.

01:18.950 --> 01:22.332
Yes. The children are playing swords.

01:22.399 --> 01:25.979
Sorry ... playing with
swords. They're bleeding.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.770
Oh, no. They are dead.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.385
Don't call again.

01:29.606 --> 01:33.400
Sorry. I panicked.

01:33.878 --> 01:36.746
<i>What do you mean,
your mom won't let you come over?</i>

01:36.814 --> 01:39.256
It's the midseason pre-finale
of "Under the knife"!

01:39.257 --> 01:40.884
Steven, my parents are really upset.

01:40.951 --> 01:44.787
They say the will not let me
see you again until they meet

01:44.889 --> 01:48.358
- both of your parents in person.
- But that's impossible!

01:48.425 --> 01:52.095
I know, but they want both
of our families to go out

01:52.096 --> 01:55.765
- together for dinner.
- It sounds so... adult.

01:55.766 --> 01:59.469
I wonder if Fish Stew pizza
will take reservations for ...

01:59.537 --> 02:03.673
- Pearl, Garnet, dad, Amethyst ... all eight of us.
- You can't bring everybody!

02:03.741 --> 02:08.443
- Why not?
- Because ... because... I told my parents

02:08.512 --> 02:12.415
- you have a nuclear family.
- Nuclear?! Sure, they make stuff blow up

02:12.483 --> 02:16.397
sometimes, but that's because
they're magic, not radioactive!

02:16.398 --> 02:18.354
Steven, "nuclear" means two adults

02:18.455 --> 02:23.393
and their child and/or children.
My parents think you live with

02:23.460 --> 02:27.397
- your mother and father.
- But none of that is true.

02:27.464 --> 02:30.822
You never told your mom and
dad about the Crystal Gems?

02:30.823 --> 02:32.502
No, and it has to stay that way.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.778
<i>If they find out I lied to them,
they'll never let me </i>

02:35.845 --> 02:40.075
<i>hang out with you again.</i>

02:40.711 --> 02:43.928
How am I supposed to choose
just one of you to bring to dinner?

02:43.982 --> 02:47.695
- You're all so... cool!
- Why does it have to be dinner?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.222
We get all the energy
we need from our gems,

02:50.321 --> 02:53.255
and while our human constructs
are capable of eating,

02:53.288 --> 02:57.460
- I find it very uncomfortable.
- I love eating!

02:57.528 --> 03:00.729
Feels weird.

03:01.565 --> 03:03.967
Okay, okay, okay. Let's focus.

03:03.968 --> 03:07.804
Which of you would make the
best and most nuclear mom?

03:07.805 --> 03:11.641
Garnet, you keep us safe by
scaring off the bad guys,

03:11.709 --> 03:13.750
just like a mom would.

03:13.751 --> 03:16.813
But you're not the
best conversationalist.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.718
Amethyst, you would be a
superfun mom!

03:21.785 --> 03:25.144
- Can moms be gross?
- Why not?

03:25.145 --> 03:28.286
Pearl! You're
always worried about me, you

03:28.287 --> 03:31.427
teach me lots of stuff, you're
approachable, and you're,

03:31.528 --> 03:36.299
- like, totally not gross.
- Uh...

03:36.367 --> 03:37.823
But you can't eat dinner.

03:37.824 --> 03:42.032
Man, why did Connie
have to say I have one

03:42.067 --> 03:46.309
- mother instead of zero... or three?
- We'll figure this thing out.

03:46.377 --> 03:48.648
We just have to put our heads together.

03:48.782 --> 03:50.874
Why didn't I
think of this before?

03:50.982 --> 03:54.788
It's so obvious! You can
all come to dinner ...

03:54.794 --> 03:58.388
- all three of you, fused into one!
- What?!

03:58.489 --> 04:00.173
- Whoa!
- What?

04:00.174 --> 04:04.174
Steven, you know we
only fuse in deadly situations!

04:04.175 --> 04:07.497
It'd be like ... like I'm
actually bringing my whole family!

04:07.564 --> 04:10.867
- That's insane.
- Fusion is serious magic,

04:10.934 --> 04:14.404
- not a trick for dinner parties.
- I know.

04:14.471 --> 04:18.774
Then I guess this is it.
I'll never get to see Connie again.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.945
Oh, Connie! I'll never know a
star that shines as bright as you.

04:24.637 --> 04:27.884
We have no choice.

04:31.459 --> 04:35.593
We've been waiting for nearly
20 minutes.

- Uh... oh.
- Hi, Connie!

04:47.588 --> 04:51.074
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Maheswaran!

04:51.175 --> 04:56.145
- Thanks... honeybuns.
- You're welcome... Greg.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.514
I'm Greg Universe.

04:57.515 --> 05:02.281
And this massive drink of
water is my wife, Alexandrite.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.115
Hi-i-i-i-i-i.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.097
I hope this place has
unlimited breadsticks.

05:14.164 --> 05:16.833
Don't be rude.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.159
Bleh.

05:18.160 --> 05:23.044
Isn't my wife a riot?

05:23.079 --> 05:26.542
So, tell me ... how did you two meet?

05:26.610 --> 05:32.822
- Huh? How did we meet? Well, we, um ...
- They met on a roller coaster!

05:34.043 --> 05:38.488
- She was too tall to ride!
- Uh...

05:38.489 --> 05:45.686
I remember it like it was
yesterday. Right, honey?

05:46.814 --> 05:52.502
- Eh... sorry.
- Have some more breadsticks... dear.

05:53.769 --> 05:58.841
What is it that you two do
for a living, Mr. and Mrs. Universe?

05:58.909 --> 06:03.546
Well, you see, I own a local car
wash, and my sweet, dear wife here ...

06:03.614 --> 06:09.194
My mom works on an apple farm!

06:09.229 --> 06:13.990
- What did we say about heads on the table?
- She uses all her arms

06:14.057 --> 06:16.826
to pick apples out of huge trees.

06:16.894 --> 06:21.731
Well, you know what they say ...
an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.460
- Yes. I hate doctors.
- Well, I'm a doctor.

06:24.461 --> 06:27.317
Steven, help me find the restroom!

06:27.318 --> 06:30.173
Things are going
pretty good so far, huh?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.121
Steven, are you kidding me?!

06:32.122 --> 06:34.944
What is this thing that
you brought to dinner?!

06:35.012 --> 06:38.431
It ... it's my family.
It's all the gems

06:38.432 --> 06:42.621
fused together into a
six-armed, giant woman.

06:42.656 --> 06:46.566
- Why couldn't you just bring one of the gems?
- 'Cause that would

06:46.651 --> 06:51.478
- be a lie. Your glasses.
- What about them?

06:51.513 --> 06:55.298
I healed your eyes. You
don't even need to wear those anymore.

06:55.365 --> 06:59.440
- What are you talking about?
- All that stuff you told your parents

06:59.475 --> 07:03.306
- about my family ... you're just ashamed of me!
- Oh, whatever, Steven.

07:03.373 --> 07:07.108
Let's just focus on
getting through the evening.

07:07.578 --> 07:11.477
<i>So, Steven was telling
me that on his mom's apple</i>

07:11.478 --> 07:15.377
<i>farm, they're bioengineering
a gala-fuji hybrid.</i>

07:15.445 --> 07:18.480
- Definitely true.
- Isn't that right, Mrs. Universe?

07:18.548 --> 07:23.218
Ugh! What are you doing?

07:23.286 --> 07:27.656
- I'm hungry!
- I don't think so. Cut it out, you two.

07:33.429 --> 07:36.896
Stop! You don't have to eat it!

07:42.724 --> 07:45.599
Steven!
Ohh. Thank you so much.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.559
You don't know how horrified

07:47.560 --> 07:51.480
it was when that dreck
nearly fell into our mouths.

07:51.547 --> 07:54.783
Eating food is so
disgusting! You chew it into

07:54.784 --> 07:58.020
nasty mush, swallow
that goop, and it comes

07:58.087 --> 08:01.556
out of you? What a
completely horrid experience!

08:01.657 --> 08:04.603
Uh, speak for yourself.
Ha! I love it when mush

08:04.635 --> 08:08.361
- passes through my body.
- It doesn't matter what you two think.

08:08.428 --> 08:11.056
We're doing this for Steven!

08:11.091 --> 08:13.268
What is going on here?

08:13.336 --> 08:15.521
- Who are they?!
- I knew I should have trusted

08:15.522 --> 08:19.350
my bad feelings about
this new friend of yours, but

08:19.351 --> 08:23.178
I never thought I wouldn't be
able to trust my own daughter.

08:23.246 --> 08:24.980
<i>Connie!</i>

08:24.981 --> 08:27.582
Connie.

08:27.650 --> 08:32.453
Steven, I'm so sorry.
It's not that I'm ashamed of you.

08:32.522 --> 08:36.224
I was so worried that my parents would
think all this magic stuff is weird.

08:36.292 --> 08:39.361
What if they don't let me hang
out with you anymore?

08:39.429 --> 08:41.563
I-I'm sorry I messed everything up.

08:41.563 --> 08:45.008
I wish there was a way we could
just hang out without

08:45.043 --> 08:48.303
- having to worry about stuff.
- Steven, let's just hop on a bus

08:48.371 --> 08:54.099
- and live somewhere else without telling anyone!
- That's a great idea!

08:58.347 --> 09:02.517
- Where's this bus taking us?
- Wherever we end up.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.638
We'll find a way to survive. I've
been reading about sustainable living.

09:05.730 --> 09:09.757
- Maybe it'll take us to a real apple farm!
- What's up with you

09:09.772 --> 09:12.494
- and apples today?
- Huh?

09:15.965 --> 09:19.977
Steve-e-e-n!

09:20.773 --> 09:24.365
You two, come
out of that bus, this instant!

09:24.366 --> 09:29.039
Okay!
J-just put the bus down first.

09:29.348 --> 09:30.829
I don't even know where to begin

09:30.830 --> 09:33.051
- with you, young la...
- What were you thinking,

09:33.152 --> 09:35.782
running off with Connie like that?
You could have gotten

09:35.899 --> 09:38.739
- yourselves hurt!
- Or gotten mangled in traffic.

09:38.759 --> 09:42.094
- Or thrown in prison.
- Steven, you are in very big trouble,

09:42.161 --> 09:45.512
- and we have no choice but to punish you.
- But...

09:45.530 --> 09:50.102
- No dinner for 1,000 years.
- 1,000?

09:50.225 --> 09:52.476
We would never starve you,

09:52.486 --> 09:56.664
but you will lose your TV
privileges... for 1,000 years.

09:56.742 --> 10:00.976
No! The midseason
pre-finale of "Under the knife"!

10:01.022 --> 10:04.073
How can you do this to me?!

10:04.177 --> 10:07.514
Because we love you, Steven.

10:07.761 --> 10:12.163
Wow. That was a masterful use of
the "because we love you" shutdown.

10:12.267 --> 10:15.596
I'm quite partial to the
"it's for your own good" myself.

10:15.597 --> 10:20.352
That "1,000 years of no dinner" bit...
was pretty funny.

10:20.380 --> 10:24.042
All comedy is derived from fear.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.692
- You are too much.
- I did not know what to make

10:27.693 --> 10:29.988
of the two of ...
excuse me ... four of you,

10:30.056 --> 10:33.431
but I see that you are
responsible parents ...

10:33.496 --> 10:35.763
uh, caregivers? Guardians.

10:35.764 --> 10:39.164
So, I can still hang out with Steven?

10:39.265 --> 10:42.763
- Sure.
- All right!

10:44.070 --> 10:46.891
Uh...
