WEBVTT

00:01.503 --> 00:04.089
Okay. Bye.

00:08.593 --> 00:11.513
Everyone, stop what you're doing.
I have terrible news.

00:12.305 --> 00:13.556
Dwight is
no longer with us.

00:13.890 --> 00:14.891
What?
What?

00:15.308 --> 00:16.851
He's gone, damn it.

00:18.937 --> 00:21.356
He's been promoted to
V.P. of Sabre Retail

00:21.439 --> 00:22.732
and he's staying
in Florida forever.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.527
So, he's alive?

00:25.777 --> 00:29.030
Yeah. That was him on the phone.
He sounds wonderful.

00:29.239 --> 00:31.616
Well, the way you said it made
it sound like he was dead.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.785
How could I have
been more clear?

00:33.868 --> 00:36.246
He had a massive
stroke of good fortune

00:36.329 --> 00:38.456
and he is now in
a better place.

00:38.707 --> 00:41.459
If Dwight's not coming back, does
that mean we can open his treasure?

00:42.335 --> 00:45.672
You guys, we've gone over
this, there is no treasure.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.590
When the team
left for Tallahassee,

00:47.674 --> 00:50.260
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.095
Don't touch my treasure.

00:52.679 --> 00:53.888
Okay? You understand?

00:54.264 --> 00:56.808
Obviously he wants us to obsess about it.
There's nothing in there.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.271
Which is obviously what he
would want us to think,

01:01.354 --> 01:03.982
making it the perfect
place to hide a treasure.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.026
Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn
in The Princess Bride.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.320
I think that Dwight
wanted us to realize

01:09.404 --> 01:12.782
that this conversation among
friends is the true treasure.

01:13.575 --> 01:14.576
No,no,no.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.328
I am dying to
know what's in there.

01:17.412 --> 01:20.248
Yeah, I know, Oscar. We all are.
But nobody's going to open it.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.541
You'd have to be insane.

01:24.544 --> 01:25.545
Hi. Hello.

01:28.339 --> 01:31.384
Now carefully open the box.

01:35.847 --> 01:37.640
It's a photo of all of us.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.019
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.774
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

01:45.857 --> 01:49.569
Who would put a poison dart... Well, I
mean, I don't know that it's poisoned.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.071
I mean,
I just have to imagine.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.616
God, I'm glad
he's okay though.

01:54.699 --> 01:55.992
Kind of sounds
like he deserved it,

01:56.075 --> 01:58.578
opening another man's
treasure and all. Wow!

02:20.350 --> 02:25.021
Well, Mister Ball, it's been a pleasure.
Now, give my regards to hell!

02:26.898 --> 02:30.527
All right!
Well swung by VIPVP.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.404
I am loving the chemistry
between you two.

02:33.488 --> 02:36.324
I am so happy Dwight is going
to be working alongside me.

02:36.407 --> 02:40.286
We are a regular Archibald
and his man, George.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.497
I bet. I'm excited.

02:42.831 --> 02:46.668
Trick! There's no such thing.
It's not even a real English duo.

02:46.751 --> 02:47.752
Ah!

02:47.877 --> 02:52.715
I just made you look like the Goat of Dover.
And that doesn't exist either.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.636
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

02:57.428 --> 02:58.429
Pong!

02:59.097 --> 03:02.100
Oh, that reminds me... Little
something from all of us.

03:02.642 --> 03:05.562
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Jim.
That's so thoughtful.

03:10.775 --> 03:13.862
Fore! Oh, yeah!

03:14.112 --> 03:15.989
He doesn't even care.

03:16.281 --> 03:17.282
I don't even care!

03:17.866 --> 03:19.450
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.203
It's a weird feeling.
It's, um...

03:23.788 --> 03:27.458
What's the word?
It's not "bittersweet."

03:28.251 --> 03:30.253
It's "sweet." Yeah.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.506
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.049
You want
the same as last year?

03:35.216 --> 03:37.176
Would if I could
and I can so I will.

03:37.260 --> 03:40.805
Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is.
Dealer's choice.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.057
I'll put you down
for shortbreads.

03:43.308 --> 03:44.559
Damn it.

03:45.143 --> 03:47.186
Knock, knock. Hey.

03:47.353 --> 03:48.646
It's Sasha's
first year in the troop

03:48.730 --> 03:49.981
so I'm selling
cookies for her.

03:50.315 --> 03:51.357
Anyway, would you
like some?

03:51.482 --> 03:53.651
No. No.
What?

03:54.193 --> 03:56.487
I've been selling here for five years.
This is my spot.

03:56.988 --> 04:00.783
You can't claim territories. This is
the only place I interact with people.

04:01.117 --> 04:04.162
Why can't you sell it
at your church or barbershop?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.333
Or chess club?

04:09.042 --> 04:12.462
You know what? It's your first
time, we'll split the office.

04:13.296 --> 04:17.091
You can have Sales, the Annex,
Creed, and I don't know.

04:17.175 --> 04:19.302
I'll just take Accounting.

04:19.761 --> 04:23.514
That's it?
Yeah. Well, okay.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.892
Thanks, Darryl.
Okay, great.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.020
All I need is Kevin.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.481
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined.

04:31.564 --> 04:32.774
And then some.

04:32.982 --> 04:36.027
When I first started selling cookies,
he was a relatively thin man.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.739
Not a thin man, mind you.
Relatively thin.

04:41.366 --> 04:44.744
Hey, Lucy, I'm home!
Babaloo.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.245
Here, let me help.

04:46.537 --> 04:51.000
I got it. It was so busy at the store today.
Really good cheese nibbles.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.126
I had like a hundred.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.128
Irene hired me as
her live-in helper.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.047
We met at
the store launch.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.800
<i>I told her I was moving here
and I needed</i> a <i>place</i>

04:58.883 --> 05:00.551
and it just
sort of made sense.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.261
I basically do
everything for her.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.681
I run errands, I do
chores around the house.

05:04.806 --> 05:06.099
I cook and clean.

05:06.391 --> 05:08.893
Honestly, I don't know
how she survived without me.

05:09.519 --> 05:14.691
When can I introduce you to my grandson?
He's a wonderful swimmer.

05:14.774 --> 05:17.485
Shallow end, deep end.
He does it all.

05:17.568 --> 05:19.988
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.656
I have to talk to
my old boss, Andy,

05:21.739 --> 05:23.241
and tell him I'm
staying in Florida.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.082
Oh! What kind
of tea is this?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.917
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.923
Oh!
Oh!

05:40.258 --> 05:44.262
In England, they put the holes a
little bit to the right, you see.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.930
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.140
If I may.

05:48.307 --> 05:54.397
Try holding the putter, you
know, with your wrists here,

05:54.689 --> 05:56.733
and your thumbs here.

05:57.275 --> 05:58.276
Oh.

05:58.443 --> 06:00.987
That's right.
Your little finger.

06:02.113 --> 06:03.448
Would you like to
buy some cookies?

06:04.991 --> 06:06.325
Cookies, eh?

06:06.451 --> 06:07.618
Mmm-hmm.
Hmm.

06:07.869 --> 06:11.039
Oh, the spring time
thinks that it's the best

06:11.122 --> 06:13.916
And fall time
thinks that it's the best

06:14.000 --> 06:16.711
Cold time has
kind of a strut

06:16.794 --> 06:19.672
And Valentine's
thinks that it's the best

06:19.756 --> 06:22.550
But gather round, peeps
I'll tell you the truth

06:22.633 --> 06:25.428
Nothing beats the cookie
season That's the truth

06:30.808 --> 06:32.560
It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev.

06:32.769 --> 06:35.521
I know. But sometimes you
still get a little something.

06:35.813 --> 06:38.066
Hey, you tricked me.
You just wanted Kevin.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.735
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.111
See you next year, sport.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.156
No, no, no, that's not fair. What if
Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?

06:45.281 --> 06:46.699
I do.
See?

06:46.824 --> 06:50.411
That doesn't mean anything. Kevin,
do you want to buy cookies from me?

06:50.495 --> 06:52.080
Oh, I definitely do.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.040
Huh. Hit the road, Jack.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.958
No, you hit the road, Jack.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.837
Hey, guys, come on.
Don't fight over me.

07:00.338 --> 07:02.006
Why don't we split the order?
It's only fair.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.134
No, wait, no. I'm buying.
I make the rules.

07:05.218 --> 07:08.054
I actually do want
you to fight over me.

07:08.137 --> 07:12.433
I want to be wined and
dined and sixty-nined.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.810
Ugh!

07:14.852 --> 07:18.940
Metaphorically sixty-nined.
Ew! Perverts.

07:20.191 --> 07:21.400
No offense, Oscar.

07:23.611 --> 07:27.198
Hop in! We have places to be!
No rest for the wicked.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.285
All right,
so I guess this is it.

07:31.869 --> 07:35.039
Well, Jim, I just want to say that
we haven't always gotten along.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.291
And, at times, I've even
hated your guts, but...

07:41.379 --> 07:42.880
Bye, bye. I win.

07:44.966 --> 07:45.967
Good-bye, Dwight.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.387
Robert! Race you to the clubhouse!
Gentleman's bet!

07:49.554 --> 07:50.721
Whoo-hoo!

07:56.018 --> 07:58.187
Well, he's
Florida's problem now.

07:58.688 --> 08:00.523
Oh, let Dwight
have his fun.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.775
Today will not be his day.

08:02.859 --> 08:03.943
What's that?

08:04.068 --> 08:05.486
I'm going to
tank the Sabre store

08:05.570 --> 08:06.821
at the presentation
to the board.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.156
I thought you
liked the store.

08:08.239 --> 08:10.324
No, the store is lovely.

08:10.408 --> 08:14.704
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line.

08:14.787 --> 08:16.247
Great job. Cheers.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.583
Thank you.

08:19.584 --> 08:24.338
But there's a reason we sell our
products online and over the phone.

08:25.256 --> 08:27.258
Have you ever used
Sabre electronics, Jim?

08:27.592 --> 08:29.552
They're cheap,
they're unintuitive.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.179
The Sabre store
would work

08:31.262 --> 08:32.805
if we adopted
the carnival model

08:32.889 --> 08:34.765
of leaving town once
everyone's wise to us.

08:35.558 --> 08:38.936
Wow. When you put it that way, I
guess it does sound pretty terrible.

08:39.312 --> 08:42.940
I couldn't just kill the project from the start.
Jo Bennett endorsed it.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.526
Shame, though.
I did like Dwight.

08:46.444 --> 08:51.115
Robert, I'm going to win! Ha-ha!
I'm the gentleman! Suck it!

08:51.240 --> 08:53.576
Bravo, Dwight!
Very good!

08:56.120 --> 08:57.121
Shame.

08:59.457 --> 09:00.958
The math is simple, folks!

09:01.125 --> 09:05.838
Deeper market penetration plus greater
visibility will raise Sabre...

09:06.797 --> 09:08.841
To the power of two.
To the power of two.

09:11.302 --> 09:12.261
How did that look?

09:12.345 --> 09:13.346
I'm not just
saying this,

09:13.763 --> 09:15.765
that was the best
thing I've ever seen.

09:16.641 --> 09:17.642
Told you.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.852
When you guys do that whole
"power of two" shebang,

09:20.311 --> 09:21.771
how about I pop up also?

09:21.979 --> 09:24.774
I guess we'd have to
say "power of three."

09:24.857 --> 09:27.818
Actually you know what?
Yeah, that actually works.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.570
You'd spin off right,
I'd spin off...

09:29.654 --> 09:31.030
You know what?
That is a great idea.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.531
Cathy, write that down
and print it out.

09:32.615 --> 09:33.908
It's going to make some
really good toilet paper.

09:34.325 --> 09:35.785
All right.
There he is.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.495
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

09:37.662 --> 09:39.163
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

09:39.497 --> 09:41.666
What? Your stylist
ran out of messy spray?

09:43.334 --> 09:45.920
Um, actually, it's for your own good.
I think we should...

09:46.003 --> 09:47.255
You want to do
something for my own good?

09:47.338 --> 09:48.589
Turn around,
walk out that door.

09:48.673 --> 09:49.924
Do not stop until
you get to Scranton.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.677
Find my cell phone charger, mail
it back to me and then go to hell.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.892
Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell
you, you look like Wooly Willy?

10:00.810 --> 10:01.811
Silence.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.562
I'm just trying to...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.273
I know what
you're trying to do.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.024
I don't want it.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.653
But your face does look like
the guy from Operation.

10:12.697 --> 10:15.074
It's the same guy.
That's the joke I made.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.534
Different guy.
You know what...

10:16.701 --> 10:17.702
I just think
you should know...

10:17.785 --> 10:20.037
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit.

10:23.624 --> 10:27.586
Well, I tried. You saw it.
So, it's on the record.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.088
I have a plane to catch.

10:30.089 --> 10:33.634
Can you help me? I'm trying to
make a video chat with Andy.

10:33.718 --> 10:35.970
Just open the program
and type in his username.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.471
Can you just do it?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.061
You type in your password.

10:44.729 --> 10:47.023
Erin, one, two, three.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.150
That's a terrible password.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.818
And you don't
make a video chat.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.069
You video chat.
All right.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.076
Hello.

10:59.410 --> 11:01.537
That's so weird. There's
something wrong with my laptop.

11:02.747 --> 11:03.831
Oh.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.915
I fixed it.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.754
Now mine's broken.
Hang on.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.176
Oh, there we go.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.847
He said "I did like Dwight"?
He's going to fire him.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.307
No,no,no,
I think it was more like,

11:21.390 --> 11:23.142
"I liked him,
but I don't anymore

11:23.225 --> 11:25.686
"because he did a bad job, so I'm
definitely going to yell at him."

11:25.770 --> 11:26.854
Robert doesn't
talk like that.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.439
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.483
I tried.
He will not listen.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.109
Did you actually
try your hardest?

11:32.193 --> 11:35.112
Yes. My pretty hardest.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.782
Look, you haven't dealt with
him in a while, all right?

11:37.865 --> 11:38.949
He's like Super Dwight.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.578
It's like he's been bitten by a
radioactive Dwight or something.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.746
Stanley, back me up.

11:43.829 --> 11:44.955
Don't talk to me.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.791
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida,

11:46.874 --> 11:48.250
but he would back me up.

11:48.334 --> 11:51.420
If Dwight's about to get
fired, you have to tell him.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.631
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.758
Okay. All right.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.261
What's a skinny guy like Toby
know about cookies?

11:59.345 --> 12:00.554
You can't trust
him to understand

12:00.638 --> 12:02.723
the wants and needs
of the thick man.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.308
Maybe Toby from
two years ago.

12:04.392 --> 12:05.726
Yeah.
That's true.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.978
If I have a question about
my cookies at midnight,

12:08.062 --> 12:09.313
who am I going to call?

12:09.688 --> 12:13.275
Darryl. Toby's probably
in bed with some model.

12:13.526 --> 12:14.527
Thank you.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.237
I'm not going to comment
on my personal life.

12:16.737 --> 12:20.449
Look, I need this. Okay, your
daughter is a pretty little girl.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.326
Let her go door to door.

12:22.410 --> 12:26.747
You think people are going to buy
cookies from my chubby daughter?

12:27.164 --> 12:28.165
Ooh.

12:28.874 --> 12:32.086
Baby, if you're watching this,
you're not chubby. You're beautiful.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.338
Daddy's just got to
sell some cookies.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.759
And we're also going to exercise more.
It's going to be fun.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.178
Oh. You know what you
have to do to decide?

12:41.262 --> 12:43.431
You need to make them do things
for you and buy you things.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.184
Or have them sing that song that
the frog does in Looney Tunes.

12:47.268 --> 12:48.727
Make them kiss each other.

12:49.437 --> 12:50.813
Make them kiss me.

12:51.772 --> 12:52.857
Ew!

12:55.025 --> 12:56.819
Yes, this is, too, tan.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.654
This right here.
No.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.948
This is a tan spot.

13:01.031 --> 13:04.660
I don't buy it. And that is a freckle.
That is not a tan, okay?

13:04.743 --> 13:07.204
I'm going to have to inspect it
in person when you get back here.

13:07.413 --> 13:11.667
I want you looking totally
PuertorriqueÃ±a when I see you.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.420
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back.

13:15.463 --> 13:16.464
What?

13:16.922 --> 13:19.758
I have a job here.
I work for an old lady.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.677
Hello.

13:22.928 --> 13:23.929
Andy?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.141
Yeah, that's awesome.
That's great.

13:28.559 --> 13:32.188
Oh, baby, telephone

13:32.271 --> 13:37.651
And tell me I'm your own

13:39.028 --> 13:40.988
Okay, this is tough
because Darryl,

13:41.071 --> 13:43.365
you sang better and
you danced better,

13:43.741 --> 13:46.952
but Toby has that indescribable
quality that makes a star.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.248
I think I've
reached my decision.

13:51.332 --> 13:56.045
I've decided that you guys are
going to keep doing things for me.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.964
No,no,no,no.
It's not worth it.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.174
No.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.593
No, it's not worth it?
That's too bad.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.262
Because I was feeling
particularly hungry this year.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.640
Yeah, okay, so what?
You buy 40 boxes?

14:08.307 --> 14:09.308
Hungrier

14:10.142 --> 14:11.143
50?

14:11.936 --> 14:13.187
Hungrier

14:13.604 --> 14:16.732
You're not
talking triple digits?

14:16.941 --> 14:18.984
Oh, yeah,
I'm talking triple digits.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.447
Again.

14:24.365 --> 14:26.700
Hello,
ma baby Hello, ma honey

14:26.784 --> 14:28.994
Hello, ma ragtime gal

14:30.829 --> 14:31.872
It's show time.

14:31.956 --> 14:32.957
Dwight!

14:33.082 --> 14:36.001
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing
you away, you keep flying back.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.586
You're like
an Amish return stick.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.213
Okay, great, listen, listen to me.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.631
No,no,no,no.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.132
Will you just let me
tell you one thing, please?

14:42.258 --> 14:43.676
Yes, you may tell me one thing.
Great.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.135
Wait, do you want to borrow money?
Listen to me.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.971
Robert is going to
veto the Sabre store.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.097
Jim, come on.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.890
Dwight, he's going to kill the store.
Mmm-hmm.

14:49.974 --> 14:52.142
And then I'm pretty sure
he's going to fire you for it.

14:52.643 --> 14:56.647
Wait, he's going to kill the
store and he's going to fire me?

14:56.814 --> 14:57.815
Yes.

14:58.190 --> 14:59.191
That's two things.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.901
Dwight, please.
Nice try, Jim.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.236
Your pranks have
never worked in the past

15:02.319 --> 15:03.737
and they're not
going to work today.

15:03.821 --> 15:04.947
Okay, first of all,
they've mostly worked so...

15:05.030 --> 15:06.740
You know what? You might
want to get to the airport.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.534
It's going to take you a long
time to get through security

15:08.617 --> 15:10.995
with all those beauty products.
Bye.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.496
Dwight, come on.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.083
Nothing is going to stop me.
That is the mark of a great man.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.043
Unstoppability.

15:18.127 --> 15:24.008
Dunder Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those
things vanish in my rear view mirror.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.762
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have a date with destiny.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.723
And from what I hear
she's a...

15:34.435 --> 15:36.645
Help! Help!

15:36.895 --> 15:40.316
Gross, don't lick my hand. God,
why is there so much saliva?

15:40.399 --> 15:41.609
All I had to do
was think about pie

15:41.692 --> 15:42.860
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.278
Gross! What? What? What?
What?

15:44.361 --> 15:46.572
Oh, God, Jim!
Oh! My appendix!

15:46.655 --> 15:47.698
I'm sorry.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.491
My wound hasn't healed yet.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.118
Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I forgot.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.078
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

15:57.333 --> 16:00.127
Where the hell is he?
I cannot do this without him.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.420
I don't know.
He's not picking up.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.800
Looks like
Shnoot's a no-show.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.803
Guess he wasn't vice
prezzy material after all.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.138
But I am.

16:11.472 --> 16:12.723
Put me in, babe.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.435
I've got the info down backwards,
forwards, and doggy style.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.561
I'm your man.

16:20.314 --> 16:21.565
Right.
Let's begin then.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.526
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce

16:24.610 --> 16:29.156
the vice president of Sabre
Retail, Mister Todd Packer.

16:30.574 --> 16:31.909
What's up?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.169
What are you doing?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.505
I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

16:44.588 --> 16:46.340
since apparently
she's not coming back

16:46.423 --> 16:47.633
and she didn't
bother to tell anyone.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.551
We knew.
Ryan told us.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.596
Ryan, why didn't you
tell me?

16:52.763 --> 16:53.972
Thought you
checked my Tumblr.

16:54.807 --> 16:55.933
You never update it.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.518
Well, I updated it.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.188
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

17:01.271 --> 17:03.440
Like, kind of
uncool, actually?

17:03.524 --> 17:04.817
To leave us without
a receptionist?

17:05.109 --> 17:06.860
We'll find
another receptionist.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.779
I mean, that's easy.
We'll be fine.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.869
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to...

17:15.953 --> 17:17.079
Get up. Get up.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.539
Okay. Okay.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.957
All right? I'm not
going to let you by.

17:20.082 --> 17:23.210
Then you know what? I'm going to
just have to run right through you.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.504
Okay.
What are you doing?

17:26.296 --> 17:27.965
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.134
Jackie Chan!

17:33.011 --> 17:34.430
Go.

17:34.513 --> 17:35.889
Hi, this is Alex.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.975
And this is Sam.

17:38.058 --> 17:42.146
"Kevin can't come to the phone right
now because he's busy with us."

17:42.438 --> 17:43.522
Perfect.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.191
Now people will think I'm
doing hot girls all day.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.652
I don't know, man. They might
think we're drag queens.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.363
Yeah, I don't know why you picked
names that were also guys' names.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.907
Okay, now who do I ride to
the kitchen like a pony?

17:54.116 --> 17:55.492
Don't make me be
your pony, Kevin.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.161
Forget it, man.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.164
What do you mean?
I'm out. So is Toby.

18:00.581 --> 18:02.291
This may be wrong,
but there's a limit

18:02.374 --> 18:04.042
to what I will do
for my child.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.003
Yeah.
I have my dignity, too.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.298
I refuse to be
another man's horsey.

18:10.048 --> 18:13.510
No, guys, stop! You have
to sell me cookies!

18:14.094 --> 18:15.471
I'll do anything.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.891
Hello, my
baby Hello, my honey

18:18.974 --> 18:20.434
I'm even going
to kiss Meredith.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.024
Mmm!

18:27.316 --> 18:29.193
That's so good.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.781
What are you doing?
No,no,no,no!

18:33.864 --> 18:35.991
This ends now!
This is dangerous.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.576
Thunder slam!

18:37.701 --> 18:39.203
No!

18:44.666 --> 18:46.210
Anything else you
need to talk about?

18:46.502 --> 18:48.295
Nope. That was it.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.597
Once again,
it's show time.

19:01.391 --> 19:06.146
What baffles me is how you could
take a perfectly good idea,

19:06.230 --> 19:09.566
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on

19:09.650 --> 19:12.402
and then, utterly
botch it in execution.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.738
If I may speak to that,

19:14.822 --> 19:16.573
I have only
been vice president

19:16.657 --> 19:18.325
of this project for
the last half-hour,

19:18.408 --> 19:20.577
so the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.538
I don't see Dwight.

19:22.621 --> 19:24.081
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

19:24.164 --> 19:27.417
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

19:27.918 --> 19:32.881
Whatever you do,
do not blame Todd Packer.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.425
It is not his fault.

19:36.093 --> 19:39.096
Blame his upbringing.
His parents.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.683
The society that would mold
this idiotic creature.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.768
Fire the employee, yes.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.728
But not the man.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.190
You may not
cancel his soul.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.775
That was never
on the table.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.610
Are you kidding?

19:54.236 --> 19:55.988
She's the queen of the
whole frigging magilla.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.699
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired.

19:59.116 --> 20:02.160
Wait, I can't get fired.
I'm an institution.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.162
I have been at this
company for 20 years.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.998
How many of you have
been here that long? Huh?

20:27.978 --> 20:29.980
Hey, hey, they're back.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.817
Hi! Oh, my gosh!
Look at you guys.

20:33.901 --> 20:34.943
Dwight, what are you
doing here?

20:35.027 --> 20:36.445
I thought you were
supposed to be in Florida.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.864
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that is, um...

20:39.156 --> 20:41.158
Wow, you look great.
Did you lose some weight?

20:41.658 --> 20:44.202
Thank you. For someone
who actually noticed this,

20:44.328 --> 20:46.747
no, I didn't lose weight,
but I started using my makeup

20:46.830 --> 20:48.081
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.499
I actually put on
five pounds.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.502
Hey, good to
have you back.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.921
Good to be back.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.050
Hey, stranger.
Hey.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.135
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.

21:03.889 --> 21:05.182
om

21:08.018 --> 21:09.436
I'm going to Florida
to get Erin.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.153
Forgot to turn off my email.
It's crazy, right?

21:18.236 --> 21:19.446
It's just when she
said she was leaving,

21:19.529 --> 21:21.907
I felt all... "You're
about to close four tabs,

21:21.990 --> 21:23.075
"are you sure you
want to continue?"

21:23.158 --> 21:24.660
Yes, I am sure.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.372
Ah! Slow computer.
