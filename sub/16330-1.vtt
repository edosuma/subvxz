(announcer) Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.468
(Borden) She can't remember who she is,

00:04.540 --> 00:06.100
where she came from, nothing.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.273
When I was ten, our next-door
neighbor went missing.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.748
I think Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw.

00:09.806 --> 00:11.239
You were never Taylor Shaw.

00:11.274 --> 00:13.264
- Who the hell are you?
- I don't know, but...

00:13.299 --> 00:15.766
Get on your knees, put
your hands on your head.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.513
Jane Doe, you're under arrest.

00:20.611 --> 00:23.699
_

00:28.073 --> 00:29.206
(Jane whimpering)

00:30.802 --> 00:31.735
Uhh!

00:32.777 --> 00:33.743
Uhh!

00:36.998 --> 00:38.451
(Jane screaming)

00:38.689 --> 00:41.321
(man) Okay, let's try this again.

00:41.356 --> 00:44.358
Why Kurt Weller?

00:46.487 --> 00:49.711
You know, you've been
here for three months.

00:49.746 --> 00:52.985
How much longer are you gonna
make us do this to you, Jane?

00:53.043 --> 00:56.498
(man, echoing) There's a place
in your mind no one can get to.

00:56.658 --> 00:58.586
A place that belongs only to you.

00:58.716 --> 01:01.257
No matter what they say,
no matter what they do,

01:01.292 --> 01:02.754
no one can reach you there.

01:02.816 --> 01:06.103
Pain... is a dream.

01:06.164 --> 01:07.530
Pain is a dream.

01:07.598 --> 01:10.070
(panting)

01:10.105 --> 01:11.635
(electricity clacking, Jane grunting)

01:14.445 --> 01:17.347
Okay... let's go swimmin'.

01:20.242 --> 01:23.138
(man) Their job is to make you
feel like you're about to die.

01:23.764 --> 01:24.947
(Jane gasping)

01:25.039 --> 01:26.635
(man) Your job is not to believe them.

01:26.705 --> 01:29.507
Your body might get weak,
but your mind is strong.

01:29.565 --> 01:30.499
(gasps)

01:32.060 --> 01:35.646
(water bubbling)

01:36.691 --> 01:37.818
(man) Get her out.

01:37.853 --> 01:39.153
Get her out!

01:41.421 --> 01:43.390
Ah, she tried to drown herself.

01:43.425 --> 01:45.526
Juice her. Hurry up!

01:49.122 --> 01:50.933
(man) Bide your time.

01:50.968 --> 01:52.990
Wait and watch.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.348
There's always a way out.

01:55.609 --> 01:56.709
Uhh!

01:56.815 --> 01:57.722
Gah!

01:57.793 --> 01:59.026
(man shouting)

01:59.299 --> 02:00.733
(both grunting)

02:05.939 --> 02:07.540
Put her in the cell.

Hang her up.

02:46.627 --> 02:48.161

02:51.451 --> 02:52.385
Ohh!

04:02.790 --> 04:04.533
- You hear that?
- (motorcycle revving)

04:08.388 --> 04:10.017
She's on a bike, headed west.

04:10.086 --> 04:12.504
Head back to the SUV.
We'll try and box her in.

05:00.288 --> 05:01.823
Weller, make a hard left.

05:02.787 --> 05:04.652
Yes, you can, if you make a hard left.

Just trust me.

Let me see your hands.

05:49.672 --> 05:53.193
Laura Moses, you're under arrest.

05:55.368 --> 05:57.517
(siren whoops, police radio chatter)

05:57.583 --> 05:59.050
Nice work today, you two.

06:01.575 --> 06:02.660
What?

06:02.767 --> 06:04.242
Nothing.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.605
Something. What?

06:07.640 --> 06:10.236
It's just a little
anticlimactic, don't you think?

06:10.271 --> 06:12.622
We spent an entire week
tracking down a counterfeiter.

06:12.689 --> 06:15.825
- It was a solid bust.
- We miss working the tattoos.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.133
(helicopter buzzing)

06:44.773 --> 06:47.273
Assistant Director Weller?

06:47.330 --> 06:50.217
My name is Naz Kamal. I work for the NSA.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.480
I need to speak with you
and your team immediately.

06:52.548 --> 06:54.249
Do you mind following me?

07:09.222 --> 07:11.002
Jane Doe has escaped.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.106
Escaped from where?

07:12.141 --> 07:14.084
The CIA swooped in and took custody

07:14.119 --> 07:16.349
before we could even process her.

07:16.421 --> 07:19.343
They've denied access
and refused to cooperate.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.525
I've been trying to get
information from them for months.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.057
They've been stonewalling me.

07:23.097 --> 07:25.552
They were holding her at
a black site in Oregon.

07:25.599 --> 07:26.489
Oh, my God.

07:26.556 --> 07:27.669
But she broke out?

07:27.704 --> 07:29.143
- (Naz) Yes.
- And you know where she is?

07:29.178 --> 07:32.781
We caught her walking past an
ATM camera in Camden, New Jersey.

07:32.847 --> 07:35.369
Why is the NSA so interested in Jane?

07:36.684 --> 07:40.749
I work for an off-book wing of
the NSA called Zero Division.

07:40.819 --> 07:42.414
(Naz) About six years ago,

07:42.472 --> 07:45.946
I started to connect a number of
seemingly random terror events.

07:45.981 --> 07:47.481
The Kentucky State Building attack,

07:47.557 --> 07:49.798
DC subway bombing, shooting at O'Hare.

07:49.872 --> 07:51.492
Those were all lone wolves.

07:51.527 --> 07:54.515
No, they were just
designed to look like that.

07:54.601 --> 07:57.483
We believe that a single
group is responsible

07:57.545 --> 08:00.907
for over a dozen domestic
terror attacks in total.

08:00.977 --> 08:03.571
I've given them the code name "Sandstorm."

08:03.641 --> 08:06.513
We cultivated an asset
within the organization,

08:06.561 --> 08:07.979
and they managed to get word to us

08:08.057 --> 08:12.368
alluding to an impending
incident in Times Square.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.320
(rumbling)

08:14.367 --> 08:17.428
We believe that Jane was
a key member of Sandstorm

08:17.507 --> 08:20.104
sent to you as a Trojan horse,

08:20.139 --> 08:22.623
and we've been monitoring
the situation ever since.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.354
The only reason we're telling you now

08:24.416 --> 08:28.268
is because we need your help to
get to Jane before the CIA does.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.468
Why?

08:29.538 --> 08:31.464
Because, before you arrested her,

08:31.525 --> 08:34.631
we believe Jane was about
to turn against Sandstorm.

08:34.698 --> 08:38.513
Look, Jane developed a deep
connection with this team.

08:38.568 --> 08:42.590
If anyone can turn her
into an asset... it's you.

08:42.676 --> 08:44.124
Not sure how connected she's gonna feel

08:44.186 --> 08:46.030
after being in a black
site for three months.

08:46.073 --> 08:48.417
Especially since we're the
ones who handed her over.

08:48.476 --> 08:50.547
We didn't hand her over. They took her.

08:50.621 --> 08:54.272
Sandstorm is planning
its biggest attack yet.

08:54.307 --> 08:55.674
(Naz) We have to try.

08:55.818 --> 08:57.419
Where is she now?

09:01.029 --> 09:03.279
_

09:04.412 --> 09:06.434
Seriously, she's just
working here at motel?

09:06.514 --> 09:08.698
As a maid, yes. It pays under the table.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.834
It's a way for her to lie
low, make a little money.

09:10.911 --> 09:12.469
Lie low and then what?

09:12.584 --> 09:14.227
Why don't you ask her yourself?

09:17.304 --> 09:18.258
(Zapata) How do you want to play this?

09:18.293 --> 09:19.609
I still say we call in local SWAT.

09:19.644 --> 09:21.823
It's one person, but
that one person is Jane.

09:21.858 --> 09:24.023
(Zapata) What are you doing?

09:24.058 --> 09:25.381
I'm gonna go in there alone.

09:25.416 --> 09:27.787
That's a very, very bad idea.

09:27.822 --> 09:30.736
- Yeah, we'll go in together.
- No... if we go in there hot,

09:30.771 --> 09:32.373
this could go bad... very bad.

09:32.408 --> 09:34.201
And if you go in there
alone, it could go worse.

09:34.275 --> 09:35.886
She had to know that someone
might find her someday.

09:35.946 --> 09:36.862
Think she's not prepared?

09:36.897 --> 09:38.434
Who knows what she's got rigged in there?

09:38.469 --> 09:39.863
I go in alone, it's unexpected.

09:39.898 --> 09:42.507
She's not gonna be happy to
see you. You know that, right?

09:44.781 --> 09:47.059
Reade... you're the side entrance.

09:47.145 --> 09:50.040
Tasha, you got the rear.
Do not move in until I say.

09:50.968 --> 09:52.398
Remove your vests.

10:18.621 --> 10:19.898
Don't move.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.393
I just wanna talk.

10:27.453 --> 10:29.507
- Yeah, with a gun in your hand.
- Jane...

10:29.564 --> 10:31.332
You wanna talk, lose the weapon!

10:35.648 --> 10:37.924
How many agents, and
where are they positioned?

10:37.959 --> 10:39.683
You need to come in.

10:39.761 --> 10:41.741
How many and where?

10:41.834 --> 10:43.589
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

10:43.656 --> 10:46.058
You don't want anyone to get hurt?

10:46.968 --> 10:49.580
Do you have idea where I have been

10:49.683 --> 10:51.797
these past three months?

10:52.027 --> 10:54.682
What they did to me, day in and day out?

10:54.731 --> 10:56.609
The CIA took you.

10:56.654 --> 10:58.392
That was never what I wanted.

10:58.427 --> 11:00.361
- Oh, no?
- I wanted justice.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.444
- Under the laws of this country.
- I don't exist, Kurt!

11:03.492 --> 11:05.757
I don't have a passport, I
don't have a birth certificate,

11:05.809 --> 11:07.760
I have no rights!

11:09.163 --> 11:10.647
Please.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.297
Put the gun down.

11:12.379 --> 11:15.514
I am not going back.

11:16.028 --> 11:18.044
Then you're gonna have to shoot me.

11:19.248 --> 11:20.482
(panting)

11:27.714 --> 11:28.781
Ah, God!

11:28.927 --> 11:30.434
- Jane! Aah!
- (cracking)

11:30.523 --> 11:31.890
(grunting)

11:34.700 --> 11:36.134
Stop it!

11:41.635 --> 11:43.102
- (panting)
- Jane...

11:45.245 --> 11:46.346
Stop it!

11:46.427 --> 11:47.894
Stop it!

11:51.063 --> 11:52.597
(both grunting)

11:56.265 --> 11:57.532
(gun cocks)

11:59.738 --> 12:01.372
(Zapata) Freeze!

12:01.430 --> 12:03.031
(Reade) Jane, drop it!

12:13.813 --> 12:15.564
(Reade) What are they hooking her up to?

12:15.599 --> 12:17.515
(Patterson) An MRI-based
coronary lie detector.

12:17.550 --> 12:22.465
It monitors even the smallest contractions
in the veins, heart, and brain.

12:22.559 --> 12:24.187
It's 100% accurate,

12:24.233 --> 12:26.453
and it makes a polygraph
look like a mood ring.

12:26.488 --> 12:27.878
Then why do we use a polygraph?

12:27.938 --> 12:30.806
(Patterson) Because... we're not
allowed to inject our subjects

12:30.878 --> 12:33.644
with substantial doses
of radioactive material.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.103
It's not exactly legal.

12:40.456 --> 12:43.458
Hello, Jane. My name is Naz.

12:53.633 --> 12:56.563
(Naz) I need you to be
completely honest with me.

12:56.626 --> 12:58.667
That's the only way that
this is going to work.

12:58.702 --> 13:01.756
What makes you think
I'll tell you anything?

13:01.834 --> 13:03.695
You managed to escape, unaided,

13:03.763 --> 13:06.518
from a CIA black site
in Oregon two weeks ago.

13:06.557 --> 13:09.050
I think it's fair to
categorize you as resourceful.

13:09.113 --> 13:10.435
You could be halfway
around the world right now,

13:10.503 --> 13:13.882
but instead, you chose to
hide in Camden, New Jersey,

13:13.936 --> 13:15.800
two hours away from here.

13:15.835 --> 13:18.556
You didn't run 'cause you're not finished.

13:18.638 --> 13:20.205
You want to find them.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.735
Well, so do I.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.943
It'll be nearly impossible to
keep the CIA from finding out

13:26.990 --> 13:29.221
that we've recaptured you.

13:29.338 --> 13:32.098
And if they do take
you back into custody...

13:32.444 --> 13:36.094
they'll keep you somewhere that
you will never break out of.

13:38.346 --> 13:40.687
Give me a reason to hold them off.

13:40.761 --> 13:44.275
You work with us, earn your freedom.

13:44.364 --> 13:47.193
Help us bring down the
people who put you here.

13:49.856 --> 13:52.187
We've been watching you since
you were found in Times Square,

13:52.222 --> 13:55.409
but we're missing some pieces.

13:55.471 --> 13:57.649
When did the operative known as Oscar

13:57.717 --> 13:59.017
first approach you?

14:09.463 --> 14:11.893
After Tom Carter kidnapped me.

14:14.567 --> 14:17.970
He abducted me and tortured me.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.514
Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.

14:20.584 --> 14:21.817
He showed me a video.

14:21.897 --> 14:24.902
It was a recording I made for
myself before they erased my memory.

14:24.980 --> 14:27.106
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

14:27.176 --> 14:28.223
And did you believe them?

14:28.258 --> 14:30.439
That you did this to yourself?

14:30.541 --> 14:31.708
Yes.

14:33.419 --> 14:35.353
I remembered Oscar.

14:35.449 --> 14:37.055
We...

14:37.547 --> 14:40.792
We were engaged before all of this.

14:42.413 --> 14:45.197
<i>What did Oscar want you to do?</i>

14:45.310 --> 14:47.442
<i>He had missions for me.</i>

14:47.520 --> 14:51.431
He said that they were
inconsequential, small.

14:51.466 --> 14:55.491
Steal a pen, replace a GPS chip.

14:55.577 --> 14:57.940
And you performed these missions willingly?

14:58.017 --> 14:59.994
No.

15:00.087 --> 15:01.774
He said that if I didn't, that...

15:01.837 --> 15:03.295
they would kill Kurt.

15:03.388 --> 15:06.462
<i>That they would kill my team.</i>

15:06.510 --> 15:07.718
(Naz) <i>And you believed him?</i>

15:07.777 --> 15:08.896
Yes.

15:08.964 --> 15:10.184
But these missions, Jane,

15:10.253 --> 15:13.262
they were neither small nor
inconsequential, were they?

15:13.325 --> 15:16.429
They had a very large, very specific goal.

15:16.464 --> 15:17.593
Yes.

15:17.642 --> 15:21.843
One that I... didn't realize
until it was too late.

15:24.221 --> 15:26.589
To frame Mayfair for murder.

15:29.173 --> 15:31.942
Where is Assistant
Director Mayfair right now?

15:39.335 --> 15:40.218
Jane?

15:40.253 --> 15:42.286
(shudders)

15:42.367 --> 15:44.348
She's dead.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.097
<i>She found us, but I don't know how.</i>

15:46.132 --> 15:47.599
<i>But she...</i>

15:48.070 --> 15:50.725
<i>And then Oscar killed her.</i>

15:51.033 --> 15:52.574
<i>He promised me no
one would get hurt,</i>

15:52.609 --> 15:54.710
and then he killed her.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.812
Where's Oscar now?

15:57.901 --> 15:59.960
He's dead.

16:00.049 --> 16:02.017
<i>I tracked him down, I wan...</i>

16:02.087 --> 16:04.874
<i>I wanted to bring him in to
put an end to all of this.</i>

16:04.909 --> 16:07.669
But he attacked me, so I killed him.

16:07.739 --> 16:08.714
Uhh!

16:09.140 --> 16:11.075
I killed him!

16:13.579 --> 16:15.266
I'm sorry.

16:15.345 --> 16:16.478
Don't touch me.

16:32.504 --> 16:34.351
She's telling the truth. The MRI...

16:34.395 --> 16:36.029
Of course she is now!

16:36.405 --> 16:37.677
She's been caught.

16:37.712 --> 16:39.419
She's hooked up to that machine.

16:39.454 --> 16:42.323
It doesn't mean we can trust her.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.411
Look...

16:47.474 --> 16:49.035
They made a mistake...

16:49.070 --> 16:51.038
when they killed Mayfair in front of her.

16:52.862 --> 16:54.703
She wants to bring them down, and...

16:54.738 --> 16:56.872
she's already killed her fiancé.

16:59.482 --> 17:01.149
She loved Mayfair.

17:03.235 --> 17:04.726
And she loved you.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.223
She's got a very funny way of showing it.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.298
You know, when...

17:18.345 --> 17:20.018
when I was a little girl,

17:20.107 --> 17:23.226
my father and I, we got
caught up in a storm.

17:23.296 --> 17:25.185
Just west of the River Indus.

17:25.221 --> 17:26.569
We couldn't see, couldn't breathe.

17:26.614 --> 17:30.710
We just... clung to each
other, praying for it to end.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.809
It's the most frightened I've ever been.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.576
Until now.

17:36.322 --> 17:40.180
These people, they give
me that same feeling.

17:40.215 --> 17:42.369
They scare me just...

17:42.463 --> 17:44.379
just like that sandstorm.

17:45.119 --> 17:47.577
How can you expect us to work with her?

17:47.655 --> 17:49.463
After everything that she's done.

17:49.533 --> 17:53.114
'Cause Jane's the first
real lead we've had in years.

17:53.149 --> 17:57.096
The safety and security of this
entire nation hangs in the balance.

17:59.013 --> 18:01.014
You want vengeance for Mayfair?

18:03.966 --> 18:05.684
Then you want Sandstorm.

18:05.762 --> 18:08.013
They're the ones that did this...

18:08.063 --> 18:09.262
not Jane.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.519
(Velcro ripping)

18:36.519 --> 18:37.786
(grunts)

18:45.092 --> 18:47.438
You have to believe...

18:47.623 --> 18:49.791
I never wanted you to be tortured.

18:51.068 --> 18:53.002
I thought I was...

18:53.263 --> 18:54.840
protecting you...

18:54.941 --> 18:56.453
all of you...

18:56.547 --> 18:58.703
by doing what they wanted.

18:58.766 --> 19:00.938
I was wrong.

19:01.206 --> 19:04.624
But the people who did this
to us are still out there.

19:05.217 --> 19:07.590
And they need to be stopped.

19:09.283 --> 19:11.414
So let's make this right.

19:11.449 --> 19:13.598
Mayfair is dead, Jane.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.121
There's no making this right.

19:17.422 --> 19:19.629
Then let's make them pay.

19:21.645 --> 19:23.109
Jane's got a fake business number

19:23.169 --> 19:25.421
she calls to set up a
meet... "Joey's Pizza."

19:25.495 --> 19:26.734
(Naz) We're gonna drive you out of the city

19:26.791 --> 19:28.521
and have you place the
call from a payphone.

19:28.571 --> 19:29.656
What's her cover?

19:29.730 --> 19:31.773
She's been missing for over three months.

19:31.841 --> 19:33.245
- Cade.
- Cade?

19:33.286 --> 19:36.340
He was a former Sandstorm
operative... he went rogue.

19:36.386 --> 19:38.942
- And tried to kill all of us.
- Before we killed him.

19:38.977 --> 19:42.023
Jane already started a false
narrative before Weller arrested her

19:42.058 --> 19:44.548
that Cade was still
alive and after her again.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.013
You tell them that Cade held
you captive and tortured you,

19:47.088 --> 19:48.972
and that you just escaped,
and you need to be brought in.

19:49.030 --> 19:51.083
- We never found a body.
- So?

19:51.153 --> 19:54.084
So what if Sandstorm got it?
Or what if he's still alive?

19:54.131 --> 19:55.103
What if they've already gotten to him?

19:55.138 --> 19:56.450
That's a lot of "ifs."

19:56.497 --> 19:59.589
Look, the NSA's been searching for Cade
ever since he crossed paths with you.

19:59.643 --> 20:00.984
If we can't find him, nobody can.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.487
Maybe you can't find him
because they already have.

20:03.541 --> 20:07.027
If even suspect Jane of lying,
they will kill her on sight.

20:07.074 --> 20:07.994
What do you want me to say?

20:08.050 --> 20:10.792
That all of this is
completely devoid of risk?

20:10.990 --> 20:12.030
We're sending her undercover

20:12.111 --> 20:15.544
to possibly the most dangerous
organization in the world.

20:15.579 --> 20:19.038
Can things go wrong? Absolutely.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.861
I feel like you don't
give a lot of pep talks.

20:22.564 --> 20:24.144
What do you think, Jane?

20:27.171 --> 20:28.571
Who's driving?

20:28.899 --> 20:30.133
(cell phone ringing)

20:35.327 --> 20:36.589
Joey's Pizza.

20:39.430 --> 20:40.950
There's a house in Woodside.

20:41.023 --> 20:43.523
Northeast corner of 72nd and 48th.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.658
We'll have someone meet you there.

20:54.179 --> 20:56.533
He gave me an address in Woodside.

20:56.758 --> 20:59.530
It wasn't Hobbes. It was
a different voice, but...

20:59.683 --> 21:00.973
It sounded familiar.

21:01.008 --> 21:03.267
After you and this Oscar guy went dark,

21:03.326 --> 21:04.600
they probably changed things up.

21:04.635 --> 21:06.617
Okay, we don't have time to waste.

21:06.707 --> 21:08.212
When you meet your new handler,

21:08.298 --> 21:10.168
you tell him that your life is on the line,

21:10.263 --> 21:12.408
that you've proven your
loyalty again and again,

21:12.443 --> 21:14.869
and that it's time for
you to meet Shepherd.

21:14.915 --> 21:16.670
So we're just letting her drive away?

21:16.710 --> 21:18.749
Arguably not one of our better plans.

21:18.784 --> 21:20.651
Mayfair's dead because of her.

21:20.729 --> 21:22.847
I wouldn't give her too much credit.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.657
What do you mean? She lied to us, she's...

21:24.703 --> 21:26.558
She's a pawn.

21:26.606 --> 21:29.411
She was a pawn for Sandstorm,
now she's a pawn for us.

21:29.469 --> 21:31.485
Pawns get sacrificed.

21:31.579 --> 21:33.582
I almost feel sorry for her.

21:33.647 --> 21:36.117
Uh, be easy. I said "almost."

21:36.167 --> 21:37.470
(Naz) It's going to take time, okay?

21:37.507 --> 21:41.036
But we need to start working our
way into the heart of Sandstorm.

21:41.087 --> 21:44.507
Find out what their endgame is
before they have a chance to execute.

21:44.575 --> 21:47.233
They're never gonna believe
I escaped Cade on my own.

21:47.299 --> 21:49.042
You've been tortured for three months.

21:49.085 --> 21:50.794
Your body's your alibi. They'll believe it.

21:50.829 --> 21:52.542
No, Cade was one of the best they had.

21:52.589 --> 21:54.463
They're never going to believe

21:54.498 --> 21:57.004
that I escaped without a serious fight.

21:57.056 --> 21:59.123
(Naz) What are you thinking?

22:00.537 --> 22:02.595
- I need you to shoot me.
- What?

22:02.679 --> 22:05.715
Look, if we want to sell how loyal
I am and how difficult this has been,

22:05.750 --> 22:08.273
it's gotta look like it cost me something.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.611
There cannot be any room for doubt.

22:10.694 --> 22:13.062
I need you to shoot me, in the side.

22:13.135 --> 22:15.488
It'll hurt a lot less than
what Sandstorm will do to me

22:15.549 --> 22:17.179
- if they don't buy my story.
- Jane...

22:17.230 --> 22:18.730
You know I'm right!

22:20.730 --> 22:21.522
(Naz) Wait. Wait!

22:21.557 --> 22:23.783
You were with Mayfair
when she died, weren't you?

22:23.855 --> 22:25.048
- Yeah, I was.
- (Naz) Okay, hold on.

22:25.098 --> 22:26.214
So what was the last thing that she said?

22:26.258 --> 22:28.458
- Jane, don't answer that.
- She said she wished

22:28.520 --> 22:30.452
that she could see your face

22:30.487 --> 22:33.280
when you found out what I really was.

22:33.343 --> 22:35.611
I'm the reason she's dead, Kurt!

22:35.648 --> 22:37.028
So do it!

22:37.117 --> 22:38.797
- (gunshot)
- (gasps)

22:40.242 --> 22:41.390
It's a clean shot.

22:41.425 --> 22:42.920
(Jane groaning)

22:42.955 --> 22:44.222
Stop!

22:44.756 --> 22:46.357
(grunting)

22:47.611 --> 22:48.283
Gah.

22:48.335 --> 22:50.465
(panting)

22:50.577 --> 22:52.695
I can do it. (grunting)

22:52.742 --> 22:54.221
I can do it!

22:55.848 --> 22:57.715
(car engine starts)

22:58.653 --> 23:00.849
(tires screeching)

23:09.556 --> 23:12.257
♪♪

23:19.819 --> 23:22.972
The tracker in your tooth will
supply us with audio and GPS.

23:23.015 --> 23:25.176
What if they scan me and
see that I'm transmitting?

23:25.259 --> 23:27.819
This is technology nobody
even knows about yet.

23:32.385 --> 23:33.583
We should have tailed her.

23:33.618 --> 23:35.832
They would have made us, made her.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.490
Don't worry, she's equipped with
one of the best trackers we have.

23:38.525 --> 23:40.017
Sound, GPS. Battery lasts...

23:40.068 --> 23:41.663
- She just ditched it.
- She what?

23:41.698 --> 23:42.597
Well, either that, or she's currently

23:42.645 --> 23:44.555
laying down in the middle
of the Pulaski Bridge.

23:44.636 --> 23:45.978
I'm gonna say she ditched it.

23:46.013 --> 23:48.974
Of course she did. I'd
have done the same thing.

23:49.055 --> 23:51.861
And if Sandstorm is half
as good as you say they are,

23:51.896 --> 23:53.251
they're gonna scan her.

23:53.345 --> 23:54.661
That tracker's nearly invisible.

23:54.723 --> 23:58.134
And if they found it, I bet
they'd nearly keep her alive.

23:58.202 --> 24:00.516
Besides, your big radioactive lie detector

24:00.605 --> 24:02.962
told you that she was telling the truth.

24:03.017 --> 24:05.780
That means she's gonna come back, right?

24:05.939 --> 24:07.239
Right.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.532
We have to talk about this.

24:12.683 --> 24:15.151
(Jane panting and grunting)

24:18.519 --> 24:19.786
(man) It's you.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.936
I can't believe it's actually you.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.935
I'm Roman, uh... Do you remember me?

24:32.636 --> 24:34.384
- Who shot you?
- Cade.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.730
Cade, he was hold...
holding me, torturing me.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.162
(panting) I remembered my training.

24:39.232 --> 24:41.785
(Jane grunting)

24:41.863 --> 24:42.952
I was... I was able to get away,

24:42.987 --> 24:43.963
but not before he got a shot off.

24:43.998 --> 24:47.101
Look, there's a medical cache
about five miles away from here.

24:47.187 --> 24:48.317
Let's get you patched up.

24:48.391 --> 24:49.491
(grunting)

24:51.852 --> 24:54.353
(tires screeching)

24:55.557 --> 24:56.791
(Roman) Hold on, Taylor.

24:56.865 --> 24:58.428
I know I'm not Taylor.

24:58.501 --> 25:00.089
Oscar told me.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.155
He should never have been your handler.

25:04.190 --> 25:05.787
What else did he tell you?

25:05.822 --> 25:08.874
I have been in a dark
hole for three months.

25:08.976 --> 25:10.692
I want to talk to Shepherd!

25:10.742 --> 25:15.007
And I am not saying another
word until you take me to him.

25:15.313 --> 25:18.225
(chuckling) It's good to see you again.

25:21.586 --> 25:22.884
Damn it.

25:22.993 --> 25:25.061
DUI checkpoint.

25:25.102 --> 25:26.589
We're boxed in.

25:26.675 --> 25:28.652
We're gonna have to talk our way through.

25:28.878 --> 25:30.312
Are you up for this?

25:31.870 --> 25:34.539
(distant thunder)

25:37.393 --> 25:39.419
Cover your wound with this.

25:40.198 --> 25:41.377
(Zapata) We really have to do this?

25:41.448 --> 25:44.070
Work with Jane and pretend
that everything is normal?

25:44.105 --> 25:46.304
No! You don't.

25:46.358 --> 25:50.115
I'm not gonna make any of you do
anything that you don't believe in.

25:50.185 --> 25:51.627
(Patterson) So, you believe in it?

25:52.157 --> 25:53.928
You believe in her?

25:54.688 --> 25:59.170
I believe this Sandstorm group that Jane
<i>was</i> a part of needs to be stopped.

25:59.205 --> 26:00.371
(Reade) Was?

26:00.441 --> 26:01.696
How can you be so sure?

26:01.789 --> 26:02.729
(Weller) I can't be.

26:02.771 --> 26:04.249
Not 100%.

26:04.284 --> 26:06.550
No matter what that machine says.

26:06.614 --> 26:08.906
But I am sure that Jane
didn't do this alone.

26:08.941 --> 26:11.519
I want to get the people
that did this to us.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.484
Did this to Mayfair.

26:13.851 --> 26:15.386
If that means that I have
to swallow my feelings

26:15.462 --> 26:18.765
about Jane for a while... so be it.

26:23.084 --> 26:24.767
I'm in.

26:25.109 --> 26:26.610
For Mayfair.

26:28.562 --> 26:30.029
For Mayfair.

26:33.137 --> 26:34.404
For Mayfair.

26:35.057 --> 26:36.990
Speaking of which...

26:37.068 --> 26:40.322
our new NSA friend might be
able to help us with this.

26:42.204 --> 26:43.637
(rain pattering)

26:47.695 --> 26:49.083
- Good evenin'.
- Evenin'.

26:49.127 --> 26:50.704
You been drinkin' tonight?

26:50.739 --> 26:51.641
Not yet.

26:51.679 --> 26:53.376
Just closed up shop and headed home.

26:53.438 --> 26:54.694
Yeah? Where do you work?

26:54.729 --> 26:57.871
Little tattoo parlor on 78th and Roosevelt.

26:58.552 --> 26:59.953
All right.

27:01.766 --> 27:03.145
Ma'am, are you bleeding?

27:03.199 --> 27:05.875
No... I'm fine.

27:05.910 --> 27:08.032
Oh, she... she had some stitches open up.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.617
I'm taking her back to the doctor now.

27:10.682 --> 27:12.822
I thought you were headed home.

27:12.876 --> 27:15.473
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- I'm okay, yes.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.844
Step out of the vehicle for me, sir.

27:21.930 --> 27:25.257
Officer, we need to get her to the
hospital. Is this totally necessary?

27:25.308 --> 27:27.442
Out of the vehicle, sir, now.

27:33.513 --> 27:34.812
Okay.

27:43.791 --> 27:45.459
(rain pattering loudly)

27:55.881 --> 27:57.048
(glass breaks)

27:59.625 --> 28:00.558
(gunshots)

28:08.355 --> 28:09.816
(gunshots)

28:18.003 --> 28:20.304
♪♪

28:30.253 --> 28:31.585
(Roman) You're fading.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.918
(Jane) Stop... stalling

28:32.965 --> 28:34.730
and take me to Shepherd... where is he?

28:34.773 --> 28:36.559
Shepherd? You won't
make it to the med cache.

28:36.656 --> 28:37.940
We gotta get you to the hospital.

28:37.981 --> 28:39.628
And tell them what?

28:39.687 --> 28:41.754
I have a way with words.

28:41.789 --> 28:44.019
Before Mayfair disap... (sighs)

28:44.378 --> 28:47.981
Before she... died...

28:48.064 --> 28:50.269
uh, she left us...

28:50.339 --> 28:53.778
She left us a drive with
a bunch of encrypted files.

28:53.813 --> 28:55.955
Daylight was an illegal NSA program.

28:56.019 --> 28:58.886
But I'm guessing we don't
have to fill you in on that.

28:58.964 --> 28:59.591
And ORION?

28:59.627 --> 29:01.657
From the parts we can read,
ORION seems to have been

29:01.712 --> 29:05.066
a secret, off-book spec-ops wing of the
Naval Special Warfare development group.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.636
- Like Seal Team 6?
- (Weller) Yeah.

29:06.696 --> 29:08.650
But they weren't just
going after the bad guys.

29:08.729 --> 29:10.583
Along with a lot of other horrible things,

29:10.628 --> 29:13.448
the files indicate that they
bombed the French Embassy in Sudan.

29:13.483 --> 29:14.708
And sunk a commercial cruise ship.

29:14.765 --> 29:17.281
And assassinated the
Secretary General of the UN.

29:17.316 --> 29:20.790
- Well, no, that was Al-Qaeda.
- Not according to this.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.257
A lot of the ORION files
are still encrypted.

29:23.330 --> 29:24.762
(Zapata) Like this one.

29:24.859 --> 29:26.164
Pixel fragments.

29:26.241 --> 29:27.730
It's like trying to fit together

29:27.765 --> 29:30.027
a million jigsaw pieces
that are all the same shape.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.637
(Patterson) I've been
trying to write a program

29:31.683 --> 29:34.010
that'll sort, analyze,
and reassemble everything,

29:34.111 --> 29:35.912
pixel by pixel, but it...

29:35.947 --> 29:37.340
Whatever. It's a little involved.

29:37.431 --> 29:41.767
Our binary system here is having
some problems with the raw data.

29:41.810 --> 29:43.174
- So...
- So...

29:43.209 --> 29:45.057
I was kind of sort of hoping

29:45.141 --> 29:48.825
that you could give us access to
the NSA's quantum computer farm.

29:48.875 --> 29:51.744
Our quantum server farm
doesn't technically exist.

29:51.779 --> 29:53.121
Well, heh, right.

29:53.195 --> 29:54.996
But, technically, neither do you.

29:55.714 --> 29:57.013
I'll make the call.

29:57.082 --> 30:00.251
Look, what's in M7G677?

30:00.485 --> 30:01.396
A black hole.

30:01.431 --> 30:04.777
- In what sense?
- In the literal sense.

30:04.855 --> 30:06.767
It's an image file of a black hole.

30:06.859 --> 30:09.130
- (Naz) That's it?
- That's it.

30:09.165 --> 30:11.234
There are three folders on this drive.

30:11.269 --> 30:13.510
Two contain information on maybe the most

30:13.572 --> 30:15.763
sensitive programs this
government ever operated, and...

30:15.836 --> 30:18.617
Yeah, and the third is a decent
desktop wallpaper, we know.

30:18.714 --> 30:20.482
There's gotta be something hidden in it,

30:20.555 --> 30:22.957
on it, with it... we just can't see it yet.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.068
Use their secret and, I'm
assuming, illegal quantum farm.

30:26.130 --> 30:29.387
Focus on the pixel fragments
and see what we can get.

30:33.997 --> 30:37.180
All right, well, they've
got a fun vibe so far.

30:41.445 --> 30:42.869
Sit tight.

30:59.497 --> 31:00.697
(knocking on window)

31:03.638 --> 31:06.157
Everything okay? Do you need help, ma'am?

31:06.224 --> 31:08.461
(Roman) I got this, officer!

31:08.525 --> 31:09.500
Thank you.

31:10.371 --> 31:11.443
Need a hand?

31:15.052 --> 31:17.086
Sure. That'd be great.

31:18.487 --> 31:19.687
(grunts)

31:22.365 --> 31:23.899
(grunts)

31:24.444 --> 31:26.669
I'm sorry, but this is gonna hurt.

31:26.805 --> 31:28.314
I've had worse.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.057
Try to work as fast as I can, okay?

31:40.769 --> 31:44.128
How... how long have
we known each other for?

31:44.232 --> 31:46.196
A very long time.

31:46.301 --> 31:47.634
(door opens)

32:01.583 --> 32:03.050
I miss you.

32:08.082 --> 32:09.416
(whispering) Okay.

32:13.072 --> 32:15.499
- Look, can I...
- What?

32:15.573 --> 32:17.026
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.133
Like how you hung back
and watched us for a year,

32:19.185 --> 32:20.448
didn't share any of your intel?

32:20.483 --> 32:21.331
Now my boss is dead.

32:21.366 --> 32:23.822
Listen, I thought I cornered
Sandstorm a year ago.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.886
We had an active asset inside who was

32:25.956 --> 32:27.544
very close to finding out who Shepherd was,

32:27.588 --> 32:30.061
but then it all fell apart.

32:30.131 --> 32:30.977
What happened?

32:31.043 --> 32:34.045
Sandstorm had someone inside the NSA.

32:34.946 --> 32:37.269
A friend of mine, actually.

32:37.355 --> 32:39.584
We managed to neutralize him, but...

32:39.818 --> 32:42.754
not before he killed three of my people.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.996
Sorry to hear that.

32:45.156 --> 32:48.902
Listen, I can't afford another mistake.

32:48.937 --> 32:51.261
And I can feel the clock
is running down on this.

32:51.319 --> 32:55.462
No one outside of your team must
know what our true objective is.

32:55.525 --> 32:57.055
We can't risk another breach.

32:57.107 --> 32:58.597
- I agree.
- (Patterson) Hey...

32:58.632 --> 33:01.250
- Jane's tracker just came back online.
- How?

33:01.285 --> 33:03.559
I implanted a second tracker on her belt.

33:03.637 --> 33:04.473
You what?

33:04.508 --> 33:07.512
It's programmed to start
transmitting two hours after she left.

33:07.573 --> 33:09.449
Look, it's a backup plan,
in case she felt compelled

33:09.535 --> 33:10.795
to dispose of the first one.

33:10.830 --> 33:12.200
So what happens if they scan her?

33:12.286 --> 33:13.705
They'd do it the second
they encountered her.

33:13.754 --> 33:15.688
That's why there's a delay.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.320
You're gonna get her killed.

33:20.093 --> 33:22.161
(rain pattering)

33:25.786 --> 33:27.320
(gasping)

33:28.583 --> 33:31.002
It's okay, we're the same blood type.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.071
Trust me.

33:33.207 --> 33:35.520
- Where are you taking me?
- Somewhere safe.

33:35.589 --> 33:37.805
No... I want answers.

33:37.899 --> 33:40.290
Who is Shepherd? What's ORION?

33:40.346 --> 33:42.614
You'll find out when we get there.

33:45.939 --> 33:47.363
Gotta shut it down, Patterson.

33:47.425 --> 33:48.920
All right, they're taking Jane in deep.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.930
If she's caught with a
transmitter, they'll kill her.

33:50.977 --> 33:53.084
It's not that easy...
this kind of transmitter

33:53.127 --> 33:54.525
isn't designed to be shut down remotely.

33:54.593 --> 33:55.964
All right, fine! So redesign it.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.958
It's... that doesn't even
make any sense, you can't...

33:58.047 --> 33:59.660
Patterson, just find a way around it!

33:59.709 --> 34:01.281
Okay, finding, finding.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.641
(keyboard clacking)

34:08.828 --> 34:10.516
What's going on?

34:20.005 --> 34:21.164
Did you sweep her?

34:21.234 --> 34:22.123
You better find her fast.

34:22.158 --> 34:23.514
She doesn't know that she's been bugged.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.867
Find a way to shut it down... now!

34:24.902 --> 34:27.474
Stop yelling! It's not helping me code!

34:27.518 --> 34:30.132
<i>Cade's had her in a
hole for three months.</i>

34:30.194 --> 34:32.319
She took a bullet to get back to us.

34:32.391 --> 34:33.757
That's all I need to know.

34:33.793 --> 34:36.043
You'll forgive me if I need a little more.

34:36.101 --> 34:37.933
You think I'm wired?

34:38.038 --> 34:40.873
After everything I just
went through for you?

34:40.931 --> 34:42.964
You think I'm working for them?

34:43.038 --> 34:44.483
You know what?

34:44.610 --> 34:47.230
If that's what it takes to meet Shepherd...

34:47.297 --> 34:48.719
<i>sweep me.</i>

34:49.241 --> 34:51.109
There. It's off.

34:51.213 --> 34:52.478
Damn, I'm good.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.723
My apologies.

35:04.790 --> 35:07.046
We can't be too careful, can we?

35:07.186 --> 35:08.466
(chuckles softly)

35:08.628 --> 35:10.886
It's so good to see you again.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.136
- You're...
- I'm Shepherd.

35:18.223 --> 35:19.821
I'm your mother.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.834
M... My mother?

35:30.908 --> 35:32.063
But... how... how is that...

35:32.098 --> 35:34.534
You were born in Pretoria, South Africa.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.442
Your real name is Alice Kruger.

35:37.477 --> 35:38.495
(gasping)

35:38.589 --> 35:42.381
Your birth parents were
antiapartheid activists.

35:42.486 --> 35:45.522
The government had them
killed... in your own home.

35:47.127 --> 35:48.969
You were forced into a secret academy,

35:49.032 --> 35:51.478
an orphanage, where they
trained innocent children

35:51.544 --> 35:53.943
to become deadly soldiers.

35:54.005 --> 35:56.481
Operatives for the state.

35:56.535 --> 35:58.071
Of course, you excelled.

35:58.123 --> 36:01.272
But when apartheid
fell, so did the academy.

36:01.330 --> 36:04.143
I was one of the American
soldiers who liberated you.

36:04.178 --> 36:06.837
Most of the children were
placed in foster care,

36:06.891 --> 36:09.609
but you and your brother...

36:09.666 --> 36:11.213
were too dangerous.

36:12.279 --> 36:13.778
Too special.

36:13.825 --> 36:15.222
No one could handle you.

36:15.280 --> 36:18.177
So I chose to raise you myself.

36:18.238 --> 36:20.470
(stammering) Wait...

36:20.528 --> 36:22.360
You wanted new names...

36:22.412 --> 36:25.972
to distance yourself from
a past you wanted to forget.

36:26.037 --> 36:28.070
We chose them together.

36:28.181 --> 36:31.283
Roman... and Remi.

36:33.054 --> 36:34.770
It's a lot to take in.

36:35.022 --> 36:37.812
But... what about...

36:37.862 --> 36:40.627
ORION and... and Phase Two?

36:42.499 --> 36:44.461
Wha... what?

36:45.324 --> 36:47.262
Oscar's dead.

36:47.367 --> 36:48.292
Uhh!

36:49.461 --> 36:50.561
Cade got him.

36:50.673 --> 36:52.373
Before he got to you.

36:54.008 --> 36:56.130
I'm sorry, I...

36:56.310 --> 36:59.312
I know how much the two
of you loved each other.

36:59.449 --> 37:01.486
Roman has been moving heaven and earth

37:01.550 --> 37:04.753
since you disappeared,
trying to track down Cade.

37:05.142 --> 37:09.446
And I promise you... he
will pay for what he did.

37:10.401 --> 37:11.601
(Jane gasps)

37:14.328 --> 37:17.155
It's almost dawn, I can't
be out in the open like this.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.301
You need to get back to the FBI.

37:19.347 --> 37:21.366
What? She... She just got here.

37:21.464 --> 37:23.198
Tell them Cade kidnapped you.

37:23.248 --> 37:24.655
That you escaped.

37:24.690 --> 37:26.730
There might still be a
way to salvage this op.

37:26.781 --> 37:29.828
I want answers. I... I need answers.

37:29.867 --> 37:31.620
That's enough for tonight.

37:31.687 --> 37:33.265
You'll get more soon.

37:33.300 --> 37:36.462
But right now, we need
to get you back in play.

37:37.301 --> 37:38.521
Oh...

37:48.380 --> 37:50.778
I've missed this face.

37:51.348 --> 37:54.494
It's so good to have you back, Remi.

37:54.587 --> 37:57.897
All of the pieces are almost into place.

37:58.006 --> 38:01.460
You don't have to live this
double life for much longer.

38:02.622 --> 38:04.256
We're almost ready.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.361
(car engine starts)

38:17.188 --> 38:18.389
Here...

38:20.106 --> 38:23.022
We can't exactly drop you back at the FBI.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.042
Before I left you in Times Square,

38:31.141 --> 38:33.943
I said an old Afrikaans prayer for you.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.984
For a safe journey and...

38:36.122 --> 38:38.481
a quick return home.

38:38.570 --> 38:41.830
You got neither. So much for prayer.

38:42.964 --> 38:44.497
Remi and Roman.

38:44.747 --> 38:46.242
(chuckles softly)

38:46.315 --> 38:47.882
My brother.

38:48.717 --> 38:51.399
Oh... I got you something.

38:52.168 --> 38:54.365
Been holding onto it for you.

38:54.675 --> 38:56.676
I think it's time you got it back.

39:04.557 --> 39:06.420
_

39:24.582 --> 39:26.614
(Weller) Your mother and your brother?

39:26.649 --> 39:28.718
(Naz) So, Shepherd's military.

39:28.783 --> 39:29.788
Or was.

39:29.849 --> 39:34.678
That certainly explains her access to
some of the nation's biggest secrets.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.388
This is an unbelievable start.

39:37.447 --> 39:38.718
Great work, okay?

39:38.753 --> 39:40.762
You try and get some rest.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.360
(chair scoots back)

39:47.810 --> 39:50.444
Why didn't you tell me about the tooth?

39:50.590 --> 39:51.590
What?

39:51.698 --> 39:55.639
Naz told me that Patterson ran
an isotopic test on my tooth

39:55.674 --> 39:57.501
when I first got here.

39:57.536 --> 39:59.077
She told you I was born in Africa.

39:59.127 --> 40:01.764
That I couldn't be Taylor Shaw.

40:03.373 --> 40:06.367
- Your DNA matched.
- But my tooth didn't.

40:06.402 --> 40:07.686
Why didn't you tell me?

40:07.726 --> 40:10.439
I believed I was Taylor Shaw because
I... had no reason to doubt...

40:10.491 --> 40:13.171
Because I didn't want it to be true.

40:13.247 --> 40:15.211
I wanted you to be Taylor.

40:16.761 --> 40:18.444
More than anything.

40:20.174 --> 40:22.375
I guess they knew that.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.866
How did you get the memories?

40:27.964 --> 40:30.966
Of fishing with me and my father.

40:32.903 --> 40:35.105
They told me I was her.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.115
Oscar gave me photos...

40:37.190 --> 40:38.633
and said to lie...

40:38.668 --> 40:40.702
and say that I remembered them.

40:40.796 --> 40:42.063
Why did you?

40:42.331 --> 40:43.657
Because I...

40:43.812 --> 40:45.992
I wanted it to be true.

40:47.505 --> 40:49.789
Because I wanted to be Taylor.

40:50.725 --> 40:52.653
More than anything.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.432
See you tomorrow.

41:10.961 --> 41:12.903
You guys decode the Mayfair picture?

41:12.938 --> 41:13.938
(Patterson) Pictures.

41:13.983 --> 41:15.605
(Zapata) Looks like
drone photos of bad ops.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.755
Crashed helicopters,
dead American soldiers.

41:19.724 --> 41:22.807
Patterson... can you zoom in on that one?

41:22.864 --> 41:25.733
Yeah, the resolution's
actually kind of amazing.

41:28.150 --> 41:30.318
- Whoa, is that...
- It's Jane.

41:34.811 --> 41:36.077
Do you believe her?

41:36.953 --> 41:38.260
Of course.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.580
Something feels off.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.299
We erased her memory and then
sent her into a lion's den.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.705
She was kidnapped and
tortured for three months.

41:47.781 --> 41:49.404
I'd be a little off, too.

41:49.464 --> 41:52.438
My sister's still in there... I'm positive.

41:53.157 --> 41:54.653
I'm not.

41:55.509 --> 41:57.604
Then activate our mole in the FBI.

41:57.639 --> 41:59.022
Have them tell you.

41:59.096 --> 42:01.665
No... not yet.

42:01.742 --> 42:03.886
It's too dangerous.
Everyone will be watching.

42:03.975 --> 42:07.696
Do it too soon, and we risk burning
them for later, when we really need them.

42:07.785 --> 42:10.808
For now, that's the ace
we need to hold onto.

42:12.976 --> 42:14.944
Don't worry.

42:15.017 --> 42:16.518
It won't be long now.
