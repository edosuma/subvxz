WEBVTT

03:07.646 --> 03:10.274
Campbell!

03:14.070 --> 03:19.575
- I'm sorry. You wanted me?
- I'm Karl Hettinger, your new partner.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.081
Ian Campbell.
Welcome to the felony squad.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.334
I thought they were woofing me
when they said I could find you here.

03:28.459 --> 03:32.213
I was just bouncing
a few notes off the walls.

03:32.338 --> 03:36.258
If I do it at home,
the neighbors call the cops.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.391
I don't know how you can stand it.

03:43.516 --> 03:46.852
This place gives me the crawlies.
It's like a tomb.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.981
A piper plays where he can.
It's in me blood, you know, laddie.

03:51.107 --> 03:55.820
- Strange music. What's it called?
- Cha Till MacCruimen.

03:55.945 --> 03:57.571
It's an ancient funeral dirge.

03:57.697 --> 04:01.575
And that means,
"MacCrimmon will never return."

04:01.951 --> 04:04.495
- Ian?
- Yeah?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.498
How long have you been
hanging around in cellars?

04:07.623 --> 04:10.459
Talk to anybody about it?

04:25.808 --> 04:28.644
Hey! Youngblood!

04:28.894 --> 04:31.355
Jimmy Youngblood!

04:39.321 --> 04:43.200
- Say, old thing, how you doing?
- Jimmy, my man! When did you get out?

04:43.325 --> 04:46.162
- Yesterday.
- Damn! Ain't that a mother?

04:46.287 --> 04:48.873
Hop on up and let me
have this boy clean some skates.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.791
They could do with some help.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.169
I could do it my own self, if it's okay.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.172
Like they say,
once a shine boy, always a shine boy.

04:56.297 --> 05:00.885
Go ahead, help yourself.
My man, buy yourself a trip to Hawaii.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.346
You look like new money.
Guess your ship came in.

05:03.471 --> 05:07.475
Sure did. Jimmy, meet my partner.

05:09.018 --> 05:12.229
- I'm Greg Powell.
- This is a homeboy, Greg.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.231
Always called him Youngblood.

05:14.357 --> 05:17.610
Everybody on East Sixth Street
got an alias.

05:17.735 --> 05:20.738
- Youngblood your righteous name, Jimmy?
- Good as any, ain't it?

05:20.863 --> 05:23.741
Now, a man's name ain't important.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.744
Being a loyal, standup guy,
that's what's important.

05:26.869 --> 05:30.331
And any friend of Billy's, etc., etc...

05:31.040 --> 05:32.416
Say, Jim...

05:32.541 --> 05:35.044
You know, those kind of look
like jailhouse hot dogs.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.171
You just got out of the slammer,
didn't you?

05:37.296 --> 05:40.132
Seems like everybody in LA
got a thing for shoes these days.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.593
Used to be pussy before I went away.

05:42.718 --> 05:45.805
Greg, my man, come on,
let's go do our business.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.099
Jimmy, see you around.

05:48.224 --> 05:51.686
Say, brother, how about loaning me 10
scoots till I get myself together?

05:51.811 --> 05:53.270
Go see the car wash boss.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.315
He pays minimum wages
to any ex-con who wants a job.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.900
Minimum wage?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.444
I expect more than that
for watching flies fuck.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.531
Say, Jim, now,
I just got out 10 months ago, myself.

06:03.656 --> 06:08.411
Paroled from Vacaville.
And I know how you're feeling about now.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.790
- Like, thanks for the loan.
- Hell, Jim, that ain't a loan, it's a gift.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.667
Billy, give him $5 more.

06:14.792 --> 06:18.713
Shit, what do I look like,
the Bank of America?

06:20.214 --> 06:25.219
Man, go see the car wash boss.
He pays minimum wages.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.975
- Where you staying, Jimmy?
- A little hotel on Sixth and Wall.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.771
- How you planning to make money, Jim?
- Same way you guys make yours.

06:37.690 --> 06:39.942
See you around, Jimbo.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.737
Catch you later, Greg.

06:43.029 --> 06:46.282
Cornpone, jive-ass, peckerwood.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.751
Think you're gonna like felony, Kars?

06:57.710 --> 07:00.254
It beats wearing a blue suit.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.507
Beats writing traffic tickets.

07:03.632 --> 07:07.636
It might be boring most of the time,
but who knows?

07:07.970 --> 07:11.349
There might be something
right around the corner.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.601
Something?

07:16.354 --> 07:22.151
Not thrills,
but something other folks don't see.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.863
What if it's something
you don't understand?

07:25.988 --> 07:28.032
I don't know.

07:28.157 --> 07:32.078
It doesn't matter, I guess,
just as long as it's something.

07:32.203 --> 07:35.498
To be there is the thing, partner.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.669
Yes, sir?

07:39.794 --> 07:43.631
- You feel like another piece?
- I finally got my weight below 200.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.800
I'll get it for you.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.469
At least you're tall enough to carry it.

07:48.594 --> 07:52.973
Married life's making me feel
like an avocado with feet.

07:53.307 --> 07:57.395
That's just a little excess
adipose tissue.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.899
What were you going to do
before you became a cop?

08:02.024 --> 08:05.194
You'll never guess.
I was a premed student.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.947
I could have guessed.

08:09.824 --> 08:12.118
There you go.

08:14.870 --> 08:19.333
- What did your dad do?
- He was a doctor.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.838
He died when I was a boy.

08:24.547 --> 08:29.010
My mother and I always figured
that I'd become a doctor, too.

08:32.013 --> 08:36.100
College dropouts sure end up
in the strangest jobs.

08:48.571 --> 08:53.117
When I worked vice,
I busted that pig for beating up a whore.

08:53.868 --> 08:57.204
There's a guy that could use a doctor.

08:59.248 --> 09:03.002
Dr. Smith & Wesson,
for a frontal lobotomy.

09:03.753 --> 09:07.882
- A large cheese to go.
- Come back in 20 minutes, okay?

09:08.007 --> 09:10.593
I'm a fellow dropout.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.305
Let me guess. Engineering.

09:15.431 --> 09:20.728
Agriculture, beer, and poker,
not necessarily in that order.

09:22.855 --> 09:26.442
My life's ambition was to own a farm.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.988
Truck crops.

09:31.947 --> 09:37.328
You know, smogless sky, clean earth...

09:37.453 --> 09:41.874
clean people, all that corny stuff.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.670
And acres of dewy, wet...

09:45.795 --> 09:48.964
fat, ripe tomatoes.

09:49.548 --> 09:52.134
- Tomatoes?
- Tomatoes.

09:52.677 --> 09:56.430
Police work's so noisy.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.142
- Tomatoes are so...
- Quiet.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:07.066 --> 10:10.611
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.364
No, like, I meant to look you up.

10:13.489 --> 10:15.741
It's only been two days.
I ain't made a sting yet.

10:15.866 --> 10:19.704
- I'll pay you and Billy back.
- Hell, Jim, I told you, that was a gift.

10:19.829 --> 10:22.498
That ain't why I'm here.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.209
- This sure is a dump, Jimbo.
- Yeah.

10:25.334 --> 10:28.212
It ain't forever.
My parole officer paid for a week.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.298
- By then, I should have...
- Come on, get your clothes on.

10:31.424 --> 10:33.467
- We are going somewhere.
- Yeah?

10:33.592 --> 10:37.430
- I thought I'd go look my old partner...
- I won't take no for an answer.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.224
I got a feeling about you.

10:40.349 --> 10:44.061
I think I can help you
make some real money.

10:45.855 --> 10:48.315
Real money, Jimbo.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.809
Lollipop?

11:24.060 --> 11:25.686
Youngblood, what you doin' here?

11:25.811 --> 11:29.440
- Greg brung me.
- Yeah.

11:29.732 --> 11:33.027
We all don't need nobody else
working with us, you understand?

11:33.152 --> 11:36.113
Jimmy, this here is my little woman.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.617
- Hi, Jimmy.
- You fix us a whiskey and 7-Up?

11:39.742 --> 11:42.912
- Okay, honey?
- Okay, buns.

11:43.287 --> 11:47.249
Honey, buns. Just sit down, Jim.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.426
So, Billy...

11:58.302 --> 12:00.638
My woman says
you took that roll of $1 bills...

12:00.763 --> 12:02.807
I had stashed in the bedroom.

12:02.932 --> 12:06.686
- Bullshit.
- Yes, it's true. She can't find it.

12:06.811 --> 12:11.524
And furthermore, I've been told,
you gave her a pat on the fanny today.

12:11.649 --> 12:14.568
I don't care about the pat.

12:14.694 --> 12:18.614
We're sort of a family here.
I'd appreciate you don't make it a habit.

12:18.739 --> 12:22.576
- Greg, please...
- Billy, I want my dough back.

12:23.619 --> 12:26.706
Maybe she took it.

12:32.503 --> 12:37.466
After all I've done for you,
and you dare steal from me!

12:38.592 --> 12:41.512
I know that whiskey
makes you do wrong things.

12:41.637 --> 12:45.474
Or I'd bust a cap in your goddamn head.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.185
Now, Billy,
we're gonna go out again tonight.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.356
Only this time, you're gonna
pull your own weight.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.942
And if you don't get me my money...

12:55.067 --> 12:57.695
Anything you say, brother, anything.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.698
Jimmy, you're in. Can you drive?

13:00.823 --> 13:04.994
- Greg, like, I've been away five years.
- Goddamn it! Can you drive?

13:05.119 --> 13:08.581
Yeah, I can drive.

13:11.584 --> 13:14.295
All right, then.

13:23.262 --> 13:28.309
- How do you like my car, Jimbo?
- Yeah, it's groovy, Greg.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.936
The clutch slips bad, though.

13:31.062 --> 13:35.232
Maybe after a good score, you ought
to think about getting another car.

13:35.358 --> 13:37.568
I had the clutch fixed
that way on purpose.

13:37.693 --> 13:40.613
Keeps the guy from speeding away
from a job and drawing heat.

13:40.738 --> 13:43.324
On purpose? Yeah!

13:43.449 --> 13:45.826
By the way, Jimbo...

13:45.951 --> 13:49.997
- Notice anything unusual about me?
- No.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.417
Yeah, Greg.
I mean, you do look different.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.128
But I can't figure out
why you look different.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.631
Goddamn it,
it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

13:58.756 --> 14:02.802
Like, you're wearing
a Humphrey Bogart trench coat.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.553
That it?

14:04.679 --> 14:07.264
Greg, I can't see too good.
I need glasses and all.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.559
Jim, for Christ's sake, look at my ear!

14:10.685 --> 14:12.770
Look, see there?

14:12.895 --> 14:15.439
I put a little mole on my ear
with my honey's mascara.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.108
Stuck a few hairs in it.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.985
Then I darkened my eyebrows,
made them bigger, see?

14:20.111 --> 14:23.906
Any witness will say, "The guy had
bushy eyebrows and a mole on his ear."

14:24.031 --> 14:28.703
Now, that's slick.
That's slicker than slop!

14:41.465 --> 14:44.218
Okay, Billy, this is the job I cased.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.304
Now's your chance to get back
the money you stole from me.

14:47.430 --> 14:50.808
- And you better get it.
- I swear, I didn't steal no money, man.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.269
Just go in there
and get me at least $50...

14:53.394 --> 14:57.690
and maybe you'll prove to me
that you didn't do what I know you did.

15:14.832 --> 15:19.462
This is the last night for old Billy.
I got to cut him loose.

15:19.587 --> 15:22.131
He drinks too much.

15:22.340 --> 15:27.470
I think, after tonight, it's gonna be you
who's a part of our little family.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.185
I can't do it, Greg.
The guy in the store knows me.

15:34.310 --> 15:36.312
- What?
- He knows me, Greg.

15:36.437 --> 15:38.647
Guy used to work at the shine parlor.

15:38.773 --> 15:40.858
You lying, thieving...

15:40.983 --> 15:44.487
Jimmy, tell him. Guy named Hellfire Jack.
Ain't that right?

15:44.612 --> 15:47.031
When we drove by,
I did think I saw Hellfire Jack.

15:47.156 --> 15:49.700
I think it's Hellfire Jack in there.

15:49.825 --> 15:50.993
See? I told you.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.330
Used to work over there
on East Fifth Street. Used to...

15:54.455 --> 15:58.668
It's the truth. He used to work
in a process parlor over there.

15:59.001 --> 16:04.090
- I thought you said a shine parlor.
- Process parlor, man! He did my hair.

16:04.215 --> 16:07.009
He said a process parlor.

16:08.761 --> 16:10.388
Fuck it.

16:10.513 --> 16:14.225
- I'll do it myself.
- Yeah, you go ahead on and do it.

16:14.350 --> 16:17.228
I'll help Jimmy drive.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.902
I use this little hop, skip, jump,
which moves me fast.

16:25.027 --> 16:28.072
It isn't noticeable to someone
passing by, like running is.

16:28.197 --> 16:31.992
When you see me skip,
start this baby moving!

16:33.327 --> 16:35.579
"Skip, jump."

16:35.705 --> 16:39.667
Like a goddamn kangaroo
jumping around out there.

16:41.877 --> 16:45.423
All this funny talk!
"Furthermore, wherefore!"

16:45.548 --> 16:47.967
Don't give me any more
"furtherfore" or "whereover"...

16:48.092 --> 16:51.429
or any more of that funky-ass bullshit!

16:51.554 --> 16:57.184
Greg said he was paroled out of Vacaville.
That's a nut jail.

17:06.736 --> 17:09.155
Let her go, Jimbo.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.324
- Goddamn it, let the clutch out!
- I did. It ain't going nowhere.

17:12.450 --> 17:16.037
Let the goddamn clutch all the way out!

17:16.412 --> 17:19.373
Now you're rolling. Go left!

17:24.002 --> 17:26.505
- He's shooting at us!
- Lord, are we hit?

17:26.630 --> 17:30.217
Goddamn it, you'd know if we were hit!
Let's go!

17:34.096 --> 17:38.934
- There must be over $300 here!
- Help me, Jesus!

17:39.810 --> 17:43.731
Hold it! Don't touch that!
Lord, don't touch that! Now, look!

17:43.856 --> 17:47.693
Now, look! Hold it!
This is the humbug! This is the wrong...

17:47.818 --> 17:50.946
- Move it, sweetheart!
- Don't know why you wanna put me in jail!

17:51.072 --> 17:53.157
That man tried to rape me! Yes, he did!

17:53.282 --> 17:57.745
Why don't you let me go?
I've never been arrested before.

17:57.870 --> 18:00.331
I don't know why I did it.
I never done that before.

18:00.456 --> 18:02.541
I never... No!

18:02.666 --> 18:04.669
No!

18:15.471 --> 18:18.683
Watch it, Harry.
Grab that son of a bitch!

18:18.808 --> 18:20.434
I'm not a queer.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.603
Son of a bitch!

18:22.728 --> 18:25.398
Believe me, I'm telling you,
I never did it before!

18:25.523 --> 18:29.193
- What the hell was that all about?
- Probably homosexual panic.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.904
I've seen it before.

18:34.699 --> 18:38.661
- What is that?
- The boy suddenly realized who he is.

18:38.786 --> 18:42.081
He's confused and he's scared.

18:47.211 --> 18:50.047
Married six months,
I come home at 1:00 a.m...

18:50.172 --> 18:53.217
and find you alone with three men?

18:54.385 --> 18:56.929
I'm keeping your seat warm.

18:57.054 --> 19:01.350
- I lost $2 already.
- I didn't win it.

19:02.351 --> 19:04.979
Just a second, Helen.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.482
He's holding what? Thanks, junior.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.569
The kid said you gotta
fill an inside straight.

19:11.694 --> 19:15.197
- I'll bump the pot a quarter.
- It's a week till payday.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.366
It's your house.
Tell him the limit's a dime.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.036
The limit's a dime.

19:21.704 --> 19:23.080
What a night.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.916
1:00 in the morning,
clear, beautiful out,

19:26.042 --> 19:30.838
And the weather, the same for tomorrow,
Another beautiful day here in Los Angeles,

19:30.963 --> 19:34.300
The limit just went up to a quarter.

19:38.804 --> 19:42.808
- Had a bad night?
- There are no bad nights.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.269
Any good ones?

19:45.728 --> 19:48.272
Want to tell me some
cops-and-robbers stories?

19:48.397 --> 19:52.568
I just can't go home right now, Mom.
Adah's asleep, and the kids are asleep.

19:52.693 --> 19:57.031
- All normal people are asleep.
- Really?

20:02.244 --> 20:06.248
What did you do when Dad was out
on a house call in the middle of the night?

20:06.374 --> 20:10.086
Was he able to sleep when he came home
after putting somebody back together?

20:10.211 --> 20:14.298
- He'd just sit and play his violin.
- That's what I'll do.

20:14.423 --> 20:17.718
I'll play the bagpipes at 2:00 a.m.

20:18.135 --> 20:22.223
The kids are still too young
to run away from home, right?

20:24.350 --> 20:28.479
- What was I playing here?
- Rachmaninoff.

20:28.938 --> 20:33.150
- How do you remember?
- I remember.

20:33.818 --> 20:36.987
Why did I go from piano to bagpipes?

20:37.113 --> 20:41.367
Fifty generations of Highlander blood
won out.

20:41.492 --> 20:45.746
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.

20:58.092 --> 21:01.679
You know, I always hated
dissecting frogs in premed.

21:01.804 --> 21:07.018
But you should see me treat a mental case
on the floor of the Hollywood station.

21:07.727 --> 21:13.107
Ian, a policeman helps people
just as much as a physician.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.777
Sometimes you just see
more than one should, and then...

21:16.902 --> 21:18.863
What was it we used to say about Dad?

21:18.988 --> 21:23.576
"A country doctor dies
with a shoebox full of bills and..."

21:23.701 --> 21:25.453
"A trunk full of gratitude."

21:25.578 --> 21:29.582
There's no gratitude
in a policeman's trunk.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.753
- She's asleep?
- Just about,

21:33.878 --> 21:35.921
She's invited us to her house next year,

21:36.047 --> 21:41.218
- You going to be part of our little family?
- I don't think so.

21:41.344 --> 21:44.889
I've been alone all my life.
Never had no family.

21:45.014 --> 21:50.394
- Why is Greg always talking about family?
- He's real close with Mom, Dad...

21:50.519 --> 21:53.689
brothers, sisters. Real close.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.984
Sort of runs their affairs, always has,
even when he was in prison.

21:57.109 --> 22:01.447
- Yeah, I can see he likes to run things.
- Real smart.

22:01.572 --> 22:04.867
About the smartest guy I ever met.

22:10.122 --> 22:12.625
You know, Jimmy...

22:13.042 --> 22:15.461
you got a bold eye.

22:15.586 --> 22:20.174
I'm sorry if I was staring.
I just got out, you know.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.760
It's all right. I don't mind.

22:22.885 --> 22:24.178
In fact...

22:24.303 --> 22:29.141
when a woman's swelled up like this,
she appreciates a man's approving look.

22:29.350 --> 22:32.186
Especially a handsome man.

22:34.605 --> 22:37.650
You only part negro, or what?

22:37.942 --> 22:40.111
Baby, I don't know.

22:40.236 --> 22:44.198
I honest-to-God don't know,
and that's righteous.

22:46.909 --> 22:50.996
Did Billy really pat you on the fanny
like Greg accused him?

22:51.539 --> 22:55.626
- You scared of Greg?
- Why?

22:56.502 --> 23:01.841
'Cause if you're scared of him,
it'll only make it better.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.885
More naughty.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.097
More exciting.

23:08.472 --> 23:13.060
- How much pregnant are you, little mama?
- It's okay. I had kids before.

23:13.185 --> 23:17.231
Besides, it's all in the family.

23:21.652 --> 23:24.864
Nothing much,
I think I'd better change clothes,

23:24.989 --> 23:26.949
It's not going well, is it?

23:30.786 --> 23:33.497
See you around, Billy.

23:41.255 --> 23:46.635
I'd like to stab the paleface motherfucker!
You understand what I mean, baby?

23:46.802 --> 23:51.932
Damn, Jimmy, you're nice,
but can't you give a girl a little more?

23:52.058 --> 23:53.642
Talk about "wham, bam".

23:53.768 --> 23:57.730
Greg's going to pull up out front
just about any minute.

24:02.485 --> 24:05.363
- You're right. Here he comes.
- Jumpin' Jesus!

24:05.488 --> 24:07.865
You got any house spray? Anything?

24:07.990 --> 24:11.535
- House spray?
- Light a match! Something!

24:12.161 --> 24:15.956
Goddamn you, Jimmy. You...

24:16.207 --> 24:18.417
bastard.

24:22.254 --> 24:25.257
Had to dump that drunken Billy
on Fifth Street where I found him.

24:25.383 --> 24:28.803
He didn't want to be expelled,
but it's the only way.

24:28.969 --> 24:33.557
We're going to Las Vegas.
I need to get some new guns.

24:33.683 --> 24:36.686
Then, we'll do a little gambling,
and from there, who knows?

24:36.811 --> 24:39.980
Frisco? You name it, Jimbo.

24:44.527 --> 24:49.532
What the hell's the matter with you?
You keep sniffing the air like a bird dog.

24:49.657 --> 24:54.286
I'm catching cold, I guess.
My nose is running.

24:55.121 --> 24:57.748
You take care of yourself.

24:57.873 --> 24:59.250
Honey buns!

24:59.375 --> 25:02.753
Get ready. I decided to take
my family on a trip today.

25:02.878 --> 25:05.256
- Las Vegas!
- Daddy, Las Vegas!

25:05.381 --> 25:07.967
- Maybe I'll get another car.
- Daddy, Las Vegas!

25:08.092 --> 25:09.427
Yeah!

25:09.552 --> 25:12.138
- My lucky day.
- Daddy!

25:12.263 --> 25:15.891
How's it feel to be part
of a real family?

25:34.660 --> 25:38.122
- Want one?
- I ain't got no bread left.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.207
These kicks cost $35.

25:40.332 --> 25:42.460
Here you go.
This is one you should have.

25:42.585 --> 25:46.714
This suits you. I want you to have it.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.303
Nobody ever gave me a present before.

25:52.428 --> 25:54.305
Really? You city kids.

25:54.430 --> 25:57.224
You should've been from a small town
like Cadillac, Michigan.

25:57.350 --> 26:00.519
We were poor, too.
But gifts? My heavens!

26:00.644 --> 26:03.606
Family is what you need.

26:03.731 --> 26:07.526
I really like the watch.
It's a good watch for a cheap watch.

26:07.651 --> 26:12.323
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Wait till you see what else I got for you.

26:12.615 --> 26:16.452
That's real nice, too.

26:42.395 --> 26:44.730
Daddy!

26:44.897 --> 26:47.108
Yeah!

27:10.006 --> 27:12.967
Where the hell are you going?

27:13.217 --> 27:16.554
I was going over to Cottonwood Road.

27:16.679 --> 27:20.558
I know Bakersfield real good.
I swamped spuds here.

27:20.683 --> 27:24.061
I used to pick beans and grapes here,
just like a goddamn wetback.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.980
What's at Cottonwood Road?

27:26.105 --> 27:29.900
It's the black part of town, Greg.
There's women there.

27:30.026 --> 27:34.405
I was laying in bed listening to you
and your lady going at it.

27:34.530 --> 27:37.408
And I'm horny, you know.
You know what I mean?

27:37.533 --> 27:41.037
Turn off the keys,
and get out of the car.

27:49.712 --> 27:52.590
- We're going back to LA.
- L.A.?

27:52.715 --> 27:57.636
Jumpin' Jesus. One night in Las Vegas,
one night in Bakersfield...

27:57.762 --> 28:01.015
We're doing okay. We bought
this cherry little hot rod, didn't we?

28:01.140 --> 28:03.434
Bought us some presents,
and we had us some fun.

28:03.559 --> 28:07.605
Fun? I got to lose 10 nickels
in a goddamn slot machine.

28:07.730 --> 28:10.232
Greg, the last thing you said,
we was going to Frisco.

28:10.358 --> 28:13.235
L.A. is a two-hour drive
in the wrong direction.

28:13.361 --> 28:15.446
We're moving around
like goddamn gypsies!

28:15.571 --> 28:17.490
Jimbo, you just don't understand.

28:17.615 --> 28:20.326
We are going to Frisco,
but first we gotta go to LA...

28:20.451 --> 28:22.953
and get some money
by pulling another job there...

28:23.079 --> 28:24.663
so we can go to Frisco.

28:24.789 --> 28:25.956
You understand?

28:26.082 --> 28:30.086
We're just gonna leave the wagon here,
and we'll be back by midnight.

28:30.211 --> 28:31.420
Okay?

28:31.545 --> 28:36.092
What you gotta do is remind me to get
the brake lights fixed on that coupe.

28:36.217 --> 28:40.429
'Cause we can't get stopped by the cops
for faulty brake lights, can we?

28:40.554 --> 28:43.474
Me and my little honey buns
got you stirred up, there, did we?

28:43.599 --> 28:47.228
You know,
I'm kind of a virtuoso, sexually.

28:47.353 --> 28:49.939
That means that I'm a master
at pleasing women.

28:50.064 --> 28:54.151
She says that she could never imagine
herself with another man ever again.

28:54.276 --> 28:56.696
How about that?

29:24.306 --> 29:28.394
- Can I have some money for popcorn?
- Yes, you can.

29:28.519 --> 29:31.022
Let's see now.

29:31.439 --> 29:34.984
There you go. Kissy, kissy.

29:41.115 --> 29:44.326
- Toodle-oodle.
- Toodle.

29:44.994 --> 29:47.997
"Toodle." I love it.

30:02.136 --> 30:05.639
Why do I got to carry this gun in my belt?
Why not in my pocket?

30:05.765 --> 30:08.184
What if this thing goes off
and shoots my dick off?

30:08.309 --> 30:10.102
- That's all I need.
- Jimmy...

30:10.227 --> 30:12.897
Anyways, why do we got to
wear matching leather jackets?

30:13.022 --> 30:15.816
These goddamn, dumb caps?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.444
These things make
an impression on witnesses.

30:18.569 --> 30:21.197
They'll see this leather
and describe us as 6-foot-4.

30:21.322 --> 30:25.076
And that cap will hide part of your face.
I know what I'm doing.

30:25.201 --> 30:30.206
Jumpin' Jesus! We look like the
goddamn Katzenjammer Kids.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.708
Hear you were in the Marine Corps.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.586
Seems like everyone at the station
was a jarhead.

30:35.711 --> 30:38.255
- You, too?
- Communications.

30:38.381 --> 30:43.511
Yeah? So was I. The voice with a smile.

30:49.392 --> 30:52.436
The liquor store's back on Hollywood Blvd.,
for Christ's sake.

30:52.561 --> 30:55.564
I think the street dead-ends.
I gotta go back the way we came.

30:55.690 --> 31:00.194
Dead end. That's all
we ever run into is dead ends.

31:12.581 --> 31:16.794
- We should check these two.
- Yeah.

31:30.099 --> 31:34.145
- What's our probable cause?
- Try no brake lights.

31:34.270 --> 31:36.480
Let's be careful.

31:36.605 --> 31:41.736
Six-zebra-four.
Code 6 at Carlos and Gower.

31:41.861 --> 31:44.572
Six-zebra-four, roger,

31:51.078 --> 31:53.581
- Cops.
- Take it easy.

31:53.706 --> 31:58.044
- It may just be a traffic ticket.
- Jumpin' Jesus.

32:28.783 --> 32:31.452
- What's the trouble, Officer?
- Stay right there.

32:31.577 --> 32:36.916
I bet I know why you stopped us.
That little U-turn back there.

32:39.377 --> 32:43.798
- Would you mind stepping out of the car?
- Sure, Officer.

32:54.433 --> 32:56.769
Take his piece.

32:58.229 --> 33:01.065
He's got a gun in my back.

33:01.565 --> 33:04.151
Give him yours, Karl.

33:09.865 --> 33:12.785
Take his goddamn piece!

33:40.062 --> 33:42.648
Put your hands down.

33:44.567 --> 33:47.987
Put your goddamn hands down!

33:49.655 --> 33:54.702
Get in the car.
You, big man, get behind the wheel.

33:55.870 --> 33:58.456
You get in the back.

33:59.999 --> 34:01.751
Goddamn it, move!

34:01.876 --> 34:06.464
Put the flashlight on the floor and those
hands on the wheel where I can see them.

34:06.589 --> 34:09.550
Get in the back of the car.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.521
Shut the door.

34:25.065 --> 34:27.318
Head towards
the Ridge Route, Bakersfield.

34:27.443 --> 34:29.779
- All right.
- Don't break any laws.

34:29.904 --> 34:32.239
Don't try anything, or you're both dead.

34:32.364 --> 34:33.866
Jimmy.

34:33.991 --> 34:36.786
Keep your eye on him in the back,
and watch out for a tail.

34:36.911 --> 34:39.038
Let's go.

35:33.843 --> 35:36.303
You guys got any money?

35:37.054 --> 35:40.975
I've got about $8 or $9 in my pocket.

35:41.517 --> 35:43.728
I've got $10.

35:43.853 --> 35:46.313
Okay, here's the plan.

35:46.689 --> 35:49.692
I'm gonna take you guys
out on the Ridge Route...

35:49.817 --> 35:52.278
drive you up there on a side road...

35:52.403 --> 35:57.366
drop you off, and make sure you got
a long walk back to the highway.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.497
Do us a favor after you drop us off?

36:03.622 --> 36:06.751
Heave our guns in the brush
so we can find 'em.

36:06.876 --> 36:10.212
We pay for 'em out of our own pocket.

36:11.714 --> 36:14.675
Yeah, I think we can do that.

36:33.319 --> 36:36.113
Come on, let's go.

36:37.823 --> 36:40.326
Go on, let's move it!

37:00.971 --> 37:05.434
- Where does that road go?
- I don't know.

37:06.268 --> 37:10.815
It's a mid-canyon turnoff.
My wife and I go fishing there.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.316
- It's...
- Shut up!

37:12.441 --> 37:14.694
Shut your mouth!
I don't want nothing about it!

37:14.819 --> 37:16.445
Fuck the fishing and the lake!

37:16.570 --> 37:19.740
- And fuck...
- Jimmy, calm yourself.

37:19.865 --> 37:21.409
Let the man talk.

37:21.534 --> 37:24.578
He can't do anything.
You can start firing through the seat.

37:24.704 --> 37:27.998
Big man knows that if he even flinches
with that steering wheel...

37:28.124 --> 37:30.835
I can start jerking the trigger.

37:38.342 --> 37:41.262
Is this gun hurting your ribs?

37:41.846 --> 37:44.098
I'll manage.

37:44.598 --> 37:46.684
"Manage."

37:52.606 --> 37:55.609
Remember the Lindbergh Law.

38:21.510 --> 38:26.474
I've decided not to take your money.
I won't need it.

38:33.939 --> 38:36.150
Big man...

38:37.276 --> 38:39.320
how big are you?

38:39.445 --> 38:41.322
Not that big.

38:41.447 --> 38:43.783
"Not that big."

38:50.039 --> 38:51.916
Jesus.

38:52.041 --> 38:56.462
I got a brother as big as you.
My daddy's bigger.

38:57.755 --> 39:00.007
Not as tall.

39:02.009 --> 39:06.847
- What kind of pistol shot are you?
- Not very good.

39:10.601 --> 39:14.480
- Were you in the army?
- Marines.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.192
See any combat?

39:19.902 --> 39:22.238
I was in Korea.

39:25.741 --> 39:28.285
Well!

39:28.452 --> 39:31.497
I happen to be an expert pistol shot.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.667
In my business, you got to be good.

39:35.251 --> 39:38.212
I'll give you a chance
to see if you can beat me on the draw.

39:38.337 --> 39:41.132
I'll give you your goddamn gun back.
We'll have a contest.

39:41.257 --> 39:45.469
You better not, man.
My partner here is some shot.

39:45.594 --> 39:49.807
I seen him make a tin can jump
like a farm girl at her first dance.

39:49.932 --> 39:54.228
- Some shot, yeah!
- Yeah!

40:06.282 --> 40:08.576
Jimmy.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.204
You know the country around here.

40:12.329 --> 40:16.584
- Where's there a dirt road?
- Anywhere around here.

40:16.709 --> 40:19.420
You take the next one you see.

40:19.628 --> 40:23.799
Right here. Big man.

40:47.990 --> 40:50.618
This is farm country.

40:50.910 --> 40:53.371
Smell the onions?

40:56.540 --> 40:58.167
Just keep on going.

40:58.292 --> 41:02.088
You get this car stuck,
and you're a dead man.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.398
See that farmhouse in the distance?

41:20.523 --> 41:23.693
That's where you're gonna hike back to,
to make your call.

41:23.818 --> 41:26.612
- We gotta tie these guys up.
- "Tie these guys up"?

41:26.737 --> 41:30.741
They'll be here all night
and freeze to death, for Christ's sake.

41:35.788 --> 41:39.792
Stop the car. Easy.

41:44.755 --> 41:47.550
Turn off the headlights.

41:50.594 --> 41:53.514
This is where we let you go.

41:55.891 --> 41:59.228
You told me we was gonna be
in Bakersfield at midnight.

41:59.353 --> 42:03.149
At least you're right about one thing.

42:04.775 --> 42:07.069
Get out, Jim.

43:08.464 --> 43:13.177
That's the onions.
They make your eyes water.

43:26.732 --> 43:28.859
We told you
we were going to let you go...

43:28.984 --> 43:32.571
but have you ever heard
of the little Lindbergh Law?

43:33.489 --> 43:35.408
Yes.

44:26.250 --> 44:28.794
What's wrong with you?
He's getting away!

44:28.919 --> 44:30.755
Come on.

44:39.847 --> 44:43.851
All right. Here.
Listen. Don't waste bullets.

44:43.976 --> 44:47.813
I'm gonna drive down the road,
stop, wait for you to walk your way down.

44:47.938 --> 44:49.857
Good.

44:53.944 --> 44:56.530
Don't waste bullets.

45:30.856 --> 45:33.067
Jumpin' Jesus.

45:33.275 --> 45:35.319
Shit.

46:18.237 --> 46:20.322
Excuse me.

46:29.331 --> 46:32.877
Look, Officer, here he comes.
He's on foot.

46:33.002 --> 46:35.296
He can run faster
than this damn old tractor.

46:35.421 --> 46:38.007
Leave the lights on.

47:27.223 --> 47:28.808
Looky here, Officer.

47:28.933 --> 47:33.562
If you don't quiet down,
I'm gonna have to run off and leave you.

47:35.564 --> 47:39.402
This ain't my business nohow.
This is white man's business.

47:39.527 --> 47:43.948
This is police business.
I don't want to die.

47:44.073 --> 47:48.577
- What's your name?
- McFadden.

47:48.911 --> 47:51.831
Emmanuel McFadden.

47:54.041 --> 47:58.337
You go. I can't go.

48:05.928 --> 48:08.723
There's a farmhouse.

48:12.727 --> 48:14.854
It's out there to the left.

48:14.979 --> 48:19.817
Only one of us can take a chance
and cross in this here last field.

48:19.942 --> 48:22.528
'Cause there ain't no cover.

48:22.653 --> 48:26.615
You stay here and watch out for lights.

48:26.741 --> 48:29.160
If I yells...

48:29.285 --> 48:32.496
you come back to me here in the dark.

48:32.621 --> 48:35.207
You come back to me.

49:37.645 --> 49:42.733
Jimmy! Goddamn you, Jimmy!

49:43.776 --> 49:46.821
Goddamn you!

52:06.002 --> 52:08.129
Shit!

52:44.582 --> 52:49.086
Suspect may be driving 1967 Plymouth,
four-door, white over red...

52:49.211 --> 52:51.255
Edward-ocean-boy, 940,

52:51.380 --> 52:53.758
Use caution, Vehicle may contain 187...

52:53.883 --> 52:58.721
- They're long gone by now.
- Probably heading north.

53:02.725 --> 53:05.144
- What's that?
- Right model and color.

53:05.269 --> 53:10.566
- Wrong license though. Only one guy.
- Let's check it out, anyway.

53:18.115 --> 53:20.910
Goddamn it!

53:35.341 --> 53:37.385
Damn it!

53:44.642 --> 53:47.937
Good evening. Can I see your license
and registration, please?

53:48.062 --> 53:50.898
I wasn't speeding, was I?

53:56.946 --> 54:01.659
No, but this is a registration
for a Chevy wagon, Mr. Powell.

54:01.784 --> 54:03.994
No. I know what happened.

54:04.120 --> 54:08.416
I have two cars. A Chevy wagon, which
my wife drives and this one, which is mine.

54:08.541 --> 54:13.004
And I registered the cars the same day,
and inadvertently, I switched the...

54:13.129 --> 54:14.505
the registration cards.

54:14.630 --> 54:16.882
I'm sorry.
I hope you don't give me a ticket.

54:17.008 --> 54:18.509
We won't write you a ticket.

54:18.634 --> 54:20.594
Just to satisfy me,
would you open your trunk?

54:20.720 --> 54:22.513
Sure.

54:22.638 --> 54:24.849
Thank you.

54:32.982 --> 54:35.067
What for?

54:35.192 --> 54:38.779
Two men killed a police officer
out in those fields tonight.

54:38.904 --> 54:41.532
A car like this was stolen
a few minutes later.

54:41.657 --> 54:46.203
Killed a police officer?
Surely, you don't think it was me.

54:48.414 --> 54:50.624
It's stuck.

55:00.134 --> 55:02.720
The license said you lived
in Oceanside, Mr. Powell.

55:02.845 --> 55:04.388
Yes.

55:04.513 --> 55:06.849
My parents live there.
I live in Los Angeles.

55:06.974 --> 55:08.893
Just north on business.

55:09.018 --> 55:14.065
That's an irrigation shovel.
This car doesn't belong to any city man.

55:15.816 --> 55:20.237
You're making a big mistake.
I'm a taxpayer and a citizen.

55:20.363 --> 55:23.407
You're making one big mistake, pal.

55:48.349 --> 55:50.851
Turn around.

56:13.374 --> 56:16.210
I'm Sgt. Pierce Brooks...

56:17.586 --> 56:20.631
Los Angeles Police Department.

56:23.134 --> 56:25.071
I'm the investigator on this case.

56:25.196 --> 56:28.055
Yes, sir, Sgt. Brooks,
it's nice to meet you.

56:28.180 --> 56:32.143
Before we start, I want to tell you
right off that I'm happy to cooperate.

56:32.268 --> 56:35.771
My partner, Jimmy Youngblood,
fired that shot into that officer's face...

56:35.896 --> 56:39.775
then shot him again when he went down.
I wasn't even armed at that time.

56:39.900 --> 56:42.361
As far as finding Jimmy,
I can describe him for you.

56:42.486 --> 56:45.448
He's a negro, about my age and size.
Very nice looking.

56:45.573 --> 56:47.783
Youngblood may not be
his real name, but...

56:47.908 --> 56:51.829
he got out of Folsom Prison eight days
ago, so he shouldn't be hard to identify.

56:51.954 --> 56:54.665
Yes, he knows
the Bakersfield area real well.

56:54.790 --> 57:00.004
You might want to spread some mug shots
around an area he called Cottonwood Road.

57:15.227 --> 57:18.773
Get that son of a bitch!
Get him down on the floor!

57:18.898 --> 57:20.816
Come on, roll over, cop killer!

57:20.941 --> 57:23.778
- Move!
- Cop killer? Wait, please!

57:23.903 --> 57:26.739
I ain't no killer!
I never shot that man!

57:26.864 --> 57:29.825
I didn't shoot nobody! I'm just a thief!

57:29.950 --> 57:34.997
I've been a thief all my life!
I'm just a thief! I ain't no killer!

57:35.122 --> 57:37.917
They gas people for that!

57:40.127 --> 57:43.964
Ian will be grievously missed
by his wife, Adah...

57:44.090 --> 57:47.468
and his daughters, Valerie and Lori...

57:47.593 --> 57:50.638
and his mother, Chrissie Campbell.

57:50.763 --> 57:54.809
And he also will be missed
by his fellow officers.

57:55.518 --> 58:00.481
Ian James Campbell
has completed his tour of duty.

58:00.898 --> 58:05.486
May the love of God be with you all.
Amen.

58:10.408 --> 58:13.661
Detail, ten-hut!

58:14.036 --> 58:16.664
Present arms.

59:10.426 --> 59:13.137
Order arms.

59:13.763 --> 59:15.765
Ready.

59:16.182 --> 59:18.059
Aim.

59:18.309 --> 59:20.227
Fire!

59:31.447 --> 59:34.617
Left march.

59:36.243 --> 59:39.538
Parade rest.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:14.323
You know, Jimmy...

01:00:14.448 --> 01:00:19.954
Your story of the kidnapping and the ride isn't
really far off from Officer Hettinger's.

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:25.710
Thank you, Sgt. Brooks.
I thought maybe you didn't believe me.

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:36.429
The big problem, Jimmy,
is you left out a very significant detail.

01:00:36.554 --> 01:00:39.015
What's that, sir?

01:00:43.102 --> 01:00:45.646
After the officer
was shot down by Powell...

01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:49.650
someone, using Officer Campbell's gun...

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:52.778
fired four shots into his chest.

01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:02.329
Powell...

01:01:02.455 --> 01:01:07.918
- Powell had two guns, a gun in each hand.
- So did you, Jimmy.

01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:11.130
One of you had Officer Campbell's gun.

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:16.135
Four shots.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.637
Yeah.

01:01:22.725 --> 01:01:25.644
I guess I was too scared.

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:28.647
Yeah.

01:01:29.732 --> 01:01:32.860
I remember those shots.

01:01:33.527 --> 01:01:35.654
Down they went.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.406
Down.

01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:42.578
The fireballs went down into him, and...

01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:46.540
Go on.

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.834
It was like...

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:50.878
the hand...

01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:54.548
The Officer's hand kept...

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.677
reaching for my leg.

01:02:01.013 --> 01:02:06.102
It was jerking, like,
reaching for my leg.

01:02:07.019 --> 01:02:11.440
It jerked every time a bullet hit him.

01:02:15.528 --> 01:02:19.490
I sort of get a picture
of Powell shooting down.

01:02:20.241 --> 01:02:23.869
It would've been hard for Powell to fire
four shots into Officer Campbell...

01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:27.289
at the same time
he was shooting at the fleeing officer.

01:02:27.415 --> 01:02:29.375
The gun...

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:32.086
The bullets...

01:02:32.378 --> 01:02:36.007
We have all of the guns
and the shells and the slugs.

01:02:36.132 --> 01:02:39.385
And of course we have Officer Hettinger.

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:45.641
And what's he saying?
He don't say I fired those shots.

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:50.980
He don't say that, does he?

01:02:52.773 --> 01:02:54.942
Did you?

01:02:55.735 --> 01:02:59.447
Sgt. Brooks, I'm just a thief.

01:02:59.572 --> 01:03:04.410
I never hurt nobody in my life.
I'm just a thief.

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:14.170
Have you ever felt bad
when you did something wrong?

01:03:14.295 --> 01:03:18.174
- Like how?
- Has your conscience ever bothered you?

01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:21.802
Like feeling guilty?

01:03:23.804 --> 01:03:25.973
Mr. Brooks.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.642
I believe...

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.686
I think...

01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:33.898
that is something
that rich white guys dreamed up...

01:03:34.023 --> 01:03:36.692
to keep guys like me down.

01:03:36.817 --> 01:03:42.490
I honest don't believe there is
such a thing, such a feeling.

01:03:43.491 --> 01:03:45.076
Guilty?

01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:50.498
That's just something the man says
in court when his luck runs out.

01:04:04.762 --> 01:04:07.014
You want to talk to me?

01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:09.350
Yeah, Karl.

01:04:09.475 --> 01:04:14.939
You've probably had to tell the story
of the onion field to everyone today.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:18.734
They've got an idea downtown.
I think it's a good one.

01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:21.685
How about telling it to all
the roll calls for a few days...

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.690
and just getting it over with?

01:04:28.369 --> 01:04:32.039
- All the roll calls?
- Yeah.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:37.920
You know, there are questions.

01:04:39.797 --> 01:04:44.552
Like, why can't you say
who fired the last four shots into Ian?

01:04:44.677 --> 01:04:50.224
I know it was Jimmy Smith.
But I can't swear to it.

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:54.270
It was dark. I can't be sure.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:57.773
It doesn't matter because they're both
gonna go to the gas chamber.

01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:02.153
When you get in there, I just want you
to tell it in your own words.

01:05:02.278 --> 01:05:06.782
Tell how you guys followed them.
I mean, you can't bring Ian back...

01:05:06.907 --> 01:05:09.618
but if you tell them
the things you did wrong...

01:05:09.744 --> 01:05:12.705
the things that you wish
you would've done...

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:17.209
you just might save the life of
one of those boys. All right?

01:05:56.791 --> 01:06:00.086
- Hello, Sgt. Brooks. How are you today?
- Greg.

01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:03.214
I want you to say hello
to a couple of people.

01:06:03.339 --> 01:06:05.466
Let's take a walk.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.804
I got news for you.
Jimmy Smith's been arrested.

01:06:09.929 --> 01:06:14.684
That's his real name.
He's here in this building.

01:06:15.351 --> 01:06:18.312
Will you tell the same story
in front of him that you told me?

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:20.564
Why not?

01:06:56.392 --> 01:07:01.147
All right, this is Sgt. Pierce R. Brooks,
serial number 5702...

01:07:01.272 --> 01:07:04.692
Los Angeles Police Department,
Homicide Division.

01:07:04.817 --> 01:07:08.154
Present is my partner,
Officer Glenn Bates.

01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:14.410
It is 3:05 p.m., March 12th, 1963.

01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:17.413
We are recording
the statements of Gregory Ulas Powell...

01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:22.251
and Jimmy Lee Smith, who are together
for the first time since their arrest.

01:07:23.336 --> 01:07:26.672
Okay, Glenn.
You want to bring Officer Hettinger in?

01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:31.052
Officer Hettinger.

01:07:36.015 --> 01:07:37.224
All right.

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:41.062
Officer Karl Francis Hettinger
has entered the room.

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:43.105
Greg.

01:07:44.023 --> 01:07:47.777
Would you like Officer Hettinger
to begin or do you want to?

01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:50.321
I may as well tell you.

01:07:50.488 --> 01:07:54.784
I popped the first cap into that officer
and Jim popped caps after he went down.

01:07:54.909 --> 01:07:57.411
That's a lie. I never hurt
nobody in my life.

01:07:57.536 --> 01:08:01.165
You're a liar. You're just a fucking punk
and too chicken-shit to tell the truth.

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:04.168
- He's lying.
- Why would I lie?

01:08:04.293 --> 01:08:07.254
I'm going to the gas chamber.
And he's going, too.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.340
No matter who fired the last shots.

01:08:09.465 --> 01:08:11.342
Why the hell would I lie?
What could I gain?

01:08:11.467 --> 01:08:15.388
You buzzard. I'm putting a curse on that
unborn baby your lady's carrying around.

01:08:15.513 --> 01:08:19.265
It's gonna be born dead!
You hear me, sucker? Dead!

01:08:19.392 --> 01:08:20.935
You fucking...

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.188
All right, Glenn. Take Jimmy next door
and let him cool off.

01:08:24.313 --> 01:08:26.232
Greg.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:38.786
Thank you.

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:02.018
Did you take care of my woman?

01:09:02.977 --> 01:09:06.229
She said she was going home
to stay with her parents.

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:08.274
Okay.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:17.116
As I got out of the car,
I was trying to think up some alternative.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:22.662
I thought of handcuffing them but I realized
there was no way to go back for my girl...

01:09:22.787 --> 01:09:25.291
and get a running start.

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:30.171
I walked around the back of the car,
raised my gun and shot the officer.

01:09:30.796 --> 01:09:33.299
- And Jimmy?
- He shot him when he was down...

01:09:33.424 --> 01:09:35.718
at the same time
I was shooting at Hettinger.

01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:38.804
Surely, he saw it that way.

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:43.184
One thing, Greg.

01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:48.731
Would you object to talking to me
from time to time, to clarify details?

01:09:56.781 --> 01:10:00.534
I really like
to talk to you, Mr. Brooks.

01:10:01.369 --> 01:10:03.746
You've been very fair.

01:10:05.164 --> 01:10:08.459
- And I do feel a certain friendship...
- Greg...

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:12.755
- It's part of my job.
- More than a policeman doing his job.

01:10:14.215 --> 01:10:16.676
You show me consideration.

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:21.138
And I appreciate it.

01:10:25.935 --> 01:10:29.730
I wish my father had...

01:10:33.567 --> 01:10:36.404
- You must be a good father.
- One thing, Greg.

01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:38.114
Yes, Mr. Brooks?

01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:42.910
Did someone mention the little
Lindbergh Law just prior to the shooting?

01:10:46.455 --> 01:10:48.999
Little Lindbergh Law...

01:10:50.084 --> 01:10:53.129
No. Can't say as I heard that.

01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:57.633
- Do you know what the Lindbergh Law is?
- I have a general idea.

01:10:57.758 --> 01:11:00.344
What is your general idea?

01:11:04.932 --> 01:11:08.352
That kidnapping carries
capital punishment.

01:11:08.477 --> 01:11:10.771
You're wrong.

01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:16.360
The Lindbergh Law applies to
kidnapping for ransom with bodily harm.

01:11:16.485 --> 01:11:21.449
Up until the first shot was fired,
the little Lindbergh Law didn't apply.

01:11:21.574 --> 01:11:24.994
It wasn't a capital crime until then.

01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:28.873
I never shot nobody!

01:11:28.998 --> 01:11:32.001
- I've gotta take Jimmy back to his cell...
- I never shot nobody!

01:11:32.126 --> 01:11:35.087
I'll go to the gas chamber,
but I never shot nobody!

01:11:35.212 --> 01:11:39.091
Powell, you lying maniac!
I screwed your old lady, you hear me?

01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:41.510
I fucked the fat dog, you hear me?

01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:43.721
You lying maniac!

01:11:44.388 --> 01:11:48.559
"For all watches, citywide.
Memorandum Number 11.

01:11:48.684 --> 01:11:51.187
The brutal execution
of Officer Ian Campbell...

01:11:51.312 --> 01:11:54.273
proves that you cannot make deals
with vicious criminals.

01:11:54.398 --> 01:11:58.361
The individual officer enters a sacred
trust to protect his community...

01:11:58.486 --> 01:12:00.488
to lay down his life, if necessary.

01:12:00.613 --> 01:12:02.490
All men return to dust.

01:12:02.615 --> 01:12:07.286
The manner of a man's living and dying
is of paramount importance."

01:12:09.663 --> 01:12:13.125
All right. Come on, guys. That's enough.

01:12:14.877 --> 01:12:17.296
I say, "Balls."

01:12:17.421 --> 01:12:19.465
Sometimes I think there ain't...

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:23.552
two hairy balls left
in this whole police department.

01:12:23.678 --> 01:12:26.055
Who wrote that one? Billy Graham?

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:31.977
- Just a minute, now. If you disagree...
- I've been walking a beat...

01:12:32.436 --> 01:12:35.731
longer than some of these babies
have been on this earth.

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:40.444
And there was one thing
you might say was always kind of sacred.

01:12:40.695 --> 01:12:43.823
Police work is the kind of business...

01:12:43.948 --> 01:12:47.743
where only you know
what you should or shouldn't have did.

01:12:47.868 --> 01:12:50.621
Nobody else had a right
to question a judgment call.

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:55.126
- Just one minute about all this...
- I come up against...

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.211
some asshole one time.

01:12:57.336 --> 01:13:00.631
He had a .45 pointed at my belly.

01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:06.303
What I did was,
I looked in his mean little eyes...

01:13:06.429 --> 01:13:09.890
and I knew, as sure
as there's shit in a goat...

01:13:10.016 --> 01:13:11.934
if I didn't do what he said...

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:15.271
the coroner would be putting in
a special order for sawdust...

01:13:15.396 --> 01:13:18.357
to fill this here slop bucket.

01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:22.737
So I give him my gun real careful.

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:27.616
And I would've given him
my Sam Browne and my pants...

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:31.829
and my shit-stained skivvies,
if he'd asked me.

01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:35.791
- Look, men. The point of this training...
- The point is, Lieutenant...

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:40.046
that total authority belongs
with the cop on the street...

01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:42.465
when it comes to his life...

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:47.803
and the life of his partner,
which is the same goddamn thing.

01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:53.309
This is a panicky order you're reading.
And no matter how you read it...

01:13:53.434 --> 01:13:57.355
it's still criticizing these kids
Campbell and Hettinger...

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.733
for doing what they had to do.

01:14:01.233 --> 01:14:03.986
And what I did, too.

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:07.740
Good afternoon, Captain.

01:14:19.043 --> 01:14:23.923
Anybody who gives up his gun
to some punk is a coward.

01:14:24.965 --> 01:14:30.012
Anybody who does it can kiss
his badge good-bye, if I can help it.

01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:33.140
You're policemen.

01:14:33.265 --> 01:14:36.060
You put your trust in God.

01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:40.856
And when I returned to the...

01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:44.402
scene of the shooting...

01:14:44.527 --> 01:14:49.323
I found Ian lying face down in a ditch.

01:14:52.284 --> 01:14:58.040
There was a great deal of blood
on the ground.

01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:16.559
- Your Honor, may I approach the witness?
- You may.

01:15:28.237 --> 01:15:30.573
Officer Hettinger?

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:34.326
Would you identify the party
in this picture?

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:38.706
That is my partner,
Officer Ian Campbell.

01:15:39.999 --> 01:15:41.917
And you saw him in life.

01:15:42.043 --> 01:15:45.588
- Ls that correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:15:46.839 --> 01:15:50.885
And you saw him like this in death?

01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:56.057
Yes, sir.

01:16:08.736 --> 01:16:11.739
Karl, wake up! Karl! Stop!

01:16:11.864 --> 01:16:12.990
Wake up!

01:16:13.115 --> 01:16:15.576
- Wake up.
- Oh, God!

01:16:18.913 --> 01:16:21.207
Are you all right?

01:16:21.332 --> 01:16:24.335
You were having a dream.

01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:31.092
Honey. Every night...

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:58.828
They're just nerves. They'll go away.

01:16:58.953 --> 01:17:00.830
They'll go away.

01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:06.335
When they stop making me tell it
over and over and over and over.

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:17.304
I'm not those men. I know, but...

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:22.977
Karl, you have to tell someone
when things bother you.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:45.666
Moms...

01:17:51.005 --> 01:17:53.466
it'll go away.

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:59.096
I had a bad time.

01:18:03.309 --> 01:18:06.645
It'll go away when the trial's over.

01:18:16.364 --> 01:18:18.574
Don't worry.

01:18:30.795 --> 01:18:34.632
Your Honor, there is no meeting of the
minds between the defender and myself.

01:18:34.757 --> 01:18:38.219
I desire and insist and demand
that I be allowed to defend myself for...

01:18:38.344 --> 01:18:42.098
the duration of this trial, and I am
prepared to go forward immediately.

01:18:42.223 --> 01:18:44.058
If he can do it, why ain't I allowed?

01:18:44.183 --> 01:18:47.061
I would like to have the use
of the law library just like him.

01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:49.605
And there's something else
I wish to complain about.

01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:53.526
There's vermin in my cell. And the food
ain't nothing to scream about neither.

01:18:53.651 --> 01:18:55.069
Your Honor.

01:18:55.194 --> 01:18:57.780
This trial will drag on
all summer long...

01:18:57.905 --> 01:19:01.283
if they are allowed to continue
with their frivolous motions.

01:19:01.409 --> 01:19:03.786
Next thing you know,
they'll move for a mistrial...

01:19:03.911 --> 01:19:05.913
because the air conditioning went out.

01:19:06.038 --> 01:19:09.417
Your Honor, I will cite the
district attorney for misconduct...

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:11.377
and again move for a mistrial.

01:19:11.502 --> 01:19:13.218
Your Honor, this is turning
into a carnival and I...

01:19:13.343 --> 01:19:15.556
Counsel will be seated!

01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:27.560
I'm going to grant Mr. Powell's motion
to act as his own counsel.

01:19:27.685 --> 01:19:29.478
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:19:29.603 --> 01:19:35.317
I've decided to grant the defense a trip
to the onion field to reenact the crime.

01:19:41.532 --> 01:19:44.493
Will the bailiff
please turn off the light?

01:19:54.503 --> 01:19:57.673
We have now seen
what the onion field looked like...

01:19:57.798 --> 01:20:00.676
on the night of March 9.

01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:02.595
Your Honor.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.558
I believe, in this trial, we have done
everything humanly possible...

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:11.604
to accede to the requests
of the defense.

01:20:11.729 --> 01:20:15.024
Let the record show it's now about
six minutes after 10:00.

01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:18.694
We're going to take our adjournment
at this time until 9:30 a.m...

01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:23.657
when we'll reconvene in Department 104
of the Superior Court.

01:20:31.123 --> 01:20:34.919
I would ask your relationship
to anyone in this case.

01:20:35.169 --> 01:20:37.880
- I am your mother.
- Mrs. Powell.

01:20:38.005 --> 01:20:43.511
Could you tell us what your health
has been like in the past 20 years?

01:20:43.636 --> 01:20:47.640
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to
object to that as immaterial to the issues.

01:20:47.765 --> 01:20:51.227
This testimony will prove that during
the formative years of my life...

01:20:51.352 --> 01:20:54.271
the responsibilities
of raising children were placed on me.

01:20:54.397 --> 01:20:57.274
I am sorry, but I am going
to have to object to this.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.945
Why should I be placed at a disadvantage
because he chose to defend himself?

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.239
You're not being placed
at a disadvantage.

01:21:03.364 --> 01:21:06.409
It is not up to you to feel
one way or the other.

01:21:06.534 --> 01:21:10.621
Your Honor,
if Mr. Powell has anything to say...

01:21:10.746 --> 01:21:12.540
he should direct it to the court.

01:21:12.665 --> 01:21:15.501
If he wants to play lawyer,
he should act like one.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:18.170
I would cite the district attorney
for that remark.

01:21:18.295 --> 01:21:21.465
Just proceed, Mr. Powell. Just proceed.

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:23.592
Thank you.

01:21:23.718 --> 01:21:26.679
- Was I engaged in sports and so forth?
- Yes.

01:21:26.804 --> 01:21:31.100
We had a wonderful track event
in which you did very well.

01:21:31.225 --> 01:21:34.311
- Did you go to this track meet?
- Yes, I did.

01:21:34.437 --> 01:21:36.772
You participated in two things.

01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:39.650
You would've won
top honors in both of them...

01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:44.071
if you'd followed my advice,
which you didn't do.

01:21:44.572 --> 01:21:49.076
- One of them was a throwing thing.
- Softball. I took second.

01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:50.828
You won a blue ribbon.

01:21:50.953 --> 01:21:54.498
I took second in that event.
I won the blue ribbon in the relay.

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:58.044
You won a blue ribbon in softball.

01:21:58.627 --> 01:22:00.921
In the relay.

01:22:01.964 --> 01:22:06.344
Mr. Powell,
how long have you been a schoolteacher?

01:22:08.763 --> 01:22:11.057
About 17 years.

01:22:11.182 --> 01:22:15.978
Mr. Powell, during the time
that you knew me as a child...

01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:19.065
did you spend a lot of time with me?

01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:26.030
It was limited, my time.

01:22:26.155 --> 01:22:31.410
During the years of my mother's illnesses,
be they real or imagined...

01:22:31.619 --> 01:22:35.748
did I not take care
of my two sisters and a brother?

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:37.333
Yes.

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:42.004
And was I not the real head
of the family, even as a child?

01:22:43.297 --> 01:22:46.175
- Well...
- Strike that.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:51.681
When my mother got well, and tried
to take charge after all those years...

01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:56.602
is it not true, that I was doing a good job
of raising the children?

01:22:56.727 --> 01:23:00.773
And that you did not stand up to her
and tell her that in effect...

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:03.609
I was a better parent to those children?

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:07.279
- It...
- All right, now this has gone far enough.

01:23:07.405 --> 01:23:09.323
I object.

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.034
Mr. Powell.

01:23:12.827 --> 01:23:16.205
- Why do you want me to live?
- I strongly object to this.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:20.126
Mr. Powell, assuming that
two wrongs don't make a right...

01:23:20.251 --> 01:23:24.463
do you think it is right
for the state to kill me?

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.926
I want you to live.

01:23:30.219 --> 01:23:33.055
You're my son.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.317
Jimmy wasn't my real son...

01:23:45.443 --> 01:23:49.238
but he's the only son I'll ever have.

01:23:49.363 --> 01:23:53.701
Jimmy's mother took up
with this white boy and had Jimmy.

01:23:53.826 --> 01:23:56.495
She was only 13.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:00.207
She gave me a baby to raise up.

01:24:00.708 --> 01:24:05.713
Jimmy was never a mean child.
He never talked back to me.

01:24:05.838 --> 01:24:08.049
And I don't believe he'd do it now.

01:24:08.174 --> 01:24:12.428
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we've gone far beyond the question.

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:18.017
You mentioned that Jimmy Smith
was never violent, but...

01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:20.770
wasn't there an incident
as a teenager...

01:24:20.895 --> 01:24:24.732
when Jimmy Smith pulled a knife
on the truant officer?

01:24:24.857 --> 01:24:29.612
Mr. Schulman, Jimmy told me
that truant officer kicked him and hit him.

01:24:29.737 --> 01:24:32.823
- Jimmy was just scared, that's all...
- Leave her alone!

01:24:32.948 --> 01:24:35.951
You leave my nana alone!

01:24:36.077 --> 01:24:40.623
This ain't right!
My nana never had nothing!

01:24:40.748 --> 01:24:45.503
She never even said a swear word,
or took a drink, or went to a dance!

01:24:45.628 --> 01:24:50.424
You leave my nana alone!

01:24:50.633 --> 01:24:53.803
It ain't fair!

01:24:59.767 --> 01:25:03.646
Sadistically, Gregory Ulas Powell...

01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:08.234
led Officer Campbell to believe
that his life would be spared...

01:25:08.359 --> 01:25:11.654
up to the moment
he took deliberate aim...

01:25:11.779 --> 01:25:15.700
and fired one shot
into the officer's mouth.

01:25:16.951 --> 01:25:18.619
Jimmy Lee Smith...

01:25:18.744 --> 01:25:22.998
with revolting, inhuman barbarity...

01:25:23.124 --> 01:25:28.004
fired four more fatal shots
into the prostrate officer.

01:25:28.129 --> 01:25:33.300
Then they mercilessly stalked
the fleeing officer...

01:25:33.426 --> 01:25:37.304
who miraculously escaped
the cruel execution.

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:39.598
The evidence in this case...

01:25:39.724 --> 01:25:45.312
overwhelmingly justifies
the death verdict by the jury.

01:25:47.148 --> 01:25:52.945
It is the order of this court
that you shall suffer the death penalty.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.240
The penalty will be inflicted
within the walls...

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:58.451
of the state penitentiary
at San Quentin, california...

01:25:58.576 --> 01:26:01.912
in the manner prescribed by law.

01:26:31.776 --> 01:26:34.445
Get back! Back off!

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:37.198
Dead men coming through.

01:27:14.235 --> 01:27:18.364
Fuck off, you. I'll kill you!

01:27:19.073 --> 01:27:23.285
I'll kill you! You motherfuck! You fuck!

01:27:23.411 --> 01:27:27.456
Fuck! You motherfucking, lying...

01:27:28.874 --> 01:27:32.920
All right, assholes! Knock it off!

01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:38.175
I whooped him!

01:27:45.641 --> 01:27:48.310
Did you see it?

01:27:48.436 --> 01:27:53.232
He's just a fucking punk!
Without a gun, he's a pussy!

01:27:53.524 --> 01:27:54.817
I whooped him.

01:27:54.942 --> 01:27:59.613
Shut up, you goddamn nigger!
I'll tear your fucking head off!

01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:03.784
Damn!

01:28:03.951 --> 01:28:06.871
They're trying to shoot me.

01:28:07.038 --> 01:28:09.749
It ain't safe nowhere.

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:15.212
First shot is only a blank.
Just like a lion tamer.

01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:18.758
They want to kill you with cyanide gas.

01:28:18.883 --> 01:28:23.262
They like to see your throat and lungs
and belly on fire.

01:28:23.387 --> 01:28:25.723
Jumpin' Jesus.

01:28:25.973 --> 01:28:28.893
The sad thing is,
you might not have to die.

01:28:29.018 --> 01:28:30.019
What?

01:28:30.144 --> 01:28:33.522
There are cases pending
before the Supreme Court...

01:28:33.647 --> 01:28:37.234
cases that give us all hope,
especially you.

01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:39.779
You've got a gimmick going for you.

01:28:39.904 --> 01:28:42.073
What gimmick?

01:28:42.198 --> 01:28:46.744
If you get a new trial, you and Powell
split into separate trials.

01:28:46.869 --> 01:28:49.914
You can make Powell out
a devil to your jury.

01:28:50.039 --> 01:28:51.582
That ain't hard to do.

01:28:51.707 --> 01:28:54.460
You can subpoena him to your trial
and have your lawyer...

01:28:54.585 --> 01:28:57.672
ask him if he shot the cop,
or is he lying?

01:28:57.797 --> 01:29:02.301
He's gonna mess up any chance he has
by saying I didn't shoot the cop.

01:29:02.426 --> 01:29:04.136
He won't have to.

01:29:04.261 --> 01:29:06.931
He can stand silent
on the Fifth Amendment.

01:29:07.056 --> 01:29:09.392
It can't be used against him
at his trial.

01:29:09.517 --> 01:29:13.187
And he can scare the living shit
out of your jury.

01:29:13.312 --> 01:29:15.731
Other partners have done it.

01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:19.276
But first, you'll have to stop using Powell
as a punching bag.

01:29:19.402 --> 01:29:21.987
He can save your life.

01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:38.087
Here, kiss daddy.

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:40.715
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.050
Who's tough?

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.103
I think she'll nap now.

01:29:55.396 --> 01:30:00.776
- So tell me, how's the detective bureau?
- It's fine.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:04.947
Which means you're not crazy about it.

01:30:07.408 --> 01:30:10.369
Maybe I'm still a little young.

01:30:11.203 --> 01:30:13.497
Most of the guys there are old-timers.

01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:17.877
And they're jealous because
a younger guy gets a chance.

01:30:18.002 --> 01:30:21.881
It's like some of them think
I don't deserve to be there.

01:30:24.383 --> 01:30:27.803
Maybe they think I could've done more.

01:30:27.928 --> 01:30:32.016
You know, the night Ian was killed.

01:30:32.641 --> 01:30:36.437
That's ridiculous.
How can anybody say that?

01:30:37.521 --> 01:30:39.440
I hate that.

01:30:39.565 --> 01:30:42.610
They send everybody...

01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:47.907
to the academy for in-service training.
That's where they teach it.

01:30:48.824 --> 01:30:52.203
Teach you what
every policeman should do.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.582
They'll teach you...

01:30:57.166 --> 01:31:00.670
like I shouldn't have
given my gun up, and...

01:31:00.795 --> 01:31:05.132
things you should do,
and things I didn't do.

01:31:07.593 --> 01:31:09.095
Go on.

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.598
That's it. I don't know.

01:31:12.765 --> 01:31:15.601
I think I'm gonna like this job.

01:31:17.186 --> 01:31:20.731
My partner, Oscar, is the best.

01:31:22.983 --> 01:31:25.986
I think I'm gonna like working with him.

01:31:29.657 --> 01:31:33.994
It's finally a matter of knowing them.
These pickpockets are a closed fraternity.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.497
You get so you know them,
or you know the type.

01:31:36.622 --> 01:31:38.738
After a while, you get
to like the crazy job.

01:31:38.863 --> 01:31:41.102
Anything for a change, Oscar?

01:31:41.227 --> 01:31:44.463
You ought to see a chiropractor
about that sore neck of yours.

01:31:44.588 --> 01:31:48.509
It usually starts there, and then it works
its way into a vicious headache.

01:31:48.634 --> 01:31:52.388
- I know a good chiropractor.
- You know a good obstetrician?

01:31:52.513 --> 01:31:55.975
My wife, I think she's pregnant again.

01:32:00.271 --> 01:32:02.398
I can't remember his name.

01:32:02.523 --> 01:32:07.445
He used to work with a guy named Grimes.
Best pair of purse-picks I ever saw.

01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:10.072
We stay with him long enough,
he'll go for a purse.

01:32:10.197 --> 01:32:13.492
How about you circling over by the counter
in case he hits and runs?

01:32:13.617 --> 01:32:17.788
I need a new watchband anyway.
Maybe I'll buy one while I'm there.

01:32:52.573 --> 01:32:56.035
Welcome back to The Dating Game,
Connie, you now must make a decision,

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:00.414
The gentlemen over there
have done their best to win your heart,

01:33:03.417 --> 01:33:05.294
You said good-bye to the gambling man?

01:33:05.419 --> 01:33:07.546
He asked me
if I wanted to play some poker.

01:33:07.672 --> 01:33:10.091
Can you believe that?

01:33:13.594 --> 01:33:18.099
Yard time, coming in,

01:33:45.793 --> 01:33:49.088
Guard said I'm gonna die tomorrow.

01:33:56.429 --> 01:33:59.265
I'm gonna die to save you.

01:34:02.226 --> 01:34:04.270
I'm gonna die...

01:34:04.812 --> 01:34:07.648
like Jesus Christ.

01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:23.706
They'll sew him up
and put him in a straightjacket tonight.

01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:27.335
Tomorrow morning, he'll be nice
and healthy when they kill him.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:30.963
Smell the gas in the air
for days and days.

01:34:33.215 --> 01:34:35.843
Powell can save your life.

01:34:35.968 --> 01:34:40.306
We're all getting new trials.
Believe me.

01:34:42.558 --> 01:34:43.726
Lock up!

01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:46.562
Final lock up,

01:34:46.687 --> 01:34:50.858
Stand in front of your cell door
for the final lock up,

01:34:54.904 --> 01:34:58.032
Count time in the east block,
Count time,

01:34:58.157 --> 01:35:00.826
Turn on your cell lights,
Stand at the cell bars,

01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:03.704
Stand clear!

01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:22.473
Greg, please.

01:35:23.516 --> 01:35:27.061
I wanna be your...

01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:30.439
I'm sorry.

01:35:30.564 --> 01:35:33.192
We was friends.

01:35:33.776 --> 01:35:36.070
We was brothers.

01:35:38.656 --> 01:35:42.076
If I had only did what you told me.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.788
It's all my fault.

01:35:53.838 --> 01:35:58.092
Do you finally understand
that you shot that cop when he was down?

01:35:58.217 --> 01:36:01.429
No matter what your mind
lets you remember?

01:36:03.305 --> 01:36:08.352
I must've did it if you said so.

01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:13.232
I want to be your friend.

01:36:15.276 --> 01:36:18.320
We was like family.

01:36:53.356 --> 01:36:56.484
Just a minute, sir.

01:36:57.443 --> 01:37:00.988
You forgot your change.

01:37:01.197 --> 01:37:03.616
Thank you for coming in.

01:37:15.836 --> 01:37:17.880
Thank you.

01:37:21.842 --> 01:37:26.847
Do you want to sign your resignation
papers or fight the charge against you?

01:37:30.810 --> 01:37:36.232
- Sir, what if I don't sign?
- You'll be charged with shoplifting.

01:37:36.357 --> 01:37:39.485
The witness is positive,
so you'll possibly be found guilty...

01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:42.613
and get fired from the department.

01:37:42.947 --> 01:37:48.035
Then you might find yourself
in criminal court on a petty theft charge.

01:37:49.036 --> 01:37:51.080
Captain, what should I do?

01:37:51.205 --> 01:37:55.793
Officer, if you're guilty,
there's only one thing to do.

01:38:03.009 --> 01:38:05.428
Are you guilty?

01:38:54.685 --> 01:38:57.480
You're not a thief.

01:39:08.574 --> 01:39:11.285
You have no idea.

01:39:11.952 --> 01:39:14.872
You think that's all I stole.

01:39:17.291 --> 01:39:20.628
I've been stealing for over a year.

01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:26.801
I deserve to be in jail.

01:39:29.261 --> 01:39:32.973
You're the most honest man
I've ever known.

01:39:33.349 --> 01:39:38.771
I stole so many things.
Some I kept, some I just...

01:39:40.439 --> 01:39:44.151
I can't even remember
all the things I stole.

01:39:51.283 --> 01:39:53.577
I don't know a lot.

01:39:54.495 --> 01:39:56.664
But I know one thing.

01:39:57.498 --> 01:40:02.294
If you stole, it wasn't Karl Hettinger.
It wasn't you.

01:40:03.254 --> 01:40:06.632
There are reasons people do things.

01:40:13.973 --> 01:40:19.395
Maybe you could talk to someone else.
Maybe...

01:40:20.771 --> 01:40:23.441
a doctor could help.

01:40:26.402 --> 01:40:28.529
A doctor?

01:40:33.034 --> 01:40:35.077
For me?

01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:47.089
I can't afford a doctor for you and the baby.
How am I gonna afford a doctor for me?

01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:52.094
Helen, I don't have a job.

01:40:55.848 --> 01:40:58.851
Two years of pretrial motions.

01:40:58.976 --> 01:41:02.855
It's a war of attrition,
and the obstructionists are winning.

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.275
Our judge almost dies of a heart attack,
so we get a new judge.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.028
Start all over again.

01:41:10.613 --> 01:41:13.032
Two years.

01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:18.454
Phil, I've been on this case for six years.
There's no finality in the law.

01:41:18.579 --> 01:41:21.082
Our system of justice
is incomprehensible to the world.

01:41:21.207 --> 01:41:24.752
Mr. Halpin.
Could you please lower your voice, sir?

01:41:24.877 --> 01:41:27.672
I'm trying to prepare a new motion.

01:41:30.299 --> 01:41:32.385
Motions.

01:41:33.427 --> 01:41:37.807
Motions to exhume Campbell's body.
Motions to quash the jury panel for racism.

01:41:37.932 --> 01:41:40.434
Demands for softer beds.

01:41:44.939 --> 01:41:46.982
Pierce.

01:41:48.776 --> 01:41:52.363
What worries me is what
it's doing to me personally.

01:41:52.488 --> 01:41:56.117
I worked 15 hours a day
to get myself through law school.

01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:59.370
Now it just seems like...

01:41:59.787 --> 01:42:03.165
a silly thing to devote one's life to.

01:42:04.291 --> 01:42:06.627
Justice.

01:42:07.878 --> 01:42:10.965
That's not even an issue here.

01:42:11.966 --> 01:42:15.636
Your Honor, at this time,
the defense would like to renew...

01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:18.097
the motion to reenact,
film a reenactment of...

01:42:18.222 --> 01:42:22.101
I strongly object to this frivolous motion
to film a reenactment of the crime.

01:42:22.226 --> 01:42:25.521
These pretrial motions will go on forever
if you don't stop them.

01:42:25.646 --> 01:42:29.400
The district attorney's rhetoric
is delaying these proceedings.

01:42:29.525 --> 01:42:34.321
- If Mr. Halpin would please...
- Please! Please!

01:42:34.530 --> 01:42:36.365
And may I add, Your Honor...

01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:39.368
that Mr. Halpin said
he would knock me on my ass?

01:42:39.493 --> 01:42:41.787
- I didn't. I didn't say that.
- He did, Your Honor.

01:42:41.912 --> 01:42:46.751
And he directed his face
to my co-counsel and said, "Fuck you."

01:42:46.876 --> 01:42:48.794
Bailiff! Everyone, sit down!

01:42:48.919 --> 01:42:50.796
Did you see it? He struck my lawyer!

01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:53.215
You try that with me,
and we're going to war!

01:42:53.341 --> 01:42:56.135
- Order!
- He actually hit my counsel!

01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.637
Just a second.
You are instructed to say nothing.

01:42:58.763 --> 01:43:01.515
I would ask that Mr. Halpin
be arrested immediately.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.062
The court is calling a recess at this time.
The court is calling a recess!

01:43:06.187 --> 01:43:10.316
Your Honor, I would ask
that you have him arrested immediately.

01:43:10.441 --> 01:43:12.610
The court is calling a recess
at this time!

01:43:12.735 --> 01:43:16.489
I would ask that Your Honor
have him arrested immediately.

01:43:17.198 --> 01:43:20.826
The judge ordered us
to sit and be silent.

01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:23.412
Counsel for the defense refused...

01:43:23.537 --> 01:43:26.665
but said that he wanted it
read into the record...

01:43:26.791 --> 01:43:31.587
that he was deemed to have been
forced to sit and be silent.

01:43:32.755 --> 01:43:34.799
"Deemed."

01:43:35.549 --> 01:43:37.259
That's when it hit me.

01:43:37.385 --> 01:43:41.764
Physical fact is meaningless.
Lawyers can deem that fantasy is real.

01:43:41.889 --> 01:43:43.599
Lie is truth.

01:43:43.724 --> 01:43:46.435
Now Jimmy Smith's decided
he wants a brand new lawyer.

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:49.438
I guess it'll take a few more weeks...

01:43:49.563 --> 01:43:53.734
for the new lawyer to acquaint himself
with the case and...

01:43:57.655 --> 01:44:00.282
So I decided to quit the law.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.618
I'm finished.

01:44:02.743 --> 01:44:06.914
Why don't you take some time
and think about it, Phil?

01:44:11.002 --> 01:44:13.963
Campbell's forgotten.
He may as well never have lived.

01:44:14.088 --> 01:44:16.424
Hettinger's a ghost.

01:44:16.882 --> 01:44:19.635
Only the legal process has meaning.

01:44:20.094 --> 01:44:22.430
I've got to get away.

01:44:22.555 --> 01:44:25.266
You know what I was thinking?

01:44:26.308 --> 01:44:28.853
I was thinking
that if it were in my power...

01:44:28.978 --> 01:44:32.189
I'd release Powell and Smith,
drop all the charges.

01:44:32.314 --> 01:44:34.734
Let 'em walk.

01:44:36.777 --> 01:44:41.115
If only I could send some lawyers
and judges to the gas chamber.

01:44:48.706 --> 01:44:52.376
How about going out
for some Mexican food tonight?

01:44:53.127 --> 01:44:56.505
You can afford to support a husband
and children...

01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:59.550
and still go out for dinner?

01:45:03.763 --> 01:45:07.308
At least we don't have to worry
about any more kids.

01:45:07.433 --> 01:45:10.686
Not the way I've been
performing in bed lately.

01:45:11.437 --> 01:45:15.649
Karl, it's just temporary.

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:23.949
You think you should see another doctor
about those headaches?

01:45:25.159 --> 01:45:29.372
Maybe when this new trial is over,
things will get better.

01:45:36.671 --> 01:45:40.132
I better get going.

01:45:50.726 --> 01:45:53.354
Trial will never end.

01:45:57.650 --> 01:46:00.611
Trial is never going to end.

01:46:02.613 --> 01:46:04.448
Never.

01:46:35.730 --> 01:46:38.357
Please, shut up.

01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:51.991
Daddy!

01:48:57.705 --> 01:49:01.083
Yes, darling? I'm here.

01:49:03.586 --> 01:49:07.256
Daddy! The baby's crying.

01:49:10.634 --> 01:49:13.554
Go back to bed, darling.

01:49:16.223 --> 01:49:19.393
I'll take care of our baby.

01:50:08.901 --> 01:50:11.737
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:22.123
Hello, Karl.

01:50:22.623 --> 01:50:26.168
- Pierce, how are you?
- Getting older.

01:50:26.293 --> 01:50:28.754
Friend of yours.

01:50:29.588 --> 01:50:33.259
Emmanuel. How are you?

01:50:33.467 --> 01:50:36.012
I'm still digging in the dirt.

01:50:37.596 --> 01:50:41.100
I pass by Bakersfield
on my way to my fishing spot.

01:50:41.225 --> 01:50:44.228
I stopped by there about...

01:50:44.353 --> 01:50:47.231
a year ago, looking for you.

01:50:47.356 --> 01:50:51.485
I hear there was a white man looking
for me. I figured it was you.

01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:53.654
They want you now, Mr. Hettinger.

01:50:53.779 --> 01:50:56.449
How are they treating you, Karl?

01:50:56.574 --> 01:50:58.659
Fine.

01:51:01.662 --> 01:51:03.831
Just fine.

01:51:05.875 --> 01:51:10.755
How many times have you testified
to these events over the years?

01:51:11.005 --> 01:51:14.467
Maybe eight times.

01:51:15.259 --> 01:51:17.094
I don't quite remember.

01:51:17.219 --> 01:51:20.890
And when you testify, does it bring
the events back to your mind?

01:51:21.015 --> 01:51:25.811
Sometimes it fades away between trials.

01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:28.522
Sometimes...

01:51:32.401 --> 01:51:34.570
then...

01:51:37.531 --> 01:51:38.908
I'm sorry.

01:51:39.033 --> 01:51:42.661
Could you repeat that question,
please, sir? I can't...

01:51:42.787 --> 01:51:44.538
I'm going to renew my motion...

01:51:44.663 --> 01:51:47.416
that this witness'
entire testimony be stricken.

01:51:47.541 --> 01:51:51.879
Will counsel for both defendants
please approach the bench?

01:52:03.933 --> 01:52:06.018
All right, off the record, Your Honor...

01:52:06.143 --> 01:52:11.190
let me read a subpoenaed
psychiatric report on my chief witness.

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.859
"Mr. Hettinger is undergoing
severe depression...

01:52:13.984 --> 01:52:16.570
formerly masked by
a compulsive need to steal.

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:19.281
His former thefts were
obviously a crying-out for help...

01:52:19.407 --> 01:52:20.658
a desire to be punished.

01:52:20.783 --> 01:52:23.244
He's experiencing
overwhelming unconscious guilt...

01:52:23.369 --> 01:52:27.206
which he associates with not having
done his duty the night of the murder.

01:52:27.331 --> 01:52:30.292
Suicidal behavior
is a distinct possibility."

01:52:30.418 --> 01:52:32.253
Would the defense
like the jury to hear...

01:52:32.378 --> 01:52:34.880
what Mr. Hettinger has suffered
the past seven years?

01:52:35.006 --> 01:52:37.633
Your Honor, the question is
whether or not Hettinger...

01:52:37.758 --> 01:52:39.885
is mentally competent at this time.

01:52:40.011 --> 01:52:43.097
His testimony of seven years ago
is no longer relevant.

01:52:43.222 --> 01:52:45.266
You may step down.

01:52:49.937 --> 01:52:52.314
I believe he is competent.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.151
Your Honor,
I'm gonna call Gregory Powell right now.

01:52:55.276 --> 01:52:56.819
I object, Your Honor.

01:52:56.944 --> 01:52:59.488
He must not be allowed
to take the stand at this time.

01:52:59.613 --> 01:53:01.282
This is a jailhouse legal trick.

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:04.118
I know it, you know it,
the defense knows it.

01:53:04.243 --> 01:53:06.871
Mr. Powell will be allowed to testify.

01:53:06.996 --> 01:53:11.083
A trier of fact cannot draw an inference
about what a witness will or will not do.

01:53:11.208 --> 01:53:12.335
Call your witness.

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:16.547
- May I stand with my client, Your Honor?
- You may.

01:53:23.971 --> 01:53:27.058
Call Gregory Ulas Powell.

01:53:54.919 --> 01:53:57.713
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you shall give...

01:53:57.838 --> 01:53:59.799
in the cause now pending
in this court...

01:53:59.924 --> 01:54:03.928
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:54:04.053 --> 01:54:05.971
I do.

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.323
Mr. Powell, how many times
did you shoot Officer Campbell?

01:54:24.448 --> 01:54:27.076
I repeat my objection to this
as being asked in bad faith.

01:54:27.201 --> 01:54:30.204
Overruled.

01:54:42.925 --> 01:54:47.513
Based on the Fifth Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States...

01:54:47.638 --> 01:54:52.393
I refuse to answer that question
on the grounds it may incriminate me.

01:54:53.561 --> 01:54:58.816
- I have no further questions.
- You may step down, Mr. Powell.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.252
- How's my landscape designer?
- Your gardener is fine.

01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:46.048
Couldn't be better.

01:56:46.173 --> 01:56:48.634
The beer's nice and cold.

01:56:52.054 --> 01:56:54.390
I was wondering...

01:56:54.765 --> 01:56:57.685
if you'd mind if I took a real job.

01:56:59.311 --> 01:57:01.105
What job?

01:57:01.230 --> 01:57:05.276
I got an offer to go to work...

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:11.240
at a big, commercial nursery.

01:57:11.365 --> 01:57:13.451
You did?

01:57:19.373 --> 01:57:22.418
I'd have to supervise 30 men, so...

01:57:22.543 --> 01:57:25.046
Karl. It's terrific!

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:29.675
You could supervise 30 men or 300,
for that matter.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.138
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's in Bakersfield.

01:57:34.555 --> 01:57:36.432
Way...

01:57:36.557 --> 01:57:39.894
Near the onion field?

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:44.273
Near the onion field, yeah.

01:57:46.984 --> 01:57:49.320
It's real work.

01:57:49.445 --> 01:57:51.864
It's a good job.

01:57:56.077 --> 01:57:58.913
I think you should take it.

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:01.540
What do you think?

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:08.047
I think I should take it, too.

01:58:10.925 --> 01:58:15.304
Mr. Powell, congratulations.
I hear they gave you a parole date.

01:58:15.429 --> 01:58:18.015
- 1983, I hear.
- Yes.

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.935
Could you turn that down, please?

01:58:23.187 --> 01:58:26.899
Mr. Powell, could you talk to me
about my appeal?

01:58:27.024 --> 01:58:30.986
They say you got one of
the best legal minds in the yard.

01:58:31.112 --> 01:58:32.363
I'd be glad to.

01:58:32.488 --> 01:58:35.574
I could teach you some law,
if you were a willing student.

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:38.828
- You could?
- It would be my pleasure.

01:58:38.953 --> 01:58:42.998
First, I gotta put the finishing touches
on this letter to my family.

01:58:43.124 --> 01:58:46.752
Seems like everyone wants me
to run their affairs.

01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:50.464
You got a family, son?

01:58:52.967 --> 01:58:54.802
Very important, family.

01:58:54.927 --> 01:58:57.346
It's the foundation
and wellspring of all that's...

01:58:57.471 --> 01:59:00.766
productive and wholesome
in our social system.

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:10.776
Do you ever play that game?

01:59:10.985 --> 01:59:14.447
At my age? No way.

01:59:16.407 --> 01:59:19.535
I hear you
and your old friend Powell are...

01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.997
going to be getting out in a few years.

01:59:24.498 --> 01:59:27.585
Are you going to stay out this time?

01:59:28.210 --> 01:59:30.254
My man...

01:59:31.505 --> 01:59:34.675
I was born for a prison yard.

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:59.867
- How do you like your bacon, Mom?
- Served to me.

02:00:00.576 --> 02:00:03.412
This is my idea of Mother's Day.

02:00:03.537 --> 02:00:05.790
No kids...

02:00:05.915 --> 02:00:08.834
and a cook who's gonna
double as a dishwasher.

02:00:08.959 --> 02:00:12.004
This can go too far, you know.

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:14.256
Guess what?

02:00:14.382 --> 02:00:18.094
The other day,
I went driving by the onion field...

02:00:18.219 --> 02:00:21.472
and you'll never guess what happened.

02:00:21.597 --> 02:00:27.395
As I was driving by, this ad came
on the radio for the Black Watch Pipers.

02:00:29.397 --> 02:00:31.816
Can you imagine?

02:00:32.233 --> 02:00:37.446
As I was driving by,
bagpipe music came over the radio.

02:00:40.157 --> 02:00:42.034
And?

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.329
And it's...

02:00:45.454 --> 02:00:48.666
pretty nice music.

02:00:51.752 --> 02:00:56.257
If you give it a chance, lassie.

02:01:00.094 --> 02:01:03.347
Enough of this drudgery.
I'll drudge later.

02:01:03.472 --> 02:01:04.974
Come on.

02:01:05.099 --> 02:01:07.643
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

02:01:07.768 --> 02:01:09.645
- We're going to go swimming.
- No.

02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:13.774
- No! Karl! Karl, it's too cold.
- It's warm in the sleeping bag.

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:15.943
No!

02:01:16.193 --> 02:01:18.612
No! Karl, no!

02:01:22.283 --> 02:01:24.326
Karl, look.

02:01:24.452 --> 02:01:26.746
The little fish...

02:01:26.871 --> 02:01:29.331
They're kissing us.

02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:32.668
Those are bluegills.
They're just hungry.

02:01:32.793 --> 02:01:36.464
They nibble at everything
that comes into the water.

02:01:36.922 --> 02:01:42.261
- Damn it, Karl, I say they're kissing us.
- Okay, Helen.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.097
Okay, they're kissing us.

02:03:17.565 --> 02:03:20.693
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:03:20.818 --> 02:03:23.988
- You're a good piper.
- Thanks.

02:03:24.113 --> 02:03:27.324
I'm not that good.
I don't think I'll win a medal or nothing.

02:03:27.450 --> 02:03:28.784
You may.

02:03:28.909 --> 02:03:32.663
My son won a silver medal here once,
a long time ago.

02:03:32.788 --> 02:03:35.875
You must know about the bagpipes then.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.462
My people were from Scotland,
and so were my husband's.

02:03:39.587 --> 02:03:43.132
But I always wanted my boy
to play piano.

02:03:43.257 --> 02:03:47.970
- The pipes are so boisterous.
- No. That's the kind of brave music it is.

02:03:48.095 --> 02:03:51.098
I hope your son stayed
with the bagpipes.

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:53.309
Forever.

02:03:53.434 --> 02:03:57.146
I think I'll play the bagpipes
as long as I live.

02:03:57.271 --> 02:04:00.566
I think that's a lovely idea.
