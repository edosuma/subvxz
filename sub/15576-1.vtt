01:50.043 --> 01:51.943
Happy birthday.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.663
Who is it?

02:22.842 --> 02:25.106
- Mr. Jacobs?
- Yes?

02:25.278 --> 02:27.542
It’s me, Frank Hallet.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.437
Hallet?

02:40.860 --> 02:42.760
- Trick or treat!
- What?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.225
Trick or treat!

02:45.398 --> 02:49.300
It’s Halloween, young lady.
Why aren’t you out trick-or-treating?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.234
Oh, somebody’s birthday.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.670
- Whose, yours?
- Yes.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.141
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.371
And besides your birthday,
it’s also Halloween.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.106
Can I tell my father what you want?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.274
My name’s Frank Hallet.
Your father knows me.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.783
My two kids will be along.
They’re trick-or-treating.

03:07.954 --> 03:09.546
I'm just going along to make sure...

03:09.722 --> 03:12.156
...there aren’t any real goblins
hanging around.

03:12.358 --> 03:16.089
Like dirty old men who try to give
pretty little girls some candy.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.754
Tell your father you’ve got company.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.902
You better shut the door.
You'll let all the heat out of the house.

03:23.236 --> 03:26.330
I've seen you around,
but we’ve never met, have we?

03:26.639 --> 03:29.073
- You came over from England, right?
- Right.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.233
And they don’t celebrate
Halloween in England?

03:31.411 --> 03:32.400
No.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.101
It’s a big day here...

03:34.280 --> 03:36.942
...when all the kids get dressed up
in costumes and masks...

03:37.116 --> 03:38.777
...and go around to all the houses...

03:38.952 --> 03:40.715
...and shout, "Trick or treat!"

03:40.887 --> 03:42.411
And you’re supposed to act scared.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.717
And if you don’t give them a treat,
they pull some dirty trick on you.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.952
You mean, no trick-or-treaters
have been by here tonight?

03:49.429 --> 03:52.227
Well, there will be. My two kids
will be along here any minute.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.731
One’s a green skeleton and
the other’s a Frankenstein monster.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.070
What’s considered a treat?

03:59.939 --> 04:03.102
Candy, popcorn, gum,
anything like that.

04:03.876 --> 04:06.106
Would they like a piece of cake?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.405
But that’s your birthday cake.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.250
You shouldn’t cut it just for them.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.620
Bravo.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.656
Where’s your mother?

04:19.826 --> 04:21.589
My mother’s dead.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.424
But your father’s here.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.598
He smokes French cigarettes, right?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.296
Am I right about
the French cigarettes?

04:30.470 --> 04:31.801
Yeah.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.736
Where is he, upstairs?

04:34.907 --> 04:36.374
Your father’s upstairs?

04:36.542 --> 04:40.273
- No, he’s in his study, working.
- Oh, yes. He’s a poet.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.141
My mother says he’s a poet.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.307
And whatever my mother says
automatically has to be true.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.316
It wouldn’t dare not be.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.479
My mother’s the lady that leased
this place to you and your father.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.028
Oh, that’s great.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.323
The kids are gonna love this.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.436
Are my hands cold?

05:13.246 --> 05:14.907
You’re 13?

05:15.682 --> 05:17.980
I counted 13 candles.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.213
- That’s all I had.
- You’re 14?

05:24.357 --> 05:26.018
L"II bet you write poetry too.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.384
I'd like to read
your poems sometime.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.299
Just you and your father live here?
Just you two?

05:35.468 --> 05:37.060
Yeah.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.397
And I'll bet this is
his favorite chair, isn’t it?

05:44.544 --> 05:45.909
Yeah.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.308
What’ve you got there?
What is that, a hamster?

05:50.483 --> 05:52.417
Oh, let me see.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.812
Well, I just wanna see.

05:57.223 --> 05:58.884
What’s his name?

05:59.826 --> 06:02.590
Oh, come on. He’s gotta have a name.
Tell me his name.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.024
Gordon.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.598
Gordon? He’s cute.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.196
Shouldn’t you tell
your father I'm here?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.430
No, not when he’s working.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.631
You’re a very pretty girl,
you know that?

06:17.243 --> 06:18.904
Pretty eyes.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.973
Pretty hair.

06:26.018 --> 06:30.182
Pretty girl like you,
and your birthday and all...

06:30.656 --> 06:32.385
No boyfriend?

06:34.794 --> 06:36.955
Come on,
I’ll bet you got a boyfriend.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.298
L"II bet you got lots of boyfriends,
pretty girl like you.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.362
It’s okay. It’s all right. Relax.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.596
I get to spank you on your birthday.
That’s a custom here.

06:47.006 --> 06:50.032
Yes, you get one spank for every year,
and one to grown on.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.733
See, you got off easy.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.708
Now, don’t get mad.
It’s just a game.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.939
It’s just a silly birthday game,
that’s all.

06:56.115 --> 06:59.016
You don’t think I was trying to
be fresh, do you? Don’t be silly.

06:59.185 --> 07:02.416
I’ve got two kids of my own, you know,
and they'll be along any minute.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.079
Here they come now, even.
Well, I’m off.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.192
Thank you for the treats.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.988
No trick on you tonight.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.089
Hello, boys!

07:13.266 --> 07:15.564
Tell your father I’m sorry
I missed him. Good night.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.293
Hey, I've got some treats for you.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.803
There we go.
One for you and one for you.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.966
Come on, boys, let’s go.
Happy birthday!

07:25.178 --> 07:28.113
Come on, boys, let’s go, go, go.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.349
Jacobs, Lester and Jacobs, Rynn.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.051
That’s me.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.789
It’s what you call a joint account.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.156
Sign here, please.

08:21.901 --> 08:25.428
- Have you got your key?
- Right here.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.514
You can take it into
one of these booths.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.609
Yes, I know. Thank you.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.883
Sign your name again, please.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.126
She’s only 13.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.458
My father has an account here.
Lester Jacobs.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.940
Next, please?

09:06.445 --> 09:09.778
Could I have that paper
with my signature on it, please?

09:11.617 --> 09:13.414
Thank you.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.005
Crab apples. No grapes this year.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.047
How are you two
getting along out here?

10:51.350 --> 10:54.444
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.549
You do remember me?

10:56.722 --> 10:58.622
I’m Cora Hallet.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.986
Your father leased
this house from me.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.388
Yeah, I remember you.

11:03.229 --> 11:06.460
- Where did this come from?
- It’s my father’s.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.661
This belongs here.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.903
That table and braided rug
belong over there.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.445
Poets aren’t supposed to live
like other people, is that it?

11:27.553 --> 11:30.351
I keep forgetting to ask him
to autograph one for me.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.923
"I love you." Signed, "Father."

11:34.627 --> 11:36.595
Nice and simple.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.464
We don’t see much
of you two in the village.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.899
Not even at the market.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.504
Well, the market does deliver.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.339
If one can afford it.

11:48.507 --> 11:51.067
Do you want me to give
a message to my father?

11:51.243 --> 11:54.178
Such a shame about those grapes.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.875
Nobody bothered to spray.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.142
I can give my father any message.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.479
I came for the jelly glasses.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.121
For as long as I can remember...

12:03.289 --> 12:05.814
...the owners and I have made
jelly out of those grapes.

12:05.991 --> 12:08.186
The glasses are in the cellar.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.427
Your father’s not home?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.329
No, he isn’t.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.968
Oh, that’s too bad.

12:18.137 --> 12:22.198
I was having a little gathering
at my house and I was hoping that...

12:23.409 --> 12:24.967
Is he in the village?

12:25.211 --> 12:27.179
No, he’s in New York.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.808
When I was outside,
I could have sworn I heard voices.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.649
Hebrew?

12:38.324 --> 12:41.350
I should think French
would be more help.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.358
Or Italian.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.694
Lord knows there are enough of them
around these days to speak it with.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.427
Are you sure you don’t want
to give my father a message?

12:50.603 --> 12:54.972
So many outsiders
in the village these days.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.106
Oh, from London.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.369
- Yeah.
- I adore crosswords.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.445
Well, you can take it with you
if you like.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.345
- But your father’s doing it.
- I’m doing it.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.920
And Hebrew.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.216
My son’s children tell me...

13:12.391 --> 13:15.087
...you gave them some birthday cake
the other night.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.558
He came inside the house?

13:18.097 --> 13:20.691
- My son?
- Yeah, he came inside.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.996
Your father?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.532
Your father was here that evening?

13:25.805 --> 13:26.931
He was in his study.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.973
When he’s working,
he can’t be disturbed.

13:30.476 --> 13:34.071
Since that evening,
my son’s been back?

13:34.513 --> 13:35.810
No.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.415
- Not been back at all?
- No.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.545
If my son should come back
and your father isn’t here...

13:43.722 --> 13:47.283
...it might be better
if you didn’t let him in.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.861
Well, he didn’t ask
my permission the first time.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.259
I hope you didn’t intend that
to sound so rude.

13:55.534 --> 13:58.731
L"II tell my father you said not to let
your son inside the door.

13:58.904 --> 14:00.599
That won’t be necessary.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.241
Maybe I don’t understand
what you want, Mrs. Hallet.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.067
One thing I certainly do not want...

14:05.244 --> 14:08.680
...is to go on and on about something
that doesn’t matter in the slightest.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.783
I came for jelly glasses.
We'll get them now.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.419
Your son says I have pretty hair.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.385
Did he tell you that?

14:18.457 --> 14:20.789
We’ll get the glasses now.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.293
They’re in the cellar.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.725
We’ll move this table...

14:25.898 --> 14:28.128
...so I can get the rug up
and raise the trap door.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.167
My father and I like the table
where it is.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.929
But the glasses are in the cellar.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.705
L"II get them for you later,
Mrs. Hallet.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.269
Move the table.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.378
This is my house.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.605
You are an extraordinarily
rude little girl...

14:42.781 --> 14:44.772
...who’s going to do exactly as I say.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.180
Last week you took
the only good grapes we have...

14:48.354 --> 14:49.616
...and now the crab apples.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.279
And you never asked if you might.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.256
And today you just walked
bang into my house!

14:55.427 --> 14:57.486
- This is not your house!
- My house!

14:57.663 --> 14:59.028
Leased.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.098
You’re 13.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.162
Why aren’t you in school?

15:05.437 --> 15:08.270
Thirteen means I have no rights,
is that it?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.676
Thirteen means
you should be in school.

15:14.213 --> 15:17.478
- Look at me when I speak to you.
- I study at home.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.515
It so happens I’m a member
of the school board.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.586
When we meet on Monday,
they’ll be very interested in your case.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.919
Now, where’s your father?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.653
- I told you, he’s in New York.
- Exactly where in New York?

15:30.829 --> 15:32.854
He’s having lunch
with his publisher.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.761
I want the publisher’s
telephone number.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.732
- I don’t have it.
- The publisher’s name?

15:45.544 --> 15:47.409
This one’s London.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.715
Your father will telephone me the
moment he comes back, understood?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.550
This is my house.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.908
What are you doing here?

16:58.083 --> 17:00.381
It’s Saturday afternoon.
Why aren’t you at the game?

17:00.552 --> 17:03.020
I’ve gotta do this report
on government...

17:03.188 --> 17:05.986
...and I need to know when
the school board holds its meetings.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.921
Well, would it help you to visit one?

17:08.594 --> 17:12.791
No. Actually, all I really need
to know is when it meets.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.227
Twice monthly.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.396
Someone told me
it’s meeting this Monday.

17:16.568 --> 17:20.527
No, the board meets again
a week from Thursday.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.808
These are the bylaws.

17:23.976 --> 17:27.412
- If you need any further help...
- No. This is super. Thank you.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.707
But you shouldn’t be working now.
You should be at the ball game.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.943
The Wildcats need
all the help they can get.

17:34.353 --> 17:37.447
Whose class are you doing
the paper for?

17:37.723 --> 17:41.056
Excuse me. Maybe I can
get there by halftime.

17:45.864 --> 17:50.767
You’re a liar, Mrs. Hallet.
You’re a liar.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.612
Rynn, where you going?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.676
Back home.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.909
If you can wait a second,
I’ll give you a lift.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.781
No, really. I’m fine.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.979
I was hoping maybe you and...

18:12.157 --> 18:13.351
Some other time, then.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.016
Could you give your mother
a message for me?

18:16.195 --> 18:17.890
Tell her I have those jelly glasses...

18:18.063 --> 18:20.497
...and any time she wants to come by,
they’ll be there.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.395
I can come by later myself,
if you like.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.135
I think it'd be better if she came.
My father wants to talk to her.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.829
Yeah, I’ll tell her.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.342
- Everything all right, miss?
- Fine, officer.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.970
I mean, he wasn’t bothering you,
was he?

18:35.147 --> 18:36.136
Mr. Hallet?

18:36.315 --> 18:38.715
Your folks let you wander
around town by yourself?

18:38.884 --> 18:42.183
I live with my father. He lets me
come into town when I want.

18:42.354 --> 18:45.323
- What’s your name?
- Rynn Jacobs.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.215
Do you have a name, officer?

18:47.392 --> 18:50.725
Oh, sure, yeah. Sorry.
The name’s Miglioriti.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.228
- Miglioriti.
- Yeah. You got it.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.865
But call me Ron.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.695
Miglioriti. That’s a nice name.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.235
It’s Italian.

18:59.404 --> 19:01.167
It’s hard for most Americans.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.241
And have the Miglioritis been living
in this town a long time?

19:04.409 --> 19:07.503
Hey, you sound like you’ve been
talking to Mrs. Hallet.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.341
To her, if you weren’t on
the first ship that put in here...

19:10.516 --> 19:11.983
...you'll always be an immigrant.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.085
I guess we’re the newest,
me and my father.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.153
You’ve been here, what,
a couple of months?

19:16.321 --> 19:17.913
Yeah, about that.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.082
Like it?

19:20.359 --> 19:24.489
- Is school okay?
- Yeah, it’s okay.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.323
- Yeah, being new isn’t easy.
- There’s the lane.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.933
Around here, folks can be
a little cold at first...

19:30.102 --> 19:34.163
...but when you’ve been here longer,
they’ll seem even colder.

19:37.342 --> 19:38.969
Thanks for the ride.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.669
Maybe I could have
a talk with your father.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.941
- Why?
- Nothing to worry your head about.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.779
Well, I can’t disturb him
when he’s working.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.114
Yeah, well, let’s see if he is.

19:54.760 --> 19:58.321
Sorry, he’s working.
He’s translating some Russian poetry.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.398
When that door’s locked,
I can’t bother him.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.969
I suspect the only reason Mrs. Hallet
lets us into her village...

20:06.138 --> 20:07.867
...is because my father’s a poet.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.632
Mrs. Hallet loves poets.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.370
That’s one of his books over there.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.203
- He wrote that, huh?
- Yeah.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.813
Want him to sign a copy for you?

20:16.982 --> 20:20.145
Yeah, sure. I never met a real poet.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.117
I mean, look, don’t laugh at me...

20:23.288 --> 20:25.722
...but I can’t believe
people like poetry.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.327
I’m not talking about that
birthday-card stuff, but real poetry.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.556
I mean, when it doesn’t even rhyme.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.289
No, I’m not laughing at you.

20:34.466 --> 20:37.128
My father says that most people
who say they like poetry...

20:37.302 --> 20:39.395
...only pretend to like it.
You’re honest.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.269
He’s your favorite poet, huh?

20:41.440 --> 20:44.238
No. He’s my father.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.967
Emily Dickinson’s my favorite.

20:47.312 --> 20:49.143
Emily Dickinson, yeah.

20:49.648 --> 20:53.607
You know, it can be pretty nice here
in the village once you get used to it.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.980
And just don’t let Mrs. Hallet
hassle you.

20:56.154 --> 20:57.781
Her son says I’m a pretty girl.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.152
That what he said?

21:00.659 --> 21:02.718
What is he, a pervert?

21:05.197 --> 21:08.030
I guess that means little girls
shouldn’t accept candy from him.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.033
- Not if they’re smart little girls.
- Don’t worry, I won’t.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.137
I’m glad you came by, though.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.170
Yeah, me too, I’m glad, but...

21:15.841 --> 21:17.206
Do you like turkey?

21:17.376 --> 21:19.606
Well, to tell you the truth, no.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.645
You know, birds are reptiles
from way back.

21:22.814 --> 21:23.803
Biologically.

21:23.982 --> 21:27.440
Yeah, well, then I guess you don’t
wanna buy a raffle ticket, huh?

21:27.619 --> 21:30.452
You mean if we buy a raffle ticket,
we might win a turkey?

21:30.622 --> 21:33.147
For Thanksgiving.
Yeah, a big 20-pounder.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.555
- A big turkey, huh?
- Yeah.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.592
Yeah, all right, we'll take two tickets.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.134
Two dollars.

21:50.309 --> 21:55.440
Look, I really hate to do this,
you know? I mean...

21:55.614 --> 21:57.206
It’s all right.

21:58.216 --> 22:00.548
Hold on. Here.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.882
There’s one for you,
and one for your father.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.251
And we’ll see which one’s
the lucky one, okay?

22:06.425 --> 22:07.824
All right.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.189
- Thank your father too.
- Sure.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.736
- See you around.
- Bye-bye.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.536
Hello?

23:30.842 --> 23:34.642
- I may come in.
- I invited you, Mrs. Hallet.

23:34.813 --> 23:37.179
We had a meeting
of the school board this morning.

23:37.349 --> 23:39.840
I spoke to them about you.

23:40.018 --> 23:44.216
I must say, when they heard about
your case, they were very interested.

23:44.389 --> 23:47.187
I was just about to put a kettle on.
Would you like some tea?

23:47.359 --> 23:49.987
Very interested in your case.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.356
You don’t wanna hear
what they said?

23:53.532 --> 23:56.365
As for tea, Darjeeling or Earl Grey?

23:57.569 --> 24:00.629
I came here prepared
to forget about yesterday...

24:00.806 --> 24:04.765
...but I must say, I don’t care for
your tone any better today.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.843
Well, then it’s up to me to apologize.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.644
What I find particularly surprising...

24:09.815 --> 24:12.909
...is that most boys and girls
who are educated in England...

24:13.084 --> 24:14.642
...are so well-behaved.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.678
What did you decide for the tea?

24:16.855 --> 24:20.256
Not a glass of that thick,
sweet wine...

24:20.425 --> 24:23.952
...you people use
in your religious rituals?

24:24.129 --> 24:26.859
Or aren’t you old enough
to drink wine?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.199
You told my son 14,
you told me 13.

24:29.367 --> 24:31.858
Now, which is it to be?

24:32.037 --> 24:35.438
- Thirteen.
- And brilliant.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.972
As so many of your people are.

24:40.412 --> 24:44.075
Mrs. Hallet, will you please accept my
apology for what happened yesterday?

24:44.549 --> 24:46.881
I’m afraid it isn’t that simple.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.345
You told my son your father
wished to speak to me?

24:51.490 --> 24:55.984
I certainly wish to speak to him.
Call him.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.788
Well, he’s translating right now.

24:57.963 --> 25:01.057
I couldn’t disturb him
even for Officer Miglioriti.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.327
Officer Miglioriti works
for people like me.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.161
In case you’re wondering...

25:06.338 --> 25:09.364
...I’m waiting right here
until you do call your father.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.368
You never answered about the tea.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.671
I can’t imagine what made any of us
think you could be happy here.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.939
My father and I love this house.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.616
No, I think we’ll make other plans.

25:20.785 --> 25:23.583
Our lease is for three years.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.521
Leases have known to be broken.

25:27.759 --> 25:31.195
Unless, of course, your father and I
could come to some understanding.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.126
And what would that be,
Mrs. Hallet?

25:33.298 --> 25:36.199
There it is again,
that continual mocking tone.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.536
And don’t look at me with
those hurt eyes...

25:38.703 --> 25:40.500
...and pretend you’ve been
misunderstood.

25:40.672 --> 25:44.267
You and I both know
you say exactly what you intend.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.236
Here are your glasses, Mrs. Hallet.

25:50.415 --> 25:52.610
I’m being dismissed?

25:54.619 --> 25:56.644
Call your father. Right this minute.

25:56.821 --> 25:58.516
Not when he’s working.

25:59.057 --> 26:03.084
You and I know perfectly well
he isn’t there.

26:03.461 --> 26:06.726
Go in that study, Mrs. Hallet,
and I tell my father about your son.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.296
- My son?
- About Halloween.

26:10.468 --> 26:11.958
I haven’t told my father yet.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.831
- Told your father what?
- What happened here.

26:16.007 --> 26:18.407
Everybody in the village
knows about your son.

26:19.210 --> 26:22.976
Miglioriti. He’s a liar.
He hates my son.

26:23.148 --> 26:26.606
Did he tell you he had an affair with my
son’s wife before they were married?

26:26.785 --> 26:30.016
I even had to ask him why the police
don’t do anything about it.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.949
Why should they do anything?

26:33.258 --> 26:35.658
When your son gives candy
to pretty little girls?

26:38.463 --> 26:40.931
Your jelly glasses, Mrs. Hallet.

26:41.633 --> 26:44.158
- You are gonna get out of this house.
- My house!

26:44.336 --> 26:47.134
With or without your father!

26:48.940 --> 26:52.398
Sure, this is a lonely place.
Often I’m alone.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.135
That doesn’t worry me, Mrs. Hallet.

26:54.312 --> 26:58.078
And if it worries you, that’s a problem
you’d better take up with your son.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.609
Goddamn you!

27:05.757 --> 27:07.748
No seals.

27:08.860 --> 27:12.125
Without rubber seals,
these glasses are worthless.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.561
The seals are in the cellar.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.635
And this time, don’t you dare
tell me to come back later.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.862
Get out of my house!

27:21.039 --> 27:23.599
I’m warning you, Mrs. Hallet.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.209
Get out of my house!

27:32.684 --> 27:35.244
Mrs. Hallet, I’m warning you!

31:59.717 --> 32:03.084
Hi. You been driving long?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.518
How come you’re in this car?

32:06.691 --> 32:11.526
- How come you’re dressed like that?
- Because I’m a magician.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.961
And what’s that, your magic wand?

32:14.132 --> 32:18.262
Oh, it’s my cane. I’m a cripple.

32:18.736 --> 32:22.194
- I guess I should say I’m sorry.
- Why? It’s not your fault.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.342
Saturday, when all my brothers
are playing football...

32:25.510 --> 32:27.978
...I’m putting on a magic show...

32:28.446 --> 32:30.505
...for some rich kid’s birthday party.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.673
Let’s see you do something magic.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.581
Say, aren’t you too young to drive?

32:36.754 --> 32:38.619
Well, my neighbor’s
supposed to take it.

32:38.790 --> 32:42.157
My father’s really counting on it
being at the station when he gets in.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.227
You think you could take it?
I can pay you.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.125
Say, you know you got
a chipped tooth?

32:49.100 --> 32:52.536
- How come I never see you in school?
- I don’t go to school.

32:52.704 --> 32:57.573
- You sick or something?
- No, school is stultifying.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.369
You say this was your father’s car?

32:59.811 --> 33:02.837
No, no. What I said was that
my father needs it at the station.

33:03.514 --> 33:06.278
- It’s hers.
- Whose?

33:06.451 --> 33:08.442
Old lady Hallet's.

33:08.619 --> 33:12.453
It’s a beauty.
Only 34,000 miles on it.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.215
I ought to know.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.519
My father has a service station.
He works on it.

33:16.694 --> 33:19.254
- She’s lending it to us.
- No way.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.226
She’s letting my father.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.697
She won’t even let
her own creep son drive it.

33:24.869 --> 33:28.600
- Here’s $5.
- I’m already late for my magic show.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.574
You gonna come back afterwards?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.609
Please?

33:38.316 --> 33:41.615
- Look, I need your help.
- Maybe after the magic show.

33:41.786 --> 33:43.549
You promise?

33:59.103 --> 34:01.697
Ma, the new trick with the hand puppet
went over really big.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.137
I’m still here at the birthday party.

34:05.209 --> 34:08.371
No, Ma, they asked me, really.
They asked me to stay for dinner too.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.810
Just hamburgers and Cokes.

34:11.248 --> 34:14.150
Come on, tell Tom he can take her
to the movie for a change.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.342
It’s his turn anyway.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.920
Look, I’ll talk to you later, okay?
Good...

34:20.992 --> 34:24.120
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye-bye.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.621
You don’t have any
brothers or sisters, do you?

34:27.799 --> 34:29.027
No.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.929
That’s something
I can’t even imagine.

34:31.101 --> 34:34.538
- Hey, light the candles, huh?
- Yeah, sure.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.009
- Hey, that’s a pretty dress.
- Thanks.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.610
My father and I bought it
in Morocco.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.576
Hey, they smoke a lot of hash there.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.978
They do a lot of things there.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.752
Did you ever smoke hash?

34:51.355 --> 34:53.322
Hundreds of times.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.290
- Yeah? No kidding?
- Yeah.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.655
You’re a regular hippie, huh?

34:58.362 --> 35:00.227
No, not really.

35:02.066 --> 35:05.866
Go ahead, sit down.
Want some wine?

35:06.037 --> 35:08.562
- Do you?
- No, I hate it.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.172
Me too.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.156
You’re a pretty good cook.

35:31.429 --> 35:34.796
- Is that so surprising?
- I only meant for being 13 and all.

35:35.032 --> 35:39.298
How old do you have to be before
people start treating you like a person?

35:40.338 --> 35:41.396
- Hey, Mario.
- Yeah?

35:41.572 --> 35:43.563
Thanks about the car and stuff.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.974
You know, you may be smart,
but you’re stupid.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.479
I mean, if you wanted to get her car
away from the front of the house...

35:51.649 --> 35:54.447
...why go to all the hassle
of taking it down to the station?

35:55.353 --> 35:57.253
You see, the trick in magic...

35:57.421 --> 36:00.390
...is to do the one thing
so simple and so obvious...

36:00.558 --> 36:02.822
...that no one ever thinks of it.

36:04.562 --> 36:08.328
You see? What’s simpler than putting
the car back where it came from?

36:08.499 --> 36:11.366
Did anyone see you
take her car back to her office?

36:11.536 --> 36:13.265
Jesus, you think I wanna get busted...

36:13.437 --> 36:16.873
...for ripping off old lady Hallet’s
most prized possession?

36:18.209 --> 36:21.474
You know, you don’t even trust me
enough to tell me why I did it.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.481
You did it to help me.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.474
Did you lock her car doors?

36:30.321 --> 36:32.516
You should’ve put them
through her office mailbox.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.749
No, I shouldn’t. Let me tell you.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.326
I’m sitting there in her Bentley
in the dark, right...

36:37.495 --> 36:40.589
...in front of her goddamn office,
trying not to let anybody see me...

36:40.765 --> 36:42.062
...and ask me what I’m doing.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.757
I gotta be careful, right?

36:43.935 --> 36:47.496
Now, I may not know why Mrs. Hallet
didn’t drive her own car back...

36:47.672 --> 36:49.640
...but one thing I do know:

36:49.807 --> 36:51.707
Why would Mrs. Hallet
put her own keys...

36:51.876 --> 36:54.242
...through her own goddamn
office mailbox?

36:54.412 --> 36:58.746
She wouldn’t. She’d keep her keys.
They’d be wherever she is.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.144
I feel like some wine.

37:02.587 --> 37:06.455
Hey, now, this is pretty fancy.
Doesn’t even unscrew.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.559
It’s got a cork and everything.
Now, this is class.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.787
You still didn’t tell me why. How come
she didn’t drive her car back?

37:12.964 --> 37:15.797
- So, what do you care?
- I risked my goddamn ass for you.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.991
You didn’t have to.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.636
Look, you better tell me
what the hell is going on...

37:19.804 --> 37:22.967
...because if I'd left that car
down at the station like you told me...

37:23.140 --> 37:25.404
...everybody in the village
would’ve recognized it.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.813
You don’t trust anybody, do you?

37:30.982 --> 37:34.145
- You want another lamb chop?
- Shouldn’t we save it for your father?

37:34.318 --> 37:36.183
He’s staying overnight in New York.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.655
Hey, you never said that.

37:38.823 --> 37:42.384
- Have you ever stayed alone before?
- Sure, hundreds of times.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.289
Like all those times
you smoked hash?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.999
- Aren’t you scared?
- Of what?

37:49.166 --> 37:50.861
- Of being alone.
- No.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.162
You know, last week on TV
I saw this old woman...

37:53.337 --> 37:56.101
...who was strangled
with a body stocking.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.264
I mean, it can happen.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.137
You know you got an outside light?

38:07.918 --> 38:10.978
- Leave it on all the time, okay?
- Thanks.

38:11.155 --> 38:13.749
You know, with me,
you got an indoor light.

38:14.592 --> 38:15.820
Hey, that’s neat.

38:15.993 --> 38:19.326
Well, Mr. Show Biz, that’s me.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.524
You need more of an audience.

38:24.001 --> 38:25.866
I’d like you to meet Gordon.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.436
Gordon.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.632
Isn’t he cute?

38:32.810 --> 38:35.040
- Hey, hi, Gordon.
- Get away.

38:35.212 --> 38:36.907
You don’t even trust me
with your rat.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.742
- It’s a hamster.
- It looks like a rat.

38:38.916 --> 38:41.248
- You look like a rat.
- No.

38:41.619 --> 38:42.916
- Come here.
- You got any pets?

38:43.087 --> 38:45.920
No, just my parents,
which I water and feed regularly.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.421
How nice.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.786
I think we gotta get Gordon
back to the cage.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.985
L"II make a deal with you.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.723
You tell me about the car,
I’ll tell you why I’m crippled.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.230
No.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.890
It was polio shots.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.969
See, I have so many
brothers and sisters...

39:00.137 --> 39:03.664
...that my mother forgot
who did and who didn’t.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.368
Okay, now I wanna know
about the car. All of it.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.775
We have some peach ice cream.
Would you like some?

39:09.947 --> 39:11.380
No.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.441
- The car.
- Her car?

39:14.618 --> 39:17.018
Did you leave any fingerprints?

39:18.823 --> 39:22.054
Presto! No fingerprints.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.225
You’re so magic,
let’s see you do a trick.

39:24.395 --> 39:26.556
- Okay. Hold on to my cane.
- I want a trick!

39:26.731 --> 39:28.221
- Hold on to my cane.
- All right.

39:28.399 --> 39:32.597
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now
make an automobile disappear.

39:32.770 --> 39:36.365
- You already did that.
- Well, then, behold, I shall disappear.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.373
Now, go hide your eyes
in the corner and don’t peek.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.239
Okay, you ready? Now, don’t peek.
Don’t peek, Gordon.

39:42.413 --> 39:48.374
Here we go. One, two, three.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.547
Ready or not, here I come.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.255
Mario?

39:59.130 --> 40:00.791
Hey, Mario?

40:14.779 --> 40:16.770
Mario?

40:21.952 --> 40:23.544
Give me that!

40:24.188 --> 40:26.019
Well, Mary-fucking-Poppins.

40:26.190 --> 40:29.159
- Give me that!
- Come and get it.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.090
Give it!

40:32.263 --> 40:34.094
Mario.

40:35.466 --> 40:37.627
Mario, I mean it. Now, stop.

40:37.802 --> 40:39.463
Mario.

40:47.511 --> 40:48.978
Listen.

40:49.580 --> 40:52.413
Somebody’s out there. Okay.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.487
Hey, it’s a police car.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.292
Hey, don’t worry. It’s my uncle Ron.

41:08.933 --> 41:11.595
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.566
Would you like a glass of wine?

41:13.737 --> 41:15.728
Yeah, it’s okay. You’re off duty.

41:15.906 --> 41:17.271
Hey, so, what’s happening, unc?

41:17.441 --> 41:19.272
I mean, where’s your
Playmate of the Week?

41:19.443 --> 41:20.933
She’s waiting outside in the car.

41:21.111 --> 41:23.705
You know, he likes the ones
who look like they were...

41:23.881 --> 41:26.577
...blown up with a bicycle pump,
you know?

41:26.750 --> 41:30.242
What, are you gonna bust us
for drinking here? I won’t have it.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.881
You’re just lucky
I don’t smell any grass.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.490
You got any? L"II buy it cheap.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.523
No respect. No respect for the law.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.889
Respect? You want respect?

41:39.063 --> 41:42.157
He wants respect, and he’s using
his police car to get all his action.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.301
Just the two of you, huh?

41:44.468 --> 41:46.698
My father’s sleeping.

41:46.871 --> 41:49.999
- You met her father?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.539
He had dinner with you, huh?

41:51.709 --> 41:54.439
Hey, how many plates you see here?
I count two. One...

41:54.612 --> 41:56.603
Yeah, okay, okay, wise guy.
All right.

41:56.780 --> 41:59.544
He was tired,
so he went upstairs to bed.

41:59.717 --> 42:04.711
Candlelight, wine and a fireplace.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.182
It’s really very romantic.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.957
Frank Hallet called in twice.

42:12.129 --> 42:15.462
- He said his mother’s missing.
- She’s probably out house-pimping.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.430
Mario don’t like the Hallets.

42:17.601 --> 42:20.161
Me? I don’t think you like them
too much either.

42:20.337 --> 42:22.202
I remember he tried
to get Hallet busted...

42:22.373 --> 42:24.534
...for dragging some little girl
into the bushes.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.868
He couldn’t do it, though.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.238
All Hallet’s mother did
was marry the creep off...

42:28.412 --> 42:30.676
...to some waitress with two kids.
- That’s enough.

42:30.848 --> 42:33.715
- To prove he was normal.
- Don’t be such a smart-ass.

42:33.884 --> 42:37.285
Anyway, her car’s in front
of the office, but no sign of her.

42:37.454 --> 42:39.445
And Hallet said he was
coming over here...

42:39.623 --> 42:42.786
...to pick up some jelly glasses
or something like that.

42:42.960 --> 42:48.728
Yeah, well, you see,
they’re still here waiting for her.

42:49.199 --> 42:52.134
- No one’s touched them.
- So she never came by, huh?

42:52.303 --> 42:55.932
- No.
- So you came looking for her here?

42:56.106 --> 42:58.734
I came here because I thought
that Rynn might be alone.

42:58.909 --> 43:01.901
Did you think that fink would be
waiting here for you to catch him?

43:02.079 --> 43:05.014
Look, if you don’t want your mom
and dad to know you were here...

43:05.182 --> 43:07.810
...don’t be such a smart-ass.
- Who’s a smart-ass?

43:07.985 --> 43:10.419
Why don’t you teach him
some manners.

43:11.021 --> 43:14.479
Oh, if Mrs. Hallet comes by, could
you have her call the police station?

43:14.658 --> 43:16.353
- Okay?
- Fine.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.694
- Thanks for the wine.
- Good night.

43:20.197 --> 43:22.791
And don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.

43:30.074 --> 43:32.201
- I mean, that was scary, wasn’t it?
- Yeah.

43:32.376 --> 43:35.174
Wasn’t it? How’d you like the way
I made your father disappear?

43:35.346 --> 43:38.144
- You lied.
- You bet your ass.

43:38.315 --> 43:40.681
What did you want me
to do anyway?

43:42.252 --> 43:44.482
Well, where do you think
you’re going?

43:44.655 --> 43:45.815
Just testing.

43:45.990 --> 43:49.289
Like, you don’t really want me to go
or anything, do you? Do you, huh?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.018
- No.
- Oh, you got feelings, huh?

43:51.195 --> 43:53.425
I thought you were
a piece of cardboard. Come.

43:53.597 --> 43:55.292
Come on.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.560
Are you crazy?

44:03.340 --> 44:06.776
He’s back. Come on.
Go ahead, answer the door.

44:09.413 --> 44:11.176
- You ready?
- Yeah, go ahead.

44:12.216 --> 44:13.706
Hello.

44:15.352 --> 44:17.343
May I come in?

44:19.523 --> 44:22.856
I think it’s time you and I
had a little talk, don’t you agree?

44:25.696 --> 44:29.996
Are these the famous jelly jars?

44:32.169 --> 44:33.659
Hello.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.531
Only two for dinner?

44:40.544 --> 44:43.308
Did your father quit smoking, Rynn?

44:43.480 --> 44:45.243
Give us a light, son.

45:04.668 --> 45:07.569
It’s cold in here. Let’s put
some more wood on the fire.

45:07.805 --> 45:09.397
L"II get it.

45:17.114 --> 45:18.411
Hello, Gordon.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.695
Where’s your father, Rynn?

45:39.069 --> 45:40.969
Do you love Gordon?

45:41.939 --> 45:43.167
Yes.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.508
Yes, what?

45:47.344 --> 45:49.244
Yes, I love Gordon.

45:51.315 --> 45:53.613
And I think Gordon loves you too.

46:03.961 --> 46:05.690
No!

46:05.863 --> 46:07.922
Hey, what are you? A maniac?

46:21.912 --> 46:23.812
The son of a bitch bit me.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.816
Give me some disinfectant.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.717
It’s upstairs in the medicine cabinet.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.786
Now, listen to me, young lady.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.985
I know you’re up to something.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.894
And I wanna know
where your father is.

46:42.533 --> 46:47.470
What'll you tell me this time?
He’s working? Or sleeping?

46:47.638 --> 46:49.697
Did he have dinner here?

46:49.873 --> 46:53.036
- Did you have dinner here, son?
- Yep.

46:53.510 --> 46:55.501
Just you and pretty Rynn?

46:56.046 --> 46:57.570
Yep.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.574
- And where’s he?
- Who?

47:00.751 --> 47:03.845
- Who are we talking about?
- Oh, her father’s sleeping.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.216
- Upstairs?
- Upstairs.

47:06.390 --> 47:08.051
- You were gonna say in the study.
- No.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.955
- Don’t lie to me, damn it. You were.
- No, I wasn’t.

47:12.729 --> 47:14.219
- Who is he?
- I’m Mario Podesta.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.390
- I asked you. Who is he?
- He’s Mario Podesta.

47:17.734 --> 47:21.067
Oh, yes. I think I’ve seen you hobbling
around the village, haven’t I?

47:21.238 --> 47:22.569
- My uncle’s a cop.
- Really?

47:22.739 --> 47:24.536
He was just here.

47:24.975 --> 47:27.170
- Why was he here?
- And he’s coming back.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.778
- That’s not what I asked you.
- Tell him.

47:29.947 --> 47:31.847
Yes, tell me.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.507
He said you called about your mother.
Said you might come looking for her.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.153
Why would my dear mother be here?

47:37.321 --> 47:39.380
Unless she ran off
with the man of the house...

47:39.556 --> 47:41.080
...which has happened on occasion.

47:41.258 --> 47:43.590
- She’s not here.
- No, it was about the jelly glasses.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.285
The other day you said
you didn’t have any boyfriends.

47:46.463 --> 47:47.452
Yes.

47:47.631 --> 47:49.929
- Are you her boyfriend?
- Yes.

47:51.168 --> 47:53.659
You told me no boyfriends.

47:53.837 --> 47:56.305
She’s very young.
Did she tell you how old she was?

47:56.473 --> 47:59.237
- Thirteen.
- Don’t you know any girls your age?

47:59.409 --> 48:02.242
Or do girls your age like to dance?

48:02.412 --> 48:05.279
- The jelly glasses.
- What about them?

48:05.682 --> 48:08.412
- You can take them now.
- Not now.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.753
Perhaps Mother came by
but you weren’t home.

48:10.921 --> 48:12.718
I was here all the time.

48:12.890 --> 48:15.791
- Didn’t you go to the football game?
- I couldn’t have missed her.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.456
So you say you’ve
been here all along?

48:18.629 --> 48:20.824
- Yeah.
- That’s very strange.

48:20.998 --> 48:22.431
You can take the glasses now.

48:22.599 --> 48:24.260
- L"II put them in your car.
- Will you?

48:24.434 --> 48:26.425
- Yeah, I’ll do it right now.
- No, you can’t.

48:26.603 --> 48:27.968
No car.

48:28.171 --> 48:31.106
See, I walked here tonight,
as my dear wife has the station wagon.

48:31.275 --> 48:34.142
As for the Bentley,
dear Mother has the keys.

48:34.444 --> 48:35.911
What do you want, Mr. Hallet?

48:37.147 --> 48:39.945
- What do you want, son?
- What do you mean?

48:40.117 --> 48:43.018
You want what all boyfriends want.
You don’t like girls?

48:43.186 --> 48:45.086
- Yes, I like girls.
- You don’t want Rynn?

48:47.357 --> 48:49.587
Be a good little magician,
will you, son?

48:49.760 --> 48:52.024
Disappear yourself.
Tell him to get out of here.

48:52.195 --> 48:54.425
- He’s my friend.
- But not your boyfriend.

48:55.132 --> 48:57.965
First, I shall tell you what I want.

48:58.168 --> 49:01.660
I wanna know what’s been
happening here in this house.

49:01.838 --> 49:04.363
I wanna know
what happened here today!

49:06.276 --> 49:07.300
Nothing happened.

49:07.477 --> 49:09.809
All day is a long time
for nothing to happen.

49:09.980 --> 49:11.538
Just now the police were here.

49:11.715 --> 49:14.843
Yes or no? That happened, didn’t it?

49:15.018 --> 49:17.486
The police were here, yes or no?

49:18.121 --> 49:22.251
Officer Miglioriti came to say
you were looking for your mother.

49:22.426 --> 49:23.950
Go on.

49:24.127 --> 49:26.891
- There are the jelly glasses.
- Meaning what?

49:27.064 --> 49:29.999
- Meaning she hasn’t been here.
- That doesn’t prove anything.

49:31.335 --> 49:34.099
- I guess I can’t help you, can I?
- Do you wanna help me?

49:35.472 --> 49:37.838
- Do you wanna help me, son?
- Sure.

49:38.008 --> 49:40.738
Then get your ass
the hell out of here right now.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.572
Hey, Rynn, call the cops.

49:43.513 --> 49:45.310
Be my guest.

49:57.127 --> 50:00.028
What’s the matter, gimp?
Got trouble staying on your feet?

50:07.471 --> 50:09.439
I didn’t think you’d call.

50:09.639 --> 50:11.539
Hit the road, wop.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.640
- We’ll both go.
- No, just you and your goddamn cape.

50:14.811 --> 50:16.642
Get out of here.

50:25.922 --> 50:29.414
I’m a wop.
Wops carry knives, right?

50:30.060 --> 50:33.928
Guinea. Dago. Wop.

50:34.097 --> 50:36.793
Easy, son. Easy.
I take it back. I take it all back.

50:37.134 --> 50:39.898
What do they call guys like you
who hang around little girls?

50:40.470 --> 50:41.698
A pervert?

50:42.039 --> 50:45.270
You know, if I stick this in your guts,
all the cops will do is thank me.

50:46.810 --> 50:49.074
Now, I think you’d better get
the hell out of here.

50:49.246 --> 50:50.941
Get out of here!

50:58.755 --> 51:00.586
- Call the cops.
- No.

51:01.124 --> 51:03.354
Little son of a bitch.

51:03.794 --> 51:07.662
I’m not through with you,
that’s for damn sure.

51:23.313 --> 51:24.871
Is it hers?

51:25.449 --> 51:26.973
Yeah.

51:38.161 --> 51:39.526
Come on.

52:44.427 --> 52:46.292
Oh, boy.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.930
That’s trouble.

52:49.933 --> 52:52.094
I mean, how did...?

52:52.602 --> 52:55.696
Why don’t you take the cookies in
where the tea will be.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.535
Mario?

52:58.708 --> 53:03.008
Rynn, how long has it been
for your mother?

53:05.615 --> 53:08.106
October 17th.

53:09.986 --> 53:13.080
I don’t understand.
I mean, don’t bodies...?

53:13.256 --> 53:15.349
- Decompose?
- Yeah.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.152
Well, you can put stuff on them.

53:17.327 --> 53:20.125
So why don’t you take
the tray in next to the fire, all right?

53:20.297 --> 53:21.787
Yeah.

53:21.965 --> 53:24.126
How do you know
how to do that stuff?

53:24.901 --> 53:27.165
I looked it up in the library.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.074
In London we found out
my father was dying.

53:34.244 --> 53:35.802
My mother had run away
when I was 3.

53:35.979 --> 53:38.971
He didn’t want her to get her
red fingernails into me ever again.

53:39.149 --> 53:40.946
We left England
without a word to anyone.

53:43.086 --> 53:45.213
It was the end of the summer
when I came here...

53:45.388 --> 53:47.481
...and I knew this was the place.

53:47.857 --> 53:49.984
But he said I should think
it over for a week...

53:50.160 --> 53:54.028
...to make sure I wanted to spend
the next three years of my life here.

53:54.197 --> 53:56.995
The rent’s paid up
for the next three years.

53:57.701 --> 54:00.192
So three more years like this?

54:03.640 --> 54:08.839
Almost all September,
he looked fine.

54:10.513 --> 54:13.505
If the pain was terrible,
he never said anything.

54:14.651 --> 54:17.745
Then one Sunday evening...

54:18.588 --> 54:20.818
...we were sitting in this room...

54:21.891 --> 54:25.156
...and he whispered to me
in a very soft voice...

54:26.796 --> 54:29.731
...that I wasn’t like
anybody else in the world...

54:31.101 --> 54:33.331
...that people
wouldn’t understand me.

54:33.503 --> 54:35.869
They’d order me around,
tell me what to do...

54:36.039 --> 54:39.372
...and try to make me into the person
they wanted me to be.

54:40.644 --> 54:44.944
Since I was only a kid,
I couldn’t say anything.

54:46.149 --> 54:48.709
I’d have to stay alone...

54:50.020 --> 54:52.989
...keep out of trouble and make
myself very small in the world.

54:54.624 --> 54:55.886
All alone?

54:57.060 --> 54:59.290
We worked out every detail.

54:59.462 --> 55:01.430
We knew it wouldn’t be easy.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.167
Here’s a letter from my father.

55:09.272 --> 55:11.365
"Don’t give in and play their game.

55:11.641 --> 55:13.905
Fight them any way you have to.

55:14.377 --> 55:15.969
Survive."

55:16.546 --> 55:18.377
That’s what he said.

55:19.816 --> 55:22.011
Then he kissed me...

55:22.185 --> 55:25.177
...and walked off into the trees
and down the lane.

55:25.889 --> 55:28.949
In that room, I found charts
of tide tables and waters...

55:29.125 --> 55:31.491
...in the sound and the ocean.

55:34.431 --> 55:36.524
He'll never be found.

55:38.568 --> 55:40.559
Did you cry a lot?

55:41.705 --> 55:43.969
Depends what you mean by a lot.

55:45.442 --> 55:48.969
No. I guess not very much.

55:50.046 --> 55:51.536
Do you believe in God?

55:51.715 --> 55:54.741
- It’d be nice.
- But you don’t.

55:55.118 --> 55:56.710
I don’t know.

55:57.087 --> 55:59.851
You know, it’s all so goddamn wild.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.081
I mean...

56:02.759 --> 56:04.056
...there’s so many problems.

56:04.227 --> 56:07.287
- How do you pay for stuff?
- Traveler’s checks.

56:07.464 --> 56:09.762
Yeah, kids can have them too.

56:10.100 --> 56:13.934
I keep them in a safe-deposit box
in the bank.

56:14.471 --> 56:16.735
I have to make them last
for three years.

56:18.014 --> 56:21.541
- How’d your mother find you?
- By lying to my father’s publisher.

56:22.018 --> 56:25.454
She walked right in.
Fingernails as red as ever.

56:25.621 --> 56:28.249
My God, the nerve of her.

56:29.125 --> 56:33.084
She sat right over there.
Smoked her gold-tipped cigarettes...

56:33.562 --> 56:36.497
...went on and on about the
pollution in the Mediterranean...

56:36.665 --> 56:39.133
...and how marvelous it would be
to stay here.

56:39.368 --> 56:43.668
I hated myself for doing it,
but I actually acted happy to see her.

56:44.106 --> 56:49.703
She asked me for a drink, but I lied
and told her we didn’t have any.

56:50.646 --> 56:53.342
I gave her some tea
with the same almond biscuits.

56:53.516 --> 56:54.813
They’re very good.

56:55.117 --> 56:59.554
My father had given me a small bottle
containing some white powder.

56:59.955 --> 57:04.324
He said if she should arrive,
I should put it in her tea.

57:04.493 --> 57:06.757
It would calm her,
make her less aggressive.

57:07.129 --> 57:08.790
Well, it sure did.

57:08.964 --> 57:10.659
But you didn’t know
what it was, huh?

57:10.833 --> 57:12.391
No, not until after.

57:12.568 --> 57:14.798
I looked it up
based on its properties.

57:14.970 --> 57:17.530
- Potassium cyanide.
- And that’s what you put in her tea?

57:17.706 --> 57:20.869
Father meant what he said about
doing anything you have to to survive.

57:24.447 --> 57:26.108
How come you’re not
drinking yours?

57:27.783 --> 57:31.549
Mine’s still too hot.
I didn’t put in any cold milk.

57:32.721 --> 57:35.189
I can still see her red nails
holding up that cup.

57:36.092 --> 57:39.027
After a few sips, she said
that the tea tasted of almonds.

57:40.930 --> 57:42.625
"It’s the almond cookies," I told her.

57:43.232 --> 57:46.861
"They come from Fortnum’s."
She loved that.

57:48.370 --> 57:51.066
- How long did it take?
- Quite fast, actually.

57:53.109 --> 57:55.009
You mean, like,
first you can’t breathe?

57:55.344 --> 57:57.835
Yeah. Apparently.

58:00.583 --> 58:03.711
What’s wrong with you?
You okay?

58:09.658 --> 58:11.819
Yeah, now I’m okay.

58:14.196 --> 58:15.720
I’m all right.

58:20.936 --> 58:22.665
Listen.

58:25.007 --> 58:29.603
It’s just the wind.
Sounds like it’s alive.

58:30.546 --> 58:32.377
Look, about the telephone.

58:32.548 --> 58:34.516
We better not call each other
from now on...

58:34.683 --> 58:36.810
...because somebody
might be listening, okay?

58:36.986 --> 58:38.453
Okay.

01:00:41.844 --> 01:00:43.505
Let’s go.

01:00:45.047 --> 01:00:47.311
I’m not gonna play their game.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.915
Would that be so awful?

01:00:50.119 --> 01:00:51.586
The game is pretending, you know?

01:00:51.754 --> 01:00:55.121
It’s like going through the motions
of living without really living.

01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:56.781
But what about school?

01:00:56.959 --> 01:00:59.086
School is having people
tell you what life is...

01:00:59.261 --> 01:01:00.922
...and never finding out by yourself.

01:01:01.096 --> 01:01:03.155
Yeah, but kids have to go to school.

01:01:03.332 --> 01:01:04.629
Why?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.427
Okay, so your father taught you.

01:01:06.602 --> 01:01:08.536
Everybody doesn’t have
a father like yours.

01:01:08.704 --> 01:01:11.002
Everybody can’t be like you.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.706
If I’d listened to them,
I’d be like them.

01:01:13.876 --> 01:01:17.573
Damn. You keep saying "them"
like everyone’s out to get you.

01:01:18.147 --> 01:01:19.512
Maybe they are.

01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:21.377
Well, you gotta trust somebody.

01:03:39.021 --> 01:03:40.318
Mario!

01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:43.722
Come on.

01:03:45.727 --> 01:03:47.558
Mario.

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:52.193
Come on, Mario. Mario!

01:03:57.005 --> 01:03:58.939
You all right?

01:03:59.975 --> 01:04:02.944
I’ve got a tub waiting
for you upstairs.

01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:28.269
Hello?

01:04:30.205 --> 01:04:31.900
Mr. Hallet?

01:04:32.307 --> 01:04:33.797
Mr. Hallet, I know this is you...

01:04:33.976 --> 01:04:37.377
...because everybody else is at
the football game this afternoon.

01:04:38.213 --> 01:04:40.807
I should warn you that the police
are watching our house...

01:04:40.983 --> 01:04:43.349
...right this very minute, Mr. Hallet.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.320
I found a pair of
your father’s pajamas.

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.495
It’s a pretty good fit.

01:04:56.665 --> 01:04:59.498
Come on, you’re shivering.
Sit down.

01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:03.660
- Who called?
- No one.

01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.739
Rynn, who called?

01:05:05.908 --> 01:05:08.376
Well, whoever called
didn’t leave their name.

01:05:08.544 --> 01:05:10.307
Was it Hallet?

01:05:11.113 --> 01:05:13.911
- Yeah.
- That creep.

01:05:14.783 --> 01:05:16.910
You’re like ice.

01:05:17.252 --> 01:05:18.879
Come on.

01:05:33.502 --> 01:05:35.766
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:42.267
It’s dark already.

01:05:47.182 --> 01:05:48.843
Mario...

01:05:51.019 --> 01:05:53.817
...if you want,
I can get into bed with you.

01:06:09.838 --> 01:06:12.705
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

01:06:16.345 --> 01:06:18.074
Mario?

01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:22.079
I know what you’re gonna ask.

01:06:23.251 --> 01:06:25.116
Have you ever?

01:06:26.121 --> 01:06:28.180
Hundreds of times.

01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:35.329
Do they expect you
home for dinner?

01:06:36.098 --> 01:06:37.895
Would it be so terrible
if you didn’t go?

01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:41.263
I mean, if your parents did
find out about us?

01:06:42.137 --> 01:06:44.230
Your uncle Ron knows.

01:06:44.806 --> 01:06:48.765
Look, Rynn, they’d wanna
know all about you.

01:06:48.944 --> 01:06:51.276
Every goddamn thing.

01:06:53.248 --> 01:06:56.308
And I’m not as good
at lying as you are.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.621
Here, take this. It’s my father’s.

01:07:07.062 --> 01:07:09.826
Like your father said in that letter:

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.626
Since when do they let kids
do what they want?

01:07:28.884 --> 01:07:32.684
- Come back after dinner?
- L"II try.

01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:42.089
- Who is it?
- Ron Miglioriti.

01:08:46.228 --> 01:08:49.287
Hi. I’m just making
my Saturday-night call.

01:08:49.464 --> 01:08:51.022
Yeah, come on in.

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:53.359
- You all right?
- Fine.

01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:56.732
- How are you?
- Fine, fine, thanks.

01:08:56.904 --> 01:08:59.567
- Can I get you anything...?
- No, no. I can’t stay, really.

01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:02.437
Your pumped-up lady
waiting for you?

01:09:02.911 --> 01:09:06.038
Sorry. Does make me sound
like a smart-ass, doesn’t it?

01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:11.385
- You’re all alone, huh?
- My father’s here.

01:09:11.553 --> 01:09:15.580
Rynn, I don’t believe what you’ve been
telling me about your father.

01:09:15.756 --> 01:09:17.156
No?

01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:20.350
No, no, you’re gonna tell me
that he’s in there working, right?

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:22.827
He was this afternoon. Translating.

01:09:22.997 --> 01:09:25.261
Then he was, and now he isn’t?
That’s it, huh?

01:09:25.433 --> 01:09:26.923
No, he’s resting upstairs.

01:09:27.102 --> 01:09:29.366
I’ve been here three times.

01:09:29.537 --> 01:09:32.803
And each time I notice
how good you are with words.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:36.207
The way you speak,
you’re very careful.

01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:37.868
You’re too goddamn careful.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:41.314
- You don’t believe he’s upstairs, then?
- No.

01:09:41.683 --> 01:09:43.377
All right.

01:09:44.486 --> 01:09:46.113
Father!

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.385
Father?

01:09:52.394 --> 01:09:54.988
- He should be down in a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

01:09:55.564 --> 01:09:59.796
Look, I understand, because I haven’t
been telling you the truth all the time.

01:10:00.468 --> 01:10:03.437
Because my father isn’t a well man.

01:10:04.105 --> 01:10:05.800
Maybe you don’t understand
about poets.

01:10:05.974 --> 01:10:10.240
Edgar Allen Poe was a drug addict.
Dylan Thomas drank himself to death.

01:10:10.412 --> 01:10:11.777
Sylvia Plath took her own life.

01:10:11.947 --> 01:10:14.142
Rynn, we’re talking about your father.

01:10:14.783 --> 01:10:16.614
Yeah, well...

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.123
Sometimes my father goes
into his room and locks the door.

01:10:23.325 --> 01:10:25.088
He keeps something
in a desk drawer.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.228
I don’t know what it is.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.259
But I know...

01:10:30.866 --> 01:10:33.164
...when he locks that door...

01:10:34.169 --> 01:10:37.627
...he doesn’t want me to see
the way he becomes, you know?

01:10:37.839 --> 01:10:39.830
That may sound stupid,
but you don’t know my...

01:10:40.008 --> 01:10:41.134
Yes, Rynn, what is it?

01:10:44.679 --> 01:10:46.977
Father, I’d like you to meet
Officer Miglioriti.

01:10:47.148 --> 01:10:50.117
- You know, the one I told you about.
- Good evening, sir.

01:10:50.285 --> 01:10:52.981
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yes, quite all right. Quite all right.

01:10:53.154 --> 01:10:54.815
I’m the one to apologize.

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:56.480
I confess to being a bit tired.

01:10:56.658 --> 01:10:58.649
So how can my daughter
and I help you?

01:10:58.827 --> 01:11:00.818
No, no problem, no problem.

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:03.897
Rynn, nip into my study,
get one of my books, will you?

01:11:04.065 --> 01:11:05.896
And a pen, please.

01:11:06.401 --> 01:11:09.336
Rynn tells me we’ve promised you
an autographed copy.

01:11:11.172 --> 01:11:14.039
If you’d be good enough
to spell Miglioriti.

01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:15.642
"Ron" will be okay.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.710
Yes, Ron, okay. Here.

01:11:18.079 --> 01:11:21.515
Ron, from Lester.

01:11:24.519 --> 01:11:26.953
Well, it’s really been nice
to meet you, sir.

01:11:27.122 --> 01:11:30.023
Yes, it’s a pleasure. Good night.

01:11:30.558 --> 01:11:31.923
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:11:32.093 --> 01:11:34.561
- See you later, Rynn.
- Good night.

01:11:39.634 --> 01:11:41.158
Guess I owe you an apology, huh?

01:11:41.336 --> 01:11:43.395
That’s all right. Don’t worry about it.

01:11:45.473 --> 01:11:48.840
- Good night.
- I hope you enjoy the book.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.637
Thanks.

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:14.966
You were great.
Your voice was so deep.

01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:17.366
Yeah.

01:12:21.276 --> 01:12:24.268
Yeah, it’s this damn cold.

01:12:27.415 --> 01:12:30.680
How do you spell Miglioriti?

01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:34.980
How would I have known
if you hadn’t come back?

01:12:35.156 --> 01:12:38.216
- I would have come back anyway.
- I hoped you would.

01:12:38.693 --> 01:12:42.094
Remember? You said
I don’t trust anybody.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.426
You know, we should have told
Uncle Ron what he was interrupting.

01:12:48.603 --> 01:12:51.037
A gentleman never tells.

01:12:51.206 --> 01:12:53.606
Well, maybe in England they don’t...

01:12:53.775 --> 01:12:56.335
...but here they never
shut up about it.

01:12:56.745 --> 01:12:59.942
L"II bet half... Well, hell,
most of the football team...

01:13:00.115 --> 01:13:02.549
...that’s all they ever do,
is talk about it.

01:13:04.452 --> 01:13:07.080
You know, I won’t tell anybody.

01:13:08.056 --> 01:13:09.819
You know, we have
to trust each other...

01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:12.687
...because most people don’t
go through as much as we have.

01:13:12.861 --> 01:13:15.694
Not even in a whole entire lifetime.

01:13:17.465 --> 01:13:19.524
No one will know about us.

01:13:19.701 --> 01:13:22.363
I never knew how much
I needed you.

01:13:22.871 --> 01:13:24.566
Ever think maybe
I’m playing your game?

01:13:24.739 --> 01:13:26.229
Because you want to?

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:28.933
No. Because I love you.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.050
Thank you.

01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:42.689
- You’re gonna catch my cold.
- I don’t care.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.526
You know, when I told you
I didn’t mind being alone, I lied.

01:13:50.065 --> 01:13:52.329
Don’t ever leave, okay?

01:14:17.892 --> 01:14:20.053
With all this snow,
it’s a good time to see...

01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:22.355
...if you and your father
have had any visitors.

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:26.466
I love detective stories.
Do you read Agatha Christie?

01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:28.329
All her murder mysteries
take place...

01:14:28.503 --> 01:14:30.801
...in the most beautiful
old English country houses.

01:14:30.972 --> 01:14:32.496
See these?

01:14:32.874 --> 01:14:35.138
Footprints. They’re mine
and my father’s, I expect.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.278
They’re not very clear.

01:14:37.445 --> 01:14:39.675
As long as you’re here,
you wanna give me a hand?

01:14:39.848 --> 01:14:42.646
You know, I can’t
figure you out at all.

01:14:42.817 --> 01:14:45.615
You haven’t even asked me
about Mario.

01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:50.654
- What about him?
- He’s in the hospital.

01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:52.482
Pneumonia.

01:14:54.362 --> 01:14:55.522
How bad?

01:14:55.697 --> 01:14:58.063
Well, without the antibiotics,
he would’ve died.

01:15:00.935 --> 01:15:02.835
I’ve gotta see him.
I’ve gotta see him.

01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:04.869
Can you go now?

01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:14.307
- You’ve seen him?
- Yeah.

01:15:14.482 --> 01:15:17.110
He was delirious
and talking out loud.

01:15:17.285 --> 01:15:18.843
About the two of you.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.248
Yes?

01:15:20.655 --> 01:15:21.952
Saying how much he loves you.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.092
Mario.

01:16:09.103 --> 01:16:10.661
Mario?

01:16:16.344 --> 01:16:18.244
Mario, I love you.

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:24.416
My father worked it all out.

01:16:27.589 --> 01:16:29.352
How I’d live.

01:16:31.192 --> 01:16:32.955
What I’d do.

01:16:36.331 --> 01:16:38.799
But it can’t work.

01:16:41.903 --> 01:16:44.064
It can’t work without you.

01:16:47.842 --> 01:16:49.639
He was wrong.

01:20:46.747 --> 01:20:47.941
No...

01:20:54.555 --> 01:20:56.284
Oh, Mario.

01:20:56.524 --> 01:21:00.324
Anything for a trick.
You weren’t sick at all.

01:21:02.196 --> 01:21:04.926
- Get out of here!
- Trick or treat.

01:21:05.099 --> 01:21:07.863
Mr. Hallet, if you leave right now,
I won’t say a word, okay?

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:12.768
Call the police? No?
Why don’t you call your father.

01:21:14.609 --> 01:21:18.670
The least you could do is offer me
a cup of tea after I got all dressed up.

01:21:21.816 --> 01:21:22.805
If anybody came by...

01:21:22.984 --> 01:21:26.283
...naturally they’d assume I was
your little friend, don’t you think?

01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:28.411
I even limped.

01:21:28.589 --> 01:21:30.386
Officer Miglioriti's
gonna be coming by.

01:21:30.558 --> 01:21:34.460
Officer Miglioriti is at his stupid raffle.

01:21:35.196 --> 01:21:37.494
It’s awful dirty down there
in the cellar.

01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:39.997
I had no idea what I’d find.

01:21:40.167 --> 01:21:43.227
Certainly not those damn jelly jars.

01:21:44.972 --> 01:21:47.702
L"II show you what I did find,
if you’re interested.

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:50.970
A hairpin.

01:21:51.145 --> 01:21:53.739
Not yours, though. No.

01:21:53.915 --> 01:21:57.316
You wouldn’t wear pins
in that pretty hair.

01:21:57.785 --> 01:22:00.618
- Could’ve been down there for years.
- No, it would’ve rusted.

01:22:00.788 --> 01:22:03.484
Besides, it still smells
of the perfume...

01:22:03.658 --> 01:22:06.320
...I gave my mother
for Christmas last year.

01:22:06.494 --> 01:22:08.291
One more thing.

01:22:09.196 --> 01:22:12.927
A bright-red broken fingernail,
wouldn’t you say?

01:22:13.601 --> 01:22:15.796
I wonder who that belongs to.

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:18.564
Not my mother’s color at all.

01:22:19.774 --> 01:22:23.801
No telling what the police
could come up with down there.

01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:26.070
Or out in the garden.

01:22:28.182 --> 01:22:29.672
At least I should thank you...

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:33.479
...for bringing the Bentley
back to the office, though.

01:22:34.655 --> 01:22:37.522
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

01:22:38.659 --> 01:22:40.718
Had to call a locksmith.

01:22:42.363 --> 01:22:44.923
Any idea where the keys might be?

01:22:46.233 --> 01:22:49.225
Perhaps on that chain
around your pretty neck.

01:22:52.673 --> 01:22:56.268
- Where are you going?
- You said you wanted some tea.

01:22:58.846 --> 01:23:02.213
There are some details
still to be worked out, of course.

01:23:02.383 --> 01:23:03.748
Not to worry.

01:23:04.652 --> 01:23:08.816
L"II enjoy figuring them out
on our long winter nights together.

01:23:21.969 --> 01:23:23.436
Hello?

01:23:23.871 --> 01:23:28.672
Officer Miglioriti.
What? Oh, really?

01:23:28.843 --> 01:23:30.435
That’s great.

01:23:33.047 --> 01:23:34.912
No, no, not now.

01:23:35.683 --> 01:23:37.173
L"II manage.

01:23:37.818 --> 01:23:40.810
Okay, thanks. Bye.

01:23:42.089 --> 01:23:45.547
Rule number one: No secrets.

01:23:45.726 --> 01:23:48.524
I won the stupid
Thanksgiving turkey.

01:23:48.696 --> 01:23:49.856
Congratulations.

01:23:50.031 --> 01:23:53.091
And you told him not to bring it by.
Very wise.

01:24:03.477 --> 01:24:05.308
You know...

01:24:05.479 --> 01:24:09.506
...there’s no reason you shouldn’t go
right on living the way you have been.

01:24:10.518 --> 01:24:14.818
Only now, of course,
we’ll be friends, you and I.

01:24:18.159 --> 01:24:20.252
Just us two, huh?

01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:36.633
We could become
very good friends.

01:24:41.716 --> 01:24:44.685
I like the way you handled yourself
on the phone.

01:24:45.219 --> 01:24:47.084
You are brilliant.

01:24:47.588 --> 01:24:49.852
You’re inventive and resourceful...

01:24:50.024 --> 01:24:51.958
...very cool under fire.

01:24:52.126 --> 01:24:53.718
You know how to survive, don’t you?

01:24:53.894 --> 01:24:55.919
I thought I did.

01:25:18.085 --> 01:25:19.882
What about Mario?

01:25:20.054 --> 01:25:23.490
- He’s in the hospital.
- He knows. Everything.

01:25:23.657 --> 01:25:25.557
- Maybe he'll die.
- The doctor says no.

01:25:25.726 --> 01:25:29.560
It really doesn’t matter, you know.
He’s an accomplice.

01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:32.722
- Mr. Hallet?
- Yes, my dear?

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.061
Will you tell your wife?

01:25:35.236 --> 01:25:36.601
What?

01:25:36.771 --> 01:25:38.830
Will you tell your wife?

01:25:41.008 --> 01:25:44.569
Well, suppose you let me
take care of that, okay?

01:25:45.946 --> 01:25:47.675
The fire’s catching.

01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:50.043
It’s nice and cozy now, huh?

01:25:50.217 --> 01:25:53.914
- What are we listening to?
- Chopin. Piano Concerto No. 1.

01:25:54.088 --> 01:25:55.749
Yes.

01:25:56.223 --> 01:25:57.656
It’s lovely.

01:25:58.759 --> 01:26:01.819
- You want milk?
- Yes, please.

01:26:04.131 --> 01:26:05.496
Thank you.

01:26:07.835 --> 01:26:10.929
- Would you like some sugar?
- Just one, please.

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:14.265
L"II expect you to remember that.

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:17.433
That’s easy. It’s the same as I take.

01:26:21.282 --> 01:26:23.750
Nothing like a nice
hot cup of tea, is there?

01:26:23.918 --> 01:26:25.351
No.

01:26:36.864 --> 01:26:40.163
- Something wrong, my dear?
- No.

01:26:40.835 --> 01:26:43.167
Why aren’t you drinking your tea?

01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:45.804
I’m waiting for you. You’re the guest.

01:26:47.942 --> 01:26:50.240
You put more milk in yours.

01:26:50.411 --> 01:26:51.844
Did I?

01:26:52.413 --> 01:26:55.007
Actually, that’s the way
I prefer mine.

01:26:59.553 --> 01:27:01.817
I’d prefer yours.

01:27:03.424 --> 01:27:05.824
Look at me when I talk to you.

01:27:06.227 --> 01:27:08.218
I want yours.

01:27:16.503 --> 01:27:19.802
Gives us more a feeling of sharing,
don’t you agree?

01:27:25.279 --> 01:27:27.144
Ladies first.

01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:30.950
No, wait.

01:27:37.558 --> 01:27:39.025
Is it good?

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:51.801
Just right.

01:27:53.574 --> 01:27:55.371
You know why I switched cups,
don’t you?

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:58.670
- No.
- Oh, now, think.

01:28:01.448 --> 01:28:03.575
Some sort of test?

01:28:04.151 --> 01:28:06.984
Just so you remember,
none of your little tricks.

01:28:20.234 --> 01:28:21.565
Tea tastes like almonds.

01:28:22.036 --> 01:28:24.470
Must be the almond cookies.

01:28:24.805 --> 01:28:26.534
Oh, yes.

01:28:30.778 --> 01:28:32.268
Excuse me.

01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:04.109
You should see the way the fire...

01:29:04.845 --> 01:29:07.006
...lights up your hair.

01:29:09.984 --> 01:29:13.112
All yellow and gold.

01:29:15.656 --> 01:29:17.647
Such lovely hair.
