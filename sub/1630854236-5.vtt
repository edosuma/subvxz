00:19.517 --> 00:21.862

00:21.965 --> 00:23.482
You know, guys...

00:23.586 --> 00:25.655
the homecoming sandwich station

00:25.758 --> 00:27.482
did not used to feel
so involved.

00:27.586 --> 00:29.000
It's probably because
you're just used to

00:29.103 --> 00:30.275
doing the eating part.

00:30.379 --> 00:32.689
The prep takes
a little longer.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.724
Well, in her defense, the eating
part <i>is</i> the best part.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.172
- Mm.
- Okay, so while we're
on topic of HC...

00:39.551 --> 00:40.689
after two years,
it's kinda tiring feeling like

00:40.793 --> 00:42.931
you're living
in your sister's shadow.

00:43.034 --> 00:44.724
They're big shoes to fill,
I know.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.310
Okay, yeah, point is, it's my
junior year, and I feel like

00:48.413 --> 00:52.068
I'm ready to show everybody
who August Walker really is.

00:52.172 --> 00:54.586
Show everyone
or show those boneheads

00:54.689 --> 00:57.448
who are always unironically
going live on Insta.

00:57.551 --> 00:59.275
Brick and Scout?

00:59.379 --> 01:00.655
Brody and Scooter. Yeah.

01:00.758 --> 01:02.655
And it's not
just about them, Stella.

01:02.758 --> 01:07.275
It's about me, which is
why I need your help, Dad.

01:07.379 --> 01:08.827
- Yep.
- So...

01:08.931 --> 01:11.862
basically, we're-we're
playing Holy Word tomorrow.

01:11.965 --> 01:14.896
No way. Tomorrow. Wow.
That takes me back.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.758
- Yeah, so it got me thinking...
- So, we were down

01:17.862 --> 01:19.758
with four minutes left
in the fourth quarter.

01:19.862 --> 01:24.241
And I look over, I see Hoyt
hauling downfield

01:24.344 --> 01:25.793
and I just throw
a perfect spiral.

01:25.896 --> 01:28.758
Bam, touchdown!
The rest is history.

01:28.862 --> 01:32.620
Oh, it's a slightly revisionist
history there, buddy.

01:32.724 --> 01:34.448
If Hoyt hadn't have
gotten that pick-six

01:34.551 --> 01:36.206
on the next drive,
we'd have never won.

01:36.310 --> 01:38.241
Yeah, yeah.
My point was

01:38.344 --> 01:40.586
that we won the game
and it brought us glory.

01:40.689 --> 01:42.551
Yeah, right, right.

01:42.655 --> 01:46.310
So, um, you know, like,
the afternoon of the big game

01:46.413 --> 01:49.344
- they have this, like, alum-
student flag football thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:49.448 --> 01:51.137
Seniors versus juniors
with alumni on their teams?

01:51.241 --> 01:54.000
Sure, yeah, I remember that. The
winners get a skip day, right?

01:54.103 --> 01:55.413
Yeah, so, I mean,

01:55.517 --> 01:57.034
you know,
since we actually have a shot

01:57.137 --> 01:58.275
at beating Holy Word

01:58.379 --> 01:59.931
for the first time
since, you know,

02:00.034 --> 02:01.206
you were playing
in the Dark Ages...

02:01.310 --> 02:03.689
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
- Wow!

02:03.793 --> 02:06.689
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No offense.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.448
Maybe you could play
with the juniors,

02:08.551 --> 02:10.586
you know,
give the guys some good vibes.

02:10.689 --> 02:12.827
It'd help me out.
What do you say?

02:12.931 --> 02:14.413
Love to, buddy. Hey, listen,

02:14.517 --> 02:15.793
Captain James is giving us
an assignment,

02:15.896 --> 02:17.413
and I'm not sure
what it's going to be,

02:17.517 --> 02:19.275
but if I can be there tomorrow,

02:19.379 --> 02:22.379
I will be there tomorrow.
I just can't promise.

02:22.482 --> 02:24.172
This is going to be awesome.

02:24.965 --> 02:28.000
Look, I'm gonna try my best
to make it tomorrow,

02:28.103 --> 02:30.379
but I'm just not sure what
the gig's gonna shake out to be.

02:30.482 --> 02:32.137
It'll break her heart.

02:32.241 --> 02:33.758
Whose heart are we breaking?

02:33.862 --> 02:35.896
- Mm, our grandma.
- Ah.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.172
It's the centennial of our
family's restaurant up in Waco.

02:38.275 --> 02:42.103
It kinda became a thing.
She had her own show.

02:42.206 --> 02:44.586
She's like
our personal Julia Child.

02:44.689 --> 02:46.413
Wait, wait.
This feels huge.

02:46.517 --> 02:48.551
Which is exactly why
Cassie needs to be there.

02:48.655 --> 02:50.000
You don't want to get the whole

02:50.103 --> 02:51.413
"I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed" speech.

02:51.517 --> 02:52.965
Oh, definitely not.

02:53.793 --> 02:58.000
Why don't you bring Liam?
Just in case I can't make it.

02:58.103 --> 03:01.137
I mean, yeah,
I'd love to meet your family.

03:01.931 --> 03:05.241
Yeah, although
it is kind of early.

03:05.896 --> 03:07.827
Lucas didn't meet her
for like a year.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.103
But that was fine.

03:10.206 --> 03:12.241
Was it-- was it bad or...?

03:12.344 --> 03:14.620
No, it was great,

03:14.724 --> 03:17.103
but it was the first boyfriend
he brought home...

03:17.206 --> 03:19.586
Why are you here again?

03:19.689 --> 03:21.241
Yes,
why are all of you here?

03:21.344 --> 03:23.241
- Hey, Keesha.

03:23.344 --> 03:25.482
- Good morning.
- I thought you lived
down the hall.

03:25.586 --> 03:27.172
Across the hall, actually.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.517
We brought food
because we can't be

03:28.620 --> 03:30.862
- at the actual ceremony.
- I see.

03:32.137 --> 03:34.448
Y'all ready for
the Trey Barnett show?

03:34.551 --> 03:36.344
- Look who it is.
- Whoo!

03:36.448 --> 03:39.068
I don't know if Mama's ready.

03:40.206 --> 03:41.931
Sorry, Mama.

03:52.931 --> 03:55.310
What, did it finally get
too hot for you

03:55.413 --> 03:57.103
to go out running
on the surface of the sun?

03:57.206 --> 03:58.379
Hey.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.413
Yeah, yeah.
Something like that.

04:02.517 --> 04:06.000
Uh, Cap, you got
that assignment for us?

04:06.103 --> 04:07.344
Yeah. Yeah, got a request in
from up the ladder.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.689
You know we've been helping out

04:08.793 --> 04:10.689
with the more sensitive
evidence runs

04:10.793 --> 04:12.275
ever since last year's issues?

04:12.379 --> 04:15.655
Yeah. The truck
with Serrano's evidence?

04:15.758 --> 04:17.793
Yeah, you guys drew
the short straw.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.206
- Where we going?
- You're picking up

04:20.310 --> 04:22.068
at a crime lab near Dallas,
bringing it back down here.

04:22.172 --> 04:25.655
- Dallas office isn't handling?
- No. Origin jurisdiction.

04:25.758 --> 04:27.137
So, you know the drill, right?

04:27.241 --> 04:28.379
Keep the evidence
in your custody.

04:28.482 --> 04:29.724
If you got to stop--
potty break,

04:29.827 --> 04:31.517
snacks, whatever--
just maintain the chain.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.448
- Yes, sir.
- It'll be ready
for pickup tomorrow.

04:33.551 --> 04:35.413
Have it delivered by midnight
and you're good.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.068
- Okay.
- Hey.

04:37.172 --> 04:39.241
We're getting ready to start.
You might want to...

04:39.344 --> 04:42.517
Yeah, shower.
Yep. Yep.

04:53.482 --> 04:56.310
Okay, this guy...

04:57.103 --> 04:58.758
...throughout his training,

04:58.862 --> 05:00.448
he proved
time and time again

05:00.551 --> 05:02.413
that he has more
than what it takes.

05:02.517 --> 05:06.413
We are stronger
with him in our ranks.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.896
Y'all know
I like to keep it short,

05:10.000 --> 05:11.793
so let me just finish
by saying that

05:11.896 --> 05:14.724
this is truly one of the
greatest honors of my career.

05:15.931 --> 05:19.172
Congratulations,
Ranger Trey Barnett.

05:28.413 --> 05:29.896
Hey!

05:35.482 --> 05:36.517
All right.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.827
Let's do this.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.103
Thank you, sir.

05:45.896 --> 05:48.689
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

05:52.655 --> 05:54.344
Way to go.
Welcome to the family, Trey.

05:54.448 --> 05:55.896
My man.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.448
Is this a good time to ask
about carpooling to work?

05:57.551 --> 05:58.965
Thank you, everyone.

05:59.068 --> 06:01.827
Thank you. Seriously.
This is a true honor.

06:01.931 --> 06:04.068
- Oh, thank you.
- All right.

06:11.344 --> 06:14.206
All right, let's get
back to work.

06:32.655 --> 06:34.000
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Nope.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.000
We have had six hours
of calming auras

06:36.103 --> 06:38.724
and that absolutely wild
guided meditation

06:38.827 --> 06:40.172
by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.689
Okay, you don't have
to say his whole name.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.310
I do.
It's a sign of respect.

06:44.413 --> 06:46.103
But enough is enough.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.103
It is DJ Cassie's turn.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.758
Oh, good.

06:49.862 --> 06:51.655
Let's see.

06:51.758 --> 06:54.103
You know, the two of us
on a little road trip,

06:54.206 --> 06:55.586
snacks galore,

06:55.689 --> 06:57.862
little bit of mysterious
evidence in the back,

06:57.965 --> 06:59.758
it's a nice change
of pace from...

06:59.862 --> 07:02.206
From, what,
kidnappings and trauma?

07:02.310 --> 07:03.310
For starters.

07:03.413 --> 07:04.862
But, yeah,

07:04.965 --> 07:07.758
even if that means
we both miss family stuff,

07:07.862 --> 07:10.620
and speaking of family,
your brother misses you.

07:12.758 --> 07:14.620
And I'm glad we get
to start a new chapter

07:14.724 --> 07:16.862
and catch up
on the scenic route.

07:16.965 --> 07:18.241
- It's nice.
- Hmm.

07:19.068 --> 07:22.517
Really nice. It would be perfect
if you could silence your phone.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.103
I mean, who is texting you
nonstop?

07:24.206 --> 07:25.379
I thought it was you.

07:25.482 --> 07:27.241
- Me?
- Yeah. I was trying to be nice

07:27.344 --> 07:30.137
because, I mean, yeah, hello,
that is incredibly annoying.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.551
- Incredibly annoying.
- Then what the hell is it?

07:32.655 --> 07:34.620
I-I don't know.

07:34.724 --> 07:37.586
What? Cass, what? What is it?

07:37.689 --> 07:39.344
It's coming from in there.

07:44.655 --> 07:46.344
I feel it in my bones, man.

07:46.448 --> 07:49.482
We win with this last QB
to defeat Holy Word on our team?

07:49.586 --> 07:51.344
That takes us to dub-city,
my friends.

07:51.448 --> 07:52.689
Seriously, bro.
It's perfect.

07:52.793 --> 07:54.241
Boys, listen,
skip day, all right.

07:54.344 --> 07:57.172
Paintball, the lake.
Possibilities are endless.

what I was expecting

08:07.241 --> 08:09.344
being back here,
but it wasn't whatever this is.

08:09.448 --> 08:12.931
The nostalgia factor takes time.

08:13.931 --> 08:17.034
Geraldine Broussard.
Oh, my God.

08:18.551 --> 08:21.241
Oh, my gosh. Becca Ferguson. Wow.

- Stella Walker.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.655
Already visiting from college?

08:26.758 --> 08:30.275
It's crazy.
I could have been your mom.

08:31.379 --> 08:36.310
So, uh, are you still in--
what was it-- pharma sales?

08:36.413 --> 08:38.413
It's biomedical technology.

08:38.517 --> 08:39.862
Oh, right.

08:39.965 --> 08:41.551
I just wanted
to stop by and say

08:41.655 --> 08:43.034
how inspiring it is
to see you here.

08:43.137 --> 08:44.931
Year after year,
so bravely,

08:45.034 --> 08:46.862

that's happened.

08:46.965 --> 08:49.068

A meat bouquet?

09:03.862 --> 09:05.482
- Mm.
- Who's it from?

09:05.586 --> 09:07.172
Micki.

09:08.413 --> 09:10.068
Where is she anyway?

09:10.172 --> 09:13.862
She's, uh, heading
to New Orleans with her moms.

09:17.965 --> 09:19.758
Listen, Ma,
I think you got to try that.

09:19.862 --> 09:21.379
I finally nailed it.

09:21.482 --> 09:25.655
All right, let's see what
you're working with, then, son.

09:28.379 --> 09:29.551
Mmm.

09:29.655 --> 09:31.655
<i>C'est bon, Trey.</i>

09:31.758 --> 09:34.344
- Ah, merci, Mama, merci.
- Wow.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.689
My God.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.068
So we're wearing hats
inside now, huh?

09:40.137 --> 09:42.896
My bad.
I'm excited.

09:44.137 --> 09:45.724
Your grandma
would be proud of this.

09:45.827 --> 09:48.965
Tastes just how I remember.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.379
All right,
talk to me, Ma.

09:56.482 --> 09:57.758
Mm-mm. Don't do that.

09:57.862 --> 10:01.379
Don't go therapizing me,
Trey Barnett.

10:01.482 --> 10:03.068
You moved on from that.

10:03.172 --> 10:06.275
You're gonna have to give me
something, Ma.

10:06.379 --> 10:08.655
I mean, how else am I supposed
to know how to fix this

10:08.758 --> 10:10.448
if I don't know what's wrong?

10:12.344 --> 10:13.620
It's Captain James.

10:13.724 --> 10:16.689
Sorry.
Just give me one second.

10:16.793 --> 10:19.827
Hey, what's up, Cap?

10:19.931 --> 10:22.379
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, for sure. All right.

10:22.482 --> 10:25.137
We'll see you then. Yeah.

10:26.172 --> 10:26.896
Sorry about that.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.379
What was that about?

10:28.482 --> 10:30.758
We got to swing by HQ on the way
to the mayor's event

10:30.862 --> 10:33.655
that we have tonight,
if that's okay.

10:34.689 --> 10:37.413
I better start
getting ready, then.

10:37.517 --> 10:39.758
Wha...?

10:42.034 --> 10:43.931
We're just going
to leave this here?

10:45.896 --> 10:47.275
What's in the box?

10:47.379 --> 10:48.931
No, no. You stay back.

10:49.034 --> 10:50.862
Wait, are you thinking bomb?

10:50.965 --> 10:53.586
Well, you're spooked, too.

10:53.689 --> 10:56.206
Yeah, but the lab
and the point officer

10:56.310 --> 10:58.758
obviously would have swept
for anything suspicious.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.034
Okay. Yeah, right, then
tell me it's impossible.

11:04.068 --> 11:05.517
Exactly. You can't.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.965
- It could be anything.
- And it could be dangerous.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.413
We don't even know
what this case is related to.

11:10.517 --> 11:12.931
So it could be a tracker
or a kitchen timer,

11:13.034 --> 11:14.448
or it could be a damn Furby.

11:14.551 --> 11:16.862
Yeah, I'm gonna call James
and the bomb squad.

11:16.965 --> 11:19.551
I-I guess I'm not gonna call
James and the bomb squad.

11:19.655 --> 11:20.896
I don't have any service.
Have you?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.310
- Great.
- We should've brought a radio.

11:22.413 --> 11:23.655
Yeah.

11:25.034 --> 11:26.862
All right, well,
you're the ranking officer.

11:26.965 --> 11:28.655
What do we do?

11:28.758 --> 11:33.103
All right, so the beeping
makes me think it's on a timer,

11:33.206 --> 11:35.551
not a pressure trigger,
but opening the case

11:35.655 --> 11:37.724
could compromise whatever
investigation it's linked to.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.413
Yeah, okay.

11:39.517 --> 11:41.137
Off your timer theory,

11:41.241 --> 11:42.965
not opening it
could get us blown up.

11:43.068 --> 11:46.137
- So, not ideal. Yeah.
- Not ideal. Yeah.

11:47.344 --> 11:48.862
- So...
- So...

11:50.793 --> 11:54.172
So, uh, we're doing this.

12:25.103 --> 12:27.517
Well, at least
we didn't go boom.

12:27.620 --> 12:28.862
Yeah.

12:33.172 --> 12:35.965
At least, uh,
we didn't go boom.

12:36.068 --> 12:41.206
No, DEFCON 5 for a bunch
of cheap plastic watches.

12:41.310 --> 12:43.965
And no service so I can't even
text Augie good luck

12:44.068 --> 12:45.758
on his flag football game.

12:45.862 --> 12:48.068
Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

12:48.172 --> 12:49.793
Walker, how could we have known?

12:49.896 --> 12:53.034
Huh, alarms are all set
for 1400 hours.

12:55.655 --> 12:57.344
Every day at the same time,
the mercenaries

12:57.448 --> 13:01.241
would, uh, would-would come
and, uh, come and take us.

13:02.172 --> 13:05.413
Julia, the other prisoner,
above me, the journalist.

13:05.517 --> 13:09.137
She was keeping track
long before I got there.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.931
Every day at the same time,
they would, uh...

13:14.034 --> 13:15.862
- Right.
- Right.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.206
I guess the mercs
had a name.

13:24.034 --> 13:25.931
"Grey Flag." Huh.

13:28.172 --> 13:31.103
All right.
We should get back on the road.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.000
What the hell's this?

13:47.379 --> 13:48.931
Hey.

13:49.034 --> 13:51.551
It was really weird
of Becca to say that

13:51.655 --> 13:53.172
about being your mom.

13:53.275 --> 13:56.000
And everything else
that she said, really.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.896
Yeah, that was gross,
but whatever.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
It's that four months ago,

14:03.103 --> 14:05.103
these were my stomping grounds,

14:05.206 --> 14:07.965
and now it feels icky somehow.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.241
Yeah, I get that.

14:10.344 --> 14:12.448
I think it's just going
to take you a little while

14:12.551 --> 14:14.586
to figure out your routine,
but you'll get there.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.068
I just don't want to be

14:16.172 --> 14:18.413
that weird alumni
who's always around.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.758
I didn't mean--
I-I was not thinking.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.103
Total word vomit.

14:24.206 --> 14:27.068
It's fine. It's fine.

14:27.172 --> 14:29.068
I was actually thinking
about this earlier.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.931
You know that conversation

14:31.034 --> 14:32.931
that we had about dreams
and whatnot?

14:33.034 --> 14:35.103
I don't know
if you know this,

14:35.206 --> 14:38.827
but I was supposed to go
to business school,

14:38.931 --> 14:41.931
and then life got in the way.

14:42.034 --> 14:44.965
My dad died
and he left me the Side Step.

14:45.068 --> 14:47.620
And, you know,
it wasn't my plan,

14:47.724 --> 14:50.275
but it was the hand
that life dealt me.

14:50.379 --> 14:53.068
And it's what keeps
a roof over my head.

14:53.172 --> 14:57.137
Kind of like how
it's doing for you right now.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.758
Deciding not to go
to college was huge.

15:00.862 --> 15:04.655
And I just feel like
there's more hard choices now.

15:04.758 --> 15:08.448
I thought I'd figure it out
faster, is all.

15:08.551 --> 15:12.724
Well, Stel, part of being a
grown-up is owning your choices.

15:12.827 --> 15:15.793
And you're really lucky
that you have a safety net

15:15.896 --> 15:17.862
while you figure it all out.

15:17.965 --> 15:19.517
'Cause not most people do.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.448
I think if you just try to focus
on the bigger picture,

15:22.551 --> 15:24.034
I know it's hard,

15:24.137 --> 15:25.758
but stop thinking about
the little things.

15:25.862 --> 15:28.310
You're gonna save yourself
a lot of heartache.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.206
Hey, how do you know
when it's ready?

15:37.310 --> 15:38.586
Well, you know how
in chemistry class

15:38.689 --> 15:40.206
when you would work
with acids and bases

15:40.310 --> 15:42.344
and you would use titration
to get whatever

15:42.448 --> 15:44.517
that concoction was
to turn a different color?

15:44.620 --> 15:45.724
Vaguely, yeah.

15:45.827 --> 15:47.034
So that means?

15:47.137 --> 15:49.241
I failed chemistry in college.

15:49.344 --> 15:51.482
Oh, so we're winging it?
All right.

15:51.586 --> 15:53.275
Why didn't you call me,
<i>mijo?</i>

15:53.379 --> 15:55.034
I would have come over earlier.

15:55.137 --> 15:58.344
They said you were busy and
mentioned we needed more sauce.

15:58.448 --> 16:01.896
But I want to introduce you
to my-- uh, to Liam.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.620
Oh, good to meet you.

16:03.724 --> 16:05.689
It is so nice
to meet you finally.

16:05.793 --> 16:07.965
And congratulations
on everything.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.413
Thank you.

16:09.517 --> 16:11.103
And I hope you have
a great time tonight.

16:11.206 --> 16:12.793
Oh, I'm sure that I will.

16:12.896 --> 16:14.586
We just watched your episode
last night on <i>Passion Pit,</i>

16:14.689 --> 16:16.586
and everything
just looks amazing.

16:16.689 --> 16:20.275
Well, then
maybe you can convince Ben

16:20.379 --> 16:23.448
to come over to see me
a little more often.

16:23.551 --> 16:26.034
I'm sorry.
Things have been crazy.

16:26.137 --> 16:27.862
Crazy good, though.

16:27.965 --> 16:30.344
You know, a major distillery
gave Ben the exclusive

16:30.448 --> 16:32.448
on a limited batch
for their reserve barrels.

16:32.551 --> 16:33.862
Oh, really?

16:33.965 --> 16:35.034
Well, then I wouldn't mind

16:35.137 --> 16:36.586
if a bottle fell off the truck.

16:36.689 --> 16:39.482
I think
we can do better than that.

16:39.586 --> 16:42.965
Oh, Lucas.
You've got to watch this.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.896
It's actually...

16:45.000 --> 16:46.206
I-I got it.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.758
Yeah.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.827
Oh, this is weird.

17:01.931 --> 17:06.448
Look, compared to Miles,
Fenton was their inside guy,

17:06.551 --> 17:09.620
and his file starts halfway
through his time as a Ranger.

17:09.724 --> 17:13.275
Okay, well, you know,
Miles was an outsider, so...

17:13.379 --> 17:17.206
Yeah, but, no,
here, look, see,

17:17.310 --> 17:19.068
yours is kind of insane.

17:19.172 --> 17:23.758
You've got
military discharge papers.

17:23.862 --> 17:25.344
Stella's birth.

17:25.448 --> 17:27.758
There's all these scribbles,
tons of notes.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.758
Dental records.

17:29.862 --> 17:32.344
It's like Grey Flag
was obsessed.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.413
Hmm.

17:34.517 --> 17:37.172
Guess these must be the files
that Sean was quoting to me.

17:37.275 --> 17:38.827
I mean,
it makes perfect sense, Cass.

17:38.931 --> 17:40.724
You know, them having all this
info. It's classic psyops.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.172
- Right, but still...
- But still nothing.

17:43.275 --> 17:44.862
It doesn't matter.

17:44.965 --> 17:48.551
You know, Grey Flag,
they're all finished, locked up.

17:49.586 --> 17:51.310
What?

17:51.413 --> 17:53.655
"Cassie was a Ranger,
Cassie loses partner,

17:53.758 --> 17:55.448
"Cassie freaks out,

17:55.551 --> 17:57.758
And Cassie gets duped
by douchebag Sean."

17:57.862 --> 18:01.137
Yeah, it is not even worth
a second page.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.517
Wow.

18:02.620 --> 18:06.000
This really makes
my life seem sad.

18:06.103 --> 18:08.241
Cass, maybe it's because

18:08.344 --> 18:10.551
you haven't been
a Ranger very long.

18:10.655 --> 18:13.241
Again.
Dental records.

18:13.344 --> 18:16.758
Okay, again, we are--
uh, we're done with this.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.620
- Wait, what?
- This is pointless.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.931
Cass, I mean,
these files are nothing

18:21.034 --> 18:24.068
but a bunch of Looney Tunes
thinking they're MI-6.

18:24.172 --> 18:28.103
And we are
going to prove them wrong.

18:28.206 --> 18:31.275
The first stop,
Perez Prime Cuts.

18:31.379 --> 18:33.172
I hear it's an anniversary.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.000
Wait, wait, hold up,
what about the evidence?

18:35.103 --> 18:36.689
You heard James.

18:36.793 --> 18:38.379
It only has to be delivered
by midnight tonight,

18:38.482 --> 18:39.896
and it will be.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.965
You're serious?

18:41.068 --> 18:42.137
As a heart attack.

18:44.344 --> 18:46.517
The delivery can wait,

18:46.620 --> 18:49.275
but starting this whole
"trauma-less chapter,"

18:49.379 --> 18:51.275
as you put it, cannot.

18:53.827 --> 18:55.793
So...

18:55.896 --> 18:57.586
brisket?

18:57.689 --> 18:59.517
Brisket.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.344
Ah, yes!

19:17.793 --> 19:21.172
I still cannot believe that
this is your family's place.

19:21.275 --> 19:24.896
- Yeah.
- And you never told me
you're Texas barbecue royalty.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.517
I mean, it's almost hurtful.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.241
Well, there's a lot of things
you don't know.

19:28.344 --> 19:29.655
Oh, yeah?

19:29.758 --> 19:31.275
There she is.

19:34.137 --> 19:35.655
Guess who.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.586
Hey, don't you scare
an old lady like that.

19:39.689 --> 19:42.655
Oh, I couldn't resist.
I've missed you.

19:42.758 --> 19:43.931
Oh, honey.

19:44.034 --> 19:47.896
Ooh, and who is
this handsome young man?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.206
- Oh.
- And tall, too.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.655
This is my partner
Cordell Walker.

19:53.758 --> 19:54.862
Liam's brother.

19:54.965 --> 19:57.068
The famous
Ranger Cordell Walker.

19:57.172 --> 19:59.275
You're always in the news.

19:59.379 --> 20:02.034
Okay, well, ma'am,
just Walker is fine,

20:02.137 --> 20:04.655
And believe you me, I'd love
to stay out of the news.

20:04.758 --> 20:07.379
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Oh, thank you.

20:07.482 --> 20:09.724
- Make yourself at home.
- You bet.

20:09.827 --> 20:11.793
Eat. Both of you, eat.

20:11.896 --> 20:14.034
Oh, we are gonna eat.
Just wanted to see you first.

20:14.137 --> 20:15.896
Also... h-hold on a second.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.310
Is that, is that a headshot?

20:18.413 --> 20:20.413
Were you a child star
or something?

20:20.517 --> 20:21.689
Strictly local.

20:21.793 --> 20:24.103
No, man, this place is
a gold mine.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.344
Okay, let's not.

20:25.448 --> 20:28.896
Oh, no, no, I,
I think we should.

20:38.689 --> 20:40.827
Uh, yeah.
I-I'm gonna need a few hours,

20:40.931 --> 20:44.137
but, uh... okay, yeah.
Send me the details.

20:44.241 --> 20:46.413
Bye.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.758
- Hey, everything okay?
- Hey.

20:48.862 --> 20:51.172
Whoa, I thought
it was no contact.

20:51.275 --> 20:54.137
Yeah, it's supposed to be low
contact, but I got all of it.

20:54.241 --> 20:55.827
Yeah.

20:55.931 --> 20:59.620
Uh, hey, Stel, I, uh, I got
to go take care of something.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.586
So I'm gonna have
someone come here,

21:01.689 --> 21:04.379
help you pack all this stuff up,
and once you're done,

21:04.482 --> 21:06.206
just consider yourself off
for the night.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.000
We're not opening
on a Friday night?

21:08.103 --> 21:10.758
It's not ideal, but, yeah.

21:10.862 --> 21:15.000
I mean, we're already closed,
so I'll keep in touch, okay?

21:15.103 --> 21:19.620
Hey, I'm sorry
Dad bailed on the game.

21:19.724 --> 21:22.275
He's been trying really hard
to show up for us lately.

21:22.379 --> 21:23.896
Yeah, show up for you maybe.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.551
What does that mean?

21:25.655 --> 21:27.655
It's whatever.
Stella, I'm used to it.

21:27.758 --> 21:30.379
And, um, you know, who needs
friends or a skip day anyway?

21:30.482 --> 21:33.068
W-W-Wait. I'm off now

21:33.172 --> 21:34.931
since the Side Step is closed.

21:35.034 --> 21:37.448
Why don't you come hang out
with Colton and me?

21:37.551 --> 21:38.793
There's, like, one of these

21:38.896 --> 21:41.413
sing-along things
at the Drafthouse.

21:43.413 --> 21:46.034
You really don't get it,
do you?

21:46.724 --> 21:48.758
Whatever, Stella.
Enjoy your movie.

21:50.551 --> 21:52.620
I can do better
than a skip day.

21:52.724 --> 21:55.793
What's up, boys?

22:03.103 --> 22:04.655
Hey, hey.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.172
Hey. Come on in,

22:07.275 --> 22:10.448
- Captain.
- How's Austin treating you,
Keesha?

22:10.551 --> 22:12.379
Oh, hot as hell, just like home.

22:12.482 --> 22:14.068
Yeah, you're not,
you're not wrong. Have a seat.

22:14.172 --> 22:15.517
Thank you.

22:15.620 --> 22:19.965
- Okay.
- What's up, Cap?

22:20.068 --> 22:21.620
When I was first coming up,

22:21.724 --> 22:23.206
there was this brother
named Willy Lamb.

22:23.310 --> 22:25.275
He was like, you know,
old-school cool,

22:25.379 --> 22:26.827
tough as nails,

22:26.931 --> 22:30.310
one of only
a few Black Rangers.

22:30.413 --> 22:32.137
He was stationed up north.

22:32.241 --> 22:36.310
When I got my star,
he drove through the night

22:36.413 --> 22:39.137
just to see them pin it on me

22:39.241 --> 22:41.931
and he gave me this.

22:57.344 --> 22:59.448
Cap...

23:02.758 --> 23:05.310
Willy had it made
to kind of set himself apart,

23:05.413 --> 23:08.620
not that
he needed any help doing that,

23:08.724 --> 23:10.551
but it was his way
of saying,

23:10.655 --> 23:13.931
"I'm one of you, I'm here.
You know?

23:14.034 --> 23:15.931
I ain't going anywhere."

23:20.551 --> 23:22.448
Thank you.

23:22.551 --> 23:27.068
I mean, this,
this is just... Wow.

23:27.689 --> 23:30.137
Hey, you earned your spot, man.

23:30.241 --> 23:32.793
This is just a little something
to remind you

23:32.896 --> 23:36.275
that there's more to it
than the day-to-day, you know?

23:36.379 --> 23:39.482
Yeah. Yeah.
There's history.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.896
That's right, a legacy,
one that you're a part of

23:43.000 --> 23:45.931
and one that I know
you're going to live up to.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.068
Yes, sir.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.827
Coast is clear.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.482
Oh, check this out.

24:15.586 --> 24:16.827
Yo, pass the cups.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.344
- Kegs are dry.
- I got this.

24:42.448 --> 24:44.586
- Yo, give me a hand, Scoot.
- Yeah.

24:47.965 --> 24:49.862
<i>♪ Catch me if you can♪</i>

24:53.172 --> 24:55.068
Whoa.

24:55.172 --> 24:57.689
Yeah, you know, sometimes
the gas lines get a bit funky,

24:57.793 --> 25:00.172
I just have
to change the kegs out.

25:02.103 --> 25:03.655
Dude, how do you know
all this?

25:03.758 --> 25:06.413
Well, one of the perks
of owning a bar, I guess.

25:06.517 --> 25:10.137
Cool, we'll just
switch out the kegs.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.931
There we go.

25:22.931 --> 25:25.655
Hey! Guys, we're in here,
we're stuck.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.034
<i>♪ Catch me if you can.♪</i>

25:38.689 --> 25:40.758
- Hey there.
- Hey.

25:40.862 --> 25:43.724
- You mind?
- No, please sit.

25:49.896 --> 25:53.344
You know, uh, man, I guess
it was about a year ago,

25:53.448 --> 25:55.551
I was with your son

25:55.655 --> 25:59.103
and the next thing I knew,
boom, I was shot.

25:59.206 --> 26:01.241
Twice.

26:01.344 --> 26:03.344
I'm fully recovered now,

26:03.448 --> 26:07.448
but I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Trey.

26:07.551 --> 26:10.103
He saved my life.

26:15.103 --> 26:19.103
Captain,
do you have any kids?

26:19.206 --> 26:20.482
I do, yeah.

26:20.586 --> 26:23.448
DJ.
He's up at Boise State.

26:24.206 --> 26:27.172
Look, I worry
about my kid constantly,

26:27.275 --> 26:28.724
I do,

26:28.827 --> 26:31.517
but I'm not going to pretend
that our worries

26:31.620 --> 26:34.482
for our sons are the same,
you know?

26:34.586 --> 26:36.724
I mean,
that look on your face--

26:36.827 --> 26:39.689
exact same look my mom had.

26:39.793 --> 26:42.724
I'll never forget it.

26:43.862 --> 26:46.724
I'm not trying to tell you
how to feel, okay?

26:46.827 --> 26:49.448
I just hope
you can come to understand

26:49.551 --> 26:52.068
the decision
that your son has made

26:52.172 --> 26:56.965
and know that he's...
he's special.

26:57.068 --> 27:00.689
My two favorite people.
Is everything all right?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.655
Everything is golden.

27:05.344 --> 27:06.896
I'm gonna head over.
I'll see you guys there.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.931
Captain. Thank you.

27:10.034 --> 27:11.482
You can call me Larry.

27:11.586 --> 27:13.310
And you're welcome.

27:14.137 --> 27:16.793
- Can I call you Larry?
- No.

27:22.034 --> 27:25.827
You know, the last time
I was here, I found peace.

27:27.206 --> 27:29.482
You had the house,

27:29.586 --> 27:32.862
the girl, the safe job.

27:32.965 --> 27:36.448
Ma, why didn't
you tell me this before?

27:36.551 --> 27:39.931
Because you're grown, Trey,
but I'm telling you now.

27:40.034 --> 27:44.344
It was hard raising you
while your father went career.

27:44.448 --> 27:49.827
I know the history,
and a lot of it's ugly.

27:50.896 --> 27:52.965
But my decision
was about that man:

27:53.068 --> 27:55.379
Captain James
and his vision.

27:55.482 --> 27:58.275
Cassie, Walker, and James,

27:58.379 --> 28:01.000
they have my back.

28:02.241 --> 28:06.241
I just pray that you do, too.

28:06.344 --> 28:08.275
Of course I do.

28:08.379 --> 28:11.103
It's just, Trey...

28:11.206 --> 28:13.000
You need time.

28:24.034 --> 28:25.793
Maybe just a little.

28:27.689 --> 28:29.413
Come on, Ma.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.862
I don't know,
I-I guess I just wanted

28:45.965 --> 28:48.517
to make it out of high school
alive, you know?

28:48.620 --> 28:52.586
Damn.
That's... dark.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.206
I'm sorry.
It's just...

28:55.310 --> 28:57.620
It's been really fun
hanging out with you guys,

28:57.724 --> 28:59.206
but I know I'm just

28:59.310 --> 29:01.793
Stella's weird little brother
to everyone.

29:01.896 --> 29:03.793
Dude, you guys were a force,

29:03.896 --> 29:05.758
plus you had
a band with seniors.

29:05.862 --> 29:07.758
Always with upperclassmen.

29:07.862 --> 29:10.482
Does surgery on his uncle
in his bedroom.

29:10.586 --> 29:12.482
Bro, you're badass.

29:12.586 --> 29:15.275
- I didn't think
we stood a chance.
- What?

29:15.379 --> 29:16.862
You literally just said
you wanted

29:16.965 --> 29:18.310
to make it out
of high school alive.

29:18.413 --> 29:22.379
And not, like, in a dramatic
way. You meant it.

29:22.482 --> 29:24.448
Well, I mean,
when you put it that way...

29:24.551 --> 29:27.206
I'm just glad
to know we were wrong

29:27.310 --> 29:29.862
about you
being up on a high horse.

29:29.965 --> 29:32.310
Turns out,
you are kinda crazy, though.

29:32.413 --> 29:35.068
We broke into a bar
your Ranger dad owns

29:35.172 --> 29:36.793
and are drinking it dry...

29:39.172 --> 29:41.344
What the hell was that?

29:41.448 --> 29:44.137
They'll get our texts
any minute and let us out.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.344
Oh, man.

29:46.448 --> 29:48.000
Relax.

29:48.103 --> 29:49.517
You've got this. It's cool.

29:49.620 --> 29:54.482
I still hope you feel that way
in about an hour.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.034
You know, I've been thinking
about earlier.

30:15.137 --> 30:17.517
Hi.

30:17.620 --> 30:19.241
About all of it.

30:19.344 --> 30:20.413
Yeah.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.793
Mostly the dossiers.

30:22.896 --> 30:25.655
Cassie, these files,
they're just...

30:25.758 --> 30:27.310
Crazy Pants trading cards,
I know.

30:27.413 --> 30:29.275
- Yes. Exactly.
- But they're not wrong.

30:29.379 --> 30:33.206
For so long I was
just living for the job.

30:33.310 --> 30:35.379
Well, as you know,
work-life balance

30:35.482 --> 30:37.137
isn't exactly
my strong suit either,

30:37.241 --> 30:39.862
but finding
that sweet spot takes time.

30:39.965 --> 30:43.103
I think just seeing it
all laid out like that

30:43.206 --> 30:46.896
was the kick in the ass
I needed to do more.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Refocus my life or whatever.

30:51.103 --> 30:52.724
Okay,
that can all start right now.

30:52.827 --> 30:55.275
Sometimes all you need
is family.

30:55.379 --> 30:57.724
Is that why
you've been tiptoeing

30:57.827 --> 30:59.655
around your brother all night?

30:59.758 --> 31:01.586
All right. Touché.

31:03.137 --> 31:06.103
Well,
maybe now's your chance.

31:08.896 --> 31:10.137
Stinker.

31:10.241 --> 31:12.931
I'm going to go clear this.

31:13.034 --> 31:15.310
- Do you want me to...
- Uh, sure. Please.

31:15.413 --> 31:17.172
Thank you.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.241
Perfect. Uh...

31:20.344 --> 31:23.241
- How you doing? Good?
- I don't know.

31:23.344 --> 31:25.862
I feel like Ben
doesn't really want me here.

31:25.965 --> 31:29.068
His grandma
keeps confusing me for Lucas.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.862
I don't know if I can
really make sense of things.

31:31.965 --> 31:34.310
Can I give you
a bit of advice?

31:34.413 --> 31:35.931
Sure.

31:36.034 --> 31:38.551
Sometimes when
you're in a relationship,

31:38.655 --> 31:41.034
you can tend to go with the flow

31:41.137 --> 31:43.103
and try and ignore
the little things,

31:43.206 --> 31:45.931
but those little things
can add up.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.068
Why don't you just talk to him?

31:48.172 --> 31:50.896
You really
are doing better, huh?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.931
I'm getting there.

31:54.034 --> 31:57.655
- You?
- Not quite.

31:57.758 --> 31:59.000
Grew up on the ranch,

31:59.103 --> 32:00.482
I never gave the horses
a second thought.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.344
Now I need them for therapy--
they really help.

32:03.448 --> 32:05.482
- Good.
- You know, but, uh,

32:05.586 --> 32:07.793
I'm very far still
from better.

32:07.896 --> 32:11.793
I haven't really healed
keeping all the trauma inside.

32:11.896 --> 32:13.344
But out there I feel like,

32:13.448 --> 32:15.827
I don't know, I feel like
I can let some of it out.

32:15.931 --> 32:20.517
Good.
Hey, um, how about this?

32:20.620 --> 32:21.896
When you and I get home,

32:22.000 --> 32:25.103
we, uh...
we talk about it?

32:25.206 --> 32:28.793
We talk about
what we went through.

32:28.896 --> 32:33.448
Yeah.
I'd really like that.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.068
That's a date.

32:35.172 --> 32:36.862
Testing.

32:36.965 --> 32:39.344
Testing. Testing.

32:39.448 --> 32:41.655
We wanted to say
a few words

32:41.758 --> 32:45.551
as we celebrate 100 years
of Perez Prime Cuts.

32:52.586 --> 32:55.862
Back then
it was just one smoker,

32:55.965 --> 32:59.137
two recent immigrants
from Puerto Rico

32:59.241 --> 33:00.310
with a lot of promise.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.551
Ah, Puerto Rico.
<i>!¡Viva!</i>

33:04.241 --> 33:06.551
Our <i>abuela's</i> been
running it for decades,

33:06.655 --> 33:10.172
and we've been very lucky
to have a front row seat.

33:10.275 --> 33:14.413
She taught us all about
the value of hard work,

33:14.517 --> 33:15.793
about our roots,

33:15.896 --> 33:19.000
even though we weren't
always the best students.

33:21.206 --> 33:23.517
But when we started
a little tradition,

33:23.620 --> 33:25.551
she saw that
we were listening.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.206
Wait, what are you doing?

33:27.310 --> 33:30.000
Every weekend Cass and I
would put on a show.

33:30.103 --> 33:31.965
For tips, of course.

33:32.068 --> 33:34.137
Someone needed
their candy money.

33:34.241 --> 33:35.517

- Hmm?

35:32.413 --> 35:34.862
I have a feeling
I know what you're thinking.

35:34.965 --> 35:36.172
Um...

35:36.275 --> 35:38.344
What you said earlier about me

35:38.448 --> 35:40.965
and-and captivity...
you were right.

35:41.068 --> 35:45.000
I guess those kind of things
have a way of sticking with you.

35:45.103 --> 35:49.931
So the watches, the files--
it all made it rush back.

35:51.034 --> 35:54.379
But I am not going to let
past traumas rule my life.

35:54.482 --> 35:56.068
Fact is,
it's gonna happen again.

35:56.172 --> 35:58.896
You know, no matter what I do,
someone is going to come for me.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.758
I can't change that, but I can
change how I react to it.

36:02.862 --> 36:07.724
So, I've decided that I'm done
looking over my shoulder.

36:08.724 --> 36:12.137
I know you have the whole
boys club,

36:12.241 --> 36:16.000
capture-the-flag thing but,

36:16.103 --> 36:20.103
I'm happy to join you any time,

36:20.206 --> 36:24.310
running and frying
on a dirt road.

36:24.413 --> 36:27.137
- Okay. Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:27.241 --> 36:29.000
Okay, all right,
well, be careful,

36:29.103 --> 36:31.931
I might take you up on that.

36:32.034 --> 36:35.965
Hey, I hope you know
that you, uh, this,

36:36.068 --> 36:40.413
you know, our partnership,
it's really helped a lot.

36:44.586 --> 36:46.689
- So, the case.
- The case?

36:46.793 --> 36:49.275
Oh, the-the case.
The case, yeah, uh...

36:49.379 --> 36:51.103
It was signed into our custody

36:51.206 --> 36:52.551
and we never broke
chain of command.

36:52.655 --> 36:54.793
Bags were never opened,
we didn't tamper.

36:54.896 --> 36:57.344
No. Nothing we did could
compromise that evidence

36:57.448 --> 36:59.000
so it shouldn't compromise
our careers.

36:59.103 --> 37:00.862
I mean, it'd be a whole lot
of mess for nothing.

37:00.965 --> 37:04.172
I think we turn it in
and don't say a word.

37:06.793 --> 37:07.724
Okay.

37:07.827 --> 37:09.241
Okay. Yeah.

37:09.344 --> 37:10.413
This is between us.

37:10.517 --> 37:12.758
It's a promise.

37:15.241 --> 37:16.655
Hmm.

37:18.241 --> 37:19.482
Hello?

37:19.586 --> 37:21.137
<i>You have a call</i>

37:21.241 --> 37:22.965
<i>from the Austin Police
Department Holding from...</i>

37:23.068 --> 37:24.896
<i>August Walker.</i>

37:34.000 --> 37:36.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.482
Thanks.

37:41.241 --> 37:43.172
Things were weird today.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.724
I don't disagree.

37:50.758 --> 37:55.241
I've been thinking about
it all, overthinking really,

37:55.344 --> 37:58.793
just how I didn't
officially invite you here

37:58.896 --> 38:02.586
- and about the Lucas stuff...
- Ben...

38:02.689 --> 38:04.931
No, just let me finish, okay?

38:05.034 --> 38:06.379
Because dancing around it

38:06.482 --> 38:08.344
actually helped me
figure it out.

38:09.965 --> 38:12.034
We jumped into this.

38:12.137 --> 38:14.689
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.034
And then you got kidnapped,

38:18.137 --> 38:20.758
which is not something
I know how to talk about

38:20.862 --> 38:24.379
but also something
you have not talked about.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.068
I kind of... I feel like it's
between my brother and me,

38:30.172 --> 38:33.137
but this...

38:33.241 --> 38:34.724
this comes so easily.

38:34.827 --> 38:36.344
It did.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.068
So, you... saying you want
to take a break?

38:40.172 --> 38:41.551
No.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.068
God, no.

38:43.172 --> 38:45.758
I just think that we should
discuss what this is,

38:45.862 --> 38:47.586
what we are.

38:47.689 --> 38:51.034
And really how we can move
forward, given where you are.

38:51.137 --> 38:54.137
I hear you.

38:54.241 --> 38:56.206
I hear you. I do.

38:56.310 --> 38:58.482
What do you want?

39:00.655 --> 39:04.068
Well, I really like doing
this with you.

39:06.172 --> 39:08.172
The easy and the awkward

39:08.275 --> 39:11.068
and just trying to figure out
what this is.

39:12.827 --> 39:14.896
I don't want that to stop.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.896
I don't want it to stop either.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.379
<i>♪ For a
"further down the line"♪</i>

39:22.482 --> 39:24.551
<i>♪ We called it just in time.♪</i>

39:27.172 --> 39:28.551
Was it worth it?

39:28.655 --> 39:30.827
Getting put in here
for some clout?

39:30.931 --> 39:32.551
Oh, my God, Stella.
You know what?

39:32.655 --> 39:34.448
This is why
I wanted you to leave.

39:34.551 --> 39:37.448
How is any of this my fault?

39:37.551 --> 39:40.172
Look, I hear you
about so-called favoritism

39:40.275 --> 39:41.551
and I'm sorry, okay?

39:41.655 --> 39:44.379
But this, tonight,
you made a choice.

39:52.275 --> 39:53.551
You. Truck.

39:53.655 --> 39:55.689
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Don't. Don't.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.344
No. Later.

39:57.448 --> 40:00.379
- Get in the truck.
- Yes, sir.

40:15.758 --> 40:17.172
What the hell were you thinking?

40:17.275 --> 40:19.344
You should ask August.

40:21.206 --> 40:26.000
Stella, I've been trying
to be patient with you.

40:26.103 --> 40:29.275
You lied for months
about your mother's car.

40:29.379 --> 40:31.827
You roped in August on that,
then you drop this bombshell

40:31.931 --> 40:34.103
about not wanting
to go to college.

40:34.206 --> 40:37.000
And you know what?
I've been trying to be

40:37.103 --> 40:39.620
the cool modern dad
who rolls with the punches.

40:39.724 --> 40:41.793
It's your life.
You get to make the big choices.

40:41.896 --> 40:43.517
That's great.
I'm good with that.

40:43.620 --> 40:46.827
That's "cool." Right?
But now here we are.

40:46.931 --> 40:49.655
You threw another party
and ended up in jail again,

40:49.758 --> 40:52.172
but this time, you dragged
your brother into it as well.

40:52.275 --> 40:55.758
They saw kids doing donuts
in the parking lot

40:55.862 --> 40:57.517
and tossing bottles
into the streets.

40:57.620 --> 40:59.206
That is completely uncalled for.

40:59.310 --> 41:00.448
This is not my fault.

41:00.551 --> 41:02.068
I was just trying
to help August out

41:02.172 --> 41:04.137
- and then, bam,
the cops show up.
- Stella.

41:04.241 --> 41:06.827
No. Go out there
and ask him what happened.

41:07.793 --> 41:09.724
You got to believe me.

41:10.724 --> 41:14.172
How can I ever believe you again

41:14.275 --> 41:19.172
when all you've been doing
for months is lying to me?

41:19.275 --> 41:21.793
Dad.

41:22.586 --> 41:24.068
Please.

41:24.172 --> 41:26.448
No, don't, don't
"Dad, please" me. No.

41:26.551 --> 41:28.344
Stella, you're an adult now,

41:28.448 --> 41:31.655
and that means facing the
consequences of your actions,

41:31.758 --> 41:36.379
and that means you...

41:36.482 --> 41:38.000
are staying right there,

41:38.103 --> 41:41.172
in that cell by yourself.

41:41.275 --> 41:44.137
Maybe that will give you
some time to think.
