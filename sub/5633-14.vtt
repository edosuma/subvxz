00:00.934 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.507
Catch all-new episodes Sundays

00:11.612 --> 00:14.480
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.748
Only on Fox.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.290
D'oh!

00:25.292 --> 00:26.525
(tires screeching)

00:26.527 --> 00:28.227
(grunts)

00:30.130 --> 00:32.998
ANNOUNCER:
It's fourth and nine
for the Simpsons.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.467
Homer takes the snap,
looking for a receiver.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.535
They're all covered.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.804
He's gonna sneak it in!

00:38.806 --> 00:40.506
(crowd cheering)

00:40.508 --> 00:45.144
Oh, man, that is why
he gets to control the remote.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.212
♪

00:52.485 --> 00:53.652
(Simpsons eating)

00:53.654 --> 00:56.989
Mmm.
Oh, this tile is loose.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.491
I'll have to call a handy man.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.226
Why'd you say it like that?

01:01.228 --> 01:04.496
With a pause between the words.
Are you saying I'm not handy?

01:04.498 --> 01:07.499
That's how you
say it: handy man.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.068
It's handyman.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.704
That's what I said:
handy... man.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.006
(exclaims)
Marjorie,

01:14.008 --> 01:16.241
there is the profession:
handyman,

01:16.243 --> 01:17.843
and there are men who are handy.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.245
Which are you saying I'm not?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.680
Tell me.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.715
A handy...

01:23.717 --> 01:25.017
man.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.351
(exclaims)
Face it, homeboy,

01:26.353 --> 01:27.586
you ain't handy.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.388
Unless we need
a big fat paperweight.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.856
I'll paperweight you!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.357
Oh! (groaning)
(grunting)

01:32.359 --> 01:34.426
(grumbles)
Homie, sweetie,

01:34.428 --> 01:35.861
replacing a tile
is something

01:35.863 --> 01:38.097
you really need a
professional for.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.865
I know how to replace a tile.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.233
All guys do.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.235
We talk about it all the time.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.204
Grout?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.706
There's no stopping
what I've started here.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.109
Here's your tile.
Have fun.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.878
Handy... man.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.214
Lisa, honey, do you have any
idea how to replace a floor...?

01:55.216 --> 01:57.049
Here's a video tutorial
on replacing a tile.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.451
I don't know if I need a
whole tutorial to teach me...

01:59.453 --> 02:02.387
You're tapping.
You have to swipe.
I'm-I'm swiping, I'm swiping.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.889
Pretend you're swiping
chocolate icing off a cake.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.891
All right, how's that?
Ah, see? There.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.459
There it is, yeah. Perfect.
There really is
icing on here.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.794
All right, then.

02:10.230 --> 02:12.131
Hi there. If you're
watching this video,

02:12.133 --> 02:13.899
you've got a job
that needs doing

02:13.901 --> 02:15.801
but you're too cheap
to pay for it.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.470
Man, this guy's inside my head.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.572
Now, replacing a tile
is a simple task.

02:20.574 --> 02:24.309
As long as the substrate
beneath the tile isn't rotted.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.982
If there is rot
in your substrate,

02:29.984 --> 02:33.652
we will now play loud music
so you can curse.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.454
(salsa music playing,
Homer shouting)

02:35.456 --> 02:38.257
Stupid floor! Why...

02:38.259 --> 02:40.926
Why was I born a homeowner?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.127
On your marks.
On your marks.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.128
Get set.
Get set.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.630
Twins!
Twins!

02:44.632 --> 02:47.166
Loser!

02:47.168 --> 02:48.333
Oh, boy.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.835
(Ralph giggling)

02:49.837 --> 02:52.905
Oh. Why is everyone passing us?

02:54.274 --> 02:57.509
You know how scared I am
of going on a slant.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.011
Oh.
(grunts)

02:59.013 --> 03:00.112
Ow!

03:00.114 --> 03:02.181
Latchkey kids rule!

03:07.320 --> 03:08.787
I can't die now.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.455
I actually did my homework.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.757
(grunts)

03:17.630 --> 03:19.464
(groans)
I'm sorry, ma'am.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.999
Come spring, I'll go
get that for you.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.668
Dang good-for-nothin' cart.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.970
Always fighting to go left
when I wanted to go right.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.039
It was my only friend.
(crying)

03:33.846 --> 03:36.982
Now take your sponge,
wipe away the excess grout

03:36.984 --> 03:38.550
and you're done.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.853
Oh, my God,

03:41.855 --> 03:44.489
it looks like
what it's supposed to look like.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.525
I did man work!

03:46.527 --> 03:48.160
My hero.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.495
I'm happy to say I was wrong.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.998
I'll put Maggie down
and make you a snack.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.833
Something bacon-y.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.034
(whoops)

03:56.036 --> 03:58.170
A bacon apology sandwich.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.239
(meowing)

04:01.541 --> 04:02.874
What? No.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.276
No. No.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.179
(meow)
(scratching)

04:07.181 --> 04:08.847
Oh, I sealed in the cat.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.016
If it dies,
it'll stink up the whole house.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.684
Also, the kids like it.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.886
(meowing)

04:14.888 --> 04:16.521
Stupid genius cat.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.925
She went from under the floor
to inside the wall.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.727
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.228
MARGE:
More repairs?

04:23.230 --> 04:26.365
Aah! Marge, I should
tell you something.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.367
I knew it.
You're not a handy...

04:28.369 --> 04:30.369
No. You did not know it.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.372
I was going to say I'm not
stopping with the tile.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.207
Oh, no. Once
you've been bitten

04:35.209 --> 04:37.776
by the repair bug,
you can't quit.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.380
How would you like hot water
in the bathtub again?

04:41.382 --> 04:44.716
(gasps) I'll go get the "H" knob
out of my jewelry box.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.387
Mmm. Don't take long,
handy man.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.454
Handyman.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.423
(giggles)

04:51.425 --> 04:55.394
Okay, cat, I'll get you out
tomorrow, but here's dinner.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.930
Lasagna, which I know cats like.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.932
(door opens)
Oh!

05:00.934 --> 05:02.934
Nothing to see here.
Just kneeling

05:02.936 --> 05:04.603
in front of the
electric outlet,

05:04.605 --> 05:06.772
appreciating Edison's miracle.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.974
Look, Hettie, you
got two choices.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.575
Under the bed
or in the closet.

05:10.577 --> 05:13.078
I suppose I will take

05:13.080 --> 05:14.746
the closet.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.648
Oh, my goodness.
This is like my heyday

05:16.650 --> 05:18.583
when I was livin' in that car.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.652
You know, you get enough
parking tickets on the front,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.554
they act like curtains.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.124
(sniffs)
Mmm.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.126
Hey, mornin', boss.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.095
Hey, what you take
in your coffee?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.930
'Cause I got sugar
and I got something called

05:31.932 --> 05:34.599
"Not for individual sale."

05:34.601 --> 05:37.302
Listen. I don't think you should
get too comfortable here.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.471
Okay, okay.
Thought you might say that,

05:39.473 --> 05:42.808
but, uh, what if
I make it amenable to you?

05:42.810 --> 05:45.777
If you hide me here,
I'll give you a dollar a day.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.946
Here's one week in advance.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.615
Yes, I'm a slumlord.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.541
Then there was a freeway chase
on the news.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.076
Had to watch it till the end.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.412
The guy got arrested
in a cul-de-sac.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.680
They never do
what I yell at them to do.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.783
(meowing, scratching)

06:59.085 --> 07:01.153
Oh, you're in the ceiling?

07:03.923 --> 07:05.924
"Do not use top step"?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.226
Stupid government,
trying to keep us down.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.463

07:12.765 --> 07:14.833
Where is Bart
getting this money?

07:17.203 --> 07:18.537
(exclaims) Lisa?

07:18.539 --> 07:21.440
Just what do you
think you're up to?

07:21.442 --> 07:22.707
Mm...

07:22.709 --> 07:24.876
Come on. You can
tell Dr. Tuna.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.112
Okay, I admit it. I think
Bart's up to something funny,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.114
so I'm snooping in his room.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.616
No snooping. You know what
they say about curiosity.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.618
It killed the cat?
The cat's fine!

07:33.620 --> 07:36.955
Stop asking
about the cat!

07:36.957 --> 07:39.558
MAN: Lose a Kewpie doll

Hey, boss.
(clears throat)

07:44.631 --> 07:46.465
We have a situation here.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.900
You owe me three
weeks' back rent.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.302
Aha!

07:50.304 --> 07:52.304
Bart Simpson,
you are cruelly exploiting

07:52.306 --> 07:54.739
a poor,
unfortunate woman.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.076
So, you're gonna tell Mom
and she's gonna kick Hettie out.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.578
Girlie, ain't you got a heart?

07:59.580 --> 08:01.413
Nope. All brain,
no heart.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.783
Yeah. She looks like
a little bitty railroad bull.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.785
Now I got to sing for my supper.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.620

09:24.497 --> 09:25.697
If I know
my Smithsonian Folkways,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.399
that was
an Appalachian folk song.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.401
Well, I'm from
Lickskillet, Kentucky,

09:29.403 --> 09:31.336
just shy of the
Appalachia Trail.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.739
Really? Oh, I love, love, love
indigenous mountain music.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.576
(chuckles)
Well, isn't
that fascinatin'?

09:37.578 --> 09:40.512
I'm glad you
liked the song.

09:40.514 --> 09:43.248
Yes. I liked it
very, very, very m...

09:43.250 --> 09:45.417
Oh! You want money.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.919
I'm sorry. I don't have any.
(chuckles)

09:47.921 --> 09:50.355
I'm also a musician.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.058
(chuckles)
But you can stay in our house.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.727
Ha-ha! It's a deal!
Back in the boy's closet.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.228
No, Hettie.
You're a human being.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.364
You can sleep in <i>my</i> closet.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.199
Hmm. Well, la-di-da.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.567
How much you charge?

10:02.569 --> 10:05.203
Nothing. Maybe we can
talk a little music.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.739
Ugh. Boy, what's
your price again?

10:07.741 --> 10:10.241
Okay, we'll only talk about it
if you want to!

10:10.243 --> 10:11.543
But it would be an honor.

10:11.545 --> 10:12.744
Okay, let's go.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.212
Oh, you've hurt
yourself.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.747
Uh, nope, that's syrup.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.382
Oh, let me find you
a Wet-Nap.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.084
I just woke up
from a wet nap.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.119
Okay.
Conversation's over.

10:21.121 --> 10:21.953
LISA: <i>Check, one, two.</i>

10:21.955 --> 10:23.755
All right... No, no, no,

10:23.757 --> 10:25.390
leave the windows open.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.392
I like crickets and
night breeze in my music.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.061
They do go well together.
Have you always been musical?

10:30.063 --> 10:33.064
You know, first sound I ever
heard was my daddy fiddlin'.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.600
His name was Bascom Lee Boggs.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.402
(gasps)
Bascom Lee Boggs?!

10:37.404 --> 10:39.904
He played with
some seminal Appalachian bands,

10:39.906 --> 10:41.740
like Snug
and the Cousin Huggers,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.775
Lead Paint Larry
and the Drooly Boys,

10:43.777 --> 10:46.244
Howlin' Sue
and Her Vestigial Organ,

10:46.246 --> 10:48.413
and Bloody Mary
and the Coalmine Canaries.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.583
(inhales) Did your daddy
teach you to fiddle?
No.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.785
He was gonna start me out
on the cigar box "banjer,"

10:53.787 --> 10:56.921
but, uh, 'fore he could,
he-he lost his sight.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.423
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.625
Yeah, he got shot
in the face.

11:00.627 --> 11:03.428
(gasps)
You know them puzzles
where you slide the tiles?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.130
He looks a little
like that now.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.966
My mother was an amazing
"banjer" player. Mmm.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.603
Unfortunately, she
did also go blind.
Really?

11:11.605 --> 11:14.005
Yeah, it was winter
and she was runnin' a fever

11:14.007 --> 11:16.775
and, um, then she got shot
in the face.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.011
Oh, wow. Hettie,
you've had such a sad life.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.280
But you know what?
That's gonna turn around

11:22.282 --> 11:24.783
when I show the world
what it's missing in you.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.452
Well, I don't know if
the world's gonna get me,

11:27.454 --> 11:30.288
but, child, it sure feels
good to know that you do.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.690
Mmm.
Mmm.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.024
You're having a moment
with someone

11:33.026 --> 11:34.793
who has so few moments.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.828
This will never be forgotten.

11:36.830 --> 11:41.499
Oh, baby girl, I feel like I'm
back home in poorest Appalachia.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.168
Thank you.

11:43.170 --> 11:47.172

I've-I've truly come
to hate music.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.543
That is so sad.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.012
I wanted to arrange a concert
in Springfield Park.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.749
We needed the school's lights
and sound system.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.352
Lights? Sweetie, you don't know
a Fresnel from a gobo.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.721
Well, I think you'll help me
every way you can.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.389
And why, pray tell, is that?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.859
Because deep down, there's
still a part of you

12:40.861 --> 12:43.394
that remembers music
can be magical.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.063
(chuckles)
You're right.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.198
I can't bear
to kill your passion.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.534
It will live at least
until third grade,

12:49.536 --> 12:52.070
when you get Mrs. Ortner.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.372
So, I got back together
with Jeff.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.375
Then, of course, I realized
there was a reason we broke up.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.910
(playing tuba)

12:58.912 --> 13:02.046
That sounds awful,
and you look stupid doing it.

Hettie, Hettie, I have
a surprise for you!

13:24.938 --> 13:28.106
(gasps) Oh, well,
barbecue my bedbugs.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.108
That is glorious.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.411
(chuckles) To pay for it,
I sold my Malibu Stacys.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.948
Which, from a feminist
perspective, was long overdue.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.451
But I have a Ken that I'm
transitioning to a Stacy.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.920
Try it on, try it on,
try it on!

13:41.922 --> 13:44.055
I heard you the second time!

13:45.424 --> 13:47.625
Mmm, mmm. Why,
thank you, Your Majesty,

13:47.627 --> 13:49.594
I will have
another cup of soda.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.996
Lise, Lise, Lise.
(grunting) What?!

13:51.998 --> 13:54.432
I've seen you like this
before, and it ends badly.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.100
She is gonna
break your heart.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.102
And your heart's as
tough as a soap bubble.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.271

over that dead plant?

Oh. It's the seven-month
anniversary of that.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.776

14:04.778 --> 14:06.444
Oh, geez, here
we go again.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.847
Ugh. You know what, Bart?
Just get out!

14:08.849 --> 14:11.282
And get Dad's keys and
drive us to the radio station.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.284
And then get out!
Wait until we're done.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.454
Then drive us back.
Then get out!

Uh, uh,
I'll do it!
Oh.

You idiot. Now we'll always
have to do the laundry!

14:31.805 --> 14:33.471
(laughs)

14:33.473 --> 14:35.807
I'll do it wrong
so she'll never ask again.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.976
Homer, you're a genius!

14:37.978 --> 14:39.677
Thanks, brain!

14:39.679 --> 14:41.946
Oh, I'm not your brain.
I'm a blood clot.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.050
Okay. I'm goin' in.

that insulation.

Whoo-hoo!

14:56.196 --> 14:58.997

Yes, she is.

why you didn't perform with your
older brothers and sisters?

15:56.423 --> 15:58.222
I mean, they would ask
me to. They would...

15:58.224 --> 15:59.724
They'd say,
"Hettie, come over here,

15:59.726 --> 16:01.960
pick up a banjo
and play a song with us."

16:01.962 --> 16:03.728
