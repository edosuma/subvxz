WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:03.477
â™ª

00:03.480 --> 00:05.062
Wait! Hold the elevator.

00:05.064 --> 00:06.564
What's that?

00:06.566 --> 00:08.199
- This old thing?
- Mmm.

00:08.201 --> 00:09.984
Just a little tennis trophy
I won last night.

00:09.986 --> 00:11.352
"Women's B-League
Champion...

00:11.354 --> 00:12.603
50 and Older
Division"?

00:12.605 --> 00:14.238
- Must be a typo.
- Ah.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.241
Uh, I realize I might be wading
into shrew-infested waters,

00:17.243 --> 00:19.110
but you are under 50,
aren't you?

00:19.112 --> 00:20.778
Hey, no.
She's over 50.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.196
You think Sydney would
lie about her age

00:22.198 --> 00:24.615
just to win a tournament
against weaker competition?

00:24.617 --> 00:25.649
- I hate you both.
- Mm-hmm.

00:25.651 --> 00:28.002
- Say, isn't it illegal...
- Not if they don't check.

00:28.004 --> 00:29.153
And when you think about it,

00:29.155 --> 00:31.289
these people have been playing
for decades longer than I have,

00:31.291 --> 00:33.374
so technically, this
victory means more...

00:33.376 --> 00:34.625
I just wanted to win.

00:34.627 --> 00:36.160
- There you go.
- We just wanted confirmation.

00:36.162 --> 00:38.796
Now that we've untangled
Sydney's web of lies,

00:38.798 --> 00:41.048
get me up to speed on
the video game pitch.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.967
Well, we've been playing
last year's <i>Medal of Glory,</i>

00:42.969 --> 00:44.452
and since I
consistently beat Andrew...

00:44.454 --> 00:46.053
If by "consistently"
you mean "almost never."

00:46.055 --> 00:47.638
...I'll tell you,
we think a great theme

00:47.640 --> 00:49.340
for the upcoming game
should be "enlistment."

00:49.342 --> 00:50.942
Ah. Who doesn't
like to enlist?

00:50.944 --> 00:52.188
Makes you feel like
you're part of something.

00:52.189 --> 00:53.861
Totally. It's all a
recruitment campaign.

00:53.863 --> 00:55.062
We're gonna have posters,
people in malls...

00:55.064 --> 00:56.814
we'll rent out
storefronts

00:56.816 --> 00:58.983
and literally enlist guys
to play the game.

00:58.985 --> 00:59.967
I see.

00:59.969 --> 01:01.118
All the excitement of combat

01:01.120 --> 01:02.403
from the comfort of
your mother's couch.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.405
Oh... mmm.
It's not bad.

01:04.407 --> 01:05.840
Okay, Sydney, where are you at

01:05.842 --> 01:07.408
with the Zen-Phoria Spa
campaign? Dazzle me.

01:07.410 --> 01:09.294
Uh, I've asked Lauren
to assist me on this one.

01:09.296 --> 01:11.045
She has first-hand
experience.

01:11.047 --> 01:12.363
Yeah, I went to
the Florida Panhandle

01:12.365 --> 01:13.831
School of Cosmetology,
Class of February.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.583
- Good month.
- We want to communicate

01:15.585 --> 01:17.860
to the customer that
Zen-Phoria is more

01:17.861 --> 01:20.137
than just a spa,
it's an experience.

01:20.139 --> 01:21.556
It's a lifestyle.

01:21.558 --> 01:23.507
Something you can take
with you wherever you go.

01:23.509 --> 01:26.010
B.Y.O.Z.

01:26.012 --> 01:27.845
Bring your own Zen.

01:27.847 --> 01:30.014
Great ideas. Mach
military game campaign;

01:30.016 --> 01:32.516
thoughtful, sensitive
spa stuff.

01:32.518 --> 01:33.985
This is exactly what
the clients are expecting.

01:33.987 --> 01:34.769
- Thank you.
- Great.

01:34.770 --> 01:35.552
- Fantastic.
- Great.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.054
Which is exactly why
we're not gonna do them.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.239
Okay.
Saw that coming.

01:38.241 --> 01:39.523
Inspiration hit me
this morning

01:39.525 --> 01:41.692
about 3:00 in the morning,
not like the old days.

01:41.694 --> 01:43.244
I had just installed this new
app on my smart telephone...

01:43.246 --> 01:45.529
- Also known as a phone.
- It's called Roadz, with a "Z."

01:45.531 --> 01:46.747
The "Z" makes it kicky.
It tells you

01:46.749 --> 01:48.866
how to avoid traffic.
It also takes you

01:48.868 --> 01:50.668
to areas of the city
you never knew existed.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.404
For example, did you know
Chicago also has a South Side?

01:53.406 --> 01:54.589
Well, now I do.

01:54.591 --> 01:56.090
This is what we need
to do with our campaigns.

01:56.092 --> 01:58.175
You know?
Get outside our comfort zones.

01:58.177 --> 02:00.211
Take the clients
on an adventure!

02:00.559 --> 02:01.963
So what are you saying?

02:01.965 --> 02:04.632
Lads on lotion,
gals on guns. Go!

02:04.634 --> 02:06.133
Come on, put your hands
in there, yeah...

02:06.135 --> 02:07.885
Simon, you did it again.
That's a great idea.

02:07.887 --> 02:09.586
He did it again.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.689
This happens every time
he downloads a new app.

02:11.691 --> 02:13.391
He comes up with
some brilliant idea

02:13.393 --> 02:14.925
that just makes
our lives way harder.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.644
Yeah, we just got
this place cleaned up

02:16.646 --> 02:18.312
from the Fruit Ninja incident.

02:18.314 --> 02:19.947
Hai!

02:19.949 --> 02:21.148
Payaya!

02:22.884 --> 02:24.652
Ah! Hai-yah!

02:24.654 --> 02:26.287
Maybe that's why we have ants.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.656
Who gave him the password
to his iTunes account, anyway?

02:28.658 --> 02:30.708
I mean, those parental controls
are there for a reason.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.243
He said he was just
downloading books.

02:32.245 --> 02:33.461
He's never just
downloading books.

02:33.463 --> 02:35.379
Now we have to write
about spa crap.

02:35.381 --> 02:37.465
Do you know what it's like
growing up one of seven sisters?

02:37.467 --> 02:39.950
- Don't say it like that.
- I spent my entire childhood

02:39.952 --> 02:41.719
evading people trying
to put makeup on me.

02:41.721 --> 02:44.088
Then I'd have to go to school
in eyeliner and blush.

02:44.090 --> 02:46.557
And then I'd get a black eye.
Then I'd have to put

02:46.559 --> 02:49.226
makeup on it, and the cycle
of violence would continue.

02:49.228 --> 02:51.362
- I want none of it.
- Well, neither do I.

02:51.364 --> 02:52.813
It's gonna ruin women for me.

02:52.815 --> 02:54.432
The makeup, the lotion,
the perfume...

02:54.434 --> 02:56.817
Once you pull back the curtain,
you see things you can't unsee.

02:56.819 --> 02:58.469
I don't want to know
how the sausage is made.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.970
Yeah, well, the good
news for you is

02:59.972 --> 03:01.489
you can't compete
over spa products.

03:01.491 --> 03:02.639
Well, I bet you're
thrilled about that,

03:02.641 --> 03:04.075
because you wouldn't
stand a chance,

03:04.077 --> 03:05.493
being that your crow's feet
make you more bird than man.

03:05.495 --> 03:06.911
Oh, I'm sorry,

03:06.913 --> 03:08.329
I couldn't hear you
over those sunspots

03:08.331 --> 03:09.914
you've been passing
off as freckles.

03:09.916 --> 03:11.248
Boys, you're both lovely,

03:11.250 --> 03:13.000
and I'm sure any man would
be very lucky to have you.

03:13.002 --> 03:14.335
- Thank you.
- What about me?

03:14.337 --> 03:16.037
I have to write
about video games.

03:17.457 --> 03:18.673
Well, if an 11-year-old
can play them,

03:18.675 --> 03:19.924
I guess I can talk
about them, right?

03:19.926 --> 03:20.958
You know they're dropping off

03:20.960 --> 03:22.343
advance copies of
the game in an hour.

03:22.345 --> 03:24.045
- Super secret copies?
- No one's even played it.

03:31.770 --> 03:33.187
I can't say for sure

03:33.189 --> 03:34.889
they don't get laid,
but this does not bode well.

03:34.891 --> 03:37.441
There are only 100 of
these on planet Earth.

03:37.443 --> 03:38.976
Oh, it's beautiful!

03:38.978 --> 03:40.478
- It's here!
- Oh, my God, it's amazing.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.696
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.269
Please forgive
my associates.

03:44.288 --> 03:45.780
It's very exciting.
Tell us more.

03:45.786 --> 03:46.877
Well, the main difference

03:46.977 --> 03:48.820
between this game and the last
one is that in this game,

03:48.822 --> 03:50.404
you can upload
a photo of yourself

03:50.406 --> 03:52.895
and play as an avatar that
looks exactly like you.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.691
Which is, uh,
unfortunate for Jerome.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.993
Yeah. What?
No, shut up.

03:55.995 --> 03:57.661
I got this.
I-I read the manual.

03:58.831 --> 04:01.332
Customizable avatars seem
like a great improvement.

04:01.334 --> 04:03.567
But I really hope
you left the, uh,

04:03.569 --> 04:05.219
rocket launcher locked
to the left trigger button,

04:05.221 --> 04:06.537
because I love that.

04:06.539 --> 04:09.306
Yeah. I mean, it's not,
uh, the most powerful weapon

04:09.308 --> 04:10.808
but who doesn't love
rocket-jumping?

04:10.810 --> 04:13.477
Oh! Don't get me started
on rocket-jumping.

04:13.479 --> 04:15.846
What map do you, uh,
rocket-jump on the most?

04:15.848 --> 04:18.599
I haven't been
rocket-jumping as much

04:18.601 --> 04:20.401
since I was an N-zero-zero-B.

04:21.603 --> 04:22.770
Are you...

04:22.772 --> 04:24.572
are you trying
to say "noob"?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.858
Tomato, to-mah-to.
I mean, you know...

04:27.860 --> 04:30.861
I rocket-jump in
Baghdad all the time.

04:30.863 --> 04:32.163
It's the only way to get to
the top of the Imperial Palace.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.831
You find the
Easter Egg up there?

04:33.833 --> 04:34.949
Found it? Uh...

04:34.951 --> 04:36.450
how do you think we
unlocked the bunny level?

04:36.452 --> 04:38.285
Bunny level!
Bunny level!

04:38.287 --> 04:41.589
Boom! Goes the bunny
'cause the bunny goes boom!

04:45.243 --> 04:51.094

The Crazy Ones
1.12 - The Face of a Winner

05:00.443 --> 05:01.542
Oh, my God.

05:01.544 --> 05:03.477
This is ridiculous.
I-I had

05:03.479 --> 05:05.412
a winning pitch for the
Zen-Phoria campaign.

05:05.414 --> 05:06.614
There's no way
I'm gonna be able

05:06.616 --> 05:08.232
to break into this
video game boys' club.

05:08.234 --> 05:09.717
Are you kidding?

05:09.719 --> 05:11.652
Those guys would do anything
to get next to a human woman.

05:11.654 --> 05:13.770
Your idea was good,
but a winning idea

05:13.772 --> 05:15.573
comes from looking at something
from a new perspective.

05:15.575 --> 05:17.158
I fear an analogy
coming on.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.775
Maybe you're wrong.
Maybe it's a simile.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.294
You're right, it's an analogy.

05:20.296 --> 05:21.612
A sculpture

05:21.614 --> 05:23.547
tells a different story when
viewed from another angle.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.554
<i>Rodin's The Thinker,</i>
for example,

05:25.602 --> 05:27.718
when viewed from the front,
he's contemplating life.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.220
When viewed from the back,
it's a guy on a toilet.

05:29.222 --> 05:30.504
He could still be thinking.

05:30.506 --> 05:33.190
See? It's working already.
You'll find your winning idea.

05:33.192 --> 05:34.958
All you have to do is fall
in love with the product

05:34.960 --> 05:35.926
from a new perspective.

05:35.928 --> 05:37.511
But how am I supposed
to fall in love

05:37.513 --> 05:38.762
with that stupid game?

05:38.764 --> 05:41.849
- I don't even play video games.
- If only there was a solution.

05:44.654 --> 05:46.971
We used the picture
from your company ID.

05:47.907 --> 05:49.073
Oh, great.

05:49.075 --> 05:51.525
I was worried you wouldn't be able
to find a terrible picture of me.

05:51.527 --> 05:56.163
Don't worry, Syd. No one's
going to be looking at your face.

05:56.165 --> 05:57.615
So here where
you can make changes

05:57.617 --> 05:58.666
to your body, you know,

05:58.668 --> 06:00.201
anything that you
might want to augment...

06:00.203 --> 06:02.986
Yeah, I think I'll take a more
athletic body type, thank you.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.672
Oh, what about the
women's 50 and over

06:04.674 --> 06:06.957
tennis champion look?

06:06.959 --> 06:09.043
I hate this game and
we haven't even started.

06:09.045 --> 06:11.295
Okay, I'm top right.
Andrew, you're top left.

06:11.297 --> 06:12.596
Syd, you're bottom left.

06:12.598 --> 06:14.548
Lauren, you are the hot
one in the corner.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.799
On your six!

06:17.836 --> 06:18.853
It just vibrated.
What does that mean?

06:18.855 --> 06:20.437
I just shot you.
Wh...?

06:20.439 --> 06:22.223
Why would you do that?
Stupid game.

06:22.225 --> 06:23.974
It's very accurate.

06:23.976 --> 06:25.392
This is what
life would be like

06:25.394 --> 06:27.844
in a contemporary
military engagement.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.281
Look, there's a life pellet.
Walk on it, absorb it.

06:32.034 --> 06:33.517
Hey, Lauren,
you just shot me.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.535
No, it wasn't me.

06:34.537 --> 06:35.686
It wasn't me, either.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.204
How many buttons does
this damn thing have?

06:38.374 --> 06:39.356
Who just shot me?

06:39.358 --> 06:41.825
Think it was
Andre Sagassi over there.

06:41.827 --> 06:43.294
Me? Well...

06:43.296 --> 06:45.079
maybe this game isn't
so bad after all.

06:45.081 --> 06:46.714
She's tasted
first blood, boys.

06:46.716 --> 06:47.798
You two better
watch out.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.718
You watch out.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.919
Don't you make
eyeballs at me, maggot.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.137
Watch out!

06:53.139 --> 06:54.838
I mean...

06:54.840 --> 06:56.757
video game's fun!
Yay!

Wow, your skin
looks amazing.

07:08.232 --> 07:09.798
Not a pore on there.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.350
I-I'm using
the Zen-Phoria

07:11.352 --> 07:13.002
Practice Makes
Pore-fect regimen.

07:13.004 --> 07:14.169
Here, smell that.
It's peppermint.

07:16.207 --> 07:18.011
It's like a faceful
of Christmas.

07:21.062 --> 07:22.862
- You're a show-off.
- What?

07:22.864 --> 07:25.514
Simon told us to use the
products to inspire a pitch.

07:25.516 --> 07:27.182
Like this one
I just came up with:

07:27.184 --> 07:28.734
"Zen-Phoria:
Are you elevator ready?"

07:28.736 --> 07:29.851
And if I may
answer for you...

07:29.853 --> 07:31.620
- no.
- You know what?

07:31.622 --> 07:33.539
That peppermint smell
is making it hard to hate you,

07:33.541 --> 07:35.291
but I'm going
to take you down.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.359
Oh, Sydney came in early.

07:37.361 --> 07:39.562
I think she's wearing the
same clothes as yesterday.

07:39.564 --> 07:40.746
That's definitely
yesterday's

07:40.748 --> 07:41.714
last season's blouse.

07:41.716 --> 07:42.715
Oh, hey, guys.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.750
I'm just playing with some
friends I met in closed beta.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.001
Die, Joey!

07:46.003 --> 07:47.887
You're not gonna make it to 11.
I'm winning!

07:49.039 --> 07:50.923
- I should probably talk to her.
- Yeah.

07:50.925 --> 07:52.474
Andrew... let me
smell you for good luck.

07:53.811 --> 07:55.811
That is so good.

07:55.813 --> 07:57.429
Dad time.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.982
Sweetie, have you
been here all night?

07:59.984 --> 08:01.049
Yeah.

08:01.051 --> 08:02.568
You told me to get
out of my comfort zone.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.219
Well, my back's killing me,
I've had to pee since midnight,

08:04.221 --> 08:05.321
so mission accomplished!

08:05.323 --> 08:07.568
You know, the Zen-Phoria
people are almost here.

08:08.564 --> 08:09.241
Yeah.

08:09.243 --> 08:10.743
Quick comb through my face,
and I'll pop in.

08:12.914 --> 08:14.496
- Sweetie?
- Uh-huh?

08:14.498 --> 08:17.616
You may want to put your, uh,
"lady's helper" back on.

08:19.069 --> 08:20.085
Yeah.

08:20.087 --> 08:22.838
Seriously, quick coat
of paint and I'll be...

08:22.840 --> 08:24.590
Ooh... Door.

08:24.592 --> 08:25.907
Okay. Don't worry.

08:31.548 --> 08:32.798
Is she okay?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
Who among us hasn't
needed a little disco nap

08:34.802 --> 08:36.018
to get through the day?

08:36.020 --> 08:36.969
You know what?

08:36.971 --> 08:38.919
Dim the lights,
put on some Enya.

08:38.922 --> 08:40.773
The Zen-Phoria people
will think she's meditating.

08:40.775 --> 08:42.140
I'll put a mask on her, too,

08:42.143 --> 08:43.275
so they think
she's moisturizing.

08:43.277 --> 08:44.926
- Ooh.
- Cosmetology school.

08:44.928 --> 08:46.862
We're coming up on
our 46-month reunion.

08:46.864 --> 08:48.956
- It's at the Ramada.
- Go February.

08:55.105 --> 08:56.905
Oh, hello!

08:56.907 --> 08:58.958
Welcome to Lewis,
Roberts & Roberts.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.075
You've caught us during

09:00.077 --> 09:02.611
one of our mandatory
spa-lax days.

09:02.613 --> 09:04.296
We like to say
the campaign to happiness

09:04.298 --> 09:07.633
starts with your chi
and extends outward.

09:07.635 --> 09:09.468
Oh, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

09:09.470 --> 09:11.136
I was just
pampering myself

09:11.138 --> 09:13.422
with a Zen-Phoria
Sleeping Beauty Glo-mask.

09:13.424 --> 09:15.057
Actually, I'm also
wearing that mask,

09:15.059 --> 09:16.458
except I've
combined mine

09:16.460 --> 09:18.293
with a Scrub You Later
oxygenation mask

09:18.295 --> 09:19.845
for complete relaxation.

09:19.847 --> 09:21.630
I think, chemically,

09:21.632 --> 09:23.399
you're not supposed
to combine those.

09:23.401 --> 09:25.634
Oh, really?
I feel fine.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.654
Like a faceful of hot snakes.

09:28.656 --> 09:31.073
Well, you know, you can't sell it
if you don't live it, folks.

09:31.075 --> 09:34.276
Now, we believe that creativity
springs from serenity,

09:34.278 --> 09:35.611
a sense of calm...

09:35.613 --> 09:37.913
I just unlocked
Kosovo, bitches!

09:37.915 --> 09:41.333
Oh, Serbia, you're about
to go boo-yah-ka-shah!

09:41.335 --> 09:42.668
We do a lot of work

09:42.670 --> 09:44.036
with Eastern European
war veterans, and...

09:44.038 --> 09:45.487
Will you excuse me?

09:45.489 --> 09:47.840
I have to go conduct
an aura adjustment.

09:47.842 --> 09:50.009
Zachary, will you
finish the tour?

09:50.011 --> 09:51.993
Namaste.

09:51.995 --> 09:52.961
I'd love to.

09:52.963 --> 09:54.847
Because I am filled
with Zen-Phoria.

09:54.849 --> 09:57.466
I also am filled
with Zen-Phor...

10:00.569 --> 10:02.805
Oh, you run, but you
cannot hide!

10:02.807 --> 10:04.976
- There's no hiding!
- Hey, Private Ryan.

10:05.011 --> 10:06.017
Pause the game.

10:08.362 --> 10:09.978
You know you almost ruined
the Zen-Phoria pitch?

10:09.980 --> 10:11.313
Multi-million dollar contract,

10:11.315 --> 10:13.014
not to mention
tons of free swag.

10:13.016 --> 10:14.483
Sorry, I just got
really excited.

10:14.485 --> 10:15.534
I know you did.
In my defense,

10:15.536 --> 10:17.236
I had just unlocked
chemical weapons.

10:17.238 --> 10:19.187
I am kicking ass at this.
I am winning!

10:19.189 --> 10:21.356
Honey, you have to be careful
you don't get too obsessed.

10:21.358 --> 10:23.459
I was just trying to fall
in love with the product

10:23.461 --> 10:25.527
- like you told me, but...
- I know.

10:25.529 --> 10:28.954
I guess I was wrong. I mean,
I'm not doing what you want.

10:28.989 --> 10:30.255
I don't know what
you want me to do!

10:30.290 --> 10:31.542
I'm really trying!

10:31.577 --> 10:32.501
Oh, no, honey.
I know you're trying.

10:32.503 --> 10:34.369
I know you are, okay?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

10:34.371 --> 10:37.473
- I'm just, I'm really tired.
- I know you are.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.374
You know, and you
keep yelling at me!

10:39.376 --> 10:40.542
I'm not yelling at you.
I'm not yelling.

10:40.544 --> 10:42.094
- Yell at me...
- I'm sorry.

10:42.096 --> 10:43.718
Please, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me, okay?

10:43.719 --> 10:45.119
Okay.

10:45.266 --> 10:46.982
Maybe the research phase
of this project's over,

10:46.984 --> 10:48.650
okay, baby?
Maybe we'll get Lauren in here

10:48.652 --> 10:50.486
and you guys can start throwing
some ideas around, huh?

10:50.488 --> 10:51.737
How about that, huh?

10:51.739 --> 10:53.355
- Okay.
- All right, listen to me.

10:53.357 --> 10:55.407
You can take as much time
as you want.

10:55.409 --> 10:58.026
- You're very pretty.
- Oh, you, too.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.395
Okay.

11:00.397 --> 11:02.498
Okay, have fun.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.617
What just happened?

11:08.249 --> 11:09.833
Andrew, I have to say,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.151
those facial burns really
highlight your cheekbones.

11:12.153 --> 11:13.403
Enjoy them while they last.

11:13.405 --> 11:14.971
They're going away
thanks to Zen-Phoria's

11:14.973 --> 11:16.573
Aloe Ladies cooling mask.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.000
So, boss, we have
something that

11:18.001 --> 11:19.426
we really need to
talk to you about.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.012
- It sounds serious.
- Well, I'm afraid it is.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.047
Whose hands do you
think are softer?

11:24.049 --> 11:27.000
Oh, I knew this day would come.
I'll have to do the touch test.

11:27.002 --> 11:28.018
Thank you.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.637
This is so hard. I look at Zach,
and I think of clouds.

11:30.639 --> 11:32.355
Then I transfer the softness
to his hands.

11:32.357 --> 11:33.974
You know what?
I'm gonna put on the

11:33.976 --> 11:35.108
Zen-Phoria
sexy kitty sleep mask.

11:35.110 --> 11:36.359
That way, I can be objective.

11:36.361 --> 11:39.012
You guys move around and then
gently caress my cheeks.

11:39.014 --> 11:41.815
I think that way I won't be able
to have a favorite.

11:41.817 --> 11:44.451
Mm-hmm. That's good,
that's good.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.368
Simon, I need you...

11:45.370 --> 11:48.855
Damn it woman! Can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?!

11:48.857 --> 11:51.074
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner!

11:51.076 --> 11:53.243
In your over-exfoliated face.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.579
Oh, jokes on you.
I burn my face off.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.130
Now what's so important,
Lauren?

11:57.132 --> 11:59.165
Well, you wanted to see where
Sydney and I were on

11:59.167 --> 12:00.366
the Medal of Glory account?

12:00.368 --> 12:01.585
Yes. My hands are dry.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.870
Hit me with some of that
sexy magic there, would you?

12:03.872 --> 12:04.921
Give me some, too.

12:04.923 --> 12:06.840
I have to admit,
your hands are softer.

12:06.842 --> 12:08.058
- That's good.
- Thanks very much.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.843
Okay, so where
are you guys at?

12:09.845 --> 12:11.878
Well, um, Sydney said
it was important

12:11.880 --> 12:13.546
to fall in love
with the product.

12:13.548 --> 12:15.548
- It is. So did you?
- No, I hate it.

12:15.550 --> 12:19.052
Sydney's so mean! She keeps
camping my spawn point.

12:19.054 --> 12:21.605
Every time I come back alive,
she kills me!

12:22.824 --> 12:25.442
Ten points. Ten points.
Ten points. Ten points.

12:25.444 --> 12:27.410
That's terrible!
I raised her better than that.

12:27.412 --> 12:29.279
That wasn't even
the worst of it.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.397
I'm winning,
I'm winning.

12:31.399 --> 12:34.233
I'm really, really winning.
Oh, I'm winning.

12:34.235 --> 12:37.070
I'm winning,
I'm really, really winning.

12:37.072 --> 12:39.372
Oh! Hello, loser's hotline.

12:39.374 --> 12:40.790
It's for you.

12:40.792 --> 12:43.376
I raised a bad winner
and a worse dancer.

12:43.378 --> 12:44.961
Then it got really ugly.

12:44.963 --> 12:47.430
You frag me one more
time in Team Death Match,

12:47.432 --> 12:51.017
and... You know what?
Too late.

12:56.758 --> 12:58.725
Well, that's how it felt.

12:58.727 --> 13:00.226
You know,
it's all Sydney's fault!

13:00.228 --> 13:02.312
I have to take
a smidgen of blame.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.097
Possibly, I put
too much pressure on her.

13:04.099 --> 13:06.933
- That's what she said to me.
- Classic addict deflection.

13:06.935 --> 13:10.269
Wow, you're right.
That was always my best move.

13:10.271 --> 13:12.789
Tell me about it.
My mom was an addict

13:12.791 --> 13:14.791
for most of my childhood.
Wasn't pretty.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.990
- I'm so sorry. I never knew.
- Nah, it was terrible.

13:17.025 --> 13:19.913
It's, like, holidays ruined,
obsessive behavior.

13:19.915 --> 13:22.465
It felt like she'd do
anything for a Whatchamacallit.

13:22.467 --> 13:23.383
A fix.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.635
No, um, a Whatchamacallit.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.621
Similar to a Crunch bar,
but made by Hershey's.

13:28.623 --> 13:29.956
Mom was a chocaholic.

13:31.035 --> 13:34.427
- That sounds terrible.
- Yeah, it was.

13:34.429 --> 13:36.229
Never knowing if you're gonna
get an Easter

13:36.231 --> 13:37.931
'cause Mom's on a bender.

13:37.933 --> 13:40.684
Her telling us the Easter Bunny
had skipped our house that day,

13:40.686 --> 13:42.936
but we knew he'd been there.

13:42.938 --> 13:44.470
Mom had just kept everything
for herself.

13:44.472 --> 13:46.906
You know there's
no Easter Bunny, right?

13:46.908 --> 13:48.074
Not for us, there wasn't.

13:48.076 --> 13:49.326
Seems too fast
to be an addiction.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.162
Sydney always was
an overachiever.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.980
I'm gonna go talk to her.

13:55.349 --> 13:57.083
Damn this sweet cocoa butter.

13:57.085 --> 13:59.336
I can help you with that.
I got it, I got it.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.705
- Get out of the way.
- It's greasy.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.231
- Let me try again.
- Let me grab it.

14:04.266 --> 14:06.343
- No, I got it.
- I think it's locked.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.461
Come on.

14:08.463 --> 14:10.096
- Guys.
- Damn it, woman!

14:10.098 --> 14:12.215
Can't you see 're trying
to open a door here?

14:12.217 --> 14:13.850
Sydney's leaving.
What?

14:16.554 --> 14:17.520
Syd! Sydney!

14:17.522 --> 14:20.473
Hey, Sydney,
where you going, honey?

14:20.475 --> 14:22.275
Oh, I'm gonna grab
an early lunch.

14:22.277 --> 14:24.510
Ah. I mean, the bandwidth
here sucks.

14:24.512 --> 14:26.980
Who has three hours to wait
for the Lebanon DLZ?

14:26.982 --> 14:28.398
Why is this place so stupid?!

14:28.400 --> 14:31.151
Maybe we need to stage
an intervention.

14:31.153 --> 14:33.787
I'm not sure that would help.
I tried talking to her,

14:33.789 --> 14:36.189
and she used some sort
of Jedi mind trick on me.

14:36.191 --> 14:38.324
I don't think a traditional
intervention's the way to go.

14:38.326 --> 14:40.043
Maybe we don't
go traditional.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.050
What the hell's going on?

14:47.052 --> 14:48.952
Did I just wander
into a multiplayer game?

14:48.954 --> 14:50.520
We're here because
we care about you, pumpkin.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.639
Because you've been
acting like a psychopath.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.008
- Lauren, that wasn't nice.
- Even when my voice goes up?

14:55.010 --> 14:57.210
"Your addiction
has brought back

14:57.212 --> 15:00.046
"painful memories of
my mother, waking up

15:00.048 --> 15:01.898
"to a kitchen full of
chocolate cordial wrappers.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.933
It's no way
to start the day".

15:03.935 --> 15:05.151
Rum chocolates?

15:05.153 --> 15:07.270
Are you sure your mother
wasn't just a fat alcoholic?

15:07.272 --> 15:08.488
This isn't
about my mother.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.074
- Are you wearing guyliner?
- The real question is,

15:11.076 --> 15:13.109
are my eyes popping more
than your eyes? Yes.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.694
Psst! Focus.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.112
Honey, since you've
started playing,

15:16.114 --> 15:17.447
you ruined
the Zen-Phoria pitch,

15:17.449 --> 15:18.731
you've attacked
people who loved you,

15:18.733 --> 15:20.667
and you let your personal
grooming go to hell.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.585
But we love you
and we're here for you.

15:22.587 --> 15:25.004
We just want you to know
this is a safe place.

15:25.006 --> 15:28.675
Thank you. I hear you.

15:29.694 --> 15:31.662
I just want to say one thing.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.380
Intervention over, bitches!

15:41.544 --> 15:44.057
Can't say I didn't
see that coming.

15:44.059 --> 15:46.025
That's how my first
intervention ended.

15:54.822 --> 15:56.605
Hello, Sydney.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.741
- Dad?
- Ah.

15:58.743 --> 16:01.591
How did you find me?
Oh, your Find-A-Friend app.

16:01.626 --> 16:03.563
Yeah. Would have been here
sooner, except the Roadz app

16:03.565 --> 16:05.081
tried to send me through
Lake Michigan.

16:05.083 --> 16:09.002
I think she's trying to kill me.
Hey, sweetie,

16:09.004 --> 16:12.455
I need to talk to you about
this addiction of yours.

16:12.457 --> 16:14.924
Oh, God, why are you guys making
such a big deal out of this?

16:14.926 --> 16:16.225
I enjoy playing a video game.

16:16.227 --> 16:18.094
I mean, Desmond, you enjoy
playing video games, right?

16:18.096 --> 16:19.145
I mean, you're not addicted.

16:19.147 --> 16:20.296
I've been here
since Wednesday.

16:20.298 --> 16:21.681
My wife's having
a baby right now.

16:21.683 --> 16:22.732
See? Desmond's fine.

16:22.734 --> 16:24.183
I guess this shouldn't
come as a shock

16:24.185 --> 16:26.135
that you have addictive behavior.
You are my daughter.

16:26.137 --> 16:27.937
I'm not addicted
to a video game.

16:27.939 --> 16:31.791
No, honey, I think you're
addicted to winning.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.993
Wow, this is all my fault.

16:33.995 --> 16:35.411
I created an
expectation in you.

16:35.413 --> 16:38.114
When you were little, I always
let you win at everything.

16:38.116 --> 16:39.248
No, you didn't.

16:40.650 --> 16:43.002
Gin! Yay! I win, I win!

16:43.004 --> 16:46.186
I give up. Where are you?

16:46.221 --> 16:47.530
I'm right here!

16:47.565 --> 16:50.543
I'm so good, I don't even
have to hide my legs!

16:50.545 --> 16:51.711
I win again!

16:51.713 --> 16:54.597
- Oh!
- Yes! I win again!

16:54.599 --> 16:58.217
I'm stronger than a man!
I never need to get married!

17:00.071 --> 17:01.087
Why would you do that?

17:01.089 --> 17:02.722
Honey, when your
mother and I got divorced,

17:02.724 --> 17:05.358
we had such limited time, I
wanted to make it all positive.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.310
I only had every other weekend
to make you like me better.

17:08.313 --> 17:10.679
Guess that's why
I'm such a bad loser.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.186
Oh, are you kidding?
You're the worst.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.317
But the good news is,
we Roberts have a way

17:14.319 --> 17:15.952
of channeling our obsessive
behavior into our jobs.

17:15.954 --> 17:17.520
I once got so high,
I spent the entire day

17:17.521 --> 17:18.954
stacking potato chips
into little towers.

17:18.957 --> 17:20.906
I said, "Let's put 'em
in a can.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.375
Let's call 'em
Stacky Chips".

17:22.377 --> 17:24.210
I think they went
with another name.

17:24.212 --> 17:26.295
Pringles? One of our biggest
accounts?

17:26.297 --> 17:28.030
Yeah, but I like
Stacky Chips better.

17:28.031 --> 17:30.716
It says what it does.
You know, Stacky Chips.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.718
Well, if you're talking about
the Medal of Glory account,

17:32.720 --> 17:34.036
I'm not gonna win it.
I hate it.

17:34.038 --> 17:35.871
Honey, it doesn't matter.
Zach and Andrew have good ideas.

17:35.873 --> 17:37.206
We're gonna win this account.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.874
- I want to win it.
- Why?

17:38.876 --> 17:42.545
So I'm still the best
in your eyes.

17:42.547 --> 17:44.897
- Aside from Zach.
- Ah, that goes without saying.

17:44.899 --> 17:46.983
Maybe that's <i>my</i> thing.

17:47.935 --> 17:49.769
Maybe I saw you so little,

17:49.771 --> 17:51.854
that I thought
you would love me more

17:51.856 --> 17:53.022
if I was a winner.

17:53.024 --> 17:55.057
Wow, we really did a number
on each other.

17:55.394 --> 17:57.812
I'm gonna say it was more you.
I was five.

17:57.847 --> 17:59.042
Apology accepted.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.480
You think maybe we can
turn this thing off now?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.602
Oh, my God, look at me.
I'm a mess.

18:06.604 --> 18:10.289
I don't even recognize myself.

18:10.991 --> 18:12.241
Wait... I just had an idea.

18:12.243 --> 18:13.442
- What...
- Wait!

18:13.444 --> 18:15.077
That's another thing us
Roberts are addicted to:

18:15.079 --> 18:18.247
the dramatic reveal.

18:19.282 --> 18:21.116
I gotta be honest with you guys,
it wasn't easy

18:21.118 --> 18:22.668
coming up
with a campaign that captures

18:22.670 --> 18:25.554
the blunt reality of your game,
but I think we found it.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.141
I think we found it.

18:29.143 --> 18:31.460
- No! Do not pitch to them!
- Why not?

18:31.462 --> 18:32.845
Simon, I tried to stop her!

18:32.847 --> 18:34.764
What's gotten into her?
Has she gone mad?

18:34.766 --> 18:35.964
It's hysteria on the fact

18:35.966 --> 18:37.650
of the account of she's
an unmarried woman!

18:37.652 --> 18:38.684
What's happened to you?

18:38.686 --> 18:40.353
I think I'm allergic
to lip plumper.

18:40.355 --> 18:41.687
This game ruins
people's lives.

18:41.689 --> 18:43.305
Honey I don't think
this is the time or

18:43.307 --> 18:44.573
the place for this
unplanned intrusion.

18:44.575 --> 18:46.254
No, they need to know what
this game does to people.

18:46.338 --> 18:47.510
No, what do you mean?!

18:50.313 --> 18:52.031
You see before you
a normal pretty girl.

18:52.033 --> 18:54.083
Something your ilk
doesn't see very often.

18:54.085 --> 18:57.203
Oh, she got you, dude!
Burn!

18:57.205 --> 18:59.154
- She got you, too.
- Uh, yes.

18:59.156 --> 19:00.539
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:00.541 --> 19:03.943
This is me after four straight
days of playing your game.

19:03.945 --> 19:06.285
- I was hooked after the first kill.
- Oh, yeah.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.130
I fell down the rabbit hole,
and I fell hard.

19:08.132 --> 19:09.164
- Big time.
- It was ugly.

19:09.166 --> 19:12.167
I saw sides of myself that
I never wanted to know about.

19:12.169 --> 19:14.270
I went 17 straight hours
without a pee break.

19:14.272 --> 19:15.857
- Your best was 16.
- I know.

19:16.015 --> 19:16.760
But I would do it again

19:16.821 --> 19:17.919
- in a heartbeat.
- I'll bet.

19:17.959 --> 19:20.559
Because sitting there in
that chair playing that game,

19:20.561 --> 19:22.311
I have never felt
more alive.

19:22.313 --> 19:24.313
- Did it cost me?
- Oh, yeah.

19:24.315 --> 19:26.232
- You bet it did.
- Us, too.

19:26.234 --> 19:28.984
But I wouldn't trade it
for anything, because that...

19:31.238 --> 19:33.205
...is the face of a winner.

19:33.207 --> 19:35.291
And I'm not alone.

19:38.028 --> 19:41.964
<i>Medal of Glory...</i>
a game so realistic,

19:41.966 --> 19:45.918
you can't help but come out
of it scarred for life.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.052
Yes, yes,
that is amazing.

19:47.054 --> 19:49.255
- We are in!
- Ha!

19:50.206 --> 19:52.508
- No.
- That's cool. I'll call you.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.760
- No, you won't.
- Dude, social cues.

19:54.762 --> 19:56.378
You done with war?

19:56.380 --> 19:57.847
- Oh, yeah.
- Welcome back, son.

19:57.849 --> 20:00.316
- You know I'm a girl, right?
- A guy can dream.

20:00.318 --> 20:01.400
That is bad.

20:01.402 --> 20:02.651
Yeah, it's definitely
getting bigger.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.186
What happens if it
doesn't stop plumping?

20:04.188 --> 20:06.792
I'm not sure, but I have
an epi pen in my pocket.

20:06.827 --> 20:08.407
If I pass out, you'll have
to stab me with it, okay?

20:08.409 --> 20:10.693
- Okay. You win.
- Just stab me with it.

20:10.695 --> 20:11.994
I win.

20:12.616 --> 20:16.122
- Sync by YesCool, corrections by Zac -
- www.addic7ed.com -

20:16.284 --> 20:17.633
Kick ass! I'm a fruit!

20:17.635 --> 20:20.402
- Do it right here.
- I've got cabbage in my belly button.

20:20.404 --> 20:21.420
Right there.

20:21.422 --> 20:24.957
- Got salad in every crevasse.
- I got kale in my eyes.

20:26.377 --> 20:27.676
That's vegetable theater.

20:27.678 --> 20:29.345
"Your addictions
brought back

20:29.347 --> 20:33.582
painful memories of my mother,
waking up to a chicken."

20:35.886 --> 20:37.970
I gotta go talk to her!

20:37.972 --> 20:39.522
Damn it, woman, can't you see

20:39.524 --> 20:41.690
we're trying to open
the door here!

20:41.692 --> 20:43.776
I have an epi pen
in my pocket.

20:43.778 --> 20:45.895
If I pass out,
stab me with it.

20:47.564 --> 20:48.686
This isn't funny.

20:48.866 --> 20:51.150
Lauren is a sad loser.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.988
She's not a loser anymore.
