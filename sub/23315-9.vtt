WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.900
Oi, oi! We're back!

00:16.467 --> 00:18.967
Get me back in that house.
Ah!

00:19.033 --> 00:21.933
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.767
Oh. My. God.

00:27.967 --> 00:31.100
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in my
knickers.

00:38.967 --> 00:41.900
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:41.967 --> 00:43.567
Bucking...

00:43.633 --> 00:45.400
...necking...

00:45.467 --> 00:46.867
...and drinking.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.300
Toon, we are coming for you.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.600
Shit's about to go down.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.967
This is mint.

01:02.367 --> 01:05.167
Morning, you bunch of pissheads.
Marnie's back!

01:05.233 --> 01:09.433
Chloe, your behaviour last
night,
totally unacceptable. No
drinking.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.600
Loads of cock in Edinburgh!

01:12.667 --> 01:14.000
(screaming)

01:14.067 --> 01:16.833
I'm sorry for what happened.
I want to continue.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.033
Sam has finally admitted
he's in the wrong.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.633
Fuck me, that girl
has got pissed again!

01:27.033 --> 01:30.867
That is fate. We are going to
get
married and have kids tomorrow.

01:33.733 --> 01:37.400
My boyfriend's not here and I
want
a cuddle. Does that really
matter?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.200
Don't dare bring
my boyfriend into it!

01:41.267 --> 01:45.233
As a friend, you would never
have brought that up. Fuck off!

01:48.233 --> 01:50.800
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:50.867 --> 01:53.800
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:53.867 --> 01:56.633
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.600
I'm preened to perfection.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.867
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:00.933 --> 02:03.600
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.333
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.667
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:10.366 --> 02:12.433
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:32.433 --> 02:36.500
Last night I got so pissed off
with
Aaron and Marnie, I pissed the
bed.

02:36.567 --> 02:38.367
I've had to go sleep on the
sofa.

02:45.967 --> 02:48.467
I've woken up and Nathan
is nowhere to be seen.

02:48.533 --> 02:50.500
Smells like
a fucking urinal in here.

02:50.567 --> 02:52.700
I know he was pissed off
at us last night,

02:52.767 --> 02:54.967
and if this is his revenge,
it's worked.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.333
How you feeling? What even
happened?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.467
Someone laughing makes it worse.

02:59.533 --> 03:02.733
We were all laughing
cos we were winding each other
up.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.500
And you know what it was?
You had too much to drink.

03:05.567 --> 03:08.967
I think one joke went too far
and it just upset us.

03:09.033 --> 03:10.867
I don't think she meant
anything.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.133
Last night,
I was missing my boyfriend.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.800
Then Marnie made jokes about him
on the way home.

03:15.867 --> 03:19.833
I don't make fun of her
partners,
so what she said felt
insensitive

03:19.900 --> 03:21.067
and I lost my shit.

03:21.133 --> 03:24.433
Just chill a bit
and speak to her later.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.633
Get it squashed
before the nights out,

03:26.700 --> 03:30.633
cos as soon as drink's involved,
it can get blown out of
proportion.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.367
Thank you for coming to see me.

03:32.433 --> 03:36.067
I do appreciate Aaron coming to
see
us, especially after last night.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.633
But I'm not ready
to talk to Marnie just yet.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.200
How was your first night back
on the town?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.867
Really, really good.
I was such a good drunk.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.267
I felt great being back
with the family.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.700
When I'm not here
I miss these radgies.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.933
Especially Aaron cos his
friendship
means the world to us.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.800
Did Nathan kick off?
Mm-hmm.

03:57.867 --> 04:01.033
I know what was on his mind
that made him switch.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.833
What was that?

04:02.900 --> 04:06.800
I think I said, like, that Aaron
was gonna shag his boyfriend.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.200
Oh, for God's sake.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.267
I know Nathan very well.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.600
And I know you do not mess with
him
when it comes to his man.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.433
He's gonna hold a grudge
all day long.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.632
Where the hell is Chloe
this morning?

04:19.700 --> 04:21.867
She was shagging all night.
Again.

04:21.933 --> 04:24.100
Chloe goes from one extreme
to the other.

04:24.167 --> 04:26.633
One night she's throwing
chicken nuggets

04:26.700 --> 04:29.800
and the next she's throwing
her vagina in his face.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.400
It's gonna be very hard

04:31.467 --> 04:34.833
for two people to be in a proper
relationship in this house

04:34.900 --> 04:37.800
I don't know how I see it
working.

04:40.933 --> 04:44.033
Do you know, Chloe, I had
a really good night last night.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.667
Why you laughing?

04:45.733 --> 04:47.833
I just remember
a lot of creepy things.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.533
This morning
I have woke up with a fear.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.700
What the hell
was I saying last night?

04:52.767 --> 04:56.667
I think we both said, "Love
you."
We never.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.133
I was mortal last night

04:58.200 --> 05:01.200
and you can tell cos of
the cringey shit I was spouting.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.800
They say the truth comes out
when you're drunk.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.233
Do you think you meant it?

05:06.633 --> 05:08.733
Nearly. Not in love yet. Nearly.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.033
Don't get us wrong, I do like
Sam.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.267
I don't love him yet. Once I
know
I love him, I will tell him.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.767
You know how we accidentally
say,

05:16.833 --> 05:19.700
"Noodles", or "pasta",
or "beetroot"?

05:19.767 --> 05:21.700
I've never accidentally said it.

05:21.767 --> 05:25.300
How has Sam never accidentally
said "beetroot"? Everyone does.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.600
(laughs)

05:30.300 --> 05:32.100
Morning.
What's happening, Abs?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.333
Hello, babes, all right?
Morning.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.533
All the others are down
for breakfast

05:38.600 --> 05:40.233
and I'm not in the mood to chat.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.767
I'm gonna stay here and see if
Marnie's big enough to
apologise.

05:43.833 --> 05:47.033
I'm gonna put a tracksuit on.
I'm in last night's clothes.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.033
I do need a shower.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.467
Typical Marnie. I'm sat here
waiting for an apology

05:52.533 --> 05:55.233
and the lazy bitch
has gone back to bed.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.533
She can stay there
as far as I'm concerned.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.000
Keep an eye on the sausages.
Where you going?

06:00.067 --> 06:01.200
To get something.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.600
Since Chloe and Sam
have got together,

06:03.667 --> 06:07.233
they've been up and down
more than the Shag Pad mattress.

06:07.300 --> 06:12.033
So I've got a plan that might
make
their relationship a lot better.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.300
What the fuck is that?
I've got a plan.

06:14.367 --> 06:16.633
You are in the wrong,
but never admit.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.867
Yeah?
The way to get over that

06:18.933 --> 06:24.200
is to publicly tell the world
about how yous are in the wrong.

06:24.267 --> 06:25.367
What do you mean?

06:25.433 --> 06:28.567
Put them over yourself,
walk around and tell the world.

06:28.633 --> 06:29.800
Fuck's sake.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.267
Sophie wants us to
put our thoughts on a board

06:32.333 --> 06:36.633
and go around showing everyone.
What the fuck does that mean?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.667
Am I going to be
therapied after this?

06:38.733 --> 06:40.500
It will make yous more in love.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.400
I know Sophie is only looking
out
for me and Sam,

06:43.467 --> 06:45.833
but howay, pet,
this is pure embarrassing.

06:49.567 --> 06:53.033
Right. I'm going to do
the other side of the board.

06:53.100 --> 06:57.767
You should put your downfall is
not
knowing when you're in the
wrong.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.400
Think before you speak.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.833
Only be interested
in one girl and honest.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.133
This is pretty fun, cos I'm
telling Sam all of his faults.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.933
I don't think he's liking it.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.067
Voila!

07:09.133 --> 07:10.700
One, two, three...

07:10.767 --> 07:12.100
Crazy, angry...

07:12.167 --> 07:16.000
I should only be interested
in one girl.

07:16.067 --> 07:19.633
I've no idea if shaming
ourselves
in public will help me and
Chloe,

07:19.700 --> 07:23.000
and I'm dreading it, but if it
works, it's got to be worth a
go.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.033
You've spelled "wrong" wrong.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.333
How? Ruh-Oh-Nuh-Guh. Rong.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.867
I swear, you two are
as stupid as each other.

07:29.933 --> 07:34.767
Before Sam and Chloe go out, I
need
someone who's gonna draw the
crowd

07:34.833 --> 07:36.833
and be loud as a foghorn.

07:36.900 --> 07:41.700
So, I think, Nathan, you are
amazing at embracing outfits.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.533
So, I think this one
would be perfect for you.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.467
Is Sophie taking the fucking
piss?

07:47.533 --> 07:51.300
This was her idea. Why the hell
am I being roped into this?

07:51.367 --> 07:54.433
You look like you're from the
1940s.
(bell rings)

07:54.500 --> 07:57.200
Don't give him
some sort of musical instrument.

07:57.267 --> 08:02.000
Nathan loves playing with
bellends.
He can ring it as much as he
wants.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.200
Come and check the dickheads
out!

08:04.267 --> 08:07.633
Nathan is gonna ring a bell.
That is gonna get more
attention.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.000
For fuck's sake,
could this day get worse?

08:10.067 --> 08:13.167
Ring-a-ding-a-ling.
Bye!

08:17.533 --> 08:20.867
Sophie thinks Sam and Chloe
sharing all their issues they
have

08:20.933 --> 08:24.000
in public will help
all their problems.

08:24.067 --> 08:27.933
I'm not too sure, but I'm happy
to be here to humiliate them.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.433
Show them your embarrassing
thing.
Shame! Shame! Shame!

08:32.500 --> 08:36.000
Tell people what's wrong with
you.
Tell them what you did to Sam.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.100
I'm a psycho!

08:37.167 --> 08:39.000
Nathan is fucking loving this.

08:39.067 --> 08:42.433
But we are in Newcastle town
centre,
it is pure chocka.

08:42.500 --> 08:46.533
Shame! Shame! Shame! I'm not
crazy!
I'm not gonna kick off any more.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.667
I'm only going to speak to one
girl.
I have been cleansed.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.267
Not gonna kick off any more.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.333
I might look, sound and feel
like a proper twat out here,

08:55.400 --> 08:57.200
but it's for Chloe and Sam's
good.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.400
I am not crazy.
I'm not gonna kick off.

08:59.467 --> 09:02.433
I am not a bad person.
I am not a bad person.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.400
I cannot pick my head up. If I
can't see them, they can't see
me.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.267
I am not crazy!

09:08.333 --> 09:11.233
And I like Sam!
I am not a bad person!

09:11.300 --> 09:13.567
I'm done! I'm done! I'm done!

09:13.633 --> 09:16.467
I'm done.
I'm not being a sandwich no
more.

09:16.533 --> 09:20.433
This board can do one. Weirdly,
I feel like it's done us good.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.533
Being humiliated in public,
I feel closer to Sam already.

09:25.767 --> 09:28.267
Very proud of you.
Can't believe it.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.567
At first it was embarrassing,
but then I started to enjoy it.

09:31.633 --> 09:34.433
Shall we do a cheers
to feeling cleansed?

09:34.500 --> 09:37.167
Forget cleansing,
how are you feeling?

09:37.233 --> 09:39.400
I am all for taking
the piss of each other,

09:39.467 --> 09:41.967
but I feel when people bring
your partner in...

09:42.033 --> 09:44.100
It's different, isn't it? Yeah.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.767
I thought Marnie
was being very insensitive.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.167
I'm really offended
and I want an apology.

09:49.233 --> 09:52.033
Tonight, I think you need
to tell them how you feel.

09:52.100 --> 09:56.267
You know what it is? I'll
forgive,
but I'll never forget.

10:03.267 --> 10:07.733
(bell ringing)
(all) Shame! Shame! Shame!

10:07.800 --> 10:09.800
(all) Shame! Shame!

10:09.867 --> 10:12.067
I had a wicked day
chilling in the house.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.400
Now these pricks are back
making a racket.

10:14.467 --> 10:18.233
The bell's going to disappear up
Nathan's arse if he rings it
again.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.500
The most embarrassing thing
I've done.

10:20.567 --> 10:24.000
Can you do a demonstration?
I will never smash anything
again!

10:24.067 --> 10:25.333
Sam...

10:25.400 --> 10:27.833
I will only talk to one girl
at one time!

10:27.900 --> 10:29.467
That is fucking liberty.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.767
All that aside,
do you feel it's worked?

10:31.833 --> 10:33.733
Do you feel you released demons?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.300
I feel like I'd never
do anything wrong again.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.967
If Sam's saying today worked,

10:38.033 --> 10:40.900
then obviously Chloe and Sam
got something out of it,

10:40.967 --> 10:42.933
and I've obviously done a good
job.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.567
Today's been amazing.
I've got all my ins out.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.000
You feel like a new woman?

10:47.067 --> 10:50.167
A new woman.
I'm gonna get ready for tonight.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.833
I have cleansed my voice box
in a lot of ways today.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.267
I need to cleanse
something else, my throat,

10:55.333 --> 10:57.467
by getting absolutely
mortal tonight.

10:57.533 --> 11:01.467
(all) Shame! Shame! Shame!

11:02.533 --> 11:05.733
Her breath smells pure lush,
fanny is shaved,

11:05.800 --> 11:07.900
now fuck off out my barber's.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.767
Zoom in on this.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.933
(camera clicks)
Put the flash on.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.133
We're not well.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

11:21.000 --> 11:21.200
.

11:23.700 --> 11:23.900
.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.000
We're getting our slap on

11:36.067 --> 11:38.967
and I can't wait
to hit the Toon and get mortal.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.267
Haven't seen much of Nathan
today.
What's he been like?

11:42.333 --> 11:45.300
I had a chat with him today,
he was quite upset.

11:45.367 --> 11:50.100
Nathan can sometimes get annoyed
at us and be a bit snappy.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.567
If he gets snappy at us,
we'll do it back.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.367
I know. That's what annoys us.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.667
He can't pick and choose.
He gets personal with us as
well.

11:57.733 --> 12:00.167
Marnie is being really stubborn.

12:00.233 --> 12:04.067
Hopefully her and Nathan sort it
out, cos I want a good night.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.800
Lads! I've not seen Nathan
since breakfast.

12:08.867 --> 12:12.533
And he's still got a face
like a smacked arse with
eyeliner.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.333
No, I'm not apologising,
you overreacting prick.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.367
You can dish it out,
but can't take it.

12:17.433 --> 12:21.567
I think this cheers is for
Nathan.
Why?

12:21.633 --> 12:23.033
Problem with the weeing,

12:23.100 --> 12:25.667
it needs to stop
and something needs to happen.

12:25.733 --> 12:27.167
These are for you.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.033
Look at them! Look at them!

12:29.100 --> 12:31.467
And look, they're size large
for your willy.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.567
(laughter)

12:32.633 --> 12:35.767
Put them on and it'll protect
you
from weeing the bed.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.033
When you get in tonight,
just wear them.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.333
I think you should be very
happy.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.833
I can rock a fucking paper bag
if I needed to.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.833
If Sophie wants me to wear this
cos
it gets her off, then I'll do
it.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.367
Thank you for thinking of me.
You're welcome.

12:49.433 --> 12:50.767
Can't wait to wear them.

12:50.833 --> 12:54.000
Tonight, I want everyone
to get absolutely hammered
again.

12:54.067 --> 12:57.700
Cheers tonight to pissy pants.
(all) Pissy pants!

12:58.733 --> 13:01.600
Let's get in the fucking cars
and get to the club.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.633
I want to get drunk.

13:05.567 --> 13:09.200
We're going to House of Smith,
one of the best nights in
Newcastle.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.867
I know for a fact
we're gonna have a good night.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.900
We've arrived and the club
is bouncing.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.933
I cannot wait
to have a drink down me.

13:52.300 --> 13:56.500
I know I do say I love you a
lot,
but I do nearly mean it with
Sam.

13:56.567 --> 14:00.200
I'm just being careful cos I've
been hurt so much in the past.

14:09.133 --> 14:12.367
Since being in this house,
I haven't had more than a neck
on.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.867
I've got that much built-up
frustration. I need to release
it.

14:21.167 --> 14:25.033
I'd love to find a boy tonight,
and
if he's fit, I will take him
home,

14:25.100 --> 14:26.933
but it's hard to find at the
minute.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.633
Nathan and Marnie
still haven't spoken.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.233
Bullshit is starting
to ruin the atmosphere.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.533
I'm gonna make her apologise
so we can have a good night.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.467
For fuck's sake,
I'm always the one apologising.

14:56.533 --> 14:59.100
I don't think Aaron and Sophie
are gonna drop it.

14:59.167 --> 15:01.567
So I'm gonna take one for the
team.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.900
What is the purpose
of Marnie coming over?

15:06.967 --> 15:08.700
Is it to argue or apologise?

15:08.767 --> 15:11.233
Either way,
nothing's getting resolved.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.900
You're admitting
that you overreacted.

15:20.967 --> 15:23.067
That means
I didn't do anything wrong.

15:23.133 --> 15:24.967
That's what I said the whole
time.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.167
I might be dramatic, but I got
my apology. That's all I wanted.

15:36.233 --> 15:37.833
So sucks to be you, bitch.

15:43.033 --> 15:45.567
I spot the lad
that I got with the other night.

15:45.633 --> 15:46.833
And his mate.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.867
Steph, this could be
your lucky night.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.167
Abbie's lad's not too shabby.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.967
But I prefer his tall,
dark, handsome mate.

15:56.033 --> 15:58.267
We're gonna bring them over
for a drink.

16:00.767 --> 16:04.333
I've only had one sip and
Abbie's
proper necking on with her lad.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.733
I mean, two can play
at that game though.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.567
I am buzzing these two have
pulled,

16:11.633 --> 16:14.200
but I'm not gonna get sprayed
in their saliva.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.100
I'm off to find my man.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.700
It looks like Abbie and Steph
want the Shag Pad.

16:30.767 --> 16:32.933
They have to get through
me and Sam first.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.800
I'm loving being with Marnie.
It could have been awkward,

16:43.867 --> 16:45.500
but our friendship is strong.

16:45.567 --> 16:47.800
Speaking of strong,
what's that smell?

16:51.033 --> 16:53.733
Howay, Marns, have you not
washed,
you dirty twat?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.067
You've let your standards slip.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.900
I wanna take my lad home
tonight,

17:05.967 --> 17:09.067
but he cannot see my vagina
in this mess.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.900
Once we get back to the house,
I'll give you the Chloe
treatment.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.532
I look at Sam and I'm sure
he's checking out some pretty
girls.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.833
Hang on a minute.

17:21.900 --> 17:25.333
Only today he was shouting
he'd never talk to another girl.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.267
He better not be mugging us off.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.233
What do you want me to do?
Walk around with a blindfold?

17:37.233 --> 17:41.400
Ah, shit, I've screwed up.
I like Sam so much I've got
jealous.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.333
I've opened my mouth
and I think he's really angry.

17:53.367 --> 17:57.133
I thought shaming earlier was
meant
to kill her insecurities about
me,

17:57.200 --> 18:01.433
not bloody give them a second
wind.
I can't help it. I'm fucking
fuming.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.600
(whistles)

18:06.867 --> 18:10.667
Tonight has been wicked
and I have managed to pull.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.000
So let's get this lad home
pronto.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.533
We get back
and Abbie needs my help
desperately.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.733
I'm gonna shave her fanny.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.967
Do you want some food?

18:29.033 --> 18:31.233
I'm in charge of
distracting Abbie's lad

18:31.300 --> 18:33.867
while Chloe MOTs her
undercarriage.

18:33.933 --> 18:36.067
What's your name again?
Mark. Mark.

18:36.133 --> 18:38.433
I've given him a kebab and
Marnie.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.500
That should keep him distracted
for about five minutes.

18:41.567 --> 18:45.633
Abbie, that is the most ugliest
thing
I've ever seen in my life! Sit
down.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.300
Operation Shaven Haven
is in full force.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.800
Ah! Ah! Don't dry shave.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.733
So, lass, what do you want
today?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.733
Short back and sides? Brazilian?
Long cut? Short cut?

18:55.800 --> 18:56.933
The option's yours.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.200
I have not looked
at nobody all night.

18:59.267 --> 19:03.000
Sam... I have not looked
at nobody all night.

19:03.067 --> 19:05.567
Once again,
Steph's fucked up on the lad
front.

19:05.633 --> 19:09.133
She's more interested in her
kebab
and her lad's done one.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.567
When they get involved with a
girl,
they will lose their heads.

19:14.633 --> 19:18.033
I've not done a single thing.
It's annoying me.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.133
Oh, shit. I really thought
my shaming idea had worked
today.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.700
Chloe's insecurity has got the
best
of her and that pissed Sam off.

19:25.767 --> 19:28.767
Between me and you,
tonight it's pushed me away.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.733
Open your mouth!
Abbie, come here, open it.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.700
Come here,
this is what I do with Sam.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.600
Breath smells pure lush,
fanny is shaved perfectly,

19:42.667 --> 19:44.633
now fuck off out my barber's.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.700
Go to your big boy. Go see your
boy.

19:47.767 --> 19:51.200
Marnie, take a picture
of my asshole for Abbie's
camera.

19:51.267 --> 19:54.133
We're getting ready for bed
and I find Abbie's camera.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.133
I wanna give her a gift to
remember
her time in the house, my
asshole.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.900
Get right in. Don't look.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.500
I'm eating, man.

20:01.567 --> 20:04.733
I've heard of a pinhole camera,
but not an arsehole camera.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.633
Abbie's in for a treat.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.033
(camera clicks)

20:12.900 --> 20:15.333
It looks like a vagina.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.567
Howay, Marnie, there's no way
that Nathan's brown star

20:18.633 --> 20:20.200
looks like a vagina.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.900
I'll prove it to you.
Zoom in on this.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.233
Yous, it reeks.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.267
You need to put the flash on
(laughter)

20:27.333 --> 20:30.233
What is our obsession
with holes in this house?

20:30.300 --> 20:31.833
Wow.
Is that the clit there?

20:31.900 --> 20:33.600
We're not well.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.200
I don't know
what's going on down here.

20:38.267 --> 20:41.167
I left Sophie to look after my
lad
for five minutes.

20:41.233 --> 20:45.200
I come back and it's just kebab
carnage and a shit-faced Steph
here.

20:51.433 --> 20:53.500
Hi, stranger.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.267
I actually wanted
some action tonight.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.300
But my lad's done one
cos he's got work in the
morning.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.000
I'm going to fucking
sleep this cunt off.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.167
I need to sleep this fucking
motherfucker hangover off.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.633
I've come to the Shag Pad
with my lad,

21:17.700 --> 21:21.867
but I can help but feel sorry
for
Steph that her lad had to go
home.

21:21.933 --> 21:24.200
Not really, I'm getting my shag
on.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.433
What?
I'm sorry.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.867
Sam is still angry with us, cos
I said he was checking out
girls.

21:36.933 --> 21:40.833
But he needs to realise it's
gonna
take me a long time to trust a
boy.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.600
Cos we're not official,
I don't know where we are.

21:43.667 --> 21:47.400
I have been told by Abbie,
by a few people,

21:47.467 --> 21:49.967
that you are a massive player
around your area.

21:50.033 --> 21:53.567
Chloe is telling me on the
outside
I'm a player, do this, do that,

21:53.633 --> 21:56.533
but has she not realised
I'm being different with her?

21:56.600 --> 21:59.967
I've opened up and told the girl
I like her. What more can I do?

22:03.300 --> 22:05.433
I thought you were going to bed?

22:05.500 --> 22:08.633
I hate arguing with Chloe
because I like her so much,

22:08.700 --> 22:11.567
so we just need to sleep on it
and deal with it tomorrow.

22:11.633 --> 22:13.233
And when I say sleep on it...

22:16.967 --> 22:19.567
Want to see how much
you trust each other?

22:19.633 --> 22:22.033
(laughter)

22:22.100 --> 22:24.900
What is your one bit of advice
to Sam?

22:26.433 --> 22:28.933
Oh, Sam, that was so good.
Nathan!

22:29.000 --> 22:31.467
Finally, I got something
in the hole!

22:31.533 --> 22:33.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:36.467 --> 22:36.667
.

22:39.167 --> 22:39.367
.

22:49.833 --> 22:53.333
I have had a great night with my
lad, but he's got to go to work.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.367
I would walk you to the door,
pet,
but I am fucked.

22:56.433 --> 22:57.967
In both ways.

23:03.267 --> 23:05.433
I was looking for
a lie-in this morning.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.867
But I've had a message from my
dad,
and he needs help at the
restaurant.

23:09.933 --> 23:13.867
So I better get my hungover arse
over there ASAP.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.067
Fucking knackered.
This bed is fucking shit.

23:19.133 --> 23:21.533
Where the fuck is Sophie?
She was here.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.767
She's went to see her dad
for a catch-up.

23:23.833 --> 23:26.333
Last night was very funny
when we got back here.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.167
I really enjoyed
the taking of the pictures.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.100
I feel like it brought us all
close.

23:31.167 --> 23:34.033
I woke up this morning
and the first thing I remembered

23:34.100 --> 23:36.967
is taking a picture of my
arsehole
on Abbie's camera.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.267
What the fuck
was I thinking last night?

23:39.333 --> 23:41.000
What happened to your lad?

23:41.067 --> 23:45.900
Basically, he had work
and he was like, "Oh. Gotta go."

23:45.967 --> 23:48.467
I'm actually so devastated
this morning.

23:48.533 --> 23:52.567
How I thought I was gonna get my
leg
over, and it was an epic
failure.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.133
Last night when I was talking
to Chloe and Sam,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.633
Chloe was telling me she
accidentally dropped the L-bomb.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.933
Nathan's saying Chloe thinks
she's in love with Sam.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.300
Sorry, you can't
fall in love that quickly.

24:04.367 --> 24:07.633
You can love someone,
but you can't be in love, no
way.

24:10.633 --> 24:12.767
I've woken up
and I'm still pissed off.

24:12.833 --> 24:15.567
Normally when I sleep
I wake up in a better mood,

24:15.633 --> 24:17.233
but I cannot let this go.

24:17.300 --> 24:20.033
The thing is, Chloe,
you have something in your head

24:20.100 --> 24:22.200
where you think I'm talking to
girls.

24:22.267 --> 24:25.500
I think it's cos I'm so used
to someone else doing that to
us.

24:25.567 --> 24:29.333
I've just got a lot of
insecurities
and Sam needs to realise that.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.233
I want to fall in love with you,
but I'm scared to.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.767
I do understand, because she's
been
in difficult positions.

24:35.833 --> 24:39.567
I wanna give her the benefit of
the doubt. Forget about it.
Done.

24:39.633 --> 24:42.267
This is why I love...
I mean like Sam.

24:42.333 --> 24:45.200
He's so understanding,
I need to learn to trust him.

24:45.267 --> 24:48.633
Do you know when we were having
sex?
We were arguing during sex.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.833
We weren't.
We were, we were arguing.

24:51.900 --> 24:55.867
"You were talking to girls!"
"No, I fucking wasn't!"

24:55.933 --> 24:58.633
Cos we were arguing,
we were getting more into it.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.500
And I think I come'd.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.867
I can't stay angry at Chloe
for long cos I like her so much.

25:03.933 --> 25:05.833
The old Chloe would have kicked
off.

25:05.900 --> 25:10.400
She didn't. We just talked it
through
and sorted it. Happy days.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.933
Does this mean we're friends
again?
Of course.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.633
Yous, come on!

25:20.700 --> 25:22.233
Breakfast is served!

25:22.300 --> 25:25.067
I am starving,
but Marnie is a shit cook.

25:25.133 --> 25:28.000
So that means these sausages
are gonna be ruined.

25:28.067 --> 25:31.300
Eurgh, it honestly stinks.
I didn't really fancy that.

25:31.367 --> 25:32.867
Go for it, Sam, just eat it.

25:32.933 --> 25:35.867
I have had many a thing
in my mouth...

25:35.933 --> 25:38.767
Actually, no, I haven't.
(laughs)

25:38.833 --> 25:40.733
Nathan, that one looks like
yours.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
That one?
That's a double of Nathan.

25:42.867 --> 25:46.467
Oh, my God, I never knew
that Nathan's willy had a twin!

25:46.533 --> 25:49.533
Oh, my God!
(laughter)

25:49.600 --> 25:50.833
Add a few inches to it.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.467
My dick's more caramel,
large sausage.

25:53.533 --> 25:55.867
This is more burnt chipolata.

25:55.933 --> 25:58.267
Why don't we leave some for
Abbie?
Yeah.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.200
I think Abbie got enough
sausage.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.433
Where is she?
Shagged a lad.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.267
Abbie!

26:04.333 --> 26:06.433
(applause)
Shagger! Shagger!

26:06.500 --> 26:08.733
(chanting) Shagger! Shagger!
Shagger!

26:11.767 --> 26:13.233
After a night's hard graft,

26:13.300 --> 26:16.367
it's good to know the others
are appreciative of my work.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.767
I hope they've left me
some breakfast.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.567
Quite a few of us
found our hole last night.

26:21.633 --> 26:25.267
So, those who didn't are going
to
play mini golf so they can find
it.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.567
Sam wants to go play mini golf.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.833
What the fuck is this boy
thinking?

26:29.900 --> 26:32.933
Listen, I'm gonna stay here.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.400
Can't think of anything worse.
I'm hungover and it's freezing.

26:36.467 --> 26:38.733
I'd rather stay here
and clean the house.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.367
I'm gonna stay home.
Not you as well!

26:41.433 --> 26:44.867
Surprise, surprise, if Aaron's
not going, Marnie's not going.

26:44.933 --> 26:48.533
These two are inseparable.
They're like human Velcro.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.100
Howay.
Get ready for golf

27:00.333 --> 27:02.500
Come on. It's your idea.

27:02.567 --> 27:05.233
Taking golf a bit too serious
with the outfit.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.300
Hello.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.667
I must've missed the memo.
I'm dressed like a fucking
farmer.

27:09.733 --> 27:11.267
What do you wear to mini golf?

27:11.333 --> 27:14.033
Them tops are the illest things
I've ever seen.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.200
I don't know why they're
laughing.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.033
They're staying at home
cleaning the dishes.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.533
Let's go then.
Howay, I wanna get it done.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.167
I'm gonna be shitty.
Howay then.

27:24.233 --> 27:26.200
Bye!
Enjoy.

27:30.633 --> 27:33.967
Eh, fancy seeing you here.
Hello there.

27:36.467 --> 27:38.500
What was that?

27:38.567 --> 27:39.967
Fucking hell.

27:42.533 --> 27:45.167
This is gonna be a long game.

27:45.233 --> 27:47.100
(laughter)
Right, let's go.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.600
Hand cream?

27:50.667 --> 27:52.900
I like to have wet hands
when I take a ball.

27:52.967 --> 27:56.600
Nathan, what are you lubing up
for?
It's a golf club, not a dildo.

27:58.033 --> 27:59.233
That was quite good.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.767
Finally, I got something
in the hole.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.367
Well done, Steph!
Thank you.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.133
That's all I wanted.

28:08.267 --> 28:11.767
Fuck.
Nathan is absolutely terrible.

28:13.267 --> 28:16.300
Fuck.
I'm gonna teach him how to play.

28:16.367 --> 28:19.033
Slight bend in the knees,
right, OK?

28:19.100 --> 28:22.167
It's been a while since
anyone's got that close to my
bum,

28:22.233 --> 28:24.867
so I'd be careful in case
you get swallowed whole.

28:25.867 --> 28:27.933
Oh, Sam, that was so good.
Nathan!

28:28.000 --> 28:31.467
Everybody's just taking the
piss.
I wish I came by myself.

28:40.733 --> 28:43.433
I went out with a top knot
and a nightie last night.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.067
Golf is shite.

28:45.133 --> 28:48.133
And me and Steph are two birdies
that have had enough.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.533
It's time for a chat.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.433
The one night I don't make an
effort
and I see him.

28:52.500 --> 28:56.400
I thought you liked my dress?
Oh, sorry, it's your dress.

28:56.467 --> 28:57.667
Sorry.

28:57.733 --> 29:00.767
It's nothing to do with the
dress.
It's your shit pulling.

29:00.833 --> 29:04.233
I got told this morning,
apparently the night before
last,

29:04.300 --> 29:08.133
that Chloe said the L word to
Sam.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.433
Really?!
The L word.

29:10.500 --> 29:14.867
Chloe is moving very fast.
I just hope Sam is on the same
page.

29:14.933 --> 29:18.700
Do you not think they should
be boyfriend and girlfriend?

29:18.767 --> 29:21.667
I think it's great that Chloe
and Sam are going so well,

29:21.733 --> 29:24.667
but I don't get why Abbie's
being such a negative ninny.

29:24.733 --> 29:26.833
I'm picturing the wedding day.

29:26.900 --> 29:31.500
I do just hope he's on the same
page.
Do you know what I mean?

29:31.567 --> 29:35.800
Something's telling me she
doesn't
think Sam's that that
trustworthy.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.967
Howay then,
where the fuck is this ball?

29:39.033 --> 29:41.133
There it is!

29:41.200 --> 29:44.133
I got a bit drunk last night
and I feel like

29:44.200 --> 29:46.367
I am very close to loving Sam.

29:46.433 --> 29:49.167
I am buzzing me and Nathan
are having a chat today.

29:49.233 --> 29:52.833
He's always very honest with us
and I need some advice right
now.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.533
I've got so many insecurities
from the past.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.033
I thought that was Martin
doing that. My mind still...

29:59.100 --> 30:02.200
You need to realise
he is not Martin. That is Sam.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.233
If anything, out of all the boys
you got with, he's the most
honest.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.567
It is hard to listen
to Nathan's advice,

30:08.633 --> 30:12.267
but I know it's right. I need to
trust Sam before I push him
away.

30:12.333 --> 30:15.600
I think with my head. I've
hardly got any marbles in my
head.

30:15.667 --> 30:17.533
Exactly.
I should go with my heart.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.000
Don't drink as much tonight
then.
I promise.

30:20.067 --> 30:21.867
I cannot fuck this one up.

30:21.933 --> 30:26.433
For some reason, this time
around
I've turned into some wise
oracle.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.700
It must be the non-sex I'm
having.
It's turned me into a fucking
saint.

30:30.767 --> 30:35.233
Sam, it's freezing, but I've
enjoyed
my day, so thank you very much.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.100
Golf has been pure shite.

30:37.167 --> 30:39.400
Let's get back
and get ready for tonight.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.667
Oh, howay, man.

30:46.733 --> 30:50.900
I didn't realise a washer
could make clothes more dirty.

30:52.567 --> 30:56.000
To be fair, how do you reckon
Sam and Chloe are getting on?

30:56.067 --> 30:59.233
Obviously I can relate to Chloe
cos I remember when I told you

30:59.300 --> 31:01.867
I loved you and you didn't
say it back, remember?

31:01.933 --> 31:05.633
Marnie, the difference is, you
told
me you loved us after three
years,

31:05.700 --> 31:09.467
not three minutes, the amount
Chloe and Sam have known each
other.

31:09.533 --> 31:12.933
What is your one bit
of advice to Sam

31:13.000 --> 31:16.600
knowing what you know
from your past with me?

31:16.667 --> 31:19.233
Don't get with anyone in the
house.
(laughs)

31:19.300 --> 31:21.933
I'm joking. (laughs)

31:22.000 --> 31:24.567
Be honest.
Cos for a long time I wasn't.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.367
So be honest.

31:26.433 --> 31:28.567
Right. OK.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.233
That fucking shut you up, didn't
it?

31:32.200 --> 31:35.667
Finally, Aaron is admitting
the reason why we didn't work
out.

31:35.733 --> 31:38.467
Maybe if he'd put his neck
on the line and been honest

31:38.533 --> 31:40.600
things might have been
different.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.533
Hello! Oh, my God, it's very
clean.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.767
We're back from golf and I can't
wait to tell Aaron and Marnie

31:49.833 --> 31:51.700
exactly how fucking good I was.

31:51.767 --> 31:55.333
Sam gave me a one-on-one lesson
which I got very comfortable
with.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.667
I was fuming.

31:56.733 --> 31:59.900
What else happened?
Chloe still doesn't trust Sam.

31:59.967 --> 32:02.900
Do you wanna see how much
you trust each other?

32:02.967 --> 32:04.300
We need a mattress.

32:04.367 --> 32:08.600
I've got the perfect idea to see
if Sam and Chloe trust each
other.

32:08.667 --> 32:11.667
Don't get the pissy one!
Aaron has the mattress.

32:11.733 --> 32:14.733
I hope he doesn't
expect me and Sam to shag.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.533
Chloe, you fall back.
Me first!

32:16.600 --> 32:18.567
Sam. Head forward.

32:18.633 --> 32:20.900
All right.

32:20.967 --> 32:22.133
Sam, switch places.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.767
Right, I've done my bit and
proved
again that Chloe should trust
us.

32:25.833 --> 32:27.233
Now, Chloe's turn.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.133
One, two, three!

32:30.733 --> 32:33.433
(laughter)

32:33.500 --> 32:36.467
Chloe, you are so predictable.

32:36.533 --> 32:38.533
I could see that coming a mile
off.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.233
Thank you very much, Aaron.
You didn't trust him.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.933
I feel like the trust is back.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.367
Let's get ready for tonight!

32:45.433 --> 32:47.500
(cheering)

32:47.567 --> 32:50.533
Buh-Oh-Ruh-Ruh-Rah. Borough.
That how you spell it?

32:58.700 --> 33:00.133
What the fuck?

33:00.200 --> 33:02.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:04.933 --> 33:05.133
.

33:07.667 --> 33:07.867
.

33:20.633 --> 33:22.300
I'm home!

33:22.367 --> 33:24.967
I've been helping my dad out
at work all day,

33:25.033 --> 33:27.333
so I can't come back
emptyhanded.

33:27.400 --> 33:31.167
One for the boys, one for the
girls.
One for the boys, one for the
girls.

33:33.700 --> 33:37.067
We're getting ready and I've got
a surprise for everyone.

33:37.133 --> 33:39.067
Where we going?
My neck of the woods.

33:39.133 --> 33:41.267
Fucking Borough?
Fucking Borough.

33:41.333 --> 33:44.167
Why? What's Borough like?
Riff-raff.

33:44.233 --> 33:46.733
They're not gonna know
what's hit them.

33:47.933 --> 33:50.700
Ooh. Ooh.
Just forgot I've got no knickers
on.

33:51.700 --> 33:54.967
Lads! Come on!
Shut up!

33:55.033 --> 33:57.100
Hiya, lads?
Hello, ladies.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.300
All excited for the Borough?

33:59.367 --> 34:01.933
Tonight is denim jacket night.
Is it?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.167
Oh, my God!

34:04.233 --> 34:05.800
Cheers. Top night.

34:05.867 --> 34:07.367
(cheering)

34:07.433 --> 34:09.632
Short but sweet.

34:09.699 --> 34:13.467
Buh-Oh-Ruh-Ruh-Rah.
Borough. Borough.

34:13.533 --> 34:17.300
Buh-Oh-Ruh-Ruh-Rah. Borough.
Is that how you spell it?

34:20.867 --> 34:22.600
Middlesbrough is an hour away.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.933
It's Saturday night.
It better be worth it.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.667
A night in Middlesbrough.
Up the Borough!

34:27.733 --> 34:31.800
Right. Guys, tell us
what happens in Middlesbrough.

34:31.867 --> 34:33.500
On your right is a fight.

34:33.567 --> 34:36.400
And in the front
is Abbie shagging another lad.

34:36.467 --> 34:37.967
(all) Whey!

34:46.467 --> 34:50.699
We've got to Soho and
surprisingly
it's actually a wicked night.

34:54.533 --> 34:57.100
I feel it could be better
than Newcastle.

34:57.167 --> 35:00.400
Who am I kidding?
There's no place like the Toon.

35:13.867 --> 35:17.200
Chloe might trust me,
but she dropped me on that
mattress.

35:17.267 --> 35:20.567
Let's enjoy our night. I can
sense
it's gonna be a good night.

35:37.767 --> 35:40.367
I'm telling Chloe what Abbie
had to say to us today

35:40.433 --> 35:42.200
cos she does have a right to
know.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.167
Chloe doesn't look very happy.

35:53.467 --> 35:57.000
I don't know what to think, cos
me
and Sam are getting on so well.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.067
It fucks my head
over and over again.

36:10.567 --> 36:14.000
Chloe does not look happy.
I won't lie, I've got the fear.

36:14.067 --> 36:16.667
But the problem is,
I don't know what I've done.

36:32.933 --> 36:35.100
I'm not sure
if what I'm hearing is true,

36:35.167 --> 36:37.600
but it's only fair
Sam knows what's going on.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.633
I don't think he's going to like
it.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.267
I am fucking fuming.

36:57.700 --> 37:01.767
I thought me and Abbie were
good.
Why on earth is she chatting
shit?

37:14.733 --> 37:16.800
I don't know where
Steph got that from.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.567
She's meant to be my mate and
she's
going behind my back, talking
shit.

37:32.267 --> 37:33.600
I believe Abbie.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.233
Steph's either bullshitting,
mortal or both.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.867
But right now, I don't care.

37:37.933 --> 37:40.933
I'm not gonna kick off,
cos I 100% trust Sam now.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
No-one is gonna
get in the way of that.

37:47.367 --> 37:49.167
So that's one problem solved.

37:49.233 --> 37:51.567
Now time to deal with another.
Steph.

38:04.233 --> 38:08.100
I can't believe this is blowing
up
and Abbie's calling me a liar.

38:08.167 --> 38:10.667
That's what I thought Abbie told
us.

38:30.667 --> 38:33.800
What the fuck? Has Steph
actually just pushed us?

38:43.500 --> 38:45.300
I'm watching them
go at each other

38:45.367 --> 38:47.633
and I have no idea
who's telling the truth.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.067
Chloe doesn't look bothered,
but I'm livid.

39:10.333 --> 39:14.500
I'm annoyed people are still
sticking
their noses into our business.

39:14.567 --> 39:18.633
I'm so happy Chloe hasn't
listened.
It shows the trust is there now.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.500
Once again, a good night
ruined by jealous people.

39:22.567 --> 39:24.900
Get me back,
cos I'm going straight to bed.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.567
I'm stuck!

39:32.633 --> 39:34.100
Stuck!

39:34.167 --> 39:36.400
My bag's stuck to my dress.

39:36.467 --> 39:37.700
It's stuck.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.267
Chicken nugget.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.300
More food.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.700
I'll be honest,
I think the Borough was...

39:47.767 --> 39:49.667
Shit!
No, it was nice.

39:49.733 --> 39:51.900
I think it was a good night.
Told yous.

39:51.967 --> 39:53.300
It's fucking mint.

39:53.367 --> 39:56.267
I'm chuffed everyone loved
going out in my hometown,

39:56.333 --> 39:57.933
but I'm glad to be home again.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.967
I'm more glad Chloe hasn't
kicked off about all the shit

40:01.033 --> 40:04.167
Steph and Abbie have said.
She's too busy being wasted.

40:07.900 --> 40:12.100
Hello? Hello, is that Anna?
Fucking Banana.

40:12.167 --> 40:16.267
What the fuck? I think it's
Anna,
but I can't hear. It's a bad
line.

40:16.333 --> 40:18.767
Hello, I've got a job for you
cunts.

40:18.833 --> 40:19.967
Fuck off, Anna.

40:20.033 --> 40:23.467
Excuse me, excuse me.
My boyfriend.

40:23.533 --> 40:26.033
Boyfriend?
I can't believe what I'm
hearing.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.600
Yesterday she was dropping
the L bomb.

40:28.667 --> 40:30.867
Today she's calling me
her boyfriend.

40:30.933 --> 40:33.833
I guess it means
I'm getting some tonight. Get
in!

40:33.900 --> 40:37.867
It's been a pleasure,
but we've got business to attend
to.

40:37.933 --> 40:41.167
(indistinct)

40:41.233 --> 40:44.367
We're going to the Shag Pad
and ending the night with a
bang.

40:44.433 --> 40:46.600
Abbie, how do you feel?

40:46.667 --> 40:49.333
I have had enough of this shit.
I'm going to bed.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.267
I definitely do not want
to be around Steph.

40:52.333 --> 40:56.400
I wanna know why you
were actually gonna chin Abbie.

40:56.467 --> 40:59.133
Now Abbie's finally going to
give
her vag 40 winks,

40:59.200 --> 41:03.233
we can finally get down to
business.
What were they bitching about?

41:03.300 --> 41:04.500
What's been said?

41:04.567 --> 41:09.367
Basically, she thinks
that Sam might upset Chloe
again,

41:09.433 --> 41:11.400
and I wanted Chloe to know that.

41:11.467 --> 41:16.133
But the whole situation
has just gotten out of hand.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.367
I can't believe
me looking out for Chloe

41:18.433 --> 41:21.767
has ended up me and Abbie
not talking and her losing her
shit.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.200
Time to go to bed.

41:23.267 --> 41:26.833
Hopefully in the morning,
this will all be one fucked-up
dream.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.300
If she wants to be a woman about
it,
we'll do it in the morning.

41:30.367 --> 41:33.700
If she wants to be a girl,
I'll sort it now. I'm not arsed.

41:33.767 --> 41:36.633
I've no idea who's lying
and who's telling the truth.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.667
We're all fucked.
I wanna get to bed.

41:38.733 --> 41:42.233
Nathan, why haven't you
got any pants on? Why?

41:42.300 --> 41:45.900
Just as we're heading to bed I
see
something I did not want to see.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.333
(laughter)

42:12.300 --> 42:15.233
As I say, Sam, I wouldn't
kick you out of bed for farting,

42:15.300 --> 42:17.000
I'd just kick you out of bed.

42:21.667 --> 42:23.667
(laughs)

42:25.067 --> 42:27.800
Is Chloe talking about
her vagina as a beast?

42:27.867 --> 42:29.600
It's a bit of a turn off.

42:29.667 --> 42:32.233
I feel like... Are you
playing with yourself?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.967
No.
I can tell by your face.

42:35.033 --> 42:38.633
If you don't hurry up,
I'll have to tame the beast
myself.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.933
Chloe's vagina
is anything but a beast.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.400
But she is an animal and I love
it.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.767
(laughs) Chloe, man!

42:53.833 --> 42:55.733
Last night, bitches!

42:55.800 --> 42:57.033
My fanny's hurting.

42:57.100 --> 43:00.000
I hold my hands up,
I'm in the wrong. I'm sorry.

43:00.067 --> 43:02.467
I regret fighting
with Abbie last night.

43:02.533 --> 43:04.033
I've got a question to ask.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.900
Oh, my God, what is it?

43:07.067 --> 43:09.633
Aaron, do you love Marnie?
Yes.

43:09.700 --> 43:13.067
Aaron just openly admitted
that he loves Marnie.

43:13.133 --> 43:15.533
Surprise, motherfuckers!

43:16.867 --> 43:20.700
I can't even see, let alone
stand
with all this food in my face.

43:26.667 --> 43:29.967
This has gone from being a food
fight to a homoerotic fantasy.

43:57.433 --> 43:57.633
.
