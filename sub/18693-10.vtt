00:06.110 --> 00:07.466
[Simon] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

00:07.490 --> 00:09.330
[Cleophas] <i>If ever demons
overtook the world...</i>

00:10.410 --> 00:14.710
As a last resort, the Soul-Sword would
destroy every Downworlder in its path.

00:14.790 --> 00:16.129
[Clary] <i>The angel Ithuriel.</i>

00:16.200 --> 00:18.990
<i>Valentine was going to use him
to activate the Soul-Sword.</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:21.580
Clary may have a blood
connection to that angel.

00:21.670 --> 00:22.976
Clary can activate
the Soul-Sword.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.330
[grunts]

00:24.420 --> 00:26.566
If killing Clary is the price,
then I'm willing to pay it.

00:26.590 --> 00:28.276
[Luke] <i>Who else knows
what she's capable of?</i>

00:28.300 --> 00:30.350
- [growling]
- [Luke] Meliorn.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.140
Execute Clary
Fairchild on sight.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.230
- Care to rethink that?
- This counsel is biased.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.520
You've been seeing
Isabelle, haven't you?

00:38.180 --> 00:40.060
- [yells]
- Something weird's going on, Alec.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.416
We have reports of violent
Downworlders all over Manhattan.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.200
<i>Aldertree dispatched every Shadowhunter
we have to stop the attacks.</i>

00:45.270 --> 00:47.230
Well, undispatch them.
I think it's Valentine.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.830
If you help me,
I promise to help you find your nana.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.160
Clary, run!

00:55.830 --> 00:57.250
Sweetheart, it's time to go.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.090
- I'll see you soon, Clarissa.
- Simon, no!

01:04.500 --> 01:06.540
[alarm blaring]

01:09.550 --> 01:11.156
[Aldertree] I thought
these wards were airtight.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.986
- How many soldiers are here?
- Only two dozen.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.946
Everyone else is out dealing
with the Downworld attacks.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.220
- I'll take the entry with Longford.
- We'll cover the weapons room.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.980
- Valentine's work?
- Only one way to find out.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.490
Hold your fire.

01:31.530 --> 01:33.620
What's a little girl
doing here all alone?

01:33.700 --> 01:35.450
She's a warlock.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.490
Madzie...

01:39.950 --> 01:41.240
did you...

01:46.790 --> 01:48.960
Hold your fire. She's a kid.

01:53.090 --> 01:54.670
[all choking]

01:58.850 --> 02:00.600
[grunts and pants]

02:05.270 --> 02:06.930
[all gasping]

02:09.440 --> 02:11.360
Madzie! [Grunts]

02:18.910 --> 02:21.160
Who is my favorite
little warlock?

02:24.500 --> 02:25.556
[Jace] Clary, we can't panic.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.660
[Clary] He's a psychopath.
He's capable of anything.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.710
[breathes heavily] Simon
is innocent in all of this.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.220
The only reason Valentine took him
captive is because I care about him.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.390
[footsteps approaching]

02:37.470 --> 02:40.560
Hey. All the prisoners
are either dead or gone.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.730
No sign of Cleophas.

02:42.810 --> 02:45.070
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.560
[cell phone ringing]

02:52.990 --> 02:54.200
Answer it, Clary.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.700
- [muffled grunting]
- No.

02:58.780 --> 02:59.990
<i>Hello, Clarissa.</i>

03:00.910 --> 03:03.096
<i>I wish we were chatting under
more civilized circumstances,</i>

03:03.120 --> 03:05.160
<i>but I'm afraid I've
run out of options.</i>

03:05.250 --> 03:07.050
- Let Simon go.
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

03:07.120 --> 03:09.290
<i>Just as soon as you come
back to the Institute.</i>

03:09.380 --> 03:11.930
<i>I need you to activate
the Sword for me.</i>

03:12.000 --> 03:15.210
- That is never going to happen.
- Oh, but I think it will.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.600
Because if you don't show
up within the hour...

03:18.550 --> 03:20.220
[muffled grunting]

03:20.300 --> 03:24.260
Your vampire boyfriend here is gonna
die a death I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.130
- [Luke] Clary.
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.420
That's what Valentine wants.

03:56.510 --> 03:57.856
You know that if you
touch that sword,

03:57.880 --> 04:00.340
{\an8}you can destroy the entire
Downworld, including Simon.

04:00.430 --> 04:03.190
{\an8}No, Valentine needs an energy source.
He needs lightning.

04:03.970 --> 04:04.970
He's got it.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.720
Every Institute is powered
by an angelic power core.

04:10.810 --> 04:12.310
{\an8}Alec's not picking up.
Let's move.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.336
Valentine is gonna wish he never laid
a hand on Simon. I'll make sure of it.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.950
Whoa, whoa! You're not going
anywhere near that Institute.

04:18.029 --> 04:19.296
We're taking you to Magnus.
He can protect you.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.150
No, I don't need to be protected.
I need to save Simon.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.426
{\an8}The Downworld knows that you're
the key to activating that Sword.

04:24.450 --> 04:25.450
{\an8}They want you dead.

04:25.540 --> 04:28.130
{\an8}-I can save Simon.
- Doesn't work that way.

04:28.210 --> 04:30.920
{\an8}If I'm not the one who shows
up, Valentine is gonna kill him.

04:33.090 --> 04:34.430
[Dot] Wait.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.310
[Clary] Dot?

04:43.890 --> 04:46.440
There's another way
to destroy the Sword.

04:50.770 --> 04:52.150
[Magnus] There you go.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.310
- You'll start feeling better in no time.
- Thank you.

04:59.030 --> 05:00.740
{\an8}Dot,
tell us everything you know.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.450
{\an8}I heard Valentine
briefing his men.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.670
{\an8}If Jace touches the Sword,
his grip would destroy it.

05:08.750 --> 05:09.880
Me?

05:10.460 --> 05:13.380
Why should we believe a word she says?
It's probably just another trap.

05:13.460 --> 05:16.050
Luke, Clary, you know me.

05:16.130 --> 05:19.220
- You've lied to me before.
- Because of the injections.

05:19.300 --> 05:23.520
But now that he has the warlock girl,
he's cast me aside. I'm myself again.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.970
[scoffs] Good story,
but I've heard better.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.150
{\an8}Wait.
In the vision from Ithuriel,

05:28.220 --> 05:30.680
{\an8}the demon that destroyed
the Sword had a clawed hand.

05:30.770 --> 05:33.030
{\an8}Exactly.
It has nothing to do with you.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.310
{\an8}Perhaps I can lend some insight.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.530
{\an8}Show me this vision.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.250
[speaking Latin]

05:50.830 --> 05:52.210
[demon growling]

05:57.040 --> 05:59.710
- The star in the sky.
- Yeah, I remember.

06:00.880 --> 06:05.050
{\an8}Angels are higher beings.
They communicate through metaphors.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.980
Morgenstern means
"Morning Star,"

06:08.060 --> 06:13.570
as in, "How art thou fallen from
heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning."

06:14.600 --> 06:17.100
{\an8}The vision seems to
be speaking of a...

06:18.400 --> 06:20.450
{\an8}demonic Morgenstern.

06:22.780 --> 06:23.870
Me.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.450
That's why Valentine wanted
me under his control.

06:28.530 --> 06:30.530
{\an8}I can derail his plan.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.990
I can destroy the Soul-Sword.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.160
And destroy yourself
in the process.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.750
No.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.720
[stammers] That's a suicide mission.
No way.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.470
Oh, says the girl who was willing to
die for the Downworld, what, yesterday?

06:44.550 --> 06:46.656
- [Clary sighs]
- She's right, Jace. It's too dangerous.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.770
{\an8}Look,
I'm not gonna touch the Sword.

06:49.350 --> 06:50.986
I'll just get to it
before it's activated,

06:51.010 --> 06:54.180
and bring the Mortal Instrument
back to the Clave, where it belongs.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.690
Trust me.

07:00.940 --> 07:04.570
{\an8}[sighs] Alec just doesn't
know when to leave me alone.

07:04.650 --> 07:05.900
{\an8}He never has.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.030
{\an8}Your brother has nothing to worry
about, Isabelle.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.000
Your happiness,
your well-being...

07:15.330 --> 07:16.700
it's all I care about.

07:21.550 --> 07:24.100
That sounds like
Shadowhunter blood talking.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.000
It's true.

07:30.430 --> 07:34.610
I haven't felt this way about anyone in...
a long, long time.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.040
Kiss me.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.170
It's not like that.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.300
I'm... not like that.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.470
I'm just not interested in sex.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.790
Being a vampire
made you this way?

08:10.260 --> 08:11.340
No.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.440
I've always been like this.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.730
[cell phone ringing]

08:25.030 --> 08:27.160
It's probably just Alec.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.820
{\an8}Could you please turn it off?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.540
[cell phone continues ringing]

08:34.289 --> 08:35.370
[sighs]

08:50.470 --> 08:53.640
Sorry, I just saw the time.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.690
I have a meeting with
the Bronx clan leader.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.940
But don't worry, I'll be back.

09:02.020 --> 09:05.310
{\an8}-Bite for the road?
- No, thanks.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.020
{\an8}I need to keep a clear head.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.580
{\an8}I'll see you soon.

09:31.090 --> 09:32.170
{\an8}[sighs]

09:37.720 --> 09:39.260
Alec, are you okay?

09:39.350 --> 09:41.260
We're under attack.
Major casualties.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.220
Valentine used Madzie
to take down the wards.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.180
<i>- She suffocated everyone.</i>
- Where's Izzy?

09:45.270 --> 09:47.310
- She wasn't here.
<i>- Oh, thank the Angel.</i>

09:47.400 --> 09:49.756
Alec, he's there to use the
power core instead of lightning.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.466
<i>He's got Simon.
He's threatening to kill him</i>

09:51.490 --> 09:53.216
if Clary doesn't come
and activate the Sword.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.290
You have to keep Clary
away from that sword.

09:55.370 --> 09:56.660
<i>Don't worry. She's with Magnus.</i>

09:56.740 --> 09:58.570
Luke and I are
coming for it now.

09:58.660 --> 10:00.570
Just get to the power core.
Shut it down.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.620
<i>That way, no matter who touches the
Sword, it won't turn on.</i>

10:03.710 --> 10:05.300
[grunts]

10:05.380 --> 10:06.970
Alec? Alec?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.460
[grunting]

10:17.720 --> 10:19.220
[Aldertree panting]

10:20.180 --> 10:23.680
That's not bad...
for a diplomat.

10:23.770 --> 10:25.070
[muffled grunting]

10:26.150 --> 10:29.450
Well, it seems Clarissa
needs more incentive.

10:29.530 --> 10:30.530
[grunts]

10:31.530 --> 10:32.740
[panting]

10:32.820 --> 10:33.990
No.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.580
What she needs is a real father.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.540
Look, I've been best
friends with Clary forever.

10:40.620 --> 10:45.380
And the one thing she's always wished
is to be able to know her real dad.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.380
And she's had that chance.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.430
And she found a
homicidal maniac.

10:51.510 --> 10:53.680
She wants nothing
to do with you.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.510
She hates you.

10:57.930 --> 10:58.930
Doesn't that bother you?

10:59.970 --> 11:01.890
Doesn't it make
you wanna change?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.050
For her?

11:04.770 --> 11:06.650
[breathes heavily]

11:25.210 --> 11:26.960
I'm not used to feeling so...

11:30.000 --> 11:31.250
powerless.

11:34.010 --> 11:36.050
- [sighs]
- [cell phone ringing]

11:42.140 --> 11:44.860
Oh, my God! Simon, are you okay?

11:44.930 --> 11:45.996
[Valentine over
phone] <i>Simon's fine.</i>

11:46.020 --> 11:48.940
We've just been
having a nice talk.

11:49.020 --> 11:52.060
You know, he told me your greatest
wish was to get to know your old man.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.770
Which is funny, because it's always
been my wish to get to know my daughter.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.660
And so, I'm here,
and I'm waiting for you.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.240
<i>And frankly, well...</i>

12:04.200 --> 12:06.490
Clarissa,
I'm losing my patience.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.250
[gasps]

12:19.510 --> 12:21.050
[gasps]

12:25.930 --> 12:28.050
<i>The vampire has a
half-hour, maybe 40 minutes,</i>

12:28.140 --> 12:29.390
<i>before he turns to dust.</i>

12:30.310 --> 12:31.390
<i>Come quick, Clarissa.</i>

12:32.560 --> 12:34.230
<i>He needs blood to survive.</i>

12:36.440 --> 12:39.110
- Portal me to the Institute.
- Clary, we can't.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
Now!

12:42.120 --> 12:44.870
[Aldertree] Looks like he's
already tapping the energy supply.

12:44.950 --> 12:47.870
We need to get to that
power core and shut it down.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.910
- It'll be heavily guarded.
- We'll get to it via the rooftop.

12:52.630 --> 12:55.760
Hell if I'm gonna let that bastard
destroy the entire Downworld.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.050
What, suddenly you care
about the Downworld?

12:59.130 --> 13:00.380
I'm an officer of the Clave,

13:00.470 --> 13:02.680
sworn to protect Downworlders
and mundanes alike.

13:03.300 --> 13:06.010
- Right.
- I'm not the big bad wolf you think I am.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.310
No, you're worse.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.826
You got my sister
hooked on <i>yin fen.</i>

13:08.850 --> 13:11.810
I warned her, Alec.
Told her of the risks.

13:11.900 --> 13:15.280
But she wanted to visit the Citadel.
The <i>yin fen</i> allowed her to do that.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.070
- I was doing her a favor.
- Are you kidding me?

13:19.190 --> 13:21.530
Look, you might've
helped me back there,

13:21.610 --> 13:23.650
but don't pretend you're
one of the good guys.

13:28.410 --> 13:29.490
[tires screeching]

13:29.580 --> 13:31.266
[Jace] You're a cop.
Can't you drive any faster?

13:31.290 --> 13:33.050
- You wanna drive?
- I'm sorry.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.670
I... I just...
[sighs] I have to get to Alec.

13:36.750 --> 13:40.290
I know what you're going through.
I had a <i>parabatai</i> once.

13:42.090 --> 13:45.880
When Valentine turned on you,
that must've been unbearable.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.010
It was.

13:48.010 --> 13:49.930
I felt like my life was over.

13:50.020 --> 13:52.690
But, over time, I got past it.

13:54.690 --> 13:56.280
Alec's gonna be okay.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.560
He has to be.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.400
- [tires screech]
- [both grunt]

14:05.370 --> 14:07.160
What the hell is she doing here?

14:09.290 --> 14:10.580
[both grunt]

14:10.660 --> 14:13.450
- You locked me up in the dark?
- Where did you come from?

14:13.540 --> 14:16.226
I was watching, waiting for my chance.
But I couldn't wait any longer.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.620
Jace, put the blade away.
This is between me and Maia.

14:18.710 --> 14:20.330
Are you sure?
She's out of control.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.840
So true.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.380
- [grunts]
- [Luke grunts]

14:23.470 --> 14:25.060
Let go! Get off of me!

14:25.140 --> 14:26.500
No, Maia,
put this in perspective.

14:26.550 --> 14:28.550
The fate of the entire
Downworld is at stake.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.860
Who's lost perspective? Who protects
Shadowhunters over their own pack?

14:31.930 --> 14:33.180
[both grunt]

14:34.100 --> 14:35.180
[bones cracking]

14:37.900 --> 14:39.400
- [stun gun surging]
- [groans]

14:41.070 --> 14:43.450
She won't be down for long.
Help me get her in the car.

14:43.530 --> 14:46.426
- No. We have to get back to the Institute.
- I can't just leave her here.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.330
- What do we do if she wolfs out again?
- That's what the stun gun's for.

14:52.410 --> 14:54.200
[breathing heavily]

15:07.550 --> 15:09.300
[cell phone vibrating]

15:24.780 --> 15:27.120
Well, here we are.

15:28.030 --> 15:29.030
[Clary] Magnus...

15:30.030 --> 15:32.700
I want you to know I'm not
going anywhere near that sword.

15:32.790 --> 15:35.710
I don't care what happens to
me, Clary.

15:35.790 --> 15:39.460
Alec's gonna be okay.
Simon's gonna be okay.

15:40.710 --> 15:43.540
We can do this. You and me.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.260
[grunts] Let go of my hands!

15:52.350 --> 15:53.826
So you can use your
magic against us?

15:53.850 --> 15:55.020
I'm sorry, Magnus.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.060
- None of us wanted it to come to this.
- [grunts]

15:57.100 --> 15:59.680
No. I'm here to save Simon.
I'm not going to touch the Sword.

15:59.770 --> 16:02.060
- No, you're not.
- Stop this. Stop it now!

16:02.150 --> 16:05.450
If I don't do it, more Downworlders
are on their way to do it for me.

16:05.530 --> 16:06.870
You're too close to her, Magnus.

16:06.950 --> 16:09.630
- Raphael, you don't have to do this.
- It'll be quick and painless.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.830
- [snarls]
- [gasps]

16:14.790 --> 16:16.080
This ends now.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.990
- [growling]
- Listen up!

16:18.080 --> 16:20.160
[Maia] You'd better be
right about this, Luke.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.570
Clary may be able to activate the
Sword, but I can destroy it.

16:23.630 --> 16:25.890
The angel Ithuriel
confirmed that in a vision.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.590
Angel? Impossible.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.300
I saw it, too.
He's telling the truth.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.970
You kill Clary,
Valentine still has the damn Sword.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.680
Over time, no doubt,
he'll find a way to activate it.

16:35.350 --> 16:39.020
Now is our chance to destroy that
sword for good. Why not let Jace try?

16:39.100 --> 16:41.270
Why would a Shadowhunter
risk his life for us?

16:41.350 --> 16:43.980
Because you and Raphael are
gonna tell your Downworld buddies

16:44.070 --> 16:45.610
not to lay a hand on Clary.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.020
That's the deal.

16:47.110 --> 16:49.020
- And they'll listen to me?
- Maybe.

16:49.110 --> 16:51.990
You're the leader of the most powerful
vampire clan in all of New York.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.030
They respect you.

16:55.450 --> 16:56.570
[sighs]

17:03.960 --> 17:05.750
What exactly is your plan?

17:07.710 --> 17:09.040
[wheezing] Clary.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.800
She'll know it's a trap.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.900
Even the sly mouse will walk into a trap
if it wants the cheese badly enough.

17:18.730 --> 17:21.319
And you, my friend,
you're the cheese.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.150
Hey! Hi.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.210
[clicks tongue] Oh,
don't worry, little one.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.410
It's only a game.
It's make believe, okay?

17:38.490 --> 17:39.830
Take her upstairs.

17:39.910 --> 17:41.830
And don't let anyone in
unless her name is Clary.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.420
[Simon grunting]

17:48.090 --> 17:49.810
[Alec] The power core's
up here on the roof,

17:49.840 --> 17:50.920
behind this access hatch.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.880
Unfortunately,
it's impervious to the unlock rune.

17:56.970 --> 17:59.616
You're the head of the Institute.
You telling me you don't have a key?

17:59.640 --> 18:03.140
- I do, in my office.
- Where Valentine is.

18:03.230 --> 18:05.320
I'll have to override
the control mechanism.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.990
- That's impossible.
- [chuckles]

18:07.070 --> 18:10.530
Not when you have my security clearance,
and know the backdoor algorithms.

18:12.860 --> 18:15.610
I think you wouldn't mind if
the Downworld was destroyed.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.830
Certainly make your job easier.

18:17.910 --> 18:21.290
My relationship to the Downworld
is more complicated than you think.

18:21.370 --> 18:22.450
How's that?

18:24.670 --> 18:25.840
[sighs]

18:26.670 --> 18:30.300
Years ago, when I was still making my
way up through the ranks of the Clave...

18:31.210 --> 18:33.340
[sighs] I fell in
love with a woman.

18:34.550 --> 18:37.550
Beautiful and intelligent. Sexy.

18:38.390 --> 18:39.810
And a lycanthrope.

18:40.890 --> 18:44.060
- You fell in love with a Downworlder?
- Seems odd, doesn't it?

18:44.140 --> 18:46.430
But Eva was special.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.900
After a year together,
I was called to Alicante for a summit.

18:50.650 --> 18:56.190
When I returned, I went to see her
and found the aftermath of a massacre.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.660
A Shax demon.

18:59.950 --> 19:01.950
I discovered Eva
hiding in the basement.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.160
She was in shock,
driven mad by grief.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.750
She couldn't control herself...
so she transformed.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.970
And attacked me.

19:18.340 --> 19:20.880
She'd have killed me if I
hadn't used my seraph blade.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.980
Eva died in my arms.

19:27.270 --> 19:28.680
You killed her.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.150
I had no choice.

19:32.150 --> 19:34.560
Eva couldn't control herself.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.780
That was her nature.
Her wolf nature.

19:41.870 --> 19:45.170
That's when I realized a Shadowhunter
could never be with a Downworlder,

19:46.040 --> 19:48.670
no matter how strong
our feelings might be.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.090
Tell Valentine I'm here.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.520
Hello, my dear.

20:04.680 --> 20:08.810
Where's Simon? Before I do
anything, I need to know he's alive.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.900
I'm afraid you may
have waited too long.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.200
Where is he?

20:18.570 --> 20:22.860
You made the right decision, joining us.
We need to be united now more than ever.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.540
Just to be clear,
I'm doing this for the pack. Not for you.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.410
You think I wanted
to do that to you?

20:29.460 --> 20:32.420
When the pack had no other
options, you chose Clary over us.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.920
But we did have other options.

20:35.260 --> 20:39.760
Jace's plan is gonna work, Maia.
If we stick together, it will work.

20:40.890 --> 20:42.600
Do you really believe that?

20:52.230 --> 20:54.770
Meliorn. I'm glad you're
fighting beside us.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.740
It is my honor.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.910
Though if you are mistaken,
which I fear you might be,

20:59.990 --> 21:01.200
I will never forgive you.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.290
Appreciate the confidence.

21:07.450 --> 21:10.056
Thanks for bringing the pack.
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.370
I'm not gonna lie.
It took some convincing.

21:12.460 --> 21:14.510
Some of them aren't
too keen on this idea.

21:15.550 --> 21:18.590
- Neither am I, to be honest.
- Then why are you here?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.170
I trust you.

21:32.150 --> 21:34.900
Simon. Hold on, okay?

21:37.900 --> 21:39.520
Stay with me, Simon.

21:41.910 --> 21:43.700
Simon, please.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.280
Come on, come on, Simon.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.460
Simon, drink.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.340
- [grunts]
- [Clary] Come on.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.220
It's okay, feed.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.390
Careful, Clarissa.

22:02.590 --> 22:04.550
[gasping]

22:14.270 --> 22:15.520
He's drinking too much.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.400
Stop him. Stop him!

22:25.490 --> 22:27.200
[Simon panting]

22:40.880 --> 22:44.170
On the video call,
Simon was in Aldertree's office. This way.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.060
Careful, Clary.
Circle members could be anywhere.

22:48.930 --> 22:50.400
[Clary] It's Madzie.

22:53.230 --> 22:55.530
Go get her. I'll find Simon.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.600
- Are you sure?
- She's being used, Magnus.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.610
None of this is her fault,
but she needs to be stopped.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.620
- I'll meet you in Aldertree's office.
- Okay.

23:28.970 --> 23:29.980
Hello, sweet pea.

23:33.770 --> 23:34.900
I'm Magnus.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.500
I know you're scared.

23:51.330 --> 23:52.710
You don't have to be.

23:55.080 --> 24:00.250
See... I'm just like you, Madzie.
I'm a warlock, too.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.920
These men are using
you for your abilities.

24:08.930 --> 24:11.020
He said Nana was here.

24:12.260 --> 24:13.720
He lied.

24:16.730 --> 24:17.900
I wanna help you, Madzie.

24:21.150 --> 24:22.360
For real.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.740
Shape-shifting, huh?

24:35.910 --> 24:38.410
- Well, that's original.
- I learned from the best.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.510
No, you didn't.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.660
I would never willingly let
a vampire taste my blood.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.290
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- I saved a life.

24:46.380 --> 24:48.000
A monster's life.

24:48.590 --> 24:49.590
And for what?

24:50.680 --> 24:53.520
He's just gonna die with the
rest of the Downworld anyway.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.980
[grunting]

25:09.650 --> 25:12.490
Here! We have to destroy the Sword.
Come on.

25:12.570 --> 25:15.110
- Nice moves back there.
- Thanks, I've been practicing.

25:23.540 --> 25:24.910
[sighs]

25:32.090 --> 25:34.550
[grunting]

25:39.520 --> 25:40.980
[grunting]

25:44.230 --> 25:46.350
[grunts] Hey, let go!

25:47.190 --> 25:48.190
Let go!

25:51.360 --> 25:52.570
[Aldertree sighs]

25:53.360 --> 25:54.400
It's not working.

25:54.490 --> 25:57.660
The bypass must not apply
to exterior access points.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.460
Four against two.

26:09.510 --> 26:10.550
Could be worse.

26:12.050 --> 26:14.720
- [choking]
- Izzy!

26:16.600 --> 26:18.390
[grunting]

26:28.650 --> 26:30.160
[grunts and pants]

26:36.950 --> 26:38.910
[Alec] Izzy, are you okay?

26:40.410 --> 26:41.450
[Isabelle groans softly]

26:41.540 --> 26:44.250
I got you. You okay?

26:44.330 --> 26:45.750
I'm so sorry, Alec.

26:46.670 --> 26:47.840
For what, saving our lives?

27:00.350 --> 27:03.730
Hey, about, you know,
what happened back there...

27:03.810 --> 27:05.610
I've heard of blood thirst,

27:05.690 --> 27:07.780
even felt it, but...

27:07.860 --> 27:09.400
never that badly.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.110
Once I started feeding, I couldn't stop.
I'm really sorry.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.900
- Don't apologize.
- I would have killed you.

27:18.910 --> 27:20.290
I would have let you.

27:21.580 --> 27:24.630
But you, like,
rescued me from actual death.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.846
- So, thanks. A lot.
- Hey, you know how you can thank me?

27:26.870 --> 27:28.660
- Shut up.
- Right.

27:31.420 --> 27:34.340
Looks like they have the Sword
tapped into that power thing.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.090
Not for long.

27:37.510 --> 27:38.710
[dialing]

27:40.640 --> 27:41.640
Hey.

27:42.770 --> 27:43.900
You know how to use that?

27:43.970 --> 27:45.290
Yeah, just point and
stab, right?

27:45.350 --> 27:46.810
[breathes deeply]

27:46.890 --> 27:49.520
- Use your vamp speed.
- Obviously.

27:50.650 --> 27:52.910
As soon as we get back
up, we move in.

27:55.530 --> 27:56.700
[Clary grunting]

27:56.780 --> 27:58.580
It might be too late for that.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.710
- [Clary struggling] No! Let me go!
- No.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.860
You can't make me do this.
[Grunts]

28:05.120 --> 28:06.160
I won't do it!

28:06.250 --> 28:08.090
Unfortunately,
you don't get to decide that.

28:08.170 --> 28:11.130
- [grunts]
- I am doing this for you,

28:11.210 --> 28:13.026
and for your brother and
for the rest of humanity.

28:13.050 --> 28:14.340
[grunts]

28:14.420 --> 28:17.090
Clarissa, this planet is under
siege by demon-blooded creatures,

28:17.170 --> 28:18.670
intent on death and destruction.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.680
Once I wield that sword,

28:21.760 --> 28:23.656
the Downworld will no
longer be part of our world.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.760
And the lives of my children...

28:26.680 --> 28:29.100
will be that much safer.

28:30.100 --> 28:32.600
[straining] Let go! Let go!

28:34.480 --> 28:38.070
- No! No! No!
- Clarissa, please.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.480
[breathing heavily]

28:42.490 --> 28:43.860
[Valentine grunts]

28:48.000 --> 28:49.420
[grunts]

28:56.260 --> 28:57.640
[cell phone rings]

28:58.550 --> 28:59.640
Let's move.

29:02.510 --> 29:04.170
- [grunts]
- [groans]

29:04.260 --> 29:06.090
- [Maia] Luke!
- [both grunting]

29:13.650 --> 29:16.990
- Clary, you all right?
- I'm fine. Let's go.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.490
Jace, what...

29:24.910 --> 29:26.580
Jace, what are you doing?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.170
Jace!

29:31.500 --> 29:32.670
Don't.

29:33.420 --> 29:36.050
If you touch the
Sword, it'll kill you.

29:38.090 --> 29:39.850
[cries]

29:39.920 --> 29:41.590
Jace, don't do it!

29:41.680 --> 29:43.100
No, Jace!

29:47.180 --> 29:48.470
[grunts]

29:50.310 --> 29:53.030
- [groans]
- Why didn't that destroy the Sword?

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
I don't know.

29:55.770 --> 29:57.650
- [Clary] Jace, are you okay?
- [grunts]

29:59.150 --> 30:01.020
You're nothing if not
predictable, son.

30:06.370 --> 30:07.370
[all yelling]

30:07.410 --> 30:08.610
[growling]

30:17.250 --> 30:18.830
[Downworlders screaming]

30:43.950 --> 30:44.950
Oh, my God.

30:47.370 --> 30:49.790
- Simon, you're okay.
- How?

30:50.540 --> 30:51.790
[Clary sighs]

30:51.870 --> 30:54.370
Every other Downworlder in
here, they're...

30:54.460 --> 30:55.460
They're all dead.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.380
I don't know.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.000
I just pray the <i>adamas</i> in the
walls contained the blast.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.100
- Where's Valentine?
- [sighs] He's gone.

31:04.170 --> 31:05.760
[gasps]

31:05.840 --> 31:07.170
Jace.

31:08.220 --> 31:09.930
[breathing heavily]

31:11.100 --> 31:12.150
I don't understand.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.640
How did I activate the Sword?

31:15.730 --> 31:18.440
Only someone with pure angel
blood could have done it.

31:22.190 --> 31:24.690
You don't have demon
blood, Jace.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.590
No.

31:39.170 --> 31:40.300
You did this.

31:40.380 --> 31:42.510
- You activated the Sword?
- No.

31:42.590 --> 31:43.760
I did it. [Breathes shakily]

31:44.420 --> 31:46.500
I thought I was destroying
it, Alec, but...

31:48.720 --> 31:50.230
Where's Magnus?

31:51.430 --> 31:53.840
- He wasn't here, was he?
- I... I don't know.

31:53.930 --> 31:57.220
We Portaled in upstairs.
We split up. I...

31:59.860 --> 32:02.490
- Oh, God.
- Alec.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.500
[Maia] <i>It was all a con.</i>

32:18.500 --> 32:20.630
- He lied to us.
- You don't know that.

32:21.210 --> 32:25.000
Alaric, Taito...
Half of our pack must be dead.

32:25.090 --> 32:26.300
Jace led us into a trap.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.500
He wouldn't do that.
It had to have been Valentine.

32:28.590 --> 32:30.486
Well, he has the Sword now,
which means he could do it again.

32:30.510 --> 32:31.840
I'm taking him down.

32:31.930 --> 32:35.610
Maia, the pack needs you.
Go back to the Jade Wolf.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.156
Keep what's left of
the pack indoors.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.970
Take them underground.
I'll deal with Valentine.

32:48.450 --> 32:50.490
- [growling]
- [Valentine groans]

32:51.780 --> 32:52.990
[whimpers]

32:53.910 --> 32:55.540
[breathing heavily]

32:55.620 --> 32:56.620
[grunts]

32:56.700 --> 32:58.490
[bones cracking]

33:00.750 --> 33:03.210
[groaning]

33:04.880 --> 33:06.550
[panting]

33:06.630 --> 33:08.540
My <i>parabatai.</i> [panting]

33:09.130 --> 33:13.170
If only you had stuck with me, maybe
things would have turned out differently.

33:13.260 --> 33:14.680
[groaning]

33:15.850 --> 33:18.810
I always thought this
moment would bring me joy...

33:19.810 --> 33:21.140
but I was wrong.

33:23.810 --> 33:25.140
[both grunting]

33:29.320 --> 33:30.990
[grunts] Liar!

33:31.070 --> 33:33.110
You told me I had demon blood.
Why?

33:33.200 --> 33:36.540
Because that's how you are.
Always ready to right the wrong,

33:36.620 --> 33:39.540
to stand up for those who
can't stand up for themselves.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.120
A real-life hero.

33:42.330 --> 33:45.080
- So, you used me.
- I just made sure Dot overheard me.

33:45.170 --> 33:48.760
That's why I left her behind,
so you would come to save the day.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.810
And activate the Sword instead.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.510
You didn't inject me with demon blood.
It was angel blood.

33:53.590 --> 33:56.470
You are my greatest
achievement, Jace.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.480
I'm not your achievement.
I'm your son.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.900
No, you are not my son.

34:02.980 --> 34:05.950
I'm not your father.
Jocelyn is not your mother.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.600
And Clary...

34:07.690 --> 34:09.940
Clary is not your sister.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.989
- More lies.
- Don't I wish.

34:13.070 --> 34:15.030
Truth sword, remember?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.330
[both grunting]

34:41.679 --> 34:42.850
Please let this work.

35:03.290 --> 35:04.880
[grunts]

35:06.580 --> 35:07.830
[both grunting]

35:17.800 --> 35:19.220
- Jace! Don't!
- [grunts]

35:19.300 --> 35:21.050
The Mortal Cup is
still out there.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.740
He's the only one who
knows where it is.

35:28.110 --> 35:31.160
You're gonna wish you were dead after
the Clave gets through with you.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.230
Jace...

35:34.400 --> 35:35.940
the Sword's gone.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.470
[Aldertree] A sight to see.

35:57.550 --> 36:00.170
Valentine Morgenstern in
the custody of the Clave,

36:00.260 --> 36:02.470
where you will rot for
your remaining days.

36:03.430 --> 36:05.010
Where is the Soul-Sword?

36:05.980 --> 36:08.190
- I have no idea.
- [scoffs]

36:09.150 --> 36:14.360
Our interrogation techniques have...
improved since you were one of us.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.820
You can torture me all you want.
I don't know where it is.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.860
Don't believe a word he says.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.540
What else have you lied about?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.840
[inhales sharply] One
thing I didn't lie about...

36:30.580 --> 36:32.080
is my love for you, Jace.

36:47.810 --> 36:49.600
[panting]

37:00.990 --> 37:03.280
- Magnus, I thought...
- I found Madzie.

37:03.370 --> 37:06.750
I got her out just in time.
I took her to Catarina's. She's safe.

37:07.790 --> 37:08.790
Look...

37:10.250 --> 37:11.930
Magnus, on every mission
I've ever been on,

37:11.960 --> 37:14.800
I've never felt that type of
fear, ever.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.340
Not knowing if you were
alive or dead. I...

37:20.300 --> 37:21.460
I was terrified.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.390
So was I.

37:26.390 --> 37:27.510
[panting] Magnus, I...

37:29.770 --> 37:30.940
I love you.

37:34.730 --> 37:35.940
I love you, too.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.320
[Simon] Alaric.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.440
Oh, man.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.360
You didn't make
things easy on me...

38:25.370 --> 38:27.250
but you didn't deserve this.

38:42.010 --> 38:43.180
[gasps]

38:52.560 --> 38:54.020
What the hell?

39:12.200 --> 39:13.450
[Raphael] Isabelle.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.380
[sighs] You're alive.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.260
I sped out just in time.

39:26.090 --> 39:29.050
I've come to gather
what's left of my clan...

39:29.140 --> 39:30.850
and see if you needed anything.

39:32.310 --> 39:33.520
No.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.930
- Isabelle, please. I can explain...
- No, you can't.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.530
I don't want anything
from you ever again.

39:52.410 --> 39:57.080
- How do you know it was the truth?
- He had the Soul-Sword in his hands.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.330
So...

40:02.250 --> 40:04.630
Clary's not your sister?

40:06.130 --> 40:08.210
No, she never was.

40:08.930 --> 40:11.730
[scoffs] What are you gonna do?

40:14.850 --> 40:16.070
[sighs]

40:18.440 --> 40:19.980
I'm gonna tell her.

40:29.660 --> 40:30.660
Luke.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.710
Tell me we got him.

40:34.620 --> 40:35.630
[softly] Yeah.

40:38.460 --> 40:39.840
How are you feeling?

40:41.880 --> 40:45.720
Better now that you're okay,
and Valentine's locked up.

40:48.050 --> 40:50.130
Oh, no. Luke, are you okay?

40:53.810 --> 40:55.730
[Clary] He's been sedated.

40:56.730 --> 40:57.730
Clary...

40:59.100 --> 41:02.140
I know it's not a good time,
but there's something I have to show you.

41:03.770 --> 41:06.650
- Simon, will you tell me what's going on?
- It's a surprise.

41:06.740 --> 41:09.490
[Clary] What are you doing?
The sun's up, you can't...

41:09.570 --> 41:10.730
Wait! Simon!

41:11.700 --> 41:12.700
[laughs]

41:12.780 --> 41:15.490
- [laughing] How?
- I mean, does it matter?

41:15.580 --> 41:17.420
- [chuckles]
- [Simon grunts]

41:26.420 --> 41:29.290
[Clary and Simon laughing]
