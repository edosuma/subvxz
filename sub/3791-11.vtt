01:08.027 --> 01:10.487
WHAT ABOUT BOB?

01:18.554 --> 01:20.777
What do you think...
Five-button Dolce too edgy

01:20.843 --> 01:22.128
or just right?

01:22.188 --> 01:24.721
It depends. You shooting the
pilot or serving finger food?

01:24.811 --> 01:27.044
Don't give me a hard time
today, Turtle, please!

01:28.144 --> 01:31.527
So big day all around.
Everyone excited?

01:31.678 --> 01:33.909
- What are you doing, Vince?
- Can't you tell? Look.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.683
- I'm channeling Joey Ramone.
- Joey didn't play guitar, Vince.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.272
No, that's Johnny, who I'd be
perfect for by the way, Vince.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.449
You know, maybe do a little
brother-brother piece.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.010
They weren't really
related, Drama.

01:43.046 --> 01:45.662
- Like anyone believes these two are.
- What the fuck, Turtle?

01:45.725 --> 01:48.233
I told you I got a big day
today. I don't need this shit!

01:48.326 --> 01:49.691
Easy, Drama,
I'm just playing!

01:49.788 --> 01:52.273
Yo, play with someone who
doesn't have a two-page monologue.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.270
What's the matter, Johnny?
You nervous?

01:54.346 --> 01:56.240
I haven't had a real part
in a long time,

01:56.318 --> 01:58.613
and, uh, I got this
big monologue to do.

01:58.677 --> 02:00.111
Maybe you should
take a Xanax.

02:00.178 --> 02:02.373
No, no Xanax.
You can't act on Xanax.

02:02.448 --> 02:05.810
You can't act when you're
having a panic attack either.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.540
Why would you say
"panic attack"?

02:07.616 --> 02:09.541
I haven't had
a panic attack since '95.

02:09.615 --> 02:11.772
I don't need you to go
putting that shit in my head!

02:11.847 --> 02:13.613
Relax, Drama.
You're going to kill it.

02:13.678 --> 02:15.692
You know what I do
when I'm anxious, right?

02:15.788 --> 02:17.770
- No, what?
- I whack off.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.112
Yeah, that's great, Turtle.
I'm gonna whack off.

02:20.187 --> 02:21.971
I'm serious. Will you trust me on this?

02:22.046 --> 02:23.873
A good tug takes
away all your anxiety.

02:23.946 --> 02:27.613
Yeah, so does a good laugh.
Thanks, man. I'm outta here.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.191
- Knock 'em dead, Drama.
- Good luck.

02:30.255 --> 02:31.871
- Thanks, guys.
- I'm gonna roll too.

02:31.947 --> 02:33.812
Heading over to Paramount
with Bob and Ari.

02:33.877 --> 02:35.692
First meeting. Sure
you shouldn't be there?

02:35.757 --> 02:37.860
No, Ari says it's more
mysterious if I don't show.

02:37.927 --> 02:40.031
Besides, I promised Turtle
I'd take him shopping.

02:40.095 --> 02:41.091
For what?

02:41.158 --> 02:43.402
New limited kicks they're
dropping over at Undefeated.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.511
With my Saigon money
burning a hole in my pocket,

02:45.575 --> 02:47.543
I may just have to
buy them all.

02:47.616 --> 02:49.312
Good investment
strategy, Turtle.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.941
- I'll see you guys.
- Go get 'em, E.

02:51.017 --> 02:52.041
This could be a big one.

03:00.318 --> 03:02.070
Ah, the boy wonder.

03:02.146 --> 03:04.041
- Can you smell it?
- Smell what?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.343
Napalm.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.271
"Love the smell
of napalm in the morning.

03:07.346 --> 03:09.081
"It smells like victory."

03:09.148 --> 03:10.950
Glad you sound confident,
Ari. Where's Bob?

03:11.018 --> 03:12.512
I thought you were
gonna call him.

03:12.575 --> 03:14.062
You said you were
gonna call him.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.672
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

03:15.746 --> 03:17.572
But you didn't,
which is why I did.

03:17.645 --> 03:20.940
Eric, you did not. Tell
me you did not call Bob.

03:21.908 --> 03:24.401
We have enough problems with
the studio as it is, all right?

03:24.465 --> 03:27.442
I don't need this old fuck keeling
over right in the middle of my flow.

03:27.515 --> 03:28.563
It's his project, Ari.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.583
That's exactly why
he doesn't need to be here!

03:30.676 --> 03:32.042
- What?
- He's protected.

03:32.118 --> 03:35.172
We get him wet with Vince first,
I guarantee you they will fuck us.

03:35.248 --> 03:38.273
We blow our load with Bob, and we
might not even get our balls tickled.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.612
Ari, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about,

03:40.678 --> 03:42.911
but you're making me
uncomfortable.

03:42.977 --> 03:46.310
What, did he mug Liberace
on the way over here?

03:46.376 --> 03:47.312
Be nice.

03:47.376 --> 03:48.612
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

03:48.678 --> 03:51.040
Did you try to screw me
out of this meeting, Ari?

03:51.115 --> 03:53.312
Are you kidding me? Simple
case of miscommunication.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.772
- Let's not have another one.
- We won't, Bob. I promise.

03:55.848 --> 03:58.640
- Remember who found this project.
- Remember where you found it...

03:58.706 --> 04:00.512
Underneath your pillow.
If it wasn't for me

04:00.577 --> 04:02.942
they wouldn't have uncovered
it until your estate sale.

04:03.018 --> 04:05.040
This thing is hot, Eric. I can feel it.

04:05.117 --> 04:06.810
I'm looking forward
to this meeting.

04:06.875 --> 04:07.841
Me too, Bob.

04:07.918 --> 04:09.371
You think Dawnie
will be there?

04:09.447 --> 04:10.870
Dawnie who?

04:11.948 --> 04:13.642
Dawn Steele, the head
of the studio.

04:13.718 --> 04:16.113
Bob,  Dawn Steele
died nine years ago.

04:16.475 --> 04:18.572
Oh my God,
you're right.

04:18.648 --> 04:20.841
I went to her funeral.

04:24.506 --> 04:25.562
Jeez!

04:27.046 --> 04:29.740
I don't get it. All these
people are on line for sneakers?

04:29.817 --> 04:32.170
Oh yeah. Some of them probably
even camped out all night.

04:32.247 --> 04:34.512
- For sneakers?
- Vince, these ain't just eakers.

04:34.577 --> 04:38.243
- These are limited edition Fukijamas.
- Fuki-what-as?

04:38.317 --> 04:41.371
Oh, Vince. You know sometimes
you're so cultureless.

04:41.446 --> 04:45.042
Fukijama is one of the most famous
graffiti artists in the world.

04:45.117 --> 04:47.412
Every year Nike commissions
him to do a limited drop.

04:47.477 --> 04:49.270
200 pairs this year.

04:49.347 --> 04:52.641
After that he destroys the pattern
and they're never to be made again.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.242
So they're holding
a pair for you?

04:54.316 --> 04:55.743
Nah, they refused
to do so.

04:55.816 --> 04:57.640
But it's an unwritten
law in America:

04:57.716 --> 05:00.210
bring a movie star, go right
to the front of the line.

05:00.277 --> 05:02.770
Turtle, are you nuts? These
people will kill us if we cut.

05:02.818 --> 05:05.192
Nah, they'll be thrilled
just to get a glimpse of you.

05:05.277 --> 05:06.460
I'm not cutting, Turtle.

05:06.518 --> 05:08.671
Way to be a man of the people, Aquaman.

05:08.747 --> 05:11.272
- Vince, these are limited...
- Back of the line, Turtle.

05:11.347 --> 05:13.872
You're lucky I'm
even willing to wait.

05:25.648 --> 05:28.511
Hi, I'm Johnny Chase. I was just
wondering, where do I check in?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.043
Uh, let me see.
We got you...

05:30.117 --> 05:33.143
- Drama!
- Oh, Jesus, Ed!

05:33.217 --> 05:34.170
You okay?

05:34.246 --> 05:36.010
Yeah, you just
startled me a bit.

05:36.075 --> 05:37.711
Cool, cool.
Good to see you.

05:37.777 --> 05:40.772
Jesus, man, your hands feel like
you just got out of the lap pool.

05:40.846 --> 05:42.240
A little nervous?

05:42.318 --> 05:44.670
Nervous? Me? No, no, I'm
not nervous. I feel great.

05:44.748 --> 05:47.273
Good, well, you're gonna
feel even greater in a second

05:47.347 --> 05:49.172
because I just
beefed up your monologue.

05:49.256 --> 05:51.341
You added to my monologue?

05:51.418 --> 05:53.311
Yeah, yeah, just a couple
of paragraphs.

05:53.376 --> 05:56.531
Just think: three minutes,
your face, and a lens.

05:56.646 --> 05:59.073
Every actor's
fantasy, right?

05:59.148 --> 06:00.740
Great, great.

06:01.878 --> 06:02.841
I'm a little nervous.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.511
It's all good, Bob.
Just relax.

06:05.576 --> 06:08.773
It's been a long time since I had
a meeting with so much on the line.

06:08.845 --> 06:11.572
So, what are you thinking
for strategy, Ari?

06:11.648 --> 06:15.411
I'm thinking that I talk
and you guys listen.

06:15.477 --> 06:17.971
Well, I'm a little more
personable than you are.

06:18.047 --> 06:20.111
At if I lead things off
with a joke

06:20.175 --> 06:22.440
or a trick?
I brought a...

06:22.517 --> 06:23.541
a deck of cards.

06:23.618 --> 06:26.742
You  brought cards.
He brought cards.

06:26.816 --> 06:29.543
- I don't think we need cards, Bob.
- Nah.

06:29.617 --> 06:32.472
I'm not comfortable just
not talking, so what then?

06:32.545 --> 06:35.412
Why don't you
play solitaire?

06:35.475 --> 06:37.873
You know what? I don't
like your attitude.

06:37.946 --> 06:39.542
- Gentlemen.
- There he is.

06:39.617 --> 06:41.011
How are you, Brad?

06:41.076 --> 06:43.811
Bradley! Bob Ryan nice to meet you.

06:44.078 --> 06:46.041
I'm the producer,
in case you had to guess.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.513
Of course, yeah. It's a
pleasure. Come on in, guys.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.341
You need anything
to drink... Anything?

06:50.418 --> 06:51.913
I'd love a cup of Sanka.

06:51.977 --> 06:53.542
Sanka, get...
Get him a Sanka.

06:53.616 --> 06:55.743
I hope you brought your
checkbook,

06:55.818 --> 06:58.031
'cause you're gonna want
to buy this one in the room.

06:58.092 --> 06:59.519
Great, tell me about it.

06:59.612 --> 07:01.640
- How do I get there?
- Where do you want to get?

07:01.716 --> 07:03.272
- I want to get there.
- Have a seat.

07:03.346 --> 07:05.713
- But...
- Let him through, Ari, Jesus!

07:07.016 --> 07:09.063
Okay, fellas,
let's get going here.

07:09.127 --> 07:12.050
- We're excited about this one...
- Bradley, what if I was to tell you

07:12.145 --> 07:14.101
that you could make
this picture for nothing,

07:14.195 --> 07:16.573
win an Oscar,
and gross $100 million?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.813
Is that something you
might be interested in?

07:20.348 --> 07:21.841
I think I would, Bob.

07:25.248 --> 07:27.242
- Thanks, Vince.
- Hey, thanks, homes.

07:27.315 --> 07:29.672
- No problem, man.
- Vince Chase, over here!

07:29.745 --> 07:31.372
Come on, guys,
I think you got enough.

07:31.446 --> 07:33.640
- Just a couple more, Vince.
- Hey guys, thanks.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.943
Thanks for your patience.

07:35.015 --> 07:37.443
We got no shot here, Vin,
no shot.

07:37.515 --> 07:39.543
Don't worry. I'm
feeling good about this.

07:39.616 --> 07:43.511
Yo, Turtle, check it
out, man. Last set of 9s.

07:43.577 --> 07:46.142
I'm a 10, dickhead.

07:46.218 --> 07:47.242
Little-ass feet.

07:47.338 --> 07:48.440
Still feeling good?

07:48.547 --> 07:49.952
Yeah, I am.
But I don't get it.

07:50.047 --> 07:52.121
If this was so important,
why didn't you get up

07:52.215 --> 07:54.173
and stand on line like
the rest of these guys?

07:54.238 --> 07:55.860
'Cause I had you,
which is like having

07:55.927 --> 07:58.140
a roll-out-of-bed-late-and-
still-get-the-kicks card.

07:58.218 --> 08:00.842
If you stop with the negativity,
I will get you these sneakers.

08:00.968 --> 08:02.910
- How?
- Will you stop with the negativity?

08:02.975 --> 08:04.910
- Yes.
- Then I will get you the sneakers.

08:04.975 --> 08:07.811
Yo, listen up! The Fuks
are done. We're sold out.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.173
How, Vince, how?

08:10.247 --> 08:13.052
- I'm calling Tracy at Nike.
- Don't think I called her yesterday?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.460
She's got nothing to do
with this. These are limited.

08:15.546 --> 08:17.200
The only way we
could have got them was

08:17.265 --> 08:20.143
- if we cut the fucking line!
- All right, I get it.

08:20.218 --> 08:22.911
Yo, Santa Monica has a few
pairs left. You'd better hurry.

08:22.975 --> 08:24.342
Come  on, Turtle,
let's hit it.

08:24.418 --> 08:26.641
You want to race all these
people to Santa Monica?

08:26.715 --> 08:29.172
If we have to, because we are
getting you those sneakers.

08:29.236 --> 08:31.490
I love the positivity, Vin,
but it ain't gonna happen.

08:31.556 --> 08:33.513
All right. You know
what? Let's not even try.

08:33.575 --> 08:35.472
Aw, fuck that.
We're definitely trying.

08:42.018 --> 08:45.213
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

08:45.276 --> 08:46.712
You are
not a pussy.

08:47.816 --> 08:50.112
We're ready
for you, Johnny.

08:50.177 --> 08:52.712
And I'm ready
for you, baby.

08:56.698 --> 08:58.473
Yeah! Yeah!

09:05.417 --> 09:07.110
There he is! What do you say, Johnny?

09:07.176 --> 09:09.633
Hey, hey, hey! I'm gonna kill
this, man. I'm gonna kill it.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.730
I like the confidence. I want to talk
to you about the blocking, though.

09:12.828 --> 09:14.151
The blocking?
What blocking?

09:14.218 --> 09:15.943
The script says
I'm sitting at a table.

09:16.015 --> 09:17.742
I know, but I came up
with a great shot.

09:17.817 --> 09:19.841
We're gonna do the
whole thing on the move.

09:19.915 --> 09:21.970
On the move? I'm doing
my monologue on the move?

09:22.006 --> 09:24.691
Yeah, yeah, just like this. Just
like life, walking and talking.

09:24.778 --> 09:25.781
It's gonna be beautiful.

09:25.847 --> 09:27.623
I don't know, Eddie.
It's a long speech.

09:27.688 --> 09:30.210
I know, and the guys at the
network don't think we can do it

09:30.278 --> 09:32.312
but I told them
we got the guy that can.

09:35.078 --> 09:36.510
Johnny, yo,
where are you going?

09:36.578 --> 09:38.972
I left the iron on in my
trailer. I'll be right back.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.741
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

09:40.817 --> 09:43.313
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.770
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

09:46.978 --> 09:48.243
I think that went
very well.

09:48.317 --> 09:50.870
Very well?
You lost him at "Sanka."

09:50.946 --> 09:54.213
The man said, and I'm
quoting, "this is not for us."

09:54.275 --> 09:55.870
They didn't want
a biopic.

09:55.948 --> 09:58.571
I have never been turned down
in the room before, never.

09:58.647 --> 10:00.443
It didn't sound like
a turndown to me.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.010
It sounded like he just
needed to hear a little more.

10:03.076 --> 10:06.812
He couldn't hear anything
because you wouldn't stop talking.

10:06.878 --> 10:09.230
What did you expect? I had
to wing it. You had no plan.

10:09.295 --> 10:11.190
I had a plan... for you
to shut the fuck up.

10:11.257 --> 10:13.072
I don't like how he's
speaking to me, Eric.

10:13.148 --> 10:14.691
Don't  speak to him
like that, Ari.

10:14.755 --> 10:16.812
What if I were to tell you
I had a 22-inch cock?

10:16.876 --> 10:18.790
Is that something you
might be interested in?

10:18.856 --> 10:20.840
- Jesus fucking Christ...
- Are you mocking me?

10:20.876 --> 10:22.140
Why would I mock you?

10:22.205 --> 10:24.341
Everyone knows the best way
to close a studio deal

10:24.407 --> 10:26.443
is to pull a quarter
out of the president's ear.

10:26.518 --> 10:29.042
Ari, it's no one's fault.
It just wasn't for them.

10:29.115 --> 10:31.711
E, they have no idea
what's for them.

10:31.777 --> 10:33.810
That's what I do.
I sell.

10:33.878 --> 10:36.241
It's not your project
to sell, Ari.

10:36.317 --> 10:37.910
Vince is my client.
Without Vince,

10:37.978 --> 10:40.970
it's just a bunch of chopped
up trees with words on them.

10:41.047 --> 10:42.700
You sanctimonious
little piece of crap,

10:42.766 --> 10:44.453
I put years of my life
into this script.

10:44.516 --> 10:45.390
Bob, relax.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.412
It's my fucking score, Eric,
and he denigrates.

10:47.477 --> 10:48.730
He has no respect.

10:48.825 --> 10:50.832
I  have 50 years
in this business!

10:50.896 --> 10:52.670
Time was when I'd
walk into the Derby...

10:52.746 --> 10:54.410
they'd kick Coppola
out on his ass

10:54.475 --> 10:55.643
to get me a table!

10:55.718 --> 10:57.673
Time was there was
no sound in movies, Bob.

10:57.748 --> 11:00.171
Ari, let me
handle this.

11:00.246 --> 11:02.333
Bob, I hear you,
and I promise you

11:02.428 --> 11:05.191
you're going to get everything
you want as soon as we set this up.

11:05.255 --> 11:07.402
But Ari does do this every
day, so what do you say

11:07.465 --> 11:10.072
on the next meeting
we let him do his thing?

11:12.676 --> 11:13.663
Okay.

11:14.175 --> 11:16.640
But for you, because you're
a nice boy with kind eyes.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.110
Thanks, Bob.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.010
Okay, Ari,
it's your show.

11:21.078 --> 11:24.373
You call the plays and
I'll provide the color.

11:24.447 --> 11:25.712
No.
No fucking color, Bob.

11:25.777 --> 11:26.812
Tell him no color, E.

11:26.877 --> 11:28.041
Let's skip
the color, Bob.

11:28.115 --> 11:30.443
If things go badly,
then maybe you step in.

11:30.516 --> 11:34.143
Okay, I'll step in
when it's appropriate.

11:34.217 --> 11:35.772
So where to next?

11:35.845 --> 11:37.742
Disney.
Remember Disney, Bob?

11:37.817 --> 11:40.172
- Yes, I remember.
- The big ears, the little mouse?

11:40.278 --> 11:43.013
I screen-tested
Cybill Shepherd there...

11:43.076 --> 11:46.170
Tons of talent,
no underpants.

11:46.256 --> 11:47.771
How 'bout that, huh?
Fantastic.

11:47.846 --> 11:50.373
E, roll with me, we'll save
some gas. I'll drop you off.

11:50.446 --> 11:52.312
Ok. You want to roll with us, Bob?

11:52.378 --> 11:55.841
In that nazi sled?
I don't think so.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.212
All right, well,
I'll see you over there.

12:03.775 --> 12:07.310
Ah, good. It's
ringing... Finally.

12:07.377 --> 12:11.141
Don't matter. They won't
hold 'em, even for celebs.

12:11.217 --> 12:13.643
I'm just telling you
how the system works.

12:13.716 --> 12:16.972
Undefeated, Santa Monica.

12:17.046 --> 12:19.942
Hi, how are you? I'm
Vince Chase. I'm an actor.

12:20.016 --> 12:21.570
<i>You mean Aquaman?</i>

12:21.647 --> 12:23.370
- Yeah.
- Wow, what's up?

12:23.446 --> 12:27.110
Well, I'm kind of desperate for
a size 10 pair of the Fukiyamas...

12:27.175 --> 12:28.872
Fukijamas, Vince.
Fukijamas.

12:28.947 --> 12:31.171
He knows what
I'm talking about.

12:31.247 --> 12:33.751
- Man, I've only got one 11.
- He's got an 11. You want 'em?

12:33.845 --> 12:35.670
- Is he gonna hold 'em?
- Do you want 'em?

12:35.748 --> 12:38.442
Fuck yeah! If he's gonna hold 'em
I'll wear three pairs of socks!

12:38.518 --> 12:41.323
Yeah, listen, I'm on my way down
there. Will you hold them for me?

12:41.418 --> 12:44.470
Actually, I'd love to, but we're
not allowed to hold these for anyone,

12:44.547 --> 12:46.211
<i>even celebrities.</i>

12:46.278 --> 12:48.812
It would really
mean a lot to me.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.141
Tssst, I knew they
wouldn't hold them.

12:52.848 --> 12:55.612
$1500 cash in your
pocket when I arrive.

12:55.677 --> 12:57.041
There you go.

12:57.118 --> 12:58.941
Hey Vince, I can't
take your money, man.

12:59.016 --> 13:02.342
But if this is really you, my sister,
man, she's a huge fan of yours.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.542
<i>If you were to show up
at her birthday party,</i>

13:04.618 --> 13:07.142
<i>take a few pictures with her
and her annoying friends,</i>

13:07.218 --> 13:08.911
<i>man, it would be like
you were family.</i>

13:08.976 --> 13:10.340
<i>I could never
say no to family.</i>

13:10.416 --> 13:12.512
- These shoes are cool?
- The coolest.

13:12.576 --> 13:14.471
All right, fine,
you got a deal.

13:14.548 --> 13:15.471
<i>Nice!</i>

13:15.547 --> 13:16.641
But you still gotta hurry,

13:16.716 --> 13:18.652
'cause if people find
these hidden back here,

13:18.718 --> 13:20.041
<i>they're going
to tear me alive.</i>

13:20.115 --> 13:22.041
All right, thanks.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.112
We in?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.312
Say I have juice.
Go ahead, come on.

13:25.377 --> 13:26.340
Say it.

13:26.418 --> 13:28.141
You have juice, Vince.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.611
All right, good, hurry up. Santa Monica.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.071
We're doing 75 on Olympic.
What do you want me to do?

13:44.526 --> 13:46.812
What are you doing? I thought
we were going to Disney.

13:46.878 --> 13:48.570
No, Universal.

13:48.648 --> 13:50.673
You told Bob
Disney, Ari.

13:50.745 --> 13:52.042
Did I?

13:52.445 --> 13:55.141
What are you, fucking
eight years old? Unreal.

13:55.216 --> 13:57.370
- Good morning.
- Ari Gold to see Donna Langley.

13:57.447 --> 13:58.810
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

13:58.878 --> 14:00.471
Sir, what's
that name again?

14:00.545 --> 14:04.343
Ryan, Bob Ryan.
R-Y-A-N.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.440
I'm here to see
the president of the studio.

14:06.518 --> 14:08.710
Yeah, well, I don't have
a drive-on for a Bob Ryan.

14:10.547 --> 14:13.673
You can use the phone over there
and call the president's office.

14:22.348 --> 14:23.913
Who's the president again?

14:31.118 --> 14:32.242
He's not answering, Ari.

14:32.315 --> 14:33.740
It's 'cause he
can't hear it.

14:33.816 --> 14:36.142
Why don't you get a direct
line to his hearing aid?

14:36.217 --> 14:37.873
I'm not going
in there without him.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.813
- Be reasonable, E.
- Blow me.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.341
That's not very nice.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.443
Jacqueline's ready
for you.

14:43.518 --> 14:45.110
Actually we're waiting
for a third.

14:45.177 --> 14:47.350
Is there any way we can
push it back a few minutes?

14:47.418 --> 14:49.272
I can ask, but her
schedule's really tight.

14:49.345 --> 14:50.961
She leaves for New York
in 25 minutes.

14:51.055 --> 14:53.573
- Let's go, E.
- Fine.

14:55.146 --> 14:56.911
If you need to put
your phone on vibrate

14:56.975 --> 14:58.812
and it's your first
meeting, press one!

14:58.875 --> 15:01.973
Ari, what a pleasure.

15:02.046 --> 15:03.872
Sorry.
Come right on in.

15:03.946 --> 15:04.911
Hi, how are you?

15:04.978 --> 15:06.140
It's nice to meet you.

15:07.317 --> 15:08.640
Drama?

15:12.016 --> 15:14.040
Yo, Drama,
let's go, bro.

15:14.115 --> 15:15.311
Dude, you in there?

15:15.375 --> 15:17.173
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

15:17.247 --> 15:20.041
You are not a pussy.
You are not a pussy.

15:20.116 --> 15:22.972
- You are not a puss...
- Yo, Drama, what the fuck, man?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.473
You are a pussy.

15:26.816 --> 15:28.572
Look at you.
You make me sick.

15:28.647 --> 15:30.741
Suck it up,
you little bitch!

15:30.817 --> 15:34.143
Yo, Drama! You're murdering
my whole fucking day here.

15:34.218 --> 15:35.870
What are you gonna do?

15:35.948 --> 15:37.512
What are you
gonna do?

15:37.576 --> 15:39.311
Huh, what
are you gonna do?

15:45.676 --> 15:48.712
Jesus fuckin'...

15:53.946 --> 15:56.370
Two minutes, Eddie,
and I'll be all good.

16:00.248 --> 16:03.163
Fuck, does anybody know what
the fuck he's doing in there?

16:03.256 --> 16:04.223
I do.

16:05.477 --> 16:07.573
His mic's still on.

16:11.718 --> 16:14.371
<i>Oh yeah... oh, baby...</i>

16:16.515 --> 16:19.511
Jesus Christ. Beano, come
here, you gotta hear this.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.041
Forget about it.
He's rubbing one out.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.071
Unbelievable.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.371
<i>Oh yeah,
look at you...</i>

16:33.177 --> 16:34.572
- Fuck!
- What?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.113
I  think that's
DJ AM's car.

16:36.175 --> 16:38.973
- So?
- Sneakerhead, size 11. Not good.

16:39.048 --> 16:40.843
Just chill.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.972
Tell me you're going
a size up nowadays, AM.

16:51.045 --> 16:53.140
No dice, Turtle. I'm sorry,
man. What's up, Vince?

16:53.206 --> 16:55.310
Just trying to get my boy
some sneaks. What's up?

16:55.405 --> 16:57.543
I was doing better before
you started negotiating.

16:57.605 --> 16:59.572
You know what I had to
go through to get these?

16:59.645 --> 17:02.272
Not only do I have to spin this
kid's sister's birthday party,

17:02.336 --> 17:03.710
I gotta have it
in my club LAX.

17:03.776 --> 17:07.672
Look, Turtle's desperate for
those shoes. Anything I can do?

17:07.746 --> 17:09.172
I'm sorry, man,
there's no dice.

17:09.246 --> 17:11.342
I've been waiting on
these since Christmas, man.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.372
- I knew about them in November.
- You got me there.

17:14.448 --> 17:15.942
But I got these.
Later, Vince.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.122
Late.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.142
Come on, man.

17:19.214 --> 17:22.573
Yo, sorry, Vince, but I didn't actually
think that was you on the phone.

17:22.647 --> 17:25.842
Besides, that cat's gonna pay for
my sister's birthday party, dog.

17:25.915 --> 17:28.111
And that's more important
than your word, kid?

17:28.175 --> 17:31.170
Come on, homey, you know how it is
in this crazy little world of ours.

17:31.235 --> 17:34.943
- No rules apply.
- What a nightmare.

17:35.017 --> 17:36.312
Come on, let's go.

17:36.377 --> 17:38.513
I'm sorry, Turtle.
Come on, I'm really sorry.

17:38.575 --> 17:39.972
I hate it when
you're mad at me.

17:40.047 --> 17:42.742
First I lose my rapper,
then I lose my limiteds.

17:42.818 --> 17:45.540
I'm not mad, Vin,
I'm just sad.

17:45.615 --> 17:47.340
I'm really really sad.

17:48.745 --> 17:50.142
Did I tell you
or did I tell you?

17:50.218 --> 17:51.910
I'm like motherfucking
Caesar.

17:51.976 --> 17:53.291
I came, I saw,
I conquered!

17:53.358 --> 17:55.190
Ari, I gotta admit
you were fucking awesome.

17:55.255 --> 17:57.970
- Did I take care of Bob?
- You did. Now call him and tell him.

17:58.046 --> 18:01.073
You call him. I'm going to call
Paramount and get a bidding war started.

18:01.138 --> 18:02.190
Paramount passed, Ari.

18:02.227 --> 18:04.782
Paramount passed before they
found out Universal didn't pass.

18:04.845 --> 18:07.160
It's like high school, E.
You can't fuck the prom queen

18:07.256 --> 18:10.660
till she finds out her best friend
jerked you off underneath the bleachers.

18:26.816 --> 18:28.611
No answer.
He must be miserable.

18:28.678 --> 18:32.140
The more miserable he is, the bigger
the upswing when he gets the good news.

18:32.217 --> 18:33.672
That's great, Ari.

18:33.748 --> 18:37.141
Nobody went up there
and told you nothing.

18:37.218 --> 18:38.840
It's not the same anymore.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.571
It's different now. It's not
just happening over there,

18:41.648 --> 18:44.341
it's not just happening over
there. It's happening here.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.942
It's happening everywhere.

18:46.016 --> 18:49.940
All three of them went boom,
boom, boom, one after the next.

18:50.015 --> 18:51.513
He's good.

18:51.578 --> 18:54.970
I'm not just gonna stand around
and let that happen to nobody,

18:55.048 --> 18:57.370
not in my town.

18:57.445 --> 19:00.773
Not in any of
my five towns.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.920
All right, Johnny, that was perfect.

19:04.985 --> 19:07.313
That was great, man. Guys,
do me a favor: keep rolling,

19:07.378 --> 19:10.711
zoom in a little bit. Just want to grab
a couple of reaction shots, all right?

19:10.775 --> 19:12.413
Reaction shots?

19:12.478 --> 19:15.571
Yeah, can you give me one
where you're... you're angry?

19:15.648 --> 19:18.272
Okay, angry.

19:18.348 --> 19:20.012
All right.

19:23.217 --> 19:24.642
Nice, nice.

19:24.716 --> 19:27.333
Let's get one where you're
just like a little bit sad.

19:27.427 --> 19:28.290
Sad?

19:34.217 --> 19:36.970
All right, good, good.
Let's do one more where, um,

19:37.046 --> 19:39.070
you're kind of
a little bit embarrassed.

19:40.118 --> 19:41.371
Embarrassed?

19:45.117 --> 19:46.533
Why would I be
embarrassed?

19:46.598 --> 19:49.523
Well look, you just poured your
heart and soul out to this guy, right?

19:49.587 --> 19:51.270
You don't even know
if he was listening.

19:51.347 --> 19:53.113
You don't even know
if he gives a shit.

19:53.246 --> 19:56.971
Uh, I don't know that I'm
feeling embarrassed about that.

20:02.945 --> 20:05.811
Look, before, when you
went to your trailer?

20:05.876 --> 20:08.811
You had your mic on
when you were whackin' it.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.912
All right? The entire crew heard you.

20:21.175 --> 20:23.511
Got it. Great. Guys, that's a wrap.

20:23.577 --> 20:24.571
Johnny, great job.

20:30.177 --> 20:32.240
<i>You know, the guy's a genius.</i>

20:32.305 --> 20:34.442
He'll do whatever he's got
to do to get it on film.

20:34.515 --> 20:36.773
And you know what? You were
right. Your method works.

20:36.848 --> 20:39.712
Next time anxiety
rears its ugly head,

20:39.775 --> 20:41.711
I'm just gonna
beat it back down.

20:41.775 --> 20:43.213
Glad you had
a great day, Drama.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.812
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Mine sucked.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.773
I don't care
how much it costs.

20:46.848 --> 20:48.513
Okay, cool.
Bye.

20:48.577 --> 20:51.243
Who do you keep whispering
sweet nothings to over there?

20:51.316 --> 20:52.852
Start filling out
your W-2, Vince.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.450
- You're going back to work.
- Yeah?

20:54.487 --> 20:57.213
Universal's in. Ari's gonna get
Paramount to match it or better.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.053
- I'm gonna be Joey Ramone?
- It's just a question of for how much.

21:00.147 --> 21:01.670
Nice!
Good work!

21:01.745 --> 21:03.802
Glad to see you all
had good days.

21:03.868 --> 21:05.070
What's with this one?

21:05.108 --> 21:06.703
He couldn't get the sneakers he wanted.

21:06.768 --> 21:09.051
But I got him the best weed
in L.A. to make up for it.

21:09.118 --> 21:11.140
I don't want to smoke, Vin.
It'll make me cry.

21:11.215 --> 21:12.943
Oh, come on.
Let's go.

21:13.015 --> 21:13.913
All right.

21:14.418 --> 21:16.970
- So is Bob excited?
- That's a whole other story.

21:24.478 --> 21:27.711
- Totally uncool of Ari.
- And Bob won't call me back.

21:27.775 --> 21:29.742
Hey guys, I feel bad
for Bob and all,

21:29.815 --> 21:31.773
but I've got my own
career going on finally.

21:31.848 --> 21:33.061
Yeah, and?

21:33.125 --> 21:36.201
And I'm a little concerned
about where the fuck we are.

21:36.345 --> 21:39.741
Relax, we're cool.
Turtle, pull over here.

21:41.846 --> 21:44.270
You gotta be
kidding me.

21:44.347 --> 21:45.771
Oh, Christ.

21:45.846 --> 21:49.673
All right, Turtle. Go ask
for Jimmy and give him this.

21:49.745 --> 21:52.273
- What is it?
- Emergency fund. Go.

21:52.346 --> 21:54.440
- No one's going with me?
- Nope.

21:54.515 --> 21:55.941
Vince, what the hell
is going on?

21:56.016 --> 21:58.213
I feel like Sonny
Corleone at the toll booth.

21:58.277 --> 22:00.642
Come on, Turtle, have I
ever put you in harm's way?

22:00.716 --> 22:02.743
- No.
- Then go, Turtle, go.

22:13.147 --> 22:14.643
'Sup, fellas?

22:14.716 --> 22:16.810
Is Jimmy around?

22:16.875 --> 22:17.841
He's inside.

22:17.918 --> 22:19.670
Inside?
All right.

22:21.646 --> 22:23.343
I'll walk you in.

22:39.565 --> 22:41.401
- You Turtle?
- Yeah, you Jimmy?

22:41.525 --> 22:42.481
Yeah.

22:45.747 --> 22:47.443
I hear you like
my sneakers.

22:51.965 --> 22:54.973
Holy shit!
Wait, you're Fukijama?

22:56.116 --> 22:57.513
What, you don't
live in Japan?

22:57.578 --> 23:00.012
Born and raised
in Glendale, my man.

23:00.077 --> 23:01.810
I'm sorry the new kicks
went so quick,

23:01.876 --> 23:05.770
but I made you an even more
limited edition.

23:12.476 --> 23:15.751
Only one...
of one.

23:17.285 --> 23:18.821
Holy...

23:19.096 --> 23:20.631
Can I...?

23:27.176 --> 23:29.733
- 5,000?
- A little bit more.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.630
- For sneakers?
- 5,250.

23:32.787 --> 23:33.981
A little bit more.

23:34.088 --> 23:35.873
Jesus Christ.
For sneakers, Vince?

23:35.915 --> 23:36.932
You need mental help.

23:37.005 --> 23:38.473
They're not
just sneakers, E.

23:38.577 --> 23:40.043
They're wearable art.

23:40.147 --> 23:43.372
Besides, the joy that Turtle's
feeling right now is worth every penny.

23:43.448 --> 23:44.772
5,500.

23:45.016 --> 23:46.070
A little bit more.

23:46.178 --> 23:47.570
Christ.

23:47.668 --> 23:50.270
- Yeah, Ari?
- E, I have Ari and Bob for you.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.001
Ari, here's E and Bob.

23:52.085 --> 23:53.843
Bob, you have E and Ari...

23:53.898 --> 23:55.741
Shut the fuck up, Lloyd.
Bob, you there?

23:55.827 --> 23:58.681
- We got some great news, Bob.
- You're all taken care of, Bob.

23:58.788 --> 24:01.672
Oh, you bet I am, Ari, because
nobody fucks Bob but Bob.

24:01.735 --> 24:04.023
Bob, Ari is so sorry.
Ari, tell him you're sorry.

24:04.085 --> 24:05.261
I am sorry, Bob.

24:05.326 --> 24:07.883
And nobody fucked you, Bob.
You got everything you wanted.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.273
You're right, Eric,
I did,

24:09.336 --> 24:11.541
'cause after I got
tossed off the Disney lot

24:11.618 --> 24:14.772
I went around the block to see my
old friend Alan at Warners, and...

24:14.847 --> 24:18.063
Man, does he hate
young Vincent.

24:18.127 --> 24:20.200
Bob, tell me you didn't
do something stupid.

24:20.297 --> 24:22.890
Stupid, Ari? What if I was to tell you

24:22.988 --> 24:25.533
that I sold the picture
to my friend Alan?

24:25.626 --> 24:27.681
Is that something you
might be interested in?

24:27.746 --> 24:29.973
- Bob, let's talk about this.
- Hold on. Bob...

24:30.035 --> 24:31.693
I've talked enough.

24:31.977 --> 24:32.840
Bob?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.660
- Bob?
- Bob, let's talk about this.

24:34.796 --> 24:36.441
Lloyd!
Get Bob back!

24:36.608 --> 24:38.682
Bob.
Bob!

24:38.895 --> 24:40.271
What's going on?

24:42.318 --> 24:44.813
Bob just sold
the project to Warners.

24:45.178 --> 24:46.143
Wow.

24:46.537 --> 24:47.950
That's not good.

24:48.045 --> 24:49.541
No, it's not.

24:51.175 --> 24:53.110
You ready?

24:55.656 --> 24:57.072
How sweet are these?

24:59.078 --> 25:00.462
What's going on?

25:00.556 --> 25:04.543
Oh, nothing, I just spent 20 grand
on sneakers and I don't have a job.
