00:22.904 --> 00:24.336
Hey, what the hell?

00:24.338 --> 00:25.771
You could've killed me!

00:25.773 --> 00:26.872
What are you doing?!

00:26.874 --> 00:28.674
Campbell! You want
to explain to me

00:28.676 --> 00:30.575
why you didn't secure
that equipment?

00:30.577 --> 00:33.578
Make it stop. Please.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.347
Make it stop.
All-all right. All right.

00:35.349 --> 00:36.682
Calm down, sailor.
What's wrong?

00:36.684 --> 00:37.749
Get it out.

00:37.751 --> 00:39.051
Hey.
Get it out of my head!

00:39.053 --> 00:40.252
Hey, somebody
get him some water.

00:40.254 --> 00:42.187
Water, please.

00:42.790 --> 00:44.723
Hey. It's okay.
No. No.

00:44.725 --> 00:46.845
Hey, you're gonna be all
right. You're gonna be-- Hey!

I'm telling you, Pride,

01:21.293 --> 01:23.661
if I'm right about this,
then I'm wrong.

01:23.663 --> 01:25.295
Well, not that-that
I was wrong, per Se,

01:25.297 --> 01:27.130
but just that the initial
calculations were incorrect.

01:27.132 --> 01:28.966
But since those
came from the FBI

01:28.968 --> 01:30.700
and not me...
Rambling.

01:30.702 --> 01:32.535
Right, sorry.

01:32.537 --> 01:34.338
It's an ongoing challenge.

01:34.340 --> 01:37.007
We've come out here many times
in the last several weeks,

01:37.009 --> 01:39.376
and have yet to find anything
to help us figure out

01:39.378 --> 01:40.978
who killed Javier Garcia.
Okay, right.

01:40.980 --> 01:43.213
Well, that-that brings us
back to the calculations.

01:43.215 --> 01:45.215
So, we've been operating
under the belief

01:45.217 --> 01:47.350
that the upward thrust
of the car bomb's detonator

01:47.352 --> 01:49.920
sent the shrapnel out
in a concentric arc, right?

01:49.921 --> 01:50.376
Yeah?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.022
But what if the FI
never accounted

01:52.023 --> 01:54.524
for a-a lateral dispersion?

01:54.526 --> 01:57.594
Well, then the blast zone
would've been more asymmetrical?

01:57.596 --> 01:58.828
Exactly.

01:58.830 --> 02:01.097
Which would've sent
the shrapnel out

02:01.099 --> 02:02.365
in a whole different
trajectory.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.400
Now, if <i>my</i> calculations
are right,

02:04.402 --> 02:07.270
we might be able
to find something...

02:08.372 --> 02:09.471
...right around...

02:10.574 --> 02:12.408
...there.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.617
Or not.

02:30.528 --> 02:34.095
How about...
something like this?

02:35.365 --> 02:37.232
Oh, yeah.

02:37.234 --> 02:39.000
Melted metal,

02:39.002 --> 02:40.635
outward protuberance,
yeah, yeah.

02:40.637 --> 02:43.071
This-this could be
from the detonator.

02:43.073 --> 02:45.140
Pride, this might be the smoking
gun we've been looking for.

02:45.142 --> 02:48.643
Pretty charred though;
been out here a long time.

02:48.645 --> 02:50.778
Still think you can get
trace evidence?

02:50.780 --> 02:51.879
Oh, yeah, believe me,

02:51.881 --> 02:53.213
if I can find anything

02:53.215 --> 02:56.250
to link Mayor Hamilton
to Garcia's murder, I will.

02:56.252 --> 02:58.218
I know how much
this means to you.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.987
Thanks.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.124
Well, we're gonna
have to backburner it for now.

03:04.126 --> 03:05.192
We got to work.

03:05.194 --> 03:07.261
Dead petty officer
in Belle Chasse.

03:07.263 --> 03:08.763
Let's go.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.471
<i>What do we know, Christopher?</i>

03:17.473 --> 03:19.206
Petty Officer Robert Campbell,

03:19.208 --> 03:21.575
a member of a construction
detachment out of Gulfport,

03:21.577 --> 03:24.678
took a dive from five stories up
for reasons unknown.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.912
As in, he
killed himself?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.280
That's what we're here
to find out.

03:27.282 --> 03:29.082
That was Campbell's
officer in charge.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.650
He said
before Campbell jumped,

03:30.652 --> 03:32.018
he talked about
a pain in his head,

03:32.020 --> 03:33.687
that he couldn't take it.

03:33.689 --> 03:35.789
Okay. Any history of drug abuse,

03:35.791 --> 03:37.290
psychological issues?

03:37.292 --> 03:39.325
Well, psych eval's normal,
drug tests clean.

03:39.327 --> 03:41.895
Nothing I can see here
that would raise any red flags.

03:41.897 --> 03:43.863
I questioned
nearly every man in his unit;

03:43.865 --> 03:45.764
they all said
Campbell was full of life,

03:45.766 --> 03:47.867
the last guy
they'd expect that from.

03:47.869 --> 03:50.103
A man doesn't
just jump for no reason.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.106
Something drove him
over the edge.

03:53.108 --> 03:55.274
Need to know what.
Loretta.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.775
Well, judging from
the massive head trauma

03:56.777 --> 03:58.844
and the hemorrhaging
from the ears, nose and mouth...

04:00.848 --> 04:02.047
...there's no doubt
Campbell died

04:02.049 --> 04:03.549
from the impact of the fall.

04:03.551 --> 04:06.051
He complained of head pain
just before he jumped.

04:06.053 --> 04:08.320
Any indication
of what caused it?

04:08.322 --> 04:10.556
I'd have to get him
into autopsy,

04:10.558 --> 04:13.492
but there was
one thing peculiar.

04:15.029 --> 04:16.461
His eyes are jaundiced.

04:16.463 --> 04:18.296
That didn't happen
from the fall.

04:18.298 --> 04:22.100
But some pre-existing condition
could've made that happen.

04:22.101 --> 04:23.868
Yeah, gallstones,
bile obstructions.

04:23.870 --> 04:25.203
Something tells me constipation

04:25.205 --> 04:26.804
isn't what pushed him
over the ledge.

04:26.806 --> 04:28.407
Agent Pride?

04:28.409 --> 04:30.308
Lieutenant Commander Lopez.

04:30.310 --> 04:31.876
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to greet you.

04:31.878 --> 04:33.244
I had to update
the base C.O.

04:33.246 --> 04:34.412
Commander.

04:34.414 --> 04:36.014
P.O. Campbell's
one of yours?

04:36.016 --> 04:39.183
I've been overseeing
the Seabees' work here,

04:39.185 --> 04:41.118
40 of the finest men in uniform.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.589
I'm sorry for your loss.

04:44.591 --> 04:46.591
Any idea why Campbell
might've done this?

04:46.593 --> 04:48.325
No, none.

04:48.327 --> 04:50.994
He's been on time and on task,
and working his tail off

04:50.996 --> 04:53.030
with the rest of my men
to complete the install.

04:53.032 --> 04:56.033
What is it
that you're installing here?

04:56.035 --> 04:58.035
High-speed fiber
optic cable.

04:58.037 --> 04:59.736
Wiring the entire building.

04:59.738 --> 05:03.140
Travel these men down from
Gulfport just to lay some cable?

05:03.142 --> 05:05.609
The base's newest I.T. building.

05:05.611 --> 05:07.044
Getting it online

05:07.046 --> 05:09.446
is paramount
for a variety of reasons.

05:10.983 --> 05:13.283
Do you mind if I go check up
on the rest of my men?

05:13.285 --> 05:14.718
They're pretty shaken.

05:14.720 --> 05:15.886
Course.

05:23.628 --> 05:24.860
Something wrong?

05:24.862 --> 05:26.896
No, just...

05:26.898 --> 05:29.665
seems strange to bring down
a detachment unit

05:29.667 --> 05:32.469
just to install
fiber optic cable.

05:32.471 --> 05:34.237
Well, it is a pretty
specialized install.

05:34.239 --> 05:35.838
Hey, check this out.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.007
I just did a quick rundown
on Campbell's unit.

05:38.009 --> 05:39.475
Looks like he
wasn't the only one

05:39.477 --> 05:40.542
not feeling well.

05:40.544 --> 05:41.777
All right,
Petty Officer Bryan Howard

05:41.779 --> 05:43.813
apparently checked
himself into

05:43.815 --> 05:44.981
the base clinic
last night,

05:44.983 --> 05:46.916
and he is now sick in quarters.

05:46.918 --> 05:49.284
You'd think the commander
would've mentioned that.

05:49.286 --> 05:52.421
Sebastian, go with Wade
back to the morgue,

05:52.423 --> 05:53.422
when she's ready.

05:53.424 --> 05:55.124
Let me know as soon
as you find out

05:55.126 --> 05:57.259
what Campbell might've been
suffering from.

05:57.261 --> 06:00.862
Meanwhile, we'll go pay
Petty Officer Howard a visit.

06:07.605 --> 06:09.938
I woke up in the middle
of the night,

06:09.940 --> 06:13.241
felt this pressure,
like my head was gonna burst.

06:13.243 --> 06:15.476
Thoughts weren't
making any sense.

06:15.478 --> 06:17.245
It was scary as hell, man.

06:17.247 --> 06:19.547
So you checked yourself
into the clinic?

06:19.549 --> 06:22.350
Doc said I had
dehydration sickness.

06:22.352 --> 06:25.687
Gave me some fluids,
sedatives, sent me on my way.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.855
Well, you were up on that
scaffolding with Campbell

06:27.857 --> 06:30.625
all week, exposed to the sun,
working your butt off, right?

06:30.627 --> 06:31.859
That's right.

06:31.861 --> 06:33.161
So, dehydration, heat stroke--

06:33.163 --> 06:34.662
maybe that's what this is.

06:36.599 --> 06:40.034
If that's all this is, he should
be getting better, not worse.

06:42.172 --> 06:43.804
You mind?

06:45.641 --> 06:48.542
His eyes are jaundiced,
just like Campbell's.

06:48.544 --> 06:50.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you saying

06:50.412 --> 06:52.245
whatever I've got's
what made Robert jump?

06:52.247 --> 06:54.715
No, we're not saying
anything, sailor.

06:54.717 --> 06:58.118
We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.387
So, you woke up
in the middle of the night,

07:00.389 --> 07:01.421
sick.

07:01.423 --> 07:03.122
Any idea what caused it?

07:03.124 --> 07:04.691
I don't know.

07:04.693 --> 07:06.526
When did Campbell
start showing symptoms?

07:06.528 --> 07:08.228
Around the same time?
Yeah, about.

07:08.230 --> 07:10.497
But he just went back to bed.

07:10.499 --> 07:12.299
Look, Campbell
was a beast, okay?

07:12.301 --> 07:14.668
He probably could've taken
a bullet and gone back to work.

07:14.670 --> 07:15.868
Anybody else get sick?

07:15.870 --> 07:17.070
I mean,
something's going around.

07:17.072 --> 07:18.370
You share any food or drink?

07:18.372 --> 07:20.573
No. Although...

07:22.844 --> 07:24.043
Although what?

07:24.045 --> 07:26.679
We had a king cake
delivered to us.

07:26.681 --> 07:27.847
We all had some.

07:27.849 --> 07:29.215
Delivered by who?

07:29.217 --> 07:32.418
The note just said,
“Welcome to Belle Chasse.”

07:33.188 --> 07:34.553
We didn't eat
all of it.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.090
I think Robert stashed the
rest in his foot locker.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.699
Angelo Brocato's cakes.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.435
Whoa.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.536
King,

07:51.538 --> 07:52.971
take a look at this.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.507
Blood in the eyes,
foam in the mouth.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.044
No way that's just from
food poisoning, right?

08:00.748 --> 08:02.413
No way.

08:16.985 --> 08:20.954
Any idea what kind of poison
we might be dealing with here?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.220
I've tested all the
usual suspects--

08:23.222 --> 08:26.790
cyanide, arsenic, strychnine--
they all came back negative.

08:26.792 --> 08:30.093
Yeah, and I checked for ricin,
sarin and poison arrow frog.

08:30.095 --> 08:31.027
No match.

08:31.029 --> 08:32.596
Still, some type
of poison

08:32.597 --> 08:34.998
mutated Petty Officer
Campbell's cells,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.566
caused severe brain swelling.

08:36.568 --> 08:39.102
That explains
what drove him off the ledge.

08:39.104 --> 08:41.104
You know, tetrodotoxin
could've caused cell mutation,

08:41.106 --> 08:43.472
but it... it's faster acting
than what killed Campbell.

08:43.475 --> 08:44.874
Have you checked for polonium?

08:44.876 --> 08:46.109
Hey.

08:46.111 --> 08:49.112
Why aren't the two of you
working side by side?

08:49.114 --> 08:51.814
Sebastian's a bit
of a hypochondriac.

08:51.816 --> 08:54.550
Or, you know, some people
might just say extra careful.

08:54.552 --> 08:56.419
You know. I-I have
a thing about poisons.

08:56.421 --> 08:58.321
It's like how some people are

08:58.323 --> 09:02.190
afraid of snakes or spiders or..
circus clowns, you know.

09:02.192 --> 09:05.160
Four more Seabees from
Campbell's unit were just

09:05.162 --> 09:06.461
admitted into a clinic,

09:06.463 --> 09:08.664
and Petty Officer Howard
is getting sicker.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.965
The base C.O. is isolating them

09:09.967 --> 09:11.433
until they know
what's causing it.

09:11.435 --> 09:13.135
It's odd
that it's affecting people

09:13.137 --> 09:15.270
at vastly different rates.

09:15.272 --> 09:16.705
Poisons don't usually
work that way.

09:16.707 --> 09:19.041
Then we need
to find out what does

09:19.043 --> 09:20.375
before we lose anyone else.

09:20.377 --> 09:22.477
Sebastian, work <i>with</i> Loretta,

09:22.479 --> 09:23.878
side by side, and learn things.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.047
Okay, but the...

09:26.517 --> 09:28.116
Need to know who ordered
that cake, Patton.

09:28.118 --> 09:30.085
And I wish I can tell you,
but I can't

09:30.087 --> 09:31.719
get anybody from the bakery
on the phone.

09:31.721 --> 09:33.321
This time of day,
that's strange.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.389
Yeah, but I did check
with the base, and according to

09:35.391 --> 09:37.959
their gate log, Angelo Brocato
did, in fact, deliver a cake

09:37.961 --> 09:40.662
at 21:00 hours.
Addressed to who?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.864
No name in particular,
just Barracks 53.

09:42.866 --> 09:45.033
Campbell's unit.
Sounds like they were targeted.

09:45.035 --> 09:47.268
Why? Bunch of Seabees
installing cables.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.003
Yeah, maybe not.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.538
Christopher, Gregorio,
go to Angelo Brocato's.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.540
I want to know
who sent that cake.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.708
Patton, search
surveillance cameras

09:54.710 --> 09:56.343
around the bakery,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.446
I.D. everyone who came in
and out of there yesterday.

09:58.448 --> 10:00.448
Copy that.
Who you calling?

10:00.450 --> 10:02.283
Belle Chasse.
Commander Lopez, please.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.651
I want to know what those
Seabees were really doing.

10:04.653 --> 10:07.220
Tell her
it's Agent Pride, NCIS.

10:17.766 --> 10:19.733
Excuse me.

10:19.735 --> 10:21.201
Federal agents.
You work here?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.368
Um, yeah.

10:22.370 --> 10:23.769
Why? Is there
something wrong?

10:23.771 --> 10:26.005
The bakery usually closed
at this hour?

10:26.007 --> 10:27.340
No.

10:27.342 --> 10:29.175
Should've been open hours ago.

10:29.177 --> 10:30.910
I mean, I just got here
for my afternoon shift.

10:30.912 --> 10:32.979
I don't know why
my boss didn't call me.

10:32.981 --> 10:35.982
Honestly, I'm a
little worried.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.001
Door's open.

11:17.758 --> 11:21.826
Oh, no. Jaundiced eyes
and foaming at the mouth.

11:22.896 --> 11:24.996
Same symptoms
as the Seabees.

11:24.998 --> 11:26.698
From sampling the same cake?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.232
I don't think so.

11:28.234 --> 11:30.768
He's got defensive wounds
on his arms and hands.

11:30.770 --> 11:32.303
Looks like he put up a fight.

11:32.305 --> 11:33.771
And lost.

11:35.542 --> 11:37.941
What in the world
is going on here?

11:41.581 --> 11:43.914
Richard Logan's been working
at Angelo Brocato's

11:43.916 --> 11:45.983
for as long as
I can remember.

11:45.985 --> 11:47.985
Yeah, best pastry chef
they've got, too.

11:47.987 --> 11:50.020
Folks order
his king cakes by name.

11:50.022 --> 11:52.522
Only way he would've poisoned
the Seabees' cake...

11:52.524 --> 11:54.925
Is if he was forced
into doing it.

11:54.927 --> 11:56.827
Doc says the killer
knocked out Logan

11:56.829 --> 11:58.762
and must have injected him

11:58.764 --> 12:00.664
with the same poison
that killed our Seabee.

12:00.666 --> 12:01.965
She got time of death?

12:01.967 --> 12:03.733
Yes. Between 9:00
and 10:00 last night,

12:03.735 --> 12:05.569
which, according to
Patton, is the same time

12:05.571 --> 12:07.304
the cake was delivered
to the base.

12:07.306 --> 12:10.473
So killer waits for
customers to leave,

12:10.475 --> 12:12.609
forces the baker
to poison the cake,

12:12.611 --> 12:15.178
and then waits... until
it's delivered to kill him? Why?

12:15.180 --> 12:16.646
Killer probably
didn't want

12:16.648 --> 12:19.215
Logan to I.D. him--
tried to cover his tracks.

12:19.217 --> 12:21.450
Yeah, but by leaving
Logan's body for us to find,

12:21.452 --> 12:22.852
it does anything but.

12:22.854 --> 12:24.020
Sloppy.

12:24.022 --> 12:25.621
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

12:25.623 --> 12:27.156
Still, you think
our Seabees were targeted?

12:27.158 --> 12:28.758
No reason not to.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.360
Especially since I can't get
in contact with Commander Lopez.

12:31.362 --> 12:32.929
Even checked with her C.O.

12:32.931 --> 12:35.198
at Gulfport.
Think she went U.A.?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.832
The base C.O.
at Belle Chasse checked

12:36.834 --> 12:38.367
the exit logs;
says that she left

12:38.369 --> 12:40.168
right after we did this morning.

12:40.170 --> 12:42.804
So, wait, are we thinking
she's a suspect now?

12:42.806 --> 12:44.640
Well, only way to know
is to find her.

12:44.642 --> 12:46.108
Ah. One step
ahead of y'all.

12:46.110 --> 12:47.576
Check it out.

12:47.578 --> 12:49.411
I was combing through
surveillance footage

12:49.413 --> 12:51.113
around the bakery.

12:51.115 --> 12:53.148
Not a suspicious
customer in sight,

12:53.150 --> 12:56.651
until... I decided
to expand my search window.

12:56.653 --> 12:58.386
Voila.

12:58.388 --> 13:01.089
Commander Lopez.

13:01.091 --> 13:02.523
Lopez? What is
she doing there?

13:02.525 --> 13:03.691
When was this taken?

13:03.693 --> 13:04.860
About a hour and a half ago.

13:04.862 --> 13:06.762
That's right before
Tammy and I got there.

13:06.764 --> 13:08.163
Think we chased her away?

13:08.165 --> 13:10.598
Well, still, what was she doing
there in the first place?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.768
Especially considering the baker
had been dead for hours.

13:13.770 --> 13:17.104
Yeah, too many things don't add
up, and no one's talking to us.

13:17.106 --> 13:19.039
I'll call Director Vance.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.309
See if he can cut
through this bureaucracy.

13:21.311 --> 13:22.943
Guys, we got big problems.

13:22.945 --> 13:24.646
Yeah, I'm afraid
it's not good, Dwayne.

13:24.648 --> 13:26.013
No, it's worse than not good.

13:26.015 --> 13:28.649
It turns out that the cake
wasn't spiked with a poison,

13:28.651 --> 13:30.017
it was injected with a virus.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.219
When I couldn't identify
the poison, I rechecked

13:32.221 --> 13:34.054
the molecular structure
of the affected cells...

13:34.056 --> 13:36.490
And discovered that
it was actually infested

13:36.492 --> 13:38.225
with microscopic,

13:38.227 --> 13:40.294
single-strand RNAs.

13:40.296 --> 13:41.361
Which means virus?

13:41.363 --> 13:42.596
Yeah, but not just any virus.

13:42.598 --> 13:44.531
A supervirus--
we're talking

13:44.533 --> 13:47.434
Congolese hemorrhagic fever,
dengue, Ebola

13:47.436 --> 13:48.368
all rolled into one.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.369
Is it contagious?

13:49.371 --> 13:52.038
Very. But fortunately
not airborne.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.774
Right.
The only way to contract it is

13:53.776 --> 13:55.342
either through ingestion,
like with the king cake,

13:55.344 --> 13:57.511
or by touch,
so any skin-to-skin contact

13:57.513 --> 13:59.512
with the infected
can risk exposure.

13:59.514 --> 14:01.314
Means anyone
who's been around our Seabees

14:01.316 --> 14:02.982
or the cake could get it.

14:02.984 --> 14:04.417
The whole base
could be in danger.

14:04.419 --> 14:05.685
So could we.

14:05.687 --> 14:08.154
Except none of us
have shown any symptoms yet.

14:08.156 --> 14:09.722
Still no reason
to take chances.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.158
We stay put in the office
till we all get tested.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.026
Is there a cure?

14:13.028 --> 14:14.294
Not that I know of.

14:14.296 --> 14:15.628
King.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.163
This could be more than
just an attack on our Seabees.

14:18.165 --> 14:19.799
Could be bioterrorism.

14:22.002 --> 14:23.536
Get the base C.O.
on the phone.

14:23.538 --> 14:25.103
We're gonna lock down
Belle Chasse.

14:25.105 --> 14:26.839
We cannot let this get out.

14:26.841 --> 14:28.006
Dwayne.

14:30.678 --> 14:32.477
I'm afraid it already has.

15:00.938 --> 15:02.471
Dr. Wade?

15:02.473 --> 15:04.472
Oh, please,
we're wasting valuable time.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.274
Let me just work.
Yes, ma'am.

15:07.711 --> 15:09.510
Loretta!

15:10.380 --> 15:11.580
Loretta.

15:13.584 --> 15:16.117
Talk to me, Loretta.
How did this happen?

15:16.119 --> 15:17.886
It must have happened

15:17.888 --> 15:19.054
at the crime scene.

15:19.056 --> 15:22.123
Without my scrub suit on,
my skin was exposed.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.424
And you handled Campbell's body?

15:23.426 --> 15:28.028
Yeah. Blood particulates,
saliva, sweat.

15:28.030 --> 15:30.298
Doesn't take much.

15:31.334 --> 15:33.934
I assume you and your
team are all right.

15:33.936 --> 15:35.470
Yeah, we-we all tested negative.

15:35.472 --> 15:37.237
Ah, thank God
for that.

15:37.239 --> 15:39.039
Sebastian cleared, too.

15:40.776 --> 15:43.043
Next time, remind me
not to tease him

15:43.045 --> 15:45.746
about being a hypochondriac--
it may have saved his life.

15:49.952 --> 15:52.786
Should you rest, Loretta?

15:52.788 --> 15:54.254
There's no time to rest,

15:54.256 --> 15:56.089
not with others
being infected, too,

15:56.091 --> 15:57.557
and more to come

15:57.559 --> 16:00.560
if we can't stop this
virus from spreading.

16:01.696 --> 16:03.497
The situation at
Belle Chasse?

16:03.499 --> 16:06.433
Base is locked down,
the sick quarantined.

16:06.435 --> 16:08.935
Marine Chemical and Biological
Incident Response Force

16:08.937 --> 16:10.637
is on its way.

16:10.639 --> 16:12.772
How many infected so far?

16:12.774 --> 16:15.207
Seven total--
four of Campbell's Seabees,

16:15.209 --> 16:18.044
three machinists who shared
the barracks with them.

16:18.046 --> 16:20.379
Burn their clothing,
all their belongings.

16:20.381 --> 16:22.148
It's not airborne,

16:22.150 --> 16:25.417
but obviously it's
highly contagious.

16:25.419 --> 16:29.155
Deadly, if we can't
find the cure.

16:29.157 --> 16:30.623
How much time do we have?

16:30.625 --> 16:33.959
You mean how much
time do <i>I</i> have?

16:33.961 --> 16:35.894
Well...

16:35.896 --> 16:39.231
the virus affects
everybody differently.

16:39.233 --> 16:42.868
But I am monitoring my
viral load while I work,

16:42.870 --> 16:47.039
see how quickly it mutates
my white blood cells.

16:47.041 --> 16:50.341
I would say maybe...

16:50.343 --> 16:53.611
ten, 11 hours before...

16:58.786 --> 17:01.952
I can't believe
that this is happening.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.954
How's she doing?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.955
Scared, like the rest of us.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.892
She's counting on us, Sebastian.

17:07.894 --> 17:11.028
Stay focused,
for everybody's sake.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.030
Yeah, easier said than done.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.501
Got a match
from the viral database.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.737
QR6.
What is that?

17:19.739 --> 17:22.138
It's a-a supervirus developed
by the Chinese military,

17:22.141 --> 17:24.775
but supposedly, it
never left their lab.

17:24.777 --> 17:27.078
Pride, if this is right, then
this has to be bioterrorism.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.946
I mean, there's no
two ways about it.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.280
But why now? Why Belle Chasse?

17:30.282 --> 17:31.548
I don't know.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.050
I mean, the only good news
is that there's no way

17:34.052 --> 17:36.119
they would have developed
this lethal a bug

17:36.121 --> 17:37.721
without also developing
an antidote.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.656
So even if Loretta
can't come up with a cure...

17:39.658 --> 17:41.425
Yeah, then we can,
as long as we can

17:41.427 --> 17:42.693
find whoever infected
that king cake.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.294
'Cause they'll
probably have the antidote,

17:44.296 --> 17:46.029
since they don't want
to get infected, too.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.897
Only problem is we don't
have that much time.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.432
All right, stay here,
help Loretta.

17:49.434 --> 17:50.911
Wait, hold on, you got
to get me on that base.

17:50.935 --> 17:51.501
What?

17:51.502 --> 17:53.269
Victims are being infected
at different rates, right?

17:53.271 --> 17:55.205
Which means some are
more resistant to the virus than others.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.975
If I can test their blood, then
maybe I can create my own cure.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.910
I'm-I'm not willing to risk
you getting sick, too...

18:00.912 --> 18:02.411
That's not your choice!

18:05.516 --> 18:06.982
Please, Pride.

18:06.984 --> 18:08.384
I-I know that you want

18:08.386 --> 18:10.286
to do everything you
can to save Loretta,

18:10.288 --> 18:11.654
but so do I, all right?

18:11.656 --> 18:13.956
I-I can't lose her.

18:18.863 --> 18:21.564
We're not gonna lose her,
Sebastian.

18:25.369 --> 18:28.603
I'll get you on with
the Marine Bio Response Force.

18:28.605 --> 18:31.073
You work with them,
but listen to me--

18:31.075 --> 18:32.474
Hazmat suit,

18:32.476 --> 18:34.109
wrist tape, the works.

18:34.111 --> 18:36.979
I can't lose <i>you,</i> either.

18:42.051 --> 18:43.752
Oh, wait. Pride.

18:43.754 --> 18:44.952
Pride.

18:44.954 --> 18:46.821
I almost forgot. Uh...

18:46.823 --> 18:48.690
I was able to get a
partial fingerprint

18:48.692 --> 18:50.091
off of that, uh,
Garcia shrapnel.

18:50.093 --> 18:51.660
It's not enough
for an I.D.,

18:51.662 --> 18:53.495
and obviously it's no
way to tie the bombing

18:53.497 --> 18:55.963
to Mayor Hamilton,
but it's a start.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.932
Okay, wh-why are you
showing me this now?

18:57.934 --> 19:00.835
Just, you know, in case
something happens to me.

19:04.140 --> 19:07.175
We'll work on this later,
Sebastian, together.

19:08.411 --> 19:10.344
Focus.

19:11.614 --> 19:13.580
Agent Pride.

19:30.899 --> 19:34.367
Just got off the phone with the
Office of Naval Intelligence.

19:34.369 --> 19:36.769
Finally admitted that
Commander Lopez and her team

19:36.771 --> 19:38.905
were doing
more than just

19:38.907 --> 19:41.041
installing cable
at Belle Chasse.

19:41.043 --> 19:43.076
More, meaning what?
Don't know yet.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.911
ONI needs clearance
to get us read in.

19:45.913 --> 19:48.614
Apparently, it's top secret,
compartmentalized.

19:48.616 --> 19:50.450
They want to keep it that way

19:50.452 --> 19:52.151
until they can get
more specifics

19:52.153 --> 19:54.253
about what the Chinese
are really after.

19:54.255 --> 19:56.288
Targeting Seabees
on a top secret project

19:56.290 --> 19:57.957
not specific
enough for them?

19:57.959 --> 20:00.593
The less people know
exactly what the project is,

20:00.595 --> 20:03.528
the better,
far as they're concerned.

20:03.530 --> 20:07.766
ONI just wants us focusing on
catching whoever's responsible.

20:07.768 --> 20:10.035
What about Commander Lopez?
Did they hear from her?

20:10.037 --> 20:11.937
No. And they're worried.

20:11.939 --> 20:14.673
Turns out they're the ones
who sent her to the bakery

20:14.675 --> 20:16.308
to quietly investigate.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.910
Well, maybe she heard about
the king cake from her men.

20:18.912 --> 20:20.979
At least that explains
why she was there.

20:20.981 --> 20:22.280
Yeah, but not why
she disappeared.

20:22.282 --> 20:23.782
You find anything
on the watch list?

20:23.784 --> 20:26.985
Yeah, a list of Chinese
nationals linked to MSS,

20:26.987 --> 20:29.187
but it'll take us all week
to narrow it down.

20:29.189 --> 20:30.389
Loretta doesn't have all week

20:30.391 --> 20:32.156
and neither do
the other victims.

20:32.158 --> 20:34.792
We need another way to find out
who did this, fast.

20:34.794 --> 20:36.660
Might have
something in here.

20:36.662 --> 20:38.496
Been I.D.-ing
every person and car

20:38.498 --> 20:40.331
in or around Angelo Brocato's

20:40.333 --> 20:42.233
around the time
of the baker's murder.

20:42.235 --> 20:44.168
Nothing came up until...

20:44.170 --> 20:47.505
We matched the license plate
to a silver Toyota 4Runner

20:47.507 --> 20:49.207
reported stolen two days ago
driving by.

20:49.209 --> 20:50.741
9:33 p.m.

20:50.743 --> 20:52.309
Could be a coincidence, or...

20:52.311 --> 20:54.044
Could be our operatives.
Good work.

20:54.046 --> 20:57.147
I'll put a BOLO out,
notify LSP and FBI, too.

20:57.149 --> 20:58.882
Should we trigger EAS,
go wide?

20:58.884 --> 21:00.750
I mean, it's just...
No, no, no, no, no.

21:00.752 --> 21:02.819
The media gets ahold of this
and puts it out there,

21:02.821 --> 21:04.587
could cause a panic
that the virus

21:04.589 --> 21:06.323
is gonna spread
beyond the base.

21:06.325 --> 21:09.526
Make it all that more difficult
to find our operatives.

21:09.528 --> 21:11.060
Well, the health department
already knows.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.796
They quarantined Wade's morgue.

21:12.798 --> 21:14.798
It's just a matter of time
before the media finds out.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.399
Yep, and stokes
public fear.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.902
We have to keep this contained.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.139
Only one way to do that.

21:25.977 --> 21:27.910
Let me know
when you find that car.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.578
Where's he going?

21:29.580 --> 21:32.448
I bet it's the last place
he wants to go.

21:36.821 --> 21:39.088
You got stones, Dwayne,
I'll give you that much.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.224
Last thing we both need is for
the media to get ahold of this.

21:42.226 --> 21:44.693
They've already contacted
my office, more than once.

21:44.695 --> 21:48.229
Media hysteria is not gonna help
me find out who's responsible.

21:48.231 --> 21:49.965
In fact, it'll hurt the cause.

21:49.967 --> 21:54.402
I got a lead, just need
a day or two, maybe less.

21:54.404 --> 21:56.905
Still, I couldn't very
well lie to the people.

21:56.907 --> 21:59.074
I wouldn't be a very good mayor
if I did, now would I?

21:59.076 --> 22:02.143
Apparently the Office of Public
Health is getting calls, too.

22:02.145 --> 22:05.080
They're asking for an
official statement.

22:05.082 --> 22:08.016
And by the way,
how's Loretta doing?

22:10.954 --> 22:14.589
Real shame, isn't it?

22:14.591 --> 22:17.024
So, what?

22:17.026 --> 22:19.393
You're gonna make this personal,
is that it?

22:19.395 --> 22:21.696
This is about trying
to stop an outbreak,

22:21.698 --> 22:23.764
saving innocent people;
this isn't about us, Hamilton.

22:23.766 --> 22:25.199
The hell it's not about us.

22:25.201 --> 22:28.135
Everything's about us
since Garcia.

22:28.137 --> 22:30.037
You may not see this,
Dwayne, but the truth is

22:30.039 --> 22:32.907
we both want the same thing:
what's good for this city.

22:32.909 --> 22:35.042
The only problem
is that you think

22:35.044 --> 22:36.943
that bringing me down
is the best way to do that,

22:36.945 --> 22:38.578
and I can't allow
that to happen.

22:38.580 --> 22:42.182
So what do you want?

22:42.184 --> 22:45.352
I want whatever you got on me.

22:45.354 --> 22:47.287
Whatever you <i>think</i> you got.

22:47.289 --> 22:48.622
Vis-à-vis Garcia.

22:48.624 --> 22:49.990
Sounds like an admission to me.

22:49.992 --> 22:51.190
Not admitting anything.

22:51.192 --> 22:53.393
I just want you off my
back once and for all.

22:53.395 --> 22:55.461
So you're threatening
to impede my investigation,

22:55.463 --> 22:58.865
risk causing widespread fear
just to cover your own ass?

22:58.867 --> 23:00.366
You're the one
doing the threatening,

23:00.368 --> 23:01.968
and I'm not gonna stand for it,

23:01.970 --> 23:03.603
not anymore,
even if it means getting you

23:03.605 --> 23:05.639
and your whole damn team
kicked out of New Orleans.

23:05.641 --> 23:07.473
NCIS is federal.

23:07.475 --> 23:10.076
You don't have the power
or the jurisdiction...

23:10.078 --> 23:11.911
Oh, man, jurisdiction
doesn't mean anything

23:11.913 --> 23:13.846
if you got connections.

23:13.848 --> 23:16.215
And me and SECDEF go way back,

23:16.217 --> 23:17.583
believe me.

23:17.585 --> 23:20.119
Apparently, there's
something called

23:20.121 --> 23:21.421
a mobility agreement.

23:21.423 --> 23:22.988
Says that if
Navy brass thinks

23:22.990 --> 23:25.290
NCIS and the city
aren't getting along,

23:25.292 --> 23:28.160
well, they can re-assign
you to God knows where.

23:29.463 --> 23:32.031
Gloves are off, Dwayne.

23:32.033 --> 23:33.966
You want my help, hmm?

23:33.968 --> 23:36.134
Cooperation?
That only happens

23:36.136 --> 23:39.704
you get me everything you got
on Garcia by this time tomorrow.

23:39.706 --> 23:41.540
Understand?

23:47.948 --> 23:49.981
We didn't get a BOLO hit,

23:49.983 --> 23:52.517
but Patton's been tracking
satellite radio signals

23:52.519 --> 23:54.052
from every 4Runner in the area,

23:54.054 --> 23:55.387
when one suddenly vanished.

23:55.389 --> 23:57.488
I think we just found it.
Gregorio.

23:57.490 --> 23:59.190
Look at this.
What is it?

23:59.960 --> 24:02.293
I'm pretty sure it's Lopez.

24:04.931 --> 24:06.497
Lopez is inside, Pride.

24:06.499 --> 24:08.332
She's dead.

24:08.334 --> 24:10.434
Must've caught her
investigating.

24:10.436 --> 24:12.436
Two more in the backseat.

24:12.438 --> 24:15.539
Wait. Two more?

24:15.541 --> 24:18.041
Who are they?

24:18.043 --> 24:21.545
I just got DNA I.D.s
on both victims,

24:21.547 --> 24:24.515
but I'm afraid you're
not gonna like this.

24:24.517 --> 24:26.617
They're marines.

24:26.619 --> 24:28.785
I'm sending the files
to you now.

24:30.422 --> 24:32.956
Loretta, you have
to lie down.

24:32.958 --> 24:34.591
We've been through this, Dwayne.

24:34.593 --> 24:37.694
We both know I'm not the only
one running out of time.

24:37.696 --> 24:41.297
Wait a second,
those aren't just any marines.

24:41.299 --> 24:43.233
All right? They're part of
a Biological Response Force

24:43.235 --> 24:44.735
that was headed
for Belle Chasse.

24:44.737 --> 24:46.469
Wait,
operatives killed Lopez

24:46.471 --> 24:48.471
because she was investigating
them-- that much I get.

24:48.473 --> 24:50.673
But why intercept and kill
the other two?

24:50.675 --> 24:52.808
Try to keep them
from stopping the outbreak?

24:52.810 --> 24:54.677
Hold on.
According to the Belle Chasse

24:54.679 --> 24:57.013
entry log,
Corporals Davis and Lin

24:57.015 --> 24:59.715
just checked in at the main gate
along with their unit.

24:59.717 --> 25:01.317
So operatives
must have snuck in,

25:01.319 --> 25:02.752
killed them while
they were traveling

25:02.754 --> 25:04.319
with the marine convoy.

25:04.321 --> 25:07.089
But they did all that
just to steal their I.D.s?

25:07.091 --> 25:08.658
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

25:08.660 --> 25:11.393
I mean, if they're with the
people that infected the base,

25:11.395 --> 25:12.962
that'd be the last place
they'd want to go.

25:12.964 --> 25:13.963
Dwayne.

25:13.965 --> 25:15.464
I know, I know.

25:15.466 --> 25:16.999
Sebastian's at Belle Chasse

25:17.001 --> 25:18.500
waiting for the Response Force.

25:18.502 --> 25:20.969
Which means he has no idea
who those people really are.

25:22.139 --> 25:24.005
<i>You guys from</i>
<i>the Response Force?</i>

25:24.841 --> 25:26.841
Yeah. Lance Corporal Lin, Davis.

25:26.843 --> 25:28.544
Rest of the team's on its way.

25:28.546 --> 25:30.212
Who are you?
NCIS, Forensic Agent Lund.

25:30.214 --> 25:32.181
I'm here to figure out
how this all happened,

25:32.183 --> 25:34.349
but more importantly,
how we can stop it.

25:34.351 --> 25:35.817
Come on,
let's get geared up.

25:37.554 --> 25:38.787
Straight to voice mail.

25:38.789 --> 25:39.921
We got to get to the base.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.290
Christopher, keep calling

25:42.292 --> 25:44.125
Sebastian on his cell.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.326
I'll call ONI.

25:45.328 --> 25:46.360
Gregorio,

25:46.362 --> 25:48.029
get the base police

25:48.031 --> 25:49.297
to secure Belle Chasse,

25:49.299 --> 25:51.265
put the gates on high alert.

25:51.267 --> 25:55.336
Loretta, I'll call you as soon
as we know anything, promise.

26:01.344 --> 26:02.710
Hey! Dr. Wade!

26:18.199 --> 26:20.400
Last antibiotic
isn't working, either.

26:20.402 --> 26:21.567
Get me carbapenem, stat.

26:21.569 --> 26:22.835
Let's intubate her.

26:22.837 --> 26:25.504
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, people.

26:25.506 --> 26:28.674
If we want to save her,
we've got to stabilize her.

26:28.676 --> 26:31.710
Is she conscious, talking?

26:31.712 --> 26:33.512
All right, you tell her
to take care

26:33.514 --> 26:35.748
and that we're out here doing
everything we can on our end.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.583
Thank you.
How's Wade?

26:37.585 --> 26:39.785
Thinking about putting her
in a medically induced coma

26:39.787 --> 26:41.853
to slow her metabolism,
buy time.

26:41.855 --> 26:43.656
How much time
she have?

26:43.658 --> 26:45.223
Not much.
Agent Pride.

26:45.225 --> 26:46.925
I'm Captain Rogers,
Base Commanding Officer here.

26:46.927 --> 26:48.694
Any luck finding my agent?

26:48.696 --> 26:51.163
Not yet, but it's a large base;
we're still searching.

26:51.165 --> 26:53.899
But we're under full lockdown,
every access point guarded.

26:53.901 --> 26:55.500
Operatives won't
be able to escape

26:55.502 --> 26:57.269
without going through us.
Okay, well, the problem is

26:57.271 --> 26:58.703
we got to take them alive.

26:58.705 --> 27:00.704
They may be the only ones
with an antidote.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.039
Still can't
reach Sebastian, King.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.740
Why would he
turn off his phone?

27:03.742 --> 27:05.810
He wouldn't.

27:05.812 --> 27:09.213
Is there a secure area on base
where cell phones are jammed?

27:09.215 --> 27:10.547
Yes, there is.

27:10.549 --> 27:12.149
Commander Downey,
Naval Intelligence.

27:12.151 --> 27:13.650
We spoke earlier. Follow me.
Yes, sir.

27:13.652 --> 27:15.085
Looks like
we finally got clearance.

27:15.087 --> 27:16.753
Hopefully. Better
late than never.

27:16.755 --> 27:19.289
I'll download you on the way.
I got a vehicle.

27:23.429 --> 27:25.161
I still
don't know why we're here

27:25.163 --> 27:26.863
or why we're wearing
protective gear.

27:26.865 --> 27:28.565
P.O. Campbell's blood
particulates could be anywhere.

27:28.567 --> 27:29.966
Yeah, but the area's
already been cleared.

27:29.968 --> 27:31.635
What we need to be doing
is testing the infected

27:31.637 --> 27:33.336
for resistant antibodies.

27:33.338 --> 27:35.571
This is our jurisdiction,
Agent Lund,

27:35.573 --> 27:37.773
not yours.

27:37.775 --> 27:41.010
There a problem?
No. Everything's good.

27:41.012 --> 27:42.745
All right. Check for
residual contamination

27:42.747 --> 27:44.147
out here, we'll check inside.

27:44.149 --> 27:46.282
Let's go.

28:09.874 --> 28:11.874
Crap.

28:17.915 --> 28:21.016
We think the biological attack
was really just a diversion

28:21.018 --> 28:22.817
to get the operatives on base.

28:22.819 --> 28:24.952
By killing
the Marine Response Force.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.188
Because they knew they'd be
the first ones called in,

28:27.190 --> 28:28.189
Navy 911.

28:28.191 --> 28:29.524
Exactly.

28:29.526 --> 28:31.926
But to do what?
Why go through all this?

28:31.928 --> 28:33.661
Smokescreen?
Probably.

28:33.663 --> 28:35.563
Best way to breach
a highly-secure area:

28:35.565 --> 28:37.098
create widespread panic.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.700
Commander Lopez's team

28:38.702 --> 28:42.169
was installing secure cables
to what D.O.D. had hoped

28:42.171 --> 28:44.038
would become the first
ship activation center

28:44.040 --> 28:46.507
east of San Diego.
Ship activation?

28:46.509 --> 28:48.542
You have to understand
how Navy ships work.

28:48.544 --> 28:50.311
They're basically just
floating hunks of metal

28:50.313 --> 28:51.779
until they're programmed
into warships.

28:51.781 --> 28:54.315
<i>It's a highly classified</i>
<i>procedure,</i>

28:54.317 --> 28:56.850
and the hope was this base
could expand our reach.

28:56.852 --> 28:58.251
The more ships activated,

28:58.253 --> 29:00.020
the more the Chinese
have to contend with.

29:00.022 --> 29:01.154
They don't want that to happen.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.089
At all costs, apparently.

29:03.091 --> 29:04.558
So what do they want?

29:04.560 --> 29:06.493
How do they expect to stop
the programming?

29:06.495 --> 29:08.629
Steal the ship activation CPU

29:08.631 --> 29:10.531
and all the stored Intel.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.033
Make D.O.D. lose faith
in Belle Chasse.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.257
Sebastian.

30:18.798 --> 30:20.264
Get down, get down!

30:23.736 --> 30:25.470
All right, check on Sebastian.

30:25.472 --> 30:27.438
Alert the gate.
We need them taken alive.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.107
Let's go!
Suspects headed to main gate.

30:29.109 --> 30:33.111
Capture, do not kill.
Repeat, capture, do not kill.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.587
Now.

30:43.589 --> 30:46.289
Deploy the spike strip!
Go, go, go!

30:58.904 --> 31:01.171
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!

31:01.173 --> 31:04.441
Stop shooting! There's nowhere
to go; you're surrounded!

31:04.443 --> 31:06.643
Hands out the window, now.

31:08.079 --> 31:10.379
Do it now!

31:10.381 --> 31:12.048
Outside the window,
slow!

31:17.022 --> 31:18.721
No, no, no.

31:38.225 --> 31:41.742
Understood. Please, though,
just do everything you can.

31:41.912 --> 31:44.212
I should have known the moment
I saw that those operatives

31:44.214 --> 31:45.851
didn't tape up their wrists--
I don't know how I missed it.

31:45.852 --> 31:49.086
Sebastian, you did your best.
You-you followed them,

31:49.088 --> 31:50.797
you engaged them.
You-you were outgunned.

31:50.821 --> 31:51.590
That's not what I mean.

31:51.591 --> 31:53.258
I mean, I knew that they were
bad guys, it just didn't

31:53.260 --> 31:54.992
occur to me that the only reason
they weren't afraid

31:54.994 --> 31:57.462
of being infected was
'cause they had been inoculated.

31:57.464 --> 31:59.229
The antidote was already
in their system.

31:59.231 --> 32:00.698
I should've
figured that out sooner.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.033
Wouldn't have
made any difference.

32:02.035 --> 32:04.401
They weren't gonna
be taken alive.

32:04.403 --> 32:06.570
They're trained
to protect state secrets.

32:06.572 --> 32:08.405
All right?
No matter the cost.

32:08.407 --> 32:11.241
Sebastian, hey,
can you duplicate it?

32:11.243 --> 32:13.778
I'm-I'm trying to separate
the antibodies right now,

32:13.780 --> 32:16.413
but Wade doesn't
have that much time.

32:16.415 --> 32:19.049
Hey, King, Patton may have
found something

32:19.051 --> 32:20.717
off the activation CPU...

32:20.719 --> 32:22.085
I don't care about the case
right now, Christopher.

32:22.087 --> 32:24.154
It's not about the case,
it's about Wade.

32:24.156 --> 32:26.323
We found the CPU hooked up
to the docking station

32:26.325 --> 32:27.724
in the operative's van.

32:27.726 --> 32:29.359
They were uploading it
to someone while we were

32:29.361 --> 32:31.494
chasing them.
Yeah, someone off-site.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.529
They must've knew they weren't
getting out of there alive.

32:33.531 --> 32:35.198
But they still wanted
to transfer the Intel

32:35.200 --> 32:36.632
to whoever
they were working for,

32:36.634 --> 32:37.867
probably the handler.

32:37.869 --> 32:39.069
Can you trace the signal?

32:39.071 --> 32:40.336
That's why we're calling.

32:40.338 --> 32:42.138
Tracking down
the receiver's I.P. address,

32:42.140 --> 32:43.372
vectoring the location.
Stand by.

32:43.374 --> 32:44.507
Pride, if we can
find the handler...

32:44.509 --> 32:45.875
There's a good chance
he might have

32:45.877 --> 32:47.310
the antidote on him
as a precaution.

32:47.312 --> 32:48.777
Got it, sending it now.

32:48.779 --> 32:50.779
Alferd Supply
in Chalmette.

32:50.781 --> 32:52.515
We'll meet you there.

33:08.199 --> 33:10.064
NCIS! Get your hands up!

33:10.700 --> 33:12.900
Federal agents! Don't move!

33:13.669 --> 33:15.203
Hey!

33:21.745 --> 33:23.344
Cyanide.

33:23.346 --> 33:25.813
Clear.
Okay. Start searching everywhere.

33:25.815 --> 33:28.115
That antidote's
got to be here somewhere.

33:28.117 --> 33:30.150
So we're not
wasting time here.

33:30.152 --> 33:31.885
You are under arrest for murder,

33:31.887 --> 33:34.187
terrorism, espionage.

33:34.189 --> 33:35.623
But I don't care
about any of that.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.658
All I want is to get
the antidote to the virus.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.426
Virus? What virus?

33:39.428 --> 33:40.761
You do not want
to mess with me right now,

33:40.763 --> 33:41.995
do you understand that?

33:41.997 --> 33:43.363
My friend is dying
because of you,

33:43.365 --> 33:44.397
and if you don't
help me save her...

33:44.399 --> 33:46.266
I'm not afraid to die.

33:47.069 --> 33:48.568
No?

33:49.671 --> 33:51.404
Not quickly, maybe, but...

33:51.406 --> 33:53.439
how about slowly?

33:55.010 --> 33:57.744
Painfully,
like all your victims.

34:00.982 --> 34:03.683
You know, uh,
injecting the baker

34:03.685 --> 34:05.718
directly with
the virus...

34:11.092 --> 34:14.260
...that must've made his death
that much more excruciating.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.061
His brain probably
swelled up immediately,

34:16.063 --> 34:18.463
lungs filled with blood,
drowning him,

34:18.465 --> 34:20.364
convulsions.

34:22.703 --> 34:24.569
You can't do this.

34:27.474 --> 34:30.242
He can't, but I can.

34:30.244 --> 34:32.844
And there's nobody's
here to stop me.

34:32.846 --> 34:35.447
No, wait! The table!

34:35.449 --> 34:37.949
The antidote's
under the card table!

34:39.052 --> 34:40.918
Got it.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.422
All right, get it to the
base and Loretta. Hurry!

34:44.425 --> 34:46.391
Sebastian.

34:46.393 --> 34:48.059
Were you really
gonna inject him?

34:48.061 --> 34:50.228
For her, yeah.

34:50.230 --> 34:52.730
Get going.

34:55.068 --> 34:57.401
What now?

34:57.403 --> 34:58.803
Now we're gonna book you.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.104
We got a treasure trove

35:00.106 --> 35:01.940
of incriminating evidence
against you.

35:01.942 --> 35:05.109
Probably the only way
to get out of the death penalty

35:05.111 --> 35:07.277
is if you admit
to who you're working for.

35:07.279 --> 35:09.613
You're not getting that
out of me.

35:09.615 --> 35:11.582
Well, I don't think it's us
you got to worry about.

35:11.584 --> 35:14.752
Oh, no, that's NSA
and DHS territory,

35:14.754 --> 35:16.954
but if my memory serves me,
Guantanamo...

35:21.561 --> 35:22.893
What the hell?

35:22.895 --> 35:24.962
Someone just shot him
through a friggin' brick wall!

35:31.203 --> 35:33.303
Okay.

35:45.316 --> 35:46.983
Bullet casing.

35:50.154 --> 35:51.855
Still warm.

35:53.191 --> 35:54.758
Is that .50 caliber?

35:54.760 --> 35:57.393
Not just any .50 caliber.

35:57.395 --> 35:58.827
Penetrates through a brick wall

35:58.829 --> 36:00.863
without line of sight
and still hits its target?

36:00.865 --> 36:04.533
It's got to be DARPA,
thermal scope, heat seeking.

36:04.535 --> 36:06.135
Must have been another operative

36:06.137 --> 36:08.570
who wanted to make sure
that this one didn't talk.

36:08.572 --> 36:10.973
Except I don't think
the operative was Chinese.

36:10.975 --> 36:12.974
This is U.S. technology, Pride.

36:12.976 --> 36:14.943
It's brand-new, too.

36:14.945 --> 36:18.313
Which means whoever did this
had to be homegrown American.

36:27.525 --> 36:29.891
Knock, knock.

36:29.893 --> 36:31.393
Hey!
Hey.

36:33.030 --> 36:35.030
How you feeling?

36:36.333 --> 36:38.333
That's sort of
a stupid question, I know.

36:38.335 --> 36:40.435
I'm sorry. It's--
I-I don't know how to act

36:40.437 --> 36:41.869
in situations like this.
I mean, obviously,

36:41.871 --> 36:43.471
after everything
you've been through,

36:43.473 --> 36:45.372
you're not feeling great,
but at the same time,

36:45.374 --> 36:47.174
I don't know what I'm...
Sebastian.

36:47.176 --> 36:49.109
Just ask me again.

36:49.111 --> 36:50.645
How you feeling?

36:50.647 --> 36:52.713
I feel like crap.

36:53.716 --> 36:56.551
But I'm alive and I'll take it,
thanks to you.

36:56.553 --> 36:58.252
Thanks to me? No, I can't...

36:58.254 --> 36:59.587
Oh, don't even go there.

36:59.589 --> 37:01.855
Pride already told me
what you did.

37:01.857 --> 37:03.757
Said you saved my life.

37:03.759 --> 37:05.259
I mean...

37:05.261 --> 37:07.161
I didn't, you know.

37:07.163 --> 37:08.395
Not really.
Not by myself.

37:08.397 --> 37:10.064
It was sort of, like, a group...
Come here.

37:10.066 --> 37:11.298
Want to give you a hug.

37:12.935 --> 37:15.169
Mm.

37:15.171 --> 37:17.271
Thank you.

37:17.273 --> 37:18.772
Anytime.

37:22.678 --> 37:24.811
I'm proud of you,
Sebastian.

37:24.813 --> 37:28.448
You faced your fears.

37:28.450 --> 37:32.185
You risked your life
to save others.

37:32.187 --> 37:35.388
I heard you even
threatened to go a little rogue.

37:35.390 --> 37:36.722
That's what I heard.

37:36.724 --> 37:39.125
Yeah, well, you know.

37:39.127 --> 37:41.294
Guess that means I'm finally
becoming a real agent.

37:41.296 --> 37:42.328
No.

37:42.330 --> 37:46.432
Means you're finally
becoming yourself.

37:59.614 --> 38:01.146
Hey.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.948
Am I interrupting?

38:02.950 --> 38:04.583
No.

38:04.585 --> 38:06.619
No. What's up?
Just thought you'd like to know

38:06.621 --> 38:08.387
I checked with the medic
at Belle Chasse.

38:08.389 --> 38:10.122
Everyone's recovering.

38:10.124 --> 38:13.825
Good. Good.

38:13.827 --> 38:17.195
Kind of a major whirlwind
last couple of days, huh?

38:17.197 --> 38:19.431
I still can't believe
everything that happened.

38:19.433 --> 38:22.134
And everything
that almost happened.

38:22.136 --> 38:24.268
Right? So strange, though.

38:24.270 --> 38:25.770
All that goes down
all the time,

38:25.772 --> 38:27.772
public never even
knows about it.

38:27.774 --> 38:30.374
Not easy keeping it
that way sometimes.

38:35.348 --> 38:37.415
Something else?

38:37.417 --> 38:38.650
Yeah.

38:38.652 --> 38:41.185
I, uh, got a
partial fingerprint

38:41.187 --> 38:44.788
on the .50 caliber cartridge
that killed our handler.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.190
You get an I.D.?
No.

38:46.192 --> 38:47.591
But I think you'll
find this interesting.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.227
Turns out the print
matches the partial

38:50.229 --> 38:54.031
Sebastian lifted off of Garcia's
detonator you guys found.

38:55.068 --> 38:56.233
Yep.

38:56.235 --> 38:58.468
Same person
killed both people.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.506
But wait.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.341
If that's true,
then that would mean...

39:05.343 --> 39:06.543
That would mean

39:06.545 --> 39:08.378
the killer's working
for Mayor Hamilton,

39:08.380 --> 39:09.713
which also means

39:09.715 --> 39:11.648
Hamilton could be
behind both killings.

39:11.650 --> 39:12.849
And, if so,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.650
whatever the good mayor
is up to

39:14.652 --> 39:16.519
is a lot bigger than we thought.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.223
No wonder he's trying
to threaten us.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.599
You're late, Dwayne.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.200
Thought you weren't
gonna show.

39:31.202 --> 39:34.403
Wouldn't want to
disappoint you, Mr. Mayor.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.739
Good, I'm glad.

39:36.741 --> 39:38.340
That for me?

39:40.878 --> 39:42.511
Yeah.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.551
Whoa, wait, wait.
Wh-What is this?

39:50.988 --> 39:54.022
I told you I wanted everything
you had on Garcia's murder.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.357
I remember.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.212
Gloves are off.

40:01.683 --> 40:03.549
Your words.
