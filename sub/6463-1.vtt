have been brainwashed.

Could have turned.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.254
Evidently she did.

With due respect, sir,

04:58.423 --> 05:00.883
I played your war games

only got killed once.

05:00.968 --> 05:01.968

You've forgotten
the land mine on
the Black Sea beach.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.014
Correction, sir.
I lost both legs.
I did not die.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.891
You were immobilized.

gives you an edge.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.989
But is your edge
sharp enough?

05:23.073 --> 05:25.491
That's the difference
between a double-0
and a corpse.

05:25.575 --> 05:29.954
Since you took over, sir,
you've had little use
for the double-0's.

that's your problem.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.598
Free radicals, sir?

05:49.683 --> 05:53.102
Yeah, they're toxins
that destroy the body
and the brain.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.563
Caused by eating
too much red meat
and white bread

05:55.647 --> 05:57.690
and too many dry martinis.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.317
Then I shall cut out
the white bread, sir.

I've never yet found

I will choose France.

with his laser beam
will score a point.

another way to win.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:07.012

you control two
nuclear missiles.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.933
With your right hand,
you control a shield
to block my missiles.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:15.103
But if you fail...
Boom, I win the game.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:17.731

I will be blue.

02:08:32.455 --> 02:08:33.830
DOMINO: There you are.

02:08:33.915 --> 02:08:36.041
I always have
a martini at 5:00.

02:08:36.125 --> 02:08:39.461
(CHUCKLING) You'll never
give up your old habits,
James.

02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:43.131
No, you're wrong.
Those days are over.

02:08:48.304 --> 02:08:49.513
(GATE CREAKING)

02:09:15.498 --> 02:09:16.998
(YELLING)

02:09:23.714 --> 02:09:24.923
Oh, no.

02:09:25.842 --> 02:09:27.426
I'm sorry, Mr. Bond.

02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:29.261
Obviously caught you
at a bad moment.

02:09:29.345 --> 02:09:30.929
M sent you.

02:09:31.013 --> 02:09:33.181
Only to plead
for your return, sir.

02:09:33.266 --> 02:09:35.392
M says that
without you in
the service,

02:09:35.476 --> 02:09:38.603
he fears for the
security of the
civilized world.

02:09:38.688 --> 02:09:40.063
Never again.

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:42.315
Never?

02:09:42.567 --> 02:09:45.318
(SINGING)
Never say never again

02:09:45.403 --> 02:09:49.156
Never, never say never again

02:10:08.342 --> 02:10:11.970
You walk in a room

02:10:12.054 --> 02:10:15.474
A woman can feel the heat

02:10:15.808 --> 02:10:18.852
One look is a guarantee

02:10:18.936 --> 02:10:23.356
Nights could be
long and sweet

02:10:23.441 --> 02:10:26.359
The message is clear

02:10:26.694 --> 02:10:30.655
Like nothing I've ever known

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:34.075
But from all that I hear

02:10:34.494 --> 02:10:37.412
Forget about long-range plans

02:10:37.497 --> 02:10:41.875
'Cause this man's got his own

02:10:41.959 --> 02:10:45.712
To get mixed up with

02:10:45.796 --> 02:10:49.508
A man who says never

02:10:50.927 --> 02:10:57.307
May be big trouble, but then

02:10:57.517 --> 02:11:04.481
I just could be
the woman to take you

02:11:05.358 --> 02:11:10.487
And make you
never say never again

02:11:10.571 --> 02:11:14.199
Never, never say never again

02:11:14.283 --> 02:11:17.911
Never, never say never again

02:11:17.995 --> 02:11:21.623
Never, never say never again

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:25.502
Never, never say never again

02:11:25.586 --> 02:11:28.964
You've got all the moves

02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:32.759
Oh, but, baby, I got them, too

02:11:32.843 --> 02:11:37.597
No matter your attitude
or your mood

02:11:37.682 --> 02:11:40.392
I'll come through

02:11:40.476 --> 02:11:43.937
The touch of your voice

02:11:44.021 --> 02:11:47.649
The feel of your eyes on me

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:51.152
You leave me no choice

02:11:51.821 --> 02:11:54.573
Though I know
there's danger there

02:11:54.657 --> 02:11:59.077
I don't care, let it be

02:11:59.161 --> 02:12:02.789
To get in bed with

02:12:02.873 --> 02:12:06.668
A man who says never

02:12:07.878 --> 02:12:14.551
May have no future, but then

02:12:14.635 --> 02:12:21.558
I just could be
the woman to reach you

02:12:22.602 --> 02:12:28.023
And teach you to
never say never again

02:12:29.025 --> 02:12:32.652
I'll beg you
I'll get you

02:12:32.737 --> 02:12:36.406
I'll reach you
I'll teach you

02:12:36.490 --> 02:12:40.490
I'll take you
I'll make you
