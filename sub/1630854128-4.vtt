WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.658
Dr. Halstead, pharmacy
won't release the medication.

00:06.702 --> 00:07.790
I've got an idea.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.184
<i>There's
a region-wide shortage.</i>

00:10.227 --> 00:14.057
I can't have it
turning into the Wild West.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.798
I think we're already there.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.278
I'm a recovering addict.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.062
<i>I need to earn my reputation
back with everyone.</i>

00:19.106 --> 00:21.847
But with you, it doesn't feel
like that's ever gonna happen.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.110
<i>[tense music]</i>

00:23.153 --> 00:24.850
<i>You suffered a stroke.</i>

00:24.894 --> 00:29.072
If I can't operate again,
what does it matter?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
If it had been me
on the table,

00:30.639 --> 00:33.511
I'm pretty sure he would
have done the same thing.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.514
Hey.
Sorry I'm late, Dean.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.212
I don't know what was going on
with traffic today.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.691
I got caught up in it too.
You know,

00:39.735 --> 00:41.563
you can blame the HyperTrain
unveiling for that one.

00:41.606 --> 00:44.087
It shut down the Red Line.
A lot more people on the road.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.089
- HyperTrain?
- Yeah.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.222
You know,
Jack Dayton's new toy.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.527
Oh, yeah.

00:49.571 --> 00:52.313
Jack Dayton.
Right, Mr. Megabucks.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.880
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, genius.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.056
That HyperTrain is supposed

00:56.099 --> 00:57.622
to revolutionize
public transportation

00:57.666 --> 00:59.842
by moving twice the speed
of the L.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.149
Meanwhile, it takes
us schmucks in cars

01:02.192 --> 01:04.064
twice as long to get to work.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.457
How come Blake's locker
is empty?

01:06.501 --> 01:09.243
You hadn't heard?
Blake tendered her resignation.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.114
She's taking a job
at Brigham and Women's.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.247
- Boston?
- Uh-huh.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.467
Guess she's good enough
to perform surgery again.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.556
- When did all this happen?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.428
I got an email about it
last night.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.212
When is she leaving?
She can't leave.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.214
I need to talk to her.

01:24.258 --> 01:27.130
You probably
blame yourself, huh?

01:27.174 --> 01:29.567
No answer?

01:29.611 --> 01:31.613
[hangs up]
- Voicemail.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.310
All right.
I got to go talk to her.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.877
I'll be back in an hour, OK?
- All right.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.620
Just don't make it
any more than that.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.839
Hey, Candace.
I'm Dr. Asher.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.972
- Hi.
- All right.

01:43.015 --> 01:46.280
Well, it says in here
that you are at 28 weeks.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.456
- Mm-hmm.
- So how's your pregnancy been?

01:48.499 --> 01:51.241
You know,
it was going great,

01:51.285 --> 01:52.938
but my lower back
started hurting

01:52.982 --> 01:55.158
about a week ago,
this sharp pain.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.594
And it's only gotten worse.
- Mm-hmm.

01:56.638 --> 01:57.813
And I called my OB
this morning.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.423
And she told me
to come here right away.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.165
OK. Have you had any
abdominal pains, any cramping?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.601
No.
No, just my back.

02:03.645 --> 02:07.039
OK, CBC, CMP,
and urine cultures, please.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.215
Ooh.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.130
- You OK?
- No, no, no.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.132
It's good.
She's, um...

02:12.175 --> 02:15.091
She's kicking.
I'm sorry.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.789
I've had three miscarriages
over the last six years.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.966
And I'm alone right now with
my husband away on business,

02:21.010 --> 02:22.490
so I'm kind of on edge.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.274
Well,
that's totally understandable.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.668
Let's get your feet up here,
get you comfy.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.539
We'll put you
on a fetal heart rate monitor

02:28.583 --> 02:31.107
just to make sure that
that baby is happy and healthy.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.848
All right?
I'll be right back.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.328
Thank you.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.592
- Maggie, you're back.
- Hey.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.071
Yeah.
- How was your honeymoon?

02:39.115 --> 02:41.161
It was Paris, right?
- Mm-hmm.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.727

02:42.771 --> 02:44.164
Mm, nice.

Paris sounds so great.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.343

I have a passport.
I've just never used it.

Thank you.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.614
Dr. Asher.

02:59.657 --> 03:02.182
Just a reminder, you still need
to submit your urine sample

03:02.225 --> 03:04.488
for your weekly drug test.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.360
Right.
Of course.

03:06.403 --> 03:08.231
I've been doing it
the last six months now.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.102

you have a flailed chest

a hemopneumothorax, OK?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.361
What does that mean?

06:01.404 --> 06:02.840
He broke several ribs

06:02.884 --> 06:05.408
which is now causing
a free-floating segment.

His lung is likely collapsed,

Hey.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.378
Rose, Emmanuel,
this is Dr. Halstead.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.250
Hi. Sorry to hear
you're feeling poorly, Rose.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.209
Dr. Taylor thought
I might be able to help.

07:07.252 --> 07:10.560
The more, the merrier.
I'm well-accustomed to doctors.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.215
My wife has type 1 diabetes
and hypertension.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.565
But Rose is here today
because of a chronic UTI.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.307
Her internist prescribed her
several rounds of antibiotics,

07:18.350 --> 07:20.352
but none of them
have done anything.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.573
So I sent a urine test
with cultures.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.357
Mm-hmm.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.621
Multi-resistant
fungal infection.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.537
"Fungal" is such
an unpleasant word, isn't it?

07:30.580 --> 07:32.582
A lot of medical words are--

07:32.626 --> 07:34.454
phlegm, discharge.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.586
Rose taught
11th grade English composition

07:36.630 --> 07:37.718
for 32 years.

07:37.761 --> 07:38.980
Words are her thing.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.069
Some are
just naturally embarrassing,

07:41.112 --> 07:42.984
like having a fungus.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.465
Well, no need to be
embarrassed here, Rose.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.118
It says it's sensitive
to voriconazole

07:47.162 --> 07:48.729
and amphotericin only.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.731
So voriconazole.
200 milligrams. IV.

07:50.774 --> 07:54.212
Um, I had the same thought,
but there's a problem.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.388
- It's on the shortage list.
- For three weeks now.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.999
What about
this other medication?

07:58.042 --> 08:01.132
Let us talk it over.
We'll be right back.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.178
Amphotericin B is old-school.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.136
They call it amphoterrible.
- I know.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.964
And Rose's kidneys
are already compromised

08:07.008 --> 08:08.313
because of her diabetes.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.446
Her creatinine is 2.8 to start.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.622
Ampho will knock them out
and put her in dialysis,

08:12.666 --> 08:13.971
or worse,
kill her.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.582
It has to be voriconazole.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.540
Let's start calling around
hospitals, pharmacies,

08:17.584 --> 08:19.324
see if they have any.
- No, I already did.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.848
Everyone I talked to
in Chicago was out.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.066
I'm not sure
what the next move is,

08:22.110 --> 08:24.155
which is
why I dragged you into this.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.983
I mean, what do you do
if you can't get the only drug

08:26.027 --> 08:27.376
that'll treat an infection?

08:29.900 --> 08:32.033
The pain is localized
to her back.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.991
It says here
her UA is dirty.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.516
Yeah, that's not normal
for a urine dip,

08:36.559 --> 08:38.169
but it also doesn't scream
infection either.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.258
- Mm-hmm.
- I checked the shortage list,

08:40.302 --> 08:41.869
and I know that
the contrast dye supply is low.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.348
- It's currently restricted.
- Yes.

08:43.392 --> 08:46.221
But protocol also states
that if a patient needs a CT--

08:46.264 --> 08:48.005
OK, did you ultrasound her
for a kidney stone?

08:48.049 --> 08:50.355
- No.
- Why don't you?

08:50.399 --> 08:52.357
Kidney stones usually present
in pregnant women

08:52.401 --> 08:54.838
with peritonitis or flank pain.
- Right.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.231
Candace only
has low back pain.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.190
Sure. You can still
ultrasound her to check.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.192
I could,
but as we both know,

09:01.236 --> 09:03.238
ultrasound is not
very sensitive for a stone.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.805
A CT would give me
a much better picture

09:04.848 --> 09:06.371
of what's actually going on.
- OK.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.243
So if the ultrasound doesn't
show anything conclusive,

09:08.286 --> 09:10.071
you'll order the CT, yeah?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.161
- I'll do an ultrasound then.
- Right.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.685
And you might want to start her
on empiric antibiotics too.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.253
In case it's pyelonephritis,
you should get ahead of that.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.606
I mean, like,
it's perfectly natural

09:23.650 --> 09:27.610
for a teenager
to want distance from--

09:27.654 --> 09:30.570
from their parents, right?
But I don't know.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.224
Recently, it just seems like
she doesn't want anything

09:33.268 --> 09:36.880
to do with me at all anymore.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.882
That may only be temporary.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.492
And it's healthy
for your daughter

09:40.536 --> 09:42.190
to seek out
this kind of independence.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.192
You think that I, of all
people, wouldn't know that?

09:44.235 --> 09:45.846
But I don't know, man.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.587
It's been a...

09:47.630 --> 09:50.764
surprisingly difficult pill
to swallow, you know?

09:50.807 --> 09:53.418
And that kind of dovetails
with this other issue

09:53.462 --> 09:54.898
that I'm having at work, right,

09:54.942 --> 09:58.641
involving being there for
patients in difficult times.

09:58.685 --> 09:59.816
I mean, I'm used to living

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
in those uncomfortable moments, right?

10:01.688 --> 10:02.645
I mean, it's what we do.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.733
You know
what I'm talking about.

10:03.777 --> 10:04.734
You've been doing this
a long time.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.170
- Mm-hmm.
- But recently,

10:06.214 --> 10:09.130
when, say,
I have to give a patient,

10:09.173 --> 10:12.742
like, a really tough diagnosis, right,

10:12.786 --> 10:17.225
like, tell them
or the people that they love

10:17.268 --> 10:20.054
that they have
a lifelong mental illness--

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
Their lives are over.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.144
Yeah.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.103
And I've been haunted
by these moments, right?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.409
They stick with me.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.672
It's like sometimes
they stare back at me.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.152
Sometimes they cry.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.936
Sometimes they don't know
what to do, nor should they.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.634
But you know what?
Maybe I should.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.680
Dr. Greenwell?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
Please, go on.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.727
Are you all right?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.033
My chest.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.209
[labored breathing]

10:45.253 --> 10:48.038
I think--I think I might
be having a heart attack.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.173
Dr. Greenwell! Otis!

10:52.216 --> 10:54.088
Dr. Greenwell?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.353
Dr. Greenwell?

10:58.396 --> 11:01.138
- What do we got?
- Otis Greenwell, 52 years old.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.705
Collapsed
into a glass coffee table.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.054
EKG was normal.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.273
Multiple lacerations
to the forearm.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.666
We applied pressure dressings
en route

11:06.709 --> 11:07.536
and gave him an aspirin.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.798
He was having chest pains.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.104
Make sure he gets
a complete cardiac workup.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.366
Will do, Dr. Charles.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.673
I'll be right out here,
Dr. Greenwell, OK?

11:13.716 --> 11:14.848
He's a doctor?

11:14.891 --> 11:16.501
Yeah.
My therapist, in fact.

11:16.545 --> 11:19.679
So take good care of him, OK?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.593
Pulse is weak.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.553
He's likely in hemorrhagic
shock from all the blood loss.

11:24.596 --> 11:28.600
Please,
am I going to die?

11:28.644 --> 11:30.124
I'm gonna do everything
in my power

11:30.167 --> 11:31.734
to make sure
that doesn't happen, OK?

11:31.778 --> 11:32.953
All right.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.519
[distant creaking]

11:34.563 --> 11:36.173

Anyone in there?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.175
Yeah, yeah!
Hey, help us!

11:38.219 --> 11:40.003
Hey, Severide?

11:40.047 --> 11:41.962
Severide, is that you?

11:42.005 --> 11:43.572
It's Crockett!

11:43.615 --> 11:45.748
Crockett?
Hey, what's going on in there?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.054
What's the situation?

11:47.097 --> 11:49.143
There's three of us in here!

11:49.186 --> 11:51.754
Two of us are OK,
but the train's conductor,

11:51.798 --> 11:53.103
he's badly hurt.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.365
He's pretty shocky.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.976
This passageway
is too narrow.

11:56.019 --> 11:58.369
We'll try and widen it
and get a backboard through.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.110
It might take a while.
- No.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.547
No, listen to me.
We can't wait.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.463
I need you to get me
some supplies off the ambo,

12:05.507 --> 12:06.813
and I need you to call Med.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.554
I need them to send some things
you don't have.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.817
Copy that!

12:10.860 --> 12:13.210
Just hold tight, Crockett!

12:13.254 --> 12:15.212
Nathaniel
doesn't have that long.

12:15.256 --> 12:18.259
If we're gonna save him, we got
to do it right here, right now.

<i>[tense music]</i>

12:26.093 --> 12:28.051
People,
I don't have many details,

12:28.095 --> 12:30.837
but Crockett is down
in the tunnel

12:30.880 --> 12:32.752
trying to help those
who are injured.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.015
I do know that
he is in touch with CFD

12:35.058 --> 12:37.147
and appears to be safe
at this time.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.281
And I'll update you as soon
as I hear anything more.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.586
Thank you.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.503
Jeez.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.070
I hope he's OK.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.593
Yeah.

12:48.637 --> 12:49.769
Come on.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.818
[elevator dings]

12:55.862 --> 12:57.602
Ms. Goodwin, we were
just coming to find you.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.169
Do you have a second?
- Sure.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.997
My patient,
Rose Fremont,

13:01.041 --> 13:03.086
has a serious fungal infection
that needs treating.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.219
And the only drug
that can help her,

13:05.262 --> 13:08.396
voriconazole, is unavailable
all throughout Chicago.

13:08.439 --> 13:12.226
Well, could be just
another region-wide shortage.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.142
I'll reach out to our suppliers
out of state.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.840
The army, navy,
and national guard

13:17.884 --> 13:20.060
might be resources as well.

13:20.103 --> 13:23.324
Just do what you can for her
in the meantime.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.239
OK. She's gonna need pressors
to keep her blood pressure up.

13:25.282 --> 13:28.633
Speaking of the army,
I heard about your brother.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.854
Yeah, Jay needed a change.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.638
I think it'll be good for him.

13:33.682 --> 13:37.468
Ah.
Well, I know you two are close.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.774
I'll make those calls.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.432

13:50.351 --> 13:52.048

13:52.092 --> 13:53.920
OK, we won't
take that personally,

13:53.963 --> 13:55.138
but we'll still try
to get you back up

all right?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.968
OK, everyone.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.199
The faster
we can get this done,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.635
the faster you can leave,
Trey, all right?

14:13.678 --> 14:14.854
Just relax. Relax.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.517
Sorry, Ethan.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.128
There's a problem.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.913
I sent the last Pleur-evac
out to the tunnel collapse.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.088
Crockett requested it.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
- This is ridiculous.
- Relax, Kai.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.700
Dr. Marcel shouldn't
be putting a chest tube

14:35.744 --> 14:37.180
in someone
under those conditions anyway.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.965
It's not a sterile environment.
- Oh, really?

14:39.008 --> 14:40.836
You think I should have sent
him a note explaining that?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.142
So now our patient
needs a chest tube,

14:42.185 --> 14:44.057
and we can't connect it
to a drainage system.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.667
How is that supposed to work?

Remember?

14:48.322 --> 14:50.890
Oh, yeah.
I'll hit up central supply.

- Yeah, you want help?
- No, I'm good.

It's like riding a bike.

me what you're talking about?

Pay attention, Kai.
You might learn something.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.990
Mind if I join you?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.688
Candace, this is Dr. Archer,
Chief of the ED.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.081
He's been consulting
on your case.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.257
- How you doing, Candace?
- My back really hurts.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.867
Well, hopefully, that
won't be the case much longer,

15:11.911 --> 15:12.999
so bear with us.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.696
Was I right
about the kidney stones?

15:14.739 --> 15:16.002
I'm not seeing any stone,

15:16.045 --> 15:18.874
but I am seeing
some hydronephrosis

15:18.918 --> 15:20.267
on her left kidney.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.964
- Ah.
- What does that mean?

15:22.008 --> 15:24.749
Your kidney is not
draining effectively,

15:24.793 --> 15:26.012
so it's a little swollen.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.144
I'm concerned that
it might be infected,

15:28.188 --> 15:29.754
so it's a good thing
that Dr. Asher here

15:29.798 --> 15:31.495
has already started you
on antibiotics.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.757
Will it hurt the baby?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.716
The sooner we get ahead
of it, the better.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.545
Give her four of morphine
for the pain and call urology.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.764
Excuse us, Candace.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.856
We don't know for certain
that it's a kidney infection.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.249
If it walks like
a kidney infection

15:46.293 --> 15:47.729
and talks like
a kidney infection--

15:47.772 --> 15:50.166
Hydronephrosis is not
uncommon in pregnant women.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.081
When a uterus gets enlarged,
it can cause urine to back up

15:52.125 --> 15:53.213
and dilate the kidneys.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.910
It doesn't confirm
an infection.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.172
I appreciate
your determination

15:56.216 --> 15:57.913
to get a definitive diagnosis,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.784
but you are
overthinking this one.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.047
You know,
I just have this feeling

16:01.090 --> 16:02.526
that I'm never gonna
pass some test of yours.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.919
Oh, God.
All right.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.792
Look, I'm getting squeezed
by a lot of shortages,

16:07.836 --> 16:09.838
including contrast dye.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.057
And if the antibiotics
don't work

16:11.100 --> 16:12.972
and if her back pain
gets worse,

16:13.015 --> 16:15.844
then you can send her for a CT.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.281
[sighs]

16:20.283 --> 16:22.807
I removed the shards,
redressed his wounds.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.070
Did you
get his labs back yet?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.507
Yeah, he's not having an MI.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.205
Though his heart rate was
elevated when he came in,

16:29.249 --> 16:30.859
there's no sign
of a cardiac event at all.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.949
I mean, he's in good health,
but he said he's not sleeping.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.473
Huh.
Shoot me his chart.

16:36.517 --> 16:37.474
Yeah.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.741
[chuckles]
Well, this is awkward.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.308
Oh, come on.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.050
We're both doctors, Otis.
Stuff happens, right?

16:48.094 --> 16:49.878
But let's face it, Dan.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.662
I'm supposed to be
taking care of you.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.621
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of opportunity

16:53.664 --> 16:54.970
to do that,
all right?

16:55.014 --> 16:58.234
What do you think happened?
- I don't know.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.107
I just--
I must have passed out.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.631
- Happen before?
- No.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.980
Dr. Hudgins said

17:05.024 --> 17:07.287
that you were having
a hard time sleeping.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.767
Yeah. I haven't been
sleeping much recently, no.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.639
What would you say
to the idea

17:11.682 --> 17:16.209
that maybe what you had
was a little panic attack?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.994
Well, let's say that
it was a panic attack.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.563
I guess maybe it could
have been the result

17:22.606 --> 17:24.956
of a buildup of stressors.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.262

giving patients bad news

28:58.475 --> 28:59.781
when you were triggered.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.785
Yeah.

29:03.829 --> 29:08.616
I read journals all the time
to keep up, stay fresh.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.096
Uh-huh, OK.

29:10.139 --> 29:15.101
I recently read about
sporadic fatal insomnia, SFI.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.711
You heard of it?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.801
You know, I'm familiar
with familial fatal insomnia.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.760
It's a genetic
brain disorder, right?

29:21.803 --> 29:24.153
Yes.
SFI is a variant.

29:24.197 --> 29:27.809
It's nongenetic
and even more rare.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.812
It starts
with a mild inability to sleep

29:30.856 --> 29:33.249
that progressively worsens

29:33.293 --> 29:37.732
until it robs you of
your faculties and kills you.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.995
Right,
and so,

29:40.039 --> 29:41.605
you're concerned
that you might have this

29:41.649 --> 29:43.825
or that you're developing it?

29:43.869 --> 29:47.350
I know it's irrational,
but I--I can't help it.

29:47.394 --> 29:50.789
I'm really scared.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.443
Well, I mean, have you
thought about getting tested?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.837
No, I can't do that.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.534
Hey, a simple PET scan

29:57.578 --> 29:58.840
will tell you everything
you need to know.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.146
But that's the problem.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.802
If I test positive,
my life is over.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.848
Every last second I have
will be consumed by that.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.546
[voice breaks]
I won't be able to function.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.940
But, I mean, aren't you kind
of consumed by it already?

30:14.073 --> 30:15.726
[sobbing]
I'm so tired.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.772
Well, I mean,
of course you are.

30:19.687 --> 30:22.995
Look, have you thought about,
I don't know,

30:23.038 --> 30:26.563
what clarity might bring
to this scenario?

30:26.607 --> 30:29.392
Look, if you test negative,

30:29.436 --> 30:31.307
you get a good night's sleep,
right? That's easy.

30:31.351 --> 30:35.137
But even if you test positive,
which is unlikely,

30:35.181 --> 30:36.573
look, I mean,
it'd be difficult,

30:36.617 --> 30:39.881
but wouldn't it also kind of,
I don't know, inform

30:39.925 --> 30:42.275
how you want to spend the rest
of the time you had left?

30:42.318 --> 30:43.885
People you might want
to hang out with?

30:43.929 --> 30:45.756
The places
you might want to go?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.236
I don't know,
it just seems to me

30:47.280 --> 30:52.024
that there's an upside
to clarity both ways.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.769
I'll get the scan.

31:01.337 --> 31:04.732
Voriconazole,
the antifungal?

31:04.775 --> 31:07.126
Yeah, thought I'd check anyway.
Thank you.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.738
Will.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.914
Voriconazole.
200-milligrams. Tablets.

31:12.958 --> 31:16.004
I know it's an IV, but the
bioavailability is the same.

31:17.788 --> 31:18.964
Where'd you get them?

31:19.007 --> 31:22.489
It turns out
someone did have it.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.490
No.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.840
Will.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.929
These are the real deal
from a pharmacy.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.452
The prescription was filled
two months ago.

31:29.496 --> 31:31.846
Check the label. I've already
called and verified it.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.196
And your friend just happened
to have them?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.589
He said that sometimes

31:35.632 --> 31:36.851
people empty out
their medicine cabinets,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.244
and they turn over the contents
to him.

31:38.287 --> 31:39.680
That's how he got these.
- That's called diversion.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.421
It's a crime.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.423
Rose will likely die
from this infection.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.947
You know that.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.209
Even if you were
to give her these pills,

31:47.253 --> 31:48.732
how are you gonna explain it
in her chart?

31:48.776 --> 31:49.995
I don't know.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.867
I guess
we wouldn't put them in?

31:52.911 --> 31:55.000
She needs these pills, Will.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.919
There's only one way
to do this.

32:14.802 --> 32:15.977
No, no.
You stay here.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.289
Hey, Nancy.
Could you give us a moment?

32:23.332 --> 32:25.334
Sure.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.727
Thank you.

32:30.252 --> 32:33.516
Emmanuel,
I found some voriconazole.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.562
Oh, thank God.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.869
But I can't give it to Rose.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.393
- I don't understand.
- Yeah.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.569
The pills weren't acquired
through the proper channels.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.701
But I assure you, this is
the antifungal Rose needs.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.486
It will knock out
her infection.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.749
It will save her life.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.578
I just can't legally
give them to her,

32:51.621 --> 32:54.276
but you can.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.979
It's your decision.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.111
Dr. Taylor and I
cannot know about this.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.505
We'll check back

33:29.964 --> 33:33.533

only to be undone
by rusty old tracks

33:35.448 --> 33:37.406

33:37.450 --> 33:39.234
So it was the tunnel's fault?

It's not my train's.

Why are you down here,
Crockett?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.836
What do you mean?

34:15.879 --> 34:18.186
A train crashes,
and a tunnel collapses,

34:18.230 --> 34:20.623

34:20.667 --> 34:21.755
Why?

34:25.759 --> 34:27.804
I--I just did.

34:30.764 --> 34:34.550
You want to know
why I created this train?

34:34.594 --> 34:36.248
To change the world.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.640
Chicago first,
but soon,

34:37.684 --> 34:39.338

A hero.

That's the portrait I try
to paint for the media anyway.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.399
The truth is,
I developed this train

34:57.443 --> 34:58.792
to make me another fortune.

35:00.446 --> 35:02.926
Money and ego have
been the motivation

35:02.970 --> 35:05.407
behind almost every decision
I've ever made.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.019
Every good deed.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.460
Every good deed has
really been self-serving,

it turned out the way it did.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.738
But I think

36:15.782 --> 36:17.523
we should stop seeing
each other professionally,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.177
I'm afraid.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.352
I'm sorry,
but this has been

of therapeutic boundaries.

how difficult it is out there

to find a practitioner
who will just, you know,

36:50.425 --> 36:52.384
listen and talk
and be present?

36:52.427 --> 36:55.256

was the kind of,

36:55.300 --> 36:57.606

Well, hopefully,

Yeah, look.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.553
Yeah.

She left for Boston
this morning.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.731
I'm sending these things on
to her.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.561
I need to tell her something.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.432
Yeah, she saw you called.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.303
She didn't want to talk to you.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.264
I get it.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.484
Could you tell her something
for me?

39:59.527 --> 40:01.703
Just tell her

40:01.747 --> 40:04.358
I haven't been
entirely honest with her.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.926
Honest with myself, really.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.754
Oh?

40:08.797 --> 40:10.408

I mean, you said so yourself
when she was on the table.

40:15.108 --> 40:19.895
But I made the decision

40:24.509 --> 40:27.686

40:32.125 --> 40:36.085
But I guess I lost her anyway.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.696
I'm sorry.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.918
You take care, Ava.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.094
