      INSTEAD OF ASKING ME
  ALL THESE STUPID QUESTIONS,

04:46.706 --> 04:48.706
      YOU SHOULD REALLY BE
 ASKING YOURSELF IF THAT'S THE

       THEY WERE BOTH SO
 ATTRACTIVE...AND WELL-GROOMED.

09:16.751 --> 09:18.751
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:18.753 --> 09:20.686
          I'M TALKING
  ABOUT THAT LOUSY PUFF PIECE

09:20.688 --> 09:23.021
  THAT WE PAID BIG BUCKS FOR!

09:23.023 --> 09:25.089
     IT DIDN'T EVEN MENTION
          OUR BRANDS!

09:25.091 --> 09:26.723
      IT WAS JUST GARBAGE!

09:26.725 --> 09:28.124
      IT'S SIMPLY GARBAGE!

09:28.126 --> 09:29.158
WE WASTED OUR MONEY.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.060
ENOUGH ABOUT THE NEWS,

09:32.062 --> 09:33.861
              HUH?

09:33.863 --> 09:36.730
 WE'VE COME HERE TO TALK MONEY.

09:36.732 --> 09:39.165
- DID WE NOT?
- YES, YES, OF COURSE.

09:39.167 --> 09:42.601
 WE HAVE MORE PRESSING MATTERS
  THAT REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION.

09:42.603 --> 09:44.069
OH, WELL, LET'S PRESS.

09:46.139 --> 09:49.940
       ANY NEW IDEAS HERE
   HOW TO GET US FILTHY-RICH?

09:49.942 --> 09:51.775
LET'S NOT SKIMP ON THE "FILTHY."

09:51.777 --> 09:54.677
 LET'S NOT SKIMP ON THE "RICH."

09:54.679 --> 09:56.145
I GOT NOTHING
           RIGHT NOW.

09:56.147 --> 09:58.180
TOXIC WASTE DUMPS

09:58.182 --> 10:01.816
         IN THE MIDDLE
   OF CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUNDS.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.318
DARLINGS, DARLINGS!

10:04.320 --> 10:07.187
    I HAVE A FABULOUS IDEA.

10:07.189 --> 10:11.257
LIMITED-EDITION PANDA FUR COATS,

10:11.259 --> 10:17.028
        SUPER EXCLUSIVE,
  SUPER EXPENSIVE, TO DIE FOR.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.696
              NO?

10:18.698 --> 10:20.664
YEAH, YEAH.
  THIS IS GOOD, THIS IS GOOD.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.065
    I LIKE IT. I'M THINKING.

10:22.067 --> 10:23.066
 THE LIFTING OF THE WEIGHTS --

10:23.068 --> 10:24.667
   IT HELPS MY BRAIN LIKE --

10:24.669 --> 10:26.201
          OOH, I KNOW.

10:26.203 --> 10:30.872
 OKAY, WE ONLY MAKE THESE COATS
     IN EXTRA, EXTRA SMALL.

10:30.874 --> 10:33.040
        THIS WAY, ANYONE
    WHO WANTS TO WEAR THEM,

10:33.042 --> 10:35.208
THEY HAVE TO GO TO MY GYM FIRST

10:35.210 --> 10:38.644
           TO GET RID
 OF THEIR DISGUSTING BODY FAT!

10:38.646 --> 10:39.911
AND WE
       GET A PERCENTAGE.

10:42.715 --> 10:44.681
AND WHEN THAT DOESN'T
        WORK AT YOUR GYM

10:44.683 --> 10:46.182
   WHERE THEY LOSE THEIR FAT,

10:46.184 --> 10:52.254
     THOSE SUCKERS WILL BE
COMING TO ME FOR MY FIVE-MINUTE,

10:52.256 --> 10:54.089
        EASY-PEASY LIPO!

10:54.091 --> 10:56.624
LIPO!

10:58.127 --> 11:02.662
 GREG, FRANCINE, WHAT DO YOUSE
    BRING TO THE PARTY HERE?

11:02.664 --> 11:05.197
I WILL ABOLISH
        THAT RIDICULOUS,

11:05.199 --> 11:07.699
    ANTIQUATED MINIMUM WAGE

11:07.701 --> 11:12.369
   SO THAT WE CAN PRODUCE THE
GARMENTS AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE

11:12.371 --> 11:16.373
      FOR MAXIMUM PROFIT.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.242
AND I WILL GET
     ONE OF THE CELEBRITIES

11:19.244 --> 11:24.646
THAT I CREATED TO WEAR THE THING
AND POST IT ON ALL HER NETWORKS.

11:24.648 --> 11:26.114
   HER FOLLOWERS WILL GO WILD
            FOR IT.

11:26.116 --> 11:29.717
     SOMETHING I CALL "WEAR
          AND SHARE."

11:29.719 --> 11:31.752
"WEAR AND SHARE."
I CAN FEEL IT.

11:31.754 --> 11:33.253
    I'M JUST -- I'M JUST --

11:33.255 --> 11:34.354
    I'M JUST FEELING THAT --

11:34.356 --> 11:36.322
     THAT -- THAT FINAL 1%!

11:36.324 --> 11:38.724
    AND IT'S BEING FUNNELED
           RIGHT NOW

11:38.726 --> 11:41.226
INTO OUR BULGING BANK ACCOUNTS!

11:43.897 --> 11:45.096
TO THE 100%.

11:45.098 --> 11:49.934
- 100%!
- OUR 100%.

11:49.936 --> 11:51.702
WELL,
     I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

11:51.704 --> 11:54.371
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME.

11:54.373 --> 11:55.872
        I CAN'T OPERATE
  WITH THESE HANDS LIKE THIS.

11:55.874 --> 11:57.907
I CAN'T WORK ON SOMEBODY'S FACE.

11:57.909 --> 12:01.243
     I AM ABOUT AT THE END
        OF MY CALIPERS.

12:01.245 --> 12:05.013
        I'M TELLING YOU,
 THAT DAUGHTER OF MINE, CANDY,

12:05.015 --> 12:08.149
      SHE IS A NIGHTMARE.

12:08.151 --> 12:10.217
   I MEAN, TALK ABOUT A DRAIN
        ON THE FINANCES.

12:10.219 --> 12:12.052
  DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE?

12:12.054 --> 12:14.354
 DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
HAVE TO BRIBE EVERY SINGLE JUDGE

12:14.356 --> 12:17.323
       SO THAT DAMN BRAT
      CAN WIN EVERY PRIZE?

12:17.325 --> 12:19.291
DARLING,

12:19.293 --> 12:22.694
   THAT'S A WALK IN THE PARK
  COMPARED TO MY PETITE FREAK.

12:22.696 --> 12:24.896
          IF I'D KNOWN
  SHE'S GROW UP TO BE A GOTH,

12:24.898 --> 12:26.831
  I'D NEVER HAVE ADOPTED HER.

12:26.833 --> 12:30.734
    A WELL-GROOMED SHIH TZU
 MAKES A MUCH BETTER ACCESSORY.

12:30.736 --> 12:33.770
         AND EVEN WORSE
   THAN HER HUMILIATING LACK

12:33.772 --> 12:35.404
       OF FASHION SENSE,

12:35.406 --> 12:39.441
      THE LITTLE DO-GOODER
  KEEPS RELEASING MY ANIMALS.

12:39.443 --> 12:44.012
     I CANNOT HAVE MY FURS
    ESCAPING INTO THE NIGHT.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.948
YOU THINK I HAVE
          IT BAD, HUH?

12:46.950 --> 12:49.150
  I MEAN, MY PRECIOUS AVATARA

12:49.152 --> 12:53.187
    IS ABOUT TO BANKRUPT ME
 WITH HER ADDICTION TO NO-LIFE.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.155
       I CREATED THE GAME
  SO THAT I COULD MAKE MONEY,

12:55.157 --> 12:58.291
          NOT FOR HER
   TO SPEND MINE PLAYING IT.

12:58.293 --> 13:02.395
    AND AS FOR HER OBSESSION
    WITH GAINING FOLLOWERS,

13:02.397 --> 13:04.230
   IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

13:04.232 --> 13:06.098
      BUT -- BUT THAT'S --

13:06.100 --> 13:07.933
     IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE.
    YOU -- YOU HAVE NO IDEA

13:07.935 --> 13:11.102
         HOW MUCH MONEY
I'VE SPENT MAKING FAKE ACCOUNTS.

13:11.104 --> 13:14.905
         AND TO TOP IT
   ALL OFF...SHE'S A HIPSTER.

13:16.141 --> 13:18.141
YOU KNOW, GREG,

13:18.143 --> 13:21.144
       I'D PICK YOUR NERD
        OVER MY LITTLE,

13:21.146 --> 13:22.879
INSUFFERABLE DO-GOODER ANY DAY,

13:22.881 --> 13:25.214
PAL, 'CAUSE IT TAKES ONE LITTLE

13:25.216 --> 13:29.785
       RUNT WITH A HEART
  OF GOLD -- YEAH, MY GOLD --

13:29.787 --> 13:34.122
 AND HE SIPHONS MY HARD-EARNED
DIRTY MONEY EVERY DAY INTO WHAT?

13:34.124 --> 13:36.491
    SQUEAKY-CLEAN CHARITIES?
      ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:36.493 --> 13:39.494
     THEN HE GOES BLABBING
     TO THE COPS ABOUT ME?

13:39.496 --> 13:42.029
 DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I OWN?!

13:42.031 --> 13:45.198
       MOST OF THE POLICE
  IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW...

13:45.200 --> 13:46.265
OH?

13:46.267 --> 13:47.499
...I OWN.

13:47.501 --> 13:49.501
REALLY?

13:49.503 --> 13:51.369
WHAT?

13:51.371 --> 13:54.138
   I GOT TO GET SHAKEN DOWN?

13:54.140 --> 13:57.307
     I GOT TO SHELL OUT NOW
      TO THE ENTIRE FORCE?

13:57.309 --> 14:02.912
 DO YOU GRASP THE IMPLICATIONS
   OF THIS DILEMMA, WHAT WE--

14:02.914 --> 14:05.114
I DO.

14:05.116 --> 14:07.382
      YOU ARE IN A PICKLE.

14:07.384 --> 14:10.151
     BUT AT LEAST YOUR SON
          HAS A BMI --

14:10.153 --> 14:11.952
    THIS IS BODY MASS INDEX.

14:11.954 --> 14:14.554
   YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
 ABOUT -- IN THE NORMAL RANGE.

14:14.556 --> 14:16.355
HE'S LIKE NORMAL SON, YOU KNOW?

14:16.357 --> 14:20.258
      BOBBY -- MY BOBBY --
     HE'S AN EMBARRASSMENT.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.525
           I SAID IT.

14:21.527 --> 14:26.329
     HE IS A BLUBBERY BLOT
        ON MY GOOD NAME.

14:26.331 --> 14:29.398
      I STAND FOR FITNESS,
          NOT FATNESS.

14:29.400 --> 14:34.802
MY OLIVER,
    IN THE PAST MONTH ALONE,

14:34.804 --> 14:41.541
   THAT VICIOUS, LITTLE PEST
    HAS BEATEN UP SIX KIDS,

14:41.543 --> 14:43.442
    THREE ADULTS, COUNTLESS

14:43.444 --> 14:47.145
     SMALL ANIMALS, AND...

14:47.147 --> 14:51.315
26 PRICELESS INANIMATE OBJECTS.

14:51.317 --> 14:52.816
I'M SORRY.

14:52.818 --> 14:55.151
I'M ALL RIGHT.

14:55.153 --> 14:58.354
BETWEEN HOSPITAL BILLS, PAYOFFS,
       AND COMPENSATION,

14:58.356 --> 15:04.158
I HAVE HAD TO RAISE TAXES BY 53%
  JUST TO MAINTAIN MY SALARY.

15:04.160 --> 15:11.097
 IF THIS KEEPS UP, I MIGHT HAVE
 TO EVEN START TAXING THE RICH.

15:11.099 --> 15:12.998
I'M SORRY.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.433
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID RICH,

15:15.435 --> 15:17.168
- BUT THAT'S CRAZY.
- NO.

15:17.170 --> 15:18.936
IT'S A CATASTROPHE!

15:18.938 --> 15:22.572
WE GOT TO GET IT TIGHT, PEOPLE.

15:22.574 --> 15:24.473
  WE GOT TO PUT THESE PUPPIES
            TO BED.

15:24.475 --> 15:26.141
OBVIOUSLY,

15:26.143 --> 15:30.211
       WE HAVE TO GET RID
 OF EVERY STINKING ONE OF THEM.

15:30.213 --> 15:31.912
BUT HOW?

15:31.914 --> 15:37.217
           OH, WELL,
I MEAN WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE.

15:40.888 --> 15:42.388
UH...WHAT'S EVERYBODY
       LOOKING TO ME FOR?

15:51.564 --> 15:55.166
HELLO.

15:55.168 --> 16:00.437
   I HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR YOU
   THAT MIGHT BENEFIT US ALL.

16:04.275 --> 16:06.276
  I REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION

16:06.278 --> 16:11.280
   THAT DEALS WITH THESE SORT
OF PROBLEMS SWIFTLY, DELICATELY,

16:11.282 --> 16:15.250
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, COVERTLY.

16:15.252 --> 16:17.619
    DOES THAT APPEAL TO YOU?

16:17.621 --> 16:19.988
I CAN HELP YOU
       WITH THOSE HORNS.

16:25.961 --> 16:28.128
THIS IS THE MONSTER
             REALM,

16:28.130 --> 16:32.599
   A DIMENSION TO WHERE I WAS
BANISHED TO MANY MILLENNIA AGO.

16:32.601 --> 16:37.403
     IT IS FROM HERE THAT I
CONTROL ALL OF EARTH'S MONSTERS,

16:37.405 --> 16:39.104
   PREPARING THEM FOR THE DAY

16:39.106 --> 16:41.372
 WHEN WE RETURN TO OUR RIGHTFUL

16:41.374 --> 16:42.573
           DOMINION.

16:42.575 --> 16:45.509
        BUT UNTIL THEN,
    THEY MUST OBEY THE RULE

16:45.511 --> 16:49.045
OF NOT GETTING THEMSELF EXPOSED
         TO THE HUMANS.

16:49.047 --> 16:55.584
   OTHERWISE, THEY WILL HAVE
   TO ANSWER TO ME, THE BOSS.

16:55.586 --> 16:58.653
  YOU KNOW WHY I SUMMONED YOU
             HERE.

16:58.655 --> 17:03.123
BUT, BOSS, IT WASN'T ME.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.290
         IT WASN'T ME.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.525
SAVE YOUR RANCID
            BREATH.

17:06.527 --> 17:09.461
   BY BEING CAUGHT IN PUBLIC,

17:09.463 --> 17:12.396
    YOU BROKE THE FIRST RULE
     OF THE MONSTER REALM,

17:12.398 --> 17:15.967
          AND AS SUCH,
     YOU MUST BE PUNISHED!

17:16.601 --> 17:21.739
I'M MELTING!
            MELTING!

17:21.741 --> 17:25.809
            MELTING!

17:25.810 --> 17:28.478
SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.814
         SHE'S MELTING
    ON MY BEAUTIFUL CARPET.

17:38.321 --> 17:42.456
         MR. HOBNOBLIN,
    YOU DID A FANTASTIC JOB

17:42.458 --> 17:47.293
   SILENCING THOSE REPORTERS
  BEFORE THEY COULD EXPOSE US.

17:50.096 --> 17:53.765
LISTEN, ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED,
      A LITTLE PROMOTION,

17:53.767 --> 17:55.066
       I'D LOVE TO DO IT.

17:55.068 --> 17:56.767
           YES, YES?

17:56.769 --> 17:59.703
  AW. KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS.

18:00.639 --> 18:03.339
     OH! THAT WAS TICKLISH.

18:06.242 --> 18:08.309
SEVEN NEW FOLDERS
     FOR SEVEN NEW MONSTERS

18:08.311 --> 18:10.110
- FOR YOUR APPROVAL.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

18:10.112 --> 18:11.511
 GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD,
             GOOD.

18:11.513 --> 18:12.712
       OH, THIS IS GOOD.

18:12.714 --> 18:15.448
     WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

18:15.450 --> 18:17.650
     THIS -- NO, NOT GOOD.

18:17.652 --> 18:18.651
            THESE --

18:18.653 --> 18:22.221
    THESE ARE ALL DUDS HERE!

18:22.223 --> 18:24.489
       I-I'VE NEVER SEEN
     SO MANY RIDICULOUS --

18:24.491 --> 18:26.491
HOBNOBLIN'S HERE
        TO SEE YOU, SIR.

18:26.493 --> 18:29.527
HOBNOBLIN?!
I'VE ALREADY SEEN THE HOBNOBLIN!

18:29.529 --> 18:34.765
     YOU KNOW, THE HUMAN --

18:34.767 --> 18:37.834
     THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
      THE DELICATE BALANCE

18:37.836 --> 18:41.504
      OF MAINTAINING ORDER
         IN THE WORLD.

18:41.506 --> 18:42.605
       THEY WEAKENED US.

18:42.607 --> 18:44.673
      THEY HUNTED US DOWN.

18:44.675 --> 18:47.609
   OH, I-I DON'T BLAME THEM.

18:47.611 --> 18:49.410
       NO, I-I PITY THEM.

18:49.412 --> 18:53.280
   THEY'RE FEARFUL CREATURES
 WHO NEED SUCCESS TO HELP THEM.

18:53.282 --> 18:56.383
     WE ARE BUT A FRACTION
     OF WHAT WE ONCE WERE.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.319
    HOW ARE WE GOING TO FARE
       IN TODAY'S WORLD?

18:59.321 --> 19:02.422
I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN
     AFRAID OF US ANYMORE.

19:02.424 --> 19:04.757
  IT'S A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS.

19:04.759 --> 19:08.160
 AND THESE SEVEN HERE, I MEAN,

19:08.162 --> 19:11.196
        HOW ARE WE GOING
     TO EVALUATE THEM, HUH?

19:11.198 --> 19:13.798
     I MEAN, WHAT ARE THEY
      GONNA BE AFRAID OF?

19:13.800 --> 19:17.501
  NOBODY'S AFRAID OF ANYTHING
EXCEPT, WELL, LOSING THEIR MONEY

19:17.503 --> 19:19.369
       AND GETTING A ZIT.

19:19.371 --> 19:20.703
I THINK
      I HAVE THE SOLUTION

19:20.705 --> 19:22.371
- FOR WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING.
- YOU DO?

19:22.373 --> 19:24.406

35:11.397 --> 35:17.367
AAH, MY HAND!

35:17.369 --> 35:23.039
         YOU CANNIBAL!

35:23.041 --> 35:25.374
MY CHARACTER?

35:25.376 --> 35:27.509
  MY -- MY -- MY REAL ESTATE?

35:27.511 --> 35:29.077
    MY EXPENSIVE WARDROBE?!

35:29.079 --> 35:32.779
- ALL MY LIFE'S WORK!
UH-OH.

35:41.455 --> 35:47.091
       HAVE YOU NO SENSE
          OF DECORUM?

35:47.093 --> 35:50.661
        WHO DO YOU THINK
  IS GONNA PAY FOR ALL THIS?!

35:50.663 --> 35:52.696
OUR PARENTS.

35:52.698 --> 35:53.830
SELF-ENTITLED,

35:53.832 --> 35:55.531
        LITTLE RODENTS!

35:55.533 --> 36:00.835
 CLEAR UP THIS MESS IMMEDIATELY
    OR YOU'LL GET NO SUPPER!

36:00.837 --> 36:04.138
       I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
      SCOOT, SCOOT, SCOOT!

36:07.475 --> 36:09.209
           FEEL FREE.

36:09.211 --> 36:11.411
AAH!

36:18.285 --> 36:21.219
IT'S SO DUSTY IN HERE.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.288
       IT NEEDS CLEANING.

36:33.330 --> 36:36.298
OH, IT'S GOOD
     TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.800
        LET ME INTRODUCE
        MYSELF PROPERLY.

36:38.802 --> 36:41.235
      MY NAME IS HEINRICH,

36:41.237 --> 36:43.370
       AND I WELCOME YOU
      TO OUR HUMBLE REALM.

36:43.372 --> 36:45.638
   I DO HOPE YOUR EXPERIENCE
 IS GONNA BE PLEASURABLE HERE,

36:45.640 --> 36:49.842
 BUT LET ME WARN YOU THAT THIS
  DIMENSION CAN BE PERTURBING,

36:49.844 --> 36:52.811
          DISTURBING,
   AND ALL MORTALLY WOUNDING,

36:52.813 --> 36:55.880
        SO IT'D BE WISE
 FOR YOU TO WATCH YOUR BACKSIDE

36:55.882 --> 36:58.148
    LEST YOU BE ANNIHILATED.

36:58.150 --> 37:01.251
EX-EXACTLY
      WHAT IS THIS PLACE,

37:01.253 --> 37:04.887
ASIDE FROM BEING REALLY PUNGENT?

37:04.889 --> 37:06.489
UH,

37:06.491 --> 37:07.957
      I REALLY APOLOGIZE.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.893
   ONE OF OUR SWAMP MONSTERS
     IS CUTTING THE CHEESE.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.762
       HE'S GOT SOME KIND
     OF INTESTINAL ISSUES.

37:13.764 --> 37:19.367
BUT IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION,
   THIS IS THE MONSTER REALM.

37:19.369 --> 37:22.236
  IT'S THE CLANDESTINE SECTOR

37:22.238 --> 37:24.871
    THAT WE'VE BEEN BANISHED
        TO BY HUMANITY.

37:24.873 --> 37:26.706
 ONCE, WE WERE A MIGHTY FORCE,

37:26.708 --> 37:30.509
             FEARED
 AND LOATHED IN EQUAL MEASURE,

37:30.511 --> 37:33.778
AND IN ONE BIG DESTRUCTIVE MOVE,
            WE WERE

37:33.780 --> 37:35.946
  WEAKENED BEYOND RECOGNITION.

37:35.948 --> 37:40.016
     OUR LEADER LED US HERE
     TO PRESERVE OUR RACE,

37:40.018 --> 37:43.386
     OUT OF REACH OF THOSE
   WHO WANTED TO DESTROY US,

37:43.388 --> 37:45.588
   AND WE HAVE RETREATED INTO

37:45.590 --> 37:47.823
    THE SHADOWS EVER SINCE.

37:47.825 --> 37:50.826
  I LIKE CROCHET AND CROQUET.

37:50.828 --> 37:52.394
       CALMS THE NERVES.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.995
MORE PRESSINGLY,
            DARLING,

37:53.997 --> 37:57.531
YOU SIMPLY MUST GET ME IN TOUCH
  WITH YOUR INTERIOR DESIGNER.

37:57.533 --> 37:59.933
   THIS PLACE IS TO DIE FOR.

37:59.935 --> 38:01.968
      BLEAK, YET VISCERAL.

38:01.970 --> 38:03.836
    MINIMALIST, YET ORGANIC.

38:03.838 --> 38:05.804
            J'ADORE.

38:05.806 --> 38:09.674
ENOUGH WITH THE
 IRRELEVANT CHATTER, ALL RIGHT?

38:09.676 --> 38:12.276
       WE'VE GOT BUSINESS
    TO ATTEND TO HERE, PAL.

38:12.278 --> 38:13.510
- LET'S GO.
- YES,

38:13.512 --> 38:15.478
OF COURSE, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO.

38:24.951 --> 38:27.285
WHAT?

38:27.287 --> 38:28.319
PAPER CONTRACTS?

38:28.321 --> 38:29.653
     T-THIS IS OLD SCHOOL.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.287
AND THIS IS IN LATIN.

38:31.289 --> 38:32.955
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME
       TO PORE OVER THIS.

38:32.957 --> 38:34.790
 CAN YOU JUST SUM IT UP FOR US?

38:34.792 --> 38:36.925
IT'S A STANDARD
      CONTRACT STIPULATING

38:36.927 --> 38:38.860
  THE TERMS OF OUR ARRANGEMENT
           AS AGREED.

38:38.862 --> 38:41.796
         BY SIGNING IT,
YOU ACQUIESCE TO THE DISPATCHING

38:41.798 --> 38:44.565
       OF YOUR OFFSPRING
  AND THE SUBSEQUENT CAPTURING

38:44.567 --> 38:46.400
      OF SIX SOULS BY OUR

38:46.402 --> 38:49.803
     WELL-TRAINED MONSTERS
  AND OUR PLEDGE TO CARRY OUT

38:49.805 --> 38:55.742
  THE WORK PROFESSIONALLY AND,
  MOST IMPORTANTLY, INVISIBLY.

38:55.744 --> 38:58.077
PERFECT!
    YOU GET RID OF THE KIDS.

38:58.079 --> 39:00.412
      YOU KEEP THE SOULS.
       NOBODY FINDS OUT.

39:00.414 --> 39:02.080
            AWESOME.
           I'M SOLD.

39:02.082 --> 39:03.815
          HERE WE GO.

39:03.817 --> 39:05.850
         THERE'S MINE.

39:05.852 --> 39:07.751
    YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

39:11.689 --> 39:12.689
DARLING,

39:12.691 --> 39:14.657
      THAT COAT IS DIVINE.

39:14.659 --> 39:18.427
   YOU KNOW YOU'D SIMPLY LOOK
 STUNNING AS A HIGH-END SHIRT.

39:18.429 --> 39:19.728
  PAIR IT WITH THE SEASON'S...

39:22.466 --> 39:23.731
            MAGIQUE.

39:28.871 --> 39:30.337
EXCELLENT.

39:30.339 --> 39:33.840
- YOU GO, GIRL.
- AH.

39:35.909 --> 39:42.981
 AND NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
 I INTRODUCE TO YOU...THE BOSS.

39:42.983 --> 39:45.350
EH?

39:45.352 --> 39:50.121
PRESENTING THE BOSS.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.991
     I INTRODUCE YOU TO --

39:54.993 --> 39:57.126
      HA, HA! -- THE BOSS.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.466
              YES!

40:09.838 --> 40:14.674
HOW LOVELY TO SEE
            YOU ALL.

40:14.676 --> 40:19.445
  WELCOME TO MY HUMBLE ABODE.

40:19.447 --> 40:23.782
 ARE YOU THE PARENTS THAT WANT
YOUR YOUNGSTERS DISPATCHED WITH?

40:23.784 --> 40:25.150
YES.

40:25.152 --> 40:26.551
HOW CHARMING.

40:26.553 --> 40:30.855
  STILL, BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

40:35.693 --> 40:37.694
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

40:37.696 --> 40:41.164
  THOUGH IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT

40:41.166 --> 40:43.900
       THAT THE MONSTERS
        DO NOT SUCCEED,

40:43.902 --> 40:49.938
      I -- ME, MR. BOSS --

40:49.940 --> 40:51.973
I WILL STEP IN AND TAKE CARE OF

40:51.975 --> 40:53.908
      MATTERS PERSONALLY.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.676
IF YOU CAN TAKE CARE
       OF THIS YOURSELF,

40:55.678 --> 40:58.178
      WHY NOT STEP IN NOW
     AND SAVE ALL THE FUSS?

40:58.180 --> 41:03.716
THESE SEVEN MONSTERS,
 UH, ARE ACTUALLY ON PROBATION.

41:03.718 --> 41:07.486
     YES. THEY'RE NOT FULLY
          FLEDGED YET.

41:07.488 --> 41:13.924
BUT IF THEY PASS THE TEST, THEY
 WILL BE FULLY-FLEDGED MONSTERS

41:13.926 --> 41:18.928
 WITH ALL ASSOCIATE BENEFITS --
 THAT IS, DENTAL CARE, PENSION,

41:18.930 --> 41:19.962
       PAID MATERNITY --

41:19.964 --> 41:21.663
EVERYBODY WINS, RIGHT?

41:21.665 --> 41:22.797
RIGHT.

41:22.799 --> 41:26.467
   SO, LET US START THE SHOW.

41:27.736 --> 41:30.603
OOF.

41:30.605 --> 41:31.937
      SO NOT SHARE-WORTHY.

41:31.939 --> 41:36.474
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD.

41:36.476 --> 41:38.442
   EVEN BETTER THAN THE ONES
         MY CHEF MAKES.

41:38.444 --> 41:39.943
I'M GONNA BE A CHEF
        WHEN I GROW UP,

41:39.945 --> 41:41.811
       MICHELIN-STARRED.

41:41.813 --> 41:44.647
YOU'LL EAT ALL THE FOOD
  BEFORE IT GETS ON THE PLATE.

41:44.649 --> 41:45.881
EXACTLY. IT'S PERFECT.

41:45.883 --> 41:48.783
     WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?
        A BRAIN SURGEON?

41:50.753 --> 41:52.219
HA, HA.

41:52.221 --> 41:54.955
   I'M GONNA BE A SUPERMODEL,
           OF COURSE.

41:54.957 --> 41:57.557
      SOON, I'LL HAVE WON
 EVERY PAGEANT TITLE THERE IS,

41:57.559 --> 41:59.859
         SO MODELING'S
      THE NATURAL CHOICE.

41:59.861 --> 42:01.827
         DADDY'S GONNA
 GIVE ME THE PERFECT MODEL BODY

42:01.829 --> 42:03.161
     FOR MY 18th BIRTHDAY.

42:03.163 --> 42:05.096
HOWEVER WILL HE
         GIFT-WRAP IT?

42:05.098 --> 42:09.200
HE'S A COSMETIC SURGEON,
   STUPID, THE BEST THERE IS.

42:09.202 --> 42:10.634
     MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE
          HIM A CALL.

42:10.636 --> 42:12.936
WHAT?
    I LOVE THE WAY I LOOK --

42:12.938 --> 42:14.170
         BIG AND ROUND,

42:14.172 --> 42:17.006
    LIKE THE WORLD'S LARGEST
          BUFFET ROLL.

42:17.008 --> 42:18.073
O.M.G.

42:18.075 --> 42:20.108
        #STUFFBOBBYSAYS!

42:20.110 --> 42:21.843
       TOTES ME MATERIAL.

42:21.845 --> 42:23.144
CAN YOU TAG ME IN THAT?

42:23.146 --> 42:24.245
YEAH.
     WHAT'S YOUR USERNAME?

42:24.247 --> 42:26.113
@FATSO115115.

42:26.115 --> 42:29.516
DONE.

42:31.119 --> 42:32.952
          GET A ROOM!

42:34.855 --> 42:37.655
THE GEEKS
        LIKE EACH OTHER.

42:37.657 --> 42:40.524
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
       AWKWARD GOTH GIRL?

42:40.526 --> 42:42.559
   YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL STILL
        SEE YOU, RIGHT?

42:42.561 --> 42:44.794
 JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE US
DOES NOT MEAN YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

42:44.796 --> 42:47.997
UM, SO, CANDY, TELL ME,

42:47.999 --> 42:49.865
WHAT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE THING
  YOUR DAD'S EVER GOTTEN YOU?

42:49.867 --> 42:52.934
HMM, I DON'T KNOW.

42:52.936 --> 42:55.670
       DADDY'S BOUGHT ME
     MANY EXPENSIVE GIFTS.

42:55.672 --> 42:59.707
I GUESS THERE WAS THIS ONE DRESS
 MADE OF LIKE 26,000 DIAMONDS.

42:59.709 --> 43:02.509
   DADDY SAYS IT'S WORTH MORE
   THAN WHAT 10 NORMAL PEOPLE

43:02.511 --> 43:04.544
  MAKE IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

43:04.546 --> 43:06.546
   SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD,
             RIGHT?

43:06.548 --> 43:07.780
RIGHT.

43:07.782 --> 43:10.082
UM, THAT'S NOTHING.

43:10.084 --> 43:12.050
            MY DAD,
   GREG -- I CALL HIM GREG --

43:12.052 --> 43:14.619
 BOUGHT ME THE LARGEST PROPERTY
    IN THE NO-LIFE UNIVERSE.

43:14.621 --> 43:16.020
        THE THING'S GOT
       LIKE 40 BATHROOMS,

43:16.022 --> 43:18.889
AND I THROW THE BIGGEST PARTIES
             THERE.

43:18.891 --> 43:20.090
      PEOPLE COME FROM ALL
         OVER THE MAP.

43:20.092 --> 43:21.724
AH. MUST BE FUN.

43:21.726 --> 43:23.258
WHAT'S THE POINT
   OF OWNING A VIRTUAL HOME?

43:23.260 --> 43:27.929
 THAT'S LITERALLY THE STUPIDEST
     THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

43:27.931 --> 43:30.097
YOU WOULDN'T
      UNDERSTAND, LUDDITE.

43:30.099 --> 43:33.800
HEY,
   I CAN READ...COMIC BOOKS,

43:33.802 --> 43:36.736
  T-SHIRTS WITH WORDS ON THEM.

43:36.738 --> 43:38.704
     UH, I CAN READ, OKAY?!

43:49.047 --> 43:50.847
PASS THE TURKEY!

43:50.849 --> 43:53.216
     RIGHT WHILE IT'S HOT.

43:53.218 --> 43:55.685
THANKS.

43:55.687 --> 43:57.620
OH? UH, FOR WHAT?

43:57.622 --> 44:00.122
SAVING ME FROM CERTAIN
    DEATH BY MORTIFICATION.

44:00.124 --> 44:01.690
WHERE'S THE GRAVY?!

44:01.692 --> 44:03.058
- ANY TIME.
- COME ON, BRING IT OVER.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.794
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
    OVER BOBBY'S FAT MOUTH.

44:05.796 --> 44:07.328
YOU KNOW...

44:14.301 --> 44:17.269
SO THAT'S IT?
     THAT UGLY, LITTLE BUG?

44:17.271 --> 44:18.903
THAT UGLY, LITTLE BUG,

44:18.905 --> 44:22.106
        AS YOU CALL IT,
  IS ACTUALLY A LETHAL WEAPON.

44:22.108 --> 44:23.707
         ONE TINY BITE

44:23.709 --> 44:29.846
    FROM HER AND YOU'RE LEFT
     AN EXCRUCIATING DEATH.

44:29.848 --> 44:33.282
       MELISSA, YOU SEE,
    IS THE LAST OF HER KIND.

44:33.284 --> 44:37.219
       HER ENTIRE SPECIES
WAS WIPED OUT BY AN ASTEROID --

44:37.221 --> 44:42.723
           A DISASTER
  OF UNTHINKABLE PROPORTIONS.

44:42.725 --> 44:46.059
   NOW SHE HAS COME TO EARTH
       TO SPREAD HER SEED

44:46.061 --> 44:47.960
   AND REVIVE HER DYING BREED

44:47.962 --> 44:52.164
BEFORE THEY ARE ALL SNUFFED OUT
            FOREVER.

45:03.309 --> 45:05.209
I DON'T GIVE A TOSS

45:05.211 --> 45:08.011
  ABOUT THIS UGLY BUG'S MATING
      DILEMMAS, ALL RIGHT?

45:08.013 --> 45:10.146
        WE'VE COME HERE
 FOR THE GRISLY BITS, YOU KNOW?

45:10.148 --> 45:11.614
- GO FOR THE GRISLY.
- YEAH.

45:11.616 --> 45:13.916
- WE WANT MORE ACTION.
- YEAH.

45:13.918 --> 45:15.651
MR. KNIGHT,

45:15.653 --> 45:19.154
       IF YOU WILL PLEASE
  EXERCISE A LITTLE PATIENCE,

45:19.156 --> 45:22.056
   I'M JUST GETTING TO THAT.

45:22.058 --> 45:27.160
    FIRST, SHE WILL ENLARGE
    HER RAZOR-SHARP PINCERS,

45:27.162 --> 45:31.697
   AND, THEN, SHE WOULD SINK
     200 NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH

45:31.699 --> 45:34.166
      DEEP INTO YOUR SKIN.

45:34.168 --> 45:36.067
        AND HER EGGS --

45:36.069 --> 45:40.304
      HER EGGS ARE ENCASED
   IN A SORT OF STICKY FLUID.

45:40.306 --> 45:45.242
   SHE WOULD INJECT THAT INTO
YOUR BLOODSTREAM, IN YOUR VEINS.

45:45.244 --> 45:50.213
 THE EGGS CAN GROW AND INCUBATE
           AND GROW,

45:50.215 --> 45:55.217
  AND THEN THEY WOULD EXPLODE
       OUT OF YOUR BODY,

45:55.219 --> 45:58.888
 LEAVING YOU, MR. KNIGHT -- HOW

45:58.890 --> 46:03.825
         SHALL WE SAY?
   -- A LITTLE DISCONCERTED.

46:06.295 --> 46:08.296
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
 THIS ONE KID IN HIGH SCHOOL...

46:08.298 --> 46:11.132

          YOU LIKE IT?

47:18.289 --> 47:20.088

47:20.090 --> 47:22.990
    I MUST GET MOTHER TO BUY
 MORE OF THESE WHEN I GET HOME.

47:22.992 --> 47:26.259

47:29.363 --> 47:35.033
          OH, MY GOD!

47:35.035 --> 47:36.901
            NO, NO!

47:41.239 --> 47:45.842
WELL, THAT DIDN'T
EXACTLY GO TO PLAN, NOW, DID IT?

47:45.844 --> 47:49.478

             PRAWN.

48:11.598 --> 48:13.130
RIGHT, WELL,
      THAT WAS, ALL RIGHT,

48:13.132 --> 48:15.465

I'VE NEVER SEEN
 SO MANY CALORIES IN ONE PLACE

49:03.908 --> 49:05.440
       IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

49:10.345 --> 49:13.580
   HOW CAN YOU PUT THAT JUNK
         IN YOUR BODY?

49:13.582 --> 49:15.615
SAYS THE SILICONE
           PRINCESS.

49:15.617 --> 49:17.984

49:21.055 --> 49:23.522
 SO, WHEN WILL THE MAIN COURSE

49:25.025 --> 49:27.525

51:04.007 --> 51:05.440
   DISRUPTING COMMUNICATION.

51:11.146 --> 51:17.783

51:31.430 --> 51:32.695
LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!

51:35.666 --> 51:38.733
OH, DEAR CANDY, THERE'S
NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF.

51:38.735 --> 51:40.768
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
             BOBBY.

51:40.770 --> 51:44.037
 IF I WERE YOU, I'D FEAR HEART
  DISEASE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES.

51:44.039 --> 51:45.571
NICE ONE!

51:45.573 --> 51:47.339

     TO LIKE YOU, DOLLFACE.

51:47.341 --> 51:49.174

51:49.176 --> 51:50.341
            I MEAN,
WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS, RIGHT?

51:50.343 --> 51:51.775
WE JUST HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

51:51.777 --> 51:53.610
       UH, WITH THE POWER

51:53.612 --> 51:55.612
OKAY, ENOUGH OF THAT
 RIFFRAFF! WE NEED TO SPLIT UP.

         UH, DAVID AND,

51:57.515 --> 52:02.084

OKAY, GREAT.
        TEAM, ON THREE.

52:07.623 --> 52:09.322

             TEAM.

52:10.625 --> 52:12.491
OH, BOY.

52:14.627 --> 52:16.628
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

52:19.365 --> 52:22.834
ROGER BEGAN HIS DAYS
      IN A MYSTERIOUS HALL

52:22.836 --> 52:25.503
 OF AN UNDERGROUND SCIENCE LAB,

52:25.505 --> 52:28.239
WHERE HE WAS BUT A HUMBLE COFFEE

52:28.241 --> 52:30.074
            MACHINE.

52:37.114 --> 52:42.551
         ALL TOO SOON,
  HE FOUND HIMSELF OUTCLASSED,

52:44.620 --> 52:51.358
      A RELIC LEFT TO ROT,
      OBSOLETE, UNWANTED,

52:51.360 --> 52:56.529
           FORGOTTEN,
    UNTIL ONE STORMY NIGHT.

53:42.707 --> 53:49.478
 AND THUS, OUR TERRORIZING TIN
CAN OF PURE ROBOT RAGE WAS BORN.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.612
THAT --

53:50.614 --> 53:52.580
IT'S A PILE OF UGLY SCRAP METAL.

53:52.582 --> 53:55.316
- I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT.
- DON'T WORRY.

53:55.318 --> 53:58.152
     WE'VE GOT PLENTY MORE
          TO SHOW YOU.

53:58.154 --> 53:59.853
HEY, JEEVES!

53:59.855 --> 54:00.920
         JEEVESY, BOY!

54:00.922 --> 54:04.456
         WHERE IS HE?!

54:04.458 --> 54:09.293
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
 HOW ELECTRICITY CAN JUST STOP.

54:09.295 --> 54:12.529
 ISN'T IT, LIKE, ALL AROUND US?

54:12.531 --> 54:14.464
DID YOU EVEN
         GO TO SCHOOL?

54:14.466 --> 54:17.600
    I MEAN, HOW MANY FINGERS
        AM I HOLDING UP?

54:17.602 --> 54:18.867
- WRONG ANSWER.
- OF COURSE.

54:18.869 --> 54:20.335
         BEAUTY SCHOOL.

54:20.337 --> 54:22.203
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

54:22.205 --> 54:25.506
UH, I'VE BEEN
      TO A LOT OF SCHOOLS.

54:31.346 --> 54:32.946
- ODD.
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

54:32.948 --> 54:35.882
WHY DID YOUR PARENTS
    SAY THEY SENT YOU HERE?

54:35.884 --> 54:37.583
CECILIA DIDN'T SAY.

54:37.585 --> 54:41.353
        SHE JUST TOLD ME
   TO GET IN THE CAR OR ELSE.

54:41.355 --> 54:44.756
MY DAD TOLD ME THAT I WAS
COMING HERE TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

54:44.758 --> 54:50.527
 I, UM...DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY.

54:50.529 --> 54:51.961
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

54:58.868 --> 55:00.602
I DON'T KNOW.

55:00.604 --> 55:04.606
   I JUST -- I HAVE A...WEIRD
    FEELING ABOUT ALL THIS.

55:04.608 --> 55:08.643
ME TOO, BUT I HAVE
 BAD FEELINGS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

55:10.712 --> 55:12.512
YEAH.

55:12.514 --> 55:14.447
  UH, I'M PROBABLY JUST BEING
             SILLY.

55:16.950 --> 55:18.917
      I OVERTHINK THINGS.

55:18.919 --> 55:21.953
YEAH, I-I GET THAT.

55:21.955 --> 55:24.422
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
   WE CAN JUST STAY TOGETHER

55:24.424 --> 55:27.825
   AND KEEP OUR EYES PEELED,
   JUST IN CASE YOU'RE RIGHT.

55:27.827 --> 55:29.726
DEAL.

55:36.601 --> 55:38.467
OKAY.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.774

              HUH.

55:58.385 --> 56:01.018
AH! TA-DA!

56:01.020 --> 56:03.053
             WHOA.

56:03.055 --> 56:05.855
   THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE.
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

56:05.857 --> 56:07.122
        I THINK THIS IS
     THE BUTLER'S SURPRISE

56:07.124 --> 56:09.390
 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.

56:09.392 --> 56:11.058
     I WONDER WHAT IT DOES.

56:11.060 --> 56:17.897
  WOW. IT'S SUPER-RETRO, TOO.
              OH!

56:17.899 --> 56:19.732
              AH!

56:22.535 --> 56:25.670
          OH, MY GOSH.
 YOU GUYS, COME CHECK THIS OUT!

56:25.672 --> 56:26.804
          IT MAKES --

56:26.806 --> 56:28.105
 IT MAKES COFFEE, T-THE ROBOT.

56:28.107 --> 56:30.540
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

56:30.542 --> 56:33.809
         IT'S A DRINK.
   THEY SELL THEM IN STORES.

56:33.811 --> 56:35.610
UM, IT'S A LATTE.

56:35.612 --> 56:37.745
    THE ROBOT MAKES LATTES.

56:37.747 --> 56:39.146
DOES IT MAKE CAKES?!

56:39.148 --> 56:41.014
THIS ISN'T JUST
        ANY DRINK, OKAY?

56:41.016 --> 56:42.882
     THIS IS A TRIPLE-CHOC,
     LOW-FAT, CHERRY LATTE

56:42.884 --> 56:47.653
 SERVED BY A FULLY FUNCTIONING
    RETRO-1950s ROBOT, OKAY?

56:47.655 --> 56:50.055
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DRINK
         THAT, ARE YOU?

56:50.057 --> 56:53.024
 I MEAN, BESIDES THE DISGUSTING
          FAT CONTENT,

56:53.026 --> 56:55.760
        THAT THING LOOKS
 LIKE IT'S BEEN HERE FOR YEARS.

56:55.762 --> 56:58.429
  HELLO! IT'S PROBABLY RANCID.

56:58.431 --> 57:00.631
WELL, SMELLS GOOD,
          LOOKS GOOD.

57:00.633 --> 57:02.899
             YOLO.

57:02.901 --> 57:04.834
NICE.

57:09.573 --> 57:10.805
OH, UM, UM,

57:10.807 --> 57:12.540
    UH, DO WE CALL A DOCTOR?
         WHAT DO WE DO?

57:12.542 --> 57:14.775
- UM, I COULD CALL DADDY.
- SHE'S CHOKING.

57:14.777 --> 57:16.009
    SHE NEEDS THE HEIMLICH,
        NOT A FACELIFT.

57:16.011 --> 57:17.910
HEIMLICH!
    HOW DO I -- HOW DO I --

57:17.912 --> 57:19.811
IF SHE CHOKES
TO DEATH, CAN I HAVE THE LATTE?

57:22.081 --> 57:24.681
            O.M.G.!
   YOU GUYS ARE SO GULLIBLE!

57:24.683 --> 57:26.683
             LIKE,
  I WAS TOTALLY TROLLING YOU!

57:26.685 --> 57:27.884
SCARED ME.
         IT WAS FUNNY.

57:27.886 --> 57:29.785
- RIGHT?
- YEAH.

57:29.787 --> 57:31.787
THANKS.
 IT'S, LIKE, SO GOOD, YOU KNOW?

57:31.789 --> 57:33.455
  I MEAN, IT'S GOT THE CHERRY
       AND THE CHOCOLATE.

57:33.457 --> 57:34.656
         IT'S PERFECT.

57:34.658 --> 57:36.557
    I WONDER IF THIS IS MILK
           CHOCOLATE?

57:36.559 --> 57:39.192
 IT'S PROBABLY DARK CHOCOLATE.
 I LIKE MILK CHOCOLATE BETTER,

57:39.194 --> 57:40.193
             BUT...

57:40.195 --> 57:43.062
             WHAT?

57:43.064 --> 57:44.897
DESTROY ALL HIPSTERS!

57:44.899 --> 57:46.832
WHOA.

57:46.834 --> 57:49.067
           HOW COOL!

57:49.069 --> 57:51.536
HIPSTERS MUST DIE!

57:55.707 --> 58:00.810
WHERE DID SHE GO?!

58:00.812 --> 58:02.611
       WHERE'S THE LATTE?

58:02.613 --> 58:05.647
THAT WILL TEACH YOU
 FOR ABANDONING OLD TECHNOLOGY.

58:11.754 --> 58:13.787
NOW, THAT --

58:13.789 --> 58:17.457
THAT WAS MORE LIKE IT, MR. BOSS!

58:17.459 --> 58:19.592
CHILDREN, PREPARE TO DIE!

58:19.594 --> 58:20.893
YOU
     OVERGROWN COFFEE POT!

58:20.895 --> 58:25.497
     THAT ACTUALLY WORKED?

58:27.766 --> 58:29.166
        THAT WORKS, TOO.

58:29.168 --> 58:31.768
     ALL RIGHT, GOTH GIRL,
    BARBIE DOLL, BLUE SHIRT,

58:31.770 --> 58:35.804
          THE FAT ONE,
LET'S SCRAP THIS HUNK OF METAL.

58:38.073 --> 58:39.673
              DIE!

58:39.675 --> 58:43.710
     I WILL EAT YOU APART!

58:43.712 --> 58:46.713
ALAS, POOR ROGER.

58:46.715 --> 58:49.849
          MAY HE SERVE
     CELESTIAL CAPPUCCINOS

58:49.851 --> 58:52.751
  IN VENDING-MACHINE VALHALLA.

58:52.753 --> 58:55.120
SCRAPPUCCINO,
           YOU MEAN.

58:55.122 --> 58:56.855
NO.

58:56.857 --> 59:01.593
     ACTUALLY, NO, I DON'T.
              HMM.

59:01.595 --> 59:03.962
BEATING ROBOTS
     SURE MAKES ME HUNGRY.

59:08.534 --> 59:09.800
OH, THANK GOD
          YOU'RE HERE.

59:09.802 --> 59:11.601
     UM, SOMETHING TERRIBLE
         HAS HAPPENED.

59:11.603 --> 59:14.036
      UH, WE NEED TO ALERT
  THE AUTHORITIES OR SOMEONE.

59:14.038 --> 59:15.937
OH!

59:18.140 --> 59:21.041
WE'RE GONNA NEED A MOP UP HERE.

59:26.146 --> 59:29.548
SIR,
     ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

59:40.592 --> 59:43.627
JUST A MO...

59:49.699 --> 59:54.869
- NOT ANOTHER BACKSTORY!
- NO.

59:54.871 --> 59:57.271
  THIS TIME, IT'S A BAT-STORY.

59:59.675 --> 01:00:01.207
YOU SEE,

01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:05.778
   OUR BUTLER WAS STRUCK DOWN
   WITH A TERRIBLE DISEASE --

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.647
   A REAL CURSE CALLED O.C.D.

01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:10.815
O.C.D.?

01:00:10.817 --> 01:00:12.616
        O.C.D. -- THAT'S
       WHAT SETS HIM OFF?

01:00:12.618 --> 01:00:14.584
HE WAS SADDENED.
         HE WAS RUINED.

01:00:14.586 --> 01:00:18.888
          SO HE TURNED
TO EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACEUTICALS.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.258
    THAT SET HIM ON THE ROAD
    TO RUIN, AND OF COURSE,

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:28.730
   HE WAS HELPED ON THAT ROAD
    BY A CERTAIN DR. GUANO.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:33.101
    DR. GUANO HAD DEVELOPED
AN ANTI-COMPULSIVE DRUG DERIVED

01:00:33.103 --> 01:00:38.272
 FROM THE PROTEINS PRODUCED BY
THE AMAZONIAN SACKED-WINGED BAT.

01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:44.577
        SUFFICE TO SAY,
     IT DIDN'T GO TO PLAN,

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:46.211
       AND NOW HIS O.C.D.

01:00:46.213 --> 01:00:51.882
     MANIFESTS ITSELF IN AN
ALTOGETHER MORE BESTIAL MANNER.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:04.659
DO YOU EXPECT
          US TO CARE?

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.260
  YEAH, YOU EXPECT US TO CARE
         ABOUT YOUR --

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:09.196
 YOUR DUMB BUTLER'S SOB STORY?

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.931
    'CAUSE YOU'RE OFF, PAL.

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:12.165
             YEAH.

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:13.866
        YOU'RE WAY OFF.

01:01:13.868 --> 01:01:17.035
ONE MUSTN'T
  BECOME SOFT TO THE TRIFLING,

01:01:17.037 --> 01:01:19.837
LITTLE EMOTIONS OF ONE'S STAFF.

01:01:19.839 --> 01:01:22.039
OH, WELL, THANK YOU
    FOR THAT GEM OF INSIGHT,

01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:24.174
        MS. GINGERFIELD.

01:01:24.176 --> 01:01:27.177
   ADVICE TO LIVE BY -- NOT!

01:01:30.782 --> 01:01:33.616
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
     ABOUT MAKING A MESS?!

01:01:48.964 --> 01:01:50.931
COME ON, COME ON!

01:01:50.933 --> 01:01:53.199
IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE,
          LEAVE TRAPS!

01:01:53.201 --> 01:01:57.903
      WE DON'T HAVE TIME!

01:01:57.905 --> 01:01:59.404
              MAN!

01:02:02.741 --> 01:02:05.642
WHAT IN THE NAME
 OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND TASTY!

01:02:14.351 --> 01:02:15.818
BONJOUR,

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:21.356
        ME SOUP DU JOUR!

01:02:21.358 --> 01:02:24.759
NEXT UP,
   WE HAVE MONSIEUR BABETTE,

01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:26.227
      WHO, AS YOU CAN SEE,

01:02:26.229 --> 01:02:29.363
  IS A CRYPTID OF THE BIGFOOT
    VARIETY, OTHERWISE KNOWN

01:02:29.365 --> 01:02:30.897
           AS A YETI.

01:02:30.899 --> 01:02:32.298
IF HE BITES IT,

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.401
         I CALL SHOTGUN
     ON THAT LUSCIOUS PELT.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.836
WELL,
    HE HAD A FAMILY ONCE --

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:43.841
        A WIFE, A MATE,
     A PLACE TO CALL HOME.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:48.078
         UNTIL ONE DAY,
BABETTE DISCOVERED THE SUBSTANCE

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.748
  THAT WAS TO ALTER THE COURSE
      OF HIS LIFE FOREVER.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.449
HMM.

01:02:59.722 --> 01:03:01.255
CANDY!

01:03:10.331 --> 01:03:13.866
       HIS LOVE FOR CANDY
GREW INTO A CRIPPLING ADDICTION,

01:03:13.868 --> 01:03:17.302
 SO PROFOUND THAT HE WAS DRIVEN
   TO BREAK THE BIGFOOT CODE

01:03:17.304 --> 01:03:20.872
        AND FIND WORK TO
       SUPPORT HIS HABIT!

01:03:27.245 --> 01:03:31.181
    HE BECAME A LUMBERJACK,
   AND AT FIRST, HE WAS OKAY.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:32.182
      HE SLEPT ALL NIGHT.

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:34.184
       HE WORKED ALL DAY.

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:37.820
   BUT WHEN HE RETURNED HOME
         TO HIS WIFE...

01:03:48.864 --> 01:03:51.232
      SHUNNED BY HIS RACE,

01:03:51.234 --> 01:03:56.369
        MONSIEUR BABETTE
 LEFT HIS NATIVE FRENCH CANADIA

01:03:56.371 --> 01:04:00.840
     TO COME HERE TO START
   A NEW LIFE, A NEW FAMILY.

01:04:00.842 --> 01:04:01.974
ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW,
            WE KNOW.

01:04:01.976 --> 01:04:03.942
       ANOTHER SOB STORY.
            I MEAN,

01:04:03.944 --> 01:04:06.311
   PARDON MY LACK OF SYMPATHY
  FOR A DOWNTRODDEN HAIR BALL,

01:04:06.313 --> 01:04:08.379
     BUT COULD WE JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE, I MEAN LITERALLY.

01:04:08.381 --> 01:04:10.848
SORRY IF WE HELD
            YOU UP.

01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.316
 HAVE YOU GOT SOMEWHERE TO GO?

01:04:15.888 --> 01:04:17.420
THIS GUY'S KILLING ME.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.122
IT'S BIGFOOT!

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.458
OH, NO,
            MON AMI.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.427
      I HAVE SIZE 9 ONLY.

01:04:40.038 --> 01:04:44.074
COME ON!
            COME ON!

01:04:57.554 --> 01:05:00.422
COME OUT,
        LITTLE CHILDREN.

01:05:00.424 --> 01:05:03.558
   I HAVE CROISSANTS, CREPES,
           AND CANDY.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.026
- WHAT KIND?!
- SHUT UP!

01:05:05.028 --> 01:05:07.428
    GO AWAY, YOU BIG FREAK!

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.096
  YOU'VE GOT A BIG, SCARY AX!

01:05:09.098 --> 01:05:11.031
BUT OF COURSE
             I DO!

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:13.666
      OUR FOOD IS STRONG,
        LIKE OUR HEARTS!

01:05:13.668 --> 01:05:16.235
  THAT'S WHY WE MUST USE AXES
           TO CUT IT!

01:05:16.237 --> 01:05:18.103
          AH, THE AX!

01:05:18.105 --> 01:05:21.306
        IT IS THE PROUD
  LUMBERJACK'S KNIFE AND FORK!

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:26.110
NOW COME OUT SO WE CAN ALL SHARE
      THOSE TASTY TREATS!

01:05:26.112 --> 01:05:27.277
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US?

01:05:27.279 --> 01:05:28.611
I WANT TO TALK.

01:05:28.613 --> 01:05:30.379
I THOUGHT
     YOU WANTED TO FEED US!

01:05:30.381 --> 01:05:33.248
OUI,
   MONSIEUR, WE EAT, WE TALK.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.617
- OH, IT'S VERY FRENCH-CANADIAN.
NUH-UH!

01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:37.185
 I'VE SEEN ENOUGH CREEPY STUFF

01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:39.086
            TO KNOW
  WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE!

01:05:39.088 --> 01:05:42.122
        I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
     I'M CALLING MY FATHER!

01:05:42.124 --> 01:05:44.424
ALL RIGHT,
     YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE

01:05:44.426 --> 01:05:48.294
     BUT TO KEEP KNOCKING!

01:05:48.296 --> 01:05:49.695
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
          USE HIS AX?

01:05:49.697 --> 01:05:51.697
       HEY, YOU'RE A BIG,
        DUMB MONKEY MAN!

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:54.032
D-DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:57.235
    SHH! DON'T PROVOKE HIM.

01:05:57.237 --> 01:05:59.570
HUH?
          WHAT'S THIS?

01:05:59.572 --> 01:06:01.405
              HUH?

01:06:01.407 --> 01:06:04.274
              OOH!

01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:21.389
THIS IS,
     LIKE, TOTALLY FREAKY.

01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:24.158
MAYBE WE'RE ALL DREAMING.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.359
- OW!
- NO.

01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:27.227
MAYBE THIS HOUSE
          IS HAUNTED.

01:06:27.229 --> 01:06:29.629
MAYBE WE ARE ENCROACHING
   ON THESE THINGS' TERRITORY

01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:33.332
- SOMEHOW.
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

01:06:33.334 --> 01:06:35.434
    OUR PARENTS SENT US HERE
       TO GET RID OF US.

01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:37.002
IS SHE STILL ALIVE?!

01:06:37.004 --> 01:06:38.136
YEAH.

01:06:38.138 --> 01:06:40.338
 THAT WAS THE -- THE PHONE ONE.

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.474
GIANT ROBOT MONSTER EVAPORATED.

01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:46.710
BUT WHY?
 WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE IT?

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.244
     THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT.

01:06:48.246 --> 01:06:50.713
OH, YES, THEY WOULD.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:53.348
IT'S THE CAT.
          IT CAN TALK!

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:56.517
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR
 LITTLE GROUP-THERAPY SESSION,

01:06:56.519 --> 01:06:59.653
BUT I HAVE SOME TROUBLING NEWS.

01:06:59.655 --> 01:07:03.056
OH, MY CAT!

01:07:03.058 --> 01:07:05.658
YES, MOLLY, I CAN TALK.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.993
 AND IT PAINS ME TO BE THE ONE
      TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

01:07:07.995 --> 01:07:11.096
        BUT YOU'RE RIGHT
    ABOUT YOUR PARENTS, TOO.

01:07:11.098 --> 01:07:13.164
   THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:15.766
       YOU WERE SENT HERE
       TO BE DISPOSED OF!

01:07:15.768 --> 01:07:17.334
NO, I DON'T --
      I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

01:07:17.336 --> 01:07:18.368
    WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.336
NO, MY -- MY DAD IS A GOOD MAN.

01:07:20.338 --> 01:07:21.470
     MY DAD IS A GREAT MAN.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:28.609
   YOUR DAD IS A CRIME LORD,
      AND HE'S SICK OF YOU

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:32.245
    AND YOUR SQUEAKY-CLEAN,
     GOODY-TWO-SHOES WAYS.

01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:36.716
    YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT
        TO HIS BAD NAME.

01:07:36.718 --> 01:07:38.584
WELL,
      I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:41.186
        DADDY LOVES ME.
  HE SAYS I'M HIS FINEST WORK.

01:07:41.188 --> 01:07:45.657
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
 HOW MANY JUDGES DADDY DEAREST

01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:50.395
        HAS HAD TO BRIBE
      JUST TO SHUT YOU UP?

01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:55.133
   OH, SURE, MAYBE HE'S PROUD
   OF HIS LITTLE BARBIE DOLL,

01:07:55.135 --> 01:07:58.302
        BUT HE'S PROUDER
      OF HIS BANK BALANCE.

01:08:06.043 --> 01:08:08.443
      OH, THE TRUTH HURTS!

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:11.612
     OH, IT HURTS SO MUCH!

01:08:11.614 --> 01:08:13.347
 SAME GOES FOR THE REST OF YOU.

01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:16.283
   A BUNCH OF SPOILED BRATS.

01:08:16.285 --> 01:08:18.551
       THEY LOOK AT YOU,
  AND ALL THEY SEE IS A DRAIN

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.352
      ON THEIR FINANCES --

01:08:20.354 --> 01:08:22.487
          DEAD WEIGHT.

01:08:22.488 --> 01:08:26.057
SO WHAT, I GUESS YOU'RE
 JUST HERE TO TORMENT US, THEN?

01:08:26.059 --> 01:08:27.224
- IS THAT IT?
- OH,

01:08:27.225 --> 01:08:30.627
  IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:38.067
  NOW, WHICH PRECOCIOUS LITTLE
  PEST WILL I KILL FIRST, HMM?

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:41.703
     DECISIONS, DECISIONS.

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:47.774
OUR FIFTH ANTAGONIST
 IS A PRODUCT OF A LOVE AFFAIR

01:08:47.777 --> 01:08:53.345
 BETWEEN A RARE JAPANESE DEMON
        CAT AND A COMMON

01:08:53.348 --> 01:08:56.649
        AMERICAN TOMCAT.

01:08:56.651 --> 01:09:00.452
   DURING ONE OF HIS NIGHTLY
      STROLLS, THIS TOMCAT

01:09:00.453 --> 01:09:04.656
  CAME ACROSS A DEMONIC BEAUTY
      VISITING FROM JAPAN.

01:09:09.461 --> 01:09:11.828
  IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:13.764
THEIR UNION BEHIND THE DUMPSTER

01:09:13.765 --> 01:09:18.667
         BROUGHT FORTH
      DAISY THE DEMON CAT.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:24.106
   I THINK YOU CAN ALL AGREE
  THE RESULT IS VERY SPECIAL.

01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:57.202
BONSOIR,

01:09:57.204 --> 01:09:59.370
            KITTEN!

01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:00.738
HI, BABETTE.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.506
      NICE JOB BACK THERE.

01:10:02.508 --> 01:10:04.174
MERCI!

01:10:04.176 --> 01:10:07.544
   PERHAPS YOU CAN REWARD ME
          WITH A KISS.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.745
OW.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:10.846
EW.

01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:12.814
   IN YOUR DREAMS, SASQUATCH.

01:10:12.816 --> 01:10:16.584
YOU KNOW,
 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CAT LOVER.

01:10:21.456 --> 01:10:23.622
ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN.

01:10:23.624 --> 01:10:29.727
     NO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
    I HAVE GOT A JOB TO DO.

01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:32.763
STUPID,
       BUMBLING BIGFOOT.

01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.748
OH!
         I AM STARVING!

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.616
BOBBY!

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.555
Okay, so, where did we
 land on the whole chip thing?

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:13.432
FILTHY, HAIRY, NASTY,
        MESSY MONSTERS.

01:11:13.434 --> 01:11:15.901
     THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.
             HMPF!

01:11:33.352 --> 01:11:35.453
Okay.

01:11:35.455 --> 01:11:38.355
       Come on, come on.

01:11:50.267 --> 01:11:51.934
WHAT NOW?

01:12:03.279 --> 01:12:05.313
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

01:12:05.315 --> 01:12:09.550
 SHE WAS ONCE A POPULAR LOUNGE
SINGER AND QUITE A LOOKER, TOO.

01:12:11.886 --> 01:12:14.621
   BUT REBECCA WASN'T HAPPY.

01:12:14.623 --> 01:12:16.656
HER REPERTOIRE HAD BECOME STALE,

01:12:16.658 --> 01:12:19.558
       AND THE JAZZ CROWD
        WAS UNFORGIVING.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.928
    SHE NEEDED NEW MATERIAL!

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:28.399
   AND SHE FOUND IT IN A MOST
       UNFORTUNATE PLACE.

01:12:28.401 --> 01:12:32.403
  HER PERFORMANCE OF THIS NEW
 MATERIAL WENT DOWN A STORM --

01:12:32.405 --> 01:12:33.871
        UNTIL, THAT IS,

01:12:33.873 --> 01:12:36.907
   A SLIMY MASS OF TENTACLES
        ERUPTED FROM HER

01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:38.308
        BEAUTIFUL FACE.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.882
         THE UNPLEASANT
      AND PERMANENT RESULT

01:12:46.884 --> 01:12:52.486
   OF AN ANCIENT INCANTATION
   SHE UNWITTINGLY PERFORMED.

01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:55.055
NIGHTMARE, DARLING,
           NIGHTMARE.

01:12:55.057 --> 01:12:58.058
EVEN <i> I</i> COULDN'T FIX
         THAT HOT MESS.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.860
YOU'RE SO SUPERFICIAL.

01:13:00.862 --> 01:13:03.629
          DO YOU THINK
     A FACE IS EVERYTHING?

01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:06.832
    HEY, I'D TAKE THAT BODY
        OVER THAT TRAIL

01:13:06.834 --> 01:13:10.068
   OF DEAD SKUNKS YOU'VE BEEN
     FLOPPING WITH ANY DAY.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:12.670
YES, CHARMING.

01:13:12.672 --> 01:13:15.472
LOOK INTO MY EYES

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:20.043
    AND STARE INTO THE WELL
      OF INFINITE MADNESS.

01:13:20.045 --> 01:13:27.417
   THEN YOU SHALL BE READY TO
 DESCEND INTO ETERNAL DARKNESS!

01:13:40.796 --> 01:13:43.396
              OHH!

01:14:11.623 --> 01:14:13.357
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?!

01:14:13.359 --> 01:14:14.858
- LET'S GO!
- WELL, NOT THROUGH HERE.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.693
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:14:16.695 --> 01:14:21.097
I'VE SEEN...HORRIBLE
            THINGS.

01:14:21.099 --> 01:14:22.598
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.433
WHAT ABOUT CANDY?

01:14:24.435 --> 01:14:25.500
YES, I'VE GOT SOME!

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:26.734
THE GIRL!

01:14:26.736 --> 01:14:28.836
- OH.
- BARBIE DOLL?

01:14:28.838 --> 01:14:31.405
- COME ON!
- BARBIE DOLL!

01:14:31.407 --> 01:14:36.075
THIS IS GORGEOUS.

01:14:36.077 --> 01:14:37.676
     WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

01:14:37.678 --> 01:14:39.711
GIVE ME

01:14:39.713 --> 01:14:43.381
OH, YOU WANT THIS?

01:14:43.383 --> 01:14:46.050
  AN UGLY HAG LIKE YOU DOESN'T
DESERVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PIECE.

01:14:46.052 --> 01:14:47.084
- GIVE IT TO ME!
- IT

01:14:47.086 --> 01:14:48.051
   BELONGS ON MY PRETTY NECK.

01:14:48.053 --> 01:14:49.952
GIVE IT TO ME!

01:14:49.954 --> 01:14:52.654
WITH THIS LITTLE BEAUTY,
  I'LL WIN EVERY PAGEANT FAIR

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:54.956
          AND SQUARE.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:55.923
              NO!

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:57.791
              NO!

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.231
C-CANDY!
- NO!

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:07.534
- GET AWAY FROM TENTACLES!
- NO!

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:11.070
DO NOT FIGHT THE ONE
      WITH THE TENTACLES!

01:15:11.072 --> 01:15:12.738
CANDY, COME ON!

01:15:41.696 --> 01:15:43.930
HEY!
            OH, AAH!

01:15:43.932 --> 01:15:49.001
         HEY, HEY, OH!

01:15:55.941 --> 01:15:58.108
OH, POOR CANDY.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:59.175
I KNOW.

01:16:05.815 --> 01:16:07.081
MMM!

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:10.684
  FOIE GRAS TASTES LIKE CANDY.

01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:20.026
CONGRATULATIONS!

01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:23.095
I-I MUST SAY,
  I FEEL LIKE A HUGE WEIGHT'S

01:16:23.097 --> 01:16:24.329
          BEEN LIFTED
       OFF OF MY CHEST --

01:16:24.331 --> 01:16:28.700
      KIND OF LIPOSUCTION
         FOR THE SOUL!

01:16:28.702 --> 01:16:30.001
- INDEED.
- YOU'RE SO BAD!

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:32.236
WOULD YOU SAY
        THAT SQUID WITCH

01:16:32.238 --> 01:16:37.941
        AND HAIRY SCARY
 HAVE PASSED THE TEST, MASTER?

01:16:37.943 --> 01:16:41.311
      OR PERHAPS NOT YETI?

01:16:41.313 --> 01:16:44.681
NOT YETI.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:45.982
HEY, THE DOOR.

01:16:45.984 --> 01:16:48.284
             QUIET.

01:16:49.753 --> 01:16:52.955
UP HERE.

01:16:55.926 --> 01:16:56.858
OH, LOOK OUT!

01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:10.902
HEY, FUR BALL,
       LET'S TAKE A BATH.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.145
I HATE CATS.

01:17:23.147 --> 01:17:25.113
            COME ON.

01:17:48.002 --> 01:17:52.972
MR. BEET
WAS ONCE AN ACCLAIMED SCIENTIST.

01:17:52.974 --> 01:17:56.408
       HIS GREAT AMBITION
  WAS TO GENETICALLY ENGINEER

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:59.978
        A UNIQUE STRAIN
    OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.982
WHICH WOULD BE MORE APPEALING TO
           CHILDREN.

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:07.652
  WHEN HIS INITIAL EXPERIMENTS
     PROVED DISAPPOINTING,

01:18:07.654 --> 01:18:14.124
          HE RESORTED
   TO MORE EXTREME MEASURES.

01:18:14.126 --> 01:18:16.893
   HE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HE
    COULD TRANSPLANT A COPY

01:18:16.895 --> 01:18:19.862
        OF HIS OWN FACE
      ONTO A VEGETABLE --

01:18:19.864 --> 01:18:22.397
     IN THIS CASE, A BEET!

01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:24.699
        -- AND THAT THIS
     PROCESS WOULD PROVIDE

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:27.935
  A MORE SATISFACTORY OUTCOME.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:30.804
        HE COULDN'T HAVE
        BEEN MORE WRONG.

01:18:40.347 --> 01:18:45.383
BEET!

01:18:45.385 --> 01:18:49.120
          DO YOU KNOW
   WHY THEY CALL ME MR. BEET?

01:18:49.122 --> 01:18:51.422
BECAUSE YOU'RE A BEET?

01:18:54.827 --> 01:18:56.259
              NO.

01:19:00.864 --> 01:19:04.099
 BECAUSE I LIKE TO "BEAT" KIDS.

01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:06.934
ME TOO -- ME TOO.

01:19:09.037 --> 01:19:10.437
WE SHOULD BE FRIENDS, YOU AND I.

01:19:10.439 --> 01:19:12.305
      NO FIGHTING, RIGHT?

01:19:12.307 --> 01:19:16.442
     POUND IT OUT, BREWSKI,
    RIGHT ON THE OLD KNUCKS.

01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:24.182
            OH, MAN!

01:19:24.184 --> 01:19:25.716
            OH, OH!

01:19:25.718 --> 01:19:29.052
        REALLY? A BEET?

01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:30.720
           COME ON --

01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:32.421
          HERE WE GO.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.860
YOU MESSY PUP!

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:44.464
      I'LL TEACH YOU, YOU
 FLAKE-CRUNCHING CRUMB BADGER!

01:19:48.935 --> 01:19:52.304
TICKY-TICKY-TICKY-TICKY! SUFFER!

01:19:53.239 --> 01:19:59.877
AREN'T BEETS
 SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOU?!

01:20:07.818 --> 01:20:10.019
       I BET THAT BURNED!

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:13.321
            OH, OH!

01:20:16.024 --> 01:20:18.892
              AAH!

01:20:19.927 --> 01:20:21.060
            ENOUGH.

01:20:21.062 --> 01:20:22.828
        PLEASE, PLEASE.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:24.529
        ALL I WANTED WAS
    FOR YOU TO BE MY FRIEND!

01:20:24.531 --> 01:20:27.965
   WHOO! RIGHT IN THE SEEDS!

01:20:31.537 --> 01:20:33.503
NOTHING?

01:20:33.505 --> 01:20:35.071
- NOTHING.
- AW, COME ON.

01:20:45.813 --> 01:20:47.246
JUST ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

01:20:55.522 --> 01:20:58.956
  YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE, MAN?

01:20:58.958 --> 01:21:03.827
 YOU'RE JUST A BIG, FAT BULLY!

01:21:03.829 --> 01:21:08.130
OH, POOR BABY.

01:21:08.132 --> 01:21:09.297
           COME HERE.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:12.933
   LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED A HUG.

01:21:12.935 --> 01:21:19.038
YOU KNOW,
  WE'RE ALIKE IN SO MANY WAYS.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.440
       WE BOTH HAVE HARD,
        GROSS EXTERIORS,

01:21:21.442 --> 01:21:24.309
          BUT INSIDE,
    WE HAVE HEARTS OF GOLD.

01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:26.344
  I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN KISSED.

01:21:26.346 --> 01:21:28.379
  I WASN'T POPULAR IN SCHOOL.

01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:33.817
              NO!

01:21:33.819 --> 01:21:36.452
GET BACK.
     I'LL SHOW YOU A MESS.

01:21:36.454 --> 01:21:40.589
NOW, CHILDREN, BOBBY
    AND I WERE JUST PLAYING.

01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:44.859
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BOBBY?
- NO.

01:21:55.136 --> 01:21:59.538
- HAI, HAI, HAI!
- HERE.

01:22:05.545 --> 01:22:06.477
COME ON!

01:22:06.479 --> 01:22:09.245
         LET'S GET HIM.

01:22:12.182 --> 01:22:14.049
       WHERE'S HE GOING?

01:22:23.223 --> 01:22:26.491
NOT COOL!

01:22:26.493 --> 01:22:30.294
             MAMA!

01:22:37.368 --> 01:22:40.001
     I JUST PUT ANOTHER MAN
          ON THE MOON.

01:22:42.538 --> 01:22:44.871
COME ON.

01:22:55.415 --> 01:22:57.149
WHAT NOW?

01:22:57.151 --> 01:22:59.284
UH, WE NEED TO FIND
     SOMETHING WE CAN USE.

01:22:59.286 --> 01:23:01.152
GOOD IDEA.

01:23:12.096 --> 01:23:16.965
  THE BATLER WON'T BE PLEASED,
         MAKING A MESS.

01:23:27.942 --> 01:23:29.609
YOU THINKING
       WHAT I'M THINKING?

01:23:29.611 --> 01:23:31.510
I THINK SO.

01:23:49.461 --> 01:23:51.562
BONE-CRUNCHING CRISPS?

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.048
      OOH! MONSTER BITES!

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.017
OH LA LA!

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:52.552
         MONSTER BITES!

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:56.788
HUH?

01:24:57.589 --> 01:24:59.790
GET AWAY FROM MY MONSTER
             BITES!

01:25:07.164 --> 01:25:08.264
NO,
          NO, NO, NO.

01:25:08.266 --> 01:25:09.298
UH-OH.

01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:24.310
TRICK OR TREAT!

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:39.322
CHOKE ON THEM!
         CHOKE ON THEM!

01:25:39.324 --> 01:25:42.892
         CHOKE ON THEM!
         CHOKE ON THEM!

01:25:46.529 --> 01:25:49.430
WELL...

01:25:49.432 --> 01:25:51.165
        THAT'S A RELIEF!

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:56.169
           OH, WHOO!

01:25:56.171 --> 01:25:58.905
YEAH!
     BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT!

01:25:58.907 --> 01:26:00.573
        OUR NEW RECRUITS
       ARE REALLY COMING

01:26:00.575 --> 01:26:02.408
  INTO THEIR OWN, AREN'T THEY?

01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:03.876
A REALLY PROMISING
         BUNCH, MASTER.

01:26:03.878 --> 01:26:05.577
   IN FACT, YOU COULD SAY --

01:26:05.579 --> 01:26:07.445
I'D RATHER YOU
 DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, HEINRICH.

01:26:07.447 --> 01:26:09.513
UH...

01:26:09.515 --> 01:26:13.517
ARE WE READY FOR THE FINAL ACT?

01:26:13.519 --> 01:26:15.552
HEY, BRING IT OUT!

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:19.655
YES.

01:26:19.657 --> 01:26:24.225
         TIME TO FINISH
 THOSE INSUFFERABLE LOVE BIRDS.

01:26:28.464 --> 01:26:29.629
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:26:31.165 --> 01:26:32.330
WE'RE TRAPPED.

01:26:32.332 --> 01:26:33.631
WELL, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

01:26:33.633 --> 01:26:35.332
WELL,
     IT SEEMS LIKE A SPELL,

01:26:35.334 --> 01:26:37.667
WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT FISH FACE
     IS PROBABLY BEHIND IT,

01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:39.235
  SO WE SHOULD TAKE HER DOWN.

01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:40.336
YEAH, TAKE HER DOWN.
             GOOD.

01:26:40.338 --> 01:26:41.403
         I-I LIKE THAT.

01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:42.604
            BUT HOW?

01:26:42.606 --> 01:26:43.938
I'LL HAVE
      TO REFLECT ON THAT.

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:45.906
REFLECT...

01:26:45.908 --> 01:26:48.275
       REFLECT, REFLECT!
      OH, YOU'RE A GENIUS!

01:26:48.277 --> 01:26:49.643
- I AM?
- YES!

01:26:49.645 --> 01:26:51.444
       ALL WE HAVE TO DO
  IS GET HER REALLY MAD AT US

01:26:51.446 --> 01:26:52.778
  SO SHE TRIES TO CAST A SPELL
         ON ONE OF US,

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:54.412
     LIKE SHE DID TO CANDY,
         BUT WE'LL USE

01:26:54.414 --> 01:26:56.280
 A MIRROR TO REFLECT THE SPELL
          BACK AT HER.

01:26:56.282 --> 01:26:57.381
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:26:57.383 --> 01:26:58.615
THIS IS GREAT.

01:26:58.617 --> 01:27:00.383
I <i> AM</i> A GENIUS.

01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:12.927
HEY, OCTOPUS HEAD.

01:27:12.929 --> 01:27:15.529
  HOW'D YOU GET SO TENTACLE-Y,
              HUH?

01:27:28.308 --> 01:27:31.276
HEY, SEND ONE MY WAY
         INSTEAD, HUH?

01:27:38.783 --> 01:27:40.517
MOLLY?

01:27:40.519 --> 01:27:42.552
     MOLLY, PLEASE BE OKAY.

01:27:42.554 --> 01:27:43.819
             MOLLY?

01:27:43.821 --> 01:27:45.220
HMM?

01:27:45.222 --> 01:27:49.390
ALL RIGHT, MOLLY.
        MOLLY, HEY, HEY.

01:27:49.392 --> 01:27:53.560
           COME HERE.
            MOLLY...

01:27:53.562 --> 01:27:56.863
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM.

01:27:56.865 --> 01:28:00.733
YEAH, YEAH.

01:28:00.735 --> 01:28:02.601
    YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.570
      OKAY, WE GOT TO GO.

01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:27.554
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
         WAIT! GET IN!

01:28:27.556 --> 01:28:30.890
- GOOD?
- YEAH.

01:28:30.892 --> 01:28:34.760
COME ON, YOU GUYS!
     THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:40.731
NO!

01:28:43.835 --> 01:28:45.836
AND TELL YOUR PARENTS

01:28:45.838 --> 01:28:49.472
          THEY'RE NOT
  GETTING THEIR DEPOSIT BACK!

01:29:16.399 --> 01:29:21.302
NICE CAR.

01:29:21.304 --> 01:29:25.673
ALLER, ALLER!

01:29:33.948 --> 01:29:36.883
- THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US!
- HUH?

01:29:39.386 --> 01:29:41.086
HEY, CHILDREN,

01:29:41.088 --> 01:29:44.722
             GUESS
WHAT WE'RE HAVING FOR BREAKFAST!

01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:46.356
              YOU!

01:29:47.892 --> 01:29:50.492
NOT IF I HAVE ANYTHING
   TO SAY ABOUT IT! COME ON!

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:52.593
HEY!

01:29:57.998 --> 01:30:00.866
      OW, OW! NO, OW, OW!

01:30:02.702 --> 01:30:04.101
NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:30:04.103 --> 01:30:06.035
EASY, KITTY!

01:30:09.439 --> 01:30:11.106
NO!

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:17.945
NOBODY MOVE.

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.649
AH-AH-AH-CHOO!

01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:23.650
NO, DON'T!

01:30:26.086 --> 01:30:27.419
NO, NO.

01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:28.753
AH-AH-AH AH-CHOO!

01:30:28.887 --> 01:30:30.621
            AH-CHOO!

01:30:48.938 --> 01:30:53.007
        KILLING MONSTERS
     SURE MAKES ME HUNGRY.

01:30:53.009 --> 01:30:55.542
           WANT TO GO
      GET SOME ICE CREAM?

01:30:59.481 --> 01:31:01.781
       YEAH. LET'S DO IT.

01:31:12.558 --> 01:31:14.792
...DREW BREATH
        IN MY PRESENCE!

01:31:14.794 --> 01:31:16.093
    DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!

01:31:16.095 --> 01:31:18.028
YOU MADE A PROMISE,
           REMEMBER?

01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:19.963
YES, YES.

01:31:19.965 --> 01:31:22.532
  OH, YES, ABSOLUTELY, I DID.

01:31:22.534 --> 01:31:26.636
         I PROMISED YOU
THAT I WOULD DELIVER SIX SOULS.

01:31:26.638 --> 01:31:28.704
   AND NOW THAT THE EVENING'S
         ENTERTAINMENTS

01:31:28.706 --> 01:31:34.810
  HAVE SADLY COME TO A CLOSE,
I WILL MAKE GOOD ON MY PROMISE.

01:31:41.751 --> 01:31:43.418
I GOT IT, I GOT IT!

01:31:57.932 --> 01:31:59.631
           YOU KNOW,

01:31:59.633 --> 01:32:01.132
    FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS,

01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:03.667
I'VE BEEN HIDING IN THE SHADOWS,

01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:06.670
  HUMILIATED, WEAK, FORCED TO

01:32:06.672 --> 01:32:11.808
   STAND BY AND WATCH AS MAN
GREW MORE MALIGNANT BY THE DAY.

01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:18.881
AND, YOU KNOW, FINDING SIX SOULS
THE WORLD WOULDN'T MISS -- WELL,

01:32:18.883 --> 01:32:20.115
              BYE!

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:22.683
BYE-BYE!

01:32:25.953 --> 01:32:28.554
HEY,
   LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN LUCK.

01:32:46.973 --> 01:32:49.641
           YOU KNOW,
OUR PARENTS ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE.

01:32:49.643 --> 01:32:51.976
YEAH.

01:32:51.978 --> 01:32:54.511
        BUT I LIKE YOU.

01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:59.081
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:00.882
SO IT COULD BE WORSE.

01:33:17.832 --> 01:33:21.067
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

01:33:21.069 --> 01:33:25.971
 I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE A CHANGE
    IN YOUR NORMAL SERVICE.

01:33:25.973 --> 01:33:30.608
YOU SEE, HUMANITY CAN NO LONGER
      FUNCTION BY ITSELF.

01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:35.045
 IT'S TIME FOR THE SUPERNATURAL
     TO REJOIN THE NATURAL.

01:33:35.047 --> 01:33:40.283
 IT'S TIME FOR NEW MANAGEMENT.

01:33:40.285 --> 01:33:43.986
      YOU CAN JUST CALL ME
           THE BOSS.

01:33:43.988 --> 01:33:47.622
GET A LOAD
          OF THAT NUT.

01:33:47.624 --> 01:33:49.023
           MARJORIE!

01:34:02.068 --> 01:34:05.237
AH...

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.914
              I...

01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:19.650
            BEAT...

01:34:19.652 --> 01:34:20.951
             DEATH.
