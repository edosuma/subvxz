♪♪

00:09.980 --> 00:12.243
Oh my God,
is this really happening?

00:12.243 --> 00:13.844
Mm-hmm.
It is. It is happening.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.016
And it's real.
I'm not dreaming?

00:16.016 --> 00:18.189
Here, pinch me.
(gasps)

00:18.189 --> 00:19.950
It's not a dream!

00:19.950 --> 00:21.792
Do you know how long
I've waited for this?

00:21.792 --> 00:24.325
A year and three months,
roughly.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.097
Wait, what if something
goes wrong?

00:26.097 --> 00:28.028
I mean, every time
we've been close
to getting together,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.600
-something happens.
-Not this time.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.433
Well, what's different
this time?

00:32.433 --> 00:35.005
Oh. That.

00:35.005 --> 00:38.309
You know, I could stay here
with you all day.

00:38.309 --> 00:40.010
-I gotta go.
-What?

00:40.010 --> 00:42.873
Well, don't get me wrong,
Josh. I'm really into this,

00:42.873 --> 00:45.076
but I'm also
really into that.

00:45.076 --> 00:47.418
That thing--
the food truck.

00:47.418 --> 00:50.751
Oh, why did I help you
with your dream?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.423
Oh, it's not just that.

00:52.423 --> 00:54.785
I mean, Jake was really cool
with you and me,

00:54.785 --> 00:56.687
but leaving him
with the food truck
to cook on his own?

00:56.687 --> 00:58.629
I mean,
there's only so much coolness
a man can give.

00:58.629 --> 01:01.892
You're right.
You should definitely stay.

01:01.892 --> 01:05.065
But how about I find us
a beautiful hotel

01:05.065 --> 01:07.368
so when you're done
with that,

01:07.368 --> 01:09.700
we can start this?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.902
-Oh, I love that idea.
-You know what I love?

01:11.902 --> 01:14.905
-Making out with me?
-It's like we share a brain.

Wow, people are loving
our mushroom popovers.

01:45.706 --> 01:49.410
Yeah, till they wait an hour
and don't feel anything.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.542
Either way,
we are killing it.

01:51.542 --> 01:54.645
Best team ever.

01:54.645 --> 01:57.988
Uh, you know, professionally,
of course.

01:57.988 --> 02:01.452
Jake, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.624
Gabi, for the 10th time,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.056
I swear I'm good
with you and Josh.

02:06.056 --> 02:07.628
You're amazing.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.110
She's right.
That was amazing.

02:20.110 --> 02:21.312
What do you mean?

02:21.312 --> 02:24.475
Your performance of
"guy who's totally cool

02:24.475 --> 02:25.846
having just been dumped."

02:25.846 --> 02:28.148
Sofia, it wasn't an act.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.321
I really am cool
with Gabi and Josh.

02:30.321 --> 02:34.625
Yeah, and I'm totally cool
with Ruben dumping me again.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.628
Listen, it's just us.

02:37.628 --> 02:39.790
Tell me you haven't been
thinking about

02:39.790 --> 02:41.762
cutting the brakes
on Josh's car

02:41.762 --> 02:44.134
and having him accidentally
veer off the road

02:44.134 --> 02:45.636
to run over Ruben.

02:45.636 --> 02:48.068
What? No!

02:48.068 --> 02:50.801
You were just dumped.
How can you be so nice?

02:50.801 --> 02:53.274
I feel happy that other people
are happy.

02:53.274 --> 02:56.146
(blows raspberry)

02:56.146 --> 02:59.610
Sofia, I lived with monks
in Nepal for a year.

02:59.610 --> 03:03.214
"My religion is kindness."
So says the Dalai Lama.

03:03.214 --> 03:07.488
Yeah? Well, my religion is,
you cut me, I cut you deeper.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.390
So says the Li'l SoSo.

03:16.627 --> 03:19.970
Okay, who's ready
to salvage our honeymoon

03:19.970 --> 03:22.473
with a "staycation"
at the Four Seasons?

03:22.473 --> 03:25.205
Me! I am!

03:25.205 --> 03:27.037
I love my new husband.

03:27.037 --> 03:29.540
That's your suitcase?

03:29.540 --> 03:32.082
I thought
you used a sardine can
like Stuart Little.

03:32.082 --> 03:35.746
(laughing)
Oh! That wasn't good.

03:35.746 --> 03:37.718
Yoyo, is your back okay?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.890
Oh, it's just a little pinch.
I'll be fine.

03:39.890 --> 03:41.151
Ah!

03:41.151 --> 03:42.493
Let me help.

03:42.493 --> 03:44.094
My cousin's
a chiropractor.

03:44.094 --> 03:45.996
He taught me
a little trick.

03:45.996 --> 03:47.498
-(back cracking)
-Ah! Oh my damn!

03:47.498 --> 03:49.960
I think that's my T7!

03:49.960 --> 03:52.202
Oh! There went my L5!

03:52.202 --> 03:54.535
I'm so sorry.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.707
No wonder my cousin
now works at Urban Outfitters.

03:56.707 --> 03:59.009
If we leave now,

03:59.009 --> 04:01.942
we can catch
the complementary
mimosa brunch. Let's go!

04:01.942 --> 04:04.445
-What?
-What?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.176
Our friend
has just been hurt,

04:06.176 --> 04:08.178
and by my own hands.
We can't just leave her.

04:08.178 --> 04:10.451
Of course we can.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.283
She's the one
who can't walk, not us.

04:12.283 --> 04:14.525
-Come on.
-Are you serious?

04:14.525 --> 04:16.857
Your friend's in need
and you just want
to abandon her

04:16.857 --> 04:18.489
like garbage
on the side of the road?

04:18.489 --> 04:21.492
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you've gone too far.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.093
She is not my friend.

04:26.897 --> 04:29.069
-(bass beat blaring)
-Aw, sweet tent!

04:29.069 --> 04:30.771
Ain't she a beaut?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.573
Is that for you
and Gabi tonight?

04:32.573 --> 04:36.076
Oh, this tent?

04:36.076 --> 04:39.109
Oh, it's not just
for me and Gabi.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.111
Anyone can use it, really.
It's a necessities one.

04:41.111 --> 04:42.953
There's-- look, you know,
all the hotels in Coachella--

04:42.953 --> 04:45.285
Josh, I'm cool
with you and Gabi.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.957
Really, man?
Are you sure?

04:46.957 --> 04:49.089
Because, Jake,
I would feel terrible
if there were any--

04:49.089 --> 04:50.721
There isn't.
Josh, it's all good.

04:50.721 --> 04:51.922
We're good.

04:51.922 --> 04:54.264
Good.

04:54.264 --> 04:56.927
Something else
on your mind?

04:56.927 --> 04:59.700
No! No, I mean,
I'm good, man.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.633
It's just... I'm kind of
freaking out about tonight.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.375
What's the problem?

05:04.375 --> 05:06.377
I mean, I'm usually fine
with this kind of stuff.

05:06.377 --> 05:09.710
This "kind of stuff,"
meaning being with a woman?

05:09.710 --> 05:13.714
Well, not just any woman.
It's Gabi.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.116
Jake, I've never felt
like this about anyone.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.849
And we've been so close
so many times,

05:18.849 --> 05:21.321
I don't want to blow it.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.925
Oh. Now I get it.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.927
Performance anxiety.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.328
Yes! Wait, what?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.861
I mean, the last thing
you need

05:30.861 --> 05:33.303
is a premature
"e-Josh-ulation."

05:33.303 --> 05:35.606
No!

05:35.606 --> 05:38.168
No, no, no. That's not
what I'm talking about.

05:38.168 --> 05:41.211
Okay. So what are you
talking about then?

05:41.211 --> 05:43.243
The relationship stuff.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.516
The sex stuff?
Not the sex stuff!

05:45.516 --> 05:47.177
I'm not talking
about the sex stuff.

05:47.177 --> 05:48.849
There'll be no problem
with sex stuff.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.851
But if I suddenly thought
it could be a problem,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.523
what were you going to say?

05:52.523 --> 05:55.556
Oh, just in situations
where you're afraid

05:55.556 --> 05:57.327
you'll finish
before you get started,

05:57.327 --> 06:00.160
there is a numbing spray
that you could just put on
down there--

06:00.160 --> 06:02.563
Okay!

06:02.563 --> 06:04.695
No. Thank you,
but not in a million years

06:04.695 --> 06:06.397
would I ever need
something like that.

06:06.397 --> 06:08.899
But if I suddenly thought
I would need it,

06:08.899 --> 06:11.071
where would I buy it?

06:14.575 --> 06:18.749
My date with Josh
is going to be romantic
and magical.

06:18.749 --> 06:21.111
"Romantagical."

06:21.111 --> 06:23.754
Well, I'm very excited
for you

06:23.754 --> 06:26.156
even though
I am bummed and depressed--

06:26.156 --> 06:27.958
"bumpressed."

06:27.958 --> 06:32.463
So what are you
going to wear on this
"romantagical" evening?

06:32.463 --> 06:33.564
This.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.826
Oh, plus my red
hamburger print undies

06:35.826 --> 06:37.728
that say "cute buns"
on the back.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.099
Oh.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.902
Why "oh"?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.905
You didn't bring
anything sexier?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.137
Sofia, Josh and I
are starting a relationship.

06:47.137 --> 06:48.639
I think we go
a little bit deeper

06:48.639 --> 06:50.210
than caring
about what we wear.

06:50.210 --> 06:54.284
Oh, that being said,
I showered a tweezed.
"Shweezed."

06:54.284 --> 06:56.817
Mmm. Well, you know what?
I think you're right.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.850
Josh doesn't care
if your undies match
because you're a match.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.292
Right? I mean,
I could probably wear
a poncho and he wouldn't care.

07:02.292 --> 07:04.795
(laughs)
You probably could.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.797
But don't!

07:08.899 --> 07:10.130
"Numb-Numb.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.804
"De-sensitizing spray
for men.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.537
Works within minutes,
lasts four to six hours."

07:16.537 --> 07:18.108
Hours are good.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.374
(spraying)

07:24.374 --> 07:26.216
One more for good luck.

07:26.216 --> 07:30.581
(long spray)

07:30.581 --> 07:32.753
Ooh, this is good.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.685
Tingly.

07:34.685 --> 07:37.087
-Knock knock!
-Hey, beautiful.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.030
-Hi.
-Mwah! Ta-dah!

07:40.030 --> 07:43.734
Oh my God, I love it!
This is incredible.

07:43.734 --> 07:47.598
I actually have a bit
of a lesser surprise
for you too.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.269
Oh, amazing.
Open it.

07:49.269 --> 07:54.044
Gabi, hey, I know a tent
isn't every girl's dream,

07:54.044 --> 07:56.777
but... you're not every girl.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.079
Aw! And you're not every guy.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.053
Tonight is going to be
so... fun.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.455
Oh my God!

08:05.455 --> 08:07.057
Are you okay?

08:07.057 --> 08:09.860
Fine.
Didn't feel a thing.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.522
Mmm.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.193
Nothing.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.827
Good, because I don't want
anything to ruin this night.

08:16.827 --> 08:17.868
Uh-oh.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.571
Uh-oh, what?

08:20.571 --> 08:22.833
Uh-oh, I just don't
want you to think

08:22.833 --> 08:24.705
that we're moving too fast,
you know?

08:24.705 --> 08:27.778
'Cause if you want me
to slow it down,
I totally get it.

08:27.778 --> 08:30.941
I'm fine, but I love
that you're so sensitive.

08:30.941 --> 08:32.713
Actually, I'm not.

08:32.713 --> 08:36.246
May our feelings
continue to grow.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.148
God willing.

08:39.790 --> 08:42.352
Can you believe
that we're finally together?

08:42.352 --> 08:44.855
(giggling)

08:44.855 --> 08:47.127
No, I can't feel it
at all--

08:47.127 --> 08:48.999
believe it at all.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.662
So what do you want
to do now?

08:51.662 --> 08:53.704
You know what I want to do?

08:53.704 --> 08:55.706
-What?
-Talk.

08:55.706 --> 08:59.710
Let's talk for about
four to six hours.

09:04.975 --> 09:08.548
(gasps) Gabi?
Is that you?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.350
Yep.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.823
Tell me everything
that happened last night!

09:12.823 --> 09:15.285
Well, we talked.

09:15.285 --> 09:17.327
-Uh-huh?
-And we cuddled.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.933
Gabi?
You left out the sex part.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.265
Yeah, so did he!

09:25.265 --> 09:26.366
What?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.998
There was no sex part.

09:27.998 --> 09:31.842
Oh! I hate it when guys
just want to talk and cuddle.

09:31.842 --> 09:34.104
It's like,
"I've got needs, bitch."

09:34.104 --> 09:36.647
I wanted it to be
really special,

09:36.647 --> 09:39.810
and I was open
to wherever things went,
but they went nowhere.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.982
I should have
taken your advice
and stepped up my game.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.314
-Oh.
-But he asked me
to hang out again tonight,

09:44.314 --> 09:46.617
and I am not making
the same mistake twice.

09:46.617 --> 09:48.588
Hell, yeah, you're not!
You're gonna bring it.

09:48.588 --> 09:53.263
-What are you gonna bring?
-I don't know.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.425
Thoughts, input, advice?

09:55.425 --> 09:58.729
Well, what Ruben
always liked

09:58.729 --> 10:00.771
was leaving me
for another woman.

10:00.771 --> 10:03.403
So don't ask me.
Ask him.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.405
I can't ask him.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.037
I need a guy
I didn't just date

10:07.037 --> 10:08.779
and a guy who's not
my guy's brother.

10:08.779 --> 10:10.410
Yeah, but maybe
your guy's brother

10:10.410 --> 10:11.782
will know something
about your guy

10:11.782 --> 10:13.383
because they're brothers.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.318
Hey. Just ask me.

10:25.095 --> 10:27.157
Okay, fine.

10:27.157 --> 10:30.330
If a girl was
going to be with a guy,

10:30.330 --> 10:33.363
and she really wanted
to bring it...

10:34.604 --> 10:37.367
what exactly
would she bring?

10:38.669 --> 10:41.611
Are you asking me
how to bring it to Josh?

10:41.611 --> 10:43.173
No!

10:43.173 --> 10:44.775
(whispering)
Maybe.

10:44.775 --> 10:46.877
Well...

10:48.679 --> 10:50.650
I don't know
if I should be
telling you this,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.824
but I do know one thing
Josh likes to be brung.

10:57.427 --> 10:58.859
What?

10:58.859 --> 11:02.262
I did not know this
about him. Shut up!

11:02.262 --> 11:04.394
Keep talking.

11:08.538 --> 11:12.142
Ooh, my back kept me up
all night.

11:12.142 --> 11:14.174
Let me give you
a massage, Yolanda.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.507
We're going to cater
to your every need.

11:17.507 --> 11:20.350
See? Look at that
beautiful sandwich
Elliot made.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.856
-Elliot?
-What? You want half?

11:25.856 --> 11:27.617
No, but Yolanda might.

11:27.617 --> 11:31.221
Oh, please,
you've never eaten half
of anything.

11:31.221 --> 11:35.165
Excuse my rude husband,
Yolanda.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.997
I'm not being rude.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.830
I'm taking care of her,
like you asked.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.431
This is taking care of her?

11:41.431 --> 11:43.734
Yes. If we coddle her,

11:43.734 --> 11:46.236
we're just encouraging her
to be injured.

11:46.236 --> 11:49.009
Where did you learn that?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.510
From my mom.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.743
When we were sick,
she'd take away our pillows

11:52.743 --> 11:54.745
and give them back
when we got better.

11:54.745 --> 11:56.787
That was our reward.

11:56.787 --> 11:58.849
(cell phone ringing)

11:58.849 --> 12:00.390
Oh, that's the pharmacy.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.292
Yolanda's muscle relaxants
are ready.

12:02.292 --> 12:05.395
-I'm gonna pick them up.
-Oh, and get some aspirin.

12:05.395 --> 12:08.959
Yolanda's complaining
is giving me a migraine.

12:08.959 --> 12:12.002
Can I just say
one thing?

12:12.002 --> 12:14.765
If this is how you treat
someone who's like family,

12:14.765 --> 12:17.607
God forbid I ever get sick.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.242
Oh God, Yolanda,

12:22.242 --> 12:25.916
now Alan thinks
I'm an uncaring monster.

12:33.123 --> 12:34.925
Gabi:
Hi, Josh.

12:34.925 --> 12:39.229
Gabi, hey.
So about last night,

12:39.229 --> 12:41.131
you know when
you go and see a movie
for the first time

12:41.131 --> 12:42.893
and it's kind of a let-down,
but then you go and see it

12:42.893 --> 12:44.494
a second time
and you love it?

12:44.494 --> 12:47.037
Why would you
pay to see a movie
you didn't like again?

12:49.699 --> 12:53.743
Never mind. I was trying
to make an analogy
about last night.

12:53.743 --> 12:56.076
Why don't we forget
about last night?

12:56.076 --> 12:58.909
I would like that very much.

12:58.909 --> 13:00.981
You know
what helps people forget?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.552
Drinks.

13:02.552 --> 13:03.683
Big ones.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.817
All right,
so I was thinking martinis.

13:06.817 --> 13:09.289
Uh, I also have
some tequila.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.261
-What do you think?
-(whip lashes)

13:14.694 --> 13:16.827
Wow.

13:16.827 --> 13:19.129
Oh.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.672
What are you doing?

13:22.672 --> 13:24.274
Oh, I know you likey.

13:24.274 --> 13:27.107
I know all your fantasies,
Joshua.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.780
And I'm gonna
make them come true!

13:30.780 --> 13:32.682
Ow, God.

13:32.682 --> 13:34.985
Why do you like this?

13:34.985 --> 13:36.816
I don't!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.588
Hey, give me back
my spanky thingy.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.521
Gabi, what is going on?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.523
That's what I want to know!

13:43.523 --> 13:46.126
I mean, last night,
you couldn't have been
less interested in me.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.799
And tonight,
I do your favorite thing
and you want me to stop.

13:49.799 --> 13:51.801
I mean, what is it, Josh?
Is it me?

13:51.801 --> 13:53.433
Does my breath smell?

13:53.433 --> 13:55.635
No, no, no, no!
Don't--

13:55.635 --> 13:58.638
(sprays)

13:58.638 --> 14:00.370
Ugh!

14:00.370 --> 14:02.072
(lisping)
What is this stuff?

14:03.373 --> 14:05.876
Why is my tongue
doing this?

14:07.417 --> 14:08.879
That's, uh...

14:08.879 --> 14:11.051
numbing spray.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.423
Why would you use this stuff?

14:13.423 --> 14:16.326
It was Jake.
He got in my head.

14:16.326 --> 14:18.858
He made me worry
about my... endurance.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.690
Jake?

14:20.690 --> 14:23.833
He's also the one
who told me you like this!

14:23.833 --> 14:27.337
Oh my god!

14:27.337 --> 14:29.839
How didn't I see this?

14:29.839 --> 14:32.072
He's trying to sabotage
our relationship.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.573
What?

14:33.573 --> 14:36.406
(lisping)
Nobody sabotages
our relationship but us.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.608
-Ow! Please stop!
-I'm sorry.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.257
Jake?

14:47.257 --> 14:50.760
You and the Dalai Lama
would be very proud of me.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.592
I just sent Ruben an email

14:52.592 --> 14:54.864
wishing him and his girlfriend
nothing but happiness.

14:54.864 --> 14:56.526
Oh, good for you.

14:56.526 --> 14:58.268
Yeah.
Uh, one little question--

14:58.268 --> 15:00.800
when do I start
feeling better?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.103
Jake, we need to talk.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.475
Now!

15:05.475 --> 15:08.278
(lisping)
Yeah. Explain this.

15:08.278 --> 15:10.110
Oh, so you bought the stuff?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.741
Yeah, the stuff
you told me to buy!

15:11.741 --> 15:14.284
Yeah, and why did you tell me
he was into S&M?

15:14.284 --> 15:16.146
-'Cause he is.
-No, I'm not.

15:16.146 --> 15:19.189
Yes, you are.
Remember the Melanie girl
you dated in college?

15:19.189 --> 15:21.521
The one with a shark tattoo
who ruled at hacky sack?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.753
She was into it
and you couldn't
shut up about it.

15:23.753 --> 15:26.096
Sure know a lot
about Melanie.

15:26.096 --> 15:28.498
Want to know why?
You dated her!

15:28.498 --> 15:31.962
What? No.
Oh my God, it was me.

15:31.962 --> 15:34.404
That's weird.
Why did I think it was you?

15:34.404 --> 15:36.906
Because you're not
the Dalai Lama.

15:36.906 --> 15:39.169
You're a human being
with feelings.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.610
Ha ha! I knew it!

15:40.610 --> 15:42.612
And you were subconsciously
trying to get even

15:42.612 --> 15:45.615
with Josh and Gabi
because you're secretly
mad they're together.

15:45.615 --> 15:48.278
No, that--
that is ridiculous.

15:48.278 --> 15:50.450
(lisping)
Is it, Jake? Is it?

15:51.721 --> 15:53.323
Jake, you said
you were cool with everything.

15:53.323 --> 15:54.684
I am!

15:56.256 --> 16:00.190
But maybe, down deep,
I am kinda mad.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.932
I mean, when you think about,
it wasn't very cool

16:02.932 --> 16:05.095
what you did--
you acted all generous,

16:05.095 --> 16:07.097
sent me down here with Gabi,
then showed up

16:07.097 --> 16:09.199
and told her that
you have feelings for her?

16:09.199 --> 16:11.301
You totally backstabbed me.

16:11.301 --> 16:13.743
Good. Open your heart.
Let the hate out.

16:13.743 --> 16:16.746
And then--
and then you choose him.

16:16.746 --> 16:18.348
And I have to listen
to you guys

16:18.348 --> 16:19.849
come up to me
and ask me questions

16:19.849 --> 16:21.881
about how to make
each other feel good!

16:21.881 --> 16:24.684
It totally sucks!

16:28.558 --> 16:30.890
(whispering) Wow.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.424
A lot of anger there.

16:34.424 --> 16:37.667
I got layers. Oh!

16:37.667 --> 16:41.331
You're right...
about everything.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.504
I was so wrapped up
in myself

16:44.504 --> 16:46.476
that I didn't think
about you.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.838
I should have been
a better brother.

16:48.838 --> 16:50.180
And I'm sorry.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.343
(lisping)
I'm sorry too.

16:53.343 --> 16:55.345
We suck.

16:56.786 --> 16:58.017
Hugs?

17:00.950 --> 17:03.393
You too, Sofia.

17:09.499 --> 17:12.732
I can't believe it!
My honeymoon's a bust

17:12.732 --> 17:15.065
and now Alan hates me.

17:15.065 --> 17:17.507
Could this get any worse?

17:17.507 --> 17:19.038
I have to go
to the bathroom.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.413
Fine.

17:23.413 --> 17:25.575
Let's get you up.
Give me your hands.

17:25.575 --> 17:27.917
Come on, you can do this.
(grunting)

17:27.917 --> 17:29.919
Ah! Okay, I'm up.

17:29.919 --> 17:31.781
But I don't know
if I could walk.

17:31.781 --> 17:34.754
You want this?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.056
I'm not a dog.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.888
But I do want it!

17:38.888 --> 17:42.892
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
I can't-- I can't do this.

17:42.892 --> 17:47.066
(inhaling)
Mmm, nougat.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.870
Damn it, I love nougat!

17:50.870 --> 17:53.243
-Ow, ow, ow.
-Right foot, left foot.
Come on.

17:53.243 --> 17:56.406
-Come on.
-I can't believe
this is working.

17:58.748 --> 18:02.812
-(door closes)
-Yolanda: Aren't you going
to lower me on the bowl?

18:07.056 --> 18:10.220
Thanks, Elliot!
I'm sorry I messed up
your honeymoon.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.893
I'm sorry for being
so cold when you got hurt.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.626
Maybe that's what I love
about Alan.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.628
He makes me a better person.

18:18.628 --> 18:20.770
Oh my God.
I can't believe

18:20.770 --> 18:23.633
I ever doubted you,
my Asian Florence Nightingale.

18:23.633 --> 18:25.875
-I love you.
-And I love you.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.977
Good. So will you
do something for me?

18:27.977 --> 18:29.309
Anything. What?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.141
-Yolanda: All done!
-That.

18:31.141 --> 18:32.742
Bye!

18:35.915 --> 18:40.320
Well, at least we got
our first awkward bondage
experience out of the way.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.823
Hey, I said "first,"
and then I said "said."

18:43.823 --> 18:45.955
Hey, high five for getting
our feeling back

18:45.955 --> 18:48.358
to all of our proper places.

18:48.358 --> 18:52.302
You know, I actually do
have a fantasy.

18:52.302 --> 18:53.963
You do?

18:53.963 --> 18:56.306
Mm-hmm.
I want to do it...

18:56.306 --> 18:57.707
Yeah?

18:57.707 --> 18:59.339
(whispering)
...in your bed.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.212
Keep going.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.414
That's it.

19:04.414 --> 19:06.376
I mean, the first time
we did it, we didn't
know each other,

19:06.376 --> 19:08.378
we were drunk,
and we didn't even
remember it.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.380
My fantasy
is a total do-over.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.552
I love it.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.784
We can leave
as soon as you're done
with the food truck.

19:14.784 --> 19:16.886
Oh, but we already
sold out of everything.

19:16.886 --> 19:18.428
Great. Let's leave
first thing in the morning.

19:18.428 --> 19:19.859
Or we could leave right now.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.493
-It's like we share a brain.
-Go!

19:23.493 --> 19:27.697
Thanks for staying
and helping me drive
the truck back.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.199
Oh, we are break-up buddies.

19:29.199 --> 19:31.241
I would not leave you
in the dust.

19:31.241 --> 19:34.404
Turns out you were right.
Being dumped is the worst.

19:34.404 --> 19:36.246
There are certain things
you can do to move on.

19:36.246 --> 19:39.279
Mmm, yeah?
Like what?

19:39.279 --> 19:42.051
Crying, eating,

19:42.051 --> 19:43.753
long bubble bath.

19:43.753 --> 19:48.017
What about rebound sex?

19:48.017 --> 19:50.460
(snorts) Jake.

19:50.460 --> 19:54.794
That is so soulless.
It's empty and sad.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.796
And--
oh, you mean with me?

19:56.796 --> 20:00.600
Yeah,
unless you don't want to--

20:17.317 --> 20:18.648
Oh my God, did we--

20:18.648 --> 20:20.650
We did not.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.322
Are you sure?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.454
So sure.

20:27.657 --> 20:29.959
We must have been so tired,
we passed out.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.200
Huh.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.703
Hey, maybe it's not
a bad thing.

20:33.703 --> 20:35.665
You know, if we're going
to have a do-over,

20:35.665 --> 20:37.707
we might as well do it right.

20:37.707 --> 20:40.009
We're going on a date tonight--
a real date.

20:40.009 --> 20:42.342
Oh, I would love that.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.544
I mean, I'll have to
ask my boss first,

20:44.544 --> 20:46.676
but I think he might
say yes.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.788
Mmm.

20:58.788 --> 21:02.091
Mmm. (laughs)

21:04.233 --> 21:06.396
Sofia, are you awake?

21:06.396 --> 21:08.237
What?

21:09.899 --> 21:11.601
Oh, hi.

21:11.601 --> 21:14.404
-Did we--
-We did.

21:14.404 --> 21:17.307
-You sure?
-So sure.

21:17.307 --> 21:19.509
You want to do it again?

21:20.650 --> 21:22.652
Don't ask stupid questions.
