[Stanley] [hums]

00:34.440 --> 00:35.320
Wow!

00:35.640 --> 00:37.040
-Yeah!
-Hey!

00:37.199 --> 00:39.360
-Oopsie!
-You'll never believe it.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.680
In Malaysia, they just spotted
the Rajah Brooke Butterfly!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
The Ra--whatterfly?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.040
This one!

00:47.199 --> 00:49.080
Wow! It's huge!

00:49.239 --> 00:52.080
That butterfly
gets an ooh and an ahh.

00:52.239 --> 00:54.320
Plus and extra ooh.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.760
It is beautiful.
And super rare in the wild!

00:57.919 --> 00:59.279
But the best part...

00:59.599 --> 01:00.480
Look!

01:00.559 --> 01:02.599
It's the only butterfly missing

01:02.760 --> 01:05.360
from my Explorer's Club
photo collection!

01:05.440 --> 01:08.000
And if I get this last picture,
I get

01:08.240 --> 01:10.200
the Butterfly Badge!

01:10.360 --> 01:13.399
Wow!
What an amazing album, Ollie.

01:13.679 --> 01:15.000
Hey! Be careful!

01:15.080 --> 01:15.960
Sorry!

01:16.160 --> 01:17.240
But guess what?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.880
I'm having
a butterfly brainstorm!

01:20.039 --> 01:21.440
Let's go to Malaysia,

01:21.600 --> 01:23.440
and get a photo
with the whatterfly.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.280
It would be great
to get my Butterfly Badge.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.560
No one
has ever gotten one before!

01:28.720 --> 01:29.640
Then, come on!

01:29.960 --> 01:31.440
I'll get
your butterfly binoculars.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
No!

01:33.399 --> 01:34.280
Hi-yah!

01:35.479 --> 01:36.360
Hum.

01:36.440 --> 01:37.960
Oh, right...

01:38.360 --> 01:39.320
Finger paint!

01:39.479 --> 01:40.640
Thanks, Stanley.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.399
My binoculars
are really important to me.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.880
And my hat.

01:44.960 --> 01:45.800
[Ollie] Hmm.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.520
Maybe we shouldn't go.

01:47.600 --> 01:48.479
Too risky.

01:48.559 --> 01:49.920
Don't worry, Ollie.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.399
If you want to get this picture,
I will personally volunteer

01:53.479 --> 01:56.280
to be the bodyguard
for your binoculars!

01:56.440 --> 01:57.360
Hahh!

01:58.080 --> 02:00.199
Haaaah! Hm.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.199
Really? Then you know what?

02:04.360 --> 02:05.720
Let's do it!

02:05.800 --> 02:07.160
Let's go to Malaysia!

02:07.320 --> 02:10.239
Yay! Whatterfly, here we come!

02:10.519 --> 02:11.799
Hi-yahhh!

02:19.880 --> 02:21.519
Wheee!

02:28.959 --> 02:32.720
<i>Welcome to Malaysia. Yay!</i>

02:39.040 --> 02:40.320
Woah.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.000
It's not just the butterflies
that are huge in Malaysia.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.480
Look at those towers!

02:47.120 --> 02:49.440
Those must be
the Petronas Towers.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.679
So that means,

02:50.760 --> 02:52.640
we are... here!

02:52.799 --> 02:55.679
Now, which bus to take...

02:55.840 --> 02:57.239
While you look at your map,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.519
I'm going to practice
my butterfly.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.799
Swoop!

03:00.959 --> 03:02.079
Flit!

03:02.239 --> 03:03.799
Wave, wave.

03:03.959 --> 03:05.320
Sparkle...

03:05.480 --> 03:06.640
And flutter!

03:06.720 --> 03:07.600
Hah!

03:07.760 --> 03:09.799
Ma'am, I need you to take
three steps back.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.440
-Hm.
-What? Why?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.920
Sorry, Moon.
After that paint scare,

03:14.079 --> 03:15.640
I can't take any chances.

03:15.799 --> 03:17.720
But I was just playing!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.120
Mm hmm.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.079
Uh, oh fine.

03:21.239 --> 03:22.480
One...

03:22.640 --> 03:24.160
two... three...

03:24.320 --> 03:25.799
-Hi!
-Ahh!

03:25.959 --> 03:27.239
Are you looking
for something? Let me help!

[bird squawk]

03:31.399 --> 03:32.480
[frog ribbit]

03:32.640 --> 03:35.000
Here you go!
This is way better than a map.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.519
[gasps] How'd you do that?

03:36.679 --> 03:38.679
More like, why did you do that?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.720
[chuckles] Because it's fun.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.119
I'm Tuah.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.000
I'm Moon
and that's Ollie and Stanley.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.959
Want to have some more fun?

03:50.040 --> 03:53.320
We could go play on the hugest
leaves in the whole world!

03:53.480 --> 03:56.560
You have huge leaves here too?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.280
What a great place!

03:59.320 --> 04:00.600
[honking horn]

04:00.760 --> 04:02.440
Guys, this is our bus!

04:02.519 --> 04:04.399
Got to go, Tuah.
Nice to meet you!

04:04.560 --> 04:06.239
But, don't you want to play?

04:06.399 --> 04:07.760
Hah! Foo-foo!

04:07.839 --> 04:08.679
Negative.

04:08.839 --> 04:10.320
Not right now, thanks.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.760
Sure! Maybe later?

04:11.920 --> 04:12.760
OK!

04:12.920 --> 04:13.880
Later!

04:18.560 --> 04:19.719
Here it is.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.880
The place where the butterfly
was last spotted.

04:23.039 --> 04:25.320
Stanley, my binoculars, please.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.680
Hm.

04:34.719 --> 04:35.760
Now,

04:35.920 --> 04:38.440
where could that butterfly...

04:38.640 --> 04:39.520
be?

04:39.599 --> 04:41.919
Hey, Ollie! Can I have a turn
with your binoculars?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.200
Huh? Can I, Ollie?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.599
Ollie!

04:44.760 --> 04:47.200
Please?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.960
Sir, is this cat bothering you?

04:49.120 --> 04:50.919
It's OK. You can use them, Moon.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.960
But, you have to promise
to be careful--

04:54.120 --> 04:55.000
OK thanks, Ollie!

04:59.200 --> 05:00.360
Hold on.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.200
They're the wrong way around.
Whoop!

05:02.360 --> 05:03.280
No!

05:03.440 --> 05:04.479
-Not like that!
-Ahh!

05:05.280 --> 05:06.680
Stop playing around, Moon.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.240
Give them back!

05:08.960 --> 05:10.200
[gasps] Hey!

05:10.280 --> 05:12.760
I can see those huge leaves
Tuah was talking about!

05:12.919 --> 05:14.680
Wow! [giggles]

05:14.760 --> 05:15.640
Oops.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.640
No!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.320
Oh no, the case!

05:24.479 --> 05:26.479
It's scratched!

05:26.640 --> 05:27.960
[Moon] I'm sorry, Ollie.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.400
I didn't mean to.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.440
Why can't
you be more careful, Moon?

05:31.599 --> 05:34.680
Well, I was just leaving
to go play in the huge leaves.

05:35.000 --> 05:35.840
Good idea.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Sure is.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.240
Enjoy your playing.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.680
Enjoy your binoculars.

05:40.680 --> 05:41.760
See you later.

05:41.919 --> 05:43.680
Bye.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.440
Moon's always playing around
when she shouldn't be.

05:46.599 --> 05:48.039
Huh, Stanley?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.359
-Stanley?
-Psst.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.039
-Mm hmm?
-Ollie, over here!

05:52.120 --> 05:54.400
[Stanley] I found a secret
butterfly watching spot.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.599
Nice!

05:55.680 --> 05:59.400
Hold on. I don't want to ruin
my special Explorer's Club hat.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.719
Allow me.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.719
[gusts of wind]

06:11.080 --> 06:12.120
Wow.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.200
These leaves are huge!

06:15.359 --> 06:16.640
Wahoo!

06:16.800 --> 06:18.919
Hey Moon, it's later!

06:19.080 --> 06:20.200
Want to play now?

06:20.359 --> 06:21.240
Tuah!

06:21.400 --> 06:22.760
What are you doing here?

06:22.919 --> 06:24.560
I really wanted to play
with you earlier

06:24.719 --> 06:25.760
so I came here to find you.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.599
Aren't these leaves fun?

06:27.760 --> 06:28.719
Yeah.

06:28.799 --> 06:31.400
I wish Ollie
would have some fun too.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.680
[sighs]

06:32.840 --> 06:34.159
But he's too busy
being worried

06:34.320 --> 06:36.039
about his binoculars
and his...

06:36.200 --> 06:37.320
[gasps] Oh, no!

06:37.479 --> 06:39.359
Special explorer's hat, stop!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.359
Come back!

06:42.520 --> 06:43.880
Good, a new game!

06:44.039 --> 06:46.039
Fun! [chuckles]

06:47.599 --> 06:49.240
Woah!

06:49.400 --> 06:50.960
Did you spot the butterfly?

06:51.120 --> 06:52.719
Not a butterfly. Moon!

06:52.880 --> 06:55.320
She's having so much fun
playing around out there,

06:55.479 --> 06:57.159
she's forgetting to be careful.

06:57.479 --> 06:59.320
Like always.

07:03.479 --> 07:05.479
Ahhh!

07:05.640 --> 07:07.120
Whee!

07:07.440 --> 07:08.840
Wait up, hat!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.440
Ooh, this is a fun game, Moon.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.200
I bet you I catch it first!

07:13.359 --> 07:14.400
I bet you I do!

07:15.359 --> 07:16.200
Woah!

07:16.359 --> 07:17.280
Oops!

07:17.359 --> 07:18.960
Aw, missed it.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.400
Wahoo!

07:23.400 --> 07:24.719
Nnn-yah!

07:24.880 --> 07:26.680
Got it. Hooray!

07:26.840 --> 07:28.200
But not for long!

07:28.359 --> 07:30.159
I'm coming in for the steal!

07:30.880 --> 07:31.840
[chuckles]

07:32.000 --> 07:33.320
Wahoo!

07:33.479 --> 07:35.680
Got it!
One point for me!

07:35.840 --> 07:37.880
[giggles]
Good thing we caught it.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.000
Can I have it now?

07:43.960 --> 07:46.640
That's Ollie's special hat.
If anything happened to it...

07:47.960 --> 07:49.400
Let's keep playing.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.799
Who can juggle it the longest?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.919
No, Tuah! Stop playing around.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.599
Give it back!

07:55.760 --> 07:56.599
Whoops.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.120
Oh no!

07:59.159 --> 08:00.919
Any sign of the butterfly?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.840
Hmm. Not yet...

08:03.000 --> 08:05.560
But now Moon's headed
toward the water!

08:05.719 --> 08:08.599
Oh, good.
She's wearing a life jacket.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.120
Still,
I wish she'd be more careful

08:11.280 --> 08:13.640
'cause I can get a new pair
of binoculars,

08:13.799 --> 08:15.400
but not a new Moon.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.840
She <i>is </i> one of a kind.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.640
[gasps]
Just like the whatterfly!

08:19.799 --> 08:21.400
There it is!

08:21.840 --> 08:23.560
Wow.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.359
[quick breaths]

08:28.719 --> 08:30.120
Er, I've almost...

08:30.280 --> 08:31.320
got it...

08:31.479 --> 08:33.919
[Tuah] Oh, good! Another game.

08:34.079 --> 08:34.959
[giggles]

08:35.120 --> 08:36.000
No!

08:39.959 --> 08:43.360
Tuah, I need you to take
three scooches back from the hat.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.079
One, two, three.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.079
But, don't you want to play?

08:48.240 --> 08:49.240
Always!

08:49.319 --> 08:50.840
But I have to be careful
with this.

08:51.079 --> 08:52.439
It isn't mine.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.520
Sorry, Moon. Are you mad at me?

08:55.680 --> 08:56.600
No way!

08:56.680 --> 08:58.160
We had a lot of fun.

08:58.319 --> 09:00.760
But let's not get carried away,
OK?

09:00.920 --> 09:03.079
I tend to get carried away.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.280
It landed over there.

09:06.439 --> 09:08.040
It's gigantic!

09:08.199 --> 09:11.760
Just two little steps more...

09:12.520 --> 09:14.520
Easy...

09:14.680 --> 09:18.560
[Stanley] Easy...

09:18.720 --> 09:20.839
-Hey there, Ollie!
-Moon!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.600
-Your hat blew away.
-But Moon caught it!

09:23.760 --> 09:25.680
Wait, what? My hat blew away?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.640
[gasps]

09:28.920 --> 09:30.240
So you
weren't playing out there,

09:30.400 --> 09:31.560
you were saving my hat?

09:31.720 --> 09:32.760
Wahow!

09:32.920 --> 09:34.600
You should be the hat bodyguard!

09:34.760 --> 09:36.839
Oh Moon, that's so nice of you.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.720
It's the least I could do.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.280
I'm sorry I wasn't more careful
with your binoculars, Ollie.

09:42.439 --> 09:43.760
It's OK, Moon.

09:43.920 --> 09:47.120
Friends are way more important
than stuff.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.199
