WEBVTT

00:25.150 --> 00:26.360
You are ready?

00:27.819 --> 00:31.031
I've left this for them.
Leave it where they'll find it.

00:33.242 --> 00:37.329
The weather over London is good.
You should see the target clearly.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.553
You're gonna fly a bomb into the city.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.138
Is that what you're doing?

00:57.057 --> 01:01.436
There's a march.
Hundreds and thousands of people will die.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.315
If they do,
it's because you failed to stop us.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.817
I don't want to harm them.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.445
They are my brothers and sisters
in the fight against capitalism.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.366
The target is something the march goes by.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.743
Something they are marching against.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.248
It sticks up like a middle finger
to the poor.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.500
The Glasshouse.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.169
I'm going to break it.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.822
Come on.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.710
No.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.586
Oh, my God.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.386
No.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.227
Oh, no.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.357
No.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.713
Is that Lamb?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.756
What's he want?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.696
In a couple of hours, I've got to drive
Judd through an anti-capitalist protest

03:57.779 --> 04:01.366
to give a speech to a bunch of bankers.
It's a triple-decker shit sandwich.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.577
I don't need you out here
waving your dick for that camera.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.413
I need you to get me inside.
I mislaid my pass.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.249
-You haven't had a working pass in years.
-Yeah, well, yours will stop working

04:09.333 --> 04:13.212
when I tell Lady Di how you botched
the investigation into Harper's death.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.089
Fuck off. He cycled straight into
oncoming traffic. Open and shut.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.591
Yeah. Well, if you'd done more
than scratch the surface,

04:18.675 --> 04:22.304
you'd have found a connection
between the driver and two Russian goons

04:22.387 --> 04:23.764
who couldn't be more suspicious

04:23.847 --> 04:28.143
if they had scars running down
their cheeks and glass fucking eyes.

04:30.979 --> 04:31.980
Get in.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.611
You think I don't know how to do my job.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.366
I know you don't know how to do your job.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.495
Let's have Diana Taverner decide,
shall we?

04:47.287 --> 04:50.207
You don't even have her fucking number.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.920
We sext all the time.
Yeah, it gets quite kinky.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.929
Inside where, exactly?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.765
Where all hope goes to die.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.308
The interrogation cells?

05:09.184 --> 05:10.185
Records.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.271
Fuck it.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.899
My mistake was answering the phone.

05:15.983 --> 05:21.488
No. Your mistake
was forgetting Min Harper was one of mine.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.656
People, not profit!
People, not profit! People, not profit!

06:14.208 --> 06:15.792
Molly Doran.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.714
Jackson Lamb.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.051
The years have not been kind to you.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.804
Nor you.
I see your leg hasn't grown back.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.725
The only advantage
is I shall never have to dance with you.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.686
Christ. I'm getting your breath from here.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.732
Really? Well, I brush twice a month.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.443
Yeah, you can fuck off now.

06:41.527 --> 06:45.739
Yes. Fuck off.
I will not have the Dogs on my floor.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.578
So what the hell are you doing here,
Jackson?

06:53.288 --> 06:55.999
Nikolai Katinsky.

06:56.625 --> 07:00.295
Moscow cipher clerk.
Came over in the early '90s.

07:01.046 --> 07:05.676
Power struggles in the new FSB
meant old KGB were being purged.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.847
I need to go over his file, full rectal.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.940
-Morning.
-Morning.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.651
I don't know what these guys have planned,
but I've got your back.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.278
Yeah, thanks.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.572
Have you figured out
what their game is yet?

07:26.655 --> 07:27.948
Guess we're gonna find out.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.909
Cheers.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.417
Good morning.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.835
-Morning.
-Morning. Good night's sleep?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.503
My bed was a little cold.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.255
You should ask for a discount.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.925
-Shall we?
-Nope. Security first.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.555
Feel free.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.642
You two as well. In case you've forgotten
the rules about carrying.

08:02.941 --> 08:03.942
Thank you.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.736
No. I need to check that.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.405
It contains sensitive documents.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.575
And I have no intention
of hurting their feelings. Open it.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.591
-We accept your apology.
-Okay. Looks like we're good to go.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.681
What's he doing?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.850
I told the front desk
and his assistant that we're here.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.810
-Shall I tell him again?
-Yeah.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.285
Hello, this is Peter Judd.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.579
Please leave message,
and I'll get back to you.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.462
He's just on his way, sir.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.548
Minister.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.178
Thank you.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.224
Are you going to be able
to manage the steps

09:59.308 --> 10:00.976
at the Royal Exchange with that boot?

10:01.059 --> 10:03.020
Let me just check my phone,
then I'm all yours.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.440
-Why? You offering me your arm?
-No.

10:07.024 --> 10:07.941
Let's go.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.776
It's certainly put me off skiing.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.530
I heard you slipped
getting out of a hot tub at your chalet.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.951
A missed call from you.
Quite a few missed calls.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.703
And a message.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.163
You can ignore that.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.457
Peter. Diana Taverner here.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.043
Have you finished your toast yet?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.127
That's a keeper.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.130
Second Desk of MI5 trying to keep a lid
on her rising anger

10:30.214 --> 10:32.799
-at being treated like a common cabbie.
-I'm not angry, Peter.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.468
Home Secretary, if you don't mind.

10:34.551 --> 10:38.222
I am just trying to make sure
that you get to your speech on time.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.016
We have a security schedule to stick to.

10:41.099 --> 10:45.479
I know. And I'm sorry I made you wait,
but I was busy making you wait.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.065
Well, if that's how you get your kicks,

10:48.148 --> 10:50.609
it seems like a misuse of office to me.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.405
I really didn't appreciate it
when you came round to my house

10:55.489 --> 10:59.243
to blackmail me into getting you
off the hook for a false flag kidnapping.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.286
That I did not appreciate.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.412
Of course, at the time,

11:02.496 --> 11:05.666
I was a humble backbencher,
shit on your overpriced shoes.

11:05.749 --> 11:09.294
But now I'm not only the holder
of one of the great offices of state,

11:10.087 --> 11:12.005
I'm also your de facto boss.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.633
I think you're just as exposed as I am.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.636
We have
a mutually-assured-destruction pact.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.346
I'm not quite sure where this is leading.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.182
Well, for me it's leading to Number 10.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.986
There is a massive protest
on the streets of London this morning,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.697
and although the mood
in the crowd feels fairly benign,

11:36.780 --> 11:41.660
there's a strong sense people are worried
about a lack of government transparency.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.037
Do you think the current government
is doing enough

11:44.121 --> 11:46.707
to tackle the tax evasion and avoidance,
for example?

11:47.624 --> 11:51.170
Well, Judd claims
that the UK is leading a campaign

11:51.253 --> 11:55.632
to change the international tax system.
But I don't feel we've seen any--

11:59.720 --> 12:00.721
Have you heard from River?

12:01.555 --> 12:03.473
Not since he planted his phone
on Chernitsky.

12:04.641 --> 12:09.354
Shit. I hope he's okay
'cause it is fucking wild out there.

12:10.022 --> 12:13.483
Nevsky's dead. They injected him
with radiation. Then he shot himself.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.860
It was grim.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.571
Did you take any pictures?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.365
No, I didn't take any pictures.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.284
Next time, take some pictures.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.746
Why is Chernitsky heading into London?

12:25.829 --> 12:28.665
Maybe to sample
the best our city has to offer.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.667
Tussauds. Hard Rock Cafe.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.462
Jesus Christ, Ho.
He's a killer, and he's heading into town.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.215
I know. And we've got front-row seats.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.389
Come on.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.518
Come on. Come--

12:59.905 --> 13:00.906
Her phone.

13:25.889 --> 13:26.890
Yeah.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.773
-Alex?
-Yeah. It's me. It's Jon.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.317
-Jonny?
-I'm at the flying club. Get here now.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.027
What the fuck are you talking about?

13:39.111 --> 13:40.654
-Where's Mum?
-She's on a plane.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.948
Just come and get me now,
or you're not going to see her again.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.075
Did you g--

13:48.662 --> 13:50.914
Fuck. Come on.

14:03.093 --> 14:07.055
At the time, defectors like Katinsky
were ten a penny.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.267
Nothing really to recommend him.
He was a minnow.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.520
But this I think you'll appreciate.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.565
I heard discussion of cicadas.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.984
The man on this video

14:19.067 --> 14:22.237
is the same shambling loser
I met the other day,

14:22.321 --> 14:26.283
but he is not the same man
I spoke to on the phone tonight.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.285
What was different?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.495
He was ahead of me.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.832
So? You're well past your peak.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.711
Well, not so past it
that I can be bested by a dying minnow.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.838
Interview paused at--

14:39.922 --> 14:43.592
Which makes me wonder,
what if he's not a minnow?

14:46.178 --> 14:47.804
What if he's a whale?

14:48.430 --> 14:53.435
Do you have his defection form handy?
I need to see who signed him in.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.746
Floor 47.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.251
Comrade Pashkin.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.171
-Arkady.
-Jim Webb.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.381
How's this for a meet-cute?

16:05.716 --> 16:06.758
Meet-cute?

16:06.842 --> 16:11.013
Meet-cute is a term for the moment
in television and films,

16:11.096 --> 16:14.391
where the people who will go on
to form a romantic attachment

16:14.474 --> 16:15.726
meet for the first time.

16:19.229 --> 16:23.650
Anyway, I hope this is the start
of something beautiful.

16:23.734 --> 16:24.943
Shall we?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.331
The people are not happy!
The people are not--

16:51.345 --> 16:53.764
-You're in the same clothes.
-Been here all night.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.475
Chernitsky turned up in Upshott.
River planted his phone on him.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.312
-We're tracking his journey into London.
-Where's River? Is he all right?

17:00.395 --> 17:01.438
Don't know.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.568
-Chernitsky stopped in the city.
-Could have another target.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.529
You fancy a flutter on the method?

17:08.612 --> 17:12.699
So far we've had death by poisoning,
traffic accident and radiation.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.993
What do you reckon next? Sword?
Thumbs in the eyeballs?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.204
Roddy, this is serious.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.665
If we don't do something,
someone else is going to die.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.708
You need to go after him.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.086
He's a trained assassin. You go after him.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.797
-I have some unfinished business.
-No, you don't.

17:27.506 --> 17:28.882
Well, actually, Roddy, I do.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.927
Last night I met the man
who put the Russians in touch with Webb.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.596
He knows something, and he
was enjoying keeping it from me, so…

17:35.180 --> 17:37.808
I'm gonna wipe the smile
off his smug face.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.936
-Yeah, okay. Sure.
-Does Lamb know you did this?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.605
Yes. Well, no.

17:43.689 --> 17:44.982
And what did he say?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.775
Probably what you're about to say.
"Don't bother."

17:46.859 --> 17:50.362
What do you think you're gonna get?
Apart from Lamb's thumbs in your eyeballs.

17:50.445 --> 17:54.950
I don't know, but I think he can tell me
how Pashkin and Katinsky are connected.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.326
They're all in this together.

17:56.410 --> 17:59.121
And why has Slough House
been dragged into this? We're nobodies.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.748
Speak for yourself. I'm a somebody.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.126
Then get out of your chair
and do something.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.092
Come on, alpha dog.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.096
Time to let you off the leash
and follow the scent.

18:16.847 --> 18:17.848
Finally.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.684
Some respect from you.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.325
I know you're lying about Pashkin.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.786
Did you make Webb meet you here?

18:40.454 --> 18:43.957
He wouldn't have liked that.
Not his cup of tea at all.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.211
Not his idea to use Slough House either.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.046
That must have been requested.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.673
By whom? You?

18:52.674 --> 18:56.011
No, you only have opinions for money,
so Pashkin then?

18:58.138 --> 19:01.433
Surely even you must know
words cost lives.

19:01.934 --> 19:04.520
Well, I'm sure you could find a scapegoat

19:04.603 --> 19:07.147
to take the blame
for the leak of whatever you tell me.

19:07.856 --> 19:12.778
I mean, you've done it before.
Prague in '93. Zagreb in 2001.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.405
I mean, you always find someone
to pay for your mistakes.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.035
I didn't know you played.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.581
If I win,
you tell me the truth about Pashkin.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.625
Yes, and when I win,

19:26.708 --> 19:29.962
you will drink,
and we will toast my victory.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.637
I'm a gentleman. You play white.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.230
Everyone knows
the PM can't win the next election.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.149
It's only a matter of time before
he's shot in what's left of his balls

19:51.233 --> 19:53.986
and toddles off to be a third-tier pick
on the speaking circuit.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.530
And you will put yourself forward
for the leadership contest.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.575
Oh, no.
I'll be reluctantly prodded into it.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.703
I was at school with the PM, remember.
He's one of my oldest friends.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.831
And I'm very loyal to my friends.

20:09.543 --> 20:14.673
And what would you like me to do
to demonstrate our newfound friendship?

20:14.756 --> 20:19.428
You know how the party membership
loves security, defense and the like?

20:19.511 --> 20:22.264
I'd like you to put out the word,
off the record,

20:22.347 --> 20:26.476
that I am the only candidate you trust
to keep the nation safe.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.023
This is the bit where you say,
"And in return?"

20:31.899 --> 20:33.650
Why haven't you taken this to Tearney?

20:34.318 --> 20:37.196
Unfortunately,
First Desk has already expressed doubts

20:37.279 --> 20:40.240
about my being
a sufficiently serious character

20:40.324 --> 20:41.408
to lead the country.

20:41.491 --> 20:44.620
But then, I'm not sure if she's
a serious enough character to lead MI5.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.955
-But I am?
-Undoubtedly.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.583
So, do we have an understanding?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.794
Now you're making me wait.

20:52.878 --> 20:56.507
Nice. But I know you'll say yes.

20:57.758 --> 20:58.842
God.

20:59.426 --> 21:03.680
That sounds like a line that you use
on one of your pitiful little mistresses.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.196
Hey! Yeah, in here.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.156
Oh, my God.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.908
-What the bloody hell's going on?
-What the fuck?

21:22.991 --> 21:25.494
Thank God. Here, untie me.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.912
Where's Mum?

21:26.995 --> 21:29.373
-Told you, she took a plane.
-She doesn't fly.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.124
Well, there's a Cessna missing
from your runway.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.376
That's because she's on it.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.087
No. Wait. Untie me.
Untie me first. Come on.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.505
Who took the plane?

21:36.588 --> 21:37.756
I told you. She did.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.591
-But who tied you up?
-She did.

21:39.675 --> 21:42.010
-No, she didn't.
-What? You think I tied myself up?

21:42.094 --> 21:43.178
Run that by me.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.139
-Come on. Untie me now.
-Where's Leo?

21:46.223 --> 21:47.516
Look, it's a long story.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.726
I followed him here,
and then your mother turned up,

21:49.810 --> 21:51.270
and she Tasered me in the neck.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.022
-A Taser?
-Yeah. It really fucking hurt.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.274
Why would she have a Taser?

21:55.941 --> 21:57.693
Because she's a Russian sleeper agent.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.153
No, she fucking isn't!

22:00.237 --> 22:01.238
Have you met my mum?

22:01.321 --> 22:03.782
Yes, she is. I actually thought
it was you at first, Duncan.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.492
But I got that wrong.
It turns out it was her.

22:05.576 --> 22:07.452
And what-- Why would you think
I was a Russian agent?

22:07.536 --> 22:09.079
Wait, why would you think that she was?

22:09.162 --> 22:12.374
Oh, fuck. You were acting suspiciously,
really suspiciously.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.625
But your mother gave herself away

22:13.709 --> 22:15.669
when she turned up
and Tasered me in the neck.

22:15.752 --> 22:18.255
Look, you have to trust me, right?
I'm not a journalist.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.090
I'm an MI5 agent.

22:20.716 --> 22:21.717
Right, okay.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.553
I'm an MI5 agent,
and my name is River Cartwright.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.347
That's an even more stupid name
than Johnnie Walker!

22:27.431 --> 22:30.809
Jesus Christ. Look, Duncan,
you were suspicious of me

22:30.893 --> 22:32.895
because she was acting strange
just before I turned up.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.062
I'm right, am I right?

22:34.146 --> 22:35.898
Was she disappearing all the time?

22:35.981 --> 22:37.900
You know, taking phone calls
in the middle of the night?

22:37.983 --> 22:40.152
Just, you know,
generally acting a little bit strange?

22:41.653 --> 22:44.448
-She is not a Russian agent.
-She is a Russian agent.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.617
She's been reactivated,
and they've stuck her on a plane.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.827
-How come you've got her phone?
-Because she left it here.

22:48.911 --> 22:51.496
-Why would she leave her phone?
-Because she's not coming back.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.707
-For fuck's sake.
-Come on! Just untie me!

22:53.790 --> 22:55.209
It's her wedding ring.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.462
What the fuck's that doing here?

22:59.087 --> 23:00.714
Because she's not coming back.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.343
Please, just untie me.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.804
-I don't get this.
-What?

23:09.223 --> 23:14.311
"Duncan, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I love you. Alex."

23:16.480 --> 23:22.611
Okay. I'm gonna humor you.
What is she doing on that plane?

23:25.489 --> 23:27.115
She's gonna fly a bomb
into the Glasshouse.

23:27.199 --> 23:29.451
-Yeah. Of course, she is. Jesus Christ.
-You're full of bullshit.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.371
Look, I'm sorry. Look, I understand that
you're not going to get this right now.

23:32.454 --> 23:35.457
I un-- And it's a lot to take in.
But you have to believe me

23:35.541 --> 23:37.751
because hundreds,
maybe thousands of people,

23:37.835 --> 23:40.796
they're gonna die
unless you untie me right fucking now.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.551
Look, what if I'm right and you're wrong?

23:47.761 --> 23:49.638
How would I tie myself up?

23:59.481 --> 24:04.486
People, not profit!
People, not profit! People, not profit!

24:39.354 --> 24:41.565
Not a bad view, eh? It'll do.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.275
Yes.

24:43.358 --> 24:47.196
This is our haven, my friend. Our aerie.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.823
Come on.
Don't you feel like a fucking eagle?

24:57.497 --> 24:58.749
Anyway, shall we?

24:58.832 --> 24:59.917
Shall we what?

25:03.420 --> 25:05.255
Discuss how we put your boy
in the Kremlin.

25:08.467 --> 25:09.760
Sit down, Mr. Webb.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.396
So, to kickoff,

25:21.480 --> 25:26.818
I thought maybe I should state
HMG's official position on this meeting.

25:27.486 --> 25:30.739
I think first
we should discuss security for Mr. Nevsky.

25:31.406 --> 25:35.118
This meeting is a dry run for him
to step in here with Diana Taverner.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.913
And doing so will put him
at great potential risk.

25:37.996 --> 25:41.375
Dry run?
You're doing yourself down, Arkady.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.504
You and I,
we're the power behind the thrones.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.841
Our bosses meeting, it's a formality.

25:48.924 --> 25:51.718
We get to make the world anew.
They just initial the changes.

25:51.802 --> 25:55.347
Mr. Webb, if you're going to talk
this big, you need to get a better suit.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.810
That's good. You had me there.

25:59.893 --> 26:03.397
That's good. This is Cucinelli,
as I'm sure you're aware.

26:03.480 --> 26:07.234
I am. And I will give you
the details of a real tailor.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.654
Okay, that's good.
Well, I look forward to that.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.671
Yes. That's it. Come on.
Just pull the top bit down,

26:27.754 --> 26:30.757
and then the rest will come out.
That's it. Oh, fuck.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.765
-Go ahead.
-Cartwright, agent five, two, six, three.

26:38.849 --> 26:41.018
Access code,
Delta, Bravo, eight, two, seven.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.352
What do you report?

26:43.645 --> 26:44.938
Code September.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.024
Seeking authorization.

26:47.608 --> 26:48.942
Understood. Standing by.

26:49.985 --> 26:52.279
Alex, please respond.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.781
I don't want to believe you're doing
what I think you're doing.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.202
I love you. Please.

27:00.954 --> 27:01.955
Let me try.

27:05.834 --> 27:06.835
Mum.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.254
Mum, it's me.

27:10.339 --> 27:13.717
I don't care who you are
or what you do. Just--

27:15.761 --> 27:16.762
You're my mum.

27:18.222 --> 27:19.223
I know that's true.

27:21.183 --> 27:23.101
I love you. Please.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.980
Please don't do this. Please, Mum.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.778
She's cut us off. Fuck.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.040
People, not profit!

27:45.123 --> 27:46.124
Yes?

27:49.711 --> 27:51.129
What's the military assessment?

27:53.382 --> 27:54.508
Who called it in?

27:55.425 --> 27:56.426
Put him through.

27:57.302 --> 27:58.303
Ma'am.

27:59.054 --> 28:01.431
-You called a Code September?
-Yes, ma'am.

28:01.515 --> 28:04.685
Air traffic control affirmed
there are no commercial

28:04.768 --> 28:07.229
or military flights off course.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.898
Well, it's a small plane, ma'am.
But it's packed with explosives,

28:09.982 --> 28:11.692
and it's headed directly
for the Glasshouse.

28:12.276 --> 28:13.902
You are absolutely sure?

28:13.986 --> 28:16.029
I pull the cord on this
and there's no going back.

28:16.113 --> 28:18.282
-I'm sure, ma'am.
-You better be right.

28:25.664 --> 28:29.042
This is Second Desk. Give me 30 seconds,
then call a Code September.

28:37.593 --> 28:38.594
We have to leave now.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.012
Because of that lot?

28:40.095 --> 28:44.308
Not on your nelly.
I'm not scared of some smelly lefties.

28:44.391 --> 28:45.934
There has been an alert.

28:46.727 --> 28:49.563
Wha-- Well, one of those twats
has thrown a brick through the window.

28:49.646 --> 28:52.649
It's Code September.
We have to evacuate now.

28:52.733 --> 28:53.859
As in September the 11th?

28:54.902 --> 28:59.489
Chuck out Judd!
Chuck out Judd! Chuck out Judd!

29:00.657 --> 29:03.702
Do you mean some fucker's flying
a plane into one of these buildings?

29:03.785 --> 29:06.747
Not just a building. The Glasshouse.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.290
That's right above our heads!

29:24.556 --> 29:26.099
What are you waiting for? Drive.

29:28.227 --> 29:29.311
Thank you, Lee.

29:50.082 --> 29:51.667
"Code September."

29:52.251 --> 29:54.795
"Primary target, the Glasshouse Building."

29:54.878 --> 29:58.048
"Reported explosives. A Cess--"

29:58.924 --> 30:03.470
There's a fucking Cessna
with explosives on

30:03.554 --> 30:07.349
flying from the Cotswolds
to the Glasshouse.

30:07.432 --> 30:10.102
Don't you have agents
in both those locations?

30:10.185 --> 30:13.438
Yeah, I do. Christ.

30:16.608 --> 30:19.027
Fucking paperwork's gonna be a ball-ache.

30:28.579 --> 30:32.416
Check. I have this ready for you.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.758
Please stay calm. Keep moving.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.936
It's Marcus. Leave a message.

30:55.981 --> 30:58.609
Louisa
can't get to the phone right now.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.277
Please leave a message after the tone.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.529
Everyone's gone to fucking voice mail.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.702
You cannot win.

31:16.251 --> 31:19.463
Police are diverting marchers
away from the streets

31:19.546 --> 31:21.590
around the Glasshouse Building.

31:21.673 --> 31:26.220
But with no detail,
panic and speculation has set in.

31:26.303 --> 31:30.265
The entire London transport network,
now apparently shut down.

31:30.849 --> 31:34.019
The speed of this evacuation
will be hampered.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.274
Have you made the call?

31:39.942 --> 31:42.778
Yeah. Done. Yeah. Thank you.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.199
Is he okay?

31:47.866 --> 31:49.284
-No.
-Right.

31:51.328 --> 31:52.788
So, what happens next?

31:53.747 --> 31:56.708
Well, they'll evacuate all the buildings,
shut down the transport--

31:56.792 --> 31:58.168
No. I mean to my mum.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.212
Oh, right. Well, they'll

32:01.046 --> 32:03.090
scramble fighters
and try and talk her down.

32:04.591 --> 32:07.261
Right. And if they can't?

32:14.768 --> 32:15.769
Okay.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.447
Code September, what the fuck?

32:27.531 --> 32:29.324
That can't stop us finding Chernitsky.

32:29.408 --> 32:32.369
-He's been stationary for five minutes.
-Where?

32:35.831 --> 32:36.832
That car.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.760
This is a security announcement.

32:48.844 --> 32:50.637
Please evacuate the station.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.222
Phone must be in the coat.

32:52.723 --> 32:54.057
Well, we tried.

32:54.850 --> 32:57.853
-He's going to catch a train.
-We need to get out of the city!

32:57.936 --> 32:59.354
We need to find him!

33:15.162 --> 33:16.288
Check.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.834
Thank you for your queen.

33:24.463 --> 33:26.590
This reminds me of playing with my father.

33:26.673 --> 33:27.799
Did he always beat you?

33:28.300 --> 33:31.011
He hated losing,
so I always played two games.

33:31.094 --> 33:34.848
One on the board, where he won.
And one in my head, where I did.

33:35.974 --> 33:38.477
He was also quite open
about my chess-playing.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.522
Telling me where I was going wrong,
how I'd lost all my key pieces,

33:41.605 --> 33:43.565
that I was going to lose the game.

33:44.191 --> 33:45.442
Just like you.

33:46.151 --> 33:49.112
And just like you, he never knew
that I was secretly winning.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.490
Checkmate.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.409
The Immortal Game.

33:54.493 --> 33:58.997
Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky,
the 21st of June 1851.

33:59.706 --> 34:00.916
Here in London.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.752
Anderssen sacrificed both rooks,
a bishop and his queen,

34:03.836 --> 34:07.339
then checkmated Kieseritzky
with three minor pieces.

34:09.842 --> 34:11.260
I've always wanted to try that.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.969
And now you have.

34:14.221 --> 34:16.223
And now you tell me what I want to know.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.351
I don't.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.436
Yes, you do.

34:23.938 --> 34:27.359
-You're leaving me with no alternative.
-To what?

34:30.237 --> 34:31.237
I have your file.

34:32.114 --> 34:34.658
Maybe those who were
unexpectedly beaten or arrested

34:34.741 --> 34:35.868
because of your triple dealings

34:35.951 --> 34:38.745
would like to know
the part you played in their misery.

34:38.829 --> 34:42.708
You won't do that.
You don't have it in you.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.043
That's your gamble then, isn't it?

34:52.301 --> 34:53.217
What?

34:53.302 --> 34:55.721
Krymov met Katinsky, not Pashkin.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.931
He's been pulling
the strings the whole time.

34:58.015 --> 35:00.350
He's the one who made sure
Slough House was involved.

35:00.434 --> 35:01.977
Wha-- Why?

35:02.060 --> 35:04.313
He wants someone in Slough House,

35:04.938 --> 35:07.357
and the only someone there is you.

35:08.483 --> 35:09.943
Well, that makes no fucking sense.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.528
Are you drunk?

35:11.612 --> 35:14.364
Listen, you wanna make yourself useful,

35:14.448 --> 35:18.160
tell Marcus and Louisa
to get the fuck out of that building.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.584
Katinsky's intake.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.630
Who signed him in?

35:29.713 --> 35:31.089
Apparently, you did.

35:35.511 --> 35:36.887
You beast.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.848
Yeah, I know. It lingered.

35:44.102 --> 35:45.854
I never signed this.

35:45.938 --> 35:48.941
Are you sure?
You were drinking a fair bit back then.

35:49.816 --> 35:51.068
When have I not?

35:51.985 --> 35:54.863
Yeah, besides-- Yeah,
I was in Prague when this was signed.

35:54.947 --> 35:56.281
Can you prove that?

35:57.741 --> 36:00.077
No. It was off the books.

36:00.953 --> 36:03.789
The Yanks thought they had first dibs
on defectors.

36:03.872 --> 36:07.334
The Foreign Office ordered us
to hang back, but I went in anyway.

36:07.918 --> 36:09.169
How many people knew that?

36:09.253 --> 36:12.089
Well, enough to make it hard for me
to point the finger.

36:14.591 --> 36:18.595
Although one candidate does stand out.

36:21.223 --> 36:24.852
We had a traitor, Molly. Right at the top.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.146
I think he signed Katinsky in.

36:28.230 --> 36:30.023
And this traitor was running Katinsky--

36:30.107 --> 36:34.945
No. Katinsky was running our traitor.

36:36.405 --> 36:40.075
Katinsky mentioned cicadas at his debrief

36:40.158 --> 36:43.537
to make us think he was a nobody.

36:43.620 --> 36:47.291
And in one sense,
he's even less than a nobody.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.085
He's a ghost.

36:50.169 --> 36:55.215
Cicadas were meant to be a fiction,
dreamt up by a made-up spymaster.

36:55.299 --> 36:59.344
Nikolai Katinsky was that spymaster.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.805
Fuck me.

37:03.473 --> 37:07.144
And he's dying.
And he has unfinished business.

37:08.937 --> 37:10.772
Christ, Standish was right.

37:10.856 --> 37:12.107
What did she say?

37:14.193 --> 37:17.779
She said she knows what he wants.

37:20.908 --> 37:21.909
Me.

37:23.076 --> 37:25.120
This is a three-pronged campaign,

37:25.204 --> 37:27.831
online, internationally and in person.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.666
You run bots and influencers.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.669
We bend the ear of our allies,
and then Nevsky returns to Russia

37:32.753 --> 37:34.379
to campaign on the ground. Bingo.

37:35.255 --> 37:36.590
After his sweeping victory,

37:36.673 --> 37:39.343
you and I take a bow, as the king--
Oh, come on.

37:39.426 --> 37:41.595
Security alert.
Make your way to the nearest exit.

37:41.678 --> 37:43.889
I'm sure that's just a test.

37:43.972 --> 37:46.183
It's not a test. We'd know about it.

37:46.266 --> 37:50.229
It's an evacuation alarm.
We have to leave, Webb. Now.

37:51.688 --> 37:53.357
Oh, my fuck. Is this a joke?

37:53.440 --> 37:55.609
Sorry. We will set up
a new meeting shortly, I promise.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.528
A different location, a better location.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.238
Certainly a different security team.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.490
Can you please find out
why the fucking alarm

38:01.573 --> 38:03.784
-is going off and ruining--
-Stop talking, please.

38:04.451 --> 38:06.036
You two, sit.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.789
-What the fuck are--
-Sit down.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.958
-Arkady. Explanation, please.
-Hands on the table.

38:11.041 --> 38:15.003
-He's a fraud. Guessing FSB.
-You work for Nevsky.

38:16.213 --> 38:17.214
Nevsky's dead.

38:18.382 --> 38:19.925
What do you mean Nevsky's dead?

38:20.509 --> 38:22.177
These guys assassinated him.

38:22.803 --> 38:24.888
Make your way to the nearest exit.

38:28.225 --> 38:29.268
Piotr.

38:31.937 --> 38:33.939
Right, this makes absolutely no sense.

38:34.022 --> 38:35.065
Hands on the table.

38:38.652 --> 38:41.738
Security alert.
Make your way to the nearest exit.

38:42.239 --> 38:43.824
Okay, I'm sorry.
Can you just put that fucking--

38:43.907 --> 38:46.076
-Silence. Shut up.
-What the fuck is going on?

38:46.159 --> 38:47.536
Or I shoot you in the mouth.

38:52.082 --> 38:53.083
Sit down.

39:18.358 --> 39:19.902
No. Enough.

39:19.985 --> 39:23.697
-Yeah? You can't do this.
-Sit. Sit down. You stupid pig.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.449
I'm a representative
of Her Majesty's Government.

39:25.532 --> 39:28.577
No-- So, put that fucking popgun down now,
before I--

39:45.385 --> 39:46.553
Shit.
