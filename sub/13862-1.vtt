02:37.787 --> 02:39.656
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

02:39.689 --> 02:41.992
it is a great pleasure to be
here on this special day

02:42.025 --> 02:45.963
to celebrate the career of
a once-in-a-generation talent.

02:45.997 --> 02:51.602
Please help me welcome
my dear friend, Cooper Nielsen!

02:57.975 --> 02:59.043
Good to see you.

03:02.279 --> 03:04.715
On behalf of all of us here,

03:04.749 --> 03:06.650
thank you for all you've
done for dance.

03:06.683 --> 03:07.851
And thank you for all you've

03:07.885 --> 03:11.256
done for the American Ballet
Company.

03:11.289 --> 03:13.492
Thank you.

03:18.929 --> 03:20.598
Thank you to you all.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.165
Thank you, Jonathan.

03:22.199 --> 03:25.904
And thank you to the ABC for
that extraordinary performance.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.246
-So?
-That went well.

03:36.279 --> 03:37.748
You think?

03:37.781 --> 03:39.183
The company looked
great tonight.

03:39.215 --> 03:40.318
Well, thanks for all
your good work.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.718
Gentlemen.

03:41.751 --> 03:42.903
Beverly.

03:42.904 --> 03:44.054
Excuse me.

03:44.088 --> 03:45.406
Great show, Jonathan.

03:45.407 --> 03:46.724
Thank you.

03:46.756 --> 03:48.725
Listen, I'll get right to it.

03:48.759 --> 03:51.863
Your American Ballet Company
is out of money.

03:51.896 --> 03:54.898
Well, we're a ballet company.
We're always strapped for cash.

03:54.932 --> 03:57.902
There's a reason why the ballet
company has been

03:57.934 --> 04:00.304
in the red for the
last three quarters.

04:00.338 --> 04:01.940
I understand.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.542
I don't think you do.

04:05.775 --> 04:07.312
It was a beautiful show today,

04:07.344 --> 04:09.646
but there were empty seats.

04:09.679 --> 04:11.616
Cooper's shows fill them.

04:11.648 --> 04:13.951
Audiences, they want to see
different things these days.

04:13.985 --> 04:18.055
People who come to the ballet
want to see the ballet.

04:18.088 --> 04:21.692
Do you know how many hits one Misty
Copeland or Kate Parker video

04:21.725 --> 04:23.311
gets on YouTube every week?

04:23.312 --> 04:24.896
No.

04:24.929 --> 04:26.858
About the same amount
that ballet companies

04:26.859 --> 04:29.900
booked in tickets all last year.

04:29.934 --> 04:35.939
You need to evolve at long last,
or the ABC will be left behind.

04:35.973 --> 04:37.809
Look, Jonathan...

04:37.841 --> 04:41.111
yours is the only company yet to
incorporate contemporary ballet.

04:41.145 --> 04:43.681
Because we are
a classical ballet company.

04:43.713 --> 04:45.083
And you need to change that,

04:45.115 --> 04:47.884
and you need to figure out
what that change looks like.

04:47.917 --> 04:52.223
Give me a reason to invest
in your company again.

04:52.256 --> 04:53.925
Before it's too late.

05:20.150 --> 05:21.686
Jonathan.

05:21.718 --> 05:23.687
Hey, we're all looking for you.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.990
What's going on?

05:29.192 --> 05:30.894
We're broke.

05:30.927 --> 05:35.699
The company is about to close
our fourth quarter in the red.

05:35.732 --> 05:37.260
If we don't do
something different,

05:37.261 --> 05:41.071
there won't be the
American Ballet Company.

05:41.105 --> 05:42.739
Fourth quarter?

05:42.773 --> 05:44.308
The good news is,
we've been thrown a lifeline.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.177
What's the bad news?

05:47.211 --> 05:49.747
It's time for a change.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.416
Are you quitting?

05:51.449 --> 05:53.951
No. But it may be time
for the ABC

05:53.984 --> 05:57.722
to open its doors
to other forms of dance.

05:57.754 --> 06:00.023
Modern. More contemporary.

06:00.057 --> 06:02.794
This is the only strictly
classical company in the country.

06:02.826 --> 06:06.129
And the only strictly classical
companies in London,

06:06.162 --> 06:08.032
in Moscow, even in Paris

06:08.064 --> 06:12.170
integrated modern dance
into their repertoires ages ago.

06:12.203 --> 06:13.771
I've been a purist...

06:13.804 --> 06:17.275
but apparently that's a luxury
we can no longer afford.

06:17.307 --> 06:19.376
-I think that that's awesome.
-Good.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.246
The training camp program
is coming up.

06:22.278 --> 06:25.315
It's the perfect opportunity to
introduce modern to the company.

06:25.348 --> 06:27.250
Modern?

06:27.283 --> 06:30.420
Jonathan, you don't know the
first thing about modern dance.

06:30.453 --> 06:32.223
And for good reason.
It's beneath us.

06:32.256 --> 06:36.794
The ABC doesn't need
that less sophisticated genre.

06:36.826 --> 06:38.495
Well, that's going to change.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.364
This could be an exciting
opportunity for us.

06:41.398 --> 06:45.035
Let's start by adding some
new blood to the Studio Company.

06:45.069 --> 06:46.804
Tommy, you're best qualified
for that.

06:46.836 --> 06:49.840
Can you find us some
new talent with potential?

06:53.177 --> 06:56.748
Well, if it isn't Kate Parker.
How is it going? How's Sydney?

06:56.780 --> 06:58.449
<i>Busier than anyone
has the right to be.</i>

06:58.482 --> 06:59.784
<i>I got your text.</i>

06:59.816 --> 07:01.518
I know, isn't that amazing?

07:01.552 --> 07:04.222
I mean, ABC should've
been doing this years ago.

07:04.254 --> 07:05.822
<i>Of course you'd say that.</i>

07:05.855 --> 07:08.158
<i>Listen, Tommy, I've got one
word for you.</i>

07:08.191 --> 07:10.160
What's that?

07:10.194 --> 07:13.196
<i>Bella.</i>

07:13.230 --> 07:15.432
#...her before #

07:15.465 --> 07:18.299
# One pretty little trick tryna to
run out through the back door #

07:18.334 --> 07:19.069
# So I step to the left
puffed out the chest #

07:19.102 --> 07:20.972
# Kid so fly had to show
'em that ass #

07:21.004 --> 07:23.106
# That action, distraction #

07:23.139 --> 07:25.108
# Make this a chain reaction #

07:25.141 --> 07:27.177
# She was more than a ten
her and her friends #

07:27.211 --> 07:30.114
# Made their own money
and had their own ends #

07:30.146 --> 07:32.048
# Yow yip-yip yow#

07:32.081 --> 07:33.517
# Come here lemme show you
a pretty little face #

07:33.550 --> 07:35.452
# It's more than now,
dip-dip dow #

07:35.485 --> 07:37.888
# You stay here
and let you girl go #

07:37.922 --> 07:39.390
# I don't mean, mean no harm #

07:39.422 --> 07:41.292
# And I want to show you
the rude boy charm and #

07:41.324 --> 07:43.560
# Yep, give me the signal
and I'm on it #

07:43.593 --> 07:45.796
# That there body need warning,
warning #

07:45.829 --> 07:48.131
# You know that chick,
she's fine #

07:48.165 --> 07:52.136
# You know she's as bad
as she looks, she's mine #

07:52.169 --> 07:56.007
# She's all I want and I need,
no lie #

07:56.040 --> 07:58.009
# I ain't wastin' no time #

07:58.042 --> 08:00.044
# You see her going around
'cause she's a... #

08:00.076 --> 08:02.412
# Hold up! Wait a minute!
Minute, minute #

08:02.446 --> 08:05.349
# That chick, that chick right there,
that chick, that chick right there #

08:05.381 --> 08:07.985
# That girl # # That chick,
that chick right there #

08:08.018 --> 08:10.821
# That chick, that chick
right there # # That girl #

08:10.855 --> 08:14.425
# That chick, that chick right
there, that chick, that chick... #

08:14.458 --> 08:15.743
It's been a while.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.028
I know.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.330
You grew up.
When did you get so good?

08:19.362 --> 08:21.398
I practice every now and then.

08:21.432 --> 08:23.934
Not "now and then." Give yourself
some credit. That was fantastic.

08:23.968 --> 08:26.003
It's fun. It's not ballet,

08:26.035 --> 08:30.074
but I realized a while ago that
"The Glass Slipper" wasn't for me.

08:31.307 --> 08:32.943
How did you know I was here?

08:33.611 --> 08:36.047
Your sister.

08:36.078 --> 08:39.049
So, every year at the ABC,
there's this boot camp.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.318
It's part of the Academy,
it's how

08:40.351 --> 08:42.220
Jonathan feeds new dancers
into the program.

08:42.251 --> 08:44.454
This year, they're doing
something different.

08:44.487 --> 08:46.223
Jonathan's looking
for modern dancers,

08:46.256 --> 08:49.559
creative ones, who are
willing to move in any way.

08:49.593 --> 08:51.929
I think you should audition.

08:51.962 --> 08:54.298
Yeah, the company would
think about me?

08:54.330 --> 08:55.332
Yeah.

08:55.366 --> 08:57.068
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

08:57.101 --> 08:59.604
Kate didn't get in, and she's
a way better dancer than I am.

08:59.636 --> 09:03.940
Well, like I said, Jonathan's not just
looking for classical ballet dancers.

09:03.973 --> 09:08.045
He wants modern. All right?
A new vibe, a whole new thing.

09:08.078 --> 09:11.015
I think that
you'd be great for it.

09:11.048 --> 09:12.250
I don't think so.

09:12.282 --> 09:15.385
Yeah, Wednesday, 3:00.
Here's the address.

09:15.419 --> 09:18.622
All you need to do is just come
up with a little modern routine.

09:18.655 --> 09:21.324
Just show off what you can do.

09:21.357 --> 09:25.396
I don't think I'd be comfortable
there. In that environment.

09:26.296 --> 09:28.031
In what environment?

09:28.064 --> 09:31.468
Well, it's a world-class
ballet company.

09:31.501 --> 09:37.507
It's full of all these gorgeous,
beautiful, skinny ballerinas, and...

09:37.540 --> 09:39.242
No. No, none of that matters.

09:39.275 --> 09:43.113
When they see you dance?
It's fantastic.

09:43.146 --> 09:44.915
You're gonna be fine, trust me.

09:44.949 --> 09:48.319
Even if I went, I would have to
change my name on that application.

09:48.352 --> 09:51.188
I don't want people to know
that I'm Kate Parker's sister.

09:51.221 --> 09:53.658
That's fine. You can
call yourself whatever you want.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.325
Is that a yes?

09:55.358 --> 09:56.526
That's a maybe.

09:56.559 --> 09:59.930
No. Wednesday, 3:00?
I'll see you there?

10:22.519 --> 10:24.388
What's with the moves?

10:24.420 --> 10:27.391
I'm auditioning to be part of
the American Ballet Company.

10:27.424 --> 10:29.193
A ballerina?

10:29.226 --> 10:32.330
So dancing runs in the family?

10:33.530 --> 10:35.300
You're not the ballet type.

10:36.666 --> 10:38.735
I'm not auditioning to
be a ballerina.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.172
I'm auditioning
to be a modern dancer.

10:41.204 --> 10:44.341
Auditioning? Well, just tell
them who you are.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.644
I can't tell them I'm
Kate Parker's sister, because

10:46.676 --> 10:51.181
then they'll expect me to dance like
her, and I already know I can't.

10:51.214 --> 10:53.416
Anyways, I want to get
in on my own.

10:53.449 --> 10:55.051
You'd be a good paralegal.

10:55.084 --> 10:58.088
I don't want to be a paralegal.
I want to be a dancer.

10:58.122 --> 11:00.458
Yeah, well, so did that one.

11:00.491 --> 11:06.230
I had the same conversation with her
20 years ago, right in this chair.

11:07.097 --> 11:09.333
I'm still here.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.535
So is she.

11:11.568 --> 11:13.203
Eat your pie, Myron.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.706
I'm just trying to give
you a little dose of reality.

11:15.738 --> 11:18.008
Following your dreams is
one thing

11:18.041 --> 11:21.545
but it's good to have a
backup plan.

11:21.578 --> 11:24.982
I don't want to be talking
to you here in 20 years.

11:27.117 --> 11:29.187
Thank you, Myron.

11:55.179 --> 11:59.317
Hey! Hey!

12:47.598 --> 12:49.232
<i>So what's next for you, Kate?</i>

12:49.266 --> 12:50.867
<i>I'm going to Rome next week.</i>

12:50.900 --> 12:52.770
<i>I wanna go too,
but I have school.</i>

12:52.803 --> 12:55.239
<i>Maybe one day you'll get to dance
onstage with your big sister.</i>

12:55.271 --> 12:57.507
<i>I already practice every day.</i>

14:15.218 --> 14:16.719
Honestly?

14:16.752 --> 14:20.491
I'm feeling pretty good
about my chances this year.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.761
Richard Nooney.

14:23.794 --> 14:25.529
Great dancer.

14:25.561 --> 14:27.530
Never should have
switched to modern though.

14:27.564 --> 14:30.535
His girlfriend's a dancer, too,
but I hear she's better.

14:31.702 --> 14:32.970
That's Allegra Hjelmstad.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.338
She's amazing.
I already know she's in.

14:35.372 --> 14:38.208
Unless they find out
about her reputation.

14:38.242 --> 14:40.376
But everyone pretty much
knows already, so...

14:40.410 --> 14:42.612
What's her reputation?

14:42.646 --> 14:45.381
Sabotage.

14:45.415 --> 14:48.751
She was forced out of the
Dallas Ballet Academy for it.

14:48.785 --> 14:51.521
But her dad's uber-rich,
so they kept it on the down low.

14:51.554 --> 14:55.425
She's who you want for a partner,
but she's mine, so hands off.

14:57.261 --> 14:58.761
What about her?

14:58.795 --> 15:01.565
Her? Seriously?

15:03.733 --> 15:07.338
That's the level
these modern dancers are on.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.815
Looks like you found
some talented movers.

15:18.848 --> 15:21.718
Nice job.

15:21.751 --> 15:24.454
I'd like to thank you all
for auditioning.

15:24.487 --> 15:27.023
You've all presented your arts
and skills admirably

15:27.056 --> 15:30.660
both in ballet
and in modern dance.

15:30.694 --> 15:33.997
Those of you who made the short
list for the next round,

15:34.030 --> 15:36.000
let's take five.

15:36.032 --> 15:38.635
Drink some water,
stretch it out...

15:38.669 --> 15:41.538
then we'll get started.

15:41.570 --> 15:45.008
Jonathan, these moderns aren't going
to catch up on ballet at camp.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.776
They're years behind.

15:46.809 --> 15:48.679
You never know. They all
have at least some training.

15:48.712 --> 15:50.780
Well, some training isn't good
enough, Jonathan.

15:50.814 --> 15:55.052
If this is really what you want to
do, the ballet dancers will suffice.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.336
If they can loosen up.

15:56.337 --> 15:57.588
They don't need to loosen up.

15:57.621 --> 15:59.357
Let's begin.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.596
My goodness.

17:06.423 --> 17:08.692
What's your name?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.026
Bella.

17:10.059 --> 17:11.796
Bella Miller.

17:19.703 --> 17:21.472
Sorry.

17:26.842 --> 17:29.813
Found it. I'm ready.

18:07.184 --> 18:11.521
She's wrong in every way, and
I can't take my eyes off her.

18:11.555 --> 18:12.673
What?

18:12.674 --> 18:13.791
There's something there.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.103
She'll never do pointe.

18:26.136 --> 18:27.503
If she has a good enough ballet
teacher, she'll be alright.

18:27.537 --> 18:28.806
I beg your pardon?

18:43.252 --> 18:47.791
Okay, so what about
another modern?

18:51.528 --> 18:52.930
She's young.

18:52.963 --> 18:55.232
Yeah, but she's good.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.833
I like her.

18:59.502 --> 19:01.672
Let's take a chance on her.

19:01.704 --> 19:04.809
Only one modern spot left.

19:06.809 --> 19:09.679
Well, there's no contest.
We can't possibly accept Bella.

19:09.713 --> 19:13.116
I mean, she's clearly not somebody
with potential or talent.

19:13.148 --> 19:14.784
Nope. My vote is for the blonde.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.819
Bella.

19:16.853 --> 19:20.657
I gotta say, Bella's an
unconventional choice.

19:20.690 --> 19:24.761
But she has something
worth exploring.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.498
And my vote.

19:39.209 --> 19:41.645
Yo, the list is up!

19:41.677 --> 19:43.012
The list is up!

20:17.580 --> 20:19.082
Hello, Bella Parker.

20:20.783 --> 20:22.919
I made a mistake
not accepting your sister,

20:22.953 --> 20:25.088
but I not gonna make
the same mistake with you.

20:26.790 --> 20:30.626
I just didn't want anyone
knowing Kate was my sister.

20:30.659 --> 20:32.562
I understand.

20:33.195 --> 20:35.031
It's nice to see you again.

20:35.065 --> 20:38.569
And Miss Miller, get yourself
a new pair of tights.

20:39.301 --> 20:40.838
Yes, sir.

20:42.973 --> 20:45.709
We did it! We did it!

20:58.221 --> 21:00.824
Congratulations.

21:00.857 --> 21:04.595
And welcome to American Ballet
Company's training camp intensive.

21:04.627 --> 21:06.797
We are looking
to expand our repertoire

21:06.829 --> 21:10.133
and include
more modern influences

21:10.165 --> 21:11.801
and create something new.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.606
Only a select few of you
will make it into the company.

21:15.638 --> 21:17.940
It's our version of
the junior varsity team.

21:17.973 --> 21:21.877
You will be required to work
on ballet technique and modern

21:21.911 --> 21:24.081
if you expect to get
any further.

21:24.114 --> 21:25.649
Charlie?

21:25.682 --> 21:27.384
Thank you, Jonathan.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.087
The bus leaves 8:00 a.m.
Friday morning.

21:30.119 --> 21:32.121
Look around you.

21:32.155 --> 21:35.224
This is your competition, and also
your family, for the next six weeks.

21:35.258 --> 21:37.294
What if you've got
no competition?

21:37.327 --> 21:41.164
What if you let us
make that judgment?

21:41.196 --> 21:45.267
And one more thing. This is
a world-class institution.

21:46.299 --> 21:47.037
Dress the part.

22:22.071 --> 22:24.174
Gwen back there?

22:24.206 --> 22:26.142
She's phenomenal.

22:26.175 --> 22:27.410
She looks like she's 15.

22:27.444 --> 22:30.414
That's 'cause she is.

22:30.446 --> 22:33.416
Candie over there?
She shouldn't be a problem.

22:33.450 --> 22:36.153
She's good,
but she's a total follower.

22:36.185 --> 22:39.388
So you just know everything there
is to know about everyone, then?

22:39.422 --> 22:41.223
Best way to get ahead.

22:41.257 --> 22:44.126
So what's my story then?

22:44.159 --> 22:45.428
What's that saying?

22:45.462 --> 22:49.398
"A good artist copies,
a great artist steals?"

22:49.432 --> 22:52.102
You're a good dancer. Good.

22:54.203 --> 22:55.338
And what's your deal?

22:55.370 --> 22:59.842
Me? I'm a great dancer.

22:59.876 --> 23:02.245
They'll call me
the next Cooper Nielsen.

23:04.848 --> 23:06.348
Hey, where's that girl
with the hole in her tights?

23:06.382 --> 23:08.952
Who cares?

23:13.255 --> 23:15.024
No!

23:15.058 --> 23:16.727
No, no! Wait!

23:16.760 --> 23:19.963
Hey, wait! Hey!

23:23.366 --> 23:25.367
Thank you.

23:25.401 --> 23:28.105
Sorry I'm late.

23:29.204 --> 23:31.908
Show up anytime.

23:40.550 --> 23:43.020
Hi. Thanks.

25:30.926 --> 25:32.862
The studio!

25:34.297 --> 25:35.933
This is so much fun!

25:48.043 --> 25:51.046
Everybody take a sheet.

25:51.079 --> 25:54.416
A map of the campground and
cabin assignments are listed.

25:54.450 --> 25:58.989
You have 30 minutes to settle
in, then we meet in the lounge.

26:03.626 --> 26:05.127
Dismissed.

26:40.296 --> 26:43.232
Unbelievable. There's no Wi-Fi,
barely any cell signal.

26:43.265 --> 26:45.701
Hope we don't
have to share bathrooms.

26:45.734 --> 26:50.006
It's just six weeks.
Just six weeks.

26:51.406 --> 26:54.444
What are you doing?
Do you hear that?

26:55.677 --> 26:57.481
Silence.

26:59.014 --> 27:01.484
I've never heard that before.

27:16.098 --> 27:18.635
Bella! We're bunk-buddies.
Bunk-buddies!

27:18.667 --> 27:19.985
It's cute, right?

27:19.986 --> 27:21.303
Yeah.

27:21.337 --> 27:23.173
I like what you did with
the place.

27:23.205 --> 27:23.906
Thanks.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.008
My god, can I have top bunk?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.059
Yeah.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.077
Okay.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.311
Yes!

27:29.345 --> 27:30.747
Come on, we gotta
go for roll call!

27:30.780 --> 27:33.116
Okay.

27:33.148 --> 27:34.984
Yes! Bunk buddies!

27:35.018 --> 27:37.354
Coming! I'm coming!

27:37.386 --> 27:40.456
I expect you all to dress
properly in my ballet class.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.059
Ladies, pink tights and black
leotard.

27:43.091 --> 27:46.061
Gentlemen, white shirts
and black tights.

27:46.095 --> 27:47.764
-No exception.
-Except for in my class,

27:47.797 --> 27:50.666
I don't care what you wear, as
long as you can dance in it. Okay?

27:50.700 --> 27:54.337
Also, Jonathan highly recommends
you guys work together.

27:54.369 --> 27:56.539
In fact, your performance
depends on it.

27:56.571 --> 27:59.108
This year you guys are going
to be judged in pairs.

27:59.142 --> 28:03.513
I know it's not a typical situation,
but this isn't a typical season.

28:03.546 --> 28:06.282
Now, all the studios
will be open during the evening

28:06.315 --> 28:08.618
for you to practice and perfect
everything that you've learned.

28:08.651 --> 28:12.555
I highly encourage you
to take full advantage of that.

28:12.588 --> 28:15.224
Lights out 10:30. That's it.

28:21.329 --> 28:26.302
<i># Hey, hey... #</i>

28:27.502 --> 28:29.473
<i># Hey, hey... #</i>

28:37.346 --> 28:39.782
<i># Feel the pitch-black
sky above #</i>

28:39.816 --> 28:42.251
<i># Don't be scared to
give it love #</i>

28:42.284 --> 28:47.122
<i># There's a full moon on
the rise tonight #</i>

28:47.155 --> 28:49.358
<i># Crazy eights too hard
to find #</i>

28:49.392 --> 28:51.661
<i># So let's get stupid
Out of line #</i>

28:51.694 --> 28:56.532
<i># Drive this body off the
cliff, all right #</i>

28:56.566 --> 28:58.535
<i># Everyone everywhere #</i>

28:58.568 --> 29:01.304
<i># You got to get out
your chair #</i>

29:01.337 --> 29:03.673
<i># This is a love affair #</i>

29:03.705 --> 29:06.542
<i># With everyone everywhere #</i>

29:06.576 --> 29:08.611
<i># Everywhere everyone #</i>

29:08.644 --> 29:11.247
<i># The party has just begun #</i>

29:11.280 --> 29:13.616
<i># Don't matter
where you've been #</i>

29:13.648 --> 29:15.784
<i># Everybody everywhere #</i>

29:15.818 --> 29:18.687
<i># Everyone come on #</i>

29:18.721 --> 29:20.824
<i># Everyone everywhere #</i>

29:20.857 --> 29:23.358
<i># You got to get out
your share #</i>

29:23.392 --> 29:26.129
<i># 'Cause this is a
love affair #</i>

29:26.162 --> 29:28.598
<i># With everyone everywhere #</i>

29:28.630 --> 29:30.732
<i># Everywhere everyone #</i>

29:30.765 --> 29:33.268
<i># The party has just begun #</i>

29:33.301 --> 29:35.704
<i># Doesn't matter
where you're from #</i>

29:35.738 --> 29:38.174
<i># Everybody everywhere #</i>

29:38.206 --> 29:41.276
<i># Everyone, come on #</i>

29:41.309 --> 29:42.712
How are we supposed
to beat those guys?

29:42.744 --> 29:44.546
Seriously?

29:44.579 --> 29:46.715
They've all been training
since they were, like, three.

29:46.749 --> 29:50.153
So we have to figure out ballet. They
all have to learn how to do modern.

29:50.185 --> 29:53.689
And Charlie says that we're getting
judged on our personalities

29:53.723 --> 29:55.492
as equally as our abilities.

29:55.524 --> 29:58.527
So you mean I should
just smile a lot?

29:58.560 --> 30:01.798
I'm saying that we should just
dance the way we know we can

30:01.830 --> 30:04.800
and try and get along
with everyone.

30:04.834 --> 30:06.403
Good luck with that.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.737
-Hey!
-See?

30:08.771 --> 30:11.540
They're either insulting us
or pretending we don't exist.

30:18.647 --> 30:20.750
Where are you going?

30:20.782 --> 30:23.652
To show them I exist.

30:33.195 --> 30:35.232
Are you excited for class?

30:42.271 --> 30:45.142
How long have
you been doing ballet for?

30:47.976 --> 30:51.613
Since I was three.

30:51.646 --> 30:53.516
Ballet is cool.

31:13.301 --> 31:18.540
Lift the tail, drop the heels
and hold for one...

31:18.573 --> 31:21.777
Are you from New York?
two...

31:21.810 --> 31:23.612
Have you ever been to the
Apthorp?

31:23.646 --> 31:25.682
Sorry, I don't know where that
is.

31:25.714 --> 31:28.217
Now, left leg comes up.

31:29.452 --> 31:32.789
Her parents have an apartment
in that building.

31:32.821 --> 31:34.407
Whose?

31:34.408 --> 31:35.992
Vanessa. My girlfriend?

31:36.024 --> 31:38.293
We're moving in.
We can't wait to live together.

31:38.327 --> 31:40.296
Bring the leg through...

31:40.328 --> 31:44.434
and proceed into
side angle pose.

31:47.302 --> 31:49.371
You're facing the wrong way.

31:49.405 --> 31:51.607
Deviation is the essence
of modern dance.

31:53.276 --> 31:55.745
Also, I sometimes get
my right and my left mixed up.

31:55.778 --> 32:00.349
Low lunge, back to low lunge.

32:02.784 --> 32:05.654
Cactus arms, everyone.

32:05.687 --> 32:07.322
Find your claws.

32:07.356 --> 32:09.925
Find your inner animal.

32:09.959 --> 32:12.562
You are the calm in the
center...

32:12.595 --> 32:16.031
of the storm and chaos
around you.

32:16.065 --> 32:18.968
We're gonna scream that
storm away!

32:24.005 --> 32:25.807
Come on, come on.

32:35.384 --> 32:37.353
I have the list of pairs.

32:37.386 --> 32:40.423
Candie, you're with Ivan.
Gwen, with Michael.

32:40.455 --> 32:41.874
Allegra, you're with Richard.

32:41.875 --> 32:43.292
Yes.

32:43.326 --> 32:46.362
Lauren, you're with Sam.
Megan, with Patrick.

32:46.395 --> 32:49.566
And Damon, you've got Bella.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.837
Find your partners.

32:55.538 --> 32:57.040
Sorry, dude.

32:57.072 --> 32:58.191
Hey.

32:58.192 --> 32:59.309
Hey.

32:59.341 --> 33:00.843
-So it'll be good.
-Yeah.

33:08.751 --> 33:09.853
And...

33:13.856 --> 33:15.659
You'll do.

33:16.692 --> 33:18.694
Yes, yes, yes, good.

33:18.728 --> 33:21.731
Okay, guys. I need you to focus
on moving your entire body.

33:21.763 --> 33:24.833
I need you to breathe,
I need you to feel.

33:24.867 --> 33:26.903
Like this tree
when the wind blows through it.

33:26.935 --> 33:30.807
It all moves in unison. It's
connected, it's breathing, it's alive.

33:30.839 --> 33:33.842
Good. That's what we're doing
here, we're breathing.

33:33.876 --> 33:37.480
I want you to move any way
your body wants to move.

33:37.512 --> 33:39.381
Let's try some improv.

33:39.415 --> 33:41.684
Gwen, start us off.

33:46.989 --> 33:48.692
Good.

34:00.502 --> 34:02.972
Yes, Gwen, thank you. Yes.

34:03.004 --> 34:05.474
That's exactly what I'm talking
about.

34:05.508 --> 34:07.143
Damon, give it a go.
No...

34:07.175 --> 34:11.112
Don't be afraid of it. Come on,
buddy, you got it. Let's go. Try.

34:11.147 --> 34:12.614
Improv, you got this.

34:15.684 --> 34:17.018
Okay.

34:17.051 --> 34:20.021
It's all good, buddy. Let's all
move. Everyone together, breathe.

34:20.054 --> 34:21.690
Don't sweat it.

34:21.723 --> 34:24.393
Damon, give it a go, buddy.
No one cares what you're doing.

34:28.964 --> 34:30.500
Got it?

34:30.864 --> 34:33.001
Nice!

34:33.034 --> 34:35.672
Awesome. Keep moving.
Keep moving!

34:40.507 --> 34:43.713
Don't worry about
what anyone else is thinking.

34:43.745 --> 34:45.614
Let's take a piqué arabesque.

34:45.647 --> 34:48.449
Gentleman, I'm always aware
of where her weight is.

34:48.484 --> 34:51.187
Her hips are
right over her ankle.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.589
You take one hand off,
no problem.

34:57.593 --> 34:59.863
Ladies, use your pliés.

35:01.062 --> 35:03.932
Strong core.

35:03.966 --> 35:06.603
Standing leg straight.

35:07.068 --> 35:08.737
That's okay.

35:10.705 --> 35:12.058
You all right?

35:12.059 --> 35:13.410
Off the floor.

35:15.211 --> 35:17.330
I'm sorry.

35:17.331 --> 35:19.448
Seven, eight...

35:20.950 --> 35:23.185
Not bad.

35:23.218 --> 35:25.588
Remember guys,
it's not how strong you are.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.956
It's about how well
you work together in the lift.

35:55.216 --> 35:57.220
Trying to get rid of me?

35:57.252 --> 35:59.588
What? No, of course not.

35:59.622 --> 36:02.658
She speaks.

36:02.691 --> 36:05.828
I didn't say anything about you.

36:05.861 --> 36:10.566
I know. I'm just teasing you.

36:10.598 --> 36:15.838
Well, I just want to make sure you
know that I'm not like that, okay?

36:15.870 --> 36:18.540
I think we're gonna be
really great partners, actually.

36:18.573 --> 36:20.542
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:20.575 --> 36:24.513
I do too, because I'm just telling
you, everything's working out for me.

36:24.546 --> 36:28.251
Vanessa.
I'm here. You're my partner.

36:28.283 --> 36:30.720
Don't worry, we got this.

36:30.752 --> 36:32.622
Do you want to practice
tonight?

36:32.655 --> 36:34.189
I don't know what else
I'd be doing.

36:34.222 --> 36:36.591
Okay, fair, yeah.

36:36.624 --> 36:38.927
<i>Seven, eight.</i>

36:38.961 --> 36:42.832
Plié, one, two...

36:42.865 --> 36:46.167
three, four...

36:46.200 --> 36:49.004
five, six...

36:49.037 --> 36:51.006
seven, eight.

36:51.039 --> 36:54.943
And a one, two...

36:54.977 --> 36:58.080
three, four...

36:59.714 --> 37:02.984
Should my arm be further back
for that part?

37:03.017 --> 37:04.886
What are you wearing?

37:04.919 --> 37:08.890
I specifically said that each student
should wear the proper uniform.

37:08.923 --> 37:11.093
Well, this is all I have
that's black.

37:13.194 --> 37:14.731
It's Bella, right?

37:19.301 --> 37:21.636
Seven, eight...

37:21.669 --> 37:26.341
And a one, two, three...

37:26.374 --> 37:30.847
And three, four, up. Good.

37:33.115 --> 37:36.852
Lorenza is such an asshole.

37:38.019 --> 37:40.923
Don't let her freak you out.
She's just bitter.

37:42.357 --> 37:45.827
Bitter about what?

37:45.861 --> 37:48.864
<i>She used to be a principal
dancer at La Scala in Milan</i>

37:48.897 --> 37:52.034
but then she suffered
a serious injury.

37:52.066 --> 37:54.202
She was awesome.

37:54.236 --> 37:58.074
Which is tragic, really, but she
shouldn't be taking that out on us.

37:58.106 --> 38:00.809
Maybe if the bunch of you
could actually dance.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.011
I'll show you dancing,
ballerina boy.

39:03.138 --> 39:07.977
Some people might say that
modern dance has no place here.

39:08.010 --> 39:10.046
That it's a second tier
form of dance.

39:10.078 --> 39:13.749
That it lacks substance,
that it lacks rules.

39:13.781 --> 39:16.285
Modern is
just as demanding as ballet.

39:16.318 --> 39:19.120
It is just a different mind-set,
a different technique.

39:19.153 --> 39:22.190
It comes from your gut,
from your hips, from your torso.

39:22.223 --> 39:25.394
It's not about being vertical,
it's about being grounded,

39:25.426 --> 39:28.863
so you can shape
your body to the music.

39:28.897 --> 39:30.366
You just want us
to roll around on the floor?

39:30.399 --> 39:32.234
No, I want you
to train your body

39:32.267 --> 39:34.102
so you get off the floor
without using your hands.

39:34.135 --> 39:37.372
That's it, Bella, good work.
Keep going. Keep moving.

39:37.406 --> 39:39.075
Good.

39:43.345 --> 39:45.013
It's a fight!

39:47.982 --> 39:49.051
Hey, guys!

39:49.084 --> 39:50.453
Get off me!

39:50.486 --> 39:51.420
Get off me!
Think you can take me?

39:51.452 --> 39:52.787
Stop it!

39:52.821 --> 39:54.190
Let him go!
I'll kick his ass.

39:54.222 --> 39:56.324
Yo, fight's over! All right?

39:56.357 --> 39:59.062
Just go.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.100
Do you want them to send
you home?

40:05.133 --> 40:06.234
I'm sick of that guy.

40:06.267 --> 40:07.970
He's messing with your head.

40:08.002 --> 40:09.939
That's how he's gonna take
you out of this competition.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.941
We're just
a bunch of amateurs to them.

40:11.973 --> 40:14.276
So we need to work twice as hard
and be twice as professional

40:14.309 --> 40:17.714
to prove them wrong.

41:48.437 --> 41:50.106
No.

41:57.312 --> 41:59.181
Seven, eight.

41:59.214 --> 42:02.251
And a one, two...

42:02.283 --> 42:05.453
three, four, five...

42:05.486 --> 42:06.454
Dammit.

42:06.488 --> 42:09.491
six, seven, eight.

42:09.524 --> 42:12.962
And a one, two...

42:13.361 --> 42:15.630
three, four...

42:15.664 --> 42:17.366
five, six
Hey.

42:17.399 --> 42:20.435
<i>I was wondering if we could
do the pas de dux?</i>

42:20.468 --> 42:22.403
<i>I'm sorry, the pas de what?</i>

42:22.437 --> 42:24.205
<i>The pas de dux?</i>

42:24.238 --> 42:27.175
It's "pas de deux."

42:28.577 --> 42:30.613
Back to the barre, please.

42:30.646 --> 42:33.481
Yeah.

42:33.515 --> 42:36.886
Six, seven, eight.

42:36.919 --> 42:40.957
And a one, two, three...

42:46.294 --> 42:48.497
And a one, two...

42:48.530 --> 42:52.100
three, four, five...

42:52.133 --> 42:55.069
No, Ivan, you're showing off!

42:55.102 --> 42:57.205
You're not ready for that jump.

42:57.238 --> 42:59.908
You've got the right technique,
but don't dance with your heart.

42:59.941 --> 43:01.243
Richard, you're up.

43:02.678 --> 43:05.882
Ivan, stop it.

43:08.082 --> 43:10.986
Ivan, get off the floor!

43:14.323 --> 43:16.258
Quit it, man.
You're gonna get kicked out.

43:16.290 --> 43:19.327
Don't kid yourself. You are not
good enough to make that jump.

43:22.430 --> 43:24.367
Ivan, stop it!

43:30.738 --> 43:33.408
It's broken.

43:33.441 --> 43:35.144
Get Dr. Larum.

43:36.178 --> 43:39.482
You may have a very long
recovery ahead of you.

43:41.482 --> 43:43.285
I told you to stop.

43:43.318 --> 43:45.653
You think you know better
than I?

43:45.687 --> 43:48.257
I know what you should be doing,
when you should be doing it,

43:48.289 --> 43:50.024
and how you should be doing it.

43:50.057 --> 43:53.161
Now, if I say you're not ready,
you are not ready.

43:53.194 --> 43:57.466
And if I say you're not good
enough, you are not good enough!

44:00.435 --> 44:02.071
Class dismissed.

44:08.577 --> 44:10.245
Bella!

44:10.678 --> 44:12.347
Bella, wait up.

44:12.381 --> 44:15.051
Hey, I didn't get a chance to
thank you this morning for

44:15.052 --> 44:17.720
letting me into Lorenza's class.

44:17.752 --> 44:20.323
Yeah, sure.

44:21.756 --> 44:24.159
Hey, come on.

44:26.761 --> 44:29.731
I can't do this.

44:29.765 --> 44:32.001
Do what?

44:32.033 --> 44:34.502
Well, everything Lorenza
just said in there.

44:36.638 --> 44:39.174
I'm not good enough.

44:39.207 --> 44:40.709
I was never good enough.

44:40.742 --> 44:44.646
Bella, don't even say that.

44:44.678 --> 44:47.515
They want the next Kate Parker.

44:51.553 --> 44:54.490
You're her sister, aren't you?

44:54.522 --> 44:59.361
I've seen you before with her.
When you were younger.

44:59.394 --> 45:01.196
On the Internet.

45:07.169 --> 45:10.539
Yeah, I am. I'm her sister.

45:11.705 --> 45:13.374
Please don't tell anyone, okay?

45:13.408 --> 45:16.011
Of course not.

46:09.865 --> 46:12.834
Hey, it's me, I just...

46:12.868 --> 46:14.336
What are you doing?

46:14.368 --> 46:17.138
Do you really want to leave?

46:17.171 --> 46:19.173
I'm not going to be a dancer...

46:19.207 --> 46:22.377
so I might as well
go back to be a waitress.

46:22.410 --> 46:24.613
I'm done.

46:24.646 --> 46:27.115
You're an amazing dancer.

46:33.655 --> 46:37.725
You're the perfect ballerina.

46:37.758 --> 46:41.129
Look, I came here for a reason.

46:42.531 --> 46:44.633
What's that?

46:44.665 --> 46:48.403
Just put the big one between
your big toe and second toe

46:48.435 --> 46:51.640
and the small piece in between
your fourth and fifth toes.

47:11.392 --> 47:16.264
Well. That's so much better.
Thank you.

47:21.368 --> 47:24.506
Okay, let's go have some fun.

47:40.555 --> 47:44.593
# Growing old
is something in the moment #

47:44.626 --> 47:48.629
# Let's go to places we've
never been before #

47:48.662 --> 47:53.801
# Feels right
to live out loud tonight #

48:11.852 --> 48:12.820
Come on.

48:12.854 --> 48:15.191
No.

48:35.510 --> 48:38.479
Okay. Do that again,
but extend your arm up more

48:38.513 --> 48:40.515
and extend your front leg.

48:40.548 --> 48:41.750
-Okay.
-Okay.

48:48.022 --> 48:51.425
That was so good.

48:51.459 --> 48:53.028
You need to help us.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.698
Look, you're the best ballerina
here, and I'm a good modern dancer,

48:56.731 --> 49:02.303
so if we helped each other out,
we could get in together.

49:02.336 --> 49:05.339
Well, I guess I could use some
help in Tommy's class.

49:05.372 --> 49:07.008
You and me both.

49:07.042 --> 49:12.014
Okay, so let's meet up in the
evenings, work on our weak points?

49:12.046 --> 49:15.316
All four of us.
Let's do it. Yeah.

49:15.350 --> 49:18.654
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

49:26.060 --> 49:29.030
We never would've got into the
company if that was our audition.

49:29.064 --> 49:32.868
Company or no company, all I've
ever wanted to do is dance.

49:32.901 --> 49:36.605
Well then, you should probably perfect
your ballet technique a little more.

49:36.638 --> 49:38.507
I mean, Lorenza already
doesn't like the moderns.

49:38.539 --> 49:41.909
"The Moderns"?
Is that what you call us?

49:41.943 --> 49:43.611
We call you a number
of different things,

49:43.644 --> 49:46.281
but I can't repeat them in
present company.

49:46.948 --> 49:50.319
You're such a gentleman.

49:50.352 --> 49:54.022
Look, if we don't get into the company,
it's because you're way too rigid.

49:54.055 --> 49:56.524
No, I'm not.

49:56.557 --> 49:59.527
Look, you know the choreography,
and you know the moves,

49:59.560 --> 50:02.963
but dance isn't just
some mathematical equation.

50:02.997 --> 50:05.667
You've gotta let go and be free.

50:05.700 --> 50:08.403
Don't be afraid to be
spontaneous.

50:08.435 --> 50:11.839
Yeah, well, if I'm too rigid, it's
because you're all over the place.

50:14.441 --> 50:17.378
I am only all over the place
because...

50:17.412 --> 50:19.080
Because what?

50:19.113 --> 50:23.117
Because Lorenza is, like, boring a
hole through my soul while I dance

50:23.151 --> 50:25.854
and who can be free
while that happens?

50:25.886 --> 50:27.589
Yeah.

50:28.490 --> 50:30.693
Yeah, you're right.

50:31.693 --> 50:33.461
Come on.

50:39.167 --> 50:42.069
Don't be scared
in Tommy's improv class.

50:42.102 --> 50:44.372
I'm not scared.

50:46.540 --> 50:49.410
What are you doing?

50:49.443 --> 50:52.546
Being spontaneous.

50:52.580 --> 50:55.384
# Set your wheels on fire #

51:25.979 --> 51:28.751
This can't happen.

51:30.484 --> 51:31.653
We're partners.

51:31.685 --> 51:34.890
Look, it's the oldest cliché
in the book.

51:34.923 --> 51:36.758
Partners hook up, and
everything's great and

51:36.790 --> 51:39.861
everything is fine
until it's not.

51:39.894 --> 51:41.582
And then everything's
ruined and the

51:41.583 --> 51:43.499
dance is ruined, and
everyone can see it.

51:44.899 --> 51:46.402
We all know the story.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.406
Yeah, I guess you're right.

51:52.874 --> 51:54.642
We have to be teammates.

51:54.676 --> 51:57.511
Then we'll get
into the company together.

51:57.544 --> 52:00.182
I'm in.

52:00.214 --> 52:02.417
Actually, I'm out,
'cause it's freezing.

52:04.618 --> 52:06.120
I thought we were teammates!

52:07.789 --> 52:09.892
Come on! Let's go get
Richard and Allegra.

52:17.265 --> 52:20.068
Work hard, play hard.
Let's hit it.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.470
Okay.

53:15.022 --> 53:16.825
That was intense, you guys.

53:16.857 --> 53:19.627
-Hard work pays off.
-Please.

53:28.169 --> 53:29.937
Six, seven...

53:48.923 --> 53:51.292
Yes, yes, fantastic work,
you guys, thank you.

53:51.325 --> 53:53.761
Guys, let's do it again. I want
you to watch them, all right?

53:53.794 --> 53:57.731
Strongest couple in the room.
You guys, do it like them.

53:57.765 --> 53:58.767
Okay.

53:58.800 --> 54:03.104
And seven,
eight... and...

54:06.673 --> 54:10.778
Five, six seven, eight.

54:10.812 --> 54:14.149
Leg straight. One, two...

54:14.182 --> 54:17.185
three, four...

54:17.218 --> 54:21.056
five, six...

54:21.089 --> 54:23.559
This should be perfect by now.

54:24.158 --> 54:25.993
From the top.

54:27.028 --> 54:29.196
From the top.

54:29.229 --> 54:31.632
And seven, eight.

54:31.665 --> 54:34.702
And a-one, two...

54:35.669 --> 54:38.872
three, four...

54:38.906 --> 54:40.809
five, six...

54:40.841 --> 54:43.744
seven... legs straight. And...

54:43.778 --> 54:45.915
Candie told me Ivan's
not coming back,

54:45.916 --> 54:48.216
and they're trying
to find her a partner.

54:48.249 --> 54:51.919
Damon! Damon. Can I talk to you?

54:53.655 --> 54:57.593
Listen, I'm going to talk to Jonathan
about getting you a new partner.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.178
Why?

55:00.179 --> 55:01.196
Come on.

55:01.229 --> 55:03.665
Bella's holding you back.

55:03.698 --> 55:06.935
What do you mean? I...
I thought she did great today.

55:06.968 --> 55:08.903
We both know
she'll never be a real dancer.

55:08.935 --> 55:12.374
This whole modern dance thing
is Jonathan trying to fundraise.

55:12.406 --> 55:14.529
He'll get over it,
and when he does,

55:14.530 --> 55:17.111
the modern dancers will
simply be discarded.

55:17.144 --> 55:21.115
I don't want you to get caught
up in it. You are far too good.

55:21.149 --> 55:23.417
No.

55:23.450 --> 55:24.719
No, what?

55:24.720 --> 55:25.987
I don't want a new partner.

56:06.794 --> 56:10.031
You're really good
at modern.

56:10.064 --> 56:12.801
You can be really good
at modern, too.

56:12.834 --> 56:15.403
So, we need to start practicing
before everyone else shows up.

56:15.435 --> 56:18.173
Yeah. Okay.

56:18.205 --> 56:20.040
What's wrong?

56:20.073 --> 56:21.709
I don't know.

56:21.743 --> 56:24.880
Modern, improv...
It just gets to my head.

56:25.345 --> 56:28.082
You can do it.

56:28.115 --> 56:30.017
Okay, listen...

56:30.051 --> 56:33.321
ballet is all about taking movement
and turning it into feelings.

56:33.354 --> 56:35.457
And you're amazing at it.

56:35.490 --> 56:37.192
Modern is just the opposite.

56:37.225 --> 56:40.060
It's taking your feelings
and turning it into movement.

56:40.093 --> 56:45.332
It's all about just expressing
yourself, and doing it from the heart.

56:45.365 --> 56:47.801
Just fill in the blanks.

56:47.834 --> 56:49.503
Feel in the blanks.

56:49.537 --> 56:51.272
"Feel in the blanks?"

56:54.274 --> 56:56.176
I think I can give it a shot.

56:56.209 --> 56:57.845
Okay, let's give it a shot.

57:01.848 --> 57:03.852
I'm going to tap you,
and you move. Ready?

57:05.486 --> 57:07.856
There you go.

57:08.955 --> 57:11.292
Okay, keep going.
Keep going.

59:04.537 --> 59:06.373
Thanks, Bella.

59:07.508 --> 59:09.194
Hi, guys.

59:09.195 --> 59:10.879
Sorry we're late.

59:11.511 --> 59:14.115
Well, let's get started.

59:14.147 --> 59:17.885
Okay, everybody, gather around,
please. Gather around.

59:17.919 --> 59:22.223
As all of you know, there's only a few
days left until the final audition.

59:22.256 --> 59:24.426
So I want you to look around
right now.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.029
Look around.

59:28.062 --> 59:30.632
These are not your friends.

59:30.664 --> 59:33.634
They're your competition.

59:33.667 --> 59:36.238
Understood?

59:37.437 --> 59:39.974
Dismissed.

59:43.544 --> 59:45.413
Good class today.

59:45.446 --> 59:46.865
Yeah. Thank you.

59:46.866 --> 59:48.283
Yeah.

59:48.316 --> 59:50.385
So, is it true?

59:50.417 --> 59:53.053
Is what true?
You're Kate Parker's sister.

59:53.086 --> 59:54.655
-What?
-That's what I heard.

59:54.689 --> 59:56.057
You're Kate Parker's sister?

59:56.089 --> 59:58.091
Well, yeah, I'm her sister.

59:58.124 --> 01:00:00.560
So you're what, just going
through the motions here?

01:00:00.593 --> 01:00:03.263
Did any of us actually have a
chance at getting ahead of you?

01:00:03.296 --> 01:00:05.300
Or have you had this deal
since day one?

01:00:05.332 --> 01:00:06.434
What deal?

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:09.537
That Kate will guest star
for the company next season,

01:00:09.569 --> 01:00:12.106
so long as you get accepted.

01:00:13.207 --> 01:00:16.144
Where did you all hear this?
Is this true?

01:00:16.176 --> 01:00:17.278
No.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:19.180
Why didn't you at least tell
me?

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:20.714
I didn't want anyone to know.

01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:23.050
Well, you must have told
someone.

01:00:28.222 --> 01:00:30.425
You told everyone Kate was
my sister?

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:34.028
And that she had some sort of a
bullshit deal going on with Jonathan?

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.432
Am I just another competitor
for you to eliminate?

01:00:37.464 --> 01:00:40.234
You really haven't changed
since Dallas, have you?

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.169
Partner up!

01:01:48.202 --> 01:01:51.272
Bella, where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

01:01:52.807 --> 01:01:56.209
What's going on?
Are you all right?

01:01:56.243 --> 01:02:00.181
Okay, let's begin with chassé,
fouetté into arabesque.

01:02:00.214 --> 01:02:02.150
Positions, please.

01:02:04.151 --> 01:02:07.455
And seven, eight.

01:02:07.488 --> 01:02:10.558
And a one, two...

01:02:10.591 --> 01:02:13.294
three, four...

01:02:13.327 --> 01:02:15.095
five, six...

01:02:15.129 --> 01:02:17.065
seven, eight.

01:02:18.298 --> 01:02:20.100
Are you trying to take me out?

01:02:20.133 --> 01:02:21.668
What is going on over there?

01:02:21.702 --> 01:02:25.173
Nothing, I just...
I'm sorry.

01:02:25.738 --> 01:02:27.175
Again!

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.662
Bella!

01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:33.514
Go away!

01:02:33.546 --> 01:02:36.583
I saw you running with Allegra, but
I really shouldn't be surprised.

01:02:36.617 --> 01:02:40.153
I guess the world is full of insecure
backstabbers and cutthroats.

01:02:40.187 --> 01:02:43.691
Bella, Allegra didn't
tell anyone about Kate.

01:02:43.723 --> 01:02:48.463
You asked her?
Yes, and it wasn't her.

01:02:48.495 --> 01:02:51.865
And I don't know who spread the rumor
about you and Jonathan having a deal...

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:55.470
But if you say it's not true,
then I believe you.

01:02:57.138 --> 01:02:58.706
Now, we need to focus.

01:02:58.738 --> 01:03:00.707
There's only a couple more days
before our final audition,

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.377
and I know you want to get
into the ABC as much as I do.

01:03:05.446 --> 01:03:08.583
We need to work together,
Bella...

01:03:08.615 --> 01:03:10.551
not against each other.

01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:15.489
Teammates, remember?

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:20.627
And you need
to talk to Allegra, not me.

01:03:28.502 --> 01:03:30.205
Hey.

01:03:34.274 --> 01:03:36.577
I owe you an apology.

01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:45.153
What happened in Dallas?

01:03:50.691 --> 01:03:52.694
I wasn't kicked out.

01:03:54.227 --> 01:03:56.497
Not by the faculty.

01:03:57.798 --> 01:04:00.334
I was run out by the other
dancers.

01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:04.271
Why?

01:04:05.372 --> 01:04:09.477
Charlotte Ostenberg.
My biggest rival.

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.613
She was my best friend, too.

01:04:14.214 --> 01:04:17.184
At least I thought she was.

01:04:17.218 --> 01:04:20.620
I couldn't figure out why
they hated me so much.

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:22.389
Everyone.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.392
Charlotte was telling the
other dancers

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:27.528
that I was saying terrible things
about them behind their back.

01:04:30.231 --> 01:04:33.301
I was so miserable
that I couldn't even dance.

01:04:34.868 --> 01:04:36.504
I just had to leave.

01:04:38.671 --> 01:04:39.973
But I can't leave here.

01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:42.409
This is my last year
to get into a company

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:44.879
and after what happened in
Dallas,

01:04:44.912 --> 01:04:47.515
no one else will even
let me audition.

01:04:51.551 --> 01:04:54.189
Bella...

01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:57.559
This is it for me.

01:05:01.995 --> 01:05:03.631
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.778 --> 01:05:21.982
All right, listen up.

01:05:22.015 --> 01:05:23.751
It's come to our attention

01:05:23.783 --> 01:05:28.289
that certain rumors have been
circulating about a deal with ABC?

01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:31.825
Let's get one thing straight.
This is unacceptable.

01:05:31.859 --> 01:05:35.496
There were absolutely no deals
made with Kate Parker.

01:05:35.528 --> 01:05:38.031
Nobody's spot here is
guaranteed.

01:05:38.064 --> 01:05:44.537
If any of you expect to have a career
here at the ABC, all of this ends now.

01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:47.441
You're not here to have fun. You
are here to be professionals.

01:05:47.473 --> 01:05:49.577
I don't care how good
any of you are at dance.

01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:52.512
If you can't respect each other,
you do not belong here.

01:05:52.546 --> 01:05:55.549
Once ABC's name has been
dragged through the mud,

01:05:55.582 --> 01:05:58.051
it's not a rumor, it's not
gossip. It's defamation.

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:01.888
So when we got wind of this yesterday,
we suspected Ivan. We called him.

01:06:01.921 --> 01:06:04.391
He admitted to authoring
that rumor.

01:06:04.425 --> 01:06:06.760
He realized if he
didn't confess,

01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:09.930
he would never get a chance to dance
at a company like this ever again.

01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:14.368
And to whomever else decided to
help spread this rumor around camp,

01:06:14.401 --> 01:06:16.037
do yourself a favor.

01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:18.305
Step forward.

01:06:21.675 --> 01:06:23.343
I did.

01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:26.514
It was me. I'm sorry.

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:33.721
Do you realize the damage a rumor
like this could have on a company?

01:06:36.122 --> 01:06:39.092
I called Ivan at the hospital.
He was angry.

01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:40.794
He told me
that you were Kate's sister,

01:06:40.827 --> 01:06:42.662
and that you would always
get into the company.

01:06:42.696 --> 01:06:47.034
That there was a deal.
I thought it was true.

01:06:47.066 --> 01:06:52.405
He told me that it wasn't fair, to
me or any of us, and I believed him.

01:06:52.439 --> 01:06:55.676
I realize now he was just
trying to get you to...

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:59.914
Quit? Is that it?

01:06:59.946 --> 01:07:03.416
He told me that if you left, I had
a better chance of getting in

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:05.687
because they couldn't
find me a partner.

01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:10.590
I'm so sorry, Bella.

01:07:12.459 --> 01:07:16.431
Well, Candie, thank you
for coming forward with that.

01:07:18.832 --> 01:07:20.768
I think I should leave.

01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:21.903
Yeah.

01:07:26.807 --> 01:07:28.876
You have two days
until your final audition.

01:07:28.908 --> 01:07:33.613
Okay, get out there,
practice, practice, practice.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.838
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:10:26.919 --> 01:10:29.524
Fancy yourself to be
a ballerina, do you?

01:10:31.691 --> 01:10:32.659
No.

01:10:32.693 --> 01:10:35.762
Well, that's good,
because you'll never be one.

01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:38.899
You've had some training,
but you'll never make the cut.

01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:41.635
I didn't come here
to be a ballerina.

01:10:41.668 --> 01:10:44.672
Jonathan doesn't
expect me to be a ballerina.

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:48.809
And what do you expect
of yourself?

01:10:48.842 --> 01:10:51.045
Other than to be
Kate Parker's sister?

01:10:51.078 --> 01:10:54.615
My sister didn't have any more
training than I had when I started.

01:10:54.647 --> 01:10:57.784
Yes, but she had talent.

01:10:57.818 --> 01:10:59.986
I started training when I was
four years old.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.056
And by the time I got accepted
into the Academy,

01:11:02.088 --> 01:11:05.825
I had already put in
thousands of hours...

01:11:05.859 --> 01:11:09.096
of blood, sweat, discipline.

01:11:09.128 --> 01:11:12.800
I earned my place in the
Academy.

01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:15.903
Well, you should have the same
expectations of me as everyone else.

01:11:15.936 --> 01:11:21.075
I expect greatness.
And I just don't see it.

01:11:21.107 --> 01:11:24.211
I'm sorry, I'm being honest.
You're young.

01:11:24.244 --> 01:11:28.149
You can find a different path,
and maybe even succeed.

01:11:31.851 --> 01:11:34.689
Well, Tommy and Jonathan
see something in me.

01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:37.658
And I know it.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:42.028
I may never be as good a ballerina as
you or Kate, but I'm okay with that.

01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:45.399
I didn't like ballet when
I got here.

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:48.802
I didn't even want
to see myself in a mirror.

01:11:49.936 --> 01:11:53.173
But the more I danced,
the less I cared.

01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:56.010
Look, you can try and mess with
my head, but it doesn't matter.

01:11:57.177 --> 01:11:59.046
You play the cards you're dealt.

01:11:59.079 --> 01:12:02.016
Maybe it's time you learnt
that for yourself.

01:12:02.048 --> 01:12:04.885
You injured yourself
15 years ago.

01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:06.921
You should get over that.

01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:10.857
Get out.

01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:14.195
I'm practicing.

01:12:47.894 --> 01:12:49.664
Hi.

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:52.232
Hey.

01:12:53.766 --> 01:12:55.868
What's up?

01:12:55.901 --> 01:12:58.204
Just thinking about tomorrow.

01:12:58.238 --> 01:13:02.042
It's a lot of pressure.

01:13:02.074 --> 01:13:04.944
Yeah, but we've
trained for that.

01:13:04.977 --> 01:13:07.213
Look at how far we've come.

01:13:07.247 --> 01:13:10.051
Everything will be great.

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:14.788
Yeah. Everything will be great.

01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:23.930
Have a good night.

01:13:24.364 --> 01:13:26.133
Yeah, you too.

01:13:35.242 --> 01:13:36.711
Bella!

01:13:37.276 --> 01:13:39.046
Yeah?

01:13:39.079 --> 01:13:41.081
I can't sleep.

01:13:41.114 --> 01:13:44.285
I don't think anyone
can sleep tonight.

01:13:58.131 --> 01:13:59.200
Come in!

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.437
Hey, what's up?

01:14:04.471 --> 01:14:06.807
Why aren't you in your
outfit yet?

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:09.176
Vanessa called.

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:13.212
There's this new dance company,
and her dad's involved.

01:14:13.245 --> 01:14:15.382
Yeah?

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:18.785
They've already made me an offer, but I
have to be in Paris for tomorrow night.

01:14:18.819 --> 01:14:21.789
And I'm taking it.
My flight leaves in three hours.

01:14:24.123 --> 01:14:26.425
What?

01:14:26.458 --> 01:14:32.832
No! No, you don't have to be in
Paris by tomorrow. That's crazy.

01:14:32.865 --> 01:14:36.470
You're caving. You're
caving in to the pressure.

01:14:36.503 --> 01:14:39.907
Please, Richard,
I know we can do this.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.009
What if we don't?

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:45.245
Paris is a sure thing.
I'm sorry.

01:15:17.644 --> 01:15:19.814
What's wrong?

01:15:20.512 --> 01:15:23.016
Richard left.

01:15:25.051 --> 01:15:27.021
Bella, I don't know what to do.

01:15:28.888 --> 01:15:32.092
I don't have a partner,
so I can't even audition.

01:15:35.462 --> 01:15:37.198
Yeah, you can.

01:15:38.498 --> 01:15:40.234
This is it.

01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:43.169
Everything you've worked
towards for the past six weeks,

01:15:43.203 --> 01:15:47.074
everything you've dreamt of since
that very first dance class.

01:15:47.106 --> 01:15:49.342
Today's the day
you'll never forget.

01:15:49.376 --> 01:15:51.611
And just in case that's
not enough motivation for you,

01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:54.948
we have a very special guest
judge today.

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:57.251
Cooper Nielsen.

01:15:57.284 --> 01:16:01.121
Hello everybody. I'm really looking
forward to seeing what you got.

01:16:01.154 --> 01:16:02.923
And Jonathan pretty
much has it covered,

01:16:02.955 --> 01:16:06.092
but there's one thing he
forgot to mention.

01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:08.561
One very important thing.

01:16:08.595 --> 01:16:10.129
Have fun out there.

01:16:11.530 --> 01:16:13.967
Let's begin.

01:18:04.177 --> 01:18:08.214
Damon and Bella? You're up.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:17.090
I won't be dancing
at today's audition.

01:18:17.123 --> 01:18:18.759
Bella, what are you
talking about?

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.128
Where does this leave
your partner?

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:26.633
Richard got accepted
to a dance company in Paris

01:18:26.665 --> 01:18:28.702
and he left this morning.

01:18:28.735 --> 01:18:32.572
So that leaves Allegra without
a partner.

01:18:32.605 --> 01:18:34.408
I want her to take my place.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.044
She's the best dancer here
and she deserves this chance.

01:18:38.511 --> 01:18:41.114
More than I do.

01:18:41.146 --> 01:18:44.150
Are you sure?

01:18:46.418 --> 01:18:49.389
All right.
I accept your decision.

01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:53.459
Damon, Allegra, it's all yours.

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:23.589
No... I can't.

01:19:32.565 --> 01:19:36.270
What are you doing?
Just feeling in the blanks.

01:19:39.239 --> 01:19:41.607
This is supposed to be a duet!

01:19:41.641 --> 01:19:42.843
Let them go.

01:19:42.876 --> 01:19:46.378
# Forgive me for
my selfish ways #

01:19:46.412 --> 01:19:50.217
# Why don't you talk to me #

01:19:52.418 --> 01:19:56.455
# I'm just tryin' to feel
the love again #

01:19:56.489 --> 01:20:00.394
# I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #

01:20:02.361 --> 01:20:06.232
# Why don't you talk to me #

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.471
# I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #

01:20:12.504 --> 01:20:16.376
# I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #

01:20:34.526 --> 01:20:36.896
# You were never there for me #

01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:38.765
# Like I was for you #

01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:40.833
# Show me what it means to
love #

01:20:40.867 --> 01:20:42.435
# I guess you never know #

01:20:42.467 --> 01:20:45.238
# And it hurts so
you can't breathe #

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.472
# Dance the pain away #

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:48.742
# You kiss me like you mean it #

01:20:48.775 --> 01:20:52.546
# Why can't you ever stay #

01:20:52.579 --> 01:20:56.683
# Stay, ho #

01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:02.689
# Why don't you talk to me #

01:21:04.457 --> 01:21:08.427
# I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #

01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:12.266
# I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #

01:21:20.472 --> 01:21:24.410
<i># I'm just
tryin' to feel the love again #</i>

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:28.281
<i># I'm just tryin' to
feel the love again #</i>

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.297
Since you presented yourselves as
one, we'll judge you that way.

01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:48.601
You'll all
get into the studio company...

01:21:48.635 --> 01:21:52.672
or you all won't
get into the studio company.

01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:55.475
We'll have the
results for you shortly.

01:22:03.615 --> 01:22:08.254
Well, I should let my parents
know what's happening.

01:22:13.559 --> 01:22:16.262
Come on. Take a walk with me.

01:22:19.364 --> 01:22:21.635
You guys really
shouldn't have done that.

01:22:22.435 --> 01:22:24.337
You wanted to see me?

01:22:24.369 --> 01:22:26.239
Here, have a seat.

01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:32.612
We've watched you grow
into a wonderful dancer, Gwen.

01:22:32.645 --> 01:22:37.851
However, we feel you're still
not quite ready for the company.

01:22:37.883 --> 01:22:41.654
But we have reserved a spot for you
in the Academy, if you're interested.

01:22:43.556 --> 01:22:45.392
-No way.
-Way.

01:22:45.425 --> 01:22:47.494
Of course I'm interested!

01:22:47.526 --> 01:22:49.561
Thank you so much.
Can I give you a hug?

01:22:49.595 --> 01:22:50.695
Sure.

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:54.267
Thank you. Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Thank you.

01:22:57.537 --> 01:23:00.406
The ABC isn't
everything, though.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.909
I guess I don't even want
to dance there that badly.

01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:05.544
Yeah, you do.

01:23:06.678 --> 01:23:08.748
Okay. Yeah, I do.

01:23:12.452 --> 01:23:14.655
There's something I want
even more right now.

01:23:15.788 --> 01:23:18.425
And what would that be?

01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.972
Get a room, you two.

01:23:34.006 --> 01:23:36.943
My god.
I didn't even see you.

01:23:36.976 --> 01:23:39.012
Really? You didn't see me?

01:23:39.044 --> 01:23:41.013
I wonder why.

01:23:41.047 --> 01:23:42.716
So what did
your parents have to say?

01:23:46.084 --> 01:23:49.122
Guys, it's the results.

01:23:52.992 --> 01:23:54.794
We all look together.

01:23:56.895 --> 01:24:00.699

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:15.415
# I was born in a thunderstorm #

01:24:15.448 --> 01:24:20.119
# I grew up overnight #

01:24:20.153 --> 01:24:23.856
# I played alone
I played on my own #

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:26.760
# I survived #

01:24:28.794 --> 01:24:30.029
# Hey #

01:24:30.061 --> 01:24:34.133
# I wanted everything
I never had #

01:24:34.167 --> 01:24:39.472
# Like the love that
comes with light #

01:24:39.504 --> 01:24:43.142
# I wore envy and I hated that #

01:24:43.176 --> 01:24:48.013
# But I survived #

01:24:48.047 --> 01:24:53.153
# I had a one-way ticket to a
place where all the demons go #

01:24:53.186 --> 01:24:54.754
# Where the wind don't change #

01:24:54.787 --> 01:24:57.957

ground can ever grow #

# No hope, just lies #

01:24:59.592 --> 01:25:02.495
# And you're taught to
cry in your pillow #

01:25:02.528 --> 01:25:06.732
# But I survived #

01:25:06.766 --> 01:25:11.838
# I'm still breathing,
I'm still breathing #

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:16.909
# I'm still breathing,
I'm still breathing #

01:25:16.943 --> 01:25:21.815

# I'm alive #

01:25:30.957 --> 01:25:33.059
Jonathan really nailed it.

01:25:33.092 --> 01:25:34.561
Brilliant, isn't it?

01:25:37.096 --> 01:25:38.464
Fine.

01:25:38.498 --> 01:25:41.568
#...In the strangest place #

01:25:41.601 --> 01:25:46.606
# Way in the back of my mind #

01:25:46.638 --> 01:25:51.211
# I saw my life in
a stranger's face #

01:25:51.244 --> 01:25:54.948
# And it was mine #

01:25:54.980 --> 01:26:00.486
# I had a one-way ticket to a

01:26:52.171 --> 01:26:54.039
Bravo!

01:27:17.329 --> 01:27:19.932
You did it, Miss Parker.

01:27:19.966 --> 01:27:21.767
Thank you.

01:27:38.351 --> 01:27:41.354
What are you doing here?

01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:43.690
Do you think I'd miss
my sister's debut show?

01:27:43.722 --> 01:27:45.190
From half-way around the world?

01:27:45.223 --> 01:27:47.793
Are you kidding? I wouldn't
miss this for anything.

01:27:47.827 --> 01:27:49.861
Couple of peas in a pod,
we are.

01:27:49.895 --> 01:27:51.263
Don't I know it.

01:27:51.297 --> 01:27:52.665
It's good to see you!

01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:54.734
Come and meet
some of my friends.

01:27:54.766 --> 01:27:57.369
Yeah, I'm sure some of them
have already heard of you.

01:27:57.403 --> 01:27:59.806
Allegra!
This is Kate, my sister.

01:27:59.838 --> 01:28:01.207
-Hi!
-Hi!

01:28:01.239 --> 01:28:03.809
You're so good.
That was amazing.

01:28:03.842 --> 01:28:05.811
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:28:05.845 --> 01:28:09.115
My goodness! Yes! Your lift
was amazing at the end.

01:28:26.031 --> 01:28:27.700
Myron...

01:28:30.035 --> 01:28:31.837
So...

01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:34.740
the young dance prodigy returns.

01:28:35.341 --> 01:28:36.626
Looking for a job?

01:28:36.627 --> 01:28:37.910
No.

01:28:37.943 --> 01:28:41.681
Actually, I'm with the
Studio Company... at the ABC.

01:28:41.713 --> 01:28:44.917
You gotta be kidding.

01:28:47.052 --> 01:28:49.287
How's the pie?

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.725
Better with company.

01:28:53.993 --> 01:28:56.162
Thank you.

01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:16.015

# And I'm tryna see what

01:30:37.962 --> 01:30:39.831
# Are you a Gemini or a Leo? #

# I'm a Taurus,

# A little famous,

# And where we see

# Pull up, pull up # # Blonde,
redhead, to a brunette #

01:30:55.413 --> 01:30:57.349
# Pull up, pull up # # I see

# Pull up, pull up #

01:30:59.150 --> 01:31:00.852
# From the front view to
the silhouette, you a threat #

01:31:00.886 --> 01:31:02.254
# Even I'll have that
body in debt #

01:31:02.288 --> 01:31:04.857
# You know that chick,
she's fine #

01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:07.827
# You know she's bad
as how she looks, she's mine #

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.262
# All mine #

01:31:09.294 --> 01:31:12.498
# She's all I want and I need,
no lie #

01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:14.266
# I ain't wastin' no time #

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.569
# You see her fooling around
'cause she a... #

01:31:16.601 --> 01:31:18.570
# Hold up! Wait a minute! #

01:31:18.604 --> 01:31:20.906
# Minute, minute, minute # # That
chick, that chick right there #

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.275
# That chick, that
chick right there #

01:31:22.307 --> 01:31:23.975
# That girl #

01:31:24.008 --> 01:31:25.811
# That chick, that
chick right there #

01:31:25.845 --> 01:31:26.846
# That chick, that
chick right there #

01:31:26.878 --> 01:31:28.280

01:31:28.314 --> 01:31:29.949
# That chick, that
chick right there #

01:31:29.981 --> 01:31:31.016
# That chick,
that chick right there #

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:32.584
# That chick right there #

01:31:32.618 --> 01:31:34.120
# That chick, that
chick right there #

01:31:34.153 --> 01:31:35.421
# That chick, that chick
right there #

01:31:35.454 --> 01:31:37.223
# She a little off to the left #

01:31:37.256 --> 01:31:39.124
# Skirt showing all the goodies
in the La Senza she got left #

01:31:39.158 --> 01:31:41.227
# Now she off to the right #
# To the right #

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.229
# With about five guys following
behind her all night #

01:31:43.262 --> 01:31:45.598
# She putting them
seams to the test #

01:31:45.631 --> 01:31:47.600
# It seems that seam
cannot cover the brrr... #

01:31:47.632 --> 01:31:49.267
# Heart pumping
like a 20-minute workout #

01:31:49.301 --> 01:31:51.437
# She in control,
keep Captain Kirk out #

01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:53.439
# See the twerk there?
See the body bounce? #

01:31:53.471 --> 01:31:55.874
# You know that she only dip
when it really counts #

01:31:55.908 --> 01:31:57.543
# Animal prints
on undergarments #

01:31:57.575 --> 01:31:59.544
# Give me one touch,
I'm on it #

01:31:59.578 --> 01:32:02.013
# On it, on it # # You know
