WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:02.360
Well, Mr. Magnum,
can you do it?

00:02.436 --> 00:03.733
Can you find my father?

00:03.804 --> 00:07.740
They got no record
of a Tran Quoc Jones or
anybody even asking about him.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.335
My mother took me
to live with her family.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.641
One day some men came
and took her away.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.648
They killed her because
she had married my father.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.115
I wish I could undo that
for you.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.243
He seemed quite anxious
to try and help out.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.447
He's using Tran Quoc
as a political ploy.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.649
Where's Tran Quoc?
I don't know
where they came from.

00:23.724 --> 00:24.748
Where's the boy?

00:24.825 --> 00:27.385
You think they're really
gonna just let him go?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.053
Hey, that's mine!
T. C!

02:24.445 --> 02:25.503
How much for this?

02:25.579 --> 02:26.671
That's not for sale.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.477
Would you like
this necklace?

02:30.551 --> 02:31.848
Only $15.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.484
Last one.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.722
I'll make you a deal.
$12, wholesale.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.626
Okay, I'll take it. Can you
put it in a bag for me?

02:48.769 --> 02:51.203
Here you go, lady.
Hey, that's mine!

02:51.272 --> 02:52.933
Meet me right here
in one hour.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.668
You come back here with that!

02:54.742 --> 02:56.471
Come back here.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.072
<i>Speech, speech, speech...</i>

03:36.817 --> 03:40.446
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>what it means to me</i>
<i>to see all of you here today.</i>

03:40.888 --> 03:44.517
I don't believe this guy.
We're over in Vietnam
getting our butts shot off,

03:44.592 --> 03:47.789
while he's on a stage
burning his draft card
in Central Park.

03:47.861 --> 03:51.092
Now he's telling everybody
to vote for him
and work through the system.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.757
Well, times change,
I guess.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.665
So do people,
apparently.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.001
<i>...and hard work</i>
<i>are values of the past.</i>
<i>I disagree.</i>

03:59.807 --> 04:02.742
<i>Old-time American values</i>
<i>will never go out of style.</i>

04:02.810 --> 04:03.834
Thomas.

04:03.944 --> 04:08.108
I do not see how Robin Masters
can throw a fundraiser
for this creep,

04:08.182 --> 04:09.672
and I don't see
how you can help him.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.978
I'm not helping him.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.609
Yes, you are.
You're helping him
raise money.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.018
I am not.
I'm just doing the job
Robin asked me to do.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.077
No!

04:16.156 --> 04:17.646
I feel the same way
about Hasley you do.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.692
Sure.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.783
What am I supposed to do?
Quit my job?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.918
I wanna talk to you.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.223
No. Now, that's it.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.230
You're not gonna put me
on the defensive on this.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.892
I'm not working for Hasley
and I'm not gonna talk
about it anymore.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.696
Who said anything
about Hasley?

04:28.769 --> 04:32.136
Look, Thomas, you wanna take
an ad out in the yellow pages,
that's your business,

04:32.206 --> 04:34.640
but don't use
the club phone number
for your messages.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.902
You gave out
this number?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.500
I was just trying
to cover my bases.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.978
I didn't think you'd mind
taking a couple
of messages for me.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.607
A couple?
Try 15 in the last two days.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.548
Fifteen?
That's great.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.779
Eleven crank calls
and three hang ups.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.549
I'm getting a little tired
of people calling up

04:48.622 --> 04:50.613
and yelling and calling me
dirty names over the phone.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.386
Well, I figured
you'd be used to that by now.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.121
Very funny. I suppose
it doesn't bother you

04:55.195 --> 04:57.060
that he advertised
helicopter service.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.394
Wait a minute. You advertised
helicopter service?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.763
That's only 14!

05:00.834 --> 05:04.031
Eleven crank calls
and three hang ups. That's 14.
Who was the 15th?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.732
That friend of yours,
Jim Bonig or Joe Travis,
or whatever his name is.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.365
Mac. He said
to call him Mac.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.431
I don't want
to call him Mac.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.307
Anyway, he wants you to get
ahold of him right away.
Here's the address.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.472
Well, I can't go right now.
I'm waiting to meet a client.

05:14.548 --> 05:17.346
You advertised
helicopter service?
Honey Lester.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.648
Honey Lester?
Yes, she's meeting me here
at 10:00

05:19.720 --> 05:21.517
and she's just running
a little late, that's all.

05:21.588 --> 05:22.577
Well, while you're waiting,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.851
maybe you'd better
place a call
to the phone company

05:24.925 --> 05:27.450
and tell them to strike
this helicopter service.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.497
You wouldn't want anyone to
sue you for false advertising.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.561
Magnum, somebody's
looking for you.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.795
See? I told you.
She's just a little late.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.858
Where?

05:36.937 --> 05:37.995
Over there.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.330
That don't look
like any Honey Lester to me.

05:41.408 --> 05:45.208
Well, he says his name
is Tran Quoc Jones.
I think that's Vietnamese.

05:45.279 --> 05:48.339
Anyway, he said
he needs to talk to you
and it's confidential.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.686
My father gave those
to my mother

05:55.522 --> 05:57.820
the night
before he shipped out.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.020
He was going to send for us
as soon as he got back
to America.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.659
But my mother died,

06:08.102 --> 06:09.831
so I guess
he couldn't find me.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.738
At the orphanage,
they taught me not to be angry
about the past.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.177
Look to the future.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.614
So, I began to dream
about coming to America

06:22.783 --> 06:24.182
to find my father.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.285
But here I am,

06:32.159 --> 06:33.922
and I can't find him.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.962
There you go.

06:38.465 --> 06:41.901
You don't need
a private investigator.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.802
See, there are agencies
that are already set up

06:44.872 --> 06:46.464
for getting families
back together.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.598
I can take you over
to one of them.

06:47.674 --> 06:48.663
No!

06:50.010 --> 06:53.343
I'm not exactly
supposed to be here.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.845
I kind of bought my way in.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.215
These agencies,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.883
I'm scared
they'll send me back.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.056
Where do you get
the kind of money

07:08.195 --> 07:10.129
to buy your way
into the States?

07:10.364 --> 07:12.662
Same place I learned
to speak English,

07:12.733 --> 07:15.395
hustling big hotels
in Ho Chi Minh City.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.936
I speak pretty good, huh?

07:18.305 --> 07:19.431
Very good.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.564
Here you go.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.271
One chocolate milk

07:24.144 --> 07:25.577
on the house.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.815
"On the house"?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.383
It means free.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.112
Thanks.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.550
On the house.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.126
Well, Mr. Magnum,
can you do it?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.365
Can you find my father?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.334
Why don't you tell me
all you know about him?

07:55.976 --> 07:59.468
He was a helicopter pilot
and his name is Jones.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.207
We heard he came
through Hawaii
on his way back home.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.189
<i>I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking,</i>
<i>and you're right.</i>

08:11.258 --> 08:12.816
<i>What were the odds</i>
<i>of my finding</i>

08:12.893 --> 08:14.554
<i>the one helicopter pilot</i>
<i>named Jones,</i>

08:14.628 --> 08:18.359
<i>who left a wife and infant son</i>
<i>behind in Vietnam</i>
<i>almost 12 years ago?</i>

08:19.066 --> 08:21.364
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>the odds weren't</i>
<i>gonna get any better</i>

08:21.435 --> 08:23.027
<i>if I turned the boy down.</i>

08:23.103 --> 08:25.230
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>was to keep him out of sight,</i>

08:25.305 --> 08:28.103
<i>so immigration</i>
<i>couldn't find him</i>
<i>before I located his dad.</i>

08:30.077 --> 08:32.375
This Higgins,
he is a cruel man?

08:32.446 --> 08:35.539
Not cruel, exactly.
More like set in his ways.

08:35.782 --> 08:39.683
Like Phap Quong.
He was the <i>thay tru tri</i>
at the orphanage.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.253
Very stubborn.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.256
I had to concentrate
and concentrate

08:44.558 --> 08:46.389
to figure out
how to be his friend.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.457
Yeah, well, what I think
you should concentrate on here

08:49.530 --> 08:51.157
is staying out of
Higgins' way.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.195
I think we made it.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.531
Where's your Hotei statue?

08:58.605 --> 08:59.799
What?

08:59.873 --> 09:03.172
Your good-luck statue.
You know, the short,
round little man.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.268
Don't you keep one
outside your door?

09:07.948 --> 09:11.748
Uh, some people
keep them inside.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.876
Higgins.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.649
I have been standing here
for precisely 17 minutes,

09:15.722 --> 09:18.953
a sufficient amount of time
to weigh carefully
the words I shall use

09:19.026 --> 09:21.995
to describe to Mr. Masters
your appalling lack of concern

09:22.062 --> 09:23.962
about a matter
he has entrusted
to your care.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.022
Higgins, I'm sorry.
Look, I know we had a meeting.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.262
I meant to be on time,
but I got held up
waiting for a client.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.804
You're taking money
from children?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.541
Oh, no,
he's not my client.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.202
Well, I mean,
he is my client,

09:40.280 --> 09:41.804
but he's not the client
I went to meet.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.679
He is the client
that showed up.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.378
Anyway, Higgins,
it doesn't matter who he is.

09:46.453 --> 09:49.251
What matters is my taking care
of a few minor details,

09:49.323 --> 09:52.224
so that you and I
can then discuss
the matter of security

09:52.292 --> 09:53.691
for the fundraiser
Robin's throwing.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.749
Quite.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.728
I just have
one quick trip to Waikiki.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.357
This lad, this mere child,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.423
is your client?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.269
Well, in a manner
of speaking, yes.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.670
How on earth do they find you?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.209
Yellow pages.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.111
Of course.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.646
I should have guessed.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.453
So far, so good.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.319
The important thing now is...

10:24.391 --> 10:27.292
Stay out of Higgins' way.
...of Higgins' way.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.188
Watch TV, read a book,
take a nap.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.197
The bathroom's in there,
there's beer...

10:32.265 --> 10:33.926
Milk and cookies
in the refrigerator.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.595
Don't wander off.
Stay in the guest house.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.033
You gonna be okay?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.037
Are you kidding?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.354
<i>Are you crazy?</i>
<i>You wanna get killed?</i>

11:04.464 --> 11:08.059
No, I'm just
trying to run
a nice little business here.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.161
You know,
sell a few pineapples,
enjoy the good life.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.167
You know, it's the
American birthright, Thomas,
the pursuit of happiness.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.799
What's the pursuit
of happiness got to do with

11:15.876 --> 11:17.867
bumping heads
with some hood?

11:17.944 --> 11:21.243
Thomas, you see all these
little stands around here?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.513
Each one of these
little stands

11:23.583 --> 11:25.312
is a little island
of free enterprise.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.353
Each one run by someone

11:27.421 --> 11:30.720
who's working very hard
just to get by.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.720
Now, if all these people

11:32.793 --> 11:35.227
have to keep paying
protection money
every month...

11:35.295 --> 11:36.785
I am not saying
they should pay.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.093
I just think
they should call the police,
that's all.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.602
What good could they do?
If they come around,
the bagman doesn't show up.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.365
And they can't really run
a con on him, you see,
'cause that's entrapment.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.805
They got to be real careful
about those things.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.372
Now, look, you help me
with this, and I'll see
what I can do at NIA.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.417
I don't know.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.016
What's the set-up?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.715
Well, everyone's agreed
to give me
their protection money

12:02.789 --> 12:03.813
for this next pickup.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.858
Now, I flash the money
at the bagman,

12:05.926 --> 12:07.826
and then I pull a switch
and give it to you,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.419
and you wait for me
over there by that aquarium.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.159
Then the bagman
takes an envelope
full of paper towels,

12:13.233 --> 12:15.861
and you and I
hand all these people back
their money.

12:15.936 --> 12:19.167
And when he realizes
he's been had
and comes looking for us?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.833
Well, first of all,
they'll never really get
a good look at you.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.466
And, secondly,
I can take care of myself.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.340
You don't have to worry
about me.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.640
Now, what do you say?

12:28.949 --> 12:31.611
Look, if you really
don't wanna do this,
I understand.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.654
I mean, it's dangerous.
Really, really,
forget I asked.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.281
It's okay. I mean, you're busy
trying to find
this kid's father.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.191
I can see
you just don't have time
to help out a few nice people.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.559
If I agree to do this, if,

12:46.833 --> 12:50.132
you will get into NIA
and see what you can find
on the boy's father?

12:51.505 --> 12:52.995
You got yourself a deal.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.613
Now, why don't we go someplace
you can buy me a beer

13:01.681 --> 13:03.615
and tell me what it is
you're looking for.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.173
Business is a little
slow here, anyway.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.584
I guess people
are still spooked
by that murder.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.985
What murder?

13:09.055 --> 13:11.285
They found
a high-priced callgirl
over in the alleyway

13:11.358 --> 13:14.521
between the Hawaii Art Mart
and Kuhio Souvenirs.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.290
You know, she looked
more like a college girl
than a hooker.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.061
All they found on her
was 1,500 bucks
and a driver's license.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.861
Honey Lester. Where do they
come up with these...

13:23.937 --> 13:25.268
Honey Lester?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.635
Yeah, you know her?

13:32.261 --> 13:34.354
<i>There's</i>
<i>a special kind of bond</i>

13:34.429 --> 13:37.159
<i>between a private investigator</i>
<i>and a client.</i>

13:37.232 --> 13:40.201
<i>If it's not trust,</i>
<i>it's something</i>
<i>very much like it.</i>

13:40.502 --> 13:42.868
<i>I saw it</i>
<i>in Tran Quoc Jones' eyes</i>

13:42.938 --> 13:45.338
<i>when he asked me</i>
<i>if I could find his father.</i>

13:45.407 --> 13:48.308
<i>And I felt it in my heart</i>
<i>when I heard Honey Lester,</i>

13:48.377 --> 13:51.175
<i>a client I hadn't even met,</i>
<i>had been killed.</i>

13:51.246 --> 13:52.804
<i>I felt I had to do</i>
<i>what I could</i>

13:52.881 --> 13:54.746
<i>to find out</i>
<i>why Honey had called me.</i>

13:55.317 --> 13:58.013
<i>I asked Rick to see</i>
<i>what he could find out</i>
<i>about her.</i>

13:58.487 --> 14:01.047
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>I had to make sure</i>
<i>my other client</i>

14:01.123 --> 14:03.648
<i>was keeping a low profile</i>
<i>around the estate.</i>

14:09.464 --> 14:12.797
Magnum, I want to talk
to you immediately.

14:21.510 --> 14:24.172
I demand to know
what you're doing
about that boy.

14:24.246 --> 14:25.770
To tell you
the truth, Higgins,

14:25.847 --> 14:28.782
I was kind of hoping
you wouldn't notice
he was staying here.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.444
I mean, look,
I know you got this big
shindig coming up, but...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.988
I would hardly call
Mr. Masters'
fundraising dinner

14:34.056 --> 14:36.490
for his chosen candidate
a shindig.

14:36.558 --> 14:39.618
Well, whatever. The thing is,
I think Tran Quoc can stay
out of the way.

14:39.695 --> 14:42.289
What's the big deal
if he stays here
for a couple of days?

14:42.364 --> 14:45.060
I'm not in the least concerned
about his staying here.

14:45.434 --> 14:46.458
You're not?

14:46.535 --> 14:47.559
No.

14:47.769 --> 14:51.170
What concerns me
is what you're doing
to find the boy's father.

14:52.507 --> 14:55.601
Well, I have a couple
of operatives working on it.

14:56.144 --> 14:57.133
Good.

14:57.212 --> 14:59.806
As you know, there's
an enormous amount of work
to be done around here

14:59.881 --> 15:01.815
to ensure security
for the fundraiser.

15:01.883 --> 15:05.250
Yeah, I know.
I kind of wanted
to talk to you about that.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.618
See, I've been kind of having
second thoughts...

15:07.689 --> 15:08.883
However,
under the circumstances,

15:08.957 --> 15:11.357
I am willing
to burden most of that work

15:11.426 --> 15:14.259
in order to free up your time
to find the boy's father.

15:14.696 --> 15:15.685
You are?

15:19.134 --> 15:20.123
Gee.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.159
Thanks, Higgins.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.837
Why are you doing this?

15:28.243 --> 15:30.905
If you had a son
who was trying to find you,

15:31.246 --> 15:35.239
wouldn't you hope the people
he turned to would help him
in that quest?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.818
Besides,
I rather like the lad.

15:41.423 --> 15:43.220
He told me,
quite in confidence,

15:43.292 --> 15:46.056
that I reminded him of someone
he was very close to.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.186
The <i>thay tru tri</i>
of the orphanage
where he grew up,

15:49.264 --> 15:50.526
as a matter of fact.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.465
I suppose I always have had
a rather authoritative air
about me.

15:54.636 --> 15:58.072
I remember the first time
I was bundled off
to military school.

15:58.373 --> 16:01.638
I couldn't have been more than
seven years old at the time,

16:02.010 --> 16:05.946
but, even then, the lads
apparently saw in me
the makings of a leader.

16:06.381 --> 16:10.181
The school was located
on the rainy and windswept
coast of...

16:15.457 --> 16:16.549
Pity.

16:17.659 --> 16:19.217
He would've enjoyed this one.

16:20.395 --> 16:22.260
But I didn't lie
to Mr. Higgins.

16:22.331 --> 16:24.629
You led him to believe...

16:24.700 --> 16:26.964
You led him
to believe one thing,

16:27.035 --> 16:28.866
when you really meant
something else.

16:28.937 --> 16:30.495
Pretty smart, huh?

16:35.577 --> 16:37.374
That's really very good.

16:37.446 --> 16:39.437
How long you been playing
the saxophone?

16:39.514 --> 16:40.913
For a couple of months.

16:40.982 --> 16:43.542
I started playing for change
outside of hotels

16:43.618 --> 16:45.415
just before I came here.

16:45.487 --> 16:47.478
How long
have you been playing?

16:47.556 --> 16:49.615
Oh, since high school.

16:50.459 --> 16:52.222
You must be really good.

16:53.228 --> 16:54.786
Here, play something for me.

16:54.863 --> 16:55.887
No.

16:55.964 --> 16:59.991
Look, it's time for you
to hit the sack. We got lots
to do tomorrow.

17:00.402 --> 17:02.029
Oh, I almost forgot.

17:03.238 --> 17:04.796
Your friend Rick called.

17:04.873 --> 17:07.808
He said to tell you
he's got some "feelers out"

17:07.876 --> 17:10.140
and he'll get "the skinny
on that dame."

17:10.945 --> 17:13.710
He also said he'd help me
with English, anytime.

17:13.982 --> 17:15.279
Great.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.942
And Mr. Calvin called.

17:17.018 --> 17:20.818
He said, "Did you take care
of that false
advertising matter?"

17:21.957 --> 17:24.482
He also said
for me to call him T.C.,

17:24.559 --> 17:27.925
and he invited me to go flying
in his helicopter tomorrow.

17:29.931 --> 17:31.523
Oh, he did, did he?

17:31.600 --> 17:34.034
He invited me
of his own free will.

17:34.102 --> 17:38.766
What I said was,
I'd be happy to take him
on a helicopter ride sometime.

17:38.907 --> 17:40.738
That's what I said.

17:40.809 --> 17:43.903
He's just a kid.
You know how excited
they can get.

17:44.212 --> 17:46.407
Besides, maybe
his English isn't very good.

17:46.481 --> 17:48.278
He probably
misunderstood you.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.409
That boy's English is great.

17:52.487 --> 17:54.512
Maybe we should take him
with us.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.250
It could be interesting.

17:56.324 --> 17:57.621
No.

17:57.692 --> 17:59.557
Magnum dropped him off here,

17:59.628 --> 18:03.189
we're gonna drop him off
right back there
and Higgins can baby-sit.

18:03.331 --> 18:06.459
Now, I planned on a picnic
for two, not three.

18:08.203 --> 18:10.171
You're right,
Mr. Calvin.

18:10.605 --> 18:12.505
It was wrong of me
to trick you.

18:13.942 --> 18:16.433
Every morning
I wake up and I think,

18:17.012 --> 18:19.572
this might be
my last day in America.

18:21.149 --> 18:23.913
Today might be the day
they come and get me

18:24.453 --> 18:26.080
and send me back,

18:28.290 --> 18:31.782
so I try to fill my mind
with as many pictures
as I can,

18:32.928 --> 18:35.089
so I'll have something
to remember

18:35.664 --> 18:37.427
when I'm back
in the orphanage.

18:46.975 --> 18:49.535
But I should try
to find my own pictures,

18:50.045 --> 18:52.104
and not take yours
away from you.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.821
He wouldn't be taking
anything away from us.

19:02.824 --> 19:04.052
T.C.

19:05.327 --> 19:07.693
T.Q., where you going?

19:08.163 --> 19:10.461
Back to Mr. Magnum's house.

19:10.532 --> 19:13.330
What, and let
all this good food
go to waste?

19:13.702 --> 19:15.897
You mean I can come along?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.398
T. C: Sure,

19:17.873 --> 19:20.467
if you're in the chopper
by the time I count to ten.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.510
One, two, three, four, five...

19:27.816 --> 19:31.752
You know, some days
I can really see
what it is I see in you.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.416
<i>As far as I can see,</i>
<i>nobody wants this guy.</i>

19:36.191 --> 19:39.058
Oh, I got your list
of all the Joneses
mustered out in Hawaii.

19:39.127 --> 19:40.287
It's a pretty long list.

19:40.362 --> 19:42.922
I also contacted somebody at
the Pearl S. Buck Foundation.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.192
You called Washington?

19:44.266 --> 19:47.861
Yeah. As long as I was there,
I figured the Navy
could afford it.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.633
They got no record
of a Tran Quoc Jones or
anybody even asking about him.

19:51.706 --> 19:54.140
The State Department said
they'll keep looking,

19:54.209 --> 19:56.302
but at first glance,
they didn't have anything
on the guy, either.

19:56.378 --> 19:57.777
Anybody you didn't call?

19:57.846 --> 19:59.040
My mother.

19:59.114 --> 20:02.709
I started to,
but I heard some footsteps
coming down the hall.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.275
I'll call the State Department
back in a couple of days.

20:05.353 --> 20:07.753
They think I'm big brass
over here, you know.

20:07.822 --> 20:10.290
But if you want
my honest opinion, Thomas,

20:10.592 --> 20:13.152
I don't think anybody's
really looking for this kid.

20:15.330 --> 20:17.059
Hey, here they come.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.296
They're early.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.835
Look, be sure and wait
until after I take
the envelope back.

20:21.903 --> 20:23.029
I'm not ready!

20:23.104 --> 20:24.093
You're ready.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.678
You got the money?

20:44.359 --> 20:45.792
Yeah, I got your money.

20:45.894 --> 20:47.919
You know, you guys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves,

20:47.996 --> 20:49.827
taking money
from working people.

20:50.365 --> 20:51.593
Save it for Sunday.

20:54.069 --> 20:55.798
It's $50 short.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.528
I haven't put mine in yet.

20:58.607 --> 21:01.235
You should also watch
how you flash
this kind of money around.

21:01.309 --> 21:02.776
This isn't
the best neighborhood,
you know.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.709
Be a lot safer
if you carry it
in one of these.

21:05.747 --> 21:07.374
What are you doing?

21:07.649 --> 21:08.707
Don't do that.

21:08.783 --> 21:10.045
I'm trying to help you here.

21:10.118 --> 21:12.586
Excuse me. I just bought
this pineapple from you

21:12.654 --> 21:14.519
and I'm afraid
it's kind of rotten.

21:14.589 --> 21:17.353
Gee, I'm sorry, Mister.
I'll get you another one
right away,

21:17.425 --> 21:18.653
just as soon
as you fill in this form.

21:18.727 --> 21:19.751
Oh, no. Do I have to?

21:19.828 --> 21:21.762
I'm kind of running late.
I need to catch a plane.

21:21.830 --> 21:22.922
Give him the pineapple.

21:22.998 --> 21:25.057
You wanna let me run
my own business, pal?

21:25.133 --> 21:26.498
Give him the pineapple.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.437
Thank you.

21:32.907 --> 21:34.374
Now, give me the money back.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.390
He has it.

22:05.774 --> 22:08.334
Look, I don't want
any trouble. Obviously,

22:09.077 --> 22:11.602
it was an error in judgment
on our part,

22:11.680 --> 22:15.377
but as long as you get
the money back, I mean,
no hard feelings, huh?

22:24.426 --> 22:26.860
Mac. Mac!

22:31.833 --> 22:33.232
I can explain.

22:33.635 --> 22:35.227
No, wait, he's...

22:36.738 --> 22:38.831
Freeze. Police.

22:40.008 --> 22:41.873
I'll take that.

22:42.377 --> 22:44.277
Hi, Lieutenant.
What are you doing here?

22:44.345 --> 22:45.744
What am I doing here?

22:45.814 --> 22:47.805
We got an anonymous tip
that these guys

22:47.882 --> 22:50.214
would be making
the collection rounds today.

22:50.285 --> 22:52.014
We've been after them
for months,

22:52.087 --> 22:53.452
and I might have known

22:53.555 --> 22:55.489
you'd be right
in the middle of it.

22:55.690 --> 22:56.918
I can explain, really.

22:56.991 --> 22:57.980
Mmm-hmm.

22:58.593 --> 23:00.288
Take them downtown.

23:02.363 --> 23:03.796
All of them.

23:04.365 --> 23:06.595
<i>I think</i>
<i>we should at least hear</i>
<i>what he has to say.</i>

23:06.868 --> 23:09.530
I don't trust that guy.

23:09.604 --> 23:12.698
Mr. Hasley has
a great number of connections
in Washington.

23:12.774 --> 23:14.833
When I explained to him
about the boy's dilemma,

23:14.909 --> 23:17.139
he seemed quite anxious
to try and help out.

23:17.212 --> 23:19.806
He's using Tran Quoc
as a political ploy.

23:20.381 --> 23:22.849
Well, I suppose
it's a possibility, yes.

23:22.917 --> 23:24.782
T. C: No possibility about it.

23:24.853 --> 23:27.720
Stand the boy
in front of the cameras,
show how concerned I am

23:27.789 --> 23:29.313
about the Amerasian problem.

23:29.390 --> 23:30.823
Hey, we don't need
the guy's help.

23:30.892 --> 23:32.826
He's a politician,
not an investigator.

23:32.894 --> 23:35.294
I don't see
what difference it makes
what he is,

23:35.363 --> 23:37.126
if he can find
the boy's father.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.495
Hi, guys.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.866
You asked us
to meet you here
two hours ago.

23:41.936 --> 23:42.960
Where have you been?

23:43.037 --> 23:46.097
Oh, I got a little tied up
with Lieutenant Tanaka
on another case.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.163
Honestly, Magnum.

23:47.242 --> 23:48.539
I got a list
of all the Joneses

23:48.610 --> 23:50.908
who mustered out in Hawaii.
It's long.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.512
You see? I told you
Thomas would come through.

23:54.582 --> 23:57.483
I figure we've just got to
divide the list up,
and track this guy down.

23:57.552 --> 23:59.452
Geez, that could take months.

23:59.921 --> 24:03.049
Okay, maybe we should
let him talk to Hasley,

24:03.191 --> 24:04.749
but I'm gonna be there
to make sure

24:04.826 --> 24:06.555
he doesn't shove the kid
in front of any cameras.

24:06.628 --> 24:08.289
Would you
look this way?
- Over here.

24:08.363 --> 24:09.990
Mr. Hasley,
could you give us
a statement, sir?

24:10.064 --> 24:12.055
Is it true
you're going to look
for the boy's father?

24:12.133 --> 24:13.464
I want
to thank you all
for coming out today,

24:13.535 --> 24:15.969
but this is a personal event,
not a public one. Okay?

24:16.037 --> 24:17.800
I appreciate your giving us
a little space.

24:17.872 --> 24:19.032
Mr. Hasley...
Mr. Hasley...

24:19.107 --> 24:21.268
Mr. Hasley,
Tran Quoc Jones.

24:23.912 --> 24:26.073
Looks like
you're quite a celebrity, son.

24:27.282 --> 24:29.273
You know, not everyone
has your courage

24:29.350 --> 24:31.477
to come all this way
looking for your father.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.312
Well, I'll say one thing
for the guy,

24:34.389 --> 24:37.324
he always knew
how to keep his face
in front of the people.

24:39.427 --> 24:42.157
He just better not
get Tran Quoc's hopes up,
that's all.

24:47.202 --> 24:48.464
What?

24:49.404 --> 24:50.769
I don't know, nothing.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.635
Where did Hasley go?

25:00.782 --> 25:03.250
Get a picture
of that guy.
Get over there.

25:16.163 --> 25:17.562
You all right?

25:17.631 --> 25:20.361
I think so. I'm fine.

25:21.468 --> 25:22.594
Where's Tran Quoc?

25:22.669 --> 25:24.000
I don't know
where they came from.

25:24.071 --> 25:25.129
Where's the boy?

25:25.205 --> 25:26.695
I didn't see anything,

25:26.773 --> 25:28.536
just heard the shots.

25:29.009 --> 25:30.340
I feel so foolish.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.105
Where's the boy?

25:35.082 --> 25:36.640
Mr. Hasley, did you see
who fired the shots?

25:36.716 --> 25:37.774
Mr. Hasley, are you all right?

25:37.851 --> 25:39.148
A statement,
please, Mr. Hasley.

26:03.276 --> 26:04.971
T. C: It's okay.
They're gone.

26:31.471 --> 26:32.460
You know,

26:33.373 --> 26:35.933
when I was a kid,
I used to be
scared of the dark.

26:37.711 --> 26:40.976
I used to think
that there were monsters
up under my bed,

26:42.215 --> 26:43.978
so you know what?

26:45.218 --> 26:46.651
I started talking to them,

26:49.956 --> 26:51.583
trying to get them to go away.

26:53.827 --> 26:56.796
You know something? They did.

27:08.074 --> 27:10.133
After the Americans left,

27:10.944 --> 27:13.435
my mother took me
to live with her family.

27:14.080 --> 27:15.240
We hid away.

27:17.184 --> 27:20.984
One day some men came
and took her away.

27:23.590 --> 27:26.684
I heard shooting
and I ran after her,

27:30.263 --> 27:32.390
but they killed her.

27:35.735 --> 27:39.068
They killed her because
she had married my father.

27:40.540 --> 27:45.000
They said that she was working
for the Americans,

27:45.879 --> 27:47.904
and that she was a spy.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.549
I wish I could undo that
for you.

27:56.323 --> 27:57.551
I thought

27:59.326 --> 28:01.351
if I came to America,

28:02.996 --> 28:06.397
all these bad thoughts
would go away.

28:08.235 --> 28:10.032
Now I think

28:10.170 --> 28:12.900
maybe they never will.

28:14.841 --> 28:16.240
Well, maybe they won't,

28:18.211 --> 28:20.771
but you won't think
about them all the time.

28:22.048 --> 28:25.506
I hardly ever think
of the scary times
back there anymore.

28:27.387 --> 28:29.252
But when it gets really bad,

28:30.957 --> 28:32.219
I think,

28:33.193 --> 28:35.388
"I made it through that,
didn't I?"

28:36.429 --> 28:38.397
Well, I can make it
through anything.

28:42.802 --> 28:43.996
Come on.

28:49.309 --> 28:52.244
T.C.,
what if Magnum
doesn't find my father?

28:52.345 --> 28:53.869
He'll find him.

28:54.114 --> 28:55.411
You okay?

28:56.016 --> 28:57.005
Yeah.

28:57.617 --> 28:59.175
Did you see anybody?

29:00.120 --> 29:03.146
To get in and out
without a trace, the guy
had to be a real pro.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.785
So why'd he miss?

29:06.359 --> 29:07.951
That's what
I'd like to know.

29:09.029 --> 29:10.291
What are you saying?

29:10.363 --> 29:12.126
You're telling me
you can't stop people

29:12.198 --> 29:13.688
from taking potshots
at your guests?

29:13.767 --> 29:16.235
That is most certainly
not what I am saying.

29:16.303 --> 29:20.205
Naturally, the beaches are
more open and vulnerable
than the rest of the estate.

29:20.273 --> 29:22.935
However, I will
personally see to it
that efforts are redoubled

29:23.009 --> 29:26.968
to insure against
any recurrence of today's
most distressing events.

29:27.047 --> 29:28.514
I don't think
you have to bother.

29:28.581 --> 29:32.278
You can tell Mr. Robin Masters
that we'll hold
our fundraiser elsewhere.

29:32.352 --> 29:34.877
Let's bring the cars around.
Let's go.

29:40.927 --> 29:44.624
You were right.
I shouldn't have wandered out
onto that beach today.

29:45.598 --> 29:49.034
I forget there are still
people out there who would
like to see me dead.

29:49.502 --> 29:51.800
Thank God the boy's
still alive.

29:52.472 --> 29:54.269
I'd like to help you
find your father.

29:54.341 --> 29:55.831
T. C: Yeah, well,
we don't want your help.

29:55.909 --> 29:59.310
So far, all you've done is
bring a lot of reporters
around and caused a big stir.

29:59.379 --> 30:01.244
T.C.
- T.C.'s right.

30:01.314 --> 30:04.806
How do we know
this whole shooting thing
wasn't just a publicity stunt?

30:04.884 --> 30:06.852
It was no stunt.

30:06.986 --> 30:09.614
I know a lot of people
still harbor
resentment toward me

30:09.689 --> 30:12.954
about my activities
during the Vietnam War.

30:13.493 --> 30:15.961
They see me walking around
healthy and happy,

30:16.029 --> 30:18.554
and they get angry
because they think
I should have been over there.

30:18.631 --> 30:20.326
Maybe if I had gotten
shot or killed,

30:20.400 --> 30:24.029
their husband or brother
or father
would still be alive today.

30:24.571 --> 30:26.869
I may have made some mistakes
when I was younger,

30:26.940 --> 30:29.670
but I like to think
they were mistakes
of caring too much.

30:29.743 --> 30:32.143
Mistakes of method,
not of ethics.

30:32.212 --> 30:35.773
And the sad fact is,
if more people
had listened to me sooner,

30:35.849 --> 30:38.545
maybe some of those husbands
and brothers and fathers

30:38.618 --> 30:40.643
would still be alive today.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.120
Wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.248
You make
this nice little speech,

30:45.325 --> 30:47.384
full of understanding,
full of compassion,

30:47.460 --> 30:49.360
and then you go right back
to where you started.

30:49.429 --> 30:51.897
"People should have
listened to me. I was right."

30:51.965 --> 30:55.059
Well, don't try to convince us
that you're such
a wonderful person

30:55.135 --> 30:57.763
because you had
the courage to stand up
for what you believe in.

30:57.837 --> 30:59.304
Convince yourself.

30:59.372 --> 31:00.430
Because in my book,

31:00.507 --> 31:02.338
it can't compare
to the kind of courage it took

31:02.409 --> 31:04.172
to go over there
and get shot at.

31:13.486 --> 31:15.454
I'd still like
to help the boy.

31:58.631 --> 32:00.326
<i>Honey Lester</i>
<i>was pretty new to the Island.</i>

32:00.400 --> 32:02.163
She didn't seem
to have any friends,

32:02.235 --> 32:03.566
but she had one encounter
with a guy

32:03.636 --> 32:05.399
that was running girls
on the Avenue.

32:05.472 --> 32:06.962
Now, apparently,
somebody stepped in

32:07.040 --> 32:08.940
and convinced this guy
to leave her alone.

32:09.008 --> 32:11.169
It seems that she has
some pretty heavy connections
somewhere.

32:11.244 --> 32:13.906
Magnum, I just had a call
from Dick Hasley's office.

32:15.081 --> 32:17.242
If it's about what happened
yesterday, Higgins,
I'm sorry.

32:17.317 --> 32:19.217
Maybe I was out of line
with Hasley.

32:19.786 --> 32:22.084
But I've been listening
to these people for years

32:22.155 --> 32:25.022
with their neat little version
of how things were.

32:25.358 --> 32:27.383
It's just not that simple,
Higgins.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.018
It never is.

32:29.095 --> 32:32.656
However, perhaps some good
has come out of our meeting
with Mr. Hasley.

32:32.732 --> 32:36.429
Apparently, the story
about Tran Quoc went out on
the wire services last night.

32:36.503 --> 32:38.630
Oh, great. That means
we're gonna be hearing
from immigration.

32:38.705 --> 32:40.138
Now, what are we
gonna tell them?

32:40.206 --> 32:43.437
We'll just have to tell them
the truth, that we're looking
for the boy's father.

32:43.510 --> 32:45.205
Dick Hasley
has found him.

32:45.278 --> 32:48.338
He's arriving tomorrow morning
on the first plane
from Colorado.

33:08.401 --> 33:10.926
T.Q. Hey, T.Q.

33:12.238 --> 33:14.297
Hey, man, you look great.

33:16.075 --> 33:17.633
Mr. Higgins gave it to me.

33:19.679 --> 33:22.580
Well, everybody's waiting.

33:23.516 --> 33:25.177
T.C.
Mmm-hmm.

33:25.251 --> 33:26.912
I've been thinking.

33:28.221 --> 33:29.381
What?

33:31.157 --> 33:34.422
I probably wouldn't really
fit in in Colorado.

33:35.461 --> 33:37.395
I'm used to living
in the streets,

33:37.463 --> 33:39.124
taking care of myself,

33:40.066 --> 33:41.363
you know.

33:41.801 --> 33:43.826
Maybe I'd better
stay here.

33:44.771 --> 33:46.261
I mean,

33:46.773 --> 33:49.333
it's not like
he's really my father.

33:50.276 --> 33:51.675
He left us.

33:52.512 --> 33:54.946
He probably doesn't even
want me around.

33:55.782 --> 33:58.410
Well, he's come
a long way to get you.

33:59.018 --> 34:00.610
I think he wants you around.

34:01.020 --> 34:04.751
Yeah, but
if anything happened,
that he didn't want me...

34:04.824 --> 34:06.724
Hey, hey, hey.
You just call me.

34:10.730 --> 34:13.722
Do you think
I'll ever see you again?

34:13.933 --> 34:15.797
Look, no matter
where you are,

34:16.402 --> 34:18.734
if you need me,
I will be there so quick,

34:18.838 --> 34:21.033
you won't even see me coming.
You got that?

34:29.482 --> 34:30.880
T.C.
Hmm?

34:32.619 --> 34:33.984
Nothing.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.717
We'd better go.

34:35.788 --> 34:36.777
Yeah.

34:45.098 --> 34:46.690
Come on, what do you want
from me, huh?

34:46.766 --> 34:48.495
Proof that he's
the boy's real father.

34:48.568 --> 34:50.661
Surely you can appreciate
our concern.

34:50.737 --> 34:51.829
All right.

34:51.904 --> 34:54.270
Besides the affidavits
from family and friends,

34:54.340 --> 34:57.138
he brought these with him.
They're letters from his wife

34:58.311 --> 35:01.576
before she was convicted
of being an American spy
and killed, okay?

35:02.248 --> 35:04.409
You wanna read them yourself,
be my guest.

35:04.684 --> 35:07.380
They're just full of hopes
and dreams for the future,

35:07.453 --> 35:09.614
news of their infant son,
that's it.

35:10.390 --> 35:13.757
Well, reading
a man's private mail...

35:13.826 --> 35:15.555
Do you think you gentlemen
could hurry this up?

35:15.628 --> 35:17.755
I have a press conference
to go to, okay?

35:19.165 --> 35:20.325
They're here.

35:21.300 --> 35:24.167
So that's when
the other fish came around,

35:24.504 --> 35:27.530
so then, that fish said
to the other fish,

35:27.840 --> 35:31.207
"Just because
the hook was there,
you didn't have to bite it."

35:31.477 --> 35:33.308
Well, I guess
you had to be there.

35:37.383 --> 35:39.943
Tran Quoc,
this is your father.

36:09.348 --> 36:13.045
These are for you, Magnum.
Pencils. You can put
your name on them.

36:13.753 --> 36:15.277
They'll be good for business.

36:19.992 --> 36:21.220
T.C.,

36:22.028 --> 36:23.620
you could give these
to Gloria.

36:30.036 --> 36:32.971
Rick, here, on the house.

36:38.511 --> 36:39.808
And Mr. Higgins.

36:56.462 --> 36:58.794
These are some old pictures
of me

36:58.898 --> 37:00.388
when I was a kid.

37:00.533 --> 37:03.331
You can have them
to remember me.

37:04.137 --> 37:05.126
Hey,

37:05.872 --> 37:08.102
you don't want
to give these away.

37:08.741 --> 37:11.835
It's okay.
I don't need them anymore.

37:29.529 --> 37:30.860
Thank you.

37:33.266 --> 37:34.597
Gentlemen.

37:43.442 --> 37:44.568
Well,

37:46.279 --> 37:49.077
I believe I should take
the advice on this T-shirt

37:49.148 --> 37:51.139
and fix myself
something cool to drink.

37:52.485 --> 37:54.112
May I offer you lads
something?

37:54.887 --> 37:57.822
No, thank you.
I have some business in town

37:57.890 --> 38:00.051
that I haven't had time
to take care of.

38:00.660 --> 38:01.649
Where are you going?

38:01.727 --> 38:03.718
To see a man
about a pineapple.

38:12.638 --> 38:16.130
Magnum, am I glad to see you!
I was just calling you.

38:16.209 --> 38:17.574
No, no, no, no.

38:18.044 --> 38:19.534
You weren't just calling me.

38:20.146 --> 38:21.738
You aren't glad to see me.

38:21.814 --> 38:23.941
You hung me out to dry
with those guys

38:24.016 --> 38:25.506
and then you took off
with all the money!

38:25.585 --> 38:26.574
Pretty good, huh?

38:26.652 --> 38:27.812
No, it wasn't good.

38:27.887 --> 38:29.878
It was a rotten thing to do
and you're...

38:29.956 --> 38:31.423
You're going to give back
all that money.

38:31.490 --> 38:33.720
I already did.
And I'm going to go with you
to make...

38:34.393 --> 38:35.792
Every penny.

38:38.064 --> 38:39.759
I don't believe you.

38:40.066 --> 38:43.593
Well, except
for my recovery fee,
10%% off the top.

38:43.803 --> 38:47.364
But, you see, I figured
these guys wouldn't fall
for a simple switch scam.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.341
No, no. Uh-uh.
You wouldn't give it back.

38:50.409 --> 38:53.640
Not for 10%%, uh-uh.
No way. Not you.

38:53.713 --> 38:57.672
All right, all right,
so it was a 20%% fee. But you
got to figure it this way.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.344
These people have been paying
100%% for years.

39:00.419 --> 39:01.943
Now that these guys
are in jail,

39:02.021 --> 39:04.114
they don't have
to pay anything.
You had no way
of knowing

39:04.190 --> 39:05.987
they were gonna
get arrested.

39:06.058 --> 39:07.787
Well, who do you think
called the police?

39:09.562 --> 39:12.861
Let's face it, Magnum.
I performed a service
for my fellow craftsmen.

39:13.299 --> 39:16.200
We did. You should be
very proud of yourself.

39:18.471 --> 39:21.531
No, I'm not proud.
Leave me out of it.

39:21.774 --> 39:24.106
I figured
you'd still be mad at me.

39:26.012 --> 39:28.446
Mad? Mad?

39:31.250 --> 39:33.343
Mad doesn't even come close.

39:33.686 --> 39:36.280
Well,
that's one of the reasons
I tried to call you.

39:36.355 --> 39:38.789
Well, consider
the message delivered,

39:38.858 --> 39:41.656
and don't ever call me again!

39:44.497 --> 39:47.398
The other reason I tried
to call you is to tell you
that I went back to NIA

39:47.466 --> 39:50.264
and found out the information
you were trying to get
on the kid's father.

39:50.336 --> 39:51.963
Well, I'm afraid
you're a little late.

39:52.038 --> 39:53.665
He picked Tran Quoc up
this afternoon.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.230
That's impossible.
He was killed in action
in Vietnam.

40:08.343 --> 40:10.504
If the lad's father
was killed in action,

40:10.538 --> 40:12.733
then who drove out of here
with him, and why?

40:12.807 --> 40:15.708
Well, whoever he was,
he was working for Hasley.

40:15.776 --> 40:18.677
Here's the stuff
from the envelope
that T.Q. Gave me.

40:18.746 --> 40:21.214
An appointment book
belonging to...

40:21.282 --> 40:22.306
Honey Lester.

40:22.383 --> 40:24.647
Yeah, and also,
here's the yellow pages ad

40:24.719 --> 40:26.949
that he used to find you
in the first place.

40:27.788 --> 40:29.847
And here are at least
half-a-dozen papers

40:29.924 --> 40:32.358
linking Hasley
to organized crime.

40:34.362 --> 40:35.590
My God.

40:37.431 --> 40:39.956
You think Hasley knew
the kid had those papers?

40:40.034 --> 40:42.867
He must have. He and Redfield.

40:43.137 --> 40:44.468
Man, they really took us in.

40:44.538 --> 40:46.403
I shall go down to
his headquarters immediately

40:46.474 --> 40:48.601
and demand that he give us
the whereabouts of the boy.

40:48.676 --> 40:50.234
Oh, and you think
they'll just tell us?

40:50.311 --> 40:52.472
They will if they want
these papers back.

40:54.749 --> 40:56.717
If they were willing
to kill somebody for them,

40:56.784 --> 40:58.183
they should be willing
to make a trade.

40:58.252 --> 40:59.617
Robin Masters' estate.

41:00.888 --> 41:02.082
It's Tran Quoc.

41:05.059 --> 41:07.926
T. C: Do you think
they're really
gonna just let him go?

41:07.995 --> 41:11.487
I don't think they're gonna
risk shooting him or us
in front of witnesses.

41:14.735 --> 41:16.635
Well, here they come.

41:17.238 --> 41:18.500
T. C?

41:19.440 --> 41:20.702
I'm okay.

41:43.898 --> 41:46.059
How do we know
you'll leave the boy alone?

41:46.133 --> 41:47.600
'Cause I gave you
my word.

41:48.536 --> 41:50.231
The papers for the kid,

41:50.304 --> 41:51.703
and he's free to go with you.

41:51.772 --> 41:54.570
Until you decide to take shots
at him on the beach again?

41:54.642 --> 41:56.439
No, we weren't shooting
at the kid.

41:56.510 --> 41:58.978
It was Hasley we needed
to get the message to.

41:59.046 --> 42:00.570
Boy means nothing to us.

42:06.420 --> 42:08.445
How did you even know
he had the papers?

42:09.156 --> 42:10.384
The girl told me.

42:11.258 --> 42:13.852
It's amazing
what people will say
when they're scared.

42:17.064 --> 42:19.089
I'm sorry I lied to you

42:19.767 --> 42:21.632
about my father.

42:21.702 --> 42:23.966
I thought
if I didn't tell anybody

42:24.038 --> 42:25.938
my real father was dead,

42:26.974 --> 42:29.841
maybe somebody would think
I was their son.

42:32.513 --> 42:35.346
I thought he was really going
to take me to Colorado.

42:36.517 --> 42:38.917
After they let us go,

42:39.386 --> 42:41.684
I won't cause you
any more trouble.

42:45.526 --> 42:47.460
You haven't caused us
any trouble.

42:48.395 --> 42:50.761
So long, kid,
and welcome to America.

42:53.567 --> 42:54.693
T. C!

43:03.711 --> 43:04.939
Give me that.
Magnum!

43:06.647 --> 43:09.275
You just made
a very serious mistake.

43:09.350 --> 43:11.181
It isn't worth it.
Let's get out of here.

43:11.252 --> 43:12.742
You got lucky, Mister.

43:16.524 --> 43:17.582
Did you get it?

43:18.826 --> 43:22.091
Next time,
you be the halfback
and I'll be the linebacker.

43:22.830 --> 43:24.127
I got it.

43:24.665 --> 43:26.030
A switch.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.931
Where did you learn that?

43:28.002 --> 43:30.061
From a sort of a friend.

43:30.371 --> 43:32.771
I guess you'd better
get these back to Higgins.

43:33.474 --> 43:35.874
And then, are you going
to find my real family?

43:35.943 --> 43:37.911
We're sure gonna try, kid.

43:37.978 --> 43:40.378
You got American aunts
and uncles somewhere.

43:41.081 --> 43:42.776
We'll find them.

43:45.619 --> 43:47.610
I thought
I was doing the kid a favor,
all right?

43:47.688 --> 43:48.746
Indeed.

43:48.823 --> 43:50.882
I thought the guy
was the kid's father.

43:50.958 --> 43:53.119
His papers,
they were very convincing.

43:53.194 --> 43:55.287
Papers
which only you read.

43:55.796 --> 43:58.162
So, you're saying
that I'm working for them?

43:58.232 --> 44:01.326
You come in here
with false accusations
about callgirls,

44:01.402 --> 44:03.427
hoods, politicians gone bad.

44:03.571 --> 44:05.539
This is all very dramatic,
gentlemen,

44:05.606 --> 44:06.630
but you got no proof.

44:06.707 --> 44:07.799
Yes, we do.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.172
They went for it.

44:12.913 --> 44:15.347
I'm quite certain,
in light of these documents,

44:15.416 --> 44:19.284
Mr. Masters will want
to reevaluate his support
of your campaign.

44:19.353 --> 44:21.253
That is, unless
you can give us some proof

44:21.322 --> 44:23.153
that these accusations
are false.

44:23.224 --> 44:25.158
We'll say the documents
are forgeries.

44:25.226 --> 44:26.625
You can't prove otherwise.

44:26.694 --> 44:29.720
This is gonna
follow you around, Hasley.
It's not gonna go away.

44:29.797 --> 44:32.197
Mr. Redfield, the reporters
are getting anxious.

44:32.266 --> 44:33.358
Dick.

44:33.434 --> 44:34.901
Give me
five minutes, Kathy.

44:34.969 --> 44:36.231
Yes, sir.

44:37.771 --> 44:40.399
There was a connection,
but not the one you think.

44:40.474 --> 44:41.600
What are you doing?

44:41.675 --> 44:42.903
They're right.

44:42.977 --> 44:45.275
If they don't dig this up,
someone else will.

44:45.779 --> 44:49.374
It's an old story.
It's corny, like the movies.

44:49.783 --> 44:53.184
Mobsters hire pretty callgirl
to get next to naive,

44:53.254 --> 44:55.347
but basically
honest politician.

44:55.422 --> 44:58.914
She shows him some documents
designed to scare him
into playing ball with them.

44:58.993 --> 45:00.585
Why didn't you go
to the police?

45:00.661 --> 45:02.822
Something happened
that nobody counted on.

45:03.430 --> 45:04.988
Honey and I fell in love.

45:05.833 --> 45:08.563
I couldn't bring myself
to implicate her in all this.

45:08.636 --> 45:11.036
Or maybe you just didn't want
to explain it to your wife.

45:11.572 --> 45:13.597
Maybe I didn't at the time.

45:14.141 --> 45:16.609
Anyway, Honey and I
got arrogant.

45:16.677 --> 45:19.168
We thought we could turn
the tables on those guys.

45:19.413 --> 45:22.871
She managed to get her hands
on records that would expose
the key men

45:22.950 --> 45:25.350
in underworld operations
on the Islands.

45:25.486 --> 45:27.215
Then she got scared,

45:27.288 --> 45:28.880
said we had to hire
some protection

45:28.956 --> 45:31.220
until we could decide
what to do with the documents.

45:31.292 --> 45:33.021
So she called Magnum.

45:33.127 --> 45:35.220
After the police found her,

45:35.763 --> 45:38.163
I went to my wife
with the whole story.

45:38.465 --> 45:40.990
She's gone back to the
mainland to sort things out.

45:41.068 --> 45:43.559
I wanted to spare her at least
the public humiliation

45:43.637 --> 45:45.468
of dragging this out
into the open.

45:47.341 --> 45:51.243
And I kept telling myself,
without the documents
Honey had,

45:51.578 --> 45:54.308
what good would it do
to go to the press?

45:54.515 --> 45:56.312
You have
the documents now.

46:03.023 --> 46:04.251
Dick,

46:04.992 --> 46:06.482
don't be a fool.

46:06.593 --> 46:08.322
You go out there
and talk about this,

46:08.395 --> 46:10.260
you're not gonna stop the mob.

46:10.331 --> 46:12.595
All you're gonna do is wreck
your own political career.

46:12.666 --> 46:14.531
What other choice
do I have?

46:14.601 --> 46:16.899
Not talk about it?
Cover it up?

46:17.171 --> 46:20.038
Run scared from every gangster
and investigative reporter

46:20.107 --> 46:22.166
who wants to make
something out of this?

46:23.077 --> 46:25.136
I haven't changed
that much, Dennis.

46:35.756 --> 46:38.554
You think maybe
we were wrong about that guy?

46:40.127 --> 46:41.560
I don't know.

46:42.196 --> 46:43.857
Where's Tran Quoc?

46:44.031 --> 46:47.558
He's sitting on the front row.
I wanted to make sure
Hasley could see him.

46:49.336 --> 46:51.395
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>
<i>of the press,</i>

46:51.472 --> 46:53.872
<i>it gives me great pleasure</i>
<i>to introduce you</i>

46:53.941 --> 46:55.670
<i>to Mr. Dick Hasley</i>

47:02.316 --> 47:04.511
<i>I'm sorry to have</i>
<i>kept you waiting.</i>

47:04.585 --> 47:06.780
<i>I hope you'll find</i>
<i>what I have to say today</i>

47:06.854 --> 47:08.719
<i>worth the inconvenience.</i>

47:10.958 --> 47:13.688
<i>We, all of us,</i>

47:14.795 --> 47:17.127
<i>have had to find</i>
<i>our own way in life.</i>

47:18.499 --> 47:20.296
<i>We've all had decisions</i>
<i>to make</i>

47:20.367 --> 47:22.198
<i>which were very difficult.</i>

47:24.571 --> 47:26.163
<i>But I believe</i>

47:26.340 --> 47:29.070
<i>when you face life squarely</i>

47:29.309 --> 47:32.540
<i>and take on</i>
<i>the difficult decisions</i>

47:33.247 --> 47:34.942
<i>and the difficult times,</i>

47:35.582 --> 47:39.143
<i>somehow things have a way</i>
<i>of turning out all right.</i>
