WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:06.600
PREVIOUSLY ON "I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.600 --> 00:08.233
OH, MY GOD.
YOUR HAIR.

00:08.233 --> 00:11.233
SKYLAR IS ONE OF MY
TRANSGENDER FRIENDS

00:11.233 --> 00:13.600
WHO ALREADY GOT
THE BOTTOM SURGERY.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.967
SO, DO YOU FEEL
DIFFERENT AT ALL?

00:14.967 --> 00:17.100
I FEEL COMPLETE NOW.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.633
Jeanette: OH, MY GOD.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.267
IS THIS FOOD THAT'S BEEN
EATEN JUST, LIKE, GARBAGE?

00:21.267 --> 00:24.800
Jeanette:
I KNEW THAT JAZZ HAD BEEN DOING
SOME BAD EATING HERE AND THERE,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.533
BUT I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS
EATING AS MUCH AS SHE WAS.

00:27.533 --> 00:30.700
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET
A HOSPITAL TO SAY,

00:30.700 --> 00:33.100
"WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW
A SURGERY AT AGE 17,"

00:33.100 --> 00:37.067
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO LOSE 30 POUNDS.

00:37.067 --> 00:38.500
Greg:
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S FIXABLE?

00:38.500 --> 00:41.167
I'LL TRY, BUT IT'S SO HARD
FOR ME 'CAUSE I JUST LOVE FOOD,

00:41.167 --> 00:44.200
AND, I, LIKE,
I LOVE TO BINGE EAT. I LOVE IT.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.367
JAZZ, YOU CAN'T HAVE
THE PROCEDURE

00:46.367 --> 00:47.700
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.500
**

00:50.500 --> 00:53.567
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

00:53.567 --> 00:55.933
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

00:55.933 --> 00:58.367
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

00:58.367 --> 01:00.933
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.067
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.067
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.533
COME ON, JAZZ!
WHOO!

01:06.533 --> 01:08.967
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:08.967 --> 01:11.133
BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:11.133 --> 01:13.067
I AM JAZZ.

**

01:21.800 --> 01:23.533
Greg: HOME, SWEET HOME.

01:23.533 --> 01:25.167
WELL,
THAT WAS QUITE A TRIP.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.333
YES.
THAT WAS QUITE A TRIP.

01:28.333 --> 01:30.900
IT WAS A DOOZY, AND WE HAVE
A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.067
I GOT YOUR SUITCASE,
JEANETTE.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.433
THERE THEY ARE.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.500
-HELLO.
-WE'RE BACK.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.900
CHILLING, HUH?
-WELCOME HOME.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.067
AW, WE WERE JUST PLANNING
A PARTY FOR TOMORROW.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.600
WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
COMING BACK TODAY.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.500
I WANT TO BE COMFY
WITH YOU GUYS.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.667
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK HOME
FROM VISITING SAN FRANCISCO.

01:46.667 --> 01:50.167
HOWEVER, WE HAD
A VERY INTENSE CONSULTATION

01:50.167 --> 01:51.600
WITH DR. MARCI BOWERS.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600
-SO HOW -- HOW WAS SAN FR--
-HOW -- HOW WAS SAN FRAN --

01:53.600 --> 01:55.267
Jeanette: OH, I LOVE WHEN
YOU GUYS DO THAT.

01:55.267 --> 01:56.667
WE JUST TALKED
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.600
YOU SAID, "HOW WAS
SAN FRANCISCO?" TOGETHER.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.167
HOW WAS SAN FRANCISCO?

02:00.167 --> 02:02.267
BASICALLY, WE THOUGHT THE NEXT
THING WE WERE GOING TO DO

02:02.267 --> 02:04.633
WAS HAVE THE PROCEDURE
DONE, RIGHT?

02:04.633 --> 02:07.633
BUT NOW SHE HAD A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT IDEAS

02:07.633 --> 02:08.867
THAT SHE PRESENTED TO US.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.233
Jazz:
LAST TIME, WHEN I MET WITH HER,

02:10.233 --> 02:12.700
SHE SAID THAT IT WAS JUST
GOING TO BE THE SKIN GRAFT,

02:12.700 --> 02:16.067
BUT NOW SHE THINKS IT'S GOING
TO BE THESE OTHER OPTIONS,

02:16.067 --> 02:18.800
BUT BASICALLY, SHE JUST WANTS
TO GET THE MOST SKIN POSSIBLE

02:18.800 --> 02:22.067
IN ORDER TO GET THIS PROCEDURE
DONE THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.100
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
THROUGH ALL THE IDEAS?

02:24.100 --> 02:25.733
Griffen:
KEEP IT PG, LIKE, 13.

02:25.733 --> 02:28.433
NO MATTER WHAT, I ALWAYS WANT
TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT JAZZ,

02:28.433 --> 02:29.767
BUT IT'S PRETTY ODD

02:29.767 --> 02:31.733
TO BE TALKING TO OUR
LITTLE SISTER ALL THE TIME

02:31.733 --> 02:33.600
ABOUT PENISES
AND VAGINAS.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.333
THE FIRST OPTION WAS TO USE
A TESTOSTERONE CREAM

02:37.333 --> 02:40.167
WHERE I WOULD PUT IT
ON MY GENITALS,

02:40.167 --> 02:41.667
AND HOPEFULLY,
THAT WOULD STIMULATE

02:41.667 --> 02:44.100
SOME SORT OF GROWTH
IN THAT AREA.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.100
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT EXISTED.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.933
IF YOU GET IT, YOU BETTER
HIDE IT FROM GRIFFEN.

02:47.933 --> 02:50.300
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT USING THAT.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.433
WHERE DO YOU NEED TO USE IT?
DOWN BELOW?

02:52.433 --> 02:54.067
-OH. OKAY.
-I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. HEY.

02:54.067 --> 02:57.767
I AM MORE THAN SATISFIED
WITH, UH, WHAT I GOT.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.233
Jazz: ALL RIGHT, OPTION TWO

02:59.233 --> 03:02.467
IS THIS NEW,
UP-AND-COMING PROCEDURE.

03:02.467 --> 03:05.233
BASICALLY, YOU TAKE
THE PERITONEAL LINING

03:05.233 --> 03:06.567
FROM THE STOMACH.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.567
IT'S SLIPPERY,
PRODUCES MUCOSA,

03:09.567 --> 03:11.067
SEEMS TO BE -- YEAH.
-IT'S A GREAT OPTION.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.233
-THAT SEEMS
TO BE A GREAT OPTION.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.567
-MUCUS.
-SO IT'S SLIPPERY.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.200
OPTION THREE?

03:16.200 --> 03:18.533
OPTION THREE, IT'S CALLED
A TISSUE EXPANDER,

03:18.533 --> 03:21.433
AND THEY WOULD STICK
THIS LITTLE BALLOON THING

03:21.433 --> 03:24.800
FILLED WITH, LIKE,
A SALINE SOLUTION IN MY SCROTUM,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.267
AND IT WOULD CAUSE
MY SKIN TO STRETCH,

03:27.267 --> 03:30.067
AND I WOULD HAVE TO
KEEP IT FOR 3 TO 6 MONTHS.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.767
IF SOMEONE PUT A BALLOON
IN MY PELVIC AREA,

03:32.767 --> 03:34.800
START BLOWING IT UP,
LIKE, I WOULDN'T BE HAPPY.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.933
I WOULD BE IN A LOT OF PAIN,
AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WALK.

03:37.933 --> 03:40.267
I DON'T THINK JAZZ WANTS
TO GO THROUGH THAT.

03:40.267 --> 03:43.333
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
REALLY BIG, AS WELL.

03:43.333 --> 03:48.400
I HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS
BEFORE I COULD GET THE SURGERY.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.700
-YES.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.067
OF COURSE I WANT A VAGINA.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.067
HEY, AT LEAST SOMETHING'S
GONNA MOTIVATE YOU.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.067
Griffen:
WE HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES

03:56.067 --> 03:57.733
TO HELP JAZZ LOSE WEIGHT
IN THE PAST.

03:57.733 --> 03:59.800
LET'S GO.
PUSH YOURSELF.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.500
DOWN. UP.
THERE WE GO.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.967
YEAH.
YOU FEELING THE BURN NOW.

04:02.967 --> 04:05.233
BUT JAZZ ALWAYS SEEMS
TO GAIN THE WEIGHT BACK.

04:05.233 --> 04:08.100
YOU DO THESE WEEK OR TWO-WEEK
SPANS WHERE YOU EAT WELL

04:08.100 --> 04:10.333
AND MAYBE WORK OUT A LITTLE BIT,
AND YOU LOSE SOME WEIGHT,

04:10.333 --> 04:11.667
AND THEN YOU PUT IT
RIGHT BACK ON THE NEXT WEEK,

04:11.667 --> 04:13.133
AND THAT MAKES
NO SENSE TO ME.

04:13.133 --> 04:15.867
LISTEN, DON'T SHUT ME DOWN
BEFORE I'VE EVEN TRIED.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.567
YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE,
KIND OF PUTTING ME DOWN.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.967
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

04:19.967 --> 04:22.400
IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS YOU

04:22.400 --> 04:23.967
YOU HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT,

04:23.967 --> 04:26.700
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT'S FROM YOUR BROTHER.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.167
I NEED TO FOCUS ON THE WEIGHT.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.100
THAT'S SOMETHING PERSONAL,
AND YOU GUYS GOT TO HELP ME.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.433
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY,
JUST LIKE THE SURGERY'S
NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

04:35.633 --> 04:43.800
**

04:43.800 --> 04:45.833
I'M ABOUT TO GO FOR A BIKE RIDE.
YOU WANT TO JOIN?

04:45.833 --> 04:47.800
UM, SURE.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.433
GOOD.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.133
JUST GIVE ME MY SHOES.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.467
ARE THESE YOURS?
YEAH.

04:52.467 --> 04:53.633
THESE ARE KIND OF UGLY,
NO OFFENSE.

04:53.633 --> 04:54.767
WHATEVER!

04:54.767 --> 04:57.067
Jazz: IT'S PROBABLY BEEN
ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO

04:57.067 --> 04:59.300
SINCE I'VE LAST RODE A BIKE,

04:59.300 --> 05:00.667
AND THAT JUST PROVES

05:00.667 --> 05:04.267
HOW LITTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
I'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN.

05:04.267 --> 05:05.733
OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD.

05:05.733 --> 05:08.067
HOLY MOLY.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.433
UH...

05:09.433 --> 05:11.200
LET'S GET
THIS ONE DOWN FIRST.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.100
I APPRECIATE THAT SANDER
WANTS TO HELP ME WORK OUT.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.767
HOWEVER, I DON'T BELIEVE
HE'S VERY PREPARED

05:16.767 --> 05:18.100
FOR THIS BIKE RIDE.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.833
THAT DOES NOT
HAVE AIR IN IT.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.333
Jazz: SANDER, IT'S FLAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:24.333 --> 05:26.067
YEA, BUT THAT WILL MAKE IT A
MORE DIFFICULT WORKOUT FOR YOU.

05:26.067 --> 05:27.067
NO!

05:27.067 --> 05:28.300
Saner:
I'M TAKING JAZZ BIKE RIDING

05:28.300 --> 05:30.067
BECAUSE I WANT TO TRY
TO HELP MOTIVATE HER

05:30.067 --> 05:31.267
TO BURN CALORIES

05:31.267 --> 05:33.667
AND FIND SOMETHING
THAT MAYBE SHE ENJOYS DOING.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.233
YOU SUCK
AT BIKE-RIDING, THOUGH.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.100
YEAH. I CAN'T RIDE A BIKE
IN A STRAIGHT DIRECTION,

05:37.100 --> 05:39.667
BUT IF IT'S TO HELP JAZZ,
I'LL DO IT.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.067
IS THERE A WAY
TO FIX THESE HANDLEBARS?

05:41.067 --> 05:42.500
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE MESSED UP.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.300
SANDER, THEY'RE TURNED
THE WRONG WAY.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.267
LET GO.
LET GO.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.567
OH, MY GOD.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.667
OH, MY GOD.
YOU FOOL.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.867
OH, THAT MAKES SENSE WHY
I COULDN'T REACH THE HANDLEBARS.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.833
I KNEW HE WAS A DITZ,
END OF STORY.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.533
I KNEW HE WAS A DITZ.

05:57.533 --> 06:00.100
LOOK.
WHOO!

06:03.133 --> 06:06.167
OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE FASTER
THAN ME, HUH?

06:06.167 --> 06:08.700
IF YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE
THE BEST OF YOUR WORKOUT,

06:08.700 --> 06:11.267
YOU GO SLOW, THEN FAST,
SLOW, THEN FAST,

06:11.267 --> 06:12.933
SO PUSH YOURSELF A LITTLE,
AND THEN SLOW DOWN.

06:12.933 --> 06:14.633
MAKE YOURSELF TIRED,
THEN SLOW BACK DOWN.

06:14.633 --> 06:15.733
THAT'S FUN FOR YOU,
NOT ME.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.333
NO.
IT'S HOW YOU LOSE WEIGHT.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.200
YOU SHOULD RIDE
A BIKE EVERY DAY,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.500
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IF YOU
DO THAT TISSUE EXPANDER,

06:21.500 --> 06:23.467
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO RIDE A BIKE FOR A WHILE.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.233
THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

06:25.233 --> 06:27.500
IF I'M GOING TO BE ABLE
TO WORK OUT LIKE THIS.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.933
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO BE
IN BED ALL DAY,

06:28.933 --> 06:30.667
AND THAT'S GOING
TO CAUSE ME

06:30.667 --> 06:34.400
TO GET LAZY
AND POTENTIALLY DEPRESSED.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.733
LIKE, YES,
IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER,

06:35.733 --> 06:38.533
BUT, LIKE, EVERYONE
HAS TO OVERCOME ADVERSITY.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.300
WHENEVER SOMETHING
BAD HAPPENS IN A GAME,

06:40.300 --> 06:42.100
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK
AND TRY TO SCORE BACK.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.133
IT'S THE SAME THING.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.400
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

06:44.400 --> 06:46.333
BECAUSE THAT'S,
LIKE, COMPETITION.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.433
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT,
BUT IT'S --

06:47.433 --> 06:48.633
EVERYTHING SHOULD
BE A COMPETITION.

06:48.633 --> 06:49.867
ARE YOU KIDDING?

06:49.867 --> 06:51.867
THAT'S NOT HOW EVERYONE'S
MIND WORKS, SANDER.

06:51.867 --> 06:54.933
Jazz:
SANDER ADVISES THAT I APPROACH
MY WEIGHT ISSUE

06:54.933 --> 06:56.233
LIKE A COMPETITION,

06:56.233 --> 06:58.667
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

06:58.667 --> 07:01.800
THIS IS ABOUT ME TRYING TO
OVERCOME MY WILLPOWER ISSUES,

07:01.800 --> 07:03.833
AND I STILL NEED HELP WITH THAT.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.933
Jazz:
YOU'RE A GOOD BIG BROTHER,
BUT I LOVE GRIFFEN MORE.

07:06.933 --> 07:08.700
THAT'S FALSE.
I KNOW YOU LIKE ME MORE.

07:09.833 --> 07:17.267
**

07:21.733 --> 07:23.833
Jazz: COME IN!

07:23.833 --> 07:25.300
-HEY.
-HELLO.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.967
TONIGHT, JAY AND NOELLE
ARE COMING TO HANG OUT.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:29.567 --> 07:31.867
I'M GETTING INGREDIENTS
FOR THE SMOOTHIE.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.967
USUALLY, WHEN I HAVE
FRIENDS OVER,

07:33.967 --> 07:36.067
WE'LL ORDER IN SOME CRAPPY FOOD

07:36.067 --> 07:38.933
OR WE FIND SOME YUMMY THINGS
IN THE PANTRY.

07:38.933 --> 07:41.200
HOWEVER, NOW THAT
I HAVE TO BE HEALTHY,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.067
IT'S BACK TO SMOOTHIES
AND VEGETABLES

07:43.067 --> 07:44.500
AND EVERYTHING DISGUSTING.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.567
UGH!
I'M GOING TO DIE.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.933
CAN'T YOU GUYS TELL
I'M A RATCHET SMOOTHIE MAKER?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.167
Jayleen: YEP.

07:50.167 --> 07:51.767
Noelle: WHY ARE YOU EATING
SO HEALTHY ANYWAYS?

07:51.767 --> 07:55.500
WELL, YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW I WENT TO SAN FRANCISCO

07:55.500 --> 07:57.833
TO VISIT MY SURGEON,
DR. MARCI BOWERS?

07:57.833 --> 07:58.900
-YEAH.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.067
UM, IT WENT OKAY.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.300
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS
WE TALKED ABOUT

08:03.300 --> 08:06.800
IS THAT MY BMI
MIGHT BE TOO HIGH

08:06.800 --> 08:08.767
TO GET
THE PROCEDURE DONE, AND --

08:08.767 --> 08:11.067
THAT'S A THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

08:11.067 --> 08:15.933
IT'S A THING, I GUESS,
AND I HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS

08:15.933 --> 08:19.700
BEFORE I'M, LIKE, A CANDIDATE
WITH THE GUIDELINES.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.267
SO...
THAT'S CRAZY.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.200
AND I'M TAKING IT REALLY
SERIOUSLY, AS YOU CAN SEE.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.133
YEAH.
THUS, THE SMOOTHIES.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.067
HEARING THAT JAZZ'S BMI
IS TOO HIGH

08:27.067 --> 08:29.233
IS A LITTLE SURPRISING TO ME,

08:29.233 --> 08:30.567
BUT IT'S ALSO A LITTLE SCARY

08:30.567 --> 08:33.533
BECAUSE THAT ADDS A WHOLE
NEW SENSE OF PRESSURE

08:33.533 --> 08:35.633
TO AN ALREADY
DIFFICULT EQUATION.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.900
I FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY
COMMITTED THIS TIME

08:37.900 --> 08:39.300
AND THAT I'M GOING
TO LOSE THE WEIGHT.

08:39.300 --> 08:43.700
MY ONLY WORRY IS THAT I KNOW
HOW WEAK MY WILLPOWER IS.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.533
I FEEL LIKE, TO HELP
MY EATING PROBLEM,

08:46.533 --> 08:49.733
I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE
GO TO, LIKE, A HYPNOTIST.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.067
HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD
OF THAT OR NO?

08:51.067 --> 08:52.500
WHAT?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.867
I'VE HEARD OF POSITIVE
EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER PEOPLE

08:55.867 --> 08:58.500
WHEN IT COMES TO SMOKING
AND LETTING GO OF CIGARETTES

08:58.500 --> 09:00.133
AND ALSO DIETING,

09:00.133 --> 09:04.067
SO THE IDEA TO GO TO A HYPNOTIST
IS VERY, VERY INTERESTING.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.933
WHAT DO THEY DO? LIKE,
"DON'T EAT FRENCH FRIES"?

09:05.933 --> 09:07.200
"DON'T EAT CHEESEBURGERS"?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.800
THEY'RE LIKE,
"NO MORE FRENCH FRIES FOR YOU."

09:10.133 --> 09:12.233
LIKE, I KNOW IT'S WORKED
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

09:12.233 --> 09:14.500
LIKE, WITH ALL
DIFFERENT TYPES OF HABITS.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.867
TRY IT AT LEAST BECAUSE THERE'S
NOT GOING TO BE A DOWNSIDE.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.300
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
GOING TO HYPNOTIZE YOU,

09:19.300 --> 09:21.200
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO EXCLUSIVELY EAT BACON,

09:21.200 --> 09:22.967
LIKE, FOR EVERY MEAL
EVERY DAY.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.833
LIKE, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.433
I FEEL LIKE I NEED SOME SORT
OF MIRACLE RIGHT NOW,

09:27.433 --> 09:31.767
AND HYPNOTHERAPY SEEMS TO BE,
LIKE, SOME MYSTERIOUS MIRACLE.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.767
BODY MASS INDEX.
IN ORDER WORDS, SHE'S TOO FAT.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.600
I REALLY NEED TO FIX
THIS PROBLEM

09:38.600 --> 09:40.067
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

09:40.067 --> 09:43.767
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IS
INSTRUCTING YOU TO EAT SLOWER.

09:46.767 --> 09:53.433
**

09:53.433 --> 09:56.233
Greg:
I HAVE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

09:56.233 --> 09:59.167
I'VE FIGURED OUT WHERE WE'RE
GOING ON OUR FAMILY VACATION.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.433
**

10:01.433 --> 10:02.900
GRAND CANYON!

10:02.900 --> 10:04.967
WAIT. REALLY?
YEAH.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.800
OUR FAMILY LOVES TO TRAVEL.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.433
THE KIDS ARE GETTING OLDER.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.033
THE TRIPS ARE GOING TO BE
FAR AND FEW BETWEEN,

10:11.033 --> 10:13.967
AND SO WE TRY TO MAKE
THE MOST OF THIS OPPORTUNITY

10:13.967 --> 10:15.767
TO SPEND TIME
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.200
DID MOM PLAN IT?
DID YOU PLAN IT?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.333
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.167
ME AND MOM HAD TALKED
ABOUT IT QUIETLY.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.533
WE CHOSE THE GRAND CANYON

10:21.533 --> 10:22.967
BECAUSE THE BRADY BUNCH
WENT THERE,

10:22.967 --> 10:25.933
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
AN AWFULLY COOL PLACE TO GO.

10:25.933 --> 10:29.833
BUT CINDY GOT LOST,
SO THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.133
"CINDY!"

10:32.600 --> 10:33.933
ARE WE STAYING IN, LIKE,
SOME WEIRD CABIN...

10:33.933 --> 10:34.933
Greg: TENTS.
...OR ARE WE GONNA STAY

10:34.933 --> 10:35.933
IN A RESORT?

10:35.933 --> 10:37.967
TENT?
I'M NOT STAYING IN A TENT.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.333
OH.
OKAY.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.900
THEN MAYBE I'LL HAVE TO RETHINK
THAT PART OF THE TRIP.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.533
-YEAH.

10:43.533 --> 10:46.600
Jazz: BUT, ANYWAY, DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO HEAR THE GOOD NEWS?

10:46.600 --> 10:49.100
I'VE BEEN EATING SO CLEAN,
NOT CHEATING AT ALL,

10:49.100 --> 10:50.733
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT
EVERY SINGLE DAY, SO...

10:50.733 --> 10:53.833
-I HAD A SALAD.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.367
-A SALAD.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.700
NO. I HAD A SALAD WITH CHICKEN
AND VEGETABLES.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.100
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT
I'LL HAVE A TEMPTATION,

11:02.100 --> 11:04.467
AND THEN I'LL SEE THE FOOD,
AND THEN I'LL BREAK THE DIET,

11:04.467 --> 11:08.067
AND THEN I'LL GO DOWN THAT
RABBIT HOLE OF FATNESS AGAIN.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.600
I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE, LIKE,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.533
I COULD VISIT A HYPNOTIST
OR SOMETHING

11:11.533 --> 11:15.700
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WORK TO HELP
YOU GET OVER THOSE ADDICTIONS.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.233
YOU DON'T GO
TO A HYPNOTIST.

11:17.233 --> 11:18.900
YOU GO
TO A HYPNOTHERAPIST.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.167
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.433
Jeanette: I KNOW THAT JAZZ HATES
TRADITIONAL THERAPY,

11:22.433 --> 11:25.367
SO I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
SHE WANTS TO TRY HYPNOTHERAPY.

11:25.367 --> 11:27.867
IF SHE COULD HAVE A LITTLE
EXTRA PUSH BEHIND HER,

11:27.867 --> 11:30.133
A LITTLE WIND BENEATH
HER WINGS, SO TO SPEAK,

11:30.133 --> 11:32.267
I THINK
IT COULD BE EFFECTIVE.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.400
WE HAVE ONE MORE THING
TO DISCUSS.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.633
WE GOT A CALL FROM THIS
PRODUCER FROM THE RADIO,

11:37.633 --> 11:41.267
AND THEY HAVE A SHOW
THAT THEY WANT US TO GO ON,

11:41.267 --> 11:43.067
AND THEY'RE GOING TO
BRING ON A SCIENTIST

11:43.067 --> 11:45.633
THAT HAS A BELIEF
THAT IT'S BEST

11:45.633 --> 11:48.100
NOT TO GO ON HORMONES
UNTIL AFTER PUBERTY

11:48.100 --> 11:51.667
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT
80 PERCENT OF THE KIDS

11:51.667 --> 11:53.933
ARE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.167
RECENTLY, JAZZ AND I HAVE BEEN
INVITED TO BE ON A PANEL

11:57.167 --> 12:01.467
AS PART OF A PODCAST
TO DEBATE WITH A SCIENTIST

12:01.467 --> 12:04.600
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ALLOWING
KIDS TO GO ON HORMONES

12:04.600 --> 12:07.600
AND THINKS THAT THEY'LL
GROW OUT OF IT COME PUBERTY.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.267
OF COURSE, I KNOW
THAT IT'S LIFE-SAVING,

12:10.267 --> 12:11.900
AND THESE KIDS
COULDN'T DO WITHOUT IT,

12:11.900 --> 12:14.200
BUT THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE
THAT DON'T BELIEVE IN IT.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.633
IF THIS SCIENTIST IS SPEWING
INACCURATE INFORMATION,

12:17.633 --> 12:21.667
MAYBE WE NEED
TO DISPROVE HER TO SHOW HER VIEW

12:21.667 --> 12:23.067
AND THAT SHE'S WRONG.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.967
Jazz: I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT DOING THIS PODCAST.

12:25.967 --> 12:29.433
I KNOW THAT BY DOING THIS,
I'M GIVING HER A PLATFORM

12:29.433 --> 12:31.367
TO PROMOTE HER RESEARCH
WITH THE WORLD,

12:31.367 --> 12:34.667
AND PROVING PEOPLE WRONG
IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.767
HOW DO I DEBUNK IT?

12:35.767 --> 12:37.633
WHAT DO I SAY,
"OH, THAT'S NOT RIGHT"?

12:37.633 --> 12:39.067
YOU TELL THEM
EXACTLY HOW IT IS.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.667
YOU HAVE TO FIND FACTS
THROUGH RESEARCH, AND I JUST --

12:40.667 --> 12:42.700
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT
THE MOST QUALIFIED.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.800
Greg: THESE TYPE OF MEDIA
REQUESTS ARE TOUGH.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.133
I JUST HAVE NEVER BEEN BIG
ON JAZZ DEBATING

12:48.133 --> 12:51.667
OR HAVING TO ARGUE
IN AN ADVERSARIAL SETTING,

12:51.667 --> 12:53.233
BUT I DO THINK
THAT JAZZ NEEDS

12:53.233 --> 12:56.100
TO KEEP RETELLING HER STORY
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,

12:56.100 --> 12:59.067
AND I THINK THAT PARENTS
NEED TO LISTEN TO THEIR KIDS.

12:59.067 --> 13:03.267
THE MAIN THING IS, JAZZ, IF
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE DOING IT,

13:03.267 --> 13:05.833
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT.

13:05.833 --> 13:09.500
I AM SOMEONE WHO HAS TAKEN
THE HORMONE BLOCKERS,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.067
AND IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.567
THIS RESEARCH IS INVALIDATING
WHO I AM AS A PERSON,

13:14.567 --> 13:17.167
AND IT HURTS.

13:17.167 --> 13:18.367
MM.
ALL RIGHT.

13:18.367 --> 13:19.967
WELL,
JUST THINK ABOUT IT,

13:19.967 --> 13:23.700
AND THEN WE'LL MAKE
A DECISION ANOTHER TIME.

13:25.567 --> 13:33.233
**

13:33.233 --> 13:35.367
Greg: YOU READY TO BOWL
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

13:35.367 --> 13:38.600
I'M READY TO SEE MY PARENTS
AND WATCH THEM BOWL

13:38.600 --> 13:40.900
BECAUSE THEY ARE BOWLERS.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.400
RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.933
SURE.

13:47.933 --> 13:50.600
HONEY, I THINK YOU GOT TO START
FURTHER BACK A LITTLE.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.967
I'M AFRAID OF GOING
OVER THE FOUL TIME.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.867
-YEAH. THANK YOU.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.167
Jeanette: MY PARENTS
ARE EXCEPTIONAL BOWLERS.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.433
SHE KEEPS TELLING ME

13:58.433 --> 14:00.067
THEY HAD A BOWLING BALL
WITH THEIR NAMES ON IT,

14:00.067 --> 14:01.700
THE SHIRTS AND EVERYTHING.

14:01.700 --> 14:02.767
OH, HI, HON.

14:02.767 --> 14:03.833
Jeanette:
IN MY MIND GROWING UP,

14:03.833 --> 14:05.300
THEY WERE, LIKE,
THE GREATEST BOWLERS.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.400
WE SHALL SEE.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.267
LOOK AT HER GO.
SHE HAS SKILLS.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.933
-YOU GOT A SPARE.
-YAY!

14:13.167 --> 14:15.267
Jacky:
OH, SHE REALLY TOSSES.

14:15.267 --> 14:18.067
I HIT ONE.
NO. I GOT A GUTTER.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.467
I WAS ON A BOWLING LEAGUE
WHEN I WAS 12.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.967
I GOT
A PURPLE BOWLING BALL,

14:21.967 --> 14:23.967
AND WE WERE CALLED
THE BOWLING BEAUTIES,

14:23.967 --> 14:25.267
AND WE WERE DAMN UGLY.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.067
SO, JEANETTE,
DID YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS

14:28.067 --> 14:29.800
ABOUT OUR TRIP
TO CALIFORNIA?

14:29.800 --> 14:32.367
NOT REALLY. JUST GLAZED
OVER IT ON THE PHONE.

14:32.367 --> 14:35.500
WELL, REMEMBER HOW
EVERYTHING WAS LEFT OFF?

14:35.500 --> 14:38.833
NICE, LITTLE BOW, MARCI WILL
DO A LITTLE SKIN GRAFT.

14:38.833 --> 14:39.967
-RIGHT.
-NO.

14:39.967 --> 14:42.467
-ERASED. OUT WITH THAT PLAN.

14:42.467 --> 14:43.967
GONE.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.867
Jack:
IT'S NO SURPRISE TO ME

14:45.867 --> 14:49.700
THAT JAZZ CANNOT HAVE
A SIMPLE VAGINOPLASTY.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.900
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE MATERIAL TO WORK WITH,

14:51.900 --> 14:54.433
AND THEY HAVE TO GET IT
FROM SOMEWHERE.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.267
SHE GAVE US
ALL THESE OPTIONS.

14:57.267 --> 15:01.500
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT
THE COMPLICATION RATE WOULD BE,

15:01.500 --> 15:05.567
DOING PROCEDURE "A"
VERSUS PROCEDURE "B"?

15:05.567 --> 15:07.833
Greg: WHAT IF THERE HASN'T
BEEN A COMPLICATION RATE

15:07.833 --> 15:10.100
FOR SUPPRESSED YOUTH?

15:10.100 --> 15:13.967
THAT MEANS THEY HAVEN'T
DONE ENOUGH OF THEM.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.133
Jack: AS A PHYSICIAN
AND A GRANDFATHER,

15:16.133 --> 15:17.567
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO DRAW THE LINE,

15:17.567 --> 15:20.300
BUT I WANT THEM
TO HAVE ENOUGH CASES

15:20.300 --> 15:22.667
WHEREBY THEY'VE HAD
ENOUGH COMPLICATIONS

15:22.667 --> 15:24.667
TO KNOW HOW TO GET
OUT OF TROUBLE.

15:24.667 --> 15:28.733
SHE IS PIONEERING AGAIN,
AND I FEEL VERY BADLY.

15:28.733 --> 15:33.967
THE FIRST THING SHE ACTUALLY
TALKED ABOUT WAS JAZZ'S BMI

15:33.967 --> 15:38.100
BECAUSE, WITH HER CURRENT BMI,
THEY WOULD NOT EVEN PROCEED.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.600
Jack: DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A BMI IS, HONEY?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.133
I DO KNOW WHAT A --
BASAL METABOLISM --

15:42.133 --> 15:43.733
-NO, NO, NO.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.700
IT'S BODY MASS INDEX.
BODY MASS. SORRY.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.600
IN OTHER WORDS,
SHE'S TOO FAT.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.067
**

15:49.067 --> 15:51.467
SOMETIMES, MY DAD
IS A LITTLE DIRECT.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.467
HE DOESN'T BEAT AROUND
THE BUSH.

15:53.467 --> 15:57.067
SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT SHE'S TOO FAT.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.667
JAZZ IS GAINING WEIGHT.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.200
SHE MAY BE UNHAPPY

16:00.200 --> 16:05.233
AND IS USING FOOD
SORT OF AS A TRANQUILIZER.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.700
WE'RE DOING NO SURGERY
TILL JAZZ LOSES WEIGHT.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.967
Jacky: JAZZ'S SURGERY IS NOW
HINGING ON A WEIGHT LOSS,

16:12.967 --> 16:16.100
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.833
I THINK JAZZ
IS ADDICTED TO FOOD.

16:17.833 --> 16:23.900
**

16:23.900 --> 16:29.967
**

16:29.967 --> 16:32.467
Jeanette:
I HAVE KNOWN DR. VOLKER
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

16:32.467 --> 16:34.533
AND I'M ALWAYS WITH JAZZ
WHENEVER I SPEAK TO HER...

16:34.533 --> 16:36.833
KNOCK, KNOCK.
-HI.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.633
-HELLO. HELLO. HELLO.
-OH, MY GOSH.

16:38.633 --> 16:39.900
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.533
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.433
... BUT SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S THINGS

16:43.433 --> 16:45.767
I NEED TO SAY TO HER
WITHOUT JAZZ IN THE ROOM,

16:45.767 --> 16:47.600
SO THIS WAY, I CAN BE UNFILTERED

16:47.600 --> 16:49.367
AND JUST TALK ABOUT CONCERNS
THAT I HAVE

16:49.367 --> 16:51.067
FROM A MOM'S PERSPECTIVE.

16:51.067 --> 16:55.633
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU
AS A MOM, JUST BY YOURSELF,

16:55.633 --> 16:58.600
AND SEE THE THINGS THAT ARE
GOING ON IN YOUR HEART.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.967
SO MUCH IS GOING ON.

17:00.967 --> 17:06.533
I HAVE KNOWN JAZZ AND FAMILY
SINCE JAZZ WAS 3 YEARS OLD,

17:06.533 --> 17:10.067
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO REALLY
GET TO TALK WITH MOM

17:10.067 --> 17:13.433
BECAUSE, SO MANY TIMES,
THEIR VOICES AREN'T HEARD

17:13.433 --> 17:16.533
BECAUSE THEY'RE ADVOCATING
FOR THEIR CHILD

17:16.533 --> 17:19.467
AND PUTTING THEIR
OWN FEELINGS ON HOLD.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.067
I KNOW YOU DON'T SEE JAZZ
ON A REGULAR BASIS ANYMORE,

17:22.067 --> 17:23.767
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE AT THAT POINT

17:23.767 --> 17:26.400
WHERE THE SURGERY
IS DOWN THE ROAD.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.900
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN WITH HER
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING,

17:28.900 --> 17:31.567
AND I KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO HAVE THE TWO LETTERS.

17:31.567 --> 17:35.600
LIKE, WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM JAZZ
AND MYSELF TO GET THAT LETTER?

17:35.600 --> 17:36.967
Jeanette:
TO HAVE THE SURGERY,

17:36.967 --> 17:38.833
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THERAPY
TO GET THE LETTERS,

17:38.833 --> 17:40.800
AND MARILYN
HAS BEEN TREATING JAZZ

17:40.800 --> 17:42.333
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME,

17:42.333 --> 17:45.300
SO SHE'S OUR GO-TO
FOR THAT FIRST LETTER.

17:45.300 --> 17:46.767
WHEN YOU HAVE
THIS SURGERY,

17:46.767 --> 17:49.433
THERE ARE THINGS
THAT ARE REQUIRED,

17:49.433 --> 17:51.967
AND YOU MAY NOT
LIKE SOME OF THEM,

17:51.967 --> 17:57.667
AND I WOULD WANT TO SEE
THAT SHE IS ON THAT PROCESS.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.300
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
THERE'S BEEN AN OBSTACLE

18:00.300 --> 18:03.667
BECAUSE JAZZ'S WEIGHT
HAS REALLY BALLOONED...

18:03.667 --> 18:04.767
OH.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.167
...AND NOW SHE HAS
TO LOSE 30 POUNDS

18:06.167 --> 18:07.867
BEFORE HER BOTTOM SURGERY.

18:07.867 --> 18:10.200
BUT SHE STARTED
BINGE EATING.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.767
IT'S, LIKE, I KNEW SHE WAS
REALLY OUT OF CONTROL,

18:11.767 --> 18:13.867
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW OUT OF CONTROL.

18:13.867 --> 18:17.733
HOW IS THAT AFFECTING
YOU AS MOM?

18:17.733 --> 18:20.967
IT BREAKS MY HEART
BECAUSE I'M SO FEARFUL

18:20.967 --> 18:23.700
THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE
HER FEEL BAD ABOUT HERSELF

18:23.700 --> 18:25.700
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE FEELS
BAD ABOUT HERSELF,

18:25.700 --> 18:27.267
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN I SEE HER,

18:27.267 --> 18:29.067
HER CLOTHES AREN'T FITTING,
AND I POINT IT OUT.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.100
I'M LIKE, "OH, MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT,"

18:31.100 --> 18:34.567
BUT I WANT HER TO SEE THE DAMAGE
THAT SHE'S DOING TO HERSELF.

18:34.567 --> 18:37.067
I'VE SEEN THIS WITH A LOT

18:37.067 --> 18:39.467
OF TRANS TEENAGERS
AND ADULTS...

18:39.467 --> 18:40.967
MM-HMM.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.067
...WHEN THEY GET TO THAT
PIVOTAL POINT FOR SURGERY...

18:43.067 --> 18:44.233
YEAH.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.867
...AND THERE IS THIS
ALMOST AN UNCONSCIOUSLY,

18:46.867 --> 18:51.067
"CAN I SET SOMETHING UP
WHERE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO SAY,

18:51.067 --> 18:53.100
'NOT QUITE YET'"?

18:54.367 --> 19:00.267
Dr. Marilyn:
SABOTAGING BIG MARKER EVENTS
LIKE HAVING A VAGINOPLASTY

19:00.267 --> 19:01.867
IS VERY COMMON.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.600
"I WANT THIS SURGERY,

19:04.600 --> 19:07.167
BUT NOW I GOT TO FACE
ALL THESE THINGS,"

19:07.167 --> 19:10.800
SO SOMETIMES
SABOTAGING BEHAVIOR MEANS,

19:10.800 --> 19:12.067
"IT BUYS ME TIME.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.067
I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

19:14.067 --> 19:18.267
LET ME ESCAPE," AND PERHAPS
THE ESCAPE IS IN THE EATING.

19:18.267 --> 19:21.933
BEFORE THE LETTER,
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER

19:21.933 --> 19:26.533
TO GO THROUGH
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LIFE.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.400
KNOWING JAZZ FROM WHERE SHE WAS
WHEN SHE WAS 3

19:30.400 --> 19:34.400
DOES NOT MEAN TO ME THAT SHE IS
PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY,

19:34.400 --> 19:36.833
AND REALISTICALLY READY
FOR A SURGERY,

19:36.833 --> 19:38.833
SO I AM NOT READY

19:38.833 --> 19:42.633
TO WRITE THE LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION FOR SURGERY.

19:42.633 --> 19:46.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
HYPNOTHERAPY TO HELP THE EATING?

19:46.233 --> 19:48.367
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
RECOMMEND IT.

19:48.367 --> 19:50.400
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE
A BEHAVIORAL STRATEGY.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.633
IT'S NOT SOMETHING MAGIC.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.800
IT ISN'T.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.533
WOMAN:
Right now, we have no evidence

19:56.533 --> 19:58.867
that people are, in fact,
born this way.

19:58.867 --> 20:03.500
Jazz:
ANY TIME YOU CONFRONT SOMEONE
WITH A HATEFUL PERSPECTIVE,

20:03.500 --> 20:05.700
IT IS JUST A NERVOUS SITUATION.

20:08.767 --> 20:15.433
**

20:18.033 --> 20:19.400
Hello.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.100
HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

20:21.100 --> 20:22.200
Nothing.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.267
I'm sweating because
it's really hot in here.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.433
OH.
YOU LOOK FINE.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.633
Jazz: I HAVE A LOT GOING ON
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

20:29.633 --> 20:31.900
WHEN IT COMES TO A LOT
OF MY TRANSGENDER ISSUES,

20:31.900 --> 20:34.467
SKYLAR IS ONE
OF MY GO-TO FRIENDS.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.133
SHE CAN REALLY RELATE TO ME
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SURGERY.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.800
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I VISITED

20:39.800 --> 20:42.833
DR. MARCI BOWERS
IN SAN FRANCISCO, MY SURGEON,

20:42.833 --> 20:45.267
AND IT WAS INSANE.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.533
SHE GAVE ME
DIFFERENT OPTIONS,

20:46.533 --> 20:48.900
BUT SHE SAID I MIGHT HAVE
TO DO ALL THE OPTIONS.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.467
When I went in
for my consultation,

20:50.467 --> 20:51.867
my surgeon
was marking me up,

20:51.867 --> 20:54.500
and he, like, marked areas
for skin grafts,

20:54.500 --> 20:55.833
but, like,
I woke up from surgery,

20:55.833 --> 20:57.200
and I didn't end up
needing them.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.067
SO, THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
THAT YOU HAD ENOUGH TISSUE.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.667
Yeah.
SO THERE'S ACTUALLY

21:01.667 --> 21:04.167
SOME OTHER INTERESTING NEWS
THAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU ABOUT

21:04.167 --> 21:07.067
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
I FEEL ABOUT IT AT THIS MOMENT.

21:07.067 --> 21:10.067
BASICALLY,
THERE'S THIS PODCAST,

21:10.067 --> 21:12.800
AND THERE'S GOING
TO BE A SCIENTIST

21:12.800 --> 21:15.800
WHO BELIEVES THAT
USING THE HORMONE
BLOCKERS IS NOT OKAY,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.767
THAT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
SHOULD GO THROUGH PUBERTY

21:17.767 --> 21:21.967
BECAUSE 80 PERCENT OF THEM
CHANGE THEIR MINDS ANYWAY.

21:21.967 --> 21:23.500
I think she needs
fact-checking.

21:23.500 --> 21:27.100
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M THE RIGHT PERSON

21:27.100 --> 21:30.967
TO BE DEBATING
WITH SOMEONE ABOUT THIS.

21:30.967 --> 21:34.067
I think you should do it
because you were that child

21:34.067 --> 21:35.533
that wasn't
on hormone blockers

21:35.533 --> 21:38.067
or hormones
or anything at one point.

21:38.067 --> 21:41.300
I'M A LIVING EXAMPLE
OF A TRANSGENDER CHILD

21:41.300 --> 21:44.433
WHO REALLY WAS TRANSGENDER
AND DIDN'T CHANGE HER MIND.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.667
TALKING WITH YOU,
IT REALLY JUST CONFIRMS

21:46.667 --> 21:49.867
THAT WHAT THE SCIENTIST
IS SAYING IS CLEARLY WRONG,

21:49.867 --> 21:52.067
AND I FEEL LIKE
SOMEONE NEEDS TO STEP UP

21:52.067 --> 21:53.800
AND, YOU KNOW,
TALK TO HER.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.900
IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE
FULLY CONFIDENT

21:55.900 --> 21:57.433
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PANEL,

21:57.433 --> 21:59.067
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS

21:59.067 --> 22:01.467
THAT I COULD COMBAT
THE SCIENTIST

22:01.467 --> 22:03.067
TO SHUT HER DOWN.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.933
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU
FOR BEING A LISTENING EAR

22:04.933 --> 22:06.100
AND LETTING ME TALK TO YOU.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.900
Of course.
Anytime.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.900
ALL RIGHT.
PEACE OUT.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.500
* NA, NA, NA *

22:11.500 --> 22:14.133
* NA-NA, NA, NA-NA-NA, NA, NA *

22:14.133 --> 22:15.733
* NA, NA, NA *

22:15.733 --> 22:18.433
* NA-NA, NA, NA-NA-NA, NA *

22:18.433 --> 22:19.900
**

22:19.900 --> 22:21.500
-HELLO.
-HI.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.067
HOW ARE YOU?
-I'M JAZZ.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.533
HI, JAZZ.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

22:24.533 --> 22:25.867
I'M JEANETTE.
HI, JEANETTE.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.100
THANKS FOR HAVING US.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.233
TODAY, I AM GOING TO VISIT
A HYPNOTHERAPIST,

22:30.233 --> 22:32.367
AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED.

22:32.367 --> 22:33.767
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT,
JAZZ?

22:33.767 --> 22:35.533
YOU GET THE BIG,
COMFORTABLE CHAIR OVER THERE.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.167
-OH, OKAY.
-YOU GET THE THRONE.

22:37.167 --> 22:39.800
Jazz: MY EATING ISSUES
ARE BEYOND MY CONTROL.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.567
I FEEL LIKE THIS THERAPIST,
IF SHE HYPNOTIZES ME,

22:42.567 --> 22:43.833
MAYBE SHE'LL CONVINCE ME

22:43.833 --> 22:45.400
THAT BROCCOLI TASTES
LIKE FRENCH FRIES

22:45.400 --> 22:47.067
AND FRENCH FRIES TASTE
LIKE BROCCOLI,

22:47.067 --> 22:49.233
AND THEN MY MIND
WILL BE, LIKE, ALL MAGICAL,

22:49.233 --> 22:50.633
AND I'LL LOSE WEIGHT.

22:50.633 --> 22:54.200
JAZZ, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GAIN OUT OF THIS PROCESS?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.700
WHAT'S YOUR GOALS?

22:55.700 --> 23:00.133
TO, YOU KNOW,
NOT BE SO TEMPTED BY FOOD.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.433
OKAY.

23:01.433 --> 23:03.067
I WANT TO HAVE CONTROL
OVER IT.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.200
MY NAME IS KELI RAYMOND.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.500
I'M A CERTIFIED CLINICAL
HYPNOTHERAPIST.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.400
WE ALL STRUGGLE
WITH COMMON ISSUES,

23:09.400 --> 23:12.800
AND IN HYPNOTHERAPY,
IT'S ALL EMOTIONAL WORK,

23:12.800 --> 23:14.600
AND I LOVE WORKING
WITH YOUNG ADULTS

23:14.600 --> 23:19.833
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH LESS TO
UNDO THAN WORKING WITH ADULTS.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.467
Keli: THIS IS GOING
TO BE A PROCESS

23:21.467 --> 23:23.500
OF PEELING BACK
THE LAYERS OF THE ONION

23:23.500 --> 23:28.900
TO DISCOVER AND UNCOVER
WHAT'S DRIVING THE BINGEING,

23:28.900 --> 23:32.700
SO THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR US
TO BEGIN OUR DIALOGUE.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.133
BYE, MOM.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.600
SO LONG, FAREWELL.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.533
Jazz: WHEN I'M BEING FORCED
INTO THERAPY,

23:37.533 --> 23:41.633
I FEEL LESS INCLINED TO BE OPEN
OR TO SHARE HOW I'M FEELING.

23:41.633 --> 23:44.367
BECAUSE HYPNOTHERAPY
WAS MY CHOICE,

23:44.367 --> 23:45.967
I JUST FEEL BETTER
ABOUT DOING THIS

23:45.967 --> 23:48.967
THAN I HAVE
IN PREVIOUS THERAPY SESSIONS.

23:48.967 --> 23:51.267
EXPLAIN TO ME THE NATURE
OF YOUR EATING

23:51.267 --> 23:54.433
AND JUST SORT OF GIVE ME AN IDEA
ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.700
SO WHEN I DO IT, SOMETIMES
I DON'T EAT DURING THE DAY...

23:57.700 --> 23:59.133
MM-HMM.
...AND THEN I WAIT

23:59.133 --> 24:00.467
TILL I BINGE AT NIGHT.

24:00.467 --> 24:02.867
MY GRANDMA CALLS IT
"STARVE AND STUFF."

24:02.867 --> 24:04.133
YEAH.
IT'S A COMMON PATTERN.

24:04.133 --> 24:05.533
MM-HMM.

24:05.533 --> 24:07.800
CAN YOU SORT OF THINK
TO WHEN IT IS

24:07.800 --> 24:09.467
THAT YOU'RE INCLINED
TO BINGE?

24:09.467 --> 24:11.733
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU
AT THE TIME?

24:11.733 --> 24:15.600
STRESS.
DEFINITELY.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.433
LIKE, I KIND OF FEEL, LIKE,
VERY WEAK IN THAT MOMENT.

24:18.433 --> 24:20.300
MM-HMM.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.267
DO YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
ACCESSING YOUR EMOTIONS

24:23.267 --> 24:25.167
AS A GENERAL RULE?

24:25.167 --> 24:28.100
UM, YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS SAY I DON'T.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.933
I ALWAYS SAY
I'M VERY EXPRESSIVE,

24:29.933 --> 24:32.100
BUT I HONESTLY FEEL
LIKE I'M NOT.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.800
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.200
LIKE, MY MIND IS JUST SO,
LIKE, ALL OVER THE PLACE,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.433
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE TRUTH REALLY IS.

24:40.433 --> 24:41.900
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE 16.

24:41.900 --> 24:45.200
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT
ALL SORTED OUT YET.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.600
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS
FOR YOURSELF, DON'T YOU?

24:48.600 --> 24:50.400
I GUESS SO.
YEAH.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.400
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A LOT OF POTENTIAL...

24:52.400 --> 24:53.533
MM-HMM.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.933
...AND I'M NOT LIVING UP
TO IT WHEN I EAT.

24:54.933 --> 24:56.167
SORRY.
I ALWAYS CRY.

24:56.167 --> 24:57.333
NO.
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS.

24:57.333 --> 24:58.467
THIS IS A WONDERFUL PLACE

24:58.467 --> 25:01.067
TO ALLOW YOURSELF
TO FEEL EMOTIONS.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.133
I WANT YOU TO GIVE YOURSELF
PERMISSION IN THIS SPACE

25:04.133 --> 25:05.733
TO KNOW THAT IT'S SAFE
TO FEEL IT

25:05.733 --> 25:09.233
AND IT'S HEALING TO FEEL IT,
SO DON'T TRY AND HOLD THAT DOWN.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.233
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

25:11.233 --> 25:14.533
Jazz:
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH KELI,
EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS.

25:14.533 --> 25:16.067
IT'S SOMETHING NEW FOR ME,

25:16.067 --> 25:18.733
SO I'M EAGER TO ACTUALLY
START THE HYPNOSIS PART.

25:18.733 --> 25:20.567
I REALLY NEED TO FIX
THIS PROBLEM

25:20.567 --> 25:22.567
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

25:22.567 --> 25:25.733
JUST TAKE A DEEP,
CLEANSING BREATH IN,

25:25.733 --> 25:28.133
AND HOLD IT BRIEFLY,

25:28.133 --> 25:34.400
AND AS YOU SLOWLY EXHALE,
JUST THINK, "RELAX."

25:34.400 --> 25:36.367
PERFECT.

25:36.367 --> 25:39.300
SO NOW, JAZZ,
AS YOU HAVE SETTLED IN

25:39.300 --> 25:41.567
TO YOUR PEACEFUL SANCTUARY,

25:41.567 --> 25:42.967
AS YOU LOOK DOWN,

25:42.967 --> 25:46.067
YOU NOTICE THAT THERE
ARE BAGS AND BAGS

25:46.067 --> 25:48.067
THAT ARE THERE
AT YOUR FEET.

25:48.067 --> 25:51.333
THESE BAGS REPRESENT
EARLY CHILDHOOD EVENTS

25:51.333 --> 25:55.200
THAT FACTOR
INTO YOUR BINGEING.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.767
IT'S TIME NOW
TO RELEASE THEM.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.933
AS I'M LISTENING
TO KELI'S VOICE,

26:00.933 --> 26:03.067
I'M JUST LETTING GO.

26:03.067 --> 26:05.800
I JUST FEEL VERY RELAXED
AND SLEEPY,

26:05.800 --> 26:08.367
LIKE YOU'RE IN ANOTHER WORLD.

26:08.367 --> 26:12.233
THIS IS A PLACE OF HEALING.

26:12.233 --> 26:16.667
THIS IS A PLACE
OF TRANSFORMATION.

26:16.667 --> 26:19.067
YOUR BODY,
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND

26:19.067 --> 26:22.100
IS INSTRUCTING YOU
TO EAT SLOWER

26:22.100 --> 26:25.300
WITH EACH AND EVERY BAG
THAT YOU RELEASE.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.300
SO NOW, IN A MOMENT,
IT'S TIME TO COME BACK,

26:27.300 --> 26:30.067
BRINGING BACK WITH YOU ALL OF
THESE POSITIVE QUALITIES.

26:30.067 --> 26:32.667
**

26:32.667 --> 26:35.100
HELLO.
WELCOME BACK.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.967
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

26:37.967 --> 26:39.700
RELAXED.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.600
Jazz:
AFTER HYPNOSIS, I FEEL

26:41.600 --> 26:44.700
LIKE I HAVE
A SENSE OF MENTAL CLARITY.

26:44.700 --> 26:48.067
AS I CONTINUE
TO BECOME HYPNOTIZED,

26:48.067 --> 26:49.433
IT'LL BE EASIER AND EASIER?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.067
YES.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.667
YOU WILL GO DEEPER AND FASTER
EACH AND EVERY SUBSEQUENT TIME.

26:53.667 --> 26:57.067
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A NEW MOTIVATION TO LOSE WEIGHT.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.167
-HELLO.
-HELLO. SHE DID WONDERFULLY.

26:59.167 --> 27:00.933
THIS IS A PROCESS,
AND THERE'S NO REASON

27:00.933 --> 27:02.367
THAT SHE CAN'T GET
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

27:02.367 --> 27:03.900
SHE ABSOLUTELY CAN.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.567
I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS FINALLY
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO WORK,

27:06.567 --> 27:09.200
BUT THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING
UNTIL I SEE THE RESULTS.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.267
YEAH.
LET ME GIVE YOU A HUG.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.800
YOU'RE A DELIGHT.
I LOVE HUGS.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.567
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

27:14.567 --> 27:18.267
WOMAN:
We've all been concerned about
people changing their minds.

27:18.267 --> 27:20.600
Jazz: THIS RESEARCH IS
NEGATIVELY AFFECTING

27:20.600 --> 27:22.300
THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.400
HAD I BROUGHT
LITTLE JAZZ TO YOU,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.467
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
TOLD ME AS A PARENT?

27:26.467 --> 27:29.733
If we did anything, it would
be gentle discouragement.

27:32.933 --> 27:40.967
**

27:40.967 --> 27:42.733
HEY.
HEY.

27:42.733 --> 27:43.767
WHAT'S UP?

27:43.767 --> 27:46.067
THAT'S PROBABLY TOO LOUD
FOR A LIBRARY.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.633
I KNOW.
I'M TOO LOUD TO BE HERE.

27:48.633 --> 27:51.100
Jazz: WHEN IT COMES
TO APPROACHING THIS RADIO SHOW,

27:51.100 --> 27:53.400
I NEED TO LOOK
AT THE RESEARCH,

27:53.400 --> 27:56.800
FIGURE OUT THE FALLACIES
WITHIN IT BEFORE I DO IT.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.167
I JUST FEEL LIKE
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME

27:58.167 --> 28:00.167
TO DEVELOP SOME SORT
OF COUNTERCLAIMS

28:00.167 --> 28:02.100
BEFORE I GO INTO THIS.

28:02.100 --> 28:04.800
NOELLE IS A GREAT PERSON
TO HELP PREPARE ME

28:04.800 --> 28:07.567
BECAUSE SHE IS
IN DEBATE CLASS,

28:07.567 --> 28:10.100
AND SHE LOVES
PROVING PEOPLE WRONG,

28:10.100 --> 28:11.967
AND I FEEL LIKE SHE COULD
REALLY PREPARE ME

28:11.967 --> 28:13.767
TO COMBAT THIS SCIENTIST.

28:13.767 --> 28:16.067
HER STUDY SAYS
THAT SHE COLLECTED

28:16.067 --> 28:19.433
A SAMPLE OF 127 ADOLESCENTS

28:19.433 --> 28:22.133
WHO WERE REFERRED
FOR GENDER DYSPHORIA
IN CHILDHOOD.

28:22.133 --> 28:25.200
THAT'S A PRETTY SMALL
SAMPLE SIZE.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.100
SHE BELIEVES THAT,
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY

28:28.100 --> 28:29.833
TO GO THROUGH PUBERTY
A LITTLE BIT,

28:29.833 --> 28:32.133
THAT MOST OF US
WOULD REVERT BACK.

28:32.133 --> 28:33.800
BUT THEY'RE CONTROVERSIAL
FINDINGS.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.233
SHE'S BASICALLY SAYING THAT

28:35.233 --> 28:37.167
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KNOW
IF SOMEONE'S TRANS

28:37.167 --> 28:39.600
IS IF THEY FACE
EXTREME PAIN DURING PUBERTY.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.833
MM-HMM.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.433
IT'S AKIN TO SAYING
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN KNOW

28:42.433 --> 28:45.533
IF YOUR CHILD CAN SWIM
IS BY DROWNING THEM.

28:45.533 --> 28:49.567
THIS RESEARCH SOUNDS FAMILIAR
JUST BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

28:49.567 --> 28:51.633
I WAS LOOKING UP
WHAT IT MEANT TO BE TRANS.

28:51.633 --> 28:53.400
I WANTED TO KNOW
THAT I WASN'T ALONE,

28:53.400 --> 28:57.200
AND I STUMBLED ACROSS
A LOT OF BIGOTED IDEOLOGIES.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.600
NOBODY NEEDS TO GO THROUGH
PUBERTY TO SEE IF THEY'RE TRANS.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.967
I KNEW I WANTED TO BE A GIRL

29:01.967 --> 29:05.067
AS SOON AS I COULD DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN GENDERS.

29:05.067 --> 29:08.133
SO ONLY 12.2 PERCENT
OF THE PARTICIPANTS

29:08.133 --> 29:10.700
WERE JUDGED TO HAVE
PERSISTENT GENDER DYSPHORIA.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.733
"HOWEVER,
THIS CALCULATION INCLUDED

29:12.733 --> 29:16.667
23 PARTICIPANTS WHO COULD NOT
BE TRACE CONTACTED AT FOLLOW-UP

29:16.667 --> 29:18.633
BUT WERE ASSUMED
TO BE DESISTERS."

29:18.633 --> 29:21.067
THAT'S LITERALLY
JUST AN ASSUMPTION.

29:21.067 --> 29:22.200
SHE PUT THAT
IN HER FINDINGS?

29:22.200 --> 29:23.867
MM-HMM.

29:23.867 --> 29:27.267
Jazz:
THIS SCIENTIST USES THE TERMS
"PERSISTER" AND "DESISTER."

29:27.267 --> 29:29.700
PERSISTER IS SOMEONE WHO CHOOSES

29:29.700 --> 29:31.867
TO FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THEIR TRANSITION,

29:31.867 --> 29:34.100
AND A DESISTER IS SOMEONE
WHO REVERTS

29:34.100 --> 29:35.900
BACK TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL GENDER.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.633
I THINK ANY RESEARCH WHERE
YOU'RE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS

29:38.633 --> 29:40.933
AND CALCULATING THAT
INTO YOUR CONCLUSION

29:40.933 --> 29:43.467
IS NOT VERY RELIABLE.

29:43.467 --> 29:46.467
DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO JUST
CONFRONT HER A LITTLE BIT?

29:46.467 --> 29:47.967
LITTLE, LITTLE, LITTLE BIT.

29:47.967 --> 29:49.300
LITTLE BIT.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.367
Noelle: EVEN THOUGH IT MAY
COME OFF AS CONTROVERSIAL,

29:51.367 --> 29:53.800
I DO THINK
IT'S VERY NECESSARY AND GOOD

29:53.800 --> 29:56.267
THAT WE ARE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION

29:56.267 --> 29:59.733
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT
THERE IS ROOM FOR DISSENSION,

29:59.733 --> 30:02.367
EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT
BE WRONG FACTUALLY.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.300
I'M REALLY STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT

30:05.300 --> 30:06.700
AND SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO

30:06.700 --> 30:08.367
TO PUT THIS SCIENTIST
IN HER PLACE

30:08.367 --> 30:09.933
BECAUSE IF SHE'S LIKE,
"NO.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.767
YOU'RE NOT
ACTUALLY YOURSELF

30:11.767 --> 30:14.000
'CAUSE YOU ARE A DESISTER,"

30:14.000 --> 30:16.400
HONEY, WE AIN'T DESISTERS.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.300
WE'RE SISTERS.

30:19.467 --> 30:21.700
OKAY.
THAT WAS CORNY.

30:21.700 --> 30:27.667
**

30:27.667 --> 30:28.700
Jeanette: HELLO.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.133
-I GOT THE DOOR.
-THANK YOU, SON.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.667
Jazz: I USUALLY LOVE
GOING OUT TO DINNER.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.300
HOWEVER, I AM DIETING NOW.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.600
I HAVE TO STAY ON TRACK
WHEN IT COMES TO LOSING WEIGHT.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.067
HOW WE DOING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?

30:42.067 --> 30:43.433
ARE WE PREPARED FOR
ANY APPETIZERS

30:43.433 --> 30:44.633
OR ANYTHING WE'D LIKE
TO GET STARTED WITH?

30:44.633 --> 30:45.967
OOH,
CAN WE GET A SPINACH DIP?

30:45.967 --> 30:47.233
ABSOLUTELY.
-NO.

30:47.233 --> 30:48.700
-AND THEN...
-DO NOT. NO. NO. NO. NO.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.633
...I'M GOING TO GET
A FRENCH ONION SOUP.

30:50.633 --> 30:51.567
FRENCH ONION.
YES, SIR.

30:51.567 --> 30:52.600
THANK YOU.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.800
AREN'T YOU GUYS SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING ME?

30:53.800 --> 30:56.133
**

30:56.133 --> 30:57.833
CAN I GET THE RIBS, PLEASE?

30:57.833 --> 30:59.533
Sander: I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
VERY HARD FOR JAZZ

30:59.533 --> 31:01.133
TO RESIST THE TEMPTATIONS.

31:01.133 --> 31:03.467
LET'S JUST SAY JAZZ
MADE A BIG MISTAKE

31:03.467 --> 31:05.167
SITTING NEXT TO ME
AT THIS MEAL.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.133
BIG MISTAKE.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.433
I'M GOING TO GET
THE BEER MUENSTER CHEESE SOUP

31:08.433 --> 31:09.433
INSTEAD OF THE FRENCH ONION.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.667
-OKAY.

31:10.667 --> 31:11.800
-THE BEER MUENSTER CHEESE.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.633
THE BEER CHEESE SOUP
IS MY FAVORITE THING

31:14.633 --> 31:16.700
'CAUSE IT COMES
IN A BREAD BOWL.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.600
YOU'LL SHOW WILLPOWER.
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.700
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.167
WHAT THE...?

31:21.167 --> 31:22.433
JAZZ, YOU'LL GET
A HEALTHY DINNER.

31:22.433 --> 31:23.967
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.267
Jazz: I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY'RE JUST THAT HUNGRY

31:26.267 --> 31:28.267
AND REALLY WANT
TO EAT THAT UNHEALTHY

31:28.267 --> 31:31.133
OR IF THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY
TRYING TO TEMPT ME,

31:31.133 --> 31:34.133
SO I HOPE THAT HYPNOTHERAPY
ACTUALLY WORKS.

31:34.133 --> 31:36.833
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
TRYING TO, LIKE, TRY?

31:36.833 --> 31:38.500
'CAUSE I KNOW LAST TIME
I SAW YOU, YOU WERE LIKE,

31:38.500 --> 31:39.500
"I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.800
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE."

31:42.067 --> 31:43.933
-IT'S TRUE.
-THAT WAS PERFECT.

31:43.933 --> 31:45.600
Jazz: OBVIOUSLY, IT'S BEEN
A PROBLEM FOR A WHILE

31:45.600 --> 31:47.167
THAT I'VE BEEN BINGE EATING,

31:47.167 --> 31:50.200
BUT REALLY, IT WAS WHEN
I VISITED DR. MARCI BOWERS

31:50.200 --> 31:51.767
THAT KIND OF
KICKED IT INTO ME.

31:51.767 --> 31:53.467
DO YOU THINK THE HYPNOSIS
HELPED AT ALL?

31:53.467 --> 31:54.900
IS IT WORKING?

31:54.900 --> 31:57.067
-UM...
-GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT NOW.

31:57.067 --> 32:00.200
Greg:
OH, THAT MUST BE SANDER'S.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.867
-THANK YOU.

32:01.867 --> 32:04.400
-OOH, SHRIMP.
-OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.333
Ari: THIS IS HUGE.
THIS IS SO BIG.

32:07.333 --> 32:08.500
Greg: THANK YOU.

32:08.500 --> 32:09.900
Jazz:
IT'S DEFINITELY VERY DIFFICULT

32:09.900 --> 32:11.367
TO RESIST THIS FOOD,

32:11.367 --> 32:16.267
ESPECIALLY THIS BIG BREAD BOWL
FILLED WITH BEER CHEESE SOUP.

32:16.267 --> 32:19.367
OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS MY LIFE RIGHT THERE.

32:19.367 --> 32:22.433
Ari: HOLY MOLY.

32:22.433 --> 32:24.100
HONESTLY...

32:24.100 --> 32:25.367
JUST FOCUS ON YOUR FOOD.

32:26.567 --> 32:30.067
I THINK JAZZ DOES HAVE A LOT
OF POWER TO RESIST TEMPTATIONS.

32:30.067 --> 32:32.267
I JUST THINK IT'S WHETHER
SHE WANTS TO OR NOT.

32:32.267 --> 32:34.200
USUALLY, SHE DIVES IN
AND STARTS EATING

32:34.200 --> 32:36.167
AND TRYING TO GET
THE MOST FOOD IN HER MOUTH,

32:36.167 --> 32:37.467
BUT IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE HER

32:37.467 --> 32:41.867
JUST KIND OF ENJOY HER LETTUCE
OR WHATEVER.

32:41.867 --> 32:44.400
-SO MUCH FOOD.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.067
Jazz: WELL, I'M MOTIVATED
TO STAY ON TASK,

32:47.067 --> 32:48.833
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET
THIS BEER CHEESE SOUP

32:48.833 --> 32:50.267
OR THIS SPINACH
AND ARTICHOKE DIP

32:50.267 --> 32:52.533
OR THIS PIZZA OR THIS RIBS

32:52.533 --> 32:55.267
OR ANYTHING THAT'S ON
THE TABLE TEMPT ME.

32:55.267 --> 32:56.800
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.
I DON'T NEED THAT ANYMORE.

32:58.433 --> 33:07.500
**

33:07.500 --> 33:10.067
Jeanette: DO YOU FEEL LIKE
WE COULD BE IN OVER OUR HEAD?

33:10.067 --> 33:12.133
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

33:12.133 --> 33:14.067
YEAH.

33:14.067 --> 33:17.067
Jazz: MY MOM AND I ARE DRIVING
TO THE PODCAST TODAY,

33:17.067 --> 33:19.467
AND I'M HONESTLY
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

33:19.467 --> 33:21.667
THIS RESEARCH IS
NEGATIVELY AFFECTING

33:21.667 --> 33:23.600
THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE,

33:23.600 --> 33:26.700
AND I HAVE TO ENSURE
THAT I GET MY VIEWPOINT ACROSS

33:26.700 --> 33:29.200
AND PROVE THIS RESEARCH WRONG.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.600
IT'S JUST ALWAYS HARD
WHEN WE PUT OURSELVES

33:31.600 --> 33:32.933
IN THAT LINE OF FIRE

33:32.933 --> 33:35.067
WHERE IT'S GOING
TO BE WITH SOMEONE

33:35.067 --> 33:38.700
WHO DOESN'T NECESSARILY AGREE
WITH WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.233
WE NEED TO WIN THIS DEBATE.

33:40.233 --> 33:42.567
YEAH.
FOR REAL.

33:44.833 --> 33:53.133
**

33:53.133 --> 33:55.933
-WELL, HERE WE GO.

33:55.933 --> 33:59.100
I AM DEFINITELY FEELING
A LITTLE TENSE.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.300
HI.
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.700
ANYTIME YOU CONFRONT SOMEONE

34:03.700 --> 34:08.167
WITH A DIFFERING VIEWPOINT
OR A HATEFUL PERSPECTIVE,

34:08.167 --> 34:10.533
IT IS JUST
A NERVOUS SITUATION.

34:10.533 --> 34:11.567
Man: STAND BY.
HERE WE GO.

34:11.567 --> 34:13.633
**

34:17.733 --> 34:20.333
Paul: GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY,
AND WELCOME TO ANOTHER EPISODE

34:20.333 --> 34:21.633
OF "THE QIEW."

34:21.633 --> 34:23.733
WE HAVE AN AWESOME
PODCAST TODAY.

34:23.733 --> 34:25.767
THIS PANEL DISCUSSION
IS GOING TO CAUSE

34:25.767 --> 34:27.133
A LITTLE BIT OF RUFFLES,

34:27.133 --> 34:28.933
A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROVERSY,
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.367
JENNIFER McCLAIN.
HEY, JENNIFER.

34:30.367 --> 34:32.567
INTRODUCE WHAT
OUR DISCUSSION TOPIC IS TODAY.

34:32.567 --> 34:35.900
IS GENDER DYSPHORIA
A PASSING PHASE,

34:35.900 --> 34:38.200
AND SHOULD CHILDREN BE ALLOWED
TO BEGIN TRANSITIONING

34:38.200 --> 34:39.567
BEFORE THEY REACH PUBERTY?

34:39.567 --> 34:42.533
AND TO DISCUSS THIS, WE'VE GOT
A GREAT PANEL ASSEMBLED

34:42.533 --> 34:45.833
INCLUDING DR. SUSAN BRADLEY
FROM TORONTO, CANADA,

34:45.833 --> 34:47.733
WHO HAS WORKED WITH
THE CLARKE INSTITUTE.

34:47.733 --> 34:49.100
Paul:
DR. BRADLEY COULD NOT TRAVEL,

34:49.100 --> 34:51.700
SO SHE WILL
BE VIA TELEPHONE TODAY.

34:51.700 --> 34:53.267
HI, DR. BRADLEY.
HOW ARE YOU?

34:53.267 --> 34:54.633
DR. SUSAN: Fine.
How are you?

34:54.633 --> 34:56.567
I'M DOING WELL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34:56.567 --> 34:58.733
ALSO ANOTHER PANELIST,
WE HAVE ZINNIA JONES,

34:58.733 --> 35:00.100
A RESEARCHER FROM ORLANDO.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.100
HI.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.400
I'M ZINNIA JONES.
I'M A TRANS WOMAN.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.267
I'M A MOM, AND I'M A RESEARCHER

35:06.267 --> 35:09.533
OF GENDER DYSPHORIA
IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.

35:09.533 --> 35:12.367
AND JAZZ JENNINGS
ALONG WITH HER MOTHER, JEANETTE.

35:12.367 --> 35:14.367
-HEY.
-WELCOME. WELCOME. WELCOME.

35:14.367 --> 35:16.933
TO MY RIGHT, JODIE PATTERSON
HERE FROM NEW YORK CITY

35:16.933 --> 35:19.200
WHO HAS A TRANSGENDER
SON, AS WELL.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.633
Jodie: MY THIRD CHILD, PENELOPE,
WAS ASSIGNED FEMALE AT BIRTH,

35:21.633 --> 35:24.700
BUT PENELOPE, EARLY ON,

35:24.700 --> 35:27.833
STARTED SHOWING SIGNS
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

35:27.833 --> 35:29.667
SOMETHING WAS NOT SETTLED.

35:29.667 --> 35:31.267
YOUR SON IS 10?

35:31.267 --> 35:32.333
10. YES. 10.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.067
AND WHERE ARE YOU
IN ALL OF THIS

35:34.067 --> 35:35.467
AS FAR AS TRANSITIONING?

35:35.467 --> 35:37.633
WE HAVE DONE NOTHING
TO SUPPRESS PUBERTY

35:37.633 --> 35:39.567
BECAUSE THE PUBERTY
IS NOT AN ISSUE YET,

35:39.567 --> 35:42.233
BUT WHEN I THINK
ABOUT INGESTING CHEMICALS,

35:42.233 --> 35:45.333
IT MAKES ME NERVOUS,
AND THAT'S JUST ON A MOM LEVEL.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.200
I JUST THINK OF THEM AS MY
GENDER VITAMINS, FRANKLY, SO...

35:49.500 --> 35:50.967
YEAH.

35:50.967 --> 35:52.200
Jodie: YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
HAVE TO TAKE A DEEP SIGH

35:52.200 --> 35:53.500
AROUND MEDICAL CHANGES

35:53.500 --> 35:55.867
BECAUSE, ONE,
I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT MEDICINE.

35:55.867 --> 35:57.467
IT'S JUST MY NATURE.

35:57.467 --> 36:01.467
BUT THAT BEING SAID,
MY CHILD MIGHT WANT
PUBERTY SUPPRESSORS,

36:01.467 --> 36:03.467
AND SO I WANTED TO COME TODAY
AND SIT WITH JAZZ

36:03.467 --> 36:05.167
AND SIT WITH HER MOM
AND SIT WITH A DOCTOR

36:05.167 --> 36:07.733
AND HEAR
FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT SIDES.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.067
SO, DR. BRADLEY, GIVE EVERYBODY
KIND OF AN OVERVIEW

36:10.067 --> 36:11.500
OF THE RESEARCH
YOU'VE DONE.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.500
A LITTLE BIT CONTROVERSIAL.
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.433
Well, the most significant one

36:16.433 --> 36:20.900
is the long-term flow of kids
seen in the clinic.

36:20.900 --> 36:24.067
These children all had
gender dysphoria,

36:24.067 --> 36:26.900
aged between 3 and 9 or 10,

36:26.900 --> 36:29.067
and we followed up to see

36:29.067 --> 36:32.400
whether or not
the gender dysphoria persisted.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.367
WERE THEY STILL HAVING
GENDER DYSPHORIA?

36:35.367 --> 36:37.400
No.
The majority of them,

36:37.400 --> 36:39.800
that is, about 85 percent,

36:39.800 --> 36:43.167
had lost their desire
to transition.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.933
Many of them self-identified
as gay or lesbian.

36:46.933 --> 36:50.133
YOU SAID A LOT OF
THE INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR STUDY

36:50.133 --> 36:52.600
IDENTIFIED AS GAY OR LESBIAN,

36:52.600 --> 36:55.500
SO I'M CONFUSED IF THOSE PEOPLE
THAT WE TITLE AS DESISTERS

36:55.500 --> 36:57.700
WERE ACTUALLY TRANSGENDER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36:57.700 --> 37:01.067
All of the kids who were
seen in the clinic

37:01.067 --> 37:05.100
had a dislike of their
birth-assigned gender.

37:05.100 --> 37:08.133
BUT I'M WONDERING,
DID ALL OF THEM SELF-IDENTIFY

37:08.133 --> 37:09.967
AS THE OPPOSITE GENDER?

37:09.967 --> 37:13.733
Well, when you're talking
about kids who are 3 and 4,

37:13.733 --> 37:16.767
the identification
can be fluctuant.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.433
Some wouldn't identify.

37:18.433 --> 37:21.700
I mean, there's a broad
mixture of kids

37:21.700 --> 37:23.667
who present with
gender dysphoria.

37:23.667 --> 37:24.833
IT MAY BE THE CASE

37:24.833 --> 37:27.800
THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY
DESISTING FROM ANYTHING

37:27.800 --> 37:31.567
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T TRANSGENDER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

37:31.567 --> 37:34.067
None of us can say that.

37:34.067 --> 37:36.233
I THINK THAT TRANS PEOPLE
THEMSELVES KNOW.

37:36.233 --> 37:39.567
I THINK DR. BRADLEY
IS REALLY UNDERESTIMATING

37:39.567 --> 37:41.867
THE INTELLIGENCE
OF YOUNG CHILDREN,

37:41.867 --> 37:43.733
AND I FEEL LIKE,
AT THAT YOUNGER AGE,

37:43.733 --> 37:47.300
I HAD A BETTER SENSE OF SELF,
AND I KNEW MY OWN IDENTITY.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.700
DR. BRADLEY,
HOW DO YOU FEEL

37:48.700 --> 37:50.967
ABOUT TRANSITIONING
BEFORE PUBERTY?

37:50.967 --> 37:54.200
We've all been uncomfortable
about intervention

37:54.200 --> 37:58.067
because of our concern about
people changing their minds.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.900
Right now, we have no evidence
that people are, in fact,

38:00.900 --> 38:03.533
born this way.

38:03.533 --> 38:07.667
You know, the transition is
such a huge issue for people.

38:07.667 --> 38:10.833
To assume that because
somebody at some age

38:10.833 --> 38:12.800
makes a statement,
"I'm trans,"

38:12.800 --> 38:16.667
that they will continue
to feel that way as they mature,

38:16.667 --> 38:19.333
I think, isn't supportive
to them because,

38:19.333 --> 38:22.533
for a lot of people,
surgery isn't perfect.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.433
You never have a perfect body.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.667
YOU SAID WHEN KIDS
MAKE A STATEMENT,

38:26.667 --> 38:28.900
AND YOU SAID
STATEMENT, SINGULAR.

38:28.900 --> 38:32.067
HOWEVER, MOST TRANSGENDER KIDS
MAKE STATEMENTS OVER TIME.

38:32.067 --> 38:35.900
I wish I had a magic wand
that could allow me to say

38:35.900 --> 38:38.933
who is a pure trans person.

38:38.933 --> 38:42.233
We're trying to find out
how much of this

38:42.233 --> 38:46.067
is like some of these things
that you get hooked onto

38:46.067 --> 38:49.667
and then you drop and move
onto something else.

38:49.667 --> 38:54.100
DR. BRADLEY, HAD I BROUGHT
LITTLE JAZZ TO YOU

38:54.100 --> 38:56.867
AT THE AGE OF 3
WHERE SHE WAS SAYING,

38:56.867 --> 38:59.767
"I AM A GIRL. I'M A GIRL, MOMMY.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,"

38:59.767 --> 39:02.267
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
TOLD ME AS A PARENT?

39:02.267 --> 39:06.433
If we did anything, it would be
gentle discouragement.

39:06.433 --> 39:09.567
I THINK ANY TRANS PERSON
CAN TELL YOU

39:09.567 --> 39:12.300
THAT SOCIETY ALREADY PROVIDES

39:12.300 --> 39:15.800
AN AMPLE AMOUNT
OF MORE-THAN-GENTLE
DISCOURAGEMENT

39:15.800 --> 39:18.900
TOWARDS THOSE WHO ARE TRANS
AND ARE OUT AS TRANS.

39:18.900 --> 39:22.200
IT IS COMPLETELY NOT OKAY
TO PREVENT A TRANSGENDER CHILD

39:22.200 --> 39:23.900
FROM DOING
WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY,

39:23.900 --> 39:26.667
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA
OF GENTLE DISCOURAGEMENT

39:26.667 --> 39:28.133
WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT

39:28.133 --> 39:30.167
THE LIVES OF SO MANY
TRANSGENDER YOUTH.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.667
Jazz:
WHEN YOU SAID IT'S PREFERABLE

39:31.667 --> 39:33.900
FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE
TO GO THROUGH PUBERTY,

39:33.900 --> 39:36.833
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S COMPARABLE
TO A FORM OF TORTURE.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.267
IF I HAD TO GO
THROUGH MALE PUBERTY,

39:39.267 --> 39:41.400
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHERE I WOULD BE.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.467
I'M NOT SURE
IF I WOULD BE ALIVE.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.500
WHEN YOU START TO INTERVENE
IN A TRANSGENDER CHILD'S LIFE,

39:46.500 --> 39:47.967
WHAT ARE WE INTERVENING FOR?

39:47.967 --> 39:51.333
ARE WE TRYING TO PREVENT THIS
PERSON FROM MAKING A MISTAKE?

39:51.333 --> 39:54.267
I'm not a doubter in terms
of the benefits

39:54.267 --> 39:57.567
of transitioning
for some people.

39:57.567 --> 40:00.267
The problem is which people.

40:00.267 --> 40:04.667
I FEEL LIKE, AS DOCTORS
AND SCIENTISTS,

40:04.667 --> 40:07.533
IT'S NOT YOUR ROLE
TO DETERMINE THOSE DECISIONS.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.767
WE SHOULD BE FINDING
THE PERSISTERS,

40:09.767 --> 40:11.500
GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT
AND LOVE THEY NEED,

40:11.500 --> 40:13.933
AND ALLOWING THEM
TO TRANSITION AND BE HAPPY,

40:13.933 --> 40:15.767
AND THEY KNOW THE ANSWER.

40:15.767 --> 40:18.100
AND AS DOCTORS,
YOU'RE THERE TO GUIDE THEM

40:18.100 --> 40:19.767
AND HELP THEM
DOWN THAT PATH.

40:19.767 --> 40:23.100
Jeanette:
I SPEAK TO HUNDREDS OF PARENTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

40:23.100 --> 40:25.467
THEIR SITUATIONS ARE
VERY SIMILAR TO JAZZ'S,

40:25.467 --> 40:27.267
AND I WATCH
THESE KIDS' PROGRESS,

40:27.267 --> 40:29.200
AND I DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
WAKING UP ONE DAY

40:29.200 --> 40:31.400
AND BEING LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
CHANGED MY MIND."

40:31.400 --> 40:33.267
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT A PARENT
KNOWS THEIR KID

40:33.267 --> 40:35.333
BETTER THAN A BUNCH
OF STATISTICS

40:35.333 --> 40:38.300
BASED ON STUDIES THAT HAD,
LIKE, 100 PEOPLE IN THEM.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.467
Paul:
WELL, DR. BRADLEY,

40:39.467 --> 40:40.867
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.100
GREAT DISCUSSION.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.233
I DON'T THINK WE'VE COME
TO A CONCLUSION

40:44.233 --> 40:46.433
BUT I THANK YOU
FOR CALLING INTO "THE QIEW."

40:46.433 --> 40:47.400
You're welcome.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.933
OKAY.
THERE WE GO.

40:48.933 --> 40:50.100
Jennifer: SO, JODIE,
AFTER ALL THIS DISCUSSION,

40:50.100 --> 40:51.267
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

40:51.267 --> 40:52.933
ARE YOU STILL ON THE FENCE
ABOUT HORMONES?

40:52.933 --> 40:54.167
ARE YOU...

40:54.167 --> 40:56.533
THIS DISCUSSION MADE ME POINT
RIGHT BACK TO PENELOPE.

40:56.533 --> 40:58.700
MY JOB IS TO ASK PENELOPE

40:58.700 --> 41:01.467
HOW HE'S FEELING ABOUT
HIMSELF AND HIS BODY,

41:01.467 --> 41:03.067
AND THAT WILL LEAD ME
TO THE ANSWERS

41:03.067 --> 41:05.400
BECAUSE THERE'S RESEARCH
AND THERE'S OPINIONS,

41:05.400 --> 41:08.067
AND THEN THERE'S WHAT
HAPPENS IN YOUR HOME.

41:08.067 --> 41:09.967
Jodie:
PENELOPE IS NOT A STATISTIC,

41:09.967 --> 41:11.533
AND I WILL HAVE
TO MOVE WITH PENELOPE

41:11.533 --> 41:13.067
AS PENELOPE MOVES THROUGH LIFE,

41:13.067 --> 41:17.933
AND SO IF IT BECAME SO DIFFICULT
FOR PENELOPE TO LIVE,

41:17.933 --> 41:20.967
THEN, YES, WE WOULD TAKE
THAT GINORMOUS LEAP.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.167
Jazz:
SOMEONE WHO SUGGESTS

41:22.167 --> 41:25.133
THAT GENDER DYSPHORIA
IS A PASSING PHASE,

41:25.133 --> 41:27.433
I REALLY WANT TO TELL THEM
THAT THE HORMONE BLOCKERS

41:27.433 --> 41:29.433
CHANGED AND SAVED MY LIFE,

41:29.433 --> 41:30.800
AND I AM A WOMAN,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.067
AND IF I WANT TO GO
THROUGH A MEDICAL PROCESS

41:34.067 --> 41:35.333
THAT ALLOWS ME TO BE A WOMAN

41:35.333 --> 41:37.567
AND IT'LL MAKE ME MORE
COMFORTABLE IN MY SKIN,

41:37.567 --> 41:39.400
THEN YOU SHOULD BE
OKAY WITH THAT.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.600
Paul:
FOR ALL OF US AT "THE QIEW,"

41:40.600 --> 41:42.067
WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR JOINING US TODAY,

41:42.067 --> 41:43.700
AND WE'LL SEE YOU
NEXT TIME ON OUR SHOW.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.667
BYE, EVERYBODY.
-THANK YOU.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.733
-THANKS, GUYS.
-BYE.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.833
NEXT TIME ON "I AM JAZZ"...

41:49.833 --> 41:51.200
It's possible that Dr. Ting

41:51.200 --> 41:53.067
is going to recommend
the tissue expander.

41:53.067 --> 41:54.867
I've made arrangements
for the O.R.

41:54.867 --> 41:56.333
in case we choose to do it.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.067
Jazz:
I HAVE TO HEAD TO NEW YORK
FOR ANOTHER CONSULTATION.

42:00.067 --> 42:03.133
THIS IS MY BODY, YOU KNOW?
I'M SCARED.

42:03.133 --> 42:05.367
IF YOU END UP HAVING
THE EXPANDERS,

42:05.367 --> 42:07.233
I THINK YOU END UP
NEEDING A GAP YEAR.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.833
I CAN HEAR THE UNDERLYING
EXCITEMENT IN YOUR VOICE

42:09.833 --> 42:11.133
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR WAY.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.900
GETTING HIS WAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42:12.900 --> 42:14.567
IS IT TRUE
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME

42:14.567 --> 42:16.433
TO GET THE SURGERY
UNTIL I'M AN ADULT?

42:16.433 --> 42:18.600
IS IT TRUE?

42:18.600 --> 42:21.767
WE HAVE TO PUT A NEEDLE THROUGH
THE SKIN IN THE SCROTUM,

42:21.767 --> 42:24.067
INTO THE EXPANDER,
AND INJECT SALINE INTO IT.

42:24.067 --> 42:26.333
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

42:26.333 --> 42:27.600
AFTER EXAMINING YOU,

42:27.600 --> 42:29.500
AS FAR AS A TISSUE EXPANDER
IS CONCERNED...

42:29.500 --> 42:31.400
