00:03.500 --> 00:06.500
Downfall of a Droid

00:07.000 --> 00:09.500
Written by George Krstic
Directed by Rob Coleman

00:16.900 --> 00:21.099
After suffering a series of disastrous defeats
at the hands of General Grievous,

00:21.100 --> 00:24.599
the Republic's foothold in the
Outer Rim is in jeopardy.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.449
Commissioned to protect the
strategic world of Bothawui,

00:27.450 --> 00:29.818
Anakin Skywalker and his weary battle group

00:29.819 --> 00:33.819
are all that stands between the system
and domination by the droid army....

00:39.798 --> 00:43.067
Among our most recent losses
was the battle group at Falleen.

00:43.068 --> 00:46.679
The Separatist fleet commanded
by General Grievous is headed your way.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.589
Seems like that coward always knows
where and when to attack us.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.326
You're heavily outnumbered, Anakin.

00:51.327 --> 00:52.519
I advise retreat.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.395
If we run,

00:53.396 --> 00:55.472
the Separatists will
take control of this sector.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.736
I can't let them do that.

00:56.737 --> 00:58.189
And that is your problem.

00:58.190 --> 00:59.684
Master Kenobi is right.

00:59.695 --> 01:00.968
We should regroup.

01:00.969 --> 01:02.471
We don't stand a chance against...

01:02.472 --> 01:03.111
Ahsoka.

01:03.112 --> 01:05.595
Suicide is not the Jedi way, Master.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.407
You should listen to your Padawan.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.616
As you listened to yours,
my old Master?

01:09.627 --> 01:11.795
No, we are going to stay and fight.

01:11.796 --> 01:14.485
And I think I know how to
beat Grievous at his own game.

01:25.427 --> 01:27.327
Our spies were right, General.

01:27.328 --> 01:30.656
The Jedi have positioned a fleet
beyond the planetary rings.

01:36.799 --> 01:40.728
Move our ships through
the asteroid field to engage them.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.091
Through the field, sir?

01:43.092 --> 01:44.919
If we attack from above,

01:44.920 --> 01:46.834
they will have the advantage.

01:46.859 --> 01:49.816
So we will go through the rocks.

01:57.359 --> 01:59.171
That didn't sound good.

01:59.172 --> 02:02.190
All power to the forward shields.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.676
What if they attack us from behind?

02:05.379 --> 02:06.634
They can't.

02:06.635 --> 02:09.287
The asteroids will protect us.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.889
Gold Squadron, tighten formation.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.899
Slow approach. Let's draw them in.

02:24.900 --> 02:25.750
Yes, sir.

02:26.499 --> 02:27.699
Don't worry, R2.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.179
Grievous is falling right into our trap.

02:38.799 --> 02:40.754
Resolute command to Gold Leader.

02:40.755 --> 02:42.059
We are standing by.

02:42.090 --> 02:43.785
Enemy closing to zone six.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.658
Patience, Ahsoka.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.499
Zone four.
Zone three.

02:51.549 --> 02:54.449
General, we have a clear shot
at their cruisers.

02:54.450 --> 02:57.189
Good. Good!

02:58.899 --> 03:00.074
They're right on top of us.

03:00.075 --> 03:01.059
Should we commence firing?

03:01.060 --> 03:03.299
Wait. Wait.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.809
Concentrate fire on
the closest Republic cruiser.

03:06.810 --> 03:08.010
Roger, roger.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.699
We're outgunned.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.005
We're not gonna last
a mynock minute out here.

03:22.149 --> 03:23.314
Hang on, Ahsoka.

03:23.315 --> 03:24.714
We've got em' right where we want em'.

03:27.099 --> 03:28.944
Watch your stabilizer, Gold Six!

03:34.967 --> 03:36.794
It's no good. Incoming's too heavy.

03:39.899 --> 03:41.649
Gold Squadron, take evasive action.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.569
Sir, yes, sir.

03:42.579 --> 03:43.342
Breaking off.

03:46.899 --> 03:49.035
No, R2, we're not retreating.

03:49.036 --> 03:50.769
Good thing you gave us
that extra power.

03:54.444 --> 03:56.219
Let's finish them off!

03:59.399 --> 04:01.199
Ahsoka, they're in position.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.799
Unveil our little surprise.

04:02.824 --> 04:03.952
Right away, Master.

04:03.953 --> 04:06.354
Rex, old boy,
it's time you joined the party.

04:06.355 --> 04:07.920
With pleasure, sir.

04:17.499 --> 04:19.649
General, we've been outflanked.

04:20.688 --> 04:22.244
All units, fire at will.

04:28.099 --> 04:29.497
Impossible!

04:30.137 --> 04:32.111
Forward cannon, let em' have it.

04:38.999 --> 04:40.366
This is too easy.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.449
Get us out of here!

04:48.804 --> 04:51.214
Uh, where are we supposed to go?

04:53.949 --> 04:55.199
Uh, General?

04:55.499 --> 04:57.788
Well, I guess I'm in charge now.

05:17.156 --> 05:18.152
Grievous!

05:22.999 --> 05:24.328
Let's finish this.

05:24.819 --> 05:27.699
All batteries,
target that command bucket.

05:34.164 --> 05:36.129
He's powering up his hyperdrive, R2.

05:36.130 --> 05:36.650
Hang on.

05:39.699 --> 05:41.099
More speed, R2.

05:43.429 --> 05:44.998
See what you can do
about that, buddy.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.798
I got a bad feeling about this.

06:14.325 --> 06:15.325
What happened?

06:15.425 --> 06:17.925
You owe Rexster your skin, Skyguy.

06:17.926 --> 06:19.455
Just doing my job, sir.

06:19.456 --> 06:21.108
It was your plan that won the day.

06:21.110 --> 06:22.495
Grievous is awol,

06:22.496 --> 06:25.575
but his fleet of tinnies
is nothing but spare parts.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.005
Good work, both of you.

06:28.105 --> 06:29.565
Where is R2?

06:29.585 --> 06:31.595
I'm sorry, Master.

06:31.596 --> 06:32.565
He is gone.

06:37.675 --> 06:39.271
Congratulations, Anakin.

06:39.272 --> 06:41.554
Your resourcefulness always amazes me.

06:41.555 --> 06:42.890
Thank you, Master.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.352
You look troubled.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.560
I lost R2 in the field.

06:46.561 --> 06:49.244
Well, R2 units are a dime a dozen.

06:49.245 --> 06:51.520
I'm sure you'll find
a suitable replacement.

06:51.521 --> 06:53.430
I could take a squad out there,
track him down.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.825
Anakin. It's only a droid.

06:55.826 --> 06:58.505
You know attachment
is not acceptable for a Jedi.

06:58.506 --> 06:59.701
It's not just that, Master.

07:00.185 --> 07:01.971
Uh, how do I put this?

07:02.675 --> 07:04.860
I didn't wipe R2's memory.

07:04.861 --> 07:05.861
What?

07:05.862 --> 07:09.264
He's still programmed with
our tactics and base locations?

07:09.265 --> 07:11.398
If the Separatists get a hold of him...

07:11.400 --> 07:14.852
What possessed you not to
erase that droid's memory?

07:14.853 --> 07:15.855
Master Obi-Wan,

07:15.856 --> 07:19.735
sometimes R2 having that
extra information has come in handy.

07:19.736 --> 07:22.473
Well, then find that droid, Anakin.

07:22.474 --> 07:24.965
Our necks might very well depend on it.

07:24.966 --> 07:25.868
Right away, Master.

07:37.675 --> 07:39.151
You ready to go, Snips?

07:39.152 --> 07:42.882
Master, they just delivered
your replacement astromech droid.

07:42.883 --> 07:45.085
This is R3-S6.

07:48.175 --> 07:52.313
I've heard that the new R3s
are far faster in thinking skills

07:52.314 --> 07:54.880
and more powerful than the old R2 units.

07:56.985 --> 07:58.242
And best of all, Master,

07:58.275 --> 07:59.375
he is gold.

07:59.376 --> 08:03.897
A gold droid for Gold Leader
of Gold Squadron.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.846
You can't replace R2.

08:06.675 --> 08:09.233
Don't worry, Goldie.
You'll get to know him later.

08:09.234 --> 08:10.217
Come on.

08:20.275 --> 08:21.065
There's my ship.

08:28.475 --> 08:29.415
R2 is gone.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.928
He must have escaped.

08:30.929 --> 08:32.381
He's got to be around here somewhere.

08:32.974 --> 08:35.072
R2 isn't on the scanners.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.565
But there is a ship out there.

08:39.845 --> 08:41.845
[ Vulture's Claw ]

08:43.658 --> 08:45.535
Looks like a Trandoshan scavenger,

08:45.536 --> 08:47.692
probably combing
the battlefield for salvage.

08:48.275 --> 08:49.605
The historical texts say...

08:49.606 --> 08:51.905
Archive texts can only teach you
a part of the picture,

08:51.906 --> 08:52.840
my young Padawan.

08:52.841 --> 08:55.398
You'll learn a lot more
through some hands-on experience.

09:04.020 --> 09:07.177
Ugh! What's that smell?

09:08.915 --> 09:10.111
You'll get used to it.

09:17.804 --> 09:20.074
Hey, we'd like to buy a droid.

09:20.075 --> 09:20.954
You sellin'?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.440
We're looking for an R2 unit.

09:37.441 --> 09:39.060
You happen to pick up any recently?

09:39.061 --> 09:41.128
An "R" series?

09:41.129 --> 09:44.325
No, no, not for a long time.

09:44.326 --> 09:48.656
"Pookums" here really has
her heart set on another R2.

09:48.657 --> 09:50.075
She lost the last one.

09:50.076 --> 09:51.251
Pookums?

09:51.285 --> 09:52.675
Oh, brother.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.092
Nice R3 unit.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.581
Trade for a C-14?

09:57.887 --> 09:59.765
Not on your life, lizardo.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.695
Now let's see how much I have here.

10:02.542 --> 10:03.949
I tell you what.

10:03.950 --> 10:07.975
I may have an R2 unit
buried somewhere in the hold.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.732
Help yourself.
But be careful.

10:12.735 --> 10:16.325
There are many, um,
unique items down here.

10:34.810 --> 10:35.940
Master?

10:39.985 --> 10:43.015
These must be the unique items
we were warned about.

10:43.016 --> 10:45.675
These assassin droids
can be very unpredictable.

10:45.676 --> 10:46.771
They're switched off.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.247
They don't look so tough to me.

10:48.325 --> 10:49.845
Nothing looks tough to you.

10:49.846 --> 10:52.213
Take my word for it:
they're deadly.

10:58.275 --> 11:01.825
R3, access the computer
and find the inventory manifest.

11:01.826 --> 11:03.855
R2's gotta be around here somewhere.

11:10.023 --> 11:11.175
Did you hear that?

11:11.176 --> 11:12.176
Hear what?

11:12.177 --> 11:13.412
That sounded like R2.

11:13.413 --> 11:14.907
How can you tell the difference?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.195
It came from down here.

11:16.196 --> 11:17.754
R3, get this open.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.275
We don't need the lights on!

11:23.276 --> 11:25.161
No, Goldie. The hatch.

11:25.165 --> 11:26.961
Never mind.
I'll do it myself.

11:40.875 --> 11:41.735
Master!

11:46.851 --> 11:48.801
Goldie, shut these droids down!

11:52.675 --> 11:55.285
I'm afraid R3 is a little slow
on the uptake.

12:13.825 --> 12:15.655
Back at you, piston head.

12:29.275 --> 12:31.872
You were right about
the hands-on experience, gramps.

12:31.873 --> 12:33.585
Much better than the archives.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.010
Good job, but you missed one.

12:40.065 --> 12:41.940
As for you, Stubby,

12:41.941 --> 12:43.975
you'd make a poor excuse
for a light switch.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.074
I'm sure he did his best.

12:47.075 --> 12:48.262
His best to get us killed?

12:48.375 --> 12:50.480
R2 would have never
made that mistake.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.459
R3 can't even get the door open.

12:56.325 --> 12:57.927
A little late, Stubby.

13:01.140 --> 13:05.085
If you didn't have a lightsaber,
you'd be a dead man.

13:05.475 --> 13:06.625
Where's my droid?

13:06.625 --> 13:07.922
Master, what are you doing?

13:07.923 --> 13:09.400
R2's not here.

13:13.465 --> 13:14.741
Let's get out of here.

13:15.412 --> 13:18.658
I told you there were no
R2 droids down here.

13:19.856 --> 13:21.643
Look at this mess you made!

13:22.135 --> 13:24.205
You owe me, Jedi.

13:27.025 --> 13:30.225
You'll be sorry you ever
came aboard my ship, Jedi.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.556
I'm about to make your life miserable.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.175
What is it?

13:35.176 --> 13:38.185
I'm en route to the rendezvous point,
General.

13:38.186 --> 13:41.455
I've got the merchandise
you were looking for.

13:44.075 --> 13:45.744
It must be valuable.

13:45.745 --> 13:48.531
A Jedi came looking for it.

13:48.532 --> 13:52.454
Maybe it is worth more
than we negotiated.

13:52.455 --> 13:54.464
Don't push me, slime.

13:54.465 --> 13:58.035
You bring that R2 unit to me
as fast as you can get here...

13:58.036 --> 13:59.675
Or else...

13:59.676 --> 14:02.385
Ah, yes, of course, General.

14:02.386 --> 14:03.496
Just kidding.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.170
We have to assume that R2 was destroyed
in the explosion that claimed your ship.

14:12.630 --> 14:13.420
Yes, Master.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.590
Our intelligence has confirmed that Grievous'
spies have been intercepting our transmissions.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.950
He must have some sort of secret
listening post out there somewhere.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.420
That would explain how
he's been able to ambush our fleets.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.508
Split up your squadrons, Anakin.

14:25.509 --> 14:27.979
Find that base and destroy it.

14:27.980 --> 14:29.670
It's as good as done, Master Kenobi.

14:30.050 --> 14:31.785
May the Force be with you both.

14:35.190 --> 14:38.130
I'll sweep the outer corridor
while the rest of your ships focus on the center.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.170
Are you sure you want to go it alone?

14:40.300 --> 14:43.310
I'm sure. More than one fighter
will just draw too much attention.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.160
Yes, sir.

14:44.420 --> 14:47.240
Master, you'll need a droid
to help you navigate.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.940
I think Stubby is defective.

14:49.390 --> 14:50.730
Give him another chance, Master.

14:51.150 --> 14:55.160
This is the perfect time for you
and him to, you know, bond.

14:58.580 --> 14:59.385
All right.

15:00.390 --> 15:01.400
Come on, Stubby.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.980
May the Force be with you, Master.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.275
Removed your restraing bolt, have you?

16:23.285 --> 16:25.000
What were you up to?

16:27.850 --> 16:30.640
R3, have you verified those
coordinates on the search grid?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.440
Okay, let's see what we can find.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.340
Activate long-range scanners.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.320
No, not the tracking beacon!

16:45.620 --> 16:47.380
Shut it down, R3. Shut it down.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.700
That's Master Skywalker's tracking beacon.

16:54.070 --> 16:54.890
What's he doing?

16:55.290 --> 16:57.500
Rex, get a hold of as many men as you can.

16:57.785 --> 16:58.585
Right away, sir!

17:03.860 --> 17:06.420
There's our Jedi tracking beacon.

17:07.880 --> 17:12.560
Skywalker, now you have fallen into my trap.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.430
Why do I have to do everything?

17:17.280 --> 17:18.920
Let's hope Grievous didn't hear that.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.170
Yeah, he heard it.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.050
Time to leave.

17:31.590 --> 17:33.880
Plot a course out of here
and prep the hyperdrive engines.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.259
What are you doing?

17:39.260 --> 17:40.850
I said "prep them" not "drop them".

17:49.650 --> 17:50.940
Where's R2 when I need him?

17:51.260 --> 17:52.910
Launch everything we have.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.435
Sir, it's only one fighter.
He can't escape.

17:56.660 --> 17:57.740
Everything!

18:11.490 --> 18:13.385
I know, I know! Missiles.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.275
I hate missiles.

18:15.276 --> 18:17.059
We're going on the offensive, R3.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.420
Get ready to cut the engines.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.230
Will you just do what I tell you?

18:27.490 --> 18:28.850
Hit the stabilizers, R3.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.350
Hey, that was clever.

18:36.580 --> 18:37.616
Silence!

18:37.677 --> 18:40.440
Move the cruisers into attack position!

18:42.530 --> 18:43.498
All right, R3.

18:43.499 --> 18:45.884
Let's get turned around
before those fighters catch up to us.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.040
You know, if this ship
blows up, you go with it.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.180
What do you mean the laser guns won't fire?

19:07.890 --> 19:10.570
Cargo bay doors open.
You better get inside.

19:10.571 --> 19:14.000
I'd love to, but R3's
having a problem with the engines.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.970
Destroy those ships!
Don't let them get away!

19:24.800 --> 19:26.530
Let's give him some cover, boys.

19:26.585 --> 19:27.485
Yes, sir!

19:34.685 --> 19:36.260
Steady. Almost there.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.300
I'm inside. Now let's
get out of here, Ahsoka.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.971
Power it up, Rex.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.670
We're going right between those tin cans.

19:58.450 --> 19:59.610
Hit it, Rex.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.840
Uh... They got away, Sir.

20:16.230 --> 20:17.106
Hey, Goldie!

20:17.107 --> 20:19.500
What did you think of your first adventure?

20:19.501 --> 20:20.640
I'll tell you what I think.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.540
I think I'm lucky to be alive.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.690
Great, now you hurt his feelings.

20:28.870 --> 20:31.020
His feelings? What about R2?

20:34.710 --> 20:36.835
He's still out there. I know it.

21:17.980 --> 21:24.150
