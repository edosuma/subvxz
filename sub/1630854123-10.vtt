WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:04.838
[pop music playing
indistinctly]

00:04.905 --> 00:07.441
- One margherita,
one meat lover's,

00:07.508 --> 00:10.211
and one mushroom
with pineapple,

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
which should be illegal.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.414
- I'll shoot them
a really dirty look for you

00:13.481 --> 00:14.782
when I drop them off.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.617
- Ah. Would you?

00:16.684 --> 00:17.585
Hey.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.952
Shutting down the phone soon.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.089
Should be your last run.
You wanna come over after?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.623
- I don't know.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.192
Are you gonna let me
pick the movie this time?

00:24.258 --> 00:26.194
- Oh, I thought you liked
the horror movie marathon.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.661
You liked "Cabin in the Woods."

00:27.728 --> 00:30.198
- I liked Chris Hemsworth.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.199
- Ouch.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.466
- I'm kidding.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.502
Yeah, I'd be up
for a movie night.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.003
Might take me an hour, though.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.538
These deliveries are all over.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.440
- No rush.
I'll be here.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.679
- I'll call you when
I'm on my way back.

00:45.746 --> 00:46.680
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.921
[indistinct chatter]

00:53.987 --> 00:57.024
[horns honking]
[distant sirens wailing]

01:10.938 --> 01:13.841
[ominous music]

01:13.907 --> 01:20.848
* *

01:48.542 --> 01:51.212
- Hey, there you are.
- Come see my new place.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.547
[indistinct chatter]

01:53.614 --> 02:00.721
* *

02:15.503 --> 02:17.838
- [screaming]

02:21.642 --> 02:27.481
* *

02:27.548 --> 02:28.549
- Thanks for coming
all the way out.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.850
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.118
We hear you have a
possible abduction.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.221
- Yeah, we found the car
early this morning.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.356
Registration came back
to a pizza place in the city.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.824
Apparently, both the car
and the driver

02:36.890 --> 02:38.726
were reported missing
late last night.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.261
- What do you know
about the driver?

02:40.328 --> 02:42.963
- 22-year-old delivery girl
named Chloe Rogers.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.465
Guy who called it in said
she went out for her last run

02:44.532 --> 02:45.699
a little before midnight.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.501
Never made any of her stops.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.869
Pizzas are still in the car.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.705
- All of her delivery addresses
are within

02:51.772 --> 02:53.407
two miles of the pizza place.

02:53.474 --> 02:57.511
- So why the hell'd she end up
an hour outside the city?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.946
Uh, you find
any personal effects?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.180
Phone, ID, wallet?

03:00.248 --> 03:01.649
- No bag or wallet,
but her cell phone

03:01.715 --> 03:03.016
was left in the cup holder.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.655
- Okay, let's get a K-9 unit
to search the surrounding area.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.023
We could find a body
somewhere out there.

03:10.090 --> 03:15.062
* *

03:15.128 --> 03:19.166
- OA, there's a secondary set
of tire tracks.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.734
- Okay. Thank you.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.740
- All right, folks.
Let's get into it.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.175
We have a missing
persons case--

03:28.242 --> 03:30.578
22-year-old Chloe Rogers,
delivery driver

03:30.644 --> 03:32.546
for Luna Pizza in Chelsea.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.214
She left work driving
the company car

03:34.282 --> 03:36.083
at around 11:55 p.m.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.486
Uh, the car was found
this morning an hour away.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.787
The question is, where's Chloe?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.355
Was she with the car
when it was abandoned,

03:41.422 --> 03:43.424
or was she carjacked
before it even left the city?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.526
- Carjacking isn't
a bad theory.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.962
ERT found damage on the car's
passenger side door handle.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.631
Thinks someone was trying
to break in with a screwdriver.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.232
- All right, that's--
that's something.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.101
- Although how many
car thieves do you know

03:54.167 --> 03:56.604
wanna steal
a pizza delivery vehicle?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.306
- Right. Have we heard
from Maggie and OA?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.840
- Yeah, just talked to them.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.709
The area is pretty deserted,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.243
so they're not having
much luck with witnesses.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.245
But they did send over
footage from the gas station

04:05.313 --> 04:06.947
up the road.
- Ooh.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.749
- Check this out.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.320
Timestamps puts this
at 12:42 a.m.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.154
- Can you zoom in on that car?

04:20.193 --> 04:22.229
Well, that confirms
the abduction theory.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.664
Can we get an ID from that?

04:23.731 --> 04:26.233
- Uh, no.
It's too dark for facial rec.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.535
- Can we find another angle?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.569
Get him coming back
the other way?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.003
- No, I checked.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.171
Wherever they went
after ditching the car,

04:31.238 --> 04:32.640
they didn't pass
the gas station again.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.808
- Okay, well,
if the evidence won't help us,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.243
maybe the victim can.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.879
What do we know about her?
- Uh, not a lot.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.814
We're actually having trouble
finding information.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.583
We don't have
an official ID yet,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.852
and there's no online presence.

04:44.918 --> 04:45.786
- Well, somebody's
gotta know her.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.120
Who reported her missing?

04:47.187 --> 04:48.656
- Uh, a coworker
from the pizza place.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.890
Ben Miller.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.659
Scola and Tiffany
are talking to him now.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.961
[suspenseful music]

04:54.027 --> 04:56.430
- My dad hired Chloe to work
with us about six months ago,

04:56.497 --> 04:59.467
and we started dating
pretty soon after that.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.001
But she's a great
girl, you know?

05:01.068 --> 05:02.670
I mean, she wouldn't
just disappear like this.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.171
- Yeah.
We're not doubting that.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.773
Can you tell us what
happened last night?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.174
- Um, I don't know.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.709
She was supposed
to be back after her run

05:08.776 --> 05:10.444
to drop the car off.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.746
When she wasn't back by 1:00,
I started getting worried.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.448
- Okay, and you were here
the whole time?

05:14.515 --> 05:15.916
Cameras will confirm that?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.818
- Yeah.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.720
What, you don't think
I did anything to Chloe?

05:19.787 --> 05:20.654
- You were the last one
to see her.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.855
We just have to ask.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.724
- Yeah, I get it,
but I would never.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.559
Look, we haven't been
together for a long time,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.327
but I really do care about her.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.329
- Good. Help us find her.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.798
- You know anything
about her background?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.099
- What do you mean?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.333
- Well, we're having trouble
tracking down

05:33.401 --> 05:34.735
her family, for one,

05:34.802 --> 05:36.136
so she ever say
anything about them?

05:36.203 --> 05:38.171
- I think it was
just her and her dad.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.740
But she didn't really
talk about him a lot.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.675
I got the feeling they didn't
have the best relationship.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.210
- How so?
- I don't know.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.013
Any time I'd mention him,
she'd just change the subject.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.749
I think she came to New York
for a fresh start, you know?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.818
- Where was she from,
originally?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.453
- Upstate, around Poughkeepsie.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.154
- You know her dad's name?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.957
- No. Sorry.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.959
- We're gonna do everything
we can to track down Chloe,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.028
but we need more information.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.663
I mean, she worked
for your dad, right?

06:02.730 --> 06:03.864
He must have some paperwork
on her.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.333
A W-4 or a driver's license?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.835
- I don't--I don't think so.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.336
- She was an employee here,
wasn't she?

06:09.403 --> 06:13.707
- Yeah, but she didn't have
a bank account set up yet,

06:13.774 --> 06:17.845
so my dad was paying her cash
under the table.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.547
- All right,
you know anyone else

06:19.613 --> 06:22.015
that she was hanging out with,
where she was living,

06:22.082 --> 06:23.350
how she spent her time off?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.753
- I don't think she knew
many people in the city.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.722
She--she was staying
at a youth hostel

06:28.789 --> 06:31.625
a few blocks from here,
Millennial Lodge.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.161
- Chloe's one of
our long-termers.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.930
Been here about six months.
- Is that pretty common?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.766
- Not really, but it happens.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.569
Cheaper than paying
New York rent, I guess.

06:41.635 --> 06:45.506
* *

06:45.573 --> 06:46.740
This is her.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.876
- Okay. Let's see here.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.082
Nothing here.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.584
- Did you know her at all?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.018
- Not really.

06:58.085 --> 07:02.089
I mean, she was nice
but kinda kept to herself.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.324
We do these family
dinners every Friday,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.893
go out afterwards.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.427
Chloe only came once.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.997
I don't think it was
a great experience for her.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.231
- Yeah? Why is that?

07:11.298 --> 07:13.033
- Some guy got
overly interested in her,

07:13.100 --> 07:14.602
followed her back here.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.237
And she's shy, you know.
Didn't know how to handle it.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.807
The guys on staff
had to chase him away.

07:19.873 --> 07:23.043
- When was this?
- About a month ago.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.479
- You all have cameras outside?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.914
- This could be it.

07:26.980 --> 07:31.318
* *

07:31.384 --> 07:32.820
Can we--can we
get sound on this?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.922
- Uh, no. It's video only.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.728
- He clearly has rage issues.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.563
Can we ID him from here?

07:42.630 --> 07:44.965
- Running facial rec now.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.567
Yep. Brett Porter.

07:46.634 --> 07:50.037
20 years old.
He's a business major at NYU.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.773
- All right.
Can we get a current location?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.341
- Can't guarantee
he's there now,

07:54.407 --> 07:56.476
but it looks like he lives in
off-campus student housing.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.049
[rap music playing]

08:02.115 --> 08:05.218
[indistinct chatter]

08:12.425 --> 08:13.794
- Hey!

08:15.495 --> 08:16.530
- FBI.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.865
We're not here to
bust your party,

08:17.931 --> 08:19.900
but we need everyone
to stay where they are.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.535
Where are you going?

08:21.602 --> 08:22.536
Sit down.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.173
- Hey. I live here.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.274
Everything okay?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.642
- We're looking
for Brett Porter.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.243
You see him?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.213
- Yeah, uh, I think he went,
um, into his room with a girl.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.953
[suspenseful music]

08:40.020 --> 08:41.922
* *

08:41.989 --> 08:43.223
- Hey, Brett, open up.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.459
- Open it.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.801
- Yo, what the hell?
- Where's the girl?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.468
- In the bathroom.
What's going on?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.674
- You okay?

09:00.741 --> 09:04.477
- Yeah, I--what's happening?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.980
- We have some questions to ask
Brett about a missing girl.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.982
- Hold on.
You can't just barge in here.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.183
- Actually, we can.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.121
- Look, I don't know
what you want me to say.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.388
I don't know anyone
named Chloe.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.758
- Well, it sure seems
like you know her.

09:17.825 --> 09:18.926
- What is this?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.894
- You don't remember?

09:20.961 --> 09:21.995
You met her at the bar.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.997
You followed her to her hostel.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.299
This is you? Yeah?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.168
- Okay.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.436
Yeah.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.139
Look, I'll admit
it wasn't my finest moment.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.074
But that's not Chloe,

09:34.141 --> 09:35.643
whatever you said her name was,
that's Tasha.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.978
- Okay, whatever her name is,
she was abducted last night.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.780
And we have you on video
screaming at her

09:39.847 --> 09:41.281
a few weeks
before she disappeared.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.850
So what happened?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.051
- She rejected you.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.053
You felt embarrassed.
- No. Hold on.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.454
I--I wasn't into Tasha.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.989
- Chloe.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.691
- I'm telling you,
that girl's name is Tasha.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.092
I know her from Poughkeepsie.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.293
- Okay,
are you sure about that?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.929
- Yeah.
She worked for my parents.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.097
Cleaned our house twice a week,

09:57.164 --> 10:00.300
until she robbed us
and took off.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.735
- When was that?

10:01.802 --> 10:04.237
- Last summer. Maybe July?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.539
So when I ran into her,
I confronted her about it.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
But that's it.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.442
That's the last time I saw her.

10:09.509 --> 10:14.748
* *

10:14.815 --> 10:16.283
- Brett Porter alibied out.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.985
He was at a
university fundraiser.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.419
We've got about a dozen
photos confirming it.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.154
- At least that's
something definitive.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.290
- So still no firm ID
on our victim?

10:23.356 --> 10:24.725
- No, and the deeper
we dig into her,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.093
the more questions we have.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.427
You get her toothbrush
to the lab?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.396
- Yeah, they're running
her DNA now.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.664
- Okay.
I know it's a long shot,

10:30.731 --> 10:32.432
but we know she has
a history of theft.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.101
Maybe she's in the
criminal database.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.435
Hey, you talk
to Brett's parents?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.137
- Yeah, they confirmed
Chloe worked for them

10:37.204 --> 10:38.438
under the name Tasha,

10:38.505 --> 10:40.107
and that she stole $2,000
from them.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.441
But they didn't have
much info on her.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.043
Same situation as
the pizza place--

10:43.110 --> 10:44.444
paid her under the table,
didn't even know

10:44.511 --> 10:45.979
her last name.
- Great. All right.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.748
Folks, we should all
be working on this.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.883
This woman did not just
appear out of nowhere.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.251
Let's keep searching
social media.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.053
And hey, Phil, why don't
you get a team together.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.288
Start cold-calling
Poughkeepsie, yeah?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.424
- Hey, Jubal.
That was the lab.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.693
We just got a hit on her DNA.
- So she has a record.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.628
- Not exactly.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.764
She popped in NamUs.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.165
- The missing persons database?

11:05.232 --> 11:08.268
- Real name Annabelle Collier.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.204
She was abducted from
Staten Island at age four,

11:11.271 --> 11:13.106
and presumed dead
for the past 18 years.

11:13.173 --> 11:20.313
* *

11:29.589 --> 11:30.958
- Annabelle Collier was
abducted outside

11:31.024 --> 11:33.293
of a daycare center
back in 2004.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.427
Her mom's a waitress.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.996
Still lives out
in Staten Island.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.231
Her father was a contractor,
but he died of a heart attack.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.532
- In 2008.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.101
- That's--that's right.
How do you--

11:41.168 --> 11:43.470
- The Collier abduction
was one of my first cases

11:43.536 --> 11:45.272
when I joined the bureau.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.707
I kept in contact
with her parents for years

11:47.775 --> 11:49.676
after we closed the case.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.644
Jubal, we got the guy
who took Annabelle.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.780
He confessed to killing her.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.815
- I--I know.
I read the report.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.950
But the DNA is conclusive.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.486
Chloe Rogers and Annabelle
Collier are the same person.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.055
[suspenseful music]

12:02.122 --> 12:04.624
You know, we're kind of
hitting a wall on this one.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.960
I was hoping you could
provide some context.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.395
I guess you
and your old partner

12:08.461 --> 12:11.765
know more about the Collier
case than anyone else.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.102
Maybe you could--are--are you
still in touch with him?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.104
- No. No, not for years.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.006
But he still works
with the FBI,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.141
with Crimes Against Children
in New Haven.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.810
- I can give him a call.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.177
- No, I'll reach out.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.146
It was our case.
He should hear it from me.

12:26.213 --> 12:31.551
* *

12:31.618 --> 12:33.653
[indistinct chatter]

12:33.720 --> 12:35.355
- Hey, stranger.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.723
- Hey.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.525
Thank you for coming
all the way down here.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.960
- It's perfect timing.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.395
It's Angie's week for the
kids, and I was in the city

12:42.462 --> 12:43.530
dropping them off anyway.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.565
Cream, no sugar.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.800
- Thank you.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.535
I actually drink it black now.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.171
Turns out all that cream is not
as healthy as we once thought.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.906
- Don't tell me you've
turned into a health nut.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.775
- [chuckles] No.
- That's no fun.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.177
So what's going on?

12:57.244 --> 13:00.347
You said you got a DNA hit
on Annabelle Collier?

13:00.413 --> 13:03.250
- Yeah, on an abduction case
that we're working.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.353
DNA is a 100% match.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.955
- You sure?
- Positive.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.958
Annabelle's alive,
22 years old.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.193
She's been out there
the whole time.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.429
I--I don't understand how
this could be possible.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.565
I mean, Eddie Lyman
confessed to killing her.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.367
- I guess he was lying.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.635
But that doesn't mean
he wasn't our abductor.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.104
- Really?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.839
Because he's been in prison
for the past 17 years.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.975
- He could have handed
her off to an accomplice

13:28.041 --> 13:31.211
or sold her to some
sex trafficker.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.346
- Whatever happened,
we missed it.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.916
And we stopped looking
for that little girl.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.852
- We worked off the intel
we had at the time.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.857
The important thing is to focus
on the present, okay?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.493
Good news is,

13:46.559 --> 13:48.295
we got another shot at this.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.496
- [sighs] Yeah.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.965
The problem is,
we don't have any leads.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.367
- Well, we may have one.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.837
Apparently Eddie Lyman
beat his case on appeal.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.839
He's been out of prison
for four months.

13:59.907 --> 14:05.112
* *

14:05.178 --> 14:06.379
- Eddie Lyman.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.281
He went to prison back in 2004

14:08.348 --> 14:11.384
for the abduction and murder
of Annabelle Collier.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.320
Annabelle was a
four-year-old little girl

14:13.386 --> 14:16.323
who was taken from a playground
at her daycare center

14:16.389 --> 14:18.926
outside of Staten Island.
- Lyman was her neighbor.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.361
He was in his 20s at the time
and a known predator.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.097
- And according to this, even
before Annabelle went missing,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.499
Lyman served time
for child pornography,

14:26.566 --> 14:27.968
molestation, luring of a minor.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.436
- Right.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.671
Annabelle's mother had
reported him for being creepy.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.007
You know, loitering, leering,

14:34.074 --> 14:35.842
trying to start conversations
with young girls.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.244
- Checked his phone.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.678
Cell records showed him
near the daycare

14:38.745 --> 14:41.081
at the time of the abduction.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.183
Even without his confession,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.018
the case against him was solid.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.853
- So how did he end up
back on the street?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.255
- The public defender
who represented him

14:48.321 --> 14:50.757
was an alcoholic,
disbarred a few years back.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.425
- Ineffective assistance
of counsel.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.928
Lyman was released,
pending a new trial.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.965
- Just in time for Annabelle
to disappear again.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.732
- I just got off the phone
with Lyman's parole officer.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.301
He's working as a janitor
at a place

15:01.368 --> 15:02.535
called the Cameron Motel.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.404
- Okay.
Lyman could be our guy, folks.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.738
Let's get a full team
down there,

15:05.805 --> 15:06.773
ready to search that motel.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.375
- Copy that.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.445
* *

15:12.512 --> 15:14.214
- Lyman has access
to dozens of motel rooms,

15:14.281 --> 15:15.815
and Annabelle could be
in any one of them,

15:15.882 --> 15:17.184
so it's imperative
that we contain him

15:17.250 --> 15:18.685
before he knows we're onsite.
Understood?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.953
agents:
Yes, ma'am.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.854
- Jubal, how are we
looking on your end?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.756
- Yeah, Elise is going
through motel records,

15:23.823 --> 15:25.058
making a list of vacant rooms.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.759
Should have that
to Scola in the next five.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.128
- Copy that.
- All right.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.329
- We'll let you know when
we have eyes on Lyman.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.332
[tense music]

15:32.399 --> 15:39.339
* *

16:09.536 --> 16:10.837
- Hey, look.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.554
Go.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.249
- Eddie Lyman, FBI.
Drop it. Hands up.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.484
- Hey. Hey.
Just take it easy.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.751
Take it easy.

16:58.818 --> 16:59.919
- What are you doing
with that bleach?

16:59.986 --> 17:01.488
- A kid threw up
in one of the bathrooms.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.423
- Where's Annabelle?
- Annabelle?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.125
- The girl you abducted
18 years ago.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.593
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.727
I never touched that girl.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.562
- Get him out of here.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.731
- Wha--come on, man.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.600
You cannot be serious
right now.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.568
- Tiff, we got him. Move in.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.070
- [sighs]
God.

17:17.137 --> 17:24.177
* *

17:24.244 --> 17:26.379
- You got that one.
You guys, come with me.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.454
- I don't know how many times
I have to say it.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.788
I didn't take that girl.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.324
Not yesterday.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.825
Not 18 years ago.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.327
- That's not
what you said back then.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.329
- Yeah, well, I was confused.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.264
He got me all mixed up.
- No.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.433
You were released because
your lawyer was a drunk.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.435
- Yeah, who told me
I get to go home

17:48.501 --> 17:50.337
if I said
what you wanted me to.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.571
I was blindsided.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.673
- We are not here
to re-try your case.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.975
You're gonna get another shot
at that in a few months.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.944
But what do you think
the jury's gonna say

17:58.010 --> 18:00.913
when they find out you didn't
last a year on the outside

18:00.980 --> 18:03.450
without attacking
this poor girl again?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.753
- Why are you doing this?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.555
I don't know this girl.

18:08.621 --> 18:12.525
- We have you on camera
with her last night.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.727
- No. That isn't me.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.962
- Really?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.564
Because that looks a hell
of a lot like

18:17.630 --> 18:19.532
the ring you were wearing
when we picked you up.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.967
Silver band, red stone.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.602
- Okay. Yeah.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.204
It looks like the same ring.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.774
But I ain't the only guy
who has one.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.342
It's a class ring.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.611
Half of Oakwood High
has that same ring.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.646
Guys--guys who lived
in the same neighborhood

18:33.713 --> 18:36.115
as me 18 years ago.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.550
That isn't me.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.954
You got the wrong guy.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.523
Again.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.033
- I wanna go home too, okay?
But that's not how it works.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.303
All right, you're not gonna
go home until you tell me

18:56.369 --> 18:57.937
what you did
with the little girl.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.072
- I already told you.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.676
- You've told me, like,
six different stories, Eddie.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.245
What's going on? Come on.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.146
I need the truth.
[knock at door]

19:07.214 --> 19:08.681
All right. One more time.
Let's take it back.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.317
October 5th.
- Hey.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.551
- Hey.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.853
- So Lyman's alibi checks out.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.156
He was at work at the time
of the abduction.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.425
- Okay.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.627
Thank you.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.595
- What you watching?

19:22.662 --> 19:25.298
- It's Lyman's
original confession.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.801
- From there.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.270
- I went to go see the kids.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.239
They were on the playground,
and--

19:32.305 --> 19:34.173
- You went
to go see Annabelle?

19:34.241 --> 19:35.375
- Yeah.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.643
I saw Annabelle.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.411
- Okay.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.980
Now we're getting somewhere.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.216
- I was at a Quantico
in-service

19:43.283 --> 19:44.984
when Lyman was arrested,

19:45.051 --> 19:46.653
and Jake took
the confession alone.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.855
- Okay. And?

19:48.921 --> 19:51.057
- You can see Ly--
Lyman is unstable.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.492
And Jake is pushing him
really hard,

19:52.559 --> 19:54.060
spinning him upside down.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.162
- Well, you had other evidence
on Lyman, right?

19:56.229 --> 19:58.030
What, the--the cell data.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.600
- Yeah.
I had Ian look into it.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.135
It turns out technology has
come a long way since then.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.872
The carrier overestimated
their ability

20:05.938 --> 20:08.174
to pinpoint the location data.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.376
- Meaning?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.778
- Meaning Lyman
could have been anywhere

20:11.844 --> 20:14.013
within a five-mile radius
of that daycare.

20:14.080 --> 20:18.285
Including at home,
where he said he was.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.019
- Right.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.790
- Jubal,
I buried the wrong guy.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.993
And as a result, we stopped
looking for Annabelle.

20:27.059 --> 20:31.398
[apprehensive music]

20:31.464 --> 20:34.401
[phone buzzes]

20:34.467 --> 20:37.003
- Good news is, we have
better information now.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.273
JOC just got a lead on the ring
our abductor was wearing.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.274
- Okay.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.380
- The class ring that
our present-day abductor

20:47.447 --> 20:48.881
was wearing comes from
the same high school

20:48.948 --> 20:50.350
Lyman attended--Oakwood.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.951
- Which means that the person
we're looking for

20:52.018 --> 20:53.386
is from the same town
where Annabelle Collier

20:53.453 --> 20:54.687
was abducted back in 2004,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.989
which is either
a crazy coincidence, or--

20:57.056 --> 20:59.392
- Or we're looking
for the same abductor.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.594
- Is there any way to track
who bought those rings?

21:01.661 --> 21:02.929
- Yes, we called the company,

21:02.995 --> 21:04.864
and Elise has
the original purchase order.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.933
- There were 36 men
in that graduating class

21:06.999 --> 21:08.668
who ordered rings,
but eliminating anyone

21:08.735 --> 21:10.069
who's passed away
or doesn't match

21:10.136 --> 21:11.504
our abductor's
physical description,

21:11.571 --> 21:12.705
and we're left with six men.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.841
- Right. Okay.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.678
Um, we can bring them in
for questioning?

21:18.745 --> 21:19.912
- I'd hold off--
that part of Staten Island

21:19.979 --> 21:21.147
operates like a small town.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.550
We go in there
without concrete intel,

21:23.616 --> 21:25.251
we risk spooking our perp.
- Right.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.619
All right, let me see
what I can do

21:26.686 --> 21:28.254
to narrow it down from here.
- Okay.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.056
You know, there is one person
from that neighborhood

21:30.122 --> 21:32.091
I think we're safe talking to.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.860
- You wanna go
to the girl's mom?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.562
- If we are looking
for the same guy,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.630
maybe Joan Collier knew him.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.600
[suspenseful music]

21:40.667 --> 21:47.774
* *

21:48.808 --> 21:50.142
- You sure it's her?

21:50.209 --> 21:51.544
- We're positive.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.245
Annabelle's alive.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.149
- Oh, my God.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.887
But I don't--
I don't understand.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.189
You told me--

22:03.255 --> 22:04.824
you told me
Eddie Lyman confessed.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.926
You said he killed her.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.462
- That's what he told us
at the time.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.163
- And you just--

22:11.230 --> 22:13.533
you just took his word for it?

22:13.600 --> 22:14.901
- Well, not exactly.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.336
- My daughter's
been out there for years,

22:17.404 --> 22:19.038
going through God knows what,
because what?

22:19.105 --> 22:21.708
You--you wanted another win
on your record?

22:21.774 --> 22:23.843
You wanted to move on?
You wanted to make it easier?

22:23.910 --> 22:25.378
- I know you're upset.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.446
I get it.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.114
- You get it?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.882
You get what it's like
thinking your daughter

22:29.949 --> 22:31.317
is dead when she's not?

22:33.319 --> 22:35.154
- I'm sorry.
I didn't--I didn't--

22:35.221 --> 22:37.056
I didn't mean it literally.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.092
But we didn't just
take his word for it.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.830
We closed the case on the
totality of the evidence.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.499
And frankly,
revisiting the past

22:46.566 --> 22:49.168
isn't gonna help us
find your daughter now.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.975
Look, this is--
this is good news.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.810
Your daughter is alive.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.680
- You just told me
she was abducted.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.782
Again. How is that good news?

23:02.849 --> 23:05.485
- Because she's breathing.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.287
Alive is better than dead.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.956
It just is.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.257
- This is--
this is unbelievable.

23:11.323 --> 23:14.026
You people act like
I don't have feelings.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.395
That little girl
was my daughter,

23:16.463 --> 23:19.432
and you told me she was dead,
and she's not.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.800
- Joan.

23:22.368 --> 23:24.236
Listen to me.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.174
You have every right
to be upset, to hate us.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.746
But right now, we need your
help to find your daughter.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.448
Annabelle.

23:35.515 --> 23:42.421
* *

23:44.090 --> 23:46.258
Just me and you, okay?

23:59.438 --> 24:05.612
Now, my team has narrowed
it down to six suspects.

24:08.314 --> 24:11.283
They're all from the same area.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.921
They went to the same
high school.

24:17.757 --> 24:24.430
Just let me know if you
recognize any of them.

24:24.497 --> 24:31.437
* *

24:35.441 --> 24:37.009
- That's him.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.444
- Jeff Whalen?
- Yeah.

24:38.511 --> 24:42.949
He, uh--he worked
for my husband.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.586
He was...kind of a sad kid.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.454
He lost his parents young.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.257
A bit of a loner.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.960
- Was he ever around Annabelle?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.662
- Yeah, he was, uh--

24:57.329 --> 25:00.499
He was kind
of attentive to her.

25:00.567 --> 25:04.070
Yeah, and I--
I thought it was sweet,

25:04.136 --> 25:05.237
because he didn't have
a family.

25:05.304 --> 25:09.041
But then he--
he stopped coming around

25:09.108 --> 25:10.509
when Annabelle went missing.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.812
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.446
[sobs]

25:14.513 --> 25:16.115
- Joan.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.217
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.023
- Yeah?

25:25.257 --> 25:27.026
That's what you said last time.

25:27.093 --> 25:34.033
* *

25:34.100 --> 25:35.401
- Anything?

25:35.467 --> 25:36.603
- Yeah.

25:36.669 --> 25:37.804
She ID'd one of them.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.471
Jeff Whalen.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.973
- Good.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.675
Glad you were able
to connect with her.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.111
- Yeah, it's funny
how much easier that is

25:45.177 --> 25:47.113
when you're not trying
to gaslight her.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.015
- Izzy, she was spinning out.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.883
We're working
an abduction case.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.484
Every minute counts.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.922
We don't have time to hold her
hand and beg for forgiveness.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.523
- You don't think
we owe her that?

25:57.590 --> 25:59.592
After what that woman
has been through?

25:59.659 --> 26:03.329
- Like I keep saying, we worked
off the intel that we had.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.664
- So?

26:04.731 --> 26:07.099
How does that help Joan
Collier or her daughter?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.535
- Look, I feel
the same way you do.

26:09.602 --> 26:12.104
But we did the best
that we could.

26:13.539 --> 26:14.473
- Did we?

26:16.042 --> 26:17.143
- What the hell does that mean?

26:17.209 --> 26:19.111
[tense music]

26:19.178 --> 26:22.148
- It means we had a lot
going on back then.

26:24.016 --> 26:27.019
- That had nothing to do
with any of this.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.892
- Seems to me we were
either fighting, or--

26:32.959 --> 26:34.560
- No.

26:34.627 --> 26:35.828
If anything, us being
together helped us

26:35.895 --> 26:38.130
deal with the stress
and the late nights.

26:38.197 --> 26:42.869
Izzy, we were good together.
We were.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.437
We followed the leads that we
had, and they didn't work out.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.774
That's just what
happens sometimes.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.541
Hell, this guy Whalen,

26:49.608 --> 26:52.011
he wasn't even
on our radar back then.

26:52.078 --> 26:57.183
So do yourself a favor
and let it go.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.651
- Let it go?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.019
- Only thing you can do.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.453
- No.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.657
The only thing we can do
is find Annabelle.

27:07.259 --> 27:10.196
This time, anyway.

27:10.262 --> 27:14.433
* *

27:14.500 --> 27:15.601
- All right,
I wanna know everything

27:15.668 --> 27:17.069
there is to know
about Jeff Whalen.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.537
Who he is,
what he's been doing,

27:18.604 --> 27:20.606
who his childhood
best friends are.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.075
- Whalen was born
in Poughkeepsie in 1980.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.443
Only child.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.012
His parents moved him
to Staten Island

27:26.078 --> 27:27.379
when he was in junior high,

27:27.446 --> 27:29.348
but they were both killed
in a car accident

27:29.415 --> 27:30.616
a couple of years later.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.284
Whalen bounced around
foster homes

27:32.351 --> 27:34.520
for the rest of high school
until he turned 18.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.789
- From there,
he started working odd jobs

27:36.856 --> 27:40.392
as a carpenter on Staten Island
up until early 2004.

27:40.459 --> 27:43.062
He pretty much falls off
the grid after that.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.831
- What do you mean?
What--where'd he go?

27:44.897 --> 27:46.365
- No clue.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.434
Last employment on file
was terminated four months

27:48.500 --> 27:49.736
before Annabelle disappeared.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.337
After that, he's a ghost.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.672
- Well, he's supposedly been
living out in the world, right?

27:53.740 --> 27:56.108
- Well, not under that name
or Social Security number.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.543
- You said he was
from Poughkeepsie, right?

27:57.609 --> 27:58.978
- Mm-hmm.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.780
- Well, our victim was
living up there with her dad

28:00.847 --> 28:02.248
under a fake name.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.382
Maybe Whalen's using
a fake name too.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.683
- That's a good idea.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.386
Let's run his photo
through the DMV database.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.822
- Okay, I got something.
Jim Wilson, 42 years old.

28:09.889 --> 28:12.224
Lives in Fairview, 15 minutes
outside of Poughkeepsie.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.093
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's him.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.862
Is this address current?
- I think so.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.097
Property records still
list him as the owner,

28:18.164 --> 28:20.032
and he's still
paying utilities.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.200
- All right,
let's check it out.

28:21.267 --> 28:28.407
* *

28:32.344 --> 28:34.213
- Heads up.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.816
Gray Honda Civic
pulling in now.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.257
- Is that him?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.293
- Hard to tell from here.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.798
He's headed in the house.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.303
- Jeff Whalen! FBI.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.905
We need to talk.
- Set the bag down.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.040
Turn around. Now.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.842
- Okay. Okay.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.376
I'm putting the bag down.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.116
- Who are you?
- Paul Carson.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.184
What do you guys want?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.352
- You live here?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.822
- Yeah, I moved in this fall.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.090
- Where's the guy
who owns this house?

29:18.157 --> 29:19.525
- I don't know.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.960
He left town right around
the time I moved in.

29:21.027 --> 29:25.664
* *

29:32.038 --> 29:34.340
- Yeah.
I knew him as Jim Wilson.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.908
He's lived in town as long
as I've been around.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.277
At least 15 years.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.545
- He live alone?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.313
- No, he's got a daughter.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.482
Probably college age now.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.650
- That her?

29:44.716 --> 29:46.919
- Yeah, Tasha. Nice girl.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.856
A little quiet,
but they both were.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.590
- What was their
relationship like?

29:51.657 --> 29:54.426
Tasha and her father,
based off what you saw?

29:54.493 --> 29:59.798
- They were a little strange,
to be honest with you.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.934
Very insular.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.370
Got the feeling he was
kind of overprotective,

30:04.436 --> 30:08.074
but I guess she broke out
on her own eventually.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.375
- What do you mean, you guess?
- I don't know.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.410
The rumor was that
she ran away.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.711
Left in the middle
of the night.

30:12.778 --> 30:14.613
No note. That kind of thing.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.615
Wilson was pretty
broken up by it.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.185
I figured that's why he
left town, to track her down.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.887
- You know how to get
in contact with him?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.922
- No, that was a part
of the deal

30:22.989 --> 30:24.891
when he agreed to rent me
this place.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.292
I'm paying a reduced rate,

30:26.358 --> 30:28.594
but the upkeep of the house
is on me.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.129
- Where do you send the rent?

30:30.196 --> 30:31.530
- I can get you the address.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.733
It's a PO box in a town
called Nelsonville.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.703
[suspenseful music]

30:37.769 --> 30:43.109
* *

30:43.175 --> 30:44.710
- Hey, Jubal.
- Yeah?

30:44.776 --> 30:46.378
- Yeah, the post office clerk
confirmed

30:46.445 --> 30:47.880
Whalen's been checking
his box regularly

30:47.947 --> 30:48.881
the last five months.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.082
- That--that's great.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.450
Do they know where
he's been staying?

30:51.517 --> 30:52.885
- No, but they have him
on security cameras

30:52.952 --> 30:54.086
driving a green pickup truck.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.287
You'll get the footage soon.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.856
- Yeah, got it.
Downloading it now.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.460
- Okay. Okay.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.531
There's Whalen.

31:05.597 --> 31:12.438
* *

31:12.504 --> 31:14.040
Kelly, can you run
these plates, please?

31:14.106 --> 31:17.509
318, Charlie, Hotel,
Uniform, Romeo.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.211
- Okay.

31:19.278 --> 31:23.115
Green Chevy S-10, purchased
for cash five months ago.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.483
Registered to Jim Wilson.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.452
- Do we have a way
of tracking it?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.120
- It's a 2003 model. No GPS.
- All right.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.888
Let's put a BOLO out
on that vehicle, please.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.257
- I wanna get air support
up there too.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.925
See if we can get eyes
on it from above.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.894
[tense music]

31:35.962 --> 31:43.102
* *

31:50.576 --> 31:52.011
- Maggie, 10 o'clock.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.150
- Hey, Jubal.
We've got eyes on Whalen.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.918
- All right, we got him.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.720
Get Putnam PD over there.
We need backup.

32:01.787 --> 32:08.927
* *

32:30.416 --> 32:32.918
[tires squealing]

32:35.654 --> 32:37.256
- Jubal, Whalen made us.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.590
He's fleeing in that
green pickup truck,

32:38.657 --> 32:40.826
heading east on Main Street.
We're in pursuit.

32:40.892 --> 32:47.566
* *

33:13.125 --> 33:14.693
- Damn it!

33:16.762 --> 33:18.330
- All right, folks,
Jeff Whalen is in the wind,

33:18.397 --> 33:19.665
and he knows we're on to him,

33:19.731 --> 33:21.367
which means we need
to find him, and fast.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.001
Kelly, where are we
with that truck?

33:23.069 --> 33:24.536
- Nothing yet,
but we got the entire

33:24.603 --> 33:26.905
Putnam County Police Department
out there looking for it.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.374
Air support two minutes out.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.042
- Any leads
on where he's going?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.377
- If he's going to the
post office regularly,

33:31.443 --> 33:33.379
he's gotta be living nearby.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.647
- We've been looking at recent
property sales in the area.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.351
There was one about five months
back that stands out.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.087
A small cabin way back
in the woods

33:41.153 --> 33:42.621
on the outskirts of town.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.923
Buyer paid cash the same day
Whalen emptied his accounts

33:44.990 --> 33:46.125
and left Poughkeepsie.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.194
- Was his name on the deed?
- No.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.196
House was purchased under
the name Joe Woodman.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.631
So we're into a bit
of guesswork there.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.834
- Okay, but we know Whalen has
changed his name in the past,

33:55.901 --> 33:57.136
and the initials
are consistent.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.970
Jeff Whalen, Jim Wilson,
Joe Woodman.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.939
- It's gotta be him.
- Yeah.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.674
- Jubal, get SWAT
and both teams over

34:02.741 --> 34:05.277
to that address, now.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.778
- Where are you going?

34:06.845 --> 34:08.447
- To Nelsonville.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.224
[tense music]

34:18.290 --> 34:22.261
* *

34:22.328 --> 34:23.862
- Hey. How's it looking?

34:23.929 --> 34:25.597
- No sign of Whalen, but we're
definitely in the right spot.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.065
Green truck is
parked on the side.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.567
- All right, let's send
a scout to get eyes on him.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.669
But stay out of sight
until we're ready to move in.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.471
- Yes, ma'am.
- Copy.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.873
- Jubal,
Whalen's truck's on site.

34:34.940 --> 34:38.110
I wanna get a team into that
house as soon as possible.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.945
How are you on your side?
- Air support is up.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.547
We have an aerial view
of the property,

34:41.613 --> 34:43.915
and Elise has blueprints
for the house.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.584
- All right.
Can we get a copy to OA?

34:45.651 --> 34:46.985
- Yeah, sending now.

34:47.052 --> 34:48.554
- We've got several acres
of woods

34:48.620 --> 34:49.855
in between you
and the next property.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.223
We need to get that contained.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.559
- How long before we have
the manpower for that?

34:53.625 --> 34:54.660
- Scola and Tiffany
are on their way

34:54.726 --> 34:57.229
with a second SWAT team.

34:57.296 --> 35:00.466
- Isobel, we might
have a problem.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.867
- Jubal, hang on.
What's going on?

35:01.933 --> 35:02.968
- Whalen may know
that we're here.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.536
Scouts got eyes on him.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.972
He retreated into the house,
closed the curtains.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.474
- So much for the element
of surprise.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.142
- So let's switch gears.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.044
Wait for backup, treat it
like a hostage negotiation.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.780
- No, no,
the longer we let this boil,

35:14.846 --> 35:16.248
the worse it gets
for Annabelle.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.016
We've gotta stop him before
he does something rash.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.785
- Hang on. Whoa, whoa.
Think about it for a minute.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.720
- We don't have a minute, Jake.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.955
Whalen is a loose cannon.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.824
Maggie, OA, we're going in now.
- Got it.

35:25.891 --> 35:32.998
* *

35:40.839 --> 35:43.175
- Bravo team, go.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.281
Alpha team, on me.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.333
- OA!

36:07.399 --> 36:14.306
* *

36:34.660 --> 36:35.961
Hey!

36:36.728 --> 36:37.896
Hey!

36:46.037 --> 36:49.508
[both grunting]

36:58.484 --> 36:59.751
- Where's the girl?

36:59.818 --> 37:00.986
- I couldn't just
let her leave!

37:01.052 --> 37:02.621
She's my daughter.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.089
I love her.

37:04.155 --> 37:07.158
She was my little baby!
- Where is she?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.328
- We were supposed to be
together forever.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.696
I love her.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.698
- Hey. Hey.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.165
Where is she?
- Isobel, we have him.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.367
We're bringing him back now.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.902
Let's go.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.272
- Nice job, you two.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.840
Dan, how's the search
of the house coming?

37:21.907 --> 37:22.974
Any sign of Annabelle?

37:23.041 --> 37:25.444
- Negative.
The house is clear.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.945
Let's move out.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.213
- There's no way.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.081
Annabelle is the only family
Whalen has.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.551
He's too attached to her
to not have her with him.

37:32.618 --> 37:33.852
Keep searching that house, Dan.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.554
She's gotta be there.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.488
- We can do another sweep.

37:36.555 --> 37:43.128
* *

37:59.545 --> 38:00.846
- What the hell?

38:04.182 --> 38:06.518
- Dan, talk to me.
Are you guys okay?

38:06.585 --> 38:07.986
- Gas line exploded.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.821
Whalen must have untethered it.
Everybody out, now!

38:09.888 --> 38:11.423
- Wait, what about the girl?

38:11.490 --> 38:12.758
- She isn't here.
We have to clear out.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.825
There's gas everywhere.

38:13.892 --> 38:14.993
The whole place is gonna go up.

38:15.060 --> 38:18.797
[officers shouting]

38:18.864 --> 38:20.098
- That's everyone.
- No, no.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.400
They--they don't
have Annabelle.

38:21.467 --> 38:22.468
We've gotta find her.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.171
- Are you out of your mind?

38:26.237 --> 38:28.006
They swept the place.
She isn't here.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.508
- No, she has to be.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.176
Annabelle means everything
to Whalen.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.278
- Hey, Izzy. It's suicide.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.681
- We let her down once,
and I will not do it again.

38:35.747 --> 38:42.888

38:47.559 --> 38:48.927
Annabelle?

[wood splintering]

39:05.477 --> 39:06.945
Annabelle?

39:14.786 --> 39:15.987
Annabelle?

39:23.294 --> 39:27.132
- [panting, coughing]

39:27.198 --> 39:30.936
- Annabelle, I'm with the FBI.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.538
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

39:32.604 --> 39:35.541

- Tasha, this is your mother,
Joan Collier.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.274
- I'm sorry, I didn't--

40:45.310 --> 40:47.112
He told me you were dead.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.448
- Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm.

40:53.585 --> 40:57.388
- You two have a lot to catch
up on, so take your time.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.457
When you're ready,
we're here to help.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.631
We're gonna get you
through this, okay?

41:05.697 --> 41:06.965
- Thank you.

41:07.032 --> 41:14.172

41:27.152 --> 41:30.288
- [sobbing]

41:44.736 --> 41:46.605
- How's Annabelle doing?

41:46.672 --> 41:47.539
- She's okay.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.240
She's, uh trying to process.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.909
You know, make sense
of everything.

41:50.976 --> 41:55.947
- Izzy, what you did,
running into that house, was--

41:56.014 --> 41:58.116
- Insane?

41:58.183 --> 41:59.384
- Yeah.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.454
We should--we should
go out and celebrate

42:03.521 --> 42:04.856
and have a couple of drinks.

42:04.923 --> 42:05.991
For old time's sake.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.628
- Mm, no.

42:09.695 --> 42:10.829
I don't think so.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.070
[sighs]

42:19.137 --> 42:22.741
- Well, it was really
good to see you.
