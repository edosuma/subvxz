Doug?

00:59.384 --> 01:00.942
Come on! We're busy again.

01:01.152 --> 01:02.346
l'm on double shift.

01:02.553 --> 01:05.349
So am l, and you wanted
a long weekend. Now get up.

01:05.554 --> 01:07.544
l was having a terrific dream.

01:07.755 --> 01:10.313
l was beating my high-school
football coach.

01:10.523 --> 01:13.457
Carter! Med students
don't sleep at 4:00 p.m.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.181
Get up, Carter.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.659
Woman with a headache,
thinks it's a brain tumor.

01:20.861 --> 01:24.795
A kid with gum in his eye,
and an old lady who wants her hand held.

01:24.996 --> 01:26.792
-l'm hungry.
-Cookies at the desk.

01:26.997 --> 01:29.760
Repeat H and H ordered
for abdominal pain in 2.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.329
-Good morning, Susan.
-lt's afternoon.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.591
l knew that.

01:33.801 --> 01:36.529
Your brain's rotted.
At your age, Ryne Sandberg retired.

01:36.735 --> 01:38.258
At my age, Mozart was dead.

01:38.469 --> 01:41.834
Jen, l can't get out. l've got
two residents on double shifts.

01:42.037 --> 01:44.004
l'll be home before Rachel goes to bed.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.502
-Tell Mark to go see his wife.
-Go see her.

01:46.706 --> 01:48.763
Why can't you tell me over the phone?

01:48.973 --> 01:52.372
Hang on. Jen, it's Doug.
Can you hold on a second?

01:52.575 --> 01:53.872
We can survive without you.

01:55.510 --> 01:58.102
l'll meet you there, all right? Bye.

01:58.611 --> 02:01.477
Thank you. l know you
can survive without me.

02:01.679 --> 02:05.238
Rescue's bringing in two victims,
motor-vehicle collision, one major.

02:05.448 --> 02:06.506
-How soon?
-Now.

02:06.715 --> 02:08.681
-Where's Benton?
-Am l his travel agent?

02:08.882 --> 02:10.440
Ask his student.

02:12.251 --> 02:14.241
Read about diseases,
you think you have them.

02:14.452 --> 02:17.147
Find Benton, head-on vehicle.
Two victims on the way.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.316
TC, seven months OB, vitals stable.

02:20.521 --> 02:21.851
Second victim behind her.

02:22.055 --> 02:23.317
What's your name, ma'am?

02:23.522 --> 02:25.546
-Sally Niemeyer.
-How far along are you?

02:25.757 --> 02:27.223
Almost seven months.

02:27.424 --> 02:29.118
Second one coming in.

02:31.493 --> 02:33.392
Chest trauma, vitals stable.

02:33.861 --> 02:35.122
Air bag didn't open.

02:35.328 --> 02:39.228
Name's Suarez, gangbanger,
stole a car, hit the pregnant lady.

02:41.064 --> 02:43.054
Miss Suarez, is there any pain?

02:48.768 --> 02:51.564
CBC, type and cross,
and hold four units.

02:51.769 --> 02:54.100
Hook her up to a fetal monitor.
Now, please.

02:54.304 --> 02:57.135
-Your baby has a steady heartbeat.
-l'm gonna have a boy.

02:57.338 --> 03:00.464
Get a K & B, call OB for ultrasound.
Does this hurt?

03:00.673 --> 03:02.230
Do you have pain in your head?

03:02.440 --> 03:06.636
No. That girl, she just ran
right into me, didn't even stop.

03:06.843 --> 03:08.400
What about me, man?

03:08.610 --> 03:10.008
Push down with your hand.

03:10.211 --> 03:11.472
Push again.

03:11.678 --> 03:13.110
That's good. Good.

03:13.312 --> 03:15.609
Push down on your foot,
like on a gas pedal.

03:18.482 --> 03:19.971
You're doing great.

03:20.849 --> 03:22.338
All right, gently.

03:26.084 --> 03:26.914
What?

03:29.086 --> 03:32.076
<i>You're in labor. Two centimeters
dilated, 40% effaced.</i>

03:32.287 --> 03:33.844
Can somebody call my husband?

03:34.322 --> 03:35.652
28 weeks, that's too early.

03:35.856 --> 03:38.517
-Want to stop it?
-l want to buy time for the kid's lungs.

03:38.890 --> 03:40.448
What if it's 34 weeks?

03:40.657 --> 03:42.284
lt doesn't feel like 34 weeks.

03:42.825 --> 03:44.382
We need ultrasound.

03:44.593 --> 03:45.457
l don't know.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.118
lt's too early.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.583
We gotta try.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.056
Will my baby be okay?

03:50.262 --> 03:51.694
Let's stop the labor.

03:51.896 --> 03:54.762
Bolus her six grams magnesium sulfate.

03:56.465 --> 03:58.728
Get a fetal lung profile.
Where's OB?

03:58.932 --> 03:59.956
What about me?

04:00.167 --> 04:01.690
ls my baby okay?

04:03.301 --> 04:04.494
lt's okay.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.063
lt's okay.

05:00.761 --> 05:02.921
That's incredible! lt's terrific.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.992
l still can't believe it.

05:05.196 --> 05:07.356
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?

05:09.198 --> 05:10.926
lt's in Milwaukee.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.893
lt's only two hours away.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.733
And a federal clerkship.

05:15.934 --> 05:17.958
l never dreamed l had a chance.

05:18.168 --> 05:20.931
l thought you wanted to be
a state's attorney.

05:21.137 --> 05:22.433
They haven't made an offer.

05:22.638 --> 05:26.935
The judge had a clerk.
The guy bagged out at the last minute.

05:27.273 --> 05:29.297
lt's a great break for you.

05:29.607 --> 05:31.073
You deserve it.

05:32.909 --> 05:34.341
You deserve it.

05:35.510 --> 05:37.841
There's lots of hospitals there.

05:38.044 --> 05:40.978
l don't know
about chief residents, but....

05:43.513 --> 05:46.379
We could live here, and
you could take the train.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.909
Four hours a day on a train?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.313
When will l have time to sleep?

05:52.518 --> 05:54.144
l'll never get to see Rachel.

06:01.188 --> 06:03.155
l'll make some phone calls.

06:04.523 --> 06:06.149
See what they got up there.

06:13.294 --> 06:15.625
l've made a lot of compromises, Mark.

06:29.901 --> 06:31.231
Doug, they're not stopping.

06:31.435 --> 06:32.868
Contractions two minutes apart.

06:33.703 --> 06:34.692
Doug?

06:34.937 --> 06:37.632
l don't like this.
We're gonna have major lung trouble.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.667
-Fetal heart rate?
-1 35 and dropping.

06:40.873 --> 06:43.272
We got 1 28. Late decelerations.

06:43.641 --> 06:46.130
-Fetal distress may be acidotic.
-What's wrong?

06:46.342 --> 06:47.536
ls my baby okay?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.204
We're taking care of your baby.

06:56.614 --> 06:57.637
Her water's broken.

06:57.981 --> 07:01.210
All right, we can't stop this.
Let's go for delivery.

07:03.150 --> 07:06.083
Call OB. Tell them we're on the way.

07:06.284 --> 07:09.377
Call Neonatal, tell them
to expect a preemie, 28 weeks.

07:09.587 --> 07:11.315
Tell Third Floor to send a team to 5.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.352
Mrs. Niemeyer, you're gonna
deliver your baby right now.

07:14.555 --> 07:16.681
-Let's clear that, please!
-You got it?

07:16.890 --> 07:17.878
Here you go.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.484
How's Jennifer?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.285
She got a great job in Milwaukee.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.249
Can she do it by phone?

07:28.461 --> 07:31.486
l don't think that's what
the federal judge has in mind.

07:31.696 --> 07:33.163
Milwaukee?

07:33.730 --> 07:35.629
Don't ask. l don't know.

07:37.565 --> 07:40.089
Miss Suarez, you hit a pregnant woman.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.461
We're not too happy about that,
but we'll take care of you.

07:43.668 --> 07:45.692
Now, you have to tell us the truth.

07:45.903 --> 07:48.097
-Did you take any drugs today?
-No.

07:48.303 --> 07:51.203
1 70 over 1 00. Pulse 1 20.

07:51.806 --> 07:54.136
Do any cocaine, maybe a little crack?

07:54.840 --> 07:55.965
No!

07:56.341 --> 07:57.932
Yeah, right.

07:58.575 --> 08:02.236
CBC, tox screen and
let's get a chest film. Now.

08:03.944 --> 08:05.069
Look at this board!

08:05.311 --> 08:07.210
Don't worry, it'll get quieter.

08:07.412 --> 08:10.379
Don't say the ''Q'' word.
You'll start a stampede.

08:10.614 --> 08:12.911
-Take the kid in 1 .
-All right.

08:13.382 --> 08:15.814
-She deliver?
-Right out of the elevator.

08:16.016 --> 08:18.916
The baby's in Neonatal,
lungs are bad, hyaline membrane.

08:19.118 --> 08:20.482
Good night. Mom's okay.

08:20.685 --> 08:21.673
Good night, Billy.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.583
Dr. Ross?

08:25.153 --> 08:25.983
Can l talk to you?

08:26.188 --> 08:27.950
Sure, if you can keep me awake.

08:28.955 --> 08:33.652
lf a patient has a burning
sensation, does he necessarily have--?

08:33.857 --> 08:35.688
A sexually transmitted disease?
Probably.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.381
You have to do a culture.
Ever do that?

08:38.592 --> 08:40.116
No. Okay.

08:40.461 --> 08:42.485
First you gotta do a chlamydia prep.

08:42.794 --> 08:45.091
Then you have to do a Gram's stain...

08:45.296 --> 08:46.320
...for gonorrhea.

08:46.530 --> 08:47.689
Stick this bad boy...

08:47.897 --> 08:51.661
...in about a quarter of an inch,
and spin it around about ten times.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.264
Ten times?

08:53.467 --> 08:54.956
Who's the lucky girl?

08:57.369 --> 08:59.835
Liz. The girl with the rash.

09:01.570 --> 09:05.595
Old hospital saying, Carter:
Don't dip your pen in company ink.

09:05.805 --> 09:07.738
l hope you used a condom.

09:10.741 --> 09:15.335
We got a Code 3 from Rescue 63, full
arrest. They're on their way in now.

09:16.243 --> 09:17.471
Can l take her?

09:17.678 --> 09:19.269
Not until her tests are back.

09:19.479 --> 09:21.070
She's breathing, ain't she?

09:22.580 --> 09:26.309
She stole the car
and hit a pregnant lady.

09:27.715 --> 09:30.080
For all l know, she could
have an aortic rupture.

09:30.283 --> 09:31.909
You want her to die in jail?

09:32.351 --> 09:33.681
Frankly, doc?

09:34.152 --> 09:35.743
l wouldn't lose sleep.

09:38.820 --> 09:39.844
Neither would l.

09:40.054 --> 09:42.180
But l'm liable. You're not.

09:46.124 --> 09:48.523
Mom, listen. l can barely hear you.

09:50.393 --> 09:51.859
Got a heart. Where to?

09:52.060 --> 09:54.493
Trauma 2. Last door on your right.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.026
-Susan, we need you.
-l gotta go. Bye.

10:03.098 --> 10:05.395
l'm really okay. Are you doctors?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.429
l'm Dr. Lewis.

10:06.633 --> 10:08.463
l thought he was in full arrest.

10:08.668 --> 10:11.567
l was, until they
fried my chest hairs.

10:12.469 --> 10:14.935
Let's get a CBC, Chem-7, blood gas...

10:15.137 --> 10:16.502
...and coag panel.

10:16.705 --> 10:19.069
On my count. One, two...

10:19.272 --> 10:20.261
...three.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.864
He was in fib. Shocked him once,
converted fast.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.064
He had a 1 00 milligrams of lidocaine.

10:31.378 --> 10:32.742
How did it feel? Any pain?

10:33.278 --> 10:34.836
l don't remember.

10:35.579 --> 10:36.568
l passed out.

10:36.781 --> 10:37.940
Can we get a monitor?

10:38.148 --> 10:42.378
Do you have a history
of heart problems, Mr. Gasner?

10:42.582 --> 10:44.242
Nothing a transplant wouldn't cure.

10:44.884 --> 10:46.350
l was up for a good one.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.848
A kid in a motorcycle accident.

10:49.053 --> 10:50.417
lt went to Minneapolis.

10:51.154 --> 10:52.484
Who's your cardiologist?

10:52.688 --> 10:55.178
Mike Dickey. Great guy.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.355
He's at St. Luke's in Cleveland.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.523
l'm in town
for the builders' convention.

11:00.358 --> 11:02.257
My wife said l shouldn't travel.

11:02.591 --> 11:06.082
But how could l miss 2,000
construction guys in one....

11:07.761 --> 11:08.988
l don't get a pulse.

11:09.195 --> 11:10.024
Mr. Gasner?

11:12.763 --> 11:14.059
What? He's not in fib.

11:14.264 --> 11:15.253
Give him an amp of epi.

11:19.332 --> 11:20.356
Come on.

11:20.567 --> 11:21.692
Come on back.

11:21.901 --> 11:23.390
l'll call for his history.

11:31.238 --> 11:32.226
l just pass out.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.474
Start a dopamine drip, 400
in 250 D5W, 1 0 drops a minute.

11:39.942 --> 11:42.102
My chest feels like someone sat on it.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.033
That happens sometimes.

11:47.112 --> 11:48.409
l know.

11:51.047 --> 11:53.014
Give her something. She can't breathe.

11:53.215 --> 11:55.273
That's it.
Keep taking deep breaths.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.275
Blood gases are back.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.774
Not good. PO-2's 70.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.975
Are you taking any medications?

12:03.186 --> 12:06.586
lt's never been this bad.

12:07.655 --> 12:10.020
Hand-held nebs,
albuterol 2.5 milligrams.

12:10.223 --> 12:11.951
Peak flow, pre and post.

12:12.157 --> 12:13.919
Give her Solumedrol
50 mgs lV.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.455
Can l talk to you outside for a second?

12:16.659 --> 12:19.354
Sandy, this is Lydia.
She'll take care of you.

12:19.561 --> 12:21.527
You're gonna be fine, okay?

12:23.895 --> 12:25.122
Just keep breathing.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.523
Keep breathing.

12:28.398 --> 12:30.990
Your daughter's having
a serious asthma attack.

12:31.199 --> 12:32.529
ls she allergic to anything?

12:32.733 --> 12:34.290
l don't think so.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.990
Do you have any pets?

12:36.701 --> 12:38.292
This cat, a stray.

12:38.502 --> 12:40.366
Sandy found her.
She just loves her.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.196
You have to get rid of the cat.

12:42.404 --> 12:45.997
We need to do some tests.
lt'll take about two hours, okay?

12:55.376 --> 12:58.366
Gasner, G-A-S-N-E-R, first name Samuel.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.044
Can you fax us his chart?

13:00.245 --> 13:02.906
Are you a doctor?
They said my wife was here.

13:03.114 --> 13:03.943
What's your name?

13:04.147 --> 13:07.376
Niemeyer. She's pregnant.
ls she all right?

13:07.582 --> 13:09.708
Jerry. Mr. Niemeyer.

13:09.916 --> 13:11.746
l'll take you up to Neonatal.

13:11.951 --> 13:12.781
Neo-what?

13:12.984 --> 13:13.973
You had a baby.

13:14.185 --> 13:15.344
Thanks, Jerry.

13:15.552 --> 13:18.917
Dr. Greene, with an ''E''
at the end. He's chief resident.

13:21.255 --> 13:22.949
l got a little tired.

13:23.656 --> 13:25.952
Built 1 5 houses this year.

13:26.557 --> 13:31.287
l wanted to design them,
but l just build them.

13:32.026 --> 13:33.993
Could you stop talking for a second?

13:37.195 --> 13:41.220
Old inferior wall Ml, low voltage...

13:41.865 --> 13:44.195
...consistent with severe myopathy.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.633
l've been through this.
l know what it says.

13:49.201 --> 13:50.462
lt's nothing new.

13:51.302 --> 13:52.700
Am l gonna make it tonight?

13:54.437 --> 13:56.370
l ask every time.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.171
He's in fib.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.103
Charging.

14:03.941 --> 14:04.929
Ready.

14:05.575 --> 14:06.666
-Two hundred.
-Clear.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.908
Another 50 of lidocaine.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.543
Start a drip.

14:13.045 --> 14:14.409
Two grams at 500.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.671
l don't usually do that.

14:23.617 --> 14:25.811
Could somebody please call my wife?

14:39.924 --> 14:41.356
That's a big boggy heart.

14:41.558 --> 14:43.957
Suppose we get a transplant.
ls it too late?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.683
He's been defibrillated twice.

14:45.894 --> 14:47.554
He in cardiogenic shock.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.421
Keeps going in and out.
Can't be much muscle there.

14:50.629 --> 14:52.653
Jerry, call Cardiology for an echo.

14:52.863 --> 14:55.557
Wake up Dr. Flint,
get him here from Lake Forest.

14:55.764 --> 14:59.459
Call the transplant coordinator,
see if they got any hearts around.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.132
And your wife called.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.323
Great! l missed calling Rachel.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.331
Get ahold of the Gasner family?

15:05.536 --> 15:07.230
l'm trying every ten minutes.

15:07.436 --> 15:10.665
Gasner doesn't think
he'll make it through the night.

15:13.473 --> 15:16.440
Dr. Ross, peak flow's
gone from 1 90 to 300.

15:16.641 --> 15:18.301
-How's her gases?
-Much better.

15:18.508 --> 15:20.839
Sandy, you are doing great.

15:21.043 --> 15:23.168
She'll need an appointment
with your doctor.

15:23.377 --> 15:26.607
She's also going to need
an inhaler at home...

15:26.812 --> 15:29.746
...and prednisone.
Fill this thing out tonight.

15:29.947 --> 15:33.005
Hospital pharmacy is open 24 hours...

15:33.215 --> 15:35.239
...and it's on the first floor.

15:36.049 --> 15:37.277
There you go.

15:44.086 --> 15:45.575
l thought you were off at 1 0.

15:45.787 --> 15:48.948
-l'm on all night. How about you?
-l'm on a double.

15:50.323 --> 15:51.448
-Thank you.
-Sure.

15:51.657 --> 15:55.250
Why is Mark getting messages
from University Hospital in Milwaukee?

15:55.458 --> 15:57.425
His wife wants to move.
She got a job there.

15:57.626 --> 15:58.990
ls he gonna do it?

15:59.194 --> 16:00.854
l hope not.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.824
l can't imagine he'd be happy there.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.487
He ever go home?

16:07.697 --> 16:09.926
He's waiting for that
gang girl's recovery.

16:14.301 --> 16:15.267
What's he doing?

16:15.467 --> 16:17.263
Practicing one-handed knots.

16:17.468 --> 16:19.435
He'd do it with his teeth if he could.

16:19.636 --> 16:21.932
No, you can't wear
a glove on your teeth.

16:23.637 --> 16:25.298
What are you listening to?

16:26.606 --> 16:28.470
Snoop Doggy Dog.

16:31.641 --> 16:34.608
<i>Trends in Cardiac Surgery, Volume Two.</i>

16:42.246 --> 16:45.180
Blood pressure's falling, 80 over 60.

16:45.381 --> 16:49.838
Add a dobutamine drip, 250 in 250,
4cc's a minute.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.441
You feel crummy...

16:53.551 --> 16:57.383
...waiting around for a kid to smash up
his car so you can get his heart.

16:57.653 --> 16:59.381
We're getting great pictures.

16:59.621 --> 17:01.679
Frame one for me, will you?

17:07.325 --> 17:08.348
How's your heart?

17:08.558 --> 17:11.025
lt's in pretty good shape.

17:11.559 --> 17:13.752
Want to lend it to me for the weekend?

17:17.295 --> 17:19.421
You got better things to do with it.

17:20.864 --> 17:25.026
Do them all. You never know
when you'll get the chance.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.300
Left ventricle, please.

17:30.435 --> 17:31.628
You got kids, doc?

17:32.002 --> 17:34.196
A daughter. She's five.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.703
My girl's nine.

17:40.173 --> 17:41.730
Her age...

17:43.541 --> 17:45.508
...l shouldn't really travel.

17:49.310 --> 17:51.504
l miss too much of her life.

17:54.379 --> 17:56.073
What can l say?

17:58.481 --> 18:00.004
l love the job.

18:00.616 --> 18:01.741
How you doing?

18:02.183 --> 18:07.083
To tell you the truth, l felt
a hell of a lot better yesterday.

18:08.919 --> 18:10.613
What's your wife do, doc?

18:11.153 --> 18:12.449
She's a lawyer.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.587
You guys must have your hands full.

18:18.257 --> 18:19.553
Did l get any tests back?

18:19.757 --> 18:21.451
-On who?
-A patient.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.518
Does the patient have a name?

18:23.726 --> 18:25.920
Yeah. lt's Car-tere.

18:26.526 --> 18:27.857
l'll watch out for them.

18:28.061 --> 18:29.755
Don't tell anybody the results.

18:29.962 --> 18:31.929
''Secret'' is my middle name.

18:32.129 --> 18:34.096
Gasner, Samuel. We called in.

18:34.297 --> 18:36.355
Look, we'll take any heart.

18:36.565 --> 18:37.656
Anything?

18:39.166 --> 18:42.429
Type A blood, negative
T-cell cross-match, okay?

18:42.635 --> 18:44.828
Keep us posted. We need a heart.

18:45.035 --> 18:46.127
Thank you.

18:46.336 --> 18:47.427
He's getting weaker.

18:47.637 --> 18:50.002
l can't pull a heart out of thin air.

18:50.205 --> 18:51.899
Gunshot wound to the foot.

18:52.106 --> 18:54.299
The liquor store guy again,
asking for you.

18:54.506 --> 18:58.133
lvan? What does he do,
wear a sign that says ''shoot me''?

19:04.845 --> 19:07.243
lvan, lvan, lvan.
Who did it this time?

19:07.445 --> 19:08.571
Me, l did it.

19:08.779 --> 19:11.713
-l thought you didn't have a gun.
-l bought a little Glock.

19:11.915 --> 19:12.938
Oh, God, it hurts!

19:13.148 --> 19:17.378
Let's get a gram of ancef, and
1 50 gentamycin lV, book an O.R.

19:17.584 --> 19:20.073
That last BP was a little high,
1 80 over 1 1 0.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.582
All right, 1 0 Procardia sublingual.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.719
Russia's crazy.
You need vodka to get good doctor.

19:26.254 --> 19:27.515
God bless America.

19:27.721 --> 19:29.847
God didn't bless your neighborhood.

19:30.056 --> 19:33.353
l was showing the gun to Nicky,
the dry cleaner, and bang!

19:33.557 --> 19:34.716
Off went half your toe.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.114
Will l lose it?

19:36.458 --> 19:37.288
You already did.

19:39.027 --> 19:40.152
Let's go.

19:41.861 --> 19:43.351
Still can't find a donor.

19:43.561 --> 19:45.653
There's one,
but the blood type is AB.

19:45.863 --> 19:47.352
How hard is it to find a type A?

19:47.563 --> 19:51.327
The patient has advanced
dilated cardiomyopathy...

19:51.532 --> 19:53.522
...with severe mitral regurgitation...

19:53.733 --> 19:56.257
<i>...and an ejection fraction
of less than 1 0%.</i>

19:56.567 --> 19:58.932
This is not the best news
l've heard all day.

19:59.136 --> 20:01.932
So, Steve, do you have an opinion?

20:02.137 --> 20:06.697
Dr. Kayson and l agree on little, but
we're both happy not to be Mr. Gasner.

20:06.906 --> 20:11.533
What if we put him on a heart-lung
bypass while we look for another donor?

20:11.741 --> 20:15.004
l'd say the stress alone
would kill him in a couple of hours.

20:15.209 --> 20:19.268
Put the transplant team on call. We'll
put him on the table in 20 minutes.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.939
Mr. Gasner's wife
will be here around three.

20:27.149 --> 20:29.342
Somebody's going to have to tell them.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.382
Have the desk beep me
when she gets here.

20:56.462 --> 20:57.428
Hey, Carter!

20:57.629 --> 20:58.993
Bend over!

20:59.697 --> 21:01.163
There we go.

21:02.931 --> 21:05.194
l'm cooking now.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.429
All right, hold still.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.557
What is he doing?

21:10.735 --> 21:11.860
l lost a bet.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.432
He's my backboard.

21:14.770 --> 21:15.599
Mark?

21:15.837 --> 21:17.303
l'm on a roll here. Here we go.

21:17.504 --> 21:19.266
And the shot!

21:19.472 --> 21:21.302
You ruined my concentration.

21:24.208 --> 21:25.970
Dr. Ross?

21:26.442 --> 21:28.102
Baby in 4.

21:32.478 --> 21:33.739
Seven inches taller...

21:34.746 --> 21:36.269
...l would've been a contender.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.743
Bulls. Knicks.

21:39.614 --> 21:42.241
-Any luck with that heart?
-No.

21:54.121 --> 21:56.315
l heard your wife
got a job in Milwaukee.

21:57.090 --> 21:59.921
Yeah, she's clerking
for a federal judge.

22:02.258 --> 22:03.849
That sounds exciting.

22:04.526 --> 22:05.651
lt is.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.492
You gonna leave the hospital?

22:13.263 --> 22:14.490
l don't know.

22:15.398 --> 22:16.659
l thought you were off.

22:20.033 --> 22:21.022
Yeah, l am.

22:21.233 --> 22:24.258
l just thought l'd stick around.

22:25.736 --> 22:29.170
You ever have one like Mr. Gasner
before, one that took so long?

22:29.537 --> 22:30.525
No.

22:37.608 --> 22:39.131
You look like hell, Carter.

22:41.509 --> 22:45.136
Yeah, l'm just waiting for Ben--
Dr. Benton to leave.

22:46.512 --> 22:48.001
You need some sleep.

22:55.483 --> 22:57.245
That hurt.

22:57.983 --> 23:01.042
You've taken a bad fall, Mrs. Fadem.

23:01.752 --> 23:02.912
l'll get some x-rays.

23:03.186 --> 23:06.915
No. No x-rays.
They'll hurt my baby.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.087
How long have you been pregnant?

23:10.390 --> 23:11.981
Six months now.

23:14.691 --> 23:19.058
Your baby'll be protected.
We'll shield you with lead...

23:19.260 --> 23:20.920
...and we'll use a low dose.

23:23.429 --> 23:26.089
As long as you promise
not to hurt my baby.

23:27.097 --> 23:27.926
l promise.

23:32.866 --> 23:33.855
Lydia...

23:34.434 --> 23:38.367
...take Mrs. Fadem to Radiology.
And be careful of her pregnancy.

23:38.568 --> 23:39.899
Right away.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.270
-Her what?
-Pregnancy.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.966
You worry too much.

23:49.174 --> 23:50.697
Kayson hates me.

23:50.908 --> 23:51.999
He's a cardiologist.

23:52.208 --> 23:54.607
He's on my review board.
l'll need his recommendation.

23:54.809 --> 23:55.969
Why would you want it?

23:56.544 --> 24:00.307
The man loses so many patients,
he gets endorsements from funeral homes.

24:01.579 --> 24:05.774
When l was your age l worried about
what every attending thought of me too.

24:05.981 --> 24:08.175
Forget it. You're a good doctor.

24:08.616 --> 24:11.344
You're better than my ex,
and l actually married her.

24:11.550 --> 24:16.349
A lot of subjects interest me, and
believe me, your ex-wife tops my list.

24:19.054 --> 24:20.351
That's me.

24:20.854 --> 24:24.253
My knife-wielding psychotic
must be up from his nap.

24:26.690 --> 24:27.679
Later.

24:34.194 --> 24:35.421
Your wife's on her way.

24:36.295 --> 24:38.091
She'll be a wreck.

24:38.563 --> 24:40.722
He's not putting out fluids.

24:41.764 --> 24:43.788
One-sixty of Lasix.

24:44.799 --> 24:46.096
Hey, doc?

24:47.300 --> 24:48.493
Do l look stupid?

24:49.735 --> 24:51.167
Why don't you tell me?

24:52.169 --> 24:53.999
You versus God.

24:55.171 --> 24:56.159
We know who wins.

24:57.271 --> 24:58.670
l don't think of it that way.

25:01.006 --> 25:02.598
You don't have to.

25:04.641 --> 25:06.006
l'm the one on the table.

25:12.445 --> 25:14.241
We looked at your echo.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.575
And if we don't find a donor heart...

25:18.214 --> 25:21.113
...you probably won't
make it through the night.

25:28.452 --> 25:30.180
lt's two in the morning.

25:32.187 --> 25:33.586
l'm dying.

25:35.122 --> 25:36.748
So please...

25:38.390 --> 25:40.084
...call me Sam.

25:44.193 --> 25:46.285
This is no time to be formal.

25:59.666 --> 26:01.599
Don't forget to check on lvan.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.266
Can l take the girl now?

26:03.468 --> 26:04.526
The gangbanger?

26:04.735 --> 26:08.191
Aortic rupture. l forgot to tell you,
she died in recovery.

26:08.404 --> 26:09.392
Well....

26:09.938 --> 26:11.427
l'll see you at seven.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.729
-A.M.?
-Good night.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.906
Why bother driving home?
Three hours sleep.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.597
l've got to come back here.
This is nuts.

26:17.807 --> 26:22.742
Quinn, Daniel. Hypotensive, comatose.
Fraternity kid, drinking all night.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.068
Ever see anybody intubated?

26:25.744 --> 26:26.733
No.

26:27.645 --> 26:30.078
Get Respiratory in here.
Start a second line.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.076
D50, one amp, 2 mg Narcan.

26:32.281 --> 26:34.440
Pam, get an EKG.

26:34.715 --> 26:37.046
Mr. Quinn, do you hear me?

26:38.016 --> 26:39.846
-Daniel?
-Respiratory's on the way.

26:40.351 --> 26:43.080
He's cyanotic. Add dopamine.
Hyperventilate him.

26:43.286 --> 26:44.377
The line's in, Susan.

26:44.587 --> 26:46.451
BP 70 over 40 and falling.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.644
Get a CBC, blood alcohol,
Chem-7 and tox screen. Tube him.

26:49.856 --> 26:50.844
Blood sat's 80.

26:51.056 --> 26:52.648
Do a dextrose stick.

26:52.857 --> 26:56.382
Okay, Carter, pay attention.
This is where it counts.

26:56.592 --> 26:57.854
Visualize the cords.

26:58.060 --> 27:02.084
You don't want to miss the trachea
and end up in his esophagus.

27:08.631 --> 27:10.063
lt's in.

27:10.765 --> 27:12.095
Bag him.

27:12.733 --> 27:15.894
Listen to the lungs to make sure
the tube's in place.

27:16.101 --> 27:20.160
Glucose is normal.
BP is steady, 80 over 65.

27:21.604 --> 27:22.729
Draw a blood gas now.

27:30.207 --> 27:31.195
Doug?

27:31.407 --> 27:34.739
They called from Neonatal
if you want to look at the preemie.

27:34.942 --> 27:36.239
He's gonna be okay.

27:36.444 --> 27:38.070
God smiled on him.

27:38.278 --> 27:39.642
Since when do you believe in God?

27:39.845 --> 27:42.812
l've been contemplating
my insignificance in the universe.

27:43.013 --> 27:44.843
l thought you were its center.

27:45.047 --> 27:46.274
Not always.

27:46.481 --> 27:49.744
l'm looking for Dr. Ross.
He's in the emergency room.

27:49.949 --> 27:51.882
Yeah, l'm Dr. Ross.

27:52.251 --> 27:54.081
Thank you very much.

27:54.619 --> 27:55.846
You're welcome.

27:57.319 --> 27:58.308
Who are you?

27:58.521 --> 28:00.646
l'm Randy Niemeyer.

28:01.155 --> 28:02.553
My wife, my baby....

28:03.456 --> 28:05.184
They said you took her up.

28:05.757 --> 28:07.553
My boy's gonna be okay.

28:08.791 --> 28:11.952
l'm just on my way up to see your baby.
You want to...?

28:20.063 --> 28:23.428
We're hydrating like crazy
and his blood pressure's not moving.

28:23.632 --> 28:26.622
Order LFTs, BUN and creatinine.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.563
His friend's here.

28:28.767 --> 28:30.791
He says the guy didn't have
that much to drink.

28:31.002 --> 28:33.333
And the Cubs are a shoo-in
for the pennant.

28:34.236 --> 28:35.566
Elliot, this is Dr. Lewis.

28:35.770 --> 28:37.498
How much did Mr. Quinn drink?

28:37.838 --> 28:40.567
We were playing this game,
Whale's Tales.

28:40.773 --> 28:43.433
You say numbers. lf you
can't remember them, you drink.

28:43.641 --> 28:44.937
How much did Mr. Quinn drink?

28:45.141 --> 28:48.870
Listen, his father's an assistant dean.
lf he finds out about--

28:49.076 --> 28:51.839
What was he drinking and how much?

28:53.145 --> 28:54.236
Beer.

28:54.846 --> 28:56.745
Beer and shots of tequila.

28:56.947 --> 28:59.073
He must've had 1 5, 20 shots.

28:59.281 --> 29:00.908
-Did he do any drugs?
-No.

29:02.550 --> 29:04.846
-Will he be all right?
-l hope so.

29:09.686 --> 29:11.346
Blood alcohol's back,
.832.

29:11.687 --> 29:15.086
Call Dialysis. Let them know
we're on the way. Let's move him.

29:22.825 --> 29:25.155
-Mrs. Gasner?
-l'm Elaine Gasner.

29:25.359 --> 29:26.485
This is Sarah.

29:26.694 --> 29:28.990
Hi, Sarah. l'm Dr. Greene.

29:32.130 --> 29:33.687
Sit down, honey.

29:38.432 --> 29:40.160
Where's my husband? Can l see him?

29:40.366 --> 29:41.559
He's sleeping.

29:42.367 --> 29:45.334
l need to tell you about his condition.

29:46.636 --> 29:49.262
His heart muscle is badly deteriorated.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.065
They said he could get a transplant.

29:52.272 --> 29:56.069
lf there was one available.
There isn't one tonight.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.136
He can wait till they find one.

30:00.509 --> 30:02.738
Your husband's heart is failing.

30:05.212 --> 30:07.110
Unless we find a heart donor...

30:07.312 --> 30:11.474
...in the next couple of hours, l don't
believe he'll make it through the night.

30:15.349 --> 30:16.542
l'm sorry.

30:41.661 --> 30:42.649
Sam?

30:47.197 --> 30:48.254
Mark....

30:48.598 --> 30:50.087
Your wife and daughter are here.

30:51.032 --> 30:52.760
l was thinking....

30:55.901 --> 30:57.424
Did you hear the one...

30:58.935 --> 31:01.425
...about the guy on the country road?

31:04.104 --> 31:05.798
Flat tire.

31:07.406 --> 31:09.373
Doesn't have a jack....

31:16.310 --> 31:17.640
Never mind.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.708
You think you can avoid it.

31:24.947 --> 31:26.777
lt all counts.

31:27.915 --> 31:30.109
Decisions you don't make.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.882
The real joke is...

31:38.786 --> 31:40.946
...l'm still gonna die.

31:44.257 --> 31:46.280
l guess l'm getting ready for it.

31:54.127 --> 31:55.388
l'm not ready.

31:57.795 --> 31:59.557
Damn it, l'm not!

32:02.465 --> 32:04.329
l don't want to leave them.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.794
Sarah needs me.

32:29.610 --> 32:31.634
Could you please have my wife...

32:33.911 --> 32:35.901
...bring Sarah in?

32:37.114 --> 32:38.102
Sure.

32:50.319 --> 32:51.377
Don't say it.

32:51.587 --> 32:52.575
What?

32:54.321 --> 32:56.754
That l should be grateful to be alive.

32:58.056 --> 32:59.886
That's not what l was thinking.

33:02.859 --> 33:04.519
What were you thinking?

33:07.627 --> 33:08.854
l don't know.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.233
ls there any chance?

33:22.668 --> 33:25.158
Type A, negative cross-match.

33:25.368 --> 33:28.803
Forty-three years old.
He can handle the surgery.

33:29.704 --> 33:32.001
lt just seems that marriage
should be easier.

33:32.205 --> 33:33.899
l never heard it called easy.

33:34.106 --> 33:37.301
Sometimes l think we did it
just to make our parents happy.

33:37.508 --> 33:39.872
-You're good at making people happy.
-Not this week.

33:41.476 --> 33:42.464
What?

33:43.377 --> 33:45.310
How soon will you know?

33:46.245 --> 33:51.043
A 1 9-year-old flatline EEG. Can't find
the parents to sign a release.

33:53.181 --> 33:54.977
What'll you do about Milwaukee?

33:55.215 --> 33:57.978
l could be a junior resident
at a suburban hospital.

34:00.751 --> 34:02.274
That'd do wonders for your career.

34:03.486 --> 34:04.975
lt all counts.

34:05.820 --> 34:06.809
What?

34:07.587 --> 34:08.576
Nothing.

34:08.789 --> 34:11.187
Your dialysis kid's coming around.

34:11.389 --> 34:12.378
Good.

34:22.226 --> 34:26.184
Well, can you keep trying?
l need that heart.

34:26.763 --> 34:27.751
Thanks.

34:31.465 --> 34:35.422
Can you do me a favor and get a hotel
for Mrs. Gasner and her daughter?

34:35.634 --> 34:36.623
Sure.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.299
You okay, Dr. Greene?

34:40.969 --> 34:43.458
l'm fine, Jerry. Thanks.

34:49.274 --> 34:50.603
Dr. Ross?

34:51.175 --> 34:55.165
Lydia, what is a seven letter word
for ''dumb,'' beginning with an ''M''?

34:56.110 --> 34:58.509
''Moronic.'' Your asthma patient's back.

35:04.114 --> 35:06.546
-She tried to sleep--
-Where's the inhaler?

35:06.748 --> 35:08.180
l didn't get it.

35:09.716 --> 35:13.946
She's having another attack. l told you
to fill out that prescription tonight.

35:14.151 --> 35:16.618
She could've died. You understand that?

35:16.953 --> 35:18.715
The medicine costs $30.

35:18.920 --> 35:22.377
l don't have the money.
Medicaid don't come for another week.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.618
l'll be back.

35:35.761 --> 35:37.284
Do we have a spare inhaler?

35:37.495 --> 35:40.122
Just the one.
lf he's that bad, he should come in.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.955
-What about Proventil samples?
-Nope.

35:44.165 --> 35:46.223
We can't diagnose over the phone.

35:46.432 --> 35:49.025
lf that's what you want to do.
Thank you.

35:49.334 --> 35:51.597
-Prednisone, any of that?
-Plenty.

35:52.702 --> 35:53.669
On the top shelf.

35:56.537 --> 35:58.766
lt'll take more
to get her through the week.

35:58.972 --> 36:01.097
You seem very interested.
She must be pretty.

36:01.306 --> 36:02.739
She's 1 2.

36:03.707 --> 36:05.640
l'll see what else l can turn up.

36:09.477 --> 36:11.205
Jerry, l don't get it.

36:11.411 --> 36:14.435
l sent that Gram stain ages ago,
and it's not back yet?

36:15.246 --> 36:17.509
-Who was that for again?
-Mine. For me.

36:17.713 --> 36:20.010
Oh, yes. lt came in about three.

36:20.215 --> 36:21.806
Where is it, Jerry?

36:22.616 --> 36:24.139
Bulletin board.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.783
Excuse me.

36:38.323 --> 36:39.619
You gotta do something.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.618
l feel like l'm gonna throw up.

36:46.827 --> 36:49.350
We wouldn't want that.
Not here in the hall.

36:51.262 --> 36:52.455
Come with me.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.456
Hi, John.

37:14.140 --> 37:16.004
Hi, Puppy.

37:17.274 --> 37:19.366
You're up pretty late.

37:20.275 --> 37:22.640
l fell asleep on the plane.

37:22.843 --> 37:24.309
Did you have fun with Grandma?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.472
She gave me a present.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.477
Blood sat's 80 percent.

37:29.679 --> 37:32.169
-What did you get?
-Fifteen liters O-2.

37:32.814 --> 37:34.338
A diary.

37:36.582 --> 37:38.879
Grandma made the cover herself.

37:40.184 --> 37:42.811
Grandma likes to make things for you.

38:25.939 --> 38:28.303
My mom says my dad's gonna die.

38:32.375 --> 38:33.534
Yes, he is.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.234
Why can't you fix him?

38:42.813 --> 38:44.939
We can't fix everything.

38:54.218 --> 38:55.548
l can breathe now.

38:56.319 --> 38:57.717
We don't have an inhaler.

38:57.920 --> 39:01.251
Take the prednisone every day
and visit the clinic in the morning.

39:01.455 --> 39:03.285
Tomorrow? l can't go tomorrow.

39:03.489 --> 39:04.546
lt's important.

39:05.190 --> 39:07.384
l gotta go to work.
lt's my second week.

39:07.591 --> 39:08.818
Dr. Ross?

39:09.025 --> 39:11.492
There's a kid throwing up in 3.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.056
Okay. You're gonna
have to take off work.

39:14.260 --> 39:16.659
-l can't.
-She has to have the medication.

39:17.495 --> 39:19.394
lt has to be done, okay?

39:19.896 --> 39:20.726
So do it.

39:32.202 --> 39:33.964
l know, Elaine.

39:34.169 --> 39:35.534
l know.

39:39.872 --> 39:42.305
l forgot a long time ago.

39:49.043 --> 39:51.442
l was always sure of you.

39:52.544 --> 39:54.738
You never let me down.

39:57.247 --> 39:58.235
Sam!

40:01.216 --> 40:02.045
Please.

40:02.249 --> 40:04.307
l have to tell him one more thing.

40:04.517 --> 40:06.711
You have to make him hear me.

40:13.187 --> 40:15.051
Forever, honey.

40:15.856 --> 40:16.844
Forever.

40:18.723 --> 40:20.815
Sarah'll be fine.

40:22.959 --> 40:26.256
Remind her l love her.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.228
Mr. Quinn?

40:37.599 --> 40:38.758
Daniel?

40:41.833 --> 40:43.561
l'm Dr. Lewis.

40:43.767 --> 40:46.496
You're on dialysis
because you drank too much.

40:46.703 --> 40:48.932
Would you blink if you understand me?

40:50.937 --> 40:54.201
We'll be taking that tube
out of your windpipe soon.

40:54.572 --> 40:58.438
Your kidneys are functioning.
Your liver's fine.

40:58.641 --> 41:02.370
And you lost a few million brain cells,
but you can spare them.

41:02.810 --> 41:04.936
Blink if you will never do this again.

41:35.258 --> 41:38.021
Playing one-on-one against yourself
is the easy way.

41:38.226 --> 41:39.157
Here you go.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.587
Here you go. Come on.

41:45.096 --> 41:46.585
Get by me. l'm the short guy.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.059
You said you could've been a contender.

41:51.932 --> 41:53.899
You distracted me.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.130
-That's the game.
-What do you want?

41:57.334 --> 41:59.062
Can l borrow forty bucks?

42:00.370 --> 42:02.563
-For what?
-l gotta run an errand.

42:08.673 --> 42:09.662
Thanks.

42:30.483 --> 42:32.074
Go home, Mark.

43:41.215 --> 43:43.613
This'll get your daughter through
the next 3 weeks.

43:43.816 --> 43:48.410
Make sure she uses the inhaler. Bring
her back if she's not feeling better.

43:51.954 --> 43:53.250
You bought this yourself?

43:58.289 --> 44:00.688
l'll get her to the clinic. l promise.

44:02.425 --> 44:03.686
Thank you.

44:04.726 --> 44:05.987
You're welcome.

44:28.537 --> 44:29.696
Honey?

44:31.538 --> 44:33.095
What time is it?

44:33.305 --> 44:34.896
Seven-thirty.

44:37.774 --> 44:40.707
l was just thinking about Milwaukee.

44:42.042 --> 44:44.009
And l know it'll be hard.

44:44.210 --> 44:46.040
That's okay. Don't worry about it.

44:46.244 --> 44:49.212
But if you want me to go...

44:50.180 --> 44:51.441
...l'll go.

44:57.617 --> 44:58.844
l'll go.

45:02.019 --> 45:04.076
No, you'd hate it.

45:06.187 --> 45:08.086
lt's not a big deal.

45:08.288 --> 45:10.551
lt's only two hours away.

45:16.258 --> 45:17.781
l love you.

45:21.327 --> 45:22.691
l love you too.

45:23.295 --> 45:25.387
Daddy, you're home!

45:27.697 --> 45:29.425
Hi, sweetheart.

45:30.064 --> 45:31.655
Come on in.

45:34.634 --> 45:35.895
Come here.

45:39.502 --> 45:42.231
l'm so glad to see you.

45:42.903 --> 45:45.234
Daddy, what's wrong?

45:46.238 --> 45:47.762
Nothing's wrong.

45:56.076 --> 45:57.633
Nothing's wrong.

46:01.579 --> 46:03.011
Nothing's wrong.

46:03.580 --> 46:04.568
Okay?
