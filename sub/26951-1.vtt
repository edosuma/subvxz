01:53.520 --> 01:57.020

02:00.834 --> 02:03.334

03:39.865 --> 03:44.865
(birds chirping)
(light music)

03:59.333 --> 04:02.333
- The departed don't hear us, Talli.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.693
- I wish I were dead instead.

04:32.110 --> 04:33.860
How is this possible?

04:40.090 --> 04:43.007
(doorbell ringing)

04:44.693 --> 04:45.526
- Talli?

04:46.434 --> 04:49.014
Open the door, please.

04:49.014 --> 04:52.181
(loud pulsing)
- Oh...

05:02.546 --> 05:05.129
(loud pulsing)

05:14.363 --> 05:15.196
Mom?

05:16.542 --> 05:17.375
Mom!

06:13.027 --> 06:18.027

(Talli groaning)

06:50.686 --> 06:53.411
(loud pulsing)

06:53.411 --> 06:54.244
Hey, help!

06:55.239 --> 06:57.207
I need your help!

06:57.207 --> 06:59.831
You, hey, can you call the police?

06:59.831 --> 07:00.664
Help!

07:03.699 --> 07:05.866
(sighing)

07:10.407 --> 07:12.074
I don't want to die.

07:13.899 --> 07:16.899
(suspenseful music)

07:35.559 --> 07:40.559
(loud pulsing)
(Talli gasping)

07:41.875 --> 07:44.125
(knocking)

07:45.339 --> 07:47.126
You can see me?

07:47.126 --> 07:48.834
- Happy birthday.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.862
Damian will be here any second.

07:50.862 --> 07:53.710
He told me that I should
send you to your room.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.468
- My room?
- Yes.

07:55.468 --> 07:57.732
He prepared his favorite room for you.

07:57.732 --> 07:59.649
Just for your birthday.

08:01.184 --> 08:04.484
Damian told me you were a vegetarian.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.830
I prepared a menu.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.156
I was just about to
give it the final touch,

08:08.156 --> 08:12.072
and when it's ready, I'll
get it up to the room.

08:12.072 --> 08:12.989
- Listen...

08:14.324 --> 08:15.596
You have to call the police.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.596
Damian wants to kill me.

08:18.491 --> 08:22.708
- Do you like ice cream or
chocolate souffle as dessert?

08:22.708 --> 08:24.372
- Are you listening?

08:24.372 --> 08:27.524
- You can tell me later when
I bring the main course.

08:27.524 --> 08:28.691
- He offed me!

08:34.063 --> 08:35.607
- Take one of these.

08:35.607 --> 08:36.802
They are delicious.

08:36.802 --> 08:38.102
(sweets clattering)

08:38.102 --> 08:41.436
- [Talli] I want you to call the police!

08:48.437 --> 08:49.854
- You're welcome.

09:13.249 --> 09:15.999
(match striking)

09:22.757 --> 09:23.757
Here you go.

09:25.128 --> 09:27.015
We had a short circuit
that was killing the power

09:27.015 --> 09:29.705
in some of the rooms last week.

09:29.705 --> 09:32.253
We're still waiting for the contractor.

09:32.253 --> 09:33.503
- Yeah, I know.

09:35.597 --> 09:39.273
- If you need anything else,
don't hesitate to call for me.

09:39.273 --> 09:42.409
But I'm pretty sure you will
have a wonderful evening.

09:42.409 --> 09:43.242
Right?

09:46.757 --> 09:49.257
(tense music)

10:09.393 --> 10:11.976
(loud pulsing)

10:43.263 --> 10:46.265
- Don't go in there, it's a trap!

10:46.265 --> 10:48.015
He wants to kill you!

11:02.029 --> 11:04.612
(door locking)

11:32.470 --> 11:34.720
(knocking)

11:36.980 --> 11:39.313
- Ready or not, here I come.

11:46.457 --> 11:49.987
I've been looking forward to this all day.

11:49.987 --> 11:52.494
(thunder rumbling)

11:52.494 --> 11:55.077
(sand pouring)

11:56.874 --> 11:59.874
(suspenseful music)

12:10.424 --> 12:11.674
- [Talli] Shit!

12:15.634 --> 12:18.717
- I brought you something, a present.

12:21.406 --> 12:22.334
- [Talli] You brought me something?

12:22.334 --> 12:25.459
- Of course darling, it's your birthday.

12:25.459 --> 12:26.978
Here.

12:26.978 --> 12:28.561
I hope you like it.

12:31.898 --> 12:34.065
- You're going to kill me.

12:42.534 --> 12:45.117
(loud pulsing)

12:46.402 --> 12:50.069
I have so much been
looking forward to this.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.894
Well now finally, here we are.

12:54.894 --> 12:55.727
Together.

12:57.882 --> 12:59.932
Come on baby, come on.

12:59.932 --> 13:00.765
This way.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.280
Wear it for me.

13:11.904 --> 13:14.821
(mysterious music)

14:46.885 --> 14:50.135
You have no idea how beautiful you are.

14:55.039 --> 14:55.872
Steamy.

14:59.811 --> 15:03.561
The tank top and the
hot pants are nice, too.

15:14.795 --> 15:16.715
(loud pulsing)

15:16.715 --> 15:17.548
- Talli!

15:26.703 --> 15:29.761
(phone buzzing)

15:29.761 --> 15:30.594
- Don't.

15:31.788 --> 15:33.862
- [Talli] Maybe it's Ann,
maybe it's important.

15:33.862 --> 15:37.043
- Yeah, well maybe, maybe
she's just jealous, huh?

15:37.043 --> 15:37.876
Maybe...

15:39.787 --> 15:42.263
It's because you're so cute.

15:42.263 --> 15:43.567
Maybe it's because you're smart.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.207
Or, maybe it's because you have me.

15:46.207 --> 15:47.379
- Yeah, I know, but maybe--

15:47.379 --> 15:48.443
- No.

15:48.443 --> 15:50.107
No but.

15:50.107 --> 15:53.439
These girls treat you
like shit all the time.

15:53.439 --> 15:54.291
You call them friends?

15:54.291 --> 15:56.919
They weren't there when
you most needed them.

15:56.919 --> 16:00.067
You gotta set priorities, Talli.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.959
Do you really want to jump
every time they call you

16:01.959 --> 16:05.959
for some shit, or would
you rather just kiss me?

16:07.537 --> 16:08.695
- What if it's my mom?

16:08.695 --> 16:10.423
- Oh, come on.

16:10.423 --> 16:12.823
It's just the same.

16:12.823 --> 16:15.191
She calls when she wants you
to run some errands for her.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.491
Hey, seriously, you gotta face it, Talli.

16:18.491 --> 16:19.495
She forgot your last birthday,

16:19.495 --> 16:22.254
she'll sure as hell forget your next.

16:22.254 --> 16:24.921
- She won't forget our birthday.

16:26.082 --> 16:27.332
- But I'm here.

16:30.310 --> 16:32.477
I am here for you, always.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.267
If you need anything, I'm here, hmm?

16:36.267 --> 16:40.267
They are not, not your
mother, not your friends.

16:42.415 --> 16:45.611
They don't understand the
pain of losing a child.

16:45.611 --> 16:49.811
They don't know what you're going through.

16:49.811 --> 16:50.644
But I do.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.644
I completely understand your loss.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.113
I know exactly how you feel.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.375
My son would have been five tomorrow,

17:07.375 --> 17:09.625
if he'd survived the chemo.

17:11.214 --> 17:12.762
- I should have known.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.596
The bastard was lying.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.762
You're right.

17:24.762 --> 17:25.596
I'm sorry.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.259
You're not mad at me, are you?

17:29.259 --> 17:30.547
- No.

17:30.547 --> 17:35.407
I have to say, although I'm
a bit disappointed in you.

17:35.407 --> 17:39.607
I think I know something
you can do about that.

17:39.607 --> 17:42.274
(both laughing)

17:44.032 --> 17:47.032
(breathing heavily)

17:50.631 --> 17:53.742
- Great, now he gets
exactly what he wanted.

17:53.742 --> 17:54.910
That liar!

17:54.910 --> 17:56.546
And you don't even fight.

17:56.546 --> 17:58.900
But you can't blame him
that you shut everyone out.

17:58.900 --> 18:03.101
Mom, our friends, you
knew he was playing you.

18:03.101 --> 18:06.700
You really wanna be dead, don't you?

18:06.700 --> 18:08.617
No responsibility, huh?

18:10.748 --> 18:14.165
I want the old Talli back, just for once.

18:16.732 --> 18:18.149
Please come back.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.918
Please come back.

18:29.033 --> 18:34.033
(Damian breathing heavily)
(tense music)

18:42.475 --> 18:44.597
(Damian screaming)

18:44.597 --> 18:47.514
(glass shattering)

18:57.052 --> 19:00.052
(breathing heavily)

19:06.231 --> 19:07.064
You?

19:08.152 --> 19:09.569
You're in prison.

19:12.580 --> 19:15.663
- What do you think this is, sweetie?

19:17.032 --> 19:19.532
You of all people should know.

19:23.572 --> 19:26.408
You look older than I remember you.

19:26.408 --> 19:30.325
(stepfather breathing heavily)

19:49.432 --> 19:50.432
- Help me...

20:10.417 --> 20:13.917
(Talli breathing heavily)

20:17.690 --> 20:20.440
(dramatic music)

20:58.320 --> 20:59.237
- You brat.

21:00.372 --> 21:03.060
You made them lock me up.

21:03.060 --> 21:06.297
Confess that you lied,
I never touched you.

21:06.297 --> 21:08.368
I never abused you.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.880
- I've seen mother's face
when you were done with her!

21:11.880 --> 21:13.484
- [Stepfather] Maybe.

21:13.484 --> 21:16.067
But I never laid a hand on you.

21:19.124 --> 21:22.964
- Aren't you even aware
of what you did to her?

21:22.964 --> 21:26.472
Do you know how often she
was crying because of you?

21:26.472 --> 21:30.028
It took her years to get
over father, and then you,

21:30.028 --> 21:34.692
of all men, you were the first
one she fell in love with.

21:34.692 --> 21:38.775
She trusted you, and you
beat her, and raped her.

21:40.108 --> 21:42.858
- Maybe, but I never touched you.

21:43.768 --> 21:44.952
What do you think they
do to people like that

21:44.952 --> 21:46.202
in prison, huh?

21:47.668 --> 21:50.335
I'm in prison, because you lied.

21:52.122 --> 21:53.356
Let me make it worth the lie,

21:53.356 --> 21:56.172
then at least I know why I'm here.

21:56.172 --> 21:59.339
(stepfather groaning)

22:00.508 --> 22:01.675
You fucking...

22:02.668 --> 22:04.001
You dirty bitch!

22:04.948 --> 22:05.781
Fuck!

22:08.951 --> 22:11.232
- That's for betraying mother.

22:11.232 --> 22:12.792
(spitting)

22:12.792 --> 22:14.968
You won't break me.

22:14.968 --> 22:16.218
- You think so?

22:24.328 --> 22:25.706
(pounding)

22:25.706 --> 22:27.732
- [Damian] I will break you!

22:27.732 --> 22:28.721
And you know what?

22:28.721 --> 22:31.721
It'll be the best moment of my life!

22:35.050 --> 22:37.512
- [Stepfather] We're all alone.

22:37.512 --> 22:39.333
- [Damian] No one will hear you.

22:39.333 --> 22:41.916
I'll do it slowly, very slowly.

22:43.437 --> 22:46.661
- He'll do the same to you
as I did to your mother.

22:46.661 --> 22:50.661
She didn't want to listen
either, just like you.

22:53.793 --> 22:55.601
I'm not done with you yet.

22:55.601 --> 22:58.378
(door breaking)

22:58.378 --> 22:59.628
- Yes, you are.

23:01.823 --> 23:04.323
(tense music)

23:09.680 --> 23:12.263
(loud pulsing)

23:21.053 --> 23:22.470
- Was it a dream?

23:23.869 --> 23:26.452
(sand pouring)

23:49.573 --> 23:50.906
That can't be...

23:54.869 --> 23:55.702
Talli?

23:57.629 --> 23:59.878
Your name's Talli, right?

23:59.878 --> 24:03.711
Actually Talita, but
everyone calls you Talli?

24:16.229 --> 24:19.812
(Young Talli blowing nose)

24:22.769 --> 24:27.019
My name's also Talita, but
everyone calls me Talli.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.721
Your mom promised to pick you up,

24:30.721 --> 24:33.781
but she didn't come, right?

24:33.781 --> 24:36.781
She's fighting with your stepfather.

24:38.025 --> 24:39.358
Don't be afraid.

24:40.485 --> 24:43.017
When I was your age, I also
waited for my mom one day

24:43.017 --> 24:44.833
and thought she wouldn't come.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.416
But she did, she was just late.

Run!

26:04.673 --> 26:07.006
Talli, you need to run away!

Fight, or he'll kill--

I have an offer for you, Talita.

28:23.378 --> 28:24.795
Give me the girl.

28:26.558 --> 28:28.070
Give me the girl and I'll let you live,

28:28.070 --> 28:30.987
but you have to give her to me now.

28:35.495 --> 28:38.745
It wasn't nice to kick me like you did.

28:45.306 --> 28:48.366
Look at the bright side, sweetie.

28:48.366 --> 28:50.378
You'll meet your dead baby
when I'm done with you.

28:50.378 --> 28:51.703
(laughing)

28:51.703 --> 28:55.632
Hey, call me an optimist, but
that's quite something, eh?

28:55.632 --> 28:58.199
But you're just gonna lose it anyway, huh?

28:58.199 --> 29:00.283
Bet you didn't want it.

29:00.283 --> 29:01.647
Runs in the family.

29:01.647 --> 29:03.959
Your mother didn't want you.

29:03.959 --> 29:07.079
Yeah, that's the reason why you lost it.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.419
How often did you hear
your precious mother

29:09.419 --> 29:14.169
tell your stepfather she wishes
you were never born, huh?

29:15.447 --> 29:16.375
I think you should thank me

29:16.375 --> 29:19.292
for bringing you two back together.

29:22.275 --> 29:23.108
Talita?

29:24.195 --> 29:25.862
Talita, come on out.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.228
I'm giving you a chance to make up for it.

29:31.228 --> 29:34.061
See your death as your reparation.

29:35.094 --> 29:36.761
Talita, come on out!

29:40.778 --> 29:41.611
- Run.

29:43.226 --> 29:45.638
- I'll bring you peace, I promise.

29:45.638 --> 29:48.638
(suspenseful music)

30:00.566 --> 30:02.983
For God's sake, stop running!

30:13.269 --> 30:14.186
- The door!

30:26.634 --> 30:29.222
(Talli struggling)

30:29.222 --> 30:30.713
Give her back!

30:30.713 --> 30:32.422
- You know what?

30:32.422 --> 30:34.776
Just play with your teddy bear, huh?

30:34.776 --> 30:37.191
The grown-ups need to talk.

30:37.191 --> 30:38.886
- You want me, not her!

30:38.886 --> 30:41.302
- [Damian] But she is you, darling.

30:41.302 --> 30:43.135
- Give her back to me!

30:50.394 --> 30:51.811
- I will end you.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.061
- You won't, and you
won't hurt her either!

31:01.674 --> 31:04.702
(Talli groaning)

31:04.702 --> 31:06.786
- I made my offer, and you declined.

31:06.786 --> 31:09.413
Almost tragic, don't you think?

31:09.413 --> 31:11.138
(Damian chuckling)

31:11.138 --> 31:13.971
(Damian groaning)

31:22.882 --> 31:25.632
(Talli groaning)

31:28.505 --> 31:31.574
(Damian laughing)

31:31.574 --> 31:35.052
That didn't work out quite
the way you expected, did it?

31:35.052 --> 31:36.088
Oh, how I'll kill her?

31:36.088 --> 31:38.474
I dunno, um, I think I'll enjoy it.

31:38.474 --> 31:40.350
I'll do it slowly, yeah.

31:40.350 --> 31:41.729
- Don't touch her!

31:41.729 --> 31:44.729
- Oh darling, no need to be jealous.

31:45.933 --> 31:50.933
You'll be next, sweetie.
(Talli breathing heavily)

31:53.578 --> 31:55.578
- Turn around, run away!

31:57.642 --> 31:59.200
Don't trust him!

31:59.200 --> 32:00.635
Run!

32:00.635 --> 32:01.468
(Damian laughing)

32:01.468 --> 32:03.368
- [Damian] Come on, sweetie.

32:37.865 --> 32:38.698
- Julia?

32:40.729 --> 32:41.896
You're dead...

32:46.761 --> 32:47.844
What is this?

32:50.699 --> 32:53.449
(timer clicking)

32:58.432 --> 33:00.180
All right, listen.

33:00.180 --> 33:02.304
There's a man upstairs who
kidnapped a little girl.

33:02.304 --> 33:03.520
He will kill her.

33:03.520 --> 33:06.770
We need to help her, do you understand?

33:08.124 --> 33:11.643
(soft crunching)

33:11.643 --> 33:14.645
Can you just stop eating for
a moment and listen to me?

33:14.645 --> 33:16.978
This guy will kill the girl!

33:20.392 --> 33:22.088
Julia, you have to help me!

33:22.088 --> 33:24.921
(bowl clattering)

33:30.740 --> 33:33.490
(soft crunching)

33:35.556 --> 33:37.536
All right, get up.

33:37.536 --> 33:39.078
Get up, you have to help me.

33:39.078 --> 33:43.078
You've got to save the
girl, we need to save me!

33:47.076 --> 33:49.743
Please, Julia, I need your help.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.424
I can't do this on my own.

33:54.424 --> 33:55.740
Once we're out the door, we talk.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.680
I explain everything, okay?

33:57.680 --> 33:59.013
I promise, okay?

34:02.537 --> 34:05.524
(cereal crinkling)

34:05.524 --> 34:08.274
(soft crunching)

34:12.860 --> 34:14.443
I'm on my own, huh?

34:24.004 --> 34:25.504
That's just great.

34:27.813 --> 34:29.152
(tool clattering)

34:29.152 --> 34:30.567
Why won't you open?

34:30.567 --> 34:35.567
(dramatic music)
(timer clicking)

34:35.775 --> 34:38.422
I don't care how long it'll take,

34:38.422 --> 34:40.838
I won't give up, you hear me?

34:40.838 --> 34:42.005
I'll save you!

34:48.799 --> 34:49.966
I'll save you.

34:50.873 --> 34:52.623
Just hang in there...

35:22.518 --> 35:23.351
Julia?

35:25.130 --> 35:27.274
Is this how it happened?

35:27.274 --> 35:28.357
How you died?

35:30.122 --> 35:32.870
Why didn't you talk to me?

35:32.870 --> 35:35.370
- I didn't want to bother you.

35:36.290 --> 35:39.540
- So you just went and killed yourself?

35:40.583 --> 35:43.309
- [Julia] Was it hard on my parents?

35:43.309 --> 35:44.142
- It was.

35:45.007 --> 35:46.174
For all of us.

35:47.571 --> 35:48.571
- I'm sorry.

35:54.503 --> 35:59.031
- There is no way we get
the pills out of you now?

35:59.031 --> 36:01.781
(dramatic music)

36:10.523 --> 36:13.191
I've been asking myself

36:13.191 --> 36:16.823
if there is anything I
could have done differently.

36:16.823 --> 36:17.656
- No.

36:20.193 --> 36:24.784
Actually, I wish I would
have asked for your help.

36:24.784 --> 36:25.617
I just...

36:26.647 --> 36:27.480
I didn't.

36:33.066 --> 36:35.899
- You'll always be my best friend.

37:14.723 --> 37:16.140
Why are you here?

37:17.091 --> 37:19.841
What is it that you want from me?

37:28.071 --> 37:30.821
(dramatic music)

37:40.775 --> 37:43.608
(sobbing quietly)

38:19.444 --> 38:21.383
- [Damian] Talli, open up.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.971
(pounding)

38:22.971 --> 38:27.095
Doesn't matter how far
you run, I'll get you.

38:27.095 --> 38:29.012
You can't hide from me.

38:30.051 --> 38:32.301
(pounding)

38:35.723 --> 38:37.941
Open the goddamn door!

38:37.941 --> 38:39.191
- [Talli] Stop!

38:40.867 --> 38:41.700
- Hey.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.871
What are you doing here?

38:46.871 --> 38:51.871
(dramatic music)
(Talli crying)

38:58.603 --> 38:59.436
Shh.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.411
What is it?

39:02.411 --> 39:04.328
- He won't stop.
- What?

39:06.159 --> 39:09.131
- The banging, don't you hear it?

39:09.131 --> 39:10.855
He's after me, he wants to kill me.

39:10.855 --> 39:12.712
(pounding)

39:12.712 --> 39:15.443
You don't hear the banging?

39:15.443 --> 39:17.843
Tell me that you hear it too.

39:17.843 --> 39:20.771
- Babe, I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:20.771 --> 39:22.823
I just heard my mum open
the door for you downstairs.

39:22.823 --> 39:26.951
And the next moment, you
literally stormed into my bedroom.

39:26.951 --> 39:29.451
- No, no, it wasn't like that.

39:31.151 --> 39:34.690
This isn't real, this is a dream.

39:34.690 --> 39:36.611
This isn't real.

39:36.611 --> 39:38.155
Nothing here is real.

39:38.155 --> 39:40.691
I can't do this again.

39:40.691 --> 39:43.179
- What are you talking about?

39:43.179 --> 39:45.175
Babe, is this about us?

39:45.175 --> 39:46.842
Let's talk about it.

39:48.835 --> 39:51.131
- No, no, I can't go through this again.

39:51.131 --> 39:52.119
Don't you get it?

39:52.119 --> 39:54.119
It won't change a thing.

39:55.839 --> 39:58.075
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

39:58.075 --> 40:00.835
- Babe, I-I know you suffer.

40:00.835 --> 40:02.679
Jeez, look, I feel
terrible about it myself,

40:02.679 --> 40:06.096
but we're not to blame for what happened.

40:08.019 --> 40:10.186
Come here, let's sit down.

40:12.532 --> 40:13.823
- None of this is real.

40:13.823 --> 40:15.219
You aren't real.

40:15.219 --> 40:17.471
Nothing here is real!

40:17.471 --> 40:18.442
What's next, huh?

40:18.442 --> 40:19.275
Tell me!

40:19.275 --> 40:21.071
What else can you show me?

40:21.071 --> 40:23.271
Do I really have to go
through this hell again?

40:23.271 --> 40:28.271
♪ All I ever wanted was just
the freedom to breathe ♪

40:29.388 --> 40:33.902

40:37.908 --> 40:41.491

don't have to remind me.

40:45.009 --> 40:46.676
Please, not again...

40:48.234 --> 40:49.734

40:56.914 --> 40:59.120
I'll always love you.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.734
I know if we stick together,
if we help each other,

41:02.734 --> 41:05.317
we can start over, we can heal.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.417
You and me.

41:08.796 --> 41:10.879
You're Bonnie, I'm Clyde.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.649
- Stop.

41:14.649 --> 41:16.981
- What do you expect of me then?

41:16.981 --> 41:20.188
You don't call, you
won't pick up your phone.

41:20.188 --> 41:23.080
Your mother promises that
she'll forward my messages.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.113
But you don't even have time
for her anymore, do you?

41:27.113 --> 41:28.770

Stop!

42:07.078 --> 42:08.379
Don't open it.

42:10.211 --> 42:11.044
- No!

42:11.998 --> 42:13.738

You better not make me regret

48:31.798 --> 48:34.715
You answer my questions, all right?

48:37.345 --> 48:38.345
Who are you?

48:44.246 --> 48:46.496
- It doesn't matter, Talli.

48:48.898 --> 48:51.926
- [Talli] How do you know my name?

48:51.926 --> 48:54.676

49:15.534 --> 49:18.867
- [Josephine] You're fucking my husband.

49:21.038 --> 49:21.871
- Damian?

49:23.274 --> 49:24.441
I didn't know.

49:25.913 --> 49:28.854
- If you had known, would
that have stopped you?

49:28.854 --> 49:31.604
Would that have changed anything?

49:32.954 --> 49:36.598
You're just like all the other girls,

49:36.598 --> 49:40.902
so impressed with his castle and his cars.

49:40.902 --> 49:42.485
His sophistication.

49:43.615 --> 49:46.615
He really had you fooled, didn't he?

49:47.610 --> 49:49.610
- I thought it was love.

49:51.270 --> 49:52.437
- Don't worry.

Me too.

50:14.174 --> 50:16.257
- No hard feelings, then.

50:20.482 --> 50:22.065
- No hard feelings.

50:23.734 --> 50:24.567
- Okay.

50:26.254 --> 50:29.087
Then I guess I'll leave you to it.

50:30.634 --> 50:34.717
- You think you can just
walk away from all this?

50:36.126 --> 50:37.385
- Why not?

50:37.385 --> 50:38.962
- Because you let him in,

50:38.962 --> 50:42.332
and now he'll always
know where to find you.

50:42.332 --> 50:45.487
You don't know him like I do.

50:45.487 --> 50:47.570
He's a psychopath, Talli.

50:48.789 --> 50:50.753
And you're in his realm.

50:50.753 --> 50:52.753
You can't beat him here.

50:56.065 --> 50:56.898
- Help me.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.257
I can't do it alone.

51:03.832 --> 51:05.082
- I don't know.

51:06.848 --> 51:08.785
- It doesn't matter.

51:08.785 --> 51:11.068
It's a dream, isn't it?

51:11.068 --> 51:14.005
- It's much more than that.

51:14.005 --> 51:17.588
If he kills you in
here, you die out there.

51:20.816 --> 51:22.708
- [Talli] I thought nothing here counts.

51:22.708 --> 51:24.458
- Not for me anymore.

51:26.248 --> 51:28.415
But it still does for you.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.568
You're still alive.

51:36.568 --> 51:38.636
He can't control you yet.

51:38.636 --> 51:41.386
(dramatic music)

51:45.884 --> 51:46.717
Shoot him.

51:49.016 --> 51:51.766
(carousel music)

51:53.308 --> 51:55.939
(Damian laughing)
(Talli gasping)

51:55.939 --> 51:57.856
- Thank you, Josephine.

52:00.991 --> 52:02.620
(blows breath)

52:02.620 --> 52:04.116
(Josephine gasping)

52:04.116 --> 52:09.116
(Damian laughing)
(suspenseful music)

52:11.016 --> 52:13.516
Ah, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.

52:17.283 --> 52:19.283
Don't fight it, sweetie.

52:22.684 --> 52:24.101
It's nearly done.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.707
(Talli choking)

52:43.716 --> 52:45.716
Come on, don't fight it.

52:47.556 --> 52:48.920
It's nearly done, sweetie.

52:48.920 --> 52:51.587
(Talli gasping)

52:58.956 --> 53:01.456
- [Josephine] Leave her alone!

53:02.869 --> 53:05.702
(Damian groaning)

53:08.201 --> 53:11.700
(glass clattering)

53:11.700 --> 53:14.783
(Josephine groaning)

53:22.652 --> 53:23.485
- Hey...

53:26.220 --> 53:27.053
Oh my God.

53:28.544 --> 53:30.211
You're so beautiful.

53:33.720 --> 53:36.387
(loud thudding)

54:05.747 --> 54:08.080
(chuckling)

54:12.091 --> 54:15.032
Now finally, it's your turn.

54:15.032 --> 54:16.449
What a hunt, huh?

54:17.476 --> 54:19.009
I like it.

54:19.009 --> 54:21.278
It's almost a shame it's over now.

54:21.278 --> 54:24.700
It'll be hard to find a
worthy successor for you.

54:24.700 --> 54:25.867
You know what?

54:27.361 --> 54:29.545
Maybe I should let you get away, yeah?

54:29.545 --> 54:32.289
You know, let you live with the fear

54:32.289 --> 54:36.921
that I could always get to
you any moment, unexpectedly.

54:36.921 --> 54:41.377
Just letting you know that I'm
always having an eye on you.

54:41.377 --> 54:43.405
I would enjoy your fear.

54:43.405 --> 54:45.655
(laughing)

54:57.565 --> 55:00.315
(match striking)

55:09.277 --> 55:10.360
- Tick, tock.

55:11.617 --> 55:12.534
Tick, tock.

55:13.569 --> 55:14.819
Time's running.

55:16.793 --> 55:18.710
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

55:19.807 --> 55:21.224
Time's almost up.

55:22.283 --> 55:24.033
It won't be long now.

55:26.467 --> 55:27.384
Pure flame.

55:28.519 --> 55:29.852
Beautiful flame.

55:30.831 --> 55:32.414
Gentle little fire.

55:36.875 --> 55:38.287
Ouch!

55:38.287 --> 55:39.561
Mean flame.

55:39.561 --> 55:41.603
Mean little fire.

55:41.603 --> 55:45.035
(match striking)

55:45.035 --> 55:45.952
Tick, tock.

55:47.112 --> 55:48.029
Tick, tock.

55:49.992 --> 55:51.242
Time's running.

55:52.888 --> 55:54.880
- [Talli] Who are you?

55:54.880 --> 55:55.713
- Mmm...

55:56.816 --> 55:58.316
Time is almost up.

55:59.472 --> 56:01.222
It won't be long now.

56:02.857 --> 56:05.607
(dramatic music)

56:07.648 --> 56:10.919
(match striking)

56:10.919 --> 56:13.252
You made a nice little fire?

56:17.613 --> 56:19.086
- Where am I?

56:19.086 --> 56:21.230
And who are you?

56:21.230 --> 56:22.480
- I don't know.

56:24.754 --> 56:27.254
- You don't know where we are?

56:28.623 --> 56:31.086
- Where could we be?

56:31.086 --> 56:32.169
Looks like...

56:34.025 --> 56:35.192
Nowhere to me.

56:38.374 --> 56:39.957
- What's your name?

56:41.506 --> 56:44.058
(match striking)

56:44.058 --> 56:47.942
- Um, I don't, I don't
think that is important.

56:47.942 --> 56:51.842
If-if you're nowhere, you can't be there.

56:51.842 --> 56:55.342
And your name doesn't matter now, does it?

56:57.918 --> 56:58.938
- I'm Talli.

56:58.938 --> 56:59.940
Talita.

56:59.940 --> 57:02.023
I'm 19, and I'm somebody.

57:04.786 --> 57:06.302
- No.

57:06.302 --> 57:08.358
You're nobody too.

57:08.358 --> 57:11.025
You don't have anybody, like me.

57:12.002 --> 57:13.666
You're nobody.

57:13.666 --> 57:16.333
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

57:18.046 --> 57:20.323
- Of course I'm somebody.

57:20.323 --> 57:23.234
I have a mother and friends.

57:23.234 --> 57:25.938
You were born at some
point, so you're somebody.

57:25.938 --> 57:30.663
Maybe I don't know where
we are, but we'll get out.

57:30.663 --> 57:31.496
- No.

57:31.496 --> 57:33.610
This is, this is nonsense.

57:33.610 --> 57:35.770
Why am I talking to you anyway?

57:35.770 --> 57:36.937
You're nobody.

57:38.056 --> 57:39.973
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

57:42.284 --> 57:43.534
Time's running.

57:45.030 --> 57:46.947
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

57:48.862 --> 57:49.695
- Stop it!

57:53.568 --> 57:55.735
(gasping)

57:57.212 --> 57:58.712
Can you feel that?

58:00.122 --> 58:01.455
I can touch you.

58:02.614 --> 58:05.447
That means I exist, and so do you.

58:07.216 --> 58:08.716
Tell me your name.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.934
- Once I...

58:12.934 --> 58:14.017
I had a name.

58:17.026 --> 58:18.443
I-I was somebody.

58:21.978 --> 58:24.311
- You can be somebody again.

58:28.338 --> 58:29.806
- I...

58:29.806 --> 58:31.806
I can be somebody again.

58:40.338 --> 58:42.755
- [Talli] Is your name Talli?

58:43.604 --> 58:44.986
- Talli?

58:44.986 --> 58:47.236
What a, what a pretty name.

58:49.126 --> 58:50.709
Is-is that my name?

58:52.038 --> 58:53.926
- Yes, you're Talli.

58:53.926 --> 58:55.233
And you still are.

58:55.233 --> 58:57.602
You were born with that
name, and you won't lose it.

58:57.602 --> 58:58.435
Say it.

58:59.418 --> 59:02.168
(match striking)

59:03.514 --> 59:04.858
- Talli.

59:04.858 --> 59:06.994
My name is Talli.

59:06.994 --> 59:09.577
(gentle music)

59:22.885 --> 59:25.218
I-I-I have a name!

59:27.117 --> 59:28.450
- I have a name.

59:29.638 --> 59:31.258
That means I'm somebody.

59:31.258 --> 59:34.210
- That-that means I am somebody.

59:34.210 --> 59:37.543
I can't be nobody if, if I have a name.

59:38.742 --> 59:41.825
- I can't be nobody if I have a name.

59:43.041 --> 59:47.624
I have a name, and I have a
voice, and I won't give up!

01:00:27.229 --> 01:00:29.979
(dramatic music)

01:01:05.494 --> 01:01:07.853
- [Damian] Looking for something?

01:01:07.853 --> 01:01:10.281
I got rid of all the weapons.

01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:12.785
You know it's pointless, don't you?

01:01:12.785 --> 01:01:16.477
This is my world, I decide
what happens in here.

01:01:16.477 --> 01:01:19.761
You can't change a damn thing.

01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:20.945
(Damian laughing)

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:22.865
Come on, come on, give it a try.

01:01:22.865 --> 01:01:23.698
Come on.

01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:26.821
- We'll see.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:43.590
- Boo.
(Talli gasping)

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:45.390
(Damian laughing)

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:46.973
My world, my rules.

01:01:49.479 --> 01:01:53.812
Only thing is, you're not
behaving as I wish you to.

01:01:56.531 --> 01:01:58.411
(loud pulsing)

01:01:58.411 --> 01:01:59.772
- Shh, Talli.

01:01:59.772 --> 01:02:02.105
Talli, Talli, shh, shh, shh.

01:02:04.219 --> 01:02:06.163
Why are you still fighting, huh?

01:02:06.163 --> 01:02:09.008
It makes no sense, seriously.

01:02:09.008 --> 01:02:10.477
Why do you insist on fighting?

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:11.310
I don't get it.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:14.432
- You're asking me why
I fight for my life?

01:02:14.432 --> 01:02:16.112
- Well, yes.

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:18.152
Death is inevitable.

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.109
The others got that, I
mean, they just accepted it.

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:21.109
Why don't...

01:02:22.991 --> 01:02:24.771
Ah, you know what?

01:02:24.771 --> 01:02:26.395
Maybe, maybe you're just stupid.

01:02:26.395 --> 01:02:27.478
Is it that?

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:30.891
Is it possible you got a
learning disability or something?

01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:32.027
- You prick.

01:02:32.027 --> 01:02:32.860
- Oh.

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:35.366
Now have a look.

01:02:37.743 --> 01:02:39.863
- That's my--
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:39.863 --> 01:02:41.543
These are my thoughts.

01:02:41.543 --> 01:02:44.043
This here is my perfect world.

01:02:45.007 --> 01:02:47.001
And I decide what happens,

01:02:47.001 --> 01:02:50.168
and I decide who's allowed to be here.

01:02:51.773 --> 01:02:54.690
(Alexander cooing)

01:02:57.171 --> 01:03:00.595
And well, yes, I can do with
your son what I want to do.

01:03:00.595 --> 01:03:02.635
You got no power in here, little girl.

01:03:02.635 --> 01:03:04.052
This is my realm.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.832
- This is your realm?

01:03:06.832 --> 01:03:08.165
I'm in your head.

01:03:08.165 --> 01:03:09.759
Which means I can harm you.

01:03:09.759 --> 01:03:11.284
- Oh, can you now?

01:03:11.284 --> 01:03:12.415
Well, you know what?

01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:14.748
Be my guest, give it a shot.

01:03:17.704 --> 01:03:19.493
- If these are all your thoughts,

01:03:19.493 --> 01:03:22.195
why is your wife still alive, huh?

01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:24.607
I saw how you killed her.

01:03:24.607 --> 01:03:25.959
And Alex, why is he here?

01:03:25.959 --> 01:03:28.642
Why do you want me to see all of this?

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:31.559
(Damian chuckling)

01:03:34.379 --> 01:03:35.831
- Your thoughts, Talli,

01:03:35.831 --> 01:03:38.935
your thoughts are-are different than mine.

01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:40.599
This here, this is all my creation,

01:03:40.599 --> 01:03:42.860
you're in my house, my home.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.637
It's clean, bright and tidy.

01:03:45.637 --> 01:03:48.180
Everything's well-balanced.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.513
This is harmony.

01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:54.947
In your world, we met
your evil stepfather,

01:03:54.947 --> 01:03:57.120
who you damned to live
a life in prison, huh?

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.037
We met your childish,
shy, insecure little self

01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:06.407
who couldn't fight even if
her life depended on it.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.514
We met your stupid best friend,

01:04:09.514 --> 01:04:11.899
whose pain you ignored,
which drove her into suicide.

01:04:11.899 --> 01:04:13.655
And last but not least,

01:04:13.655 --> 01:04:16.655
we met your fool of an ex-boyfriend,

01:04:17.794 --> 01:04:19.627
whose heart you broke,

01:04:20.926 --> 01:04:23.176
and whose child you killed.

01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:26.876
Tears.

01:04:27.843 --> 01:04:28.676
Blood.

01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:30.928
Death.

01:04:33.527 --> 01:04:35.110
You destroy things.

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:39.167
You bring chaos, hardship and pain

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:42.380
upon those who love you and upon yourself.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.713
But now, I am offering you a home, yeah?

01:04:47.103 --> 01:04:51.736
I, I am offering you
redemption from your sins.

01:04:51.736 --> 01:04:53.400
Why don't you just take it?

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.099
Please say yes, Talli.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.719
Just take it.

01:04:56.719 --> 01:04:58.636
Please, please take it!

01:05:01.143 --> 01:05:03.976
(Damian laughing)

01:05:07.759 --> 01:05:09.092
What's going on?

01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:12.379
Has the cat got your tongue?

01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:13.879
Did you realize...

01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:23.965
- I was here...

01:05:27.988 --> 01:05:30.238
I was here a long time ago.

01:05:37.231 --> 01:05:42.231
- I visited all those places
to remind myself of something.

01:05:42.779 --> 01:05:44.279
I made a vow once.

01:05:45.899 --> 01:05:47.566
- I was here before.

01:05:56.116 --> 01:05:57.866
No, that's not right.

01:05:59.159 --> 01:06:01.826
That's not, that's not his baby.

01:06:08.055 --> 01:06:09.388
- Wait a minute.

01:06:12.419 --> 01:06:14.999
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.036
These are my thoughts.

01:06:16.036 --> 01:06:18.526
This is, this is, this
is my-my perfect world.

01:06:18.526 --> 01:06:21.776
I decide what's wrong and what's right.

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:26.371
- I made a vow that I won't
let anyone ever treat me

01:06:26.371 --> 01:06:27.454
like you did.

01:06:30.358 --> 01:06:33.191
I forgot that, but I now remember.

01:06:34.815 --> 01:06:37.335
You created this world
because in real life,

01:06:37.335 --> 01:06:40.831
you're just a sad little
man who hates himself.

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:43.275
And now that I think about, Damian,

01:06:43.275 --> 01:06:47.551
I think it's fair enough to
say that no one likes you.

01:06:47.551 --> 01:06:48.968
You're all alone.

01:06:50.775 --> 01:06:52.358
- You just shut up!

01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:55.601
- This is your world.

01:06:56.987 --> 01:06:57.820
Make me.

01:07:03.495 --> 01:07:05.636
She can't see you, can she?

01:07:05.636 --> 01:07:09.719
'Cause if she could, she
would rip you to shreds.

01:07:17.327 --> 01:07:18.160
Josephine?

01:07:30.378 --> 01:07:31.878
- You murdered me.

01:07:33.406 --> 01:07:36.559
You're a liar, a thief and a fraud.

01:07:36.559 --> 01:07:37.954
And I hate you.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:41.260
- [Damian] No, no, no,
this is not how it works.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.622
I'm not responsible for your fuck-up.

01:07:43.622 --> 01:07:45.417
It's your own goddamn
fault, both of yours.

01:07:45.417 --> 01:07:47.391
- (laughs) Oh, right.

01:07:47.391 --> 01:07:48.974
So I killed myself?

01:07:51.111 --> 01:07:52.311
You're pathetic.

01:07:52.311 --> 01:07:53.144
Isn't he?

01:07:54.247 --> 01:07:58.015
- I have no idea how I fell for him.

01:07:58.015 --> 01:08:01.915
Stay in your dream world, if you like.

01:08:01.915 --> 01:08:06.895
None of this is real if
you're nothing but a fraud.

01:08:06.895 --> 01:08:07.823
- No!

01:08:07.823 --> 01:08:12.823
(Talli gasping)
(Damian groaning)

01:08:17.147 --> 01:08:19.201
Oh my God, what's going on?

01:08:19.201 --> 01:08:20.890
This is impossible!

01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:22.082
What the hell?

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:24.607
(tense music)

01:08:24.607 --> 01:08:27.439
(Damian laughing)

01:08:32.423 --> 01:08:34.673
Oh baby, you really got me.

01:08:35.962 --> 01:08:37.939
You got some fighting spirit.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:38.772
Oh my God.

01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:43.870
God, you're beautiful.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.620
You're so, you're so beautiful...

01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:05.501
(groaning)

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.033
What's going on?

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.703
I'm losing my thoughts.

01:09:14.703 --> 01:09:16.096
These are my goddamn thoughts.

01:09:16.096 --> 01:09:17.514
These are my, oh!

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:22.139
- You hit me, I'm unconscious,

01:09:22.139 --> 01:09:24.305
and poof, here I am again.

01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:27.077
Cool, isn't it?

01:09:27.926 --> 01:09:30.176
I'm getting the hang of it.

01:09:31.211 --> 01:09:34.544
Don't worry, we're just getting started.

01:09:35.831 --> 01:09:37.439
- This is gonna be fun.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.251
(Josephine chuckling)

01:09:39.251 --> 01:09:40.826
- [Talli] Oh, yes.

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:43.576
(dramatic music)

01:09:47.756 --> 01:09:49.944
- Run, you coward.

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:51.194
We'll find you!

01:09:55.404 --> 01:09:57.369
This is your world now.

01:09:57.369 --> 01:10:00.119
And you can't hide from yourself.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.364
You need to be strong and fight.

01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:06.531
I'll help you.

01:10:10.512 --> 01:10:12.864
(Damian groaning)

01:10:12.864 --> 01:10:13.871
- No, these are my thoughts.

01:10:13.871 --> 01:10:15.577
These are my thoughts, this is my world.

01:10:15.577 --> 01:10:17.080
My thoughts in my head!

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:17.913
This is--

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:21.066
(groaning loudly)

01:10:21.066 --> 01:10:22.516
Oh no, no!

01:10:22.516 --> 01:10:24.092
No, get out of my head!

01:10:24.092 --> 01:10:27.509
Goddamn bitches, get out of my, out of...

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.063
My goddamn head!

01:10:30.922 --> 01:10:33.755
(groaning loudly)

01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:49.371
(sand pouring)

01:11:08.516 --> 01:11:11.266
(birds chirping)

01:11:28.854 --> 01:11:31.884
- [Josephine] Hello, darling.

01:11:31.884 --> 01:11:33.261
Comfy?

01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:36.011
(Damian gasping)

01:11:41.503 --> 01:11:42.604
- Where am I?

01:11:42.604 --> 01:11:45.836
- You're right where we want you to be.

01:11:45.836 --> 01:11:49.169
And there's nothing you can do about it.

01:11:50.277 --> 01:11:52.663
This might hurt a little bit.

01:11:52.663 --> 01:11:56.246
(Damian breathing heavily)

01:11:58.787 --> 01:12:01.704
(Damian screaming)

01:12:03.467 --> 01:12:06.217
(birds chirping)

01:12:38.713 --> 01:12:41.713
(breathing heavily)

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:55.117
(light gentle music)

01:13:25.384 --> 01:13:26.217
- Goodbye.

01:13:37.232 --> 01:13:38.065
Sebastian?

01:13:38.944 --> 01:13:40.611
Hey, it's me, Talli.

01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:43.064
I thought...

01:13:45.152 --> 01:13:48.016
Do you wanna meet up for coffee?

01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:49.433
It would be nice.

01:13:50.408 --> 01:13:51.241
Okay.

01:13:54.762 --> 01:13:58.095
(gentle sweeping music)

01:16:09.433 --> 01:16:12.350
