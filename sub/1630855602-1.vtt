00:35.291 --> 00:38.416
<i>It was a storybook ceremony
today inside Westminster Abbey,</i>

00:38.416 --> 00:42.416
<i>where the future king of England,
Prince Philip, Duke of Cambridge,</i>

00:42.416 --> 00:46.208
<i>married his childhood sweetheart,
Lady Martha Fitzroy.</i>

00:46.208 --> 00:50.291
<i>Thousands came to cheer the couple
and to cheer the prince's younger brother,</i>

00:50.291 --> 00:55.375
<i>Prince Henry, known affectionately as
"Prince of England's Hearts,"</i>

00:55.375 --> 00:57.875
<i>and their younger sister,
Princess Beatrice,</i>

00:57.875 --> 00:59.875
<i>whom all the world adores.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:03.583
<i>The wedding reception boasts
a who's who of international guests,</i>

01:03.583 --> 01:06.208
<i>including Alex Claremont-Diaz,</i>

01:06.208 --> 01:10.208
<i>the charismatic son
of the American president.</i>

01:10.208 --> 01:12.375
Also representing
the U.S. is Nora Holleran,

01:12.375 --> 01:14.250
- the vice president's granddaughter.

01:14.250 --> 01:15.458
She's talking about us.

01:15.458 --> 01:19.833
Mr. Claremont-Diaz is often referred
to as "the American Prince Henry."

01:22.125 --> 01:23.875
Hey. Here's an idea.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.750
How about we skip the party tonight
and go do touristy things instead?

01:27.750 --> 01:29.458
No. Are you crazy?

01:29.458 --> 01:32.333
I want to see Buckingham Palace,
don't you?

01:32.333 --> 01:34.250
Mm.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.666
Okay, you've been yucking my yum all day.

01:36.666 --> 01:37.833
What's going on with you?

01:42.250 --> 01:45.791
It's... it's the whole
Prince Henry comparison thing.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.083
Mm.

01:52.041 --> 01:55.208
He's spent his entire life
attending fancy events like this.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.541
He was trained for this.

01:59.250 --> 02:03.166
I feel like if I use the wrong fork
at dinner, they're just...

02:03.166 --> 02:05.500
gonna eat me alive.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.875
Just remember, you're handsome
and charming and everyone loves you.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.333
It's nice to see you again.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.916
When the revolution happens,
it will be because of this wedding.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.041
Oh, shut up, Henry,
and get into the spirit of the thing.

02:30.041 --> 02:32.333
- Oh, hello. Hi.
- Oh, hello.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.416
The cake alone costs 75,000 pounds.

02:37.416 --> 02:39.958
They practically had to break the doors
down to get it inside. -

02:39.958 --> 02:41.375
It's obscene.

02:43.166 --> 02:48.041
You're not gonna want to hear this,
but that Prince Henry is so yummy.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.333
Nora, no.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.833
- He's such a snob.
- I don't know, man.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.541
If I was gonna go for a rich white boy,
that is the rich white boy I'd go for.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.625
But he's the worst kind of rich white boy.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.541
So smug and entitled.

02:58.541 --> 03:01.416
He's a prince, Alex.
He's literally entitled.

03:01.416 --> 03:04.208
- Oh, you know what is obscene?
- Hmm?

03:04.208 --> 03:06.125
Is how attractive the president's son is.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.750
Have you ever met him?

03:07.750 --> 03:09.208
Yes, a few times.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.708
He's very... animated.

03:11.708 --> 03:12.916
He's the world's rudest person.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.000
He's the world's most irritating person.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.458
Also, I swear that he is not six-two.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.541
It's wonderful to see you.

03:19.541 --> 03:21.041
Nice to meet you as well.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.625
- I have heard so much about you.
- Oh-oh.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.333
You're sticking with me tonight.
Come on. Here we go.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.208
How's it going?

04:03.875 --> 04:06.458
Ooh, I'll take that.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.041
Oh, that's nice.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.500
Henry!

04:20.500 --> 04:21.916
What's up?

04:21.916 --> 04:24.583
Long time no see.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.500
Alex.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.958
Killer wedding, man.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.500
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.958
Ah, yeah.
Who doesn't love a little Mozart?

04:34.458 --> 04:36.000
Actually, it's Schubert.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.208
Although you got to wonder
how many families

04:39.208 --> 04:42.208
you could feed with what this cake cost.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.416
Probably not as many as if
we put your shoes on auction.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.375
Rude.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.458
Hello there.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.625
Tell me something, Your Majesty.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.208
Magnificent day.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.000
Yes, Alex?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.958
Uh, did your parents send you
to snobbery school

04:56.958 --> 04:59.666
or does looking down on people
just come naturally to you?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.333
Well, in your case,
I would say it's rather inevitable.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.125
- We are the same height!
- If you say so, Alex.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.041
- Great to see you.
- You, too, Your Majesty.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.958
Actually, it's "Your Royal Highness."
"Your Majesty" is reserved for the king.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.833
Oh, thank you for the etiquette lesson.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.458
You are desperately in need of one.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.416
You know what?

05:16.958 --> 05:18.708
I am so sorry.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.708
I'm so sorry. Uh...

05:31.000 --> 05:32.333
I can fix this, I can fix this.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.416
That is 100-year-old whisky.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.833
Just-just give me your handkerchief.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.458
I-I got it.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.958
Got it.

05:44.958 --> 05:46.125
It'll be fine.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.083
No, no, no, no, no, no!

05:57.416 --> 05:58.416
Oh!

06:04.166 --> 06:05.708
Oh.

Takes the cake?

07:40.958 --> 07:42.750
Oh, you hear that, Zahra?
He's opening with a joke.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.291
Maybe he can host
the Correspondents' Dinner next year.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.500
- Oh, I'd be down.
- No.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.375
I sent you to London
with some pretty simple instructions:

07:49.375 --> 07:53.541
represent the family at the royal wedding
and don't cause an international incident.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.375
Henry shoved me.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.625
An urge I currently share with the prince.

07:58.625 --> 08:02.125
We have spent the last three years
negotiating a new trade deal

08:02.125 --> 08:03.416
with His Majesty's government.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.875
Thousands of hours, gallons of tea.

08:05.875 --> 08:09.583
Before this weekend, I had a higher
approval rating than the prime minister.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.291
Hell, I was outpolling the Spice Girls.

08:12.291 --> 08:16.375
And overnight,
you've managed to undo all that.

08:16.375 --> 08:20.125
Ma, you know by next week,
no one will be talking about this anymore.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.083
And really, no reasonable person is
gonna even pay attention to that article.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.083
The British people

08:25.083 --> 08:29.291
deserve better from our closest ally
than this juvenile stunt.

08:29.291 --> 08:32.541
And it certainly casts a pall
over our negotiations.

08:32.541 --> 08:36.708
I'm on the ballot again in 14 months,
and I need the farming exports

08:36.708 --> 08:41.000
and the manufacturing jobs that this deal
provides to take to Midwest voters.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.541
I'd argue that
you don't actually need the Midwest

08:42.541 --> 08:44.541
and there's a path to reelection
without the--

08:44.541 --> 08:46.625
You don't want to hear from me today.

08:46.625 --> 08:50.541
What I need from you,
sunshine of my heart,

08:50.541 --> 08:53.708
is some good old-fashioned damage control.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.958
Zahra will explain everything.

08:58.416 --> 08:59.833
I'm really sorry, Mom.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.750
I know you are, baby.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.916
That's why I need you to fix it.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.291
- Ah! Zahra!
- Asshole! (grunts) Idiot!

09:11.291 --> 09:12.916
- What are you-- Stop!

09:12.916 --> 09:15.166
You're flying back to London tonight.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.583
What? Why?

09:16.583 --> 09:18.500
To undo all the damage you've done.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.791
The White House and the palace
are gonna release a joint statement

09:21.791 --> 09:25.833
explaining that what happened at the
wedding was a complete misunderstanding...

09:25.833 --> 09:27.250
Yeah, which it was.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.041
...and despite rarely having time to see
one another, you and Prince Henry

09:30.041 --> 09:32.708
are in fact close personal friends
and have been

09:32.708 --> 09:34.541
- for the last several years.
- Zahra.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.666
This is a fact sheet on Prince Henry.
Memorize it.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.375
- He's not six-foot-two.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.375
- And does he get a fact sheet on me?
- Yes.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.958
And I can assure you that making it

09:43.958 --> 09:46.833
was one of the most depressing moments
of my career.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.541
And I once saw Mitch McConnell
eating a banana.

09:48.541 --> 09:52.458
Can I just point out that the royal family
are purely figurehead?

09:52.458 --> 09:54.083
They serve no elective role whatsoever.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.791
Oh, unlike you,
whose role is clearly spelled out

09:56.791 --> 09:58.958
in Article Nothing
of the U.S. Constitution!

09:58.958 --> 10:01.541
-  Zahra.
- And you are going there to work.

10:01.541 --> 10:03.250
No hookups, no partying.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.666
You can hate Prince Henry all you want,
but the minute you see a camera,

10:05.666 --> 10:07.416
you better act like
the sun shines out of his ass

10:07.416 --> 10:09.125
and you have a vitamin D deficiency.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.875
- You know...
- And there is no getting out of this.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.500
Oh, yeah? What if I set myself on fire?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.583
We'd ship the ashes to Heathrow.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.708
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Catherine, Duchess of Edinburgh,

10:25.708 --> 10:28.708
firstborn child of His Majesty,
King James III. Ha.

10:28.708 --> 10:30.958
Did you know she started
her own climate nonprofit?

10:30.958 --> 10:32.166
That's pretty cool.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.208
Do you want to switch jobs this weekend?

10:34.208 --> 10:37.083
No one in their right mind
would ever give you a gun.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.958
Henry's father, go.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.333
Arthur Fox,
beloved English stage and film actor.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.666
- Died of cancer three years ago.
- I remember that.

10:43.666 --> 10:46.125
- What's the name of Henry's dog?
- David.

10:46.125 --> 10:47.791
I mean, really, who names their dog David?

10:47.791 --> 10:49.458
You know I have a shih tzu named Jonathan.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.791
Yeah, I still maintain that's weird.

10:50.791 --> 10:53.041
That's my son you're talking about.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.250
- He is super cute.
- He is. You want to see some pictures?

- A hundred percent.

Didn't expect to be back

No one is more mystified than I.

11:28.416 --> 11:30.416
So what exactly is an equerry?

11:30.416 --> 11:32.333
Do you, uh, handle the horses or...?

I am His Royal Highness's

Well, don't I get to shower

I'm afraid we're on

Oh, my God,

12:14.375 --> 12:16.166
They're all yours, Jamie.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.125
Big smiles for the camera, please.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.625
My NDA is bigger than yours.
I want you to know that.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.708
You're wearing lifts.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.000
I know that, too, sweetheart.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.833
- Are we finished here?
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

12:37.125 --> 12:38.208
Dick.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.833
Hey, Shaan, you think
maybe I could get a little...?

12:48.833 --> 12:50.125
You're fine.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.291
Thank you.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.833
- Thank you, Shaan.
- Whenever you're ready.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.666
Quiet, everyone.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.916
Uh, can you two scooch in
a little closer together?

13:15.666 --> 13:17.750
Now, you've been mates since you met

13:17.750 --> 13:20.625
at the Melbourne Climate Conference
several years back.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.875
Is that correct?

13:22.958 --> 13:24.500
Yes, yes.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.875
Uh, we hit it off instantly.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.083
Yeah. -It's like we'd known
each other all our lives.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.166
Right?

13:31.500 --> 13:32.541
Yep.

13:32.541 --> 13:34.458
Wonderful.

13:34.458 --> 13:38.500
So, Alex, what do you think
of jolly old England?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.291
I-I really love it here.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.916
I've been a few times
since my mom was elected.

13:41.916 --> 13:45.833
I love the people, uh, the beer,

13:45.833 --> 13:47.625
the dogs that, uh, that wear the sweaters.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.958
-  Yeah.
- Well, actually we say "jumpers."

13:51.750 --> 13:56.125
Alex has very strong opinions,
and-and he shares them loudly.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.500
What three words would I use
to describe Henry?

13:59.583 --> 14:03.083
White, blond and British.

14:05.208 --> 14:09.458
One thing I most admire about Alex is
his willingness to admit when he's wrong.

14:11.875 --> 14:15.375
Wonderful, wonderful trait to have.

14:15.375 --> 14:20.625
You don't know this,
but Henry does the best freestyle raps.

14:20.625 --> 14:21.750
- Well...
- Come on.

14:21.750 --> 14:22.958
- Do a little for them.
- No.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.958
- That's not why...
- She wants to hear it.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.875
Remember that one that was just like...

14:27.875 --> 14:31.000
Don't you do an incredible
Barbra Streisand impression?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.708
- Voice of an angel this one, really.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.833
I love hanging out with this guy.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.333
Now, I have to ask this...

14:38.333 --> 14:40.250
...because it's all
anyone is talking about.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.208
How on earth
did you end up on the floor...

14:42.208 --> 14:43.500
...in Buckingham Palace...

14:43.500 --> 14:44.791
...covered in cake?

14:45.875 --> 14:48.916
Actually, it happens more often
than you'd think in the palace.

14:48.916 --> 14:53.708
In the reign of Queen Victoria,
they were having food fights all the time.

14:53.708 --> 14:56.500
Vicky.

14:58.166 --> 14:59.375
Classic.

15:00.708 --> 15:01.791
Hmm.

15:06.416 --> 15:07.958
- Do you know who this is?

15:09.375 --> 15:12.916
Well, his mum is
the president of the United States.

15:12.916 --> 15:15.416
And my mum is the Duchess of Edinburgh.

15:15.416 --> 15:19.625
Which means that his mum outranks my mum.

15:19.625 --> 15:20.833
What do we think of that?

15:23.875 --> 15:25.666
Do you visit this place a lot?

15:25.666 --> 15:27.166
Every couple months.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.458
Never with photographers, though.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.875
This way! Shots fired!

15:31.875 --> 15:33.166
Stay down.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.500
- Ow! Get your hands off me!

15:36.500 --> 15:38.625
- Knee.
- Ow!

15:40.375 --> 15:42.750
Okay. You are sitting on my leg.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.041
Are you serious right now?

15:52.666 --> 15:54.583
- Santal 33.
- Yeah?

15:54.583 --> 15:56.041
- Makes sense.
- What do you mean by that?

15:56.041 --> 15:58.208
- It means you got good taste, Alex.
- Thanks.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.625
And why do you dislike me?

16:07.166 --> 16:10.041
Climate Conference in Melbourne.
First night party.

16:10.041 --> 16:13.375
I went to introduce myself to you,
and you looked at me like I had head lice.

16:13.375 --> 16:16.625
Then you turned to your equerry and said,
"Get me out of here."

16:16.625 --> 16:18.958
I didn't realize you'd heard that.

16:18.958 --> 16:21.458
So you do admit
that's a douchey thing to say.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.666
I could have been nicer.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.833
All right, what else?

16:34.833 --> 16:37.333
It couldn't have just been the conference.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.625
Oh, my God, it is.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.833
It is, isn't it?

16:44.833 --> 16:47.625
- Don't minimize it.
- Uh, uh, how could I possibly?

16:47.625 --> 16:49.750
It's already as minimal as it gets.

16:49.750 --> 16:53.250
Are you, are you seriously telling me
that one meeting, years ago,

16:53.250 --> 16:56.541
in which, yes, I admittedly acted
ungenerously towards you,

16:56.541 --> 17:00.125
h-has occupied such a vast mental
and emotional space in your head?

17:00.125 --> 17:02.166
Okay, sure, when you put it like that.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.958
But it was my first foray
into the world as a public figure,

17:04.958 --> 17:08.791
and I was really scared,
and you could've helped me and you didn't.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.291
You're right.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.541
I'm sorry I was a prick to you. I...

17:34.916 --> 17:38.125
It's no excuse, but I was a prick
to everyone in those days.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.541
My father had died a few months before,

17:41.541 --> 17:45.375
and the palace insisted
on parading me around.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.125
For the record...

17:52.125 --> 17:54.083
I-I didn't say, "Get me out of here."

17:54.083 --> 17:58.166
I said, "I need to get out of here,"
which is a different thing entirely.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.166
Oh.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.458
Well, now I feel like I need to apologize.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.083
Threat neutralized.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.125
Some kid brought fireworks for his friend.

18:09.125 --> 18:11.500
When you say "neutralized..."

18:11.500 --> 18:13.166
It's good he's already in the hospital.

18:17.041 --> 18:18.541
Okay.

18:18.541 --> 18:20.541
And then they became friends.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.708
Well, we survived it.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.541
That means we never
have to see each other again.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.166
Wrong. You're expected
at my New Year's party.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.875
No, I hate New Year's.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.666
Wow. Most people would kill
to get an invite to my party.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.833
That's perfect.
Then kill me and I won't have to go.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.833
Some photos,
Your Royal Highness? Mr. Claremont-Diaz?

18:54.833 --> 18:57.750
I think we're supposed to shake hands now.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.583
I know, I know. Stand to your right.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.791
Alex?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.083
Okay, thank you very much.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.208
Well, I need to get out of here.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.958
See you in a few months, Your Majesty.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.666
Later, Shaan.

19:13.958 --> 19:17.916
<i>But I think it's telling
that, in it, no matter how silly</i>

19:17.916 --> 19:21.625
the so-called cake-gate controversy
may be, and it is very silly,

19:21.625 --> 19:23.333
you can already see the potential outlines

19:23.333 --> 19:26.500
of what President Claremont's campaign
could be about next year, right?

19:26.500 --> 19:30.333
And in so far as it concerns the
president's trade deal with Great Britain,

19:30.333 --> 19:34.541
well, the first son's
charm offensive this week

19:34.541 --> 19:36.291
has helped his mother's campaign.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.583
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, <i>mijo.</i>

19:38.583 --> 19:40.541
I watched your committee hearing
on the flight home.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.541
- Yeah, you and three other people.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.958
You should be tougher
on those agribusiness mofos.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.416
Well, maybe I can get you
to push them in a cake for me.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.291
What's your beef with him anyway?

19:49.291 --> 19:51.666
I mean, he seems like a nice enough guy.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.166
Oh, come on, Dad.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.291
He's elite and privileged
and lives in a palace.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.666
What? What's that?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.166
I'm just brushing that
working-class chip off your shoulder.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.333
Hey, you and mom taught me
to question authority.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.500
Mm.

20:05.500 --> 20:10.916
Meanwhile, you're now elite
and privileged and live in a palace.

20:10.916 --> 20:14.916
And your mom is the epitome of authority.

20:14.916 --> 20:17.500
It's funny how life works.

20:18.875 --> 20:23.041
Although, speaking of your mom's
authority, don't tell her I was smoking.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.916
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks. You, too.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.083
Alex.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.291
Hey, Miguel. What's up?

20:38.291 --> 20:40.958
- ACD, slumming it in Shaw.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.541
Got a minute?

20:42.541 --> 20:44.666
Yeah, I could hang.

20:44.666 --> 20:46.375
Nice damage control this weekend.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.833
I had no idea you and the prince
were such good friends.

20:48.833 --> 20:53.125
Yeah, well, neither did I.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.458
Hey, you mind if I put
my journalist hat on for a sec?

20:57.458 --> 20:59.333
Only if you actually have
one of those journalist hats

20:59.333 --> 21:00.625
like they do in the old movies.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.916
Promise I'll wear it for you sometime.

21:02.916 --> 21:05.166
- Is your mother's campaign nervous

21:05.166 --> 21:07.833
the Republicans are gonna
nominate Richards?

21:07.833 --> 21:10.791
The only Republican
who makes us nervous is Abraham Lincoln,

21:10.791 --> 21:11.958
and I doubt he's running.

21:11.958 --> 21:14.166
You see?
This is why I ask you these things:

21:14.166 --> 21:15.500
because you give me quotes like that.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.958
- You have to let me use it.
- Not a chance, Miguel.

21:16.958 --> 21:18.791
You are such a tease.

21:21.416 --> 21:24.416
How about
"sources close to the president"?

21:24.416 --> 21:25.833
I'm gonna pass.

21:28.625 --> 21:30.125
<i>Bueno, lo intenté.</i>

21:31.958 --> 21:33.625
We should hang out again sometime.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.125
Off the record, of course.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.333
It's been a while.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.750
Yeah, well...

21:40.750 --> 21:42.791
school's been crazy lately.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.875
Yeah, you're always running at full speed.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.208
That's what makes you so charming.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.666
That and your eyelashes.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.416
I should get going.

21:59.958 --> 22:02.833
<i>- Qué bueno verte, Miguel.
- Lo mismo, Alex.</i>

23:09.083 --> 23:10.541
What?

23:17.250 --> 23:18.500
Sorry.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.333
I hate the tie you're wearing in <i>Vogue.</i>

23:21.333 --> 23:24.125
It's so boring.
What do you have against color anyway?

23:24.125 --> 23:26.041
Gray is a color, thank you.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.500
<i>I just received a parcel
of your mum's old campaign T-shirts.</i>

23:32.500 --> 23:34.833
<i>Is this your idea of a prank? (chuckles)</i>

23:34.833 --> 23:38.250
<i>The next box is full of thongs.</i>

23:38.250 --> 23:40.125
<i>I first read Zadie Smith as a teenager.</i>

23:40.125 --> 23:43.791
<i>You absolutely have to read</i>
Another Country <i>by James Baldwin.</i>

23:43.791 --> 23:45.208
The Picture of Dorian Gray.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.000
<i>And</i> Love in the Time of Cholera.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.541
<i>Also</i> Madame Bovary.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.750
<i>I'm sending you a copy.</i>

23:49.750 --> 23:52.333
<i>That's the thing that people
don't understand about Byron's poetry.</i>

23:52.333 --> 23:56.541
H-He was single-handedly responsible
for every romance ever written

23:56.541 --> 23:58.208
in the last two centuries.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.125
And that's not even considering
his personal life.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.916
I'm blocking you
for the rest of the night.

24:01.916 --> 24:04.458
He had London under his spell.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.875
HENRY
Good God, man, what have you done?

24:14.875 --> 24:17.500
So, there's this American tradition

24:17.500 --> 24:19.958
where the president pardons a turkey
before Thanksgiving.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.083
I don't understand.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.375
Don't you have to commit a crime
to be pardoned?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.750
Don't look too closely at it.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.791
I found out that they keep the turkey
in a luxury hotel suite

24:28.791 --> 24:30.166
the night before the ceremony.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.500
I mean, can you think of anything
more wasteful?

24:32.500 --> 24:34.291
Oh, perhaps this conversation.

24:34.291 --> 24:38.041
Anyway, I convinced my mother's staff
to keep it at the White House,

24:38.041 --> 24:40.000
and they put the little asshole
in my room.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.916
Don't ask mummy for a pet
if you can't take care of it.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.083
Why are you awake?

24:44.083 --> 24:46.750
Because some bellend decided to call me
at 3:00 a.m. to talk turkey.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.000
What's a bellend?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.291
Look it up.

24:50.291 --> 24:53.958
I'm also a world-class insomniac.

24:53.958 --> 24:56.333
I'm in bed with my dog watching <i>Bake Off.</i>

24:56.333 --> 24:59.416
It never occurred to me
that the royal family watches television.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.541
Well, we all share the same password.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.041
You're more of a human than I thought.

25:04.041 --> 25:05.625
Wow, thank you, Alex.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.041
That is so flattering.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.458
No, I just mean you don't seem like
the kind of person

25:09.458 --> 25:10.875
that would name their dog David.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.208
Well, he's named after Bowie.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.791
- Wait, seriously?
- Hmm.

25:14.791 --> 25:17.291
That's way cooler.
Why not just call him Bowie, then?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.375
It's a bit on the nose, don't you think?

25:21.458 --> 25:23.125
Have I surprised you in any way?

25:24.875 --> 25:25.958
Nope.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.125
You are just as ghastly as I imagined.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.500
- I'm hanging up now.
- No, I'm hanging up on you.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.833
Fine.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.833
Have it your way.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.333
That's what the big red button is for.

25:49.958 --> 25:51.083
Good night.

26:11.541 --> 26:15.333
Has anyone on the campaign
actually read my Texas strategy memo?

26:15.333 --> 26:17.250
What Texas strategy memo?

26:17.250 --> 26:19.291
I think I have my answer.

26:19.291 --> 26:20.708
Alex, this isn't a really good time.
I have a ton of work.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.583
Can you just--
Yeah, just make yourself at home, kid.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.666
- Okay, here's the deal.

26:24.666 --> 26:28.000
I wrote a 14-page memo detailing
how we can win in Texas next year.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.791
I spent weeks working on it.

26:29.791 --> 26:32.291
I think it's a viable plan
that you should take seriously.

26:32.291 --> 26:36.416
I emailed it to senior campaign staff
three weeks ago, and I've heard nada.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.875
Did anyone ask you to write this memo?

26:39.875 --> 26:42.208
- No, I took the initiative.
- Yeah.

26:42.208 --> 26:43.791
If there's one thing
people on campaigns hate,

26:43.791 --> 26:46.458
it's when the candidate's family
takes initiative.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.041
Zahra, there are good ideas in here.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.166
I really want to help.

26:50.166 --> 26:52.250
You do help.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.750
You are genuinely useful.

26:54.750 --> 26:58.291
Yeah, for, like, photo ops and New Year's
parties and stupid shit like that.

26:58.291 --> 27:00.000
But I can be doing so much more.

27:01.416 --> 27:03.916
Will you please read my memo?

27:03.916 --> 27:05.250
Fine.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.958
- Thank you.
- Now get the hell out of my office.

27:07.958 --> 27:09.458
Oh, one more thing.

27:09.458 --> 27:12.666
Uh, has your new buddy, the prince,
confirmed for your New Year's party?

27:12.666 --> 27:15.375
Zahra, did you not just listen
to my entire soliloquy?

27:15.375 --> 27:17.916
Alex, I've got the prime minister
coming in town next month for a visit.

27:17.916 --> 27:20.041
You want to help your mother's campaign?

27:20.041 --> 27:22.416
Make sure Prince Henry
comes to your party.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.500
People like him more than they like you.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.416
Well, they wouldn't if they knew him.
Later!

28:25.541 --> 28:30.083

28:30.083 --> 28:34.500

28:45.500 --> 28:48.583

Wanted to get some air.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.208
Did I do something wrong?

32:14.875 --> 32:18.500
Do you ever wonder who you'd be
if you were...

32:18.500 --> 32:20.875
an anonymous person in the world?

32:24.708 --> 32:28.416
I was an anonymous, working-class kid
for most of my life.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.791
And then my mom became president.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.791
Who would you be?

32:45.958 --> 32:47.541
Be a writer.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.208
Live in Paris.

32:55.833 --> 32:57.833
- I'd certainly date more.

32:57.833 --> 33:01.333
Yeah, 'cause it's so hard
for a prince to get a date.

33:01.333 --> 33:07.416
People I date don't interest me, and
the people who interest me, I can't date.

33:07.416 --> 33:10.375
Oh, my God, Henry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.083
Christ, you're as thick as it gets.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.625
I'm sorry.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.375
RICHARDS
Under Ellen Claremont,

33:45.375 --> 33:51.125
we're now losing two manufacturing jobs
every single minute of every day.

33:51.125 --> 33:56.541
By the time this debate finishes,
another 200 Americans will be out of work.

33:56.541 --> 34:00.125
You know, I just wish
some of my colleagues in this race

34:00.125 --> 34:03.750
would go out on the road with me to see
what's happening in our Midwestern towns.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.125
Empty factories, hollowed-out storefronts,

34:07.125 --> 34:09.583
- communities in despair.

34:09.583 --> 34:12.125
I'm ready to lead from day one,

34:12.125 --> 34:15.458
and that's why I can deliver on my plan
and bring prosperity!

34:15.458 --> 34:17.875
Prosperity!

34:20.333 --> 34:22.000
Hey, Nora?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.166
Hey. What's up?

34:23.166 --> 34:25.291
Got a minute?

34:26.375 --> 34:28.291
Okay, what's going on?

34:28.291 --> 34:31.125
So...

34:31.125 --> 34:33.416
- funny thing happened on New Year's Eve.
- Mm.

34:33.416 --> 34:35.541
Henry kinda kissed me.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.333
I totally, privately called that.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.958
- Oh, shut up, Nora. You did not.
- Hey, it's my job

34:40.958 --> 34:43.791
to analyze data,
and he has never once checked me out,

34:43.791 --> 34:46.541
and I am what some men
would consider exquisite.

34:46.541 --> 34:48.416
So from where I'm sitting, Henry's...

34:48.416 --> 34:49.916
Kinda gay?

34:49.916 --> 34:52.833
More like the first 50 rows
of a Gaga concert kinda gay.

34:52.833 --> 34:55.500
But he's always dating a different girl.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.500
Oh, honey,
princes aren't allowed to be gay.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.666
You should know that.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.250
Did I forget your birthday?

35:05.250 --> 35:07.208
Not yet.

35:07.208 --> 35:09.708
Do you remember Henry's friend Percy?

35:12.500 --> 35:14.083
Are you into him?

35:14.083 --> 35:16.083
I'm not not into him.

35:16.083 --> 35:18.250
Right now I'm more into getting
female-identifying candidates

35:18.250 --> 35:22.291
elected to Congress,
but he does have good taste in florists.

35:22.291 --> 35:25.166
Anyway, okay, uh,
tell me more about this kiss.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.875
Did you like it?

35:29.333 --> 35:32.958
He grabbed my hair in a way
that made me understand

35:32.958 --> 35:35.666
the difference between rugby and football.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.666
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

35:38.666 --> 35:41.208
I mean, it wasn't unpleasant,

35:41.208 --> 35:43.583
just... surprising.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.541
I mean, you've been wanting him
to dick you down forever.

35:45.541 --> 35:47.833
What? Wrong!

35:47.833 --> 35:50.000
No, no, no, no, no.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.375
Okay.

35:51.375 --> 35:55.208
Allow me to, um,
lay out some observations for you.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.583
Extrapolate as you wish.

35:57.583 --> 36:00.916
First, you've been, like,
completely obsessed with Henry for years.

36:00.916 --> 36:02.833
- I've not been...
- Do not interrupt me.

36:02.833 --> 36:07.416
You've been long-distance text flirting
with him all day, every day, for months.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.458
- Uh...
- You spent the entire New Year's party

36:09.458 --> 36:12.875
straight-up ignoring
the who's who of hot young women

36:12.875 --> 36:15.625
- in order to talk to Henry.

36:15.625 --> 36:18.458
And, uh, he kissed you, and you liked it.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.458
So...

36:20.458 --> 36:23.416
objectively, what do you think that means?

36:25.416 --> 36:26.791
I don't know.

36:28.208 --> 36:29.750
Come on!

36:29.750 --> 36:32.375
I don't know! I don't know!

36:32.375 --> 36:35.750
Okay, look, I can wrap my head around
being low-level into guys,

36:35.750 --> 36:38.541
but what I'm really confused about
is being into Henry.

36:38.541 --> 36:41.208
- How many guys have you been with?

36:41.208 --> 36:42.791
Whoa.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.041
Uh...

36:54.333 --> 36:55.750
Two.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.708
Once in high school
and once with Miguel Ramos.

36:58.708 --> 37:01.166
The <i>Politico</i> reporter?!

37:01.166 --> 37:02.666
Shut up!

37:02.666 --> 37:04.875
Didn't see that coming.

37:04.875 --> 37:06.208
What was that story there?

37:06.208 --> 37:08.541
We once made out on the campaign,

37:08.541 --> 37:12.000
drunk, fully naked, in a hot tub.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.083
I get the feeling he wants me back in that
hot tub, but, you know, he's a journalist.

37:15.083 --> 37:19.000
Right. Yeah.
Closeted princes are much safer.

37:20.458 --> 37:23.000
Um, okay, well, do you two have
any appearances coming up?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
He's supposed to be my guest
to the prime minister's dinner next month.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.875
He can't ignore me all night.

37:29.291 --> 37:30.708
Can he?

37:30.708 --> 37:32.625
I guess you'll find out.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.916
Julia?

37:33.916 --> 37:35.416
Nora, come on.

37:35.416 --> 37:38.916
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States</i>

37:38.916 --> 37:41.583
and the prime minister
of the United Kingdom.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.750
Madam President.

37:56.208 --> 37:57.708
Alex.

37:57.708 --> 37:58.916
Perfect.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.416
- Madam President.

38:15.791 --> 38:16.916
Alex.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.958
- Nice tux. <i>Qué guapo.</i>
- Hey, Miguel.

38:19.958 --> 38:21.250
Thanks. You, too.

38:21.250 --> 38:24.541
I read your Texas campaign memo.

38:24.541 --> 38:27.458
How? That was super confidential.

38:27.458 --> 38:29.000
I'm a journalist, Alex.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.208
I quite literally have my sources.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.875
Anyway, I-I think
you've got some good ideas.

38:36.041 --> 38:37.333
Thanks, Miguel.

38:37.333 --> 38:39.458
Prince Henry, over here.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.416
The campaign putting
your memo into action?

38:41.416 --> 38:42.541
Because they should.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.166
Is this the year
the Democrats finally flip Texas?

38:54.958 --> 38:56.208
Earth to Alex.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.625
Yeah, we're, uh, gonna flip Texas.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.333
Good to see you, Miguel.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.666
- I need your help.
- Where's the threat?

39:06.666 --> 39:08.458
- Do we need to clear the room?
- What?

39:08.458 --> 39:10.958
No. I just need to talk to Henry.

39:12.583 --> 39:13.916
In private.

39:15.166 --> 39:16.875
Best I can do is the Red Room.

39:16.875 --> 39:20.000
You take him any further
and his security team will taser you.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.291
Look...

39:52.291 --> 39:54.833
I know I owe you an explanation.

39:54.833 --> 39:57.791
- My behavior was appalling.
- Shut up. Stop talking.

40:00.125 --> 40:02.708
Wait a minute.

40:12.583 --> 40:14.833
All right, fellas, time's up.
We got to get back to--

40:14.833 --> 40:16.708
Oh, God.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.833
So are you still...?

40:22.833 --> 40:24.625
Like Stonehenge.

40:24.625 --> 40:26.666
- Your Royal Hardness.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.083
Or Big Ben.

40:29.083 --> 40:31.875
Nelson's Column.

40:31.875 --> 40:34.000
There you are.
- Hi, Ma.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.208
Prime Minister, this is my son, Alex.

40:37.208 --> 40:39.875
It's good to see you
and His Royal Highness on better terms

40:39.875 --> 40:41.750
and not on the floor.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.208
Yes, Prime Minister.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.791
Henry and I are much happier
against walls. -

40:46.875 --> 40:48.291
Everything all right?

40:48.291 --> 40:51.333
Yes. Uh, very excited to be here.

40:51.333 --> 40:55.500
Well, hopefully we'll get through tonight
without any more scandals from these two.

40:55.500 --> 40:56.916
The night is young, Ma.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.083
Please, Prime Minister.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.250
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- Yes, tell me.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.750
You're gonna stay at least 500 feet
away from me for the rest of the night.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.125
- Sensible plan.
- I'm not done.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.583
- Of course you're not.
- Then at midnight,

41:12.583 --> 41:14.791
you're gonna come to my room
on the second floor of the residence

41:14.791 --> 41:18.125
where I'm going to do
some very bad things to you.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.083
You're late.

41:39.958 --> 41:42.625
To be clear,
this changes nothing between us.

41:42.625 --> 41:46.000
- I was about to say the same thing.
- No, you weren't. That's impossible.

41:56.791 --> 41:58.250
When did you start to...

41:58.250 --> 41:59.791
- Fancy you?
- Yeah.

41:59.791 --> 42:02.708
Melbourne Climate Conference.
First night party.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.791
Wow, you had a lot going on that night.

42:04.791 --> 42:06.208
Tell me about it.

42:06.208 --> 42:09.375
- I really thought you hated me.
- I hated how good you looked.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.083
What's that?

42:31.416 --> 42:33.375
A key to my family's house in Austin.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.583
I started wearing it when we moved here.

42:38.666 --> 42:40.000
Hmm.

42:41.291 --> 42:43.750
You know, I don't...

42:43.750 --> 42:46.458
think I've ever owned
a key in my entire life.

42:48.125 --> 42:51.125
No such thing as a locked door
when you're a prince, I suppose.

42:51.125 --> 42:54.250
Well, you'd be surprised.

42:55.625 --> 42:58.750
Just to put it out there...

42:58.750 --> 43:00.375
Yes?

43:06.666 --> 43:09.125
I guess you could say I'm...

43:13.625 --> 43:15.291
...bisexual.

43:16.875 --> 43:18.916
Yeah.

43:21.333 --> 43:22.375
Noted.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.666
Ah.

43:26.666 --> 43:28.958
Just to put it out there,

43:28.958 --> 43:32.625
I am...

43:32.625 --> 43:37.166
as gay as a maypole.

43:37.166 --> 43:40.083
- What?

43:40.083 --> 43:42.875
- I have no idea what a maypole is.
- Maypole. Right.

43:42.875 --> 43:45.166
Are they known
for their homosexual tendencies?

43:45.166 --> 43:46.708
Oh, oh, God, yes.

43:46.708 --> 43:47.958
- Notorious.
- Yeah.

43:47.958 --> 43:49.416
Notorious for it.

44:00.041 --> 44:03.166
I wouldn't mind doing this again.

44:05.958 --> 44:07.375
Me neither.

44:09.916 --> 44:13.041
We just have to keep it
very casual, of course.

44:14.250 --> 44:16.250
Oh. Obviously.

44:16.250 --> 44:18.125
The press and all.

44:18.125 --> 44:20.166
I just can't afford for you
to fall in love with me.

44:20.166 --> 44:21.875
-  Oh.
- Okay, wait a minute.

44:21.875 --> 44:25.208
- No, that's not what I meant when I...
- Get over yourself, Your Majesty.

44:25.208 --> 44:27.000
It's "Your Royal Highness."

44:27.000 --> 44:29.791
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you that.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.500
I should probably get going.

44:48.583 --> 44:49.666
- I guess I'll see you...
- You know, I was thinking...

44:49.666 --> 44:51.208
- No, you can-- After you.
- You should...

44:51.208 --> 44:53.416
Please, you first.

44:55.208 --> 44:58.916
There's this charity polo match
in Windsor next month

44:58.916 --> 45:01.541
that my mate Percy's foundation organizes.

45:01.541 --> 45:03.041
I, uh...

45:05.833 --> 45:08.541
I was wondering if
you might want to be my guest.

45:08.541 --> 45:10.708
Oh.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.125
Um...

45:13.125 --> 45:15.125
I don't know how to play polo.

45:17.500 --> 45:18.583
Damn.

45:20.916 --> 45:25.041
Well, I suppose that will be all right,
seeing as you won't be playing.

45:26.416 --> 45:27.833
I will.

45:27.833 --> 45:30.333
You'll be watching on the sidelines.

45:30.333 --> 45:32.000
Great.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.625
That's probably safer for everyone.

45:34.625 --> 45:36.416
Yeah, agreed.

47:21.916 --> 47:23.791
Are you hungry?

47:23.791 --> 47:25.666
Yeah, I could eat.

47:36.708 --> 47:39.458
There's something
I've been dying to ask you.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.041
Which other famous boys have I shagged?

47:41.041 --> 47:42.416
There's two things
I've been dying to ask you.

47:42.416 --> 47:44.958
All right, let's start with the first.

47:46.041 --> 47:47.458
Do you have a last name?

47:47.458 --> 47:50.916
Actually, I have several.

47:50.916 --> 47:52.916
The official family name
is Hanover-Stuart.

47:52.916 --> 47:56.041
My father's surname was Fox.

47:56.041 --> 48:00.333
So my full name is Henry George
Edward James Hanover-Stuart Fox.

48:01.458 --> 48:05.500
And I thought Alexander Gabriel
Claremont-Diaz was a mouthful.

48:07.083 --> 48:08.375
He is.

48:19.041 --> 48:21.166
Does anyone in your family know about you?

48:22.375 --> 48:24.833
My sister Bea's the only one I've told.

48:24.833 --> 48:26.625
My mum probably suspects.

48:26.625 --> 48:30.291
My brother Philip is completely oblivious.

48:30.291 --> 48:33.583
And what about His Majesty, the king?

48:35.875 --> 48:38.000
Grandpa's a cold, hard realist.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.375
He sat me down
on my 18th birthday and told me

48:40.375 --> 48:44.833
not to let any selfish desires I might be
harboring reflect poorly on the crown.

48:44.833 --> 48:46.916
That is some bullshit.

48:49.208 --> 48:51.000
It's my life.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.083
Doesn't mean you have to accept it.

48:57.333 --> 49:01.166
I was four years old when I realized

49:01.166 --> 49:05.500
that everyone in my country
knew my name, but...

49:05.500 --> 49:06.833
I would never know theirs.

49:09.916 --> 49:12.750
Prince Henry belongs to Britain.

49:14.541 --> 49:17.708
Henry Fox has to belong to himself
or else...

49:19.541 --> 49:21.041
...he'll vanish.

49:23.666 --> 49:25.458
Can't he ever belong to someone else?

49:29.083 --> 49:30.500
Only momentarily.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.625
Not here.

50:05.250 --> 50:08.041
I think we should make love tonight.

50:08.041 --> 50:09.541
Oh.

50:11.833 --> 50:14.250
I-I mean, yeah.

50:16.458 --> 50:18.750
I'm down.

50:20.125 --> 50:22.375
But, I mean, who says "make love" anymore?

50:22.375 --> 50:24.375
Are we gonna, like, listen
to Lana Del Rey when we do it?

50:24.375 --> 50:25.916
- All right, all right.

50:27.916 --> 50:30.583
It's just...

50:30.583 --> 50:34.333
Who's gonna do what?

50:34.333 --> 50:35.833
Because I'm...

50:37.375 --> 50:39.125
I've never...

50:42.791 --> 50:43.916
Oh, my God.

50:43.916 --> 50:47.416
I'm so not playing this cool right now.

50:47.416 --> 50:50.041
I went to
an English boarding school, dear.

50:50.041 --> 50:52.041
Trust me, you're in good hands.

51:16.625 --> 51:18.500
Now, careful. Oh.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.666
- The buttons are quite sturdy.
- Mm.

51:22.666 --> 51:24.625
Rigid.

52:43.208 --> 52:45.583
I can't believe how wrong I was about you.

52:46.666 --> 52:48.500
Most people are.

53:39.166 --> 53:42.625
Is there any part of you that...

53:42.625 --> 53:44.916
wishes you weren't
the son of the president?

53:46.125 --> 53:48.750
Or that your family wasn't in politics?

53:52.625 --> 53:54.583
I actually wish I could help more.

53:56.666 --> 53:58.833
It's gonna be a tough campaign.

54:00.208 --> 54:02.083
You really do love it, don't you?

54:03.791 --> 54:05.666
Yeah, I really do.

54:09.250 --> 54:11.625
To devote your life to helping others?

54:15.250 --> 54:18.833
To know that what you do has
a meaningful impact on people's lives?

54:22.250 --> 54:24.250
I know it's my life's work.

54:27.791 --> 54:30.916
Is there any part of you that...

54:30.916 --> 54:32.500
doubts?

54:43.666 --> 54:49.000
My father was 12 when my <i>abuela</i> brought
him and his sister over from Mexico.

54:53.750 --> 54:57.416
You may not understand this,
but in America,

54:57.416 --> 55:01.083
if you're an immigrant
with a "Z" in your last name,

55:01.083 --> 55:05.166
there's not a lot of people
in positions of power that look like you

55:05.166 --> 55:08.041
or sound like you.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.958
I've been given a chance
to be someone in the world

55:15.958 --> 55:18.583
that my father didn't see
when he was growing up.

55:23.666 --> 55:25.666
You can't know what that means.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.333
I'm learning.

55:51.666 --> 55:53.291
<i>Did you tell Miguel Ramos</i>

55:53.291 --> 55:55.625
that we had a plan to flip Texas?

55:55.625 --> 55:57.041
What? No!

55:57.041 --> 56:00.583
16 tweets today,
all linking to his new article.

56:01.666 --> 56:03.291
He really tweets too much.

56:03.291 --> 56:06.583
"Mr. Claremont-Diaz,
a student at Georgetown Law,

56:06.583 --> 56:10.958
is playing an active role
in the campaign's new Texas strategy."

56:10.958 --> 56:14.208
I was unaware
my campaign had a new Texas strategy.

56:14.208 --> 56:16.208
Can you please tell me what it is?

56:16.208 --> 56:18.500
If your campaign had read my memo,
you'd know.

56:18.500 --> 56:22.083
All I said to Miguel is that Texas
is competitive and we intend to win it.

56:22.083 --> 56:24.083
I didn't think
he'd write an article about it.

56:24.083 --> 56:26.291
Well, he has, so now
we have to explain to everyone

56:26.291 --> 56:29.125
that we don't in fact have
a new Texas strategy.

56:29.125 --> 56:32.958
You do have a Texas strategy.
You just won't implement it.

56:32.958 --> 56:35.125
Why aren't you registering
a million new voters?

56:35.125 --> 56:38.125
Why aren't you firing up the youth vote,
building a grassroots movement?

56:38.125 --> 56:40.166
Why aren't you fighting
for your home state, Ma?

56:40.166 --> 56:42.375
I am fighting for my administration

56:42.375 --> 56:47.125
and for the people who can't afford
to have Jeffrey Richards become president.

56:47.125 --> 56:52.916
And I will not be the first woman
to lose reelection to this office.

56:52.916 --> 56:54.083
What is that?

56:54.083 --> 56:56.500
Our latest internal polling.

56:56.500 --> 56:59.000
Richards is killing me in the Rust Belt.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.583
That's where we need to focus, not Texas.

57:02.583 --> 57:07.000
You're being idealistic
when I need you to be realistic.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.333
Is that why you got into politics?

57:09.333 --> 57:11.291
To be realistic?

57:11.291 --> 57:13.500
Do you think that's what
the people really need right now?

57:13.500 --> 57:17.125
I do not need a lecture from you
about idealism.

57:17.125 --> 57:20.125
I was 28 when I was elected
to the state legislature.

57:20.125 --> 57:23.500
I had 150,000 constituents.

57:23.500 --> 57:27.375
Now I have 330 million.

57:27.375 --> 57:32.458
They need me to be realistic
so they can be idealistic.

57:32.458 --> 57:34.083
If you don't understand that,

57:34.083 --> 57:37.833
then you have a lot to learn
about politics, kiddo.

57:40.916 --> 57:45.125
You are no longer allowed
to speak to the press.

57:45.125 --> 57:46.791
Do you understand me?

57:48.250 --> 57:50.958
Yes, Madam President.

57:56.791 --> 57:57.916
Twenty-seven.

57:59.416 --> 58:00.500
What?

58:00.500 --> 58:03.916
You were 27, not 28,
when you won your first election.

58:03.916 --> 58:07.083
Ask any of the women who work for you.

58:07.083 --> 58:09.125
They'll be able to tell you that.

58:21.125 --> 58:23.458
Madam President.
Do you need me for something?

58:26.666 --> 58:29.125
What's the deal with this campaign memo?

58:34.791 --> 58:36.833
Oh, I remember that.

58:39.750 --> 58:41.000
What's all that?

58:41.000 --> 58:44.166
My first Texas campaign.
Your grandmother saved everything.

58:44.166 --> 58:47.541
Every press clipping,
every button, every flyer.

58:49.875 --> 58:51.083
I read your memo.

58:52.458 --> 58:54.375
- Good work.

58:54.375 --> 58:56.250
We're sending you to Texas.

58:56.250 --> 58:57.583
Really?

58:57.583 --> 58:59.250
You'll have a shoestring budget.

58:59.250 --> 59:01.250
You'll eat fast food for every meal.

59:01.250 --> 59:05.125
You'll work 18-hour days,
and you'll love every minute of it.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.416
So what do you say?

59:07.583 --> 59:09.000
When do I start?

59:09.000 --> 59:11.125
<i>Dear Henry:</i>

59:11.125 --> 59:14.250
<i>Greetings from the Lone Star State.</i>

59:14.250 --> 59:16.875
<i>It's hard to put into words
how exciting it is to be back here</i>

59:16.875 --> 59:19.708
<i>working to get my mom reelected.</i>

59:19.708 --> 59:22.875
<i>The energy here is electric,
and I think we can make a real difference.</i>

59:22.875 --> 59:26.125
<i>The only thing that would make it
even better is if you were here.</i>

59:26.125 --> 59:30.083
<i>Dear Alex: I can't think of
a single way to start this email</i>

59:30.083 --> 59:32.375
<i>except to say, "You're incredible."</i>

59:32.375 --> 59:35.375
<i>But should I also tell you
that when we're apart,</i>

59:35.375 --> 59:37.666
<i>your body comes back to me in my dreams?</i>

59:37.666 --> 59:42.041
<i>I can feel your skin against mine,
and it makes every bone in my body ache.</i>

59:43.291 --> 59:45.666
<i>Henry, seriously.</i>

59:45.666 --> 59:48.291
<i>I'm out here giving my all for my mother.</i>

59:48.291 --> 59:50.375
<i>I can't have smut filling my inbox,</i>

59:50.375 --> 59:53.083
<i>corrupting my mind
and bulging my pants like this.</i>

59:53.083 --> 59:56.625
<i>Look, buddy, you know I am incorrigible,</i>

59:56.625 --> 59:58.583
<i>so don't "incorrige" me.</i>

59:58.583 --> 01:00:00.541
<i>I'll behave.</i>

01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:03.333
<i>By the way, we call them "trousers,"
not "pants," dear.</i>

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.500
<i>But in this case, both seem to apply.</i>

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.500
<i>Also, from all the photos you're posting,
it really makes me want to visit.</i>

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.083
<i>Yes! I was just thinking that
I want you to come and see it one day.</i>

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:15.500
<i>Ah, there's so much
that I want to show you.</i>

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.958
<i>I think you'd really like Austin
most especially.</i>

01:00:17.958 --> 01:00:21.791
<i>I want to see your mouth covered
in barbecue sauce,</i>

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:23.333
<i>and then I want to lick it off.</i>

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.625
<i>Wait, don't they have napkins in Texas?</i>

01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:30.166
<i>I wish I could,
but my duties keep me here.</i>

01:00:30.166 --> 01:00:31.291
<i>Dear Alex...</i>

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:34.500
<i>It's becoming increasingly difficult
attending mindless ribbon cuttings</i>

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.833
<i>while you're out there changing the world.</i>

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:39.583
<i>- I'll be damned, Alex, but I miss you.</i>
<i>Dear Henry: I miss you, too.</i>

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:41.875
<i>- Dear Henry...</i>
<i>Alex...</i>

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:45.041
<i>I'll admit this to you and no one else.</i>

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.750
<i>For all my big talk and certainty,</i>

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.416
<i>I'm secretly afraid
I'm going to let my mother down.</i>

01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:53.375
<i>Alex, I understand what you're saying,</i>

01:00:53.375 --> 01:00:56.791
<i>and I believe what you're describing
is called "impostor syndrome."</i>

01:00:56.791 --> 01:01:00.083
<i>But I know that you are not an impostor.</i>

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:03.500
- We just hit a million voters!

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.291
<i>I'm reminded of one of my favorite
quotes from</i> Sense and Sensibility.

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:10.041
<i>"It isn't what we say
or think that defines us</i>

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:11.666
<i>but what we do."</i>

01:01:11.666 --> 01:01:14.333
<i>And I think that
what you're doing is amazing.</i>

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.958
We're going live
to the Democratic National Convention

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.333
in Brooklyn, New York,

01:01:20.333 --> 01:01:22.500
where Alex Claremont-Diaz
is addressing the crowd.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.666
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

01:01:23.666 --> 01:01:26.750
<i>My mom has inspired me
every day of my life.</i>

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:31.125
She has passed down to me a faith in
America that always looks to the future,

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:32.916
not back at the past.

01:01:32.916 --> 01:01:36.375
Her vision for America
has you at the center.

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:40.083
- Your hopes, your values, your future.

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:42.791
CROWD
Four more years! Four more years!

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.791
<i>Bien hecho, cabrón.</i>

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.458
- Great speech.
- Hey, Miguel.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:51.291
- You looked really good up there.
- Thanks.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.875
You know, we're both staying
at this hotel tonight.

01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:57.291
Tell me something.

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.791
Do you honestly believe
that we're ever hooking up again?

01:01:59.791 --> 01:02:01.375
Well, I don't anymore.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.125
Is there a problem between us, Alex?

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.541
Yeah.

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:07.083
The problem is you sandbagging me
and my mother's campaign

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.833
on your little wannabe
<i>Washington Post</i> website,

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:11.375
- claiming we had a plan to flip Texas.
- Which you do and have enacted

01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.916
and confirmed as much
when we spoke about it on the record.

01:02:13.916 --> 01:02:17.416
Well, the only thing I'm confirming
tonight is that you're an asshole.

01:02:17.416 --> 01:02:18.625
Feel free to use that quote.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.458
<i>Buenas noches, cabrón.</i>

01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:22.750
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.708
Oh, just a bit of skullduggery.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.541
Amy helped plan it.

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.208
We need to get up to my room right now.

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:55.041
Have you ever cooked for yourself?

01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:57.875
- Once, unsuccessfully.
- Mm.

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.458
Have you ever been on Grindr?

01:03:03.791 --> 01:03:05.500
Mm. Do you vote?

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.250
Mm-mm. Not allowed.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.791
- What? That's insane.
- Yeah.

01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:10.541
Them's the rules.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.166
Mm. What's your favorite movie?

01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:16.666
Oh, <i>In the Mood for Love.</i>

01:03:16.666 --> 01:03:18.250
I never seen it.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.250
God, sometimes I forget
how uncultured you Americans are.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:25.666
It is only
the swooniest movie of all time.

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:28.333
-"Swooniest"? Is that even a word?
- Yes, of course it is.

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.666
Have you ever had your heart broken?

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:42.250
The day my dad died.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.500
Alex Claremont-Diaz, it's almost 7:00.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.375
You have interviews to do.
Let's get going.

01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:02.708
Wake up. Shit, shit, shit.

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.083
- What's going on?

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:05.333
Come on.

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:07.958
- Let's get your mother reelected.
- Oh, shit.

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:12.750
Is there someone in there?

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:14.958
Be right with you, Zahra!

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:17.166
That's it.

01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:20.500
I... am coming in.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.750
- Hey! Do you mind?
- Oh!

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:24.416
- Come on! Zahra!
- Put clothes on now.

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:26.500
Zahra!

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.208
- What are you doing?

01:04:29.208 --> 01:04:31.666
- Where is she?
- Zahra, no one is here.

01:04:31.666 --> 01:04:34.125
Oh, really?

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:37.500
Well, that "no one"
left her phone in here.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.041
Okay, so she left her phone in here.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.750
- Big deal. It's all chill, Zahra.
- Oh.

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.208
Where is she?

01:04:42.208 --> 01:04:44.041
- Hello, hello?
- What are you doing?

01:04:44.041 --> 01:04:46.791
- Little missy?
- Zahra, please. It's all chill.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.583
It's all chill?

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:50.875
You hook up with some rando

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:52.791
the night before
your mother's acceptance speech.

01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:55.458
You don't have her sign an NDA,
of that I'm certain,

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:58.041
and then you let her bring
her phone in here,

01:04:58.041 --> 01:05:00.458
transmitting God knows what
to God knows who.

01:05:00.458 --> 01:05:02.916
- Trust me, she's not gonna do any of that.
- Yeah, Alex, yeah. That is really chill.

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:06.666
Ow.

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:07.833
Shit.

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.000
Good morning.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.250
Zahra, breathe.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.333
Don't you tell me what to do.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:27.333
- Do you want to sit?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:29.500
Okay. Wh-Where do you want to go?

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:31.833
Here?

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:33.083
- Yeah.
- Oh, there? Okay.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.875
- Yeah. Fine, fine. I'm fine!
- Oh. Okay.

01:05:38.583 --> 01:05:40.458
How long has this been going on?

01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.916
- Since New Year's.
- Oh, God.

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:44.416
And who knows about this?

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:45.916
Literally no one but you.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:47.916
And the Secret Service.

01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:49.833
And Percy.
- Right, and Nora.

01:05:49.833 --> 01:05:51.416
Oh, and I told my sister.

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:53.500
- Aw, I didn't know that.
- Yeah, she was really happy for us.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.083
Oh, I can't wait to see her again.
She's really...

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:57.750
Okay. Shut up, okay? The both of you.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.958
I need to think.

01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:01.250
Please don't tell my mom.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.208
Seriously?

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:05.458
Alex, we are in a hotel
crawling with reporters,

01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.041
in a city filled with cameras,

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:09.458
on the precipice of
the biggest event of the campaign,

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:11.083
in a race so close
it could be arrested for assault,

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.958
and you're asking me
not to tell your mommy on you?

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:15.166
Well, I haven't told her yet.

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:19.333
Oh, gee, kid, I'm sorry to interrupt
your process of becoming,

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:21.625
but you're the one who decided
to put your dick

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.166
into the heir to the British throne.

01:06:23.166 --> 01:06:24.625
Well, technically, I'm the spare.

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:27.000
Not talking to you, sir.

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:31.291
Okay.

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:34.291
Would it make any difference
if I told you not to see him again?

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.416
No.

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:38.583
Every time I see you,
it takes another year off of my life.

01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:40.083
All right.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:46.916
I'm going downstairs, and...

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:50.541
you better be dressed
and in the lobby in five minutes

01:06:50.541 --> 01:06:52.208
so we can get your mother reelected.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:55.208
- I'll be there.
- And as for you, Little Lord Fuckleroy,

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.291
you get your ass back
to merry old England right now.

01:06:57.291 --> 01:06:59.250
I want you chewing on
a goddamn crumpet by sunset.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.750
And if anyone sees you leave this hotel,
I will Brexit your head from your body.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.250
- You got me?
- Loud and clear.

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:09.833
Your Royal Highness.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Unbelievable.
They don't pay me enough for this shit.

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:21.250
Yeah, come in.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.375
Hmm. Hey.

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:27.916
Do you have a few minutes?

01:07:27.916 --> 01:07:29.500
Sure, darling.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.833
What's up?

01:07:35.166 --> 01:07:37.375
You look very serious.

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:39.958
Yeah.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:46.500
I've been, um, figuring some things out
about myself lately,

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.625
and it's, um...

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:53.666
relevant to the campaign, in a way.

01:07:54.916 --> 01:07:56.333
Okay.

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:02.333
- I've met someone.

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:04.041
Is that all?

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:06.125
Honey, that's great.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:09.125
I mean, why would that be
relevant to the campaign?

01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.875
She's not a Republican, is she?

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.958
No.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.458
She's also a he.

01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:25.208
And "he" happens to be Henry.

01:08:28.458 --> 01:08:31.541
As in the prince of England?

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.500
Yeah.

01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:40.458
Oh, I'm...

01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:43.000
We're gonna need some pizza.

01:08:46.083 --> 01:08:50.333
So are you, are you gay?
Bi? Fluid? Pan? Queer?

01:08:50.333 --> 01:08:51.958
Cool it, Mom. I'm bi.

01:08:51.958 --> 01:08:53.500
Oh, all right.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:56.375
Well, you know, the "B" in "LGBTQ"
is not a silent letter.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:58.458
- Yes, thank you, Mom.
- Mm.

01:08:58.458 --> 01:09:02.291
I mean, if I'd had more warning, I could
have made you a PowerPoint presentation,

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:05.041
- but...

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:07.875
Can I give you some advice?

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:09.166
Yeah, of course.

01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:13.666
You need to figure out
if you feel forever about him

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:16.000
before you take this any further.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.083
A relationship like this
will define your life.

01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:26.041
I don't know if we're there yet, Mom.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I don't know if we ever will be.

01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:33.791
One more thing.

01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:36.791
Uh, we didn't go over this particular type
of partnering when we had the talk,

01:09:36.791 --> 01:09:39.166
which is on me for making assumptions.

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:40.583
Okay.

01:09:40.583 --> 01:09:42.166
I just want to make sure you know

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:44.791
you need to wear a condom
if you're having anal intercourse.

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:45.916
Oh, my God.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:49.208
And we can, we can talk about
getting you on Truvada.

01:09:49.208 --> 01:09:53.666
And-and if you're bottoming,
then you need the HPV vaccine.

01:09:53.666 --> 01:09:57.416
And I can have HHS
send over some brochures.

01:09:57.416 --> 01:09:58.958
You are ridiculous.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:10:00.625
I cannot believe
they give you the nuclear codes.

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:02.458
And you have to tell your father.

01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:05.083
- Ugh.
- Hmm?

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:06.458
I don't know.

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:09.750
This is uncharted territory for us.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:13.375
When you're a parent,
every day is uncharted territory.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:16.875
And when your child is
Alex Claremont-Diaz,

01:10:16.875 --> 01:10:18.625
you get used to the exceptional.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:22.500
I love you.

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:27.708
I love you, too.

01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:30.833
<i>Dear Henry:</i>

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:33.416
<i>Well, I just came out to my mom.</i>

01:10:33.416 --> 01:10:35.875
<i>I was never afraid of her rejection.</i>

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:38.708
<i>I was afraid that she would see me
differently than before.</i>

01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:41.875
<i>But now I realize
that's exactly the point.</i>

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:46.416
<i>Anyway, my parents bought a vacation house
after my mother's book was published.</i>

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:49.666
<i>I'm headed there to chill over
Labor Day weekend with my dad and Nora.</i>

01:10:49.666 --> 01:10:52.291
<i>My dad suggested that I invite you.</i>

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:55.083
<i>Do you want to come? Please say yes.</i>

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:58.000
<i>P.S., Nora says to bring Percy.</i>

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:02.583
-  Hey!

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:04.416
Watch out! Here comes British Invasion!

01:11:04.416 --> 01:11:06.541
- Oh, we found them hitchhiking in Austin.

01:11:06.541 --> 01:11:09.916
Goodness, this is beautiful. -OSCAR:
Hey, welcome to La Casa Blanca Oeste.

01:11:09.916 --> 01:11:11.916
Dad, what is this music?

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.833
- It's so not the vibe.

01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:16.375
- It's great to see you again, sir.
- What's with the "sir"?

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:18.083
Please, call me "Congressman."

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:19.583
Oh, well, in that case,
you can call me "Your Royal Highness."

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:21.750
Who's ready to party?

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.708
This is what we should be listening to.

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:25.833
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.583
- Yes!

01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:51.375
- Ready? Ready?

01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:02.166
Wait till he finds out about
the karaoke machine.

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:04.333
No, no, I am definitely not doing karaoke.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:56.083
Not as bad as you do.

01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:57.875
Coffee's fresh.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:01.791
Henry's still sleeping?

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:03.833
He did karaoke last night.

01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:05.375
Plus half a dozen tequila shots.

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:07.250
Oof.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.375
I got to be honest:
I thought because he was a prince

01:13:09.375 --> 01:13:12.250
that, uh, he'd be a little more
of a candy ass.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.541
Yeah, he's tougher than he looks.

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:20.708
So you like him?

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.708
What's not to like?

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.666
I wasn't sure if you needed to have,
like, a Catholic moment about it or...

01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:28.666
Please. Have a little more faith
in your old man.

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.416
You are, after all,
talking to the patron saint

01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:33.875
of gender-neutral bathrooms in Austin,
you little shit.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.833
You know, uh...

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:40.416
your mom and I were a stupid idea, too.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.250
We were just babies when we had you.

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:44.791
Nobody thought we'd make it.

01:13:44.791 --> 01:13:47.375
Look at us now.

01:13:47.375 --> 01:13:51.666
Sometimes you just got to jump,
hope you're not standing on a cliff.

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:10.000
- Shower time!
- No.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.041
God, you are such a cretin.

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:14.208
No, get off.

01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:27.916
- I've been thinking.
- I seriously doubt that.

01:14:27.916 --> 01:14:30.291
"I seriously doubt that."

01:14:30.291 --> 01:14:32.833
I've been thinking about

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:37.291
how my life is gonna be
a lot different after the election.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:39.500
Hmm. How so?

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:43.958
Well...

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:46.333
my mom will hopefully be in office again,

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:49.958
and we won't have to worry about
winning any more national elections.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:52.333
And I'll have a lot more freedom.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.041
Until it's my turn
to run for office, of course.

01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:56.125
Of course.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:59.625
And I thought

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:03.833
maybe next summer we could come back here

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.791
for, like, a couple weeks.

01:15:06.791 --> 01:15:09.333
We can be naked

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:12.625
and have sex anywhere on the property
we want. -

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.791
We can walk through Austin holding hands,

01:15:14.791 --> 01:15:17.625
and it won't even matter
if anyone sees us.

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:26.583
I can take you around
to all the places I grew up,

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:29.125
and you can get to understand
my life a little more.

01:15:32.833 --> 01:15:34.958
I've never felt this way about anyone.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:59.166
It's like there's a rope
attached to my chest

01:15:59.166 --> 01:16:01.208
and it keeps pulling me towards you.

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:09.125
And it feels so right.

01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:18.500
What I mean to say is, Henry...

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.916
- I...

Hi.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.666
It's so good to see you.

01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:54.375
<i>What happened in Texas?</i>

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:57.416
I ended things with Alex.

01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:59.250
Oh, Hen.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.791
I'm so sorry.

01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:05.708
Did grandpa find out?

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:09.583
Not this time,
but I felt myself getting too close,

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:11.625
and I didn't want to break his heart.

01:18:11.625 --> 01:18:13.500
What about your heart?

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.875
Have you thought about calling Mum?

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:20.500
Last I heard from Mum,
she was off saving elephants in Botswana.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.333
Perhaps I ought to grow some tusks.

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:25.000
God, she better not abdicate.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.666
Or find herself at the top of a staircase
with Philip around.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:31.291
It's all so silly, isn't it?

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:36.375
The idea of royalty in the 21st century,
it's-it's so... antiquated.

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:40.750
Sometimes...

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:45.833
I wonder if what we do has
any meaningful impact on people's lives.

01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:48.166
Well, cheer up.

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:49.958
At least you'll never be king.

01:18:56.625 --> 01:18:58.000
Do you love him?

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:01.583

Has Percy heard from him?

01:20:07.166 --> 01:20:11.791
Percy said that Henry sometimes
goes into his cocoon phases

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:15.250
and the only thing to do
is just wait it out.

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:17.458
I can't wait it out.

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:18.916
I'm going crazy here.

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:23.750
Well, you have air miles.

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.000
Go to London.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.750
Get your man.

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:33.291
What if he won't see me?

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.416
At least you'll have your answer.

01:20:49.625 --> 01:20:51.083
Yes?

01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:55.916
Sir, Mr. Claremont-Diaz is at the gate.

01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:57.625
He insists on seeing you.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.208
Can we please talk?

01:21:08.291 --> 01:21:11.333
I'm going to let you say what you need
to say, and then I'd like you to leave.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.208
What's going on, Henry?

01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:17.416
A week ago, we were happy, and then
you disappear without saying a word?

01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:19.166
I think you at least
owe me an explanation.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.041
I have done nothing but explain myself
to you this past year.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.041
I don't know what more you want me to say,

01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:27.791
and I don't appreciate you barging in here
in the middle of the night.

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:30.625
Well, I'm sorry I can't turn
my feelings off as easily as you.

01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:32.833
D-Do you honestly think
this is easy for me?

01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:36.541
What else am I supposed to think?

01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.583
You won't talk to me.

01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:42.375
All I know is I'm the one here
willing to fight for us.

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.583
Because it costs you nothing!

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:48.166
I've been losing my mind this week

01:21:48.166 --> 01:21:52.375
because the man I love has vanished
from my life without an explanation.

01:21:54.166 --> 01:21:56.250
I flew across an ocean.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:21:59.541
I...

01:21:59.541 --> 01:22:03.916
I stormed a fucking castle
to look you in the eye

01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:07.208
and tell you that I love you,
knowing that you wouldn't say it back.

01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:11.250
So, no, Henry, in fact,
this is costing me everything.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.666
And if this is over,
I at least deserve to know why.

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:15.250
Oh, for Christ's sake, Alex!

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:20.166
For once, I wish you could see me for
who I am and not who you want me to be.

01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:26.250
Sometimes I don't think
you know me at all.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.458
I'm not like you.

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:31.875
I can't afford to be reckless.

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:35.875
I wasn't raised by a loving,
supportive family like you were.

01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:41.666
I have centuries of history
bearing down on my shoulders.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:44.250
My life is the crown
and yours is politics,

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.916
and I will not trade
one prison for another.

01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:54.750
I can love you

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:58.000
and want you and...

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.291
and still not want that life.

01:23:01.291 --> 01:23:03.583
I'm allowed.

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.083
All right?

01:23:06.541 --> 01:23:09.583
And it doesn't make me a liar.

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:15.375
It makes me a man with some
infinitesimal shred of self-preservation,

01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:18.208
and you don't get to come in here
and call me a coward for it.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.958
I would never call you a coward.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:29.250
We can figure out a way to love each other
on our own terms, no one else's.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:32.083
That is simply not possible,
and you know it.

01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:39.750
Fine.

01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:41.250
I'll leave.

01:23:43.625 --> 01:23:46.916
And you can live in your tower and protect
your heart for the rest of your life,

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:49.083
and nothing will ever happen to you.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:54.375
But, Henry...

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:57.208
nothing will ever happen to you.

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:02.875
So if you want me to go,
you have to tell me to leave.

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:06.250
Please... don't make me.

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:13.250
It is the only way
you're getting rid of me.

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:18.708
Because I would never leave this room
if I didn't think there was any hope

01:24:18.708 --> 01:24:21.875
of holding on to the happiness
that I have found with you.

01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.541
And if you think otherwise,
then you don't know me.

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.125
So tell me to go, Henry,

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:33.125
and I promise I will walk out that door
and trouble you no longer.

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:37.125
Wait.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.500
There's something I want you to see.

01:25:55.625 --> 01:25:57.458
<i>When I was a boy...</i>

01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:02.875
<i>...my father used to bring me here.</i>

01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:08.083
<i>Early in the morning
before the museum opened.</i>

01:26:12.416 --> 01:26:14.791
<i>Now I like to come at night.</i>

01:26:19.791 --> 01:26:22.000
<i>In here,</i>

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.791
<i>at night,</i>

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:29.208
<i>no one else is around to gawk at you</i>

01:26:29.208 --> 01:26:31.125
<i>or try and take your picture.</i>

01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:43.000
<i>You can slip between the statues
like a shadow.</i>

01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:47.583
When I was younger,

01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:50.625
I would dream of

01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:53.083
taking somebody I loved here.

01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:58.291
And he'd love it as much as I did.

01:26:59.791 --> 01:27:05.166
And we'd dance right here
amidst all these statues.

01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:11.458
Just a daft pubescent fantasy.

01:30:13.416 --> 01:30:14.750
Go win an election.

01:31:09.791 --> 01:31:11.708
What's going on?

01:31:11.708 --> 01:31:13.416
Is it Grandpa?

01:31:16.083 --> 01:31:18.541
Your emails to Alex have been hacked.

01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:20.916
They were posted overnight to Reddit.

01:31:20.916 --> 01:31:24.125
The <i>Mirror</i> and <i>The Sun</i>
ran them this morning.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:28.375
And now security photos of the two of you
at the V have been popping up.

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:31.958
H-How many of our emails?

01:31:34.541 --> 01:31:35.875
All of them.

01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:39.875
I'm so sorry, Henry.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:42.125
I need to call him.

01:31:42.125 --> 01:31:45.250
I'm afraid you can't, sir.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:48.750
I've taken the liberty of confiscating
your phone as a precaution.

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:50.166
You've done what?

01:31:50.166 --> 01:31:52.416
They've taken my phone and laptop as well.

01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:56.541
No.

01:31:56.541 --> 01:31:59.083
- You can't do this.
- Orders from the palace, sir.

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:01.041
No, I give the orders in this palace!

01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:04.416
These orders are from
Buckingham Palace, sir.

01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:11.416
It is believed that this is the work of
certain rogue elements within the media.

01:32:15.333 --> 01:32:19.833
C-Can we at least get a message to him?

01:32:19.833 --> 01:32:23.000
Um, uh, t-to the White House?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.916
I've tried my contacts
within the White House with no luck.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:30.208
They may be speaking to Downing Street,
but they're not speaking to us.

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:37.208
The emails, which the <i>Mirror</i> is calling
"The Waterloo Letters,"

01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:42.000
detail the romance of
Prince Henry and Alex Claremont-Diaz,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.750
the son of
American President Ellen Claremont.

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:46.125
As details emerge about

01:32:46.125 --> 01:32:49.666
Alex Claremont-Diaz's
relationship with the prince,

01:32:49.666 --> 01:32:51.875
the White House is
trying to stay on message.

01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:55.583
This is obviously a critical time
for the president in her reelection bid.

01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:58.583
Polls have her in a dead heat
with Governor Richards.

01:32:58.583 --> 01:33:01.291
Now we have Miguel Ramos of <i>Politico,</i>

01:33:01.291 --> 01:33:03.666
who was the first American journalist
to break this story

01:33:03.666 --> 01:33:07.416
and who has written extensively about it
in the week since the leak.

01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:10.958
I have to ask you, Miguel,
why is this anyone's business?

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:13.875
After all, Alex Claremont-Diaz
is a private citizen.

01:33:13.875 --> 01:33:15.916
He isn't at all a private citizen.

01:33:15.916 --> 01:33:18.958
He's playing an active role
in his mother's campaign. -

01:33:18.958 --> 01:33:21.166
Well, don't public figures
have a right to privacy?

01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:25.583
They do, but these emails clearly show
a pattern of obfuscation

01:33:25.583 --> 01:33:28.666
around this relationship, and it's my job
to examine and contextualize them.

01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:30.208
I'm curious, Miguel.

01:33:30.208 --> 01:33:31.958
These emails were posted to Reddit

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:35.708
at 11:54 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
on Sunday night,

01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:40.458
and your first article was posted
at 2:30 a.m. Monday morning.

01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:42.583
- How did you have time

01:33:42.583 --> 01:33:46.083
to read nearly 72 emails,
write an article and publish it

01:33:46.083 --> 01:33:48.625
all within two and a half hours?

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:50.750
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:53.666
Are you really that quick
or did you perhaps have advance knowledge

01:33:53.666 --> 01:33:55.083
that this leak was going to happen?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.208
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:06.375
Henry and I have been together
since the beginning of this year.

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:10.791
As many of you have already read,

01:34:10.791 --> 01:34:12.750
we've struggled every day
with what this means

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:16.041
for our families,
our countries and our futures.

01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:20.166
<i>And while neither of us is naive
about what it means to be public figures,</i>

01:34:20.166 --> 01:34:25.500
<i>we never imagined our most private
and intimate thoughts, fears and truths</i>

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500
<i>would become fodder
for public examination.</i>

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:35.500
<i>What was taken from us this week was
our right to determine for ourselves</i>

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:39.000
<i>how and when
we should share our relationship</i>

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.625
<i>and queer identities with the world.</i>

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:45.625
The truth is, every queer person has
the right to come out on their own terms

01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:46.916
and on their own timeline.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:50.291
<i>They also have the right to choose
not to come out at all.</i>

01:34:50.291 --> 01:34:52.291
<i>The forced conformity of the closet</i>

01:34:52.291 --> 01:34:56.750
<i>cannot be answered with forced conformity
in coming out of it.</i>

01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:58.958
<i>This isn't about shame.</i>

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:01.291
<i>This is about privacy</i>

01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:05.166
<i>and the fundamental right
of self-determination,</i>

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.791
which are exactly the principles

01:35:06.791 --> 01:35:10.583
on which the struggle for queer liberation
has always been fought.

01:35:10.583 --> 01:35:14.916
But there is another truth
that's much simpler:

01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:18.791
<i>I fell in love with a person
who happens to be a man,</i>

01:35:18.791 --> 01:35:20.958
<i>and that man happens to be a prince.</i>

01:35:20.958 --> 01:35:24.750
<i>He has captured my heart
and made my life immeasurably better.</i>

01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:26.875
<i>I love His Royal Highness,</i>

01:35:26.875 --> 01:35:32.208
<i>Prince Henry George Edward James
Hanover-Stuart Fox.</i>

01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:35.583
I hope one day we'll have the opportunity

01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:40.500
to be public about our relationship
on our own terms.

01:35:42.041 --> 01:35:43.750
Thank you.

01:35:46.916 --> 01:35:49.583
Great job.

01:35:49.583 --> 01:35:51.541
I'm proud of you.

01:35:53.208 --> 01:35:55.875
Is it still possible
I've cost my mom the election?

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:58.375
Yes.

01:35:58.375 --> 01:36:02.500
But it's also possible
that you just won her the election.

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:04.541
We'll find out next week.

01:36:07.916 --> 01:36:10.791
I hope Henry was watching.

01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:12.875
I could feel him watching.

01:36:15.250 --> 01:36:17.875
- He does this thing when he's worried.

01:36:19.208 --> 01:36:21.750
Furrows his eyebrows.

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:24.625
It's the cutest thing.

01:36:24.625 --> 01:36:25.875
God, I miss him.

01:36:25.875 --> 01:36:27.750
Oh, my God.

01:36:29.666 --> 01:36:32.791
- I just have to do everything around here.

01:36:35.375 --> 01:36:37.916
Shaan Shrivistava, this is Zahra Bankston.

01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:40.625
Look, I know we said we'd only
use these phones in an emergency.

01:36:40.625 --> 01:36:42.916
Well,
welcome to that emergency.

01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.541
I've got the first son in my office,

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:46.291
mooing over the prince
like a cow in labor,

01:36:46.291 --> 01:36:48.291
and I'm not gonna get any work done

01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:52.208
until you put these two lovesick
homosexuals on the phone with one another.

01:36:52.208 --> 01:36:56.208
I don't care what any of those
wrinkled white men at Buckingham Palace

01:36:56.208 --> 01:36:57.458
have to say about it.

01:36:57.458 --> 01:37:01.833
I want you to march your skinny,
perfect ass over to the prince,

01:37:01.833 --> 01:37:05.083
hand him your phone,
or so help me God, you will never

01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:06.250
see me naked again.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:07.791
Wait, what?

01:37:07.791 --> 01:37:09.625
I thought you might see it my way.
Yes, we'll hold.

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:14.333
You might be lousy at keeping secrets,
kiddo, but I'm not.

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:17.083
- Zahra, I could kiss you!
- Touch me and die.

01:37:29.125 --> 01:37:30.500
Hello?

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.083
ALEX
Baby.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.083
Alex?

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:38.750
Oh, my God. A-Are you all right?

01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:41.291
I'm hanging in there.

01:37:41.291 --> 01:37:43.666
Are you okay?

01:37:43.666 --> 01:37:45.375
No.

01:37:45.375 --> 01:37:47.000
No, I'm not okay.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.583
You know what?
I'm coming to London tonight.

01:37:49.583 --> 01:37:52.708
<i>Just hold on until I get there.</i>

01:37:52.708 --> 01:37:54.333
<i>We'll figure this out.</i>

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:56.458
<i>Hurry.</i>

01:37:56.458 --> 01:37:57.833
<i>Please.</i>

01:37:57.833 --> 01:37:59.916
<i>I'll break the sound barrier for you.</i>

01:38:32.458 --> 01:38:34.000
- Okay, move over.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:53.958
Have you heard from your grandfather yet?

01:38:53.958 --> 01:38:56.125
Not a word.

01:38:56.125 --> 01:38:59.041
Part of me wonders
if their entire strategy

01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:01.166
is to deny I ever existed.

01:39:01.166 --> 01:39:03.416
Can't keep you locked away forever.

01:39:03.416 --> 01:39:05.833
We really need to get you
a book on English history.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:16.541
I feel so lost right now.

01:39:16.541 --> 01:39:20.833
They used to call me
the Prince of England's Hearts, and now...

01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:22.541
it feels like everyone hates me.

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:24.125
Hey, they still love you.

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:26.166
They loved the idea of me.

01:39:27.708 --> 01:39:31.083
And now they are faced with the reality.

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:43.125
Your speech was beautiful.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.125
It made me very proud
to be your boyfriend.

01:39:47.125 --> 01:39:49.041
I'm always proud to be your boyfriend.

01:39:49.041 --> 01:39:50.875
Oh, sorry, I'm white and upper-class,

01:39:50.875 --> 01:39:53.750
- so my affection comes with strings.

01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:56.625
Oh, speaking of boyfriends on strings,

01:39:56.625 --> 01:39:59.416
- you'll never guess who Shaan is dating.

01:39:59.416 --> 01:40:01.125
Excuse me, sir.

01:40:01.125 --> 01:40:04.333
The king wishes to see you.

01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:05.625
Both of you.

01:40:22.833 --> 01:40:25.500
You know, it's not too late to
get out of here and fly to the Maldives.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.541
Tempting.

01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:31.000
But I think it's time
I stood up for myself.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.208
Might as well start at the top.

01:40:33.208 --> 01:40:36.250
The less you say,
the better it'll be for you.

01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:40.125
I do not need your advice, Philip.

01:40:40.125 --> 01:40:43.875
Yes, well, you continue to make a mockery
of yourself, and in return...

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:39.250
During the Second World War,

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:41.958
our intelligence services initiated

01:41:41.958 --> 01:41:47.583
a clandestine disinformation campaign
against our enemies.

01:41:47.583 --> 01:41:52.416
While we employed it
as a wartime necessity,

01:41:52.416 --> 01:41:56.166
there are a number
of unscrupulous governments

01:41:56.166 --> 01:41:59.666
who routinely concoct
wholesale fabrications

01:41:59.666 --> 01:42:03.458
about prominent people

01:42:03.458 --> 01:42:06.833
in order to further
their own national interests.

01:42:06.833 --> 01:42:10.291
I wonder, Henry.

01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:16.458
Do you suppose that might explain
these unseemly reports?

01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:19.250
It's all true, Grandpa.

01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:25.625
Nevertheless, I have directed
palace communications

01:42:25.625 --> 01:42:30.125
to issue a firm denial
of these accusations.

01:42:30.125 --> 01:42:32.833
They are not accusations.

01:42:32.833 --> 01:42:34.208
They are the truth.

01:42:34.208 --> 01:42:38.125
It's a truth from which
I am determined to protect you.

01:42:38.125 --> 01:42:40.250
I don't want your protection.

01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:41.541
I want your support.

01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:46.750
It is not yours to decide
which of the two you will get.

01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:51.333
I'm as much a part of this family as
anyone here, and I deserve to be happy.

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:56.125
Oh, Henry, no one is suggesting
that you don't deserve to be happy. I'm...

01:42:56.125 --> 01:42:57.875
But to throw away your future

01:42:57.875 --> 01:43:00.333
because of one mad infatuation...

01:43:07.708 --> 01:43:09.500
Have you read our emails, Philip?

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.375
God, no.

01:43:11.375 --> 01:43:13.750
Well, if you had, you would realize
that this is more than just

01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:15.583
a mad infatuation.

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:21.500
Alex and I love each other.

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.041
Deeply.

01:43:25.583 --> 01:43:28.916
And we are committed
to each other, deeply.

01:43:31.916 --> 01:43:34.791
I have read your emails, Henry.

01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.750
All of them.

01:43:39.916 --> 01:43:44.000
They leave no doubt
that your love is genuine.

01:43:45.625 --> 01:43:47.875
Occasionally vulgar but genuine.

01:43:47.875 --> 01:43:51.125
However, your primary responsibility

01:43:51.125 --> 01:43:54.458
is not to your heart but to your country.

01:43:56.208 --> 01:44:02.166
And anything other than maintaining
the traditional royal image is...

01:44:02.166 --> 01:44:04.166
out of the question.

01:44:04.166 --> 01:44:05.500
Why is it out of the question?

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.625
Mr. Claremont-Diaz,
let me disabuse you of the idea

01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:14.250
that your contribution to
this conversation is in any way welcome.

01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:17.833
You are party to this problem,
not to its solution.

01:44:21.333 --> 01:44:23.083
I'll ask it, then.

01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:29.750
Why must we maintain
a traditional royal image?

01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:31.416
Bec-- because, bec--

01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:36.791
Because the nation
simply will not accept a prince who is...

01:44:38.333 --> 01:44:39.750
...homosexual.

01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:45.875
Yes, Tommy, what is it?

01:44:45.875 --> 01:44:48.791
There's a rather large crowd
gathering outside.

01:44:48.791 --> 01:44:50.750
Well, how many people?

01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:52.625
Hard to say, sir. Several thousand.

01:44:52.625 --> 01:44:54.916
Right.
That's settled, then.

01:44:54.916 --> 01:44:56.750
What is it that we've settled?

01:44:57.916 --> 01:45:01.625
You're all to go home immediately,
uh, and await further instructions.

01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:03.541
What's going on outside?

01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:07.500
Henry, Bea, uh, there's a car waiting
to take you to KP.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.375
Oh, my God, Henry, look at this.

01:45:09.375 --> 01:45:11.625
Henry, Bea.

01:45:11.625 --> 01:45:16.333
Kensington Palace immediately,
and take the American with you.

01:45:16.333 --> 01:45:20.916
Apparently, there are crowds forming
in Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham,

01:45:20.916 --> 01:45:25.625
Cardiff, Edinburgh and Liverpool.

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.208
I will no longer be
the prince of shame and of secrets.

01:45:41.125 --> 01:45:45.541
Starting today,
the world will know me for who I am

01:45:45.541 --> 01:45:47.791
and not who you want me to be.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.416
You can't go out there.

01:45:54.416 --> 01:45:56.125
Grandpa, tell them
that they can't go out there.

01:45:56.125 --> 01:45:58.916
Henry, my boy.

01:45:59.916 --> 01:46:02.750
Are you sure this is what you want?

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:07.041
There is no turning back
if you go out there now.

01:46:07.041 --> 01:46:09.166
I certainly hope not.

01:46:11.916 --> 01:46:13.125
I love you.

01:46:13.125 --> 01:46:14.791
I love you more.

01:46:16.458 --> 01:46:18.083
I think that's up for debate.

01:46:45.375 --> 01:46:47.416
<i>Well, it has been a long election night.</i>

01:46:47.416 --> 01:46:51.041
The entire race now hangs on Texas.

01:46:51.041 --> 01:46:53.333
It's possible we are just minutes away

01:46:53.333 --> 01:46:57.416
from knowing who the next president
of the United States will be.

01:46:57.416 --> 01:47:00.875
With 265 electoral votes,

01:47:00.875 --> 01:47:04.833
Governor Richards has swept
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Minnesota...

01:47:04.833 --> 01:47:06.958
Let's find my dad. -...Wisconsin
and his home state of Michigan.

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:08.750
- Breathe, Alex.
- I'll breathe when we win.

01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:10.791
President Claremont is behind.
She's currently...

01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:12.625
Crikey, that's a lot of red.

01:47:12.625 --> 01:47:15.250
Yes, it is.

01:47:15.250 --> 01:47:17.500
It's all gonna come down to Texas.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.250
Remind me how this works again.

01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:20.750
We're the blue team, right?

01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:23.250
What do they teach
at that fancy private school?

01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:25.291
You just say the word, I'll get you
enrolled at UT Austin. -

01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:29.041
But that means all eyes now turn
to Texas, the president's home state.

01:47:29.041 --> 01:47:34.375
Texas of course has 40 electoral votes,
which means very bluntly and simply--

01:47:34.375 --> 01:47:36.166
it's easy to do the math here--

01:47:36.166 --> 01:47:38.833
whoever wins Texas
is gonna win the White House.

01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:41.583
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, hon.

01:47:41.583 --> 01:47:43.541
I-I wanted to say something like, uh,

01:47:43.541 --> 01:47:45.916
"This-this campaign was
never about just me.

01:47:45.916 --> 01:47:48.541
It was about the country
we hope to leave to our children."

01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:52.500
You may remember that it was her son,
Alex Claremont-Diaz,

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:57.583
who was the driving force
in turning her campaign's focus to Texas.

01:47:57.583 --> 01:48:00.541
And some people said that was to the
detriment... -Can you take a walk with me?

01:48:00.541 --> 01:48:03.833
...of the campaign's ability to carry
the so-called Rust Belt states tonight.

01:48:03.833 --> 01:48:07.500
It was a bold gamble to focus on Texas.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:10.458
- We're gonna see tonight if it paid off.
What's going on?

01:48:18.083 --> 01:48:20.875
I think my mom's working on
her concession speech.

01:48:23.958 --> 01:48:27.625
You fought hard, and it isn't over yet.

01:48:28.958 --> 01:48:31.083
You still haven't noticed my tie.

01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:35.875
Yellow roses.

01:48:35.875 --> 01:48:37.833
I read it was a thing in Texas.

01:48:37.833 --> 01:48:41.125
I thought it might bring you some luck.

01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:45.041
Oh, my God, I'm so grateful you're here.

01:48:52.208 --> 01:48:54.875
NBC News now projects

01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:59.625
that Ellen Claremont has carried Texas
and its 40 electoral votes.

01:48:59.625 --> 01:49:02.750
And that means NBC News can now project

01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:06.125
that President Ellen Claremont
has been reelected

01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:09.000
- as president of the United States.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.166
And looking at this map,

01:49:10.166 --> 01:49:12.458
it really isn't anything
that we have seen in a generation.

01:49:12.458 --> 01:49:16.083
We've got the Republican candidate
sweeping Midwest states like

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:17.541
Ohio, Pennsylvania...

01:49:19.416 --> 01:49:21.083
Thank you.

01:49:21.083 --> 01:49:24.791
<i>There are people who will tell you
that elections don't matter.</i>

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:27.625
<i>But try telling that
to the auto worker in Michigan</i>

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:31.750
<i>who worries whether or not
their plant will be shut down.</i>

01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:35.125
Tell that to the transgender
high school student in Mississippi,

01:49:35.125 --> 01:49:38.250
voting for the very first time.

01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:42.791
Elections do matter
because they give you a voice,

01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:45.250
and your voice is blended tonight
with the voices

01:49:45.250 --> 01:49:49.541
of millions of Americans just like you:

01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:55.333
openhearted, fearless
and alive to a bolder,

01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:57.791
<i>brighter, braver future.</i>

01:49:59.208 --> 01:50:01.125
What do we do now?

01:50:03.916 --> 01:50:05.833
Do you still have my key on you?

01:50:41.958 --> 01:50:43.416
We won.

01:50:44.916 --> 01:50:46.333
We won.

01:50:47.375 --> 01:50:48.958
After you.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.500
Wow, you really are
working-class, aren't you?

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:55.375
<i>Oh, shut up, Your Majesty.</i>

01:50:55.375 --> 01:50:56.625
<i>Do you want me to give you
a tour of the house?</i>

01:50:56.625 --> 01:50:57.916
<i>Yes, lead the way, darling.</i>

01:50:57.916 --> 01:51:00.666
<i>All right, so I took
my first steps right over there.</i>
