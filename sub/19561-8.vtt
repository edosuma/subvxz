00:00.008 --> 00:02.045
Previously on "Blacklist: Redemption"...

00:02.071 --> 00:04.859
Remember, Whitehall... she has
to tell you about Whitehall.

00:06.041 --> 00:08.805
Your accomplice... I
need to know his name.

00:08.830 --> 00:10.476
He's your son.

00:10.501 --> 00:12.000
I don't know anything about Whitehall.

00:12.025 --> 00:14.118
If you tell me, nothing
will happen to you.

00:14.717 --> 00:15.781
Who are you?

00:15.806 --> 00:17.484
I am Richard Whitehall.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.859
Whitehall has cracked quantum computing.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.250
A computer with this kind of speed

00:21.275 --> 00:23.092
would mean the end of
privacy as we know it.

00:23.093 --> 00:25.393
If Scottie moves from a
prototype to a working model,

00:25.395 --> 00:26.862
the woman would be unstoppable.

00:26.864 --> 00:29.397
As of today, I will do
everything in my power

00:29.399 --> 00:32.744
to take back control of
the company that I created.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.569
I know you're watching, honey,

00:34.571 --> 00:36.480
and I'm coming for you.

00:40.652 --> 00:43.315
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

00:44.706 --> 00:46.635
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

00:54.526 --> 00:56.136
Yeah.

00:56.161 --> 00:58.542
- All right. Just keep walking.
- I got it.

Hey! Hey, hey!

01:10.535 --> 01:12.707
You-you can't go in there!

01:24.888 --> 01:25.980
_

01:26.035 --> 01:28.590
Quantum computing is
like a skeleton key.

01:28.592 --> 01:33.027
The original mainframe computers
were the size of this room.

01:33.263 --> 01:36.998
You know a computer that's
10,000 times more powerful?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.472
This.

01:38.497 --> 01:40.936
That's the difference between
what's being used today

01:40.938 --> 01:42.172
and what anyone who gets their hands

01:42.197 --> 01:44.253
on Whitehall's device
will be using tomorrow.

01:44.281 --> 01:47.049
Today, cellphones,
laptops are vulnerable.

01:47.051 --> 01:49.918
Tomorrow, it'll be
banking, classified systems,

01:49.920 --> 01:51.894
troop movements, nuclear codes.

01:51.919 --> 01:54.707
Scottie's holding
Whitehall inside Halcyon.

01:54.732 --> 01:56.191
We can't just walk him out.

01:56.193 --> 01:58.646
No. We have to break him out.

01:58.671 --> 02:01.444
Of Halcyon? Any chance
you got a plan "B"?

02:01.469 --> 02:03.165
My plan "B" is already under way.

02:03.167 --> 02:05.200
The reason I went public
is to force the board

02:05.202 --> 02:07.135
to call a meeting to
decide who to believe,

02:07.137 --> 02:08.402
Scottie or me.

02:08.405 --> 02:10.072
The board already sided with her.

02:10.074 --> 02:11.807
I'm not going in to lobby for votes.

02:11.809 --> 02:14.242
I'm going in through the
front to enable you to launch

02:14.244 --> 02:16.044
a tactical assault through the back.

02:16.046 --> 02:18.464
- How are we gonna do that?
- You leave that to me.

02:18.466 --> 02:20.559
All you have to worry
about is assembling a team

02:20.584 --> 02:23.019
that'll stay off of Halcyon's radar.

02:23.706 --> 02:27.441
High risk, low probability of success.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.310
Got any takers?

02:30.426 --> 02:32.152
Yeah, I think I do.

02:34.030 --> 02:36.731
We talked about this. It was a mistake.

02:36.733 --> 02:38.174
I'm sorry.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.469
We didn't talk about it.

02:40.471 --> 02:42.494
I told you I knew about you and Kat,

02:42.519 --> 02:43.772
that you were sleeping
with my assistant.

02:43.774 --> 02:44.906
You apologized.

02:44.908 --> 02:47.103
That's acknowledgment, not talk.

02:47.128 --> 02:48.787
Do you want to talk about it?

02:48.812 --> 02:50.445
No, 'cause there's
nothing to talk about.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.013
'Cause if we did talk about it,

02:52.015 --> 02:53.882
I'd probably end up taking that ice pick

02:53.884 --> 02:55.602
and stabbing you with it.

03:03.412 --> 03:04.866
The board meeting...

03:04.891 --> 03:06.724
are you worried?

03:06.897 --> 03:10.155
Of course. Howard plays dirty.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.819
But I have a few tricks to play.

03:14.097 --> 03:16.371
- What's this?
- Insurance.

03:16.373 --> 03:18.240
I need your vote in the board meeting.

03:18.242 --> 03:20.683
- Where did you get this?
- Doesn't matter.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.144
Your soon-to-be ex is asking

03:22.146 --> 03:23.745
for full custody of Isaac and Hannah.

03:23.747 --> 03:25.004
She's not getting it,

03:25.029 --> 03:27.824
once a judge sees her snorting
her child-support payments.

03:33.222 --> 03:34.956
Of course I'm with you.

03:34.958 --> 03:36.057
Good.

03:36.059 --> 03:37.459
Can't afford to have Howard upend

03:37.461 --> 03:39.340
everything we've been working on.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.393
Looking for a refill?

03:44.418 --> 03:45.600
Nah, I'm trying to kick it.

03:45.602 --> 03:47.785
I'm here to sell you on something.

03:49.672 --> 03:52.340
We got a business proposal for you.

03:56.345 --> 03:58.048
Hands up.

03:58.073 --> 03:59.337
Now.

04:00.736 --> 04:02.370
What's in there?

04:02.956 --> 04:05.470
We need your help. We're willing to pay.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.422
This is the first installment.

04:07.424 --> 04:08.957
We don't need your money.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.226
Well, that's good,
because I didn't bring any.

04:20.035 --> 04:21.341
Mm.

04:21.366 --> 04:22.732
Taaffeite.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.252
A million times scarcer than diamonds.

04:25.277 --> 04:27.442
Retail price, $4,000 a carat.

04:27.444 --> 04:30.011
You're looking at 1,000 carats.

04:30.013 --> 04:31.379
You do the math.

04:34.121 --> 04:35.611
You trust her?

04:35.636 --> 04:37.331
She cool.

04:40.464 --> 04:42.697
Kind of help you looking for?

04:42.722 --> 04:44.872
The kind that could get you killed.

04:58.841 --> 04:59.908
So?

04:59.910 --> 05:03.291
So, enhanced interrogation works.

05:03.316 --> 05:05.257
And since you don't want me
using it on señor Whitehall,

05:05.282 --> 05:06.581
the results are mixed.

05:06.583 --> 05:09.818
Maybe he's working
with Howard, maybe not.

05:09.820 --> 05:12.136
I'll talk to him. Howard's almost here.

05:12.161 --> 05:14.089
Escort him in. Watch him.

05:14.091 --> 05:15.357
He's here for Whitehall,

05:15.359 --> 05:17.392
which means he's got
a plan to get him out.

05:17.394 --> 05:21.563
Curing certain cancers,
making more effective drugs,

05:21.565 --> 05:25.233
discovering distant
planets, driver-less cars.

05:25.235 --> 05:28.336
That is the promise of my inventions.

05:28.338 --> 05:30.873
Healthier, smarter, safer.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.909
There are so many rewards.

05:34.054 --> 05:37.445
But all you see is the evil this can do.

05:37.447 --> 05:39.281
Why is that?

05:39.851 --> 05:42.050
Because someone has
to live in the shadows

05:42.052 --> 05:44.336
so others can live in the light.

05:50.026 --> 05:51.526
I'll take him from here.

05:51.528 --> 05:54.431
Scottie asked me to
escort you to the board.

05:55.866 --> 05:57.299
Phyllis.

05:57.301 --> 05:59.601
- It's wonderful to see you.
- You, too, sir.

05:59.603 --> 06:00.769
Jesse.

06:00.771 --> 06:02.789
- How are the twins?
- Doing great.

06:02.814 --> 06:03.999
Bob. It's good to be back to see you.

06:04.024 --> 06:05.578
- Do any of you really think...
- Denise, hi.

06:05.603 --> 06:08.304
... I'm capable of trying
to murder my husband?

06:08.612 --> 06:10.078
I do.

06:11.350 --> 06:12.698
Scottie.

06:13.326 --> 06:14.820
Howard.

06:17.953 --> 06:19.254
What's the matter?

06:19.256 --> 06:21.823
You all look like you've seen a ghost.

06:23.327 --> 06:27.462
So, who do you want to hear from first?

06:27.835 --> 06:31.132
I say brains before beauty.

06:31.134 --> 06:35.223
So, Scottie, you're up.

06:39.843 --> 06:41.410
Morning.

06:41.746 --> 06:43.878
Nothing about any HVAC units today.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.547
Well, I have four in the back,

06:45.549 --> 06:47.315
three other trips to make by lunch.

06:47.317 --> 06:49.032
Can I leave them with you?

06:49.486 --> 06:52.020
- Let... let's check them out.
- My man.

07:17.933 --> 07:20.027
If this feels like
déjà vu all over again,

07:20.068 --> 07:21.362
that's because it is.

07:21.387 --> 07:23.340
Six months ago, I came before the board

07:23.365 --> 07:24.830
because I had concluded...

07:24.855 --> 07:27.080
that the husband I loved
and adored was gone,

07:27.105 --> 07:28.939
that he had become delusional,

07:28.964 --> 07:31.274
and that it was your
fiduciary responsibility

07:31.276 --> 07:33.013
to remove him as head of this company.

07:33.038 --> 07:34.310
My company...

07:34.452 --> 07:37.920
which I created, in all
my delusional grandeur.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.646
You agreed with my assessment then,

07:40.648 --> 07:42.241
and everything that's happened since

07:42.266 --> 07:43.982
only reinforces the conclusion

07:43.984 --> 07:45.958
that Howard is not of sound mind.

07:45.983 --> 07:49.054
By his own admission,
he faked his death.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.671
Howard's not well.

07:51.592 --> 07:53.492
But he is dangerous.

07:53.494 --> 07:55.450
Since his tragic death,

07:55.452 --> 07:58.324
Howard's been pursuing the
Holy Grail of the digital age...

07:58.349 --> 07:59.765
quantum computing.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.500
Quantum computing's a pipe dream.

08:01.502 --> 08:03.135
No, it's not. It's real.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.337
The man responsible for
the breakthrough is here.

08:05.339 --> 08:07.127
As a prisoner.

08:07.152 --> 08:09.174
He's here so my husband can't force him

08:09.176 --> 08:11.009
to give him his technology.

08:11.011 --> 08:13.293
Howard knew about it, pursued it...

08:13.318 --> 08:16.286
in secret, away from
us, from this company.

08:16.311 --> 08:17.927
Why would he do that?

08:17.952 --> 08:20.819
There's only one explanation.

08:21.418 --> 08:25.043
Howard is no longer
working for this company.

08:25.426 --> 08:27.355
He is working against it.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.041
It's simple. Snatch, grab, and go.

08:33.066 --> 08:34.768
It'd be a lot simpler
if we had real bullets.

08:34.793 --> 08:35.967
- They do.
- No.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.379
Whitehall's being
held by people we know.

08:37.404 --> 08:39.270
They believe they're doing
the right thing. They're not.

08:39.273 --> 08:41.006
So tranqs only. That's
what you signed up for.

08:41.008 --> 08:42.698
Everything else gets left in the van.

08:43.842 --> 08:45.261
Everything.

08:47.053 --> 08:50.136
I am not normal.

08:50.175 --> 08:51.909
And I have no interest in being normal.

08:51.934 --> 08:53.452
I think normal is boring.

08:53.454 --> 08:55.120
I believe in conspiracies.

08:55.122 --> 08:58.524
I think delusions are
the same as dog whistles.

08:58.526 --> 09:00.058
Just because you can't
hear them or see them

09:00.060 --> 09:01.460
doesn't mean they're not real.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.530
We breach on Howard's signal.

09:04.532 --> 09:09.401
Now, not being normal isn't
the same as being nuts.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.314
Nuts would be faking your own death,

09:12.339 --> 09:13.550
and I didn't do that.

09:13.575 --> 09:15.496
You pretended to be dead.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.111
Isn't that the same thing?

09:17.136 --> 09:20.212
I didn't fake my death. I
simply avoided being murdered.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.745
- Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?

09:22.770 --> 09:25.558
This is...

09:25.583 --> 09:29.388
a preliminary report of the NTSB,

09:29.390 --> 09:31.698
indicating that the
landing gear on my plane

09:31.723 --> 09:33.464
had been tampered with.

09:37.196 --> 09:40.032
- See this?
- The QR code. So?

09:40.237 --> 09:42.503
The conference-room table
is covered with smart glass

09:42.528 --> 09:44.276
and is smart enough to read that.

09:44.301 --> 09:45.904
What'll the code tell it to do?

09:45.906 --> 09:47.639
Calculate chess positions

09:47.641 --> 09:50.676
for 100,000 games played simultaneously.

09:50.678 --> 09:52.578
You're gonna overheat the servers.

09:52.580 --> 09:53.912
Triggering a cooling protocol,

09:53.914 --> 09:55.625
which includes opening the air vents

09:55.650 --> 09:58.484
from the server room to the parking lot.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.787
We're in. Let's go.

10:02.422 --> 10:04.976
This warning light means
the servers are overheating,

10:05.001 --> 10:06.217
and they never overheat.

10:06.242 --> 10:07.392
I got to run a diagnostics.

10:07.394 --> 10:08.882
Get a tac team up to Level A.

10:08.907 --> 10:11.474
The NTSB report is inconclusive.

10:11.832 --> 10:13.265
Someone tampered with your landing gear,

10:13.267 --> 10:14.900
but it could've been you.

10:14.902 --> 10:17.468
And Scottie could be holding
Dr. Whitehall against his will

10:17.493 --> 10:18.773
to protect him from me

10:18.798 --> 10:21.850
and not to force him to build
a prototype of his invention,

10:21.875 --> 10:25.043
but I think we all know that she's not.

10:25.068 --> 10:28.080
Of course, we could ask him.

10:28.312 --> 10:30.949
What do you think, honey?
Should we call him in?

10:41.761 --> 10:43.095
Shh.

10:45.513 --> 10:47.648
You guys shouldn't be here.

10:50.069 --> 10:51.663
Who the hell are these guys?

10:51.688 --> 10:53.079
You don't want to know.

10:53.104 --> 10:55.504
We need the access codes. They
locked us out of the system.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.162
Yeah, well, you did try
to decapitate Solomon.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.921
No, we threw a bomb on his
head. It's a little different.

10:58.946 --> 11:00.224
But just give us the codes.

11:00.249 --> 11:02.416
He's fine, by the way. I'm
sure he'd love to see you.

11:04.317 --> 11:06.685
- Why don't I go tell him you're here?
- I love you, buddy.

11:06.687 --> 11:08.687
If you don't tell me
Whitehall's location

11:08.689 --> 11:10.067
and the code in the next five seconds...

11:10.092 --> 11:12.693
I will shoot you with a
tranq dart in the face.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.950
You would do that?

11:16.095 --> 11:17.450
Try me.

11:18.279 --> 11:19.525
LeBron.

11:19.954 --> 11:21.802
Really? LeBron?

11:22.568 --> 11:24.294
Cleveland against the world.

11:24.982 --> 11:27.286
The allegations you both made...

11:27.311 --> 11:28.583
could not be more serious.

11:28.608 --> 11:30.452
They are, and should be,

11:30.477 --> 11:32.711
the subject of a criminal investigation.

11:32.713 --> 11:35.880
The final decision of the
board will rest in part...

11:35.905 --> 11:38.116
on the outcome of that investigation,

11:38.118 --> 11:40.779
but that could take months,

11:40.804 --> 11:42.621
if not years.

11:42.973 --> 11:45.427
The company needs a direction now.

11:46.853 --> 11:48.870
Aah! Aah!

11:55.712 --> 11:57.119
By a show of hands,

11:57.144 --> 12:01.611
all those in favor of restoring
Howard Hargrave as CEO.

12:12.849 --> 12:15.487
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed!

12:20.816 --> 12:22.168
Aah!

12:22.193 --> 12:25.474
All those in favor of keeping
Scottie Hargrave in charge.

12:32.605 --> 12:34.869
Tranqs were a bad idea.
Grab a gun. Check on Vito.

12:34.894 --> 12:36.108
- Zip-tie these guys.
- Got it.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.009
Vito! You all right, man?

12:38.011 --> 12:39.419
Oh, man.

12:50.223 --> 12:51.654
Solomon.

12:57.168 --> 12:58.488
Nez.

12:59.966 --> 13:02.067
Nez, come on. Come on.

13:14.781 --> 13:17.048
You guys hang here and
wait for Howard's orders.

13:19.664 --> 13:22.414
Howard, I'm sorry.

13:22.439 --> 13:24.625
The vote was five to two against you.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.656
A count I assume Scottie
bought and paid for.

13:29.218 --> 13:31.765
I didn't come here to
win your vote, Jack.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.023
That's him. Let's go.

13:34.048 --> 13:35.715
Then, why did you come?

13:35.935 --> 13:37.534
To rescue Whitehall.

13:37.559 --> 13:40.760
Oh, and h-how do you
plan on doing that?

13:40.974 --> 13:43.031
By taking over this facility.

13:49.908 --> 13:51.142
Hear that?

13:52.685 --> 13:54.265
Anyone?

13:54.711 --> 13:58.423
That is the sound of a dog whistle.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.156
What is this, Howard?

14:03.367 --> 14:04.733
You want to tell us
what the hell's going on?

14:04.758 --> 14:06.592
- Patience.
- Howard, unlock the door.

14:06.617 --> 14:08.237
Dr. Whitehall will be released

14:08.239 --> 14:10.945
from Mrs. Hargrave's confinement
shortly, and he will explain.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.263
- If you don't release us...
- Unlock the door.

14:13.288 --> 14:14.375
When you hear the truth,

14:14.400 --> 14:16.468
when you hear what this woman
has been willing to do...

14:19.382 --> 14:21.907
Stay put. Everybody, stay put.

14:21.932 --> 14:23.719
Your chariot has arrived.

14:24.288 --> 14:25.420
Ah, ah, ah.

14:25.921 --> 14:27.248
Howard.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.682
Don't make him do
something you might regret.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.274
Let's go.

14:33.463 --> 14:35.007
We need to get to Whitehall.

14:35.032 --> 14:36.603
Tom and Nez might already be there.

14:36.628 --> 14:38.161
We know where he is. They may not.

14:38.163 --> 14:39.596
And after we get him? Unh-unh.

14:39.598 --> 14:41.194
I don't know yet.

14:41.219 --> 14:43.266
I'm taking it one crisis at a time.

14:43.268 --> 14:44.758
Great idea.

14:46.505 --> 14:49.506
Hold on, everyone. Just hold on.

14:49.508 --> 14:51.341
These two fine gentlemen, misters...

14:51.343 --> 14:52.475
Devon.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.677
Jimmy.

14:53.679 --> 14:56.313
Mr. Devon and Mr. Jimmy
are here to protect you.

14:56.315 --> 14:57.948
You really have lost your mind.

14:57.950 --> 14:59.657
No one leaves.

15:06.903 --> 15:09.696
- Time to go.
- You're not safe here.

15:13.633 --> 15:14.865
Go! Go!

15:14.867 --> 15:16.132
Scottie!

15:25.216 --> 15:27.144
With me... now.

15:27.146 --> 15:28.979
I want you to bring up the sub-basement.

15:28.981 --> 15:31.648
- The surveillance feeds, schematics?
- Everything.

15:40.658 --> 15:41.912
Scottie, stop!

15:42.995 --> 15:44.232
Go!

15:57.314 --> 15:59.029
The code doesn't work.

15:59.453 --> 16:01.481
And these windows are bulletproof.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.060
He's having way too much fun.

16:06.669 --> 16:09.044
What's going on? I demand you let me go.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.177
I changed the key code.

16:10.202 --> 16:11.607
Buys us a little time but not much.

16:11.632 --> 16:13.924
Howard has control of the
system. He can unlock it.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.599
Not anymore.

16:22.751 --> 16:25.282
They knocked us off the
grid. We're on reserve juice.

16:25.677 --> 16:28.405
Scottie's got Whitehall
barricaded in the sub-basement.

16:28.407 --> 16:29.940
Wouldn't cutting the
power cause the doors

16:29.942 --> 16:31.074
to automatically unlock?

16:31.076 --> 16:33.376
In the even of a power loss, the
lock will automatically engage.

16:33.378 --> 16:34.544
What about the cargo elevator?

16:34.546 --> 16:36.780
That's not on the reserve system.
They can't get out that way.

16:36.782 --> 16:38.111
Meaning we can't get in.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.999
Oh, there are other ways to get in.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.867
Damn it.

16:55.154 --> 16:57.994
Solomon, put her on the phone.

17:00.137 --> 17:01.605
Scottie, think about this.

17:01.607 --> 17:03.039
You can't get out,

17:03.041 --> 17:05.587
and in four minutes, we're coming in.

17:05.612 --> 17:07.118
I'm not giving him to Howard.

17:07.144 --> 17:08.866
You don't have a choice.

17:10.249 --> 17:11.720
Howard...

17:11.886 --> 17:14.684
remember the World Summit
on Innovation? Geneva?

17:14.685 --> 17:16.819
We stayed up all night
working on your speech,

17:16.821 --> 17:20.323
how quantum computing would
outstrip human capabilities,

17:20.325 --> 17:22.439
that if its development
wasn't managed carefully,

17:22.464 --> 17:25.422
humanity would risk
engineering its own extinction?

17:25.446 --> 17:26.579
You convinced me then

17:26.604 --> 17:28.431
we could never let that kind of power

17:28.433 --> 17:32.758
fall into the hands of some
deranged, maniacal madman.

17:32.783 --> 17:35.138
I just never thought
that madman would be you.

17:35.163 --> 17:36.986
You're not in the
boardroom anymore, honey.

17:37.011 --> 17:38.720
You can drop the act.

17:40.033 --> 17:43.242
Scottie, you don't have any leverage.

17:43.267 --> 17:44.884
Of course I do.

17:45.152 --> 17:47.083
Please don't make me use it.

17:50.767 --> 17:52.094
Come through that door,

17:52.119 --> 17:54.953
and I will put a bullet
through Whitehall's head.

17:54.978 --> 17:56.259
The hell you will!

17:56.284 --> 17:58.447
Scottie, don't... don't do this.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.822
Are you... are you there?

18:04.800 --> 18:06.312
What the hell do you think you're doing?

18:06.337 --> 18:08.494
If I'm going to die,

18:08.526 --> 18:12.134
I'd like to die in my bed, in my sleep,

18:12.159 --> 18:15.427
having told my wife I love her,

18:16.119 --> 18:19.868
perhaps re-reading the
final chapter of "Moby-Dick."

18:19.870 --> 18:22.970
Unfortunately for you, sir,
there is only one way out.

18:23.438 --> 18:25.603
We can commandeer the elevator.

18:25.657 --> 18:26.876
Not possible.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.228
We've been cut off from the power grid,

18:28.253 --> 18:30.787
and reserve power does not
go to the cargo elevator.

18:30.812 --> 18:32.879
Even if you can get
the elevator to work,

18:32.904 --> 18:34.637
Howard will know the second you do.

18:34.694 --> 18:36.033
Well...

18:37.587 --> 18:39.783
that's your problem to solve.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.650
I'm worried about getting out alive.

18:50.536 --> 18:52.182
We're almost in.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.526
I'm not convinced that's gonna work.

18:59.324 --> 19:01.090
Mr. Solomon, is it?

19:01.092 --> 19:04.190
Are you familiar with Schrodinger's cat?

19:04.215 --> 19:05.900
Oh, yes. It's a paradox.

19:05.925 --> 19:07.597
Cat's sealed in the box with poison,

19:07.599 --> 19:09.566
simultaneously alive and dead

19:09.568 --> 19:12.035
until you open up the
box and observe it.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.159
Exactly.

19:13.184 --> 19:15.618
This is nothing like that.

19:17.878 --> 19:21.635
When they open this
box, we're just dead.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.659
They're almost in. You
got two minutes or less.

19:27.565 --> 19:28.666
_

19:31.258 --> 19:33.092
It works. Get in.

19:33.094 --> 19:35.027
This should give us about
30 seconds' worth of lift.

19:35.029 --> 19:36.528
That'll get us to the next floor.

19:55.149 --> 19:57.587
They're on the move. Lock down Bay Six.

19:57.612 --> 19:59.545
They're getting away. Go. Go now.

20:02.448 --> 20:04.101
Well, here goes our ride now.

20:04.126 --> 20:05.390
You don't have any bullets.

20:05.392 --> 20:06.726
He doesn't know that.

20:15.401 --> 20:17.024
Hey! Scottie!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.637
We got company.

20:22.157 --> 20:23.587
Come on.

20:23.612 --> 20:25.845
Please don't shoot. Don't shoot.

20:32.085 --> 20:33.501
Come on.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.696
There's nothing we can do,
Scottie. Get in the car.

20:54.857 --> 20:57.891
Dr. Whitehall, you are safe now.

20:58.318 --> 21:01.100
That seems to be the only thing
you and your wife agree on.

21:01.709 --> 21:04.565
- Speaking of Scottie...
- No. Or Solomon.

21:05.094 --> 21:06.092
If you'll come with me, sir,

21:06.117 --> 21:07.785
there are some people
I'd like you to meet.

21:08.410 --> 21:10.202
I want everyone released.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.660
They were trying to kill us.

21:11.685 --> 21:13.105
They were only doing their jobs.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.568
Take everyone into the command center.

21:14.593 --> 21:16.351
I'll be there as soon as I can.

21:18.662 --> 21:20.835
Just hold still. Hold still.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.053
Okay, there.

21:25.496 --> 21:26.938
Keep the pressure on.

21:28.551 --> 21:31.038
You're closer to
Scottie than anyone else.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.474
Do you believe what
he's saying about her?

21:38.591 --> 21:40.100
Apologies.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.607
Where's Scottie?

21:41.712 --> 21:43.979
I would like to introduce
Richard Whitehall.

21:44.004 --> 21:45.998
Where is she? Is she all right?

21:46.023 --> 21:47.990
I don't know, and,
yeah, Scottie is unhurt.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.229
I wish everyone was.

21:49.230 --> 21:51.731
I genuinely regret having to resort

21:51.734 --> 21:53.006
to such extreme measures.

21:53.031 --> 21:56.107
You can't take the
company back by force.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.926
You need our consent.

21:57.951 --> 22:00.029
Agreed. And if I don't get it,
I'm prepared to walk away...

22:00.054 --> 22:03.403
after you hear what Dr.
Whitehall has to say.

22:03.428 --> 22:04.975
I did what I thought I had to do

22:05.000 --> 22:07.300
in order for you to hear him out.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.737
And I'm very sorry, but it seems like

22:09.762 --> 22:12.396
a small price to pay for the truth.

22:12.421 --> 22:13.679
Doctor.

22:14.592 --> 22:16.475
I'll do my best.

22:17.748 --> 22:20.623
To begin with, I am not in business...

22:20.648 --> 22:22.521
with Howard Hargrave.

22:23.332 --> 22:27.443
I'm here because I was
abducted by Scottie Hargrave.

22:28.318 --> 22:30.405
You all must be very confused.

22:30.407 --> 22:32.356
I know I would be.

22:32.381 --> 22:34.325
To those who stood against me,

22:34.350 --> 22:37.387
you did what you were trained
to do, defend the company.

22:37.412 --> 22:39.037
To those who stood with me,

22:39.062 --> 22:40.647
I ask you to accept that...

22:40.672 --> 22:43.512
we must now all work together.

22:43.537 --> 22:46.053
To those loyal to Scottie,

22:46.055 --> 22:47.521
I'll tell you what I told the board.

22:47.523 --> 22:49.489
I'm only interested in the truth.

22:49.514 --> 22:51.771
She will have her day in court.

22:52.310 --> 22:54.365
But, first, we have to find her.

22:54.646 --> 22:57.692
Anyone who is not comfortable
with that mission...

22:57.717 --> 22:59.533
may leave now...

22:59.722 --> 23:01.396
with my blessings.

23:05.766 --> 23:07.718
Thank you. That's all.

23:08.917 --> 23:10.184
Dumont.

23:10.209 --> 23:11.741
Sir.

23:13.648 --> 23:15.382
You knew that they had
access to the elevator,

23:15.384 --> 23:17.023
and yet, you said nothing.

23:17.101 --> 23:19.319
And that allowed Scottie to escape.

23:19.321 --> 23:21.671
Now you're gonna help us find her.

23:22.060 --> 23:24.960
How did my team access the facility?

23:25.890 --> 23:30.271
You... programmed the
servers to overheat,

23:30.296 --> 23:31.965
opening the vents.

23:32.476 --> 23:34.585
Which shut down the network.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.452
I want you to get it back up.

23:38.031 --> 23:39.546
Yes, sir.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.274
That's what it looks
like, not what it is.

23:47.276 --> 23:49.110
Look, Dr. Whitehall sees it differently.

23:49.112 --> 23:51.312
- I held him for his own good.
- You made your case.

23:51.314 --> 23:53.280
- I kept him from Howard.
- Howard made his.

23:53.282 --> 23:55.983
- Oh, and now you're siding with him?
- Whitehall sided with him.

23:55.985 --> 23:57.985
- Yeah, well, that's only because...
- Let it go, Scottie.

23:57.987 --> 23:59.806
You've got other things to worry about.

23:59.831 --> 24:02.765
I just got the results of
an internal investigation

24:02.790 --> 24:05.224
launched after Howard's
press conference.

24:05.249 --> 24:09.289
There is a string of financial
irregularities on your watch,

24:09.314 --> 24:12.148
including several
off-the-book facilities.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.750
- Who's seen this?
- Everyone.

24:14.775 --> 24:17.109
Scottie, I don't know what you've done,

24:17.134 --> 24:18.898
and I don't want to know.

24:18.923 --> 24:20.456
Do yourself a favor.

24:20.481 --> 24:24.060
Whatever it is, get ahead of it.

24:24.910 --> 24:26.393
Here's what we owe you.

24:26.418 --> 24:28.983
Let me know how to contact
Zeke and Vito's families,

24:28.985 --> 24:30.563
and I'll make sure they get their share.

24:30.588 --> 24:32.014
Thanks, man.

24:32.039 --> 24:33.631
Hey, one more thing.

24:35.918 --> 24:38.500
- You're done selling drugs to Nez.
- Tom.

24:39.162 --> 24:41.729
All due respect, playboy,
man's got to make a living.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.019
All due respect, Nez is
like a daughter to Howard,

24:44.044 --> 24:46.911
which means she's like a sister to me.

24:46.936 --> 24:48.969
I think you can see we're pretty
generous with those who help.

24:48.994 --> 24:51.918
I'm a lot less generous
with those who don't.

24:51.943 --> 24:53.346
You got me?

25:14.432 --> 25:15.656
Where are you? You all right?

25:15.681 --> 25:17.565
I'm nowhere close to all right.

25:17.567 --> 25:18.833
But I do have a plan,

25:18.835 --> 25:20.483
and I need your help to carry it out.

25:20.508 --> 25:21.520
Yeah, whatever you need.

25:21.545 --> 25:23.678
Is the Artax Network back online?

25:23.703 --> 25:24.907
Dumont's working on it.

25:24.932 --> 25:26.420
I need him to stop.

25:27.549 --> 25:29.978
Okay. Uh, yeah, of
course. I'll tell him.

25:30.003 --> 25:32.046
Howard's looking everywhere for me.

25:32.048 --> 25:34.615
I need to get across town
without him finding me.

25:34.617 --> 25:35.703
Okay, but then where are you gonna go?

25:35.728 --> 25:37.706
Just tell Dumont.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.309
Is the system online yet?

25:45.730 --> 25:47.193
Working as fast as I can, okay?

25:47.218 --> 25:48.817
Just got to reboot this server.

25:48.842 --> 25:49.920
Wait.

25:51.142 --> 25:52.967
I, uh, talked to Scottie.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.778
She's fine, but she's on the run,

25:54.803 --> 25:56.303
doesn't really want us looking for her.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.638
Hargrave wants the network up.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.311
She wants it down. Just 20 more minutes.

26:00.336 --> 26:03.386
Did you know about Whitehall?
About her holding him?

26:04.317 --> 26:05.361
She's been good to me.

26:05.386 --> 26:07.086
She's been good to me, too.

26:07.450 --> 26:09.693
And I'm not sure what's
right or wrong here...

26:09.718 --> 26:11.255
online, offline,

26:12.065 --> 26:15.013
but I have to decide whether
to flip the switch or not.

26:15.467 --> 26:16.648
And before I do, I want to know

26:16.673 --> 26:19.054
if she told you about Whitehall.

26:21.071 --> 26:22.672
Is the network up yet?

26:22.697 --> 26:24.565
I got one last problem to solve.

26:24.590 --> 26:26.156
Kat's helping me with it.

26:26.374 --> 26:27.540
With what?

26:27.565 --> 26:29.288
Simple binary choice.

26:29.871 --> 26:32.138
Did she or didn't she? Yes or no?

26:38.717 --> 26:40.985
No. She didn't.

26:43.459 --> 26:44.985
Okay. Good.

26:44.987 --> 26:47.188
That's the answer I
needed. We're good to go.

26:57.218 --> 26:58.285
System's up.

26:58.310 --> 26:59.983
Process every image... satellite,

27:00.008 --> 27:03.099
CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.

27:03.124 --> 27:05.158
I want to know the second you get a hit.

27:06.137 --> 27:09.306
If we find her, what's
gonna happen to her?

27:11.980 --> 27:13.406
Justice.

27:13.988 --> 27:15.785
I loved her once.

27:16.185 --> 27:18.150
In some ways, I still do.

27:19.173 --> 27:21.005
I know how difficult this is,

27:21.030 --> 27:23.065
but it's the right thing to do.

27:23.693 --> 27:26.033
I want to thank you
for helping me do it.

27:36.192 --> 27:38.883
So, how are we playing this?

27:39.219 --> 27:40.907
The intel Marienthal showed me,

27:40.932 --> 27:42.812
for all we know, Howard's seen it.

27:43.827 --> 27:45.795
You think Howard's guys will be here?

27:45.887 --> 27:46.952
I don't know.

27:46.977 --> 27:49.304
So we have to assume the answer is yes.

27:50.470 --> 27:53.892
Well, then, there's only
one way to play this.

27:57.159 --> 27:58.373
Let's do it.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.682
Guys, I think I got them.

28:00.945 --> 28:01.960
Where?

28:01.985 --> 28:04.069
A former pharmaceutical
plant in Williamsburg.

28:04.094 --> 28:05.275
Corner of Flushing and Spring.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.532
Dumont, call in the FBI.

28:06.557 --> 28:08.217
Bring up any images
you have of the area.

28:08.219 --> 28:09.785
We'll meet the FBI there.

28:11.421 --> 28:13.363
- Everybody on the ground.
- Oh!

28:13.388 --> 28:14.767
Come on. Hands up in the air. Now.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.406
I-I don't understand.
What are you doing?

28:16.431 --> 28:17.593
Who else is here? How many?

28:17.595 --> 28:20.206
You know how many,
Scottie. Nine per shift.

28:20.231 --> 28:21.395
How do you know her name?

28:21.420 --> 28:23.287
I should know her name. She hired me.

28:23.312 --> 28:24.944
She hired all of us.

28:28.419 --> 28:29.668
- Hey!
- Hey.

28:29.693 --> 28:30.926
Careful.

28:30.951 --> 28:32.281
I am just...

28:32.704 --> 28:34.395
I-I want to show you something.

28:39.157 --> 28:42.381
Work orders for the
week, all signed by you.

28:43.007 --> 28:45.612
I've got three months' worth in back.

28:48.410 --> 28:50.882
Purifiers, flame extractors.

28:51.841 --> 28:53.581
This is made up, all of it.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.958
I think you know that it's not made up.

29:05.701 --> 29:07.656
Whitehall prototype.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.992
You want to tell me what's
going on here, Scottie?

29:14.994 --> 29:17.429
A frame-up. That's what's going on.

29:17.802 --> 29:19.503
And I fell right into it.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.763
Keen, Rowan. We're with Halcyon.

29:22.788 --> 29:25.469
Agents Lamb and Noxon,
FBI. What are we looking at?

29:25.471 --> 29:27.271
Friends of ours. Very
armed, very dangerous.

29:27.273 --> 29:29.304
What's here? What's inside?

29:29.329 --> 29:31.719
- We don't know.
- Curious to find out.

29:31.744 --> 29:34.211
- You've never been here before.
- No.

29:34.213 --> 29:36.832
And you do not know these guys.

29:38.607 --> 29:40.234
Look at me, Scottie.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.154
If Howard set you up,

29:43.156 --> 29:45.322
then the cops will be on their way.

29:45.324 --> 29:46.896
We got to move.

29:52.076 --> 29:54.144
Federal agents! Don't move!

29:59.852 --> 30:01.266
All right. Go back to the lab.

30:01.291 --> 30:04.035
Find a different way out.
I'll lay down cover fire.

30:31.019 --> 30:32.587
There are too many.

30:32.589 --> 30:34.088
If I can get to one of the techs,

30:34.090 --> 30:35.957
I'll take one of them as a hostage.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.123
Gun down.

30:37.148 --> 30:38.317
_

30:40.129 --> 30:42.208
Somebody's gonna put their gun down,

30:42.233 --> 30:43.703
but it's not gonna be me.

30:49.154 --> 30:50.738
You backed the wrong horse, Nez.

30:50.740 --> 30:53.447
Oh, Matty, I didn't think you
believed in right and wrong.

30:53.472 --> 30:54.876
Scottie is the good guy here.

30:54.878 --> 30:56.544
Scottie lied about everything.

30:56.546 --> 30:58.212
She's not who we thought she was.

30:58.214 --> 30:59.843
This place is proof of that.

30:59.868 --> 31:03.503
I hope that the truth comes
out in the justice system.

31:03.813 --> 31:05.720
But since I don't intend on
letting the justice system

31:05.722 --> 31:08.099
deliberate the truth about me,

31:08.430 --> 31:10.511
this is where I step off.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.558
The only surviving member of the Pequod.

31:13.969 --> 31:16.505
It's the whaling ship in "Moby-Dick."

31:16.530 --> 31:17.997
Oh, it went down.

31:18.273 --> 31:21.718
Took everyone with it except Ishmael.

31:22.276 --> 31:24.112
And how did he survive?

31:28.242 --> 31:30.396
"Buoyed up by that coffin,

31:30.780 --> 31:33.983
"I floated on a soft
and dirge-like main.

31:34.941 --> 31:36.708
"The unharming sharks,

31:36.733 --> 31:40.630
"they glided by as if with
padlocks on their mouths.

31:41.494 --> 31:44.863
"On the second day, a sail drew near.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.725
"It was the devious-cruising Rachel,

31:48.228 --> 31:52.091
"that in her retracing search
after her missing children,

31:53.140 --> 31:54.889
"only found...

31:57.044 --> 31:58.604
"another orphan."

32:01.395 --> 32:02.900
I'll find you.

32:03.859 --> 32:05.670
God, I hope so.

32:20.338 --> 32:22.204
Stop it. Stop!

32:22.504 --> 32:24.342
Stop! It's over. It's over.

32:25.838 --> 32:27.440
Howard's setting me up.

32:27.442 --> 32:29.335
If that's true, then come in.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.530
If you're really innocent,
then you have nothing to hide.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.873
I can't. I can't do that.

32:33.898 --> 32:36.075
Well, that sounds like guilty.

32:36.934 --> 32:40.153
Look, I understand why it's
hard for you to believe me,

32:40.155 --> 32:43.433
but we both know Howard did
something incredibly cruel

32:43.458 --> 32:44.891
when he sent you to me

32:44.916 --> 32:47.416
and didn't allow you to
tell me that you're my son,

32:47.441 --> 32:49.974
that after all these
years, you're still alive.

32:50.853 --> 32:52.470
That cruelty was also a blessing,

32:52.495 --> 32:56.771
because you got to see how
I truly feel about my son,

32:56.796 --> 32:58.263
that I never stopped loving him.

32:58.288 --> 33:00.450
I never stopped loving you.

33:03.419 --> 33:05.266
If you know how I feel,

33:05.291 --> 33:07.280
then you know who I am.

33:07.282 --> 33:10.759
And if you know that, can
you honestly tell me...

33:10.784 --> 33:13.490
that you believe what
Howard says about me?

33:24.908 --> 33:26.478
Today, I can.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.317
Susan Hargrave, you're under arrest

33:33.342 --> 33:35.249
for kidnapping and false imprisonment.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.810
You have the right to remain silent.

33:36.812 --> 33:38.612
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

33:38.614 --> 33:40.008
in a court of law.

33:47.494 --> 33:49.240
My answer's no.

33:50.569 --> 33:53.433
Usually, we like to get
the question out first.

33:53.458 --> 33:55.236
You showed me the NTSB report.

33:55.261 --> 33:58.645
It says the landing gear on
Howard's plane was tampered with.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.603
You want to know if I think she did it.

34:00.628 --> 34:01.792
Do you?

34:01.817 --> 34:03.248
Of course she did it.

34:03.921 --> 34:05.975
This an accurate prototype?

34:06.507 --> 34:07.761
Completely.

34:07.786 --> 34:09.351
I can't believe how close she came.

34:09.377 --> 34:10.784
And it could've only
been built by someone

34:10.786 --> 34:12.476
who had access to my research.

34:12.502 --> 34:14.686
And no one had that other
than Scottie Hargrave?

34:14.710 --> 34:16.192
Scottie Hargrave and me.

34:16.237 --> 34:18.866
You were the only ones authorized
to make payments from this account.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.126
That's right.

34:20.150 --> 34:22.199
This is a payment
schedule from the account.

34:22.225 --> 34:24.839
Everything related to the
construction of the prototype,

34:24.864 --> 34:27.391
Mrs. Hargrave denies
knowing anything about.

34:27.416 --> 34:29.916
7:29 a.m. on 3/1.

34:29.918 --> 34:31.927
11:45 p.m. on 3/9.

34:31.952 --> 34:34.462
6:15 a.m. on 3:17.

34:36.225 --> 34:37.935
If you're asking me whether
I made these payments,

34:37.960 --> 34:39.326
the answer is no.

34:39.351 --> 34:42.097
I wasn't even working at these times.

34:42.130 --> 34:44.697
So, if Ms. Carlson
didn't make the payments,

34:44.699 --> 34:46.224
then it must've been you.

34:51.438 --> 34:52.822
Gotcha.

35:19.027 --> 35:21.164
I'm sorry it ended this way.

35:21.189 --> 35:22.556
Yeah, me too.

35:23.819 --> 35:25.156
What you said before about me

35:25.181 --> 35:26.229
being like a sister to you...

35:26.254 --> 35:27.436
I meant it.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.548
Good.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.984
Whatever help you need.

36:23.513 --> 36:25.638
I like what you've done with the place.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.101
How does it feel?

36:32.792 --> 36:34.462
It feels...

36:35.014 --> 36:36.387
right...

36:36.411 --> 36:39.576
this, being here with you.

36:41.565 --> 36:43.596
You know, my daughter turns...

36:44.319 --> 36:46.186
she turns 1 next week.

36:48.951 --> 36:50.301
This isn't the end, you know?

36:50.326 --> 36:51.992
This is just the beginning.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.326
Yeah.

36:54.287 --> 36:56.572
For our family, which I hope...

36:59.185 --> 37:01.167
I want you to be a part of.

37:01.899 --> 37:05.237
And I want you to be a part of this.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.040
I know.

37:07.042 --> 37:09.109
Maybe, someday.

37:11.045 --> 37:12.345
Who knows?

37:12.347 --> 37:16.283
For now, I am going home
to my daughter's birthday.

37:16.308 --> 37:18.546
Well, of course you are. You should.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.254
You're coming to the party by the way.

37:21.256 --> 37:23.887
It's a princess theme, so
I hope you've got a tiara.

37:24.532 --> 37:26.039
I wouldn't miss it.

37:29.229 --> 37:30.807
You did it, Dad.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.686
We did, son.

37:41.071 --> 37:42.476
Together.

37:46.573 --> 37:49.049
- Tiara?
- Yeah, you got it.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.145
Hey. Saved you a piece of cheesecake.

37:55.170 --> 37:57.965
- Cheesecake?
- Yeah, cheesecake.

37:58.660 --> 38:01.839
The truth is, I knew you'd
come back sooner or later,

38:01.864 --> 38:02.908
that it was only a matter of time

38:02.933 --> 38:04.432
before you realized what a huge mistake

38:04.457 --> 38:06.967
- it was to dump me.
- Can you explain this?

38:07.333 --> 38:09.041
Explain what? What... what is it?

38:09.066 --> 38:10.770
Payment authorizations.

38:11.140 --> 38:14.081
For the construction of a
sophisticated computer prototype.

38:14.106 --> 38:15.813
- What is there to...
- Look at the dates and times.

38:15.838 --> 38:17.631
- I don't...
- Look at the dates and times!

38:17.656 --> 38:19.723
Okay, okay. I'm looking.

38:19.748 --> 38:21.748
- What am I looking at?
- Transactions.

38:21.750 --> 38:23.149
Made from my computer

38:23.151 --> 38:24.819
and dates and times
when we were together.

38:24.844 --> 38:28.096
All except one that
was made on my phone...

38:28.121 --> 38:29.542
after you switched it with yours,

38:29.567 --> 38:33.185
after you made it look like
it was an innocent mistake.

38:33.554 --> 38:35.228
It was you, wasn't it?

38:35.230 --> 38:37.230
You were working with
Howard the whole time.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.732
He used you to get close to her,

38:38.757 --> 38:41.291
to get access to her files.

38:41.827 --> 38:43.782
It was you that made it all work.

38:43.807 --> 38:45.614
The frame-up. Making it look like

38:45.640 --> 38:47.795
Scottie was this guilty...

38:47.820 --> 38:50.253
Couldn't get to her
files. She was too smart.

38:50.278 --> 38:51.850
But you...

38:51.875 --> 38:54.080
you actually thought I cared.

38:55.668 --> 38:56.985
I'm sorry.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.895
Last thing anyone's
ever gonna say to you is,

38:58.920 --> 39:00.934
"This is all your fault."

39:38.727 --> 39:40.086
- Is he here?
- Yes, sir.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.769
Arrived an hour ago.

39:44.068 --> 39:45.622
Now, my flight leaves in two hours.

39:47.002 --> 39:48.718
I should be home for dinner.

39:48.743 --> 39:50.454
Like you said when I left,

39:50.479 --> 39:52.826
what could possibly go wrong?

40:11.641 --> 40:14.271
Kat. Jesus! What happened?

40:14.659 --> 40:16.470
What is this? What's on this?

40:17.063 --> 40:18.288
The truth.

40:19.096 --> 40:20.341
It's him.

40:49.119 --> 40:50.530
Where are we?

40:52.439 --> 40:55.419
We are operational.
