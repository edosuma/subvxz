01:46.033 --> 01:49.000
- People are always looking
to have their fortunes told.

01:50.433 --> 01:52.433
They get their cards read,
their palms read,

01:52.500 --> 01:54.166
even the bumps
on their head.

01:54.233 --> 01:55.533
Well, if that card
ain't credit,

01:55.600 --> 01:56.900
why read it?

01:56.967 --> 01:57.900
If that palm ain't
holding something,

01:57.967 --> 01:59.333
let it go,
and shit,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.567
if you've got bumps
on your head big enough to read,

02:01.633 --> 02:03.033
forget about
your future, yo,

02:03.100 --> 02:06.333
because your problems
are in the here and now.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.767
- Ahmad Lalar was murdered
by James Robson.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.467
- You keep saying that,
but you offer no proof.

02:17.533 --> 02:19.467
Look, I need evidence.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.800
A witness,
the murder weapon, anything.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.700
- Robson may not have
sliced Ahmad himself.

02:25.767 --> 02:27.533
He may have assigned
another Aryan to do the job,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.367
as he did
Salah Udeen.

02:29.433 --> 02:31.233
- Then getting a conviction
is gonna be even harder.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.767
- So what do you
intend to do, warden?

02:32.834 --> 02:34.066
- Continue
the investigation.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.467
- Oh, yes,
you drag out the process,

02:35.533 --> 02:37.166
hoping that everyone's
gonna forget?

02:37.233 --> 02:39.900
Let me tell you this,
warden.

02:39.967 --> 02:41.233
We won't forget.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.333
- Lalar's death
must not go unpunished.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.000
- It won't.

02:49.066 --> 02:50.633
Believe me,
Robson's day of reckoning

02:50.700 --> 02:52.200
and retribution is coming.

02:52.266 --> 02:55.266
- Mail call!

02:57.934 --> 03:02.266
- Yo, um, you got
Minister Said's mail in there?

03:02.333 --> 03:03.934
- You know, Omar,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.533
I discovered that the minister
and I have something in common.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.000
- Yeah, okay.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.767
- We both
support slavery.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.000
For me, slavery
don't exist anymore,

03:14.066 --> 03:15.800
which is
a damned shame.

03:15.867 --> 03:18.567
But according to this book
in the library,

03:18.633 --> 03:19.967
for those Muslims,

03:20.033 --> 03:23.800
slavery is alive
and well in Africa.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.133
That's right.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.433
I figured Said
must've known that, too,

03:27.500 --> 03:29.834
since he went
and got himself one.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.767
You.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.300
- What the fuck
you jabbing about?

03:33.367 --> 03:36.233
I ain't nobody's motherfucking
slave and shit, man.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.867
- You tote that barge,
you lift that bale.

03:38.934 --> 03:42.567
You's his house nigger.

03:42.633 --> 03:43.567
- You motherfucker!

03:43.633 --> 03:44.600
- Omar!

03:44.667 --> 03:46.500
Come here!

03:46.567 --> 03:48.033
- Yo, look, I know
I ain't supposed to fight, but--

03:48.100 --> 03:50.567
but don't no-motherfucking-body
talk to me like that!

03:50.633 --> 03:52.300
- Come here now!

03:52.367 --> 03:54.133
all:
Oooh!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.333
- You heard that shit, yo?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.567
- Fuck, huh?

04:06.633 --> 04:07.934
I am your
fucking nigger, huh?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.633
Fuck!

04:15.300 --> 04:18.600

04:49.567 --> 04:51.734
- What was Reggie Rawls
doing in this room?

04:51.800 --> 04:52.934
- Oh, Reggie?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
He's a big fan, man.

04:55.467 --> 04:57.633
- He's a major drug dealer
in Unit C.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.033
- No, yo, man, he hear music,
he drawn in and shit.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.767
- Omar...

05:08.100 --> 05:10.600
Are you selling drugs
from this room?

05:10.667 --> 05:12.800
- No.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.900
- Are you
selling drugs?

05:15.967 --> 05:17.400
- Well, yeah--
yeah, man.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.834
What the fuck?
Huh, shit.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.233
I mean, shit, I ain't
doing them and shit, man,

05:20.300 --> 05:21.433
or using them
or nothing.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.633
You know,
what you thinking, man?

05:22.700 --> 05:23.900
I mean, that's
the deal, ain't it?

05:23.967 --> 05:25.000
- No, it is not.

05:25.066 --> 05:27.033
Selling drugs
is using them.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.867
- My piss test
say different.

05:28.934 --> 05:30.867
- I don't care
what your drug tests say.

05:30.934 --> 05:33.233
It's what I  say
that matters.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.166
- Yeah?

05:35.233 --> 05:38.033
- Well,
I say fuck you.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.600
Watch,
fuck you.

05:41.667 --> 05:45.567
- No, fuck you!

05:45.633 --> 05:47.200
- Hey, yo, Said...

05:47.266 --> 05:48.967
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!

05:49.033 --> 05:50.266
- Oh, no!

05:50.333 --> 05:52.166
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- No! No!

05:52.233 --> 05:54.867
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you!
- No! Help!

06:02.867 --> 06:04.133
- I'm waiting.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.166
- For what?

06:06.233 --> 06:07.433
- An explanation.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.433
- Like I said,
for what?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.166
- For the beating
you put on White.

06:12.233 --> 06:16.200
- A reason makes
a difference, McManus?

06:16.266 --> 06:18.633
I beat him!

06:18.700 --> 06:21.333
I failed him,

06:21.400 --> 06:22.467
him and myself.

06:22.533 --> 06:23.834
- Everything
was going so well.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.166
Why didn't you
come to me?

06:25.233 --> 06:27.200
- You don't get it, McManus,
you don't get it.

06:27.266 --> 06:29.266
- The only thing I need to get
from you is an explanation.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.533
And until I do,
you can fucking rot!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.700
Why?

06:38.767 --> 06:41.300
Why?

06:48.133 --> 06:49.834
- I tell you, I don't know
why the motherfucker

06:49.900 --> 06:51.300
attacked me, man!

06:51.367 --> 06:53.000
- You're beat to shit
for no reason, bullshit.

06:53.066 --> 06:54.867
- All right, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

06:54.934 --> 06:56.900
But look, don't let what I say
blur the fact that

06:56.967 --> 06:58.533
what I'm getting ready
to fucking tell you

06:58.600 --> 07:00.400
is the absolute, straight up,
goddamn, motherfucking truth.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.333
You understand?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.066
I was moving drugs,
okay?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.700
- You're fucking
shitting me.

07:06.767 --> 07:07.934
From your
practice room?

07:08.000 --> 07:08.934
- No, man, look, wait,
hear me out.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.433
I was threatened.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.433
I mean,
I didn't do nothing, man.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166
I swear to fucking God,
I didn't touch shit.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.333
- Who are you
moving them for?

07:15.400 --> 07:16.767
- If I tell you that, man,
I'm dead.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.300
I'm seriously dead.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.467
- All right, all right,
let's put that aside for now.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.100
- McManus,
I am clean, man!

07:22.166 --> 07:23.433
I am clean--

07:23.500 --> 07:24.834
Like, fucking spotless.
- Shut up!

07:24.900 --> 07:27.800
Will you fucking
shut up one second?

07:27.867 --> 07:30.767
- I'm just--just afraid

07:30.834 --> 07:33.000
you're gonna put me back in
Solitary again, man.

07:33.066 --> 07:35.667
- Goddamnit, Omar,
I oughta.

07:35.734 --> 07:38.200
All right, all right, all right,
here's the deal.

07:38.266 --> 07:40.400
From now on,
you rehearse in your pod.

07:40.467 --> 07:42.500
No more
fucking practice room.

07:42.567 --> 07:45.133
And if your piss shows even
a hint of aspirin, you're toast.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.734
Okay?

07:46.800 --> 07:47.834
Do you
understand me?

07:47.900 --> 07:49.367
- I hear you.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.834
Afternoon, gents.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.467
- Our Imam is in the hole
'cause of you.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.233
- Uh-uh.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.433
That motherfucker's in there
'cause he can't get a grip

08:06.500 --> 08:08.433
on his own
goddamn guidance.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.133
- You're toxic, White.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.100
You managed to turn
the only person on your side

08:16.166 --> 08:18.033
against you.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.066
The rest of us,
we saw this disaster coming.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.400
Every day Said
is in the hole

08:24.467 --> 08:28.033
is a day
you're out here alone.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.734
- Yeah?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
Well, I gotta
go practice.

08:42.033 --> 08:43.066
Fuck me.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.066
I hate your voices.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.967
- Hey, McManus.

09:07.233 --> 09:09.834
- Lockdown's in
a couple of minutes.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.133
Why aren't you
in your pod?

09:11.200 --> 09:14.033
- Look,
where you headed to?

09:14.100 --> 09:16.633
To the hole?

09:16.700 --> 09:18.266
You know, 'cause maybe you
and me should go on over there,

09:18.333 --> 09:21.300
you know, maybe see how
Said's weathering the storm.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.734
- Why, what do you care?

09:22.800 --> 09:25.367
- I'm kind of
floundering here.

09:25.433 --> 09:26.567
- Floundering?

09:26.633 --> 09:29.033
- I mean, old mojo,
you know, I mean,

09:29.100 --> 09:33.400
it ain't treating ol' Omar
so--so great these days.

09:35.133 --> 09:41.000
Without...
Without Said...

09:41.066 --> 09:44.266
Everything's just
kind of harder.

09:46.567 --> 09:51.667
I mean, I really need that fuck.
Who knew?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.533
- Come on.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.533
You're going back
to Em City.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.700
- What if I refuse?

10:11.767 --> 10:13.300
- You'd be the first person
who did.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.700
- I'm not ready to leave.
I don't deserve to.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.600
- You know, Omar told me
what happened and why.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.166
- Why...

10:22.233 --> 10:25.667
And yet again, I--
I lost my humanity

10:25.734 --> 10:30.400
in pursuit of what I thought
was the greater good.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.934
- You know, Said,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.066
I don't think that you
lost your humanity at all.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.934
I think what scares you
is that your actions

10:40.000 --> 10:41.700
are completely human.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.133
Let's go.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.166
- McManus, either I find
my soul in this place,

10:46.233 --> 10:48.433
or I am lost forever.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.533
I need more time.
I need more time, please?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.100
Please?

10:54.166 --> 10:56.600
- Man, this is crazy.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.767
All right.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.367
I'll wait
to hear from you.

11:10.633 --> 11:13.533
And then you're
back in Em City

11:13.600 --> 11:15.500
dancing
with Omar White.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.300
- What kind of people
become fortune tellers?

11:43.367 --> 11:45.233
Most times, they're
a bunch of half-literate,

11:45.300 --> 11:47.333
middle-aged women
who only tell you stuff

11:47.400 --> 11:48.967
they wish would
happen to them.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.567
They fabricate
your dreams,

11:50.633 --> 11:54.000
because theirs got
dashed on the rocks.

11:54.066 --> 11:56.266
So, how you
figure dat, huh?

11:56.333 --> 11:59.567
Having your
future told...

12:01.900 --> 12:04.300
By someone
who ain't got one?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.600
- Doctor, what the fuck
is wrong with me?

12:07.667 --> 12:09.767
I'm hot,
I've got rashes,

12:09.834 --> 12:11.300
diarrhea.

12:11.367 --> 12:14.066
- Well, I'm afraid
what you have is--

12:14.133 --> 12:16.600
it's called
a staph infection.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.400
Sometimes when
a wound gets infected,

12:18.467 --> 12:21.033
toxins are released
into the bloodstream,

12:21.100 --> 12:22.867
and these toxins
tunnel into tissue and--

12:22.934 --> 12:24.266
- That's why
all the drugs?

12:24.333 --> 12:25.934
- Well, antibiotics, yes.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.934
But your system seems
to be resistant to them.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.133
- And I got this from
being in the hospital?

12:30.200 --> 12:33.000
- Yeah.

12:33.066 --> 12:35.734
- Am I gonna die?

12:35.800 --> 12:38.667
- Look, we're doing
everything we can, all right?

12:38.734 --> 12:40.400
I'm sure that...

12:40.467 --> 12:42.934
- Oh, Christ,
don't let me die.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.533
I don't
want to die.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.133
I don't want to die
lying in my own shit.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.734
- Oh, man,
oh, man,

12:50.800 --> 12:53.166
I'm getting hard just
looking at that beauty.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.700
- Rack 'em, prag.

12:55.767 --> 12:58.033
- So, I hear Pancamo caught
the flu or something.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.367
It may be fatal.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.667
- Good.

13:00.734 --> 13:02.633
If it isn't,
when he gets out,

13:02.700 --> 13:04.100
we'll make it fatal.

13:04.166 --> 13:06.533
- Schibetta's in the psych unit,
Urbano's in the hole,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.900
and the Sicilians don't run
the cafeteria anymore.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.800
Those wise guys ain't looking
that wise these days.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.600
- Meanwhile, we got
other fish to fry.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.934
You know, sweat pea,
I like a nice, firm ass.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.967
You need to
go to the gym.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.734
- Yes, sir.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.333
- And if you see your buddy
Adam Guenzel there,

13:29.400 --> 13:33.533
I need you to give him
some pertinent information.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.567
- About what, sir?

13:35.633 --> 13:38.700
- About his buddy,
Tobias Beecher.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.233
- How was your visit
with your mother and dad?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.667
- She cried
the whole time.

13:44.734 --> 13:45.800
It was embarrassing.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.633
- Well, you should
be grateful

13:47.700 --> 13:49.000
somebody's crying
about you at all.

13:50.467 --> 13:51.900
- Okay,
that's enough.

13:51.967 --> 13:53.567
Stop.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.033
Come on, stop.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.800
- Oh, cut it out.
- Come on.

13:57.867 --> 13:59.066
- I'm gonna go
use the free weights.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.033
- Oh, I got to get you
back to Em City

14:01.100 --> 14:02.100
before I go to work
for Sister Pete.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.533
- I can get back
to Em City myself.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.934
- Yeah, but...

14:05.000 --> 14:07.300
- Look, I gotta start
being my own man.

14:07.367 --> 14:11.500
- Ah, okay.

14:17.934 --> 14:19.233
- Hey there,
handsome.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.934
- Fuck you.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.700
- Hey, what's with
the attitude, man?

14:22.767 --> 14:25.300
Hey, pal, I'm in here
because of you, remember?

14:25.367 --> 14:27.033
I didn't want
to rape that girl.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.066
- Look at yourself,
look at what you've turned into.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.100
- I had to,
to survive, you know?

14:31.166 --> 14:32.633
- You don't see me
all dolled up.

14:32.700 --> 14:33.834
- That's because
you've got Beecher.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.300
And from
what I understand,

14:35.367 --> 14:36.500
you're paying the same price
for protection that I am.

14:36.567 --> 14:37.967
- Bullshit!

14:38.033 --> 14:39.300
- Oh, come on, everybody knows
Beecher's a fucking fag.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.266
And everybody knows that
you're sucking his cock.

14:41.333 --> 14:42.734
- What?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.600
What'd you say,
you stupid fuck?

14:44.667 --> 14:46.500
Come on, fuck!

14:47.567 --> 14:49.367
You fucking bitch!

14:49.433 --> 14:50.700
- Fucking psycho!

14:50.767 --> 14:52.734
- You want to tell me
what that was all about?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.266
- Winthrop
came on to me.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.533
I had to
set him straight.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.934
- I thought you two
were friends.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.333
- Not anymore.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.633
- All right, since this
is your first offense,

15:00.700 --> 15:02.100
I'm gonna be lenient,

15:02.166 --> 15:04.533
but you only get one hall pass,
you understand?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.967
- Yes, sir.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.867
- So, he slapped you
on the wrist?

15:11.934 --> 15:13.266
- Just like
you said he would.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.300
- You don't want to spend
any time in the hole, Adam.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.500
- I already got my lecture
for the day, okay?

15:17.567 --> 15:19.200
- Hey, are you all right?

15:19.266 --> 15:21.133
- Don't be fucking
touching me!

15:22.433 --> 15:25.633
- I want to say something
about our last session,

15:25.700 --> 15:29.567
when we were
discussing homosexuality.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.200
At the time,

15:32.266 --> 15:36.433
I implied that I've never
harmed you, Beecher.

15:37.667 --> 15:43.934
Well, my reaction
was knee-jerk.

15:45.033 --> 15:46.900
You have to understand,

15:46.967 --> 15:49.567
I was worried about
saying anything out loud

15:49.633 --> 15:51.834
that might expose me

15:51.900 --> 15:54.567
to possible disciplinary

15:54.633 --> 15:56.867
or legal action.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.767
I did abuse you
when you arrived.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.767
And for that,
I am sorry.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.734
I ask your forgiveness.

16:18.567 --> 16:22.633
- Tobias...

16:22.700 --> 16:24.600
Do you accept
his apology?

16:27.467 --> 16:31.467
- I...

16:32.533 --> 16:35.100
I don't know.

16:35.166 --> 16:38.200
- So, the FBI has decided to let
the local D.A. prosecute you.

16:38.266 --> 16:41.133
- Why?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.700
- The eyewitness
that came forward

16:42.767 --> 16:44.967
claims to have seen you
dump Brice Tibbetts' body

16:45.033 --> 16:46.767
in a field outside
of Alden Township.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.800
But the FBI only has
jurisdiction if they can prove

16:49.867 --> 16:51.467
that you brought Tibbetts
across the state line,

16:51.533 --> 16:53.533
which they can't.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.433
- Let's say that
I did dump the body.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.066
It doesn't mean that
I killed the guy.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.467
- Exactly.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.900
See, now if I'm gonna
keep you off death row,

17:00.967 --> 17:03.100
we'll have to create
that doubt in the jury's mind,

17:03.166 --> 17:06.667
but you said
you didn't kill Tibbetts.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.367
- That's right.

17:08.433 --> 17:09.633
- Then what were you doing
with the body?

17:09.700 --> 17:11.166
- It wasn't me.

17:11.233 --> 17:12.533
- Okay, 'cause
the eyewitness,

17:12.600 --> 17:14.667
he picked you
out of a lineup, so...

17:18.400 --> 17:20.734
- Catherine,
it wasn't me.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.266
Now this witness says that it
was nighttime, right?

17:23.333 --> 17:24.900
There's no lights
at nighttime, right?

17:24.967 --> 17:27.834
All of a sudden, this
motherfucker's got x-ray vision?

17:27.900 --> 17:31.033
- Well, jeez, Keller,
you don't need me.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.266
See, you can just
plead your own case.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.633
- You're prettier.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.667
- Not by much.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.834
The arraignment's
tomorrow.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.600
- Mm-hmm.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.300
- Ready for a little trip
into town?

17:46.367 --> 17:47.600
- What, and leave
this place?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.367
Jesus,
I don't know.

17:50.767 --> 17:51.867
- Officer?

17:52.867 --> 17:55.266
Till the A.M.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.533
- You going
to see Toby?

17:58.600 --> 18:00.934
- Yes.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.900
- Tell him I had
a funny dream about him.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.600
He was elected president
of the United States.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.367
- I had a dream
about you and me.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.633
- Yeah?

18:27.700 --> 18:29.467
- We were gladiators.

18:29.533 --> 18:32.700
Your name
was Sextus.

18:32.767 --> 18:35.734
Mine was Cunnilinga.

18:38.533 --> 18:41.266
- God, it is
good to see you.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.700
Yes, you too.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.400
- Oh, I spoke
to Holly this morning,

18:46.467 --> 18:48.333
and she said she had
such a great time

18:48.400 --> 18:50.934
at Adventure Country
with you and your son Brad.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.600
- She's a wonderful kid.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.367
- How'd your meeting
go with Keller?

18:56.433 --> 18:58.433
- Good.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.900
Good.

18:59.967 --> 19:02.667
We're well on our way
to building a solid defense.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.934
Toby, he never talked
about these killings, did he?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.967
- No.

19:13.567 --> 19:16.467
- You wouldn't lie to me
in order to protect him?

19:16.533 --> 19:17.867
- No.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.667
- Okay.

19:21.734 --> 19:24.967
I'll see you.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.867
- Oh, Catherine,
Keller--

19:31.934 --> 19:34.734
he didn't give you
a message for me, did he?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.867
- No.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.533
- So, there's two ways
this could go, precious.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.834
They both end the same,
with my dick up your ass.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.867
- Beecher, I need
to talk to you.

19:53.934 --> 19:55.367
- Look...

19:55.433 --> 19:57.433
- I didn't want to say anything
in our session,

19:57.500 --> 20:01.867
I tried to convince Robson
not to rape your boy Guenzel.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.166
But you know--you know Robson;
he's headstrong.

20:04.233 --> 20:08.066
Anyway, the Sicilians
stopped him and I'm glad.

20:08.734 --> 20:10.767
- You're glad?

20:10.834 --> 20:12.934
- Yeah, well,
not glad, exactly.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.233
I'm like you.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.433
I'm all turned around,
you know.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.166
I'm trying to stop
the shit in my life,

20:20.233 --> 20:24.867
but it's Oz,
you know?

20:24.934 --> 20:27.200
I realize I can't
stop most of it,

20:27.266 --> 20:29.033
but I can do
some things.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.500
Now, I heard
what's going on.

20:31.567 --> 20:34.700
The warden won't
let you see Keller.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.333
So, I'm offering
on my next mail run

20:37.400 --> 20:40.300
to take a letter
to Keller for you.

20:41.934 --> 20:44.200
- You'd do that?

20:44.266 --> 20:46.133
You would?

20:46.200 --> 20:49.133
- You write it up,
I'll slip it through.

20:49.967 --> 20:52.567
- I'm, uh...

20:52.633 --> 20:54.633
- What?
Amazed, in shock?

20:56.433 --> 20:58.900
- Suspicious.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.166
- Well, you have
every right to be.

21:01.233 --> 21:03.734
But I swear to you,

21:03.800 --> 21:07.133
on the graves
of both of my sons,

21:07.200 --> 21:11.000
I'm just trying
to make up for the past.

21:11.633 --> 21:16.934
Trying to clear my conscience
so I can move on.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.533
Hello there, Keller.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.433
- Schillinger,
my old friend.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.900
- I got a package
from one of your ex-wives,

21:35.967 --> 21:41.433
subscription renewal notice
from "Sports Illustrated,"

21:41.500 --> 21:44.100
and this,
from Beecher.

21:51.567 --> 21:52.500
- What's the game?

21:52.567 --> 21:54.433
- No game.

21:59.900 --> 22:00.967
Tomorrow,
if you want,

22:01.033 --> 22:02.800
I'll take your letter
back to Beecher.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.567
- Lights out!

22:22.734 --> 22:27.200
- Adam, is everything
all right?

22:27.266 --> 22:29.367
You haven't said
a word all evening.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.166
- Were you a fag
before you came to oz,

22:32.233 --> 22:34.367
or did you
start here?

22:34.433 --> 22:36.533
- What?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.133
- I've been
asking around.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.367
I heard some stories.
Are they true?

22:39.433 --> 22:41.900
- It depends on
what you heard.

22:41.967 --> 22:45.400
- That when you first arrived
you were Schillinger's bitch.

22:46.467 --> 22:47.667
- Yes.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.000
- Then some guy
named Keller's bitch?

22:50.066 --> 22:52.667
- Not a bitch,
exactly.

22:52.734 --> 22:55.100
- Then what,
his girlfriend?

22:55.166 --> 23:00.967
- People like to reduce things
to their most basic form.

23:01.033 --> 23:03.066
- You're either a fag
or you're not a fag.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.367
And if you are,
you should have told me

23:05.433 --> 23:07.000
instead of pretending
to act normal,

23:07.066 --> 23:09.100
pretending to care about me
for the right reasons.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.200
- Adam, I do care about you
for the right reasons.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.367
- Stay back!
- Come on, don't be an asshole.

23:14.433 --> 23:15.467
- Oh, you'd
like that, huh?

23:15.533 --> 23:16.567
To be up
my asshole?

23:16.633 --> 23:17.700
- Shut the fuck up!

23:18.967 --> 23:21.000
- Get the fuck off me,
you fucking faggot!

23:21.066 --> 23:22.433
- Just stop.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.500
- Get the fuck off me!

23:24.567 --> 23:25.800
- Break it up!

23:25.867 --> 23:27.367
- I don't need
that fucking faggot!

23:27.433 --> 23:29.200
I'm telling you,
this faggot grabbed me.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.266
I don't want to spend another
night in the same cell as him.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.633
- Fine.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.567
But since all the cells
in Em City are full,

23:34.633 --> 23:36.834
and since you need
a little attitude adjustment,

23:36.900 --> 23:38.533
I'm putting you
in the cage.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.767
- Me?
I didn't do shit!

23:39.834 --> 23:41.900
Get your fucking hands
off me, you fuck!

23:41.967 --> 23:43.700
- The boy's
got problems.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.700
He raped a girl,
beat her brains in.

23:45.767 --> 23:46.867
- I know.

23:46.934 --> 23:50.600
I've known Adam's family
for a long time.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.934
- Yeah, I know, that's why
I made you his sponsor.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.266
But I'm beginning to think
I made a mistake

23:55.333 --> 23:56.467
bringing him
to Em City.

23:56.533 --> 23:57.967
Maybe I should
transfer him out.

23:58.033 --> 23:59.066
- Don't.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.300
I can turn him around.

24:01.367 --> 24:03.000
Give me a chance.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.500
- Okay, a chance.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.333
- Faggot.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.233
Faggot.
Faggot.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.233
Faggot.
Faggot!

24:23.300 --> 24:24.867
Faggot!

24:24.934 --> 24:29.000
Faggot!
Faggot!

24:29.066 --> 24:30.900
Faggot!

24:30.967 --> 24:32.266
Faggot!

24:32.333 --> 24:34.400
Faggot!

24:34.467 --> 24:35.800
Faggot!

24:35.867 --> 24:38.066
Faggot!

24:38.133 --> 24:39.133
Faggot!

24:39.200 --> 24:40.600
Faggot!

24:40.667 --> 24:42.166
Faggot!

24:42.233 --> 24:44.233
- I found a way for you and
Keller to meet face to face.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.433
- Yeah? How?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.133
- Come work for me
in the post office.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.467
I'll let you deliver the mail
to protective custody.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.467
- Quit Sister Pete?

24:52.533 --> 24:54.934
- Well, yeah,
you'd have to.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.400
- And I'd get
to see Keller?

24:56.467 --> 24:57.667
- Every day.

24:57.734 --> 24:59.066
- Okay.

24:59.133 --> 25:02.367
- There's just one thing
that I'd ask for in trade.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.000
- What's that?

25:04.066 --> 25:05.467
- The boy.

25:05.533 --> 25:06.900
Give me the boy.

25:07.467 --> 25:09.367
- What?

25:09.433 --> 25:11.800
- Tell the Sicilians to back off
and let me have him,

25:11.867 --> 25:13.667
to do with
whatever I choose.

25:13.734 --> 25:18.100
- This is what this
has all been about?

25:18.166 --> 25:19.633
- What do you mean?

25:19.700 --> 25:21.400
- The "I'm trying
to change my ways" crap.

25:21.467 --> 25:24.200
You know, it--

25:24.266 --> 25:25.967
I almost
believed you.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.400
- Oh, it's true.

25:27.467 --> 25:30.200
But really,
it's beside the point.

25:30.266 --> 25:31.900
I have a practical solution
to your problem.

25:31.967 --> 25:35.066
- You're asking me to get
the thing I want most

25:35.133 --> 25:36.667
to allow you
to subject Adam

25:36.734 --> 25:38.367
to the same horrors
you put me through?

25:38.433 --> 25:39.900
No way.

25:39.967 --> 25:42.200
- Hmph, not even
for Keller?

25:42.266 --> 25:43.533
- Not even for Keller.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.200
- Well, I have to admit,
I'm stunned.

25:47.266 --> 25:48.500
I admire your strength
of character.

25:48.567 --> 25:50.734
I respect
your decision.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.667
We'll just leave
the whole matter at that.

25:52.734 --> 25:54.066
- Yeah, you never
leave anything at that.

25:54.133 --> 25:59.700
- Well, nobody
changes overnight.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.834
Be sure to eat
your vegetables.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.533
- Who's to say
that the future

26:07.600 --> 26:09.800
ain't fucking with
the fortune teller?

26:11.033 --> 26:15.767
Let's say that she tells you
you're gonna fall in love.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.633
But she
doesn't tell you

26:17.700 --> 26:19.667
that your beloved's
gonna die of cancer,

26:19.734 --> 26:22.100
and  that she really
is your long-lost sister,

26:22.166 --> 26:24.166
and  a serial killer.

26:24.233 --> 26:26.233
Because the fortune teller
don't know that.

26:26.300 --> 26:30.333
What if God or the spirits
or whatever

26:30.400 --> 26:34.667
is only telling the fortune
teller half the story,

26:35.467 --> 26:37.266
half the truth?

26:39.000 --> 26:41.100
- Fucking Friday.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.433
- Fucking Friday?

26:42.500 --> 26:43.867
- Yeah, you'd think
I'd be happy

26:43.934 --> 26:45.467
with the weekend
coming, and all.

26:45.533 --> 26:49.967
Working in Oz, I never feel
more fucked than on a Friday.

26:50.033 --> 26:51.300
- Hmm, payday.

26:51.367 --> 26:54.934
- I don't know
if I'd call it pay.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.533
Man makes
a dog-shit wage.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.200
Money none of those cocksucking
congressmen would work for, huh?

26:59.266 --> 27:01.800
Hey, you
got to laugh.

27:01.867 --> 27:03.567
- You follow
pro basketball?

27:03.633 --> 27:04.633
- Huh, basketball?

27:04.700 --> 27:06.400
- Yeah.

27:06.467 --> 27:07.934
Who do you think
the worst player in the NBA is?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.433
- Some white guy.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.066
- Actually, maybe
two or three white guys

27:12.133 --> 27:13.567
battling
for the honor.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.333
- Yeah, that's gotta
piss you off, right?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.600
Seeing some of
these jags play pro ball

27:17.667 --> 27:19.300
knowing you're better
than most of them?

27:19.367 --> 27:20.567
- Why would that
piss me off?

27:20.633 --> 27:22.166
You know how goddamn good
you've gotta be

27:22.233 --> 27:23.967
in order to be
the worst player in the NBA?

27:24.033 --> 27:25.300
You gotta
be phenomenal.

27:25.367 --> 27:27.300
- No, I realize that,
I was just saying--

27:27.367 --> 27:29.533
- My point was that even
the worst player in the NBA

27:29.600 --> 27:32.767
still makes league minimum,
$330,000 a year.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.100
- Wow.

27:34.166 --> 27:36.033
- You take away
what the government gets,

27:36.100 --> 27:37.300
your agent's
four percent.

27:37.367 --> 27:39.633
Worst case scenario,
you've still got 160.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.500
Fuck it, 150,
even 140.

27:42.567 --> 27:45.200
Say you want to jerk off
with 10 of it.

27:45.266 --> 27:48.567
That's $140,000 cash,
in pocket!

27:48.633 --> 27:51.967
- Hey Dave, man, I didn't mean
to get you all riled up.

27:52.033 --> 27:54.734
- It's not you.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.567
It's fucking Friday.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.533
- So, all the blood tests
came back negative.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.767
We should run them again
in three months.

28:00.834 --> 28:02.367
- And Martinez,
how are his blood tests?

28:02.433 --> 28:04.867
- Oh, he doesn't have AIDS,
if that's what you're asking.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.600
That doesn't
necessarily mean

28:07.667 --> 28:09.100
it was his blood
that got thrown at you.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.700
- Why'd you douse me,
you prick?

28:13.767 --> 28:15.033
- Because you're the prick,
you prick.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.166
- Hey, stop that!

28:17.233 --> 28:19.500
- Oh, okay, so it's okay for you
to hit this cocksucker,

28:19.567 --> 28:21.500
but not me?

28:25.133 --> 28:26.567
- Officer Brass?

28:26.633 --> 28:27.767
Officer Brass?

28:27.834 --> 28:29.467
- What?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.033
- Do you buy
my Mightyball ticket?

28:31.100 --> 28:34.166
- What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:35.567 --> 28:37.934
- It's almost time.
I'm so excited.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.166
Aren't you
excited, Bob?

28:39.233 --> 28:40.667
- Excited about what?

28:40.734 --> 28:43.300
- The Mightyball drawing,
$2 million, which if you win

28:43.367 --> 28:44.900
will go towards finding a cure
for your grandson.

28:44.967 --> 28:46.300
How can you not
be excited?

28:46.367 --> 28:48.100
- What if God didn't give me
the right numbers?

28:48.166 --> 28:51.767
What if
I don't win?

28:53.800 --> 28:55.867
Then little Alex dies.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.967
- Today's numbers
will be randomly selected

29:02.033 --> 29:06.166
from 51 numbered balls
out of our lotto draw hopper.

29:06.233 --> 29:09.600
So, everybody,
get it out and get it ready,

29:09.667 --> 29:12.367
'cause it's time
to play Mightyball.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.367
If your number
is drawn,

29:18.433 --> 29:21.266
you could be the lucky winner
of $2 million.

29:21.333 --> 29:24.467
The first number is...

29:24.533 --> 29:25.600
Seven.

29:25.667 --> 29:28.400
- Seven, Bob,
that's a match.

29:30.533 --> 29:34.066
- The second number
is 10.

29:34.133 --> 29:37.066
- That's two.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.533
- Three.

29:43.734 --> 29:48.734
- The fourth number is...

29:48.800 --> 29:51.934
49.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.734
- Four for four.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.066
- The fifth number is...

29:57.133 --> 30:00.100
30.

30:00.667 --> 30:02.800
And the final number,

30:02.867 --> 30:06.133
and the winner of
$2 million is...

30:07.934 --> 30:09.633
51.

30:16.333 --> 30:20.133
- Motherfucker, you've gotta
be fucking fucking me.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.333
Yes!

30:21.400 --> 30:23.333
Jesus Christ,
I fucking won!

30:23.400 --> 30:25.333
Yeah!
- You won?

30:25.400 --> 30:27.266
- Yeah, motherfucker,
I won!

30:27.333 --> 30:29.200
Goddamnit, yes!

30:29.266 --> 30:31.867
Oh, shit!
Fuck!

30:33.800 --> 30:36.133
Oh, yeah!
Shit!

30:38.567 --> 30:40.700
Shit!
Fuck!

30:40.767 --> 30:42.900
Goddamn, fuck, fuck, fuck!

30:42.967 --> 30:45.367
Yeah!

31:02.600 --> 31:03.734
- I know,
it's wild.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.467
Yeah, all right,
all right.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.867
Okay, okay, bye.
Yeah.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.734
Yeah.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.633
- Rebadow's been making
a fuss all day.

31:13.700 --> 31:17.200
He claims that Brass
didn't win the lottery; he did.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.400
- Oh, yeah?

31:18.467 --> 31:21.767
All right, um, well,
bring him in.

31:24.867 --> 31:27.467
- Bob, I need to speak
with Officer Brass.

31:27.533 --> 31:28.467
I've been waiting.

31:28.533 --> 31:29.467
- Slow down,
slow down.

31:29.533 --> 31:31.500
- 7, 10, 3, 49, 30, 51,

31:31.567 --> 31:32.934
those are my numbers.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.967
I had Officer Brass
purchase the ticket for me.

31:35.033 --> 31:39.133
- Bob, uh, memorizing the
winning numbers doesn't prove--

31:39.200 --> 31:41.767
- You don't believe me?
Ask Officer Brass.

31:41.834 --> 31:44.667
- Are you serious?

31:44.734 --> 31:47.066
- On my dying
grandson's life.

31:47.133 --> 31:49.367
- Well, Bob,
Dave Brass isn't here.

31:49.433 --> 31:51.100
I mean, when he found out
he won, he just left.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.700
He didn't go
to his locker.

31:52.767 --> 31:55.066
He didn't...
He didn't punch out.

31:55.133 --> 31:57.633
- Can't you
find him somehow?

31:59.533 --> 32:02.133
- Let me see
what I can do.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.400
- You walk
by a storefront.

32:05.467 --> 32:08.000
A fortune teller
beckons you inside.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.567
You know it's a scam,
but you go anyway.

32:10.633 --> 32:12.734
As she flips the cards,

32:12.800 --> 32:14.734
you say to yourself,
"This is bullshit."

32:14.800 --> 32:20.100
And yet, she says the one thing
you really want to hear.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.633
You lean in
a little closer,

32:21.700 --> 32:25.300
hoping, praying that
she actually knows the truth.

32:25.367 --> 32:26.800
- Well, I came
straight from work.

32:26.867 --> 32:31.100
I'm a C.O. at the Oswald
Correctional Facility.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.166
Well, not anymore.

32:32.233 --> 32:33.800
I quit!

32:33.867 --> 32:36.767
Whoo!

32:36.834 --> 32:38.700
I won!
Whoo!

32:44.100 --> 32:46.767
- Tim, any word
from Brass?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.700
- No, nobody's
heard from him.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.200
Not his family,
not his girlfriend.

32:50.266 --> 32:52.200
He left the lottery
claims center

32:52.266 --> 32:54.834
and hopped a plane
to parts unknown.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.266
- Damn.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.734
I was with Brass
during the drawing.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.667
He was out of his mind
because he won,

33:01.734 --> 33:02.734
you know,
as you would be.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.333
But thinking
about it now,

33:04.400 --> 33:06.800
he must have been saying
to himself, "Fuck you, Rebadow."

33:06.867 --> 33:08.767
And I'll tell you,

33:08.834 --> 33:10.567
if it was one of
the other dinks in this joint

33:10.633 --> 33:13.500
and I was Brass,
I would've ripped them off, too,

33:13.567 --> 33:15.400
but to do it
to a guy like Rebadow,

33:15.467 --> 33:17.800
you know, he's got a dying
grandson, not throw him a bone.

33:17.867 --> 33:19.734
I mean, that's
dead-of-winter cold.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.333
- Brass was a good guy.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.133
- Obviously not
that good of a guy.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.867
- When we played basketball
against Vahue,

33:24.934 --> 33:26.767
I got
to know him.

33:26.834 --> 33:30.000
He was the most stand-up,
do-right-by-you person

33:30.066 --> 33:31.467
I ever met.

33:31.533 --> 33:34.400
- Well, guess that's what
two mil can do to a fellow.

33:34.467 --> 33:35.967
- No, it wasn't the money;
he felt fucked over.

33:36.033 --> 33:38.800
I mean, he had
a big pair of gigantic,

33:38.867 --> 33:41.266
NBA tits in his face
and we say to him,

33:41.333 --> 33:42.400
no, no, no, no,
you work in Oz.

33:42.467 --> 33:43.500
You get to get
your Achilles tendon

33:43.567 --> 33:44.934
slashed for no good reason

33:45.000 --> 33:47.767
except McManus can't
keep his fucking mouth shut.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.433
- You gonna blame yourself for
what happened to Brass forever?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.200
- Yeah.

33:52.266 --> 33:55.066
- Dave Brass came to Oz
and filled out an application.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.600
Nobody forced him
to do that, right?

33:57.667 --> 33:59.033
He got his leg fucked up.
That sucks.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.834
But this is
a maximum security prison.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.834
The poor guy got piss
and shit thrown at him.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.300
He could get AIDS.

34:06.367 --> 34:08.500
That'd be a lot worse
than being a goddamned gimp.

34:08.567 --> 34:09.934
But you know what?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.266
He filled out
an application.

34:13.333 --> 34:17.867
Tim, every night I get down
on my knees and pray to God

34:17.934 --> 34:19.934
I don't get shanked
when I come to work.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.266
But what if
it happens?

34:21.333 --> 34:22.834
I mean, what if one
of these fucking animals

34:22.900 --> 34:24.467
ends up
butt-fucking me?

34:24.533 --> 34:26.800
Are you gonna blame yourself
because you brought me into Oz?

34:26.867 --> 34:29.767
Because if you did,
you'd be a goddamed idiot.

34:29.834 --> 34:32.367
I filled out
an application.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.600
- Cold out there,
ain't it?

34:45.667 --> 34:47.300
- Oh, you're telling me.

34:47.367 --> 34:50.767
I wish I had a fur coat like
one of your seeing eye dogs.

34:50.834 --> 34:52.633
- Well, we prefer
to call them guide dogs.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.433
- Well, what's
the difference?

34:54.500 --> 34:56.400
- Well, you work
for the governor.

34:56.467 --> 34:59.166
You should know what it's like
being politically correct.

34:59.233 --> 35:02.133
How's the program going?

35:02.200 --> 35:05.100
- Well, it's a real testament
to man's best friend.

35:05.166 --> 35:07.900
I have three of
the more disparate inmates

35:07.967 --> 35:09.333
that I've ever had,

35:09.400 --> 35:11.233
and each of them
are doing a wonderful job.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.800
- I'm  impressed.

35:13.867 --> 35:15.700
- Most skeptics
usually are.

35:15.767 --> 35:17.200
- Oh.
- Catch you later.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.467
- Hey, Lela.

35:39.533 --> 35:44.133
It's hot in here
this morning.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.433
Hey, Lela.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.934
Le--Le--

35:56.900 --> 35:59.367
- He's got septicemia,
a serious kidney disease.

35:59.433 --> 36:01.033
He went
into septic shock.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.033
We managed to bring
his temperature down from 105.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.433
- This is, like, what?
A virus?

36:05.500 --> 36:06.600
I-is it contagious?

36:06.667 --> 36:08.133
- No, it's
a bacterial infection.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.867
Oftentimes, paraplegics
are prone to kidney disorders,

36:10.934 --> 36:13.266
especially if they take
poor care of themselves.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.467
- Wait, wait, Augustus is nearly
maniacal about his upkeep.

36:16.533 --> 36:19.200
- There's something else.
- What?

36:19.266 --> 36:23.533
- He's also got a shitload
of heroin in his bloodstream.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.533
- Up, down, back, up!

36:29.600 --> 36:32.633
- Whoa, what the fuck
is this, man?

36:32.700 --> 36:35.233
- Miss Sally's
new TV series, "Sallycise".

36:35.300 --> 36:36.934
It's a health
and exercise show.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.266
- Yeah, well, one of my muscles
is already getting bigger.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.767
- What's
the latest on Hill?

36:40.834 --> 36:42.233
- Is Augustus
gonna be okay?

36:42.300 --> 36:43.967
- Yo, what's up?
Did he O.D., McManus?

36:44.033 --> 36:46.800
- McManus, how's Augustus?

36:46.867 --> 36:48.066
- So, how's he doing?

36:48.133 --> 36:49.867
- You son of a bitch.

36:49.934 --> 36:52.500
Augustus' blood
is swimming in heroin, huh?

36:52.567 --> 36:54.266
You want to fucking
tell me about that, do you?

36:54.333 --> 36:55.633
- I don't know
nothing about that!

36:55.700 --> 36:57.066
Just tell me
how the fuck he is!

36:57.133 --> 36:58.433
- He's dying.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.834
He's lying in
a fucking hospital bed dying.

37:00.900 --> 37:01.900
- Well, why in the hell
are you standing here

37:01.967 --> 37:03.367
trying to talk to me?

37:03.433 --> 37:04.767
- I want to know who gave him
the drugs, Redding.

37:04.834 --> 37:06.333
- I don't know
nothing about that.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.367
I swear to you,
you gotta believe me.

37:08.433 --> 37:09.567
- Why the fuck
should I believe you?

37:09.633 --> 37:10.633
- I'm getting old!

37:10.700 --> 37:12.767
I should've died
a long time ago.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.133
But there's one thing
I won't do,

37:14.200 --> 37:15.700
and that's outlive
that boy.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.633
Now you go and do
everything you can for him,

37:17.700 --> 37:19.433
and I swear to you,

37:19.500 --> 37:22.767
I'll find out who it was
that gave him that smack!

37:23.834 --> 37:26.166
- All right, and when you do,
you bring him straight to me.

37:26.233 --> 37:27.367
You understand me?

37:34.533 --> 37:36.700
- Yo, Burr,
how's our boy doing?

37:36.767 --> 37:38.266
- You been
feeding him tits?

37:38.333 --> 37:39.967
- Why, he overdosed
or something?

37:40.033 --> 37:41.500
I thought it was
a kidney thing.

37:41.567 --> 37:44.500
- Brought on by some
motherfucker that got him smack.

37:44.567 --> 37:46.266
And you're at the top
of my list, poet!

37:46.333 --> 37:48.467
- What, me?
No way, man.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.033
No way!

37:50.100 --> 37:54.367
- I swear to you,
I will root out the truth.

37:54.433 --> 37:56.300
- You keeping digging,
motherfucker,

37:56.367 --> 37:58.200
but I ain't
give him shit.

37:58.266 --> 37:59.633
You know, you got
a lot of enemies, Burr.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.633
Before you start
accusing your friends,

38:01.700 --> 38:05.300
you need to go check out
them Sicilians and them Spics.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.400
That's what
you need to do.

38:43.433 --> 38:46.633
- Prisoner number
97P528,

38:46.700 --> 38:48.000
Greg Penders,

38:48.066 --> 38:50.967
convicted May 7th, 1997,

38:51.033 --> 38:53.066
criminally negligent homicide.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.567
Sentence: 17 years.

38:55.633 --> 38:58.433
Up for parole
in nine.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.000
- You heard the news?
- Yeah, too bad.

39:02.066 --> 39:03.934
Augustus was doing
a great job with Lela.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.934
- Well, what are
the steaks for?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.266
- They're for
today's training.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.767
- We're gonna teach
the dogs to cook?

39:10.834 --> 39:13.133
- You're gonna teach
the dogs self-control.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.066
Now, it's of primary importance
that your dog's attention

39:16.133 --> 39:19.100
at all times
remains focused on you,

39:19.166 --> 39:21.600
even when tempted
with those things that,

39:21.667 --> 39:23.700
as a dog,
they love.

39:23.767 --> 39:25.066
- Like raw
fucking meat.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.934
- Or cats or other dogs,
anything.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.467
So, the two of you
head on over there.

39:41.033 --> 39:42.467
- This is fucking
unbelievable.

39:42.533 --> 39:44.166
You know, I haven't seen
a steak in six years,

39:44.233 --> 39:45.934
and now you're gonna
put it on the floor,

39:46.000 --> 39:47.233
so a dog
won't eat it?

39:47.300 --> 39:48.967
- Miguel,
you go first.

39:49.033 --> 39:51.467
Have Julie lead you along,
but towards the steak.

39:51.533 --> 39:53.934
- Yeah, but what do I do
if she goes for it?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.467
- You give her lead
a firm tug and say, "No."

39:57.500 --> 39:58.667
- No!

39:58.734 --> 40:00.567
Julie, no!

40:01.367 --> 40:04.400
Good girl,
good girl.

40:04.467 --> 40:05.800
Come on.

40:06.233 --> 40:08.600
Julie, no!

40:08.667 --> 40:10.266
Julie!

40:10.333 --> 40:11.633
No!

40:11.700 --> 40:13.000
Shit!

40:13.066 --> 40:15.133
This is gonna
take a while.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.166
- Cute pooch.

40:18.233 --> 40:20.834
You know, when I was nine
my parents gave me a dog,

40:20.900 --> 40:23.633
this beautiful
Chesapeake Bay retriever.

40:23.700 --> 40:25.700
One day I decided
to dock the dog's tail.

40:25.767 --> 40:27.567
- Dock,
what's that?

40:27.633 --> 40:28.834
- Amputate.

40:28.900 --> 40:29.900
- Why?

40:29.967 --> 40:31.467
- I just thought
he'd look better.

40:31.533 --> 40:33.233
I grabbed the butcher knife
from the kitchen

40:33.300 --> 40:34.834
and just
cut his tail off,

40:34.900 --> 40:37.266
cropped his ears,
kept on going.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.500
By the time
my folks got home,

40:38.567 --> 40:41.767
they were pissed,
dead puppy everywhere.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.900
- Get your hands off the dog.
- I'm kidding.

40:43.967 --> 40:46.800
- I don't care, get your hands
off my fucking dog.

40:46.867 --> 40:49.300
- Do what
he says, Jia.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.767
- Someday, Morales.

40:54.834 --> 40:56.133
Someday.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.467
- Are you
protecting me now?

41:00.533 --> 41:02.934
- No, I just hate
that yellow scum fuck,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.066
and I've got
a question to ask.

41:05.133 --> 41:08.467
You've been tight
with Mukada, right?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.934
- Yeah, on and off.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.967
- I was wondering something.
- What?

41:13.033 --> 41:14.467
- Where the fuck's
his office?

41:15.667 --> 41:17.200
- Open.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.467
Enrique...

41:22.533 --> 41:24.533
What a surprise.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.533
- Yeah,
you're telling me.

41:30.900 --> 41:33.400
Nice digs.

41:47.066 --> 41:48.800
- So?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.900
- I fried a guy once.

41:53.967 --> 41:55.266
That's why I'm here.

41:55.333 --> 41:58.100
I chucked his useless ass
into a transformer.

41:58.166 --> 42:00.300
Now, he begged me
not to kill him.

42:00.367 --> 42:04.900
I mean, that's what put me
over the edge, the begging.

42:04.967 --> 42:06.500
- So, now you're feeling
guilty about this.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.133
- Fuck, no.

42:08.200 --> 42:13.734
I'm thinking, I was the last guy
to hear this jag's voice.

42:13.800 --> 42:16.333
I own his last words.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.100
- I'm not following.

42:18.166 --> 42:20.200
- I got a feeling
you own my sister's,

42:20.266 --> 42:22.133
and I want them.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.834
- Oh, well, yes,
we did have a chat

42:23.900 --> 42:25.934
shortly before
the bus crashed.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.567
And she said that
she loves you very much,

42:27.633 --> 42:29.500
and that she was very
excited about seeing you.

42:29.567 --> 42:30.734
- And I couldn't
wait to see her.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.467
I mean,
her smiling face.

42:32.533 --> 42:34.734
She was the spitting image
of our mother.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.300
Now you gotta
tell me, Father,

42:36.367 --> 42:38.266
did Annette
at least die happy?

42:38.333 --> 42:41.100
- She seemed to be
in very good spirits,

42:41.166 --> 42:43.500
except for the problems that
she was having in her marriage.

42:43.567 --> 42:45.233
- Oh, wait,
she was having problems?

42:45.300 --> 42:46.734
- Yeah, you didn't
know about that?

42:46.800 --> 42:48.133
- No, what kind
of problems?

42:48.200 --> 42:52.834
- Well, I'm not sure
of the specifics.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.133
I...

42:54.200 --> 42:56.500
Maybe you better
ask her husband.

42:56.567 --> 42:58.200
- Yeah.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.066
Yeah, I'm gonna
do just that.

43:04.834 --> 43:06.900
- Goddamn, you look nicer in
here than you did out.

43:06.967 --> 43:08.266
- At least you still
look like shit.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.600
- It's been
a tough time,

43:09.667 --> 43:11.333
planning
the funeral and all.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.533
- Yeah.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.767
Well, how you doing
about Annette?

43:14.834 --> 43:16.700
- Okay, I guess.

43:16.767 --> 43:19.100
I mean,
me and her, we was--

43:19.166 --> 43:21.367
- Hey, hey, hey,
I know.

43:21.433 --> 43:22.800
She was a cunt.

43:24.433 --> 43:26.734
- Man, you don't know
how happy I am

43:26.800 --> 43:28.567
to hear you say that,
Enrique.

43:28.633 --> 43:30.166
I mean, I didn't want
to come down here

43:30.233 --> 43:31.500
and lie to you
about Annette.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.667
I mean,
all of a sudden

43:32.734 --> 43:34.166
she wanted to be
this model, right?

43:34.233 --> 43:35.834
She was walking
around South Beach

43:35.900 --> 43:37.467
and she's shoving
her tits in the face

43:37.533 --> 43:38.967
of every agent
and photographer in town.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.200
- If she was
spreading it around,

43:40.266 --> 43:41.367
you gotta set her straight.

43:41.433 --> 43:42.867
- She kept wearing
these skimpy tops

43:42.934 --> 43:45.233
no bigger than
fucking rubber bands.

43:46.233 --> 43:48.500
You know what I did?
- What?

43:48.567 --> 43:51.033
- I cut a fucking chunk
out of her arm.

43:51.100 --> 43:54.233
Believe me, the bitch
wore sleeves from then on.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.867
- That put her right?
- Fuck, no.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.367
The girl would spread her legs
for anything that moved,

43:58.433 --> 44:00.133
and sometimes
for things that didn't.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.900
I mean, I don't like to
disrespect the dead, Enrique--

44:01.967 --> 44:03.467
- Hey, you know what,
Javier?

44:03.533 --> 44:05.600
You never will again.

44:07.433 --> 44:10.500
My sister was a saint,
you motherfucker!

44:10.567 --> 44:12.133
Son of a bitch!

44:13.667 --> 44:14.834
Fucker!

44:14.900 --> 44:16.367
- Enough! Let him go!

44:16.433 --> 44:18.734
- You motherfucker!
- Let him go!

44:18.800 --> 44:20.433
- You cocksucker!

44:41.533 --> 44:42.734
- Father?

44:42.800 --> 44:44.433
F-father Mukada?

44:44.500 --> 44:46.834
Come here, please.

44:47.767 --> 44:48.700
- I heard that
you'd been transferred

44:48.767 --> 44:49.967
back from Benchley Memorial,

44:50.033 --> 44:51.633
that you'll recover
from the stabbing.

44:51.700 --> 44:53.500
- Where's Hoyt?

44:53.567 --> 44:54.867
- Hoyt confessed
to a series of murders.

44:54.934 --> 44:57.400
Today he's being
transported to death row.

44:57.467 --> 45:02.533
- Father, I want to make
confession as well.

45:04.233 --> 45:07.100
I want to be
a Roman Catholic again.

45:09.367 --> 45:11.467
- No.
- What?

45:11.533 --> 45:15.200
What do you--you--
you can't refuse me.

45:15.266 --> 45:17.600
- I sure as hell can.

45:18.633 --> 45:20.367
- Welcome
to death row, Hoyt.

45:28.533 --> 45:29.700
- In olden times,
when you wanted to know

45:29.767 --> 45:31.133
what the future held,

45:31.200 --> 45:33.166
you'd drag your lamb down
to the local witchy woman,

45:33.233 --> 45:35.867
where she'd proceed
to slice him neck to ass,

45:35.934 --> 45:38.066
and read his hot,
steamy entrails.

45:38.133 --> 45:40.767
From this, somehow,
your fortune was revealed,

45:40.834 --> 45:43.266
from some woman
with cataracts and no teeth,

45:43.333 --> 45:45.567
watching your
livestock bleed out.

45:45.633 --> 45:48.100
Seems to me,
all you've done is lost a lamb,

45:48.166 --> 45:51.266
which ain't gonna help
your fortune at all.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.600
- No!

45:53.667 --> 45:55.867
You fucking pig!

45:55.934 --> 45:58.033
No!

45:58.100 --> 46:01.533
No!

46:01.600 --> 46:03.633
- His violent episodes
are increasing.

46:03.700 --> 46:06.000
Every day now he's getting
into some kind of brawl.

46:06.066 --> 46:07.600
We can't just
keep sedating him.

46:07.667 --> 46:08.934
- Well, then get him
out of Solitary.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.533
It's making him go crazy.
Send him back to me.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.900
- Ryan, I've tried.
The warden refuses.

46:13.967 --> 46:15.800
- Why?

46:15.867 --> 46:17.767
- Ryan, your brother
killed Li Chen.

46:17.834 --> 46:20.233
- In self-defense.
He was gonna rape my ma.

46:20.300 --> 46:22.533
- But unfortunately,
you have no proof of that.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.767
And Jia denies ever
having said that to you.

46:24.834 --> 46:26.967
- Fucking chink bastard.
Because of that cocksucker,

46:27.033 --> 46:29.233
Cyril's facing
the death penalty now.

46:29.300 --> 46:30.834
- If only we could
find someone else

46:30.900 --> 46:32.934
to corroborate
your story.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.700
- Oh, fuck,
wait, there is.

46:35.767 --> 46:38.166
I've been so distracted,
I forgot--Glen Shupe.

46:38.233 --> 46:41.600
He overheard Li
threatening my ma.

46:41.667 --> 46:43.066
- I'll go tell Leo.

46:51.333 --> 46:53.266
You gotta handle it
so careful.

46:53.333 --> 46:57.233
You know, you gotta treat it
like a piece of fine glass.

46:57.300 --> 47:00.000
It's that fragile.

47:00.066 --> 47:01.633
- What is?

47:01.700 --> 47:03.567
- Happiness.

47:10.867 --> 47:12.834
- Did you or did you not
tell Ryan O'Reily

47:12.900 --> 47:15.967
that Li Chen was gonna
rape O'Reily's mother?

47:16.033 --> 47:18.000
- I did not.

47:18.066 --> 47:19.700
- Take him back
to Emerald City.

47:19.767 --> 47:21.367
- I think I need to go
into protective custody.

47:21.433 --> 47:22.867
- Okay.

47:26.433 --> 47:29.834
- Leo, it's obvious
he's lying.

47:29.900 --> 47:32.934
He did tell Ryan
about Li Chen.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.400
- Listen, it's not for me
to decide, Peter Marie.

47:34.467 --> 47:36.333
That's the jury's job,

47:36.400 --> 47:38.533
but you better explain
to Cyril O'Reily

47:38.600 --> 47:41.967
+that what he needs now
is a good lawyer.

47:42.033 --> 47:44.100
- Yeah, this is gonna
be a tough one.

47:44.166 --> 47:46.600
The history
of Cyril's violent behavior,

47:46.667 --> 47:48.767
the death
of Hamid Khan,

47:48.834 --> 47:53.734
putting Jia Kenmin in a coma,
various other altercations.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.767
That'll all play right into
the prosecution's hands.

47:55.834 --> 47:57.333
And, Sister,
according to your analysis,

47:57.400 --> 47:58.500
he knows right
from wrong.

47:58.567 --> 48:00.266
- Yes.

48:00.333 --> 48:03.300
- Right, like I said,
this is gonna be tough.

48:06.700 --> 48:07.734
I'll take the case.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.100
- You will?

48:09.166 --> 48:11.000
- But Mr. O'Reily,
if I were in your shoes,

48:11.066 --> 48:13.200
I'd go with
a name brand.

48:13.266 --> 48:16.200
- Wait, what do you mean
a name brand?

48:16.266 --> 48:17.800
- A lawyer
who can razzle-dazzle,

48:17.867 --> 48:21.800
someone who will turn Cyril's
mental state into a cause,

48:21.867 --> 48:24.900
headlines, op-ed pieces,
segments on the nightly news.

48:24.967 --> 48:27.400
- You can't do that?
- Not as well as others.

48:27.467 --> 48:29.867
You need Barnum
and F. Lee Bailey,

48:29.934 --> 48:31.900
Johnnie Cochran,
Ken Starr.

48:31.967 --> 48:33.533
- Come on, get real,
those guys are expensive.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.100
- Yes.

48:35.166 --> 48:38.800
- So, I guess the question
for you and your family is...

48:38.867 --> 48:41.367
How much is your
brother's life worth?

48:44.133 --> 48:45.300
- so, I'm the cause
of all of this?

48:45.367 --> 48:46.900
- Ah, no,
you're not.

48:46.967 --> 48:48.200
- Yeah, because you
tried to warn me

48:48.266 --> 48:50.100
that something could happen,
and I didn't listen.

48:50.166 --> 48:52.266
- Look, don't
blame yourself, okay?

48:52.333 --> 48:54.400
The truth is, having you around
has been great for me and Cyril.

48:54.467 --> 48:56.266
Now we just gotta
figure out some way

48:56.333 --> 48:57.533
to get him off
of death row.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.233
- Let's do
what that woman said.

48:59.300 --> 49:00.734
Let's hire
a big-time attorney.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.934
- You got money?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
- Well, I've got
some savings.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.467
- Well, whatever you have
is not gonna be enough.

49:05.533 --> 49:07.200
- Well, have you talked
to your father,

49:07.266 --> 49:08.967
to your Aunt Brenda?

49:09.033 --> 49:10.266
- Why, what good
would that do?

49:10.333 --> 49:11.600
- Well, I'm not sure,

49:11.667 --> 49:14.667
but they--they deserve
to know what's going on.

49:14.734 --> 49:16.233
We need
a family meeting.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.400
- You and Dad,
in the same room?

49:18.467 --> 49:20.667
- Yes.
- Have you seen him lately?

49:20.734 --> 49:23.333
- No, I haven't seen Seamus
O'Reily for over 30 years.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.066
But I can't think
of a better reason

49:25.133 --> 49:27.500
to stare
the old bastard down.

49:28.967 --> 49:30.734
- I don't know.

49:43.166 --> 49:44.734
Hey, Dad.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.066
Aunt Brenda, hi.

49:46.133 --> 49:47.433
How are you?

49:47.500 --> 49:49.767
- I brought
chocolate peanut clusters,

49:49.834 --> 49:51.800
Cyril's favorite kind.

49:51.867 --> 49:53.533
- Oh, I'll make sure
he gets 'em, thanks.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.867
Have a seat.

49:54.934 --> 49:56.800
- Suzanne.

49:56.867 --> 49:58.800
- Brenda.

49:58.867 --> 50:01.834
- For God's sake, Seamus,
we came all this way.

50:01.900 --> 50:03.467
Take another two steps.

50:03.533 --> 50:05.800
- I won't bite.

50:05.867 --> 50:07.000
I promise.

50:07.066 --> 50:10.300
- Like you ever
kept a promise?

50:10.367 --> 50:12.433
Let's get down
to business.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.100
- Okay, so I, uh,
I explained the particulars

50:19.166 --> 50:20.734
to the both of you
over the phone

50:20.800 --> 50:22.633
and I just--
I need to know.

50:22.700 --> 50:27.767
Can we afford to hire the best
lawyer to defend Cyril?

50:27.834 --> 50:30.166
- Well, how much
are we talking here?

50:30.233 --> 50:31.400
- Upwards of 20,000.

50:31.467 --> 50:33.533
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.000
- Well, neither one of us
have that kind of money,

50:36.066 --> 50:38.500
not even if we stacked together
our nickels and dimes.

50:38.567 --> 50:41.800
- Aunt Brenda, I remember
when you got hurt on the job,

50:41.867 --> 50:43.200
and the company,

50:43.266 --> 50:44.667
they cut you a big,
fat compensation check.

50:44.734 --> 50:46.567
- That's the money
I live on, Ryan.

50:46.633 --> 50:50.033
I mean, that's all
I have for my old age.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.066
- Don't you be asking Brenda
to risk her future

50:52.133 --> 50:53.400
because of Cyril.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.667
- She says
she loves him.

50:54.734 --> 50:56.600
- I do.
- But not enough.

50:56.667 --> 50:58.333
- Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

50:58.400 --> 51:00.633
How come your mother hasn't
asked her family to step up?

51:00.700 --> 51:02.934
- You know as well as I
that my family disowned me.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.533
- Oh, that's right,
they disowned you.

51:05.600 --> 51:10.266
But not for walking away from
your husband, your children, no.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.500
For blowing up
that cop.

51:11.567 --> 51:14.033
For bringing shame
on your father,

51:14.100 --> 51:15.867
the lace-curtain fuck!

51:15.934 --> 51:21.233
- I have accepted responsibility
for my actions, Seamus.

51:21.300 --> 51:22.700
Maybe it's time
you did the same.

51:22.767 --> 51:27.667
- Hey, I took fucking
responsibility 32 years ago!

51:27.734 --> 51:29.633
By putting food
in their mouth,

51:29.700 --> 51:31.100
paying the rent,
wiping their dirty asses!

51:31.166 --> 51:33.767
And where were you?
Where the fuck were you?

51:33.834 --> 51:35.567
- Let me ask you something,
Seamus.

51:35.633 --> 51:39.166
And tell me the truth
for the first time in your life.

51:39.233 --> 51:41.934
You and Tessie got together
real quick after I left,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.500
and you had Cyril
a year after we had Ryan.

51:45.567 --> 51:47.066
- So?

51:47.133 --> 51:49.934
- So, were you fucking her
behind my back?

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
- Yeah.

51:52.066 --> 51:54.233
In fact, I fucked her
the day Ryan was born.

51:54.300 --> 51:55.734
- Okay, enough!

51:55.800 --> 51:57.500
Please.

52:03.033 --> 52:05.734
We're talking
about Cyril here, okay?

52:05.800 --> 52:08.100
You know,
I mean, shit,

52:08.166 --> 52:10.066
we're talking
about saving his life.

52:10.133 --> 52:13.200
I mean,
this shit don't matter.

52:13.266 --> 52:14.633
I mean...

52:14.700 --> 52:15.834
- You're wrong, Ryan.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.734
The shit
is all there is.

52:18.800 --> 52:22.700
You say we have
to save him, for what?

52:22.767 --> 52:24.066
A lifetime in Oz,

52:24.133 --> 52:27.533
you know, with
his mind all a muddle?

52:27.600 --> 52:34.500
Maybe the only generous thing
we can all do for the boy

52:34.567 --> 52:36.567
is to let him die.

52:38.133 --> 52:39.633
- What?

52:39.700 --> 52:41.667
- Come on, Seamus,
give me a ride home.

52:41.734 --> 52:44.133
- No, no, Brenda,
please don't go.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.533
Please?

52:45.600 --> 52:47.800
- There's more.

52:47.867 --> 52:51.033
There has to be more to a family
than just blood, Ryan,

52:51.100 --> 52:55.333
more than Christmas dinners
and the birthday cakes,

52:55.400 --> 52:59.767
and more than old hurts
and unsettled scores.

52:59.834 --> 53:01.533
We're not a family.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.033
We never have been.

53:04.100 --> 53:08.433
You knocked on
the wrong door, honey.

53:14.033 --> 53:17.500
- See you in another
three decades, you cunt.

53:30.333 --> 53:35.100
- I'm so...
I'm so sorry for that, I...

53:35.166 --> 53:37.200
- No, it's okay.
It actually, uh...

53:37.266 --> 53:39.133
Went better
than I expected.

53:43.367 --> 53:45.066
Oh, Ryan.

53:45.133 --> 53:48.400
You know, she is wrong,
she's wrong,

53:48.467 --> 53:52.767
because you and me and Cyril,
we are  a family.

53:52.834 --> 53:54.567
I mean, maybe we're
tattered and torn,

53:54.633 --> 53:56.800
but we're gonna
get through this.

54:01.266 --> 54:03.800
- Yeah, Aunt Brenda's right
about one thing, though.

54:06.734 --> 54:09.500
The best thing we can do
for Cyril is to let him die.

54:21.667 --> 54:23.133
- Oh, shit.

54:33.667 --> 54:35.033
- Hiya, Ryan.

54:35.100 --> 54:37.066
- Hey, kid.

54:39.133 --> 54:41.600
Oh, wait.
Shh, shh, shh.

54:41.667 --> 54:42.900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
it's okay.

54:42.967 --> 54:44.734
- What happened?

54:49.166 --> 54:50.934
Was I bad again?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.533
- Yeah.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.066
- Sorry.

54:55.133 --> 54:57.166
- It's okay.

54:59.100 --> 55:02.834
- Can we go back
to Em City now?

55:02.900 --> 55:06.066
- No, Cyril, I'm afraid
you have to go back to Solitary.

55:06.133 --> 55:09.133
- I don't like Solitary.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.567
- Oh, I know.

55:10.633 --> 55:13.533
- It's scary.
- I know.

55:14.433 --> 55:16.033
- It's lonely.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.567
- Believe me, if I could
trade places with you,

55:17.633 --> 55:20.166
I'd do it
in a fucking second.

55:24.300 --> 55:26.166
- Ryan?
- Yeah?

55:26.233 --> 55:28.533
- Are you crying?

55:28.600 --> 55:32.633
- No, boys don't cry.

55:32.700 --> 55:35.033
- That's right.

55:35.100 --> 55:38.934
Daddy always said,
"Boys don't cry."

55:39.000 --> 55:40.533
- And daddy knows best.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.266
- Out of the way,
O'Reily.

55:43.333 --> 55:46.500
Are you gonna
behave yourself, hmm?

55:47.567 --> 55:49.633
- Yes, sir.

56:02.667 --> 56:04.233
- Listen...

56:04.300 --> 56:06.867
For all the gypsies,
seers, tea leaves,

56:06.934 --> 56:08.967
tarot cards,
and ouija boards,

56:09.033 --> 56:11.200
your life
is your fucking life.

56:11.266 --> 56:12.867
No, check that.

56:12.934 --> 56:15.233
There is one person who tells
the future for a living,

56:15.300 --> 56:17.800
and he's right 100%
of the time.

56:17.867 --> 56:21.500
Who's this
magical motherfucker?

56:21.567 --> 56:22.734
He's called the judge.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.133
And all of us in Oz,

56:25.200 --> 56:28.333
we got our fortunes told.

56:28.400 --> 56:31.500
And let me tell you,
the future...

56:32.333 --> 56:34.300
It ain't bright.
