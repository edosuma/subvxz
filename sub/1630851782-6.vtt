WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:08.442
MARIAH:
So,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.611
I know you've been in the dumps,
but I have the best

00:10.744 --> 00:12.313
weekend planned.
I'm talking tacos,

00:12.446 --> 00:14.748
pizza, Korean barbecue,
if I can convince Dad.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.185
And-- wait for it--
an all-weekend anime marathon.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.091
Hayden,

00:23.191 --> 00:25.259
you, uh... you there?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.928
I'm sorry.
My mind was elsewhere.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.663
I'm-I'm sure whatever

00:29.797 --> 00:33.301
this Annie Mae does is sure
to be remarkable.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.036
That's not... (sighs)

00:36.170 --> 00:38.872
Are you still thinking
of busting Mildred

00:39.006 --> 00:41.709
out of that hospital?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.381
(screaming)

00:49.183 --> 00:51.719
Hayden, where...
where'd you go?

00:51.852 --> 00:55.123
I just had a... vision

00:55.223 --> 00:58.626
of Mildred in pain.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
Being treated worse
at this new facility

01:00.861 --> 01:03.564
than anything
in the video you leaked.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.667
Look, I-I know
it sounds crazy.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.502
No, it-it doesn't sound crazy.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.970
I mean, visions from the
universe are no joke.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.839
Some people just have,
like, a hella open

01:11.972 --> 01:13.374
third eye.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.378
So, if the universe says
Mildred's in trouble...

01:17.511 --> 01:19.747
My world-famous Kaminski Cakes
are ready.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.482
I know how much you
enjoyed 'em last time,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.083
Hayden, so I doubled the batch.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.552
I don't enjoy them.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.321
I love them.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.157
They make me feel like
this is home,

01:29.257 --> 01:31.892
that I'm wanted.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.195
Well, you most definitely
are, bud.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.896
Okay, well, uh,

01:36.029 --> 01:37.531
get 'em while they're hot.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.900
And, uh, when you're done,
I'll drop you off

01:40.033 --> 01:41.869
at the hotel
for your first check-in.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.940
Are you sure
about saving Mildred?

01:48.376 --> 01:50.778
Yes.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.281
Without her, I...

01:55.082 --> 01:58.452
I don't know
if I can be without her.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.458
I'll help. Okay? Just

02:04.592 --> 02:08.128
promise me
my dad will never find out.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.770
And I can't believe the 4,400
have to be out of the hotel

02:16.904 --> 02:18.439
by the end of the week.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.040
After all that fuss
to keep them there,

02:20.140 --> 02:22.876
now it's just... bye.
Yeah.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.312
With nothing but a stipend

02:24.445 --> 02:26.214
and some housing
to help them adjust.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.648
But they've left
Claudette alone.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.617
It must mean they
don't know about her.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.385
Or that we know about her.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.587
Man.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.489
No, I'm still kind of shook.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.225
I mean, superpowers are real.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.760
And Claudette wants us
to believe that it's just her.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.629
Girl just wants to be left alone
to live her life.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.464
She's currently nesting

02:43.597 --> 02:44.998
pretty hard
in my brother's apartment,

02:45.132 --> 02:47.501
but, well, I can't be mad
at her for that.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.137
(sighs) No.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.006
Yo, you're not having
second thoughts, right?

02:53.140 --> 02:54.508
About telling
the government,

02:54.642 --> 02:56.009
telling your girlfriend?
No.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.345
I don't trust
telling the government

02:57.478 --> 02:58.512
anything at this point.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.848
I mean, what
would I say anyway?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.916
A '50s housewife is Wolverine?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.985
(laughs) True.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.787
You think she's the only one?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.623
Between Shanice escaping,
our nap at Belle Isle,

03:09.757 --> 03:12.693
and whatever went down
with Mildred, there's no way.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.462
(scoffs)

03:14.595 --> 03:15.863
Man, if the government
had even an inkling

03:15.996 --> 03:17.365
about half of this...

03:17.498 --> 03:19.300
The 4,400 would be
locked back up.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.835
Yeah, I want to help them,
but I don't know how.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.838
I'll tell you what we do.
We ask them.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.708
Trust me, I have
learned the hard way

03:27.841 --> 03:29.777
that you can't fix people's
lives the way you want to.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.713
You got to find out
what they need.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.716
And the hard part is gonna be
getting them to talk to us.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.718
ANDRE: Will you be

03:37.851 --> 03:39.387
returning to Miami then?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.888
My mom wants me to,

03:41.021 --> 03:42.723
but some producers
reached out.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.192
Maybe I just go straight to L.A.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.329
I don't know. What about you?
Back to New York?

03:48.462 --> 03:51.799
Perhaps. Although I'm not sure
what's left for me there now.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.301
And Shanice isn't there?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.035
Well, that is...
There isn't...

03:55.168 --> 03:57.037
She and I aren't...
I need your help.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.906
Oh, young Hayden.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.809
How are things at the,
uh... the house?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.911
At Shanice's husband's
and daughter's house?

04:04.912 --> 04:07.047
What? It's not my
fault you're a messy,

04:07.180 --> 04:09.249
time-travelling doctor
who lives for drama.
It has been

04:09.383 --> 04:11.419
two weeks since Noah and Mildred
were taken to Ypsi Med.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.086
I want us to go get them out.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.392
Look, I had a vision.
Of Mildred.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
And a chartreuse door.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.764
She was screaming and being
injected with something.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.166
(screaming)
For some reason,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.935
I keep seeing it again...

04:28.068 --> 04:30.671
(screaming)
...and again and again.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.939
(screaming)

04:34.074 --> 04:35.242
Look, we have to save her.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.744
If we don't do it
soon, I think

04:36.877 --> 04:37.945
something terrible
is gonna happen to her.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.380
Look, I have a plan,

04:39.513 --> 04:40.781
but I need you both to do it.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.783
I need your powers, LaDonna.
Oh, okay.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.084
And your medical background,

04:44.217 --> 04:45.886
Dr. Andre.
What? Like, you leave

04:46.019 --> 04:47.588
for a few days, and all of
a sudden, you're Danny Ocean?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.423
LaDonna, the boy
misses his friends.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.760
We understand
you're concerned, but

04:52.893 --> 04:55.295
what you're suggesting
is a bit extreme.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.797
We're all about
to be released.

04:56.930 --> 04:57.865
Now, this sort of action

04:57.965 --> 04:59.867
could very well jeopardize that.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.635
Especially when Jharrel
and Keisha know about

05:01.769 --> 05:03.804
Claudette's powers. You didn't
know about that, did you?

05:03.937 --> 05:07.441
Look, she was barely able to
cover up for the rest of us, so,

05:07.575 --> 05:10.310
now is not the time for people
to be putting a spotlight on us.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.912
Mm. Besides,
you said yourself,

05:12.045 --> 05:14.948
sometimes your visions
aren't always complete.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.116
They don't repeat, either.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.151
Look, time
is running out.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.653
I can't just sit by
and do nothing.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.990
I need her back.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.959
(indistinct chatter)
(jazz playing)

05:31.465 --> 05:34.234
That's Ruth's boy, right?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.903
Yep.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.171
My sister spawned a bit
of an odd duck,

05:38.305 --> 05:39.773
if you catch my meaning.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.943
And she's having to raise
the boy all on her own. Mm.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.449
How you doing, boy?

05:48.582 --> 05:49.850
You're being mighty rude
not saying anything

05:49.983 --> 05:51.351
to your Uncle Otis.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.454
Hello.
Look at

05:53.587 --> 05:55.155
your elders when
they're talking to you.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.024
Now, if you're gonna keep
being disrespectful...

05:57.157 --> 05:58.759
Then I'll discipline him.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.360
Now, why don't you both
go get some drinks

06:00.494 --> 06:01.695
so people can have an excuse

06:01.829 --> 06:03.697
of why you're acting
a fool right now.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.769
Come on, baby.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.541
Hayden.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.009
Hey.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.312
Hey.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.316
Could you play a game
of chess with me, please?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.718
Uh, I don't want
to bother you,

06:24.852 --> 06:26.186
but I really need this.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.557
First, you're gonna sit down,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.625
and you're gonna breathe.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.862
Yeah.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.197
Hey.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.700
Yeah.

06:44.672 --> 06:48.141
Now, despite how it looks,

06:48.241 --> 06:49.910
I'm busy right now,

06:50.043 --> 06:51.579
so I can't play with you.

06:51.712 --> 06:55.516
So I need you to be
the sharp young man

06:55.649 --> 06:56.850
that I know you are

06:56.984 --> 06:59.219
and find a solution
for yourself.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.589
Hey, hey.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.224
Focus, Hayden.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.326
You want to play chess.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.428
But I can't play with you.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.933
So how can you play
without me?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.870
I...

07:17.004 --> 07:19.106
I could... I...

07:19.239 --> 07:21.875
I could play against myself.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.713
Oh, I knew you could do it.

07:25.846 --> 07:29.416
Us Turners are amazing
problem solvers.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.619
Mwah.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.256
I can't lose her for good.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.125
I won't.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.032
REV:
Amen, brothers and sisters.
See you tomorrow.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.400
Absolutely. Absolutely.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.737
Thank you, brother,
I appreciate you.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.609
Thank you so much for
these meetings, Reverend.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.911
Before I found
this group,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.146
I was in a
really dark place.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.881
I thought God
abandoned me.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.484
Just remember, the Lord
doesn't leave us in darkness

08:04.618 --> 08:05.819
without a little light.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.155
A thing you know
better than most.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.058
Thank you.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
Mm-hmm.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.329
Have you seen Andre?

08:16.463 --> 08:17.765
I have not.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.300
But I do want to pick
your lawyer brain,

08:20.433 --> 08:21.769
if you don't mind.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.671
I'd like to find a way
to get the powers that be

08:23.804 --> 08:25.806
to allow folks
to stay at the hotel.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.809
What? Everyone
is finally getting out.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.844
After all our pushing
and protesting,

08:30.978 --> 08:32.012
we're gonna be free.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.681
Well, many people,
myself included,

08:33.814 --> 08:34.982
have nowhere to go.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.484
This "freedom" might be
a salve for you,

08:37.618 --> 08:40.420
but for myself and others,
it's poison.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.656
Everyone is getting
placed in housing

08:42.790 --> 08:43.791
and given a stipend.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.525
You think everybody getting out

08:45.659 --> 08:48.528
is the solution because
it works for your situation.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.998
You'll be staying with
family, I presume?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.433
Mrs. Grover
is like family to me.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.368
And I'm pleased
that you have her.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.705
This is a turbulent time
for us all.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.041
And for some, being thrown
into housing they don't know

09:01.174 --> 09:02.676
in a city they don't know,

09:02.810 --> 09:05.946
in a world they don't know
is terrifying.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.216
We've created
a community here.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.985
I'm sorry you can't see that.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.028
They couldn't kick you out
if the hotel was a church.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.133
Would it really work?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.901
It's not a given,

09:28.035 --> 09:30.303
but most still respect
the concept of sanctuary

09:30.403 --> 09:32.673
that churches offer.
If the government

09:32.806 --> 09:35.075
tried to kick us out, they'd
be drowning in lawsuits

09:35.208 --> 09:36.710
from human rights groups
worldwide.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.980
We just have to
get the word out.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.651
Well... let's create ourselves

09:43.751 --> 09:45.418
a sanctuary, then.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.255
LADONNA:
Technically,

09:48.388 --> 09:49.723
you are the reason both
of them are at Ypsi Med.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.391
Not on purpose, of course,
but, you know,

09:51.524 --> 09:53.060
accident or not,
you do have to kind of

09:53.193 --> 09:54.494
take responsibility for that.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.597
Well, as far a responsibility
is concerned,

09:57.731 --> 10:01.001
your video made us targets for
all sorts of ne'er-do-wells,

10:01.101 --> 10:03.737
like that bar patron
who assaulted Claudette.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.238
TouchÃ©.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.707
It's just,
I've never seen Hayden

10:06.840 --> 10:08.208
like that before, you know?
He's usually

10:08.341 --> 10:10.177
all al-aloof and stuff.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.412
But back there he looked really
ready to, like, square up.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.281
Indeed.
So what do we do, then?

10:14.414 --> 10:15.949
'Cause he is
really stubborn

10:16.083 --> 10:17.117
and is not gonna
let this go.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.252
Trust him, I suppose.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.122
The hotel is abuzz
with everyone getting out,

10:22.255 --> 10:24.291
so our keepers
aren't watching us as usual.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.293
And while lacking in context,

10:26.426 --> 10:29.396
his visions come to pass
with unerring accuracy.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.731
HAYDEN:
Great!

10:30.864 --> 10:32.599
Now let's get on with it.
Stop doing that.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.467
Oh, my God, you're gonna
give me so many stress lines.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.469
You said you had a plan.
I do.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.272
We want to get Mildred and Noah
out of Ypsi Med,

10:39.406 --> 10:40.941
hide them in here
till things quiet down.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.142
First step:

10:42.275 --> 10:43.643
reconnaissance.

10:43.777 --> 10:47.547
Starting with
one chartreuse door.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.253
ANDRE:
The technological advances
here are greater

10:53.386 --> 10:54.454
than even I'd imagined.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.957
(shutter clicks)
Okay. I'm glad

10:57.090 --> 10:58.591
you're enjoying everything.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.460
Look, I know it's
taken a long time

11:00.593 --> 11:01.795
to get you into a hospital.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.563
And I cannot apologize
enough for that.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.334
But we're here now, and while
you're doing your shadowing,

11:07.467 --> 11:09.569
I'm gonna try and get some info
on Mildred and Noah for you.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.604
It is appreciated.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.673
It's been so long since we last
heard from either of them,

11:13.807 --> 11:16.744
I'd begun to think our pleas
had fallen on deaf ears.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.746
(chuckles)

11:22.449 --> 11:23.784
Name?
Jharrel Mateo.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.285
I have a shadowing appointment

11:25.418 --> 11:26.653
for my friend right here.
Uh-huh.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.288
I'll let the doctor know
he's here.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.622
Oh, I had one more thing.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.158
Could you get me
the room info

11:31.291 --> 11:33.927
so that I can visit Mildred Bell
and Noah Harris?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.029
They're from the
Bois Blanc hotel.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.366
The 4,400 are
in a different wing

11:39.499 --> 11:41.201
and don't have visiting hours.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.838
A different wing? Okay, but,
uh, I'm not a regular visitor.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.940
I'm a caseworker.
The 4,400?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.843
Like I said, there are
no visiting hours.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.711
Haven't been since they
took over the East Wing.

11:53.947 --> 11:57.384
Go ahead and fill this out,
and here's a pass

11:57.517 --> 12:00.120
for you and your friend.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.655
(camera clicks)

12:03.656 --> 12:05.292
Miguel?

12:12.532 --> 12:13.967
(lock buzzes)

12:19.139 --> 12:21.341
Were you able
to get everything?

12:21.474 --> 12:24.878
Hayden, my boy, my lad,
my homie,

12:25.012 --> 12:28.248
I got everything
and then some, okay?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.050
First, we have nurse scrubs.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.920
A size medium
for one Dr. Andre.

12:33.053 --> 12:38.025
Then we have patient scrubs
for you. (chuckles)

12:38.158 --> 12:40.060
And then, there it is.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.429
Thumb drives,
requested by LaDonna.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.564
Why are thumb drives
shaped like food?

12:44.697 --> 12:49.736
No? Okay, well, then we have
three two-way radios

12:49.870 --> 12:51.771
and some earpieces.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.406
And...

12:56.576 --> 12:58.278
It's labradorite.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.880
A gemstone well respected
for its ability

13:00.013 --> 13:01.581
to banish fear and anxiety.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.951
It can also boost
psychic abilities.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.719
Try it on. Come on.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.289
(chuckles)

13:09.422 --> 13:10.924
Why'd you get it?

13:11.058 --> 13:14.127
'Cause I want to make sure
you make it out in one piece.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.729
And we have an anime marathon
to do still, so...

13:16.864 --> 13:20.800
Oh, um, my, um...

13:20.934 --> 13:22.469
Shanice doesn't know

13:22.602 --> 13:26.639
anything about this, does she?

13:26.773 --> 13:29.642
No.
Okay, good.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.478
Do-do you want her to?

13:31.611 --> 13:32.745
No, not at all.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.814
I mean, she'd probably freak out

13:34.948 --> 13:37.317
that this is really dangerous.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.289
I know I'm just
the getaway driver--

13:42.422 --> 13:44.824
and I'm all in-- but,

13:44.958 --> 13:46.293
I mean, I only have
my learner's permit.

13:46.426 --> 13:51.564
Hayden, this is all
totally necessary. Right?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.968
We have to get them out.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.970
I know what they do
in places like that.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.805
The guards here
assaulted Noah.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.741
The government stole him
away on my birthday.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.847
They took Mildred, the
closest person to me, away.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.517
Refused to let me know anything
about how she's doing.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.685
And they destroyed
the chess set she gave me.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.654
The set she made for me.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.456
The only thing
I had left of her.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.826
So, yes, this has to happen
because I need Mildred,

14:19.960 --> 14:22.996
and I'm gonna bring her back.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.531
RUTH:
Hayden, Hayden.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.500
I'm so sorry.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.835
(groans)

14:28.969 --> 14:31.204
It was a long day
visiting factories,

14:31.338 --> 14:34.341
but I finally found
a distributor.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.010
Your mom's baked goods
are gonna be sold

14:37.144 --> 14:39.446
all through the Midwest.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.813
(sighs)

14:40.948 --> 14:42.549
I left a note
to your Aunt Marietta

14:42.682 --> 14:45.152
explaining that you are
sensitive to certain textures.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.221
She should have known better
than to make you noodles.
It's fine.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.057
No, it's not.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.025
Sweetie, why didn't you
say anything to her?

14:52.159 --> 14:53.826
I didn't want to.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.996
Are you mad?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.198
Never.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.569
I love how careful
you are with your words,

15:02.702 --> 15:05.305
but you need to advocate
for yourself.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.010
Watch carefully, crumb cake.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.678
I'm gonna show you something.
(chuckles)

15:16.316 --> 15:19.086
RUTH:
Solving a problem is
a lot like baking.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.556
We start with what we want,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.692
then look at what tools
and ingredients

15:25.825 --> 15:27.995
we have at our disposal.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.831
We put those together, and...

15:32.899 --> 15:34.067
...we get the thing we wanted.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.336
(chuckles)

15:40.873 --> 15:42.209
Mmm...

15:42.342 --> 15:44.877
(both laughing)

15:45.012 --> 15:47.347
Come here, come here.
There you go, baby.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.187
Oh, how did
the reconnaissance go?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.357
You two won't believe
the things I've seen.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.960
In that device is a video
of Miguel-- yes,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.296
our doctor here
at the Bois Blanc--

16:03.430 --> 16:07.567
taking a 4,400 through
that chartreuse door.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.802
And I caught him on video
as he put in the code

16:09.936 --> 16:11.638
to open the door.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.241
No way. You're, like,
totally the GOAT right now.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.985
What the hell?

16:30.723 --> 16:32.225
I taught you better than this.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.062
Hayden, uh...
Hayden, I'm sorry

16:35.162 --> 16:36.429
to have jeopardized
the mission.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.331
We need to get behind
that door.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.632
Which means we need the code.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.574
Wait, you saw him.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.608
You saw him punch it in.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.510
Yes, but I don't remember.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.512
But Shanice can see
your memory; she can see it.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.981
I don't think that's a good...
(stammers)

16:55.115 --> 16:57.184
Isn't there any other way?

16:57.317 --> 16:58.351
What the doctor's
trying to say is that

16:58.485 --> 16:59.852
something happened
between them

16:59.986 --> 17:01.421
to make things
capital-A awkward.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.290
Getting Mildred and Noah
out of that place

17:03.423 --> 17:05.958
has to be more important than
whatever discomfort you have.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.261
Please.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.035
* Oh, my

17:16.169 --> 17:17.604
* I'm just so tired *

17:17.704 --> 17:19.972
* On my mind are
so many things... *

17:20.107 --> 17:21.774
SHANICE:
Imagine my surprise

17:21.874 --> 17:23.543
when I heard you wanted to meet.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.978
Even ordered you
a drink.

17:26.113 --> 17:29.549
I just wanted to try and build
a bridge between us.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.983
One of more honest
communication.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.219
Really?

17:33.186 --> 17:37.490
* We can run away tonight...

17:37.624 --> 17:41.060
Well, if we're being
honest, uh...

17:41.194 --> 17:43.363
there are a group of people
at the hotel

17:43.496 --> 17:45.565
who have created a church here.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.334
They don't want to leave.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.303
Why would anyone want to stay
at the hotel

17:50.403 --> 17:52.905
after all that time
wanting out?

17:54.374 --> 17:57.244
Are...

17:57.377 --> 18:00.147
are you... scared?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.715
What are you getting at?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.818
I know about the powers.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.821
I saw Claudette heal herself
in this bar, and...

18:08.921 --> 18:10.357
she admitted it to Jharrel.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.759
What exactly did she say?

18:12.892 --> 18:15.262
That it has nothing to do
with the 4,400,

18:15.395 --> 18:17.697
and she was a secret superhero

18:17.830 --> 18:19.832
in the '50s,
and, I quote,

18:19.932 --> 18:21.568
"Wonder Woman was Black first."

18:21.701 --> 18:23.770
(laughs)

18:23.903 --> 18:25.172
You must have been

18:25.272 --> 18:26.339
pretty tipsy that night.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.907
I don't know how

18:28.040 --> 18:29.276
you let Claudette yank
your chain like that...

18:29.409 --> 18:31.043
Shanice, I know what I saw.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.546
You know I saw it,
since it happened
at Mrs. Grover's, too.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.183
Jharrel and I think
there are more of you

18:36.283 --> 18:38.117
that have
some kind of...

18:38.251 --> 18:40.253
powers.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.555
But we can't confirm that
unless you open up.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.123
And if you don't open up,

18:44.257 --> 18:45.392
we can't protect you.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.626
We'll be fine.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.060
I've tussled

18:48.195 --> 18:49.061
with the
government before.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.264
Yeah, in 2005.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.233
The 2021 government is
a whole different beast, okay?

18:53.366 --> 18:56.203
You have no idea
what it's capable of.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.707
Have fun hunting down

19:00.807 --> 19:01.874
the other members of the...

19:01.974 --> 19:03.576
Justice League.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.279
(scoffs)

19:14.587 --> 19:15.822
(crickets chirping)

19:15.955 --> 19:16.989
ANDRE:
Shanice.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.760
Andre. Hi.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.062
I thought you
were avoiding me.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.164
I've... just been busy.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.066
Oh.

19:28.067 --> 19:31.338
I do have something
I need to talk to you about.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.939
(exhales)

19:33.072 --> 19:34.507
Hayden, LaDonna and myself
are planning on rescuing

19:34.641 --> 19:36.643
Mildred and Noah from Ypsi Med.

19:37.644 --> 19:38.945
Andre, no.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.180
What will they do to you
if you get caught?

19:41.314 --> 19:44.451
This is the time for us
to keep our heads down.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.185
They already know
about Claudette.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.087
And Keisha asked me directly
if more of us have powers.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.589
She's not gonna
let it go

19:49.689 --> 19:51.424
until she finds something.
Well, the situation

19:51.524 --> 19:53.993
isn't ideal,
but Hayden had a vision

19:54.126 --> 19:56.996
of Mildred being held
and injected with something

19:57.129 --> 19:58.298
in a separate wing of Ypsi Med.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.167
It's likely Noah's there
as well.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.635
Right now...

20:02.769 --> 20:06.038
our whole plan rests
on you recovering a code

20:06.172 --> 20:07.340
from my memory.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.509
Can you help us?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.445
(sighs)

20:13.713 --> 20:15.615
Knowing how
we've been treated here,

20:15.715 --> 20:18.451
I wouldn't be surprised
if some places are even worse.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.388
(exhales)

20:21.521 --> 20:22.855
Let's do this.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.796
*

20:41.541 --> 20:43.376
(gasps softly)

20:43.510 --> 20:44.577
Do you see it?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.012
No, I...

20:46.145 --> 20:48.080
I see the hospital,
but it's all hazy.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.849
Nothing really concrete.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.485
Keep trying. I know it's there.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.422
Look, I'm sorry.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.490
This is new to me.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.025
You can do this.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.394
I believe in you.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.097
(takes deep breath)

21:05.231 --> 21:07.500
*

21:19.278 --> 21:21.247
I got it. I got the code.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.416
(both laughing)

21:30.022 --> 21:31.724
Thanks, Logan.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.760
I love you.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.564
(gasps)

21:40.433 --> 21:42.068
Andre,

21:42.201 --> 21:44.236
I-I'm...
Mrs. Murray...

21:44.371 --> 21:47.774
the code, please.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.955
Thank you for your help.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.231
*

22:12.331 --> 22:13.933
Shanice was
a dead end.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.602
Scratch that,
she was a brick wall.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.169
Yeah, Andre really wasn't
in a talkative mood, either.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.238
(sighs) Look, clearly, if
we want them to open up,

22:19.338 --> 22:23.242
we got to do something to prove
to them that we can help.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.278
You know, actions speak louder
than words.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.015
Hey, what about,
uh, Mildred and Noah?

22:29.148 --> 22:31.651
If we got info on them, Hayden
might be open to talking to us.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.787
And frankly, I want to know
what's happening with them, too.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.355
Well, I got nothing.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.691
Okay, Ypsi Med
is apparently a fortress,

22:38.825 --> 22:41.293
with the 4,400
in some inaccessible wing

22:41.428 --> 22:43.663
and absolutely
no visiting hours.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.833
Well, I could go to Jessica,

22:46.966 --> 22:48.868
see if she can give me any info.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.971
You're gonna go to Ypsi Med?
You think that'll work?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.473
You said actions speak louder
than words.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.041
If we want them to trust us,

22:55.174 --> 22:57.309
e'll have to do something bold.w

23:01.113 --> 23:03.349
Where are you
taking him?

23:06.318 --> 23:07.954
LADONNA'S VOICE:
Um, he's...

23:08.054 --> 23:09.989
(deeper):
one of them.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.458
Okay.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.501
(lock buzzes)

23:29.375 --> 23:30.910
This is no hospital.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.912
There aren't even
any cameras.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.314
You said cameras
are ubiquitous.
Well, yeah,

23:35.414 --> 23:37.884
if you're not trying to be,
like, hella on the down-low.

23:38.017 --> 23:42.655
No cameras means no evidence.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.558
Okay, I'm gonna go
find Miguel's office.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.393
I'm still in awe
of the illusion.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.761
Cannot believe it is you.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.262
(laughs)
I suppose this is
where we part.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.164
Good luck, LaDonna.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.766
Do not forget to turn on

23:53.900 --> 23:55.502
your earpieces.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.704
We'll await your guidance
to find Mildred and Noah.

24:03.375 --> 24:07.614
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Medical staff must have
identification at all times.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.524
We'll wait here for
Miss LaDonna's instructions.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.601
(LaDonna laughs)

24:28.735 --> 24:31.037
Okay.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.473
It's the same.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.709
It's the same.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.745
This place.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.446
The walls.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.648
The restraints.

24:44.050 --> 24:47.286
(crying):
Nothing's changed.

24:48.721 --> 24:49.789
Hayden?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.290
Hayden, please.

24:51.423 --> 24:54.426
I need you to stay
with me now.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.730
I was in a place...
like Ypsi Med.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.766
I was put there by relatives

24:59.899 --> 25:02.334
after my mom died.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.504
She was only supposed
to be gone a week.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.843
Every night I went
to sleep there...

25:10.977 --> 25:14.814
I heard the screams of others.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.516
I tried not
to scream.

25:17.650 --> 25:21.654
I was already in pain...
from the tests.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.691
The endless tests.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.126
Hayden.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.494
Hayden,

25:28.628 --> 25:31.430
where are we?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.865
(pants)

25:32.999 --> 25:35.034
Ypsi Med.
Indeed.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.369
You're not in the sanitorium.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.807
The only reason
I'm not still there...

25:40.940 --> 25:43.843
is because the green zap
saved me.

25:43.976 --> 25:48.114
I won't argue with you.
This place is repugnant.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.483
And that is why
we are here to save them.

25:51.618 --> 25:52.318
(screams)

25:52.451 --> 25:53.786
Mildred and Noah.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.722
Yes, Mildred and Noah.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.824
Now, come back.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.992
Hey, as the leader
of this mission,

26:00.126 --> 26:02.028
they need you focused.

26:06.532 --> 26:09.836
Okay, the map is acquired.
I repeat: the map is acquired.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.638
You ready?

26:11.738 --> 26:12.672
Guys?

26:12.805 --> 26:14.641
Are you ready?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.075
(exhales sharply)

26:16.208 --> 26:17.744
We're ready.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.762
(applause over video)

26:38.197 --> 26:39.065
(grunting)

26:39.198 --> 26:40.833
(audience whoops)

26:40.933 --> 26:42.601
(applause)

26:42.735 --> 26:44.336
(siren chirps)

26:55.347 --> 26:57.950
License and registration,
please.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.586
Uh, can I ask why?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.188
Your tags are expired.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.023
Uh...

27:05.524 --> 27:06.926
I-I'm sorry.
(sighs)

27:07.059 --> 27:08.695
Can I make a phone call?

27:12.198 --> 27:13.700
Hang a left.
ANDRE:
Copy.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.868
Did you find any documentation
on that computer?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.536
Yeah, I'm on it.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.238
Better grab whatever I can.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.040
After one too many Twitter
arguments, your girl knows

27:21.140 --> 27:23.375
to always keep her receipts
at the ready.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.215
We can't go this way.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.983
Why? The coast
is clear.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.985
Not for long.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.388
(footsteps approaching,
indistinct talking)

27:36.488 --> 27:38.324
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:42.094 --> 27:44.596
ANDRE:
We need a new route.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.133
Okay, if you turn around
and make that right,

27:47.266 --> 27:48.735
that hallway
will take you around

27:48.835 --> 27:50.269
to the far end
of Mildred's block.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.084
*

28:24.703 --> 28:27.306
ANDRE:
It seems the restraints
are targeted.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.708
Designed to neutralize
our abilities.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.211
None of them should be here.

28:34.646 --> 28:35.714
Okay,

28:35.848 --> 28:37.049
once you make that turn,

28:37.183 --> 28:39.385
it'll take you
right to Mildred's room.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.223
There are two bullyboys
blocking our path.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.026
(transmission breaking up)
What is going on?

28:47.159 --> 28:49.328
Are you clear?

28:49.461 --> 28:50.729
Doc, can you hear me?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.331
ANDRE:
e must have lost Miss LaDonna.W

28:52.464 --> 28:53.532
Hey.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.134
I have an idea.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.003
A birdcall.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.871
That can't work.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.706
Men were always surprised
how well it worked

29:00.840 --> 29:01.908
in World War II.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.343
Sometimes simple solutions
are best.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.079
(imitating birdcall)

29:07.213 --> 29:08.915
Birdlady acting up again.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.649
Let's check it out.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.920
(whispering indistinctly)

29:18.590 --> 29:20.559
Let me go. Let go of me.
Mildred.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.929
Don't touch me!
Let me go!
Hayden, Hayden.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.363
You have to calm down.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.898
(screaming)
ANDRE:
We are not prepared

29:26.032 --> 29:27.333
for a frontal assault.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.001
I will tear them apart
myself if I have to.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.170
Now let me go.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.271
LADONNA'S VOICE:
Stop right there.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.608
(Mildred grunting)

29:36.742 --> 29:39.445
Injection gun. Now.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.415
(screams)

29:44.750 --> 29:46.218
Um, ma'am,

29:46.352 --> 29:48.254
we need to escort number
48 to the operating room.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.223
You're to, uh, go aid intake

29:51.357 --> 29:53.359
on the new one
that just arrived.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.027
They'll fill you in
on the details.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.896
(Mildred yelling)

29:57.029 --> 29:57.964
Oh, my God, go.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.231
Now.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.433
MILDRED:
Let me go!

30:01.567 --> 30:02.935
They're gone. They're gone.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.537
(Mildred yells)

30:05.637 --> 30:07.773
Okay, so not a single thanks
for totally saving your lives?

30:07.907 --> 30:08.941
Thank you, LaDonna.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.042
LaDonna?

30:10.142 --> 30:12.278
Hayden, is it really you?
Yes.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.480
And me.
We're all here for you.

30:14.613 --> 30:15.714
(gasping)

30:19.886 --> 30:20.920
Hey, you're safe.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.154
Okay, we're gonna
go save Noah

30:22.288 --> 30:23.422
and get out of here.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.431
GUARD:
What the hell?

30:32.564 --> 30:33.632
(thump)

30:33.765 --> 30:36.268
(yelling)

30:41.007 --> 30:42.608
(yells, gasps)

30:42.741 --> 30:44.076
Mildred, what are you doing?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.312
Showing him what
it's like to feel powerless.

30:46.445 --> 30:47.579
(yelling)

30:49.181 --> 30:50.482
(bones snapping)

30:50.616 --> 30:51.984
ANDRE:
Put him down.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.853
The-the human body isn't
meant to take such trauma.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.756
Sure it is.
He just has to push himself.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.625
That's what they told us.

30:59.758 --> 31:00.759
(screams)

31:06.198 --> 31:08.034
I'm sorry, but we had to stop
little Carrie here

31:08.167 --> 31:09.635
before she killed him.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.971
Did she?
Um, kill him?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.772
His ligaments must be shredded.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.976
And his bones...

31:17.977 --> 31:19.478
(whispers):
Shattered.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.691
Okay, Andre,

31:32.824 --> 31:33.792
we have to go-- now.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.361
But Noah.
There's no time.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.405
Come on!
Go, go, go.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.547
Um, where's our ride?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.549
Could Miss Mariah
have abandoned the mission?

31:57.683 --> 31:58.985
KEISHA:
Hey.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.653
Jess, I thought
we were gonna meet

32:01.753 --> 32:03.055
in your office.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.324
Oh, um...

32:05.424 --> 32:07.759
Hey... Keish.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.897
Andre? What the
hell is going on?

32:12.031 --> 32:13.932
(horn honks)

32:17.536 --> 32:19.605
Oh, my God,
this is a nightmare.

32:20.572 --> 32:21.673
LaDonna?

32:23.009 --> 32:25.011
Just get in.
We...

32:26.412 --> 32:27.846
Please.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.884
Just go.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.423
(car door closes)

32:43.695 --> 32:45.797
REV:
A thank-you to Sister Shanice

32:45.931 --> 32:47.899
for livestreaming our church
to the world.

32:48.034 --> 32:52.304
Since we've arrived here,
we have had cause to worship.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.407
Facing trials put forth
by hateful men

32:55.541 --> 32:57.143
and doubting spirits,
we have conquered

32:57.276 --> 32:58.744
more than most.

32:58.877 --> 33:02.048
Bound by our unique
circumstances, we have all

33:02.148 --> 33:03.982
learned to embrace
the illustrious spirit

33:04.116 --> 33:05.584
of our fellows.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.619
So I say to you all,

33:07.753 --> 33:09.621
let unity be our doctrine

33:09.755 --> 33:11.557
and love our discipline.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.991
(congregation assenting)

33:13.125 --> 33:15.727
But I leave you
with one final message,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.329
both to those 4,400

33:17.463 --> 33:20.266
beyond these walls
and to the world at large.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.237
We, the 4,400,

33:25.337 --> 33:27.005
have been chosen by God.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.807
(congregation assenting)

33:28.940 --> 33:31.843
Ferried by his divine splendor
across the seas of time...

33:31.977 --> 33:33.312
I swear.
...for a cause

33:33.445 --> 33:34.746
bigger than all of us.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.815
Let this hotel be a refuge--

33:36.948 --> 33:40.252
nay, a home-- for all 4,400

33:40.352 --> 33:43.589
that wish to be united
with their brothers and sisters.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.325
And let it be known
that I will provide

33:46.458 --> 33:49.161
for every 4,400
that comes to me.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.430
The government has no latitude

33:51.530 --> 33:54.366
to expel you
from this sanctuary.

33:54.500 --> 33:59.338
We have not just God
but the law on our side.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.940
While those who seek
to harm and divide us

34:02.040 --> 34:04.543
shall be met with the full force
of the strength

34:04.676 --> 34:09.014
that God Almighty
has imparted onto us.
(applause)

34:15.621 --> 34:17.856
JHARREL:
So, I haven't been to church
in a while,

34:17.989 --> 34:20.192
but that seemed kind of ominous.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.495
Well, Rev has a flair
for the dramatics.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.997
Where's Keisha?

34:26.132 --> 34:28.634
Well, believe it or not,
she's on her way to Ypsi Med

34:28.734 --> 34:30.969
to check on
Mildred and Noah.

34:37.008 --> 34:39.044
LOGAN:
All right,
you got her?

34:39.178 --> 34:40.346
Logan?

34:40.479 --> 34:41.313
Mariah?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.048
What is going on?

34:43.182 --> 34:45.317
It's a long story.
Andre,

34:45.417 --> 34:46.885
did you know Mariah
was involved in this?

34:48.587 --> 34:51.157
How could you?
Don't get mad at him.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.724
Okay? All of this
was my idea.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.493
Now, say whatever you
have to say, but please

34:54.593 --> 34:55.994
let us get Mildred inside.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.397
Where's Noah?

34:58.530 --> 35:00.599
There was no time.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.901
Okay, well,
is Mildred gonna be okay?

35:03.034 --> 35:04.770
HAYDEN:
I hope so.

35:04.903 --> 35:08.039
Me, too. But, Hayden, how dare
you endanger Mariah like this?

35:08.174 --> 35:09.608
Did you honestly
think through

35:09.741 --> 35:11.042
what could have happened?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.378
She could have gotten arrested,
or worse.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.745
Okay, that-that's enough.
We all know

35:13.879 --> 35:15.113
what could have happened,
but it didn't.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.782
Because Mariah,

35:16.915 --> 35:18.717
at the first sight of trouble,
called me,

35:18.850 --> 35:20.085
like I raised her to do.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.887
And don't worry,
Mariah's gonna be

35:22.020 --> 35:23.889
very grounded once I have
a long chat with her.

35:24.022 --> 35:25.724
Oh, a chat?
Well, how stern.

35:25.857 --> 35:26.758
Shanice, stop it.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.059
You do not
get a say

35:28.194 --> 35:30.196
in how I raise or
discipline Mariah.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.698
Logan, it was dangerous.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.032
Hayden is from the 1930s.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.534
He doesn't know anything

35:35.634 --> 35:37.769
about this world--
they could have gotten hurt.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.606
You know, I've gotten to know
a courteous...

35:40.739 --> 35:42.241
and kind...

35:42.374 --> 35:44.576
and obviously very
loyal young man.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.278
And while he's
also very grounded,

35:46.412 --> 35:48.280
I'm proud to know
that Mariah has a friend

35:48.414 --> 35:49.915
who's willing to do
the right thing

35:50.048 --> 35:51.583
for those he
cares about.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.220
Now, go check on her.
I'll be waiting in the car.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.824
(car door opens)

35:59.891 --> 36:02.127
(car door closes)

36:07.733 --> 36:10.068
It's so great
to finally meet you.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.771
I had a blast getting to be
an almost-getaway driver.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.073
I'm glad you had fun
while I suffered.

36:16.808 --> 36:20.446
No, I-I'm so sorry. I...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean

36:20.579 --> 36:22.180
to snap at you.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.751
It was just really hard
in there.

36:26.752 --> 36:27.686
Do you...

36:27.819 --> 36:30.121
want to talk about it?

36:31.490 --> 36:33.259
Not now.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.527
Maybe never.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.363
Anyways,

36:37.496 --> 36:39.030
thank you.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.866
Thanks for taking
care of Hayden.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.668
(chuckles):
Oh, I was... I was...

36:42.801 --> 36:44.936
I wasn't really much of a help.
I mean,

36:45.036 --> 36:46.938
I mean, Hayden is
the absolute badass here.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.509
(chuckles softly)
That's what I
always tell him.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.678
He is...

36:52.811 --> 36:55.013
more than capable
of standing on his own.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.715
Right?

37:02.053 --> 37:04.956
SHANICE:
Nice show you put on earlier.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.826
I hope it served its purpose
to provide a sanctuary.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.828
But it wasn't
for show.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.363
I mean what I say.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.733
I'd rather break my back
than abandon my people.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.969
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.806
You're not.
We were just finishing up.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.541
How can we help,
Mr. Greene?

37:22.674 --> 37:23.875
I've been meaning to speak
with you since your sermon.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.977
Seeing as you are
the man to know,

37:26.077 --> 37:27.579
I figured we could talk
about how we

37:27.713 --> 37:28.747
could best aid each other.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.182
I'm all ears.
Wonderful.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.418
Wonderful.
Please.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.019
Ms. Murray.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.728
KEISHA:
Do you know
how many things I've done

37:42.861 --> 37:44.596
that could blow back on me,
personally and professionally,

37:44.730 --> 37:46.732
for trying to cover for you?
What were you thinking,

37:46.865 --> 37:49.234
breaking into Ypsi Med?
You could have been caught.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.337
We deserve an explanation
right now.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.439
And we need to come
up with a game plan
to keep you all safe.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.940
Keep the government from
finding out about your powers.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.743
They already know.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.879
They had specialized cells

38:01.012 --> 38:02.514
used alongside
other tactics

38:02.614 --> 38:04.450
to impede whatever powers
someone had.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.284
Mildred had a hood pressed
over her face

38:06.418 --> 38:07.953
so she couldn't use hers.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.188
No, that can't be right.
Jessica hasn't said anything,

38:10.288 --> 38:11.923
and she works there.
Are you feeling okay?

38:12.057 --> 38:15.093
No, we have
to be missing something.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.128
Now, the government

38:17.262 --> 38:19.465
appears to have some sort
of plan beyond freeing us.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.932
LADONNA:
You guys are
on the inside.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.601
You can help us.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.804
So let's all set our minds
to solving this puzzle.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.906
Together.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.385
OTIS:
Glare

38:39.485 --> 38:40.619
all you want.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.588
While you're staying
under my roof,

38:42.721 --> 38:43.955
I'm gonna learn you
some real discipline.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.291
RUTH:
Don't mind your uncle.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.960
I'll be back faster than
one of your chess games.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.262
But-but I don't want you
to leave at all.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.163
I-I need you.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.499
I'm not leaving forever,

38:53.632 --> 38:54.633
only for a week.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.568
Even if I was,

38:56.668 --> 38:57.836
I'm not worried about you
at all.

38:57.969 --> 38:58.970
Do you want to know why?

38:59.104 --> 39:00.939
Why?

39:01.072 --> 39:03.074
Because you have all the tools

39:03.174 --> 39:05.777
to be on your own and succeed.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.017
(whispers indistinctly)

39:12.150 --> 39:13.785
(laughs)

39:18.524 --> 39:20.158
(closing door echoes)

39:25.531 --> 39:26.865
Should have figured
you'd catch me.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.034
Don't try to stop me.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.436
I...
I wasn't thinking of it.

39:31.437 --> 39:34.473
You can't follow me, either.
I have to do this

39:34.606 --> 39:35.774
on my own.
I know.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.943
That's why I
brought you this.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.846
How did you know?

39:42.347 --> 39:45.050
Look, when I
started this,

39:45.183 --> 39:46.818
I just wanted
to bring you back to me.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.320
I didn't think I could
stand on my own.

39:49.455 --> 39:52.157
I missed how you
made me feel safe.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.625
(laughs softly)

39:53.725 --> 39:55.894
So you planned that whole thing.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.295
I kind of did, huh?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.397
Look, if I try
to keep you here,

39:59.531 --> 40:02.400
it'd be for my needs, not yours.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.203
So please.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.672
Will you be okay?

40:08.373 --> 40:12.878
I have all the tools I need
to be on my own and succeed.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.587
Can you tell me if you see it?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.722
Do I save her?

40:31.663 --> 40:35.066
MILDRED (distorted):
It's this way. Let's go.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.572
I...

40:40.706 --> 40:42.440
I-I don't know.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.175
I can't see anything.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.878
Just be careful.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.080
I will.
