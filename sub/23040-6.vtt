WEBVTT

00:08.480 --> 00:10.800
We are born alone and we die alone.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.760
That's the truth.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.000
You're pregnant?

00:21.960 --> 00:24.600
-Am I the father?
-You don't need to answer that.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.280
-Yes, it's yours.
-We have to talk about this.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.080
-Don't pressure her.
-We have to talk, alone.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.600
Whatever you have to say,
you can say it here.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.320
-Keep out of this.
-Or what?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.440
You've treated her like she was worthless.
You're despicable.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.080
Are you going to tell me how to behave?

00:41.160 --> 00:43.480
-Someone should put you in your place.
-Stop!

00:44.040 --> 00:46.000
I don't want to hear another word.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.520
Nothing you say will change my decision.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.360
I've made up my mind.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.280
I'll take care of my child, on my own.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.880
I don't need you.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.600
What's the point of sharing your life
with someone?

01:04.720 --> 01:07.920
There are many other ways
to feel wanted and loved

01:08.000 --> 01:10.400
without needing a man by your side.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.920
Did you know she was pregnant?

01:23.200 --> 01:26.600
Not too long ago, I thought of you
as a brother. And now look.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.200
Carlos, I love Lidia.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.000
And if she wants to be with me,
I'll care for that child--

01:32.080 --> 01:36.160
No, this child doesn't need a father.
I'm the father. Accept it.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.480
And you have nothing to offer Lidia.
Remember, you're a married man.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.080
She can't raise the child alone.
I'm going to win her back.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.600
I'm sorry, but this is my chance
to finally be with her.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.120
I won't put your happiness before mine.
I won't give up.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.040
Then may the best man win.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.560
But remember that all's fair
in love and war.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.400
Very well.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.600
It's important to realize this
before it's too late,

02:08.680 --> 02:10.639
and to keep alive the bonds of friendship,

02:10.720 --> 02:13.480
so you can lean on someone
when you need to.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.040
Just like I was doing...

02:17.880 --> 02:18.920
with my friends.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.400
My refuge from the bitter loneliness.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.200
Ángeles.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.440
Lidia! I thought I'd never see you again.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.320
I've changed my mind.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.360
I'm staying.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.000
You were right.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.400
No more running away.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.640
No more running away. That's over.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.120
"Witness states he saw
a dark-haired woman dump the car."

03:04.200 --> 03:05.240
Lidia.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.800
I agreed you should leave
because I think you have to go.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.560
-Why?
-Because you're in danger.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.160
A man saw you getting rid of Mario's car.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.920
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

04:23.640 --> 04:25.680
What do you know about the man who saw me?

04:26.520 --> 04:27.920
I don't know anything.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.400
But if he sees you and recognizes you,
we'll have a problem.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.440
No, he won't.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.480
But I need you to keep acting
like you're interested in him.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.560
You must stay close to him
to find out who that witness is.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.640
Will you do that for me?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.560
Of course. I'll do whatever is necessary.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.520
I don't want to get you into trouble.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.120
I won't get into trouble.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.600
We'll find out who that witness is.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.480
Now, more than ever,
I have to fight to stay out of prison.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.120
Carlota, wait! Carlota!

05:07.160 --> 05:08.320
Carlota, forgive me.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
CHAPTER 14: LONELINESS

05:09.480 --> 05:10.480
I...

05:11.240 --> 05:14.440
I wanted to apologize
for judging you the other day.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.360
I don't want to upset you.
I want to help you,

05:17.440 --> 05:19.160
like you've always helped me.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.640
So, if you need to tell me anything,
you know I'm here.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.560
I don't want secrets between us.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.680
Come on.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.160
Where's Sara?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.960
She was supposed
to come back to work today.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.960
-She's not coming.
-Why not? Is she ill?

05:43.040 --> 05:45.360
No, she isn't. Her mother is, and...

05:45.440 --> 05:48.520
She's looking after her,
so she won't be coming for a while.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.360
I can drop by later
and see if she needs anything.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.720
Do you have her address?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.880
No. In fact, I don't remember it.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.720
When you do, tell me.
I have some free time and--

05:57.800 --> 06:01.640
Marga, no! Really, it isn't necessary,
everything's fine. And...

06:01.720 --> 06:04.320
It's a family matter. You needn't bother.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.080
It can't be. It's Lidia.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.400
Lidia? What are you doing here?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.760
I decided to stay.

06:24.680 --> 06:29.640
Thank goodness, Lidia. I was so upset
about all this. That's great.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.840
Don't go crying now. I'll cry, too.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.280
I'm so glad you decided to stay.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.440
You were right, Carlota.
I was running away again.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.960
I'm not letting this pregnancy
separate me from you all.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.200
We'll be there for whatever you need.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.960
That child won't want for anything.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.480
Thanks for always being by my side.
Thank you.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.560
Come here.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.720
Baseball. A ridiculous sport.

07:05.360 --> 07:09.640
What is the fascination in hitting a ball
with a stick? I don't understand.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.200
One doesn't understand sport, Doña Carmen.
One feels it.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.760
-Of course, if you say so.
-Yes.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.120
And, as you see, I'm very busy
right now with this "ridiculous" sport.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.080
So...

07:20.560 --> 07:25.440
As you know, I'm planning
the company's anniversary party.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.760
And?

07:26.840 --> 07:31.560
You'll be happy to know that this morning,
the king confirmed his attendance.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.160
And I'm supposed to believe
he contacted you out of the blue,

07:36.240 --> 07:37.760
and not the other way round?

07:37.840 --> 07:41.560
The eternal question, which came first,
the chicken or the egg?

07:41.880 --> 07:43.400
Another thing.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.000
The king informed me he'd like to see

07:46.080 --> 07:49.080
a prototype of a telephone booth
at the party.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.200
That won't be possible, Doña Carmen.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.160
There isn't enough time.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.160
I'm sorry, but this is no time
for excuses. It's time for action.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.360
Every year, we have presented

08:00.440 --> 08:04.680
the company's latest
technological advances during the party.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.560
If we don't do it this year,
the king will be very disappointed.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.320
So... I'll leave you to your little ball.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.560
Pablo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, forgive me.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.440
-Marga, an hour and a half.
-I...

08:32.520 --> 08:35.000
I was waiting for an hour and a half
at the church.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.799
-Maybe you don't care about our wedding.
-Of course I do. A lot.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.960
But I've got a thousand things on my mind
and I forgot.

08:42.039 --> 08:45.760
So, is the San Antonio Church
the ideal place for us to get married?

08:45.840 --> 08:48.120
Yes, but we can't do it there
for at least a year.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.440
-Why?
-The people in the capital are insane.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.680
They plan weddings
a year or two in advance.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.560
I knew it.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.720
-Well, we'll have to keep looking.
-Yes.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.520
-But you're coming with me.
-Yes.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.120
-I don't want to go on my own.
-Don't get angry, Pablo. I was...

09:06.680 --> 09:09.920
Well! Trouble in paradise?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.760
What are you doing here?

09:12.840 --> 09:16.320
-I'm a telephone operator now.
-What?

09:17.320 --> 09:20.240
My father is still recuperating
and he can't work,

09:20.320 --> 09:24.480
so I had to find a job
to help my family and I thought,

09:24.560 --> 09:27.760
"Why don't I leave my résumé
at the Telephone Company?"

09:27.840 --> 09:29.520
And they called me.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.880
This must be a mistake.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.400
No, not at all. Look.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.280
I start tomorrow.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.480
-Aren't you pleased, Marga?
-Smile in the face of adversity.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.880
Excuse me, did you say something?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.800
No, not at all.

09:47.480 --> 09:51.440
Well, we'll have a great time together,
won't we?

10:01.320 --> 10:03.600
You sounded very nervous on the phone.

10:03.920 --> 10:08.080
I guess you didn't call me
so we could have a chat and a cigarette.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.360
When I gave you proof your mother
was stealing from the foundation...

10:12.320 --> 10:14.240
I said I'd want repayment someday.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.600
Something tells me that day has come.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.640
What do you want?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.760
A marriage annulment.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.120
-And I want it now.
-Well...

10:25.680 --> 10:27.480
it seems you're in a hurry.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.480
I just want to put an end to this,
so we'll both be free.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.760
You can go about your life, and so can I.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.000
Very well, I'll sign the annulment.
But I warn you,

10:37.080 --> 10:40.720
however much you try,
you have no future with Lidia.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.040
-You lied to her, tricked her...
-Elisa, that's my business.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.800
You just sign the annulment.

10:57.040 --> 11:00.280
Marga, I need you to cover for me
for a while.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.240
-I have to sort something out.
-Is it Sara?

11:03.320 --> 11:06.720
No, it's Miguel. He hasn't come to work.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.120
-Should I go with you?
-No, don't worry.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.680
I'll be all right.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.040
Yes?

11:24.120 --> 11:26.920
Inspector Cuevas, it's me, Ángeles.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.040
Mrs. Vidal, I wasn't expecting your call.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.720
I need to speak to you.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.960
Go ahead. What's it about?

11:37.040 --> 11:41.160
Well, I'd like to tell you in person.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.840
Could you come to my house tonight?

11:45.520 --> 11:47.560
I don't think
that's a good idea, Mrs. Vidal.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.720
I think it's important
that we clarify things...

11:51.520 --> 11:54.360
especially after what happened.
Don't you think?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.120
Please, Cristóbal.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.840
I'd feel better.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.520
It isn't right to leave things like this.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.840
Okay. 10:00 at your house.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.160
I told you I'd manage it.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.800
Here.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.560
-What's this?
-A sleeping pill.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.360
Put it in his drink and you can
steal his keys without any risk.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.120
He'll fall asleep and tomorrow,
when he wakes up,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.360
he won't remember a thing.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.640
And we'll have all the details
on the witness.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.760
Wait in the meeting room. See you later?

12:40.720 --> 12:41.600
Good.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.320
Sara?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.000
When did you get here?

13:06.280 --> 13:08.840
You couldn't even answer the phone?

13:11.080 --> 13:14.040
-Did it ring?
-What's wrong with you?

13:14.720 --> 13:18.040
I've been worried all morning
waiting for news of Sara.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.880
Sara this, Sara that...

13:23.960 --> 13:25.920
Is this what you've been doing all day?

13:26.440 --> 13:27.800
Smoking God knows what shit.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.720
You promised me you wouldn't use it again.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.760
Will you take care of me
like you do for her?

13:35.520 --> 13:38.520
I can't believe
you're so cowardly and selfish,

13:38.600 --> 13:40.640
doing all this to get attention.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.280
If you want to destroy yourself, go ahead.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.680
If you want to fall into the abyss,
do it, but I won't pull you out.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.920
I've done that once before.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.000
Sara, have you filled out those forms?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.760
Yes, and here's the consent form
the nurse gave me.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.400
I see you're getting settled in.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.040
I'm delighted.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.160
You've made the best possible decision.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.760
-I hope so.
-Of course.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.600
-We'll start the treatment soon and...
-Treatment?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.680
What do you mean, treatment?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.320
You never mentioned treatment.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.640
Patients come here looking for a solution.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.880
Haven't you come here to be cured?

14:31.560 --> 14:34.400
To be cured? I'm not sick.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.280
I don't like calling it "being sick."
I prefer to call it "a deviation."

14:39.280 --> 14:43.400
I'm sorry,
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.880
No, there hasn't.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.720
Based on our discussion and your case,
this place is right for you.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.520
But I came here looking for answers,
nothing more.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.840
I don't want to be treated.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
You didn't say this in the consultation.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.560
Don't worry.

14:59.640 --> 15:02.080
It's normal to be scared,
but you shouldn't worry.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.040
You're in very good hands.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.920
Medicine has made great advances.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.400
It will all go well.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.640
Sit down.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.960
You've signed the consent form,
so you're under my care now.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.960
I'll decide when you can leave.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.720
You can't hold me here against my will.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.240
Believe me, Sara,
it's best for you and everyone.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.760
Wait, please!

15:35.840 --> 15:39.320
No, no, no! Listen, no!

15:40.800 --> 15:43.400
You can't leave me here! Please!

15:46.360 --> 15:49.000
Miss Aguilar, please take a seat.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.080
We don't have much time.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.920
I sent for you so urgently
because we need to move ahead

15:57.000 --> 15:59.520
with the public telephones project.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.280
I want to see a prototype

16:01.360 --> 16:04.280
to show to the king
at the company's anniversary party.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.080
I'm sorry, this year it won't be possible.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.040
We still have to do the design
and confirm details with the engineers.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.440
Good, I see you're clear
about how to proceed.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.640
You have two days.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.360
-That won't be possible.
-Was I wrong to put my trust in you?

16:20.960 --> 16:23.800
With all due respect, Mr. Uribe,
I think that...

16:24.640 --> 16:27.880
it's insane. We don't know
which project is going ahead

16:27.960 --> 16:30.480
and we can't build two prototypes.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.480
I have something to say.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.280
I'm withdrawing from the competition.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.240
I stole the idea from Lidia.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.560
In my office.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.840
In my office, now.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.640
You're a scoundrel.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.920
I made it clear, I want no thieves here.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.160
I'm sorry about what happened.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.160
But I felt betrayed by her,

17:01.240 --> 17:04.000
and stealing the project
was my perfect chance for revenge.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.800
Are you kidding me?

17:06.400 --> 17:10.240
You're obviously in love with that girl.
What are you talking about?

17:11.319 --> 17:13.040
Mr. Cifuentes...

17:14.359 --> 17:15.839
don't play games with me.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.200
What changed overnight
for you to confess it all now?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.440
Lidia is pregnant with my child.

17:32.240 --> 17:36.120
So you can relax,
I won't keep up this fight.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.200
Oh, my God.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.960
Oh, my God.

17:43.040 --> 17:46.440
Fine, now's not the time
to lose either of you.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.800
I need that project now.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.760
After the presentation for the king,
I'll make a decision.

17:51.840 --> 17:52.840
Thank you.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.320
Why did you do that in the meeting?

18:09.320 --> 18:10.960
I want to start over.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.000
I want us to forget past mistakes.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.120
Lidia, I love you
and I want to be with you.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.480
Let's raise this child together.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.680
I'd be an idiot to trust you again.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.080
I was a bastard.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.560
I got carried away by bitterness,
I did things I'm ashamed of...

18:37.720 --> 18:40.720
but you didn't tell me who you were.
And now this.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.560
Lidia.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.040
I'm willing to forget it all
for that child.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.120
Where did you get that?

18:59.520 --> 19:03.640
I pretended to sell it at the auction.
I wanted to teach you a lesson.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.920
I don't know who I was trying to fool.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.000
I love you, Lidia.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.480
Please, give me another chance.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.800
I have to think about it.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.880
That's much more
than I could have hoped for.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.120
Carlos, wait.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.000
I'm in no mood for sermons.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.640
How dare you back out of the competition?

19:50.720 --> 19:53.960
It was our only way
of regaining control of the company.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.120
And all for that hussy.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
Don't call her that.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.240
Lidia is expecting my child.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.520
What?

20:10.080 --> 20:12.800
And I won't stop until I get her back.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.240
Acknowledging that child would be
the biggest mistake of your life.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.600
Should I pretend it doesn't exist?

20:20.680 --> 20:23.680
-Think what people will say.
-I don't give a damn.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.000
Well, you should.

20:25.080 --> 20:29.080
Must I remind you that she's a fraud,
that's she's broken the law?

20:29.160 --> 20:32.800
She's the woman I love.
Stop treating me as if I were a child.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.000
I've made a decision.
I'm not backing down.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.760
We'll start a family,
whether you like it or not.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
You'll choose him.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.920
You're going to stay with Carlos.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.120
I thought you wanted to be with me.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.400
-This is our last chance to be together.
-I thought that, too, Francisco.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.080
Until I learned
I was expecting Carlos' child.

21:11.720 --> 21:15.440
And now I don't know,
because nothing is the same.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.640
Do you really think
he'll look after you and that baby?

21:23.400 --> 21:26.520
-After how he's hurt you?
-I hurt him, too.

21:26.600 --> 21:31.080
I stole the Rotary
and I lied to him from the start.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.160
I broke his heart, too, Francisco.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.000
It isn't that simple.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.880
Yes, it is.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.960
You just have to choose who you love...

21:45.840 --> 21:46.720
him or me.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.080
You'll always be my first great love.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.200
And you're a part of me.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.800
When you left, I thought that
I could never fall in love again, until...

22:07.480 --> 22:09.000
until he came along.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.040
I have to think about
what's best for my child.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.600
And you're a married man.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.760
But not for long, Lidia.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.600
Elisa and I are going to sign
a marriage annulment.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.120
Lidia, stay with me, please. Stay.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.040
I can give you and your child
everything you want.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.160
Please.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.960
I'm sorry.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.720
I have to think. I need to be alone.

23:15.960 --> 23:16.800
Hello.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.160
I thought you wouldn't come.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.400
And I shouldn't have.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.320
Come in.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.320
I wanted to talk about the other day.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.640
That was a mistake
and it won't happen again.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.160
I've come to tell you that from now on,
our relationship is purely professional.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.880
Why?

23:44.440 --> 23:45.400
I did nothing.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.400
What more can I do to prove it?

23:48.480 --> 23:49.520
Nothing.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.120
I'm investigating
your husband's disappearance.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.960
I won't stop until it's solved.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
Mario.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.640
-Mario!
-Are you all right?

23:58.720 --> 24:01.040
-Mario.
-What about him?

24:01.960 --> 24:05.200
I saw Mario. He was in the mirror.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.880
Mario was in the mirror?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.680
I swear he was. I saw him in the mirror.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.920
But that's impossible. Mario isn't...

24:13.000 --> 24:14.360
Why is it impossible?

24:14.440 --> 24:16.800
Talk to me. Why is it impossible?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.840
Calm down. You can trust me.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.320
Ángeles.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.960
Thank you.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.640
When this is all over,
I don't want to give this up.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.560
I don't want to.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.880
Because I want you.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.680
I want you more than
I've ever wanted anyone before.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.600
Don't worry, dear,
this time I come in peace.

25:12.840 --> 25:17.360
I think we're both old enough to know
it's impossible to speak of peace.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.760
I know you're expecting my son's child.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.960
If you've come to insult me--

25:25.040 --> 25:28.480
Don't worry, I don't need
to have you near to insult you.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.920
I've come to propose something.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.040
Don't tell me
you want to attend the baptism.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.320
I'll give you a lot of money
if you go far away.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.480
I'm not going anywhere.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.400
I know where I want to be, and it's here.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.280
And neither you nor your money
will stop that.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.960
Very well. You don't want to leave.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.160
But we both know the child
you're carrying is a mistake.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.680
And mistakes can be rectified.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.720
You want me to get rid of it?

26:04.040 --> 26:06.000
Yes, it's best for everyone.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.960
Maybe for your son,

26:08.040 --> 26:11.040
and for the good of your family name,
or am I wrong?

26:11.120 --> 26:15.040
You're completely wrong.
You're the one who'd benefit most.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.560
Don't you think it's too much?

26:17.640 --> 26:20.280
Running the company, your child...

26:20.360 --> 26:23.560
Anyone with half a brain

26:23.640 --> 26:27.400
knows that's aiming too high for a woman.

26:27.920 --> 26:33.680
Accept my money, get rid of that child,
and carry on with your dreams.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.640
That's enough for today.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.320
Hey, honey. What is it?

27:40.400 --> 27:42.200
-I don't know.
-It's good news, right?

27:42.280 --> 27:43.880
Yes, the best.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.040
I thought of us not getting married,
and I got so anxious...

27:47.120 --> 27:49.520
Not getting married?
Are you having doubts?

27:49.600 --> 27:53.080
-No, Pablo, it's not that...
-Then what?

27:53.160 --> 27:56.560
Sometimes I feel like
our relationship is cursed.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.440
-Cursed?
-Yes.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.800
Cursed, yes.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.360
As soon as we meet, Marisol turns up.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.680
When we shake her off, she comes along
with the sick father story.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.840
And now she's going to work
at the company.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.000
Not to mention
your hiccup in the groin area.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.800
Hey, that's no hiccup.
Lots of men have it.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.880
I assure you, I'll take care of it.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.480
Coming.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.760
Coming.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.440
Coming!

28:27.600 --> 28:28.760
Carlota?

28:28.840 --> 28:34.360
Sorry, I didn't know you were with Pablo.
I didn't mean to bother you.

28:34.440 --> 28:37.680
No, I was just leaving.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.680
Yes.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.760
-Good night.
-Good night.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.840
Carlota, what happened?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.160
It's...

28:54.080 --> 28:55.440
It's Sara...

28:56.320 --> 28:57.680
It's Miguel and...

28:58.160 --> 28:59.560
It's everything.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.280
I lied to you this morning.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.440
Sara's not with her mother.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.080
Where is she?

29:08.120 --> 29:11.200
-I can't...
-Oh, Carlota, come here.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.280
Come here.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.640
Calm down. Calm down.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.840
It'll all be fine.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.120
Calm down.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.280
Do you have them?

29:33.280 --> 29:34.320
Okay.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.280
I'll bring them back before he wakes up.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.120
-You put the sleeping pill in his wine?
-Yes.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.840
Good. You have nothing to worry about.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.200
Not even the end of the world
would wake him up.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.240
Everything running smoothly?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.520
Yes, yes, like silk.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.920
Good.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.680
We'd gone too far
to leave our fate up to chance.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.920
Now we had to reach the end.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.920
"Basilio García Serrano.
3 Santa Ana Street."

31:17.520 --> 31:20.040
Don't tell me you've had second thoughts.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.400
I want to negotiate.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.040
How can I help you?

31:35.640 --> 31:39.000
I thought it over,
and I think you're right.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.320
This pregnancy has been
a problem for everyone.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.960
It wasn't planning
to become a mother right now.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.640
It makes no sense to sacrifice
my dreams for a mistake.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.240
A wise decision,
but I thought I hadn't convinced you.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.720
If you think this doesn't hurt...

32:00.920 --> 32:03.720
When do you think
we can settle this matter?

32:04.760 --> 32:06.480
After the anniversary party.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.560
I know of a place
where it can be done discreetly,

32:09.640 --> 32:12.640
but the woman needs payment in advance.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.200
How much do you need?

32:15.680 --> 32:16.760
Yes, that's it!

32:16.840 --> 32:18.640
-Doña Lola took care of it all?
-Yes.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.800
My God, I'd make
that woman the maid of honor,

32:21.880 --> 32:23.400
but my mom would kill me.

32:23.480 --> 32:26.440
At last, the wedding I've dreamed of.
The curse is over.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.840
There's no curse!
We're getting married!

32:28.920 --> 32:30.600
Who's getting married?

32:32.360 --> 32:33.560
-We are.
-We are.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.720
May 28th, at La Paz Parish Church.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.200
What, aren't you glad?

32:41.600 --> 32:44.320
Good news on your first day
as a cable girl.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.680
Yes, of course, the best.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.080
Well, I'm leaving.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.240
Yes.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.440
See you later.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.520
Hey, Marisol.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.360
To show you there's no hard feelings,
you're invited.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.600
You can read something,
or be the ring bearer, whatever you want.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.280
-You tell me what you want.
-Yes.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.320
Have a good day.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.080
Excuse me, I'm not only new to the job,
but to the city as well.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.640
I don't know where
La Paz Parish Church is,

33:25.720 --> 33:28.640
and I need to speak
to the parish priest urgently.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.280
Lidia, how did it go with Doña Carmen?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.120
Fine.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.120
I just closed the deal.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.840
She fell for it.

33:43.920 --> 33:47.120
She thinks I'm getting an abortion.
We'll have the money tomorrow.

33:47.920 --> 33:52.320
Now we find the witness
and carry on with the plan.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.160
Are you sure it's the best thing?

33:58.440 --> 34:00.240
I haven't the slightest doubt.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.160
With that money,
we'll buy the witness's silence.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.040
Operator 48, how can I help you?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.440
Carlota, is that you?

34:16.520 --> 34:20.199
Sara! Why didn't you call me?
I was going crazy. Are you all right?

34:22.760 --> 34:25.080
No, I'm not all right.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.600
This place isn't what it seems.

34:27.679 --> 34:31.040
What's going on?
What do you need? Tell me.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.360
You have to get me out of here.

34:34.720 --> 34:38.400
As soon as possible, Carlota.
You have to come. Please.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.760
Sara? Sara?

34:42.520 --> 34:46.120
I thought I told you.
No personal calls during your treatment.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.239
What's happened, Carlota? Was it Sara?

34:51.320 --> 34:53.280
Yes, it was Sara.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.760
I told you I felt something wasn't right.
I had a bad feeling, and I wasn't wrong.

34:58.520 --> 35:02.280
She couldn't even speak.
I have to get her out of there.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.400
This is crazy.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.160
If you don't want to help me,
I understand. It's fine.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.400
Carlota, I'm going to help you.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.800
But we need help. We can't do it alone.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.040
Girls...

35:14.840 --> 35:18.440
Sara's going through
a tough time in her life because...

35:19.560 --> 35:25.400
she's not sure who she is,
and she wanted to see a professional.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.320
So she went to see this doctor.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.960
I hadn't heard from her
since she went into that place.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.920
But today, she called me,
desperately asking for help.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.960
I don't know what's happening,
but I fear it's not good.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.800
I just want to get her out of there.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.720
That's why we need your help.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.840
Carlota, I know you're fond of Sara,
that you're great friends,

35:44.920 --> 35:46.000
but this is very risky.

35:46.080 --> 35:49.560
Sara took risks for us, too.
We owe it to her.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.520
What do you mean, Carlota?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.080
Well...

35:57.600 --> 36:00.960
Sara helped us
by leaving Mario's hat on the train.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.880
What?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.240
Oh, my God, Carlota.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.120
Sara knows about Mario?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.520
How could you tell her about Mario?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.440
What did you want me to do?
No, listen.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.440
I was at home, crying and bloodstained,
and she walked in on me.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.600
I had no choice but to confess.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.560
I believe in her.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.760
She helped us shake off the police.
We're safe, aren't we?

36:22.400 --> 36:25.120
I think that's reason enough to trust her.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.920
All right, girls. Sara helped us.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.560
Now she's having a tough time
and we have to return the favor.

36:32.640 --> 36:35.680
We'll do it tonight.
There will be less surveillance.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.560
At 9:00 at the front gate.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.120
Inspector.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.040
-Can we talk?
-Of course. Of course, come in.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.920
-Alex, if you'll excuse us.
-Sure, I'll leave you two alone.

36:55.400 --> 36:58.640
-How are you?
-Actually, I wanted you to meet someone.

37:02.440 --> 37:06.200
As I said, Miss Moreno has full knowledge
of the company's dealings.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.720
She was secretary
to the late Mr. Cifuentes for years.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.200
To what do I owe the honor of meeting her?

37:13.360 --> 37:16.160
Carolina has cooperated with the police
from the beginning.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.080
She's been a big help.

37:18.160 --> 37:22.000
Yes, in fact, I knew Mario personally.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.320
Then I thank you.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.440
But I don't quite get
the reason for your visit.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.680
Well, I...

37:30.360 --> 37:33.200
I'd like to get my job back and--

37:33.280 --> 37:36.520
We thought that her efforts
to solve the case could be rewarded.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.920
Frankly, Inspector, this is rather bold.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.960
And I don't see
what your role is in all this.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.720
Maybe you might consider
that recovering the stolen money

37:48.360 --> 37:50.280
merits a second chance.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.880
-Is that the money he took?
-It is.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.680
Mario had a kind of debt with Miss Moreno.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.200
We think that's why he stole it.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.480
The girl's not involved?

38:06.560 --> 38:08.520
No, I had nothing to do with it.

38:09.440 --> 38:13.480
When I found out about the theft,
I took the money straight to the police.

38:13.560 --> 38:16.080
We held onto the money.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.320
We didn't want news of it
to interfere with the investigation.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.120
-So, you've found this...
-Mario? No.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.280
On the contrary,
the case has gotten more complicated.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.200
Complicated?

38:30.280 --> 38:33.280
I can't give you any more details.
The case is still open,

38:33.960 --> 38:36.560
but we have no reason
to hold onto this money any longer.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.200
I understand that you can't give me
further explanations.

38:40.400 --> 38:44.040
But I'm worried about
this company's reputation.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.880
I guess I'll have to find out
in the papers.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.440
I'm very grateful
for your honesty, Miss...

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
Carolina.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.840
Carolina. I'm sorry I doubted you.

38:53.920 --> 38:58.080
It doesn't matter,
if that means I'll get my job back.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.360
A determined woman.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.680
All right, I'll give you a chance.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.320
Thank you, Mr. Uribe.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.000
You won't regret it.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.600
I hope not.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.040
"It was you."

39:41.760 --> 39:43.560
What are you doing?

39:43.640 --> 39:45.400
-It's you.
-What's all this?

39:45.480 --> 39:47.040
-Is it you?
-What's this about?

39:47.120 --> 39:49.480
It was you all this time.
Don't act crazy with me.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.560
-Don't play dumb!
-What?

39:51.640 --> 39:54.800
You're trying to make me think I'm crazy!

39:54.880 --> 39:57.160
Making me believe
that Mario's following me!

39:57.960 --> 39:59.200
God.

40:01.080 --> 40:04.800
You come to my place
and tell me Mario's here,

40:04.880 --> 40:07.360
you purposely leave his lighter behind,

40:07.440 --> 40:11.360
then you make that anonymous call...

40:11.440 --> 40:14.320
Now, to top it off,
you write something in my locker.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.600
Admit it, Carolina! Please, admit it.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.600
It's you.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.000
Look, stop it. Stop it.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.960
What's wrong with you?

40:26.840 --> 40:29.840
Why are so worried that Mario's
trying to contact you?

40:30.800 --> 40:33.000
What are you hiding, Ángeles?

40:35.280 --> 40:38.320
Come on, tell me what you did to him.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.440
What did you do to him?

40:52.160 --> 40:53.000
Leave her alone.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.760
Just what I need.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.520
It's been a long time, Lidia.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.200
I told you to leave her alone.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.880
Don't tell me
you're mixed up in this, too?

41:06.600 --> 41:09.200
Last time you got in my way,
it didn't go well for you.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.720
I thought you'd learned your lesson.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.640
Go.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.160
Girls, one other little thing I forgot.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.080
I'm not letting this slide.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.960
I know you're hiding something
and I'm going to expose it.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.480
Hello! Good evening.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.600
-Good evening.
-Sorry to bother you.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.720
Go ahead, it's no trouble.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.720
-My husband got a flat tire...
-Oh, geez.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.720
a mile or so back,
on the road to Navacerrada and...

41:58.800 --> 42:02.880
The flat's fixed,
but you can't see a thing in the dark.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.520
Could you tell us the way?

42:04.600 --> 42:08.120
Of course, ladies,
but it's a bit far away.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.240
Here's number nine.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.040
Sara? Sara!

43:22.440 --> 43:25.840
When a person is alone,
they are very vulnerable.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.240
We have to get her out.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.360
We're getting you out of here.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.520
God.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.440
Pain, fear, weakness...

43:36.000 --> 43:37.080
Here.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.280
It all grows when one is alone.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.280
Someone's coming.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.560
Girls, let's get out of here, fast.

43:50.640 --> 43:55.320
That's why we have to act
like a pack fighting for its survival.

43:57.120 --> 44:00.640
We must disregard
our individual motivations

44:00.720 --> 44:03.840
to overcome the dangers awaiting us.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.520
Sara, what's wrong?

44:11.600 --> 44:12.480
Sara!
