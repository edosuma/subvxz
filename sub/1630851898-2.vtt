00:05.040 --> 00:06.800
It's not like I'm just
doing stand-up comedy in one hall

00:06.880 --> 00:08.920
and it went bad and okay,
nobody found out.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.160
I'm doing it and it will
be there on Amazon Prime forever.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.000
My grandkids can see.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.960
So, that's a little scary.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.960
Hi! I'm your host and part-time
traffic abuse expert, Sapan Verma

00:56.040 --> 00:57.920
and this is One Mic Stand.

00:58.000 --> 00:58.800
On today's episode,

00:58.880 --> 01:01.960
we have two entertaining
and effervescent personalities.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.280
Celebrity guest who's India's
best-selling author, Chetan Bhagat,

01:05.440 --> 01:08.040
and a stand-up comedian
who can easily steal my job

01:08.120 --> 01:10.360
as the host of this show, Abish Mathew.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.720
You guys are all educated here.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.400
Educated audience, make some noise.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.840
Yeah! That's lovely!

01:16.680 --> 01:18.680
How many letters in the English alphabet?

01:19.360 --> 01:20.160
Twenty-six.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.280
Twenty-six.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.280
That's right. That's what they told us.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.680
But they taught us
like there were thirty-one.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.080
If you don't know what I'm talking about,

01:29.720 --> 01:31.160
why don't you join me?

01:32.520 --> 01:33.520
Everybody…

01:34.680 --> 01:38.920
A B C D E F G

01:39.520 --> 01:43.440
H I J K L M N O P

01:44.000 --> 01:47.880
L M N O P Q R S T

01:48.000 --> 01:50.360
U V W X Y…

01:50.440 --> 01:52.720
Why are there two LMNOP's?

01:53.880 --> 01:57.520
What did LMNOP do
to be in our alphabet twice?

01:58.520 --> 02:02.320
What's strange is that
an entire population,

02:02.400 --> 02:04.880
the first time we sing LMNOP,

02:04.960 --> 02:06.800
they're five different letters.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.200
But the second time around…

02:09.920 --> 02:11.320
it's a Punjabi phrase.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.960
It's allo-mano-pi.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.280
Comicstaan!

02:24.120 --> 02:25.040
Just…

02:25.120 --> 02:28.120
It sounds like the way I learnt ABCD,

02:28.160 --> 02:29.400
Ritviz wrote it.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.600
True story. I failed LKG.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.120
Because when my teachers
had asked me how many letters,

02:36.160 --> 02:38.120
I kept saying thirty-one.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.760
I failed LKG.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.000
So much so, my dad officially
changed my name from Abish George Mathew

02:46.600 --> 02:48.000
to Abish Mathew.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.800
That's the closest
I've gotten to an abortion.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.560
You guys fans of watching cricket,
for example?

02:59.240 --> 03:00.480
Right. So you remember,

03:00.560 --> 03:03.120
almost a decade ago, IPL was launched.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.240
But when IPL came in,
it brought with itself

03:06.440 --> 03:08.720
a technological revolution.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.880
And that was called

03:11.160 --> 03:15.600
the s…uper…

03:15.680 --> 03:22.480
s…l…ow motio…n came…ra…

03:23.120 --> 03:26.600
Which is way better
than slow-motion camera.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.880
Cause in super-slow-motion camera,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.600
you get to see inside
the cricketer's soul.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.000
Every micro-body expression enhanced!

03:37.120 --> 03:39.480
But the best thing I had seen was…

03:39.560 --> 03:42.120
one of our finest captains,
Mahendra Singh Dhoni,

03:42.440 --> 03:44.040
catch a ball behind the wicket.

03:44.120 --> 03:44.920
It was very sweet.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.640
Like, he went regular--
You know how it's on regular TV.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.840
Where he went…

03:50.040 --> 03:52.000
"Howzzat!"

03:52.560 --> 03:54.840
Now, before that,
they immediately kicked in

03:54.920 --> 04:00.440
the super-slow-motion…

04:01.200 --> 04:05.160
when I saw Mahendra Singh Dhoni
at 1000 frames per second

04:05.240 --> 04:10.600
on a 4K television,
each micro-body expression enhanced.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.040
I saw him go…

04:20.960 --> 04:24.360
Leave it to me!

05:07.720 --> 05:12.120
Don't throw the ball!

05:12.440 --> 05:17.120
No!

05:40.480 --> 05:45.600
Howzzat?!

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
Alright, you guys have been fantastic.
Thank you very much!

05:48.360 --> 05:49.680
My name is Abish Mathew.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.520
Have a good one!

05:55.160 --> 05:56.040
Hi!

05:56.160 --> 05:57.640
-Hello! Greetings!
-Hi.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.640
-Welcome to One Mic Stand.
-Good, good.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.880
I have a five-star driver today.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.280
You have a five-star driver
who has not driven a car

06:03.360 --> 06:05.360
in two and a half years in Bombay.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.560
Where's my coach?

06:09.840 --> 06:10.720
We're going to your coach.

06:10.840 --> 06:11.720
Your mentor…

06:11.960 --> 06:13.720
-Yeah.
-Abish Mathew. We're driving to him.

06:13.880 --> 06:14.680
A lot of your books,

06:14.760 --> 06:16.800
-people sell pirated on the signals.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.760
Have you bought your own book?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.600
-Yes, I've put up a video.
-Yeah?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.320
It was like, basically, I…

06:22.520 --> 06:24.600
asked the guy,
"Do you have Chetan Bhagat's book?"

06:24.680 --> 06:25.640
He was selling my own book.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.240
And I saw it was one of my books.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.840
I said, "Which one is this?"
He said, "This is Chetan Bhagat's."

06:29.000 --> 06:31.120
I asked, "How is it?
People say he's not a good writer."

06:31.920 --> 06:34.800
So, "No, no, sir. This sells well.
I sell it every day."

06:35.000 --> 06:36.680
Then I did take it from him
and I did pay him.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.520
But you don't put your
photo on the back of the book?

06:39.160 --> 06:41.520
I do. And then he recognized me.
No, then I shook hands with him.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.520
The video shows me saying,
"Hey, it's me."

06:43.600 --> 06:44.440
"Oh, sir!"

06:44.520 --> 06:46.680
-So, there's that wonderful reaction.
-Funny.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.640
Come on. We are here. We've reached.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.320
-Let us go and meet Mr. Abish Mathew.
-Hi!

06:55.400 --> 06:57.440
-What's up? Abish.
-Oh! Oh!

06:57.680 --> 06:58.680
He's my guru, right?

06:58.760 --> 06:59.800
-Already so…
-Yes, that is true.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.520
You are blessed.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.000
May you be mediocrely funny like me.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.960
-Okay, that would be good enough.
-That's a great tip for the flight back.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.280
So, where do you see yourself
in comedy in five years?

07:09.360 --> 07:11.640
I've come to learn,
not to give a job interview.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.680
But yes…

07:13.280 --> 07:16.120
See, I have this problem of
this fake overconfidence.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.960
I've always had it.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.800
And I think it's a compensatory mechanism.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.400
If you are actually scared,
just say, "No, no.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.880
It'll go well. Everything will be fine."

07:24.120 --> 07:25.360
You remember DDLJ?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.120
It's an old movie for you guys.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.080
-No, no. It's pretty much…
-It's pretty--

07:29.160 --> 07:32.480
So, in that movie, Shahrukh goes and
meets that friend Kuldeep or whatever.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.640
-Oh, yeah.
-And he says,

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
"Man, I want to set up a factory."

07:34.800 --> 07:37.120
And he replies, "Consider it set up.
It's done."

07:37.480 --> 07:38.560
-Yeah.
-So, I'm a bit like that.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.560
Sure, I'll get it done.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.080
Also, I was very interested to see

07:41.160 --> 07:43.040
how you go about doing comedy, right?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.440
Because you're instinctively funny.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.360
I want to see
how that translates on stage.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.720
So, the point is that
I can edit books for weeks.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.360
I can plot them, I can see and--

07:51.520 --> 07:52.840
But doing it non-stop--

07:53.000 --> 07:54.400
In a book, I have 300 pages.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.320
So, if you have one
joke after three-four pages also

07:56.400 --> 07:57.400
people say it's a funny book.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.600
-Right. Yeah.
-Whereas…

07:58.680 --> 07:59.560
Stand-up is different.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.160
Stand-up, it's like you
have to keep that momentum going.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.640
So, this is scary.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.600
And if the purpose of this
meeting was to make it less scary,

08:08.920 --> 08:10.760
-That's not happened?
-then it's had the opposite effect.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.840
It's scarier I think, in a sense, when I…

08:12.920 --> 08:14.640
Now that you tell me, and--

08:14.720 --> 08:15.600
Because it's…

08:15.840 --> 08:19.080
People just feel that
this guy is making them laugh.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.640
He's so funny.
You know, he's a "jolly person"!

08:21.840 --> 08:23.840
-Jolly! That's such a…
-He's "jolly".

08:23.960 --> 08:25.560
-I haven't heard that in so long.
-He's a "jolly guy".

08:25.640 --> 08:26.800
"Jolly" people…

08:27.040 --> 08:29.480
But they don't realize there's
some work involved in this.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.960
-He's such a funny guy.
-Funny guy. Makes you laugh.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.120
You mentioned something very interesting.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.280
You mentioned that there's Indian English,
and there's a different, like…

08:36.360 --> 08:38.960
Your English, and there's other,
different English books in India.

08:39.040 --> 08:39.880
What is the difference?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.320
Language is not a tool
to discriminate against people.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.640
Language is fluid.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.640
Today, if me and five other
writers like me change the way we write,

08:49.720 --> 08:51.480
and if that's how people read and talk,

08:52.040 --> 08:53.520
language will change.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.840
English was not English.
It used to be Latin.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.600
Somebody made…

08:57.640 --> 08:59.880
Some Chetan Bhagat in Latin made English.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.000
Because it was simpler.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.440
It was Chetan Bhagat
in the Shakespeare era!

09:04.520 --> 09:05.480
And they must have made fun of him.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.640
Yeah, exactly.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.640
I was just like, "Man!"

09:07.760 --> 09:09.840
Shakespeare was Chetan Bhagat!

09:10.240 --> 09:11.200
Man, you know what,

09:11.280 --> 09:13.520
-this out of context…
-This is a meme.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.720
-What is popular is always frowned upon.
-Criticized.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.880
Ask anybody. Was Shakespeare
frowned upon in his time or not?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.840
And he was.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.240
I'll give you an example in comedy itself.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.520
You know, when comedy started
happening initially in the country,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.160
it was all English comedy, right?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.000
And there were a lot
of Hindi comedians coming

09:29.080 --> 09:30.640
and you could see English
comedians be like,

09:30.760 --> 09:31.720
"Oh, this is not comedy."

09:31.880 --> 09:34.080
Now if you look at Hindi comedy,
it's so complex.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.040
There's great storytelling.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.400
Now they're doing really well.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.520
You see that shift.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.600
-So, I get what you mean.
-What you say, matters.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.960
-Not the language.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.720
Any tip that you have
to give him for this?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.000
Yeah, I say this
all the time to everybody.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.640
Now, for example, these are…

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
It's gonna get technical now, okay?

09:47.880 --> 09:50.000
…three cups, okay,
of three different things.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.360
Now, one is your writing.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.760
One is your performance.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.880
One is your personality.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.480
Lot of people say that the joke
is complete with writing and performance.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.240
No. Personality gives context.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.720
You need to see what level
you want to add for what…

10:02.840 --> 10:05.360
For example, for me, I know that…

10:05.520 --> 10:08.160
For me, I'm a much funnier
personality than my joke writing.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.160
It's much worse.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.960
But my performance is good.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.880
But on an average,
the joke and the performance will be good.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
So, you just need to
see which of these there is.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.480
You're really good at writing,
because you are a writer.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.880
Maybe if you fall short on performance,
double down on your personality.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.720
-Just, know naturally how you can do it.
-I've gotta get some water, sorry.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.120
Performance is gone.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.440
-There is only joke.
-He shat all over your…

10:29.520 --> 10:30.720
-My Analogy!
-your talk!

10:30.760 --> 10:34.160
Three glasses, water,
even with a leaf inside.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.600
Also, you have a very
peculiar personality.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.200
You have a different
style from him and from me.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.880
You have a different style.
So, just be yourself.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.760
If this Punjabi boisterousness
is what works, then go for that.

10:43.840 --> 10:44.640
I'm hoping.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.720
I mean, I could be wrong.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.400
No one can dislike you
more than you are disliked now.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.200
-So, the only way is up.
-That's true.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.440
That's what--
How bad can it get?

10:52.520 --> 10:53.720
-How bad can it get?
-How bad--

10:53.760 --> 10:54.880
That's the best way to do it.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.400
That's self-motivation
talk for you for the day.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.320
Okay, fine.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
The show is in a couple of days.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.800
Write, rehearse.
We're here to help you out.

11:01.880 --> 11:02.720
Thank you so much!

11:02.800 --> 11:04.040
-Let's do this.
-Thank you!

11:16.760 --> 11:19.480
Well, I am more nervous now.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.080
I was nervous and excited,
I'm wavering through

11:22.160 --> 11:23.280
the two different emotions.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.600
I'm very excited in the morning,

11:24.920 --> 11:26.000
then get a little nervous…

11:26.080 --> 11:27.200
Now I'm very very nervous.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.600
You want to put your cue cards down?

11:28.840 --> 11:30.480
But then how will I know what to say?

11:31.040 --> 11:33.200
This is definitely very
much out of my comfort zone

11:33.280 --> 11:35.080
to do stand-up comedy for the first time.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.720
Have you ever regularly
sat with your mother-in-law

11:36.840 --> 11:37.960
and had bed tea?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.960
Sapan and Abish are extremely supportive

11:43.040 --> 11:45.120
and extremely annoying at the same time.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.600
Because they don't let go.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.000
I couldn't have done this without them.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.880
Make sure your story isn't the one

11:51.960 --> 11:54.160
that rests on the shelves for years.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.280
Is this a compliment or an insult?

11:56.360 --> 11:58.160
-Even I'm confused.
-Yeah, even I'm confused.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.880
I knew you would try to discourage me.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.440
This was written by a bunch of rascals.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.720
I know you guys very well!

12:05.080 --> 12:07.400
I was also actually worried
after the first zoom call

12:07.480 --> 12:08.840
I was like, "Oh, shit!"

12:09.360 --> 12:12.000
He has forgotten a lot of things
that we taught him that time.

12:12.080 --> 12:12.920
But today…

12:13.000 --> 12:14.520
I think this…
In-person tech check.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.520
We are like, "Now it's fine."

12:16.640 --> 12:17.560
-Now he has got it.
-Yeah.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.640
-That's true.
-Yeah.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.120
I realized something about myself recently

12:25.200 --> 12:28.240
that I am one of those
people who buys a lot of books

12:28.560 --> 12:29.880
but never ends up reading them.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.200
There are some people
like that in this room tonight?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.160
Yeah? Like the last book I bought was…

12:34.240 --> 12:37.080
I bought the biography of Steve Jobs.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.720
650 pages hardcover.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.720
Do you know what I'm doing
with that book right now?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.280
You know how you have to use something to
raise your laptop a little for Zoom calls?

12:48.760 --> 12:50.360
That's where that book is kept.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.360
I feel bad for Steve Jobs.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.800
He made the iPod, he made the iPhone,

12:53.880 --> 12:55.880
and now he's reduced to
being a laptop stand in my house.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.280
No way to honor his legacy.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.360
But I want to become
one of those book readers.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.720
Because in this society,
we have this notion that

13:02.800 --> 13:04.600
people who read books
are very smart and intelligent.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.440
But people who watch movies are dumb.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.880
Right? We do that.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.320
Lot of love stories begin like that.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.200
People show off saying things like,
"We met at a bookstore.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.920
She was reading Murakami.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.240
I was reading Hemingway."

13:17.920 --> 13:20.400
No love story starts with,
"We met at Vijay Sales.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.640
She was watching <i>Saavdhan India.</i>

13:24.320 --> 13:26.440
I was the creep from <i>Saavdhan India.</i>"

13:27.120 --> 13:28.720
Right? Doesn't happen.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.000
I want to become a book reader

13:32.080 --> 13:33.960
so I can also show off
like book readers, you know?

13:34.160 --> 13:37.160
Walk into any conversation and throw
random adjectives about myself.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.320
Be like, "Hi! I'm a voracious reader.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.240
I'm an avid reader.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.920
I'm an Adobe Reader."

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
Just throw these words.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.720
What is the connection here?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.560
Worst are those book readers

13:51.640 --> 13:53.560
who gift you books on your birthday.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.760
I'm like, "Why are you gifting
me homework on my birthday?"

13:57.720 --> 14:00.040
Like, one of my friends gifted
me a very popular self-help book,

14:00.120 --> 14:02.440
I'm guessing you might
have heard the name.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.040
It's called "Seven Habits
of Highly Effective People."

14:06.240 --> 14:07.440
I read the title, I got confused.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.360
I'm like, "Does he think
I'm not effective enough?"

14:10.520 --> 14:11.800
Messed with my head the entire week.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.680
So, on his birthday,
I gifted him Fifty Shades of Grey.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.560
Like, "Here"s a self-help book for you.
Go on, read it."

14:20.920 --> 14:22.800
And I'm okay with book
readers who read books, you know,

14:22.880 --> 14:24.120
because book readers have this habit.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.040
Book readers carry
a book wherever they go.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.240
They are reading at a coffee shop,

14:27.320 --> 14:28.560
they are reading in the train,
reading in a taxi.

14:28.640 --> 14:29.520
That's fine.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.720
Some of them go to
the beach and read a book!

14:32.560 --> 14:34.800
I'm like, "Why have you
brought a book to the beach?

14:35.160 --> 14:36.640
Why are you ruining the vibe here?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.400
Making others feel guilty!"

14:40.120 --> 14:41.840
Do we ever go to the library
wearing a bikini?

14:43.320 --> 14:44.400
We don't, do we?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.520
You stay in your place,
we'll stay in ours.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.720
And my problem is that I feel like,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.960
in this country,
we don't respect writers so much.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.400
You can be the best writer in the world.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.600
In India, we don't care about you.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.400
Like, William Shakespeare,
such a prominent figure.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.000
But in India, we don't care about him.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.200
I also know Shakespeare mainly because

15:01.280 --> 15:04.120
Vishal Bhardwaj keeps
adapting his books into movies.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.360
<i>Omkara, Haider, Maqbool,</i> right?

15:06.680 --> 15:07.680
Like today, somebody tells me,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.280
"Quote your favorite line from Othello."

15:09.480 --> 15:11.720
I'll be like,
<i>"Beedi jalai le jigar se piya!</i>

15:12.560 --> 15:14.280
<i>Jigar ma badi aag hai!</i>"

15:16.040 --> 15:18.320
Alright, speaking of books,
are you guys ready

15:18.400 --> 15:20.600
for your surprise celebrity
guest of the evening, yes?

15:22.080 --> 15:25.280
Alright. This guy is a
successful investment banker

15:25.360 --> 15:27.120
turned India's best-selling author,

15:27.280 --> 15:29.400
whose books have resulted
in some of the biggest

15:29.480 --> 15:30.960
Bollywood blockbuster films such as

15:31.040 --> 15:33.160
<i>Three Idiots, Two States</i> and <i>Kai Po Che.</i>

15:33.240 --> 15:34.560
You guys know who he is.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.160
Put your hands together for
Chetan Bhagat!

15:42.240 --> 15:43.160
Hi!

15:48.480 --> 15:49.360
Wow, man!

15:50.560 --> 15:53.120
So, you are the brave
ones who have braved this.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.320
Yes!

15:54.400 --> 15:56.640
I mean, people in India
are asking for the cancellation

15:56.720 --> 15:58.560
of JEE and cancel NEET
because of corona.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.240
And you all have told your family that
you are going to watch stand-up comedy.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.720
Anyway, I was the surprise
guest for the evening.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.240
They said surprise.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.240
They didn't promise a good one.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.400
You people have been screwed with.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.920
Because in the previous episode,
which was shot a few days back,

16:18.040 --> 16:19.160
the guest was Sunny Leone.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.080
Oh, what happened?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.480
What happened?
Missing your favorite lady?

16:28.480 --> 16:29.440
I'm a writer,

16:29.600 --> 16:30.880
but he mentioned that
before being a writer,

16:30.960 --> 16:32.560
I was a successful investment banker.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.760
Tell me something.
Who said successful?

16:36.320 --> 16:37.280
It's an assumption people are making.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.920
That I was a successful investment banker.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.160
They don't know that I was
barely saving myself from being fired.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.280
My boss kept saying,
"When are you going to leave?

16:44.400 --> 16:45.480
Go do something else!"

16:46.920 --> 16:48.320
I did engineering first.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.280
Mechanical engineering.
They don't teach you banking there.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.920
But I did get scarred.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.320
There wasn't one girl in our
whole mechanical engineering class.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.080
It messes a man up.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.240
Like, what the hell is going on?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.200
You know, we didn't even
have Alexa-Siri back then.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.600
When I went to IIM,

17:05.720 --> 17:06.960
I was like,
"I'm not wasting my time here.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.080
I don't want to study management here.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.640
Let me just find a girl.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.640
All my focus will be on that."

17:13.440 --> 17:14.280
And I did find one.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.640
Any Tamils here?

17:16.560 --> 17:18.280
I knew there wouldn't be any.
They don't come to these things.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.640
Any Punjabis?

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
Right, so I am Punjabi.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.480
But my wedding was a Tamil-style one.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.320
If anybody here--
Has anyone attended a Tamil wedding?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.160
Nobody, right?
You know why?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.720
The wedding begins at 6:00 a.m.
And ends at 8:00 a.m.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.280
And then all the guests go to work.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.800
Why does a guy get married?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.000
What is the popular reason?

17:40.280 --> 17:41.240
For the wedding night, right?

17:41.800 --> 17:43.280
Now, if your wedding
is over at 8:00 in the morning,

17:43.320 --> 17:44.800
what do you do, make it a "wedding day"?

17:46.520 --> 17:48.520
What are you supposed to do? Right?

17:50.320 --> 17:52.000
My wedding wasn't a smooth affair either.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.320
My in-laws are not only Tamils,
they are Tamil Brahmins.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.760
My mom had another concern.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.280
She's like, "Chetan, what are you doing?

17:58.320 --> 17:59.320
How is this helping anyone?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.160
How is this good for anyone on earth?"

18:01.320 --> 18:03.440
I said, "Well, it's good
for Arjun Kapoor's career at least."

18:05.200 --> 18:06.040
Right?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.760
I got married.
Then I decided to become a writer.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.560
You should have seen my in-laws then.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.640
They were already like, "Alright.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.200
He's not a Tamil, but we
accepted that, didn't we?

18:22.280 --> 18:25.520
He's already balding,
but we accepted that too, right?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.080
He's a bit of an idiot,
but we accepted that.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.560
How much more can a person take?

18:31.080 --> 18:32.560
Now he says he's going to quit his job

18:32.720 --> 18:34.200
and make our daughter
earn a living for the two of them.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.800
This is a scam by these Punjabis.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.680
They all just want to sit at home.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.800
This has always been his plan."

18:40.880 --> 18:43.160
Because being a writer is not a real job.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.640
There was a stage in my life

18:44.720 --> 18:46.240
when my wife used to go
to the office every morning,

18:46.320 --> 18:48.200
and the visual trauma of
this thing stays with you.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.560
I was in shorts and my mother-in-law
was giving me judgmental looks.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.880
She's glancing at me while
she's reading <i>The Times of India.</i>

18:53.960 --> 18:56.160
"So, what are you going to do today?"

18:57.160 --> 18:59.040
Well, a writer doesn't
do much in that sense.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.080
I'm not a carpenter, who will be like,
"I'll make a table today."

19:03.040 --> 19:03.880
Right?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.320
I said, "I'm going to think today."

19:07.200 --> 19:08.560
My wife used to go to the bank, you know.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.280
She was also from IIM Ahmedabad.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.920
So, she was the
Chief Operating Officer at a bank.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.080
She used to come home in the evening.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.280
I used to ask her,
"How was your day?" You know?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.280
You have to ask this,
when you're not earning.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.240
She's the breadwinner.
I have to ask her nicely.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.680
What can you do?
It's just the ego.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.160
So, she--

19:26.720 --> 19:27.560
So, she'd be like, "It was good.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.800
We had an Asia-Pacific strategy meet

19:29.920 --> 19:31.400
and we had all these people come in.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.800
We're opening in two other markets

19:32.920 --> 19:34.440
and we're going to two other countries.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.960
And we have this plan for next year."

19:36.160 --> 19:37.000
I said, "Okay."

19:37.080 --> 19:38.720
"How was your day?
What did you do?"

19:39.320 --> 19:40.680
I said, "I fixed the flush."

19:45.640 --> 19:47.480
So, I wrote a book
about my IIT experience,

19:47.560 --> 19:49.400
you might have seen the movie.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.040
You know these critics…

19:52.800 --> 19:55.280
who, I don't know why,
have a problem with me.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.640
I've never done anything to them.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.000
So, one of the reviews said,
"He has written a dildo of a book."

20:03.320 --> 20:04.880
I'm not joking, you can Google this.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.680
Chetan Bhagat Dildo Book…
It'll show up.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.040
The internet never forgets, you know?

20:12.320 --> 20:15.800
Now, the thing is that I
didn't know that it was a bad thing.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.320
I thought,
a dildo gives you so much pleasure!

20:19.680 --> 20:21.920
It makes you self-sufficient.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.400
It's an object that
helps you reach an orgasm.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.720
And my books are doing that!

20:26.200 --> 20:27.440
So, I was happy.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.800
I finally had something
to impress my mother-in-law.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.200
So, I sent her the review,

20:31.320 --> 20:34.400
"Look. This is who your son-in-law is.
Don't underestimate him."

20:35.680 --> 20:36.560
Okay?

20:37.560 --> 20:38.560
Well--

20:39.200 --> 20:43.000
Well, my in-laws did not
even know what a dildo is.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.440
They assumed it must
have been something nice.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.480
So, they started sending it to
all their Tamil WhatsApp groups.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.440
"Look at our son-in-law!
The dildo…"

20:53.520 --> 20:54.680
So, I started writing books.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.640
Then I got more ambitious.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.320
So, I started writing for newspapers,
on the editorial page.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.880
Editorial page is the
middle page in a newspaper.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.000
When Punjabis want to eat
something in bed,

21:05.080 --> 21:06.320
we spread a newspaper on the bed.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.680
And which page do we choose?

21:08.960 --> 21:09.960
The one that nobody ever reads.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.280
So, we spread the middle page,
which has the editorial.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.760
So, that page.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.320
I decided to write for
that page and I started off.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.880
When I praise the government,
the liberals get pissed.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.560
When I criticize the government,
the right-wing folks get pissed.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.080
Both hate me!

21:27.320 --> 21:29.800
It gave me the wedding-like feel again,
when both in-laws and my mom were pissed.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.400
What's going on?

21:34.240 --> 21:35.400
But there's a difference.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.520
The left-wing people speak good English.

21:38.240 --> 21:42.080
So, they go like, "What an abysmal,
appalling, diabolical column."

21:43.440 --> 21:44.800
Well, it doesn't sound like
they're cussing.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.720
Abysmal, huh?
I want to be abysmal!

21:48.480 --> 21:49.400
I've never been called abysmal.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.440
Alright?

21:50.800 --> 21:53.160
And the right-wing are like, "I'm
never going to read your column again."

21:54.800 --> 21:55.680
So…

21:56.800 --> 21:58.480
I get to see a variety of people.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.200
But I wondered what I could do next.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.240
Where can I gain some respect from?

22:04.720 --> 22:05.880
I was like, "There is one way.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.280
I'll have to go to a place
where people don't read a lot."

22:09.800 --> 22:11.080
And that is Bollywood.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.840
They don't really read much in Bollywood.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.760
But, to impress me, they say
things like, "Oh, you're a writer.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.120
Oh, yeah, you know…

22:18.520 --> 22:20.200
We read a lot of books, you know…

22:20.800 --> 22:23.360
Cinema and literature should merge."

22:23.960 --> 22:26.080
I said, "Yes, sir".
"I've been reading a lot."

22:26.480 --> 22:27.480
I ask, "What have you been reading?"

22:27.560 --> 22:29.200
They reply, "Chetan Bhagat."
I'm like, "Oh, Okay.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.840
Now I know the level you are at.
Alright."

22:36.720 --> 22:40.000
I had a meeting with
a big producer for a film.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.680
The meeting was the next day.
I was like, "How do I prepare for this?"

22:43.120 --> 22:45.640
What would you normally do?
You would ask your friends, right?

22:45.720 --> 22:48.720
My friends are all engineers,
all from IIT and stuff, nerds…

22:49.440 --> 22:51.120
They have no connection with Bollywood.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.160
But they've seen a couple of movies.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.640
Anyone in India who
has seen a couple of movies

22:54.720 --> 22:56.320
thinks that they understand
the business of Bollywood.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.440
They know everything.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.080
They were like, "We'll tell you, Chetan.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.080
you'll have to be prepared for one thing.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.720
You might have to "compromise."

23:04.240 --> 23:07.160
The producer has called you,
anything can happen."

23:09.600 --> 23:10.920
I was like, "Really? I mean,

23:11.600 --> 23:12.920
they spend time with models,

23:13.000 --> 23:14.520
or even actors and stuff--
Why would they want me?"

23:17.320 --> 23:18.200
Right?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.000
My nerdy friends!

23:23.240 --> 23:24.920
"Think about it.
You're an alumnus of IIT-IIM.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.280
That's a different high.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.360
They get models every day."

23:32.000 --> 23:34.320
I was like, "What do I do now?"

23:35.080 --> 23:36.160
I couldn't sleep all night.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.560
The only thing going
on in my mind was that

23:37.640 --> 23:39.040
I wanted to get ahead in life.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.120
I wanted my stories to be made into films.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.880
It was about my honor, my character…

23:45.640 --> 23:47.200
I was like,
"I have to find a middle ground."

23:48.160 --> 23:49.600
So, I decided that
I'll have to compromise.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.920
My own compromise.

23:51.880 --> 23:52.720
Handjob.

23:54.960 --> 23:55.800
See…

23:57.200 --> 23:59.040
I'm a writer.
I write with my own hands.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.320
Next day,
I woke up in the morning, showered,

24:01.400 --> 24:03.160
moisturized my hands.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.880
I mean, you should be considerate.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.000
The other person shouldn't
have any trouble, right?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.640
So, I went to the meeting,

24:12.800 --> 24:14.320
"Hi, sir. Hi."

24:15.040 --> 24:17.720
"I read your story.
Very nice, you know.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.160
There is magic in your hands."

24:20.320 --> 24:22.080
I said, "Sir, you're yet to
experience the best of it."

24:23.600 --> 24:25.720
So…

24:28.520 --> 24:32.200
So, he said, "Here is a pen. Sign here."

24:32.280 --> 24:35.120
I signed. "Okay, done. We'll do the deal."

24:35.360 --> 24:36.200
Okay.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.760
So, the deal was done.
The movie was being made.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.440
But I was feeling incomplete.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.160
I felt like I was rejected.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.800
I was like, "Man, this is not fair.
I mean, you can't…"

24:46.560 --> 24:49.600
I still feel that it was
incomplete, you know…

24:52.080 --> 24:54.720
The last thing that I do,

24:54.800 --> 24:56.520
which will tell you more about me.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.840
Since the business was running so well,

24:57.920 --> 24:59.720
I started giving
motivational talks as well.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.640
There are two types
of motivational speakers.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.160
One type, who are super-talented,
super-inspiring.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.560
Like Sachin Tendulkar.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.640
If Sachin Tendulkar comes here,
you'll chant his name, right?

25:09.720 --> 25:10.760
You'll be like, "He is the one!"

25:10.920 --> 25:12.960
So, he is a category
one motivational speaker.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.160
The other is my category.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.800
People that you look at and think, "If
this idiot can succeed, we can surely do!

25:19.320 --> 25:20.960
If he can have a good life,
we can have it too."

25:22.040 --> 25:23.920
People from my category are more useful.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.520
Because you are not like Sachin, right?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.080
It's more likely that you are like me.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.360
So…

25:33.760 --> 25:35.680
I'll leave you with one last thought.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.520
Why is it that you've heard
about Chetan Bhagat the most?

25:37.880 --> 25:38.840
I'm not the best writer.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.280
I'm the best-selling writer.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.320
And in the end,
that's what matters the most.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.320
So, why did it happen?

25:46.680 --> 25:48.880
How and why it happened is a--

25:49.080 --> 25:50.160
I don't know if this is comedy or what,

25:50.240 --> 25:52.280
but I thought I could share some wisdom

25:52.360 --> 25:53.600
since I've got the opportunity.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.280
This is what happens in India,
this is what uncles do.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.840
They meet someone,
they start lecturing them.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.840
So, let me explain with an example,
which is my inspiration.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.680
My inspiration is cockroach.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.880
Cockroaches are one of the
most adaptive creatures on earth.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.160
It can survive anywhere, in any condition.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.280
Adaptive means "Alright, buddy.
It's fine. I'll adjust."

26:13.120 --> 26:14.400
They used to live in the forest earlier,

26:15.120 --> 26:16.920
now they have to live in Andheri.
"Alright, buddy."

26:18.640 --> 26:19.760
It's not a problem.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.840
The government is
hell-bent on saving tigers.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.040
It's legally a crime to kill them.
But people do it anyway.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.800
You can legally kill cockroaches,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.280
and nobody particularly
likes them socially either.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.920
Nobody says, "It's so cute.
Please don't kill it."

26:33.520 --> 26:34.600
It's not a rabbit.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.520
Cockroaches get immune
to the bloody spray as well!

26:37.360 --> 26:38.600
It's like single malt for them.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.560
If you adopt this attitude in life,

26:43.400 --> 26:44.680
you will definitely succeed!

26:44.840 --> 26:48.080
You would have seen
other writers only in books.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.360
But me, you've seen me in books,

26:49.440 --> 26:51.360
you've seen me in films,
you've seen me in the newspapers,

26:51.600 --> 26:53.640
you've seen me on social media
as well as on television.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.920
And the only thing
I had not yet adapted to

26:56.120 --> 26:59.240
was that I had not yet appeared
on a digital platform like Prime.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.640
Today, that has been fulfilled as well.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.640
This is me, Chetan Bhagat

27:02.800 --> 27:04.160
and I hope you liked my act.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.480
Thank you so much!

27:08.640 --> 27:10.720
Give it up for Chetan Bhagat,
everyone! Yes!

27:15.080 --> 27:16.440
It's over, Chetan. You can relax.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.640
Did you have a good time?

27:18.720 --> 27:22.280
I honestly wanted to do something
different that I've never done before

27:22.360 --> 27:24.200
because that is what
I tell in all my talks.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.400
I tell people to go out of
their comfort zone and do things.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.920
If people giving advice
are not following it themselves,

27:29.400 --> 27:30.240
it doesn't feel right.

27:30.320 --> 27:31.640
You can't say it assertively.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.840
Thank you so much, guys!
Give it up for Chetan Bhagat!

27:34.960 --> 27:36.320
Give it up for Abish Mathew!

27:37.080 --> 27:38.880
My name is Sapan Verma,
this is One Mic Stand.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.400
Thank you so much for coming out.
See you. Bye!

27:49.680 --> 27:50.880
-Good, good.
-Thank you, thank you!

27:50.960 --> 27:52.080
Well done.
How are you feeling?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.200
You tell me how you are feeling.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.960
I feel like I've just landed from space.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.280
Like, I've done something so big.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.920
I think the tips you
gave me really helped.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.200
It's one of those things, right?

28:02.280 --> 28:05.880
When you learn to ride a bike, initially,
you need the training wheels.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.640
Then slowly, your dad loosens
his grip and then let's go.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.440
One day, when you guys are doing a show

28:09.520 --> 28:12.040
I would love to come and
intro your show for you guys…

28:12.320 --> 28:13.960
-That's great!
-and bring that memory.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.640
-Okay, thank you, guys!
-Thank you, guys!

28:15.720 --> 28:16.840
Thank you!
