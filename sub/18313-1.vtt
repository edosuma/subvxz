02:51.037 --> 02:52.568
Hey, wait!

02:56.476 --> 02:58.371
- Banker!
- You brat!

02:58.478 --> 02:59.906
Asshole.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.950
Baby, you almost hit them.

03:04.951 --> 03:08.086
You want me to go back
and try a second time?

03:11.791 --> 03:13.720
Where are we, anyway?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.495
I thought you were in
charge of the maps.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.290
Maps bore me.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.232
<i>And now, for the weather.</i>

03:25.438 --> 03:27.973
<i>For the weekend, the outlook
is for clear skies...</i>

03:27.974 --> 03:30.438
<i>with temperatures in the mid-60s.</i>

03:30.677 --> 03:34.079
<i>Clear conditions are expected
to prevail well into the week.</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:35.647
<i>And now, back to our music.</i>

03:35.648 --> 03:38.283
I don't like the look of
these clouds up ahead.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.152
Maybe we should pull over.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.253
Where? A nearby cave?

03:47.293 --> 03:49.791
- This is incredible.
- What?

03:50.363 --> 03:52.360
Isn't this something, baby?

04:00.673 --> 04:02.101
Oh, God!

04:09.215 --> 04:10.746
Come on.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.687
- Well?
- Okay.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.998
Piece of shit!
Couldn't get the Rolls, could you?

04:33.873 --> 04:35.335
Try it again.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.472
God damn it! All right.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.913
- God damn it!
- Careful of the mud, dear.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.954
Jesus Christ!

04:48.955 --> 04:53.392
Daddy, stop swearing.
Mommy says it's not nice to swear.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.626
Shut up.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.629
- But Mommy says...
- Well, Mommy's not here now.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.131
- But...
- Judith.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.799
Rosemary.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.025
That's "Mama Rosemary."

05:04.037 --> 05:06.838
You're not my mother.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.370
Thank God.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.480
I could use a little
help out here, dearest.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.717
Unless you plan on levitating this
thing, I think it's here to stay.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.283
Damn.

05:20.787 --> 05:21.987
Daddy.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.713
- I'm gonna kill that kid.
- Stand in line.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.396
It looks like the storm's
kicking up again.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.765
I think we should just
leave the car and split.

05:33.766 --> 05:37.402
- This whole road could flood out.
- You want me to walk?

05:40.573 --> 05:43.742
Not far.
Just down the road, look.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.574
Hon, that means shelter.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.487
Maybe we can make it
before the rain starts up again.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.815
Lovely vacation you planned.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.677
Leave that thing here.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.980
Teddy and I go everywhere together.
We're best friends.

06:21.981 --> 06:25.116
- Come on.
- Not this time, tootsie.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.848
You'll travel faster solo.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.856
<i>Teddy'll get you for that.</i>

07:03.323 --> 07:04.751
Oh, God!

07:10.530 --> 07:12.322
- Oh, shit!
- Teddy!

07:12.565 --> 07:13.789
No!

07:32.585 --> 07:34.776
Daddy.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.829
Oh, Teddy.

07:51.337 --> 07:54.597
Quit moaning about that toy
and get moving.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.842
What is holding you two up?

07:56.843 --> 07:59.204
Your kid is daydreaming again.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.214
All right.
What is it this time, Judy?

08:02.215 --> 08:06.010
Ghosts? Goblins?
Little green men on pie-plates?

08:06.119 --> 08:10.312
Jeez, I don't know what kind of crap
your mother's been feeding you.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.018
Holy cow!

08:25.705 --> 08:27.566
Look at this place.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.409
Not exactly a four-star hotel.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.526
- Come on, short stuff.
- Come on!

09:02.608 --> 09:03.900
Knock.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.783
- Maybe they left because of the storm.
- Maybe.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.516
Suppose they know
something we don't.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.494
Suppose this place is flooding out.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.629
Suppose they left
for higher ground.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.966
- Suppose we're trapped here! Suppose...
- Suppose you shut up.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.234
What?

09:29.235 --> 09:33.166
I said, I suppose they shut up
this place because of the storm.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.374
- Hello?
- Knock again.

10:19.652 --> 10:23.413
- We can get in this way.
- That's breaking and entering.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.819
Who's going to arrest us out here?
Count Dracula?

10:27.226 --> 10:28.688
Come on.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.259
- Come on.
- No.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.075
- Your hand.
- Sorry.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.168
- This coat is ruined.
- Sorry.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.510
Watch your step.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.445
This looks like a warehouse.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.455
There's got to be a light switch
around here somewhere.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.375
- Nice going.
- I got scared.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.313
What did you see this time?

11:40.466 --> 11:42.759
Much as we love visitors...

11:42.969 --> 11:45.865
we do prefer them to
use the front door.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.144
But the front door's locked
and no one answered.

11:53.145 --> 11:57.372
- And we were awfully wet.
- Oh, poor dear.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.918
Got taken unawares by the storm?

12:03.489 --> 12:06.522
They do arise rather
suddenly around here.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.484
All right. Come on up.
Come up and get warm.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.991
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.146
What's the matter?
Afraid of the dark?

12:28.147 --> 12:30.975
No, afraid of what's in the dark.

12:37.189 --> 12:40.381
She's always daydreaming.
Seeing things.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.791
You have an active imagination?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.792
- I suppose.
- That's good.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.363
Then you've come to
the right house.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.098
That you have.

12:53.906 --> 12:57.769
Come into the kitchen.
We have the stove on.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.273
This old house gets
clammy when it rains.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.695
Wow!

13:24.837 --> 13:28.506
I'll get a hot meal inside you, then
give you a tour of the house, okay?

13:28.507 --> 13:29.799
Okay.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.217
What's the matter, my dear?

13:48.027 --> 13:49.990
Just my imagination.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.133
I've never seen a storm like this.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.327
Yes, they are quite fierce.
Strangers never seem to see them coming.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.006
Not that we get many
tourists around here.

14:02.374 --> 14:05.873
People do frighten of the forests
and the violent storms.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.179
- But we like them, don't we, my dear?
- Oh, yes.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.717
This can be the most
exciting place to live.

14:12.952 --> 14:16.713
- You're kidding me.
- Hilary and I... Where are my manners?

14:16.956 --> 14:20.148
I'm Gabriel Hartwicke,
and this is my wife, Hilary.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.428
David Bower. This is my wife,
Rosemary, and my daughter...

14:23.429 --> 14:24.721
Judy.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.894
That's not my real mother.
My real mother lives in Boston.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.630
Can it.

14:30.903 --> 14:34.937
This will put a little meat
on your bones, dearie.

14:37.143 --> 14:41.746
- You chose an unusual spot for a vacation.
- Tell me about it.

14:41.747 --> 14:44.716
Unusual, but rich in
adventure and beauty.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.444
- How do you stand the weather?
- We're used to these storms.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.255
They're almost magical.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.259
They seem to go on and on.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.094
It's like one long night.

14:56.095 --> 15:00.288
Exactly, my dear.
The longest night in the world.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.092
How quaint.

15:02.134 --> 15:05.963
The weather brings out creativity.
It helps me in my work.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.735
What kind of work is that?
Witchcraft?

15:13.412 --> 15:14.846
Close to it.

15:14.847 --> 15:18.813
I'm a doll maker.
I make the most wonderful toys:

15:18.984 --> 15:22.051
Dolls, puppets,
soldiers, ballerinas.

15:22.388 --> 15:27.048
But nowadays, people seem to want
their playthings mass-produced.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.028
Nobody wants dolls
that are special anymore...

15:30.029 --> 15:32.959
- that are one-of-a-kind.
- I do.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.961
Yes, I believe you do.

15:35.401 --> 15:38.434
Judy, tell me, one thing
I've noticed about you.

15:38.971 --> 15:42.834
You don't have a doll.
That doesn't seem natural to me.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.477
A little girl without a doll
is somehow incomplete.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.047
I had Teddy when I
left the car, but...

15:49.048 --> 15:52.308
But the clumsy little dear
dropped him in the forest.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.654
I dropped it in the forest.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.915
That's a shame.
I can't replace Teddy.

16:00.392 --> 16:04.084
But I can make sure you have
some company whilst you're here.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.590
A very dear friend of mine.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.301
I like him.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.171
- Say hello to Mr. Punch.
- Hello, Mr. Punch.

16:13.172 --> 16:16.274
Punch's partner's name is Judy.
The same as yours.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.109
Hear that? We're partners.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.746
Come on, Mr. Punch. You'll sit
down with me and have some soup.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.072
Okay, Judy.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.813
Jesus! I feel like shit!

16:33.325 --> 16:35.493
Wet to the bleeding skin.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.120
God!

16:42.434 --> 16:47.230
Hi. Please excuse us.
My name is Ralph. Ralph Morris.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.175
These girls, they were just
hitchhiking and so I picked them up.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.934
Picked us up?

16:53.746 --> 16:57.939
- Trying to catch some talent, Ralph?
- They're just kidding.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.618
I just thought because it
was raining, you know.

17:00.619 --> 17:03.054
You thought you'd try a threesome?

17:03.055 --> 17:07.358
No! It was just because it was raining
and the way you guys are dressed...

17:07.358 --> 17:08.693
I just thought...

17:08.694 --> 17:11.488
What's the matter
with the way we're dressed?

17:11.563 --> 17:14.265
- Come and sit over here, Ralph.
- Thank you.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.026
My name is Gabriel,
and my wife, Hilary.

17:17.469 --> 17:21.537
- David, Rosemary, and Judy.
- And Punch.

17:21.973 --> 17:26.372
Oh, jeez! I haven't seen a
Punch doll since I was a kid.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.807
You like toys?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.949
You like to play around, Ralphie?

17:30.950 --> 17:33.812
Oh, yes! I mean, no.

17:33.953 --> 17:38.056
I liked dolls when I was a kid.
But, of course, I'm not little anymore.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.157
Prove it.

17:39.158 --> 17:40.959
This is Isabel and I'm Enid.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.096
You're all welcome to stay the night
until the storm settles down.

17:45.197 --> 17:48.633
Why don't you show our guests
to their rooms, Gabriel?

17:48.634 --> 17:51.359
All right.
Let's get you people settled in.

18:11.857 --> 18:14.252
Here, let me give you a hand.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.527
There you go.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.128
Hey, mister.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.601
- Ralph.
- Ralph, are you scared?

18:23.602 --> 18:26.137
Of course not.
What's there to be afraid of?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.966
- This house.
- Don't be silly.

18:43.355 --> 18:46.991
Only one bed?
Where's the kid supposed to sleep?

18:46.992 --> 18:49.422
She has a room of her own.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.898
That's a wonderful idea.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.590
Yes. I thought you would like it.

19:04.443 --> 19:06.873
What do you think about Ralph?

19:07.046 --> 19:09.544
What do you mean? Do I fancy him?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.982
No, stupid.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.681
I mean,
is he gonna fall for it or not?

19:16.755 --> 19:19.480
I don't know.
I think we ought to forget it.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.890
Look.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.398
I mean, how can we nick his wallet
if we're surrounded by people...

19:27.399 --> 19:29.590
and he's in another room?

19:37.109 --> 19:38.708
Don't worry.

19:40.345 --> 19:44.413
I'll get to that fellow.
And his car keys.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.453
Sir?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.588
Sir, please wait.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.201
Is that where the elves live?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.267
- Who?
- The elves.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.934
No, Judy,
that's just a storage room.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.874
Then where are the fairies?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.310
Maybe there are a few
hiding in my workshop.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.944
Shall we see?

20:58.724 --> 21:01.688
Gabriel, this is great!

21:07.266 --> 21:08.966
You still like toys, do you?

21:08.967 --> 21:12.203
Yes, but it's too bad
we have to outgrow them, right?

21:12.204 --> 21:15.640
- No one says you have to.
- My daddy says you do.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.743
Daddies can be wrong sometimes,
darling. They're only human.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.348
My father taught me
everything I know.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.684
That's funny.
I was just thinking about my dad.

21:26.685 --> 21:30.154
He used to tell us stories about how
toys woke up after we were asleep.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.857
And they'd start to wander
all over the house.

21:32.858 --> 21:37.094
I stayed up night after night to see if I
could catch my toys playing on their own.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.462
Never made it.

21:38.463 --> 21:42.733
But I figured if they're having such
a good time, with or without me...

21:42.734 --> 21:44.902
they might as well eat.

21:45.170 --> 21:49.136
So I started leaving cookies
for them under my bed.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.035
And what happened?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.901
I raised several healthy
families of ants.

21:55.581 --> 22:00.081
But then Dad clued me in. He
said, "Toys eat imaginary cookies."

22:00.519 --> 22:04.780
- Your father sounds like a good man.
- Yeah, he was.

22:06.024 --> 22:09.819
He died when I was nine, though.
But you know, Gabriel...

22:09.962 --> 22:13.030
I can remember every single
toy I had when I was little.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.426
And they remember you, Ralph.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.898
Toys are very loyal.
And that is a fact.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.908
Tell me where the elves live.

22:23.909 --> 22:27.374
My darling, elves live
wherever they want to.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.358
Here you are.

22:43.395 --> 22:47.131
There's a bathroom next door if you
want to take that paint off your faces.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.366
The rain has streaked it.

22:48.367 --> 22:52.236
- It ain't paint. It's makeup.
- And it's not streaked.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.038
It's supposed to look like this.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.901
It is? Well, don't mind me.

22:56.975 --> 23:00.077
I'm afraid I'm not aware
of what's current and what isn't.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.481
We don't have very much contact
with the modern world here.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.617
- All this stuff's pretty old, ain't it?
- Yes, indeed.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.879
- Is it valuable?
- To us, certainly.

23:09.988 --> 23:12.623
I mean, would it be
valuable to anybody?

23:12.624 --> 23:15.693
Well, I'm certain that
people with an appreciation...

23:15.694 --> 23:18.029
for objects that were
made with loving care...

23:18.030 --> 23:21.065
- Yeah, but are they anticues?
- "Anticues"?

23:21.066 --> 23:23.291
You know, valuable, old shit.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.263
- Stuff.
- Antiques.

23:26.938 --> 23:31.909
Well, I suppose you could call some of
these things antique. They are old.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.812
I suppose you could call
me an antique, too.

23:34.813 --> 23:38.380
I'm just as old as
half of this stuff.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.477
Yeah, you sure are.

23:43.221 --> 23:44.755
Well, good night.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.758
Do you mind if we have
the radio on for a while?

23:47.759 --> 23:50.695
No, not at all.
It won't disturb us.

23:50.696 --> 23:54.093
Gabriel and I sleep at the
other end of the house.

23:55.634 --> 24:00.294
Pleasant dreams.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.936
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:06.712 --> 24:11.148
- Did you hear what she said?
- Yeah. We can play the radio for a while.

24:11.149 --> 24:15.753
- No! About the antikis.
- Well, what about them?

24:15.754 --> 24:18.149
This place is loaded with them.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.292
I bet they have old jewelry
and stuff stashed somewhere.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.628
We could swipe it tonight,
leave in the morning...

24:24.629 --> 24:28.959
and those two wouldn't notice
it for days. Or maybe even years.

24:29.668 --> 24:34.271
- No, they'd call the police.
- Do you see any phones around?

24:34.773 --> 24:37.533
Look,
we could make a fortune here.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.978
A lot more than we could nick
in old Ralphie boy's wallet.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.646
I don't know.

24:43.181 --> 24:46.817
I mean, they're so old.
They could be our grandparents.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.718
Well, they ain't.

24:48.954 --> 24:52.385
And besides, they'll probably
be dead soon, right?

24:54.126 --> 24:55.588
No, I...

24:56.161 --> 25:01.094
Look, we'll keep this on for a while, and
no one will hear me when I sneak out.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.663
And you just keep this blasting,
and I'll do the swiping.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.667
It won't take me long.
No prob.

25:09.608 --> 25:11.298
Okay, no prob.

25:55.420 --> 25:59.056
This is your room, sweetheart. We'll
call you in the morning for breakfast.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.691
Thanks, Mr. Gabriel.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.794
- Your room is further down the hall.
- Good night, Judy.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.330
Good night, Ralph.
Good night, Mr. Gabriel.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.759
Good night.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.142
God damn!

26:20.612 --> 26:24.339
You can hear those freaks' music
all the way across the hall.

26:24.449 --> 26:28.949
It's not so bad. It reminds me that
we're still in the 20th century.

26:29.955 --> 26:33.283
Well, at least the old fart
stocks some good wine.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.460
It tastes musty.
Just like this house.

26:36.895 --> 26:40.464
All right, look. You know what I'm
gonna do when we get out of here?

26:40.465 --> 26:44.226
Ship the kid back to Boston,
screw the divorce settlement.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.895
- We're young, we're rich.
- I'm rich.

26:49.474 --> 26:53.041
We're in the prime of our lives.
Who needs an anchor?

26:53.111 --> 26:57.213
Yeah, we could be in Monte Carlo right
now, if it wasn't for the twerp.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.428
"The next morning,
the witch put Gretel to work...

27:44.429 --> 27:46.722
"cooking and cleaning the house.

27:46.765 --> 27:51.001
"And the witch locked Hansel in a cage.
She was going to eat him first.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.537
"But she wanted to
fatten him up a little.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.273
"The witch made sure
that Hansel ate very well...

27:56.274 --> 28:00.811
"and every day she would ask him to
hold out his finger for her to pinch.

28:00.812 --> 28:03.810
"She wanted to see
how plump he had grown."

28:07.385 --> 28:10.884
Hey, Mr. Punch, I'm thirsty.
How about you?

28:11.189 --> 28:13.557
You bet. I'm real thirsty.

28:13.558 --> 28:18.127
- You want to go find something to drink?
- Let's go, kiddo.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.722
Bingo.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.583
Help me.

32:32.750 --> 32:36.113
Daddy, Rosemary,
the elves got one of the girls!

32:37.021 --> 32:40.357
- What?
- They dragged her away.

32:40.358 --> 32:41.592
Dragged who away?

32:41.593 --> 32:44.628
The girl. One of the girls
Ralph brought with him.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.896
Give me a break.

32:45.897 --> 32:48.465
I knew there was something weird
about this place.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.760
- The old man is probably a sex-fiend.
- Rosemary.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.038
All right, tell me
what happened, Judy.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.700
I got up to get a glass
of water with Punch...

32:57.701 --> 32:59.877
Wait. You wanted water and punch?

32:59.878 --> 33:02.646
No, I wanted water with Mr. Punch.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.215
Come on, get to the point,
Judy. Come on.

33:05.216 --> 33:08.783
I saw a girl get dragged
off into a room by an elf.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.555
- An elf?
- Yes, and then...

33:11.556 --> 33:14.391
Judy, what have I told you
about your stories?

33:14.392 --> 33:15.923
But this is...

33:16.227 --> 33:20.625
You'll wind up paying
more child support. My money.

33:24.569 --> 33:28.762
Look, I know you don't enjoy
spending your summers with me.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.807
I don't like it, either.

33:30.808 --> 33:33.875
But I'm sick of you lying
all the time, okay?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.046
I don't want to hear it anymore.

33:36.047 --> 33:39.616
No more fairies,
elves, princesses...

33:39.617 --> 33:43.453
ghosts, goblins, talking trees!
I'm sick of it all, okay?

33:43.454 --> 33:46.590
I don't want to hear any more
stories for the rest of the summer!

33:46.591 --> 33:48.892
Now, get out of here! Go to bed!

33:48.893 --> 33:50.294
- But...
- Out!

33:50.295 --> 33:53.430
- But, Daddy...
- You better do what he says, short stuff.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.794
He may not be able to give
you a swat, but I can.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.497
Yes, ma'am.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.337
No.

34:20.625 --> 34:24.226
Feel free to have an imaginary
cookie anytime you like.

34:25.228 --> 34:28.887
Or go ahead and get on your
imaginary phone and call takeout.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.594
We've got a long night
ahead of us, right?

34:52.556 --> 34:54.992
Judy. You just about
gave me a heart attack.

34:54.993 --> 34:57.761
- I have to ask you a question.
- Yeah?

34:57.762 --> 34:59.589
Do you trust kids?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.064
Yeah, I guess.

35:01.065 --> 35:04.201
- Do you believe things they tell you?
- Sure. Why?

35:04.202 --> 35:06.436
My mom does, too.
But my dad doesn't.

35:06.437 --> 35:10.007
Punch always believes me. He's my
best friend. Next to Teddy, my bear.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.342
Let me guess. You got
something to tell me, right?

35:12.343 --> 35:15.535
One of those girls
you brought here with you...

35:16.347 --> 35:18.981
- she's gone.
- Gone?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.785
- Gone where?
- They dragged her into a room.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.187
She was screaming and kicking
and bleeding.

35:24.188 --> 35:27.255
- Who did? Who dragged her away?
- The elves.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.890
This is not a fairy tale.
This is real.

35:32.296 --> 35:36.133
Great. Well, we'll just check
it out in the morning.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.101
But suppose there isn't a morning?

35:38.102 --> 35:40.904
Suppose this is the longest night
in the whole world?

35:40.905 --> 35:43.807
Remember what Mr. Gabriel said
about the storm?

35:43.808 --> 35:45.809
Yes, but he was just being poetic.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.745
Suppose the elves get more
people during the storm?

35:48.746 --> 35:51.281
Suppose they're satisfied
with only one?

35:51.282 --> 35:54.542
I mean, maybe they
were just lonely.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.379
Well, I guess you're right.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.685
- Judy.
- Yes, Ralph?

36:04.362 --> 36:07.497
- What's that on your slippers?
- I don't know.

36:14.138 --> 36:15.505
It's blood.

36:15.506 --> 36:19.301
Yeah, well, it was pretty bloody
when they dragged her away.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.908
You weren't kidding, were you?

36:22.413 --> 36:24.414
- Judy.
- Yes, Ralph?

36:24.415 --> 36:27.982
- Can you show me where it happened?
- I guess so.

36:30.555 --> 36:33.815
Okay. Let's go.

36:40.064 --> 36:43.333
- I think it was around here.
- You're not sure?

36:43.334 --> 36:46.526
What do you want from me?
I'm 7 years old.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.447
- Okay, which way, left or right?
- Right.

37:03.087 --> 37:04.515
I think.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.550
Stay close.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.372
I thought I heard a rat.

38:06.317 --> 38:08.246
Oh, my God. Come on.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.589
Nothing in here.

38:23.367 --> 38:26.229
Well, that takes a
load off my mind.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.063
Look.

38:38.216 --> 38:41.579
Oh, no. This way.

38:58.402 --> 39:01.400
- It's sticky.
- Maybe blood, huh?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.533
Maybe.

39:13.584 --> 39:16.063
Do you think they took
her up to the attic?

39:16.064 --> 39:17.267
I don't know.

39:17.822 --> 39:22.482
Maybe there's just a window open up
there, or maybe a hole in the roof.

39:23.761 --> 39:27.453
I'll tell you what.
Wait here and I'll go check.

39:27.765 --> 39:30.297
Why? I've been in attics before.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.660
Okay, come on.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.034
What is all this stuff?
It's all dusty.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.511
Looks like it hasn't
been used in years.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.846
Thank God.

40:21.852 --> 40:24.850
We better go down
and tell somebody about this.

40:26.223 --> 40:29.756
My dad won't believe you.
He didn't believe me.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.263
They'll believe me.
I'm a grownup.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.829
Ralph, look out!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.870
Ralph, are you okay?

40:40.871 --> 40:43.164
Yeah. Sure.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.177
What happened?

40:47.178 --> 40:50.836
There were some dolls up there,
and you tripped over them.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.175
I thought a rat bit me.

41:04.328 --> 41:06.359
What the hell are you doing?

41:07.532 --> 41:09.908
Something's happened
to one of the girls.

41:09.909 --> 41:11.802
Daddy, remember? I told you!

41:11.803 --> 41:14.631
Yeah, we know. Elves.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.374
No, please, listen to this.
Look at this!

41:17.375 --> 41:19.209
- What is that? Blood?
- Yes!

41:19.210 --> 41:22.079
- Isabel, you nearly...
- He's not Isabel.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.180
I can see that.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.716
I'm sorry, but something's
happened to your friend.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.852
- What do you mean?
- I saw her get dragged off.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.621
Judy,
I warned you about that crap.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.325
I don't know what's happened to her,
but there's blood all over the hallway!

41:35.326 --> 41:37.494
What have you done with her?

41:37.495 --> 41:40.697
You took a fancy to her
when you picked us up, didn't you?

41:40.698 --> 41:43.867
Isabel was right!
You wanted some quick fun!

41:44.168 --> 41:47.037
What did you do, follow her?
Then when she said no...

41:47.038 --> 41:49.573
No! I was fast asleep in my bed.

41:49.574 --> 41:52.265
- That's right.
- How would you know?

41:53.544 --> 41:56.079
You get away from my
daughter, pervert.

41:56.080 --> 42:00.150
No, please, just listen to me. Look,
I don't know what's happened to her.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.219
All I know is... I don't know.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.055
There's something really funny
going on in this house.

42:05.056 --> 42:08.589
- It's the little people.
- Exactly!

42:08.826 --> 42:10.927
No! It is no... Oh, God!

42:10.928 --> 42:14.197
All I'm suggesting is that we just
search the house for the girl.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.634
You can't con me. You've
killed Isabel, haven't you?

42:17.635 --> 42:19.703
No, please, I didn't! No!

42:19.704 --> 42:22.739
God, look at him.
You're covered in blood.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.032
I am...

42:25.409 --> 42:26.598
I am.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.148
See? I told you I got
bit by that rat.

42:31.149 --> 42:34.512
I didn't see any rats. Just toys.

42:35.720 --> 42:39.289
Move away from my daughter, mister,
or I'm gonna rearrange your face!

42:39.290 --> 42:40.524
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

42:40.525 --> 42:43.727
Well, why don't...
Why don't you and I go look for the girl?

42:43.728 --> 42:46.930
If you think I'm going anywhere
with you, you're bloody crazy.

42:46.931 --> 42:49.166
And you are spending
the night in our room.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.034
- No, I won't.
- You heard me!

42:51.035 --> 42:53.470
I want to stay with Ralph.
He's my friend.

42:53.471 --> 42:56.003
I'll bet he is. Come on.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.244
Wait, Judy!

43:04.882 --> 43:08.185
Please, Enid. Give me five
minutes, please! That's all...

43:08.186 --> 43:09.978
Oh, God.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.652
Judith Anne!

43:26.003 --> 43:28.763
Get out here right now,
God damn it.

43:31.008 --> 43:35.304
If you don't come out right now,
I'm gonna rip this doll to shreds.

43:36.214 --> 43:38.006
You think I'm kidding?

43:38.816 --> 43:40.074
Okay.

43:58.336 --> 44:00.367
All right, funny man.

44:01.539 --> 44:05.072
Let's see just how
bright you can get.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.967
- Gabriel, thank goodness.
- Ralph, what's the matter?

44:30.968 --> 44:33.069
One of the girls is missing,
and there's...

44:33.070 --> 44:35.272
- On the living room, on the carpet.
- I know.

44:35.273 --> 44:38.008
Please, don't say anything
about it to anybody at all.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.177
Hilary will be so cross.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.279
Yeah, I bet she will.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.115
And just for the record,
what are you talking about?

44:45.116 --> 44:48.351
I spilled a can of paint.
I use it to paint the dolls' cheeks.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.487
I wanted to touch up
some of the older ones.

44:50.488 --> 44:53.857
- I'll go get the mop.
- Wait. Paint? You spilled paint?

44:53.858 --> 44:56.493
Yes, I do some of my
best work at night.

44:56.494 --> 44:57.861
Now, about that girl...

44:57.862 --> 45:01.691
Judy saw her getting dragged
away by the elves.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.467
- And you believed her?
- Yeah. Well, no.

45:04.468 --> 45:05.769
Congratulations, Ralph.

45:05.770 --> 45:08.271
We'll wake up that child
that's inside you, yet.

45:08.272 --> 45:09.539
Don't worry about the girl.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.709
She's probably got lost in one of
the wings in this old mausoleum.

45:12.710 --> 45:16.869
If she hasn't turned up by breakfast
time, I'll go and find her.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.645
What are you doing?

46:01.859 --> 46:04.789
I'm just washing some
of this blood off.

46:05.363 --> 46:07.053
There you are.

46:13.404 --> 46:15.629
Boy, they really broke the skin.

46:16.540 --> 46:19.732
- With my luck, they're rabid.
- I like rabbits.

46:23.014 --> 46:27.173
Judy, your father's gonna kill you
if he catches you down here with me.

46:27.284 --> 46:30.146
Worse yet,
he's probably gonna kill me.

46:30.254 --> 46:33.189
Ralph, what do you
think we should do?

46:33.190 --> 46:34.391
About Isabel?

46:34.392 --> 46:37.083
No, about the longest
night in the world.

46:45.703 --> 46:48.633
Do you know something
that I don't know?

46:51.542 --> 46:53.107
I guess I do.

46:54.645 --> 46:58.008
Honey, I wish I knew
what you were talking about.

46:59.450 --> 47:01.345
You know, Ralph.

47:01.652 --> 47:05.288
Deep down inside, you know.

47:19.403 --> 47:20.695
Shit.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.837
Isabel.

50:22.987 --> 50:25.955
<i>Hush-a-bye, baby</i>

50:25.956 --> 50:28.647
<i>On the tree top</i>

51:38.529 --> 51:40.356
Oh, Jesus!

51:45.202 --> 51:47.529
Stop buggering around.

51:49.006 --> 51:50.696
Is that you Isabel?

51:55.279 --> 51:57.106
Are you all right?

51:57.247 --> 51:58.573
Go back.

51:58.982 --> 52:00.672
What's the matter?

52:12.196 --> 52:13.624
Are you hurt?

52:26.477 --> 52:28.577
Oh, my God!

52:29.246 --> 52:30.813
Who did this to you?

52:30.814 --> 52:32.208
Go back.

52:32.916 --> 52:34.413
Please.

52:51.969 --> 52:54.228
Oh, my God!

53:06.483 --> 53:09.049
Oh, my God! The kid was right.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.917
The little people.
They're fucking dolls.

53:55.299 --> 53:56.830
Mama.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.070
Don't worry, I'll be back!

54:20.924 --> 54:23.626
Okay, soldier boys,
come and get it.

54:23.627 --> 54:27.957
And I'll give you a hotfoot all the
way up to your pointed little heads!

55:40.037 --> 55:41.704
Are you asleep?

55:43.140 --> 55:45.934
Wait till I get my
hands on that kid.

55:46.710 --> 55:50.402
Sent me on a wild-goose chase
all over this fun house.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.963
I think I'll take a shower
before I hit the hay.

56:17.107 --> 56:18.569
Don't get up.

56:26.149 --> 56:28.544
- You're sure they're in there?
- Yeah.

56:28.585 --> 56:31.253
- Little people?
- Very little.

56:33.056 --> 56:37.022
With my luck, it's probably
a lost tribe of pygmies...

56:37.995 --> 56:39.492
with blowguns.

56:46.570 --> 56:49.671
It's locked.
Let's just try someplace else.

56:59.149 --> 57:02.284
Are you sure these
little people are kids?

57:02.285 --> 57:04.077
Not exactly.

57:15.465 --> 57:17.394
Turn on the light.

57:17.401 --> 57:19.728
I can't find the light switch.

57:22.673 --> 57:25.740
Maybe there's a light
at the other end of the room.

57:26.076 --> 57:28.801
Gabriel said this was a
storage room, right?

57:33.717 --> 57:37.586
- Probably just the wind.
- Just the wind.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.277
Right.

57:47.831 --> 57:49.521
Here it is.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.935
It's a hanging light.

58:06.516 --> 58:08.707
Look at these dollies.

58:13.123 --> 58:15.157
What detail!

58:15.158 --> 58:17.087
Hello, little people.

58:22.365 --> 58:25.033
These aren't your little people,
are they?

58:29.573 --> 58:32.508
They're just ordinary dolls
that Gabriel made, aren't they?

58:32.509 --> 58:34.108
I guess.

58:42.085 --> 58:44.378
- Judy?
- Yes, Ralph?

58:44.521 --> 58:46.052
These dolls...

58:47.924 --> 58:49.921
they're alive, aren't they?

58:51.728 --> 58:52.928
Sure they are.

58:52.929 --> 58:55.931
Remember when you talked about
toys coming to life at night?

58:55.932 --> 59:00.262
But, Judy,
that was just a little story.

59:00.804 --> 59:02.505
A true story.

59:02.506 --> 59:05.808
- Why don't we get out of here?
- I don't think they'd like that.

59:05.809 --> 59:09.001
Yeah? Well, the hell with them!

59:09.112 --> 59:12.440
Let's go!

59:14.284 --> 59:17.942
Ralph, stop!
You're making them angry, Ralph!

59:18.088 --> 59:21.257
I'm offending the toys?
Excuse me!

59:22.526 --> 59:23.784
Sorry.

59:28.431 --> 59:29.928
Excuse me.

59:38.942 --> 59:41.474
Run, Judy!

59:46.283 --> 59:48.110
Stop it! Help!

59:49.920 --> 59:53.851
No! Leave him alone! Stop it!

59:58.628 --> 01:00:01.330
Why are you doing
this to my friend?

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.863
You're bad dollies! Bad!

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.761
Leave him alone!

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.209
Ralph, are you okay?

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.516
- We got to get out of here.
- Not right now.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:21.750
Why not?

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:25.182
They won't let us. They're
deciding what to do with us.

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:29.458
Oh, great.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.093
Don't worry.
Mr. Punch will protect us.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:55.242
Come on, baby. Let's not let this
place spoil our whole vacation, okay?

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.512
Will Mommy kiss Daddy
and make it all better?

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:05.494
Please, Mommy? Don't punish Daddy.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:09.529
Come on, give him a big, wet one.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.062
Oh, God!

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.454
That Ralph guy did this,
didn't he?

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.021
That psychotic piece of shit!

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.949
I'll kill him!

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.894
What's going on now?

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:54.839
They're trying to decide if you're really
an adult, or just a kid in disguise.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.608
I've been trying to figure
that out for years.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.186
Thank you.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.995
We can go now.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:27.009
- I must be hallucinating.
- If that means dreaming, you're not.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.911
- But how...
- You!

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.546
You're dead meat!

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.582
- Your father sounds upset.
- He looks upset, too.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.452
- You killed Rosemary.
- No, he didn't.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.154
- Yeah. No, he didn't.
- Then who did?

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:41.721
I don't know. The little people?

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:54.203
Daddy, don't! Please!

01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:57.133
Daddy, no!

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:06.682
- What do we have, a hero now?
- Yes, he is a hero!

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:09.451
He's probably a prince in disguise
or something.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:12.588
But even if he's not,
he's nicer than you'll ever be.

01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:16.492
Don't! Do me a favor. Just stand
there, okay? Very, very quietly.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.126
Hi. Can we talk?

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:22.331
I swear to God, there are some crazy
toys down there that can kill people.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.565
Don't hand me that shit!

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.468
Honest! I wouldn't have believed
it if I hadn't seen it...

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.193
- but they captured me!
- Yeah?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.129
- Then why didn't they kill you?
- I'm young at heart, I guess?

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.006
Daddy, don't!

01:05:22.886 --> 01:05:25.384
Fuck you, clownie!

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:31.151
Such language.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.291
And such a temper.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.826
What a mess you have
made down here.

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:47.873
Just look what he's done
to Judy's good friend, Mr. Punch.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.609
I'll do the same to you,
you old witch.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.977
- He figured it out.
- A lucky guess, that's all.

01:05:57.854 --> 01:05:59.688
- Where's my daughter?
- She's safe.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.117
With friends.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:05.160
It's past her bedtime. She should
be dreaming sweet dreams by now.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:06.628
I want her back.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.331
She belongs in a juvenile home,
that little punk.

01:06:09.332 --> 01:06:13.035
Helping that murderer.
Come on, hand her over. She's my kid!

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:16.728
Being a parent is a privilege,
David, not a right.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.674
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:21.708
Such persistently
quaint terminology.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:24.572
Don't worry.
Everything can be repaired.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.439
Oh, yeah?

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:28.650
Fix this, old man.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:31.486
It's a hunk of junk.

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.622
It's junk!

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.951
Yes, I'll fix him, David,
with your help.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.162
You can destroy as
many toys as you like.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.531
But you can't get rid of them all.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:45.895
Toys will be here for as
long as children want them.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.865
They're the heart and
soul of childhood.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:52.441
Hilary and I think that the
bitterness people feel as adults...

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:56.942
can turn to love if they surrender
to the goodwill toys provide.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.014
Some people could be saved.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.410
We give everyone a sporting chance.

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:04.514
But the others, like you?

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.784
Well, they have to start over...

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:10.424
and play a new role
in the big game.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:17.566
And you still don't know
what's happening, do you?

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:19.534
You silly Mr. Punch.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:23.466
Mischievous Mr. Punch.
Always making trouble.

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:56.872
What a little dickens you can be,
my little Punch.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.573
I must admit...

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:02.005
you do look spiffier
in your more contemporary clothing.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.510
I don't know.

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:08.949
Don't you think it clashes
with his more modern getup?

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:26.033
You're awake. Good.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.770
Steady now. You've had an
awful crack on the noggin.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.232
One of the dolls.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:35.970
The dolls.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:41.182
The killer dolls!

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.173
The what?

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:46.921
Oh, dear. I do hope he
hasn't got a concussion.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.322
Welcome back, my dear.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:53.761
Mr. Gabriel? What happened?

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:56.765
Last night, after dinner,
you two disappeared on us.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:09:00.102
We looked high and low for you
but we couldn't find you anywhere.

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:03.904
Then we thought you might be outside
trying to get Ralph's motorcar started.

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.403
So we went out.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.769
By the way, we managed to get
your car out of the mud for you.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.381
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:15.082
When we came back,
the house was quite empty.

01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:19.453
Eventually I found you in my storage
room. I thought I'd locked it.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:22.557
By the way, you must have knocked
all my dolls off the shelves.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.487
You were out cold.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.130
How long have we been unconscious?

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:32.334
About three hours. In truth, I think
you were asleep most of the time.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.332
You seemed exhausted.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.902
Where's my daddy?

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:41.042
Well, I hate to have to be the one
to tell you this, my dear...

01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:43.612
but your daddy has
gone on without you.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.913
No, that doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:49.209
Adults seldom do.
Your father left a note.

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:51.545
Allow me, my dear.

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:55.089
"Dear Judy, forgive me.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:58.053
"I never was a good father, I know.

01:09:58.294 --> 01:10:00.896
"Rosemary and I are
leaving you here...

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:04.041
"with a hope that you will have
a much happier life living

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:05.616
with your mother, not us.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:10.301
"We are moving to another country
and changing our names.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.809
"We are leaving you enough money
for a plane ticket back to Boston.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.777
"Love, your father."

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.380
He won't be back ever?

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.708
No, I'm afraid not, my dear.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.018
There, there.

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:25.881
Some people just don't cut out
to be daddies.

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:30.058
He thought that the best, the
grandest thing he could do for you...

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:34.525
was to allow you to grow up in a
household of love with your mommy.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.951
What about the two girls?
My hitchhikers?

01:10:38.952 --> 01:10:39.724
Yes.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:41.969
P.S.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:45.472
"I am taking the two
hitchhikers with me."

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:47.969
Let me...

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.983
Her father asked that you make sure
that Judy gets back to Boston.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.018
But I don't have
that kind of money.

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:59.915
He left you the money for
a plane ticket, too.

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:04.459
That's funny, because he didn't
seem that generous to me.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.329
I can't believe all this
was just a nightmare.

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:12.058
There's a saying in my family that
sometimes bad dreams can be good for you.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:18.769
It's time we were heading back
to the real world.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.574
Like, now.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.780
- Will you be all right to drive?
- Oh, yeah. I'm raring to go.

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:28.650
You know, you don't have to go
if you don't want to.

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.342
We've grown quite fond of you.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:36.390
A child, and a child at heart.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:39.461
You can stay here and
play with our toys...

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.493
for as long as you like.

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:44.099
For as long as there
are toys to play with.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.701
Gee, thanks,
but my mom would be worried.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:50.405
Is it okay if we come back and
visit you next summer vacation?

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.908
Of course, darling.
It will be our pleasure.

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:54.776
Write to us in advance, dear...

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.412
and we'll get the house
all dolled up for you.

01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:00.138
I think it's time
we should be going.

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:05.887
Thank you.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:08.356
Where's Mr. Punch?
I want to say goodbye.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.959
I was just going to
put Mr. Punch to bed.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.494
He's very tired after
such a long, long night.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:18.695
The longest night in the world.

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.774
See you next summer.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.378
So long, short stuff.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.375
Let's go.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:39.248
Let's get out of here.
This place is getting real creepy.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.328
What's this?

01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:50.031
That's Teddy! He's my best friend.
Next to you, I mean.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.866
Rosemary threw him away.

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:55.270
- But what's he doing in here?
- Remember what Mr. Gabriel said?

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:56.460
No.

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:59.532
"Toys are loyal.
And that's a fact."

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:05.140
- Wait a minute, Ralph.
- Judy, no!

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.515
Mr. Gabriel, I think...

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.680
I think Teddy would like it here
with all the other dolls.

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:21.563
I think perhaps that's
a very good idea.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.699
We'll treat him as if he were
one of our own, dear heart.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.004
And he'll be here waiting for you in case
you should ever decide to come back.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:30.934
- Bye. Let's go.
- Bye.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.753
- Ralph, are you married?
- No.

01:13:44.754 --> 01:13:48.685
- Ever wanted to be?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.586
- Have you ever been to Boston?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:55.161
You'll like my mother.
She's young and very pretty.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:58.867
- Ralph?
- Yes, Judy?

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:01.059
Ever wanted a daughter?

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.591
Damn it!

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.609
Sit down!

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.735
All right, let's hear it.
What are we gonna do?

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:08.737
- You see a bus anywhere?
- Just relax.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:10.735
I don't believe this!

01:15:13.476 --> 01:15:16.440
Look.
There's a house over there.
