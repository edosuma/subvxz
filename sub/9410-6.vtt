[ Chuckles ]
That's what you said about worms.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.700
I know, but fish are way better.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.900
They've been around
for millions of years.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.167
They can breathe underwater, survive
under polar ice caps or in tropical heat.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.300
They probably don't even
have to sleep.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.633
How are we supposed to make
a science project out of fish?

20:06.633 --> 20:08.533
We need a few experiments.

20:08.533 --> 20:11.533
How long can fish live in
hot water or cold water?

20:11.533 --> 20:14.600
How long can a freshwater fish
survive in salt water? Stuff like that.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.600
Isn't that kinda cruel? I mean,
like, making them suffer like that?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.533
Don't be such a baby.
We've gotta be scientific about this.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.800
I'm telling you,
fish can't feel anything.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.267
- [ Reel Spinning ]
- All right! I got one!

20:26.267 --> 20:28.833
Yeah, easy. Easy!

20:29.333 --> 20:30.767
Aw, nuts! Got away.

20:30.767 --> 20:33.200
- Took my bait too.
- I hope I catch one.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.200
Can't wait to start my experiment.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.667
So, what are we gonna call
this fish experiment?

20:37.667 --> 20:41.200
"Fish: Nature's Survivors."

20:41.200 --> 20:44.267
I'm gonna have a bite
of your sandwich, okay?

20:44.267 --> 20:46.833
- My sandwich?
- I thought it was your sandwich.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.800
[ Screaming ]

20:50.800 --> 20:52.933
- Todd!
- [ Splash ]

20:54.100 --> 20:58.200
Danny, help!
They've got me! I'm hooked!

20:58.200 --> 21:02.667
Guys, come on. I was just kidding.
I'll give up fishing, I promise.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.100
I'm too small!
You gotta throw me back!

21:05.100 --> 21:08.100
You guys look like nice fish.
Please let me go?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.600
- [ Splashing, Sloshing ]
- Thanks!

21:10.600 --> 21:13.900
What?
You're gonna make me swim back?

21:15.333 --> 21:17.600
