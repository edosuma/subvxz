00:03.713 --> 00:06.580
You gotta trust me.
I am trying to help you.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.666
- Do I know you?
- I'm George Minkowski.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.752
- Communications officer.
- Where is the radio room?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.963
I'll take you there.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.514
How do we get out of here?

00:17.602 --> 00:20.014
Through the door.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.937
Looks like you guys
have a friend on this boat.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.811
You're pregnant?

00:27.361 --> 00:31.104
Juliet. She was their fertility doctor
studying pregnant women.

00:31.199 --> 00:35.317
The reason the Others wanted her baby
was for research.

00:35.411 --> 00:39.450
- What happens to pregnant women?
- They die.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.703
You want me to help you and your baby.
l have answers.

00:42.793 --> 00:46.536
- But you have to come with me now.
- The baby isn't Jin's.

00:48.549 --> 00:52.667
I'm gonna determine the date of
conception. If you got pregnant here...

00:54.305 --> 00:56.261
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:56.349 --> 01:00.888
The baby was conceived eight weeks ago.
You got pregnant on the island.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.515
So how long do l have?

01:05.316 --> 01:09.309
Most of the women made it into
the middle of their second trimester.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.359
Nobody made it to their third.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.957
[man] Lapidus!

01:39.141 --> 01:40.642
You ready?

01:41.686 --> 01:43.017
I'll be up.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.350
Don't be late, Frank.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.534
- Regina.
- Frank.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.993
- I didn't hear you.
- Sorry. Didn't mean to spook ya.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.874
The captain wanted me to bring
these guys some grub.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.872
OK.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.379
You know, your book's upside down.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.768

02:32.069 --> 02:35.778
Thought I'd check in on you guys,
bring you some food.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.982
- How you feeling, by the way?
- Much better, thanks.

02:39.076 --> 02:43.069
Why are we held captive? We had nothing
to do with Minkowski's death.

02:43.164 --> 02:48.500
Nothing to do with Minkowski. Captain
wasn't happy you busted out of sick bay

02:48.586 --> 02:50.952
- and into our radio room.
- We didn't bust out.

02:51.047 --> 02:53.459
The door was left open.

02:53.591 --> 02:57.049
- And we assumed it was you.
- Why the hell would I do that?

02:58.429 --> 03:00.761
Any contact
with our people on the beach?

03:01.599 --> 03:04.511
No luck. Something
must've happened to their phone.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.065
Sorry, we had a problem
in the kitchen.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.567
Just stay put, all right?

03:17.448 --> 03:19.439
I still want to talk to the captain.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.494
No, you don't.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.949
- Regina.

the redhead knocked me out?

08:15.329 --> 08:16.535
She hit you?

08:16.622 --> 08:19.830
When I ran into them
on my way back from Locke's camp.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.157
Why would she do that?

08:22.336 --> 08:26.875
Guess she didn't want to explain why she
was on her way to a poison gas factory.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.295
Juliet told Jack it was a power station.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.386
Why would Juliet lie about that?

08:34.473 --> 08:35.679
Force of habit.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.346
- Why were they going there?
- To turn it off.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.804
Deactivate the gas. They wanted
to earn some brownie points.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.894
Do you think they're
really going to rescue us?

08:49.988 --> 08:52.855
In the time they've been here,
they've talked about a lot.

08:52.950 --> 08:56.238

10:34.259 --> 10:38.127
- Congratulations.
- So you're here to rescue us?

10:42.601 --> 10:44.717
It's a simple question.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.936
Are you or are you not
going to rescue us?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.061
The thing is, um...

10:54.363 --> 10:56.524
...it's not really my call, Sun.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.444
Then whose call is it?

11:03.747 --> 11:05.248
Thank you.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.617
Can you pass the cereal?

Would you like some breakfast?

12:43.388 --> 12:44.924
What are you doing?

12:47.684 --> 12:51.393
I needed another bottle
of those vitamins you gave me.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.938
- The prenatals.
- You could have just asked.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.607
You're right. I should have.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.810
What happened to the

- We're going to Locke's camp.
- What?

13:23.178 --> 13:26.762
- Why?
- Because I don't trust these people.

Whether you trust them or not,
you can't go.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.304
they don't survive here.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.147
Yes, you did tell me that.

You don't believe me?

13:42.906 --> 13:46.615
Look, I know I've
been less than truthful

13:46.743 --> 13:51.077
about certain things since coming here,
but I promise you, Sun, I promise you,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.416
I'm not lying about this.

13:55.460 --> 13:59.749

...what might best be described
as a heightened case of cabin fever.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.621
It's got to do with
the close proximity of the island.

- I've tried.

25:51.342 --> 25:56.052
- And then you'll take our people home?
- Then we move to safer waters.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.596
- My orders.
- I don't suppose you will tell us

25:58.683 --> 26:02.801
- who gave you those orders?
- Sure, lwill. Charles Widmore.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.432
This is Charles Widmore's boat?

26:10.319 --> 26:12.105
That's right. You know him.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.253
Do either of you know what this is?

26:31.340 --> 26:34.798
It's a flight data recorder.
Othenivise known as a black box.

26:35.470 --> 26:38.177
That's exactly what it is.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.550
Now, here's the funny thing.

26:40.641 --> 26:44.850
This black box comes
from Oceanic flight 815.

26:48.441 --> 26:51.933
A salvage vessel recovered it
from the bottom of the ocean.

26:52.028 --> 26:56.897
It took a considerable amount of
Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.482
It was found
with the wreckage of the plane,

26:59.577 --> 27:02.239
along with all 324 dead passengers.

27:06.209 --> 27:09.292
Not the complete story,
as you are aware, Mr. Jarrah,

27:09.378 --> 27:12.506
given the fact
that you are standing here. Breathing.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.716
The wreckage was obviously staged.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.970
Now, can you imagine
what kind of resources and manpower

27:21.057 --> 27:23.890
go into pulling off a feat
of that magnitude?

27:23.976 --> 27:26.353
Faking the recovery of a plane crash?

27:28.481 --> 27:33.066
Putting 324 families through
a grieving process based on a lie?

27:34.529 --> 27:36.611
But what's even more disturbing...

27:36.697 --> 27:42.192
Where exactly does one
come across 324 dead bodies?

27:44.121 --> 27:46.658
And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume,

27:46.749 --> 27:50.913
is just one of the many reasons
we want Benjamin Linus.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.055
[Juliet] I'm sorry.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.223
I had to stop you any way I could.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.232
It wasn't your place to stop us.

28:16.070 --> 28:20.484
I know you don't trust me, but you need
to get off this island. We all do.

28:21.617 --> 28:25.326
- You want to leave?
- More than anything.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.957
I don't know if that boat out there
is the answer, but it's something.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.499
I need to go home, and so do you.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.710
Sun...

28:40.845 --> 28:45.214
In about three weeks, you'll be
in an almost constant state of nausea.

28:45.308 --> 28:49.972
A week after, you'll experience
shortness of breath that won't go away.

28:50.104 --> 28:54.814
A week after that, you'll lose
consciousness and slip into a coma.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.642
And then, Sun, you will die.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.485
And when your heart stops beating,

29:03.618 --> 29:05.358
so will the baby's.

29:07.997 --> 29:13.537
And that, Sun, is why it's my business.
Because you're my patient.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.959
If you go...

29:20.718 --> 29:22.504
...you will die.

29:24.847 --> 29:27.179
And your baby will never be born.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.981
[man shouting]

30:30.454 --> 30:32.445
[baby crying]

31:33.476 --> 31:35.888
So, what did you think of the captain?

31:35.978 --> 31:39.891
- He was surprisingly forthcoming.
- Yeah, he tells it like it is.

31:39.982 --> 31:43.145
Just don't piss him off,
know what I mean?

31:43.277 --> 31:47.316
I think you'll like your room.
It's on the quiet part of the ship.

31:47.448 --> 31:50.861
- The ship isn't moving.
- If you say so.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.502
That shouldn't still be there. Damn it.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.962
Hey, Johnson! Is that you?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.962
-Johnson!
- Yeah?

32:13.057 --> 32:15.048
Mop this up.

32:15.184 --> 32:19.598
- Sorry. I gotta go up on deck.
- No. You're gonna mop this up.

32:43.546 --> 32:47.209
- Kevin? This is...
- Sayid.

32:49.552 --> 32:52.385
- Desmond.
- Kevin Johnson.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.339
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.248
I made dinner.

35:35.884 --> 35:40.423
Is the baby... mine?

36:33.108 --> 36:35.770
[no audio]

38:25.721 --> 38:27.757
[doorbell rings]

38:43.572 --> 38:44.937
[chuckles]

38:47.159 --> 38:49.241
I can't believe you came all this way.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.195
Are you kidding?
Is anyone else coming?

38:52.748 --> 38:55.160
- No.
- Good.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.375
So where is she?

39:01.548 --> 39:04.335
[cooing]

39:06.303 --> 39:09.340
- She's awesome.
- Thank you.

39:12.434 --> 39:15.096
Would you like to hold her?

39:15.187 --> 39:18.099
I don't know.
I kind of have two left hands.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.976
I trust you.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.819
Wow.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.026
She looks just like Jin.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.701
Yes. She does.

39:40.087 --> 39:44.251
So I guess we should,
like, go see him.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.041
Of course.
