I haven't seen her.

What the hell does she
talk to you about, anyway?

21:56.840 --> 21:59.070
So now you're curious.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.629
For someone who wants to be helpful,

22:01.720 --> 22:05.600
you're doing a pretty shit job of it.

Nothing, really.

Other times,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.357
how much she misses her Uncle Daryl.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.750
She likes hearing stories about her dad.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.036
- And Carl.
- So you feed her bullshit.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.353
She'd smoke out the bullshit,
you know that.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.874
I let her know

22:24.960 --> 22:28.999
that she's just as much a badass
as Carl was.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.879
How he got into the Sanctuary

They're all old stories, Michonne,

22:41.360 --> 22:42.919
-but they are new to her.
- Mm.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.911
And you tell her these things why?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.832
Because you know that I haven't?

22:46.920 --> 22:50.117
Or because you're trying to earn
some sort of trust with her?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.316
Something that you can use?

22:52.400 --> 22:54.710
- She likes listening to me talk.
- You like hearing yourself talk.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.711
So we have that in common.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.757
[Chuckles] The point is,

22:58.840 --> 23:00.274
she comes down here to talk to me

23:00.360 --> 23:02.397
because I shoot straight with her.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.278
And now, maybe if you did that,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.516
you'd be talking to her right
now instead of me.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.119
To Abraham?

23:18.200 --> 23:21.318
Yeah, I didn't think so.

letting new people in.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.479

-in the letter that he wrote to her.

about how things should be.

because you're curious.

You came down here because
you have no idea where she is.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.872
Maybe she's off petting a horse.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.669

exactly like her mother,

33:14.880 --> 33:17.269
Judith! Back off!

33:17.360 --> 33:18.555
[Screams]

33:18.680 --> 33:20.398
I didn't know it was
going to be you, Michonne.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.118
I'm truly sorry that it is.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.874
It was just... fate.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.793

[Groaning softly]

33:56.440 --> 34:00.957
[Groans]

34:01.040 --> 34:05.352
You can all come back to Alexandria.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.359
We'll take care of you now.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.676
Kill all of her children.
The rest of you are with me.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.070
No! No! Stop it!

No! Stop!

Winnie!

35:10.120 --> 35:14.910
[Voice breaking] Winnie...

35:15.000 --> 35:16.877
please...

35:16.960 --> 35:20.715
don't.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.472
[Door creaks]

35:40.360 --> 35:45.275
[Breathing heavily]

35:45.360 --> 35:48.751
[Voice breaking] Judith...

35:48.840 --> 35:51.354
Judith...

36:07.360 --> 36:09.874
Mommy!

[Sniffling]

36:18.720 --> 36:20.950
Hi. You okay?

36:21.040 --> 36:23.680
Oh. Are you okay?

36:23.760 --> 36:25.592
Hi, guys. Hi.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.069
[Speaking indistinctly]

[Walkers growling]

Mommy, help!

36:53.720 --> 36:55.074
_Mommy~ help!
"No! I

Mommy! No!

[Grunts]

36:58.920 --> 37:02.038
[Breathing heavily]

37:06.160 --> 37:11.155
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:11.240 --> 37:14.756
We need to talk.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.117
[Breathing heavily]

37:31.000 --> 37:34.516
Michonne: I was standing right there,

37:34.600 --> 37:38.594
and it was like you didn't know me.

37:38.680 --> 37:41.559
For a second, I thought...

37:43.120 --> 37:45.919
I thought I was too late.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.274
[Sniffles]

37:48.480 --> 37:51.154
I thought...

37:51.240 --> 37:56.110
that you'd changed and that I'd lost you.

37:57.920 --> 38:01.231
You didn't look like you.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.834
Because of the blood.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.639
But then I saw it was.

38:06.760 --> 38:10.116
And I was happy you'd found me.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.791
You remember that?

38:16.800 --> 38:19.269
What else?

38:20.920 --> 38:22.638
Jocelyn.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.199
Her kids.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.836
They were nice to us the whole time.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.709
I remember they made it all
seem like a game,

38:31.800 --> 38:33.871
so we went with them.

38:33.960 --> 38:37.635
But she was a bad person.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.075
They all were.

38:40.160 --> 38:43.994
It's why you did what you did.

38:45.080 --> 38:49.233
All this time,
I thought you didn't remember.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.880
I hoped you didn't.

38:51.960 --> 38:56.955
And you-- you never said
anything after that first year.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.873
Because it made you sad.

38:59.960 --> 39:02.873
[Breathes deeply]

39:02.960 --> 39:06.669
What I've done at home...

39:06.760 --> 39:10.958
I thought you didn't understand
because you didn't know.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.551
But you did.

39:14.640 --> 39:19.874
So how the hell are we here right now?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.640
Our friends need our help.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.475
Oh, Judith, it's not that simple.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.200
Yes, it is.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.191
You're my mom.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.476
You chose to be.

39:35.600 --> 39:39.275
Because you love me, and I love you.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.794
I do.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.917
And loving someone means
doing whatever it takes

39:43.000 --> 39:44.752
to keep them safe, right?

39:48.600 --> 39:51.513
But when did we stop loving Daryl?

39:51.600 --> 39:53.511
[Voice breaking] Aunt Maggie?

39:53.600 --> 39:56.513
Carol? The King?

39:58.120 --> 40:00.714
We-- We didn't.

40:04.320 --> 40:07.392
Then why does it feel that way?

40:25.840 --> 40:29.754
[indistinct shouting]

40:29.840 --> 40:31.353
Mommy!

40:52.800 --> 40:56.714
[Gate scraping lightly]

40:58.800 --> 41:01.599
[Insects chirping]

41:01.680 --> 41:05.469
Your father and I dug this together.

41:07.480 --> 41:12.395
And that day, standing right here,

41:12.480 --> 41:18.396
I made a promise to never
bury another child again.

41:18.480 --> 41:24.237
But then your father was gone...

41:24.320 --> 41:26.834
and I was...

41:26.960 --> 41:28.473
lost.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.914
And then you were lost.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.039
And I was scared.

41:40.120 --> 41:44.830
More scared than I have ever been

41:44.920 --> 41:48.117
before, or since.

41:51.080 --> 41:54.835
And I wasn't the only one.

41:54.920 --> 42:00.279
So we decided to make this place

42:00.360 --> 42:03.318
only about the people who lived here.

42:03.400 --> 42:07.280
And that's not what Carl or your dad

42:07.360 --> 42:11.433
gave their lives to create,

42:11.520 --> 42:15.434
but it kept you and RJ safe.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.951
That's what I wanted.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.996
That is all I wanted.

42:31.160 --> 42:36.314
[Crying, sniffles]

42:36.400 --> 42:38.676
You were right.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.834
[Sighs]

42:44.920 --> 42:47.514
We have to protect
the people we love.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.752
All the people we love.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.713
And we will.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.996
[Sighs]

43:28.240 --> 43:31.517
Do you think it'll leave a scar?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.954
No.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.475
But it's okay if it does.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.837
[Wheels screech]

43:45.920 --> 43:50.710
[Horses whinny]

43:50.800 --> 43:53.553
Anyone headed to Kingdom?

44:12.480 --> 44:15.711
[Growling]

44:24.480 --> 44:27.199
[Growling stops]

44:40.440 --> 44:43.831
We must tell Alpha.
