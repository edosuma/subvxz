00:06.417 --> 00:07.884
<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:07.918 --> 00:09.185
Did the kids hold you up?

00:09.220 --> 00:10.487
- Gini's got two.
- Oh.

00:10.521 --> 00:12.088
No, actually,
it was my ex-husband.

00:12.123 --> 00:13.290
He spent the night on the sofa.

00:13.324 --> 00:14.758
He's having
some financial issues.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.359
It's a long story.

00:19.797 --> 00:21.064
I wanted to give you this.

00:21.098 --> 00:22.432
I came up with the amount

00:22.466 --> 00:25.869
by, uh, adding up the times
we've... participated.

00:25.903 --> 00:27.871
Take the money.

00:27.905 --> 00:30.674
Hey.

00:30.708 --> 00:32.442
Do you want to be alone?

00:32.476 --> 00:34.411
Something has happened.

00:34.445 --> 00:35.679
You're pregnant.

00:37.948 --> 00:39.115
It's not possible.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.917
Did you think I wouldn't know?

00:40.951 --> 00:43.420
You're lucky I don't come after
your medical license.

00:43.454 --> 00:45.288
Unh!

00:45.323 --> 00:48.291
I capped Libby because you were
too selfish to do it yourself.

00:48.326 --> 00:50.226
You're finished
at this hospital.

00:50.261 --> 00:53.263
The university has
approved my pap smear proposal.

00:53.297 --> 00:55.198
$600.

00:55.232 --> 00:57.767
Not enough for lab
equipment or a proper staff.

00:57.802 --> 01:00.503
The rules are
different for men and women.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.105
Bill hit you?

01:02.139 --> 01:06.443
Uh, it has to do with Libby
and how she really got pregnant.

01:06.477 --> 01:07.677
Now I understand.

01:07.712 --> 01:10.680
It was never really
about the research.

01:10.715 --> 01:13.650
No. We were having an affair.

01:15.286 --> 01:17.454
I quit.

01:19.023 --> 01:21.791
I see
you still need a secretary.

Masters of Sex - 1x11
"Phallic Victories"

02:16.514 --> 02:19.649
Virginia!

02:19.683 --> 02:22.085
Do you mind
not bellowing for me?

02:22.119 --> 02:24.654
Where's the data for
the nulliparous-study subjects?

02:24.688 --> 02:26.556
I'm sorry. The what?

02:28.893 --> 02:30.026
Nulliparous--

02:30.060 --> 02:33.596
uh, women
who have never given birth.

02:33.631 --> 02:36.766
That's another one
for your vocabulary list.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.167
I haven't seen it.

02:38.202 --> 02:40.537
I can just go ask Virginia
where to find it--

02:40.571 --> 02:42.005
No, don't... do that.

02:42.039 --> 02:44.474
Oh, it's not a problem.
She's just down the hall.

02:44.508 --> 02:46.509
You're not
to involve her in any way.

02:48.212 --> 02:51.814
She's no longer an employee
of this office.

03:02.726 --> 03:04.394
Just let me confirm it
with the doctor,

03:04.428 --> 03:06.329
and I'll get right back to you.

03:06.363 --> 03:10.099
Yeah. Thank you, Hal,
for the opportunity.

03:14.271 --> 03:17.840
How long do you think it would
take you to make your case

03:17.875 --> 03:19.642
for pap smears
becoming standard procedure

03:19.677 --> 03:22.145
- in gynecological exams?
- How long?

03:22.179 --> 03:24.013
Well, so far,
it's been about three years.

03:24.048 --> 03:25.648
No, I mean in minutes.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.684
I just got off the phone
with Hal Fortner.

03:27.718 --> 03:29.352
The pharmaceutical rep?

03:29.386 --> 03:31.487
Mm-hmm.
His company is sponsoring

03:31.522 --> 03:34.357
a two-day, all-expenses-paid,
ob/gyn conference

03:34.391 --> 03:37.460
at some golfing resort
outside of Knoxville.

03:37.494 --> 03:40.229
Oh, God. One
of those medical boondoggles.

03:40.264 --> 03:42.432
Do not turn up your nose.

03:42.466 --> 03:47.303
I just got you the last
15-minute spot on the program.

03:47.338 --> 03:48.938
How did you manage that?

03:48.973 --> 03:51.307
The comedian dropped out.

03:51.342 --> 03:53.676
I told him
you had terrific patter.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.612
About cervical cancer?

03:55.646 --> 03:58.915
You go on after "New
techniques in breech births"

03:58.949 --> 04:03.286
and before 125 country doctors
hit the links.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.421
That is your target audience,
isn't it?

04:06.757 --> 04:10.259
How does a man
save a woman from drowning?

04:10.294 --> 04:11.694
What?

04:11.729 --> 04:14.063
He takes his foot off her head.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.399
That's the only joke I know.

04:17.434 --> 04:19.836
I don't think you're
gonna have to try to be funny.

04:19.870 --> 04:22.739
No, you just have to show up
and try to change a few minds.

04:22.773 --> 04:24.774
Well, you know men.

04:24.808 --> 04:28.177
It's easier to change
their diapers than their minds.

04:28.212 --> 04:29.712
Two. That's two.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.881
Yeah, but, really, don't.

04:31.915 --> 04:34.617
It's not doing you any favors.

04:34.652 --> 04:36.719
And you'll come with me?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.788
It'd be helpful
to have some assistance.

04:38.822 --> 04:41.524
I can't really do
an overnight. I-I have my kids.

04:41.558 --> 04:43.192
Can't you leave them alone?

04:43.227 --> 04:44.494
They're 6 and 8.

04:44.528 --> 04:47.230
Can't you leave them
with someone?

04:47.264 --> 04:48.297
Angela.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.434
Angela has children.

04:51.468 --> 04:53.603
Angela has cocker spaniels.

04:54.872 --> 04:56.773
Well, they're alive,
aren't they?

04:56.807 --> 04:58.841
She obviously knows
how to take care of them.

04:58.876 --> 05:02.578
It's a joke.
Another joke.

05:13.223 --> 05:14.891
Excuse me.

05:14.925 --> 05:17.794
Nulliparous are women
who have never given birth.

05:17.828 --> 05:19.729
Well, yes.

05:19.763 --> 05:21.064
Obviously.

05:21.098 --> 05:22.432
Um, but where would he--

05:22.466 --> 05:23.900
It's under P for "Para."

05:23.934 --> 05:25.935
Para 0 is never having
carried a child.

05:25.969 --> 05:28.337
Para 1 is one pregnancy,
para 2 is two, and so on.

05:28.372 --> 05:29.839
Why is he asking for that?

05:29.873 --> 05:32.308
I think for the
introduction to the presentation.

05:32.342 --> 05:34.677
He's talking about the range
of study subjects.

05:34.712 --> 05:38.347
No. Do not let him spend
too much time on methodology, Jane.

05:38.382 --> 05:40.450
He gets bogged down
by statistical data.

05:40.484 --> 05:41.851
I'm always telling him...

05:41.885 --> 05:43.886
I <i>used</i> to tell him.

05:43.921 --> 05:46.022
Don't make it sound
like it's coming from me,

05:46.056 --> 05:47.523
but keep him calm, you know?

05:47.558 --> 05:48.991
It's a big part of the job,

05:49.026 --> 05:51.828
preventing Bill from becoming
his own worst enemy.

05:51.862 --> 05:53.663
I don't know, Virginia.

05:53.697 --> 05:56.466
He doesn't really listen to me
the way he listened to you.

05:58.569 --> 06:01.971
# <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i> #

06:02.005 --> 06:05.141
# <i>which nobody can deny</i> #

06:05.175 --> 06:08.377
Speech! Speech!

06:08.412 --> 06:10.813
Okay! Okay.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.916
I was kind of hoping
that I'd slip out of here today

06:13.951 --> 06:15.885
without anyone making a fuss.

06:15.919 --> 06:17.553
But...

06:17.588 --> 06:19.522
now I'm glad you did.

06:19.556 --> 06:23.493
Because it gives me
an opportunity to say thank you.

06:23.527 --> 06:25.828
Working with you people
the past two years,

06:25.863 --> 06:27.363
it's made me a better doctor.

06:27.397 --> 06:30.199
And I think it's made me
a better friend.

06:30.234 --> 06:34.504
And I know
it's made me a better man.

06:40.711 --> 06:42.979
Until we meet again.

06:45.315 --> 06:49.118
Thank you.

06:49.153 --> 06:50.620
What are you doing here?

06:51.955 --> 06:54.390
Couldn't miss your send-off...

06:54.424 --> 06:57.960
seeing as how...
I'm responsible for it.

06:57.995 --> 07:00.129
- I feel terrible, Ethan.
- No, you-- Libby, don't.

07:00.164 --> 07:01.464
Y-you didn't ask me to do

07:01.498 --> 07:04.233
anything
that I wasn't willing to do.

07:04.268 --> 07:06.469
And, in the end,
we both came out ahead.

07:06.503 --> 07:08.504
<i>- Both</i> of us?
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.539 --> 07:11.007
I know that I did, but... you?

07:11.041 --> 07:14.377
No, it's a fresh start
for me, a clean slate.

07:14.411 --> 07:16.846
Have you been reading
Norman Vincent Peale?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.448
No, I'm not
just putting on a brave face.

07:19.483 --> 07:22.618
It's the right time for me
to go. I've accepted that.

07:22.653 --> 07:25.288
You know, there's no repairing
my relationship with Bill.

07:25.322 --> 07:27.223
- Well--
- And there's nothing

07:27.257 --> 07:29.592
for you to do about that, Libby.

07:29.626 --> 07:33.563
I am going to end up
in a great hospital

07:33.597 --> 07:35.698
that appreciates me
for my doctoring,

07:35.732 --> 07:37.633
not because I'm Bill's protégé.

07:37.668 --> 07:40.803
You know, your husband...

07:40.838 --> 07:43.139
casts a long shadow.

07:43.173 --> 07:46.175
It feels good to finally walk
out into the light.

07:48.045 --> 07:49.645
- You know what also helps?
- Hmm?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.681
- Being in love.
- Ethan!

07:51.715 --> 07:53.716
You're in love?
With whom?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.885
Bill didn't say anything?

08:02.626 --> 08:03.860
Knock, knock.

08:03.894 --> 08:05.361
Mrs. Masters.

08:05.395 --> 08:07.763
And another thing, Vir-- Jane!

08:07.798 --> 08:09.966
That's what he calls me
these days.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.167
This section you just typed

08:11.201 --> 08:14.470
contains 11 references
to sexual "intermission."

08:14.504 --> 08:17.473
- Okay...
- It's "intromission"!

08:17.507 --> 08:19.108
An intermission
is something happens

08:19.142 --> 08:21.143
halfway through
"gone with the wind"!

08:21.178 --> 08:24.046
Mrs. Masters is here, sir.

08:24.081 --> 08:26.182
Sorry.
We're really scrambling here.

08:26.216 --> 08:29.151
So much information to organize
for the presentation,

08:29.186 --> 08:31.520
plus there's this
whole visual component.

08:31.555 --> 08:32.788
Oh, my God!

08:32.823 --> 08:35.124
Professor Ladetto's been on hold
for 10 minutes.

08:35.158 --> 08:36.458
Shoot.

08:36.493 --> 08:38.760
Lib. What are you doing here?

08:38.794 --> 08:40.596
He hung up.
Should I get him back?

08:40.631 --> 08:42.265
I don't have time for him.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.332
I told you already--

08:43.366 --> 08:45.101
put everyone off
until after the 19th--

08:45.135 --> 08:46.869
only patients
and surgical procedures.

08:46.904 --> 08:49.272
So I guess lunch with your
wife is out of the question.

08:49.306 --> 08:50.339
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:50.374 --> 08:51.641
I wanted to be further along
by now,

08:51.675 --> 08:55.578
but the typesetter needs
the handout materials by Friday.

08:55.612 --> 08:57.747
Virginia left us
a little shorthanded.

08:57.781 --> 08:58.915
We'll be fine.

08:58.949 --> 09:01.417
I could help out for a while.

09:01.451 --> 09:04.020
At least answer the phones.

09:05.856 --> 09:10.393
Oh, I-I don't think
that's a good idea,

09:10.427 --> 09:13.029
considering your condition.

09:13.063 --> 09:15.264
There's nothing for me
to do at home except to wait

09:15.299 --> 09:19.235
for the stork... and for you.

09:19.269 --> 09:22.838
He hasn't been home one night
this week before midnight.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.510
I could be your new Virginia--

09:27.544 --> 09:31.013
your new old Virginia, the one
that just answered the phones.

09:32.816 --> 09:36.919
I never did <i>just</i>
<i>answer phones, did I, Bill?</i>

09:45.462 --> 09:47.063
Yes.

09:47.097 --> 09:50.266
All right.
That's, uh-- that's fine.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.867
Uh, just for a few days.

09:51.902 --> 09:55.638
Uh, you can help us
get over the hump.

09:55.672 --> 09:56.872
Now it finally makes sense,

09:56.907 --> 09:59.442
why Virginia didn't want to work
nights anymore.

09:59.476 --> 10:00.977
She and Ethan are an item.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.712
You neglected to tell me that.

10:02.746 --> 10:05.081
Did I?

10:05.115 --> 10:08.084
They were having
a send-off for him downstairs,

10:08.118 --> 10:09.785
and he told me the whole story.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.821
Too bad he's leaving, huh?

10:11.855 --> 10:13.656
It's his own doing.

10:13.690 --> 10:16.625
He's made
some very poor decisions.

10:16.660 --> 10:19.662
That have worked
to other people's benefit.

10:21.164 --> 10:23.566
Anyhow, he seems to be taking it
in stride.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.235
In fact, I don't think
I've ever seen him happier.

10:26.269 --> 10:28.604
A good woman
can make all the difference.

10:32.909 --> 10:35.778
Dr. William Masters' office.

10:53.997 --> 10:55.998
Can you take a break?

10:56.033 --> 10:58.467
What's that?

10:58.502 --> 11:01.103
10 minutes, Bill.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.806
Please.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.576
Look at this.
Uh, and for you?

11:08.812 --> 11:10.746
I ate.

11:10.781 --> 11:13.015
About an hour ago,
in front of the TV.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.283
You don't remember?

11:14.317 --> 11:17.453
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry.

11:17.487 --> 11:19.155
Thank you.

11:19.189 --> 11:22.425
Can I ask?

11:24.861 --> 11:30.699
What's on the other side of
this, once you present the work?

11:30.734 --> 11:32.134
What will be different?

11:32.169 --> 11:35.738
Uh... everything.

11:36.873 --> 11:41.143
A university's stamp of approval
makes the work legitimate--

11:41.178 --> 11:44.080
you know, not some clandestine,
after-hours enterprise

11:44.114 --> 11:46.248
but something
that can operate in the open,

11:46.283 --> 11:48.684
which means more resources
for the study,

11:48.718 --> 11:53.355
a more diverse sampling,
further-reaching conclusions.

11:53.390 --> 11:56.592
And recognition, headlines...

11:56.626 --> 11:58.627
awards.

12:01.398 --> 12:02.998
Uh...

12:03.033 --> 12:04.667
maybe...

12:04.701 --> 12:06.168
further down the road.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.672
That's-- that's not
what I'm focused on.

12:09.706 --> 12:11.774
No?

12:11.808 --> 12:14.043
Does it end there?

12:17.380 --> 12:21.183
When do you stop feeling like
you've got something to prove?

12:24.387 --> 12:27.423
There's always
something to prove.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.674
Wait.
How do you like your eggs?

12:45.709 --> 12:49.512
Uh, I don't know.
Scrambled.

12:59.556 --> 13:03.726
Henry! Tessa!
It's time to wake up!

13:07.164 --> 13:08.864
We wanted cereal.

13:08.899 --> 13:11.767
Three more boxtops, and we
get a Siren Whistle Crazy Ring.

13:11.801 --> 13:14.737
Sometimes eggs are nice, too.

13:15.939 --> 13:18.374
- Ethan!
- Ethan!

13:21.378 --> 13:23.979
Dr. Housecall, at your service.

13:24.014 --> 13:26.282
And what's your ailment today,
ma'am?

13:26.316 --> 13:28.851
- My stomach hurts.
- Mine, too.

13:28.885 --> 13:32.988
Oh, well,
I prescribe 10... tickles!

13:33.023 --> 13:35.958
1, 2, 3...

13:35.992 --> 13:38.160
Scrambled eggs.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.828
Mmm. You read my mind.

13:39.863 --> 13:41.263
How about fried chicken?

13:41.298 --> 13:42.998
We're having it for dinner,
right, mom?

13:43.033 --> 13:44.833
Can Ethan come? Can he?

13:44.868 --> 13:46.769
He's welcome to join us.

13:46.803 --> 13:49.939
Lillian is going
to a medical conference

13:49.973 --> 13:52.074
outside of Knoxville
this afternoon.

13:52.108 --> 13:53.842
So I thought I'd duck out early.

13:53.877 --> 13:55.244
She didn't ask you to go with?

13:55.278 --> 13:58.948
Mm. She did, actually,
but, you know, the kids.

13:58.982 --> 14:01.083
Why didn't you say
anything earlier?

14:01.117 --> 14:02.885
You should go.
I can watch them.

14:02.919 --> 14:04.220
Yeah, mom.
Ethan can watch us.

14:04.254 --> 14:05.988
Ethan is our friend.

14:06.022 --> 14:07.189
He's not a babysitter.

14:07.224 --> 14:08.857
Well, we're not babies.

14:08.892 --> 14:11.961
Look, nothing bad could
happen to us 'cause he's a doctor.

14:11.995 --> 14:13.529
She makes an excellent point.

14:13.563 --> 14:15.464
It'd be fun, right?

14:15.498 --> 14:17.032
Please?

14:17.067 --> 14:19.768
Not too much fun, I hope.

14:19.803 --> 14:21.403
After all, it is a school night.

14:21.438 --> 14:23.305
It'd be
just the right amount of fun.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.075
Not too little, not too much.

14:26.109 --> 14:30.346
Gin, come on. Go.
I got you covered.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.715
In the next section
of the study,

14:32.749 --> 14:35.217
we directed our attention
to the possibility

14:35.252 --> 14:36.218
of an intestinal lesion...

14:36.253 --> 14:37.453
...ovarian cyst.

14:37.487 --> 14:40.456
Special consideration
must be paid to patients

14:40.490 --> 14:42.925
after menopause.

14:42.959 --> 14:47.296
However, Miss T's history
of tarry stools should have...

14:47.330 --> 14:50.399
Another example is the ORH...

14:50.433 --> 14:52.501
...diverticulitis is suspected,

14:52.535 --> 14:57.139
sigmoidoscopy and a barium-enema
X-ray should be performed.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.677
Are there any questions?

15:07.417 --> 15:10.486
Bill, a Lester just called.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.221
He said he needs to know
as soon as possible

15:12.255 --> 15:14.957
what information
you want transferred to slides.

15:14.991 --> 15:17.359
- What are you doing?
- It's not big enough.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.762
Or... loud enough.

15:19.796 --> 15:23.632
There's too much methodology
here, too many numbers.

15:23.667 --> 15:27.403
I've got to grab their attention
in the first two minutes...

15:27.437 --> 15:29.872
and then hold it for another 38.

15:29.906 --> 15:31.874
What makes you think you won't?

15:31.908 --> 15:34.443
Frank Ditmer just did
20 minutes on diverticulitis.

15:34.477 --> 15:37.646
By minute four, it was like
rats deserting a sinking ship.

15:37.681 --> 15:39.748
Well, there's diverticulitis

15:39.783 --> 15:41.917
and then
there's human sexuality.

15:41.951 --> 15:42.951
Vir--

15:42.986 --> 15:44.953
Jane!

15:44.988 --> 15:46.755
You yelled, sir?

15:46.790 --> 15:49.558
Yeah, there's some
additional statistical data

15:49.592 --> 15:52.061
Virginia and I gathered
that I want to include...

15:52.095 --> 15:53.595
More data, Bill?
But didn't you just say--

15:53.630 --> 15:56.365
- ...on penis size.
- Oh.

15:56.399 --> 15:58.467
We compiled
the averages a while ago--

15:58.501 --> 16:00.803
flaccid, erect--
and there was data that showed

16:00.837 --> 16:03.072
that smaller phalluses expand
more than larger ones.

16:03.106 --> 16:04.907
I'm gonna need those numbers,
too, Jane.

16:04.941 --> 16:06.408
If you've compiled them,

16:06.443 --> 16:08.010
why aren't they already
in the presentation?

16:08.044 --> 16:13.248
Well, we thought--
<i>I</i> thought--

16:13.283 --> 16:16.185
they'd be a distraction from
all the other findings of ours

16:16.219 --> 16:19.254
that required more than a
grade-school ruler to determine.

16:19.289 --> 16:23.525
I think we should use everything
we've got, even the film.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.595
Tell Lester I'm gonna need
a projector on the day.

16:26.629 --> 16:29.531
Wait. The... interior footage?

16:29.566 --> 16:31.667
The "Looking down a mine shaft"
footage?

16:31.701 --> 16:34.436
- I'm sorry. What?
- Are you sure the audience

16:34.471 --> 16:35.437
is ready
for what they'll be seeing?

16:35.472 --> 16:36.505
What will they be seeing?

16:36.539 --> 16:37.639
I'll walk them through it.

16:37.674 --> 16:39.742
But I want it all
in the presentation--

16:39.776 --> 16:41.310
everything but the kitchen sink.

16:41.344 --> 16:45.614
And I want you to identify
female participants

16:45.648 --> 16:48.250
who have had strong
orgasmic responses with Ulysses.

16:48.284 --> 16:49.618
You can help Jane with that.

16:49.652 --> 16:52.121
She can show you
how to read the print-outs.

16:52.155 --> 16:53.789
May I ask why?

16:53.823 --> 16:57.126
We're gonna ask them to
come in for two additional sessions,

16:57.160 --> 17:00.929
to perform artificial coition
with different-size phalluses.

17:01.798 --> 17:03.699
We're gonna see
if penis size plays a role

17:03.733 --> 17:06.135
in women's sexual satisfaction.

17:06.169 --> 17:08.503
That should keep them
in their seats.

17:12.742 --> 17:16.678
Okay, "stair" like step
and "stare" like gaze.

17:16.713 --> 17:18.579
Good. Two more.

17:18.615 --> 17:20.883
All right, use--
like "use" a napkin

17:20.916 --> 17:23.218
and "youse," like...

17:23.252 --> 17:26.155
"Youse better trade me
that fucking baseball card."

17:26.189 --> 17:27.756
Who uses that word?

17:27.790 --> 17:30.859
Henry's friend Darryl
uses it all the time.

17:30.894 --> 17:34.029
Liar. He does not.

17:34.063 --> 17:36.832
Well, maybe he said it
once or twice.

17:36.866 --> 17:40.536
Hey, that is not a nice word
for anyone to use, especially a kid.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.137
There are lots
of better words--

17:44.441 --> 17:48.043
Like "darn."
Huh? Darn's a fine word.

17:48.077 --> 17:51.180
And also a homonym,
like, to darn a sock?

17:51.214 --> 17:52.981
Huh? Write that one down.

17:56.186 --> 17:57.619
May I help you?

17:57.654 --> 17:59.555
Who the fuck are you?

17:59.589 --> 18:02.324
Funny.
She's never mentioned your name.

18:02.358 --> 18:04.693
It's funny. She mentions
your name all the time,

18:04.727 --> 18:06.395
usually with an expletive
in front of it.

18:06.429 --> 18:08.297
Which, you could argue,

18:08.331 --> 18:10.966
is better than
never having been spoken of.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.703
Nevertheless, she left me
with very explicit instructions

18:14.737 --> 18:16.438
not to let the kids
out of my sight.

18:16.473 --> 18:19.508
Not even if they're
with their own father?

18:19.542 --> 18:22.611
If she was expecting you to
show up, she would have told me.

18:22.645 --> 18:24.446
I mean,
don't you two have a schedule?

18:24.481 --> 18:25.914
No, we keep it loose.

18:25.949 --> 18:27.483
I never know
when I'm gonna be in town.

18:27.517 --> 18:29.785
Well, I have a three-page
list that pretty much allows

18:29.819 --> 18:31.153
for every conceivable
possibility

18:31.187 --> 18:33.055
<i>except</i> you showing up.

18:33.089 --> 18:35.891
What qualifies you
to play guardian?

18:35.925 --> 18:38.126
Why should I
trust them with you?

18:38.161 --> 18:40.095
Well, for starters,
I'm a doctor.

18:40.129 --> 18:42.931
What kind of doctor is
free in the middle of the day?

18:42.966 --> 18:44.867
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.

18:44.901 --> 18:46.235
Oh. In other words,
you're unemployed?

18:46.269 --> 18:47.636
- Just for the time being.
- Yeah.

18:47.670 --> 18:49.037
You got nothing on me, pal.

18:49.072 --> 18:53.275
Hey! I missed you guys!
Who wants to watch TV?

18:53.309 --> 18:54.610
Ah, come on!

18:54.644 --> 18:56.879
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!

18:56.913 --> 18:57.913
Daddy!

19:02.712 --> 19:05.648
I'm preparing for a presentation
on a medical procedure

19:05.682 --> 19:07.349
which might just save
your wife's-- hey!

19:07.384 --> 19:09.552
Lillian, please take a break.

19:09.586 --> 19:11.887
Look out the window.
Enjoy the scenery.

19:11.922 --> 19:14.790
There's nothing to see.
It's pitch black.

19:14.824 --> 19:17.359
Would either of you
ladies like a ham sandwich?

19:17.394 --> 19:21.130
- I'm not really hungry.
- Thank you, no.

19:21.164 --> 19:24.033
But you're very kind
for the offer. Thank you.

19:24.067 --> 19:25.534
Are you heading home or away?

19:25.569 --> 19:28.304
I'm going to my sister's
wedding in Kingsport.

19:28.338 --> 19:29.672
Oh, how nice.

19:29.706 --> 19:30.940
Not really.

19:30.974 --> 19:32.408
Rydell, the groom--

19:32.442 --> 19:34.610
we think he held up
a service station.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.879
We're not entirely sure.

19:36.913 --> 19:38.314
But we think.

19:38.348 --> 19:39.682
I'm doing the hair.

19:39.716 --> 19:41.016
Oh.

19:41.051 --> 19:44.019
- Are you two sisters?
- No.

19:44.054 --> 19:46.255
No.
We are traveling for business.

19:46.289 --> 19:47.723
What kind of business?

19:47.757 --> 19:50.693
My companion is
a doctor, and I'm her assistant.

19:50.727 --> 19:53.495
No kidding?

19:53.530 --> 19:56.365
Do you know
anything about moles?

20:07.043 --> 20:11.113
Um, I'm looking
at your calendar, sir.

20:12.716 --> 20:16.085
How many subjects do you think
we can schedule in a night?

20:16.119 --> 20:18.220
Uh, three, maybe four.

20:18.254 --> 20:19.421
And you need each of them

20:19.456 --> 20:21.824
to come back
for a second session, right?

20:21.858 --> 20:23.525
To test with a different size?

20:23.560 --> 20:25.728
Which means we can only see
1/4 of the participants

20:25.762 --> 20:26.929
we'd otherwise see.

20:26.963 --> 20:28.964
Just... take care of it.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.299
Um...

20:30.333 --> 20:32.501
between now
and the presentation, sir?

20:32.535 --> 20:35.037
Will there be time
to see enough subjects?

20:35.071 --> 20:37.406
How many participants
do we have the time to see

20:37.440 --> 20:38.907
between now and the presentation?

20:38.942 --> 20:41.710
Maybe 12.

20:41.745 --> 20:44.013
You can't offer
a conclusive finding

20:44.047 --> 20:46.582
with a sample of 12, Bill.

20:46.616 --> 20:47.916
You know that.

20:47.951 --> 20:49.852
It's not big enough.

20:53.223 --> 20:57.860
Uh...
that'll be more than adequate.

20:57.894 --> 21:00.162
Really, sir?

21:00.196 --> 21:04.566
Here's another one--
"Married, three children, 28.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.635
Two sessions
of artificial coitus.

21:06.670 --> 21:09.705
Both times, she had a consistent
orgasmic response with Ulysses."

21:09.739 --> 21:10.906
Excellent.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.841
Do we tell them
the purpose of the study?

21:12.876 --> 21:15.110
You don't need
to tell them anything.

21:15.145 --> 21:16.912
Dr. Masters makes the calls.

21:16.946 --> 21:19.381
I'm the only one
who knows the identities.

21:19.416 --> 21:20.683
Well, you and Virginia.

21:22.085 --> 21:23.852
Uh...

21:23.887 --> 21:26.588
maybe it's not too late
to call this one.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.524
Will you excuse me, please?
Sorry.

21:29.426 --> 21:31.193
Confidentiality.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.699
I feel like
I'm always a step behind.

21:36.733 --> 21:39.468
It's a steep learning
curve, but it flattens out.

21:39.502 --> 21:41.503
Virginia taught me that.

21:41.538 --> 21:44.406
Probably won't be here
long enough to get my bearing.

21:44.441 --> 21:46.375
But that's okay.

21:46.409 --> 21:48.477
I just wanted to see Bill
in his element

21:48.511 --> 21:51.814
before I'm lost forever
to diapers and pacifiers.

21:53.183 --> 21:56.485
I do understand why he finds
the work so fascinating.

21:56.519 --> 21:59.755
All these study subjects--
how do you keep yourself

21:59.789 --> 22:02.458
from reading every single one
of their files?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.060
She lost her virginity at 16

22:05.095 --> 22:07.096
in the bathroom
of the Staten Island ferry

22:07.130 --> 22:09.798
to a sailor on liberty.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.835
Two sessions with Ulysses.

22:17.507 --> 22:21.210
First intercourse--
oh, my goodness-- 43.

22:21.244 --> 22:22.845
No?

22:22.879 --> 22:26.315
But-- -- multi-orgasmic.

22:26.349 --> 22:29.084
Talk about
patience being rewarded.

22:29.119 --> 22:32.087
There was
this one woman I saw--

22:32.122 --> 22:33.922
it's the thickest file.

22:33.957 --> 22:35.791
It's in here somewhere.

22:35.825 --> 22:37.426
Oh, here it is.

22:37.460 --> 22:40.496
She came in 23 times.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.297
That's the record so far.

22:42.332 --> 22:45.134
She participated 23 times?

22:45.168 --> 22:48.570
S-she's got to be eligible for
the size study, don't you think?

22:48.638 --> 22:49.805
Uh...

22:49.839 --> 22:51.373
"No artificial coitus.

22:51.407 --> 22:54.977
One session of automanipulation.
But nothing with Ulysses."

22:55.011 --> 22:56.578
So essentially
it was all intercourse...

22:56.613 --> 22:58.814
with...

23:01.317 --> 23:03.585
Well, this is weird.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.954
Same male study subject.

23:08.525 --> 23:11.593
Now, I'm sure she's got a story.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.936
Are you gonna eat your potatoes?

23:24.140 --> 23:29.044
How did Indians shave
if they didn't have razors?

23:29.078 --> 23:31.780
Uh, they, um...

23:31.815 --> 23:34.283
they used
sharpened buffalo teeth.

23:35.351 --> 23:38.320
And they looked
at their reflections in, um...

23:38.354 --> 23:40.322
- pools of water.
- They did not.

23:40.356 --> 23:43.725
Indians have very sparse
facial hair, like the Chinese.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.127
Just like Henry.

23:45.161 --> 23:48.263
Henry's gonna have plenty
of facial hair when he grows up.

23:48.298 --> 23:51.600
Mm-hmm.
Just like his father.

23:51.634 --> 23:55.504
You're more of a, uh,
peach-fuzz type, huh, pal?

23:55.538 --> 23:59.107
What are you sporting there--
three, four days' growth?

23:59.142 --> 24:00.843
I shaved this morning.

24:00.877 --> 24:03.512
You don't say.
So did I.

24:03.546 --> 24:06.715
Even when you shave,
daddy, you've got scratchy spots.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.785
Well, Bug, you know,
it's hard to stay on top of it

24:09.819 --> 24:11.987
when you have
a beard as heavy as I do.

24:12.021 --> 24:15.624
Really precise shaving takes
a kind of hand-eye coordination

24:15.658 --> 24:17.326
that lots of men
just don't have.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.294
I mean, surgeons do.

24:19.329 --> 24:22.231
Professional athletes,
baseball players, especially.

24:22.265 --> 24:24.399
Listen,
when the time comes, Sport,

24:24.434 --> 24:26.902
your old man's gonna teach you
how to shave.

24:26.936 --> 24:29.037
See, the trick of it
is going against the grain.

24:29.072 --> 24:30.339
<i>With</i> the grain.

24:30.373 --> 24:32.908
Against the grain causes
in-grown hairs and razor burn.

24:32.942 --> 24:34.443
Yeah, maybe in sissies,

24:34.477 --> 24:36.445
but if you want a close shave,
it's the only way to go.

24:36.479 --> 24:38.881
'Cause that approach has
worked so well for you in life--

24:38.915 --> 24:40.749
- going against the grain.
- Better than kowtowing

24:40.783 --> 24:42.885
to the establishment,
like some people.

24:42.919 --> 24:44.987
People with jobs,
who support their families?

24:45.021 --> 24:47.456
I don't see you having
either of those things, buddy.

24:47.490 --> 24:51.193
Hey, would you two stop?
We're watching here.

24:51.227 --> 24:54.730
I can ride a horse like that.

24:54.764 --> 24:57.532
I can ride bareback.

25:07.243 --> 25:09.611
Bill?

25:09.646 --> 25:12.314
You asleep?

25:12.348 --> 25:14.616
Nearly.

25:16.953 --> 25:19.254
I was just wondering.

25:19.289 --> 25:23.325
There was a couple in the study
who came back again and again.

25:23.359 --> 25:25.827
Do you know the ones I mean?

25:27.463 --> 25:30.198
Yes, a married couple.

25:30.233 --> 25:33.268
No, they weren't married.

25:33.303 --> 25:36.538
Her questionnaire said
she was divorced.

25:36.572 --> 25:39.041
Did it?

25:39.075 --> 25:41.877
Oh, yes, that's right.
I remember now.

25:43.613 --> 25:46.548
Libby, it's late.
Go to sleep.

25:48.284 --> 25:52.387
Did they know each other
before the study?

25:52.422 --> 25:54.222
Bill?

25:54.257 --> 25:57.826
I-I don't think so.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.095
So you introduced them.

26:01.664 --> 26:04.166
I suppose.

26:07.770 --> 26:10.605
23 times.

26:12.842 --> 26:15.544
They must have fallen in love.

26:17.780 --> 26:20.115
Did they fall in love?

26:25.188 --> 26:27.556
I-I don't know.

26:29.759 --> 26:33.929
That question lay
outside our area of inquiry.

26:52.648 --> 26:55.183
Remind me again
why the train was a bad idea.

26:55.218 --> 26:56.818
Trains break down, too,
you know.

26:56.853 --> 27:00.188
Didn't the desk clerk say
there were two beds?

27:00.223 --> 27:01.957
He also said there was a view.

27:01.991 --> 27:04.026
Well, ladies,
I'm just fine with the floor

27:04.060 --> 27:06.395
so long as I can pinch
one of those pillows.

27:06.429 --> 27:09.197
The driver said they can't get another
bus here till around 8:00 in the morning,

27:09.232 --> 27:12.034
and we've got another six hours
of driving, easy.

27:12.068 --> 27:14.069
The program ends at at 3:00.
You have the last spot.

27:14.103 --> 27:16.271
We'll be cutting it very tight.

27:16.305 --> 27:18.240
Oh, what's this contraption?

27:18.274 --> 27:22.744
"10 cents for 15 minutes of
tingling relaxation and ease."

27:26.616 --> 27:29.584
Can't seem to get away
from vibrators, now, can I?

27:33.189 --> 27:37.726
Hey, Doctor, why don't you let
me do your hair up in rollers?

27:37.760 --> 27:39.761
You'll look like a million bucks
in the morning.

27:39.796 --> 27:41.696
I can give you
the buck seventy-five special.

27:41.731 --> 27:44.900
How can you afford to
make a living charging so little?

27:44.934 --> 27:46.234
Doesn't your salon take 50%?

27:46.269 --> 27:48.303
How would you know that?

27:48.337 --> 27:49.871
Because
I used to worked as a singer.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.241
In another life.

27:53.276 --> 27:56.478
And no matter what I made,
the house always took half.

27:56.512 --> 27:58.447
Not me.
I keep all of it.

27:58.481 --> 28:01.316
I bring in a lot of heads, so I
worked out a deal with my boss.

28:01.350 --> 28:04.419
Ah.
The rainmaker's prerogative.

28:04.454 --> 28:07.556
That's what my old boss calls
that kind of arrangement.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.424
- Masters does?
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.459 --> 28:11.693
He brings in so many patients
to the hospital,

28:11.727 --> 28:14.463
the university allows him
to collect directly

28:14.497 --> 28:15.597
for his services.

28:15.631 --> 28:17.032
I don't understand.

28:17.066 --> 28:20.335
He's not paid a salary,
like all the other doctors?

28:20.369 --> 28:24.072
No, he's more, um...
like an independent contractor.

28:24.107 --> 28:28.076
So the more patients
he gets, the more he benefits.

28:28.111 --> 28:31.680
It's not like he's making
off in the night with the money.

28:31.714 --> 28:33.448
He's diverting funds, Virginia.

28:33.483 --> 28:35.784
He's not doing anything
the university hasn't sanctioned.

28:35.818 --> 28:37.085
That doesn't make it right.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.254
Don't you see how that
disadvantages every other doctor

28:39.288 --> 28:40.822
trying to get a study
off the ground?

28:40.857 --> 28:43.558
I have to go begging
for a pittance,

28:43.593 --> 28:46.461
but meanwhile, Bill Masters
gets to skim off the top?

28:46.496 --> 28:49.531
It's a sweetheart deal,
Virginia, and it's not fair.

28:51.667 --> 28:54.769
Ahhh.

28:57.406 --> 29:00.375
I'm afraid there's
nothing till after the 19th.

29:00.409 --> 29:04.212
No, not a trip. He's got
a very big presentation.

29:04.247 --> 29:08.850
Thank you, Dr. Jarvis.
I'll tell him that.

29:08.885 --> 29:11.720
You know,
you have a smile in your voice.

29:11.754 --> 29:13.722
I do?

29:13.756 --> 29:15.390
It's an excellent
quality in a secretary.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.859
It really puts people at ease.

29:17.894 --> 29:19.294
Well, aren't you sweet?

29:21.731 --> 29:24.466
Can I get you anything
while you wait?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.701
Oh, Bill, this is--

29:26.736 --> 29:28.837
Dr. Masters--
Malcolm Toll.

29:28.871 --> 29:30.405
I'm one of the new fellows.

29:30.439 --> 29:33.341
I did my residency at Ann Arbor.

29:33.376 --> 29:35.544
Duncan McAllister
said to say hello.

29:35.578 --> 29:38.280
I just want to say
how much I'm looking forward

29:38.314 --> 29:41.016
- to learning from you, sir.
- Yes. Well...

29:41.050 --> 29:42.551
I just reached
a fourth participant.

29:42.585 --> 29:44.219
I've scheduled her for 9:15.

29:44.253 --> 29:46.321
Uh, sir, I saw you have

29:46.355 --> 29:48.790
a uterine adenocarcinoma surgery
scheduled for tomorrow.

29:48.824 --> 29:50.091
I was hoping I could observe.

29:50.126 --> 29:51.760
Dr. Toll was just telling us

29:51.794 --> 29:53.995
he's a fourth-generation
physician.

29:54.030 --> 29:55.797
Have you cleared it
with your attending?

29:55.831 --> 29:57.399
I thought
I'd get your okay first.

29:57.433 --> 30:00.835
Dr. Masters, I know you have
a history of mentoring fellows,

30:00.870 --> 30:04.406
and I just want to make a case
for myself as early as possible.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.742
I-I know Dr. Haas had that role

30:07.777 --> 30:09.511
and he's no longer
at the hospital.

30:09.545 --> 30:12.080
And I know his
are very big shoes to fill.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.583
They're not so big, actually.

30:14.617 --> 30:17.118
Well,
I just wanted to let you know,

30:17.153 --> 30:18.920
I'm a man with very big feet.

30:21.657 --> 30:25.227
He didn't mean that
literally, Jane.

30:25.261 --> 30:29.197
But he actually does.

30:29.232 --> 30:31.166
May I ask?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.468
Size 13 1/2.

30:33.502 --> 30:35.370
Since I was 11.

30:44.247 --> 30:47.482
We're too late. We missed it.

30:51.254 --> 30:52.587
Lillian?

30:52.622 --> 30:54.723
I have to sit down.

31:02.231 --> 31:03.498
Are you all right?

31:03.532 --> 31:04.799
Of course I'm not all right.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.569
I just traveled 17 hours
for no reason at all.

31:07.603 --> 31:11.873
Well,
let's just regroup for a moment.

31:11.907 --> 31:14.609
You know
why we missed it, Virginia?

31:14.644 --> 31:16.978
Because we were stuck
in a fleabag motel.

31:17.013 --> 31:19.447
Why were we stuck?
Because we took the bus.

31:19.482 --> 31:21.883
Why'd we take the bus? Because
we couldn't afford the train.

31:21.917 --> 31:24.719
And we couldn't afford the train
because Washington University

31:24.754 --> 31:30.158
only gave me a lousy 600 bucks
to fund an outreach program.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.961
Why did they only give me $600?

31:32.995 --> 31:37.465
Because every penny Bill Masters
is making for the university,

31:37.500 --> 31:39.434
he's giving to himself.

31:40.836 --> 31:42.170
Is that what you think?

31:42.204 --> 31:45.774
That all of this
leads back to Bill?

31:45.808 --> 31:48.209
Well, it starts
with him and what he represents.

31:48.244 --> 31:49.744
Which is what, exactly?

31:49.779 --> 31:52.981
You think Bill's advantaged
because he's a man?

31:53.015 --> 31:55.617
He's advantaged
because he's a brilliant doctor

31:55.651 --> 31:57.752
who figured out a way
to beat the system

31:57.787 --> 32:00.355
and not so he could line
his own pockets, mind you,

32:00.389 --> 32:01.690
but so he could fund research

32:01.724 --> 32:04.492
that he believes
will help better people's lives.

32:04.527 --> 32:07.062
Well,
having a dick doesn't hurt.

32:09.298 --> 32:11.199
You know
what you've got, Lillian?

32:11.233 --> 32:12.534
You've got a case of penis envy.

32:12.568 --> 32:15.003
It'd make things a lot easier.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.906
Don't you ever wish
you were a man?

32:17.940 --> 32:19.741
No.

32:19.775 --> 32:21.376
Never.

32:23.379 --> 32:25.680
You never feel betrayed
by your anatomy,

32:25.715 --> 32:27.048
that you have all these parts

32:27.083 --> 32:28.750
that could just turn
against you?

32:34.657 --> 32:37.792
I don't know what I'm saying.

32:37.827 --> 32:41.830
Suddenly,
I'm just very, very tired.

32:43.733 --> 32:46.368
Well, you don't get to be tired.

32:46.402 --> 32:48.136
We're here.

32:48.170 --> 32:49.637
It took us 17 hours,
but we're here.

32:49.672 --> 32:51.206
So we need to figure out a way

32:51.240 --> 32:53.174
to make this trip worthwhile
somehow.

32:53.209 --> 32:54.676
What do you suggest?

32:56.312 --> 32:58.813
Well...

32:58.848 --> 33:01.950
there aren't just fraternities
in this world.

33:01.984 --> 33:04.352
There are also sororities.

33:07.089 --> 33:09.157
Excuse me, sir?

33:09.191 --> 33:11.393
The doctors,
they're all out golfing?

33:11.427 --> 33:14.529
Yes, ma'am.
You looking for your husbands?

33:14.563 --> 33:18.299
Uh, no. Actually,
we're looking for their wives.

33:28.778 --> 33:30.211
Excuse me, ladies.

33:30.246 --> 33:32.046
Might I trouble one of you
for a cigarette?

33:32.081 --> 33:33.648
I've just smoked my last.

33:33.682 --> 33:35.083
Oh, of course.

33:35.117 --> 33:36.985
Thank you.

33:37.019 --> 33:38.787
Would you care to join us?

33:38.821 --> 33:40.321
Oh.

33:40.356 --> 33:42.824
Yes, thank you.

33:42.858 --> 33:45.627
I'm Virginia.
This is Lillian.

33:45.661 --> 33:47.896
Hello. I'm Enid.

33:47.930 --> 33:53.134
And this is
Geraldine, Betsy, Diana, and...

33:53.169 --> 33:55.770
and I am so sorry.
I've forgotten your name.

33:55.805 --> 33:57.272
- Louise.
- Louise.

33:57.306 --> 33:58.773
We've only just met.

33:58.808 --> 34:00.308
Oh, I see.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.343
And yet I'm sure
you have so much in common.

34:02.378 --> 34:05.246
Kids, men who love to golf.

34:06.549 --> 34:08.882
In fact, I bet even
how you first met your husbands.

34:08.918 --> 34:11.186
How many of yours
were office romances?

34:11.219 --> 34:14.688
Well, I ran Doug's office
for two years.

34:14.723 --> 34:17.391
I was Mel's nurse.

34:17.426 --> 34:18.693
Greg's secretary.

34:18.726 --> 34:21.429
Well,
I'm sure all of their practices

34:21.464 --> 34:23.898
were better off having you
on the payroll,

34:23.933 --> 34:25.366
whispering in their ears,

34:25.400 --> 34:27.402
letting them know
that maybe their patients had

34:27.436 --> 34:30.938
other concerns besides, say,
losing the baby weight.

34:30.973 --> 34:32.907
Am I right?

34:32.942 --> 34:35.476
Doug used to say,
"Let's check the oil,"

34:35.511 --> 34:37.411
before he did a pelvic exam.

34:37.446 --> 34:39.914
I put a stop to that.

34:39.949 --> 34:42.283
You know,
there's this new cancer test

34:42.318 --> 34:45.453
that they're doing in all of the
major metropolitan hospitals.

34:45.487 --> 34:49.224
It's a simple cervical swab--
takes less than 10 seconds.

34:49.257 --> 34:51.226
Lillian here is far better
versed in the medicine

34:51.260 --> 34:52.226
than I am.

34:52.261 --> 34:54.862
What were you telling me
earlier?

34:54.897 --> 34:56.797
It's called the pap smear.

34:56.831 --> 34:59.100
Maybe some of you ladies
have heard of it.

35:02.371 --> 35:04.172
You missed them.

35:04.206 --> 35:06.341
They tried to stay up, but they
couldn't keep their eyes open.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.842
I tucked them in
about 20 minutes ago.

35:07.877 --> 35:10.879
It's not even 8:00.

35:10.913 --> 35:14.048
They're kids.
They were tired.

35:15.885 --> 35:18.086
Well, did you give Tessa
her stuffed turtle?

35:18.120 --> 35:19.988
Because she can't sleep
without that thing.

35:20.022 --> 35:22.557
It's a Raggedy Ann doll now.

35:25.027 --> 35:27.896
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

35:27.930 --> 35:30.932
I don't enjoy them waiting
for a father who doesn't show up.

35:30.966 --> 35:32.700
Hey, I don't need
a lecture from you, pal.

35:32.735 --> 35:34.235
And just because
you're popping my ex-wife,

35:34.270 --> 35:36.037
that doesn't give you
any right to--

35:36.071 --> 35:37.572
I'm going to marry her.

35:40.576 --> 35:41.843
I haven't asked her yet,

35:41.877 --> 35:45.547
but I'm going to,
and she's going to say yes.

35:49.785 --> 35:53.288
Well, I wouldn't count on it.

35:54.823 --> 35:58.593
Gini's not like other girls.

35:58.627 --> 36:01.462
She doesn't put much stock
in a ring on her finger.

36:01.497 --> 36:05.867
She'd probably be happy
to go on like this for a while.

36:05.901 --> 36:09.137
Well, she'd be foolish
to follow me out of state

36:09.171 --> 36:10.972
unless it was as my wife.

36:11.006 --> 36:12.607
I'm considering
a number of job possibili--

36:12.641 --> 36:13.975
You're not taking
my children out of Missouri.

36:14.009 --> 36:15.610
You're welcome to visit.
You visit now.

36:15.644 --> 36:17.178
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

36:17.212 --> 36:20.048
I'm just saying,
I'm going to be there for them.

36:20.082 --> 36:21.983
You don't have to like it.

36:22.017 --> 36:25.186
Well,
let me tell you something, pal.

36:25.220 --> 36:28.623
It doesn't matter what you and
Virginia do or where you go,

36:28.657 --> 36:31.659
'cause you are <i>never</i> gonna be
those kids' father.

36:31.694 --> 36:33.328
You want to keep
the title, George?

36:33.362 --> 36:35.229
You got it.

36:35.264 --> 36:37.932
All I want is the job.

36:55.117 --> 36:57.785
So...

36:57.820 --> 37:02.490
you're free to choose
whichever phallus you like.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.025
In a future session,

37:04.059 --> 37:06.427
you'll be asked to use the one
you didn't choose tonight,

37:06.462 --> 37:10.498
and we'll be comparing
those results with your response

37:10.532 --> 37:13.234
to the very first phallus
we provided you with.

37:13.268 --> 37:15.336
What are you doing, Bill?

37:17.072 --> 37:21.509
There's not enough time
to get it right.

37:21.543 --> 37:25.513
Which one
would you like to begin with?

37:28.317 --> 37:31.386
I feel like Goldilocks.

37:33.822 --> 37:37.091
You're waiting to see
which one I choose, aren't you?

37:37.126 --> 37:40.228
Wondering if it reflects
a particular preference.

37:40.262 --> 37:42.864
I'm just here to observe.

37:42.898 --> 37:44.065
Impartially?

37:44.099 --> 37:47.068
No stake in the outcome,
whatsoever?

37:49.738 --> 37:51.572
I know
what the outcome is gonna be.

37:51.607 --> 37:52.974
How?

37:53.008 --> 37:57.045
12 study subjects can't prove
anything conclusively.

37:57.079 --> 38:02.116
In time,
if additional data warrants it,

38:02.151 --> 38:03.785
I'll revisit the finding.

38:03.819 --> 38:04.952
Which is what?

38:06.922 --> 38:08.289
A man's size doesn't matter.

38:08.323 --> 38:09.924
There's no way
you could know that.

38:09.958 --> 38:11.059
I'm going to say it.

38:11.093 --> 38:12.427
You are cutting corners, Bill.

38:12.461 --> 38:15.363
I'm gonna tell them
what they want to hear.

38:15.397 --> 38:17.765
So they'll hear
what I want to tell them.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.267
It's for the greater good.

38:19.301 --> 38:22.737
You've got to get people
into the tent, Virginia--

38:22.771 --> 38:26.607
make the work relevant to them,
personally.

38:26.642 --> 38:31.045
You're not giving them
the gift you think you are.

38:31.080 --> 38:35.083
Now, after all those jubilant
small-to medium-sized men

38:35.117 --> 38:38.319
come home and crawl into bed
beside their sleeping women,

38:38.353 --> 38:40.421
they're gonna stare up
at the bedroom ceiling

38:40.456 --> 38:41.723
and they're going to realize

38:41.757 --> 38:45.593
that if size doesn't matter,
something else does.

38:46.695 --> 38:50.198
And that something else is going
to scare the hell out of them

38:50.232 --> 38:54.736
because maybe...
they don't have it.

38:56.271 --> 38:59.407
And maybe Ethan does.

39:01.677 --> 39:03.878
That's the fear, isn't it?

39:03.912 --> 39:07.081
Not whether you're big enough.

39:07.116 --> 39:10.218
Whether you're good enough.

39:19.128 --> 39:21.963
I need this to go well...

39:23.599 --> 39:25.800
because if it doesn't...

39:29.471 --> 39:32.406
I will have lost everything.

39:37.846 --> 39:42.850
You are a bigger man
than that, aren't you?

39:45.587 --> 39:48.456
No.

39:48.490 --> 39:50.892
I don't think I am.

39:55.397 --> 39:58.266
Miss 8:30's all wired up.

40:00.869 --> 40:02.870
I'm ready.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.549
Hickory, Maryville, Spartanburg,

40:14.583 --> 40:17.785
Dalton, Albertville,
and Williamsburg.

40:17.820 --> 40:21.255
We've got advocates
in six cities, in six states,

40:21.290 --> 40:23.124
in one fell swoop.

40:23.158 --> 40:25.626
That is a good day's work.

40:27.129 --> 40:32.099
The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

40:32.134 --> 40:35.303
You should needlepoint
that on a sampler.

40:36.839 --> 40:40.875
Most of them met their husbands
at work.

40:40.909 --> 40:43.878
It makes you wonder, doesn't it?

40:46.148 --> 40:49.350
You could meet
someone, too, Lillian.

40:49.384 --> 40:50.885
No, I mean, where they'd be

40:50.919 --> 40:52.987
if they'd actually pursued
careers--

40:53.021 --> 40:56.257
all those women, putting their
ambitions on the back burner.

40:58.493 --> 41:01.195
I'm not looking for a man.

41:01.230 --> 41:04.999
And according to Bill Masters,
I don't need one.

41:05.033 --> 41:08.870
Didn't you say that was
a big revelation from his study?

41:08.904 --> 41:11.739
It's not
just <i>his</i> study, you know.

41:11.773 --> 41:13.975
Well...

41:14.009 --> 41:17.211
his will be the only name
on it.

41:20.115 --> 41:21.949
Don't you find it ironic that,

41:21.984 --> 41:24.218
in the end,
it's going to be a man

41:24.253 --> 41:27.555
who will tell women that they
can find their own satisfaction?

41:27.589 --> 41:32.026
Which isn't all that satisfying
for you, is it?

41:32.060 --> 41:36.063
Don't you ever want anything
that's just yours, Virginia?

41:39.468 --> 41:41.936
Well, who has anything
that's just theirs?

41:41.970 --> 41:44.338
What do you have?

41:47.576 --> 41:49.076
I have cancer.

41:50.946 --> 41:52.546
What?

41:52.581 --> 41:55.416
Cervical cancer, actually.

41:55.450 --> 41:58.486
It's very advanced.

41:58.520 --> 42:01.055
Past the point of treatment.

42:02.891 --> 42:07.094
It was detected with a pap smear
in my mid-20s.

42:07.129 --> 42:10.464
I wanted to be a doctor
before that,

42:10.499 --> 42:15.336
but it led me to specialize
in gynecology.

42:19.574 --> 42:21.943
And you've had...

42:21.977 --> 42:25.346
radiation?

42:25.380 --> 42:27.782
And then a hysterectomy.

42:27.816 --> 42:29.450
I thought it was gone,

42:29.484 --> 42:32.453
but then it came back
about 18 months ago.

42:32.487 --> 42:37.591
It progressed to my liver,
which is Stage IV.

42:40.395 --> 42:42.930
Lillian...

42:44.766 --> 42:48.569
I'm so sorry.

42:48.603 --> 42:52.773
I'm not going to be around
to see the testing become routine.

42:54.910 --> 42:59.480
I'm going to have to hand
the work off...

42:59.514 --> 43:03.851
to someone who can fight
the fight...

43:03.885 --> 43:07.488
who can talk small
but think big...

43:09.191 --> 43:12.593
who can find the shortest
distance between two points.

43:19.835 --> 43:22.770
Do you know anyone like that?

43:32.080 --> 43:33.848
Ah.

43:35.371 --> 43:35.709
... and they did.

43:40.179 --> 43:45.717
And the thing of it is,
I let them go.

43:45.751 --> 43:48.453
I mean, if you don't want
your kids to turn out like you,

43:48.487 --> 43:51.089
then what have you
got to teach them?

43:51.123 --> 43:53.224
Hmm.

43:55.794 --> 43:58.396
You seem like a nice enough guy.

44:00.165 --> 44:01.466
I'd like to think so.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.434
Trying to be.

44:03.469 --> 44:05.303
Yeah.

44:05.337 --> 44:08.172
Wherever you land, I could--
I could probably book

44:08.207 --> 44:12.176
some local gigs thereabouts,
change up circuits.

44:12.211 --> 44:13.678
That'd be nice.

44:16.215 --> 44:18.850
It doesn't mean
I don't love them.

44:18.884 --> 44:21.219
Of course not.

44:30.162 --> 44:33.965
I hope you'll wish
Virginia and me well.

44:33.999 --> 44:35.400
Well, I tell you,

44:35.434 --> 44:39.837
it helps knowing that what she
and I had, you'll never know.

44:39.872 --> 44:43.574
Because she's not the girl
she was back then.

44:43.609 --> 44:46.244
Well...

44:46.278 --> 44:48.012
I'll take her anyway.

44:48.047 --> 44:50.081
Ever heard her sing?

44:50.115 --> 44:53.184
Nah.
She doesn't even hum anymore.

44:53.218 --> 44:55.787
And the two of us onstage...

44:55.821 --> 44:58.356
I'm telling you,

44:58.390 --> 45:01.459
you know, we had this rhythm,
we had this...

45:01.493 --> 45:04.095
back and forth.

45:04.129 --> 45:06.864
We were a real team.

45:09.268 --> 45:11.302
But she changed.

45:11.336 --> 45:12.603
Got a career.

45:12.638 --> 45:15.606
Got all ambitious.

45:18.377 --> 45:21.879
You'll never know
the girl she was back then.

45:25.150 --> 45:28.853
And that's my consolation prize.

46:03.355 --> 46:05.790
Bill?

46:05.824 --> 46:07.658
What is it?

46:07.693 --> 46:09.427
Nothing.

46:09.461 --> 46:11.629
Can't sleep.

46:11.663 --> 46:14.298
Is it work?

46:14.333 --> 46:15.566
No.

46:15.601 --> 46:17.935
It's, uh... no.

46:17.970 --> 46:20.371
Well, can I get you something?

46:20.405 --> 46:23.040
No. I'm fine.
Please, don't get up, Libby.

46:24.376 --> 46:26.778
I should be taking care of you.

46:26.812 --> 46:30.414
You do.

46:30.449 --> 46:33.518
Uh, l-let's go back to bed.

46:37.122 --> 46:39.891
You do take care of me.

46:39.925 --> 46:42.894
You...

46:42.928 --> 46:46.130
feel good...

46:46.165 --> 46:47.965
inside me.

46:51.003 --> 46:53.104
You feel just right.

46:53.138 --> 46:54.705
- Libby, please--
- No, I-I...

46:54.740 --> 46:58.509
I know that I wasn't your first.

46:58.544 --> 47:02.046
But you were mine.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.249
And once I met you,

47:05.284 --> 47:09.253
I've never wanted to be
with another man.

47:15.794 --> 47:19.063
I am so sorry about George.

47:19.097 --> 47:21.065
- I had no idea--
- It's okay.

47:21.099 --> 47:24.135
No bones were broken.

47:24.169 --> 47:26.470
He and I got a lot
straightened out, actually.

47:26.505 --> 47:29.473
Really? Like what?

47:29.508 --> 47:32.710
Actually, never mind.
I don't want to know.

47:32.744 --> 47:36.013
I do want to know, but...
only if it's good.

47:36.048 --> 47:41.452
If it's bad, I'd prefer if you
waited until I was less tired.

47:42.754 --> 47:45.223
It was a hard trip.

47:49.728 --> 47:53.064
If I die, he gets the kids.

47:54.433 --> 47:57.101
- What?
- He's their father.

47:57.135 --> 47:59.904
It'd be hard to make a case that
they belong with anybody else.

47:59.938 --> 48:03.474
I... I can't die.

48:03.508 --> 48:06.010
Just...

48:06.044 --> 48:08.112
promise me I won't die.

48:10.916 --> 48:14.385
Well, I'm a doctor.

48:14.419 --> 48:18.189
So you've got that
working in your favor.

48:18.223 --> 48:21.158
Have you heard
from any hospitals?

48:22.961 --> 48:26.097
A few.

48:26.231 --> 48:29.400
Any close by?

48:29.434 --> 48:32.003
I don't know how many miles
I can put on the car

48:32.037 --> 48:34.739
driving back and forth
before I'm gonna need new tires.

48:34.773 --> 48:37.141
Well, why don't you
let me worry about that?

48:39.478 --> 48:42.446
In fact, why don't you
let me worry about everything?

48:45.450 --> 48:47.284
I mean it, Gini.

48:47.319 --> 48:50.855
You want to quit your job,
go to school full-time?

48:50.889 --> 48:52.590
I think you should.

48:52.624 --> 48:54.291
You want to stay home
with the kids?

48:54.326 --> 48:56.093
I'll support you, in every way.

48:56.128 --> 48:57.762
Wow.

48:57.796 --> 49:00.131
What has gotten into you?

49:00.165 --> 49:03.534
You must have really missed me.

49:03.568 --> 49:08.339
If there is something
that you always wanted to do,

49:08.373 --> 49:12.877
someone you wanted to be
and you never got the chance,

49:12.911 --> 49:16.280
I will make that happen.

49:16.314 --> 49:18.783
I want us to be a team.

49:18.817 --> 49:20.618
Aren't we?

49:20.652 --> 49:21.786
We're a couple.

49:21.820 --> 49:23.721
No, a team.

49:23.755 --> 49:25.756
Like-- I don't know--
like Burns and Allen.

49:25.791 --> 49:27.224
Or Lewis and Clark.

49:27.259 --> 49:28.492
Bonnie and Clyde.

49:28.527 --> 49:30.961
Hey.

49:30.996 --> 49:33.230
I'm serious.

49:33.265 --> 49:36.700
Haas and Johnson.

49:36.735 --> 49:40.204
It's got a ring to it.

49:40.238 --> 49:41.539
Don't you think?

49:58.623 --> 50:02.359
# you give your hand to me #

50:02.394 --> 50:06.097
# and then you say hello #

50:06.131 --> 50:10.000
# and I can hardly speak #

50:10.035 --> 50:13.771
# my heart is beating so #

50:13.805 --> 50:17.575
# and anyone can tell #

50:17.609 --> 50:21.779
# you think you know me well #

50:21.813 --> 50:24.715
# but you don't know me #

50:28.687 --> 50:32.456
# no, you don't know the one #

50:32.491 --> 50:36.393
# who dreams of you at night #

50:36.428 --> 50:40.231
# and longs to kiss your lips #

50:40.265 --> 50:43.968
# and longs to hold you tight #

50:44.002 --> 50:47.571
# to you, I'm just a friend #

50:47.606 --> 50:51.642
# that's all I've ever been #

50:51.676 --> 50:55.813
# no, you don't know me #

50:59.151 --> 51:02.553
# you give your hand to me #

51:02.587 --> 51:06.123
# and then you say goodbye #

51:06.158 --> 51:10.361
# I watch you walk away #

51:10.395 --> 51:13.931
# beside the lucky guy #

51:13.965 --> 51:18.102
# you'll never, never know #

51:18.136 --> 51:22.039
# the one who loves you so #

51:22.073 --> 51:28.746
# no, you don't know me #

51:29.305 --> 51:35.332
