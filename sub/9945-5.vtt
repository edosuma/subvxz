00:22.280 --> 00:25.431

00:25.520 --> 00:27.909
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.993
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:32.080 --> 00:37.837
to calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.469

Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:57.480 --> 00:59.835
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.754

to sort out Liam's trip tomorrow.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.349
Are you coming or not? There needs
to be a parent present and I don't want...

03:33.440 --> 03:37.319

If he wins, they do the shoot
there and then.

the last to know?!

04:20.120 --> 04:23.590
Well, look what child stardom did
to the Artful Dodger from Oliver.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.478
You know, and then there's
poor Nicholas Lyndhurst.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.675
Well, he's not dead.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.751
Yeah, but have you seen
the fuckin' state of him?

04:29.840 --> 04:31.034

you look like death warmed up.

they're all the same. So use a condom.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.919

- Aw...

11:44.280 --> 11:46.430
First thing you do,
go grovel to the Super.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.556
Second, find Stan and apologise.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.278
He'll be fine. You know Stan,

11:50.360 --> 11:53.716
he's probably watching us now,

12:51.960 --> 12:53.234

12:53.320 --> 12:55.231
I hope so.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.949

you were trying for a baby.

12:59.040 --> 12:59.995
We weren't.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.595
Course you weren't.
No Maguire man tries for a baby.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.116
I only had to hang my kecks on the bedpost
and your mother was up the spout.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.792
You'll all be the same.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.313
Well...

13:14.360 --> 13:16.590
Have you been to the toilet?

13:16.680 --> 13:18.272
- Mm-hm.
- Good lad!

13:18.360 --> 13:21.989
- I'm all dressed up, you know?
- No, come on. Where you going? Out!

13:22.080 --> 13:24.719
- What do you mean, "Where you going?"
- No, not that way! Out!

13:26.320 --> 13:27.753
Bloody hell!

13:30.160 --> 13:32.674
We'll go via the A roads.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.079
That'll take forever.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.118
No, it'll be nice
driving round the countryside.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.589
We've got three hours
to get to Blackpool,

13:39.680 --> 13:42.513
we're taking a longer route -
for what, aesthetics?

13:44.200 --> 13:46.111
(Frank) Am I being ignored here?

13:47.720 --> 13:50.837
I'll take that as a yes.

14:42.640 --> 14:46.349
Don't wanna be eating any of that
hospital food, end up in a fuckin' coma.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.034
Thanks, Mam.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.190
How is she?

14:51.280 --> 14:53.953
The doctor said she should be
discharged this morning.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.076
- And she's OK?
- Yeah, she will be.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.438

15:03.040 --> 15:05.429
You lose a child,
your life's never the same.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.196
We'll wait for her,
bring her home together.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.670
Show her we care,
that the whole family's behind her.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.512
She doesn't like much fuss, Mum.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.910
Or says she doesn't.
But at a time like this...

15:22.120 --> 15:24.236
I tell you what might be
a better idea, Mam.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.470
How's about we go back
and get pub ready, eh?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.312
Your mother says we wait, we wait.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.994
Yeah, but Karen's not gonna
wanna come back to...

15:31.080 --> 15:35.073
Well, you know?
No-one's cleaned up yet, have they?

15:35.160 --> 15:38.118
You're right.
We've got things to do.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.668
We'll make sure the flat's
spick and span.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.354
There won't be a pin out of place.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.912
God, you're still glowing like
you've had a fortnight in Chernobyl.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.230
Do you think we should flick it
with some Holy Water?

16:06.320 --> 16:09.471
You know, in case he's still there?
Give him a bit of a send-off?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.279
There's not gonna be much
of that here, is there?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.954
Could get some soda water or summat,
I'll give it a blessing.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.755
Ugh!

16:21.840 --> 16:23.193
Aargh!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.229
You two all right?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.753
Fine, thanks.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.757
We got you one with a...

16:30.840 --> 16:36.551
mattress protector on it,
so if you have any mishaps in future

16:36.640 --> 16:39.552
you just give it a quick wipe, sorted.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.710
Sorry, mate.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.789
I...

16:44.280 --> 16:46.589
I know what it is
you're going through, mate.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.954
You reckon?

16:48.040 --> 16:50.998
Kelly had that phantom pregnancy,
remember?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.398
Felt like I'd been robbed.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.710
Beaten senseless

16:56.800 --> 16:58.995
and robbed.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.071
And no-one knows that pain, mate.

17:01.160 --> 17:05.039
Unless you've been there, that is.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.269
You should've said.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.998
Not like you could've
done owt, is it?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.396
We could go out for a drink
sometime, couldn't we?

17:14.480 --> 17:15.753
Head into town, maybe?

17:15.839 --> 17:17.432
Yeah.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.714
Yeah, that'd be good.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.354
What's with the fucking flowers?

18:00.960 --> 18:03.349
I know this couldn't
have come at a worse time.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.759
The lad you left in charge
last night... Joe?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.513
We checked the safe. It's empty.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.478
God knows how much you took
over the bar last night.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.870
I've not seen people knocking 'em back
like that in a long while.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.392
- Straight to voicemail.
- Tried ringing Mandy.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.799
She's not answering.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.792
Wait till I get my hands on her.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.349
- You stupid, stupid bastard!
- I'm sorry.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.352
I didn't mean for this to happen,
it was a joke!

18:41.440 --> 18:42.190
A joke?!

18:42.280 --> 18:45.352
Led Stan to believe you'd been
murdered just to get one up on him?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.112
I'm as disgusted as you are.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.079
I tried his mobile earlier,
he isn't picking up.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.276
Well, he might answer
when he sees it's me.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.112
MOBILE RINGS

18:55.200 --> 18:56.713
Stan?

18:59.160 --> 19:01.355
It's OK, it's OK!

19:01.440 --> 19:03.908
I'm not dead! Stan, it was a joke!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.433
It was a wind-up!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.556
Where've you been?
We've all been worried sick.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.554
I think you'd better go.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.835
Call me.
When he starts talking.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.832
Stan? Mate, I'm sorry!

19:32.320 --> 19:35.756
- Well played!
- You two keep your mouths shut

19:35.840 --> 19:39.150
and there'll be plenty more
where that came from.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.158
- Round one to us, I think!
- Thank you!

19:54.840 --> 19:56.956
Norma, we've got less than
two hours to get there!

19:57.040 --> 20:00.032
- You think I don't know that?!
- Well, call the breakdown services.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.475
My membership ran out a month ago.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.757
Well, look, let's pool our resources
and see how much we've got, eh?

20:05.840 --> 20:06.795
We won't have enough.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.474
And even if we had the cash,
time's totally against us.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.272
- Great(!)
- Debbie!

20:12.360 --> 20:13.759
I'm sorry!

20:16.120 --> 20:19.192
Just imagine.
Liam's whole life could've changed,

20:19.280 --> 20:22.716
just like that. Happens, doesn't it?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.119
I said I'm sorry.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.872
His chance to escape.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.598
That place.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.398
Those people...

20:29.480 --> 20:31.755
We are those people.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.275
Oh.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.878
It was a joke!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.397
There's plenty of time for kids.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.948
You're both young, healthy.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.598
Plenty of time.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.955
Mam, I'm all right, honest.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.794
BLEEPING

21:48.160 --> 21:49.639
Ah, yes!

21:49.720 --> 21:52.075
Hey, no smoking! Can't you read?

21:52.160 --> 21:55.391
Yeah, that's why I don't
work in a fuckin' café.

21:57.640 --> 22:01.679
(Frank) So what now, Einstein? We'll need
a fucking miracle to get there on time.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.916
HEAVENLY CHOIR SINGS

22:23.400 --> 22:26.597
MUFFLED ARGUING

22:46.480 --> 22:48.436
ENGINE STARTS

22:48.520 --> 22:50.590
Norma!
Norma, it's started!

22:50.680 --> 22:52.477
Come on!

22:59.360 --> 23:03.114
Loaves into fishes!
Water into wine! Blind men can see!

23:03.200 --> 23:05.839
- Wait!
- City win the league!

23:05.920 --> 23:08.878
- Hurry up!
- For fuck's sake!

23:18.440 --> 23:20.112
Oh, I'm shagged out!

23:21.920 --> 23:25.276
Hey, Blackpool
here we fucking come, mate!

23:42.080 --> 23:45.629
The wailing wall's gone, thank fuck.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.551
I said your mam's gone.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.712
We need crisps - cheese 'n' onion -
and cashews.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.559
Jamie, cheese 'n' onion and cashews.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.868
I'll get down the cellar.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.234
We're out.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.390
Cash 'n' carry, then.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.471
No time.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.869
Nip round to Yvonne's
and see if she can sub us.

24:10.520 --> 24:14.752
You are all right
about all this, aren't ya?

24:14.840 --> 24:16.273
Yeah, fine.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.150
Wasn't like it was planned.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.038
If it had've been, I'd be gutted.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.554
We got things to do, places to see.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.471
It's gonna be a lot easier
doing that round-the-world trip

24:31.560 --> 24:33.357
without a nappy bag and a buggy, eh?

24:35.520 --> 24:40.036
I know I've never really talked
about it, but, well, kids...

24:40.120 --> 24:41.758
Cards on the table, Jamie,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.599
I've never really wanted any.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.636
You?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.153
No.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.273
Crisps, yeah?

25:09.280 --> 25:11.191
Thought I'd get this back to you

25:11.280 --> 25:13.236
before you sent
the sniffer dogs out.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.915
Got your messages. And the other eleven
from my mother.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.355
- Nice to be trusted.
- Sorry, things've been...

25:19.440 --> 25:21.908
No matter how they are,
I'd never rob my own brother.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.513
I'm just glad
to see the back of it.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.716
I haven't slept all night.
The till roll's in there.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.995
Nice one, Joe.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.274
I'm sorry, Sis.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.793
Forgiven.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.394
Best phone Mum and Dad,
let them know you've surfaced.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.511
If you're not doing anything, could do
with a hand getting this place ready.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.157
Sure.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.708
Cheers for last night, man,
you're a lifesaver.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.597
And I'm sorry too, mate.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.714
I don't really know
what to say, but...

25:47.800 --> 25:49.791
A kid would've just cramped me style.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.873
I said I'd give Jamie a hand.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.474
It'll have to wait.
We need to be somewhere.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.437
Where?

26:07.560 --> 26:09.755
Jamie and Karen
should be here by now.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.353
Mandy's been in touch.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.113
They're not up to it, God help them.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.395
Hit them hard. Knew it would.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.239
Mam, Dad.

26:19.320 --> 26:24.599
This is my girlfriend, Grace.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.955
Grace Jones.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.758
Jones? You Welsh, then?

26:30.360 --> 26:31.554
Sorry for your loss.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.471
Thanks. Would you like a drink?

26:33.560 --> 26:35.232
No. I'm all right, thanks.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.918
Seen the size of her feet?

26:43.640 --> 26:46.108
I thought you said
it were a miscarriage?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.792
Oh, that? It's... symbolic.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.110
Some bollocks more like.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.668
If you ask me,
you've had a lucky escape.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.273
I wouldn't be without mine,

26:54.360 --> 26:57.557
but parenthood isn't all it's cracked up
to be. Look at Angelina and Brad

26:57.640 --> 27:00.313
tripping about
with their brood in tow,

27:00.400 --> 27:04.075
make it look like a piece of piss.
All flip-flops and cheesecloth.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.674
- I'll get you a box back tomorrow.
- Guaranteed, when they're at home,

27:06.760 --> 27:09.035
straight off to the nanny's.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.918
Angie and Brad feet up,
couple of cans, watching telly.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.117
Can you imagine her changing
a shitty nappy? Can you?

27:15.200 --> 27:18.476
With those nails,
she'd rip their arse to shreds.

27:41.040 --> 27:46.034
He used to be so full of life.
Now, since Tom's...

27:46.120 --> 27:46.791
Prank.

27:46.880 --> 27:51.271
...prank... it's like there's a light
gone out in his eyes.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.112
He's not half the man he was.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.670
- Don't overdo the tears.
- So how much are we making on this?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.991
While Stan's on full wages,
L30 a week each.

28:00.080 --> 28:05.632
If he gets compensation, a 10% cut,
two-week family holiday a year,

28:05.720 --> 28:09.679
Florida, not open to negotiation,
and a Christmas bonus.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.671
Yeah, but we don't do Christmas.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.672
Stan does.
Anyway if it all goes tits up,

28:14.760 --> 28:18.639
it'll be six month
in Strangeways for fraud.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.512
Sorry.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.473
Nine.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.028
- What the fuck's that?
- Pressie for the nipper.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.031
Manchester United?!

28:39.760 --> 28:41.796
Fuck that.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.319
- Celtic?
- Name me one football team from Belfast.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.719
What?

29:08.960 --> 29:11.520
I know it's mental,
you know it's mental.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.910
Just go along with it
for my sake, yeah?

29:23.800 --> 29:28.032
Named him after the patron saint
of unborn children, Saint Gerard.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.999
- What, Stevie?
- Gerard Majella.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.150
Someone just told us in the pub.
I didn't believe it.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.516
- I don't know why I didn't believe it!
- I thought you'd told them?

29:42.600 --> 29:44.670
How could I tell them?

29:44.760 --> 29:46.034
You knew about this?

29:46.120 --> 29:47.872
I thought it'd be best
to get it out the way

29:47.960 --> 29:50.474
and hopefully you'd never find out...

29:50.560 --> 29:53.120
- You'd never know.
- Well, it's a bit late now, innit?

29:58.480 --> 30:01.438
Fuck... right... off.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.875
That's the grief talking.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.190
Have you been sniffing
your own produce?

30:06.280 --> 30:09.033
- You're upset, but watch your mouth.
- You gonna let her talk like that?

30:09.120 --> 30:11.554
Are you gonna cancel
this fuckin' carnival?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.039
A child died.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.997
It wasn't at the stage
to be a boy or a girl, Dad!

30:15.080 --> 30:17.913
It was a boy. A Maguire's
first born is always a boy!

30:18.000 --> 30:21.549
I was three weeks late
for my period. For God's sake!

30:23.160 --> 30:24.798
This is warped.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.792
Gerard had a soul
and we're saving it.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.678
I should be fucking furious...

30:31.760 --> 30:35.036
but d'you know what? I'm not.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.872
Because I had a lucky escape.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.351
Imagine giving birth to anything
with their blood in it.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.238
You'll thank us come Judgement Day!
No grandson of mine's

30:44.320 --> 30:45.912
knocking about in purgatory.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.879
I want him at God's side
before the Devil knows he's dead!

30:49.960 --> 30:53.032
I was gonna ask them, did they
want to put anything in the coffin?

30:53.120 --> 30:55.873
Did you put my pressie
and letter in?

31:13.560 --> 31:15.516
I'm sorry, I can't...

31:15.600 --> 31:16.749
But I thought you liked me?

31:16.840 --> 31:20.276
I did. I do. But this?

31:20.360 --> 31:22.999
I never thought I'd say this,
but all this?

31:23.080 --> 31:24.593
It's just too fucking weird.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.475
(Paddy) Micky!

31:38.440 --> 31:39.793
(Norma) I love the seaside.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.269
There's something quintessentially
British about it, don't you think?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.555
(Liam) What's quintessential mean?

31:44.640 --> 31:46.153
Look at that.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.310
(Norma) No, I love it here.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.029
(Monica) It's got a certain charm,
but I prefer Lesbos.

31:58.520 --> 32:01.717
We're delighted you allowed
Liam to attend, truly delighted.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.951
- So, er, what are his chances?
- Good. Very good.

32:05.040 --> 32:09.397
In fact, he's the last of the boys
to be seen today

32:09.480 --> 32:11.835
and, to be honest,
I think the best, facially.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.480
- So is it you who decides?
- It's a joint decision.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.709
When will you make it?

32:15.800 --> 32:18.837
Well, we'll take a few test shots,
see how he looks, about half an hour?

32:18.920 --> 32:20.797
Oh, so he could win it?

32:20.880 --> 32:24.111
It depends on how he reacts
in front of the camera, the pressure.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.872
A lot of boys don't like
that much attention.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.757
Oh, he loves it,

32:27.840 --> 32:29.876
loves being the centre of attention,
doesn't he, Frank?

32:29.960 --> 32:31.393
Yeah, a born performer.

32:31.480 --> 32:36.110
And a fantastic face.
Tells its own story, don't you think?

32:36.200 --> 32:38.236
All right, Carl?

32:38.320 --> 32:40.276
70p, love.

32:40.360 --> 32:41.998
Sorry...

32:42.080 --> 32:44.514
You can keep the change.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.238
Five...

32:46.320 --> 32:48.436
- What?
- Er, nothing.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.033
Cheeky bastards, the lot of them.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.509
- They're my family.
- That's worse.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.036
I don't want 'em in here, Jamie.
I don't want 'em anywhere near me.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.633
Can't bar them, Karen.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.233
I can and I fucking will.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.959
Wait until you've calmed down
before you do anything.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.679
You know, one thing
guaranteed to make my blood boil -

33:08.760 --> 33:12.070
is being told to twatting calm down!

33:16.160 --> 33:18.310
How many out of ten
did you give Karen?

33:18.400 --> 33:19.674
Nine.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.399
Fiery. She'd be a right goer.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.913
What did I get?

33:26.320 --> 33:27.878
I'm not in there?

33:39.360 --> 33:40.349
Eight out of ten.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.914
Five. But let's see if we can
improve on that, shall we?

33:53.880 --> 33:54.915
Who the?!

33:55.000 --> 33:59.312
Oh, since the girls on the estate
heard what you were doing...

33:59.400 --> 34:02.995
Six? Shane's got fuckin' seven!

34:03.080 --> 34:04.513
Me dad's got fuckin' five!

34:04.600 --> 34:05.999
Whoa, we're losing altitude.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.513
Six?!

34:17.520 --> 34:19.987
Liam, I want us to go for
a real sad look now, please.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.797
Look at the camera.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.393
- Like Norma.
- Shut up!

34:23.480 --> 34:25.710
Always witty, Frank. Always witty.

34:26.800 --> 34:31.998
So, um, if Liam's chosen,
he'll be the face of what exactly?

34:32.080 --> 34:35.868
A national campaign
aimed at highlighting the misery

34:35.960 --> 34:37.837
of a small but significant
section of society.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.592
Who?

34:39.679 --> 34:41.033
Those without voices.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.235
- Westlife?
- The invisible.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.551
Could you be a little more specific?

34:46.639 --> 34:48.870
If Liam is chosen,

34:48.960 --> 34:52.714
he'll be giving hope to thousands,
maybe even millions.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.360
The numbers of those suffering
are almost impossible to calculate.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.953
Suffering what, exactly?

34:57.040 --> 35:01.158
Abuse. He'll be portraying
an abused child.

35:01.240 --> 35:05.870
So when you look at my son, Liam,
that is how you see him?

35:05.960 --> 35:07.188
Not at all. I see...

35:07.280 --> 35:09.475
A fantastic face -
telling it's own story!

35:09.560 --> 35:11.516
Monica! Monica!

35:11.600 --> 35:13.238
I think there's been
a misunderstanding...

35:13.320 --> 35:17.029
And what a story! Knocked about,
beaten by his unloving parents, neglected,

35:17.120 --> 35:21.591
without a voice, without hope.
Does he look unhappy? Malnourished?

35:21.680 --> 35:22.829
Knocked about? Does he?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.239
You're blowing this
out of all proportion.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.676
You want a face for
a national campaign about abuse?

35:27.760 --> 35:31.753
If you don't get out my fucking way,
you'll have one!

35:31.840 --> 35:34.229
Projecting abuse!

35:34.320 --> 35:36.197
He's never been smacked in his life!

35:36.280 --> 35:38.589
People don't take that much notice
of faces, Mon,

35:38.680 --> 35:40.511
it's the message that sinks in,

35:40.600 --> 35:44.991
and if Liam's face can help
that message get through, who knows?

35:45.080 --> 35:47.958
It could help to save
some poor kiddy's life.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.792
Not only that, they said
they'd up his fee to a grand.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.791
What, he's got the job?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.757
They've sent all the other lads home.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.638
He's just what they're looking for,
apparently.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.156
Oh, come on, let's just get
this thing done and get home, eh?

36:04.720 --> 36:07.280
MOUTHS

36:09.840 --> 36:11.034
Cash!

36:11.120 --> 36:12.473
That's not possible.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.516
Liam, in the van!

36:14.600 --> 36:16.955
Where are we going to raise money
with such short notice?

36:17.040 --> 36:22.239
Ha! You've got cash cards,
credit cards, expense accounts.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.151
Cash.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.959
- (Frank) Come on, Liam.
- Come on.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.269
The doctor said,
as far as Stan's concerned,

36:31.360 --> 36:34.113
he's locked in the moment
of discovering you hanging.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.315
So what's the next move?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.356
If I can get him to stop crying
for long enough,

36:37.440 --> 36:40.671
I might be able to start
talking him round, but until then...

36:40.760 --> 36:44.514
Tell him I'm really sorry, Yvonne.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.158
I went too far.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.231
I will. When he's lucid.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.314
He could lose his job!

36:59.400 --> 37:03.678
That's his fault! You could've
had a piggin' heart attack.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.751
I like having you around.
Brew?

37:05.840 --> 37:08.593
My turn. You put your feet up.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.039
OK, and again, please, Liam.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.749
Right, this time, I want you
to imagine your dad's a drunk,

37:18.840 --> 37:20.910
an old junkie, OK?

37:21.000 --> 37:24.788
Your mum's run off with someone
and you haven't seen her for years,

37:24.880 --> 37:27.792
it's just you and your sister
all alone at home.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.359
- He's just not getting it.
- Liam, think of something really sad.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.159
Like something terrible's happened.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.118
And a little less panto?
Any advice?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.873
He's a happy soul. He takes after me.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.996
But if we don't get a shot
we can use...

37:55.160 --> 37:57.469
OK, looking this way please, Liam.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.630
That's it, it's brilliant!

38:02.240 --> 38:04.037
What did you say?

38:04.120 --> 38:06.076
It worked, didn't it?

38:08.680 --> 38:11.513
Sorry about before.
You know what me mam's like.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.555
You OK?

38:14.160 --> 38:15.639
I'm fine.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.153
I will be.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.957
It's just... kids. I dunno.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.031
There's no law says
you have to have 'em.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.678
That's just it.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.433
I don't...

38:29.520 --> 38:30.794
I don't know.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.632
Just not with Jamie.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.591
When I look at him,

38:36.680 --> 38:40.275
he doesn't say "Dad" to me.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.033
I shouldn't be telling you this.
You're his sister.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.078
He's a bloke. I'm your mate.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.988
I just don't know
what I want any more.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.079
I just don't know.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.277
(Director) Well done, Liam.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.999
Even more, if you can find
a little bit more...

39:06.080 --> 39:08.753
- Look, can't you just?
- Frank, we're OK here.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.990
No, can you just finish up?
The lad's upset.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.550
- Nearly there. Just let us get this shot.
- No, no, I said leave it!

39:17.320 --> 39:20.153
I said, he's had enough!
Right? Fuck off!

39:23.240 --> 39:25.037
He-he-he!

39:25.120 --> 39:27.475
Great team we make, eh, son?

39:27.560 --> 39:30.677
Dad did his bit
and got paid into the bargain.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.992
Pull over, pull over. I'll just nip in
and get a bit of steak.

40:32.760 --> 40:37.390
- I don't really fancy cooking.
- I'll cook and you can wash up.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.313
I fancy that even less. No.
Why don't we go for a meal?

40:40.400 --> 40:43.039
No, I thought it'd be nice to have
the family round the table.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.111
I know you think we should
put the cash aside

40:45.200 --> 40:47.350
in case he wants to go
to Oxford or Cambridge

40:47.440 --> 40:49.476
but 50 quid isn't gonna
put paid to that.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.630
- That wasn't the deal.
- Wasn't aware there was a deal.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.517
We decided, if he gets the job,

40:53.600 --> 40:55.352
he gets the money
and spends it on what he wants.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.237
How come I wasn't party to that?

40:57.320 --> 40:58.958
Cos you weren't there... again!

40:59.040 --> 41:00.632
Well, where was I?

41:00.720 --> 41:02.358
Pub, getting your nails done,

41:02.440 --> 41:04.908
getting your hair done,
getting your bits waxed?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.479
- You're not his mother, Debbie.
- And you are?

41:06.560 --> 41:09.074
Oh, stop it, there's no need.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.552
Well, come on! >

41:16.640 --> 41:19.393
Pizza?

41:19.480 --> 41:21.596
You could get that Wii box
you've had your eye on.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.229
That PlayStation, that Xbox,
you can get all three if you like.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.277
Well, don't wait up.

41:38.880 --> 41:43.158
<i>(Frank) Carpe dieml Seize the day.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.516
