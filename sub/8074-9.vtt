[theme music]

00:05.773 --> 00:08.176
[doorbell ringing]

00:08.209 --> 00:09.177
BEVERLY: Jackie!

00:09.210 --> 00:10.644
Guess who's come to visit.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.213
My god, it's Mom!

00:12.246 --> 00:14.782
Fred, hide, hide,
keep your voice down.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.317
Your mother knows
about me, Jackie.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.985
You remember she
was at our wedding.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.020
That old woman is
not coming in here.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.222
I have told her before.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.324
If she wants to come over,
she has to call first.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.892
That way we have time to leave.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.730
I think you should
just let her in.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.832
Are you insane?

00:31.865 --> 00:34.502
There is a baby in here!

00:34.535 --> 00:36.404
[knocking]

00:36.437 --> 00:37.838
BEVERLY: Jackie, I
know you're in there!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.541
I can see your filthy
car in the driveway.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.811
Dammit, we have to start
parking down the street.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.246
Jackie, I know
you hate your mom,

00:45.279 --> 00:46.414
but I think you're
being selfish.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.648
I am not.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.651
I never said you
couldn't hate her too.

00:50.684 --> 00:51.552
[knocking]

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
BEVERLY: Jackie!

00:53.121 --> 00:55.089
Fred!

00:55.123 --> 00:57.091
Oh, I guess no one's home.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.561
I suppose I'll just wait out
in the cold until they show up.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.497
[shivers] I wish
I'd worn a sweater!

01:06.100 --> 01:08.769
Turn on the sprinkler.

01:08.802 --> 01:09.703
This is ridiculous.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.838
No, Fred, don't!

01:10.871 --> 01:11.739
Jackie, Jackie!

01:11.772 --> 01:12.573
Don't!

01:14.908 --> 01:16.810
Hi, Bev, come on in.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.912
So, you are home.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.048
Thank goodness I
wasn't Ed McMahon

01:21.081 --> 01:22.883
with a million dollar
check, or you two

01:22.916 --> 01:25.586
would have really
missed the boat.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.688
Sorry, Mom, we
were taking a nap.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.022
Well, whatever you
were doing, I could

01:29.056 --> 01:31.725
see you weren't busy cleaning.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.961
There's my little man!

01:33.994 --> 01:39.633
[laughs] Come to
grandma, pudgy face!

01:39.667 --> 01:42.603
See, she's
completely harmless.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.405
It is like radiation, Fred.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.874
It may take 20 years, but
that baby is gonna pay

01:46.907 --> 01:49.743
the price for this exposure.

01:49.777 --> 01:53.147
[theme music]

02:34.922 --> 02:37.291
[laughs]

02:43.331 --> 02:44.665
What are you doing?

02:44.698 --> 02:48.536
Oh, I got stuck making this
costume for DJ's school play.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.238
I don't know why they
can't just do "Oh!

02:50.271 --> 02:51.071
Calcutta."

02:54.041 --> 02:57.044
Well, Mom stopped by
the house again last night

02:57.077 --> 02:58.412
without calling first.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.181
I told you, a couple of
loose wires in the doorbell,

03:01.215 --> 03:02.115
and that'll fix her right up.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.488
Fred just lets her in
the house, on purpose.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.493
I don't want her
around the baby,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.862
but Fred is obsessed with
our kid having a grandmother

03:14.895 --> 03:15.963
around all the time.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.831
So what's wrong with his mom?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.132
Oh, dead.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.205
Wow, you know how men
are when they have babies.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.874
They get all sentimental
and everything.

03:26.907 --> 03:31.712
I remember when I had
Becky, Dad made me tell mom.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.013
You know what Fred needs?

03:33.046 --> 03:36.284
He needs to spend a
little more time with Mom.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.752
Hi, Mom.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.454
You know, last week
me and Fred were

03:40.488 --> 03:42.089
talking about great Uncle Saul.

03:42.122 --> 03:47.127
And I can't remember whether
he had shingles or phlebitis.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.096
Oh the gout!

03:49.129 --> 03:50.731
Oh, that's fascinating.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.000
And I think Fred would think
it was fascinating too.

03:53.033 --> 03:53.934
You should give him a call.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.202
He's home right now.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.103
OK, I've gotta go now.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.871
Bye, Mom.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.239
Oh, oh, oh!

03:59.273 --> 04:00.941
So, so nasty.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.678
DAN: Hey!

04:04.712 --> 04:07.615
Hey, Lancelot, I
finished your costume.

04:07.648 --> 04:11.352
And I even put shoulder pads in
it so you look nice and macho.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.054
I don't wanna be
in that dumb play!

04:14.087 --> 04:16.023
Fine, then you're gonna
wear it to soccer practice.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.794
What's wrong with him?

04:20.828 --> 04:22.730
Well, apparently he has
to kiss a girl in this play,

04:22.763 --> 04:24.432
and he's really upset about it.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.533
I know what he feels like.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.035
They made me kiss a
boy in a school play.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.870
Yeah, but nobody made
you sleep with him.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.407
I'll tell you what.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.275
They wouldn't have
had to ask me twice.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.945
By the time I was 13,
I'd kissed seven girls.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.281
Yeah, two he wasn't related to.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.984
Well, the teacher says
he either kisses this girl

04:44.017 --> 04:45.386
or he's out of the play.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.587
Well, that's not fair.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.222
He's just a little boy.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.591
I'm gonna go talk
to that teacher

04:50.624 --> 04:52.059
and tell her what she can kiss.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.005
Hey, kid, where's your teacher?

05:05.038 --> 05:08.108
I'll tell you for a buck.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.309
Well, I don't have a buck.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.746
How would you like a
quarter shoved up your nose?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.415
You're DJ's Mom, aren't you?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.218
Hi, I'm Mrs. Simms.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.620
Hi, I'm Mrs. Conner.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.521
Can we talk.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.489
Certainly, sit down.

05:24.324 --> 05:30.698
Well, you know, it's about
that play that DJ's in.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.200
And he didn't know that
he had to kiss somebody,

05:33.233 --> 05:35.135
and he's really
uncomfortable about it.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.105
- DJ knew about the kiss.
- He did?

05:38.138 --> 05:41.308
Yes, that's why he wanted
the part in the first place.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.511
Oh.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.846
Well, you know how kids change
their minds all the time.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.416
He-- just last week
he hated all of us,

05:48.449 --> 05:50.350
and he wanted to
run away from home.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.620
You know this week, he--

05:52.653 --> 05:54.054
I guess that's not
a good example.

05:58.559 --> 06:02.062
DJ said you didn't
want him to kiss Geena.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.097
I'll just put someone
else in the part.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.400
Well, why can't you
just cut the kiss out?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.736
I mean, if it didn't
hurt my wedding ceremony,

06:08.769 --> 06:12.105
it ain't gonna hurt your play.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.274
I'm not going to change
the entire play because

06:14.307 --> 06:16.777
of certain people's values.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.447
Wow.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.615
I guess if he's forced
to kiss somebody,

06:21.649 --> 06:24.117
then I don't want him to
be in the stupid play.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.119
Where should I put
my costume Mrs. Simms?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.655
Why don't you just put
it on the table, Geena?

06:32.460 --> 06:35.729
That wouldn't be
the Geena, would it?

06:35.763 --> 06:36.797
Well, you can't
tell them apart?

06:39.399 --> 06:42.536
Oh, you thought that that's
why DJ didn't want to--

06:42.570 --> 06:45.338
and then you thought I knew
and that I supported that.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.774
I see a lot of
this around here.

06:46.807 --> 06:47.908
It always starts
with the parents.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.890
Dan.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.592
We've got a problem.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.795
Nothing that six more
of these won't cure.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.063
You know that Geena
girl in the play

07:10.097 --> 07:12.466
that DJ doesn't want to kiss?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.734
She's black.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.935
Oh.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.904
Yeah, so we've got
to make him kiss her.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.439
Everybody will think
we're a bunch of racists.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.574
DJ, get down here!

07:20.608 --> 07:21.675
Well, slow down.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.511
We don't know that's
why he won't kiss her.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.012
I'm sure he's got
a very good reason.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.614
I don't care
what his reason is.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.115
Everybody will think
it's because she's black

07:28.148 --> 07:31.084
and then I will never be
able to buy sheets again.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.019
Sit down.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.654
I want to ask you
some questions.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.488
OK.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.958
Your dad and I were wondering
how come you don't want

07:37.991 --> 07:39.192
to kiss that girl in the play.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.296
I don't know.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.032
Well, is it because you're
just not ready to kiss girls

07:45.065 --> 07:45.933
yet?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.935
No.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.703
Is she mean to you?

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
No.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.439
Is she gross?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.607
Does she pick her
nose and eat it?

07:57.377 --> 07:58.612
Does she have bad breath?

07:58.646 --> 08:00.313
Does she have a mustache?

08:00.347 --> 08:03.316
Does she have a whole bunch
of extra arms or something?

08:03.350 --> 08:07.087
Son, no matter what
it is, you can tell us.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.088
Is it because she's black?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.793
It is, isn't it?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.361
Well, you'll be
mad if I say yes.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.262
No, we won't.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.532
Yes, we will.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.902
I didn't raise you to
be some little bigot.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.170
I just don't want to kiss her.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.071
Hey!

08:24.104 --> 08:25.773
Black people are just like us.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.040
They're every bit as good as us.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.408
And any people
who don't think so

08:28.441 --> 08:30.110
is just a bunch
of banjo-picking,

08:30.143 --> 08:33.113
cousin-dating,
barefoot embarrassments

08:33.146 --> 08:37.050
to respectable
white trash like us!

08:37.084 --> 08:38.619
Honey, you're overreacting.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.287
DJ, if you don't want
to kiss this girl,

08:40.320 --> 08:41.589
your mom and I
won't force you to.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.224
Hey, you're kissing that girl.
You're doing the play.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.559
And that's all there is to it.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.161
Well, Dad said I didn't
have to, and Dad outranks you.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.703
Are you new?

08:55.736 --> 09:00.608
I'm not doing anything
until Dad says I have to!

09:00.641 --> 09:02.475
Well, isn't that great, Dan?

09:02.509 --> 09:04.778
Let's just make it easy
for our kid to be a bigot.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.213
Why don't you calm down?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.548
The subject is closed.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.450
Kissing that girl is
not gonna hurt him,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.485
and that is exactly
what he's gonna do.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.454
I think you're being a
little too hard on the kid.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.522
He grew up in Lanford.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.024
It's only 5% black.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.593
And kissing's a
new thing for DJ.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.494
It's only natural he's
not as comfortable kissing

09:21.528 --> 09:23.130
a black girl as one of his own.

09:23.163 --> 09:23.997
I did not say that.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.603
Well at least now I
know where he gets it.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.271
I'm not a racist.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.806
Yeah, neither's your father.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.442
He always says he has no
problem with the coloreds.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.844
I'm not my father!

09:36.877 --> 09:38.311
If I knew you was
gonna be passing down

09:38.345 --> 09:40.213
your family's crap to
my kids, I would not

09:40.247 --> 09:41.815
be having another one with you.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.083
Well, DJ's got it easy.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.384
I'm supposed to
kiss you tonight.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.057
I hate white people.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.368
So Roseanne says I'm a bigot.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.836
Do you think I'm a bigot?

10:02.870 --> 10:05.973
If I say yes, you'll stop
doing the minstrel show.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.074
Knock it off, Marvin.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.776
I'm serious.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.679
I mean, she thinks that
DJ could be getting

10:11.712 --> 10:13.513
racist attitudes from me.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.049
Well, Dad, that's
a pretty gray area.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.351
Personally, I probably would
have felt the same way you did.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.654
Well, that makes
me feel better.

10:20.688 --> 10:24.124
You're not a bigot, are you?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.325
The kid's just scared.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.060
I don't think you
should force him.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.931
Hey, man, any of you guys
ever been with a black woman?

10:30.964 --> 10:35.769
Well, there was this one girl
in Atlantic City, one time.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.505
Look, just like that nurse used
to be on television, you know,

10:38.538 --> 10:39.773
that Julia?

10:39.807 --> 10:44.077
I mean this girl had legs
that went on forever.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.045
Hey, Chuck.

10:45.078 --> 10:45.946
Chuckie!

10:45.979 --> 10:47.948
Chuck, hey.

10:47.981 --> 10:55.222
Well, so go on, legs
that go on forever.

10:55.255 --> 11:01.594
She was a very lovely woman,
and we had a very nice time.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.530
You're a wild man, Marvin.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.935
[laughs] So, what's with the
extra poker game this week?

11:07.968 --> 11:10.603
Roseanne finally come to
her senses and leave ya?

11:10.637 --> 11:12.472
[laughs]

11:12.505 --> 11:14.908
Believe me, if Roseanne left
me, you'd be a lot prettier

11:14.942 --> 11:16.977
and the opening bid
would be two panties.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.646
[laughs]

11:19.679 --> 11:22.415
Well, actually,
Chuck, me and the guys

11:22.449 --> 11:23.616
were just talking
about something.

11:23.650 --> 11:27.387
Hey, I should probably get
your opinion about this.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.355
Oh, what?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.423
Well, DJ's in
this play at school,

11:30.457 --> 11:32.059
and he's supposed
to kiss this girl,

11:32.092 --> 11:34.828
and he doesn't want to
because she's black.

11:34.862 --> 11:39.032
And I didn't think he'd be
getting this stuff from me,

11:39.066 --> 11:40.834
but where else could
he be getting it from?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.936
He could be getting
that stuff from anywhere.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.072
I mean, has he been
talking to Marvin?

11:45.105 --> 11:47.440
Hey.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.176
No, I'm-- I'm serious, Chuck.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.678
I really want your
opinion on this.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.413
Well, my opinion is you
should hold your cards

11:53.446 --> 11:54.815
where Fred can't see 'em.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.788
No, I mean, you know, we
don't know he's prejudiced.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.989
I mean, the kid is young.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.125
He hasn't had much exposure
to other cultures--

12:05.158 --> 12:05.959
Other cultures?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.396
Why?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.499
Is the black girl from China?

12:12.532 --> 12:15.435
No, I just don't
think you should force

12:15.468 --> 12:18.138
a kid to kiss someone that's--

12:18.171 --> 12:21.441
I mean, you know, you
grow up in a certain--

12:21.474 --> 12:25.445
with other-- this
is a very gray area.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.181
Guys, help me out here.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.549
Personally, I
don't think there

12:29.582 --> 12:32.419
can be a gray area when it comes
to respecting human beings.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.431
Chuck, do you understand
what I'm saying here?

12:44.464 --> 12:49.602
Well, you're saying that it's
OK that DJ doesn't want to kiss

12:49.636 --> 12:51.504
this girl because she's black?
- No, I'm not--

12:51.538 --> 12:52.605
I'm not saying that at all.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.974
Oh, but that's what
you want me to say.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.309
No!

12:56.343 --> 12:59.579
I mean, unless you
really feel it.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.949
Man, why do you
care how I feel so

13:01.982 --> 13:04.051
much more than everyone else?

13:04.084 --> 13:04.885
Because I'm black?

13:07.855 --> 13:10.190
Well, yeah.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.193
So if I feel OK,
all black people feel

13:13.226 --> 13:15.328
OK, because we all the same?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.696
I would never say that.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.965
Of course not.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.633
Some of-- some of your
best friends are black.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.435
Yes, you're one
of my best friends.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.403
That's why you're here.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.305
OK, then why's Bob here?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.773
DJ's got to kiss
a dumb girl too?

13:26.806 --> 13:27.674
No offense, Bob.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.577
Hey!

13:30.610 --> 13:32.379
Hey-- hey, guys.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.646
This is supposed to be fun.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.186
Let's just play the damn game.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.087
Check.

13:40.120 --> 13:40.988
Spotlight.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.555
I'm in.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.556
Who wants open?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.457
Give me three.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.292
Two.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.103
Hey.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.470
How's the comic book?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.873
This one guy just tore
off the other guy's arm

13:59.907 --> 14:01.174
with his bare hand!

14:01.208 --> 14:03.810
Let me see that.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.644
Cool.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.851
Listen, Deej, you
know, sometimes parents

14:11.885 --> 14:15.388
do certain things or
they act a certain way,

14:15.422 --> 14:17.224
and they don't realize
it's wrong until they

14:17.257 --> 14:19.592
see their kids doing it.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.860
You understand?

14:20.894 --> 14:24.297
Is this about peeing
behind the garage?

14:24.331 --> 14:25.398
Now, but stop doing it.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.235
You're killing the tomatoes.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.104
Anyway, I think
somewhere along the way

14:31.138 --> 14:35.943
here I mighta give you the
wrong idea about black people.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.947
And your mom was right.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.048
I don't wanna kiss Geena!

14:41.081 --> 14:42.149
Hey, tough, you've doing it!

14:42.182 --> 14:43.183
I hate you!

14:43.216 --> 14:46.786
Well, fine, you
don't have to kiss me.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.388
She just looks real different.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.556
It's only skin.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.658
It's not just her skin.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.626
She talks with kind
of an accident,

14:53.660 --> 14:55.495
and your hair is
kind of different.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.729
And her lips are different.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.267
Yeah, and-- and you're
probably different heights,

15:00.300 --> 15:01.734
you know.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.071
And your hair is brown
and your-- and your friend

15:04.104 --> 15:06.006
Ralphie's hair is that red.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.175
My eyes are blue, and your
mom's eyes are whatever

15:08.208 --> 15:09.009
the hell color they are.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.214
What if it feels weird.

15:14.247 --> 15:20.087
Look, son, I can't
let you get out of this

15:20.120 --> 15:23.056
because that would be wrong.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.092
But I'm afraid of what
the other kids will say.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.226
Oh.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.394
Well, the other
kids, well, they're

15:27.427 --> 15:29.997
gonna be extremely jealous.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.833
Because you're a
Conner, and Conner men

15:33.866 --> 15:35.935
are known as some of the
world's best kissers.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.942
OK, I'll do it.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.277
Good.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.479
You know, DJ, you're gonna kiss
a lot of girls in your life,

15:46.513 --> 15:48.681
and they're all
gonna be different.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.985
Well, do you think I should
even kiss Lyla Mathews?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.453
What's different about her?

15:53.486 --> 15:54.821
Well, Ralph says
she uses her tongue.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.427
I'd go for it.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.802
Why don't we close
up early, you know,

16:09.836 --> 16:11.471
because it's only 15 minutes?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.772
Yeah, sure.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.041
What the hell.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.910
We opened 15 minutes late,
so it'll all balance out.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.681
You know, I am really
very proud of Dan,

16:21.714 --> 16:23.583
admitting that he was
kind of prejudice.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.818
It just goes to show you're
never too old to learn

16:25.852 --> 16:27.254
something new about yourself.
[phone ringing]

16:27.287 --> 16:28.888
Yeah, like just the
other day when I learned

16:28.921 --> 16:32.259
I was married to a cracker.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.660
Lunch Box.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.296
Hi, Fred.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.798
No, I think that's a good idea.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.999
Mhm.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.869
Mom loves to have company
when she has a pedicure.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.372
Well, you two have a good time.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.639
Yes, I love you too.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.540
OK.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.941
Bye.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.111
They file off a toe.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.713
Are Harold and Maude
still seeing each other?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.648
It's-- it's-- it's weird.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.018
Fred must see something
in Mom that we don't see.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.955
But maybe there is some
teeny tiny decent human part

17:02.989 --> 17:05.625
buried deep--

17:05.658 --> 17:08.528
very deep inside.

17:08.561 --> 17:12.665
Don't idealize
your mother, Jackie.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.601
Maybe she acts
different around him.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.404
I-- why else would he like her?

17:17.437 --> 17:18.538
I don't know.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.274
Maybe he sees her and
he thinks of something

17:21.308 --> 17:23.410
good from his
childhood, like maybe

17:23.443 --> 17:25.278
one time some
screeching old harpie

17:25.312 --> 17:27.447
saved his life or something.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.149
[knocking]

17:29.182 --> 17:32.185
Oh my god, another customer.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.487
How many people have to
eat here before a word

17:34.521 --> 17:35.688
gets out about the food?

17:40.293 --> 17:42.195
Hello?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.730
Hi.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.232
Well, hi, would you
let me in, please?

17:48.835 --> 17:51.171
Uh, we're closed.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.307
Yeah, well, it says here
you're open till 10:00.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.209
Yeah, but see, we
had a really busy day

17:56.243 --> 17:59.246
and we ran out of food.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.614
Huh.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.615
Whew.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.516
Whew.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.884
He's scary.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.486
Sounded like it.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.954
I did the right
thing, didn't I?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.422
You said he was scary.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.323
Yeah.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.024
[knocking]

18:13.460 --> 18:15.428
Hey, I think I should
tell you something.

18:15.462 --> 18:20.400
I'm Mr. Williams,
Geena's father.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.634
Oh.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.370
Oh, come on in.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.705
I'm Roseanne Conner.

18:25.738 --> 18:29.376
Why didn't you just say that
you were Geena's father?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.043
You need to know all
your customers' names

18:31.077 --> 18:34.447
before they come
into your restaurant?

18:34.481 --> 18:37.917
Hey, Mr. Williams, you think
that you know what happened,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.219
but that wasn't what happened.

18:39.252 --> 18:43.323
No, she didn't do that because
you are African American.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.924
She did that because
you're a man.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.194
Yeah, and I'm prejudiced
against all men, equally.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.998
That's That's real funny.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.635
Hey, we're women, you
know, and it's night.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.704
This is like a matter of safety.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.038
And in situations
like that, I just

18:59.071 --> 19:01.140
got to go with my gut instinct.

19:01.174 --> 19:04.577
Well, I guess your kid
inherited your instincts.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.712
What?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.281
There's no way that that
is anything like this.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.449
Fine.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.583
Mr. Williams, come on.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.652
I'm sure you didn't
come here to fight.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.554
Well, just forget
about it anyway.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.389
There's probably just
no way you're ever gonna

19:16.423 --> 19:18.325
see where I'm coming from.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.392
You know, that's funny.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.960
I was gonna say the
same thing to you.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.938
Well, I think he blew
that out of proportion.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.344
I mean, you invited him in.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.345
You tried to make it up to him.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.183
You know, if he was a white
guy with the exact same build

19:44.217 --> 19:45.752
in those exact same
clothes, you would

19:45.785 --> 19:46.786
have done the exact same thing.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.226
Yeah, well, I'm glad
one of us is sure.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.729
Well, now, don't beat yourself
up over it, Roseanne, you know.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.266
Anybody else would have
done just what you did.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.170
Well, isn't that great?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.819
You know, dear,
you really should

20:19.852 --> 20:22.121
get in the habit
of using a coaster,

20:22.154 --> 20:23.490
even with this furniture.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.261
Thank you, Mother.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.297
We have to watch
this nature crap?

20:30.330 --> 20:31.197
Oh!

20:31.230 --> 20:32.198
That's right.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.501
You never liked
educational programs.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.770
Good thing it didn't
affect your career.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.939
Hey, Jackie, you
should see this.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.509
In order to claim the
carcass entirely for itself,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.811
the vulture emits
these piercing cries

20:44.844 --> 20:48.748
sending all the other animals
running for their lives.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.417
No, thanks, I'm
familiar with the concept.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.054
I'm going to bed.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.756
Oh, that's a good idea.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.592
You've been looking
extremely tired lately.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.629
Perhaps some cucumbers
for your eyes.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.898
I assume you at least keep
vegetables in the house.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.301
Yes, Mother, I keep
them on the couch.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.275
Goodnight, dear!

21:16.309 --> 21:17.877
Coast is clear.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.778
Oh!

21:18.811 --> 21:22.214
Thank god.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.484
Pass me a brewski.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.586
Ugh, I didn't think I
could keep up that annoying

21:26.619 --> 21:27.654
voice another minute.

21:30.357 --> 21:34.494
Does anybody else
know the real you?

21:34.527 --> 21:36.463
Now, that wouldn't
be much fun, would it?

21:42.535 --> 21:43.636
[belches]

21:45.538 --> 21:48.508
