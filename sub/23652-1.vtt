00:07.398 --> 00:10.184
I understand how busy you are

00:10.227 --> 00:13.796
If that's really the only
time that you can meet.

00:13.839 --> 00:17.191
I'll see you then.

00:17.713 --> 00:18.279
Thank you.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.343
Please!

01:22.386 --> 01:23.735
Give me your purse!

01:23.779 --> 01:25.302
Give me the purse!

01:27.870 --> 01:28.305
No! No!

01:40.187 --> 01:42.537
That's what I will remember
most of you, Mama.

01:44.147 --> 01:49.457
Your sweet smile,
your generosity.

01:56.942 --> 02:03.688
I love you Mama and I will
hold you in my heart

02:03.732 --> 02:06.474
until that day that we
meet again, okay?

02:09.216 --> 02:10.869
I love you.

02:21.489 --> 02:22.794
The service was lovely.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.448
Thank you for everything,
Auntie Phyllis.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.930
Honey, I wouldn't have it
any other way.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.976
Your mother was my best friend.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.328
In fact, why don't I go
back to the house,

02:34.371 --> 02:37.157
I'll, um, start setting out
the food for the reception.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.160
Oh, um, actually
I... I've got that.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.162
I'll set everything up
and get it ready.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.164
All you have to do is show up.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.252
Seriously.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.387
Your mother would be so proud

02:50.431 --> 02:53.782
of how you're
handling everything.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.914
And remember I'm right across
the street, as always,

02:55.958 --> 02:57.612
if you need anything at all.

02:59.701 --> 03:00.919
I love you.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.270
I love you, Auntie.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.459
Looks like half the
church turned up.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.202
Mama did a lot of volunteering
when Dad passed.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.816
I still can't
believe she's gone.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.168
I don't understand who would
have done this.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.692
Come on, let's get you back
to your Mama's house.

03:37.434 --> 03:38.087
'Kay?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.698
And the police don't
know anything.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.570
It hasn't been that long yet.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.441
They should have something
they could tell me.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.482
Baby, that's a sad
looking cupcake.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.746
I'm just saying you should
keep studying medicine.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.382
I cannot carry all my burdens,

04:55.425 --> 04:58.341
but I know you can, and will.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.126
Guide me and help me
hold on strong,

05:03.390 --> 05:07.611
through the trials
and tribulations ahead.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.702
Amen.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.845
I miss you, Mama.

05:40.470 --> 05:45.127
One sugar-free double latte
and one sugar full muffin.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.737
Thanks.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.349
I really needed this.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.872
Looks like you've
made some progress.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.355
It feels like I'll never finish.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.575
You know it's been really
nice having you here

05:58.619 --> 06:00.882
these past few weeks.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.058
Are you sure that
you don't wanna stay?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.668
You could finish up
your residency here

06:04.712 --> 06:05.974
at St. Vic's
with me.

06:06.017 --> 06:06.975
We're short on doctors.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.324
I could be your nurse.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.805
I'm in the middle of my
program at John Hopkins,

06:10.848 --> 06:13.111
and you know how hard
that spot was to get.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.113
I know.

06:17.028 --> 06:17.942
Are you expecting company?

06:26.690 --> 06:27.517
Ms. Daniels?

06:27.561 --> 06:28.518
Yeah.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.780
Officer Hector Sanchez.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.478
You left me a message?

06:31.521 --> 06:32.957
Please, come in.

06:33.001 --> 06:33.828
Sure.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.963
Sonya, I'll just finish
wrapping everything up

06:39.007 --> 06:40.574
in the dining room.

06:40.617 --> 06:41.749
'Kay.

06:41.792 --> 06:42.967
Packing?

06:43.011 --> 06:44.534
Yeah I don't have a choice.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.449
I can't afford the mortgage.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.929
I really appreciate
you coming by.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.192
I was hoping you had
an update for me.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.455
Most of the time any
real leads pop up

06:52.499 --> 06:54.631
within the first 48 hours
of a crime.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.112
It's been a few weeks now
and we really honestly

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
just don't have anything
solid to go on.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.289
What about the security cameras?

07:00.332 --> 07:01.899
There must be
something on there.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.859
Yeah no the perp was wearing
a hoodie and he was too

07:04.902 --> 07:07.731
far away from the camera
for any kind of an ID.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.341
What about witnesses?

07:09.385 --> 07:10.604
Yeah I'm sorry nobody
remembers seeing your mother.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.344
It was late,
most of the building

07:12.388 --> 07:13.824
had gone home for the day.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.391
It doesn't make any sense.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.872
What would she be doing at
a building alone at night?

07:17.915 --> 07:20.135
There has to be a
reason she was there.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.093
Look if there is,
we haven't found it.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.182
As far as we can tell,

07:24.226 --> 07:26.968
your mother was at the
wrong place at the wrong time.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.796
It was a mugging gone bad.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.624
So that's it?

07:30.667 --> 07:32.887
No, if anything new comes up,
of course we'll look into it.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.497
But until then...

07:34.541 --> 07:36.978
Officer Sanchez if you
don't mind, I have things to do.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.153
Yeah.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.850
I mean look,

07:39.894 --> 07:42.549
I really do wish there was
something more I could do it's...

07:45.334 --> 07:46.553
Okay, thank you.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.130
Are you okay?

07:59.174 --> 08:01.698
I can't believe they just
gave up like that.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.874
Mama deserves so much more.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.313
I need to get back to packing.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.359
I'm not even close
to being done.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.448
Did you want me to
start on the photos?

08:14.406 --> 08:16.452
I'm not ready to
put those away yet.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.195
Okay.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.852
Sonya! There you are!

08:25.200 --> 08:26.418
Hey!

08:28.116 --> 08:29.552
I fixed you some of
your favorite chicken.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.249
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.686
Of course I did.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.601
Come on, let's get inside
before this gets cold.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.558
I'm gonna run out
and grab some boxes.

08:36.602 --> 08:37.517
I'll be right back.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.561
Save me some!

08:45.002 --> 08:46.526
Sorry, we've been
packing like crazy.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.876
The realtor wants me to have
the house "show ready"

08:48.919 --> 08:50.268
before I head back.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.227
You sure are taking
on a lot, mighty fast.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.402
Are you okay?

08:53.445 --> 08:54.882
Yeah.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.840
Oh honey, at my age
I have to watch my figure.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.499
These biscuits are delicious.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.936
Reminds me of when you
used to bring them over

09:05.980 --> 09:08.330
every Friday night
when I was a little girl.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.680
Your mom and I used to
spend every Friday night

09:10.724 --> 09:12.421
scrap-booking together.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.077
I'm gonna miss her.

09:19.994 --> 09:24.738
She was such a lovely,
wonderful, generous person.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.089
She really was.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.047
Oh listen to me
rattling on like this.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.180
I, um, I have to get home.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.617
My nephew is coming over
to install one of those

09:34.661 --> 09:36.358
security cameras
at my front door.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.142
He says it'll make
me sleep better.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.318
I think it's all about
making him feel better.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.711
Have there been break-ins?

09:41.755 --> 09:44.366
Yeah, at the Wilkinsens',
a couple of months ago.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.976
Things are changing.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.371
Well, a security camera
is a great idea.

09:49.414 --> 09:52.330
Thank you for always
being there for me, Auntie.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.551
You're like one
of my own, Sonya.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.336
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.053
I'm back.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.707
Up here!

11:04.751 --> 11:06.317
Sorry it took me so long.

11:11.845 --> 11:12.497
Hey.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.368
Hey.

11:14.935 --> 11:18.242
I can't believe Mama
kept all these things.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.158
I think this was my diaper bag
when I was a baby.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.639
Uh, that's a designer bag.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.945
That's worth a fortune!

11:24.988 --> 11:26.816
Really?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.644
How do you know?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.733
My stepmom bought one
for her baby.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.822
She saw some celebrity
with it online or something.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.954
Can I see?

11:33.997 --> 11:36.217
Well then it's
definitely not mine.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.785
You know how practical Mama was.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.178
She probably found it at
one of those thrift stores

11:41.222 --> 11:43.224
she would shop at.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.400
Always raising money
for the church.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.621
I wonder what it was
doing with my things.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.365
Uh, you should
check the pockets.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.759
Yeah.

12:16.170 --> 12:16.953
What is it?

12:18.781 --> 12:20.783
It looks like a
birth certificate.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.742
For who?

12:22.785 --> 12:26.006
Someone named Heather Bradley?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.225
Who's that?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.879
I don't know.

12:31.272 --> 12:34.754
Daughter of Don Bradley
and Olivia Bradley.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.799
Olivia Bradley?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.975
She's one of the
richest women in town.

12:39.019 --> 12:39.759
Really?

12:39.802 --> 12:40.847
Yeah.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.204
What are you doing?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.120
Searching for the name
Heather Bradley.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.818
Did you find something?

12:58.690 --> 13:00.954
Church kidnapping
remains unsolved.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.261
Parents of missing baby
plead for her safe return.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.614
Why did Mama have this
girl's birth certificate?

13:09.658 --> 13:11.094
Well, you said it yourself.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.617
Your mom loved the
secondhand shops.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.358
They probably just
donated the bag

13:14.402 --> 13:15.925
after their daughter
disappeared.

13:15.969 --> 13:16.926
Yeah.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.406
Right.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.584
I gotta get to that shift
at the hospital.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.934
You should probably try
and sleep tonight.

13:24.978 --> 13:25.630
Mhm.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.197
Promise?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.459
Yeah.

13:28.503 --> 13:29.765
'Kay.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.877
Sonya?

13:56.183 --> 13:58.533
Last night, I had the
worst shift ever,

13:58.576 --> 14:01.362
this woman started
freaking out...

14:02.319 --> 14:04.104
Did you sleep at all?

14:04.147 --> 14:05.540
I've been up all night

14:05.583 --> 14:08.935
just thinking about
this missing baby.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.590
Take a look at this.

14:13.635 --> 14:17.334
It's an article
about the kidnapping.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.033
Those poor people.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.470
They never found out what
happened to their daughter.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.515
You know, if it bothers
you this much

14:24.559 --> 14:26.430
you could just give
the police a call.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.779
What if they think Mama

14:27.823 --> 14:29.433
had something to do
with the kidnapping?

14:29.477 --> 14:30.782
Don't be ridiculous.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.306
Your mother never even
had a speeding ticket!

14:32.349 --> 14:34.917
Do you think this could have
had anything to do with

14:34.961 --> 14:36.440
what happened to her?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.747
What makes you say that?

14:38.790 --> 14:42.751
I don't know.
Just a feeling.

14:42.794 --> 14:47.060
Okay, I have this
friend from tennis.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.802
And he used to be a cop, but now
he has his own PI agency.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.066
And he specializes in
helping people find

14:53.109 --> 14:58.810
their missing family members.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.768
Maybe he can help.

14:59.811 --> 15:00.160
Yeah...

15:00.203 --> 15:01.117
Okay.

15:53.387 --> 15:54.562
You must be Sonya?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.129
Missy's friend.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.087
I'm Brandon.
Brandon Hayes.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.918
Uh, thanks for meeting
me on such short notice.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.702
Why don't we continue
this in my office.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.661
Yeah.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.665
So you said you found this
in your mother's closet?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.145
Yeah.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.363
When I was packing her
things, after the funeral.

16:13.407 --> 16:17.411
Yeah, um Missy told me
what happened.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.717
I'm very sorry.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.720
Are you familiar with
the Heather Bradley story?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.070
The kidnapping?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.723
Yeah, I looked into it.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.943
It's a 25-year old cold case.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.249
Heather's mother Olivia Bradley,

16:29.292 --> 16:30.946
the daughter of Richard Mitchell

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
of Mitchell Strategic
Engineering.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.994
He made his fortune from
supplying guidance systems

16:35.037 --> 16:36.734
to the government.

16:36.778 --> 16:39.259
Heather's father Don took over
after the company

16:39.302 --> 16:42.436
after the CEO, Mark Green, died.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.786
Their daughter, Heather, was
taken from the church nursery

16:44.829 --> 16:47.049
when she was just
four months old.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.009
I can't imagine.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.229
Why didn't you go to
the police with this?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.710
This is... this is evidence in
a missing person's case.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.541
I'm sorry.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.805
I think I made
a mistake coming here...

17:03.848 --> 17:04.848
Don't leave, don't leave.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.808
We don't have to
go to the police.

17:06.851 --> 17:07.983
I know my mother.

17:08.027 --> 17:08.983
She's a good woman.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.333
A devout Christian.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.813
She wouldn't have
anything to do with this.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.292
So why'd you come to me?

17:13.336 --> 17:15.121
I can't help but wonder if it

17:15.164 --> 17:17.992
might have something
to do with the murder.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.519
Well I can look into this
with you, discreetly.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.262
Please have a seat.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.356
So, how do we start?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.924
Well, I'll need to get a copy
of your birth certificate.

17:35.967 --> 17:36.707
What for?

17:36.751 --> 17:38.405
It's just a formality.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.451
I just want to
rule some things out.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.670
I live in Baltimore.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.106
It's in a safety deposit box.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.934
Okay.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.240
Well, I'll have a copy pulled
from the county clerk's office.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.372
'Kay.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.159
It's a good thing what
you're doing, Ms. Daniels.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.291
We're going to get to
the bottom of this.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.268
9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

19:42.311 --> 19:44.226
There's someone in my house.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.575
5427 Villawood Court.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.316
Please hurry!

19:50.711 --> 19:52.669
Doesn't look like
anything's missing.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.931
Well, you probably
interrupted them.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.846
First my mother and...

19:55.890 --> 19:57.413
Now this?

19:57.457 --> 20:00.373
You put your mom's obituary
in the newspaper, right?

20:00.416 --> 20:01.722
Yeah.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.245
Yeah, we've had a
string of these lately.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.204
Seems like somebody's
been scanning the obits

20:05.247 --> 20:06.727
for easy targets.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.816
Why would someone do that?

20:08.859 --> 20:11.166
I stopped asking myself
that question years ago.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.167
Sonya.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.473
I came as soon as I could.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.909
You okay?

20:16.258 --> 20:18.217
Hayes?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.130
Oh.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.958
Well this is a surprise.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.047
Yeah, it's been too long.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.005
Yeah.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.792
Hector and I used to be
partners back in the day.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.360
Well that's before Brandon
decided that he could

20:31.404 --> 20:34.276
actually do better
without the force.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.756
So you two know each other?

20:35.799 --> 20:37.584
Yeah, yeah.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.847
A mutual friend introduced us.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.501
So, what did you guys find?

20:41.544 --> 20:44.286
Well Ms. Daniels seems to
have uh, interrupted them

20:44.330 --> 20:47.246
before they had a chance
to take anything.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.422
I don't think they'll
be back any time soon.

20:49.465 --> 20:50.945
If you do find anything missing,

20:50.988 --> 20:53.121
give me a call
and let me know, okay?

20:53.164 --> 20:54.949
I'll see myself out.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.385
Wrap it up, let's go!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.607
Thank you for not
saying anything.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.217
No I wouldn't break
a client's confidence.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.958
C'mon.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.220
I work for you, remember?

21:07.701 --> 21:11.444
Would you feel safer if you
stayed at Missy's tonight?

21:11.487 --> 21:12.967
Yeah, that's a good idea.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.925
Okay, well let me
give you a ride.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.187
You shouldn't be driving.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.102
You don't - don't
have to do that.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.671
No c'mon, I'd like to.

21:21.715 --> 21:24.326
Okay, um let just me
grab a few things.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.849
Okay.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.512
I still don't get why the cops

21:36.556 --> 21:38.340
are so quick to
dismiss everything.

21:38.384 --> 21:41.169
It's like they want to file
things away as fast as possible.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.562
I know.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.303
That's why I'm really glad
Brandon's helping.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.434
He seems nice.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.001
He is.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.872
He's been through a lot, though.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.048
His, uh, wife ran off
with his best friend.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.354
Yeah, cleaned him out too.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.399
It was awful.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.225
That's terrible.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.052
Yeah.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.968
Here you go.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.406
You could probably use
a good night's sleep, huh?

22:00.449 --> 22:02.146
You have no idea.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.587
And I, I just-I just
can't help but thinking

22:07.630 --> 22:09.458
that the cops are
missing something.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.591
You know with Mama
in the garage at night,

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
and the diaper bag, it...

22:13.636 --> 22:16.465
Doesn't it all
feel coincidental.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.163
I think you might be spooked
from the break-in.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.905
And that you should try
and get some sleep.

22:21.949 --> 22:24.386
Hey, you're safe here.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.521
Okay? And I'm in the
next room if you need me.

22:28.564 --> 22:32.046
Okay.

22:32.089 --> 22:32.481
'Night.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.497
Eat something Hun.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.195
You can't have just coffee
to keep you going.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.719
Thanks.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.896
You sure you don't want to
spend the night again?

22:55.939 --> 22:58.594
I gotta finish packing
my mom's house.

23:00.770 --> 23:04.252
Um, okay, I will leave
a key under my mat.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.602
In case you change your mind.

23:10.432 --> 23:10.954
Hey.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.565
Hey, come on in.

23:12.608 --> 23:13.522
How are you doing?

23:13.566 --> 23:14.088
Good.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.091
Oh this is a surprise.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.528
I'm just heading to work.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.138
Um, is everything okay?

23:21.182 --> 23:23.837
Yeah, I just need to talk
with Sonya for a minute.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.055
If that's alright.

23:25.099 --> 23:29.320
Yeah, hey, my
invitation still stands.

23:30.887 --> 23:31.758
Bye.

23:31.801 --> 23:34.674
Is everything okay?

23:35.675 --> 23:38.721
My contact at the registry,

23:38.765 --> 23:41.158
he tried to pull up
your birth certificate.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.290
Tried?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.987
There's no easy way to say this.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.381
There's no certificate on file.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.687
What do you mean?

23:47.730 --> 23:50.298
I told you I have a
copy of it back home.

23:50.341 --> 23:55.608
There's no record of your
mother ever having given birth.

23:55.651 --> 23:59.046
Not locally, not anywhere.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.003
What?

24:02.963 --> 24:05.182
That doesn't make any sense.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.403
Listen Sonya, you found
a birth certificate

24:08.447 --> 24:12.451
in your mother's closet
for a missing child

24:12.494 --> 24:15.105
who's nearly the exact
same age as you are.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.151
And now there's no
official record of your birth.

24:21.547 --> 24:25.028
That certificate that you have,
I think it's a fake.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.600
I'm sorry.

24:31.644 --> 24:35.735
This is crazy.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.563
My mother and father
would have never...

24:37.606 --> 24:40.696
Listen, we still don't know
anything for sure.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.393
I need answers.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.483
Okay, we have to
talk to the Bradley's.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.268
I don't think we're there yet.

24:47.311 --> 24:50.227
Brandon, I am not asking.

24:50.271 --> 24:53.187
If there is a slightest chance
that I'm Heather Bradley,

24:55.624 --> 24:57.017
I need to see them.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.803
Okay.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.457
If you feel that
strongly about it.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.917
Wow. This is impressive.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.009
Mitchell Engineering
has been very successful.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.969
Mr. Bradley is about to
take the company public.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.841
It's been all over the news.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.724
Sorry to keep you waiting.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.117
Ah, Mr. Bradley.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.815
I'm Brandon Hayes
with Finding The Lost.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.294
We spoke on the phone.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.818
Please call me, Don.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.601
Right.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.300
And you must be Sonya Daniels.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.172
The woman who
found the diaper bag.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.566
I thought it would be
the right thing to do.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.829
To return the bag.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.395
Well, please come in.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.310
Make yourselves at home.

26:18.359 --> 26:21.101
Will Mrs. Bradley
be joining us?

26:21.144 --> 26:23.625
No, Olivia's at
the gym right now.

26:23.669 --> 26:27.760
The truth is, I'd prefer that
she be left out of this for now.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.763
As you can imagine, the loss of
our daughter was devastating.

26:30.806 --> 26:34.070
And I'd just prefer not to open
old wounds for the time being.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.376
Yeah, of course.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.812
I haven't discussed
with the police yet.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.162
We thought it'd be best
to let you know first.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.468
I appreciate that.

26:40.511 --> 26:43.123
My wife has suffered
from extreme anxiety

26:43.166 --> 26:44.690
since our daughter disappeared.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.171
She's on anti-depressants.

26:49.172 --> 26:52.306
Involving the police might
open everything up again I...

26:52.349 --> 26:55.962
I don't think that would be a
good thing for Olivia right now.

26:56.005 --> 27:00.009
Is it, uh, in there?

27:00.053 --> 27:00.793
Yeah.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.557
This is it.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.648
This was Heather's bag.

27:33.608 --> 27:36.132
I'm sorry. I, uh...

27:36.176 --> 27:42.312
I didn't realize how painful
this would be for me.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.629
You mentioned something
about a birth certificate?

27:54.673 --> 27:55.978
Yeah, I believe it's authentic,

27:56.022 --> 27:58.372
but I've sent it out
to be verified.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.504
Do you mind if I ask you

28:00.548 --> 28:02.071
why your daughter's birth
certificate

28:02.115 --> 28:04.117
was in the diaper bag?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.424
Well, we'd... we'd recently moved.

28:07.468 --> 28:09.296
Our mail was being forwarded,

28:09.339 --> 28:12.821
so it took longer
than usual to arrive.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.258
My wife told me she'd
found it in the mailbox

28:15.302 --> 28:17.304
on the way to the
park with Heather.

28:17.347 --> 28:20.046
She'd put it in the bag
for safekeeping

28:20.089 --> 28:25.007
and forgot all about it until
after Heather disappeared.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.879
Whoever took our daughter

28:26.922 --> 28:30.447
must have taken the
diaper bag as well.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.755
All these years, my wife
never gave up hope.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.715
Not even after we adopted
our son, Grayson.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.675
Grayson, I didn't
realize you were home.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.722
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.422
Well this certainly
is a new approach.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.119
I give you credit
for your originality.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.512
None of the others
brought props.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.601
Grayson, please.

28:53.644 --> 28:56.082
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

28:56.125 --> 28:57.736
Who do you think you're fooling?

28:59.389 --> 29:02.523
You're just another gold-digger
like the rest of them.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.220
Grayson! That's enough!

29:05.787 --> 29:09.225
Please accept my sincere
apology for my son's behavior.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.446
I'm not going to stand here
and listen to this.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.801
I'm very sorry.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.542
It's been hard for him living
in his sister's shadow

29:21.585 --> 29:22.761
all these years.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.024
Watching his mother
get her hopes up,

29:25.067 --> 29:26.939
only to be crushed.

29:29.855 --> 29:33.728
As you can see, he's become
very protective of her.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.992
What did he mean,
"the rest of them"?

29:37.036 --> 29:40.517
Have there been women
claiming that they were Heather?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.824
I'm afraid so.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.435
It's been difficult for Olivia.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.742
She wanted so badly to believe
they were Heather,

29:47.786 --> 29:53.835
but after each DNA test
came back negative, well...

29:53.879 --> 29:58.927
Let's just say being
wealthy has it's drawbacks.

29:58.971 --> 30:02.191
In hindsight perhaps she
shouldn't have offered a reward.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.672
I'm-I'm not looking
for a reward.

30:04.715 --> 30:05.586
Don?

30:10.069 --> 30:11.418
What's the matter with Grayson?

30:11.461 --> 30:13.420
He just rushed
right by me in a huff.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.641
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize
we were expecting company.

30:17.685 --> 30:18.904
I must look a mess.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.775
We were just finishing up, dear.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.865
I would have mentioned
that I had a meeting,

30:23.909 --> 30:26.868
but I thought you'd still be
working with your trainer.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.479
Oh, I was getting one of
my migraine headaches

30:29.523 --> 30:32.526
so he decided to quit early.

30:32.569 --> 30:36.269
You usually tell me when you
have a meeting at the house.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.532
Look, why don't you
go rest for a bit.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.621
I wouldn't want your
headache to get worse.

30:40.664 --> 30:41.927
Remember what
the doctor told you.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.020
Please don't speak to me
like I'm a child!

30:55.505 --> 30:56.942
Please, excuse me for a moment.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.508
Yeah.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.644
Olivia!

31:03.687 --> 31:04.688
I'm fine.

31:18.224 --> 31:23.794
I've tried to put that photo
away, but Olivia won't let me.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.535
That was Mark Green.

31:25.579 --> 31:29.104
Olivia was going to ask him
to be Heather's godfather,

31:29.148 --> 31:32.542
but he died shortly after
that photo was taken.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.765
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be rude but,

31:37.808 --> 31:40.333
I think it would be
best if you left.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.509
I really can't risk upsetting
my wife any further.

31:42.552 --> 31:43.989
Yeah, no, we understand.

31:44.032 --> 31:45.904
I appreciate you seeing us.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.717
Wait, let me go in first.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.858
Wait here, I'll make
sure it's safe.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.669
It's clear.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.671
My mother was a rock.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.543
She really held it together
for the both of us

33:00.587 --> 33:01.544
after my father died.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.681
They were God-fearing
church-going people,

33:07.724 --> 33:09.422
they were... they were good
people.

33:19.823 --> 33:22.783
Do you think I look
like Mrs. Bradley?

33:22.826 --> 33:24.785
Well, that's not really
for me to say.

33:24.828 --> 33:28.136
We need to do a DNA test
and see if it's a match.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.878
If the results
come back positive,

33:30.921 --> 33:32.532
I don't think I can handle that.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.579
What would you do,
if you were me?

33:36.623 --> 33:39.582
I'm not the person you
should be asking for advice.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.498
Why not?

33:42.542 --> 33:44.587
Well, my childhood I bounced
from one foster home

33:44.631 --> 33:46.807
to the next.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.939
No expert on family.

33:48.983 --> 33:52.160
I'm sorry. That must've
been hard.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.076
Whatever doesn't kill us
only makes us stronger,

33:55.120 --> 33:56.860
am I right?

33:56.904 --> 33:57.426
Yeah...

33:57.470 --> 33:58.993
So...

34:00.647 --> 34:02.083
What do you think?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.523
How do we do the DNA test?

34:07.567 --> 34:09.438
Do we need the
Bradleys' consent?

34:09.482 --> 34:11.614
The police records for the
kidnapping mention there being

34:11.658 --> 34:13.964
a sample of Heather's
DNA on file.

34:14.007 --> 34:17.098
I can pull a favor from a
friend of mine in the lab.

34:17.141 --> 34:18.404
He can keep it confidential.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.146
And all you'll need
is to take a swab.

34:21.188 --> 34:23.235
I'll take care of this
as quickly as possible.

34:23.277 --> 34:24.801
Alright?

34:30.632 --> 34:33.071
Brandon, um...

34:33.114 --> 34:35.333
I just wanted to say that
I really appreciate

34:35.377 --> 34:36.465
everything you're doing for me.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.206
Will you be okay?

34:40.774 --> 34:42.471
I'll be okay.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.821
You know, you can call me
if you need anything.

34:44.864 --> 34:46.170
Anything at all.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.650
Alright?

35:08.932 --> 35:10.717
That woman, who was
here yesterday...

35:10.760 --> 35:12.066
Who was she?

35:15.287 --> 35:17.158
A business associate.

35:18.681 --> 35:22.032
Are they the ones helping you
take the company public?

35:27.255 --> 35:31.259
Why do you always insist on
keeping me in the dark?

35:31.303 --> 35:34.088
My father left this
company to me!

35:34.132 --> 35:36.786
You know, this wasn't what
he wanted for it.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.440
Your father couldn't
have foreseen

35:38.484 --> 35:41.400
how much this company
would grow.

35:41.443 --> 35:44.490
Business is about evolution.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.884
We agreed it was best for me
to handle the company's affairs

35:47.928 --> 35:50.496
when you gave me
power of attorney, didn't we?

35:50.539 --> 35:54.195
I have the right to be
involved in this decision!

35:54.239 --> 35:55.979
You know it's not good for you

35:56.023 --> 35:58.156
to get yourself
worked up like this.

35:58.199 --> 36:01.071
I don't want you to end up
in the hospital again.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.465
You need to take your pills.

36:03.509 --> 36:04.771
When Mark was CEO,

36:04.814 --> 36:06.468
he treated me with respect!

36:09.036 --> 36:10.951
I am not going to
stand around here

36:10.994 --> 36:12.692
listening to this craziness.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.870
Take your pill.

36:32.842 --> 36:34.366
That's my girl.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.721
I just want you
to be well, dear.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.251
I'll be home for
dinner, all right?

37:09.444 --> 37:11.272
Thank goodness!
I was so worried.

37:11.316 --> 37:14.319
I came by, but you weren't home
and I heard about the break-in.

37:14.362 --> 37:15.494
Are you... are you all right?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.147
I'm fine.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.932
I stayed at Missy's yesterday
just-just to be safe.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.542
I'm so sorry I didn't call you.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.414
It's okay.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.067
You have a lot on your mind.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.591
Yeah...

37:25.634 --> 37:27.462
I have to talk to you
about something.

37:27.506 --> 37:28.333
Of course.

37:28.376 --> 37:29.725
Let me put the kettle on.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.730
I found something out yesterday.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.297
Something that confused me.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.646
And what was that?

37:39.779 --> 37:42.477
It's a long story, but someone
at the county clerk's office

37:42.521 --> 37:43.913
tried to pull my
birth certificate,

37:43.957 --> 37:46.307
and it's not on file.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.267
And?

37:49.310 --> 37:51.181
Auntie, did my parents ever
mention anything to you

37:51.225 --> 37:52.966
that would make you think
I was adopted?

37:55.403 --> 37:59.364
I always knew
this day would come.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.630
So you knew?

38:07.937 --> 38:08.547
Yes.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.680
You were adopted.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.816
But why would my parents keep
this from me all these years?

38:16.859 --> 38:20.385
Oh honey, they wanted
to tell you, they did,

38:20.428 --> 38:23.257
they just didn't know how.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.520
They wanted to wait
for the right time,

38:25.564 --> 38:27.305
but as the years passed,

38:27.348 --> 38:29.829
they realized they'd
waited too long.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.091
So they lied to me?

38:31.134 --> 38:31.874
No.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.876
No, they protected you.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.315
They never wanted you to doubt
who your real family was.

38:40.666 --> 38:44.496
Your-your parents had tried for
so long to have a child,

38:44.539 --> 38:48.369
but your mama, well
she couldn't conceive.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.154
So who are my birth parents?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.939
I don't know.

38:52.982 --> 38:58.379
Your mother hired one of those,
um, private adoption attorneys.

38:58.423 --> 39:02.470
The only thing he told her
was that your birth mother

39:02.514 --> 39:04.516
had died when she had you.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.779
Did you ever know the name
of the attorney?

39:06.822 --> 39:08.781
Oh honey, that was
a long time ago.

39:08.824 --> 39:13.307
I don't know that I ever
even knew the name.

39:13.351 --> 39:17.485
I-I-I don't want to stickin' my
nose where it doesn't belong,

39:17.529 --> 39:21.533
but your parents raised you

39:21.576 --> 39:24.231
with all the love
they had to give.

39:27.582 --> 39:33.501
If you ask me,
nothing else should matter.

39:33.545 --> 39:36.548
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to tell you.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.552
Me too.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.303
Is that the security camera
your nephew installed?

39:53.347 --> 39:56.176
Oh! He's quite the handy man.
It's so small.

39:56.219 --> 39:58.700
It's hard to believe it holds
a weeks worth of video.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.180
Auntie.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.573
I'm wondering if it maybe
recorded the person

40:01.616 --> 40:03.401
who tried to break into
Mama's house last week.

40:03.444 --> 40:06.273
Oh my goodness, why didn't
I think of that?

40:06.316 --> 40:07.666
Can I look at the footage?

40:07.709 --> 40:08.971
By all means.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.420
Mom?

40:24.073 --> 40:25.510
Oh. Grayson.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.387
The other day when I
saw you in the driveway.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.476
There was a woman here.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.523
Your father said she was
a business associate.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.482
I think he was lying to me.

40:45.704 --> 40:48.663
Did she say she was Heather?

40:48.707 --> 40:49.882
She's just like the others,

40:51.753 --> 40:53.494
Don't even waste
your time with her.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.626
What did she say?

40:54.669 --> 40:55.757
Grayson...

40:55.801 --> 40:57.585
Tell me, I need to know!

40:57.629 --> 41:00.501
She's just another lowlife
looking for a handout.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.981
I told her to get lost.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.461
What if it's her?

41:03.504 --> 41:05.767
It isn't.

41:05.811 --> 41:11.164
Ma, I am not going to let
one more person

41:11.207 --> 41:12.470
put you through that.

41:28.877 --> 41:31.837
If what Phyllis told

41:31.880 --> 41:34.448
really was private, there's a
good chance that the records

41:34.492 --> 41:36.885
are sealed along with the names
of your birth parents.

41:36.929 --> 41:38.844
Are you kidding?

41:38.887 --> 41:43.457
Oh, uh - my friend at the
lab had sent this over.

41:45.328 --> 41:47.679
He's going to run the
test under the radar.

41:47.722 --> 41:51.160
You just take a swab on
the inside of your cheek.

41:51.204 --> 41:54.163
It'll take a couple of days for
the test results to get back.

42:06.175 --> 42:08.308
I e-mailed you footage
from Phyllis' security camera.

42:08.351 --> 42:10.310
I thought it might have
caught the person

42:10.353 --> 42:12.312
who tried to break into
my mother's house.

42:12.355 --> 42:14.967
You keep this up and I
might be on the market

42:15.010 --> 42:16.185
for a partner one day.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.580
I thought I'd head over to the
church where Heather was taken,

42:19.624 --> 42:21.016
see if anyone remembers
seeing anything

42:21.060 --> 42:22.365
the day she disappeared.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.498
What did you say the name
of the church was?

42:24.542 --> 42:25.020
Faith United.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.763
You want me to come with?

42:28.807 --> 42:31.592
I got this, partner.

42:36.815 --> 42:38.381
Well regardless of
what happens now,

42:38.425 --> 42:42.385
at least we know my parents
are innocent in all of this.

42:43.909 --> 42:44.910
What?

42:44.953 --> 42:46.912
It's nothing.

42:46.955 --> 42:48.957
It's something.

42:49.001 --> 42:51.917
You know, for a P.I., you have
a terrible poker face.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.834
Well it's just that, uh,
you know, this is my job.

42:55.877 --> 43:01.317
You can't ever rule anything out
until you have conclusive proof.

43:03.798 --> 43:05.670
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

43:05.713 --> 43:07.193
I just... this... this is...

43:07.236 --> 43:09.195
It's fine. Just call me when
you get the results.

43:19.684 --> 43:21.076
Excuse me, Pastor?

43:23.165 --> 43:24.036
Oh yes.

43:24.079 --> 43:25.515
Yes, how can I help you?

43:25.559 --> 43:27.039
I'm Sonya Daniels.

43:27.082 --> 43:28.823
Nice to meet you, Sonya.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.869
You have a very
beautiful church.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.305
Thank you.

43:32.348 --> 43:34.089
Have you been a pastor
here for a long time?

43:34.133 --> 43:36.526
Started out as
the Youth minster.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.354
Now here I am, 30 years later.

43:38.398 --> 43:40.400
Still shepherding
this congregation.

43:40.443 --> 43:43.055
I was hoping you might
be able to help me out.

43:43.098 --> 43:44.578
I'm doing research for the old

43:44.622 --> 43:47.799
Heather Bradley incident
for a friend.

43:47.842 --> 43:49.539
Were you here when
she went missing?

43:49.583 --> 43:51.803
I was, but the police,

43:51.846 --> 43:53.892
you know, they did an
extensive investigation.

43:53.935 --> 43:56.416
They cleared the church
of any wrongdoing.

43:56.459 --> 43:59.158
If you don't mind, I'd rather
not dwell on the past.

43:59.201 --> 44:01.160
No one is implying that the
church was responsible

44:01.203 --> 44:02.640
in any way.

44:02.683 --> 44:05.599
Just trying to make sense
of what happened.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.949
Okay, what do you want to know?

44:07.993 --> 44:10.169
Would I be able to
speak with the person

44:10.212 --> 44:12.345
who ran the nursery back then?

44:12.388 --> 44:14.042
I'm afraid that's not possible.

44:14.086 --> 44:17.437
She died a few years ago...

44:17.480 --> 44:20.875
It was very sad; She never was
able to forgive herself

44:20.919 --> 44:22.790
for what happened.

44:22.834 --> 44:24.923
Could you walk me through
what happened that day,

44:24.966 --> 44:27.012
whatever you can remember?

44:27.055 --> 44:30.102
Okay, come this way.

44:33.888 --> 44:35.890
This used to be the
children's play room.

44:35.934 --> 44:41.026
And that over there was
the nursery for the babies.

44:41.069 --> 44:44.986
Heather was one of our youngest
so she was separated

44:45.030 --> 44:47.162
from the others who were
playing while she slept.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.034
How did you keep track of them?

44:49.077 --> 44:51.950
The parents would fill out
their names and times

44:51.993 --> 44:53.255
when they arrived and left.

44:53.299 --> 44:54.735
Do you still have that?

44:54.779 --> 44:56.084
No, it was decades ago.

44:56.128 --> 44:59.131
I'm sure it's been
turned over to the police.

44:59.174 --> 45:01.655
When did they realize
Heather was missing?

45:01.699 --> 45:05.485
I'm ashamed to say that nobody
noticed until the nanny came by

45:05.528 --> 45:08.488
to pick her up that afternoon.

45:08.531 --> 45:10.751
Do you remember
the nanny's name?

45:10.795 --> 45:12.666
How could I forget?

45:12.710 --> 45:14.537
Rebecca Gold.

45:14.581 --> 45:16.757
Nobody reported seeing
any strangers

45:16.801 --> 45:18.063
in the church that day?

45:18.106 --> 45:20.761
No. And that always
bothered me.

45:23.808 --> 45:25.810
I appreciate you
showing me around.

45:25.853 --> 45:28.464
My pleasure.

45:28.508 --> 45:32.207
Oh Sonya, is there anyone
you want remembered

45:32.251 --> 45:34.470
in our evening prayers tonight?

45:34.514 --> 45:37.691
Yes, that's very kind.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.998
My mother, Janet Daniels.

45:40.041 --> 45:42.522
Janet Daniels?

45:43.392 --> 45:44.959
It rings a bell.

45:48.310 --> 45:53.446
I think your mother used to sing
in our choir many years ago.

45:53.489 --> 45:54.969
She did?

45:55.013 --> 45:57.667
She changed churches,
like a lot of others did,

45:57.711 --> 45:59.191
after Heather disappeared.

46:08.504 --> 46:09.767
She was there, Brandon.

46:09.810 --> 46:10.245
What?

46:10.289 --> 46:11.769
My mother.

46:11.812 --> 46:13.683
The Pastor said she used to
sing in the church choir

46:13.727 --> 46:15.163
and she left after
Heather disappeared.

46:15.207 --> 46:16.817
Well there's probably
a lot of people

46:16.861 --> 46:17.905
that left after that.

46:17.949 --> 46:19.733
Doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

46:21.648 --> 46:24.607
Yeah, yeah you're right.

46:24.651 --> 46:25.870
Did you get anything else?

46:25.913 --> 46:27.480
No one remembered
seeing any strangers.

46:27.523 --> 46:29.874
It was Heather's nanny who
realized she was missing.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.614
Okay, did... did you get her name?

46:31.658 --> 46:33.529
Yeah, um Rebecca Gold.

46:33.573 --> 46:34.922
We should talk to her.

46:34.966 --> 46:36.750
When the police have
already cleared her?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.447
Maybe they didn't ask
the right questions.

46:38.491 --> 46:40.667
I'll see if she
still lives in town.

46:40.710 --> 46:42.495
Maybe she'll meet with us.

46:42.538 --> 46:43.757
Okay...

46:44.889 --> 46:46.368
What is that?

46:46.412 --> 46:48.457
Oh, it's from Phyllis'
security camera.

46:48.501 --> 46:52.548
I was able to isolate the frame
of a man who was outside

46:52.592 --> 46:54.420
your mother's house
during the break in.

46:54.463 --> 46:57.466
It's a little bit blurry,
but you see this right here?

46:57.510 --> 46:58.859
On the sweatshirt.

46:58.903 --> 47:00.252
I think it's some
sort of uh, crest.

47:00.295 --> 47:02.645
I e-mailed it to
a tech guy I know

47:02.689 --> 47:04.865
to see if he could reduce
the digital noise.

47:04.909 --> 47:07.302
It's a long shot, but maybe
it'll help us identify

47:07.346 --> 47:09.043
whoever broke into
your mother's house.

47:09.087 --> 47:11.698
In the meantime, I'm gonna
see what I can find

47:11.741 --> 47:12.960
on Rebecca Gold.

47:13.004 --> 47:14.048
All right.

47:14.092 --> 47:15.658
You call me if
you need anything.

47:15.702 --> 47:16.572
Oh and Sonya?

47:17.312 --> 47:19.184
I'm sorry about earlier.

47:19.227 --> 47:20.359
It's okay.

47:20.402 --> 47:22.491
I hope you know
you're not alone.

47:22.535 --> 47:23.666
I'm here for you.

47:43.773 --> 47:45.340
There's nothing here.

47:50.519 --> 47:52.565
Who is it?

47:52.608 --> 47:54.175
Grayson Bradley.

47:57.048 --> 48:00.181
You think you can just walk into
my family's life and hurt us?

48:00.225 --> 48:02.314
I'm sorry, I was
just trying to...

48:02.357 --> 48:04.316
You're not fooling anyone.

48:04.359 --> 48:05.665
Back off.

48:07.710 --> 48:09.582
My family has already
been through enough!

48:09.625 --> 48:12.019
So, stay away from us or
you're gonna regret it!

48:27.730 --> 48:28.470
Hello?

48:28.514 --> 48:29.819
Is this Rebecca Gold?

48:29.863 --> 48:31.212
Yes it is. Who's calling?

48:31.256 --> 48:33.475
This is Brandon Hayes
with Finding The Lost.

48:33.519 --> 48:35.564
I've been hired to look into
the Heather Bradley

48:35.608 --> 48:37.131
missing persons case.

48:37.175 --> 48:39.307
I thought that was
closed years ago.

48:39.351 --> 48:41.048
Well, we've recently found
some new evidence

48:41.092 --> 48:43.311
that may help us solve
what happened to Heather.

48:43.355 --> 48:45.748
I was wondering if maybe
I could come by tomorrow,

48:45.792 --> 48:47.228
ask you a few questions?

48:47.272 --> 48:49.796
Uh, I-I really don't know
what kinda help I can be.

48:49.839 --> 48:51.885
It was... it was a long time ago

48:51.929 --> 48:54.235
and I've tried really hard
to put that behind me.

48:54.279 --> 48:57.021
Ms. Gold, please.

48:57.064 --> 48:59.066
It would bring the Bradley
family some peace

48:59.110 --> 49:01.112
to finally know what happened
to their little girl.

49:04.942 --> 49:05.638
Okay.

49:07.292 --> 49:08.075
Thanks.

49:08.597 --> 49:09.468
I'll see you tomorrow.

49:09.947 --> 49:10.599
Yeah.

49:22.698 --> 49:23.786
C'mon.

49:23.830 --> 49:25.310
We got a problem.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.057
Thank you for
coming over so quickly.

49:33.100 --> 49:34.580
I can't believe he did that.

49:39.280 --> 49:42.544
Grayson obviously feels
really threatened by me.

49:42.588 --> 49:44.416
Maybe he thinks I'm
after his inheritance.

49:44.459 --> 49:46.548
I'm... I'm just trying
to find the truth.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.681
And I have no idea
why this is happening.

49:48.724 --> 49:52.206
Okay, it's all right.

49:52.250 --> 49:53.903
I'm sorry, it's...

49:53.947 --> 49:55.122
With everything going on,

49:55.166 --> 49:57.037
I really haven't had
any time to grieve.

49:57.081 --> 49:58.343
No, you don't have to apologize.

50:01.868 --> 50:04.088
You've been so kind to me.

50:04.131 --> 50:05.785
I told you, I'm here to help.

50:17.362 --> 50:19.929
I'm sorry.

50:19.973 --> 50:21.018
We shouldn't do that.

50:21.061 --> 50:23.063
You know, you're a client.

50:23.107 --> 50:24.717
I don't know what's got into me.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.545
I'm sorry.

50:26.588 --> 50:29.896
It's fine, just everything's a
little complicated right now.

50:39.123 --> 50:40.863
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

50:40.907 --> 50:42.387
No, not at all.

50:43.605 --> 50:46.043
Um... I just remembered something

50:46.086 --> 50:47.740
that might be important.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.351
Um...

50:50.395 --> 50:53.093
Last time I saw your mom,
we were here scrap booking,

50:53.137 --> 50:54.312
and she got a call.

50:54.355 --> 50:55.400
A call from who?

50:55.443 --> 50:56.923
That's just it, I don't know.

50:56.966 --> 50:58.838
She left the room to take it.

50:58.881 --> 51:01.928
She never did that, at the time
I didn't think much of it.

51:01.971 --> 51:04.104
But, when she came back
into the room,

51:04.148 --> 51:06.411
she seemed really shaken up.

51:06.454 --> 51:09.109
I asked her what was wrong,
she said she was fine,

51:09.153 --> 51:11.807
didn't want to talk about it,
so I didn't pry.

51:11.851 --> 51:14.767
But whoever it was on the
other end of that phone,

51:14.810 --> 51:15.942
really upset her.

51:17.291 --> 51:18.640
It might not mean anything.

51:18.684 --> 51:21.339
I... I dunno, I just thought
you should know.

51:24.429 --> 51:26.344
Thank you, Auntie.

51:26.387 --> 51:27.823
Of course.

51:27.867 --> 51:28.781
I'd best be going.

51:39.270 --> 51:40.271
What? What is it?

51:42.490 --> 51:43.926
I just thought of something.

51:50.455 --> 51:51.673
My mother had this habit.

51:51.717 --> 51:52.979
Whenever someone would call,

51:53.022 --> 51:56.635
she would scribble down
notes on a notepad.

51:56.678 --> 51:57.723
There's nothing here.

51:59.855 --> 52:00.813
Hold on one second.

52:06.079 --> 52:09.430
I saw someone do this
on TV once.

52:09.474 --> 52:10.344
Not bad.

52:12.041 --> 52:12.955
It's a phone number.

52:21.790 --> 52:22.791
It's disconnected.

52:23.836 --> 52:25.490
There's another number there.

52:25.533 --> 52:27.753
Looks like it could be
part of an address.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.713
I'm gonna head to the office,

52:31.757 --> 52:34.760
see if I can figure out who this
number used to belong to.

52:35.935 --> 52:37.458
You gonna be okay
if I leave you?

52:37.502 --> 52:39.634
Yeah, um, I'm gonna
head to Missy's.

52:40.896 --> 52:42.811
You want me to give you a ride?

52:42.855 --> 52:44.465
Uh... I'm good, thanks.

52:44.509 --> 52:46.206
Uh, you can... you can go ahead.

53:01.917 --> 53:02.962
Sonya.

53:04.268 --> 53:05.486
Sonya, hey.

53:06.008 --> 53:06.618
Huh?

53:06.661 --> 53:08.054
Your tea?

53:08.097 --> 53:10.012
Oh, sorry.

53:10.056 --> 53:11.362
You okay?

53:12.537 --> 53:14.843
Yeah, it just all
feels so surreal.

53:14.887 --> 53:16.758
Mama, and the birth certificate,

53:16.802 --> 53:19.500
and now Brandon's
doing a DNA test

53:19.544 --> 53:23.069
to see if I'm Heather Bradley.

53:23.112 --> 53:25.245
Well, whatever happens,
you're still Sonya to me.

53:32.948 --> 53:34.428
Brandon. Hi.

53:34.472 --> 53:35.603
Did you find something?

53:35.647 --> 53:37.344
Looks like working
late night paid off.

53:37.388 --> 53:39.128
I tracked that phone
number we found

53:39.172 --> 53:41.479
in your mother's note pad
to a Joseph Coyle,

53:41.522 --> 53:44.264
an attorney who not only
handled private adoptions,

53:44.308 --> 53:47.136
but also represented
Rebecca Gold

53:47.180 --> 53:48.137
during the investigation.

53:48.181 --> 53:49.617
You're kidding.

53:49.661 --> 53:50.314
No.

53:50.357 --> 53:52.881
And there's more.

53:52.925 --> 53:55.319
You're never gonna believe where
this guy's office is located.

53:55.362 --> 53:57.799
Above the parking garage,

53:57.843 --> 53:59.279
where your mother was killed.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.715
No.

54:40.625 --> 54:44.585
I'm sorry.

54:44.629 --> 54:47.893
I should have known how
difficult this would be for you.

54:47.936 --> 54:49.242
Let me take you home.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.112
No.

54:52.376 --> 54:53.681
I need to do this.

54:55.204 --> 54:56.858
I need to know the truth.

55:06.912 --> 55:08.696
We're looking for
a Joseph Coyle.

55:11.699 --> 55:12.961
Who's asking?

55:13.005 --> 55:15.399
Brandon Hayes,
I'm with Finding the Lost.

55:15.442 --> 55:16.617
Looking for some information

55:16.661 --> 55:18.924
about an adoption
you may have handled.

55:18.967 --> 55:21.361
I don't do adoptions anymore.

55:21.405 --> 55:23.232
Oh, well, this was a
long time ago.

55:23.276 --> 55:24.669
25 years.

55:25.539 --> 55:26.758
Did you handle them then?

55:30.152 --> 55:32.981
The adoptive parents were
Terrence and Janet Daniels.

55:38.117 --> 55:42.556
Nope. Nope.
Doesn't ring a bell.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.385
But even if it did, I couldn't
tell you anything.

55:45.429 --> 55:48.083
Attorney-client privilege.

55:48.127 --> 55:51.130
Now if there's nothing else,
I'd like to finish packing.

55:52.610 --> 55:53.828
What's the rush?

55:53.872 --> 55:56.440
Heading down to Florida
with the missus.

55:56.483 --> 55:58.224
Well deserved retirement.

55:58.267 --> 56:01.445
I think my mother, Janet Daniels
came to see you a few weeks ago.

56:01.488 --> 56:03.403
Your name and address
was in her notebook.

56:06.624 --> 56:08.016
Janet Daniels?

56:09.453 --> 56:12.847
Isn't that the woman the
police came by asking about?

56:12.891 --> 56:16.851
Woman who was murdered
in our parking garage?

56:16.895 --> 56:19.941
Well like I told them,
I don't know her

56:19.985 --> 56:22.117
and I don't know what
she was doing here.

56:22.161 --> 56:23.249
I know you're lying!

56:23.292 --> 56:25.643
My name and number's online.

56:25.686 --> 56:28.950
Just because she wrote it down
doesn't mean a thing.

56:35.609 --> 56:36.436
Let's go.

56:50.798 --> 56:51.756
Did you hear him?

56:51.799 --> 56:52.800
How smug he was?

56:52.844 --> 56:54.541
He's hiding something.

56:54.585 --> 56:56.891
If he's involved in any way,
we'll get to the bottom of it.

56:56.935 --> 56:58.415
Let's go talk to Rebecca Gold.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.068
See if she can
tell us something.

57:25.833 --> 57:27.922
You sure she's expecting us?

57:27.966 --> 57:30.447
Yeah, I'm sure.

57:35.147 --> 57:37.279
I hear music, maybe she
can't hear the door.

57:38.324 --> 57:39.412
Alright, let's try around back.

58:01.173 --> 58:01.956
Hello?

58:04.002 --> 58:04.785
Hello!

58:08.223 --> 58:09.442
Stay behind me.

58:18.059 --> 58:18.973
Miss Gold?

58:24.849 --> 58:26.503
Oh my god.

58:31.290 --> 58:32.291
Oh my god.

58:32.334 --> 58:33.510
Don't touch her,
don't touch her.

58:56.968 --> 58:58.578
There's no pulse.

59:05.933 --> 59:07.674
See what's happening
in the basement.

59:11.939 --> 59:13.593
The medical examiner
said she's been dead

59:13.637 --> 59:15.943
for less than two hours.

59:15.987 --> 59:18.119
I can't believe you
didn't tell me this.

59:18.163 --> 59:20.600
You find a missing baby's
diaper bag and birth certificate

59:20.644 --> 59:23.037
in a dead woman's closet...
a woman whose murder

59:23.081 --> 59:24.735
I'm investigating,
and you didn't tell me?

59:24.778 --> 59:26.258
There has been
no clear connection

59:26.301 --> 59:27.738
between the bag that Sonya found

59:27.781 --> 59:29.522
and Janet Daniels'
murder until now.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.219
That's what the police are for.

59:31.263 --> 59:33.221
To investigate potential leads.

59:33.265 --> 59:35.223
We were waiting to see
if Sonya's DNA

59:35.267 --> 59:36.964
was a match with
Heather Bradley's...

59:37.008 --> 59:38.836
Look, let's get
one thing straight.

59:38.879 --> 59:42.404
From this point forward, this is
an official police matter.

59:42.448 --> 59:43.841
Are we clear?

59:43.884 --> 59:44.972
Look.

59:45.016 --> 59:46.147
We both know
you're short-handed,

59:46.191 --> 59:47.322
let me help you.

59:47.366 --> 59:49.150
Any information I get
from here on in,

59:49.194 --> 59:50.195
I'll let you know.

59:50.238 --> 59:51.631
No more secrets.

59:51.675 --> 59:53.764
I want to solve this case
as badly as you do.

59:55.374 --> 59:56.549
Everything goes
through my department.

59:56.593 --> 59:57.376
Everything!

59:57.768 --> 59:58.159
Agreed?

59:58.203 --> 59:59.030
Yeah.

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:01.989
Sanchez.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.256
Had we gotten here any sooner,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.649
Rebecca might've
still been alive.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.259
Or we might both be dead.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.306
You can't blame
yourself for this.

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:16.525
We went to the lawyer
and now she's dead.

01:00:16.569 --> 01:00:18.440
I mean, it can't be
a coincidence.

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:20.660
Well, I didn't tell anybody
we were coming here.

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.183
Well maybe she told somebody.

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.751
I just heard back from
the officers I sent to Coyle's.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:26.753
Turns out he took a
vacation to Europe.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.625
We're working on finding
out where, exactly.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:29.538
So much for Florida.

01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:30.931
Yeah.

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:32.454
I'm also looking into
the whereabouts of Don,

01:00:32.498 --> 01:00:35.240
Olivia and Grayson Bradley...
see where they were today.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:38.025
I'm not gonna rule out
anyone at this point.

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.941
Whoever did this may
come after you too.

01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:43.509
So, I'm gonna station an
officer out front of your house,

01:00:43.552 --> 01:00:44.510
just to be safe.

01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:45.554
Yeah, good idea.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.742
Well, I'm coming over.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:00:59.960
No.

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:01.962
I don't want to
put you in any danger.

01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.921
But you're not
staying there by yourself.

01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:06.227
I'm not. There's an
officer out front.

01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:10.884
And Brandon offered
to stay over.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.712
Okay.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.888
Will you promise you'll call me
if you need anything, right?

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:15.846
I promise.

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.856
Thanks for offering
to stay over.

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:28.467
You know, I really hate that
I can't feel safe here.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:29.860
Yeah, no problem.

01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:34.952
Um, do you mind if I say grace?

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.867
Not at all, uh...

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:47.399
For food that stays our hunger,

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:49.662
for rest that brings us ease,

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.186
for homes where our
memories linger,

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.493
Lord, we give our thanks
for these.

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:55.929
Amen.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:01.761
What?

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:04.938
I'm just, uh, amazed that
with everything going on,

01:02:04.982 --> 01:02:07.506
you're still able to
maintain your faith.

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.508
Faith is all I've got left, now.

01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:12.206
My parents always made
a big deal of that, you know,

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.731
holding onto our faith when we
didn't know what to do.

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:18.909
So, what's your story?

01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:22.347
What do you mean?

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.784
Well, you told me you
grew up in a foster home,

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:27.047
but you never told me what
happened to your parents.

01:02:28.875 --> 01:02:30.224
Um...

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:35.926
You don't have to
tell me, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:38.972
No, no. It's okay.

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:41.888
Um...

01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:45.805
My mother had... she had
me when she was pretty young.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:49.461
My father... I guess
he wasn't really

01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:51.811
interested in sticking around.

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:53.900
So she raised me
'til I was about five,

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:56.076
but she liked to party.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.599
A lot.

01:02:57.643 --> 01:02:59.558
I guess one night somebody
called Child Services,

01:02:59.601 --> 01:03:01.995
they found me at home alone
and that was it.

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:04.868
From then on,
I was in foster care.

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:07.609
She used to come and
visit me a couple of times,

01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:11.788
but, uh, after a while
she stopped coming.

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:17.881
That must have been terrible
for you not having a family.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:20.318
You learn to deal with it.

01:03:20.361 --> 01:03:22.581
Did you ever see her again?

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:25.366
She called me about a year ago.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:30.328
Told me how sorry she was,
said she wanted to start over.

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.416
What'd you say?

01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:32.939
I said no.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.072
Of course.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.119
Look, she wasn't interested
in being part of my life then,

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:42.253
I'm not interested in
having her in my life now.

01:03:42.296 --> 01:03:44.951
Well you said she was
very young when she had you.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.780
Maybe she realized
what a mistake she made.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.608
Maybe she wants
to make it right.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:52.437
No, nothing she could do
could ever make it right.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.440
And it's not my responsibility
to absolve her of her guilt.

01:03:58.182 --> 01:04:02.360
I'm sorry, I... I know it's
not my business,

01:04:02.403 --> 01:04:06.277
but she could be
part of your life now.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.366
Why don't you try
to forgive her?

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:12.022
I wish it was as simple
for me as it is for you.

01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.197
It can be.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.024
Wow.

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:19.899
I wish I could see the
world the way you do.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:23.772
You're really special,
you know that?

01:04:23.816 --> 01:04:26.427
You really are.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.429
It's getting pretty late.

01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:31.911
I'm gonna grab you some
pillows and a blanket.

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:33.521
Okay.

01:04:33.565 --> 01:04:34.087
'Kay.

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:57.545
Officer Sanchez.

01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:58.416
Can I come in?

01:04:58.459 --> 01:04:59.852
Yeah.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.332
Thank you.

01:05:04.161 --> 01:05:06.250
Oh, hey.

01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.729
Don and Olivia's
alibis checked out,

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.383
just like I knew they would.

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:12.212
Olivia was at the gym at the
time Rebecca Gold got murdered

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.040
and Don was at a board meeting.

01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.824
I'm still trying to
track down Grayson,

01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.522
he's supposed to be
at a conference

01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:18.871
somewhere out of town.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.960
You came over here to
tell us that in person?

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:21.613
No.

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:25.965
Sonya, the DNA
results came back.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:30.578
Now, the DNA sample that we
have on file from Heather

01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:32.929
was over 20 years old.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:36.976
But it was still a 100% match.

01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:42.112
There's absolutely
no question...

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:43.678
you are Heather Bradley.

01:05:53.862 --> 01:05:55.125
I know this is a lot for you
the Bradleys. Get now. I

01:05:55.168 --> 01:05:57.214
Yeah, and we will,
but that can wait.

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:59.477
Right now, you just need
to take some time...

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:02.175
Don't you think they've
waited long enough?

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:05.352
Alright, uh,
I'll give them a call.

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.180
Set up a meeting.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:09.443
Yeah.

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:28.506
What was Don's reaction
when you called him?

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:30.116
I spoke with his assistant.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.989
I told her that we needed to
see him... that it was urgent.

01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:37.210
Hey, are you sure you
want to do this now?

01:06:37.254 --> 01:06:38.864
Here?

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:41.780
I just want to get it over
with as soon as possible.

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:42.868
Alright.

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:47.003
Get down!

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:56.490
Ah!

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:57.013
Brandon!

01:06:58.362 --> 01:06:59.232
You're hurt!

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:02.322
I'm alright.

01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:04.107
Stay here!

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:14.204
We heard shots.
Are you okay?

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:15.857
Yeah.

01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:17.076
Did you see the shooter?

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.773
No.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:21.080
While we wait for the
police, come inside, please.

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:27.913
Just wait in my office.

01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:31.395
So you're telling me
that someone was trying to

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:33.527
prevent Sonya from
figuring out if she was Heather?

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.963
Yeah.

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.530
We think it was the same
person who broke into

01:07:36.574 --> 01:07:38.184
Sonya's mother's place
a few days ago.

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:39.838
Why would they do that?

01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:43.320
I think they were trying to look
for the birth certificate.

01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.713
Did you tell anybody we were
coming here today?

01:07:45.757 --> 01:07:47.063
No, no. Of course not.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:48.586
This is a private family matter.

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:51.241
Whoever shot at us it is
probably the same person

01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:53.765
who killed Sonya's mother
and Rebecca Gold.

01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:54.853
Heather's nanny?

01:07:54.896 --> 01:07:57.073
Yeah, she was killed yesterday.

01:07:58.161 --> 01:07:59.988
What?!

01:08:00.032 --> 01:08:03.296
We were supposed to meet with
her... somebody got to her first.

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.212
My, uh, secretary told me you
wanted to see me about

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:08.519
something important, but I
didn't realize it was Rebecca.

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.173
No, that's not why we came.

01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:17.354
Sonya's DNA test results
came back yesterday.

01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:21.184
It's a perfect match
with your daughter.

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:36.460
I don't know what to say...

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:38.417
We were able to
find the attorney

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:39.593
who handled Sonya's adoption.

01:08:39.636 --> 01:08:40.768
Sonya's mother contacted him

01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:42.901
after she found
the birth certificate.

01:08:42.944 --> 01:08:45.859
Turns out he's connected
to Rebecca Gold.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:48.471
Now she's dead and he
skipped the country.

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:49.515
No, that's not possible.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.344
Rebecca was like family.

01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:53.216
She would never have done
that to us.

01:08:54.086 --> 01:08:56.219
I have to take this.

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:57.176
Brandon Hayes.

01:09:01.746 --> 01:09:04.923
This is all so overwhelming.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:08.144
And my wife, I...

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:11.147
I hope you understand,

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.714
I need to try to find
a way to tell her.

01:09:15.412 --> 01:09:19.764
I'm just not sure my wife is
emotionally strong enough

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.591
to deal with this right now.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.768
I understand.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.688
How insensitive of me.

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:32.907
This must be very
difficult for you as well,

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:35.345
having just lost your mother.

01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:38.216
It's just, I worry
about my wife.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.611
After all these years and
all the disappointments, it's...

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.002
That was Hector.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:43.875
He spotted a car on Parkway West

01:09:43.917 --> 01:09:46.573
that matches the description
of the one that shot at us.

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:49.054
We really need to
get you to the hospital.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:50.795
No. I'm fine.
It's just a graze.

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.752
We don't have time
for that right now.

01:09:52.796 --> 01:09:54.799
At least let me check it out.

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:56.235
Okay.

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:57.715
Thank you, Don.

01:10:01.936 --> 01:10:02.720
Thank you.

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:05.375
I'll be in touch.

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.857
This is pretty deep.

01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:11.685
We should have got
you to the hospital.

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.513
Ah, no.

01:10:13.557 --> 01:10:16.124
You shouldn't be out there 'til
we figure out who's doing this.

01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:18.039
Brandon, I would
never forgive myself

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:19.911
if anything happened
to you because of me.

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:21.347
No, no, no.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:23.349
Don't worry about me.

01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:26.134
I'm alright, how are
you holding up?

01:10:26.178 --> 01:10:28.354
I don't know how
to feel right now.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:37.929
It's my tech guy about the
crest on the security footage.

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.804
I'm sorry I lied to you before.

01:10:43.848 --> 01:10:47.199
I just wanted to wait
until we were certain.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.114
I want to hear it from her.

01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:51.203
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.119
Why don't you
want me to see her?

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:56.600
Why don't you want me
to do anything?

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:04.869
I've seen this symbol before.

01:11:05.565 --> 01:11:06.436
Where?

01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:12.964
Stay away from us or
you're going to regret it!

01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:14.400
This crest was on
Grayson's sweatshirt

01:11:14.444 --> 01:11:15.793
when he came to see me.

01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:16.750
Come on.

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:17.795
Well, we gotta call Hector.

01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:19.318
We'll call him on the way.

01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:28.327
Olivia?

01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:30.198
Dear?

01:11:33.898 --> 01:11:36.292
I'm sorry I upset you earlier.

01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:41.166
I need to go back to
the office for a bit.

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:42.123
I won't be long.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:45.779
I love you.

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:07.279
Grayson, it's your father.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.672
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:09.542
It's important.

01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:11.152
I need to talk to you.

01:12:20.031 --> 01:12:22.816
You are not gonna
stop me this time.

01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:31.956
I think that's

01:12:31.999 --> 01:12:33.218
He used to work here.

01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.568
Used to?

01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:38.354
Got let go after he got
into a fight with a client.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.704
That kind of nasty temper
doesn't fly around here.

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:43.402
Do you know if Buddy was
Grayson Bradley's trainer?

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.361
Yeah, I believe he was.

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:48.102
Thank you.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.544
I need you to run a registration
on that car right away.

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:55.936
Sanchez.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.503
Yeah, it's Hayes.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:59.418
I think the guy that broke into
Sonya's mother's house

01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:00.985
is a guy named Buddy Reed.

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.378
A personal trainer
for Grayson Bradley.

01:13:02.421 --> 01:13:04.031
Why do you think that?

01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:07.034
Well, one of the trainers at the
gym ID'd him from a photo

01:13:07.078 --> 01:13:09.472
we enhanced from Sonya's
neighbor's security camera.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.516
Oh, yeah.

01:13:14.868 --> 01:13:17.567
I... I don't think Buddy's going
to be talking any time soon.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.394
Whaddya mean?

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:21.005
He's dead.

01:13:21.048 --> 01:13:23.137
He just rolled his car in
that high-speed chase.

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:24.617
Buddy Reed is dead.

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:26.358
'Kay, listen.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.316
I think Buddy Reed was hired by
Grayson Bradley to prevent

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.841
Sonya from proving that she
is Heather Bradley.

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:33.583
What you need to do is
bring him in for questioning.

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.541
Better yet, issue a
warrant for his arrest.

01:13:35.585 --> 01:13:37.369
No go.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.066
Grayson Bradley was speaking
at a conference out of town.

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:41.329
He's got an airtight alibi with
about a hundred witnesses.

01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:43.375
That doesn't mean he couldn't
have hired Buddy Reed.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.463
Yeah, look.

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:45.725
I'm... I'm not haulinng in the son

01:13:45.769 --> 01:13:47.858
of the richest family
in town on a hunch.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:48.815
Come on Hector!

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:50.295
No, sorry.

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:51.644
I'm gonna need more than that.

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:52.210
Fine.

01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:53.472
What?

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:58.434
Listen, with Buddy Reed dead,
we're not gonna be able

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.348
to prove that he was
working with Grayson.

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:01.828
So what are we gonna do?

01:14:01.872 --> 01:14:03.308
We're gonna head to the office.

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.049
Take a look at a few things.

01:14:05.092 --> 01:14:06.006
I'm coming with you.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.964
No, no, no.

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.661
The safest place for you to be

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:10.576
is at your mother's house
with police surveillance.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.969
I'll drop you on the way.

01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:26.244
There has to be
something here...

01:14:28.942 --> 01:14:33.164
Mark Green, CEO of Mitchell
Strategic Engineering, dies.

01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:37.124
Olivia Bradley set
to take over as CEO.

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:43.479
Olivia Bradley.

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:47.352
Attacked Rebecca Gold,

01:14:47.395 --> 01:14:49.049
diagnosed with Paranoid
Personality Disorder.

01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:56.753
Alright.

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:57.971
I'll take it from here.

01:15:17.208 --> 01:15:18.731
Thank you.

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:19.689
Brandon...

01:15:19.732 --> 01:15:20.864
You have more news?

01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:23.475
Yeah, I was hoping you could,
uh...

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.781
Clarify something for me.

01:15:24.824 --> 01:15:25.651
Yeah, what's that?

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:31.004
Is it true Olivia
was institutionalized

01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:33.050
after Heather's disappearance?

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:38.577
You can imagine how
hard it is for a mother

01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:39.839
who's lost her child.

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:42.799
She attacked Rebecca Gold.

01:15:42.842 --> 01:15:46.367
My wife became convinced that
Rebecca knew what happened

01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:49.327
to Heather, and that
she was lying to her.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.678
The truth is, Olivia was just
not herself for a long time

01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:56.203
after Heather disappeared, and
in many ways she still isn't.

01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:57.901
What if Janet Daniels
contacted your wife

01:15:57.944 --> 01:15:59.511
after she found
the birth certificate?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.991
What are you implying?

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.601
My wife would never hurt anyone.

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:05.604
You just said she was
institutionalized for just that.

01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:06.692
Yes, but that's different.

01:16:06.736 --> 01:16:08.476
She... she just lost a baby.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.610
What if your wife thought
Janet was lying?

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:13.090
Just like Rebecca was.

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:19.357
Did you tell your wife
about the DNA results?

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.576
Of course I did, but...

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:21.315
But what?

01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:23.970
I don't think she believed me.

01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:28.105
Mr. Bradley, where is
your wife right now?

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:30.020
Oh, this is ridiculous.

01:16:37.462 --> 01:16:39.943
Mrs. Bradley.

01:16:39.986 --> 01:16:41.509
Uh... please come in.

01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:48.865
Can I offer you
something to drink?

01:16:48.908 --> 01:16:51.519
Um... coffee, or tea?

01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:54.000
Um... tea would
be lovely.

01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:55.567
I'll just get the kettle going.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.525
Uh, please, have a seat.

01:16:57.569 --> 01:16:58.396
Thank you.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.850
You've reached Sonya Daniels,

01:18:00.893 --> 01:18:02.590
please leave a message
after the beep.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:05.071
Sonya, it's me, Brandon,
call me as soon as possible,

01:18:05.115 --> 01:18:07.291
I think we've been looking
at the wrong Bradley.

01:18:07.334 --> 01:18:09.032
I'll tell you when I see you.

01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:10.250
Just... stay in
your house, alright?

01:18:10.294 --> 01:18:11.382
Do not leave your house!

01:18:13.558 --> 01:18:15.865
So I guess Don told you
about the DNA results?

01:18:15.908 --> 01:18:16.909
Yes.

01:18:17.954 --> 01:18:19.651
That's why I'm here.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.784
Well, I'm glad you came,
I-I wasn't sure...

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:24.395
It's just so hard
to know what's true.

01:18:28.442 --> 01:18:29.879
There's something
you need to know.

01:18:31.663 --> 01:18:34.535
It's just... very...

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.800
Complicated.

01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.812
Would you excuse me a minute?

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.643
Come on, Hector,
pick up, pick up!

01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:09.614
Mrs. Bradley?

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:39.644
9-1-1...

01:19:39.687 --> 01:19:41.080
Yeah, officer down,
I need backup!

01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:44.867
Hang in there, buddy,
I got help on the way.

01:19:48.522 --> 01:19:49.480
Sonya!

01:20:22.774 --> 01:20:23.862
Why are you doing this?

01:20:27.213 --> 01:20:30.695
Looks like it's all been
a little too much for my wife.

01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:32.044
Isn't that right, Olivia?

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.481
It's you.

01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:42.794
I need you to put out an
APB on Olivia Bradley's car.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:45.971
I have reason to believe
she's abducted Sonia Daniels.

01:20:47.799 --> 01:20:50.976
I don't understand...
why would you do this?

01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:55.067
Everything was fine
until your mother

01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:56.373
found that birth certificate.

01:21:03.249 --> 01:21:05.512
Why'd you have to leave it
in the diaper bag?

01:21:07.732 --> 01:21:10.517
And why'd Rebecca
have to be so stupid?

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:15.827
As to hand the bag over to the
attorney along with the baby.

01:21:16.436 --> 01:21:18.917
You hired Buddy Reed
to kill my mother?

01:21:18.961 --> 01:21:21.659
After she found
the birth certificate,

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:24.227
I called the attorney
she'd adopted you from.

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:26.403
He called me in a panic.

01:21:26.446 --> 01:21:28.492
I couldn't have your mother
going to the police.

01:21:29.449 --> 01:21:31.843
Ruining everything I'd
worked for all these years?

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.586
What kind of sick
person are you?

01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:39.285
You arranged to have
your daughter stolen?

01:21:39.329 --> 01:21:40.504
That's just the point.

01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:44.638
You are not my daughter.

01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:53.821
Did you really think all
these years that I didn't know?

01:21:53.865 --> 01:21:56.737
My wife thought that I
married her for her money.

01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:01.133
So she had an affair with
her childhood sweetheart.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.008
The man from the
photograph in your house?

01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:08.662
She got pregnant.

01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:11.274
She was gonna leave me.

01:22:12.188 --> 01:22:15.191
I couldn't let her take
everything away from me.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.717
So Mark had to have a...

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.805
Little accident.

01:22:22.502 --> 01:22:23.982
Mark?

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:25.375
You killed Mark?

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:28.813
I paid Rebecca Gold to
take you from church,

01:22:28.856 --> 01:22:32.686
and sell you to the
adoption attorney.

01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:35.167
But you told me the DNA
results were negative,

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:37.474
that... she wasn't my daughter.

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:40.694
I told you what
you wanted to hear,

01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:43.088
but she was a liar,
just like all the others.

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:58.625
Did you actually think I'd let
you keep that bastard's baby?

01:22:58.669 --> 01:23:00.062
Don't you hurt her!

01:23:13.466 --> 01:23:15.164
Let me go.

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:16.948
Afraid I can't do that.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.995
Not when I'm about to
take the company public.

01:23:20.038 --> 01:23:22.693
Its such a shame what's happened
to poor Olivia Bradley.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:26.088
Everyone will believe that
she was driven to madness

01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:29.395
by all these imposters, and ends
up killing her daughter,

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.007
and then herself.

01:23:34.313 --> 01:23:36.533
If only you could've just
left things alone.

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:36.968
No!

01:23:52.201 --> 01:23:53.071
Freeze!

01:23:53.115 --> 01:23:53.941
Drop the gun!

01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:55.726
Don't shoot.

01:23:55.769 --> 01:23:57.075
It was him.

01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:57.989
It was Don.

01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:01.297
I'm so sorry.

01:24:03.342 --> 01:24:04.126
So sorry.

01:24:15.789 --> 01:24:17.748
I'm really glad
you decided to stay

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:20.794
and keep your mama's house,
she'd be so proud.

01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:22.883
And they let you
transfer your residency.

01:24:22.927 --> 01:24:26.713
Yeah, um, well, there's some
extenuating circumstances.

01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:30.543
Sonya's got some company.

01:24:32.154 --> 01:24:34.591
Come on, I made a new batch
of my famous chicken

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:35.983
just last night.

01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:38.595
Those are the magic words.

01:24:44.818 --> 01:24:46.037
Now, do you want biscuits...

01:24:50.563 --> 01:24:52.739
Oh, I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:54.219
Yeah, I got back last night.

01:24:54.263 --> 01:24:56.308
So, how did it go
with your mother?

01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:59.529
It was good, we agreed to
take things one day at a time.

01:24:59.572 --> 01:25:01.487
So how's Olivia,
have you seen her?

01:25:01.531 --> 01:25:03.794
Yeah, she's getting stronger
everyday now that she's

01:25:03.837 --> 01:25:06.318
not on the pills Don
convinced her she needed.

01:25:06.362 --> 01:25:07.885
And Grayson?

01:25:07.928 --> 01:25:10.453
It's tough for him, but I think
he's coming around.

01:25:10.496 --> 01:25:13.282
I guess God gave us both
a second chance, huh?

01:25:13.325 --> 01:25:15.719
Looks like he really did.

01:25:15.762 --> 01:25:18.548
And speaking of second chances,
I had a question for you.

01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.202
What's that?

01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:23.640
Now that this is all over,
um, do you think we could...

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:25.468
try that kiss again?

01:25:57.195 --> 01:26:02.635
Thank you for taking such
good care of our little girl.
