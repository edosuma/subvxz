00:13.680 --> 00:15.347
Jackass!

01:01.462 --> 01:03.495
Aah! Ow! God!

01:03.497 --> 01:05.096
Everything okay, mr. C.?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.565
Does everything look okay, pi?!

01:06.567 --> 01:09.101
Uh, I don't know.
It's kinda dark in here.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.837
Dad? Wh-what's going on?
What happened?

01:11.839 --> 01:14.840
My office. Now.

01:23.216 --> 01:26.652
I've tried to be generous
and understanding.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.121
I have tried
to be tolerant.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.756
But, alexis, it's been
over a month,

01:30.758 --> 01:32.357
And pi is still here.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.625
I know, dad.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.527
And he feels bad about it.
We both do.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.229
I don't care
if he feels bad.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.597
I want my couch back.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.200
I want my house back.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.136
You go back to college
next week. What then?

01:44.138 --> 01:47.339
Sweetheart, he has to go.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.108
You're absolutely right.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.476
He's been here way too long.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.810
It's not right,
and it's not fair to you.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.712
thank you.

01:53.714 --> 01:57.149
And the best news is,
I think we found a place.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.284
Honey, that is so great.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.221
<i>Did you say
"we found a place"?</i>

02:02.223 --> 02:03.889
Yeah. Pi and I
talked it over.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.657
He can't afford a place
on his own,

02:05.659 --> 02:07.259
So we found one together.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.261
Together?
Yeah.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.130
That way, the rent's
totally affordable.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.198
I can cover my half
with a work-study job,

02:13.200 --> 02:15.234
And it's right
next to school.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.368
Plus it'll save you
having to pay

02:16.370 --> 02:18.270
For university housing
this year.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.405
You don't honestly think
I'm gonna let you

02:20.407 --> 02:21.673
Do this, do you?

02:21.675 --> 02:25.144
Let me? Dad, I'm 19.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.714
Far too young to be
moving in with someone.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.716
Really? Because I was
old enough to sign the lease.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.851
And weren't you living
with your girlfriend

02:32.853 --> 02:35.821
- When you were 19?
- Yes. But that was different.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.489
How?

02:39.859 --> 02:43.162
Trust me, dad.
We've thought this through.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.197
It makes total sense.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.766
In what universe
does that make sense?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.334
I'll tell you what universe...
the one where

02:49.336 --> 02:50.903
She's blinded by emotion
and not thinking straight.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.672
It's like watching
a car accident in slow motion.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.874
You know, castle,
my dad wanted to kill

02:55.876 --> 02:58.277
The first guy
that I moved in with.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.779
He did everything he could
to try and talk me out of it,

03:00.781 --> 03:03.182
And all that did was make me
want to do it even more.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.217
I wish her future self
would come back

03:05.219 --> 03:07.920
Let her know what a mistake
she's making,

03:07.922 --> 03:10.589
Save her from a...

03:10.591 --> 03:12.291
A world of hurt.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.929
A lot of weirdos out there
with too much imagination

03:16.931 --> 03:18.330
Is what happened.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.465
And, yes, I'm looking
at you, castle.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.267
Yeah, except I only
commit my murders on paper.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.969
I don't actually do them.
A lot more lucrative,

03:23.971 --> 03:25.437
A lot less prison.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.939
So was she electrocuted?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.274
Yeah, but that's not
the cause of death.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.510
Her throat was cut.
And the rest of this,

03:31.512 --> 03:33.845
If I had to guess,
I'd say she was tortured.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.947
why? Who is she?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.782
Shauna taylor, 34.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.951
She's a parole office with
the department of corrections.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.286
Could be one of her parolees
out for revenge.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.988
How did he get in?
Right now it's a mystery.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.923
There's no sign of forced entry,
and from the look of it,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.459
She wasn't expecting trouble.
How can you tell that?

03:47.461 --> 03:50.295
She had a carry permit
for a sig.9.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.598
Do we know
when this happened?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.899
I won't have anything definitive

03:53.901 --> 03:55.434
Until I get her back
to the office.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.969
neighbors
didn't hear anything,

03:56.971 --> 03:58.737
Probably because
she was gagged.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.439
But the guy who called it in
said that he saw

04:00.441 --> 04:02.474
A guy leaving the apartment
around 5:30 a. M.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.009
Said the dude had
fresh blood on him.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.511
Ryan's got our witness
with the sketch artist now.

04:06.513 --> 04:12.284
We're also gonna need alibis
for all of them from last night.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.255
What do we know about
her family?

04:16.257 --> 04:18.991
she's dead?

04:18.993 --> 04:20.759
I knew it!

04:20.761 --> 04:22.527
I knew something like this
would happen.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.296
I warned her, didn't I?

04:24.298 --> 04:28.033
She loved helping people get
their lives back on track.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.403
Dr. Wickfield, were you
and your stepsister close?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.538
Not really.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.040
The two of us had
very different lives.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.977
Since our father passed,
we made an effort,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.879
Called each other once,
maybe twice a month.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.350
Did she say anything that would
indicate she was in trouble?

04:45.352 --> 04:48.453
Yeah. When we... we talked
about a week ago.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.922
She said she thought someone
might be stalking her.

04:50.924 --> 04:55.027
She kept seeing this guy
wherever she went, watching her.

04:55.029 --> 04:56.728
One of her parolees?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.731
No. She said she didn't
recognize him.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.068
I thought maybe she was
just being paranoid.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.570
So according
to shauna's supervisor,

05:05.572 --> 05:07.973
All of her parolees were
nonviolent offenders,

05:07.975 --> 05:10.475
And none of them looked
like this sketch

05:10.477 --> 05:12.744
That we took off the neighbor

05:12.746 --> 05:15.580
Or match prints that c. S. U.
Got from the crime scene.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.717
So it's quite possible this
had nothing to do with her job?

05:18.719 --> 05:21.453
Then why torture her?
What could the killer want?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.888
What, castle,
no crazy theories?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.456
Oh, he's got bigger issues.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.059
His daughter's moving in
with a boy.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.061
And you're letting her?

05:29.063 --> 05:32.097
Well, apparently the only way
to stop her is locking her up,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.066
But according
to miss by-the-book here,

05:34.068 --> 05:35.667
That's unlawful imprisonment.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.903
Hey. Caught a break
on that stalker.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.004
Couple nights ago,
shauna filed

05:39.006 --> 05:42.441
Apparently, three days ago,
a guy confronted shauna

05:42.443 --> 05:44.109
On her way home
from work.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.944
Said the lives of half
the people on the planet

05:45.946 --> 05:48.814
Whatever crazy theory
I could have come up with,

05:48.816 --> 05:52.417
She managed to get away
and duck inside her building,

05:52.419 --> 05:55.954
He was still out there waiting
for her, so she called the cops.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.458
He didn't have an I. D. And he
was pretty much off his rocker,

05:59.460 --> 06:01.093
So they put him
on a 72-hour psych hold.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.761
He was released
early this morning.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.365
They were never able
to I. D. Him, but check it out.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.737
Get over to the psych ward.
Pull his records.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.505
We need to find out
who he is.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.675
<i>You do not understand.
We are running out of time.</i>

06:16.677 --> 06:19.644
<i>I need to get out of here.
You have to let me go!</i>

06:19.646 --> 06:22.581
<i>Why do you feel you need to go?
Come on, I told you!</i>

06:22.583 --> 06:24.649
<i>I... she is in danger!
Who is in danger?</i>

06:24.651 --> 06:27.486
<i>You're not even listening
to me! Shauna taylor!</i>

06:27.488 --> 06:32.057
<i>All I know is 12-58.
That is all they told me, okay?</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:34.860
<i>That is how is starts, and if
I am not there to stop it,</i>

06:34.862 --> 06:36.561
<i>We are all dead!</i>

06:36.563 --> 06:38.130
<i>Do you understand me? Dead!</i>

06:38.132 --> 06:39.965
<i>You...</i>

06:39.967 --> 06:41.800
<i>Somebody has to let me
out of here!</i>

06:41.802 --> 06:44.136
<i>All right, listen to me!
I need to save her!</i>

06:44.138 --> 06:46.171
Do you think by "save,"
he meant kill?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.673
Because it sounds to me like he
really didn't want her to die.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.008
He's mentally ill.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.443
He may not know
the difference.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.944
12-58... what do you think
that means?

06:52.946 --> 06:55.881
Time. Address.
Bible verse.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.716
Or maybe it's...

06:57.718 --> 06:59.584
Random numbers
from a disturbed mind.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.889
Either way,
we got to find him.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.858
The guy's a john doe.
He's got no I. D., no address.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.860
Could be homeless.
Where do we even start?

07:08.862 --> 07:13.098
To every hospital, precinct,
and psych ward in the city.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.066
I'll send out his pictures
to shelters

07:15.068 --> 07:16.668
And soup kitchens,
see if we can get lucky.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.069
I think we just did.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.171
That was
our victim's neighbor.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.705
He just saw our john doe

07:20.707 --> 07:23.041
Breaking back into
shauna's apartment.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.087
n. Y. P. D.!
show us your hands right now!

07:36.089 --> 07:37.756
No!

07:37.758 --> 07:39.624
Uhh!

07:39.626 --> 07:42.194
No, no, no! Let me go! You don't
know what you're doing!

07:42.196 --> 07:44.062
We know exactly what
we're doing.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.831
Please listen to me.
Don't do this. Please.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.065
You have to let me go.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.834
If you don't,
a billion people will die.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.836
Yeah? How they gonna die?
I don't know.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.170
I only know that they do.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.839
Yeah? How's that?

07:53.841 --> 07:56.808
Because... I'm from the future.

08:00.413 --> 08:03.548
this just
became my favorite case.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.990
So... Future, huh?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.658
That's right.
Okay.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.927
So why don't we just start
with something simple,

08:15.929 --> 08:17.195
Like your name?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.797
Why does everybody
wanna know my name?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.031
And who cares?
It doesn't matter.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.233
Humor me.
Fine.

08:21.235 --> 08:25.036
You can call me... Simon.
Simon... Doyle.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.671
And what year are you from,
exactly?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.173
2035.
Castle.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.774
Don't tell me
you weren't wondering.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.877
No, what I was
actually wondering was

08:31.879 --> 08:34.011
What were you doing
in shauna taylor's apartment?

08:34.014 --> 08:37.249
Same thing you were, I expect.
Looking for her killer.

08:37.251 --> 08:40.150
Except all the evidence
points to you.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.188
Detective, it was my job
to prevent her murder.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.224
Ipso facto, q. E. D.,
I am not her killer.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.160
Point, in fact, she was never
even supposed to die.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.762
Okay? But because she has,

08:50.764 --> 08:52.597
A chain of events has started,
that if I do not stop...

08:52.599 --> 08:53.698
Billions of people will die?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.001
That's exactly right.
Look...

08:56.003 --> 08:58.670
After the bloody energy wars
of 2031,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.272
We'd finally managed to
cultivate new sources of power.

09:00.274 --> 09:01.840
Energy wars?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.008
Yeah, neo-fascists
come to power,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.677
Try to control
the world's energy supply

09:05.679 --> 09:08.313
For a select few,
but don't worry. We defeat them.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.815
Turns out that one of
these new sources of power

09:10.817 --> 09:12.284
Is a tachyon generator.
It...

09:12.286 --> 09:14.686
Lets us open doors
in the time stream continuum,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.288
Allowing us to travel
back in time.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.156
But, of course, because of
the possibility of abuse,

09:18.158 --> 09:20.592
It was tightly regulated
and kept secret from the public.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.193
We have a witness
that saw you

09:22.195 --> 09:23.995
Leaving
shauna taylor's apartment

09:23.997 --> 09:25.931
Shortly after she was killed.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.233
I'm getting to that. Look. Look,
I'm a temporal anthropologist.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.135
What we do is we travel
back in time

09:30.137 --> 09:32.804
And we... and we study
culturally significant eras...

09:32.806 --> 09:35.307
Ancient egypt, middle ages.
Man, I've been to nazi germany.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.309
Aren't you worried
about the butterfly effect?

09:37.311 --> 09:39.644
Accidentally changing something
in the past,

09:39.646 --> 09:40.912
Thus altering the future?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.281
No. We're careful.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.950
The time stream is mostly
self-correcting, okay?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.318
Any small change is like
a little ripple

09:46.320 --> 09:49.854
But if someone was to do
something big,

09:49.856 --> 09:51.756
If somebody was
to do something massive,

09:51.758 --> 09:53.325
Then, yes, of course, damn right
you can change the future,

09:53.327 --> 09:56.194
And by the way, that's exactly
what just happened.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.862
Somebody broke into our lab,
okay?

09:57.864 --> 10:00.298
Made an unauthorized jump
back in time. We don't know who.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.601
But when they did, the numbers...
they started to spike.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.603
Now I'm like a tide
going out before a tsunami.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.805
And what happens
when the tsunami hits?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.640
Well, it hasn't caught up to us
yet, okay, but when it does,

10:08.642 --> 10:11.810
Whatever chain of events that
has just started now will result

10:11.812 --> 10:13.712
<i>In billions of deaths
that did not otherwise occur.</i>

10:13.714 --> 10:15.113
You understand me?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.950
Okay. Um, mr. Doyle,
let's say that you are indeed

10:18.952 --> 10:21.853
From the future...

10:21.855 --> 10:23.254
How did shauna taylor
fit into all of this?

10:23.256 --> 10:26.858
I mean, how does her death
change things so radically?

10:26.860 --> 10:30.295
I don't know.
All I know is that

10:30.297 --> 10:33.031
We traced the first change in
the timeline to her apartment,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.100
October 7th, 12:58 a. M.

10:35.102 --> 10:39.204
Which is why they sent you back,
why you accosted her...

10:39.206 --> 10:41.139
To stop that first event.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.875
And I failed, okay?
And now she's dead.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.343
But this is why I was
searching her apartment...

10:45.345 --> 10:46.845
To find out
why she was targeted,

10:46.847 --> 10:48.146
Why this person
would torture her.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.649
There's a reason he came
back in time to find her.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.317
She had something he needed.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.353
I don't know what. Some piece
of information. Doesn't matter.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.222
What matters is that
I get out of here, okay?

10:57.224 --> 10:58.390
Because it is not too late.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.392
I can still stop this.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.761
but you have to
let me go now, okay?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.996
I only have a few hours
before they recall me.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.231
You're gonna be delayed.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.033
oh, no.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.368
recall you?

11:10.370 --> 11:13.038
This is painful.
No, man. I'm talking to people

11:13.040 --> 11:15.106
Who still think
the earth is flat.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.174
Hey.
Hey.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.076
His fingerprints are a match

11:18.078 --> 11:20.311
For the ones we pulled
from the crime scene.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.913
No question he's our guy.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.215
Yeah. No kidding.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.251
You're making a huge mistake!
castle.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.887
<i>Yeah?
For the sake of our future,</i>

11:28.889 --> 11:31.089
Please tell me you don't
believe that guy.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.192
- Oh, no. But you got to admit,
it's a great story. - Really?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.327
Uh, thought
it was kinda derivative.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.898
- Yeah, like a mash-up of
"12 monkeys" and "terminator." - Mm.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.368
Yeah, but it's the way
he told it... total commitment.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.003
Commitment that turned deadly.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.738
I mean,
to maintain his delusion,

11:46.740 --> 11:50.175
Shauna had to die. He might not
even know that he killed her.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.910
Hey, did you guys find out
what this device was

11:51.912 --> 11:54.846
Tech said it's just a bunch
of junk thrown together.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.314
What were you expecting, castle?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.417
Time travel device?
Doctor who's sonic screwdriver?

11:59.419 --> 12:00.852
You watch "doctor who"?

12:02.089 --> 12:03.822
Oh, that's lanie.
Okay, we'll hit the morgue.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.457
Why don't you guys time travel
over to your desks

12:05.459 --> 12:08.393
And let the d. A. Know
that we've got our killer?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.795
He's not your killer.

12:10.797 --> 12:15.300
<i>I mean time of death was
between midnight and 2:00 a. M.</i>

12:15.302 --> 12:18.369
Doyle wasn't released from
psychiatric hold until 4:00 a. M.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.106
It can't be him.
No, it has to be him.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.109
He was stalking her,
and he was at the crime scene.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.745
Yeah... Hours after
she was dead.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.447
<i>In fact, time of death
is probably closer to 1:00 a. M.</i>

12:29.449 --> 12:31.483
How can you tell that?
Her watch.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.318
it stopped at 12:58,

12:33.320 --> 12:35.120
Probably from one of
the electric shocks.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.521
May I?
12:58.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.156
did you just get a chill?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.258
No, castle, I didn't
just get a chill.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.260
Do you wanna know why?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.828
Because doyle was
at that crime scene,

12:43.830 --> 12:46.765
And he had plenty of time
to change her watch

12:46.767 --> 12:51.269
And just because he wasn't there
when she was being murdered,

12:51.271 --> 12:53.304
It doesn't mean
he's not involved somehow.

12:53.306 --> 12:58.042
Shauna was with someone
the night she was killed.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.712
Once I cleaned the blood
from the body,

13:00.714 --> 13:03.081
<i>I saw these...</i>

13:03.083 --> 13:04.349
On her neck.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.021
Is that lipstick?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.389
mm-hmm.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.092
She was with a woman.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.227
You guys,
shauna's stepbrother confirms

13:16.229 --> 13:19.998
She was gay, but he's sure
she wasn't seeing someone.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.232
There's nothing
in her phone records

13:21.234 --> 13:25.370
However, I did find
a charge to her credit card

13:25.372 --> 13:26.905
For the night
that she died.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.273
georgia's bar.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.408
It's right around the corner
from her apartment.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.010
Looks like she was buying
for two.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.211
Could be our killer.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.379
Okay,
you guys get over there,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.047
See if she was seen
with anyone

13:36.049 --> 13:37.382
Or noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.817
I will call the d. A.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.186
If we can't charge doyle
with murder...

13:41.188 --> 13:42.554
maybe I can get him held

13:42.556 --> 13:44.389
With a departmental
psych eval

13:44.391 --> 13:46.291
Until we have some answers.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.460
Yeah, shauna was here.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.396
Why? Did something
happen to her?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.498
Was she with anyone
that night?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.133
Yeah. It was odd.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.235
The chick she was hanging with
was a pro.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.570
You mean, like, a hooker?
Yeah.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.005
I bartend weekends
down at the standish.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.240
Chick's a regular
in their lounge

14:02.242 --> 14:04.008
Targeting upscale men.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.310
You ever seen her
down here before?

14:05.312 --> 14:06.945
Unh-unh.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.246
I don't know if she was
working or what,

14:08.248 --> 14:10.281
But she and shauna
seemed pretty cozy.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.283
They left together.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.585
You know her name?

14:13.587 --> 14:16.187
Veronica.
Go up to the standish.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.555
She'll be hard to miss.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.424
your witnesses
are confused.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.126
I don't go to georgia's.
Not my scene.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.895
Well, we have security
camera footage

14:23.897 --> 14:26.297
That shows the two of you
leaving there together.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.465
Wanna try again?

14:28.634 --> 14:31.436
Okay. I left with her.
I like a little variety.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.137
And what happened
after you left the bar?

14:33.139 --> 14:36.007
Did you go to her place?
How is that your business?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.375
Because...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.077
She's dead.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.080
killed in her apartment
last night.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.349
we found lipstick marks
on her neck.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.251
When we test 'em, whose d. N. A.
Do you think we're gonna find?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.419
this wasn't me.
I didn't do this.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.654
You were with her
that night.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.256
But only because I was
paid to be.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.925
- By who?
- Some guy. He hired me to come on to her.

14:53.927 --> 14:57.662
- Why?
- He wanted me to get in her place and steal her keys.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.330
I- I didn't know he was
gonna kill her.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.832
Is this the guy?

15:00.834 --> 15:05.069
No. This guy was
way more intense, scary.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.071
- Who is he?
- I don't know. I didn't want to know.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.140
I just did what I had to
and I got out of there.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.276
If you didn't know him,
why'd you agree to take the job?

15:11.278 --> 15:14.212
Because I had no choice.
Mick, my manager, said I had to.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.414
He said this guy was
a friend of his.

15:17.316 --> 15:20.351
<i>so if we are gonna
find the scary guy,</i>

15:20.353 --> 15:22.520
Shouldn't we be tracking down
this manager?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.989
Don't have to. We had
veronica call him and tell him

15:24.991 --> 15:26.391
She's been busted
for solicitation.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.027
He thinks he's coming in
to bail her out.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.495
So... How's
our time traveler?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.230
Well, he's still sticking
to his story.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.332
Keeps checking his watch, saying
he's about to be recalled.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.466
Hmm. Well, it's not
a total waste.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.602
I did get some
excellent stock tips.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.570
Well, don't invest
just yet.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.472
Once we find out
who hired veronica,

15:41.474 --> 15:43.942
Then we'll know
how doyle's involved.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.443
Detective beckett?
Dr. Silverman,

15:45.445 --> 15:47.445
Here for psych eval
on simon doyle.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.281
He's right back there.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.554
Right back where?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.998
Where is he?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.399
Where did he go?

16:08.401 --> 16:10.301
Not where.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.103
When.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.678
And he really was
recalled back to the future?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.047
He wasn't recalled
back to the future.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.049
And do you know
how I know that?

16:25.051 --> 16:27.585
Because he's not
a time traveler.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.121
Okay. So where is he?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.389
Simple explanation?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.124
There was a mix-up
with the paperwork

16:33.126 --> 16:35.426
When his charges
were dropped,

16:35.428 --> 16:37.295
And some desk monkey
accidentally let him go,

16:37.297 --> 16:40.064
And now they are all trying
to cover their asses.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.099
That's reasonable.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.735
It's unlikely,
but it's reasonable.

16:43.737 --> 16:46.304
Oh. Any luck finding doyle?

16:46.306 --> 16:48.139
No. Not yet.
Hmm.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.274
Is that
veronica's manager?

16:50.276 --> 16:53.177
Yeah. Mick linden.
Just came in.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.512
We're about to lower
the boom.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.613
You need a hand?

16:55.615 --> 16:58.116
Nah. We got it.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.018
Wouldn't want you
to lose him, too.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.259
here's your situation, mick.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.161
Your girl veronica says
she stole

17:10.163 --> 17:11.529
The victim's keys
for a friend of yours.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.164
That makes you an accessory.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.499
Oh, man,
I swear to god...

17:14.501 --> 17:16.300
I- I didn't know he was
gonna do this.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.269
Yeah, well, good luck getting
a jury to buy that.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.771
You're looking at a lot
of time, mr. Linden.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.273
Come on, man. Hey, man,
I just got out six months ago.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.242
I'll tell you what.
You tell us everything

17:25.244 --> 17:27.310
About that murderous friend
of yours,

17:27.313 --> 17:29.480
And we'll tell the d. A.
What a swell guy you are.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.684
His name's ward.
Garrett ward.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.087
Oh, my god. He was
my cellie at five points.

17:36.089 --> 17:40.258
I don't know, man.
He found me last week.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.094
Said he'd just gotten out,
he needed a favor.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.463
I figured it was better to do it
than end up on his hate list.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.165
You're afraid of him.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.201
Hell, yeah. Everyone was.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.402
I mean, this guy was inside
a week,

17:51.404 --> 17:52.770
He was running the cell block.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.739
Guy is ice-cold.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.274
What else do you know
about him?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.542
Nothing, man.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.744
And I shared air
with this guy for years.

17:59.746 --> 18:03.147
Never once did he talk
about his family,

18:03.149 --> 18:05.349
His hometown, his girl.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.852
But he might have been
a soldier.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.587
Yeah, why's that?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.722
'cause he had that way.
Haunted.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.292
Always doing push-ups.
Always on alert.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.561
You know any reason why
he'd target shauna taylor?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.229
He never even mentioned
the name.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.798
And... You said before,
she wasn't his parole officer,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.400
So I have no idea.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.736
Could he have taken her out
as a favor to a friend?

18:25.738 --> 18:28.473
That guy didn't have friends.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.775
But, uh...

18:30.777 --> 18:33.244
Like, sometimes he'd talk
about his mission.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.413
What mission?

18:35.415 --> 18:38.216
Alls he'd say is he had
unfinished business,

18:38.218 --> 18:39.750
And it would change
everything.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.592
Garrett ward.
Till six years ago,

18:47.594 --> 18:48.893
No criminal record.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.496
In fact, until six years ago,
no record at all.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.164
No d. M. V., no military,
nothing.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.465
That's impossible.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.167
Unless he's the other
time traveler

18:56.169 --> 18:57.368
That doyle was talking about.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.203
Whoever he is,
his record begins

18:59.205 --> 19:01.339
When he was arrested
for bringing a backpack bomb

19:01.341 --> 19:03.641
Into a global energy conference
here in manhattan.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.476
And what was his motive?
Well, at the time,

19:05.478 --> 19:07.211
The authorities linked him
to a radical eco group

19:07.213 --> 19:08.679
That was protesting
the conference.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.148
According to his file,

19:10.150 --> 19:11.449
He's some kind of
anti-science nut job.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.451
They found lots of
unabomber-style notebooks on him

19:13.453 --> 19:15.786
Decrying "the destruction
of the rightful kingdom of god

19:15.788 --> 19:17.622
By science and technology."

19:17.624 --> 19:20.258
- What's his connection to doyle?
- Nada.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.327
What do you mean, nada?
Guys, come on, it's so obvious!

19:23.329 --> 19:25.496
Look.
Ward is the guy that doyle

19:25.498 --> 19:27.932
Was sent back in time
to stop, okay?

19:27.934 --> 19:30.334
ward was sent back in time

19:30.336 --> 19:32.336
On some
history-altering mission

19:32.338 --> 19:34.705
That he failed to accomplish,
ending up in prison.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.542
Six years later, he's trying
to complete that mission,

19:37.544 --> 19:40.344
Which is why doyle
has been sent back to now,

19:40.346 --> 19:43.314
Because now is
when the timeline changed.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.316
Well, I was thinking
that maybe

19:45.318 --> 19:48.386
Ward and doyle knew each other
in the non-crazy world,

19:48.388 --> 19:49.720
Like perhaps that eco group

19:49.722 --> 19:51.455
That ward was supposedly
a part of.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.958
Okay. Not as fun.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.961
But why would
an anti-science nut

19:56.963 --> 19:59.630
Torture and murder
a parole officer?

19:59.632 --> 20:01.432
I mean, what's her connection
to any of this?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.867
We still
haven't found one.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.669
Why don't you guys
go back in time

20:04.671 --> 20:06.237
And see if you can dig up

20:06.239 --> 20:08.706
Any of ward's known associates
from six years ago?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.641
Castle and I will look
into his case record,

20:10.643 --> 20:13.778
See if we can find a connection
between him and shauna taylor

20:13.780 --> 20:16.781
Or perhaps figure out what
his unfinished business was.

20:21.486 --> 20:24.288
no, alexis,
I do trust you.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.457
I'm just saying, deciding
to share an apartment

20:26.459 --> 20:28.626
With someone you met
on a banana plantation

20:28.628 --> 20:30.361
A month ago
just doesn't strike me

20:30.363 --> 20:34.565
As the smartest decision
you've ever made.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.235
Alexis, you...

20:37.237 --> 20:39.971
Alexis...

20:41.007 --> 20:42.640
She hung up on me.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.242
Hmm?

20:44.244 --> 20:48.279
Maybe I shouldn't have said
that stuff about the bananas.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.584
Um...

20:53.586 --> 20:55.920
You know, castle,

20:55.922 --> 20:57.622
Maybe this is
a good thing for her.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.192
I mean, she sees us,

21:01.194 --> 21:03.594
And she sees you
starting something new.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.864
Maybe she's just trying to
figure out how she fits in.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.433
You're saying this is
about us?

21:09.435 --> 21:12.270
No. Um, I'm saying
this is about her.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.705
It's... it's about her
growing up.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.576
You know what I'd do
if I had a time machine?

21:18.578 --> 21:20.044
Mm?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.346
I'd go back to...

21:22.348 --> 21:23.981
Relive all those moments.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.816
You know, holding
her tiny hand,

21:25.818 --> 21:27.385
Putting her
up on my shoulders.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.520
Just...

21:29.522 --> 21:31.022
I can't believe
those times are gone.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.557
I know, castle,
but think about

21:33.559 --> 21:35.960
All of the great times
that you have to look forward to

21:35.962 --> 21:38.462
In her future a-and in ours.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.365
Yeah, assuming
there is a future.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.800
If doyle's right,
there may not even be one.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.069
Oh, come on, castle.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.838
whoa.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.775
Look at this.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.343
It's an article
on the attempted bombing.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.412
Look at the picture.

21:54.414 --> 21:57.815
That's malcolm wickfield,
shauna's stepbrother.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.550
He was at the conference?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.085
<i>He wasn't
just at the conference.</i>

22:01.087 --> 22:04.088
He was one of the speakers.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.856
Wickfield's address
was unlisted.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.425
You had to get it
from central.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.026
That's what ward wanted
from shauna?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.495
To find her stepbrother?

22:11.497 --> 22:13.097
He's going after wickfield.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.375
N. Y. P. D. Homicide.

22:24.377 --> 22:27.345
Wife said some guy just
showed up at the door

22:27.347 --> 22:29.947
He beat the hell out of him
then broke his neck.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.825
Yes. That's him.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.493
So what happened?

22:42.495 --> 22:46.097
We were, uh, doing
a crossword puzzle together,

22:46.099 --> 22:48.432
And... The doorbell rang,

22:48.434 --> 22:51.836
And when malcolm answered it,
that man, he...

22:51.838 --> 22:53.137
He grabbed him by the neck

22:53.139 --> 22:54.872
And he dragged him
into the living room

22:54.874 --> 22:58.976
And he... he kept yelling,
"where's the child?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.644
H- how can I find the child?"

23:00.646 --> 23:02.780
What child?
We didn't know.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.016
We told him we didn't know.
We don't have any children.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.853
I called 9-1-1,
and when he heard the sirens,

23:08.855 --> 23:12.556
That's when he...
He killed malcolm.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.826
he... he ran out
before they arrived.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.928
Mrs. Wickfield, what exactly
did your husband do?

23:17.930 --> 23:20.831
He was
a theoretical physicist.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.868
He was trying to isolate
new energy sources.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.170
Why would anyone
target him for that?

23:26.172 --> 23:27.905
Because some people
thought that his...

23:27.907 --> 23:32.410
That somehow he was gonna...
Create a black hole

23:32.412 --> 23:34.879
That was gonna swallow
the earth.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.014
Of course, it was...
it was all nonsense.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.986
<i>Well, the work
is very exciting.</i>

23:41.988 --> 23:43.988
<i>But right now it's all
theoretical.</i>

23:43.990 --> 23:47.024
What our research really offers

23:47.026 --> 23:49.660
<i>Is an entirely new way
of looking at the universe.</i>

23:49.662 --> 23:51.996
Changing the way people
see the universe?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.798
That's exactly
the kind of person

23:53.800 --> 23:56.000
Whose death
could alter the future.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.536
It's also the kind of person
that a crazy anti-science nut

23:58.538 --> 24:00.070
Like ward would fixate on.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.106
Which means any of
the other speakers

24:02.108 --> 24:03.808
At that conference
could be next.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.109
Except now he's looking
for a child.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.944
Okay, contact the conference
organizers.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.846
Get names of everyone
that attended.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.848
Let's see if there are
any children on that list.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.716
This guy's gonna kill again,

24:12.718 --> 24:14.785
And we don't know
anything about him.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.454
I may have found
someone who does.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.989
That eco group that ward
was supposedly a part of?

24:18.991 --> 24:20.991
Well, it's since disbanded,
but its leader at the time

24:20.993 --> 24:22.760
Was a guy
named jack hastings.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.662
He's an environmental author
now,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.697
And his new book,
"our earth's end,"

24:26.699 --> 24:28.499
It's about the coming
eco disasters

24:28.501 --> 24:30.835
And the destruction
of the human race.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.737
if you want to know the future,

24:33.739 --> 24:35.706
Look at the facts.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.108
In less than 35 years,
we'll have no gas,

24:38.110 --> 24:41.011
No coal, and no uranium left.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.981
As our energy resources dwindle
and needs rise

24:43.983 --> 24:48.052
Scarcity will spark
the inevitable...

24:48.054 --> 24:50.855
A massive, bloody world war,

24:50.857 --> 24:53.524
- Probably within the next 20 years...
- Massive, bloody energy wars?

24:53.526 --> 24:55.993
Just like doyle described.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.162
Given how compromised
our planet already is,

24:58.164 --> 25:01.232
Will the human race survive?

25:01.234 --> 25:03.133
Thank you.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.972
Yeah, I knew garrett ward.

25:07.974 --> 25:11.041
When he first came to us,
he said all the right things...

25:11.043 --> 25:13.878
How big oil and coal were
destroying our environment.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.514
He even helped me plan that
sit-in on the energy conference.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.882
After a few weeks,
it became obvious

25:17.884 --> 25:19.583
He didn't care
about the environment.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.886
When he was caught with
that bomb, we realized why.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.755
He was using you to get
into the conference.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.558
So how well did you
know him personally?

25:27.560 --> 25:29.593
Well, enough to know
he was nuts.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.928
How so?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.063
He was... Paranoid.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.732
He was always looking
over his shoulder.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.066
And he'd say things
about the future,

25:36.068 --> 25:39.003
Messed-up things about
apocalyptic wars

25:39.005 --> 25:40.538
And how the human race
needed to be cleansed.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.939
It was pretty creepy.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.074
Kind of like some of
the predictions you just made?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.709
No. This was different.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.578
Ward talked about it
like it was real,

25:47.580 --> 25:48.946
Like it had already happened.

25:51.616 --> 25:54.618
Did he ever say anything to you
about a child?

25:54.620 --> 25:56.086
Not that I recall.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.922
What about this guy?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.223
You recognize him?

25:59.225 --> 26:01.025
Sorry.

26:03.695 --> 26:04.895
Do you know if there was
anyone that he was close to,

26:04.897 --> 26:07.131
Anyone who would know
how to find him?

26:07.133 --> 26:08.799
He burned every bridge
he had

26:08.801 --> 26:10.734
When he walked in
with that bomb.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.002
But if you're looking
for him,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.837
I'd try the east river
power plant.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.639
That's where he was living
six years ago.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.876
He said, uh,
the electromagnetic field

26:18.878 --> 26:21.946
Made it harder
for the government to find him.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.981
I told you,
the guy was crazy.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.627
This place shut down
in 2010.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.362
You really think
he'd come back here?

26:38.364 --> 26:40.631
You can stay in the car
if you're too scared.

26:40.633 --> 26:41.932
Alone?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.635
At an abandoned power plant?
No, thank you.

26:44.637 --> 26:47.004
<i>Maybe we should
put something in our vows</i>

26:47.006 --> 26:49.006
About following each other
into creepy places.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.644
look, I'm just saying...
energy wars,

26:53.646 --> 26:55.012
A soldier from the future...

26:55.014 --> 26:57.982
Everything seems to support
doyle's story.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.050
Aren't you weirded out
by all this?

27:00.052 --> 27:01.885
Why would I be
weirded out?

27:01.887 --> 27:04.121
Ward's just another
paranoid schizophrenic,

27:04.123 --> 27:06.123
No different than
ted kaczynski

27:06.125 --> 27:07.691
Or mark david chapman.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.793
Then how do you explain
doyle?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.729
Well,
probably another crazy

27:11.731 --> 27:13.897
Who got caught up
in his delusion.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.767
He and ward must know
each other somehow.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.737
Castle.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.005
Someone's been here.

27:34.719 --> 27:36.754
Don't... don't...

27:51.369 --> 27:52.803
It's him. Come on.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.304
Where are you going?
Call for backup.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.840
Good idea.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.193
Hey!

28:23.234 --> 28:25.302
damn it.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.304
beckett?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.873
hey. Hey.

28:29.875 --> 28:33.177
Oh. Ow!

28:33.179 --> 28:34.445
Okay.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.414
how'd you find us?

28:37.416 --> 28:39.950
I didn't.
I was tracking ward.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.352
You said you didn't know him,
but he recognized you.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.921
Well, no,
he recognized this, okay?

28:43.923 --> 28:45.456
This is a tracking beacon.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.858
- A what?
- All I have to do is touch him with it,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.260
- and our scientists can pull him right back.
- Drop your weapon. Hands in the air.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.866
Okay. Easy.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.105
Okay. Detective,

29:01.107 --> 29:02.873
The gun is really
not necessary.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.308
The hell it isn't.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.143
How did you get out
of holding?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.778
And how are you involved?

29:07.780 --> 29:09.379
You know how.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.949
You just don't want to
believe me, but trust me,

29:11.951 --> 29:14.051
Detective,

29:14.053 --> 29:16.386
We're on the same side.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.792
You do realize I just
saved your life, right?

29:21.794 --> 29:23.794
Yeah, this is
detective beckett.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.162
I've got a suspect at large.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.131
I'm gonna need patrol sweeps
of the area

29:27.133 --> 29:29.500
Along with a full c. S. U. Team
at the scene.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.535
Real charmer, that one.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.003
I can't believe
you marry her.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.340
- How did you know I marry her?
- One of your book jackets.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.209
With his wife, senator beckett,
and their three children."

29:39.211 --> 29:40.878
Senator?
Three kids?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.780
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It was kind of hard for me

29:42.782 --> 29:44.915
To believe myself,
given all the crazy stuff

29:44.917 --> 29:46.450
- that goes on between you along the way.
- Crazy stuff? What stuff?

29:46.452 --> 29:47.951
Are you kidding me? She...

29:47.953 --> 29:50.020
I'll call you back.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.922
No, I shouldn't say.
I shouldn't say.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.891
I can tell you, thought,
that I'm really glad

29:53.893 --> 29:55.192
You stopped writing those
stupid mystery books, okay?

29:55.194 --> 29:56.894
Because your serious literature
is so much better.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.062
I write serious literature?
Beckett, you hear that?

29:59.064 --> 30:00.798
yeah, I heard.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.566
And I'm the president
of fantasyland.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.468
No, it was... it was
senator, actually.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.203
It was... Senator,
but not if ward

30:06.205 --> 30:07.938
Changes the future,
do you understand me?

30:07.940 --> 30:09.873
Yeah, but didn't the time stream
already change

30:09.875 --> 30:11.508
With wickfield's murder?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.577
No, no, wickfield's death
was a... was a minor disruption.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.379
But all the work
he was doing...

30:15.381 --> 30:16.580
Never amounted to anything.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.215
Nah, he wound up
a footnote in history.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.384
According to our calculations,
uh, the big event,

30:20.386 --> 30:22.186
Whatever it is,
it hasn't happened yet.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.988
- Then why was ward after him?
- I don't know.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.924
You... you said he was looking
for a child, right?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.392
Well, he had...
castle!

30:28.394 --> 30:31.929
Could you please not discuss
details of our with him?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.864
Maybe you could come over here
and help me

30:33.866 --> 30:35.833
Look through this stuff.
We might find a clue...

30:35.835 --> 30:37.534
as to who ward's next victim's
gonna be.

30:39.839 --> 30:40.904
for your information,

30:40.906 --> 30:42.506
I wasn't sharing details
of the case.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.842
I was playing into his delusion
to see what he knew.

30:44.844 --> 30:48.212
Look at this. This is
a photograph of an old letter

30:48.214 --> 30:49.379
Addressed
to malcolm wickfield.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.049
It's dated six years ago.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.051
Looks like it's
from a high school student

30:54.053 --> 30:55.986
Asking to see him speak
at that energy conference.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.288
I don't know.
It's only the first page,

30:58.290 --> 31:00.324
But there's no name
or signature.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.059
But look at the words
ward circled.

31:02.061 --> 31:06.129
"brooklyn," "p. S. 311,"
"state award

31:06.131 --> 31:10.033
Each one's a clue as to
the letter writer's identity.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.568
Ward must have been
after him.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.104
Do you think this is the child
that ward is looking for?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.343
Mr. Doyle...
Do you know who he is?

31:19.345 --> 31:21.144
No, no, I've never
seen him before.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.647
But if ward's targeting him,
there must be a reason.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.649
Why would ward be after
a high school student?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.651
I don't know. But we gotta
find him first.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.320
Yeah, but no name, and only
these clues to go on?

31:30.322 --> 31:31.455
It could take days.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.557
Hey, could I make
a suggestion?

31:33.559 --> 31:35.158
Ward, you know,

31:35.160 --> 31:36.927
He was working off of a photo
of the letter, right?

31:36.929 --> 31:40.564
So perhaps the easier path
is to ask, where's the original?

31:40.566 --> 31:43.567
It's bound to have
the kid's name and address.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.270
a letter from six years ago.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.639
Good thing most geniuses
are pack rats.

31:48.641 --> 31:50.941
I kept trying to get him
to throw some of this stuff out,

31:50.943 --> 31:53.510
But he never would. Uh, let me
see that picture again.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.647
- Oh, yeah.
- You sure you've never seen the kid before?

31:56.649 --> 31:59.149
No, but, uh, malcolm was
very encouraging to students,

31:59.151 --> 32:01.852
So it's a possibility
that he knew him.

32:01.854 --> 32:05.255
wait a minute.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.657
Here.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.467
That's it.

32:18.636 --> 32:22.205
It's written by some kid
named paul deschile.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.274
Wait a second. No.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.177
<i>That's not "de-shiel."
um...</i>

32:27.179 --> 32:28.578
<i>It's "duh-child."</i>

32:28.580 --> 32:30.514
He wasn't looking
for "the child,"

32:30.516 --> 32:32.149
<i>He was looking for deschile.</i>

32:34.686 --> 32:36.586
Who the hell's
paul deschile?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.622
he's a 21-year-old
student at hudson

32:38.624 --> 32:41.291
Getting his post-doc
in theoretical physics.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.393
All right, get him into
protective custody.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.728
He's on leave this semester.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.229
The university has no idea
where he is.

32:46.231 --> 32:49.232
- But they moved out of state a few years ago.
- Detective, it's him!

32:49.234 --> 32:50.634
Deschile.
You know him?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.436
Of course I know him.
Everyone knows him.

32:52.438 --> 32:56.106
Okay, I'll call you back.
Doyle, sit down.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.641
No wonder
billions of people die.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.743
Okay, who the hell
is paul deschile?

32:59.745 --> 33:01.678
The energy wars, all right?
I told you about the other side.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.147
A group of fascists...
they were worse than the nazis.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.582
Th-they were
slaughtering people

33:05.584 --> 33:07.184
By the tens
of thousands, okay?

33:07.186 --> 33:10.687
Until deschile... he and his team,
they created an energy shield.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.456
Okay? It was able to stop
their weapons

33:12.458 --> 33:13.657
And completely
turn the tide.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.258
Detective, listen to me!

33:15.260 --> 33:17.227
Ward is still obviously
fighting for the fascists!

33:17.229 --> 33:20.163
They're trying to win the war
by rewriting history!

33:20.165 --> 33:22.599
And if he kills deschile,
there will be no energy shield!

33:22.601 --> 33:25.669
And without that energy shield,
we lose that war!

33:25.671 --> 33:27.304
Ward's gonna kill deschile,

33:27.306 --> 33:29.706
And that is why
billions of people die!

33:29.708 --> 33:34.511
- Take him to holding, please.
- Fine, we don't have time. You're correct, okay?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.780
Forget everything I said!
Forget about time travel!

33:36.782 --> 33:38.782
Forget about wars!
None of that matters!

33:38.784 --> 33:41.485
All that matters is deschile!
You understand me?

33:41.487 --> 33:45.455
You keep him alive!
He cannot die!

33:48.526 --> 33:49.393
No. Deschile. Yeah.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.194
Paul deschile.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.663
No, wait, please don't...
don't put me on hold.

33:53.665 --> 33:57.067
- Anything?
- Esposito got ahold of his parents in oregon.

33:57.069 --> 34:00.037
They think he's staying
with a friend in the city,

34:00.039 --> 34:04.741
You don't think any of this
could possibly be real, do you?

34:04.743 --> 34:06.510
I don't know, castle,

34:06.512 --> 34:09.279
But I have no intention
of letting this kid die.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.681
Yes. Hi. This is
detective kate beckett, n. Y. P. D.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.717
I'm trying to get ahold
of a paul deschile.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.719
Where?

34:16.722 --> 34:18.155
He's at the planetarium.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.223
Wait, just like you told
what other guy?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.359
Who else did you tell?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.561
Ward knows.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.129
Planetarium's
all the way uptown.

34:26.130 --> 34:31.568
<i>the cosmos
is vast and glorious...</i>

34:31.570 --> 34:34.204
<i>More wondrous
than we can fathom.</i>

34:34.206 --> 34:39.509
<i>It takes our breath away
and ignites our imagination.</i>

34:39.511 --> 34:41.745
<i>It is the essence
of time itself...</i>

34:41.746 --> 34:45.114
<i>The past, the present,
and the future.</i>

34:45.117 --> 34:49.085
<i>It's an enigma
seemingly impossible to grasp,</i>

34:49.088 --> 34:53.456
<i>And yet we pursue
its mysteries.</i>

34:53.458 --> 34:55.559
<i>We dare to reach out
to understand</i>

34:55.561 --> 34:59.529
<i>Swirling galaxies,
exploding stars...</i>

35:21.487 --> 35:22.586
Freeze!

35:24.590 --> 35:27.591
- Don't even think about it!
- N. Y. P. D.! Let me see your hands right now!

35:30.162 --> 35:31.561
Knife!

35:37.568 --> 35:39.369
You okay, kid?

35:45.209 --> 35:46.643
Why wickfield?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.379
Why deschile?

35:53.518 --> 35:55.519
What were you hoping
to accomplish?

36:07.498 --> 36:10.400
Who is that man?

36:14.805 --> 36:17.841
You ran from him
at the power plant. Why?

36:22.647 --> 36:26.516
Mr. Ward, there is no record
of you before 2007.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.351
Where are you from?

36:33.824 --> 36:35.592
Okay, ward.

36:39.264 --> 36:43.600
whatever you thought
you were doing...

36:45.603 --> 36:46.703
It's over.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.646
what'd he say?

36:56.648 --> 36:59.316
Nothing.
No apocalyptic visions,

36:59.318 --> 37:01.651
No nightmarish warnings
of dire things to come?

37:01.653 --> 37:04.287
Whatever delusions he has
in his head,

37:04.289 --> 37:06.590
He is keeping them
to himself.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.625
Well, if nothing doyle said
was true,

37:08.627 --> 37:10.594
Why else would ward
target deschile?

37:10.596 --> 37:14.431
I'm the one who alerted security
to ward's behavior

37:14.433 --> 37:16.233
At the energy conference
six years ago.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.801
They stopped him
because of me.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.237
It looks like this was all
just about revenge.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.839
I'm just sorry it cost
dr. Wickfield his life.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.242
You know, the talk he gave
at that conference

37:25.244 --> 37:27.744
Rocked my world,
and if it wasn't for him,

37:27.746 --> 37:29.479
I'd probably be doing
something

37:29.481 --> 37:30.880
Completely different
with my life.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.916
Come on, man.
I'll walk you out.

37:35.486 --> 37:38.622
So, there is a simple
explanation after all.

37:38.624 --> 37:42.926
Yes. Now we know why ward
tried to bomb that conference...

37:42.928 --> 37:44.427
To kill deschile.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.263
You see, in the future,
when the famous deschile

37:46.265 --> 37:48.498
Will give interviews, he'll say
that's where it all started.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.434
Consequently, ward will know
exactly where...

37:51.436 --> 37:54.471
And when... to find him.

37:54.473 --> 37:57.307
You're trying to drive me crazy,
aren't you?

37:57.309 --> 38:00.510
Well, apparently I already do,
if we end up with three kids.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.545
Would you like to know
their names?

38:02.547 --> 38:03.980
Yes.
No!

38:03.982 --> 38:06.616
Doyle? What are you
doing out?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.318
Well, you said that I had
the right to an attorney,

38:08.320 --> 38:11.488
- What about your psych eval?
- Oh, please. Are you kidding me?

38:11.490 --> 38:14.324
But you should have heard
the crazy stuff

38:14.326 --> 38:15.625
Coming out of my mouth.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.495
I mean, I haven't lied
that much in years.

38:18.497 --> 38:20.497
- But I...
- Now, now, detective, don't be upset.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.932
Because of you,
billions of people are alive.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.535
Because of you,
future generations are safe.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.003
I don't care
what you say, doyle.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.872
There's a connection
between you and ward,

38:28.874 --> 38:30.807
And it has nothing to do
with time travel.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.709
And I'm gonna find out
what it is.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.411
Okay. Good luck.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.880
Because before yesterday,
I had never even met ward.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.615
that's not entirely true.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.885
I went back through
ward's incarceration file.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.787
Before his trial,
he spent two weeks

38:43.789 --> 38:47.057
In a psychiatric ward being
evaluated by the state.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.593
In the next room was
another patient, a john doe.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.495
I had them pull his photo.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.930
And there's the connection.

38:53.932 --> 38:57.000
No, no, no. That...
that's... that's ridiculous.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.537
Because I have never, ever...

39:00.539 --> 39:02.439
Oh, wow,
that's really clever.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.506
What? What's clever?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.108
That's me.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.476
Right? But I-I haven't
done it yet.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.011
don't you see?

39:08.013 --> 39:11.981
they're gonna send me back
to make contact with him,

39:11.983 --> 39:13.550
Find out who he works for, if
they're planning anything else.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.618
It's perfect.

39:16.921 --> 39:19.756
Oh, wow. Uh, I don't
have much time left.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.459
Um... I don't know.
See you in 20 years.

39:22.461 --> 39:25.762
is it... is it just me,
or does that make sense?

39:25.764 --> 39:27.530
No, it's just you.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.366
Ooh, he forgot
his little doohickey there.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.592
Hey. So what happened?

39:56.727 --> 39:58.695
Um...

39:59.530 --> 40:00.764
Missed him.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.832
Well...

40:02.834 --> 40:05.535
You know what?

40:05.537 --> 40:09.072
After a case like this one,
I think a warm and cozy bath

40:09.074 --> 40:10.740
Is in my future.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.442
Talk to you tonight?

40:12.444 --> 40:14.644
Sounds good.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.618
jeez.

40:58.522 --> 40:59.923
You're really doing this?

40:59.925 --> 41:03.493
I am.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.962
I know what you're thinking.

41:05.964 --> 41:09.132
You're thinking I'm making
a huge mistake.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.167
What if you are?

41:11.169 --> 41:15.104
This isn't something
you can just go back and undo.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.574
Why don't you wait
a year, okay?

41:17.576 --> 41:20.543
I'm sure pi can
take care of himself.

41:20.545 --> 41:23.046
And if after a year you still
want to move in together,

41:23.048 --> 41:24.514
I won't say a word.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.015
Yes, you will.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.818
I don't know how this
is gonna turn out, dad.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.554
None of us do.

41:31.556 --> 41:34.624
But it's my life,
my future.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.262
I have to find out
for myself.

41:39.264 --> 41:43.066
Who are you always saying is
the smart one in the family?

41:44.268 --> 41:46.603
You.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.573
Dad, I know what I'm doing.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.110
It'll be okay.

42:07.825 --> 42:10.894
Too soon.
