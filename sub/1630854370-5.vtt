WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:24.655 --> 00:25.862
Well, it's nice
chatting with you all.

00:25.862 --> 00:28.275
But I should probably
give Rex a breather.

00:28.275 --> 00:31.206
Even the best cops need a
break every now and again.

00:31.206 --> 00:32.655
<i>Excuse me.</i>

00:32.655 --> 00:33.413
Come on pal.

00:37.206 --> 00:37.896
Hey guys.

00:37.896 --> 00:39.034
Let's hear
it for Mr. S, huh?

00:39.034 --> 00:40.103
Let's hear
it for Mr. S!

00:40.862 --> 00:41.586
<i>My new favourite teacher!</i>

00:42.344 --> 00:43.172
<i>Come on,
let him know!</i>

00:44.241 --> 00:45.310
How are you
guys doing?

00:46.862 --> 00:48.137
Yeah, I know.

00:48.517 --> 00:49.551
I'm not exactly
what you're thinking.

00:49.551 --> 00:50.586
You're thinking
who's this old guy?

00:50.586 --> 00:52.137
And what's he going to
be droning on about?

00:52.896 --> 00:53.551
<i>Well, good news.</i>

00:53.551 --> 00:54.620
<i>First of all-</i>

00:54.620 --> 00:55.655
<i>I'm not going to be
talking about algebra-</i>

00:55.655 --> 00:57.724
<i>or history or
geography okay?</i>

00:57.724 --> 00:58.862
<i>So don't worry
about it.</i>

00:58.965 --> 01:00.034
<i>No guys, I'm
here today-</i>

01:00.034 --> 01:03.172
to talk about what it
truly means to be a hero.

01:03.172 --> 01:04.551
<i>Is that something you
guys are interested in?</i>

01:04.551 --> 01:05.241
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:06.068 --> 01:07.586
Let me tell
you my story.

01:09.344 --> 01:10.551
About a year ago-

01:10.551 --> 01:12.241
I was working with
the Drugs and Gang Unit.

01:12.241 --> 01:13.931
And one night I
responded to a call-

01:13.931 --> 01:14.827
routine call-

01:14.827 --> 01:16.068
just like any
other night-

01:16.068 --> 01:16.896
<i>or so I thought.</i>

01:16.896 --> 01:17.896
<i>But all of
a sudden-</i>

01:17.896 --> 01:19.448
I found myself in the
middle of an ambush.

01:21.724 --> 01:22.793
<i>I was being ambushed-</i>

01:22.793 --> 01:25.172
by a group of violent,
ruthless drug dealers-

01:25.655 --> 01:27.517
led by a young skeet
named Luke Pearson.

01:27.517 --> 01:28.413
Maybe you've
heard of him?

01:28.413 --> 01:30.689
<i>Not exactly
the best kind.</i>

01:30.689 --> 01:32.413
<i>What I thought was
going to be a routine night-</i>

01:32.413 --> 01:33.482
<i>turned into a nightmare.</i>

01:34.206 --> 01:35.689
I almost died
that night.

01:37.517 --> 01:39.551
And I still have a bullet
in my back to prove it.

01:39.551 --> 01:41.655
Took me off the
force for good.

01:41.758 --> 01:43.103
Is this age appropriate?

01:43.103 --> 01:43.896
Definitely not.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.689
So what do
you do exactly?

01:47.758 --> 01:49.517
Well, I'm a detective.

01:50.827 --> 01:51.689
And what's your deal?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.758
I'm a forensicist.

01:53.758 --> 01:55.172
So that makes
you what?

01:55.172 --> 01:55.931
The sidekick?

01:56.586 --> 01:57.482
No, I'm-

01:57.482 --> 01:58.344
I do digital forensics.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.068
<i>Oh!</i>

01:59.068 --> 02:00.310
So you're not
a real cop then?

02:01.000 --> 02:01.793
I'm-

02:03.827 --> 02:05.103
I'm sort of like
a cyber detective.

02:05.103 --> 02:05.827
It's really-

02:05.827 --> 02:06.655
<i>the wave of
the future.</i>

02:06.655 --> 02:07.896
The bike cops
have funnel cakes!

02:08.241 --> 02:09.172
Okay.

02:09.172 --> 02:09.827
Cyber detective?

02:09.827 --> 02:10.482
<i>Bang!</i>

02:10.482 --> 02:11.758
<i>Skeet two down!</i>

02:11.758 --> 02:13.413
<i>And that's when
things go to hell.</i>

02:13.413 --> 02:14.413
<i>It was a trap.</i>

02:14.413 --> 02:15.103
<i>Now many people-</i>

02:15.103 --> 02:15.862
would have ran away.

02:15.862 --> 02:16.586
Taken cover.

02:16.586 --> 02:17.655
How can you
blame them?

02:17.655 --> 02:19.620
It was a pretty
hairy sitch.

02:19.620 --> 02:20.413
But not me.

02:20.413 --> 02:21.586
I stayed.

02:22.482 --> 02:23.586
Because I knew-

02:23.586 --> 02:25.689
I had to protect the community
that I love so much.

02:25.689 --> 02:30.103
<i>Just like every single
brave member of the SJPD.</i>

02:30.103 --> 02:33.103
That is what it
means to be a hero.

02:34.034 --> 02:36.068
Yeah, maybe it's time for us
to step outside for a sec-

02:36.068 --> 02:37.137
<i>before it's
our turn to talk.</i>

02:37.137 --> 02:38.000
<i>Come on.</i>

02:38.000 --> 02:38.862
<i>I look
around this group.</i>

02:38.862 --> 02:40.068
<i>And I know
there's a hero-</i>

02:40.068 --> 02:42.896
in each and
every one of you.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.655
<i>Well to be honest-</i>

02:49.655 --> 02:50.655
I thought I
was invincible.

02:50.655 --> 02:52.137
<i>It took getting shot
for me to realize-</i>

02:52.137 --> 02:53.379
<i>that it could
all just be over.</i>

02:53.379 --> 02:54.482
In that moment-

02:54.482 --> 02:57.620
how did you know what to
do under all that pressure?

02:57.620 --> 02:59.172
That's when all the years of
preparation and training-

02:59.172 --> 03:00.310
really pay off.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.034
<i>When there's
no time to think-</i>

03:02.034 --> 03:03.862
<i>all you have is instinct
and adrenaline.</i>

03:03.862 --> 03:04.620
Wow.

03:06.137 --> 03:06.965
You must be
tired buddy.

03:06.965 --> 03:07.827
I'll take it
from here.

03:07.827 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.482
<i>I can't sit too long
with this bullet in my back.</i>

03:10.482 --> 03:11.793
Nice chatting
with you kid.

03:13.896 --> 03:15.137
Can I have
a book?

03:15.793 --> 03:16.655
Yeah, yeah.

03:17.862 --> 03:18.655
Thanks.

03:19.586 --> 03:21.000
I think the secret
to public speaking-

03:21.000 --> 03:23.586
is kind of being comfortable
with the silence.

03:23.586 --> 03:24.344
Silence-

03:24.344 --> 03:25.034
buddy-

03:25.034 --> 03:26.206
is punctuation.

03:26.206 --> 03:26.931
Hey.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.517
<i>Great talk man.</i>

03:28.517 --> 03:29.448
<i>Thanks, Hudson.</i>

03:29.896 --> 03:30.517
Come on pal.

03:30.517 --> 03:31.310
We're up next.

03:36.448 --> 03:37.103
Rex?

03:37.758 --> 03:38.448
Hey wait!

03:42.241 --> 03:42.862
<i>What happened?</i>

03:42.862 --> 03:43.517
<i>Are you okay?</i>

03:43.517 --> 03:44.275
I'm okay.

03:44.275 --> 03:45.413
It's the hero
guy that's not.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.310
Your dog attacked
him, you know?

03:47.965 --> 03:48.620
Attacked?

04:05.586 --> 04:06.896
It's okay, Rex.

04:06.896 --> 04:07.862
It's going
to be okay.

04:08.965 --> 04:11.034
Kyle, when you say that
Rex attacked Mr. Osgoode-

04:11.034 --> 04:12.275
what exactly
did you see?

04:12.931 --> 04:13.827
Well he barked.

04:13.827 --> 04:16.241
And I looked up
from my book.

04:16.241 --> 04:17.103
Next thing I know-

04:17.103 --> 04:18.379
the hero guy was
going down the stairs.

04:18.379 --> 04:20.034
You saw Rex jump
on Mr. Osgoode?

04:20.034 --> 04:21.310
That's how
he fell, right?

04:21.310 --> 04:23.482
No but did you see him put his
teeth or his paws on the man?

04:23.482 --> 04:24.310
<i>Look.</i>

04:24.310 --> 04:25.275
I don't know, man.

04:26.758 --> 04:27.379
Okay, Kyle.

04:27.379 --> 04:28.068
Thanks.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.068
Thank you
for your help.

04:29.068 --> 04:29.724
Yeah.

04:29.724 --> 04:30.413
Osgoode.

04:31.758 --> 04:32.689
What the hell happened?

04:33.344 --> 04:35.172
Your dog jumped
me for no reason.

04:35.172 --> 04:36.448
He could've been killed!

04:37.517 --> 04:38.310
He jumped you?

04:38.793 --> 04:39.620
I don't understand.

04:39.620 --> 04:40.310
<i>It's no
mystery Hudson.</i>

04:40.310 --> 04:42.413
Your dog is dangerous.

04:42.413 --> 04:43.137
You mind?

04:43.482 --> 04:44.275
Charlie!

04:45.620 --> 04:46.344
Hey!

04:46.448 --> 04:47.000
Charlie.

04:47.000 --> 04:47.689
Hey!

04:48.724 --> 04:49.068
<i>Listen, you've
got to leave him.</i>

04:49.068 --> 04:49.827
I'm sorry.

04:49.827 --> 04:51.034
You can't interfere
with this.

04:51.034 --> 04:54.137
<i>They're expecting Rex downtown.</i>

04:54.137 --> 04:54.793
It's procedure.

04:54.793 --> 04:55.689
Procedure?

04:55.689 --> 04:56.620
No Joe, this is a misunderstanding.

04:56.620 --> 04:57.586
You don't understand.

04:57.586 --> 04:58.689
He doesn't attack if
I don't command him.

04:58.689 --> 04:59.724
<i>Look Charlie.</i>

04:59.724 --> 05:01.344
I have two eyewitnesses
who said that he did.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.413
I don't understand
this, Joe.

05:02.413 --> 05:03.137
What did you see?

05:04.827 --> 05:05.655
I wasn't there.

05:05.655 --> 05:06.344
Guys.

05:07.448 --> 05:08.172
There are no security
cameras in the stairwell.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.344
Can I have
a minute?

05:15.137 --> 05:16.000
Okay.

05:22.068 --> 05:23.068
Really?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.103
Hey bud, hi.

05:27.655 --> 05:28.310
Hey.

05:29.241 --> 05:29.862
Hey pal.

05:29.862 --> 05:30.896
It's okay.

05:31.068 --> 05:31.827
It's okay.

05:33.241 --> 05:34.551
I'm going to clear
your name okay?

05:35.655 --> 05:36.448
I promise.

05:54.758 --> 05:55.655
<i>Open the front gate!</i>

05:55.655 --> 05:57.241
<i>Let the K9 through!</i>

05:58.655 --> 05:59.689
<i>Stand back please!</i>

05:59.689 --> 06:00.931
<i>Stand back!</i>

06:09.793 --> 06:11.896
Did you have any sense
something was off about Rex-

06:11.896 --> 06:12.551
before the incident?

06:12.551 --> 06:13.413
Not at all.

06:13.931 --> 06:14.655
He was calm.

06:14.655 --> 06:16.172
He was enjoying
himself, even.

06:16.172 --> 06:18.620
How do we know that it wasn't
Osgoode that provoked him?

06:18.620 --> 06:20.034
We have Osgoode's
word, Charlie.

06:20.206 --> 06:21.689
He's an SJPD
poster boy.

06:21.689 --> 06:24.724
Local news has video of him
being loaded into the ambulance.

06:24.724 --> 06:26.827
<i>They're having a
field day with it-</i>

06:26.827 --> 06:29.586
asking whether K9 dogs
are dangerous weapons.

06:29.586 --> 06:30.620
So how do
we fix this?

06:30.620 --> 06:31.758
I want Rex assessed.

06:32.344 --> 06:33.241
If he did attack-

06:33.241 --> 06:34.689
that could be a sign
something is wrong.

06:35.344 --> 06:36.034
With Rex?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.103
Fine.

06:43.103 --> 06:43.827
Fine, run your tests.

06:44.827 --> 06:45.689
Whatever it takes to
get Rex back on duty.

06:45.689 --> 06:46.827
<i>In the meantime-</i>

06:46.827 --> 06:48.482
I suggest you go pay Osgoode
a visit in the hospital.

06:49.517 --> 06:50.482
<i>Listen to me.</i>

06:50.482 --> 06:52.689
A little diplomacy here
will go a long way.

06:59.448 --> 07:00.655
How's it going?

07:00.655 --> 07:02.793
Oh I skipped straight to the
chapter with the shoot-out.

07:02.793 --> 07:04.793
I mean it reads like
a scene from John Wick.

07:05.689 --> 07:06.724
This guy-

07:06.724 --> 07:08.896
he faced off Luke Pearson
and his goons alone!

07:08.896 --> 07:10.586
He's got
nerves of steel.

07:10.586 --> 07:13.034
He doesn't share John Wick's
affection for dogs.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.724
You think he did
something to Rex?

07:15.724 --> 07:17.724
I can't imagine Rex would
attack him without reason.

07:17.724 --> 07:18.482
I don't know.

07:18.482 --> 07:19.413
Osgoode seems
like a good guy.

07:19.413 --> 07:20.172
A real cop.

07:20.172 --> 07:21.137
It just doesn't
make any sense.

07:21.137 --> 07:22.034
Real cop?

07:23.137 --> 07:23.827
Are you letting that mean
girl get into your head?

07:23.827 --> 07:24.586
Okay.

07:24.586 --> 07:25.827
I bought harem pants-

07:25.827 --> 07:27.931
when Stinky Stacy said they
looked hot on Justin Bieber.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.379
I'm impressionable.

07:30.482 --> 07:31.793
This is different.

07:31.793 --> 07:32.482
It-

07:33.689 --> 07:36.551
Sarah I want to be more
than a desk cop, you know?

07:36.551 --> 07:37.586
<i>Jesse.</i>

07:37.586 --> 07:39.310
You <i>are</i> more than
just a desk cop!

07:41.724 --> 07:42.586
You know what?

07:43.724 --> 07:45.724
I think I need to go for
my firearms qualification.

07:46.413 --> 07:47.517
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:47.517 --> 07:49.344
Yeah, do you want to go
to the firing range with me?

07:50.068 --> 07:51.482
I mean, yeah.

07:51.482 --> 07:52.586
<i>Sure.</i>

07:52.586 --> 07:53.310
Okay.

07:54.413 --> 07:55.068
Also.

07:55.068 --> 07:55.724
Stinky Stacey?

07:55.724 --> 07:56.413
Yeah.

07:56.413 --> 07:57.137
It was really weird.

07:57.137 --> 07:58.517
She gave herself
that nickname.

08:00.482 --> 08:01.172
I got that.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.344
Yeah.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.379
What did you
do to this?

08:03.379 --> 08:04.517
I don't know.

08:21.379 --> 08:22.034
Hey hey hey!

08:34.344 --> 08:35.482
Come on!

08:36.137 --> 08:37.310
Come on!

08:44.862 --> 08:45.517
Good boy.

08:49.241 --> 08:49.896
Osgoode.

08:50.586 --> 08:51.413
What are you
doing here?

08:51.413 --> 08:52.448
<i>Come on!</i>

08:52.448 --> 08:53.482
Came in to sign
my statement.

08:53.482 --> 08:54.344
Thought I'd check in-

08:54.344 --> 08:55.551
<i>on your dog's
remedial training-</i>

08:55.551 --> 08:56.896
<i>while I was here.</i>

08:57.655 --> 09:01.448
Look, I went to go
see you at the hospital.

09:01.448 --> 09:03.551
I wanted to talk to you
about exactly what happened.

09:03.551 --> 09:04.448
Come on Hudson.

09:05.793 --> 09:07.413
You should be
happy, man!

09:08.655 --> 09:11.655
Your days of being stuck with
a dog for a partner are over.

09:11.655 --> 09:12.586
<i>Come on!</i>

09:12.586 --> 09:13.689
<i>Hey!</i>

09:13.689 --> 09:14.724
<i>Maybe now
you can take a crack-</i>

09:14.724 --> 09:16.517
at being
a real cop.

09:16.517 --> 09:17.413
What is your
problem man?

09:17.413 --> 09:18.655
<i>Hmm?</i>

09:20.689 --> 09:21.965
Hey! Easy!

09:23.103 --> 09:23.862
Easy pal!

09:24.931 --> 09:26.068
Easy pal.

09:26.068 --> 09:27.172
<i>Easy!</i>

09:31.137 --> 09:31.931
<i>Charlie.</i>

09:31.931 --> 09:33.517
Rex isn't reacting
to Osgoode.

09:34.137 --> 09:36.241
He's reacting to you
reacting to Osgoode.

09:36.344 --> 09:37.758
<i>I'm going to need
you to leave.</i>

09:37.758 --> 09:38.448
Uh-

09:38.448 --> 09:39.310
<i>Both of you.</i>

09:41.655 --> 09:42.586
Now!

10:06.482 --> 10:07.206
Hey.

10:07.724 --> 10:08.517
Hey.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.379
I can't imagine the
team without Rex.

10:11.379 --> 10:12.724
It's not going
to come to that.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.793
I can't deny how
impressed I am with Rex.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.413
He passed every test
with flying colours-

10:24.517 --> 10:27.000
<i>after you and
Osgoode left.</i>

10:27.000 --> 10:27.896
<i>And the vet check-</i>

10:27.896 --> 10:29.034
came back clean.

10:29.034 --> 10:29.758
He's in great shape.

10:30.413 --> 10:31.172
Yeah yeah!

10:31.172 --> 10:31.827
That's great!

10:32.482 --> 10:33.448
Yeah I know!

10:33.448 --> 10:34.758
That's great bud!

10:37.931 --> 10:38.827
You're not done.

10:38.827 --> 10:39.689
<i>The problem is-</i>

10:39.689 --> 10:40.965
there's no way
to determine-

10:40.965 --> 10:43.275
why Rex attacked Osgoode
without command.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.448
<i>So we can't be sure
it won't happen again.</i>

10:45.448 --> 10:46.965
<i>Internal Affairs has spoken.</i>

10:46.965 --> 10:47.896
I'm sorry Charlie.

10:47.896 --> 10:48.724
But um-

10:49.586 --> 10:50.482
Rex is off
the team.

11:06.551 --> 11:07.551
So if nothing's
wrong with Rex-

11:08.344 --> 11:09.310
which we know, buddy-

11:09.310 --> 11:11.413
there's something wrong
with Bruce Osgoode.

11:11.413 --> 11:13.931
<i>You said he left the hospital
before he was examined?</i>

11:13.931 --> 11:15.931
Yeah, they were looking
for him when I arrived.

11:15.931 --> 11:17.000
They wanted
to run some tests-

11:17.000 --> 11:19.172
because apparently
his pupils were dilated.

11:19.172 --> 11:20.758
<i>Could be a sign
of concussion.</i>

11:20.758 --> 11:22.000
Yeah, he also-

11:22.758 --> 11:24.241
could be on drugs.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.413
Hmm.

11:25.862 --> 11:26.896
You think that
I'm reaching?

11:26.896 --> 11:27.586
Well it would explain-

11:27.586 --> 11:28.620
why he left.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.827
But Osgoode's got a lot
of people behind him-

11:30.827 --> 11:32.000
in the department.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.379
So you think I
should leave it alone?

11:33.379 --> 11:34.241
No.

11:34.241 --> 11:36.413
No, I think you
should be discreet.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.482
Hmm.

11:39.413 --> 11:40.206
Hey bud.

11:40.206 --> 11:42.068
Um- listen.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.862
You're going to have
to stay here today okay?

11:43.862 --> 11:45.034
I'm going to
be back later.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.931
<i>I'll have an ear
on him today.</i>

11:46.931 --> 11:48.034
<i>Alexa.</i>

11:48.034 --> 11:49.655
Tell Rex Charlie and
Sarah are leaving for work.

11:49.655 --> 11:51.482
<i>Okay, Rex.</i>

11:51.482 --> 11:54.172
<i>Charlie and Sarah
are leaving for work.</i>

11:54.172 --> 11:54.931
I promise.

11:55.241 --> 11:56.413
I'm going
to fix this.

11:59.931 --> 12:00.896
See you pal.

12:04.137 --> 12:04.965
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

12:26.482 --> 12:27.241
Hey.

12:27.551 --> 12:28.448
You're in early.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.758
Yeah, I thought I'd
get a head start.

12:29.758 --> 12:31.448
I ran a full search
on Osgoode.

12:32.137 --> 12:32.931
Thanks Jesse.

12:32.931 --> 12:34.000
But maybe make
that your last.

12:35.034 --> 12:36.344
You're not taking
this lying down.

12:36.896 --> 12:37.896
No.

12:37.896 --> 12:40.517
But Osgoode isn't under
official investigation.

12:40.517 --> 12:42.379
If anyone's going to take
the heat for looking into him-

12:42.379 --> 12:43.241
it should be me.

12:43.344 --> 12:44.724
So I shouldn't
tell you-

12:44.724 --> 12:46.689
that Osgoode's file
is on the printer tray.

13:08.482 --> 13:09.931
Oh excuse me.

13:10.862 --> 13:11.965
<i>Are you a
friend of Bruce's?</i>

13:13.137 --> 13:15.517
Well, I'm more of
a former colleague.

13:15.517 --> 13:16.655
<i>Could you ask him-</i>

13:16.655 --> 13:19.275
to please return
Mrs. Zeoli's loaf pan?

13:19.862 --> 13:21.103
Yeah, yeah,
I'm on it.

13:21.827 --> 13:23.275
<i>Oh, and remind him-</i>

13:23.275 --> 13:25.482
not to use
metal utensils.

13:25.482 --> 13:27.620
<i>Tell him to take
the banana bread out-</i>

13:27.620 --> 13:29.655
put it
on a plate-

13:29.655 --> 13:32.034
and then cut
it there, okay?

13:33.551 --> 13:34.620
Okay.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.655
Peace offering.

13:38.620 --> 13:39.413
Thanks.

13:40.965 --> 13:41.655
<i>Come on in.</i>

13:41.655 --> 13:42.793
<i>Sorry about the mess.</i>

13:42.793 --> 13:44.689
I'm actually trying to make
headway on my new book.

13:44.689 --> 13:45.344
<i>Ah.</i>

13:45.344 --> 13:46.344
Yeah.

13:46.344 --> 13:47.344
<i>Look, uh-</i>

13:47.344 --> 13:49.241
Rex and I have worked
a lot of hours together.

13:49.241 --> 13:51.137
He's never attacked
anybody without cause.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.689
<i>Can you tell me
exactly what he did?</i>

13:52.689 --> 13:55.896
Well he barked
and he lunged.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.034
He made physical contact?

14:01.034 --> 14:02.310
He would've-

14:02.310 --> 14:03.413
if I didn't
jump back.

14:03.413 --> 14:04.344
I reached
for the rail.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.551
My hand slipped.

14:05.551 --> 14:06.379
You know.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.620
<i>A lunge isn't
in his training.</i>

14:07.620 --> 14:08.620
The bark, though.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.379
That's meant to
alert me to something.

14:10.379 --> 14:11.275
Oh is it?

14:11.275 --> 14:11.965
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

14:13.206 --> 14:13.827
Like what?

14:13.827 --> 14:14.482
Weapons.

14:14.482 --> 14:15.655
Explosives.

14:16.827 --> 14:17.724
Drugs.

14:19.034 --> 14:20.758
Well I can't help you
there, Detective.

14:20.758 --> 14:21.724
<i>You left the hospital-</i>

14:21.724 --> 14:22.793
before you were examined.

14:22.793 --> 14:25.241
Were you worried about
getting a blood test?

14:28.517 --> 14:29.758
Come on Osgoode.

14:30.517 --> 14:31.931
You've got a bullet
lodged in your back.

14:31.931 --> 14:33.379
I understand you
must be in pain.

14:33.724 --> 14:35.068
People in those
circumstances-

14:35.068 --> 14:35.896
they gravitate
to opiates.

14:35.896 --> 14:37.344
I left the hospital-

14:37.344 --> 14:40.413
because after spending 26 days
in the ICU when I was shot-

14:40.413 --> 14:42.206
I'm not exactly a fan
of the place okay?

14:42.206 --> 14:43.241
<i>I just don't
want my partner-</i>

14:43.241 --> 14:44.965
going down
because of this.

14:44.965 --> 14:46.000
<i>The department
can get you help.</i>

14:46.000 --> 14:46.689
Look.

14:50.586 --> 14:52.655
I don't have
a drug problem.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.586
Your dog has an
aggression problem.

14:56.586 --> 14:58.034
And you're actually
really lucky-

14:58.034 --> 15:01.586
that I'm not pushing for
more of a finite solution.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.862
Rex is only a threat to people
who have something to hide.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.965
<i>And you were
a cop before.</i>

15:09.965 --> 15:11.068
You should know-

15:11.068 --> 15:12.551
that I'm not letting my
partner go without a fight.

15:12.551 --> 15:13.862
<i>And you should know-</i>

15:13.862 --> 15:17.137
I'm not going to be intimidated
by some glorified K9 officer.

15:20.517 --> 15:21.413
Hmm.

15:21.827 --> 15:22.827
Get well soon.

15:23.275 --> 15:24.448
Mmmm.

15:25.862 --> 15:28.068
And give Mrs. Zeoli
her loaf pan back.

15:32.517 --> 15:33.551
TV host: <i>Shall
we talk lighting?</i>

15:33.551 --> 15:35.000
<i>Let's have some
fun with lighting!</i>

15:35.000 --> 15:36.379
<i>When it comes
to your porch-</i>

15:36.379 --> 15:38.724
<i>what are the classics we
should be looking out for?</i>

15:38.724 --> 15:40.586
TV guest: <i>Yes, we want to
have some fun with lighting-</i>

15:40.586 --> 15:41.310
<i>in terms of aesthetics.</i>

15:42.310 --> 15:44.206
<i>But lighting that
is made for exteriors.</i>

15:44.206 --> 15:47.137
<i>Are you
ready for some fun?</i>

15:47.137 --> 15:50.931
<i>Let's count from
five backwards!</i>

15:52.344 --> 15:55.068
<i>Now here's something to
really get your mouth watering.</i>

15:55.068 --> 15:57.034
<i>Gourmet meatballs from scratch.</i>

15:57.034 --> 15:59.379
<i>No pasta required!</i>

15:59.379 --> 16:01.172
<i>These are plump,
juicy and delicious-</i>

16:01.172 --> 16:02.275
<i>all by themselves!</i>

16:03.206 --> 16:04.586
<i>I know you want
to try one now.</i>

16:04.586 --> 16:05.586
<i>But be patient.</i>

16:05.586 --> 16:08.172
<i>They taste even better
than they look.</i>

16:19.862 --> 16:20.965
So I'm guessing
you called me-

16:20.965 --> 16:22.620
because you're looking
for a new partner?

16:24.448 --> 16:25.586
Don't start, Mason.

16:26.448 --> 16:27.103
Will you sit down?

16:27.103 --> 16:28.103
You're making me nervous.

16:28.206 --> 16:28.793
Look.

16:30.862 --> 16:32.068
I need somebody-

16:32.068 --> 16:36.000
who can make some discreet
inquiries about Bruce Osgoode.

16:36.724 --> 16:37.931
Well I'm your man!

16:37.931 --> 16:39.344
You know I was
working for his ex-wife-

16:39.344 --> 16:41.827
just before their divorce
a couple years back?

16:41.827 --> 16:42.689
Interesting.

16:42.689 --> 16:43.655
Nah, not really.

16:43.655 --> 16:45.103
Just run of the
mill, you know?

16:45.724 --> 16:46.586
She thought he
was cheating.

16:46.586 --> 16:47.310
I couldn't find anything.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.827
She left him anyways.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.482
It's for the
best, because-

16:50.482 --> 16:51.310
he's not a
nice man.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.034
Ah.

16:52.034 --> 16:52.689
To her?

16:52.689 --> 16:53.482
No, to me!

16:54.620 --> 16:55.931
He caught me
tailing him-

16:55.931 --> 16:57.689
and put some
uniform cop on me.

16:57.689 --> 16:58.896
Some red-headed kid.

16:58.896 --> 17:01.758
I must've had like 50
traffic stops in two months.

17:01.758 --> 17:02.689
Wait a second.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.103
Osgoode was up to
something back then.

17:04.103 --> 17:05.689
He's up to
something now.

17:06.724 --> 17:07.517
<i>Whatever it was-</i>

17:07.517 --> 17:09.103
that alerted
Rex to him-

17:09.103 --> 17:10.482
it went out on that
gurney with him.

17:10.482 --> 17:11.620
Well listen.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.724
Don't worry, because
I've still got the old files.

17:12.724 --> 17:13.965
We'll get him.

17:14.068 --> 17:15.034
By the way-

17:15.034 --> 17:16.000
This is pro bono.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.000
But the client
picks up the tab.

17:19.000 --> 17:19.896
Mm-hmm.

17:21.379 --> 17:22.758
We're going to need
a couple of beers.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.379
What's the scenario?

17:30.103 --> 17:32.827
A visiting dignitary
in need of protection?

17:32.827 --> 17:33.517
Or-

17:34.620 --> 17:36.034
a saloon
in the Old West?

17:36.034 --> 17:37.586
There's no scenario.

17:37.586 --> 17:38.448
There's the target.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.206
You aim right there.

17:39.206 --> 17:40.000
<i>Oh right.</i>

17:40.000 --> 17:40.655
<i>Okay.</i>

17:40.655 --> 17:41.344
That's simple enough.

17:42.034 --> 17:43.034
Okay.

17:47.758 --> 17:49.862
I didn't expect that kind
of kickback from a handgun.

17:49.862 --> 17:50.827
Oh yeah.

17:50.827 --> 17:51.931
Same thing happened
to me my first time.

17:51.931 --> 17:52.793
You'll get there
with practice.

17:52.793 --> 17:54.137
Here can I just-

17:54.137 --> 17:55.793
can I adjust you?

17:55.793 --> 17:56.620
Like that?
- Yeah.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.793
Okay.

17:59.827 --> 18:00.517
Okay!

18:00.517 --> 18:01.482
That's better.

18:01.482 --> 18:02.758
You just need to get
a bit more central.

18:02.758 --> 18:04.103
I'm shooting to disarm.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.827
How's it going to stop him from
pressing the detonator, Jesse?

18:06.827 --> 18:07.965
You said no scenarios!

18:07.965 --> 18:10.137
You've got seconds
to stop him!

18:24.793 --> 18:26.551
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

18:26.551 --> 18:28.413
Junior Biathlon champ, 2015.

18:28.413 --> 18:29.655
It's like
riding a bike!

18:30.448 --> 18:31.655
So-

18:31.655 --> 18:33.206
so why has it taken you so long
to get your certification?

18:33.724 --> 18:34.862
Well, I mean targets
are one thing.

18:34.862 --> 18:35.517
But say I-

18:35.517 --> 18:36.482
get a gun.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.931
What if I have to
shoot it in real life?

18:37.931 --> 18:39.758
Oh yeah-no, I
felt the same way.

18:39.758 --> 18:40.620
How'd you
get through it?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.724
Uh-

18:41.724 --> 18:44.000
I read through police-
involved shooting reports.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.655
Yeah, replaced my
fears with facts.

18:46.206 --> 18:47.241
Hmm!

18:51.965 --> 18:53.137
Who is that kid?

18:56.206 --> 18:57.172
So-

18:57.172 --> 18:58.448
adultery cases, right?

18:59.551 --> 19:01.310
You're looking for
credit card charges-

19:01.310 --> 19:02.724
<i>and cash withdrawals.</i>

19:02.724 --> 19:05.137
I thought that Osgoode
wasn't cheating?

19:05.137 --> 19:06.172
No, he wasn't.

19:06.172 --> 19:07.793
And there was no
strange activity-

19:07.793 --> 19:09.034
in his regular accounts.

19:09.551 --> 19:10.758
What do you mean <i>
regular accounts</i>?

19:10.758 --> 19:12.793
<i>♪the subject of my
high school dreams♪</i>

19:12.793 --> 19:14.448
The guy had a secret
numbered account.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.758
He made big,
big deposits.

19:16.758 --> 19:17.689
Where did you
hear this?

19:17.689 --> 19:19.793
<i>♪My eyes were
taking it all in♪</i>

19:19.793 --> 19:21.517
The question you
should be asking is-

19:21.517 --> 19:23.482
where did the
money come from?

19:26.965 --> 19:29.793
Maybe it had something
to do with this.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.793
Look.

19:30.793 --> 19:32.103
Before Osgoode
was hero cop-

19:32.103 --> 19:33.620
he was the weakest
link in Narcotics.

19:33.620 --> 19:34.586
Lowest seizure rate.

19:34.586 --> 19:35.379
Mmmm.

19:36.413 --> 19:39.448
And he only seized drugs
with a low street value.

19:40.068 --> 19:41.000
Hmm!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.655
You think Osgoode
was taking bribes-

19:42.655 --> 19:44.241
to look the other
way on bigger stuff?

19:44.241 --> 19:46.413
That would explain the
money in his secret account.

19:46.413 --> 19:47.344
You know, I
know someone-

19:47.344 --> 19:49.413
that might have a
thing to say about this.

19:49.413 --> 19:50.965
We'll talk to
them tomorrow.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.724
There they are.

20:05.344 --> 20:06.172
Be right back.

20:14.137 --> 20:14.793
Hey.

20:14.896 --> 20:15.586
Whoah whoah whoah!

20:16.413 --> 20:17.275
<i>Watch out!</i>

20:17.275 --> 20:17.931
<i>Hey.</i>

20:17.931 --> 20:18.655
<i>Miss me already?</i>

20:19.551 --> 20:21.172
I want ears
on this.

20:21.172 --> 20:21.862
Got it.

20:26.379 --> 20:27.034
<i>Ace!</i>

20:27.034 --> 20:27.758
What are you saying?

20:27.758 --> 20:28.448
What up man?

20:28.448 --> 20:29.137
<i>How are you doing?</i>

20:29.689 --> 20:30.482
<i>Hey listen.</i>

20:30.482 --> 20:31.758
<i>Can you help me
with something?</i>

20:31.758 --> 20:33.137
<i>I need a fuller
understanding-</i>

20:33.137 --> 20:33.862
<i>of a guy-</i>

20:33.862 --> 20:35.034
<i>Officer Bruce Osgoode.</i>

20:35.034 --> 20:35.965
You ever run
into him?

20:35.965 --> 20:36.758
<i>Of course.</i>

20:36.758 --> 20:37.931
<i>Narcotics cop
he used to be.</i>

20:37.931 --> 20:38.793
Yeah, he ever
bust you?

20:38.793 --> 20:39.482
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:39.482 --> 20:40.206
He was cool though.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.068
He always
let me go.

20:41.068 --> 20:41.758
<i>What?</i>

20:42.448 --> 20:43.172
No charges?

20:43.793 --> 20:45.137
What did that
cost you?

20:45.137 --> 20:46.068
<i>Osgoode didn't
ask for money.</i>

20:46.068 --> 20:46.931
He'd take my stash-

20:46.931 --> 20:48.482
and like tell me
to go back to school-

20:48.482 --> 20:50.000
<i>or some such nonsense.</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:52.137
Why did you get
special treatment?

20:52.137 --> 20:53.344
<i>Not just me.</i>

20:53.344 --> 20:54.551
We all knew
the deal.

20:54.551 --> 20:55.517
He busts you-

20:55.517 --> 20:56.793
you give up
your inventory.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.620
That's just the way it worked
when Osgoode was on the street.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.310
<i>Mmm yeah.</i>

20:59.310 --> 21:00.241
<i>Okay, all right!</i>

21:00.241 --> 21:01.310
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

21:01.310 --> 21:02.862
Bingo.

21:06.793 --> 21:08.172
Sounds like Osgoode
was seizing drugs-

21:08.172 --> 21:10.793
without making arrests
or logging evidence-

21:10.793 --> 21:12.241
so that he could sell
the goods himself.

21:12.241 --> 21:14.448
I guess that's where the money
in his secret account came from.

21:14.448 --> 21:15.896
Ace seemed
cool with it.

21:15.896 --> 21:17.448
Maybe Luke Pearson
didn't like it.

21:17.448 --> 21:19.724
Hey you think that's how Osgoode
found himself in that shoot-out?

21:19.724 --> 21:20.379
Yeah yeah.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.379
Could be.

21:21.379 --> 21:22.793
I wish we could talk
to one of Luke's men.

21:22.793 --> 21:23.931
But Osgoode
killed them all.

21:23.931 --> 21:24.724
Wait a minute.

21:25.655 --> 21:26.620
Luke had a sister.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.000
Uh-Zoey.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.931
Maybe she'll
talk to us.

21:29.655 --> 21:30.379
Hmm.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.413
Really?

21:34.344 --> 21:35.379
Your other partner
eat your leftovers?

21:36.206 --> 21:36.931
Uh- sorry.

21:36.931 --> 21:37.620
Force of habit.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.103
<i>Hey.</i>

21:41.103 --> 21:41.758
Sergeant Barry.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.413
<i>Tactical.</i>

21:42.413 --> 21:43.379
<i>Jackson.</i>

21:43.379 --> 21:44.655
This is the kid I
was telling you about.

21:44.655 --> 21:45.310
Hi.

21:45.310 --> 21:46.000
This guy?

21:46.000 --> 21:46.655
Yeah!

21:46.655 --> 21:47.379
Right?

21:47.379 --> 21:48.034
Yeah hey hey.

21:48.034 --> 21:49.000
Show him
what you got.

21:49.000 --> 21:49.793
Okay!

21:51.896 --> 21:52.689
Whenever you're ready.

22:08.965 --> 22:09.586
You're SJPD?

22:09.586 --> 22:10.551
Yeah.

22:10.551 --> 22:12.172
Special Constable Jesse Mills.

22:12.172 --> 22:13.241
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:13.241 --> 22:15.172
<i>He wandered in over from
a desk at Major Crimes.</i>

22:15.172 --> 22:16.241
Here, come over
and try this.

22:21.413 --> 22:22.137
Three shots.

22:22.862 --> 22:23.931
One, four and five.

22:24.172 --> 22:25.000
Okay.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.068
Alexa, drop
in at home.

22:48.793 --> 22:50.379
<i>Okay, dropping in.</i>

22:52.172 --> 22:52.827
Rex, it's okay.

22:52.827 --> 22:53.793
I'll be there soon.

23:02.793 --> 23:04.137
<i>You boys
looking for haircuts?</i>

23:04.896 --> 23:07.275
Actually we were hoping to talk
to you about Bruce Osgoode.

23:07.275 --> 23:08.448
Oh.

23:08.448 --> 23:09.655
The guy who killed
my brother?

23:09.655 --> 23:11.103
I hear he's
on a book tour.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.034
Um, listen.

23:13.034 --> 23:15.379
Do you know if your brother
and Osgoode talked-

23:15.379 --> 23:16.206
before the shooting?

23:17.586 --> 23:19.241
Luke didn't talk to
me about his business.

23:19.241 --> 23:20.379
I stay clean.

23:20.379 --> 23:21.103
Cut hair.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.586
Doesn't look like
you have any clients.

23:24.344 --> 23:25.586
What're you suggesting?

23:25.586 --> 23:26.724
<i>We're not here to talk
about your business, Zoey.</i>

23:26.724 --> 23:28.724
I just want to know if
you'd heard anything.

23:29.172 --> 23:32.068
A dispute maybe between
your brother and Osgoode-

23:32.068 --> 23:33.068
about territory or product?

23:33.068 --> 23:34.620
I didn't hear
about nothing.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.241
Luke didn't talk to me
about his work okay?

23:36.241 --> 23:37.655
<i>And look.</i>

23:37.655 --> 23:38.379
If narcotics cops-

23:38.379 --> 23:39.344
rolled up here-

23:39.344 --> 23:41.275
and Luke decided
to start shooting-

23:41.275 --> 23:42.827
he only had his own
stupid self to blame.

23:42.827 --> 23:43.517
Don't you think?

23:47.758 --> 23:49.413
That salon is a front
if I've ever seen one.

23:49.413 --> 23:50.448
Yeah.

23:50.448 --> 23:51.724
But why protect the guy
who killed your brother?

23:52.034 --> 23:52.793
Hey look.

23:52.793 --> 23:53.482
I'll tail Osgoode.

23:53.482 --> 23:54.586
See what I
can dig up.

23:54.586 --> 23:55.275
Mmm.

23:55.275 --> 23:55.965
All right.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
<i>Rex?</i>

24:42.103 --> 24:43.137
How are you doing?

24:45.827 --> 24:47.413
Oh, Rex!

24:50.896 --> 24:52.758
Ohhh!

24:54.448 --> 24:57.137
<i>You are having
a rough go, huh?</i>

24:58.517 --> 25:00.068
You're worried about what
Charlie's going to say?

25:01.965 --> 25:02.862
Hmmm.

25:10.482 --> 25:11.551
Well I won't tell
if you don't.

25:14.068 --> 25:15.034
And you want treats?

25:17.103 --> 25:17.896
Rex!

25:19.172 --> 25:20.413
Did you eat
the rest?

25:20.517 --> 25:22.103
<i>Okay, fair enough.</i>

25:22.103 --> 25:24.241
<i>I guess you are
having a rough day.</i>

25:25.241 --> 25:25.862
<i>Okay.</i>

25:25.862 --> 25:26.724
<i>Alexa.</i>

25:26.724 --> 25:29.000
Add dog treats
to my shopping list.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.482
<i>Okay, I'll add dog
treats to your shopping list.</i>

25:32.482 --> 25:33.172
Oh.

25:34.103 --> 25:35.344
I'm sorry Rex.

25:38.758 --> 25:39.413
Reel him in!

25:44.482 --> 25:46.344
Am I interrupting anything?

25:47.206 --> 25:49.000
Your timing's
impeccable, actually.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.551
Word's going around that you're
looking at Bruce Osgoode.

25:53.310 --> 25:54.103
Okay look.

25:54.482 --> 25:55.448
You said this
whole thing-

25:55.448 --> 25:56.655
would be playing out
a lot differently-

25:56.655 --> 25:57.793
if it weren't for
Osgoode's reputation.

25:57.793 --> 25:58.862
His reputation is
smoke and mirrors.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.517
<i>Your little
investigation-</i>

26:00.517 --> 26:02.586
isn't going to get
Rex reinstated.

26:02.586 --> 26:05.586
But it could have real
blowback on the K9 team.

26:05.586 --> 26:06.275
Tell him-

26:06.275 --> 26:07.103
<i>Donovan.</i>

26:08.586 --> 26:10.275
Renley I think you
need to give us the room.

26:12.413 --> 26:13.068
Please.

26:18.482 --> 26:19.793
Fix it Joe.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.344
<i>Have a seat.</i>

26:27.551 --> 26:28.931
<i>What have you
got for me Charlie?</i>

26:29.482 --> 26:31.482
I think Osgoode was seizing
drugs on the street-

26:31.482 --> 26:32.275
to re-sell himself.

26:32.724 --> 26:33.448
Do you have proof?

26:33.448 --> 26:34.448
<i>Well I have
a dealer-</i>

26:34.448 --> 26:35.862
who said that he used
to confiscate product-

26:35.862 --> 26:36.586
without laying charges.

26:37.448 --> 26:38.310
That's not enough.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.517
Then I'll find more.

26:46.448 --> 26:47.655
Okay, but be discreet.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.275
We do not need to
raise any alarms on this.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.137
<i>Go on.</i>

26:52.793 --> 26:53.620
Thanks.

27:37.793 --> 27:38.586
Charlie.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.862
I ran Osgoode's financials.

27:39.862 --> 27:41.448
Jesse, I told you
to stay out of this.

27:41.448 --> 27:42.482
Yeah well Joe
told me different.

27:42.482 --> 27:43.448
And he outranks you.

27:45.241 --> 27:46.620
Well in that case,
what have you got?

27:46.620 --> 27:47.689
The guy is a
big spender.

27:47.689 --> 27:49.275
Way more than his
department pension.

27:49.275 --> 27:51.724
What about all the money
from his speaking engagements-

27:51.724 --> 27:52.413
and book deal?

27:52.413 --> 27:53.620
Book sales were mediocre.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.517
I mean, he could have hired
a ghostwriter to be honest.

27:56.620 --> 27:58.379
Well he can't still be
selling and seizing drugs-

27:58.379 --> 27:59.655
<i>since he's been retired.</i>

28:01.379 --> 28:02.379
Where's all the
money coming from?

28:02.379 --> 28:03.448
<i>Mason, what
have you got?</i>

28:03.448 --> 28:04.517
<i>Charlie, drop
what you're doing.</i>

28:04.517 --> 28:05.896
<i>I need you to come
meet me, man.</i>

28:05.896 --> 28:07.034
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

28:10.448 --> 28:11.448
<i>Sergeant Barry!</i>

28:12.172 --> 28:13.137
What are you
doing here?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.896
I want you to join
the SWAT team.

28:16.655 --> 28:17.275
Me?

28:17.275 --> 28:18.103
<i>Yeah!</i>

28:18.103 --> 28:19.758
Surprised the hell
out of me too.

28:19.758 --> 28:20.655
But you're
a crack shot.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.379
We'll work
on the rest.

28:23.172 --> 28:24.206
Wow, um-

28:24.724 --> 28:26.275
okay, I-

28:26.275 --> 28:27.172
Look I don't know-

28:27.172 --> 28:28.413
how comfortable I
am shooting people.

28:28.413 --> 28:29.448
<i>That's not what
SWAT is about.</i>

28:29.448 --> 28:30.724
We use guns, sure.

28:31.103 --> 28:32.206
But only as
a last resort.

28:33.103 --> 28:33.862
Think about it.

28:33.862 --> 28:34.689
Okay?

28:34.689 --> 28:35.379
Yeah.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.586
Ooh.

28:37.586 --> 28:38.275
<i>You saw
Osgoode here?</i>

28:38.896 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, trying
to get in.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.931
Listen.

28:40.931 --> 28:42.241
Why come back to the
scene of the attack?

28:42.896 --> 28:43.551
<i>Sorry.</i>

28:43.551 --> 28:44.241
Sorry Rex.

28:44.241 --> 28:45.172
Alleged attack?

28:46.379 --> 28:48.689
Well I assumed that if Rex
alerted to drugs on Osgoode-

28:48.689 --> 28:49.586
he took them
with him.

28:49.586 --> 28:50.793
But what if
he didn't?

28:50.793 --> 28:52.413
Ohhh!

28:52.413 --> 28:54.241
So you think he might have
dropped them in there?

28:54.241 --> 28:55.655
Well it's the only
way to assure-

28:55.655 --> 28:56.689
he wouldn't get
caught with drugs.

28:56.689 --> 28:58.137
And then he
accuses Rex-

28:58.137 --> 28:59.827
<i>so that he doesn't
get close again.</i>

28:59.827 --> 29:01.620
Must be really jonesing
if he's considering-

29:01.620 --> 29:03.000
<i>breaking into a school.</i>

29:03.000 --> 29:04.448
But he didn't
get in again, huh?

29:05.172 --> 29:05.896
Can't see why not.

29:07.827 --> 29:08.620
Oh man!

29:08.620 --> 29:09.965
Maybe that's why, Mason.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.517
You better go
before the cops come.

29:14.724 --> 29:15.689
<i>Ughh.</i>

29:19.862 --> 29:20.482
Find it!

29:20.482 --> 29:21.172
Now.

29:26.827 --> 29:28.241
You got something?

29:33.034 --> 29:33.724
Yeah.

29:33.724 --> 29:34.413
I see it.

29:52.965 --> 29:53.758
Fentanyl.

29:54.413 --> 29:55.206
You got it pal.

29:55.206 --> 29:55.896
<i>Hey.</i>

29:56.896 --> 29:57.862
They're almost here.

29:58.517 --> 29:59.206
I'll deal with them.

29:59.206 --> 30:00.068
Get Rex
out of here.

30:00.068 --> 30:00.965
All right, come on boy!

30:25.275 --> 30:27.137
Hey!

30:29.482 --> 30:30.620
It's not what
it looks like.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.620
I should hope not.

30:32.655 --> 30:33.310
What is this?

30:36.275 --> 30:37.862
Pharmaceutical-grade
fentanyl patches.

30:37.862 --> 30:39.172
Where did
you find them?

30:39.172 --> 30:40.275
<i>At the school.</i>

30:40.275 --> 30:41.862
Osgoode must have had
these on him the other day.

30:41.862 --> 30:43.931
That's why Rex reacted
so strongly to him.

30:44.448 --> 30:45.206
Oh right.

30:46.413 --> 30:47.758
Rex's last encounter with
fentanyl almost killed him.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.655
I mean, he was probably trying
to protect the students, too.

30:50.827 --> 30:52.517
You think Osgoode could
have been prescribed these-

30:52.517 --> 30:53.620
for personal use?

30:53.620 --> 30:54.827
Uh- not likely.

30:54.827 --> 30:56.482
These are the highest
dose available.

30:56.482 --> 30:58.103
<i>They're usually used
for end-of-life care.</i>

30:58.103 --> 30:59.000
Mmm.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.482
Well I want to know
where he got them.

31:00.482 --> 31:01.413
You'll tag them
for prints?

31:01.413 --> 31:02.137
Yeah!

31:02.241 --> 31:02.965
You're the best.

31:04.689 --> 31:05.448
Come on Rex.

31:05.793 --> 31:07.241
I bet you make
a great wing man.

31:11.275 --> 31:12.896
<i>Is this still about
the ice cream?</i>

31:15.172 --> 31:16.172
This is extortion,
you know?

31:18.689 --> 31:19.517
Here you go buddy.

31:22.551 --> 31:23.482
Okay okay okay.

31:24.551 --> 31:25.379
How do I look?

31:25.896 --> 31:26.827
Yeah.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.137
Ladies!

31:30.000 --> 31:30.793
How are you doing?

31:32.068 --> 31:33.241
<i>This is my
friend Rex.</i>

31:38.413 --> 31:39.689
Charlie.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.724
I've been looking into reports
from police-involved shootings.

31:41.724 --> 31:42.413
Uh-huh?

31:42.413 --> 31:43.068
Personal interest.

31:43.068 --> 31:43.827
Don't worry about it.

31:43.827 --> 31:45.482
But I looked into
one report-

31:45.482 --> 31:46.896
from the Osgoode-
Pearson shooting.

31:46.896 --> 31:49.724
And it doesn't track with
the story from Osgoode's book.

31:49.724 --> 31:51.000
How so?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.620
We know that Osgoode was the
only officer on the scene right?

31:52.620 --> 31:53.758
Yeah, famously so.

31:53.758 --> 31:54.793
One against three.

31:54.793 --> 31:56.586
He shot each lieutenant
with one single shot.

31:56.586 --> 31:58.413
But Luke Pearson
was shot three times.

31:58.413 --> 32:00.413
Twice from
this angle here.

32:00.413 --> 32:02.068
Same direction the
lieutenants were shot from.

32:02.068 --> 32:04.344
Yeah but it was the third
bullet that killed Pearson.

32:04.344 --> 32:05.551
And that was from
a different angle.

32:07.103 --> 32:08.551
Osgoode moved
while he was firing?

32:08.551 --> 32:09.448
He was shot-

32:09.448 --> 32:10.793
in the back by
one of the lieutenants.

32:10.793 --> 32:11.793
And at that point-

32:11.793 --> 32:13.413
according to his book-

32:13.413 --> 32:14.275
he was unable
to move.

32:15.482 --> 32:19.068
But don't ballistics of all
three shots match his gun?

32:19.068 --> 32:20.586
One of the bullets
was never recovered.

32:21.379 --> 32:22.931
Osgoode had an accomplice.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.862
But who was it?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.275
I might be able
to help with that.

32:26.275 --> 32:28.862
I got two sets of fingerprints
from the fentanyl patches.

32:28.862 --> 32:30.275
Osgoode and-?

32:30.275 --> 32:31.000
Walt Neville.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.241
He's an active officer.

32:33.931 --> 32:34.931
That's exactly how
Bruce stays flush.

32:34.931 --> 32:36.551
<i>He's still moving drugs.</i>

32:36.551 --> 32:38.793
<i>But he's having
Neville seize them now!</i>

32:38.793 --> 32:39.586
Wait.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.068
I think I was there for
the fentanyl handoff.

32:45.206 --> 32:46.034
You must be
tired, buddy.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.068
<i>I'll take it
from here.</i>

32:47.068 --> 32:48.586
Nice chatting
with you kid.

32:50.482 --> 32:51.344
Can I have
a book?

32:51.724 --> 32:52.379
Thanks.

32:53.827 --> 32:56.551
<i>I think that's the guy
Osgoode set on Mason years ago.</i>

32:56.655 --> 32:57.413
Jesse send
me that info.

32:57.413 --> 32:58.793
I'm going to have
a word with him.

32:58.793 --> 32:59.448
Yeah.

32:59.448 --> 33:00.310
Hey.

33:01.034 --> 33:01.965
Great work!

33:03.137 --> 33:03.827
<i>See?</i>

33:03.827 --> 33:05.620
The shooting
reports are key.

33:06.758 --> 33:08.206
I've been putting
in some extra time-

33:08.206 --> 33:09.241
at the range too.

33:09.241 --> 33:10.034
Hmmm!

33:10.034 --> 33:10.965
With the SWAT team.

33:12.172 --> 33:15.275
<i>With the SWAT team?</i>

33:17.896 --> 33:19.000
With the SWAT team?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.586
They want me
to join them.

33:23.482 --> 33:25.275
Are you considering it?

33:26.655 --> 33:27.724
I mean look.

33:27.724 --> 33:29.620
I'm sure you guys can
find someone else to-

33:30.482 --> 33:32.034
run your web searches.

33:32.034 --> 33:33.620
But none of us think
that's all you do!

33:33.620 --> 33:34.931
Jesse, you're indispensable!

33:34.931 --> 33:36.793
You just blew this
case wide open!

33:40.931 --> 33:42.931
You've been seizing
drugs from dealers-

33:42.931 --> 33:44.620
<i>and giving them to
Bruce Osgoode to sell.</i>

33:45.379 --> 33:46.275
Is that so?

33:46.965 --> 33:47.758
Prove it.

33:47.758 --> 33:48.827
Ah, we've got
your fingerprints-

33:48.827 --> 33:50.344
all over a bag of
fentanyl patches-

33:50.344 --> 33:51.931
<i>we found at
the school.</i>

33:51.931 --> 33:53.862
Yeah I'm curious how
he talked you into it.

33:53.862 --> 33:55.827
It seems to me you're
taking the bigger risks.

33:56.827 --> 33:57.517
How do you figure?

33:57.517 --> 33:58.275
<i>Osgoode-</i>

33:58.275 --> 33:59.482
doesn't have a
department job-

33:59.482 --> 34:00.275
to protect anymore.

34:00.275 --> 34:02.586
<i>No kids, no wife.</i>

34:05.206 --> 34:06.517
God, my wife's
going to kill me.

34:06.517 --> 34:08.034
<i>We're the ones-</i>

34:08.034 --> 34:10.068
that put our lives
on the line-

34:10.068 --> 34:11.103
while drug dealers
are getting rich.

34:11.103 --> 34:11.758
The system is-

34:11.758 --> 34:12.413
<i>Stop!</i>

34:12.413 --> 34:13.103
<i>Just stop.</i>

34:13.103 --> 34:14.344
That is the
same excuse-

34:14.344 --> 34:15.862
that every corrupt
cop tries to peddle.

34:15.862 --> 34:16.931
What, did Osgoode
teach you that?

34:18.206 --> 34:21.517
<i>Did he start with something like
a dime bag here and there-</i>

34:21.517 --> 34:23.137
<i>it only hurts the
scumbag dealer?</i>

34:23.137 --> 34:24.275
And before
you know it-

34:24.275 --> 34:26.034
you're helping him
kill Luke Pearson.

34:26.034 --> 34:26.724
Accomplice to murder.

34:26.724 --> 34:27.827
Wait now!

34:27.827 --> 34:29.689
I know that you're mad
at Osgoode about your dog!

34:29.689 --> 34:31.000
<i>But that's taking
it too far!</i>

34:31.000 --> 34:32.551
I don't believe
Osgoode was ambushed.

34:32.551 --> 34:33.586
I think he
made the move-

34:33.586 --> 34:34.310
on Pearson!

34:34.310 --> 34:35.172
For what?

34:35.172 --> 34:36.241
<i>To keep them
from retaliating?</i>

34:36.241 --> 34:37.275
Take over
his turf?

34:37.275 --> 34:38.482
You tell me!

34:38.482 --> 34:39.482
There was a
second shooter!

34:39.482 --> 34:40.379
Was that you?

34:40.379 --> 34:41.551
I wasn't there!

34:41.551 --> 34:43.172
<i>Right now
I have you-</i>

34:43.172 --> 34:44.586
for supplying drugs
to Bruce Osgoode-

34:44.586 --> 34:45.931
for doing traffic stops-

34:45.931 --> 34:47.482
on somebody he
wanted off his tail.

34:47.482 --> 34:48.344
<i>I would have
no problem-</i>

34:48.344 --> 34:49.655
going upstairs
right now-

34:49.655 --> 34:50.862
and convincing them
you're his errand boy-

34:50.862 --> 34:52.068
<i>doing whatever
he told you to do!</i>

34:52.068 --> 34:52.931
Not for what
you're saying!

34:52.931 --> 34:53.586
Not for murder!

34:53.586 --> 34:54.586
Then tell me who!

34:56.793 --> 34:57.448
Listen.

34:57.448 --> 34:58.482
You've got
to help me.

35:02.172 --> 35:03.034
Zoey Pearson.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.241
His side hustle back
then was with her.

35:04.241 --> 35:05.206
Not me.

35:06.586 --> 35:07.931
Why would Zoey
betray her brother?

35:07.931 --> 35:09.344
She wanted in
on the business.

35:09.344 --> 35:11.965
<i>Luke just saw her
as his kid sister.</i>

35:11.965 --> 35:13.896
Wouldn't give her
any power in the crew.

35:13.896 --> 35:16.034
Osgoode told her
what she wanted to hear.

35:16.034 --> 35:17.206
Made her a partner.

35:17.206 --> 35:20.068
And that's why she took his
side when I talked to her.

35:20.068 --> 35:20.724
<i>Wait.</i>

35:20.724 --> 35:21.413
You talked to her?

35:21.413 --> 35:22.103
When?

35:22.965 --> 35:23.758
Today.

35:25.172 --> 35:26.655
Zoey called earlier.

35:26.655 --> 35:28.586
Asked- is Osgoode
becoming a liability?

35:28.586 --> 35:29.965
<i>I didn't know what
she was on about.</i>

35:29.965 --> 35:30.793
<i>But now-</i>

35:30.793 --> 35:31.655
<i>Listen.</i>

35:31.655 --> 35:32.517
I know I
screwed up.

35:32.517 --> 35:33.758
But I'm
still a cop.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.482
If you go after
her, be prepared.

35:35.482 --> 35:36.689
<i>Zoey's dangerous.</i>

35:36.689 --> 35:38.241
<i>If she figures out
that you're on to her-</i>

35:38.241 --> 35:39.655
about the shooting-

35:39.655 --> 35:40.379
watch out.

35:41.758 --> 35:43.068
Mason, I need Rex.

35:44.551 --> 35:45.379
Yeah yeah yeah.

35:45.862 --> 35:46.965
<i>Okay, on our way.</i>

35:49.620 --> 35:50.862
<i>There you go buddy.</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:52.482
Yeah.

36:21.379 --> 36:22.517
Drop the gun, Zoey.

36:22.517 --> 36:23.758
I'm here to
bring him in.

36:23.758 --> 36:24.620
<i>Everyone-</i>

36:24.620 --> 36:27.379
just needs
to calm down.

36:27.379 --> 36:28.517
Bring him in
for what?

36:30.827 --> 36:31.896
For killing Luke.

36:33.137 --> 36:34.344
Yeah I want to
see him pay-

36:35.482 --> 36:36.758
for what he did
to your family.

36:39.551 --> 36:40.517
A little late
for that.

36:40.517 --> 36:41.379
<i>Don't you think?</i>

36:41.379 --> 36:42.413
I guess when I
found the fentanyl-

36:42.413 --> 36:44.344
<i>that you hid when
Rex sniffed you out-</i>

36:44.344 --> 36:46.275
<i>you were high when you
went down the stairs-</i>

36:46.275 --> 36:46.931
<i>which is why-</i>

36:46.931 --> 36:47.793
you left the hospital.

36:47.793 --> 36:48.724
Look Zoey.

36:50.172 --> 36:51.275
I don't care
about you.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.275
I'm here to
arrest Osgoode.

36:54.034 --> 36:55.551
You're never going to let
me just walk after this.

37:11.379 --> 37:12.137
Give me a second.

37:12.241 --> 37:13.000
Give me a second.

37:13.758 --> 37:14.862
I'll get this open.

37:18.000 --> 37:18.827
What are you
doing there?

37:18.827 --> 37:19.517
Shhhh!

37:20.137 --> 37:21.586
I am calling
the police!

37:21.586 --> 37:22.655
<i>Yeah,
ask for Major Crimes!</i>

37:33.620 --> 37:34.827
What on earth-?

37:34.931 --> 37:35.586
Rex!

37:39.103 --> 37:41.172
Nobody's going to
hold this against you.

37:41.172 --> 37:42.758
<i>Osgoode killed your brother.</i>

37:42.758 --> 37:44.000
Look, the way
that I see it-

37:44.000 --> 37:46.344
is that you came
here to confront him.

37:46.344 --> 37:47.793
It's understandable-

37:47.793 --> 37:49.000
if you put
the gun down-

37:49.000 --> 37:49.931
now.

37:49.931 --> 37:51.551
Not going to
happen, Detective.

37:51.551 --> 37:52.275
I can prove-

37:52.275 --> 37:53.827
that Osgoode
was a dirty cop-

37:53.827 --> 37:55.241
who murdered his rivals.

37:55.344 --> 37:57.034
<i>He even lured
a young officer-</i>

37:57.034 --> 37:57.896
into helping him out.

37:57.896 --> 37:59.724
You know that
Neville respected you?

37:59.724 --> 38:01.172
<i>That's until you turned
him into a killer-</i>

38:01.172 --> 38:02.517
<i>for shooting her brother.</i>

38:02.620 --> 38:04.137
Don't listen
to him, Zoey.

38:04.137 --> 38:05.344
If I go down,
you do too.

38:05.344 --> 38:06.379
You know this.

38:06.379 --> 38:08.413
Shut up, Bruce!

38:08.413 --> 38:09.275
Both of you-

38:09.413 --> 38:11.241
Sit down now!

38:11.241 --> 38:11.931
<i>Sit!</i>

38:11.931 --> 38:12.862
<i>I just-</i>

38:12.862 --> 38:15.068
<i>I just need a second
to think okay?</i>

38:15.068 --> 38:16.068
<i>I just-</i>

38:16.068 --> 38:16.758
<i>um-</i>

38:19.482 --> 38:20.172
Rex!

39:08.172 --> 39:10.896
<i>Um-</i>

39:10.896 --> 39:12.586
I wasn't always a
bad cop you know.

39:12.586 --> 39:14.000
Save it for
your next book.

39:14.551 --> 39:15.206
<i>Bruce.</i>

39:16.310 --> 39:17.310
What the- ?

39:17.310 --> 39:18.000
Stay back!

39:34.724 --> 39:35.655
Yeah she's still alive.

39:35.655 --> 39:36.689
Call an ambulance.

39:39.931 --> 39:40.862
<i>No.</i>

39:40.862 --> 39:42.000
<i>Come on Hudson.</i>

39:42.000 --> 39:44.137
<i>I don't think
so pal.</i>

39:44.137 --> 39:45.862
Okay yeah,
I get it.

39:47.241 --> 39:48.689
You shoot me
with Zoey's gun-

39:48.689 --> 39:50.068
so she's the one
who killed the cop.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.137
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:51.137 --> 39:53.172
And my gun's the gun
that killed the cop-killer.

39:53.689 --> 39:54.862
You think this
is my first rodeo?

39:55.103 --> 39:56.655
Make sure you get your
position right this time.

39:57.517 --> 39:58.344
<i>My team-</i>

39:58.344 --> 39:59.551
is going to know
to check your story.

40:01.551 --> 40:04.034
<i>Hey did Rex really
jump you at the school?</i>

40:04.034 --> 40:05.275
Or did he just
alert to you-

40:05.275 --> 40:06.413
like he was
supposed to do?

40:06.413 --> 40:08.034
<i>And then you stepped
backwards off the stairs-</i>

40:08.034 --> 40:09.551
<i>so he wouldn't
expose you.</i>

40:09.551 --> 40:11.482
I was so high, I
didn't even feel it.

40:15.241 --> 40:15.931
Ughh!

40:20.827 --> 40:22.172
<i>You feel that?</i>

40:22.172 --> 40:23.034
That's what
it feels like-

40:23.034 --> 40:24.103
when Rex really
attacks you.

40:29.172 --> 40:30.344
Somebody call
for back-up?

40:33.172 --> 40:35.172
You're under arrest for the
murder of your brother.

40:35.172 --> 40:36.551
Wait- I'm the
victim here!

40:36.551 --> 40:37.482
You said so yourself!

40:37.482 --> 40:38.413
Zoey.

40:38.413 --> 40:39.862
<i>I know you were
the second shooter.</i>

40:39.862 --> 40:40.517
It was Osgoode.

40:40.517 --> 40:41.620
He made
me do it!

40:41.620 --> 40:42.482
<i>He forced me into it!</i>

40:42.482 --> 40:43.172
Uh-huh.

40:49.482 --> 40:50.172
My man.

40:50.172 --> 40:50.896
Nice work, partner.

40:52.000 --> 40:52.655
<i>Okay.</i>

40:52.655 --> 40:53.379
<i>So now I see-</i>

40:53.379 --> 40:55.482
where I
stand here!

40:55.482 --> 40:57.172
You and Rex
saved my life today.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.793
Which kind of means
you owe me one?

40:59.586 --> 41:00.413
I've got a
date tonight.

41:00.413 --> 41:01.655
And I was thinking
of borrowing Rex.

41:01.655 --> 41:02.896
Absolutely not.

41:06.310 --> 41:07.379
Ma'am, are
you all right?

41:07.379 --> 41:09.275
I was just uh-

41:09.379 --> 41:10.310
<i>And then-</i>

41:11.310 --> 41:11.931
And bang!

41:11.931 --> 41:13.965
And then I'm just-

41:13.965 --> 41:14.965
Okay okay.

41:14.965 --> 41:16.034
Let's get you
sitting down okay?

41:16.137 --> 41:16.896
Here.

41:17.379 --> 41:18.068
Here.

41:21.241 --> 41:23.172
