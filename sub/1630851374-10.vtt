where you've really been?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.116
I already told you, Mom.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.944
I was hiking
the Appalachian Trail.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.772
First of all,

09:58.815 --> 10:00.774
I haven't seen you so much
as hike up a driveway.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.297
Second of all, the
Appalachian Trail

10:02.340 --> 10:04.560
runs from Georgia to Maine,
but yet somehow you ended up

10:04.604 --> 10:06.040
in South Bend.
Try again.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.694
Slowdown reported ahead.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.653
Oh, my God. I got separated
from the group. And it--

10:10.697 --> 10:12.699
Mom, it's a long story.
I don't--

10:12.742 --> 10:14.831
I'm not doing this right now.
I...

10:14.875 --> 10:16.833
I just need to get home.What home?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.443
[sighs]I went to your apartment.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.489
Someone else is living there.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.405
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance

10:23.448 --> 10:25.059
to tell me
what the hell is going on.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.538
There's nothing going on!

10:26.582 --> 10:28.236
Then why are cops
showing up at my door,

10:28.279 --> 10:30.107
telling me you're
involved in a murder case?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.153
So cut the crap!

10:35.330 --> 10:37.680
I don't know.
That I don't know about. I...

10:37.724 --> 10:40.683
I don't know what that is, Mom.
I swear.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.033
Okay, Murphy.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.601
You're lying to me, and
I'm not driving another inch

10:45.645 --> 10:47.124
until you tell me
what's going on.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.300
What are you doing?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.562
Are you...?

10:51.999 --> 10:53.565
MURPHY:
You're actually insane.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.742
What are you doing?
I don't have time for this.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.700
JOY [laughing]:
Oh, 'cause
your schedule's so busy?

10:57.744 --> 11:02.009
Just drive!No. Not until you tell me
what's really going on!

11:02.052 --> 11:05.708
[phone buzzing]

11:05.752 --> 11:07.449
Hey.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.931
SARAH:
Hey, look, I got your texts
and everything. I...

11:10.974 --> 11:12.541
I can't do this.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.804
Come on. Sarah,
I said I was sorry.

11:14.848 --> 11:18.068
I'd get fired if anyone found
out what happened, and I...

11:18.112 --> 11:19.853
Okay, but who am I gonna tell?

11:19.896 --> 11:23.726
Darnell, I like you--
I think that's pretty clear--

11:23.770 --> 11:25.859
but we both know
that this is a bad idea.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.732
I just... I can't do this.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.128
Well...

11:34.171 --> 11:36.347
I guess you know where to find
me if you change your mind?

11:36.391 --> 11:38.915
Yeah. I'll see you.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.271
Oh.

11:49.621 --> 11:53.103
Want some food?
I got enough for you.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.539
How could I eat,

11:54.583 --> 11:56.150
knowing the cops think
I killed three people?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.891
[scoffs]

11:57.934 --> 12:01.938
I told you, Cindy could hook you
up with a whole new identity.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.593
Yeah? Then what?

12:04.636 --> 12:07.291
Start over.
Do whatever you want.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.206
But I didn't just
ruin things with Sarah

12:09.250 --> 12:11.818
so you could sit on my couch
playing video games forever.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.907
Ruin things?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.213
You only slept with her once.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.259
Yeah.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.611
Fine. Whatever.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.353
I'll go see Cindy
after I beat this level.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.187
Mm...
Anything?

12:33.230 --> 12:36.538
I understand about every fifth
word in this book, so... no.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.279
[exhales]

12:40.890 --> 12:42.805
Okay, why didn't you guys just
call the cops

12:42.849 --> 12:45.025
and claim self-defense?FELIX:Well,

12:45.068 --> 12:47.201
look who came crawling back.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.769
No, I just... I couldn't
pay attention in this meeting

12:49.812 --> 12:52.989
because your stupidity was
bothering me, and so, just...

12:53.033 --> 12:54.861
Why didn't you claim
self-defense?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.646
Because they were trafficking
heroin at the time, that's why.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.213
Okay, but I thought you were
forced into the heroin thing.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.649
FELIX:
Did you really

13:00.692 --> 13:03.043
leave work early just
to come ridicule the way

13:03.086 --> 13:04.914
I handled the situation?I just don't want

13:04.958 --> 13:07.308
to see you go to prison
for the rest of your life.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.311
But, honestly,
self-defense was

13:10.354 --> 13:12.269
my one swing, and so,
unless you have an eyewitness

13:12.313 --> 13:14.054
or someone
to corroborate that story,

13:14.097 --> 13:16.186
I have to pivot
and think of something else.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.624
Wait. There is actually somebody
who could corroborate, but,

13:19.668 --> 13:21.670
uh,

13:21.713 --> 13:23.628
they're gonna take
some convincing.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.674
[door buzzes, latch clicks]

13:30.070 --> 13:32.072
[door closes]

13:33.073 --> 13:35.162
Who are you?

13:36.554 --> 13:39.035
Lesley Bell, your new attorney.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.433
Look, I don't have any money.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.914
I'm doing this pro bono.Why?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
I've reviewed your case, Sam.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.613
I can't promise
you won't do any time,

13:51.656 --> 13:53.833
but I know I can get a lot
of these charges thrown out.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.488
Like the murder of...
Vincent Davis?

13:57.532 --> 14:00.230
All they have is
your fingerprints in his car.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.015
On the passenger side.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.668
Have you ever ridden
in that seat,

14:03.712 --> 14:05.540
in the last-- I don't
know-- five years?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.933
Nope.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.673
Well, let's say you had.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.328
That would explain
the fingerprint.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.591
Okay.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.984
Here's my overall strategy
for the stuff

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
I can't get thrown out.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.467
You started in the business
when you were too young

14:19.510 --> 14:21.469
to think for yourself.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.472
Your main shot at survival
was doing what you were told,

14:24.515 --> 14:26.430
which mainly consisted
of threatening people

14:26.474 --> 14:28.693
into working for
Nia Bailey, right?

14:28.737 --> 14:30.739
So this isn't free.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.263
Like I said,
I'm doing this pro bono.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.048
Lesley Bell, right?

14:35.091 --> 14:38.007
You're related to Felix.
Let me guess.

14:38.051 --> 14:41.315
You want me to testify
that I coerced them into this?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.012
What happened?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.796
They get caught?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.669
Murphy... might,

14:47.712 --> 14:50.193
yes, and I'm
worried if she does,

14:50.237 --> 14:52.543
my brother's gonna go down, too.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.720
Sam, you need good
representation.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.418
Loyalty isn't gonna get you
anything anymore.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.639
You never
had a chance.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.468
Give yourself one.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.862
[sighs]

15:08.646 --> 15:11.693
I'll think about it, okay?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.913
I'll leave my number
with your CO.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.701
[door buzzes]

15:21.529 --> 15:24.880
Mom, can we... can we please
just get back in the car?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.534
This is so stupid.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.275
I need to go back to
Chicago. I-I got to...

15:28.318 --> 15:29.711
I got to go.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.931
Jess and Felix--
they're worried about me.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.584
You know what's funny?

15:33.628 --> 15:35.412
You still think
you can lie to me.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.848
No, I'm not lying.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.459
Please.No.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.330
You've been lying
since you could talk.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.072
Every time you said
you were doing your homework

15:43.116 --> 15:45.379
when you were actually
smoking pot in your room.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.859
Every time you said
you were staying at Jess's

15:47.903 --> 15:50.210
when you were actually sneaking
into Jared Johnson's bedroom?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.212
Okay.I know every lie you have

15:52.255 --> 15:54.214
ever told me, Murphy.You know what's
even funnier, Mom?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.912
You think
you know everything about me.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.132
Well, I clearly don't know
everything.No, you don't.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.569
That's okay! Just stop...

16:01.612 --> 16:04.006
Stop trying to control
my every move!

16:04.050 --> 16:06.182
Control your every move?

16:06.226 --> 16:08.271
Come on!
You come on!

16:08.315 --> 16:11.666
You try to keep me
in this little box.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.625
You picked my job,
and you picked my apartment,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.410
you homeschooled me...

16:16.453 --> 16:19.413
Oh, I am so sorry for wanting
to protect you, Murphy!

16:19.456 --> 16:20.980
Well, look around, Mom.
Look around.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.372
It did the opposite.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.244
Oh, here it comes.
All my fault.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.942
You know what? I will
find another ride.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.813
Oh, really? How?Believe it
or not, Mom,

16:28.857 --> 16:30.946
I am capable
of doing things without you.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
[scoffs]I am.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.517
[yelling]:
Help! Someone help me!

16:36.560 --> 16:38.171
Please!JOY:Murphy,

16:38.214 --> 16:39.737
what are you doing?I need help!

16:39.781 --> 16:42.566
Ma'am?Help!
Oh, God.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.177
Is everything okay?No, I-I'm...

16:44.220 --> 16:46.266
I'm blind, and I'm lost,

16:46.309 --> 16:48.050
and this woman is harassing me.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
I just need a ride out of here.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.922
Where are you headed?I am going

16:50.966 --> 16:52.272
to Chicago.No! No, you are not
getting into a car

16:52.315 --> 16:53.969
with a stranger.Ma'am, ma'am.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.405
Lower your voice.I am her mother.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.843
Lower your voice
and get away from me.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.149
Is this really your mom?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.151
No! No.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.892
I don't even know her.
I've never even met her

17:03.935 --> 17:05.720
in my life.Check her jacket pocket.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.331
You will find ChapStick
and potato chip crumbs.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.466
Okay, maybe she
is my mother,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.294
but that doesn't mean
she isn't harassing me.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.730
Please give me a ride.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.514
Be nicer to your mom.JOY:
Thank you.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.690
You are impossible.Don't, don't, don't.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.692
You are im...[sniffles]

17:21.736 --> 17:23.433
I don't have time
for this, Mom.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.480
If you're not gonna
drive me, just... just go.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
I'm not going anywhere.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.397
Fine. I'll go, and I'll
go find another ride,

17:30.440 --> 17:31.876
and you just stay
here forever.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.269
No. No. You don't move
a muscle, Murphy Mason.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.358
Mom, don't you get it?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.015
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.760
Forward, Pretzel.

17:45.803 --> 17:49.242
Just wait!
Just... wait.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.114
What?

17:52.158 --> 17:54.725
Just let me buy you lunch
before you go.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.339
I can tell
you've barely eaten in days.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.998
LESLEY:
I don't know what to tell you.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.783
Sam says she needs time,

18:08.826 --> 18:10.785
but I really think
she'll come around.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.395
We don't have time.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.267
That's not actually true.
We don't even know

18:14.310 --> 18:15.833
when Murphy's gonna
get arrested,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.531
and after she does, she
still has to wait for trial.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.141
And in said trial,

18:19.185 --> 18:21.274
we need Sam's help,
which you didn't get.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.102
I said I think
she'll come around.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.321
Just wait. I'm telling you.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.931
I'm going
back to work.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.936
Let me know the moment
you hear from her, please.Mm-hmm.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.509
It's 8,000 bucks
and an extra $50 for the phone.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
You'll pay Jason
at Lefty's Lodge,

18:41.207 --> 18:42.556
who'll give you
your passport.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.080
Got it. Thank you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.647
Hey, could you tell me

18:46.690 --> 18:48.344
about a girl that
got an ID from you,

18:48.388 --> 18:50.085
like, ten years ago?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.348
Jennifer Walker.

18:54.524 --> 18:57.745
I'll give you, like,
an extra 500 bucks.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
Walker, you said?

19:03.794 --> 19:05.796
Yeah.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
Oh. I never actually met her.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
Someone sold me her identity
a few months ago.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.806
A few months ago?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.765
Who?
Her brother.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.514
Do you think you could
give me Murphy's number?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.211
It was in my old phone.Come on, man.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.734
What? Don't you think
it's kind of weird

19:30.778 --> 19:32.345
Jenny's brother
sold her identity?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.825
What I think is weird
is you not getting out of town.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.567
Just... give
me her number.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.050
[scoffs]

19:42.093 --> 19:44.705
"You just slept with the girl,
like, once."

19:46.750 --> 19:49.231
