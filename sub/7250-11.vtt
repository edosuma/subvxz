WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.712
HI.

00:02.169 --> 00:03.712
GOOD EVENING.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.422
MAY I TAKE YOUR COATS?

00:03.754 --> 00:05.422
THANKS.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.758
Emily: THAT'S THE MOST ABSURD

00:05.464 --> 00:07.758
THING I'VE EVER HEARD!

00:07.800 --> 00:09.384
YOUR MOTHER'S

00:07.800 --> 00:09.384
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.720
LAST CHANCE TO RUN, HUH?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.720
EXCUSE ME?

00:11.762 --> 00:14.682
JUST IGNORE HER.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.475
Emily:

00:14.723 --> 00:16.475
OF COURSE I SAID IT!

00:16.517 --> 00:20.354
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO WOULD TAKE

00:16.517 --> 00:20.354
"JACKBOOTED" AS A COMPLIMENT.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.772
I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE!

00:21.814 --> 00:23.524
EVERY TIME SHE WENT

00:21.814 --> 00:23.524
TO THE PANTRY,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.860
I THOUGHT SHE WAS MARCHING

00:23.565 --> 00:25.860
ON POLAND.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.946
OH, I SEE, BECAUSE I WANT THINGS

00:25.901 --> 00:28.946
A CERTAIN WAY, I'M UNREASONABLE?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.489
Shh.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.867
THAT'S THE MOST ABSURD --

00:30.531 --> 00:32.867
I WANNA SEE THIS DOCUMENT.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.452
FAX IT TO ME IMMEDIATELY.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.452
"Fax it to me immediately"?

00:35.494 --> 00:36.912
She's part

00:35.494 --> 00:36.912
of the electronic age.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.957
TOMORROW MORNING

00:36.954 --> 00:39.957
IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

00:39.999 --> 00:43.002
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE

00:39.999 --> 00:43.002
I'M PAYING YOU $300 AN HOUR.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.837
SO TURN THAT LITTLE

00:43.042 --> 00:44.837
NEAR-LUXURY CAR AROUND,

00:44.879 --> 00:48.173
GO BACK TO YOUR OFFICE, AND FAX

00:44.879 --> 00:48.173
ME THAT LIBELOUS SCRAP OF PAPER.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.551
Also if he can pick up

00:48.215 --> 00:50.551
some ice cream.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.554
TELL YOUR WIFE TO TAPE

00:50.592 --> 00:53.554
YOUR DAUGHTER'S RECITAL.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.889
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.889
HI, MOM.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.016
HEY, GRANDMA.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.016
WHEN DID YOU TWO GET HERE?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.018
BETWEEN THE SECOND "ABSURD"

00:57.057 --> 00:59.018
AND THE THIRD "UNBELIEVABLE."

00:59.059 --> 01:02.187
I APOLOGIZE.

00:59.059 --> 01:02.187
THAT CALL CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.439
IS EVERYTHING ALRIGHT, GRANDMA?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.439
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.649
YOU SURE?

01:04.481 --> 01:05.649
I'M SURE.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.317
YOU LOOK PEEVED.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.317
I'M NOT PEEVED.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.736
WELL, YOU LOOK PEEVED.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.988
KINDLY STOP MAKING ME

01:08.777 --> 01:10.988
SAY THE WORD "PEEVED."

01:11.030 --> 01:13.448
MOM, SPILL IT.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.448
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.409
THAT WAS OUR LAWYER

01:13.490 --> 01:15.409
CALLING TO INFORM ME

01:15.450 --> 01:16.994
THAT ONE

01:15.450 --> 01:16.994
OF OUR FORMER MAIDS

01:17.036 --> 01:19.371
IS SUING

01:17.036 --> 01:19.371
FOR WRONGFUL TERMINATION.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.497
HMM.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.082
YOU MIGHT AT LEAST

01:20.539 --> 01:22.082
ACT SURPRISED.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.334
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.334
IT MOST CERTAINLY IS.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.545
REALLY?

01:24.376 --> 01:26.545
YES, LOREALAI, REALLY.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.838
WELL, THEN, I'M SURPRISED.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.631
IT'S BEYOND SURPRISING.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.631
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.091
WHAT DID GRANDPA SAY?

01:29.673 --> 01:32.091
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S

01:29.673 --> 01:32.091
STILL IN LONDON

01:32.133 --> 01:34.678
HELPING HIS MOTHER CLOSE

01:32.133 --> 01:34.678
DOWN HER HOUSE.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.472
I THINK HE PLANNED

01:34.720 --> 01:37.472
IT THAT WAY.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.472
WHICH MAID WAS IT?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.224
GERTA, THE ONE

01:37.514 --> 01:39.224
FROM HAMBURG, GERMANY.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.309
WHICH ONE WAS SHE?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.309
YOU REMEMBER.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.812
SHE WAS THE ONE YOU MADE THOSE

01:41.351 --> 01:43.812
HAMBURG/HAMBURGER JOKES TO.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.856
I BEAT

01:43.854 --> 01:45.856
THAT DEAD HORSE.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.856
WITH GLEE.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.399
SHE WAS THE CLOMPER.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.399
"THE CLOMPER?"

01:47.441 --> 01:48.817
SHE'D BE MAKING THE BEDS,

01:48.859 --> 01:50.652
IT WOULD SOUND LIKE

01:48.859 --> 01:50.652
A MUNICH-BEER-HALL RALLY.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.112
THAT'S WHY YOU FIRED HER?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.112
YES.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.823
BECAUSE SHE MADE NOISE

01:52.153 --> 01:54.823
WHEN SHE WALKED?

01:52.153 --> 01:54.823
YES.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.784
WAS SHE A GOOD MAID

01:54.865 --> 01:56.784
OTHERWISE?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.784
WHAT?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.869
BESIDES THE CLOMPING,

01:56.825 --> 01:58.869
WAS SHE POLITE, ON TIME,

01:58.911 --> 02:01.204
MADE SURE THE LITTLE FORK

01:58.911 --> 02:01.204
WENT ON THE OUTSIDE?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.664
HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO ME?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.750
SHE WASN'T PERFORMING

02:02.706 --> 02:04.750
HER DUTIES AS I WISHED

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
THEM TO BE PERFORMED.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
THE REST DOESN'T MATTER.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.296
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.296
WHAT'S THAT

02:06.835 --> 02:09.296
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
YOU FIND THE ONE THING

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
ABOUT A MAID

02:11.381 --> 02:13.092
THAT NEGATES

02:11.381 --> 02:13.092
ALL OF HER GOOD QUALITIES.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.844
ISN'T IT EASIER TO LET

02:13.133 --> 02:15.844
A COUPLE OF THINGS SLIDE?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.137
SO IT'S MY FAULT.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.139
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.139
NO, LORELAI, YOU DID.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.725
FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN LISTENING

02:19.180 --> 02:21.725
TO YOU AND YOUR FATHER

02:21.767 --> 02:24.352
AND EVERYONE ELSE GO ON

02:21.767 --> 02:24.352
ABOUT HOW DEMANDING I AM.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.688
HOW I HAVE TO HAVE

02:24.394 --> 02:26.688
THINGS A CERTAIN WAY.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.984
I PAY TO HAVE THEM THAT WAY.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.984
I PAY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE.

02:30.025 --> 02:33.528
WHEN IT'S NOT HOW I WANT,

02:30.025 --> 02:33.528
IT MEANS I'M NOT GETTING

02:30.025 --> 02:33.528
WHAT I PAID FOR.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.989
WHY IS THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.698
IT ISN'T HARD TO UNDERSTAND,

02:35.030 --> 02:36.698
IT'S --

02:36.740 --> 02:39.743
IF YOU PAY FOR FIRST CLASS

02:36.740 --> 02:39.743
AND YOU END UP IN COACH,

02:39.785 --> 02:43.204
PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO BE UPSET.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.204
NO ONE CALLS YOU DEMANDING

02:39.785 --> 02:43.204
OR UNREASONABLE.

02:43.246 --> 02:47.542
AND YET THIS WOMAN

02:43.246 --> 02:47.542
WHOM I PAY MORE THAN SHE COULD

02:43.246 --> 02:47.542
GET ANYWHERE ELSE IN HARTFORD,

02:47.584 --> 02:50.963
WHOSE SEVERANCE PACKAGE COULD

02:47.584 --> 02:50.963
FINANCE A SUMMER CRUISE

02:47.584 --> 02:50.963
DOWN THE RHINE

02:51.005 --> 02:53.590
DRAGGING ME INTO COURT

02:51.005 --> 02:53.590
SAYING THAT I WAS UNFAIR.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.383
WHY? BECAUSE HAVING PAID

02:53.632 --> 02:55.383
FOR ONE THING,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.053
I'M NOT CONTENT WITH SOMETHING

02:55.425 --> 02:58.053
ELSE? THAT MAKES ME UNFAIR?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.721
WELL, THEN, SO BE IT.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.724
LET SOMEONE ELSE PAY FIRST CLASS

02:59.763 --> 03:02.724
AND RIDE IN STEERAGE, NOT ME.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.518
EXCUSE ME, MRS. GILMORE.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.518
DINNER'S READY.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.270
THANK YOU, BROOKE.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.270
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.481
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.482
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

03:10.524 --> 03:13.318

03:10.524 --> 03:13.318

04:17.424 --> 04:19.593
I NEED YOU TO --

04:17.424 --> 04:19.593
SHH! SHH!

04:19.634 --> 04:21.678
IT'S STARTED! YOU WERE SUPPOSED

04:19.634 --> 04:21.678
TO CALL ME.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.804
STOP TALKING.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.389
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.474
YOU WANNA BE A DICTATOR!

04:24.431 --> 04:26.474
COME OFF IT!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.894
COMMANDANT ST. JAMES SAYS,

04:26.516 --> 04:28.894
"BRUSSELS SPROUTS!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.645
YOU WILL BRING ME

04:28.936 --> 04:30.645
THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS!"

04:30.687 --> 04:33.023
I'M TRYING TO PLAN A MENU HERE,

04:30.687 --> 04:33.023
JACKSON!

04:33.065 --> 04:34.649
FILL ME IN, PLEASE.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.069
JACKSON BROUGHT PEA TENDRILS

04:34.691 --> 04:37.069
INSTEAD OF BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.320
AREN'T WE EVEL KNIEVEL?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.320
COFFEE?

04:39.362 --> 04:42.282
PEA TENDRILS ARE TOO DELICATE

04:39.362 --> 04:42.282
TO SERVE WITH THE LAMB SHANK!

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.410
WHERE ARE

04:43.742 --> 04:45.410
THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.704
I LOOKED AT THE STOCKS.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.704
THEY WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH!

04:47.746 --> 04:48.914
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.916
DOESN'T IT MATTER

04:48.956 --> 04:50.916
THAT I CARE SO MUCH

04:50.958 --> 04:52.459
ABOUT THE QUALITY

04:50.958 --> 04:52.459
OF THE PRODUCE

04:52.500 --> 04:54.795
THAT I'D BE WILLING TO RISK

04:52.500 --> 04:54.795
AN ENORMOUS ARGUMENT

04:54.836 --> 04:57.338
JUST TO SAVE YOUR DINNER?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.338
OOPS. THAT WAS DUMB.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.466
SAVE MY DINNER?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.466
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.219
YES, MY DINNER IS OUT STANDING

04:59.507 --> 05:02.219
ON A LEDGE.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.054
"OH, NO!

05:02.261 --> 05:04.054
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?"

SOOKIE...

05:04.096 --> 05:06.056

05:06.098 --> 05:07.557
"IT'S A BIRD.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.557
IT'S A PLANE.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.602
IT'S SUPERJACKSON

05:07.599 --> 05:10.602
AND HIS ATOMIC PEA TENDRILS!"

05:10.644 --> 05:12.353
YOU WANNA GET

05:10.644 --> 05:12.353
ANOTHER PRODUCE GUY?

05:12.395 --> 05:13.939
MAYBE I SHOULD.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.939
WELL, GO AHEAD.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.108
DON'T TEMPT ME!

05:13.981 --> 05:16.108
THAT'S IT!

05:13.981 --> 05:16.108
I AM LEAVING!

05:16.150 --> 05:18.193
GO! BUT TAKE THE TENDRILS

05:16.150 --> 05:18.193
WITH YA!

05:18.235 --> 05:20.361
FINE!

05:20.403 --> 05:22.614
SEE YOU TONIGHT?

05:20.403 --> 05:22.614
I LOVE YOU.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.243
AND IT ALWAYS ENDS WITH A HUG.

05:22.656 --> 05:26.243
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

05:26.285 --> 05:28.162
THE NEW INSURANCE POLICIES

05:26.285 --> 05:28.162
YOU ORDERED.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.413
GOOD. AND THE INSPECTOR'S

05:28.203 --> 05:30.413
SUPPOSED TO BE COMING BY

05:35.335 --> 05:37.838
TWO OF YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.799
COURSE AT THE LEARNING CENTER.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.176

05:49.183 --> 05:50.976
THERE -- YOU OWE ME $75.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.812
WHY ARE YOU BEING A SNOB?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.812
YOU WENT TO HOTEL SCHOOL.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.647
I ATTENDED

05:53.854 --> 05:55.647
THE ECOLE HOTELIERE DE GENEVE.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.482
THAT'LL MAKE ONE HELL

05:55.689 --> 05:57.482
OF A SWEATSHIRT.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.277
IT WAS ONE OF THE PREMIERE

05:57.524 --> 06:00.277
HOTEL SCHOOLS IN THE WORLD.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.322
YOU TWO ARE GOING TO TAKE

06:00.319 --> 06:03.322
A TWO-HOUR COURSE AT A RADISSON.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.866
JACKSON'S TAKEN A LOT OF COURSES

06:03.362 --> 06:05.866
THROUGH THE LEARNING CENTER,

06:05.907 --> 06:08.035
AND HE LOVES IT.

06:05.907 --> 06:08.035
HE TOOK BEEKEEPING --

06:08.076 --> 06:10.704
JACKSON KEEPS BEES?

06:08.076 --> 06:10.704
NO, IT TURNED OUT

06:08.076 --> 06:10.704
HE WAS ALLERGIC.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.747
ONE STUNG HIS LIP,

06:10.745 --> 06:12.747
AND HIS WHOLE HEAD

06:12.789 --> 06:14.833
BLEW UP TO THREE TIMES

06:12.789 --> 06:14.833
ITS NORMAL SIZE.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.501
PLEASE TELL ME

06:14.875 --> 06:16.501
YOU HAVE PICTURES.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.338

06:16.543 --> 06:19.338
FORECLOSED REAL ESTATE,

06:19.378 --> 06:22.465
AND HOW TO WRITE A DIARY.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.465
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

06:22.507 --> 06:24.092
HE'S A SEARCHER.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.092
YES, HE IS.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.094
I THINK HE WAS LONELY

06:24.134 --> 06:26.094
BEFORE WE MET

06:26.136 --> 06:28.347
AND HE DIDN'T LIVE

06:26.136 --> 06:28.347
NEAR A BAR.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.347
YES.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.640
TOMORROW WILL BE

06:28.387 --> 06:30.640
A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.185
I'LL BE HERE TO LAUGH

06:30.682 --> 06:33.185
AT YOU WHEN YOU RETURN.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.602
THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.813
FORGET HIM. OPENING

06:34.644 --> 06:36.813
AN INN IS A HUGE STEP,

06:36.855 --> 06:39.733
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP

06:36.855 --> 06:39.733
IS WORTH TRYING.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.733
EXACTLY, PARTNER.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.569
TELL ME YOU GOT PICTURES

06:39.774 --> 06:42.569
OF JACKSON AND HIS GIANT HEAD.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.696
I'LL BRING THEM IN TOMORROW.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.995
HEY, PARIS.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.995
HAVE YOU LOOKED OVER THE

06:49.034 --> 06:51.995
VOTES FOR COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER?

06:52.037 --> 06:55.290
YEAH.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.290
ARE THE ONES FOR PRINCESS

06:52.037 --> 06:55.290
DIANA'S BUTLER JOKES OR REAL?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.376
JOKES.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.376
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES

06:55.332 --> 06:57.376
FOR DR. PHIL?

06:57.416 --> 07:00.545
I THINK REAL.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.545
I KNEW THAT SUGGESTION BOX

06:57.416 --> 07:00.545
WAS A BAD IDEA.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.838
WATCH CHOATE GET JOAN DIDION

07:01.880 --> 07:03.840
WHILE WE'RE BEING READ

07:01.880 --> 07:03.840
"ELOISE AT THE PLAZA."

07:03.882 --> 07:06.343
BEFORE THE OTHERS GET HERE,

07:03.882 --> 07:06.343
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DECIDE

07:06.385 --> 07:07.886
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.886
ABOUT WHAT?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.888
THE PROM COUP FRANCIE

07:07.928 --> 07:09.888
STAGED LAST WEEK.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.472
YOU MEAN BOOKING

07:09.930 --> 07:11.472
WADSWORTH MANSION?

07:11.514 --> 07:14.059
USING THE MONEY FOR THE

07:11.514 --> 07:14.059
TELESCOPE FOR THE SENIOR GIFT.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.811
WHY DOES ONE PINHEAD ALWAYS

07:14.101 --> 07:16.811
HAVE TO VOTE FOR JERRY GARCIA?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.646
I'M NOT SURE IF THE

07:16.853 --> 07:18.646
DEPOSIT CHECK --

07:18.688 --> 07:20.607
I TOOK CARE OF THAT.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.607
WHAT?

07:20.648 --> 07:23.484
WADSWORTH MANSION IS OWNED

07:20.648 --> 07:23.484
BY THE CONNECTICUT DAUGHTERS

07:20.648 --> 07:23.484
OF THE MAYFLOWER.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.114
MOST OF THOSE BIDDIES COULDN'T

07:23.526 --> 07:27.114
NEGOTIATE AN ICY SIDEWALK

07:23.526 --> 07:27.114
MUCH LESS A CONTRACT.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.117
TOOK ME FIVE MINUTES TO GET THEM

07:27.155 --> 07:30.117
TO HALF THEIR ASKING PRICE.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.536
YOU'RE KIDDING.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.536
I WASN'T GONNA LET THE

07:30.158 --> 07:33.536
CLASS GIFT BE A STUPID TREE

07:33.578 --> 07:36.039
JUST SO GINGER SPICE CAN HAVE

07:33.578 --> 07:36.039
HER BARBIE DREAM PROM.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.542
SHE'S A SNEAK.

07:36.081 --> 07:39.542
SHE'S NOT SMART ENOUGH

07:36.081 --> 07:39.542
TO BE A SNEAK.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.545
IT'S THAT LOSER MR. HUNTER

07:39.584 --> 07:42.545
THAT LET HER GET AWAY WITH IT.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.341
SHE FORCED HIM INTO IT.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.341
YOU CAN'T FORCE A TEACHER

07:42.587 --> 07:46.341
INTO SOMETHING, RORY.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.009
NO, IT WAS HUNTER.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.137
HE'S BEEN JEALOUS

07:48.051 --> 07:50.137
SINCE I GOT INTO OFFICE.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.680
WHENEVER I ANNOUNCE I HAVE

07:50.178 --> 07:52.680
A NEW MOTION TO INTRODUCE,

07:52.722 --> 07:55.350
HE FLINCHES, ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

07:52.722 --> 07:55.350
TIGHTENS UP FOR A MOMENT.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.893
IT'S CREEPY.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.893
YEAH. BUT --

07:56.935 --> 07:58.603
OUR FEARLESS LEADERS

07:56.935 --> 07:58.603
AT WORK ALREADY.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.439
I FEEL SO SAFE.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.690
THAT GIRL BUGS ME.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.690
RELAX. SHE'S HARMLESS.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.984
PARIS, RORY.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.736
"PARIS, RORY." BED WETTER.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.736
SHALL WE SIT?

08:06.778 --> 08:07.946
FINE, LET'S SIT.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.243
I CALL THIS MEETING OF THE

08:10.615 --> 08:13.243
STUDENT COUNCIL TO ORDER.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.247
IS THE SECRETARY READY?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.247
I AM.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.457
THEN LET'S PROCEED.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.292
FIRST OF ALL,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.292
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE

08:20.334 --> 08:22.543
FOR MISSING LAST WEEK'S

08:20.334 --> 08:22.543
SOMEWHAT IMPROMPTU MEETING.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.463
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,

08:22.585 --> 08:24.463
ITS SCHEDULING

08:24.504 --> 08:25.797
WAS SOMEWHAT UNORTHODOX

08:25.839 --> 08:28.049
SINCE THE MEETING WAS

08:25.839 --> 08:28.049
A SUPPLEMENTARY MEETING,

08:28.091 --> 08:30.010
WHICH WAS A CONCEPT

08:28.091 --> 08:30.010
INVENTED BY ME.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.346
SO THE FACT THAT ANYONE

08:30.051 --> 08:32.346
WOULD HOLD A MEETING

08:32.387 --> 08:35.307
INVENTED BY A CERTAIN PERSON

08:32.387 --> 08:35.307
WITHOUT THAT CERTAIN PERSON

08:35.349 --> 08:38.226
SEEMS, WELL, LET'S SEE --

08:35.349 --> 08:38.226
WHAT'S THE WORD? --

08:38.268 --> 08:40.728
MUTINOUS, INSULTING,

08:38.268 --> 08:40.728
UNDERHANDED,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.563
AND, IN THE END, FRUITLESS,

08:42.605 --> 08:44.607
SINCE I MANAGED TO RENEGOTIATE

08:42.605 --> 08:44.607
THE RENTAL FEE

08:44.649 --> 08:45.859
FOR THE WADSWORTH MANSION

08:45.900 --> 08:48.236
SO THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

08:45.900 --> 08:48.236
TO HAVE THE PROM

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
AND GIVE THE SCHOOL

08:48.278 --> 08:50.571
A RESPECTABLE SENIOR GIFT

08:50.613 --> 08:52.615
IN THE FORM OF A TELESCOPE.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.869
ANY QUESTIONS, MR. CHRISTIAN --

08:52.657 --> 08:55.869
I MEAN, MR. HUNTER.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.204
UH, NO.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.706
GOOD. SO, NOW THAT THAT'S

08:57.245 --> 08:59.706
OUT OF THE WAY,

08:59.747 --> 09:02.000
LET'S MOVE ON

08:59.747 --> 09:02.000
TO OTHER BUSINESS. FRANCIE.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.085
AS YOU KNOW,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.085
HEALTH WEEK IS COMING UP.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.046
WE HAVE SPEAKERS LINED UP

09:04.127 --> 09:06.046
TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING

09:06.087 --> 09:07.672
FROM HEART DISEASE

09:06.087 --> 09:07.672
AND EXERCISE

09:07.714 --> 09:09.883
TO THE DANGERS

09:07.714 --> 09:09.883
OF SUN DAMAGE AND FRIED FOOD.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.592
EVERYONE'S BOOKED

09:09.924 --> 09:11.592
AND READY TO GO.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.846
WE'LL NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

09:11.634 --> 09:14.846
TO SET UP THE SIGN-UP TABLE

09:14.888 --> 09:16.556
FOR THE ANNUAL BLOOD DRIVE.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.556
AAAAAAH!

09:16.597 --> 09:18.308
JEEZ.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.308
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:18.350 --> 09:21.102
SHE HATES THE WORD "blood."

09:18.350 --> 09:21.102
GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.064
KEEP YOUR HANDS

09:21.144 --> 09:24.064
ON YOUR EARS.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.064
TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.607
AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE

09:24.105 --> 09:26.607
FREAK-OUT, WE'VE TO DECIDE

09:26.649 --> 09:29.110
WHERE TO PLACE THE SIGN-UP

09:26.649 --> 09:29.110
TABLE FOR THE BLOOD DRIVE.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.112
I CAN STILL HEAR HER!

09:29.152 --> 09:31.112
HUM TO YOURSELF.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.781
CONTINUE, PLEASE.

09:31.154 --> 09:33.781
I'M PROPOSING PUTTING IT

09:31.154 --> 09:33.781
IN THE CAFETERIA.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.368
[ HUMMING ]

09:33.823 --> 09:36.368
IT'S GOT EASY ACCESS,

09:33.823 --> 09:36.368
MAXIMUM EXPOSURE,

09:36.410 --> 09:40.414
ALMOST 90% OF THE STUDENT BODY

09:36.410 --> 09:40.414
VISITS THE CAFETERIA EVERY DAY.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.414
IT'S THE PERFECT LOCATION.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.789
WELL?

09:40.455 --> 09:41.789
NO.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.584
EXCUSE ME?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.584
YOU CAN'T. IT'S A FIRE HAZARD.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.379
IT IS?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.379
YES. YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND

09:44.625 --> 09:47.379
ANOTHER PLACE.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.589
YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.589
I NEVER KID

09:47.421 --> 09:49.589
ABOUT FIRE SAFETY.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.175
RORY, I ACTUALLY KNOW THE

09:49.630 --> 09:52.175
FIRE CODES FOR THE CAFETERIA,

09:52.217 --> 09:54.969
AND AS LONG AS WE DON'T

09:52.217 --> 09:54.969
HAVE MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE,

09:55.011 --> 09:57.889
WE CAN START AN OPIUM DEN, THE

09:55.011 --> 09:57.889
FIRE DEPARTMENT WOULDN'T CARE.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.558
A: I THINK THEY WOULD CARE.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.351
AND B: I'M NOT TALKING

09:59.599 --> 10:01.351
ABOUT NUMBERS.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.853
YOU SET UP THAT TABLE, GET

10:01.393 --> 10:03.853
PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT BLOOD,

10:03.895 --> 10:06.981
SOMEONE SMELLS SMOKE,

10:03.895 --> 10:06.981
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

10:03.895 --> 10:06.981
50 STAMPEDING TEENAGERS

10:07.023 --> 10:10.235
ARE USING YOUR BODY TO LEVER

10:07.023 --> 10:10.235
OPEN A DOOR. I WON'T ALLOW THAT.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.736
THIS IS "XANADU"-LEVEL

10:10.277 --> 10:11.736
OF INSANE.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.780
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE

10:11.778 --> 10:13.780
OPPOSING THE BLOOD DRIVE?

10:13.821 --> 10:15.990
NO, I'M OPPOSING THE BLOOD DRIVE

10:13.821 --> 10:15.990
IN THE CAFETERIA.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.286
IS IT THAT BIG A DEAL?

10:16.032 --> 10:19.286
IT'S THE RULES

10:16.032 --> 10:19.286
OF COMMON DECENCY.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.538
AND I WON'T LET

10:19.327 --> 10:21.538
FRANCIE IGNORE THOSE RULES.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.624
WELL, OKAY. MOTION DENIED.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.419
THE SENIOR CLASS PRESIDENT WILL

10:24.665 --> 10:27.419
COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATE PLAN

10:27.461 --> 10:30.171
FOR THE LOCATION OF THE SIGN-UP

10:27.461 --> 10:30.171
TABLE FOR THE BLOOD DRIVE.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.466
LOUISE, POKE JOHN WILLIAMS

10:30.213 --> 10:32.466
OVER THERE AND TELL HER

10:32.507 --> 10:34.675
SHE CAN CUT THE SCORE,

10:32.507 --> 10:34.675
WE'RE MOVING ON.

10:34.717 --> 10:38.555
ADVERTISING SPACE IN THE

10:34.717 --> 10:38.555
YEARBOOK IS ONLY 50% SOLD.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.599

HER LAWYER KNOWS WE ASKED

11:57.509 --> 11:59.718
FOR THIS DEPOSITION.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.056
HOW'S IT GOING TO LOOK WHEN

YOU REFUSE TO TESTIFY

11:59.760 --> 12:03.056
FOR YOUR MOTHER?

12:03.097 --> 12:06.142

THERE IS SOMETHING

12:25.245 --> 12:27.247
CALLED FAMILY LOYALTY.

IT MEANS WHEN SOMEONE IS

12:27.288 --> 12:29.748

AS I HAVE HELPED YOU SEVERAL

12:29.790 --> 12:32.293
TIMES OVER THE YEARS.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.672
THE VERY LEAST YOU COULD DO

12:32.335 --> 12:35.672
IN RETURN IS SPEND HALF AN HOUR

12:35.714 --> 12:37.798
SAYING SOMETHING KIND

12:35.714 --> 12:37.798
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.222

12:47.308 --> 12:48.268
WANT SOME OF MINE?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.812
LET'S GO.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.528
I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH

12:56.109 --> 12:58.528
THE VALUE OF A GOOD PAINT JOB.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.863
ONE OF THE FIRST DECISIONS

12:58.570 --> 13:00.863
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE

13:00.905 --> 13:02.365
WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR INN

13:02.407 --> 13:05.452
IS WHETHER TO EMPLOY YOUR

13:02.407 --> 13:05.452
HOUSEKEEPERS INDIVIDUALLY

13:05.493 --> 13:09.038
OR CONTRACT OUT TO

13:05.493 --> 13:09.038
A HOUSEKEEPING SERVICE.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.001
IF YOU USE A SERVICE,

13:09.080 --> 13:14.001
YOU'LL BE ASSURED OF HAVING

13:09.080 --> 13:14.001
A REPLACEMENT HOUSEKEEPER

13:14.043 --> 13:17.004
IF ONE SHOULD CALL IN SICK

13:14.043 --> 13:17.004
OR QUIT SUDDENLY.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.881
BUT YOU'LL PAY $2 MORE

13:17.046 --> 13:18.881
AN HOUR,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.676
AND THEY'LL BE LOYAL

13:18.923 --> 13:21.676
TO THE SERVICE, NOT TO YOU.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.763
HOWEVER, YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP

13:21.718 --> 13:24.763
PAYING A BIT MORE

13:24.803 --> 13:27.140
THAN IF YOU HIRED THEM

13:24.803 --> 13:27.140
INDIVIDUALLY.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.100
I CAN'T BELIEVE

WE'D ALL WORK 14 HOURS STRAIGHT,

16:15.683 --> 16:18.728

16:29.029 --> 16:32.450
HE HAD BEEN UP THERE

16:29.029 --> 16:32.450
FOR A COUPLE YEARS ALREADY.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.829
BUT WE BOTH WERE IN PREP.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.829
AND, I REPEAT, BUNG?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.539

16:35.870 --> 16:38.539

16:38.581 --> 16:40.249

16:40.291 --> 16:43.336

16:50.593 --> 16:53.220
OOH, NOT BAD, NOT BAD.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.723

17:06.567 --> 17:09.069

17:09.111 --> 17:11.489

17:09.111 --> 17:11.489
THE FOOD INDUSTRY. I'M COMING

17:09.111 --> 17:11.489
FROM IRONWORKS,

17:11.531 --> 17:14.951
SO I BASICALLY KNOW WHAT

17:11.531 --> 17:14.951
THE SECURITY GATE

17:11.531 --> 17:14.951
SHOULD BE MADE OF.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.328
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. ALEX

17:14.993 --> 17:17.328
IS AN INCREDIBLE BUSINESSMAN.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.039
THAT'S TRUE.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.039

17:20.080 --> 17:22.291

17:22.333 --> 17:25.503
THE ONLY THING LEFT

17:22.333 --> 17:25.503
BESIDES BUILDING THE PLACE

17:22.333 --> 17:25.503
IS PICKING A NAME.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.672
OH, LITTLE TIP --

17:25.545 --> 17:27.672
DON'T CHOOSE ANYTHING CUTE.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.757
LIKE JITTERS.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.757
OR SPILL THE BEANS.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.509
OR HIGHER GROUND.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.509
OR THE MUDHOUSE.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.094
ACTUALLY, I KINDA

17:31.551 --> 17:34.094
LIKE THAT.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.094
ME TOO. WE CALL DIBS.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.473
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

17:34.136 --> 17:37.473
OPENING AN INN.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.473
WE WANNA KEEP OUR OPTIONS OPEN.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.017
DID YOU HEAR

17:37.515 --> 17:39.017

17:39.058 --> 17:40.727
THE FELDSTER OPENED

17:39.058 --> 17:40.727

17:40.768 --> 17:42.812
I KNOW I'M REPEATING MYSELF,

17:40.768 --> 17:42.812
BUT THE FELDSTER?

17:42.854 --> 17:44.814
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE OPENED

17:42.854 --> 17:44.814
HIS OWN PLACE.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.066
HE SPENT THE WHOLE SUMMER

17:44.856 --> 17:47.066

17:47.107 --> 17:48.860
HE WAS OUR BAKER.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.860

17:50.820 --> 17:53.239
OH, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU STILL

17:50.820 --> 17:53.239
CAN'T HAVE THE MUDHOUSE.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.324
DO YOU REMEMBER THE LAST

17:53.280 --> 17:55.324
RECEPTION WE CATERED --

17:55.366 --> 17:57.702
THE PARAKEETS, EVERYONE DRESSED

17:55.366 --> 17:57.702
AS KNIGHTS AND LADIES?

OH, GOD.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.329

18:00.371 --> 18:02.206
YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING

18:00.371 --> 18:02.206
LIKE 'EM.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.710
I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT HOW BUNG

18:02.248 --> 18:05.710
GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH THE BRIDE.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.169
ONE MINUTE,

18:05.752 --> 18:07.169
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.171
NEXT, HE'S BEANING HER

18:07.211 --> 18:09.171
WITH THE ICE SCULPTURE.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.592
REMEMBER THE TIME YOU

18:09.213 --> 18:12.592
AND FAT SAL GOT LOCKED IN

18:16.303 --> 18:19.390
WITH THE BRIDE'S MOTHER.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.893
THAT'S RIGHT! HE WENT AFTER

18:19.432 --> 18:21.893

18:21.935 --> 18:24.520

18:28.190 --> 18:29.734

18:38.200 --> 18:39.702
I'M NOT SURE I REMEMBER THAT.

YOU KNOW,

18:39.744 --> 18:41.829
I ACTUALLY DON'T REMEMBER

18:41.871 --> 18:43.372
WHAT FELDMAN TOLD THE COPS.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.708
HE TRIED TO PRETEND HE DIDN'T

18:43.414 --> 18:45.708

18:57.053 --> 18:59.513

WHY WERE YOU DEPOSED?

22:52.079 --> 22:54.332

I WAS FINISHED

23:41.170 --> 23:42.922
WITH THE DINNER PREP,

23:42.963 --> 23:45.465

23:42.963 --> 23:45.465
ABOUT TWO OF THE APPETIZERS.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.676
MY FRIEND ACCIDENTALLY ASKED

39:02.174 --> 39:04.676
YOUR FRIEND ON A DATE.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.844
UM, RIGHT. HI.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.096
HOW ARE YOU?

39:05.885 --> 39:08.096
FAT SAL SENDS HIS LOVE.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.514
RIGHT BACK AT HIM.

39:09.555 --> 39:12.475
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING

39:09.555 --> 39:12.475
HOW I GOT YOUR NUMBER.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.768
INFORMATION?

39:13.810 --> 39:15.520
That would've been

39:13.810 --> 39:15.520
far too logical.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.896
I ACTUALLY CALLED YOUR INN.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.107
THIS FRENCH GUY GAVE ME

39:16.938 --> 39:19.107
YOUR HOME NUMBER.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.900
SAID I SHOULDN'T WORRY

39:19.149 --> 39:20.900
ABOUT CALLING LATE,

39:20.942 --> 39:23.153
YOU USUALLY STAY UP

39:20.942 --> 39:23.153
TILL 3:00, 4:00.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.280
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.280
HE'S GETTING FIRED TOMORROW.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.364
SO, WHAT'S UP?

39:26.405 --> 39:27.699
Well, I was wondering

39:26.405 --> 39:27.699
something.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.617
UH-HUH.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.286
I LIKE COFFEE SHOPS,

39:31.328 --> 39:33.163
TRY THEIR COFFEE,

39:31.328 --> 39:33.163
SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

39:33.205 --> 39:36.291
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN

39:33.205 --> 39:36.291
STEAL AND DISGUISE AS YOUR OWN?

39:36.333 --> 39:38.084
EXACTLY -- KIND OF A LOW-RENT

39:36.333 --> 39:38.084
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.878
ANYWAY, SOMETIMES

39:38.126 --> 39:39.878
I'LL HIT TWO COFFEE SHOPS

39:39.919 --> 39:41.838
THAT HAVE SURPRISINGLY

39:39.919 --> 39:41.838
SIMILAR PRODUCT,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.090
AND I CANNOT DECIDE

39:41.880 --> 39:44.090
WHICH ONE IS BETTER.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.842
BUMMER.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.842
Yes. Bummer.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.427
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE

39:45.884 --> 39:48.427
ANOTHER PERSON THERE

39:48.469 --> 39:50.180
WHO'D HELP ME MAKE

39:48.469 --> 39:50.180
THESE CRUCIAL EVALUATIONS.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.682
INTERESTING SOLUTION

39:50.222 --> 39:52.682
TO A FASCINATING PROBLEM.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.185
SO I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU WERE

39:52.724 --> 39:55.185

39:59.939 --> 40:03.068
IT'S BASICALLY JUST ME AND THIS

39:59.939 --> 40:03.068
GUY NAMED CHUCKLES IN BRAZIL.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.611
SOUNDS LIKE FATE.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.611
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

40:05.653 --> 40:07.280
SURE.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.280
Great.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.325
TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE --

40:07.322 --> 40:10.325
YOU KNOW THIS IS A DATE?

40:10.367 --> 40:12.160
OH, YEAH. I GOT THAT.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.160
GOOD.

40:12.202 --> 40:14.913
YOU GUYS COME UP WITH A NAME

40:12.202 --> 40:14.913
FOR YOUR PLACE YET?

40:14.954 --> 40:16.664
Right now the top contender

40:14.954 --> 40:16.664
is Sludge.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.416
EXCUSE ME?

40:16.706 --> 40:18.416
Moving on.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.086
My partner likes

40:18.457 --> 40:21.086
Regular Joe.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.712
Then again,

40:21.127 --> 40:22.712

40:22.754 --> 40:24.297
OH. FANCY THAT.
