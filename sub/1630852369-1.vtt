00:26.504 --> 00:27.766
- Hello?

00:27.810 --> 00:30.247
Guys? I'm back.

00:32.510 --> 00:35.035
Guys, dinner!

00:35.078 --> 00:37.472
Hi.
Why are you in dog prison?

00:37.515 --> 00:41.215
Dinner! Come down!
Grab your siblings.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.520
- Come here.
- Hi, baby.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.653
- Nick said dinner's ready.
- All right.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.263
- Georgie baby.
- No.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.525
- Give me the dog!
- No. No.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.570
- Hi.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.355
- You need a drink?
- Thank you.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.096
Love you.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
<i>Baby.</i>

00:54.532 --> 00:55.620
<i>Baby Georgie!</i>

00:55.664 --> 00:57.318
- Dad, Dad, Dad.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.623
Leave him alone.
- Oh.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.277
- We don't want him
to run out again.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.626
- Oh, my gosh.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.281
What has been going on
in the last five years?

01:04.325 --> 01:06.631
<i>We finished building
this dream house.</i>

01:06.675 --> 01:09.112
<i>It's 22,000 square feet.</i>

01:09.156 --> 01:11.419
And I think there's--

01:11.462 --> 01:12.681
I have no idea how many--

01:12.724 --> 01:14.291
how many rooms there are
in the house.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.640
I would have to, like...

01:15.684 --> 01:16.859
Four, five,

01:16.902 --> 01:19.166
six, seven, eight,

01:19.209 --> 01:22.430
9, 10, 11, 12.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.040
Okay, there's 13--

01:24.084 --> 01:25.781
well,
do you count ours as two?

01:25.824 --> 01:28.175
I don't think there's
an exorbitant amount of rooms.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.698
I think we have
the normal amount of rooms.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.786
They're just bigger.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.614
Except the movie theater.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.398
That's not a normal room
you have.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.618
I have so many bug bites
from Idaho.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.273
- I weirdly didn't get bit.
- What did you think of Idaho?

01:39.316 --> 01:42.189
Because dad and I were saying,
if you like it,

01:42.232 --> 01:43.581
we will build,
we'll do the whole thing.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.235
If not, maybe we should,
like, look around

01:45.279 --> 01:46.628
and see
where else we should build.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.369
- You know what conversation
this reminds me of?

01:48.412 --> 01:49.500
- What?
- The one where you were

01:49.544 --> 01:50.849
asking us about--
- Moving?

01:50.893 --> 01:51.850
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.897
It's time
to build a new house.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.464
- Another house.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.249
- And Coco,
what about you?

01:59.293 --> 02:00.424
- I would spend
the summer there.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.773
- You'd spent
the whole summer there?

02:01.817 --> 02:02.992
- Mm-hmm.
- And you don't think

02:03.035 --> 02:04.515
you'd get bored?
You'd have plenty to do?

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
- I'd probably get bored,
like, once.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.214
- Well, everyone
gets bored once.

02:07.257 --> 02:08.345
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's fair.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.825
Thank you, Nick!
- Yay.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.177
- So, you guys have
any hot plans

02:14.221 --> 02:15.874
for the rest of the summer,
till school starts?

02:17.746 --> 02:19.661
- I have...tennis.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.750
That's it.
I just have tennis.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.534
<i>- With daughters,
people will tell you</i>

02:23.578 --> 02:25.232
that they hate you
when they're 16.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.363
I would say,
that's bullsh--.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.235
They hate you
when they're 12 to 14,

02:28.278 --> 02:29.453
and then they come back.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.934
<i>Katarina is almost 15,</i>

02:31.977 --> 02:34.589
and we used to call her
"The Good One."

02:34.632 --> 02:37.244
- You just literally ripped off
all the pineapple.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.289
- So mean.
- Now we call her

02:39.333 --> 02:41.422
"The Artist Formerly Known
as the Good One."

02:41.465 --> 02:43.554
Coco, what do you want to do
the rest of the summer?

02:43.598 --> 02:45.252
- I don't know.
- Go on your phone.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.253
- Roblox?
- Really?

02:46.296 --> 02:47.645
- Yeah.
- Joking.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.430
- Not funny.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.607
- Coco is ten,
but you would think she's 21.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.913
She's
a second-degree black belt,

02:54.957 --> 02:58.395
<i>but she really is very
thoughtful, but very sharp.</i>

02:58.439 --> 03:00.615
Is she gonna, you know,
be the next president?

03:00.658 --> 03:03.879
I have no--nothing would
surprise me about Coco.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.794
- I have an internship
for the next two weeks...

03:05.837 --> 03:06.925
- Yeah.
- With Rex.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.449
I'm working
under a real estate agent.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.798
- That's very cool.
- That's the rest

03:09.841 --> 03:11.234
of my summer,
pretty much.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.801
<i>- Nicky is almost 18,</i>

03:12.844 --> 03:15.630
<i>and my gosh,
he's, like, a man.</i>

03:15.673 --> 03:17.806
You know, when your kids
go through that,

03:17.849 --> 03:21.505
you know, puberty years,
and they're kind of douchey

03:21.549 --> 03:23.290
and you gotta
get through all that,

03:23.333 --> 03:25.596
<i>what happens on the other side
of that is so cool.</i>

03:25.640 --> 03:28.512
I finally have kids that
I can hang out and talk to.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.862
- I just started
researching my essay.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.342
- Oh, for your
college application?

03:32.386 --> 03:33.952
- Oh, yeah,
I have that too.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.693
- Oh yeah, that.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.870
- Max is a very interesting,
older soul.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.829
She's very clear

03:40.872 --> 03:43.658
on who she is
and how she feels.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.487
And it's funny,
because she's kind of savage,

03:46.530 --> 03:48.315
but she's also really sweet.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.838
- Let's do it.
- Depending on my schedule.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.231
- Check your schedule, dear.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.971
- I will let you know,
get back to you.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.670
- Oh, my God.
They're turning 18.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.932
- Legal!

03:59.413 --> 04:00.892
Thank you.
- What does that mean for you?

04:00.936 --> 04:02.894
What do you want to do?
- Legal to pierce and tattoo.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.683
- What else are you
legal to--oh, vote.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.293
What else can you do at 18?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.556
- I am a legal adult.
- What?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.036
- I can hang out
with other 18-year-olds.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.951
- I don't know,
I was gonna--usually--

04:15.994 --> 04:18.345
usually people end up
not having a curfew,

04:18.388 --> 04:19.868
but we don't even
have a curfew.

04:19.911 --> 04:22.000
- No, 'cause you guys are good.
We trust you.

04:24.742 --> 04:25.700
- No, I'm not.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.530
<i>- We're eating.</i>

04:34.404 --> 04:35.840
- Okay, and now
there's a little roadwork.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.842
- Back and to the right.
- We're not gonna panic.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.453
<i>- It's so weird,
like, you driving.</i>

04:39.496 --> 04:40.715
- You know,
it's like riding a bike,

04:40.758 --> 04:42.717
but I don't want
to do that either, so.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.675
- Uh-oh!
- Gina!

04:44.719 --> 04:46.590
<i>- I'm a little bit of, like,
a nervous driver too,</i>

04:46.634 --> 04:48.026
so you have to bear with me.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.551
- Were you like that
before you lost your license?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.727
Or how long did you not drive?
- It was the not driving part.

04:52.770 --> 04:53.815
- Was it like
a year and a half?

04:53.858 --> 04:54.990
- A year--yeah,
a year and a half!

04:55.033 --> 04:55.991
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.384
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:57.427 --> 04:59.995
Gina is officially back
on the road again.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.779
- Did you think DUI?

05:01.823 --> 05:04.521
- No, I thought I was
just gonna get a ticket.

05:04.565 --> 05:07.916
- Sheriffs were going out
to arrest you today.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.005
- That's so scary, though.
- Yeah.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.312
<i>- My biggest fears
when I drive</i>

05:12.355 --> 05:14.488
include hitting other things.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.578
Oh, I hate the bikers!
I hate the bikers!

05:17.621 --> 05:20.494
I feel like, as long as
I'm not hitting other things,

05:20.537 --> 05:24.628
I am, like, achieving the goal
of driving in general.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.460
<i>Coming in hot.</i>

05:30.504 --> 05:31.809
<i>- Everything's
gonna hurt tomorrow.</i>

05:31.853 --> 05:33.681
<i>- It will.
- 'Cause I'm gonna use muscles</i>

05:33.724 --> 05:35.030
that, like--
- It's gonna, like,

05:35.073 --> 05:36.771
hurt so good, though.
- It's gonna hurt so good.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.338
- I don't think
we did this correctly.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.687
- Is this the way
you're supposed to go?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.602
- This is the first part
of the workout.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.560
- You just have to get
through the bushes.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.954
<i>Gina and I are,
like, best friends.</i>

05:45.997 --> 05:48.130
I feel like the times
that we had lows,

05:48.173 --> 05:52.090
it was because our lives
in general were at a low point.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
- Have more confidence
about sh--!

05:54.049 --> 05:56.704
- How can I when I ----ing
call you three days in a row,

05:56.747 --> 05:57.835
and you won't even
call me back?

05:57.879 --> 05:59.446
- Whatever, Emily.
I'm pissed at you!

05:59.489 --> 06:01.622
- But now, I feel like
things are just amazing

06:01.665 --> 06:05.147
because she's happy
and healthy and glowy.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.410
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.020
These look like
torture devices.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.805
<i>- They are.</i>

06:10.848 --> 06:11.936
This is Paige.
- Hi.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.069
- You're gonna hate her
by the end.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.853
- You'll love me.
- Yeah.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
She says that.
She has to say that, but.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.727
- All right, you guys.
We're gonna get started.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.643
Let those arms lengthen out.
Carefully step down.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.515
Elbows here.
Pausing at the bottom.

06:25.559 --> 06:29.171
- Show off those new tatas.
- Stick out the tatas.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.564
Shoulders down.

06:30.607 --> 06:33.480
I love the sweat, Gina.
- I love to sweat.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.046
- Are you supposed
to feel nauseous?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.526
- Yes.
- Totally.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.832
<i>- Do I like Pilates?</i>

06:37.875 --> 06:39.486
No.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.444
Will I do it for Gina?
Yes.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.881
- I call this one
"The Vagina Ripper."

06:43.925 --> 06:45.709
- I call it
"The Tampon Loser."

06:46.971 --> 06:49.713
<i>However, I'll stick
to my Peloton.</i>

06:49.757 --> 06:52.412
That hurts my vagina too,
though.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.023
- You hit this low plank
position, pause right here.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.068
And take it down.
-

06:57.112 --> 06:58.679
- You survived.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.028
- You're alive!
You're alive.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.422
- All right, I'm gonna
let you ride to the front.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.423
Ta-da!
- Yay!

07:03.466 --> 07:05.512
- Oh!

07:05.555 --> 07:07.644
- You want to take a minute?
- I got--oh!

07:07.688 --> 07:09.167
I got nauseous there
for a little bit.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.474
- Honestly, I like to take
a break too before I drive.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.693
- I have to ride with you.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.042
- I know!
- So, take as long as you need.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.609
- I don't want
to get the wheel shaking.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.610
- I'd like to make it home.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.481
Okay, so,
this is very exciting.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.484
Last summer, when they were
giving the bar exam again,

07:21.528 --> 07:23.878
it was during COVID, so they
lowered the passing score

07:23.921 --> 07:25.532
to, like, 1,390.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.447
And last time Shane took it,

07:27.490 --> 07:30.885
he scored higher
than 1,390,

07:30.928 --> 07:32.713
which means he passed...
- Oh, my God!

07:32.756 --> 07:36.107
- The California Bar Exam.

07:36.151 --> 07:39.676
And he's an attorney
in California.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.199
- Am I allowed
to make fun of him for that?

07:41.243 --> 07:42.505
- Oh, go ahead.
I don't know.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.464
- This is too much fun for me.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.467
Shane Simpson passed the bar

07:47.510 --> 07:50.861
because they lowered it
so that he could reach it.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.560
It's just--

07:53.603 --> 07:55.126
It's truly a gift.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.085
- How's Travis?
- Travis is Travis.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.782
Travis is doing really good,
actually, so.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.175
- Can I just tell you
how much I love him?

08:00.218 --> 08:01.916
- Sometimes I think
you like him more than me,

08:01.959 --> 08:03.178
and that makes me
a little jealous.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.701
- I mean, sometimes I do.
-

08:04.745 --> 08:06.747
He always puts the kids first,
no matter what,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.618
and that's been really helpful

08:08.662 --> 08:11.926
with turning things around
with Matt and I to co-parent.

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
- On Saturday,
June 22nd,

08:14.842 --> 08:17.497
your ex was arrested
in Orange County

08:17.540 --> 08:19.890

<i>- I want diplomas
on the wall,</i>

16:28.335 --> 16:29.901
<i>or you're not coming
near my face.</i>

16:29.945 --> 16:31.512
<i>- Once my hip was replaced,</i>

16:31.555 --> 16:33.731
I felt like I was
very strong physically.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.690
But in your middle age,
things start to fall

16:35.733 --> 16:37.474
and drop
and become loose.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.607
A little bit here,
a little here.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.914
So what I did was,
I wanted to remove my implants,

16:42.958 --> 16:45.917
<i>then did a fat transfer
back into my chest,</i>

16:45.961 --> 16:47.484
<i>and we did a lift.</i>

16:47.528 --> 16:50.400
<i>And I did
a mini-lower facelift.</i>

16:50.444 --> 16:52.968
Head, shoulders, knees,
and toes. It was a lot.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013
- They're in room two.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.318
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.495

I have one chin.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.498

17:01.542 --> 17:02.717

Hi!

17:02.760 --> 17:04.501

- Dr. Jen!

17:04.545 --> 17:06.677
- Thanks for coming in.
Oh, my gosh!

17:06.721 --> 17:08.201

what you usually wear?

17:08.244 --> 17:09.202

- Oh, yeah!

17:09.245 --> 17:10.377

17:10.420 --> 17:11.987

17:12.031 --> 17:13.032

- All right.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.555
Yeah, I like it.
Turn me into that.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
- Whatever machine you used--
- Yeah.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.341
- Well, I use all the machines.

17:18.385 --> 17:19.908
Do you want to put your legs
up and your feet up?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.257
- Should we?
- Yeah.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.825
- It's nice to see you again.
- You too.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.523
I saw you at---
the last time I--wow, I sank.

17:26.567 --> 17:27.829
It was
at Braunwyn's vow renewal.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.484
- Yeah! I met your kids
and your husband.

17:30.527 --> 17:31.920
- Yeah.
I have two boys and girl.

17:31.963 --> 17:34.401
- Where? At the vow renewal?
- At the vow renewal.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.707

It's Chopin.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.580

<i>She told me she was a doctor.</i>

17:41.538 --> 17:43.236
She offered me--

17:43.279 --> 17:44.541

17:44.585 --> 17:46.804
This is, like, wine

17:46.848 --> 17:48.719

17:48.763 --> 17:50.330
<i>And then,

17:50.373 --> 17:52.462
<i>and so, now I'm like,

17:52.506 --> 17:54.290

17:54.334 --> 17:55.900
- Go like this.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.467
See how it's pulling up?

17:57.511 --> 18:00.253
Just a little dab will do ya.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.820
- A dab will do?

18:02.864 --> 18:05.736
I trust you, but I'm scared
that I'm gonna look weird.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.390
- This is the horizon lines.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.609
This is the tech neck.
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.916
- We just--when I do it,
I go in the skin.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.788

- Just get rid of it!

18:13.831 --> 18:15.703
- Just wipe it out.
- We can!

18:15.746 --> 18:18.401

that ever happened to me.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.316

already at the sink,

22:58.333 --> 22:59.595

if we wanted another round.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.241

"What are you talking about?

23:38.939 --> 23:40.114

23:42.246 --> 23:45.511
to an attorney who puts himself
so much into his work

23:45.554 --> 23:48.122
is that he puts everything
into the work.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.471
Like, my mother actually
passed the bar

23:49.515 --> 23:50.603
when she was pregnant
with me,

23:50.646 --> 23:51.952
but she always told me, like,

23:51.995 --> 23:53.867
"Don't marry a doctor.
Don't marry an attorney.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.521
They're always married
to their pagers."

23:55.564 --> 23:57.479
- "Their pagers." I love that.
- But then, she finally said,

23:57.523 --> 23:59.438
"Listen, if you're gonna end up
with an attorney,

23:59.481 --> 24:01.178
"at least not one
of those ambulance chasers,

24:01.222 --> 24:02.310
'cause that's just the worst."

24:02.353 --> 24:03.572
- That didn't work out well
for you.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.139
- And I'm just like,
"Mom, meet James."

24:05.182 --> 24:07.271
- Or maybe it did.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.838
- Can we get three shots
of tequila?

24:08.882 --> 24:10.187
- Do you have a preference
on tequila?

24:10.231 --> 24:11.885
- Yes. Yes.
- Reposado.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.103
- Okay, she has a preference.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.976
- Don Julio 1942?
- Yeah, that's good. 1942.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.065
- Want to do that?
I'll put that in for you guys.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.501
Cheers.
- So lovely meeting you.

24:19.545 --> 24:22.330
- Cheers to Heather and Noella
finally meeting.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.331
- Yeah.
- Loving it.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.941
- And to a beautiful lunch.

24:24.985 --> 24:29.555
- Cheers to two girls
that have warmed my heart

24:29.598 --> 24:35.517
and make me realize
that you can start off rocky...

24:35.561 --> 24:37.911
Maybe you shouldn't judge,
Gina.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.390
Fun Emily has

24:39.434 --> 24:41.262
one ----ing glass of champagne
every time we're out.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.917
But you can end up
with a really...

24:43.960 --> 24:46.223
- Aww.
- Amazing friendship.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.182
I really haven't had
that much of a friendship

24:48.225 --> 24:49.662
with Gina and Emily
in the last year.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.925
- You called me,
completely lit up.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.535
- Miss Holier Than Thou.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.015
- I'm not holier than thou!
- Well--

24:55.058 --> 24:56.625
- When you drink,
and then you call,

24:56.669 --> 24:59.106
and then you say things, and
we do get concerned for you,

24:59.149 --> 25:00.890
'cause we really are, Shannon.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.675
<i>- But I went to New York
with Gina.</i>

25:02.718 --> 25:04.415
She and I were alone together,

25:04.459 --> 25:06.505
so we did spend a lot of time
talking,

25:06.548 --> 25:07.984
<i>having dinners together.</i>

25:08.028 --> 25:09.464
We kind of bonded there,

25:09.508 --> 25:12.685
so I'm looking at both of them
in a different light.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.122
- Shannon, we grew on you.
- Yeah.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.080
- Like barnacles.
- Yeah.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.213
- No, like roses.
- Aw.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.389
- Like roses.
- Oh, that was sweet, Shannon.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.434
- Do it.
Get over the edge, girl.

25:23.478 --> 25:24.566
What I do?
Just go?

25:24.610 --> 25:27.177
- Blegh!
- Ugh!

25:29.571 --> 25:31.486
- How long have you and Terry
been together?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.402
- So we just celebrated
22 years of marriage,

25:34.445 --> 25:37.187
but December will be 25 years
from our blind date.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.624
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.713
- That's special, you know?
- That's hard!

25:40.756 --> 25:42.671
- Very lucky.
Super grateful.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.673
- And you got a cute back end.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.414
-
- You know--

25:46.457 --> 25:49.069
- That helps marriage!
I'm just saying.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.418
- Well, you know,
no one wants to hear

25:50.461 --> 25:51.593
about married people's
sex life.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.160
- We have a sex dungeon
in our house.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.683
So, yeah,
people ask about things.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.686
You will love it.
It's very chic.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.687
- "You will love it."

25:58.731 --> 26:00.254
- Heather's like,
"I'm not going."

26:00.297 --> 26:01.429
- I'm not to your sex dungeon,

26:01.472 --> 26:03.344
but I'm happy for you
that you love it.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.436
- I'm gonna introduce Gina to
my friend Heather tomorrow.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.090
- Yeah, we're gonna go
to Javier's, right?

26:10.133 --> 26:11.265
- Right.
Yeah.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.136
- Hi, Heather.
- Shannon!

26:13.180 --> 26:14.616
How are you? <i>
- I'm good.</i>

26:14.660 --> 26:16.400
<i>- I just thought I would
call you and reach out.</i>

26:16.444 --> 26:19.012
And, if you're free,
I'd love to get together

26:19.055 --> 26:20.448
and have lunch with you
Thursday?

26:20.491 --> 26:23.320
- I had a lunch plan that day
with my friend Gina.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.235
Would it be okay
if I brought her?

26:25.279 --> 26:26.628
<i>- Yeah, of course.
Totally.</i>

26:26.672 --> 26:28.238
- Okay.
She's really sweet.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.326
- So tell me about Heather.

26:29.370 --> 26:32.547
- She is flipping funny.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.679
She is fun.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.202
She's generous,
she's giving.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.595
- Is she from Orange County?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.466
- She's from New York.
She's from New York.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.773
So you guys have that
in common.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.601
<i>I'm excited to see her.</i>

26:42.644 --> 26:44.211
- Hi. Right here.
- Perfect. Thank you.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.126
- And here's your miso sauce
over here.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.301
- Thank you.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.694
- When we went on our hike,

26:48.737 --> 26:50.478
we picked the hottest day
of the year to go walking.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.654
- Oh, my gosh, it was so hot.
- I was melting.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.308
But anyways,
you had mentioned

26:54.351 --> 26:56.527
you had not spoken to Shannon
for so long.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.051
- Oh.
- And then, she had texted you.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.140
- You know, what's funny,
I called her,

27:00.183 --> 27:02.664
and we had
a really nice conversation.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.144
- Oh, good!

27:04.187 --> 27:07.147
- And she definitely hit
the nostalgia button for me,

27:07.190 --> 27:08.801
so I'm willing
to take that chance.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.151
And I don't know, we'll see.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.761
- When Heather called me
the other day,

27:12.805 --> 27:16.156
she was walking with a friend
who says that she knows me.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.331
- Uh-oh.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.811
- When I was room mom
at the preschool.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.813
- I was walking with
a girlfriend this morning.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.249
<i>She says
you guys know each other.</i>

27:22.292 --> 27:23.816
I think your kids went
to preschool together.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.426
You know Nicole James?
- Wait a minute.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.254
Is this Nicole Wiese?

27:27.297 --> 27:28.385
- That's not her maiden name

27:28.429 --> 27:30.213
from her last husband,
I don't think.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.128
- I go, oh, my god,
Nicole Wiese.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.217
- And she goes,
"No, it's Nicole James."

27:34.261 --> 27:35.784
- I think she's just been
married a whole bunch

27:35.828 --> 27:36.785
and you just don't know.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.526
- She looked like Pam Anderson.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.136
She dated Kid Rock.

27:40.180 --> 27:43.662
I lost track of time
with her after preschool.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.229
But I was good friends
with Nicole Wiese.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.491
Was.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.668
- What's your name
before James?

27:49.711 --> 27:50.712
- Wiese.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.540
- She remembers you.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.325
- It's bugging me, because
it's like, am I losing my mind?

27:55.369 --> 27:58.720
Am I getting early--like,
I worry about Alzheimer's

27:58.764 --> 28:00.504
and early onset stuff
like that.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.723
- I don't think that's it.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.552
- The reason why
it's bothering me so much

28:04.595 --> 28:07.381
<i>is because
I don't want this girl</i>

28:07.424 --> 28:09.775
to be the person
that Heather's talking about.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.385
- I want to know.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.735
- I want to know too.
- Yeah.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.128
- All right,
I gotta pee so bad.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.782
- Okay. All right, ladies.

28:16.825 --> 28:17.870
- All right.
- So much fun.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.262
- I love you guys.
- Okay, love you.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.437
- Gotta pee.
- Need my bag.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.222
- Can you stand?
- She's such a bully.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.658
- Gina, stand.
- Look at that bully.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.094
- Okay.
- Look at your butt!

28:25.138 --> 28:27.401
- Stop it! Stop it!
- In your white jeans!

28:27.444 --> 28:28.837
Look at that!
It's all--

28:28.881 --> 28:30.491
- Emily! This is a light day
for fun, Emily.

28:30.534 --> 28:31.666
- And hot! Look!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.102
- This is a light day
for fun, Emily.

28:33.146 --> 28:35.409
- Stop it.
- Look at that! Whoo!

28:35.452 --> 28:38.194
- Stop it.
- It's fine.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.806
It's so nice.
All right.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.591
I'm not ready
to go home yet.

28:43.634 --> 28:44.635
<i>Coming up...</i>

28:44.679 --> 28:45.767
- My girlfriend Nicole.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.727
By the way,
you have the right person.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.598
- You gonna tell her?
- Stop.

28:57.605 --> 29:04.394
<i>♪</i>

29:04.438 --> 29:06.788
- This kitchen's clean.
Thanks, man.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.530
You're like a dream come true.
Seriously.

29:09.573 --> 29:10.836
<i>Do you want to talk
about nannying?</i>

29:10.879 --> 29:12.533
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.969
Doing downward dog.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.450
Okay, so basically,
I just need you

29:16.493 --> 29:18.582
to do everything
that Ryne doesn't do.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.631
<i>Ryne and I met
at a breakfast buffet.</i>

29:23.674 --> 29:25.502
<i>It was the cliche
love at first sight.</i>

29:25.546 --> 29:27.940
But it was a little tricky
because I was with somebody,

29:27.983 --> 29:29.724
and he was with somebody,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.726
and we did not
exchange phone numbers.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.510
And then a month later,
he called me.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.077
<i>I had broken up
with that somebody.</i>

29:35.121 --> 29:36.557
Hopefully,
he had broken up with--

29:36.600 --> 29:39.125
I never really asked--
with that somebody.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.780
Okay, so we know, like--

29:41.823 --> 29:43.738
oh, my gosh, look,
he's de-linting the couch.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.958
That's freaking awesome.
- Good job, Vince.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.742
<i>- Ryne and I,
we started out the gate--</i>

29:47.786 --> 29:50.223
<i>I mean, we had three babies
in 15 months.</i>

29:50.266 --> 29:51.877
<i>Vince and Cece are the twins.</i>

29:51.920 --> 29:54.009
<i>Valor is eight years old.</i>

29:54.053 --> 29:56.446
How was your sleepover?

29:56.490 --> 29:58.709
- Bye.
- Okay.

29:58.753 --> 30:03.671
How do I balance
running a business and family?

30:03.714 --> 30:05.760
Very carefully.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.240
And I don't think very well.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.155
Okay, I'm gonna change,
'cause I'm in heels.

30:09.198 --> 30:12.506
- I'm gonna go finish
de-linting the couch.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.507
- Okay.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.813
- Hey, Ry!

30:14.856 --> 30:15.857
- Hey!
- Hi!

30:15.901 --> 30:17.076
- I'm home early!
- Oh!

30:17.119 --> 30:18.512
- Oh, my God!

30:18.555 --> 30:21.210
I was born and raised
in Laguna Beach, California.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.473
<i>I'm an aesthetic
medicine physician,</i>

30:23.517 --> 30:25.084
<i>so I make people pretty
for a living.</i>

30:25.127 --> 30:26.955
<i>I also have 20 years
of education</i>

30:26.999 --> 30:29.044
<i>and ten years of experience
behind it.</i>

30:29.088 --> 30:31.917
I see a lot of people,
and I happen to know more

30:31.960 --> 30:35.137
than I probably should on the
happenings of Orange County.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.052
You're gonna have
the best-looking neck in town.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.097
- Mm-hmm.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.794
- You see a girl,
and then they say,

30:39.838 --> 30:41.796
"Oh, my boyfriend's gonna
give you a credit card,"

30:41.840 --> 30:43.276
and then you look
at the credit card,

30:43.319 --> 30:46.888
and you're like, "Oh,
that's someone else's husband.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.629
We'll keep that one on file."

30:48.672 --> 30:51.066
Ryne, don't judge me.
I might have a glass of wine.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.201
- Stop.
Stop, I "do it every night."

30:55.244 --> 30:56.898
Can you open this?
- I don't know how.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.204
- You have to--
you just, like--

30:58.247 --> 31:00.293
I just need a big, strong man
to decork it.

31:00.336 --> 31:01.816
- Vince!
- What?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.383
- Need a big, strong man.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.907
<i>- Ryne and I do have an
unconventional relationship.</i>

31:05.951 --> 31:08.257
<i>He owns a company that does
high-end vacation rentals,</i>

31:08.301 --> 31:12.218
<i>catering to a higher-end clientele.</i>

31:12.261 --> 31:13.872
Oh, my gosh!

31:13.915 --> 31:15.917
But before that,
he was full-time father.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.572
<i>And he always puts being
a father before anything else,</i>

31:18.615 --> 31:20.226
sometimes before
being a husband,

31:20.269 --> 31:23.794
which is probably
our biggest conflict.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.144
When are you leaving
for your trip?

31:25.187 --> 31:26.797
- This week.
- Well, that's good to know.

31:26.841 --> 31:27.929
- Yeah.
- So you're gonna leave me

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
with three kids?
- Right.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.933
But you don't have
to do anything.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.805
Well, you're not normally here,
so it would--it would be fine.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.200
Unless you fire Caitlin.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.855
- I'm not gonna fire--never.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.456
both good and bad.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.590
I'm open! I'm open!

40:18.633 --> 40:20.722
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:20.766 --> 40:22.507
Stella, go like this
to Adeline.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.639
- Go.
- Point at her.

40:24.683 --> 40:27.294
- I can't change the past
and what I did.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.079
I can only try and make
the here and now better.

40:30.123 --> 40:33.561
- The last thing in the world
we want you guys to worry about

40:33.605 --> 40:37.435
is whether we're gonna
stay together as a family.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.482
It's a part
of my family's history.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.398
And, um...

40:44.442 --> 40:46.313
all this is being triggered.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.880
I have not been
in this neighborhood once,

40:47.923 --> 40:49.490
so it's been very--
- Here, you need this.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.187
- Since you moved out?
- No.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.799
- Here. Drink this.
- Until recently.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.366
When you say--
I see the refrigerator drawers,

40:56.410 --> 40:58.847
and I see all the same things
that we had,

40:58.891 --> 41:00.370
and then,
it makes me think

41:00.414 --> 41:01.676
that that wasn't even part
of my life.

41:01.720 --> 41:02.808
It seems, like, so long ago.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.287
- Like a different lifetime.
- Yeah.

41:04.331 --> 41:05.680
- That's crazy.

41:05.724 --> 41:08.422
<i>So now, we're gonna this way.
- Oh, my God.</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:10.424
<i>- This is where
the magic happens.</i>

41:10.468 --> 41:12.252
- I feel like
your bed is small, though.

41:12.295 --> 41:13.514
- No, it's a California King.

41:13.558 --> 41:15.690
<i>But everything shrinks
in here, so--</i>

41:15.734 --> 41:17.213
<i>- Yeah.</i>

41:17.257 --> 41:19.259
<i>- A lot of furniture
had to be custom-made.</i>

41:19.302 --> 41:21.348
<i>Now I'm--take you
in the bathroom.</i>

41:21.391 --> 41:22.654
<i>- Wow.
- Oh, I love it.</i>

41:22.697 --> 41:24.133
- This is the best part
of the house.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.439
So when you come
out of the shower...

41:25.483 --> 41:27.789
- Are there hot towels
in there? Heather.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.487
- Do you want
to touch one, Gina?

41:29.530 --> 41:31.576
- I don't even know if I want
to be friends with you anymore.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.403
- You do. You want
to take a shower in my shower.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.753
- I do, and I want
to feel your hot towels.

41:34.796 --> 41:36.319
- You do.
- I do.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.452
I want to feel your hot towels.
- Come feel my hot towels.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.106
- Oh, that's nice.
It's really nice.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.282
- It's so good, and it's nice
'cause you just open the door,

41:42.325 --> 41:43.675
and then, they're right here.
- Yeah.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.328
- And they're so delicious,
aren't they?

41:45.372 --> 41:48.244
- They're amazing.
They're amazing.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.594
Is this your closet?
- This is my closet.

41:49.637 --> 41:51.378
- This is your closet.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.380
What the [BLEEP], Heather?

41:53.423 --> 41:54.773
<i>Holy sh--.</i>

41:54.816 --> 41:56.688
<i>Is this actually
how you keep your clothes?</i>

41:56.731 --> 41:58.254
<i>- She has the ladder
that does around.</i>

41:58.298 --> 41:59.342
<i>- Well, you need the ladder</i>

41:59.386 --> 42:00.866
'cause I have
to pull stuff down.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.607
- Oh, my God. That was my
dream, and I told Travis that.

42:02.650 --> 42:03.651
And I--
- Okay.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.348
- It's very Belle.
it's very Belle.

42:05.392 --> 42:07.220
<i>- What's Belle?
- "Beauty and the Beast."</i>

42:07.263 --> 42:08.569
- Well, you can have it too.
It's okay.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.223
- I--one day.
- Okay.

42:10.266 --> 42:11.920
<i>- This is inspiration.</i>

42:11.964 --> 42:13.487
Everything's so organized.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.663
<i>And there's, like,
clear windows.</i>

42:15.707 --> 42:19.624
Clearly somebody has washed
all of them on a regular basis.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.495
Yeah. This is great.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.932
<i>That's just the house.</i>

42:23.976 --> 42:26.631

42:59.141 --> 43:01.666

I'm gonna open a bottle
of champagne right away.

43:07.149 --> 43:08.890
- Feed me. Feed me.
- Will you sit

43:08.934 --> 43:10.718

really quick?

43:10.762 --> 43:11.937
- Love you, my dahling.

43:11.980 --> 43:13.199
- How's the baby?
- Oh, my God.

43:13.242 --> 43:15.244

I'm kind of in love with him.

43:15.288 --> 43:16.637
I'm just like,
look at your face.

43:16.681 --> 43:18.204

- He's so cute.

43:18.247 --> 43:21.076

43:36.831 --> 43:38.180

your mom's gonna stay."

43:38.224 --> 43:39.704
It wasn't even,
like, a debate.

43:39.747 --> 43:42.271
My mom's my best friend.
It's very dorky to admit that.

43:42.315 --> 43:43.664
- Where do we want to eat?
Outside?

43:43.708 --> 43:45.057
- Are you gonna need help
with this one?

43:45.100 --> 43:46.275
- It's not even--no.
- It's, like,

43:46.319 --> 43:47.755
heavier than you are.
- No! It's not.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.801
It's just a couple
little things here and there.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.542
- It's fabulous.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.849
When I first met you--
you stand out to everybody

43:54.893 --> 43:56.155
that I've ever met
in Orange County.

43:56.198 --> 43:57.983
- Aw.
- It's true, though.

43:58.026 --> 43:59.375
All the PTA mom--

43:59.419 --> 44:02.117
I call it the Lululemon,
like, ponytail brigade.

44:02.161 --> 44:05.164
It's very cookie-cutter.
It's very standard issue.

44:05.207 --> 44:07.732
When you kind of meet one,
you've met them all.

44:07.775 --> 44:10.299
Literally and figuratively,
I feel like the black sheep.

44:10.343 --> 44:11.866
<i>I was a welfare baby,</i>

44:11.910 --> 44:13.955
<i>but my mother built
a law practice in Palm Desert,</i>

44:13.999 --> 44:16.088
so I kind of got to see
both sides

44:16.131 --> 44:17.785
as a--as a child growing up.

44:17.829 --> 44:19.613
It's just
that feeling of, like,

44:19.657 --> 44:21.702
oh, I have to, like,
dumb myself down

44:21.746 --> 44:23.138
to be with these people.

44:23.182 --> 44:24.836
And, like,
the moment I met you,

44:24.879 --> 44:26.664
I could just be myself.

44:26.707 --> 44:29.057
I'm the best friend
that you could ever have.

44:29.101 --> 44:31.059
I am a bad bitch
to the freaking end.

44:31.103 --> 44:35.020
But I also have some bodies
buried of ex-friends.

44:39.372 --> 44:41.853
- You have a date night
with your handsome hubby,

44:41.896 --> 44:43.289

- Oh, I love him.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.986
Kiss him and love him for me.
- Love Sweet James.

44:45.030 --> 44:46.684
- You have an amazing husband.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.816
Like, every successful man

44:48.860 --> 44:51.123
needs a confident,
strong woman.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.647
- Now he's a big deal,
'cause of my blowjobs.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.650
And my love, and my styling,
and my taking care of things,

44:56.694 --> 44:58.608
and my being a spendthrift,
and my being a bad bitch.

44:58.652 --> 45:00.828
- "Because of my blowjobs."
- They're phenomenal.

45:00.872 --> 45:03.135

trouble on the down low

47:08.390 --> 47:10.915
so that not everybody
is privy to it.

47:10.958 --> 47:14.135

agreed not to say anything.</i>

47:48.213 --> 47:50.519
- Right. I encouraged Shannon
to do the right thing

47:50.563 --> 47:52.130

was not at the table.

47:52.173 --> 47:53.914

47:55.350 --> 47:58.092
When we get there,
if anything's going on,

47:58.136 --> 48:00.181
<i>it's going to look like

48:00.225 --> 48:03.097
- I don't understand
what her endgame is here.

48:03.141 --> 48:06.840
Like, I'm not gonna go out
of my way to say anything,

48:09.538 --> 48:10.975

'cause whenever I ring it,
no one ever brings it.

48:53.756 --> 48:54.888
- Oh, no way.
- Oh, my God.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.324
I love you so much.
- Yeah, of course.

48:56.368 --> 48:57.369
- Thanks, Max.
- Enjoy.

48:57.412 --> 48:58.805
- Perfect.
I'll see you downstairs.

48:58.848 --> 49:00.676
Hi, everybody.
- Hi. How are you?

49:00.720 --> 49:02.548
- Hi, Heather. How are you?
- Happy party day.

49:02.591 --> 49:04.332
- Happy party day. Welcome.
- Look at you.

49:04.376 --> 49:07.335
You guys know the flow
of the party pretty much?

49:07.379 --> 49:08.728
<i>Everyone's gonna arrive,</i>

49:08.771 --> 49:10.686
and we're gonna do cocktails
in the salon,

49:10.730 --> 49:12.384
not to be confused
with the sa-LON,

49:12.427 --> 49:13.863
which is the beauty salon.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.735
This is the SAL-on, which is
right outside the dining.

49:15.778 --> 49:17.563
When the sunset
is just perfect...

49:17.606 --> 49:19.608
Maybe someone wants
to bang the gong...

49:19.652 --> 49:21.828
We'll have appetizers,
lots of food...

49:21.871 --> 49:23.873
Vegan Jell-O shots, and they're
kind of like a push pop.

49:23.917 --> 49:25.527
Hi!
Hi!

49:25.571 --> 49:27.355
- You look gorgeous. Hi!

49:27.399 --> 49:28.878
Then we're gonna go
into the dining room...

49:28.922 --> 49:30.010
Miso soup...
Wagyu beef for Jen,

49:30.054 --> 49:32.230
'cause she doesn't
restricted carbs.

49:32.273 --> 49:33.796
Should I go into
what restricted carbs are?

49:33.840 --> 49:35.973
Bento boxes.
It's gonna be great.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.454
Your horse did so well!
- I know.

49:39.498 --> 49:41.021
- Wait! Give me the info.

49:41.065 --> 49:43.719
- We had three running
in one day.

49:43.763 --> 49:46.287
- Hi. I'm still in--
I know, it's a lot.

49:46.331 --> 49:48.420
- Oh, my gosh.
You look gorgeous!

49:48.463 --> 49:50.422
I love that you did!
You look beautiful!

49:50.465 --> 49:52.380
- It's fun. Thank you.
- Welcome.

49:52.424 --> 49:54.513
You might have
some familiar faces over here.

49:54.556 --> 49:56.819
- I know!
- Shannon, you know--

49:56.863 --> 49:59.039
- Hi! How are you?
- Nancy. Sarah.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.519
- How are you?
- Hi.

50:00.562 --> 50:02.347
- Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

50:02.390 --> 50:04.479
- What are we drinking?
Anything you want.

50:04.523 --> 50:05.698
- This is tequila,

50:05.741 --> 50:07.265
sort of infused--
- Okay, that's perfect.

50:07.308 --> 50:08.788
Thank you so much.

50:08.831 --> 50:11.965
- Hello.
Hi. I'm Jenny.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.619
- Oh, hi, Jen!
- Nice to meet you!

50:13.662 --> 50:15.012
- I'm Heather.
It's so nice to meet you!

50:15.055 --> 50:16.665
- I'm gonna give you a hug.
Thank you so much

50:16.709 --> 50:17.840
for having us.
- Yeah, of course.

50:17.884 --> 50:19.016
- Hi.
- Hi, Shannon!

50:19.059 --> 50:21.061
- How are you?
- We met at the renewal.

50:21.105 --> 50:22.367
- Who had a vow renewal?

50:22.410 --> 50:24.499
- Braunwyn had a vow renewal.
- Oh.

50:24.543 --> 50:27.067
- Apparently,
I met Dr. Jen Armstrong

50:27.111 --> 50:28.808
at Braunwyn's vow renewal.

50:28.851 --> 50:29.939
What is this?

50:29.983 --> 50:31.767
- Vodka grapefruit.
- Three of those.

50:31.811 --> 50:34.074
That whole thing
about the--

50:34.118 --> 50:36.772
the whole thing
about the--the thing.

50:36.816 --> 50:39.079
To know--to know what her...

50:39.123 --> 50:40.994
<i>I don't remember
meeting her, so.</i>

50:45.477 --> 50:47.348
- Hello, hello.

50:47.392 --> 50:48.784
- Hi! Oh, my God.
- You look so beautiful!

50:48.828 --> 50:51.787
- You look so fancy.
- Hi. How are you?

50:51.831 --> 50:53.659
- You're so Audrey Hepburn.
I love it.

50:53.702 --> 50:55.008
- Thank you!
You look so gorgeous!

50:55.052 --> 50:56.357
- Thank you.
- Come in.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.316
Hi!

50:59.969 --> 51:01.449
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hi.

51:01.493 --> 51:02.755
- Hi! How are you?

51:02.798 --> 51:04.974
Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.628
Thank you for inviting me.
- Yes!

51:06.672 --> 51:08.413
Thank you for coming.
- I'm excited to be here.

51:08.456 --> 51:09.979
- I got to see you
for, like, three minutes...

51:10.023 --> 51:11.503
- I know.
- At Javier's the other night.

51:11.546 --> 51:13.679
- And then,
I think you paid my bill.

51:13.722 --> 51:15.637
- As a matter of fact,
Shannon already paid me back.

51:16.899 --> 51:18.814
- Hi!

51:18.858 --> 51:20.686

51:20.729 --> 51:22.905
- How's it going?
You look good.

51:22.949 --> 51:24.472
- I think I need
a little more right here.

51:24.516 --> 51:25.473
- Yeah, we'll touch.
- Okay.

51:25.517 --> 51:26.518
- We'll touch.

51:26.561 --> 51:27.823
- Hey, Emily.

51:27.867 --> 51:29.608
- Oh, hi, Shannon.
I didn't know that was you!

51:29.651 --> 51:32.045
- You didn't recognize me
with the super long hair?

51:32.089 --> 51:33.568
- Oh, my God!

51:33.612 --> 51:35.353
- I thought fun Shannon
would come out tonight.

51:35.396 --> 51:36.615

It looks good.

<i>- Shannon is just
not self-aware.</i>

51:38.617 --> 51:39.966
She was very eager

51:40.009 --> 51:43.665
to share her juicy gossip
about this girl, Nicole.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.667

have been in this chair.

we'd be married 13 years?

I was just declined.

53:18.934 --> 53:21.067

That was a block.

pornography as a gift.
