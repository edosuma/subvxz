WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.537
MAN, I CAN'T WAIT
TO START WATCHING

00:03.537 --> 00:06.006
ALL THOSE GAMES
ON THE PREMIUM PACKAGE.

00:06.006 --> 00:10.078
MY PAPERWORK SAYS YOU ONLY PAID
FOR THE BASIC PACKAGE.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.680
HUH. I WONDER
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.416
BY THE WAY,
I GOT YOU A BEER, MAN.

00:15.416 --> 00:18.419
IT'S A HOT DAY TO BE PUTTING UP
A SATELLITE DISH.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.555
THANKS, BUT I CAN'T DRINK
WHILE I'M WORKING.

00:21.555 --> 00:25.659
YOU KNOW, WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING,
PEOPLE DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.162
I'M NOT GAY.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.930
WELL, NEITHER AM I,

00:29.930 --> 00:33.367
BUT IF I WAS, I COULD NEVER
LAND A STUD LIKE YOU.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.736
WHAT IS THAT,
A UTILITY BELT? NICE.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.440
IF YOU WANT THE PREMIUM PACKAGE,
YOU GOTTA PAY FOR IT.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.409
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
TAKE IT EASY. RELAX.

00:41.409 --> 00:47.415
I'M JUST GONNA PUT THE BEER DOWN
HERE ON TOP OF THIS $20 BILL.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.619
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE MY JOB
OVER $20 AND A BEER.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.622
FINE. BE THAT WAY THEN.
THERE'S A BEEHIVE UP THERE.

00:54.622 --> 00:58.426
I'M NOT GONNA TELL
YOU WHERE IT IS NOW.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.462
SIR, I'M ALLERGIC TO BEES.
I COULD DIE.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.697
ALL RIGHT THEN.
IT'S RIGHT THERE, BABY.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.269
CAN YOU HANG HERE
WITH THE SATELLITE GUY?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.171
I'M GONNA GO RUNNING.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.539
OH, OH, OH, ANGIE.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.142
REMEMBER HOW YOU GOT US
ALL THOSE FREE CHANNELS

01:14.142 --> 01:16.310
FROM THE CABLE GUY?

01:16.310 --> 01:18.546
I AM NOT GONNA FLIRT
WITH SOME STRANGER

01:18.546 --> 01:20.881
JUST SO YOU CAN GET
MORE SPORTS CHANNELS.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.650
THIS ISN'T JUST FOR ME.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.253
THERE ARE ALL THOSE
LADY CHANNELS OUT THERE

01:25.253 --> 01:27.054
WITH STRONG WOMEN...

01:27.054 --> 01:30.291
EARNING RESPECT
IN A MAN'S WORLD.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.961
NOW YOU GET OUT THERE
AND SHAKE IT.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.130
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MY BEST GIRL.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.599
GO ON THE STROLL FOR DADDY.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.570
ALL RIGHT.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.673
300 CHANNELS
COMING RIGHT UP.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.176
I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE
A HEART CONDITION.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.578
HEY, BUT KEEP IT CLASSY.
WE'RE STILL MARRIED.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.347
YOU WANT
THE CHANNELS OR NOT?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.449
ALL RIGHT,
THEN GO AHEAD.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.219
I'M ABOUT
TO GO FOR A RUN.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.222
YOU DON'T MIND
IF I STRETCH HERE, DO YOU?

02:01.222 --> 02:04.192
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.194
I WONDER IF THERE'S
A YOGA CHANNEL

02:06.194 --> 02:08.196
ON THE PREMIUM PACKAGE.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.498
THAT'D BE NICE.

02:10.498 --> 02:13.167
THERE IS.
PAY FOR IT, AND YOU'LL GET IT.

02:15.636 --> 02:21.809
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE
DO FAVORS FOR EACH OTHER.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.745
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.147
THERE'S A DEAD BIRD
IN YOUR GUTTER.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.317
I'LL THROW IT AWAY
FOR YOU.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.459
SO?

02:38.459 --> 02:42.230
HE DIDN'T GO FOR IT.
HE MUST BE GAY.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.800
I WISH. I'D BE WATCHING
THE LAKERS RIGHT NOW.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.805
FINALLY, WE'RE GETTING
SATELLITE TV.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.141
ARE WE GETTING
ALL THE MOVIE CHANNELS?

02:54.141 --> 02:56.043
AHEM. NAH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.845
I'M NOT PAYING
FOR ALL THAT.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.515
WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PAY FOR IT. (clicks tongue)

03:04.552 --> 03:07.855
THEY SAID WE'RE NOT GETTING
ANY OF THE MOVIE CHANNELS.

03:07.855 --> 03:12.360
I'M SO BUMMED... ALLEN.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.862
OH, "E-N"
INSTEAD OF "A-N."

03:14.862 --> 03:17.631
SOMEONE LIKES
TO BREAK THE RULES.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.934
YOU'RE REALLY SUPPOSED
TO PAY FOR IT.

03:20.934 --> 03:25.673
BUT I'M JUST A COLLEGE GIRL.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.842
THE ONLY THING I DO FOR FUN
IS GO TO PARTIES.

03:28.842 --> 03:33.781
MAYBE YOU COULD GO WITH ME
SOMETIME, ALLEN WITH AN "E-N."

03:35.649 --> 03:38.786
I GUESS I COULD GIVE YOU ALL
THE CHANNELS FREE FOR A YEAR.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.224
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU ROCK!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.260
SO WHEN'S THIS PARTY?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.729
OH,
I'LL MEET YOU OVER THERE.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.499
I GOT THE CHANNELS.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.804
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU USE
YOUR LOOKS TO GET THINGS,

03:56.804 --> 03:59.540
YOU'RE
JUST DEMEANING YOURSELF.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.878
IT'S ONLY DEMEANING
WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK, BABY.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.251
I DON'T GET IT. WHY DID IT
WORK FOR HER AND NOT ME?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.287
IT ALWAYS WORKS FOR ME.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.956
COME ON.
LOOK, WE DID IT AS A TEAM.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.659
I WAS STARTING PITCHER,
YOU WERE THE MIDDLE RELIEF,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.494
AND VERONICA
WAS OUR CLOSER.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.797
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR SPORTS METAPHORS.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.400
THEN I'LL PUT IT
IN CHEERLEADING TERMS.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.869
YOU KNOW WHEN
THEY MAKE A PYRAMID?
MM-HMM.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.872
WE'RE THE FAT CHICKS
ON THE BOTTOM.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.276
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN UP.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.978
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
AGAIN.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.614
THE BOSS IS HAVING
HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS WEEKEND,

04:40.614 --> 04:43.651
AND HE WANTS EVERYONE
TO COME... IN COSTUME.

04:43.651 --> 04:47.020
COSTUMES? WHAT ARE WE, 8?

04:47.020 --> 04:51.825
LET'S JUST BE THANKFUL IT'S NOT
A PAJAMA PARTY THIS TIME.

04:51.825 --> 04:56.163
WE ALL REMEMBER
ERNIE'S PEEKABOO ACCIDENT.

04:56.163 --> 05:00.668
CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK YOU
20 MINUTES TO SAY SOMETHING.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.576
WOW, MOM, YOU FINALLY HOOKED
AN RICH, OLD GUY.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.812
(loudly) DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOUR WALLET IS, SIR?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.047
I CHANGED
MY COMMUNITY SERVICE.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.884
I GOT SICK OF PICKING UP TRASH
OFF THE FREEWAY,

05:16.884 --> 05:19.853
SO NOW I TAKE OLD PEOPLE
TO THEIR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.856
WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?
I'M GETTING CLOSE.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.358
I JUST STARTED.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.626
OH.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.332
HEY, ANGIE.
HEY, ANGIE.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.202
ERNIE.
WHITE WINE, PLEASE.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.205
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE MALL TODAY.

05:38.205 --> 05:42.810
OH, A STORY ABOUT THE MALL--
WOW, I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
UH, TEQUILA.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.516
VERONICA AND I
WERE SHOPPING,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.518
AND SOME WEIRD GUY
WAS FOLLOWING US.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.020
WE GO TRY CLOTHES ON
IN THE DRESSING ROOM,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.523
AND HE PEEKS AT VERONICA
WHILE SHE'S CHANGING.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.025
DID YOU TELL SECURITY?

05:58.025 --> 06:01.629
NO, I WAS TOO UPSET. HE DIDN'T
EVEN TRY TO LOOK IN MY ROOM.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.564
ANGIE,
ARE YOU ON THIS AGAIN?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.733
LOOK, WE TALKED ABOUT IT
LAST NIGHT.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.869
YOU LOOK GREAT, BABY.
THIS IS ALL IN YOUR HEAD.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.672
(men catcalling and hooting)

06:17.044 --> 06:18.846
WAS THAT IN MY HEAD?

06:18.846 --> 06:21.615
BECAUSE WHEN I WALKED IN,
THEY BARELY SAID HI.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.617
ANGIE,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

06:23.617 --> 06:26.386
OKAY, YOU'RE THE BOSS' WIFE.
VERONICA--SHE'S SINGLE.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.188
EH, ERNIE SAID HI TO YOU.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.459
THAT DOESN'T COUNT. HE'S HAD
A CRUSH ON ME SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

06:31.459 --> 06:35.429
I THINK I'M LOSING IT.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.465
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

06:37.465 --> 06:41.569
FIRST THE SATELLITE GUY,
THEN THE PERVERT AT THE MALL...

06:41.569 --> 06:43.571
I'M GETTING OLDER.

06:43.571 --> 06:48.408
OKAY. NO MORE CARBS,
GO TO THE GYM TWICE A DAY,

06:48.408 --> 06:51.545
AND I MIGHT NEED
TO START BOTOX.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.047
ANGIE, THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.716
LISTEN TO ME.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.986
YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL
AS A WOMAN COULD POSSIBLY BE

06:58.986 --> 07:00.621
FOR YOUR AGE.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.564
WHAT DID I SAY?!

07:12.533 --> 07:14.468
SO...

07:14.468 --> 07:18.071
TROUBLE IN PARADISE,
GEORGE?

07:18.071 --> 07:21.509
GINA, NOT NOW.
REALLY, NOT EVER.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.713
ALL I CAN SAY IS
IF YOUR MARRIAGE GOES SOUTH

07:25.713 --> 07:28.148
AND YOU END UP
ON THE REBOUND...

07:28.148 --> 07:30.183
BOING, BOING.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.657
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:39.693 --> 07:42.596
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:42.596 --> 07:44.164
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:58.712 --> 08:01.849
HEY, MAX, COME HERE.
I WANT TO TRY THIS THING OUT.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.853
(imitates heart beating)

08:07.688 --> 08:11.358
(imitates
heart beating rapidly)

08:11.358 --> 08:13.260
IT'S GOING CRAZY.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.299
WHAT? ONE OF THE GUYS FROM
SHIPPING ASKED ME TO THE PARTY.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.101
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK

08:21.101 --> 08:23.236
OF MY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
OUTFIT?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.008
I THINK NEXT YEAR
FOR MY BIRTHDAY,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.243
I WANT TO HAVE
A COSTUME PARTY,

08:30.243 --> 08:33.046
AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE PERSON INVITED. HELLO.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.285
I'D SEND YOU
TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW,

08:38.285 --> 08:40.788
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'D BE A PUNISHMENT.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.128
DO YOU GUYS HAVE
A PICNIC BASKET I COULD USE?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.430
YEAH.
IT'S IN THE GARAGE.
COOL.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.732
OH, HEY, VERONICA.
HMM?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.734
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.736
YOU KNOW, ANGIE'S GOING
THROUGH SOME STUFF,

08:55.736 --> 08:58.105
AND, UH... SHE'S NOT FEELING
SO PRETTY RIGHT NOW.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.107
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.076
I KNOW, BUT SHE DOESN'T FEEL
GORGEOUS BECAUSE SHE THINKS

09:03.076 --> 09:05.212
YOU'RE ATTRACTING
ALL THE ATTENTION, SO...

09:05.212 --> 09:08.415
TONIGHT AT THE PARTY,
COULD YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,

09:08.415 --> 09:10.417
TONE IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.219
"TONE IT DOWN"?

09:12.219 --> 09:15.723
YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST NEED SOME HELP. HERE.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.535
UNCLE GEORGE...

09:28.535 --> 09:30.604
NOW NO ONE
CAN SEE MY BODY.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.641
I THINK YOU'LL GET BY
ON YOUR PERSONALITY.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.877
YOU LIKE A CHALLENGE,
DON'T YOU?

09:40.648 --> 09:43.083
IN ALL MY YEARS
IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION,

09:43.083 --> 09:49.790
I'VE NEVER SEEN A NURSE GET
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER EVERY DAY!

09:49.790 --> 09:52.893
OKAY, I FORGIVE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU SAID.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.896
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR THAT
I'M YOUNG EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.331
HOW ABOUT ON THE HOUR?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.834
IF IT FEELS RIGHT.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.237
OH, HEY, BENNY.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.674
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO THE COSTUME PARTY?

10:06.674 --> 10:09.176
NAH, I'M DRIVING
SENIORS AROUND TONIGHT.

10:09.176 --> 10:13.781
THEY'RE OUT FRONT.
I'M TAKING MY DINNER BREAK.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.750
SO YOU TOTALLY
LEFT THEM IN THE VAN?

10:16.750 --> 10:19.086
WHAT IF THEY WANDER OFF?

10:19.086 --> 10:22.355
NO, NO. I TOOK AWAY ALL
OF THEIR CANES AND WALKERS.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.730
THOSE THREE STEPS
DOWN TO THE GROUND

10:29.730 --> 10:32.299
MIGHT AS WELL BE
THE GRAND CANYON.

10:34.534 --> 10:38.038
I DON'T KNOW HOW FUN
THIS PARTY IS GONNA BE NOW.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.408
UNCLE GEORGE WANTS ME TO STAY
ALL COVERED UP FOR AUNT ANGIE.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.710
WHY?

10:42.710 --> 10:45.312
MM, SHE'S FEELING
THREATENED AND OLD.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.817
WELL,
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.855
HEY, OLD LADY,
THE BUS IS LEAVING.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.066
I-I MISTOOK YOU

11:06.066 --> 11:09.469
FOR ONE OF THE SENIOR CITIZENS
THAT I DRIVE.

11:09.469 --> 11:13.506
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.275
OH, HEY, DON'T WORRY.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.445
I WOULD NEVER TELL HER
WHAT YOU SAID TO VERONICA.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.815
OH, WHOOPS! I AM JUST
STEPPING IN IT LEFT AND RIGHT.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.155
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO VERONICA?

11:30.623 --> 11:34.394
I JUST TOLD HER TO--TO--
TO TONE IT DOWN.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.931
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUNG AND FRESH,
AND YOU'RE OLD AND NASTY.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.533
THERE, LIKE A BAND-AID...

11:40.533 --> 11:42.469
RIP IT OFF!

11:48.708 --> 11:51.812
SO YOU DO THINK
I'M LOOKING OLDER.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.147
NO, ANGIE,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.284
THEN WHY ELSE WOULD YOU TELL
VERONICA TO TONE IT DOWN?

11:57.284 --> 12:00.821
THAT'S IT. I PEAKED.
SOON I'LL BE NOTHING BUT...

12:00.821 --> 12:04.157
CROW'S-FEET
AND SPIDER VEINS.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.327
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SEE ME NAKED
WITH THE LIGHTS ON AGAIN.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.430
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA. STOP, ANGIE, ALL RIGHT?

12:10.430 --> 12:13.133
THIS IS CRAZY.
THERE'S NOT A MAN IN THE WORLD

12:13.133 --> 12:15.535
WHO WOULDN'T THINK
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.871
HEY, CHECK IT OUT!
(grunts)

12:21.842 --> 12:23.610
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:23.610 --> 12:26.847
DUDE, THAT DIDN'T FIT YOU
WHEN YOU WERE 10.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.416
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF ANGIE'S COSTUME?

12:30.951 --> 12:34.121
OH, WELL,
IT'S PRETTY REALISTIC.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.123
I MEAN,
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE

12:36.123 --> 12:39.259
THE LADY THAT COMES OVER
AND HELPS ME CLEAN UP MY MOM.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.032
EH, EH, BUT--BUT--BUT--
BUT HOT, RIGHT? HOT.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.135
WELL, IF YOU LIKE NURSES,
I GUESS.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.941
EVERY MAN IN THE WORLD,
HUH?

12:59.246 --> 13:02.282
YOU DROOL OVER MY WIFE
EVERY DAY,

13:02.282 --> 13:05.518
AND THE ONE TIME I WANT YOU
TO TELL HER THAT SHE'S HOT,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.754
YOU DON'T DO IT!

13:07.754 --> 13:10.623
I WAS TRYING NOT TO STARE,

13:10.623 --> 13:12.993
NOT IN THIS COSTUME!

13:25.973 --> 13:29.943
OH, HELL, NO.

13:32.045 --> 13:35.715
GEORGE,
I REALIZED I STILL GOT IT.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.851
I JUST WASN'T SHOWING IT.

13:37.851 --> 13:41.989
WELL, YOU'RE NOT SHOWING IT
TO EVERYBODY THAT I WORK WITH.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.058
I AM GOING TO THIS PARTY.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.694
THEN I'M NOT GOING.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.031
FINE.
I'LL GO WITHOUT YOU.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.103
BENNY, CAN YOU DROP ME OFF
AT THE PARTY?

13:56.103 --> 13:58.838
SEEMS THAT GEORGE HAS ALREADY
PUT HIS FOOT DOWN,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.910
WHICH MEANS IT'S YOUR CALL.
I'M READY WHENEVER YOU ARE.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.145
DON'T DO THIS.
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT

14:05.145 --> 14:08.215
IF I SHOWED UP AT YOUR WORK
DRESSED AS A HOT NURSE?

14:09.749 --> 14:12.886
BELIEVE ME, I'VE GOT THE THIGHS
FOR FISHNETS. WATCH OUT.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.555
AND THE CALVES FOR HEELS.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.592
I MADE A MISTAKE.
THIS ISN'T MY HOUSE AT ALL.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.198
BENNY, START THE BUS.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.234
COME ON, ANGIE.
THIS IS STUPID.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.803
YOU'RE GONNA EMBARRASS ME IN
FRONT OF EVERYBODY I WORK WITH.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.605
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE EMBARRASSED.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.608
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD THAT
YOUR WIFE LOOKS SO GOOD.

14:35.608 --> 14:39.346
EXCUSE ME, NURSE.
I'M READY FOR MY SPONGE BATH.

14:41.081 --> 14:45.052
KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS,
ORVILLE REDENBACHER.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.719
DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.923
ANGIE, IS THIS THE KIND
OF ATTENTION YOU WANT?

14:49.923 --> 14:51.858
I CAN'T HELP IT
IF I TURN HEADS.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.793
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY
MY WHOLE LIFE,

14:53.793 --> 14:55.595
AND THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA STAY.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.499
WE'RE COMING UP ON THE CORNER
OF EGO AND DENIAL.

14:59.499 --> 15:04.671
ANYONE NEED TO GET OFF HERE?
ANGIE?

15:04.671 --> 15:09.642
HEY, BAT, EYES ON THE ROAD,
WINGS ON THE WHEEL.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.679
I AM NOT IN DENIAL.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.449
I'M GONNA LOOK GOOD NO MATTER
HOW OLD I GET

15:16.449 --> 15:19.019
BECAUSE AGE
IS A STATE OF MIND.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.121
AMEN TO THAT.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.225
NICE BELLY SHIRT.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.861
IT BRINGS OUT
THOSE LIVER SPOTS.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.364
SOME PEOPLE
JUST DON'T GET IT,

15:31.364 --> 15:34.301
BUT YOU'RE LIKE ME.
YOU KNOW YOU LOOK GREAT,

15:34.301 --> 15:37.370
AND EVERYBODY AROUND
IS JUST JEALOUS.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.548
WELL,
THERE'S THE FINISH LINE.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.451
YOU WANNA KEEP RUNNING?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.920
NO.

15:53.920 --> 15:58.725
ANGIE,
WE'RE GONNA GET OLDER.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.328
THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP IT.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.596
THAT'S EASY
FOR A MAN TO SAY.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.598
WOMEN ARE JUDGED
BY THEIR LOOKS.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.236
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD WE HAVE IT.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.305
I USED TO JUST ROLL OUT OF BED
AND LOOK GOOD.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.243
NOW I HAVE TO WATCH WHAT I EAT
AND GO TO THE GYM

16:16.243 --> 16:18.611
AND BUY CREAMS AND DYES

16:18.611 --> 16:21.381
AND EXFOLIATE AND DERMABRATE
AND...

16:21.381 --> 16:24.584
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANY OF THAT STUFF FOR ME.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.885
YEAH, RIGHT.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.221
NO, ANGIE. I MEAN IT.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.690
EVERY TIME
I LOOK IN YOUR FACE,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.860
I STILL SEE THE GIRL
I MARRIED 20 YEARS AGO,

16:33.860 --> 16:37.030
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.731
REALLY?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.600
YES.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.575
I AM SO LUCKY I HAVE YOU
TO GROW OLD WITH.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.445
THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME LET GO.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.515
(sighs) AND IF NATURE
WANTS TO BLOW UP MY BODY

16:55.515 --> 16:57.917
LIKE AN OLD,
WRINKLED ELEPHANT,

16:57.917 --> 16:59.619
IT DOESN'T SCARE ME

16:59.619 --> 17:03.690
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL ALWAYS
SEE A 20-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.595
YEAH.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.233
(sighs)

17:13.233 --> 17:16.035
BENNY,
YOU TAKE US HOME.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.439
WAIT. A DOUGHNUT SHOP.

17:19.439 --> 17:24.077
PULL OVER. I HAVEN'T HAD
DOUGHNUTS IN YEARS.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.681
HEY.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.617
LOOK AT MY WATCH.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.521
THAT'S THE EXACT MOMENT
YOU SCREWED UP. (laughs)

17:50.537 --> 17:53.206
MAN, YOU'RE REALLY GETTING
IN BED FAST THESE DAYS,

17:53.206 --> 17:56.075
SKIPPING THE WHOLE
BEFORE-BED FACE ROUTINE.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.645
OH, YEAH.
WHO MISSES THAT?

17:58.645 --> 18:01.114
MMM. THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD.
YOU WANT ONE?

18:01.114 --> 18:04.884
DOUGHNUTS AND DOUGHNUT HOLES.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.255
YOU DON'T WANNA ACCIDENTALLY
GET A BITE OF AIR.

18:10.257 --> 18:14.227
CAN YOU TAKE THAT BOX
DOWNSTAIRS FOR ME?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.562
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.131
FACE CREAM, HAIR DYE,
WORKOUT CLOTHES--

18:18.131 --> 18:19.732
STUFF
I'M NOT GONNA USE ANYMORE.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.536
REALLY COMMITTED TO THIS WHOLE
LETTING GO THING, AREN'T YOU?

18:23.536 --> 18:26.273
GEORGE,
IT'S SO LIBERATING.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.409
I HAVEN'T EVEN WEIGHED MYSELF
IN THREE DAYS.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.945
BUT LIKE I SAID, I'LL ALWAYS
SEE THAT YOUNG GIRL I MARRIED

18:32.945 --> 18:34.481
IN THERE SOMEWHERE...

18:37.484 --> 18:41.288
(under breath) TRYING TO
BREATHE, CALLING FOR HELP.

18:45.192 --> 18:50.096
AH, THE LAST DOUGHNUT HOLE.

18:50.096 --> 18:53.933
OH, DON'T BE SAD.
YOU'LL SEE YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.203
HELLO.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.671
YOU KNOW, ANGIE,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.641
YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING
TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.810
YOU'RE SO NATURAL.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.478
OH.

19:05.478 --> 19:12.819
I'M ALWAYS GONNA LOVE
THOSE EYES...

19:12.819 --> 19:14.221
AND THAT NECK.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.127
I LOVE YOU.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.363
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.270
WHAT'S ON YOUR CHEEK?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.740
THIS IS MY AVOCADO MASK.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.908
IT MUST HAVE GOT ON MY HANDS
WHEN I WAS THROWING IT AWAY.

19:35.908 --> 19:40.813
YOU'RE TIRED. TAKE IT OFF
IN THE MORNING. GOOD NIGHT.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.749
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.184
YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT MY SKIN WRINKLING.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.654
NO. LOOK,
I WANT YOU TO RELAX

19:47.654 --> 19:49.756
AND NOT FREAK OUT
ABOUT YOUR LOOKS,

19:49.756 --> 19:52.759
BUT I WANT YOU TO LOOK HOT
WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT.

19:52.759 --> 19:57.129
YOU SAID YOU LOVE ME
FOR WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.931
YEAH, BUT Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

19:58.931 --> 20:02.469
ALL THAT'S INSIDE YOU RIGHT NOW
IS FRIED DOUGH AND SUGAR.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.573
COME ON, ANGIE.
THIS ISN'T JUST FOR ME.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.575
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.610
YOU'VE ALWAYS TAKEN PRIDE
IN HOW YOU LOOK.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.145
YEAH,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK

20:13.145 --> 20:15.047
TO OBSESSING
OVER MY APPEARANCE.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.451
LOOK, I'M NOT ASKING FOR THAT--
JUST A LITTLE MAINTENANCE.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.553
LOOK, MY TRUCK IS OLD,
BUT DO I GIVE UP? NO.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.555
I BUFF OUT THE SCRATCHES

20:22.555 --> 20:26.192
AND DO A PRESSURE WASH
ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE.

20:26.192 --> 20:32.899
WELL, I DO FEEL KIND OF LOUSY
AFTER EATING ALL THAT JUNK.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.635
MAYBE THERE IS SOME SORT
OF MIDDLE GROUND.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.004
WHY DON'T WE GO ON
A BRISK 20-MINUTE WALK,

20:38.004 --> 20:41.908
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
OVER OATMEAL?

20:41.908 --> 20:45.044
I COULD GO TO THE GYM
A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK,

20:45.044 --> 20:48.147
AND I DON'T NEED TO THROW OUT
ALL THESE FACE CREAMS.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.782
THERE YOU GO.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.984
AND I'LL KEEP DOING
WHAT I HAVE TO DO

20:51.984 --> 20:54.086
TO STAY BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.489
WHAT IS THAT, EXACTLY?

20:56.489 --> 21:01.628
THE ROOF, THE GRILL
AND THE BUMPER. WATCH OUT.

21:03.830 --> 21:08.635
WELL, WE BOTH
DO LOOK PRETTY GOOD.

21:08.635 --> 21:12.271
HOW LONG
YOU THINK WE GOT?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.542
I THINK WE GOT TEN YEARS
OF BEING "HOT,"

21:15.542 --> 21:18.044
20 YEARS OF BEING "NOT BAD,"
AND 5 YEARS OF

21:18.044 --> 21:20.913
"DID THAT SMELL
COME FROM ME OR YOU?"
