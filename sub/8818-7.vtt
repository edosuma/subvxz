WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.545
- The Academy is
counting on you.

00:03.628 --> 00:06.089
The whole Realm is
counting on you.

00:06.172 --> 00:10.343
If you'll excuse me,
I have an announcement to make.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.016
- Jessie!

00:17.100 --> 00:19.269
- Don't talk to me until
you get my powers back.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.270
- But I--
- Nope!

00:20.353 --> 00:21.604
- MALE VOICE:
Attention students.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.899
- Things have been a little
too lax around here lately:

00:24.983 --> 00:27.193
The ominous fog
in the gym.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.279
The mysterious boom
in the dorms.

00:29.362 --> 00:35.368
And my favorite shirt still
reeks of garlic mashed potatoes.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.621
So I've decided
to call in reinforcements.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.540
Meet your new coach...

00:40.623 --> 00:43.752
Miss Foiler.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.383
- Oh no.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.052
- Miss Foiler is here
not only to whip you all

00:53.136 --> 00:56.681
into shape, but to bring some
semblance of order back

00:56.765 --> 00:57.474
to the Academy!

00:57.557 --> 00:59.809
- What's wrong?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.770
- She's the Guardian
from my nightmare.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.813
- Hello, children, I look
forward to meeting you all

01:04.897 --> 01:06.065
in the gym tomorrow.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.152
- Come on, she doesn't look
that tough.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.157
- This is the sorriest bunch
of Guardian wanna-be's

01:14.240 --> 01:17.035
I have ever seen!
- [air horn blasting]

01:18.161 --> 01:19.704
- Don't let her
intimidate you.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.955
I know the type.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.583
The key is to be prepared
for anything she throws at you.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.170
- [air horn blasting]
- No talking!

01:27.253 --> 01:28.963
- Weren't ready
for an air horn, huh?

01:29.047 --> 01:30.715
- Totally not ready.
- Name?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.008
- Andi Cruz.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.677
- Transferred from Iridium High.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.806
So you went to school
with the Chosen One?

01:37.889 --> 01:40.558
- Oh, yeah,
Emma's my homegirl!

01:41.434 --> 01:44.020
- This is "my" home...

01:44.103 --> 01:45.438
girl.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.817
And in here, you're nothing
but a witch without powers.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.610
- Well, actually, I think
you might wanna look

01:50.693 --> 01:52.529
at your clipboard again--
see where it says "coven?"

01:52.612 --> 01:54.864
- You're human?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.867
- Miami born and raised!
Wha'zuuup!

01:58.868 --> 01:59.869
Yeah. I'm human.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.163
- There's never been
a human Guardian

02:02.247 --> 02:04.249
in the entire history
of the Realm.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.252
Humans aren't even supposed
to be in the Realm.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.255
What makes you think
that you can protect it?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.215
- I don't think
I can protect it.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.008
I know I can.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.720
And I'll do it all while being
Guardian to the Chosen One.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.390
- [air horn blasting]

02:20.473 --> 02:24.644
- So you think you're worthy
of being a Guardian?

02:26.312 --> 02:29.023
Well, Miami...

02:29.107 --> 02:31.860
you're gonna to have
to get through me first.

02:31.943 --> 02:32.902
Now...

02:32.986 --> 02:34.904
drop and gimme 50!

[laughing]

03:15.194 --> 03:18.615
This recruit thinks she's
a special clubber,

03:18.698 --> 03:20.867
make her arms turn to rubber!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.786
That's right,
you doe-eyed benchwarmers,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.580
this witch has got powers!

03:25.663 --> 03:28.082
Wha'zuuup!

03:28.166 --> 03:30.376
I chose to be a Guardian
because I thought

03:30.460 --> 03:33.171
it was the most honorable
position I could think of!

03:33.254 --> 03:36.591
Anyone born with powers
can be a witch.

03:36.674 --> 03:40.762
But it takes skill, strength,
and perseverance

03:40.845 --> 03:43.598
to be a Guardian.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.976
Your next challenge will test
those qualities,

03:47.060 --> 03:50.563
as you guide your WITs
through an obstacle course.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.232
Team with the best time gets
extra bonus points.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.986
Last team gets half
their points taken away.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.906
Training starts tomorrow!
- [air horn blasting]

04:00.823 --> 04:01.908
- I have a question...

04:01.991 --> 04:03.159
- The spell will wear off.

04:03.242 --> 04:06.245
Just try not to do
any heavy lifting.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.997
Your arms could stretch out.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.292
- No, no, I mean,
is that all you got?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.798
I can't feel my arms.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.262
Hey!

04:24.138 --> 04:26.224
- How's that going?
- Not well.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.101
And it's not gonna get
any better until I get Aggie

04:28.184 --> 04:29.519
to give her her powers back.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.270
- Didn't he promise to return
them if you fix

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
the big lift thingie
in the atrium?

04:32.438 --> 04:34.440
- Yeah, I can't do it
if I can't feel my hands.

04:34.524 --> 04:38.528
Oh! I think I'm getting some
feeling back in my left pinky.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.612
Well, that's a start.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.697
- Well that looks weird.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.949
- Yeah, you know,
I've always had weird pinkies.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.325
Nothing I can do about it.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.327
- No, I meant that.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.624
- Hey, Benny,
can I have a word?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.918
Okay, how do I put this
delicately?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.421
Oh, yeah... you look
completely ridiculous!

04:56.504 --> 04:59.257
- I look completely ridiculous?

04:59.340 --> 05:00.299
Wait, you don't like my outfit?

05:00.383 --> 05:04.554
- Well, for starters,
it's not your outfit.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.598
You look like Luke.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.226
- Hm, what do you know?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.061
Guess we have the same taste.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.313
How odd is that?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.649
- Very, very odd.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.778
What's really
going on, Ben?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.155
- I don't know.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.949
I thought
if I dressed like Luke,

05:25.033 --> 05:26.367
people would think
I was cool like Luke.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.119
- Why would you want
to be cool like Luke,

05:28.202 --> 05:30.997
when you can be cool
like Andi?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.958
- You want me
to dress like you?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.043
- No! No!

05:35.126 --> 05:36.919
I want you to dress like Ben.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.088
- But everybody ignores Ben.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.633
When Luke talks,
people listen.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.260
- But you gotta be you.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.887
And if you don't know
who that is, that's cool.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.264
Just try new things...

05:48.347 --> 05:49.348
find yourself.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.309
- Find myself, huh?

05:51.392 --> 05:54.270
You might be onto something.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.277
- Remember when the Captain
fought Professor Loco

06:01.360 --> 06:02.570
inside his lair?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.822
- And pulled out all those
ninja stars from his chest armor

06:04.906 --> 06:06.282
and: Tak! Tak!
Tak! Tak! Tak!

06:06.365 --> 06:08.993
Nailed Loco with his own
doomsday device.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.163
- Classic Captain!

06:12.246 --> 06:13.748
- Are you guys serious?

06:13.831 --> 06:15.333
- Totally!

06:15.416 --> 06:18.377
Loco's alien robot monkey freed
him before the thing blew up!

06:18.461 --> 06:19.378
But the explosion
sealed up the lair,

06:19.462 --> 06:23.299
trapping Loco
in his own weirdo world!

06:23.382 --> 06:26.177
- I feel like I'm trapped
in my own weirdo world.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.305
- Do you wanna play, too?

06:29.388 --> 06:31.307
- Don't forget, homework
tonight in the library.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.102
You need to brush up
on your Realm geography.

06:34.185 --> 06:34.977
- Come on.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.063
I'll even let you play
robot monkey.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.064
I'll even give you a tail.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.483
- How are you gonna do that?

06:40.566 --> 06:42.985
You don't have any powers.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.153
- And you still
look like a monkey!

06:44.237 --> 06:46.614
- Are you really gonna
let her talk to your sister

06:46.697 --> 06:47.573
like that?

06:47.657 --> 06:49.283
- The alien robot monkey
is super cool.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.035
That was a compliment.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.208
- How much longer?

06:57.291 --> 06:59.001
I'd like to give
Headmaster Agamemnon an ETA.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.212
- ANDI: FYI...

07:01.295 --> 07:02.380
IDK.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.215
Now, hand me a twelvepoint
flex-head with a five inch

07:04.298 --> 07:07.760
wobble extension, will you?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.513
It's in my toolbox.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.139
- Ouch!

07:11.222 --> 07:14.600
This toolbox just bit me!

07:14.684 --> 07:16.394
- Oh.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.604
Forgot to disarm the tool
thief protection.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.861
- You're dangerous,
Andrea Cruz.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.948
- Just let me work
my magic, okay?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.741
- What are you doing?

07:30.825 --> 07:31.868
- Trying to get
your powers back.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.578
- Yeah right.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.248
- I know what I'm doing, okay?

07:37.331 --> 07:39.000
I--ugh!

07:45.089 --> 07:47.341
- Why is this so hard?

07:47.425 --> 07:51.220
Okay.
Let's try that again.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.182
I cannot stand this heat,
pour me a lemonade

07:54.265 --> 07:54.807
and make it sweet!

07:54.891 --> 07:58.060
[gasping]

08:00.104 --> 08:02.523
[squealing]

08:02.607 --> 08:04.775
- A little too tart
for my liking.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.693
But not bad.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.362
So...

08:08.446 --> 08:09.155
What are you doing?

08:09.238 --> 08:10.781
Practicing your powers?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.909
- No!

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
I don't have any power,
I was just back here...

08:15.161 --> 08:19.040
looking for a flower!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.419
Oh.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.670
Ha-ha,

08:24.754 --> 08:26.047
very funny of you.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.465
- I didn't do that.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.883
You did.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.009
- Fine!

08:30.092 --> 08:31.010
My powers kicked in.

08:31.093 --> 08:33.095
What can I say?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.554
I'm a late bloomer, I guess.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.558
- A late bloomer
or a bad liar.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.601
I'm gonna tell everyone.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.520
- Calm down, Emily!

08:42.605 --> 08:42.897
Sheesh!

08:42.980 --> 08:44.857
[sighing]

08:44.941 --> 08:48.402
You know the Dyad Tree
in the atrium?

08:48.486 --> 08:53.115
Somehow the sap from its roots
gives you magical powers.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.409
- You discovered the sap?

08:55.493 --> 08:58.329
I mean, I read all about this
in a book of legends

08:58.412 --> 08:59.622
of the Realm...

08:59.705 --> 09:02.959
So that's what's in the hidden
room, the roots of the tree?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.377
- Yes.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.170
- And you don't know
how to get back in there

09:06.254 --> 09:07.630
without magic, do you?

09:07.713 --> 09:11.717
- No, but I have
a whole container full of--

09:11.801 --> 09:12.385
Wait...

09:12.468 --> 09:15.304
why are you so interested?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.305
- Oh!

09:16.389 --> 09:18.557
Just because--
maybe if you had more sap,

09:18.641 --> 09:20.810
I could help you
out with your magic.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.602
We could have so much fun.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.146
- You'd teach me
how to use it?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.982
- Of course.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.275
You're my Guardian.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.693
- Deal.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.820
But this stays
between me and you.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.989
No word to anyone,
not even your brother.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.033
- You bet.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.327
- Why do I get the feeling
that you failed

09:38.411 --> 09:40.496
at fixing the machine?

09:40.579 --> 09:43.708
- If by failed you mean
I fixed it, then, yeah,

09:43.791 --> 09:45.167
totally failed.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.379
- So you did
or did not fix it?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.965
- She's humming like
a three ton baby after a feeding

09:51.048 --> 09:53.426
of grade A Diesel.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.177
- [typing]

09:56.554 --> 09:58.347
Cameron!

09:58.431 --> 09:59.098
- Headmaster Agamemnon!

09:59.181 --> 10:00.516
I was just...

10:00.599 --> 10:03.227
making sure that the lift
was working.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.855
And I'm happy to say...

10:05.938 --> 10:07.606
that it is.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.610
- I must admit,
I am impressed.

10:11.694 --> 10:15.031
If only you could apply yourself
to your training

10:15.114 --> 10:16.073
in the same way.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.701
I have yet to see you
at the top of the Board,

10:18.784 --> 10:19.744
Miss Cruz.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.996
Frankly, I was expecting
more from you.

10:22.079 --> 10:22.872
- It's my strategy.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.373
I like to hold back
and then boom!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.709
Race past the competition.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.337
Full throttle!

10:29.420 --> 10:30.379
Now.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.590
I believe we had a deal?

10:33.841 --> 10:36.761
- Dude, how have I never
thought of using magic

10:36.844 --> 10:38.512
to make costumes?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.431
- I don't know,
but these are pretty sweet.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.601
- Next time I'll be
Captain El Capitan

10:43.684 --> 10:45.478
and you play Professor Loco.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.813
- Be careful what you wish for
El Capitan.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.940
For I will destroy you!

10:50.024 --> 10:51.692
- You're so much more fun
than my sister.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.571
- These two think
they make a good team,

10:55.654 --> 10:58.282
sticky strings will
make them scream!

11:04.372 --> 11:05.748
- That...

11:05.831 --> 11:06.248
was...

11:06.332 --> 11:09.502
- BOTH: Awesome!

11:09.585 --> 11:10.586
- What?

11:10.669 --> 11:12.713
No, that wasn't awesome.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.174
It was very un-awesome.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.262
You think that's funny,
try this on for size,

11:20.346 --> 11:23.182
make the fountain
spit a muddy surprise!

11:31.023 --> 11:33.651
Oh, no, did Captain El Capitan

11:33.734 --> 11:35.945
and Master Loco get attacked

11:36.028 --> 11:36.946
by alien fungus water?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.407
- Come on.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.784
It's Professor Loco.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.702
- It's a comic book
and it's dumb!

11:44.912 --> 11:49.708
- Man, that water fountain
needs to be fixed.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.670
- Ethan,
your evil sister did this!

11:52.753 --> 11:54.672
- Oh...

11:54.755 --> 11:57.007
I guess she can be fun!

12:02.221 --> 12:03.180
- What do you want?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.807
- What happened to you?

12:06.267 --> 12:07.977
- Emily happened.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.020
- Like Guardian like WIT,
I guess.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.439
- Anything else?

12:11.522 --> 12:14.233
- Oh, nothing, just wanted
to stop by, say what up...

12:14.316 --> 12:15.484
see if you wanted
your powers back.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.196
- I told you, don't talk to
me until you get my powers back!

12:19.280 --> 12:22.074
Wait...

12:22.158 --> 12:23.826
You're kidding me?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.162
- Hey, who's the best Guardian?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.706
No, seriously.
I wanna hear you say it.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.125
- You're the best Guardian.

12:37.756 --> 12:38.549
It worked!

12:38.632 --> 12:40.009
I can't believe
you got them back.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.678
- Hey, a promise is
a promise.

12:43.679 --> 12:47.183
- Andi...thanks.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.146
- BOTH: You just go...

13:00.821 --> 13:02.031
- Payback time.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.954
- Emily is cozy
and ready to dream,

13:09.038 --> 13:11.290
fill her bed with sticky cream.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.253
- Ewwww!

13:19.381 --> 13:22.760
Big mistake, Novoa!

13:27.097 --> 13:28.474
- What's Andi doing here
already?

13:28.557 --> 13:30.226
- Foiler's been
drilling her all night.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.228
- She doesn't back down,
does she?

13:32.311 --> 13:33.646
- Nope.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.606
Backing down is definitely not
in her toolbox.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.399
- That's pretty cool.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.944
- Today you'll get
a little taste of what's to come

13:40.027 --> 13:42.196
in the final!

13:42.279 --> 13:44.740
I will not only test you on
your physical strength...

13:44.823 --> 13:47.451
...but also on
your mental fortitude.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.912
And above all...

13:49.995 --> 13:52.498
I will test you on your
determination to become

13:52.581 --> 13:53.666
a Guardian!

13:53.749 --> 13:57.002
You think
you're Guardian material?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.462
Prove it!

13:58.546 --> 14:00.297
Miami, you're up first.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.841
- [air horn blasting]

14:02.925 --> 14:04.677
- Go, go, go!

14:04.760 --> 14:07.096
Imagine you're
being chased by witch hunters!

14:07.179 --> 14:13.269
- ♪

14:19.984 --> 14:21.777
- Your witch
tele-transports away,

14:21.860 --> 14:23.612
and now you're on your own.

14:23.696 --> 14:29.785
- ♪

14:35.541 --> 14:37.626
- The only way to survive...

14:37.710 --> 14:39.295
is to be prepared
for anything.

14:39.378 --> 14:46.176
- ♪

14:52.141 --> 14:58.188
♪

15:06.071 --> 15:06.864

15:06.947 --> 15:08.991

transported back

15:09.074 --> 15:10.576
to the gym!

15:12.494 --> 15:13.662
Not you.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.582
You've just earned yourself

15:16.665 --> 15:19.335
another go at
the obstacle course, Preppy.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.836
- Hey...

15:20.919 --> 15:23.047
that's what I call him.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.467
- I am detecting
a faint residue of magic,

15:26.550 --> 15:29.762
less than 500 Mandilars.

15:29.845 --> 15:30.512
- Are Mandilars the ones
that look like

15:30.596 --> 15:33.349
tiny little cherry-apples?

15:33.432 --> 15:34.975
Sorry, sir.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.645
- It appears that someone used
a spell within

15:37.728 --> 15:39.521
the treproximity of the tree

15:39.605 --> 15:41.523
and it was absorbed
by the foliage.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.025
- Do you want me to set
up security cameras?

15:43.108 --> 15:43.525
Motion detectors?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.486
Laser trip wires?

15:45.569 --> 15:47.863
- That won't be necessary.

15:47.946 --> 15:51.700
But it could explain
why the tree lost

15:51.784 --> 15:53.494
some of its leaves.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.373
We need to inform all
Guardians to keep a better eye

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
on their WITs.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.544
The Dyad Tree creates a direct
link between the human world

16:02.628 --> 16:03.587
and the Magic Realm.

16:03.671 --> 16:07.800
It must not be harmed
under any circumstance.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.885
- Why, what could happen, sir?

16:09.968 --> 16:12.554
- The repercussions of
the tree falling ill is ancient,

16:12.638 --> 16:14.973
secret knowledge...

16:15.057 --> 16:17.810
that not even I am privy to.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.270
Suffice it to say,
it would be bad.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.689
Very bad.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.981
See to it

16:23.065 --> 16:26.026
that the "no magic
in the atrium" rule is

16:26.110 --> 16:27.569
strictly enforced.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.739
- You can count on me, sir.

16:35.744 --> 16:37.329
- Benny?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.164
- What's up, Cruzer?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.333
- You look like you're about
to go on tour.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.461
- Oh, yeah, it's the new
radical me.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.714
You like it?

16:46.797 --> 16:47.506
- Do "you" like it?

16:47.589 --> 16:49.591
- I don't know.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.260
I'm trying what you said.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.428
You know, find myself.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.723
- Ben, that person should be
someone you want to be.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.933
Not who you think
others want you to be.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.477
Also I'm pretty sure no one
wants you to be leather dude

17:00.561 --> 17:02.771
with fake tattoos.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
These are fake tattoos, right?

17:05.065 --> 17:08.277
- I kinda used
a rock star spell.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.444
- You can't solve
everything with magic.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.030
Just be yourself.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.742
That way, when people like you,
they like the real you.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.617
- What if they don't like
the real me?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.579
- Then it's their loss.

17:22.583 --> 17:26.252
- The new me is no more,
make me look like I was before!

17:28.380 --> 17:31.425
Better?

17:31.508 --> 17:34.094
- Much better.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.145
- Hey, was that Ben?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.481
What happened to that snazzy
new look he was rockin'?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.357
- You mean "your" look?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.109
He came to his senses.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.820
Hey, listen.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.739
Thank you for helping
me out there.

17:53.822 --> 17:54.448
Not that I needed it.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.492
But still...

17:56.575 --> 17:58.243
it was pretty cool.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.037
- Well, you're pretty cool...

18:00.120 --> 18:02.915
I mean, like the way you
handled yourself with Foiler.

18:02.998 --> 18:03.916
I was impressed.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.586
- Nah, Coach
Foiler's a big softie.

18:07.669 --> 18:11.089
- Hey, why don't we train
for the fitness final together?

18:11.173 --> 18:14.092
You know, I could use
a sparring partner!

18:14.176 --> 18:16.970
- You want to train with me?
- You're right.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.514
You probably couldn't
keep up anyway.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.349
- Forget I said anything.
- Wait, hang on there!

18:20.432 --> 18:21.934
Academy gate, five o'clock.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.310
Bring two towels.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.520
One for your sweat.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.646
And one for your tears.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.523
- Oh, it's on!

18:30.943 --> 18:31.944
- Wow!

18:32.027 --> 18:34.321
Your roommate is really messy.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.365
- I don't have a roommate.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.533
- Wow!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.035
You're really messy.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.370
- My magic isn't very refined...

18:41.453 --> 18:44.039
yet.

18:44.122 --> 18:47.125
- I see, we have
our work cut out for us.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.253
Let's get you charged up
and get started!

18:49.336 --> 18:51.713
Where's that container
you mentioned with the tree sap?

18:51.797 --> 18:54.424
- No need.
I just recharged.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.635
- As your Magic Coach,
I should see how you get

18:56.718 --> 18:58.053
your powers...

18:58.136 --> 19:00.180
So where is it?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.558
Let's start with your
Signature Move then.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.102
- Oh, I already worked on it.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.481
- Good!

19:09.565 --> 19:12.901
Now close your eyes and think
really hard about what you want.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.571
But make sure it rhymes.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.242
- My table is
still out of whack,

19:20.325 --> 19:22.160
take this chair
and turn it back!

19:23.871 --> 19:25.289
I said "back"
not "bag!"

19:28.333 --> 19:31.086
- BOTH: [screaming]

19:34.548 --> 19:35.424
- What do we do?

19:35.507 --> 19:36.842
- You need to rhyme a spell!

19:36.925 --> 19:38.510
- I can't! I'm out of juice!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.429
You have to make
this monster go away!

19:40.512 --> 19:41.597
- No! I can't!

19:41.680 --> 19:43.056
It has to be "your" magic!

19:43.140 --> 19:44.433
- What? Why?

19:44.516 --> 19:46.393
- Or something really bad
could happen!

19:46.476 --> 19:48.312
- Something really bad
"is" happening!

19:48.395 --> 19:50.689
- Ruby, where do you keep
your tree sap?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.026
Come on!

20:05.162 --> 20:06.997
- This snake is
angry and grotesque,

20:07.080 --> 20:09.124
turn it back into my desk!

20:14.046 --> 20:17.215
I was thinking
of redecorating anyway.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
- Ruby...

20:19.384 --> 20:21.303
You did it!

20:21.386 --> 20:22.804
- Wait!

20:22.888 --> 20:25.223
I did, didn't I?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.987
- Hey, you ever try Tai Chi?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.782
- Oh, sure!
Just not my thing.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.867
Too spicy for my taste.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.411
- Come on, I'll show you.

20:52.960 --> 20:58.173
- So, why are you helping me?

20:58.256 --> 21:00.300
- Really?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.177
So I don't have
to hear you whine about

21:02.260 --> 21:04.054
how I only made top
on the Board, again,

21:04.137 --> 21:06.473
because Foiler has
it in for you.

21:06.556 --> 21:11.853
- But, we both want to be
Guardians to the Chosen One.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.273
- Nothing has changed.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.025
But I want to win fair
and square.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.860
Not because my opponent was
at a disadvantage.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.030
- How noble of you.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.282
- Honesty and fair play are
big in my family.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.871
My Uncle Leo used to say:

21:29.955 --> 21:33.500
"A win without honor...

21:33.583 --> 21:35.460
is a loss."

21:36.586 --> 21:37.796
Wait.
What time is it?

21:37.879 --> 21:40.007
- Almost 6:00.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.383
- The Academy closes at 6:00!

21:41.466 --> 21:43.343
We're gonna miss curfew!

21:50.892 --> 21:52.561
- Oh, no!

21:52.644 --> 21:53.854
We're late.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.773
- We're in so much trouble!

21:59.359 --> 22:14.416
- ♪
