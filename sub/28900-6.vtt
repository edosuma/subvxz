00:14.125 --> 00:16.837
Guys, we could actually win
Radio Eclipse live.

00:16.925 --> 00:19.618
I know. And look at
all these comments, too.

00:19.706 --> 00:21.542
"The Chi-Lective, yes, please!"

00:21.675 --> 00:24.448
- "Obsessed with Tess."
- What can I say?

00:24.690 --> 00:27.258
"I wanna be Nia
when I grow up." Aw!

00:27.346 --> 00:30.688
- Let me see what they say about me.
- Okay. All right.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.298
Let me see.

00:32.511 --> 00:35.085
"Booker's fine,
I guess."

00:37.401 --> 00:40.573
- Well, I guess I am fine.
- Yes!

00:40.878 --> 00:43.368
You guys know the other
hip-hop group at school?

00:43.455 --> 00:47.478
The 3Go's?
Quatro, Pump-Fake, and Lil Lo-Lo.

00:47.565 --> 00:50.102
Man, they think
they've got so much swag,

00:50.197 --> 00:52.742
but they're just
tryin' to be like me.

00:54.018 --> 00:56.589
I mean, like The Chi-Lective!

00:57.136 --> 00:58.988
Well, apparently,
they just released

00:59.075 --> 01:00.558
a diss track
about our video.

01:00.714 --> 01:03.532
What? Wait,
they're always super nice to me.

01:03.620 --> 01:05.870
Especially on test days.

01:07.339 --> 01:10.300
Oh, they're copying off of me.

01:10.409 --> 01:12.138
- Yeah, duh!
- Duh!

01:12.589 --> 01:15.235
Yeah, and that Lil Lo-Lo
is in Levi's homeroom,

01:15.323 --> 01:17.165
and he is always
smiling at me.

01:17.253 --> 01:19.839
I'm like, bruh,
what are you cheesing at?

01:19.956 --> 01:22.415
If their lyrics are as bad
as their jump-shots,

01:22.503 --> 01:24.274
believe me,
we've got nothing to worry about.

01:24.362 --> 01:26.918
Uh, your jump-shot's not...

01:27.005 --> 01:29.315
It's not about me
right now, Tess.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.768
Actually, Booker,
it is all about you.

01:32.856 --> 01:35.735
They're not dissing The Chi-Lective,
they're only dissing you.

01:35.823 --> 01:37.457
What? Me?

01:37.545 --> 01:40.928

03:10.605 --> 03:13.688
They roasted me at school
about sleeping in a bunk bed!

03:13.775 --> 03:15.288
It's bad for my rep!

03:15.375 --> 03:17.558
Why do you let the 3Go's
get under your skin?

03:17.645 --> 03:19.220
And at least they didn't
call you out

03:19.308 --> 03:21.885
for sleeping in Mom and Aunt
Chelsea's room when there's thunder.

03:22.485 --> 03:24.598
Okay, first off,

03:24.925 --> 03:27.638
I do that to protect Mom.

03:28.245 --> 03:30.245
And second of all,

03:30.333 --> 03:32.220
nobody protects me
from the disses I get.

03:32.308 --> 03:34.111
Well, somebody's gonna
need to protect you from me,

03:34.198 --> 03:36.347
unless y'all get to school
on time. Let's go.

03:36.511 --> 03:37.925
No, no, no. 
It's all the same.

03:38.013 --> 03:39.208
Y'all all go to
the same school,

03:39.295 --> 03:40.574
everybody got peanut
butter and jelly. Go!

03:40.661 --> 03:42.144
All right!

03:42.232 --> 03:43.387
I love you!

03:43.475 --> 03:44.855
I love you guys.

03:45.715 --> 03:46.658
Ooh!

03:46.745 --> 03:49.588
Are we talking about
a room remodel?

03:49.675 --> 03:51.572
Well, count me in!
Sign me up.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.488
You know,
and throw my hat into the...

03:54.045 --> 03:55.394
You know what I'm saying.

03:56.058 --> 03:57.767
No, Chelsea.
Actually, I can't hear you

03:57.855 --> 03:59.853
over the sound of my credit card
being declined.

03:59.941 --> 04:03.638
Right? Hey, how about
we just do it cute and cheap?

04:03.918 --> 04:05.295
I was married to that once.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.931
Come on. Let's go to the store.
Let's do it.

04:09.019 --> 04:11.099
- All right!
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?

04:11.230 --> 04:12.848
No, I mean...

04:13.043 --> 04:15.688
It's no big deal.
I can... let it go.

04:16.355 --> 04:18.488
I don't want to bother you
or anything, you know?

04:18.714 --> 04:22.746
- Well, I mean, I guess...
- Yes, yes! Do it! Yeah!

04:26.847 --> 04:28.080
Let it go, Booker.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.428
The 3Go's are just stunting

04:29.515 --> 04:31.566
to get more attention
for the video competition.

04:31.691 --> 04:34.386
And if anyone should be mad,
it ought to be me.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.035
Stealing my beats.

04:36.168 --> 04:39.377
Booker, it's clearly
just a sign of our success.

04:39.465 --> 04:41.991
Okay? Just focus on doing you,
and being positive.

04:42.078 --> 04:44.050
That's what The
Chi-Lective is about.

04:44.178 --> 04:45.677
Empowerment.

04:51.956 --> 04:55.730
What? I got memed,
and they gave me a pacifier?

04:55.862 --> 04:57.675
This is killing my rep!

04:57.965 --> 05:01.730
Twin, chill, okay?
It's just a dumb meme.

05:06.468 --> 05:09.581
Man, look at 'em.
They think they're swaggy

05:09.668 --> 05:13.551
with their jackets and their indoor
sunglasses and their theme song.

05:14.035 --> 05:16.199
Nah, Booker.
I think that's all in your head.

05:20.323 --> 05:21.336
Yo.

05:21.605 --> 05:23.301
Why'd you guys
diss me like that?

05:23.388 --> 05:24.511
I thought we were cool.

05:24.599 --> 05:26.012
You don't recall
hitting Quatro

05:26.118 --> 05:28.472
- with that cheap shot during dodgeball?
- Um-hmm.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.310
Quatro, there's two key elements
to dodgeball.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.832
Dodge, and ball.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.782
Now, you didn't do the first,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.648
so you got a face
full of the second.

05:38.736 --> 05:40.832
Plus, that was like,
forever ago.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.574
It was last week!

05:45.008 --> 05:47.027
You humiliated Quatro.

05:47.284 --> 05:49.886
- And Quatro never forgets.
- Nope.

05:50.153 --> 05:52.988
Yeah! Pump-Fake!

05:55.178 --> 05:57.480
By the way,
you're looking radiant today.

05:57.821 --> 05:59.527
My queen.

06:01.524 --> 06:04.002
I ain't your queen, bruh.

you're gonna love this design.

06:19.938 --> 06:23.308
I call it, um,
"pubescent chic."

06:24.748 --> 06:27.578
Don't worry, Chels. I got this handled.
I got this handled.

06:30.337 --> 06:34.167
What is this
egregious monstrosity?

06:35.558 --> 06:38.528
I've been hitting the dictionary
pretty hard lately.

06:39.306 --> 06:41.290
Well, this is the boy's
new look.

06:41.378 --> 06:45.908
It's a desk, a chair,
and a dresser, all for 99 bucks!

06:46.572 --> 06:49.322
I call it "clearance chic."

06:50.009 --> 06:52.603
I... I thought we were gonna
do this together, you know?

06:52.691 --> 06:55.314
No, no, no. No need.
No, it's already designed,

06:55.402 --> 06:57.759
We can put it together...

06:58.315 --> 06:59.815
together.

07:00.718 --> 07:02.031
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:02.118 --> 07:03.940
We can do it together.
Why don't you grab the end of this box?

We gotta hit 'em hard,

08:06.830 --> 08:09.589
knock 'em down

08:13.018 --> 08:15.128

09:46.187 --> 09:47.787
I love you, Raven.

09:53.311 --> 09:54.611
See, it... Oh!

09:57.881 --> 09:58.881
See...

10:01.381 --> 10:04.121
Fifty-one more pieces to go!

10:07.521 --> 10:09.321
Eh? Eh?

10:12.391 --> 10:14.104
Hand me the
<i>flugenflork.</i>

10:14.385 --> 10:18.014
Rae, if you're gonna do panel G,
you don't need the <i> flugenflork.</i>

10:18.455 --> 10:21.344
You need the, uh,
<i>flaugenborgen.</i> Yeah.

10:21.431 --> 10:23.614
See? It's right here.

10:23.701 --> 10:24.914
What did you do, Chelsea?

10:25.001 --> 10:28.184
Oh, I... I just wanted to give
the instructions some life.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.671
You haven't been listening
to me this whole time,

10:30.759 --> 10:33.428
so I... I thought
I'd give these guys a story.

10:33.516 --> 10:34.616
See?

10:35.548 --> 10:37.781
Oh, I see, I see.

10:37.869 --> 10:40.931
"Young Bjorn has spent
his whole life

10:41.056 --> 10:44.976

in that story.

be like this?

Yeah, I mean, like, look at this.
Look at this.

12:49.078 --> 12:51.205
Booker, that was a punk move.

12:51.293 --> 12:52.315
- Real talk.
- Yeah.

12:52.403 --> 12:53.924
Okay, well, real, real talk?

- Put it down?
- Yes.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.106
Look, Booker, I'm not gonna put The
Chi-Lective's business out on the street.

13:12.194 --> 13:14.145
But we're gonna talk
about this when we get home.

13:16.918 --> 13:19.082

freestyle battle me right now.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.260
Quatro even writes

but I discipline my son.

15:11.066 --> 15:12.066

You are badly behaved.

15:14.764 --> 15:17.107
But Mom,
they attacked me first!

and bad energy.
That's not what we're about.

17:35.326 --> 17:37.394
Yeah. Even though
your word play was on point,

17:37.482 --> 17:39.294

Hey, you guys.
I just wanted to let you know that

18:54.974 --> 18:57.425
I baked some cookies!
They're amazing!

18:57.513 --> 19:00.204
Oh, snap. I forgot.
You're grounded from cookies.

19:01.146 --> 19:03.818
- That's cold-blooded, Mom.
- Right?

19:05.761 --> 19:07.575
So, why aren't you practicing

19:07.662 --> 19:08.844

19:08.931 --> 19:11.308
- Solo, huh?
- Yeah.

19:11.396 --> 19:12.784
I quit.

19:12.871 --> 19:16.029
I mean, I defended myself,
and they didn't back me up.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.513
Defended yourself
from what, Booker?

19:18.716 --> 19:21.740
You acted out of character,
and you dissed your family, too.

19:21.888 --> 19:25.357
Most importantly,
my baba ghanoush.

19:26.881 --> 19:30.951
I know, Mama. I was just so
focused on defending my rep.

19:32.052 --> 19:33.464
I guess I got carried away.

19:33.716 --> 19:36.534
Well, I am sorry that they
hurt your feelings, Booker.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.927
But when you focus so much on
what you want to do, and stop

19:40.060 --> 19:42.716
listening to the people
who love you, that's when...

19:43.232 --> 19:44.988
teamwork just crumbles.

19:45.076 --> 19:49.669
This room is fantastic.
It really is.

19:54.161 --> 19:55.990
You're just like your mother,
aren't you.

19:56.302 --> 19:57.394
What do you mean, Mom?

19:57.638 --> 20:00.241
I just need to listen
to Chelsea more, that's all.

20:01.311 --> 20:04.552
Well, since we're both
so much alike,

20:04.701 --> 20:05.895
can we at least
split the cookie?

20:05.982 --> 20:07.731
No, you can't have the cookie.
You can't have the cookie.

20:07.818 --> 20:09.721
- Can't have the cookie!
- Aah!

20:15.361 --> 20:17.909
Okay, five, six, seven, eight.

20:18.027 --> 20:20.084
And then you rap.
And then you rap.

20:20.292 --> 20:22.439
And then I sing,

20:22.527 --> 20:24.454
and then we dance.
And then we dance.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.124
And you rap, and you rap,
and you rap, and you rap,

20:27.245 --> 20:29.783
- and you rap, and you rap...
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

20:29.870 --> 20:31.293
- And you rap... You like the choreography?
- Nia! Nia!

20:31.380 --> 20:33.627
Don't you think we should
finish writing the song, though,

20:33.714 --> 20:35.290
before we choreograph it?

20:35.378 --> 20:37.040
- 'Cause I don't just wanna dance,
- Oh.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.680
- Dance, dance, dance, dance.
- Okay.

20:38.816 --> 20:41.521
All right, I... I get it. I thought
it was good, but...

20:42.775 --> 20:44.204
Troof on the Roof?

20:44.837 --> 20:46.274
On our rooftop?

20:46.750 --> 20:47.882
Are you kidding me?

20:47.970 --> 20:49.680
Booker even put The
Chi-Lective's name on it!

20:49.767 --> 20:51.274
Uh, and according to this flyer,

20:51.376 --> 20:53.155
Troof on the Roof
starts in like 10 minutes.

20:53.298 --> 20:55.376
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We'd better get up there.

21:04.385 --> 21:06.806
Chels, I'm sorry for not
listening to you earlier.

21:07.111 --> 21:09.283
We make a great team
and I have to remember that.

21:09.371 --> 21:11.134
Aw, Rae!

21:11.669 --> 21:15.705
