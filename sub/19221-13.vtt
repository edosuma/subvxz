WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:03.852
Good morning! Who
wants pie? Maya, Randy?

00:03.859 --> 00:06.193
Guy with a serious face
but a whimsical scarf?

00:07.329 --> 00:09.741
Why are you coming to
a donut shop with pie?

00:09.747 --> 00:10.325
It's 8:00 a.m.

00:10.365 --> 00:12.531
What, can't a guy treat himself
to a little breakfast pie?

00:12.533 --> 00:14.834
- Nadine broke up with him.
- Oh, no.

00:14.836 --> 00:16.335
What happened?

00:16.337 --> 00:17.637
No idea. She just called me up

00:17.639 --> 00:19.305
after two months of
dating and said it's over.

00:19.307 --> 00:20.439
But it's cool.

00:20.441 --> 00:22.241
It's not cool. He's devastated.

00:22.243 --> 00:23.542
Not devastated.

00:23.544 --> 00:25.177
Fine. Despondent.

00:25.179 --> 00:27.179
I... I'm not despondent.

00:27.181 --> 00:28.948
I mean, yeah, sure, I
just finished a painting

00:28.950 --> 00:30.349
of our bodies merged together forever,

00:30.351 --> 00:33.052
but I'll just set it on fire.

00:33.054 --> 00:35.388
Just like Nadine did
to his heart. Cherry?

00:35.390 --> 00:36.756
Please.

00:36.758 --> 00:39.225
So meet my new girlfriend, pie.

00:39.227 --> 00:41.394
You ain't never gonna leave me.

00:42.597 --> 00:44.664
I know I should feel sad for him.

00:44.666 --> 00:47.500
But now there's gonna be
more Franco-Sweatpants time.

00:47.502 --> 00:50.670
We can finally take that trip
up to Michigan wine country.

00:50.672 --> 00:52.738
Will you guys watch my laptop?

00:52.740 --> 00:53.873
I have to feed the meter.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.775
My dad says if I get
one more parking ticket

00:55.777 --> 00:57.476
he's gonna stop making my car payments,

00:57.478 --> 00:59.912
and this is not the relatable
problem I thought it was

00:59.914 --> 01:01.347
when I started talking.

01:02.884 --> 01:05.618
So if somebody comes in and
grabs her laptop and runs,

01:05.620 --> 01:07.420
we're supposed to chase 'em?

01:07.422 --> 01:09.188
Yeah, we hang out in a donut shop.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.814
What kind of shape does
she think we're in?

01:10.946 --> 01:11.946
Yeah.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.493
Maya's always banging away

01:14.495 --> 01:16.595
on that dissertation.

01:16.597 --> 01:18.039
Wonder what it's about?

01:18.086 --> 01:21.867
Probably boring young girl stuff
nobody cares about.

01:21.869 --> 01:23.269
Hey, our names are in here.

01:23.271 --> 01:25.805
Let me see, let me see, let me see.

01:25.807 --> 01:28.774
This whole thing's about us.

01:28.776 --> 01:32.311
Superior Donuts, A Case Study
on the Effects of Gentrification

01:32.313 --> 01:34.547
on Interclass Social Bonding.

01:34.549 --> 01:35.848
So all the time she's
been hanging out here,

01:35.850 --> 01:37.049
she's been writing about us?

01:37.051 --> 01:38.184
Hey, come on, what are you doing?

01:38.186 --> 01:39.251
You're not supposed to be reading that.

01:39.253 --> 01:40.453
Oh, yeah, that's an invasion

01:40.455 --> 01:42.555
- of her privacy.
- According to this,

01:42.557 --> 01:45.758
she's been invading
our privacy all year.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.760
Fawz, you're in here.

01:47.762 --> 01:51.697
Fawz Al-Shahrani is a
ruthless businessman...

01:51.699 --> 01:53.866
She gets me.

01:55.412 --> 01:58.037
... who is so devoid of
compassion and humanity

01:58.039 --> 02:01.374
he's incapable of forming
meaningful friendships.

02:01.376 --> 02:03.876
That's a little strong.

02:03.878 --> 02:05.344
Right?

02:05.346 --> 02:06.679
Hello?

02:06.681 --> 02:08.180
Anyone?

02:09.650 --> 02:10.750
All right, here's me.

02:10.752 --> 02:13.219
Carl Tushinski is a disenfranchised

02:13.221 --> 02:15.921
middle-aged male, unable
to get a full-time job,

02:15.923 --> 02:19.225
cast adrift in a world
that's passed him by.

02:21.396 --> 02:25.564
I got lost in the words,
but her tone seems hurtful.

02:26.801 --> 02:29.168
Look, I know it's cool
to learn what a schoolgirl

02:29.170 --> 02:31.670
with no life experience
thinks about you,

02:31.672 --> 02:33.706
but just walk away.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.442
Randy, she calls you

02:36.444 --> 02:38.344
warm and nurturing, the bridge

02:38.346 --> 02:40.946
that connects the
inhabitants of the shop.

02:40.948 --> 02:42.481
That's so sweet!

02:42.483 --> 02:44.550
Scooch over.

02:44.552 --> 02:46.585
You sure she doesn't say
Sweatpants is the bridge?

02:46.587 --> 02:48.721
She doesn't mention my
name in there anywhere.

02:48.723 --> 02:52.525
And I've been through so much,
with the... the... blonde girl.

02:52.527 --> 02:54.927
- Here comes Maya.
- Maya!

02:56.497 --> 02:57.830
All right, if anybody wants

02:57.832 --> 02:59.999
some pie, I left it in the
kitchen. I've had enough.

03:00.001 --> 03:01.801
Just like Nadine had enough of me.

03:01.803 --> 03:03.469
Maybe she'd like me more if I was a pie.

03:03.471 --> 03:06.972
That's impossible, you're
not a pie. You a man.

03:06.974 --> 03:09.041
How do you know you're
having a breakdown, you know?

03:09.043 --> 03:11.477
I'm gonna have some more pie.

03:18.553 --> 03:20.786
I can't believe Maya
didn't me put in her paper.

03:20.788 --> 03:22.822
I got to get another
look at that computer.

03:22.824 --> 03:24.723
I told you last night, let it go.

03:24.725 --> 03:27.460
Maybe I should hack her mainframe.

03:27.462 --> 03:28.994
Only problem is

03:28.996 --> 03:31.964
I don't know how to hack.

03:31.966 --> 03:34.934
And I'm not sure what a mainframe is.

03:34.936 --> 03:37.036
Why do you care what Maya thinks?

03:37.038 --> 03:38.637
Because she's just so judgey.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.502
Like a pecker bird who
just peck, peck, peck, peck,

03:40.508 --> 03:42.241
- peck, peck, peck, peck.
- Uh, thank you, thank you.

03:42.243 --> 03:43.876
I know what a pecker is.

03:43.878 --> 03:45.311
Uh, pecking birds.

03:45.313 --> 03:46.479
Uh, woodpeck...

03:48.249 --> 03:50.249
She doesn't know me.
I'm perfectly capable

03:50.251 --> 03:51.951
of being friends with someone.

03:51.953 --> 03:53.953
Hey, Sweatypants, where you from?

03:53.955 --> 03:55.721
Um, you know, actually, I was
born in Maryland, and I was...

03:55.723 --> 03:57.823
See? Friends.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.826
And I can totally hold
down a regular job.

04:00.828 --> 04:02.528
That's why I got the want ads.

04:02.530 --> 04:05.998
I'm just gonna circle anything
that's promising, and I'm done.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.267
What happened to the want ads?

04:08.269 --> 04:10.970
The Internet. But you know
what, I can set you up a profile

04:10.972 --> 04:12.638
on one of those job search Web sites.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.441
And while I'm at it, I'll just
swing by Nadine's Facebook page

04:15.443 --> 04:16.709
and see what she's up to.

04:16.711 --> 04:19.945
Oh, look, the bitch is having sushi.

04:19.947 --> 04:21.579
Hi, guys.

04:21.582 --> 04:22.948
Morning, Maya.

04:22.950 --> 04:24.550
Here, have a donut.

04:24.552 --> 04:26.752
I only had one bite.

04:28.322 --> 04:30.456
Listen, Arthur said he's
gonna turn off the water later,

04:30.458 --> 04:32.591
so if you got to go to the bathroom,

04:32.593 --> 04:34.059
you should go now.

04:35.596 --> 04:38.497
I'm... I'm-I'm good, but thanks.

04:38.499 --> 04:40.699
Suit yourself.

04:46.173 --> 04:48.641
You know what, better safe than sorry.

04:48.643 --> 04:50.776
- Good thinking.
- Brilliant.

04:50.778 --> 04:53.546
Okay, find Sweatpants.

04:53.548 --> 04:55.247
Nothing.

04:55.249 --> 04:57.750
Maybe she spelled
Sweatpants with two words.

04:57.752 --> 04:59.885
A lot of my mail comes that way.

04:59.887 --> 05:01.387
Hey, hey!

05:01.389 --> 05:03.355
What did I tell you?
Get away from there.

05:03.357 --> 05:06.158
That's easy for you to say,
you're all over this thing.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.561
A curmudgeonly father figure. A widower.

05:08.563 --> 05:10.095
He once told me that every Sunday

05:10.097 --> 05:11.897
he takes flowers to
his late wife's grave.

05:11.899 --> 05:14.466
Oh! You are so lucky.

05:14.468 --> 05:16.468
I didn't know that.

05:16.470 --> 05:18.270
Well, now you do.

05:18.272 --> 05:19.939
Well, is that where you
rush off to every Sunday?

05:19.941 --> 05:21.273
What's with the third degree?

05:21.275 --> 05:23.642
You know, some things are private, okay?

05:25.646 --> 05:28.093
Oh, God, are you still doing this?

05:28.148 --> 05:29.187
You know, there's a lot of stuff

05:29.226 --> 05:29.982
in that computer I never heard.

05:29.984 --> 05:31.383
You know, like, did you know Arthur

05:31.385 --> 05:32.952
visits Joanie's grave every Sunday?

05:32.954 --> 05:35.387
Oh, that's really sweet.

05:35.389 --> 05:38.891
Also impossible, since
Joanie was cremated.

05:38.893 --> 05:40.659
- What?
- Yeah.

05:40.661 --> 05:42.361
I was there when Arthur spread her ashes

05:42.363 --> 05:43.929
over Wrigley Field.

05:43.931 --> 05:45.497
It was so beautiful.

05:45.499 --> 05:47.600
And kind of gross.

05:48.436 --> 05:50.536
- Some of it blew back on our nachos.
- Ugh.

05:52.173 --> 05:54.106
Why would he tell that to Maya?

05:54.108 --> 05:57.343
And, more importantly, where
is he going off every Sunday?

05:57.345 --> 05:59.311
Definitely suspicious.

06:00.915 --> 06:03.882
96, 97,

06:03.884 --> 06:07.553
98... Oh, hey, Maya.

06:07.555 --> 06:09.989
99, 100.

06:11.626 --> 06:13.592
Sweatpants.

06:13.594 --> 06:15.361
One word.

06:19.967 --> 06:22.935
Okay, kid, time to close up.

06:22.937 --> 06:25.704
And don't forget to
dump the day-old donuts.

06:25.706 --> 06:27.640
* Day-olds! *

06:27.642 --> 06:30.175
* Day-olds! *

06:30.177 --> 06:32.778
Hey, it's nice to see you
getting over your breakup.

06:32.780 --> 06:37.016
* Nadine dumped me, said I had to go home. *

06:37.652 --> 06:40.185
Spoke too soon.

06:40.187 --> 06:41.720
All right, it's Sunday night.

06:41.722 --> 06:43.088
He's getting ready to leave.

06:43.090 --> 06:45.624
Have you seen any clues as
to where he disappears to?

06:45.626 --> 06:48.127
No. I mean, I think it's just so weird

06:48.129 --> 06:50.429
that he would lie about
where his wife is buried.

06:50.431 --> 06:51.897
I mean, what else has he lied about?

06:51.899 --> 06:54.933
Is his last name even Przybyszewski?

06:54.935 --> 06:57.269
I don't think that's
something you'd lie about.

06:57.271 --> 06:58.837
Mmm.

06:58.839 --> 07:01.407
This whole thing is so unlike him.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.842
It's not like he's a man of mystery.

07:03.844 --> 07:07.212
Even though he is shaped
like a question mark.

07:10.951 --> 07:12.084
Jake.

07:12.086 --> 07:13.552
Arthur.

07:13.554 --> 07:15.220
What are you doing here?

07:15.222 --> 07:17.022
I was in the neighborhood.

07:17.925 --> 07:19.925
I thought we could take a little walk.

07:19.927 --> 07:22.361
Okay.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.199
Who the hell was that?

07:27.201 --> 07:29.034
I don't know, but we better follow him

07:29.036 --> 07:31.036
before Arthur's sleeping
with the gefilte fishes.

07:31.038 --> 07:32.237
Okay.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.308
I don't see him.
You sure he came this way?

07:36.310 --> 07:37.643
Yeah.

07:37.645 --> 07:39.611
Saw him come down these steps.

07:39.613 --> 07:42.614
Man, why is Arthur in a
Catholic church anyway?

07:42.616 --> 07:44.373
I thought he went to Jewish church.

07:44.545 --> 07:48.687
Well, maybe he's doing a little
religion comparison shopping.

07:48.689 --> 07:50.556
People his age do that
when they get closer

07:50.558 --> 07:52.357
- to the check-out line.
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.359 --> 07:54.693
Maybe he's in here. Let's look.

07:54.695 --> 07:56.729
Oh, no, no. Uh-uh. I feel a little weird

07:56.731 --> 07:58.997
spying on someone in church.

07:58.999 --> 08:00.332
When I was in the ninth grade

08:00.334 --> 08:02.067
I was making out with Tony Delvecchio

08:02.069 --> 08:04.470
in the confessional
when the priest came in.

08:04.472 --> 08:06.638
Then I had to confess my sins

08:06.640 --> 08:10.375
while simultaneously
committing at least three more.

08:11.512 --> 08:14.480
So I figure I'm on thin ice with God.

08:14.482 --> 08:17.416
Wow. Well, I'm not. Me
and God are like this!

08:18.452 --> 08:20.586
And that, my friends, is a true story.

08:20.588 --> 08:24.389
He's in a circle with a bunch of people.

08:25.793 --> 08:27.693
Now they laughing and clapping.

08:27.695 --> 08:30.129
Oh... Oh, this is worse than I thought.

08:30.131 --> 08:33.765
I think Arthur's taking an improv class.

08:33.768 --> 08:36.001
Thanks for the share, Bob.

08:36.003 --> 08:37.535
Who'd like to go next?

08:37.538 --> 08:39.738
Okay.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.774
Uh, hi, my name is Arthur,

08:41.775 --> 08:43.475
and I've got a gambling problem.

08:43.477 --> 08:44.576
Hi, Arthur.

08:44.578 --> 08:45.844
It's been four years since

08:45.846 --> 08:47.079
I placed my last bet.

08:47.081 --> 08:49.181
And I only miss it during the playoffs.

08:49.183 --> 08:50.749
And the regular season.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.330
And the preseason.

08:52.358 --> 08:53.858
And the draft.

08:56.690 --> 08:58.557
It's a support group.

08:58.559 --> 09:00.392
Arthur's a gambler.

09:00.394 --> 09:03.395
You mean like Kenny Rogers?

09:03.397 --> 09:05.931
Uh, let's get out of here. I
never should've come. Come on.

09:05.933 --> 09:09.468
No, no, no, no, no.
You're in the right place.

09:09.470 --> 09:11.203
We're gonna help you get through this.

09:11.205 --> 09:13.705
No, no, man, I was just
checking up on my friend, man.

09:13.707 --> 09:16.575
- I don't have a problem.
- Ah. That's what they all say.

09:16.577 --> 09:18.110
Randy?

09:18.112 --> 09:20.712
Sorry. I'm a bridge, not a spy.

09:22.416 --> 09:24.817
Hey, everybody. I got a newcomer.

09:24.819 --> 09:25.818
Franco.

09:25.820 --> 09:28.086
Hi, Franco.

09:28.088 --> 09:29.755
What the hell you doing here?

09:29.757 --> 09:31.857
I walked in the wrong room.

09:31.859 --> 09:33.692
It's... What are the odds?

09:34.628 --> 09:36.161
Sorry.

09:36.163 --> 09:38.797
But it won't happen
again, you can bet on that.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.301
I'm leaving now.

09:48.681 --> 09:51.014
Good morning. Donut and
coffee to go, please.

09:51.016 --> 09:52.549
- To go?
- Yes, sir.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.885
I got a full-time job at a call center.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.621
You are looking at a customer
service representative.

09:57.623 --> 09:59.323
Oh? Of what?

09:59.325 --> 10:02.225
I have no idea.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.361
But I would be happy to
transfer you to someone

10:04.363 --> 10:07.431
who can answer all of your questions.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.769
Oh, you're looking good, Tush.

10:12.771 --> 10:15.138
You got a court date in
a small Southern town?

10:16.709 --> 10:19.886
It's from the fancy section at Kohl's.

10:20.003 --> 10:20.811
It's behind the luggage,

10:20.813 --> 10:22.746
- so a lot of people miss it.
- Oh.

10:24.616 --> 10:26.083
Morning.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.787
Look, I ran off last night
before I could tell you...

10:30.789 --> 10:31.888
I'm sorry.

10:31.890 --> 10:34.524
Well, you should be.
And you had no right

10:34.526 --> 10:35.892
to trail me.

10:35.894 --> 10:37.961
At least you're not doing improv.

10:37.963 --> 10:40.764
You don't have to hide anymore, Arthur.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.466
I'm glad you're getting help.

10:42.468 --> 10:43.767
If there's something I
could do to help you...

10:43.769 --> 10:45.502
Look, that's none of
your business, okay?

10:45.504 --> 10:46.603
But we're friends, man.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.871
I tell you everything.

10:47.873 --> 10:49.006
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't.

10:49.008 --> 10:50.574
That's the trouble with your generation.

10:50.576 --> 10:53.276
You need to share every
detail of your lives.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.279
Here's a selfie of me and my patty melt.

10:56.915 --> 10:59.916
Aren't I fascinating?

10:59.918 --> 11:01.051
That was hurtful.

11:01.053 --> 11:02.519
Look, I'm just saying that

11:02.521 --> 11:04.621
there has to be some boundaries
between you and I, all right?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.556
I'm the boss, you're the employee.

11:06.558 --> 11:08.759
We don't have to tell
each other everything.

11:08.761 --> 11:10.027
Fine.

11:10.029 --> 11:13.497
And FYI, that patty melt was delicious.

11:17.870 --> 11:21.505
Coffee to go, please.

11:21.507 --> 11:23.173
Tush, my good friend.

11:23.175 --> 11:25.208
Tell me how your new job is going.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.412
Okay,

11:28.414 --> 11:30.514
but I'm on a 15-minute break.

11:30.516 --> 11:32.049
It would've been a 20, but somebody

11:32.051 --> 11:35.118
took Fat Shirley's macaroni
salad from the fridge,

11:35.120 --> 11:37.154
and Regular Shirley's getting the blame.

11:37.156 --> 11:39.856
So, of course, Gay Ted
called a meeting about it.

11:39.858 --> 11:42.225
Delightful. Can you please
put that in an e-mail

11:42.227 --> 11:45.128
so that I can savor all the details?

11:45.130 --> 11:46.663
Oh, thank you.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.864
Bye, Fawz.

11:47.866 --> 11:50.667
Get off my back! I'm trying!

11:53.072 --> 11:56.206
You know, I can't believe
Arthur kept this secret from me.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.241
I thought we were
supposed to be friends.

11:58.243 --> 11:59.709
You mean the way you were my friend

11:59.711 --> 12:01.611
when you ditched me
in a church basement?

12:01.613 --> 12:04.047
That's how horror movies start.

12:07.052 --> 12:08.952
Nadine.

12:08.954 --> 12:10.220
Franco.

12:11.723 --> 12:14.791
Sorry I haven't returned your calls.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.193
It's cool.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.327
It's all right.

12:17.329 --> 12:18.628
Just thought you, uh, lost your phone

12:18.630 --> 12:21.731
or choked on a piece
of sushi or something.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.468
What I need to say to you,

12:24.470 --> 12:26.403
I need to say in person.

12:29.108 --> 12:31.708
And in private?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.643
All right, let's go in the kitchen.

12:37.416 --> 12:38.715
Hmm.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.852
Gee, I, uh, wonder
what's going on in there.

12:41.854 --> 12:44.121
Maybe I should go in
and do my bridge thing.

12:44.123 --> 12:45.822
No, no, no, no.

12:45.824 --> 12:47.390
She wanted privacy.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.493
I know how to find out what's going on.

12:49.495 --> 12:50.961
You're not going in there, are you?

12:50.963 --> 12:52.462
Arthur, give me some credit.

12:52.464 --> 12:54.431
I'm going to hold this
up to the door and listen.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.166
No, no. No, you're not.

12:56.168 --> 12:57.234
Come on, Arthur.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.435
This is more exciting

12:58.437 --> 13:01.838
than the time Gay Ted
brought his wife to work.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.307
Now look, they went in there
because they wanted privacy,

13:04.309 --> 13:07.010
and that's exactly what we're...

13:07.012 --> 13:09.199
- What?
- It's Nadine.

13:09.230 --> 13:10.847
I think she's crying.

13:10.849 --> 13:13.483
And that's none of our business.

13:13.485 --> 13:15.485
Wow.

13:15.487 --> 13:18.578
She's really losing it.
But that's between them.

13:19.491 --> 13:21.825
Oh.

13:21.827 --> 13:23.860
I mean, full-on waterworks.

13:24.997 --> 13:26.429
No, Sweatpants.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.998
Get a bigger one.

13:30.536 --> 13:33.036
I'm sorry. It's just...

13:33.038 --> 13:35.338
It's so hard to tell you.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.007
Just come out and say it.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.544
Franco...

13:40.546 --> 13:42.012
I'm pregnant.

13:43.849 --> 13:45.882
What? What happened?

13:45.884 --> 13:47.184
One of them is pregnant.

13:47.186 --> 13:49.152
And I think it's Nadine.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.669
Franco and Nadine are having a baby.

13:56.739 --> 13:58.148
No, they can't.

13:58.245 --> 13:59.878
They're so young.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.747
Well, sure, they start out young,

14:01.749 --> 14:04.750
but before you know it,
they're walking and talking...

14:04.752 --> 14:05.917
No.

14:05.919 --> 14:08.553
I'm talking about Franco and Nadine.

14:08.555 --> 14:09.788
They're not ready for this.

14:09.790 --> 14:11.390
Ha! Tell me about it.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.793
I mean, the four of us in
that tiny studio apartment?

14:14.795 --> 14:17.429
And you know who's going to
end up doing all the work.

14:17.431 --> 14:20.932
I just hope Franco knows
what he's getting into.

14:20.934 --> 14:22.601
I mean, how well can he even know...

14:22.603 --> 14:24.403
Nadine!

14:24.405 --> 14:27.239
Hey, girl.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.740
Hey, Arthur.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.475
Yeah.

14:31.979 --> 14:34.413
I don't think those were tears of joy.

14:37.284 --> 14:40.252
Why does everyone look so shocked?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.087
Nadine's pregnant.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.790
Come on, Fawz, you can do this.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.625
Really?!

14:48.462 --> 14:50.829
Franco, I just heard

14:50.831 --> 14:52.597
about your baby.

14:52.599 --> 14:54.800
Congratulations, man!

14:57.838 --> 15:00.505
How do you even know a...

15:00.507 --> 15:02.307
Were you listening to my conversation?

15:02.309 --> 15:04.476
No, I heard it from Tush.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.179
You were eavesdropping?

15:07.181 --> 15:08.947
Uh, Arthur told me.

15:10.017 --> 15:11.083
You were eavesdropping?

15:11.085 --> 15:12.217
No.

15:12.219 --> 15:13.752
Okay, yeah.

15:14.588 --> 15:17.356
I heard crying, so I got concerned.

15:17.358 --> 15:19.091
I mean, this is life-changing, kid.

15:19.093 --> 15:20.559
I-If you want to talk about it...

15:20.561 --> 15:21.526
I don't.

15:21.528 --> 15:23.295
I'm-a tell you the same thing

15:23.297 --> 15:25.330
you told me three hours ago.

15:25.332 --> 15:27.432
You're the boss, I'm the employee.

15:27.434 --> 15:29.167
It's none of your damn business.

15:29.169 --> 15:30.369
Hey, you're the guy that followed me

15:30.371 --> 15:31.570
to my gamblers' group.

15:31.572 --> 15:33.205
Oh, you like to gamble?
'Cause I got some guys

15:33.207 --> 15:35.207
I play poker with if you want in.

15:35.209 --> 15:37.042
No.

15:37.044 --> 15:38.210
What's the buy in?

15:38.212 --> 15:40.879
He meant a support group.

15:40.881 --> 15:42.381
Well, how do you know that?

15:42.383 --> 15:43.949
Were you spying on me, too?

15:43.951 --> 15:46.017
Y-Yeah, but only because...

15:46.019 --> 15:48.820
What did you tell him?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.523
What, there's no respect
for privacy in this place?

15:51.525 --> 15:52.758
Yeah.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.528
Looks like this place
could use some boundaries.

15:56.530 --> 15:59.231
Randy, I thought you
were better than that.

15:59.233 --> 16:01.500
Yeah, and I thought you were my friend.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.536
Why would you lie about
going to visit Joanie's grave?

16:04.538 --> 16:05.604
When did I say that?

16:05.606 --> 16:07.506
In Maya's dissertation.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.741
What?

16:09.743 --> 16:11.276
How do you know what's in there?

16:11.278 --> 16:13.512
Tush read it.

16:14.915 --> 16:15.981
Thanks a lot.

16:15.983 --> 16:18.817
You're as bad as Loudmouth Shirley.

16:18.819 --> 16:22.154
How many Shirleys work at this place?

16:22.156 --> 16:24.723
How dare you read that? That's private.

16:24.725 --> 16:26.091
Oh, that's rich

16:26.093 --> 16:29.561
coming from the woman
who's been spying on us.

16:29.563 --> 16:30.762
I'm not spying on you.

16:30.764 --> 16:32.197
I-I'm studying you.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.566
I can't believe you think
I'm some pathetic loser

16:34.568 --> 16:36.001
who can't get a job.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.203
And I'm some heartless businessman

16:38.205 --> 16:42.040
who doesn't care about
his pathetic loser friends.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.042
You don't know what
you're talking about.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.478
All right, everybody. That's enough.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.848
I know we're all upset, but
Maya has never treated us

16:49.850 --> 16:52.184
with anything but kindness and caring.

16:52.186 --> 16:54.085
So let's not jump down her throat

16:54.087 --> 16:56.254
until we hear what she has to say.

16:56.256 --> 16:57.589
Thank you, Randy.

16:57.591 --> 16:58.924
Now talk fast.

16:58.926 --> 17:02.694
I'm not sure how long
this bridge is gonna hold.

17:02.696 --> 17:05.830
Look, what you read...
I wrote that months ago.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.299
Those were my first impressions.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.767
But-but then I got to know you.

17:08.769 --> 17:10.801
Like, look.

17:10.804 --> 17:12.369
Read.

17:13.173 --> 17:17.142
When I met Carl,

17:17.144 --> 17:20.078
"I considered him a sad failure"

17:20.079 --> 17:21.913
Not a great start.

17:23.684 --> 17:25.517
But by creating a life for himself

17:25.519 --> 17:27.419
outside the nine-to-five workforce,

17:27.421 --> 17:29.354
he is one of the happiest,

17:29.356 --> 17:30.722
and therefore most successful,

17:30.724 --> 17:33.525
people I have ever known.

17:33.527 --> 17:35.093
You really think that?

17:35.095 --> 17:36.795
I do.

17:36.797 --> 17:39.998
So do I.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.701
Hello, Gay Ted?

17:45.672 --> 17:47.472
This is Carl.

17:47.474 --> 17:50.775
Bald Carl.

17:50.777 --> 17:52.177
Listen, I quit.

17:52.179 --> 17:55.247
And tell Fat Shirley to
lay off Regular Shirley.

17:55.249 --> 17:59.451
I'm the one that ate her macaroni salad.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.220
And Fawz.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.991
Despite his ruthless demeanor,

18:05.993 --> 18:09.828
Fawz has exhibited moments
of true caring and friendship.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.029
Aw.

18:11.031 --> 18:13.798
Happy now, you jerk?

18:13.800 --> 18:14.833
I am.

18:14.835 --> 18:16.134
But also exhausted.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.137
How are you people so nice
to each other all the time?

18:20.140 --> 18:21.706
What about me?

18:21.708 --> 18:23.475
I didn't even get one mention.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.743
That's not true.

18:24.745 --> 18:26.711
This is the conclusion.

18:26.713 --> 18:27.913
I wrote it this morning.

18:27.915 --> 18:29.047
Actually, Arthur,

18:29.049 --> 18:33.084
why don't you read it?

18:34.454 --> 18:37.822
You couldn't find a smaller font?

18:40.561 --> 18:41.793
Ah...

18:41.795 --> 18:44.963
Superior Donuts is a gathering place

18:44.965 --> 18:48.099
where people, regardless
of race, age and background,

18:48.101 --> 18:52.170
have found a refuge in an
otherwise impersonal city.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.239
This is best illustrated

18:54.241 --> 18:57.709
by the unlikely friendship
between Arthur and Franco.

18:58.979 --> 19:01.146
Arthur provides his young employee

19:01.148 --> 19:04.049
with a stable home beyond the apartment

19:04.051 --> 19:06.384
he shares with his roommate,

19:06.386 --> 19:10.355
a free-loading slacker named Sweatpants.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.693
- I'm in the book!
- Okay.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:23.815 --> 19:24.916
Here.

19:25.963 --> 19:27.228
You think you're gonna
make everything right

19:27.230 --> 19:28.863
by giving me some lame-ass gift?

19:28.865 --> 19:31.333
It's not for you. It's for your kid.

19:33.403 --> 19:36.204
I will love him no matter what.

19:36.206 --> 19:39.841
But please, God, don't
let him be a White Sox fan.

19:40.644 --> 19:43.044
Thank you.

19:43.046 --> 19:44.479
I can't take it.

19:45.716 --> 19:47.782
Look, I know what I
said about boundaries,

19:47.784 --> 19:50.352
but, you know, I realized
that like it or not,

19:50.354 --> 19:53.054
you and I, we're way past that.

19:53.924 --> 19:55.957
The thing is...

19:55.959 --> 19:57.759
it's not my kid.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.527
What?

19:59.529 --> 20:02.364
Apparently Nadine was
engaged to this guy,

20:02.366 --> 20:04.666
and he broke it off with her.

20:04.668 --> 20:06.568
I was the rebound.

20:06.570 --> 20:09.704
Wow, that's tough.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.775
Oh, come on. You're too
young to have a kid, anyway.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.778
You barely can take care of Sweatpants.

20:17.848 --> 20:20.882
Look, I, uh, I'm sorry I eavesdropped.

20:20.884 --> 20:22.617
I was gonna tell you anyway, man.

20:22.619 --> 20:23.852
I was just...

20:23.854 --> 20:26.755
It's humiliating. You know?

20:26.757 --> 20:28.189
No, I get it.

20:28.191 --> 20:30.291
That's why I didn't tell
you about my gambling.

20:30.293 --> 20:32.394
I was afraid you wouldn't
look at me the same.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.928
And I kind of like to think

20:33.930 --> 20:35.463
that you look up to me.

20:35.465 --> 20:36.564
Huh.

20:36.566 --> 20:37.699
That's weird, 'cause I always thought

20:37.701 --> 20:40.468
you looked up to me, but whatever.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.104
So, you gonna be okay?

20:43.106 --> 20:46.307
Eventually.

20:50.414 --> 20:52.546
Oh, I got pies stashed
all over this bitch.

20:52.593 --> 20:53.078
Oh.
