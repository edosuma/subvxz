08:43.523 --> 08:44.691
in the Financial District.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.861
My name is Kanae.
I am 25 years old.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.297
I am working underneath
Chef Eric Greenspan.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.766
‐Wow.
‐My name is Jose.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.702
I am currently a chef de cuisine
at Il Pesce at Eataly

08:55.702 --> 08:56.669
‐in New York City.
‐Wow.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.072
Geez. I'm really surprised

08:59.072 --> 09:01.007
at everybody's resume so far.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.909
<i>It's very impressive.</i>

09:02.909 --> 09:04.244
I think that there's
definitely gonna be

09:04.244 --> 09:05.612
a good competition here.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.113
(applause)

09:07.113 --> 09:09.182
Young man, please, stand up.
Give us your name, age,

09:09.182 --> 09:10.950
and what is your ambition?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.186
All righty. I'm Scott.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.289
I'm 39 years old.
I own a restaurant

09:16.289 --> 09:18.058
‐in Cleveland, Ohio.
‐Hold on, stop.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.627
You own.
<i>(music stops)</i>

09:20.627 --> 09:22.429
I own a restaurant
in Cleveland, Ohio.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.997
Wow. Scott, what the [bleep]
are you doing here?

09:23.997 --> 09:27.000
(laughter)

09:28.101 --> 09:30.036
Is it going as well
as you thought it was?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.704
It is.
We are doing very well.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.174
I've learned from
my past employers.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.142
‐Like who?
‐I've worked for Charlie Palmer

09:36.142 --> 09:37.644
‐from Aureole.
‐Wow.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.379
Barry Dakake at N9NE.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.014
Chef Govind Armstrong,
here in Los Angeles.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.516
Donald Barickman from Magnolias
in South Carolina.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.119
Eric Ripert. Thomas Keller,
I've worked with him.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.887
‐Who's Thomas Keller?
‐Thomas comes in

09:47.887 --> 09:49.322
six, seven down the line.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.525
Right, young lady,
please stand up.

09:52.525 --> 09:55.895
Give us a name, age,
and what's your ambition?

09:55.895 --> 09:59.365
Hi, Chef. My name's Mia Castro.
I'm from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.334
I'm 28 years old.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.404
I think people underestimate me
because of the way I look

10:04.404 --> 10:06.773
and because I smile a lot.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.075
I worked for Chef Thomas Keller
at Bouchon

10:09.075 --> 10:12.479
‐and Chef Wolfgang Puck.
‐Incredible.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.881
The other chefs have no idea.
I'm gonna kick ass

10:14.881 --> 10:16.483
in Hell's Kitchen.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.684
(applause)

10:17.684 --> 10:19.752
Wow, that is
an impressive lineup.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.022
Thank you. Right. Let's begin on
this side of the table.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.458
Please, stand up.
Give us the name, age,

10:25.458 --> 10:28.128
and what is your ambition?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.730
I currently am
the executive chef

10:30.730 --> 10:33.366
that oversees 36 restaurants.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.735
both: Wow.
‐And I have to apologize

10:35.735 --> 10:38.304
to you all because I haven't
been completely honest with you.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.907
<i>(dramatic music)</i>

10:40.907 --> 10:42.609
My name's not Maria, actually.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.278
Something is smelling
a little fishy,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.447
and it's not the risotto.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.682
My name's Ariel,
and I came in third

10:49.682 --> 10:51.417
on season six of
"Hell's Kitchen."

10:51.417 --> 10:53.219
What the hell?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.855
Ohh, [bleep].

10:57.223 --> 10:58.791
Ooh.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.269
<i>(dramatic music)</i>

11:09.269 --> 11:12.774
<i>NARRATOR: A new group of ches</i>

11:12.774 --> 11:14.243
I have to apologize
to you all

11:14.243 --> 11:16.612
because I haven't been
completely honest with you.

11:16.612 --> 11:19.848

My name's not Maria, actually.

11:22.451 --> 11:25.087
What the hell?

11:25.087 --> 11:27.523
My name's Ariel,
and I came in third

11:27.523 --> 11:29.458
on season six
of "Hell's Kitchen."

11:29.458 --> 11:31.126
(applause)

11:31.126 --> 11:33.829
Amazing. Welcome back.

11:33.829 --> 11:35.964
Oh, my God.
Seriously, is this happening?

11:35.964 --> 11:39.501
I invited Ariel back,
personally.

11:39.501 --> 11:42.571
I felt that she deserved
one more chance.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.574
(laughs) And the plot thickens.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.143
What's the reason
for coming back?

11:48.143 --> 11:50.546
I have been pushing myself
like you wouldn't believe

11:50.546 --> 11:52.080
‐for the last ten years.
‐Good.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.516
Some people said I lost 'cause
I wasn't confident enough.

11:54.516 --> 11:56.518
Would you send that lamb
if you were standing

11:56.518 --> 11:59.121
at the Araxi restaurant‐‐
Whistler‐‐on the hot plate?

11:59.121 --> 12:00.522
‐No, Chef. No, Chef.
‐Tell me!

12:00.522 --> 12:02.257
‐[bleep]!
‐I know that I have

12:02.257 --> 12:04.159
everything that it takes
this time around

12:04.159 --> 12:05.460
to win "Hell's Kitchen."

12:05.460 --> 12:08.497
I'm a boss now,
and I'm in this to win.

12:08.497 --> 12:10.599
‐Right, young lady.
‐G'day mate.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.601
(laughter)

12:12.601 --> 12:15.304
Hello, everyone.
For the last seven years,

12:15.304 --> 12:18.373
I've worked as a private
concert tour catering chef,

12:18.373 --> 12:21.777
traveling around the world with
Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga,

12:21.777 --> 12:24.012
‐Usher, Jay Z, Beyoncé.
‐Wow.

12:24.012 --> 12:25.581
Oh, and forgot to mention,

12:25.581 --> 12:28.884
I'm Jen from "Hell's Kitchen"
season four!

12:28.884 --> 12:32.220
(applause)

12:32.220 --> 12:34.122
Wow. Welcome back.

12:34.122 --> 12:35.691
Chef, it's been ten years

12:35.691 --> 12:37.326
and I'm ready to show you
that I've let go

12:37.326 --> 12:41.463
of my wanker ways and I'm
definitely a nice girl now.

12:41.463 --> 12:42.497
Have you got the garnish
for the salmon?

12:42.497 --> 12:44.533
No, I didn't hear that either.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.602
Hey, you know you look at me
when you talk to me.

12:46.602 --> 12:48.136
I just said no. I was putting my
food in here, Chef.

12:48.136 --> 12:49.805
Hey, hey, look at me.

12:49.805 --> 12:51.673
You're one [bleep] cocky lady

12:51.673 --> 12:52.975
for someone who knows
jack [bleep].

12:52.975 --> 12:54.443
‐You know that?
‐Yes, sir.

12:54.443 --> 12:55.644
You're so far up your own
[bleep], you don't know

12:55.644 --> 12:57.079
how [bleep] cocky you are.

12:57.079 --> 12:58.714
I can't tell you
anything anymore.

12:58.714 --> 13:00.248
I can't even give you
any direction.

13:00.248 --> 13:03.185
Welcome back. Young lady,
credentials first, please.

13:03.185 --> 13:06.355
Chef, I love you dearly,
but this thing gotta go.

13:06.355 --> 13:08.690
I was a runner‐up on season 16.

13:08.690 --> 13:11.893
My name's Heather. That door
is mine, this time, guys.

13:11.893 --> 13:13.929
<i>(dramatic music)</i>

13:13.929 --> 13:15.897
Three.

13:15.897 --> 13:18.066
Ahh!

13:18.066 --> 13:21.303
Heather, well done.
Come here.

13:21.303 --> 13:23.672
Get that head up high.
Well done, my ear.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.474
Thank you.

13:25.474 --> 13:28.076
Young lady, you were that close.

13:28.076 --> 13:29.111
I fought like hell, Chef.

13:29.111 --> 13:30.612
I feel like I haven't left.

13:30.612 --> 13:33.048
Amazing. Have you guys clicked
to what's happening, yet?

13:33.048 --> 13:34.449
‐Yes, Chef.
‐Yes, Chef.

13:34.449 --> 13:36.385
I'm really not intimidated
by the all‐stars at all.

13:36.385 --> 13:39.755
<i>Most of their food is probaby</i>
<i>outdated anyways.</i>

13:39.755 --> 13:41.990
They're here as has‐beens.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.825
Just because they didn't
do it the first time,

13:43.825 --> 13:46.194
maybe they can do it again.

13:46.194 --> 13:48.797
‐But they won't.
‐Let's meet our next surprise.

13:48.797 --> 13:50.432
Please, stand up.

13:50.432 --> 13:53.468
My name's Kevin. I'm actually
the runner‐up from season six.

13:53.468 --> 13:54.870
GORDON: Wow.
(applause)

13:54.870 --> 13:56.104
GORDON: Kevin.
‐Trevor.

13:56.104 --> 13:58.540
GORDON: Trev.
(applause)

13:58.540 --> 14:00.308
‐Season eight.
‐Final four.

14:00.308 --> 14:03.979
You may know me
as season 14's runner‐up.

14:03.979 --> 14:05.714
‐You can call me T.
‐T.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.983

14:07.983 --> 14:09.418
<i>CHRIS: What the hell is</i>
<i>happening right now?</i>

14:09.418 --> 14:12.421

<i>Wig hair's going everywhere,</i>
<i>mustache hair</i>

14:19.795 --> 14:22.431
Ahh, it's [bleep] weird. Weird.

14:22.431 --> 14:24.866
Right, uh, next.

14:24.866 --> 14:27.436
My name is not Eugene.
It's actually Bret

14:27.436 --> 14:28.937
from season 14.

14:28.937 --> 14:30.806
But I'm currently the personal
chef for some celebrities

14:30.806 --> 14:33.141
the likes of Sean Combs
down in Miami.

14:33.141 --> 14:35.043
More importantly,
how's the back?

14:35.043 --> 14:37.112
Amazing. I feel like
a million dollars.

14:37.112 --> 14:40.248
Leaving "Hell's Kitchen" in
season 14 due to my back injury

14:40.248 --> 14:41.883
was disgusting to me.

14:41.883 --> 14:44.386
BRET: Oh, [bleep]. Ahh.

14:44.386 --> 14:46.521
(groaning)

14:46.521 --> 14:49.024
BRET: Why? (groans)

14:49.024 --> 14:50.392
‐You okay?
‐I need a medic to

14:50.392 --> 14:51.827
‐the back of the kitchen.
‐Medic?

14:51.827 --> 14:54.096
Right now, you've gotta
think of yourself

14:54.096 --> 14:57.132
and not the Blue Team
and not "Hell's Kitchen."

14:57.132 --> 14:58.734
Good to see you.
Welcome back.

14:58.734 --> 15:00.502
Thank you, Chef.

15:00.502 --> 15:03.905
Right. Young lady, please
give us a little insight.

15:03.905 --> 15:06.208
I'm Roe.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.944
I finished fifth on season 13.
Black jacket.

15:08.944 --> 15:11.146
It was very difficult
not winning "Hell's Kitchen"

15:11.146 --> 15:12.914
the first time around.

15:12.914 --> 15:14.216
Everybody go to your station,

15:14.216 --> 15:16.084
whatever you're fired on,
that's priority.

15:16.084 --> 15:17.819
Whatever's dragging‐‐
risotto‐‐go.

15:17.819 --> 15:19.154
‐This is it.
BRUCE: Delicious.

15:19.154 --> 15:20.489
They're both cooked perfectly.

15:20.489 --> 15:21.823
You can cook at my house
any time.

15:21.823 --> 15:23.825
‐Thank you.
‐That doesn't stink of garlic

15:23.825 --> 15:25.093
‐to anybody here?
‐Yes, it does, Chef.

15:25.093 --> 15:26.795
Or is it you're all just
kissing Roe's ass?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.897
These little Bambis.
Let me tell you.

15:28.897 --> 15:32.000
You have no idea
what you're in for.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.503
The only ambition is to be
the executive chef

15:34.503 --> 15:35.771
of the "Hell's Kitchen"
restaurant.

15:35.771 --> 15:37.339
That's it.
There's no other ambition.

15:37.339 --> 15:39.708
That's the only ambition.
Love that attitude.

15:41.309 --> 15:43.512
Welcome back. Man!

15:43.512 --> 15:46.381
What we have here‐‐
for the first time ever‐‐

15:46.381 --> 15:49.885
it's rookies versus veterans.

15:49.885 --> 15:51.720
(cheers and applause)
Yeah!

15:54.289 --> 15:57.459
If they were previous
"Hell's Kitchen" winners,

15:57.459 --> 15:58.760
<i>I would be nervous.</i>

15:58.760 --> 16:00.662
But they're previous
"Hell's Kitchen" losers.

16:00.662 --> 16:01.997
So I'm like, whatever.

16:01.997 --> 16:05.233
We're rookies, but they lost.
We got this.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.737
Are you ready to do battle?
(all agreeing)

16:08.737 --> 16:11.173
All of you, head to
your kitchens, aprons on.

16:11.173 --> 16:14.409
Let's go. Line up behind
your dome, please.

16:14.409 --> 16:16.278
Rookies is just the name.

16:16.278 --> 16:18.580
<i>They're not novices</i>
<i>to cooking.</i>

16:18.580 --> 16:23.051
But rookies, you can't work
the line, you can't burn,

16:23.051 --> 16:24.586
you're going home,
point blank.

16:24.586 --> 16:27.055
All right. Scotley.
Give us the insight

16:27.055 --> 16:29.291
to your signature dish.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.625
You know, they call me
the Curry Chef

16:30.625 --> 16:32.093
because, you know,
my background Jamaican.

16:32.093 --> 16:35.297
So my signature dish
is pan‐seared snapper

16:35.297 --> 16:36.898
with a coconut curry sauce.

16:36.898 --> 16:38.366
Love it.

16:38.366 --> 16:40.101
Jen, give us an insight
to your signature dish.

16:40.101 --> 16:42.204
My dish is a classic Thai curry.

16:42.204 --> 16:45.307
I'm gonna do a lemongrass
scented king crab leg,

16:45.307 --> 16:46.975
little steamed mussels,
and of course,

16:46.975 --> 16:49.611
proper sticky rice, Chef,
in the banana leaf.

16:49.611 --> 16:51.279
‐Time to turn up.
‐Wow.

16:51.279 --> 16:52.614
Thank you!

16:52.614 --> 16:54.015
Is that a chef jacket
you got on?

16:54.015 --> 16:55.617
Is that your own line?
You designed that?

16:55.617 --> 16:58.854
‐Yes, Chef.
‐Wow.

16:58.854 --> 17:02.424
‐Do you fancy one?
‐Ah‐‐

17:02.424 --> 17:04.693
Maybe on my next visit
to the jungle, yes.

17:04.693 --> 17:06.361
(hooting)

17:06.361 --> 17:07.762
JEN: I'm about to bring
the beatdown.

17:07.762 --> 17:09.798
‐I've missed you.
‐I missed you too, Chef.

17:09.798 --> 17:11.032
Are those chef's jackets
selling well?

17:11.032 --> 17:12.767
‐Uh, yes.
‐They are.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.336
‐Yes.
‐How many have you sold?

‐Look at theirs.

Oh, no.

19:39.558 --> 19:41.193
I got a second opportunity.

19:42.995 --> 19:44.430
GORDON: Scott, give us

‐Damn, that chorizo smell good.

Right. T, first of all,
you are easily

22:48.981 --> 22:51.350
one of the most competitive,
determined chefs

Guys, come on.
Don't give up.

‐Christine, don't give up.
‐I am not giving up.

22:58.257 --> 23:00.860
I want a cigarette and a W.
Can you provide me with that?

23:00.860 --> 23:02.995
‐Is that passion still there?
‐Yes, it is, Chef.

23:02.995 --> 23:04.997
I just added a little bit more
desire to it.

23:04.997 --> 23:08.300
Last time, I didn't complete
the task at hand.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.670
<i>But I am reenergized,</i>
<i>reinvigorated.</i>

23:11.670 --> 23:12.938
I'm here to win.

23:12.938 --> 23:14.406
T, describe the dish, please.

23:14.406 --> 23:16.775
The seasoning is the sauce
that I did

23:16.775 --> 23:18.077
from the reduction of the beer.

23:18.077 --> 23:20.079
‐Little bit of Worcester sauce.
‐Mm‐hmm.

23:20.079 --> 23:21.714
Little bit of shallot, garlic.

23:21.714 --> 23:22.815
‐How is that, Motto?
‐Thought it was

23:22.815 --> 23:24.783
pretty bland, myself.

23:24.783 --> 23:26.352
You know what?
[bleep] you, Motto.

23:26.352 --> 23:28.587
‐The grits are bland for you.
‐Yes.

23:28.587 --> 23:30.489
I'm sure she's got great
skills and talents.

23:30.489 --> 23:32.391
But I just wanted some water
to wash down

23:32.391 --> 23:33.659
the rest of the grits.

23:33.659 --> 23:35.928
Seriously. The grits, delicious.

23:35.928 --> 23:39.131
Shrimp, slightly overcooked.

23:39.131 --> 23:40.733
Three out of five.

23:40.733 --> 23:43.002
Could've been a four,
had you got those shrimp right.

23:43.002 --> 23:44.236
Motto, give us
an insight to this.

23:44.236 --> 23:45.571
What's in there?

23:45.571 --> 23:47.006
MOTTO: It's a New Orleans
barbecue sauce.

23:47.006 --> 23:49.074
Plenty of sauce to soak up all
those great grits.

23:49.074 --> 23:52.044
Let's dig in.
What did you put in the grits?

23:52.044 --> 23:54.113
Just a little butter, cream,
salt and pepper

23:54.113 --> 23:55.414
and some lemon zest.

23:55.414 --> 23:57.616
Have a taste of that, please.

23:57.616 --> 24:00.152
What's the one thing they need?

24:00.152 --> 24:01.887
‐Salt, chef.
‐This is key for me.

24:01.887 --> 24:04.123
When you dump a huge plate
full of grits on there,

24:04.123 --> 24:06.458
they need to be seasoned.

24:06.458 --> 24:08.160
Shrimp cooked beautiful,
sauce amazing.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.895
Destroyed by the grits.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.697
That's a three out of five.

24:11.697 --> 24:14.333
Could have got four,
had you nailed those grits.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.702
Right, next up.
Fish stew with plantain.

24:16.702 --> 24:19.138

in the broth a little,

24:31.884 --> 24:35.721

are mashed.

Mm. That poor child.
Poor baby. Lord.

25:18.264 --> 25:20.867
Two elements done right.
One badly executed.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.235
Three out of five.

25:22.235 --> 25:23.103
Thank you, Chef.

25:23.103 --> 25:25.105
I shot myself in the foot

25:25.105 --> 25:27.140
with those smashed plantains.

25:27.140 --> 25:28.541
Won't do that again.

25:28.541 --> 25:29.909
Kevin, describe
the dish, please.

25:29.909 --> 25:31.444
KEVIN: When I saw that
it was a stew,

25:31.444 --> 25:34.814
being from New England,
a stew to me and chowder

25:34.814 --> 25:37.050
go hand‐in‐hand.

25:37.050 --> 25:39.719
So I kinda made my stew
with chowder essence.

25:39.719 --> 25:41.588
‐Is that the fried skin?
‐Yes, Chef.

25:41.588 --> 25:43.189

‐Damn straight.

28:32.558 --> 28:35.395
Have you managed to focus
on you and you only?

28:35.395 --> 28:38.464
Yes. Last time I was here, I had
real tough time with the chefs.

28:38.464 --> 28:41.434
I got yelled at by everybody
except for Chef Ramsay.

28:41.434 --> 28:44.103
<i>But this time around, working</i>
<i>with all‐stars and everything,</i>

28:44.103 --> 28:45.972
<i>I want their respect this time.</i>

28:45.972 --> 28:48.508
I want them thinking
that Trev's our go‐to guy.

28:48.508 --> 28:49.542
Describe the dish, please.

28:49.542 --> 28:50.977
TREV: I took a piece of snapper

28:50.977 --> 28:52.378
and dusted it
with a little curry,

28:52.378 --> 28:54.580
garam masala, saffron rice.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.882
‐Fish is delicious.
‐Thank you.

28:55.882 --> 28:58.184
The lemon twist reminds me
of the 1970s.

28:58.184 --> 29:00.386
My granddad's 90th birthday.

29:00.386 --> 29:04.157
‐Just old‐school.
‐This is old news, though.

29:04.157 --> 29:06.359
‐Three.
‐Thank you, Chef.

29:06.359 --> 29:08.394
Come on, man. You know
I'm better than a three.

29:08.394 --> 29:09.896
And I think that dish
was a little bit better

29:09.896 --> 29:11.064
than a three, too.

29:12.865 --> 29:16.202
Let's go for the grilled
pork loin chimichurri.

29:16.202 --> 29:18.404
Jen and Mia, please. Let's go.

29:18.404 --> 29:21.574
I'm quite nervous because
I definitely wanted to come in

29:21.574 --> 29:23.076
and make good flavors,
make something

29:23.076 --> 29:25.211
that Chef Ramsay
wouldn't spit out.

29:25.211 --> 29:26.779
Wow, interesting.

29:26.779 --> 29:29.082
Let's see how this goes.

29:29.082 --> 29:30.783
Jen, describe the dish, please.

29:30.783 --> 29:32.418
For the puree,
it's a potato puree

29:32.418 --> 29:35.555
with roasted plantain
and garlic.

29:35.555 --> 29:36.923
I have one big issue with that.

29:36.923 --> 29:38.791
When it starts to go ragged
like that on the outside

29:38.791 --> 29:40.393
‐what does that mean?
‐It gets a little dry, Chef.

29:40.393 --> 29:43.129
A little dry?
Cracks at the end.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.965
‐Jen, that's a two out of five.
‐Two.

29:45.965 --> 29:48.201
Two.

29:48.201 --> 29:50.336
This here ain't no fashion show.
We here to cook.

29:50.336 --> 29:54.240
So a two is unacceptable
in my book.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.608
Mia, describe the dish, please.

29:55.608 --> 29:58.411
So this is a grilled
pork loin medallion

29:58.411 --> 30:00.780
with chorizo chimichurri.

30:00.780 --> 30:01.881
That is delicious.

30:01.881 --> 30:03.249
Can I just check something?

30:03.249 --> 30:06.018
Wow, pink.
And again, pink.

30:06.018 --> 30:10.757
Amazing. Mia, that's
a very strong five.

30:10.757 --> 30:12.425
‐Great job.
‐Thank you, Chef.

<i>I'm jumping up and down inside.</i>

reckoned with.

30:21.801 --> 30:25.071

comes down to the final dish.

‐Us.

‐Oh, God.

30:55.067 --> 30:57.069
Him and I don't speak
at all anymore.

30:57.069 --> 30:58.905
Right. Let's start off
with Gizzy.

30:58.905 --> 31:00.273
Describe the dish, please.

31:00.273 --> 31:01.641
It's a little bit of
a tableside pour, here.

31:01.641 --> 31:06.612
We have a cucumber
and marcona almond gazpacho.

31:08.514 --> 31:10.283
‐That's delicious.
‐Thank you.

31:10.283 --> 31:11.551
I'm not gonna give it a score,

31:11.551 --> 31:13.252
'cause I wanna taste
both dishes first.

31:13.252 --> 31:15.254
‐Heather.
‐I did the pan‐seared scallop.

31:15.254 --> 31:16.756
I just stuck to salt and pepper.

31:16.756 --> 31:18.724
‐And why the brioche?
‐'Cause I wanted to make sure

31:18.724 --> 31:20.126
