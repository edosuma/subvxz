WHO DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.797
- LOOK,
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.008
TRY NOTICING SOMETHING ABOUT HER
AND ASK ABOUT IT.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.177
SHE'LL ANSWER,
YOU'LL SAY SOMETHING BACK,

09:13.261 --> 09:15.137
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT
YOU'LL BE TALKING.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.264
- I CAN DO THAT.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.682
I'M A DETECTIVE.
I NOTICE THINGS.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.642
- ALTHOUGH EVEN DETECTIVES
CAN BE BLIND

09:19.725 --> 09:20.810
TO WHAT'S RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THEM.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.896
- HA, NOT THIS DETECTIVE.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.443
- I'M JUST SO NERVOUS.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.821
I MEAN, JOY IS AMAZING,

09:31.904 --> 09:36.325
BUT SHE'S LIKE A 9.2,
AND I'M A 6.3.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.661
ALTHOUGH SOME WOMEN
HAVE DRUNK ME UP TO A 6.9.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.040
- OH.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.293
- OH. SORRY.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.961
- I WOULD SAY IT'S OKAY,

09:47.044 --> 09:49.672
BUT YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO TALK TO YOU.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.507
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT KIND OF A GABBY LOSER

09:51.591 --> 09:53.134
IS SITTING NEXT TO YOU.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.594
- [laughs]
BEEN THERE.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.804
JOEL MANDEL.
- [sighs]

09:56.887 --> 09:59.640
- I WORK FOR PRICE WATERHOUSE.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.684
- PRICE WATERHOUSE?

10:01.767 --> 10:05.396
THE ACCOUNTANTS WHO TALLY UP
THE ACADEMY NOMINATION BALLOTS?

10:05.479 --> 10:07.732
YOU HANDLE THAT ACCOUNT?

10:07.815 --> 10:11.152
- WELL, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO SAY.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.529
ALTHOUGH I HAVE IN THE PAST.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.406
IN FACT,
LAST YEAR I WAS UP ONSTAGE

10:15.489 --> 10:18.576
HOLDING THIS VERY BRIEFCASE.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.369
- I THOUGHT SO.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.914
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
SAYING TO MYSELF,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.250
WHO IS THAT DROP-DEAD
GORGEOUS ACCOUNTANT

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
NEXT TO RYAN GOSLING?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.545
- [laughing]

10:29.628 --> 10:32.214
THAT WAS ME!
- OH.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.012
- HI.
- HI.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.723
- SO...

10:40.806 --> 10:44.101
YOU LIKE PENIS?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.936
[stammering]
I MEAN PEANUTS!

10:46.020 --> 10:48.606
P-PEANUTS.
I--

10:48.689 --> 10:49.732
I MEANT PEANUTS,
'CAUSE YOU'RE EATING--

10:49.815 --> 10:51.400
THOSE ARE PEANUTS.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.735
I'VE GOTTA STOP
SAYING "PEANUTS."

10:52.818 --> 10:54.487
I GOTTA GO.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.328
- I'M SO GLAD MELANIE
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SECRET CRUSH.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.081
- AS AM I.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.624
- I NEVER WOULD'VE GUESSED.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.251
I MEAN, EVEN NOW
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T LIKE ME.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.295
AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING--

11:11.379 --> 11:13.631
"OH, NATE. HE'S MADE OF NUMBERS,
LIKE A COMPUTER."

11:13.714 --> 11:15.883
[laughs]

11:15.966 --> 11:17.218
BUT, UH, ANSWER ME THIS.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.137
CAN A COMPUTER MAKE OUT
WITH A HUMAN?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.391
IT CANNOT.
TRUST ME.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.477
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.982
GOD, I'M A WRECK!

11:32.066 --> 11:34.735
- CAN'T HELP YOU.
KEEP MOVING.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.448
- I DON'T WANT YOUR BOOZE.
I WANT YOUR ADVICE.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.784
I HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE IN LOVE WITH NATE

11:41.867 --> 11:44.286
FOR ANNOYING, NOBLE REASONS
I CAN'T GET INTO,

11:44.370 --> 11:45.913
BUT I DON'T THINK
I CAN PULL IT OFF.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.748
- YOU CAN'T UPSET HIM.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.500
I NEED HIM
TO WIN THE ELECTION.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.962
- I APPLAUD YOU
FOR YOUR DREAM, ELKA, BUT NO!

11:53.045 --> 11:55.423
- YOU'VE SLEPT
WITH THOUSANDS OF GUYS.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.299
WHAT'S ONE MORE?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.301
DO IT.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.431
- CAN I TALK TO YOU, JOY?
IT'S URGENT.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.167
- MY HUSBAND
HAS A BUCKET LIST.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.462
- [sighs]

12:34.545 --> 12:36.046
I'M GETTING NOWHERE
WITH MELANIE.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.007
I NEED CONVERSATION PRACTICE,
JOY.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.509
- [sighs]
FINE.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.511
JUST RELAX AND TALK.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.180
I'LL START.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.682
SO, MITCH, WHAT GOT YOU
INTO DETECTIVE WORK?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.726
- OH, I STARTED OUT
AS A COP,

12:48.809 --> 12:50.227
BUT AFTER YOU EAT
SO MANY DOUGHNUTS,

12:50.311 --> 12:53.481
YOU COME TO REALIZE THAT
THE REAL HOLE IS IN YOUR CENTER.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.524
- OH, THAT'S SAD.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.193
THERE'S A SADNESS ABOUT YOU.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.361
- WHICH MELANIE WILL HATE.
- NO!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.906
NO, WOMEN LIKE
THAT VULNERABILITY.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.241
NOW LET'S FIND COMMON GROUND--
BOOKS, MOVIES.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.743
WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

13:05.826 --> 13:08.162
- WELL, AS A DETECTIVE,
I LIKE PETER DIAMOND MYSTERIES.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.372
- I LOVE PETER DIAMOND!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.833
HOW ABOUT MOVIES?
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED <i> CASABLANCA.</i>

13:12.917 --> 13:15.544
- I'VE ONLY SEEN IT
ABOUT 20 TIMES.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.338
- DID YOU KNOW, AT THE END,
WHEN THEY'RE ON THE RUNWAY--

13:17.421 --> 13:19.381
- THE ACTORS IN THE BACKGROUND
ARE LITTLE PEOPLE,

13:19.465 --> 13:20.382
AND THE AIRPLANE
IS CARDBOARD?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.010
- YES! THAT JUST MAKES ME
LOVE IT EVEN MORE.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.346
- ME TOO.
THIS IS FUN.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.598
- YES.
I'M HAVING A LOVELY TIME.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.351
- GOOD.
THEN I'M READY FOR MELANIE.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.692
SO...
[laughs]

13:38.776 --> 13:41.445
ME AGAIN.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.948
I'M SORRY WE GOT OFF TO SORT OF
AN AWKWARD START THERE.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.242
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
- SO WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.578
-<i> PRINCESS BRIDE.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:51.080
- I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.749
- "INCONTHEIVABLE"!

13:53.832 --> 13:56.377
- I'M SORRY?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.255
- THAT'S A LINE
FROM THE MOVIE.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.549
- I HAVE NOT SEEN
THAT MOVIE.

14:01.632 --> 14:05.219
EXCUSE ME.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

14:08.764 --> 14:09.765
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT BRIEFCASE?

14:09.848 --> 14:11.725
- THE GUY FROM PRICE WATERHOUSE
JUST FELL ASLEEP.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.394
I NEED TO BREAK INTO THIS CASE

14:13.477 --> 14:14.603
AND SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY OSCAR BALLOTS INSIDE.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.064
- NO!
VICTORIA, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

14:17.147 --> 14:19.775
- OH, I THINK I CAN.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.278
YOU FORGET I DID
A TWO-EPISODE ARC ON <i> MACGYVER.</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:25.739
ALL I NEED IS A PAPER CLIP,
HAIR SPRAY, AND SOME MATCHES.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.951
- NO, VICTORIA.
[groans]

14:29.034 --> 14:31.078
- THAT WAS A DISASTER.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.747
WITH YOU,
IT'S SO EFFORTLESS.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.417
IT'S SO MUCH HARDER WHEN YOU
HAVE FEELINGS FOR THE PERSON.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.754
[alarm blaring]

14:40.838 --> 14:42.631
[Victoria screams]
- MY HAIR! HELP!

14:42.715 --> 14:45.301
- I'LL SAVE YOU, MELANIE!

14:54.935 --> 14:59.481
- VICTORIA,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.567
- WHY AM I THE BAD GUY?

15:01.650 --> 15:04.320
ALTHOUGH,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.238
ON <i> MACGYVER</i>
I WAS THE BAD GUY TOO.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.783
- YOU GOT US
KICKED OFF THE PLANE,

15:09.867 --> 15:12.328
AND NOW WE HAVE TO DRIVE ALL
NIGHT TO GET TO L.A. ON TIME.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.205
- I WAS DESPERATE TO FIND OUT
IF I'D BEEN NOMINATED OR NOT.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.625
NATE, HAVE YOU CRUNCHED
THE NUMBERS YET?

15:17.708 --> 15:20.628
- I HAVE, AND I WOULD NOT PUT
MONEY ON YOU BEING NOMINATED.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.338
- OH, GOD.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.214
SO I HAVE TO GET UP
IN FRONT OF BILLIONS OF VIEWERS

15:24.298 --> 15:25.758
WITH SINGED HAIR
AND NO SLEEP

15:25.841 --> 15:27.509
AND BE HAPPY FOR OTHER PEOPLE?

15:27.593 --> 15:30.387
[groans]
WHERE'S MY DAMN XANAX?

15:30.471 --> 15:33.015
- I'D JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT
HOW WELL MELANIE IS DRIVING.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.643
THUMBS UP, MEL.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.727
- THE GOOD NEWS IS,
VICTORIA,

15:36.810 --> 15:38.562
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR YOU TO HELP THE CAMPAIGN.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.147
- [sighs]
- I WAS THINKING,

15:40.230 --> 15:41.774
WHEN YOU GET UP IN FRONT
OF THOSE BILLIONS OF VIEWERS,

15:41.857 --> 15:44.026
WHY NOT MENTION OUR WEBSITE,
VOTEELKA.COM?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.527
- NO!

15:45.611 --> 15:48.030
NO, I HAVE TOO MUCH
TO TAKE CARE OF ALREADY.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.866
I HARDLY AM GONNA HAVE
ANY TIME TO GLUE ON EYEBROWS

15:50.949 --> 15:53.535
AND BUY A WIG AND--
AND GET MY DRESS READY.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.537
- I CAN HELP
WITH THE DRESS.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.041
AND JUST PLUCK SOME HAIR
OFF JOY'S ARM FOR YOUR EYEBROWS.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.837
- YOU KNOW, JOY,
I OWN THIS EXACT CAR.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.215
IT SEATS TWO ADULTS
AND FOUR CHILDREN.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.883
AND MY MOTHER.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.512
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, JOY?
- YEAH, I DID.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.393
- AND THE NOMINEES

16:17.476 --> 16:19.645
FOR BEST DIRECTION
IN A MOTION PICTURE--

16:19.728 --> 16:22.856
HAROLD ISRAEL
FOR <i> WINTERS LONG GONE.</i>

16:22.940 --> 16:24.316
- VICTORIA'S
HOLDING UP OKAY, RIGHT?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.068
- SURE!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.903
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
HIGHLY MEDICATED, DRUNK,

16:27.986 --> 16:29.863
AND HASN'T SLEPT
IN 36 HOURS,

16:29.947 --> 16:32.908
YOU MIGHT THINK,
"WHAT AN ODD WOMAN."

16:32.991 --> 16:35.244
- OH, NO, VICTORIA'S CATEGORY
IS COMING UP NEXT.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.621
- AND NOW BEST ACTRESS
IN A SUPPORTING ROLE.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.581
VICTORIA, THE NOMINEES?

16:39.665 --> 16:40.916
- YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?

16:40.999 --> 16:43.669
OH, LET'S SEE.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.796
MARION COTILL--

16:45.879 --> 16:49.842
YOU KNOW, THE FRENCH CHICK WHO
GETS NOMINATED FOR EVERYTHING.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.886
IVY JOHNSON
FOR <i> NIGHT OF THE HEREAFTER.</i>

16:52.970 --> 16:55.264
OH!
WELL, HERE'S A BIG SURPRISE.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.433
<i>DAMN</i> HELEN MIRREN.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.435
- THAT'S "DAME" HELEN MIRREN.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.228
- I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.938
OH, VIOLET HEMSWORTH.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.065
WELL, WE ALL KNOW
HOW SHE GOT NOMINATED,

17:05.148 --> 17:08.109
THE BIG SLUT.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.778
AND THE FINAL NOMINEE...

17:09.862 --> 17:13.949
IS VICTOR--

17:14.031 --> 17:17.035
OH, MY GOD!

17:17.118 --> 17:18.746
VICTORIA CHASE!

17:18.829 --> 17:20.414
- OH!
- SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT!

17:20.497 --> 17:22.915
- AND IT IS SUCH AN HONOR

17:23.000 --> 17:25.627
TO BE NOMINATED
WITH THESE AMAZING WOMEN.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.756
WE ARE ALL SO TALENTED.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.801
- IS EVERYTHING ALL READY?
- YEP, ALL SET.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.511
- WHAT?

17:34.595 --> 17:36.972
WHAT'S THIS?

17:37.055 --> 17:40.559
- WHO'S MACGYVER NOW?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.941
- OH, THANKS, ANGELINA.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.319
AND GIVE MY LOVE
TO BRAD, SHILOH, KNOX,

17:50.402 --> 17:53.322
VIVIENNE, PAX, ZAHARA,
AND MADDOX.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.658
- VICTORIA, YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER THE NAMES

17:56.742 --> 17:58.160
OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.955
- OH, I WILL, NOW THAT
THEIR MOTHER IS AN A-LISTER.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.999
- I MADE SUCH A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF

18:04.082 --> 18:05.793
WITH MELANIE ON THAT TRIP.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.171
- LOOK, YOU DON'T NEED TRICKS
OR SMOOTH LINES

18:09.254 --> 18:10.839
TO GET A GIRL LIKE MELANIE.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.633
JUST MAKE HER LAUGH.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.010
SHE'S A SUCKER FOR A GUY
WHO CAN MAKE HER LAUGH.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.054
- I GUESS
I COULD GIVE IT A SHOT.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.307
- TRUST ME--YOU'RE A--
A VERY APPEALING GUY.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.356
- [inhales]

18:27.439 --> 18:29.650
- [laughing]
[phone beeps]

18:29.733 --> 18:32.528
- OOH.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.029
OH, MY GOD, IT WORKED.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.073
ELKA, GREAT NEWS!

18:36.156 --> 18:37.574
THANKS TO THE DRESS STUNT,

18:37.658 --> 18:40.869
YOU ARE NOW FRONT-RUNNER
FOR CLEVELAND CITY COUNCIL!

18:40.953 --> 18:42.412
[excited chatter]

18:42.496 --> 18:44.206
- AND SPEAKING OF DRESSES,

18:44.289 --> 18:46.041
ARMANI, DIOR, AND VALENTINO

18:46.125 --> 18:49.378

OF DESIGNING MY OSCAR DRESS.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.754
[laughs]
[phone ringing]

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
OOH,
AN INTERNATIONAL NUMBER.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.842
HELLO?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.718
<i>KONBANWA!</i>

18:56.802 --> 18:58.512
IT'S THE MRS. LADYPANTS PEOPLE
CALLING FROM JAPAN

18:58.595 --> 19:00.013
TO CONGRATULATE ME.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.891
OH, THANK YOU!
UH-HUH.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.269
WHAT?

19:05.352 --> 19:08.814
[laughs]
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE?

19:10.023 --> 19:12.067
ALL RIGHT.
UH, YES.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.695
