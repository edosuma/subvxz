sweet-talk me, kiddo.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.004
GREG: Okay. Just a few--
few words of greeting,

20:14.880 --> 20:15.923
but, uh...

20:16.840 --> 20:19.134
And, hey, Mr. Pugh.
How are you?

20:19.217 --> 20:22.512
I'm not an uncomplicated man,
Greg. I know that.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.308
Nevertheless, I have tried
as much as I'm able

20:26.391 --> 20:28.143
to show you love and compassion.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.478
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

20:29.561 --> 20:32.022
You're the best
darn gramper out.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.858
Um, and I wanted, therefore,
to ask you--

20:34.942 --> 20:36.276
EWAN: You asked me for help.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.654
And I took
that request seriously.

20:40.405 --> 20:44.117
And now I hear that you've
dispensed with Roger's services,

20:44.201 --> 20:47.454
presumably to throw your lot in
with my brother

20:47.537 --> 20:50.415
and his gang of
crapulous shills,

20:50.499 --> 20:52.709
without even so much
as a telephone call?

20:53.210 --> 20:54.378
Right.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.671
I was actually wondering

20:55.754 --> 20:58.632
if I shouldn't maybe take
another turn around the block

20:58.715 --> 20:59.675
with old Mr. Pugh here--

20:59.758 --> 21:02.803
EWAN: I have known
Roger Pugh for 55 years.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.181
You don't take him
for a fucking ride anywhere.

21:07.265 --> 21:08.558
He's a friend of mine!

21:08.642 --> 21:09.935
I-- I mean-- I...

21:13.563 --> 21:15.983
Okay, I guess, the other route

21:16.066 --> 21:19.444
is to see
if there's any way that...

21:20.862 --> 21:22.406
you might see your way clear

21:22.489 --> 21:25.742
to providing a little
financial support to help me

21:25.826 --> 21:28.078
-retain my neutrality amongst...
-Roger?

21:28.161 --> 21:31.123
I'm helping your
grandfather transfer

21:31.206 --> 21:33.291
the entirety of his estate

21:34.084 --> 21:36.211
to charitable endeavors.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.046
What? Uh, what?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.298
I'm giving all my money
to Greenpeace, Greg.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.259
Um...

21:42.342 --> 21:44.344
What-- Even my part?

21:44.428 --> 21:45.637
That was the first part.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.598
Why? Why?

21:48.682 --> 21:51.977
Why is that the first part?
I mean, how do you...

21:52.060 --> 21:53.478
How can you tell?

21:53.562 --> 21:54.646
I mean...

21:55.605 --> 21:57.482
-Why?
-EWAN: Because, Greg...

21:59.109 --> 22:01.319
your life is not a bagatelle.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.530
Because you're putting yourself

22:03.613 --> 22:05.991
in the service
of a monstrous endeavor.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.076
Because...

22:09.870 --> 22:10.871
(SIGHS)

22:13.999 --> 22:17.502
Because you need to
take yourself seriously, kid.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.966
Now, we should go in.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.429
Okay, so just whip through it.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.222
Keep any dissent to a minimum.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.558
As soon as the deal's agreed,
we'll let you know

22:31.641 --> 22:34.186
and then you can announce that
the vote has been called off.

22:34.269 --> 22:35.437
Oh...

22:35.520 --> 22:37.522
Ger's sent her opening remarks,
so we got your back, okay?

22:37.606 --> 22:39.524
-Yeah.
-Good. Go get 'em.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.153
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

22:45.697 --> 22:47.365
FRANK VERNON: Hi, uh...

22:47.449 --> 22:49.576
I'm Frank Vernon, Vice Chairman.

22:49.659 --> 22:55.082
Welcome to Waystar Royco's 46th
Annual Shareholders' Meeting.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.793
All hail the conquering heroes!

-MARK RAVENHEAD: Hey!
-(LAUGHS)

23:00.212 --> 23:01.963
-(APPLAUSE)
-It's not a--

23:02.047 --> 23:04.549
It's not done deal, yet,
Con, you know.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.760
But we're close.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.304
I think the lawyers can
finesse the rest, yeah?

23:09.387 --> 23:10.347
GERRI: Yes.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.557
Dad, you would've
fucking loved it.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.809
Sandi is barely alive.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.311
You could've told him to go
fucking eat his own diaper

23:16.394 --> 23:17.479
and his only response would be,

23:17.562 --> 23:18.855
-(MUMBLES MOCKINGLY)
-(LAUGHTER)

23:18.939 --> 23:19.898
Fucking... (BLOWS A KISS)

23:19.981 --> 23:21.983
Wait, what? You did it?
You're on? We're on?

23:22.067 --> 23:25.195
-GERRI: Well we might--
-Hmm, yeah. They've got nowhere
else to maneuver, so.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.656
Well, they could've
said yes in Greece.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.492
-SHIV: (CHUCKLING) Yeah.
-Saved us all the ball-ache.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.786
GERRI: Still,
Logan, this is good news.

23:32.869 --> 23:33.954
Oh, yeah.

23:34.037 --> 23:37.749
-(GERRI CHUCKLES)
-Good for them and bad for us.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.335
SHIV: Dad, how can it be
bad for us?

23:40.418 --> 23:41.962
LOGAN: They were
always gonna settle.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
(LOGAN SCOFFS)

23:43.588 --> 23:45.841
Uh, something screwy going on.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.968
Do we give them a taste
of their own medicine?

23:49.636 --> 23:50.679
Let everyone know

23:50.762 --> 23:52.556
-that they bent for me?
-SHIV: Uh...

23:53.557 --> 23:55.851
Reopen the negotiation, Dad?

23:55.934 --> 23:58.520
No, we settle now
or we go to the vote and lose.

23:58.603 --> 24:02.274
Tell him he can't step foot
inside the building!

24:02.357 --> 24:05.777
Look, Logan, I know painful
this is but we need this.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.028
SHIV: Christ, Dad!
You just said

24:07.112 --> 24:08.697
it's not far off
what we originally offered.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.783
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
We fuck this deal

24:11.867 --> 24:13.660
and there are no more deals.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.043
Uh-huh? Okay.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.047
Great.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.717
Okay, thanks, Dad.
That's-- It's smart.

24:29.509 --> 24:30.510
It is.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.430
-Well done.
-CONNOR: Well done.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.015
-SHIV: Thanks.
-Well... done.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.141
Pills.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.643
COLIN: Sorry, sir. Advil?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.020
What do you think?

24:41.021 --> 24:41.980
Sir?

24:42.939 --> 24:43.940
About the deal?

24:45.942 --> 24:46.943
Could be good.

24:47.819 --> 24:48.862
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

24:49.696 --> 24:50.697
Get Advil?

24:51.698 --> 24:52.949
I'll get some Advil.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.410
FRANK: I would also like to
invite to the stage, Richard...

24:55.493 --> 24:56.703
Fucking Frank.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.080
It's humiliating.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.042
All these years,
he still has to play

25:02.125 --> 25:04.169
maitre'd at
the Bistro of Bullshit.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.962
(PHONE RINGS)

25:08.048 --> 25:09.591
Yeah, what?
I'm in the middle.

25:09.674 --> 25:13.345
BIANCA: Mr. Roy,
I'm sorry to bother you
but the rabbit is sick.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.430
What do you mean?

25:15.513 --> 25:17.265
The rabbit's sick?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.476
What-- what-- what kind of sick?

25:19.559 --> 25:22.103
How-- Did you call a vet?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.814
How-- How much bagel
did you give her?

25:24.898 --> 25:26.858
BIANCA: Not that much,
but I-- I did say

25:26.942 --> 25:29.069
that they're not supposed to
have bagels.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.030
Okay, you know what,
just figure it out, okay?

25:32.113 --> 25:33.573
Just call our doctor.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.368
BIANCA: But the doctor
does, uh, people?

25:36.451 --> 25:38.328
Yeah, if he can do people,
he can do rabbits.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.373
-Gerri!
-No!

25:41.998 --> 25:43.124
Hi, by the way.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.918
ROMAN: Um, is this
business or friendly?

25:45.001 --> 25:46.628
-Oh, sorry. I was just--
-SHIV: Hey, Karolina.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.463
How are you?
How's the release coming?

25:48.546 --> 25:49.631
Wait, almost.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.174
And who's, uh, gonna announce?

25:51.258 --> 25:52.676
-GERRI: I'll do it.
-KARL: I can do it.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.969
Oh, well...

25:55.053 --> 25:56.304
-(PHONE BUZZES)
-It's Sandi.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.681
-SHIV: What?
-CONNOR: Which one?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.183
The one who can talk.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.352
-(CHUCKLES)
-Yeah?

26:03.436 --> 26:04.479
Hey, Sandi.

26:05.855 --> 26:06.940
Uh...

26:07.023 --> 26:08.275
are you sure about that?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.026
Well, go on.

26:10.777 --> 26:11.820
All right, but...

26:12.696 --> 26:13.697
Seriously?

26:15.156 --> 26:16.157
Okay.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.119
So, they have one more proviso.

26:19.202 --> 26:21.496
They want to take away
the private jets.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.039
The PJs? No.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.374
"Elitist and out of touch."

26:24.457 --> 26:25.542
Well, duh, but no.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.252
That's just--
They're trying to humiliate him.

26:27.335 --> 26:30.672
Well, was it real, or are they
just basting the turkey?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.382
I-- Let's just eat it, Dad.

26:32.465 --> 26:33.842
You can tell them
to fuck off later.

26:33.925 --> 26:38.513
Yeah, we can just offer to cut
personal use or a mileage cap.

26:38.596 --> 26:42.642
Bullshit! No! First, they came
for the PJs and I said nothing.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.520
Then they come for the outsized
compensation payments, you know?

26:45.603 --> 26:47.314
This is-- No, this is bullshit.
They'll back down.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.982
They're not gonna
blow it up over this.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.358
Right?

26:50.692 --> 26:51.693
Dad?

26:52.652 --> 26:53.737
Hmm.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.822
-I need a piss.
-SHIV: Oh.

-LOGAN: Shiv.
-Uh, sure. Do you need some...

26:59.075 --> 27:01.536
help or-- I can call--
reach out to...

27:02.287 --> 27:03.288
You.

27:03.830 --> 27:04.831
Let's go.

27:04.914 --> 27:05.874
Stay.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.376
You-- You wanna
make a decision now?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.461

-What?

27:20.263 --> 27:21.639

I-- I-- What do I say?
Uh, boss--

27:24.809 --> 27:26.061

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
Okay, uh, what--

-Well, Stewy's not picking up.

-GREG: You got it, man!

27:43.078 --> 27:44.871
So, without further ado,

27:44.954 --> 27:47.665

to tell you, I believe,

27:47.749 --> 27:51.044
please welcome

Slow it down.
The deal may be off.

28:01.429 --> 28:04.516
Um, I-- I'm needed elsewhere.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.809
-So, uh...
-(LAUGHS)

Bonne chance, Franco.

(OVER MICROPHONE) Excellent!

28:11.147 --> 28:12.148
Wonderful news.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.485
Well, uh, in fact,
we will be hearing

28:15.568 --> 28:19.364
from our Chief Financial Officer
a little later, and before that,

28:19.447 --> 28:22.617
uh... a little further ado.
(CHUCKLES)

28:22.700 --> 28:24.577
In fact, uh, much ado.

28:24.661 --> 28:28.206
Much ado about, uh, something.

Logan, we can't wait any longer.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.382
-What do we say?
-Yeah. What's it gonna be, Dad?

28:37.465 --> 28:39.634
-GERRI: We need an answer.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

28:39.717 --> 28:41.428
What do you think, Logan?
Yes or no?

28:41.886 --> 28:43.221
(EXHALES)

28:46.516 --> 28:47.517
Fuck 'em.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.441
Fuck 'em!

SHIV: Uh, you sure, Dad? That--

28:57.485 --> 28:58.862
You sure you wanna do this?

Do you know something, or...

29:07.537 --> 29:10.498
GERRI: I mean, that is--
this is a huge call.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.666
Are we happy?

29:11.749 --> 29:13.042
Pills!

29:13.126 --> 29:17.130
I just gave you some, sir.
You need something else?

-Tylenol?
-(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

29:18.715 --> 29:21.009
Is he okay? I mean,
does this make sense?
Is he-- Is he okay?

29:21.092 --> 29:22.594
Yes, it makes sense.
He's fucking okay.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.804
Look, he's gambling the company
'cause he's a fucking badass.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.598
-He knows what he's doing.
-Um, was that a--

29:26.681 --> 29:29.058
that was a--
that was a clear no, right?

29:29.142 --> 29:31.686
He definitely said fucking no.
No deal.

29:31.769 --> 29:34.647
-SHIV: Did he? (GROANS)
-That was a definite no.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.649
ROMAN: Yeah, I mean, if we win

29:36.733 --> 29:38.276
without a deal
then it's all upside.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.487

on the fucking edge, and
I am not gonna let that happen.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.109
-Do you understand me?
-ROMAN: Yes.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.777
-SHIV: You're not welcome here.
-You fix it!

37:59.860 --> 38:01.487
You fucking fix it!

38:01.570 --> 38:03.489
-You may go. You're excused.
-You're not welcome.
You have no right to be here.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.075
-Please leave.
-Thank you very much for
your concern. Please, thank you.

38:06.158 --> 38:07.118
Go, delusional.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.452
Fucking delusional man
leaving the room.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.288
And figure out a fucking doctor
or I'm calling mine.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.665
-SHIV: Get the fuck out of here.
-Thank you so much
for your concern.

38:12.748 --> 38:13.833
Like you give a fuck!

38:13.916 --> 38:16.252
You probably slipped
him something, Putin. Fuck!

38:17.628 --> 38:18.546
SHIV: Dad.

38:18.629 --> 38:21.173
(MUTTERING FRANTICALLY)

38:21.257 --> 38:24.552
-Keep Frank on.
-LOGAN: Why is Frank so angry?

38:24.635 --> 38:28.097
-Oh, uh, that's Kendall.
-LOGAN: Is Frank upset?

38:28.180 --> 38:30.099
No, some people were
nasty to Frank.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.892
-It's fine now, though.
-Very mad, people were yelling.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.728
-LOGAN: Who was nasty to him?
-No, no, you sit down.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.855
-Don't worry, he's okay.
-LOGAN: Nobody should be...

38:35.938 --> 38:38.315
I'm the only one who's
allowed to be nasty.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.027
TOM: No, there were
some silly people
and they've gone now.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.320
(MUTTERING) Shit.

38:46.323 --> 38:48.576
And we will all
work together as a team

38:48.659 --> 38:51.495
to lead the company
to a brighter future.

38:59.670 --> 39:04.884
And now I will hand you over to
Gerri Kellman, our interim CEO.

39:05.676 --> 39:09.889
(APPLAUSE)

39:09.972 --> 39:11.307
You cowardly prick!

39:15.770 --> 39:17.021
Thank you, Frank.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.482
(SIGHS)

39:20.649 --> 39:22.818
I'd like to begin by reflecting

39:22.902 --> 39:25.321
on some of the many changes

39:25.404 --> 39:29.617
I have seen
in my 30 years at Waystar.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.912
SHIV: Hey!

39:32.995 --> 39:35.915
He's on fluids and hydrating.

39:35.998 --> 39:37.249
So it should be pretty quick.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.709
He's definitely gonna be okay?

39:38.793 --> 39:39.960
But, uh, how quick?

39:40.044 --> 39:42.755
Well, he's not
a cup of instant noodles.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.131
Sure, but can we speed it up?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.884
Like a blood bag
or an adrenaline shot?

39:46.967 --> 39:48.135
ROMAN: Geez.
Fucking take it easy.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.137
You wanna give him
the fucking Tabasco suppository?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.472
Fuck you! It's what he'd want.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.432
Fuck you. The main thing is
that we look after him, okay?

39:53.516 --> 39:55.059
Yeah, well, obviously
I agree, Roman.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.268
Oh, yeah? Really?

39:56.352 --> 39:57.812
'Cause it sounded like
you want to jumpstart our father

39:57.895 --> 39:59.772
like he's a fucking
pick-up truck.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.360
Oh, shit. Um, can you like
call me when he's less...

40:04.860 --> 40:05.861
scary?

40:06.821 --> 40:07.988
GERRI: ...positive direction.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.950
We will explore alternatives
for our cruise division,

40:11.033 --> 40:13.452
including a
possible divestiture.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.705
And we'll initiate
a share repurchase plan

40:16.789 --> 40:19.125
and a special dividend.
And we'll be forming...

40:19.208 --> 40:21.377
Doctor says he's gonna be fine,
but I don't know.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.504
-It's fine, he's asleep.
-GERRI: ...spearheaded by

40:23.587 --> 40:27.216
our visionary Chief Operating
Officer, Roman Roy.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.927
-(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
-GREG: Hey, yeah, yeah.

40:30.010 --> 40:33.889
I was-- I was wondering, just,
in your view

40:33.973 --> 40:37.476
do you think it's possible
to sue a person,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.687
uh, a grandparent for example,

40:39.770 --> 40:41.897
uh, in a way which is like...

40:43.023 --> 40:44.692
like in an affectionate way?

40:45.359 --> 40:46.986
That might convey, like,

40:47.069 --> 40:49.530
"I love you and, I'm glad you're
a part of my life,

40:49.613 --> 40:51.949
but I am taking
legal action against you"?

40:52.032 --> 40:53.951
-KARL: We're getting-- Just--
-KAROLINA: This isn't--

40:54.034 --> 40:56.495
This isn't turning
any floating votes our way.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.747
Should we, uh,
call in a bomb threat?

40:59.957 --> 41:01.292
-Hey!
-Okay.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.878
So, his moaning's
getting louder.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.046
Okay, but can he
do that on stage?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.674
-Is it a wheel on and wave?
-ROMAN: Fuck. Like we're not

41:08.757 --> 41:12.052
gonna make the piss-mad bear
dance with fucking cattle prods.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.596
We need to be
looking after him, okay?

41:13.679 --> 41:15.514
So, he's not
gonna do his speech?

41:15.598 --> 41:17.474
FRANK: Well...
Is-- Is he talking?

41:17.558 --> 41:20.561
Is that it though? Do we just--
Does, does that-- Do we go down?

41:20.644 --> 41:22.188
And fucking give up?

41:22.271 --> 41:23.522
-KARL: No.
-HUGO: No.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.524
SHIV: Maya!

41:25.608 --> 41:26.901
Talk to me.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.028
-Uh...
-SHIV: Come on!

41:29.111 --> 41:32.531
I would strongly urge you to do
whatever you can to settle.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.700
SHIV: Okay, I think
we go back to Sandy and Stewy

41:34.783 --> 41:36.285
-and try and save the deal.
-Yes.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.204
ROMAN: No. No, you can't.
Because Dad said no deal.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.914
-No, Dad didn't say shit, Rome.
-Dad said no deal!

41:39.997 --> 41:42.917
No, he didn't! His urethra had
wrested control from his brain!

41:44.126 --> 41:46.045
I at least talk to them, right?

41:46.128 --> 41:47.880
-TOM: Right.
-KARL: Yeah.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.965
'Cause if we go to the vote,
we probably...

41:50.049 --> 41:51.258
we lose. Karl?

41:52.468 --> 41:54.053
Um...

41:55.804 --> 41:56.764
-SHIV: Frank?
-Yeah.

41:56.847 --> 41:57.932
-SHIV: Tom? Yes?
-Yes, yes.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.017
-I say yeah.
-SHIV: Okay. Rome?
You back this?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.311
Um...

42:05.022 --> 42:07.524
Go on. Yeah.
Go fuck it up, moron.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.404
Hey!

42:12.488 --> 42:14.114
Uh, I was wondering
if we could have another chat?

42:14.198 --> 42:16.075
Just the two of us,
before the vote closes?

42:16.992 --> 42:18.869
Thank you for your support.

42:19.662 --> 42:23.165
This is the power of Waystar.

42:23.249 --> 42:27.419
A bright new beginning, but
the journey remains the same.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.046
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:33.008 --> 42:34.677
We at Waystar Royco...

42:34.760 --> 42:37.137
KAROLINA: She's dried up.
Just couldn't do it.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.307
She hit the video,
but we have to close this vote.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.767
This is it.

42:41.850 --> 42:44.311
Um, I've got
the White House on the line.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.730
Oh, yeah, they've been coming
at us from all sides

42:46.814 --> 42:47.856
since the ATN pivot.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.276
KERRY: It's not Michelle-Anne.
It's the President.

42:50.359 --> 42:52.945
He wants an urgent conversation.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.197
-Oh.
-On-- on that phone, now?

42:55.281 --> 42:58.534
Mm-hm. Yeah, I mean, on mute.
But it's the switchboard.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.286
He wants Logan.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.705
Right, well, that's not ideal.

43:02.788 --> 43:05.291
I mean, can we just say no?

43:05.374 --> 43:06.792
FRANK: Well, uh, how do we feel

43:06.875 --> 43:08.919
about saying no
to the President right now?

43:09.003 --> 43:11.171
Oh, I would love
to say no to the President.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.965
ROMAN:
I mean, he can't talk to Dad.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.925
Uh, can we just tell him
to fuck off?

43:15.009 --> 43:16.844
I mean, by all accounts,
he won't remember by tomorrow?

43:16.927 --> 43:19.221
KERRY: Yeah, I was wondering
if it might be about

43:19.305 --> 43:21.640
the DOJ and everything.

43:22.599 --> 43:25.769
I mean,
it's fucking late, but...

43:25.853 --> 43:30.524
if the pressure got turned down
and we can leak it and, uh,

43:30.607 --> 43:32.568
and then we throw Gerri
back up on stage

43:32.651 --> 43:34.278
-and just keep her talking--
-I can do it.

43:34.361 --> 43:35.571
TOM: I think-- No.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.990
I think, maybe, Shiv. Shiv.
Can we get Shiv back, Frank?

43:38.407 --> 43:39.325
Uh, Gerri!

43:39.408 --> 43:40.617
Gerri, hey, Gerri!
We need someone--

43:40.701 --> 43:42.995
Gerri, we need someone
sensible to talk to the, uh...

43:43.078 --> 43:44.455
-President right now...
-CONNOR: I can do it.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.123
...urgently on
an urgent personal matter.

43:46.206 --> 43:48.667
-Roman, you've met him, right?
-KAROLINA: Well--
well, if it's between--

43:48.751 --> 43:51.462
sorry, Roman and Gerri,
I would definitely--

43:51.545 --> 43:53.047
I'll talk to him,
the little bitch, here.

43:53.130 --> 43:55.841
Um, should we hurry?
Because I think
it's kind of urgent.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.968
I mean, I can do it, but...

43:58.052 --> 44:00.804
Roman, you get on
with them, right?

44:00.888 --> 44:03.766
I mean, if anyone here
is bootleg Logan,

44:04.266 --> 44:05.309
Roman...

44:07.311 --> 44:08.562
Okay, gimme.

44:08.645 --> 44:10.814
Just explain it's out of respect
and you can take the message--

44:10.898 --> 44:12.941
Yeah, yeah, I got it. It's just
the President. It's fine.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.527
HUGO: This guy? Tony Tourette's?
Are you kidding? Are you sure?

44:15.611 --> 44:17.071
-Don't swear at him!
-Oh, really?

44:17.154 --> 44:19.615
It's not cool to tell
the President to blow me?

44:19.698 --> 44:22.493
Hey, Mr. President.
This-- Sorry.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.411
Yeah, no--

44:24.495 --> 44:25.704
Cross-talk. You go.

44:26.955 --> 44:30.000
Yeah, no this is, uh, actually,
I'm his son, Roman.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.252
Yup, that one.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.755
Look, he can't talk
right now, but, uh...

44:35.547 --> 44:36.590
how you doing?

44:38.467 --> 44:42.012
Yeah, I will certainly
let him know that you are upset.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.640
Hey, I can't leave my dad alone,
so what's going on?

44:44.723 --> 44:45.933
SHIV: Uh, look.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.267
Upon further reflection,

44:47.351 --> 44:49.478
we have decided
to accept your counter.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.940
-We can eat the jets.
-Okay, uh...

44:53.023 --> 44:54.858
-Any context?
-Uh, no.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.110
We took another look

44:56.193 --> 44:57.903
and thought that this was
the clearest way forward.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.406
And this is what your dad wants?

45:00.489 --> 45:02.866
Yeah, it is what my dad wants.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.576
Well-- well, good. This is good.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.120
SHIV: Great, so, we're good?

45:06.203 --> 45:08.539
We're, you know,
we're going to be good?

45:09.331 --> 45:11.583
Sure, um...

45:11.667 --> 45:14.962
well, honestly, knowing where
my dad is coming from,

45:15.045 --> 45:17.631
I do just wonder
if there will be one more thing.

45:17.714 --> 45:19.216
So, don't turn your phone off.

45:19.299 --> 45:20.384
Okay, come on, look.

45:20.467 --> 45:23.053
Is there something
that we can work out here?

45:23.137 --> 45:24.388
You know, it's now or never.

45:24.471 --> 45:25.973
Well, I-- I-- I don't know.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.226
Sandi, look, I...

45:31.270 --> 45:32.187
I don't think it's right

45:32.271 --> 45:34.440
how your dad sidelines you
in all this.

45:35.774 --> 45:38.485
And maybe it's appropriate

45:38.569 --> 45:41.238
for me to have somebody
like-minded on the board.

45:43.949 --> 45:44.992
So, how about...

45:46.869 --> 45:47.911
a fourth seat...

45:49.037 --> 45:50.080
on the board...

45:50.581 --> 45:51.582
for you.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.128
You can tell him that
you screwed it out of us

45:56.211 --> 45:59.715
and my dad was losing his shit
and it nearly killed him.

45:59.798 --> 46:00.966
-Four seats? That's--
-SHIV: Yeah.

46:01.049 --> 46:02.759
That's a lot of seats.
He will like that.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.386
-Yeah.
-SANDI: Yeah.

46:04.470 --> 46:07.055
Well, it is one more
than three by my count.

46:07.139 --> 46:09.933
So, Waystar, for balance,
will need an extra one.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.603
For me.

46:12.936 --> 46:13.937
I see.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.356
Uh, yeah, he won't love that.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.901
Okay, well, look,
just tell him that...

46:18.984 --> 46:20.611
the fucking,
the markets will never let

46:20.694 --> 46:22.029
me or my brothers be CEO.

46:22.112 --> 46:23.780
SANDI: Oh, come on.
Do you believe that?

46:26.533 --> 46:28.452
I just care
if your dad believes it.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.456
Uh-huh.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.459
Uh, look, I should go.

46:35.542 --> 46:36.543
See if I can sell it.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.754
But this is,
this is good with Logan?

46:38.837 --> 46:39.922
I can sell it.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.757
Can you sell it?

46:50.974 --> 46:53.310
Well, I will relay that.

46:53.393 --> 46:56.605
You are not running again,
and he hopes that we're happy.

46:57.272 --> 46:59.274
-No!
-We need the access!

46:59.358 --> 47:01.318
And I mean,
and that's decided already?

47:01.401 --> 47:02.903
Because, you know, I think that,

47:02.986 --> 47:05.989
uh, whatever our
minor differences,

47:06.073 --> 47:08.951
we would urge you
to not stand aside.

47:10.869 --> 47:12.120
Uh-huh.

47:12.204 --> 47:14.957
Yup, but no. I will be
the messenger boy.
Happy to be that.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.375
I just think-- Yeah.

47:16.458 --> 47:19.753
I just think that our position,
and speaking for my father here,

47:19.836 --> 47:22.214
um, you know, good friends
can be really tough

47:22.297 --> 47:25.008
with their constructive
criticisms, but, um...

47:25.092 --> 47:26.176
we would just say, you know,

47:26.260 --> 47:27.594
and I think that you are

47:27.678 --> 47:30.931
a really significant
historical figure

47:31.014 --> 47:32.432
who has a lot more to give.

47:32.516 --> 47:35.060
Yeah, well, the whole family
at ATN could rally round.

47:35.143 --> 47:38.564
It would be a shame, you know,
sir, to lose you, so...

47:38.647 --> 47:39.606
Absolutely.

47:41.650 --> 47:42.651
Uh-huh.

47:46.863 --> 47:50.200
Well, uh, in that case, uh,
Mr. President,

47:50.284 --> 47:52.786
it has been a privilege
to have the opportunity, yeah.

47:54.162 --> 47:56.748
Best of luck to you, and okay!

47:56.832 --> 47:58.166
All right, so...

47:58.250 --> 47:59.668
Uh, yeah. He just wanted to

47:59.751 --> 48:01.169
let us know that
he's not gonna run again.

48:01.253 --> 48:02.629
-He's pulling out.
-HUGO: Fucking fuck!

48:02.713 --> 48:05.048
Yeah. His minor
neurological issue,

48:05.132 --> 48:07.926
which you know, the media,
starting with us,

48:08.010 --> 48:09.428
have blown way out of proportion

48:09.511 --> 48:12.639
and he doesn't want to put
his wife and kids and family

48:12.723 --> 48:14.182
through all
the blah, blah, blah.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.892
And fuck Dad, and fuck me,

48:15.976 --> 48:18.145
and fuck ATN, and Ravenhead,

48:18.228 --> 48:20.522
and good luck getting the kind
of access that he granted

48:20.606 --> 48:22.107
with whoever
is the next President.

48:22.190 --> 48:24.735
Which, if left up to him,
could be a chicken.

48:24.818 --> 48:26.361
-Fuck!
-ROMAN: Yeah.

48:26.445 --> 48:27.571
Shit.

48:27.654 --> 48:29.948
-Boom-shaka-laka! Hell yeah!
-ROMAN: Fuck yeah, Connor,

48:30.032 --> 48:31.867
I think we just alienated
our most powerful ally.

48:31.950 --> 48:34.453
I mean, it's kind of
nice to know that we can, like,

48:34.536 --> 48:37.789
puppet master the whole
American Republic project
and all, but--

48:37.873 --> 48:39.207
TOM: Oh! Shiv!

48:39.958 --> 48:41.001
Shiv!

48:43.920 --> 48:44.921
Four seats.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.007
-GERRI: What?
-We eat the PJs.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.093
We get a seat. We get a seat.

48:50.177 --> 48:52.429
Yeah, that was
pretty hard to finesse, but...

48:52.512 --> 48:54.848
Sandy and Sandi
are definitely...

48:55.432 --> 48:56.642
in, so...

48:56.725 --> 48:58.935
-Gerri, are we good?
-Four seats?

48:59.019 --> 48:59.978
Oh, fuck!

49:00.062 --> 49:02.189
I would like to say yes to that.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.649
I just-- I--

49:03.732 --> 49:05.275
I think we need to
say yes to that, Gerri!

49:05.359 --> 49:06.485
Can I just-- At some point,

49:06.568 --> 49:08.737
Dad is gonna
walk out of there, so...

49:08.820 --> 49:10.030
TOM: Are we good?

49:10.113 --> 49:11.198
KARL: I-- We--

49:12.783 --> 49:13.825
TOM: Are we good?

49:15.452 --> 49:16.787
Four seats. No PJs.

49:19.581 --> 49:22.334
Uh, we're good. We're good.
Yeah. No vote. Hold the voting.

49:22.417 --> 49:23.543
♪ (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

49:23.627 --> 49:24.795
-Okay, we're good.
-Yes!

49:24.878 --> 49:26.630
They're good.
It's a yes from this end, so...

49:26.713 --> 49:28.382
-Okay.
-TOM: We're good!

49:28.465 --> 49:30.676
Okay, they're good
if we're good! It's done.

49:30.759 --> 49:32.219
-KARL: Great. Great.
-GERRI: Okay, uh...

49:32.302 --> 49:34.513
-Boom!
-So, um,
we need to talk to the lawyers.

49:34.596 --> 49:36.556
They need to plug in the new
details and get signatures

49:36.640 --> 49:38.350
and then we can
talk to the shareholders.

49:38.433 --> 49:40.894
Right, well, Frank, you've done
so much already,

49:40.977 --> 49:42.896
-I would be happy to.
-GERRI: Oh, I see.

49:42.979 --> 49:46.233
Okay, so, we will publish
a press release as Karl--

49:46.316 --> 49:48.777
as Karl--
as he's announcing it. Right.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.237
TOM: Fucking superhero!

49:50.320 --> 49:51.905
(BOTH LAUGH)

49:51.988 --> 49:53.532
The world's on fire!

49:53.615 --> 49:55.826
Thank you! Thanks, honey.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.452
Hey, you wanna get
a hotel room tonight?

49:57.536 --> 49:59.246
-Hotel? I think there's, uh...
-Yeah.

49:59.329 --> 50:03.250
...rooms in the apartment
we've never fully walked into.

50:03.333 --> 50:06.086
I think there's just something
about the way you

50:06.169 --> 50:08.797
smell and the way your body
looks at this time of the mont--

50:08.880 --> 50:11.425
-You know, I'm like a dog.
-What time?

50:11.508 --> 50:12.884
-Time of the?
-I think. I think...

50:12.968 --> 50:15.262
I'm just most horny when you're
the most fertile, you know.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.430
That's how it works, right?

50:16.513 --> 50:17.639
Is this--

50:17.723 --> 50:19.891
Tom, why you asked me
when my period was?

50:19.975 --> 50:21.435
-No!
-(GIGGLES) Are you tracking me?

50:21.518 --> 50:24.146
No, we're like a sorority house.
We're in sync.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.606
I'm just vibing
to your sexy window.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.024
Uh...

50:28.108 --> 50:30.360
Tom, are you
keeping a shadow log?

50:30.444 --> 50:31.695
Watching the phases of the moon

50:31.778 --> 50:33.405
to see when
I'm the most breedable?

50:33.488 --> 50:36.032
No, I just, like,
counted the days on my iCal.

50:36.116 --> 50:37.242
-It's not creepy.
-SHIV: Oh, my God!

50:37.325 --> 50:39.244
It's not creep--
No, it's not, come on.

50:39.327 --> 50:40.454
I've got like...

50:40.537 --> 50:43.248
six more ovulation windows
until all sex is prison sex.

50:43.331 --> 50:44.624
I said I didn't like the timing.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.460
Well, I think the timing's good.
Like, nine to twelve months

50:46.543 --> 50:48.128
is kind of what
I'm hoping I might serve.

50:48.211 --> 50:49.838
I think it's a good slot.

50:49.921 --> 50:51.423
What? Put one in
for when you're out?

50:51.506 --> 50:54.092
No, no! It's--
It would keep you--

50:54.176 --> 50:56.636
-SHIV: What?
-Like, not company, but--

50:56.720 --> 50:58.680
I might need something, Shiv.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.432
Okay? Otherwise,
what is the point of all this?

51:00.515 --> 51:01.641
Where are we heading?

51:01.725 --> 51:03.602
Tom, I don't want to be
your fucking incubator for...

51:03.685 --> 51:04.895
when you're in prison

51:04.978 --> 51:07.439
doing chin-ups
and reading Knausgaard.

51:07.522 --> 51:08.857
You're making it sound horrible.

51:08.940 --> 51:10.692
And it's not horrible.
It's nice.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.486
-SHIV: Oh my God.
-It's supposed to be nice.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.029
SHIV: Fuck.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.868
Yeah, I should be out there.
You know, I'm hiding back here.

51:19.951 --> 51:21.578
It makes me look like
I'm losing,

51:21.661 --> 51:22.954
when actually, I'm winning.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.539
-Your very absence--
-Plus, Stewy says

51:24.623 --> 51:26.625
we have the deal,
so it's safe.

51:26.708 --> 51:29.628
Your very absence
has a certain power.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.380
Uh-huh. I think my absence makes
me look like a little bitch.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.424
We believe this
dynamic action plan

51:34.508 --> 51:37.344
will restore full confidence
in the Waystar brand

51:37.427 --> 51:41.139
for both our consumers
and our employees alike.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.851
We've addressed systemic issues
that affected us historically.

51:44.935 --> 51:47.896
And we vow to do better
moving forward.

51:47.979 --> 51:52.484
Because at Waystar, we've
always cared about women--

51:52.567 --> 51:57.030
Uh, yes, uh, may I just
interrupt for just a moment.

51:57.113 --> 52:00.659
Uh, we are very,
very pleased to report

52:00.742 --> 52:03.411
that a settlement
has been reached

52:03.495 --> 52:06.998
with Maesbury Capital
and Furness Media Groups

52:07.082 --> 52:08.166
-which will--
-(APPLAUSE)

52:08.250 --> 52:12.003
Thank you.
We're all overjoyed.

52:12.087 --> 52:16.800
And Logan, uh, Logan Roy just
desperately wanted to be here

52:16.883 --> 52:20.887
to address his shareholders
at this very important time.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.889
He's a details guy, my friends.

52:22.973 --> 52:25.267
And he's been working
very hard on this.

52:25.350 --> 52:29.145
And he will be, um, connecting
with his shareholders...

52:29.229 --> 52:30.897
-SHIV: Oh, fuck me!
-Oh, my God.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.149
Fucking stop him!
Step on his balls! Stop him!

52:33.233 --> 52:34.609
Don't we have a guy?

52:34.693 --> 52:35.819
-HUGO: Yup. Yup.
-Do we have security?

52:35.902 --> 52:37.863
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sorry, do you mind?

52:37.946 --> 52:39.614
What? What are you doing?

52:39.698 --> 52:42.492
-I'll take it from here.
-No, no, no, no.

52:42.576 --> 52:44.411
-Step aside, please.
-Ken, don't do this.

52:44.494 --> 52:46.705
-Karl Muller, everyone.
-(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

52:46.788 --> 52:48.665
SHIV: We can't--
We can't do anything about this.

52:48.748 --> 52:50.500
-HUGO: Where's Colin?
-We can't manhandle him.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.168
-CONNOR: Colin is with...
-Can't we?

52:52.252 --> 52:54.254
-CONNOR: Colin's with Pop.
-He's with Logan.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.631
You know, I'm not actually...

52:56.715 --> 52:58.800
I'm not actually
scheduled to speak today.

53:00.218 --> 53:01.595
I would like to say this.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.556
I'd like to ask you all

53:04.639 --> 53:06.349
to please join with me...

53:07.100 --> 53:08.768
in a moment of silence...

53:08.852 --> 53:11.938
for all the victims of crimes
that took place on our watch.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.320
Keira Mason.

53:18.403 --> 53:20.238
-SHIV: Oh, my God!
-GERRI: Oh, my God.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.449
-HUGO: Cut his mic.
Make sure his mic is cut.
-He's so annoying.

53:22.532 --> 53:24.117
-KAROLINA:
You're not being silent.
-SHIV: The narcissism of

53:24.200 --> 53:26.411
-this fucking guy!
-You know what?
He looks crazy...

53:26.494 --> 53:29.331
-HUGO: Yes, now.
-...and I think
that can be good for us.

-Kelly Rob--

Kelly Robinson-Kellis.

53:42.218 --> 53:43.803
HUGO: Did-- did they cut--
They, yes, okay.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.806
-Yeah, but I can still hear.
-'Cause he's loud as fuck.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.476
We can still hear him.
Cut all mics, please.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.061
He's not even wearing a tie.

53:53.063 --> 53:57.275
I would just like to announce
that I am launching a foundation

53:57.359 --> 54:00.946
in the name of victims
who suffered sexual abuse

54:01.029 --> 54:03.239
in the hands of
my family's company.

54:04.032 --> 54:05.241
Thank you!

54:05.325 --> 54:08.995
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

54:09.913 --> 54:15.418
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

54:30.976 --> 54:33.144
We should've chopped him down.

54:34.312 --> 54:35.855
GERRI: Yeah, well.

54:35.939 --> 54:37.983
I guess it might've
seemed suspicious.

54:38.066 --> 54:40.276
Kind of like shredding
a human document.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.653
Four seats.

54:41.736 --> 54:42.904
And the Raisin gone.

54:43.989 --> 54:46.408
What if we get
a more aggressive DOJ?

54:47.534 --> 54:48.702
You feeling better?

54:48.785 --> 54:51.663
So, here I was thinking
about European cable,

54:51.746 --> 54:54.249
and then boom, open sesame!

54:54.332 --> 54:55.417
Can you believe it?

54:55.500 --> 54:57.669
-CYD PEACH:
It is hard to believe.
-Yeah.

54:57.752 --> 54:59.379
-Have a good time.
-CONNOR: Thank you.

54:59.462 --> 55:02.173
Yeah, so, I have a little bit
of a development.

55:02.257 --> 55:07.012
Apparently, I can't technically
sue Ewan while he's still alive,

55:07.095 --> 55:09.889
but I can sue Greenpeace.

55:09.973 --> 55:11.850
You're going to sue Greenpeace?

55:13.601 --> 55:15.478
I like your style, Greg.

55:15.562 --> 55:17.188
Who do you think you're
gonna go after next?

55:17.272 --> 55:18.273
Save the Children?

-(GLASS CLINKS)
-FRANK: Sorry, everyone.

55:21.776 --> 55:23.528
Uh...

55:23.611 --> 55:27.198
I think, uh,
every attendee of today's

55:27.282 --> 55:28.908
shareholder meeting can agree

55:28.992 --> 55:31.745
we've heard more than enough
out of me today.

55:31.828 --> 55:35.623
But I just want to say,
well done to all.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.168
Well done to Logan,
well done to Shiv,

55:38.251 --> 55:41.087
on one hell of a Hail Mary.

SHIV: So, congratulations.
You did it.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.388
Uh, I need to see
all the detail.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.973
Oh, Dad, the detail's good.

55:52.057 --> 55:53.308
The seat was the only way.

55:53.391 --> 55:56.603
That's what people on the shitty
end of the deal always say.

55:56.686 --> 55:57.771
Four seats.

55:57.854 --> 56:00.523
But I stipulated that
we need a seat of our own.

56:00.607 --> 56:03.193
And we've talked
about that, right?

56:03.276 --> 56:05.111
Adding another person
to the board. Like me?

56:05.195 --> 56:08.114
Or Connor,
you know, or whoever.

56:09.407 --> 56:11.409
(SCOFFS) We couldn't
risk a vote!

56:12.452 --> 56:13.453
You were...

56:14.913 --> 56:16.247
Dad, you were AWOL.

56:17.957 --> 56:20.126
What would--
What would you have done, then?

56:21.086 --> 56:22.378
LOGAN: Not that.

56:22.462 --> 56:23.922
