<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.375 --> 00:03.458
<i>The new neighbour...</i>

00:03.542 --> 00:05.125
- He's cute.
- He's a bachelor.

00:05.208 --> 00:06.834
<i>...became a hero</i>

00:08.333 --> 00:11.250
<i>in a crisis that brought</i>
<i>Julie and Austin together,</i>

00:11.333 --> 00:13.625
<i>while Carlos and Gabby broke apart.</i>

00:13.709 --> 00:17.083
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you.

00:17.166 --> 00:19.125
And what did I get in return?

00:19.375 --> 00:22.291
<i>The police assembled</i>
<i>their pieces of evidence.</i>

00:22.375 --> 00:24.125
Your phone number was written
on her hand.

00:24.208 --> 00:25.542
I can't help you.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.041
No memory? That's convenient.

00:33.375 --> 00:37.083
<i>Karen McCluskey had always believed</i>
<i>in helping others,</i>

00:37.166 --> 00:40.458
<i>whether they wanted her help or not.</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:44.375
- What's all this?
- You know how you never got around

00:44.458 --> 00:47.709
to painting your garage door?
Well, it's done.

00:48.125 --> 00:49.917
Hope you like blue.

00:52.542 --> 00:56.667
- Baxter. You found him.
- Yeah, and I got him neutered, too.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.291
I figured you wouldn't want
any more strays around here.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.208
- Karen.
- Hi, Alberta.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.208
I took these down for you since,
you know,

01:05.291 --> 01:07.250
Christmas was six months ago.

01:08.792 --> 01:13.709
<i>Yes, Mrs McCluskey's helping hand</i>
<i>was known throughout Wisteria Lane.</i>

01:13.792 --> 01:17.500
<i>But on this day,</i>
<i>it was about to get slapped.</i>

01:17.583 --> 01:19.333
What the hell are you doing?

01:19.417 --> 01:22.709
Jeez, Edie, you scared me.
What are you doing here?

01:22.792 --> 01:23.959
Getting Mike's house ready.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.583
He comes back
from the hospital tomorrow.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.834
Since when do you have a key
to his garage?

01:28.083 --> 01:31.083
He gave me one,
in case of an emergency.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.083
Don't lie to me, prune.

01:33.166 --> 01:36.208
Fine. I found it under his mat.
Look, I'm not doing anything wrong.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.625
I just come over once a week

01:37.709 --> 01:40.291
and start his mower
so the engine doesn't get rusty.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.458
And do you mow your lawn with it, too?

01:42.542 --> 01:44.709
What's the big deal?
I'm doing him a favour.

01:44.792 --> 01:47.291
Well, he doesn't need
any favours from you.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.083
I'm gonna go through Mike's house
room by room,

01:49.166 --> 01:53.041
and if I find as much as one paper clip
missing, I'm calling the cops.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.667
Funny you should talk about
stuff that's missing.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.917
I found those pictures of
Mike and Susan you threw out.

01:59.667 --> 02:02.750
- Pictures?
- Oh, don't act for me.

02:02.834 --> 02:05.333
I know that Mike's been having troubles
with his memory.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.125
My guess,
you don't want him to remember

02:08.208 --> 02:11.041
how crazy he was
about his old girlfriend.

02:11.125 --> 02:14.458
I don't need to resort to deception
to land a man.

02:14.542 --> 02:17.083
Oh, Edie? I saved the pictures.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.959
And I can show them to Mike
any time I like.

02:25.083 --> 02:28.959
<i>Yes, Karen McCluskey believed in</i>
<i>helping others.</i>

02:29.041 --> 02:30.834
Where are you going with this?

02:30.917 --> 02:33.291
<i>Which she felt gave her the right</i>

02:36.333 --> 02:39.125
<i>to help herself.</i>

03:20.500 --> 03:22.125
So, remember to be polite. Smile.

03:22.208 --> 03:25.000
<i>Each year,</i>
<i>as part of their fundraising drive,</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:28.834
<i>the Fairview Adventure Scouts would</i>
<i>award a shiny new bike</i>

03:28.917 --> 03:32.166
<i>to whoever sold</i>
<i>the most magazine subscriptions.</i>

03:32.250 --> 03:34.625
<i>And each Scout would set out,</i>

03:34.709 --> 03:37.792
<i>utterly convinced the prize</i>
<i>would be hers.</i>

03:40.250 --> 03:42.083
<i>That's the beauty of youth.</i>

03:42.166 --> 03:45.166
<i>Little girls believe anything is possible.</i>

03:45.959 --> 03:49.917
<i>That is, until they grow up</i>
<i>and get divorced.</i>

03:50.000 --> 03:54.375
Hi. What if I told you there is a way
you could help children

03:54.458 --> 03:57.834
while also reading your favourite
magazines at a reduced price?

03:57.917 --> 04:01.583
- Would you like to hear more?
- Sure. Knock yourself out.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.417
Wise choice.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.583
For the lady of the house we offer
<i>Redbook, Glamour,</i>

04:07.667 --> 04:10.625
- Vog-you.
- I think you mean <i>Vogue, </i>sweetie.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.875
- You sure?
- I should know. I was on the cover.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.583
No way.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.125
Way.

04:22.500 --> 04:26.208
See that coat I'm wearing in this shot?
That's genuine ocelot fur.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.375
Although the photographer was
the real animal,

04:29.458 --> 04:31.417
if you know what I'm saying.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.542
Which I hope you don't.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.375
And don't ever do drugs, okay?

04:39.458 --> 04:42.166
Being a model must be so amazing.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.041
Why did you stop?

04:44.250 --> 04:48.583
Well, I fell in love, got married
and moved to the suburbs

04:48.667 --> 04:52.417
for the whole fairy-tale
happy-ending thing.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.458
That was a crock.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.917
So you going back to modelling?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.291
No. No, no, no, no, no.

04:59.709 --> 05:02.458
Why not?
What else are you gonna do?

05:06.166 --> 05:08.709
You're going back to modelling?
This is so sudden.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.417
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I'm just gonna fly to New York,

05:11.500 --> 05:14.667
meet with my old agent,
and take it from there.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.750
Come on, you guys.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.250
This is exciting. Be happy for me.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.375
Oh, we are.
We're just gonna miss you, that's all.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.959
Well, now that my divorce is final,

05:25.041 --> 05:27.125
I need a reason to wake up
in the morning.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.709
I have this hole in my life
that can't be filled by shopping.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.583
That's right. I said it.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.250
Oh, my gosh, Lynette.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.417
I'll get the kids.
They're dying to see you.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.291
- Okay. Hey!
- Hey.

05:48.375 --> 05:52.041
Oh, my gosh.
You didn't have to do this!

05:52.125 --> 05:55.041
- Hi.
- You look great.

05:55.125 --> 05:58.542
Well, apparently, taking a .38 slug
to the shoulder agrees with you.

05:58.625 --> 06:02.667
Yeah. Listen, about that,
the kids don't know what happened.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.625
- They don't?
- I thought they were a little young

06:04.709 --> 06:07.750
to deal with their mother getting shot.
All I told them is Kayla is staying

06:07.834 --> 06:11.625
with her grandmother, and I made up
a story about how I got hurt.

06:11.709 --> 06:13.417
- Hey, Mom!
- Here they are.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.083
Hey. Hello. Oh, this side. Hi.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.750
Hello!

06:18.834 --> 06:21.500
Can't believe you got in a fight
with a hobo.

06:22.917 --> 06:26.333
Yeah. Well, let's see how well you do
on a morphine drip.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.583
Mommy, come inside.
We helped Mrs McCluskey

06:28.667 --> 06:30.041
make your favourite lunch.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.458
Fantastic. Lead the way. I'm coming in.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.792
- Hurry up. I'm hungry.
- Let's go. Let's go.

06:34.875 --> 06:38.041
There she is. Hi, bunny, bunny.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.208
Hey. Why don't you go inside
and get the party started?

06:44.291 --> 06:45.834
I've gotta... Okay?

06:45.917 --> 06:47.959
Hi, bunny. I'll be right there.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.625
- Hey.
- Hey!

06:54.709 --> 06:56.792
Lynette, you're home.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.125
- Yeah.
- How are you doing?

06:59.208 --> 07:01.458
I'm good. I just...

07:04.083 --> 07:08.583
How do I thank the man
who saved my life?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.917
No, no, no.
You don't have to say anything.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.625
I'm gonna make you a cake.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.000
- A cake?
- Yeah.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.500
I never make cakes. This is huge.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.417
In that case, thanks.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.417
Yeah, I'm gonna make you a cake!

07:39.959 --> 07:42.041
Christmas carols?
It's not even Thanksgiving.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.083
I'm starting my cards early this year.

07:44.166 --> 07:46.625
It puts me in the mood
to spread holiday cheer.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.667
With the pack of lies
in this family newsletter,

07:48.750 --> 07:51.667
- she spreads holiday denial.
- Andrew, it's etiquette.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.917
Nobody wants to read
the truth at Christmas.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.625
- Well said, darling.
- Honey, would you put on another CD?

07:56.709 --> 07:59.291
Something with sleigh bells.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.625
Oh, by the way, Orson,

08:00.709 --> 08:04.041
I need your mother's address
at the nursing home.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.959
Oh. Well, I appreciate
the thought, darling,

08:07.041 --> 08:08.625
but you needn't send her a card.

08:08.709 --> 08:11.667
Well, don't be silly. I'm sending one
to the man who reads our gas metre.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.166
I can certainly send one to your mother.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.041
She's completely senile.
She'll only try to dunk it in her coffee.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.000
Well, all the more reason
to send her one.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.458
Let the nurses know that she has
family at home who loves her,

08:21.542 --> 08:26.166
and who could drop by at any minute
and slap them with a lawsuit.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.709
Bree, I hear what you're saying.

08:27.792 --> 08:31.083
Orson, what's the big deal?
It's just an address.

08:32.417 --> 08:34.834
Fine. I'll get my book.

08:34.917 --> 08:37.583
The home is somewhere over
in Lakeview.

08:37.667 --> 08:41.083
Lakeview? You gave me
the impression that she was back east.

08:41.166 --> 08:44.250
Well, that's because, frankly,
I wanted to avoid this conversation.

08:44.333 --> 08:48.291
But if she's only 30 minutes away,
why haven't you been visiting her?

08:48.375 --> 08:52.417
Okay, the truth is,
it breaks my heart to see her now.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.083
I want to remember her as she was.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.458
- But, Orson...
- Bree!

08:56.542 --> 09:00.375
I refuse to sit in a room that smells
of disinfectant and lime Jell-O

09:00.458 --> 09:02.792
making small talk with a woman
who doesn't remember me.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.917
Now let it go, damn it.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.458
But, by all means, do send a card.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.083
Elves will tickle her.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.625
- Well, shall we?
- Wait.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.500
Julie's gonna know
we came home early

09:29.583 --> 09:30.875
from the restaurant to check up on her.

09:30.959 --> 09:33.208
I don't want her to think
I'm overprotective and clingy.

09:33.291 --> 09:34.500
The girl was held hostage.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.792
It's only natural you're gonna be
a little bit clingy.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.792
Yeah, it's been a week.
I'm getting on her nerves.

09:39.875 --> 09:43.208
How about this? We came home early
because we hated the restaurant.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.500
The service was dreadful
and the lobster was inedible.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.125
Okay.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.917
Wait. If we hated the restaurant,
then why are we bringing home food?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.333
Good point.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.333
No, no, wait, wait! Are you kidding?

09:59.417 --> 10:03.750
That's lobster. Okay.
I thought the restaurant was fantastic.

10:04.959 --> 10:08.583
You were the fussy snob
who was impossible to please.

10:08.667 --> 10:11.208
Why do I have to be the fussy snob?

10:11.291 --> 10:13.750
- Because you're British.
- Fine.

10:13.834 --> 10:16.458
But I trust you'll make it up to me later
by doing the things

10:16.542 --> 10:19.875
a gentleman expects
when he's sprung for lobster.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.792
I'm not getting any tonight, am I?

10:39.417 --> 10:41.750
- You're supposed to be having dinner.
- It's my fault.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.542
I found the restaurant
to be absolutely...

10:43.625 --> 10:46.625
Oh, let it go. We came home
because I was worried about you.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.166
And with good reason!

10:48.250 --> 10:52.750
- You put on your shirt and get out!
- But I didn't bring a shirt.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.583
- See, I was out running...
- Who cares? Go!

10:59.291 --> 11:00.458
How could you treat him like that?

11:00.542 --> 11:02.834
If Austin hadn't been in
that supermarket, I might not be here.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.000
Yes, and I am grateful,

11:04.083 --> 11:06.834
but I found a way to say thank you
without taking my top off.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.875
A couple of buttons came undone.
It's not like my boobs were out.

11:09.959 --> 11:12.959
Okay, well, it's getting late,
and I really...

11:13.041 --> 11:15.500
No, Ian, am I overreacting here?

11:15.583 --> 11:17.417
Well, I can understand,
on the heels of a crisis,

11:17.500 --> 11:20.583
two people might bond
and find themselves...

11:20.875 --> 11:23.667
- You're a very naughty girl!
- Julie.

11:23.750 --> 11:27.417
That boy drinks, he steals, and now
I find him mauling you on my couch.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.291
That's it. I forbid you to see him.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.375
You can't do that. I choose who I date.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.375
Yeah? Well, I choose to ground you.
Two weeks, baby.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.834
Fine, I'll just see him at school.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.875
Well, then you won't go to school.
I'll home school you.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.041
Right. You're gonna teach me trig?

11:39.125 --> 11:40.250
You can't even balance
your own chequebook.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.000
Yes, and you'll be poorly educated,

11:42.083 --> 11:44.417
and you won't get into college,
and you will work for minimum wage

11:44.500 --> 11:46.667
for the rest of your life,
all because of that boy!

11:46.709 --> 11:48.709
I hope you're happy!

11:48.792 --> 11:51.291
Mom, I like this guy.

11:51.375 --> 11:55.417
And I'm sorry if it makes you unhappy,
but I'm going to keep seeing him.

12:07.875 --> 12:12.166
Doesn't the place look great?
I came in and straightened up.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.750
I wanted everything
to look nice for you.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.166
Are you okay?

12:20.583 --> 12:21.667
Yeah.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.333
Yeah, it's just that...

12:23.417 --> 12:27.208
I'm home,
but it doesn't really feel like home.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.458
It will. Give it time.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.291
The important thing is that you're back
from the hospital,

12:34.375 --> 12:36.792
and every day you're getting better.

12:36.875 --> 12:40.083
Hey, the worst is behind you.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.250
I need the Delfino search warrant.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.333
We're not gonna get it
without probable cause.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.583
The guy's phone number was written
on a dead girl's hand.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.917
- The judge is gonna need more.
- I thought you might say that.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.542
Here's Monique Polier's lab work.

12:57.625 --> 13:01.208
The infrared spectroscopy matched
paint fragments in the head wound

13:01.291 --> 13:03.250
to the proximal line of pipe wrenches.

13:03.333 --> 13:07.291
They're high-end,
only used by professional plumbers.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.792
And guess what our boy Delfino
does for a living?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.291
I'll see what I can do.

13:16.709 --> 13:18.125
What do you mean
you can't shoot her?

13:18.208 --> 13:20.375
Francesco,
if you can airbrush her acne,

13:20.458 --> 13:22.333
you can airbrush the track marks.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.000
Now, don't call me again
unless she OD's.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.709
- Sit.
- You look amazing.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.583
- Younger than ever.
- It's my new dermal filler.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.291
It's banned here, so my assistant
smuggles it in from Brazil.

13:37.375 --> 13:40.709
Isn't it fun? I have my own drug mule.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.750
That's great.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.417
Well, I have some fun news of my own.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.542
- I'm ready to model again.
- Really?

13:48.625 --> 13:51.291
The last time we spoke
you couldn't wait to quit.

13:51.375 --> 13:55.333
You were giving it all up for love.
What happened to Prince Charming?

13:56.709 --> 14:00.125
- Divorce.
- Oh, single again.

14:00.208 --> 14:04.917
Isn't that ironic, since I'm the one
you called... Oh, how did you put it?

14:05.291 --> 14:10.709
"A career-obsessed lesbo who would
die alone and be eaten by her cats."

14:10.792 --> 14:13.500
- Did I say that?
- Water under the bridge.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.792
I thought it was funny.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.041
It's even funnier now.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.709
Look, Marcella, I'm back,

14:20.792 --> 14:22.625
and we made such a great team before,

14:22.709 --> 14:24.417
and I think we can be again.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.709
I don't know, darling.
Things are different now.

14:26.792 --> 14:29.667
You're not gonna be able to jump
right back in where you left off.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.625
Well, I just want to work.

14:31.709 --> 14:34.333
Boy, I'm still not sure.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.166
You know what might help?

14:36.834 --> 14:40.875
- If you grovelled.
- Are you serious?

14:42.667 --> 14:45.500
Well, I can't tell, because your face
doesn't move any more.

14:45.583 --> 14:49.125
No, I'm joking. Welcome back, darling.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.125
Hi.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.625
Thank you.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.625
Well, hello, there.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.917
How pretty you look today.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.750
It's wonderful that you're up and about.

15:13.834 --> 15:17.750
You must be enjoying
these colourful balloons.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.959
Why are you talking to me
like I'm a moron?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.458
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:27.542 --> 15:30.917
The nurse pointed me over here.
I'm looking for Gloria Hodge.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.041
I'm Gloria Hodge.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.083
Who might you be?

15:38.792 --> 15:41.875
I must say,
I'm surprised at how lucid you are.

15:41.959 --> 15:43.250
Orson led me to believe...

15:43.333 --> 15:45.291
That I was
in the final stages of dementia.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.917
No, I'm afraid that's
just wishful thinking on his part.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.333
Well, how can he feel that way?
You're his mother.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.375
I wouldn't judge him too harshly.

15:53.458 --> 15:57.750
Ours is a complicated relationship.

15:57.834 --> 16:02.500
There is love, to be sure, but we have
a way of disappointing each other.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.959
Well, how does he disappoint you?

16:06.041 --> 16:08.792
He's cold, rigid,

16:09.291 --> 16:13.834
and utterly incapable of
letting go of the past.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.834
And how do you disappoint him?

16:16.917 --> 16:18.834
I refuse to die.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.917
Yes, I see.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.083
Well, surely this rift isn't irreparable.

16:26.959 --> 16:31.166
Do you know how people in
nursing homes spend their days, Bree?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.792
They think about the past.

16:33.875 --> 16:38.250
And all the things they'd do differently,
if they had the chance.

16:38.667 --> 16:41.458
Please tell Orson that I'm sorry.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.667
And in spite of everything,
I still love him.

16:47.208 --> 16:50.834
I have a better idea.
Why don't you tell him yourself?

16:57.500 --> 17:00.500
That would be great.
I really appreciate it.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.875
Okay. Thank you.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.834
So what did Ed say?
When do you have to go back to work?

17:05.917 --> 17:08.125
He said take as much time as I want
with pay.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.417
How was your day?

17:09.500 --> 17:12.041
You should get gunned down
more often.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.750
- Hey, there they are.
- Hey, guys.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.959
- Hello.
- How was school? Doing well?

17:19.041 --> 17:21.000
Mommy, were you shot?

17:21.500 --> 17:24.208
Shot? Where did you hear that?

17:24.291 --> 17:26.709
Jordan Blackwelder.

17:26.792 --> 17:29.667
That's the same little creep
who tried to ruin Santa Claus.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.500
And he said that the same crazy lady
that shot you

17:32.583 --> 17:36.208
killed Auntie Nora dead.
It was on the news and everything.

17:36.417 --> 17:40.125
Okay, listen, kids. I am sorry.
We shouldn't have lied,

17:40.208 --> 17:43.583
but sometimes parents want to protect
kids from scary things.

17:43.667 --> 17:47.250
And, look, the good news is,
Mommy's fine now.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.166
And we'll all see Auntie Nora
again in heaven.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.709
Or wherever.

17:54.792 --> 17:58.041
- Did they let you keep the bullet?
- No. I'm afraid not.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.583
That blows.
We wanted to bring it for show and tell.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.125
Hey, sweetheart, you okay?

18:09.208 --> 18:11.834
What if the crazy lady comes back?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.417
She won't.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.458
- How do you know?
- Well,

18:19.542 --> 18:24.083
because she's up in heaven
with Auntie Nora.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.667
Or wherever.

18:35.792 --> 18:38.583
Julie Mayer, you get back here!

18:38.667 --> 18:41.125
You're grounded, remember?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.834
Edie Britt, I want to talk to you.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.375
I just survived a hostage situation.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.208
Haven't I suffered enough
for one week?

18:55.291 --> 18:58.291
You keep your nephew
away from my daughter or else.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.208
Look, I don't like it, either,

19:00.291 --> 19:02.125
but the harder we try
to keep them apart

19:02.208 --> 19:04.417
the more they're gonna
fight to be together.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.291
- Just let it run its course.
- Are you crazy?

19:08.375 --> 19:11.875
If we don't do something,
those two could end up having sex!

19:11.959 --> 19:14.375
- Could?
- Oh, my God.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.583
- You don't...
- Let me put it this way.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.208
I've got a box of condoms
in my dresser.

19:20.291 --> 19:23.917
Eleven are gone.
I can only account for eight of them.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.375
How can you be so calm about this?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.333
- Edie?
- Yeah.

19:29.417 --> 19:31.792
Can you help me with this tie?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.375
- Hey.
- Mike.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.500
- You're out of the hospital.
- Yeah.

19:41.583 --> 19:45.458
He's home. In fact, we're gonna go out
and celebrate tonight.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.625
I'll be with you in one sec, okay, babe?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.250
Since you asked,

19:55.333 --> 19:58.667
I'm calm because I know if two people
are meant to be together,

19:58.750 --> 20:01.542
there's nothing anyone can do about it.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.375
Okay. I should be back at around 6:00.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.834
They can have one snack.
Try and push apples.

20:11.917 --> 20:15.750
But if they threaten violence, I have an
emergency candy bar under the sink.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.500
- Not any more, you don't.
- Oh, jeez.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.125
Mommy, where are you going?

20:22.208 --> 20:24.125
- To the market.
- No.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.500
Hey, sweetie, it's a different market.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.583
- You're gonna get shot again.
- No, I won't.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.667
Lots of mommies go to the store
every day and they're fine.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.250
It's really not a scary place.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.500
You went to the store,
and you got shot,

20:36.583 --> 20:38.667
and Auntie Nora died.

20:43.083 --> 20:46.125
I'm only gonna be in there 10 minutes.
I promise.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.291
Can't she go?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.125
Fine, I'll go.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.625
Thanks.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.625
You don't give a hoot if I get shot,
do you, kid?

21:14.291 --> 21:16.625
You must be Tanya. I'm Gabrielle.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.166
We're gonna be co-models today.

21:20.166 --> 21:24.208
Now, I don't know if you've ever done
one of these big shoots before,

21:24.291 --> 21:27.500
but don't be nervous.
Durkin and I are old friends.

21:27.583 --> 21:31.208
He's a sweetheart.
Now, just remember, he's the king.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.333
Do exactly what he says
and you'll be fine.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.166
I've been modelling for two years.

21:38.250 --> 21:42.375
I've done six magazine covers,
and I'm sleeping with Durkin.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.875
I guess you're all set, then.

21:47.709 --> 21:50.542
You've got some wardrobe choices.

21:51.417 --> 21:54.625
Hey. Wow!

21:56.667 --> 21:59.291
I want to be buried in this dress.

21:59.375 --> 22:02.959
This is for Tanya.
The mom's stuff is at the end.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.041
Mom?

22:07.583 --> 22:10.250
Okay, love,
let's get the blood pumping!

22:10.333 --> 22:12.458
The concept is
"lock up your daughters."

22:12.542 --> 22:14.959
Okay, get to work, everybody.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.083
Tanya, I want you to hover down here
on the lawn,

22:18.166 --> 22:21.166
looking absolutely delicious.
Thank you very much.

22:21.250 --> 22:25.291
And up here on the porch,
Mom and Dad looking all scandalised.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.875
- Excuse me, Durkin?
- Yes, love?

22:27.959 --> 22:29.875
It's Gabby.

22:31.458 --> 22:34.875
Gabrielle Marquez.
You shot me in Milan, remember?

22:35.208 --> 22:39.792
Yes. Yes! Lovely to see you again.
Did you have a question, then?

22:39.875 --> 22:41.458
I do.

22:43.041 --> 22:46.333
Aren't you a little worried
that I'm gonna pull focus?

22:46.417 --> 22:48.166
I mean, it's a little confusing.

22:48.250 --> 22:52.667
People are gonna see Tanya,
then they're gonna see that guy,

22:52.750 --> 22:55.375
and they're gonna wonder who I am.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.792
You're the mom.

22:59.542 --> 23:02.000
People aren't gonna buy that.
So, here's what I was thinking.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.000
I slap on one of those gowns.

23:04.083 --> 23:09.959
I play Tanya's big sister,
home from college to raise a little hell.

23:10.041 --> 23:13.417
And we're gonna cram
all that on a subtitle, are we?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.125
I'm sorry.
It's just this outfit is hideous.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.041
Just make it work.

23:19.583 --> 23:22.917
Fine. I just need a moment
to get into character.

23:27.417 --> 23:31.333
Gabrielle, what's the hold-up?
We've got to get moving here.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.125
Ready, ready.

23:35.959 --> 23:38.667
- What's that?
- Oh, I made it work.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.208
I'm hot mom.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.458
Get me her agent.

23:50.834 --> 23:52.583
Before we begin, would either of you

23:52.667 --> 23:55.709
like some cookies, milk,
lemonade, perhaps?

23:55.834 --> 23:57.959
Mom, why are we here?

23:58.041 --> 24:01.166
Cutting to the chase. I like it.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.291
I have a confession to make.

24:07.375 --> 24:10.000
This whole dating drama has been
keeping me up at night,

24:10.083 --> 24:12.750
and I hate being
the bitchy, naggy mom.

24:12.834 --> 24:16.542
When it comes to parenting, I am much
more comfortable playing the good cop.

24:16.625 --> 24:19.583
Do you see
where I'm going with this, kids?

24:19.667 --> 24:20.750
No.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.750
Oh. Well, in that case,

24:23.625 --> 24:25.583
meet the bad cop.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.875
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby girl.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.625
- Is that the guy?
- Yep.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.291
Get him.

24:40.542 --> 24:41.917
This is so unfair.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.208
Look, you defied my wishes,
you broke my rules.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.583
Did you really think I was just gonna
throw in the towel?

24:46.667 --> 24:48.917
Face it. I outsmarted you.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.166
- Who's Ian?
- What?

24:59.250 --> 25:01.917
You're dating some British guy
named Ian.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.417
How did that come up?

25:03.500 --> 25:06.083
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise it was a big secret.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.166
You know, when you said it was
true love with you and the plumber,

25:10.250 --> 25:14.125
I was a good guy. I stepped aside.
And now you're on to someone else.

25:14.208 --> 25:17.625
Big picture, Karl.
His hand up our daughter's shirt.

25:17.709 --> 25:20.709
- Don't change the subject.
- That is the subject.

25:20.792 --> 25:25.500
- How serious is it with this Ian guy?
- I don't know. It's complicated.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.792
Yeah, he's kind of married.

25:28.709 --> 25:31.542
- He's what?
- It's not what you think.

25:31.959 --> 25:34.792
In her defence, his wife is in a coma.

25:35.875 --> 25:39.041
All right, that's it.
All right, I forbid you to see this guy.

25:39.125 --> 25:42.583
What? No. I don't take orders from you.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.583
Mom has a point, Dad. You can't tell
a woman who she can and can't date.

25:45.667 --> 25:48.375
- It's her choice.
- Exactly. Thank you. Wait, no.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.166
That does not apply to you.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.500
You know,
if you don't care about my feelings,

25:52.583 --> 25:55.667
- I don't know what I'm doing here.
- Your feelings? My God.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.208
You are the worst bad cop ever.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.083
Go to your room.

26:05.583 --> 26:07.083
Not you.

26:12.625 --> 26:16.041
- Get back, you're under arrest.
- No, I'm not.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.083
Hey, buddy, you've been reading
comic books for a while.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.542
Don't you want to go and play?

26:21.667 --> 26:25.083
- No. I want to stay with you.
- Yeah?

26:25.834 --> 26:27.041
Okay.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.500
Hey, Art.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.583
- Oh, hey. How are you?
- Good.

26:41.667 --> 26:46.667
Listen, as if saving my life wasn't
enough, I have a little favour to ask.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.417
- Sure. What's up?
- My kids are having a hard time.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.417
They're pretty freaked out
by that whole supermarket thing.

26:52.500 --> 26:56.208
You're my hostage.
Keep moving or I'll blow your face off.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.750
Okay, it's my turn. Give me the gun.

26:57.834 --> 27:00.375
- It's not so much them.
- Right.

27:00.458 --> 27:03.750
But my other son, Parker.

27:03.875 --> 27:06.834
So, back to the favour.

27:10.083 --> 27:11.917
Hey, Parker.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.208
I want you to meet
our new neighbour, Art.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.709
He lives in the house across the street.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.709
His sister has the cool wheelchair
with the joy stick.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.500
- Hey, there, Parker.
- Hi.

27:25.750 --> 27:29.792
In the daytime, Art coaches swimming
at the rec centre.

27:29.875 --> 27:33.959
But... Please, can I tell Parker?
Please?

27:34.041 --> 27:38.166
And compromise my secret identity?
No way, Mrs Scavo. No way.

27:39.500 --> 27:43.542
- Secret identity?
- Oh, great.

27:43.625 --> 27:46.750
Now the cat's out of the bag.
Might as well tell him.

27:46.834 --> 27:50.458
It's okay. You can trust him, really.

27:50.542 --> 27:54.500
Art is the one who saved me
at the supermarket.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.917
He's sort of a superhero.

28:00.709 --> 28:02.417
Give me a break.

28:04.458 --> 28:06.208
It's true.

28:08.125 --> 28:11.875
All right. If you're a superhero,
what's your name?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.792
I'm...

28:14.583 --> 28:16.458
Protector Man.

28:16.542 --> 28:19.333
Because I protect people
from bad guys.

28:23.917 --> 28:26.208
You don't believe me, do you?

28:27.417 --> 28:28.875
Okay.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.083
I really shouldn't do this, but...

28:34.250 --> 28:37.709
Wow. Did you really save my mom?

28:38.917 --> 28:40.667
I really did.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.375
He really did.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.917
That's why you don't have to worry.
That's Protector Man's job.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.500
Your job is to run and play
and have fun.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.208
Okay?

28:56.333 --> 28:57.667
Okay.

28:58.417 --> 28:59.583
Okay.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.709
My cousin went to Purdue.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.458
What the hell?

29:24.750 --> 29:26.125
Delfino.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.125
Nice to see you up and about.

29:30.333 --> 29:34.333
- Here's our search warrant.
- Search warrant? Let me see that.

29:39.458 --> 29:40.792
How are we doing?

29:40.875 --> 29:43.041
We couldn't find a toolbox.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.875
The man's a plumber. Keep looking.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.625
- Sir, I can't find a thing.
- You tired?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.625
Well, let's go. Let's get it back to one.

29:56.583 --> 29:59.208
- You come with me.
- Marcella!

30:00.542 --> 30:01.750
I don't know what they told you,

30:01.834 --> 30:03.417
but all I'm asking for is
a simple costume change.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.250
You don't get to pull diva crap.

30:05.333 --> 30:09.166
Tanya gets away with it,
because she's a star. You are nothing.

30:09.250 --> 30:10.834
Where do you get off talking to me
like that?

30:10.917 --> 30:13.583
I shot 36 covers by the time I was 20.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.542
Well, you're 30 now.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.542
When you make that face you look 35.

30:20.291 --> 30:22.625
Do you know how many photographers
would die to work with me again?

30:22.709 --> 30:24.208
Yeah. Zero.

30:24.291 --> 30:26.709
I had to call in major favours
just to get you this job.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.458
- I don't believe that.
- You know what I don't believe?

30:29.542 --> 30:32.750
You gave up a brilliant career
to play house in the suburbs,

30:32.834 --> 30:34.375
and the minute it falls apart
you come back here

30:34.458 --> 30:36.125
expecting a homecoming parade.

30:36.208 --> 30:39.166
Well, guess what, sweetie.
We've moved on.

30:40.125 --> 30:45.333
Now, get your polyester ass over there
and act like the pro you used to be.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.500
Beautiful, Tanya. That's it, chin up.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.750
Fantastic.
Mother, hold the plate higher.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.834
Beautiful, Tanya.
Oh, you are gorgeous!

31:03.917 --> 31:06.083
Yes, girl. Lovely, lovely!

31:08.792 --> 31:11.208
Hiya, Mike. Welcome home.
You remember me?

31:11.291 --> 31:13.250
Yeah, I think so.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.917
The corner house
with all the gnomes out front?

31:16.000 --> 31:18.750
You're thinking of Martha Huber.
Terrible story.

31:18.834 --> 31:22.041
Someone beat her to death
and then buried her in the forest.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.750
Ironic, huh?
Isn't that where gnomes live?

31:25.291 --> 31:27.959
I don't really know that much
about gnomes.

31:28.041 --> 31:31.000
Anyway, I know the cops
were here earlier.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.250
So?

31:32.333 --> 31:35.291
You won't remember this,
but one night, two years ago,

31:35.375 --> 31:38.750
you drove me to the hospital
after I had an attack of angina.

31:38.834 --> 31:40.834
Probably saved my life.

31:40.917 --> 31:43.792
Anyway, I figure I owe you. Here.

31:44.208 --> 31:46.625
You might want to wash
that wrench off.

31:46.709 --> 31:49.125
It's got something on it.

31:54.542 --> 31:58.083
Sorry I'm late.
Mrs Prescott broke a crown and...

32:00.208 --> 32:02.417
Orson, how well you look.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.041
Hello, Mother.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.500
A word, darling.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.333
I can't believe you did this!

32:16.417 --> 32:19.875
And I can't believe you told me
that she was senile! You lied to me.

32:19.959 --> 32:22.291
Yes, to spare us
the misery of her company.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.917
You don't know her, Bree.
She's a loathsome woman,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.166
- and I refuse to break bread with her.
- Now, you listen to me.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.583
That woman gave you life,

32:29.667 --> 32:31.709
and the fifth commandment tells us
to honour our parents,

32:31.792 --> 32:34.500
no matter how hideous or repellent
they may be.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.625
- That's not exactly...
- Orson, it's implied!

32:37.709 --> 32:40.417
Now, get out there
and show her some respect.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.917
Fine, but if you expect anything more
from me than forced civility,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.333
you will be deeply disappointed.

32:51.417 --> 32:54.625
- Bree, the salmon is superb.
- Well, thank you.

32:54.709 --> 32:57.709
It did win me the blue ribbon
at the Gourmet County Cook-off.

32:57.792 --> 33:01.000
I just love the sauce.
What gives it that kick?

33:01.583 --> 33:05.000
You'd never ask a magician
how a trick is done.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.041
You've barely touched
your salmon, dear.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.667
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

33:13.875 --> 33:16.625
I was just wondering why you're here.

33:17.875 --> 33:20.583
- I want us to be friends.
- Okay.

33:21.250 --> 33:24.583
Let's suppose I just had
a massive head injury and believe you.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.166
We're pals. Now, what do you want?

33:26.250 --> 33:30.166
Orson, why does she have to have
an ulterior motive?

33:32.709 --> 33:35.875
- I want out of that home.
- There it is.

33:35.959 --> 33:39.208
It's a hellhole.
Besides, I'm perfectly healthy now.

33:39.291 --> 33:41.500
My hip is better. I can handle the stairs.

33:41.583 --> 33:45.625
And you said when I got strong enough
I'd get to go back to my house.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.500
Oh, here's the thing.

33:47.583 --> 33:50.917
- I sold it.
- What?

33:52.333 --> 33:53.667
You heard me.

33:54.834 --> 33:59.500
- What about my things?
- All gone. Oh, I also sold the car.

33:59.583 --> 34:03.208
See, that's the thing about hellholes.
They don't pay for themselves.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.375
How dare you? You had no right!

34:06.959 --> 34:09.875
Okay, maybe I will share
my secret ingredient.

34:09.959 --> 34:13.875
I should have smothered you
in your crib when I had the chance.

34:13.959 --> 34:16.208
Paprika! There, it's out.

34:16.709 --> 34:19.125
That's the mother I remember.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.792
I was wondering when she'd show up.

34:22.291 --> 34:25.375
Yes, Orson, I am your mother.

34:25.458 --> 34:29.625
So you more than anyone should know
how I deal with betrayal.

34:37.333 --> 34:40.625
So, can we call her Grandma?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.583
I've got one more load,
and then I'm gonna do my homework.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.542
Do you have anything you want me
to throw in?

34:56.625 --> 34:58.625
No, I'm good, thanks.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.709
Mom, listen.

35:06.291 --> 35:10.333
I know I've put you through
the wringer lately, and I'm sorry.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.792
Sixteen years of being perfect.
You were due.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.917
That's what I don't get.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.583
You've always trusted my judgement.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.709
Why can't you trust me about Austin?

35:25.166 --> 35:28.667
Relationships have nothing to do
with good judgement.

35:28.750 --> 35:32.750
It doesn't matter how smart you are.
You can still get hurt.

35:35.291 --> 35:38.333
You do your homework.
I'm gonna finish the laundry.

35:38.417 --> 35:39.875
Okay.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.000
There you go, Mrs H.

35:59.208 --> 36:00.583
All right.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.542
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Come on in.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.000
Thank you.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.250
Please stay for dessert.

36:10.333 --> 36:13.000
I'll work on Orson
and we'll discuss this together.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.041
You saw what he sentenced me to,

36:15.125 --> 36:17.917
a room no better
than a furnished coffin.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.166
- I have nothing to say to him.
- Well, then talk to me.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.834
I know you're upset,
but don't shut me out, please.

36:24.917 --> 36:28.000
Please, Gloria, let me in.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.458
Well, I didn't mean it literally,
but okay.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.500
We'll sit together and we'll talk.
What are you doing?

36:37.583 --> 36:40.000
I'm not going back to that place!

36:40.083 --> 36:41.625
Gloria, stop!

36:42.792 --> 36:44.625
Let's get my mother back to the home,
shall we?

36:44.709 --> 36:49.166
Yeah, not that it's any of my business,
but is everything okay with you folks?

36:49.250 --> 36:53.166
Yeah. There was a little tension earlier,
but I think it's all been resolved.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.041
What the hell?

37:07.166 --> 37:09.083
No. I absolutely forbid it.

37:09.166 --> 37:13.000
Just for a few weeks till we find
a place where she'll be happier.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.750
You should have heard her in the car.

37:14.834 --> 37:17.417
She's absolutely miserable
in that nursing home.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.000
I don't care.
My mother's not moving in here

37:20.083 --> 37:21.875
till she fits in a jar on the mantle.

37:21.959 --> 37:24.041
How can you be so cold?

37:24.458 --> 37:26.625
You don't know who she is.

37:26.709 --> 37:29.625
I've worked my entire life to get away
from that woman.

37:29.709 --> 37:34.083
Why? What could she possibly have
done to make you hate her so much?

37:35.583 --> 37:38.917
Look, there is nothing to be gained
by dredging up the past.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.208
Orson, if there's something
I should know...

37:43.250 --> 37:45.792
Could I speak to my son a moment?

37:49.041 --> 37:50.542
Of course.

37:55.250 --> 38:00.000
So you know, I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.

38:01.917 --> 38:05.041
- I won't allow it.
- Oh, I think you will.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.625
We're going to end our quarrel
right now.

38:08.375 --> 38:11.458
Or I'll tell your wife what it's about.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.500
- You wouldn't.
- Just try me.

38:15.917 --> 38:17.709
I gave you life.

38:18.458 --> 38:21.500
You know I won't hesitate
to take it away.

38:30.083 --> 38:32.250
Now, give Mother a kiss.

38:33.083 --> 38:35.959
Why in the hell would I want to do that?

38:36.041 --> 38:38.458
To make it look real.

38:59.208 --> 39:01.000
Hey! You're back!

39:01.291 --> 39:03.166
I'd give you a hug,
but I'm really sweaty.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.333
- So how was New York?
- Oh, it was fine.

39:05.417 --> 39:07.875
Bree said you got a job on the first day.
You're such a star.

39:07.959 --> 39:09.625
I want details.

39:10.333 --> 39:14.291
You know, just hours and hours
of sitting around looking pretty.

39:14.375 --> 39:17.000
But I think I'm done with modelling.

39:17.083 --> 39:18.583
So you're not gonna move
to New York?

39:18.667 --> 39:21.792
Well, if something great comes up,
I might fly out,

39:21.875 --> 39:24.166
but I'm pretty settled here.

39:24.250 --> 39:27.208
Thank God. We were all so worried
we were losing you.

39:27.291 --> 39:29.542
Okay. Now I'm hugging you.

39:32.375 --> 39:35.208
It's amazing.
Your life is such an adventure.

39:35.291 --> 39:38.083
I can't wait to see what you do next.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.250
Yeah. Me, too.

39:47.041 --> 39:48.250
Okay.

39:55.834 --> 39:58.583
- Mr Protector Man?
- That's a secret.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.333
Hello?

40:00.875 --> 40:02.291
Hello?

40:06.834 --> 40:08.875
Sweet!

40:11.750 --> 40:13.125
Mom, look.

40:13.208 --> 40:16.375
Hey, don't touch anything.
I'm just gonna write a note,

40:16.959 --> 40:20.458
and then we'll go. Okay.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.500
Parker?

40:24.583 --> 40:27.166
Hey, come back here.

40:28.875 --> 40:31.208
Honey? Come on, we're leaving.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.041
Parker!

40:35.166 --> 40:37.583
Parker, come on, we're leaving.

40:37.875 --> 40:40.542
Why didn't you come when I called?

40:45.792 --> 40:48.000
Superhero houses are great!

41:24.250 --> 41:26.875
Parker, come on.
We're gonna get out of here.

41:26.959 --> 41:29.667
- Why?
- I just said so. Come on.

41:35.208 --> 41:39.375
<i>There are so many things</i>
<i>we wish we could tell the young.</i>

41:41.333 --> 41:45.125
<i>We'd like to persuade them</i>
<i>not to grow up so fast.</i>

41:46.583 --> 41:48.542
<i>But they won't listen.</i>

41:49.625 --> 41:52.583
<i>We want to tell them</i>
<i>that beauty fades.</i>

41:52.667 --> 41:54.709
Let's see the look.
Let's see the look, darling.

41:54.792 --> 41:56.834
<i>But they refuse to believe it.</i>

41:58.792 --> 42:02.542
<i>We warn them that their actions</i>
<i>will have consequences.</i>

42:04.500 --> 42:06.834
<i>But still they defy us.</i>

42:08.166 --> 42:11.208
<i>Sadly, the young can't begin</i>
<i>to understand</i>

42:11.291 --> 42:13.625
<i>the world is a dangerous place.</i>

42:14.625 --> 42:19.125
<i>So it's up to us to do anything we can</i>
<i>to protect them.</i>

42:19.208 --> 42:20.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:20.500 --> 42:24.000
What if I told you there is a way
you could help children...

42:24.417 --> 42:27.041
<i>Absolutely anything.</i>
