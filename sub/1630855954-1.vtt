You fit right in here.

What the fuck?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.243
Oh.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.327
Yeah.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.246
I know who did that!

Hey, I'm looking for Pam Miller.
Do you know her?

25:45.002 --> 25:46.379
Uh, yeah, everyone knows Pam.

Oh, great. Um, where is she?

Wait. N-No, no.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.603
Pam Miller is, like, nice.

26:02.687 --> 26:05.481
Like, worried about loud music
hurting your eardrums nice.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.150
Are you smoking crack?
Pam Miller's the Wicked Witch of Vernon.

Next time, catch the ball.

26:16.534 --> 26:19.537
Okay? Then I don't have to touch
your gross little kid blood.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.997
Disgusting.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.500
All right!
Good work out there, winners! Huh?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.670
Wish I could say the same for the losers,

GROUP: Thank you, Coach Zane.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.136
My brother bought us
a ton of B&J wine coolers.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.304
Oh, my God, yes.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.014

Pam Miller?

26:41.225 --> 26:42.476
Uh, yeah?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.777
MARISA: Take a picture. It'll last longer.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.195
JAMIE: Uh, sorry.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.574
You're just... not what I was expecting.

26:56.657 --> 26:59.493
Uh, I'm Jamie.

26:59.577 --> 27:00.578
From Canada.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.789
I'm... I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna shake your hand

27:03.873 --> 27:06.000
because I'm not 45 and a man.

27:06.083 --> 27:10.004
Come over after school, and you can
set up for the party while I do my hair.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.758
- Okay.
- You know, where I'm from,

27:13.841 --> 27:17.136
birthday parties are considered so lame.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.847
Like, I don't know,
maybe you should cancel it.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.640
Maybe you should fuck off and die.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.184
- Jesus, Mom!
- (girls laugh)

27:24.101 --> 27:25.102
...macita.

Ay. Ay-yi-yi, <i>mamacita.</i>

27:28.022 --> 27:29.315
Oh.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.275
(speaking Spanish): You speak Spanish?

27:31.359 --> 27:32.485
Okay...

27:33.277 --> 27:35.446
...fuck off and die.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.697
(girls laugh)

27:36.781 --> 27:39.158
Three years of Spanish, bitch.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.243
Fine.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.913
You don't want to cancel the party?
I'll cancel the party.

27:45.164 --> 27:49.001
Old people, sick people
and people with dogs.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.170
- That's the order you hate people in?
- Yep.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.130
It's a good order. Yeah.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.967
Hi. I'd like to report a crime
that hasn't happened yet.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.387
I know that sounds crazy,
but go with me here.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.138
Have you seen the movie
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

28:01.222 --> 28:02.723
No, but I heard it's good.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.183
Yeah, it's great, but...

28:05.101 --> 28:08.813
Basically, I'm-I'm sort of living
that movie right now.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.690
Which is how I know
there's gonna be a murder tonight.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.818
Murder? (laughs)

28:14.402 --> 28:15.986
There's never been a murder in Vernon.

28:16.070 --> 28:19.657
Yeah, there's gonna be a murder
tonight at Tiffany Clark's party,

28:19.740 --> 28:21.867
which is also gonna be
filled with underage drinking,

28:21.951 --> 28:24.537
so you should definitely be there
to shut it down anyway.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.247
(coughs): Geez.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.040
Seriously?

28:28.124 --> 28:29.917
I haven't seen you around before.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.669
Yeah, I'm an exchange student.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.921
From Prince Edward Island, Canada.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.840
- Sounds made-up.
- It's not.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.842
It's a real place.

28:39.844 --> 28:40.845
Lim.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.389
You're the sheriff's dad.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.559
Kara's nickname is The Sheriff?

28:46.642 --> 28:48.227
(laughs): That's sweet.

28:48.310 --> 28:54.066
Hey, look, I am giving you the chance
to stop all this horror before it happens.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.404
Who is this?

28:58.487 --> 29:00.448
- It's the killer.
- Who has he killed?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.700
He hasn't killed anyone yet.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.285
- But that's-that's... (scoffs)
- (sighs)

29:04.368 --> 29:06.620
Can you please just watch
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

29:06.704 --> 29:09.498
Okay, I don't know what you troublemakers
get up to in Canada,

29:09.582 --> 29:12.084
but down here,
we don't tolerate shenanigans.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.504
So get the hell back to school,
or I'll arrest you for truancy.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.174
(sighs)

29:20.134 --> 29:22.011
No one's ever gonna believe me.

29:23.846 --> 29:26.682
- I do want to see that movie, though.
- LIM: Mm. Not me.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.350
Hate time-travel movies.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.478
- They never make any sense.
- Mm.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.736
Hi. Me again.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.654
Jamie LaFleur.

29:40.738 --> 29:44.033
Um, I need to know
what class Lauren Creston is in.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.702
I know that's private information,
but it's an emergency.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.662
I have an EpiPen
that she needs due to a...

29:48.746 --> 29:50.956
Earth Sciences, room 2-7-G.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.500
Oh, thanks.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.584
(sighs)

29:54.502 --> 29:55.503
Oh, my God.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.963
Flying on a plane right now
must be insane.

29:59.507 --> 30:00.758
(door opens)

30:00.841 --> 30:02.092
Hi.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.928
Is Lauren Creston in here?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.518
Oh, my God. (chuckles)

30:11.268 --> 30:12.728
You look great.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.064
What's going on?

30:15.898 --> 30:17.983
Can I talk to you in the hall
for a second?

30:18.067 --> 30:19.777
Please tell me you've seen
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

30:20.611 --> 30:22.279
- Of course.
- (sighs) Thank God.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.657
Think of me as Marty McFly.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.951
35 years from now, your daughter,

30:27.034 --> 30:29.787
Amelia, who's my best friend,
builds a time machine

30:29.870 --> 30:32.790
based off of plans from a notebook--
your notebook.

30:32.873 --> 30:36.585
It's called, like, "Lauren Creston's
Brilliant and Unusual Ideas."

30:36.669 --> 30:41.173
And I used the time machine to escape
a killer who had recently resurfaced

30:41.257 --> 30:44.677
after being long dormant
ever since his first murder spree,

30:44.760 --> 30:46.053
which begins tonight.

30:46.136 --> 30:50.307
So I need your help to catch the killer
so he can't kill my mom.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.392
'Cause...

30:52.476 --> 30:53.477
'cause he killed...

30:54.186 --> 30:56.480
'cause he killed my mom in the future.

30:56.564 --> 31:00.901
And then I also need you to figure out
how to modify the time machine

31:00.985 --> 31:04.738
to send me home, because
Amelia said it needs Wi-Fi to work,

31:04.822 --> 31:08.784
and you guys don't have that yet,
so that's... that's not great.

31:11.453 --> 31:12.913
No one knows about my notebook.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.331
Except for me.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.000
'Cause I'm from the future.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.085
Oh, here. I have proof.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.299
Is this the time machine?

31:23.382 --> 31:26.010
No, that's my phone.
Do you want to see the time machine?

31:28.137 --> 31:29.388
Wait, I don't understand.

31:29.471 --> 31:33.767
If the killer's targeting the Mollys,
why wait 35 years to kill your mom?

31:33.851 --> 31:34.852
Who are the Mollys?

31:34.935 --> 31:37.313
Oh, Tiffany, Marisa, Heather, Pam.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.565
They call themselves the Mollys
after Molly Ringwald.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.400
They're obsessed with her.
They even dress like her.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.736
I had no idea
the four of them were so close.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.363
I just thought they knew each other
because it's Vernon

31:46.447 --> 31:47.948
and everybody knows each other.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.331
Here you go.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.499
(sighs) Time machine.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.669
LAUREN: Interesting.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.589
It's weird. It wasn't working before,
but when the killer attacked me

32:03.672 --> 32:06.800
and stabbed the knife into that panel,
it did all of a sudden.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.094
It must have needed
an extra metal conductor.

32:09.178 --> 32:11.263
Yeah, yeah, extra metal conductor.
That's what I said.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.349
(unzips bag)

32:13.432 --> 32:14.808
Is your bag all tools?

32:14.892 --> 32:15.934
You don't have any books?

32:16.018 --> 32:17.853
I read all my books.
Tools are more useful.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.772
Mm.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.982
- What is this? Oh.
- Oh, my God.

32:22.066 --> 32:24.068
- Careful with that nail gun.
- Sorry.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.486
I can't repair a time machine

32:25.569 --> 32:27.905
that my future daughter invented
if I'm killed by clumsiness.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.282
Hey, you're taking this all really well,
by the way.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.451
You don't start trying to invent
time travel without considering

32:32.534 --> 32:35.496
the possibility that people
from the future will need your help.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.831
- That killer thing is surprising, though.
- Yeah.

32:37.915 --> 32:41.710
Speaking of,
if I stop the murders from happening,

32:41.794 --> 32:45.130
will that cause, like,
a rip in the space-time continuum?

32:45.214 --> 32:47.633
I don't know. There are a lot of theories
about time travel.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.594
The one that I consider to be
the most promising is...

32:50.678 --> 32:52.054
How much do you know about
quantum mechanics?

32:52.137 --> 32:53.222
I saw <i>Endgame.</i>

32:54.056 --> 32:55.599
But I didn't really understand it.

32:56.183 --> 33:00.354
All right.
Um, imagine that time is like a river.

33:00.437 --> 33:03.899
You got out of the river,
ran upstream and then jumped back in.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.275
Now everything keeps flowing,

33:05.359 --> 33:08.320
so whatever changes you make,
they'll trickle downstream.

33:08.404 --> 33:12.282
So if I change everything for the better,
it's okay.

33:12.866 --> 33:13.867
Theoretically.

33:13.951 --> 33:18.038
And if time keeps flowing,
what's happening back home?

33:18.122 --> 33:19.748
<i>Billy the Beaver says, "Have..."</i>

33:19.832 --> 33:21.542
(distorted): <i>"...fun."</i> (chuckles)

33:21.625 --> 33:22.876
<i>Billy the Beaver...</i>

33:22.960 --> 33:25.796
Let's get all the science fair kids
out of here and secure the location.

33:25.879 --> 33:26.880
Okay.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.841
Kara, where's Jamie?
Have they found her yet?

33:28.924 --> 33:30.634
- No, not yet.
- (sighs)

33:30.718 --> 33:32.511
(phone clicking)

33:32.594 --> 33:34.304
What are you doing?

33:34.388 --> 33:36.181
Taking notes for a new episode?

33:36.265 --> 33:39.309
You know, it's not a good look to be the
guy stopping people from investigating.

33:39.393 --> 33:40.728
Is that what you're doing?

33:40.811 --> 33:42.354
I'm an investigative journalist.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.314
No, your dad is.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.399
You're a tour guide.

33:46.233 --> 33:48.318
AMELIA: Oh, Mr. Hughes! Mr. Hughes!

33:48.402 --> 33:50.529
I know where Jamie is.
She used my time machine.

33:50.612 --> 33:53.574
Um, I made a time machine
for the science fair.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.159
God, she's as weird as her mom.

33:55.743 --> 33:57.327
Jamie's in 1987.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.747
I don't know where my time machine is,
so it must have worked.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.873
I'm just trying to figure...

34:00.956 --> 34:02.583
You like science fiction? Go write a book.

34:02.666 --> 34:06.670
But here, in the real world,
I am gonna solve this case.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.550
BLAKE: Kara!

34:11.633 --> 34:14.428
Uh, I have several follow-up questions.

34:14.511 --> 34:15.804
First question...

34:17.598 --> 34:19.933
- Do I really have to come in with you?
- JAMIE: Yes.

34:20.017 --> 34:23.103
There's a murderer at this party.
No way I'm going in alone.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.938
- (lively chatter in distance)
- (Jamie sighs)

34:25.022 --> 34:26.607
Thanks for letting me borrow some clothes.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.691
Yeah, no problem.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.359
(Jamie sighs)

34:29.943 --> 34:31.820
JAMIE: God, this place is beautiful.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.156
I can't believe
they turned it into a Zatta Burger.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.283
You guys have Zatta Burger yet?

34:36.366 --> 34:38.243
- LAUREN: I have no idea what that is.
- Oh.

34:41.622 --> 34:42.748
- Hey, what's up?
- Randy!

34:42.831 --> 34:44.541
- What's up? Head on in.
- Thanks, dude.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.877
(chuckles): Hey, whoa! I can't let you in.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.921
There's a dress code.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.256
- What? No, there isn't.
- (scoffs) Yeah, there is.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.966
- No nerd jewelry. (laughs)
- Hey.

I got to find Tiffany...

35:18.116 --> 35:19.952

- Unwanted human.

Hey! Hey! Wait!

35:29.878 --> 35:32.172
(frustrated grunt)
God, I got to get in there.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.716
I might know another way in.

(grunting)

35:43.809 --> 35:44.810
(grunts)

35:47.479 --> 35:48.897

35:48.981 --> 35:51.149
- Yeah. Uh, Prince Edward Island.
- Oh.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.610
I spent the summer there once
with my aunt. Yeah.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.947
Did you know the average age
on the island is 49.5?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.156
Cool, right?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.158
Great. Great.

36:00.242 --> 36:01.577
Yeah. I'm staying with Lauren.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.829
Uh, yes.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.623
Okay. Round two. (chuckles)

36:08.292 --> 36:09.293
Hey, Doug.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.962
Hey, why don't you give us a boost?

36:12.629 --> 36:15.757
Righteous. Then I'll go back around
to the front, and-and you can let me in.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.467
Great.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.386
- All right.
- All right.

36:19.469 --> 36:20.470
Thank you.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.515

All right, well,
I'm here to stop a murder,

37:52.312 --> 37:54.272
so let's stop a murder.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.198
Dope party, ladies.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.534
What are you doing?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.662
You know what would
make this party even cooler?

38:09.329 --> 38:11.206
The police. Let's call 'em.

"Don't Stand So Close to Me."

38:19.715 --> 38:21.008
- Thank you.
- You know,

38:21.091 --> 38:23.260
this whole mean girls shtick
is really outdated.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.721

39:04.134 --> 39:07.429
Is that... is that, like, a real person?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.306
I was worried you forgot to let me in.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.726
Kind of relieved to see
you were just being bullied.

39:14.061 --> 39:15.312
(grunts)

39:17.189 --> 39:19.691

please don't do this!

39:40.796 --> 39:42.214
What happened?

39:42.297 --> 39:44.591
Some loser narc told him
I made out with Eddie Royal.

You made out with Eddie Royal?

39:46.802 --> 39:48.887
- Yeah.

Wait. Tiffany!

MARISA: Looks like another breakup.
Those two are so dramatic.

BLAKE:
I fucking hate that guy! I need a drink.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.321

- Oh, my God.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.825
Ladies, Tiffany is in a crisis.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.410
It's time to be good girlfriends
and stay with her the whole night.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.121
Let's never leave her side.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.414
- Randy.
- (fingers snap)

40:18.792 --> 40:20.210
- Come on, let's go.
- What?

40:20.293 --> 40:22.254

40:22.337 --> 40:23.922
- (murmuring)
- BOY: What?

40:24.005 --> 40:25.549
How did you do that?

40:27.092 --> 40:29.344
My mom taught me self-defense.

40:32.139 --> 40:34.641
Tiffany? Tiffany?

Oh, Eddie, I should've been with you
this whole time.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.155
I'm so glad Jamie made me realize it.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.241
Is it weird that
we're in your parents' room?

40:51.324 --> 40:52.325

But I heard that Zack Ritrovatti
and Valerie Mosco

40:54.619 --> 40:56.538
are doing anal in my bedroom again.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.583
Besides, I've always wanted
to hook up on a waterbed.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.502
Wait.

41:02.586 --> 41:03.795
I have to pee.

41:03.879 --> 41:04.921
Too many BJs.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.924
Hopefully, there's room for one more.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.927
Oh. Ew. I don't do blow jobs.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.262
You pee out of that thing.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.639

46:12.187 --> 46:13.980
You know, I didn't even really like her.

46:14.731 --> 46:16.483
She was so mean.

46:16.566 --> 46:18.526
And not even in a funny way like...

46:18.610 --> 46:21.446
like when I convinced Lisa Vitzlaki
that Randy was in love with her

46:21.529 --> 46:23.907

at the talent show.

She wasn't a great person,

46:40.340 --> 46:42.759

Tiffany was gonna get murdered tonight.

46:54.354 --> 46:55.605
Obviously.

46:57.690 --> 47:02.487
But maybe with your help,
we can stop the rest.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.822

47:12.497 --> 47:13.665
And you.

47:13.748 --> 47:15.458
You're all in danger.

47:19.045 --> 47:21.047
Um, see, this is my, um...

47:22.131 --> 47:23.758
(sighs) This is my...

47:24.801 --> 47:26.970
psychic crystal.

47:38.273 --> 47:39.482
Looks legit.

47:42.902 --> 47:44.821
So how far into the future can you see?

47:45.613 --> 47:47.657
(sighs) Till the year 2023.

47:47.740 --> 47:49.117
(gasps)

47:50.118 --> 47:52.078
- (overlapping chatter over TV)
- ROBOT: <i>You're in direct violation</i>

47:52.161 --> 47:54.789
<i>of penal code 113, section 9.</i>

47:54.872 --> 47:57.625
- (woman screaming over TV)
- <i>You now have five seconds to comply.</i>

47:57.709 --> 48:02.589
- MAN: <i>Help! Help me! Help! Help me!</i>
- ROBOT: <i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

48:02.672 --> 48:06.050
<i>I am now authorized to use physical force.</i>

48:07.343 --> 48:09.345
(screaming and gunfire continues over TV)

48:19.814 --> 48:21.691
Do the machines kill us all?

48:23.151 --> 48:24.611
Um, no.

48:25.194 --> 48:28.489
No, the machines don't... kill us all.

48:28.573 --> 48:29.574
They more just...

48:30.283 --> 48:33.703
rip apart the fabric of our society
via dance videos on TikTok.

48:34.454 --> 48:36.164
They use dance against us?

48:36.956 --> 48:39.334
I cannot believe
Pam Miller's a sci-fi nerd.

48:39.417 --> 48:40.877
Tell anyone and I'll kill you.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.254
Okay, okay, let's, uh, let's focus.

48:43.963 --> 48:46.174
I, um...

48:49.135 --> 48:51.304
I foresee that...

48:52.180 --> 48:55.350
Marisa is gonna be the next victim.

48:55.433 --> 48:56.476
(whispers): Oh, no.

48:56.559 --> 49:01.189
And it's gonna happen the day
after tomorrow at a cabin in the woods.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.607
My God.

49:02.690 --> 49:08.696
Pam, can you think of anyone
who doesn't like the Mollys?

49:08.780 --> 49:11.324
Maybe someone whose life you ruined

49:11.407 --> 49:15.078
or gave some kind of psychological scar

49:15.161 --> 49:17.664
that would make them
want to, like, hunt you down

49:17.747 --> 49:21.084
and-and kill you
in, like, a ritualistic way?

49:21.167 --> 49:22.543
No.

49:22.627 --> 49:24.003
No, no one.

49:26.047 --> 49:28.883
I mean, Alvin, maybe.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.968
We used to make fun of his eye patch.

49:31.511 --> 49:33.221
Oh, uh, and Wendy.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.264
And Tyler.

49:35.348 --> 49:38.101
And Amy Wolf.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.228
Creepy Ron. Fat Trish.

49:40.311 --> 49:45.525
Lisa Vitzlaki, I guess, if we're saying
that the talent show thing wasn't funny.

49:45.608 --> 49:49.320
Oh, uh, and, uh, Jenny Hudson
and Jenny Grisante...

49:49.404 --> 49:52.532
Hi, girls. Just checking on you,
seeing if you need anything.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.617
God, Mom, we're fine!

49:54.701 --> 49:56.494
We're fine!

49:56.577 --> 49:59.205
Okay, well, I know
you've been through a lot tonight...

49:59.288 --> 50:02.667
Yes, we have, and you're just
making it worse, so can you please go?

50:04.127 --> 50:05.128
Leave us!

50:08.715 --> 50:10.591
(quietly):
No wonder Grandma never comes to visit.

50:10.675 --> 50:11.801
(door closes)

50:12.385 --> 50:14.095
You shouldn't talk to your mom that way.

50:14.846 --> 50:17.265
You never know when...

50:19.892 --> 50:21.102
She just cares about you.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.270
(scoffs)

50:22.353 --> 50:25.648
Oh, so, what, like, you have
a great relationship with your mom?

50:26.399 --> 50:27.400
No.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.152
But I wish I did.

50:30.153 --> 50:32.447
And I wish I told her
that I loved her more.

50:34.449 --> 50:35.950
I just didn't understand what she...

50:36.033 --> 50:38.745
Hey. I'm saying this as a friend.

50:39.495 --> 50:42.373
But nobody wants to hear you talk about
how much you love your mom, okay?

50:42.457 --> 50:44.292
Okay. Sorry.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.961
What about Randy? Could he be a suspect?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.379
He's a big dumb meathead.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.465
No. Randy loved Tiffany.

50:51.215 --> 50:53.134
He asked her
to the Spring Fling last year.

50:54.218 --> 50:57.847
He also asked Marisa and Heather and me.

50:58.723 --> 51:00.808
So I can understand
why he would be mad at us.

51:00.892 --> 51:03.436
He can't be mad at you for rejecting him.
That's fucked-up.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.563
Do you think that I should date him?

51:06.063 --> 51:08.775
Just in case he is the killer
and that makes him decide not to kill me?

51:08.858 --> 51:11.736
No, no. Don't date Randy.
That's not who you're supposed to be with.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.946
- Well, then who am I supposed to be with?
- Blake.

51:16.324 --> 51:19.327
Really? Blake?

51:19.410 --> 51:20.703
Oh, my God.

51:20.787 --> 51:22.455
(laughs)

51:23.164 --> 51:25.500
You know, I have always been
so secretly obsessed with Blake.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.752
Oh, I could never do that to Tiffany.

51:27.835 --> 51:31.589
Uh, good, good, because you and Blake
don't get together for a while now.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.716
Like, uh, years from now.

51:33.800 --> 51:38.054
Well, if we're meant to be and timing
doesn't matter and Tiffany's dead...

51:39.639 --> 51:41.974
- I'm gonna have sex with Blake.
- No, no, no.

51:42.058 --> 51:46.103
You're too horny, and you'll-you'll cheat
on each other and-and mess it up,

51:46.187 --> 51:48.356
and then you won't get to go
on the Quantum Drop together

51:48.439 --> 51:50.733
where you'll find out a really important
thing that you're gonna find out.

51:50.817 --> 51:52.568
So just-just no hooking up with Blake.

51:52.652 --> 51:54.111
Until college.

51:54.195 --> 51:55.279
Okay, great.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.031
So, you two will work on
finding the killer,

51:57.114 --> 52:00.243
and then I'll work on
fixing the time mach-- m-maker.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.203
Time maker.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.955
It's a fancy word for clock.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.665
(machine beeping, whirring)

52:17.051 --> 52:18.594
(soft whooshing)

52:21.097 --> 52:24.100
- So, is that the time machine 2.0?
- (gasps)

52:24.684 --> 52:25.685
Uh...

52:26.269 --> 52:30.064
No, right now it's just a cheap
piece of shit I got off of Craigslist.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.482
- (sparks pop, machine stops)
- Whoa.

52:32.233 --> 52:34.193
Um, what are you doing here?

52:34.861 --> 52:38.197
CHRIS:
I know everything about these murders.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.993
But a couple of days ago,
I said Tiffany was murdered in her garage.

52:42.076 --> 52:43.077
But she wasn't.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.454
She was killed on her parents' waterbed.

52:45.538 --> 52:48.040
That's a basic detail.
How could I forget that?

52:48.708 --> 52:50.209
The Mandela Effect.

52:51.586 --> 52:55.548
It's a psychological phenomenon where
people remember things that didn't happen.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.259
Like people thinking
Nelson Mandela died in jail.

52:58.342 --> 53:00.970
But there's a theory
that those memories aren't false.

53:01.053 --> 53:04.724
They're just lingering from
a past life that was altered...

53:05.766 --> 53:06.934
via time travel.

53:08.936 --> 53:11.147
Hey, what... what's that?

53:11.230 --> 53:12.481
CHRIS: Oh, "stab the machine."

53:12.565 --> 53:16.193
The cops thought that was a reference
to some heavy metal anarchy lyrics.

53:16.277 --> 53:18.487
That's what led them
to investigate Eddie Royal.

53:19.238 --> 53:20.239
Eddie Royal?

53:20.323 --> 53:22.408
- Yeah.
- Like the lead singer of A Waterbed Away?

53:22.491 --> 53:23.618
(chuckles)

53:25.286 --> 53:27.872
Why would they think that?
He's, like, super emo.

53:27.955 --> 53:28.956
CHRIS: That's so weird.

53:30.166 --> 53:31.167
I thought...

53:31.250 --> 53:32.877
The Mandela Effect, I guess.

53:33.461 --> 53:35.129
What's the "J" at the end?

53:35.212 --> 53:36.213
CHRIS: That's a "J"?

53:36.797 --> 53:38.674
Everyone thought that was a demonic rune.

53:39.467 --> 53:41.218
Do you have more photos from that night?

53:41.302 --> 53:43.888
Uh, yeah, the official crime scene ones

53:43.971 --> 53:47.058
and ones I took at the party
for the yearbook.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.520
(gasps) There she is!

53:51.604 --> 53:52.772
- That's her!
- Holy shit.

53:52.855 --> 53:54.649
AMELIA (laughing): Oh, my God.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.442
Jamie's back in 1987.

53:56.525 --> 53:59.654
That note-- The note was a message to me.

53:59.737 --> 54:02.073
"Stab the machine." "Stab the machine."

54:02.156 --> 54:04.325
The killer's knife must have got stuck
in the conductor somehow,

54:04.408 --> 54:07.620
and Jamie's trying to tell me
that I need an extra metal conductor.

54:07.703 --> 54:09.872
Are we sure
that's not just a demonic rune?

54:09.956 --> 54:12.875
It's not a rune, Chris.
Jamie's trying to solve the murders.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.835
But they're all still dead.

54:15.795 --> 54:19.882
Well, yeah, Tiffany is, but Heather and
Marisa's murders haven't happened yet.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.802
Okay, you see, time happens all at once.

54:22.885 --> 54:24.470
It's like a river.

54:24.553 --> 54:25.846
Yeah.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.264
Okay, so...

54:28.516 --> 54:30.017
NORM: Good afternoon.

54:30.101 --> 54:33.312
Last night, we learned
police have taken Eddie Cockburn--

54:33.396 --> 54:36.065
known to students as Eddie Royal--
into custody for questioning.

54:36.649 --> 54:38.484
Why do they think it's Eddie?

54:38.567 --> 54:41.570
They're wasting their time. It's not him.

54:41.654 --> 54:45.157
This tragedy has rocked
the community of Vernon.

54:45.241 --> 54:49.120
For KZFD News, this is Norm Dubasage.

54:55.167 --> 54:57.044
LAUREN: Look at that.

54:57.128 --> 54:58.462
She will be missed.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.297
Mostly.

55:00.381 --> 55:01.382
(laughter nearby)

55:01.465 --> 55:02.967
(Pam whispering indistinctly)

55:04.051 --> 55:06.971
If I fuck up my parents falling in love
and getting married,

55:08.389 --> 55:10.891
will I just, like, disappear?

55:10.975 --> 55:12.309
<i>Back to the Future</i> got that wrong.

55:12.393 --> 55:14.103
No, you would not disappear.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.730
This isn't magic.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.565
If your parents don't get married
and have kids,

55:17.648 --> 55:20.067
then you'd basically just have
no life to go home to.

55:20.151 --> 55:23.279
Because everything would be different.
No one would have any idea who you are.

55:23.779 --> 55:24.905
Save you a seat at lunch.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.115
Great.

55:31.037 --> 55:33.039
(sighs) Hey.

55:33.748 --> 55:35.833
- How's everyone doing?
- MARISA: Ugh.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.668
You're wearing that jacket again?

55:38.753 --> 55:41.047
Is no one here
in touch with their emotions?

55:41.130 --> 55:43.632
Well, I'm in touch with this emotion.
(laughs)

55:43.716 --> 55:45.301
(hands clap)

55:45.384 --> 55:47.636
You know, I'm-I'm sure that
they'll mention something in the yearbook.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.722
They did last year when Fat Trish died.

55:50.514 --> 55:51.682
And I like your jacket.

55:53.934 --> 55:56.103
Uh, who's Fat Trish?

55:56.187 --> 55:58.898
Also, you can't call her that.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.900
Yeah, not anymore. She's dead.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.526
How'd she die?

56:02.610 --> 56:03.944
Car accident.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.738
They said her alcohol level
was, like, really high

56:05.821 --> 56:07.198
and that the car wrapped around the tree.

56:07.281 --> 56:08.741
(scoffs)
Yeah, that's why chicks shouldn't drive.

56:08.824 --> 56:13.287
No, Randy, it's why
people shouldn't drive drunk.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.747
I'm a better driver when I'm drunk.

56:14.830 --> 56:15.998
No, you're not.

56:16.082 --> 56:18.667
I can 100% guarantee you you are not.

56:18.751 --> 56:20.795
That's exactly what a chick would say.
(chuckles)

56:21.587 --> 56:23.047
Blake, wait up.

56:39.146 --> 56:41.190
- PAM: Did you draw that?
- BLAKE: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

56:41.273 --> 56:43.234
That's so beautiful.

56:43.317 --> 56:44.735
You're such an artist.

56:44.819 --> 56:48.114
I don't know.
Maybe I should just cancel my party.

56:48.197 --> 56:49.490
It feels in poor taste now.

56:49.573 --> 56:51.408
But it's your birthday.

56:51.492 --> 56:55.162
Oh, hey, why don't we do,
um, like, a girls' trip?

56:55.246 --> 56:58.791
Just, uh, just the three of us. And Pam.

56:58.874 --> 57:00.251
- Pam?
- (giggles)

57:00.334 --> 57:02.128
- Pam?
- (slapping desk)

57:02.211 --> 57:04.964
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. Th-That would be fun.

57:05.047 --> 57:06.382
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we could, like, uh,

57:06.465 --> 57:08.259
go to the city, you know?

57:08.342 --> 57:11.554
Like a nice, densely populated, well-lit,

57:11.637 --> 57:14.390
non-rural, non-cabin area.

57:14.473 --> 57:17.643
I guess it could be fun
to spend the night at my parents' condo.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.645
(gasps) Yes. Yes.

57:19.728 --> 57:21.939
Condo birthday. I love that for you.

57:22.022 --> 57:23.107
Let's do it.

57:23.190 --> 57:26.694
Also, I was thinking,
a nice way to memorialize Tiffany

57:26.777 --> 57:31.198
and give back to the environment
would be to plant a tree in her honor.

57:31.282 --> 57:36.036
I'm starting a petition, so if you guys
could just all print your names

57:36.120 --> 57:40.666
very clearly here in big block letters
so I can see your handwriting.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.710
- Tiffany hated nature.
- Trees made her sneeze.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.587
Give back to this environment.

57:44.670 --> 57:46.046
(laughter)

57:46.130 --> 57:47.756
Don't worry, it's not my crotch hand.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.050
PARR: So...

57:50.134 --> 57:53.304
tragedy has struck,

57:53.387 --> 57:55.014
and that's very sad.

57:55.097 --> 57:59.435
But there's nothing we can do about it
except move on.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.771
So, take out your beakers.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.983
LaFleur, go partner up with Damon.

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:13.963
Oh, God, if this is a body.

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.844
(sighs) Thank God.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:27.060
(groans) Fine.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.728
Fine.

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.439
Take whatever you want.
Just please leave the <i>ThunderCats.</i>

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:35.568
I don't want your video games.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.403
Those are the only things worthwhile.

01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:42.325
Why were you parked
outside Tiffany's party?

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:44.494
I wanted to go.

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:48.414
I sat outside listening to Meat Loaf,
trying to build up the courage, but...

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.503
I know people think I'm scary,
but I'm not a killer.

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:57.298
- (gasps) Oh.
- What's going on?

01:17:57.382 --> 01:17:58.466
Doug.

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.636
Only hall monitors are allowed outdoors
during school hours.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.263
Uh, we were, um, we were just...

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.348
Video games much?

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:07.850
Uh, yeah.

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:11.104
I know it's nerdy,
but I want to make them someday.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.814
You ever play <i>Death Wish 3?</i>

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:14.482
The graphics are amazing.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.984
When you kill someone,
they explode into pink mist.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.028
We should go inside.

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.238
It's not safe out here.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.781
You guys are safe with me.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.908
- I took karate for eight years.
- Where?

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:25.618
Tom's Dojo at the mall.

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:28.121
And the police cruise by here,
like, every two minutes.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.957
I wouldn't trust Sheriff Lim
to solve anything.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.501
He was convinced it was Eddie
even after I told him there was no way.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:37.046
I know it wasn't Eddie,
but how do you know it wasn't Eddie?

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.007
He told me all about that night,
how he was making out with Tiffany

01:18:40.091 --> 01:18:42.593
but then left as soon as she said
she doesn't do blow jobs.

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:44.929
Just think.

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:48.433
Maybe if she did do blow jobs,
she'd still be alive.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:52.437
Yeah, let's-let's not
make that the lesson.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:56.399
(lively chatter)

01:18:58.484 --> 01:18:59.527
- Hey.
- Hey. You catch the killer yet?

01:19:00.862 --> 01:19:02.697
No. Is the photo booth working?

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.781
No.

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:07.952
There's a super futuristic generator
in here, but it's busted.

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:10.955
There's no way this thing can generate
enough force to power the time machine.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.166
That's the time machine? Just that?

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:17.712
Imagine this is a computer
and this is the power button.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.548
Okay, so we need a new power button.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:23.259
Yep, one that can generate
a shit ton of force,

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:25.219
enough to basically disrupt gravity.

01:19:29.182 --> 01:19:30.683
Like the Quantum Drop?

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.773
(heavy metal music playing over speakers)

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:40.193
(laser sound effects playing)

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:44.197
And here we are back on Earth.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:47.241
Thank you so much
for riding the Quantum Drop.

01:19:47.325 --> 01:19:50.328
Please save your vomit
for outside the ride

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:54.916
and enjoy the rest of your day
at Billy's Boardwalk.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.417
(riders groaning, murmuring)

01:19:56.501 --> 01:19:58.753
Hey. Uh, we've been sent by the city.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.379
We got to shut down the ride.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.423
One of the, uh, exterior panels...

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:04.509
Quantum Drop goes down, Ned goes on break.

01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:05.968
That's all you had to say.

01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:07.887
(Ned sighs)

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:11.349
Oh. He really just left.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.560
God, the '80s are wild.

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:18.773
Okay.

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:20.566
I'm good here. You go catch the killer.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:22.151
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:28.157
So, as I told Pam, I'm psychic.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.034
And I thought Heather was
gonna be killed tonight

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:31.994
at the Halloween Carnival
in the parking lot,

01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:35.706
but since she's already dead,
he's probably gonna go after Marisa.

01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:37.291
- Oh, my God.
- Or me.

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.962
If your visions are wrong,
then anything can happen.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:45.550
Yeah, I mean, no one's safe,
so if anyone wants to leave, do it now.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.057
I want to catch him.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.977
Even if he does kill Marisa
and the rest of us live...

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.436
Oh, Jesus.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.523
...I don't want to go my whole life
knowing that that psycho killed my friends

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.066
and he's still out there.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:04.735
Me either.
Let's break this motherfucker, huh?

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:08.739
- I-I really don't want to be the bait.
- JAMIE: You're gonna be okay.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:11.659
Now, the second you see him, press this.

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:13.452
It's a rape alarm. It's insanely loud.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:14.662
And if you get scared at all...

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:16.163
- (alarm blaring)
- Oh. Okay.

01:21:16.247 --> 01:21:18.416
All right. No. Uh...

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:20.334
- (alarm stops)
- (sighs) Now you know how it works.

01:21:20.418 --> 01:21:24.547
But what if he slits her throat before
she has a chance to press the rape button?

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.215
- What the fuck?
- I don't know.

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:28.718
That's not his M.O. The killer always
stabs his victims 16 times.

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:30.636
Okay, that does not make me feel better.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.762
You're gonna be fine.

01:21:31.846 --> 01:21:33.806
Just-just walk to the Dollhouse of Horrors

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.017
as if you're planning
to meet someone there to blow them.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.477
- Blow them.
- Yeah, you do it all the time.

01:21:40.146 --> 01:21:41.355
Yeah.

01:21:41.439 --> 01:21:43.774
- And we'll be right there waiting.
- Okay.

01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:46.027
(inhales deeply)

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.279
You're just gonna go blow somebody.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.864
That's all.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:51.949

that we took to the Field Museum?

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:39.213
They got their braces stuck together

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.090
because they were making out
in the back of the bus.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:42.299
JAMIE: But that's crazy.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:46.220
He hunted you down and murdered you
because you made fun of his girlfriend?

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:47.846
Oh, my God.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.807
He must have known about the sleepover.

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.100
What sleepover?

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.103
(sighs) The night she died, we...

01:27:54.979 --> 01:27:58.357
There was a rumor
that Trish had sex with Coach Zane.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.525
We wanted to know if it was true,

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:01.819
so Tiffany invited her over
and got her really drunk.

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:03.946
- TIFFANY: <i>Have another.</i>
- Oh, my God.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:05.698
She denied it, but Tiffany kept asking,

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.367
and she started crying
and then locked herself in Tiffany's room.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.702
- TRISH: <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- <i>(door slams)</i>

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.286
And she must have called Doug.

01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:13.497
And then... and then she left.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:16.458
You got her drunk and let her drive home?

01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:18.460
We tried to stop her,
but she was too upset.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:19.545
LAUREN: Jamie!

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:21.296
Oh, my God.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.632
It was Doug? Oh, we need to go right now.

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:25.801
I got it working,
but your phone's almost dead.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:27.177
How could you do that?

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:28.846
You killed someone.

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:31.265
No, I didn't.

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:32.599
Yes, you did.

01:28:32.683 --> 01:28:35.686
You pretended to be her friend,
bullied her,

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:38.439
got her wasted
and then let her drive home!

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:39.606
Pam wasn't there.

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:43.152
Tiff and I got in a fight over the summer.

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:45.779
We didn't talk for months.

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:49.283
I would never do something like that.

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.201
Do you just think
that I'm some sort of monster?

01:28:51.285 --> 01:28:52.786
Jamie, we really need to go.

01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:55.330
Then why would Doug promise
to kill you one day?

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:57.791
- He didn't.
- He was going to.

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:00.210
He was gonna leave a note.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.173
This note.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:09.887
Okay, well, it doesn't matter now, right?
He's dead.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.597
(gasping)

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.640
- (all screaming)
- (alarm blaring)

01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:19.605
Daddy gave me this, too!

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:22.149
(screams) Motherfucker!

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:23.275
He's from the future!

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.401
I fucked up his mask.

01:29:24.485 --> 01:29:25.611
That's adult Doug!

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:27.863
You killed Doug.
There is no adult Doug anymore.

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:29.573
And how the hell did he even get here?

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:30.949
Amelia.

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:38.123
Oh, my God.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:40.709
Amelia?

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.128
Amelia?

01:29:43.212 --> 01:29:45.631
Amelia? Amelia, can you hear me?

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:50.719
(clicking empty)

01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:58.477
Oh, my God! Fuck!

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.396
Run! Run! Run!

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.856
- Run!
- (others scream)

01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:11.281
Are you sure the Quantum Drop works?

01:30:11.365 --> 01:30:13.367
As long as KZFD keeps broadcasting live.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.494
<i>And for KZFD, this is Norm Dubasage</i>

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:17.496
- <i>wishing you a happy Hallow...</i>
- JAMIE: <i>Don't stop filming!</i>

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:19.081
<i>The killer's here! Keep rolling!</i>

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:20.332
<i>One moment, folks.</i>

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.167
<i>There appears to be</i>
<i>some sort of foot chase,</i>

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.044
<i>and a young woman just gave me a warn...</i>

01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:25.254
- (grunts)
- (people screaming)

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.421
- WOMAN: <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- (choking)

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:27.756
MAN: <i>Don't stop!</i>

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.424
<i>Keep rolling! Keep rolling!</i>

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.510
Holy shit,
he just got stabbed in the head!

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:34.304
I can't leave yet. I haven't stopped him.
My mom...

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:35.848
You have to go now or you never will.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:37.141
I'll send you back earlier in the day.

01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:39.309
That way, you can at least
save your mom in the future.

01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:42.271
This control pod is the only place that's
not affected by the centrifugal force.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.231
Once it's up to speed,
you have to stay in here.

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:45.607
What happens if you fall out?

01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:46.984
You'd get thrown against the wall

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:49.194
with the same force as a rocket launch
and probably explode.

01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:52.030
Good luck. Tell my daughter I said hi.

01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:55.576
- Give my mom this.
- Okay.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:57.744
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:30:57.828 --> 01:30:59.246
Go.

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:01.498
Go! Get out of here!

01:31:01.582 --> 01:31:02.958
Go! Get out!

01:31:03.041 --> 01:31:04.376
Get out!

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.503
- It's gonna take him with you!
- Better than leaving him here!

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:07.629
Go!

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.469
(shouts)

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:16.180
Mom! No!

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.435
(shouts)

01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:24.688
- (machine whirring)
- (electricity crackling)

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:30.235
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:33.947
You had this vision I was supposed to be
in the Quantum Drop for a big moment.

01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:35.949
I think that moment was connected to you.

01:31:36.033 --> 01:31:38.202
Me and you have been in here before.

01:31:39.286 --> 01:31:41.079
(whirring continues faster)

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.003
Let's get this fucker!

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:52.007
(strained grunting)

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:00.933
(Jamie screams)

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:05.979
(whirring continues faster)

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:11.318
(shouts)

01:32:12.945 --> 01:32:14.112
(Pam panting)

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.299
(footsteps thudding)

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.431
(screams)

01:32:41.515 --> 01:32:43.517
(strained whimpering)

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:46.645
No.

01:32:48.522 --> 01:32:50.482
(grunts, pants)

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:52.401
(footsteps continue)

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:02.452
No.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.670
(grunting)

01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:16.967
- (screams)
- No!

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.013
(screams)

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.105
You killed my mom!

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:32.357
Twice. It seems.

01:33:32.441 --> 01:33:34.568
And your own dad.

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:36.486
That was just a bonus.

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:38.947
I'm still alive in 1987.

01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:42.284
Now that Chris won't have
to deal with a piece-of-shit dad

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:46.621
who cares more about his legacy
than his own fucking son!

01:33:48.081 --> 01:33:51.752
My mom never got
a note in her locker in 1987.

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:54.254
You wrote it after she died.

01:33:54.338 --> 01:33:56.465
Why would you do this?

01:33:56.548 --> 01:33:57.924
Continue the story.

01:33:58.008 --> 01:34:02.763
It's hard to sustain interest
in three kills 35 years ago.

01:34:02.846 --> 01:34:05.307
But now the Sweet 16 Killer's back,

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.392
and he's a bogeyman.

01:34:07.476 --> 01:34:09.853
He could be anywhere at any time.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:11.063
Can't be killed.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:14.399
He's Michael fucking Myers! (laughs)

01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:16.902
And I'm the expert.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.988
Although, I had no idea
the original killer was Doug,

01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:21.990
so thank you for that.

01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:24.576
The more people care about
the Sweet 16 murders,

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:26.661
the more famous I become.

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.955
Maybe one day I'll get a Pulitzer.

01:34:29.039 --> 01:34:33.794
No one's ever gonna know about you because
you are gonna die in my time machine!

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.670
Not if I'm in the center!

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.589
(machine pulsing, crackling)

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:39.299
(panting)

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:49.351

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:55.023

01:34:56.733 --> 01:34:58.360
(groans)

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.238
(singsongy): I have both knives.

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:03.323
(Chris straining)

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:10.205
You shouldn't have time-traveled.

01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:12.207
And you shouldn't have
messed with my family!

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:14.501
(nail gun firing rapidly)

01:35:16.378 --> 01:35:17.546
(panting)

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.089
Enjoy the ride.

01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:24.970
Huh.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:26.805
Pink mist.

What do you mean what are they doing here?

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:01.149
The whole crew comes

01:37:01.233 --> 01:37:03.235
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:05.987
That's why you're, um,
dressed like Molly Ringwald.

01:37:06.071 --> 01:37:08.031
What? No, I'm not
in my Halloween costume yet.

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:09.115

- No, no.

01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:12.661
No, no, this year, your mom and I
are going as Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:13.828
Huh?

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:16.581

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:18.959
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.294
Sorry.

01:37:21.378 --> 01:37:23.922
I really wanted to be at the Quantum Drop
when you got there,

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:26.049
but I got the time wrong.

01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:29.427
You can invent time travel,
but you can't remember daylight savings.

01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:31.513
I'm glad to know I won't need this.

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:33.473
Oh, my God, you brought a gun?

I didn't know
who was coming out of that ride.

01:37:35.392 --> 01:37:37.978
I waited 35 years
to see who won that fight.

01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:39.938
There's a lot to catch you up on.

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.232
Yeah.

01:37:42.315 --> 01:37:43.984
LAUREN: Everything that's different.

01:37:44.067 --> 01:37:47.571
I-I had to guess at some things obviously,
but I think I got the big stuff.

01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:49.656
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.908
Jason and Veronica are on their way.

01:37:51.992 --> 01:37:53.410
What are you guys doing out here?

01:37:53.493 --> 01:37:56.204
(stammers) Helping her
with some science homework.

01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:57.455
We'll be in in a second.

01:37:57.539 --> 01:37:59.457
Nice fake blood.

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:00.625
- Looks real.
- Thank you.

01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:05.547
Who was that?

01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:10.510
Yeah, so... remember how you were trying
to keep your parents apart in high school?

01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:13.722
You didn't. They got together immediately,

01:38:13.805 --> 01:38:15.974
and that is your 34-year-old brother.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:19.561
(scoffs) Oh, my God,
why does that keep happening?

01:38:19.644 --> 01:38:20.812
And his name is Jamie.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.647
We're both named Jamie?

01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:25.317
Colette, honey,
can you help your brother set the table?

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:29.946
- Yeah, I'll be right in.
- Okay.

01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:31.323
Oh, and your grandmother called.

01:38:31.406 --> 01:38:33.867
She sends her love and she can't wait
to see you at Thanksgiving.

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:35.660
Mm.

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:38.413
You better get to reading.

01:38:38.496 --> 01:38:40.332
Yeah.

01:38:40.415 --> 01:38:42.250
(laughs)

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:46.004
(sighs)

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:48.298
Fucking time travel.
