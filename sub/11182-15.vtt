01:19.447 --> 01:20.581
Hi.

01:23.016 --> 01:27.788
How could somebody with such
big feet move around with
such little bit of noise?

01:27.855 --> 01:30.891
How could somebody with such
a tiny head have
such a big mouth?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.198
-What you doing up so late?
-Can't sleep.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.066
What's the matter?
You lose your teddy bear?

01:40.968 --> 01:44.605
No, but you're gonna lose
your job if you
don't knock it off.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.007
What you doing going into the
kitchen this time of night?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.643
-I gotta turn out the light.
-The light ain't on
in the kitchen.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.413
It will be when I open
the refrigerator.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.341
LOUISE: George!

02:22.743 --> 02:24.144
(WHISTLING)

02:26.046 --> 02:28.549
George, aren't you coming
to bed?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.351
Oh, hi, Weezy.
I'll be there in a minute.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.953
-It's early yet.
-It's after midnight.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.789
After midnight?
Ha! Boy, time sure does fly

02:35.856 --> 02:37.024
when you're right
in the middle of a good book.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.197
A School Girl's Guide
to Dressmaking

02:45.499 --> 02:49.337
George, this book is from
my grammar school
sewing class.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.272
I know that, Weez.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.741
Well, why are you reading
about hem stitching?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.843
Because I'm in
the cleaning business Weezy.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.546
I can never learn too much
about clothes.

02:58.612 --> 03:03.484
You know, George, you've been
burning an awful lot of
midnight oil, lately.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.353
Say what?

03:05.419 --> 03:08.422
It seems like you've been
staying up every night
till I'm asleep.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.624
What do you mean by that?

03:10.691 --> 03:13.193
Well the way you're acting,
one might think you
don't wanna come to bed.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.795
What do you mean by that?

03:14.862 --> 03:18.332
-I mean, what do you mean
by that?
-Huh?

03:18.399 --> 03:20.000
What, do you think I'm trying
to hide something?

03:20.067 --> 03:22.135
You say I'm afraid to come
to bed. I mean...

03:22.202 --> 03:25.973
Look, Weezy,
everything is fine.
Just don't worry about it.

03:26.039 --> 03:30.844
-What would there
be to worry about?
-Like I said, nothing.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.981
George, you're
being ridiculous.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.318
I'm going to bed.
You can stay up till
New Year's, if you want.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.120
Oh, come on, Weezy, look.
I didn't mean nothing.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.189
You go to bed,
I'll be there
in a couple of minutes.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.492
You're sure you don't wanna
come now?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.827
No. I wanna finish reading
that last chapter.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.363
Of course, George,
anything you say.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.801
You're sure there's nothing
I can do?

03:53.867 --> 03:58.906
-What do you mean by that?
-Oh, forget it, George!
Goodnight!

03:58.972 --> 04:03.210
Goodnight! And don't wait up,
this is a long chapter!

04:03.277 --> 04:06.213
Well, I'm going to bed.
You ain't gonna see me
no more till morning.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.316
I hope not.

04:08.382 --> 04:12.653
And if I catch you sneaking
again, I'm gonna hang a bell
your neck.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.790
That's all right.
It'll match the ball and chain
you got around my leg.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.247
Ms. Jefferson?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.616
-Yeah?
-That's a cactus,
not a seaweed.

04:42.683 --> 04:47.555
Oh, what?
I guess my mind's
on other things.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.690
You worried about
Mr. Jefferson
not sleeping lately?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.926
Yes. I'm afraid
he has insomnia.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.263
Well, it's gonna get worse if
he don't get some sleep.

05:04.171 --> 05:09.443
You know, I think we have a
pair of ear plugs in our
bathroom cabinet.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.512
Ear plugs?

05:11.579 --> 05:14.982
What George needs is
absolute quiet.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.886
Well, if you want absolute
quiet, don't plug his ears,
plug his mouth.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.659
(WHISTLING)

05:27.395 --> 05:29.296
(SCATTING)

05:29.363 --> 05:31.031
Here, Florence, put these
in the cupboard.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.134
That's an awful lot of pills.
You must have a big headache.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.969
Yeah. You.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.375
Vitamin E?

05:41.442 --> 05:44.344
Yeah.
E is supposed to build
a man up.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.213
Well, if you're gonna try
to build up that puny
little body,

05:46.279 --> 05:48.882
you need the whole alphabet.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.652
(BELL RINGING)

05:51.719 --> 05:54.121
Put those away.
I'll get the door.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.628
These oysters arrived for you,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.295
-Thanks, Ralph.
Put them right there.
-Yes, sir.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.665
I rushed them up here
as quickly as I could.

06:04.732 --> 06:08.201
-I didn't want them to spoil.
-You didn't have to rush.
They're packed in ice.

06:08.268 --> 06:11.872
Oh. But if I didn't hurry,
the ice would have melted.

06:11.939 --> 06:17.044
-Oh.
-And of course, I had to take
the back stairs, too.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.313
-To keep out of sight.
-Why'd you have to do that?

06:20.380 --> 06:24.017
Well, sir, you know some
oysters have pearls in them.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.688
I had to take precaution
against being hijacked
on the way up here.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.357
Oh. You think these oysters
got pearls in them?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.959
-Of course.
-Oh.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.197
Here you go. Keep the change.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.605
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

06:49.042 --> 06:52.212
-What do you want?
-Uh, well, I'm preparing
a Chinese dinner,

06:52.279 --> 06:54.882
and I was wondering if I
might borrow some peanut oil.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.219
We don't use peanut oil.
Our peanuts don't squeak.
Ha-ha.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.522
I, uh, I see that you're
having oysters.

07:01.589 --> 07:04.091
Your know Oysters Rockefeller
is one of my favorites.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.561
Oh, yeah? Well money
Rockefeller is one
of mine.

07:07.628 --> 07:11.064
You know, of course,
that uh, oysters
are an aphrodisiac.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.702
I sure wouldn't buy no
honky-disiac.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.105
No, I mean that oysters are
supposed to be
a sexual stimulant.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.941
I didn't know that.
I always bought 'em
for the flavor.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.676
Oh, I never knew you were
an oyster lover.

07:22.743 --> 07:26.346
Oh, sure. I've been loving
oysters for years. Huh!

07:26.413 --> 07:30.183
-What's that?
-What do they look like?
Oysters. Here.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.885
What am I supposed
to do with these?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.588
-Take them in the kitchen
and roast them.
-Roast them?

07:34.655 --> 07:37.491
Well, barbecue them.
I like them both ways.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.028
You know, there are all kinds
of aphrodisiacs.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.864
I had an uncle who, uh,
was stationed in India.

07:43.931 --> 07:48.268
He used to swear
by powdered rhinoceros horn.
He ate great quantities of it.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.038
-Oh yeah?
Did it pep up his love life?
-Oh yes, indeed.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.641
Although there was one
unfortunate side effect.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.511
Every spring he went berserk
and tore up a sofa
with his nose.

07:59.647 --> 08:03.116
Oh, hello, Mr. Bentley.
Is there something
I can do you?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.586
Thank you, Mrs. J.
I wanted to borrow
some peanut oil.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.221
Uh, Penelope and I are dining
at my place tonight.

08:08.288 --> 08:11.091
-Oh, it's in the kitchen.
Florence will give it to you.
-Oh, thank you.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.426
Tonight I plan to make a
Cantonese duck.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.230
Oh, how you gonna do that?
Throw a rock at his head?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.633
Oh, that's very funny, Mr. J.
I must remember that.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.469
How do you make
duck Cantonese?
Throw a rock at its head.

08:22.536 --> 08:26.239
Uh. That's very funny.
I don't know why,
but it's very funny.

08:28.709 --> 08:33.113
I know one thing. You can't
make a Cantonese duck
out of an English turkey.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.183
Uh, George, can I talk to you
about something?

08:36.249 --> 08:40.020
-Sure, Weezy, anything.
-It's about your not coming
to bed nights.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.522
-Some other time, Weezy.
-Oh, why not now?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.992
-(BELL RINGING)
-Well, because
I gotta answer door.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.059
(WHISTLING)

08:48.962 --> 08:51.699
Helen, come in.
Good to see you.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.467
-Here, talk to Louise.
-Well, I really can't stay.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.504
Why not?
You always stayed before.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.808
That's only because
I can't resist your
charming personality.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.211
I know. Nobody can.

09:04.277 --> 09:08.081
-Louise, would you like two
tickets to the ballet tonight?
-You and Tom aren't going?

09:08.148 --> 09:12.319
No. Tom and I are having a
candle light dinner
at home tonight.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.188
-Alone.
-Oh.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.826
Oh, Louise, Tom is in one of
his romantic moods again.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.462
-He's a real tiger.
-Oh!

09:22.529 --> 09:24.865
A tiger?
That overstuffed mouse?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.902
It's like our honeymoon all
over again.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.172
In the last week,
we've worn out three
Johnny Mathis records.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.240
Oh.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.145
Uh, why? What's got into Tom?

09:38.211 --> 09:42.315
I don't know.
But whatever it is,
I ain't gonna fight it.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.785
-I'll be right back.
-Uh, George,
where are you going?

09:44.852 --> 09:47.254
-Up to see my good friend Tom.
-Your what?

09:47.320 --> 09:50.557
My ace boon coon.
I ain't seen my old buddy
in a long time.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.593
-You saw him yesterday.
-Like I said, we got a lot of
catching up to do.

09:53.661 --> 09:57.197
But look,
just make yourself at home.
Talk as much as you want.

09:57.264 --> 10:01.368
-Well, what's got into him?
-I wish I knew.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.437
He's been acting
very strange, lately.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.474
Well, what do you say, Louise?
Can you use these
ballet tickets?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.076
Thanks, Helen,
but I don't think so.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.479
I'm gonna try to get George
to sleep early tonight.

10:12.545 --> 10:16.950
Excuse me, but did I overhear
you say you had extra tickets
for the ballet tonight?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.887
Two of them, Mr. Bentley,
free of charge.
Can you use them?

10:19.953 --> 10:23.190
Oh yes, indeed.
Thank you. You're sure you
won't regret it?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.925
(GIGGLES) No way.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.061
Well, thanks again.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.497
And, uh, may I say on behalf
of Penelope and myself,

10:30.563 --> 10:33.233
that it looks like a fowl
evening ahead.

10:33.300 --> 10:38.071
-A fowl evening?
-Yes, the Cantonese duck
followed by Swan Lake .

10:38.138 --> 10:39.172
Oh!

10:42.776 --> 10:44.111
(SINGING)

10:48.015 --> 10:50.150
Damn, I should have made
that one.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.153
Look, I wanna talk
to you man to man.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.289
-Sure. Go ahead. What is it?
-I mean, straightforward.
No beating around the bush.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.192
Oh. How do you like that?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.795
I think this floor breaks
to the right.

11:01.862 --> 11:04.832
Damn it, Willis,
I'm trying to talk to you and
you're talking to the floor.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.868
-Will you listen to me?
-I am listening.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.937
Look, I wanna ask you
a question and
I want a straight answer.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.205
Go ahead, what is it?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.974
What's your secret?

11:17.577 --> 11:20.113
Well, actually,
it's all in the grip.

11:27.554 --> 11:30.157
-Huh?
-You see I have
this overlapping, um.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.559
Oh, not that dummy.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.864
-Oh, I thought you
were talking about golf.
-No, I'm, uh.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.466
More like, uh, baseball.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.302
Baseball?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.872
Yeah, you know like, uh...
Well, take Reggie Jackson
for instance.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.441
When he comes up to the plate,
he swings and strikes out.
Right?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.477
But the next time he
hits a home run, right?

11:50.543 --> 11:54.081
-Right. Or he could foul out.
-Damn it,
I don't wanna foul out!

11:56.283 --> 11:57.684
What?

11:57.751 --> 12:00.553
-That's my problem.
-Your problem is not
fouling out.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.623
No, my problem is not getting
up to the plate.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.262
George, what are
you talking about?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.131
Well, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

12:11.198 --> 12:13.666
Uh, Willis, uh.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.904
Did you ever have
any trouble in bed?

12:16.970 --> 12:20.707
Gee, I don't think so.
Not since I was
potty trained, anyway.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.649
I don't mean that kind
of trouble, you dumb turkey.
I mean, uh...

12:30.483 --> 12:32.119
Well, you know.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.988
-Oh, you mean that kind
of trouble.
-Right.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.024
Never.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.995
-Why do you ask?
-Oh, well, cause, uh,

12:42.062 --> 12:44.364
you know, this friend of mine,
he's got that problem.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.867
Naturally, I don't know
nothing about that.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.568
So I figured I'd ask you.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.703
Why doesn't your friend
talk with his doctor?

12:51.905 --> 12:54.107
-Well, cause he doesn't
wanna worry him.
-Huh?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.543
Well, you know it's
the family doctor.
He's an old friend.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.513
-Oh, oh, I understand.
-Yeah, so he'd rather
see a stranger.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.684
You know any strange doctors?

13:04.751 --> 13:08.188
I do know a doctor who
specializes in that
kind of problem.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.857
-Dr. Beamish.
-Hey, that's great.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.591
Why don't you give me
Dr. Beamish's phone number?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.760
And I'll pass it on
to my friend

13:13.827 --> 13:15.362
(CLEARS THROAT AND LAUGHS)

13:15.428 --> 13:18.531
Oh, I see, it's here.
Hi, Helen.

13:18.598 --> 13:22.169
-Tom was just teaching me
how to putt.
-Oh, George, you poor man.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.604
Look, he ain't that bad
of a teacher.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.041
-No, Louise just told me
all about your problem.
-What?

13:38.485 --> 13:42.089
-Helen, look.
-Oh, that's all right, George.
It's only an inexpensive vase.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.391
No, I ain't talking about
that. What did Louise
tell you?

13:44.457 --> 13:46.994
About the problem
you've been having.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.496
What problem?

13:49.562 --> 13:53.133
-Why the one you've
been having at night.
-You mean she knows?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.735
Of course she knows.
Even I can tell.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
-You can?
-Uh, look, Helen,
why don't we...

14:03.243 --> 14:04.777
Wait. No, no, no, no.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.779
What do you mean you can tell?

14:06.846 --> 14:10.050
George, anybody can tell
that you're suffering
from insomnia.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.385
Oh, oh, yeah, that problem.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.125
No wonder she's upset.
Look how irritable you are.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.561
Yeah, I know.
It's just not like me.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.064
Well anyways, look, let me
get back downstairs.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.666
Look, I'll call you later,
you get me
Dr. Beamish's number.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.800
-Okay?
-Sure, George.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.604
-Dr. Beamish?
-Oh, oh, yeah.
Uh, he's a vet.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.075
You know, animal doctor.
Leroy's got this sick cat.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.777
See y'all later.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.084
Tom, is that the same
Dr. Beamish I know?
The psychiatrist?

14:44.151 --> 14:48.088
Yes, you see it's not
just insomnia.
It's their sex life.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.657
George is worried about
his lack of drive.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.727
Oh, Louise never said anything
to me about that.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.030
I don't think
she even noticed.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.669
Wouldn't something like that
be hard to miss?

15:02.735 --> 15:06.306
But Louise thinks
it's insomnia.
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.476
And I'll look up
Dr. Beamish's phone number
for George.

15:09.542 --> 15:14.881
Oh, Tom, wait a minute, um.
We don't have to rush.

15:14.948 --> 15:20.020
-Huh?
-Well, Doctor Beamish won't be
in until tomorrow. Right?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.354
Well, yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.656
Put on a Johnny Mathis record.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.701
Mr. Jefferson?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.204
Oh, man, I hate to see
the bill I'm gonna
get for all of this.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.738
What do you mean?

15:38.805 --> 15:41.141
I've never seen a doctor with
so many secretaries.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.411
One lady shows me in here, and
now here you come to take me
someplace else.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.646
Well, let's go see old
Dr. Beamish.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.615
I'm old Dr. Beamish.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.852
-You're jiving?
You're a doctor?
-A real doctor.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.122
Got a diploma and a Mercedes.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.858
Yeah, well I was expecting
a man.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.393
I don't wanna strip down
in front of no woman.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.664
Oh, I'm not that kind of a
doctor. I'm a psychiatrist.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.699
Yeah, but see, I was just
expecting a regular doctor.

16:06.766 --> 16:10.670
You know,
a man with a white robe
and earphones around his neck.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.574
A pocket full of
those popsicle sticks
to look down your throat.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.479
-You ain't even got a scale.
-Mr. Jefferson,
I examine your mind.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.881
But my head is not where
the problem is.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.385
That dumb Willis.
He don't know one end
from the other.

16:27.454 --> 16:31.324
Why don't you just sit down
and tell me what
your problem is?

16:31.391 --> 16:32.925
-Tell you?
-Yes.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.828
Um.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.465
Well, uh. Okay.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.604
Well sometimes at night, when,
I mean, uh. Well, uh.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.406
Oh yeah, you know like in
the Bible,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.975
when a snake gives
Adam and Eve an apple
and turns them both on?

16:49.042 --> 16:51.178
Mmm-hmm.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.614
Well that same snake could
give me and my wife
a whole barrel of apples,

16:54.681 --> 16:57.350
and nothing would happen.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.353
Oh, you mean Mrs. Jefferson
is unresponsive.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.656
No, it's not her. It's me.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.560
-Uh, I've just been hitting
a lot of foul balls lately.
-What?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.530
Well,

17:10.597 --> 17:12.532
in other words,
it's been a month,

17:12.599 --> 17:14.667
since old Cupid zapped
one of those arrows
into our bedroom.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.903
Oh well, that's not unusual.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.207
-And a week before that.
-Also not unheard of.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.110
Yeah, but I don't know when
the last time was I turned out
the light and,

17:23.176 --> 17:25.245
heard Weezy say those
three little words.

17:25.312 --> 17:28.215
-I love you?
-No. I got a headache.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.785
I think I understand.

17:32.852 --> 17:38.558
Tell me, Mr. Jefferson,
have you had any special
business problems lately?

17:38.625 --> 17:41.361
Well, yeah, I've been having
a lot of trouble with
the store in Queens.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.763
There. You see?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.533
-No, what?
-It's stress, Mr. Jefferson.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.269
Yours is a very common
complaint with men.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.870
Yeah. Old men.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.540
No. Age has very little
to do with it.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.342
Mmm-hmm. That's what you say.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.811
As I said, Mr. Jefferson,
yours is a very
common complaint.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.814
But it's almost
always temporary. It'll pass.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.684
-Yeah, but when?
-Well, as soon as you get rid
of the stress,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.887
you'll probably go back
to being your old self again.

18:07.954 --> 18:11.458
Oh, you mean, when I stop
worrying about the store in
Queens, my problem will end?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.193
I wouldn't be
at all surprised.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.129
But I could have trouble with
that store for a whole year.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.366
I need help, quick!

18:19.432 --> 18:23.436
Well, there are other ways
to solve your
marital difficulties.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.305
Yeah? Well, what are they?

18:25.372 --> 18:28.875
If all else fails, you might
consider a surrogate.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.544
A lawyer? We don't wanna
get divorced.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.714
No, a, a sexual surrogate.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.116
Say what?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.919
A trained woman.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.223
Trained in what?

18:45.558 --> 18:49.762
Well, with her you have
talking and touching,
and uh,

18:49.829 --> 18:53.966
ultimately the full
romantic experience.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.135
-You mean, me and her will...
-With her you'll do what,

18:56.203 --> 18:59.539
you're afraid to do,
until you do it right.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.941
-Are you jiving?
-I jive you not.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.346
-But I'm married.
-So is she.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.880
Shame on her!

19:10.983 --> 19:13.119
All right, Mr. Jefferson,
it's up to you.

19:13.186 --> 19:16.389
But if you change your mind,
I can call and make
an appointment for you.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.958
Are you kidding?
You're asking me
to cheat on my wife?

19:19.025 --> 19:21.828
No, it's not cheating.
It's called therapy.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.597
Huh! Not where I grew up
it ain't.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.734
You should have your mouth
washed out with soap.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.438
Some doctor you are!

19:31.504 --> 19:34.507
Marcus Welby would never tell
a guy to do
something like that.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.582
(BELL RINGING)

19:46.619 --> 19:49.356
-George!
-He dribbled out
of Charlie's bar.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.125
Oh, bring him in, Ralph.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.061
I ain't no good, Weez.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.268
I almost went
to a demonstrator.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.336
Don't worry. I didn't go.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.007
I passed out before
I got outta the bar.

20:08.074 --> 20:11.110
-You what?
-I said.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.045
(SLURRY)
Nobody knows...

20:15.214 --> 20:17.250
The trouble I see.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.620
I had to lift him off
the sidewalk in order to get
him to his feet.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.556
-Oh, that was nice
of you, Ralph.
-Then dust him off.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.992
He was covered with dust
and stuff.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.761
-Here, Ralph.
-Thank you, ma'am.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.731
Say, you got
a little extra coming.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.534
-Would you like me
to carry something or...
-No, no.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.570
-Move a little chair around?
-Uh, no, no, Ralph.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.472
You can make up
the difference
some other time.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.342
Yes, ma'am.
And I'll remember. Yes, ma'am.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.716
(SLURRY) No.

20:53.019 --> 20:57.023
Now that's a dude that's been
sipping the sauce.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.859
It's not his fault.
He's got a problem.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.862
Oh, yeah?
What kind of problem?

21:02.929 --> 21:05.832
Oh, never mind. Helen Willis
told me all about it.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.469
-(SLURRY)
I ain't the man I used to be.
-That's good news.

21:11.270 --> 21:15.975
Florence, please.
Oh, I think I've got an idea.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.379
Florence, give me a hand
getting Mr. Jefferson
into the bedroom.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.548
Hurry before he wakes up.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.615
(SNORING)

21:45.472 --> 21:49.809
Okay. Now hold him.
Hold him up,
while I take his clothes off.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.411
I won't either!

21:55.548 --> 21:59.318
-Florence, this is no time
for modesty, I need your help!
-I'm sorry.

21:59.386 --> 22:03.723
Two things I don't do.
Windows and zippers.

22:06.926 --> 22:11.230
Just cover your eyes
and be careful.
He's a light sleeper.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.265
All right. But hurry up.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.675
Florence, he's waking up.
I have to go in the bathroom
and change.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.877
Hurry. Help me finish
undressing him.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.779
-I can't do that,
Ms. Jefferson.
-Why not?

22:26.846 --> 22:29.081
Cause I'm gonna be in my room
with the door locked.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.683
Well, but wait.

23:03.850 --> 23:04.851
(SNORING)

23:26.906 --> 23:30.643
-George? George? Wake up!
-Huh?

23:34.413 --> 23:37.917
-What happened?
-Oh, don't be so modest.

23:37.984 --> 23:42.489
-Say what?
-You know what I'm talking
about, you tiger.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.124
Tiger?

23:47.093 --> 23:50.963
-You mean...
-George, you were wonderful.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.065
Huh? I was that good, huh?

23:56.969 --> 23:59.972
Good? You came through
like a champ.

24:00.039 --> 24:04.176
Oh. You mean like
Reggie Jackson hitting
a home run in the ninth?

24:04.243 --> 24:07.446
-Better.
-Goodnight, George.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.915
Goodnight? What are you
talking about, Weezy?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.283
This game's going
into extra inning.

24:45.451 --> 24:49.255
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:50.456 --> 24:53.159
* Movin', movin' on up
