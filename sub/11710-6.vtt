00:03.086 --> 00:03.711
What are you doing?

00:03.711 --> 00:06.714
Oh, I like to fill up
each little waffle hole

00:06.714 --> 00:09.217
with syrup.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.218
[LAUGHS]

00:10.218 --> 00:10.802
Really?

00:10.802 --> 00:13.805
This is gonna be happening
for the rest of our lives?

00:13.805 --> 00:16.016
Well, how do you do it?

00:20.353 --> 00:23.565
Ha. You missed three holes.

00:25.317 --> 00:25.983
Hey, you guys.

00:25.983 --> 00:27.652
Two coffees to go,
please.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.821
Hey, Adam, I'm
heading downtown

00:29.821 --> 00:30.988
to a sports apparel warehouse.

00:30.988 --> 00:33.991
A buddy of mine works there,
and he hooks me up.

00:33.991 --> 00:34.784
You got any requests?

00:34.784 --> 00:37.162
I could use
a new hooded sweatshirt.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.121
You got it.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.082
Might be slightly irregular.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.083
Slightly.
Yeah.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.752
The last t-shirt
you got from that guy
gave you a rash.

00:44.752 --> 00:47.004
We don't know
it was the t-shirt.

00:47.004 --> 00:49.716
I was in several
hot tubs that week.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.469
See you guys later.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.013
Hey, what's up, Kong?

00:56.013 --> 00:59.892
Whatever it is that makes you
feel safe enough

00:59.892 --> 01:02.895
to call me names like that...

01:02.895 --> 01:04.481
shouldn't.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.860
Hey. Nice outfit,
9 to 5.

01:08.860 --> 01:14.366
You're certainly dressed
to make 70% of what a man
in your position would make.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.826
[LAUGHS]
You should know.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.121
You're 70% of a man.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.083
Oh, that backfired nicely.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.418
All right. Scootch.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.878
I got a question, you guys.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.548
Do you think I'm...
pale?

01:30.548 --> 01:31.758
Yes.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.218
You're almost clear.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.762
Why do you ask?

01:35.762 --> 01:38.348
Because there's
a school near the newsstand

01:38.348 --> 01:40.142
where I usually buyThe Times.

01:40.142 --> 01:40.892
You read thePost.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.520
Well, can I just
tell the story?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.648
Anyway, there's a new teacher
looking over recess,

01:46.648 --> 01:49.567
and as you know
from my MySpace page,

01:49.567 --> 01:50.943
I have a thing for teachers.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.613
You have a thing
for all women.

01:53.613 --> 01:57.074
Not all.
Okay, all.

01:57.074 --> 02:00.995
Anyway, so today,
we make a little eye contact.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.539
She gives me the little smile.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.792
And I walk over
to break-a the ice-a,

02:05.792 --> 02:10.880
and some, you know,
jerk starts insulting me
out of nowhere.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.714
It threw off my game.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.384
Okay, well who was it?
Another teacher?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.969
No, I don't think
it was a teacher.

02:16.969 --> 02:17.470
No?

02:17.429 --> 02:20.140
Uh, the principal,
the custodian.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.351
No, it was--
it was a punk.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.270
[LAUGHS]

02:25.270 --> 02:25.978
A punk?

02:25.978 --> 02:29.357
What? One of the children?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.318
Was he bigger than you?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.487
What? It's a valid question.

02:34.487 --> 02:39.409
Look, I'll give you
he was small-er-ish.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.412
But quite mean.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.331
He called me things.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.584
Like Milk Face.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.586
Albino Boy.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.086
Casper.

02:50.002 --> 02:56.218
Said the pigment factory
called, and my application
was denied.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.553
Pigment factory.
That's a good one.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.346
He could
have also said,

02:59.346 --> 03:04.351
"Hey, look it's
a little powdered
donut hole."

03:04.976 --> 03:07.687
That was a sweet pep talk.
Thank you.

My money's on the bully.

will you help me
put the couch back

[GROANS]

04:16.172 --> 04:17.549
Oh, what happened?

04:17.549 --> 04:18.633
Ah, nothing.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.719
It's just a little twinge
in my shoulder.

04:21.719 --> 04:22.470
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.139
Let me massage it,
see if I can loosen it up.

04:25.139 --> 04:25.682
I...

04:25.682 --> 04:29.977
I'm not a big
people-touching-me guy.

04:29.977 --> 04:32.397
I studied massage.
I know what I'm doing.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.900
Ah, still.
Touching.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.777
Come on.
I insist.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.823
Okay, sure.

[SIGHS]

04:44.241 --> 04:45.368
Oh, here's the problem.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.994
There's a knot
in your trapezius

04:46.994 --> 04:49.289
that's putting pressure
on a nerve.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.332
Oh...

04:50.332 --> 04:52.500
I think it's
loosening up there.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.877
Yeah, the knot's
disappearing.

04:54.877 --> 04:55.837
So's the tension.

If you ever get tired
with graphic design,

04:59.131 --> 05:01.343
you could do this
for a living.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.261
Well, I did work
for a physical therapy clinic

05:04.261 --> 05:07.724
for a summer after college,
and--oh!

05:07.724 --> 05:10.142
What?
Oh, no.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.823
All right, well, uh,
the rug looks great.

No problem. I don't know what
Jennifer's talking about.

than all these kids.

Ooh, there she is.

What did you use in your hair?
Two cans of mousse?

- [LAUGHS]
- No.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.092

of gel.

06:25.092 --> 06:26.385
The recommended amount.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.970
What? Do you keep it
in your purse?

06:27.970 --> 06:30.432
With the rest of your
makeup and lotion?

06:30.432 --> 06:31.849
Oh, ka-zing.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.726
Look, I don't have a purse
or makeup.

06:33.726 --> 06:37.647
And I only use lotion
because I have
combination skin.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.398
A combination
of girl and sissy.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.402

I'm gonna talk to the teacher.

his eyelashes are.

With what?

You're holding
your neck.

07:22.399 --> 07:25.737
It's nothing.
Just a twinge.

07:25.737 --> 07:26.488
How did it happen?

07:26.488 --> 07:30.282
Out of nowhere.
Caused by nothing.

07:30.282 --> 07:31.200
Okay.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.368
I know what
you're up to.

- You do?
- Oh, yes I do.

to rub your neck.

'Cause every time I do,

07:38.500 --> 07:41.210
somehow it leads to sex.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.675
Yeah, it wasn't exactly
The Da Vinci Code.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.261
It's all right.
I don't mind.

It's our little dance.

and go straight to
the back of the limo.

- Come on.
- Wait.

no means no.

Oh, you're
using the elevator?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.149
Oh, I left the stove
on fire.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.534
Who is it?

08:54.534 --> 08:59.747
It's Audrey. The person
whose face you just
slammed the door on.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.667
I'm sorry. I didn't
see you behind me.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.252
Yeah, I was yelling,
"Hey, Jen."

09:06.838 --> 09:08.965
What the hell is going on?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.508
Jeff is acting super-weird.

09:11.508 --> 09:12.468
You are acting weird.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.469
What--what's going on?

09:13.469 --> 09:16.848
So, Jeff didn't tell you
about the thing?

09:16.848 --> 09:19.266
No. No, he didn't.
Why don't you?

09:19.266 --> 09:21.936
This is funny.
You're going to laugh.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.438
I like to laugh.

09:24.438 --> 09:28.776
Okay, earlier Jeff helped me
lift the couch back
onto the rug.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.069
It's the rug I got
at ABC Carpet.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.488

because we're friends.

I massaged it.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.875
- He felt much better.
- So?

09:43.875 --> 09:49.839
Well, he felt so much better,
he gave me a standing ovation.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.009
Without standing up.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.012
Oh, wait--what?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.805
I used to do
therapeutic massage.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.931
This happened all the time.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.267
I don't think
it's a good time

10:01.267 --> 10:04.061
for you to brag about
how good you are.

10:04.061 --> 10:04.979
No, no.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.480
It's a physiological response.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.399
Completely innocent
and accidental.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.566
I was hoping Jeff
would tell you,

10:09.566 --> 10:12.654
and it would be worked out,
and I wouldn't be involved.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.529
Oh ho ho, you're involved.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.574
You got involved
the second you started
rubbing my husband.

10:17.574 --> 10:18.367
Only because his neck hurt.

10:18.367 --> 10:22.538
You don't think I was
really trying to make a move
on him, do you?

10:22.538 --> 10:26.000
No, no, I don't.
I'm just...mad.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.835
Why didn't he
just tell me?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.963
He probably didn't know
how to bring it up.

10:30.963 --> 10:31.964
Yeah, yeah.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.051
I guess he needs
your help for that.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.263
Sorry, still kinda mad.

10:39.263 --> 10:39.764
Look...

10:39.681 --> 10:41.098
I'm sure he's
just embarrassed.

10:41.098 --> 10:45.061
He's probably
trying to figure out
how to tell you right now.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.520
Yeah, probably.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.398
I'll give him
a chance to be honest.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.900
How are you
gonna tell Adam?

10:50.900 --> 10:54.486
Same way I always
break bad news to him.

10:54.486 --> 10:56.864
Naked.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.591
Hey, Gigantor.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.592
I'm glad you're here.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.219
I could use a little
man to man talk.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.098
And fortunately,
you're a little man.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.558
Ah, the empire strikes back.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.351
Hey, help me out here.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.477
I'm meeting this teacher
for coffee.

11:26.477 --> 11:30.689
I'm trying to decide which
shirt color would make me
look the least pale.

11:30.689 --> 11:34.151
What do you think?
Ash, slate, or ecru?

11:34.151 --> 11:37.154
I'm going to change the topic
now.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.614
You get massages, right?

11:38.614 --> 11:41.784
Say no more.
Listen...

11:41.784 --> 11:43.619
Her name's Katya.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.329
From Russia with love.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.166
Tell her the man
with the golden gun
sent ya.

11:50.001 --> 11:53.462
No, no. I was just wondering
if while getting a massage,

11:53.462 --> 11:54.213
you ever...

11:54.213 --> 11:57.299
Chubbed up.
Yeah, all the time. Why?

11:57.299 --> 11:58.968
So, it's normal.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.638
Who's to say
what's normal in this world.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.183
But where did you get it?
And did you get a card?

12:06.183 --> 12:09.145
It wasn't at a massage place.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
It was, uh...

12:11.397 --> 12:14.358
Ah, you trailed off there
mid-sentence.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.069
Didn't finish your thought.
I'm intrigued.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.406
Look, you work with that.
I don't know if I can tell ya.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.783
You don't wanna
tell me anything

12:21.783 --> 12:25.494
when in fact you've
just revealed everything.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.664
I can now deduce
that you got excited

12:28.664 --> 12:31.876
when you got a massage
from Adam.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.920
It was Jennifer.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.548
Duh, yeah, my second guess.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.340
If you tell anyone,

12:38.340 --> 12:40.384
I'm gonna punch my fist
through your chest,

12:40.384 --> 12:43.637
spin you around my forearm
like a pinwheel.

12:43.637 --> 12:49.310
That's terrifying,
yet somehow beautiful.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.062
I got a knot in my shoulder.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.729
And Jennifer offered to help.

12:52.729 --> 12:55.066
And then she rubbed it.
And...

12:55.066 --> 12:58.402
Mmm...ba-boing!

12:58.402 --> 13:02.281
Yeah. Ba-boing.

13:02.281 --> 13:02.781
So whatever.

13:02.739 --> 13:04.450
You got the hots
for your friend's wife.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.453
It's not that.
Now I feel awkward
around Jennifer.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.038
I feel guilty
around Audrey.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.622
I feel like I cheated on her.

13:10.622 --> 13:12.416
But you didn't.
You had no intent.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.877
You had a tent,
but no intent.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.545
I'm just going
to tell Audrey.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.132
- Sure, if you wanna
be selfish about it.
- How's that selfish?

13:20.132 --> 13:23.469
Nothing happened,
and Audrey doesn't
know anything.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.303
But you feel guilty
about it

13:24.303 --> 13:28.640
so you tell Audrey,
she feels bad so you
can feel better.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.767
Ergo--selfish.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.353
How do you know
all this stuff?

13:32.353 --> 13:36.023
Proud Cosmo subscriber
since '93.

13:36.023 --> 13:39.401
It's like having
the other team's playbook.

13:39.401 --> 13:40.402
Fine, I'm not gonna tell her.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.030
I gotta figure out
a way to get rid of
this guilt

13:43.030 --> 13:44.823
because it's making me
tense.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.741
Well, I'd rub your shoulders,

13:45.741 --> 13:49.703
but I don't think
the bottom of this table
could take it.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.502
Oh, hey.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.337
I have something
to tell you.

13:58.337 --> 13:58.921
Hold on.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.174
I've got something
important to ask.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.467
Okay.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.803
Do you think I'm pretty?

14:06.803 --> 14:08.514
If you're gay,
tell me now

14:08.514 --> 14:11.142
because I do not
wanna go through that again.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.726
Go through what again?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.812
Nothing. It doesn't matter.
What's your issue?

14:15.812 --> 14:16.647
That bully.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.358
That bully that teased Russell,
he called me pretty.

14:19.358 --> 14:23.195
Yeah, he said
I had thick, pretty lashes
like a girl.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.615
He said the Miss America
contest called, and I was in.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.491
[LAUGHS]

14:27.491 --> 14:29.535
That's a good one.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.914
Why are you
letting the kid get to you?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.166
Because. Guys don't want
to look pretty.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.626
They want to look rugged
and tough.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.627
You know, and...

14:38.627 --> 14:42.214
Maybe a little deformed.

14:42.214 --> 14:42.714
Yeah.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.927
You're not pretty.
You're handsome.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.344
Ruggedly handsome.

14:47.344 --> 14:51.765
Like a lumberjack.
Or Ryan Seacrest.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.436
You know what
I'm gonna do? Honey?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.645
I should break my nose.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.147
No, you shouldn't.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.691
My nose, my rules.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.904
Anyway, what was that thing
you wanted to tell me?

15:04.904 --> 15:05.947
Oh, well...

15:05.947 --> 15:08.282
Maybe we should
go in the bedroom.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.410
This is funny.
You're gonna laugh.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.085
Hi.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.337
Hey, you're back.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.504
Yeah.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.299
Look, I'm sorry I ran out
of the apartment before,

15:25.299 --> 15:29.011
but, um, I have
an explanation.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.097
- You do?
- Yes.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.265
I'm so glad.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.476
Well, you're going to be
even gladder

15:35.476 --> 15:38.354
because I ran out
to buy you this.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.730
Diamond earrings.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.149
Two of them.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.401
Whoa, those are beautiful.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.238
What did I do
to deserve these?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.656
Or what did you do?

15:49.656 --> 15:54.536
Nothing. Just 'cause
I love ya.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.746
I'm glad you like them.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.164
That makes me feel good.

15:57.164 --> 16:00.417
I'm gonna go get a beer.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.377
Sure you want a beer?

16:01.377 --> 16:05.047
Wouldn't you prefer
a nice, stiff drink?

16:05.047 --> 16:05.631
[LAUGHS]

16:05.631 --> 16:09.385
Maybe some hard liquor.
Straight up.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.680
Well played.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.057
You got the diamonds first.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.933
I don't care
about the diamonds.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.561
Then can I return them?

16:19.561 --> 16:20.187
What do you think?

16:20.187 --> 16:22.606
I think they're
going to look very nice on you

16:22.606 --> 16:24.733
and really bring out
the sparkle in...

16:24.733 --> 16:28.154
[SIGHS]
Let's just do this.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.155
Yes. Yes, let's.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.865
You know this whole thing
could have been avoided

16:31.865 --> 16:33.284
if you didn't try to hide it.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.451
I didn't try
to hide it.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.537
It was gone by the time
I got home.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.999
I mean the fact
that you hid that--

16:39.999 --> 16:40.791
You know what I mean.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.335
By not telling me,
it made you look guilty.

16:43.335 --> 16:43.919
I felt guilty.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.630
That's why I didn't
let you have your way
with me.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.757
Oh, well, you are lucky
you didn't.

16:48.757 --> 16:49.841
Why? Why?
For bachelorette parties

16:49.841 --> 16:53.095
you've gone to those
Chippendales shows
and gotten all worked up.

16:53.095 --> 16:58.267
And I was happy to finish
what those hairless,
oily freaks started.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.603
Yes, yes, but those
hairless, oily freaks

17:01.603 --> 17:03.189
were not our friends
from the building.

17:03.189 --> 17:08.402
I don't know. Carlos in 5A
is suspiciously smooth.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.030
Look, all you had to do
was be honest.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.906
You should know
you can tell me anything.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.283
You would have been fine if
I walked in

17:14.283 --> 17:17.536
and said, "Look what
the cute neighbor girl
gave me"?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.496
[LAUGHS]
Now she's cute?

17:19.496 --> 17:21.915
No-- You just said I could
tell you anything.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.959
Yes, but don't be
stupid about it.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.129
That's my point.
I can't tell you everything.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.340
You can tell me
everything I should know.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.257
If it's
going to upset me,

17:30.257 --> 17:32.301
and it's not important,
then don't tell me.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.596
I thought that's
what I was doing here.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.182
Yes, but I found out.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.267
How is that my fault?

17:41.017 --> 17:43.937
Just don't let
other women rub you.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.356
Done.

17:45.356 --> 17:46.773
Fine.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.237
Are you gonna
keep the earrings?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.571
Oh, yeah.

17:52.571 --> 17:57.243
Easily the most
expensive erection
I've ever had.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.161
If it makes you
feel any better,

17:59.161 --> 18:00.954
it had nothing to do
with Jennifer.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.373
The same thing
happens to me

18:02.373 --> 18:05.959
when I'm riding on a bus
on a bumpy road.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.503
I do feel better.

18:07.503 --> 18:14.050
In fact, I was actually
disappointed when they
repaved 9th Avenue.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.597
[KNOCKING]

18:21.767 --> 18:23.977
All right, pal.
Jennifer told me what happened.

18:23.977 --> 18:27.898
Now let's step outside
and settle this like men.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.984
If you could,
aim for my nose.

18:33.945 --> 18:35.322
Ow!

18:35.322 --> 18:39.660
[WHINING]
Thank you.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.205
Let's see what this
little bully has to say now.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.333
Oh, yeah, we're looking good.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.044
Very good.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.631
[LAUGHS]

18:54.300 --> 18:56.677
Wow, where do I start?

18:56.677 --> 18:57.886
Yeah?

18:57.886 --> 18:59.555
Not so pretty now,
am I?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.516
No, but you will be
when your nose job heals.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.850
Who are you, Ashlee Simpson?

19:03.850 --> 19:07.438
For your information,
I got this from a man.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.440
Oh, so you like it rough?

19:09.440 --> 19:14.570
- Ka-zing.
- What are you laughing at,
Pumpkin Face?

19:14.570 --> 19:15.904
- Oh.
- Willy Wonka called.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.574
He said he needs
his chocolate stirred.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.074
[LAUGHS]

19:18.990 --> 19:21.034
He said you're
an Oompah Loompah.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.744
I've seen the film.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.037
You know what,
I feel sorry for you.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.499
I think if you had any friends,
you wouldn't be over here

19:27.499 --> 19:28.041
making fun of us.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.962
I was just voted
most popular in my class,
jackass.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.672
Prove it, jackass.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.882
Russell?

19:35.882 --> 19:36.842
[MOCK CRYING]

19:36.842 --> 19:41.555
Miss O'Brien, the orange man
called me a bad name.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.724
It's bronzer.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.851
Russell, what is the matter
with you?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.228
He's just a child.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.354
He started it.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.939
I don't care who started it.
You should leave.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.066
- What?
- And see a doctor.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.026
You may have hepatitis.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.031
Ka-zing.

20:00.031 --> 20:02.326
Ka-pow.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.707
Happen yet?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.252
Not yet.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.378
Come on.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.381
Don't start pressuring me.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.384
Wait, I have an idea.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.135
Ninth Avenue line.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.346
Next stop, Times Square.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.599
That's the stuff.
Now gimme a pothole.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.934
There you go!
