The buzzfinger homepage.

00:42.202 --> 00:45.171
Poor Jay Leno.

00:45.205 --> 00:47.607
No, under that.

00:49.343 --> 00:50.276
That's you and Alyssa Vaughn,

00:50.310 --> 00:51.534
Together.

00:51.568 --> 00:53.712
No way!

00:53.746 --> 00:54.174
That's Beck

00:54.208 --> 00:56.739
And Alyssa Vaughn, together.

00:56.773 --> 00:57.271
why are you guys

00:57.305 --> 00:57.969
So impressed?

00:58.004 --> 00:58.637
'cause Alyssa Vaughn

00:58.671 --> 00:59.436
Is famous.

00:59.470 --> 01:00.336
and hot.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.235
her father's a billionaire.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.868
and hot.

01:03.902 --> 01:06.104
Ah, I didn't mean her father is.

01:06.139 --> 01:08.913
I drank fish pee.

01:08.948 --> 01:10.714
explain this.

01:10.748 --> 01:12.380
she's in my yoga class.

01:12.415 --> 01:13.414
Some paparazzi showed up

01:13.448 --> 01:14.280
And took that pic,

01:14.314 --> 01:15.980
But we're just friends.

01:16.815 --> 01:17.814
And how did Jade react

01:17.849 --> 01:18.380
When she found out

01:18.414 --> 01:19.079
You were friends

01:19.114 --> 01:21.281
With Alyssa Vaughn?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.915
Jade was cool with it.

01:23.951 --> 01:26.254
She threw a rock at me.

01:26.288 --> 01:27.354
yeah, well I'd be careful,

01:27.389 --> 01:28.090
'cause I don't think

01:28.124 --> 01:28.724
Jade's the type

01:28.758 --> 01:30.759
To be okay with...

01:30.794 --> 01:32.660
attention!

01:32.694 --> 01:35.794
Attention everyone!

01:35.828 --> 01:39.165
Stop while I talk.

01:39.199 --> 01:43.504
As you all know, I'm Trina vega.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.439
Now, if you look at the flyers

01:45.473 --> 01:47.709
That just landed on you,

01:47.743 --> 01:48.510
You'll see that starting

01:48.545 --> 01:49.746
This Friday night,

01:49.780 --> 01:50.747
I will be performing

01:53.584 --> 01:54.951
With an exclamation point.

01:54.986 --> 01:57.287
hey! Shut up!

01:57.322 --> 01:58.089
it's a play

01:58.123 --> 02:00.056
That I wrote myself

02:00.091 --> 02:00.824
That will not only

02:00.858 --> 02:01.791
Touch your heart,

02:01.826 --> 02:03.993
But blow your mind.

02:04.027 --> 02:04.560
Now, if you look at

02:04.594 --> 02:06.029
These flyers, you'll see that...

02:10.702 --> 02:17.438
could you pass those out?

03:21.870 --> 03:23.170
Hey, we're not done

03:23.204 --> 03:24.305
Talking about this.

03:24.339 --> 03:24.905
I am.

03:24.940 --> 03:26.841
well, I'm not.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.576
listen, Alyssa Vaughn

03:28.610 --> 03:29.777
Is just a friend.

03:29.812 --> 03:30.745
yeah, a friend

03:30.780 --> 03:31.579
Who's already sent you

03:31.614 --> 03:33.314
Six text messages today.

03:35.251 --> 03:37.118
seven.

03:37.152 --> 03:38.219
you don't know that's her.

03:38.254 --> 03:43.392
is it?

03:43.426 --> 03:44.093
what's your favorite

03:44.127 --> 03:45.862
Tropical fruit?

03:45.896 --> 03:46.329
the mango.

03:46.363 --> 03:47.030
And I don't like

03:47.064 --> 03:48.197
Your new little relationship

03:48.232 --> 03:49.465
With Alyssa Vaughn.

03:49.499 --> 03:50.500
it's a text message.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.668
and what does it say?

03:51.702 --> 03:53.136
Maybe, "hi, Beck.

03:53.170 --> 03:54.237
"my daddy just got richer

03:54.271 --> 03:55.071
"and I got prettier.

03:55.106 --> 03:57.006
Let's make out."

03:57.041 --> 03:58.074
okay, let me see

03:58.109 --> 03:59.008
If I understand you.

03:59.043 --> 04:01.344
let's see if you do.

04:01.378 --> 04:02.979
because you and I date,

04:03.013 --> 04:03.546
I can't be friends

04:03.580 --> 04:04.447
With other girls.

04:04.482 --> 04:05.014
you can be friends

04:05.049 --> 04:07.350
With ugly girls,

04:07.384 --> 04:08.051
But not girls who are

04:08.085 --> 04:09.018
Gorgeous socialites,

04:09.053 --> 04:09.786
Who text message you

04:09.820 --> 04:10.953
A hundred times a day.

04:10.988 --> 04:11.988
you know, you...

04:12.022 --> 04:14.289
Tori, Tori, can you come here?

04:14.324 --> 04:17.526
what?

04:17.560 --> 04:18.692
if you were my girlfriend...

04:18.728 --> 04:19.793
oh, great way to start

04:19.829 --> 04:21.930
The question.

04:21.964 --> 04:22.464
Would you be

04:22.498 --> 04:23.097
All freaked out

04:23.132 --> 04:23.731
That I'm just friends

04:23.766 --> 04:24.966
With Alyssa Vaughn?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.768
who cares what she thinks?

04:26.802 --> 04:28.536
honestly, I wouldn't love it.

04:28.571 --> 04:31.039
I care what she thinks.

04:31.073 --> 04:31.906
how can you say that,

04:31.941 --> 04:32.440
You don't even...

04:32.475 --> 04:32.841
you know,

04:32.875 --> 04:33.508
I really don't wanna be

04:33.542 --> 04:34.342
In the middle of this.

04:34.376 --> 04:35.577
no, you stay right here.

04:35.611 --> 04:37.579
no.

04:37.613 --> 04:38.747
you don't think a girlfriend

04:38.781 --> 04:40.015
Should just trust her boyfriend?

04:40.049 --> 04:41.083
no, I do.

04:41.117 --> 04:41.850
get out of here, Tori.

04:41.884 --> 04:43.018
I'd love to.

04:43.052 --> 04:44.185
stay.

04:45.554 --> 04:46.621
all right, you know what?

04:46.655 --> 04:47.455
tell me what.

04:47.489 --> 04:49.490
no, no, don't tell him what.

04:49.525 --> 04:51.092
we're done.

04:51.126 --> 04:51.859
Jade.

04:51.893 --> 04:52.559
so, you're breaking up

04:52.594 --> 04:53.327
With me?

04:53.361 --> 04:54.227
no, no, no, no, no.

04:54.262 --> 04:55.162
She's not.

04:55.196 --> 04:56.496
yeah, I am.

04:56.531 --> 04:58.131
oh, she is.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.766
you're being ridiculous.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.667
what do you care?

05:00.701 --> 05:03.704
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

05:03.738 --> 05:04.571
come see my one-woman show,

05:04.605 --> 05:08.341
Friday night.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.511
It starts at 8:00 sharp!

05:22.325 --> 05:24.359
whatcha know, fro?

05:24.393 --> 05:25.594
ha, he called you fro,

05:25.628 --> 05:27.929
'cause your hair is all silly.

05:27.963 --> 05:28.596
yeah.

05:28.631 --> 05:29.597
hey, you gotta check out

05:29.631 --> 05:31.465
This new app I got for my phone.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.566
It lets you do crazy effects

05:32.601 --> 05:34.035
When you're shooting video.

05:34.069 --> 05:35.136
cool.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.305
Um, so, you know

05:37.339 --> 05:38.339
How I used to write

05:38.373 --> 05:39.607
For the school newspaper?

05:39.641 --> 05:40.007
I thought

05:40.041 --> 05:41.208
They shut the paper down.

05:41.242 --> 05:42.609
they did, but, uh...

05:42.644 --> 05:43.543
Some of the seniors

05:43.578 --> 05:45.012
Started one online, you know,

05:45.046 --> 05:46.213
Kinda underground

05:46.248 --> 05:48.215
For school news and stuff.

05:48.249 --> 05:49.383
I know, the slap.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.817
the slap dot com.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.819
the dot com was implied.

05:52.854 --> 05:54.288
anyway, so for the slap,

05:54.322 --> 05:54.988
I'm the person in charge.

05:55.023 --> 05:57.224
I made your head fat.

05:57.258 --> 05:58.792
Say cheese, fathead.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.293
cheese.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.795
Anyway, for the slap,

06:01.829 --> 06:02.362
I'm the person

06:02.397 --> 06:04.064
In charge of writing reviews

06:04.099 --> 06:04.765
For all the plays

06:04.799 --> 06:06.066
Here at school.

06:06.100 --> 06:06.833
yeah?

06:06.868 --> 06:09.336
well, I'm so busy.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.303
you're not busy.

06:11.506 --> 06:12.273
And...

06:12.307 --> 06:13.374
And you're such a good writer,

06:13.408 --> 06:14.475
I was thinking, maybe...

06:14.509 --> 06:15.309
I'm not writing a review

06:15.344 --> 06:17.145
For Trina's show.

06:17.179 --> 06:17.879
but what if her play

06:17.913 --> 06:18.880
Is awful?

06:18.914 --> 06:19.781
what if?

06:19.815 --> 06:20.314
Man, you know

06:20.349 --> 06:21.616
Her show's gonna bite.

06:21.650 --> 06:22.483
I know.

06:22.518 --> 06:23.818
And if I write a bad review,

06:23.852 --> 06:25.619
Trina is going to kill me.

06:25.654 --> 06:26.554
oh, so it's okay

06:26.588 --> 06:27.588
If she kills me?

06:27.622 --> 06:28.389
she'll have a harder time

06:28.423 --> 06:29.357
Killing you.

06:29.391 --> 06:30.525
You're all firm and developed,

06:30.559 --> 06:31.426
And I'm still working

06:31.461 --> 06:33.528
On the last chapter of puberty.

06:33.562 --> 06:37.032
and he is a slow reader.

06:37.066 --> 06:37.766
I thought Trina's play

06:37.800 --> 06:38.767
Opens Friday.

06:38.801 --> 06:39.701
it does, but I'm seeing

06:39.736 --> 06:40.836
Her last dress rehearsal,

06:40.870 --> 06:41.436
And I don't wanna be

06:41.471 --> 06:42.737
The only one in the audience.

06:42.772 --> 06:43.705
so take Rex.

06:44.407 --> 06:45.040
I'm staying home

06:45.074 --> 06:47.375
And taking a hot bath.

06:47.409 --> 06:49.144
look man, don't panic yet.

06:49.178 --> 06:49.911
Maybe Trina's play

06:49.945 --> 06:51.312
Won't be so bad.

Not even on cructhez.

07:25.179 --> 07:25.745
But I'm gonna

07:25.780 --> 07:30.583
Tell you something, "I scared.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.853
I'm a woman, in chicago,

07:33.888 --> 07:41.927
Who's scared."

07:51.202 --> 07:56.372
No.

08:00.711 --> 08:01.945
No.

08:01.979 --> 08:03.313
Stop.

08:07.718 --> 08:08.585
Hey, Jade.

08:08.619 --> 08:09.520
you look a little like a lady

08:09.554 --> 08:09.954
Who could use

08:09.988 --> 08:12.323
Some lunch buddies.

08:12.357 --> 08:13.758
please.

08:13.792 --> 08:14.726
well, I just thought

08:14.760 --> 08:15.827
That you were mad, because of...

08:15.862 --> 08:17.062
I broke up with Beck.

08:17.096 --> 08:17.562
Okay?

08:17.597 --> 08:18.664
I dumped him.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.674
you are amazing.

08:28.708 --> 08:29.642
You know that?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.176
is that Alyssa Vaughn?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.178
yeah, so?

08:33.212 --> 08:36.179
nothing, she's gross.

08:36.215 --> 08:38.082
French fry?

08:38.116 --> 08:39.283
gross?

08:39.317 --> 08:41.284
Look at her.

08:41.318 --> 08:43.520
Oh, that girl is smoking hot.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.790
I'm serious.

08:45.824 --> 08:48.093
I should shut up.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.194
look, he didn't mean

08:49.228 --> 08:49.594
To say that.

08:49.629 --> 08:50.562
I don't care.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.797
If Beck wants to date that,

08:51.831 --> 08:52.731
I hope he has tons of fun

08:52.766 --> 08:55.034
With it.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.870
what?

08:56.904 --> 09:09.983
you're hurting your burrito.

09:10.018 --> 09:10.751
Hello, Robbie.

09:11.319 --> 09:12.619
Hi.

09:12.654 --> 09:14.454
have you been avoiding me?

09:14.489 --> 09:15.021
avoid?

09:15.056 --> 09:17.324
Um, no, I'm just been here

09:17.358 --> 09:18.759
Having some cream

09:18.793 --> 09:20.093
Of mushroom soup.

09:20.128 --> 09:20.661
what do you think

09:20.695 --> 09:22.529
Of my show last night?

09:22.564 --> 09:23.564
your show,

09:23.598 --> 09:24.265
I thought it was uh...

09:24.299 --> 09:25.065
Very...

09:25.100 --> 09:27.001
you said it stunk.

09:27.035 --> 09:28.569
what did that say?

09:28.604 --> 09:29.404
nothing.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.405
Um, he doesn't know

09:30.439 --> 09:31.272
What he's saying.

09:31.307 --> 09:32.941
He's on special medication.

09:32.975 --> 09:35.143
I am not on medication.

09:35.178 --> 09:35.777
are you gonna write

09:35.812 --> 09:37.646
A good review of my show or not?

09:37.680 --> 09:40.449
Trina, see...

09:40.484 --> 09:41.650
I'm a journalist,

09:41.685 --> 09:42.284
And it's my job

09:42.319 --> 09:43.585
To write the truth.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.519
And to be candid,

09:44.554 --> 09:45.286
I didn't think

09:45.321 --> 09:46.421
That your performance was all...

09:49.791 --> 09:50.625
I'm gonna say this once,

09:50.659 --> 09:51.559
So listen.

09:51.593 --> 09:52.293
okay.

09:52.327 --> 09:53.027
I've worked my butt off

09:53.061 --> 09:53.894
On that performance,

09:53.928 --> 09:54.561
And you're gonna write

09:54.596 --> 09:55.162
A good review.

09:55.196 --> 09:56.763
You feel me?!

09:56.798 --> 09:58.565
I feel a mushroom in my nose.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.468
Aah.

10:01.502 --> 10:02.102
write a good review

10:02.136 --> 10:08.109
Of my show!

10:08.143 --> 10:12.346
there it is.

10:17.085 --> 10:17.485
mine!

10:17.519 --> 10:19.721
mine!

10:19.755 --> 10:21.055
15-love.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.625
Tori, you messed up my shot.

10:23.659 --> 10:25.794
I don't wanna play anymore.

10:27.597 --> 10:35.370
You get it.

10:35.404 --> 10:37.406
Jade?

10:37.440 --> 10:41.143
And now you're in my house.

10:41.177 --> 10:44.013
this kite is broken.

10:44.047 --> 10:44.614
okay?

10:44.648 --> 10:45.481
And?

10:45.516 --> 10:46.316
I was just walking around,

10:46.350 --> 10:47.718
And I saw this kite

10:47.752 --> 10:48.251
Stuck in a bush,

10:48.286 --> 10:49.353
And... it's broken,

10:49.387 --> 10:52.623
Someone needs to fix it.

10:52.657 --> 10:54.225
you want me to fix your kite?

10:54.259 --> 10:54.726
will you forget

10:54.760 --> 10:57.261
About the stupid kite?

10:57.296 --> 10:59.865
I'm sorry I brought it up.

10:59.899 --> 11:02.300
I want Beck back.

11:02.334 --> 11:03.301
but you broke up with Beck.

11:03.335 --> 11:04.569
I know, just like

11:04.603 --> 11:05.203
When I was seven

11:05.237 --> 11:05.836
And I threw away

11:05.871 --> 11:07.004
My potato patch pal,

11:07.038 --> 11:07.705
But then I realized

11:07.739 --> 11:08.906
I wanted him back.

11:08.940 --> 11:09.573
But it was too late,

11:09.607 --> 11:10.140
'cause my mother

11:10.175 --> 11:10.807
Already gave it away

11:10.842 --> 11:15.378
To some greedy orphans.

11:15.412 --> 11:16.445
Jade, if you wanna get back

11:16.480 --> 11:17.012
Together with Beck,

11:17.047 --> 11:17.613
Then why don't you

11:17.647 --> 11:18.580
Just tell him?

11:18.615 --> 11:22.418
I did, but he rejected me.

11:22.453 --> 11:24.020
Not to be mean,

11:24.055 --> 11:24.855
But why are you coming to me

11:24.889 --> 11:25.555
For help?

11:25.590 --> 11:26.457
because I don't want anyone

11:26.491 --> 11:28.826
Who's cool to see me like this.

11:28.860 --> 11:29.961
okay, maybe you should...

11:29.995 --> 11:30.528
Wait, are we friends?

11:30.562 --> 11:32.130
We're not even friends.

11:32.164 --> 11:33.331
well, yeah,

11:33.365 --> 11:34.332
But if you help me,

11:34.366 --> 11:37.636
Maybe I'll like you.

11:37.670 --> 11:38.837
so, if I help you,

11:38.871 --> 11:39.504
I get a mean friend

11:39.539 --> 11:42.040
And a broken kite.

11:42.074 --> 11:43.475
please, just please,

11:43.509 --> 11:57.856
Talk to Beck for me.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.691
okay, okay, okay,

11:59.726 --> 12:01.126
I'll talk to Beck.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.597
do it soon.

12:05.631 --> 12:09.868
Ah, I got a little makeup

12:09.902 --> 12:13.071
On your pillow.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.639
that's okay.

12:14.674 --> 12:16.141
I'll just ask my grandmother

12:16.175 --> 12:18.676
To make me another one,

12:18.710 --> 12:21.126
If she ever comes back to life.

12:40.293 --> 12:40.792
<i>Push the button</i>

12:40.827 --> 12:42.027
<i>By the door, sweetie.</i>

12:42.061 --> 12:45.697
Okay, thanks.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.035
<i>Who is it?!</i>

12:52.070 --> 12:54.909
I know that's you, Beck.

13:00.943 --> 13:02.310
thanks, Consuela.

13:06.014 --> 13:08.219
enter.

13:12.253 --> 13:14.488
so, this is where you live?

13:14.522 --> 13:15.756
is that bad?

13:15.790 --> 13:16.490
no, it's cool.

13:16.524 --> 13:17.491
It's just, you know,

13:17.525 --> 13:18.125
Most high school guys

13:18.159 --> 13:18.692
Don't live in a rv

13:18.726 --> 13:19.159
Parked in their

13:19.194 --> 13:20.994
Parents' driveway.

13:21.029 --> 13:21.862
well, my parents said

13:21.896 --> 13:22.963
If I live under their roof,

13:22.997 --> 13:24.297
I gotta live by their rules.

13:24.332 --> 13:26.266
ah, so your roof...

13:26.300 --> 13:29.703
My rules.

13:31.072 --> 13:32.739
so, you're probably wondering

13:32.774 --> 13:33.473
Why I'm here.

13:33.507 --> 13:34.474
Like, "hey, Tori's here,

13:34.508 --> 13:36.977
Whaddup wid dat?"

13:37.011 --> 13:38.445
that's how I talk?

13:38.479 --> 13:39.079
no, that's just

13:39.113 --> 13:41.314
My generic boy voice.

13:41.349 --> 13:42.682
ah, I like it.

13:42.717 --> 13:43.717
Do more.

13:43.751 --> 13:44.885
okay.

13:44.919 --> 13:47.721
Um, "hey man, why don't you

13:47.755 --> 13:48.755
"get back together with Jade?

13:48.790 --> 13:49.723
"you know what I'm sayin'?

13:49.757 --> 13:53.360
Yeah."

13:53.394 --> 13:54.327
I should get back together

13:54.361 --> 13:55.562
With Jade?

13:56.731 --> 13:58.031
why?

13:58.065 --> 14:02.802
'cause she's, you know,

14:02.836 --> 14:06.506
Awesome.

14:06.540 --> 14:07.306
guess what?

14:07.341 --> 14:08.274
what?

14:08.309 --> 14:08.741
I'm glad

14:08.776 --> 14:10.076
Jade and I broke up.

14:10.111 --> 14:10.910
why?

14:10.945 --> 14:11.978
because I can't remember

14:12.012 --> 14:12.479
The last time

14:12.513 --> 14:14.147
She did one nice thing for me.

14:14.181 --> 14:15.215
oh, come on, didn't you just

14:15.249 --> 14:15.983
Have a birthday?

14:16.017 --> 14:16.884
She didn't get you anything

14:16.918 --> 14:20.687
For your birthday?

14:20.722 --> 14:25.259
she got me a can of lemonade.

14:25.293 --> 14:28.095
'cause he likes lemonade.

14:28.129 --> 14:30.597
yeah, but out of a can?

14:30.631 --> 14:32.465
he drank it.

14:32.499 --> 14:32.899
yeah, but...

14:32.933 --> 14:33.899
do I have a boyfriend

14:33.934 --> 14:35.334
Or don't I?

14:35.369 --> 14:35.868
do you want one?

14:35.902 --> 14:41.773
walk away.

14:42.475 --> 14:43.308
Curly!

14:45.544 --> 14:46.511
Hi, Trina.

14:46.545 --> 14:47.445
Is that a new shirt?

14:47.479 --> 14:50.181
don't look at my shirt.

14:50.216 --> 14:51.316
I went to theslap.Com

14:51.350 --> 14:52.250
This morning and I didn't see

14:52.285 --> 14:53.953
Your review of my show yet.

14:53.987 --> 14:54.720
I know.

14:54.754 --> 14:56.588
when are you posting it?

14:56.623 --> 14:57.456
the deadline is flexible,

14:57.491 --> 14:58.824
So I'm just...

14:58.858 --> 15:01.460
Oh, please don't...

15:01.494 --> 15:02.227
your review

15:02.262 --> 15:03.262
Better go up today,

15:03.296 --> 15:03.762
And it better make

15:03.797 --> 15:06.999
My show sound awesome!

15:20.079 --> 15:28.052
still got some work to do.

15:28.086 --> 15:31.755
aw, my canadian sweater!

15:31.790 --> 15:33.424
It's not funny.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.458
Trina keeps pressuring me

15:34.492 --> 15:35.860
To write a good review

15:35.894 --> 15:37.061
Of her terrible play,

15:37.096 --> 15:40.432
And I can't lie.

15:40.466 --> 15:41.533
her play was that bad?

15:41.567 --> 15:44.236
so bad, it was laughable.

15:44.271 --> 15:45.104
okay, okay.

15:45.138 --> 15:46.439
Then, say it was

15:46.473 --> 15:46.939
The funniest play

15:46.974 --> 15:47.840
You've ever seen.

15:47.875 --> 15:48.608
oh, what are you

15:48.642 --> 15:50.043
Talking about?

15:50.077 --> 15:52.579
review it like a comedy.

15:52.613 --> 15:53.313
comedy?

15:56.917 --> 15:57.850
that's brilliant.

15:57.884 --> 15:58.951
hey, no charge.

15:58.985 --> 15:59.952
thanks, man.

15:59.986 --> 16:01.987
no, wait, give me 10 bucks.

16:02.021 --> 16:03.488
absolutely not.

16:03.523 --> 16:04.122
20.

16:04.157 --> 16:06.858
are two 10s okay?

16:06.892 --> 16:08.059
help me.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.160
I tried.

16:09.194 --> 16:09.693
Maybe you just need

16:09.728 --> 16:14.598
To forget about Beck.

16:14.632 --> 16:18.568
What are you doing?

16:18.603 --> 16:22.038
And now we're in a closet.

16:22.073 --> 16:22.806
how can Beck

16:22.840 --> 16:24.507
Not want me back?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.610
I'm so cool, and hot.

16:26.644 --> 16:30.046
I've got it all.

16:30.080 --> 16:30.780
yeah, but guys

16:30.814 --> 16:31.514
Don't just care

16:31.549 --> 16:32.982
About how cool and hot you are.

16:33.017 --> 16:34.584
well, what else is there?

16:34.618 --> 16:35.351
Beck said you haven't done

16:35.385 --> 16:36.319
One nice thing for him

16:36.353 --> 16:37.453
In two years.

16:37.487 --> 16:39.288
that is so not true.

16:39.322 --> 16:40.489
We've only dated a year

16:40.524 --> 16:42.524
And eleven months.

16:42.559 --> 16:42.958
well, maybe

16:42.993 --> 16:43.592
He'd take you back

16:43.626 --> 16:44.459
If you did something

16:44.494 --> 16:46.027
Nice for him.

16:46.062 --> 16:46.628
you mean, like

16:46.662 --> 16:49.765
Make him fresh lemonade?

16:49.799 --> 16:50.499
if you want Beck back,

16:50.533 --> 16:51.199
You're gonna have to think

16:51.234 --> 16:52.801
Bigger than beverages.

16:52.835 --> 16:53.569
a dog.

16:53.603 --> 16:54.136
okay, if you're

16:54.170 --> 16:54.737
Gonna be rude...

16:56.006 --> 16:56.305
No.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.040
Beck's always saying

16:57.074 --> 16:57.807
How he wants a dog,

16:57.842 --> 17:00.477
A rotten-hymer.

17:00.511 --> 17:01.078
a rottweiler?

17:01.112 --> 17:03.013
yes, that's what he wants.

17:03.047 --> 17:04.513
Okay, what's our next move?

17:04.549 --> 17:07.984
just get the boy a dog!

17:08.019 --> 17:08.952
go, go out.

17:08.987 --> 17:15.893
Out now. Run...

17:15.926 --> 17:17.060
and then at 10 P.M.,

17:17.095 --> 17:17.862
When president lincoln

17:17.896 --> 17:18.930
Was watching the play

17:18.964 --> 17:19.931
At ford's theater,

17:19.964 --> 17:21.065
Booth quietly slipped

17:21.098 --> 17:22.266
Into lincoln's box,

17:22.300 --> 17:23.601
Pulled out a derringer

17:23.635 --> 17:25.336
And shouted...

17:25.369 --> 17:27.404
I'm gonna kill you!

17:27.438 --> 17:28.338
no.

17:28.372 --> 17:29.206
man, you better run

17:29.240 --> 17:29.807
Before the girl...

17:32.244 --> 17:33.077
Rex!

17:33.111 --> 17:34.745
Trina, I'm teaching a class

17:34.780 --> 17:35.112
Right now.

17:35.147 --> 17:35.913
how dare you call

17:35.947 --> 17:37.548
My one-woman show a comedy?!

17:37.583 --> 17:38.049
I had to follow

17:38.083 --> 17:39.283
My conscience!

17:39.318 --> 17:46.624
Trina, out of this classroom.

17:46.659 --> 17:48.126
I know where you live.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.060
no, you don't.

17:49.094 --> 17:50.495
We moved last year.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.463
what's your new address?!

17:51.497 --> 17:52.831
3707 cahuenga.

17:52.866 --> 17:55.701
It's a duplex, we're on top.

17:55.735 --> 18:09.315
got it.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.350
Trina vega's one-woman show

18:11.384 --> 18:14.553
Will now begin.

18:14.587 --> 18:16.121
in the beginning,

18:16.156 --> 18:18.357
There was nothing,

18:18.391 --> 18:29.603
And then, there was woman.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.276
Wow, I can't believe I'm here

18:35.310 --> 18:37.445
In the city of chicago.

18:37.479 --> 18:38.780
Why, anything could happen

18:38.814 --> 18:40.448
To a woman like me,

Give me the dog.

19:27.799 --> 19:28.966
okay.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.702
Oh wait, he has a runny nose.

19:33.938 --> 19:34.471
dogs don't know

19:34.506 --> 19:36.873
How to blow their nose.

19:41.412 --> 19:45.848
okay, give me the dog.

19:45.882 --> 19:46.815
Okay, go on, go in there.

19:46.849 --> 19:50.152
Go lick Beck's face, good boy.

19:50.186 --> 19:51.453
Ahh, okay, if this makes Beck

19:51.487 --> 19:52.053
Like me again,

19:52.088 --> 19:53.288
I'm gonna owe you big time.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.357
you already owe me big time.

19:57.894 --> 19:58.461
what's going on?

19:58.495 --> 20:00.196
I don't know.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.398
Beck, Beck.

20:02.433 --> 20:03.733
Are you okay?

20:03.768 --> 20:06.570
does he sound okay?

20:06.605 --> 20:06.937
Beck!

20:06.972 --> 20:07.471
Beck!

20:07.506 --> 20:08.072
Get him off me.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.073
that was horrible.

20:09.107 --> 20:09.874
I know.

20:09.908 --> 20:10.575
now, he's never gonna

20:10.609 --> 20:12.844
Take me back.

20:12.879 --> 20:13.378
that is not

20:13.412 --> 20:15.313
The key issue right now.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.448
well, what are we gonna do?

20:17.851 --> 20:18.617
no, not the face,

20:18.651 --> 20:19.117
Not the face.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.185
what is going on?

20:20.220 --> 20:20.586
get back.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.888
Beck?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.122
how can you be out here?

20:24.157 --> 20:24.723
you're in there

20:24.757 --> 20:26.057
Being mauled by a dog.

20:26.092 --> 20:26.424
a dog?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.626
My dad's in there.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.293
your dad?

20:28.328 --> 20:29.328
oh, my god.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.562
dad, dad.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.132
Whoa, that's a big dog.

20:33.166 --> 20:33.966
Dad.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.508
I'm doing it.

20:41.543 --> 20:44.245
I'm doing it.

20:44.279 --> 20:46.314
I'm a woman in chicago,

20:46.349 --> 20:51.153
Learning how to walk again,

20:51.187 --> 20:52.187
Thanks to doc stevens

20:52.221 --> 20:57.325
And my new plastic legs.

20:57.359 --> 20:59.094
Take that, chicago.

20:59.128 --> 20:59.728
You're no match

20:59.762 --> 21:01.663
For a woman like me.

21:01.697 --> 21:03.098
From now on,

21:03.132 --> 21:05.033
I'm callin' this city...

21:05.067 --> 21:09.537
She-cago!

21:14.142 --> 21:16.210
yes, you're welcome.

21:16.244 --> 21:18.813
You're all welcome.

21:18.847 --> 21:22.584
Yes, it's okay to laugh.

21:22.618 --> 21:25.220
I'm hilarious.

21:27.090 --> 21:27.623
I'll meet you

21:27.657 --> 21:28.557
At the hospital.

21:28.591 --> 21:29.792
okay.

21:29.826 --> 21:30.326
we're sorry.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.260
so sorry.

21:31.295 --> 21:35.966
oh, why.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.501
he'll be fine.

21:37.535 --> 21:38.502
thanks.

21:38.536 --> 21:42.072
hey, are you in college yet?

21:42.107 --> 21:48.313
bye.

21:56.256 --> 21:56.688
Tori told me

21:56.723 --> 21:57.756
To get you a dog.

21:57.791 --> 21:59.925
dude.

21:59.959 --> 22:02.361
okay, it was kind of my idea,

22:02.395 --> 22:03.095
But I didn't think

22:03.129 --> 22:04.529
The dog would bug out like that.

22:04.564 --> 22:05.998
I just wanted you to have a dog,

22:06.032 --> 22:06.765
Because I know you've talked

22:06.799 --> 22:07.299
About getting one

22:07.333 --> 22:07.933
Ever since I met you,

22:07.967 --> 22:15.340
And I thought that maybe...

22:15.374 --> 22:17.275
You love me again.

22:17.309 --> 22:18.910
who said I stopped?

22:22.814 --> 22:26.316
I ruined the moment.

22:26.351 --> 22:27.050
it's cool.

22:27.084 --> 22:42.298
And I really do owe you.

22:42.332 --> 22:45.168
hey, um, it's getting

22:45.202 --> 22:45.668
Kinda late,

22:45.703 --> 22:46.469
So I was wondering

22:46.503 --> 22:46.970
If maybe you could

22:47.004 --> 22:48.037
Drive me home?

22:48.071 --> 22:50.578
it's not that far a walk.

22:56.613 --> 22:58.729
try not to swallow
each other.
