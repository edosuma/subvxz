Listen, I was just thinking, uh --

00:49.849 --> 00:51.248
I-I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.718

-- I know.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.512
-- 90 days.
-- Listen...

01:28.588 --> 01:30.022
There's a statute
of limitations.

01:30.090 --> 01:30.648
So you've said.

01:30.723 --> 01:31.849
And it's 90 days.

01:31.925 --> 01:32.858
I'd rather not
talk about it.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.052
It's just the time is right,

01:34.127 --> 01:35.458
and I don't want you
to be scared.

01:35.528 --> 01:36.996
I appreciate that,
but I'm not scared.

01:37.063 --> 01:39.122
You've been telling me for
3 months that you are scared.

01:39.199 --> 01:40.291
Well...l am scared.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.334
Right,
and I don't want you to be.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.597
Yeah, that's great,

01:43.670 --> 01:45.798
but fear doesn't really
work like that.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.863
Good evening.
I'm shuffling the 10 block.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.500
Where's the network feed?

01:49.576 --> 01:50.771
It's lumber sports.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.006
Got it.
I'm shuffling the 10 block.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.740
Dan, Casey --
DeNardids confirmed,

01:54.814 --> 01:56.304
so let's lead with it.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.941
-- We're gonna lead with DeNardio?
-- Yeah.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.247
-- Come on, we gotta lead
with the Jets. -- Why?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.651
'Cause it's a better story.

02:01.721 --> 02:02.745
That's a really good point,
Casey,

02:02.822 --> 02:03.482
and thanks for the tap
on the shoulder.

02:03.556 --> 02:04.682
Now, lead with DeNardio,

02:04.757 --> 02:05.724
and fix your tie.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.157
I've got a new top story.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.318
I moved up DeNardio.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.555
This trumps DeNardio.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.494
Talk to me.

02:10.562 --> 02:11.997
Cho Chang, a Chinese swimmer,

02:12.065 --> 02:13.191
is swimming
the Taiwan Strait --

02:13.266 --> 02:14.859
from Pescadores,
or Pong Hu, to Tun Ting Dao.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.458
And there's some question
as to whether

02:16.536 --> 02:18.800
the mainland Chinese government
is gonna let her come ashore.

02:18.872 --> 02:19.930
Some quick facts --

02:20.006 --> 02:21.633
the island is separated
from South China

02:21.708 --> 02:23.233
by the 161-kilometer-wide
strait,

02:23.309 --> 02:24.902
and together with
Matsu and Quemoy

02:24.978 --> 02:27.504
forms the seat of the government
of the Republic of China,

02:27.580 --> 02:30.948
which, of course, claims
the right to rule <i>all</i> China.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.386
The capital is Taipei.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.082
I could feed it
to Dan and Casey.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.352
Not this second.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.449
Nieuwendyk is pitching in
the fourth with 11 strikeouts.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.017
Tell Dana
we can move it upfront.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.324
Tell her it's K-J-A-T.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.625
We can get a live feed
in the seventh.

02:44.697 --> 02:45.789
<i>Dave: 30 seconds to VTR.</i>

02:45.865 --> 02:46.991
-- <i>Where's Dana?</i>
-- <i>Stand by, animation.</i>

02:47.066 --> 02:48.465
-- She's in the sound --
-- Not you.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.264
-- She's back in the sound room.
Dana: Rfgh <i>t</i> here.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.997
Nieuwendyk has 11 strikeouts
in the fourth.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.233
A ground ball back to the mound
is the only thing in play.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.036
Let's move DeNardio
back to the 20.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.304
We're leading with DeNardio.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.970
Nieuwendyk is on pace to
break the record.

02:59.078 --> 03:00.910
-- When he breaks the record,
we'll break the news. -- Dana...

03:00.947 --> 03:03.006
Dana, the woman's halfway
to Tun Ting Dao.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.015
Please stop saying that.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.710
-- Roll VTR.
-- 60 seconds live.

03:05.785 --> 03:06.946
Casey...

03:07.020 --> 03:08.488
Dana, we can get
the feed from K-J-A-T.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.613
We want to be in on this.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.179
-- We'll be in on it later.
-- Let's lead with it.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.418
-- Natalie...
-- Listen, Chun King,

03:12.492 --> 03:13.789
if you want to say
something to me,

03:13.860 --> 03:14.986
you say it to somebody else.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.222
-- Dan.
-- <i>Got it.</i>

03:16.296 --> 03:17.821
We're changing the lead
to Nieuwendyk.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.126
We're not changing the lead.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.360
We're keeping it the Jets?

03:20.433 --> 03:21.662
We're keeping it DeNardio.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.327
<i>There's a chance
it's gonna be</i>

03:23.403 --> 03:25.132
a Chinese swimmer
named Cho Chang.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.833
There's no chance it's gonna be a
Chinese swimmer named Cho Chang.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.068
It's not gonna be Nieuwendyk.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.871
It used to be the Jets,
but now it's DeNardio,

03:30.944 --> 03:32.378
and I wish you'd script it.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.640
<i>Dave: 30 seconds live.</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:34.612
We got this, right?

03:34.681 --> 03:36.240
Good evening.
From New York City,

03:36.316 --> 03:37.841
I'm Blah-Blah-Blah
alongside...

03:37.917 --> 03:40.249
...Blah-Blah-Blah.
Those stories, plus...

03:40.320 --> 03:43.654
Tony DeNardio has a new job, and
he won't be wearing crimson.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.088
-- How 'bout that?
-- That's good!

03:45.158 --> 03:46.717
You guys are all set.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.090
-- Thank you, Alyson. -- We're
wingin' the tease tonight, Alyson.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.595
Good luck.

03:49.662 --> 03:51.756
Flyin' without a script
for 18 seconds.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.390
-- Living on the edge.
-- Living over the edge.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.490
<i>Dave." In 10.</i>

03:54.567 --> 03:55.796
Do you guys know
what you're doing?

03:55.868 --> 03:57.495
-- Yes.
-- Yes.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.163
In 3...2...

03:59.239 --> 04:01.367
-- Good evening. From New York City,
-- Good evening. From New York City,

04:01.441 --> 04:03.068

-- Those stories, plus --

04:08.314 --> 04:09.839
You go.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.213
Those stories, plus...

04:11.284 --> 04:14.276
Tony DeNardio has a new job
and won't be wearing crimson.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.551
Team Penske is driving on tires
that won't be wearing down,

04:17.624 --> 04:19.490
and the Eagles have
a placekicker

04:19.559 --> 04:21.584
who won't be
wearing out his welcome.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.288
All that coming up
after this.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.697
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.790
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

04:27.867 --> 04:29.528
Is it over yet?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.229
-- All right, that was totally his fault!
-- All right, that was totally his fault!

04:31.304 --> 04:31.964
[Groans]

04:32.038 --> 04:33.938
2 minutes back.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.672
<i>Stand by, 5.</i>

04:38.745 --> 04:41.771
DeNardio's career highlights
include 11 bowl appearances,

04:41.848 --> 04:43.043
7 bowl victories,

04:43.116 --> 04:45.983
and a career regular-season
winning percentage of .632.

04:46.052 --> 04:49.113
For more, here's Kelly
Kirkpatrick in College Park.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.349
-- <i>Go, 5.</i>
-- <i>Stand by, one.</i>

04:50.423 --> 04:52.414
Yeah, Isaac, I'm really
sorry about that opening.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.857
I pushed DeNardio
up to the 10s

04:53.926 --> 04:55.223
and teased it
at the last minute.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.424
You can punish me
appropriately.

04:58.498 --> 04:59.693
Who's this?

04:59.766 --> 05:00.790
They changed
the interoffice system.

05:00.867 --> 05:01.891
The control room.
Who's this?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.663
Dana, they changed
the interoffice system.

05:03.736 --> 05:04.498
All right, well...

05:04.570 --> 05:05.765
Sorry anyway.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.738
Jeremy, did they change
the interoffice system?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.105
-- They switched over --
-- Was she talking to you?

05:10.176 --> 05:11.769
I'm pretty sure she was, yes.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.108
I'll be right back.
Natalie's got the wheel.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.342
-- Dave?
-- 90 seconds back.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.510
You absolutely have to take
this risk.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.814
Risks aren't really
my strong suit, Danny.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.377
Tell me about it, Casey.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.947
I can't, you know, become
this thing that I'm not.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.492
You are this thing
that you're not.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.721
No, I'm not.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.627
She thinks you are.
I think you are.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.256
She thinks I am?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.567
Isaac...

05:36.636 --> 05:38.297
Nieuwendyk's got
14 strikeouts.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.861
Yeah.
I'm sorry about the tease.

05:39.939 --> 05:40.963
Why?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.031
We screwed up
the show opening.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.042
When?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.441
Just now.
Didn't you see it?

05:45.511 --> 05:46.706
-- No.
-- Why not?

05:46.779 --> 05:48.611
We're not on the air yet.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.115
W-What are you talking about?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.480
We're on at 11:10 tonight.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.485
Since when?

05:53.553 --> 05:55.783
We pushed 10 minutes
for lumber sports.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.118
Why didn't anyone tell me?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.090
Is it possible
I forgot to tell you

05:59.192 --> 06:01.593
about being pushed to 11:10
for lumber sports?

06:01.627 --> 06:02.788
Yes, Isaac,
it is entirely possible

06:02.862 --> 06:04.956
that you forgot to tell me.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.931
-- VVell, you had the network feed --
-- We didn't have the network feed.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.558
We turned off
the network feed.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.228
-- <i>Why?</i> -- <i>Will's afraid
of lumber sports.</i>

06:11.304 --> 06:12.328
What the hell --

06:12.405 --> 06:13.668
He's afraid of the axes
and the saws.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.037
He thinks
they're gonna cut themselves.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.007
-- I don't <i>understand</i> --
-- <i>He just is, okay?</i>

06:16.075 --> 06:18.066
How could you forget
to tell me?

06:18.144 --> 06:19.612
Sorry.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.147
Sorry?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.409
Yeah. Yeah.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.712
So...how you doin'?

06:24.784 --> 06:25.979
Who cares how I'm doing?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.111
Isaac, I've gotta go start
the show again.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.157
This is the craziest thing I've
ever experienced in my life.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.692
Well, then,
you gotta live more, Dana,

06:32.759 --> 06:34.488
'cause there's some
crazy-ass stuff out there.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.324
I have to go now.
11:10?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.659
Yes.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.062
You didn't turn off the clocks
in there, did you?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.760
Will's not afraid of clocks.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.926
You look good today,

06:43.002 --> 06:44.595
and your speech
is getting better.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.536
Go.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.104
Casey, you know --

06:50.176 --> 06:52.144
I know.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.043
What's the worst
that could happen, hmm?

06:54.113 --> 06:55.205
[Sighs]

06:55.281 --> 06:56.749
She could say no,
she could laugh,

06:56.816 --> 06:59.513
and then I'd feel sad
and ashamed for a long time,

06:59.585 --> 07:01.610
and I already did that
for 11 years.

07:01.687 --> 07:02.950

this broadcast to tell you

07:18.704 --> 07:21.639
that Casey took gymnastics
after school for 7 years.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.197
How is he looking
to you now, girls?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.437
Dana --

07:24.510 --> 07:26.308
We're not on the air,
you idiots.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.346
<i>What happened?</i>

07:27.413 --> 07:28.812
<i>We're going up
10 minutes late.</i>

07:28.881 --> 07:29.848
Why didn't we get word?

07:29.916 --> 07:31.077
<i>We did get</i> word.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.481
-- Are you kidding me?
-- Don't worry about it.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.418
-- Are you telling me Isaac --
-- Don't worry about it.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.216
Natalie, back up the field
10 minutes.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.415
-- Dave...
-- 11:10?

07:37.490 --> 07:38.958
That's right.
Put us back at ready-1.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.322
Can I see you two a second?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.657
That's 2:20 to VTR, everybody.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.127
Let's do it again.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.200
It's like he didn't even care.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.259
-- Isaac?
-- Yeah.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.463
He forgot to tell me?

07:52.538 --> 07:53.903
<i>I think it would be great</i>

07:53.973 --> 07:55.099
if we'd all stop worrying
about Isaac.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.232
<i>I think it would be great</i>

07:56.309 --> 07:57.868
if he stopped giving us
cause to worry.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.105
Just keep an eye out, okay?

07:59.178 --> 08:01.806
Yeah.

Sorry.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.591
[indistinct voices]

08:18.498 --> 08:19.693
Right there --
you know what that was?

08:19.765 --> 08:20.755
What?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.164
Another missed opportunity.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.567
You miss enough of them,
and the ballgame's over.

08:24.637 --> 08:28.267
Well, let's see if we can do
the show right this time.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.981
<i>Dan: Don't go anywhere, folks.
There's more to come.</i>

08:37.049 --> 08:39.780
We've got Columbus,
Colorado, D.C., and I.A. --

08:39.852 --> 08:41.751
4 soccer highlights.
Pinch me.

08:41.821 --> 08:45.155
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so stick around.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.419
We're out.

08:46.492 --> 08:48.654
Dana, what are we doing
about Nieuwendyk?

08:48.728 --> 08:50.526
He's got 18 after 7. If he
goes to 19, we'll break in.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.563
Finally.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.759
Elliott, set the feed.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.164
90 seconds back.

08:55.234 --> 08:56.030
Do you have a second?

08:56.102 --> 08:57.228
No, I don't have a second.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.634
Actually, you have 90 seconds.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.137
I'm using this time
for myself.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.300
-- Natalie...
-- Outside.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.371
[Telephone ringing]

09:10.449 --> 09:11.712
-- Okay.
-- Well?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.650
-- First of all --
-- Yes.

09:13.719 --> 09:14.845
Thank you for seeing me.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.447
-- What do you want?
-- I want to say...

09:17.523 --> 09:20.549
while acknowledging that not everyone
shares each other's view of the world,

09:20.626 --> 09:23.823
and while most situations between 2 or
more people involve various shades of gray

09:23.896 --> 09:25.057
-- as opposed to black and white
-- -- What are you trying to say?

09:25.131 --> 09:26.895
I'm trying to say that
I'm right and you're wrong.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.695
And what's more, you know
I'm right and you're wrong.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.668
No, you mean you're right
and I'm cute.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.670
Natalie, they wanted you
to be a damn weathergirl.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.502
They wanted me for local sports
and human interest.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.700
You turned down the job.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.573
-- Why are we still fighting?
-- You know why!

09:37.643 --> 09:39.805
-- No, I really don't! -- “They
want you because you're oute“?

09:39.879 --> 09:41.074
They wanted you
because they're idiots.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.672
-- Thank you.
-- You know what I mean.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.738
-- I do know what you mean! -- You
weren't gonna get to do any writing.

09:43.816 --> 09:45.215
You weren't gonna get
to do any reporting.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.616
They were gonna hand you
wire copy and dress you --

09:47.687 --> 09:48.882
I understand that, Jeremy.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.582
I've been doing this
a few years.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.057
I'm talking about you being
upset I got the offer at all.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.854
-- I don't know why you think I was upset!
-- You were acting like --

09:54.927 --> 09:56.952
-- You're wrong.
-- I'm not.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.396
And even if you're right, I don't know
what's so wrong about being bummed

09:59.465 --> 10:00.762
because you might move
to Galveston, Texas.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.096
Nothing.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.466
Except that's not what
you were bummed about.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.165
[Telephones ringing]

10:11.143 --> 10:13.544
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:15.547
Welcome back.
Here's what's going on.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.277
Timothy Nieuwendyk just
struck out his 19th batter --

10:18.351 --> 10:20.752
one short of tying
and two short of breaking

10:20.820 --> 10:22.413
the all-time
major league record.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.650
We're gonna take you out
to San Francisco,

10:24.724 --> 10:26.453
we're gonna
take you there live,

10:26.525 --> 10:28.357
and you're gonna stay
for as long as it takes.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.054
I know we promised you
soccer highlights,

10:30.129 --> 10:32.757
so let me just tell you that
Columbus beat Miami 1-0,

10:32.832 --> 10:34.732
Dallas beat San Jose 1-0,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.529
Chicago beat Colorado 1-0,

10:36.602 --> 10:39.128
and New England
beat Kansas City 2-1

10:39.205 --> 10:41.196
in an offensive slugfest.

10:41.273 --> 10:43.799
A modest proposal --
make the nets bigger.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.368
John Savitch and Tom Vance
in San Francisco.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.537

too far.</i>

10:48.948 --> 10:51.110
-- <i>Make the nets bigger?</i>
-- <i>You got</i> a <i>better idea?</i>

10:51.183 --> 10:52.344
-- Yes.
-- <i>What?</i>

10:52.418 --> 10:54.318
How about
a smaller net and no goalie?

10:54.387 --> 10:56.116
-- I like it.
-- Yeah, like basketball.

10:56.188 --> 10:57.678
Listen to me --
you gotta --

10:57.757 --> 10:59.725
Do you get that there are
certain ways

10:59.792 --> 11:01.260
in which I am not like you?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.351
Yes.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.260
You walk up to women.
You're that guy.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.264
You have a smoothness.
It works for you.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.130
Those are the ways
in which I'm not like you.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.363
I just thought you meant cause
you were allergic to bees.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.773

more concerned about</i>

11:14.840 --> 11:17.241

[Clicks TV off]

11:23.049 --> 11:24.244

11:24.316 --> 11:27.342
Either that or a lot smaller
and get rid of the goalies.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.821
[Laughs] Dan, this network
has a 3-year deal

11:29.889 --> 11:30.947
with major league soccer.

11:31.023 --> 11:31.990
I know.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.457
That's why
I'm trying to help out.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.223
Two billion soccer fans
will be happy to hear that.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.197
So, what happened?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.666
-- When?
-- Before.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.100
What do you mean?

11:44.170 --> 11:45.103
You forgot?

11:45.171 --> 11:46.138
-- That?
-- Yeah.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.695
I forgot.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.832
Isaac, you can't work
full time.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.206
-- I have to.
-- Why?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.802
Because they pay me to.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.209
You had a stroke.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.146
-- Is that what that was?
-- Yes.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.309
I thought it was
bad swordfish.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.820
-- Isaac, I'm not kidding around here.
-- Leave me alone, Danny.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.913
Where are you going?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.253
To get myself a drink.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.486
Are you allowed to drink?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.857
Danny, I'm 63 years old!

12:08.928 --> 12:11.158
I've got a driver's license
and everything.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.427
-- I meant in your condition.
-- I know what you meant.

service, I want to know who I go see.

were going up 1O minutes fate?</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:34.614
Yes, I did.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.314
Admit that it's harder now.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.822
I have no trouble
admitting that.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.289
Ask people
to do things for you.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.883
-- Like what?
-- Like getting you a drink.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.553
Why?

12:42.628 --> 12:45.154
Because you've been walking over to
that bar for, like, a half an hour now.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.791
[Laughs]

12:47.867 --> 12:49.631
-- I'm getting stronger.
-- Yeah.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.999
The recovery period --

12:51.070 --> 12:52.094
The recovery period's
12 months.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.536
Yes.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.438
Then why are you back at work
after <i>5</i> months?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.408
Because I am.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.705
You know what, Danny?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.304
On your best day,
you make about 10 mistakes,

13:01.380 --> 13:03.109
and if you don't believe me,

13:03.182 --> 13:06.914
let's take a look at the
file tape on tonight's teaser.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.283
That was my fault.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.446
I'll say.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.891
I made a mistake just like
the ones I used to make.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.290
And there was a time

13:15.361 --> 13:17.830
when you and Casey would
come in here

13:17.897 --> 13:19.592
and beat the hell out of me

13:19.665 --> 13:21.633
till tears were coming out
of my eyes,

13:21.700 --> 13:23.259
I was laughing so hard.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.630
I'm not your damn
grandfather.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.332
Don't treat me that way.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.533
When I screw up,

13:29.608 --> 13:32.703
I don't want you
coming in here for the talk.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.509
I want to hear some chatter
out there.

13:37.082 --> 13:38.516

this is gonna happen,

14:19.191 --> 14:20.352
so what do we do?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.394
How 'bout we listen to what
the other person is saying

14:22.461 --> 14:23.656
instead of trying
to interpret?

14:23.729 --> 14:24.662
-- Oh, please.
-- Natalie...

14:24.730 --> 14:25.993
Men harbor this illusion

14:26.065 --> 14:27.863
that they can cover up
their, you know,

14:27.967 --> 14:30.163
with this other thing,
but women always know.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.670
No, they don't.

14:31.737 --> 14:32.863
You know why not?

14:32.938 --> 14:34.531
Because women don't have
special powers.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.575
Let's dispense with
that theory right now.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.167
Women don't have
a sixth sense,

they don't have special powers.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.142

14:56.362 --> 14:57.591
because one minute,

14:57.663 --> 14:59.757
I'm paying my bills with money
I'm earning at my dream job,

14:59.832 --> 15:02.096
while dating the most beautiful
woman on the planet,

15:02.167 --> 15:04.033
and the next minute,
I'm on a cattle drive

15:04.103 --> 15:06.731
and I'm dating the weathergirl
from "Good Morning, Galveston."

15:06.805 --> 15:08.899
And I'd have done it.
I'd have moved to Galveston

15:08.974 --> 15:10.772
with the heat and the cattle
and the malaria.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.937
I'd have done it, because
that's how much I love you,

15:13.012 --> 15:15.447
and that's how much
I want what you want.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.074
But you can't expect me
to be wild about the idea.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.811
What?

15:21.887 --> 15:24.254
You are so cute.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.792
-- Natalie...
-- You are just so cute.

15:26.859 --> 15:27.849
Listen...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.191
We need to be serious
for just a second.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.923
I'm totally serious.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.289
Listen...

15:34.366 --> 15:35.333
What?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.369
-- Nothing.
-- What?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.063
The thing is...
[Sighs]

15:39.138 --> 15:41.573
-- Your instinct wasn't entirely wrong.
-- I know.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.699
I didn't behave like a man.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.904
You're apologizing like one.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.538
Yeah?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.343
You're so cute
it freaks me out.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.544
All right, well,
let's just say --

15:52.618 --> 15:53.642
-- Let's just say what?
-- Nothing.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.585
No, it's okay. You want to make a
little proclamation. I can tell.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.213
I don't want to make
a proclamation.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.279
Sure, you do. Go ahead.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.824
-- Well, no, it's just --
-- Come on.

15:59.858 --> 16:02.828
I deem that the fight
is officially over.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.329
Excellent.

16:04.396 --> 16:06.228
I deem I'm coming to bed
tonight in your tuxedo shirt,

16:06.298 --> 16:07.390
high heels, and nothing else.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.560
-- Excellent.
-- <i>Guys.</i>

16:09.635 --> 16:11.262
Don't tell me women don't
have special powers.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.566
What's up, Elliott?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.163
-- Are you watching the game?
-- Oh, man! No.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.263
Nieuwendyk isn't looking
so good.

16:15.341 --> 16:16.672
Give me audio.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.879
-- Hey.
-- Oh, hey.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.477
Whatcha doin'?

16:28.554 --> 16:30.852
[Chuckles] I'm hanging out
in your office.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.118
I can see.

16:32.191 --> 16:35.718
I do that sometimes... during
the show, during breaks.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.023
I like it in here.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.461
I like the skyline --

16:38.530 --> 16:40.828
better than the one
in my office.

16:40.899 --> 16:41.957
-- Really?
-- No.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.593
I just made all that up.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.196
I was in here because
I thought you might be in here.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.537
Oh, yeah.
And I am.

16:50.609 --> 16:51.542
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

16:51.610 --> 16:53.476
So I was right.

16:53.545 --> 16:55.172
<i>[ Chuckles ]</i>

16:57.683 --> 16:59.981
[Sighing]
That is a beautiful skyline.

17:00.052 --> 17:03.386
It's a beautiful city.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.493
You know...

17:08.560 --> 17:11.461
This is gonna sound, uh --
you're gonna laugh at this.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.861
[Chuckles]
Try me.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.421
Danny's been talking to me
all week

17:14.500 --> 17:15.865
about the statute
of limitations.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.095
Have you committed a crime?

17:17.169 --> 17:18.261
No, no. I --
Well, I mean,

17:18.337 --> 17:19.827
back when I was pledging
my fraternity,

17:19.905 --> 17:21.771
but I took care of that
with community service.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.932
[Chuckling]
I remember.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.305
No.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.141
Danny...was talking
about that it's been 90 days

17:27.212 --> 17:29.909
since you broke off
the engagement with Gordon.

17:29.982 --> 17:34.112
<i>And that that was
my opportunity to, you know,</i>

17:34.186 --> 17:37.850
to -- if I was gonna --
to...ask you out.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.250
<i>That was my opportunity
to ask you out.</i>

17:42.327 --> 17:43.590
The statute of limitations?

17:43.662 --> 17:44.629
Yeah.

17:44.696 --> 17:46.095
[Exhales sharply]

17:47.666 --> 17:51.000
<i>Anyway...I'd better
get back to the, uh...</i>

17:51.070 --> 17:52.936
you know.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.700
Go back.

17:54.773 --> 17:56.969
It's 60 days.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.203
What?

17:58.310 --> 18:00.335
It's 60 days.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.440
Whatcha been
waiting on, McCall?

18:03.515 --> 18:05.609
I was --

18:05.684 --> 18:07.015
Huh?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.252
I was, y-you know, waiting.

18:11.323 --> 18:14.122
You were waiting for what,
St. Swithin's Day?

18:14.193 --> 18:16.287
<i>I was waiting
the proper 90 days</i>

18:16.361 --> 18:17.556
the way I was taught.

18:17.629 --> 18:18.619
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

18:18.697 --> 18:20.529
whoever taught you
taught you wrong.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.260
It was Danny.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.598
No kidding.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.399
Well, listen, then,
unless you wave me off,

18:26.472 --> 18:27.735
I'm gonna kiss you right now.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.503
If it's not
too much trouble.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.443
I'm gonna do it, Dana.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.571
I'm saying do it, Casey.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.615
[Chuckles]
You've done this before, right?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.160
I mean, you have a child.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.753
Yes. Sure.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.196
Absolutely.

18:53.265 --> 18:55.233
Good.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.790
Yes.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.564
-- Casey?
-- Yeah?

18:58.670 --> 19:00.001
I'm standing here.

19:00.038 --> 19:01.767
Right, all I was thinking

19:01.840 --> 19:05.902
was that I have to be back on the
air in, uh, just a short time.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.104
Right.

19:07.179 --> 19:09.944
And squeezing this in between
the Tim Nieuwendyk

19:10.015 --> 19:12.609
[Chuckling]
and the NFL injury report

19:12.684 --> 19:13.879
seems, uh...

19:13.952 --> 19:16.182
-- You're right.
-- Aren't I?

19:16.255 --> 19:17.245
Yes.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.256
So after the show.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.587
Yes.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.424
Good.
I'll meet you back here.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.657
-- Tell Natalie I'm on my way.
-- Good.

19:25.731 --> 19:29.725
<i>F Does he love me?
I wanna know F</i>

19:29.801 --> 19:33.169
<i>F How can I tell

19:33.238 --> 19:35.036
<i>F Is it in his eyes? fl</i>

<i>F Oh, no, it's just his charm F</i>

20:15.180 --> 20:16.670
Stand by, animation.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.477
-- <i>Fl You know it's love fl</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:20.245
-- f' <i>If it</i> really <i>is</i> f' -- We

20:20.319 --> 20:22.287

-- F' <i>It's</i> there in <i>his kiss</i> f' -- You

20:24.623 --> 20:26.489

thinking about Cho Chang and her swim to freedom.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.390
-- F' Oh, no, that's not the way f' --
I keep thinking about 3-inch heels.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.292
-- F' And you're not listening f' -- Okay,
that's what I'm thinking about, too.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.057

<i>Welcome</i> back. And <i>say what you will,</i>

20:41.406 --> 20:43.397
but Timothy Nieuwendyk
did a yeoman's job

20:43.475 --> 20:45.273
before becoming
completely unhinged.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.834
No need to go home
unhappy, though.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.040
We've got some lovely parting
gifts for you when we come back.

20:49.114 --> 20:52.106
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.518
[Instrumental for
"It's in His Kiss" plays]

20:55.587 --> 20:57.180
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

<i>F Whoa, kiss him F</i>

21:01.460 --> 21:03.224

21:04.730 --> 21:06.425
<i>On the next "Sports Night"...</i>

21:06.498 --> 21:07.659
Elliott,
have you heard the rumor?

21:07.733 --> 21:08.928
-- Yes, I have.
-- That's 4.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.127
That's 4 people we know
who've heard the rumor.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.692
There's no ratings guy.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.330
-- 5 people have heard the rumor.
-- 5 people are wrong.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.965
The rumor <i>is</i> true.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.736
Hillary Clinton
thinks I'm an idiot!

21:17.809 --> 21:20.335
His name's Sam Donovan.
He's supposed to be very good.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.313
I'm not lacking in confidence,
as far as that's concerned,

21:23.382 --> 21:25.373
and because of that,
I can say this --

21:25.450 --> 21:28.545
I honestly don't give a damn
if any of you work here or not.
