00:49.514 --> 00:51.450
Hey, look! Over there!

00:52.318 --> 00:53.519
Wow!

00:55.386 --> 00:56.889
Their ship is so big.

00:57.022 --> 00:58.458
Wish ours
was that fancy.

00:58.557 --> 01:01.493
I'd be so happy
if ours was that fancy.

01:01.626 --> 01:02.928
- 'Cause then...
- Why is that?

01:03.629 --> 01:05.965
Because it looks better?

01:06.097 --> 01:09.368
This boat has seen us
through many a storm.

01:09.501 --> 01:11.603
It may not look like much,

01:11.704 --> 01:13.339
but it has something
theirs never will.

01:13.472 --> 01:15.308
What? Wood rot and rats?

01:16.574 --> 01:18.310
Are the children
learning something, dear?

01:18.409 --> 01:19.611
It is unclear.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.281
All right,

01:21.380 --> 01:22.347
sit, children.

01:23.382 --> 01:27.020
I think it's time
that I told you the story...

01:27.353 --> 01:31.457
of Aladdin, the princess,
and the lamp.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.425
What's so special
about a lamp?

01:33.558 --> 01:35.427
Oh,
this is a magic lamp.

01:35.561 --> 01:36.863
Maybe if you sing.

01:36.995 --> 01:38.463
It's better
when you sing.

01:38.597 --> 01:41.668
No, no. No singing.
It's been a long day.

Hmm.
That's a lovely necklace.

He, uh...

Oh!

Okay.

Good monkey.

05:40.671 --> 05:41.740

05:41.839 --> 05:44.243
Whatever it is you stole
today, I don't want it.

05:44.342 --> 05:46.778
Whoa, whoa.
I didn't steal anything.

05:47.178 --> 05:49.649
It's a family heirloom
that's worth a lot.

05:49.815 --> 05:51.817
I'll give you a bag of dates
for it, nothing more.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.719
Zulla, we both know it's
worth at least three bags.

05:54.853 --> 05:56.989

05:57.089 --> 05:58.658
Go!

Hello.

06:38.697 --> 06:39.932
Oh.

06:40.031 --> 06:43.736
Are you hungry?
Here, take some bread.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.075
Hey! Hey!

06:49.207 --> 06:50.642
You steal from my brother.

06:50.776 --> 06:53.346
- Stealing? No, I...
- You pay, or I take bracelet.

06:53.445 --> 06:56.381
Sir, I don't have any money.
Let go of me!

06:56.714 --> 06:58.950
- No.
- Whoa! Take it easy, Jamal.

06:59.084 --> 07:00.953
Kalil walks away
from the stall...

07:01.086 --> 07:03.923
and this one,
she steals the bread.

07:04.055 --> 07:05.757
Those children
were hungry!

07:05.890 --> 07:08.093
- I...
- Okay, give me a minute.

07:08.426 --> 07:12.864
You keep your little street
rat nose out of it! Huh?

07:14.466 --> 07:15.735
Do you have any money?

07:16.101 --> 07:17.103
No.

07:17.202 --> 07:18.837
Okay, trust me.

07:23.808 --> 07:25.043
- Here you go.
- Wait!

07:25.144 --> 07:26.112
This is what you wanted,
right?

07:26.212 --> 07:27.880
Yeah. Thank you.

07:27.979 --> 07:29.381
Okay, and an apple.
For your troubles.

07:29.714 --> 07:31.049
- Nice!
- That was my...

07:31.183 --> 07:32.385
I'm not leaving
without my bracelet!

07:32.485 --> 07:33.653
You mean this bracelet?

07:34.752 --> 07:35.854
Come on.

07:42.894 --> 07:44.730
Aladdin!
Thief with Aladdin!

07:45.029 --> 07:47.166
- Are we in trouble?
- Only if you get caught.

07:47.298 --> 07:48.933
- Aladdin!
- Down that alley.

07:49.034 --> 07:50.002
Monkey knows the way.

07:50.168 --> 07:52.238
- Guards! Guards!
- Abu.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.240
- Uh...
- You'll be fine.

07:55.373 --> 07:56.409
They stole from me!

07:57.142 --> 07:59.445
- Over there! Aladdin!
- Hey, you!

second is enough?

Of course.

to be sultan.

12:43.294 --> 12:45.564
The sacrifices that I've made,
the bodies that I've buried?

12:46.230 --> 12:49.100
The five years
spent in a Shirabad jail?

12:49.233 --> 12:50.703
People need to understand

12:50.802 --> 12:52.503
that they will pay
for underestimating me.

Second is not enough!
And it will never be enough!

12:55.773 --> 12:59.043

Jumping buildings.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.285
- That was incredible.
- Tea?

14:13.847 --> 14:17.823
Thank you. And thank you
for getting me out of there.

14:19.123 --> 14:20.425
Aladdin, isn't it?

14:21.559 --> 14:22.560
Uh, you're welcome...

14:23.194 --> 14:25.197
I'm... I'm Dalia.

14:25.329 --> 14:26.431
Dalia.

14:27.464 --> 14:28.466
From the palace.

14:29.767 --> 14:30.768
How could you tell?

14:30.901 --> 14:33.305
Well, only someone
from the palace

14:33.405 --> 14:35.374
could afford a bracelet
like that.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.642
And that silk lining
is imported, too.

14:37.775 --> 14:39.310
It comes
from the merchant boats,

14:39.411 --> 14:40.512
straight to the palace.

14:40.612 --> 14:42.613
But not to servants.

14:42.747 --> 14:44.416
At least, not most servants,

14:44.516 --> 14:47.453
which means you are
a handmaid to the princess.

14:49.286 --> 14:50.288
Impressive.

14:50.421 --> 14:52.324
You think that's impressive,

14:52.424 --> 14:54.126
you should see the city
from up there.

14:54.225 --> 14:55.259
Oh.

14:59.564 --> 15:02.767
Agrabah. It's so beautiful.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.368
I should get out more.

15:04.801 --> 15:07.438
You should tell the
princess to get out more.

15:07.571 --> 15:09.874
The people haven't
seen her in years.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.709
They won't let her.

15:12.676 --> 15:14.146
Ever since my...

15:15.512 --> 15:19.317
The queen was killed,
the sultan's been afraid.

15:19.450 --> 15:20.886
So she's kept locked away.

15:21.219 --> 15:22.887
Seems everyone's
been afraid since then.

15:22.988 --> 15:26.190
But the people of Agrabah
had nothing to do with that.

15:26.324 --> 15:27.325
The people loved her.

15:28.325 --> 15:30.262
They did, didn't they?

15:31.930 --> 15:33.765
Is this yours?

15:33.897 --> 15:36.468
It's kind of borrowed.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.776
My mother taught me
that song.

15:47.377 --> 15:48.379
Mine too.

15:48.746 --> 15:50.449
It's all I remember of her.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.218
And what about your father?

15:53.618 --> 15:55.653
I lost them both
when I was young.

15:55.786 --> 15:57.689
Been on my own ever since.

15:57.821 --> 15:59.490
It's all right, it's just...

15:59.656 --> 16:00.825
What?

16:01.325 --> 16:02.627
It's a little sad.

16:03.661 --> 16:04.662
Having a monkey

16:04.761 --> 16:06.297
as the only parental
authority in your life.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.269
We get by.

16:11.369 --> 16:14.472
Every day I just think
things will be different...

16:14.605 --> 16:16.541
but it never
seems to change.

16:17.908 --> 16:20.178
It's just sometimes,
I feel like I'm...

16:20.278 --> 16:21.245
Trapped.

16:22.980 --> 16:26.417
Like you can't escape
what you were born into?

16:27.551 --> 16:28.921
Yes.

16:30.521 --> 16:31.522
Hmm.

16:32.924 --> 16:34.593
Welcome Prince Anders!

16:35.493 --> 16:36.828
I have to get back
to the palace.

16:37.328 --> 16:38.797
Uh... Now?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.534
Make way
for Prince Anders!

16:42.633 --> 16:45.269
Make way for Prince Anders!

16:45.802 --> 16:48.873
It's just another prince
coming to court the princess.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.779
Yes, and I have
to get her ready.

16:53.911 --> 16:55.414
Oh! Do you have my bracelet?

16:55.546 --> 16:56.547
Sure.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.819
Make way
for Prince Anders.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.487
I'm sure I put it in here.

17:03.787 --> 17:04.890
Somewhere.

17:04.989 --> 17:07.392
Abu, did you take it?

17:07.525 --> 17:08.893
That was
my mother's bracelet.

17:10.795 --> 17:12.396
Yes. It's beautiful.

17:13.797 --> 17:14.799
You are a thief.

17:14.931 --> 17:17.568
- No, no. Yes, but...
- I'm so naive.

17:17.701 --> 17:18.737
- Abu.
- Excuse me.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.773
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, it's not like that!

17:22.906 --> 17:24.542
Clear the way!

17:24.709 --> 17:25.776
No! Watch it!

17:29.747 --> 17:30.983
Street rat,
get out of the way!

17:31.315 --> 17:32.883
Who do you think
you're calling a street rat?

17:33.617 --> 17:34.719
Are you talking back to me?

17:35.821 --> 17:37.856
You were born worthless
and you will die worthless.

17:38.655 --> 17:40.392
And only your fleas
will mourn you.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.430
Come on, Abu.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.665
Let's go home.

18:00.612 --> 18:04.483
<i>♪ Riffraff, street rat</i>

18:04.882 --> 18:08.653
<i>♪ I don't buy that</i>

18:09.053 --> 18:13.425
<i>♪ If only they'd look closer</i>

18:13.557 --> 18:16.994
<i>♪ Would they see a poor boy?</i>

18:17.094 --> 18:18.963
<i>♪ No, siree</i>

18:21.598 --> 18:24.068
<i>♪ They'd find out</i>

18:24.401 --> 18:30.441
<i>♪ There's so much more to me ♪</i>

18:38.716 --> 18:39.985
Abu.

18:40.884 --> 18:42.753
There's a time
that we do steal,

18:42.853 --> 18:44.389
and a time we don't.

18:44.788 --> 18:46.892
This was definitely a don't.

18:54.998 --> 18:57.102
Welcome, Prince Anders!

18:57.434 --> 18:59.770
We trust you had
an enjoyable journey.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.546
Oh, wow.

19:23.494 --> 19:28.500
Prince Anders, my daughter,
Princess Jasmine.

19:30.735 --> 19:34.406
So, why did no one tell me
of your beauty?

19:34.538 --> 19:36.107
No one mentioned yours,
either.

19:36.208 --> 19:40.011
Oh! Thank you.
They say that in Skanland.

19:40.111 --> 19:41.079
Yeah. Right?

19:44.582 --> 19:47.419
It's very, very amusing.

19:47.518 --> 19:48.553
- Is it?
- Yeah.

19:48.686 --> 19:49.921
We have the same title,

19:50.020 --> 19:51.922
yet are never
described the same way.

19:53.658 --> 19:56.461
Jasmine.

19:56.594 --> 19:57.728
Yeah.

19:58.129 --> 19:59.131
Oh.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.565
What is that?

20:02.065 --> 20:04.835
Don't tell me.

20:04.936 --> 20:07.406
It's a cat with stripes!

20:08.206 --> 20:09.574
He likes you.

20:09.739 --> 20:10.808
I know.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.744
'Cause in Skanland,
cats love me.

20:12.876 --> 20:15.012
Here, puss, puss.
Hey, puss, puss.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.914
Hey, puss, puss, puss...

20:20.817 --> 20:24.088
My sultan, our enemies
grow stronger every day...

20:24.221 --> 20:27.025
yet you allow your daughter
to dismiss Prince Anders...

20:27.124 --> 20:28.692
and a possible
military alliance.

20:28.793 --> 20:29.761
Which enemies?

20:30.495 --> 20:31.963
Shirabad continues to amass.

20:32.095 --> 20:34.900
- Shirabad is our ally.
- Was our ally!

20:35.032 --> 20:38.069
You would drag us into a war
with our oldest...

20:38.201 --> 20:39.570
And you would allow
your kingdom

20:39.671 --> 20:41.907
to sink into ruin
for mere sentiment!

20:42.007 --> 20:42.974
Jafar!

20:45.142 --> 20:48.546
Remember your place.

20:50.948 --> 20:52.651
I apologize.

20:55.519 --> 20:57.788
Forgive me, my sultan.

20:57.921 --> 20:59.958
I went too far.

21:05.529 --> 21:06.797
But...

21:08.565 --> 21:10.835
if you would
only reconsider...

21:11.701 --> 21:14.205
I think you will see...

21:15.640 --> 21:20.145
that invading Shirabad
is the right thing to do.

21:21.978 --> 21:27.552
Invading Shirabad is...

21:27.684 --> 21:28.886
Invade Shirabad?

21:32.789 --> 21:33.623
What?

21:33.725 --> 21:35.594
Why would we invade
Mother's kingdom?

21:36.794 --> 21:38.630
We would never
invade Shirabad.

21:38.763 --> 21:43.268
But an ally in Skanland
would improve our situation.

21:43.601 --> 21:48.540
Yes, if you consider giving
Prince Anders a chance.

21:48.672 --> 21:52.510
To rule? Baba,
Rajah would make a better ruler.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.546
My dear, I'm not
getting any younger.

21:54.679 --> 21:57.716
We must find you a husband,

21:57.815 --> 21:59.584
and we are running
out of kingdoms.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.820
What foreign prince could care
for our people as I do?

22:02.953 --> 22:04.055
I could lead if only...

22:04.154 --> 22:06.657
My dear,
you cannot be a sultan...

22:06.790 --> 22:08.559
because it has
never been done

22:08.660 --> 22:10.862
in the 1,000-year history
of our kingdom.

22:11.862 --> 22:16.301
I have been preparing for this
my whole life. I have read...

22:16.401 --> 22:19.137
Books? But you cannot
read experience.

22:19.269 --> 22:21.639
Inexperience
is dangerous.

22:21.771 --> 22:24.575
People left unchecked
will revolt.

22:24.709 --> 22:27.645
Walls and borders unguarded
will be attacked.

22:27.777 --> 22:29.113
Jafar is right.

22:30.146 --> 22:31.315
One day...

22:33.150 --> 22:35.019
you will understand.

22:40.157 --> 22:42.160
You may leave now.

22:59.677 --> 23:03.648
Life will be kinder to you,
Princess,

23:03.748 --> 23:05.350
once you accept
these traditions...

23:05.682 --> 23:07.952
and understand
it's better for you

23:08.053 --> 23:12.056
to be seen and not heard.

You know what to do, Abu.

Get off me, you dirty monkey!

24:49.920 --> 24:53.057

25:06.237 --> 25:07.205
Remember your place!

25:07.337 --> 25:10.474
If I hear that
one more time...

25:10.807 --> 25:12.076
Sorry, master!

25:12.209 --> 25:16.046
Another petty insult
from that small-minded fool.

25:17.047 --> 25:19.316
He sees a city
where I see an empire.

25:19.450 --> 25:20.852
Such vision.

25:21.384 --> 25:24.421
Once that lamp
sits in my hand...

25:25.789 --> 25:28.425
then I shall sit

25:28.526 --> 25:31.062
Thief.
Thief in the palace.

25:32.162 --> 25:33.498
"Thief in the palace"?

25:33.831 --> 25:36.167
That's what I said. Thief!

25:36.299 --> 25:38.135
What have you seen, Iago?

25:38.268 --> 25:40.238
Diamond in the rough.

25:58.922 --> 26:01.392
I told you,
now, come on!

26:01.525 --> 26:04.362
Bigger circles.
Bigger circles.

26:13.103 --> 26:16.106
Who's a clever boy?

26:17.040 --> 26:19.810
But, Dalia,
there has to be something I can do.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.313
A handsome prince
wants to marry you.

26:22.412 --> 26:24.181
Oh, when will
life get easier?

26:24.315 --> 26:26.551
It's not that I don't want to
marry, it's just...

26:26.883 --> 26:29.353
You want to be sultan.
But why?

26:29.486 --> 26:31.189
You remember
my mother used to say...

26:31.322 --> 26:35.325
we would only ever be as happy
as our least happy subject?

26:35.459 --> 26:39.130
If she saw what I saw today,
she would be heartbroken.

26:39.263 --> 26:42.400
She would also
want you to be safe.

26:42.533 --> 26:45.303
And clean.
I'll draw the bath.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.940
Jafar's guards
on every corner.

26:49.073 --> 26:51.008
Soon, he'd have them
invading our neighbors,

26:51.109 --> 26:53.344
risking lives, for what?

26:54.879 --> 26:55.880
I can help.

26:56.412 --> 26:58.216
I know I can.

26:58.315 --> 27:01.486
I was born to do more than
marry some useless prince.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.988
If you had to marry
a useless prince,

27:04.087 --> 27:05.923
you could certainly
do worse than this one.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.459
He's tall and handsome.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.295
And yes, he's a little dim,

27:10.394 --> 27:12.196
but you're just
getting married.

27:12.328 --> 27:14.231
It's not like
you have to talk to him.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.969
But you'd prefer that boy
from the market.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.049
Can I help you?

27:33.616 --> 27:34.618
Tea?

27:34.719 --> 27:37.154
You? You!

27:37.255 --> 27:38.289
What are you doing here?

27:38.389 --> 27:39.457
Get in here, now!

27:39.590 --> 27:41.860
I came back to return
your bracelet.

27:41.991 --> 27:43.360
My bracelet?
Where is it?

27:43.494 --> 27:44.863
On your wrist.

27:45.094 --> 27:46.296
What?

27:46.430 --> 27:48.333
Not bad.

27:48.465 --> 27:50.301
I like what she's done
with the place.

27:50.467 --> 27:52.237
How did you
get past the guards?

27:52.369 --> 27:55.440
That was challenging,
but I have my ways.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.309
While the princess is out,

27:58.409 --> 28:00.378
would you like to go
for a stroll?

28:00.510 --> 28:02.012
Have a little chat?

28:02.712 --> 28:05.215
You are unbelievable.

28:05.348 --> 28:07.417
You cannot just
break into a palace

28:07.517 --> 28:09.187
and walk around
like you own the place.

28:09.319 --> 28:10.487
If you don't have anything,

28:10.587 --> 28:12.222
you have to act like
you own everything.

28:12.690 --> 28:16.326
So, what do you say?
I did find your bracelet.

28:16.427 --> 28:18.563
You did not find it,
you stole it!

28:18.696 --> 28:20.565
Correction,
the monkey stole it.

28:21.131 --> 28:21.931
He's your monkey.

28:22.466 --> 28:25.003
He's still just a monkey.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.270
Who ordered the tea?

28:27.270 --> 28:28.272
Uh...

28:29.506 --> 28:31.075
I did.

28:33.643 --> 28:36.613
For you, Princess Jasmine.

28:38.248 --> 28:40.617
Your Majesty!

28:41.017 --> 28:42.452
Why are you being weird?

28:51.161 --> 28:54.265
Oh, I'm the princess.

28:54.398 --> 28:55.667
Yes.

28:56.065 --> 28:57.134
Mmm-hmm.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.437
And it is good to be me...

28:59.569 --> 29:03.240
with all my palaces...

29:03.373 --> 29:06.678
and wagons of gold things...

29:08.644 --> 29:13.017
and dresses
for every hour of the day.

29:15.151 --> 29:18.488
Now it is time
for my cat to be cleaned.

29:20.524 --> 29:22.026
She doesn't get out much.

29:22.392 --> 29:23.560
Mmm-hmm.

29:23.661 --> 29:24.696
Clearly.

29:26.596 --> 29:27.597
Oh.

29:28.063 --> 29:29.534
Aren't you supposed to be
in the bath?

29:32.402 --> 29:33.637
Oh, servant girl,

29:33.738 --> 29:37.107
this cat isn't
going to clean itself!

29:37.673 --> 29:40.177
But don't cats
clean themselves?

29:41.378 --> 29:42.547
You have to go now.

29:42.679 --> 29:44.681
Oh, okay. But I'm coming back
tomorrow night.

29:44.815 --> 29:46.084
What? No, you can't...

29:46.183 --> 29:48.152
Meet me in the courtyard
beside the fountain

29:48.251 --> 29:50.454
when the moon
is above the minaret.

29:51.488 --> 29:52.590
To return this.

29:57.628 --> 30:00.298
I promise.

30:08.305 --> 30:10.007
Can you believe it, Abu?

30:10.140 --> 30:13.111
The most heavily guarded
place in all of Agrabah...

30:14.344 --> 30:15.479
Evening.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.681
Evening.

30:17.848 --> 30:19.116
Evening.

30:20.316 --> 30:21.518
Guards are behind me.

30:24.555 --> 30:25.555
Hello, boys.

30:49.412 --> 30:50.414
Where am I?

30:50.747 --> 30:52.717
In a world
of trouble, boy.

30:54.218 --> 30:57.321
That bracelet,
is that what this is about?

30:58.122 --> 31:00.391
Because I didn't steal it.
The handmaid...

31:00.490 --> 31:03.493
What was a handmaid doing
wearing the queen's bracelet?

31:03.626 --> 31:05.495
The queen? No, no.

31:05.629 --> 31:07.432
She said that
it belonged to her...

31:07.564 --> 31:08.565
Mother.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.637
Well, at least she told
the truth about one thing.

31:13.769 --> 31:16.239
Are you saying
that was the princess?

31:17.908 --> 31:19.610
I was talking to the...

31:19.742 --> 31:21.445
She was toying with you.

31:22.179 --> 31:24.782
It amuses her
to meet commoners.

31:26.382 --> 31:29.187
Did you actually think
she liked you?

31:31.455 --> 31:32.590
What do they call you?

31:33.590 --> 31:34.592
Aladdin.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.228
Aladdin. People like us
must be realistic if...

31:38.328 --> 31:39.296
Us?

31:39.396 --> 31:42.099
You see,
I was once like you.

31:44.535 --> 31:46.103
A common thief.

31:47.837 --> 31:49.272
Only I thought bigger.

31:49.873 --> 31:52.375
Steal an apple
and you're a thief,

31:52.476 --> 31:54.712
steal a kingdom
and you're a statesman.

31:55.845 --> 31:57.748
Only weak men stop there.

31:58.681 --> 32:00.584
You're either the most
powerful man in the room,

32:00.684 --> 32:01.719
or you're nothing.

32:02.419 --> 32:05.590
You, you stumbled upon
an opportunity.

32:05.721 --> 32:07.557
I can make you rich.

32:08.225 --> 32:10.294
Rich enough
to impress a princess.

32:10.661 --> 32:12.630
But nothing comes for free.

32:22.471 --> 32:23.773
What would I have to do?

32:25.142 --> 32:30.581
<i>There's a cave nearby,
and in it, a simple oil lamp.</i>

32:31.480 --> 32:33.784
<i>Retrieve it for me
and I will make you</i>

32:33.883 --> 32:36.554
<i>wealthy enough
to impress a princess.</i>

32:38.988 --> 32:43.161
<i>You're nothing to her,
but you could be.</i>

32:44.228 --> 32:47.864
<i>Your life begins now, Aladdin.</i>

32:54.705 --> 32:56.407
Still waiting?

32:57.373 --> 33:00.944
No. No, I came out to...

33:04.882 --> 33:06.517
He promised.

33:09.486 --> 33:11.789
I'll be upstairs
if you need me.

33:11.921 --> 33:13.557
Good night, Dalia.

33:21.597 --> 33:23.500
The Cave of Wonders.

33:23.633 --> 33:24.701
When you enter,

33:24.800 --> 33:27.305
you will see more riches
than you ever dreamed of...

33:27.470 --> 33:31.308
gold, diamonds,
and the lamp.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.377
Bring it to me and I will
make you rich and free.

33:35.845 --> 33:36.913
But take no other treasure,

33:37.014 --> 33:39.417
no matter how sorely
you are tempted.

33:42.619 --> 33:44.589
And you will be tempted.

33:48.491 --> 33:51.528
Only one may enter here.

33:51.661 --> 33:55.432
One whose worth
lies far within.

33:55.565 --> 33:58.669
The diamond in the rough.

33:59.635 --> 34:00.738
Remember...

34:01.638 --> 34:03.274
take nothing but the lamp.

34:44.915 --> 34:46.583
Abu, don't touch.

34:46.750 --> 34:47.752
Remember?

35:36.165 --> 35:37.368
Whoa.

35:44.573 --> 35:45.675
Abu.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.913
This is a magic carpet.

35:50.147 --> 35:51.849
These really do exist.

35:52.848 --> 35:53.850
Hello, Carpet.

35:57.821 --> 36:00.658
Let's see what we can do
about your situation here.

36:15.504 --> 36:16.506
Oh, hey.

36:16.973 --> 36:18.676
Don't mention it.

36:21.111 --> 36:23.714
Abu, keep your little
monkey hands to yourself.

37:35.919 --> 37:37.054
Abu, no!

37:38.187 --> 37:41.858
You have touched
the forbidden treasure.

37:41.991 --> 37:45.562
Now you will never again...

37:45.663 --> 37:48.098
see the light of day!

38:17.060 --> 38:18.195
Carpet!

38:26.002 --> 38:28.205
Abu, jump!

38:52.661 --> 38:53.830
Could you give me a hand?

38:53.964 --> 38:55.132
First, the lamp.

38:55.265 --> 38:56.567
No, first your hand.

38:56.732 --> 38:57.868
We don't have much time.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.169
Give me the lamp.

39:05.174 --> 39:06.176
Your hand!

39:06.308 --> 39:08.578
Second no more, master.

39:08.712 --> 39:09.680
Now your hand.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.051
How about my foot?

39:14.951 --> 39:16.253
No! No!

39:24.160 --> 39:25.995
Get off me, monkey!

39:34.036 --> 39:35.872
Stop.

39:35.973 --> 39:39.209
Dirty monkey!
Second, second!

39:57.127 --> 39:58.195
Whoa.

40:00.330 --> 40:01.699
We're alive.

40:01.830 --> 40:02.865
I think.

40:03.866 --> 40:04.935
Thank you, Carpet.

40:09.739 --> 40:10.908
Abu.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.044
How did you...?

40:14.410 --> 40:16.312
You cunning little monkey.

40:19.049 --> 40:22.152
Now, all we need's a way out.

40:25.821 --> 40:28.091
Hey, Carpet, do you know
a way out of here?

40:30.026 --> 40:31.161
The lamp?

40:34.230 --> 40:36.033
What is that?

40:52.015 --> 40:55.051
Oh, great one who summons me,

40:55.152 --> 40:57.187
terrible one
who commands me...

40:57.319 --> 41:02.292
I stand by my oath,
loyalty to wishes three.

41:06.196 --> 41:10.167
I said, "Oh, great..."

41:12.000 --> 41:13.803
Excuse me,
boy, where's your boss?

41:14.404 --> 41:16.106
Help me out here.
Where's your boss?

41:16.239 --> 41:17.274
If I was gonna
talk to myself,

41:17.373 --> 41:18.709
I could've just
stayed in the lamp.

41:18.808 --> 41:19.810
Uh... Uh...

41:19.910 --> 41:21.310
Hello?

41:21.777 --> 41:22.779
I'm...

41:22.911 --> 41:24.080
Use your big boy voice.

41:24.214 --> 41:28.686
I'm talking
to a smoking blue giant?

41:28.817 --> 41:30.754
No!

41:30.853 --> 41:32.756
I am not a giant,

41:32.855 --> 41:35.859
I am a genie.
There is a difference.

41:35.991 --> 41:37.960
Giants are not real.

41:38.093 --> 41:39.862
- Where's your boss?
- Uh, my boss?

41:39.995 --> 41:42.765
Look, kid, I've been doing
this a long time, all right?

41:42.899 --> 41:45.069
There's always a guy,
you know...

41:45.201 --> 41:47.438
he's cheated somebody
or buried somebody...

41:47.770 --> 41:49.406
I mean, you get my point.
Where's that guy?

41:49.538 --> 41:52.042
I know that guy.
He's outside.

41:52.174 --> 41:57.113
So, it's just you and me
down here?

41:57.214 --> 41:59.149
And a monkey?

41:59.281 --> 42:00.883
That's your
personal business...

42:01.017 --> 42:02.852
but we gonna need to talk
about that monkey later.

42:02.986 --> 42:04.020
It's a pretty
little monkey.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.388
So, you rubbed the lamp?

42:05.788 --> 42:06.790
Uh-huh.

42:07.457 --> 42:09.960
Oh. Okay.
Hey, do you mind...

42:10.093 --> 42:11.728
if I could just stretch it out over
here, do you mind?

42:11.828 --> 42:13.497
Uh... Are you asking me?

42:13.830 --> 42:16.165
Yes. You're my master.

42:16.265 --> 42:17.934
I'm your master?

42:18.201 --> 42:19.269
Downward dog.

42:19.368 --> 42:21.799
No, no. You look like
you should be my master.

42:21.898 --> 42:24.308
Right, but that's not quite
how it works, though.

42:24.408 --> 42:26.310
How long have you been
trapped in here?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.312
'Bout thousand years.

42:28.444 --> 42:29.779
A thousand years?

42:29.913 --> 42:31.014
"A thousand years."

42:31.113 --> 42:34.484
Kid, is it me or does, like,
everything surprise you?

42:34.817 --> 42:36.754
So, you really don't know
who I am?

42:36.886 --> 42:40.858
Genie, wishes, lamp,
none of that ringing a bell?

42:42.125 --> 42:44.995
Wow! Well, that's a first.

42:45.562 --> 42:47.464
Monkey!

42:53.268 --> 42:55.004

about him. He's fine.

45:30.593 --> 45:31.560
- Aladdin.
- Yes!

45:31.694 --> 45:33.630
<i>♪ One wish or two or three</i>

45:33.763 --> 45:35.132
<i>♪ Well, I'm on the job</i>

45:35.232 --> 45:36.199
<i>♪ You big nabob</i>

45:36.298 --> 45:38.368
<i>♪ You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend</i>

45:38.467 --> 45:41.029
<i>♪ You ain't never had a friend

45:41.128 --> 45:45.107
<i>♪ You ain't never had

45:45.241 --> 45:49.579
<i>♪ Like me</i>

45:53.415 --> 45:55.718
<i>♪ You ain't never had
A friend like me ♪</i>

45:59.555 --> 46:00.957
You can clap now.

46:04.292 --> 46:06.595
No, no, no. Please, please.

46:06.728 --> 46:10.167
You can thank me outside.
In the sun.

46:10.299 --> 46:11.301
When you wish us out.

46:11.801 --> 46:13.670
So, how does it work?

46:14.536 --> 46:16.540
You're kidding, right?

46:17.540 --> 46:22.045
The whole song
was the instructions!

46:22.678 --> 46:25.549
Obviously, you can't dance
and listen at the same time.

46:25.681 --> 46:28.085
So, here's the basics.
Step one, rub the lamp.

46:28.216 --> 46:30.419
Step two, say what you want.
Step three...

46:30.685 --> 46:33.556
there is no step three.
See, it's that easy.

46:33.689 --> 46:34.657
You get three wishes...

46:34.756 --> 46:36.460
they must begin
with rubbing the lamp

46:36.560 --> 46:38.094
and saying,
"I wish." Got it?

46:38.227 --> 46:39.763
- I think so.
- Couple other rules.

46:40.096 --> 46:42.032
You can't wish for more
wishes. Three is enough.

46:42.165 --> 46:45.002
Now, I can't make
anybody love anybody or

46:45.102 --> 46:47.069
bring anybody
back from the dead.

46:47.203 --> 46:48.372
Feel free to interrupt me

46:48.471 --> 46:49.605
anytime you don't understand.

46:49.817 --> 46:51.883
I'm kidding, don't ever
interrupt me, no matter what.

46:51.982 --> 46:53.345
Now, I usually don't have to
go through all of this...

46:53.444 --> 46:55.344
because by the time
the guy gets to me,

46:55.444 --> 46:56.613
he pretty much knows
what he wants...

46:56.745 --> 46:58.781
and it generally
has to do with

46:58.881 --> 47:01.584
tons of money and power!

47:04.386 --> 47:06.689
Do me a favor,
do not drink from that cup.

47:06.790 --> 47:08.492
I promise you there is
not enough money

47:08.591 --> 47:10.626
and power on earth
for you to be satisfied.

47:10.759 --> 47:12.629
Good? So,
what's your first wish?

47:12.728 --> 47:15.698
Mmm... Well,
I have to think about it.

47:15.864 --> 47:17.767
I mean,
if there are only three...

47:18.100 --> 47:19.335
Why are there
only three anyway?

47:19.468 --> 47:21.504
I don't know, who cares?

47:22.205 --> 47:23.806
You don't know?

47:24.140 --> 47:25.142
I thought
you were all-knowing.

47:25.241 --> 47:26.475
That's 'cause
you don't listen.

47:26.776 --> 47:29.078
I never said
I was all-knowing.

47:29.178 --> 47:30.814
I said I was all-powerful.

47:30.913 --> 47:33.149
The most powerful being
in the universe.

47:33.281 --> 47:35.084
Look, whatever I don't know,

47:35.185 --> 47:36.319
I know I can learn it.

47:36.451 --> 47:37.219
Outside in the sun.

47:37.319 --> 47:38.754
Why are you playing
hard to wish?

47:38.888 --> 47:41.625
I know you can't tell,
but I am very pale.

47:41.756 --> 47:45.494
This is sky blue.
My natural pigmentation is navy.

47:45.627 --> 47:47.129
Give us some sun.

47:48.330 --> 47:51.233
Okay, Genie. I wish for you
to get us out of this cave.

47:51.334 --> 47:52.636
Boom! Booyah!

47:52.768 --> 47:55.272
He has made his first wish!

47:55.404 --> 47:57.140
Thank you for choosing
Carpets, Camels and Caravans.

47:57.306 --> 47:59.076
Please don't forget to tip
your genie on the way out.

47:59.176 --> 48:00.143
Hey.

48:00.243 --> 48:01.378
Hold yourself, kid!

48:06.649 --> 48:07.716
Whoa.

48:07.817 --> 48:10.320
Man, look at this world.

48:10.453 --> 48:13.323
It's so big!

48:13.422 --> 48:14.757
Inside the lamp,
everything is, like,

48:14.857 --> 48:17.393
brass, brass, brass!

48:17.527 --> 48:19.008
You're like,
"Oh! Is that some copper?"

48:19.107 --> 48:23.066
Nope, brass! Sorta the
problem with the genie life...

48:23.165 --> 48:27.070
phenomenal cosmic powers,
but itty-bitty living space.

48:27.169 --> 48:31.373
So, is this magic,
or are you magic?

48:31.473 --> 48:33.410
Eh, kind of a package deal.

48:36.312 --> 48:38.280
Can you warn me
before you do that?

48:38.446 --> 48:39.849
Oh, you'll get used to it.

48:40.348 --> 48:41.249
Right.

48:41.584 --> 48:44.154
So, do I have to make
all my wishes here?

48:44.286 --> 48:46.522
I mean, if I take you back
to Agrabah, won't people...?

48:46.656 --> 48:49.593
No, no, no!
I can look totally normal.

48:49.692 --> 48:50.660
Boo!

48:51.326 --> 48:52.696
Right, totally normal.

48:54.797 --> 48:55.799
Still blue.

48:58.468 --> 48:59.803
Do we need the top knot?

49:00.303 --> 49:01.705
That's my little
cherry on top!

49:01.837 --> 49:03.172
Okay, okay.

49:04.306 --> 49:07.310
So, what are you gonna wish?

49:07.944 --> 49:09.579
Oh, I haven't
thought about that.

49:09.712 --> 49:12.449
Mmm. You really
are not that guy.

49:13.315 --> 49:14.384
Okay.

49:14.484 --> 49:15.685
So, what would
you wish for?

49:15.785 --> 49:16.585
Mmm.

49:18.620 --> 49:21.524
No one's ever
asked me that before.

49:22.491 --> 49:23.893
It's an easy one, though.

49:24.593 --> 49:26.296
I'd wish to be free.

49:26.761 --> 49:28.364
To not have to say,

49:28.464 --> 49:29.598
"Poof! Can I help you?"

49:29.732 --> 49:31.434
"Poof! What would you like?"

49:31.567 --> 49:32.702
"Poof! Welcome to the lamp.

49:32.801 --> 49:33.903
"May I take your order,
please?"

49:34.370 --> 49:35.372
Freedom.

49:35.504 --> 49:36.640
I wish to be...

49:37.906 --> 49:39.441
to be human.

49:39.575 --> 49:41.310
Why don't you just
set yourself free?

49:44.480 --> 49:46.850
Carpet! Did you hear
what this boy said?

49:46.982 --> 49:49.318
Why don't I set myself free?

49:50.453 --> 49:51.755
Only way a genie
gets to be free...

49:51.886 --> 49:54.223
is if the owner of the lamp

49:54.323 --> 49:56.625
uses one of his wishes
to set him free...

49:56.759 --> 49:58.728
and the last time
that happened was, like,

49:58.828 --> 50:01.264
the fourth of Never-ary.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.937
I'll do it.
I've got three, right?

50:07.370 --> 50:08.738
Actually, you have two left.

50:08.870 --> 50:11.407
You used one to get out
of the cave. Remember?

50:11.707 --> 50:13.310
Did I? Or did you?

50:13.709 --> 50:15.812
I thought I had to be
rubbing the lamp.

50:15.911 --> 50:17.280
Okay, little street boy.

50:17.379 --> 50:19.481
Let's rewind the tape.

50:21.517 --> 50:23.852
<i>Okay, Genie. I wish...</i>

50:23.953 --> 50:26.422
Ooh! Little monkey
with the lamp trick!

50:26.555 --> 50:28.491
Never seen that one before.

50:29.591 --> 50:31.460
- I'll keep my eye on you.
- Uh-oh.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.829
At least now, I can use
my third wish to set you free.

50:35.431 --> 50:36.900
Here's the thing
about wishes...

50:37.700 --> 50:40.837
the more you have,
the more you want.

50:41.469 --> 50:43.272
That's not me.

50:43.638 --> 50:44.673
Mmm.

50:44.774 --> 50:45.841
We'll see about that.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.643
- But there is something.
- Uh-oh.

50:47.910 --> 50:48.911
Seen that face before.

50:49.712 --> 50:51.781
Who is she?
Who's the girl?

50:52.681 --> 50:53.950
She's a princess.

50:54.049 --> 50:55.484
Aw, aren't they all?

50:55.618 --> 50:58.321
"Treat your woman like
a queen," I always say.

50:58.453 --> 51:00.756
No,
she's an actual princess.

51:00.890 --> 51:02.325
Well, I already told you,

51:02.424 --> 51:04.326
I can't make anyone
love anyone, so...

51:04.460 --> 51:06.363
No, no.
We had a connection.

51:06.462 --> 51:07.397
Did they?

51:09.031 --> 51:10.033
Okay.

51:10.966 --> 51:13.469
She is smart, and kind,
and so beautiful.

51:13.602 --> 51:15.772
But she has to marry a...

51:17.073 --> 51:18.440
Hey! Can you make me
a prince?

51:19.507 --> 51:22.779
There's a lot of gray area
in "make me a prince."

51:23.745 --> 51:26.048
I could just
make you a prince.

51:26.149 --> 51:27.350
Oh, no.

51:27.450 --> 51:28.417
Right. You'd be snuggled up

51:28.516 --> 51:29.926
with that dude
for the rest of your life.

51:30.025 --> 51:31.655
Yo, y'all seen my palace?

51:31.754 --> 51:33.522
Be specific with your words.

51:33.989 --> 51:36.893
- The deal is in the detail.
- Got it.

51:36.993 --> 51:38.027
Which I don't
really understand

51:38.127 --> 51:39.328
because if she
already likes you...

51:39.462 --> 51:40.463
why change?

51:40.562 --> 51:42.732
I told you,
she has to marry a prince.

51:42.864 --> 51:44.433
I just
wanna go home, man!

51:44.567 --> 51:46.670
Okay, I can do that.

51:47.069 --> 51:48.938
An official wish this time,

51:49.038 --> 51:50.440
for those of us
who are counting...

51:50.573 --> 51:52.341
which now, I am one.

51:52.841 --> 51:55.010
Genie,
I wish...

51:55.544 --> 51:56.546
Lamp.

51:56.678 --> 51:57.713
Oh, sorry.

51:59.781 --> 52:01.984
All right. Genie...

52:02.417 --> 52:03.419
Don't hurt him, Genie!

52:04.453 --> 52:08.825
I wish to become a prince.

52:08.957 --> 52:10.759
Back up, boy.
I need some room to work.

52:11.493 --> 52:12.696
I'm about to fabulize you.

52:13.995 --> 52:15.531
Genie?

52:20.169 --> 52:22.471
Little head-spinney.
Better though, right?

52:22.904 --> 52:25.374
I think
I'm getting used to it.

52:25.507 --> 52:28.078
Okay, a prince, a prince.

52:28.410 --> 52:32.047
Obviously, the ghetto-chic
is not gonna work.

52:32.181 --> 52:34.784
I'm feeling a periwinkle.

52:34.917 --> 52:36.486
What's periwinkle?

52:36.618 --> 52:38.421
No! Chartreuse.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.955
Cerise!

52:40.723 --> 52:41.958
Ah!

52:42.058 --> 52:43.560
- The lines are all wrong.
- What is this?

52:43.893 --> 52:45.829
The color clashes
with your skin tone,

52:45.928 --> 52:46.895
the silhouette is confused.

52:47.029 --> 52:48.364
This is a big hat!

52:48.464 --> 52:50.566
No, that is not a big hat.

52:50.698 --> 52:52.735
Come on, Genie!
Gotta kick the door down!

52:52.835 --> 52:55.604
We gotta go bold and gold!

52:56.772 --> 52:57.973
No!

52:58.107 --> 53:00.110
- We've gone too far.
- Genie, you're slippin'!

53:00.210 --> 53:01.778
It's gotta be neutral
for the desert.

53:01.877 --> 53:04.080
Ivory, beige, bone, Albion.

53:04.212 --> 53:05.415
It's a little heavy.

53:07.116 --> 53:08.084
White.

53:09.618 --> 53:12.922
Oh! And the crowd goes wild!

53:13.022 --> 53:14.391
Oh!

53:14.491 --> 53:17.727
The genie!
The genie's on fire!

53:17.859 --> 53:19.562
<i>The genie's on fire, folks!</i>

53:19.694 --> 53:21.663
Don't hurt him, Genie!
Don't scald him!

53:21.997 --> 53:23.533
Somebody cool me down!

53:23.966 --> 53:26.536
Somebody put me out!
I'm too much!

53:26.636 --> 53:28.538
Ow! I'm back!

53:28.870 --> 53:31.507
- So, what do you think?
- I like it.

53:31.607 --> 53:32.875
Of course you like it, boy!
I made it!

53:33.007 --> 53:34.109
I think that's me.

53:34.243 --> 53:36.478
Strictly speaking,
it is me.

53:36.578 --> 53:37.747
I mean,
I did most of the work.

53:37.846 --> 53:38.881
You was just
standing there.

53:39.013 --> 53:40.015
But I hear you.

53:40.149 --> 53:42.152
But won't people
recognize me?

53:42.484 --> 53:43.553
Nobody'll recognize you.

53:43.685 --> 53:45.087
That's how
genie magic works.

53:45.221 --> 53:46.823
People see
what they're told to see.

53:47.189 --> 53:49.558
Right. Who am I?

53:49.692 --> 53:50.693
Who...?

53:51.694 --> 53:54.163
Prince Ali?

53:55.598 --> 53:56.800
- From?
- Duh!

53:57.098 --> 53:58.133
From Ababwa.

53:58.267 --> 54:00.002
A-bub-wha?

54:00.102 --> 54:02.571
You're not listenin'.
Ababwa.

54:03.138 --> 54:04.507
- Is that a real place?
- Yeah!

54:04.607 --> 54:06.209
Like,
everybody knows about it.

54:06.542 --> 54:07.911
It has a brochure.

54:08.042 --> 54:09.611
Little hot in the summer,
temperate in the fall.

54:09.745 --> 54:11.547
But no, I'll let you
read it en route.

54:12.681 --> 54:14.083
How are we gonna
get there?

54:15.250 --> 54:16.986
I guess
you can't ride a chimp.

54:17.553 --> 54:19.189
Don't you just love
a moonwalking monkey?

54:19.288 --> 54:21.658
Uh-uh. Hold it there, Abu.

54:21.757 --> 54:23.493
Donkey. Too small.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.095
No.

54:27.228 --> 54:28.230
Too obvious.

54:28.564 --> 54:30.098
We need somethin' robust!

54:34.870 --> 54:36.473
Relax, Abu.
It's just for a minute.

54:36.573 --> 54:37.841
Whoa.

54:38.140 --> 54:40.609
Prince Ali of Ababwa.

54:40.743 --> 54:42.578
And now,
for your entourage!

54:42.710 --> 54:44.580
What?

54:46.281 --> 54:47.716
What's happening?

54:47.850 --> 54:49.486
Genie?

55:06.000 --> 55:07.236
Clear the way!

55:07.569 --> 55:08.837
Clear the way!

59:08.910 --> 59:09.911
What are you doing?

59:10.011 --> 59:10.979
Put your arms down.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.348
I'm presenting it.

59:12.448 --> 59:13.415
Put your arms down!

59:13.832 --> 59:17.185
It's a pleasure to welcome you to
Agrabah, Prince Ali.

59:18.953 --> 59:19.955
Oh.

59:20.056 --> 59:20.823
How did you break that?

59:20.922 --> 59:22.424
I don't know,
it fell off.

59:22.524 --> 59:24.426
It's a pleasure
to meet him, probably.

59:24.527 --> 59:25.495
Uh...

59:25.865 --> 59:30.833
It's just as much a pleasure
for me, Your Highness, sir.

59:30.966 --> 59:32.768
You look very serene.

59:32.901 --> 59:35.404
That's a curtsy,
not a bow. Stand up.

59:35.536 --> 59:39.007
I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar
with Ababwa.

59:41.310 --> 59:42.779
- Well, it's north.
- It's south.

59:45.513 --> 59:49.218
Uh, we have
a north and a south.

59:49.350 --> 59:50.151
What?

59:50.252 --> 59:52.922
It's near,
if you were to go, it's...

59:53.055 --> 59:56.024
Around there, you can find it,
if you just look.

59:56.125 --> 59:57.126
Don't help me.

59:57.259 --> 01:00:00.296
The world is
changing quickly, Jafar.

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:04.033
It seems as if there is a new
country every day.

01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:07.536
Don't touch me.

01:00:08.379 --> 01:00:09.205
Don't touch me.

01:00:09.337 --> 01:00:14.042
Well, yes,
you are very wise.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:16.078
Uh, tell him
that we have gifts, please.

01:00:16.178 --> 01:00:18.547
Oh, right! We have things.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:19.882
Gifts!

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:21.417
- Did you organize this?
- Yeah!

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:26.288
Yes, here we are.

01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:28.924
Gifts coming right up!

01:00:29.056 --> 01:00:33.995
We have spices, golden camels,
and spoons, tiny spoons!

01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:35.131
Spoons!

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:36.932
How do they
make them that tiny?

01:00:37.031 --> 01:00:37.966
We have jams!

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.368
- Jams?
- Jams?

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.506
Yes, jams!
Yam jams, fig jams.

01:00:43.638 --> 01:00:45.507
- Yam jams!
- And date jams.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.845
Seedless, delicious,
exotic jams.

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:52.348
Move away from the jams.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.950
- What?
- We have jewels.

01:00:54.216 --> 01:00:58.286
Jewels!
We have them! And, uh, that!

01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.622
Over there,

01:00:59.721 --> 01:01:02.424
- hidden for suspense.
- Hmm?

01:01:02.524 --> 01:01:03.491
Whew!

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:05.260
Ta-da!

01:01:05.694 --> 01:01:08.264
- Uh...
- It's a wheel?

01:01:09.196 --> 01:01:11.399
It's, uh, very expensive.

01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:14.871
And what do you hope to buy
with this expensive?

01:01:15.002 --> 01:01:16.104
You!

01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:19.975
Wow!

01:01:20.942 --> 01:01:21.944
No! No, no, no.

01:01:22.043 --> 01:01:24.479
A moment with you,
a moment. That's not...

01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:28.317
Are you suggesting
I am for sale?

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.551
Of course...

01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:32.455
not! No, of course not!

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.623
No!

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:37.959
It's cold and it's dark
in that lamp.

01:01:38.093 --> 01:01:39.094
But I prefer it to this.

01:01:39.227 --> 01:01:40.363
Please excuse me.

01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:44.065
I need to go
and find some bread.

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:47.603
For the jams.

01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:49.906
No! That's not
what I meant. I...

01:01:50.038 --> 01:01:51.507
You did great.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.067
That's not what I meant.

01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:55.010
Just leave her alone.
You didn't do great.

01:01:55.143 --> 01:01:57.546
You will get the chance
to speak again.

01:01:58.145 --> 01:02:01.917
We hope you can
join us tonight, Prince Ali,

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.320
when we celebrate
our harvest.

01:02:04.618 --> 01:02:08.524
Of course, your serene self.

01:02:08.623 --> 01:02:10.625
We will join you.

01:02:10.759 --> 01:02:12.361
Smooth.

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:14.964
In 10,000 years...

01:02:15.997 --> 01:02:17.966
I've never been
that embarrassed.

01:02:26.475 --> 01:02:28.576
Don't worry. You are not
out of the game yet.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:30.446
Just do whatever
you'd normally do at a party.

01:02:30.578 --> 01:02:31.948
I've never been to a party.

01:02:32.681 --> 01:02:34.717
- What?
- What?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.552
Oh, you're gonna need to
go back to the room, then.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.687
You're not messing up
my night.

01:02:37.786 --> 01:02:39.321
Prince Ali.

01:02:42.256 --> 01:02:45.293
May I have a word?
Privately.

01:02:46.127 --> 01:02:48.564
This doesn't concern
your servant.

01:02:49.464 --> 01:02:53.302
Well, be over there
minding my business.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.208
I know who you are.

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:03.512
You do?

01:03:05.513 --> 01:03:07.082
Yes.

01:03:07.214 --> 01:03:09.651
You're a man of
great ambition like myself.

01:03:11.419 --> 01:03:14.055
I, uh, don't believe we've
been properly introduced.

01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:17.392
Jafar,
vizier to the sultan.

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:21.730
I could be a valuable ally to
help you get what you want.

01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:24.266
I, uh...
I will think on that.

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:25.501
I don't wanna
keep the princess waiting.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.470
Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

01:03:30.238 --> 01:03:33.042
This offer will not be on
the table for long, you see.

01:03:35.343 --> 01:03:36.712
Prince Ali.

01:03:36.844 --> 01:03:40.382
Excuse me. Prince Ali,
your presence is requested.

01:03:41.783 --> 01:03:43.786
So, I guess
that's the guy.

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:46.322
Mmm-hmm.
That's the guy.

01:03:54.629 --> 01:03:57.500
Okay, there she is.
This is your chance.

01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:58.767
You know what?

01:03:58.866 --> 01:04:01.737
There are a lot of people.
I don't think I can do this.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:03.472
- You'll be fine.
- Okay.

01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:05.274
This one's gonna be easy.

01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:08.777
Ooh! And look
at her handmaid.

01:04:11.145 --> 01:04:12.348
And she's going
to get some punch.

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.549
Feelin' a little
thirsty myself.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:15.351
No! No, no!
You can't leave me.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:16.619
They'll see
right through me.

01:04:16.718 --> 01:04:19.354
No, they won't.
All you have to do is walk over there.

01:04:19.453 --> 01:04:21.556
And speak.
I also have to speak.

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:23.192
Okay, listen to me.

01:04:23.725 --> 01:04:25.627
- I live in a lamp.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:25.727 --> 01:04:27.128
This is a party.

01:04:27.261 --> 01:04:29.364
Do not mess this up
for me. Okay?

01:04:29.497 --> 01:04:31.399
I like to party.

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:33.268
Go get her!

01:04:34.502 --> 01:04:36.504
Okay.

01:04:42.944 --> 01:04:45.613
Princess Jasmine!

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:47.649
You? You're still here?

01:04:47.781 --> 01:04:48.783
Yes.

01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:55.391
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:56.826
What are you doing?

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.396
I'm just making sure the
water is a good temperature.

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:01.630
Why are you not over there?

01:05:01.763 --> 01:05:04.100
How am I supposed to
compete with that?

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.368
Look at him.
He's so princely.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.269
You have got to be
more confident

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.772
about what you have to offer.

01:05:09.904 --> 01:05:11.473
What do I have to offer?

01:05:11.605 --> 01:05:13.308
Knowledge of
how to steal food?

01:05:13.408 --> 01:05:15.276
How to jump
between buildings?

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:16.879
Now, Prince Ali,
he has jewels.

01:05:16.978 --> 01:05:18.714
No, stop, stop, stop!

01:05:20.448 --> 01:05:23.786
I made you look like a prince
on the outside.

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.888
But I didn't change anything
on the inside.

01:05:27.656 --> 01:05:29.757
Prince Ali got you
to the door...

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.360
but Aladdin has to open it.

01:05:32.893 --> 01:05:34.162
Oh.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.864
See, the sultan
does like me!

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.901
Okay, well, maybe
he'll let you be his wife.

01:05:40.435 --> 01:05:44.507
Look at that, another prince
more interested in Baba.

01:05:44.638 --> 01:05:46.307
I don't know,
I think this one might be different.

01:05:47.509 --> 01:05:49.879
And he comes with an
incredibly attractive friend.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.514
Please make it work.

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.617
And what about Prince Ali?

01:05:55.216 --> 01:05:57.385
Oh, look at him.
He's trying so hard.

01:05:58.553 --> 01:05:59.888
And that's the problem.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.457
- Showtime.
- No.

01:06:01.556 --> 01:06:02.658
I'm waiting
for the right moment.

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:04.727
No. No waiting.
We're done waiting.

01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:06.661
No, I'm in charge. Okay?

01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:08.596
I say when
it's the right moment.

01:06:13.368 --> 01:06:14.603
Really? Really?

01:06:16.904 --> 01:06:19.941
He's here.
Say something, act natural.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.244
Hi!

01:06:23.645 --> 01:06:28.184
I'm sorry for the jams,
and the jewels...

01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:30.451
and the buying you.

01:06:30.585 --> 01:06:33.422
That wasn't me. It was me,
I don't...

01:06:33.555 --> 01:06:36.859
It was me, I don't have a
twin or anything, but I...

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:38.661
Um...

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.329
Dance? I'd love to.

01:06:40.995 --> 01:06:42.198
Yes.

01:06:44.498 --> 01:06:45.701
Dance?

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:47.203
Just dance.

01:06:48.736 --> 01:06:51.439
Go. Go.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.654
Relax.

01:09:01.135 --> 01:09:03.438
Bravo! Well done!

01:09:11.112 --> 01:09:13.549
Something very strange
about him.

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:17.920
Keep a close eye
on Prince Ali.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:22.491
She just walked out.

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:25.394
Maybe I went a tad far
with the back flip...

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.996
but that dance
may be the best thing

01:09:28.095 --> 01:09:29.430
you ever do in your life!

01:09:29.964 --> 01:09:31.433
I was pretty good.

01:09:31.532 --> 01:09:33.401
But nothing seems
to impress her.

01:09:33.535 --> 01:09:37.473
Yeah, it's crazy.
Not gems or jams or jewels.

01:09:37.604 --> 01:09:40.675
If I can't impress her,
I wonder who can.

01:09:41.776 --> 01:09:42.911
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:09:43.044 --> 01:09:46.581
I'm just sayin'
try being yourself.

01:09:46.714 --> 01:09:48.884
But she has to
marry a prince.

01:09:48.983 --> 01:09:51.519
If I just had
a few more minutes with her,

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.621
I know I could...

01:09:53.854 --> 01:09:54.922
You need to get me
over there.

01:09:55.055 --> 01:09:56.157
Is that an official wish?

01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:58.861
No. It's a favor.
For a friend.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:01.864
Oh, yeah, see, genies don't
really have friends.

01:10:01.996 --> 01:10:04.032
I thought you said you never
had a friend like me.

01:10:04.165 --> 01:10:07.769
No, I said you never had
a friend like me!

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.739
When you're a genie,
somebody always wants

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.608
something from ya.
It's awkward.

01:10:12.739 --> 01:10:14.510
You're right,
you're right.

01:10:14.642 --> 01:10:16.545
Besides,
it would've involved

01:10:16.644 --> 01:10:18.580
distracting
a certain handmaiden...

01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:20.848
Ooh! Ha!
I see what you're doing!

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:22.651
You hooked me.
See you there?

01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:31.826
Good evening.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.694
How did you get past
the guards?

01:10:34.194 --> 01:10:36.598
Oh, uh, I snuck past.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:37.832
All 48 of them?

01:10:37.965 --> 01:10:40.635
Even the ones that eat fire?
Impressive.

01:10:40.768 --> 01:10:43.872
Yes, well, that's what people
say about me!

01:10:44.906 --> 01:10:47.943
Well, that didn't come out
the right way.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:50.045
No one says that.
I don't know why I said that.

01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:51.145
Uh...

01:10:52.179 --> 01:10:54.849
They're beautiful!
She will hate them.

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:58.554
Tell Prince Ali the way to
her heart is through her mind.

01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:02.089
Oh, actually, these are
from me to you.

01:11:04.759 --> 01:11:06.528
Could you excuse me
one moment?

01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:08.763
Wait, no, just...

01:11:13.301 --> 01:11:16.804
"That's what people say
about me." Come on, Genie!

01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:20.709
My favorites. I accept.
Please continue.

01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:25.613
I was noticing
how pleasant the evening is.

01:11:25.746 --> 01:11:29.116
At the party,
I noticed you noticing...

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:32.621
how pleasant I am.

01:11:33.654 --> 01:11:35.056
Right. How's this going?

01:11:35.223 --> 01:11:38.260
It's clumsy,
but in a charming sort of a way.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:39.795
A stroll.

01:11:41.763 --> 01:11:44.867
Would you like to take
an evening stroll?

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.504
Just the two of us?
On purpose?

01:11:48.635 --> 01:11:50.671
Yes, as people.

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:52.908
Just one more second.

01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:54.276
Okay.

01:11:54.908 --> 01:11:56.911
Why would I say
"as people"?

01:11:57.045 --> 01:11:58.814
That kid is contagious!

01:12:01.049 --> 01:12:02.050
Go.

01:12:05.153 --> 01:12:07.723
I've never done this before.
How does it work?

01:12:08.288 --> 01:12:10.692
- Do you like sheep cheese?
- Uh...

01:12:15.162 --> 01:12:16.598
Come in.

01:12:16.898 --> 01:12:18.634
Actually,
I'm already in.

01:12:19.634 --> 01:12:20.736
Don't move.

01:12:23.938 --> 01:12:26.141
I just came back
because you left so...

01:12:26.273 --> 01:12:28.242
How did you get there?

01:12:30.278 --> 01:12:31.647
Magic carpet?

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:35.617
Actually, I'm glad
you are here.

01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:37.152
You are?

01:12:37.285 --> 01:12:39.121
I've been trying
to find Ababwa,

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.723
but it doesn't seem to be
on any of my maps.

01:12:43.123 --> 01:12:44.158
Care to show me?

01:12:45.026 --> 01:12:46.094
I'd love to.

01:12:47.795 --> 01:12:49.665
Rajah,
let's not eat the prince today.

01:12:49.764 --> 01:12:51.567
He needs his legs
for dancing.

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.937
Did I go too far
with the back flip?

01:12:55.068 --> 01:12:56.237
A little.

01:12:58.206 --> 01:13:00.242
- Ababwa?
- Yes.

01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:01.777
Genie,
I need to find Ababwa.

01:13:01.876 --> 01:13:02.977
My other brother...

01:13:03.077 --> 01:13:04.345
the short one,
not the one

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:06.648
who gifted me a goat,
he's married...

01:13:06.747 --> 01:13:09.183
She has maps, lots of maps.

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:12.086
Ababwa, of course.

01:13:17.224 --> 01:13:18.225
Ababwa.

01:13:18.358 --> 01:13:20.761
Yak napkins
are not easy to find...

01:13:35.009 --> 01:13:36.310
Have you lost your country?

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:40.047
My country?
No, no.

01:13:40.148 --> 01:13:41.116
Uh...

01:13:44.285 --> 01:13:45.787
There it is.

01:13:45.886 --> 01:13:49.090
I don't think so.
I've been...

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.228
There it is.

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:55.931
How did I not see that?

01:13:56.063 --> 01:13:57.798
Who needs maps
anyway?

01:13:57.931 --> 01:14:01.636
They're old and useless,
and add no practical value.

01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:03.805
Maps are how I see the world.

01:14:04.138 --> 01:14:06.774
I thought a princess
could go anywhere.

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:09.810
Not this princess.

01:14:12.947 --> 01:14:15.317
Well,

01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:17.084
would you wanna...?

01:14:17.184 --> 01:14:19.187
Oh. Uh...

01:14:19.287 --> 01:14:20.856
Sorry, sorry.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:23.792
Rajah!

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.059
Oh.

01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:35.103
Thanks for that.

01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:41.042
I was saying you should
see these places.

01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:45.814
I mean, there's a whole world
outside of books and maps.

01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:49.283
Do you want to?

01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:52.120
How? Every door is guarded.

01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:54.755
Who said anything
about a door?

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:56.024
What are you doing?

01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:58.727
Sometimes, Princess...

01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:02.864
sometimes, you just
have to take a risk.

01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:09.071
What just happened?

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.111
What?

01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:19.114
Is this...?

01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:20.848
A magic carpet?

01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:23.485
Do you trust me?

01:15:24.484 --> 01:15:25.853
What did you say?

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.289
Do you trust me?

01:15:33.227 --> 01:15:34.395
Yes.

Of all the places
you've shown me,

this is by far
the most beautiful.

01:18:26.267 --> 01:18:27.535
Sometimes,
you just have to see it

01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:28.637
from a different
perspective.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:32.908
It's them, the people.
They make it beautiful.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.542
And they deserve a leader
who knows that.

01:18:35.675 --> 01:18:37.544
I don't know why
I think it could be me.

01:18:37.678 --> 01:18:39.314
Because it should be you.

01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:41.283
You think so?

01:18:42.483 --> 01:18:43.685
Does it matter
what I think?

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:54.194
Oh, look at that adorable
monkey down there.

01:18:54.295 --> 01:18:55.062
Is that Abu?

01:18:55.162 --> 01:18:57.232
No, no,
it couldn't be Abu, he's...

01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:05.473
So, how many names
do you have, Prince Aladdin?

01:19:06.072 --> 01:19:07.142
No, no, I...

01:19:07.273 --> 01:19:08.442
So who is Prince Ali?

01:19:09.109 --> 01:19:11.278
I am Prince Ali.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:13.315
But how would you
know the city so well?

01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:15.150
I came to Agrabah early...

01:19:15.282 --> 01:19:16.985
because to know a people,

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.219
you have to see them
for yourself.

01:19:18.318 --> 01:19:19.987
But you already
know that.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:23.391
When we first met,
you were disguised in your own city.

01:19:23.523 --> 01:19:25.225
You saw us arrive

01:19:25.326 --> 01:19:28.363
with dancers, an elephant,
and a magic carpet.

01:19:28.496 --> 01:19:30.398
How could a street thief
have all that?

01:19:30.531 --> 01:19:33.001
But how could I not
recognize you?

01:19:34.201 --> 01:19:36.337
People don't see the real you
when you're royalty.

01:19:39.372 --> 01:19:42.410
I'm sorry.
I'm embarrassed.

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:45.113
I mean, you've seen
more of Agrabah in days

01:19:45.212 --> 01:19:47.247
than I have
in an entire lifetime.

01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:52.086
We should...

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:56.357
probably head back.

01:19:57.757 --> 01:19:59.426
Already?

01:20:08.435 --> 01:20:10.270
Until tomorrow, Princess.

01:20:25.618 --> 01:20:26.653
Good night.

01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:30.692
Good night.

01:20:35.563 --> 01:20:36.598
Yes!

01:20:43.837 --> 01:20:46.174
Fascinating.

01:20:49.343 --> 01:20:50.511
Ooh.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.614
I like that face.
Good date?

01:20:52.746 --> 01:20:54.049
The best.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.283
But it was better
than the best.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:59.486
She figured out I was Aladdin.
You said that wouldn't happen.

01:20:59.586 --> 01:21:03.491
Wow! I mean, genie magic
is really just a facade.

01:21:03.623 --> 01:21:05.193
At some point,

01:21:05.292 --> 01:21:07.694
real character's always
gonna shine through.

01:21:07.827 --> 01:21:09.663
But that's a good thing,
right? Now, she knows.

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:11.266
Well...

01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:12.567
Well, what?

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:13.701
He told me he was only

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.370
pretending to be a thief
to see the city...

01:21:15.469 --> 01:21:17.238
but he's actually
a prince.

01:21:17.337 --> 01:21:19.607
I convinced her that
I really was a prince.

01:21:19.739 --> 01:21:20.774
And you believed him?

01:21:20.907 --> 01:21:22.109
And she believed you?

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.211
I think so.

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:27.515
Eventually, you are going to
have to tell her the truth.

01:21:27.648 --> 01:21:30.618
Eventually,
I will tell her.

01:21:31.352 --> 01:21:34.855
Anyway,
I sort of am a prince now.

01:21:35.322 --> 01:21:36.391
Oh!

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:39.127
So, you're gonna drink
from that cup.

01:21:40.227 --> 01:21:42.330
You don't think maybe
you want to believe him...

01:21:42.429 --> 01:21:43.697
because you have to
marry a prince,

01:21:43.797 --> 01:21:45.332
but you can't marry a thief?

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:49.636
No, I believe him. I do.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:22:00.314
When the time is right,
I will tell her.

01:22:05.352 --> 01:22:06.354
Morning.

01:22:06.854 --> 01:22:08.323
Morning.

01:22:11.658 --> 01:22:12.759
Not again.

01:22:16.897 --> 01:22:18.800
Please, please.

01:22:19.366 --> 01:22:22.636
Gentlemen, I think there's
been some sort of confusion.

01:22:22.769 --> 01:22:24.438
I don't think you know
who I am.

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:25.707
Oh, no, no.

01:22:25.806 --> 01:22:27.541
I know who you are.

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.611
Aladdin.

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:30.778
Aladdin?

01:22:30.911 --> 01:22:32.212
Aladdin.

01:22:32.311 --> 01:22:34.349
I don't know who that is.
I'm Prince Ali...

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.184
- Street rat!
- ...of Ababwa.

01:22:36.283 --> 01:22:38.486
Prince from a kingdom
that doesn't exist...

01:22:38.618 --> 01:22:41.389
who now possesses
a magic carpet

01:22:41.488 --> 01:22:43.257
from the Cave of Wonders.

01:22:43.389 --> 01:22:44.691
Seems to me, the only way
that's possible...

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:45.759
Where's your monkey?

01:22:45.858 --> 01:22:47.362
...is if you found
a certain treasure.

01:22:49.429 --> 01:22:50.597
My treasure.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.334
Where's the lamp?

01:23:01.474 --> 01:23:03.678
There's clearly been some
sort of misunderstanding.

01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:04.879
I'm Prince Ali.

01:23:05.011 --> 01:23:06.915
If I throw you
off of that balcony,

01:23:07.848 --> 01:23:10.350
and you are
who you say you are...

01:23:11.352 --> 01:23:13.421
you will die
a watery death.

01:23:15.889 --> 01:23:18.660
If you survive,
it can only be because of the lamp.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.895
In which case,
I will have my answer.

01:23:23.397 --> 01:23:24.799
For the last time...

01:23:29.036 --> 01:23:31.806
where is the lamp?

01:23:31.938 --> 01:23:35.843
Listen to me. I don't know
who you think I am.

01:23:35.975 --> 01:23:37.277
Goodbye, Aladdin.

01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:38.712
No! No!

01:24:01.801 --> 01:24:02.903
Hmm.

01:24:43.609 --> 01:24:44.978
Boy, what in the...?

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.716
Whoa. Hey, kid, okay.

01:24:48.815 --> 01:24:50.718
I can't get you out of this
unless you make a wish!

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.888
You have to make a wish!
Come on, wake up!

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.457
Okay, try and form the words
"I wish."

01:24:57.590 --> 01:25:00.961
Kid, come on, wake up!
Wake up.

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.864
You need to think.
Think, think.

01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:04.931
Think.

01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:07.869
Okay, okay!
A little gray area here,

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:10.004
but it's worth a try.

01:25:10.104 --> 01:25:12.640
"I, Aladdin,
being of sound body and mind...

01:25:12.773 --> 01:25:14.776
"declare that my second wish

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:17.011
"is to be saved
from certain doom."

01:25:17.144 --> 01:25:18.913
I took the liberty
to backdate that a day.

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:19.947
I hope you don't mind.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.948
Yes! Here we go! Come on!

01:25:32.593 --> 01:25:35.063
Come on, kid! Come on!
Kid? Kid? Kid, please.

01:25:35.395 --> 01:25:37.799
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up, wake up!

01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:40.634
Kid, wake up.

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:41.803
Please.

01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:43.870
Ew.

01:25:46.572 --> 01:25:49.410
Probably could've done that
the other direction, but...

01:25:53.413 --> 01:25:54.415
How you doing?

01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:56.584
Thanks, Genie.

01:25:56.716 --> 01:25:59.821
Hey, no problem, you know.
I was in the neighborhood.

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.888
I thought you said no favors.

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.692
I thought you said no friends.

01:26:05.058 --> 01:26:09.430
Right. Um... It actually
cost you a wish.

01:26:10.997 --> 01:26:15.402
Whatever it cost,
you saved my life.

01:26:15.536 --> 01:26:16.671
Yeah, that's true.

01:26:17.004 --> 01:26:20.006
I mean, strictly speaking
though, it was a team effort.

01:26:23.743 --> 01:26:24.845
Thank you.

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.882
We have to stop Jafar.

01:26:29.215 --> 01:26:30.884
That's not gonna be easy.

01:26:31.018 --> 01:26:32.953
The sultan trusts him
completely.

01:26:33.086 --> 01:26:35.490
He has everybody fooled.

01:26:37.657 --> 01:26:39.826
Maybe not everyone.

01:26:41.798 --> 01:26:44.031
I overheard Prince Ali
talking to his advisor...

01:26:44.163 --> 01:26:46.600
about returning with an army
to conquer Agrabah.

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:47.635
What?

01:26:47.734 --> 01:26:50.772
Now it appears
he's fled in the night.

01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:53.507
Jasmine.

01:26:55.541 --> 01:26:57.144
You heard him
say this, Jafar,

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:58.479
and you saw him leave?

01:26:58.578 --> 01:26:59.546
Uh-oh.

01:26:59.645 --> 01:27:03.617
Yes, with my own ears
and my own eyes.

01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:06.587
So, what's the problem
now, Princess?

01:27:07.621 --> 01:27:09.757
This is the problem, Jafar.

01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:11.858
If what you say is true,

01:27:11.959 --> 01:27:14.429
then why is Prince Ali
still here?

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.563
Your Majesty.

01:27:16.563 --> 01:27:18.565
Prince Ali.

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:21.002
This is a surprise.

01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:23.770
Your Highness,
your advisor's not who he says he is.

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:25.506
Oh.

01:27:25.605 --> 01:27:26.873
I'm not who I say I am?

01:27:27.006 --> 01:27:29.844
Baba, he tried
to kill Prince Ali.

01:27:31.612 --> 01:27:34.181
Jafar, can you explain
this to me?

01:27:35.215 --> 01:27:36.217
Yes.

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:40.488
My sultan...

01:27:41.287 --> 01:27:45.125
you know my loyalty
belongs to you.

01:27:47.794 --> 01:27:49.497
Your loyalty...

01:27:50.964 --> 01:27:52.800
Your loyalty...

01:27:53.032 --> 01:27:54.468
Yes.

01:27:56.903 --> 01:28:00.207
Prince Ali, you invited
yourself into our city...

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.777
and we welcomed you
as our guest.

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:06.247
But I believe
your intentions are...

01:28:09.282 --> 01:28:10.817
...deceitful.

01:28:11.818 --> 01:28:13.554
You're a grave danger
to Agrabah

01:28:13.653 --> 01:28:14.788
and you shall be
dealt with as such.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.659
- Baba, what are you saying?
- Enough, Jasmine!

01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:22.796
Jafar told me
of Prince Ali's ambition.

01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:23.930
His staff.

01:28:24.031 --> 01:28:25.131
He's here
for my throne.

01:28:25.232 --> 01:28:26.200
Hakim!

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:37.612
Baba?

01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:39.714
What happened?

01:28:39.845 --> 01:28:40.947
He had you under a spell.

01:28:41.081 --> 01:28:43.784
He's not to be trusted,
Your Majesty.

01:28:43.916 --> 01:28:44.952
He wants your throne.

01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:48.288
Jafar! You were
my most trusted advisor.

01:28:49.755 --> 01:28:52.292
Hakim! Put him
in the dungeon!

01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:03.270
You should think
about how quickly

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:06.607
the sands of power shift
in a storm, Hakim.

01:29:06.939 --> 01:29:12.045
I am loyal to my sultan,
as you should have been.

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:17.183
The law is the law.

01:29:32.733 --> 01:29:36.003
Prince Ali,
I must apologize.

01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:40.741
Well, Your Highness,
there's something I'd like to explain.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.742
Your honor and integrity

01:29:42.843 --> 01:29:45.746
will never again be
questioned here in Agrabah.

01:29:46.179 --> 01:29:47.181
I...

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.849
A more noble
and sincere young man

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:52.219
has never graced
the chambers of this palace.

01:29:52.352 --> 01:29:53.354
Well, uh...

01:29:53.687 --> 01:29:54.889
- Wow.
- I...

01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:58.291
I would be honored
to call you my son...

01:29:58.392 --> 01:29:59.359
Ooh!

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:03.831
...if that were something
anyone wanted.

01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:06.600
So, you got the girl.

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.336
I mean, trust me,
I had my doubts

01:30:08.435 --> 01:30:10.837
after your whole jam debacle.

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:14.642
But you pulled yourself
back together a little bit.

01:30:14.774 --> 01:30:15.843
I did, didn't I?

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.945
I think I finally got the
hang of being a prince.

01:30:18.077 --> 01:30:20.080
Oh, well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

01:30:20.246 --> 01:30:22.816
You were right! People see
what they wanna see.

01:30:22.916 --> 01:30:25.685
Aladdin is gone.
I'm Prince Ali now.

01:30:25.818 --> 01:30:28.755
Wow. Got it all figured out
now, huh, kid?

01:30:28.889 --> 01:30:31.092
And, you know, I was thinking
about my last wish...

01:30:31.224 --> 01:30:34.395
and I just can't do this
without you.

01:30:34.728 --> 01:30:36.130
I know I told you
I'd use it to set you free,

01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:37.197
but you heard the sultan.

01:30:37.296 --> 01:30:39.800
I can't let everything
we worked for fall apart.

01:30:39.899 --> 01:30:42.836
So, you just
never tell her the truth?

01:30:42.969 --> 01:30:44.071
You're gonna
keep living the lie?

01:30:44.203 --> 01:30:46.706
It's not a lie.
People can change.

01:30:46.806 --> 01:30:49.175
Oh,
they can change all right.

01:30:50.176 --> 01:30:52.278
And that's a bad thing?

01:30:52.412 --> 01:30:54.849
Everything is better now.
No one got hurt.

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.282
You'd rather me be
back on the streets

01:30:56.382 --> 01:30:57.350
stealing to survive?

01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.254
I thought you'd be
happy for me.

01:31:01.321 --> 01:31:02.790
But all you cared about
was that

01:31:02.889 --> 01:31:05.091
I use my last wish
to set you free.

01:31:05.192 --> 01:31:09.330
Well, kid, I don't care
nothin' about that wish.

01:31:09.462 --> 01:31:12.867
This is about you,
what's happening to you.

01:31:12.998 --> 01:31:15.935
You'd rather lie
to somebody you love

01:31:16.036 --> 01:31:17.438
than give all of this up.

01:31:17.537 --> 01:31:18.906
You don't get it, Genie.

01:31:19.872 --> 01:31:21.942
People like me
don't get anything

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.109
except by pretending.

01:31:24.277 --> 01:31:27.214
I think maybe
you don't get it.

01:31:27.813 --> 01:31:31.251
The more you gain
by pretending,

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:33.187
the less you're actually
gonna have.

01:31:34.019 --> 01:31:38.459
In 10,000 years,
I have never once, ever...

01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:41.261
called a master a friend.

01:31:42.095 --> 01:31:45.266
I broke the rules for you,
I saved your life.

01:31:45.398 --> 01:31:47.068
And for what?

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.270
You are breaking
my heart here, kid.

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.706
You're breaking my heart.

01:31:51.837 --> 01:31:53.239
Genie, no!
Hey, come on!

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.059
Lamp. Lamp.

01:32:12.192 --> 01:32:14.028
Master. Lamp.

01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:19.032
Who does he think he is?
He's supposed to serve me.

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.936
I'm the same as I always was
on the inside. Right, Abu?

01:32:26.572 --> 01:32:27.774
Hey!

01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:50.397
Aah! Are you kidding?

01:32:50.496 --> 01:32:52.532
Now, why would you
rub the thing under the...

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.102
archway?

01:33:03.343 --> 01:33:04.545

Jafar.

01:34:00.399 --> 01:34:03.536
You should have left Agrabah
while you had the chance.

01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:06.373
Why leave when the city
belongs to me now?

01:34:06.505 --> 01:34:08.975
- It's over, Jafar.
- Oh, good for you.

01:34:09.108 --> 01:34:11.444
I've endured
your spineless incompetence

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:12.613
for long enough now.

01:34:12.946 --> 01:34:15.082
- Hakim.
- Old fool.

01:34:25.692 --> 01:34:26.894
Genie!

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:29.296
For my first wish,

01:34:29.395 --> 01:34:31.965
I wish to be
sultan of Agrabah!

01:34:32.098 --> 01:34:33.100
What?

01:34:34.067 --> 01:34:35.236
As you wish, Master.

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:36.303
No!

01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:12.605
Hakim.

01:35:13.439 --> 01:35:14.540
Hakim!

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:19.313
You obey the sultan,
so you obey me now.

01:35:24.751 --> 01:35:27.087
You know the law, Hakim!

01:35:32.157 --> 01:35:33.160
No.

01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:38.431
My sultan!

01:35:38.665 --> 01:35:39.667

01:35:42.702 --> 01:35:43.704
Hakim.

01:35:44.269 --> 01:35:46.306
Marshal an army
to invade Shirabad.

01:35:46.438 --> 01:35:47.507
- Shirabad!
- You cannot...

01:35:47.606 --> 01:35:49.809
I think we've heard enough
from you, Princess.

01:35:49.908 --> 01:35:51.010
It's time you start doing

01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:52.179
what you should have done
all along.

01:35:52.278 --> 01:35:53.714
Stay silent.

01:35:55.047 --> 01:35:57.318
Guards, remove her!

01:36:01.087 --> 01:36:04.090

what's good for you.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.595

01:36:09.395 --> 01:36:12.632
Rajah! It's all right.

01:36:19.471 --> 01:36:21.108
- Don't touch her!
- Baba.

01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:28.482

Hakim!

01:38:51.291 --> 01:38:53.160
Take her away!

01:38:54.894 --> 01:38:56.563
Tell them, Hakim.

01:39:05.505 --> 01:39:08.142
You were just a boy

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:10.244
when your father
came to work the grounds.

01:39:11.577 --> 01:39:12.778
But you have risen up

01:39:12.879 --> 01:39:16.250
to become
our most trusted soldier.

01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:19.752
As a man, I know you to be
both loyal and just.

01:39:21.821 --> 01:39:23.323
But now you have to choose.

01:39:24.756 --> 01:39:26.826
Duty isn't always honor.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.862
Our greatest challenge

01:39:28.961 --> 01:39:31.197
isn't speaking up
against our enemies...

01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:35.602
but defying those whose
approval we seek the most.

01:39:36.536 --> 01:39:41.175
Jafar is not worthy of your
admiration nor your sacrifice.

01:39:41.306 --> 01:39:45.211
I wish nothing but glory
for the kingdom of Agrabah.

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:49.183
No. You seek glory
for yourself.

01:39:49.314 --> 01:39:52.352
And you would win it
off the backs of my people!

01:39:53.286 --> 01:39:56.422
Hakim, these men,

01:39:56.523 --> 01:39:57.658
they will follow
where you lead...

01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:59.660
but it's up to you.

01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:01.294
Will you stand silent

01:40:01.394 --> 01:40:03.429
while Jafar destroys
our beloved kingdom...

01:40:03.595 --> 01:40:05.698
or will you do
what is right...

01:40:10.703 --> 01:40:13.674
and stand with the people
of Agrabah?

01:40:25.451 --> 01:40:26.486
My princess.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.392
Forgive me, my sultan.

01:40:38.464 --> 01:40:39.765
Hakim.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.870
Guards, arrest the vizier!

01:40:45.904 --> 01:40:48.341
Lamp! Rub the lamp.

01:40:48.474 --> 01:40:50.544
So, this is how it will be.

01:40:51.077 --> 01:40:52.813
Not even the title of sultan

01:40:52.912 --> 01:40:54.480
will wake the herd
from their sleep.

01:40:55.047 --> 01:40:56.782
I should've known.

01:40:56.916 --> 01:40:59.653
If you won't bow
before a sultan,

01:40:59.752 --> 01:41:01.688
you will cower
before a sorcerer.

01:41:01.821 --> 01:41:03.991
Genie! I wish to become

01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:06.026
the most powerful sorcerer
there is!

01:41:07.093 --> 01:41:09.028
As you wish, Master.

01:41:32.751 --> 01:41:35.455
This could be fun.

01:41:37.023 --> 01:41:40.661
Hakim, I had
such big plans for you.

01:41:41.661 --> 01:41:43.297
But now...

01:41:45.031 --> 01:41:46.867
you are no longer
of any use to me.

01:41:47.632 --> 01:41:49.736
Perhaps your men would like to
follow you to the dungeon.

01:41:52.805 --> 01:41:54.640
You too.

01:41:56.675 --> 01:41:58.044
Prince Ali!

01:42:00.813 --> 01:42:02.416
If it isn't our Prince Ali.

01:42:02.547 --> 01:42:04.951
- Ali!
- Or should I say...

01:42:09.956 --> 01:42:11.425
Aladdin.

01:42:14.093 --> 01:42:15.095
Aladdin.

01:42:15.428 --> 01:42:17.698
He's been pretending
the entire time.

01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:21.401
An impostor.
There is no Prince Ali.

01:42:21.533 --> 01:42:22.935
There never was.

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:24.904
He's nothing
but a lying thief.

01:42:25.037 --> 01:42:26.073
I'm sorry.

01:42:26.738 --> 01:42:28.107
You're insignificant.

01:42:28.207 --> 01:42:31.077
An irritation I no longer
need to tolerate...

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.113
once I ensure
your agonizing death

01:42:33.212 --> 01:42:36.716
by banishing you
to the ends of the earth.

01:42:37.082 --> 01:42:38.085
No!

01:42:57.002 --> 01:42:58.138
No.

01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:59.572
No!

01:43:02.841 --> 01:43:03.977
Abu.

01:43:05.111 --> 01:43:06.580
Abu!

01:43:09.081 --> 01:43:11.385
I could simply kill you all.

01:43:12.585 --> 01:43:14.587
But that would be
inadequate repayment

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.890
for years of humiliation
and neglect.

01:43:19.425 --> 01:43:22.095
"Remember your place, Jafar."
"You forget yourself, Jafar."

01:43:22.662 --> 01:43:23.463
Jafar.

01:43:23.795 --> 01:43:28.434
No, what you need, Baba,
is to suffer.

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:30.971
- Like I have suffered.
- Baba?

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:33.073
Would watching me rule
your kingdom be enough?

01:43:33.505 --> 01:43:34.507
Stop!

01:43:34.606 --> 01:43:37.109
Or watching my armies
devour your toothless ally?

01:43:37.242 --> 01:43:38.879
Please, make it stop.

01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:40.679
No, the most
suitable punishment

01:43:40.779 --> 01:43:41.747
would be to make you watch...

01:43:41.848 --> 01:43:44.084
while I take
what you love most.

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.552
No. No, please.
Baba.

01:43:45.684 --> 01:43:46.952
And marry your daughter.

01:43:47.752 --> 01:43:48.921
No!

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:50.924
No.

01:43:51.724 --> 01:43:54.895
She will never marry you.

01:43:59.931 --> 01:44:01.033
Baba.

01:44:01.166 --> 01:44:02.169
I will do as you wish!

01:44:03.635 --> 01:44:04.670
Make it stop.

01:44:07.773 --> 01:44:09.709
Make it stop.

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:16.550
Baba!
Baba, are you all right?

01:44:16.882 --> 01:44:17.983
Jasmine.

01:44:20.752 --> 01:44:21.921
Abu!

01:44:24.122 --> 01:44:25.991
Abu!

01:44:27.158 --> 01:44:28.495
Abu!

01:44:40.572 --> 01:44:42.174
Abu.

01:44:42.908 --> 01:44:45.178
Are you okay?

01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:47.147
Let's get out of here.

01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:48.914
No.

01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:22.781
Your Highness, Sultan,
in honesty and sincerity...

01:45:23.616 --> 01:45:25.185
do you accept
Princess Jasmine...?

01:45:25.318 --> 01:45:26.720
Yes.

01:45:26.852 --> 01:45:28.955
Yes, I accept.

01:45:29.087 --> 01:45:30.689
Princess.

01:45:31.023 --> 01:45:32.759
Princess Jasmine,

01:45:32.858 --> 01:45:35.594
do you accept the sultan
to be your husband?

01:45:41.166 --> 01:45:42.167
Come on, woman.

01:45:43.301 --> 01:45:44.304
Accept.

01:45:44.403 --> 01:45:45.571
I...

01:45:50.843 --> 01:45:51.845
Yes?

01:45:52.278 --> 01:45:53.280
I...

01:45:55.648 --> 01:45:56.650
do not!

01:45:56.849 --> 01:45:58.652
The lamp! The lamp!

01:45:58.751 --> 01:45:59.986
Stop her!

01:46:00.118 --> 01:46:02.621
No, Jasmine! No!

01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:04.724
No! No!

01:46:11.063 --> 01:46:12.565
The lamp! Iago!

01:46:12.898 --> 01:46:14.734
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:46:26.112 --> 01:46:27.614
Hold on!

01:46:33.285 --> 01:46:34.287
The lamp!

01:46:35.121 --> 01:46:36.156
Abu!

01:46:56.809 --> 01:46:58.078
The lamp!

01:47:05.084 --> 01:47:06.353
Carpet, get me up there!

01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:10.223
Abu!

01:47:15.361 --> 01:47:16.696
Jump!

01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:31.778
No!

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:47.260
You're nothing
without your staff!

01:47:47.359 --> 01:47:48.327
Nothing!

01:48:16.522 --> 01:48:17.724
The lamp!

01:48:24.897 --> 01:48:25.931
Carpet!

01:48:38.309 --> 01:48:39.379
Jasmine.

01:48:43.983 --> 01:48:45.752
Punish them. Punish them.

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.355
Genie should witness.

01:48:56.595 --> 01:48:57.964
As the old man said...

01:48:58.063 --> 01:49:00.867
you should've left Agrabah
when you had the chance.

01:49:10.975 --> 01:49:13.946
I told you before
to think bigger.

01:49:14.078 --> 01:49:16.116
You could've been the most
powerful man in the room.

01:49:16.447 --> 01:49:18.450
But now I hold the lamp.

01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:20.353
I hold the power.

01:49:24.823 --> 01:49:26.326
You can't find
what you're looking for

01:49:26.425 --> 01:49:27.960
in that lamp, Jafar.

01:49:28.093 --> 01:49:30.162
I tried and failed,
and so will you.

01:49:30.295 --> 01:49:32.898
You think so,
but I am sultan!

01:49:33.866 --> 01:49:37.002
I am the greatest sorcerer
the world has ever seen.

01:49:37.169 --> 01:49:41.440
I will create an empire
that history cannot ignore.

01:49:41.573 --> 01:49:45.077
I can destroy cities.

01:49:46.077 --> 01:49:49.081
I can destroy kingdoms.

01:49:54.086 --> 01:49:56.523
And I can destroy you.

01:49:56.622 --> 01:49:57.790
True.

01:49:58.389 --> 01:49:59.959
But who made you a sultan?

01:50:01.126 --> 01:50:02.295
Who made you a sorcerer?

01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:05.165
There will
always be something,

01:50:05.264 --> 01:50:07.132
some man, some being...

01:50:07.265 --> 01:50:09.067
- more powerful than you.
- What are you doing?

01:50:09.167 --> 01:50:10.804
Genie gave you your power,

01:50:10.903 --> 01:50:12.004
and he can take it away.

01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:13.939
- He serves me!
- For now.

01:50:14.072 --> 01:50:16.075
But you'll never have
more power than the genie.

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:23.516
You said it yourself.

01:50:23.648 --> 01:50:26.486
You're either most powerful
in the room...

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:28.321
or you're nothing.

01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:32.858
You'll always be second.

01:50:33.091 --> 01:50:35.127
Second! Second!

01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:39.232
Second?

01:50:39.631 --> 01:50:42.000
Only second?

01:50:42.134 --> 01:50:44.504
He serves me!

01:50:46.671 --> 01:50:50.242
I will make sure no one will
ever say these words again.

01:50:50.509 --> 01:50:51.511
Genie!

01:50:52.583 --> 01:50:54.413
For my final wish,
I wish to become

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:57.217
the most powerful being
in the universe.

01:50:57.349 --> 01:50:58.985
More powerful than you!

01:51:00.118 --> 01:51:04.156
A lot of gray area
in that wish, but, uh...

01:51:04.256 --> 01:51:07.926
most powerful being
in the universe

01:51:08.027 --> 01:51:09.162
coming right up!

01:51:34.319 --> 01:51:38.190
The most powerful
in the universe, at last...

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:40.326
second to no one.

01:51:40.459 --> 01:51:43.328
And I thought
I had power before!

01:51:44.095 --> 01:51:48.667
First, I'll lay waste
to those fools in Shirabad.

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.184
What have you done to me?

01:52:05.317 --> 01:52:07.020
I haven't done anything
to you, Jafar.

01:52:07.152 --> 01:52:08.688
What have you done to me?

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.989
This was your wish, not mine.

01:52:12.157 --> 01:52:14.294
A genie might have
phenomenal cosmic powers...

01:52:14.425 --> 01:52:17.129
But an itty-bitty
living space.

01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:20.366
You see,
a genie without a master

01:52:20.465 --> 01:52:21.934
goes back in their lamp.

01:52:22.267 --> 01:52:25.237
No! Not the lamp!

01:52:27.105 --> 01:52:28.707
I will not forget you, boy!

01:52:29.041 --> 01:52:30.276
Mark my words,

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:32.478
I will not forget
what you have done to me!

01:52:32.611 --> 01:52:33.613
Goodbye, Jafar!

01:52:34.045 --> 01:52:36.281
Parrot! You're coming with me!

01:52:36.581 --> 01:52:39.184
No!

01:52:54.632 --> 01:52:56.001
Baba.

01:52:56.135 --> 01:52:57.403
- Baba.
- Come on.

01:52:57.502 --> 01:52:59.471
Couple thousand years
in the Cave of Wonders

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:00.672
ought to cool you off.

01:53:12.151 --> 01:53:14.487
Wait. Wait.

01:53:14.653 --> 01:53:16.622
How can I ever thank you?

01:53:17.156 --> 01:53:20.560
Oh, no. No,
you don't need to thank me.

01:53:21.059 --> 01:53:23.495
But I hope
you accept my apology.

01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:26.532
I'm sorry to the both of you.

01:53:27.265 --> 01:53:28.701
Especially you.

01:53:28.834 --> 01:53:32.171
You deserve so much.

01:53:33.371 --> 01:53:35.273
We all make mistakes.

01:53:38.958 --> 01:53:39.760
Aladdin?

01:53:43.215 --> 01:53:45.318
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:53:51.156 --> 01:53:53.526
Ooh, that's a bit
of a mess there, Abu.

01:53:53.658 --> 01:53:55.161
Let me take care
of that for you.

01:54:02.733 --> 01:54:04.202
Beautiful.

01:54:04.303 --> 01:54:05.404
Uh-uh-uh.

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.806
No, no long faces, all right?

01:54:08.139 --> 01:54:10.108
I got an idea.
All right?

01:54:10.209 --> 01:54:11.644
This is your last wish.

01:54:11.777 --> 01:54:14.413
Royalty was
the right idea, okay?

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.181
We should just
riff on that a little bit.

01:54:16.314 --> 01:54:17.750
All right,
here's what I'm thinking.

01:54:19.184 --> 01:54:21.754
Aladdin, warrior prince,

01:54:21.854 --> 01:54:25.625
a noble heart in a land
where thieves run feral!

01:54:26.425 --> 01:54:29.696
Jasmine!

01:54:29.795 --> 01:54:30.797
You like it?

01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:34.367
No? Okay, all right.
I hear you loud and clear.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.202
All right.
But this is what you need.

01:54:36.335 --> 01:54:39.404
The governing laws of Agrabah
by royal decree.

01:54:39.537 --> 01:54:41.607
Okay? And here it is.

01:54:41.739 --> 01:54:43.643
"Must marry a prince."

01:54:43.774 --> 01:54:45.812
Right.
But you say the words...

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:49.182
and this law just,
kinda like, goes away.

01:54:49.313 --> 01:54:52.551
And you and the princess
are in it together forever.

01:54:52.652 --> 01:54:54.720
You can just make
the law disappear?

01:54:54.819 --> 01:54:57.590
Pfft! Please.
Like it never existed.

01:54:58.924 --> 01:55:00.859
All right.
Last wish, let's get it.

01:55:01.193 --> 01:55:03.863
Okay. Last wish.

01:55:05.496 --> 01:55:06.498
Genie?

01:55:06.631 --> 01:55:08.166
I'm ready, hold on.
Here we go.

01:55:10.568 --> 01:55:11.736
I wish...

01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:13.773
Third and final wish.

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:15.640
I wish

01:55:16.474 --> 01:55:17.576
to set you free.

01:55:18.911 --> 01:55:20.145
What?

01:55:25.416 --> 01:55:27.452
Whoa. What? Oh!

01:55:30.788 --> 01:55:32.591
Wait.

01:55:40.866 --> 01:55:42.234
Wait, am I...?

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:50.876
Wait, wait, wait.

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:52.211
Um...

01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:53.446
Tell me to do something.

01:55:53.545 --> 01:55:55.580
Um... Get me some jams.

01:55:57.648 --> 01:55:59.151
Get it yourself?

01:56:01.286 --> 01:56:03.256
Get your own jams!

01:56:09.694 --> 01:56:12.465
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:15.201
No. Thank you, Genie.

01:56:15.767 --> 01:56:17.435
I owe you everything.

01:56:20.839 --> 01:56:22.207
What are you gonna do now?

01:56:24.376 --> 01:56:25.545
Um...

01:56:27.712 --> 01:56:31.317
Actually,
there is this handmaiden...

01:56:32.951 --> 01:56:36.255
that I would love
to travel the world with.

01:56:38.357 --> 01:56:39.559
If she'll have me.

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.930
When do we leave?
Also, I want children.

01:56:45.264 --> 01:56:46.599
Yes. Two of them.

01:56:47.265 --> 01:56:49.268
<i>Lian and Omar,
three years apart.</i>

01:56:49.367 --> 01:56:51.803
<i>They will worship us both
and ask lots of questions...</i>

01:56:51.937 --> 01:56:54.407
<i>and you will entertain them
with stories and songs.</i>

01:56:54.538 --> 01:56:55.741
...and he's handsome like me.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.875
<i>We'll have a boat.</i>

01:56:56.974 --> 01:56:58.877
<i>A large one
with multiple levels</i>

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:00.479
<i>and magnificent sails.</i>

01:57:00.578 --> 01:57:01.980
I was thinking
more of a smaller one.

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.248
Perfect.

01:57:03.381 --> 01:57:04.849
Perfect.

01:57:05.584 --> 01:57:07.553
Sit with me, my child.

01:57:08.787 --> 01:57:09.889
I'm sorry.

01:57:09.988 --> 01:57:12.724
- Baba, why are you...?
- Please, let me finish.

01:57:13.524 --> 01:57:17.996
I feared losing you.
Like I lost your mother.

01:57:18.596 --> 01:57:23.702
All I saw was my little girl,
not the woman you have become.

01:57:23.934 --> 01:57:28.673
You have shown me
courage and strength.

01:57:28.806 --> 01:57:33.612
You are the future of Agrabah.

01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:44.390
You shall be the next sultan.

01:57:53.732 --> 01:57:55.368
Thank you, Baba.

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.903
And as sultan,
you may change the law.

01:58:00.404 --> 01:58:01.907
He is a good man.

01:58:08.947 --> 01:58:10.382
Where'd he go?

01:58:38.577 --> 01:58:41.614
Stop, thief.
Your sultan commands it.

01:58:46.117 --> 01:58:47.486
Sultan?

01:58:49.153 --> 01:58:51.424
Does that mean I'm in trouble?

01:58:54.593 --> 01:58:56.696
Only because you got caught.
