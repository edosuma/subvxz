WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.773
Boom.
When ya have it, boys.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.441
Man,
he beat every one of us.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.743
Actually, not everyone.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.479
Oh, yeah? What's --
What's -- What's that
supposed to mean?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.048
You haven't played me.

00:14.082 --> 00:17.551
Ah, oh, it wouldn't be fair.
I'm from the homeland.

00:17.585 --> 00:22.190
Competitive darts
is, uh, oozing out of my pores.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.357
Really? Um...

00:23.391 --> 00:25.726
there's not a sport on
this planet you can beat me at.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.561
All right?
And I'll tell you what.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.330
How about 20 bucks,
right now,

00:29.363 --> 00:31.732
we play high score,
three darts?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.767
Come on.
Mr. Gable,

00:33.801 --> 00:35.603
you can have
your three darts.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.106
I only need one.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.573
Whoa!

00:39.607 --> 00:42.076
It just got real.
Dude,
he just called you out.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.812
Ah, now, now,
now, gentlemen,

00:44.845 --> 00:46.080
it's just
a friendly challenge.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.182
I'll go first.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.820
Side-arm.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.591
-Whoa!
-Oh-ho!

00:57.625 --> 01:00.794
Oh!

01:00.828 --> 01:05.766
I believe that's what you fellas
would call a "microphone drop."

01:05.799 --> 01:07.835
All right, all right,
fine, whatever.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.470
You got a bull's-eye,
all right?

01:09.503 --> 01:12.106
50 points. I can beat that easy.
I get three darts.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.641
Oh,
I anxiously await that.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.775
-Come on, guy. Come on.
-Do it, Kev.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.111
Come on.
I got this, man.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.416
All right, 'cause you idiots
are in my peripheral vision.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.251
You got to step back.
All right.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.418
Does that even count,
by the way?

01:24.452 --> 01:26.120
It shouldn't even count.
-We moved. Good luck. Come on.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.289
All right.
You just need a, what?

01:28.322 --> 01:29.657
A triple 20
and you win.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.824
All right, stop, okay?
Here we go.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.526
There we go. Ugh.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.162
Kid got in his head.
Yep.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.664
Well, t-that's 3. You just need
47 more with one dart.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.332
I-I know what I got to do,
okay?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.733
-All right, come on. Come on.
-I'm doing it!

01:39.767 --> 01:41.835
Come on, try it side-arm.
I'm doin' it side-arm!
American-style!

01:44.738 --> 01:49.610
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:49.643 --> 01:53.414
Dingdong.
Wendy's here.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.616
Hey, how you doin'?

01:55.649 --> 01:56.884
Good.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.153
Always good when I'm cooking.
How are you?

01:59.187 --> 02:01.689
Always good when I'm eating.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.593
Means that we're both good.
What

02:05.626 --> 02:07.761
Well,
I'll give you a hint.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.265
It rhymes with...

02:11.299 --> 02:12.633
enchiladas.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.402
It's enchiladas.
I'm really bad at that.
Okay.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.769
Yeah, no,
that's all right. No prob--

02:15.803 --> 02:17.871
Hey, if they're as good
as the ones I had two weeks ago,

02:17.905 --> 02:19.907
I am gonna be
very, very happy.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.209
They're better.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.878
Last time
I used a ground chuck.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.547
This time...

02:26.580 --> 02:29.217
Kobe beef.
Wow.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.652
I am gonna start calling
you State Farm,

02:31.685 --> 02:33.254
'cause you are
a good neighbor.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.458
Let me get in here
and try this.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.328
All right. Ooh.
It's still warm.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.662
So good.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.401
Mmm.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.939
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.

02:51.972 --> 02:55.276
That's literally the best thing
I've ever had!

02:55.309 --> 02:57.811
Great.
Well, you keep enjoying it.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.979
Oh!

02:59.012 --> 03:00.648
Question.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.217
What are we?

03:03.251 --> 03:04.552
Oh, I know this one.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.488
I just saw this on
the, uh, Discovery Channel.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.591
We are like,
it's like 98% water.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.593
Right?
I mean, it seems crazy.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.262
Doesn't -- Doesn't seem
to make sense, right?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.863
'Cause we-- we'd be like
all over the place

03:15.896 --> 03:16.864
and feel like,
"Hey "

03:16.897 --> 03:21.001
No, I mean what are we?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.837
Oh.
Right.

03:23.871 --> 03:27.241
Well, we're neighbors.
We're...
Mm-hmm.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.108
...friends.
Yeah.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.810
W-Wendy, we had this talk.

03:29.843 --> 03:34.248
I mean, you love making the food
and I-I love eating it.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.749
I-I-I don't know.
Um...

03:35.783 --> 03:36.750
We're happy.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.752
I was happy,

03:38.786 --> 03:40.521
but now I want more.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.856
You want the whole enchilada?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.558
I'm serious.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.693
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.698
We're always saying we're gonna
do stuff, like see a movie.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.267
But you always seem
to have plans.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.269
That is not true.
Come on.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.271
Okay, fine. Then let's
see a movie Friday night.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.772
This Friday,
I do have plans.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.441
Ugh.
I -- N-No, seriously.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.410
It's a, uh --
It's a work thing.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.846
Uh, we have a dinner
for a small company awards.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.281
You know,
it's a local thing.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.883
Okay.
Then I can't do this.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.685
You mean, you, uh --
you can't do this?

04:11.719 --> 04:12.953
I mean everything.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.356
If you can't make time
for me,

04:15.389 --> 04:17.991
then I can't make time
for your food.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.262
I-I can make the time.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.066
Great. When?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.937
Uh...
I'm pretty busy now,

04:29.970 --> 04:32.473
but April --
my April opens right up.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.007
Today.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.377
A matinee movie,
you and me.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.047
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Okay.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.582
Yay!

04:41.615 --> 04:42.983
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.952
I'm gonna go
get changed right now.
Okay.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.920
This is gonna be
so much fun!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.622
Hey, Kendra!

04:53.494 --> 04:56.096
Did you just, uh,
make a date with Wendy?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.431
Yeah.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.633
Come on, Dad.
You are unbelievable.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.868
We've been through this.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.504
Can't you see she's
controlling you with food?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.673
Oh.
Listen, I get it.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.775
You -- You don't want me
to date.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.844
What? No. No, no, no, no.
I want you to date.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.013
Just not her.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.882
Look, it's just a movie,
all right?

05:14.915 --> 05:15.849
It's not a big deal.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.085
And, by the way, have --
have you tried this?

05:18.118 --> 05:18.952
Give that a shot.

05:18.986 --> 05:23.357
You will understand
what I'm saying.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.058
Holy crap.
Yep.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.627
That is literally
the best thing I've ever had.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.362
I literally --
I just said that.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.063
I just, literally,
just said that.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.066
Dude, what are you
still doing here?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.368
Go get
your movie pants on.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.403
All right, I'm going.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.939
**

05:38.972 --> 05:41.475
How great is this?

05:41.509 --> 05:42.776
Yeah, it's good.
It's good.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.612
Mm.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.147
Now, who's -- who's the lady
in the sunglasses?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.015
You know, it's --
I don't know.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.683
Really, it's kind of
hard to concentrate.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.718
My neck's sweating.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.486
Because it looks like
the girl from the beginning,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.854
but that girl
wasn't wearing sunglasses.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.055
I'm con...
Shh.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.123
...fused.
Well, why don't we just...

05:56.156 --> 05:58.659
watch it and just see
how things shake out, okay?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.961
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do that.
Okay.

06:02.563 --> 06:06.934
I never noticed it before,
but your ears are adorable.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.069
They look like
a cute little question mark.
Shh.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.405
They just need a dot
on the bottom. Boop.
Okay.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.106
Okay.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.543
Okay. Okay.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.711
Ooh. Ooh, I think
we're about to find out the --

06:17.745 --> 06:19.112
who the killer
might be here.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.081
Don't worry.
It's not him.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.417
It's the brother.
I read it online.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.089
**

06:29.122 --> 06:30.658
You went to the movies
with her?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.092
Yes, it was a mess.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.794
First of all, she wouldn't
shut up the whole time,

06:33.827 --> 06:37.197
she was very clingy, and she had
bad grandma perfume on.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.999
Oh, no.
It was the worst date ever.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.168
But this is incredible.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.903
Oh, my God. Kevin.
Rootger: Hey, guys.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.072
Just a heads up,
I got us some more toilet paper.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.206
So, uh,
we're good to go.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.076
W We got
like 500 rolls back there.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.111
I'm sorry.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.146
I grew up very poor,
and oftentimes,

06:53.180 --> 06:54.982
we couldn't afford
toilet paper.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.817
So I guess
it's the child in me

06:56.850 --> 07:00.020
feeling secure
knowing we have it.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.123
Oh, Rootger,
that's heartbreaking.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.726
Thank you
for understanding.
Of course.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.596
Actually,
that's a complete lie.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.230
I love Amazon Prime.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.833
I mean, you click a button,
it's there in an hour.

07:12.866 --> 07:13.901
I -- I can't stop.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.503
Send it back, okay?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.771
If I only knew how.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.940
All right,
so, back to Wendy.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.709
You are gonna
march over there

07:21.742 --> 07:23.911
and you are gonna
end this thing today.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.913
I don't think
I can do that.
And why is that?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.881
Okay, do me a favor.
Try that.
Okay.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.683
Try it.
It's -- Forget it. Okay.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.122
Oh, my...

07:35.155 --> 07:36.223
We have a problem.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.191
Yep.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.061
Right? I'm stuck.
No, you are not stuck.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.229
No. No.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.065
Yesterday,
it was a movie.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.234
Tomorrow, it's gonna be, "How
did she get you down the aisle?"

07:47.267 --> 07:49.102
We are ending this today.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.505
A true nightmare that would be,
right?

07:51.539 --> 07:53.140
Though, can you imagine the food
at the reception?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.676
It would be ridiculous!
Okay.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.244
It'd be the best food ever.
No, stop. Stop.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.411
We're focusing. We're gonna
end this right now.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.714
Actually, we're gonna do it
right now. Let's go. Let's go.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.982
Oh, come on.
Nope. Let's go.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.684
Will you --
Grab the enchiladas,
though.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.285
Grab 'em. Yep.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.154
**

08:07.187 --> 08:09.189
Wendy: Well,
this is a nice surprise.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.692
I didn't think I was gonna be
getting a visitor today.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.162
Yeah, um, Wendy, I just
think we probably need to talk.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.197
Yeah, okay.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.966
You want me to whip something up
for lunch?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.001
Uh, no.
I'm not here for that.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.004
Why?
W

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
Okay.
I was just gonna start making

08:25.739 --> 08:28.241
those, uh,
Swedish meatballs you wanted.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.210
The ones we've been talking
about for the last month?

08:30.243 --> 08:33.113
Yeah, all the spices
just arrived from Sweden,

08:33.146 --> 08:34.815
so those are in the works.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.751
In the meantime, I do have
some buttery-toasted

08:37.785 --> 08:41.555
black forest ham and cheese
sliders.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.624
Go get 'em.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.731
Hey.
Hey.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.266
Good to go?
Oh, yeah.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.736
Ah.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.072
I gotta tell you,
I'm really proud of you.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.576
You took care of business.
TCB.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.777
You know
what I'm talkin' about?

09:03.811 --> 09:05.312
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.115
But, um...

09:08.148 --> 09:09.683
what took you so long?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.221
You ate?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.291
She made me ham and cheese
sliders, okay?
Oh, my God.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.894
I was gonna save you one,
but...

09:20.928 --> 09:23.597
I ate it
on the way to the car.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.932
Did you even break up
with her?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.366
No.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.603
In fact, I invited her
to the banquet on Friday.

09:29.637 --> 09:32.039
You disgust me.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.241
I'm so weak.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.549
I mean,
I-I can't believe you!

09:42.582 --> 09:44.852
You go in there to break up with
Wendy, and what do you do?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.253
You get into
even deeper trouble.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.889
You want something
done right...

09:48.922 --> 09:50.724
you gotta do it
yourself.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.125
Hold on!

09:57.965 --> 09:59.032
How'd it go?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.734
It's done.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.671
You didn't hurt her,
did you?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.939
No, I didn't hurt her.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.908
I just explained to her

10:07.941 --> 10:10.410
that I've known you
for 23 years,

10:10.443 --> 10:12.680
and you are
incapable of change.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.915
And no matter
what she cooks,

10:14.948 --> 10:18.085
she is never gonna get you
to commit to her.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.154
She got it.
We're good.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.290
Could you pull over?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.426
No. No, I can't.
We are not going back.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.962
No, I think
I gotta throw up.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.799
**

10:31.832 --> 10:33.400
Oh, and by the way,

10:33.433 --> 10:35.435
the Islanders are playing
the Rangers on Saturday.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.870
Should we get
some tickets?

10:36.904 --> 10:37.938
I'm in.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.708
Uh, no can do for me.
I'm, uh -- I'm busy all day.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.843
I got to go in
for a sleep study.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.245
What?
Yeah, I got to spend the night
in a clinic

10:45.278 --> 10:47.314
so they can find out
if I have sleep apnea.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.716
You don't want to mess
with that.

10:48.749 --> 10:52.185
That's a match
you do not touch.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.787
Hey, guy,
you up for the Islanders?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.223
Kev?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.726
Wendy used to make,
um...

10:58.759 --> 11:01.028
She made the taco meat,
a pile of it,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.163
with -- with the chopped onions
and the -- and the --

11:03.196 --> 11:05.332
and the peppers
and -- and garlic.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.368
Wait, wait. Wouldn't that be
all loose and falling apart?

11:08.401 --> 11:10.704
You'd think so.
But here's the kicker.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.473
She wraps it in bacon,
like a safety harness.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.408
Ooh.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.344
You really gotta stop.
I can't.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.545
I thought you were getting
through this.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.749
I was, all right? For the first
few days, I had leftovers.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.985
I was able to...
wean myself off.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.487
Like a nicotine patch
with meat.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.491
Very good, Mott, yes.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.094
Ohh. I miss her.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.829
Am I nervous about it?
Yeah.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.497
I mean, they put those little
sticky things on your chest.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.631
That's never
for good reasons.

11:38.665 --> 11:42.302
Okay, you know, the thing is,
you don't miss Wendy,

11:42.335 --> 11:43.336
you miss her food.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.473
Okay? Now I will cook for you.
How about that?

11:46.506 --> 11:48.809
-Yeah, that's right. I can cook.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.778
I will make you the best
Swedish meatballs you ever had.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.879
I'll come over tonight
and do it.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.313
I mean, and you -- you don't
make 'em too big, right?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.282
I don't make them too big.
Because you gotta
make 'em the right size.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.450
I know what the --
I don't need your notes.
Okay.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.519
Y-You would do that
for me?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.021
I would do that for you.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.023
Once again, folks,
sleep apnea.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.025
I teeter between
life and death.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.829
But let's keep talking about
meatballs.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.964
What's the sauce like?

12:10.998 --> 12:14.134
**

12:14.167 --> 12:15.402
You know what?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.771
Actually smells really good
in here.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.907
You see?
I told you.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.274
Oh, and, by the way,

12:21.308 --> 12:24.077
I found a bunch
of my grandmother's recipes,

12:24.111 --> 12:25.813
all these great things
that I can make for you

12:25.846 --> 12:27.881
to help you
kick the Wendy habit.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.783
I like it.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.920
Oh, ziti?
Linguini with white clam sauce?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.521
Well, this --
this all looks amazing.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
I know. And you know what else
is amazing?

12:36.556 --> 12:38.258
My Swedish meatballs.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.793
Ooh.
Try one.

12:39.827 --> 12:43.530
Hey, thank you for taking
the time to do this.
I really do appreciate it.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.498
You're welcome, honey.
I love to see you happy.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.500
Okay.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
It tastes like a cat peed
on an old cheeseburger.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.471
Oh, stop.
It does not.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.940
Stop!

13:00.580 --> 13:03.083
* Watch the food go round
and round *

13:03.116 --> 13:05.318
* Waiting for this thing
to beep *

13:07.921 --> 13:08.822
What are you doing?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.291
Oh, hi. I was singing
the microwave song.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.093
Didn't realize
anyone was here.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.462
That food.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.264
That Wendy's?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.833
I don't know.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.570
Don't lie to me.
I recognize the dish.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.138
I put the chip in that handle,
right there.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.141
Fine. It's Wendy's.
She's been cooking for me.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.111
So, what's the big woof?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.214
The "big woof" is,
she was cooking for me first.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.248
And, by the way,
don't you have a girlfriend?

13:35.282 --> 13:37.084
What about Floor?
How's she feel about all that?

13:37.117 --> 13:39.252
Well, when it comes to food,
we have an open relationship.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.322
Actually, right now, she's
having sushi with a Frenchman.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.958
Pbht. I don't care.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.293
Don't you
just have it all?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.627
I guess I have.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.330
I'm #blessed.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.366
You
I'm -- I'm sorry.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.069
It's all good.
You just enjoy it.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.971
Do me a favor,
though, please.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.639
Treat her well, okay?
She's good people.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.074
I will, thanks.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.309
Oh, and, by the way,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.912
I don't want you to find
this out on the street.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.380
I'm meeting her
at the banquet dinner.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
She's my plus one.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.451
Oh. Happy for you.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.154
Well, you'll be there.
No, I won't be, okay?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.422
I'm not going.
It's too painful.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.157
But you were my ride,

14:17.190 --> 14:19.026
so now I'm gonna have to
figure something else out?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.027
Yeah.
Go with Wendy.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.262
I already told you,
she's meeting me there.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.196
Well, then, call Vanessa.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.098
She can't.
She's getting her nails done.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.599
Get an Uber!
I don't have the app.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.268
Download it!
I don't know how to.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.137
Figure it out!

14:30.170 --> 14:33.106
**

14:33.140 --> 14:34.541
Hey, bud.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.976
Hey.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.277
Hey, uh, listen,

14:37.310 --> 14:40.280
your dad went through a lot
the last couple days.

14:40.313 --> 14:43.016
Just got some crazy stuff
going on.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.185
And nothin' to be worried about.
I'm gonna be fine.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.455
Um, I was thinking
maybe tonight, uh, I don't know,

14:48.488 --> 14:52.425
you'd like to sit on the couch
and watch a little TV with me?

14:54.194 --> 14:55.328
No, I'm good.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.468
Hey.
How you holding up?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.403
Okay, I guess.
I just...

15:05.438 --> 15:07.674
Well, I was thinking about it,
Dad, and you know what?

15:07.707 --> 15:10.277
I'm -- I'm really glad that
you're not going to the banquet.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.479
Really?
Yeah. I mean,
you don't need that.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.014
First,
she was cooking for you,

15:14.047 --> 15:15.315
and then she was cooking
for Rootger?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.317
I mean,
that's just weird.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.186
She doesn't deserve you.

15:19.219 --> 15:22.455
Look, I know it's tough,
but you gotta stay strong, okay?

15:22.489 --> 15:26.293
Let's just kick back, watch
a movie, and have a great night.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.296
Love that.
Yeah, we're not even
gonna think about Wendy.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.298
About who?
Exactly.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.736
Mm. You know how I know
you made the right decision?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.438
These Swedish meatballs
Wendy made?

15:38.471 --> 15:39.973
Swing and a miss.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.708
No, those are Vanessa's.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.144
I heard Wendy's
were off the charts.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.246
Run to her.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.450
I'm comin', baby!

15:50.483 --> 15:53.120
**

15:53.153 --> 15:54.687
We get
one night out a month,

15:54.721 --> 15:56.289
and we gotta go
to a work thing?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.191
Look around.
It's fancy.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.161
It's ballroom
at a Massapequa motor lodge.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.365
Still,
very tastefully done.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.567
Hey, man, the only reason
I didn't bring Didi

16:07.600 --> 16:09.702
is 'cause we said
we weren't bringing wives.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.472
I appreciate that, dawg.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.541
And look at these stale
supermarket rolls.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.776
Oh, don't worry.
I brought my own.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.679
Of course, she did.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.214
These are amazing.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.549
Rustic sourdough.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.551
-Thank you!
-Mm-hmm.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.219
Who are you?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.021
Oh, I'm Wendy.
Heads up.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.527
She's the reason
why Kevin's not here.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.364
She's the Yoko
of Monkey Fist.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.666
Ahh.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.234
Kevin:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.469
What?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.105
Wendy.
What are you doing here?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.074
I just need to talk to you
for a second, okay?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.675
Now hear me out, please.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.577
It's too late.
It's never too late.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.113
Kevin, I am literally
begging you to stop.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.282
No, I gotta --
I gotta do this.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.150
Now you answer me this.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.286
Can he do what I do?

17:00.787 --> 17:03.223
Does Rootger eat your food
the way that I eat it?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.392
It's...different.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.493
Let me ask you this.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.495
When he returns
a-a casserole pan,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.431
is it empty, or is there
a little food left in it?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.800
Maybe a little,
I don't know.
Well, I do.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.103
I got 50 pounds on him!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.371
He, or nobody else --
you, either --

17:18.405 --> 17:20.340
will eat the way I eat!

17:22.375 --> 17:25.278
Now, you look me
in the eye...

17:25.312 --> 17:28.348
If you tell me you're happy,
I promise you, I'll --

17:28.381 --> 17:31.651
I'll walk out that door
and you'll never see me again.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.589
I'm happy.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.294
Okay.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.496
There it is.
Sorry.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.798
I'm happy
cooking for you.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.436
Swedish meatballs?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.671
Swedish meatballs.
Let's go!

17:51.704 --> 17:53.206
And then after,
we can see a movie?

17:53.240 --> 17:54.474
Not even close!
Okay!

17:58.178 --> 18:01.248
Man.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.151
This is literally the best roll
I ever had in my life.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.493
I'm glad we put the Wendy
thing behind us.
Yeah.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.762
And we both agree
not to eat her food, right?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.165
Hear, hear.
All right.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.333
See, now, this is what
I'm talking about.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.136
Two guys seeing a movie,
no one bugging us.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.372
Mm.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.340
Oh, here we go.
All right.

18:27.374 --> 18:34.847
**

18:34.881 --> 18:36.216
Now, who's the guy
with the beard?

18:36.249 --> 18:38.518
He was in something else.
Shh.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.919
Shh.
Keep it down, man.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.588
I don't know.
We'll find out.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.226
Ooh!
I had a car like that,

18:46.259 --> 18:48.261
but it had bigger rims
than that one.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.862
Okay, Rootger.
Really nice light blue.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.732
Rootger,

18:52.765 --> 18:54.734
We got to watch.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.543
I never noticed this before,
but, uh,

19:03.576 --> 19:06.579
your ear
looks like a question mark.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.548
You know, it's like...
What?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.550
All it needs
is a little bit of a...
Shh!

19:10.583 --> 19:13.553
Y-You touch me, I swear, I will
try to beat the crap out of you.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.925
* Don't want no sweet perfume

19:18.958 --> 19:22.662
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

19:22.695 --> 19:24.864
* Do, do, do, do, do

19:24.897 --> 19:26.399
* Do, do, do, do

19:26.433 --> 19:30.203
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

19:30.237 --> 19:32.872
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

19:32.905 --> 19:34.907
* I just don't want no...
