(EXCLAIMING)

09:20.562 --> 09:22.713
Phineas and Ferb,
you are so busted...

09:22.714 --> 09:24.865
Oh, my gosh! Where'd it
go?
You there, small children!

09:24.867 --> 09:27.134
Where's the big
contraption?

09:27.135 --> 09:29.402
I don't know.
It was here
just a moment ago.

09:29.404 --> 09:31.338
It disappeared?

09:31.340 --> 09:32.706
Stacy, do you realize
what this means?
We're done?

09:32.708 --> 09:35.375
No, some kind of
mysterious force

09:35.377 --> 09:38.645
always takes away
Phineas and Ferb's
inventions
before Mom shows up.

09:38.647 --> 09:41.681
This time it took
away their invention
before I showed up!

09:41.683 --> 09:43.817
The mysterious force
recognizes that
I'm now a grown-up.

09:43.819 --> 09:47.320
A mysterious force?
I'm not buying it.

09:47.322 --> 09:49.956
I am a woman of science,
at least that's what
my horoscope said.

09:49.958 --> 09:51.725
Well, I'm going to
prove it to you

09:51.727 --> 09:54.327
and bust my brothers
at the same time!

09:54.329 --> 09:55.562
Where are my brothers?

09:55.564 --> 09:56.897
We just launched them
towards the park.

09:56.899 --> 09:58.565
Buford is there with
the other platypult.

09:58.567 --> 10:01.401
Okay, as the adult,
I decree we are
going to the park.

10:01.403 --> 10:02.736
Does anyone need
to go potty first?

10:05.674 --> 10:06.973
Fine, make it quick.

10:06.975 --> 10:09.943
Ferb, it looks like
we're gonna hit
that building

10:09.945 --> 10:11.878
that looks vaguely
like your head.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.614
Time to give it
a little test.

10:15.984 --> 10:17.884
(MACHINE POWERING DOWN)

10:17.885 --> 10:19.785
Hmm.
Well, I just finished it.
It can't be broken
already.

10:23.058 --> 10:25.525
(SIGHS)
I stand corrected.

10:25.527 --> 10:27.460
All right, what's with
the giant shuttlecock?

10:27.462 --> 10:29.830
We're really sorry, sir.
I don't know what
happened.

10:29.832 --> 10:31.731
One minute,
we were innocently
launching ourselves

10:31.733 --> 10:34.668
across the city in
a badminton platypult.
The next thing we know,

10:34.670 --> 10:36.336
we're bouncing on
up to the eastside

10:36.338 --> 10:37.938
to your deluxe apartment
in the sky.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.807
Well, it looks like
you've totaled my
Other-Dimensionator.

10:40.809 --> 10:43.677
An Other-Dimensionator?
What does it do?

10:43.679 --> 10:46.980
Well, at the moment,
it just stops giant
shuttlecocks, apparently.

10:46.982 --> 10:49.883
But it's supposed
to let me go into
other dimensions.

10:49.885 --> 10:51.551
That's cool!
We can help you fix it.

10:51.553 --> 10:54.654
I'm Phineas,
and this is my
brother Ferb.

10:54.656 --> 10:57.791
I'm Dr. Heinz
Doofenshmirtz,
but my friends call me...
(SIGHS)

11:00.696 --> 11:01.995
I just got in such a funk.

11:01.997 --> 11:04.898
Ferb is naturally
handy with tools.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.132
I bet we could
put this thing back
together in no time.

11:06.134 --> 11:08.902
What the heck.
Before we start,

11:08.904 --> 11:11.321
there's a whole
buffet set up here,
please partake.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.739
I was expecting someone
who seems to be running
late.

11:13.742 --> 11:14.708
You're lucky I got
a rocket car winch.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.877
Lots of guys
don't have that.

11:17.579 --> 11:20.580
PHINEAS: Almost there.

11:20.582 --> 11:23.783
Okay,
field compressor attaches
to the auxiliary
generator.

11:23.785 --> 11:26.019
Was this working before?

11:26.021 --> 11:28.922
Well, if by "working"
you mean "functioning
properly," then no.

11:28.924 --> 11:30.741
Well, I think
I see your problem.

11:30.742 --> 11:32.559
Everything's wired through
this self-destruct button.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.027
Do you even need that?

11:34.029 --> 11:36.396
Well, of course I...

11:36.398 --> 11:39.432
Wait a minute.
No, I do not need that.

11:39.434 --> 11:41.635
You are absolutely right.

11:41.637 --> 11:43.904
So Ferb has rigged up
this remote control

11:43.906 --> 11:45.639
so that if we get
separated from the portal,
we can open another one.

11:45.641 --> 11:46.806
Nice touch, kid.

11:46.808 --> 11:49.009
I guess this is
the last piece.

11:49.011 --> 11:50.710
Okay, Ferb,
boost me up.

11:54.149 --> 11:54.781
Ooh, I cannot wait!

11:58.520 --> 12:00.504
(CHATTERING)

12:00.505 --> 12:02.489
PHINEAS:
There you are, Perry.
Perry?

12:02.491 --> 12:04.891
Yeah. He's our
pet platypus.

12:04.893 --> 12:05.692
Is every platypus
named Perry?

12:05.694 --> 12:08.561
In a perfect world, yes.

12:08.563 --> 12:09.963
Well, he's a cute
little fellow.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.665
Hi, there.
Coochee, coochee...
Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:11.667 --> 12:13.934
Perry, no!
We do not bite
the elderly.

12:13.936 --> 12:16.036
Again, ow!
It's okay.

12:16.038 --> 12:17.804
Platypuses don't
typically like me.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.571
Well, Perry, you're just
in time to see us open
a window

12:19.574 --> 12:22.542
into another dimension.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.210
Perry, no!
What are you doing?

12:24.212 --> 12:25.946
No, no!

12:25.948 --> 12:28.581
Perry, this is not
tug of war!

12:28.583 --> 12:30.483
This is not
tug of war!

12:30.485 --> 12:32.686
Silly boy,
what's gotten into him?

12:32.688 --> 12:33.887
All right,
let's get this show
on the road, huh?

12:33.889 --> 12:36.656
<i> Remember,</i>
<i> if your cover is blown,</i>

12:36.658 --> 12:39.025
<i> you'll never see</i>
<i> the boys again.</i>

12:39.027 --> 12:40.593
Hey, does anyone hear
someone talking?

12:40.595 --> 12:42.796
<i> Never see them again.</i>

12:42.798 --> 12:46.900
Okay, here we go.
Right in...

12:49.137 --> 12:51.104
Perry! No!
Not on the sofa!

12:51.106 --> 12:54.741
I'm sorry, Dr. D.
We should take him out.

12:54.743 --> 12:56.760
No, no. Wait.
It'll be all right.

12:56.761 --> 12:58.778
I was planning on
replacing this
old couch anyway.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.680
Now come on.
Let's light
this pop stand,

13:00.682 --> 13:00.880
or however it goes.

13:05.887 --> 13:07.754
Gosh, this is...
It's kind of
weird, actually.

13:07.756 --> 13:10.123
I'm usually thwarted
by this point.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.025
Well, I guess
he's not coming.

13:12.027 --> 13:15.195
And now, behold!

13:15.197 --> 13:19.899
The mind-blowing
first images from beyond
our dimensional reality!

13:27.876 --> 13:29.142
Hmm.

13:29.144 --> 13:32.078
It's a...
It's a couch.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.080
That's a bit
anticlimactic.

13:34.082 --> 13:37.984
I guess it's a nice couch,
though...

13:37.986 --> 13:41.121
Hey! I got an idea!
Let's swap my couch
for that one!

13:42.524 --> 13:44.374
Um...

13:44.375 --> 13:46.225
I got it. I got...
Or maybe I...

13:46.228 --> 13:48.228
Come on, you want to
give me a hand here?

13:48.230 --> 13:49.596
Whoa! Awesome,
check it out.

13:49.598 --> 13:50.764
(MAN CLEARS THROAT)

13:53.101 --> 13:53.833
(STUTTERS) Hello.

13:56.038 --> 13:57.637
Say, aren't you...

13:57.639 --> 13:58.905
PHINEAS: Hey, Dr. D!
Look at this.

13:58.907 --> 14:00.273
Hold that thought.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.640
You're famous here.

14:12.687 --> 14:14.120
DOOFENSHMIRTZ'S VOICE:
<i> Get off!</i>

14:16.291 --> 14:19.692
(IN DISBELIEF)
"Heinz Doofenshmirtz,
your leader"?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.934
A whole tri-state area
where I am already in
charge!

14:27.936 --> 14:30.770
Yeah! Hold on,
I gotta go check
something out.

14:30.772 --> 14:33.773
Uh, yoo-hoo!
Hello, again.

14:33.775 --> 14:36.643
Is this some kind of test?
Is that really you, sir?

14:36.645 --> 14:38.244
(LAUGHS) Holy boy!

14:38.246 --> 14:42.682
Even the great
Francis Monogram's
my slave in this
dimension!

14:42.684 --> 14:44.217
I prefer the term
"indentured
executive assistant."

14:44.219 --> 14:46.352
Well, I want to meet
this other dimension me.

14:46.354 --> 14:48.755
Where can I find him?

14:48.757 --> 14:50.323
Oh. You're from
another dimension?

14:50.325 --> 14:52.258
Well, he'll probably
wanna see you then.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.993
He's into that
freaky sort of stuff.

14:53.995 --> 14:56.996
Have a seat
and I'll let him know
you're on your way up.

14:56.998 --> 14:59.365
Okay. So I just
gotta sit here and...

15:02.003 --> 15:04.337
CHORUS:

All right, who's
interrupting my...

15:13.181 --> 15:14.681
Hmm.

15:16.351 --> 15:16.816
Hmm.

15:21.923 --> 15:23.089
Do I know you?

15:23.091 --> 15:25.391
Yeah! I'm you from
another dimension!

15:25.393 --> 15:28.194
Well, that would explain
the handsomeness.

15:28.196 --> 15:30.213
Right back at you,
big guy.

15:30.214 --> 15:32.231
Does that mean
you and I are
exactly alike?

No. It just sort of

I mean, we could.
We should!

17:28.316 --> 17:31.017
Hmm. Maybe we're
not so much alike.

17:31.019 --> 17:32.385
That can be
our catch phrase.

17:32.387 --> 17:34.354
You're the grumpy one.

17:37.158 --> 17:39.892
Wow, he's done
really well for himself.
What do you think, Perry?

17:45.133 --> 17:46.432
(CHATTERING)

17:46.434 --> 17:49.002
Hey, where is Dr. D?

17:49.004 --> 17:52.105
So what you're telling me
is you're still not ruler
of your tri-state area?

17:52.107 --> 17:54.240
Well, obviously you
did not have to deal

17:54.242 --> 17:55.375
with my nemesis,
Perry the Platypus.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.944
Oh, didn't I? Observe.

17:59.381 --> 18:00.513
What is it?

18:03.551 --> 18:06.919
DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
This is Perry the
Platyborg!

18:06.921 --> 18:11.257
He was once my nemesis,
but now, he's general
of my army!

18:11.259 --> 18:13.259
Wow! You are good!

18:13.261 --> 18:14.861
DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
Dismissed.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.897
That was awesome!

18:17.899 --> 18:19.716
Now who's
interrupting me?

18:19.717 --> 18:21.534
Remind me to berate
my indentured
executive assistant.

18:21.536 --> 18:22.869
No, man, it's cool.
They're with me.

18:22.871 --> 18:25.972
Hey, Dr. D.
We thought we'd lost you.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.206
Hi, fellas!

18:27.208 --> 18:29.876
You dare to bring
a secret agent in here?

18:29.878 --> 18:31.177
This boy's
a secret agent?

18:31.179 --> 18:33.379
No, not him!
The quiet one?

18:33.381 --> 18:34.914
DOOFENSHMIRTZ 2D:
No! Not... No. Him!

18:34.916 --> 18:37.283
This plant?

18:37.285 --> 18:40.887
The platypus!
That's Secret Agent
Perry the Platypus!

18:40.889 --> 18:43.156
Oh, hey.
He's just a platypus.
He doesn't do much.

18:43.158 --> 18:46.192
This is rich.
I see what's
going on here.

18:46.194 --> 18:49.362
You really think
that he's your pet,
don't you?

18:49.364 --> 18:51.097
Wrong! He's using you!

18:51.099 --> 18:52.598
You're just his cover.
He's a secret agent!

18:52.600 --> 18:55.034
Here, here,
let me prove it.

18:55.036 --> 18:57.603
General Platyborg,
come down here at once.

18:57.605 --> 19:00.606
He'll be here
in just a second.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

19:00.608 --> 19:02.608
All right, Platyborg,
you see that platypus?

19:02.610 --> 19:03.843
You know what to do.

19:04.212 --> 19:05.945
Perry!

19:08.850 --> 19:10.383
What was that for?
Perry, are you okay?

19:10.385 --> 19:12.618
Told you.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.620
How are his vitals?

19:14.622 --> 19:18.124
Wait, let me
try something.
Platyborg!

19:18.126 --> 19:19.625
Do the same thing
to those two boys.
What?

19:21.863 --> 19:22.628
What?

19:24.132 --> 19:26.999
CHORUS:
<i> ♪ Perry ♪</i>

19:27.869 --> 19:29.635
Perry?

19:29.637 --> 19:31.571
Yes! I knew it!

19:31.573 --> 19:33.172
Wait a minute.
I'm confused.

19:33.174 --> 19:33.940
Why does their platypus
fight so good?

19:37.045 --> 19:37.877
Perry the Platypus!

19:39.280 --> 19:40.646
Really?

19:40.648 --> 19:41.647
What?

19:42.350 --> 19:43.483
Perry?

19:43.485 --> 19:44.650
Get them!

19:48.123 --> 19:49.555
You're a secret agent?

19:50.558 --> 19:51.891
Whoa! Whoa!

19:54.195 --> 19:56.262
Hey, be careful with that.

19:56.264 --> 19:58.297
So this is where
you disappear to
every day?

19:58.299 --> 20:00.199
You come here
and fight this guy?

20:00.201 --> 20:03.369
No, he fights me.
He doesn't really
know this guy.

20:03.371 --> 20:05.171
You fight a pharmacist?
Why would you even do
that?

20:05.173 --> 20:07.640
Actually,
I'm an evil scientist.

20:07.642 --> 20:10.476
A lot of people
are confused by
the lab coat.

20:10.478 --> 20:12.111
You're evil?
He's evil?

20:12.280 --> 20:14.547
(GLASS CRACKING)

20:17.652 --> 20:20.353
So, not only have you
been leading a double
life this whole time,

20:20.355 --> 20:23.222
but you sat there
and let us help
an evil scientist

20:23.224 --> 20:24.690
open an evil portal
into an evil dimension!

20:24.692 --> 20:26.659
And you did nothing
to stop us?

20:26.661 --> 20:29.128
Well, he did pee
on the couch.

20:29.130 --> 20:30.963
Wait a second,
I just realized.

20:30.965 --> 20:34.100
That was a conscious
choice.
You peed on my couch!

20:34.102 --> 20:35.635
No, no.
That wasn't enough.

20:35.637 --> 20:37.503
That's when you should
have
put on your little hat.

20:37.505 --> 20:40.506
Not now, after we've
gone through it into
this mess!

20:40.508 --> 20:43.376
For badness sake,
you can hash all
this out in prison.

20:43.378 --> 20:45.144
Guards!

20:45.146 --> 20:46.579
Ow! Brain freeze!

20:47.515 --> 20:49.182
(YELLING)

20:55.290 --> 20:59.225
I'm sorry.
I'm just having trouble
processing this right now.

20:59.227 --> 21:01.327
"So you've discovered
your pet is a secret
agent."

21:01.329 --> 21:02.528
I don't want
your pamphlet!

21:04.699 --> 21:05.965
Uh-oh.

21:10.171 --> 21:13.005
He's coming
back around!

21:19.547 --> 21:21.047
(GRUNTING)

21:24.018 --> 21:26.052
You have got
to be kidding me.

21:27.355 --> 21:30.323
For crying out loud.

21:30.325 --> 21:31.991
What, they didn't teach
you
how to get out of this
in spy school?

21:40.201 --> 21:42.435
Oh, snap.

21:42.437 --> 21:43.503
Look! There's a logo
on this parachute!

21:43.505 --> 21:45.638
He's got his own logo?

22:06.060 --> 22:08.461
All this time we're like,
"He's a platypus.
He doesn't do much."

22:08.463 --> 22:11.764
Well, apparently you do!
You do... You're...

22:11.766 --> 22:13.633
You're tangled up in
the...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

22:25.780 --> 22:29.315
Wow! Saved by
unconventional
architecture.

22:29.317 --> 22:29.782
<i> May I please</i>
<i> see your papers?</i>

22:34.188 --> 22:36.188
<i> Show me your papers</i>
<i> or be destroyed.</i>

23:01.115 --> 23:04.317
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

23:04.319 --> 23:06.218
Jinx! You owe me a soda.

23:07.622 --> 23:09.689
<i> Get me! I'm a Georgia</i>
<i> O'Keeffe painting!</i>

23:11.726 --> 23:13.492
Fourth and Main.

23:16.798 --> 23:19.365
What? No tip?

23:19.367 --> 23:21.167
Never mind. I'm good.

23:29.314 --> 23:32.048
Looks like
they're gone.

23:32.451 --> 23:33.851
You're a secret agent?

23:33.853 --> 23:35.586
And you've been
living with us
this whole time?

23:35.588 --> 23:37.087
Was that evil guy right?

23:37.089 --> 23:38.923
Were we just
a cover story to you?

23:38.925 --> 23:41.325
I mean, were you ever
really our pet
or part of our family?

23:41.327 --> 23:44.395
Well, apparently not,
'cause you didn't trust us
enough to tell us.

23:44.397 --> 23:47.331
Anyone else
around here leading
a bizarre double life?

23:47.333 --> 23:50.067
Put your hand down, Ferb.

23:52.104 --> 23:54.738
You're a secret agent!
He's a secret agent!

23:56.943 --> 23:59.043
You're right, Ferb.
We've got to concentrate
on the task at hand.

23:59.045 --> 24:01.779
We've got to get back
to our dimension,

24:01.781 --> 24:03.514
and I don't even know
where to start!

24:03.516 --> 24:05.516
That's right!
The remote!

24:05.518 --> 24:06.784
I knew that would
come in handy.

24:06.786 --> 24:07.785
All right,
let's go home.

24:09.822 --> 24:11.922
Wait, that's not
our dimension.

24:12.959 --> 24:13.624
Nope. Uh-uh.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.564
Now this thing's broken.
We're gonna need some
help.

24:20.566 --> 24:22.900
I know!
Let's go find us!

24:26.138 --> 24:29.073
Wait, I just realized,

24:29.075 --> 24:32.776
you could have been
cleaning your own
litter box this whole
time!

24:32.778 --> 24:37.114
We are not done
with this conversation.

24:37.116 --> 24:40.417
So tell me,
other dimension me,
what do you see here?

24:40.419 --> 24:41.819
An ordinary platypus.

24:41.821 --> 24:43.520
And now
what do you see?

24:43.522 --> 24:45.122
Perry the Platypus!

24:45.124 --> 24:46.790
You know,
I'm starting to see

24:46.792 --> 24:49.159
why you haven't
become ruler
in your dimension.

24:49.161 --> 24:51.829
All right,
Mr. Eviler-Than-Thou,

24:51.830 --> 24:54.498
just how did you
manage to take over
the tri-state area anyway?

24:54.500 --> 24:58.035
Simple, I used
an army of big,
scary robots.

24:58.037 --> 25:00.471
NORMBOTS: <i> We should</i>
<i> do lunch sometime.</i>

25:00.473 --> 25:02.907
Wow, that is scary.

25:02.909 --> 25:04.808
I tried that
robot thing once, too.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.577
I hid the self-destruct
button
on the bottoms of their
feet

25:06.579 --> 25:08.545
<i> so no one</i>
<i> could reach them.</i>

25:12.184 --> 25:13.384
And march!

25:13.385 --> 25:14.585
I think I've said enough.
I still don't get it.

25:14.587 --> 25:17.922
If we're the same person,
why are you so much better
at being evil than me?

25:17.924 --> 25:21.959
True evil is born
through pain and loss.

25:21.961 --> 25:25.162
You see,
when I was a small boy
back in Gimelschtump,

25:25.164 --> 25:27.998
I had a toy train.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.566
<i> Then, one day I lost it.</i>

25:29.568 --> 25:30.834
Choo-Choo?

25:34.674 --> 25:37.141
That's... That's it?
What do you mean?

25:37.143 --> 25:39.043
That's your emotionally
scarring back-story?

25:39.045 --> 25:41.011
That's your
great tragedy?

25:41.013 --> 25:43.747
Dude! I was
raised by ocelots.
I mean, literally.

25:43.749 --> 25:46.116
Disowned by my parents
and raised by
Central American wildcats,

25:46.118 --> 25:48.485
and you're telling me
you lost a toy train?
That's all?

25:48.487 --> 25:50.688
That's all you got,
really?

25:50.690 --> 25:52.156
I had to work
as a lawn gnome!

25:52.158 --> 25:53.757
<i> I was forced to wear</i>
<i> hand-me-up girl's</i>
<i> clothing!</i>

25:53.759 --> 25:57.094
<i> Neither of my parents</i>
<i> showed up for my birth!</i>

25:57.096 --> 25:59.596
Well, how did you
feel when you lost
that toy train?

25:59.598 --> 26:01.231
I never lost
that toy train...

26:01.233 --> 26:03.634
Well, maybe if you had,
you'd have done better.

26:03.636 --> 26:06.904
Since you have neglected
to take over your
tri-state area,

26:06.906 --> 26:10.107
I think I'll go over there
and give it a shot myself!

26:10.109 --> 26:12.609
Great!
We can be a team!

26:12.611 --> 26:15.079
Yeah, right. A team.

26:15.081 --> 26:16.480
Wait, was that sarcasm?

26:16.482 --> 26:18.115
No!

26:18.116 --> 26:19.749
Yeah! Right there!
I'm pretty sure
that's my voice

26:19.752 --> 26:21.518
when I'm being sarcastic.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.086
Okay, Buford,
where are
Phineas and Ferb?

26:22.088 --> 26:24.221
How should I know?

26:24.223 --> 26:26.090
They never showed up
for me to return serve!

26:26.092 --> 26:28.792
That's considered a
forfeit
in catapult badminton.

26:28.794 --> 26:30.527
So I went to get
some Victory Gum.

26:30.529 --> 26:31.962
CHORUS:
<i> ♪ Victory Gum! ♪</i>

26:31.964 --> 26:34.531
A tradition as old
as the game itself.

26:34.533 --> 26:35.799
Don't play with me,
young man.

26:35.801 --> 26:37.835
Where is the giant
platypult they built?

26:37.837 --> 26:39.770
I don't know.
Seems to have vanished.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.872
Really? Did you
hear that, Stacy?

26:41.874 --> 26:43.941
The mysterious force
took the platypult away

26:43.943 --> 26:46.143
before I, the grown-up,
could see it.

26:46.145 --> 26:49.646
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure
there's a perfectly
logical
explanation for all of

26:49.648 --> 26:52.716
And they laughed at me
for installing
a platypult tow rig!

26:52.718 --> 26:54.151
Who's laughing now, Wayne?

26:54.153 --> 26:58.155
The logical explanation
is the mysterious force.

26:58.157 --> 26:59.923
The real question is,

26:59.925 --> 27:02.192
why does it care so much
about my little brothers?

27:02.194 --> 27:04.895
Why doesn't it want
them to get busted?

27:04.896 --> 27:07.597
Well, why don't you
ask it, Kierkegaard?

27:07.600 --> 27:09.967
What? Existentialist
trading cards.

27:09.969 --> 27:12.019
They came with the gum.

27:12.020 --> 27:14.070
Wait, he's right!
I should just ask it!

27:14.073 --> 27:16.173
I'll bet I can
reason with it.
Reason with it?

27:16.175 --> 27:19.676
Candace, it's a force
that you made up.

27:19.678 --> 27:21.745
No, I know what I'm
talking about, Stacy!

27:21.747 --> 27:23.180
Come on!
STACY: Where are you
going?

27:23.182 --> 27:27.151
To my back yard!
The heart of the
mysterious force!

27:27.153 --> 27:29.553
Would you like to
trade two Sartre
for a Nietzsche?

27:29.555 --> 27:30.921
All right.

27:30.923 --> 27:32.089
Sucker!

27:37.096 --> 27:39.696
Well, this should be
our street.

27:39.698 --> 27:40.731
But it sure
looks different.

27:45.671 --> 27:46.904
Dad?

27:46.906 --> 27:48.622
Boys, what are you
doing here?

27:48.623 --> 27:50.339
You'd better get inside
before the Doofbot
catches you.

27:50.342 --> 27:52.810
I'm off to the factory.
See you next week.

27:53.779 --> 27:56.346
Wow! Well, I guess
we'd better get inside.

27:59.251 --> 28:02.753
You might want to...

28:02.755 --> 28:05.656
I mean, these guys
might not know that
you're not really a...

28:05.658 --> 28:06.824
You know.

28:08.761 --> 28:10.127
(CHATTERING)

28:18.204 --> 28:21.805
Boys! I thought you
were in your room.
Get inside!

28:21.807 --> 28:24.007
And get your dooferalls
back on before someone
sees you.

28:24.009 --> 28:26.977
If you need me,
I'll be hiding
in the basement.

28:26.979 --> 28:28.645
That was weird.
Let's find
the other us's.

28:30.850 --> 28:33.851
And... Hey, I got a one!

28:33.853 --> 28:35.953
Pick a Doofopoly
instruction card!

28:35.955 --> 28:37.955
"Conform."
I can do that.

28:37.957 --> 28:39.389
Hi, guys.

28:39.391 --> 28:41.225
No! They're
replacing us!

28:41.227 --> 28:42.960
I must not have conformed
quick enough.

28:42.962 --> 28:44.194
No, no,
it's not like that.

28:44.196 --> 28:45.763
We're you guys
from another dimension.

28:45.764 --> 28:47.331
Different dimension?
Is that allowed?
Apparently.

28:47.333 --> 28:50.200
Oh, look!
Perry's back!

28:50.202 --> 28:53.303
Where have you been?
We've missed you so much.

28:53.305 --> 28:55.973
Phineas,
he's not your Perry.
He came with us.

28:55.975 --> 28:58.275
Oh. Sorry.

28:58.277 --> 29:00.944
Wait, can I hold him
a little longer?

29:05.151 --> 29:08.185
It's just that,
well, he left one day
and never came back.

29:08.187 --> 29:10.654
He's been gone
for a long time,
and I'm really worried.

29:10.656 --> 29:12.273
All right,
you know the only time
we're allowed to

29:12.274 --> 29:13.891
make noise is
on Doofens Day.

29:13.893 --> 29:15.392
So keep it...

29:15.394 --> 29:17.194
Are there four of
you in this room?

29:17.196 --> 29:19.196
Five, counting Perry.

29:19.198 --> 29:21.265
I see nothing.
I have plausible
deniability.

29:21.267 --> 29:23.167
Boy, your Candace
is much less curious
about what you're up to.

29:23.169 --> 29:25.936
What do you mean?

29:25.938 --> 29:28.305
Well, it seems like
our Candace has spent
her entire summer

29:28.307 --> 29:30.140
focused on
what we're doing.

29:30.142 --> 29:32.743
Summer? I think
that was outlawed
a long time ago.

29:32.745 --> 29:33.777
You guys don't
have summer?

29:33.779 --> 29:36.113
Well, that's...
That's terrible.

29:36.115 --> 29:40.817
Summer. It sounds
dangerous
yet oddly compelling.
What is it?

29:40.819 --> 29:43.921
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?

29:44.957 --> 29:48.859
<i> ♪ The days are longer</i>
<i> The nights are shorter</i>

29:48.861 --> 29:50.060
<i> ♪ The sun is shining</i>

29:50.062 --> 29:51.461
<i> ♪ It's noticeably warmer</i>

That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

31:42.808 --> 31:44.525
Like this summer
for instance.

31:44.526 --> 31:46.243
We built a rollercoaster,
we became one-hit wonders,

we traveled through

that we could help you?

32:17.392 --> 32:19.242
That we could have
made a great team?

32:19.244 --> 32:21.978
But I guess you can't have
teamwork without trust.

You don't have to

Well, you can.
But it would
just be "platyp."

33:08.026 --> 33:10.427
Well, I guess if you
guys can't help us
fix the remote,

33:10.429 --> 33:11.895
we could check
with Isabella.

33:11.897 --> 33:13.230
Who is Isabella?

33:13.232 --> 33:15.298

Relax! We've been

you can...

Hey! It's Buford.
Who are you guys?

33:43.095 --> 33:45.529
We're Candace's brothers.
We're going to Isabella's.

33:45.531 --> 33:47.130
Are you part of
the Resistance?

33:47.132 --> 33:49.199
I used to be
in the Resistance,

33:49.201 --> 33:52.135
but I got so good
at it that I started
resisting them.

33:52.137 --> 33:54.504

the Other-Dimensionator!

33:54.506 --> 33:56.706

The Other-Dimensionator is
back in the other

34:00.446 --> 34:03.079
Okay, step one is,
push this button.

34:11.523 --> 34:13.523
Now that
I think about it,

34:13.525 --> 34:16.493
those two boys made some
modifications to my design

34:16.495 --> 34:19.161
which may have
allowed it to...
You know...

34:19.164 --> 34:20.746
To work.

34:20.748 --> 34:22.331
Great, now I need
those two boys?

Ah! Perry the Platypus!

34:27.639 --> 34:31.241
Jinx!
You owe me two sodas!

34:31.243 --> 34:33.109
Listen, Perry the
Platypus,
I know I told you

34:33.110 --> 34:35.212
if you turned yourself in
I wouldn't hurt your
friends,

34:35.214 --> 34:37.246
but change of plans!

34:37.248 --> 34:40.083
Now I need to hunt
them down which might
involve a little hurting.

34:40.085 --> 34:43.053
I know that makes me
a liar, but hello! Evil!

34:44.623 --> 34:47.056
Come on,
Isabella's house
is right through...

34:54.166 --> 34:54.731
What you doing?

34:54.733 --> 34:57.767
Isabella?

34:57.769 --> 35:00.737
Do I know you?
Hey, Isabella!

35:00.739 --> 35:03.306
Him I know.
Buford, what do you want?

35:03.308 --> 35:05.108
I thought you were
resisting us?

35:05.110 --> 35:07.010
I was helping
Candace's brothers
cross the street.

35:07.012 --> 35:09.379
Candace has two sets
of twin brothers?

35:09.381 --> 35:12.148
No, he and I are
from another dimension.

35:12.150 --> 35:13.450
We're trying
to get back.

35:13.452 --> 35:14.584
All right, girls,
release them.

35:20.459 --> 35:22.192
Why would you want to come
to this dimension, anyway?

35:22.194 --> 35:24.060
Well, we didn't mean
to come here.

35:24.062 --> 35:26.630
Now we can't get back
unless we can fix
this device.

35:26.631 --> 35:29.199
Well, we may have
someone who can
help you. Dr. Baljeet.

35:29.201 --> 35:30.267
Baljeet!

35:30.269 --> 35:32.536
That's Dr. Baljeet to you!

35:32.538 --> 35:34.704
Were you not listening?
Here is the crux
of your problem.

35:34.706 --> 35:37.707
Think of the universe
and all of the many
dimensions as circular.

35:37.709 --> 35:40.076
The energy flows
between the dimensions
like this, clockwise.

35:40.078 --> 35:44.481
Say this is your dimension
and this is our dimension.

35:44.483 --> 35:46.349
You traveled with
the flow of energy.

35:46.351 --> 35:48.285
So going clockwise
would be easy!

35:48.287 --> 35:51.555
Going counter clockwise
would take 8 million
gigawatts of energy,

35:51.557 --> 35:54.190
overloading
the local power grid.

35:54.192 --> 35:56.092
I have prepared
a little song to help
illustrate my point.

35:56.094 --> 35:58.061
<i> ♪ If you travel</i>
<i> through dimensions</i>

35:58.063 --> 36:01.197

<i> ♪ Going counter clockwise</i>

<i> ♪ overloading</i>

36:08.173 --> 36:09.773
I know,
it needs a chorus.

36:09.775 --> 36:12.025
Anyway, without the
8 million gigawatts,

36:12.026 --> 36:14.276
you would have
to go clockwise,
the long way around.

36:14.279 --> 36:16.179
Theoretically,
you would get home
but there is no telling

36:16.181 --> 36:18.114
how many dimensions
you would have to
go through.

36:18.116 --> 36:20.183
Well, do you think
you can help us
get enough power

36:20.185 --> 36:21.952
to open the window
backwards
so we can get home?

36:21.953 --> 36:23.720
Well, we should probably
ask our leader.

36:23.722 --> 36:25.655
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Ask your leader what?

36:25.657 --> 36:27.290

36:27.292 --> 36:30.126
Who made the topiary
out of wild parsnips?

36:30.128 --> 36:31.795
I'm allergic,
and it's messing up
my voice.

36:31.797 --> 36:34.264
Candace, you're the leader
of the resistance?

36:34.266 --> 36:37.167
What are you two
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
doing here?

36:37.169 --> 36:39.569
Never mind,
I'll deal with you later.
You two,

36:39.571 --> 36:42.172
I've been spending
all these years trying
to keep my brothers safe

36:42.174 --> 36:44.641
and suddenly their faces
are
all over the Doofen
Channel.

36:44.643 --> 36:45.809
We're just trying
to get home.

36:45.811 --> 36:47.444
Well, what's stopping you?

36:47.446 --> 36:50.146
Right now?
Quantum physics.
Baljeet.

36:50.148 --> 36:51.815
We need to generate
8 million gigawatts

36:51.817 --> 36:53.406
for inter-dimensional
travel.

36:53.407 --> 36:54.996
Then we've got
work to do.

36:54.997 --> 36:56.586
Isabella, start
redirecting the power.
Aye aye!

36:56.588 --> 36:58.321
Gretchen! Monitor
the Doofen Channel.

36:58.323 --> 36:59.840
Make sure we're not
raising any alarms.

36:59.841 --> 37:01.358
I'm on it.
Buford, keep resisting.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.777
No!
Excellent.

37:03.778 --> 37:06.195

get rid of that topiary!

I may reason with you!

build a shrine to it?

it actually worked.

I was hurt.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.196
But even if
it was all an act,

38:13.198 --> 38:14.498
he's still

to save Perry from being

39:11.857 --> 39:13.323
What?
We'll explain on the way.

39:13.325 --> 39:14.691
So, how do I dress
in your dimension?

39:14.693 --> 39:17.427
Hey, is that me?
I look good!

39:17.429 --> 39:19.262
Oh, no.
You two stay here.

But we want to help.
That's an order!

CANDACE: Wait,
so in this dimension,
Perry is a secret agent?

39:28.807 --> 39:30.907
No, in this dimension
he's a cyborg.

39:30.909 --> 39:32.709
So, where is he an agent?

39:32.711 --> 39:34.477
That would be

39:34.479 --> 39:35.678
But we're not in
our dimension now.

39:35.680 --> 39:38.882
Okay, I'm having trouble
processing this.

39:38.884 --> 39:40.550
Now I wish
I hadn't thrown away
that pamphlet.

39:41.686 --> 39:43.603
And why are we
in mine cars?

39:43.604 --> 39:45.521
This'll take us as far
as the underground
entrance

39:45.524 --> 39:47.124
to Doof's headquarters.

39:47.125 --> 39:48.725
From there we go up
the ventilation shaft.

39:48.727 --> 39:50.627
The detainment center
is on level four.

39:50.629 --> 39:52.061
And the snack bar's
on level five!

39:52.063 --> 39:53.997
If there's time.

39:53.999 --> 39:56.566
Buford.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.067
I'm just gonna
get some nachos.

40:05.610 --> 40:08.645
So, if there's another me
and another them,

40:08.647 --> 40:11.981
then there must also be
a Jeremy Johnson here,
too, right?

40:11.983 --> 40:14.384
Huh? Oh, yeah,
Johnson, Jeremy.

40:14.386 --> 40:16.820
Leads a three-man strike
team on the north side.
Good soldier.

40:16.822 --> 40:19.673
Good soldier?
That's all you
think of him?

40:19.674 --> 40:22.525
Don't you think
he's dreamy or cool
or even cute?

40:22.527 --> 40:23.793
Tell me at least
you think he's cute.

40:25.497 --> 40:26.896
Cute doesn't win
the war, kid.

40:27.799 --> 40:30.466
Oh. Well, I guess.

40:30.468 --> 40:33.369
But what do you guys
do around here for,
you know, fun?

40:33.371 --> 40:35.071
Look, "Candace" is it?

40:35.073 --> 40:37.874
No offense, but fun
isn't really on my agenda.

40:37.876 --> 40:39.976
You know, since
Doofenshmirtz
took over the tri-state
area,

40:39.978 --> 40:41.978
even though
I was a little girl,

40:41.980 --> 40:43.546
I've been focused
on one thing
and one thing only.

40:43.548 --> 40:45.348
He's going down,
down, down.

40:45.350 --> 40:46.716
Down, down, down, I know.

40:46.718 --> 40:48.518
But what about BFF's?
Or slumber parties?

40:48.520 --> 40:50.119
Or busting your
little brothers?

40:50.121 --> 40:52.822
Busting my brothers?

40:52.824 --> 40:55.525
I spent every day
of my life trying to
protect my little
brothers.

40:55.527 --> 40:56.860
I had to grow up
pretty quick around here

40:56.862 --> 40:58.494
to make sure
they didn't have to.

40:58.496 --> 41:00.797
Gee, you make growing up
sound like it's a bad
thing.

41:00.799 --> 41:04.400
It is what it is.
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect the ones I
love.

41:04.402 --> 41:05.935
Aw! Thanks, sis!

41:05.937 --> 41:07.437
What are you guys
doing here?

41:07.438 --> 41:08.938
We're here to help.
Sir, we're nearing
the target!

41:08.940 --> 41:11.107
Don't move!

41:16.448 --> 41:19.148
Okay, people,
change of plans.

41:19.150 --> 41:20.850
This is as far as we go.

41:20.851 --> 41:22.551
We're not going
to help them?

41:22.554 --> 41:24.638
No, we're gonna
get you two home
where it's safe.

41:24.639 --> 41:26.723
But we wanna...
Look, this isn't our
fight.

41:26.725 --> 41:31.394
It's their fight,
and you two shouldn't
have gotten involved.

41:31.396 --> 41:32.495
Maybe none of us should
have.
Now we're out of here.

41:36.067 --> 41:38.768
I don't remember it being
so dark down here.

41:38.770 --> 41:40.570
Dark?
That's because it's a
trap!

41:40.572 --> 41:43.106
And if it was light,
you would have
seen us and run away,

41:43.108 --> 41:45.475
hence ruining the trap!

41:45.477 --> 41:46.776
I think they get that.

41:46.778 --> 41:48.778
PHINEAS: Perry!

41:48.780 --> 41:51.981
We, uh... We, well,
came to rescue you.

41:54.391 --> 41:56.057
So far it's not going
as well as we'd hoped.

41:56.327 --> 41:57.826
We didn't have
a lot of time to,

41:57.828 --> 41:59.361
you know, plan
something elaborate,

41:59.363 --> 42:01.763
but I guess
we could have created
some sort of diversion

42:01.765 --> 42:03.632
just in case...

42:03.634 --> 42:06.668
(SIGHS)
Yeah, we could have
thought this out more.

42:06.670 --> 42:10.839
(LAUGHS) I got you
and I got your
little friends, too!

42:10.841 --> 42:14.109
Game over! You lose!
I win!

42:14.111 --> 42:17.346
Mark this the hour
of your doom,
Perry the Platypus.

42:18.082 --> 42:20.315
Three forty...

42:20.317 --> 42:22.818
I got one of these
watches with just
the little hash marks.

42:22.820 --> 42:24.820
It doesn't even have
the numbers on it.

42:24.822 --> 42:26.755
Let's just say
it's between
3:30 and 4:00,

42:26.757 --> 42:27.055
Eastern Standard Time.

42:30.694 --> 42:31.760
Whoa!
(SCREAMS)

42:35.366 --> 42:38.734
<i> I told you,</i>
<i> not between</i>
<i> 3:30 and 4:00!</i>

42:42.973 --> 42:44.556
They're getting away!

42:44.557 --> 42:46.140
(ALARM BLARING)

42:46.143 --> 42:48.143
I knew this was
a bad idea. All right,
everyone in the cars!

42:49.246 --> 42:52.714
Go, go, go, go, go!
Isabella, start the motor!

42:52.716 --> 42:54.783
Yes, sir.

42:56.687 --> 42:58.787
I got it.

43:02.159 --> 43:04.726
You two,
keep your heads down
and remember your
training!

43:04.728 --> 43:05.994
We never had
any training!

43:05.995 --> 43:07.261
Well, keep your
heads down!

43:07.264 --> 43:09.064
Consider yourself trained.
This is going to be close.

43:12.403 --> 43:14.269
All right,
you rust buckets.
Let's dance.

43:21.879 --> 43:24.179
Um, can you do that?

43:24.181 --> 43:24.980
Well, apparently.

43:31.155 --> 43:34.089
I am so in love
with her right now.

43:34.091 --> 43:35.824
What?
Nothing.

43:35.826 --> 43:37.759
If we can get
to the north tunnel
before they get to us,

43:37.761 --> 43:39.495
I can trip
the security door.

43:39.496 --> 43:41.230
Isabella, can you
give us more throttle?

43:41.232 --> 43:43.098
It's all the way in, sir!

43:43.100 --> 43:46.001
All right, hang tough.
This is going to get
hairy.

43:52.009 --> 43:53.508
Can we make those turns
at this speed?

43:53.510 --> 43:54.009
Well, we're about
to find out.

44:09.460 --> 44:10.959
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

44:15.266 --> 44:17.132
There it is.
We should be okay
if we can hold off
these...

44:24.341 --> 44:25.674
Can we do that?

44:25.675 --> 44:27.008
No. Keep your head down.

44:37.855 --> 44:39.288
We're slowing down, sir!

44:39.290 --> 44:40.489
Keep it on the floor!

44:40.491 --> 44:43.025
It's on the floor.

44:43.027 --> 44:45.527
There's too much track,
sir.
I don't think we're going
to make it!

44:45.529 --> 44:47.129
Everyone,
to the front now!

44:47.131 --> 44:48.297
We're going to have
to cut loose these...

44:50.501 --> 44:51.900
The motor's overheating!

44:58.142 --> 44:59.574
Sorry, guys.
You're on your own.

45:04.248 --> 45:05.847
PHINEAS 2D:
What are you doing?

45:05.849 --> 45:08.083
My job.
Protecting you two.

45:08.085 --> 45:10.385
We've got to go back
and help them.

45:10.387 --> 45:11.853
That's not our fight.

45:11.855 --> 45:13.221
But you just
abandoned them!

45:13.223 --> 45:15.057
We could have made it!
We could have all made it!

45:15.059 --> 45:16.625
Or we could have
all been captured,

45:16.626 --> 45:18.192
and I wasn't going
to take that chance.

45:18.195 --> 45:20.195
These are
the tough choices, people.

45:20.197 --> 45:21.530
Somebody's got to
be the adult here.

45:21.532 --> 45:23.432
You two are safe,
and that's what's
important.

45:23.434 --> 45:24.066
But... But... But...
End of discussion.

45:34.178 --> 45:38.347
Man, I had my heart set
on those nachos.

45:38.349 --> 45:40.349
Look, mysterious force,

45:40.350 --> 45:42.350
I feel a little awkward
talking to you

45:42.353 --> 45:46.521
since I didn't believe
in you at first because,
you know, it's crazy.

45:46.523 --> 45:49.291
But then I saw you
eat my friend,

45:49.293 --> 45:53.095
so I've made
a little shrine here.

45:53.097 --> 45:57.332
It's nice.
There's a banana and...
Oh! Mr. Miggins.

45:57.334 --> 46:01.370
So I hope
this makes up for the
whole disbelief thing.

46:02.506 --> 46:04.906
Are we, uh...
Are we good?

46:07.277 --> 46:11.980
Now you have no choice
but to fix my machine.

46:11.982 --> 46:13.281
No.
That's not one
of your choices.

46:13.283 --> 46:14.583
Fix the machine!
No.

46:14.585 --> 46:17.119
Can I...
Can I say something?

46:17.121 --> 46:19.488
So, I think I'm up-to-date
on
the whole Perry Agent
thing.

46:19.490 --> 46:21.990
Strangely, that's the
most normal thing that's
happened this afternoon,

46:21.992 --> 46:24.993
but who exactly
is this guy?

46:26.063 --> 46:28.029
Fix it!
No.

46:28.031 --> 46:31.199
Look, I would make myself
do it but apparently
he's an idiot.

46:31.201 --> 46:33.001
Hey!
Fix the machine!

46:33.003 --> 46:34.653
No.

46:34.654 --> 46:36.304
All right, then,
you've forced my hand.

46:39.243 --> 46:40.609
Fix the machine!

46:40.611 --> 46:42.344
No.
Really?

46:42.346 --> 46:44.312
When I was your age,
I did anything
a puppet told me to do.

46:44.314 --> 46:45.647
How old do you think
we are?

46:45.649 --> 46:47.549
I don't know.
One, two?

46:47.551 --> 46:49.801
You know,
it's hard to tell
with the one eye.

46:49.802 --> 46:52.052
Anyway, I don't know
why you're being
so uncooperative.

46:52.055 --> 46:54.489
All I'm asking you to do
is make my machine work

46:54.491 --> 46:57.659
so I can invade
and conquer your world
and enslave your loved
ones.

46:57.661 --> 46:59.961
See, that's just it.

46:59.963 --> 47:01.997
Why would we do something
that would lead to our
own self-destruction?

47:01.999 --> 47:03.999
Self-destruction?
Self-destruct...
Wait a...

47:04.001 --> 47:05.751
Wait, that's it.
I remember now.

47:05.752 --> 47:07.502
They took out my
self-destruct button.

47:07.504 --> 47:09.704
I don't know why
I put it back in,
but here.

47:09.706 --> 47:12.974
I'll just rewire this,
like so, and there.

47:14.478 --> 47:18.680
It's working! It's
working!
It's functioning properly!

47:18.682 --> 47:21.683
Well, look who just
became redundant.

47:23.020 --> 47:24.286
Send them
to their doom!

47:25.689 --> 47:26.054
Yes, her, too.

47:28.091 --> 47:29.624
Yes, yes, everyone.

47:29.626 --> 47:31.693
Doom, doom,
doom and doom.
Doom!

47:31.695 --> 47:33.528
Jinx!
You owe me three sodas.

47:33.530 --> 47:34.729
Okay, doom for him, too.

47:35.532 --> 47:37.666
What? But I'm you!

47:37.668 --> 47:39.668
Doom!

47:39.670 --> 47:42.671
Wow, if I had
a nickel for every time
I was doomed by a puppet,

47:42.673 --> 47:44.673
I'd have two nickels.

47:44.675 --> 47:46.741
Which isn't a lot.
But it's weird that
it happened twice, right?

47:55.719 --> 47:59.087
<i> Welcome, doomed guests.</i>

47:59.089 --> 48:01.623
<i> Come on, keep trudging.</i>
<i> Doom is thataway.</i>

48:07.564 --> 48:11.099
I would say, so far,
adulthood gets about
a three.

48:11.101 --> 48:13.168
You know,
this may be as
good as it gets.

48:16.240 --> 48:19.441
<i> And now for my all-time</i>
<i> favorite game.</i>

48:19.443 --> 48:21.276
<i> Poke the Goozim</i>
<i> with a stick.</i>

48:22.679 --> 48:24.446
<i> Surrounded by lava.</i>

48:24.448 --> 48:27.315
<i> My second favorite game</i>
<i> is backgammon. Love it!</i>

48:27.317 --> 48:29.751
Whoa! Whoa!
Hold the phone.
I could be useful.

48:29.753 --> 48:32.437
What if you need a kidney

48:32.438 --> 48:35.122
or a stand-in
for boring functions
you have to attend?

48:35.125 --> 48:36.191
Or another kidney?

48:37.361 --> 48:38.527
<i> Doom!</i>

48:38.529 --> 48:40.529
Pooh.

48:45.035 --> 48:46.067
(ROARING)

48:49.406 --> 48:52.474
<i> Cranky, cranky, cranky.</i>
<i> Oh, I love the crank!</i>

48:58.815 --> 49:00.649
I'll be honest, Ferb.

49:00.650 --> 49:02.484
I'm having a hard time
putting a positive spin
on this.

49:02.486 --> 49:05.353
Blah, blah, blah,
two-car garage, etcetera.

49:05.355 --> 49:06.087
Yeah? Well,
welcome to my life!

49:08.692 --> 49:11.259
Whoa, deja vu-ish.

49:13.430 --> 49:15.430
Perry, check out
that guard!

49:16.533 --> 49:17.666
Keys!

49:24.374 --> 49:25.674
Cool! Look out!

49:29.479 --> 49:32.180
Ow! Is this the plan?

49:32.182 --> 49:33.932
Tell me
this isn't the plan!

49:33.933 --> 49:35.683
NORMBOT: <i> You are</i>
<i> tampering</i>
<i> with the property of...</i>

49:35.686 --> 49:36.751
<i> Let's make omelets!</i>

49:42.125 --> 49:43.491
DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Can you
get a little more lift
out of this thing?

49:43.493 --> 49:44.910
I think I just
bruised a kidney.

49:44.911 --> 49:46.328
NORM 2D:
<i> My bicycle is missing!</i>

49:48.098 --> 49:49.264

<i> Already?</i>

50:24.568 --> 50:28.203
Okay, I see where
you're going with this...

50:28.205 --> 50:30.138
I officially prefer
our dimension!

50:30.140 --> 50:30.872
(SCREAMS)

50:33.710 --> 50:35.577
DOOFENSHMIRTZ:
This may not be the
best time to tell you,

50:35.579 --> 50:39.347
but I actually flunked
jungle gym in grade
school.

50:39.349 --> 50:41.616
I just couldn't get the
hang
of all the climbing...
(SCREAMS)

50:50.494 --> 50:52.761
Oh, great,
you caught it!
Unlock me!

50:52.763 --> 50:54.262
Are you even
paying attention?

50:55.732 --> 50:58.266
That's right.
It can wait. Later!

51:04.574 --> 51:07.175
<i> More guards!</i>

51:07.177 --> 51:08.677
<i> It's muffin time, sir!</i>
<i> You're broken!</i>

Yay, other dimension
Candace!

51:51.588 --> 51:53.588

I've had just about
enough of you, you...

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:48.858
Ow! What is on this!

01:06:14.152 --> 01:06:16.953
I was wrong, Stacy,
about everything.

01:06:16.955 --> 01:06:19.789
I'm not a grown-up.
I can't control
mysterious forces.

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:20.857
I can't even get my mom
to see what my brothers
are doing!

01:06:22.594 --> 01:06:24.828
Stacy, that's it!

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.763
I can't get my mom

are doing!

01:06:26.765 --> 01:06:28.131
Candace,
where are you going?

01:06:28.133 --> 01:06:30.300
I'm gonna bust my
brothers to my mom!

01:06:30.302 --> 01:06:31.801
And I'm gonna fail!

01:06:31.803 --> 01:06:34.604
No, it's Heinz

01:06:34.606 --> 01:06:36.706

this morning.

Oh, that she remembers.

Mom!

01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:53.056
Candace, what are you
doing here?

01:06:53.058 --> 01:06:54.824
You got to come outside
and bust the boys!

01:06:54.826 --> 01:06:56.743
I'm not leaving now.

01:06:56.744 --> 01:06:58.661
The girl is about to
forgive the guy for the
cliche misunderstanding.

01:06:58.663 --> 01:07:00.797
Well, after she battles
these robots.

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:02.765
Whoa! This 3-D is amazing!

01:07:05.303 --> 01:07:05.902
Ferb, we'll handle it
down here.

01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:08.638
Go help Phineas!

01:07:37.969 --> 01:07:41.371
Come on, you stupid thing.
Work!

01:07:41.373 --> 01:07:44.174
So that dish must be
what's controlling
the robots.

01:07:44.176 --> 01:07:46.042
Maybe I don't need
to close the portal

01:07:46.044 --> 01:07:47.343
if I could just
take out that...

01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:48.745
Oh, yeah!

01:07:49.681 --> 01:07:51.981
Oh, no, you don't.

01:07:51.983 --> 01:07:54.684
Now the baseball
is on the other foot.

Or however that
saying goes, I'm not...
I'm not really sure.

Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.690
You know, all that's
going to happen from
you guys coming up here

01:08:01.693 --> 01:08:05.695
is that I'm going to have
a brand-new platyborg.
(LAUGHS)

01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:07.797
And maybe even a boyborg!

01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:09.399
Try saying that
five times fast.

01:08:09.401 --> 01:08:12.735
Boyborg, boyborg, boyborg,
boyborg, boyborg...

01:08:12.737 --> 01:08:14.270

No, what have you done?

01:09:47.932 --> 01:09:50.033
It's weird that Perry's
a secret agent, huh?

01:09:50.035 --> 01:09:52.502
Yeah, but it was obvious
in retrospect.

01:09:52.504 --> 01:09:53.386
Has anyone
seen my pants?

01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:54.269
Yeah, they're
over there.

01:09:54.272 --> 01:09:58.141
Wolverines!

Mom, if you care
one iota about me,

01:10:00.312 --> 01:10:03.446
your family, and your
city,
you'll come outside
with me right now!

01:10:03.448 --> 01:10:05.281
Well, I guess I could
use some more popcorn.

01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:06.949
Great! Come on,
come on, come on,
come on!

Ferb! Bro, I just hit
the best home run ever!

01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:26.903
Now, tremble before me!

01:10:26.905 --> 01:10:30.306
No, I'm down here.
See, one last trick
up my sleeve.

01:10:30.308 --> 01:10:34.043
It's me! I'm the trick
up my own sleeves,

Hey!

01:10:49.327 --> 01:10:52.295
What? I'm kind of
in the middle of
something here.

01:10:52.297 --> 01:10:55.431
I got a little something
just for you.

01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:58.968
Here.

01:11:02.474 --> 01:11:03.540
Choo-Choo!

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:04.607
Yeah, it's mine.
See, I told you
I never lost it.

01:11:04.609 --> 01:11:07.510
It was in a box
in my pantry labeled
"VHS tapes."

01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:10.246
Go figure.
Anyway, you can have it.

01:11:10.248 --> 01:11:13.116
I can't believe it!
Choo-Choo, it is you!

01:11:13.118 --> 01:11:19.021
Heart melting,
back-story resolving,
evilness diminishing.

01:11:19.023 --> 01:11:20.923
It's the least I can do.

01:11:20.925 --> 01:11:22.492
You know,
I don't even know
what I was thinking

01:11:22.494 --> 01:11:24.594
with the whole
evil robots thing.

01:11:24.596 --> 01:11:27.363
Actually,
when I look around,
I'm really embarrassed.

01:11:27.365 --> 01:11:29.465
Let me clean this up.
Look! Self-destruct
button.

Yeah. Here we go!

Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, hurry, hurry!

01:11:42.414 --> 01:11:45.047
Do I even need to say
"there's nothing there"
anymore?

01:11:45.049 --> 01:11:47.450
Mom, you can say it
all you want.
There's nothing there!

01:11:47.452 --> 01:11:50.486
Whoo-hoo! I did it,
I saved the world!

01:11:52.056 --> 01:11:52.989
You can go back
to your movie now.

01:11:58.596 --> 01:12:00.463
Yeah, you know what?
We're totally cool now.

01:12:00.465 --> 01:12:02.265
I'm just gonna go
return to my home

01:12:02.267 --> 01:12:04.467
and live out
the rest of my days
with my Choo-Choo.

against humanity had just
completely slipped my
mind.

just see that?
I saved Danville!

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:19.982
Good job, soldier.

01:12:19.984 --> 01:12:21.717
So what'll you do now?

01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:24.620
Wow, I haven't thought
of anything but busting
Doofenshmirtz for years.

01:12:24.622 --> 01:12:26.539
I don't know.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.457
Well, I know what
interests I'd pursue.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.860
Hey! Here you all are.

01:12:30.861 --> 01:12:33.261
I'll take that
under consideration.
What about you, Candace?

01:12:33.264 --> 01:12:35.298
You know,
after all of this,

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.533
I'm gonna give myself
a little more time
to be young.

01:12:37.535 --> 01:12:39.101
It's not such
a bad place to be.

01:12:39.103 --> 01:12:41.437
You know what?
Me, too.

01:12:41.439 --> 01:12:44.273
Hey, I just wanted to
say thanks for telling us
all about summer,

01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:46.476
you know,
opening our horizons,

01:12:46.478 --> 01:12:48.344
and teaching Ferb
classical guitar.

Hey! It's our Perry!
Perry!

01:12:57.422 --> 01:13:00.523
Looks like
the evil was fried
right out of him.

01:13:00.525 --> 01:13:02.041
Sorry he's mostly
made of metal now.

01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.558
Are you kidding?
That makes him
extra cool!

01:13:03.561 --> 01:13:06.095
Thanks so much, guys.

01:13:06.097 --> 01:13:07.597
I'm glad
we could help.

01:13:12.337 --> 01:13:14.737
Man, this has been
the greatest day ever.

01:13:14.739 --> 01:13:16.405
Imagine how much fun
we can have together

01:13:16.407 --> 01:13:18.274
now that we know
you're a secret agent.

01:13:18.276 --> 01:13:21.744
Yes, yes,
the next 15 minutes
should be a real hoot.

01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:24.714
Well, then, of course,
Agent P will be
sent away forever.

01:13:24.716 --> 01:13:26.699
What?
You didn't know?

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.683
Didn't he give you
a pamphlet?
We threw it away.

01:13:28.686 --> 01:13:30.319
Does anyone
read those things?

01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:32.088
I tried to warn you, sir.

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:35.258
Kids, I'm sorry
but now that Agent P's
cover has been blown,

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.226
you won't be allowed
to see him anymore.

01:13:37.228 --> 01:13:40.129
That's why
you didn't want us
to know your secret.

01:13:40.131 --> 01:13:41.797
So we'll never see
Perry again?

01:13:41.799 --> 01:13:43.366
There has to be
another way.

01:13:43.368 --> 01:13:46.202
Sorry, Phineas.
It isn't safe.
You know too much.

01:13:46.204 --> 01:13:49.272
Now I never wished
so much that I could
unknow something.

01:13:49.274 --> 01:13:50.740
Sir, maybe
there is a way.

01:13:50.742 --> 01:13:53.743
What about
Dr. Doofenshmirtz's
Amnesianator?

01:13:53.745 --> 01:13:56.512
I never built
an Amnesianator.

01:13:56.514 --> 01:13:59.148
I think I'd remember
building something
like that.

01:13:59.149 --> 01:14:01.783
Well, that might work.
But you'd all have to
agree.

01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:05.555
So our choice is to either
forget the best day ever,

01:14:05.557 --> 01:14:07.657
forget the biggest
adventure
we've ever had,

01:14:07.659 --> 01:14:09.525
and forget
meeting Agent P,

01:14:09.527 --> 01:14:12.395
or remember today,
but never see Perry again?

01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:15.264
Well, we've had
a lot of great days.

01:14:15.266 --> 01:14:17.833
But we only have
one Perry.

01:14:17.835 --> 01:14:19.168
Agreed.

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:20.836
ALL: Yeah!

MONOGRAM:
All right, everybody.
Tall kids in the back.

01:14:23.508 --> 01:14:24.674
Just need to do
a little more
programming here

01:14:24.676 --> 01:14:26.776
and we'll be
ready to roll.

01:14:26.778 --> 01:14:28.678
Hey, buddy, Ferb and I
just wanted to say
our goodbyes.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.514
You know, we thought
we'd finally met
the real you

01:14:31.516 --> 01:14:34.083
when we found out
you were Agent P,

01:14:34.084 --> 01:14:36.651
but the fact is,
pet, secret agent,
they're both the real you.

01:14:36.654 --> 01:14:39.088
You are now and
always have been

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:41.724
a great pet
and a great friend.

01:14:41.726 --> 01:14:44.160
We're gonna
miss you, Agent P.

01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:46.796
I love you, pal.

01:14:46.798 --> 01:14:48.564
Sir, are you crying?

01:14:48.566 --> 01:14:49.632
No, I'm sweating
through my eyes.

01:14:49.634 --> 01:14:52.735
Okay, sir.
We're ready.

01:14:52.737 --> 01:14:54.503
Okay, Karl.
We're set.

01:14:56.274 --> 01:14:59.208
Um, Major Monogram?
Yes?

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:01.410
So none of us
will remember
any of today?

01:15:01.412 --> 01:15:02.511
That's right.

01:15:02.513 --> 01:15:03.446
