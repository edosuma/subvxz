WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:04.572
Previously on ER.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.574
SAM:
Got a letter from your dad.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.610
Steve was saying that he's got
some new job in Colorado.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.046
KOVAC:
Sam, you've got to tell
Alex the truth.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.147
Alex!

00:15.116 --> 00:16.550
It's all going to be okay.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:36.770 --> 00:38.206
He's 12.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.441
MAN:
When was the last time
you saw him?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.843
Around 8:30.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.279
So four and a half
hours ago?

00:45.279 --> 00:48.349
Friends, relatives, anyone
he might be with?

00:48.349 --> 00:50.851
We've been calling and driving
around.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.253
There's nothing.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.488
Any fights,
school problems?

00:54.488 --> 00:56.190
We had an argument.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.760
I went upstairs to take a shower
and get ready for bed.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.463
And about an hour later,

01:02.463 --> 01:06.267
Visa called for an authorization
on my card.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.337
He went to the bus station
and tried to buy a ticket.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.704
A ticket to where?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.573
Colorado.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.208
Why Colorado?

01:14.208 --> 01:15.643
His dad is there.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.877
What about
his home situation?

01:16.877 --> 01:19.213
Is it stable?
Drugs? Violence?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.282
Alex has a good home.

01:21.282 --> 01:25.219
What about dad?
Did you tell him Alex maybe
on his way or call him?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.255
He's not easy
to get a hold of.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.322
Why's that?

01:31.359 --> 01:32.793
He's in prison.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.795
SAM:
Alex doesn't know that

01:34.795 --> 01:36.464
his dad's in jail.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.700
He's been asking me if he can go
live with him.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.836
I'm sorry, shouldn't we be
calling Amtrak or the airlines?

01:42.836 --> 01:45.373
No. They won't board a minor
without parental consent.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.375
You got a recent photo?

01:47.375 --> 01:49.277
MAN:
This happens
all the time.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.413
Nine times out of ten, they're
back in 24 hours or less.

01:52.413 --> 01:55.183
Alex doesn't have 24 hours.
He's diabetic.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.617
He could be in a coma by this
time tomorrow,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.886
if he doesn't get his insulin.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.354
KOVAC:
Sam.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.822
We've gotta go by Shelley's.
Sam.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.857
Union Station and the park...
Sam, the car...

02:03.857 --> 02:06.327
He likes Navy Pier.
Maybe he went over there.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.362
And then we'll circle back
to the school

02:08.362 --> 02:10.330
and uh, the, the, the....
the arcade...

02:10.330 --> 02:12.366
We should be at
home when he calls.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.834
We'll check out Denny's
and McDonald's.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.669
Open the door open...
Sam, he's not...

02:15.669 --> 02:17.471
Please, open the door!

02:21.442 --> 02:23.511
Sam, when he calls,

02:23.511 --> 02:24.878
he'll call home.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.548
They said
we should be there.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.618
He knows how to monitor
his carbs, stay hydrated...

02:30.618 --> 02:35.323
He's too smart.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.559
He's stubborn and resourceful
and smart.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.897
He's not coming back.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.273
( sobbing )

04:43.517 --> 04:46.053
Oh... the day shift.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.555
( loud kiss )

04:47.555 --> 04:48.889
There is a God.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.858
Ew.
Hard night?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.059
Okay, everybody's here?
Good.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.362
It's 8:02, time for rounds.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.396
Curtain number one.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.430
Wait.
Ray, you're on.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.798
What?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.067
You're an R-2 now.
R-2s run the board.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.069
Uh, okay.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.671
Well, uh, okay,
curtain one.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.905
Foreign body
in the eye.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.740
Sanding his boat
without any eye gear.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.376
Shard of glass
under the lid.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.610
Corneal abrasion?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.044
Didn't get a chance
to check.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.546
Okay.
Jane, he's yours.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.382
Fluorescein, slit lamp,
exam, and home.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.484
In curtain three we have an
altered 19-year-old.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.951
Drank a gallon of antifreeze.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.421
Responding to fomepizole,
waiting on psych and ICU bed.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.755
Great, moving on.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.591
Whoa. This is a good teaching
case.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.927
Yeah. Take a minute and tell us
all about fomepizole.

05:26.927 --> 05:31.131
Uh, well,
it's pretty new.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.700
Yeah, what
does it do?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.570
Lowers the ethylene glycol
level?

05:36.570 --> 05:38.406
Tell them how.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.074
Increases renal excretion.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.510
LEWIS:
Anyone else?

05:42.510 --> 05:45.546
Does it inhibit alcohol
dehydrogenase?

05:45.546 --> 05:48.015
I think it might prevent
formation of acidic metabolites.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.850
Get it in early,
you'll avoid dialysis.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.720
I'm gonna read about this and
make a hand-out for you.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.755
No, R2's have to read
before rounds start.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.525
How? I just got here.
Then get here early.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.159
Teaching should
be spontaneous,
off the cuff.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.861
WOMAN:
Excuse me.
Is there somewhere

06:00.861 --> 06:03.931
I can breast feed? Been here
three hours. Kid needs to eat.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.768
Oh, yeah, yeah. There's a, uh,
family room down the hall.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.571
Mom, I'm starving.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.440
MORRIS:
All the way
on your left.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.741
How old is that kid?

06:13.741 --> 06:14.975
He's got
to be six.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.977
That is a little freaky.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.447
KOVAC:
Sam? Hey...

06:19.447 --> 06:21.148
( gasps ):
What?
It's okay.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.050
Did they call?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.553
No, just his picture on the TV.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.195
How long was I asleep for?

06:35.195 --> 06:37.631
About an hour.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.867
All right, we got to start
calling everybody again.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.201
You already called
everybody.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.871
They're going to
call us if some...

06:46.173 --> 06:49.977
Hi, Debbie.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.845
Yeah.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.682
No.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.849
No, huh?

06:55.849 --> 06:58.218
Okay, yeah, yeah,
of course.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.887
As soon as I hear anything.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.122
Hi, yes, this is Luka Kovac,
again.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.157
( phone ringing )

07:07.661 --> 07:08.729
Hello.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.763
LEWIS:
What is it?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.064
Altered traffic collision.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.100
GCS eight, systolic 100.
Let's bag her.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.668
What's your plan, Ray?

07:14.668 --> 07:17.705
All right, intubation, FAST exam
and a head CT.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.139
Okay, I'll be in curtain two.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.240
Dr. Lewis...

07:20.240 --> 07:21.909
Call me if you need me.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.744
I guess she trusts you.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.778
Uh, yeah.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.213
20 of etomidate,
100 of sux,

07:26.213 --> 07:27.881
portable c-spine and chest
to follow.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.850
Let's get that Sonosite ready.
Come here.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.251
You mind if I intubate?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.086
You might want to observe
one, first.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.688
Why do you use Etomidate?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.624
You need a sedative
with the paralytic.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.859
I know, but isn't it
true that Ketamine causes

07:38.859 --> 07:39.927
less respiratory
depression?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.629
Uh, maybe.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.097
Well, does it have a more
favorable hemodynamic profile?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.700
I mean, if you're concerned
about intra-abdominal
hemorrhaging,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.936
then it seems like you would
definitely want to...

07:48.936 --> 07:50.971
we use Etomidate because
it's a good drug.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.606
Okay, let me
take a look.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.007
Sat's up to 92.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.243
All right. Now pull the handle
at 45 degrees

07:56.243 --> 07:58.546
and never rock back
against the teeth.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.581
Shouldn't you give a
de-fasciculating
dose of Pavulon?

08:00.581 --> 08:01.715
Uh, sometimes we do.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.150
Is sux okay in crush injuries?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.985
Uh-huh.
Cricoid pressure.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.587
What about
hyperkalemia?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.255
Look, this is never
going to happen.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.090
Okay, the 8-0, it won't
pull through.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.626
All right, we need
a smaller tube. Bag her.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.161
Is sux okay in burn patients?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.096
Look, more observation,
and less conversation.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.931
We tube her and then
we chat.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.199
Okay?
Okay.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.768
Seven and a half.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.937
Okay, thank you.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.007
Sergeant Parker wont tell us
what this is about on the phone.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.709
We haven't found your son yet.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.977
12,000 fliers went out--

08:29.977 --> 08:32.111
precincts, hospitals,
state police.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.914
We notified the folks
in Colorado

08:33.914 --> 08:36.183
and we're getting some play
on local television.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.085
Please, have a seat.

08:38.085 --> 08:42.823
We canvassed the airline ticket
counters, Union Station, buses,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.694
nobody recognized
your son.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.929
Hey, thanks for
coming back down.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.332
Still nothing from Alex?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.635
No, you know, I'm sorry,
I don't understand

08:54.635 --> 08:56.303
why you couldn't
have over the phone.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.806
Why did you want us
to come down here?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.609
We got a report

09:01.609 --> 09:03.944
of an unidentified diabetic
kid in a coma.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.013
It matches your son's
general description.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.280
Where is he?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.049
In all likelihood,
it's not him.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.084
We're waiting for them
to fax a photo,

09:11.084 --> 09:12.953
but, uh,

09:12.953 --> 09:15.222
they're still working on him
at the hospital.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.224
Where is he?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.826
Iowa, Davenport, Iowa.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.694
It's 200 miles.
I'll drive.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.330
They'll figure out if it's him
before we can get there.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.365
If it's him, we'll be
that much closer.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.635
If it's not, we'll be
that much further.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.871
I can't just sit
waiting for a call
that they found Alex

09:30.871 --> 09:32.640
in a ditch or
a Dumpster!

09:32.640 --> 09:34.041
I can't, okay?
I can't.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.681
Tell Dubenko the second hemocue
was 12.1.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.915
Going to the O.R.?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.351
Yeah, FAST was positive,
needs an ex-lap.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.053
How did it go, Haleh?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.021
It was a little rough.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.257
Do you want to
give Dr. Barnett
some feedback?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.892
There wasn't much teaching.

09:51.892 --> 09:55.062
You seemed distracted by
questions from the interns.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.397
Well, they wouldn't
shut up.
Ray.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.133
His frustration prevented the
team from working together.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.935
There was a lot
of tension.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.905
It could have caused a delay in
diagnosing the splenic lac.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.073
Oh, please.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.240
Thank you, Haleh.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.977
Thank you. Thanks.
What was that about?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.813
Improving your skills,
making you a better teacher,
a better leader.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.915
And since when do nurses
evaluate the residents?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.784
Haleh has been here
long. She knows.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.318
I needed to treat this patient.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.754
You also need to create a
positive learning climate.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.390
Are you torturing all the R-2s
or is it just me?

10:23.390 --> 10:26.026
Ray, resolving TIA.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.128
Go.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.406
We must have missed it.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.042
Well, they said it's over a mile
from the Interstate...

10:42.042 --> 10:44.011
We've only gone...
Ah, that's it.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.208
Hello?
Anybody here?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.110
Excuse me?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.879
There's a button.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.881
Over there.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.217
( bell ringing )

11:24.217 --> 11:25.753
WOMAN:
Hold your horses,

11:25.753 --> 11:28.321
I'm coming.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.023
You have a boy in DKA?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.191
Security guard found him

11:31.191 --> 11:32.826
down behind Penney's
at the mall.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.194
Didn't have any ID.

11:34.194 --> 11:38.198
His blood sugar was
764, PH 7.10,

11:38.198 --> 11:41.835
GCS eight, ketones were
positive at 1 to 64.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.337
He's on I.V. saline,
insulin and potassium.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.808
He just started opening
his eyes on command.
You just missed Dr. Hahn.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.843
He went home to get
his digital camera

11:49.843 --> 11:54.414
so that we could send a picture
to the police in Chicago.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.116
KOVAC:
No, it wasn't him.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.251
Right. Thanks.

11:59.887 --> 12:00.988
Anything?

12:00.988 --> 12:04.792
No, not yet.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.826
( screaming )

12:05.826 --> 12:07.327
Damn it, Alex!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.310
Erica's fine to stay
at the apartment

12:23.310 --> 12:26.513
until we get back.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.982
He's not coming home, Luka.

12:49.036 --> 12:52.539
The keys?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.274
Where we going?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.977
Colorado.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.154
No infiltrate.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.856
Like I said,
fever without source.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.057
Everything okay?

13:10.057 --> 13:12.525
Well, he doesn't
have pneumonia.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.094
Urine?
All clear.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.262
Rapid strep?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.296
No clinical indication.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.865
Okay.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.067
Mason, can you open up
your mouth for me?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.101
I don't like that.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.535
Come on.
You're a big boy.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.971
I already did it.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.174
Okay, real quick-- ah?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.241
Ah.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.276
A little bigger.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.343
Ah.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.378
Any rash?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.379
No.
No.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.881
He looks good.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.482
Can you remove
his pajamas for me?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
Dr. Babinski had him
in a gown.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.552
I don't want to take off
my clothes again.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.188
I'm sorry, but
it's important, okay?

13:41.188 --> 13:43.356
You said we can go home.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.126
I want to go home!
Mason...

13:46.126 --> 13:48.095
I want to go home now!

13:48.095 --> 13:49.897
Mason, come on.
Ray?

13:49.897 --> 13:51.131
Two seconds.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.565
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.934
No!
One more time.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.002
No!

13:55.002 --> 13:56.569
Come on, Mason.
One more time.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.071
How's it going
in there?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.407
Uh, just looking
for a fever source.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.409
Babinski said
there wasn't one.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.412
You know how
it is with interns.
You got to check up on them.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.314
But not for 20 minutes.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.183
Ray, the interns are doctors.
You have to trust their skills.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.020
They were students
last week. They don't know
what they're doing.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.122
You're micromanaging every case.
It's bad for patient flow.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.589
Yeah, we were
caught up.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.026
Now we've got six and
20 in the rack.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.360
And that's my fault?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.562
I liked you better when
you were the closer.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.405
Still no service.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.107
We're about 30 miles
from Omaha,

14:34.107 --> 14:36.944
so we'll probably
get service soon.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.478
Where in Colorado?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.513
Huh?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.415
Where is Steve?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.351
Uh, Canon City.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.486
Where's that?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.056
In the mountains somewhere,
I think.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.191
I've never been.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.126
What?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.361
Colorado.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.496
I always wanted to go.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.131
I heard it's beautiful.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.968
Yeah.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.973
What were you and Alex fighting
about

15:05.973 --> 15:09.042
last night?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.978
The usual.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.513
Me?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.517
Us.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.988
( sighs )

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
I should have
just told him
the truth.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.293
He knew
we were having trouble.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.595
No, the truth
about his father.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.575
So after the attending leaves
you high and dry in trauma,

15:42.575 --> 15:45.212
you're going
to be critiqued
by a nurse.
That's weird.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.680
Even if the patient's crashing,
make nice with the newbies,
or be dinged.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.317
Ray, can I give another four
of morphine to McKenzie?

15:50.317 --> 15:51.751
Do you think he needs it?

15:51.751 --> 15:54.021
No, I just want him
to stop breathing.

15:54.021 --> 15:56.456
Fine. You're responsible
for every little thing
the intern does.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.526
But you question the history,
and they get all testy on you.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.561
Sounds like you
had a great day.
Yeah.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.031
You ready, Neela?
Tonight's all about you and me.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
And me.
Teddy Marsh,
new intern.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.267
Hello.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.469
My first shift--
an overnight, awesome.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.105
This is Neela.
She's the R-2.
She's in charge.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.773
You're mission:
clear that board by morning.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.642
I'm screwed.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.778
Antifreeze overdose
has been here all night
waiting on the ICU.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.049
Step it up. The day shift
wants to get out of here.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.683
Just remember,
fomepizole's an alcohol
dehydrogenase inhibitor

16:23.683 --> 16:25.385
and you'll be fine.
What?

16:25.385 --> 16:27.320
Neela, you're running rounds,
so let's start.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.712
It's about nine hours
to Denver.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.514
Think we'll
make it by dawn.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.748
You should sleep.
I'll drive.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.384
No, I'm okay.
No, I'm awake.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.619
Not sure I'll be
in the next four hours.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.788
Shoot. My cell phone battery
is almost dead.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.090
I should have
brought my charger.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.361
( sighs )

17:13.165 --> 17:14.166
Hey, Luka.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.106
Thank you.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.747
NEELA:
The calculated osmolality
is approximated

17:27.747 --> 17:29.649
by multiplying the sodium
concentration by two

17:29.649 --> 17:33.786
and adding glucose divided by 18
and the BUN over 2.8.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.855
Anyone have the numbers handy?

17:35.855 --> 17:38.125
That's okay, we'll make some up.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.160
Let's say his measured osms
are 300...

17:40.160 --> 17:42.395
What's this have
to do with a fractured rib?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.563
Absolutely nothing.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.764
I have a date.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.599
Go, we could be
here all night.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.700
Thank you.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.602
NEELA:
...divided by 2.8.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.538
20 minutes and we're only
on our second patient.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.140
Neela, try
to stay focused

17:53.140 --> 17:54.807
on the clinically relevant
teaching points.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.843
This is clinically relevant.
There's an osmolar gap.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.478
The interns need
to know meanings.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.546
Not right now.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.348
Stab wound!
Need some help here.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.615
Neela, take it with Marsh.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.451
Pratt and Morris,
finish running the board.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.652
Ready?

18:05.652 --> 18:08.255
My first trauma
as a doc. All right.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.524
Single stab to the right
chest. Agonal resps,
sats 84 on 15 liters.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.526
All right, trauma one,
let's go.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.500
Now enter the thoracic cavity
through the intercostal.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.734
Okay, I felt a pop.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.370
Okay, insert finger.

18:23.370 --> 18:27.407
Feel lung tissue, pass the tube
on a curved clamp.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.541
Pretty cool.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.410
My first night,
my first chest tube.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.445
The key is to avoid
the neurovascular bundle

18:32.445 --> 18:34.747
at the inferior margin
of the rib.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.882
The tube won't pass.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.218
All right, let me try.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.490
I can't find the tract.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.359
Sometimes you need to check
again with a finger.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.664
There is no tract. Did you enter
the thoracic cavity?

18:51.664 --> 18:52.932
I thought I did.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.534
Did you feel lung tissue?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.336
It was warm and soft.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.838
Lung tissue expands and
contracts with ventilation.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.908
Right.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.843
Now we're into
the pleura.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.778
I'm sorry.
I thought I was in.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.381
I'll do better
next time.
How you doing?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.617
Finishing up a chest tube.
Start a central line?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.253
I've got a cue ball vs.
cheek to sew up.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.521
A trauma patient
takes priority.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.256
O-silk?
Pulse is 98,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.725
BP is stable.
What's the big deal?
My guy needs

19:18.725 --> 19:20.960
a three-layer closure
on a complex stellate
facial lac.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.296
That could
take two hours.
Yeah.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.798
Let Plastics do it. Someone
needs check the board.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.234
I already told
the nurses

19:27.234 --> 19:29.269
to send labs
and X rays on everyone.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.703
Morris!
You've got
everything under control.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.938
Is that a vertical
mattress?

19:31.938 --> 19:33.940
No, it's horizontal!

19:57.930 --> 20:00.267
What are you doing?

20:00.267 --> 20:02.702
Bugs. It's
difficult to see.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.836
( sighs )

20:03.836 --> 20:05.372
Where are we?

20:05.372 --> 20:08.508
We passed Grand Island
about an hour ago.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.780
We should get to a phone
and call Chicago.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.814
Okay.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.550
What time is it?

20:17.550 --> 20:18.951
1:30.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.623
I was dreaming about Alex.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.660
He was two or three.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.363
And I needed a bathing suit,

20:30.363 --> 20:35.368
so I was looking through the
racks at some department store.

20:35.368 --> 20:39.806
When I looked back,
Alex was gone.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.974
He just vanished.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.010
I guess you don't have
to be Freud

20:44.010 --> 20:46.379
to figure that one out.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.854
I lost my son at the ocean.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.495
Daniella didn't want me
to take him,

21:02.495 --> 21:05.998
but I insisted. I was mad that
she didn't trust me.

21:05.998 --> 21:11.338
So, uh... we had a big fight
and she let us go.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.473
What happened?

21:13.473 --> 21:14.907
It was a very hot day,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.710
so everyone had come
to the beach.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.681
They have beaches
in Croatia?

21:21.681 --> 21:24.851
Beautiful beaches,
miles of them.

21:24.851 --> 21:29.856
Anyway, so, uh,
we found about
an inch of sand

21:29.856 --> 21:33.526
that wasn't already
taken and, uh,

21:33.526 --> 21:35.428
we went
down to the water.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.063
He wanted to build
a sand castle,

21:37.063 --> 21:44.404
so I went back up to pick up
his little shovel and bucket.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.039
And when I came back
he was gone.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.876
I looked everywhere.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.511
Ran up and down
the beach,

21:51.511 --> 21:55.448
the shops by the road,
into the water,

21:55.448 --> 21:57.016
couldn't find him.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.386
How long was he missing?

22:01.087 --> 22:02.889
Two hours.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.661
( sighs )

22:08.661 --> 22:10.697
Where was he?

22:10.697 --> 22:12.899
Some boy had a dog.

22:12.899 --> 22:16.102
The police found
him wandering.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.538
He knew his name
so they called our house

22:18.538 --> 22:20.006
and Daniella answered.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.846
When I got home, he was sitting
in a bathtub with his sister

22:26.846 --> 22:28.981
having a wonderful time.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.758
I went to the kitchen
and I cried by the sink

22:38.758 --> 22:40.927
with the water running.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.563
Mm.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.732
What was his name?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.434
Marco.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.940
Alex is going
to be all right, Sam.

22:53.940 --> 22:57.109
We're going to find
him and he's going
to be all right.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.685
It's 3:00 a.m.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.487
Shouldn't this be
slowing down by now?

23:07.487 --> 23:08.921
You've got a
dark cloud, Neela.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.457
Always have.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.492
12 more out there
triaging as we speak.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.161
Neurosurg's coming to see the
subdural, he'll need a unit bed.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.597
I'm going to lay down
for a couple hours?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.866
We've got three intubated
patients and a full board.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.835
You are more than capable
of managing whatever comes in.

23:22.835 --> 23:27.106
That's the fun of being
the big R-2. You get to be
queen of the night shift.

23:27.106 --> 23:31.177
I don't wanna be the queen.
I wanna get the board cleared
before the day shift.

23:31.177 --> 23:34.481
Give me a copy of your schedule?
Gonna avoid nights you're on.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.716
You going to bed
leaving me with this mess?

23:36.716 --> 23:37.950
You have him.
You busy?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.786
Want to present
my guy in three.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.489
Wake me only if it's
really, really important.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.856
He's going to bed?

23:43.856 --> 23:46.693
Yep, it's you and me
against the world.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.795
Chuny had me correct
your fentanyl order.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.129
It's "micrograms,"
not "milligrams."

23:50.129 --> 23:51.798
Oh, God.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.733
That could've led
to a serious mistake.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.134
Caught in time.
No harm.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.169
I am so sorry.
Thanks for fixing it.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.938
It's okay.
Got to learn somehow.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.573
What do you got?
37-year-old

24:00.573 --> 24:03.042
with a deltoid abscess.
Never done an I and D,

24:03.042 --> 24:05.878
thought you might
want to supervise.
Any other history?

24:05.878 --> 24:08.014
Chronic I.V. drug use,
that's about it.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.215
Physical?

24:09.215 --> 24:10.917
Four-by-five
fluctuant lesion

24:10.917 --> 24:12.952
on the lateral aspect
of the upper arm.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.987
The remainder
of the exam was
entirely normal.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.890
Hey, Doc, you ready to slice
open this bad boy?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.259
This is Dr. Rasgotra,
she's my supervisor.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.529
I just want to take
a quick listen.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.731
It's so satisfying
when you guys cut it open

24:24.731 --> 24:26.566
and all that pus
comes pouring out.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.967
Shh.
Ten blade,

24:27.967 --> 24:31.704
saline, swabs,
packing gauze,

24:31.704 --> 24:33.640
anything else?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.208
Mister...
Uh, Kingsley.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.110
We'll be back
in a minute, okay?

24:44.250 --> 24:45.952
Did you listen
to his heart?

24:45.952 --> 24:47.620
Of course I did.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.922
So when you said his exam
was entirely normal,

24:49.922 --> 24:51.758
were you just forgetting
to mention his murmur?

24:51.758 --> 24:53.760
He has a murmur?

24:53.760 --> 24:57.063
Four over six at
the left sternal border.
Has a thrill, not subtle.

24:57.063 --> 25:00.733
Wow, big miss.
I'll listen again.

25:00.733 --> 25:04.571
You can't miss a murmur
in an I.V. drug user.
Could be endocarditis.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.206
He needs an echo and antibiotics
before the I and D.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.841
I heard you were smart,

25:08.841 --> 25:12.311
but I had no idea you were
such an awesome teacher.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.881
Thanks for saving my ass.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.160
( screaming )

26:05.898 --> 26:07.967
What was that?

26:10.837 --> 26:12.004
I don't know.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.777
( door beeping )

26:20.980 --> 26:23.650
( panting )

26:24.817 --> 26:25.985
Oh, God.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.654
( panting )

26:35.695 --> 26:36.896
Wait here.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.203
What is it?

26:44.203 --> 26:45.672
A deer, I think.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.809
Is it dead?

26:49.809 --> 26:53.245
No, I...
( motor revving )

26:53.245 --> 26:55.214
I don't think so.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.718
What do we do?

26:58.718 --> 26:59.719
I don't know.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.255
MAN:
You folks need help?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.792
I didn't, uh, I didn't...
I didn't see it.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.993
Antelope.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.128
Did a real number
to your car.

27:11.263 --> 27:12.965
You both all right?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.967
Yeah.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.203
I got a rifle
in the truck.

27:25.812 --> 27:26.846
Sam?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.781
We got to keep going.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.049
Sam, the car's wrecked.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.283
The radiator is leaking.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.419
( door beeping )

27:33.419 --> 27:34.721
The windshield
is shattered.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.155
You won't be
able to see.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.826
Come on.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.193
Come on! God!

27:41.193 --> 27:43.429
( gunshot )

27:43.429 --> 27:44.731
( gun cocks )

28:00.479 --> 28:02.481
Our syphilis guy's
had over 50 partners

28:02.481 --> 28:06.352
in the last 90 days.
Wants to know if they can
come here for treatment.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.022
As long as they wait
until sunrise. Pen G, 2.4
million units, IM.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.425
Neela! Your COPD'er isn't
looking so good.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.995
Sats dropped to 87 on room air.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.830
( pants ):
I can hardly catch my breath.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.266
He was fine when I saw him,
wasn't even wheezing.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.301
You can't wheeze
if you're not moving air.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.136
We're gonna give you
some medicine to help.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.773
Albuterol, five migs
with 500 of atrovent.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.408
Sure that's a good idea?
His theophylline's 53,
and he's throwing PVC's.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.310
What?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.479
You didn't bother mentioning
a toxic theophylline level?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.848
I didn't know.
I hadn't checked.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.084
I didn't think we'd
have the level back
until tomorrow.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.819
CANBERRA:
My breathing's been bad.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.822
I took some extra pills.

28:42.822 --> 28:46.292
100 of lidocaine and move him
to trauma. And hold off
on the Albuterol

28:46.292 --> 28:48.160
until we stabilize
his arrhythmia.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.796
You got it.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.798
We'll be right back,
Mr. Canberra.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.838
You were great in there.
You really took control.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.239
Teddy, listen.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.041
I'm sorry about the
theophylline thing.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.812
I'll have to thank
Chuny for...
Just listen, okay?

29:05.812 --> 29:07.346
You want to know a secret?

29:07.346 --> 29:10.416
You don't have to be that smart
to be a good doctor.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.085
You just have to be thorough,
systematic and meticulous.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.854
I'm trying.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.223
Not hard enough. You've missed
glaring physical findings,

29:17.223 --> 29:18.858
overlooked critical labs,

29:18.858 --> 29:22.895
and I've been correcting
your med orders all night.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.063
It's my first shift.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.397
I realize that,

29:25.397 --> 29:27.934
but you're responsible
for real people here,

29:27.934 --> 29:30.269
and I can't watch
your every move.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.071
I know that.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.340
And I want to thank you.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.043
And your attitude...

29:37.043 --> 29:39.078
It's just so...

29:39.078 --> 29:42.048
contrite and appreciative.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.886
It's just weird.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.862
I...

29:55.862 --> 29:57.496
I guess I just don't get it.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.165
Wait.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.200
I'm going to get some coffee.
Need anything?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.935
Teddy, wait!

30:02.935 --> 30:06.005
We'll do a head-to-toe
H and P together.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.440
It might help identify where
some of your deficiencies are.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.448
Bollocks.

30:29.495 --> 30:33.232
They're gonna send a truck
to tow the car in.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.267
Did you call Chicago?

30:41.974 --> 30:44.010
The guy inside
gets off at 7:00.

30:44.010 --> 30:47.313
Offered us a ride back
to North Platte.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.417
From there we can
catch a bus to Denver,
or maybe rent a car.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.952
North Platte's an hour east?

31:03.129 --> 31:05.331
What are you doing?

31:07.433 --> 31:09.101
( sighs )

31:09.101 --> 31:11.003
Sam!

31:13.339 --> 31:15.507
Sam!

31:15.507 --> 31:16.575
( truck approaching )

31:16.575 --> 31:20.646
Sam!

31:20.646 --> 31:23.515
What are you doing?
What does it look
like I'm doing?

31:23.515 --> 31:25.251
You're going
to hitchhike?

31:25.251 --> 31:27.486
He's been off his insulin
for two days, Luka!

31:27.486 --> 31:28.554
He's out there dying.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.959
Hey!

31:32.959 --> 31:35.161
How'd it go?
Not well.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.196
Will you take a look
at this board?

31:37.196 --> 31:40.032
Not even 8:00,
and the day sucks.
Good morning,
Pratt.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.467
Neela, you should
have called me.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.502
Hate leaving a mess
for the day shift.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.972
Most of them are waiting
down here for beds.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.407
This is ridiculous. Antifreeze
overdose has been here

31:48.407 --> 31:50.176
since yesterday morning.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.244
Case in point.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.013
What have you been doing?

31:54.013 --> 31:56.615
Taking a bubble bath
and eating bonbons.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.451
Lewis is going to make
you run the board.
I know.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.552
Just remember
that fomepizole's

32:00.552 --> 32:02.721
an alcohol dehydrogenase
inhibitor.

32:02.721 --> 32:05.357
( snaps ):
Hey, come on, come on.
Present this thing already.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.425
Okay.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.060
Let's get the night shift home.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.495
You are...?
Lana Clemons,
new intern.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.263
You've met Dr. Sackowitz.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.499
Pratt's the senior and
Dr. Lewis is our attending.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.067
Neela, where's your intern?

32:15.067 --> 32:17.169
Sent him home a bit early.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.306
Okay, day shift, let's go.
Curtain number one.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.008
22-year-old with
myelomenigocoele.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.609
What is that?
Spina bifida?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.345
Excellent. The most common
congenital neurologic deficit,

32:26.345 --> 32:28.614
compatible with life.
How does it happen?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.449
SACKOWITZ:
Neural tube doesn't
close in utero.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.551
Most likely due
to an interaction of genetic

32:32.551 --> 32:34.020
and environmental factors.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.687
Ladies, remember
to take your folate.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.723
Okay, on to why
the patient is here.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.691
Rule out shunt obstruction--
common ER complaint--

32:39.691 --> 32:41.460
what's your approach?
Shunt series?

32:41.460 --> 32:44.063
Before that?
Tap the reservoir.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.631
Guys...

32:45.631 --> 32:47.699
before you do anything?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.735
Take a history.

32:49.735 --> 32:50.702
Classic symptoms

32:50.702 --> 32:51.537
of shunt obstruction:

32:51.537 --> 32:52.604
headache, nausea,

32:52.604 --> 32:54.040
vomiting, lethargy.

33:01.580 --> 33:06.352
I'm like a bad trailer park
version of myself.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.195
What are you
doing here, Luka?

33:19.631 --> 33:21.733
Sam, I care about Alex.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.671
But you can't
replace his father.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.506
I know that.

33:29.175 --> 33:33.379
Just not ready for this to be
all there is in my life.

33:37.483 --> 33:41.087
I can't bring
your kids back.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.155
I have a child
of my own,

33:43.155 --> 33:45.824
and if it's a choice
between you and Alex,

33:45.824 --> 33:48.194
I am always going
to choose Alex.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.795
I'm not asking you to choose.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.797
Of course you are.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.202
I don't want
what happened to my family

33:56.202 --> 34:01.107
to be the end of my story.

34:01.107 --> 34:04.176
I was a good father.
I can be a good father again.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.179
What if it's not what I want?

34:07.179 --> 34:08.679
Why...

34:08.679 --> 34:11.117
Why don't you want
to have children with me?

34:11.117 --> 34:14.585
It's not about you.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.788
I don't want to have
any more kids.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.259
I'm done.

34:20.259 --> 34:23.395
I want my life back.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.710
Oh, they can stop the run, but
the secondary's kind of suspect,

34:39.710 --> 34:41.612
champ or no champ.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.882
I tell you what,
they make the playoffs again,

34:43.882 --> 34:46.152
Colts'll eat them up.
My brother and I

34:46.152 --> 34:47.753
got tickets in
a couple of weeks.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.688
Raiders.
( chuckles )

34:49.688 --> 34:52.158
Should be able to beat up
on those jokers.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.458
What's this idiot doing?

34:55.561 --> 34:57.163
You want to ticket him?

34:58.664 --> 35:00.332
Hang on, I'll be right back.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.501
What do you got?

35:14.480 --> 35:16.915
Alex Taggart?

35:16.915 --> 35:20.252
Hey, Alex?
Are you Alex Taggart?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.814
( gasping )

35:59.358 --> 36:01.493
I'm Samantha Taggart.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.694
Dr. Collins.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.363
How is he?

36:04.363 --> 36:06.898
He was lethargic when
they brought him in here.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.767
Glucose was 375.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.237
That's not too critical.

36:11.237 --> 36:14.606
After a little insulin and
saline, he's doing much better.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.309
( sniffles )

36:17.309 --> 36:19.511
Can you give us
a minute, please?

36:24.883 --> 36:27.419
Damn it, Alex.

36:27.419 --> 36:30.256
I'm okay. I drank
lots of water.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.457
You were lucky.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.325
I know how to
monitor my sugar.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.760
You're 12 years old
and diabetic.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.762
What the hell
are you thinking?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.404
I couldn't find him.

36:45.971 --> 36:49.007
What?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.809
Dad.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.744
I looked in
the phone books.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.615
I called information,
a bunch of different
rafting companies.

36:56.615 --> 36:59.418
He's not here.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.920
Come here.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.530
ABBY:
How we doing?

37:11.530 --> 37:14.466
We're losing the battle
and we're knee-deep in triage.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.535
Well, I'm going
as fast as I can.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.937
Yeah, more than I can say
for your interns.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.972
Well, say no more.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.742
Dr. Sackowitz.
Four-centimeter
scalp lac.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.944
After copious
irrigation,

37:25.944 --> 37:28.480
I'm using a 4-0
nylon interrupted.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.616
The wound's edges
are evert...

37:30.616 --> 37:34.353
Abby?
Cosmetic repair is not
an issue with the scalp.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.821
I've never used
a skin stapler.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.856
You'll will next time.
Just point and shoot.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.825
grab another
two patients.
Dr. Lockhart,

37:39.825 --> 37:42.661
there's a guy with
abdominal pain in
a lot of distress.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.696
I sent off a CBC, Chem 20, uh,

37:44.696 --> 37:47.966
I ordered an abdominal series
and a surgical consult.
Hello.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.768
George, how are you feeling?

37:49.768 --> 37:50.902
I can't get comfortable.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.904
Okay, tell me...

37:52.904 --> 37:55.407
does it feel worse
when I do this?
( shrieks )

37:55.407 --> 37:56.708
Okay.
( groans )

37:56.708 --> 37:58.544
All right,
you have a kidney stone.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.946
How'd you know that?
I... just do.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.080
Four plus blood.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.416
30 I.V. toradol,
and ten of MS.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.486
Get a CT urogram and cancel
all the other orders.
Got it.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.721
Ten minutes,
you'll be feeling no pain.
Thank you.

38:09.721 --> 38:12.358
Should I wait and see
if the analgesics take effect?

38:12.358 --> 38:14.460
No, you should pick up
another chart.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.643
Are you sure?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.844
'Cause you
don't have to.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.790
I'm sorry, Alex.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.060
I wish that this
wasn't your life.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.632
I can't tell you
how much I wish that.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.137
It's okay, Mom.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.440
I want to go.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.859
Here?

39:20.859 --> 39:21.893
Here?

39:21.893 --> 39:22.928
How about here?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.430
Ah!

39:24.430 --> 39:25.997
Three cc's, one
percent lidocaine.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.433
Lidocaine?

39:27.433 --> 39:29.668
You have a knot
in your muscle,

39:29.668 --> 39:31.102
which this shot
should help.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.571
( gasps ):
Ah!
Okay.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.607
All right...
I'll be right back.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.008
Okay.

39:37.008 --> 39:40.011
Uh, right lower quadrant
tenderness, low-grade fever,

39:40.011 --> 39:42.848
no white count,
anorexia or rebound.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.483
Can you stand up for me?

39:44.483 --> 39:45.584
Is it appendicitis?

39:45.584 --> 39:47.653
I'll tell you
in a minute.

39:47.653 --> 39:49.588
Okay.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.490
Can you do this?

39:51.490 --> 39:54.526
Yeah.
Let's see.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.728
Can you do
it again?

39:56.728 --> 39:57.963
( laughs )

39:57.963 --> 39:59.831
Okay, excellent.
It's not an appy.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.667
Clear liquids,
recheck in the a.m.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.535
How's your headache?
Completely gone.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.136
Thank you, Doctor.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.706
I'm about to clear
the rack.
Oh, yeah?

40:07.706 --> 40:10.542
If I saw all the patients
myself, we wouldn't get behind.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.445
Bet you're feeling
pretty good about that.
Mm-hmm.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.982
I can't believe it took me
so long to figure it out.
You haven't.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.584
What?

40:18.584 --> 40:20.519
You didn't show Sackowitz
how to staple.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.954
You didn't teach Clemons about
your approach to kidney stones.

40:22.954 --> 40:26.024
You did a trigger point,
a jump test, and
ignored your interns.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.894
They were moving
slow you told me
to step it up.

40:28.894 --> 40:32.564
But your job isn't to just
move the meat, Abby,
you're a resident now.

40:32.564 --> 40:35.501
Um, the lady in exam three
spiked to 104.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.872
Guess I better go.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.642
Nice job on the board, Abby.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.177
What's the matter
with her?
She's a new R2.

40:46.177 --> 40:49.047
It's gonna be
a long year.
She'll catch on.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.550
But she's not supervising,
she's not teaching,

40:51.550 --> 40:53.084
and she's doing
everything herself.

40:53.084 --> 40:56.021
You know, that reminds me
of someone I used to know.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.942
How is he?

41:16.942 --> 41:18.910
Full of crap,
like always.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.046
I meant Alex.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.650
He's okay.

41:24.650 --> 41:28.253
He wants to spend
some time alone
with his dad, so...

41:28.253 --> 41:30.589
It's only ten more minutes
of visiting hours.

41:30.589 --> 41:35.293
So... I figure Steve
can't screw him up that
bad in ten minutes.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.295
God knows, I'm
sure he'll try.

41:37.295 --> 41:40.065
Alex is a good kid,
he'll figure it out.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.967
Damn it, that bastard.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.935
He couldn't care
less about us.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.837
But that little boy
loves him anyway.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.806
What the hell is
right about that?

41:59.685 --> 42:01.853
Thank you.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.188
For what?

42:04.923 --> 42:06.958
Coming.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.896
( sighs )

42:14.633 --> 42:16.001
Now what?

42:21.339 --> 42:23.074
Home, I guess.
I don't...

42:23.074 --> 42:25.677
Luka, you cannot
possibly want this
for your life.

42:25.677 --> 42:26.878
Want what?

42:26.878 --> 42:30.115
This. This mess.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.751
Isn't that something
I get to decide for myself?

42:34.953 --> 42:36.354
No.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.990
If it were just me...

42:38.990 --> 42:40.692
maybe.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.936
I better go in
and check on him.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.114
Steve's in prison.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.952
You don't have
to run anymore.

43:10.055 --> 43:12.090
I'm not running.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.328
I just don't want what you want.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.839
