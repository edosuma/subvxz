WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.202
Only on Fox.

00:03.904 --> 00:05.706
Narrator:
Tonight on "MasterChef"...

00:05.739 --> 00:10.811
The Thomas fire ravaged
Ventura County.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.746
Today, you're gonna be cooking

00:12.780 --> 00:15.916
for the amazing men and women
who battled that fire.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.151
...when the top eight serve
America's finest...

00:18.185 --> 00:21.221
These are some of the
most important guests
that we have ever served.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.557
This is a joke.
It looks disgusting.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.925
...things backfire.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.827
You can't expect us
to taste this.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.696
It's still raw.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.264
Get a grip or I will cook
this lunch on my own,

00:31.298 --> 00:33.100
and I'll send you four home.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.608
( music playing )

00:45.746 --> 00:47.280
Gerron:
I know we're gonna be cooking

00:47.314 --> 00:49.116
with some fresh ingredients
today.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.784
( laughter )

00:50.818 --> 00:54.021
What I'm looking at right now
is beautiful!

00:54.054 --> 00:57.224
Back home in Louisville,
Kentucky, I'm a teacher.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.628
It's not every day I get to see
palm trees everywhere.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.063
There are large mountains,
there are animals,

01:03.096 --> 01:05.098
there are lemon trees
and orange trees.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.900
I'm loving every minute of it.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.136
I think the kitchen's on
the top of the mountain, y'all.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.575
- Wow!
- Look at this view!

01:15.609 --> 01:17.277
If this is what it's like
to be in the top eight,

01:17.310 --> 01:20.047
I cannot wait to get
to the top five.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.582
I'm the king of the world!

01:22.616 --> 01:25.218
Right now Team Aarón
has three aprons,

01:25.252 --> 01:27.320
Gordon is finally down
to three,

01:27.354 --> 01:30.090
but Team Joe,
we're down to two.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.793
We cannot afford to lose
anybody else, period.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.829
( horn blaring )

01:38.098 --> 01:40.000
Oh, my gosh, y'all,
look at the fire truck!

01:44.838 --> 01:46.807
- Appreciate it, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.075
Oh, my God!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.743
The judges have come out
of a plane,

01:49.777 --> 01:52.112
they've come out of forklifts.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.147
The fire truck-- I'm not
surprised they have one
in their garage,

01:54.181 --> 01:56.083
but what does this mean?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.185
Are you just anticipating
we're gonna create a fire

01:58.218 --> 02:00.888
and you wanna be sure
that you have the capabilities
to put it out?

02:02.690 --> 02:06.960
Welcome to Peterson Ranch
and your next team challenge.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.996
- Wow.
- Come on, guys.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.931
Tell me this is not
the most beautiful place
you've ever seen.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.166
- It is beautiful!
- Outstanding.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.937
But all of this was threatened
when the Thomas fires broke out

02:16.970 --> 02:18.038
this past December.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.140
Wow!

02:20.173 --> 02:25.612
Joe: The Thomas fire burned
over 281,000 acres

02:25.645 --> 02:27.114
over five weeks.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.816
The smoke produced was
so massive,

02:28.849 --> 02:31.051
it could be seen
from outer space.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.188
And today you are going
to be cooking

02:35.222 --> 02:40.160
for 25 amazing men and women
who fought that fire.

02:40.193 --> 02:41.862
Samantha:
I am incredibly honored.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.663
I lived in Southern California
for a while.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.198
When we lived here
there was a big wildfire

02:45.232 --> 02:47.067
and we had to evacuate
from our homes,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.369
but because of firefighting
men and women,

02:49.402 --> 02:52.505
like those that we're serving
today, our house was saved.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.976
Now, Bowen and Cesar,
you guys won

02:56.009 --> 02:57.878
that incredible tag team
challenge.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.381
Both of you will be
team captains today.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.383
Bowen:
This is amazing.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.985
Being a team captain.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.154
Let's go, Cesar, Bowen.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.557
I've been captain once
in the first team challenge,

03:10.590 --> 03:12.692
and I lead my team
to be success.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.162
My strategy is simple.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.496
Just kick his ass.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.598
All right, I want you six

03:18.631 --> 03:21.234
to break yourselves
into two teams of three.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.770
Right now.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.173
Y'all really gonna
huddle up like that?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.208
I'm good.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.010
I'm going with Farhan
and Julia.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.578
I don't even have to move.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.046
Farhan is spice boy.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.047
He knows his spices.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.715
He knows how to cook.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.218
Julia, she has never lost
a team challenge.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.854
This is dream team.
We got this.

03:40.888 --> 03:46.293
Eventually, each of you
captains will pair up
with one of those teams.

03:46.326 --> 03:50.097
But first, let's see what you
will be cooking today.

03:50.130 --> 03:55.702
Your choice of protein today is
between two of my favorites

03:55.735 --> 03:57.938
for special occasions.

03:57.971 --> 04:02.609
The first happens to be
the stunning rack of lamb.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.112
I mean, that's a chef's
Rolls-Royce cut.

04:05.145 --> 04:09.783
Today we're looking for a
perfect medium rare temperature.

04:09.817 --> 04:13.954
Captains, for your other
protein... sea bass!

04:13.987 --> 04:16.089
A sweet, tasty white fish

04:16.123 --> 04:19.626
that lets you know when it's
cooked by turning bright white.

04:21.294 --> 04:24.131
One of the captains will get
to choose

04:24.164 --> 04:27.968
between picking their protein
first or picking their team.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.636
- Oh.
- Ah.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.138
But first we need
to flip a coin.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.141
Heads it's Bowen,
tails it's Cesar.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.143
Bowen and Cesar:
Got it.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.184
Heads. Bowen.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.120
Are you choosing your protein
first or your team first?

04:47.154 --> 04:48.989
I wanna choose my protein.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.991
- Okay.
- Bowen: We are top eight.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.425
Everybody can cook.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.662
So, the protein is more
important than the team.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.497
Which one are you going to pick?

04:57.530 --> 04:59.332
- Sea bass.
- You're gonna pick
the sea bass.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.567
Joe:
Ooh.

05:02.369 --> 05:06.840
Cesar, which of these two teams
will you be working with today?

05:06.874 --> 05:09.209
I'll go with Julia,
Farhan, and Gerron.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.777
Joe:
Okay.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.946
Captains, team aprons.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.982
Cesar:
For me, this is an easy choice.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.285
You got Farhan, amazing
with spices and seasoning.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.288
You got Gerron, fellow educator
who works from the heart.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.190
It matches my shirt.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.993
And Julia and I have been
in two other team challenges.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.527
We won them both.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.862
We're not a team
to be taken lightly.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.297
Gordon:
Aprons on, please.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.798
Ashley:
I'm looking at our red team.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.700
Shanika and Samantha can cook,

05:33.733 --> 05:36.169
but I have been on a team
with Bowen as my captain.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.805
He gets frazzled
and loses his mind.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.809
Hopefully,
we don't go down in flames.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.879
Okay, red team, blue team,
you will have just 60 minutes

05:45.913 --> 05:51.051
to conceive, prep, cook,
and serve 25 perfect plates

05:51.084 --> 05:54.154
for these elite firefighters.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.990
Every one of these firefighters
will vote at the end of lunch

05:57.024 --> 05:59.759
by ringing a team colored
fire bell.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.029
The team with the most votes
will win this challenge.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.098
- Yes.
- These are some of the most
important guests

06:05.132 --> 06:07.935
that we have ever cooked for
in "MasterChef."

06:07.968 --> 06:10.237
- Absolutely.
- So after 30 minutes,

06:10.270 --> 06:13.073
we are gonna taste your dish
and give you some feedback.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.874
Home cooks:
Yes, Chef.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.944
Okay, teams, are you ready?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.211
Home cooks:
Yes.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.914
Your time starts...

06:24.084 --> 06:25.752
...now!

06:25.785 --> 06:28.021
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Go, go, go, go!

06:28.055 --> 06:30.723
- Cesar: Hustle, hustle.
- Samantha: Come on,
we got this, guys.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.260
All right, guys,
I think what we should do
roasted rack of lamb.

06:33.293 --> 06:34.962
- Okay.
- With couscous and a pea puree.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.229
- Yeah.
- What are you thinking
for the lamb?

06:36.263 --> 06:37.864
I know you're an expert
on lamb.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.066
How you gonna handle
the fat cap?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.300
Render it in the pan.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.269
I eat lamb all the time.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.703
My dad's a halal butcher.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.872
He slaughters 200 lambs a week.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.142
I've never had to cook
25 lamb racks in an hour,

06:49.176 --> 06:51.278
but it's a challenge
I'm willing to take on.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.779
- All right, blue team.
- Let's go.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.814
- One, two, three.
- All: Blue team!

06:56.683 --> 06:59.319
I'm thinking about to make
a pan-seared sea bass

06:59.352 --> 07:01.654
- with roast baby carrots...
- Okay.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.957
- ...cauliflower puree.
- White or purple? Which one--

07:03.991 --> 07:05.625
- Purple. And the--
- Okay.

07:05.658 --> 07:06.793
- I really like the carrots.
- Okay.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.795
Go, go, go, go, go!

07:08.828 --> 07:11.131
Ashley:
I'm pleasantly surprised
by Bowen right now.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.732
Shanika, use salt
and pepper.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.734
- Okay.
- Just really simple.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.336
He seems confident,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.905
and that makes me confident
for our team.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.740
As long as we stay focused
we can pull it together,

07:20.773 --> 07:22.142
and this will be
a beautiful dish.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.177
Come on, guys.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.779
Guys, we're down
to the top eight.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.181
There's four on each team.
Come on.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.949
I'm expecting great things
today.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.519
Bowen won the coin toss
and he chose the sea bass.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.921
How many portions
do we have total?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.624
- We're prepping 26.
- I think it was a foolish,
foolish decision

07:37.657 --> 07:39.126
to go with choosing
a protein first.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.294
You have to choose
your team first,

07:41.328 --> 07:43.830
because those are the people
who are gonna affect the quality
of the dish.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.965
I disagree, Joe.
It depends on how strong
a captain you are.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.135
- I want you do this way.
- Gotcha.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.037
Gordon:
If you delegate strong enough,
your team will follow.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.040
- Bowen: Shanika, you all right?
- Yes, sir.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.308
Cesar was relegated
to the rack of lamb.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.144
It's a showstopper.
You can do so many different
things with it.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.179
A crust would be ideal.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.880
I'm toasting almonds
for the crust.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.016
Sounds good, dude.
These lamb racks are amazing.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.052
- Farhan is rendering the fat.
- He's rendering 'em.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.220
That is so unforgiving.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.624
Farhan, be a little more
aggressive with the salt.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.126
I'm gonna add it
right now.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.528
I'm rendering out all the fat
currently.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.065
The difficulty about cooking
rack of lamb is handling
the fat cap.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.167
So, you know, there's two
methods you can do it.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.635
You can either slice the fat
off, make sure they cook faster,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.837
or render the fat down
and hope it melts all away,

08:24.871 --> 08:26.873
which is how I love to cook it.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.008
Work as fast as possible,
but work precise.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.711
The big risk here is it's gonna
take me a little bit of time,

08:31.744 --> 08:33.080
but I think it's gonna
be worth it.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.814
We gotta get the lamb
in the oven.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.216
First batch.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.855
- Samantha: They're here
for tasting, guys.
- We gotta move, y'all.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.158
Bowen:
Cooking the sea bass
is really hard.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.661
So I'm nervous, but as a pilot,
a little bit nervousness

08:48.695 --> 08:51.564
can cause you get good
performance.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.067
Ready, Bowen?
All four of you, let's go.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.103
Explain the dish,
please.

08:56.136 --> 09:00.173
Pan-seared sea bass
with carrots roasted
and cauliflower puree.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.075
- Who cooked the fish?
- I did.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.843
Aarón:
Skin needs more time.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.044
- Skin needs more time.
- Okay, sure.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.913
I'm nervous
a little bit.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.949
The cooking, wrong side.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.951
Skin side down
for 90% of the way.

09:11.984 --> 09:13.253
- You flip it
with two minutes to go.
- Okay.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.921
Carrots, beautifully done
and puree nice.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.257
A bit more of it so it makes
the dish more wholesome.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.025
Joe:
The components of it
are right.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.928
You need to amplify it.
It needs to be this times two.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.930
- Let's get back here.
- It's my fault.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.532
Shanika:
I think the judges
criticizing Bowen

09:25.565 --> 09:28.101
just put a dent
in his freaking confidence.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.737
We can't afford this today.

09:30.770 --> 09:31.938
Everything has to be perfect.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.606
Bowen: Shanika,
do the sea bass.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.608
You got this,
just calm down.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.146
Gordon:
Ready, Cesar?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.080
Yes, Chef,
cutting lamb right now.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.982
- Come on, please, blue team.
- Cesar: Come on, guys.

09:43.015 --> 09:46.119
All four of you, let's go.
Line up, please. Thank you.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.587
Explain the dish,
please.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.622
Roasted rack of lamb,
minted mushy peas,

09:49.656 --> 09:51.791
couscous with mushrooms
and roasted root vegetables,

09:51.824 --> 09:53.993
and then we have
the red wine demi.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.063
It looks disgusting.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.066
Guys, that's raw fat.
That's just a visual, okay?

10:00.099 --> 10:02.302
You're not even close.
This lamb is ten minutes away

10:02.335 --> 10:05.605
in an oven at 350 being
anything near to being done.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.808
We have half an hour
to get this out.
Come on, guys.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.109
Joe:
You can't expect us
to taste this.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
Gordon:
There's no freaking way!

10:18.385 --> 10:21.087
- Come on, guys.
- Joe: You can't expect us
to taste this.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.589
Gordon:
There's no freaking way!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.157
Figure this out now.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.092
This is not a dish you would
present to anyone important.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.694
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

10:27.727 --> 10:29.095
Julia: I can't believe
our lamb is raw.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.763
Like seriously, Farhan,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.098
that's the main star
of the dish.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.700
We're getting rid
of the fat caps.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.168
That's gonna take
more time, guys.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.036
No, it's gonna cut
our sear time down.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.105
But we're adding another step
is what I'm saying, though.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.107
Yeah, but it's faster
than rendering it down.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.109
Julia:
Farhan says that he knows
how to do it.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.544
I don't think
that he'd lie about it,

10:44.577 --> 10:46.213
because he knows
how serious it is,

10:46.246 --> 10:49.115
but I'm not just gonna
take his word for it.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.950
I'm definitely gonna check up
on Farhan with this lamb.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.320
Speed it up.
It looked horrible.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.992
- Gordon: Speed up, red team.
- Ashley and Samantha:
Heard, Chef.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.961
I need somebody like to clean
the station for me.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.863
I'm trying to clean,
Bowen.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.033
I said get the pans hot and then
who filled them up with oil?

11:07.066 --> 11:09.035
( bleep ) no.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.703
- When do you put the oil in?
- When you're ready to cook.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.005
Thank you.
Can you tell him, please?

11:13.039 --> 11:15.508
- Yes. Yeah.
- Don't put the oil until you're
ready to put the fish on.

11:15.542 --> 11:18.745
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.046
Is there any oil
in these pans?

11:20.079 --> 11:21.914
Oh, guys, come on.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.817
We have 26 minutes

11:24.851 --> 11:26.719
- to get 25 plates on there.
- Heard, Chef.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.855
Three minutes from now,
bus in.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.391
Two minutes before the bus
comes out, you flip it,
cook the other side.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.060
Butter in. Don't put
the butter in too early,
'cause you'll burn the butter.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.029
- As a captain, get a grip!
- Okay, sure, Chef.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.232
I love Bowen, but he's getting
a little frazzled.

11:39.266 --> 11:43.069
Somebody has to step in and help
put this fire out right now.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.038
- I'm gonna help cook
in the back. We got this.
- Okay.

11:55.815 --> 11:58.184
- ( horn honking )
- Red team, blue team.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.853
- Julia and Farhan: Yes, Chef.
- Our esteemed guests
are arriving.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.889
Let's go.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.893
Cesar:
All right, guys,
we really gotta hustle now.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.194
Farhan:
Let's do this.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.762
Get your pans hot, Bowen.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.897
Get ready to sear
that fish.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.465
Yes, yes, Chef.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.867
I'm Alison Hesterly,
fire captain.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.605
I am so excited to see what
the chefs have prepared for us.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.206
I think we're all looking
forward to it.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.809
Bowen, we got the skin side down
for 90% of the time.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.311
- Got it.
- I'm Mike Dubron.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.479
I'm with the Los Angeles County
Fire Department.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.881
I've been a firefighter
for 27 years,

12:28.915 --> 12:31.918
and we're expecting
a really nice dinner tonight.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.220
Hopefully we're able
to enjoy a meal

12:34.253 --> 12:36.789
versus the chaotic scene
we saw just a few months ago.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.825
Hot plates going in.
First batch is in the oven.

12:38.858 --> 12:41.728
- Okay. Come on, guys.
- These ( bleep ) are hot.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.597
Hey, FYI, anyone complains
about being hot here,
I'm gonna kick their ass.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.901
Welcome, welcome, everyone.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.637
Hi. I'm Joe.
Nice to see everyone.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.006
I just wanted to say thank you
for all you do,

12:54.040 --> 12:56.008
and for what you did
for California

12:56.042 --> 12:57.977
during the Thomas fire.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.080
Please enjoy some canapés
and lunch will be served
momentarily.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.049
Thank you for coming.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.989
- So, Farhan, all the lambs
in the oven?
- No.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.424
We still need to finish
crusting. We have half
the lamb ready, Chef.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.159
All right, so let's go, guys.
Come on.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.127
Is that the last of the 25
that you guys are crusting up?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.930
- Yes.
- Gerron, do you have enough
herbs in there?

13:17.964 --> 13:20.700
- Yeah.
- I'll be honest, it looks
a little skimpy on the herbs.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.268
Just don't put something on
to put it on.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.103
- Okay, Chef.
- Make sure it's consistent.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.972
What do you need?
Do you need lemon zest?
I got you.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.207
- Cesar: You got herbs,
you got thyme.
- I got the tarragon.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.644
Cesar:
Every component of the dish has
to be firing at all cylinders

13:31.678 --> 13:33.713
just to meet the expectations.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.615
This is fine dining.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.984
It's a struggle and a daunting
task to be put up against.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.052
There we go.
That looks better.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.889
Let's do this,
you guys.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.725
Bowen, stay focused.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.494
Gordon:
15 minutes.
We need to go.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.961
- Let's go.
- Almost ready.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.698
Check the color.
Crispy skin, beautifully done.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.032
- See how crispy that is?
- Yeah.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.034
Good girl.
There you go.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.135
Oh, Bowen.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.471
Why'd you put the butter in?

13:58.505 --> 14:02.208
I said two minutes
before the bass comes out,
butter goes in,

14:02.241 --> 14:05.011
and he's put the butter
in already.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.979
You're just not listening
to anything.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.548
Butter goes in last.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.717
'cause it burns!

14:10.750 --> 14:12.485
- Sorry, Chef.
- You can say sorry
all you want.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.220
- This is important for me.
- I know it's important.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.988
- Give me your apron,
I'll wear it.
- No.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.659
- Shanika: Come on, Bowen.
- Honestly, this is a joke.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.093
( bleep ) hell, man.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.037
Gordon:
Butter goes in last...

14:31.070 --> 14:32.905
- Okay. I remember.
- ..'cause it burns.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.907
- Sorry, Chef.
- Everybody here is trying
to help you,

14:34.941 --> 14:36.576
but you're just ignoring
the help.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.778
No, Chef, I will--
I will get help.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.879
- Shanika.
- Yes, Chef.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.581
Can you take over the bass?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.049
- Gotcha, Chef.
- Gordon: Yes?

14:43.082 --> 14:45.452
Pass all the bass to her
and you start plating now.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.455
Now Gordon is relying on me
to get all of this fish done.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.789
Take control, young lady.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.691
We need resting racks
for this fish.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.926
Part of me is appreciating
that Gordon believes in me,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.796
then a part of me is like I'm
in charge of the protein now.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.032
If this ship goes down, I'm
gonna be like one of the heads

15:00.066 --> 15:02.034
that's gonna get rolled
because of this.

15:02.068 --> 15:06.773
( clicks tongue )
This is not what I signed up
for today.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.641
Farhan, let's go with that lamb.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.943
- All right.
Hey, we're slicing here.
- Yeah.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.812
Farhan:
Plating's starting and my only
thought process is,

15:12.845 --> 15:14.881
if I didn't get
this lamb right,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.816
it's like I'm leading
the blue team to slaughter.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.885
- Where's your tray
to put the lamb on?
- ( bleep )!

15:18.918 --> 15:20.953
Come on, Farhan.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.789
Julia:
The couscous is done,
pea puree is finished,

15:22.822 --> 15:25.825
but the lamb is the star
of the dish.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.728
I wanna make sure
that this is cooked perfect.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.729
Farhan, come on.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.297
Show me what
these look like.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.565
Cesar, you just want it
down the middle, right?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.900
Yup.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.101
Nice, okay.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.003
Julia:
Pretty good.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.071
- Cesar: Yeah, that's nice.
- Beautifully cooked.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.940
- Gordon: Get ready to sauce,
please.
- Gotcha, Chef.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.610
Farhan: I nailed it.
It's a beautiful medium rare.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.678
All my lamb drama
finally paid off!

15:45.712 --> 15:47.246
- Oh, perfect.
- Don't shout perfect now,
young man.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.782
We haven't ( bleep )
served anything yet.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.584
- Let's celebrate when we got
something to celebrate.
- Julia: Yes, Chef.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.952
Samantha:
Any fish ready?

15:52.985 --> 15:54.954
Give it one minute.
Okay?

15:54.987 --> 15:56.422
- Okay!
- I'm just letting you know.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.457
- All right.
- Calm down.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.760
Everyone on the team is
cracking under pressure
right now.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.128
But if I get this
sea bass right,

16:02.161 --> 16:04.764
we still have a chance
at winning.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.868
I want the most beautiful
25 pieces of fish you have.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.137
- Aarón: Let's go.
- Julia: Hurry up,
the servers are coming, guys.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.172
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.974
Two minutes to get
these plates out.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.876
- How long for the bass,
please, Shanika?
- One minute, Chef.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.477
- One minute.
- One minute. Thank God
you're here, you lady.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.980
Shanika is busting out sea bass.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.549
We got enough fish.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.518
She is handling her station
like a freaking pro.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.987
Gordon:
90 seconds we start serving.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.991
Guys, one minute left.
Let's go.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.126
- We're good?
- Gerron: It's time
to be picky now, y'all.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.062
Make sure everything is good.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.864
Get the bass on the plate,
guys, get the bass
on the plate.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.232
You, get the bass on the plate.
You're still missing two.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.134
- Shanika: Less than 30 seconds.
- Bowen: Okay.

16:42.168 --> 16:46.005
Put it on there,
get these microgreens on
this damn plate. Move.

16:46.038 --> 16:47.707
- It's 25. You are good.
- Gordon: Time up.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.175
Serve. Cloches on.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.979
Service, please, pick up.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.915
Bowen:
Today I was bad team leader

16:55.948 --> 16:57.817
because I didn't cook the fish
properly.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.586
But the firefighters
didn't see that.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.020
Be gentle.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.422
The only thing they see
is our dish,

17:03.455 --> 17:06.525
and we put everything together
on the plate.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.828
Shanika:
The dish looked good.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.929
Cesar:
They're ready to grab just
from the bottom.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.764
Thank you, guys.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.766
We're looking down at 25

17:13.800 --> 17:15.935
perfectly cooked
medium rare racks of lamb.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.837
We don't wanna celebrate
too early,

17:17.870 --> 17:20.006
but we're giving silent
fist bumps to each other,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.574
and I'm proud of the dish

17:21.608 --> 17:23.876
that we're sending
to our 25 esteemed guests.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.745
Hello, everybody.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.180
In front of you, you each have
a dish from the red team,

17:28.214 --> 17:29.616
and a dish from the blue team.

17:29.649 --> 17:33.119
The red team has served...

17:33.152 --> 17:35.454
pan-seared sea bass

17:35.487 --> 17:37.890
with roasted baby carrots,
cauliflower puree

17:37.924 --> 17:39.992
and a citrus herb vinaigrette.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.196
The blue team has served...

17:44.230 --> 17:46.799
crusted rack of American lamb,

17:46.833 --> 17:51.370
pea-mint puree, couscous,
and a red wine demi sauce.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.506
Buon appetito.
Enjoy.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.946
It's judgment time.
We could've did better.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.981
I don't think we worked well
as a team,

18:02.014 --> 18:05.752
but the flavors are there
and it looks beautiful.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.754
- For you, sir?
- Both of them are really good.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.555
I think the blue team
did a really nice job.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.825
The rack of lamb is tender, but
I have to say that the red team

18:12.859 --> 18:14.761
did probably the best sea bass
I've ever had.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.995
- For you, sir?
- Red team.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.630
I like the texture,
I like the skin.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.965
It's crunchy.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.599
That food gonna come
through, y'all.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.134
It was flavorful.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.103
- For you, sir?
- The blue team, rack of lamb.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.572
- Rack of lamb.
- In all my 34 years
of firefighting,

18:26.605 --> 18:28.140
I've never had a rack of lamb
this good.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.476
- What do you think?
- My preference is the lamb.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.444
Blue team. Every bite is
just filled with flavor,

18:32.478 --> 18:33.913
and it goes really well
with the, um--

18:33.946 --> 18:35.614
- With the minty peas.
- Minty peas, right.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.684
Great job on that cook.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.685
I think the pea puree
is pretty good.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.286
Yeah, it's awesome.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.520
- And for you, sir?
- Well, they're both fantastic.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.022
There's an invitation to both

18:43.055 --> 18:44.190
the red and blue team to come
to my firehouse.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.692
Nice. Okay.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.894
Well, now it's time to vote.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.465
- ( bell ringing )
- You guys hear them bells?

18:53.499 --> 18:54.867
Oh, yeah.
Hopefully that's for us.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.135
- Gerron: I hope so.
- Julia: Oh, my God.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.670
Ashley:
Y'all hear that?

18:57.704 --> 19:00.106
Samantha:
Oh, gosh.

19:00.139 --> 19:05.377
I got this instinct that tells
me blue bells are ringing.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.547
I know it's blue.
I'm confident that it's blue.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.952
I sure hope it's blue.
( laughs )

19:12.985 --> 19:14.721
Ashley:
There's another one,
y'all.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.823
It's another bell?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.959
- Oh, I hope those are
red team bells.
- Ashley: I know.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.527
Shanika:
Where the wood at?
Right here.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.896
Knock on wood.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.998
Ladies and gentlemen,
um, first of all,

19:26.032 --> 19:28.034
thank you for giving us
the opportunity

19:28.067 --> 19:30.002
to spoil you for once.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.840
Now, please, give a warm welcome
for our red team
and our blue team.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.507
- Thank you.
- ( applause )

19:39.511 --> 19:43.750
As you know, there can only be
one winning team,

19:43.783 --> 19:46.986
and the other team will face
the dreaded pressure test.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.822
So, without further ado,

19:49.856 --> 19:52.591
congratulations goes to...

19:55.962 --> 19:57.964
( cheering )

19:59.899 --> 20:01.067
They got it.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.102
We did it!
They loved my lamb!

20:03.135 --> 20:06.705
I had so much pressure
on my shoulders today,
but it paid off.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.107
Blue team, congratulations.
Go and say hello

20:08.140 --> 20:09.942
to our esteemed guests.
Come on.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.711
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much
for everything you do.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.214
Red team, you're gonna have to
face the dreaded pressure test.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.549
Finish up cleaning,

20:17.583 --> 20:19.852
and I'll see you back
in the MasterChef kitchen.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.587
Of course, we lost.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.957
Bowen killed our team
and I'm livid.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.193
It sucks.
All of us got our ass
rang out today.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.029
Yeah, it sucks.
I mean, Captain, you're
still not saying anything.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031
You were putting oil in pans,
you were putting butter in pans.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.934
- And then you--
- Because Shanika--
Shanika had to step up

20:34.967 --> 20:36.803
and cook perfect sea bass
for the whole team.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.806
Every ( bleep ) I made
( bleep ), and then you have--

20:39.839 --> 20:41.740
You do everything correct.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.243
So we will figure out tomorrow
pressure test. Let's go.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.825
- Welcome back.
- Shanika: I'm disappointed.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.627
We lost because we just
lacked communication.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.963
- Bowen shut down.
- Gordon: Let's go.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.899
But if there's anybody
that can handle the pressure
test, it's me.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.835
Joe, you won't lose
another apron today.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.769
I guarantee you that.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.940
Yesterday, we challenged you
to make an exquisite lunch

21:13.973 --> 21:18.010
for 25 brave men and women
who saved countless lives

21:18.044 --> 21:20.847
in the recent California
wildfires.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.316
And, sadly, for you four,
the firefighters decided

21:24.350 --> 21:27.786
that the blue team's dish
was better than yours.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.422
They won with 72% of the vote.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.791
- ( whispers ) Wow!
- ( whistles )

21:32.825 --> 21:36.863
Red team, tonight you will face
an intense pressure test,

21:36.896 --> 21:39.698
and after this pressure test,

21:39.731 --> 21:42.734
at least one home cook
will be eliminated.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.506
For your pressure test tonight,

21:47.539 --> 21:51.810
you'll be making something
that I built my career around.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.947
Tonight, to keep your place
in this competition,

21:54.981 --> 21:57.683
you will have to make...

21:57.716 --> 22:00.286
pasta.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.054
Nice.

22:02.088 --> 22:07.326
This specific pasta dish is a
perfect pappardelle Capricciosa.

22:07.359 --> 22:10.796
Ribbons of pasta with a sauce
of San Marzano tomatoes,

22:10.829 --> 22:12.965
prosciutto, and onions.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.401
Doesn't get any better
than that.

22:15.434 --> 22:17.870
In fact, I love it so much,

22:17.904 --> 22:20.772
- one pasta
is just never enough.
- No.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.746
Mezzelune filled
with a classic combination

22:27.779 --> 22:30.983
of braised Swiss chard
and ricotta cheese

22:31.017 --> 22:35.221
in a simple sauce of slightly
burnt butter with sage.

22:35.254 --> 22:38.424
These are two of my favorite
pasta dishes.

22:38.457 --> 22:43.429
The problem is
I also really love...

22:43.462 --> 22:47.699
a dish my grandmother
taught me to make.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.936
garganelli with funghi
trifolati.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.938
It's mixed sautéed mushroom

22:51.971 --> 22:54.440
with thyme, garlic,
and olive oil.

22:54.473 --> 22:58.577
And I expect you to replicate
all three.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.678
( exhales )
Of course.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.780
And to complete all three,

23:01.813 --> 23:04.483
you only get 60 minutes.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.720
So, before all of you start
cooking,

23:08.754 --> 23:11.924
Joe is gonna show you
how it's done.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.892
Watch and learn.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.461
Whoa! This is dope.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.196
Joe Bastianich,
you look up his name,

23:17.229 --> 23:19.031
there's pasta sitting
next to it.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.801
This front row seat into
Joe Bastianich master class

23:22.834 --> 23:26.738
is the best seat in the house.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.240
So we start with the dough.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.976
The dough should be worked
properly, rested.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.245
And then the next thing we have
to do here is sheet it out.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.746
You wanna get enough
thinness to it

23:34.780 --> 23:36.748
so that it's like very elastic.

23:36.782 --> 23:40.386
So we can use the same sheet
for all three shapes of pasta.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.221
First shape is pappardelle.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.923
Pappardelle ribbon pasta's
generally like an inch wide

23:44.957 --> 23:47.826
and about six to eight inches
in length.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.295
That's a perfect pappardelle.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.563
You wanna flour it again
a little bit

23:51.597 --> 23:53.332
so it doesn't stick together.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.334
About 10 to 12 pieces
in a portion.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.269
And that's our pappardelle.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.505
Next we will make mezzelune.

23:59.538 --> 24:02.574
With the stamp mold, you get
the perfect shape of pasta.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.777
It's filled with ricotta,
braised Swiss chard,
and Grana Padano.

24:05.811 --> 24:07.746
You take a little bit
of egg wash.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.848
You go around
the lower half perimeter.

24:09.881 --> 24:13.685
Push it back and then
you're gonna pinch,
pinch, pinch, pinch,

24:13.719 --> 24:14.786
pinch, pinch, pinch.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.022
Voilà.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.357
So that's the mezzelune.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.691
And last but not least,

24:19.725 --> 24:22.494
we will make the garganelli.

24:22.528 --> 24:26.365
So I'm gonna stamp out
my squares.

24:26.398 --> 24:29.968
And then carefully
push just hard enough

24:30.002 --> 24:32.771
so you get that beautiful
little shape on it.

24:32.804 --> 24:33.839
Voilà.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.776
- Wow!
- Joe: There you have it.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.812
So, pappardelle are gonna go
with a Capricciosa sauce.

24:40.846 --> 24:44.816
That's San Marzano tomatoes,
prosciutto, and onions,

24:44.850 --> 24:48.354
mezzelune in a brown butter
and sage sauce,

24:48.387 --> 24:51.657
garganelli with sautéed
mushroom, garlic, thyme,

24:51.690 --> 24:54.293
finished with Grana Padano
cheese.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.696
Three simple pastas, delicious,
but not so easy.

24:57.729 --> 24:59.665
Cooking three different types
of pastas,

24:59.698 --> 25:01.900
three different sauces
in 60 minutes--

25:01.933 --> 25:05.137
professional chefs
with decades of experience

25:05.171 --> 25:06.838
would have trouble with that,

25:06.872 --> 25:08.840
and I'm just happy
I'm not down there.

25:08.874 --> 25:11.577
At your stations, you have
everything that you need

25:11.610 --> 25:15.881
to make those three amazing
pasta dishes.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.816
Right, you four,
when the 60 minutes are up

25:17.849 --> 25:21.387
you need to have
all of your three pasta dishes

25:21.420 --> 25:22.821
placed down the front.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.690
- Is everybody ready?
- Home cooks: Yes.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.893
Your 60 minutes starts...

25:29.795 --> 25:30.796
now.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.272
Joe, you've asked them
to make three dishes.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.007
What's the most difficult one
to nail?

25:42.040 --> 25:44.943
Probably the mezzelune,
because it's a stuffed pasta.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.712
So you have the variable
of making the filling.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.714
So you have to braise
your Swiss chard,

25:48.747 --> 25:50.216
olive oil, give it flavor.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.218
You have to rinse out the water,

25:52.251 --> 25:53.952
because if you put
that Swiss chard in
wet with the ricotta,

25:53.985 --> 25:56.688
- it's gonna be a pond.
- Game over.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.590
- Whoa.
- Wow, stressing me out.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.760
So, the garganelli.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.595
The trick here is
your funghi trifolati.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.864
So, mushrooms have a lot
of moisture in them.

26:05.897 --> 26:09.235
You have to sauté them with
thyme, whole garlic cloves,

26:09.268 --> 26:11.903
and olive oil, so you render
the water out of them.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.472
Make it come to life.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.807
Aarón: All right, Joe,
so the pappardelle.

26:15.841 --> 26:18.777
What are some of the things
that they have to nail in order
to get that pasta right?

26:18.810 --> 26:20.612
So, pappardelle is perhaps
the most straightforward
of the three.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.581
They're just
ribbon-shaped pasta.

26:22.614 --> 26:23.882
You have to have
the right thickness.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.417
It has to be elastic.

26:25.451 --> 26:26.818
You have to be able to see
through it,

26:26.852 --> 26:28.754
but it has to be able
to hold its form.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.556
Not so easy.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.990
Come on.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.460
- Looks really dry.
- It looks hella dry.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.762
Guys, we've 34 minutes
remaining.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.431
- Heard, Chef.
- Sauces should be en route,

26:39.465 --> 26:42.301
and you should be starting
to roll your pasta

26:42.334 --> 26:45.171
within the next ten minutes.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.572
Let's go, Sam.
Come on, let's go.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.939
- Right, Samantha.
- Yes, Chef.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.342
How many times have you
made pasta before?

26:50.376 --> 26:52.578
I make pasta all the time
for myself, my sorority sisters.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.780
My dad loved pasta.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.782
- But you never made
three dishes in one go.
- No, I have not.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.517
So that's gonna be a bit
of a struggle.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.686
- Are you gonna nail this?
- Yes, Chef, I will nail this.

27:00.719 --> 27:03.455
The worst thing for me,
I've got three
of my pins down here.

27:03.489 --> 27:06.192
I'd be so upset if you were
to leave tonight.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.361
- Don't let me down. Good luck.
- Yes, Chef. Thank you.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.497
- Tomatoes.
- Ashley, how we doing?

27:11.530 --> 27:13.965
I have one sauce that just kinda
needs a little finishing touch.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.834
I have my mushrooms going,
my water is boiling,

27:15.867 --> 27:17.503
and I'm about to roll out
my pasta now,

27:17.536 --> 27:19.705
and I have one of the fillings
already ready as well.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.341
Do you feel that this pasta
challenge is too great
to surmount or what?

27:22.374 --> 27:24.710
Absolutely not.
I feel like for those who can't,

27:24.743 --> 27:27.379
- you know, then it's just
their time to go home.
- All right, good luck.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.315
- Farhan: Looking good, Bowen.
- Keep hustlin'.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.816
- Bowen.
- Yes, Chef.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.518
- How you feeling?
- I'm feeling good.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.886
Do me a favor.
Turn around and look.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.588
Look at the contestants.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.495
- Yup.
- You're the only one
that's got no sauce up.

27:43.529 --> 27:46.332
This is empty.
You're making a filling
for ravioli

27:46.365 --> 27:47.733
that we don't even need yet.

27:47.766 --> 27:49.568
- I will. I will.
- Young man.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.737
- Are you going home?
- No, I'm not.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.905
- I'm not going home.
- Come on, then prioritize!

27:53.939 --> 27:55.907
- Get the sauces on. Come on.
- Okay, sure, Chef.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.410
- Snap out of it.
- This is so stressful.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.712
- Does Shanika have any pasta
in the water?
- No.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.548
Okay, Shanika.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.250
This is the most stressed
I've seen you, quite frankly.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.719
- Is it the challenge or--
- Well, it's pasta three times.

28:07.753 --> 28:11.257
- It's not pasta once.
- Shanika, that's like a rock.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.724
If you don't get
this dough softer,

28:12.758 --> 28:13.825
- you could be going home today.
- All right.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.362
That's like a fossil.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.264
- Gotcha.
- And there's no way you're
gonna get that through there.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.232
- Gotcha. Gotcha.
- You have a real problem
right now.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.867
Oh, man.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.036
Joe:
Guys, less than 20 minutes left.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.705
So, Shanika's
in a big mess.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.275
- Come on.
- Gordon: The way
that pasta's too dry,

28:29.308 --> 28:30.676
you got no chance
of making a ravioli.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.210
Yeah.
It's gonna open up on you.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.845
- It won't stick together.
- Oh, my God!

28:33.879 --> 28:36.782
Gordon:
45 minutes gone,
15 minutes remaining.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.785
Whoa!
Pasta needs 15 minutes to rest

28:39.818 --> 28:41.420
before you could even
shape it or cut it.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.455
Come on.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.856
- Come on, Shanika.
You could do it.
- Let's go, Shanika.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.792
- Farhan: Come on, girl.
- There's no time

28:46.825 --> 28:48.594
to start another batch of dough.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.796
- Damn it!
- It's over. It can't be done.

28:50.829 --> 28:53.765
It's gonna need a freakin'
miracle right now.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.634
She has to be able to get
that pasta dough through
that sheeter.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.404
If she can't, she might as well
hand over her apron now.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.244
Gordon:
15 minutes remaining.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.480
It's gonna need a freakin'
miracle right now.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.649
Shanika has to be able
to get that pasta dough
through that sheeter.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.051
If she can't, she might as well
hand over her apron now.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.453
Oh, my God!

29:14.486 --> 29:16.388
We only have about 15 minutes
to go,

29:16.422 --> 29:18.490
and there is not enough time
for me to restart this dough.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.459
So I'm gonna try to fix it.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.893
I'm gonna see if I can save it.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.562
I'm gonna wet this a little bit,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.331
I'm gonna knead it
a little bit more.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.499
Come on, come on.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.501
I have to make this pasta work.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.337
It's a little better.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.605
It's a little better.
I think I can do it.

29:33.639 --> 29:36.908
- Cesar: Shanika's is
looking better.
- Turn up, Shanika. Turn up.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.744
Gordon:
Look at Shanika.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.979
She's worked her pasta back,
but the big worry is Bowen.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.248
- Have no sauces on.
- Joe: What is he waiting for?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.417
No idea. I think the pressure's
getting to him.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.419
I will do best job I can.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.422
Gordon:
Right, the youngest wearing
my pin, Samantha.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.123
She's made pasta
hundreds of times

29:52.157 --> 29:54.025
- and she is literally on it.
- There it is.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.161
Gordon:
Three minutes to go.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.596
The one trick to all three
of these pastas,

29:57.629 --> 30:00.265
is that in the sauce pan,
you need to add

30:00.298 --> 30:03.134
some of the pasta boiling water
into the pan,

30:03.168 --> 30:05.971
and the pasta needs to finish
cooking in the sauté pan.

30:06.004 --> 30:07.373
'cause it releases starch,

30:07.406 --> 30:09.375
and the pasta and the sauce
become one.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.542
- And that's the goal.
- Yup.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.143
( screams )

30:12.177 --> 30:14.346
- 60 seconds remaining.
- Let's go!

30:14.380 --> 30:17.015
Joe:
Wait, Bowen is not sautéing
the pasta in the sauce.

30:17.048 --> 30:18.617
Gordon:
Samantha's got her dish.
Good girl.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.386
Aarón:
Serve food, let's go.

30:20.419 --> 30:21.987
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.221
Gordon:
Ashley's got her second
plate down.

30:23.254 --> 30:25.391
35 seconds to go!

30:25.424 --> 30:27.158
Sam's got three plates down.
Well done.

30:27.192 --> 30:28.494
Shanika, come on!

30:28.527 --> 30:33.298
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

30:33.331 --> 30:37.335
five, four, three, two, one.

30:37.369 --> 30:40.205
And stop. Hands in the air.

30:42.007 --> 30:46.311
I wasted so much time making
sure that my dough was right,

30:46.344 --> 30:48.914
that I barely got
my dishes out in time,

30:48.947 --> 30:53.919
and this is my worst performance
in this kitchen.

30:53.952 --> 30:57.489
Home cooks, I can't tell you
how nice it is

30:57.523 --> 31:00.258
to smell home.

31:00.291 --> 31:03.429
And at least one of you
is going home.

31:06.598 --> 31:10.469
Okay, Shanika, let's begin
with the pappardelle
Capricciosa.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.375
Your pasta isn't terrible,
but there's one piece of pasta.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.946
I know.
Not enough.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.347
Okay, moving on.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.282
So these are
the mezzelune.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.284
- Didn't we say burnt butter?
- Yeah.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.286
You didn't have time
to burn the butter.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.522
No, I mean, I had the butter on,
but I had it melting.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.891
And I didn't-- I was running
around doing other stuff

31:32.924 --> 31:34.960
and did not wanna take
my eye off of it too much.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.962
So, it's melted butter.

31:36.995 --> 31:38.296
How did you do
with your filling?

31:38.329 --> 31:40.131
I think I did
pretty good.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.934
Filling's not bad.

31:42.968 --> 31:45.471
It's just that
it's not the dish.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.972
It's just raw butter.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.541
It tastes like popcorn
in a movie theater.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.977
And the garganelli
with funghi trifolati.

31:52.010 --> 31:55.447
What happened here?
You made one, two,
three garganelli.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.283
- Yeah.
- I mean, like literally,
these dishes look like

31:58.316 --> 31:59.485
if I was a waiter
in a restaurant

31:59.518 --> 32:02.087
and I just cleared
your table.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.590
- And this is what you're
presenting to us?
- I don't disagree with you.

32:04.623 --> 32:08.326
I wanted to bring down something
so I brought down what I had.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.361
Joe:
Okay.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.099
I'm not sure what to say,
Shanika.

32:14.132 --> 32:15.467
I'm disappointed in myself
as well.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.036
I know I could do better.

32:20.338 --> 32:23.408
Um, you know, seasoning's on
point, let's get that right.

32:23.441 --> 32:27.112
I just wish you had prioritized.

32:27.145 --> 32:28.847
'cause you got all the skill.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.183
It's just a bad finish.
Thank you.

32:32.217 --> 32:34.620
- Joe: Samantha.
- Joe.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.488
Okay, so let's start with this,

32:36.522 --> 32:39.124
pappardelle Capricciosa.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.426
So the Capricciosa sauce,

32:41.459 --> 32:43.562
- is there onions
and prosciutto in here?
- There is.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.599
Pappardelle Capricciosa,
very nice.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.102
Light, fluffy, your pasta has
a very good texture to it.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.371
- Thank you.
- So these are the mezzelune.

32:53.404 --> 32:54.973
- You happy with them?
- I am.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.042
I wish I hadn't put
that sage leaf on top.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.444
- Yeah, you have to fry it.
- Yeah.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.647
It's a little bit thin
in the filling,

33:01.680 --> 33:03.381
but the pasta shape
itself looks okay.

33:03.414 --> 33:05.183
Let's see what it tastes like.

33:05.216 --> 33:07.385
The brown butter's good,
taste of sage is right.

33:07.418 --> 33:09.655
Very delicate, very light.
Moving on.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.390
This is the garganelli
with funghi trifolati.

33:12.423 --> 33:15.393
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you cook
the mushrooms?

33:15.426 --> 33:18.396
Olive oil, sautéed,
and then threw in some
pasta water at the end.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.331
You taste the garlic,
but not overpowering.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.900
You can taste the thyme.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.402
You can taste real earthy
mushroom flavor.

33:24.435 --> 33:26.638
The garganelli rolled
perfectly.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.306
Sauced perfectly.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.576
- This is kinda textbook.
- Thank you.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.478
It screams more sauce.

33:33.511 --> 33:36.047
And especially the pappardelle
'cause it's denser and longer.

33:36.081 --> 33:37.916
It really can take almost
an over-saucing.

33:37.949 --> 33:41.352
- Okay.
- But the actual pasta,
the base is delicious.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.321
- Great job.
- Thank you.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.355
( whispers )
Nice.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.024
All right, Ashley,

33:46.057 --> 33:48.459
let's start with this
pappardelle Capricciosa.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.098
This pappardelle Capricciosa,

33:53.131 --> 33:54.600
the pasta itself
is like a sheet

33:54.633 --> 33:57.402
of pasta you would make
for lasagna,

33:57.435 --> 33:59.504
which is much thicker
and much more rough.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.207
It's a completely
different take
on the dish.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.244
This is supposed to be
mezzelune in brown butter
sage sauce.

34:06.277 --> 34:07.613
- Yes.
- But you decided
to put mushrooms in it.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.447
It was a misstep.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.683
( whispers )
Damn.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.286
The filling portion
and the actual dimension
of these look about right.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.188
How did you sauté
your Swiss chard?

34:17.222 --> 34:18.289
I blanched them.

34:18.323 --> 34:19.958
I didn't sauté them.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.961
How are you gonna give it
flavor?

34:22.994 --> 34:25.396
Swiss chard is supposed to be
sautéed in garlic and olive oil.

34:26.965 --> 34:29.467
- I didn't know to do that.
- Mm.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.470
I can't evaluate the sauce
because it isn't here,

34:32.503 --> 34:35.641
and the filling is basically
boiled Swiss chard with ricotta.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.909
Okay.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.477
Okay, moving on.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.980
This is the garganelli
with funghi trifolati.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.414
How did you cook
the mushrooms?

34:43.448 --> 34:47.185
I sautéed them in butter
and thyme and some salt.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.122
The mushrooms are
lightly sautéed,

34:51.156 --> 34:53.558
but they're still crunchy.
Very, very good.

34:53.591 --> 34:57.062
The garganelli is actually
a pretty good example.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.363
Not bad.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.969
The salt is right
on all the pastas.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.604
I think the highlight
of your three pastas is
the Capricciosa sauce.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.339
I think it's delicious,

35:08.373 --> 35:11.309
and I think for me, the star
over here is just the mushrooms.

35:11.342 --> 35:13.411
I think 'cause you were
flustered, you messed up sauces.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.513
They're incomplete,

35:15.546 --> 35:17.348
and they're not talking to me
like a pasta should.

35:17.382 --> 35:19.450
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Joe.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.186
( whispers )
Oh, man.

35:21.219 --> 35:22.620
Okay, Bowen.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.422
Here we certainly have
the most creative

35:24.455 --> 35:28.359
interpretation of pasta.

35:28.393 --> 35:30.461
Yeah.

35:30.495 --> 35:32.130
You took the prosciutto
and fried it

35:32.163 --> 35:35.433
in, like, these lumps,
which is a little bit strange.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.103
- And this is your pasta?
- Yes.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.371
I never had pasta before,
so I definitely gonna try--

35:40.405 --> 35:42.373
You never had pasta before?

35:42.407 --> 35:44.109
- No.
- You never ate pasta once?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.544
I never ate pasta.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.446
So you come here
to "MasterChef,"

35:48.479 --> 35:51.316
to the biggest cooking
competition in the world,

35:51.349 --> 35:55.020
- from China to win it...
- ( whispers ) Oh, geez.

35:55.053 --> 35:58.957
...and you never, ever tried
pasta before coming here?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.959
Mm.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.094
Unfortunately, not.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.640
You never tried pasta
before coming here?

36:15.673 --> 36:18.343
Unfortunately, not.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.555
It's like eating a tissue.

36:30.588 --> 36:31.990
It just dissolves
under your tongue.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.825
But I think
the flavor is good.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.661
- You think the flavor is good?
It's disappointing.
- Yes.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.396
Joe:
Okay.

36:38.429 --> 36:39.831
What is this stuff here?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.433
It's brown butter
with a--

36:42.467 --> 36:44.369
- Chopped up sage?
- Yes.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.171
You see, here you have
the same problem.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.707
The pasta is so thin
it can't even hold
the ravioli.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.676
It's just, like,
disintegrating.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.113
- What's inside?
- Swiss chard
with ricotta cheese.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.682
I sautéed the Swiss chard
with salt and pepper.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.185
Oh, the filling's very good.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.353
Swiss chard tastes nice,
taste garlic,

37:02.387 --> 37:05.456
but again your pasta
doesn't hold the form.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.458
( whispers )
Those are dumplings.

37:07.492 --> 37:09.294
So these are garganelli,

37:09.327 --> 37:11.596
but they're completely flat.

37:11.629 --> 37:14.132
The ones I made were round.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.600
How did you cook
the mushrooms?

37:15.633 --> 37:18.603
Sautéed them with olive oil,
salt and pepper,

37:18.636 --> 37:20.605
and a touch of butter.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.409
They're excellent.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.945
But Bowen, I mean,
the problem here is that

37:26.978 --> 37:28.713
this is not really pasta.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.449
You boiled noodles and then
put condiments on the side.

37:31.482 --> 37:35.253
Pasta has to cook
with the sauce
by definition.

37:35.286 --> 37:37.255
This is really interesting,

37:37.288 --> 37:40.391
'cause outside of the pasta,
everything else is really good.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.062
Pasta too thin,
but on-point seasoning.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.564
You can cook
and you're gifted,

37:46.597 --> 37:49.600
but this was about replicating
what you got shown,

37:49.634 --> 37:51.837
and you can't even
bother to do that.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.642
I'm disappointed in myself,

37:57.675 --> 37:59.344
because Joe is the reason
I'm here,

37:59.377 --> 38:02.180
and I definitely think
I let him down today.

38:02.213 --> 38:05.683
But I'm feeling
a little bit optimistic

38:05.716 --> 38:08.486
because Ashley and Bowen
both had mistakes.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.588
It's three of us
that didn't do too good.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.590
Which one is gonna be the worst?

38:12.623 --> 38:14.592
And I'm hoping it's not me.

38:14.625 --> 38:18.329
One home cook is going home
minutes from now.

38:18.363 --> 38:22.600
But tonight, one home cook
really showed us

38:22.633 --> 38:25.036
their skill under pressure.

38:25.070 --> 38:28.273
Samantha,
mentored by myself.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.674
( whispers )
Nice!

38:29.707 --> 38:31.476
You cook pasta
like an old Italian lady.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.611
( laughs )

38:33.644 --> 38:35.680
- And that's good.
- Yes, thank you.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.782
Now, head up to the safety
of the balcony, please.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.550
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

38:39.584 --> 38:43.121
- Good job, Samantha.
- Gordon: Well done.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.356
Samantha:
I'm elated right now.

38:45.390 --> 38:48.526
I came into this knowing
that I had to cook for my life,

38:48.559 --> 38:51.196
and I did that and then some.

38:51.229 --> 38:54.132
- Come here, nonna. Ciao.
- ( laughs ) Thank you.

38:54.165 --> 38:58.836
There is another home cook
that did just enough to be safe.

38:58.870 --> 39:03.241
There were enough compelling
elements on the plate

39:03.274 --> 39:05.643
to show us they deserve
their place in this kitchen.

39:05.676 --> 39:10.215
And this home cook
also has Gordon's pin on.

39:11.716 --> 39:13.451
Ashley.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.087
Up to the balcony.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.123
Thank you.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.227
That leaves Shanika and Bowen,

39:22.260 --> 39:25.430
one with Joe's pin
and one with my pin.

39:25.463 --> 39:27.665
This is a really tough decision.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.735
'cause you both had a bad night.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.141
Bowen...

39:37.575 --> 39:42.247
your time, my friend,
in this kitchen...

39:42.280 --> 39:44.215
is not quite over.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.317
You are safe.

39:47.752 --> 39:52.690
And I'm losing one
of my home cooks.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.594
Bowen, go to
the balcony, please.

39:56.627 --> 39:58.596
( sighs )

39:58.629 --> 40:02.200
I can't believe
I am going to be safe.

40:02.233 --> 40:05.370
Moving forward,
I will work my butt off

40:05.403 --> 40:07.305
to be a really good listener

40:07.338 --> 40:10.241
and to make Gordon proud
to give me that apron.

40:10.275 --> 40:13.244
Shanika, this was
a tough test for you.

40:13.278 --> 40:16.314
It's unfortunate that pasta
should be able to take down

40:16.347 --> 40:18.716
such a lioness like you.

40:18.749 --> 40:23.788
So, I'm very, very sad that this
had to happen on my challenge.

40:23.821 --> 40:26.557
Young lady, understand
what you have achieved,

40:26.591 --> 40:28.126
and remember how strong you are.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.594
We're sorry to see you go.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.196
Come up here and say goodbye.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.133
- Don't stop that determination.
- Oh, I won't.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.634
- Gordon: Please. Thank you.
- Aarón: Great job.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.269
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.506
Seven remain up
on the balcony.

40:41.539 --> 40:43.741
Who is America's
next MasterChef?

40:43.774 --> 40:45.510
It's gonna be Bowen.
He's gonna get focused

40:45.543 --> 40:47.745
and he's gonna win it.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.281
- Shanika, please place
your apron on your bench.
- Bye, guys.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.583
- Bye, Shanika.
- Gordon: Have a safe trip home.
Thank you.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.818
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, guys.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.753
I don't wanna go home,

40:55.786 --> 40:57.655
but I'm super proud
of how far I've come.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.457
Before this competition,

40:59.490 --> 41:00.925
I didn't have
any fancy schooling.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.628
Everything that I knew
I taught myself.

41:03.661 --> 41:06.831
But MasterChef has pushed me
and tested me

41:06.864 --> 41:10.535
like I've never even
imagined before.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.670
- Gerron: Bye, Shanika.
- It's some fire in me.

41:12.703 --> 41:14.705
So, world, watch out.

41:20.711 --> 41:21.846
Narrator:
Next time...

41:21.879 --> 41:25.150
Ladies and gentlemen...

41:25.183 --> 41:28.153
...the one and only,
Gordon Ramsay.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.954
- I see you, Chef.
- Want a picture?

41:29.987 --> 41:32.390
- ...a culinary legend...
- That's my mentor.

41:32.423 --> 41:35.693
...joins the top seven as
they attempt to turn trash...

41:35.726 --> 41:38.796
There's carcasses.
What am I gonna do with this?

41:38.829 --> 41:42.867
- ...into treasure.
- This is a real showstopper.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.635
- Excuse me, look away.
- Whoa!

41:44.669 --> 41:46.137
- Wow.
- ( whistles )

41:46.171 --> 41:47.738
Mmm.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.174
That's America's next
MasterChef right there.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.176
Competition over.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.417
You've just taken a bite
out of MasterChef.
