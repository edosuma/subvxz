01:45.280 --> 01:46.760
Come in.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.040
Hey.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.880
Here's the research you wanted.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.520
All this for one
chemistry project?

01:57.600 --> 01:58.680
You said you wanted help.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.160
Can we go to the cafe?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.320
I would like to eat
something this month.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.960
Yeah, you coming, Zac?
-Uh, I'm hanging out with Evie today.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.360
If I can tear myself
away from this.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.039
Hey, cheer up.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.840
Where's that famous
Zac Blakely smile?

02:15.120 --> 02:17.080
I didn't have chemistry projects
when I was 12.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.320
What's this?

02:25.600 --> 02:26.920
I found it on the
reef this morning.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.280
Oh, it's beautiful. I've never
seen anything like it before.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.040
Oh, school used to be a breeze.
I played all the time.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.880
Life was pretty good as a kid.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.280
I wish you could
have seen me then.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.280
Guys?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.360
Cam, get here quick.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.600
There are three
girls in my room!

03:38.360 --> 03:39.640
Guys?

03:40.560 --> 03:42.200
Where did Zac go?

03:42.280 --> 03:44.160
How do you know my name?

03:44.240 --> 03:46.760
You're Zac?
-Yes.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.640
Just like the photo.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.960
How did you do that?
-Do what?

03:53.040 --> 03:55.480
You just appeared...
out of nothing.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.840
Who are you?

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
We're...

03:59.880 --> 04:01.000
aliens.

04:09.960 --> 04:10.960
Zac?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.760
Are you getting ready?
For Evie's party?

04:14.840 --> 04:15.920
Yeah.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.600
I left a card with the present,
did you see it?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.079
Yeah.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.000
Is everything all right, darling?
-Yeah.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.200
We're leaving in an hour.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.840
You are aliens!

04:35.000 --> 04:36.440
Cam, hurry up!

04:36.520 --> 04:38.600
Get over here!
-We need to get out of here.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.600
Can someone explain
what's going on?

04:48.680 --> 04:50.760
I have no idea.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.360
Why is Zac so young?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.920
Did we do that to him?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.640
It's almost like
we time traveled.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.120
That's ridiculous.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.080
We have to find Rita.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.120
Where are the girls?
-They're not just girls, Cam.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.880
They're aliens.
-Come on, Blakely.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.520
I race over here,
expecting to see girls...

05:17.600 --> 05:19.520
then you tell me they're aliens?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.080
They're aliens who
look like girls.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.640
So they just look like girls...

05:24.760 --> 05:26.040
or they are girls?

05:26.120 --> 05:27.200
Which is it?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.800
I-- I don't know.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.640
Maybe they're girls and aliens
at the same time.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.720
As if. I've got a
party to get ready for.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.920
Wait!

05:35.000 --> 05:36.240
They might come back.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.840
You have to see them, Cam.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.040
Act your age, Blakely.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.240
Only little kids
believe in aliens.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.320
Have you got
a better explanation?

06:02.400 --> 06:04.480
Time travel is a fantasy.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.240
Let's just find Rita
and sort this out.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.400
What are you doing here?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.520
Rita,
something weird is happening.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.800
Who are you?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.800
How did you get in here?
- We swam in...

06:17.880 --> 06:19.120
like we always do.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.800
Veridia sent you, didn't she?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.000
What?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.120
No.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.280
I knew she'd send someone. I
didn't expect three hatchlings.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.400
What are you talking about?

06:28.480 --> 06:29.880
Veridia didn't send us.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.880
You can tell her
my mind is made up.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.960
I'm staying here, on land.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.240
I don't understand.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.120
It's simple.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.760
This is my home...

06:40.840 --> 06:42.400
and right now I have
work to do at school,

06:42.480 --> 06:45.520
so tell Veridia I'm not
coming back to the pod.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.800
Ever.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.720
Now go.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.960
No. We live here, with you.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.680
You live here with me?
- Yeah.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.040
You and Poseidon.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.640
Poseidon?

07:03.720 --> 07:05.800
Your fluffy, white cat?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.760
I don't have a cat.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.360
But, Rita--
-Go!

07:09.440 --> 07:11.200
And don't come back!

07:21.000 --> 07:22.480
It makes sense.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.640
Zac's a kid.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.520
Rita's younger.
-Okay.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.920
So we've traveled back in time.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.760
How?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.480
The seashell!

07:31.560 --> 07:34.760
It glowed, there was a flash of
light, and then we arrived here.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
You're right.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.800
It must have some kind of
magical power over time.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.080
I dropped it in Zac's room.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.200
What are we waiting for?

07:41.280 --> 07:42.760
Wait.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.680
We have to be
careful around Zac.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.400
He's a kid.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.120
Ever heard of the
butterfly effect?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.400
If we interfere with the past...

07:51.480 --> 07:53.760
it could alter the future
beyond recognition.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.400
We don't have a choice.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.680
Hey, Zac! You want a juice?

08:05.760 --> 08:07.360
Uh, sure. Sure.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.520
Have you seen Mimmi?

08:09.240 --> 08:10.280
Who?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.080
Ondina?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.360
Weilan?

08:14.400 --> 08:15.840
You know, the mer--

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
The mermaids.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.640
Sorry. I wish I had, though.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.440
If mermaids were real, I would
definitely want to meet one.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.800
What do you mean, "if"?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.800
You sure have a
wild imagination.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.039
What happened to the aliens?

08:33.360 --> 08:36.039
What aliens?
-You tell me.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.280
Have you seen Evie?

08:38.360 --> 08:40.080
Yeah,
I think she's on the beach.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.120
Hey, don't you want that juice?

08:52.680 --> 08:53.760
Cam!

09:00.200 --> 09:02.080
Take over, will you?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.520
Man, am I happy to see you!

09:04.600 --> 09:06.080
Whoa, there, Blakely.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.520
Three paces at all times.
People might be watching.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.720
So what's up?

09:11.280 --> 09:13.400
I-- I've been having
the weirdest day ever.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.600
Yeah.
-Oh, yeah?

09:14.680 --> 09:15.880
See another UFO, did you?

09:16.840 --> 09:18.920
Impending alien invasion?
-What?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.920
You know those big metal things
up in the sky?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.080
They're called airplanes.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.800
Hey, Evie.
-Hey.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.160
Evie!

09:29.160 --> 09:30.440
You're with Cam?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.760
Chicks love a man in uniform.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.840
I knew you'd come back.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.640
I can't see it.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.640
Oh, Cam's going to be
sorry he missed you.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.680
Don't worry,
I didn't tell anyone else.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.920
Can you show me your spaceship?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.240
Put a clam in it and
give us the seashell!

09:55.320 --> 09:56.800
What seashell?

09:56.880 --> 09:59.360
There is a shiny seashell here,
Zac, that is important.

09:59.440 --> 10:00.720
We need it to get home.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.080
But you just got here.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.000
Hand it over or I will zap you
into outer space.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.400
Ondina!

10:07.480 --> 10:09.440
Are you sure you
haven't seen the shell?

10:12.920 --> 10:13.960
I...

10:15.760 --> 10:16.760
Um...

10:19.120 --> 10:20.880
Got it. Let's go.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.600
Please, you can't leave now!

10:22.680 --> 10:24.960
Meeting you was the coolest
thing that's ever happened to me.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.760
Zac? Are you ready?

10:28.560 --> 10:31.160
You should go.
- Zac, hurry up!

10:34.600 --> 10:36.680
We were never here, right?

10:49.240 --> 10:51.040
You shouldn't have
been so hard on him.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.080
We got the shell,
that's what matters.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.240
It won't matter at all unless
we figure out how it works.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.320
Ms. Santos.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.520
Ms. Trumble.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.480
Working on a Saturday, are we?

11:09.560 --> 11:12.520
It's good to see such dedication
in the junior staff.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.640
I'll be keeping an eye on you
when I'm in charge.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.760
In charge?

11:17.840 --> 11:20.760
The school board is interviewing
me for the position of principal.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.920
Oh.

11:22.720 --> 11:23.800
Really?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.840
Well, the interview is merely
a formality, of course.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.240
I'm perfect for the job.
They know that.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.080
Actually, I...
was thinking of applying.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.440
Rita! We need to talk to you.
-Right now.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.800
If you don't mind.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.080
How dare you
follow me to my place of work?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.240
You have no right.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.120
Rita, you have to listen to us.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.400
We're from the future.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.560
It's true. We live with you,
five years from now.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.800
All right.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.880
If you know me in the future,
prove it.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.840
You like seaweed cordial.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.240
Every mermaid likes
seaweed cordial.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.320
You're the principal here.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.000
Excuse me?

12:11.080 --> 12:13.680
You're the principal
of this school.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.520
How could you
possibly know that?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.480
I only decided to apply
for that position this morning.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.560
Like we said...

12:23.640 --> 12:25.240
we're from the future.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.200
Time travel?

12:30.160 --> 12:31.640
How is that even possible?

12:31.720 --> 12:33.800
Well,
it doesn't happen every day.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.120
Show her the seashell.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.080
This is a wishing shell.

12:41.880 --> 12:42.880
They're incredibly rare.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.920
I've heard of them, but this
is the first one I've seen.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.680
Tell me exactly what happened.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.320
We were with our friend, Zac, looking
at a photo of him when he was younger.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
He said...

12:57.240 --> 12:59.280
"I wish you could
have seen me then."

13:00.360 --> 13:03.520
When Zac made that wish,
the shell made it come true.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.360
By sending us back
to Zac's childhood.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.480
If it's a wishing shell,
let's wish ourselves home.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.000
Hmm.
- It's not that easy.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.760
If Zac found the shell,
then he controls it.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.680
It has to be his choice
to wish you back.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.480
And if he doesn't want to?

13:22.280 --> 13:25.720
Then... you can never return.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.760
Morning, Zac.
-We're going shopping.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.040
Is there anything you want?
-Mum, Dad, I am so glad to see you.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.400
Sit down.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.760
Sit down.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.760
Okay, something very
strange is happening.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.560
I know this is going to
sound weird, but...

13:59.080 --> 14:00.200
The guy in this picture,

14:00.280 --> 14:01.520
he's not me.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.080
I mean, I mean,
he looks like me...

14:05.160 --> 14:07.600
but it's not me.
You can see that, right?

14:08.680 --> 14:10.320
Zac, are you feeling all right?

14:11.240 --> 14:14.960
Look... I woke up this morning
and everything was normal.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.920
Then, all of a sudden,
something happened

14:17.000 --> 14:19.040
and now I'm in some kind
of alternate reality

14:19.120 --> 14:21.200
where everything is different.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.720
None of this is real!

14:27.120 --> 14:29.440
Is everything all
right at school?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.000
Rita?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.920
Hello? Rita?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.000
Rita?

15:22.480 --> 15:23.600
Enjoying your party, Evie?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.080
It's great, Dad. Thanks.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.240
These are delicious,
Mr. McLaren.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.640
Zac!

15:34.720 --> 15:36.080
I was hoping you'd come.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.240
Happy birthday, Evie.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.520
Thanks.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.760
Ah, back again.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.280
You want that juice now?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.240
Where's Rita?

15:49.320 --> 15:50.400
Rita?

15:51.320 --> 15:53.280
Our school principal,
Ms. Santos. Where is she?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.680
She moved overseas years ago.

15:55.760 --> 15:57.560
Everyone knows that.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.320
Something on your mind?

16:04.680 --> 16:06.280
You wouldn't believe me.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.160
I know people give you a hard
time about your strange theories,

16:09.240 --> 16:10.920
but I agree with you.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.680
There are so many mysteries in
this world. More than we realize.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.240
What would you say if I told you
I come from an alternate reality?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.640
Come on, Zac.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.960
That's a bit extreme...
even for you.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.000
How long have I been
obsessed with aliens?

16:33.360 --> 16:37.680
Oh, ever since...
Evie's 12th birthday party.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.600
Everything all right out here?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.240
It's great, Dad.
-Terrific.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.640
Well, I'll pop inside
and decorate the cake.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.240
Wouldn't be a birthday party
without a cake.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.600
Go away.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.880
You got your seashell.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.839
I wasn't very nice
to you before.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
I'm sorry.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.079
Can we go somewhere and talk?

17:13.160 --> 17:14.200
We need your help.

17:14.280 --> 17:15.480
Really?

17:16.319 --> 17:17.440
These are the girls?

17:18.280 --> 17:19.319
These are the aliens...

17:19.400 --> 17:20.640
and they need my help.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.880
Aliens?
-Yeah.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.960
Zac said he had
aliens in his bedroom.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.440
They don't look much
like aliens to me.

17:28.520 --> 17:30.600
They are aliens!

17:33.880 --> 17:35.040
Show them!

17:35.120 --> 17:36.920
Do your disappearing trick!

17:37.000 --> 17:38.720
Blakely's finally lost it.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.360
Please!

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
What disappearing trick?

17:50.640 --> 17:52.360
Let me talk to him.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.800
Hi, ladies. I'm Cam.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.240
You can call me the Camster.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.880
Leave me alone.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.520
I'm sorry I embarrassed you,
Zac.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.320
Aliens have to
keep a low profile.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.280
But we really do need your help.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.000
Why?

18:34.080 --> 18:38.000
Well, because, you're special.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.760
No, I'm not.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.520
Well, you're special to me.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.960
See, we're not just aliens.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.360
We're from the future...

18:50.440 --> 18:54.920
and in the future, you and
I are really good friends.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.960
As close as brother and sister.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.120
So what?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.040
Everyone here thinks I'm crazy.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.240
Even Evie.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.280
Hmm.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.240
I might be able to do
something about that.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.520
Can I freshen that drink?

19:17.520 --> 19:18.720
How old are you?

19:18.800 --> 19:19.840
Twelve.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.160
But my mum tells me
I look a lot older.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.920
How about a dance?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.720
Maybe later.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.200
Can I have everyone's attention?

19:38.600 --> 19:39.840
I understand that

19:39.920 --> 19:42.560
there are some of you here
who don't believe in aliens.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.360
My friends and I are, in fact,
from a distant planet

19:47.440 --> 19:48.640
and shall now prove it.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.640
What are you doing?
-Trust me.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.800
What planet are you from?

19:52.680 --> 19:56.040
A planet where the laws of
gravity are upside-down...

19:56.680 --> 19:58.680
and everything floats.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
Whoa!

20:02.120 --> 20:03.880
That's amazing.
-Look at that.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.800
Weilan.

20:09.280 --> 20:10.560
Whoa!

20:10.640 --> 20:12.080
Catch.
-That's amazing.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.720
How did you do that?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.080
They're not aliens.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.520
It's just a magic trick.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.520
Plastic balls on wires.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.080
And now a special
gift from Zac to Evie,

20:32.160 --> 20:33.680
the birthday girl.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.280
Awesome present, Zac!

20:46.320 --> 20:47.360
Ready?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.720
If this doesn't work,
you guys will be doing

20:50.800 --> 20:52.680
kids parties for the
rest of your lives.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.960
It's amazing.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.000
What do you want me to do?

21:04.080 --> 21:06.000
This is a magical wishing shell.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.040
Just say, "I wish things back
the way they were."

21:09.120 --> 21:10.680
Then we'll be able
to go back home.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.600
But I don't want you to go.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.280
I meant what I said earlier,
Zac.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.280
You and I will meet
again in the future.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
Promise?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.520
Promise.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.400
Okay.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.400
I wish things back
the way they were.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.040
School used to be a breeze.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.080
I played all the time.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.600
Life was good as a kid.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.160
I wish you could--

21:46.240 --> 21:47.880
Be careful what you wish for.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.840
Did I miss something?

21:55.920 --> 21:57.520
Do you feel all right?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.960
Uh...

21:59.840 --> 22:00.840
Yeah.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.400
No memory of anything
weird happening just now?

22:04.480 --> 22:05.480
No.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.280
What's going on?

22:09.200 --> 22:11.040
Hey.
- Hey.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.800
So, what's the plan?

22:13.880 --> 22:15.520
Cam and Carly are
going to a movie.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.440
Open invite.
-That sounds great.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
Do you guys want to come?

22:18.600 --> 22:20.280
It's a sci-fi.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.800
<i>The Time Traveler.</i>

22:23.240 --> 22:24.960
I think we'll pass.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.040
There you are.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.720
Oh. Hey, Evie.

22:38.800 --> 22:39.840
I've been looking for you.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.600
What are you doing here?

22:44.200 --> 22:45.920
It... it's weird.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.400
I can't remember.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.200
We're cutting the cake.
I didn't want you to miss it.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.960
I'm really glad you came, Zac.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
Me, too.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.880
Come on.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.160
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:02.240 --> 23:03.640
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:03.720 --> 23:07.040
