I did call.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.454
Abigail's fine, by the way.
It was just a bad bruise.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.194
It's not gonna work.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.028
Stephanie, I'm a doctor.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.364
I'm going to have
emergencies come up
from time to time.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.700
Give me another chance.
Dinner tomorrow?

00:34.001 --> 00:35.269
What'd you say?

00:35.303 --> 00:38.272
I'll pick you up,
take you anywhere
you want to go.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.878
-Okay.
-Great. It's a date.

Nick's gone too.

Well, now we both

You think Grace is with Nick?

01:06.734 --> 01:07.835
I have a feeling.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.503
Well, your feelings
are usually spot on,

01:09.537 --> 01:10.838
they're not exactly
best buds.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.173
Yeah, I know, but...

01:12.206 --> 01:14.475
-Did you try her cell?
-She left it at home.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.777
And he's not
answering his.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.381
Well, it's still early,
and it's Grace.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.217
-She's a good kid.
-Yeah, Nick too.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.287
Well, I love him,

-No, she left him.

She's probably studying
somewhere else.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.120

What were you doing there?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.591

I wouldn't have to.

In the future,
be more careful. Okay?

be here to help.

No big deal.

04:24.298 --> 04:28.001
When I told you not to,
it's a very big deal.

Grace wasn't with you,
was she?

Your father's compass.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.729
Yeah.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.133
That was given to him
by your grandfather.

05:00.167 --> 05:03.371
When your dad
went into the Army
he took it with him.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.974
The last part of boot camp
was survival training.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.809
Your dad found himself out
in the middle of nowhere

05:08.842 --> 05:11.078
with not much more
than that compass.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.746
Wow!

05:12.780 --> 05:15.483
He had doubts of surviving
survival training,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.953
but that compass helped him
find his way back.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.254
It meant a lot to him.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.858
Yeah. It reminded him

05:24.892 --> 05:26.360
that we all have
an internal compass

05:26.394 --> 05:29.397
that points us
in the right direction.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.132

we get lost.

for tonight.

Nick had snuck out.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.820
So, I got him in trouble?

Other people can't
get us into trouble,

into trouble.

control everything,

there are always
unexpected variables
that change things.

I can control
the variables.

No, you can't,

them variables.

my mind to something,
I can do it.

from medical school

gotten out of med school.

want this development

to change the face

09:19.292 --> 09:20.994
Middleton is a grand old lady,

12:20.407 --> 12:22.810
I don't think she's coming
for the food.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.912
(CHUCKLES) Still,
I wanted to be...

12:24.945 --> 12:26.479
-Special?
-Edible.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.349
I used to date a chef.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.951
He taught me
everything I know.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.220
I can teach you.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.388
It's the least I can do,
after all the trouble
I caused.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.991
Are you sure?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.861
Yes. Please,
let me do this.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.430
It'll be a meal Stephanie
won't forget.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.006
There we go.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.507
Thank you.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.544
-Hi, Stephanie.
-Hi.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.846
-For me?
-Yes.

12:58.879 --> 12:59.913
Oh, thank you.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.082
It's a gluten free
chicken noodle soup.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.418
Oh, with no chicken
and no noodles.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.620
Hmm. So, it's a broth?

13:07.654 --> 13:10.190
If it were just a broth,
I couldn't charge $7.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.658
Ah, I see.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.061
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13:14.094 --> 13:16.729
So, Sam hasn't
called to cancel,

13:17.664 --> 13:19.967
and now that the dinner
is at his house,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.334
if he doesn't show,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.937
he'll either have
to leave town or move.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.138
(CHUCKLES)

13:25.172 --> 13:27.007
I have never,
and I mean never,

13:27.040 --> 13:29.309
given a man
this many chances.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.078
But I think he's worth it.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.614
Ugh, men, they can be
so frustrating!

13:34.647 --> 13:35.916
Aw. You know,

13:35.949 --> 13:37.817
I think the frustration
comes from

13:37.851 --> 13:39.686
not being able to
get someone to do
what we want

13:39.719 --> 13:42.956
or to react the way we want.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.859
Well then, I think
Ryan is a little
frustrated with you.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.495
Well, I can't help that.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.965
I think he really
likes you.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.301
(SIGHS) Well,
I really like him.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.271
But...

13:58.305 --> 14:01.308
But I think we were talking
about you and Sam.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.244
Nice deflection.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.378
Thank you.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.814
(CHUCKLING)

14:08.916 --> 14:10.583
Nick, wait up.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.054
I know you're in trouble.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.322
I'm always in trouble.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.557
But this time
it's because of me.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.859
Doesn't matter.

14:19.893 --> 14:23.096
I'm going to tell your dad
what you did
for me last night.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.397
He sees me a certain way

14:24.431 --> 14:25.999
and that's never
going to change.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.767
Yes, it will.

14:32.139 --> 14:36.309
Look, you feel guilty
and you want
to not feel guilty.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.445
You want me to tell you,
it's okay.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.413
It is.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.584
You're off the hook.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.986
With me, at least.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.966
Well, hello there.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.000
Hi.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.170
I know that look.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.205
(CHUCKLES)

15:08.741 --> 15:09.977
You working on a story?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.413
I have a hunch
that someone

15:13.446 --> 15:15.215
isn't being truthful
about their motives.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.685
Who's Abigail?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.788
You know I don't like
to talk about

15:21.821 --> 15:23.856
what I'm writing
before I write it.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.558
Sorry, you're right.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.037
-(CHUCKLING) Hey, thanks.
-Anytime.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.671
I'm making dinner
for Stephanie.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.173
Oh, you need help?

15:40.207 --> 15:41.608
Nope. Got it all
under control.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.677
I'm sure you do.
So, what's on the menu?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.713
-Beef Bourguignon.
-Ambitious.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.016
-And French.
Abigail helped me.
-Ooh.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.150
Did she?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.951
If you can read,
you can cook.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.254
Uh, and she told you that?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.922
Yup.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.990
Well...

15:57.024 --> 16:00.360
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

16:00.393 --> 16:01.728
Bon appetit.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.564
Well, it is either
very French of me
to try to make this

16:04.597 --> 16:05.898
or it's very stupid.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.069
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

16:09.836 --> 16:11.104
Well, uh, good luck.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.540
Luck's not a factor.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.150
ABIGAIL: Hi.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.519
Hello.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.221
I think you and I
need to talk.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.723
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.294
Well, I have a date.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.398
Sam made you wait.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.768
Maybe it's his turn now.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.653
(MUFFLED BEEPING)

17:03.656 --> 17:05.092
(BEEPING GROWS LOUDER)

17:05.125 --> 17:07.194
Sam? Is everything okay?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.531
-Turn it off!
-I can't.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.566
-Well, do something!
-I am!

17:15.102 --> 17:16.836
Watch out.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.071
Uh, need some help?

17:21.808 --> 17:22.909
He set the kitchen on fire.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.713
(SIGHS)

17:35.522 --> 17:36.556
You can't be serious.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.725
But I am.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.261
You want to tear down
every building on this list?

17:41.294 --> 17:44.197
Tempus fugit, Ryan.
Tempus fugit.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.699
We want to bring in
young people, new blood.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.601
They don't want
drafty old Victorians.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.103
They want what we're offering.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.171
"We"?

17:51.204 --> 17:54.040
"Small town with great
economic development."

17:54.073 --> 17:58.511
Oh, my, this is how
big political careers
get started.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.281
I probably shouldn't
tell you this
because it's not official,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.015
but I am thinking
of exploring...

18:03.049 --> 18:05.084
(WHISPERING)
...higher office!

18:05.118 --> 18:08.388
How does "Governor
Martha Tinsdale" sound?

18:10.022 --> 18:11.658
-Uh...
-I know!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.826
Just takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.995
-Yeah.
-This development
is actually

18:16.028 --> 18:19.366
going to develop me
straight into
the Governor's mansion,

18:19.399 --> 18:22.902
and the whole state
will have you to thank for it.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.204
Mmm...

18:34.647 --> 18:37.049
You know
I'm not interested in Sam.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.051
You seem interested.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.653
But I'm not.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.590
Let me ask you something.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.625
Would a man who is truly
interested in you

18:45.658 --> 18:48.261
let me or anything
get in the way
of being with you?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.063
(SCOFFS) Boy...

18:51.097 --> 18:52.665
You don't pull any punches.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.335
I call it like I see it.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.137
And I think you see it, too.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.643
So, this is some kind of
public service
you're offering?

19:03.676 --> 19:06.078
A kind of
anti-Match.com?

19:06.112 --> 19:08.815
You deserve someone
who's totally into you.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.492
-The oven is on broil.
-Yeah.

19:19.526 --> 19:24.264
You don't broil anything
for two hours
except logs on a fire.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.065
How exactly did Abigail
help you?

19:26.098 --> 19:27.434
She gave me the recipe.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.203
Okay, Beef Bourguignon
is really complicated.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.771
Abigail thought
I could handle it.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.039
(SIGHS)

19:33.072 --> 19:36.243
Julia Child's
Beef Bourguignon recipe
is three pages long.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.944
-Oh!
-Yeah.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.112
So, did you
follow the recipe?

19:41.614 --> 19:44.517
Well, it was kind of
complicated so I just
decided to wing it.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.320
Oh, did you, uh,
read any books

19:47.354 --> 19:50.223
before you performed
your first surgery
or did you just wing it?

19:50.257 --> 19:53.125
-I was doing
just fine until...
-The fire.

19:53.159 --> 19:56.028
The fire, and that's when
the wheels came off.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.797
I've got to call Stephanie
and cancel.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.031
I can't feed her
this burned mess.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.533
Don't call. Don't cancel.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.502
Well, I have to!

20:02.535 --> 20:04.971
Look, one Merrywick woman
got you into this,

20:05.004 --> 20:07.540
so another one's
going to get you out.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.915
I can't take all your food
for my dinner date.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.016
Oh, I bought plenty.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.552
What are you making?

20:19.586 --> 20:22.922
Well, give a man a fish,
he'll eat for a day,

20:22.955 --> 20:24.791
but teach a man to fish...

20:24.824 --> 20:26.493
But this is chicken.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.562
(SIGHS)

20:31.264 --> 20:32.865
You're loving this,
aren't you?

20:32.899 --> 20:36.403
What, that you burned
down your kitchen
and are taking my dinner?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.504
That you're in control.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.971
Oh, I don't
believe in control.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.941
What do you believe then?

20:41.974 --> 20:44.911
Your ability to peel and chop
a pound of carrots.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.347
Who's coming to dinner,
Bugs Bunny?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.248
Would you rather carve
and sear the chicken?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.684
No, I think it's best
to keep me away
from open flames.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.052
(LAUGHS)

20:53.686 --> 20:55.121

-Hey.
-Hi.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.035
You okay?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.103
No.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.373
You want to talk?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.275
Yeah.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.114

21:22.148 --> 21:24.784
You know,
anything you tell me
will stay between us.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.218
Thanks.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.223
You lied about the library,
didn't you?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.829
-How did you know?
-I'm your sister.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.232
I feel terrible.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.669
I can tell.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.773
You wanna tell me
what really happened?

21:53.212 --> 21:54.681
(EXHALES)

21:54.714 --> 21:56.082
I don't know
how to thank you.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.216
Hmm. You just did.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.621
I hope I didn't mess up
your night.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.189
Oh, no, it's all good.

22:03.222 --> 22:05.057
-I know this isn't easy.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:05.091 --> 22:06.659
You know,
right after my divorce,

22:06.693 --> 22:08.395
I had a lot of first dates.

22:08.428 --> 22:11.197
-Not much repeat business.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:11.230 --> 22:13.466
For some reason,
women didn't want
to hear about

22:13.500 --> 22:16.235
my issues with my ex.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.538
And for some reason
that's all I could talk about.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.540
Your ex?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.975
Tough marriage,
tougher breakup.

we just wanted
different things.

She never really
wanted kids.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.552
Me, I wanted a whole
baseball team.

It's funny how you can think
you know someone

22:34.421 --> 22:36.423
when you don't, really.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.058
What about you and Jake?

22:41.928 --> 22:43.730
I still do.
I miss him every day.

I mean, just to feel
that way about someone,

22:49.168 --> 22:50.870
even for a short
period of time.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.573
Yeah, I am lucky.

-How'd you know?
-(CHUCKLES)

23:57.937 --> 24:02.008
Well, they're half-peeled

and when I say al dente,
I...

24:04.644 --> 24:06.412
I mean raw.

Half-peeled and not cooked,

24:08.715 --> 24:09.882
(LAUGHS)

24:09.916 --> 24:12.485
Well, I love
that you made the effort.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.588
I love that you're here.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.259
(GLASSES CLINKING)

24:29.401 --> 24:30.770
Uh...

24:31.871 --> 24:33.673
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Just... Out of here.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.074
Oh, you don't
have to leave.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.776
Oh, I want to leave.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.844
No, Nick...

24:43.783 --> 24:46.318
Sorry, we couldn't be
at a restaurant.

24:46.352 --> 24:49.622
I understand,
you're a single father.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.423
I also understand
you're a doctor.

24:52.692 --> 24:53.693
I am.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.929
So, how are things
going with Nick?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.532
Too soon to tell.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.868
But I'm hopeful.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.005
How are things
going with us?

25:07.206 --> 25:09.041
It's too soon to tell.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.843
But I'm hopeful.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.178
(CHUCKLING)

25:13.279 --> 25:15.848
I'm sorry
I was late tonight.

25:15.882 --> 25:19.018
Considering my track record,
don't worry about it.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.026
Abigail?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.729
I've been looking for you.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.430
Here I am.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.633
We need to talk.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.534
Found something
out about me, did you?

25:35.568 --> 25:37.103
I did.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.537
Enlighten me.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.974
You are actually telling
the truth about your life.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.244
Yes, I know.

25:45.277 --> 25:48.815
You do have a job
in New York
and an apartment.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.018
You thought I was lying.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.954
I did, because
that's what you do.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.322
Excuse me?

25:57.256 --> 25:58.825
When I was Grace's age,

25:58.858 --> 26:00.559
you'd say you were
coming to town

26:00.593 --> 26:02.695
but then,
you'd never show up.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.530
You'd show up and say

26:04.563 --> 26:05.998
we were going to spend
the day together,

26:06.032 --> 26:08.367
and then you'd blow me off.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.370
You'd take me shopping
and then you'd
ask me for money.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.908
Well, it's probably good
that you're back now,

26:15.942 --> 26:18.110
living in Middleton,

26:18.144 --> 26:19.846
protecting Grace,

26:20.579 --> 26:22.481
being her big sister.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.726
Um, you don't look well.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.227
I'm not.
It's not the food.

26:35.828 --> 26:36.929
What's wrong?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.499
I unleashed Martha
on Middleton.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.768
How?

26:41.801 --> 26:43.836
She's ready to tear down
the whole town.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.037
Isn't that what you want?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.906
No.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.174
But now,
that's what she wants.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.408
She's got this whole
list of buildings

26:49.441 --> 26:51.844
that she's just itching
to demolish.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.946
-Help.
-I can't.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.347
What?

26:55.381 --> 26:57.950
Only you can really
help yourself out of this.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.218
Okay.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.220
But I'm open to pointers.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.090
Any advice, really. Please.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.393
It sounds like Martha thinks

27:07.426 --> 27:09.361
that you two are going
in the same direction.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.263
She's wrong.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.199
But I can't reason with her.
No one can!

27:13.232 --> 27:15.802
She's Martha.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.705
No, Martha won't
listen to you,

27:18.738 --> 27:21.573
but I bet there's
someone who will

27:21.607 --> 27:23.042
listen to you.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.029
I have to tell you
something,

27:43.062 --> 27:45.097
but I don't want you
to be disappointed in me.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.132
I know.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.036
I lied to you.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.138
About the library.
About everything.

27:52.571 --> 27:53.806
I know.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.510
Well, if you knew that,
then why didn't
you bust me?

27:58.544 --> 28:02.248
Well, some stories
we can tell, and others
need to be told.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.754
And just so you know,

28:07.787 --> 28:09.588
Abigail did help me,

28:11.791 --> 28:14.927
but it was my idea
to go and meet her.

28:14.961 --> 28:15.995
And Nick,

28:17.296 --> 28:19.398
he didn't do anything
but help get me home.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.402
Disappointed?

28:23.435 --> 28:25.637
Well, it's not
your best day...

28:25.671 --> 28:28.307
I really am so sorry.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.676
(SIGHS)

28:30.709 --> 28:33.579
Look, a mistake is
like a bump in the road.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.982
One bump is not so bad.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.317
But if we keep
making mistakes,

28:38.350 --> 28:41.888
eventually we change
the shape
of the road forever.

28:44.090 --> 28:47.126
Nick was actually
really nice to me.
(CHUCKLES)

28:47.894 --> 28:49.395
Surprisingly decent.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.800
Well, that seems like
a story worth telling.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.868
I don't know
what to do.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.637
You will.

29:01.707 --> 29:04.310
So, are you gonna punish me?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.813
Well, looks like
you're washing
and drying tonight.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.882
(CHUCKLES)
Accepted.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.194
Ow!

29:32.304 --> 29:34.273
It doesn't look too bad.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.879
I think I need to do something
about it though.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.481
Maybe I should
see a doctor.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.516
Good thing we have one
right next door.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.987
Would you like me
to go with you?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.023
I have to do this
on my own.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.469
I called your developer
friend to discuss
some other properties,

30:03.502 --> 30:06.973
and he told me that
he is no longer interested
in Keating House.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.841
He said that
you convinced him

30:08.875 --> 30:10.809
to take his business
to Blairsville.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.744
Why?

30:12.778 --> 30:15.982
Because Cassie
got me to see
how to save us both.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.684
I don't need you
to save me,
Mr. Ryan Elliott.

30:18.717 --> 30:21.520
I needed you to do your job.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.123
I did my job,
and I did it well.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.791
And the developer
is very happy,

30:25.824 --> 30:28.360
because Blairsville offers
better tax benefits,

30:28.394 --> 30:30.362
a bigger population

30:30.396 --> 30:32.364
and zero
community resistance.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.166
We don't have any
community resistance.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.536
Yet! Even though you got
the property rezoned...

30:37.569 --> 30:39.338
(WHISPERING)
...nobody in town wants
to see Keating House

30:39.371 --> 30:43.009
torn down and replaced
with modern town homes.

30:43.042 --> 30:46.078
But the whole point
was to bring
more people into town.

30:46.112 --> 30:50.682
But it's the people
living here that should
matter the most.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.552
And face it,
once the town council
got involved,

30:53.585 --> 30:54.921
and they would have
gotten involved,

30:54.954 --> 30:57.256
because there would
have been unhappy citizens

30:57.289 --> 31:00.426
who were wondering
who allowed their quaint
and beautiful town

31:00.459 --> 31:02.394
to be cut up
and re-developed.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.631
And it would not have taken
those people much time

31:05.664 --> 31:08.500
to figure out that
you were at the center
of everything.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.869
-Well, you were too.
-Yes.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.872
-But they can't recall me...
-(GASPS)

31:13.906 --> 31:16.943
Because I'm just a realtor
and you are the mayor.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.978
-Recall?
-Mmm-hmm.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.113
Oh, my heavens!

31:21.147 --> 31:22.214
Mmm.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.717
Martha, we were both wrong,

31:26.785 --> 31:28.087
and now we're both right.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.224
You don't have to thank me.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.629
Well then,
I don't think I will.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.799
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

31:48.540 --> 31:51.377
It doesn't seem
that deep but...

31:51.410 --> 31:53.012
Well, it's good thing
your mom sent you over.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.814
It was.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.951
-No stitches?
-No, just some glue.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.419
Glue?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.888
-Medical grade.
-Oh.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.523
Okay.

32:12.431 --> 32:13.966
Mom didn't send me.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.001
No?

32:16.502 --> 32:17.836
I wanted to come over.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.307
Oh.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.708
I know that Nick's
in trouble.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.244
He is. I'm just glad
he didn't drag you
into his mess.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.113
He didn't drag me.

32:28.847 --> 32:29.982
I dragged him.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.921
I know that Nick
snuck out, but...

32:36.688 --> 32:39.058
He helped me that night.

32:39.091 --> 32:42.528
He got me home safe
and he didn't ask
for anything in return.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.732
I mean, we're not
even friends, really.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.902
He puts on a good show,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.940
but he's not as bad
as he wants everyone
to believe he is.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.675
(SCOFFS) This, I know.

32:59.678 --> 33:03.782
So, should he
still be in trouble

33:03.815 --> 33:06.518
if what his trouble
did ended up
helping someone?

33:08.354 --> 33:09.988
Me?

33:10.022 --> 33:11.257
(SIGHS)

33:30.209 --> 33:31.443
Hi, cuz.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.780
You look very satisfied.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.915
I've done what I came
to Middleton to do.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.417
-Have you?
-Yes.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.652
-And what is that?
-Help.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.157
You've been helping?

33:45.191 --> 33:48.260
Well, I guess it's true
that, uh, you helped Grace

33:48.294 --> 33:51.097
lie to me and sneak out.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.566
I helped Grace realize
that for some people,
like her,

33:54.600 --> 33:58.470
being a rebel is
far more fun in theory
than in practice.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.106
And as a bonus,
I helped Lori too.

34:00.939 --> 34:02.374
Lori?

34:02.408 --> 34:05.944
Lori is now totally renewed
in her very important role

34:05.977 --> 34:07.846
as Grace's big sister
and protector.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.582
And who is Lori
protecting Grace from?

34:10.616 --> 34:11.950
Me.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.952
Oh, well, there's no doubt
that you helped Sam

34:13.985 --> 34:16.388
with his dinner date
with Stephanie.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.191
-Hey, that's on you.
-Excuse me?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.393
Sam doesn't belong
with Stephanie.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.096
And if you hadn't stepped in
and worked your magic
in the kitchen...

34:25.264 --> 34:26.732
And you don't belong
with Ryan.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.067
I tried to help you,

34:29.101 --> 34:31.570
but you're a strong force
to take on, even for me.

34:31.603 --> 34:34.906
You can't control
who ends up with who.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.008
Fate needs to play
its hand out.

34:37.976 --> 34:39.845
Fate needs a little push
from time to time.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.848
A gentle push,
not a forceful shove.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.652
Fate may need
a gentle push, but you,

34:46.685 --> 34:48.854
I think you need a shove
in the right direction.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.023
Look, I'd love
to do this all night,

34:52.057 --> 34:54.092
but I should get to bed.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.262
I start my new job tomorrow.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.630
Stephanie hired me.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.066
You're gonna
help Stephanie?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.801
She's much easier
to help than you.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.672
And what about your job
in New York?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.142
I emailed my boss,
gave notice.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.111
I told him
my family needed me.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.281
(SIGHS)

35:15.314 --> 35:16.715
Stephanie really hired you?

35:18.250 --> 35:19.751
I think it's a case of,

35:19.785 --> 35:22.954
"Keep your friends close
but your enemies closer."

35:23.989 --> 35:25.291
And which are you?

35:34.132 --> 35:35.667
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

35:39.338 --> 35:41.573
I'm just listening to music.
I didn't do anything wrong.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.909
No, I did.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.681
I've been trying
to control you,
and it's not working,

35:49.715 --> 35:52.050
and it's not working
because it's not what
I should be doing,

35:52.083 --> 35:53.919
it's not what you need.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.154
What do I need?

35:56.188 --> 36:00.292
You need me to
help you find a way
to control yourself,

36:00.326 --> 36:02.894
to make better
choices yourself.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.129
What are you
talking about?

36:05.130 --> 36:06.932
(SIGHS) Grace told me
what happened.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.967
At the coffee house.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.202
She said that
you helped her.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.471
It wasn't a big deal.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.306
Why didn't you tell me?

36:21.547 --> 36:23.048
You never would have
believed me.

36:25.617 --> 36:30.021
You just see me
as a screw-up,
or bad, or both.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.328
Wow. That's how you feel?

36:36.362 --> 36:38.230
Well, it's the truth.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.866
(SCOFFS) It's not
even close to the truth.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.001

36:44.770 --> 36:46.137

36:46.972 --> 36:49.341
We came here
to get a fresh start.

36:51.643 --> 36:52.944
Let's try starting over.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.281
Oh, man, how many times
can we start over?

36:56.114 --> 36:57.649
As many as it takes.

37:00.118 --> 37:02.421
But you have
to give a little too.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.123
Can you do that?

37:06.492 --> 37:07.893
Just meet me half way?

37:17.436 --> 37:18.670
Hi.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.040
-Hey, there.
-Hey.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.576
Abigail said that
you weren't home

37:24.610 --> 37:26.645
but then I got your text
saying come around the back.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.079
How did you, uh...

37:29.848 --> 37:31.850
Never mind.
Never mind, I'm here.

37:31.883 --> 37:32.884
Good. Come in.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.086
Thanks.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.356
So, what happened
with the project?

37:37.389 --> 37:40.158
Oh, well, I told Jones
that if he had the mayor

37:40.191 --> 37:42.160
and the zoning on his side,
well, that's one thing,

37:42.193 --> 37:44.095
but if the project really
isn't wanted in Middleton,

37:44.129 --> 37:46.632
and I think we both know
that it's not...

37:46.665 --> 37:48.834
It's not smart business
to anger the community

37:48.867 --> 37:51.069
in which you're trying
to sell something.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.939
I thought that Blairsville
might be a better fit.

37:53.972 --> 37:57.676
They have more money,
less trouble, and he agreed.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.978
So, you lost the deal?

38:00.679 --> 38:02.748
Yes.

38:02.781 --> 38:07.285
But Jones said
that he liked my integrity
and honesty,

38:07.319 --> 38:09.588
so he would like
to work together
on something else.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.022
Sounds win-win.

38:11.890 --> 38:12.958
Thank you.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.560
What did I do?

38:14.593 --> 38:16.462
The same thing
you always do,

38:16.495 --> 38:18.630
you point me
in the right direction.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.033
And even when
I don't want to,

38:22.067 --> 38:24.970
you find a way of
making me see the truth.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.739
You are a good friend.

38:28.707 --> 38:29.941
You too.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.345
Well, I was wondering...

38:33.945 --> 38:35.013
Yes?

38:35.581 --> 38:36.615
Well...

38:38.183 --> 38:42.120
This friend would like
to take you out for dinner.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.591
Well, this friend would like
to accept your offer.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.659
-Yeah?
-Of course.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.761
Wow, that's like
two dinners out in a row.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.063
(CHUCKLES)
We eat out all the time.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.834
Yes. But I was thinking
these last two dinners
were different.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.438
I'm thinking, uh...

39:00.071 --> 39:01.139
You might be right.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.008
Call you tomorrow?

39:04.242 --> 39:05.276
See you tomorrow.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.546
Even better.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.692
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-SAM: Yep?

39:20.726 --> 39:21.893
(DOOR OPENS)

39:30.902 --> 39:33.171
-Hi!
-Oh, hi.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.340
Um, I got your message.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.243
I didn't make the dinner,
but I did clean the kitchen.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.245
All your stuff is right there
on the counter.

39:40.278 --> 39:42.013
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.551
I, uh... I didn't know
you could play guitar.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.386
Oh, yeah. Um,
I used to be in a band.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.755
(PLAYING BLUES RIFF)

39:49.788 --> 39:53.191
I used to have long hair,
really long hair.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.695
And an earring.
(LAUGHING)

39:57.228 --> 39:58.730
Wow.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.966
Um, I don't have
any herb tea,

40:00.999 --> 40:03.735
but I can steep
some oregano for you.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.937
Ooh, tempting,
but I think I'll pass.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.074
Uh, Stephanie called me,

40:09.107 --> 40:10.776
and she told me she had
a really great time.

40:10.809 --> 40:13.612
Oh, your chicken
worked its magic,

40:13.645 --> 40:15.180
date disaster averted.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.615
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

40:16.648 --> 40:18.950
-Thanks.
-Glad I could help.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.418
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:20.452 --> 40:22.187
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.328
Dr. Radford.

40:32.197 --> 40:35.667
Hey. It's been a while.
What's up?

40:37.469 --> 40:39.204
When?

40:39.237 --> 40:40.972
Any particular reason?

40:42.173 --> 40:43.341
What...

40:44.175 --> 40:45.544
Okay.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.581
Yeah, bye.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.256
My ex-wife.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.026
Oh, Is everything okay?

41:02.961 --> 41:05.063
She's coming to Middleton.
