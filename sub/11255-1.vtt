WEBVTT

00:23.148 --> 00:25.108
GOD, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.818
Man:
THANK YOU.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.281
OH, HI, LOWELL.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.951
{\an1}I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THE PLANE.

00:35.034 --> 00:37.328
UH-HUH.

00:37.412 --> 00:41.249
{\an1}PILOTS FEEL SORT OF SPECIAL
ABOUT THEIR PLANES.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.670
INCREDIBLE.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.089
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY

00:48.173 --> 00:51.134
{\an1}BUT IF YOU PUT
YOUR HAND LIKE SO

00:51.217 --> 00:53.136
YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL IT

00:53.219 --> 00:55.346
PUSHING EVER SO
SLIGHTLY UPWARD

00:55.430 --> 00:57.348
LIKE SHE'S STRAINING TO FLY.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.268
I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME HER.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.980
WHEN YOU'RE UP THERE
AND YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN

01:04.063 --> 01:06.274
EVERYTHING SORT OF MAKES SENSE.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.986
{\an1}NOT INTELLECTUALLY,
BUT KIND OF SPIRITUALLY.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.988
IT NEVER FAILS.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.823
EVERY TIME I FLY

01:13.907 --> 01:17.494
{\an1}I COME BACK A LITTLE SURER
THERE'S A GOD.

01:17.577 --> 01:21.206
I GO DOWN TO THE DUMP
AND SHOOT RATS.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.586
THEN YOU DO UNDERSTAND.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.010
Captioning made possible by

01:34.093 --> 01:37.013
{\an1}PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION
and NBC.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.579
{\an4}Woman:
ANNOUNCING THE ARRIVAL
OF SANDPIPER AIR FLIGHT 26

02:42.662 --> 02:45.081
NONSTOP SERVICE FROM BOSTON

02:45.164 --> 02:47.792
{\an1}TO OUR LOVELY ISLAND
OF NANTUCKET.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.253
FOR THOSE PLANNING
TO GREET PASSENGERS

02:50.336 --> 02:54.549
WE'VE LEARNED,
DUE TO A NASTY INCIDENT

02:54.632 --> 02:56.217
IT IS BEST TO WAIT

02:56.301 --> 02:59.888
{\an1}FOR THE PROPELLERS
TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.057
THANKS FOR FLYING
SANDPIPER AIR.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.810
{\an1}FAY, HOW LONG
TILL MY NEXT FLIGHT?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.604
IT'S YOUR AIRLINE, JOE.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.272
YOU CAN LEAVE ANYTIME.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.691
BUT THE SCHEDULE
SAYS SEVEN MINUTES.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.318
YOU HAVE SIX PASSENGERS

03:13.401 --> 03:15.820
AND LOBSTERS TO BE
DELIVERED ALIVE.

03:15.904 --> 03:16.821
THE LOBSTERS.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.114
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE

03:18.197 --> 03:20.575
THE PEOPLE WOULD
APPRECIATE IT, TOO.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.577
I HAVEN'T LOST ONE YET.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.579
I'LL GRAB A QUICK BITE.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.830
Man:
HEY, HACKETT.

03:25.914 --> 03:26.873
WHAT, ROY?

03:26.956 --> 03:29.918
THEY DELIVERED THIS
TO MY AIRLINE BY MISTAKE.

03:30.001 --> 03:30.960
OH, THANKS.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.378
IT'S FROM LAWYERS.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.796
WHAT DID YOU DO?

03:33.880 --> 03:34.964
NOTHING.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.301
YOU PARKED SO CLOSE
TO MY CAR LAST NIGHT

03:38.384 --> 03:41.930
{\an1}I HAD TO CRAWL IN
ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.058
{\an1}THAT GEAR SHIFT
AND I HAD A MOMENT

03:45.141 --> 03:46.309
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.311
WHEN DID YOU GET THIS?

03:48.394 --> 03:49.979
LAST WEEK SOME TIME.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.981
I'M RUNNING A BIG OPERATION.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.859
{\an1}I'VE GOT SIX PLANES,
YOU'VE GOT ONE.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.861
I CAN'T PLAY POST OFFICE.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.237
THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.531
THE DAY YOU GET
IMPORTANT MAIL

04:00.615 --> 04:02.200
I'LL KISS YOUR BEHIND

04:02.283 --> 04:04.953
{\an1}IN THE TOWN SQUARE
AT HIGH NOON.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.163
GIVEN UP ON
DIAL-A-DATES?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.335
HELEN, I'D LIKE A B.L.T.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.505
{\an1}FOUR SLICES OF CRISP BACON,
WHOLE WHEAT

04:15.588 --> 04:18.716
MUSTARD ON TOP,
MAYONNAISE ON THE BOTTOM

04:18.800 --> 04:21.678
{\an1}AND TWO PICKLES
ON THE SIDE.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.721
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I'D ORDER THAT?

04:23.805 --> 04:26.015
YOU ALWAYS ORDER THAT
ON TUESDAY.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.102
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
TODAY HAPPENS TO BE...

04:29.185 --> 04:30.853
WELL, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.481
WHOA.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.899
WHAT YOU GOT?

04:34.983 --> 04:38.736
A LETTER FROM THE LAWYER
HANDLING MY DAD'S ESTATE.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.572
{\an1}HE WAS INSTRUCTED
TO SEND ME THIS PACKAGE.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.740
{\an3}OPEN IT.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.075
THERE'S A CATCH.

04:44.158 --> 04:47.829
{\an1}I'M ONLY SUPPOSED TO OPEN IT
WITH MY BROTHER.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.205
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.373
{\an1}WHAT?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.375
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CALL HIM.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.543
YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN

04:53.626 --> 04:54.544
FOR SIX YEARS.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.878
THAT'S A LONG GRUDGE

04:55.962 --> 04:57.964
MAYBE FOR THE AVERAGE
PERSON.

04:58.047 --> 04:59.966
I DO NOT HOLD A GRUDGE.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.720
YOU'VE SAID THAT ABOUT ME
SINCE WE WERE KIDS

05:03.803 --> 05:05.221
AND QUITE FRANKLY

05:05.304 --> 05:07.056
I'VE ALWAYS RESENTED IT.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.892
IT'S TIME YOU GOT
OVER THE FACT

05:09.976 --> 05:14.731
{\an1}THAT CAROL THE PIG DUMPED YOU
AND MARRIED YOUR BROTHER.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.734
CAROL IS NOT A PIG
AND I AM OVER IT.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.403
{\an1}I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A BROTHER.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.738
HE'S MORE LIKE

05:21.821 --> 05:23.072
A PIECE OF POPCORN

05:23.156 --> 05:25.742
STUCK BETWEEN MY TEETH
FOR 28 YEARS.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.243
I WENT MY WAY.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.536
BRIAN WENT HIS.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.537
WITH A PIG.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.872
STOP SAYING THAT.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.041
I WILL IF YOU CALL.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.460
HOW OLD WAS I WHEN I MOVED HERE?

05:35.543 --> 05:36.919
TEN. WHY?

05:37.003 --> 05:40.423
{\an1}WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS LONG ENOUGH
THAT I CAN SAY

05:40.506 --> 05:42.091
CALL YOUR BROTHER, BUTTHEAD!

05:46.679 --> 05:49.098
ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL HIM.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.933
{\an1}Fay:
GOOD FOR YOU.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.268
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT

05:52.351 --> 05:55.563
WHETHER YOUR BROTHER
MARRIED A PIG OR NOT.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.565
SHE IS NOT A PIG.

05:57.648 --> 06:01.277
{\an1}IT'S IMPORTANT TO HONOR
YOUR FATHER'S LAST WORDS.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.737
I'M NOT HONORING

06:02.820 --> 06:05.073
HIS LAST WORDS,
BUT HIS WISHES.

06:05.156 --> 06:08.743
HIS LAST WORDS WERE
"SIT ON MY LAP, EYDIE."

06:08.826 --> 06:11.412
HE THOUGHT I WAS EYDIE GORME.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.125
I DON'T KNOW.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.296
{\an1}I GAVE IT A SHOT
AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

06:20.379 --> 06:23.633
DEBORAH NORVILLE DOESN'T
HAVE THE HUMANITY

06:23.716 --> 06:25.218
JANE PAULEY HAD.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.511
SHE'S GONE, ROY.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.888
WE GO THROUGH THIS
EVERY DAY.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.100
JANE HAD 13 GOOD YEARS,
BUT SHE'S GONE.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.434
GET OVER IT.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.312
{\an1}I KNOW THAT UP HERE,
DOGGONE IT

06:36.395 --> 06:40.274
{\an1}BUT HOW DO YOU FILL
THE VOID IN HERE?

06:40.358 --> 06:42.193
HOW ABOUT A JELLY DONUT?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.528
{\an1}JANE WHO?

06:43.611 --> 06:47.365
{\an1}I'M LOOKING FOR THE OWNER
OF AEROMASS AIRLINES.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.700
I'VE GOT TO SHAKE HIS HAND.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.619
OH, THAT WOULD BE ME.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.538
ROY BIGGINS.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.164
AND YOU ARE, UH..?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.290
CALL ME BRIAN.

06:56.374 --> 07:00.753
I JUST FLEW ONE OF YOUR FLIGHTS
AND YOU ARE A GENIUS.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.380
I AM?

07:02.463 --> 07:04.799
{\an1}I'VE HEARD OF
CREATIVE COST-CUTTING

07:04.882 --> 07:06.217
BUT NO LIFE JACKETS--

07:06.300 --> 07:07.343
IT'S INSPIRED.

07:07.426 --> 07:10.221
{\an1}SURE, TELL THEM
THEY'RE UNDER THE SEAT

07:10.304 --> 07:11.556
BUT NOBODY CHECKS.

07:11.639 --> 07:12.557
THEY'RE THERE.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.808
SURE THEY ARE.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.351
AND GETTING A PILOT

07:15.434 --> 07:17.478
FRESH OUT OF FLIGHT SCHOOL

07:17.562 --> 07:19.397
SAVED YOU A BUNDLE.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.691
{\an1}WE HAD DRINKS
BEFORE THE FLIGHT.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.026
{\an1}TOO BAD ABOUT
THAT EYE OPERATION

07:24.110 --> 07:28.030
{\an1}BUT HOW OFTEN DO YOU
HAVE TO LOOK LEFT ANYWAY?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.657
FOLKS, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.368
YOU'VE MANAGED
TO SLIP IN UNNOTICED.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.579
JOEY!

07:34.662 --> 07:36.247
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.582
I'M AFRAID SO.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.083
HE'S MY BROTHER.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.751
ROY BIGGINS, BRIAN HACKETT.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.044
SANSABELT SLACKS.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
MISS ONE ISSUE OF <i> G.Q.</i>

07:43.754 --> 07:46.549
AND THE FASHION WORLD

07:46.632 --> 07:48.217
JUST PASSES YOU BY.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.220
KEEP THIS GUY AWAY FROM ME.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.097
FOLKS, FOLKS...

07:55.850 --> 07:58.394
OH, IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, JOE.

07:58.477 --> 07:59.395
YEAH.

07:59.478 --> 08:00.396
YEAH.

08:00.479 --> 08:01.564
HOW YOU BEEN?

08:01.647 --> 08:02.732
FINE. AND YOU?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.026
"FINE. AND YOU? FINE. AND YOU?"

08:05.109 --> 08:06.694
PLEASE, TOO MUCH WARMTH.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.237
{\an3}YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.198
THIS PLACE NEVER CHANGES.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.283
YOU LOOK A LITTLE TIRED.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.367
I'M FINE.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.577
I KNOW YOU.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.704
YOU'RE THE BEST PILOT AROUND

08:16.787 --> 08:18.706
BUT YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.084
{\an1}KEEP THIS UP, YOU'LL END UP
LIKE HOWARD HUGHES--

08:22.168 --> 08:25.421
LOCKED IN A HOTEL ROOM,
SITTING ON KLEENEX

08:25.504 --> 08:28.382
{\an1}SUCKING APPLE SAUCE
THROUGH A STRAW.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.885
ALL THAT MONEY
AND HIS HOBBIES

08:30.968 --> 08:32.761
ARE THE SAME AS MINE.

08:32.845 --> 08:35.139
REALLY?

08:37.892 --> 08:41.102
HE ALSO COLLECTED TOENAIL
CLIPPINGS IN A MASON JAR.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.774
THIS IS UNCANNY.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.942
WHO'S THAT?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.986
{\an1}THAT'S LOWELL,
OUR JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.907
{\an1}HIS FAMILY LIVED ON THE ISLAND
FOR FIVE GENERATIONS.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.909
PROBABLY IN THE SAME ROOM.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.538
{\an3}LET'S GET STARTED
AND SEE WHAT POP LEFT US?

08:58.621 --> 09:00.081
BRIAN!

09:00.164 --> 09:01.415
HELEN?

09:01.499 --> 09:02.833
HELEN CHAPPEL?

09:02.917 --> 09:03.376
OH, MY GOD!

09:03.459 --> 09:05.169
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.630
YOU'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.925
MAYBE A POUND OR TWO, OR 60.

09:11.008 --> 09:11.926
HEY.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.177
COME ON, BRIAN.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.220
HELEN'S BUSY.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.179
IT'S OKAY.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.847
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

09:16.931 --> 09:18.182
I'M IN THE CARIBBEAN

09:18.266 --> 09:20.977
{\an1}FLYING CHARTER
FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.311
BUSINESS IS PICKING UP.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.605
{\an1}ALTHOUGH THE NORIEGA
SPRING BARBECUE

09:24.689 --> 09:25.982
LOOKS A LITTLE IFFY.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.942
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

09:28.025 --> 09:30.611
YOUR CELLO WAS GETTING YOU OUT.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.823
IT WILL. I PRACTICE
AND GO TO MY AUDITIONS.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.825
IN THE MEANTIME, I'M HERE.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.868
BRIAN, NOW.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.537
JOEY...

09:39.620 --> 09:41.706
YOU AND HELEN, YOU KNOW?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.040
OF COURSE NOT.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.375
WE'RE FRIENDS.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.043
LOOK AT THAT BODY.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.670
SHE'S PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.298
{\an1}SHE'S LIKE
A BABY SISTER.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.632
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.343
IT'S TIME I GAVE HER A BATH.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.305
OH, SAME OLD JOE,
NEAT AS A PIN.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.307
EVERYTHING AT RIGHT ANGLES.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.310
IT'S CALLED HAVING
YOUR LIFE IN ORDER.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.644
TRY IT SOMETIME.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.942
SO... HOW'S CAROL?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.736
FINE, FINE.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.321
SENDS HER LOVE.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.701
ABOUT CAROL, ARE WE OKAY HERE?

10:21.329 --> 10:24.415
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT

10:24.498 --> 10:26.125
YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.877
I'M OKAY.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.586
I'M OKAY.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.253
OKAY.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.921
THAT WAS FUN.

10:33.632 --> 10:34.592
HERE.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.093
OUR LEGACY FROM POP.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.055
{\an3}ONE OF HIS GET-RICH-QUICK
SCHEMES PAID OFF.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.723
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.266
I'M VERY SERIOUS, JOE.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.851
POP WAS LOADED.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.353
WHAT MAKES YOU

10:45.436 --> 10:46.520
THINK THAT?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
THE PHONE CALL.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.647
{\an1}WHAT CALL?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.024
OH, DEAR.

10:50.107 --> 10:54.403
{\an1}YOU HAVE A SIGN ON THIS DRAWER
THAT SAYS "EMPTY."

10:54.487 --> 10:56.405
YOU CAN'T PULL IT OPEN

10:56.489 --> 10:57.865
AND SEE THAT?

10:57.948 --> 10:59.533
WHAT PHONE CALL?

10:59.617 --> 11:02.745
{\an1}YOU ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME
TO LABEL IT?

11:02.828 --> 11:06.248
DOES THE WORD "ANAL"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

11:06.332 --> 11:12.213
{\an1}AT THIS MOMENT,
IT HAS A VERY SPECIAL MEANING.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.798
THIS HURTS ME, JOE.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.633
THIS REALLY HURTS ME.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.885
THINK IT'LL LEAVE A MARK?

11:17.968 --> 11:19.095
WHAT PHONE CALL?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.263
HE CALLED A COUPLE MONTHS

11:21.347 --> 11:22.598
BEFORE HE DIED

11:22.681 --> 11:25.935
AND RAMBLED ON
ABOUT THIS AND THAT.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.563
{\an1}I REMEMBER HIM SAYING
DISTINCTLY, "YOU'RE RICH."

11:29.647 --> 11:32.441
{\an1}I DIDN'T THINK
MUCH OF IT UNTIL NOW.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.443
DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.780
DAD WAS GETTING STRANGE
THOSE LAST FEW YEARS.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.614
WHAT?

11:38.697 --> 11:39.949
HE'D PUT ON AN APRON

11:40.032 --> 11:42.952
{\an1}AND GO TO THE MARKET
AND DEMONSTRATE CHEESE SPREAD.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.995
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THAT.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
SURE, BUT USUALLY

11:46.872 --> 11:48.958
THE MARKET HIRES THEM.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.293
THIS IS IT, PAY DAY.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.505
YOU'RE SETTING YOURSELF UP
FOR A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.424
YE OF LITTLE FAITH.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.470
IT'S A KEY.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.847
I TOLD YOU.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.890
TO A SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX

12:04.974 --> 12:08.185
{\an1}IN THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK
OF NANTUCKET.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.271
WE'RE RICH!

12:10.354 --> 12:11.480
WE'RE RICH!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.149
WE'RE RICH!
WE'RE RICH!

12:14.400 --> 12:16.026
WARM UP THE CAR.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.487
I'VE GOT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.947
WE'RE RICH!

12:21.574 --> 12:23.826
BE THERE, PLEASE.

12:23.909 --> 12:24.827
OH!

12:24.910 --> 12:27.329
WAIT FOR THE BEEP.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.998
HI, CAROL, IT'S ME.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.960
{\an1}THE JUDGE TOLD ME
NOT TO BOTHER YOU ANYMORE...

12:33.043 --> 12:34.295
OR HIM, EITHER.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.297
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW

12:36.380 --> 12:38.966
I'M ABOUT TO COME
INTO SOME MONEY.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.678
{\an1}IF YOU'RE READY TO COME BACK,
THE DOOR'S OPEN.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.680
I MISS YOU, CAROL

12:44.763 --> 12:48.142
AND I REALLY WANT YOU TO KNOW...

12:48.225 --> 12:51.937
GREAT. NOW HER MACHINE'S
HANGING UP ON ME.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.110
THIS WILL KILL HIM.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.662
STAND BACK, CLEAR THE DECK.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.498
RICH GUYS COMING THROUGH.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.665
WHAT DID YOU GET?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.000
THIS WAS IN THE BOX

13:13.083 --> 13:15.002
BUT THERE WAS NO WAY
TO GET IN.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.670
GIVE ME A SCREWDRIVER.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.380
OKAY, BUT BE CAREFUL.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.925
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT ON ANTIHISTAMINES,
ARE YOU?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.390
IT'S ANOTHER KEY.

13:28.474 --> 13:32.061
I MEAN THIS
IN THE NICEST POSSIBLE WAY

13:32.144 --> 13:35.314
BUT YOUR FATHER WAS
REALLY JERKING YOU AROUND.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.567
THIS ONE'S TO A POST OFFICE BOX
IN BOSTON.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.236
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.780
THIS SEEMS LIKE A WASTE OF TIME.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.908
{\an1}REMEMBER, DAD SAID,
"YOU'RE RICH."

13:45.991 --> 13:49.286
{\an1}I DO HAVE A FLIGHT
FOR BOSTON IN A FEW MINUTES.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.915
{\an1}WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.124
HO! MAJOR HOOTERS.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.334
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:55.417 --> 14:00.130
MAJOR <i> BOB</i> HOOTERS,
U.S. AIR FORCE, AT YOUR SERVICE.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.840
UH-OH, SCRAMBLE.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.008
RED ALERT.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.845
REST EASY TONIGHT, LITTLE LADY,
OUR BOYS ARE IN THE AIR.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.979
{\an3}I HATE TO SAY
"I TOLD YOU SO."

14:15.062 --> 14:16.230
DON'T START.

14:16.313 --> 14:19.441
{\an1}I SPENT FIVE HOURS
ON SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE

14:19.525 --> 14:21.443
AND WHAT DO WE END UP WITH?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.612
EXCUSE ME,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.948
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

14:26.031 --> 14:29.785
JUST SIT BACK
AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.955
NANTUCKET TOWER,
THIS IS SANDPIPER 28.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.957
FINAL APPROACH FIX INCOMING.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.792
Sandpiper 28, Nantucket.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.460
You're clear to land.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.795
SANDPIPER 28, ROGER.

14:39.878 --> 14:42.798
LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET UPSET.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.633
I WANT TO GET UPSET.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.969
{\an1}GETTING UPSET
MAKES ME HAPPY.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.470
TRY IT SOME TIME.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.306
YOU SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.307
OF COURSE.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.475
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE LOST ANYTHING.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.644
WE HAVE A LOT
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.979
WE'VE GOT...

14:57.062 --> 14:59.440
IF YOU SAY "HEALTH,"
I'LL HURT YOU.

14:59.523 --> 15:03.152
I WASN'T GOING
TO SAY THAT.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.654
ALTHOUGH WE DO.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.449
I WAS GOING TO SAY
WE'VE GOT OUR JOBS.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.326
{\an3}I'VE STILL
GOT THE AIRLINE.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.328
YOU'RE STILL
FLYING CHARTER.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.998
YOU DO STILL FLY
FOR THAT CHARTER COMPANY?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.166
YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

15:17.249 --> 15:18.167
YOU GOT CANNED.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.377
IT WAS A CRUMMY JOB ANYWAY.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.631
{\an1}I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT NEED
AN EXTRA PILOT.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.633
ARE YOU KIDDING? HIRE YOU?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.843
I'D RATHER CRASH THIS PLANE.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.345
YOU NEED A JOB?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.347
I'LL HIRE YOU.

15:35.726 --> 15:39.146
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO BLOW
EVERY SINGLE OPPORTUNITY

15:39.229 --> 15:40.314
YOU'VE EVER HAD?

15:40.397 --> 15:41.690
IT'S A GIFT.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.567
A FREE RIDE TO PRINCETON

15:43.651 --> 15:45.027
AND YOU QUIT.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.739
{\an1}ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PEOPLE
ACCEPTED TO THE SPACE PROGRAM

15:48.822 --> 15:51.158
AND YOU WASH OUT
ON THE SECOND DAY.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.369
YOU COULD HAVE
BEEN AN ASTRONAUT.

15:53.452 --> 15:57.414
{\an1}YOU COULDN'T BRING DATES
INTO THE SHUTTLE SIMULATOR.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.209
{\an1}I WISH I'D HAD THE ADVANTAGES
YOU HAD.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.503
SOMEONE HAD TO HOLD
DOWN THE FORT.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.171
THEY'VE DONE THIS MOVIE.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.883
REMEMBER WHERE JIMMY STEWART
STAYS HOME TO SAVE THE BANK

16:07.966 --> 16:10.511
WHILE HIS BROTHER GOES
AND DOES THINGS?

16:10.594 --> 16:12.221
<i>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:15.724
{\an1}FROM WHERE I SIT,
JIMMY STEWART WAS A SAP.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.850
Sandpiper 28...

16:16.934 --> 16:18.727
{\an1}GIVE US A SECOND,
WILL YOU?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.355
{\an1}HE COULD HAVE LEFT,
AND SO COULD YOU.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.024
{\an1}BUT YOU STAYED HOME
AND TOOK CARE OF POP.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.526
STOP IT RIGHT THERE.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.819
EXCUSE ME...

16:26.902 --> 16:29.571
{\an1}YOU DON'T EVEN TEAR
THAT TAG OFF THE MATTRESS.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.490
IT SAYS, "DO NOT REMOVE."

16:31.573 --> 16:32.700
EXCUSE ME...

16:32.783 --> 16:34.535
YOU USED POP AS AN EXCUSE.

16:34.618 --> 16:38.747
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO GO OUT AND DO WHAT I DID.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.082
FALL ON YOUR FACE?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.917
I WASN'T AFRAID OF FAILING.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.210
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.211
EXCUSE ME.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.212
WHAT?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.172
WEREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO LAND?

16:47.798 --> 16:49.091
OH.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.384
I'M THE PILOT

16:50.467 --> 16:53.554
AND I'LL DECIDE WHEN
TO LAND THIS AIRCRAFT.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.888
OKAY, NOW.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.608
Brian:
OBNOXIOUS LITTLE TWERP.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.608
CONTROL FREAK.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.278
YOU'RE A BONE IN MY THROAT.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.280
I SHOULD HAVE
SMOTHERED YOU.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.614
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.616
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.785
THAT KEY OPENED
A SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX

17:16.868 --> 17:18.996
WHICH HAD A KEY
FOR ANOTHER BANK.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.789
WHICH LED TO ANOTHER BANK

17:20.873 --> 17:24.752
{\an1}WHICH LED TO TWO BUS STATIONS,
A TRAIN DEPOT, AND A KENNEL.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.627
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE FOUND?

17:26.712 --> 17:27.628
ANOTHER KEY.

17:27.713 --> 17:28.797
I'LL TELL YOU

17:28.881 --> 17:30.132
WHERE IT GOES.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.134
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOES.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.761
<i>THAT'S</i> WHERE IT GOES.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.598
AND WHAT DO
I END UP WITH?

17:37.681 --> 17:40.184
<i>NADA,</i> ZIPPO, ZERO, ZILCH.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.686
I END UP WITH NOTHING.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.230
YOU'VE GOT CAROL.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.318
OH, SO NOW WE GET TO IT, HUH?

17:49.401 --> 17:54.990
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE OVER THAT.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.825
OVER STEALING MY LOVE?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.993
I DIDN'T STEAL HER.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.286
SHE CAME AFTER ME.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.873
{\an1}CAROL DOESN'T HAVE
A DECEPTIVE BONE IN HER BODY.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.127
SHE'S KIND AND GOOD AND HONEST.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.963
{\an1}AND YOU STOLE HER FROM ME,
AND IT HURTS.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.298
IT HURTS BAD.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.176
I DON'T THINK YOU COULD
EVER KNOW HOW MUCH.

18:14.259 --> 18:19.515
SHE LEFT ME FOR ANOTHER GUY.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.016
SHE LEFT YOU, TOO?

18:21.099 --> 18:22.017
YEAH.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.729
THAT <i> PIG?!</i>

18:25.813 --> 18:29.525
OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.986
BUT SHE WAS <i> MY</i> PIG.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.572
AT LEAST THE OTHER GUY
WASN'T YOUR BROTHER.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.076
MY BROTHER WOULD NEVER
HAVE DONE THAT TO ME.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.916
I THOUGHT IF POP LEFT US MONEY,
SHE MIGHT COME BACK.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.379
HEY, LISTEN, JOE.

18:50.462 --> 18:54.883
NO MATTER WHOSE FAULT IT WAS,
IF LOSING CAROL MADE YOU FEEL

18:54.967 --> 18:57.386
THE WAY I'VE FELT
SINCE SHE'S LEFT

18:57.469 --> 19:00.138
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.104
WELL...

19:07.187 --> 19:09.231
PLACES TO GO, PEOPLE TO SEE.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.441
BYE!

19:11.525 --> 19:12.901
GET ME TO MOROCCO.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.070
WE'VE GOT ONE GOING
TO HARTFORD.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.071
CLOSE ENOUGH.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.906
OFFERING THAT MAN A JOB

19:17.990 --> 19:20.993
{\an1}WOULD BE THE STUPIDEST THING
I COULD DO.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.911
HE'S TOTALLY UNRELIABLE.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.746
HE'D NEVER BE ON TIME.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.206
WHY ARE YOU
GOING TO?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.251
I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.881
UH, BRIAN?

19:33.964 --> 19:37.050
IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED
IN WORKING WITH ME

19:37.134 --> 19:39.386
I COULD ALWAYS USE
A GOOD PILOT.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.054
THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.390
{\an1}BUT I DON'T TAKE JOBS
OUT OF PITY.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.391
TAKE IT EASY.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.601
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.769
LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.313
I'LL TRY TO.

19:49.396 --> 19:53.442
{\an1}I DON'T WANT TO END UP SITTING
ON HOWARD HUGHES' KLEENEX.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.485
(<i> chuckling</i> )

19:55.569 --> 19:59.489
JOE HACKETT, ONE OF THE WORLD'S
TRUE FUNNYMEN.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.576
SEE YOU AROUND, BAGGY PANTS.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.328
SAY, I RECOGNIZE THIS KEY.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.954
IT OPENS OUR LOCKERS.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.831
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.958
HEY, LOWELL, SEE IF THIS FITS

20:10.042 --> 20:12.544
NUMBER FIVE.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.088
HANG ON, MOM.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.969
THERE'S A SUITCASE. WANT IT?

20:21.053 --> 20:21.970
YES.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.809
I'D LIKE IT NOTED

20:27.893 --> 20:30.062
THIS SCRATCH
WAS ON THE SUITCASE.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.522
LOWELL!
LOWELL!

20:32.606 --> 20:34.983
ALL RIGHT.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.152
OKAY.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.487
NOW, REMEMBER, BRIAN

20:38.570 --> 20:41.365
{\an3}WHATEVER'S IN THIS SUITCASE,
WE SPLIT IN TWO.

20:41.448 --> 20:45.160
WHAT IF IT'S A PUPPY?

20:45.243 --> 20:48.997
{\an3}BRIAN, IT'S BEEN
A LONG DAY.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.666

WILD GOOSE CHASE...

21:29.913 --> 21:31.164
DAD JUST WANTED US

21:31.248 --> 21:33.083
TO SPEND SOME
TIME TOGETHER.

21:33.166 --> 21:37.045
{\an1}YEAH, I GUESS MAYBE DAD
