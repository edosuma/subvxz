puts it at a week ago.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.818
He's alive.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.298
Am I missing something?

11:31.168 --> 11:32.648
We killed Sahar.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.867
She was dead on the floor.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.303
Yeah, and all of her people

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
were rounded up by INTERPOL.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.698
Yeah, so who's this guy
that's got Adam?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
Okay, let's go.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.227
Come to mama.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.055
Give me a match.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.231
Yeah, light it up.Jimmy, what the...

11:50.274 --> 11:51.798
Ooh!

11:51.841 --> 11:54.888
How long have you
been sitting there?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.759
I don't know--
maybe ten minutes?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.892
Gibbs and Ziva are meeting
with the team upstairs,

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
and I... I thought
that their next stop

12:00.328 --> 12:01.764
would definitely be here.
I am definitely

12:01.808 --> 12:04.767
not missing out
on seeing Ziva again.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.856
Maybe you could say hi
next time instead of lurking

12:06.900 --> 12:08.902
in the corner
like a evil leprechaun.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.251
Got an update?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.906
-Ziva! [laughing]
-[grunts]

12:12.949 --> 12:14.429
Good to see you, Jimmy.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.039
Not now.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.476
Right, you got an
important mission.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.783
Ziva, the myth, the legend--
pleasure to meet you.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.045
I have stuff for you.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.830
I'm all eardrums.Huh?

12:23.873 --> 12:26.789
Just go on.Okay. So, facial recognition

12:26.833 --> 12:29.792
is up and running
on Adam's captor, and this,

12:29.836 --> 12:32.490
as you know, is Adam and his
captor walking into a building

12:32.534 --> 12:34.492
about a week ago.
I was able to clean up

12:34.536 --> 12:36.799
a reflection in one
of the windows.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.409
Get us the location
of the building.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.238
Was it a reflection
of a street sign or...?

12:41.282 --> 12:43.414
Please, that would've
been too easy.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.851
No, the reflection was of

12:44.894 --> 12:46.809
half a number
on a utility pole transformer.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.725
So I was able to use that
plus the direction of the sun

12:49.769 --> 12:51.422
to triangulate a...Got an address?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.033
Oh, are you
seriously not gonna,

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
like, let me explain
how I did this?

12:56.210 --> 12:58.516
Okay.
It's an

12:58.560 --> 13:00.823
old factory set for demolition.
Oof.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.607
Looks like the building
is barely standing.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.739
Thank you, Kasie.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.871
Get us the address.

13:04.914 --> 13:05.872
Update the team.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.830
And I want an ID on that guy.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.572
Okay, explain
the eardrums thing.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.238
There's no one here.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.331
Hey, McGee.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.419
We got nothing.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.637
We'll canvass the area.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.205
We'll get back to you.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.860
There were several buildings
half a mile back.[music playing in distance]

13:37.904 --> 13:39.949
Perhaps someone
saw something that...

14:01.405 --> 14:03.581
[music continues playing]

14:25.255 --> 14:27.040
[music stops]MAN: Help. Here.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.172
ZIVA:
Adam.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.740
I'm here.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.872
[wheezing]

14:32.915 --> 14:35.352
Sahar. Sahar...

14:36.484 --> 14:38.312
Sahar...

14:38.355 --> 14:39.487
No, no, no, no, no.

14:39.530 --> 14:40.923
She's dead.
It's over.

14:40.967 --> 14:41.968
No.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.926
The woman was a decoy.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.058
What woman?

14:45.101 --> 14:46.886
The woman you killed.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.064
The real Sahar is alive.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.326
Who is she?

14:52.369 --> 14:53.457
Where is she, Adam?

14:53.501 --> 14:54.981
You know her.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.332
You know her.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.986
Adam, how do I know her?

15:00.029 --> 15:00.900
Adam?

15:00.943 --> 15:03.119
Adam?[grunts]

15:03.163 --> 15:05.121
He's breathing.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.993
We need to get him out of here.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.864
GIBBS:
I don't have a key for this.
Where's the key?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.702
Got 'em.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.226
[creaking]

15:23.270 --> 15:24.749
Uh-oh.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.334
ADAM:
You see, there she is.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.771
I observed her from afar
the entire journey.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.382
[short laugh]

15:48.425 --> 15:49.992
She cried on the plane
with Orli,

15:50.036 --> 15:51.385
But once she saw Tony

15:51.428 --> 15:54.301
there were no
more tears.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.004
He put her in a stroller
and took her to the park, huh?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.179
[short laugh]

16:04.615 --> 16:06.052
You must take these

16:06.095 --> 16:08.358
and destroy them,
Adam, please.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.710
I cannot bring myself to do it.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.583
The panic?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.894
It comes and goes
after I left Tali.

16:22.938 --> 16:26.072
But Tali's safety is not
the only thing I worry about.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.510
Tony's gonna
come looking for me.

16:29.553 --> 16:30.728
Of that, I'm certain.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.122
So will Gibbs.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.689
They believe the story.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.213
They believe
you are dead.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.918
Ziva, we will
work together.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.616
We will find this threat
against you,

16:48.659 --> 16:50.705
and we will neutralize it.

16:55.231 --> 16:58.756
GIBBS:
Ziva, wake up.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.540
Ziva, you all right?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.020
Hey, you okay?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.282
Yeah.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.935
You all right?I'm okay, yeah.

17:03.979 --> 17:04.980
What happened?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.330
We fell through.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.202
Adam. Adam!

17:09.245 --> 17:10.855
We need to get back up there.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.248
No, there's nothing
to hang on to.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.380
There's no
climbing out.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.642
Oh...

17:14.685 --> 17:17.384
What about
your cell phone?

17:17.427 --> 17:19.603
Eh, there's no cell reception.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.214
Well, then tell me
how to get out of here, Gibbs.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
He's dying up there.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.652
There's a staircase
back there.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.871
There's a door behind
all this stuff.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.048
You've got to be kidding me.
There's no time.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.484
Who knows how long
it'll take us

17:30.527 --> 17:31.833
to move all this stuff
out of the way

17:31.876 --> 17:34.357
or if we'll even be
able to do it at all.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.708
Look.
[grunts]

17:37.752 --> 17:39.406
Hey. Hey, hey!
Hold up!

17:39.449 --> 17:41.538
No, that's-that's
a load-bearing beam.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.410
The beam above
it is rotted.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.499
This whole place
is rotted to hell.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.109
Okay, but if we knock
out this pole,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.719
the entire structure will
collapse, and then we can

17:48.763 --> 17:50.547
just climb up the rubble.No, no.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.636
If it collapses, we'll be
dead underneath it.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.290
We can take cover
in the shaft.No.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.813
We won't have time
to get there.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.120
I can't let him die
up there alone, Gibbs.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.514
What about Sahar?

18:00.557 --> 18:02.690
You can't protect
your daughter from her

18:02.733 --> 18:04.648
if you are down here...

18:04.692 --> 18:05.736
dead.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.740
Adam said I knew Sahar.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.919
But I don't know who she is.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.400
Manual labor.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.663
It'll help you think.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.715
We got ourselves
a match, baby.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.326
Meet Adam Eshel's captor.Who is he?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.676
TORRES:
He's a gun-for-hire,
wanted in eight countries.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.852
Born in England, though
that's up for debate.

18:34.896 --> 18:38.247
Mossad says he's from Belgium,
MI6 claims he's Croatian.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.857
Does he have a name?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.946
MCGEE:
Got an alias-- Gabriel Cross.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.600
This guy is very
into aliases.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.820
Kasie made a list of
the ones we know of.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.778
So, basically we don't
know who this dude is.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.432
It's gonna take forever
to go through these names

18:49.476 --> 18:50.781
to figure out
who hired him.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.479
Gibbs' phone went
straight to voice mail.

18:52.522 --> 18:55.177
Well, he and Ziva are canvassing
the area around the factory.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.875
Could be reception's
just spotty out there.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.488
[grunting]

19:01.531 --> 19:02.837
Pull.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.664
Come on.[shouts]

19:03.707 --> 19:05.100
It's meaningless.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.101
It's no use.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
We'll never move this thing.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.019
Adam!

19:12.977 --> 19:15.719
Okay, you can take cover
or you can help me.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.852
Ziva.Look, we tried it your way

19:17.895 --> 19:19.549
and it didn't work.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.724
I'm gonna knock down this pole.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.248
And I'm gonna take cover, okay?

19:22.291 --> 19:23.510
Will you just listen to me?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.685
Our muscles are burnt out.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.861
Give them a minute
to recover,

19:26.904 --> 19:28.558
and then we can
move this thing.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.865
Gibbs, he doesn't have a minute.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.347
You're gonna...
Come on.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.349
Tell me about Tali.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.611
What?

19:37.654 --> 19:38.960
[chuckles]

19:40.309 --> 19:41.963
Tell me about her.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.360
Oh...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.537
She hates Band-Aids.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.413
After Tony
left NCIS with Tali,

19:57.457 --> 19:59.415
he tracked me down in Cairo.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.374
He found me.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.985
Since then I've told him
only what he needed to know.

20:04.028 --> 20:07.945
We've had very little contact.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
So, Cairo was

20:09.817 --> 20:12.167
the last time I held...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
Tali.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.220
She had this, uh...

20:21.263 --> 20:23.918
little scrape on her knee.

20:23.961 --> 20:26.573
Oh, she hates Band-Aids.
[laughs]

20:26.616 --> 20:28.792
So...

20:28.836 --> 20:32.187
Tony got her to wear one

20:32.231 --> 20:35.843
by cutting it
into the shape of a heart.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.325
When I saw this,
I... I just knew

20:39.368 --> 20:41.544
he would watch over her.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.807
He would keep her safe.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.423
But Adam has kept her safe, too.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.252
By watching over me.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.042
Let's get him out of here.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
On three.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.004
One, two, three, go.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.790
[both grunting]

21:09.833 --> 21:12.009
[exclaims]

21:17.537 --> 21:19.321
Adam.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.931
He doesn't have a pulse.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.544
[grunts]

21:24.587 --> 21:26.981
Come on, fight.
Fight, Adam.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.375
Come on, stay with me,
stay with me.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.767
Fight.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.116
[grunting]

21:32.160 --> 21:33.683
Ziva.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.076
Call an ambulance.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.947
Stay with me.Hey.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.036
Stop it.

21:39.080 --> 21:39.907
[grunts]

21:39.950 --> 21:41.996
Call an ambulance, Gibbs!

21:42.039 --> 21:44.172
He's gone.
He's gone.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.739
[grunts]

22:04.584 --> 22:05.628
Hey, you all right?

22:05.672 --> 22:06.890
Oh, I've been better.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.501
We've gone back
through everything

22:08.544 --> 22:09.806
that we had on Sahar.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.853
Gibbs.Boss, you okay? Ziva okay?

22:12.896 --> 22:14.681
How'd we get this wrong?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.640
Somebody tell me how
the woman we killed

22:17.684 --> 22:18.989
ended up some kind of fake.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.513
Well, we got
part of it right.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.254
The real Sahar was
in a Syrian POW camp

22:23.298 --> 22:24.995
before Ziva's
farmhouse exploded.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.911
And none of our sources ever
had a real description of her.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.217
BISHOP:
But when we went
through the chatter

22:29.260 --> 22:31.872
with this person in mind,
we found two mentions

22:31.915 --> 22:33.395
of a woman
who aided Sahar's escape.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.137
McGEE:
She was described
as "dark hair, small in stature,

22:36.180 --> 22:37.617
but sure of herself
in weaponry."

22:37.660 --> 22:38.835
TORRES:
We also have lots

22:38.879 --> 22:40.054
of sources that
say that Sahar

22:40.097 --> 22:41.360
has been at two
places at once

22:41.403 --> 22:42.578
over the years.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.058
That's what made her
so hard to track.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.973
BISHOP:
And because no one knew
what she looked like,

22:46.016 --> 22:48.584
we think she had a habit of
having her minions pose as her.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.413
That's how she was able to keep
her locations under wraps.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.634
Take down the picture.

22:54.677 --> 22:55.939
Take it down.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.767
I want to know
who the real Sahar is,

22:57.811 --> 23:00.379
and where she is now.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.381
Well, she had to be the one to
hire Cross to capture Adam.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.252
She's still
gunning hard for Ziva.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.993
BISHOP:
Well, it makes sense that she
would be holding a grudge.

23:06.036 --> 23:09.910
She was rising to power in that
splinter group alongside Ari.

23:09.953 --> 23:13.174
So when Ziva killed him...Sahar lost everything,

23:13.217 --> 23:15.350
went off her rocker,
I know that.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.526
Adam said Ziva
knows Sahar.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.094
Ziva's trying to figure out
anybody who fits that bill.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.922
This is what we got so far.
I'll look into it.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.967
You expect more
from her, okay?

23:26.013 --> 23:27.928
How's she doing?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.233
Back in her office.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.192
Adam's another significant loss
for her, Gibbs.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.454
She needs to stop
and process that.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.587
She's not using her head, Jack.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.111
And what about you?
Where are you on all this?

23:37.154 --> 23:38.982
She asked me to help.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.854
Yeah, but at what cost?

23:40.897 --> 23:44.423
This is not about
who's feeling what, Jack.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.731
We got to get something
up on that screen, now.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.996
[indistinct chatter]

24:16.759 --> 24:18.021
Ziva.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.808
I subdued and questioned
the target.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.592
He had many secrets,
but none of them

24:23.636 --> 24:25.115
had anything to
do with Sahar.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.465
It does not matter.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.902
A car will arrive for you

24:28.945 --> 24:30.425

in four minutes.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.907
Take this passport, head to D.C.
and wait to hear from me.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.952
Why? What is going on?I have made contact

24:35.996 --> 24:37.737
with someone inside
Sahar's splinter group.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.347
They're stationed in the U.S.,

24:39.390 --> 24:41.262
and they are bringing me
into the fold.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.655
[sighs]I will gather intel
from the inside

24:42.698 --> 24:44.047
and find a way
to report back to you.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.353
No, that is too dangerous.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.486
I will not let you act
as a mole on my behalf.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.705
This is the only way
we are going to find Sahar.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.881
How many more years of this
can you survive, eh?

24:51.925 --> 24:53.535
That is right. Years.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.495
You have given years of your
life for this, and for what?

25:01.108 --> 25:02.936
You have Tony,

25:02.979 --> 25:05.504
and he will always
have your heart.

25:05.547 --> 25:08.158
But Ziva...

25:08.202 --> 25:11.074
you will always have mine.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.163
Adam, I...

25:14.513 --> 25:17.733
But that is the thing
about love, hmm?

25:17.777 --> 25:20.040
Even if it cannot be returned,

25:20.083 --> 25:22.825
it never goes away.

25:22.869 --> 25:26.046
I will not let you risk
your life for me.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.399
It is not up to you.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.097
Go.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.599
[door opens]

26:01.951 --> 26:03.692
Odette pulled out everything
she had saved along

26:03.736 --> 26:05.476
the way to help me remember.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.609
And?I don't know
what Adam meant.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.264
I still don't know
how I know Sahar.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.005
What about that
list I gave you?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.963
So far, bunch of dead ends.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.399
Why are you here?

26:15.443 --> 26:18.141
Sahar is smarter
than we thought.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.535
I think you should
contact DiNozzo

26:20.579 --> 26:22.581
and have him
take Tali into hiding.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.017
I already told you

26:24.060 --> 26:26.585
Sahar does not know
that Tali exists.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.413
If I make contact,
I put my daughter at risk.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.415
You can use a secure line
at headquarters.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.548
Hell, you probably
have one in here.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.854
That's not the point.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.117
You don't want to make the call,
let me do it.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.075
That's not the point.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.384
You're afraid.

26:43.427 --> 26:46.561
If he knows
how bad it is, he'd come.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.564
I will not risk Tali
losing both of her parents.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.000
He needs to stay with her.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.785
Well, then you need
to trust him to do that, Ziva.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.569
I don't trust. You know
what happens when I trust?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.832
People end up dead. That's
what happens when I trust.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.139
No, we made the right call
down there.And knocking down that pole

26:59.182 --> 27:00.401
would have taken
less than a minute.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.837
We could have saved him,
we could've...No,

27:01.881 --> 27:03.230
we would all be dead.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.666

these years did to you.

No.

never been clearer.

27:17.374 --> 27:20.073
Perhaps it was clouded

27:20.116 --> 27:22.684

to save you.

27:25.774 --> 27:28.559
Had I not taken that shot,

27:28.603 --> 27:30.692

everything you could for Ziva,

You need a minute?

28:14.083 --> 28:17.130
No.
What do we know?

28:17.173 --> 28:20.655
Well... as you can see,
Adam's body

28:20.699 --> 28:23.440
suffered a significant amount
of trauma.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.182
Many of these wounds
were reopened repeatedly.

28:26.226 --> 28:29.359
He was tortured.
What about the other one?

28:29.403 --> 28:32.623
Cross died from gunshot wounds
inflicted by Gibbs and Ziva.

28:32.667 --> 28:36.410
I sent his stomach contents and
swabs up to Kasie for analysis.

Fascinating as this is,

There was a large amount
of a chemical brightening agent

29:20.410 --> 29:22.804
on the swab of Cross'
left hand.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.154

to get what she wants, Gibbs.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.898
Yeah, or maybe we called
the wrong diner.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.554
Gibbs, why are you
questioning this?

33:11.598 --> 33:12.947
Victor said it was her,
and I saw your face--

33:12.991 --> 33:14.514
you knew what he was gonna say
before he said it.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.256
I want proof.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.563
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
McGee told me
how much this boy means to you.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.221
Now, whose judgment
is being clouded?

33:26.265 --> 33:29.050
You don't do anything
until I say so.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.055
If Victor knows
this much about Sahar,

33:34.099 --> 33:35.709
it's likely he knows more.

33:35.752 --> 33:36.971
We should
question him again.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.233
Well, that's not happening.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.409
He lawyered up
on the way to NCIS.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.544
What did my mom do?

33:44.587 --> 33:45.980
I don't know.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.376
Maybe nothing.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.726
But I need you
to help me find her.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.467
If something happens to her,

33:54.510 --> 33:56.730
I'll be alone.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.906
[sniffling softly]

33:58.949 --> 34:01.082
Phin.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.171
Do you know where she is?

34:03.215 --> 34:06.000
No. I thought she was at work.
I swear.

34:09.134 --> 34:12.050
Promise me
you won't let her get hurt.

34:15.749 --> 34:16.837
[sniffles]

34:26.499 --> 34:27.891
Uh, I said the thing.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.676
I said "lawyer."I heard.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.807
But until he arrives,

34:30.851 --> 34:32.853
I thought you and I
could chew the lard.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.421
What? What does that ev...
I-I... No, no, no, no, no.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.944
You can't do that.
Hey, there's rules.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.685
Well, I don't work
here, and...

34:38.728 --> 34:41.383
no one knows
I'm here anyway, so...

34:41.427 --> 34:43.864
this little chat you
and I are gonna have--

34:43.907 --> 34:45.648
it's gonna be off the books.

34:45.692 --> 34:46.997
What?

34:47.041 --> 34:48.912
Your friend.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.132
Cross tortured a good man.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.440
Look, I don't even know

34:54.483 --> 34:56.181
what ride you're on
right now, but, uh,

34:56.224 --> 34:57.399
I already said
everything I know,

34:57.443 --> 34:58.618
so you can try
to scare me...

34:58.661 --> 35:00.098
Oh! No, no, no.This knife

35:00.141 --> 35:01.838
has met deviants
in the streets of Israel,

35:01.882 --> 35:04.276
in the sweatshops of Turkey, the
high seas, the Horn of Africa,

35:04.319 --> 35:07.148
and every alley, gutter
and rotting pit in between,

35:07.192 --> 35:09.019
[grunts]and it never once,

35:09.063 --> 35:11.109
never once...
has it failed me.Uh-huh, uh-huh.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.937
Ow. Okay, you're...
you're Ziva David. Okay.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.417
Just lose the knife,
and I'll talk, okay?

35:15.461 --> 35:17.419
I don't like knives...You talk.
You have to talk!

35:17.463 --> 35:19.029
I don't like knives!

35:21.206 --> 35:24.034
All right, look, listen...

35:24.078 --> 35:26.167
Cross was holding
your friend, right,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.082
but h-he never tortured him.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.129
Sahar did that herself.

35:31.172 --> 35:34.393
Yeah. She'd be like,
"I'm at my waitressing job,"

35:34.436 --> 35:37.396
but really she was out
looking for leads on you.

35:37.439 --> 35:38.962
Her "work nights"...

35:39.006 --> 35:41.182
she'd end up cutting up
your friend or whatever,

35:41.226 --> 35:44.446
try to get him to say where
you were, but he never did.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.839
How do you know this?

35:45.882 --> 35:48.842
Sahar would show up
at that building

35:48.885 --> 35:50.931
to see your friend, and bam...

35:50.974 --> 35:51.932
Cross would leave.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.673
He'd come to the club, drink,

35:53.716 --> 35:55.327
spill his guts--
that's how I know.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.024
[yells]

35:57.067 --> 35:59.026
Why should I believe you?

35:59.069 --> 36:01.811
Only time
that Cross talked to Sahar

36:01.855 --> 36:04.640
was when she went
to that building, okay? See?

36:04.684 --> 36:07.208
She probably thinks
everything is still normal.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.124
Sahar's on her way
to question Adam now.

36:11.125 --> 36:11.952
Oh.

36:13.823 --> 36:14.955
Hey!

36:16.826 --> 36:18.915
What the...?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.623
[clatter in distance]

36:38.413 --> 36:40.154
[gunshots]

36:53.950 --> 36:56.431
[grunting]

37:16.190 --> 37:17.365
[grunts]

37:17.409 --> 37:18.497
[yells]

37:18.540 --> 37:19.846
[groans]

37:25.155 --> 37:27.201
Ari and I...

37:27.245 --> 37:30.073
had a vision for our people.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.033
We were building
a legacy.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.731
And with one shot...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.690
you ended it.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.128
But our story isn't over...

37:41.171 --> 37:43.086
[sniffs]
you and I.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.047
Just last night...

37:47.090 --> 37:49.528
when I came here

37:49.571 --> 37:51.269
to visit Adam...

37:54.097 --> 37:55.751
...something happened.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.929
He was delirious with pain,

37:59.973 --> 38:01.540
and he thought

38:01.583 --> 38:02.715
I was you.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.977
And he said to me,

38:04.020 --> 38:06.458
"Your daughter will be safe.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.025
You have my word."

38:09.069 --> 38:10.853
[panting]

38:12.072 --> 38:14.422
You have a daughter.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.424
[grunts loudly,
kicks wooden beam]

38:17.860 --> 38:19.775
After I kill you,

38:19.819 --> 38:22.517
I will find her...

38:22.561 --> 38:26.216
and I will end your legacy.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.218
My daughter...

38:28.262 --> 38:31.613
will be everything
she's meant to be.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.224
[grunting, kicking]

38:57.247 --> 38:59.119
How did he know
where Sahar would be?

38:59.162 --> 39:00.250
The laptop.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.557
The one Phineas had left
at Gibbs' house.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.037
Sahar had bugged it.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.386
Phin had no idea.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.083
But Gibbs--

39:07.127 --> 39:09.129
he figured it out.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.870
McGEE:
We traced the bug

39:10.913 --> 39:12.872
to a burn phone
that Sahar had on her.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.917
Pinged it for a location.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.659
14 years ago,

39:17.703 --> 39:20.706
Ziva kills her brother Ari.

39:22.185 --> 39:25.101
14 years and one bullet.

39:25.145 --> 39:28.322
Look what it's left in its wake.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.935
ODETTE:
Right or wrong,
every time we act,

39:32.979 --> 39:35.285
something is lost that
we can never regain.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.811
Don't you agree?

39:40.769 --> 39:44.556
I'm not going to apologize, if
that's why you called me here.

39:44.599 --> 39:48.037
Do you know why I asked you
to retrieve that drive?

39:48.081 --> 39:49.952
You said Ziva
doesn't do well in crowds.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.432
I did say that.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.043
And yet I'm fully aware
her anxiety

39:54.087 --> 39:55.654
could strike at any moment.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.220
Crowd or empty room.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.530
So you knew she was too proud
to call Gibbs herself,

40:02.574 --> 40:04.402
but she needed him.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.839
And, in a way,
he needed her, too.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.972
They had unfinished business
to address.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.105
Why involve me at all?

40:12.148 --> 40:14.194
Why not just call Gibbs?

40:16.109 --> 40:18.328
Two birds with one stone,
my dear.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.464
I had a performance
to evaluate.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.815
Took a lot of guts to walk away
from me with that drive.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.820
I see a certain...

40:31.864 --> 40:34.301
promise in you, Agent Bishop.

40:36.129 --> 40:38.087
I'd like
to offer you some...

40:38.131 --> 40:40.438
specialized training,

40:40.481 --> 40:43.528
if you'd be interested.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.097
[toy's siren blaring]

40:51.710 --> 40:54.321
[door opens, closes]

40:57.542 --> 41:00.066
How's the arm?Nothing serious.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.241
I'll live.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.808
Phineas?

41:02.851 --> 41:05.550
He's asleep upstairs.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.729
I haven't told him yet.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.996
[sighs]

41:17.039 --> 41:19.607
[sighs heavily]

41:21.217 --> 41:24.830
After you left my office,
I did what you said.

41:24.873 --> 41:28.137
I called Tony and I told him
to take Tali into hiding.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.923
For everyone's safety,
I do not know where they went.

41:30.966 --> 41:33.839
Once they are there
and secure, Tony...

41:33.882 --> 41:35.971
will make contact with me.

41:36.015 --> 41:38.408
You looking for a place
to stay till then?

41:39.671 --> 41:41.150
[laughs]

41:51.073 --> 41:53.554
I should not
have let you mourn me.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.863
I should have come to you
after the explosion.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.125
I should have trusted you.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.214
You would have
been there for me.

42:03.695 --> 42:06.045
Like you were there tonight.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.308
It cost a lot.

42:14.314 --> 42:18.100
But I will never regret
taking that shot.

42:19.885 --> 42:23.149
Like I'll never regret
the one I took for you, either.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.328
PHINEAS [in distance]:
Jethro Gibbs?

42:28.371 --> 42:30.330
Are you there?
