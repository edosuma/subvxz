WEBVTT

00:09.052 --> 00:10.880
Ziva, what happened to you?

00:10.923 --> 00:12.882
ZIVA:
One of my demons
has become anxiety.

00:12.925 --> 00:15.058
If they find you with Gibbs,
you will pay the price.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.278
And so will I.GIBBS: I want to know

00:17.321 --> 00:19.410
who we're running from.Her name is Sahar.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.238
She wants me dead.
And now she's after you. [gunshot]

00:21.282 --> 00:23.632
Sahar was rising to power
with my brother

00:23.675 --> 00:25.068
until I killed him.

00:25.112 --> 00:28.593
The only way back home to Tali
is if Sahar is dead.

00:28.637 --> 00:31.814
It's over.But I will not be going back
to prison.

00:31.857 --> 00:32.858
[gunshots]

00:35.774 --> 00:38.821
There's one more thing I have
to do to put all this behind me.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.692
And this time,

00:40.736 --> 00:43.521
I have to do it alone.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.656
â™ª [people whooping]

00:47.699 --> 00:50.354
[indistinct chatter]

00:53.314 --> 00:55.229
The hell you think you're going?

00:55.272 --> 00:56.534
I have an appointment
with Mr. Mir.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.536
Carter?Yeah.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.103
Yeah, let her through.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.283
Wow.

01:06.327 --> 01:09.025
You got, like, your own
thing going, huh?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.635
Kind of like, uh,
apple pie or something.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.638
Is this happening or not?

01:13.682 --> 01:15.901
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, have a seat.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.385
I said sit down.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.608
Ooh...

01:26.651 --> 01:29.176
Took a lot of balls
walking in here all by yourself

01:29.219 --> 01:31.003
dressed like
my Aunt Karen, huh?

01:31.047 --> 01:33.441
Hey. I got a room in the back--

01:33.484 --> 01:35.182
it's just four walls.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.574
But there's a pile of stuff
in there

01:36.618 --> 01:38.794
that would shoot us
straight to the clouds. [sniffs]

01:38.837 --> 01:41.188
The drive. Now.

01:42.406 --> 01:43.842
Or I walk.

01:44.887 --> 01:47.498
The money first.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.853
[line ringing]

01:54.897 --> 01:56.638
Make the transfer.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.248
[phone dings]

02:02.296 --> 02:03.906
[chuckles]

02:05.125 --> 02:06.474
Ah.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.738
Everything's on it?

02:09.781 --> 02:11.783
Oh, I got no idea
what's on it, Apple Pie.

02:11.827 --> 02:14.482
You see, I'm in the business
of information. It's what I do.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.440
So I just stay out
of the details, you know?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.312
Hey.

02:18.355 --> 02:21.358
I am a hundred grand richer
than I was when you sat down.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.316
You missed out, Apple.

02:23.534 --> 02:27.190
Oh, come on.
I like the spunk.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
Bye, Apple.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.376
I got it.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.640
Ziva will thank you
for your assistance.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.906
Odette, Gibbs hasn't
heard from her since she left.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.213
Where is she?
Why hasn't she gone home yet?

02:50.257 --> 02:52.563
It's safer for you not to know.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.217
Did you really think
that I was just gonna

02:54.261 --> 02:56.306
blindly keep another one
of Ziva's secrets?

02:58.395 --> 03:00.049
The only reason I agreed to this

03:00.092 --> 03:02.356
was to find out
what's going on with her

03:02.399 --> 03:03.966
and report back to my team.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.403
Eleanor.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.275
Give me the drive.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.321
Or what?

03:21.636 --> 03:23.638
â™ª

03:53.233 --> 03:55.322
Ho, ho, ho.Jethro Gibbs, you're here.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.453
[chuckles]Come on.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.541
It's going everywhere.Wait.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.674
PHINEAS:
We don't know how to stop it.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.459
For the record, I was against
calling you this late.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.069
But we flipped a coin
and I won.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.202
Yeah, fair is fair.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.986
Got it.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.727
Ah. Lord above.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.251
[chuckling]:
You're an angel.[chuckles]

04:11.294 --> 04:12.382
Told you he'd fix it.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.470
I just turned off the water.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.950
I'll come back tomorrow
with a part.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.604
Thank you.

04:16.647 --> 04:17.735
Huh.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.998
You okay?Yeah.

04:20.042 --> 04:23.306
There was a sharp edge
on the pipe.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.874
You know, if you need help
with anything, I'm here.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.445
Jethro Gibbs,

04:31.488 --> 04:32.968
do you like trees
with tinsel on them?

04:33.011 --> 04:34.578
Well, yeah. Who doesn't?

04:34.622 --> 04:37.494
Awesome. Because I'm gonna
dedicate our tree to you,

04:37.538 --> 04:38.669
since you're the one
who got it for us.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.628
And I'm gonna
put this on top,

04:40.671 --> 04:43.326
instead of a star, because
you're kind of like the police,

04:43.370 --> 04:45.415
except way cooler.Phineas.

04:45.459 --> 04:48.418
Oh, the lights are broken.
Can you fix them?Phin!

04:48.462 --> 04:50.420
I think Agent Gibbs has
helped us enough for one night.[phone ringing]

04:51.421 --> 04:53.293
Hey. Bishop.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.816
See, Mom?
I told you.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.470
Agent calls never stop.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.777
Wait.
What exactly did you do for her?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.692
BISHOP: Met with a man
named Victor Mir.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.259
Owns a club in Langdon.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.434
Picked up this drive from him.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.696
Ziva asked you to do that?

05:05.740 --> 05:07.481
Not exactly.
Uh, Odette

05:07.524 --> 05:09.396
asked me to do it for Ziva.Why--

05:09.439 --> 05:10.658
Ziva couldn't do it herself?

05:10.701 --> 05:12.529
The place was packed.
Odette said

05:12.573 --> 05:14.357
Ziva doesn't do well in crowds.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.663
Since when?Since when?

05:15.706 --> 05:18.492
I don't know.
Look, whatever is on here

05:18.535 --> 05:19.536
is worth 100K.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.495
Odette rounded up the money
herself.

05:21.538 --> 05:24.498
So, Odette paid for the drive,
but you walked away with it.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.977
Yeah. I'm done with secrets.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.240
Damn.
Boss move, Bishop.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.504
Yeah, but why aren't we
telling Gibbs this?

05:30.547 --> 05:33.376
Uh, I did. I gave him and Vance
the quick version.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.596
Vance is in Geneva,
Gibbs is on his way in.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.380
All right, let's
see what's on it.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.948
By the way, thank you
for including me on this.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.993
I-I missed Ziva
last time she came,

05:42.037 --> 05:44.474
and I did not take it well.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.389
KASIE:
So, this Odette-- she pretends

05:46.433 --> 05:49.174
to be landlady,
she rounds up weapons and cash.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.525
What's her deal?TORRES: Old people are tricky.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.569
I don't trust her.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.571
It looks like

05:54.615 --> 05:55.616
there's just the one photo.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.400
100K for

05:57.444 --> 05:59.576
two guys
walking into a building?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.448
Wait a second, who is that?
Is that...

06:02.536 --> 06:04.581
That's Adam Eshel.Who is that?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.235
Childhood friend
of Ziva's.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.411
Israeli intelligence.
Shin Bet.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.673
That other guy's holding him.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.545
Looks like his hands are bound.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.417
Do we know anything else
about this Adam guy?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.550
Ziva mentioned him
in her journal

06:16.593 --> 06:18.813
as a friend and contact,
but other than that, no.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.118
Well, maybe Gibbs knows more.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.772
Why is Gibbs
not here yet?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.578
Gibbs.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.451
What happened?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.148
Are you okay?Are you?

06:50.192 --> 06:53.761
The number I gave you
was for emergencies only.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.285
Yeah, I figured
there had to be one.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.504
That's the only way
you would have pulled in

06:57.547 --> 06:59.201
one of my agents
behind my back.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.072
What?Bishop called me.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.553
Said that she did some kind
of underground pickup for you.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.208
I do not know
anything about this.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.255
I swear to you on my life.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.997
Then what the hell's going on?

07:21.223 --> 07:22.964
I understand your
reasons, Odette,

07:23.007 --> 07:24.400
but this is unacceptable.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
We'll discuss it later.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.974
That was Odette.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.629
She was the one
who brought in Bishop.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.587
Why?

07:37.631 --> 07:39.459
She was trying
to protect me.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.895
From what?

07:43.637 --> 07:46.378
Bishop said
it was about the crowd?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.119
The anxiety?

07:49.599 --> 07:52.036
First time it happened
was in a crowd.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.039
In a market.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.041
It was the worst moment
of my life,

07:57.085 --> 07:59.000
and you know
that's saying a lot.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.830
Odette thought
sending you in a crowd

08:02.873 --> 08:04.396
would trigger another attack.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.530
The thing is panic strikes
when it wants.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.272
Gibbs, I remember
rule number six well,

08:10.315 --> 08:12.535
but I am truly sorry.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.058
This thing that I told you
I was working on,

08:14.102 --> 08:15.973
I told you I wanted to do it
on my own, and I meant it.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.062
Hey, Ziva, I'm not doing
this again with you.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.630
You don't want my help, go.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.158
Do you remember my contact?

08:27.202 --> 08:29.421
Yeah, guy who made
the drop on the bus.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.728
Adam Eshel, yes.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.906
I wanted to make sure
that he was safe.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.431
I wanted to make sure
that he was alive.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.390
Been trying to find him.
I can't...

08:41.433 --> 08:43.871
I can't find him.
Something is wrong.

08:43.914 --> 08:46.395
Odette just told me that she
put out feelers to her network,

08:46.438 --> 08:47.701
offering a reward

08:47.744 --> 08:49.224
for intel on his whereabouts.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.226
The drive that Bishop retrieved

08:51.269 --> 08:53.750
was in response to that,
and I need it back.

08:53.794 --> 08:57.537
You said going home was the only
thing that mattered to you.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.974
Why put that on hold...

09:00.017 --> 09:01.541
to find him?

The attack occurred
on an isolated farmhouse

09:09.070 --> 09:10.680
once belonging to former

09:10.724 --> 09:13.117
Mossad director Eli David.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.685
Reports suggest
one possible survivor,

09:15.729 --> 09:19.123
but that has yet to be
confirmed. In other news...

09:19.167 --> 09:21.517
Ziva. Come.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.217
They said the explosion
nearly took the whole house.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.262
You are not hurt?

09:27.305 --> 09:29.046
She's exhausted, but she's okay.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.095
Quickly. Better to do
this before she wakes.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.487
Perhaps there's another way.

09:35.531 --> 09:38.621
Ziva, this is your
way, remember?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.275
This is the only way.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.278
I will deliver her to Orli
and she will give her to Tony.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.759
Adam, I cannot do this.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.631
If you want her to
survive this, you must.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.156
Come.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.854
Follow her

10:01.513 --> 10:04.168
Your daughter will be safe.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.344
I give you my word.
Now go.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.694
And stick to the

Adam helped me put a name to
the person who wanted me dead.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.514
Sahar.

10:45.557 --> 10:47.777
Adam became a mole
inside Sahar's splinter group

And that's how

10:49.605 --> 10:52.739
you found out that Sahar
was coming after Gibbs.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.218
It was an inside tip
from Adam, yes.

So when you warned Gibbs,
Adam was exposed,

10:56.743 --> 10:58.048
outed as a mole.

puts it at a week ago.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.818
He's alive.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.298
Am I missing something?

11:31.168 --> 11:32.648
We killed Sahar.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.867
She was dead on the floor.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.303
Yeah, and all of her people

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
were rounded up by INTERPOL.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.698
Yeah, so who's this guy
that's got Adam?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
Okay, let's go.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.227
Come to mama.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.055
Give me a match.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.231
Yeah, light it up.Jimmy, what the...

11:50.274 --> 11:51.798
Ooh!

11:51.841 --> 11:54.888
How long have you
been sitting there?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.759
I don't know--
maybe ten minutes?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.892
Gibbs and Ziva are meeting
with the team upstairs,

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
and I... I thought
that their next stop

12:00.328 --> 12:01.764
would definitely be here.
I am definitely

12:01.808 --> 12:04.767
not missing out
on seeing Ziva again.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.856
Maybe you could say hi
next time instead of lurking

12:06.900 --> 12:08.902
in the corner
like a evil leprechaun.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.251
Got an update?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.906
-Ziva! [laughing]
-[grunts]

12:12.949 --> 12:14.429
Good to see you, Jimmy.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.039
Not now.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.476
Right, you got an
important mission.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.783
Ziva, the myth, the legend--
pleasure to meet you.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.045
I have stuff for you.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.830
I'm all eardrums.Huh?

12:23.873 --> 12:26.789
Just go on.Okay. So, facial recognition

12:26.833 --> 12:29.792
is up and running
on Adam's captor, and this,

12:29.836 --> 12:32.490
as you know, is Adam and his
captor walking into a building

12:32.534 --> 12:34.492
about a week ago.
I was able to clean up

12:34.536 --> 12:36.799
a reflection in one
of the windows.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.409
Get us the location
of the building.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.238
Was it a reflection
of a street sign or...?

12:41.282 --> 12:43.414
Please, that would've
been too easy.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.851
No, the reflection was of

12:44.894 --> 12:46.809
half a number
on a utility pole transformer.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.725
So I was able to use that
plus the direction of the sun

12:49.769 --> 12:51.422
to triangulate a...Got an address?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.033
Oh, are you
seriously not gonna,

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
like, let me explain
how I did this?

12:56.210 --> 12:58.516
Okay.
It's an

12:58.560 --> 13:00.823
old factory set for demolition.
Oof.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.607
Looks like the building
is barely standing.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.739
Thank you, Kasie.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.871
Get us the address.

13:04.914 --> 13:05.872
Update the team.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.830
And I want an ID on that guy.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.572
Okay, explain
the eardrums thing.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.238
There's no one here.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.331
Hey, McGee.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.419
We got nothing.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.637
We'll canvass the area.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.205
We'll get back to you.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.860
There were several buildings
half a mile back.[music playing in distance]

13:37.904 --> 13:39.949
Perhaps someone
saw something that...

14:01.405 --> 14:03.581
[music continues playing]

14:25.255 --> 14:27.040
[music stops]MAN: Help. Here.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.172
ZIVA:
Adam.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.740
I'm here.

14:31.783 --> 14:32.872
[wheezing]

14:32.915 --> 14:35.352
Sahar. Sahar...

14:36.484 --> 14:38.312
Sahar...

14:38.355 --> 14:39.487
No, no, no, no, no.

14:39.530 --> 14:40.923
She's dead.
It's over.

14:40.967 --> 14:41.968
No.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.926
The woman was a decoy.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.058
What woman?

14:45.101 --> 14:46.886
The woman you killed.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.064
The real Sahar is alive.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.326
Who is she?

14:52.369 --> 14:53.457
Where is she, Adam?

14:53.501 --> 14:54.981
You know her.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.332
You know her.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.986
Adam, how do I know her?

15:00.029 --> 15:00.900
Adam?

15:00.943 --> 15:03.119
Adam?[grunts]

15:03.163 --> 15:05.121
He's breathing.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.993
We need to get him out of here.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.864
GIBBS:
I don't have a key for this.
Where's the key?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.702
Got 'em.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.226
[creaking]

15:23.270 --> 15:24.749
Uh-oh.

15:41.679 --> 15:44.334
ADAM:
You see, there she is.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.771
I observed her from afar
the entire journey.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.382
[short laugh]

15:48.425 --> 15:49.992
She cried on the plane
with Orli,

15:50.036 --> 15:51.385
But once she saw Tony

15:51.428 --> 15:54.301
there were no
more tears.

15:59.610 --> 16:02.004
He put her in a stroller
and took her to the park, huh?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.179
[short laugh]

16:04.615 --> 16:06.052
You must take these

16:06.095 --> 16:08.358
and destroy them,
Adam, please.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.710
I cannot bring myself to do it.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.583
The panic?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.894
It comes and goes
after I left Tali.

16:22.938 --> 16:26.072
But Tali's safety is not
the only thing I worry about.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.510
Tony's gonna
come looking for me.

16:29.553 --> 16:30.728
Of that, I'm certain.

16:30.772 --> 16:33.122
So will Gibbs.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.689
They believe the story.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.213
They believe
you are dead.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.918
Ziva, we will
work together.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.616
We will find this threat
against you,

16:48.659 --> 16:50.705
and we will neutralize it.

16:55.231 --> 16:58.756
GIBBS:
Ziva, wake up.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.540
Ziva, you all right?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.020
Hey, you okay?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.282
Yeah.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.935
You all right?I'm okay, yeah.

17:03.979 --> 17:04.980
What happened?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.330
We fell through.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.202
Adam. Adam!

17:09.245 --> 17:10.855
We need to get back up there.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.248
No, there's nothing
to hang on to.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.380
There's no
climbing out.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.642
Oh...

17:14.685 --> 17:17.384
What about
your cell phone?

17:17.427 --> 17:19.603
Eh, there's no cell reception.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.214
Well, then tell me
how to get out of here, Gibbs.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
He's dying up there.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.652
There's a staircase
back there.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.871
There's a door behind
all this stuff.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.048
You've got to be kidding me.
There's no time.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.484
Who knows how long
it'll take us

17:30.527 --> 17:31.833
to move all this stuff
out of the way

17:31.876 --> 17:34.357
or if we'll even be
able to do it at all.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.708
Look.
[grunts]

17:37.752 --> 17:39.406
Hey. Hey, hey!
Hold up!

17:39.449 --> 17:41.538
No, that's-that's
a load-bearing beam.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.410
The beam above
it is rotted.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.499
This whole place
is rotted to hell.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.109
Okay, but if we knock
out this pole,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.719
the entire structure will
collapse, and then we can

17:48.763 --> 17:50.547
just climb up the rubble.No, no.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.636
If it collapses, we'll be
dead underneath it.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.290
We can take cover
in the shaft.No.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.813
We won't have time
to get there.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.120
I can't let him die
up there alone, Gibbs.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.514
What about Sahar?

18:00.557 --> 18:02.690
You can't protect
your daughter from her

18:02.733 --> 18:04.648
if you are down here...

18:04.692 --> 18:05.736
dead.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.740
Adam said I knew Sahar.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.919
But I don't know who she is.

18:14.963 --> 18:17.400
Manual labor.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.663
It'll help you think.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.715
We got ourselves
a match, baby.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.326
Meet Adam Eshel's captor.Who is he?

18:30.370 --> 18:32.676
TORRES:
He's a gun-for-hire,
wanted in eight countries.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.852
Born in England, though
that's up for debate.

18:34.896 --> 18:38.247
Mossad says he's from Belgium,
MI6 claims he's Croatian.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.857
Does he have a name?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.946
MCGEE:
Got an alias-- Gabriel Cross.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.600
This guy is very
into aliases.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.820
Kasie made a list of
the ones we know of.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.778
So, basically we don't
know who this dude is.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.432
It's gonna take forever
to go through these names

18:49.476 --> 18:50.781
to figure out
who hired him.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.479
Gibbs' phone went
straight to voice mail.

18:52.522 --> 18:55.177
Well, he and Ziva are canvassing
the area around the factory.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.875
Could be reception's
just spotty out there.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.488
[grunting]

19:01.531 --> 19:02.837
Pull.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.664
Come on.[shouts]

19:03.707 --> 19:05.100
It's meaningless.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.101
It's no use.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
We'll never move this thing.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.019
Adam!

19:12.977 --> 19:15.719
Okay, you can take cover
or you can help me.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.852
Ziva.Look, we tried it your way

19:17.895 --> 19:19.549
and it didn't work.

19:19.593 --> 19:20.724
I'm gonna knock down this pole.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.248
And I'm gonna take cover, okay?

19:22.291 --> 19:23.510
Will you just listen to me?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.685
Our muscles are burnt out.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.861
Give them a minute
to recover,

19:26.904 --> 19:28.558
and then we can
move this thing.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.865
Gibbs, he doesn't have a minute.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.347
You're gonna...
Come on.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.349
Tell me about Tali.

19:36.392 --> 19:37.611
What?

19:37.654 --> 19:38.960
[chuckles]

19:40.309 --> 19:41.963
Tell me about her.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.360
Oh...

19:48.970 --> 19:50.537
She hates Band-Aids.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.413
After Tony
left NCIS with Tali,

19:57.457 --> 19:59.415
he tracked me down in Cairo.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.374
He found me.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.985
Since then I've told him
only what he needed to know.

20:04.028 --> 20:07.945
We've had very little contact.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
So, Cairo was

20:09.817 --> 20:12.167
the last time I held...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
Tali.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.220
She had this, uh...

20:21.263 --> 20:23.918
little scrape on her knee.

20:23.961 --> 20:26.573
Oh, she hates Band-Aids.
[laughs]

20:26.616 --> 20:28.792
So...

20:28.836 --> 20:32.187
Tony got her to wear one

20:32.231 --> 20:35.843
by cutting it
into the shape of a heart.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.325
When I saw this,
I... I just knew

20:39.368 --> 20:41.544
he would watch over her.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.807
He would keep her safe.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.423
But Adam has kept her safe, too.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.252
By watching over me.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.042
Let's get him out of here.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
On three.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.004
One, two, three, go.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.790
[both grunting]

21:09.833 --> 21:12.009
[exclaims]

21:17.537 --> 21:19.321
Adam.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.931
He doesn't have a pulse.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.544
[grunts]

21:24.587 --> 21:26.981
Come on, fight.
Fight, Adam.

21:27.024 --> 21:29.375
Come on, stay with me,
stay with me.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.767
Fight.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.116
[grunting]

21:32.160 --> 21:33.683
Ziva.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.076
Call an ambulance.

21:35.119 --> 21:36.947
Stay with me.Hey.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.036
Stop it.

21:39.080 --> 21:39.907
[grunts]

21:39.950 --> 21:41.996
Call an ambulance, Gibbs!

21:42.039 --> 21:44.172
He's gone.
He's gone.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.739
[grunts]

22:04.584 --> 22:05.628
Hey, you all right?

22:05.672 --> 22:06.890
Oh, I've been better.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.501
We've gone back
through everything

22:08.544 --> 22:09.806
that we had on Sahar.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.853
Gibbs.Boss, you okay? Ziva okay?

22:12.896 --> 22:14.681
How'd we get this wrong?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.640
Somebody tell me how
the woman we killed

22:17.684 --> 22:18.989
ended up some kind of fake.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.513
Well, we got
part of it right.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.254
The real Sahar was
in a Syrian POW camp

22:23.298 --> 22:24.995
before Ziva's
farmhouse exploded.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.911
And none of our sources ever
had a real description of her.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.217
BISHOP:
But when we went
through the chatter

22:29.260 --> 22:31.872
with this person in mind,
we found two mentions

22:31.915 --> 22:33.395
of a woman
who aided Sahar's escape.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.137
McGEE:
She was described
as "dark hair, small in stature,

22:36.180 --> 22:37.617
but sure of herself
in weaponry."

22:37.660 --> 22:38.835
TORRES:
We also have lots

22:38.879 --> 22:40.054
of sources that
say that Sahar

22:40.097 --> 22:41.360
has been at two
places at once

22:41.403 --> 22:42.578
over the years.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.058
That's what made her
so hard to track.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.973
BISHOP:
And because no one knew
what she looked like,

22:46.016 --> 22:48.584
we think she had a habit of
having her minions pose as her.

22:48.628 --> 22:51.413
That's how she was able to keep
her locations under wraps.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.634
Take down the picture.

22:54.677 --> 22:55.939
Take it down.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.767
I want to know
who the real Sahar is,

22:57.811 --> 23:00.379
and where she is now.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.381
Well, she had to be the one to
hire Cross to capture Adam.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.252
She's still
gunning hard for Ziva.

23:04.295 --> 23:05.993
BISHOP:
Well, it makes sense that she
would be holding a grudge.

23:06.036 --> 23:09.910
She was rising to power in that
splinter group alongside Ari.

23:09.953 --> 23:13.174
So when Ziva killed him...Sahar lost everything,

23:13.217 --> 23:15.350
went off her rocker,
I know that.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.526
Adam said Ziva
knows Sahar.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.094
Ziva's trying to figure out
anybody who fits that bill.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.922
This is what we got so far.
I'll look into it.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.967
You expect more
from her, okay?

23:26.013 --> 23:27.928
How's she doing?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.233
Back in her office.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.192
Adam's another significant loss
for her, Gibbs.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.454
She needs to stop
and process that.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.587
She's not using her head, Jack.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.111
And what about you?
Where are you on all this?

23:37.154 --> 23:38.982
She asked me to help.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.854
Yeah, but at what cost?

23:40.897 --> 23:44.423
This is not about
who's feeling what, Jack.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.731
We got to get something
up on that screen, now.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.996
[indistinct chatter]

24:16.759 --> 24:18.021
Ziva.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.808
I subdued and questioned
the target.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.592
He had many secrets,
but none of them

24:23.636 --> 24:25.115
had anything to
do with Sahar.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.465
It does not matter.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.902
A car will arrive for you

24:28.945 --> 24:30.425
outside that door
in four minutes.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.907
Take this passport, head to D.C.
and wait to hear from me.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.952
Why? What is going on?I have made contact

24:35.996 --> 24:37.737
with someone inside
Sahar's splinter group.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.347
They're stationed in the U.S.,

24:39.390 --> 24:41.262
and they are bringing me
into the fold.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.655
[sighs]I will gather intel
from the inside

24:42.698 --> 24:44.047
and find a way
to report back to you.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.353
No, that is too dangerous.

24:45.396 --> 24:47.486
I will not let you act
as a mole on my behalf.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.705
This is the only way
we are going to find Sahar.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.881
How many more years of this
can you survive, eh?

24:51.925 --> 24:53.535
That is right. Years.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.495
You have given years of your
life for this, and for what?

25:01.108 --> 25:02.936
You have Tony,

25:02.979 --> 25:05.504
and he will always
have your heart.

25:05.547 --> 25:08.158
But Ziva...

25:08.202 --> 25:11.074
you will always have mine.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.163
Adam, I...

25:14.513 --> 25:17.733
But that is the thing
about love, hmm?

25:17.777 --> 25:20.040
Even if it cannot be returned,

25:20.083 --> 25:22.825
it never goes away.

25:22.869 --> 25:26.046
I will not let you risk
your life for me.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.399
It is not up to you.

25:32.661 --> 25:34.097
Go.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.599
[door opens]

26:01.951 --> 26:03.692
Odette pulled out everything
she had saved along

26:03.736 --> 26:05.476
the way to help me remember.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.609
And?I don't know
what Adam meant.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.264
I still don't know
how I know Sahar.

26:10.307 --> 26:12.005
What about that
list I gave you?

26:12.048 --> 26:13.963
So far, bunch of dead ends.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.399
Why are you here?

26:15.443 --> 26:18.141
Sahar is smarter
than we thought.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.535
I think you should
contact DiNozzo

26:20.579 --> 26:22.581
and have him
take Tali into hiding.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.017
I already told you

26:24.060 --> 26:26.585
Sahar does not know
that Tali exists.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.413
If I make contact,
I put my daughter at risk.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.415
You can use a secure line
at headquarters.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.548
Hell, you probably
have one in here.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.854
That's not the point.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.117
You don't want to make the call,
let me do it.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.075
That's not the point.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.384
You're afraid.

26:43.427 --> 26:46.561
If he knows
how bad it is, he'd come.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.564
I will not risk Tali
losing both of her parents.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.000
He needs to stay with her.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.785
Well, then you need
to trust him to do that, Ziva.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.569
I don't trust. You know
what happens when I trust?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.832
People end up dead. That's
what happens when I trust.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.139
No, we made the right call
down there.And knocking down that pole

26:59.182 --> 27:00.401
would have taken
less than a minute.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.837
We could have saved him,
we could've...No,

27:01.881 --> 27:03.230
we would all be dead.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.666
How do you know that for sure?

27:04.710 --> 27:06.102
I'm telling you, I do.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.931
What I don't know is what
these years did to you.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.325
Your head is not on straight.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.284
No.

27:14.328 --> 27:17.331
My judgment has
never been clearer.

27:17.374 --> 27:20.073
Perhaps it was clouded

27:20.116 --> 27:22.684
the day I killed my brother
to save you.

27:25.774 --> 27:28.559
Had I not taken that shot,

27:28.603 --> 27:30.692
none of this would be happening.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.433
Go ahead, Ziva, blame me.

27:32.476 --> 27:34.914
Whatever.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.525
You need to do right
by your daughter.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.531
[door closes]

27:43.574 --> 27:45.576
[sighs]

27:59.329 --> 28:03.159
I know we didn't know
each other well,

28:03.203 --> 28:06.859
but I also know that you did
everything you could for Ziva,

28:06.902 --> 28:09.818
so... thank you.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.255
Hey.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.040
You need a minute?

28:14.083 --> 28:17.130
No.
What do we know?

28:17.173 --> 28:20.655
Well... as you can see,
Adam's body

28:20.699 --> 28:23.440
suffered a significant amount
of trauma.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.182
Many of these wounds
were reopened repeatedly.

28:26.226 --> 28:29.359
He was tortured.
What about the other one?

28:29.403 --> 28:32.623
Cross died from gunshot wounds
inflicted by Gibbs and Ziva.

28:32.667 --> 28:36.410
I sent his stomach contents and
swabs up to Kasie for analysis.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.455
Did you find anything
on his cell phone?

28:38.499 --> 28:40.327
Burn phone, never used.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.502
You got to make it right, Ellie.

28:41.545 --> 28:42.633
What do you want,
me to send flowers?

28:42.677 --> 28:43.852
All right, listen up, people.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.201
I did some digging
on this Odette lady.

28:45.245 --> 28:48.291
Turns out that she's an ex-CIA.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.816
She was an instructor at MOTC.W-What is that?

28:50.859 --> 28:53.732
It's like hardcore
ranger school for spies.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.343
And back in the day,
she got fired from it. Why?

28:56.386 --> 28:57.648
Frickin' classified.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.085
Oh, man, w... You...

28:59.128 --> 29:01.261
And you're on
her bad side, Bishop.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.002
McGEE:
You stole her drive.

29:03.045 --> 29:05.178
And she's still
furious with you.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.483
Well...

29:06.527 --> 29:08.050
That's what
I'm saying, Ellie.

29:08.094 --> 29:11.706
You cannot piss off that kind
of badass and just walk away.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.186
That's like...

29:13.229 --> 29:15.405
Something you would do?KASIE: Okay.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.799
Fascinating as this is,
I found something.

29:17.843 --> 29:20.367
There was a large amount
of a chemical brightening agent

29:20.410 --> 29:22.804
on the swab of Cross'
left hand.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.154
Meaning what?A whole lot of UV stamps.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.287
The sheer amount of them
tells us two things.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.290
One, he wasn't big
on handwashing. Gross.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.813
And two...

29:31.857 --> 29:33.380
He frequented the place
where he got them.

29:33.423 --> 29:34.773
KASIE:
Ooh. Where you been

29:34.816 --> 29:35.991
hanging out, B?

29:36.035 --> 29:37.253
Victor Mir's club.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.952
The-the stamp gets you
into the VIP area.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.823
But Victor said he
didn't know anything

29:41.867 --> 29:43.433
about what was on that drive.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.132
But if Cross here was
a regular VIP at the club...

29:46.175 --> 29:48.351
Victor lied. He has
to know something.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.571
Well, let's pick him up.
Is he at the club?Always.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.442
But he's unstable and armed

29:52.486 --> 29:56.142
and he's got security and
a place full of innocent people.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.231
So, I mean, we have to
walk in with a plan.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.841
TORRES:
Mm.

29:59.885 --> 30:02.365
I can't wait to see
where she's going with this.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.411
â™ª [people whooping, chattering]

30:11.113 --> 30:13.028
Hey, hey, hey. Let her through,
let her through.

30:16.858 --> 30:20.775
Ah, ha, ha.
Apple, Apple, Apple.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.777
Somebody nuked
the pie, huh?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.170
They pressed a button

30:24.213 --> 30:25.954
and put it in some heels.
[inhales sharply]

30:25.998 --> 30:29.131
You look too good
for this place.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.307
Couldn't stop thinking
about your offer.

30:31.351 --> 30:33.614
Remind me,
'cause my head is, like...

30:33.657 --> 30:34.920
[imitates explosion, chuckles]

30:34.963 --> 30:36.747
That room in back.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.619
A trip to the clouds.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.664
[both chuckle]

30:46.932 --> 30:49.021
â™ª This little light of mine

30:49.064 --> 30:50.849
â™ª I'm gonna let it shine.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.763
Sit.Wait, wait, wait.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.766
I have something to tell you.Mmm.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.377
Merry Christmas.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.379
[laughs]:
What?[chuckles]

30:59.422 --> 31:01.642
Victor Mir. NCIS.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.774
Special Agent Gibbs.
Got a few questions...

31:03.818 --> 31:05.776
[groans]

31:05.820 --> 31:06.995
Hola,Victor.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.823
Uh...

31:08.867 --> 31:10.651
You looking for this?

31:10.694 --> 31:12.000
Oh, look, Apple...

31:12.044 --> 31:13.045
Hands on your head.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.134
[sighs]A woman named Sahar.

31:15.177 --> 31:16.787
Uh...What do you know about her?

31:16.831 --> 31:19.529
You know, I got some friends.
They can make your day real bad.

31:19.573 --> 31:20.879
You should think about that...

31:20.922 --> 31:22.881
[grunts]

31:22.924 --> 31:24.883
Who is Sahar?
Where is she?

31:24.926 --> 31:27.886
She's not...
I don't where she is.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.104
But you know her.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.845
I never met her.
She's...

31:30.889 --> 31:32.455
She's, like,
a pretend waitress or...

31:32.499 --> 31:33.761
The hell does that mean?Oh! God.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.806
She goes by Sarah.
She's got a kid.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.939
[exclaims]

31:37.983 --> 31:39.506
What's the kid's name?

31:39.549 --> 31:41.682
What's the name?

31:41.725 --> 31:43.727
Phineas.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.341
Adam said "You know Sahar."

31:48.384 --> 31:50.604
He wasn't talking to Ziva.
He was talking to you, Gibbs.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.868
Can I help you?You Phineas' mom?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.914
I said not to tell her.
She gets mad.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.741
GIBBS:
Hmm. You okay?

31:58.873 --> 31:59.961
[laughs softly]

32:00.005 --> 32:01.615
SARAH:
Thank you for watching him.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.834
And I will be back
by tomorrow night.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.360
BISHOP:
Gibbs?

32:11.842 --> 32:13.844
Phin,
where are you?

32:18.849 --> 32:20.068
You scared me.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.156
Where's your mom?

32:21.200 --> 32:22.984
She's at work.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.508
She didn't want me
to tell you this, but...

32:25.552 --> 32:28.294
sometimes she leaves me alone
at night to go.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.340
What's wrong,
Jethro Gibbs?

32:39.131 --> 32:41.089
All right, what do we know?

32:41.133 --> 32:43.787
The boy's at your house
with an agent?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.573
McGee brought me up to speed.

32:46.616 --> 32:47.966
I said what
do we know?

32:48.009 --> 32:50.881
We've contacted all diners
within a 20-mile radius.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.883
BISHOP:
None of them have
an employee matching

32:52.927 --> 32:54.581
Sarah's description,
so the waitress job

32:54.624 --> 32:55.974
was likely just part of the act.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.540
McGEE:
We think she moved
in next door

32:57.584 --> 33:00.587
to lie in wait for Ziva
to come back.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.241
She used Phineas
to get close to you.

33:02.284 --> 33:04.156
She's obviously willing
to use any means necessary

33:04.199 --> 33:05.984
to get what she wants, Gibbs.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.898
Yeah, or maybe we called
the wrong diner.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.554
Gibbs, why are you
questioning this?

33:11.598 --> 33:12.947
Victor said it was her,
and I saw your face--

33:12.991 --> 33:14.514
you knew what he was gonna say
before he said it.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.256
I want proof.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.563
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
McGee told me
how much this boy means to you.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.221
Now, whose judgment
is being clouded?

33:26.265 --> 33:29.050
You don't do anything
until I say so.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.055
If Victor knows
this much about Sahar,

33:34.099 --> 33:35.709
it's likely he knows more.

33:35.752 --> 33:36.971
We should
question him again.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.233
Well, that's not happening.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.409
He lawyered up
on the way to NCIS.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.544
What did my mom do?

33:44.587 --> 33:45.980
I don't know.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.376
Maybe nothing.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.726
But I need you
to help me find her.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.467
If something happens to her,

33:54.510 --> 33:56.730
I'll be alone.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.906
[sniffling softly]

33:58.949 --> 34:01.082
Phin.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.171
Do you know where she is?

34:03.215 --> 34:06.000
No. I thought she was at work.
I swear.

34:09.134 --> 34:12.050
Promise me
you won't let her get hurt.

34:15.749 --> 34:16.837
[sniffles]

34:26.499 --> 34:27.891
Uh, I said the thing.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.676
I said "lawyer."I heard.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.807
But until he arrives,

34:30.851 --> 34:32.853
I thought you and I
could chew the lard.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.421
What? What does that ev...
I-I... No, no, no, no, no.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.944
You can't do that.
Hey, there's rules.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.685
Well, I don't work
here, and...

34:38.728 --> 34:41.383
no one knows
I'm here anyway, so...

34:41.427 --> 34:43.864
this little chat you
and I are gonna have--

34:43.907 --> 34:45.648
it's gonna be off the books.

34:45.692 --> 34:46.997
What?

34:47.041 --> 34:48.912
Your friend.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.132
Cross tortured a good man.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.440
Look, I don't even know

34:54.483 --> 34:56.181
what ride you're on
right now, but, uh,

34:56.224 --> 34:57.399
I already said
everything I know,

34:57.443 --> 34:58.618
so you can try
to scare me...

34:58.661 --> 35:00.098
Oh! No, no, no.This knife

35:00.141 --> 35:01.838
has met deviants
in the streets of Israel,

35:01.882 --> 35:04.276
in the sweatshops of Turkey, the
high seas, the Horn of Africa,

35:04.319 --> 35:07.148
and every alley, gutter
and rotting pit in between,

35:07.192 --> 35:09.019
[grunts]and it never once,

35:09.063 --> 35:11.109
never once...
has it failed me.Uh-huh, uh-huh.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.937
Ow. Okay, you're...
you're Ziva David. Okay.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.417
Just lose the knife,
and I'll talk, okay?

35:15.461 --> 35:17.419
I don't like knives...You talk.
You have to talk!

35:17.463 --> 35:19.029
I don't like knives!

35:21.206 --> 35:24.034
All right, look, listen...

35:24.078 --> 35:26.167
Cross was holding
your friend, right,

35:26.211 --> 35:28.082
but h-he never tortured him.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.129
Sahar did that herself.

35:31.172 --> 35:34.393
Yeah. She'd be like,
"I'm at my waitressing job,"

35:34.436 --> 35:37.396
but really she was out
looking for leads on you.

35:37.439 --> 35:38.962
Her "work nights"...

35:39.006 --> 35:41.182
she'd end up cutting up
your friend or whatever,

35:41.226 --> 35:44.446
try to get him to say where
you were, but he never did.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.839
How do you know this?

35:45.882 --> 35:48.842
Sahar would show up
at that building

35:48.885 --> 35:50.931
to see your friend, and bam...

35:50.974 --> 35:51.932
Cross would leave.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.673
He'd come to the club, drink,

35:53.716 --> 35:55.327
spill his guts--
that's how I know.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.024
[yells]

35:57.067 --> 35:59.026
Why should I believe you?

35:59.069 --> 36:01.811
Only time
that Cross talked to Sahar

36:01.855 --> 36:04.640
was when she went
to that building, okay? See?

36:04.684 --> 36:07.208
She probably thinks
everything is still normal.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.124
Sahar's on her way
to question Adam now.

36:11.125 --> 36:11.952
Oh.

36:13.823 --> 36:14.955
Hey!

36:16.826 --> 36:18.915
What the...?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.623
[clatter in distance]

36:38.413 --> 36:40.154
[gunshots]

36:53.950 --> 36:56.431
[grunting]

37:16.190 --> 37:17.365
[grunts]

37:17.409 --> 37:18.497
[yells]

37:18.540 --> 37:19.846
[groans]

37:25.155 --> 37:27.201
Ari and I...

37:27.245 --> 37:30.073
had a vision for our people.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.033
We were building
a legacy.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.731
And with one shot...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.690
you ended it.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.128
But our story isn't over...

37:41.171 --> 37:43.086
[sniffs]
you and I.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.047
Just last night...

37:47.090 --> 37:49.528
when I came here

37:49.571 --> 37:51.269
to visit Adam...

37:54.097 --> 37:55.751
...something happened.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.929
He was delirious with pain,

37:59.973 --> 38:01.540
and he thought

38:01.583 --> 38:02.715
I was you.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.977
And he said to me,

38:04.020 --> 38:06.458
"Your daughter will be safe.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.025
You have my word."

38:09.069 --> 38:10.853
[panting]

38:12.072 --> 38:14.422
You have a daughter.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.424
[grunts loudly,
kicks wooden beam]

38:17.860 --> 38:19.775
After I kill you,

38:19.819 --> 38:22.517
I will find her...

38:22.561 --> 38:26.216
and I will end your legacy.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.218
My daughter...

38:28.262 --> 38:31.613
will be everything
she's meant to be.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.224
[grunting, kicking]

38:57.247 --> 38:59.119
How did he know
where Sahar would be?

38:59.162 --> 39:00.250
The laptop.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.557
The one Phineas had left
at Gibbs' house.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.037
Sahar had bugged it.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.386
Phin had no idea.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.083
But Gibbs--

39:07.127 --> 39:09.129
he figured it out.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.870
McGEE:
We traced the bug

39:10.913 --> 39:12.872
to a burn phone
that Sahar had on her.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.917
Pinged it for a location.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.659
14 years ago,

39:17.703 --> 39:20.706
Ziva kills her brother Ari.

39:22.185 --> 39:25.101
14 years and one bullet.

39:25.145 --> 39:28.322
Look what it's left in its wake.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.935
ODETTE:
Right or wrong,
every time we act,

39:32.979 --> 39:35.285
something is lost that
we can never regain.

39:36.809 --> 39:38.811
Don't you agree?

39:40.769 --> 39:44.556
I'm not going to apologize, if
that's why you called me here.

39:44.599 --> 39:48.037
Do you know why I asked you
to retrieve that drive?

39:48.081 --> 39:49.952
You said Ziva
doesn't do well in crowds.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.432
I did say that.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.043
And yet I'm fully aware
her anxiety

39:54.087 --> 39:55.654
could strike at any moment.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.220
Crowd or empty room.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.530
So you knew she was too proud
to call Gibbs herself,

40:02.574 --> 40:04.402
but she needed him.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.839
And, in a way,
he needed her, too.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.972
They had unfinished business
to address.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.105
Why involve me at all?

40:12.148 --> 40:14.194
Why not just call Gibbs?

40:16.109 --> 40:18.328
Two birds with one stone,
my dear.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.464
I had a performance
to evaluate.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.815
Took a lot of guts to walk away
from me with that drive.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.820
I see a certain...

40:31.864 --> 40:34.301
promise in you, Agent Bishop.

40:36.129 --> 40:38.087
I'd like
to offer you some...

40:38.131 --> 40:40.438
specialized training,

40:40.481 --> 40:43.528
if you'd be interested.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.097
[toy's siren blaring]

40:51.710 --> 40:54.321
[door opens, closes]

40:57.542 --> 41:00.066
How's the arm?Nothing serious.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.241
I'll live.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.808
Phineas?

41:02.851 --> 41:05.550
He's asleep upstairs.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.729
I haven't told him yet.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.996
[sighs]

41:17.039 --> 41:19.607
[sighs heavily]

41:21.217 --> 41:24.830
After you left my office,
I did what you said.

41:24.873 --> 41:28.137
I called Tony and I told him
to take Tali into hiding.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.923
For everyone's safety,
I do not know where they went.

41:30.966 --> 41:33.839
Once they are there
and secure, Tony...

41:33.882 --> 41:35.971
will make contact with me.

41:36.015 --> 41:38.408
You looking for a place
to stay till then?

41:39.671 --> 41:41.150
[laughs]

41:51.073 --> 41:53.554
I should not
have let you mourn me.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.863
I should have come to you
after the explosion.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.125
I should have trusted you.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.214
You would have
been there for me.

42:03.695 --> 42:06.045
Like you were there tonight.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.308
It cost a lot.

42:14.314 --> 42:18.100
But I will never regret
taking that shot.

42:19.885 --> 42:23.149
Like I'll never regret
the one I took for you, either.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.328
PHINEAS [in distance]:
Jethro Gibbs?

42:28.371 --> 42:30.330
Are you there?
