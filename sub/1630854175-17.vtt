WEBVTT

00:00.828 --> 00:02.726
<i>Previously...</i> Matt: Abril Rodas.

00:02.726 --> 00:05.212
She was La Fiera's
right-hand woman until La Fiera

00:05.212 --> 00:06.523
ended up with
a bullet in her heart.

00:06.523 --> 00:07.662
Unlike La Fiera,

00:07.662 --> 00:10.389
I kill only when it's
strategically advantageous.

00:10.389 --> 00:13.116
Her <i>sicarios</i> hit
three competing gangs

00:13.116 --> 00:15.222
at the same time she
cut down Elijah's crew.

00:15.222 --> 00:16.878
Elijah, he's expanding.

00:16.878 --> 00:18.949
- We can help each other.
- I'm listening.

00:18.949 --> 00:20.744
We know he teamed up
with Abril. What else?

00:20.744 --> 00:23.851
DEA just intercepted a call
to Daylin Morales from Abril,

00:23.851 --> 00:25.197
ordering her to come
to Los Angeles.

00:25.197 --> 00:26.923
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

00:26.923 --> 00:28.752
Feds tracked her entering
the country two hours ago.

00:28.752 --> 00:30.582
Pleasure doing business
with you.

00:30.582 --> 00:31.962
Police! Get on the ground!

00:35.173 --> 00:38.314
Get on the ground!
Do it now!

00:38.314 --> 00:41.075
Abril,
the feds have Elijah's phone.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.663
With Elijah in jail,

00:42.663 --> 00:44.078
all the drug dealers
he had under his thumb

00:44.078 --> 00:45.252
are gonna be
climbing for his crown.

00:45.252 --> 00:47.392
I got a veritable
library over here.

00:47.392 --> 00:49.152
What's your jam?

00:49.152 --> 00:51.189
You got
any revenge stories?

01:25.292 --> 01:27.397
Oh, you messed
up now, old man.

01:27.397 --> 01:30.918
Pow!

01:30.918 --> 01:35.302
I am inviting your king
to a party at my house.

01:35.302 --> 01:38.857
Even after all those years,
you still haven't learned

01:38.857 --> 01:42.205
that chess
is a game of tactics,

01:42.205 --> 01:44.656
not t-t-talking.

01:44.656 --> 01:46.485
Okay, you were not complaining

01:46.485 --> 01:48.901
all those years
I played you in prison.

01:48.901 --> 01:53.423
Yeah, well, that's because
those visits, our games,

01:53.423 --> 01:55.287
they got me through it.

01:55.287 --> 01:59.395
But that doesn't mean that
I'm not going to whoop your butt

01:59.395 --> 02:02.052
on the celebration
of my homecoming day.

02:02.052 --> 02:03.226
Bring it, old man.

02:03.226 --> 02:05.297
Bam!

02:05.297 --> 02:06.919
Oh!

02:09.888 --> 02:11.993
32 years'
worth of games

02:11.993 --> 02:14.272
and we never missed
an anniversary.

02:14.272 --> 02:15.652
Always found a way.

02:15.652 --> 02:20.933
You know, Benny Reynolds reached
out to me the other day.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.902
He's in hospice now.

02:23.902 --> 02:26.422
Good.
Can't wait for him to die.

02:26.422 --> 02:27.768
Oh, Simone,
come on now...

02:27.768 --> 02:29.149
No, no Simone, nothing.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.255
Benny Reynolds
was a crooked cop

02:32.255 --> 02:33.360
who framed you,

02:33.360 --> 02:36.432
had you incarcerated
for most of my childhood.

02:36.432 --> 02:38.019
What does he want?

02:38.019 --> 02:40.815
For you to absolve him
of his deathbed guilt?

02:40.815 --> 02:43.611
Mm-hmm.
And I am considering it.

02:43.611 --> 02:44.923
You-- I--

02:48.858 --> 02:51.550
Good God,
you look amazing.

02:51.550 --> 02:53.725
I feel way overdressed.

02:53.725 --> 02:56.452
I think I have a way
to solve that.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.946
We are going to spend
the entire day in bed.

03:07.946 --> 03:10.224
Questions, comments, concerns?

03:10.224 --> 03:12.606
Uh...
Didn't think so.

03:18.405 --> 03:20.579
Whoa. What's wrong?

03:20.579 --> 03:22.581
No, I just...
Nothing. Nothing.

03:22.581 --> 03:23.789
There's something.

03:23.789 --> 03:25.205
I-- It can wait.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.415
Obviously, it can't.

03:28.415 --> 03:30.658
Why-- What's happening?

03:30.658 --> 03:32.246
I don't want to
make it a thing.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.663
It's just, we said
we were gonna talk about this.

03:35.663 --> 03:37.907
Right.
About us.

03:37.907 --> 03:39.805
I mean, do we really
have to define it?

03:44.534 --> 03:46.191
One minute.

03:46.191 --> 03:47.572
Yeah.

03:47.572 --> 03:49.436
Oh, uh...

03:49.436 --> 03:50.747
Morning, Matt.

03:52.577 --> 03:54.026
Yeah.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.269
Yeah,
I'll be right there.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.891
Mm-hmm.

03:59.687 --> 04:00.930
- You have to go in? Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:00.930 --> 04:03.070
I'm so sorry.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.072
You flew all the way here
from D.C.

04:05.072 --> 04:07.385
Hmm.

04:07.385 --> 04:08.627
Are we okay?

04:08.627 --> 04:10.871
Yeah.
You sure?

04:10.871 --> 04:13.667
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:20.915 --> 04:23.263
Why you mean-mugging
this fine brother?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.747
He owe you money?

04:24.747 --> 04:26.438
He's DEA.
You know what that stands for?

04:26.438 --> 04:28.302
"Don't Expect Anything."

04:28.302 --> 04:30.753
They're reckless cowboys, not
serious investigators like us.

04:30.753 --> 04:33.031
So don't go all Simone,
trying to make friends.

04:33.031 --> 04:34.377
Remember
what team you're on.

04:34.377 --> 04:36.310
Got it.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.657
Hey, sorry about
your day with Atlas.

04:38.657 --> 04:40.797
That sucks.
How's my boy doing, anyway?

04:40.797 --> 04:42.454
So good.

04:42.454 --> 04:44.974
Morning! Thank you all
for coming in so quickly.

04:44.974 --> 04:46.803
Our task force has been given
a shot of adrenaline

04:46.803 --> 04:48.460
from our friends at LAPD.

04:48.460 --> 04:51.429
Last night,
they arrested Elijah Stone.

04:51.429 --> 04:53.638
Now, they recovered a burner
cell that he's been using

04:53.638 --> 04:57.435
to coordinate his drug shipments
with his supplier in Guatemala,

04:57.435 --> 04:59.299
Abril Rodas.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.439
Now, as we all know, she's been
in hiding for months, but--

05:01.439 --> 05:03.406
I'll take it
from here, Matt.

05:03.406 --> 05:05.650
For you feds who are new
to this task force,

05:05.650 --> 05:07.859
I'm SAC Owen Ripley.

05:07.859 --> 05:10.413
This is
Special Agent Xavier Lind.

05:10.413 --> 05:13.347
Now, our operatives in Guatemala
captured drone footage

05:13.347 --> 05:17.489
of Abril and her first
lieutenant, Daylin Morales.

05:17.489 --> 05:20.147
They're holed up in a compound
outside the city of San Marcos.

05:20.147 --> 05:23.392
Thanks to the DEA's relationship
with the Guatemalan government,

05:23.392 --> 05:25.290
we've been given permission
to perform an extraction.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.981
Shouldn't be
too complicated.

05:26.981 --> 05:29.294
This isn't
a well-fortified location.

05:29.294 --> 05:31.331
Honestly, we don't know
why Abril chose it.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.126
According to FBI sources,
that was Abril's mother's home.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.852
She died a week ago.
Abril was by her side.

05:35.852 --> 05:37.371
And that matters why?

05:37.371 --> 05:39.131
Well, it speaks
to her state of mind.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.617
It could potentially
make her vulnerable.

05:41.617 --> 05:42.721
Know your target.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.654
That's the best way
to catch them.

05:44.654 --> 05:47.899
Good, so we're putting together
a small team

05:47.899 --> 05:49.556
to head to Guatemala
for this mission.

05:49.556 --> 05:51.143
Wheels up in 30.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.731
Carter, Simone, you're
with me in Guatemala.

05:52.731 --> 05:54.733
Laura, Brendon, I want you to
follow up with Elijah Stone.

05:54.733 --> 05:56.252
With him in lockup,

05:56.252 --> 05:57.805
there is a power vacuum
that needs to be filled.

05:57.805 --> 05:59.393
Let's crush this drug operation

05:59.393 --> 06:01.844
from both sides
of the border once and for all.

06:06.469 --> 06:08.229
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah?

06:08.229 --> 06:10.162
I know an excellent profiler
who happens to be in town.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.923
Maybe he can help us analyze
Elijah and his crew.

06:11.923 --> 06:13.234
Who?
Special Agent
Mark Atlas.

06:13.234 --> 06:15.236
No, no, no.
He's on vacation, not available.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.721
To see you,
but you're stuck here,

06:16.721 --> 06:18.274
so why not have him
be stuck with you?

06:18.274 --> 06:20.932
So what do you think, boss?
Can Atlas come and play?

06:20.932 --> 06:22.796
If it helps get the job done, fine.

06:22.796 --> 06:25.281
Yes.
With me.

06:25.281 --> 06:27.283
- What are you doing?
- Saving your bae-cation.

06:27.283 --> 06:29.009
Oh, look.
He texted back.

06:29.009 --> 06:30.735
"I'm in." Great.
Oh--

06:30.735 --> 06:32.840
So now you can spend
some time with your man

06:32.840 --> 06:34.221
and solve a case.

06:34.221 --> 06:36.223
You're welcome.

06:36.223 --> 06:39.226
- You're wrong about this.
- Excuse me?

06:39.226 --> 06:43.437
Carter, this crooked cop
used his badge and a lie

06:43.437 --> 06:46.958
to put my daddy in prison
for a crime he did not commit.

06:46.958 --> 06:50.030
He had decades
to ask for forgiveness.

06:50.030 --> 06:51.445
But now,
on his deathbed,

06:51.445 --> 06:53.620
he wants to come
with a pathetic apology?

06:53.620 --> 06:55.622
- I think not.
- Could be worth hearing.

06:55.622 --> 06:58.279
Close a painful chapter,
help <i>you</i> to move on.

06:58.279 --> 07:00.281
- I have moved on.
- You sure about that?

07:00.281 --> 07:03.181
- I'm sure about that.
- Grudges only hurt people
who can't let go, Simone.

07:03.181 --> 07:05.390
Well...

07:05.390 --> 07:07.219
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.083
Why is he flying with us?
Doesn't the DEA have planes?

07:09.083 --> 07:10.568
Yeah, and they're
a lot nicer than this.

07:10.568 --> 07:12.086
Feel free
to step off,

07:12.086 --> 07:13.294
preferably when
we're at 30,000 feet.

07:13.294 --> 07:14.986
Carter,
you know the DEA

07:14.986 --> 07:16.608
has jurisdictional command
in Guatemala,

07:16.608 --> 07:19.128
which is why Special Agent Lind
is with us.

07:19.128 --> 07:20.267
So everyone, play nice.

07:20.267 --> 07:22.165
Hello.
I'm Simone.

07:22.165 --> 07:24.167
Pleasure to meet you, Simone.

07:24.167 --> 07:26.100
By the way, your training
agent is an idiot.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.171
Okay, did I not
just say to play nice?

07:28.171 --> 07:30.104
I'm the idiot because I made it
through the FBI academy?

07:30.104 --> 07:31.451
You couldn't hack it.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.176
So that's where you guys
know each other from.

07:33.176 --> 07:34.971
Lind, you wanted
to be in the FBI?

07:34.971 --> 07:36.904
Till I came to my senses.

07:36.904 --> 07:39.148
Especially since Carter
was such a miserable roommate.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.495
What?
I was neat, courteous--

07:41.495 --> 07:43.463
Always thought
you were better than me.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.120
I tried to lift you up!
And for that, you blew me off.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.088
And guess what.
I'm doing it again.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.646
And you want to talk to <i>me</i>
about grudges?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.754
This isn't exactly
how you wanted

07:58.754 --> 08:00.687
to spend your day
with Laura, but hey,

08:00.687 --> 08:02.447
at least you get to spend
some time with her, right?

08:02.447 --> 08:04.345
- I appreciate you, man.
- Not as much
as I appreciate you.

08:04.345 --> 08:05.519
Alright, enough with
the bromance.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.141
Oh, sorry.

08:07.141 --> 08:08.971
Marshals are bringing Elijah
in from prison.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.870
In the meantime, let's build
profiles on his crew.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.631
- Okay.
- Now, with Elijah gone,

08:13.631 --> 08:15.667
one of these guys
is going to take control.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.359
I think it's Hazy. He's been
his top lieutenant for years.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.258
My money's on Idalo.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.017
if you don't mind?

08:21.017 --> 08:24.124
Okay.

08:24.124 --> 08:27.990
There. They grew up together.
There's deep trust, loyalty.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.612
Their relationship
is defined.

08:29.612 --> 08:30.958
Atlas,
that's a very good point.

08:30.958 --> 08:32.615
I don't think it is.

08:32.615 --> 08:34.652
Idalo might have been
his childhood friend,

08:34.652 --> 08:37.378
but Hazy is his right hand,
knows how to run the business.

08:37.378 --> 08:39.588
Idalo's more of
a muscle,

08:39.588 --> 08:42.142
whereas Hazy has proven he can
thrive in Elijah's absence.

08:42.142 --> 08:45.145
I mean,
when you put it that way...

08:45.145 --> 08:46.871
Yeah, that--
that makes sense.

08:46.871 --> 08:47.906
See? Brendon
agrees with me.

08:47.906 --> 08:51.254
Actually,
we're both wrong.

08:51.254 --> 08:52.566
If we want to dismantle
Elijah's crew,

08:52.566 --> 08:53.981
we need to
find the weakest link--

08:53.981 --> 08:55.224
the lieutenant
we can turn.

08:55.224 --> 08:56.570
This guy.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.884
Dangerous,
but scared of commitment.

08:59.884 --> 09:01.471
Four children
by three different women.

09:01.471 --> 09:04.095
Seems like he runs
when things get serious.

09:04.095 --> 09:06.580
Or maybe he doesn't
do well under pressure.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.445
Or maybe he deflects and
avoids tough conversations.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.861
Or maybe he just doesn't want
to jeopardize a good thing

09:11.861 --> 09:14.036
by overanalyzing it
to death.

09:14.036 --> 09:16.417
Hey, are we still talking
about the case?

09:16.417 --> 09:17.867
Of course. Yep.

09:19.662 --> 09:23.942
♪ Sera, sera

09:23.942 --> 09:26.117
♪ Puedan tocar solo admirar

09:26.117 --> 09:28.464
♪ Yo no quiero oír

09:28.464 --> 09:30.777
♪ Tocas a mi gente

09:30.777 --> 09:31.881
What the hell
took so long?

09:31.881 --> 09:34.021
Briefings and protocols.

09:34.021 --> 09:35.885
Waste of time.

09:35.885 --> 09:38.301
Back in the day, DEA could storm
gates without interference.

09:38.301 --> 09:40.890
FAST teams didn't have
to wait for the FBI.

09:40.890 --> 09:42.443
No checks and balances
allowed for corruption,

09:42.443 --> 09:43.755
so those teams
had to go.

09:43.755 --> 09:45.377
Just made us weaker
and the enemy stronger.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.724
Now we got to deal
with all your red tape.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.280
Here's the sit-rep.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.249
Target's compound, access points
on the north and east sides.

09:55.249 --> 09:58.252
We will hit both gates,
neutralize all guards,

09:58.252 --> 09:59.737
and apprehend her.

09:59.737 --> 10:02.015
Lock and load! Moving out!

10:06.260 --> 10:07.917
You know, for someone
so controlled,

10:07.917 --> 10:10.264
you sure played it
fast and loose.

10:10.264 --> 10:11.783
Letting
a personal vendetta

10:11.783 --> 10:14.303
get the best of you
until you lost everything.

10:14.303 --> 10:17.409
You think I've lost

10:17.409 --> 10:19.480
just 'cause I'm sitting here
in this jumpsuit?

10:19.480 --> 10:23.139
Maybe not. I mean,
you do have a wide reach.

10:23.139 --> 10:25.486
I'm sure it'd be easy to
coordinate with Hazy, Idalo,

10:25.486 --> 10:27.454
any of your other lieutenants
from the inside.

10:27.454 --> 10:29.836
How long do you think you can
run your business like this?

10:29.836 --> 10:32.010
Sooner or later, your crew's
going to cut you loose,

10:32.010 --> 10:33.356
find someone new.

10:33.356 --> 10:35.842
No, they know better.
And so do I.

10:35.842 --> 10:37.084
That's why I'm not buying

10:37.084 --> 10:39.155
whatever it is you all
are here to sell.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.675
You sure about that?
Because what we're offering
you is a lifeline.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.883
You find
that burner phone yet?

10:45.610 --> 10:48.613
Is that what...

10:48.613 --> 10:51.409
this is all really about?

10:51.409 --> 10:53.549
Abril Rodas?

10:53.549 --> 10:57.035
Were you able to trace her
location in Guatemala with it?

10:57.035 --> 10:59.520
You probably got a whole team
down there right now,

10:59.520 --> 11:03.110
ready to storm her castle.

11:03.110 --> 11:05.630
You actually think
you're going to get her,

11:05.630 --> 11:07.114
but you're thinking like feds.

11:07.114 --> 11:08.944
How should we
be thinking?

11:08.944 --> 11:10.877
Like a woman who was dropped
on her head as a child.

11:10.877 --> 11:12.637
You know about that, right?

11:12.637 --> 11:14.052
Abril's origin story?

11:14.052 --> 11:15.882
Suffering head trauma
doesn't exactly

11:15.882 --> 11:17.884
make one
a master strategist.

11:17.884 --> 11:21.232
No, but staying awake
24/7 does.

11:21.232 --> 11:23.510
The woman doesn't sleep, y'all.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.615
So what do you think she does
with all that spare time?

11:25.615 --> 11:27.548
Bravo Team approaching.
No sign of hostiles.

11:27.548 --> 11:29.240
Plans. Strategizes.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.621
Copy.
Alpha team on the move.

11:31.621 --> 11:35.729
She would have heard
what's happened to me.

11:35.729 --> 11:39.975
You don't think she's going
to see y'all coming?

11:39.975 --> 11:42.391
She's gonna have something
real special

11:42.391 --> 11:43.703
waiting for your friends.

11:45.394 --> 11:46.291
Bravo team in position.

11:48.984 --> 11:50.295
On my mark, we move.

11:51.262 --> 11:53.989
Come on, Matt.

11:53.989 --> 11:55.645
Pick up, pick up,
pick up.

11:55.645 --> 11:56.819
Three, two, one,
breach!

12:13.077 --> 12:13.871
Clear!

12:16.390 --> 12:17.598
Hallway clear!

12:17.598 --> 12:19.739
Clear!

12:21.775 --> 12:23.087
Third room clear!

12:23.087 --> 12:24.433
Clear!

12:24.433 --> 12:25.917
<i>All clear.</i>

12:25.917 --> 12:28.057
It's a dry hole.
No one's here.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.547
What is it, Simone?
What is it?

12:57.604 --> 13:00.572
The devil's got nothing
on Abril.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.058
Alright,
who is the priest?

13:03.058 --> 13:05.060
<i>Father Juan Castillo.
He's local.</i>

13:05.060 --> 13:06.061
Is there any significance
to the writing

13:06.061 --> 13:07.752
<i>Campo de Sangre</i>
on the floor?

13:07.752 --> 13:09.340
That means "Field of Blood,"
right?

13:09.340 --> 13:12.722
It was the field where Judas
went to hang himself

13:12.722 --> 13:14.448
after he betrayed Jesus.

13:14.448 --> 13:17.935
His stomach was open
and his intestines spilled out.

13:17.935 --> 13:19.626
Laura, Atlas,
initial thoughts?

13:19.626 --> 13:21.317
Just one--

13:21.317 --> 13:23.250
it doesn't fit Abril's
profile to display her kills.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.666
She's utilitarian,
not an exhibitionist.

13:25.666 --> 13:27.358
Okay, well, then,
why the break in her MO?

13:27.358 --> 13:29.670
No idea,
but maybe it has something to do

13:29.670 --> 13:31.362
with the symbol that she painted
with the victim's blood?

13:31.362 --> 13:34.020
It's called Miquiztli.
It signifies death.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.607
Kind of redundant
for this tableau.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.954
A little trite,
to be honest.

13:36.954 --> 13:38.990
It's an ancient
Aztec glyph.

13:38.990 --> 13:40.440
At least the skull is.
This pitchfork doesn't belong.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.546
So Abril added her own
little artistic flourish?

13:43.546 --> 13:45.548
Okay, we're going to
wrap things up here,

13:45.548 --> 13:47.516
see if Abril or Daylin
left any breadcrumbs

13:47.516 --> 13:48.793
that we could follow, okay?

13:48.793 --> 13:50.381
How did it go with Elijah?

13:50.381 --> 13:51.692
Well, he didn't give us
much of anything,

13:51.692 --> 13:53.039
but we did identify
a lieutenant

13:53.039 --> 13:54.385
with the least
amount of loyalty.

13:54.385 --> 13:56.801
Tito Morales.
LAPD just picked him up for us.

13:56.801 --> 13:57.871
<i>Okay, see what
you can get out of him.</i>

13:57.871 --> 14:00.115
So, what do
we do now, boss?

14:00.115 --> 14:02.462
We just get back on the jet
empty-handed?

14:02.462 --> 14:05.120
No, no, no, no. Remember
what Laura said about Abril.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.743
She's not the type to make
statements with her kills.

14:07.743 --> 14:09.572
Right, we need to find out
what's motivating her,

14:09.572 --> 14:11.298
since clearly, it's not
business as usual.

14:11.298 --> 14:13.369
We find out why,
we might find her.

14:13.369 --> 14:16.027
I need to speak to that man's
next of kin right away.

14:17.235 --> 14:19.548
So things are good
with you and Antoinette?

14:19.548 --> 14:21.239
Yeah.
Nice. Nice.

14:21.239 --> 14:24.484
You guys exclusive,
like, boyfriend-girlfriend?

14:24.484 --> 14:27.383
Uh, I don't know. We haven't
really talked about it.

14:27.383 --> 14:29.316
Maybe we should.

14:29.316 --> 14:31.871
Maybe you shouldn't. Antoinette
might not like labels.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.390
That'd be a shame.
Labels are great.

14:34.390 --> 14:37.255
Lets you know what to expect,
where you stand.

14:37.255 --> 14:38.808
Maybe if Brendon
would pay attention,

14:38.808 --> 14:40.258
he'd know where he stood.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.433
Ooh, first lovers' quarrel.
Nice.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.711
You know, I once did
a Lifetime movie

14:44.711 --> 14:46.195
about two rival psychiatrists

14:46.195 --> 14:47.956
who got together,
started dating.

14:47.956 --> 14:50.372
"My Couch or Yours,"
it was called. Terrible movie.

14:50.372 --> 14:53.064
But great relationship advice.
You wanna hear it?

14:53.064 --> 14:55.446
Absolutely not.
Can we stop talking?

14:55.446 --> 14:56.481
Well--
Goes for everyone.

15:01.107 --> 15:03.937
Priest's sister
is here, Mayra Perez.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.283
Okay, look,
here's the deal.

15:05.283 --> 15:06.767
If we all go over there,
she's going to get spooked,

15:06.767 --> 15:08.390
so I'll go over
with Simone.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.736
You do your thing.
Might put her at ease.

15:09.736 --> 15:10.771
Got your back, boss.

15:10.771 --> 15:12.566
Carter,
you stay here with Lind.

15:12.566 --> 15:14.568
If Trent gets a lead on Abril,
you come and get us, understand?

15:27.754 --> 15:29.998
I know who
you Americans are.

15:29.998 --> 15:31.931
It's okay if we ask you
questions about your brother?

15:33.139 --> 15:34.899
Did he ever have any problems
with a woman

15:34.899 --> 15:36.797
by the name of
Abril Rodas?

15:36.797 --> 15:39.317
No, Juan was a holy man.

15:39.317 --> 15:41.802
He would have nothing to do
with anyone like her.

15:41.802 --> 15:45.392
Is there anyone
you could think of

15:45.392 --> 15:46.911
that would want to
hurt your brother?

15:46.911 --> 15:48.464
Once Juan became a priest,

15:48.464 --> 15:51.951
he became a man of
love and compassion.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.160
He had no enemies.

15:54.160 --> 15:58.129
What about before he committed
his life to God?

15:58.129 --> 16:00.856
Anyone from his past?

16:00.856 --> 16:05.723
Listen, we want what you want
for your brother-- justice.

16:08.691 --> 16:13.903
This was left on the doorstep
of Juan's church this morning.

16:16.734 --> 16:18.425
San Marcos police badge.

16:18.425 --> 16:21.325
It was Juan's, long ago.

16:24.742 --> 16:25.777
I'm just gonna say it.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.503
We were boys at Quantico,

16:27.503 --> 16:29.264
and you up and quit.

16:29.264 --> 16:31.714
Ghosted me like we never met.
I mean, what was that?

16:31.714 --> 16:33.958
We were the only two brothers
in our class,

16:33.958 --> 16:35.304
going through
the trenches together,

16:35.304 --> 16:38.549
- getting hazed.
- That wasn't hazing, man.

16:38.549 --> 16:42.035
The good old boy instructors
didn't want us there.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.313
With their less-than-subtle
racist comments,

16:44.313 --> 16:46.212
messing with our gun sights
before range exams.

16:46.212 --> 16:47.765
And I kept telling you
to shake it off,

16:47.765 --> 16:49.215
look at
the bigger picture.

16:49.215 --> 16:51.113
And work with
racists and homophobes?

16:51.113 --> 16:53.667
No, thank you.
Look, I'm not like you, man.

16:53.667 --> 16:56.567
I can't go along to get along
with people like that.

16:56.567 --> 17:00.398
Abril's dad and Juan were cops
25 years ago here in San Marcos.

17:00.398 --> 17:03.953
Juan became a priest and left
the force after Abril's dad

17:03.953 --> 17:05.472
was murdered by some soldier.

17:05.472 --> 17:07.716
- What soldier?
- Nobody knows.

17:07.716 --> 17:09.718
But he was the one
who ripped baby Abril

17:09.718 --> 17:12.238
from her father's arms
and tossed her aside.

17:12.238 --> 17:14.067
That's how she got
her brain injury.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.931
Made her
who she is today.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.209
She left this along
with Juan's old police badge.

17:18.209 --> 17:19.935
It's another death symbol.

17:19.935 --> 17:21.695
It looks like Abril
is out for revenge.

17:21.695 --> 17:23.076
25 years later?
Why now?

17:23.076 --> 17:24.767
One thing is for sure.

17:24.767 --> 17:28.081
Abril did not kill that priest
like a Judas for nothing.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.428
Maybe back
in their policing days,

17:30.428 --> 17:32.775
Juan betrayed
Abril's dad somehow.

17:32.775 --> 17:34.915
Abril tortured Juan
before killing him.

17:34.915 --> 17:37.228
So she is after
that soldier.

17:37.228 --> 17:39.610
Now, you know if we find
that soldier before she does,

17:39.610 --> 17:42.061
we can catch her.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.408
An informant says Abril
and Daylin boarded a small plane

17:44.408 --> 17:46.065
and flew out
of the country hours ago.

17:46.065 --> 17:50.414
What? They could be anywhere
in the world right now.

18:01.977 --> 18:05.429
Don't you just hate when
the killing is this easy?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.815
All of Elijah's crew were
killed except for Tito.

18:12.815 --> 18:14.541
LAPD picked him up before
he could go to the soiree.

18:14.541 --> 18:17.199
- He's in protective custody.
- Any messages left behind?

18:17.199 --> 18:20.237
None, just .45 auto GSWs
to most victims,

18:20.237 --> 18:21.721
stab wounds to the rest.

18:21.721 --> 18:23.895
Great. That's Abril and Daylin's
M.O. all over.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.105
She's mixing business
with pleasure,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.417
taking down
Elijah's drug operation

18:28.417 --> 18:30.247
<i>and</i> hunting the soldier
who killed her father.

18:30.247 --> 18:32.387
It's going to make her
unfocused, emotional,

18:32.387 --> 18:33.836
prone to mistakes.

18:33.836 --> 18:34.872
We just need to catch
her making one.

18:34.872 --> 18:36.253
Okay, that's it for today.

18:36.253 --> 18:38.082
I got every local agency
in the area looking for them,

18:38.082 --> 18:39.601
so keep your phones on, understood?

18:39.601 --> 18:41.085
Mm-hmm.
Good.

18:43.329 --> 18:44.468
- <i>Tío?
- Yeah?</i>

18:44.468 --> 18:45.676
I see that look.

18:45.676 --> 18:47.333
Want to grab a drink?
Decompress?

18:47.333 --> 18:48.782
It's your date night
with Phoebe.

18:48.782 --> 18:51.337
- You remembered.
- How could I forget?

18:51.337 --> 18:52.786
Your love life is far
more interesting than mine.

18:52.786 --> 18:55.134
Go, have fun.
I'll be fine.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.342
Hey.

18:56.342 --> 18:57.791
Thank you.

19:04.419 --> 19:06.110
Seriously?

19:06.110 --> 19:08.595
After we've been
arguing all day?

19:08.595 --> 19:09.665
Yeah, that's what we do.

19:09.665 --> 19:11.460
We fight hard.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.772
We play hard.

19:12.772 --> 19:14.083
You're trying to
keep it physical

19:14.083 --> 19:15.878
so you can avoid
emotional intimacy

19:15.878 --> 19:17.294
because you're afraid
of getting hurt again.

19:17.294 --> 19:18.640
Don't profile me.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.952
Last time I was here,
I told you I wanted more.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.368
We haven't talked
about it since.

19:22.368 --> 19:25.025
Okay.
- Yeah, let's talk.
- Okay.

19:25.025 --> 19:27.304
What-- What does
that even look like?

19:27.304 --> 19:28.891
You're not going
to move to L.A.

19:28.891 --> 19:30.721
I'm sure as hell not
moving back to D.C.

19:30.721 --> 19:32.688
Most long-distance
relationships, they don't work.

19:32.688 --> 19:34.483
Sometimes they do.

19:34.483 --> 19:37.003
Only when the distance
has an end date, and
we won't have that.

19:37.003 --> 19:39.281
I don't want to be in a
situationship with you anymore.

19:39.281 --> 19:42.042
I want commitment. I want--
I want something real.

19:42.042 --> 19:44.252
I want... something, Laura.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.641
Are you leaving?

19:54.641 --> 19:56.056
We want
different things.

19:56.056 --> 19:59.232
Staying here
isn't gonna change that.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.889
It's just gonna make it
more painful.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.929
I've been thinking...

20:06.929 --> 20:09.242
maybe it's time
we take the next step.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.002
Girl, I am not
moving in with you.

20:11.002 --> 20:14.765
No, I meant like taking a trip
together somewhere.

20:14.765 --> 20:17.388
You thinking fruity drinks
with umbrellas by the beach?

20:17.388 --> 20:20.529
More like refurbished
vintage Airstream trailers

20:20.529 --> 20:22.186
in the woods?

20:22.186 --> 20:24.913
Okay, that sounds awful,
but I'm listening.

20:24.913 --> 20:27.156
This is
everything we wanted.

20:28.606 --> 20:30.090
With Elijah's crew gone,

20:30.090 --> 20:32.507
we can get our own
distribution network running.

20:32.507 --> 20:34.440
<i>Amor?</i>

20:34.440 --> 20:35.441
<i>Mira?</i>
I'm listening.

20:35.441 --> 20:37.097
But you're distracted.

20:37.097 --> 20:38.616
This is serious.

20:38.616 --> 20:41.101
So is finding
my father's killer.

20:41.101 --> 20:42.793
At what cost?

20:42.793 --> 20:46.452
- It's become too risky.
- This is the only way.

20:46.452 --> 20:49.558
And she will lead us
to my father's killer.

20:49.558 --> 20:50.904
Why this girl?

20:50.904 --> 20:53.528
She's Matthew Garza's
niece and assistant,

20:53.528 --> 20:54.874
not a trained agent.

20:54.874 --> 20:57.290
She won't know
to be on the lookout.

20:57.290 --> 21:01.294
Plug the device into her phone
and upload the malware.

21:01.294 --> 21:05.298
Look at them.
Not a care in the world.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.196
I wonder
what that's like.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.129
Boring.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.791
What's the downside?

21:19.933 --> 21:21.935
Well, don't
write it off just yet.

21:21.935 --> 21:23.661
And what
if it's freezing?

21:23.661 --> 21:25.249
That's what blankets
are for.

21:25.249 --> 21:27.665
And body heat.

21:27.665 --> 21:29.978
Mm-hmm.
Keep talking.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.981
There is a fully-loaded bar
in the clubhouse.

21:35.846 --> 21:38.158
Why didn't you lead with that?
Okay. I'm in.

21:38.158 --> 21:40.229
When are you thinking?

21:40.229 --> 21:42.784
Okay, um, well,
I have plans...

21:48.583 --> 21:50.170
That was way too close.

21:50.170 --> 21:51.275
You're pushing our luck
with this.

21:51.275 --> 21:52.587
I don't care.

21:52.587 --> 21:54.209
And that's the problem!

21:54.209 --> 21:55.659
You're willing to sacrifice
everything we've built.

21:55.659 --> 21:57.177
<i>We've</i> built?

21:57.177 --> 21:59.387
I am the one
that took over from La Fiera.

21:59.387 --> 22:02.148
I am the one who has built <i>my</i>
business to what it is today.

22:02.148 --> 22:03.977
And you're about to burn it
to the ground.

22:03.977 --> 22:07.049
And for what?
Your dead <i>papi?</i>

22:07.049 --> 22:09.293
Don't make the same mistake
La Fiera made.

22:09.293 --> 22:10.674
Don't make it personal.

22:13.987 --> 22:16.196
But I have to do this.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.929
Get out.

22:37.804 --> 22:40.082
Good morning,
Papa Bear.

22:40.082 --> 22:42.878
What fresh hell is going on
in the world today?

22:42.878 --> 22:47.227
Well, the big story is about
a man who has decided

22:47.227 --> 22:50.196
he going to visit
Benny Reynolds

22:50.196 --> 22:52.094
at the hospital tonight.

22:52.094 --> 22:56.098
Okay, hold up, don't give me
that face.

22:56.098 --> 22:58.894
I've dedicated myself
to helping

22:58.894 --> 23:02.933
formerly incarcerated folks
find forgiveness,

23:02.933 --> 23:05.487
and I've got to practice
what I preach.

23:05.487 --> 23:09.595
And I'm hoping
that you will join me.

23:09.595 --> 23:13.357
Daddy, I love you
to the moon and back,

23:13.357 --> 23:15.117
but it's a hard pass.

23:15.117 --> 23:17.396
You are one of the most
compassionate people

23:17.396 --> 23:19.121
I know, Simone.

23:19.121 --> 23:22.124
How can you still show
no mercy for this man?

23:22.124 --> 23:24.955
If you want me to show up
for you, I can do that.

23:24.955 --> 23:26.957
But anything else?
Unh-unh.

23:26.957 --> 23:28.441
I'm not packed
for that trip.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.271
And I mean it.

23:31.271 --> 23:32.963
If you change your mind,

23:32.963 --> 23:35.931
I will be at
Saint Stephen's at 7:00.

23:37.519 --> 23:39.314
You gonna say something,

23:39.314 --> 23:42.524
or are you just going to keep
looking at me all weird?

23:42.524 --> 23:44.112
Keep looking
at you weird.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.773
Atlas stayed at my house
last night.

23:49.773 --> 23:52.292
Mm.
Slumber party.

23:54.778 --> 23:56.400
You know, I know
it's none of my business,

23:56.400 --> 23:59.921
but he's really hurting.

23:59.921 --> 24:02.579
And I thought you said
you wanted to be with him.

24:04.408 --> 24:07.238
You're right.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.930
It's none of
your business.

24:10.794 --> 24:12.830
Good, everyone is here.

24:12.830 --> 24:14.556
I couldn't sleep last night,

24:14.556 --> 24:16.109
thinking about the symbol
that Abril left behind.

24:16.109 --> 24:17.663
Now, Atlas seemed to think

24:17.663 --> 24:19.147
that it was too trite for her,
and I agree.

24:19.147 --> 24:20.631
Is he not coming in or what?

24:20.631 --> 24:22.219
- Probably not.
- Okay.

24:22.219 --> 24:23.772
Well, the addition
of the pitchfork

24:23.772 --> 24:25.498
got me thinking, right?

24:25.498 --> 24:28.190
So I did a deep dive and found
that it was a logo used

24:28.190 --> 24:31.642
by the DEA FAST team stationed
in Guatemala in the '90s.

24:31.642 --> 24:33.299
What's a FAST team?

24:33.299 --> 24:35.094
Stands for Foreign Deployed
Advisory and Support Team.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.440
It's like the DEA's
version of Navy SEALs.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.993
Elite teams of cowboys

24:37.993 --> 24:39.857
who pulled off
secret ops in the drug wars,

24:39.857 --> 24:41.514
and some of them
were dirty.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.654
Yeah, money laundering and
conspiring with the very cartels

24:43.654 --> 24:45.622
that they were supposed
to be taking down.

24:45.622 --> 24:47.451
Congress killed their funding
20 years ago.

24:47.451 --> 24:49.867
I tapped into the DEA archives
through my assistant network.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.869
The logo was on patches
worn by a team

24:51.869 --> 24:53.871
working in Guatemala
in 1997.

24:53.871 --> 24:56.184
What-- Is that Trent,
who we worked with?

24:56.184 --> 24:58.013
Yeah, that's him.

24:58.013 --> 25:00.119
Abril's father was a cop

25:00.119 --> 25:02.535
in San Marcos
around this same time.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.711
What if he discovered
that Trent's team was dirty,

25:05.711 --> 25:07.022
and that's what
got him killed?

25:07.022 --> 25:08.714
I'm gonna go find out.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.439
Have them fire up the jet,
destination, San Marcos.

25:10.439 --> 25:11.717
Alright, we'll pack up.

25:11.717 --> 25:13.132
No, this is a solo mission.

25:13.132 --> 25:15.306
If Trent senses an ambush,
he will disappear.

25:15.306 --> 25:16.791
Stay here.

25:25.662 --> 25:27.353
What, you forget
your toothbrush?

25:27.353 --> 25:30.390
We need to talk.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.047
In private.

25:37.846 --> 25:40.366
Abril's Aztec skull
symbol--

25:40.366 --> 25:41.919
you know it, don't you?

25:41.919 --> 25:43.576
I mean, hell, you should.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.613
You wore it on
your FAST team uniform.

25:45.613 --> 25:48.270
You flew all the way down here
to talk about ancient history?

25:48.270 --> 25:50.549
Why did you keep that little
detail to yourself, Trent?

25:52.481 --> 25:54.276
What, now you
want to shut up?

25:54.276 --> 25:55.899
Okay, well, that's fine, 'cause
I already know the answer.

25:55.899 --> 25:58.591
25 years ago,
Abril's dad was a cop here

25:58.591 --> 26:00.075
intent on rooting out corruption,

26:00.075 --> 26:02.112
and a soldier
killed him for it.

26:02.112 --> 26:03.734
Now she's hunting down
the FAST team member

26:03.734 --> 26:05.115
who took out her old man.

26:05.115 --> 26:06.910
Now, you either did it
or you know who did--

26:06.910 --> 26:08.256
You're grasping, <i>gato.</i>

26:08.256 --> 26:10.396
Yeah, and
you are out of time, Trent.

26:10.396 --> 26:14.573
Cut yourself a deal.
If I walk away, you are done.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.574
Alright.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.131
Alright.

26:21.131 --> 26:25.411
I did not kill that girl's
father, I swear.

26:25.411 --> 26:28.034
But I heard rumors.

26:28.034 --> 26:31.106
I don't care about rumors.
Tell me what you <i>saw.</i>

26:31.106 --> 26:34.075
Sometimes I was put on
guard duty

26:34.075 --> 26:36.525
outside a warehouse
in the sticks.

26:36.525 --> 26:37.872
We called it
the Hornet's Nest.

26:39.287 --> 26:41.392
Did someone kill
Abril's father's there?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.947
I didn't see it.

26:43.947 --> 26:48.468
But all high-level wet work
was done by one man.

26:48.468 --> 26:50.091
Who?

26:51.817 --> 26:53.301
<i>The soldier we're
looking for isn't Trent.</i>

26:53.301 --> 26:54.992
<i>It's Owen Ripley.</i>

26:54.992 --> 26:57.408
He's the head of
the damn task force we're on.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.134
That complicates things.

26:59.134 --> 27:01.620
<i>We need to find him, put
him under protective detail,</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:03.829
and figure out
what exactly happened in '97.

27:03.829 --> 27:06.245
Wait,
here's what I don't get.

27:06.245 --> 27:08.661
<i>Why would Abril
leave us breadcrumbs,</i>

27:08.661 --> 27:11.284
knowing that
once we figured it out,

27:11.284 --> 27:14.011
we would find her
father's killer before she did?

27:14.011 --> 27:16.565
She was using us
to get that intel.

27:16.565 --> 27:18.084
That's impossible,

27:18.084 --> 27:19.810
unless they bugged
the building somehow.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.640
No way, there's an obscene
amount of cyber security here.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.987
That's im--

27:23.987 --> 27:26.161
What about us?

27:26.161 --> 27:27.784
What-- What if they
bugged us, like, individually?

27:27.784 --> 27:29.682
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

27:29.682 --> 27:31.270
<i>Has anyone's phone
been out of their possession</i>

27:31.270 --> 27:33.168
<i>in the last 24 hours?</i>

27:33.168 --> 27:35.861
My phone was in my bag
during my date last night.

27:35.861 --> 27:37.345
And I remember this woman,
she sat behind me,

27:37.345 --> 27:40.037
bumped my chair.

27:40.037 --> 27:42.177
Someone installed
malware on my phone!

27:42.177 --> 27:43.696
<i>A listening device.</i>

27:43.696 --> 27:45.042
Oh, God. She can hear
everything we're saying.

27:45.042 --> 27:46.906
<i>Tío,</i> I'm so sorry.

27:52.049 --> 27:55.639
We got him, <i>papi.</i>
We got him.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.231
Did we get a location
on Owen Ripley?

28:01.231 --> 28:02.715
He left his office this morning
and ditched his phone.

28:02.715 --> 28:03.820
Well, what's the DEA saying?

28:03.820 --> 28:05.131
They shut us out, Matt.

28:05.131 --> 28:06.685
They want
to handle it internally,

28:06.685 --> 28:09.826
especially since it was one of
our phones that was compromised.

28:09.826 --> 28:12.552
Yeah, and while they're doing
their internal investigation,

28:12.552 --> 28:14.693
Abril is out here
hunting down Owen.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.142
Which is why
we need to find out

28:16.142 --> 28:18.213
what the DEA knows about
where Owen might have gone.

28:18.213 --> 28:20.077
Well, no one over there
is gonna help us.

28:20.077 --> 28:22.735
What about that
cutie pie Lind, hmm?

28:22.735 --> 28:25.704
Maybe if you're nice for once,
he might hook us up.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.429
- Maybe.
- Call him, Carter.

28:27.429 --> 28:29.259
In the meantime, Simone, I want
you to check on that BOLO.

28:29.259 --> 28:31.295
I want every law enforcement
agency in the Southland

28:31.295 --> 28:33.228
on active search, okay?

28:33.228 --> 28:34.989
You alright?

28:34.989 --> 28:37.439
You sure?
Yeah.

28:37.439 --> 28:40.684
Good, because we're gonna
go hunt down Abril.

28:40.684 --> 28:42.721
Wait, who?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.723
Me?
Yeah, you and me.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.277
You're the one on my team
who got closest to her, right?

28:47.277 --> 28:49.555
Take me to where you had
your date with Phoebe.

28:49.555 --> 28:51.384
Let's go.

28:51.384 --> 28:52.938
We were sitting right
over here, <i>Tío.</i>

28:52.938 --> 28:55.423
Alright, well, this is
a cute place for a date.

28:55.423 --> 28:56.907
Yeah, not so much anymore.

28:56.907 --> 28:58.081
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

28:58.081 --> 29:00.739
It's totally normal
to feel unnerved, okay?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.430
Killers were watching you,
waiting for the right moment

29:02.430 --> 29:03.776
to hack your phone.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.467
That's a violation.

29:05.467 --> 29:07.366
I'm very sorry
that it happened to you.

29:07.366 --> 29:08.643
But with any luck,

29:08.643 --> 29:10.369
they left a trace or two
of themselves behind, right?

29:10.369 --> 29:11.611
Yeah.
Okay.

29:11.611 --> 29:13.234
So the woman in the chair
bumped into me.

29:13.234 --> 29:15.029
That must have been
when she swiped my phone.

29:15.029 --> 29:18.584
Okay, when you
analyze a crime scene,

29:18.584 --> 29:20.206
you always start
from the point of origin,

29:20.206 --> 29:21.794
and then you work
your way outward, right?

29:21.794 --> 29:24.486
And remember, not one piece
of evidence is ever too small.

29:24.486 --> 29:27.075
I once cracked a case just
from grains of Bahamian sand.

29:27.075 --> 29:28.387
You're making that up.

29:28.387 --> 29:29.768
No, honest to Pete.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.599
Another time,
it was exotic hair gel.

29:33.599 --> 29:36.395
Okay. Well, what about
security cameras?

29:36.395 --> 29:38.604
Well, that would be optimal,
but I checked

29:38.604 --> 29:40.606
and there aren't any.

29:40.606 --> 29:41.745
Well, then what's that?

29:41.745 --> 29:42.953
What's what?

29:50.961 --> 29:53.481
So what do you think
we should do with that?

29:53.481 --> 29:55.138
- Call for a warrant.
- There you go.

29:59.970 --> 30:02.593
- Thanks for meeting me.
- How'd you know
I'd help you?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.457
Well, you said it yourself--
even at Quantico,

30:04.457 --> 30:06.563
you didn't go along
to get along.

30:06.563 --> 30:08.737
I don't think you do
to this day.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.015
What can you tell me?

30:10.015 --> 30:11.913
Owen's off the grid.

30:11.913 --> 30:13.570
The bosses
are quietly freaking out.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.192
So he's on the run?

30:15.192 --> 30:16.469
That's what
everyone's saying.

30:16.469 --> 30:17.816
But you don't agree?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.094
Look, I know Owen.

30:20.094 --> 30:21.923
I worked
with him for years.

30:21.923 --> 30:24.098
Despite his rank and
the way he wears a suit,

30:24.098 --> 30:26.376
he is still the same monster
he was in Guatemala.

30:26.376 --> 30:28.619
So he's not a house mouse,
he's a feral animal.

30:28.619 --> 30:29.862
And what do they do
when attacked?

30:29.862 --> 30:32.451
Fight back.

30:32.451 --> 30:33.797
You think he's
going after Abril?

30:33.797 --> 30:36.110
To neutralize the threat, yes.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.767
Then he'll use
his connections inside the DEA

30:38.767 --> 30:40.493
to sweep his past crimes
under the rug.

30:40.493 --> 30:44.532
I know this was a huge risk
to you, career-wise.

30:44.532 --> 30:46.189
I appreciate you
doing it.

30:54.162 --> 30:55.612
Have you talked
to Atlas?

30:55.612 --> 30:57.683
Stay in your lane, Brendon.

30:57.683 --> 30:59.029
You're swerving again.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.070
You know...

31:05.070 --> 31:09.660
that Lifetime movie I did,
the character I played, Larry,

31:09.660 --> 31:12.318
he felt pressure to date
his best friend too, Larisa.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.493
Oh, I'm sorry,
you starred in a movie

31:14.493 --> 31:16.253
with a couple named
Larry and Larisa?

31:16.253 --> 31:17.565
Yeah,
it was very cute.

31:17.565 --> 31:19.256
Anyway,
Larry wanted things

31:19.256 --> 31:22.156
to stay the way
that they were, uncomplicated,

31:22.156 --> 31:23.398
but he was just
lying to himself.

31:23.398 --> 31:24.572
Hey, focus.

31:24.572 --> 31:27.713
Larry loved Larisa.

31:27.713 --> 31:30.854
You know, you have had
the worst acting career ever.

31:30.854 --> 31:32.062
Have you ever
done anything good?

31:32.062 --> 31:33.857
It's no wonder
you became a fed.

31:33.857 --> 31:35.617
I'm going to let
that insult go,

31:35.617 --> 31:37.481
because I know that
you're hurting.

31:40.933 --> 31:45.420
FYI, my IMDB page, legendary.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.112
Matt?
Yeah?

31:47.112 --> 31:48.596
According to Lind,
Owen isn't running.

31:48.596 --> 31:50.253
He's going after Abril
on his own.

31:50.253 --> 31:52.427
How? He has as much intel
into her whereabouts as we do.

31:52.427 --> 31:55.120
So--
Wait a minute.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.880
Elena, the warrant
for the surveillance video--

31:56.880 --> 31:58.295
Why is it taking
so long?

31:58.295 --> 32:00.366
Let me check the case file
from the joint task force.

32:01.678 --> 32:03.369
This is weird.

32:03.369 --> 32:04.888
The warrant was executed
and the surveillance video

32:04.888 --> 32:06.545
uploaded
20 minutes ago.

32:06.545 --> 32:07.684
Why weren't we notified?

32:07.684 --> 32:09.203
Owen still has access,

32:09.203 --> 32:10.963
because he's the head
of the task force.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.137
He must have disabled
our alerts

32:12.137 --> 32:13.414
and bogarted the evidence.

32:13.414 --> 32:15.105
Play it, play it.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.109
That's Abril's car.

32:19.109 --> 32:22.526
You think
we can get a plate?

32:22.526 --> 32:24.321
There it is.

32:24.321 --> 32:25.771
Car's owned by
an offshore corporation.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.566
Address is in Belize,

32:27.566 --> 32:29.948
but the same corp owns an office
building near downtown.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.328

Abril's local hideout.

when you were
a little girl.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.268
You did not deserve

34:23.268 --> 34:25.615
to have your daddy
taken from you like that.

34:25.615 --> 34:28.445
All my life, I never knew
who killed my father.

34:28.445 --> 34:31.138
On my mother's death bed,
she told me

34:31.138 --> 34:33.588
that Father Juan was not allowed
anywhere near her funeral,

34:33.588 --> 34:36.074
and that's when I realized that
he had something to do with it.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.455
My father was going
to do the right thing,

34:38.455 --> 34:41.424
and his best friend
turned him in to this man.

34:41.424 --> 34:43.219
Look...

34:43.219 --> 34:48.534
sweetie, you are holding so
much hate in your heart.

34:48.534 --> 34:52.193
Now, I'm not saying you got
to forgive this man,

34:52.193 --> 34:55.990
but your father sounds like
he was a good man,

34:55.990 --> 35:03.204
and I think you should honor him
by doing it his way.

35:03.204 --> 35:04.792

35:08.416 --> 35:10.280
