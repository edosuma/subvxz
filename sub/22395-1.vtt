This sure is a great way to
see the city, isn't it, Mickey?

00:10.624 --> 00:12.000
It sure is.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.416
And I'm going to make sure
you get to see the whole thing.

00:14.416 --> 00:16.374
Really?
You betcha!

00:17.499 --> 00:20.666
Next stop, Chinatown,
everybody. Chinatown.

00:20.957 --> 00:23.457
Or, as they like to call it
around these parts...

00:25.291 --> 00:26.457
Chinatown.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.541
What do you say we hop off
here and get some dim sum?

00:33.541 --> 00:35.416
Dim sum?
I'd love some!

00:37.749 --> 00:38.749
Oh!

00:45.707 --> 00:46.707
Ooh!

00:50.541 --> 00:51.582
Minnie?

00:51.582 --> 00:53.041
Mickey!

00:54.083 --> 00:55.416
Minnie!

01:02.707 --> 01:03.915
Mickey!

01:23.416 --> 01:24.541
Be right there!

01:50.166 --> 01:51.582
Comin', minnie!

01:55.374 --> 01:56.374
Oh!

02:08.624 --> 02:11.208
Does anybody know
how to drive this thing?

02:11.957 --> 02:15.041
I do. I used to
drive one for a living.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.707
Really?
Sure!

02:16.707 --> 02:20.041
I can't do it without my
instructional pamphlet though.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.707
I keep it right up here.

02:21.707 --> 02:23.208
What the...

02:28.124 --> 02:29.499
Never mind.

02:42.666 --> 02:44.208
Oh!

02:56.666 --> 02:58.083
Don't worry, minnie.
I got it!

02:58.083 --> 02:59.249
No, I got it!
I got it!

02:59.249 --> 03:00.374
I got it!
I got it!

03:00.374 --> 03:01.541
I got it!
I got it!

03:01.541 --> 03:02.541
I got it!
I got it!

03:12.790 --> 03:15.582
Looks like that was
the one that got away.

03:19.832 --> 03:21.541
Oh, Mickey,
look! Look!

03:22.041 --> 03:23.208
See, minnie?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.624
I told you you'd get to
see the whole thing.
