00:02.024 --> 00:03.425
A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.

00:03.459 --> 00:05.293
And then she she asked
me to take her place,

00:05.328 --> 00:07.562
keep the secret, find our real mother

00:07.596 --> 00:09.598
and try to stay alive.

00:09.632 --> 00:12.234
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:12.268 --> 00:15.103
How long could you keep up the lying game?

00:15.138 --> 00:17.239
Bail is denied.

00:17.273 --> 00:19.193
I'm getting pretty good
at telling you two apart.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.209
Emma, I wouldn't trust Sutton.

00:21.244 --> 00:24.045
She may not be as much
on your side as you think.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.181
I never really had a
chance to tell you how sorry

00:26.215 --> 00:27.949
I am for the affair.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.918
- I want you to represent me.
- Theresa,

00:29.952 --> 00:32.119
- I get the "everyone needs representation."
- There's compelling

00:32.155 --> 00:33.989
evidence that he didn't do this.

00:34.023 --> 00:35.791
This has been amazing, Rebecca.

00:35.825 --> 00:36.925
It'll be even more amazing

00:36.959 --> 00:39.528
when you go back to calling me mom.

00:39.562 --> 00:40.796
I never loved her. I love you!

00:40.830 --> 00:42.497
I just want you to know that I'm not

00:42.532 --> 00:43.799
playing some kind of a game here.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.700
I feel the same way.

00:45.735 --> 00:48.270
- You new in town?
- Could be. I'm Jordan.

00:48.304 --> 00:50.384
- Maybe I should introduce myself.
- Maybe you shouldn't.

00:51.674 --> 00:54.109
I'm still in love with
you, and I can't shake it,

00:54.143 --> 00:57.212
and I don't think you can either.

00:57.246 --> 00:58.213
Hi, mom.

00:58.247 --> 00:59.948
Jordan!

01:09.268 --> 01:11.169
So, Jordan's your stepson?

01:11.203 --> 01:13.004
His dad's my ex,

01:13.039 --> 01:14.839
Marvin Lyle.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.875
And when we got divorced, I told Jordan

01:16.909 --> 01:18.910
- that I'd always be there for him.
- Looks like

01:18.944 --> 01:20.812
he's taking you up on your offer.

01:20.846 --> 01:22.013
Yes, an unexpected visit,

01:22.048 --> 01:23.748
which actually might work in our favor.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.084
- Interesting. Tell me more.
- Oh, you'll see.

01:26.118 --> 01:27.852
Meanwhile, Jordan does not know anything

01:27.887 --> 01:29.821
about you, Emma or any of this.

01:29.855 --> 01:32.490
And if he did, there's no
telling what he might do.

01:32.525 --> 01:33.825
Okay.

01:33.859 --> 01:35.827
Jordan's a bit of a wildcard.

01:35.861 --> 01:37.762
And that is the last
thing we need right now.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.517
Well, ordinarily I would say that's exactly

01:39.532 --> 01:41.332
what I need right now, but... 

01:41.367 --> 01:43.501
I've got my hands full
with another cute boy.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.502
Ethan.

01:44.537 --> 01:47.272
Speaking of...

01:47.306 --> 01:49.240
can I borrow these?

01:54.046 --> 01:57.449
So, think you're gonna
be pissed at me, but...

01:57.483 --> 02:00.185
I went to see your dad again.

02:00.219 --> 02:01.886
I know. 'Cause I went, too.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.288
I saw your name on the sign-in sheet.

02:03.322 --> 02:06.024
I still have the same questions.

02:06.058 --> 02:07.292
Did he kill Derek?

02:07.326 --> 02:09.928
Does it have something to
do with my birth mother?

02:09.961 --> 02:11.930
And I want to know why he doesn't think

02:11.964 --> 02:13.231
I should trust Sutton.

02:13.265 --> 02:16.134
He's just so, like,
mysterioso about everything.

02:16.168 --> 02:18.236
What doesn't he want to tell me?

02:18.270 --> 02:20.238
I don't know. He's fishing,

02:20.272 --> 02:22.040
hoping you'll tell him.

02:22.074 --> 02:24.743
Hey. Act casual.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.077
What the hell? Just...

02:26.112 --> 02:27.879
Give us a sec, Thay. Girl talk.

02:29.882 --> 02:32.016
Cute. You guys are so fit.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.818
What's the big emergency, Sutton?

02:33.853 --> 02:35.053
I'm turning my life around.

02:35.087 --> 02:37.689
I've decided that I'm going to be

02:37.723 --> 02:40.992
- honest about everything except the twins.
- What prompted this?

02:41.026 --> 02:43.928
Ethan, actually. We've
just been connecting again,

02:43.963 --> 02:46.464
you know, like we did
up at the ranch and...

02:46.499 --> 02:47.632
well, the other night,

02:47.666 --> 02:49.701
we had this really intense moment, and...

02:49.735 --> 02:53.304
I don't want to follow through
until I get your blessing.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.606
You guys are broken up, right?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.175
And you're totally into Thayer.

02:57.209 --> 02:59.210
Thayer and I are just friends.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.045
Oh, come on.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.949
I know more than anybody
how amazing Thayer is.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.885
He's smart and supportive

03:06.919 --> 03:09.053
and... and sweet. He's so sweet.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.989
You guys are perfect for each other!

03:11.023 --> 03:12.824
- Thanks.
- So it's totally cool

03:12.858 --> 03:14.058
if Ethan and I give in

03:14.093 --> 03:16.628
to the obvious chemistry between us?

03:18.798 --> 03:20.865
Yeah, I am...

03:20.900 --> 03:23.468
so fine.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.470
Sutton, he is all yours.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.605
Oh! I'm so glad we're getting along.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.441
Thank you. Bye!

04:03.709 --> 04:05.443
It's Ted.

04:05.477 --> 04:07.512
I'm so sorry, I just... 

04:07.546 --> 04:09.614
Look, it doesn't matter what
happened all those years ago...

04:09.648 --> 04:11.683
I love you and...

04:11.717 --> 04:12.877
Please just let me explain...

04:12.885 --> 04:14.619
I'm just trying to save my family...

04:16.555 --> 04:18.690
Oh! Honey, I'm so sorry.

04:18.724 --> 04:20.591
- I didn't know you were there.
- At some point,

04:20.625 --> 04:22.527
- you're going to have to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, I tried,

04:22.561 --> 04:23.828
and that turned into a public disaster,

04:23.863 --> 04:27.665
which hurt no one more
than it hurt you, s... so...

04:27.700 --> 04:30.869
Then maybe you should
try talking in private.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.503
How about marriage counseling?

04:32.538 --> 04:34.439
An objective third party

04:34.473 --> 04:36.875
could really help, even if
it's just to act as a referee.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.710
You want us to go to therapy?

04:38.744 --> 04:40.712
What, you think there's
some sort of stigma?

04:40.746 --> 04:42.814
I don't, but you certainly do.

04:42.848 --> 04:45.516
You always refused when I suggested it.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.585
Well, not anymore.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.789
I have a lot of friends whose
parents have benefited from it.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.492
- Really?
- Look, you have two kids,

04:54.526 --> 04:56.661
which means whether or not
you and dad get back together,

04:56.695 --> 04:58.529
you're at least going
to have to communicate.

05:19.685 --> 05:20.852
Hey.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.388
Uh, is it cool if I leave my bike here?

05:23.422 --> 05:25.456
Only one who might steal it is me.

05:26.558 --> 05:27.659
You know you're jumping a tooth?

05:27.693 --> 05:29.627
You need a new cam chain tensioner.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.496
You know, I thought I heard something.

05:31.530 --> 05:34.465
But I just ride 'em, I don't fix 'em.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.136
I think you should talk to mom about it,

05:38.170 --> 05:41.205
and let her know how important
going to therapy is to you.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.274
Okay, can I not have two seconds

05:43.309 --> 05:46.344
to regroup after my fairway fest meltdown?

05:46.378 --> 05:48.046
Well, we don't really have time.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.881
Because marriages that aren't saved

05:49.915 --> 05:51.950
within the first 48 hours of a breakup

05:51.984 --> 05:54.085
are 50% less likely to be saved at all?

05:54.119 --> 05:56.754
No, but this family means everything to me,

05:56.789 --> 05:58.122
and I just want to do something.

05:58.237 --> 05:59.937
So, I got enough tools

05:59.972 --> 06:02.073
in my place, if you wanted
me to fix that for you.

06:02.107 --> 06:05.009
Or you're just trying to keep your mind

06:05.044 --> 06:07.111
off the ghost of boyfriends past.

06:07.146 --> 06:08.079
Thanks, man.

06:08.113 --> 06:09.747
Yeah.

06:09.782 --> 06:11.949
It has nothing to do with him.

06:11.984 --> 06:13.885
We could go the other way.

06:15.754 --> 06:17.688
Screw that.

06:18.824 --> 06:19.857
Hey.

06:19.892 --> 06:21.926
Laurel, right?

06:21.960 --> 06:23.895
Uh, heard you played amazing last night.

06:23.929 --> 06:25.730
Jordan.

06:25.764 --> 06:27.665
Hello?

06:27.699 --> 06:29.667
Did you forget that I
live at your house now?

06:29.701 --> 06:32.437
Why didn't you wake me?
I am majorly hungover,

06:32.471 --> 06:34.372
and I'm gonna hurl any moment.

06:35.474 --> 06:36.607
Hi.

06:36.642 --> 06:38.309
Hi.

06:38.343 --> 06:39.610
You go to Arroyo?

06:39.645 --> 06:41.612
I do now.

06:41.647 --> 06:43.281
Wait, you guys know each other?

06:43.315 --> 06:47.452
We kind of, um, met last night at the club.

06:47.486 --> 06:49.120
Jordan.

06:49.154 --> 06:50.354
Mads.

06:50.389 --> 06:52.023
Nice to meet you.

06:52.057 --> 06:53.124
Again.

06:53.158 --> 06:54.926
Mm.

06:55.929 --> 06:58.763
I got to bolt. Total dork,

06:58.797 --> 07:00.698
but my step-mom is inside signing me up.

07:00.732 --> 07:03.668
You know, it's kind of a bummer
transferring middle of the year,

07:03.702 --> 07:04.902
but...

07:04.937 --> 07:06.871
Oh, there she is.

07:09.475 --> 07:11.676
Rebecca Sewell is your stepmother?

07:11.710 --> 07:14.745
Yeah. You know her?

07:14.780 --> 07:19.517
I'm telling you, that woman is framing me.

07:19.551 --> 07:24.122
Either Rebecca put the tire
iron in the golf bag herself,

07:24.156 --> 07:25.356
or she had somebody else do it.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.258
You got to figure out who that person was.

07:27.292 --> 07:28.993
The only fingerprints on the murder weapon

07:29.027 --> 07:30.294
are yours and Derek's.

07:30.329 --> 07:32.964
Well, that's why you got to
check the prints on the bag.

07:32.998 --> 07:36.934
Cross-check them with Rebecca,
Sutton Mercer and Thayer.

07:36.969 --> 07:38.136
Okay.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.737
Relax.

07:39.771 --> 07:40.838
Relax?!

07:40.873 --> 07:41.939
I'm in prison.

07:41.974 --> 07:44.775
Get me out.

07:46.778 --> 07:49.514
So, it's Mads, huh?

07:49.548 --> 07:50.815
This is crazy.

07:50.849 --> 07:52.450
I was crazy.

07:52.484 --> 07:54.652
I was completely drunk,

07:54.686 --> 07:56.454
and now I'm completely embarrassed,

07:56.488 --> 07:58.589
not to mention skeeved out by the fact

07:58.624 --> 08:01.425
that I randomly hooked up
with my new stepbrother.

08:02.528 --> 08:04.295
Alec Rybak is your dad?

08:04.329 --> 08:05.363
Yep.

08:06.431 --> 08:07.431
Hello?

08:07.466 --> 08:09.033
Hi. It's Theresa.

08:09.067 --> 08:11.369
I have a message from your father.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.970
He wants to see you.

08:13.005 --> 08:15.006
With Thayer?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.175
No. Just you.

08:24.650 --> 08:25.850
Let me guess.

08:25.884 --> 08:27.618
Bike porn?

08:27.653 --> 08:28.920
I wish.

08:28.954 --> 08:30.788
It's a history paper.

08:31.924 --> 08:33.491
Well, that's a first.

08:33.525 --> 08:34.558
Since when does Ethan Whitehorse

08:34.592 --> 08:36.794
give a rat's ass about European

08:36.828 --> 08:40.298
agrarian societies of the 1800s?

08:40.332 --> 08:42.433
Since I got put on academic probation.

08:42.467 --> 08:44.202
Which could send me back to juvie.

08:44.236 --> 08:46.604
Shut up. I thought you just
had to keep a "C" average.

08:46.638 --> 08:48.472
You know, that's kind of hard to do

08:48.507 --> 08:50.508
when you're skipping town
and hiding out on a ranch,

08:50.542 --> 08:52.376
getting thrown into jail.

08:52.411 --> 08:54.979
Not to mention breaking
into houses with you. Mm.

08:55.013 --> 08:56.214
Yeah, that was fun.

08:56.248 --> 08:57.915
But Alec's behind bars,

08:57.950 --> 09:00.117
so from where I sit, it
was definitely worth it.

09:00.152 --> 09:02.086
Well, just tell that to my parole officer.

09:05.857 --> 09:07.024
Isn't that... ?

09:07.059 --> 09:08.659
His name is Jordan.

09:08.694 --> 09:09.894
He's Rebecca's stepson.

09:11.863 --> 09:14.465
And your new BFF?

09:14.499 --> 09:15.766
Guys don't have BFFs.

09:15.801 --> 09:18.336
I'm just fixing his bike.

09:18.370 --> 09:19.437
Mm.

09:21.673 --> 09:23.374
What are you doing here?

09:23.408 --> 09:24.508
I thought you said

09:24.543 --> 09:25.676
you and Ethan broke up.

09:28.413 --> 09:30.414
I did, didn't I? Hmm.

09:30.449 --> 09:35.119
Well, he's just so
irresistible, I can't help it.

09:35.153 --> 09:37.088
You boys have fun.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.324
Sutton,

09:51.359 --> 09:53.426
you do know I live here, right?

09:53.461 --> 09:56.029
Sorry.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.231
You gonna call the cops?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.201
I used to swim here all the time
when my friend Char lived here.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.037
Besides...

10:04.071 --> 10:05.238
I wanted to see you.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.040
Well, I would be flattered

10:07.074 --> 10:09.075
if I didn't somehow think
this was about Ethan.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.944
Now, what's the deal with you guys anyways?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.113
We... did break up,

10:13.147 --> 10:14.914
I want him back,

10:14.949 --> 10:17.017
but he's playing hard to get.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.752
He's not playing that hard.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.721
I saw the way he was
looking at you at school.

10:21.756 --> 10:24.591
Right.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.693
School.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.461
How exactly was he looking at me?

10:28.496 --> 10:30.764
Like he wished you were
wearing something more like...

10:30.798 --> 10:32.599
that.

10:32.633 --> 10:37.270
Well, Ethan has some academic troubles.

10:37.304 --> 10:42.208
This paper, he doesn't want
me to know that he needs help,

10:42.243 --> 10:46.146
but if you could just
pass this along to him.

10:50.184 --> 10:52.085
Where'd you get this?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.887
Does it really matter?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.955
Look, I'm not up for this.

10:55.990 --> 10:58.892
If you want him to have the
paper, give it to him yourself.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.897
I'm going to have to
talk to Sutton's parents

11:03.931 --> 11:05.598
about all this trespassing.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.866
And you stay away from her.

11:06.901 --> 11:08.601
All right.

11:08.636 --> 11:10.437
What's that?

11:10.471 --> 11:11.638
I'm gonna throw you a party.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.440
Okay.

11:13.474 --> 11:15.475
Well, a little "Welcome to Scottsdale."

11:15.509 --> 11:16.443
Meet the kids.

11:16.477 --> 11:17.544
This is your guest list.

11:17.578 --> 11:20.246
Anything else?

11:20.281 --> 11:21.514
Yes, actually.

11:21.549 --> 11:24.451
I would like you to invite
Laurel Mercer to play the party.

11:24.485 --> 11:27.387
Her band is amazing and, uh, she's sweet.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.255
You need to know her.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.800
Oh, hey, Ted. Hi.

11:40.835 --> 11:41.935
This is perfect.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.703
Yeah.

11:43.738 --> 11:45.004
I was thinking the exact opposite.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.806
No, I was just going to call you.

11:46.841 --> 11:47.874
My stepson, Jordan,

11:47.908 --> 11:49.776
has just moved to town and I was gonna

11:49.810 --> 11:51.911
throw him what was supposed
to be a small party.

11:51.946 --> 11:55.582
But Jordan has turned
it into quite the rager.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.650
Do the kids even say that word anymore?

11:57.685 --> 11:59.619
And this affects me how?

11:59.653 --> 12:02.322
Well, Laurel is the
entertainment... the band.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.424
And I thought, kill two
birds with one stone.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.693
Ask you to chaperone and
you can see your daughter.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.395
You want me to come to your house?

12:09.430 --> 12:11.331
I know things got a
little haywire with Laurel

12:11.365 --> 12:13.099
at the Fairway Fest.

12:13.134 --> 12:15.135
And if I'm the reason, I'm sorry.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.336
If?

12:16.370 --> 12:19.038
Look, she'll be performing again.

12:19.073 --> 12:22.175
It's a chance for you to
see her finish her set.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.144
And I could really use the help.

12:27.248 --> 12:30.884
Theresa called.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.119
Dad wants to see me.

12:33.154 --> 12:35.088
Alone.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.057
Well, that's not a good idea.

12:38.092 --> 12:40.794
Look, I don't know why he
doesn't want to see you, too.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.928
'Cause I already went.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.798
I saw him, and it was not great.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.666
Me, too.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.535
I can't believe you guys didn't tell me.

12:48.569 --> 12:50.370
We were just trying to protect you,

12:50.404 --> 12:52.705
which is exactly what I'm
trying to do right now.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.208
He knows that Sutton and I are twins,

12:55.242 --> 12:56.609
and he told me I can't trust her.

12:56.644 --> 12:58.478
What?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.513
I think it has something
to do with our birth mother.

13:00.548 --> 13:04.017
Well, now I have to go, just to ask.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.019
- Thayer, maybe it'll be good...
- No.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.888
He's just gonna try and turn
us against each other, okay?

13:08.923 --> 13:10.056
We can't let that happen.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.257
Promise me that you won't go.

13:13.828 --> 13:14.994
Sorry, guys.

13:15.029 --> 13:16.095
Just give me a second.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.797
Hi.

13:17.832 --> 13:18.898
Hey, kiddo.

13:18.933 --> 13:20.967
- You look great.
- Thanks.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.869
Sweetie, I'm sorry about
what happened at Fairway Fest.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.737
I tried calling your mom, but she's...

13:24.772 --> 13:25.705
I know.

13:25.739 --> 13:26.840
She's really pissed.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.474
Yeah.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.844
Which is why I told her

13:30.878 --> 13:33.746
I think you guys should
go to couples counseling.

13:33.781 --> 13:35.448
Yeah, great.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.583
I'm in.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.284
Okay. Well, she needs convincing,

13:38.319 --> 13:40.553
and you have to be the
one to make that happen.

13:42.556 --> 13:45.124
Okay.

13:45.059 --> 13:48.161
Ethan.

13:51.065 --> 13:54.167
What are you doing?

13:54.201 --> 13:55.335
Saving your butt.

13:55.369 --> 13:58.037
Merry Christmas.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.942
Can't take that.

14:02.977 --> 14:04.878
Well, I'm not just gonna
sit and twiddle my thumbs

14:04.912 --> 14:06.813
while you flunk your way back into juvie.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.783
So...

14:09.817 --> 14:11.851
Why don't you just put
it in your back pocket,

14:11.886 --> 14:14.821
so it's there, whatever you decide.

14:28.602 --> 14:29.602
What is your problem?

14:29.637 --> 14:30.837
And what was that?

14:30.871 --> 14:32.772
If you must know, I gave him a paper.

14:32.807 --> 14:34.741
You're writing his papers now?

14:34.775 --> 14:37.243
I can guarantee you
that what I just gave him

14:37.278 --> 14:39.512
is going to be a lot better
than anything he can write.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.447
Well, he's not gonna use it.

14:41.482 --> 14:43.249
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:43.284 --> 14:45.151
- Not the Ethan I know.
- Well, I guess

14:45.186 --> 14:48.188
we'll just have to wait and see
which one of us knows him best.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.800
You're serious?

15:00.835 --> 15:01.935
Yeah.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.169
I've been tweeting about it,

15:03.204 --> 15:06.940
but so far I only have
253 followers from Arroyo.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.141
You've been here one day.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.142
I know, right?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.977
Should be a lot more.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.946
Okay, I'll bite.

15:15.616 --> 15:17.750
Nice.

15:17.785 --> 15:18.952
But strange-worthy?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.553
That's my band.

15:20.588 --> 15:21.921
We're playing your party?

15:21.956 --> 15:23.596
Figured this way would make it impossible

15:23.624 --> 15:25.425
for you to be able to say no.

15:25.459 --> 15:27.293
Okay.

15:27.328 --> 15:29.295
Let me check with Baz and the other guys.

15:29.330 --> 15:31.364
Baz... is that your boyfriend or something?

15:31.398 --> 15:34.500
No. He's not my boyfriend.

15:34.535 --> 15:36.336
Or anything.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.143
Turn them in, folks.

15:44.178 --> 15:46.112
Looking forward to reading your work.

16:04.698 --> 16:05.965
Hey.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.033
What are you doing?

16:07.067 --> 16:08.635
How can you cheat?

16:08.669 --> 16:10.703
You're better than that.

16:10.738 --> 16:12.572
Am I really?

16:12.606 --> 16:15.575
I'm such a stand-up guy,
why did you break up with me?

16:15.609 --> 16:17.977
It's totally different.

16:18.012 --> 16:20.580
You're just like Ted.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.482
Speaking of things that
are totally different.

16:22.516 --> 16:23.650
A cheater's a cheater.

16:23.684 --> 16:24.784
And a liar is what?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.619
A-okay?

16:26.654 --> 16:29.455
I'd get off your high horse
if I were you, "Sutton Mercer."

16:31.792 --> 16:34.627
I saw Sutton give you that paper.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.496
And you know what, screw it.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.299
Are you guys, like, back together or... ?

16:39.333 --> 16:43.169
Look, you and I broke up, remember?

16:43.203 --> 16:46.005
Which means you lost
the right to ask me that.

16:55.657 --> 16:57.024
Dad.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.695
What are you doing here?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.730
What's going on?

17:04.499 --> 17:05.566
Alec asked me to come help

17:05.599 --> 17:06.634
plead his case with his daughter.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.435
Mads, I know you're hurting.

17:08.470 --> 17:11.204
I'm sure you're angry, scared. Confused.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.374
And it's okay to feel all those things.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.175
You don't have to stop
feeling them to go see him.

17:15.210 --> 17:16.210
Just hear what he has to say.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.444
But even Sutton was there when

17:17.445 --> 17:19.287
Thayer said that my dad
was so horrible to him.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.250
Five minutes.

17:23.285 --> 17:24.218
Th-that's all he's asking.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.786
Five minutes.

17:25.820 --> 17:26.887
What do you think?

17:28.890 --> 17:30.791
I think you should go see him.

17:30.826 --> 17:32.093
Give him a chance.

17:34.062 --> 17:36.564
All right, then I will.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.599
Great. I'll tell him.

17:38.633 --> 17:39.734
I'll walk you out, Ted.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.609
Well, Thayer isn't gonna be very happy.

17:48.643 --> 17:51.278
Well, don't worry.

17:51.313 --> 17:55.382
I can handle my dad, and I
will get you your answers.

17:59.221 --> 18:01.188
Fine. I'll go with you to counseling.

18:01.223 --> 18:03.257
I mean, that's what this
is really about, right?

18:03.291 --> 18:07.094
Alec did call, but yes.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.929
I'm doing this for the girls.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.898
And you better make the
appointment right away

18:10.932 --> 18:12.032
before I change my mind.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.509
Hi.

18:21.543 --> 18:22.810
Look, now more than ever, you need to

18:22.844 --> 18:24.712
do as you're told and stay in the cabin.

18:24.746 --> 18:27.348
Okay.

18:27.382 --> 18:29.350
This will make it easier.

18:30.719 --> 18:32.453
A flat-screen TV?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.587
Wireless Internet?

18:33.622 --> 18:35.189
Yeah, I have a certain lifestyle

18:35.223 --> 18:36.357
that I've grown very accustomed to.

18:36.391 --> 18:37.458
And besides, how else am I

18:37.492 --> 18:39.132
supposed to lure Ethan back to the cabin?

18:39.161 --> 18:41.996
Look, that boy is distracting you,

18:42.030 --> 18:43.898
taking your focus off the plan.

18:43.932 --> 18:45.933
The only man needing seducing is Ted.

18:45.967 --> 18:47.234
Ew.

18:47.269 --> 18:49.837
I know, like, one big happy family, but ew.

18:49.871 --> 18:53.007
Sutton, this party is my chance

18:53.041 --> 18:54.942
to get just one step closer to Ted.

18:54.976 --> 18:55.910
How?

18:55.944 --> 18:57.545
Trust me, it is not easy

18:57.579 --> 18:59.513
getting a guy to fall in love with you.

18:59.548 --> 19:00.748
Ted is not just a guy, okay?

19:00.782 --> 19:02.550
What about my mom?

19:03.451 --> 19:05.419
I mean, Kristin.

19:05.453 --> 19:06.687
Have you thought of her?

19:06.721 --> 19:08.556
What do you think I've been thinking about

19:08.590 --> 19:09.757
for the last 17 years?

19:09.791 --> 19:12.326
I know what Ted and I had,

19:12.360 --> 19:14.628
and we can have it again.

19:14.663 --> 19:18.132
And trust me, Sutton, I
will not stop until we do.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.433
I ran the prints

19:19.467 --> 19:21.168
on Alec's golf bag, like you asked.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.236
And?

19:22.270 --> 19:24.171
I did find something on the bag.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.040
Anyone we know?

19:26.074 --> 19:27.408
Mostly prints that make sense.

19:27.442 --> 19:31.879
But there's one print here
that makes no sense at all.

19:33.915 --> 19:35.082
Jessica Whitman?

19:35.116 --> 19:37.051
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

19:37.085 --> 19:39.787
Until recently, a
waitress at Chelsea Creek.

19:39.821 --> 19:42.122
What's a sometime waitress
doing with Alec's golf bag?

19:42.157 --> 19:43.958
Let's go find out.

19:43.992 --> 19:46.660
You wanted to see me?

19:46.695 --> 19:48.696
Yeah. Have a seat.

19:55.737 --> 19:59.673
So, I know we've been
down this road before.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.609
Earlier this year, I accused you of

20:01.643 --> 20:04.545
turning in a paper that I
suspected wasn't your own work.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.248
But in the months that have
passed, I've come to learn

20:07.282 --> 20:10.284
that you are, in fact, quite
the gifted young writer.

20:10.318 --> 20:12.419
Thank you.

20:12.454 --> 20:14.421
Which is why I thought
that maybe it was you

20:14.456 --> 20:17.057
who wrote this paper for

20:17.092 --> 20:18.325
your boyfriend, Ethan here.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.995
Ethan's not my boyfriend.

20:21.029 --> 20:23.030
And I'm not a cheater.

20:23.064 --> 20:26.033
Good. Then I can count on
you to tell me the truth.

20:26.067 --> 20:28.068
I saw you talking after class.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.737
Maybe you know something.

20:29.771 --> 20:30.938
Maybe you can say whether or not

20:30.972 --> 20:32.773
you think that this paper represents

20:32.807 --> 20:35.743
Ethan's own work?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.811
What you think?

20:43.618 --> 20:46.353
Ethan's been working really hard,

20:46.388 --> 20:48.389
trying to turn things around.

20:48.423 --> 20:52.626
And he's not the type of
person who would cheat.

20:52.661 --> 20:57.331
So that paper must be his.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.501
All right.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.210
Hey. Hey.

21:12.213 --> 21:14.348
Thanks.

21:29.545 --> 21:31.346
A flat-screen TV?

21:31.380 --> 21:33.147
What is all this?

21:33.182 --> 21:36.217
I got bored, so I ordered
some stuff off the Internet.

21:36.252 --> 21:38.987
Did you get that paper
on the Internet, too?

21:39.021 --> 21:41.823
Okay, look, I know you and
Ethan aren't dating anymore,

21:41.857 --> 21:43.825
but I at least thought
that you cared about him.

21:43.859 --> 21:46.060
- As a friend.
- Of course I do.

21:46.095 --> 21:48.663
Then I guess he didn't tell
you the trouble that he's in.

21:49.798 --> 21:52.066
What... what do you mean?

21:52.101 --> 21:54.769
Well...

21:54.803 --> 21:56.804
after all the help he gave us,

21:56.839 --> 21:58.906
he kind of fell behind.

21:58.941 --> 22:01.609
And you didn't think
he can do it on his own?

22:01.644 --> 22:02.777
I wanted to help him.

22:02.811 --> 22:04.679
Just like you're always doing.

22:16.225 --> 22:18.393
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:18.427 --> 22:22.430
I already know what you're gonna say, so...

22:22.464 --> 22:24.132
Why?

22:24.166 --> 22:27.035
Because you talked to Thayer and... Emma?

22:29.238 --> 22:32.907
If you knew about the twins,
why didn't you say anything?

22:32.941 --> 22:35.843
Because I'm protecting them.

22:35.878 --> 22:37.845
Because there's a killer still out there,

22:37.880 --> 22:39.981
who doesn't want the
secret of the twins known.

22:40.015 --> 22:41.849
It's the same person that killed Derek,

22:41.884 --> 22:43.618
that put me in here...

22:43.652 --> 22:46.554
Dad, I saw the picture

22:46.588 --> 22:49.657
of you holding the murder
weapon over Derek's head.

22:49.692 --> 22:51.559
Then why didn't you say anything?

22:51.593 --> 22:53.461
Why didn't you come to me?

22:53.495 --> 22:55.296
Why'd you let me go
through the whole wedding

22:55.331 --> 22:58.232
as if nothing had happened,
as if everything was okay?

22:58.267 --> 23:01.235
Well, I'm coming to you now.

23:01.270 --> 23:05.039
And I need to know, once and for all:

23:05.074 --> 23:06.240
Did you kill Derek?

23:06.275 --> 23:08.109
No.

23:08.143 --> 23:11.346
Look, honey, the night he
was murdered, he called me.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.848
He wanted me to come down
and talk to him at the garage.

23:13.882 --> 23:15.216
I shouldn't have gone
down there, but I did.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.752
When I got there, he
started going on and on about

23:17.786 --> 23:20.788
a woman in a car, in a lake...

23:20.823 --> 23:22.957
it didn't make any sense to me.

23:22.991 --> 23:24.826
He came at me in a panic,

23:24.860 --> 23:27.628
and I picked up a tire iron...

23:27.663 --> 23:29.564
I told him to back off and calm down.

23:29.598 --> 23:30.865
He did, and I left.

23:30.899 --> 23:33.401
The next thing I heard, he was dead.

23:33.435 --> 23:35.536
Honey, somebody came down

23:35.571 --> 23:37.505
to that garage after I left.

23:37.539 --> 23:39.607
So you're saying that...

23:39.641 --> 23:42.543
Teresa found a fingerprint
that proves I'm being framed.

23:42.578 --> 23:46.180
Maddie, I swear, on my life...

23:46.215 --> 23:49.250
on your life...

23:49.284 --> 23:53.287
on everything that means anything to me...

23:53.322 --> 23:55.156
I'm innocent.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.867
Dad, I'm so sorry.

24:05.901 --> 24:07.034
- About what?
- I've been doing,

24:07.069 --> 24:09.937
like, stupid stuff,

24:09.972 --> 24:11.839
and going crazy, and... I never believed

24:11.874 --> 24:12.974
that you could kill anyone,

24:13.008 --> 24:15.610
and I tried, and I tried
to tell Thayer that.

24:15.644 --> 24:16.844
Don't worry about Thayer.

24:16.879 --> 24:18.780
Whatever's going on between he and I

24:18.814 --> 24:20.815
has been going on for a long
time, and I can handle it.

24:20.849 --> 24:22.717
Okay?

24:23.852 --> 24:25.453
Madeline, I love you.

24:26.588 --> 24:28.489
I love you, too.

24:28.524 --> 24:31.325
Hey, hey.

24:43.338 --> 24:45.373
Whoa! Wow.

24:45.407 --> 24:49.110
When you throw a party,
you don't mess around.

24:49.144 --> 24:50.978
Laurel!

24:51.013 --> 24:52.246
It's so good to see you,

24:52.281 --> 24:54.315
and to see that you've
continued with your music.

24:55.951 --> 24:59.086
Even though everything with your...

24:59.121 --> 25:01.022
How are your parents doing?

25:01.056 --> 25:05.026
That's kind of number
272 on the list of things

25:05.060 --> 25:06.861
I'm never going to talk to you about.

25:09.965 --> 25:11.899
Yes, you have every right to be angry,

25:11.934 --> 25:13.868
and yes, I was stupid all those years ago.

25:13.902 --> 25:15.636
That is not what this is about.

25:15.671 --> 25:16.971
- And stupid now, to keep lying about it.
- Thank you!

25:17.005 --> 25:18.840
I love you more than life.

25:18.874 --> 25:20.608
I thought I was doing the right thing.

25:20.642 --> 25:23.377
- By what?
- Protecting you.

25:23.412 --> 25:24.579
You weren't protecting me.

25:24.613 --> 25:26.454
You were lying to my
face, over and over again.

25:26.482 --> 25:27.782
I don't... I don't know who you are.

25:27.816 --> 25:29.576
- You are not the man that I married.
- Please...

25:29.585 --> 25:31.486
there's got to be something I can do,

25:31.520 --> 25:33.187
anything to make this right. Anything.

25:33.222 --> 25:34.555
Just tell me, what will it take?

25:34.590 --> 25:36.424
That's a fair question, Kristin.

25:36.458 --> 25:38.125
What do you think it would take

25:38.160 --> 25:39.600
for you to be able to get past this?

25:42.998 --> 25:45.199
I mean, if you were to promise me right now

25:45.234 --> 25:47.235
that you have told me everything,

25:47.269 --> 25:48.903
there are no more secrets,

25:48.937 --> 25:50.238
it is finally all out in the open...

25:50.272 --> 25:54.709
maybe, maybe I could look
for a way to understand and...

25:54.743 --> 25:56.010
and start again.

26:01.049 --> 26:02.817
Yes.

26:02.851 --> 26:04.986
I swear you know everything.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.622
Oh, calm down.

26:07.656 --> 26:09.757
Every white, upper-middle-class,
middle-aged couple

26:09.791 --> 26:11.692
that hits a bump goes to therapy.

26:11.727 --> 26:12.827
It doesn't mean it's gonna work.

26:12.861 --> 26:14.695
What makes you so sure?

26:14.730 --> 26:16.764
Kristin's not going to
forgive him so easily.

26:16.798 --> 26:18.566
But the real question is:

26:18.600 --> 26:21.435
What to wear?

26:21.470 --> 26:25.373
Red lace or cobalt blue?

26:25.407 --> 26:27.508
Once again, ew.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.414
Hey, you're here early.

26:35.250 --> 26:40.054
And you're... looking
a little Courtney Love.

26:40.088 --> 26:43.057
Yeah, well, I had a fairly crap day.

26:43.091 --> 26:46.127
Um, and I heard Jordan
was throwing a party, so...

26:46.161 --> 26:48.930
I guess you guys are,
like, family now, right?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.134
Yeah.

26:53.168 --> 26:54.936
Right.

26:57.005 --> 26:58.906
What to get for the guy who has everything.

26:58.941 --> 27:00.775
Which way to the punch?

27:00.809 --> 27:02.076
Hey, I heard about that paper, man.

27:02.110 --> 27:04.150
- Heard Beastly really got on your ass about it.
- Yeah.

27:04.179 --> 27:06.814
I'm sure Sutton's just trying to help.

27:06.848 --> 27:08.749
You know she's the one who gave it to me?

27:08.784 --> 27:11.052
Girl may deny it, but
she's really into you.

27:11.086 --> 27:14.722
And from what I saw,
smoking hot in a bikini, too.

27:15.824 --> 27:17.725
Yeah.

27:17.759 --> 27:20.461
You really think this woman's framing Alec?

27:20.495 --> 27:21.696
Or knows who is.

27:21.730 --> 27:24.365
My ass is killing me.

27:24.399 --> 27:28.235
I'm telling you, getting out
of these all-night stakeouts,

27:28.270 --> 27:30.504
- it's... it's reason enough to go to law school.
- Come on.

27:30.539 --> 27:32.473
The caffeine-sugar fix is your specialty.

27:32.507 --> 27:35.409
I know it got me through plenty
of all-nighters at the academy.

27:35.444 --> 27:37.278
That's not the only thing we did all night.

27:41.950 --> 27:44.118
Showtime.

27:49.157 --> 27:51.826
Let's go.

27:55.897 --> 27:57.865
Jessica Whitman?

27:57.899 --> 27:59.066
Scottsdale PD.

27:59.101 --> 28:02.069
We have a few questions to ask you.

28:13.682 --> 28:15.449
No...

28:18.487 --> 28:21.355
He said you'd never find me.

28:21.390 --> 28:22.590
Who said that?

29:01.908 --> 29:04.710
Look, I know the dude's
my stepbrother, but...

29:04.744 --> 29:06.512
he's also a major buzz killer, right?

29:06.546 --> 29:10.382
So if you hate him, I hate him, too.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.461
Mads. Hey.

29:22.495 --> 29:24.296
How'd it go with your dad?

29:24.330 --> 29:26.198
- You okay?
- Yeah, just...

29:26.232 --> 29:27.533
Leave me alone, I don't
want to talk about it.

29:27.567 --> 29:29.167
I just want to know what he said.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.236
I'm trying to dance, here. Okay?

29:31.271 --> 29:33.238
Mads, come on. This is us.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.973
Exactly.

29:35.008 --> 29:37.175
The hell's that supposed to mean?

29:37.210 --> 29:39.311
It means I never should
have listened to you.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.313
I knew dad was innocent,

29:41.347 --> 29:43.849
and I tried to tell you a million times,

29:43.883 --> 29:45.122
- and you never listened to me.
- He's not innocent.

29:45.123 --> 29:47.052
There's evidence. The photo?

29:47.086 --> 29:49.154
- Did you ask him about that?
- Yes.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.956
And there's an explanation.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.157
And now there's some new fingerprint.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.126
What about knowing that we're twins?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.994
My dad might be the one
person protecting you.

29:56.029 --> 29:57.829
- Did you ever think about that?
- Oh, my God.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.064
Is that what he said? And you believed him?

29:59.098 --> 30:00.899
Would you stop doing that?

30:00.934 --> 30:02.601
You're spinning around this whole story,

30:02.635 --> 30:03.735
twisting everything like you always do,

30:03.770 --> 30:05.938
and you pushed me, and you pushed Emma...

30:05.972 --> 30:07.706
No, that's not true. I
convinced Thayer that...

30:07.740 --> 30:09.608
Maybe that's what you
think, and maybe that's

30:09.642 --> 30:10.882
what Thayer wants you to think.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.579
But the trouble with him and
my dad goes back way before

30:13.613 --> 30:15.647
- you ever got to town.
- I'm not the only one who's had issues with him, okay?

30:15.682 --> 30:17.549
That's why I left L.A.
and came back to help you.

30:17.584 --> 30:19.685
- It's different, and you know it.
- And why is that?

30:19.719 --> 30:22.521
Because he's not your real father.

30:22.555 --> 30:25.657
Hey. Hey. You all right?

30:25.692 --> 30:28.293
No, I just need to get
away from these people.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.130
- Thayer...
- I need some air.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.307
I got a phone call.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.909
From who?

30:43.943 --> 30:46.078
I don't know. A man.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.214
He said all I had to do was get a tire iron

30:49.248 --> 30:51.116
out of the garbage can by the third hole

30:51.150 --> 30:52.918
and drop it into Mr. Rybak's bag.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.920
And you said yes?

30:54.954 --> 30:57.055
I mean, I know he's the district attorney.

30:57.090 --> 30:59.024
I... thought I was
helping him solve a case.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.926
And I'm sure the money didn't hurt.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.561
Ten grand?

31:03.696 --> 31:05.897
That just turned up in my locker.

31:05.932 --> 31:07.532
It...

31:07.567 --> 31:08.767
then I saw the news,

31:08.801 --> 31:11.436
and I saw Mr. Rybak get arrested...

31:11.471 --> 31:13.372
I knew I couldn't come forward, so I...

31:13.406 --> 31:14.640
All right, all right.

31:16.509 --> 31:19.244
You have any idea who this
man was that called you?

31:20.380 --> 31:21.580
No.

31:21.614 --> 31:24.349
- And you're sure it was a man?
- Yeah.

31:24.384 --> 31:26.251
Absolutely.

31:37.030 --> 31:39.097
You okay?

31:39.132 --> 31:41.900
Honestly, I don't know.

31:44.771 --> 31:46.738
Stop.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.811
What happened the other night was

31:52.845 --> 31:54.713
a huge mistake.

31:54.747 --> 31:58.216
I'm humiliated, 'cause believe it or not,

31:58.251 --> 32:01.353
I'm not in the habit of...

32:01.387 --> 32:04.089
Believe it or not, neither am I.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.224
Oh.

32:08.461 --> 32:11.296
Um...

32:11.330 --> 32:13.298
we need to let this go.

32:13.332 --> 32:16.868
And, like, never mention it again.

32:19.072 --> 32:20.172
Whatever you want.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.940
I just hope that, um,

32:21.974 --> 32:24.509
you know, we can still be friends.

32:24.544 --> 32:27.479
Friends, yeah, absolutely.

32:30.883 --> 32:32.718
Thanks for the coffee.

32:32.752 --> 32:34.453
Sure.

32:34.487 --> 32:36.621
I wasn't sure how the
counseling would turn out,

32:36.656 --> 32:38.590
but it was actually okay.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.459
Yeah, it was.

32:40.493 --> 32:42.394
I'm parked around the corner,

32:42.428 --> 32:44.362
so I'll see you.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.497
Well, let me walk you.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.632
No, thanks, Ted.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.202
But I'm really glad

32:50.236 --> 32:52.137
we can finally be honest with each other.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.072
Absolutely. Me, too.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.242
Night.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.510
Good night.

You don't know what you're talking about.

33:57.170 --> 33:59.104
Well, you know, he stormed off

33:59.138 --> 34:01.907
and left you alone over there.

34:01.941 --> 34:04.075
Kind of smelled like a lovers' spat to me.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.011
Well, it wasn't, okay?

34:06.045 --> 34:07.245
It wasn't anything like that.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.147
Hey, hey.

34:09.181 --> 34:12.083
You think he's so much
better than me, don't you?

34:12.118 --> 34:13.918
Ethan, look,

34:13.953 --> 34:16.655
Sutton told me about juvie,

34:16.688 --> 34:18.956
and I am so sorry that
you're in trouble, but...

34:18.991 --> 34:20.659
Then that's it.

34:20.693 --> 34:21.893
You're just gonna rely on Thayer now.

34:21.928 --> 34:23.594
He's here. He's the one that's

34:23.629 --> 34:24.795
gonna solve the mystery for you, right?

34:24.831 --> 34:26.697
You have no right!

34:26.732 --> 34:28.567
Especially after what you did.

34:28.601 --> 34:31.369
Thayer has always been there
for me. And I trust him,

34:31.404 --> 34:34.239
which is a hell of a lot
more than I can say about you.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.639
Yeah. Right.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.178
When I think about it,

34:40.213 --> 34:44.014
you and Sutton are perfect for each other.

34:44.050 --> 34:46.184
She wanted my permission.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.053
You got it.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.353
Have fun.

34:49.388 --> 34:52.224
So, what, are you just gonna
go lose it to Thayer now?

34:58.097 --> 35:00.198
You and I broke up, remember?

35:00.233 --> 35:02.901
Which means you lost
the right to ask me that.

We want to thank Jordan
for having us out tonight.

35:18.135 --> 35:19.935
Welcome to Scottsdale Jordan.
Have a great night everyone.

35:27.844 --> 35:29.512
Hey.

35:33.617 --> 35:35.618
Is it true what Mads said?

35:35.652 --> 35:39.288
Is Alec really not your father?

35:39.322 --> 35:41.490
Well, I guess it depends on how you define

35:41.525 --> 35:43.392
what makes someone your father.

35:43.426 --> 35:45.528
Everyone knows, huh?

35:49.299 --> 35:52.001
My mom left my biological father, Graham,

35:52.035 --> 35:53.135
when I was just a baby.

35:53.170 --> 35:55.104
And then she married Alec,

35:55.138 --> 35:58.174
so Alec was the only father I ever knew.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.975
Till Graham came back when I was 12

36:00.010 --> 36:01.944
and convinced my mom to run away with him.

36:03.013 --> 36:04.046
Wow.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.881
They gave me a choice:

36:05.916 --> 36:07.716
I could either stay with Alec and Mads

36:07.751 --> 36:11.020
or go off with mom and...

36:11.054 --> 36:12.655
"Bio dad."

36:12.689 --> 36:15.724
And you chose Alec.

36:17.661 --> 36:20.529
And I've always suspected
that there's a part of him

36:20.564 --> 36:23.332
that wishes I had left,

36:23.366 --> 36:26.302
a part of him that hates
me for reminding him

36:26.336 --> 36:30.206
of the one thing that he ever lost...

36:30.240 --> 36:31.507
his wife.

36:36.379 --> 36:39.148
Don't.

36:39.182 --> 36:42.017
I don't need you feeling sorry for me.

36:42.052 --> 36:43.219
Trust me.

36:43.253 --> 36:46.088
That's not how I feel.

36:57.801 --> 36:59.702
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:59.736 --> 37:01.003
Thanks for playing. You sounded great.

37:01.037 --> 37:02.871
Well, yeah, the band's
really coming together.

37:02.906 --> 37:04.506
Oh, screw them.

37:04.541 --> 37:05.708
You're the one with the real talent.

37:05.742 --> 37:06.909
You should really think about going solo.

37:06.943 --> 37:09.645
Okay, whatever.

37:09.679 --> 37:12.648
"These days, it seems like
everyone's bidding on love."

37:12.682 --> 37:14.283
You wrote that, didn't you?

37:14.317 --> 37:15.618
How did you know?

37:15.652 --> 37:19.255
'Cause I saw your eyes when you sang it.

37:19.289 --> 37:21.123
Like it came from someplace real,

37:21.157 --> 37:23.358
someplace didn't know if you
wanted other people to see.

37:25.095 --> 37:26.495
Hey, man. It was a great party.

37:26.529 --> 37:28.464
Whoa. No, no.

37:28.498 --> 37:30.065
Gotta go.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.233
You are not driving home.

37:31.268 --> 37:33.369
I'll drive ya.

37:33.403 --> 37:35.271
Hey, it was really good work on the fiddle.

37:35.305 --> 37:36.272
I enjoyed that.

37:36.306 --> 37:37.873
Mm, thanks.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.141
- You should, though.
- Hmm?

37:39.175 --> 37:40.976
You should let people see.

37:41.011 --> 37:43.045
It looked really good on you.

37:49.185 --> 37:51.920
So who do you think he is?

37:51.955 --> 37:53.789
The mystery man who made the call,

37:53.823 --> 37:54.923
trying to frame Alec?

37:54.958 --> 37:56.725
Doesn't matter.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.828
I have enough to go to the
judge and get Alec released.

37:59.863 --> 38:02.765
Unless... Alec was the one who set it up.

38:02.799 --> 38:04.667
Unless he's the man.

38:04.701 --> 38:06.602
What are you talking about?

38:06.636 --> 38:09.338
It was his idea to run
the prints, wasn't it?

38:09.372 --> 38:11.240
Maybe he wanted you to find something,

38:11.274 --> 38:12.374
maybe he knew you would.

38:12.409 --> 38:14.276
And frame himself for murder?

38:14.311 --> 38:15.511
Why would he do that?

38:15.545 --> 38:18.480
To throw us off, play the victim,

38:18.515 --> 38:20.282
find someone else to blame,

38:20.317 --> 38:22.318
even though he's the one who's guilty.

38:22.352 --> 38:24.920
That's crazy.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.356
But clever, just like Alec.

38:32.896 --> 38:34.129
Hey, you're awake.

38:37.133 --> 38:39.068
Can I pull up a fork? I'm starving.

38:39.102 --> 38:40.969
And clearly in a good mood.

38:41.004 --> 38:43.038
Tonight was kind of amaze-balls.

38:43.073 --> 38:46.942
And I'm hoping it was
amaze-balls for you, too.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.777
I don't even know what that is,

38:48.812 --> 38:50.913
and I don't want you to get your hopes up,

38:50.947 --> 38:52.481
but it went well.

38:53.717 --> 38:56.719
It was... better than I expected.

38:56.753 --> 38:58.354
Yeah?

38:58.388 --> 38:59.588
We're both still alive.

38:59.622 --> 39:02.324
Amaze-balls.

39:04.694 --> 39:07.196
So, you missed the whole thing.

39:07.230 --> 39:10.165
I'm sure there was a good reason.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.433
I don't mean to pry,

39:11.468 --> 39:14.470
but something to do with Kristin?

39:14.504 --> 39:15.471
Hey, Rebecca.

39:15.505 --> 39:17.172
Look, I...

39:17.207 --> 39:20.075
was there for you the last time you went

39:20.110 --> 39:22.077
through a rough patch with your wife.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.379
Back off.

39:23.413 --> 39:26.014
Oh, please, that's not what I meant.

39:26.049 --> 39:28.050
I mean, I'm married to your best friend.

39:28.084 --> 39:29.952
There's no risk of anything happening.

39:29.986 --> 39:32.955
'Cause marriage was always sacred to you.

39:32.989 --> 39:35.858
Look, I want you to work
things out with Kristin.

39:35.892 --> 39:37.960
And I'd like to be there for you.

39:37.994 --> 39:39.161
To help.

39:44.834 --> 39:46.969
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:47.003 --> 39:49.738
What'd Thayer tell you?

39:49.773 --> 39:51.607
The whole story.

39:51.641 --> 39:53.709
Which, frankly, is really sad.

39:56.579 --> 39:58.714
I can't believe that I just...

39:58.748 --> 40:02.718
God, I am such a bitch for
throwing that in his face.

40:02.752 --> 40:04.720
Mads...

40:04.754 --> 40:07.589
No, I'm a total mess right now.

40:08.825 --> 40:10.492
I mean, it's okay.

40:10.527 --> 40:12.761
You've been drinking a lot, but...

40:12.796 --> 40:16.698
That's not all of it.

40:16.733 --> 40:18.634
I hooked up with Jordan.

40:19.736 --> 40:21.403
Tonight?

40:21.438 --> 40:23.539
No, at Fairway Fest.

40:23.573 --> 40:26.375
In the pool before I even knew his name.

40:26.409 --> 40:28.544
I had totally random,
anonymous sex with the guy,

40:28.578 --> 40:31.346
and now it turns out,
he's my new stepbrother.

40:31.381 --> 40:33.382
Hey!

40:34.551 --> 40:36.251
Are you guys crying?

40:36.286 --> 40:37.352
No.

40:37.387 --> 40:39.288
Good, 'cause I don't want

40:39.322 --> 40:42.391
anyone to be upset, 'cause
tonight was all-around amazing!

40:42.425 --> 40:44.092
Because of mom?

40:44.127 --> 40:45.194
She was so happy.

40:45.228 --> 40:48.397
I know.

40:48.431 --> 40:51.500
Plus, Jordan Lyle...

40:51.534 --> 40:53.268
I think he likes me.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.446
Let me know if you want to pull over.

41:04.481 --> 41:06.982
I don't want you boot in my mom's car.

41:07.016 --> 41:09.218
Don't worry about me, pretty boy, okay?

41:09.252 --> 41:12.020
Look, Thayer's not even
in high school anymore.

41:12.055 --> 41:15.958
You know, him coming to that
party with Sutton is... lame.

41:15.992 --> 41:19.995
You know what? Take a right up here.

41:20.029 --> 41:21.296
Where we going?

41:30.006 --> 41:31.173
Thanks for the ride.

41:31.207 --> 41:32.975
You sure you're all right here?

41:33.009 --> 41:35.377
I'll see you, man.

41:35.411 --> 41:37.346
All right. Take it easy.

42:17.253 --> 42:19.187
What took you so long?
