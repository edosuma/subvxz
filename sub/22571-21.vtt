WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.304
- Oh, we got competition
coming in with a trailer.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.106
San Jacinto?

00:05.139 --> 00:07.441
- Well, I'm guessing.
I can't read, you know that.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.043
Dropped out of school
when I was in the third grade.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.944
- You did not.
- Started buying auctions.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.946
- You did not.
- Sounds good, though.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.182
Like a good famous story.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.983
Dropped out
when I was only six years old,

00:16.016 --> 00:18.219
started buying units
in my stroller,

00:18.252 --> 00:19.487
and look where I am today.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.255
- All the way
to socks and sandals.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.895
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:27.928 --> 00:30.264
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:30.298 --> 00:31.765
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:31.799 --> 00:33.767
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.103
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.437
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:36.470 --> 00:38.139
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:38.172 --> 00:39.673
- You shut your face.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.842
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.010
- We're back, baby!

00:46.347 --> 00:48.649
- Today I'm headed
to Rancho Cucamonga.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.252
You can tell by
the excitement in my face

00:51.285 --> 00:53.053
that I'm excited
to be going there.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.955
It's been so long
since I've been there.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.657
I don't even remember
what I bought last time.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.359
- When you've been to as many
facilities as me,

00:58.392 --> 00:59.827
they just become a blur.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.995
I may have never been
to Rancho Cucamonga.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.332
But my goal today is,
if there's anything good,

01:04.365 --> 01:06.167
I'm bringing it home.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.935
- Kenny got him
a game plan today.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.803
It's all about
the small lockers.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.673
Because the big lockers seem to
get me in a little trouble.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.908
Find somebody
to help me move it out.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.310
And they don't really
want to work.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.546
The  get broken,
excuse my language.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.013
Watch your profanity!

01:20.047 --> 01:25.052
I usually like everything big:
buffets, burgers, booties.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.321
But today,
the smaller the better.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.191
I'll get a nice small locker,
you know what I mean?

01:30.224 --> 01:32.593
Small units it is, America.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.528
In "Ranchos Cucas-mongas."

01:36.630 --> 01:37.865
- Hey, man.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.601
- My friend, Chuck.
He's my mentor.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.770
- Nice to meet you, Chuck.
- Yeah, I was his teacher.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.538
- Hey, can you like
whisper, and say,

01:44.572 --> 01:45.773
"Yo, let Kenny slide
with this one."

01:45.806 --> 01:47.441
- Yeah, we'll--
we'll talk to him.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.442
- Yeah, whisper in his ear.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.643
- Oh, yeah.
- Kumbaya.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.911
- Yeah, you know,
these young guys,

01:50.944 --> 01:53.447
they want us old guys
to teach them everything.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.518
- Whoo.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.621
I'm looking for tools today,
because my people want tools.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.525
Heck, I want tools.
Pray to God they got tools.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.859
- I feel like today's the day.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.861
Let's knock it out.
Let's buy some stuff.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.397
I just don't know what our
approach is going to be.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.065
- I feel like strategies are
just not working for us, Jay.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.202
I feel like we should just--

02:14.235 --> 02:15.603
- I think we should
just wing it.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.272
- Oh, man, that's my favorite

02:18.306 --> 02:20.541
That's where I shine.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.377
- Yup, I'm letting my bitch
off the leash.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.383
does that mean?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.252
- Hey, it's Brandi,
showing up for work.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.753
I know you ain't
trying to buy nothing.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.622
Get them white shoes all dirty.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.624
How you gonna work
in white shoes?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.526
- Look at those
nice white shoes, Ivy.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.127
I'll give you 100 bucks
if you step on her shoes.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.362
- Don't even consider it,

02:41.395 --> 02:42.563
you'll get a white shoe
right up your ass.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.097
- You can't kick that high.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.567
- Thank you so much for coming
out today to Rancho Cucamonga.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.136
My name is Emily; I'm going
to be your auctioneer today.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
There are a couple rules.
Once I open the door,

02:51.205 --> 02:53.841
you can't go in, and you can't
touch anything inside the unit.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.108
It's a cash-only auction,

02:55.142 --> 02:57.177
and if you guys are ready
to see them, so am I.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.178
Let's go.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.215
- Back it up one time.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.752
- Follow the lady in green.
I'm wearing the color of money.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.191
- That's a good one there, but
that's kind of expensive.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.893
.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.497
- Oh, I like that
electric stove.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.932
Ooh, vintage mixer in there.
I can see it from here.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.100
We've got quantity.
I might be in.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.201
I'm probably in.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.036
- I know we have
no strategy today.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.171
We're flying
by the seat of our pants.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.173
- Mm-hmm.
- But by first look,

03:26.206 --> 03:28.709
I think it looks pretty good,
so when we go up there,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.010
let's point out
a couple of good things,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.211
but don't
build it up too much.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.580
- Okay.
- All right.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.081
- I don't love this unit,
but I like it a little bit.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.850
I see a few tools down there,
electric stove right there,

03:36.884 --> 03:39.219
200 bucks, a refrigerator
right there, 400 bucks.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.621
I'm in at least 600 bucks,

03:40.654 --> 03:42.490
I see that much
material up front.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.658
Why wait today
when you can bid now?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.294
- Old, white refrigerator.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.595
- I see a safe.
- Rusty tools.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.129
- Couple of file cabinets.
- I see a safe, too.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.332
- There's nothing safe
about this unit.

03:51.365 --> 03:55.002
- I see a safe in this mother--

03:55.035 --> 03:56.504
You know what that mean.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.508
Fudge.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.210
Oh, okay.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.347
We got
Kent Clark himself, bro.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.017
Yo, Superman, come back and
let me know else is in here.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.220
Yeah, bruh, that's a good
observation from here, man.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.955
- All righty, guys, here we go.
First unit of the day,

04:14.988 --> 04:16.324
and it's a nice one.
Look at all those boxes,

04:16.357 --> 04:17.925
nice and neatly stacked.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.527
And, what do you
say there, 500.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.795
- Five!

04:21.829 --> 04:23.063
7, 600. I'm looking at 8.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.732
7 and 8, I'm looking
at 7 and 8, 900.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.634
The bid at 900, 9, 10, now 11.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.036
Now at 1100, I'm at 12,
I'm at 12 and 13.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.805
Looking at 12 and 13, and 12
and 1300, I've got 12 and 13.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.743
I'm looking at 13, 13, 1400 and
14, now 15, now 1600, now 1700.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.445
- Too much money, Ivy,
don't bid no more.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.347
- Aight.
- And 17 and 1800,

04:39.380 --> 04:41.715
I'm looking at a bid of 17,
and 18, now 1900.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.817
- No plan, no structure.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.786
- Good job.
- Winging it.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.955
- Sold it to you for 1800.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.623
- I think 1800
is a bit too much,

04:49.657 --> 04:51.792
but hey,
today we're winging it.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.928
- This may be the best unit
we bought in a while.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.503
- Whoo! Damn.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.474
- Patio set,
couple of speakers,

05:06.507 --> 05:09.810
Now I know why I can't remember
ever coming to Rancho Cucamonga

05:09.843 --> 05:11.512
and getting a good room.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.913
- We got Jesus in here.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.282
They got a cage, I don't know
what they had in it.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.351
Probably some animals
or something.

05:17.385 --> 05:20.554
It's not the smallest locker,
but it's small enough.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.322
So I'm going for it.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.292
- Got a nice patio table here,
bedroom set on the right.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.727
Not enough tools.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.961
- They tagged
the whole dresser.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.430
- Yeah, that's
how you know it's classy.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.898
- That's, well, it's so it
matches the rest of the stuff.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.132
- Mm-hmm.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.667
- All righty, guys,
we've got a 10x10

05:33.701 --> 05:35.369
with furniture,
sound equipment.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.904
What do you say there,
I don't have 1, 100,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.373
Bid 50, bid 50, going to 25.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.874
- Zero!
- I'm looking at 25, 10.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.776
Have I even got 10?
I've got 10, and 15, 10 and 15,

05:42.810 --> 05:44.845
- 10 to 15, I'm looking at 25.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.548
25, , 30.
At 25, have I got a bid of 30?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.150
- 40.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.019
At 40, ,
can I get 5, can I get 5, 45.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.320
Now I'm at 50,
I'm looking at 55,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.722
50, making it 50,
looking at 55 now,

05:56.323 --> 05:58.492
Now 55 and 60,
and 55, have I got 60?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.927
I've got 55, final bid at 55,

05:59.960 --> 06:02.496
- I'm still at zero.
- I've got 55, and now 60.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.997
Sold it to you, 55, Kenny.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.567
Kenny done did it
for $55.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.436
- Baller!

06:08.469 --> 06:10.237
- You know those mornings
where you wake up

06:10.270 --> 06:11.772
and regret
what you did yesterday?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.340
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's going to be one of them.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.148
- Let's see what kinds of
treasures I got in here.

06:21.181 --> 06:24.652
One table, four chairs,
$10 a chair.

06:24.685 --> 06:28.388
$10, the table,
we got 50 bucks right here.

06:28.422 --> 06:32.325
Look at this ,
some kind of net.

06:32.359 --> 06:36.196
Take this to the fishing pond
and catch something.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.865
Gotcha, $5.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.468
We got a ragged-ass rollaway.

06:40.501 --> 06:44.838
Look like somebody had the gas
real bad and blew it up.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.839
No money.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.140
"The Last Supper."

06:47.174 --> 06:50.277
God go for $5
right there, sorry, Jesus.

06:50.310 --> 06:53.380
Looky here.
Where all my real cooks at?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.248
This a mixer,
you can mix up all of them,

06:55.282 --> 06:57.084
that dough
to make them biscuits.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.520
Look at that, Cooks.
Cooks!

06:59.553 --> 07:01.589
I'd say this here
is a good about $10.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.491
Okay, let's go in the cage.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.294
They got gasoline in here.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.428
If you ran out of gas,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.531
then, well, you could get
it right here.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.834
No money.

07:13.867 --> 07:18.639
Well, this is a new game board.
It's called dart in the cage.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.073
If you can
get it through there.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.376
That ain't no money, no way.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.949
Jordan.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.484
No money.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.253
1959 ass DJ kit.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.691
It's made by Sony.
Equalizer, radio, cassette.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.493
If you can get surround
sound out of this, boy,

07:39.527 --> 07:42.262
I pay for your shipping out
of this one. $10.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.231
Futon, no money.

07:44.264 --> 07:49.236
And the rest of this stuff
is straight up junky, nothing.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.806
Nothing, ain't nothing
in these drawers right here.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.343
Kenny didn't do it this time.
But Kenny will do it next time.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.911
Let me get myself
back to the auction,

07:57.945 --> 08:01.314
maybe I could find me
a better unit or something.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.785
- Here we go, guys.
Let's see what we've got today.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.856
- Old computers.
Oh man, this is a tough one.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.423
- Skateboard.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.192
- You're going to ride it out
of here when we're feeling bad.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.493
Is that a guitar back there?

08:13.527 --> 08:16.163
It's like a kid's guitar,
it's not even real.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.431
- I don't know.
- Let me see, Chuck.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.633
You've got $50 worth of stuff,

08:19.667 --> 08:22.435
and $60 worth of work
to get it out.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.738
I think I'll pass.

08:24.772 --> 08:28.609
- Well,
there's a few tools in here.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.377
Lights right there,
Kirby vacuum cleaner.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.779
A bucket full of tools there.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.582
In that bucket could be
$100 worth of tools, or $5.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.416
I'm hoping it's 100,
because I'm bidding.

08:36.449 --> 08:39.286
I like the skateboard,
I know it can hold me up.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.655
Big time.
They've got this tool box,

08:41.689 --> 08:43.223
couple of pieces of tools.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.625
What could be
the bad part about it,

08:44.658 --> 08:47.761
Ivy like all that paint
and all that stuff.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.162
Oh, then he going
to bid on this one, watch.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
- You should have
your own cowboy hat.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.801
- You know what, I'm going to
get me one made, custom made.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.302
- I tell you what,
get a ten gallon one.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.270
- Because you got a big head.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.839
- Yup.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.175
- 20.
- I'm on 20, now 30,

09:02.209 --> 09:03.510
bringing the bid to 40,
I've got the 40, have I got 45,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.212
50, have I got 55, 50, again.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.680
- 80.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.081
- Whoo!
- And now we're looking at 80,

09:08.115 --> 09:09.416
And a 5, 5,
anybody going to bid 5?

09:12.419 --> 09:13.453
Sold it to you, $80.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.223
Ivy won it,
Ivy won this one for 80.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.424
- Now I know
why I haven't been

09:17.457 --> 09:18.926
to Rancho Cucamonga
in a while.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.761
- Here I thought
you were a buyer, Dave.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.362
- I am a buyer.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.699
- Don't sound like it today.
- * Bye, bye, bye

09:25.733 --> 09:27.968
- You ain't a singer, either.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.536
- All righty, guys,
that's going to do it today.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.772
We are done, so head on out
this way with me,

09:31.805 --> 09:34.074
and we'll meet you
in the office and you can pay.

09:34.107 --> 09:37.344
And we'll see you next time.
- Oh, no stealing.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.780
- You don't see those.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.281
- No.
- Like, no wonder people steal

09:41.314 --> 09:43.083
at all the other places,
because they don't put up

09:43.116 --> 09:45.252
a sign that says "don't steal."
How would they know?

09:45.285 --> 09:47.655
- 80 bucks.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.656
Cheap day.
- I mean...

09:48.689 --> 09:49.857
How are you going
to make money?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.191
How much are you
going to make on that unit?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.827
- Well, it's not how much.
It's climb the ladder.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.062
Dollar, dollar, dollar.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.429
Take one dollar at a time
to get to a million.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.565
- I just, I don't see
how you can make money.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.000
Like, I don't see it.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.268
- You want to see
how I make money?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.236
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.772
I'll show you
how we make money.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.339
- Hey, you know you're
a professional auctioneer?

10:06.373 --> 10:07.440
- Yeah.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.442
- Well, I'm a
professional buyer.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.445
Let me show you
how to make money.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.414
- Okay.
- All right, I spent 80 bucks.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.849
- All right,
what's the first step?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.818
- So I'll grab this, you feel
free to grab something.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.152
- So what are we doing,
just like, line it?

10:19.186 --> 10:20.453
- Yup, just line it up.
- Okay.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.323
- We got 10 bucks here,
counting the little tote.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.457
- Christmas décor.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.558
I don't see any
value here, do you?

10:25.592 --> 10:26.694
- Two bucks in there.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.628
- Two bucks.
- Ooh, wow!

10:28.662 --> 10:31.164
How much on the buckets?
- One dollar a piece.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.233
Seven bucks right there.
We've got a dollar here.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.903
- Oh, hammer.
This is like a ladies' model.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.338
It's nice and small and light.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.372
- Two bucks.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.974
- $2!
- $2.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.075
- Blankets.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.376
- $2,
$2 right there.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.511
- Wait, you're going
to sell those?

10:44.544 --> 10:45.512
- I sell everything.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.080
- Gross.
- Rocks!

10:47.114 --> 10:50.083
These aren't just normal rocks,
these are like designer rocks.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.752
$2 worth of rocks.
- Okay.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.253
- Ooh, skateboard.
This is ten bucks.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.055
It's a cheapie.
Wow, when I say cheapie,

10:55.088 --> 10:56.690
I mean cheapie.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.191
- Yeah, yeah, still think
you can get 10 bucks?

10:58.225 --> 11:02.462
- Yeah. Man, now this is
what I call a good bad guitar.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.931
- You can't even
air guitar play that thing.

11:03.964 --> 11:04.932
- Sure you could.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.001
- Still two bucks.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.971
Ooh, I feel weight.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.040
- No paperwork, no paperwork.
- Maybe it's cash.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.575
- Whoo!

11:15.608 --> 11:16.643
- Whoo!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.546
- A slide projector.
- Yes, sir.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.548
Now, sometimes,
you put these slides online,

11:21.581 --> 11:23.350
if they've got
some cool stuff on them,

11:23.383 --> 11:26.086
or creepy stuff, or weird
stuff, you get extra money.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.487
- Anyways,

11:27.520 --> 11:28.488
this whole thing...
- All right this will work.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.223
- Assuming that works,
35 bucks.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.558
- Mmm, okay.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.026
- You want to know
what's wrong with this Kirby?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.728
- There's no cord.
- Exactly, so--

11:34.762 --> 11:36.263
- That's okay,
those are easy to find.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.931
- They're easy to find,
I'm just a little lazy.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.933
So I'll sell it as is.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.234
- 20 bucks.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.803
- Whoo, that's a steal
on a Kirby.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.872
- Yup, right there,
that's my money back.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.607
Everything else
is gravy on Ivy's cake.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.176
- Gravy, you like gravy
on your cake?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.510
I put gravy on everything.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.247
- A record player.
- Yeah.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.083
- Oh, sewing machine!

11:56.116 --> 11:57.417
- Hey, this is actually
a pretty clean one.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.551
- Singer.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.687
- 175 bucks for this,
case and all.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.522
- And you questioned me
about my locker.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.723
- Well, I didn't know
that was in here.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.826
- Professiah-nal.

12:05.859 --> 12:06.860
- Whatevs, okay.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.396
- Now right here,
that's 20 bucks.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.564
Is there anything in it?
Come on, be good, be good.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.500
- Ooh.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.868
Is that like,
a motor or something?

12:14.902 --> 12:17.737
- Yup, a weird looking motor.
Like a one cylinder.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.407
- Briggs and Stratton.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.441
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah!

12:21.474 --> 12:22.509
It's got compression.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.211
- Here's a steering wheel.
- Uh-huh.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.413
- We got this.
- Oh, there's the muffler.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.514
- So what is this, like,
a little like--

12:27.547 --> 12:28.748
- That probably
hooks right there.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.653
And there's
the carburetor, yes!

12:33.686 --> 12:35.055
I love taking stuff apart,

12:35.088 --> 12:37.757
but putting it together
is a whole different story.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.793
Time to seek professional help.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.995
All right, I just want to hear
one thing before I leave.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.031
- You know what I wanna hear.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.799
- Professiah-nal.
- There we go.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.101
- Let's load it up.

12:48.135 --> 12:51.905
Job ain't done yet.
Come on.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.075
- Oh, I hope there's
good stuff in here.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.310
- It looks good.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.016
We've got a long way to go

13:03.050 --> 13:04.952
to recoup the 1,800
that we spent.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.753
- Let's hope
winging it pays off.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.221
- Glove up, bro.
- It looks dirty.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.322
Hope it doesn't
mess up my shoes.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.158
- It does look dirty.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.161
- Okay, nothing in here...

13:14.194 --> 13:15.863
Good.
- Whoa, that's heavy.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.931
Oh, that's coming down.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
Box going down.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.003
- Okay.
- Come check this out.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.471
What do you think, 50 bucks?

13:24.504 --> 13:26.373
- Sure, oh, my God.
- I know, it's heavy.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.979
- That the chandelier,
babe, be careful.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.446
- Very fragile.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.948
- It says
"Christmas decorations."

13:34.982 --> 13:37.918
- How about this, uh, 30 bucks.
- Okay, $30.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.453
- Nope.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.090
This unit stinks, Jay.
It's garbage.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.425
- It's garbage, I know.
- All of it.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.961
No money in any of these boxes.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.297
- Oh, look at this,
a box of hangers.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.565
That's smart.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.035
What do you think, babe?
You think we can sell these?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.704
Princess house coffee cups?
- Sure.

13:57.737 --> 14:01.441
- Ain't gonna get much;
maybe 20 bucks for the box.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.642
Maybe 10.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.144
- You're an idiot.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.980
- Things aren't looking good up
from this side here, babe.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.581
- Yeah.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.283
- You're kidding.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.253
It's funny, because you're
like being sarcastic,

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
and it seems like you're
kind of enjoying me failing.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.458
But guess what, I spent your
money too on this unit.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.826
- Oh, I am aware.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.096
Well, I'm gonna say
50 bucks of costume jewelry.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.099
- Now we're over 100.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.169
- I'm going to sit here
until you change your attitude.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.371
- My attitude with change when
we start making some money.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.076
- Look at this,
an unlocked lock box.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.744
There's no surprise,
I didn't even get to smash it.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.847
Look, it's just empty.
- Jarrod, this unit sucks.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.516
- This one here is no value,
it's just clothes and stuff.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.686
- Okay.
- Sad, sad day.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.055
- Is it too early
to go to the bar?

14:48.088 --> 14:50.023
What time is it?
- Ooh, Brandi.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.359
- I found it.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.794
- You're going to say
this may be

14:54.827 --> 14:56.196
the best thing
in this locker.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.898
- Okay.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.700
- Yeah.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.535
- Looks well made.
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.404
- Open it up.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.074
- Shut the Box!
- Oh, my God.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.141
- This is our favorite game.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.876
- Look at this,
it's three rows.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.778
This is our favorite, it's a
board game, Shut the Box.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.713
You roll the dice
and you close the tiles.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.415
- Oh, my God.
- And this is like

15:15.448 --> 15:16.416
an expensive, well made,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.418
three row--
- Look at that.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.819
- That's way better
than the one we have.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.554
- It's nice.
- Maybe we should get somebody

15:21.588 --> 15:22.655
to look at it.
- Okay.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.457
- I mean, it looks
very well made.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.858
- It really is,
it's super heavy.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.294
- Yeah, so,
I'd get it checked out

15:27.327 --> 15:28.795
just so we can
go to a toy store.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.465
Well, maybe this game
will be worth 1700 bucks,

15:32.499 --> 15:34.334
and we'll break even.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.405
What's a trim twist?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.707
- You stand on it and you
twist, it's the original.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.009
- Let me see it, let me see it.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.076
- Yeah, that'll
get you a workout.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.744
Ready, coming out, it's heavy.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.414
There you go.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.581
- Now, unfortunately, Brandi,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.250
that's the last thing in here.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.886
- This thing is awesome.
Hold on, whoa.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.589
- I don't know.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.724
- I'm at the end
of the unit here.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.326
The fridge doesn't work,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.494
everything else
in here is garbage.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.862
- Except this thing.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.631
- You want to twist our way
out of here?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.666
- Uh-huh.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.603
- Come on, let's roll.

16:10.637 --> 16:16.976
I'm going to puke.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.348
- Danny!

16:22.715 --> 16:24.884
I'm taking my motor
to my buddy, Danny.

16:24.917 --> 16:28.255
If it uses gas and goes fast,
he knows all about it.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.457
Looks like you got
gold in the box here, man.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.524
- Yeah, looks like it.

16:31.558 --> 16:32.759
- What we've got here

16:32.792 --> 16:34.927
is a Briggs and Stratton
world formula engine.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.564
As small as it is,
it's a 206 cc motor

16:37.597 --> 16:39.032
that's pumping between
12 and 14 horsepower.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.268
- Packing quite a bit
of power there.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.469
You could definitely
hit anywhere

16:42.502 --> 16:43.870
from 60 to 70 miles an hour
with that setup.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.473
- Whoo, good, because I don't
like to go under 50.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.807
- Let's see, we've got
some additional parts.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.077
We've got an air filter,
a starter Solenoid.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.045
We do have our exhaust fitter,
that's important.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.646
We got a Wahl Bros.
slide carb here.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.116
You got most of our parts here,
so the next step here,

16:56.149 --> 16:58.051
does she run?
Have you done anything with it?

16:58.085 --> 16:59.152
- No, threw it in the box,
brought it to you.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.620
- Threw it in the box,
sounds like Ivy.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.422
- You know I'm lazy,
I just bring you crap.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.023
- All right, let's see
if she fires up or not.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.358
Put a little bit
of ether in the intake.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.028
Give her a pull.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.702
- It works.
- And she runs.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.370
- I know what that means.
- And that means money.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.671
.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.773
- Well, we know it works now.
- That's right.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.175
- Do I got all of the parts,
some of the parts?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.476
- You're pretty much complete,

17:23.510 --> 17:25.278
you've even got
a vintage steering wheel here.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.813
Depending on
whether you want to

17:26.846 --> 17:29.149
install it
on the vehicle or not,

17:29.182 --> 17:30.650
this is definitely
one of those items

17:30.683 --> 17:31.884
that the guy who's trying
to build a vintage go kart

17:31.918 --> 17:33.220
was looking for.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.155
- An engine that's running,
with all the parts.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.725
Where you think I'm at?
- In the condition it's in...

17:41.694 --> 17:43.163
I'd say probably about 450.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.099
- Whoo! Now that's
what I call fast money.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.367
- We got to go
for a little cruise.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.001
- Sounds like a deal.
- All right, let's do it.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.216
- Hi.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.584
- Hi, welcome to
Wood Expressions.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.818
- We're meeting Ron Reyes,

18:05.852 --> 18:07.720
president of
Wood Expression Games,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.722
to find out more
about Shut the Box.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.324
All right,
this is what we have.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.559
- All right,
let's check this out.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.793
- Look at all these.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.128
- We have all kinds
of Shut the Box games.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.196
- I see that
- This is one of our

18:16.229 --> 18:17.564
most popular games
that we have.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.065
- And it is so fun.
- We just discovered it, yeah.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.066
- Do you know
the history of the game?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.434
- I have no idea.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.336
- So this is an old game,

18:23.370 --> 18:24.571
from a couple
hundred years ago.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.872
Off the coast of Normandy,

18:25.905 --> 18:29.409
the fisherman would go out
to sea and work all day.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.178
And they'd come back
in the evening

18:31.211 --> 18:33.713
and use this game to drink
and gamble their earnings away.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.047
So, uh...
- That's what we do.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.749
- Kind of our, uh, yeah.
- Same thing.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.118
- I think Jarrod's already done
enough gambling and losing.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.320
- This is a
really nice version.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.454
One of the nice things is

18:41.488 --> 18:44.123
the tiles look
to be stone or marble.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.194
The dice, some time and energy
was put into the dice alone.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.728
What that means is,
whenever you roll these dice,

18:48.761 --> 18:50.062
there would be no balance.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.498
When you roll it,
it rolls true,

18:51.531 --> 18:55.101
So this is certainly a very
premium version of the game.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.904
- It's heavy,
the bottom is really solid.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.572
- Yeah, it looks to be
like a cherry wood.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.674
- I think they inlaid
some other kind of--

19:01.708 --> 19:04.110
- Yeah, it looks like it,
almost like a burl.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.144
Burl wood inlay.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.513
In ways, it looks
like an antique,

19:06.546 --> 19:08.215
and in other ways,
it's very modern.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.617
- Do you think that a game
like this was mass produced,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.385
or was it more like,
hand put together?

19:12.419 --> 19:15.154
- I would say it was produced
on a very limited basis.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.956
- That means value.
- That does help.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.491
If you were to find this
in a retail store,

19:18.525 --> 19:19.826
it would not be
for the faint of heart.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.728
This would be a pricy game.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.664
Roll the dice?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.699
Find out how much it's worth?

19:26.733 --> 19:30.002
Huh? Stop playing games,
what can we get for this?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.271
- This is a very nice version.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.740
Again, a lot of energy
put into this.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.608
Really nicely manufactured.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.544
The value on this game...

19:41.381 --> 19:43.583
I would say a good 250.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.718
That's awesome.
- That's awesome, yeah.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.487
Yeah, that's awesome,
but we still lost

19:47.520 --> 19:49.356
a boxload of money
on this unit.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.357
- All right,
you want to try this one?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.491
- Yeah.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.892
We gonna all roll
at the same time?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.327
Oh, this is going
to get dangerous.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.462
- It is.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.063
- One, two, three.
- All right.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.698
- Oh, my God,
you already bumped my dice,

19:58.731 --> 19:59.732
right out the gate.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.868
- That is not good.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.203
This is too intense.
Come on, best score.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.672
Oh, my God.
- Blue.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.773
- I'm getting crushed
right now.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.841
- I think I won.
- I think you won.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.142
- I am the professional.
- You did win, you did win.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.611
- That's not, it's his game,
that's not fair.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.083
narrator: Ivy Calvin
proved to be a professiah-nal,

20:17.116 --> 20:20.086
racing ahead with $660

20:20.119 --> 20:22.589
Kenny Crossley
didn't do it this time,

20:22.622 --> 20:25.091
barely clearing 25 bucks.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.894
Dave Hester left
on a sour note.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.796
- * Bye, bye, bye

20:29.829 --> 20:31.864
narrator:
Laying a big goose egg.

20:31.898 --> 20:36.035
While Jarrod and Brandi rolled
the dice and shut the box

20:36.068 --> 20:39.038
on any sort of profit.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.673
- I'd like to thank
the auctioneer,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.809
for giving me a good price
on all this stuff,

20:42.842 --> 20:44.411
letting me bid on the unit.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.546
And I'd like to thank
the other auction buyers.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.881
For not bidding me up
on this spectacular unit.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.218
So I could get
this beautiful patio set.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.823
Patio set for 55 bucks
and some change.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.858
And um, thank you, America.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.159
This is for you.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.962
It's not just for Kenny.
This is for the world.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.030
Kumbaya.
