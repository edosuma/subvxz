00:03.130 --> 00:05.160
So you know it's Macpherson.

00:05.230 --> 00:06.400
I'm right.

00:06.460 --> 00:07.900
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

00:07.960 --> 00:11.060
And he now has a sword
which renders him invisible.

00:11.130 --> 00:12.930
Now it's up to you to stop him.

00:21.930 --> 00:24.330
You always hurt the one you love.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.730
Artie?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.120
No, no, no, no!

00:36.560 --> 00:38.330
Okay, just stop.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.530
Okay, stop and think this through.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.100
Uh...guess what.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.730
I'm still taking the artifact.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.200
I can't let you do that, Pete.

00:45.260 --> 00:49.200
Turn around.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
14 hours earlier

01:06.960 --> 01:08.330
No.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.660
Macpherson is alive and

01:09.730 --> 01:11.030
Loose somewhere in the world.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.760
Stopping Macpherson
is not your job!

01:12.830 --> 01:14.060
My what?

01:14.130 --> 01:17.230
Protecting the world
happens to be my job!

01:17.300 --> 01:19.000
And right now that
is being threatened

01:19.060 --> 01:21.100
By an insane ex-warehouse agent

01:21.160 --> 01:24.000
Who is competing for artifacts
that belong right out there

01:24.060 --> 01:25.880
Mrs. Frederic said
that she will handle it.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.200
I can do it.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.930
Artie, he ran a sword
through your chest.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.630
I'm all right.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.740
You could have died.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.300
Please just let Mrs.
Frederic handle it, okay?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.160
This?

01:41.230 --> 01:43.230
This is your job, Artie.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.700
And you're not doing it.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.100
You have Pete, Myka, and Claudia

01:48.160 --> 01:49.630
Spread out through the warehouse

01:49.700 --> 01:51.730
Taking inventory for
you day after day.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.000
Meanwhile, all

01:53.060 --> 01:54.550
Meanwhile, these
things are piling up.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.700
Yes, they are.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.630
I'm pretty hard to kill.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.930
Pete?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.730
Really? Really? You
want some of that?

02:16.530 --> 02:19.230
Pete?

02:19.300 --> 02:20.500
Ooh, nice one.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.660
Did not see that coming.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.130
Playing with yourself again?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.430
One game. A quickie.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.760
We got time.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.200
Besides, none of this
stuff's going anywhere.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.500
Right, buddy?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.760
Okay, this stuff is
dangerous, all right?

02:33.830 --> 02:35.030
Rght.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.130
This is Lewis Carroll's mirror.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.900
Alice in wonderland.

02:37.900 --> 02:38.560
"Off with their heads."

02:38.630 --> 02:40.460
- That's chick lit, right?
- Chick lit?

02:40.530 --> 02:41.600
Right. Come on.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.060
Not everything in
here is dangerous.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.330
You got that cuddly little
ferret from a cooking pot.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.460
Yeah, he peed in my shoes.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.500
That's that was me.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.230
That's funny.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.660
So what, are you
still mad at Artie?

02:52.730 --> 02:55.300
No.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.060
No, I'm not.

02:57.130 --> 02:58.600
I'm not mad at Artie.

02:58.660 --> 02:59.930
I'm mad at you.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.230
- No, you're not mad at me.
- Yes, I am.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.820
You're not mad at me.
You're not mad at me.

03:02.830 --> 03:04.200
Because when you're mad at me,

03:04.260 --> 03:05.860
Your neck gets all long
until it looks like that.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.360
It's like a giraffe over here.

03:07.430 --> 03:08.800
And then when you're mad at Artie,

03:08.860 --> 03:10.200
Your neck gets down
over here to the right.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.760
Yes!

03:11.830 --> 03:14.700
Just like that.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.500
Look, I know the Macpherson-D.C.
thing is still bugging you, okay?

03:17.560 --> 03:19.560
But everybody has a past.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.400
But he lied, Pete.

03:21.460 --> 03:24.730
Artie's past is more
treasonous, hazardous, and, hey,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.460
There's a crazy man who wants us
dead and he wants the warehouse

03:27.530 --> 03:28.860
All for himself.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.330
Would have been nice
knowing that going in, pete.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.100
Artie should have told
us about Macpherson

03:32.360 --> 03:33.930
Don't you think?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.500
Yes, yes, I get it.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.960
Daddy issues.

03:38.030 --> 03:39.260
Can't deal with the old man

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
You know what? You're useless

03:40.430 --> 03:41.050
Oh, my god! The mirror!

03:41.430 --> 03:42.050
I got it. Watch out.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.800
Studio 54 disco ball.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.560
Sick.

04:01.940 --> 04:03.270
That's?

04:03.580 --> 04:04.900
That sounds like...

04:08.880 --> 04:11.680
The studio 54 disco ball

04:12.800 --> 04:14.910
Oh, god, I hate disco.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.060
Myka!

04:31.130 --> 04:33.200
Myka, you okay?

04:33.330 --> 04:35.760
Hey! What's going on?

04:35.830 --> 04:39.060
Myka, you okay?

04:39.130 --> 04:41.300
What's going on? Huh?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.960
Ask him.

04:45.030 --> 04:47.730
You can't

05:30.400 --> 05:32.300
Warehouse 13 S01E09

04:52.500 --> 04:59.260
仅供学习 禁止用于任何商业盈利行为

05:35.340 --> 05:36.570
What?

05:36.640 --> 05:39.370
Artie's past, Macpherson...

05:39.440 --> 05:41.100
It can be a bit disorienting.

05:41.170 --> 05:42.240
I know.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.070
I feel pretty clear actually.

05:45.140 --> 05:47.170
Things are the way they are.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.300
Don't fight it.

05:48.370 --> 05:50.400
Just go with it.

05:50.470 --> 05:55.300
Whenever I don't, I always end
up right back in the same place.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.570
Not a good one.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.040
Thank you for the tea.

06:00.100 --> 06:04.900
You're welcome.

06:04.970 --> 06:06.240
Hey. I'm gonna do it.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.470
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.070
They're excellent, yes.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.640
I don't know what

06:15.700 --> 06:17.100
So, uh, today's... where is

06:17.170 --> 06:18.670
Pete, in the room, please!

06:18.740 --> 06:19.940
You do something
different with your hair?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.470
Would you help me with this bag?

06:22.540 --> 06:23.400
Just open it up, take everything

06:23.470 --> 06:24.840
Dude, dude, take your meds.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.140
I want a turn, bro.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.570
Pete, sit.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.270
- You saved at least? 
- I saved.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.370
Thank you.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.170
Focus, focus!

06:34.240 --> 06:35.600
W-w-w-w-w-wait,
what are you doing?

06:35.670 --> 06:36.740
Focusing.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.400
No, no, no, no. you don't

06:38.440 --> 06:41.200
We're gonna, we, you

06:41.270 --> 06:43.240
All right, never mind, fine.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.940
All right, just try
try pay attention

06:45.000 --> 06:46.370
I think I've got a case for you.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.000
Gary and Jillian
Witman, take one each

06:50.070 --> 06:53.600
Aka more aliases than
they would care to mention.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.240
They are small-time thieves

06:55.300 --> 06:57.370
Who have inexplicably
hit the big-time.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.800
- I smell artifact.
- I smell a loser.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.400
- Um, uh, no
- Claudia.

07:01.470 --> 07:02.700
Come on.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.900
Claudia!

07:06.770 --> 07:08.800
Let's let Artie get through this

07:08.870 --> 07:12.370
So we can just not be here any
longer than necessary, all right?

07:12.440 --> 07:13.740
Thank you very much, Myka .

07:13.800 --> 07:15.100
Much appreciated.

07:15.170 --> 07:17.570
You're welcome.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.740
So what is this, um

07:19.800 --> 07:21.540
- What is this artifact?
- No, no, it's unconfirmed.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.340
But if there is one,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.740
It's given these two an
unbelievable amount of luck.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.300
The kind of define of
luck is the probablility of

07:26.300 --> 07:29.770
They went straight from Miami
to Troy and Atlantic city

07:29.840 --> 07:31.940
And they've not not one
single gaming commission

07:32.000 --> 07:33.170
Alarm bell has been tripped.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.170
Well, how?

07:34.240 --> 07:37.600
How,well, they go into a
gaming room as high rollers.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.540
Anybody? Okay.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.270
And, um, they're really good.

07:41.340 --> 07:45.040
And they win just enough money
to stay under the radar, right?

07:45.100 --> 07:46.740
And then they get

07:46.800 --> 07:48.370
Fine.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.240
Then they move on and
they don't get caught.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.300
Okay, so they're taking a
little back from the house.

07:52.370 --> 07:54.100
o-m-g 
what's b-f-b?

07:54.170 --> 07:56.170
What?

07:56.240 --> 08:01.570
Iniquitous hands with
the means to exploit fate.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.240
"Iniquitous" means "bad."

08:03.300 --> 08:04.570
Thanks, Roget.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.470
So where are they now?

08:06.540 --> 08:07.860
Three hours ago, they checked into

08:07.870 --> 08:10.640
Room 1510 at the Maximus
hotel in Las Vegas.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.640
So I've also prepared
a rundown,this is yours

08:13.700 --> 08:16.040
Of possible artifacts
that are still in the wild

08:16.100 --> 08:17.540
That might be responsible.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.570
And there's also plane tickets and
reservations for the Maximus and all that stuff.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.200
Oh, Vegas, baby.

08:22.270 --> 08:23.440
Kicking it

08:23.500 --> 08:25.240
Where's the money?

08:25.300 --> 08:28.100
Well, we need to roll high.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.070
Yeah, there's $10,000
in Pete's envelope.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.570
Oh, snap!

08:34.840 --> 08:37.539
Doubt it.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.799
- Do you,are you sure this 
- Get out.

08:38.870 --> 08:41.539
Get out. Pack.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.740
Boys.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.070
Hey, hey. Do me a favor.

08:46.140 --> 08:47.540
Yes, yes, yes, my liege.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.140
I shall bring you receipts.

08:49.200 --> 08:52.140
Yeah, that too, but
also, one more thing.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.500
Is she mad at me?

08:53.570 --> 08:55.540
- No.
- Okay.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.040
Yes. Maybe.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.900
A little.

08:58.970 --> 09:01.870
But look, a trip to Vegas
will un-bunch the pants.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.670
You know, it should be fun.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.770
No, no, no, no, no.
Please don't have fun.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.940
Yeah, or crap out.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.400
That's so funny.

09:08.470 --> 09:10.470
Later.

09:10.540 --> 09:11.700
So what am I doing?

09:11.770 --> 09:12.940
What do you mean
what are you doing?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.200
Well, Leena told me
Mrs. "F" was keeping you

09:15.270 --> 09:16.800
Off the Macpherson
trail, so it doesn't mean

09:16.870 --> 09:18.170
I can't look for him.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.800
I'm only gonna say this
once.  Are you listening?

09:19.870 --> 09:21.770
- Yeah. 
- Back off!

09:21.840 --> 09:24.370
The man will kill you. Kill you.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.470
Understood?

09:25.540 --> 09:27.340
Yeah. Yes, Sir.

09:38.340 --> 09:45.340
Las Vegas

10:26.900 --> 10:28.370
Hello.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.470
- How are you? 
- All right.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.500
Va-va-voom.

10:44.570 --> 10:46.000
Your tie is crooked.

10:46.070 --> 10:47.740
Well, you just knocked
everything crooked.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.770
How are my teeth?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.240
Your teeth are fine.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.240
Perfume?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
Mm-hmm.

10:52.370 --> 10:54.200
That's a first.

10:58.170 --> 11:01.170
So I've been going
over the possibles.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.900
And I've been sniffing ten grand.

11:04.970 --> 11:09.600
Nothing in Artie's hit list
suggests a multi-part object,

11:09.670 --> 11:11.680
Which means we're
looking for one thing

11:11.680 --> 11:12.840
And it should be
in their possession.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.300
Why?

11:14.370 --> 11:16.370
It's Carson's rule
of linear transfer.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.640
Gesundheit.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.000
It means they have
to have it on them.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.200
Forced outcomes require tangency.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.970
Someone's been paying attention.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.340
Some of us longer than others.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.670
Okay, well,

11:29.680 --> 11:33.100
Let's assume that it is a single
artifact shared by two suspects.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.400
Well, we each take one
and we compare notes.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.040
Okay. I'll take lady luck.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.440
You take her date.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.740
Oh, and I got these.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.670
What is it?

11:41.740 --> 11:44.700
I cleaned 'em with
alcohol, all right?

11:44.770 --> 11:48.070
So and a little bit of spit.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.300
Kidding.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.140
Testing.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.140
Sorry.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.870
Oh, you have the Tesla, right?

11:57.940 --> 11:59.070
Yes.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.370
I'll trade you for the Farnsworth.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.970
But you have the gun.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.540
I know, but it's the boring one.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.300
Well, you lost the toss.

12:05.370 --> 12:06.500
I know.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.040
Let's just go find this artifact

12:08.100 --> 12:10.170
And see if we can't
change somebody's luck.

12:15.570 --> 12:17.240
Okay, that thing is so freaky.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.500
What, this? yeah.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.300
No, the thing behind
you. yeah, that.

12:20.370 --> 12:27.440
Well, trapped desires refracted
by light, sound, sex...

12:27.500 --> 12:30.800
Mind-altering drugs
into a disco ball.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.100
Disco ball.

12:31.170 --> 12:32.670
- A disco ball. 
- I know. I know.

12:32.740 --> 12:34.700
- Dude, how?
- Well, unknown, unknown.

12:34.770 --> 12:37.200
But, I mean, mirrors are
usually Just gonna reflect light,

12:37.270 --> 12:40.030
But this thing projects

12:40.030 --> 12:42.800
Yearnings and cravings.

12:42.870 --> 12:44.740
You know what this thing does?

12:44.800 --> 12:54.540
It imparts a grim stampeding
inhumanity against anything decent.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.340
You asked.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.870
Don't worry. no, not in here.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.240
In here it's just a
round, shiny object.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.640
- But out there. 
- It's the '80s.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.900
It's...the '70s.

13:03.970 --> 13:08.470
By the way, I'm sorry I came down
on you a little hard at Leena's.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.000
You know, it's whatever.

13:10.070 --> 13:11.270
It's just 'cause I
owe you, you know,

13:11.340 --> 13:13.070
For helping me and saving Joshua.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.470
I mean, the guy hurt you, you know?

13:14.540 --> 13:15.840
- It pisses me off. 
- Yeah, yeah.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.570
- If finding Macpherson 
- Okay, okay.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.770
Just help me lift this
thing, would you, on three.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.840
Well, can Mrs. Frederic find him?

13:22.900 --> 13:24.070
I don't know. on three.

13:24.140 --> 13:27.040
One, two, three.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.940
Well, the guy used to
work here though, right?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.800
And, what, the
place drove him nuts?

13:30.870 --> 13:32.600
Something lured him
to the dark side?

13:32.670 --> 13:35.700
He is the dark side and
things are lured to him,

13:35.770 --> 13:36.400
People especially,

13:36.470 --> 13:38.970
Which is why You're never gonna
mention his name ever again.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.470
-Just to you. 
- To anyone, promise me.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.400
Yes!

13:52.700 --> 13:55.170
Is that Myka?

13:55.240 --> 13:57.240
Whatever it is...

13:57.300 --> 13:58.940
It's not good.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.370
Artie!

14:11.650 --> 14:13.910
Red five.

14:13.980 --> 14:15.610
You're pushing our luck.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.780
Yeah, and it's pushing right back.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.080
Take a break.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.550
I'm okay.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.310
We've got enough, okay?

14:21.380 --> 14:22.380
Nobody's legs are getting broken.

14:22.450 --> 14:23.680
Everybody's paid off.

14:23.750 --> 14:27.110
Well, college for five
kids won't be cheap.

14:27.180 --> 14:29.180
We're having three.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.910
And that won't matter if you're
not around for honey moon.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.680
Oh, I'll be around.

14:33.750 --> 14:37.210
It's gonna be the best
years of our lives.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.480
Just five more spins.

14:39.550 --> 14:40.680
Three.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.680
Okay, we've found them.

14:44.310 --> 14:45.380
You see anything?

14:45.450 --> 14:48.110
Besides two scoundrels in love?

14:48.180 --> 14:50.250
No, but they might
have something off-site.

14:50.310 --> 14:51.980
All right, I'm gonna
go toss their room.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.680
Call me if you see them
chewing on a rabbit's foot

14:54.750 --> 14:57.210
Or adjusting a magic girdle.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.110
Red 23.

15:04.750 --> 15:05.980
Careful!

15:06.050 --> 15:07.780
- Stop yelling! 
- Start listening!

15:07.850 --> 15:09.150
I'm so running over your toes.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.280
All right, just get it straight.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.850
- Not like that! 
- Okay!

15:11.910 --> 15:13.180
Could you close
the door behind you?

15:13.250 --> 15:14.710
- Got it. 
- All right, you know what?

15:14.780 --> 15:16.580
Pull all the Dodgson
files, would you?

15:16.650 --> 15:18.650
And pull anything that's
got a listed cross-reference,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.510
Like Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.980
What are you still
standing here for?

15:22.050 --> 15:23.280
- So go pull files. 
- I'm not your girl friday.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.550
Go and... What kept you?

15:25.610 --> 15:27.750
Three pumpkin pies and
a broken oven thermostat

15:27.810 --> 15:29.010
That you keep promising to fix.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.480
What's this?

15:31.550 --> 15:35.750
Well, this is why I called you.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.050
Artie, what happened?

15:38.110 --> 15:39.880
Yeah, optical divagation, I think.

15:39.950 --> 15:41.080
What?

15:41.150 --> 15:43.680
Kind of like a retinal
flare after a photo flash.

15:43.750 --> 15:48.710
My best guess is the
blast from the disco ball,

15:48.780 --> 15:51.110
It kind of fritzed this mirror's
primary reflective capacity

15:51.180 --> 15:54.850
And then it probably
clipped part of Myka's psyche

15:54.910 --> 15:56.280
And fused it in there.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.810
You know, it's kind of like
shadows on a wall after Hiroshima.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.180
It's a pretty lively shadow.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.880
Yes, but is it?

16:03.950 --> 16:05.180
- Is it what? 
- Alive.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.250
Help!

16:08.310 --> 16:09.550
You want to?

16:09.610 --> 16:11.150
Sure.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.780
Uh, what's that about?

16:16.850 --> 16:19.510
I'm gonna pull her
back if she falls in.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.250
-Get your mind out of the 
- Oh, hell.

16:35.610 --> 16:36.750
- Okay. 
- Thanks.

16:36.810 --> 16:37.980
- So? 
- Nothing.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.180
So what is it? Just a shadow play?

16:39.250 --> 16:41.280
Well, the glass is like a barrier.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.050
If that's alive, I can't tell.

16:43.110 --> 16:44.180
Let's just ask her.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.480
"It."

16:45.550 --> 16:47.850
"It, it..." might have
something to tell us.

16:47.910 --> 16:49.380
I mean, why can't
we just talk to her?

16:49.450 --> 16:51.880
Because we do not converse
with reflective entities, okay?

16:51.950 --> 16:53.150
Because?

16:53.210 --> 16:55.410
Because two words. "Bloody Mary."

16:55.480 --> 16:57.550
That's just an urban
legend though, right?

16:57.610 --> 16:58.950
Of course it isn't.

16:59.010 --> 17:01.410
Shadows have power and
you let this thing speak

17:01.480 --> 17:04.010
And there is no telling
what could happen.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.010
Pete was playing ping-pong
with one of those things.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.180
Weren't you supposed to
go pull files or something?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.950
Thank you.

17:12.010 --> 17:13.380
Okay, and oh!

17:13.450 --> 17:14.480
And pull anything from studio 54.

17:14.550 --> 17:15.680
Got it.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.050
- 54. 
- Heard you.

17:17.109 --> 17:18.480
Can I make a suggestion?

17:18.550 --> 17:20.680
Ah! sure.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.079
I haven't lost a penny, mom.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.310
Myka with you?

17:29.380 --> 17:31.550
No, she's downstairs
on the Whitmans.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.310
I'm getting ready
to search their room.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.810
What's up?

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
How's your radar?

17:37.250 --> 17:38.880
You mean am I having
a vibe or something?

17:38.950 --> 17:40.110
Yeah.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.410
Give it a second.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.250
Anything out of the ordinary?

17:44.310 --> 17:45.810
Anything at all.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.210
With Myka?

17:47.280 --> 17:49.950
With anything.

17:50.010 --> 17:52.410
You know, now that you
mention it, there is something.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.450
What?

17:54.510 --> 17:57.110
The buffet is overpriced.

17:59.350 --> 18:00.910
Yeah, other than that?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.980
Nope. No vibe. No trouble.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.110
It's all good.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.050
All right. Yeah, okay.

18:06.110 --> 18:07.150
Are you sure?

18:07.210 --> 18:09.110
Artie...

18:09.180 --> 18:10.680
Is there something I should know?

18:10.750 --> 18:12.150
No, no, no, no.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.650
Everything's good. It's
just a status check.

18:13.710 --> 18:14.710
Don't dawdle, stay
in touch, good-bye.

18:14.780 --> 18:17.410
Kirk out.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.950
He's fine.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.950
So is Myka. Okay?

18:21.010 --> 18:22.850
Okay.

19:27.410 --> 19:29.580
Myka.

19:29.650 --> 19:30.610
Yes?

19:30.680 --> 19:31.780
I got nothing.

19:31.850 --> 19:35.580
Yeah, nothing's going
on down here either.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.500
They're still winning

19:37.500 --> 19:41.480
And I'll be damned If I know how

19:41.550 --> 19:42.980
Yeah, I know. I am. I am.

19:43.050 --> 19:44.910
I just think that that's…

19:44.980 --> 19:46.580
What if maybe if you
put those two together…

19:46.650 --> 19:48.250
I don't think that's gonna work.

19:48.310 --> 19:49.280
What about what we tried in…

19:49.350 --> 19:50.380
What is that?

19:50.450 --> 19:53.850
Just something I whipped up

19:53.910 --> 19:55.480
What do you mean? Just now?

19:55.550 --> 19:57.180
Yeah, that's right.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.880
W-w-w-w-wait,
wait, wait.

19:58.950 --> 20:00.580
What are you doing?

20:00.650 --> 20:02.980
Opening a line of communication.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.150
CIA uses laser mics

20:05.150 --> 20:06.380
To read vibrations
off windows to hear

20:06.380 --> 20:08.480
What's going on on the other
side Of the window, right?

20:08.550 --> 20:09.680
Yeah.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.980
I want to hear what she has to say.

20:11.050 --> 20:13.810
Bloody Mary, shadows
have power, I get it.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.450
But what if that's not
just a shadow, Artie?

20:15.510 --> 20:18.850
Artie, that look on her face
is somebody who's trapped.

20:18.910 --> 20:22.480
Believe me, I know
that look and so do you.

20:22.550 --> 20:25.980
If things get hinky,
you can pull the plug.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.550
What do you got to lose, okay?

20:27.610 --> 20:29.480
I do need to do this.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.850
- I just… 
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

20:33.910 --> 20:35.710
Let me think!

20:52.150 --> 20:54.650
Myka.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.680
Myka, where are…

21:00.810 --> 21:02.310
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.610
No sign of any artifact.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.950
Not even a glimmer.

21:05.010 --> 21:06.850
- What's up with his hand? 
- I don't know.

21:06.910 --> 21:08.450
Look, if you want to get some
rest, I'll stay with them.

21:08.510 --> 21:09.950
Not if they split up.

21:10.010 --> 21:15.250
If they do, I'll call you.

21:15.310 --> 21:16.850
No, no. Let's…

21:16.910 --> 21:18.280
Let's stay together.

21:18.350 --> 21:19.100
If they've got something,

21:19.100 --> 21:19.780
It's on 'em.

21:19.850 --> 21:21.680
I want to know what it is.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.250
I've been burned by this before.

21:33.310 --> 21:34.510
They look real

21:34.510 --> 21:35.710
And they'll say anything.

21:35.780 --> 21:38.580
Say something.

21:38.650 --> 21:40.310
Artie, when I get out of here,

21:40.380 --> 21:43.150
I'm hugging her and
I'm kicking your ass.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.880
Yeah, well, that
won't be happening.

21:44.950 --> 21:46.010
Artie. Artie, It's me.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.350
No, no.

21:48.410 --> 21:49.750
You're just a reflection.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.040
The real Myka's in Las Vegas

21:51.040 --> 21:52.280
On a mission with Pete.

21:52.350 --> 21:53.610
What? No, no, I'm not!

21:53.680 --> 21:55.050
Artie!

21:55.110 --> 21:56.350
See?

21:56.410 --> 21:57.880
That's exactly what I mean.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.180
You just don't do it.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.450
Turn that thing off.

22:00.510 --> 22:01.850
Artie, if I'm in Vegas with Pete,

22:01.910 --> 22:03.150
Then how can I be here?

22:03.210 --> 22:05.080
Just  No! Just don't turn it off!

22:05.150 --> 22:07.080
Artie! No!

22:07.150 --> 22:08.210
Artie!

22:08.280 --> 22:09.550
Whatever that thing is,

22:09.610 --> 22:11.050
It's never getting out of here.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.530
Lewis Carroll's Alice.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.530
You're so sweet, so innocent,

22:22.300 --> 22:24.060
So not true.

22:24.130 --> 22:27.660
This woman was as mad as a Hatter.

22:27.730 --> 22:29.730
And Charles Dodgson,
aka Lewis Carroll,

22:29.800 --> 22:31.430
Was not writing books.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.060
He was chronicling this
young woman's descent

22:34.130 --> 22:39.030
Into a sociopathic madness
in all of his books.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.630
He didn't write these books.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.160
These are warehouse fabrications

22:43.160 --> 22:44.350
Brilliant fabrications…

22:44.350 --> 22:46.670
To hide the truth
about that mirror.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.760
Here's a report from
warehouse field agents.

22:49.830 --> 22:51.160
Yeah.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.260
The mirror crossed
paths with Alice Liddell.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.830
I bet it crossed paths. When?

22:54.900 --> 22:55.760
Well, right before the murders.

22:55.830 --> 22:56.960
That's terrifying.

22:57.030 --> 22:59.530
Yeah, and there's no mention
of where the mirror came from.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.800
Okay, well, where do any
of these things come from?

23:01.860 --> 23:05.130
Artie, these agents, they
trapped her inside of the mirror.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.800
Yeah.

23:06.860 --> 23:08.600
Somehow her energy, her essence…

23:08.660 --> 23:10.530
Even they weren't
sure how it happened.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.330
Wouldn't it have been nice, Leena,

23:12.400 --> 23:14.500
If these warehouse field agents

23:14.560 --> 23:17.700
Had bothered to figure it out
before she killed one of them?

23:17.760 --> 23:20.300
Lot of loose ends here, okay?

23:20.360 --> 23:21.800
So I'm not… hey!

23:21.860 --> 23:24.490
That is why, Claudia,

23:24.490 --> 23:27.130
Taking inventory is so important!

23:27.200 --> 23:29.200
So what are we saying?

23:29.260 --> 23:30.630
What are we saying?

23:30.700 --> 23:33.800
Are we saying that
just Myka's image

23:33.860 --> 23:36.700
Got melded with the
crazy essence of alice?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.530
Yeah, yeah, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.800
Looks like Myka. Isn't Myka.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.100
And if we give voice to that thing,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.160
It'll trick us somehow
to try to get out

23:44.230 --> 23:47.430
And that is not gonna happen.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.130
We've done enough.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.760
We promised each other
we'd stop at $5 million.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.800
I'm a lying, convicted thief, Gary.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.160
I'm breaking the promise.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.300
No, we're so close.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.400
We're just a few thousand away.

24:00.460 --> 24:01.830
It won't make any difference.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.260
You need to see a doctor.

24:03.330 --> 24:05.830
We don't have any insurance.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.330
Please.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.400
We'll be paying out of pocket.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.760
I won't go unless we
offset what that'll cost

24:12.830 --> 24:16.200
With an hour's worth of betting.

24:16.260 --> 24:17.500
Listen to yourself.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.830
You listen.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.800
My hand can rot off.

24:20.860 --> 24:24.800
I'm not going to any doctor.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.100
We should take it now.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.500
Take what?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.860
Whatever it is they've got.

24:28.930 --> 24:31.030
You know, force
them to hand it over.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.400
Well, we're not even sure if…

24:32.460 --> 24:33.180
One more round of betting

24:33.180 --> 24:35.230
And then I'm cashing us out.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.030
Okay. You're the boss.

24:55.730 --> 24:58.160
I was just trying to
keep her distracted.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.760
We're clear.

25:01.830 --> 25:03.860
I want him.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.330
Sorry?

25:05.400 --> 25:06.890
You follow the girl.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.340
I'll stay here

25:07.340 --> 25:08.900
And I'll call you if he comes out.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.260
Are you sure?

25:10.330 --> 25:13.760
Yeah, I can handle
him if there's trouble.

25:13.830 --> 25:16.500
All right. Okay.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.530
I'll, uh…

25:18.600 --> 25:19.830
I'll call you if I catch anything.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.730
Do that.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.830
Artie, I know you're not as sure
about this as you're pretending.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.330
I am not pretending

25:36.400 --> 25:39.820
You know when you hold a 
mirror up to a second mirror

25:39.820 --> 25:42.630
And you get that sort of
reflected infinity thing?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.360
Well, what happens if
that mirror is reflected

25:47.430 --> 25:51.860
And it's something like
the studio 54 disco ball?

25:51.930 --> 25:57.630
Is it possible to get some
kind of artifact interaction?

25:57.700 --> 26:00.730
Something completely unexpected?

26:00.800 --> 26:03.800
I don't know.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.860
What if the disco ball goes off

26:05.930 --> 26:09.660
And someone is standing in
front of the Alice's mirror?

26:09.730 --> 26:11.160
Well, I think we know what happens.

26:11.230 --> 26:14.460
Do we really?

26:14.530 --> 26:15.830
Could reflections switch places?

26:15.900 --> 26:18.360
Could people?

26:18.430 --> 26:22.130
She pulls to the right.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.730
Pardon?

26:23.800 --> 26:25.600
It's something I noticed
a couple months ago.

26:25.660 --> 26:27.220
When Myka's mad at me,

26:27.220 --> 26:29.300
She pulls to the right.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.530
She's mad at you now.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.300
Has been for about a week.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.660
So is she...

26:33.730 --> 26:35.190
Pulling...

26:35.190 --> 26:36.660
To the right?

26:48.360 --> 26:50.160
Red 23!

26:54.830 --> 26:56.060
Excuse me, miss.

26:56.130 --> 26:57.900
Hi. uh, you dropped this.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.060
Keep it.

26:59.130 --> 27:00.100
Maybe you'll get lucky.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.000
That's what I'm hoping.

27:36.830 --> 27:37.760
Red 21!

27:40.360 --> 27:42.200
Holy bananas.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.360
Okay.

27:57.530 --> 27:59.360
Okay.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.260
You're really mad at me.

28:05.330 --> 28:07.130
I feel sorry for you, actually.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.430
Oh, why is that?

28:08.500 --> 28:09.660
Because of all the
things right in front

28:09.730 --> 28:12.000
Of your face that you
simply refuse to see.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.600
Like what?

28:14.660 --> 28:16.430
Like me.

28:16.500 --> 28:22.260
Oh, well.

28:22.330 --> 28:24.400
Yeah, well, I need
to ask you a question

28:24.460 --> 28:26.160
That only the real Myka
would know the answer to.

28:26.230 --> 28:26.530
You know what?

28:26.530 --> 28:27.310
You're wasting time, Artie,

28:27.310 --> 28:28.850
Cause Pete's in danger.

28:29.230 --> 28:30.460
Yeah, well, so are
you, right? In danger

28:30.530 --> 28:34.260
If you're really
who you say you are

28:34.330 --> 28:35.830
Okay.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.760
Okay, fine.

28:38.830 --> 28:40.570
Here's what you and I both know

28:40.570 --> 28:42.700
But we never talk about it.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.160
All right?

28:45.230 --> 28:49.100
That I don't trust you.

28:49.160 --> 28:54.630
That I need you to
tell me the truth...

28:54.700 --> 28:57.730
And to not treat me
like some chess piece

28:57.800 --> 29:01.030
That you move around on a
board that only you can see.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.830
That I am valuable.

29:03.900 --> 29:07.300
That I matter.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.600
And that I deserve
to know everything

29:09.660 --> 29:13.400
I can about this world that
you send me into every day

29:13.460 --> 29:15.760
So at least I have
a fighting chance.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.760
You know, in spite of everything

29:26.930 --> 29:31.430
In spite of everything, I like you.

29:31.500 --> 29:35.330
I think you're great.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.700
And I want you to
think the same of me.

29:57.430 --> 29:59.260
I screwed up.

30:12.930 --> 30:16.100
Honey, my key's not working.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.630
Where's him?

30:24.700 --> 30:27.730
Uh, him's not here.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.000
What were you looking for?

30:29.060 --> 30:31.230
My room.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.630
Who are you?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.260
You're cute.

30:34.330 --> 30:35.900
You're faking it.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.330
Never con a con artist.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.760
You had your chance to walk away.

30:47.830 --> 30:49.700
You won't get another.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.480
Uh, Pete with you?

31:02.550 --> 31:04.280
No, listen. I'm a bit busy.

31:04.350 --> 31:05.450
Can I call you back?

31:05.520 --> 31:07.220
Yeah, no, sure. Everything okay?

31:07.280 --> 31:09.420
It will be as soon as
I can get back to work.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.650
Oh, okay, yeah.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.020
Oh, I got some bad news.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.180
Leena tells me that
your ferret escaped

31:15.250 --> 31:16.520
And she's been
trying to call for it.

31:16.580 --> 31:17.780
She doesn't know its name.

31:17.850 --> 31:19.080
I don't even know if you finally

31:19.150 --> 31:20.420
Did name that thing, did you?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.480
No. No, actually, I never did.

31:22.550 --> 31:24.380
Just put some food out
and it'll come back.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.280
I got to go.

31:32.180 --> 31:36.280
Now...where were we?

31:37.870 --> 31:39.070
Myka did name the ferret.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.710
She's just not
telling Pete the name.

31:40.770 --> 31:41.710
Why not?

31:41.770 --> 31:43.070
Cause she named it pete.

31:43.140 --> 31:44.510
Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.810
Oh, that's good.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.010
- I like that. 
- You think that's funny, huh?

31:48.070 --> 31:50.810
Because if she thinks
we know, she'll kill him.

31:54.610 --> 31:57.570
Jillian, hi

31:57.640 --> 31:59.440
Name's pete.

31:59.510 --> 32:02.670
Look, you're in trouble
and I'm here to help.

32:02.770 --> 32:05.340
That chip that you have, the
one that's changed your luck

32:06.610 --> 32:08.470
Let go or I'll scream.

32:08.540 --> 32:09.640
Jillian, it's hurting you.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.810
That is a contact wound.

32:11.870 --> 32:13.270
Wishing objects do that.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.070
This one seems to
be a bit addictive

32:15.140 --> 32:17.910
And we both know that
that's bad, right?

32:17.970 --> 32:20.670
So you keep the money,
but you give me the chip.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.140
No.

32:22.210 --> 32:24.840
Gary's sick too, isn't he?

32:24.910 --> 32:27.810
You got to stop while
you're ahead, Jillian.

32:27.870 --> 32:29.770
Trust me.

32:29.840 --> 32:34.570
Don't make me use this.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.410
The Jubilee grand, right?

32:36.470 --> 32:38.270
The fire?

32:42.110 --> 32:43.510
What are you gonna do with it?

32:43.570 --> 32:48.510
I am gonna put this on a
shelf and ignore it forever.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.610
I know. Now watch.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.540
Watch what?

33:02.610 --> 33:05.370
That chip allows you
to see the future.

33:17.670 --> 33:20.940
Yeah, I can see the attraction.

33:21.010 --> 33:25.370
You have to tell me
what's going on, Artie.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.140
Well, he may have
figured it out already.

33:27.210 --> 33:28.510
Seriously?

33:28.570 --> 33:29.740
I mean, it's pete
we're talking about.

33:29.810 --> 33:31.340
I can't get ahold of him.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.810
His cell keeps going to voice mail.

33:33.870 --> 33:35.710
Alice has obviously
got the Farnsworth.

33:35.770 --> 33:38.870
Dude, he's in a big hotel.

33:41.110 --> 33:42.640
There was this man
at the bar one night

33:42.740 --> 33:46.940
Bragging about how he
miraculously survived the inferno.

33:47.010 --> 33:49.810
He said that this
chip saved his life.

33:49.870 --> 33:50.970
And you stole it?

33:51.040 --> 33:52.470
It's what we do.

33:52.540 --> 33:54.740
Pete Lattimer, white
courtesy telephone.

33:54.810 --> 33:58.240
Jillian, take the money
and run, don't walk.

33:58.310 --> 33:59.740
Find a beach. Never look back.

33:59.810 --> 34:01.110
I am gonna go get your husband.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.510
Wait, hold on.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.540
You're not arresting
us? You're letting us go?

34:04.610 --> 34:06.040
What happened in Vegas, ok?

34:06.110 --> 34:08.340
Just get out of here.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.170
It looks like you
were telling the truth.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.110
Don't hurt Jillian.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.070
Oh, Gary.

34:20.139 --> 34:21.570
Do you know what?

34:21.639 --> 34:24.840
Hurting is half the fun.

34:24.909 --> 34:26.610
You want to know what's more fun?

34:26.670 --> 34:28.540
The other half.

34:32.110 --> 34:33.909
Who are you?

34:33.969 --> 34:38.639
You've had your wishes, Gary.

34:40.840 --> 34:45.320
Now is my turn.

34:46.739 --> 34:51.230
And now I'll know when
they're coming for me.

34:51.870 --> 34:54.909
And if I can see
them, I can kill them.

35:04.610 --> 35:07.370
I bet you didn't see that coming.

35:10.470 --> 35:14.510
Are you okay?

35:16.410 --> 35:20.510
I'm fine.

35:20.570 --> 35:22.410
I had to use the tesla.

35:34.010 --> 35:35.840
He's dead.

35:39.210 --> 35:43.840
You killed him.

35:43.910 --> 35:45.270
Pete, what's going on?

35:45.340 --> 35:46.310
Change of plans.

35:46.370 --> 35:47.540
Pete?

35:47.610 --> 35:49.370
What do you think, I'm an idiot?

35:49.440 --> 35:50.770
Don't answer that.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.810
Look, just stop, okay?

35:52.870 --> 35:55.370
Just put down the gun

35:55.440 --> 35:56.770
And let's think this through.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
Oh, okay.

35:57.910 --> 35:59.170
Uh, guess what.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.010
I'm still taking the artifact.

36:01.070 --> 36:02.310
I can't let you do that, Pete.

36:02.370 --> 36:05.470
Die trying to stop me, Alice.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.170
Oh, clever boy.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.570
What tipped you?

36:12.640 --> 36:15.010
The real Myka...

36:15.070 --> 36:17.570
Would never kiss me.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.570
Never!

36:19.640 --> 36:23.370
Not if her life depended on it.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.370
- Which is... 
- A shame.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.470
You're a good kisser.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.110
So Artie hasn't
figured this out yet?

36:31.170 --> 36:32.540
Well, not yet.

36:32.610 --> 36:34.810
But when he does, he'll
set the real Myka free,

36:34.870 --> 36:39.270
And you will...poof...disappear.

36:39.340 --> 36:41.340
It doesn't work that way, Pete.

36:41.410 --> 36:43.110
Meaning what?

36:43.170 --> 36:48.640
Meaning nothing comes out of the
mirror unless something goes back in.

36:48.710 --> 36:50.510
Really?

36:50.570 --> 36:54.910
And I am done with that.

36:54.970 --> 36:59.770
Oh, well, I beg to freaking differ.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.470
Freak.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.570
I suppose I should have destroyed
that mirror when I had the chance.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.310
Turn around.

37:06.370 --> 37:08.670
This is on you.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.810
You're the one who set me free.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.210
Oh, yeah?

37:12.270 --> 37:13.910
Well, I'm fixing that right now.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.810
Turn around.

37:20.070 --> 37:21.410
Oh, my...

37:37.870 --> 37:41.110
I am never going
back into that mirror.

37:41.170 --> 37:44.310
Do you hear me?

37:44.370 --> 37:46.240
Never.

37:55.810 --> 37:58.070
And this.

37:58.140 --> 38:00.010
This is my ace.

38:16.440 --> 38:17.640
That's it.

38:17.710 --> 38:20.540
Cash me out.

39:11.490 --> 39:13.690
Curiouser and curiouser.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.120
Pete!

40:50.790 --> 40:52.520
Artie, now!

41:24.860 --> 41:27.560
Hey, Pete, help me.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.560
Artie, where is Myka?

41:56.920 --> 41:57.960
Thank you.

41:58.020 --> 42:01.220
Yeah, you're welcome.

42:01.290 --> 42:02.520
All right.

42:02.590 --> 42:03.920
Okay, here, let's get this.

42:03.990 --> 42:05.120
So what now?

42:05.190 --> 42:06.320
Now...

42:06.390 --> 42:08.420
Now we move Alice
to the Dark Vault.

42:08.490 --> 42:09.890
What's the Dark Vault?

42:09.960 --> 42:11.390
Well, it's better
than the "Oy Gevalt."

42:13.460 --> 42:14.790
Yeah, no, the Dark Vault

42:14.860 --> 42:16.090
You've never seen the Dark Vault.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.520
Yeah, I'm gonna hazard a guess here

42:17.590 --> 42:19.990
You're never gonna want
to see the dark vault

42:19.990 --> 42:22.160
After we move that to there.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.160
Okay, you get the...
no, you know what?

42:24.220 --> 42:26.060
Let's do this tomorrow. okay?

42:26.120 --> 42:28.260
You know, we better secure it.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.860
You know, let's move that trunk.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.860
When I say "let's," I mean you.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.060
Little known but
apropos fact, by the way,

42:34.120 --> 42:36.720
Steven Rubell, who was one of
the co-founders of studio 54,

42:36.790 --> 42:40.320
He considered calling
his club wonderland.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.520
Oh, my god!

42:46.560 --> 42:47.890
Other side.

42:47.960 --> 42:48.920
Hey, lady!

42:50.410 --> 42:51.280
Okay, let's go.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.400
Hey,ey, my ten grand?

42:53.400 --> 42:54.340
Right,about that.

42:54.390 --> 42:55.710
Well, Artie,you know,

42:56.050 --> 42:58.740
Last-minute Apache
helicopter rides

42:58.850 --> 42:59.880
To the middle of
nowhere, south dakota,

43:00.040 --> 43:01.020
Don't come cheap.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.350
Okay, I know a guy with a Chinook.

43:02.410 --> 43:04.730
Would have cost you about half
if you would have called me!

43:04.840 --> 43:06.270
Well, I had to beat
Alice, didn't I?

43:07.730 --> 43:08.890
What's going on, did
it work? Did it work?

43:09.000 --> 43:09.850
Look who's here.

43:09.970 --> 43:10.790
Oh my God

43:12.610 --> 43:14.190
Come on.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.710
Alice uh... Myka, she
said I was a good kisser.

43:17.710 --> 43:18.210
What?
