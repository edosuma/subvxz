WEBVTT

00:57.018 --> 01:01.396
Look. - Rain in the desert?

01:01.690 --> 01:07.562
At home, it rains quite enough. - I hope the camera will take.

01:07.779 --> 01:12.276
Nice. Run the mud. - Let's go home. It looks bad.

01:12.493 --> 01:17.653
A little water. What's the harm? - Let's go now.

01:32.972 --> 01:36.305
Stop by, David. Be nice.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.817
Oh, my God. Is it right?

01:47.028 --> 01:51.275
It comes towards us. - Drive!

01:51.490 --> 01:53.732
Let's get out.

01:55.286 --> 01:58.073
David, please. - Let's get out.

01:59.373 --> 02:02.125
Hurry!

02:19.060 --> 02:20.720
David!

02:24.357 --> 02:26.101
David!

02:51.843 --> 02:55.177
SAHARA DESERT DAY: 5

02:57.224 --> 02:59.217
Send all.

02:59.435 --> 03:03.053
I no longer want to come here. - We did not come here at all.

03:03.230 --> 03:07.275
It sends us back and says that is the wrong direction.

03:07.484 --> 03:11.981
I will send GPS information and images. They are forced to believe in us.

03:12.197 --> 03:15.898
I'll send it now.

03:16.118 --> 03:20.412
Ready. - Now let's get out.

03:20.623 --> 03:23.196
Take us home.

03:25.836 --> 03:32.041
There is poor visibility. I fly low.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.510
What's going on?

03:36.597 --> 03:39.267
Step.

03:45.148 --> 03:47.935
Hunley Marine Institute

03:48.151 --> 03:50.060
KALLIOVUORET, Colorado

04:12.634 --> 04:15.042
Thank you.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.292
Now, do not play with.

04:55.469 --> 05:00.215
When stressed it fits you perfectly.

05:00.349 --> 05:04.347
Come on. - Changes are almost ready.

05:04.562 --> 05:12.023
Do not have 15 minutes to his partner? Tragic.

05:12.236 --> 05:18.191
15 minutes, no more. - Yes, I lieutenant.

05:41.433 --> 05:44.102
Tule. - Reminds me menemme?

05:44.310 --> 05:48.178
Soon you will see. It is a surprise.

05:48.398 --> 05:55.279
Do I have yet to climb? - Yes. Come on, old man.

06:13.548 --> 06:17.712
Some couples say this treffeiksi.

06:18.011 --> 06:22.389
It's been a long time, when we ate together. We are always in a hurry.

06:22.599 --> 06:28.768
You always work on the turbine working and I'm in the lab.

06:29.064 --> 06:35.399
It is important to be together, especially now that ...

06:35.613 --> 06:40.073
John. - Look.

06:46.374 --> 06:48.580
Not.

06:52.588 --> 06:57.167
It's too early. It was supposed to happen in a week.

07:00.054 --> 07:04.681
It may not be our storm. - Nothing else is not moving as quickly.

07:04.976 --> 07:08.594
We need to go to the conference room.

07:19.157 --> 07:22.941
As you know, this is the first part of the destruction.

07:23.161 --> 07:27.740
This is Central Africa. The desert has become a lake.

07:28.041 --> 07:33.332
The storm began in the North of Egypt, and it is already here up.

07:33.505 --> 07:39.341
Now it rains normally, but a storm in the middle of a bad situation.

07:39.511 --> 07:42.216
Rain of 50 mm per hour.

07:42.430 --> 07:46.049
The storm force here was supposed to last two weeks.

07:46.268 --> 07:50.645
It becomes more powerful, immensely. - It is true, Dr. Nichols.

07:50.856 --> 07:57.819
It becomes stronger 320 km in every direction, and is not known to subside.

07:58.113 --> 08:05.658
According to calculations, it covers the entire planet in five weeks.

08:10.376 --> 08:15.121
Corporal, I need a storm in the last coordinates.

08:16.715 --> 08:19.800
They are given here.

08:20.094 --> 08:23.545
Please, sir.

08:31.939 --> 08:36.850
Will we choose to work in the sheet 35 working days?

08:37.153 --> 08:42.491
We would like to thank the fleet that we were not even advance warning.

08:42.616 --> 08:44.526
How far you've come?

08:44.702 --> 08:49.448
The outer shell, interior and propellers are still outstanding.

08:49.624 --> 08:55.128
And turbines. - Design to prepare for aamulla.

09:04.848 --> 09:07.849
How far you have come with the collection of DNA?

09:08.143 --> 09:11.097
They are not here. I have a seed stocks.

09:11.312 --> 09:17.433
DNA samples are in Denver, as the Cooling system does not yet exist.

09:17.611 --> 09:21.560
It is the most important thing of all, that ye shall receive them here.

09:21.740 --> 09:27.909
The second sheet of builders expect tracings.

09:28.205 --> 09:33.745
They do not even have a prototype. - Others do not have time to be completed on time.

09:34.795 --> 09:40.714
Shall amend the Plan. Since time is limited, -

09:40.926 --> 09:45.671
our arkkimme is probably the only one that will be completed in a timely manner.

09:45.889 --> 09:50.847
Is not 90 per cent of their passengers sheets clear any of this?

09:51.145 --> 09:54.596
Passengers are brought together and the seats will be.

09:54.732 --> 09:58.101
Of these, 300 will be flown here.

09:58.319 --> 10:03.146
Families have been promised places. After all, they still have places?

10:03.365 --> 10:05.856
My parents and your mother.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.944
The situation has changed. Your family will be flown here.

10:10.247 --> 10:14.625
But not all of them survive.

10:14.752 --> 10:19.295
What people have said? - That it is now a powerful storm season.

10:19.507 --> 10:23.635
Admiral. - Tell me, Lieutenant.

10:23.761 --> 10:28.222
Center of the storm is less than 640 km from the east coast.

10:28.433 --> 10:31.967
It does not match calculations.

10:32.270 --> 10:37.940
It covers the earth in less than three weeks. Schedule is becoming more difficult.

10:38.234 --> 10:40.986
Get back to work.

10:41.279 --> 10:46.700
I know that the turbine plan is impossible, but I have to try.

10:46.910 --> 10:50.658
Personally, I have my orders. - After all, you have a conscience, sir?

10:50.872 --> 10:55.664
I'll send it, but within 24 hours the earth is covered by water.

10:55.794 --> 11:00.290
I've done my part. Now it's your turn.

11:12.853 --> 11:14.929
EVACUATION ROUTE

11:18.900 --> 11:23.064
FLORIDA KEYS, FLORIDA DAY: SEVEN

11:25.240 --> 11:31.742
Hey. Let us over the bridge. - The bridge is closed during the storm.

11:31.955 --> 11:35.704
The house needs to be protected. - Here it is dangerous.

11:35.918 --> 11:39.501
Everywhere is dangerous. The water rises all the time.

11:39.713 --> 11:43.960
The island is covered item under the water. - What are you doing?

11:44.260 --> 11:47.878
Saving our lives.

11:48.097 --> 11:54.716
No! This is sick. - Why do all of the following us?

12:00.693 --> 12:02.935
Faster!

12:23.424 --> 12:27.837
ROCK MOUNTAINS, COLORADO DATE: NINE

12:32.559 --> 12:36.936
Check that the DNA samples are undamaged.

13:06.927 --> 13:08.801
Tri Nichols.

13:08.929 --> 13:14.089
Locomotive Man called. The train does not run due to the earthquake.

13:14.393 --> 13:18.521
Where is it? - 60 km south-east of here.

13:18.731 --> 13:23.808
Rebecca. - The samples are cold store.

13:23.986 --> 13:29.443
They melt in a few hours and go bad.

13:29.658 --> 13:34.404
See the copter and the staff are ready and call the Masters.

13:34.622 --> 13:37.955
What do you do? - Someone has to retrieve the samples.

13:38.167 --> 13:42.544
The Masters is one of the best soldiers. He knows how to handle the task.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.005
And part.

13:46.217 --> 13:52.836
The train has more than 100,000 samples, and do not fit into the chopper.

13:53.015 --> 13:58.852
All is not mandatory, but the applicant will need to know what are.

13:59.063 --> 14:03.191
He did not know what to yöperhos- samples are needed -

14:03.484 --> 14:07.352
in order to create a new permanent ecosystem.

14:07.572 --> 14:10.193
I can not afford to lose you.

14:10.492 --> 14:14.869
Get samples and come back. Do you understand?

14:15.038 --> 14:17.244
Right.

14:32.639 --> 14:37.882
Masters, this is Dr. Tessa Nichols.

14:39.688 --> 14:45.192
The train has DNA samples. The train does not run due to the earthquake.

14:45.485 --> 14:50.444
Dr. Nichols goes to the train. Help him to take the samples.

14:50.657 --> 14:54.821
They and the woman must be safely back.

14:54.953 --> 14:57.527
Get back as soon as possible.

14:57.748 --> 15:04.960
The forward speed of the storm in mind, 30 minutes can be a chaos.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.797
Good luck.

15:06.966 --> 15:10.548
Tessa.

15:12.054 --> 15:14.759
I look forward to the helicopter's house.

15:14.974 --> 15:17.216
What are you doing here?

15:17.518 --> 15:21.812
Train with DNA samples does not pass. I have to fly there.

15:21.981 --> 15:25.979
Can not they send someone else there? - I'll get by, John.

15:28.487 --> 15:33.944
Be careful. We're gonna survive ... each one.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.738
Of course.

15:35.953 --> 15:38.990
I love you. - And you.

15:55.348 --> 15:58.219
Get the goods from the office.

15:58.518 --> 16:02.646
Get ready to go when I come back.

16:41.395 --> 16:43.103
To.

16:43.314 --> 16:47.607
Hello, my dear. I am here.

16:49.612 --> 16:56.030
How soon can you get to St. Louis? They draw to decide the ark pääsijät.

16:56.160 --> 17:00.905
Pack your bags and go to St. Louis.

17:01.082 --> 17:07.166
Why? - Storms are not normal.

17:07.380 --> 17:13.299
They do not stop. They are biblical class.

17:14.345 --> 17:20.964
Source immediately. Do not tell anyone. - Okay.

17:21.102 --> 17:24.803
I love you.

17:29.736 --> 17:34.279
What's going on? Who was it? - Chase.

17:34.491 --> 17:37.824
What has he done now?

17:38.036 --> 17:44.074
He said that we must go to St. Louis. The storm is not normal.

17:44.250 --> 17:48.747
There are a ship that will save us. We have to go.

17:48.964 --> 17:52.664
The journey takes ten hours. - We are safe here.

17:52.884 --> 17:56.300
I know, but ...

18:00.934 --> 18:04.884
It is time to leave. I'll get the keys. - I'll get Kileyn.

18:10.235 --> 18:14.482
It is forced to leave, Kiley. - We're pretty busy.

18:14.781 --> 18:20.784
The storm intensifies and is forced ... - It's a thunderstorm. Take it easy.

18:20.996 --> 18:23.914
Get out. - Chase said that the premise.

18:24.124 --> 18:28.336
Source and let us be. - Please.

18:28.545 --> 18:33.208
Los, Amanda. Nyt.

18:35.302 --> 18:38.173
Indeed exaggeration.

19:03.915 --> 19:07.284
We do not have time ever in a traffic jam.

19:07.502 --> 19:12.923
Everyone wants out of town. - We can not go anywhere now.

19:14.843 --> 19:19.006
My grandfather was a boat. - Yeah?

19:19.222 --> 19:23.434
We can go to the Morgantowniin and take a ride out there.

19:23.727 --> 19:26.811
Are you crazy? We are trying to get out from under the water.

19:27.022 --> 19:32.360
And now we can not even get out of Pittsburgh.

19:32.569 --> 19:36.317
Where is the port? - Six blocks away.

19:38.533 --> 19:42.198
Damn. Okay.

19:59.263 --> 20:02.466
We are almost at the railroad.

20:12.276 --> 20:14.399
The train is there.

20:35.007 --> 20:37.415
Ready?

20:39.053 --> 20:42.552
Keep the line open.

21:02.494 --> 21:06.326
Do you hear? - Sounds like lightning strikes.

21:13.046 --> 21:15.833
It never stops.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.548
Oh, my God!

21:23.432 --> 21:26.433
The bridge will sink.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.060
Hold on.

21:37.738 --> 21:39.861
What's going on?

22:06.934 --> 22:11.014
Fuel? - 36.2.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.519
36,2.

22:16.777 --> 22:21.356
Dedusted and spreading the seeds. - Is it the contents of the wagon?

22:21.532 --> 22:26.740
Insects are the foundation of human existence.

22:26.996 --> 22:32.583
The honey bee is responsible for one-third part of the human food per year.

22:32.794 --> 22:35.499
The third trailer of insects.

22:35.713 --> 22:39.925
Start the engine. - Why?

22:47.267 --> 22:51.051
Contact the Masters,. They need to get out.

22:51.271 --> 22:54.806
Masters, loppu.
- Tyler.

22:55.066 --> 22:58.767
You have to go away. - Not a good sound.

23:02.157 --> 23:05.905
Run. - We need more time.

23:06.119 --> 23:09.535
We need to get over to the chopper.

23:15.212 --> 23:17.917
Come on! - Come inside.

23:19.007 --> 23:22.922
Can you jump in with the tank? - I do not.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.671
I'm gonna go inside first.

23:33.647 --> 23:37.811
Hold my hand.

23:40.654 --> 23:43.228
No!

23:43.449 --> 23:47.447
We need you. It's not worth it.

23:52.375 --> 23:56.953
Oh, my God.

24:08.558 --> 24:13.848
The Ark is here. Is not it beautiful?

24:14.105 --> 24:17.391
Lieutenant John Travis.

24:17.567 --> 24:22.229
Captain Frank Bridges, Sergeant and Sergeant Oates Hyams.

24:22.447 --> 24:26.527
They guide the sheets. - My assistant Chase Freeman.

24:26.743 --> 24:32.283
You have created a great ship. - Thank you, sir.

24:32.499 --> 24:37.125
How many travel to accommodate? - 50000.

24:37.337 --> 24:41.880
Ohjaako it is this technology? - Yes, sir.

24:42.133 --> 24:46.546
How does it work? - Turbines driven by two energy sources.

24:46.763 --> 24:51.141
Into hydro, when the water passes through the turbines, -

24:51.351 --> 24:55.847
so-called vanes through which are outside of the sheet.

24:56.106 --> 25:02.524
It is not enough-sheet activities. Other sources of energy are needed.

25:02.696 --> 25:08.153
Business. As the waves and then to move the ark to the turbine flotation device -

25:08.368 --> 25:13.161
transfer energy to fuel cells. It and hydro together -

25:13.374 --> 25:19.708
produce electricity system. No fuel, only water and movement.

25:19.922 --> 25:22.413
It does not end before the sheet is on land.

25:22.591 --> 25:29.093
Are the tests were a success? - Hydropower works great.

25:29.306 --> 25:33.553
What floatation device for kinetic energy? - It is currently being tested.

25:33.769 --> 25:37.553
Now it is started.

25:40.026 --> 25:42.813
Going for a few seconds.

25:47.533 --> 25:50.737
It does not seem to belong to the test.

25:50.953 --> 25:54.287
The fuel cell is a problem.

25:54.499 --> 25:58.543
I checked the three times. It should work perfectly.

25:58.711 --> 26:01.997
Can locate the fault? - They have been in the hundreds.

26:02.257 --> 26:06.551
If one fails, the other will go out. It was forced to close.

26:11.766 --> 26:15.811
Can you prepare a new device? - It takes a long time.

26:16.021 --> 26:21.691
That's not acceptable. - I need a new device.

26:21.902 --> 26:26.896
This is a theoretical technology. Where you will find a new device?

26:27.157 --> 26:32.531
The device is not used in this way ever before.

26:32.704 --> 26:36.405
But the components have been used for many years buoys.

26:36.625 --> 26:40.373
Where will you find a buoy, Lieutenant?

26:40.587 --> 26:45.545
Illinois. Joliet is a shipping company, where they have been.

26:45.717 --> 26:49.418
Can you transfer the necessary part? - Yes, sir.

26:50.597 --> 26:56.434
This is a secret mission. They may not know why you're here.

26:56.645 --> 26:59.765
Right. - Amato is included.

26:59.982 --> 27:03.683
Come at once. - Yes, sir.

27:03.903 --> 27:06.987
Thank you.

27:10.701 --> 27:16.325
Lieutenant, there is no room for error.

27:16.540 --> 27:21.962
Right. - I checked everything.

27:22.213 --> 27:26.507
For some reason, I have calculated the wrong.

27:26.717 --> 27:29.754
Rauhoitu.

27:29.971 --> 27:35.890
Locate the problem. Fix it until I get back.

27:36.102 --> 27:38.675
Come on.

27:54.746 --> 28:00.867
How bad is it? - We will not survive.

28:02.462 --> 28:05.297
What do you mean?

28:05.507 --> 28:12.091
At the human race survives only in a few years.

28:13.974 --> 28:16.132
In other words ... - Yes.

28:16.393 --> 28:21.388
Without a larger number of samples in the human race will die.

28:47.675 --> 28:50.545
What is the direction?

28:50.761 --> 28:55.756
8 degrees to the northeast. We'll be there within 30 seconds.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.562
Over there.

29:00.771 --> 29:05.647
JOLIET, ILLINOIS DAY: ELEVEN

29:07.904 --> 29:09.564
Laskeudu.

29:25.630 --> 29:29.129
Down the stairs to the roof.

29:29.384 --> 29:33.547
50 meters to the west, 20 meters to the south. Not more than five minutes.

29:33.763 --> 29:36.966
Right. Ready?

29:42.564 --> 29:44.889
Go to bottom.

30:32.907 --> 30:37.734
How do we get inside? - Wallace took care of the code.

30:44.752 --> 30:47.504
Where are they?

30:49.799 --> 30:53.879
Here it is. Screw device.

31:19.996 --> 31:24.658
What? - We can not do anything about it. Come on now.

31:37.305 --> 31:41.350
Top is another code.

31:56.825 --> 32:00.905
What did you do? - Improvise.

32:33.905 --> 32:38.982
What are you doing here? - I'm sorry, son.

32:40.411 --> 32:43.198
Come on.

32:48.586 --> 32:52.169
Not quite accurate, but it was successful.

32:52.382 --> 32:54.955
Perhaps. - Maybe?

33:20.660 --> 33:24.030
The boat was better. - I will not go back.

33:24.206 --> 33:27.871
We need to find a car. Continue searching.

33:28.085 --> 33:32.035
What was that? - The sinkhole. Run!

33:50.149 --> 33:54.063
David. Apua!

33:54.236 --> 33:59.112
Apua, David!

33:59.325 --> 34:03.192
David. - Vauhti.

34:03.412 --> 34:07.280
Take hold of.

34:07.500 --> 34:12.328
Come on now. Come on.

34:12.547 --> 34:17.125
We have to get out of here. - This is truly the world.

34:17.342 --> 34:21.969
Do not think that way. We have to get out of here.

34:23.141 --> 34:26.306
Is everything all right? - Does it look like?

34:26.518 --> 34:29.971
We need to get to St. Louis. - What is it?

34:30.148 --> 34:33.232
A large ship, which can save us.

34:33.443 --> 34:39.980
We will help you if you help us. - If my family gets by.

34:42.786 --> 34:45.489
Okay. - Come on, then.

34:55.882 --> 34:58.208
Who are these all are?

34:58.427 --> 35:04.547
Morgantownissa are all my family. They are still here.

35:04.808 --> 35:08.509
The ship is best to be big. - I hope.

35:08.770 --> 35:11.096
Now, let's go.

35:33.254 --> 35:36.836
Admiral. - What happened?

35:37.049 --> 35:40.798
We did not get everything. - What happened, the Masters?

35:41.011 --> 35:44.215
When we collected the samples, was struck by a tornado.

35:44.432 --> 35:47.717
We had time to collect everything that was Dr. Nichol list.

35:47.935 --> 35:52.099
What you got with you? - A few important species is lacking.

35:52.273 --> 35:56.769
What? - Mushrooms and spores.

35:56.986 --> 35:59.691
And single-celled organisms.

35:59.906 --> 36:02.990
What are the most important? - Insects.

36:03.201 --> 36:08.824
Did you get the honey bees? - They were in the container that fell.

36:09.040 --> 36:13.501
Are they important to the project? - They pollinate the plants.

36:13.753 --> 36:20.041
Plants that we and the animals we eat. We can survive, -

36:20.260 --> 36:24.044
but we can not grow crops, which are sufficient for all.

36:24.264 --> 36:29.175
Can we get more of them? - We do not. The train was the only place.

36:29.352 --> 36:33.220
The only option is to go to bee habitat.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.817
It is raining over 1.5 weeks.

36:38.028 --> 36:42.571
What about caves? - They may have been looking for shelter.

36:42.824 --> 36:45.398
If they are in high places.

36:45.619 --> 36:49.664
How we work? - There is a search for caves in the mountains.

36:49.915 --> 36:53.414
It is used in thermal imaging camera that detects the flocks.

36:53.627 --> 36:57.874
Everything you need can be found in the paper.

36:58.090 --> 37:01.625
The helicopter does not work in a storm.

37:01.885 --> 37:05.930
We need an airplane. It can be found in Colorado Springs.

37:06.140 --> 37:10.007
We can go there and search for the helicopter on the way to the north.

37:10.227 --> 37:15.518
How long does it take? You have two days left.

37:15.733 --> 37:22.103
I can not think of schedules. The air samples do not survive.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.861
Going back to the issue when they are with us.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.527
Colorado Hills lost contact.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.660
Permission to write to you, if you come on duty.

37:32.917 --> 37:37.246
Outreach tools. Be the air hours.

37:37.421 --> 37:41.550
I have to ensure cooling of the samples first.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.546
I can do it.

37:44.762 --> 37:50.302
John wonders why I left again.

37:50.518 --> 37:55.014
I'll talk with him. - Thank you, sir.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.961
We have a problem.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.720
Do not come any closer. - Let us in.

38:26.972 --> 38:31.183
It's not safe. - We know what is happening.

38:31.393 --> 38:37.478
We do not know what you are talking about. - Her boyfriend is at work in Colorado.

38:37.691 --> 38:42.270
He told the ark and the value of the pin. We want that.

38:42.446 --> 38:45.316
Flag Headquarters.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.946
I do not care about you.

38:48.911 --> 38:52.362
Take it easy!

38:52.581 --> 38:56.709
Check it out!

39:00.422 --> 39:03.044
Run!

39:07.596 --> 39:09.554
Come on!

39:32.163 --> 39:34.405
Quickly!

39:37.335 --> 39:39.660
Hurry!

39:42.215 --> 39:44.172
Amanda!

40:02.068 --> 40:05.437
DAY: 14

40:07.991 --> 40:12.404
I liked the rain. It was reassuring.

40:12.579 --> 40:16.328
Let's see you agree with the six month's time.

40:16.500 --> 40:21.458
Six months from now is the perfect monsoon season.

40:21.672 --> 40:26.085
You need to rest. You do not know what you're talking about.

40:26.301 --> 40:30.513
I thought that when you came out you site.

40:30.723 --> 40:36.843
Participation in the project is important, but there are others involved.

40:38.522 --> 40:43.683
I have the main responsibility, and I can not be everywhere.

40:43.903 --> 40:48.612
I am assuming that you have heard of Tessa. - Yes.

40:53.245 --> 40:56.697
Have you managed to repair the device?

40:56.916 --> 41:02.622
It was easier than expected, but we made major changes.

41:02.839 --> 41:06.373
Does it work? - We had to improvise.

41:06.551 --> 41:10.383
But it works for sure.

41:10.555 --> 41:16.427
It is mandatory. When the turbines are on the high seas and the sheet tilts -

41:16.603 --> 41:21.763
and face waves below. When to do a new test?

41:23.067 --> 41:28.691
In the morning. - Excellent.

41:32.285 --> 41:36.117
Listen, John. I had to put her there.

41:36.331 --> 41:40.495
He was the only one that can handle the task.

42:07.029 --> 42:11.109
DAY: 16

42:12.409 --> 42:15.944
What do you think? - Worth a try.

42:16.205 --> 42:21.709
Valley was flooded orchard. It means the bees.

42:21.919 --> 42:26.296
What do you think of the waterfall? - It forms the lakes in the mountains.

42:26.507 --> 42:33.388
Water Pressure due to the areas may sink, but it can be successful.

43:01.709 --> 43:06.621
What do you think? - I do not know.

43:22.522 --> 43:24.894
Come on in.

43:25.108 --> 43:31.526
You did a great job. Mr. Travis managed to get in and out.

43:31.698 --> 43:36.609
No one is dead. Oh, great. - Thank you, sir.

43:36.787 --> 43:41.247
If humanity survives alive, it is to your credit.

43:41.458 --> 43:46.204
No, it's yours.

43:46.421 --> 43:51.796
What's going on? - St. Louis.

43:53.345 --> 43:56.512
Internal communication at the sheet.

43:56.724 --> 44:01.184
The commander sent it at the same time gave the alarm.

44:01.395 --> 44:06.769
What else have you heard? - We can not contact them anymore.

44:06.984 --> 44:11.942
Denver is the only place where we can get the connection.

44:12.156 --> 44:19.404
This has given the penalty. Is the culprit identified?

44:19.622 --> 44:23.406
Anna soul.

44:44.772 --> 44:51.356
This part seems to be uncertain. - We're the lake below.

44:59.329 --> 45:05.533
Location must be dry, if the bees are here.

45:05.752 --> 45:09.370
There are not many choices.

45:09.589 --> 45:11.582
I know.

45:27.441 --> 45:31.355
We found it!

45:31.570 --> 45:35.899
How do we get there? - I do not know.

45:36.116 --> 45:39.948
I have to climb.

45:41.455 --> 45:44.990
Be careful. - Absolutely.

45:49.130 --> 45:53.792
Earthquake? - No. It belonged to the upper side.

46:00.182 --> 46:03.598
Ceiling deceiving. Run!

46:12.028 --> 46:14.780
Let's get out.

46:18.660 --> 46:20.783
Come on.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.505
Come on, Tyler.

46:39.681 --> 46:42.089
Tyler!

46:44.477 --> 46:46.137
No!

46:49.691 --> 46:51.767
We need to go away.

46:51.943 --> 46:55.727
Can you fly like this?

46:55.906 --> 46:59.606
Let's find out.

47:04.498 --> 47:06.870
Hold on.

47:16.844 --> 47:19.465
Is everything all right?

47:19.680 --> 47:23.547
Tyler and Welker are gone. What was the benefit?

47:23.767 --> 47:28.762
Without honey bees do not have any hope.

48:07.478 --> 48:11.642
Hei, Freeman.
- Amiraali.

48:11.858 --> 48:17.564
Is everything all right? - Come on.

48:19.240 --> 48:22.574
You have spoken girlfriend, Amanda, with -

48:22.786 --> 48:26.534
sheet in St. Louis, is not it?

48:26.748 --> 48:32.335
He took with him 1,000 people who require access to that.

48:32.587 --> 48:35.754
I have no family and all other ...

48:35.966 --> 48:39.132
The place has been destroyed.

48:39.344 --> 48:45.098
You have your people are gone, like ours. Of deaths each and every.

48:45.309 --> 48:48.144
Be glad that I did not shoot you.

48:48.353 --> 48:52.647
Take this. - What is it?

48:52.858 --> 48:59.525
You will receive an opportunity like everyone else. It's almost too much.

49:00.908 --> 49:02.568
Ota se.

49:09.959 --> 49:14.537
Can I talk to?

50:07.392 --> 50:11.853
We need to talk. - What is it?

50:12.063 --> 50:17.438
You're not going to like this. - What?

50:17.694 --> 50:21.774
Hunley is a helicopter platform, but not the runway.

50:21.990 --> 50:25.739
Radio does not work and the fuel is exhausted.

50:25.953 --> 50:30.449
If we find in Denver, we can keep the course towards the Hunley.

50:30.707 --> 50:33.080
Everything else is too risky.

50:33.252 --> 50:36.870
You can find a place, but you can not descend, so ...

50:39.007 --> 50:43.468
Not. - There is no alternative.

50:43.721 --> 50:49.474
We do not jump to the machine. - Let's do a tandem low.

50:49.727 --> 50:54.270
It could work. I've done it before.

50:55.316 --> 50:58.103
You have two options:

50:58.319 --> 51:03.313
Do you want to jump or die?

51:10.081 --> 51:12.369
Oh, my God.

51:14.669 --> 51:17.456
I found Denver.

51:26.848 --> 51:34.096
Wait a minute. If Denver is flooded ... - All is covered with water.

51:56.086 --> 52:00.463
Ready? - Yes, sir.

52:00.715 --> 52:03.835
Begin. - We look forward to Free Mania.

52:04.052 --> 52:07.338
Action, Lieutenant.

52:08.265 --> 52:12.263
Activate the device.

52:12.477 --> 52:18.598
The generator is running and the turbines are loaded. It works.

52:18.859 --> 52:22.193
Hopefully this will continue. What else should I do?

52:22.362 --> 52:27.274
Turbines must be installed in the ark.

52:27.493 --> 52:31.704
I am ready, Maggie kun is ready. - Oletteko you?

52:31.914 --> 52:35.746
We work with the turbines and the body working.

52:35.960 --> 52:40.254
End in sight, but there is still much to do.

52:40.464 --> 52:44.711
How many days? - Six, seven.

52:44.927 --> 52:49.139
We do not have so many days. Increase the pace of work.

52:49.307 --> 52:55.641
Sir. Have you heard any of Tessa? - I do not.

52:57.023 --> 53:01.601
It's been several days. - I understand that you are concerned.

53:01.861 --> 53:04.317
Dr. Nichols is in good hands.

53:04.530 --> 53:10.236
Do not let your emotions influence. It can have devastating consequences.

53:11.537 --> 53:14.242
Continue.

53:35.854 --> 53:39.139
We have 3000 meters of altitude.

53:40.984 --> 53:45.397
I open the shadow of 450 meters. If I do it in the past -

53:45.614 --> 53:48.484
we can run into the mountain.

53:51.870 --> 53:56.164
The descent takes a minute. Ready?

53:56.333 --> 53:59.832
Ask me later.

54:00.045 --> 54:02.417
One, two, three.

54:30.910 --> 54:34.160
How does it look? - Turbines is attached.

54:34.372 --> 54:38.832
The switches are half-finished. Help speed up the work. Where Freeman is?

54:39.043 --> 54:43.420
Freeman is on holidays. - What do you mean?

54:43.631 --> 54:49.005
He juorusi sheet, which is in St. Louis. It has now been destroyed.

54:49.220 --> 54:51.047
Where is he now?

54:51.264 --> 54:55.392
Denver, waiting for the lottery results.

54:55.602 --> 54:59.386
It is murder. - It was a gracious.

54:59.606 --> 55:02.856
Ask your workmate.

55:05.153 --> 55:08.070
Maddie?

55:09.324 --> 55:10.783
Maddie?

55:16.581 --> 55:21.208
My family was sent to St. Louis.

55:23.588 --> 55:27.669
My parents and my brother were there.

55:44.276 --> 55:49.519
Did we get it right? - Yeah.

56:01.544 --> 56:06.336
How far are we from? - Up to 5 kilometers.

56:06.507 --> 56:09.841
Good evening, ladies. Where are you going?

56:10.094 --> 56:14.222
You have to let us go. - Okay.

56:14.432 --> 56:17.433
Or you can socialize with us.

56:17.602 --> 56:21.813
Forget about it. - It was not a suggestion.

56:24.108 --> 56:29.648
Wrong choice, honey. - Point it is seen.

56:36.871 --> 56:40.287
Let's get out.

56:47.382 --> 56:51.960
Who are you? - Most would say thank you.

56:52.178 --> 56:55.014
Thank you.

56:55.223 --> 56:58.260
I'm not like the others. Who are you?

56:58.476 --> 57:03.719
A person who has no place to run. My name is Ralph.

57:03.940 --> 57:09.065
Judging by the uniforms you know how to be going Hunleyhin.

57:09.279 --> 57:13.277
You have certainly good reason for it.

57:13.492 --> 57:16.493
Yes, it is.

57:16.662 --> 57:22.083
Not. I do not take responsibility for any of this to myself.

57:22.292 --> 57:26.835
I'll take. I can tell you what happened.

57:27.089 --> 57:31.003
Come with me. - I have followed.

57:32.261 --> 57:36.590
They can also come by.

57:36.807 --> 57:40.010
Let's go.

57:45.566 --> 57:48.900
DAY: 18

57:53.157 --> 57:55.233
Impressive.

57:59.664 --> 58:05.916
Does it work at sea? - When the panels are installed.

58:06.170 --> 58:10.334
Are the turbines in place? - John connecting cables.

58:16.222 --> 58:21.679
What the hell is this? - Say armed guards.

58:22.770 --> 58:26.555
When I get to know who they are. - Passengers.

58:26.733 --> 58:31.976
Says who? -I'll. They saved us from this.

58:33.281 --> 58:35.855
Onnistuitteko you? - Yes.

58:36.117 --> 58:39.949
Make sure that they get the points.

58:40.205 --> 58:44.618
Come on. - Follow me.

58:49.756 --> 58:53.801
Time is not enough. - Denver is under water.

58:54.011 --> 59:01.176
The water rises up to the mountains and soon become a flood.

59:01.393 --> 59:05.854
First, you change clothes and jäähdytätte samples.

59:06.064 --> 59:08.437
First, I talk with John.

59:08.650 --> 59:12.944
Common-law husband gets the job done. So you too should be done.

59:13.197 --> 59:19.615
If you speed up the schedule, there is an extra moment. Come on.

59:41.809 --> 59:44.596
Is everything all right?

59:47.023 --> 59:50.522
Do you think if I blame this poor nerves?

59:50.693 --> 59:54.311
I'm the last day after. How long are you?

59:54.530 --> 59:58.824
Ten weeks. - You're braver what I could have imagined.

59:59.035 --> 01:00:03.578
Maddie is installed into the ark Cooling system. Come on.

01:01:04.268 --> 01:01:07.719
Where's John? - Run!

01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:18.238
Evacuation alert.

01:01:19.867 --> 01:01:25.372
Start turbines. We're leaving now. - Tessa has not yet come.

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:29.875
Turbines on. Now!

01:01:47.395 --> 01:01:50.396
This way. Come on!

01:01:57.989 --> 01:02:02.984
I can help. - Inside the ark.

01:02:03.203 --> 01:02:05.528
Come on!

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:08.117
John!

01:02:11.169 --> 01:02:13.743
Turbine situation? - Ongoing.

01:02:13.922 --> 01:02:16.674
Area full of water.

01:02:16.842 --> 01:02:21.302
Fuel cells are charging. Turbines are ready to start.

01:02:21.513 --> 01:02:26.389
Start propellers and get ready to go.

01:02:44.036 --> 01:02:46.242
Admiral!

01:02:48.374 --> 01:02:52.751
Admiral!

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.209
He is gone.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.793
The doors are closed.

01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:04.845
How many passengers is it? - About 500.

01:03:07.018 --> 01:03:10.351
Full speed ahead. - The door is closed.

01:03:10.563 --> 01:03:15.770
We did not get it from here open. Let's go straight through. Forward.

01:03:29.249 --> 01:03:32.119
Be prepared for a collision.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.814
Check the water level.

01:04:01.281 --> 01:04:06.524
Approaching the mountains. Water is not yet in height.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:17.671
If the water level does not rise, the sheet is broken into pieces.

01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:21.713
It is durable. We tested all the materials.

01:04:21.927 --> 01:04:24.798
You threw it in the mountains?

01:04:35.858 --> 01:04:41.232
John. - Tessa. Thank God.

01:04:41.489 --> 01:04:47.361
Are you okay? - I ... can we well.

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:51.867
Take the room. - Come on.

01:05:17.192 --> 01:05:23.064
The turbine area is a problem. - How bad is it?

01:05:23.281 --> 01:05:28.489
The body is broken. - It does not hurt anything.

01:05:28.703 --> 01:05:35.240
The inner part is durable. - Only the exterior is broken.

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:40.003
What about turbines? - Turn them on again.

01:05:40.215 --> 01:05:45.126
Does not work. Propellers slowed down and the electrical system is at half capacity.

01:05:45.345 --> 01:05:49.509
Is there another turbine power? - It takes time.

01:05:49.725 --> 01:05:55.063
Electrical system pushes back even then. - So what? There's no rush.

01:05:55.272 --> 01:05:57.941
Some of the waves are enormous.

01:05:58.108 --> 01:06:04.028
Visit badly, if we do not get a second turbine to operate.

01:06:06.659 --> 01:06:11.617
DAY: 21

01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:21.083
The turbine is broken. We do not help it.

01:06:21.298 --> 01:06:27.551
The game is being played. If the power is not enough, the sheet is useless.

01:06:27.763 --> 01:06:32.390
Is used only for essential electrical systems -

01:06:32.643 --> 01:06:36.855
and we're doing a single turbine. We're still alive.

01:06:39.692 --> 01:06:42.230
Kapteeni Bridges haluaa raportin.

01:06:42.445 --> 01:06:46.739
The turbine is broken, but the other is in operation.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:52.620
Propellers on a six-power. The sails are raised, but they are flimsy.

01:06:52.831 --> 01:06:57.825
They do not last. - What do I say to him?

01:06:58.044 --> 01:07:00.998
Turbines are doomed.

01:07:02.257 --> 01:07:05.590
Let's try something else. I need your help.

01:07:05.802 --> 01:07:08.258
Without more.

01:07:16.188 --> 01:07:22.191
Denver is under water. I hope that their sheets were launched.

01:07:26.073 --> 01:07:32.193
Turbines do not work, and the sails are broken. Bad look.

01:07:38.794 --> 01:07:42.874
We are a Denver-sheet case. We do not see it.

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:48.464
I hope it was able to move without the turbines.

01:07:53.184 --> 01:07:58.889
DAY: 23

01:07:59.106 --> 01:08:04.349
What? - The last chance.

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:09.861
Is it a sail? - The material is durable for all.

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:16.242
We have to climb the masts and sails to repair.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:19.707
It is dangerous, but we know how to do the job.

01:08:19.919 --> 01:08:25.424
Who is "we"? - The need for the three men. Volunteers?

01:08:27.468 --> 01:08:30.220
I will do it. - Me too.

01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:35.091
When we are there, let Bridge It brand set sail.

01:08:35.268 --> 01:08:38.684
I'll go first. Enter the sail.

01:08:57.249 --> 01:09:03.702
We have 857 passengers. 35 slightly injured.

01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:10.091
Is the Admiral on board? - No. He did not come aboard.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:33.734
Captain, raise your sails.

01:09:36.663 --> 01:09:39.618
Wind becomes stronger.

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:03.284
Oh, my God.

01:11:06.505 --> 01:11:11.214
What happened? - There is dangerous.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.342
Is he alive? - Barely.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.720
Amato is gone. - And no.

01:11:37.662 --> 01:11:42.489
Captain, Lieutenant Amato died trying to repair the sail.

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:04.313
DAY: 31

01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:17.653
How can he?

01:12:17.869 --> 01:12:21.819
He's in a coma, but the situation has been stable for 24 hours.

01:12:22.082 --> 01:12:25.533
Maddie at her side. How's it going?

01:12:25.752 --> 01:12:31.043
It works great. Electricity is not much, but the job is held.

01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:33.416
Could you come with me?

01:12:33.593 --> 01:12:38.054
Is something? - Come on.

01:12:42.352 --> 01:12:45.935
What's the matter? - Point to see.

01:12:50.444 --> 01:12:56.198
Oh, my God. How are you, Lynn?

01:12:56.408 --> 01:13:00.453
I'm thirsty. Hangover.

01:13:02.164 --> 01:13:05.664
He is dehydration, but he survives.

01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:09.784
You've been asleep a long time.

01:13:10.047 --> 01:13:12.834
Where Amato?

01:13:15.011 --> 01:13:19.554
He does not, unfortunately, survived.

01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:41.486
How does it feel? - Good. Strong.

01:14:01.433 --> 01:14:04.102
Big waves striking towards the front.

01:14:07.814 --> 01:14:09.807
Prepare a collision.

01:14:14.571 --> 01:14:16.813
In front is a barrier.

01:14:20.994 --> 01:14:23.664
Cancel.

01:14:40.306 --> 01:14:42.263
What was it?

01:15:06.457 --> 01:15:08.201
Sounds bad.

01:15:14.674 --> 01:15:17.877
Come on.

01:15:30.815 --> 01:15:34.895
What happened? - Wave forced us down.

01:15:35.153 --> 01:15:41.867
We have two mountain peaks in between. We can not get away.

01:15:43.078 --> 01:15:45.367
What was it?

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:50.788
The impact was hard. Mountain could collapse at any time.

01:15:51.002 --> 01:15:55.914
We were buried here. - We need to get away.

01:15:56.174 --> 01:16:00.504
How does it happen? - Some kind of explosive form.

01:16:00.679 --> 01:16:03.466
We need the accelerator.

01:16:03.682 --> 01:16:07.051
What materials did you use for cooling the samples?

01:16:07.311 --> 01:16:11.889
Ethyl chloride. I have four tanks, each is eight.

01:16:12.107 --> 01:16:14.396
Is it enough? - One is enough.

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:19.402
It is a quarter of the samples. - It is better than destruction.

01:16:19.615 --> 01:16:24.443
I have a little sort.

01:16:24.662 --> 01:16:28.956
I will spare all the most important. - Good.

01:16:35.965 --> 01:16:38.586
Place the screwdriver on top.

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:55.933
The clock is ticking. - In and out.

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:20.861
Has anyone thought about what happens if it works?

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:25.568
Not to think too much. Turn on the cable.

01:19:39.193 --> 01:19:42.110
We are once again on course, sir.

01:19:44.073 --> 01:19:46.445
Oh, great.

01:19:50.496 --> 01:19:54.576
Are we alive? - Probably.

01:19:57.503 --> 01:20:00.374
Now let's get out of here.

01:20:21.861 --> 01:20:26.073
DAY: 40

01:20:34.874 --> 01:20:37.911
The water level has subsided.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.569
Oh, my God.

01:21:11.787 --> 01:21:15.950
Invite staff position.

01:21:22.715 --> 01:21:26.214
What is it, Captain?

01:21:30.014 --> 01:21:34.391
I have never seen anything more beautiful.

01:21:40.941 --> 01:21:45.319
Sheet 1, the end. - Captain Bridges. Who's there?

01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:50.814
Freeman. Te selvisitte.

01:21:51.869 --> 01:21:54.989
Where are you? - Denver-sheet.

01:21:55.164 --> 01:21:58.948
We have other sheets in the company of Kansas.

01:21:59.127 --> 01:22:04.002
Blowing Rockin, Los Alamosin,
Minneapolisin arkit...

01:22:04.215 --> 01:22:07.999
My parents and your mother.

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:14.015
Admiral Wallace got the drawings there.

01:22:14.225 --> 01:22:19.386
Who else survived? - Is Maddie's there?

01:22:19.647 --> 01:22:23.017
I'm here. - St. Louis is in good condition.

01:22:23.234 --> 01:22:28.525
Large your family is involved. - Thank God.

01:22:31.117 --> 01:22:34.403
Nähdään, Denver.
