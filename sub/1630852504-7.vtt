WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:02.934
- I saw the
surveillance footage.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.236
The de angelis case...

00:04.371 --> 00:05.938
(man):<i> Okay, okay, not moving.</i>
<i> Not fighting.</i>

00:05.940 --> 00:07.639
(kelly): The 10 seconds before
I came in...

00:07.675 --> 00:09.508
(keegan): He was guilty
and he's in jail

00:09.510 --> 00:11.643
Because of us.
- But you beat up a kid!

00:11.679 --> 00:14.480
And then, you lied about it
and you put me in a position

00:14.482 --> 00:15.781
Where I can't protect you.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.115
- Okay, just because there's
a job opening up,

00:17.184 --> 00:19.051
It doesn't mean that you need
to get into your head

00:19.053 --> 00:20.252
That you don't deserve
the promotion.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.853
- You actually think
you have a chance.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.255
It's still a man's world,
sammy.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.723
- You belong on a street team.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.925
- Hey, if I'm old enough
to spend the night in jail,

00:26.994 --> 00:30.029
I can make my own decisions
about where I want to live

00:30.164 --> 00:31.463
And who I want to date, right?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.931
- He'll be back.
This'll blow over.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.265
- Your boy isn't gonna
become trouble,

00:34.301 --> 00:36.034
Is he?
- No. He won't.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.303
- You brought a cop's kid here?
Now, I'm gonna need

00:38.339 --> 00:39.605
Some assurances.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.540
Now, your fingerprints
are all over that thing,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.542
And that burner is so dirty

00:43.677 --> 00:44.977
You're gonna be attached

00:45.112 --> 00:46.245
To everything that it's done.
(laughs)

00:46.380 --> 00:47.746
- What is wrong with you two?

00:47.815 --> 00:49.815
(layna): We're on molly.
You want some?

00:49.950 --> 00:52.551
(randy): We need to go
into business with this guy.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.820
- Buffalo just fronted us
10 keys.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.889
I want to move more,
I want to play it safer.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.423
We need a better
distribution plan too.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.558
(randy): Yeah. I know a guy.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
His car wash could use
a cash injection.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.961
- Okay, you trust him?

01:02.963 --> 01:04.729
- I don't trust anybody.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.304
(kelly sighing)

01:12.306 --> 01:15.774
- Ah! You slept out here
rather than come to bed.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.445
What's that about?
(sighing): I didn't sleep.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.113
- You still stewing
about keegan?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.781
- I don't know why
I didn't see it.

01:22.783 --> 01:23.982
- You did see it.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.651
You just learned to ignore it.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.987
Yeah, we normalize things
so we don't...

01:29.123 --> 01:31.056
Spend all our time in a rage.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.392
- I keep going through it all
in my head.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.993
Every case we worked together.

01:35.129 --> 01:38.597
What did I miss?
What did I... Ignore?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.132
What did I let happen?
- Oh, come on now,

01:40.201 --> 01:41.666
None of this
is your fault.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.335
- You can't know that.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.404
- But what I do know is you did
the right thing last week.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.406
Not everybody
would've done that.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.144
I gotta go, I got a meeting.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.613
- Alright. Sorry I wasn't
the greatest company.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.215
I'll make it up to you Friday.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.118
- I... Actually can't do Friday.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.452
- Why not?

02:00.454 --> 02:01.687
- I have plans.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.089
- What sort of plans
do you have?

02:04.224 --> 02:06.358
You got a software convention
or something?

02:06.427 --> 02:07.793
A board game night?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.828
- I have a "none of your
business" sort of plans.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.696
- Okay, so that's how
we're doing it?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.097
- That's how you doin' it.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.301
You're the one who insists
we are not a thing,

02:16.303 --> 02:17.769
We are not exclusive.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.772
(scoffing): I gave you a key.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.240
- A key is not a commitment.

02:23.377 --> 02:27.913
(sighing): So...
You have a date?

02:27.915 --> 02:31.049
On<i> our</i> Friday?
- Listen...

02:31.118 --> 02:32.985
If you ready
to be real with me,

02:33.120 --> 02:35.254
I will cancel those plans
right now

02:35.256 --> 02:36.722
And it will be our Friday.

02:36.857 --> 02:40.959
But if you want status quo,
my fridays are mine.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.730
(sam): I am possibly
the hardest working person

02:45.766 --> 02:46.798
In this building.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.267
I have an excellent
track record.

02:49.303 --> 02:52.037
I am organized, some people
actually call me meticulous.

02:52.106 --> 02:53.438
I'm sure you're aware
that I led the team

02:53.574 --> 02:54.806
That took down the saints,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.208
And I am almost there
with the stockwood crew.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.409
We actually just took down
stef bowen.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.844
- And what about his brother,
randy?

02:59.914 --> 03:02.280
- Randy bowen, well, I would
like you to know that

03:02.316 --> 03:03.481
We have a lot just of...

03:03.517 --> 03:05.417
Very huge amount of evidence
against him.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.085
Plethora... Of evidence.

03:07.087 --> 03:08.353
We have a warrant out
for his arrest.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.988
- But you don't have him.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.890
- That's correct.
We don't have him yet, sir,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.692
But we will have him
so very, very, very soon.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.560
And we will probably
have him by the time

03:15.563 --> 03:17.362
That you make
the decision about the job.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.998
Which is when, by the way?
- Friday.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.168
- Friday.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.436
- If you could get him
by Friday,

03:24.505 --> 03:27.172
Probably deserve the job.
(shanks and sam chuckle)

03:27.174 --> 03:28.240
- You're right, I would.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.908
Guess who's bringing him in
by Friday?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.043
This lady.
You want to know why?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.778
'cause I love bags and
putting men in them.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.346
I'm gonna have randy in a bag
by Friday.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.181
I'm gonna hand him right to you.
And you'll be like,

03:37.218 --> 03:39.017
"thank you for that bag."
and I'll be like, "no problem."

03:39.653 --> 03:41.286
Love it. Thank you.

03:41.288 --> 03:44.956
(uptempo music)

03:44.959 --> 03:46.057
Thank you.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.530
(cell phone ringing)

03:58.071 --> 03:59.237
- Hi, bill.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.939
(bill):<i> I'm sitting here,</i>

04:01.074 --> 04:03.475
<i> Staring out at the falls,</i>

04:03.544 --> 04:06.878
<i> I gotta say, it is still</i>
<i> something else.</i>

04:06.880 --> 04:10.082
<i> Next time you cross over,</i>
<i> you come see my pad.</i>

04:10.217 --> 04:11.149
<i> It's got a great view.</i>

04:11.285 --> 04:13.217
- I bet it does, bill.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.487
-<i> That said, the one thing</i>
<i> canada's got over the us,</i>

04:16.523 --> 04:19.791
<i> You got a view of the</i>
<i> american side of the falls.</i>

04:19.793 --> 04:21.626
<i> Now, I might be</i>
<i> the minority,</i>

04:21.695 --> 04:24.228
<i> But I think it's much more</i>
<i> spectacular.</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:27.566
(splashing)
<i> business coming along?</i>

04:29.470 --> 04:31.836
<i> Must be if you've got time</i>
<i> for a bath.</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:36.574
- Yeah. It's terrific.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.111
Shop's up and running,
everything's going great.

04:39.113 --> 04:43.381
<i> - Ah! Then I assume I'll be</i>
<i> seeing repayment any day then?</i>

04:43.417 --> 04:47.919
- We should be able to pay you,
in full, 200,000, next week.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.289
Bill?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.194
I-I mean, next week
the latest.

04:56.330 --> 05:00.131
Could be as early as Friday.
<i> - Friday's great.</i>

05:00.167 --> 05:01.966
<i> No, Friday is great.</i>

05:03.203 --> 05:04.069
- Okay.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.037
Friday it is.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.641
(sighing)

05:12.780 --> 05:16.081
(music continues)

05:21.622 --> 05:23.622
- Mm! Wazowski!
- Hi.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.824
- How that ds talent show go?
- Don't. Please, don't.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.092
- What?
- Shh.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.626
- Why you whispering?
- Because it's...

05:28.696 --> 05:29.761
(muttering): ...Private!

05:31.865 --> 05:32.764
It went really well.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.499
Super. Excellent.
Two thumbs up.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.901
I just have to prove myself
by Friday,

05:36.036 --> 05:37.769
So I need to... Or we need
to get randy bowen.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.370
- That's a pretty tall order.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.572
There's been no sign of him
for weeks,

05:40.707 --> 05:42.473
How the hell we gon' find him
in two days?

05:42.509 --> 05:44.242
- 'cause nothing motivates me
like a deadline.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.511
- Not me. Deadlines
are like ultimatums.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.913
And I hate ultimatums.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.516
Alright, naz,
what'd you find us?

05:51.651 --> 05:52.650
- Okay!

05:53.454 --> 05:54.352
(beep!)

05:55.622 --> 05:57.722
- Alright. Looks like some
auntie's banged-up hooptie.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.258
- Sure, if your auntie's
a coke dealer.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.727
(sam gasps): Wow!

06:02.730 --> 06:04.662
Check it out...
(kelly): Oh, yeah!

06:04.732 --> 06:05.897
I've seen those before.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.465
Audio guys put those in
with the speakers.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.000
Take your custom-built key fob

06:09.002 --> 06:11.269
- Boop boop - pops right open.
(naz): Yeah.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.738
Uniforms found the vehicle on
the side of the road last week.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.473
Impound guys found the soft
this morning

06:15.542 --> 06:16.941
When they were taking out
the stereo for resale.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.276
- Who owns the vehicle?

06:18.412 --> 06:20.478
(naz): That, detective,
is why you're here.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.015
Ah. It's registered
to gertrude bruce.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.551
She died last year.
She was 85. No next of kin.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.220
- I thought you said that you
found it last week.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.821
- We did. Here's the thing:

06:29.956 --> 06:31.823
She just so happened to live
on the same street

06:31.892 --> 06:33.959
As your boy randy bowen.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.495
- Yowza! Really?! Are you...?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.129
Okay, you see, you want it,
you will it.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.330
It's from<i> the secret,</i>
you should read it.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.899
Was there any prints?
- Wiped clean,

06:41.034 --> 06:43.034
But we are trying. Now,
we can trace the serial number

06:43.036 --> 06:45.236
Of the stereo to find out
at least where it was installed.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.107
We found this,
under the seat.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.575
I think it's antibiotics.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.311
- Can't lie, bacterial infection
says "bowen" to me.

06:53.347 --> 06:54.579
(chuckling)
(naz): Label's faded,

06:54.581 --> 06:55.713
Must've gone through the wash.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.582
But forensics is trying
to crack it now.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.850
One last thing...

06:58.886 --> 07:00.318
You're gonna love this.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.920
One black bandana.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.595
- Oh... Yes, please.
(kelly inhales)

07:10.664 --> 07:12.797
Who's disgusting little hairs
are these?

07:12.866 --> 07:13.664
Huh?
- Ew.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.933
- Yeah. Randy bowen.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.201
One more point there.
- Yeah?

07:16.270 --> 07:17.602
- What was that about
a tall order?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.471
- Fine. Don't get too cocky,
waze.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.940
A lot can happen between
today and Friday.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.411
(sam): Okay.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.880
We have surveillance footage
on randy's home,

07:28.882 --> 07:30.215
Randy's place of business...

07:30.217 --> 07:32.016
- Every hooters in
a five-mile radius.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.084
- All his local hangouts.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.152
There is no sign of him
anywhere,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.753
But my theory is

07:35.789 --> 07:37.955
He is using his minions
to keep the business running

07:37.991 --> 07:39.758
And then, he stole poor
gertrude's car to get around.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.259
- So bowen crashes his ride,

07:41.394 --> 07:43.161
Then skedaddles before someone
can call it in.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.163
- Hey, sam, I found
that stereo guy.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.900
Sounds like he's in demand.
No record.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.102
But the guy's tricked out half
the sports cars in this city.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.037
- Lemme see that.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.072
- Pretty sure I said sam.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.606
- What? Are we in grade 2?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.210
Oh... Or is this
about keegan?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.712
- I'm sorry, is somebody
speaking?

08:01.748 --> 08:03.848
'cause I hear something...
Annoying.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.117
(sam): Hamm!
- Fine, go ahead, be that guy.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.786
- Or you could be the guy
who finds out

08:07.788 --> 08:09.453
Who prescribed the antibiotics.
Thank you.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.195
- What? So everybody knows
I reported keegan?

08:18.232 --> 08:20.732
- Hey, let's just give them
something else to talk about.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.099
(softly): Duff!

08:23.370 --> 08:26.771
So, hey, our stereo guy?
It's one jean-michel navarro.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.009
- Oh, man.
Are you kidding me?

08:32.479 --> 08:34.346
- You okay to go to
your grandma's for a few days?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.047
- Can I bring my video games?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.148
- No!
- Yes!

08:37.150 --> 08:38.416
- You've got better things to do

08:38.552 --> 08:41.553
Than sit around playing
video games.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.027
- Take it.
I know you both love chinese!

08:49.029 --> 08:50.895
- We don't need your money,
thank you.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.297
I'm gonna teach you
how to bake lasagna,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.533
And then, you're gonna help me
clean out my storage room.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.002
Okay?
(whispering): Sorry.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.104
(sol sighs)

09:08.582 --> 09:09.847
Are you ever gonna give me
a chance?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.315
- Probably not.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.585
The more he's with me,
the better.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.219
(cell phone ringing)
(tiggy sighs)

09:17.357 --> 09:18.990
- Bye, baby!
(door closes)

09:20.227 --> 09:21.526
(randy):<i> Hey.</i>
- Hey.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.061
We need to pull
a payment to misiano.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.864
- Well, why?
<i> - Because he's getting antsy.</i>

09:25.999 --> 09:27.198
<i> What? We don't have</i>
<i> enough money?</i>

09:27.234 --> 09:28.600
- We got enough money.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.934
<i> - Then we're paying it back.</i>

09:30.003 --> 09:32.070
Tell all your guys to settle up
before Friday,

09:32.205 --> 09:33.338
I don't want to
drain the cash flow.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.339
<i> - Yeah, yeah.</i>

09:34.341 --> 09:35.906
I got it.

09:36.876 --> 09:37.942
- Was that tiggy?

09:39.513 --> 09:41.079
Randy, I don't feel good
about this.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.481
- What's the combination?
(sighs)

09:44.451 --> 09:46.417
Come on, babe!
Don't make me wait.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.555
- It's probably 10-31-01.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.189
(clicking)

09:53.393 --> 09:54.759
(sighs)

09:54.761 --> 09:56.361
- Why do you have a snake
in here?

09:56.496 --> 09:57.829
- Oh, we just brought her
to the vet.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.864
The poor little thing is sick.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.166
- Does tiggy know you're digging
around in the safe?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.606
Huh?
(randy sighs)

10:09.876 --> 10:11.909
- What do you think?
- I mean...

10:11.945 --> 10:13.311
You're her partner, right?
So, I'm sure it's totally...

10:13.446 --> 10:14.679
Yeah, it's totally--
- yeah!

10:14.715 --> 10:15.614
(all laugh)

10:15.749 --> 10:16.982
- It's totally fine, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.917
- Yeah. Listen, ernie,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.886
I need to bring a couple guys
over on our new project.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.521
So where's snug?
Is he around?

10:23.557 --> 10:26.257
- Uh, sure, if you want your
crew unsupervised all night.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.861
- Right. What about danica
or maybe dean?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.730
- Dean's in charge
of operations

10:31.865 --> 10:33.331
I mean, danica's
your best runner, I--

10:33.333 --> 10:34.465
(randy groans softly)

10:34.501 --> 10:36.000
I mean, I could give
you guys leon.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.736
- Leon?
- Yeah.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.538
- I don't know leon.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.006
No. I don't want him.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.208
Let's roll, baby.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.776
Take her easy, ernie.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.748
(door slamming)

10:49.883 --> 10:51.182
- Randy!

10:52.619 --> 10:55.153
Tig doesn't want to sell
mdma, okay?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.488
She doesn't want to go into
business with another stranger,

10:57.524 --> 10:59.357
She's gonna to kill us
if she finds out.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.825
- She's not gonna kill us,
okay?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.293
She's gonna want to kiss
my balls

11:02.329 --> 11:03.961
When she sees
how good of a deal it is.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.563
- Well, let's just
explain it to her.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.231
- Well, you might be her bitch,
but I'm not.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.233
- I'm not her bitch.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.338
- Are you my bitch?
- Oh, shut up!

11:15.275 --> 11:16.307
- Are you?

11:19.413 --> 11:20.412
Say it.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.250
- I'm your bitch.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.252
- Good.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.855
Now let's get mercedes back

11:30.990 --> 11:32.390
'cause I got some business
to do.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.166
- Navarro!

11:43.003 --> 11:44.201
- Hey! Hey!

11:45.539 --> 11:46.871
So...
- 'sup!

11:46.873 --> 11:47.872
- 'sup!

11:48.007 --> 11:50.608
You a cop now, huh?
(kelly chuckles)

11:50.744 --> 11:52.744
I don't get it,
you were always so cool.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.512
What happened?
- Hey. Should I lead this one?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.481
- No. Navarro used to date
my little sister

11:56.616 --> 11:58.483
When she'd visit from new york
in the summers.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.285
- Adriana duff.
- Uh-huh.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.586
- Everybody wanted
to get with her,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.187
But I was the lucky one, right?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.688
- Yeah. You had a car
and no record,

12:04.725 --> 12:06.491
You were a catch,
my friend.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.159
(navarro): Hm!

12:08.161 --> 12:11.696
- Mr. Navarro, did you install
a stereo into this vehicle?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.697
- Look, I can't remember
every ride I've worked on.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.067
- Do you remember randy bowen?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.768
Because we have reason
to believe

12:17.804 --> 12:19.037
That he drove
this vehicle.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.504
Very, very recently.

12:21.775 --> 12:22.440
No?
- I don't...

12:22.575 --> 12:23.808
- Okay. How about this?

12:23.943 --> 12:26.111
You and I, we just peruse
your files together,

12:26.246 --> 12:27.579
See if that doesn't
jog your memory?

12:27.714 --> 12:28.913
- Look, I work freelance.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.648
This might've come to me
through ritz motors.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.117
I sometimes get referrals
from there.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.252
- Okay. Does the secret
drug-trafficking compartment,

12:34.321 --> 12:36.687
Does that come with the stereo,
or is that just an add-on?

12:36.723 --> 12:38.456
- Hold up. That's what
you all here for?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.458
You've gotta be kidding me.
Look, I swear to god,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.127
I would never install something
if I knew it was for drugs.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.798
- Really? Okay. So you do
install the compartments,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.899
What I'm wondering is, what
did you think they were for?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.936
- I don't know.
Computers, laptops, cell phones.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.471
Stuff you don't want
your girl to find.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.738
Look, lady,
I don't ask questions

12:54.775 --> 12:56.407
And I can't afford
to turn down work.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.542
I got two daughters,
single dad.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.482
C'mon duff, you know
I'm not the type.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.150
You would've never let me
date adey

13:06.186 --> 13:07.418
If you thought I was
too street.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.021
- You were okay.
- Yeah, well...

13:10.090 --> 13:12.123
Probably helped that you
threatened to smash my head in

13:12.258 --> 13:13.891
If I broke
your sister's heart.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.860
You know, come to think of it,

13:15.996 --> 13:18.797
This whole cop thing's not
too much of a stretch after all.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.135
- Alright.
Good to see you, jean-michel.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.304
Thanks.
- Yeah. Good to see you too.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.774
- Duff.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.511
You know your friend back there
is lying his butt off, right?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.779
- What are you talking about?

13:34.914 --> 13:36.981
He just gave us the lead
for ritz motors.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.850
- How many drugs have been
hidden in those compartments?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.051
How many guns?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.385
Duff, how many lives
could we save

13:41.454 --> 13:43.187
If we take down a guy like that?
- Yeah,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.590
But we can't prove that he knew
it was to store drugs and guns.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.324
All kind of reasons
people hide things.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.993
- Oh!
- Especially in neighbourhoods

13:48.995 --> 13:50.995
You've never even been to,
except to wear a vest.

13:51.031 --> 13:55.066
- Yeah? If he does know,
guess what?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.268
We can charge him
with conspiracy to traffic.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.803
- Just because he doesn't
trust cops,

13:58.872 --> 14:00.538
Doesn't mean he's a criminal.
- Yeah?

14:00.540 --> 14:01.873
And just because
he's your homeboy,

14:01.942 --> 14:03.541
Doesn't mean he's not one.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.675
- Really?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.878
- Wo-- okay, I would
very much like

14:06.880 --> 14:08.078
To retract the word
"homeboy".

14:08.114 --> 14:09.914
- Yeah. Consider it retracted.

14:10.050 --> 14:10.981
- Thank you.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.353
- Hey, snug, randy was by
looking for you.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.621
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.823
- Is he coming back?
- Probably.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.558
- Oh, then I'm getting
outta here.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.825
(both laugh)

14:21.862 --> 14:23.093
I'm not, you know...

14:23.129 --> 14:25.763
<i> Alright...</i>
- Snug, you little bastard.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.365
(ernie):<i> Welcome to</i>
<i> ritz motors.</i>

14:27.500 --> 14:30.200
How can I help you?
- Hey. Uh...

14:31.504 --> 14:34.105
I... Have a dent in my car.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.441
- Okay. Bring it in Thursday.
- It's... Well, I'm here now.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.943
- Yeah, sorry,
we're swamped today.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.177
- You're swamped?
- Uh-huh.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.713
- Wow. This is swamped
for you?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.648
And you didn't even check
your computer screen

14:43.650 --> 14:45.383
Or your schedule...

14:45.385 --> 14:48.052
Make more of an effort
if you want my business.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.720
- I guess I don't want
your business.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.823
- Well, uh, I think I need
to talk to the manager.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.891
- Lady, I am the manager.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.095
(classic rock playing
in the shop)

15:01.935 --> 15:04.268
- You gave the man an ultimatum.
- Uh-huh.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.870
- He didn't bite.
- No. Guess what? I don't care.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.773
Because someone named
randy bowen is showing up

15:08.842 --> 15:10.741
And we're gonna be here
to catch him.

15:10.777 --> 15:11.876
Yes!

15:20.420 --> 15:21.485
- You realize there's

15:21.554 --> 15:23.220
A gazillion randys
in this city, right?

15:23.290 --> 15:26.156
I mean, I've booked
four this year.

15:26.192 --> 15:29.694
- I know. But realistically,
snug only knows one, maybe two.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.095
- Okay, well, say it is bowen,

15:31.230 --> 15:32.529
He could pop up between
now and never.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.499
We could be here all night.
- Exactly!

15:34.634 --> 15:37.568
And that is why
I brought us some lovely snacks.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.705
Would you like a beer?
- No. I'm working.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.640
- It's non-alcoholic.
Come on!

15:42.642 --> 15:46.577
- Ugh. All the calories without
the pesky buzz, huh?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.846
No thank you.
- You want a finger sandwich?

15:48.848 --> 15:50.848
I got cucumber and...
And cream cheese.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.284
- No, I cannot eat cream cheese.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.519
(loud crunching)

15:59.092 --> 16:01.259
Let me ask you something.
- Sure.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.127
- Why did you wanna be a cop?

16:03.129 --> 16:04.595
- Do you know how much
law school is?

16:04.664 --> 16:05.596
- No.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.399
- It's a lot.
It's a lot, a lot.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.001
Also, I think...

16:10.136 --> 16:12.603
I really just wanted to help
keep people safe.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.005
You are looking at
riverside prep's

16:14.074 --> 16:16.841
Longest-serving hall monitor.
(kelly chuckles)

16:16.976 --> 16:20.210
I know. I loved it so much.
I still have the sash.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.046
- Of course, you do.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.348
Do you feel like you're
doing that, helping people?

16:24.417 --> 16:26.684
- Yeah. I do.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.085
Like, every gun we get
off the street,

16:28.221 --> 16:29.486
Every asshole
that we put away.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.222
I believe people should pay
for their bad choices.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.291
- Yeah, but some people, that's
the only option they have.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.594
Not everyone gets a buffet of...
All-you-can-eat choices.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.296
- That's fair.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.498
How 'bout you?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.501
Why'd you want
to become a cop?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.436
- Would you believe it?
<i> Knight rider.</i>

16:45.571 --> 16:48.906
(laughing): 'cause you wanted to
have a magic car for a partner?

16:48.975 --> 16:52.043
- Yeah. You can program
a magic car to be quiet.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.246
Plus, rocket boosters, baby.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.349
(sam): Oh...
Duff, check it out.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.784
Look at that red beater,
look familiar?

16:59.919 --> 17:00.717
(camera clicking)

17:00.754 --> 17:02.387
- Oh, yes, it does.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.590
Hello, dean.
Welcome back, danica.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.659
Wow. Out on bail a week, and
she's already back in the game.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.461
- Yeah. Still no randy.

17:10.497 --> 17:14.131
- Yeah, but it's a helluva lot
of stockwoods.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.766
Nice!

17:15.835 --> 17:18.936
(suspenseful music)

17:21.340 --> 17:23.140
(sam sighs)

17:23.176 --> 17:24.341
(kelly grunts)

17:24.377 --> 17:25.877
- If you want to nap,
you just go ahead.

17:26.012 --> 17:28.345
- No, no, nope.
I'm good. I'm good.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.083
You look tired, though.
Why don't you go ahead and...

17:32.085 --> 17:33.884
Close them for a minute?
I got this.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.653
- It's okay. Four eyes
are better than two.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.089
Except if you're a kid

17:38.091 --> 17:40.091
And you wear aviator glasses
and headgear,

17:40.226 --> 17:42.659
And some really mean, mean,
mean girl called

17:42.695 --> 17:45.096
Maxine blanchard calls you
terrible names

17:45.231 --> 17:47.698
Like four-eyes
and head gear.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.634
- Oh my god, that's terrible.
- I know!

17:49.769 --> 17:52.370
- I could've come up with
much better names than that.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.706
Like zippy lips, speccysam,
white urkel.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.909
- Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
- Ugh. "did I do that?"

17:58.945 --> 18:01.378
(both chuckling)

18:01.380 --> 18:04.381
- I wasn't, like, really popular
with the boys back then.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.950
- Oh yeah? How different
is that from now?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.385
- Yeah, it's not...
Very different.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.120
Ugh...

18:10.156 --> 18:11.722
How 'bout you and nathan,
what's going on?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.658
(exasperated exhale)

18:13.793 --> 18:16.527
Come on, give me some of that
sugar, spill the tea...

18:16.662 --> 18:18.929
(sing-songy): Give me some sugar
and spill the tea. Duff!

18:20.733 --> 18:22.333
I'm gonna be straight
with you.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.068
If I had someone like that,

18:24.070 --> 18:27.404
That was really nice, and like,
reliable and handsome,

18:27.440 --> 18:30.541
If I had that, I wouldn't be
hemming and hawing.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.211
(sam exhaling loudly)

18:33.213 --> 18:36.547
- Cheese grater. Magnet mouth.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.950
Ooh! Ooh! Wirezowski.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.751
- Okay! That's...

18:40.820 --> 18:43.420
(kelly): Your new name.
(sam): It's not. Please.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.891
(soft indie music)

18:53.433 --> 18:56.234
- How many breakfast sandwiches
are you gonna eat?

18:56.369 --> 18:57.834
(song continues on car radio)

18:57.871 --> 18:59.837
- I only have, like,
two left.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.841
- Do you always eat
when you're stressed?

19:04.878 --> 19:07.244
- I've never been...
This stressed before.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.546
(sighing)

19:08.681 --> 19:10.147
It's kind of my first time
having my fingerprints

19:10.183 --> 19:11.381
On a murder weapon.
- Elliot...

19:13.586 --> 19:16.753
I got you into this,
I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.522
Okay?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.525
I promise.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.038
(kelly sighs)

19:36.075 --> 19:37.675
- You two get any sleep
last night?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.543
- Oh my god, no, we've been
chatting like two best friends.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.811
First, I started with
my teen years...

19:40.880 --> 19:42.346
Then I moved into my twenties,
which was, like,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.215
A super, super
fun decade,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.417
And then, into my thirties
which is, like, a little bit
more tragic.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.618
- Oh, hey.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.553
What's up? I didn't
hear you come in.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.021
- Any sign of randy
overnight?

19:51.090 --> 19:52.489
- Nah, just his crew.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.624
- Yeah, but that's no problem.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.225
Because we-we have one more day.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.628
Guys? Guys, we have
one more day...

19:57.664 --> 19:59.163
Wait a se--
duff?

20:00.366 --> 20:03.234
Check this out,
the red junker's back.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.337
- Danica needs her car washed
after one night?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.673
Either she lives a dirty,
dirty life, or--

20:08.675 --> 20:10.074
- There's something going on
in that car wash.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.975
- This must be how stockwood's
pushing their product.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.378
- Yeah. The runners, they go in
for a scrub, and then they...

20:14.380 --> 20:16.413
Pack as much cocaine as
they can into their hidey-holes!

20:17.950 --> 20:19.450
- You are a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.686
- What?
- How fast can we set up

20:21.688 --> 20:23.186
An undercover job
to prove this theory?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.389
- I don't know.
Depends how dirty your car is.

20:25.524 --> 20:26.957
- As dirty as you want it to be.

20:35.334 --> 20:38.202
- Excuse me. Excuse me. We get
10 bucks an hour, plus tips?

20:38.337 --> 20:39.503
- Yup.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.005
- Looks like we score, huh?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.474
(sam, over earpiece):<i> Sure did.</i>

20:44.510 --> 20:46.610
Okay. We just have to catch them
handing off the product,

20:46.679 --> 20:48.346
And then, we can take down
this whole operation.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.814
- Yo, lady!

20:49.949 --> 20:52.182
Put some elbow grease into it.

20:52.252 --> 20:57.021
Listen, if you wanna play,
you don't get the pay.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.388
Capisce?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.325
(ernie, over radio):
<i> You no speaky no english?</i>

21:01.461 --> 21:02.225
- Oh god...
(ernie):<i> Huh?</i>

21:02.262 --> 21:03.928
Hello!

21:04.063 --> 21:05.896
- I don't think
she speak asshole.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.699
- What did you say to me?

21:10.703 --> 21:13.170
Yeah, well, whatever.

21:14.507 --> 21:18.442
Just shut your pie holes,
and scrub-a-dub... Beavers.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.282
- That guy's a dick.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.584
- Uh-huh.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.454
(suspenseful music)

21:37.330 --> 21:39.930
(coughing): Danica's back again.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.333
(sam):<i> How many times can</i>
<i> she wash that thing?</i>

21:42.402 --> 21:44.535
- Alright, we're going in,
keep your eyes on dean.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.136
(engine turns)
(kelly):<i> I'm on it.</i>

21:55.948 --> 21:58.148
I knew you were in on it, creep.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.684
Alright, dean's got the soft.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.788
(sam): Copy that. We're inside
and right behind danica.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.524
(sighing)

22:09.929 --> 22:12.596
This is nice!

22:14.500 --> 22:16.666
- What?
- Like, I love a car wash!

22:17.804 --> 22:19.403
- Me too, actually.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.971
I brought my first girlfriend
through one

22:21.107 --> 22:23.307
So I could kiss her
with nobody seeing!

22:23.442 --> 22:25.009
- Oh my god!
Okay, wow!

22:25.144 --> 22:27.644
That's really...
Is that, like, because...

22:27.680 --> 22:29.312
You were embarrassed by her
or it's...

22:29.349 --> 22:30.648
Because like, oh, you're like,

22:30.783 --> 22:32.249
"oh my god,
this is so romantic."

22:32.318 --> 22:33.584
- I was just shy.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.519
- Yeah, like, I don't think
it's romantic, either,

22:35.588 --> 22:37.388
I was just saying that...

22:40.593 --> 22:44.261
- Jeez!
(imitating a horn blaring)

22:44.263 --> 22:45.329
Hey!
(danica): Long time.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.131
You look good, bro!
- Thank you.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.866
I'm feeling fresh out here,
you know what I'm saying?

22:49.001 --> 22:49.966
(danica): Yeah.
(sam):<i> Duff?!</i>

22:51.237 --> 22:53.336
Do you have eyes on the coke?
(ernie):<i> Hey, cutie pies!</i>

22:53.373 --> 22:56.073
Bathroom floor needs a mop.
Right now.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.575
- Oh my god!

22:57.710 --> 22:59.209
- Come on! That guy again?

22:59.245 --> 23:01.445
- Hey, and just so you know,
boys around here,

23:01.580 --> 23:03.413
They shoot sideways.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.682
Inside! Now!
(kelly): Yeah, yeah.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.818
No, I'm sorry. Oh,
whoa, whoa, whoa, look! Look.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.719
Two dudes just went in there,
they looked real sketchy.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.088
They looked like they foreign.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.722
They foreign!

23:21.167 --> 23:22.900
- Yo, some sketched up shit
going on here.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.034
Just take the thing.
(danica): Alright.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.736
- I'll catch you on the flip
side, alright?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.003
- I got you.
- See you later.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.175
(sam):<i> Did you see it?</i>
<i> Did you see it?!</i>

23:32.412 --> 23:33.710
Duff!

23:34.881 --> 23:37.181
- Alright. Tell breann
I saw the handoff.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.315
Danica is headed her way.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.116
- Hey, lady, what was
that about?

23:40.153 --> 23:41.852
Where the hell you going?

23:41.921 --> 23:45.389
- I'm gonna enjoy taking down
your racist, misogynistic,

23:45.391 --> 23:47.725
Power-tripping, stupid ass.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.526
- Licence and registration,
please.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.962
- Yo, I didn't do anything.
You're wasting your time.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.997
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

23:57.804 --> 24:00.203
- Okay. One moment.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.143
Hey. Wha-what am I
holding her on?

24:06.212 --> 24:07.611
I can't search her
without an arrest.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.180
- Oh, right, uh...

24:11.451 --> 24:12.950
Danica's conditions for release,
they include a red zone,

24:12.952 --> 24:15.386
A restricted area or something?
- Yes, they sure do. Nice!

24:15.521 --> 24:16.654
Stockwood central.

24:16.656 --> 24:17.721
- Oh, yes, thank you.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.362
Okay. Step out of the vehicle.
(clears throat): Please.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.664
- Are you serious right now?

24:28.401 --> 24:29.166
- Come on.

24:35.441 --> 24:36.907
You broke bail, kiddo.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.576
- Ugh!

24:39.645 --> 24:41.178
- Okay, will you quit waving
that fob around

24:41.313 --> 24:44.181
Like you're casting a spell?
- Oh!

24:44.316 --> 24:45.215
(grunting and sighing)

24:45.284 --> 24:46.850
- Duff, are you sure,

24:46.919 --> 24:49.586
Like, really sure that you
saw dean hand off to danica?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.755
- You've asked me that question
five times now

24:51.757 --> 24:54.325
And my answer is still
yes, I am sure.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.126
- Hey. Would you two quit it?

24:56.128 --> 24:57.928
As soon as ritz finds out that
danica's in custody,

24:57.964 --> 24:59.530
The whole operation's blown.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.232
- You have to trust me, alright?
There's coke in there,

25:01.367 --> 25:02.365
We just have to find it.

25:03.002 --> 25:03.767
What--

25:03.836 --> 25:04.935
Just give me this!
- What?!

25:04.971 --> 25:06.103
Where are you going?

25:06.238 --> 25:07.871
- I'm gonna talk
to jean-michel alone.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.106
- Why?

25:09.108 --> 25:10.508
Because you think
he doesn't want me there?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.409
- No. I don't.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.144
- Well, that's rude!

25:29.295 --> 25:31.828
- Hey, uh...
What if he's home?

25:31.864 --> 25:34.898
- This is gonna be
a whole lot harder if he's not.

25:35.801 --> 25:36.633
- What is?

25:37.836 --> 25:40.637
- I'm going to remove
the muffler from my car.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.573
- Why?

25:43.809 --> 25:45.042
- Because there's nothing
that randy loves more

25:45.177 --> 25:47.311
Than explaining to somebody
how to fix a car.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.114
You are going to ask him to
help you tie up the muffler

25:50.249 --> 25:52.449
While I hang back,
say I have to pee,

25:52.451 --> 25:54.451
And hopefully, the gun is still
in the drawer

25:54.487 --> 25:55.919
So I can wipe it off...

25:55.922 --> 25:59.255
And we're golden.
- Okay. Uh...

26:02.394 --> 26:04.228
- So, if you double production,

26:04.230 --> 26:06.129
We'll take care
of any extra costs

26:06.198 --> 26:07.631
And exporting to the us.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.133
Then, we'll just split
everything fifty-fifty, clean.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.536
- I gotta say, I feel like
a real gangster,

26:12.605 --> 26:14.804
Talking business with
the infamous randy bowen.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.740
- As I say, I have sampled
your product,

26:16.875 --> 26:18.542
And it is pretty solid.

26:18.544 --> 26:19.777
- You should come see
my warehouse.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.078
I've got a sweet set-up.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.080
I got two of my engineering
buddies

26:23.082 --> 26:25.415
To come set up special
voltage stations, generators,

26:25.451 --> 26:26.951
Air circulation--
- but I am gonna have to have

26:27.086 --> 26:29.486
A couple of my guys thrown
in the mix, of course,

26:29.555 --> 26:31.888
You know, just to keep
eyes on the prize.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.924
- Who did you have in mind?
- I don't know.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.992
Still working on that.
(knocking on door)

26:37.896 --> 26:39.029
One minute.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.498
(randy exhales slowly)

26:47.039 --> 26:48.172
Hey.
- Hey, randy.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.172
- 'sup?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.341
- Oh, sorry to interrupt,
we just--

26:50.476 --> 26:51.608
I got uh,

26:51.611 --> 26:53.710
My muffler on my car is--
- come on in.

26:54.880 --> 26:55.846
Come on!

26:57.249 --> 27:00.017
Here they are now,
two of my finest minions.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.552
This is nelson lam.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.922
I want jackie and shaggy here
to be my point people.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.658
You want to do the deal,

27:07.660 --> 27:10.160
These two are going in
as my eyes and ears.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.596
I got reason to believe that
they'll never double-cross me.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.664
- Uh...

27:13.799 --> 27:15.332
What am I supposed to do
with them?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.867
- I don't know.
Make 'em your guards.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.802
They can shoot people
when they get out of line.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.003
- Whoa!
- What?

27:20.006 --> 27:21.438
- We're not being your guards.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.407
- You'll do what I tell you.
- Or...

27:23.476 --> 27:25.075
I can use more drivers,

27:25.111 --> 27:27.077
But they have to be able
to get around undetected.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.512
- No, I like my idea better.
- Yeah, you don't look like

27:29.548 --> 27:31.247
You know downtown well enough
to be a driver.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.416
N-no--
- hey, man.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.951
- No--
- the fastest way downtown

27:34.086 --> 27:36.019
From here isn't kipling,
it's dale avenue,

27:36.055 --> 27:37.888
At... Glen road.
There's a little alleyway there,

27:37.957 --> 27:39.022
It gets you right there.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.557
And... Uh,

27:40.626 --> 27:42.026
Everyone thinks islington's
the best road to take

27:42.161 --> 27:44.161
During rush hour,
but it's actually royal york,

27:44.163 --> 27:46.529
'cause everyone thinks
it's gonna be so packed.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.831
- How do you even know this?

27:47.900 --> 27:50.434
- Yeah, I-I stole my dad's car
when I was 16

27:50.503 --> 27:54.037
And he just... Made me work it
off delivering law contracts.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.440
I know the city like
the back of my hand now, so...

27:57.510 --> 27:59.309
If you need a driver,
I-I can drive.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.577
(clears his throat)

28:01.914 --> 28:02.712
- Okay?

28:04.383 --> 28:05.382
Okay!

28:07.319 --> 28:09.119
We got ourselves a deal.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.955
Put her there, partner.

28:14.794 --> 28:15.792
(chuckling)

28:20.966 --> 28:22.132
(navarro sighs)

28:23.436 --> 28:27.204
- Listen, I gotta take the girls
to soccer tonight, uh...

28:27.339 --> 28:29.406
And I'm "snack dad", so--
- alright, well, help me out,

28:29.541 --> 28:32.009
Make this real quick.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.210
- You gotta be kidding me.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.012
(exhaling loudly):
What, you think every car

28:35.147 --> 28:36.213
With a compartment in it
is mine?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.481
- Come on, navarro,

28:37.550 --> 28:39.349
Don't make me pull
your client list, man.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.218
We both know what trouble
that could spell for you

28:41.287 --> 28:42.352
If word got out.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.287
- It's why I know
you wouldn't do it.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.690
You might be with the feds now,

28:46.692 --> 28:48.725
But you're still kelly duff.
- I'm detective duff.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.894
And right now,
you're under suspicion

28:50.963 --> 28:52.296
For conspiracy to traffic.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.364
- I don't get how you can
wear that badge

28:54.400 --> 28:56.699
After everything the cops
did to our neighbourhood.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.502
How many kids from school
are behind bars

28:58.504 --> 28:59.903
Or never made it
to graduation?

28:59.905 --> 29:01.705
Not to mention your brother!

29:01.840 --> 29:04.641
- No, those kids are why
I wear my badge.

29:05.511 --> 29:06.643
There was nobody
protecting them.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.579
Nobody protecting us!

29:08.714 --> 29:11.582
At least I can try.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.918
So... Are you gonna make
this easy for yourself or not?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.587
- Come on, you know
it doesn't work like that.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.388
It's hard either way.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.257
- I'll go get started
on that warrant then.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.458
(soft music)

29:25.865 --> 29:26.997
- Wait.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.533
Gimme the keys.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.539
(sighs)

29:36.575 --> 29:39.076
Under the front seat's
a pressure sensor.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.211
The door's gotta be closed
for it to work.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.679
Then, you turn on the defrost.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.415
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.085
Swipe the fob key
across the air vent,

29:48.087 --> 29:49.753
And press this button
right here.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.488
That opens the stereo.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.356
Compartment's in there.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.124
Here. Hold on.

29:56.695 --> 29:57.827
- That's one helluva gizmo.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.830
- Oh, hell yeah.
Check it out.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.900
It's got insulation,
waterproof lining, the works.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.903
- Alright, so how much
volume we talking?

30:06.038 --> 30:07.304
Could it fit my glock?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.839
- Ten of them if you wanted.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.007
These babies can hold six keys
if you pack 'em in it ri--

30:13.312 --> 30:14.878
- Six keys, huh?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.480
- Nah, what I meant
to say was...

30:16.482 --> 30:17.714
That's just what I heard...

30:19.151 --> 30:20.917
- You should've stuck
to stereos.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.825
Wazowski.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.995
I know how to get at the drugs.

30:36.569 --> 30:40.203
- Okay! Clock's ticking
on this one, people, so...

30:40.272 --> 30:42.071
Who are our targets?
(kelly): This is dean.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.140
He's the point man,
passes out the product.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.343
This guy runs the place. Ernie.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.513
Saw him hand the soft to dean.
- Who's the guy in the middle?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.916
- Navarro, our compartment whiz.
(shanks): So, he's involved.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.251
- Well, it's not really illegal

30:54.320 --> 30:56.186
To install a compartment
in a car.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.687
- Unless he had
knowledge of usage.

30:57.756 --> 30:58.755
Are you saying he didn't?

30:58.824 --> 31:01.591
- I me--
there's no proof he did.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.160
- Okay. For those of you

31:04.230 --> 31:06.563
Who do not know this charming
fellow, this is randy bowen.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.231
If you come across him
during these raids,

31:08.234 --> 31:09.299
You're to report directly to me

31:09.368 --> 31:11.234
Or to detective duff.
- Or me!

31:11.237 --> 31:12.736
- Never to him.
- What?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.806
- No, thank you.
Just... Right here.

31:15.808 --> 31:16.673
(woman): Okay.

31:16.709 --> 31:20.110
(uptempo music)

31:20.112 --> 31:21.845
(tires screeching)

31:21.914 --> 31:22.845
(horn blaring)

31:22.882 --> 31:24.948
- Oh! Hey!
Oh, hey.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.450
(naz): Police!
(sam): Nobody move!

31:26.585 --> 31:28.151
Detective wazowski,
you're all under arrest!

31:28.220 --> 31:29.720
(kelly): Hands where
I can see 'em!

31:29.855 --> 31:31.154
(sam): I said, "nobody move!"
(naz): Don't you move!

31:31.223 --> 31:32.522
- Don't move!
- Hey! You heard her!

31:32.524 --> 31:34.090
(man): Get your hands up!
(naz): Don't you move!

31:34.126 --> 31:35.726
- I said, "nobody move!"
(man): I got a runner!

31:35.861 --> 31:37.627
- Turn around! Turn around now!
(man): I'm not moving!

31:37.696 --> 31:39.829
(man): Go get him! Go get him!
(siren wailing)

31:42.534 --> 31:44.000
(grunting)

31:45.671 --> 31:47.270
(dean): Argh!
(hamm grunting)

31:48.173 --> 31:50.207
- Nice move.
- Thanks.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.475
I call it the hood slide.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.209
- Everybody calls it
the hood slide.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.680
- You thought I was great
with a rag, huh?

31:56.682 --> 31:57.948
Well, guess what?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.950
You gonna love how I handle
a pair of cuffs.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.551
(sam): Okay, everybody,
bring it in!

32:01.553 --> 32:04.221
That's right, listen up,
you are all up poop creek,

32:04.356 --> 32:06.556
However, if you want to talk
to me about randy bowen

32:06.592 --> 32:08.024
Or tell me where he is,

32:08.160 --> 32:10.060
I can say that you
were cooperative.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.195
So, if you would like
to just give me--

32:12.231 --> 32:13.764
Oh yeah, you can't because

32:13.899 --> 32:15.698
You're all in front of
your colleagues, so could y--

32:15.734 --> 32:18.335
Just give m-- give me a sign!

32:18.470 --> 32:20.170
Something really subtle.
No one will know.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.972
Maybe one of these.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.507
If you do that, I will know.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.008
Anyone?

32:25.044 --> 32:27.444
Anyone?
Anyone know anything?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.445
Would you or you?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.046
Were you crossing your--

32:31.450 --> 32:32.382
Anyone?

32:32.517 --> 32:33.850
Anyone?

32:35.153 --> 32:36.253
Anyone...

32:36.255 --> 32:37.454
Please tell me someone...

32:37.523 --> 32:38.255
- No.
- Anyone?

32:38.390 --> 32:39.756
- Nope.
- Uh!

32:39.792 --> 32:41.324
- And one guy sobbed
like a little baby.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.393
Ah. I hate when they do that.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.663
Look, we blew up stockwood's
main distro system.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.866
We just gotta bide our time.
Someone will eventually crack.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.734
- Yeah and then,
randy bowen will be gone.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.936
- Well...
- Happy Friday, wazowski.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.739
Oh, hey!

32:55.808 --> 32:59.542
Wasn't today the day that you
said you were gonna find bowen?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.377
That's a tough break, kid.
(clears throat): Well,

33:01.413 --> 33:03.346
Thank you for
the fake support, hamm.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.948
- Oh, I believe you mean to say,
"thanks for the fake support,

33:05.985 --> 33:08.185
Detective sergeant hamm."

33:08.187 --> 33:10.487
Search and seizure,
ritz motors.

33:10.489 --> 33:11.755
This reptile crate.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.957
Close to three hundred grand
in the safe,

33:14.026 --> 33:15.258
And our runner...
(snaps fingers)

33:15.260 --> 33:16.460
...Had a half-key on him.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.228
- Wait. Please tell me
that it's empty.

33:18.363 --> 33:19.763
- No. It's not.

33:19.832 --> 33:22.766
Actually, what we, uh,
have here...

33:22.768 --> 33:26.770
Is, uh... An incomplete shed.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.505
Uh, the poor thing
must've been sick.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.773
- What makes you say that?

33:30.943 --> 33:32.842
- I've been trying to get over
my ophidiophobia,

33:32.878 --> 33:36.113
So I've been doing a ton
of research on snakes.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.881
- Duff! Randy bowen had a snake.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.383
The amoxicillin
in the car...

33:40.419 --> 33:42.152
Yes! Okay, that is why

33:42.287 --> 33:44.320
Hamm couldn't find the doctor
that prescribed it.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.023
- 'cause maybe it was a vet.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.458
- How could you let this happen?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.193
The ritz was clean,
it was working!

33:52.131 --> 33:53.729
You got the money out, right?
- No!

33:53.766 --> 33:55.165
The cops got everything.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.732
- What are you saying?

33:56.769 --> 33:58.401
- Everything gonna be fine,
alright?

33:58.470 --> 34:00.070
We just need a few days,
that's it.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.206
- A few days to get
two hundred grand?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.075
How you planning
on pulling that off?

34:05.210 --> 34:07.477
- Look, I diversified,
alright?

34:07.513 --> 34:08.879
I invested in the molly.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.881
I told you, synthetics
are the way of the future.

34:11.016 --> 34:14.284
And this nelson lam guy's
stuff is grade-a.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.219
Here. You should try some.

34:16.255 --> 34:19.289
Just to loosen up a little bit.
You're stressing me out.

34:21.493 --> 34:25.895
And tell layna, mercedes needs
to have plenty of fluids.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.364
- Where the hell are you going?

34:27.366 --> 34:28.431
- What do you mean?

34:28.500 --> 34:29.833
I'm going underground
for a few days

34:29.835 --> 34:31.902
Until we get
misiano's money sorted out.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.970
- Don't you dare leave me
with this mess on my hands.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.173
Hey! Goddammit,
turn around right now!

34:36.308 --> 34:38.241
- What am I gonna do
sitting here, tig?

34:38.376 --> 34:40.143
I need to go on the streets.

34:45.651 --> 34:46.817
- Nice day, huh?

34:48.186 --> 34:50.320
- Bill.
What are you doing here?

34:50.322 --> 34:52.856
- You said you'd have
my money by Friday.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.457
It's Friday!

34:54.493 --> 34:57.860
Thought I'd save you the trouble
of... Bringing it to me.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.333
(bill): Huh.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.236
- Nope.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.703
- Hey.
- Huh?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.272
- This clinic filled
a prescription for amoxicillin

35:09.274 --> 35:11.674
Last week, for one
antonio montana!

35:11.710 --> 35:13.710
(sighing): So randy
likes scarface.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.878
(chuckling)

35:14.880 --> 35:16.946
Guess we all have
our aspirations.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.482
- Yeah, and ours
is about to be realized.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.884
Mouth rot. Oh my gosh!

35:20.886 --> 35:22.451
Poor little thing, did he happen
to leave an address?

35:23.889 --> 35:25.155
Yes! Thank you so much,

35:25.290 --> 35:26.356
You're so wonderful!
- Yes!

35:26.358 --> 35:28.091
- You're like,
the best vet ever!

35:28.093 --> 35:31.294
- So, I dropped by
ritz motors today.

35:32.631 --> 35:37.400
I wanted to see with my own eyes
tiggy's "brand-new system."

35:37.402 --> 35:40.570
Going gangbusters, right?
That's what you told me.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.405
Thing is...

35:43.642 --> 35:47.710
The place...
Was just crawling with cops.

35:47.746 --> 35:48.778
Yeah, like...

35:49.781 --> 35:51.181
...Cockroaches.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.318
(exhaling abruptly)

35:55.453 --> 35:58.221
This is...
This is awkward, right?

36:01.260 --> 36:04.995
- Alright, look, bill... Okay...

36:05.130 --> 36:08.331
This is just a minor setback,
we'll recover everything.

36:08.466 --> 36:09.399
And you're gonna get
your money,

36:09.534 --> 36:10.667
You just gotta chill out--

36:10.669 --> 36:13.002
- You know what I like
about women

36:13.071 --> 36:16.273
Is they don't have machismo.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.875
Women have marianismo.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.176
Sounds italian, right?

36:20.212 --> 36:22.612
I think it's actually spanish,
I'm not sure.

36:22.747 --> 36:25.748
Either way,
it's the opposite.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.752
"purity and moral strength."

36:28.887 --> 36:33.623
Moral strength. Now, we know
most women... Ain't pure,

36:33.625 --> 36:36.392
We know the majority of women
don't have moral strength,

36:36.461 --> 36:38.628
But at least
you don't have machismo.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.965
(whispering): That's why
I was rooting for you.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.902
I was rooting for you.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.371
I usually have good instincts.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.974
My grandmother was psychic.
(randy): Really?

36:50.976 --> 36:52.808
That's actually cool.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.078
I mean, I-I think I'm psychic
sometimes, to be honest.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.184
I mean... It's like I can
see things comin--

37:01.319 --> 37:02.385
(gunshot)
(grunting)

37:02.520 --> 37:04.420
(tiggy gasps and screams,
loud sob)

37:04.456 --> 37:06.256
- Did you see that coming?

37:06.325 --> 37:08.858
Could you feel that coming?

37:08.860 --> 37:12.995
(sobbing): Bill, please!
Please, you don't wanna do this!

37:13.031 --> 37:15.131
- Technically,
this isn't my job.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.001
It's beneath me now.

37:18.003 --> 37:19.469
But my ma,

37:19.538 --> 37:21.671
She always said, my ma,

37:21.740 --> 37:23.873
"you've gotta clean up
after your messes."

37:23.942 --> 37:26.876
I mean, not literally.
Just an expression, you know?

37:26.945 --> 37:28.377
I mean, I got people
for this.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.746
- It was randy.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.081
Randy is the one who left
the money at ritz, okay?

37:32.117 --> 37:36.019
Not me, I was good,
we were good, I had a plan...

37:36.088 --> 37:38.621
- Ah, yeah!
(whimpering)

37:38.624 --> 37:40.756
Ah yeah, that's machismo.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.491
All day long.
(tiggy sobs): Don't.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.726
- I kinda like this one.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.028
It's nice.
(tig): Please, please,

37:45.030 --> 37:46.963
I'm begging you!
(sobbing)

37:47.098 --> 37:48.631
Please!

37:48.700 --> 37:50.600
- Don't make me out to be
the bad guy, tiggy.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.635
Don't do it.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.836
I took a chance on you.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.571
I thought you were
something.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.207
I'm sorry, kid.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.909
I really am.
- Just wait.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.244
You want your money, right?

38:05.917 --> 38:08.785
Best mdma money can buy.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.722
Complete grade-a,
that's all I'm hearing.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.457
Synthetics is the future, right?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.994
I just made
a brand-new connection.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.396
- Who?

38:19.398 --> 38:21.163
- It's this nelson lam guy.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.899
Listen...

38:24.936 --> 38:27.803
We start running drugs
both ways,

38:27.839 --> 38:29.873
Coke coming in,

38:30.008 --> 38:32.408
This stuff going out,

38:32.544 --> 38:36.412
I can get you your money
and double it by next month.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.014
Just please...

38:39.818 --> 38:44.554
Let me finish... The deal.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.432
<i> Caucasian, 39 years old.</i>

38:56.568 --> 38:58.568
<i> Known member of th--</i>
- detective tara swallows,

38:58.637 --> 39:00.236
Homicide.
Who found the body?

39:00.305 --> 39:01.837
- That'd be me, detective
wazowski, guns and gangs,

39:01.873 --> 39:03.606
We've met a few times before.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.008
- How many times
we gonna do this?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.509
Detective kelly duff,
drug squad.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.044
- Forgive me, I've got
a lot on my mind,

39:08.179 --> 39:09.779
My job's... Kind of
important.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.449
- Right. Whereas our jobs
aren't important at all.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.318
- Well, at least you know.

39:16.454 --> 39:18.587
- That was sarcasm.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.857
It's called sarcasm!
- You know what?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.692
(cell phone vibrating)
(sighing): Those two...

39:26.198 --> 39:28.264
- Duff?
- What's up?

39:28.300 --> 39:30.333
- They made the decision
about the ds job.

39:30.468 --> 39:33.803
- Oh! Right.
Today is Friday. Yeah.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.872
Decision day all around.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.075
Well, hey, look,
good thing is...

39:39.077 --> 39:41.344
You can tell 'em
you found randy.

39:41.413 --> 39:44.147
Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.
Have a good night.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.620
(bottles clinking)

39:50.622 --> 39:52.422
(jackie sighs)

39:52.557 --> 39:54.357
- Hi.
- Aunt layna?

39:56.227 --> 39:59.695
We kinda have a...
A favour to ask you.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.165
- What?

40:07.773 --> 40:10.707
- I really need you to wipe
elliot's fingerprints

40:10.842 --> 40:13.176
Off of that gun.
- Aw, sweetie,

40:13.311 --> 40:15.110
I did that already.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.712
The minute he wasn't looking.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.114
- Are you serious?

40:18.984 --> 40:20.416
- Yeah. Randy's a bully,

40:20.452 --> 40:22.318
But it's 'cause
he can't trust anybody.

40:22.354 --> 40:25.621
(jackie, relieved): Oh.
- So... It's fine. You're fine.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.424
(elliot sighs)

40:28.493 --> 40:29.792
(door opening)

40:29.795 --> 40:31.761
(jackie): Oh!
(door closes)

40:31.763 --> 40:32.862
(blowing)

40:36.334 --> 40:37.734
- My god, tiggy!

40:38.536 --> 40:39.668
What happened to you?

40:40.472 --> 40:41.738
Was it randy?

40:41.873 --> 40:42.972
Where is he?

40:44.810 --> 40:45.608
- Randy's dead.

40:48.546 --> 40:49.745
- Randy's what?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.347
- Bill killed him.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.549
And he'll kill me too,

40:53.685 --> 40:55.551
He'll kill all of us.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.755
I promised bill
if he didn't kill me,

40:58.757 --> 41:01.924
I'd deliver on that
stupid mdma deal randy made.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.428
I don't even know who the hell
this nelson guy is.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.430
Uh...

41:09.701 --> 41:10.766
That's okay.

41:12.437 --> 41:13.369
We do.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.473
(hip-hop music)

41:18.777 --> 41:20.443
(door opens)

41:24.849 --> 41:26.448
(hamm exhales loudly)

41:26.485 --> 41:27.850
- He looks unhappy.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.519
Am I bad for hoping
that he's unhappy?

41:29.654 --> 41:32.354
- I don't know, but you can
let go of my finger.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.190
Just get in there already.
- Yeah.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.391
How does she look?

41:35.393 --> 41:36.659
- Like she's waiting for you.
- Okay.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.461
- You got it.
- Yeah.

41:38.596 --> 41:39.895
(whispering): You got this.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.803
- Kelly duff. This night
gets better and better.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.871
- Well, well, well.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.541
Ditched your
Friday night, huh?

41:51.543 --> 41:54.544
Yeah, it looks a
little desperate, but...

41:54.546 --> 41:57.346
Lucky for you, you...
Wear it well.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.649
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.684
- And actually,
I didn't... Ditch her.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.354
But I can,
if you're saying that...

42:07.058 --> 42:08.357
(kelly sighs)
(sam, muffled): What?

42:09.561 --> 42:11.427
(shanks, muffled): Okay, good.
(kelly): Ah, damn!

42:11.429 --> 42:12.661
She didn't get it.

42:13.798 --> 42:14.831
- Detective green.
- Do you know how annoying

42:14.966 --> 42:17.033
She's about to be?
- You can come on in.

42:17.102 --> 42:18.367
- I was gonna tell you,

42:18.403 --> 42:20.303
But I didn't want to jinx it.
- Hold on! Wait.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.572
You went out for the ds job?

42:22.707 --> 42:25.041
Wazowski's job? And you didn't
think to mention it to me?

42:25.176 --> 42:26.576
- We can talk about it
over dinner...

42:26.711 --> 42:29.779
- No. Why don't you save it
for your new Friday night?

42:30.715 --> 42:33.882
(r&b music)

42:47.265 --> 42:50.232
- I didn't get it.
- Yeah, I gathered.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.271
Wanna get drunk?

42:57.809 --> 43:01.344
- Yeah.
(softly): Come on. Okay.

43:01.479 --> 43:05.281
Oh, let's go get drunk, okay?
- Okay, I have to get my coat.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.749
- Okay, we can go get it.

43:06.751 --> 43:07.750
(sam sighs)

43:07.786 --> 43:08.884
(kelly): Think about it
this way,

43:08.886 --> 43:09.885
You get one more day
with me.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.020
- Yeah, 'cause we're
friends now.

43:11.155 --> 43:12.888
- Nah. No, we're not, really.
- Okay.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.223
- Just for today.
