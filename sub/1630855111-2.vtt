19:58.958 --> 20:01.166
<i>Listen, the X Case
was just the beginning.</i>

20:01.166 --> 20:02.416
Manticore is readying for

20:02.416 --> 20:04.416
something cataclysmic,
an endgame.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.000
So the only way
I get to see my family again

20:06.000 --> 20:08.125
- is if we stop them.
- Precisely.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.083
We are two guys in a van
with a briefcase, Bernard.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.208
We're the plot
of <i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>

20:12.208 --> 20:15.000
What's your big plan?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.250
I don't know.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.750
- You don't know?
- No.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.708
What happened to the tech
fucking genius Atlas destined

20:20.708 --> 20:23.083
- to carry the world
on his back guy?
- I don't know, okay?

20:23.083 --> 20:25.208
- But Mason will.
- And I'm not Mason.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.291
No. Not yet.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.833
Step on it.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.666
What do you mean, "Not yet"?

20:34.666 --> 20:37.333
Stored in that case
are his memories.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.583
- Your memories.
- What?

20:39.583 --> 20:41.875
Every Citadel spy has a chip
placed in their temporal lobe.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.500
That chip uploads your memories
to a Citadel server.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.750
If we can no longer trace you,
we backstop you.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.083
You erase our memories.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.708
Got him. There he is.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.541
But that vial right there,
the one with your name on it,

20:54.541 --> 20:57.208
it can give you
your memories back.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.583
Be careful with it.
It's the only one.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.875
- How do I...?
- Just press it into your neck,

21:08.875 --> 21:10.291
and the fluid runs
into your bloodstream.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.708
Are you fucking with me?

21:13.791 --> 21:14.791
Steady.

21:15.833 --> 21:17.083
Don't you trust me?

21:19.708 --> 21:22.375
Absolutely not.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.041
Do it.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.083
No, no. Hey, Bernard.

21:36.375 --> 21:37.791
No, no, no, no, Bernard.

21:57.208 --> 21:59.416
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

22:10.250 --> 22:12.625
Drop that gun! Hey!

22:12.625 --> 22:14.791
I said drop the gun now!

22:28.500 --> 22:30.291
Track Mason.
Find out where he's heading.

22:30.291 --> 22:32.333
<i>Copy that.</i>

22:32.333 --> 22:37.375
Something unexpected
just fell in my lap.

23:03.625 --> 23:07.041
Fuck! Fuck!

23:43.458 --> 23:46.791
<i>"He had the reddest hair
Finn had ever seen.</i>

23:46.791 --> 23:49.500
It was redder than a cherry.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.875
Redder than a fire engine.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.375
And as if that wasn't
enough color for one person,

23:53.375 --> 23:56.416
he had a matching beard
full of it, too."

24:03.458 --> 24:05.500
<i>This is Abby.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

24:05.500 --> 24:07.208
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

24:08.250 --> 24:10.250
Hey.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.791
I'm on a plane
headed for Valencia.

24:13.833 --> 24:17.625
<i>I know that wasn't the plan,
but they're coming for me,</i>

24:17.625 --> 24:21.250
<i>and I can't come back
or they'll find you, too.</i>

24:21.250 --> 24:24.250
<i>The only person who can help me
is in Spain.</i>

24:24.250 --> 24:26.000
<i>A Citadel spy.</i>

24:26.000 --> 24:28.416
<i>I have to find them
to find a way out,</i>

24:28.416 --> 24:31.166
<i>to keep us safe.</i>

24:31.166 --> 24:34.041
<i>Just know that I love you,
all right?</i>

24:34.041 --> 24:36.375
<i>Both of you.</i>

24:36.375 --> 24:39.125
<i>You're all that matter to me.</i>

25:31.583 --> 25:32.875
Do you have a reservation?

25:32.875 --> 25:34.333
I'm meeting a friend.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.666
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me, sir. Are you okay?

25:49.083 --> 25:50.208
You're Nadia.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.833
<i>Perdón.</i> I think
you have the wrong person.

25:52.833 --> 25:54.166
I don't.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.750
I don't have the wrong person.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.583
<i>Señor,</i> you have a good night.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.791
Eight years ago. Italy.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.958
You remember what happened?

26:19.750 --> 26:21.458
Not here.

26:36.416 --> 26:39.291
I just woke up there.
He was already dead.

26:39.291 --> 26:41.166
- It had to be self-defense.
- What are you talking about?

26:41.166 --> 26:42.750
I didn't kill him.
He-he was dead.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.375
I'm not... I'm not the police.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.625
Then who the fuck are you?

26:51.208 --> 26:52.708
Mason Kane.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.833
Top spy. Hot stuff.

27:01.208 --> 27:03.166
I'm just...

27:06.041 --> 27:07.583
Bernard Orlick.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.541
Manticore.

27:09.541 --> 27:11.541
The X Case.
Any of that ring a bell?

27:11.541 --> 27:13.208
You really need to get
out of my way, buddy.

27:13.208 --> 27:14.875
They wiped your memories.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.333
I was on a train
eight years ago in Italy.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.791
There was an explosion.
I was pulled from the water.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.125
I couldn't remember who I was
or how I got there.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.583
You were on that train with me.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.333
- No.
- You were a spy,

27:25.333 --> 27:28.416
like me, for an organization
called Citadel.

27:28.416 --> 27:30.250
I don't know what you're on,
but I'm gonna

27:30.250 --> 27:31.583
walk past you,
through that door,

27:31.583 --> 27:33.541
and if you touch me,
I'm gonna scream, okay?

27:33.541 --> 27:35.416
Catch.

27:36.875 --> 27:38.416
Did you just throw
a knife at me?

27:38.416 --> 27:40.250
I thought
you were gonna catch it.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.125
See, Bernard did it to me,

27:42.125 --> 27:43.666
and-and I thought
you were gonna catch it,

27:43.666 --> 27:45.958
and then I was gonna be like,
"Then how come you can do that?"

27:45.958 --> 27:47.791
- Hey, hey, you better back up.
You better back up.
- I'm sorry. That is my bad.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.333
- I am backing up.
- No. That's not backing up.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.625
- I am backing up.
- Back up!

27:50.625 --> 27:52.083
Nadia Sinh.

27:52.083 --> 27:54.541
<i>Tier-One
Operator identified.</i>

27:56.916 --> 27:58.375
All right?

28:08.625 --> 28:10.625
- That's...
- You.

28:22.416 --> 28:24.500
Ladies and gentlemen.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.500
Get the fuck out of here now!

28:26.500 --> 28:28.416
<i>¡Andale! ¡Andale!</i>

28:28.416 --> 28:30.500
Kane is here. Find him.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.458
That vial there,
that one with your name on it,

28:37.458 --> 28:38.666
you inject it into your neck.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.458
It'll bring back your memories.

28:40.458 --> 28:41.916
You'll remember everything.

28:47.416 --> 28:49.750
Tell me you've never felt like
you should be somewhere else,

28:49.750 --> 28:51.833
doing something else.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.750
Tell me you've never seen
my face before.

28:56.791 --> 28:58.541
'Cause I've seen yours
for months.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.916
All right,
that was a warning shot.

29:08.916 --> 29:10.250
- Give me the case.
- It's yours.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.875
- It's all yours, buddy.
Take it.
- Put it down!

29:11.875 --> 29:13.125
I'm gonna put it down.
I'm putting it down.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.416
- Put it down.
- I'm putting...

29:20.291 --> 29:22.125
I have seen you before.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.291
In a dream.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.666
Come on.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.750
Now what?

29:37.875 --> 29:39.666
Nadia fucking Sinh.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.333
Stay down.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.958
Hey, look at me.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.041
Remember my brother?

29:55.041 --> 29:57.333
He says hello.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.375
Sorry.

30:08.416 --> 30:11.375
In the fucking back, Nadia?

30:11.375 --> 30:12.458
Really?

30:14.416 --> 30:16.541
Okay, then.

30:16.541 --> 30:17.625
Let's go.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.291
Him, I need alive.

30:24.291 --> 30:25.958
You, not so much.

30:27.583 --> 30:28.583
- Where you going?
- No, please.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.125
Come here. Come here.

30:30.125 --> 30:32.041
Get up, Sinh.
What's wrong with you, huh?

30:32.041 --> 30:34.500
Why aren't you fighting back?

30:34.500 --> 30:37.583
Been too long, huh?
Forgot how to fight, huh, Nadia?

30:44.500 --> 30:46.625
You dumb bitch.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.291
You should've stayed dead.

30:52.166 --> 30:53.583
You're here for me, asshole.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.791
Yeah, that's right!

30:56.791 --> 30:59.166
It's always about you, huh?

30:59.166 --> 31:02.208
Isn't it? Huh? Huh?

31:02.208 --> 31:04.958
It's always about Kane.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.375
Isn't it?

31:09.666 --> 31:11.666
You got it now.

31:21.583 --> 31:23.625
You dumb bitch.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.625
You're gonna wish I was dead.

31:59.666 --> 32:01.416
Come on.

32:03.166 --> 32:05.458
Put pressure on it.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.166
Did you do it?

32:12.166 --> 32:14.208
Yeah.

32:16.375 --> 32:19.125
I thought Mason was dead.

32:20.166 --> 32:21.833
You remember.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.125
I remember everything.

32:28.666 --> 32:31.375
Mason can never find out.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.833
We got to go.

32:48.833 --> 32:51.250
- Do you have him?
- <i>I need more time.</i>

32:51.250 --> 32:52.250
Why?

32:52.250 --> 32:54.416
He wasn't alone.

32:54.416 --> 32:56.083
He was with Nadia Sinh.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.083
How is this possible?

32:58.083 --> 33:00.041
What the fuck is going on here?!

33:00.041 --> 33:01.791
I don't know.

33:01.791 --> 33:04.583
Your dipshit of a brother
was in charge of

33:04.583 --> 33:07.666
scouring Orlick's tech
for any sign of survivors.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.000
Yeah, and he did.
We didn't find anything.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.083
<i>You said he had it handled.</i>

33:14.291 --> 33:17.583
Well, lucky for you,
your gift just arrived.

33:17.583 --> 33:20.250
<i>I want Kane here by nightfall.</i>

33:20.250 --> 33:21.916
Yes, ma'am.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.916
I'm so glad you pulled through.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.208
Was touch and go there
for a bit.

33:33.541 --> 33:36.875
We'll find Kane
and the X Case shortly.

33:36.875 --> 33:38.666
I have no doubt.

33:40.208 --> 33:43.250
But I'm an impatient woman.

33:43.250 --> 33:46.833
The kind of woman
who likes dessert for dinner.

33:48.041 --> 33:53.416
And there are a whole host
of delicious Citadel secrets

33:53.416 --> 33:56.500
we can extract from you
in the meantime.

33:59.791 --> 34:03.125
It's always nice
to reconnect with an old pal,

34:03.125 --> 34:04.833
isn't it, Bernard?

34:06.333 --> 34:08.333
And this will be fun.

34:09.583 --> 34:11.916
You know,
I'm exceptionally skilled

34:11.916 --> 34:15.208
at getting Citadel agents
to turn.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.291
Chin-chin.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.500
<i>Well, I found her--
the, uh, Citadel spy.</i>

34:28.500 --> 34:29.666
<i>She remembers everything.</i>

34:29.666 --> 34:31.291
- "She"?
- Her name's Nadia.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.125
- Were we together?
- Don't flatter yourself.

34:36.458 --> 34:37.541
Never?

34:38.625 --> 34:41.458
For a century,
you were creating a new order.

34:41.458 --> 34:44.166
<i>A Citadel spy betrayed you.</i>

34:45.458 --> 34:46.583
<i>Manticore is readying</i>

34:46.583 --> 34:47.875
<i>for something cataclysmic.</i>

34:47.875 --> 34:49.208
<i>An endgame.</i>

34:49.208 --> 34:51.291
- Teach me. Train me.
- You're not him.

34:51.291 --> 34:52.458
<i>I can be.</i>

34:52.458 --> 34:54.125
<i>They know we're alive.</i>

34:54.125 --> 34:56.625
<i>They're gonna come after us
with everything they've got.</i>

34:56.625 --> 34:58.000
<i>So we're about to kill
a bunch of people?</i>

34:58.000 --> 34:59.458
Not your first time, love.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.500
It was one of your own
who came to me.

35:05.958 --> 35:07.875
<i>You did this.</i>

35:11.125 --> 35:13.458
<i>We have
eyes everywhere.</i>

35:13.458 --> 35:15.666
We got to go. They found us.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.041
Stay with me.

35:17.041 --> 35:19.625
It gives me great pleasure
to do this.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.416
And this will be fun.
