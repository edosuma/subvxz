17:19.255 --> 17:20.909
Fuck you care?

17:20.996 --> 17:23.781
You ever meet this guy before?

17:23.867 --> 17:25.653
Why you in my business?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.005
How old are you?

17:30.092 --> 17:31.093
Really.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.924
I'm 17.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.191
Hm.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.209
Fuck you, man.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.004
Pick up. Pick up.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.876
J.J.,
where the fuck are you, man?

18:14.963 --> 18:16.704
I'm right behind you.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.880
I don't see you.
Hurry the fuck up!

18:18.967 --> 18:20.142
I said
I'll meet you at Lake City, man.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.013
Get the fuck out the road.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.319
I'm passing you now.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.929
Get to move. Move!

18:27.280 --> 18:28.890
Fuck, yeah.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.514
Freddy,
I'm almost at Lake City, bro.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.907
Hey, remember
that guy that patched up Reggie

19:29.994 --> 19:31.779
after he got shot by the cop?

19:31.866 --> 19:33.433
The vet?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.086
- The what?
- The dog guy, man.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.263
The veterinarian.
You know where he's at?

19:37.350 --> 19:39.439
No. I'll have to call Reg.
Why?

19:39.526 --> 19:40.918
You're gonna have to take me

19:41.005 --> 19:41.919
to go see him
after you pick me up.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.530
Yo, did you get shot?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.227
It's just a scratch.

19:45.314 --> 19:46.750
Then why you going to a vet?

19:46.837 --> 19:48.535
If it was serious,
I'd go to the hospital.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.363
Fuck you!
But then you'd go to jail!

19:50.450 --> 19:52.843
Just find the
fucking number, J.J. Fuck!

19:52.930 --> 19:54.149
All right. All right.
All right.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.672
I'll call Reggie now.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.854
Fuck.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.788
Lake City, Florida coming up.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.573
Anybody for Lake City, Florida?

20:31.969 --> 20:33.014
Yo.

20:34.494 --> 20:35.669
Yo.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.594
What's his name?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.422
The dude you're going to meet.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.556
Smokie.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.690
What's his real name?

21:01.521 --> 21:03.000
You don't know his real name?

21:07.222 --> 21:08.571
You know what he looks like?

21:10.921 --> 21:12.793
Now answer this question
honestly.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.447
How old are you?

21:14.534 --> 21:18.189
Why do you keep asking me that?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.583
Does he know how old you are?

21:20.670 --> 21:21.976
Smokie?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.327
What'd you tell him?

21:25.414 --> 21:28.025
Twenty-one?

21:28.112 --> 21:30.419
He knows how old I am.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.477
Your parents know where you are?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.038
Freddy? I'm here, man.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.562
I got that vet's number.
What bus are you on?

22:26.649 --> 22:29.478
I just pulled up. Hold tight.

22:29.565 --> 22:30.784
All right.

22:32.612 --> 22:33.656
Lake City, folks.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.092
Anyone for Lake City?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.187
Take care of yourself.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.885
Like you give a shit.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.719
Move, dumbass.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.024
Dumbass.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.852
Fuckers.

23:04.948 --> 23:05.993
Fuck.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.391
Son of a bitch.

23:49.732 --> 23:50.907
On or off?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.259
On or off?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.310
You sick or something?

24:04.007 --> 24:05.531
Like you give a shit.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.871
Next stop's
gonna be Valdosta.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.394
Where is he?

24:58.148 --> 24:59.585
Where's Freddy, J.J.?

24:59.672 --> 25:00.629
I haven't see him.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.630
Lie! It's a lie.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.026
Call Coco.

25:10.378 --> 25:12.162
We got J.J.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.903
Good. Hurry up then.

25:13.990 --> 25:14.991
They got him.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.166
In Lake City.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.692
Hm.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.240
Next stop, Valdosta.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.371
Valdosta.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.500
Who is it?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.937
It's Freddy.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.941
You still in Valdosta?

26:35.028 --> 26:35.985
Yeah.

26:36.072 --> 26:37.987
So what?

26:38.074 --> 26:39.249
I need some help.

26:40.773 --> 26:41.817
I'm busy.

26:47.257 --> 26:48.911
I just need
a ride somewhere, man.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.870
Get a cab.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.872
I can't do that.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.918
Why not?

26:58.660 --> 27:00.836
Because I'm in trouble.

27:03.447 --> 27:04.579
Please.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.277
Please who?

27:07.364 --> 27:08.539
What?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.411
Please who?

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
Just say it.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.241
Fuck you, I--

27:33.477 --> 27:35.958
Damn.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.657
You are fucked up.

27:44.967 --> 27:45.968
Fuck.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.119
Stop. Fucking. Calling. Me.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.598
Chrissy, I got money.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.122
Jesus.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.515
It's for Lily. Please.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.648
Hah. You missed
13 years of payments,

28:13.735 --> 28:15.302
you wanna be a daddy now?

28:15.389 --> 28:16.999
I can
pay it all back right now.

28:17.086 --> 28:19.828
So now
you wanna play grownups.
Where'd you get it?

28:19.915 --> 28:21.917
That's not important.

28:22.004 --> 28:23.919
You stole it.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.312
Didn't you?

28:25.399 --> 28:27.227
I'm shot. I've been shot.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.490
There's a fucking bullet
in my stomach, Chrissy.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.975
Please.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.020
I'm fucking begging you, please.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.805
Fuck, I'm scared, Christine.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.591
What do you want me to do, huh?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.462
Go ask Vic.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.855
That whore.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.253
Fuck.

29:09.530 --> 29:13.664
It's a parole violation for me
to associate with known felons.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.276
Look, I just need a ride
to the hospital.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.886
I can't drive you.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.845
I lost my license.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.890
Even if I wanted
to help you I can't.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.239
Anything else?

29:23.326 --> 29:24.893
Don't hang up.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.853
Then say it.

29:33.989 --> 29:37.471
Dad.

29:37.558 --> 29:40.953
Don't hang up, Dad.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.957
Now, see?

29:45.044 --> 29:47.916
That wasn't so hard now,
was it?

29:48.003 --> 29:50.571
So you're in trouble, huh?

29:50.658 --> 29:52.007
I've been shot.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.313
Hm.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.837
You don't sound shot.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.100
I got some money, too.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.538
Hm. Is that why you're shot?

30:03.279 --> 30:05.107
Yeah.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.414
Who'd you knock off? Vic?

30:07.501 --> 30:09.285
Oh, man.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.462
You are once special kinda
fuckup, you know that?

30:12.549 --> 30:15.552
So I guess I'm the only one
that can help you, am I right?

30:15.639 --> 30:17.511
Are you still in Valdosta?

30:17.598 --> 30:19.295
You already asked me that.

30:19.382 --> 30:20.688
Well, are you?

30:22.342 --> 30:24.300
Fuck. Pft.

30:29.218 --> 30:30.959
So fucking...

31:08.954 --> 31:10.738
Holy shit!

31:14.002 --> 31:14.960
Chrissy.

31:15.047 --> 31:15.961
When?

31:16.048 --> 31:17.614
When were you shot?

31:17.701 --> 31:19.225
About an hour ago.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.922
Is there an exit wound?

31:26.928 --> 31:28.321
I don't think so.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.540
Jesus. How much blood
have you lost?

31:30.627 --> 31:31.802
A lot.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.760
What's a lot?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.936
I don't know. A pint?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.982
- You need a hospital.
- I can't.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.374
I can't do that.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.768
-Where are you?
-I'm on a bus to Cairo.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.596
Look, my hospital's not far
from there.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.554
- Can-- can you get a cab?
- I need the chart.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.382
- I need you to get all the files.
-  -Shit.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.775
- How long
do I got before I bleed out?

31:47.862 --> 31:48.994
I can't tell over the phone.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.212
Morgan, I need that chart ASAP!

31:50.299 --> 31:51.561
Yeah, coming, Doctor.

31:51.648 --> 31:52.606
Freddy,
I can't make a diagnosis...

31:52.693 --> 31:54.651
Pressure's dropping.

31:54.738 --> 31:55.914
... but if you've
lost a pint of blood.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.393
Nurse, get that chart!

31:57.480 --> 31:59.787
Morgan! You dropped the ball.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.489
Look, just get to the hospital.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.274
I'll treat you in my car
in the parking lot,

32:08.361 --> 32:10.058
that way we won't have to
register you.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.625
But if you need surgery.

32:11.712 --> 32:14.541
You know what? I don't.

32:14.628 --> 32:15.977
Okay.

32:16.064 --> 32:17.892
You need to stop the bleeding.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.373
Direct pressure
is how you do that.

32:20.460 --> 32:23.028
You need to get a cloth
or something absorbent.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.594
I gotta go.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.031
Just get to the hospital

32:26.118 --> 32:27.075
and make sure
you don't pass out.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.779
Hey.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.869
Do you have a pad?

32:38.957 --> 32:42.003
Like a... like a tampon?

32:42.090 --> 32:44.136
What?

32:44.223 --> 32:45.354
Please.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.921
Oh, shit.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.053
Please.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.888
[Freddy Thank you.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.760
You got sliced?

32:59.847 --> 33:00.891
Shot.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.113
You a gangster?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.636
Yep.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.116
Don't tell no one.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.648
Well, if you a
gangster, why are you on a bus?

33:18.735 --> 33:21.738
Wasn't my intention initially.

33:21.825 --> 33:23.479
What'd you do?

33:23.566 --> 33:25.481
I took something
that doesn't belong to me.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.619
Can I use your phone then?

33:32.706 --> 33:34.534
Why?

33:34.621 --> 33:36.405
So you can call that guy?

33:36.492 --> 33:39.930
Yeah. So what?

33:43.499 --> 33:44.805
Fine.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.853
Take it.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.168
Don't pass out.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.692
You pass out,
we ain't waking back up.

34:06.522 --> 34:07.741
Hi.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.051
What do you want, man?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.661
Do you know that girl?

34:14.748 --> 34:15.966
What?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.489
She's just a kid, dude.

34:17.577 --> 34:21.275
Whoa.

34:21.362 --> 34:23.713
You got the wrong idea,
my friend.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.065
I hope so.

34:28.978 --> 34:30.284
Are you a cop?

34:35.377 --> 34:38.989
That's a guilty thing to ask.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.993
My name's Will.
I work in Social Services.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.561
You don't look
like a social worker.

34:45.648 --> 34:51.132
Well, we come
in all shapes and sizes.

34:51.219 --> 34:54.092
Why the fuck
is a social worker taking a bus?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.532
Is that a real question
you want an answer to?

35:02.622 --> 35:04.754
Look, man,
she asked to borrow my phone.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.843
I gave it to her.
I ain't bothering her.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.106
Hm.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.328
Are we gonna have a problem?

35:18.507 --> 35:22.816
No. No problem.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.992
I had to check.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.254
I checked.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.191
Hello?

35:50.278 --> 35:52.280
She remind you of someone?

35:57.285 --> 35:59.287
Yup.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.506
There goes another little girl

36:00.593 --> 36:03.726
your sorry ass let down.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.772
You're making a habit of this.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.516
Hey, psst, what's the plan?

36:12.996 --> 36:15.129
The plan, the plan, the plan.
Come on, man.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.610
Lily.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.568
Bingo.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.528
Get you patched up,
we'll stick to the plan.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.226
It's just you and me now.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.141
You and me.

36:49.032 --> 36:49.990
Freddy?

36:50.077 --> 36:51.774
Freddy, you there?

36:51.861 --> 36:54.081
You won't believe what the fuck
happened to me, man.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.909
So I got to Lake City,

36:55.996 --> 36:58.390
these motherfuckers straight up
jumped my ass, bro.

36:58.477 --> 37:03.482
Yeah? So what'd you do?

37:03.569 --> 37:05.919
They had knuckles up, bro.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.878
I got away.

37:08.965 --> 37:11.620
Are you still on the bus, man,
or d-- did you get off?

37:11.707 --> 37:12.969
Talk to me, man.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.323
Yeah, I'm still on the bus.

37:18.410 --> 37:19.585
I'mma come get you.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.151
When's your next stop?

37:22.327 --> 37:23.806
Fifteen minutes.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.550
Where you gonna be at?

37:30.770 --> 37:32.554
Pine Park.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.817
Pine Park. All right, cool.

37:34.904 --> 37:37.342
Sit tight, man.
I'm gonna come get you.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.138
Please.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.835
I'm gonna be real gentle.

38:18.644 --> 38:22.430
Chrissy,
I'm seeing shit.

38:22.517 --> 38:25.651
Visions. Fucked-up shit.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.174
You're becoming catatonic,

38:27.261 --> 38:29.263
probably going into shock.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.873
You said I needed blood.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.746
Like a transfusion?

38:33.833 --> 38:35.443
Can you get it?

38:35.530 --> 38:36.444
You're a rare blood type.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.751
That's a long shot.

38:38.838 --> 38:40.274
What are my chances?

38:40.361 --> 38:41.406
I'd call your father.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.495
I already did that.

38:43.582 --> 38:45.453
If you weren't shot,
would you have called me?

38:45.540 --> 38:48.456
I told you why I called you.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.718
Why now?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.767
Because I'm going away.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.249
This is it.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.251
You're always
running away, Freddy.

39:08.476 --> 39:09.521
The fuck.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.277
There he is.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.454
I need a transfusion.

39:29.541 --> 39:32.674
You want my blood?

39:32.761 --> 39:34.197
I'll pay you for it.

39:34.284 --> 39:36.112
I know you'll pay me.

39:36.199 --> 39:39.942
It ain't that. I hate needles.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.467
I'm fuckin' dying here, man!
Are you gonna help me or not?

40:17.502 --> 40:18.590
Phone.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.681
Phone!

40:50.448 --> 40:52.406
I told you I'm not
doing nothing, man.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.408
I know. I know.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.671
Then what do you want?

40:59.195 --> 41:00.762
Look, I can see
you're in some kind of trouble

41:00.849 --> 41:02.677
Back the fuck off, man.

41:02.764 --> 41:06.376
Hey, is she in trouble?
Is she running away? What?

41:08.248 --> 41:10.163
You okay?

41:10.250 --> 41:12.818
She's hooking up with some guy
she met online named Smokie.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.428
That's all I know.

41:16.430 --> 41:19.215
Smokie.

41:19.302 --> 41:21.435
Guess his last name's
The Bear or Robinson.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.437
I'm pretty sure
that's not his real name.

41:23.524 --> 41:26.875
How the hell would I know that?

41:26.962 --> 41:28.660
I can help her.

41:28.747 --> 41:31.532
Then why are you talking to me?

41:31.619 --> 41:33.795
Because I see she trusts you.

41:33.882 --> 41:35.449
I'm a stranger to her.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.059
Sometimes these kids,
they run the other way

41:37.146 --> 41:40.280
once they find
you're social services.

41:41.586 --> 41:43.631
But you could sway her.

41:43.718 --> 41:46.068
You could get her to talk to me
so I could help her.

41:46.155 --> 41:49.028
God, I don't have
time for that.

41:49.115 --> 41:51.030
You're on a bus.
What else you got to do?

41:53.249 --> 41:55.643
- I gotta take this.
- Hey.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.253
We gotta do somethin', man.
She's just a kid.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.560
You do something.
I gotta take this.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.301
Just talk to her.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.781
I already have.

42:02.868 --> 42:04.173
Then tell her
not to meet that guy.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.958
Come on, man.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.308
Okay, how about this?
Okay, I'll call my office.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.745
I'll tell them to come pick us
up wherever she gets off.

42:10.832 --> 42:12.007
Make sure she gets home safe--

42:12.094 --> 42:13.182
All right. All right, man.

42:13.269 --> 42:14.662
I'll talk to her.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.535
Good.

42:21.190 --> 42:22.278
J.J.

42:24.019 --> 42:26.195
You're not
going to Pines Park.

42:26.282 --> 42:28.763
You stole from me. Freddy.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.548
You put my whole crew
on the line.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.376
Where's J.J.?

42:33.463 --> 42:34.639
I'm gonna have
to prove to the Puerto Ricans

42:34.726 --> 42:37.032
that I had no hand in this.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.557
Let me talk to him.

42:39.644 --> 42:42.560
I was warned not to trust you
with a shipment this size.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.649
Put J.J. on the phone.

42:44.736 --> 42:45.780
Okay.

42:52.439 --> 42:53.527
Freddy, Freddy, man.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.834
I... I didn't say anything, man.

42:55.921 --> 42:59.011
J.J., everything's cool, man.
It's all good.

42:59.098 --> 43:01.143
This is shit.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.757
Okay.

43:05.844 --> 43:07.715
We can make this right.

43:07.802 --> 43:09.151
Do you have the coke?

43:10.718 --> 43:12.720
Yeah.

43:12.807 --> 43:13.852
And the money?

43:13.939 --> 43:15.680
Yeah.

43:15.767 --> 43:17.072
All of it?

43:22.121 --> 43:23.775
All of it.

43:23.862 --> 43:25.341
Okay,
I'm gonna need to see you.

43:25.428 --> 43:26.473
Where you headed?

43:29.824 --> 43:31.521
I know you're hurting, okay?

43:31.609 --> 43:34.481
I got a doctor lined up.
We'll get you fixed up.

43:34.568 --> 43:36.222
Vic.

43:36.309 --> 43:39.094
I know, baby,
but they want blood.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.400
And they already got Mac.

43:42.794 --> 43:44.317
Please. Oh, my god.

43:44.404 --> 43:46.275
But Mac's not enough.

43:46.362 --> 43:47.886
You're right.

43:47.973 --> 43:48.930
Mac won't be enough.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.194
Please!

43:52.281 --> 43:53.282
- No.
- Hail Mary, full of grace,

43:53.369 --> 43:54.544
the Lord is with thee.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.981
Blessed art thou among women,

43:56.068 --> 43:57.591
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus

43:57.678 --> 43:58.766
Oh, God, Vic, please.

43:58.853 --> 44:00.028
Pray for us sinners now,

44:00.115 --> 44:01.508
and at the hour of our death.

44:03.771 --> 44:04.859
Our Father who art in heaven--

44:04.946 --> 44:07.253
Jesus, stop.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.081
Vic, stop. Please.

44:09.168 --> 44:10.735
And lead us
not into temptation

44:10.822 --> 44:11.779
but deliver us.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.520
J.J. Stop, Vic. Please.

44:22.007 --> 44:24.183
Fuck.

44:26.489 --> 44:30.363
Okay. We're all good now.

44:30.450 --> 44:33.627
You can come
back to the fold, baby.

44:33.714 --> 44:36.543
Everything
can be healthy again.

44:36.630 --> 44:39.502
Or I could pay Christine
and Lily a visit.

44:45.247 --> 44:47.772
Save yourself
a heart attack, man.

44:47.859 --> 44:49.643
God. Fuck.

44:49.730 --> 44:50.992
Mm. Fuck!

44:51.079 --> 44:53.168
Fuck! Fuck.

44:59.392 --> 45:01.524
It's fine.

45:01.611 --> 45:04.919
You just stabbed your employer
in the back twice.

45:11.665 --> 45:12.971
You fucked up.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.755
Get on it, goddammit!

45:14.842 --> 45:17.323
Get the money
to Christine and Lily.

45:21.283 --> 45:22.415
Fuck.

46:25.043 --> 46:27.872
Lily?

46:39.100 --> 46:40.667
Do you know that girl?

46:41.973 --> 46:43.888
She's just a kid, dude.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.282
Lily?

46:49.937 --> 46:52.505
Hey, do you mind?

46:52.592 --> 46:54.507
I'm trying to get
some shut-eye here.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.868
What the fuck, dude?.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.808
I got us a ride.

47:34.895 --> 47:36.810
Let's do this fucking thing.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.159
What changed?

47:38.246 --> 47:39.900
Nothing changed.

47:39.987 --> 47:41.946
Meet me at the
bus station in Valdosta.

47:42.033 --> 47:43.904
What time do you get in?

47:43.991 --> 47:45.558
Any minute.

47:45.645 --> 47:47.560
I know this guy at the bar,

47:47.647 --> 47:49.214
and he's gonna get us
where we need to go.

47:49.301 --> 47:51.042
Some guy in a bar is gonna

47:51.129 --> 47:52.739
drive us
fucking?

47:52.826 --> 47:54.784
What do you want,
a fucking horse and carriage?

47:54.872 --> 47:55.829
You still got the money?

47:55.916 --> 47:57.831
Yeah, I still got it.

47:57.918 --> 47:59.441
Five minutes.

48:12.324 --> 48:13.978
Valdosta, comin' up.

48:14.065 --> 48:15.718
Anybody for Valdosta?

48:21.072 --> 48:23.770
I don't want you
to meet that guy.

48:23.857 --> 48:26.207
I'm serious.

48:26.294 --> 48:28.949
Why are you trying to
give me shit on my life?

48:31.082 --> 48:32.300
Just don't meet him.

48:36.565 --> 48:38.872
You trippin'.

48:38.959 --> 48:40.352
Look.

48:41.962 --> 48:44.834
I've been in your position
before.

48:44.922 --> 48:49.709
Someone older gets in your head,
takes advantage of you.

48:51.841 --> 48:53.278
It's messed up.

48:58.544 --> 49:00.546
I want you to do
something for me.

49:02.635 --> 49:04.332
See that man over there?

49:07.335 --> 49:08.815
I want you to talk to him.

49:18.303 --> 49:20.740
He's gonna help you.

49:20.827 --> 49:22.263
I don't need help.

49:29.488 --> 49:30.968
Just hear him out, okay?

49:53.120 --> 49:55.340
Damn.

49:55.427 --> 49:56.776
Where's your guy?

49:56.863 --> 50:00.736
He ain't here yet.
Step off and let's wait.

50:00.823 --> 50:03.522
Said your guy from
the bar is gonna drive us.

50:03.609 --> 50:05.176
Where's your guy?

50:05.263 --> 50:09.354
He's on his way.
Now get off and we'll wait.

50:09.441 --> 50:12.444
On or off, son?
We gonna keep having this dance?

50:14.620 --> 50:17.231
I ain't waiting out there.

50:17.318 --> 50:19.494
You can't wait
five fucking minutes?

50:19.581 --> 50:21.018
All right, I'll get on with you.

50:23.150 --> 50:26.414
I'll tell my guy to meet us
at the next stop.

50:26.501 --> 50:28.068
Get your ticket at the station.

50:28.155 --> 50:30.375
What?

50:30.462 --> 50:32.116
You get your ticket
in the station.

50:33.421 --> 50:36.381
Like everybody else.

50:36.468 --> 50:38.948
I gotta get
my ticket in the station,

50:39.036 --> 50:41.038
just like everybody else.

50:46.521 --> 50:47.696
Go ahead.

50:47.783 --> 50:49.176
Much obliged.

50:52.745 --> 50:55.574
Hey, miss me that much?

50:55.661 --> 50:56.662
Put your headphones on.

50:58.968 --> 51:00.274
Who's this?

51:00.361 --> 51:02.015
Nobody.

51:02.102 --> 51:03.538
She's cute.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.062
You sure ain't.

51:25.517 --> 51:27.084
So where'd you get clipped?

51:30.261 --> 51:34.091
That's gotta hurt.

51:34.178 --> 51:37.790
Hey, forget Valdosta.

51:37.877 --> 51:38.878
Cairo.

51:38.965 --> 51:41.837
Cairo. Get that? Mm-hm.

51:41.924 --> 51:43.143
All right.

51:45.058 --> 51:47.060
Okay.

51:47.147 --> 51:49.671
So where's my guy taking us?

51:49.758 --> 51:51.456
Hm?

51:51.543 --> 51:52.674
Christine is going to meet us
in the parking lot

51:52.761 --> 51:53.893
where she works.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.722
Hm. You and her still a thing?

51:56.809 --> 51:58.506
She's just doing me a favor.

51:58.593 --> 51:59.942
Well, she's too good for you.

52:00.029 --> 52:01.727
Always came running back.

52:01.814 --> 52:04.077
Some chicks never learn
that the guys they're with

52:04.164 --> 52:06.166
are bad fuckin' news.

52:08.560 --> 52:10.170
I guess Mom did.

52:14.609 --> 52:15.871
Psst. Hey.

52:15.958 --> 52:17.046
Cream pie.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.396
Where you going?

52:19.701 --> 52:21.399
What?

52:21.486 --> 52:23.357
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

52:23.444 --> 52:24.967
I'm just talking to her.

52:25.054 --> 52:26.099
How old are you anyway?

52:26.186 --> 52:27.448
Take a guess.

52:27.535 --> 52:28.710
Um, let's see.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.234
Stop bothering us.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.887
What do you...?
He was talking to me.

52:31.974 --> 52:34.890
Now he ain't,
so just turn around.

52:34.977 --> 52:36.153
What the fuck.

52:43.551 --> 52:45.379
So you pinch that
from Vic or what?

52:48.643 --> 52:50.645
Tell me what the fuck
you got me into or I'm out.

52:50.732 --> 52:51.907
What the fuck
did you get me into?

52:51.994 --> 52:53.344
It's Vic's.

52:56.825 --> 52:58.218
How much?

52:58.305 --> 53:00.133
Enough.

53:00.220 --> 53:03.180
Well, that's a ballsy move,
my friend.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.572
One you never made.

53:04.659 --> 53:05.965
Mm-hm.

53:06.052 --> 53:07.880
Why'd you take her shit?

53:07.967 --> 53:09.316
I needed out.

53:09.403 --> 53:11.362
Out? From what?

53:11.449 --> 53:13.146
From her.

53:13.233 --> 53:14.713
From all of this.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.672
I'm just gonna start
something of my own.

53:17.759 --> 53:19.152
And... and...

53:19.239 --> 53:20.936
And what?

53:21.023 --> 53:23.374
And there's something
for my daughter.

53:26.290 --> 53:29.293
Hm. Yeah. Oh, shit.

53:29.380 --> 53:32.078
The last time I saw her
was at... I don't know.

53:32.165 --> 53:34.907
Don't act like you remember.

53:34.994 --> 53:39.041
How old is Lily now, huh?

53:42.567 --> 53:44.482
She's 11.

53:44.569 --> 53:47.136
Hm. Eleven.

53:47.224 --> 53:50.444
Goddamn.

53:50.531 --> 53:52.664
You want to give her a future.
I get it, son.

53:52.751 --> 53:55.580
I get it. I do. That's--
that's-- that's noble on you.

53:55.667 --> 53:59.671
Shit, half a mill.
That'll do it, am I right?

54:05.024 --> 54:06.460
What did you just say?

54:08.375 --> 54:11.552
I don't know.
You told me how much.

54:11.639 --> 54:13.859
I didn't tell you shit.

54:13.946 --> 54:15.730
Well then,
how else would I know?

54:17.428 --> 54:18.516
You called her.

54:20.082 --> 54:22.607
You called Vic.

54:22.694 --> 54:24.217
You piece of shit.

54:24.304 --> 54:25.697
You told her where we're going.

54:27.176 --> 54:29.178
Let go, son. Let go.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.179
Let the fuck go.

54:37.143 --> 54:38.492
Okay.

54:38.579 --> 54:40.668
Whooh.

54:40.755 --> 54:45.499
We're just gonna sit here
quietly till we get to Cairo.

54:45.586 --> 54:47.980
Vic's going to meet us there,

54:48.067 --> 54:51.592
and she's gonna make
everything all right.

54:51.679 --> 54:54.639
Hey,

54:54.726 --> 54:55.944
what the fuck
are you looking at, huh?

54:56.031 --> 54:57.511
Excuse me?

54:57.598 --> 54:59.252
Why don't you turn
your fat ass around?

55:05.389 --> 55:09.044
I wish things didn't have
to go down like this. I do.

55:09.131 --> 55:13.135
I mean, it's-it's just the way
things are, I guess.

55:14.572 --> 55:16.095
Listen, you know I know
that I fucked up

55:16.182 --> 55:18.967
and I fessed up to that.

55:19.054 --> 55:22.231
I've had to live with
the choices that I have made.

55:22.319 --> 55:25.887
No. I've had to live
with the choices you made.

55:25.974 --> 55:29.238
You sold out your own son
so you can get back with Vic.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.501
Me and Vic are straight.

55:34.331 --> 55:38.247
Once, maybe.
When you worked for her.

55:38.335 --> 55:39.858
And then you let her take me
and seduce me

55:39.945 --> 55:41.860
as a fucking child.

55:41.947 --> 55:44.341
Hey, it got you
off that corner, right?

55:44.428 --> 55:46.125
You gotta start somewhere, boy.

55:46.212 --> 55:48.083
You shoulda protected me.

55:48.170 --> 55:51.130
Protected you?
Protected you from what?

55:51.217 --> 55:53.480
You-- you idolized Vic.

55:53.567 --> 55:55.569
She was like a mother to you.
I fucking gave you that.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.179
You didn't give me nothing.

55:57.266 --> 55:58.920
Oh, come the fuck off it.

55:59.007 --> 56:00.182
When the fuck
are you gonna start taking

56:00.269 --> 56:01.488
some fucking responsibility?

56:01.575 --> 56:02.968
You just gonna blame me
for everything

56:03.055 --> 56:04.143
in your motherfucking life?

56:04.230 --> 56:05.449
Do you know what she did to me?

56:05.536 --> 56:06.928
Do you know what she did to me?

56:11.585 --> 56:13.761
She kicked you out
because you were her bitch.

56:13.848 --> 56:16.024
You followed her around
like a little dog.

56:17.548 --> 56:19.506
Fuck you.

56:19.593 --> 56:21.334
-"I love you, Vic."
-Fuck you.

56:21.421 --> 56:22.814
-"I love you."
-Fuck you.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.732
She always wanted me over you

56:27.819 --> 56:29.603
and you hated me for it.

56:29.690 --> 56:33.868
This wasn't about the money.

56:33.955 --> 56:36.480
You did this
so you can get back with Vic.

56:38.351 --> 56:41.267
But she's not
gonna take you back.

56:41.354 --> 56:43.704
You're a rat.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.793
And Vic kills rats for fun.

56:49.667 --> 56:51.669
Fuck.

56:51.756 --> 56:55.412
At least I had the balls
to take something for myself,

56:55.499 --> 56:57.370
to start over.

56:57.457 --> 56:59.024
"Start over."

57:04.377 --> 57:06.771
Man, what the fuck
are you gonna start over?

57:08.425 --> 57:09.948
I've seen monkey shitfights
at the zoo

57:10.035 --> 57:12.080
that are more organized
than you.

57:12.167 --> 57:14.909
I didn't do anything wrong.

57:14.996 --> 57:18.826
Fuck me. You're a fake.

57:18.913 --> 57:21.307
Everything about you is fake.

57:22.526 --> 57:25.224
Your gold chain is fake.

57:25.311 --> 57:27.618
Your fucking Timex is fake.

57:27.705 --> 57:29.489
That is a real Timex.

57:39.499 --> 57:40.935
Motherfuckers.

58:06.961 --> 58:08.180
Get up.

58:16.231 --> 58:17.537
Let him up.

58:20.279 --> 58:21.193
Easy, bro.

58:22.368 --> 58:23.500
Hey.

58:23.587 --> 58:25.153
I'll snitch.

58:25.240 --> 58:26.154
I will tell this prick
what you got in there.

58:26.241 --> 58:27.416
Hey.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.548
Cops could be here in no time.

58:32.247 --> 58:33.510
Hey, I got it under control.

58:33.597 --> 58:35.773
-Hey, hi. How you doing?
-Off the bus.

58:35.860 --> 58:37.165
Oh, now. Wait, wait, wait,
wait a second.

58:37.252 --> 58:38.645
You too.

58:38.732 --> 58:40.386
Oh, come on, man.
He attacked me.

58:40.473 --> 58:41.996
I don't want to hear it.
Both of you, off the bus.

58:42.083 --> 58:43.563
Okay, yeah,
we'll-- we'll get off. Come on.

58:43.650 --> 58:45.173
We'll-- we'll both get off.

58:45.260 --> 58:46.827
Hey, timeout. Look.
This is what happened.

58:46.914 --> 58:48.612
This guy,
he started all this shit.

58:48.699 --> 58:50.135
And this guy,
he was defending her.

58:50.222 --> 58:52.093
-Wasn't he?
-Yes.

58:52.180 --> 58:54.661
He was defending me because
that creep tried to touch me.

58:54.748 --> 58:56.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, son.
I never touched this girl.

58:56.663 --> 58:58.012
Well, I saw him do it.

58:58.099 --> 58:59.884
-He attacked her.
-No, no, fuck this shit.

58:59.971 --> 59:01.146
They-they're trying
to set me up.

59:01.233 --> 59:02.669
Hey, I know what I saw.

59:02.756 --> 59:03.801
He tried to grab her
and that's a fact.

59:03.888 --> 59:04.976
Oh, no. This is some bullshit.

59:05.063 --> 59:06.238
He tried to grab me too.

59:06.325 --> 59:07.282
Lying bitch.

59:07.369 --> 59:09.850
Sir, shut the fuck up.

59:09.937 --> 59:12.505
Ma'am, do you want me
to call the cops or not?

59:12.592 --> 59:15.464
No. Throw him off.

59:15.552 --> 59:18.598
Don't throw that guy off
for trying to protect me.

59:18.685 --> 59:20.469
Let's go.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.949
No. Wait a second.

59:22.036 --> 59:23.385
-Wait a second.
-Sir, you'll notice

59:23.472 --> 59:26.040
I have already
pulled the bus over.

59:26.127 --> 59:28.173
My next move
is to call the cops.

59:28.260 --> 59:31.263
Where we are, I figure
that'd take about five minutes.

59:31.350 --> 59:32.569
They're friends of mine.

59:34.701 --> 59:36.094
Okay.

59:37.312 --> 59:41.621
Okay, brother. You're the boss.

59:41.708 --> 59:44.058
I'm-- I'm stepping right off.

59:46.495 --> 59:47.932
You need my blood, right?

59:48.019 --> 59:50.108
I don't want
your blood inside of me.

59:50.195 --> 59:54.286
Go fuck yourself.

59:54.373 --> 59:55.896
Get your fucking hands off me.

59:55.983 --> 59:57.724
You think you're the first crazy
to ride this bus

59:57.811 --> 1:00:00.118
that thinks he can push me
around and get away with it?

1:00:00.205 --> 1:00:02.642
I deal with degenerates like you
every fucking day.

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:04.122
Come on.

1:00:14.219 --> 1:00:15.786
Ain't you fuckin' Roger.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:40.158
Hey. I got thrown off.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:41.376
Come pick me up.

1:00:50.298 --> 1:00:52.779
Pretty wild there
for a second, huh?

1:00:56.435 --> 1:00:57.915
Let me get my piece back.

1:00:58.002 --> 1:00:59.873
Huh?

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.485
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1:01:03.572 --> 1:01:05.662
Take it, man. I don't want it.

1:01:07.446 --> 1:01:10.797
I'm gonna go see
if I shit myself.

1:01:10.884 --> 1:01:12.712
Next stop, Cairo.

1:01:12.799 --> 1:01:15.280
That's Cairo. Last chance.

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:21.112
Lopez family.

1:01:21.199 --> 1:01:22.940
Please report to
the nurses' station.

1:01:23.027 --> 1:01:23.941
Lopez family. Please report
to the nurses' station.

1:01:25.333 --> 1:01:26.987
I fucked up.

1:01:27.074 --> 1:01:28.641
I'm in trouble.
I lost the blood.

1:01:28.728 --> 1:01:29.773
I think I found some.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.035
What?

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:33.341
Is it gonna be enough?

1:01:33.428 --> 1:01:35.996
Enough to lose my job over.

1:01:36.083 --> 1:01:37.737
Look, I'll meet you in the car
in the parking lot

1:01:37.824 --> 1:01:39.434
like I said before, okay?

1:01:39.521 --> 1:01:40.958
How long 'til you get here?

1:01:41.045 --> 1:01:42.263
I'm gonna figure that out.

1:01:42.350 --> 1:01:43.308
Thank you.

1:01:43.395 --> 1:01:44.962
Don't thank me yet.

1:02:37.144 --> 1:02:38.798
Hey, Mom. Mom?

1:02:38.885 --> 1:02:40.365
Lily? What are you doing here?

1:02:40.452 --> 1:02:41.714
The movie's over.

1:02:41.801 --> 1:02:42.846
Can I get a ride home?

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.502
Yeah. Come on.

1:02:57.208 --> 1:02:58.905
Are you going to be okay?

1:03:04.868 --> 1:03:05.956
Yeah.

1:03:09.263 --> 1:03:11.396
Thanks...

1:03:11.483 --> 1:03:12.963
for what you did.

1:03:15.966 --> 1:03:17.924
Hey...

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:19.796
what's your name?

1:03:19.883 --> 1:03:21.014
Rachel.

1:03:22.494 --> 1:03:24.365
Rachel.

1:03:26.150 --> 1:03:27.499
I'm Freddy.

1:03:44.603 --> 1:03:47.171
How old are you really?

1:03:52.263 --> 1:03:53.742
I'm 15.

1:04:02.490 --> 1:04:04.275
I'm 14.

1:04:17.592 --> 1:04:20.334
You really need a hospital, man.

1:04:24.251 --> 1:04:28.255
Rachel, this is Will.

1:04:30.170 --> 1:04:31.650
Hi.

1:04:31.737 --> 1:04:33.086
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:04:37.482 --> 1:04:39.049
I gotta go check this out.

1:04:44.228 --> 1:04:45.359
Come on.

1:04:49.711 --> 1:04:50.756
You want some help, man?

1:04:50.843 --> 1:04:52.192
No.

1:04:53.454 --> 1:04:54.673
Fuck.

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:05.075
Hey, you okay?

1:05:05.162 --> 1:05:07.338
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:05:09.470 --> 1:05:10.558
Sit down there.

1:05:17.957 --> 1:05:19.219
You like puzzles?

1:05:23.963 --> 1:05:25.269
Looks hard.

1:05:25.356 --> 1:05:26.661
Yeah.

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:30.274
Six.

1:05:45.071 --> 1:05:46.768
Where are you, Freddy?

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:48.509
I need you to just listen.

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:51.208
What?

1:05:54.472 --> 1:05:56.735
I'm-- I fucked up bad.

1:05:59.085 --> 1:06:01.044
That doesn't
change anything, Freddy.

1:06:01.131 --> 1:06:02.871
I know.

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:05.309
I know. But I can change.

1:06:05.396 --> 1:06:06.484
No.

1:06:07.528 --> 1:06:09.095
You chose Vic.

1:06:10.749 --> 1:06:14.318
Over me. Over Lily.

1:06:14.405 --> 1:06:15.754
You never did anything for us.

1:06:15.841 --> 1:06:17.364
You did everything for Vic.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:23.196
You broke me, Freddy.

1:06:27.722 --> 1:06:29.724
Why are you doing this?

1:06:29.811 --> 1:06:31.857
I'm doing this for Lily.

1:06:31.944 --> 1:06:33.772
Lily doesn't need
your money, Freddy.

1:06:33.859 --> 1:06:36.644
Lily needed a father.

1:06:36.731 --> 1:06:39.299
I want her to do something good
with her life.

1:06:44.043 --> 1:06:46.045
Take the money.

1:06:50.745 --> 1:06:53.226
Just get here.

1:06:53.313 --> 1:06:54.967
Thank you.

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:12.506
Mm, nine.

1:07:12.593 --> 1:07:14.943
Maybe eight.

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:17.511
- Maybe a three.
- Wrong number.

1:07:17.598 --> 1:07:18.686
Hmm.

1:07:34.224 --> 1:07:35.964
That's one.

1:07:44.234 --> 1:07:45.278
Yeah. You're funny.

1:07:45.365 --> 1:07:46.366
Nine.

1:07:46.453 --> 1:07:47.802
You're funny.

1:08:01.773 --> 1:08:03.253
You're funny.

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:12.827
Four.

1:08:16.004 --> 1:08:18.094
Six.

1:08:19.746 --> 1:08:21.053
Seven.

1:08:28.930 --> 1:08:30.323
Try him again.

1:08:46.209 --> 1:08:47.862
Uh-huh.

1:08:47.949 --> 1:08:51.214
Motherfucker
works in social services,

1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:54.304
finds a girl online.
arranges a meet.

1:08:54.390 --> 1:08:57.045
Then why's he tailing her?

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:58.524
Make sure she gets on the bus?

1:08:58.612 --> 1:09:00.440
Keep a close eye?
The fuck do I know?

1:09:07.447 --> 1:09:09.449
But she's already on the bus.

1:09:09.536 --> 1:09:11.059
Why does he have to do that?

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:13.888
He's preying on her.

1:09:13.975 --> 1:09:16.413
He gets off on it,
that's what these creeps do.

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:19.851
See, Smokie doesn't show up
at the bus station
like they arranged.

1:09:19.938 --> 1:09:23.681
Now she's alone.
But this dude, Will? This "kind"
gentleman she met on the bus?

1:09:23.768 --> 1:09:25.203
He can help her.

1:09:25.291 --> 1:09:27.684
He swoops in.
He can play the hero.

1:09:27.772 --> 1:09:30.383
Says it's getting late,
offers her a place to stay.

1:09:30.469 --> 1:09:31.602
I got it.

1:09:56.235 --> 1:09:57.193
Oh, how about this?

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:00.413
This is fun.

1:10:16.951 --> 1:10:18.866
Hey, Smokie.

1:10:21.347 --> 1:10:24.568
I know what you're doing,
you fuck.

1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:31.401
Sorry, wrong number.

1:10:39.974 --> 1:10:41.106
-You okay?
-Mm-hm.

1:10:41.193 --> 1:10:42.412
I'm gonna go check on him.

1:10:42.499 --> 1:10:43.543
Oh, okay.

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:08.525
Yeah.

1:11:08.612 --> 1:11:10.309
You don't look so hot.

1:11:12.964 --> 1:11:15.271
Leave her alone.

1:11:15.358 --> 1:11:16.968
What you gonna do?

1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:21.451
Call the cops?
Considering your situation,

1:11:21.538 --> 1:11:23.279
that wouldn't be very smart
of you now,

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:24.758
would it?

1:11:28.719 --> 1:11:31.635
So, what do you want to do, huh?

1:11:31.722 --> 1:11:34.550
You want money? How much?

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:39.164
You assume you know what I want.

1:11:41.253 --> 1:11:42.950
Five thousand.

1:11:43.037 --> 1:11:45.083
You ain't getting it, friend.

1:11:45.170 --> 1:11:46.737
Now, look.

1:11:48.782 --> 1:11:50.958
I appreciate you
putting in a good word

1:11:51.045 --> 1:11:55.920
for me with Rachel,
but I'm not for sale.

1:11:56.007 --> 1:11:59.227
Ten thousand dollars.

1:11:59.315 --> 1:12:01.360
You can buy whoever
you want with that.

1:12:01.447 --> 1:12:02.969
Just stay away from her.

1:12:03.057 --> 1:12:04.362
You don't got it.

1:12:04.450 --> 1:12:05.755
I do.

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:15.460
I tell you what.

1:12:18.116 --> 1:12:20.248
How about...

1:12:20.335 --> 1:12:23.556
Hm... she comes with me
anyway...

1:12:25.384 --> 1:12:27.212
and when you die
from all that blood

1:12:27.299 --> 1:12:29.127
that you seem to be losing,

1:12:29.214 --> 1:12:31.041
I'll come back
for the money as well?

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:33.174
Hm?

1:12:34.785 --> 1:12:35.960
Twofer.

1:12:37.875 --> 1:12:40.007
If you will.

1:12:40.094 --> 1:12:41.269
Hm?

1:13:19.743 --> 1:13:23.268
You and me, it's over.

1:13:23.355 --> 1:13:24.922
You need to come back.

1:13:25.009 --> 1:13:27.359
You made a big mistake.

1:13:27.446 --> 1:13:29.317
Do not fuck with me.

1:13:55.996 --> 1:13:57.650
Freddy?

1:13:57.737 --> 1:13:59.957
Chrissy,
I'm not going to make it.

1:14:00.044 --> 1:14:01.393
What?

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:07.530
I got the blood, the drip.

1:14:07.617 --> 1:14:09.009
No.

1:14:09.096 --> 1:14:11.055
No.

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.230
Look, if you can't get to me,

1:14:12.317 --> 1:14:13.971
let me drive to you.

1:14:14.058 --> 1:14:15.625
Where'd you say
you were going again? Cairo?

1:14:15.712 --> 1:14:17.583
I said I'm not coming.

1:14:17.670 --> 1:14:18.758
I don't need your help anymore.

1:14:18.844 --> 1:14:19.759
I don't need you and I don't--

1:14:19.846 --> 1:14:22.066
I got Lily with me.

1:14:22.153 --> 1:14:23.894
No, Chrissy, please.

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:25.068
Here, talk to her.

1:14:32.642 --> 1:14:33.991
Talk to him just once.

1:14:34.077 --> 1:14:35.166
You don't gotta be nice.

1:14:35.253 --> 1:14:36.733
Just let him hear your voice.

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:38.038
Hello?

1:14:43.696 --> 1:14:45.263
Hi, baby.

1:14:45.350 --> 1:14:47.439
You doing all right?

1:14:47.526 --> 1:14:49.876
Yeah. You?

1:14:56.143 --> 1:14:57.536
I'm trying.

1:14:59.103 --> 1:15:00.583
I'm trying real hard.

1:15:06.153 --> 1:15:07.764
I miss you.

1:15:07.851 --> 1:15:10.027
I'm sorry
that I haven't been around.

1:15:13.987 --> 1:15:15.380
Freddy?

1:15:22.343 --> 1:15:24.955
I'm taking the money
and I'm leaving.

1:15:25.041 --> 1:15:26.609
I don't need your help anymore.

1:15:30.568 --> 1:15:33.441
You were Plan B.

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:35.922
You were always just Plan B.

1:15:37.576 --> 1:15:39.665
So stay the fuck away.

1:15:43.277 --> 1:15:45.410
You were right, Chrissy.

1:15:46.846 --> 1:15:51.285
I chose Vic. I always chose Vic.

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.528
I love you, Mama.

1:16:18.965 --> 1:16:20.445
I love you too, baby.

1:17:28.382 --> 1:17:30.036
There's your Smokie.

1:17:33.648 --> 1:17:35.607
What?

1:17:35.693 --> 1:17:38.001
Will.

1:17:38.088 --> 1:17:40.612
Will is Smokie.

1:17:40.699 --> 1:17:42.788
He's playing you.

1:17:42.875 --> 1:17:44.529
Nah. I think you've...

1:17:44.616 --> 1:17:48.098
I think you've lost
a little bit too much blood.

1:17:48.184 --> 1:17:50.013
Cairo in five minutes.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:52.014
Five minutes to Cairo.

1:17:57.455 --> 1:17:59.978
All right.
All right, I got an idea.

1:18:00.066 --> 1:18:01.851
That's my boy!

1:18:03.068 --> 1:18:05.289
An idea for what?

1:18:05.376 --> 1:18:06.769
You gotta trust me.

1:18:09.293 --> 1:18:11.861
Empty your backpack.

1:18:32.098 --> 1:18:34.579
Fill your bag up with this.

1:18:37.147 --> 1:18:38.714
Then put your stuff in mine.

1:18:41.064 --> 1:18:42.587
Why am I doing this?

1:18:42.674 --> 1:18:45.633
I need you
to get it to someone.

1:18:45.721 --> 1:18:49.420
Her name is Christine.
Take my phone.

1:18:49.507 --> 1:18:52.249
Call her
and get the money to her.

1:18:52.335 --> 1:18:54.294
Can you do that?

1:18:54.380 --> 1:18:56.601
How do you know
I'm not gonna steal it?

1:18:59.909 --> 1:19:01.606
Because I'm trusting you.

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:08.700
I told you before,
someone took advantage of me.

1:19:11.094 --> 1:19:14.139
Look, what I lost,
I can't get back.

1:19:17.796 --> 1:19:20.538
You gotta still believe
you're worth something.

1:19:20.625 --> 1:19:23.410
Even when nobody else does,
you gotta believe.

1:19:28.589 --> 1:19:30.940
You got your whole life
ahead of you, Rachel.

1:19:32.898 --> 1:19:34.334
You make the right choice.

1:19:47.173 --> 1:19:49.088
What do you
want me to tell her?

1:19:50.481 --> 1:19:51.830
Tell her...

1:19:54.050 --> 1:19:57.227
tell her, when we were
at that state park...

1:19:58.663 --> 1:20:00.186
on the water...

1:20:02.232 --> 1:20:04.930
I knew right then
that I loved her.

1:20:07.628 --> 1:20:08.760
But I didn't say it.

1:20:12.808 --> 1:20:14.853
But I could never be a father.

1:20:19.423 --> 1:20:22.556
So tell her I wish I'd said it.

1:20:24.428 --> 1:20:26.125
Can you do that for me?

1:20:28.562 --> 1:20:29.650
Yeah.

1:20:39.443 --> 1:20:43.316
Tell her that I'm sorry.

1:20:43.403 --> 1:20:45.971
I'm so fucking sorry.

1:20:48.669 --> 1:20:51.585
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:20:51.672 --> 1:20:52.848
Look at me.

1:20:55.023 --> 1:20:58.809
You're going to be okay.

1:20:58.897 --> 1:21:01.204
You're gonna be fine.

1:21:01.291 --> 1:21:03.075
You're gonna be fine.
We're almost there.

1:21:03.162 --> 1:21:05.861
You're gonna tell her.
You're gonna be okay.

1:21:06.862 --> 1:21:08.689
Okay?

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:14.957
Just give me my bag.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:22.921
Put it here.

1:21:29.841 --> 1:21:31.625
- Take this.
- Okay.

1:21:31.712 --> 1:21:32.888
Go sit up front.

1:21:37.762 --> 1:21:39.807
Hey.

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.157
Okay.

1:21:41.244 --> 1:21:43.115
You're gonna be okay.

1:21:45.204 --> 1:21:46.291
Hey.

1:21:49.252 --> 1:21:50.296
You got this.

1:21:58.739 --> 1:21:59.827
I got this.

1:22:05.659 --> 1:22:06.965
Everything okay?

1:22:07.052 --> 1:22:08.053
Yes.

1:22:27.246 --> 1:22:29.248
Everything happens for a reason.

1:23:06.503 --> 1:23:07.678
You got this.

1:23:41.973 --> 1:23:43.975
Last stop, Cairo.

1:24:19.184 --> 1:24:20.403
Rachel.

1:24:21.882 --> 1:24:22.927
Thanks.

1:24:26.583 --> 1:24:28.411
I've gotta get you out of here.

1:24:30.630 --> 1:24:33.242
He's a very bad person
and I've gotta protect you.

1:24:36.984 --> 1:24:38.464
You can trust me.

1:24:40.901 --> 1:24:42.380
Good girl. Let's go.

1:24:48.952 --> 1:24:51.085
Go ahead.

1:24:52.434 --> 1:24:53.914
You too. Get out of here.

1:25:05.448 --> 1:25:06.753
You with him?

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:07.972
Yes.

1:25:08.059 --> 1:25:09.495
Run along, sweetheart.

1:25:11.193 --> 1:25:12.281
Ah!

1:25:13.325 --> 1:25:15.153
Not you.

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:16.850
Rach.

1:25:16.937 --> 1:25:19.114
Don't worry about her.
Just open the bag.

1:25:20.898 --> 1:25:22.552
Rach.

1:25:22.639 --> 1:25:23.987
Where you going?

1:25:24.075 --> 1:25:27.339
I said open the fucking bag.

1:25:28.775 --> 1:25:29.907
Why?

1:25:39.351 --> 1:25:40.787
Make sure it's all there.

1:26:23.656 --> 1:26:24.657
Oh!

1:26:31.403 --> 1:26:32.925
Oh, yeah.

1:26:33.013 --> 1:26:35.102
Yes,
listen we got the shipment back.

1:26:40.456 --> 1:26:43.154
I'm not going with you.

1:26:49.726 --> 1:26:52.119
I'm not going with you, Vic.

1:26:56.646 --> 1:26:58.213
Oh, baby.

1:27:33.726 --> 1:27:34.945
We good?

1:27:40.733 --> 1:27:42.648
Get him the fuck out of here.

1:27:50.612 --> 1:27:51.875
No.

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:54.356
No.

1:28:25.169 --> 1:28:27.780
What the fuck?
It's some fucking bullshit.

1:28:27.867 --> 1:28:29.391
This is fucking bullshit.

1:28:32.655 --> 1:28:33.960
Huh?

1:28:40.053 --> 1:28:41.272
What the fuck.

1:28:43.753 --> 1:28:45.494
What the fuck is this?

1:28:45.581 --> 1:28:48.496
Motherfucker...
he's missing 100 grand.

1:28:48.584 --> 1:28:50.847
