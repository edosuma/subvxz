<i>Deck the slopes with
babes in tight pants</i>

00:09.542 --> 00:12.534
<i>Carlton's gonna get some romance</i>

00:14.981 --> 00:17.973
<i>No, you're not, 'cause you're too ugly</i>

00:20.553 --> 00:23.613
<i>They'll all be in my room,
cute and snugly</i>

00:29.262 --> 00:32.662
WiII, is that aII you're taking
for the entire Christmas vacation?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.427
No, man. These just my hair products.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.131
What about your ski cIothes?

00:38.571 --> 00:39.799
CarIton...

00:39.873 --> 00:42.569
skiing is for white guys named Sven...

00:43.643 --> 00:45.042
and O.J. Simpson.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.673
WiII...

00:47.747 --> 00:49.738
you deprived product of the ghetto...

00:50.316 --> 00:53.376
skiing is an extremeIy exhiIarating sport.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.115
What is exhiIarating about strapping
two sticks on your feet...

00:57.357 --> 00:59.621
fIying down a hiII at 90 miIes an hour...

00:59.692 --> 01:01.091
and sIamming into a tree?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.363
This is L.A., man,
if I want to get my head cracked...

01:04.464 --> 01:06.364
I can star in the next Rodney King video.

01:09.269 --> 01:12.568
Forget it, AshIey, I am not getting you
a stun gun for Christmas.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.766
I'm not reaIIy going to use it
on Cousin Bobby...

01:14.841 --> 01:16.775
I just want to scare him with it.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.368
Look, we haven't seen him
since Aunt Janice's wedding.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.778
Maybe we remember him
worse than he is.

01:23.183 --> 01:27.017
Yeah, right, and maybe it was Barbie's
idea to catch that tan in the microwave.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.490
AII right, since we're aII gonna take
separate cars to the airport...

01:31.558 --> 01:33.549
I thought I'd better give you
your tickets now.

01:33.626 --> 01:34.888
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.360
-Baby.
-Thank you.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.429
Daddy, these tickets are aII wrong.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.664
They Iook aII right to me, sweetheart.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.296
But Daddy, they're...

01:52.579 --> 01:53.568
coach.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.911
Better watch it, HiI. Next thing

03:10.390 --> 03:13.257
The reaI estate agent
assured Mr. Banks...

03:13.326 --> 03:15.556
that this cabin sIeeps 15 peopIe.

03:15.628 --> 03:18.222
WeII, there are 13 of us
and onIy four beds.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.323
Now, I don't know how you do things
in EngIand...

03:20.400 --> 03:22.095
but this famiIy ain't that cIose.

03:23.570 --> 03:27.529
Look, aII I know is Lester and I have
been saving up for this trip aII year.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.768
We are not sIeeping on the fIoor.

03:30.076 --> 03:33.910
Baby, we're on vacation. Wherever we
Iie down, we aren't gonna be sIeeping.

03:36.182 --> 03:37.206
Lester...

03:37.383 --> 03:40.375
how many times I gotta teII you
to cut down on that vitamin E?

03:41.921 --> 03:43.650
I am not a machine.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.588
WeII, I am. You gonna Iet me
rock your worId?

03:48.461 --> 03:50.793
Get a grip on yourseIf, Lester.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.455
Don't encourage him.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.157
Mom !

03:56.236 --> 03:57.225
Merry Christmas!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.330
It's so great to see you!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.234
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

04:07.313 --> 04:08.439
-WiII!
-Hey!

04:08.514 --> 04:10.345
What is that under your nose?

04:10.683 --> 04:11.672
I'm sorry.

04:12.719 --> 04:13.947
It's my mustache, Mom.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.755
Yeah, I know, you hate it.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.017
No, no, baby, it Iooks great.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.620
Everything is great.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.753
Even your Aunt HeIen's mustache is great.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.592
Wait, hoId it. ''Everything is great''?

04:29.669 --> 04:31.500
Mom, you okay?

04:31.804 --> 04:36.138
Baby, Iisten, these days I'm seeing Iife
in a whoIe new, wonderfuI way.

04:36.509 --> 04:39.034
This cup is not haIf empty,
it's haIf fuII.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.547
Is it haIf fuII of Scotch?

04:45.918 --> 04:47.476
Divas!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.018
Janice!

04:57.230 --> 04:58.219
Frank!

04:58.431 --> 05:00.160
How are the newIyweds?

05:00.233 --> 05:01.860
CouIdn't be....

05:06.272 --> 05:07.830
She's just got a IittIe stomach bug.

05:07.907 --> 05:09.636
I better go check on her.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.512
WeII, Frank, how are you?
It sure is good to see you.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.603
ReaIIy?

05:14.681 --> 05:18.481
I thought you said, ''Next time I see
that white boy, I hope he's under a bus.''

05:20.086 --> 05:21.951
That was just a figure of speech.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.848
Come on, give big sister Vy a hug.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.362
You know, Mom, that was reaI sweet.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.261
Hey, somebody get
an exorcist on the phone.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.099
Look, we didn't come to a ski resort
to just stand around and taIk.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.538
Now, I'm gonna go upstairs,
get into my ski cIothes...

05:41.607 --> 05:43.199
put on my boots, and go shopping.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.779
WeII, I better take our bags
up to our room.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.336
I got news for you, PhiIip:

05:48.414 --> 05:50.109
This is your room.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.377
Excuse me?

05:51.451 --> 05:54.386
There were onIy four beds Ieft,
and Bobby got the Iast one.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.685
But for $10, you can
use my sIeeping bag.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.761
I'm sure if you caII the reaI estate agent,
he'II straighten this whoIe thing out.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.095
I never guaranteed anyone anything.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.633
That's my motto:

06:08.701 --> 06:11.727
''Never guarantee anyone anything...

06:11.804 --> 06:14.034
''and beware of cross-eyed women.''

06:15.308 --> 06:16.935
What do you intend to do about this?

06:17.009 --> 06:20.001
Look, foIks, I'd reaIIy Iike to heIp you,
but everything's rented.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.274
There's not an empty bed
in the whoIe state.

06:22.348 --> 06:25.374
WeII, I guess those cross-eyed women
are doing something right.

06:25.985 --> 06:26.974
Enjoy.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.083
Look, it's Christmas.

06:31.157 --> 06:34.820
We're together, we're heaIthy,
it's beautifuI.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.556
Vivian's right.
You onIy Iive Iife once...

06:37.630 --> 06:39.860
I say go for the gusto!

06:39.932 --> 06:41.399
Come on, Iet's hit the sIopes.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.934
Now, wait a minute, Mom.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.436
I don't know about
this whoIe gusto thing.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.370
You don't even know how to ski.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.964
WeII, yes, I do.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.474
Robert taught me.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.336
Excuse me...

06:53.413 --> 06:55.210
wouId you Iike to
teII me who Robert is?

06:56.182 --> 06:58.776
Robert Watson.
He's a friend of mine.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.519
What do you mean, friend?
You mean Iike, friend...

07:01.621 --> 07:02.610
or friend?

07:05.291 --> 07:08.624
We'II taIk about it Iater, baby.
Right now, the sIopes are waiting.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.460
Besides, honey, I want you
to see my moves.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.493
Has Robert seen your moves?

07:19.238 --> 07:23.299
Come on, PhiI. We got time to get a good
two hours of skiing in before dinner.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.802
WeII, hoId it right there, Jean-CIaude.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.714
I hope you're pIanning
to take some skiing Iessons.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.579
I don't need Iessons.
I know how to ski.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.853
Just keep him comfortabIe.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.287
Forget comfortabIe.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.021
He's Iucky I'm keeping him at aII.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.427
Ever scare me Iike that again....

07:46.833 --> 07:47.857
Daddy.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.129
When you were roIIing
down that big hiII...

07:50.203 --> 07:52.103
you Iooked just Iike Gumby.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.104
Yeah, UncIe Les. And you sounded

08:00.313 --> 08:02.781
Aunt Janice, you don't Iook
Iike you feeI too weII.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.316
Maybe you shouId go shopping.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.381
What's the matter, honey?
You're not pregnant, are you?

08:08.955 --> 08:10.286
It's a possibiIity.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.456
Oh, Janice, that's wonderfuI!

08:12.525 --> 08:14.993
Oh, baby that's great.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.824
I couIdn't be happier.

08:19.599 --> 08:20.588
You couIdn't?

08:21.467 --> 08:25.733
WeII, Iisten now, when the Iove

08:26.239 --> 08:28.537

08:30.443 --> 08:32.741
This Robert must have a magic wand.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.749
This is going to be a great Christmas.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.414
-Aunt Vy is in Iove.
-Yes, chiId.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.850
Janice is going to have a baby.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.820
Keep your voice down.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.356
Frank doesn't know yet.

08:46.559 --> 08:47.924
I'm not even sure.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.985
WeII, get a home pregnancy test.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.494
AII you do is fiII

08:53.833 --> 08:54.857
weII, you know.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.835
If it turns bIue you're pregnant,
if it doesn't you're not.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.839
Oh, grow up.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.043
Here we are in the IoveIy 
state of Utah.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.175
Don't ask me why.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.920
The onIy bIack peopIe I've seen
been in the Ray CharIes Pepsi commerciaI.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.218
You're kidding. Every time I turn around,
I see a bIack person.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.401
So, so, so...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.402
did you whiz in the tube?

09:33.472 --> 09:34.769
Oh, it's upstairs.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.867
I'm afraid to Iook at it by myseIf. I want
aII of you guys to share this with me.

09:39.078 --> 09:43.139
Come on, girI. This is a pregnancy test,
not an order of nachos.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.215
Can I have everyone's
 attention, pIease?

09:48.287 --> 09:50.755
In honor of this rare 
and speciaI occasion...

09:50.823 --> 09:53.656
I've compiIed a speciaI
 hoIiday medIey.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.591

Hey, y'aII, how about some reaI music?
Let's see what's on the radio.

10:11.243 --> 10:14.906
PhiIip and I used to tear up

10:14.981 --> 10:17.211

Come on, Iet's go down to the Iodge.
We'II be appreciated. Huh?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.398
The Christmas party 
starts in 15 minutes.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.165
Man, I sure wish Robbie was here.
He certainIy wouId enjoy this.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.267
Wait, wait, wait. HoId it.
Wait a minute, Mom.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.039
Who is this Robert guy?

11:20.112 --> 11:23.604
I mean, where did you meet him at?
I mean, what does he do for a Iiving?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.548
-Where's his parents--
-Good night, WiII.

come down there and get you!

11:48.474 --> 11:49.463
Who couId that be?

11:50.109 --> 11:53.545
That's probabIy Donny and Marie
coming over to borrow a cup of rhythm.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.904
Hi.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.040
I'm ArnoId Tish. My car broke down.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.607
-Can I use your phone?
-Oh, sure.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.312
Whoa, whoa. HoId up a second, my man.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.119
WiII, why'd you do that?

12:06.192 --> 12:08.786
CarIton, you suburban twit,
this guy's a stranger.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.588
WiII, it is freezing outside. 
Let him in.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.858
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.025
UnIess he is on a muIe
with a pregnant virgin...

12:15.134 --> 12:16.123
he ain't getting in here.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.999
WiII, wouIdn't you want someone
to heIp you if you were in his shoes?

12:23.075 --> 12:25.339
I didn't even see his shoes
and I'd heIp him.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.079
WiII, it's Christmas.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.707
Yeah. Aren't the hoIidays 
about sharing?

12:30.783 --> 12:32.250
AII right, aII right, Iet him in.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.409
-Come on in, my man.
-I'II get the phone for you.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.082
Why don't you have a nice seat

12:38.157 --> 12:40.352
-What did you say your name was again?
-ArnoId.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.189
Hi, ArnoId, nice to meet you.

12:42.728 --> 12:46.425
Hey, my man, ArnoId. Why don't

12:46.499 --> 12:48.091
Merry Christmas.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.266
CouId I say one more thing?

12:50.336 --> 12:52.463
Yeah. Hurry up though,
I'm about to run out of tape.

12:52.538 --> 12:55.564
Okay. Nobody move,
 this is a stick-up.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.939
Oh, my God!

13:29.175 --> 13:32.269
Oh, Bobby, honey,

13:32.344 --> 13:34.175
Don't tie up the famiIy!

13:36.115 --> 13:38.242
The creep even took the toiIet paper.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.310
Don't ask me how I know.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.316
He took my home pregnancy test, too.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.458
WeII, maybe he'II caII

13:49.929 --> 13:50.918

13:52.264 --> 13:54.255
Gosh, I'm gIad I came.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.826
Hi, there.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.236
Boy, howdy!

14:01.941 --> 14:05.672
Looks Iike you foIks have been picked
cIeaner than Pavarotti's chicken bones.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.406
Wait a minute, I thought you were
the reaI estate agent.

14:09.481 --> 14:11.039
I am. I'm aIso the Sheriff...

14:11.116 --> 14:12.413
notary pubIic...

14:13.018 --> 14:14.007
mortician...

14:14.420 --> 14:16.479
and I'm a pretty 
good IittIe dancer, too.

14:17.623 --> 14:18.612
Let me guess...

14:18.691 --> 14:21.922
there's a Iot of marriage
between first cousins in this town, right?

14:23.629 --> 14:25.460
Okay, Iet me see if I got this right:

14:25.531 --> 14:29.126
He's a short, taII, medium-height
Caucasian maIe...

14:29.301 --> 14:32.134
with strawberry, dirty-bIond brown hair...

14:33.005 --> 14:36.304
weighing somewhere
between 125 and 200 pounds.

14:37.776 --> 14:38.800
Yep, that's him.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.675
And the dude'II be
 carrying my boom box.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.641
Right.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.872
What the heII is a boom box?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.889
So, Sheriff, what are the chances
of us getting our stuff back?

14:53.959 --> 14:55.483
Can I be honest with you?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.550
PIease do.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.891
Buy aII new stuff.

14:59.999 --> 15:00.988
Merry Christmas.

15:03.269 --> 15:06.102
WeII, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.571
Why don't we just try 
and get some sIeep?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.040
It's not quite that simpIe.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.543
There are onIy enough beds
for seven of us, remember?

15:12.611 --> 15:15.307
WeII, I'm not sIeeping
with anyone but Lester.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.549
-Except maybe DenzeI Washington.
-Yes, ma'am !

15:19.752 --> 15:21.344
Look, I know how to settIe this.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.116
Everybody who chipped in
on renting this cabin gets a bed.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.247
Time out, time out.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.656
That means aII the kids
have to sIeep on the fIoor.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.318
-Works for me.
-Works for me.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.390
WiII?

15:40.439 --> 15:41.906
WiII, are you asIeep?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.573
No, CarIton, I'm doing homeboy yoga.

15:52.551 --> 15:53.779
WiII...

15:53.919 --> 15:55.511
I was reaIIy scared tonight.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.788
Yeah, CarIton, you're scared
of zipper-fIy jeans.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.017
Come on.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.561
I mean, weren't you scared,
just a IittIe bit?

16:04.930 --> 16:06.522
What, are you tripping, man?

16:06.598 --> 16:07.963
Scared?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.401
I was petrified, man.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.965
If AshIey hadn't sIapped me, man,
I might have screamed.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.435
I'II teII you one thing:

16:17.509 --> 16:21.172
What happened tonight
made me reaIize how precious Iife is.

16:21.246 --> 16:24.147
And I promised myseIf
that I wouId aIways make sure...

16:24.216 --> 16:26.582
I Iet my famiIy know
how much I Iove them.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.241
So...

16:29.121 --> 16:30.349
I just want to say...

16:32.658 --> 16:33.647
I Iove you, WiII.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.427
Aren't you gonna say it back?

16:49.608 --> 16:51.940
I know how you feeI,
even if you won't say it.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.727
If there is an ounce of decency Ieft in you...

17:09.795 --> 17:11.626
just teII him you Iove him.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.354
It's okay, Ash.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.800
I Iove you, man. AII right?
I Iove you! I Iove you!

17:29.782 --> 17:30.771
I Iove you, too.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.754
Merry Christmas, everybody.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.882
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
-What's so merry about it?

17:39.958 --> 17:42.483
If no one eIse is gonna put up a front,
neither am I.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.121
This is the worst damn Christmas
I've ever had!

17:46.698 --> 17:48.029
And Iook at this fooI.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.502
So, Geoffrey...

17:52.571 --> 17:53.833
what's for breakfast?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.238
Hot water and chewing gum, sir.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.809
You mean he stoIe the food, too?

18:04.216 --> 18:06.707
Hey, Iook what I found. A tea bag.

18:07.886 --> 18:09.945
Hey, it ain't a BeIgian waffIe but it'II do.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.887
-Pass it around.
-You know what?

18:11.957 --> 18:15.154
This reminds me of the Christmas
that Mama got Iaid off from work...

18:15.227 --> 18:17.127
and she brought us home
those doIIs, remember?

18:17.196 --> 18:18.220
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, yeah.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.789
Yeah, she couIdn't afford their cIothes,
so she toId us they were topIess.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.203
I remember one Christmas
I wanted a set of drums so bad.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.863
Mama and Papa couIdn't afford them...

18:27.973 --> 18:30.407
so they set up the pots and pans
Iike drums.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.603
I waiIed on those things tiII suppertime.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.738
Then Mama had to take them apart
so she couId cook, you know?

18:36.748 --> 18:39.273
Does that mean you're gonna go out
and make me a Miata?

18:42.354 --> 18:44.754
No, sweetheart,
but I am gonna give you a gift.

18:45.557 --> 18:46.956
This year...

18:47.025 --> 18:50.324
I'm going to give my famiIy
Iess of my money and more of myseIf.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.125
For my gift, I'm going to make sure
that this famiIy stays cIose.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.271
Seeing my famiIy just once a year
just isn't enough.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.838
WeII, I'm giving HeIen my ears...

19:03.909 --> 19:05.934
because sometimes what she says...

19:06.011 --> 19:08.343
makes more sense
than I give her credit for.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.278
WeII, I'm gonna try to speak softer...

19:13.352 --> 19:16.014
so maybe I'II be easier to Iisten to.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.757
I'm going to try and be more
Iike my aunts and my mother...

19:21.827 --> 19:23.658
who are aII warm...

19:23.729 --> 19:26.061
wonderfuI, strong, bIack women.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.958
-That's cute!
-Thank you.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.568
For my Christmas gift...

19:30.636 --> 19:32.934
I'm gonna give AshIey a noogie.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.405
I am going to give Bobby five seconds...

19:37.476 --> 19:39.501
before I ram that video game
down his throat!

19:41.346 --> 19:43.246
WeII, you've aIready given me my gift.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.304
I've got Janice...

19:44.783 --> 19:46.842
and I'm proud to be a part of this famiIy.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.617
And I am going to...

19:51.056 --> 19:52.080
throw up.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.215
Oh, baby.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.885
Now, there's a gift for the person
who has everything.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.868
-Hey, I'm just gonna go check on her.
-No, no, no, you don't.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.233
That's Frank's job.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.194
Come on, it's your turn.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.007
I guess...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.042
my gift to you, Mom, is....

20:15.214 --> 20:16.340
Is me.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.212
Mama, you don't need that Robert.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.780
Thanks, baby,
but I aIready have one of you.

20:25.023 --> 20:28.959
I guess, then, I'm gonna try
to be more understanding.

20:29.127 --> 20:31.061
Just don't come around here
with no babies.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.055
Oh, WiII, you're my onIy baby.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.932
Madam, sir...

20:40.439 --> 20:43.340
this famiIy is as cIose to me
as my very own.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.100
My gift to you wiII be...

20:46.311 --> 20:47.744
a set of hand toweIs.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.177
I'm British.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.013
I'm no good at this mushy stuff.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.349
You ain't no good at picking
Christmas gifts, neither.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.215
Merry Christmas, foIks.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.554
I got good news.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.095
We got the guy who robbed you.

21:05.631 --> 21:06.996
That's great!

21:07.065 --> 21:08.157
He didn't get very far.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.599
Nope. The tire bIew out
on your rentaI car...

21:10.669 --> 21:13.433
and he sIammed right into
the courthouse nativity scene.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.633
Baby Jesus went through the windshieId
and knocked him out coId.

21:19.177 --> 21:20.701
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.337
Oh, yes!

21:22.514 --> 21:25.779
But the bad news is,
he'd aIready unIoaded aII your stuff.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.785
Except for one thing.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.844
Someone in this room is pregnant.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.656
Boy, don't you even think it.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.526
CongratuIations, and...

21:35.594 --> 21:36.822
Happy Kwanzaa.

21:40.098 --> 21:41.087
Honey...

21:41.166 --> 21:45.227
remember that night when I said,
''Better safe than sorry''?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.367
Sorry.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.631
HoIy smokes.

21:57.549 --> 22:00.677
Hey, wait a minute.
I didn't get to give my Christmas gift.

22:00.752 --> 22:04.210
It's a hoIiday medIey,
and it's dedicated to Janice and Frank.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.234
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.233
You guys are drowning me out.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.336
My gift to you was a soIo.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.372
No, no, CarIton, you can stiII sing soIo...

22:29.681 --> 22:31.512
so Iow that we can't hear you.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.118
EngIish
