Do you know why
they called it the 225?

01:17.035 --> 01:20.615
Because it was exactly
225 inches long,

We play a card game here
l've never seen anywhere else.

14:17.315 --> 14:18.765
lt's called, "l'm Buying."

14:18.900 --> 14:21.280
Everyone looks for
specific card combinations,

14:21.402 --> 14:23.702
and gets rid of as many cards
as possible.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.161
l'm buying!

14:25.281 --> 14:27.201
You don't have to yell!

14:27.325 --> 14:29.075
You either buy or you don't!

14:29.202 --> 14:31.752
So, ClÃ©ment, any news on the garage?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.831
Not yet.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.127
Threes here, eights there.
l have one card left!

14:38.294 --> 14:40.214
You're killing me, Îœom.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.418
Did you hear the news?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.089
Jeanne got married last week.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.888
lsn't she over 60?

14:48.012 --> 14:49.642
lt was a shotgun wedding.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.982
You're the only ones left!

You'd like that, Roland!

15:02.819 --> 15:05.989
l mean, you'd like that,
Îœr. Beaulieu.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.374
lt's just that
we think marriage is...

15:08.491 --> 15:12.701
Would anyone like a beer,
a Perrier, a brandy or something?

15:12.829 --> 15:14.749
No, Îœom, we're good.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.622
Sit down. We're playing!

15:18.042 --> 15:19.172
OK, my turn.

15:20.169 --> 15:24.049
Seven here, king there.
Give me your gal.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.181
Done!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.138
l haven't even played yet!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.853
Jokers and twos are wild.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.023
We affectionately
call them the "gals."

15:34.142 --> 15:37.102
When everyone's ready,
the dealer flips the first card.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.478
lf it's a gal,
you have to discard it.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.152
So, what did the dentist say?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.606
- They'll both need braces.
- Yep, braces.

15:46.738 --> 15:47.778
Oh yeah?

15:47.905 --> 15:50.025
- Count your cards, OK?
- Yes.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.578
Bunny? Why don't you
look in Quebec City?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.873
You know we want to buy in Îœontreal.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.327
You can change your mind.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.464
We take turns picking cards.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.884
You discard after each turn.
The one next to the dealer starts.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.504
Whose turn is it?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.381
When it's lagging, it's Paul.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.803
Today would be nice.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.796
- Come on!
- We're waiting!

16:11.554 --> 16:12.554

16:38.831 --> 16:40.711
Don't mind me.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.741
Hurry up! l'm hungry.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.244
Can we have a bowl, please?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.082
Just a second.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.089
Get the milk and sugar.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.468
l want a banana.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.762
There's only apples.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.904

He's in decent shape.
He looks good, considering!

17:54.365 --> 17:58.905
l accidentally saw
the radiation marks on his stomach.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.826
His treatments aren't over yet.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.285
When prostate cancer
is caught in time,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.456
it's no worse
than appendicitis.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.125
- Nothing to worry about.
- He's going to be fine.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.464
Definitely.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.339
Îœonique! Lucie! Suzanne!
Come on!

18:12.467 --> 18:13.427
- Here we go!

18:13.551 --> 18:15.721
- He's spoiling them.
- lt makes him happy.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.215
Stop right here. Close your eyes.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.848
Don't open them until l say so.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.767
Quebec City, man!

18:32.445 --> 18:34.195
l'm not sure we'll ever
get independence.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.122
Îœe neither! l think
we might have missed the boat.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.291
1 980 was the time to do it,
with RenÃ© LÃ©vesque.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.746
Open them!

18:44.874 --> 18:47.004
Wow, bikes!

18:47.126 --> 18:49.416
- Thanks, Grandpa!
- You're welcome!

18:49.545 --> 18:52.205
- Thanks, Grandma!
- Go on!

18:52.757 --> 18:54.167
l don't believe it!

18:54.300 --> 18:57.260
Canadian flags
on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.176
- Watch out for your flag!
- Thanks, Grandpa!

19:00.306 --> 19:02.306
Be careful! Don't go too far!

19:02.433 --> 19:05.023
Thanks, Grandma!
Thanks, Grandpa!

19:10.107 --> 19:13.277
Dad, Îœathilde could have
taken Rose's next year.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.902
Rose could have Philippe's.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.489
- ÎœylÃ¨ne could have Judith's.
- lt's too much!

19:17.615 --> 19:20.405
You're retired!
You have to watch your budget.

19:20.743 --> 19:24.253
Paul, let's take the dogs
for a walk.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.757
Come on, pedal!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.132
lt's hard on the rocks.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.049
OK, let's stop here.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.507
Use the kickstand.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.347
- Let's let them run.
- Good idea.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.602
- Come on, run!
- Go on!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.269
Let me have one.

19:48.396 --> 19:49.686
Yeah.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.526
You don't smoke Canadians anymore?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.607
l guess it's all the same.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.660
l got a nice one!

20:06.289 --> 20:10.379
Damn! What do they put in these?
lt tastes like crap!

20:12.587 --> 20:14.587
- That's too big.
- Give it to me.

20:14.714 --> 20:19.384
So, it seems like
the radiation is helping.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.219
Yeah, right!
l can't get it up anymore.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.506
No fair! You're further ahead.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.809
Don't go in the water, Îœathilde!

20:31.689 --> 20:33.109
Kids!

20:33.232 --> 20:35.152
Let's take some pictures!

20:36.861 --> 20:39.071
Look, l found a frog!

20:39.196 --> 20:41.106
Rose! Look at me!

20:42.825 --> 20:45.325
ÎœylÃ¨ne, Judith, turn around!

20:49.957 --> 20:52.497
Gross!
lt's all slimy.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.709
Where did you find this?

20:56.839 --> 20:57.839
lsn't that you?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.545
Of course it is.
l'm asking where you found it.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.506
lt was in a box of family photos.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.636
ls that your father?

21:08.559 --> 21:09.769
Yes.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.225
You scratched his face off
pretty good.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.646
lt was the day my mother left.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.361
Left...

21:18.694 --> 21:21.954
As in she left town, or she died?

21:22.073 --> 21:24.413
As in took off.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.913
l'm sorry.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.210
That day,

21:35.711 --> 21:39.761
my mother sent me to the store
to pick up some pictures.

21:43.928 --> 21:48.138
We had gone to the church picnic
for the poor.

21:48.808 --> 21:53.058
The priest had taken pictures
of the whole family.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.264
Don't touch that,
you little brat!

22:25.928 --> 22:27.548
Get out of here!

22:29.557 --> 22:32.677
We lived in squalor
on Tourelle Street.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.731
Îœy father was a drunk and a gambler.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.860
All he did
was get his wife pregnant.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.237
He gave her nine kids.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.256
Goddamn sissy music!

23:28.783 --> 23:31.203
No, let go of me!

23:32.745 --> 23:34.325
Let go!

24:37.393 --> 24:39.943
Let someone else screw you,
you damn slut!

25:20.936 --> 25:22.726
We never saw her again.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.895
She died 1 5 years ago.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.110
Cancer...

25:32.698 --> 25:34.408
of the pancreas.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.332
Just like l have.

25:41.165 --> 25:42.415
Yes.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.677
All right!

25:57.556 --> 26:01.636
Let's go, before your mother-in-law
starts to worry.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.482
What are you waiting for?

26:07.608 --> 26:10.068
- Rose, wait for me!
- Hurry up!

26:10.194 --> 26:13.614
We look like a couple of wimps
with our poodles, huh?

27:36.447 --> 27:37.907
Rose, l have to pee.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.056
You OK, Dad?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.896
- He'll be fine.
- That happens with radiation.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.732
We'll get a drink of water.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.227
l'll bring some hotdogs back out.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.650
No, Îœom! We're gonna burst.

28:16.779 --> 28:19.279
Sing, then! Go on, sing!

28:29.541 --> 28:32.961
Rosaire's raccoon?
Didn't we throw that thing out?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.212
Are you going to tell the story?

28:35.339 --> 28:37.009
Why don't you do it tonight?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.132
But l like it when you do it.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.219
You start. l'll be right back out.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.972
- Grandpa?
- Yes?

28:44.098 --> 28:47.348
- What are the hens like?
- They're nice and plump.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.726
And don't forget the tooshie.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.023
l won't!

28:53.148 --> 28:55.268
Nice and plump...

29:03.367 --> 29:05.657
- Îœathilde?
- What?

29:05.786 --> 29:07.786
Do you like stories?

29:07.913 --> 29:08.963
Yeah!

29:09.665 --> 29:12.075
Come here and l'll tell you one.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.923
This is the story of a nice raccoon

29:18.048 --> 29:20.128
who was very hungry.

29:20.259 --> 29:24.299
He always had to look for food
around people's houses,

29:24.430 --> 29:29.100
because back then,
people had hens in their yards.

29:29.226 --> 29:33.806
And a hen was like a feast
for a raccoon.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.780
But when the raccoon saw the hens,
all nice and plump,

29:39.194 --> 29:40.784
he went completely crazy.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.994
He threw himself on the hens.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.575
He slit one's throat,
decapitated another,

29:45.701 --> 29:48.541
clawed to the right and to the left
like a maniac.

29:48.662 --> 29:53.002
There was blood everywhere,
like, 1 0 centimetres of blood,

29:53.125 --> 29:54.625
a lake of blood.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.921
Then, there was a deathly silence,

29:57.796 --> 30:02.506
and it smelled like rotten chicken.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.760
- You OK, girls?
- Yeah.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.141
That's when Grandpa's dad,

30:08.265 --> 30:11.055
Rosaire, came out.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.225
Rosaire didn't hesitate.

30:13.353 --> 30:16.113
He smacked the raccoon on the head
with a shotgun.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.231
Did he die?

30:17.357 --> 30:19.357
lnstantly.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.030
He didn't suffer at all.
But that's not it.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.570
Rosaire pulled out a big knife,

30:26.700 --> 30:30.040
turned the raccoon around
to empty it before stuffing it,

30:30.162 --> 30:33.372
and shoved the knife
deep in its tooshie!

30:33.499 --> 30:35.329
Îœom!

30:35.459 --> 30:37.879
Rose must've told her
the raccoon story.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.253
With the knife deep in its tooshie!

31:08.617 --> 31:10.407
Why don't you tell them?

31:54.788 --> 31:57.208
Here, l'll give you a boost
for the road.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.473
Îœonique, come here.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.311
Come on!

32:13.557 --> 32:15.097
Lucie?

32:16.560 --> 32:18.690
Wait.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.650
Bunnies...

32:22.566 --> 32:25.066
- Here, Suzanne.
- Dad, you shouldn't have.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.573
Thanks, Dad.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.490
Later! Open them in the car.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.579
Thank you.

32:36.246 --> 32:37.196
l love you.

32:37.331 --> 32:41.501
- You too! Ah, my eldest...
- Girls!

32:42.336 --> 32:43.456
For the drive.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.087
We're driving to Îœontreal,
not Winnipeg.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.344
- lt'll go bad.
- l want that one.

32:50.427 --> 32:53.097
You gonna make it to Îœontreal
in this thing?

32:53.555 --> 32:56.515
l don't like my bunny
and little bunny driving in that.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.932
- Dad, please.
- lt's OK. lt's all fixed.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.651
Yeah, fixed...

33:04.566 --> 33:07.396
A tradition, a Beaulieu ritual:

33:07.944 --> 33:11.664
waving goodbye with any object
that flies in the wind.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.133
$1 5,000?

33:26.254 --> 33:29.054
"To help you buy your house."

33:32.302 --> 33:35.222
We're turning around.
Something's up. This is too much.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.847
This isn't right.
Usually it's $500.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.774
This is $1 5,000!

33:42.145 --> 33:46.185
- Don't you have anything to say?
- l don't know what to say!

33:46.316 --> 33:49.066
Your father wants to help us.
He can afford it.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.284
lt makes him happy.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.244
- We're going back.
- No, we're not.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.704
You know how stubborn he is.
lt'll just start a fight.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.118
l don't like it.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.503
l really don't like it.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.264
Are you all right?

34:42.664 --> 34:45.123
JULY

34:45.751 --> 34:48.041
lt's dark, slanted
and it smells funny.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.460
Well, the house
is over 1 00 years old.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.089
lt can't be too expensive.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.585
That's right!
lt's only $225,000.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.719
ls that in dollars or pesos?

34:57.846 --> 35:00.766
That's a good price
for a cottage in the Plateau.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.851
- Forget the Plateau.
- Come on, Rose.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.857
So, what do you think?

35:16.531 --> 35:17.911
Too small.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.993
Too ugly.

35:20.577 --> 35:21.907
Yes!

35:22.037 --> 35:23.447
Sold!

35:28.418 --> 35:31.878
- Do they live there?
- There aren't usually this many.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.590
These are the neighbour's guests?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.718
- This is ridiculous.
- Hello!

35:38.845 --> 35:39.845
We're leaving.

35:53.693 --> 35:56.113
We could get this one for $1 50,000.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.701
That's still a lot of money.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.867
Yeah, but we can pay it off
over 30 years.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.496
30 years?

36:08.875 --> 36:10.165
Dad, let's buy it!

36:15.674 --> 36:18.054
Please, Dad! Let's buy it.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.272
- Hello!
- Hi!

36:28.353 --> 36:30.653
You'll be taken care of.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.772
- l understand.
- You'll see.

36:34.484 --> 36:38.494
We're giving him a big sendoff
for his 40 years of loyal work.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.954
Your father was an artist.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.508
AUGUST

37:44.679 --> 37:47.059
Kids? lt's time!

37:57.317 --> 37:59.027
Don't move! Stay there.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.612
Excuse me. Thanks. Here!

38:01.738 --> 38:03.818
Rose! This is for you.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.407
Hang on.
Let's put this on right.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.708
l don't want to pull your hair.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.881
OK, let's spin!
Don't hit anything yet. Spin!

38:15.001 --> 38:16.421
Hey, everyone!

38:17.087 --> 38:20.087
Go for it!

38:21.841 --> 38:24.051
Go for it! This way!

38:25.303 --> 38:27.603
Swing! Just a little harder!

38:30.183 --> 38:32.733
You got it!
Yeah! Oh my God!

38:32.852 --> 38:34.902
You can do it!

39:07.095 --> 39:08.505
Îœy God!

39:09.222 --> 39:10.892
Roland!

39:13.268 --> 39:17.688
An attendant to Room 1 1 .
Attendant to Room 1 1 .

39:17.814 --> 39:19.574
Hold on.

39:22.360 --> 39:26.110
Roland had emergency surgery
for an intestinal obstruction.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.619
That's why he was vomiting so often.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.702
They operated on his intestine.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.037
That's why he was vomiting so often.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.123
He really gave me a scare.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.958
l hope he'll be all right.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.593
He looks good, Îœom.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.842
Suzanne, pass me
that box of cookies.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.384
Yeah.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.382
- This one!
- Thanks, Îœom!

39:48.553 --> 39:49.893
- Paul?
- No thanks.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.223
l hear you bought a new computer!

39:52.348 --> 39:54.518
Yes, a Îœac G3.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.562
350 ÎœHz processor,

39:56.686 --> 39:59.396
64 ÎœB of RAÎœ,
1 6 ÎœB of VRAÎœ, 1 0 GB,

39:59.522 --> 40:02.072
a FireWire port,
32x CD-ROÎœ,

40:02.192 --> 40:04.742
cache bus speed of 1 75 ÎœHz,

40:04.861 --> 40:07.401
Rage 1 28 video card,
standard 56k modem,

40:07.530 --> 40:09.280
Ethernet and three USB ports.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.868
What about your old computer?

40:11.993 --> 40:13.833
l'm sending it to Africa.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.123
l'll take it off your hands.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.367
- Really?
- Yeah!

40:17.499 --> 40:18.869
- Cookies?
- Yes please!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.460
- Îœrs. Beaulieu?
- Yes?

40:20.585 --> 40:22.995
Are you the family?
l'd like to speak with you.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.169
Now?

40:24.297 --> 40:27.667
Yes, l'm operating in a few minutes.
Please come with me.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.466
- All right...
- Girls?

40:31.513 --> 40:33.103
Watch the kids, OK?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.978
The operation
was a complete success.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.938
A short section
of the intestinal tract was removed.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.819
lt was a routine operation.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.066
OK, grandpa,
we're going to operate.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.158
Scalpel! Spoon!

40:51.282 --> 40:53.702
- Needle and thread!
- l don't like needles!

40:53.827 --> 40:55.987
- You'll be fine, Grandpa.
- No needles!

40:56.121 --> 40:57.621
You'll be fine.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.957
- lt hurts.
- l'm almost done.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.376
The operation was a success!

41:05.505 --> 41:06.545
Success!

41:06.673 --> 41:09.553
We'll have to start thinking
about putting Îœr. Beaulieu

41:09.676 --> 41:12.006
in palliative care.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.847
Whoa there!

41:13.972 --> 41:17.352
Why would you put him in palliative
for prostate cancer?

41:21.646 --> 41:22.646
Îœrs. Beaulieu?

41:32.448 --> 41:35.408
Your father doesn't have
prostate cancer.

41:36.828 --> 41:40.328
lt's pancreatic cancer,
but he didn't want to tell you.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.745
lt's an aggressive cancer.

41:44.377 --> 41:48.297
lt's advanced and can't be cured.
He has three months left, at most.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.216
l don't want to lose my father.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.980
Thanks, sweetie.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.851
Dad, drive!

43:02.914 --> 43:07.174
The Quickmaster 46
will be here in two weeks.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.633
Yeah, OK.

43:09.462 --> 43:11.052
lt's your kind of machine!

43:44.330 --> 43:45.960
Dammit!

43:51.546 --> 43:53.086
l...

44:28.082 --> 44:29.752
- This is--
- RÃ©al Godbout?

44:29.876 --> 44:32.036
- Îœr. Godbout is a cartoonist.
- l know.

44:32.170 --> 44:33.750
We're printing his next book.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.670
You'll take care of the scans.

45:03.993 --> 45:05.203
You all right?

45:05.328 --> 45:06.828
Yeah.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.398
- Hi, BenoÃ®t! How are you?
- Good, you?

45:32.522 --> 45:35.612
Good. Let me help you.
You got it?

45:35.733 --> 45:37.233
Yes. l'm fine.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.030
Thanks for this! This way.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.743
l need to get the lnternet for work.

45:41.864 --> 45:45.874
You can do that with this model,
but you'll need an external modem.

45:46.369 --> 45:49.409
l'd suggest the 1 200-baud Starshooter.

45:49.539 --> 45:50.619
ls it expensive?

45:51.124 --> 45:53.134
Around $1 00.

45:55.545 --> 45:58.045
- Hello?
- Hi, Paul! You called?

45:58.172 --> 45:59.842
Hi, Ben!

45:59.966 --> 46:04.176
We plugged the modem in,
but nothing's happening.

46:04.303 --> 46:06.853
Did you buy
any communication software?

46:07.807 --> 46:10.097
Get Eudora Pro version 3.0.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.266
ls it expensive?

46:11.394 --> 46:13.154
Around $1 00.

46:13.479 --> 46:16.059
Right. OK!

46:16.190 --> 46:18.610
Ben, the computer's not working
at all anymore!

46:18.734 --> 46:21.364
You need a better processor
for the new system.

46:21.487 --> 46:25.027
You should buy
a new Îœac like mine, a G3!

46:25.158 --> 46:27.618
- How much is that?
- 3,400 bucks.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.703
- 3,400!
- Bucks.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.332
He says we need a new one.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.461
We bought it,
but now we can't open the programs!

46:36.586 --> 46:40.126
Your computer's too fast.
You have to upgrade your software!

46:40.256 --> 46:42.466
Worthless damn machine!

46:43.342 --> 46:46.302
- l can't connect to the lnternet.
- Who's your provider?

46:46.429 --> 46:48.849
- Îœy provider?
- Yes, your provider.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.177
Click "Configure."

46:51.309 --> 46:52.349
Configure...

46:52.477 --> 46:55.937
Enter "1 234567" as your lPV4.

46:57.106 --> 46:58.056
Yes.

46:58.191 --> 47:03.281
For your lP,
enter 67.1 54.690.

47:04.739 --> 47:08.239
Next, under PPOE,
enter "Cybercom" as your provider.

47:08.367 --> 47:09.327
Yes.

47:09.452 --> 47:12.412
Next, do you have an email name?

47:13.664 --> 47:15.584
Please choose one.

47:16.417 --> 47:19.207
- Paul.
- Already in use. Choose another.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.417
- Lucie!
- Already in use. Choose another.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.508
Paul 2!

47:23.633 --> 47:25.433
Already in use. Choose another.

47:25.551 --> 47:29.301
PAULXW7896! How about that?

47:29.430 --> 47:31.970
Great choice! Congratulations,
you're now online.

47:32.099 --> 47:34.269
Thank you for using Cybercom.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.813
lt's working, goddammit!

48:50.553 --> 48:51.763
Roland?

49:26.714 --> 49:30.594
Darn it, Roland! l told you
to stay put until l got back.

49:30.718 --> 49:31.928
See what happens?

49:32.053 --> 49:34.763
l'm allowed to walk around
in my own damn house!

49:34.889 --> 49:38.269
Your stitches came open!
You stained your pyjamas.

49:38.392 --> 49:42.022
l'm at home.
l'll walk when and where l like!

49:42.146 --> 49:46.106
Stop being foolish!
You're acting like a 2-year-old!

49:48.903 --> 49:53.453
All right, let's get you
cleaned up and changed.

49:54.950 --> 49:57.620
Would you rather sit
on the toilet bowl sulking?

50:34.448 --> 50:36.068
Lisette!

51:12.278 --> 51:13.568
Hello?

51:13.696 --> 51:15.736
Hi, Lisette! How are you?

51:18.534 --> 51:21.164
Yes, just a second.

51:21.287 --> 51:22.327
She's crying.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.246
Hi, Îœom. What's wrong?

51:27.877 --> 51:30.497
l understand
why you're freaking out.

51:31.338 --> 51:33.468
That's normal, isn't it?

51:33.591 --> 51:35.591
Soon, he might be too sick

51:35.718 --> 51:37.798
for you to take care of him
on your own.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.848
We talked about this.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.693
lt might be time for him
to go to the PCC,

51:48.814 --> 51:50.364
don't you think?

52:43.869 --> 52:46.079
- Grandpa?
- Yes?

52:46.205 --> 52:47.995
What's a PCC?

52:48.123 --> 52:51.173
PCC: palliative care centre.

52:51.961 --> 52:54.461
What's palliative care?

52:54.880 --> 52:59.090
Palliative care: treatment
and psychological support

52:59.218 --> 53:02.218
provided to patients
at the end of their lives.

53:02.346 --> 53:03.756
That's what.

53:23.325 --> 53:25.075
SEPTEÎœBER

53:25.202 --> 53:27.542
Despite his misfortune,
Roland was very lucky

53:27.663 --> 53:30.293
to be admitted so quickly
to a centre like this one.

53:30.416 --> 53:34.536
They take in terminal patients,
but only have a few rooms.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.960
The atmosphere is completely
different from the hospital.

53:38.090 --> 53:41.130
The place emanates calm
and tranquillity.

53:52.521 --> 53:53.811
Hello!

53:56.150 --> 53:58.440
How are you this morning,
Îœr. Beaulieu?

53:59.987 --> 54:01.907
l'm dying, for Pete's sake!

54:02.740 --> 54:04.320
That's how l am!

54:04.450 --> 54:08.330
Oh my! Someone got up
on the wrong side of the bed!

54:08.829 --> 54:11.959
What's it gonna take
to put a smile on your face?

54:12.082 --> 54:15.082
Would you like some juice?
Coffee? Tea?

54:15.628 --> 54:18.128
First of all, don't
talk to me like l'm a baby.

54:19.214 --> 54:22.224
Second, l can still
take care of myself.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.925
l don't need some fatty
waiting on me!

54:36.607 --> 54:39.027
What are you drawing?
Naked women?

54:39.151 --> 54:40.941
No, nude girls!

54:42.571 --> 54:44.321
- Night.
- Night.

54:58.170 --> 54:59.340
Îœr. Beaulieu?

55:00.923 --> 55:04.843
How about l play you a song?

55:04.969 --> 55:08.219
Classical, pop, jazz,
country, Gregorian...

55:08.347 --> 55:11.717
What is this,
some kind of damn music camp?

55:11.850 --> 55:15.770
Go roll that piano
into oncoming traffic, little girl.

55:17.022 --> 55:18.062
Get the hell out!

55:53.350 --> 55:54.560
ls something wrong?

55:59.940 --> 56:03.190
They don't tolerate patients
insulting the volunteers.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.238
You can't act
like you own the place!

56:06.363 --> 56:08.033
You're sick, like everyone else!

56:08.157 --> 56:10.947
Remember, they can send you
back to the hospital!

56:11.076 --> 56:14.156
You won't get
the royal treatment there!

57:55.305 --> 57:56.885
Please.

59:16.136 --> 59:17.756
OCTOBER

59:17.888 --> 59:19.558
Red! Right, Dad?

59:19.681 --> 59:22.771
No, silver! lt's the best-selling
colour in the world!

59:23.393 --> 59:25.103
A Beetle convertible. Right, Dad?

59:25.229 --> 59:28.359
That's not practical, sweetie!
A station wagon. Right, Paul?

59:28.482 --> 59:29.822
But red! Right, Dad?

59:29.942 --> 59:32.572
You're dreaming, girls.
Our car's still going!

59:32.694 --> 59:34.954
- lt's 1 3!
- lt's older than me.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.862
The brakes and shocks are finished.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.950
Yeah, but ClÃ©ment can fix it.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.236
Dad, please!

59:40.369 --> 59:42.949
We'll even let you pick the colour.
Right, Îœom?

59:46.208 --> 59:48.828
lt's pretty awesome! Right, girls?

59:53.924 --> 59:55.264
Lisette?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.141
Can you put this one up too, please?

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.556
This looks like one of our old cars,
doesn't it?

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:12.021
Yeah.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.945
Roland had really calmed down.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:20.527
He had obviously
sorted out his emotions.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.914
Lisette was by his side
pretty much every day.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.750
Lucie and her sisters
shared the evenings.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:33.090
We were on rotation so Roland
wouldn't be alone for too long.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.680
l can't believe how tall
you're getting, Rose.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.721
l'm 1 .1 5 metres tall.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.180
1 .1 5 metres!

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.933
Tell me, little bunny,
how much is that in inches?

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:49.269
All right, l'm off!
l'm leaving you with your daughter.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.896
l'll go get caught up
on the washing and ironing.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:01:00.203
All our evenings with Roland
unfolded the exact same way.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.284
Shall we?

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.779
Yes.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.329
THE ClGARETTE

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:33.108
THE SCRABBLE GAÎœE

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.382
THE DEPARTURE

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:08.601
THE END

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:29.583
l'll be right back.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.093
Pretty awesome, huh?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.064
Bye, Ernest!

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.942
ls it Îœrs. ÎœcDuff's birthday?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.938
No, Îœary left us.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.530
She got better?

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:47.987
Come on, sweetie.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.190
We never showed you our new car,
Îœr. Beaulieu.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.026
- lt's great, Dad.
- Yeah.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.951
lt's nice that you're trying
to spare me,

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.701
but l already know
about Îœrs. ÎœcDuff.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.043
l picked it out.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:48.759
Did you notice
the racoons on it, Dad?

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:56.227
Would you like a cookie?

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:57.391
Here.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:04:59.189
lt has a cream filling.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.687
Yes?

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.855
Can l ask you something?

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.493
- Under your chin?
- Yeah.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.283
Turn.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.130
Are you gonna shave me?

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.877
l'm getting there.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.872
Paul...

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:55.989
Yes?

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.498
You can call me "Roland."

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:24.312
- Paul...
- Yes?

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:29.194
Are you ever going to
marry my daughter?

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.407
Come on.

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.626
- lt's late. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:33.296
Nothing?

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:42.064
- Night.
- Night.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:43.813
Love you.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:51.646
NOVEÎœBER

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.204
Hello?

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:12.458
The doctor said
Roland was getting worse

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.509
and that we should be
at his bedside.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.014
He didn't know
how much time he had left,

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:19.595
but he said we should come up soon,

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.810
because it might be
the beginning of the end.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.272
Why is Quebec City so freaking far?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.993
Excuse me. Can l have
a word with you, Îœrs. Beaulieu?

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.776
- Yes.
- You and your daughters.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.330
All right...

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.002
- Take the kids out.
- l'm going for a smoke.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.171
Rose, you stay
with your grandpa, OK?

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.674
Come on, kids.
We're gonna let Grandpa rest.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.971
Should we transfer him
to the hospital?

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.506
Will he lose consciousness?

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.100
Listen, your husband...

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.060
your father, is in a critical stage.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:15.233
He could let go and slip away fast,
or he could hang on...

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:18.490
Roland could let go or hang on.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.774
The ball was in his court,
so to speak.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.002
"Do you like soft caramels?

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:31.832
"Answer me. Do you or do you not
like soft caramels?"

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.840
"l, er... Soft caramels?
l... Yes, thank you, but..."

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:38.594
"Go out and buy six penny worth
of soft caramels!"

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.045
They have two rooms
for families here.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.389
We're gonna stay there.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.184
- And Lisette?
- She's exhausted.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:49.057
She spent three months here.
She needs to rest.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:52.975
BenoÃ®t's driving her home.
We'll call her if anything changes.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.976
- You'll call me too?
- Yes.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:01.818
Here's a present, Îœom.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.528
Thanks, sweetie!

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.451
- Buckle up.
- l will!

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.461
Dad?

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.048
Yes, sweetie?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.391
ls Grandpa going to die?

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:31.103
l think so, darling.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.312
Where will he go after?

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:41.993
Well...

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:53.535
His soul, his spirit,
will go up to heaven,

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.090
and he'll be able
to watch over us all.

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:05.643
He'll be happy there.
He won't be in pain anymore.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.971
And he'll have his new pyjamas?

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.772
He'll have his new pyjamas.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.255
l can't get any sleep in this place!

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:47.013
There's always someone
coming or going or a door closing.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.716
Well, people work here overnight.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.637
l hope Îœonique
was able to get some sleep.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:56.519
Good morning!

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.057
Hi, Îœo.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.729
So, how'd the night go?

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.859
Did Dad wake up?
Did he say anything?

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.397
Nothing. Niet. Nada.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.610
He didn't wake up once.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:11.082
His breathing is calm.
He snored a bit. That's all.

01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:13.622
Come on, girls.
Let's turn him over.

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:15.714
All right.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.214
Pull the slide sheet to the edge.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:21.998
Watch his legs.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.301
Not too far.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:26.795
His head.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:29.676
Hang on, Dad.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.563
Lucie...

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:34.683
Easy.

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:38.101
The pillow.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.782
He looks even thinner.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.115
lt's like he's melting.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:54.123
He looks like a little chicken.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.790
Hello.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.172
What exactly did your teacher say?

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:12.300
A hat from another country,
like a sombrero or a beret.

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:48.053
lt's Red Ketchup! We printed that.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.310
Hang on. l'll find another one.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:06.781
"A German tourist,

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:10.361
"whose husband abandoned her
in Las Vegas, finds refuge..."

Bagdad CafÃ©, 1 987,

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:15.905
with Îœarianne SÃ¤gebrecht.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.325
You're too good.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:19.664
Wait a second.

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:27.997
Do you want anything, Dad?

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.133
- Are you thirsty?
- Yes.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.098
Thank you.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.861
"A city policeman

Gilles Carle,
L'Ã‚ge de la machine, 1 978.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:05.036
OK! Time for sleep.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:15.085
- You see the Big Dipper?
- Yeah.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:20.135
Look closely,
right above the second star.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:22.768
Right above the second star,

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:25.814
there's a little star
that no one ever notices.

01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:27.944
Well, that star

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.528
belongs to your mother and me.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.951
lt's our star.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:38.703
Forever.

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.036
"Soft caramel."

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.630
That day, brothers and sisters,

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.140
cousins, friends, neighbours,
and former colleagues

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.095
were all invited by Lisette,

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:47.935
and everyone came
to pay Roland one final visit.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:51.691
- Îœr. Beaulieu?
- lt's time to take your medication.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.409
- BenoÃ®t?
- No thanks.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.445
Hey, ClÃ©m! Shrimp?

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:04.827
Yeah, l love these.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.710
lt's better like this, right?

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.590
You're ClÃ©ment, the mechanic?

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:15.012
That's right. Nice to meet you.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.168
Thanks, Îœonique.

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.465
Drink a little water, Dad.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.466
lf you ever need anyone
to watch Rose, we're around.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:27.019
lt'd be our pleasure.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:30.232
Îœy sweet Roland.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:41.702
- Kids, Rose, go outside.
- Can we bring the wheelchair?

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:45.044
No, it's not a toy.
Go on, and quietly!

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.461
No fair! We aren't allowed
to do anything here!

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:54.794
l love you.

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:04.347
Have a seat, Dad.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:24.914
That was nice, wasn't it?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.630
lt's freezing.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:43.219
lt's November.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:47.428
Well, my birthday was pretty much
forgotten this year.

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:50.096
Damn!

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.806
Sorry, Lucie.

01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:54.436
- Happy birthday, Lucie.
- Happy birthday!

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.323
lt's OK. There are
more important things going on.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:00.741
But l always remember
people's birthdays!

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.411
- l feel bad.
- Stop! lt's no big deal.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:14.921
Hey, l have pot.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:17.632
You wanna smoke a joint?

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.174
You smoke pot?

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:22.053
No!

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:25.434
A friend of ClÃ©ment's
gave us a little bag.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:27.552
lt'll be fun.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.971
Give me the rolling paper.

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:49.662
How are you doing?

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:56.332
l'm bored.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.007
How's the shop?

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.474
The Quickmaster jams all the time.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:32.741
l've been constipated
for three days.

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.118
What?

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:42.207
Nothing. lt's just
the way you said it.

01:20:43.214 --> 01:20:44.884
Well, it's true.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.182
l've been shitting pool balls!

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.796
lt hurts like hell.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.986
l'm the opposite. lt's too soft.

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:09.451
Îœy asshole's on fire
from wiping so much.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.960
l'm gonna pee my pants!

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.075
Put me to sleep.

01:22:10.718 --> 01:22:12.218
Put me to sleep!

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.185
Put me to sleep.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.441
Dad?

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.821
Dad, are you OK?

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:33.954
Dad?

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:38.866
Put me to sleep.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:44.707
Roland had made it clear
he didn't want to feel death coming.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:47.799
He didn't want to be aware
of his suffering.

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:54.843
He knew that when the time came,

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:59.560
they could give him something to
help him through that final ordeal.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.326
lf we give him morphine,
or whatever else,

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.251
we won't be able to talk to him, no?

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.088
He already sleeps
23 hours a day.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:35.680
Yeah, you're right.

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:37.263
We're coming.

01:23:38.389 --> 01:23:39.679
Love you.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.893
Love you.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.489
So?

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.620
lt's not the one l wanted!

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.081
That ring is for babies.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:07.460
He looks more relaxed, doesn't he?

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:09.923
He looks calmer.

01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:13.722
lt's as if he's smiling.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:27.771
His breath smells weird,
almost like paint thinner.

01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:30.732
His metabolism
is entering its final phase.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:33.323
The ketones and acids

01:24:33.444 --> 01:24:35.864
are starting to eat
the inside of--

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:38.358
lt's all right, Suzanne.
We get it.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.154
Look at this.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.896
Cool!

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:23.827

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.921
- Îœom?
- What, sweetie?

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:21.129
Grandpa's moving his finger!

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:27.755
"Someone dies,
and it's like footsteps cease.

01:28:27.886 --> 01:28:30.886
"But what if it were
the start of a new journey?

"Someone dies,

"But what if it helps us hear
the fragile music of life?"

- Grandpa?
- Yes, sweetheart?
