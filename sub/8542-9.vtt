WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.264
[instrumental music]

00:07.833 --> 00:08.791
Hey.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.578
So I'm pulling turf
out of my teeth, right?

00:13.665 --> 00:16.973
We're on our own 8 yard line.
Third and 25.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.757
The crowd's hollering
for our blood, right?

00:18.844 --> 00:20.455
Hey, Doc.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.066
So I look over at the guys

00:23.153 --> 00:26.156
and I say, "gentlemen..."

00:26.243 --> 00:29.638
I believe we got 'em
right where we want 'em

00:29.725 --> 00:31.944
Hey, I wanna get you guys
another round. Right?

00:32.032 --> 00:35.209
Still gotta pay for it,
but I'm gonna get it for you.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.863
- Here you go, Doc.
- Hey, thanks.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.996
Hey. Hey. Just booked
a guest spot Thursday.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.432
Oh.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.260
Who's the greatest
agent in the world?

00:43.347 --> 00:44.566
You are, Alex.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.873
Star quarterback to TV star.
Just wait.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.485
Good man, Jakey.
And you're my biggest fan,

00:50.572 --> 00:53.009
Say, you and I go
talk some business.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.663
Busy, busy, busy.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.231
[indistinct chattering]

01:06.370 --> 01:08.938
[horn blaring]

01:09.025 --> 01:10.983
[man]
Yo, Doc! You're the best!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.333
'Hey, how about an autograph?'

01:12.420 --> 01:13.899
Alex, you seen the big man?

01:13.986 --> 01:16.206
Got a question about
that fan expo in Florida.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.426
Yeah, he's just leaving.
You might catch him.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.471
- Thanks, man.
- Alright, Steve.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.734
[explosion]

01:26.564 --> 01:29.089
[indistinct chattering]

01:30.307 --> 01:31.874
[man #1]
'Did you see anything?'

01:31.961 --> 01:34.964
[man #2]
'No, stay back!'

01:35.051 --> 01:36.400
Oh, Doc!

01:40.056 --> 01:42.493
[intense music]

01:43.712 --> 01:46.193
[siren blaring]

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
Agent Wainright,
Lisbon's on her way over.

01:50.588 --> 01:51.937
What about Rigsby?

01:52.024 --> 01:54.288
Apparently, doc was killed
with a car bomb.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.333
Rigsby's in San Francisco
for court.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.030
Who's Doc?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.207
I thought you knew.
Our victim's Doc Dugan.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.079
You know, the..

02:03.166 --> 02:04.472
Is that football?

02:04.559 --> 02:06.604
Uh... yeah.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.084
Doc Dugan is dead.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.607
And to make matters
more interesting,

02:09.694 --> 02:11.914
one of our witnesses put
the explosion on YouTube.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.134
- It's gone viral.
- Well, welcome to the future.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.570
They promise us jet packs

02:15.657 --> 02:17.920
they give us
compromised investigations.

02:18.007 --> 02:22.359
Look, I'll, I'll take care of
the media. You guys just go..

02:22.446 --> 02:23.404
...solve the case.

02:24.622 --> 02:27.234
[police radio chatter]

02:31.151 --> 02:33.196
Traffic on the 5, Cho?

02:33.283 --> 02:35.067
You recognize my footsteps.
That's weird.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.634
Van Pelt saw
someone she knew.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.941
She didn't do the "boss is
here" posture check.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.335
Rigsby's away.
Therefore, Cho.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.688
Agent and manager saw
the whole thing.

02:46.775 --> 02:49.865
Agent and manager
for a sports bar owner.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.563
Well, even you know
who Doc Dugan was.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.609
Someone rich and famous
and full of himself,

02:54.696 --> 02:55.914
judging by the ride.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.873
Doc Dugan is
one of two quarterbacks

02:57.960 --> 02:59.701
to throw 50 touchdowns
in a year

02:59.788 --> 03:03.139
and the only one to throw over
3,000 yards in eight seasons.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.098
He's a local boy. Retired two
years ago, opened that bar.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.491
Football star.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.193
He ever win the big game?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.281
2003.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.240
Excuse me.

03:22.289 --> 03:25.205
- You're the agent?
- Manager. Steve Penn.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.076
I'm the agent.
I'm Alex Sodko.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.601
Listen, I think I saw somebody
running away after the blast.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.386
I think I saw him, too.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.605
Did Doc have a place
nearby somewhere

03:34.692 --> 03:36.781
where he could be alone?

03:36.868 --> 03:38.043
He's got an office--

03:38.130 --> 03:41.046
Not an office.
A-a privateplace.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.397
There's a studio apartment
down the block.

03:43.484 --> 03:44.963
He used it as a guesthouse.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.530
Take me there right now.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.923
Alright. This way.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.319
what's this about?

03:52.406 --> 03:55.322
A victim's private places
tell you a lot about 'em.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.802
I gotta hunch we'll find
a better than average lead.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.282
Like what?

03:59.369 --> 04:01.284
Oh, his championship ring,
for starters.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.332
[intense music]

04:07.638 --> 04:09.249
Doc?

04:09.336 --> 04:10.554
What the hell?

04:10.641 --> 04:12.991
Ah, like I said, the ring
for starters.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.646
And, of course,
there's the..

04:17.387 --> 04:18.519
...better than average.

04:21.565 --> 04:24.264
[theme music]

04:30.835 --> 04:32.750
[horn honks]

04:32.837 --> 04:35.840
[man #1]
'Yo, Doc! Come back!
Hey, how about an autograph?'

04:35.927 --> 04:37.625
[explosion]

04:37.712 --> 04:38.669
ohh!

04:40.323 --> 04:41.455
Oh, poor Jakey.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.762
[sighs]

04:44.849 --> 04:46.286
[Lisbon]
You didn't hear the explosion?

04:46.373 --> 04:48.375
Huh? Yeah, I heard it.
I was busy.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.550
[sighs deeply]

04:49.637 --> 04:50.986
I should be dead.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.423
Somebodyis.
Tell us about Jake.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.034
He was Doc's assistant
for the past year or so.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.471
He's a great kid.

04:57.558 --> 05:00.909
I loved that kid.
I-I loved that kid.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.346
I'll never find
another assistant like that.

05:03.433 --> 05:07.045
Why was Jake driving your car
and wearing your jacket?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.134
Oh, I was dodging a subpoena.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.614
Another lawsuit?

05:11.702 --> 05:12.964
You didn't tell us that.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.010
Well, Anna's looking
for more money.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.186
- Who's Anna?
- My ex-wife.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.449
Look, Jake and I look
like each other,

05:19.536 --> 05:22.974
so sometimes I'd have him
go out and cover my trail.

05:24.672 --> 05:25.803
Poor Jake.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.239
[cell phone ringing]

05:27.327 --> 05:29.459
Oh, it's a reporter.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.853
Well, he's about to get
a great scoop.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.507
Doc Dugan lives.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.858
Give that, please. Excuse me.
Thank you. Hello.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.686
[Jane]
'Which paper you with?'

05:38.773 --> 05:41.210
This is Patrick Jane
with the CBI.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.473
[Jane]
'California Bureau
Of Investigation.'

05:43.560 --> 05:44.996
Oh, you heard
Doc Dugan's dead?

05:45.083 --> 05:46.607
[inhales]
Yeah.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.173
Uh really, really dead.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.175
Wicked witch of the west dead.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.612
[Jane]
'Okay. Alright.'

05:51.699 --> 05:53.614
Thank you. I'm sorry. Bye.

05:53.701 --> 05:54.745
What was that?

05:54.832 --> 05:56.660
- I'm not dead.
- Yes, you are.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.183
Think about it.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.663
The people in this room

05:59.750 --> 06:01.926
are the only people that know
he's still alive.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.015
We've never had
a live murder victim before.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.496
- So?
- So embrace it.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.804
How many times during a case we
wished we talk to the victim?

06:09.891 --> 06:11.632
Are you crazy?
What about them?

06:11.719 --> 06:14.461
Well, tell 'em Doc left
and then the bomb went off.

06:14.548 --> 06:18.682
I don't know, Doc. This is, uh,
this is a little out there.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.989
- A little?
- I don't want to play dead.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.643
Do you wanna
catch the killer?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.688
Huh? Do you want
to catch the killer?

06:24.775 --> 06:26.734
Okay, then trust me.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.824
We will run a trick play
they will never see coming.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.223
- Let's do it.
- Splendid.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.096
We'll hide you
in a spare office at the CBI.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.924
Won't Wainright
have a problem with that?

06:43.011 --> 06:44.491
Uh, well, we--we won't tell him.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.493
What he doesn't
know won't hurt him.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.278
Compile a list of friends and
family for Lisbon to interview?

06:49.365 --> 06:51.454
No. No, what about
Jake's next of kin?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.761
Oh, I-I have to tell
his mother.

06:53.848 --> 06:56.154
[Jane]
'No, no, no.
You stay out of sight.'

06:56.241 --> 06:57.504
What do you say, Lisbon?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.027
Huh? What do you say?

07:06.164 --> 07:12.170
Mrs. Stewart, I know it's a lot
to ask but I'm asking.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.216
Will you let us
make it look like

07:14.303 --> 07:17.262
it was Doc that died in the
explosion and not your son?

07:21.397 --> 07:23.312
If you say no,
we won't do it.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.536
Will it help you catch
my son's killer?

07:29.623 --> 07:32.364
I can't promise you that
but that's our hope.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.499
But first,
I have to ask you

07:38.675 --> 07:40.155
do you think
it was possible

07:40.242 --> 07:42.462
that Jake was
the intended victim?

07:44.376 --> 07:45.334
No.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.860
It's impossible that anyone
would want to hurt my son Jake.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.299
Doc, on the other hand--

07:54.386 --> 07:55.953
He had a lot of enemies.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.041
[sighs]

07:58.913 --> 08:00.828
Let me put it to you
this way.

08:02.351 --> 08:03.744
There are only two people

08:03.831 --> 08:07.182
in the world
who really loved Doc Dugan.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.053
One of them was my son.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
The other one was Doc himself.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.237
[sighs]

08:19.324 --> 08:20.412
Two days.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.981
You got two days.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.159
And then I intend
to bury my son.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.512
[intense music]

08:35.340 --> 08:37.647
You're the agent
and you're the manager.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.214
There's a difference.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.520
You're the enforcer

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
and you,
in your jeans and blazer

08:42.826 --> 08:44.785
are the hand holder,
the enabler.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.831
[chuckles]
The enabler. You're pretty good.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.746
Managers are more one-on-one.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.661
I've been with Doc
since the beginning.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.054
You played a little ball.

08:53.141 --> 08:57.188
Yeah. Till my knee took me
out. Then I saw Doc,

08:57.275 --> 08:59.974
college kid with one
of the best arms I've ever seen.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.237
I said I'll take
him to the promised land.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.368
Touching story.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.851
You're the mercenary.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.636
I get things done.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.638
It's been two years
since Doc's been out.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.291
It's time for a comeback.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.946
Steve thinks that having a house
full of signed memorabilia

09:16.033 --> 09:17.644
makes for a pension plan.

09:17.731 --> 09:21.604
Meanwhile, I'm out getting him
endorsement deals, TV deals--

09:21.691 --> 09:24.128
And he's modest, too.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.782
I see.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.524
Agent Lisbon will interview
everyone that ever met Doc

09:28.611 --> 09:31.440
so, uh, let's save her
some time.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.572
Who killed him?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.010
Nobody would want
to hurt doc.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.751
No. Everybody loved him.

09:37.838 --> 09:41.581
Liars, both of you.
But I suppose it's your job.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.495
Close your eyes.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.062
Just close 'em.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.108
Doc's dead.
Who do you think killed him?

09:47.195 --> 09:50.590
On the count of three,
say who. One, two..

09:52.374 --> 09:53.941
three. Who?

09:54.028 --> 09:55.682
- Marie St. Claire.
- Marie St. Claire?

09:56.900 --> 09:59.947
Yeah, doc's girlfriend.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.209
Can't wait to meet her.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.345
- 'Agent Lisbon.'
- Sir.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.957
Doc's agent sent over some
of the threats he'd received.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.785
Some of them jumped out at me.

10:11.872 --> 10:14.439
Uh, "I want to see
Doc taken out back and..."

10:14.526 --> 10:16.485
- Ooh.
- Oh.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.878
"Someone should
rip off his..."

10:19.706 --> 10:20.837
You get the idea.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.883
All signed by "megafan8."

10:22.970 --> 10:25.189
Number 8--
That's Doc's jersey number.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.757
Fan sending hate mail.
I'll get Cho on to it.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.934
Good. Weren't you
just heading upstairs?

10:31.021 --> 10:32.806
No, no. Of course not.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.199
I don't know
what I was thinking.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.245
Make sure you get
enough rest, Agent Lisbon.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.986
- It's good for the brain.
- Yes, sir.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.773
[intense music]

10:47.298 --> 10:51.215
[male commentator on TV]
'An athlete,
a leader, and a champion.'

10:52.913 --> 10:55.480
'The world says good-bye
to one of the greats.'

10:56.264 --> 10:57.395
[knock on door]

10:59.180 --> 11:02.662
I haven't been on television
this much since I retired.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.926
Turns out the best day of your
life's the one after you die.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.059
We've just been going
through your list.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.629
The list of people
who might want to kill you.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.457
You left your ex-wife off.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.068
What's the big whoop?

11:18.155 --> 11:19.983
Typically,
in a murder investigation

11:20.070 --> 11:23.378
detective likes to decide what
is and is not a big whoop.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.859
Fine.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.296
Name's Anna Favreau.
I have her number.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.037
Alright.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.213
Is there anybody else
we should talk to?

11:32.300 --> 11:33.954
Um...

11:34.041 --> 11:37.000
What about Marie St. Claire?
She's on her way in here now.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.002
She's your girlfriend, right?

11:39.089 --> 11:41.570
"Girlfriend" is a word
that I don't like to use.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.703
- Uh, we're friends.
- She lives with you, no?

11:44.834 --> 11:47.358
Sometimes I have her over.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.926
Look, if you want to bring
Marie in, that's fine,

11:50.013 --> 11:53.190
But it's gonna be hard to watch.
Woman's crazy about me.

11:53.277 --> 11:54.409
She'll be heartbroken.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
I think I can handle it.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.027
[man on TV]
'There's no doubt that sports..'

12:04.114 --> 12:05.768
How's the trial?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.336
They bumped me till tomorrow
which is fine by me.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.033
You know I hate that stuff.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.079
Sarah has work here, we're
heading to Chinatown

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
get a little
egg foo yongaction.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.691
She's helping me
prep for the trial.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.041
Cool. So did you see
the lab reports?

12:20.391 --> 12:22.524
- Say again?
- 'The lab reports?'

12:22.611 --> 12:25.396
Oh, yeah, your bomb. Uh, looks
like a pretty standard IED

12:25.483 --> 12:27.355
no exotic parts or chemicals.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.878
Skillful amateur
could have built it.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.532
Gotcha. Thanks.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.534
- Okay. Thanks. You good?
- Yeah.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.409
What's your relationship
with Doc Dugan, Miss St. Claire?

12:39.454 --> 12:40.716
I can't believe he's gone.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.501
He was my rock, you know?

12:44.241 --> 12:45.590
Just my rock.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.854
when was the last time
you spoke to him?

12:47.941 --> 12:49.072
"Her rock."

12:49.899 --> 12:52.249
Your own funeral--

12:52.336 --> 12:55.775
That's when you hear the truth,
what people really think of you.

12:57.646 --> 12:58.821
Woman worships me.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.216
Would you like
to find out why?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.045
No, thanks.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.571
You sure?

13:11.399 --> 13:13.967
Tempting, really, but...

13:14.054 --> 13:15.795
Ishot and killed
my last boyfriend.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.709
I'm not ready
for a relationship yet.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.408
Okay.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.192
Rain check.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.850
Hi.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.678
How long had you
been seeing Doc?

13:31.898 --> 13:35.075
Just before
his marriage went south.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.991
I'm not a home-wrecker.
Anna didn't love him.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.907
Once he wasn't a big
football star, she ignored him

13:41.864 --> 13:43.257
and I didn't.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.042
Marie, Patrick Jane.
Nice to meet you.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.525
What do you think happened
with the diamond pendant?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.005
What diamond pendant?

13:52.092 --> 13:53.745
What diamond pendant?

13:53.833 --> 13:57.010
The $50,000 diamond pendant
Doc charged to his credit card

13:57.097 --> 13:59.229
[Jane]
'six days ago.'

13:59.316 --> 14:00.578
That's lies.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.233
I assumed if you had it,
you'd be wearing it.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.846
Yeah. I knew it.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.110
I knew it.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.635
I knew that son of a bitch
was cheating on me.

14:13.722 --> 14:17.769
I was cheating on her, but
I--there was no diamond pendant.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.164
Self-satisfied bastard acted

14:21.251 --> 14:23.210
like God's gift to women.
News flash--he wasn't.

14:23.297 --> 14:27.518
He was a dumb ex-jock heading
downhill, but you know what?

14:27.605 --> 14:30.695
This is actually all
a blessing because now..

14:30.782 --> 14:32.959
I, can go find a man

14:33.046 --> 14:35.700
who might possibly love me
as much as he loved himself.

14:38.616 --> 14:42.142
Hmm. Marie,
uh, your, uh

14:42.229 --> 14:44.318
lunacy is the lunacy
of an innocent woman.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.624
Unless agent Lisbon
has more questions for you

14:46.711 --> 14:47.799
you're--you're free to go.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.410
- No.
- Oh, and by the way

14:49.497 --> 14:52.021
I don't want you to fret, uh,
over nonexistent jewelry.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.588
There was no diamond pendant.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.330
I made that up just
to make you mad. Carry on.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.339
[Cho]
There you are.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.167
Everybody needs
a little downtime.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.604
That's wisdom
from the mind of Doc Dugan.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.649
I've tracked megafan8
to an online sports forum.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.956
- Looks like he's local.
- Can we get an ID?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.741
I can get a court order,
to reveal the user's info.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.266
There's not enough time.
Jake's mom gave us two days.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.529
Doc's college team
has a game today.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.835
There's a memorial to Doc
during the halftime show.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.446
Megafan8 says
he's gonna live-tweet it.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.970
We get him there,
but how do we find

15:28.057 --> 15:30.712
a single sports freak in
the middle of a football game?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.540
Jane will figure it out.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.107
[Lisbon]
You were suing your ex-husband?

15:34.194 --> 15:36.936
My lawyer thought
he was hiding money from us.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.938
Any idea who might
have killed him?

15:39.025 --> 15:42.593
Nope. Thought about it
myself, but..

15:42.680 --> 15:45.901
you would have, too,
if you'd been married to doc.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.599
- The other women.
- Oh, yeah.

15:48.686 --> 15:51.211
Although I should probably send
that Marie a thank-you card.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.516
Why?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.127
For taking him away from me.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.218
I met Trevor in college,
and he was..

15:58.305 --> 16:01.569
...driven, strong.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.614
You know
how attractive that is.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.791
When the fame and money came,
he handled it all.

16:06.878 --> 16:07.967
Then it ended.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.101
He'd spent his whole life
becoming a star

16:12.188 --> 16:13.885
and never thought
about what came after.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.671
He changed.

16:16.758 --> 16:20.370
He had all these holes
that he'd dug in himself,

16:20.457 --> 16:23.069
and he had to find ways
of filling them.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.200
[Anna]
'That bar.'

16:25.158 --> 16:26.768
Drugs. Other women.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.206
I was sick of it.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.253
Did you kill him?

16:33.340 --> 16:35.820
I didn't kill Trevor,
Agent Lisbon..

16:37.692 --> 16:41.826
but..I don't have a lot
of tears for him, either.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.046
Lisbon's wondering
if I'm making a face at her.

16:45.874 --> 16:46.875
Interesting woman,
your ex-wife.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.051
[Doc]
Yeah, interesting.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.360
I thought hearing
what everybody had to say

16:53.447 --> 16:54.622
about me would be fun.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.277
Truth's rarely fun.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.977
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have your funeral to go to.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.851
[indistinct chattering]

17:06.938 --> 17:09.419
[commentator]
'ordinarily, game day
is a happy occasion.'

17:09.506 --> 17:11.726
'However, this is a tribute
and dedication'

17:11.813 --> 17:14.946
to a very special player.
So at this stadium

17:15.034 --> 17:17.427
where Doc thrilled fans
in his college years

17:17.514 --> 17:20.778
they have gathered
for one last cheer.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.911
Let's find our megafan8,
shall we?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.783
Doc Dugan--
Doc Dugan jersey?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.437
I got football--
Doc Dugan jersey?

17:27.524 --> 17:30.658
Doc Dugan jersey? Come on.
Doc Dugan jersey?

17:30.745 --> 17:33.617
Got footballs, too. $800.
Signed genuine article--

17:33.704 --> 17:34.792
$800 for a football?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.403
Yeah, it's a limited supply.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.405
It's not like Doc's gonna
sign anything else

17:38.492 --> 17:40.233
you may get it
while it's hot.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.278
Matter of fact,
I got a ticket stub

17:42.365 --> 17:44.367
from his last game.
Give me 25 bucks.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.848
Well, that's not signed.
Here, give me this.

17:46.935 --> 17:53.333
- Hey, man. You can't do that.
- "Doc Dugan." there you go.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.248
Whoa. $500.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.902
Tickets for Doc Dugan
signed by theDoc Dugan.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.643
$500 ticket stub.
Anybody...

17:59.730 --> 18:01.471
Megafan8 is here.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.604
He's tweeting that
he's starting to tailgate.

18:03.691 --> 18:08.261
[Jane]
'Okay. Uh, "dear megafan8,'

18:08.348 --> 18:09.697
"you're loudmouthed jerk

18:09.784 --> 18:11.699
"overcompensating
for childhood issues."

18:14.310 --> 18:16.225
we'll start with that
and build.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.228
- Any nibbles?
- No.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.883
Okay, let's dangle
another worm, shall we?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.667
"You talk big on the internet

18:23.754 --> 18:26.192
"because you're
a chicken-stuffed

18:26.279 --> 18:27.758
"loser in
your real life."

18:32.372 --> 18:35.375
"You better shut your mouth
before I shut it for you."

18:35.462 --> 18:37.072
"Move out of
your mother's basement

18:37.159 --> 18:38.421
"and join the real world."

18:40.815 --> 18:42.208
"I'm warning you, dumbass.
Shut up."

18:43.600 --> 18:46.081
Okay, tell him
I'm near gate 4, and, uh,

18:46.168 --> 18:47.735
"if you wanna shut me up

18:47.822 --> 18:50.825
you better put down
your baby blanket and do it."

18:50.912 --> 18:53.654
Yo, yo. Genuine Doc Dugan
t-shirt right here, right here.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.786
Genuine Doc Dugan. $500.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.572
"Bring it, bro."

18:58.659 --> 19:01.096
Say I'm wearing a red
sweatshirt, black baseball cap

19:01.183 --> 19:03.359
with a "J" he can have
the first punch

19:03.446 --> 19:05.666
"that's how pathetic
I think you are."

19:05.753 --> 19:06.797
"Pathetic."

19:07.842 --> 19:10.323
I'm getting worked up.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.064
[Cho]
'And he just went off-line.'

19:13.152 --> 19:16.981
- M-maybe we should get ready.
- For what?

19:17.068 --> 19:19.462
"J" for "jackhole," right?
Hey, you sweatshirt!

19:19.549 --> 19:21.464
I'm talkin' to you.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.118
Oh. Okay, Cho.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.294
I'll show you pathetic.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.297
[grunting]

19:28.384 --> 19:30.560
Get on your stomach.
Gimme your arms.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.215
- Gimme your arms!
- I didn't do anything.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.912
Megafan8, I presume.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.176
Nice entrance.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.747
[crowd cheering]

19:43.834 --> 19:47.751
I don't know why you're
harassing me.I was provoked.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.362
Yeah, we provoked you.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.407
You've said some pretty
rough stuff about Doc.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.627
Why do youcare?
It's not like Imatter.

19:57.892 --> 20:00.329
You threatened a man's life.
Now he's dead. It matters.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.986
[Cho]
'You sure have a lot
of pictures of Doc.'

20:05.073 --> 20:06.117
Doc was my hero.

20:07.554 --> 20:11.601
The way he threw, he moved--
it was perfect.

20:11.688 --> 20:12.646
You're a stalker.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.039
No. I'm a fan.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.390
I was his biggest fan.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.653
And I wanted him
to understand that. That's it.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.830
I went to that bar

20:22.917 --> 20:24.614
and he said, "not now, kid."

20:26.007 --> 20:28.879
"kid."
And that was it.

20:28.966 --> 20:33.797
I own a ball he signed
from the 2004 conference finals.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.277
It cost me 2 grand!

20:38.193 --> 20:39.238
"Not now, kid."

20:41.240 --> 20:43.154
So I wrote the e-mails.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.201
You know this man?

20:46.288 --> 20:47.376
[Megafan8]
'No. Who's that?'

20:52.381 --> 20:56.167
Arnold Green, local luminary
of organized crime.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.519
So what? People come up to me
and shake my hand every day.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.397
Stalkers make good detectives.

21:08.484 --> 21:12.096
It turns out your
number one fan had an alibi

21:12.183 --> 21:14.360
[Lisbon]
'so it's lucky for him.'

21:14.447 --> 21:16.971
Green's been connected with
illegal gambling, point shaving.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.582
Alright, so..

21:19.669 --> 21:23.499
I knew him, but just for hanging
out, is all not gambling.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.153
[chuckles]

21:25.240 --> 21:27.895
I'm sorry. Terrible liar.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.985
Alright, I made a few bets
with him, but never on football.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.509
Huge lie.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.164
Never on my own team.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.908
Okay, but no point shaving
and no games thrown.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.432
I bet to win, I played to win,
every time.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.260
How much better
does that feel, huh?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.349
Get that big secret
out there?

21:47.436 --> 21:49.395
Why wouldn't you
just tell us that, Doc?

21:49.482 --> 21:52.180
Look, if I sign something,
it's worth a lot of money.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.661
My manager, Steve, has
a roomful of the stuff.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.751
How much is my autograph
gonna be worth if this gets out?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.754
I laid some bets with Green,
but when I retired, I quit.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.146
That was it.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.800
[Teresa]
'But Green had other plans.'

22:03.887 --> 22:06.063
No. Not green.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.024
'This guy.'

22:10.111 --> 22:12.635
Martin.

22:12.722 --> 22:16.247
Tough guy.
See that bracelet he's wearing?

22:16.335 --> 22:19.381
That's the bullet that punctured
his lung. This is a bad dude.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.904
What did Martin do?

22:20.991 --> 22:23.211
He demanded I buy
Green's liquor for my bar.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.735
It was way overpriced.
I told him to take off.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.694
You told off a mobster.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.479
Somebody tried to kill you,
and you don't even mention it?

22:30.566 --> 22:32.481
You're as helpful as
an actual murder victim.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.135
Hey, these are tough guys

22:34.222 --> 22:37.225
but they're not gonna hurt
Doc Dugan. We're friends.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.966
- Kinda.
- Right.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.490
Alex and Steve said they saw
somebody feeling the scene.

22:41.577 --> 22:44.667
It could've been
one of Green's guys.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.235
Maybe we should bring Doc Dugan
back from the dead

22:47.322 --> 22:50.151
'wire him up, and then listen
to a conversation with Green.'

22:50.238 --> 22:52.196
- A wire?
- Oh, I got a better idea.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.590
Maybe we need
the other end of the wire

22:54.677 --> 22:56.375
the listening device.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.072
Could come in handy.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.508
'Okay.'

22:59.595 --> 23:00.596
[clearing throat]

23:05.558 --> 23:07.734
Okay. Who has Chinese food
for breakfast?

23:07.821 --> 23:10.867
Chinese people.
And me.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.392
Okay.
Interrogation time.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.132
Agent Rigsby

23:15.219 --> 23:18.658
do you consider yourself
an expert on motorcycle gangs?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.095
- I guess.
- No, don't say, "I guess."

23:21.182 --> 23:23.010
Say, "Yes."
You want to project confidence.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.055
Yes, ma'am.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.448
- Aw.
- Mm.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.015
Don't try to distract me.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.582
And does this expertise

23:29.669 --> 23:31.148
come from years
of close contact

23:31.235 --> 23:32.933
with criminal elements
in your own family?

23:33.020 --> 23:34.500
- Hey.
- Don't say, "Hey."

23:34.587 --> 23:37.328
- Just answer the question.
- No. It doesn't.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.374
Isn't it true that
your father, Steven Rigsby

23:39.461 --> 23:42.377
was a member of
the Iron Gods motorcycle gang?

23:42.464 --> 23:43.596
Yes.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.424
So wouldn't it
be fair to say

23:45.511 --> 23:48.252
everything you learned, you know
from your father, the felon?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.472
[sighs]

23:50.559 --> 23:53.257
Babe, I know it's touchy
but if you wait too long--

23:53.344 --> 23:54.607
I think that's enough.
Thanks.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.566
- It's time to get to court.
- Wayne.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.568
Seriously, it was a big help.
Thank you.

23:59.655 --> 24:00.656
[scoffs]

24:00.743 --> 24:02.310
[man clearing throat]

24:04.486 --> 24:05.879
[indistinct chattering]

24:08.621 --> 24:09.970
Arnold Green?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.757
Oh, that's
a great-looking suit

24:14.844 --> 24:17.673
for a policeman.
Most of you have no taste.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.892
I'm not a policeman.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.633
- She is.
- Yes.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.419
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.
This is Patrick Jane.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.986
Would you like a drink?

24:26.073 --> 24:28.597
We're here to talk to you
about Doc Dugan's death.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.382
- We know you know him.
- Oh, this is official. Okay.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.560
Well, my attorney's name is
Don Hendricks. Give him a call.

24:34.647 --> 24:37.258
You wanted Doc to start
buying liquor from you.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.173
I'm a liquor distributor.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.916
Maybe Doc didn't want to.
You didn't like that.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.396
Did you try blackmailing him?
When that didn't work--

24:45.484 --> 24:47.050
Okay, let's just say

24:47.137 --> 24:50.706
that I'm this scary guy
that you imagine me to be.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.491
You think I couldn't
put the fear

24:52.578 --> 24:54.275
'into some
puffed-up pretty boy?'

24:54.362 --> 24:57.060
If I wanted him to buy,
he was going to buy.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.366
Why should I kill him?

24:58.453 --> 25:00.411
He's worth more to me
alive than dead.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
Excellent point. Thank you.
Really helpful.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.807
Lisbon, we can go.
We have what we need.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.113
Next time, call my attorney.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.767
Oh, one more thing.

25:07.854 --> 25:10.334
- Arrest this man.
- For what?

25:10.421 --> 25:13.120
- I don't know. For questioning.
- That's not arresting.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.904
Sir, we're gonna call you
for questioning.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.645
I got nothing to say.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.169
I'm sure we can think
of something to talk about.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.001
[clicking]

25:29.789 --> 25:31.181
[muttering]

25:31.268 --> 25:33.227
We're getting set up
for Martin. You ready?

25:33.314 --> 25:37.274
Almost. I think I might need
some more CBI stationary.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.320
Yeah. Oh.
That's a good--

25:39.407 --> 25:41.148
Hey, I was drinking that.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.280
Oh, sorry. Works very well.
Look at that.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.762
Aging. Very authentic.
Very authentic.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.156
I love arts and crafts.
It really relaxes me.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.984
Just a little more
of that.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.638
[exhales deeply]

25:52.725 --> 25:56.032
Rigsby. Ah.
Uh, welcome back.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.469
Yes.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.471
Is that Katy Perry
over there?

26:00.559 --> 26:01.603
[camera shutter clicking]

26:01.690 --> 26:03.953
Nice.
Uh, don't smile.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.825
What's the capital
of Idaho?

26:05.912 --> 26:07.435
- Uh..
- Quick, quick, quick.

26:07.522 --> 26:08.784
Uh, Boise?

26:08.871 --> 26:10.656
Bingo.
Time to raise the dead.

26:10.743 --> 26:15.486
Oh. Let that paper dry.
It's very important. Thank you.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.618
What's going on here?

26:18.141 --> 26:19.839
You good cop
or the bad cop?

26:19.926 --> 26:22.058
Oh, I'm not a cop.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.103
I'm a psychic.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.584
Sure you are.

26:25.671 --> 26:28.456
We have Doc Dugan with us.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.763
He's kind of mad at you.

26:30.850 --> 26:31.938
Doc Dugan is here?

26:32.025 --> 26:33.461
Mm-hmm.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.116
Yes, right there
in that chair.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.252
I'm locked in here
with a loon.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.298
Wait till my lawyer hears
about this one.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.778
Nice bracelet.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.607
It's the bullet
that didn't kill you, right?

26:50.260 --> 26:52.436
- How do you know about that?
- Doc told me.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.656
The hell he did.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.049
You're a fruitcake,
aren't you?

26:56.136 --> 26:57.703
Ask him a question.

27:01.489 --> 27:05.145
We had lunch once at this place,
some red tablecloth joint.

27:05.232 --> 27:08.191
What'd I order?

27:08.278 --> 27:10.237
Steak. Bloody.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.630
Yeah, big deal.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.762
Well, it's your question.
Ask a harder one.

27:16.156 --> 27:19.202
[sighs]

27:19.289 --> 27:21.161
[Martin]
'Who was playing
at the restaurant?'

27:21.248 --> 27:22.336
[Doc]
'It was Motown.'

27:22.423 --> 27:24.251
Motown.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.600
Always a great choice.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.297
Or a good guess.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.041
Last time we were together,
what'd I say to him?

27:33.260 --> 27:35.523
Um..

27:35.610 --> 27:36.829
uh, change the subject.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.875
Doc doesn't want
to talk about that.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.268
It unsettles his spirit.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.836
Yeah, I knew
you were full of it.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.448
Alright, let's do it.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.841
He came to see me.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.104
He was wearing
a gray leather jacket

27:51.191 --> 27:54.977
black t-shirt, some kind of
lizard skin cowboy boots.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.240
You wore a gray leather jacket,
a black t-shirt

27:57.327 --> 27:59.721
and lizard skin
cowboy boots.

27:59.808 --> 28:02.115
Crocodile boots, yeah.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.246
How'd you know that?

28:03.333 --> 28:06.075
You spoke
with a gravelly voice

28:06.162 --> 28:10.123
like you had a cold
or a flu or something.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.430
He took out his knife
and he..

28:13.517 --> 28:14.780
...held it against my throat.

28:14.867 --> 28:17.870
You held a knife
to his throat.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.742
He started to cry.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.831
You laughed at him.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.051
Called him a girlie-man.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.444
And.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.360
I said

28:30.447 --> 28:32.188
"Don't cut my face, please."

28:34.103 --> 28:36.410
He said,
"Don't cut my face, please."

28:38.542 --> 28:39.587
He's really here.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.545
Doc. Doc, you here?

28:41.632 --> 28:43.286
[clattering]

28:43.373 --> 28:45.898
Look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, Doc, okay?

28:45.985 --> 28:47.900
Calm down, Doc.

28:47.987 --> 28:50.859
Tell us everything you know
about Doc, Green, extortion

28:50.946 --> 28:53.383
car bombs. It's the only way
to make it stop.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.342
Just get him out of here, okay?

28:55.429 --> 28:57.518
You know what
you have to do.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.302
I know what to do.
I'll talk!

28:59.389 --> 29:01.478
- Just get him outta here!
- Good.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.833
Martin confessed to extortion,
ratted out his boss as well.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.052
So Green's going down.
Great job, buddy.

29:10.139 --> 29:11.619
But did they kill Jake?

29:11.706 --> 29:14.404
Martin claims he had nothing
to do with the car bomb.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.711
He said there were
some very dangerous men

29:16.798 --> 29:18.147
'at the club Green owns.'

29:18.234 --> 29:21.063
Now one of them
is Louis "Louie Boom" Corrado.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.370
We've got a big file on him.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.502
He's been implicated
in almost a dozen murders

29:25.589 --> 29:27.113
all of them bombings.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.201
That sounds promising.

29:28.288 --> 29:29.463
Can I just--

29:29.550 --> 29:31.770
You said you saw
a guy fleeing the scene.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.772
Bring in Louie
for a line-up.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.774
You see his picture,
it taints the ID.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.166
Can I go with you?

29:37.253 --> 29:39.299
Put a SWAT helmet
on me or somethin'?

29:39.386 --> 29:41.214
Sorry. Jane's got
other plans for you.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.609
[door opening]

29:45.696 --> 29:47.611
[telephone ringing in distance]

30:01.147 --> 30:03.236
[groaning]

30:03.323 --> 30:05.847
[container cap clicking]

30:05.934 --> 30:07.544
[pills rattling]

30:19.818 --> 30:22.951
[chuckling]
Does Jane know
you're on his couch?

30:23.038 --> 30:24.257
You hurt your back again?

30:24.344 --> 30:25.562
[sighs]
I'll be fine.

30:25.649 --> 30:26.999
Oh, yeah.
What'd you do?

30:27.086 --> 30:29.610
[sighs]
Tackled a suspect.

30:29.697 --> 30:32.004
You shouldn't tackle people
with you back like that.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.744
[sighs]
Thanks.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.268
We're gonna go
raid the vespers.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.531
Lisbon says to stay here,
man the phones, okay?

30:37.618 --> 30:38.619
Okay.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.758
San Francisco
kind of sucked.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.325
Mm-hmm.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.675
I asked Sarah to help
prep my testimony.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.635
It turned into a fight.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.812
Iturned it into a fight.
She brought up my dad.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.466
Right.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.337
She just goes straight
for the jugular.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.643
She's tough, you know?

31:02.730 --> 31:04.340
She doesn't
look it, but..

31:04.427 --> 31:07.082
When she brings it,
she's as tough as any of us.

31:07.169 --> 31:10.912
You should see
her in court.

31:10.999 --> 31:15.221
She's tearing up a witness,
just really goes to town on 'em.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.613
It's pretty awesome.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.269
'She was doing exactly
what I asked her do.'

31:21.749 --> 31:24.970
I got mad 'cause
she was doing it so well.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.449
I'm such an idiot.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.060
Thanks for listening.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.325
[snoring]

31:34.675 --> 31:37.765
Mr. Green. Nice of you
to show up. You're under arrest.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.549
This is harassment.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.639
No, it's a raid. Your friend,
Martin, turned over a new leaf.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.815
You were under it.
Ron, cuff him.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.339
Hey, boss.
We arresting the bartender?

31:46.426 --> 31:48.167
Why not?
The more, the merrier.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.914
[door opening]

31:56.915 --> 31:58.960
Coast is clear.
Come on.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.092
Where are we heading?

32:00.179 --> 32:01.484
To solve the case.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.225
Didn't we just do that?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.316
Come on, man.
I'm getting so tired of this.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.362
I found out
my relationship is a sham

32:09.449 --> 32:11.190
all my friends
think I'm a punk.

32:11.277 --> 32:14.236
Now you got somebody else who
wants to dump on Doc Dugan.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.326
Truth hurts, I know.

32:17.413 --> 32:18.893
It's biologically-based,
actually.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.200
Our brains process sound
faster than they do light

32:21.287 --> 32:22.766
but light moves
faster than sound.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.551
So our brains are
constantly shifting reality

32:24.638 --> 32:25.813
so the world syncs up.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.249
So?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.556
Only when someone is
standing 30 yards away

32:29.643 --> 32:32.341
do we see and hear the world
exactly as it is.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.126
That's when your brain,
sound, and light

32:34.213 --> 32:35.692
are all in perfect harmony.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.782
The rest of the time,
we're living in a world of lies.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.002
Lies are what make
the world make sense.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.961
Ergo, the truth hurts.

32:51.230 --> 32:54.363
No, no, no, not Anna.
No, no. Nah-nah. No way.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.191
- Have a seat.
- 'Not again.'

32:58.759 --> 32:59.890
I can't.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.892
I know, but sit.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.462
My name is Patrick Jane.
I saw your interview

33:06.549 --> 33:08.029
with Agent Lisbon.
Interesting stuff.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.378
[Anna]
'Is there a problem?'

33:09.465 --> 33:11.293
Yes, there is.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.339
The problem is
you were telling a lie.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.428
Is this about my alibi?
'cause I can--

33:15.515 --> 33:16.995
Nothing to do
with your alibi.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.258
You said you hated
your ex-husband

33:19.345 --> 33:22.913
'but clearly that's
not the case.'

33:23.001 --> 33:26.613
Hey. Here's the file
on the mob bomber, Louie Boom.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.442
Lisbon says give it a read
before we bring him in.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.922
Alex, would you
come with me, please?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.707
[door opening]

33:33.794 --> 33:35.491
We need to go over
your statement.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.450
Oh, yeah, sure.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.671
You don't even know me.

33:41.758 --> 33:43.978
I could see through
half an inch of glass.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.850
You're deeply in love
with your dead ex-husband.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.809
What business is it
of yours?

33:48.896 --> 33:50.854
Just tell me the truth.

33:50.941 --> 33:51.942
Just say the truth.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.120
Fine. You're right.

33:56.512 --> 33:59.080
I loved him.

33:59.167 --> 34:03.476
Somewhere deep down in him was
the good man I used to know.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.218
It got lost when
he retired, but..

34:06.305 --> 34:09.264
he would have found
his way back.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.657
I know he would have.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.964
And now I'll never
see him again

34:14.052 --> 34:16.054
'and I'll never
get to tell him.'

34:19.405 --> 34:20.580
Okay.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.800
Well, that should do it.

34:25.802 --> 34:26.977
Hey, wait.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.112
- Leave her alone.
- Okay.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.375
- Trevor?
- Annie.

34:33.462 --> 34:35.464
What, what are you..

34:35.551 --> 34:38.032
- They said, I thought..
- A trick.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.382
To catch the killer.
I just blew it.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.557
What?

34:41.644 --> 34:44.299
I'm sorry.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.954
I'm so sorry
about everything.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.086
[groaning]

34:53.961 --> 34:55.397
The guys from vespers
are downstairs.

34:55.484 --> 34:56.964
- Did he go for it?
- Yep.

34:57.051 --> 35:00.620
- Did he go for what?
- Sir.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.230
[indistinct chattering]

35:02.317 --> 35:04.928
Doc Dugan is still alive?

35:05.015 --> 35:06.408
Yes, sir.

35:06.495 --> 35:10.586
'It was his assistant,
Jake Stewart, that died.'

35:10.673 --> 35:12.893
And you chose to hide
this fact from me.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.678
From everyone, for the sake
of the investigation.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.988
- A trick.
- I wouldn't call it a trick.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.513
- Did this work?
- It's still in progress.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.602
Okay, well, um..

35:29.562 --> 35:31.477
Let's hope it turns out
positively, huh?

35:31.564 --> 35:32.652
Yes, sir.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.397
Do you think he would mind
if I got an autograph?

35:38.484 --> 35:39.659
Just a..

35:42.357 --> 35:46.187
Yeah. I'll just..
You know, give them a second.

35:47.406 --> 35:48.450
Good idea, sir.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.553
Any one of these guys

36:04.640 --> 36:07.513
looks like the man you saw
running from the explosion?

36:07.600 --> 36:08.644
You mean Louie Boom.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.907
I mean the man you saw.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.996
I can' tell you
which one is Louie.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.650
It'll taint the lineup.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.609
That's him. Number four.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.397
That's the guy
from the parking lot.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.617
You're sure?
That's Louie?

36:24.704 --> 36:25.879
That's the guy.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.622
Rigsby, come on in.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.976
- Hey, guys.
- He saw me.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.847
- Can he do that?
- We're all friends.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.240
What's going on here?

36:39.327 --> 36:41.677
I'm special Agent Rigsby.

36:41.764 --> 36:44.202
Oh, then, I must have
made a mistake.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.725
You wanted to ace
the test

36:45.812 --> 36:48.554
so you took a little peek.
I made the test.

36:48.641 --> 36:51.339
I made the whole thing up.
There is no "Louie Boom."

36:51.426 --> 36:54.516
[Teresa]
'We gave you a chance
to look, and you took it.'

37:00.914 --> 37:02.394
You said Martin talked.

37:02.481 --> 37:05.266
He said there was no way
Green was behind Doc's death.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.137
Lot of people
didn't like Doc

37:07.225 --> 37:09.923
but most of them made
more money if Doc was alive.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.578
Only Steve here made
more money with Doc dead.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.755
You have a house filled
with memorabilia signed by Doc.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.887
He dies, the prices
go through the roof.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.106
You make a fortune.

37:19.193 --> 37:20.455
Come on.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.152
I saw somebody running away.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.372
- It was an explosion.
- People run from explosions.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.418
Your prints on that file
should be enough

37:26.505 --> 37:28.681
to get a search warrant.
Let's have a look.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.422
The truth
shall set us free.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.554
Well, maybe not all of us.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.179
Where am I going?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.964
Booking, for the murder
of Jacob Stewart

37:51.051 --> 37:52.748
and the attempted murder
of Trevor Dugan.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.794
We found bomb residue
in your garage

37:54.881 --> 37:56.404
and research
in your web history.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.451
Add that to the fact that you
tried to frame Louie Boom.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.975
Hey!

38:02.062 --> 38:04.238
There's a roomful of it
back at your place.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.500
'Stuff signed by me'

38:05.587 --> 38:09.461
packaged to sell
after I'm dead.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.940
I thought we were
friends, Steve.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.246
Friends?

38:12.333 --> 38:13.813
Friends 'cause I get
your coffee?

38:13.900 --> 38:16.598
Because I cover up
every mess you make?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.992
Hide your girlfriend
from your wife?

38:19.079 --> 38:21.255
What'd you ever do for me?

38:21.342 --> 38:23.692
Gave you a job, man.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.999
I was the number one
draft pick.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.175
It should be me
wearing that damn ring.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.872
Youshould beworking for me!

38:29.959 --> 38:32.919
So you built a bomb and you
stuck it on Doug's car.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.051
I just wanted what
was coming to me.

38:35.138 --> 38:39.229
I never meant for Jake to die.
He was a good kid.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.970
Alright, that's enough.
Take him away.

38:42.755 --> 38:44.147
Let's go.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.205
Let me get that.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.598
[door closing]

38:59.685 --> 39:01.687
Wanna take a seat?

39:04.646 --> 39:06.692
Look, I, uh..

39:06.779 --> 39:08.737
I wanted to say I'm sorry
about yesterday.

39:08.824 --> 39:11.784
It's just.. Well, you called me
a dirty cop, Sarah.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.916
Oh, God, I would
never call you that.

39:14.003 --> 39:16.397
I was trying to prepare
you for the defense lawyer.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.573
Yeah, I know.
Thank you.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.619
The trial was
a breeze compared to you.

39:20.706 --> 39:23.012
- Oh, you did good?
- Yeah.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.537
I know you can't help it.
You're a defense attorney.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.103
What's that supposed
to mean?

39:27.190 --> 39:31.499
Oh, come on. You guys
protect criminals for money.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.327
Is that what you
think we do?

39:33.414 --> 39:35.808
Tell me, what is it
exactly that cops do?

39:35.895 --> 39:38.898
We put the bad guys away
if we can get around you.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.466
Sometimes you put
away good guys.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.815
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.860
We have to deal
with cops every day

39:44.947 --> 39:46.340
who can't even
spell "Miranda."

39:46.427 --> 39:48.777
I'm gonna do whatever
I can for my client.

39:48.864 --> 39:50.823
Now do you have
a problem with that?

39:50.910 --> 39:54.609
No.
No problem at all.

39:54.696 --> 39:55.654
Mmm.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.396
[both moaning]

40:03.226 --> 40:07.796
We got him, Mrs. Stewart,
thanks to your help.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.799
No, you're the one
that deserves the thanks.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.235
Doc, too.

40:12.322 --> 40:13.889
'He was really useful.'

40:13.976 --> 40:17.589
I'd like to pay
for Jake's funeral if I can.

40:17.676 --> 40:19.199
Anything else you need.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.723
Thank you, but I don't need
handouts, Mr. Dugan.

40:21.810 --> 40:25.640
Call me Trevor, please,
and it's not a handout.

40:25.727 --> 40:26.989
It's what I owe Jake.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.211
Alright, then.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.431
Thank you. Thank you.

40:37.217 --> 40:40.481
I'd like to stay
a little longer if I can.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.004
Sure.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.529
Again, I am so sorry
for your loss.

40:47.314 --> 40:48.489
[door opening]

40:48.576 --> 40:50.752
I was hoping we could

40:50.839 --> 40:53.712
talk a little bit more
about Jake.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.148
Sure.

40:55.235 --> 40:57.672
I hear he was one hell
of a ballplayer himself.

40:57.759 --> 41:00.806
Yeah, he won the state
championship.

41:00.893 --> 41:04.113
- Senior year, yeah.
- No.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.158
Hey.

41:05.245 --> 41:06.376
All good?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.379
Yeah. Doc seems like
a changed man.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.643
He's had a perspective
few of us ever get.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.645
Energizing, I expect.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.168
Would you want that?

41:15.255 --> 41:17.736
To hear what people say
about you when you're dead?

41:17.823 --> 41:20.086
When I'm dead, they can
burn me in effigy

41:20.173 --> 41:23.263
or build a statue or forget
about me completely.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.308
- I couldn't care less.
- You don't mean that.

41:25.395 --> 41:26.919
Everybody wants
to be remembered.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.835
- Childish vanity.
- I want to be remembered.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.359
You shall be, fondly,
but you won't care about it

41:32.446 --> 41:33.882
because when you're dead,
you're dead,

41:33.969 --> 41:36.102
and until then
there's ice cream.

41:36.189 --> 41:38.452
[silverware clattering]

41:46.982 --> 41:48.593
Mmmm.
