Hmm.
Specially tinted windows.

Nice try, Norman, but I can
see right through them.

Just like I can see
right through you.

What?

01:07.987 --> 01:11.214
Was Norman the one who got Harry
kicked out of Horizon High?

01:11.541 --> 01:14.608

safe from that maniac.

01:14.829 --> 01:16.417

Harry, the proper level
of hydration

06:31.327 --> 06:33.272

06:43.903 --> 06:46.752
a failsafe frequency
for your mechanical arms?

06:46.903 --> 06:50.522
You know, in case one of them
wasn't in sync with the others.

06:50.670 --> 06:52.928
Originally,
it was 47 gigahertz.

06:53.015 --> 06:57.272
But now that they're a part of me,
there's no need for such a thing. Why?

06:57.452 --> 07:00.280
Oh, I was just looking
for areas to improve.

07:00.476 --> 07:03.342
Thought an Osborn contribution
might raise the bar.

07:03.452 --> 07:06.452
The bar has been raised
as high as it can go, Norman.

07:06.675 --> 07:09.657
And besides, now that these
arms are a part of me,

07:09.887 --> 07:12.264
I couldn't think of sharing
them for corporate gain.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.881
Oh. Yes.

07:15.444 --> 07:19.342
I understand.
Uh, but keep the option open.

07:19.849 --> 07:22.920

get back to your class.

07:26.653 --> 07:29.913

I'm preoccupied for a while.

11:33.913 --> 11:35.966
But if I can get him

"Dumb as a Rhino."

Remember me?

11:42.520 --> 11:44.654
Oh, I guess you do.

13:55.685 --> 13:58.450
You'll rue the day
you entered this school!

13:58.598 --> 14:03.035
Science created you,
but science will bring you down!

14:04.512 --> 14:06.184
Dr. Octavius is right.

14:06.252 --> 14:09.957
He's protecting the school with his tech.
We should do the same.

14:17.504 --> 14:21.465
In the name of Oz Academy,
attack!

14:22.082 --> 14:24.785
The students and
faculty are fighting back!

14:29.571 --> 14:32.077
Whoo! That's
a sinister-looking group.

14:32.145 --> 14:35.375
When I woke up this morning,
I did not see this team-up happening.

14:35.443 --> 14:38.926
But I'll take help where I can get it.
Let's take back the school!

14:39.217 --> 14:41.442
Wait, Spider-Slayer, don't!

14:46.480 --> 14:49.176
The Rhinos are still people,
remember?

14:50.258 --> 14:51.926
Impressive!

14:52.173 --> 14:55.559
To think, all of this
to stop me.

14:55.801 --> 14:58.598
It didn't have to be
like this, Norman.

14:58.793 --> 15:00.864
I came to you first.

15:01.169 --> 15:04.020
You could've created
the spider army with me

15:04.122 --> 15:08.035
instead of working so hard
to stop it.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.879
We can still work together,
Raymond.

15:11.582 --> 15:13.428
It's "Jackal"!

15:13.715 --> 15:16.746
And you've proven
you can't be trusted.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.020
Then there's no way
you're leaving the premises.

15:20.426 --> 15:25.692
Oh, I had no intention
of leaving.

15:30.419 --> 15:33.005
You're an artificial replibot.

15:47.883 --> 15:50.781
Vulture, send me
a sonic blast!

16:03.941 --> 16:06.980
That looks like the transmitter
Aleksei tried to put on me earlier.

16:07.048 --> 16:09.839
That must be how the Jackal
is controlling the Rhinos.

16:12.003 --> 16:15.660
Everyone! Jackal's using
transmitters to control the Rhinos!

16:15.728 --> 16:18.894
Let's work as a team
to remove the devices.

16:26.457 --> 16:30.005
Hmm. Jackal's serum
turned them into Rhinos,

16:30.191 --> 16:33.753
but he used mind control
to get them to do his bidding.

16:34.253 --> 16:36.168
Genius.

16:44.906 --> 16:48.980
Wh... Where am I?

16:49.769 --> 16:51.244
Oz Academy.

16:51.652 --> 16:53.628
Well done.

16:53.996 --> 16:57.565
I am impressed with
this little Oz security group.

16:57.996 --> 16:59.816
Perhaps we should
give it a name.

16:59.965 --> 17:03.050
The Osborn Commandos,
perhaps.

17:03.199 --> 17:04.972
The "Osborn Commandos"?

17:05.097 --> 17:08.074
Wh... What exactly
did you contribute, Norman?

17:08.199 --> 17:11.311
Me? I destroyed the Jackal.

17:11.675 --> 17:13.988
Whoa! Way to go, Dad!

17:14.127 --> 17:16.425
Should we have security
apprehend his partner?

17:16.574 --> 17:18.457
No. No, son.

17:18.613 --> 17:21.040
I think Spider-Man
has proven himself today.

17:21.253 --> 17:23.451
Not only by fighting
alongside us,

17:23.530 --> 17:28.589
but by becoming a permanent member
of the Osborn Commandos, perhaps?

17:28.971 --> 17:31.795
No, thanks, Norman.
I'll fight my own battles.

17:31.863 --> 17:34.014
And since this one's over,
I'm gonna get outta here

17:34.082 --> 17:36.878
before you show
your true colors.

17:37.746 --> 17:40.175
Otto, I owe you an apology.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.729
I shouldn't have worked on your
tech without your knowledge.

17:42.917 --> 17:46.600
From now on, you will head up
the Oscorp Octobots division.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.941
There will be
no Octobots division, Norman.

17:50.011 --> 17:53.144
This tech is mine
and mine alone.

17:54.722 --> 17:57.390
You should've read
your contract, my friend.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.480
You see, anything you
use under my employ

18:00.567 --> 18:03.792
is owned by Oz Academy.

18:08.021 --> 18:11.699
Then soon
I will own Oz Academy.

18:14.199 --> 18:17.261
Pete, you okay?
Yeah.

18:17.457 --> 18:20.652
I figured I'd be better off staying out
of sight until things calmed down.

18:20.761 --> 18:24.089
Well, I hope you caught some of it,
because it proves my dad's a good guy.

18:24.253 --> 18:27.605
He even offered Spider-Man
a spot on the Osborn Commandos.

18:27.785 --> 18:31.925
Harry, it's an act.
And I found the proof.

18:35.964 --> 18:37.480
No. No!

18:37.652 --> 18:42.011
It was here! A roomful of
things to eliminate Spider-Man.

18:42.667 --> 18:46.230
Huh. A roomful, huh?
That would've been helpful.

18:46.378 --> 18:49.027
And the evidence
that my dad set me up?

18:49.292 --> 18:51.831
Probably destroyed
with everything else.

18:53.386 --> 18:54.782
Unfortunate.

18:55.019 --> 18:57.264
You know, Pete,
I invited you to Oz Academy

18:57.332 --> 18:59.839
so you could see the good side
of Norman Osborn.

19:00.019 --> 19:01.849
At least that
didn't fall short.

19:02.069 --> 19:04.178
I know what I saw, Harry.

19:04.816 --> 19:08.654
And I know what I saw...
Spider-Man working for the Jackal!

19:08.722 --> 19:11.707
He's not, Harry.
He's a friend.

19:12.691 --> 19:13.605
Funny.

19:13.745 --> 19:15.677
That's the same thing
Spider-Man said.

19:15.837 --> 19:19.173
Which makes me wonder
why you care so much about him.

19:20.657 --> 19:23.087
Harry,
the absolute truth is...

19:25.634 --> 19:29.072
my loyalty is to you,
not to Spider-Man.

19:29.329 --> 19:33.767
But if your dad is willing to threaten
Spider-Man's life, then he's crossed a line.

19:34.103 --> 19:36.212
People are not always
who they seem to be.

19:36.337 --> 19:39.275
And I just want you to know
who you can trust.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.864
Well, that's always
been you, Pete.

19:43.329 --> 19:45.886
So if my best friend says
he sees something that I don't,

19:45.954 --> 19:48.384
no matter how crazy
it may sound,

19:49.259 --> 19:51.900
maybe I need to look
a little closer at things.

19:52.396 --> 19:54.868
Maybe even a closer look
at Spider-Man.

19:56.657 --> 19:58.767
That's all I'm asking.

20:02.611 --> 20:06.892
You picked a pretty eventful day
to visit Oz Academy, Mr. Parker.

20:07.095 --> 20:09.261
Although I shouldn't
be surprised.

20:09.329 --> 20:12.220
Chaos usually surrounds
your business associate.

20:12.376 --> 20:13.736
"Business associate"?

20:13.868 --> 20:15.556
Yes. Didn't you know?

20:15.720 --> 20:19.251
Your friend here
is in business with Spider-Man.

20:19.462 --> 20:21.220
He makes his tech for him.

20:21.361 --> 20:23.814
You're working for Spider-Man?

20:23.993 --> 20:24.993
I...

20:25.134 --> 20:26.876
I don't believe you!

20:27.118 --> 20:29.470
You looked me right
in the eye and said,

20:29.587 --> 20:32.345
"My loyalty is to you,
not to Spider-Man."

20:32.501 --> 20:34.470
But really you were just
pushing his agenda?

20:34.538 --> 20:37.626
No! It's not like that!
I just...

20:37.759 --> 20:39.025
You're right, Pete.

20:39.212 --> 20:41.308
People aren't
who they seem to be.

20:41.548 --> 20:43.510
Now get out.
But...

20:43.704 --> 20:45.812
Get out!

20:53.743 --> 20:55.275
Harry, what am I doing?

20:55.439 --> 20:59.107
Is it possible to be your best
friend <i>and</i> keep secrets from you?

20:59.524 --> 21:01.685
Norman lies to you,
and I call him a villain.

21:01.753 --> 21:05.236
But... is what I'm doing
any different?

21:06.251 --> 21:10.595
I have to tell you the truth.
I have to tell you I'm Spider-Man.

21:13.275 --> 21:15.790
But I can't, can I?

21:16.111 --> 21:18.907
Not when Norman is set
on destroying Spider-Man.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.114
Because if he's
willing to frame you

21:21.201 --> 21:23.142
and get you kicked out
of Horizon High,

21:23.301 --> 21:27.228
then there's no telling what he'd do
to you to get to your best friend.

21:27.806 --> 21:29.856
But I won't give up
trying to convince you

21:29.935 --> 21:32.509
who's on the side
of right and wrong.
