WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.509
Planet Earth.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.717
This is where I was born,

00:08.634 --> 00:10.807
and this is where I died.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.728
The first 79 years of my
life, nothing happened.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.526
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.573
Not ever.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.238
And then I met a man called the Doctor.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.115
Run!

00:32.573 --> 00:34.622
A man who could change his face.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.792
And he took me away from home
in his magical machine.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.838
He showed me the whole of time and space.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.638
I thought it would never end.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.809
How long are you going to stay with me?

00:55.639 --> 00:56.936
Forever.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.938
<i>That? what I thought.</i>

01:04.605 --> 01:06.779
But then came the army of ghosts.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.404
Then came Torchwood and the War.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.748
And that's when it all ended.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.666
This is the story of howl died.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.062
Mum, it's us! We're back!

02:21.975 --> 02:25.320
Oh, I don't know why you bother with that phone.
You never use it.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.988
Shut up, come here.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.408
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you so much!

02:29.483 --> 02:31.281
Oh, no, you don't. Come here!

02:32.611 --> 02:35.160
Oh, you lovely big fellow!
Oh, you're all mine!

02:35.238 --> 02:38.412
- just... just put me down!
- Yes, you are!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.919
I've got loads of washing for you.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.420
And I got you this.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
It's from the market on
this asteroid bazaar.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.962
It's made of...

02:50.087 --> 02:51.464
- What's it called?
- Bazoolium.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.558
Bazoolium. When it gets cold, yeah,
it means it's gonna rain.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.603
When it's hot, it's gonna be sunny.
You can use it to tell the weather.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.521
I've got a surprise for you and all.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.065
I get her bazoolium,
she doesn't even say thanks.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.517
Guess who's coming to visit?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.479
Youâ€™re just in time. He'll be here at ten past.
Who do you think it is?

03:06.561 --> 03:08.108
- I don't know.
- Oh, go on, guess.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.940
No, I hate guessing. just tell me.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.446
It's your grandad, Grandad Prentice.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.489
He's on his way any minute.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.414
Right. Cup of tea.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.585
- She's gone mad.
- Tell me something new.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.872
Grandad Prentice, that's her dad.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.129
But he died, like, 10 years ago.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.716
Oh my God, she's lost it.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.138
Mum?

03:34.256 --> 03:38.011
- What you just said about Grandad...
- Any second now.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.765
But he passed away.
His heart gave out. Do you remember that?

03:41.847 --> 03:44.225
Of course I do.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.777
- Then how can he come back?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.281
Ten past, here he comes.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.496
Here we are, then.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.328
Dad, say hello to Rose.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.501
Hasn't she grown?

04:13.587 --> 04:14.964
They're everywhere.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.048
- Alex.
- You can play if you want to.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.220
Doctor, look out!

04:25.432 --> 04:27.025
You haven't got long.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.525
Midday shift only lasts a couple of minutes.
They're about to fade.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.231
What do you mean, "shift"?

04:32.314 --> 04:34.442
Since when did ghosts have shifts?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.822
Since when did shifts have ghosts?
What's going on?

04:36.902 --> 04:39.826
Oh, he's not happy
when I know more than him, is he?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.283
No one's running or
screaming or freaking out.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.742
Why should we?

04:43.867 --> 04:46.370
Here we go. Twelve minutes past.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.866
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce

05:23.949 --> 05:27.704
we've just measured the Ghost Energy
at 5,000 gigawatts.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.084
Give yourselves a round of applause.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.342
On today's ghostwatch,

05:34.417 --> 05:37.762
<i>claims that some of the ghosts
are starting to talk,</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:42.475
and there seems to be a regular formation
gathering around Westminster Bridge.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.991
It's almost like a military display.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.304
What the hell is going on?

05:45.428 --> 05:48.022
And tonight we're expecting
very strong ghosts

05:48.098 --> 05:51.568
from London, through the north,
and up into Scotland.

05:51.893 --> 05:56.490
So basically, Eileen, what you're telling
me is that you are in love with a ghost?

05:56.731 --> 06:01.032
He's my ghost and I love him, 24/7.

06:01.236 --> 06:02.954
Well, no one needs me any more.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.248
My ghost was pale and grey,

06:05.323 --> 06:09.169
until I discovered Ectoshine!

06:22.299 --> 06:23.642
It's all over the world.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.765
<i>Listen to me, Den Watts,</i>

06:25.844 --> 06:28.563
I don't care if you have
come back from the grave,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.231
[gel' out of my pub]

06:30.307 --> 06:33.026
The only spirits I'm serving in this place

06:33.101 --> 06:36.196
are gin, whisky and vodka.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.987
So you heard me. Get out!

06:40.358 --> 06:41.826
When did it start?

06:41.902 --> 06:45.452
Well, first of all, Peggy heard this noise
in the cellar, so she goes down...

06:45.530 --> 06:47.999
- No, I mean worldwide.
- Oh!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.668
That was about two months ago.
Just happened.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.715
Woke up one morning and there they all were.
Ghosts everywhere.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.757
We all ran round screaming and that.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.554
Whole planet was panicking.
No sign of you, thank you very much.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.718
Then it sort of sank in.

07:02.839 --> 07:06.264
Took us time to realise that we're lucky.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.183
What makes you think it's Grandad?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.181
It just feels like him.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.768
There's that smell, those old cigarettes.
Can't you smell it?

07:15.226 --> 07:17.024
I wish I could, Mum, but I can't.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.946
Well, you've got to make an effort.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.865
You've got to want it, sweetheart.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.076
And the more you want it,
the stronger it gets?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.494
Sort of, yeah.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.579
Like a psychic link.

07:26.696 --> 07:30.496
'Course you want your old dad to be alive,
but you're wishing him into existence.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.794
The ghosts are using that
to pull themselves in.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.041
You're spoiling it.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.875
I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's no smell,
there's no cigarettes.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.084
Just a memory.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.511
But if they're not ghosts,
what are they, then?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.463
Yeah, but they're human.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.514
You can see them. They look human.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.970
She's got a point. I mean, they're all sort
of blurred, but they're definitely people.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.396
Maybe not.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.692
They're pressing themselves
into the surface of the world,

07:55.767 --> 07:58.316
but a footprint doesn't look like a boot.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.739
So, what have we got?
Any sign of that power loss?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.068
No problems. Must have been a glitch.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.907
Rajesh, you got anything?

08:06.987 --> 08:10.332
It's so busy down here,
I'm on Sudoku book 509.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.751
Well, we just had a great Ghost Shift.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.419
I kn ow.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.371
But we had nothing.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.004
Did they tell you?

08:20.083 --> 08:23.053
R&D came up with a new
spectrometer yesterday.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.381
Barged in here all full of themselves.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.594
Said they could detect the heat
off a single protozoa

08:30.760 --> 08:33.183
through half a mile of steel.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.812
And what did they find?

08:35.890 --> 08:39.235
Nothing. It gave them nothing.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.613
Same as ever.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.112
The machines keep saying
the Sphere can't exist.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.288
But there it is.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.115
Anything we can do?

08:52.198 --> 08:53.950
No, I'm all right.

08:54.034 --> 09:00.258
It's just... Gets into your head, this thing.
Like it's staring at you.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.380
<i>A ll right, we 'l! catch up la fer.
Thanks, Raj.</i>

09:03.460 --> 09:04.677
Yeah.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.003
Matt, get on to hospitality, will you?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.460
Send Rajesh something.
He's going mad down there.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.135
Not alcohol.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.043
We've kept it stable at 56.1.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.338
So, if you just check the statistics...

10:23.998 --> 10:26.797
Yvonne, I'm gonna double-check the stacks.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.924
- Just in case.
- Sure.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.843
Yvonne, I'm gonna cross-reference
the levels with the Sphere.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.223
Okay, fine.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.310
And they think we haven't noticed.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.857
Come on, we'll be all right down here.
Just two minutes.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.313
This is out of bounds.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.320
Yeah, and that's the point.
It's completely safe.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.151
They're just building new offices.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.861
What about the workmen?

10:52.944 --> 10:56.824
- They must be allocated somewhere else.
- It's not worth it for a snog.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.078
It is.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.918
Come on.

11:11.588 --> 11:12.885
Gareth?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.677
Now don't be daft. Where've you gone?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.270
Gareth!

11:20.597 --> 11:23.897
Look, I'm gonna head back.
I'm seeing you tonight, anyway.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.770
Gareth?

11:29.439 --> 11:31.191
I'm gonna go back to work.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.997
This is it.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.625
I'm going.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.163
See you.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.264
Now stop it, Gareth! I'm
not kidding, just stop it!

12:03.765 --> 12:06.484
Sorry, I'm just looking for my friend.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.066
Did anyone come down here?

12:16.277 --> 12:19.952
According to the paper,
they've elected a ghost as MP for Leeds.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.414
Now don't tell me you're gonna sit back
and do nothing.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.588
- "Who you gonna call?"
- Ghostbusters!

12:26.663 --> 12:28.586
"I ain't afraid of no ghosts!"

12:35.380 --> 12:36.848
When's the next shift?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.267
Quarter to. But don't go causing trouble.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.514
What's that lot do?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.436
Triangulates their point of origin.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.435
I don't suppose it's the Gelth?

12:44.514 --> 12:47.358
Nah. They were just coming
through one little rift.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.354
This lot are transposing themselves
over the whole planet.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.859
- Like tracing paper.
- You're always doing this.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.692
Reducing it to science.
Why can't it be real?

12:56.025 --> 12:57.698
But just think of it, though.

12:57.902 --> 13:01.532
All the people we've lost,
our families coming back home.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.876
- Don't you think it's beautiful?
- I think it's horrific.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.167
Rose, give us a hand!

13:16.796 --> 13:20.016
Soon as the cones activate, if that line
goes into the red, press that button there.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.638
If it doesn't stop,

13:21.718 --> 13:24.892
setting 15B, hold it against the port,
eight seconds and stop.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.390
Fifteen B, eight seconds.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.440
If it goes into the blue,
activate the deep scan on the left.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.277
Hang on a minute, I know. It's that one?

13:31.352 --> 13:32.478
Close.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.439
- That one?
- No, you've just killed us.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.909
Er... That one?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.612
Yeah! Now, what have we
got, two minutes to go?

13:41.070 --> 13:44.449
Two minutes till the next shift,
let's make it a good one, people.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.455
- Come on, you two.
- I'm sorry we're late.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.878
- Save it till later.
- Sorry we're late.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.626
And powering up!

14:17.774 --> 14:19.117
What's the line doing?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.198
It's all right, it's holding!

14:22.236 --> 14:24.409
You even look like him.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.911
How do you mean?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.667
I suppose I do, yeah.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.040
- You've changed so much.
- For the better.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.467
- I suppose.
- Mum, I used to work in a shop.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.461
I've worked in shops.
What's wrong with that?

14:38.544 --> 14:41.423
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I know what you meant.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.183
What happens when I'm gone?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.723
- Don't talk like that.
- No, but really.

14:46.803 --> 14:50.728
When I'm dead and buried, you won't have
any reason to come back home.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.310
- What happens then?
- I don't know.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.979
Do you think you'll ever settle down?

14:56.979 --> 15:00.734
The Doctor never will, so I can't.
I'll just keep on travelling.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.115
And you'll keep on changing.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.699
And in 40 years' time, 50,
there'll be this woman, this strange woman,

15:07.782 --> 15:12.333
walking through the marketplace
on some planet a billion miles from Earth.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.337
But she's not Rose Tyler,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.259
not any more.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.837
She's not even human.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.464
Here we go!

15:24.006 --> 15:27.101
Scanner's working! It
says, "Delta one six"!

15:29.011 --> 15:31.480
Come on, then. You beauty!

15:34.809 --> 15:37.653
And we're into Ghost Shift.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.730
Online.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.193
What have we got?

16:21.272 --> 16:23.274
Something's interfering
with the Ghost Field.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.494
- Location?
- It's close. It's within the city.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.366
Look at that! Don't like that much, do you?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.752
Who are you? Where are you coming from?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.704
Whoa! That's more like it!

16:36.954 --> 16:38.922
Not so friendly now, are you?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.501
Close it down! Close it down!

16:41.918 --> 16:43.920
Offline.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.893
It was a very specific
excitation of the Ghost Field,

16:57.975 --> 17:00.103
but that makes it easy to pinpoint.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.652
Almost there. South London.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.943
South East 15.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.787
It's a council estate, the Powell Estate.

17:11.071 --> 17:14.792
SE157G0. It was a public area.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.497
- Can we patch into the CCTV network?
- Doing it now.

17:23.334 --> 17:27.305
Here we go. We've got a
camera within 50 yards.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.351
- Oh my God.
- Is it him?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.933
It's him.

17:36.180 --> 17:40.026
I said so. Those ghosts are being forced
into existence from one specific point,

17:40.142 --> 17:41.439
and I can track down the source.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.896
<i>A (Ions-y!</i>

17:53.614 --> 17:54.991
He's coming.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.841
Rajesh, it's him!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.266
Now we've got you.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.728
I like that, allons-y.
I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y!

18:15.928 --> 18:17.771
Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!

18:17.847 --> 18:21.021
And then, it would be really brilliant
if I met someone called Alonso.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.855
'Cause then I could say, "Allons-y,
Alonso", every time. You're staring at me.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.277
My mum's still on board.

18:29.025 --> 18:32.154
If we end up on Mars, I'm gonna kill you.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.502
Coming up! Let's do it!

18:41.996 --> 18:43.248
Positions!

18:44.832 --> 18:45.879
Covered, sir!

18:46.083 --> 18:48.677
Ooh, well, there goes the
advantage of surprise.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.800
Still, cuts to the chase.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.678
Stay in here, look after Jackie.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.681
- I'm not looking after my mum.
- Well, you brought her.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.387
I was kidnapped.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.473
Doctor, they've got guns.

19:00.556 --> 19:04.231
And I haven't. Which makes me
the better person, don't you think?

19:04.518 --> 19:07.567
They can shoot me dead,
but the moral high ground is mine.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.900
Hold it! Steady, lads, steady!

19:18.324 --> 19:19.496
Oh!

19:20.451 --> 19:22.453
Oh, how marvellous!

19:23.913 --> 19:25.290
Oh, very good.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.546
Superb. Happy day.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.511
Urn, thanks. Nice to meet you.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.265
- I'm the Doctor.
- Oh, I should say. Hooray!

19:42.807 --> 19:45.686
- You've heard of me, then?
- Well, of course we have.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.272
And I have to say, if it wasn't for you,
none of us would be here.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.483
The Doctor and the Tardis!

20:00.074 --> 20:03.328
- And... And... And you are?
- Oh, plenty of time for that.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.210
But according to the records,
you're not one for travelling alone.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.918
The Doctor and his companion.
That's the pattern, isn't it, right?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.300
There's no point hiding anything.
Not from us.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.182
So, where is she?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.175
Yes! Sorry, good point.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.927
She's just a bit shy, that's all.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.604
But here she is, Rose Tyler!

20:23.931 --> 20:27.026
Hmm, she's not the best I've ever had.
Bit too blonde.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.820
Not too steady on her pins. Lot of that.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.115
And just last week, she stared
into the heart of the time vortex

20:33.190 --> 20:35.192
and aged 57 years, but she'll do.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.994
- I'm 40!
- Deluded.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.373
Bless. I'll have to trade her in.
Do you need anyone?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.914
She's very good at tea.
Well, I say very good. I mean not bad.

20:43.993 --> 20:48.294
Well, I say not bad. Anyway, lead on!
Allons-y!

20:48.372 --> 20:50.545
But not too fast. Her ankle's going.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.509
I'll show you where my ankle's going.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.431
It was only a matter of
time until you found us.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.387
And at last you've made it.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.934
I'd like to welcome you, Doctor.
Welcome to Torchwood.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.366
That's a Jathaa Sun Glider.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.826
Came down to Earth off
the Shetland Islands 10 years ago.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.033
- What, did it crash?
- No, we shot it down.

21:23.157 --> 21:26.127
It violated our airspace,
then we stripped it bare.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.625
The weapon that destroyed the Sycorax
on Christmas Day?

21:28.704 --> 21:29.921
That was us.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.375
Now, if you'd like to come with me.

21:33.042 --> 21:37.172
The Torchwood Institute has a motto.
"If it's alien, it's ours."

21:37.546 --> 21:41.141
Anything that comes from the sky,
we strip it down and we use it,

21:41.217 --> 21:43.060
for the good of the British Empire.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.313
- For the good of the what?
- The British Empire.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.436
- There isn't a British Empire.
- Not yet.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.523
Ah, excuse me. Now, if you wouldn't mind.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.479
Do you recognise this, Doctor?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.815
- That's a particle gun.
- Good, isn't it?

21:55.898 --> 21:57.946
Took us eight years to get it to work.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.786
It's the 21st century, you
can't have particle guns.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.247
We must defend our border
against the alien.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.121
- Thank you, Sebastian, isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.372
Thank you, Sebastian.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.531
I think it's very important
to know everyone by name.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.831
Torchwood is a very modern organisation.

22:11.914 --> 22:14.292
People skills. That's what
it's all about these days.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.922
I'm a people person.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.264
- Have you got anyone called Alonso?
- I don't think so. Is that important?

22:20.589 --> 22:24.435
- I suppose not. What was your name?
- Yvonne, Yvonne Hartman.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.480
Ah, yes. Now, we're rather fond of these.

22:28.556 --> 22:32.777
The Magna-clamp, found in a spaceship,
buried at the base of Mount Snowdon.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.358
Attach this to an object
and it cancels the mass.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.611
I could use it to lift two tons of weight
with a single hand.

22:38.732 --> 22:42.407
That's an imperial ton, by the way.
Torchwood refuses to go metric.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.955
I could do with that to carry the shopping.

22:45.030 --> 22:49.035
All these devices are for Torchwood's
benefit, not the general public's.

22:50.953 --> 22:52.796
So what about these ghosts?

22:54.665 --> 22:56.542
Ah, yes, the ghosts.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.879
- They're what you might call
a side effect. - of what?

22:59.962 --> 23:02.966
All in good time, Doctor.
There is an itinerary, trust me.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.009
Oi, where are you taking that?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.639
If it's alien, it's ours.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.689
- You'll never get inside it.
- Etcetera.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.585
Psychic paper, psychic pa per...

24:09.949 --> 24:12.327
All those times I've been on Earth,
I've never heard of you.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.707
Well, of course not. You're the enemy.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.166
You're actually named in the
Torchwood Foundation Charter of 1879

24:18.248 --> 24:19.670
as an enemy of the Crown.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.549
1879? That was called Torchwood,
that house in Scotland.

24:22.628 --> 24:25.632
That's right. Where you encountered
Queen Victoria and the werewolf.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.432
I think he makes half of it up.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.681
Her Majesty created the Torchwood Institute

24:29.760 --> 24:34.641
with the express intention of keeping
Britain great and fighting the alien horde.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.817
But if I'm the enemy,
does that mean I'm a prisoner?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.109
Oh, yes.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.821
But we'll make you perfectly comfortable.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.570
And there is so much you can teach us.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.985
Starting with this.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.128
Now, what do you make of that?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.211
You must be the Doctor.

25:03.293 --> 25:06.638
- Rajesh Singh. It's an honour, sir.
- Yeah.

25:07.965 --> 25:10.844
- What is that thing?
- We got no idea.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.974
What's wrong with it?

25:13.053 --> 25:15.431
What makes you think
there's something wrong with it?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.983
I don't know. It just feels weird.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.315
The Sphere has that effect on everyone.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.440
Makes you want to run and hide.
Like it's forbidden.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.901
We've tried analysing it,
using every device imaginable.

25:26.984 --> 25:30.363
But according to our instruments,
the Sphere doesn't exist.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.412
It weighs nothing. It doesn't age.

25:33.490 --> 25:37.836
No heat, no radiation
and has no atomic mass.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.546
I can see it.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.749
Fascinating, isn't it?

25:41.832 --> 25:44.881
It upsets people because
it gives off nothing.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.837
It is absent.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.090
Well, Doctor?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.467
This is a Void ship.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.138
And what is that?

25:56.263 --> 25:58.516
Well, it's impossible, for starters.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.811
I always thought it was
just a theory, but...

26:01.894 --> 26:05.319
It's a vessel
designed to exist outside time and space.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.317
Travelling through the Void.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.947
And what's "the Void"?

26:13.030 --> 26:15.658
The space between dimensions.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.377
There's all sorts of realities around us,
different dimensions,

26:18.494 --> 26:21.094
billions of parallel universes,
all stacked up against each other.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.837
The Void is the space in-between,

26:23.916 --> 26:25.918
containing absolutely nothing.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.511
Can you imagine that? Nothing.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.012
No light, no dark, no up, no down.
No life. No time.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.681
Without end.

26:36.303 --> 26:40.024
My people called it the Void,
the Eternals called it the Howling,

26:40.724 --> 26:42.818
but some people call it hell.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.152
But someone built the Sphere. What for?

26:47.356 --> 26:51.202
- Why go there?
- To explore. To escape.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.281
You could sit inside that thing
and eternity would pass you by.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.911
Big Bang,

26:56.990 --> 27:00.540
end of the universe, start of the next,
wouldn't even touch the sides.

27:00.661 --> 27:03.130
You'd exist outside the whole of creation.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.300
You see, we were right.
There is something inside it.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.759
Oh, yes.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.013
- So how do we get in there?
- We don't!

27:11.088 --> 27:14.058
We send that thing back into hell!
How did it get here in the first place?

27:14.133 --> 27:17.182
Well, that's how it all started.
The Sphere came through into this world,

27:17.261 --> 27:20.310
- and the ghosts followed in its wake.
- Show me.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.229
No, Doctor!

27:32.484 --> 27:35.408
I don't get it. What is it?
What am I supposed to be looking for?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.156
Just go to the left.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.919
Yvonne's gonna be back any minute.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.541
Just go to the left.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.589
What, you mean in here?

29:08.163 --> 29:10.006
The Sphere came through here.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.709
A hole in the world.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.337
Not active at the moment.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.591
But when we fire particle engines
at that exact spot, the breach opens up.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.347
How did you even find it?

29:20.467 --> 29:24.438
We were getting warning signs for years,
a radar black spot.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.141
So we built this place, Torchwood Tower.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.819
The breach was 600 feet above sea level.
It was the only way to reach it.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.522
You built a skyscraper
just to reach a spatial disturbance?

29:33.605 --> 29:36.154
- How much money have you got?
- Enough.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.162
Hold on a minute. We're in Canary Wharf.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.994
Must be. This building, it's Canary Wharf.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.377
Well, that is the public name for it.
But to those in the know, it's Torchwood.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.924
So, you find the breach, probe it,
the Sphere comes through

29:53.041 --> 29:54.793
600 feet above London, bam!

29:55.127 --> 29:57.721
It leaves a hole in the fabric of reality.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.050
And that hole, you think,
"Oh, shall we leave it alone?

30:01.174 --> 30:05.145
"Shall we back off? Should we play it safe?" Nah!
You think, "Let's make it bigger!"

30:05.220 --> 30:07.143
It's a massive source of energy.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.897
If we can harness that power, we need
never depend on the Middle East again.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.362
Britain will become truly independent.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.859
You can see for yourself,
the next Ghost Shift's in two minutes.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.069
- Cancel it.
- I don't think so.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.702
- I'm warning you. Cancel it!
- Oh, exactly as the legends would have it.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.580
The Doctor, lording it over us. Assuming
alien authority over the rights of man.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.078
Let me show you.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.625
Sphere comes through.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.970
But when it made the hole,
it cracked the world around it.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.265
The entire surface of this
dimension, splintered.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.184
And that's how the ghosts get through,
that's how they get everywhere.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.387
They're bleeding through the fault lines.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.644
Walking from their world, across the Void
and into yours.

30:49.723 --> 30:52.772
With the human race hoping and wishing
and helping them along.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.945
But too many ghosts and...

30:59.941 --> 31:02.535
Well, in that case, we'll
have to be more careful.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.784
Positions! Ghost Shift in one minute.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.957
Miss Hartman, I am asking
you, please don't do it.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.081
- We have done this a thousand times.
- Then stop at a thousand!

31:10.160 --> 31:11.912
We're in control of the ghosts.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.625
The levers can open the breach,
but equally they can close it.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.794
Okay.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.342
Sorry?

31:21.463 --> 31:23.215
Never mind. As you were.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.891
What, is that it?

31:24.966 --> 31:27.515
No, fair enough. I've said my bit.
Don't mind me.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.183
Any chance of a cup of tea?

31:29.304 --> 31:32.683
- Ghost Shift in 20 seconds.
- Mmm, can't wait to see it!

31:32.808 --> 31:34.230
You can't stop us, Doctor.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.734
No, absolutely not. Pull up a chair, Rose.
Come and watch the fireworks.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.982
Ghost Shift in 10 seconds.

31:40.982 --> 31:44.156
Nine, eight, seven,

31:44.277 --> 31:47.531
six, five, four,

31:48.031 --> 31:49.954
three, two...

31:50.450 --> 31:52.794
Stop the shift! I said, stop!

31:54.913 --> 31:55.960
Thank you.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.213
I suppose it makes sense
to get as much intelligence as possible.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.679
But the programme will recommence
as soon as you've explained everything.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.597
I'm glad to be of help.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.926
And someone clear up this glass.

32:07.008 --> 32:10.512
They did warn me, Doctor.
They said you liked to make a mess.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.947
Can I help you?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.161
I was just...

33:56.076 --> 33:58.625
Try not to look. It does that to everyone.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.710
- What do you want?
- Sorry, um...

34:01.790 --> 34:05.260
They sent me from personnel.
They said some man had been taken prisoner.

34:05.335 --> 34:06.678
Some sort of doctor?

34:06.753 --> 34:08.847
I'm just checking the
lines of communication.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.681
Did they tell you anything?

34:10.757 --> 34:12.759
Can I see your authorisation?

34:13.301 --> 34:14.518
Sure.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.231
Well, that's lucky.

34:19.306 --> 34:23.652
You see, everyone at Torchwood has
at least a basic level of psychic training.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.610
This paper is blank. And you're a fake.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.400
Seal the room. Call security.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.414
Samuel, can you check the door locks?
She just walked right in.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.706
Doing it now, sir.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.547
Well, if you'd like to take a seat.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.967
So these ghosts, whatever they are,
did they build the Sphere?

34:50.547 --> 34:53.847
Must have. Aimed it at this
dimension like a cannonball.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.604
Yvonne, I think you should see this.
We've got a visitor.

34:57.679 --> 35:02.526
Don't know who she I; but funnily enough,
she arrived at the same time as the Doctor.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.692
She one of yours?

35:07.022 --> 35:10.868
- Never seen her before in my life.
- Good, then we can have her shot.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.367
Oh, all right, then, it was worth a try.
That's...

35:14.613 --> 35:16.581
That's Rose Tyler.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.042
Sorry. Hello.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.037
Well, if that's Rose Tyler, who's she?

35:22.162 --> 35:23.709
I'm her mother.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.712
- Oh, you travel with her mother?
- He kidnapped me.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.719
Please, when Torchwood comes to write
my complete history,

35:29.794 --> 35:32.673
don't tell people I travelled
through time and space with her mother.

35:32.756 --> 35:33.928
Charming.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.926
I've got a reputation to uphold.

35:36.051 --> 35:40.056
Excuse me, everyone.
I thought I said stop the Ghost Shift.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.311
Who started the programme?

35:42.390 --> 35:45.234
I ordered you to stop. Who's doing that?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.813
Right, step away from
your monitors, everyone!

35:47.896 --> 35:51.321
Gareth! Adi! Stop what
you're doing, right now!

35:52.233 --> 35:55.487
Matt! Step away from your desk!
That's an order!

35:55.570 --> 35:58.699
Stop the levers! Andrew! Stop the levers!

35:58.782 --> 36:02.002
- What's she doing?
- Adi, step away from the desk.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.211
Listen to me, step away from the desk!

36:04.287 --> 36:05.755
She can't hear you.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.629
They're overriding the system.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.425
We're going into Ghost Shift.

36:16.257 --> 36:19.682
Yvonne, I thought you said
the next Ghost Shift was cancelled?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.605
What's going on? Yvonne?

36:25.558 --> 36:26.650
It can't be.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.282
It's active!

36:36.361 --> 36:38.204
It's the earpiece controlling them.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.952
I've seen this before.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.667
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.133
- What happened? What did you just do?
- They're dead.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.334
You killed them?

36:51.418 --> 36:53.170
Oh, someone else did that
long before I got here.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.513
- But you killed them!
- Jackie, I haven't got time for this!

36:55.630 --> 36:56.882
- What are those earpieces?
- Don't.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.514
But they're standard comms devices.
How does it control them?

36:59.592 --> 37:02.141
- Trust me, leave them alone.
- But what are they?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.474
Oh God!

37:05.807 --> 37:07.559
It goes inside their brain!

37:07.726 --> 37:11.902
- What about the Ghost Shift?
- 90% and still running.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.654
- Can't you stop it?
- They' re still controlling it.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.610
- They've hijacked the system.
- Who's "they"?

37:16.693 --> 37:20.368
Might be a remote transmitter but it's
got to be close by. I can trace it.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.699
Jackie, stay here!

37:21.823 --> 37:24.702
Keep those levers down!
Keep them offline!

37:25.702 --> 37:27.454
We've got a problem down here.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.255
Yvonne, can you hear me?

37:29.831 --> 37:32.675
Yvonne, for God's sake,
the Sphere is active!

37:32.959 --> 37:34.836
The readings are going wild!

37:34.961 --> 37:39.182
It's got weight, it's got mass,
an electromagnetic field. It exists!

37:41.885 --> 37:45.640
The door's sealed! Automatic quarantine!
We... We can't get out!

37:48.099 --> 37:50.899
It's all right, babe. We've beaten
them before, we can beat them again.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.363
That why I'm here. The fight goes on.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.239
The fight against what?

37:55.315 --> 37:56.783
What do you think?

38:06.534 --> 38:08.707
You two! You come with us, yeah.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.879
This way.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.056
- What's down here?
- What? I don't know.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.638
I think it's building work.
It's just renovations.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.894
- You should go back.
- Think again.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.115
What is it? What's down here?

38:45.198 --> 38:48.873
Earpieces, ear pods...
This world is colliding with another.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.920
And I think I know which one.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.508
What are they?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.336
They came through first.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.257
The advance guard.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.266
Cybermen.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.697
We had them beaten, but then they escaped.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.649
The Cybermen just vanished.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.786
They found their way through to this world,
but so did we.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.580
The Doctor said that was impossible.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.456
Yeah, it's not the first
time he's been wrong.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.288
What's inside that Sphere?

39:30.618 --> 39:34.293
No one knows. Cyber leader, Cyber King,
Emperor of the Cybermen.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.966
Whatever it is, he's dead meat.

39:38.126 --> 39:41.300
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah. It's good to see you, too.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.469
Get away from the machines!
Do what they say! Don't fight them!

39:47.969 --> 39:49.471
Don't shoot!

39:52.307 --> 39:53.604
What are they?

39:54.183 --> 39:56.151
<i>We are the Cybermen.</i>

39:57.812 --> 40:01.737
The Ghost Shift will be increased to 700%.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.781
Online.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.492
Here come the ghosts.

40:22.170 --> 40:25.765
It's extraordinary! There are more ghosts
than we've ever seen before,

40:25.840 --> 40:28.468
and it's happening all over the world.

40:28.551 --> 40:32.476
As far as we know,
the increase in ghost activity is harmless.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.942
Can anyone hear me?

40:44.859 --> 40:47.362
Come on, I need help down here! I need...

40:55.161 --> 40:56.458
Here we go.

41:05.838 --> 41:09.058
But these Cybermen,
what have they got to do with the ghosts?

41:09.175 --> 41:12.224
Don't you ever listen?
"A footprint doesn't look like a boot."

41:12.303 --> 41:14.647
Achieving full transfer.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.562
They're Cybermen.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.862
All of the ghosts are Cybermen.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.405
Millions of them.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.241
Right across the world.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.677
They're not ghosts. They're metal men!

41:53.469 --> 41:55.597
I urge you, stay in your homes!

42:16.826 --> 42:18.999
They're invading the whole planet.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.127
It's not an invasion.
It's too late for that.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.921
It's a victory.

42:26.085 --> 42:29.589
Sphere activated. Sphere activated.

42:30.465 --> 42:34.140
Sphere activated. Sphere activated

42:39.766 --> 42:43.987
I know what's in there, and I'm ready for them.
I've got just the thing.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.660
This is gonna blast them to hell.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.659
Samuel, what are you doing?

42:53.738 --> 42:55.991
The name's Mickey. Mickey Smith.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.456
Defending the Earth.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.491
I don't understand. The Cybermen don't have
the technology to build a Void ship.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.344
That's way beyond you.
How did you create that Sphere?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.922
The Sphere is not ours.

43:11.464 --> 43:12.511
What?

43:12.590 --> 43:16.185
The Sphere broke down the barriers
between worlds.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.933
We only followed.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.640
Its origin is unknown.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.521
Then what's inside it?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.193
Rose is down there!

43:27.438 --> 43:29.031
That's not Cybermen.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.445
Oh my God!

43:33.528 --> 43:37.203
Location, Earth. Life farms detected.

43:37.281 --> 43:41.912
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

43:42.203 --> 43:44.171
Exterminate!

44:36.257 --> 44:37.975
This planet is starting to boil!

44:38.092 --> 44:40.470
Keep going and both worlds
will fall into the Void.

44:40.595 --> 44:42.814
Genesis Ark is primed.

44:42.930 --> 44:45.649
The Cybermen came through
from one world to another,

44:45.725 --> 44:46.851
and so did we.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.858
We must protect the Genesis Ark.

44:50.938 --> 44:54.283
This is our world, not yours.
And you're going to listen for once.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.027
You didn't need to kill him!

44:56.110 --> 44:58.909
Neither did we need him alive!

44:58.988 --> 45:00.956
You're in every street!
You're in their homes!

45:01.032 --> 45:02.249
You've got their children!

45:02.325 --> 45:04.293
Cybermen plus Daleks,

45:04.410 --> 45:07.254
together we could upgrade the Universe.
