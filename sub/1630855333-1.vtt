WEBVTT

01:18.879 --> 01:20.981
Marvel.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.941
It's a beast of a country

01:48.976 --> 01:50.778
and pigs for people.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.582
Relax.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.450
I see you as an outcast,

01:57.685 --> 01:58.886
like myself.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.524
Help me, and I will do
great things for you.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.262
What are you?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.730
An invisible man.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.301
And an invisible man
is a man of power,

02:14.502 --> 02:17.137
but if you betray
me or disobey me,

03:28.242 --> 03:29.076
Griffin!

03:30.978 --> 03:31.812
Griffin!

03:32.880 --> 03:34.682
I know you're in there.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.884
Griffin! You open this door now!

03:38.319 --> 03:39.987
Griffin!

03:39.987 --> 03:42.222
Where's my rent?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.997
I know you're in
there, I can hear you!

03:52.065 --> 03:52.900
Griffin!

03:54.935 --> 03:56.270
Griffin!

04:26.900 --> 04:28.669
What's going on?

06:07.568 --> 06:08.836
Look, Margaret,

06:08.836 --> 06:11.271
an invisible man plagues
the town of Iping.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.743
They claim to have a clergyman
and a doctor as witnesses.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.546
Supposedly, this invisible
man inflicted serious injuries

06:18.546 --> 06:20.380
on our Constable Jaffers.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.083
Clearly, the folk of
Iping have lost the ability

06:23.083 --> 06:24.918
to hear the words coming
out of their own mouths.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.919
What rot.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.522
Honestly, Miss Adeline,

06:28.522 --> 06:29.457
you have better
things to be spending

06:29.457 --> 06:31.191
both your time and money on.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.128
Lord knows this place could
use more of the latter.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.231
And not from pawning
your belongings.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.001
Begging your pardon.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.339
Oh, you think we haven't
noticed the steady disappearance

06:46.339 --> 06:48.809
of all of this household's
valuable works of art?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.779
Never thought I'd see the day.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.716
And letting poor Arthur go.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.851
The best footman you're
ever likely to see.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.224
You'll be selling the
master's chess set next.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.593
Not that, Margaret.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.396
Never that.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.540
He seems to be in
rather a hurry.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.775
Though he doesn't seem
to be getting very far.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.447
Aye, if his pockets
were full of lead,

07:27.447 --> 07:28.649
he couldn't run heavier.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.692
Oi, stranger,

08:45.893 --> 08:46.860
what can I get you?

08:48.061 --> 08:49.062
Your finest,

08:50.297 --> 08:51.298
food and drink.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.468
Get some chicken.

09:28.535 --> 09:29.402
Books?

09:36.076 --> 09:36.910
Yeah.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.279
Yeah, they're books.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.850
Just seems strange is all,

09:43.984 --> 09:46.453
seeing a man such as
yourself carrying books,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.422
and into a pub of all places.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.493
Some extraordinary
things in books.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.729
Indeed.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.101
You think
you can hide from me?

10:34.101 --> 10:35.435
Oi! What's going
on over there?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.474
He's gone mad, grab him!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.410
Steady, steady.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.211
Steady.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.998
Marvel!

13:56.636 --> 13:57.437
Adeline.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.274
Is that you?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.446
Help me, Adeline.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.148
It's me, Griffin.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.349
Griffin?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.185
Well, what in the
world? Show yourself!

14:23.130 --> 14:25.198
Steady
yourself, Adeline!

14:25.198 --> 14:26.366
For God's sake!

14:27.200 --> 14:28.635
I want help badly.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.702
I've been shot!

14:30.904 --> 14:34.307
I'm nauseous and ill.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.910
Just stop!

14:36.910 --> 14:38.078
Please, just help me!

14:45.518 --> 14:46.353
Griffin?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.722
How can this be?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.225
Are you a ghost?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.427
Ghost.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.596
Here I thought you were
a woman of science.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.100
You recall our
days at university?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.836
My experiments on
matter and light,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.338
on vision and visibility.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.075
The invisible man.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.878
Oh my God, you've done it.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.280
Look, Adeline,

15:13.280 --> 15:14.581
I'm starving and freezing.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.084
Have you got a dressing gown?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.885
You can find some
of Reginald's clothes

15:18.885 --> 15:20.487
in the wardrobe.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.622
Use one of his
shirts as a bandage.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.192
Where were you shot?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.329
The bullet
passed through my arm.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.684
I could use your help with this.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.567
Hold your arm up
where I need to wrap it.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.670
It's
right in front of you.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.468
I'd forgotten how
tender was your touch.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.404
How terribly it pained me.

16:51.978 --> 16:52.812
My blood, it,

16:54.314 --> 16:56.183
it turns visible
when it coagulates.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.220
Reginald,

17:00.220 --> 17:01.321
where is the old chap?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.056
He passed away.

17:03.056 --> 17:03.923
What?

17:04.924 --> 17:07.694
Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.196
Truly, I am.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.298
Look, you must
forgive me, Adeline.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.665
Coming here without
an invitation

17:12.665 --> 17:14.534
after so many years.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.768
I had nowhere else to go.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.905
You may stay in
here for tonight.

17:18.905 --> 17:19.972
And food?

17:21.308 --> 17:23.210
I'll fetch you something
from the kitchen.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.336
Oh, Griffin,

19:30.403 --> 19:32.004
what have you done?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.083
Morning, ma'am.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.485
Oh, please, let me
carry that for you.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.420
No, I'm perfectly capable

19:47.420 --> 19:49.622
of preparing my
own breakfast tray.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.057
Thank you.

19:51.057 --> 19:51.891
Mrs. Kemp,

19:53.025 --> 19:55.061
I couldn't enter your
room to clean it.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.696
I don't want it cleaned.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.599
In fact, just stay out of my
room until further notice.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.633
Yes, ma'am.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.568
Apologies, ma'am.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.590
Griffin?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.779
Are we alone?

20:48.147 --> 20:49.616
Yes, I sent the girl away.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.186
What happened to you, Griffin?

20:54.186 --> 20:55.288
How did you end up at my house

20:55.288 --> 20:56.889
in this condition and bleeding?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.891
I recalled you
and Reginald had settled

20:58.891 --> 21:00.693
in Port Burdock.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.161
I hoped for shelter,

21:02.161 --> 21:05.765
perhaps for Reginald to help
with aspects of my experiments.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.569
Even with his
childish understanding.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.703
Childish?

21:10.703 --> 21:11.938
He was a brilliant man!

21:11.938 --> 21:14.541
He was
closed-minded and small.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.675
Still,

21:15.675 --> 21:17.009
he may have had some use

21:17.009 --> 21:18.911
with the right instruction.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.347
Your jealousy was
always beneath you.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.981
Reginald was the best of us.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.923
Have you turned your
clothes invisible?

21:30.923 --> 21:32.124
No.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.226
My formula only works
on living matter.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.129
Then you're wearing nothing.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.834
I must ask you to
make yourself decent.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.704
Always so proper.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.007
Though, one summer
night, I seem to recall-

21:48.007 --> 21:49.208
Griffin, please.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.757
Ah, this is better.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.258
Warmer.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.195
I always admired
Reginald's taste in attire.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.330
He looked well in it.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.108
What do you think?

22:22.108 --> 22:24.711
Perhaps I could even
venture outside like this,

22:24.711 --> 22:27.013
if I kept people from
approaching too closely.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.384
My wound appears to
be healing quickly.

22:31.384 --> 22:32.685
Perhaps a side effect.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.954
I can see from the newspapers

22:34.954 --> 22:36.355
and from the gunfire last night

22:36.355 --> 22:37.824
that others are aware of you.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.761
How did you get shot?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.530
There was
a real fool of a man,

22:43.530 --> 22:46.298
a sort of confederate of mine,

22:46.298 --> 22:47.434
curse him,

22:47.434 --> 22:49.168
who stole my money.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.670
He created quite
a ruckus in a pub

22:50.670 --> 22:51.971
when I tried to catch him.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.406
Is he invisible too?

22:53.406 --> 22:54.641
No.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.643
I alone possess this power.

22:56.643 --> 22:57.910
Are you a danger to me

22:57.910 --> 22:59.479
and the good people
of this household?

22:59.479 --> 23:01.814
Peace, Adeline,

23:01.814 --> 23:02.882
and patience.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.685
I'll tell you my story,

23:05.685 --> 23:07.720
but first, I need rest.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.652
Good morning, Mrs. Kemp.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.293
Always a pleasure.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.928
Patrolling the neighborhood?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.597
You seem rather overstaffed.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.399
I wish it were a patrol.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.735
This is a manhunt.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.170
Oh dear.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.206
I've sent men with tracking
dogs to sweep the forest

24:00.206 --> 24:02.008
on both sides of the road,

24:02.008 --> 24:04.310
so if you hear their
racket, don't be alarmed.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.913
I heard a vagrant
caused a brawl last night

24:06.913 --> 24:08.481
at the Jolly Cricketers.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.382
You are pursuing him?

24:10.382 --> 24:14.020
News travels surprisingly
quick here in the outskirts.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.188
No said vagrant, quite
a twitchy fellow.

24:17.924 --> 24:19.325
Then whom are you hunting?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.393
Well,

24:21.393 --> 24:22.729
our friendly drifter claimed

24:22.729 --> 24:26.633
that an invisible
man tried to kill him

24:26.633 --> 24:28.635
and caused the
disturbance at the pub.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.604
He begged to be locked
in our most secure cell.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.339
Surely you
didn't indulge him.

24:33.339 --> 24:35.174
Oh, I had a good mind to.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.209
Poor PC Collins got
shot on his account.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.611
Oh, he'll be all right.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.682
That crazed man wasn't the
one who pulled the trigger.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.051
We're here because,
invisible man or not,

24:45.051 --> 24:47.086
we did find a trail
of blood in the street

24:47.086 --> 24:49.622
leading out of town towards
this general direction.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.659
Whoever he is,

24:52.659 --> 24:55.061
the man seems smart enough
to staunch his own bleeding

24:55.061 --> 24:56.929
and avoid the road.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.998
We lost his trail a
good distance back.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.336
Have you experienced any
suspicious occurrences

25:04.336 --> 25:05.171
since last night?

25:06.573 --> 25:07.774
Strange noises,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.109
broken window,

25:10.109 --> 25:11.443
missing any food or supplies?

25:11.443 --> 25:12.278
No.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.646
No.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.047
Nothing like that.

25:15.047 --> 25:15.882
Thank heaven.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.985
Keeping you safe
is my sacred duty.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.454
Please, continue to
take all precautions.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.257
What happened to the vagrant?

25:27.326 --> 25:30.296
I locked him up for the
night for instigating the brawl

25:30.296 --> 25:32.264
then released him
earlier this morning.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.968
You sent a mentally disturbed
man out into the street?

25:37.403 --> 25:39.205
I run the police
station, Mrs. Kemp,

25:39.205 --> 25:40.106
not an asylum.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.743
If you'd support me in
my letters to the mayor

25:43.743 --> 25:44.777
and to the city council,

25:44.777 --> 25:46.212
Port Burdock would build one.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.147
A more humane one.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.417
The people here
respect you enough.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.054
Supporting the view

25:55.054 --> 25:57.724
in your letters means
supporting new taxes,

25:59.225 --> 26:00.059
which I don't.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.898
I heard the vagrant was
carrying a large sum of money.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.534
What exactly is your
interest in this man?

26:08.534 --> 26:11.337
You know I work
with the unfortunate.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.239
Your interest seems
rather more specific.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.607
Can't
a lady indulge

26:14.607 --> 26:16.242
in some idle
neighborhood gossip?

26:19.045 --> 26:20.747
Perhaps I could
visit you again.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.349
We'll talk about this gossip.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.251
It seems here the
grapevine is more efficient

26:25.251 --> 26:26.653
than the telegram.

26:36.095 --> 26:36.929
Good day.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.701
Ma'am.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.535
How do you do, William?

26:43.535 --> 26:45.705
As always, thank you
for your service.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.875
Can you tell me, has anyone
died because of this drifter

26:48.875 --> 26:50.710
or anything at all
related to him?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.278
Not so far.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.279
Thank the good Lord.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.383
Look, Mrs. Kemp,

26:57.383 --> 26:58.685
we attend the same meetings,

26:58.685 --> 27:00.987
I support your politics.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.454
You like to help people in need,

27:02.454 --> 27:05.424
and I'm happy to feed you
information from time to time,

27:05.424 --> 27:07.326
but please,

27:07.326 --> 27:09.796
don't go looking
to help this one.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.230
I've not seen him before,

27:11.230 --> 27:13.065
and I know all the pikers
around these parts.

27:14.266 --> 27:15.968
Let the bloke move on, eh?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.405
He's bad news for Port Burdock.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.472
PC William?

28:28.841 --> 28:29.675
Griffin?

29:16.155 --> 29:18.490
Oh, forgive me, ma'am.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.226
Did I leave the door open?

29:20.226 --> 29:22.094
Are you all right
in here by yourself?

29:22.962 --> 29:24.430
Begging your pardon, ma'am,

29:24.430 --> 29:25.932
why wouldn't I be?

29:30.536 --> 29:32.271
If you don't mind, ma'am.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.272
Of course.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.089
Well, at least you have the
good sense not to openly move

29:50.089 --> 29:51.723
around the house
until nightfall.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.127
Where did you disappear
to all day long?

29:56.362 --> 29:57.964
If I
didn't know you better,

29:57.964 --> 30:00.532
I would suspect you of
having just made a joke.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.302
Did you wander into town,

30:03.302 --> 30:05.771
or were you inside
my house lurking?

30:05.771 --> 30:07.039
I was out,

30:07.039 --> 30:08.474
gathering useful knowledge.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.278
I saw you speaking
to the police.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.812
Learn anything interesting?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.047
I learnt that
you came off worse

30:15.047 --> 30:16.815
in the scuffle you instigated.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.519
You don't appear to have
caused any deliberate harm.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.122
You were always
rather a scoundrel,

30:23.122 --> 30:25.591
but I'm relieved to know
you're not irredeemable.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.462
You haven't changed since
our days at university.

30:30.462 --> 30:31.697
Once again, I find you rummaging

30:31.697 --> 30:33.632
through my private correspondence.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.602
Oh, your
precious propriety again.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.204
Had you more
respect for propriety

30:38.204 --> 30:39.805
and more regard for
the feelings of others,

30:39.805 --> 30:41.573
things might have
ended differently.

30:50.917 --> 30:51.717
No!

30:55.121 --> 30:55.922
Don't.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.358
Please.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.797
It was our last game together.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.870
I still somehow expect
him to make his next move.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.043
You were always a snoop,

31:17.043 --> 31:19.111
always disdainful of
others' boundaries.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.547
It seems you found a way

31:21.547 --> 31:23.549
to make that illicit
behavior nigh undetectable.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.953
I can do many
things while invisible, Adeline.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.955
Things that ordinary men cannot,

31:28.955 --> 31:32.158
things that Reginald
could never do.

31:32.158 --> 31:33.825
For example,

31:33.825 --> 31:36.062
I could save you.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.529
I could save your home.

31:39.031 --> 31:42.601
I thought your household
staff looked a bit sparse.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.004
A girl and an old woman.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.042
Take it.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.280
It's a gift.

32:01.787 --> 32:04.190
I thought you said all
your money had been taken.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.992
Come now, Adeline,

32:05.992 --> 32:07.759
who do you intend
to ask for help?

32:09.095 --> 32:11.430
You don't come from
a prosperous family.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.764
They can't shoulder the burden

32:12.764 --> 32:15.134
of your husband's
failed research.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.536
He said he was closer
to a breakthrough.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.271
It would have paid
for everything.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.007
Yes,

32:21.007 --> 32:24.343
I'm familiar with the sweet
siren song of futile hopes.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.679
But with my success,

32:27.679 --> 32:29.381
there's more where
that came from,

32:30.916 --> 32:33.385
if we can come to terms.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.423
You don't have
much time, my dear.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.292
The bank's letter's a week old.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.929
They are coming for you.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.145
Good day, Mrs. Kemp.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.813
Mr. Wicksteed, how are you?

33:34.813 --> 33:36.882
How's things with
the city council?

33:36.882 --> 33:39.818
Port Burdock is
developing remarkably well,

33:39.818 --> 33:41.353
I'm happy to say.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.190
In fact, I've just come from
a meeting with His Lordship.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.657
With a little bit of luck,

33:45.657 --> 33:48.160
our prosperous town may soon
be enjoying the benefits

33:48.160 --> 33:50.096
of a new electricity
power station,

33:50.096 --> 33:51.997
and before the turn
of the century.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.032
Oh, I'm so delighted to hear

33:54.032 --> 33:56.402
we're making such
heroic strides forward.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.871
Perhaps Port Burdock might
share some of it's prosperities

33:59.871 --> 34:02.674
with the less fortunate.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.076
My dear lady,

34:04.076 --> 34:06.112
I'm not unaware of your
gallant letter-writing campaign

34:06.112 --> 34:08.714
to men of influence
around the town,

34:08.714 --> 34:11.049
but I have to give
you a piece of advice.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.453
It's an old Chinese
proverb, I believe.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.822
Give a man a fish, you
feed him for a day.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.392
Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for life.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.197
Your intentions
were honorable but misguided.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.834
As long as I sit on the council,

34:28.834 --> 34:31.970
your charitable schemes will
never see the light of day.

34:33.205 --> 34:36.642
And if I may be so
bold, Mrs. Kemp,

34:36.642 --> 34:38.610
if I was in your situation,

34:38.610 --> 34:42.414
I'd concentrate on getting my
own financial house in order

34:42.414 --> 34:46.185
before I start telling other
people how to manage theirs.

35:03.802 --> 35:07.306
I am relieved we can avoid
the heartbreaking business

35:07.306 --> 35:10.576
of the bank throwing a
widow out onto the street.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.678
So I have more time?

35:14.079 --> 35:18.016
Uh, making this large payment
means I have the flexibility

35:18.016 --> 35:21.587
to grant you an extension
to repay the balance,

35:21.587 --> 35:24.323
but, um, not long, I'm afraid.

35:25.657 --> 35:26.492
30 days.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.634
Ah, the, uh,

35:36.535 --> 35:37.569
the colonel's arrived.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.404
Um...

35:39.738 --> 35:42.808
Um, a thief broke into
the bank last night

35:42.808 --> 35:44.676
and stole an enormous
sum of money.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.614
If you'll excuse
me, I have some, um,

35:48.614 --> 35:50.516
some unpleasant
business to attend to.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.686
Good morning.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.621
Morning, sir.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.256
Uh, please, come this way.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.690
Like you, Reginald
continued to study the strange

37:04.690 --> 37:07.092
and bizarre aspects of science.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.827
He hoped his research
would earn an admittance

37:08.827 --> 37:10.195
into the Royal Society.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.399
Nothing as impressive
as your discovery, but-

37:13.399 --> 37:14.866
This will do.

37:14.866 --> 37:18.103
Are you confident you can
find a cure for your condition?

37:18.103 --> 37:21.407
It was to be the
focus of my work in Iping.

37:21.407 --> 37:24.075
But I can do nothing without
my research journals.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.379
The fool who stole my
money took them too.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.549
Without them,
discovering an antidote

37:30.549 --> 37:31.983
involves
trial-and-error mixtures

37:31.983 --> 37:35.921
for over 300,000, maybe
400,000, chemical combinations.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.623
It would take my whole lifetime.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.092
You must tell me how you
achieved this, Griffin.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.694
It's a miracle of science.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.997
If only you had
cared this much about me

37:45.997 --> 37:47.466
during my time at university.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.974
I devoted every shilling I
possessed to my research.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.476
Why invisibility?

37:57.476 --> 37:59.210
Oh, dear Adeline,

37:59.210 --> 38:01.947
I wasn't researching
how to be unseen.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.682
I was researching
how to be free.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.354
My experiments met with
unparalleled success,

38:08.354 --> 38:09.988
but my landlord grew impatient,

38:09.988 --> 38:11.490
I know you're in there!

38:11.490 --> 38:13.291
and I had little
time to conclude my research.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.493
Griffin!

38:14.493 --> 38:16.294
When he came
to collect his rent,

38:16.294 --> 38:17.896
I had no choice.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.832
I put on an act that would
have made any magician proud.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.148
My head was already
teeming with plans

38:37.148 --> 38:39.284
of all the wild and
wonderful things

38:39.284 --> 38:41.387
I now had the freedom
to do with impunity.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.623
But my triumph was short-lived.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.927
I had been a naive fool.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.196
What helpless absurdity
an invisible man is

38:51.196 --> 38:52.598
in the cold climate

38:52.598 --> 38:54.299
and a dirty, crowded city.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.736
Every crossing was a danger,

38:57.736 --> 39:00.305
every pedestrian a
thing to watch alertly.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.275
I had no shelter, no covering
in the coming winter,

39:05.711 --> 39:08.947
and to get clothing was to
forego all my advantage.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.916
Snow was settling upon me,

39:10.916 --> 39:13.151
rain would make me
a watery outline,

39:13.151 --> 39:16.054
a glistening surface of a man.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.390
London fog would turn me
into a ghostly bubble,

39:18.390 --> 39:20.892
more visible than any
ordinary man blurred

39:20.892 --> 39:21.927
and obscured by it.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.839
I stumbled across a
humble costuming shop.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.542
That night after the
store owner had gone home,

39:36.542 --> 39:38.510
I rummaged out a costume

39:38.510 --> 39:41.312
and robbed him of any
available money I could find.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.151
Finally, I went
out into the world,

39:47.318 --> 39:50.088
a grotesque but still
credible figure.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.593
I realized invisibility
made it possible

39:54.593 --> 39:56.294
for me to gain wealth and power

39:57.896 --> 40:00.566
but also made it
impossible to enjoy them.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.706
I eventually made
my way to Iping.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.408
It was supposed to
be quiet and safe.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.778
I went there to find a
way of restoring myself.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.245
Then,

40:14.245 --> 40:17.082
I was betrayed by the one
man who was supposed to help.

40:18.383 --> 40:19.751
It's remarkable, Griffin.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.153
Remarkable.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.890
They'll have to rewrite
every textbook in the world.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.324
Think of the fortune
you might raise

40:26.324 --> 40:28.527
and the good you
might do with it.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.129
We must think
bigger than that, my dear.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.445
Colonel Adye.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.131
Such a relief

41:06.131 --> 41:08.033
you were able to delay
the bank's foreclosure.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.603
However did you pull
off such a miracle?

41:11.603 --> 41:15.140
My brother in America
sent me the necessary funds.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.842
He's doing quite
well for himself.

41:17.909 --> 41:18.744
Indeed.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.213
Railroads.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.414
Hmm.

41:23.414 --> 41:26.117
Some men have such a
good head for business.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.452
Others,

41:27.452 --> 41:29.454
like your late
husband, for science,

41:30.556 --> 41:32.958
but science hardly
ever pays the bill, eh?

41:32.958 --> 41:35.493
If only the good deeds
paid as well as the bad.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.896
They never do,

41:37.896 --> 41:38.964
do they, Mrs. Kemp?

41:44.002 --> 41:46.838
You brought your husband's
favorite coat out of retirement.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.013
It's been years

41:55.013 --> 41:57.415
since I last saw him walking
through town in this coat.

41:58.416 --> 41:59.885
I was reminiscing.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.435
It seems, perhaps, your
fortunes have changed.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.606
Strange how the world
always gets on just fine,

42:20.606 --> 42:21.439
don't you think?

42:22.641 --> 42:25.110
No matter what tragedies
befall us mere mortals.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.016
The bank's available
cash is stolen.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.751
Fortunately for them,

42:32.751 --> 42:34.686
you were able to pay
them a sizeable fraction

42:34.686 --> 42:36.021
of what you owe,

42:36.021 --> 42:37.488
in cash.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.858
Why exactly are
you here, Colonel?

42:39.858 --> 42:40.692
Did you know

42:42.127 --> 42:44.262
the bank was robbed of twice
the amount you paid them?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.033
I wonder where that
money disappeared to.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.068
Well, perhaps that mysterious
drifter might have answers

42:50.068 --> 42:50.869
for you.

42:52.503 --> 42:53.304
I agree.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.307
That's why I'm
tracking his movements.

42:56.307 --> 43:00.211
Perhaps he can lead my police
to the bank's stolen money.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.248
But apparently,

43:05.784 --> 43:08.319
I'm not the only one
interested in him.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.295
You appear to be
messengering letters

43:17.295 --> 43:20.098
to poor houses all
over the region

43:20.098 --> 43:21.332
in search of the vagrant,

43:22.333 --> 43:23.501
Mr. Thomas Marvel.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.304
How did you come by
his name, Adeline?

43:26.304 --> 43:28.306
How did you get these?

43:28.306 --> 43:30.642
I always alert authorities
around the regions

43:30.642 --> 43:33.111
about persons of interest.

43:33.979 --> 43:36.147
They forwarded me the letters.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.650
They appear little
like your handwriting.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.086
They're mine.

43:41.086 --> 43:42.020
And Mr. Marvel?

43:43.221 --> 43:44.756
Colonel Adye, I
must ask you to leave.

43:45.857 --> 43:46.825
Immediately.

43:57.368 --> 43:59.671
I came as a courtesy to
give you the opportunity

43:59.671 --> 44:00.672
to be frank with me.

44:01.807 --> 44:03.775
I do suspect you're
withholding information.

44:12.017 --> 44:13.685
Please believe me,

44:13.685 --> 44:16.321
these kinds of secrets
never get better with time.

44:36.374 --> 44:38.209
How dare you write
letters in my name,

44:38.209 --> 44:40.578
and how dare you
threaten Colonel Adye!

45:13.912 --> 45:14.980
Thomas Marvel.

45:36.902 --> 45:37.803
Mrs. Kemp.

45:41.539 --> 45:44.242
If Dr. Kemp could see you,
he'd be sick with worry.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.080
I'll be going home now, ma'am.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.822
This letter came in the
afternoon post for you.

45:58.123 --> 45:59.357
It seems urgent, ma'am.

46:23.348 --> 46:25.383
"Dear Mrs. Kemp,

46:25.383 --> 46:27.685
I've received your
letter requesting my aid

46:27.685 --> 46:31.789
to help you locate
an unfortunate man named Thomas Marvel.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.694
Alas, I feel obliged
to inform you

46:36.694 --> 46:39.364
that the local police have
made the same request.

46:40.565 --> 46:43.734
They keep the miserable
man under surveillance.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.736
For what reason,
I cannot divine.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.175
Sadly, I must report to them
the arrival of your letter,

46:52.343 --> 46:55.013
but in honor of our
past works together

46:55.013 --> 46:57.215
helping the laboring classes,

46:57.215 --> 47:00.251
I can report to you that Thomas
Marvel is sheltering here

47:00.251 --> 47:02.353
in our annex.

47:02.353 --> 47:05.356
Your true friend
and devoted servant,

47:05.356 --> 47:08.126
Bishop Oliver White,
East Cliff Abbey."

47:12.830 --> 47:13.798
Mrs. Kemp.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.003
You are too sensible to
venture to this part of town

47:18.003 --> 47:19.737
so close to nightfall.

47:19.737 --> 47:21.306
I must find that man.

47:21.306 --> 47:24.109
You place me in a
difficult position,

47:24.109 --> 47:27.278
especially if you are involved
with anything dishonest.

47:27.278 --> 47:28.379
I do not want to know

47:28.379 --> 47:29.614
about anything that-

47:29.614 --> 47:31.249
Have you informed
Colonel Adye yet?

47:32.617 --> 47:33.885
You know I must.

47:35.053 --> 47:37.355
Port Burdock is
not a large city.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.990
Sooner rather than later,

47:38.990 --> 47:42.327
word will get back to the
police about his presence,

47:42.327 --> 47:45.563
including word about
your inquiries here.

47:49.968 --> 47:53.271
This is the one and only time
I can help you in this manner.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.374
He avoids the other homeless,

47:56.374 --> 47:57.408
find him in the pews.

48:10.788 --> 48:13.258
We have a
mutual acquaintance.

48:18.263 --> 48:19.197
I don't know you.

48:20.932 --> 48:23.534
And I doubt we'd be moving
in the same society.

48:25.736 --> 48:26.571
I'm here alone.

48:32.010 --> 48:35.146
I'm curious to learn why you
think I need that assurance.

48:36.781 --> 48:39.517
For a man of means, you
choose poor accommodations.

48:43.989 --> 48:46.891
A man who spends his money
is one to draw attention.

48:48.726 --> 48:50.595
I ain't making
that mistake again.

48:52.297 --> 48:54.699
You being here is case in point.

48:58.003 --> 48:59.971
If you're his friend,
what do you want?

49:01.472 --> 49:03.108
The truth is, I am his friend.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.444
I just don't know
whether he is mine.

49:10.115 --> 49:11.616
He's a sick man.

49:13.484 --> 49:14.952
Always yammering on

49:14.952 --> 49:18.356
about his plans to bring
the entire country to heel.

49:18.356 --> 49:19.557
The entire country?

49:20.458 --> 49:21.292
Yeah.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.929
But Thomas Marvel showed him.

49:27.332 --> 49:29.367
Queen Victoria should
give me a medal.

49:32.370 --> 49:35.140
I took the wind right
out of his sails, I did.

49:39.077 --> 49:40.611
Could you see
your way to parting

49:40.611 --> 49:42.213
with that journal in your hands?

49:47.518 --> 49:48.486
I knew it.

49:50.455 --> 49:53.658
You just want the power
for yourself, don't you?

49:53.658 --> 49:54.892
Well, it's mine!

49:54.892 --> 49:57.195
You're in league with
the invisible man!

50:00.131 --> 50:02.567
She's in league with
the invisible man!

50:04.202 --> 50:05.703
He's with her now.

50:09.574 --> 50:10.841
Marvel, wait!

50:28.926 --> 50:29.760
Griffin?

52:19.637 --> 52:20.771
Griffin.

52:22.407 --> 52:23.408
Where have you been?

52:25.142 --> 52:27.011
Why did you follow
Colonel Adye into town?

52:27.011 --> 52:28.479
What did you do to him?

52:28.479 --> 52:31.516
Do you actually
care for that insufferable man?

52:33.651 --> 52:36.254
I wanted to see what he
actually knew about us.

52:37.288 --> 52:38.756
No doubt my
confederate had talked

52:38.756 --> 52:40.157
the police chief's ears off

52:40.157 --> 52:42.960
with wild tales of
the invisible man.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.429
I wanted to know

52:44.429 --> 52:45.996
if good, old Colonel Adye
believed the stories.

52:46.931 --> 52:48.165
And?

52:48.165 --> 52:49.767
Well, of
course he doesn't.

52:52.237 --> 52:53.571
Sit down.

52:58.976 --> 53:02.213
Life must go on, my girl.

53:04.482 --> 53:06.384
There is so much for us to do.

53:08.753 --> 53:11.589
Reginald would've never
made so bold a move.

53:11.589 --> 53:13.224
That
was him all over.

53:14.158 --> 53:16.627
And yet, he won what mattered.

53:18.929 --> 53:21.666
Imagine what we could
do together, Adeline.

53:21.666 --> 53:23.834
I know you wish to
do great things.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.437
I can ferret out the hidden
information you need,

53:27.605 --> 53:29.507
secure the funds
that you require.

53:31.509 --> 53:34.345
I can remove the obstacles
that stand in your way.

53:36.481 --> 53:38.649
From this day forward,

53:38.649 --> 53:41.519
life will be so much easier
for you, Adeline Kemp.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.623
But I must have my journals.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.226
Only when I master invisibility
will the world bend

53:49.226 --> 53:50.461
to my will.

53:50.461 --> 53:53.364
Only then can you make
it a better place.

53:54.932 --> 53:56.233
I must have my journals,

53:56.233 --> 53:57.201
Adeline,

53:57.201 --> 53:58.636
and you will help me find them!

54:17.121 --> 54:17.955
Marvel?

54:28.933 --> 54:30.468
Have you seen him?

54:30.468 --> 54:33.604
He didn't make the queue to
shelter in the annex tonight,

54:33.604 --> 54:35.039
but I've seen where he goes

54:35.039 --> 54:36.907
when he wants to
make himself scarce.

54:37.808 --> 54:39.410
I can show you,

54:39.410 --> 54:40.611
but what's in it for me?

54:54.792 --> 54:55.626
Go on.

54:57.362 --> 55:00.197
The entrance to the
tunnel's around there.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.477
Are you lost, love?

55:54.284 --> 55:55.920
Maybe we can light your away.

56:04.161 --> 56:06.597
Michael did a fine
job luring you.

56:10.935 --> 56:13.170
If you've come for your
money, it isn't here!

56:19.309 --> 56:21.045
Mr. Marvel, I'm not
looking for the money.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.580
I only seek the journals.

56:28.318 --> 56:31.756
If you want your books
so bad, come and get 'em!

56:33.023 --> 56:35.593
Don't hide behind
this pretty thing.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.427
He's not here.

56:38.395 --> 56:39.797
I'm willing to pay for it.

56:42.867 --> 56:45.603
I'll wager you'd be
willing to do a lot more

56:46.804 --> 56:49.173
before my boys let you
out of this chamber.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.415
What did he tell
you gentlemen?

56:58.415 --> 57:01.151
That an invisible man would
be coming here tonight?

57:01.151 --> 57:03.387
Surely you didn't believe
such a ludicrous claim.

57:03.387 --> 57:05.623
Marvel here's paying us
quite well to babysit him

57:05.623 --> 57:07.892
and take out his
invisible tormentor.

57:07.892 --> 57:08.826
We believe him daft,

57:08.826 --> 57:10.961
but money's money, right, boys?

57:14.264 --> 57:17.668
Marvel also told us that
a pretty little morsel

57:17.668 --> 57:19.904
would be wandering down
here by her lonesome.

57:20.838 --> 57:21.806
We didn't believe that neither,

57:21.806 --> 57:24.642
but wonder of wonders,

57:24.642 --> 57:25.476
here you are,

57:27.812 --> 57:29.547
ready for the taking.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.692
Takes a bit of effort
to pull the trigger.

57:41.692 --> 57:44.261
I guess your, uh, fingers
aren't in the practice.

57:45.462 --> 57:47.397
You should have cocked
the hammer back first.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.135
I can teach you things.

57:59.844 --> 58:01.345
Look out, you idiots!

58:21.999 --> 58:23.500
Where the hell are you?

58:25.703 --> 58:26.771
Everywhere.

58:28.138 --> 58:30.240
Run, Adeline. Run!

58:33.510 --> 58:36.013
Where are you, you blighter?

58:39.717 --> 58:42.052
Show yourself, you blighter!

59:25.262 --> 59:27.998
Congratulations, Mr. Marvel.

59:27.998 --> 59:29.967
You will get your wish.

59:29.967 --> 59:32.336
You will be locked up
for God knows how long.

59:33.470 --> 59:35.339
All you had to do was
be part of a brawl

59:35.339 --> 59:37.074
that saw two men killed.

59:38.375 --> 59:39.409
It weren't me.

59:41.111 --> 59:43.113
It were the invisible man.

59:45.382 --> 59:47.151
You don't believe me, do you?

59:48.719 --> 59:50.988
You should ask your
pretty lady friend.

59:59.529 --> 01:00:02.967
Make sure you give your pretty
little friend her toy back.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:32.429
Who killed those two men
we found on the ground?

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.464
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:00:47.745 --> 01:00:49.714
Tell me the truth, Adeline,

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:53.450
or as much of it
as you can manage.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.386
Let me help you.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.525
I was trying to
recover that journal.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.294
Marvel stole it,

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.963
and someone saved me.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:06.797
Hmm.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.903
Must be quite a book for
you to risk your life

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.038
in such a foolish manner,

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.272
and then,

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.941
a miraculous savior.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.311
I would love to shake his hand.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:22.446
What does he look like?

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:24.614
I don't know.

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.185
Height?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.019
Weight?

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:32.022
Hair and eye color?

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.623
I don't know.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.159
Mrs. Kemp,

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.128
the sole reason that I don't
drag you behind bars yourself

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:43.133
is that both you and
Mr. Marvel seem to agree

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:48.705
that someone else created
this night's mayhem.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.740
So please,

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.609
be more forthcoming.

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:56.713
Does this journal
truly belong to you?

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:00.617
Does it belong to Mr. Marvel?

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:06.423
Does it belong

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.193
to an invisible man?

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:10.527
Don't be absurd,

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:11.628
the journal's mine.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:14.965
Well, I see.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:17.768
Ominous headings in English,

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:21.371
clearly written by someone
obsessed with the morbid.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.374
And the rest?

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.077
Gibberish.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.745
It's a cipher,
I can't read it.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:31.515
Neither can I.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.986
There's a fellow down at the
station good with puzzles

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.323
who says there's a key.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.725
It seems a seven letter keyword
will unlock this cipher,

01:02:41.725 --> 01:02:44.862
but I'd be blowed if I can
think of what it might be.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.234
Mr. Marvel doesn't know the
contents in this journal either,

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.837
yet you both claim ownership.

01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:56.106
The journal belongs
to my late husband.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.707
As you know, he was a scientist.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.378
His dream was to become a
member of the Royal Society.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.081
It was all he ever wanted.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:07.918
The Reginald we
know sought to conduct

01:03:10.988 --> 01:03:12.322
human experimentation?

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:16.861
This journal

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:19.596
is lunacy.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.469
Yet I'm inclined to believe you.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.537
Seeing how fervently
you've been seeking it,

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:29.840
even to the point of
endangering yourself.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:37.214
What other reason could
you possibly have?

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:44.654
Of course,

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.324
I can't return this
gun, officially.

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:50.460
It's a murder weapon.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.731
Whatever you're caught up in,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.634
try to stay safe.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:10.026
Good day, Lord Mayor.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.698
Ah, Mrs. Kemp.

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.266
Exciting day for you.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.036
Is it true?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.705
The city council will
vote on my proposal

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:22.972
for a more humane asylum?

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.309
Well, uh,

01:07:25.309 --> 01:07:27.277
not to be impolite about it,

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:30.880
but since Councilor
Wicksteed's unfortunate

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.550
and, uh, untimely demise,

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.919
the committee work he had
stalled has been voted

01:07:35.919 --> 01:07:37.087
to move forward.

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:38.588
That does not mean

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:42.926
that your proposal has the
necessary votes to pass.

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:44.528
Who still opposes?

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:45.962
Surely I can make
them see reason.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.997
My proposal pays for
itself over the long term.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.767
You should attempt
to discuss the matter

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:52.035
with Councilor Hammond.

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:55.839
He leads the opposition
against you now.

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:56.673
Hmm.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:59.075
But, act with haste.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.777
The city council votes tomorrow.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.591
Congratulations
on the vote.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.060
Oh my God, where
have you been?

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.861
I didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.796
Are you hurt?

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.698
I'm no
worse off than usual.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.301
How long have you
been following me?

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.835
Secretly,

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.070
silently.

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:29.173
I'm a
scientist, Adeline,

01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:30.740
an observer by profession.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.242
And what good would
my observations be

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:34.378
if my subjects were
aware of my presence?

01:08:34.378 --> 01:08:37.314
Some would call that
a violation of privacy.

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.383
Others
would call it necessary.

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.485
That letter the
mayor was writing,

01:08:41.485 --> 01:08:43.587
it was addressed to
Councilor Hammond.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.589
He was warning the
gentleman about you.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:46.390
Lies.

01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:49.359
I beg your pardon!

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:50.394
Must have been the wind.

01:08:50.394 --> 01:08:51.761
The wind? Indoors?

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.730
How daft.

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:55.131
You hotheaded fool,

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.400
you never did learn to
control that temper, did you?

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.168
They aim to
vote down your proposal

01:08:58.168 --> 01:09:00.337
after a so-called heroic
effort to pass it.

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.506
How many precious years of
your life have you wasted

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:04.140
on this rotting town?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.511
You know the measure of these
men more than I do, I wager.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.145
I'm a woman

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.447
in a world of small men.

01:09:11.348 --> 01:09:13.583
It was the same at university,

01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:16.386
allowed to sit in lectures
but barred from examinations.

01:09:17.954 --> 01:09:20.357
I'm only permitted to
act through a limited set of channels.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.292
Then
make me your channel,

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.828
and in turn, you
will become mine.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:26.663
What exactly
are you proposing?

01:09:26.663 --> 01:09:28.632
I need the
other two journals.

01:09:28.632 --> 01:09:30.200
Help me reach the
police station,

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.835
and I'll get your
humble proposal passed

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:32.969
by the city council.

01:09:34.338 --> 01:09:36.273
Give me your word
you'll not hurt him.

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:38.107
There'll be no more bloodshed.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.777
Anything
for you, Adeline.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:42.145
Anything.

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:43.980
The whole world for you.

01:10:06.903 --> 01:10:07.737
Mrs. Kemp.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:12.141
Is there something
I can help you with?

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.943
I'd like to talk
to Thomas Marvel.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.415
I fail to see how that
would be productive.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.183
He stole three
journals, not one.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.853
Journals that belong to
my dear late husband,

01:10:23.853 --> 01:10:25.221
his final legacy to me.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.636
I'll ask him the questions.

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:40.704
You stay silent.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:41.505
You understand?

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.515
Can't
keep me here, Adye,

01:10:51.515 --> 01:10:52.649
it's not safe!

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:54.784
Quiet, Albert!

01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:02.826
If he admits to having
two more stolen journals,

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:05.094
I'll try to convince
him to surrender them.

01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:18.508
What's she doing here?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.845
The lady claims you have
two more of her journals

01:11:21.845 --> 01:11:24.414
in your hidden stash
somewhere around town.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.215
Those journals belong to me.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.352
Mr. Marvel,

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.687
how shall I put this?

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.422
It doesn't take a
detective to know

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:35.525
that the journals are beyond
a man of your education.

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:36.660
Hmm?

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.227
A supposition
bolstered by the fact

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.029
you cannot tell me the contents.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.465
Oh, and she can read 'em?

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.535
Mrs. Kemp claims
her late husband,

01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:46.903
a scientist, wrote them.

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.373
You'll have to forgive me

01:11:49.373 --> 01:11:52.409
if I find her version of
events slightly more plausible.

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:57.013
You've killed me, Adye.

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:01.418
You've led the invisible
man right to me.

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:05.989
She's in league with him.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:07.691
Ask her!

01:12:09.292 --> 01:12:13.062
You can tell it, it's written
all over her lying face!

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:14.898
Mrs. Kemp,

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:19.035
would you please try to
explain to Mr. Marvel

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:22.271
that you do not have
an invisible man following you around?

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:24.340
Just give me the journals,

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.510
and this can all be over.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:30.547
If you're so terrified
of this invisible man,

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:31.981
why not give up the journals?

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.617
You don't know him like I do!

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.052
And I'd wager that
you don't know him

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:38.655
as well as you think
you do either, missy!

01:12:40.624 --> 01:12:43.092
Giving him the books back
won't be the end of it.

01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:48.264
No, it'll just be the beginning,

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:50.400
for all of us.

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:54.237
Are my ears deceiving me

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:56.906
or did I actually
hear a note of concern

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.174
for your fellow man?

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:01.010
It ain't your ears
that be deceiving you.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.216
He won't give them up.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.022
Hey!

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.391
Don't leave me here with him!

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.093
With whom?

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.795
The invisible man?

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.030
Oh, invisible man,

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:24.067
please stop harassing
this poor, unfortunate.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.603
Blast you, you fool!

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.938
You don't know
what you're doing!

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:31.975
Perhaps I should support
your asylum after all.

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:34.410
This is blood on
your hands, Adye!

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.113
It's blood on your hands, Adye!

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.849
It's blood on your hands!

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:19.923
You're undressed.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.058
I asked you to make
yourself decent.

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:24.360
I'd forgotten
how very lovely you are.

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.430
I have them, Adeline,

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.065
my precious journals,

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.900
and I have you to thank for it.

01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:33.102
What about Marvel?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:35.271
He's fine.

01:14:36.339 --> 01:14:37.907
Now you'll find a cure.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.408
The cure?

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:41.845
There is no affliction, Adeline.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:44.247
As you said, my achievements
were remarkable,

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:46.415
that I would rewrite
science as we know it.

01:14:47.584 --> 01:14:48.918
You've done a
very great thing,

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.487
a great and terrible thing,

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.589
but it scares me.

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:57.927
I'm only
just beginning to realize

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:00.730
the extraordinary advantages
invisibility gives me.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.100
But until I find a cure,

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.770
I must have a partner.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:09.873
A partner?

01:15:09.873 --> 01:15:11.274
I must have you.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.378
Are you not wary of
being invisible yourself?

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:18.214
Alone in this house,
in your public causes?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.819
Are you not tired of
being a woman unseen,

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:24.554
a voice unheard?

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:30.059
The world will hear both
our voices before too long.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.614
Margaret?

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.219
Have you seen Margaret?

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:31.420
No, ma'am,

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.588
but I found a note from
her in the kitchen.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:34.190
She's gone to her
sister's in town there,

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.092
she thinks she's coming
down with the flu.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:36.926
A note?

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:40.396
Thank you, Evie.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:42.899
Good luck today, Mrs. Kemp.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.233
I'm sorry?

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.501
The city council?

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.671
I heard they're voting
on your asylum today.

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:50.306
Yes, thank you
for reminding me.

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:05.188
You seem to be in
high spirits today.

01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:07.957
It could almost be like we
were at university again,

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.994
you and Reginald fussing over
all the beakers and tubes,

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.929
every breakthrough a
triumph.

01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:14.798
I have every
reason to be happy.

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.465
I have my journals back,

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.368
and I was finally
able to test a cure.

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.670
It had flaws.

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:23.072
Right now, it's more
like a slow poison.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.040
But sooner or later,

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.909
a full cure will be mine.

01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:29.679
Then my invisibility shall
truly become a tool of power.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.415
I don't understand,

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:33.883
Surely when you
formulate a cure,

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:36.052
you'll just become
visible again, correct?

01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:38.087
My invisibility
gives me advantages

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.256
too valuable to
simply toss aside.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.892
But with a cure,

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:46.696
both of us can be visible
and invisible at will.

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.164
Me invisible?

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.098
Perhaps I will share

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:51.134
with you the secrets of my work,

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.402
the key word that
unlocks the cipher.

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:54.637
- Griffin, I don't want-
- But this is,

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:57.606
this is day one of year
one of the new epoch,

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.009
the epoch of the invisible man!

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:03.747
We'll begin with Port Burdock

01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:06.082
and your humble proposal
to the city council.

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:08.985
I almost forgot!

01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:12.255
Today, it passes the vote
because I say it passes!

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:15.925
Griffin, wait!

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.447
Ah, Mrs. Kemp.

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.017
Mayor Edeson, I
must talk to you.

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:43.486
The vote will be held
this afternoon, my dear,

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.754
don't fret.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.155
But first, a spot of
luncheon at my club.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:47.356
No, I, uh-

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.858
We're still a little
behind, of course,

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.827
but then, I did have the
devil's luck trying to get

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.561
into the city this morning.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.463
And then there are, well,

01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:57.934
just so many important
votes to get through.

01:18:57.934 --> 01:19:00.904
But rest assured, we
will consider your ideas

01:19:00.904 --> 01:19:04.473
with the utmost deliberation
and care that they deserve.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:07.176
Whether the vote goes
in your favor, I-

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.012
Perhaps it might
be safer to delay.

01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:10.947
Delay?

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:13.149
My dear girl,

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.951
you've spent months
hounding the councilors

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.719
and now you wish to delay?

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:17.887
You must understand,

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:19.755
the bank and the
money and Wicksteed...

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.691
Oh my God, Wicksteed.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.994
Time to clean house.

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:49.853
Two men

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.488
who opposed your charitable
proposals have been killed,

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.290
including the mayor
of Port Burdock.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:00.263
I find it

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:03.732
too convenient to
be coincidence.

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:07.303
The bank theft and the dead men,

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.005
the men in the tunnels.

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:13.943
Marshal Wicksteed, Mayor Edeson.

01:20:15.044 --> 01:20:16.913
And last night,

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:18.081
Thomas Marvel.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:21.985
Marvel?

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.396
We found him like that
just hours after your visit.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:37.733
What part did you play in this?

01:20:38.601 --> 01:20:39.435
Did you

01:20:40.536 --> 01:20:42.038
steal a key when you were here?

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:48.777
No, it's worse.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.181
I let him inside.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.520
Does the culprit have a name?

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.690
Griffin. His name
is Cade Griffin.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.927
Where is he? What
does he look like?

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.229
That's the problem.

01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:15.138
The idea is ludicrous.

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:18.674
I want to hear you say it.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:19.976
Look me in the eye!

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.112
Tell me with a straight face

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:25.915
that an invisible man
committed these crimes.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:29.718
An invisible man-

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.120
Robbed the bank?

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.055
Yes.

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:33.422
Murdered Mr. Wicksteed.

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:35.124
- Yes!
- Killed the mayor,

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:37.726
tortured Thomas Marvel to death!

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.966
My God, Adeline.

01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:45.068
I don't know what I've
done or what I was doing.

01:21:46.469 --> 01:21:48.237
It was just such a miracle
scientific endeavor.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:50.739
Think of what could be
done with such an advance.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.310
I never thought he would.

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:57.546
In his younger days, he was...

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:01.484
Marvel's right.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.354
He's crazed, and he's dangerous.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.958
But not invincible.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.460
It's time you chose a side.

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.648
Oh, dear God.

01:23:58.434 --> 01:23:59.235
Margaret.

01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:22.125
I was finally
able to test a cure.

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:25.194
It has flaws.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:27.596
Right now, it's more
like a slow poison.

01:24:38.974 --> 01:24:39.808
Help.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.945
He's a madman!

01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:44.046
Oh my God!

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:41.404
♪ My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:25:41.404 --> 01:25:44.507
♪ I disdain all
glittering gold ♪

01:25:44.507 --> 01:25:48.043
♪ There is nothing

01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:51.814
♪ But my jolly sailor bold

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:54.550

01:25:58.287 --> 01:25:59.188
Mrs. Kemp?

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.058
I'm so sorry, Evie.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.141
What's going on?

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.966
I don't understand, ma'am!

01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:45.301
Run, Evie, go!

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:18.801
Your final
obstacle removed.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.337
Your proposal will pass.

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:22.438
Yes, I'll get what I want,

01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:24.106
at the cost of our souls.

01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:27.109
Oh, we are above
man's small, petty morality.

01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:28.744
As Evie knows to her cost.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.814
A
little fun, nothing more.

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:34.417
You remain the true
object to my desire.

01:27:36.619 --> 01:27:37.586
And Margaret?

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:40.255
So you
found Margaret.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.590
What was left of her.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.429
She was
nothing, a lab rat.

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:48.631
You must think bigger, my love.

01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:50.499
The cure draws
closer day by day,

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:52.067
and with it, our power.

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:56.204
Griffin, what you
could have been.

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.312
Is that the girl?

01:28:03.312 --> 01:28:05.113
It's just the house settling.

01:28:06.148 --> 01:28:08.317
I want to see.

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.091
Colonel Adye, seize him!

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.461
Adeline.

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:19.962
You bitch!

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:33.676
You want her for yourself, Adye.

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:36.011
I can see right through you.

01:28:47.356 --> 01:28:50.025
Don't let him get away!

01:28:58.501 --> 01:29:00.536
Colonel Adye!

01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:03.372
Stay here.

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:10.913
He could be anywhere.

01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:26.495
Adye!

01:29:30.599 --> 01:29:33.068
You'll get me
back in that house, Adye.

01:29:34.169 --> 01:29:35.638
You'll get me my journals.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:38.240
You're a fool

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.809
if you think she'll
open the door to me now.

01:29:40.809 --> 01:29:43.278
And a bigger fool if you
think I'd put her at risk.

01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:46.849
You think
you could win her heart?

01:29:46.849 --> 01:29:48.584
When she could have me,

01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:50.619
a god among men?

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:53.021
You may have
blown your chance.

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.257
It seems she
disapproves of murder!

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:05.133
I want
my journals, Adeline!

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.569
I must have them!

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:10.506
With my journals, with the cure,

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:13.942
the reign of the
invisible man will begin!

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.366
I don't want to
hurt you, Griffin.

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:40.435
Even now, I don't
want to shoot you.

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.471
If you take one single
step inside this room,

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.172
if you don't leave
now and forever,

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.440
I'll burn your damn journals.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.242
I will
not be stopped.

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:48.911
Neither will I, not in this.

01:30:48.911 --> 01:30:50.345
If you
destroy my work,

01:30:50.345 --> 01:30:52.581
you'll die here
tonight, Adeline.

01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:54.216
You'll die!

01:30:54.216 --> 01:30:56.084
I don't think it matters.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:58.554
I haven't lived
in years!

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:00.756
No!

01:31:02.057 --> 01:31:04.026
You'll burn, Adeline!

01:31:04.026 --> 01:31:05.227
You'll burn!

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:16.404
You're mad!
You'll kill us both!

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:18.707
I would have
been a king, Adeline,

01:31:18.707 --> 01:31:20.543
and you my queen!

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:24.312
You could have tasted greatness.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.681
Greatness!

01:31:25.681 --> 01:31:27.916
Instead of the mediocrity
you settled for.

01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:30.452
For Reginald!

01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:33.455
Reginald with his small
thinking and his cowardice.

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:35.891
With his decency
and his gentleness!

01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:38.561
He was half
the scientist I was!

01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:43.131
But twice the man!

01:31:52.374 --> 01:31:54.677
Adeline!

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:36.018
Adeline!

01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:52.134
What we could have
done together.

01:32:52.134 --> 01:32:53.501
Terrible things.

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:54.937
Wonderful things!

01:32:54.937 --> 01:32:56.471
Every door open to us,

01:32:56.471 --> 01:32:59.341
every luxury ours
for the taking,

01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:01.576
every enemy crushed.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.345
Theft and murder.

01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:05.681
There
is no murder in war.

01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:07.115
War, Adeline.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.852
An army of invisible
men at my command.

01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:11.687
The world on its knees.

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:13.288
It's what we wanted.

01:33:14.289 --> 01:33:15.490
No.

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:16.324
Never that.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.328
I was in awe of your power,
Griffin, your discovery,

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:22.364
but it's made you a monster.

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:25.000
It's made me a king.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.034
A king!

01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:53.495
Griffin.

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:00.002
There you are.

01:34:00.903 --> 01:34:01.737
Adeline.

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:08.677
What a waste it would've been

01:34:09.745 --> 01:34:13.615
for such beauty to be invisible.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:17.820
Adeline.

01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.455
Always Adeline.

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:23.325
My love.

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:26.128
My muse.

01:34:32.034 --> 01:34:33.035
My codeword.

01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:36.905
My key.

01:34:40.075 --> 01:34:40.909
Adeline.

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.847
Is it over?

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.216
It's over.

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.586
I should have left
it to you all along.

01:35:28.023 --> 01:35:30.158
It was all for you, you know.

01:35:30.158 --> 01:35:31.994
He did it all for you.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.364
In the beginning, perhaps,

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:37.766
before power corrupted.

01:35:39.968 --> 01:35:42.104
It was in the wrong
hands, I suppose.

01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:44.840
Can't say I blame him.

01:35:46.341 --> 01:35:47.409
Well, not entirely.

01:35:49.711 --> 01:35:50.946
I suppose, in a way,

01:35:53.648 --> 01:35:55.350
