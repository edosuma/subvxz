00:01.784 --> 00:03.307
NISCHELLE:
They are stars from sports,

00:03.351 --> 00:06.441
TV, film and music.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.486
But before
their fame and renown,

00:08.530 --> 00:10.923
most started out
with only hopes and dreams.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.665
And I'm like, "Oh, my God.
He's gonna make the Olympics."

00:13.709 --> 00:16.842
We're lifting, you know. I'd be
like, "Come on, push yourself.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.801
Man made it. Man can lift it."

00:18.844 --> 00:21.195
NISCHELLE: Now, in an emotional
journey back in time...

00:21.238 --> 00:22.892
This was my room.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.286
Uncle Roy used
to always take care of me.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.157
-Always babysit me.
-...these celebrities

00:27.201 --> 00:29.377
are returning home to give back

00:29.420 --> 00:30.334
to that special someone...

00:30.378 --> 00:32.293
Mom, this is for you.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.643
-Did I do it? Okay.
-ROB: You got to hit it
harder than that.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.906
...who helped lead them
to greatness.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.342
She encouraged us.
She was like, "You guys need

00:38.386 --> 00:39.691
to go chase your dreams."

00:39.735 --> 00:41.171
You changed
the course of my life.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.086
And you didn't mess it up.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.089
-What do you think
she would love?
-Everything.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.395
[laughter]

00:47.438 --> 00:50.093
With the help
of an amazing design team...

00:50.137 --> 00:51.747
We're halfway home.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.706
...now featuring
Survivor legend Boston Rob...

00:54.750 --> 00:56.578
When the boys
in Boston see this,

00:56.621 --> 00:57.840
it's gonna be all over.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.668
-...and lot of hard work...
-[laughter]

01:02.018 --> 01:04.803
Whoa! Yes, Kandi!

01:04.846 --> 01:07.589
...these celebrities
are on a mission to say

01:07.632 --> 01:10.592
thank you
with a surprise home renovation.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.028
Oh, my God!

01:12.072 --> 01:14.770
I'm here where I'm at
because of you, so...

01:14.813 --> 01:16.511
I love you, too.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.556
Tonight...

01:18.600 --> 01:20.602
ANNOUNCER:
Is he superhuman?

01:20.645 --> 01:22.646
TERRY GANNON: The best skater
in the world just brought it

01:22.691 --> 01:24.649
on the biggest stage
in the world.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.260
JOHNNY WEIR:
And this performance

01:26.303 --> 01:27.696
was the absolute best

01:27.739 --> 01:29.393
of what Nathan Chen does.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.351
NISCHELLE:
...Olympic gold medalist

01:30.394 --> 01:32.179
and figure skating phenom

01:32.222 --> 01:35.573
Nathan Chen takes us
back to his hometown

01:35.616 --> 01:36.835
of Salt Lake City, Utah...

01:36.878 --> 01:38.446
I haven't been back
in a while, too,

01:38.489 --> 01:40.012
so I haven't seen
the mountains at all.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.189
...where long ago,
the local skating community

01:42.232 --> 01:44.669
guided his first steps
onto the ice.

01:44.713 --> 01:45.888
NISCHELLE:
This is the place

01:45.931 --> 01:47.237
-where it all began.
-This is the place.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.934
...and set him on the path
to Olympic gold

01:48.978 --> 01:49.761
in Beijing.

01:49.805 --> 01:50.848
I spent so much time here.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.547
Everything seems a lot smaller.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.810
[whooping, cheering]

01:54.853 --> 01:56.027
Now Nathan is thanking
his hometown...

01:56.072 --> 01:57.769
ROB: They teach you that
in figure skating?

01:57.813 --> 01:59.989
-They don't teach you that.
-My man.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.686
...by renovating
the Salt Lake City

02:01.730 --> 02:04.341
sports complex
in honor of his parents

02:04.385 --> 02:05.995
and the coaches
who believed in him.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.650
And even though
Nathan will be hard at work...

02:08.693 --> 02:11.087
ROB:
In and pull the outside out.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.785
...he'll take time to show me
the people and places...

02:13.829 --> 02:16.701
-And then we grow up
to be a tree.
-Oh!

02:16.745 --> 02:20.183
...that helped shape him
into the champion he is today.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.576
Out there somewhere

02:21.619 --> 02:23.404
could be the next Nathan Chen.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.623
-Watching, waiting, hoping.
-Yeah.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.583
Nathan Chen's journey home
begins now

02:28.626 --> 02:31.803
onSecret Celebrity Renovation.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.897
NISCHELLE:
Salt Lake City.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.421
-NATHAN: Yep.
-First of all,

02:40.464 --> 02:41.552
when I woke up this morning,

02:41.596 --> 02:43.466
I was like, "Holy cow,

02:43.511 --> 02:44.555
-this place is gorgeous."
-Yeah.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.731
No, I agree. I haven't been back

02:46.775 --> 02:48.385
in a while, too,
so actually it's, like,

02:48.429 --> 02:50.257
I've missed seeing the mountains
and all of this. It's so nice.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.780
NISCHELLE: Yeah, well, I mean,
you do have a good reason

02:51.823 --> 02:53.129
-that you haven't been here.
-Sure.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.827
You just went and won
a gold medal

02:55.871 --> 02:57.567
-for the U.S. of A. [laughs]
-Thanks.

02:57.612 --> 03:00.092
By the way, we all were just...

03:00.136 --> 03:02.312
I mean,
"Nathan Chen, Nathan Chen."

03:02.356 --> 03:03.574
"It's gonna happen.
He's gonna get a gold."

03:03.618 --> 03:05.272
Like, did you feel that?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.839
I mean, I was hoping, you know,
I was dreaming about it.

03:07.883 --> 03:11.060
I love the fact that when
I asked you, like, "Hey, Nathan,

03:11.103 --> 03:14.411
is there somebody that
you wanted to say thank you to?"

03:14.455 --> 03:17.980
You were like, "There's
actually been a ton of people."

03:18.023 --> 03:19.677
Yeah, there were so
many people in my career

03:19.721 --> 03:20.939
-that have helped me so much.
-Mm-hmm.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.246
Um, but my first steps
on the ice were

03:23.290 --> 03:24.508
at this sports complex.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.640
I was three years old,

03:25.683 --> 03:27.119
-never skated before.
-Wow.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.078
So I started doing
a group class,

03:29.121 --> 03:30.558
and then the lady
that was running the group class

03:30.601 --> 03:32.037
at the time asked my mom
if I could do privates.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.388
And that first coach
was Stephanee Grosscup,

03:34.430 --> 03:36.520
and she was the person that
really introduced me to skating.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.261
And through that,
you know, I think it just

03:38.305 --> 03:40.089
really stuck with me.
And through all the good times,

03:40.132 --> 03:41.829
all the bad times, I've
always reverted back to that.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.266
You know,
that sort of early passion

03:43.310 --> 03:44.833
that Stephanie
sort of instilled in me

03:44.876 --> 03:46.356
-to get me through
all the times.
-Aw.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.053
I love that.
So we went from Stephanie to...

03:48.097 --> 03:49.968
NATHAN:
To a man named Karel Kovar.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.317
And then from there,
I started working

03:51.361 --> 03:53.406
with a lady
named Evgeniya Chernyshova.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.930
She helped teach me how to
train, how to sort of structure

03:55.974 --> 03:57.933
programs before competitions
and all of that.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.327
-NISCHELLE: Mm-hmm.
-And yeah, that was
my early childhood

04:00.370 --> 04:02.372
up until I was around 12 or 13.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.460
And then, beyond that, you know,

04:03.504 --> 04:05.419
of course,
my parents, my family.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.508
-Can't wait to meet your mom.
-Yeah, she's amazing.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.423
I mean, being, you know,
an immigrant from China,

04:09.466 --> 04:11.120
not being able to speak
the language, not having

04:11.163 --> 04:13.035
the finances in her own life
to really

04:13.078 --> 04:15.777
support everything
that we thought we needed,

04:15.820 --> 04:17.605
she somehow made it happen
for all of us.

04:17.648 --> 04:18.606
So it-it's amazing.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.694
I get a better picture now

04:19.737 --> 04:21.522
of, number one, why you said,

04:21.565 --> 04:22.827
"I can't just pick one."

04:22.871 --> 04:25.308
So how much do they know?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.615
They know of the project,
but I don't think they know

04:27.658 --> 04:29.747
-exactly that they're
being honored for this project.
-Got it.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.967
And that I'm, you know, sort of
in a sense of dedicating it

04:32.010 --> 04:33.360
to them
and all their support for me,

04:33.403 --> 04:35.405
um, but, yeah, that's
going to be a cool surprise.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.798
Nathan Chen. I love this.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.974
Before this process is done,

04:39.017 --> 04:40.976
you're gonna let your girl
see the gold medal, right?

04:41.019 --> 04:42.630
-Absolutely, will do.
-I love it.

04:43.718 --> 04:47.330
NISCHELLE:
How did you pick, like, doing
something at the sports complex?

04:47.374 --> 04:49.463
This community has done
so much for me, so

04:49.506 --> 04:51.900
anything that I can sort of
do to help them and...

04:51.943 --> 04:53.162
being able to have
some of these rooms

04:53.205 --> 04:55.382
and some of these things
that we're now going

04:55.425 --> 04:57.558
to be implementing into the
rink, uh, will be really good

04:57.601 --> 04:59.037
for the figure skating community
in Salt Lake City.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.648
Just to give them,
you know, a space

05:00.691 --> 05:02.389
that is dedicated
to figure skating.

05:02.432 --> 05:03.825
Little Nathan Chen.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.828
-Somebody's got your back. Good.
-[laughs]

05:06.871 --> 05:09.004
NISCHELLE: All right,
let's get to work.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.571
This is the place
where it all began.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.660
NATHAN: This is the place.
I spent a lot of hours here.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.662
NISCHELLE:
Ooh, here we are.

05:14.705 --> 05:17.317
-Wow.
-I spent so much time here.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.970
-Everything seems
a lot smaller...
-[both laugh]

05:19.014 --> 05:20.798
...than I, than I remember.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.366
NISCHELLE:
Rob and Sabrina will be here
in a little bit.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.586
♪

05:26.674 --> 05:28.240
I love watching the Olympics.

05:28.284 --> 05:31.243
I grew up,
my family used to turn it on

05:31.287 --> 05:33.028
all the time, and it would be
one of those things

05:33.071 --> 05:35.335
that brought
the entire family together.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.380
My mom would make us snacks.
And it was just fun.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.600
You know what's cool is like,
this year, my kids

05:39.643 --> 05:42.298
were old enough to watch
the Olympics for the first time.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.866
And they were so excited
when Nathan won the gold.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.303
And they actually
figure skate now.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.611
-Really?
-Yeah, they started
taking lessons just this year.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.047
-I love that.
-Yeah.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.222
You have to tell Nathan
that story.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.272
-Here they are. Hi. Yes.
-Hi! Nice to meet you.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.274
-Nathan, this is Sabrina.
-Nice to meet you.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.451
And this is Rob. He's gonna
make you all stretch

06:04.494 --> 06:06.714
your muscles a little bit
because it's out of the box.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.150
-ROB: This is different.
-Absolutely.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.065
-Right, we'll follow you.
-Let's check it out.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.197
This sorts complex
has been more or less the same

06:12.241 --> 06:14.330
for the past 20 years,
which is amazing because it's,

06:14.374 --> 06:17.332
uh, so reminiscent
of the 2002 Olympics and all

06:17.377 --> 06:20.205
that the 2002 Olympics
carried for this community.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.685
But, unfortunately,
the sports complex never

06:21.729 --> 06:23.034
really had a dedicated location

06:23.078 --> 06:25.428
for skaters,
even when I was here.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.430
So I want to create spaces for,
one, the athletes themselves,

06:27.474 --> 06:29.345
for figure skaters to
have a place to decompress that

06:29.389 --> 06:31.434
is just for the figure skaters,
but then also

06:31.478 --> 06:34.089
for a space for the parents
to sort of decompress,

06:34.132 --> 06:37.179
-keep an eye on the kid.
-Is this you?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.876
-NATHAN: Oh, my God.
-NISCHELLE: Is it?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.487
NATHAN:
Yes, that is, that is indeed me.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.836
-NISCHELLE: Oh, my gosh...
-NATHAN: That's funny.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.403
Look how little Nathan is!

06:43.446 --> 06:45.534
I love seeing this.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.364
SABRINA: Working with Nathan
is going to be fun, but because

06:48.408 --> 06:50.192
the whole community
is coming to the ceremony

06:50.235 --> 06:52.194
and the open house,
I feel like there's

06:52.237 --> 06:53.543
a lot more pressure on me
on this one.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.284
I want to start taking a look

06:55.327 --> 06:57.591
at the spaces that we're
doing because we've got,

06:57.634 --> 06:59.070
-you know,
I have a lot of decisions.
-She wants to get to work.

06:59.114 --> 07:00.768
-[laughter]
-Come on, man, let's do it.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.031
SABRINA: The first room
that he wants to renovate

07:03.074 --> 07:04.293
is an outdated concession stand

07:04.336 --> 07:05.990
that's not even
being used anymore.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.470
Wow, this reminds me
of high school.

07:07.514 --> 07:09.037
This is concessions.
I know, right?

07:09.080 --> 07:10.430
Can I get a hot dog
and a popcorn?

07:10.473 --> 07:14.477
ROB: Okay, so talk us
through your vision here.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.305
I think it would be great
to be able to have sort of like

07:16.348 --> 07:18.263
a place where skaters
can put their skates on,

07:18.307 --> 07:19.743
sort of just get ready,
um, and just kind

07:19.787 --> 07:21.484
of have like a home within
the skating rink, you know?

07:21.528 --> 07:24.661
So basically a locker room
dedicated just to skaters?

07:24.705 --> 07:25.880
Yes, exactly.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.185
And how many people are gonna

07:27.229 --> 07:28.752
use this dressing room
at the time?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.711
-Between six to 12, I'd say.
-Okay.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.539
NATHAN:
It would be cool to have some
sort of locker space here or

07:32.582 --> 07:34.715
someplace that we can, you know,
dedicate putting stuff down.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.586
Um, and then having, like,
maybe, like, benches

07:36.630 --> 07:38.283
or benches along the side here.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.372
-Then rubber flooring is
definitely a very big need.
-Yeah.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.549
-ROB: Definitely,
for the skates.
-NATHAN: For the skates, yeah.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.854
ROB:
This whole opening,

07:43.898 --> 07:46.030
I want to take this down
and close it in.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.598
-Maybe some mirrors.
-Okay. I'll do mirrors,

07:48.642 --> 07:51.688
sconces, dressing areas, tables,
chairs, the whole thing.

07:51.732 --> 07:54.517
Converting this concession stand
into a staging area

07:54.561 --> 07:57.215
for figure skaters is a lot
to take on in two weeks.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.609
But Nathan's counting on us
to deliver.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.481
So we'll start by removing

08:01.524 --> 08:03.439
all of the concession
equipment and rolling door.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.441
Then we'll close up
the vending window

08:05.485 --> 08:07.922
and cover up all that
high school yellow cinder block

08:07.965 --> 08:09.619
to make it feel more cozy.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.492
Then we'll finish it up
by adding everything the skaters

08:12.535 --> 08:15.625
need, including rubber
floorings, lockers, benches,

08:15.669 --> 08:17.148
and a nice vanity.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.715
What other rooms
are we gonna tackle?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.543
We have this area here, too.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.197
-Let's check this out. Yeah.
-Wh-What, we're doing that, too?

08:23.372 --> 08:25.330
ROB:
What do you think about in here?

08:25.374 --> 08:27.419
NATHAN:
I guess in the back
would be good

08:27.463 --> 08:28.638
to have some changing areas just
to switch from street clothes

08:28.682 --> 08:30.161
to skating clothes and whatnot.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.554
So this will
be the dressing room.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.817
-Okay.
-So again,
benches you need, right?

08:33.861 --> 08:35.471
-Yeah, some benches.
-Rubber floor.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.732
Rubber flooring. Yeah.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.561
Like, stalls here.
Changing stalls.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.432
Yeah, I would say that would
make more sense, to have...

08:40.476 --> 08:42.652
And then mirrors again,
maybe full length mirrors

08:42.696 --> 08:45.263
-that you could see yourself.
-Yeah, I think that'd be great.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.569
What do you think for,
like, color schemes?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.266
Like, what kind
of feeling do you want?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.486
Just things that feel warm,
feel open.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.706
Um, you know, especially when
you're in the rink all the time,

08:52.749 --> 08:54.403
you can't really see natural
light, so things that are bright

08:54.446 --> 08:56.405
and, like, just, like,
inviting, I suppose.

08:56.448 --> 08:57.754
I don't know exactly.
I'm not a designer myself,

08:57.798 --> 08:59.713
so I don't know exactly
how to quantify that.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.758
I got it, I got it.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.631
Nathan wants us to turn this
section into a changing room.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.198
So we'll remove the ice machine
and refrigerators,

09:07.242 --> 09:09.461
lay down more
rubber flooring and benches.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.681
But, in here, we'll build
private changing stalls

09:11.725 --> 09:13.857
and add full-length mirrors.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.642
All right. The pro shop.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.209
NATHAN: I would love
to have this become a place

09:18.253 --> 09:20.647
where skaters, coaches,
parents can go to,

09:20.690 --> 09:22.213
to lounge and relax.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.781
Or have parents sort of
be able to see

09:24.825 --> 09:26.174
how their athletes are doing

09:26.217 --> 09:27.523
while in
a very comfortable space.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.743
SABRINA: So this isn't
being used as a pro shop?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.614
NATHAN: No, virtually
just storage at this point.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.182
So this should be the lounge
for people's family

09:34.225 --> 09:35.400
and friends
coming to see them skate.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.359
So the mothers
don't have to freeze.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.579
-Oh, my goodness,
that's such a good idea.
-Yes.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.929
NISCHELLE: I love that.
So was there anything that

09:41.972 --> 09:44.366
like, your mom,
when she was here every day,

09:44.409 --> 09:46.281
that she wished
she would have had?

09:46.324 --> 09:47.456
I mean,
she always had coffee on her,

09:47.499 --> 09:49.197
so coffee machines, absolutely.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.720
Coffee station, there we go.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.026
I'm Cuban. We love coffee.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.854
-Yeah, yeah.
-I can do coffee.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.638
The only thing is you can't
really see the rink from here.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.640
What if we have, like,
a big-screen TV

09:57.684 --> 10:00.208
so that you could see
the rink from in here?

10:00.251 --> 10:02.384
-A monitor.
-Oh, with, like, a camera?

10:02.427 --> 10:03.777
Yeah. So, like,
closed-circuit television.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.824
So sofas, seating,
area rugs, plush...

10:07.868 --> 10:10.653
After we rip everything out,
including the service desk

10:10.697 --> 10:12.481
and separate storage room,

10:12.524 --> 10:14.918
I'll turn this pro shop
into a lounge so nice,

10:14.962 --> 10:17.225
these parents are never
gonna want to leave.

10:17.268 --> 10:20.010
New walls, a working desk,
beverage station,

10:20.054 --> 10:22.317
and most importantly,
lots of couches and chairs

10:22.360 --> 10:24.319
so the parents can
be warm and comfy

10:24.362 --> 10:26.190
while watching their kids skate.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.584
I am gonna leave you guys
because you do have

10:28.628 --> 10:30.194
a lot of work to do,
but I know it's gonna be

10:30.238 --> 10:32.370
a labor of love
for all of you all.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.676
-Especially you. All right?
-Absolutely.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.199
-We got to get to work.
-I'll see you soon.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.331
-All right, bring it in.
-All right.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.246
One, two, three, team.
One, two, three.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.117
-ALL: Team!
-All right, see ya.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.945
We'll cut it right in half.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.687
ROB:
The counter in this room
is way too big.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.821
This is the perfect job
for Nathan to start on.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.997
You're going to hold it here.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.783
-You got it?
-NATHAN: Yeah.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.263
So just hold it there.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.746
This may be his first demo,
but he's picking it right up.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.661
Let's go, Nathan.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.054
-[Sabrina whooping]
-There you go, there you go!

11:04.098 --> 11:05.752
-Yeah.
-I knew you had it in you.

11:05.795 --> 11:09.059
There you go, there you go.

11:09.103 --> 11:11.409
-[Sabrina whoops]
-Nathan!

11:11.453 --> 11:14.499
-You got the golden demo.
-You got it.

11:14.543 --> 11:15.631
They teach you that
in figure skating?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.546
-They don't teach you that.
-My man.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.461
I think my demolition routine
could definitely use some work,

11:19.504 --> 11:21.811
but it's my first time at it,
so I'll take it easy on myself.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.248
So take that hammer and just...

11:24.292 --> 11:27.164
X marks the spot.
Put it right through.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.340
[whooping, cheering]

11:29.384 --> 11:31.038
Let's go, buddy.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.606
-Just keep going at it?
-Keep going!

11:34.650 --> 11:35.956
It's got to come down!

11:37.174 --> 11:40.134
All right, Nathan,
let's work from inside here.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.876
All right, let's do
the same thing right here.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.225
-NATHAN: All right...
-Take this spot out.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.966
Okay, just push in?

11:46.009 --> 11:48.751
Yeah, push right in.
There you go, there you go.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.840
-Oh, that's much easier.
-ROB: Way easier, right?

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
-Yeah, that's much easier.
-A better technique.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.670
[exhales]

11:54.714 --> 11:56.106
What, are we on a coffee break
here or something?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.239
Yeah, I want a coffee break.
I just did all that.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.458
-The whole wall's got
to come down, Nathan.
-[Sabrina laughing]

12:02.852 --> 12:04.898
NISCHELLE:
Coming up, Rob transforms Nathan

12:04.941 --> 12:07.248
-into a construction machine.
-Wow.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.468
And Nathan transforms Rob
into a figure skater.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.035
NATHAN:
Ooh, I like it.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.384
[laughs]

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
And later, Nathan and I
make a special visit

12:15.343 --> 12:17.214
and take a trip down
memory lane.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.739
-Oh, look at him!
-That's sweet.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.305
I remember sitting there
and I'm like,

12:21.349 --> 12:24.308
"Oh, my God, he's gonna
make the Olympics."

12:24.352 --> 12:27.398
Like, finally, his dream
is gonna come true.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.320
NISCHELLE: Nathan Chen has
returned home to renovate

12:36.364 --> 12:38.192
the Salt Lake City
Sports Complex

12:38.235 --> 12:40.542
where he first learned to skate.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.849
Everything seems a lot smaller

12:42.892 --> 12:45.242
-than I, than I remember.
-Yeah.

12:45.286 --> 12:48.289
And his parents and
three figure skating coaches

12:48.332 --> 12:50.813
have no idea that
he will be dedicating

12:50.857 --> 12:53.947
this entire renovation
in their honor.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.303
ROB:
There you go.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.217
NATHAN:
I've never done this before,

13:03.260 --> 13:04.305
but, yeah, I'm super excited

13:04.348 --> 13:06.089
to see how it's gonna turn out.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.656
I know it's gonna be great.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.353
I wish my mom had something
like this when we were,

13:09.397 --> 13:11.138
when I was a kid,
so this is gonna be super cool.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.140
Demolition is
the fun part, Nathan.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.229
-Yeah.
-But putting it back together...

13:15.272 --> 13:16.752
No, no, no,
the decorating is the fun part.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.841
-Oh! Here we go, here we go.
-Oh, yeah, that's true.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.495
SABRINA:
So now that we are gonna

13:20.538 --> 13:22.714
close this up completely,
now it's just gonna be

13:22.758 --> 13:25.456
-this huge blank canvas,
literally.
-Right.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.894
-We need to fill it up.
-Absolutely, yeah.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.504
SABRINA: You know,
I love the bulletin board

13:29.547 --> 13:31.158
with all of Nathan's photos,
but I feel like

13:31.201 --> 13:32.289
we need something
a little more colorful

13:32.333 --> 13:34.814
to inspire these young skaters.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.163
And I have the perfect idea.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.555
What if we do some sort of,

13:37.599 --> 13:39.296
-like, mural?
-[loud banging]

13:39.340 --> 13:41.429
-That would be very cool.
-Yeah.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.518
Yeah, some art
or something along here.

13:43.561 --> 13:44.736
Hey, Rob?

13:44.780 --> 13:46.608
Yeah?

13:46.651 --> 13:48.566
SABRINA: I can't hear
with all that ruckus.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.526
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me demo quietly for you.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.876
[laughing]

13:53.920 --> 13:55.530
Nathan and I agree that having

13:55.573 --> 13:57.488
a mural would be perfect
for the space.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.925
So now I have to do
a little research to find

13:58.968 --> 14:00.883
a local artist to paint it.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.843
But first we have to get this
huge countertop out of here...

14:03.886 --> 14:05.757
One, two, three.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.239
...to have better access
to frame out the wall.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.981
It's day two of our renovation,

14:12.025 --> 14:14.157
and our crew has been
hard at work.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.116
In the lounge,
the drywall has been

14:16.159 --> 14:18.509
delivered,
set in place, and painted,

14:18.553 --> 14:20.337
and the baseboards
have been installed as well.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.905
So that means I have
a fresh palette to work with.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.299
But in even better news,
last night,

14:25.342 --> 14:28.389
I found the perfect local
artist to paint our mural.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
-Nathan. Hi.
-Hey.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.914
-I have such a great surprise.
-Yeah?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.177
Nathan Chen, meet Nate Pack.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.918
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Very nice to meet you.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.006
-Yeah, I'm Nathan.
-Nate is a muralist

14:37.050 --> 14:39.922
-here in Salt Lake City.
-Okay. Cool.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.011
And he has agreed to make
a mural out of the space

14:42.055 --> 14:43.795
-that we are now going to have.
-Oh, no way!

14:43.839 --> 14:45.797
-Oh, perfect. That's so cool.
-Yes.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.799
Pretend this isn't open.
This is gonna be a wall.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.758
-Okay.
-Right, okay. So we'll just work

14:49.801 --> 14:51.020
-in that space.
-Right.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.935
-Yeah.
-Yes, exactly. And I mean,

14:52.979 --> 14:54.806
this space here is
for figure skaters specifically.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.199
Anything that come... sort of,

14:56.243 --> 14:57.940
like, encompasses
figure skating.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.681
-Okay.
-A general figure skating thing

14:59.724 --> 15:01.161
would be ideal for this space.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.250
Take a look at the stuff
that he's done before.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.165
-All right.
-Super colorful, really graphic.
-Ooh.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.210
-NATHAN: Wow. Okay.
-NATE: Yeah. I use lots

15:07.254 --> 15:10.344
-of strong lines and colors,
kind of figures in motion
-Yeah.

15:10.387 --> 15:12.433
-...is what I'm thinking. Yeah?
-Yeah. Absolutely.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.695
NATHAN: I mean, that's perfect
for figure skating.

15:13.738 --> 15:14.783
-Oh, my gosh. So cool.
-Right?

15:14.826 --> 15:16.176
Nate's style was perfect

15:16.219 --> 15:17.438
for what we were trying
to accomplish,

15:17.481 --> 15:19.005
and the work that he'd

15:19.048 --> 15:20.397
previously done
was beautiful, and I knew

15:20.441 --> 15:21.268
that he was going
to do something very similar.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.965
Any color ideas?

15:23.009 --> 15:25.228
My favorite color is blue,
but beyond that, you know,

15:25.272 --> 15:27.013
whatever-whatever colors
you think would go well here.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.405
-I'll work on some drawings
and come back to you.
-All right.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.103
-Awesome.
-Okay. Good.
-See what you think?

15:30.146 --> 15:31.669
-I'll see you soon.
-Sounds-sounds good.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.062
-Yeah.
-You and I need to get to work.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.281
Thank you.
All right, Rob,

15:34.324 --> 15:36.631
we got a muralist
to work on this area.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.720
I'm going to get it
all studded up. We'll get

15:38.763 --> 15:40.026
some sheetrock on the outside.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.984
Because we're framing out
the new wall

15:42.028 --> 15:43.943
into the existing concrete,

15:43.986 --> 15:47.816
first we have to attach the base
track using a nail shotgun.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.949
[loud pop]

15:49.992 --> 15:51.994
-There you go. Let's go.
-Cool. Okay.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.517
We got a lot more to do here.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.650
-[pop]
-There you go.
-Wow.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.521
-[pop]
-There you go.
-Ooh, that has a kick.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.697
-It does. A little recoil.
-[Sabrina laughs]

15:59.741 --> 16:01.873
So, listen, we got
to do the top, also, and then,

16:01.917 --> 16:04.572
we got to get these studs
together and screw them in.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.966
[loud nail gun pops]

16:09.316 --> 16:12.232
This one here. Let's see
how we did measuring.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.976
-Looks good, yeah?
-Yeah.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.325
This'll be, like, a great space,

16:18.368 --> 16:21.023
because...
a lot of the locker rooms

16:21.067 --> 16:23.243
in this place are taken up
by the hockey players, right?

16:23.286 --> 16:25.027
-Yeah.
-So now the figure skaters

16:25.071 --> 16:26.550
will have their own place.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.074
-Exactly. Yup.
-Which is really cool.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.205
NATHAN:
This whole process
is super new to me.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.424
I've never done anything
in construction.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.816
I've never hung sheetrock.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.470
I actually didn't even know
what sheetrock was.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.646
I didn't realize it was the same
thing as drywall until today.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.300
-Let me finish
putting the screws in these.
-Sure.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.259
And, uh, you can measure
that last piece up to cut,

16:39.302 --> 16:40.825
-and we'll be good.
-Cool.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.044
It is definitely harder work
than I thought.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
NISCHELLE:
Yo!

16:43.915 --> 16:45.395
Oh, Nischelle!

16:45.439 --> 16:46.657
I literally have been
walking around this place

16:46.701 --> 16:48.616
-trying to find y'all.
-How are you doing?

16:48.659 --> 16:50.444
Hi, guys. What's up?
You're just pushing sheetrock?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.533
Yeah, well,
we've got work to do.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.014
-We have made so much progress.
-I mean... I know, I know.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.233
I was kind of peeking in,
looking at different stuff.

16:57.277 --> 17:00.062
-I'm excited. You feel good?
-Feeling great. Loving it.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.411
Okay, listen, got to take
my jean jacket brother...

17:01.455 --> 17:03.544
Yeah, I love it.
Did you guys call each other?

17:03.587 --> 17:05.111
-You know we do.
-ROB: you got something fun
planned?

17:05.154 --> 17:07.374
-Wonder Twin powers, activate!
-Yeah.

17:07.416 --> 17:09.028
NISCHELLE:
Today, Nathan and I are headed

17:09.070 --> 17:12.074
to visit his first skating
coach, Stephanee Grosscup.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.207
She's the one responsible
for Nathan falling in love

17:14.250 --> 17:16.686
with skating and is one
of the three coaches

17:16.731 --> 17:18.037
Nathan is surprising.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.994
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Won't keep away long, but

17:20.039 --> 17:21.127
-I'm excited about this.
-Have fun.
-All right.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.693
Come on, Sabrina.
Pick up the slack.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.565
You're driving, 'cause I don't
know where I'm going.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.740
-Yup. My car's out. Let's go.
-All right, cool. Bye, guys.

17:25.782 --> 17:26.784
-Bye, guys. Have fun!
-Bye-bye.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.222
NISCHELLE:
We are headed to Stephanee's.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.963
Yes. I haven't seen her
since... a year?

17:32.007 --> 17:34.009
-No? Maybe?
-So, she hasn't

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
seen you since your title became

17:35.880 --> 17:37.665
"gold-medal-winning skater."

17:37.708 --> 17:40.407
-NATHAN: No. Yeah. Basically.
-I love it. I love it.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.886
[knocking]

17:42.931 --> 17:44.585
-Ah!
-[laughter]

17:44.628 --> 17:46.500
[Stephanee laughs loudly]

17:46.543 --> 17:48.241
NATHAN:
Oh.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.764
-NISCHELLE: Aw.
-NATHAN: Oh, my God.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.679
Oh, Nathan.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.507
You haven't seen each other

17:53.550 --> 17:55.248
-since he won
the gold medal, right?
-Yeah, it's true.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.119
Yeah. Your dream!

17:57.163 --> 17:59.382
I remember thinking to myself
when he was little, if anyone

17:59.426 --> 18:02.820
could potentially win
an Olympic gold medal,

18:02.864 --> 18:05.171
of all the children that I have
taught ice skating to

18:05.214 --> 18:08.043
in my life, it's going
to be this little kid.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.132
-I made up a lot of stuff
to teach him.
-Yeah.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.048
I would draw, like,
a lake on the ice for him.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.137
And then,
we would get some speed up,

18:15.181 --> 18:17.139
-and he jumps a lake, right?
-Oh, yeah.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.142
-And then become a mushroom
and then a tree.
-So cute.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.926
I'm not getting out of here
until you show me

18:21.970 --> 18:24.320
how to be a mushroom.
I'm not kidding. Come on.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.714
-I don't even remember.
-Here we go.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.237
-We go like this. We do this.
-No, no, we're gonna
get a lesson.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.892
And then we'd go like this
all the way down.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.068
Be a mushroom,
and then we grow up

18:33.112 --> 18:35.853
-to be a tree.
-Oh!

18:35.897 --> 18:37.986
-That was awesome.
-That's the best.

18:38.029 --> 18:41.032
-Now, tell me that you have
some photos of him.
-Oh, yeah.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.861
I do. I do, I do, I do, I do.

18:43.905 --> 18:47.082
-Yeah, I put this video of you
on YouTube, Nathan.
-Oh, really?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.649
Yeah, it's had some...
like, 700,000 views.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.999
NATHAN: Oh, no way.
Oh, that's awesome.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.480
-NISCHELLE: Oh.
Oh, look at him!
-NATHAN: That's sweet.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.090
-Look at him.
-NATHAN:
Little white skates, too.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.439
STEPHANEE:
There's those white skates.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.398
This was, I think,
his first competition,

18:58.441 --> 19:01.531
and he was so little that he was
scoopable, you know?

19:01.575 --> 19:05.013
Like, they had put his results
up onto this board,

19:05.056 --> 19:07.407
and so I scooped him up and held
him in my arms and I was like,

19:07.450 --> 19:09.670
"Look, Nathan, you have first
all across the board."

19:09.713 --> 19:12.281
And he was like, "Hmm."

19:12.325 --> 19:14.805
-Do you remember that?
-Kind of. Actually, kind of.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.938
STEPHANEE:
I love this photo.
This was his... well,

19:16.981 --> 19:19.027
-the first interview
I ever saw him do.
-NATHAN: Yeah.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.290
NISCHELLE:
This is really a march
down memory lane.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.379
-NATHAN: Yeah.
-STEPHANEE: Yeah.
I remember sitting there,

19:23.423 --> 19:26.687
and I'm like, "Oh, my God, he's
going to make the Olympics."

19:26.730 --> 19:29.690
-And, um...
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Oh. This is...

19:29.733 --> 19:31.474
-It's so...
I'm just so proud of you.
-Yeah.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.998
-What a blessing
it's been for you to have...
-I know.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.783
-Absolutely.
-...her in your life.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.567
-I'm so lucky.
-And-and mine.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.569
-You're a total blessing
in my life.
-Thanks, Steph.

19:39.613 --> 19:42.833
When he won, like, any doubt
I ever had in my life

19:42.877 --> 19:45.358
of thinking, "Have I told
children the right thing?

19:45.401 --> 19:47.490
"Have I... have I been there
enough for them?

19:47.534 --> 19:50.189
Have I... have I given what
I have needed to give?"

19:50.232 --> 19:51.929
-NATHAN: Mm-hmm.
-When that all happened,

19:51.973 --> 19:53.235
something lined up
inside of me.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.150
TERRY GANNON:
The best skater in the world

19:55.194 --> 19:57.152
just brought it on
the biggest stage in the world.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.198
JOHNNY WEIR:
And this performance was

19:59.241 --> 20:01.939
the absolute best
of what Nathan Chen does.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.768
STEPHANEE:
And I said to myself,
"Oh, my gosh.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.162
I helped this kid."

20:07.206 --> 20:08.946
-Mm. That gives me goosebumps.
-Yes.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.340
-Thanks, Steph.
-Oh, yes, we are out here
affirming lives

20:11.384 --> 20:12.776
-and paying it forward.
-It's the truth, too.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.169
-I-I love this.
-Yeah.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.039
This renovation project
is so cool.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.563
It means so much to me.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.565
But what's even cooler is
to be able

20:18.608 --> 20:19.870
to have the opportunity
to honor Stephanee, who has been

20:19.914 --> 20:21.220
such an integral part
of my life.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.612
I really would like to stay.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.484
-You are amazing.
-Thank you.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.963
-But I got to steal him,
and I got to get him back.
-Okay.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.182
-But we're going
to see you again.
-Yup.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.575
NATHAN:
And I don't think Stephanee has

20:28.618 --> 20:29.706
any idea that this is going
to be in her honor,

20:29.750 --> 20:32.013
so I'm so excited
to surprise her.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.972
You clearly look like
you came prepared, so...

20:35.016 --> 20:37.453
-Yeah.
-I've been playing hockey
since I was a kid.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.543
NISCHELLE:
Rob and Nathan test
each other's skating skills.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.416
This is about the extent of it,
brother.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.418
NATHAN:
Ooh. I like it.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.247
NISCHELLE:
And later,
I learn where the DNA

20:48.290 --> 20:50.205
of an Olympic champion
comes from...

20:50.249 --> 20:51.380
NATHAN:
She would, like, bookmark

20:51.424 --> 20:52.599
every single exercise
that I had to do

20:52.642 --> 20:54.775
to show improvement
for the next time

20:54.818 --> 20:57.038
so we wouldn't have to go back
and revisit the same exercises.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.648
We could do something new
the next lesson.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.520
NISCHELLE: ...as I take a stroll
through the Utah mountains

21:00.563 --> 21:02.957
with another one
of Nathan's honorees,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.175
his mother, Hetty.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.525
I'm so proud of Nathan.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.397
No matter how famous
that he is, he...

21:08.441 --> 21:10.138
Nathan is still my baby.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.494
NISCHELLE: Nathan Chen has
invited the community

21:18.538 --> 21:21.628
to a ceremony and dedication
at the sports complex

21:21.671 --> 21:23.369
where he's working
on a renovation

21:23.412 --> 21:26.502
to say "thank you"
for all their support.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.809
His mother and three coaches
are coming to town

21:28.852 --> 21:30.463
to see what Nathan has done.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.552
But in an emotional surprise,

21:32.595 --> 21:35.946
they'll learn just how much
Nathan credits them

21:35.990 --> 21:39.776
with his success
on and off the ice.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.039
ROB:
We've been super busy
the last few days.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.825
Nathan's plan
to take a concession stand

21:44.868 --> 21:47.567
and completely transform it

21:47.610 --> 21:50.657
into a staging area for figure
skaters and dressing rooms

21:50.700 --> 21:55.009
has turned out to be
a much bigger job for my guys.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.491
We added all new walls,
electrical and plumbing.

21:58.534 --> 22:01.581
We built new booths
in the changing room.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.758
And even Nate the muralist
was super busy.

22:04.801 --> 22:07.413
He completed the entire mural
in just a couple of days.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.762
-ROB: Look at that.
-NATHAN: That's amazing.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.241
SABRINA:
That looks awesome.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.548
I like that he did the blue
and everything.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.028
-That was for you.
-Yeah. He did that for me.
That's amazing.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.377
Yeah, we got to do something
around it, right?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.074
-Yeah. Looks a little like...
-Well, you know,

22:17.118 --> 22:18.859
we're doing that black stripe
in the lounge.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.991
What if we paint these black,

22:21.035 --> 22:22.950
and then do some sort
of frame around?

22:22.993 --> 22:24.865
-Do you have time for that?
-Yeah, I think we could do that.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.997
SABRINA:
I think that adding
that bit of frame

22:27.041 --> 22:29.522
will really make the mural pop.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.611
Rob and his team really have
a lot of work to do,

22:31.654 --> 22:33.961
but I don't really think it's
going to take a lot of time.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.615
The staging room
for the figure skaters

22:35.658 --> 22:37.399
is really coming along.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.836
We're laying down rubber floors
just like

22:39.880 --> 22:41.142
in the ice hockey locker room.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.405
Oh, this looks great.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.580
SABRINA:
But that's the only thing
that's the same,

22:44.624 --> 22:46.060
because this space
is going to feel

22:46.103 --> 22:47.670
more like a trendy spa

22:47.714 --> 22:49.193
with contrasting paint colors

22:49.237 --> 22:50.238
and beautiful mirrors
and lighting

22:50.281 --> 22:52.762
that we're going to install.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.547
For sure.

22:54.590 --> 22:57.376
This is exactly what I think
this rink needed.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.247
It's really great to be able
to have this room,

22:59.290 --> 23:00.770
and I think that it's really
important to the skaters

23:00.814 --> 23:02.685
to have for practices
because it's a great place

23:02.729 --> 23:04.383
to sort of decompress off the
ice, but also for competitions.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.428
There's a lot
of competitions held here.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.430
Skating can get really stressful
sometimes, so having

23:08.474 --> 23:10.084
a room like that
is-is really relaxing.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.302
-I want to put this mirror up.
-Okay.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.348
And I am going to need a hand.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.437
All you have to do is slide
the bottom into the channel

23:15.481 --> 23:16.960
and then slowly push it
from the bottom up.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.397
-Okay.
-Okay? Center it.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.789
And don't get the glue
on your hands.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.443
It smells really strong.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.966
ROB:
Slowly.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.446
-Huh? Okay. Okay.
-ROB: Okay.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.535
-Now straight up. Straight up.
-Okay. Wait.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.102
-And it's going to hold it?
-Straight up. Straight up.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.408
-It's gonna hold it?
-Straight up. Straight.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.497
Is it in the middle?
It's not in the middle.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.846
-Well, before you push it,
come over a little.
-Okay.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.151
Right there. Right there,
right there.

23:34.195 --> 23:35.457
-Is it good?
-Okay. Right to it.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.111
Don't we have to stand there
until it dries?

23:37.154 --> 23:38.634
That's it.
This'll bond almost immediately.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
-Well...
-Are you sure?
-Stop-stop looking at yourself

23:40.941 --> 23:42.595
-in the mirror, Sabrina.
-[laughter]

23:42.638 --> 23:44.423
-It looks good.
-I'll just stay here
until it dries.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.250
-Okay.
-Seriously, that looks great.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.469
-Have a good afternoon.
-All right.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.079
Nathan, let's go get lunch,
brother.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.211
[laughing]:
All right. Sounds good.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.778
SARINA:
I mean, I'm not going to let go.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.259
ROB:
After Nathan and I grabbed
a quick lunch,

23:55.303 --> 23:56.478
we were right back to work...

23:56.522 --> 23:57.958
What do you think, Nathan?

23:58.001 --> 23:59.002
Looking pretty good
in here, huh?

23:59.046 --> 24:00.264
...finishing up the booths

24:00.308 --> 24:02.484
in the figure skaters'
new changing room.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.095
To think that this was
an old concession stand

24:05.139 --> 24:07.576
boggles my mind because it looks

24:07.620 --> 24:08.838
so different now.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.492
I can't imagine what Stephanee

24:10.536 --> 24:12.059
and the other coaches
are going to think

24:12.102 --> 24:14.409
when they see this next week.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.716
Right side in and pull
the outside out so that it fits.

24:16.759 --> 24:20.371
Not only can we see his amazing
work ethic, but I can tell

24:20.415 --> 24:22.591
how much this renovation means
to him.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.419
We're going to do a walk-through
so they're going to be able

24:24.463 --> 24:26.595
to see all of this, but, uh,
they're not going to know

24:26.639 --> 24:28.597
actually that we're doing this
all in their honor.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.120
They're going
to be surprised, for sure.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.079
-That's the goal.
-I can't wait.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.429
-Yup.
-All right. Well, uh,
everything here looks good.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.213
We got a little bit of time.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.737
-For sure.
-It would be a huge treat for me

24:37.780 --> 24:39.303
if I got to ice skate...

24:39.347 --> 24:40.609
-Sure.
-...with an Olympic champion.

24:40.653 --> 24:41.871
-Awesome.
-What do you say we hit the ice

24:41.915 --> 24:43.046
-for a little bit?
-Sounds great.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.265
That's my place, so let's go.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.875
I've spent my whole entire life

24:45.919 --> 24:47.529
on the ice, so anytime
that I can find a person

24:47.573 --> 24:49.444
that shares a passion
to the ice,

24:49.488 --> 24:50.663
immediately,
I can bond with them.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.839
So, Rob,

24:52.882 --> 24:55.015
you clearly look like
you came prepared, so, yeah.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.843
-I've been playing hockey
since I was a kid.
-Okay, cool.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.106
And, uh, it's been a while
since I've been out there.

24:59.149 --> 25:01.674
-Yeah.
-But what do you say
we see if we still got it?

25:01.717 --> 25:02.588
Absolutely.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.118
Nice.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.383
Scores.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.516
Yes.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.998
NATHAN:
You got a good shot, man.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.043
ROB:
It was awesome

25:23.086 --> 25:24.958
to play ice hockey with Nathan,

25:25.001 --> 25:28.309
but what I really wanted to see
was his figure skating up close.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.745
But he wouldn't do anything

25:29.789 --> 25:31.747
until I showed him
my skills first.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.228
This is about the extent
of it, brother.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.577
NATHAN:
Ooh. I like it.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.274
He does it better than I do it.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.667
Rob did a pretty good spiral
out there.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.973
He lifted his leg.
It was pretty high.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.801
It's probably higher
than my leg can go, so,

25:41.844 --> 25:43.629
I'd say he's-he's a pretty good
figure skater.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.544
♪

25:52.986 --> 25:54.727
ROB:
Oh, ho, ho!

25:54.770 --> 25:56.598
-That's so sick, dude.
-[laughs]

25:56.642 --> 25:58.600
-Uh, you try to go.
-Are you kidding me?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.341
-You try that.
-Are you kidding me?!

26:00.384 --> 26:02.256
Thanks for having me out,
brother.

26:02.299 --> 26:03.823
Of course. Yeah.
Thanks for coming out.

26:03.866 --> 26:05.564
-Yeah, it was fun.
-It was great. Yeah, absolutely.

26:10.351 --> 26:13.006
NISCHELLE:
We've made it to day nine
on our renovation,

26:13.049 --> 26:15.965
and the crew's continuing
their work on the dressing room.

26:16.009 --> 26:19.186
So Rob has given Nathan
a work pass for the day.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.667
I've heard so much
about Nathan's mom, Hetty,

26:21.710 --> 26:24.234
and how influential
she was in his career.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.975
But Hetty has no idea

26:26.019 --> 26:28.587
that Nathan is doing
this renovation in her honor.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.241
Nathan invited me to join them

26:31.285 --> 26:32.634
on one of their regular hikes

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
through the beautiful
Utah mountains,

26:34.680 --> 26:37.639
and I am just dying to meet her.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.467
Hello.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.208
I told him,
"I have got to meet your mom."

26:41.251 --> 26:43.993
-I've heard so much about you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.691
And he said that your family
used to go on hikes

26:45.734 --> 26:47.214
-on this trail a lot.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

26:47.257 --> 26:48.476
-So he asked me
to join you guys today.
-Cool.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.304
NISCHELLE:
We were talking before--

26:50.347 --> 26:52.698
Nathan and I-- about the fact

26:52.741 --> 26:54.961
that you and his father
were immigrants here.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.093
And I know that you immersed
yourselves into the culture.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.268
-You learned to speak English...
-Yeah.

26:58.312 --> 27:00.662
...by helping in his classes,
correct?

27:00.706 --> 27:05.188
They asked every student's
parent to, you know, come, uh,

27:05.232 --> 27:07.234
-volunteer to help the class.
-Mm-hmm.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.236
I used that opportunity
to learn,

27:09.279 --> 27:10.977
you know, to learn English.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.935
NATHAN:
Both of my parents came
from China.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.111
My dad came in for university
for education in the U.S.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.896
And my mom sort of
did everything

27:16.939 --> 27:18.245
that she could to help him.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.681
Obviously,
finances were difficult.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.770
They had five kids,
myself included,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.642
um, and did everything
that they could in their power

27:23.685 --> 27:25.382
to sort of give us all
opportunities that we wanted,

27:25.426 --> 27:27.515
and never really let finance
be a hurdle, um,

27:27.558 --> 27:29.256
to prevent us from any goals
or dreams that we had.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.519
HETTY:
Once you started skating,

27:31.562 --> 27:33.782
I just feel like,
oh, maybe, uh,

27:33.826 --> 27:35.958
-gymnastics will help.
-Mm-hmm.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.699
-Dance will help.
-Yeah.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.875
And, you know, music will help,
like, hockey will help.

27:39.919 --> 27:43.749
But that's so smart of you
to just realize that early on,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.273
that all those other things
would actually really aid him

27:46.316 --> 27:47.709
-in skating.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.450
-You know what I'm saying?
-Right. Mm-hmm.

27:49.493 --> 27:50.973
So many people have said
you were there with him,

27:51.017 --> 27:52.714
-like, every single day.
-Yeah.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.021
-Taking notes, taking lessons,
because...
-Yeah.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.240
...like, the family couldn't
afford all the private lessons.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.765
-So you kind of stepped in
as de facto coach.
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.723
She would, like, bookmark every
single exercise that I had to do

28:01.767 --> 28:03.812
to show improvement
for the next time

28:03.856 --> 28:05.596
so we wouldn't have to go back
and revisit the same exercises.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.729
We could do something new
the next lesson.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.340
Without that structure and
that sort of positive support,

28:10.384 --> 28:12.125
it would have been impossible
for me to,

28:12.168 --> 28:13.735
you know, see the improvement.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.912
I absolutely feel blessed
to have my mom as my mom.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.653
You know, I wouldn't

28:18.697 --> 28:20.611
have been able
to achieve anything without her.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.744
So, you know, it's definitely,
uh, all thanks to her.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.877
Did you become
a pretty good skater yourself?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.226
No, I only can skate.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.923
I cannot even do a crossover.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.185
She's a pretty good...
she's a pretty good skater.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.970
His goals--
improve my goals and not fall.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.102
-Right, that's mine, too.
-Yeah. Yeah.

28:34.538 --> 28:37.411
-NISCHELLE: Look at this view.
-NATHAN: Yeah.
-HETTY: Yeah.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.847
-So nice. Yes.
-Look at this view.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.327
-HETTY: So nice.
-NISCHELLE: I'm dumbfounded

28:40.370 --> 28:42.721
how beautiful this is.
Out there somewhere

28:42.764 --> 28:45.114
could be the next
little Nathan Chen

28:45.158 --> 28:48.074
-watching, waiting, hoping...
-Yeah. Yeah.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.424
...to have
that same opportunity.

28:50.467 --> 28:54.123
You're making that kid's journey

28:54.167 --> 28:56.038
a little bit easier,

28:56.082 --> 28:59.215
-a little bit nicer
by giving back.
-Yeah.

28:59.259 --> 29:01.087
HETTY:
I'm so proud of Nathan.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.742
No matter
how famous he is, he...

29:03.785 --> 29:05.874
Nathan is still my baby.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.575
NISCHELLE: Coming up,
the final pieces

29:11.619 --> 29:13.969
to the puzzle are going in.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.406
-Stuff's in?
-Yeah, so, where
would you like us to put it?

29:16.450 --> 29:19.061
NISCHELLE:
And the team
is ready to go live.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.150
-ROB: That's good.
Now angle it down.
-How about that?

29:21.194 --> 29:22.282
-That's awesome.
-That's awesome, dude.

29:22.325 --> 29:23.979
NISCHELLE:
Plus, Nathan's mom

29:24.023 --> 29:25.764
and his three former coaches

29:25.807 --> 29:27.156
are excited
to see what he's been doing

29:27.200 --> 29:28.157
at the sports complex...

29:28.201 --> 29:30.507
I cannot believe this.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.466
NISCHELLE:
...but are about to be surprised

29:32.509 --> 29:34.163
with Nathan's
special announcement.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.078
This is a small token
of appreciation.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.428
[applause and cheering]

29:44.565 --> 29:45.827
NISCHELLE: Nathan
and the team

29:45.871 --> 29:47.307
have been busy working
these past two weeks

29:47.350 --> 29:48.525
here at the Salt Lake City

29:48.569 --> 29:50.614
Sports Complex,
and the open house

29:50.658 --> 29:52.529
and dedication ceremony
are only

29:52.573 --> 29:53.661
a day away.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.358
What was a concession stand

29:55.402 --> 29:57.143
less than two weeks ago
is starting

29:57.186 --> 29:58.753
to look more like a staging area

29:58.797 --> 30:02.104
as the sink, cabinets and
lockers are making their way in.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.279
-Awesome.
-When we set this down,

30:03.323 --> 30:05.107
-just set it on the front...
-Okay.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.893
-...and slowly lean it back.
Okay.
-Okay. Whoa.

30:07.936 --> 30:09.285
-I'll tell you what, though.
-Yeah, we can make it more.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.113
This is going
to be a game changer.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.898
NATHAN:
Yeah, for sure, this is...
this is great.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.377
ROB: 'Cause, I mean, it's so
cold out there in that rink that

30:14.421 --> 30:15.509
all the moms are going
to want a cup of coffee.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.032
Yeah. Exactly.

30:17.076 --> 30:19.339
My mom and I spent hours
at this rink, so she definitely

30:19.382 --> 30:20.993
could have used a cup of coffee
every now and then.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.910
What do you think
about right up here?

30:24.953 --> 30:26.607
That works. I mean,
it's got a good angle, so...

30:26.650 --> 30:28.652
I love the concept
of being able to stream

30:28.696 --> 30:30.741
what's happening on the ice
into the lounge so that

30:30.785 --> 30:32.613
while parents are in
the lounge relaxing, they can

30:32.656 --> 30:34.441
also keep an eye on
what's happening on the ice.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.356
Go ahead. You get up there.
Put it up there.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.880
We'll check it out.
Aim it towards the rink.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.796
NATHAN:
Parents have a baby monitor, but
we're having a skating monitor.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.754
-Oh, nice. That's super easy.
-That's good.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.932
-Now angle it down.
-Yep. How about that?

30:46.975 --> 30:49.195
-You think that's good?
-That looks good. Let's go

30:49.238 --> 30:50.936
down to the lounge
and see if it came on.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.852
All right. Perfect. It's
like a parent POV right there.

30:53.895 --> 30:54.940
ROB:
Let's see if it works.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.291
There it is.

30:58.334 --> 30:59.118
-Let's go. That's awesome.
-Nice, dude.

30:59.161 --> 31:00.597
-Let's go.
-Beautiful.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.817
Beautiful. I like...
The angle's perfect.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.905
-ROB: You can see
the whole rink.
-Yeah, this is amazing.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.037
ROB:
And now the parents can sit here

31:05.080 --> 31:06.342
in the comfort of
this new lounge...

31:06.386 --> 31:08.127
-Relax, lounge...
-...and watch their kids.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.390
-Yeah, absolutely.
-That's awesome.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.347
That was the easiest thing
we've done so far.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.871
NATHAN:
[chuckles] Exactly.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.742
♪

31:19.660 --> 31:21.575
ROB: All right.
Careful on the edge.

31:21.618 --> 31:22.924
NISCHELLE:
You go first.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.796
-In the middle.
-It's Reveal Day, y'all.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.365
It's like... I get giddy on
Reveal Day. It's so gorgeous

31:29.409 --> 31:31.628
-and glamorous in here.
-It's coming together for sure.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.804
When I think of ice skating,
I think glam.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.589
-Yeah.
-Right?
-Yes.

31:35.632 --> 31:36.764
This is not like a hockey
locker, that's for sure.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.201
They love the rhinestones,
the sparkle.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.073
NATHAN:
It is a bit bittersweet to be
here at the end of the journey.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.205
This means so much to me to
be back here at Salt Lake City

31:43.249 --> 31:44.859
and doing this project,
and the process of

31:44.903 --> 31:46.426
doing it was so much fun.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.993
It feels so great
to be at this stage,

31:48.036 --> 31:49.733
being able to sort of see
the fruits of our labor

31:49.777 --> 31:51.518
and just see
how much work this team has

31:51.561 --> 31:53.955
put in and how great
everything has been turning out.

31:53.999 --> 31:54.913
-NISCHELLE: Is this supposed
to be you?
-No, it's not supposed to be me.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.306
Yeah, that's me. Then that's me.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.700
Oh, boy.
No, you'd be like this.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.049
[laughter]

32:02.094 --> 32:04.835
SABRINA:
This renovation is the most
drastic one I have ever done.

32:04.879 --> 32:07.273
I can't wait to see everyone's
face when they walk in.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.276
-All right, parents' lounge...
-Oh, thank you, dear.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.105
-Parents' and siblings' lounge.
-This is so cool.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.716
Nathan, what would Hetty have
thought of this back in the day?

32:15.759 --> 32:17.065
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.067
When she was on the ice
with you every day.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.895
Oh, man. No, I'm kidding.
She would have loved it.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.942
-Yeah.
-I'm so excited
to show my parents,

32:23.985 --> 32:27.162
the people in my life,
like my coaches, and

32:27.206 --> 32:28.816
the Salt Lake community
this renovation that we've done.

32:28.859 --> 32:31.732
And we got
the skates signed by the man.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.299
-SABRINA: Yes.
-NISCHELLE: There we go.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.953
Almost time for the tour.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.432
Oh. That's right, because
we got dignitaries coming.

32:36.476 --> 32:37.912
-We got to bring it in, right?
-All right, we gotta go.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.348
Bring it in, here we go.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.176
-One, two, three...
-ALL: Team.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.136
-All right.
-Let's do it.
-Go, go, go.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.138
NISCHELLE:
Our four honorees are arriving,

32:46.181 --> 32:47.704
and the mayor has shown up

32:47.748 --> 32:49.750
to thank Nathan and to check out

32:49.793 --> 32:51.056
what he's giving
to the community.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.971
JENNY WILSON:
The community is proud of you.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.581
Salt Lake County is proud
of you. Salt Lake City.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.583
All of us.
This is an amazing facility,

32:56.626 --> 32:58.759
and I'm so excited
to see the improvement.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.022
Oh, yeah, I'm so grateful
for, obviously the support

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
of the community of all
of you all, and then also

33:03.068 --> 33:05.026
just graciously
lending us a space to do

33:05.070 --> 33:07.028
all this, you know?
I'm really happy to be here.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.987
I'm so happy that I had
the opportunity to do all this

33:09.030 --> 33:10.597
and, yeah, just really
thankful for everything.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.555
NISCHELLE: The transformation
they've done with this space...

33:12.599 --> 33:14.253
You are going to lose your mind.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.168
It's so, so good.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.213
-It definitely looks different.
-[laughter]

33:18.257 --> 33:20.215
NISCHELLE:
Hi, guys.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.783
[laughs] Come on in.

33:22.826 --> 33:25.046
Hello, Miss Hetty. How are you?

33:25.090 --> 33:26.569
Oh, this is great.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.006
What's up, guys?
So good to see you again.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.355
Good to see you.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.183
Oh, my gosh. Yay!

33:31.226 --> 33:33.011
NATHAN: Since I was a little
kid, I was always trying

33:33.054 --> 33:34.403
to impress my coaches,
of course, to some degree.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.710
NISCHELLE: We're all here
to go check this out.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.365
NATHAN: So it's kind of funny
to go back into being here

33:39.408 --> 33:40.583
in Salt Lake City
and having that same

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
feeling of wanting to hopefully

33:42.107 --> 33:43.717
impress them with the work
that we did here.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.153
Oh, my gosh.
This is so exciting.

33:45.197 --> 33:46.589
All right, so here we are.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.548
-Figure skater lounge.
-Wow!

33:48.591 --> 33:50.985
Welcome to the parents' lounge.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.161
Wow.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.989
STEPHANEE:
Oh...

33:55.033 --> 33:57.426
my...

33:57.470 --> 33:59.907
NISCHELLE:
All right, take all in.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.735
STEPHANEE:
This is so beautiful.

34:05.260 --> 34:06.522
Oh, my gosh,
this is so exciting.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.610
All right, here we are.
Figure skater lounge.

34:08.655 --> 34:12.179
-Wow.
-Welcome to the parents' lounge.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.748
Oh... my...

34:14.791 --> 34:17.838
Oh, my God.
This is so beautiful.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.755
NISCHELLE:
Take it all in. Take it all in.

34:21.797 --> 34:24.062
There's so much
to see in this room.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.629
I know there's a lot to take in.
It's completely different.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.456
-his was the pro shop.
-Wow.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.590
STEPHANEE:
Amazing.

34:30.632 --> 34:33.158
Wow, look at the screen. How you
can see the ice right there.

34:33.201 --> 34:36.248
NISCHELLE: You always said
your mom was always here,

34:36.291 --> 34:38.598
out on the ice, cold.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.208
And so we thought, why not make

34:40.252 --> 34:42.645
a space for them
where they feel comfortable?

34:42.688 --> 34:44.212
My siblings would spend so much
time here at the rink, but not

34:44.255 --> 34:46.606
really ever have
a designated place to work,

34:46.649 --> 34:48.303
so it's like
a little homework table.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.478
NISCHELLE: Well, this is
just the beginning.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.739
-We have a lot more to see.
-Oh, boy.

34:50.784 --> 34:51.741
And the fact

34:51.784 --> 34:52.960
that it's so bright

34:53.003 --> 34:54.440
and it's so beautiful.

34:54.483 --> 34:56.790
It's almost a little bit
too mind-boggling because

34:56.833 --> 34:59.140
you don't really see places
like this in ice rinks.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.620
I mean,
this is an ice rink, right?

35:00.663 --> 35:02.448
-Wow.
-All right, follow me.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.754
I can see
that nice nap space, too.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.148
NATHAN: There's something
really cool that I want

35:07.192 --> 35:09.063
-to show you while
actually over here, so...
-All righty.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.847
This used, of course,
you all know that this used

35:10.891 --> 35:13.111
to be the concession stand
and it used to have

35:13.154 --> 35:15.635
the big gate,
so we took that all out and...

35:15.678 --> 35:17.245
-Oh, look at that artwork!
-That's so cool!

35:17.289 --> 35:20.640
NATHAN:
There's a local muralist,
Nate Pack, who donated

35:20.683 --> 35:22.642
his time and did
an amazing job, so...

35:22.685 --> 35:25.514
-Nathan swears that's not him.
-That's not me, that's not me.

35:25.558 --> 35:28.169
NISCHELLE:
But I think that we're gonna say
it's him.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.867
JENNY:
Well, this is amazing.
It's beautiful.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.479
So to see the group come in
and do this and Nathan

35:33.522 --> 35:35.220
be a part of it is amazing

35:35.263 --> 35:37.439
to us and I'm really excited
to be here today.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.704
NISCHELLE:
Welcome to the new figure
skater changing room.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.489
Wow.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.926
STEPHANEE [laughing]:
No way!

35:45.969 --> 35:48.494
This is so...

35:48.537 --> 35:50.278
-It's amazing.
-...awesome.

35:51.758 --> 35:55.718
KAREL: Most of the rinks don't
have good rooms to change in.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.243
People have to change
in the, in the hallway.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.070
I think
it's extremely thoughtful

36:00.114 --> 36:01.768
that he thought about that,

36:01.811 --> 36:05.685
uh, doing this for the facility
and for the people of...

36:05.728 --> 36:07.513
that love figure skating,
period.

36:07.556 --> 36:10.168
Changed it up a lot, right?

36:10.211 --> 36:13.519
Oh, you are so fantastic.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.129
We're gonna be
so grateful for it

36:15.173 --> 36:16.913
for the rest
of our teaching lives here.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.176
[laughs]

36:18.219 --> 36:19.786
Look at this.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.354
No way!

36:22.397 --> 36:24.225
NISCHELLE:
I have to tell you guys,

36:24.269 --> 36:25.922
-this was
a lot of Nathan's design.
-Yeah, they were saying

36:25.966 --> 36:27.794
to put everything on
the front one, but I was like,

36:27.837 --> 36:29.187
it kind of makes more sense
to put in the back.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.797
NISCHELLE:
This is really his brainchild.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.103
-These, these areas.
-This is incredible.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.715
Yeah, like,
this was a concession stand.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.151
Used to be the big
refrigerators were back here.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.761
You know? So good.

36:38.805 --> 36:40.198
STEPHANEE:
It's bright.

36:40.241 --> 36:41.242
It's beautiful.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.678
It's so well done.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.594
We really leaned
on Nathan to tell us

36:45.638 --> 36:47.335
-what would work in this room...
-Yes.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.163
...what the skaters need.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.687
STEPHANEE:
It's like you could
almost, you know,

36:51.731 --> 36:54.168
graze your hand across the wall

36:54.212 --> 36:57.258
and you go, "Oh, my gosh,
we have a little bit of Nathan."

36:57.302 --> 37:00.000
Just fantastic. I mean,
every detail in here is just

37:00.043 --> 37:02.132
going to serve
a different purpose

37:02.176 --> 37:05.397
for some different event
that we'll have going on here,

37:05.440 --> 37:07.225
which is so incredible.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.052
I used to remember, I used
to change in the little, uh,

37:09.096 --> 37:11.403
unisex bathroom over there,
so it's cool to have, like,

37:11.446 --> 37:12.926
the little, like,
the little stalls now,

37:12.969 --> 37:14.710
close stuff up, yeah.
I remember I was,

37:14.754 --> 37:16.538
I was there
with my mom and, like,

37:16.582 --> 37:18.540
she would help me change and,
like, fall off the little chair.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.369
'Cause she's small, it was,
like, always, like, such a mess.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.153
-The look on your faces.
-I know.

37:23.197 --> 37:24.938
It's everything.

37:24.981 --> 37:28.289
Today Nathan Chen came
into this building

37:28.333 --> 37:30.160
and he gave back

37:30.204 --> 37:31.988
all the love that...

37:32.032 --> 37:34.426
we gave to him when he was
a kid and then some.

37:34.469 --> 37:37.646
-It's so cool.
-Yeah.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.780
STEPHANIE: Anyone that grew up
at Steiner knows Nathan Chen.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.390
We all got to watch this
beautiful young man develop

37:42.434 --> 37:45.175
this talent and then to see
him share it with everyone else,

37:45.219 --> 37:47.439
it's just kind of a great
inspiration for all of us.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.355
-This is looking beautiful.
-To walk into this room and see

37:50.398 --> 37:53.619
the light and the energy
and to see the beauty

37:53.662 --> 37:55.490
in here,
it's just exciting to think

37:55.534 --> 37:57.318
that there's a place like
this where we feel comfortable

37:57.362 --> 37:58.537
and where we can be together.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.279
Hot chocolate?!

38:01.322 --> 38:03.324
Geniya, Stephanee, Karel and my
mom are loving the renovation,

38:03.368 --> 38:06.371
but they have no idea that I
have one more surprise coming.

38:06.414 --> 38:10.679
Let's give it up, though, guys,
for Nathan Chen!

38:10.723 --> 38:13.291
[cheering, applause]

38:17.033 --> 38:20.080
I know how much
this community means to you.

38:20.123 --> 38:23.083
While he loves all of
Salt Lake City, there are some

38:23.126 --> 38:24.824
people here that have
really been instrumental

38:24.867 --> 38:26.913
in your journey.
We do want to recognize

38:26.956 --> 38:29.045
those people tonight, too.
So his mother,

38:29.089 --> 38:31.613
who I have just fallen
head over heels from,

38:31.657 --> 38:33.398
Ms. Hetty Wong,
she is here tonight.

38:33.441 --> 38:37.271
Stephanee Grosscup,
which is his very first teacher.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.666
Karel Kovar, another one of
his childhood skate instructors.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.277
And Evgeniya Chernyshova, also

38:43.321 --> 38:45.323
one of Nathan's skating coaches.

38:45.366 --> 38:46.846
Come on out here.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.414
You guys have been
so instrumental to him.

38:49.457 --> 38:52.591
And I told you this is gonna be
a special night, right?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.506
So now I just want to turn this

38:54.549 --> 38:55.811
microphone over to Nathan.
You ready?

38:55.855 --> 38:57.422
-Absolutely.
-There you go.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.989
-So, Nischelle,
before you leave?
-Oh. Uh-huh?

39:00.033 --> 39:02.122
A couple of weeks back when
we first met, you said that

39:02.165 --> 39:03.776
-you'd never seen
an Olympic medal.
-[gasps]

39:03.819 --> 39:05.038
And you're gonna get
a kick out of this

39:05.081 --> 39:07.127
because how we transport it
is in a sock.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.607
-Oh, my God!
-To protect the medal.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.870
[squeals]
This is so cool!

39:10.913 --> 39:14.439
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

39:23.578 --> 39:25.841
NATHAN:
So, Nischelle, before you leave?

39:25.885 --> 39:27.974
-NISCHELLE: Uh-huh?
-A couple of weeks back
when we first met,

39:28.017 --> 39:29.628
you said that you'd never seen
an Olympic medal.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.499
-[Nischelle gasps]
-[Nathan laughs]

39:31.543 --> 39:32.718
[squeals]
This is so cool!

39:32.761 --> 39:34.589
You don't understand
how geeked I am.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.113
This was the one thing-- oh,

39:37.157 --> 39:39.377
my gosh, look at this.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.291
[cheering, applause]

39:41.335 --> 39:43.119
Look...

39:43.163 --> 39:45.252
You guys!

39:45.295 --> 39:47.602
This is his gold medal.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.125
[cheering, applause]

39:49.169 --> 39:50.866
Oh, my gosh.

39:50.910 --> 39:51.824
-You can pass it down.
-You guys...

39:51.867 --> 39:53.956
[laughing]:
No way.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.654
NISCHELLE:
Isn't that cool?

39:55.697 --> 39:57.264
STEPHANEE:
When he let us hold it,

39:57.307 --> 39:59.266
I, for a second, went,

39:59.309 --> 40:02.051
"This is my gold medal
of my life right here."

40:02.095 --> 40:05.794
And it made me feel
so special and so

40:05.838 --> 40:08.884
a part of everything
that has happened to him.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.757
I'm so honored to have
this opportunity to do something

40:11.800 --> 40:13.541
just tiny back
for the Salt Lake community.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.456
But, overall, I'm just so
grateful for all the support

40:15.500 --> 40:17.676
that you have all given me
over my many years

40:17.719 --> 40:19.373
here in Salt Lake City.
And of course,

40:19.417 --> 40:20.940
these four people up here are
so special to me

40:20.983 --> 40:22.768
and my time here in Salt Lake.

40:22.811 --> 40:25.684
So as one last,
final bit of surprise,

40:25.727 --> 40:27.947
the renovation that we
did here has just been

40:27.990 --> 40:30.210
one of the most amazing
experiences of my life.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.517
And I want to honor these four
people up here for everything

40:32.560 --> 40:36.172
that they had done for me.
And so this plaque here is

40:36.216 --> 40:38.523
to honor the four of them
for all of their help.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.133
And so, really, this is just,

40:40.176 --> 40:42.135
this is a small token
of appreciation.

40:42.178 --> 40:44.442
[cheering, applause]

40:46.748 --> 40:49.838
It's really just
for all the amazing things

40:49.882 --> 40:51.623
that you've done for me,
the Salt Lake community,

40:51.666 --> 40:53.320
for the sport of figure skating,

40:53.363 --> 40:55.061
um, there's so much that,
you know, we're all in debt

40:55.104 --> 40:57.237
to you, and this is just a small
little token appreciation.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.587
So I hope that you
enjoy the honor of that.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.763
-And thank you all so much.
-STEPHANEE: Oh,
this is so sweet.

41:01.807 --> 41:05.463
This is,
this is so unbelievable!

41:05.506 --> 41:07.508
Thank you, Nathan.

41:07.552 --> 41:10.555
NATHAN:
It's absolutely surreal to be
able to explore the journey

41:10.598 --> 41:13.514
that I've been on with,
uh, my past three coaches,

41:13.558 --> 41:15.690
and, of course, my mom.
Just very important

41:15.734 --> 41:18.040
to recognize all that support
and love and help.

41:18.084 --> 41:19.781
In some ways, try to do the best

41:19.825 --> 41:22.131
to give back in
whatever capacity that you can.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.393
And I hope
that this is just a small,

41:23.437 --> 41:25.091
little token of appreciation
to, you know,

41:25.134 --> 41:26.875
all the support that I received.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.964
-That is
the sweetest thing ever.
-Thanks for being a part of it.

41:29.008 --> 41:32.359
For him to take some time
and come back to his hometown

41:32.402 --> 41:34.796
and do something
for the skating community,

41:34.840 --> 41:39.366
to just leave a part of him here
for everyone to...

41:39.409 --> 41:42.195
be inspired,
why, I think it's very special.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.588
Thanks for being
a part of our lives.

41:43.631 --> 41:46.155
Oh, my gosh,
thanks for being a part of mine.

41:46.199 --> 41:47.722
-All right, I love you.
-Oh, love you all, too.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.202
KAREL:
Means a lot.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.683
I teared up immediately.

41:51.726 --> 41:54.076
I got really emotional, and...

41:54.120 --> 41:55.513
I'll never forget this moment.

41:55.556 --> 41:59.429
And, you know,
he is an Olympic gold medalist,

41:59.473 --> 42:04.173
but he is also a man
who just simply loves to skate.

42:04.217 --> 42:07.089
So I can't think of
a better way to close this out

42:07.133 --> 42:10.440
than to invite
the community of Salt Lake

42:10.484 --> 42:13.835
to fellowship on the ice
with Nathan Chen.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.577
So I would say,
who's got their skates today?

42:16.621 --> 42:18.579
[cheering, applause]

42:18.623 --> 42:20.929
[skaters clamoring]

42:23.628 --> 42:25.412
It feels amazing to give back
to the Sports Complex.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.545
You know,
I spent so much of my life here.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.548
WOMAN:
All right, look at me, smile!

42:30.591 --> 42:32.550
So it's really cool
to be able to now, one,

42:32.593 --> 42:34.334
have a little bit
of my own self in the rink.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.901
And then also to just, you know,

42:35.944 --> 42:37.946
give back to a place
that gave me so much.
