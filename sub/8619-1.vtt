02:55.909 --> 02:57.604
Hold on, I gotta come up!

02:57.678 --> 02:59.908
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.845
We can't be late!

03:01.915 --> 03:03.508
We won't!

03:26.740 --> 03:28.435
Who's... who's holding?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.136
If you 're not, then nobody.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.939
We were kind of hoping you were.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.503
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.675
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.946
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.011
You're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

03:42.089 --> 03:43.283
I was just teasin' you!

03:43.357 --> 03:44.790
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

03:44.858 --> 03:47.588
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

03:47.661 --> 03:50.494
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.532
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.964
Are you through
having a tantrum?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.228
I'm not having a tantrum.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.566
Yes, you are. You've been
in the car all of two seconds,

03:57.638 --> 03:58.798
and you're already cursing at me.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.635
I am not cursing at you.

04:00.707 --> 04:04.803
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"

04:04.878 --> 04:06.368
and then before
the sentence was over

04:06.447 --> 04:09.314
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.715
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

04:11.785 --> 04:15.812
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.050
And two, we're not really fighting.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.788
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.090
That wasn't a fight.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.723
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

04:25.799 --> 04:29.667
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.728
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

04:32.806 --> 04:33.795
Oh! Billboard!

04:38.212 --> 04:40.146
So, what's the plan, man?

04:40.214 --> 04:42.182
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.114
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.617
- Of course.
- You 're so good.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.880
I know.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.422
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

04:49.490 --> 04:52.152
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.

04:52.226 --> 04:55.252
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.762
He's got a big thing for Julia.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.094
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,

04:59.166 --> 05:00.827
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.165
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.

05:03.237 --> 05:05.967
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.233
Oh, billboard!

05:14.681 --> 05:17.411
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,

05:17.484 --> 05:18.542
and it's all over.

05:18.619 --> 05:22.180
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,

05:22.256 --> 05:23.723
I'll let you know it worked.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.350
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,

05:26.426 --> 05:28.394
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

05:28.462 --> 05:30.555
and make damn sure they come.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.794
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.325
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

05:37.404 --> 05:39.201
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

05:39.273 --> 05:41.969
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.875
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.311
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.576
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.675
Oh, nothing to write home about.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.152
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.711
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.519
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing."

05:58.592 --> 06:01.993
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.893
You know, it's everything but.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.693
They call that "the thing"?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.324
I call it "the thing."

06:07.834 --> 06:09.358
Do guys like "the thing"?

06:09.436 --> 06:11.131
They like it better than "no thing."

06:12.973 --> 06:15.407
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.033
So you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.099
Correct.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.668
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

06:19.746 --> 06:22.180
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.274
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

06:24.351 --> 06:26.785
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.947
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.854
I was straddling him.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.648
What else?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.696
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...

06:36.763 --> 06:41.564
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

06:41.635 --> 06:44.399
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

06:44.471 --> 06:47.565
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go."

06:47.641 --> 06:50.201
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.211
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say."

06:52.279 --> 06:55.407
I said, "I already know what you're
gonna say, and the answer's no."

06:55.482 --> 06:57.177
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

06:57.250 --> 06:59.775
And I said, "Because you're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.150
'We don't gotta do nothing.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.280
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,

07:03.357 --> 07:05.222
wake up in the morning together.'"

07:05.292 --> 07:08.659
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow."

07:08.729 --> 07:09.991
Yeah, fuck Nate.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.087
I mean, he's cute and all,

07:11.164 --> 07:14.099
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.500
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.

07:17.571 --> 07:21.132
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.199
but no hookin' up with them,

07:23.276 --> 07:26.609
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,

07:26.680 --> 07:28.648
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...

07:28.715 --> 07:33.812
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

07:33.887 --> 07:38.017
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter."

07:38.091 --> 07:40.423
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.758
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,

07:42.829 --> 07:46.458
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

07:46.533 --> 07:50.594
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.668
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!

07:55.742 --> 07:58.438
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

07:58.512 --> 08:00.810
walking the floor of his lake house,

08:00.881 --> 08:04.282
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.909
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,

08:05.986 --> 08:08.546
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.647
you got a puppy dog for life.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.282
I have my own relationship with Ben,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.259
and you're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.624
You call her dad "Ben"?

08:15.696 --> 08:18.028
I'm not a child.
That's his name.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.066
So, when are the boys
showing up?

08:20.133 --> 08:22.294
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.893
Maybe they can bring some pot.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.437
Fuck that. No.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.803
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

08:27.874 --> 08:29.307
or B, depending on their ass.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.638
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

08:30.711 --> 08:33.339
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.539
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.309
Best idea you had all day.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.409
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!

08:40.486 --> 08:42.477
Oh, come on, give me a break.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.150
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.249
Okay.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.502
Jules, let me get a drag.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.838
Thanks.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.630
Oh, my God.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.910
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

09:38.979 --> 09:39.968
Hey.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.640
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.682
Ooh...

09:44.751 --> 09:46.912
So, you must be... must be...

09:46.987 --> 09:49.785
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.084
Shh!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.058
She don't know nothing about it.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.957
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.120
- Soon.
- Tell me what?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.926
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.591
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

10:00.667 --> 10:03.329
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.598
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

10:05.672 --> 10:09.108
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

10:09.176 --> 10:11.201
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

10:11.278 --> 10:13.906
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

10:13.980 --> 10:16.380
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

10:16.449 --> 10:21.045
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

10:21.121 --> 10:24.090
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.454
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.925
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?

10:27.994 --> 10:31.930
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

10:31.998 --> 10:34.660
or Marcy over here,

10:34.734 --> 10:37.294
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

10:37.370 --> 10:41.466
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.600
Okay, so just tell me your way.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.668
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.940
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.640
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,

10:52.719 --> 10:55.779
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

10:55.856 --> 10:57.585
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,

10:57.657 --> 11:00.387
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.688
Got it.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.524
Okay, Marcy, take it.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.636
Howdy.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.005
Hi, there.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.772
Excuse me, but...

11:18.845 --> 11:20.904
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?

11:20.981 --> 11:24.883
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.384
Barry.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.148
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.688
Y'all are gettin' me hot!

11:29.756 --> 11:30.882
Shh!

11:34.060 --> 11:38.224
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.027
Yes, it is.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.034
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.900
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.097
Oh, you did, did you?

11:46.172 --> 11:48.504
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.600
Oh, you do, do you?

11:50.677 --> 11:53.669
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.215
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?

11:56.283 --> 11:59.684
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.721
She got a black girl's ass.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.449
Well, that's what she always says,

12:03.523 --> 12:06.390
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.450
She's got a big ass.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.927
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.861
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.126
Okay, we'll get to the point,

12:13.199 --> 12:15.099
but for your information,
skinny bitch,

12:15.168 --> 12:18.262
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men

12:18.338 --> 12:20.898
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

12:20.974 --> 12:24.102
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.611
If you're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.046
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.446
So, Butterfly...

12:30.517 --> 12:32.007
can I buy you a drink?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.416
I'd love one.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.475
What can I get ya?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.146
I'll take a margarita.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.649
Here ya go.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.827
So, after they buy you a drink

12:41.895 --> 12:44.295
when they raise
their glass to toast,

12:44.364 --> 12:49.358
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...

12:49.436 --> 12:53.805
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

12:53.873 --> 12:59.038
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

12:59.112 --> 13:00.977
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

13:01.047 --> 13:04.016
"Miles to go before you sleep."

13:04.084 --> 13:07.713
And then, if they say that...

13:09.055 --> 13:10.386
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.084
What?

13:12.158 --> 13:14.649
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

13:14.728 --> 13:15.717
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.695
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.391
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.764
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.359
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

13:23.436 --> 13:24.960
thinking you're a chicken shit.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.199
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.298
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!

13:29.376 --> 13:32.140
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.409
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.450
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.543
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

13:40.620 --> 13:43.521
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

13:43.590 --> 13:47.321
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.954
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

13:50.030 --> 13:51.554
you've had a few drinks,

13:51.631 --> 13:53.826
you're kind of loosey-goosey,

13:53.900 --> 13:55.697
you're safe with your girls,

13:55.769 --> 13:58.499
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

13:58.571 --> 14:02.371
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...

14:02.442 --> 14:06.538
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.610
She's making me trip.

14:13.686 --> 14:18.123
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!

14:28.401 --> 14:30.164
You fuckin' idiot!

14:59.132 --> 15:02.192
<i># Baby #</i>

15:19.652 --> 15:24.453
<i># It doesn't matter
what they say #</i>

15:24.524 --> 15:28.085
<i># I know I'm gonna love you
any old way #</i>

15:28.161 --> 15:34.430
<i># What can I do without you? #</i>

15:34.501 --> 15:39.996
<i># Don't want nobody, nobody #</i>

15:40.073 --> 15:43.236
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

15:45.278 --> 15:49.044
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

15:49.883 --> 15:53.717
<i># Don't leave me alone #</i>

15:54.988 --> 15:58.822
<i># Come on home #</i>

16:00.093 --> 16:03.620
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

16:05.165 --> 16:08.066
<i># Baby, it's you... #</i>

16:10.837 --> 16:12.099
Any dead soldiers here?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.197
Uh, these two. Thank you.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.567
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.738
That's a good fucking question.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.553
Lanna-Frank!

16:33.259 --> 16:34.749
Where are you?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.790
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.130
- Shit! Hold on!

16:54.314 --> 16:55.906
So, where are you?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.108
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.145
No. We're not coming over there.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.385
You come over here
like you said you would.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.450
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.996
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. I...

17:11.064 --> 17:12.053
No.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.066
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

17:15.134 --> 17:17.967
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.595
We all hate the name "Shauna,"

17:19.672 --> 17:22.106
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna."

17:59.312 --> 18:00.574
Just remember...

18:00.647 --> 18:03.309
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna."

18:03.383 --> 18:06.580
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.986
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...

18:36.749 --> 18:40.742
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.516
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.955
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

18:46.025 --> 18:49.552
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!

18:49.629 --> 18:52.029
"Warren says it, we do it."

18:52.098 --> 18:54.066
So let's do it!

18:54.133 --> 18:55.191
What is it?

18:55.268 --> 18:59.227
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!

19:00.406 --> 19:01.703
Mmm!

19:04.110 --> 19:05.634
Whoo-hoo!

19:09.282 --> 19:13.082
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.414
What the fuck is it?!

19:14.487 --> 19:16.079
Chartreuse.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.352
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.819
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

19:22.895 --> 19:25.159
Not me.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.028
I'm going out for a smoke.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.500
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.093
You 'll blow up the joint.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.815
Drinks.
What can we get you?

19:45.885 --> 19:46.977
Shanna Banana?

19:47.053 --> 19:49.613
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.658
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.454
Good boy.

20:16.149 --> 20:17.138
Oh, hey, Punky.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.980
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.051
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!

20:57.190 --> 20:59.283
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!

20:59.358 --> 21:01.883
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.792
I just... got lucky.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.660
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.062
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.000
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.058
What, on a porch?

21:11.137 --> 21:13.002
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.097
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

21:15.174 --> 21:17.768
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.436
Not in my car it's not.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.071
Look, you won't get wet.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.309
I promise you.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.777
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.584
Ha ha ha.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.453
I mean...
you know what I mean.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.516
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.925
and we can't come.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.688
I wanna make out...

21:38.764 --> 21:41.562
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.542
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,

21:51.611 --> 21:55.206
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.578
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.844
If you're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

21:58.918 --> 22:01.216
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.

22:01.287 --> 22:02.845
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.356
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.392
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.620
Okay, let's go.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.863
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.153
<i># It was early, early one morning #</i>

22:39.225 --> 22:42.285
<i># When I heard my bulldog bark #</i>

22:42.361 --> 22:45.626
<i># It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons #</i>

22:45.698 --> 22:47.689
<i># Squabblin ' in the dark... #</i>

22:47.767 --> 22:50.327
Now, look, you can't look like
you're trying to get her out of here

22:50.403 --> 22:51.768
before Christian Simonson shows up,

22:51.837 --> 22:54.465
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.529
Yeah, but what's the point?

22:55.608 --> 22:57.576
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,

22:57.643 --> 22:58.803
and it's no guys.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.436
Absolutely no guys.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.107
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,

23:03.182 --> 23:07.915
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.455
You think they're gonna fall for that?

23:10.523 --> 23:13.014
We'll be very convincing.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.721
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.353
We go to Jäger shots.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.590
Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.156
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,

23:22.234 --> 23:24.259
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.

23:24.337 --> 23:25.668
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger

23:25.738 --> 23:27.399
down these
fucking bitches' throats.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.566
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.631
You never know.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.110
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it."

23:33.179 --> 23:34.976
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

23:35.047 --> 23:36.981
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.516
My point exactly.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.711
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"

23:40.786 --> 23:43.482
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?

23:44.490 --> 23:46.151
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.557
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.893
Dude, check it out.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.025
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.

23:58.537 --> 23:59.731
Jesus.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.806
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

24:07.013 --> 24:10.278
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?

24:11.517 --> 24:14.645
<i># See the hole
I shot in his head #</i>

24:14.720 --> 24:17.553
<i># The high sheriff
told the deputy #</i>

24:17.623 --> 24:20.615
<i># Get your pistols
and come with me #</i>

24:20.693 --> 24:24.094
<i># We got to go arrest
a bad man #</i>

24:24.163 --> 24:26.461
<i># Known as Staggolee... #</i>

24:30.036 --> 24:33.028
<i># They laid them on the shelf</i>

24:33.105 --> 24:36.131
<i># If you want
that bad man Staggolee #</i>

24:36.208 --> 24:39.507
<i># You'll have to arrest him yourself</i>

24:39.578 --> 24:42.172
<i># The high sheriff
asked the bartender... #</i>

24:42.248 --> 24:44.307
And where did you two disappear to?

24:44.383 --> 24:45.645
I had to get something
out of the car,

24:45.718 --> 24:48.949
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.886
Ah, good for you, Nate.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.390
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

24:56.195 --> 24:57.822
Who, the dirty hippie?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.728
Meow. She's not a hippie.

24:59.799 --> 25:00.925
She might as well be a hippie.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.226
Thank you, Timmy boy.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.862
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.704
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.840
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?

25:15.915 --> 25:16.904
What about her?

25:19.652 --> 25:20.778
Hey, Warren!

25:20.853 --> 25:23.981
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

25:25.958 --> 25:29.086
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.061
You've been eavesdropping?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.792
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear."

25:33.866 --> 25:35.891
I think I belong
in the latter category.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.864
So, uh, Icy Hot.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.168
You're offering me a ride home?

25:41.240 --> 25:44.869
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.174
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.111
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

25:49.782 --> 25:53.183
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.618
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.713
I know looks can be deceiving.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.648
But I'm a teetotaler.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.853
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

26:02.928 --> 26:04.919
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

26:04.997 --> 26:09.297
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.037
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

26:13.105 --> 26:15.972
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

26:16.041 --> 26:19.704
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.270
Mmm. Really?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.713
Like what?

26:25.818 --> 26:26.944
Women.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.487
Nacho grande platters.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.115
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,

26:32.191 --> 26:33.283
like Warren here.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.185
Alcohol is just a lubricant

26:36.262 --> 26:39.629
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.

26:39.698 --> 26:42.166
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

26:42.234 --> 26:44.168
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

26:45.671 --> 26:46.831
I'm a stuntman.

26:46.906 --> 26:51.275
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.334
How do you know my name?

26:53.412 --> 26:56.540
When you were talking with Warren...

26:56.615 --> 26:57.946
couldn't help but overhear.

26:59.752 --> 27:00.741
Fair enough.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.447
So what's your name, Icy?

27:03.789 --> 27:05.222
Stuntman Mike.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.749
Stuntman Mike's your name?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.625
Tsk. You ask anybody.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.194
Hey, Warren.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.630
Who is this guy?

27:14.700 --> 27:16.531
Stuntman Mike.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.627
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?

27:18.704 --> 27:19.932
He's a stuntman.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.838
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!

27:22.908 --> 27:25.536
<i># I' ve just got to know #</i>

27:25.611 --> 27:27.408
<i># Should I go leave #</i>

27:28.113 --> 27:32.174
<i># And find somebody else #</i>

27:32.251 --> 27:36.017
<i># You know I stood yesterday #</i>

27:36.088 --> 27:37.453
Yeah!

27:38.591 --> 27:39.751
Yeah!

27:42.862 --> 27:43.851
Let's do 'em!

27:43.929 --> 27:45.590
Salud.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.393
Down the snatch.

27:47.466 --> 27:50.958
You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.600
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,

27:55.674 --> 27:57.801
can I buy you that
virgin piña colada?

27:57.877 --> 28:00.072
Thank you, Pam.
That'd be lovely.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.612
Warren!

28:01.680 --> 28:04.808
A, uh, virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend

28:04.884 --> 28:07.512
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.315
Cabo Wabo, virgin.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.821
<i># People, I've been misled #</i>

28:45.357 --> 28:49.054
<i># And I've been afraid #</i>

28:50.362 --> 28:53.229
<i># I've been hit in the head #</i>

28:53.299 --> 28:56.359
<i># And left for days #</i>

28:57.069 --> 28:59.435
<i># I've been abused #</i>

29:00.806 --> 29:03.639
<i># And I've been accused #</i>

29:04.510 --> 29:07.968
<i># I've been refused #</i>

29:08.047 --> 29:09.639
<i># A piece of bread... #</i>

29:10.482 --> 29:13.280
- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.614
Mwah.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.018
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.385
<i>- # In my life before #
- Hey, what's up?</i>

29:17.456 --> 29:18.718
Hey!

29:18.791 --> 29:21.419
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

29:21.493 --> 29:23.461
Hey.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.362
<i># Go wrong as I do today #</i>

29:26.432 --> 29:29.401
<i>- # I want you to stop... #
- Well, let's scootch over, now.</i>

29:29.468 --> 29:31.436
It's about fucking time.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.801
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.499
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.936
What?

29:39.011 --> 29:40.137
That table.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.112
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.672
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

29:44.750 --> 29:45.739
Yep.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.981
She sure is a striking-looking woman.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.988
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...

29:51.056 --> 29:52.045
Look at that hair.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.523
Lots of leave-in conditioner.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.051
Is that jealousy I detect?

29:57.129 --> 30:01.088
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,

30:01.166 --> 30:02.997
there's a real easy way to do that.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.626
Really, what would that be?

30:04.703 --> 30:08.139
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.574
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.167
Enjoy it, cocksucker.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.678
You've earned it.

30:14.747 --> 30:16.681
What did she ever do to you?

30:16.749 --> 30:19.411
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.419
That's what she did to me.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.081
She was her height right now at 12.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.987
She was a monster.

30:26.058 --> 30:29.960
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.827
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

30:32.898 --> 30:34.422
That pituitary case?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.195
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...

30:36.268 --> 30:39.101
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...

30:39.171 --> 30:42.834
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.204
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?

31:18.277 --> 31:19.642
Or somethin'.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.076
No, no, no. Really.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.078
Hey, what do... what do you do?

31:24.983 --> 31:26.280
Really?

31:26.351 --> 31:30.253
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,

31:30.322 --> 31:34.816
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.729
Wait a minute.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.559
You've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.102
Yeah.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.570
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.637
Yeah.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.937
Jungle Julia Lucai.

31:55.013 --> 31:56.947
Stuntman Mike McKay.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.380
Well.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.544
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.952
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

32:04.022 --> 32:05.284
Would you care for some?

32:05.357 --> 32:06.790
Thank you, Julia,

32:06.859 --> 32:09.726
but just the same...
no thanks.

32:09.795 --> 32:11.319
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...

32:21.406 --> 32:23.340
Oh, shit.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.568
Ah! My God.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.539
Sorry. It's nothing.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.516
What the fuck was that?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.955
You got some voucher here.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.686
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.455
No fuckin' clue.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.760
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.801
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral,

32:49.868 --> 32:51.267
a guy falls off a horse,

32:51.336 --> 32:52.428
he says it's him.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.436
You know the show The Virginian?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.839
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

33:00.913 --> 33:02.778
and I looked like him a bit...

33:02.848 --> 33:06.011
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.052
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

33:08.120 --> 33:12.352
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.860
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.

33:15.928 --> 33:19.659
And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh,

33:19.731 --> 33:22.461
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.799
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

33:25.871 --> 33:29.432
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.738
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.677
And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.237
and he brought me
with him on that, till...

33:39.017 --> 33:40.279
And after that...

33:44.456 --> 33:47.823
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?

33:47.893 --> 33:49.258
Sorry.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.317
- No?
- Mm-mm.

33:50.395 --> 33:52.056
No, no.

33:54.633 --> 33:59.866
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

34:02.107 --> 34:06.271
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

34:06.345 --> 34:09.074
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

34:09.147 --> 34:12.775
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.112
How's that?

34:14.186 --> 34:16.677
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

34:16.755 --> 34:18.120
Stuntman Bob.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.864
I'm ready to blaze!

34:32.938 --> 34:35.804
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.138
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.543
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

34:43.014 --> 34:47.281
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.513
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.577
Mm-hmm.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.420
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.722
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.388
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

34:58.463 --> 35:00.158
Mmm, us girls.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.529
Good idea.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.527
Ladies?

35:06.905 --> 35:07.894
Thanks.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.803
Cheers, Butterfly.

35:13.211 --> 35:17.511
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

35:17.582 --> 35:19.345
"And I have promises to keep,

35:19.418 --> 35:22.819
And miles to go
before I sleep."

35:22.888 --> 35:24.856
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

35:25.957 --> 35:29.859
"Miles to go
before you sleep."

35:31.763 --> 35:33.253
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...

35:33.332 --> 35:34.492
Mike.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.963
Mike.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.025
She already broke off that dance.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.593
Is that true?

35:41.273 --> 35:43.867
Did I miss my chance?

35:46.611 --> 35:48.636
Do I frighten you?

35:53.085 --> 35:54.950
Is it my scar?

35:57.122 --> 35:58.851
It's your car.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.983
Ah, yeah, I know.

36:01.059 --> 36:03.220
Sorry.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.126
It's my mom's car.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.261
Have you been following us?

36:09.334 --> 36:12.030
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...

36:12.104 --> 36:14.368
it's just so damn small.

36:14.439 --> 36:17.067
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.542
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.440
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.848
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.886
So you really weren't following us?

36:28.954 --> 36:32.788
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

36:35.060 --> 36:39.360
So, how about that lap dance?

36:39.431 --> 36:41.160
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

36:41.233 --> 36:43.599
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.095
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

36:47.172 --> 36:49.197
I'm good that way.

36:49.274 --> 36:53.074
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?

36:53.145 --> 36:54.339
Wounded, slightly.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.675
Why should I be wounded?

36:55.747 --> 36:58.716
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

36:58.784 --> 37:01.548
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.222
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

37:06.825 --> 37:12.195
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.956
So...

37:18.236 --> 37:22.070
How about that lap dance?

37:23.275 --> 37:25.903
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.010
Well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

37:31.082 --> 37:33.073
that rain check'll be worthless.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.377
But that's okay.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.520
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.190
You're still a nice girl.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.058
And I still like you.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.626
But I must warn you of something.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.326
You know how people say,

37:52.404 --> 37:54.099
"You're okay in my book,"

37:54.172 --> 37:57.437
or, "In my book, that's no good."

37:57.509 --> 38:03.175
Well, I actually have a book.

38:03.248 --> 38:07.150
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

38:07.219 --> 38:11.622
And now I've met you,
and you're goin' in the book.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.888
Except...

38:14.960 --> 38:19.090
I'm afraid I must file you...

38:19.164 --> 38:21.098
under...

38:21.166 --> 38:22.690
"Chicken Shit."

38:22.767 --> 38:25.065
And what if I did it?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.400
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"

38:27.472 --> 38:29.565
then, now, could I?

38:29.641 --> 38:30.938
What's your name again?

38:32.344 --> 38:35.245
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

38:35.313 --> 38:36.871
I'm Butterfly.

38:36.948 --> 38:41.476
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.282
Yeah, it is.

38:43.355 --> 38:44.344
Yeah.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.654
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

39:01.740 --> 39:04.766
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

39:04.843 --> 39:06.674
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy

39:06.745 --> 39:09.578
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?

39:22.394 --> 39:26.660
<i># Aah, aah #</i>

39:27.265 --> 39:31.668

<i># Joe starts playing on a Latin kick #</i>

40:59.057 --> 41:00.046
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:00.125 --> 41:03.288
<i># Around her waist
she wore three fishnets #</i>

41:03.361 --> 41:04.555
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:04.629 --> 41:07.223
<i># She started dancing
with the castanets #</i>

41:07.298 --> 41:08.663
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:08.733 --> 41:11.793
<i># I didn't know just what to expect #</i>

41:11.870 --> 41:12.859
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:12.937 --> 41:15.906
<i># She threw her arms
around my neck #</i>

41:15.974 --> 41:16.963
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:17.042 --> 41:19.806
<i># We started dancing
all around the floor #</i>

41:19.878 --> 41:20.936
<i># In Mexico #</i>

41:21.012 --> 41:24.607
<i># And then she did a dance
I never saw before #</i>

41:24.683 --> 41:29.211
<i># So if you're south of the border #</i>

41:29.287 --> 41:33.724
<i># I mean a-down in a-Mexico #</i>

41:33.792 --> 41:38.491
<i># And you wanna get straight,
man, don't hesitate #</i>

41:38.563 --> 41:42.863

41:45.236 --> 41:47.864

41:52.544 --> 41:54.842
<i># He wears a purple sash #</i>

41:54.913 --> 41:57.507
<i># And a black moustache #</i>

41:57.582 --> 41:59.049
<i># In a honky... #</i>

42:00.885 --> 42:02.147
I'm driving.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.348
We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

42:05.423 --> 42:06.412
Ready to go?

42:06.491 --> 42:07.685
Yeah.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.522
- Bye.
Bye.

42:12.797 --> 42:15.027
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

42:16.634 --> 42:18.795
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

42:19.938 --> 42:21.872
He's just giving me a ride.

42:21.940 --> 42:22.964
Oh, no doubt.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.339
Have a nice ride!

42:26.745 --> 42:28.610
Look, double fucks.

42:32.951 --> 42:34.919
I am not gonna fuck him.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.419
I can hear you.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.348
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.756
Bye.

42:45.830 --> 42:46.888
Bye-bye!

42:53.271 --> 42:55.239
Wow, that's fucking scary.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.331
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

42:57.408 --> 42:59.433
scary tends to impress.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.039
Is it safe?

43:02.113 --> 43:04.081
No, it's better than safe.

43:04.149 --> 43:05.776
It's death-proof.

43:05.850 --> 43:08.375
How do you make a car death-proof?

43:08.453 --> 43:10.250
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.949
You've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

43:13.024 --> 43:15.458
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

43:15.527 --> 43:16.516
Yeah.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.085
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

43:19.164 --> 43:21.189
CGI?

43:21.266 --> 43:25.202
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you're right.

43:25.270 --> 43:27.534
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...

43:27.605 --> 43:31.405
Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,

43:31.476 --> 43:33.137
the White Line Fever days...

43:33.211 --> 43:36.180
real cars smashing into real cars.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.875
Real dumb people driving 'em.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.976
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

43:42.053 --> 43:44.613
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

43:44.689 --> 43:45.678
Voila!

43:45.757 --> 43:49.193
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

43:50.728 --> 43:54.323
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

43:54.399 --> 43:58.199
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.470
Just for the experience.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.442
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

44:09.514 --> 44:11.038
Well, this is a movie car.

44:11.115 --> 44:14.642
Sometimes when you're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...

44:14.719 --> 44:16.880
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

44:16.955 --> 44:19.890
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

44:22.627 --> 44:24.288
There you go.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.660
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

44:26.731 --> 44:28.631
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.692
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

44:31.769 --> 44:33.669
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes."

44:33.738 --> 44:35.069
But look at the bright side, Pam...

44:35.139 --> 44:38.108
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

44:39.911 --> 44:41.708
That is a bright side.

44:42.747 --> 44:43.907
I thought so.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.340
Well, Pam...

45:11.409 --> 45:12.671
which way are you going?

45:12.744 --> 45:14.575
- Left or right?
- Right.

45:14.646 --> 45:16.614
Ah, that's too bad.

45:17.282 --> 45:18.306
Why?

45:18.383 --> 45:22.251
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you 'd be going left or right.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.447
You see, we're both going left.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.513
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

45:26.591 --> 45:27.888
and if that was the case,

45:27.959 --> 45:30.621
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.061
But since
you're going the other way,

45:33.131 --> 45:34.689
I'm afraid...

45:34.766 --> 45:38.167
you're gonna
have to start getting scared...

45:38.236 --> 45:39.294
immediately.

45:39.370 --> 45:40.462
What the fuck?!

45:49.981 --> 45:51.812
Cocksucking motherfucker!

45:51.883 --> 45:53.475
Just fucking let me out of here!

45:53.551 --> 45:55.109
I'll fucking rip your fucking...

45:55.186 --> 45:56.585
Stop the fucking car!

45:56.654 --> 45:58.485
Why are you being such a shit?

46:38.763 --> 46:40.560
Okay.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.030
Here's the thing.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.193
I get it.

46:44.268 --> 46:46.964
I... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.

46:47.772 --> 46:51.538
Um, but if you just stop right now,

46:51.609 --> 46:54.009
you know, and... and let me out,

46:54.078 --> 46:57.445
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.

46:57.515 --> 46:58.846
I know all about jokes.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.349
Ha ha ha!

47:00.418 --> 47:03.854
I promise everything'll be fine.

47:03.921 --> 47:06.412
Just... just... just let me out.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.480
Please?

47:07.558 --> 47:09.321
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!

47:10.395 --> 47:13.887
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

47:13.965 --> 47:17.230
Well, that wasn't a lie.

47:17.301 --> 47:19.895
This car is 100% death proof.

47:20.805 --> 47:23.774
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

47:23.841 --> 47:26.833
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.

48:04.282 --> 48:07.877
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

48:22.366 --> 48:23.355
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:23.434 --> 48:26.665
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.130
So, you got it?

48:29.207 --> 48:32.074
Thanks, honey.
You're gonna play it next song, right?

48:33.311 --> 48:35.176
Good boy.

48:36.647 --> 48:38.308
Growl!

48:38.382 --> 48:40.441
Bye-bye.

48:40.518 --> 48:41.951
Who do you want to hear?

48:42.019 --> 48:43.919
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

48:43.988 --> 48:45.250
Who?

48:45.323 --> 48:48.952
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

48:49.026 --> 48:50.425
Who the fuck are they?

48:50.495 --> 48:53.293
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,

48:53.364 --> 48:55.127
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,

48:55.199 --> 48:56.860
he would have ended up in this group,

48:56.934 --> 49:00.665
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.

49:00.738 --> 49:02.296
And if you ask me,
he should have.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.773
That's my boy!

49:18.856 --> 49:20.790
<i># Hold tight, count to three #</i>

49:20.858 --> 49:22.917
<i># Gotta stay close by me #</i>

49:22.994 --> 49:24.757
<i># And hold tight, sing and shout #</i>

49:24.829 --> 49:26.694
<i># Just ride my roundabout #</i>

49:26.764 --> 49:28.755
<i># And hold tight, shut your eyes #</i>

49:28.833 --> 49:33.930
<i># Girl, you suit me for size... #</i>

49:34.005 --> 49:37.771
<i># Forget the other guys #</i>

49:37.842 --> 49:41.278
<i># You'll never fall
each time you call #</i>

49:41.345 --> 49:45.213
<i># Hold tight, hold tight #</i>

49:45.283 --> 49:51.051
<i># Hold tight... #</i>

49:51.122 --> 49:55.218
<i># Hold tight, make me feel,
what you say is for real #</i>

49:55.293 --> 49:57.158
<i># And hold tight, carousel #</i>

49:57.228 --> 49:58.820
<i># Girl, you'll soon ring my bell #</i>

49:58.896 --> 50:00.989
<i># And hold tight, we will fly #</i>

50:01.065 --> 50:06.162

50:06.237 --> 50:10.071
<i># We're gonna make the sky #</i>

50:10.141 --> 50:11.972
<i># You'll never fall #</i>

50:54.418 --> 50:56.852
I want to hear
this part of the song louder!

51:44.268 --> 51:45.929
Do you remember anything?

51:47.872 --> 51:50.170
Uh... I... I don't remember.

51:53.744 --> 51:55.177
Doctor Block.

52:02.053 --> 52:04.647
Self-restraints to Room 310.

52:04.722 --> 52:07.122
Self-restraints to Room 310.

52:08.326 --> 52:13.628
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

52:13.698 --> 52:15.928
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.831
Come on now, Sis.

52:17.902 --> 52:20.200
You just tell us.

52:20.271 --> 52:21.602
How bad is he?

52:26.277 --> 52:28.006
He got banged up real good.

52:28.079 --> 52:32.482
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.

52:32.550 --> 52:33.744
Is that it?

52:35.553 --> 52:37.282
He was real lucky.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.253
That'll be all?

52:41.325 --> 52:44.624
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

52:48.466 --> 52:49.956
Son of a bitch.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.094
So, Pop.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.694
What do you think?

52:54.772 --> 52:56.603
Well, Son Number One,

52:56.674 --> 53:00.838
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

53:01.879 --> 53:04.143
Well, give it a shot.

53:04.215 --> 53:07.241
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

53:07.318 --> 53:10.048
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

53:10.121 --> 53:13.887
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.

53:15.459 --> 53:18.485
Well, what are you gonna do?

53:18.562 --> 53:20.257
Not a goddamn thing.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.595
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

53:23.501 --> 53:28.438
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,

53:28.506 --> 53:32.374
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

53:32.443 --> 53:36.846
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?

53:36.914 --> 53:38.677
Well, I can't prove it.

53:38.749 --> 53:41.912
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.

53:41.986 --> 53:45.353
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.948
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...

53:48.025 --> 53:50.755
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

53:50.828 --> 53:52.523
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

53:52.596 --> 53:53.961
Did any of 'em survive?

53:54.031 --> 53:55.931
Shit.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.468
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

53:58.536 --> 54:00.936
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...

54:01.005 --> 54:03.098
they all princess died.

54:10.214 --> 54:11.613
Why?

54:11.682 --> 54:15.982
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

54:16.053 --> 54:18.044
The only way I can figure it.

54:18.122 --> 54:23.253
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

54:23.327 --> 54:26.387
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

54:27.731 --> 54:31.724
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

54:32.903 --> 54:35.428
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

54:35.506 --> 54:38.998
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

54:39.076 --> 54:41.943
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.

54:42.012 --> 54:45.004
But I got me a goddamn bartender

54:45.082 --> 54:48.711
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.353
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,

54:52.423 --> 54:56.154
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

54:56.227 --> 55:00.061
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.428
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.695
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?

55:04.768 --> 55:05.860
Tsk.

55:05.936 --> 55:08.871
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,

55:11.350 --> 55:14.513
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.

55:14.586 --> 55:15.848
Alert authorities.

55:15.921 --> 55:19.516
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.

55:19.591 --> 55:24.722
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy

55:24.797 --> 55:27.732
following the NASCAR circuit.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.960
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.

55:30.034 --> 55:33.492
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.

55:33.571 --> 55:34.560
And just because I can't

55:34.639 --> 55:38.871
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,

55:38.943 --> 55:41.741
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...

55:41.813 --> 55:43.804
if he ever does it again,

55:43.881 --> 55:47.180
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

55:58.462 --> 56:00.657
<i># You know you're sliding down #</i>

56:01.799 --> 56:03.698
<i># Against your heart #</i>

56:05.168 --> 56:06.760
<i># Yeah, you got one #</i>

56:10.173 --> 56:12.767
<i># Just close your eyes #</i>

56:13.844 --> 56:16.244
<i># So you can see #</i>

56:17.047 --> 56:19.379
<i># So you can see #</i>

56:20.250 --> 56:21.945
<i># No, baby, I don 't care #</i>

56:22.018 --> 56:24.851
<i># What they say, it's so easy #</i>

56:28.959 --> 56:31.189
<i># No, baby, I don 't care #</i>

56:31.261 --> 56:33.855
<i># What they say, it's so easy #</i>

56:37.566 --> 56:39.158
<i># Yeah, it's comin' on #</i>

56:41.203 --> 56:43.296
<i># It's getting sweeter #</i>

56:44.406 --> 56:46.101
<i># And sweeter #</i>

56:49.445 --> 56:51.913
<i># If you're gonna drown #</i>

56:53.215 --> 56:55.479
<i># Then do it the right way #</i>

56:57.086 --> 56:58.747
<i># The right way #</i>

57:00.489 --> 57:05.449
<i># I don't care what they say, it's so easy #</i>

57:08.998 --> 57:12.023
<i># I don't care what they say, it's so... #</i>

57:13.167 --> 57:16.330
Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.

57:16.404 --> 57:18.736
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

57:18.806 --> 57:20.068
And so what happened then?

57:20.141 --> 57:24.407
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.

57:24.479 --> 57:28.074
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.

57:28.149 --> 57:30.947
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.

57:31.019 --> 57:32.919
Mm, I love them mushy lips.

57:32.987 --> 57:36.115
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,

57:36.190 --> 57:38.750
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,

57:38.826 --> 57:43.286
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.

57:43.364 --> 57:44.762
Damn, that sounds sexy!

57:44.831 --> 57:46.355
It was sexy.

57:46.433 --> 57:50.335
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?

57:50.404 --> 57:52.099
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?

57:52.172 --> 57:55.903
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zoë at the airport, I need coffee.

57:55.976 --> 57:59.810
Since you're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?

58:02.182 --> 58:03.479
We didn't know you were awake.

58:03.550 --> 58:05.245
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

58:05.319 --> 58:08.413
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

58:09.189 --> 58:10.656
And some Red Apple Tans.

58:10.724 --> 58:13.192
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.

58:15.429 --> 58:17.862
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.

58:17.930 --> 58:20.763
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.

58:22.635 --> 58:24.125
Motherfuckers.

58:40.920 --> 58:42.854
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

58:42.922 --> 58:45.516
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

58:45.591 --> 58:48.321
G.O.
G.O.!

59:13.585 --> 59:19.717
# It's not the way you kiss
that says you're mine #

59:23.094 --> 59:27.553
# Many, many, many nights go by #

59:27.631 --> 59:33.399
# I sit alone at home and cry over you #

59:33.470 --> 59:36.667
# What can I do #

59:36.740 --> 59:42.201
# Don't want nobody, nobody #

59:42.279 --> 59:45.578
# 'Cause, baby, it's you #

59:55.059 --> 59:58.620
# Is it true what they say #

59:58.695 --> 01:00:02.858
# All about you #

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:10.295
# They say you'll never
ever never be true #

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:17.573
# It doesn't matter what they say #

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:21.208
# I know I'm gonna
love you any old way #

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.253
# What would I do #

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.517
# Without you #

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.922
# I don't want nobody... #

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:33.025
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.

01:00:34.396 --> 01:00:37.024
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.

01:00:37.099 --> 01:00:39.226
No, it wasn't you.

01:00:39.301 --> 01:00:41.997
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.

01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:46.271
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.

01:01:02.157 --> 01:01:05.217
<i># I don't care
what they saying to me #</i>

01:01:11.866 --> 01:01:13.390
Little dick.

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.567
Clearly.

01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:23.200
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.

01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:26.604
Get me a fuckin' smoke.

01:02:50.795 --> 01:02:52.558
What?

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:54.598
Did you just see the...

01:02:54.665 --> 01:02:55.654
What?

01:02:57.935 --> 01:02:59.061
Nothing, honey.

01:03:22.692 --> 01:03:23.681
Y'ello.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.091
It's me.

01:03:25.161 --> 01:03:26.458
Miss me?

01:03:27.964 --> 01:03:30.558
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.

01:03:30.634 --> 01:03:34.400
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.

01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:38.908
Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.

01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:43.969
You got Allure?

01:03:44.047 --> 01:03:45.947
Magazines by the window.

01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:01.990
Here you are!

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.695
You hot mama, you.

01:04:06.769 --> 01:04:08.600
See you in a second.

01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:11.765
$3.85... out of 20.

01:04:15.878 --> 01:04:18.870
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:24.481
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

01:04:27.022 --> 01:04:29.456
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

01:04:29.525 --> 01:04:30.684
Thought I'd ask.

01:04:30.758 --> 01:04:32.521
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:38.325
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.

01:04:43.571 --> 01:04:44.833
This month's?

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.938
Listen to this.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.743
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.

01:04:53.815 --> 01:04:54.975
- No way.
- Way!

01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:57.540
I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.

01:04:57.618 --> 01:05:00.052
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.

01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:02.385
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

01:05:02.457 --> 01:05:04.321
27 bucks?

01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:06.825
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.

01:05:06.893 --> 01:05:09.794
We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.

01:05:09.863 --> 01:05:11.797
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.

01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:13.992
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.

01:05:14.067 --> 01:05:15.329
What, me, you, and Kim?

01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:17.233
Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.

01:05:17.304 --> 01:05:20.967
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.

01:05:21.808 --> 01:05:24.777
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,

01:05:24.845 --> 01:05:28.212
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.

01:05:28.281 --> 01:05:32.308
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.

01:05:50.035 --> 01:05:52.333
Whoo!

01:05:55.975 --> 01:05:57.203
Oh, my God!

01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:06.750
Got it!

01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:18.386
...the actress...

01:06:29.874 --> 01:06:31.364
Oh, boy.

01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:36.370
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

01:06:36.448 --> 01:06:41.044
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.

01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:43.587
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?

01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:46.646
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

01:06:46.723 --> 01:06:49.590
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:53.756
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.

01:06:53.831 --> 01:06:55.389
So how's the shoot going?

01:06:55.466 --> 01:06:57.525
Great. We're having the best time.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.694
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.001
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

01:07:03.073 --> 01:07:06.668
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

01:07:06.743 --> 01:07:08.643
So let's hear it, ladies.

01:07:08.712 --> 01:07:11.112
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

01:07:11.181 --> 01:07:13.809
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

01:07:13.884 --> 01:07:16.910
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

01:07:16.987 --> 01:07:19.113
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

01:07:19.188 --> 01:07:21.486
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

01:07:22.758 --> 01:07:23.747
What's his perversion?

01:07:25.862 --> 01:07:28.296
He likes to watch me pee.

01:07:28.865 --> 01:07:33.325
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:35.461
# P-I-S-S-I-N-G #

01:07:35.538 --> 01:07:36.527
Ooh!

01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:38.568
Yeah, but not no more.

01:07:38.641 --> 01:07:40.871
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

01:07:40.943 --> 01:07:42.808
You had a one-off with the Rock?

01:07:42.879 --> 01:07:45.313
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:49.215
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.

01:07:49.285 --> 01:07:50.946
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.614
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.

01:07:54.689 --> 01:07:57.123
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

01:07:57.192 --> 01:08:00.559
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

01:08:00.629 --> 01:08:03.860
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

01:08:03.932 --> 01:08:05.559
Who'd you steal him from?

01:08:05.634 --> 01:08:06.931
Nobody!

01:08:07.002 --> 01:08:09.562
Kim!
- Wha... what?

01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:11.299
He totally had a girlfriend.

01:08:11.373 --> 01:08:15.002
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

01:08:15.076 --> 01:08:17.169
I did not steal him!

01:08:17.245 --> 01:08:22.376
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

01:08:24.618 --> 01:08:28.384
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

01:08:28.455 --> 01:08:31.185
I had a set crush on Cecil.

01:08:31.258 --> 01:08:34.591
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

01:08:34.662 --> 01:08:36.892
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

01:08:36.964 --> 01:08:39.660
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

01:08:39.733 --> 01:08:44.796
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:52.037
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

01:08:52.112 --> 01:08:53.578
Oh, it's so funny!

01:08:53.647 --> 01:08:56.171
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.046
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

01:08:58.118 --> 01:09:01.086
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

01:09:01.154 --> 01:09:04.089
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:07.358
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

01:09:07.426 --> 01:09:10.520
He fucked her on my birthday.

01:09:10.596 --> 01:09:13.430
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

01:09:13.499 --> 01:09:16.366
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:19.166
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:23.675
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.734
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:28.903
What did he get you?

01:09:32.484 --> 01:09:33.952
He made me a tape.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.746
He made you a tape?

01:09:35.821 --> 01:09:38.051
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

01:09:38.122 --> 01:09:39.488
He made you a tape?

01:09:39.558 --> 01:09:42.550
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

01:09:42.627 --> 01:09:45.721
Yes, I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

01:09:45.796 --> 01:09:47.822
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:51.595
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:54.264
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

01:09:54.339 --> 01:09:56.705
How can you not be on my side?

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:58.265
I admit, that sounds bad.

01:09:58.343 --> 01:09:59.605
It is bad!

01:09:59.678 --> 01:10:02.545
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:03.774
Were you two fucking?

01:10:03.849 --> 01:10:05.339
Hell, no.

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:07.282
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

01:10:07.352 --> 01:10:08.340
Sorry.

01:10:08.419 --> 01:10:11.980
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

01:10:12.056 --> 01:10:15.048
What do you mean "No, of course not"?

01:10:15.126 --> 01:10:18.118
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

01:10:18.195 --> 01:10:21.494
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

01:10:21.565 --> 01:10:23.829
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...

01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:26.836
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

01:10:26.904 --> 01:10:32.103
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

01:10:32.176 --> 01:10:37.842
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.

01:10:37.915 --> 01:10:41.112
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:44.719
I've let him give me a foot massage,

01:10:44.788 --> 01:10:48.656
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

01:10:48.725 --> 01:10:51.455
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,

01:10:51.528 --> 01:10:53.052
but he just acting like a man.

01:10:53.129 --> 01:10:55.222
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

01:10:55.298 --> 01:10:56.629
Let me get this straight...

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:00.966
you're not fucking him,
you're not sucking him,

01:11:01.037 --> 01:11:04.905
you're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:07.135
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:10.577
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...

01:11:10.647 --> 01:11:12.308
and your lack of one.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.486
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.

01:11:20.556 --> 01:11:24.993
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.961
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:29.759
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.

01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:30.992
I'm not gonna do that!

01:11:31.066 --> 01:11:33.626
I know you won't!
But you know who will...

01:11:33.702 --> 01:11:36.671
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

01:11:36.739 --> 01:11:39.799
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,

01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:43.675
but it is true if you've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil

01:11:43.746 --> 01:11:48.308
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:53.086
So Zoë, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

01:11:53.154 --> 01:11:56.487
What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.

01:11:56.557 --> 01:11:59.993
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.

01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:02.325
Cheers to that.
- Word.

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.258
Cheers.

01:12:04.332 --> 01:12:05.856
So Zoë...

01:12:07.001 --> 01:12:10.869
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

01:12:12.006 --> 01:12:15.407
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

01:12:15.476 --> 01:12:19.105
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.238
So I do.

01:12:20.314 --> 01:12:22.646
Then "A little fu-ther!"

01:12:22.717 --> 01:12:27.380
So I step back a little fu-ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

01:12:27.454 --> 01:12:33.393
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.894
...with God knows how many rocks

01:12:35.962 --> 01:12:40.194
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

01:12:40.267 --> 01:12:42.258
I probably would have broken my neck.

01:12:42.335 --> 01:12:46.066
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

01:12:47.741 --> 01:12:51.768
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:54.370
and Zoë starts fuckin' around.

01:12:54.447 --> 01:12:58.542
And... bam! ...if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

01:13:00.019 --> 01:13:01.782
Nice.

01:13:01.854 --> 01:13:04.516
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

01:13:05.624 --> 01:13:08.092
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.721
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about."

01:13:11.797 --> 01:13:14.163
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

01:13:14.233 --> 01:13:15.598
What happened?

01:13:15.668 --> 01:13:18.034
What, with Zoë, the cat?

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:19.127
Nothing.

01:13:19.205 --> 01:13:23.198
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:25.573
Zoë just lands on her feet.

01:13:25.644 --> 01:13:29.774
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...

01:13:29.849 --> 01:13:34.911
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.

01:13:34.986 --> 01:13:39.320
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.654
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

01:13:41.726 --> 01:13:45.560
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:50.124
Well, physically speaking,
Zoë is amazing.

01:13:50.201 --> 01:13:52.863
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

01:13:53.705 --> 01:13:56.833
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoë on that front.

01:13:56.908 --> 01:13:58.933
Kim, I like you too.

01:13:59.878 --> 01:14:04.338
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoë's prowess,

01:14:04.415 --> 01:14:07.144
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.

01:14:07.217 --> 01:14:10.744
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoë did.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:14.723
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

01:14:14.791 --> 01:14:16.691
and she still fell in.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.854
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:23.024
Hey, I resemble that remark.

01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:28.363
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

01:14:31.642 --> 01:14:33.473
Check it out, bitch.

01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:35.909
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

01:14:35.979 --> 01:14:37.173
What's a Roscoe?

01:14:37.247 --> 01:14:38.544
Roscoe's a pistol.

01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:41.316
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

01:14:41.384 --> 01:14:43.375
You have a license to carry?

01:14:43.452 --> 01:14:47.354
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.887
Oh, I didn't know you were...

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:56.723
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

01:14:57.833 --> 01:14:59.767
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

01:14:59.835 --> 01:15:03.896
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

01:15:03.973 --> 01:15:05.998
Do I know? Yes.

01:15:06.075 --> 01:15:09.738
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

01:15:09.812 --> 01:15:12.678
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

01:15:12.747 --> 01:15:16.342
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

01:15:16.418 --> 01:15:19.148
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.020
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

01:15:23.091 --> 01:15:25.992
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:27.756
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

01:15:27.829 --> 01:15:31.526
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

01:15:31.599 --> 01:15:35.865
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

01:15:35.937 --> 01:15:40.397
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

01:15:40.475 --> 01:15:42.272
I wanna shut that nigga down!

01:15:44.145 --> 01:15:46.375
How about a knife, at least?

01:15:46.447 --> 01:15:48.881
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

01:15:50.784 --> 01:15:52.684
They get shot!

01:15:52.753 --> 01:15:56.780
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

01:15:56.857 --> 01:16:00.520
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

01:16:00.594 --> 01:16:03.995
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:07.625
So Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

01:16:09.336 --> 01:16:12.965
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.476
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

01:16:16.543 --> 01:16:21.241
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

01:16:21.314 --> 01:16:25.580
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.

01:16:28.554 --> 01:16:31.114
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:33.590
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:38.153
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:45.263
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

01:16:45.338 --> 01:16:46.669
No worries, mate.

01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:48.969
I've got it all worked out.

01:16:49.042 --> 01:16:52.273
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:55.802
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

01:16:55.881 --> 01:16:58.645
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

01:17:01.186 --> 01:17:03.381
What do you mean by that, mate?

01:17:03.455 --> 01:17:06.515
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never...

01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:10.049
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

01:17:10.128 --> 01:17:12.824
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

01:17:14.733 --> 01:17:16.530
I'm so sorry. I will nev...

01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:19.294
Oh, it's okay.

01:17:19.371 --> 01:17:22.465
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:25.704
Auckland, to answer your question.

01:17:25.777 --> 01:17:28.836
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

01:17:28.913 --> 01:17:32.508
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:35.051
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

01:17:35.119 --> 01:17:38.054
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

01:17:38.122 --> 01:17:39.714
looking at cars for sale,

01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:44.454
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

01:17:44.528 --> 01:17:47.793
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

01:17:47.865 --> 01:17:51.631
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

01:17:51.702 --> 01:17:53.499
And you wanna buy it?

01:17:54.772 --> 01:17:58.435
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

01:17:58.509 --> 01:18:02.535
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.

01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:05.740
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:07.373
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:11.216
Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:12.720
If I can get this guy

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:16.657
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.591
What's Vanishing Point?

01:18:19.696 --> 01:18:21.664
What's Vanishing Point?

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:24.700
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:27.736
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:31.331
Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:36.401
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:39.970
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:42.414
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:44.816
Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.355
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:51.449
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:54.223
Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.854
- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:58.900
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:02.698
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:05.467
Big Wednesday, all the classics.

01:19:22.056 --> 01:19:23.956
What do you horny gals want?

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:30.861
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:32.399
Right up here, ladies.

01:19:47.013 --> 01:19:50.073
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!

01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:52.584
Fuckin' legendary, mate.

01:19:54.821 --> 01:20:00.157
Sweet ass. Well, if you 'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.

01:20:00.227 --> 01:20:01.717
You ladies take your time.

01:20:08.568 --> 01:20:11.628
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:14.299
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

01:20:14.374 --> 01:20:15.466
What?

01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:20.069
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

01:20:20.813 --> 01:20:22.542
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

01:20:22.615 --> 01:20:24.549
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

01:20:24.617 --> 01:20:25.811
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

01:20:25.884 --> 01:20:26.873
Sorry.

01:20:26.952 --> 01:20:29.716
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:33.053
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.218
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:38.286
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

01:20:38.364 --> 01:20:40.127
- But...
- But, my ass!

01:20:40.199 --> 01:20:43.225
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

01:20:43.302 --> 01:20:46.362
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

01:20:46.438 --> 01:20:51.340
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

01:20:51.409 --> 01:20:54.105
Now, did you or did you not say that?

01:20:54.178 --> 01:20:57.443
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

01:20:57.515 --> 01:21:00.951
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

01:21:01.019 --> 01:21:02.953
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

01:21:03.021 --> 01:21:06.957
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...

01:21:07.025 --> 01:21:08.253
Damn skippy you meant it!

01:21:08.326 --> 01:21:11.022
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!

01:21:11.095 --> 01:21:13.120
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

01:21:13.197 --> 01:21:17.224
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

01:21:17.302 --> 01:21:18.997
You are such a liar!

01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:24.667
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,

01:21:24.742 --> 01:21:28.142
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

01:21:28.211 --> 01:21:31.874
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...

01:21:31.948 --> 01:21:34.075
I would have added a "however."

01:21:34.851 --> 01:21:35.840
Right?

01:21:41.325 --> 01:21:43.589
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:48.529
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

01:21:48.598 --> 01:21:50.725
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

01:21:50.801 --> 01:21:54.032
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

01:22:01.577 --> 01:22:03.704
I'll be your best friend.

01:22:03.779 --> 01:22:06.680
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

01:22:06.749 --> 01:22:08.046
I'll crack your back.

01:22:08.117 --> 01:22:09.584
You'll crack it anyway.

01:22:09.652 --> 01:22:12.382
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

01:22:12.455 --> 01:22:16.118
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:18.888
Whenever you want it, you've got it.
You don't even have to ask.

01:22:18.961 --> 01:22:22.419
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

01:22:29.638 --> 01:22:34.074
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.

01:22:35.343 --> 01:22:36.332
Deal.

01:22:38.146 --> 01:22:40.944
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.

01:22:41.015 --> 01:22:44.007
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:45.575
What?

01:22:45.653 --> 01:22:50.056
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.

01:22:50.125 --> 01:22:53.526
I just can't believe
what you said.

01:22:54.863 --> 01:22:56.660
You two got some fuckin' balls.

01:22:56.731 --> 01:22:58.164
What?

01:22:58.233 --> 01:22:59.723
Don't play dumbass with me.

01:22:59.801 --> 01:23:04.795
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

01:23:04.873 --> 01:23:08.569
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,

01:23:08.642 --> 01:23:12.442
but because Zoë wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.

01:23:12.513 --> 01:23:16.472
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:21.044
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.918
Bullshit on that.

01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:25.015
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

01:23:25.092 --> 01:23:28.994
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

01:23:29.062 --> 01:23:32.725
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

01:23:33.567 --> 01:23:35.535
You're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.

01:23:35.602 --> 01:23:36.933
What, drive a car?

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:39.063
We're doing more than that.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:40.833
What, drive it fast?

01:23:42.241 --> 01:23:43.902
We're doing more than that.

01:23:43.976 --> 01:23:48.538
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:53.010
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

01:23:53.085 --> 01:23:55.519
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

01:23:55.588 --> 01:23:58.557
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?

01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:00.683
'Cause you're a mum.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.057
Yeah.

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:07.563
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

01:24:07.633 --> 01:24:11.535
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

01:24:11.604 --> 01:24:14.470
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

01:24:14.539 --> 01:24:18.805
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

01:24:18.877 --> 01:24:21.277
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,

01:24:21.346 --> 01:24:25.043
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

01:24:25.116 --> 01:24:26.105
Besides...

01:24:27.452 --> 01:24:30.012
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:35.985
Okay, how about this?

01:24:36.795 --> 01:24:39.958
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.

01:24:41.132 --> 01:24:43.930
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

01:24:44.703 --> 01:24:45.863
But don't worry.

01:24:46.738 --> 01:24:48.796
He'll say yes.

01:24:48.873 --> 01:24:51.000
What are you gonna do, blow him?

01:24:51.075 --> 01:24:52.235
No.

01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:56.136
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

01:25:00.317 --> 01:25:02.012
That's a good one.

01:25:02.086 --> 01:25:03.451
Not really.

01:25:04.488 --> 01:25:07.787
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

01:25:12.129 --> 01:25:13.528
Okay, Mama, listen up.

01:25:13.597 --> 01:25:17.328
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:20.234
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

01:25:20.304 --> 01:25:23.329
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

01:25:23.406 --> 01:25:24.805
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

01:25:24.874 --> 01:25:28.708
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

01:25:28.778 --> 01:25:30.109
Agreed.

01:25:34.183 --> 01:25:37.209
Okay. Go work your magic.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.352
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

01:25:45.428 --> 01:25:47.055
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:48.825
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

01:25:48.898 --> 01:25:50.525
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.000
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

01:25:53.069 --> 01:25:56.435
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

01:25:56.505 --> 01:25:58.063
Okay, Abbie.

01:25:59.207 --> 01:26:02.836
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

01:26:02.911 --> 01:26:05.937
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.

01:26:06.014 --> 01:26:07.777
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

01:26:07.849 --> 01:26:10.181
To better sell your automobile.

01:26:10.252 --> 01:26:12.447
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

01:26:12.521 --> 01:26:14.455
Four reasons, actually.

01:26:14.523 --> 01:26:19.256
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

01:26:19.328 --> 01:26:21.990
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...

01:26:22.064 --> 01:26:25.659
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

01:26:25.734 --> 01:26:30.397
Actually, Zoë's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:32.200
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

01:26:33.007 --> 01:26:36.602
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

01:26:36.677 --> 01:26:39.077
And reason number four...
and the most important:

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:42.081
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:46.586
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

01:26:47.455 --> 01:26:48.615
Lee.

01:26:51.892 --> 01:26:54.019
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

01:26:54.095 --> 01:26:57.087
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

01:26:57.164 --> 01:26:58.153
Hmm.

01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:00.623
Why's she dressed like that?

01:27:00.701 --> 01:27:03.863
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

01:27:03.937 --> 01:27:06.872
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.601
What's a cheerleader movie?

01:27:08.675 --> 01:27:10.438
A movie about cheerleaders.

01:27:11.678 --> 01:27:12.906
Is it a porno movie?

01:27:14.681 --> 01:27:21.280
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:27.621
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

01:27:27.694 --> 01:27:30.424
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

01:27:30.497 --> 01:27:33.489
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

01:27:33.566 --> 01:27:34.897
Ta-ta!

01:27:45.244 --> 01:27:46.677
Gulp.

01:28:01.226 --> 01:28:02.659
You thinking what I'm thinking?

01:28:04.329 --> 01:28:05.728
I think I'm thinking it.

01:28:05.798 --> 01:28:07.288
What are you and you thinking?

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:10.699
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:15.464
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.871
I gotta take a...

01:28:34.192 --> 01:28:35.989
So, you ready to do this?

01:28:37.528 --> 01:28:38.586
You sure?

01:28:38.663 --> 01:28:43.327
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.834
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

01:28:45.902 --> 01:28:47.028
Kim!

01:28:47.104 --> 01:28:49.766
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.501
I'm just saying.

01:28:52.943 --> 01:28:54.570
You wanna start out on top?

01:28:56.012 --> 01:28:59.345
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

01:29:04.821 --> 01:29:06.015
Here are your gloves.

01:29:13.196 --> 01:29:15.721
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

01:29:15.799 --> 01:29:17.562
This is my jacket.

01:29:17.634 --> 01:29:20.932
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

01:29:22.037 --> 01:29:25.268
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

01:29:25.341 --> 01:29:27.832
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

01:29:37.153 --> 01:29:39.451
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

01:29:39.522 --> 01:29:40.716
Give me your belt.

01:29:45.161 --> 01:29:50.497
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

01:29:52.334 --> 01:29:54.164
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.

01:29:59.507 --> 01:30:02.305
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

01:30:02.377 --> 01:30:04.004
Come on, give her the belt.

01:30:04.078 --> 01:30:07.809
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?

01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:10.340
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

01:30:13.054 --> 01:30:14.954
It's nice to be nice, Kim!

01:30:15.023 --> 01:30:16.854
Whatever.

01:30:16.925 --> 01:30:21.328
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.

01:30:21.396 --> 01:30:23.830
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You'll ask "pretty please," bitch,

01:30:23.898 --> 01:30:26.764
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.

01:30:26.834 --> 01:30:28.768
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.

01:30:28.836 --> 01:30:30.827
Don't get on my nerves right now.

01:30:30.904 --> 01:30:33.338
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!

01:30:33.407 --> 01:30:35.500
You know, I ain't six.

01:30:48.455 --> 01:30:50.821
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

01:30:50.891 --> 01:30:52.085
KIM and ZOË: No.

01:30:53.627 --> 01:30:56.357
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.869
What the fuck are you guys doing?

01:31:19.085 --> 01:31:20.518
What does that mean?

01:31:22.555 --> 01:31:25.046
Whoa!

01:31:28.995 --> 01:31:32.362
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

01:31:39.671 --> 01:31:41.969
That fast enough for your bony ass?

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.769
Whoo-hoo!

01:31:43.842 --> 01:31:46.402
Whoa ho ho ho!

01:31:46.478 --> 01:31:47.467
Oh!

01:31:49.814 --> 01:31:52.305
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

01:31:56.955 --> 01:32:00.118
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

01:32:00.191 --> 01:32:01.783
Alrighty.

01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:04.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32:16.507 --> 01:32:17.974
Go, go! Go!

01:32:18.042 --> 01:32:20.738
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

01:32:35.125 --> 01:32:36.353
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:36.427 --> 01:32:38.395
Yah hoo hoo!

01:32:47.403 --> 01:32:49.496
Yah hoo hoo!

01:33:36.251 --> 01:33:39.948
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.

01:33:46.228 --> 01:33:46.956
Damn it!

01:33:55.936 --> 01:33:57.062
Now.

01:33:58.406 --> 01:34:00.738
Did you do something to him?
Say something?

01:34:00.808 --> 01:34:03.003
Nothing! Shit.

01:34:03.077 --> 01:34:04.874
Here he comes, Zoë.
He's coming!

01:34:04.945 --> 01:34:06.037
Aah!

01:34:08.282 --> 01:34:09.510
Shit, oh shit!

01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:11.016
No!

01:34:11.886 --> 01:34:13.251
Hold on, Zoë!

01:34:22.496 --> 01:34:24.429
Oh, my God. Zoë!

01:34:24.664 --> 01:34:26.859
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!

01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:32.399
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:34:34.107 --> 01:34:37.440
Zoë! Zoë!

01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:40.911
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.107
Whoa, whoa, get away!

01:34:45.452 --> 01:34:48.114
Oh, shit.
I can't see. I can't see!

01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:49.519
Zoë, move your leg!

01:34:53.293 --> 01:34:55.227
Oh! Come on, come on!

01:34:58.764 --> 01:35:02.291
Redneck lunatic bastard!
Get away from me!

01:35:02.367 --> 01:35:03.356
fucking legs!

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.965
Oh, my God.

01:35:20.219 --> 01:35:23.120
Shit, I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.

01:35:23.188 --> 01:35:24.621
I know, baby, just hold on.

01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:26.555
Watch your feet!

Oh, my God. Get away from us,

Get ready to fly, bitch.

Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?

01:39:00.365 --> 01:39:03.425
What was I thinking?
Zoë, the fucking cat!

01:39:07.539 --> 01:39:09.507
Whew. That was a close one.

01:39:12.877 --> 01:39:15.641
So, where's the maniac?

01:39:15.714 --> 01:39:18.581
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.

01:39:19.684 --> 01:39:21.948
You wanna go get him?

01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.045

Okay, get your ass in the back.
