<i>But before we talk about her,</i>
<i>I have to tell you something about me.</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:36.847
<i>And I'm sorry I have to tell you,</i>
<i>but I do.</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:40.350
<i>When I was a kid, my dad died.</i>

01:41.226 --> 01:43.812
<i>I know it's sad, but it's true,</i>
<i>and it happened.</i>

01:43.896 --> 01:46.857
<i>And it's something</i>
<i>you need to know about me.</i>

01:46.940 --> 01:50.527
<i>But here's the good news.</i>
<i>When he was alive, he was the best.</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.988
<i>He was funny and silly and...</i>

01:53.071 --> 01:56.992
<i>He had this amazing porcupine tie</i>
<i>he used to wear all the time.</i>

01:57.576 --> 02:00.954
<i>And when he died,</i>
<i>my mom let me wear it to his funeral.</i>

02:01.997 --> 02:05.500
<i>And after that,</i>
<i>I wore it pretty much every day.</i>

02:06.335 --> 02:08.878
<i>Fighting dinosaurs? Tie.</i>

<i>We were moving to Mica, Arizona.</i>

02:27.356 --> 02:32.110
<i>My mom said she got a good job there</i>
<i>and that it was quiet and far away.</i>

02:32.861 --> 02:36.823
<i>She said we could start fresh.</i>
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:54.216
<i>But guess what?</i>

02:54.299 --> 02:56.885
<i>Mica was quieter</i>
<i>than I ever could've imagined.</i>

02:56.969 --> 02:58.887
<i>Nothing ever happened here.</i>

02:58.971 --> 03:00.889
<i>Like, zero things.</i>

03:01.473 --> 03:04.852
<i>It was a town that felt like</i>
<i>something was missing.</i>

03:04.935 --> 03:06.436

03:06.520 --> 03:08.647
<i>-They just couldn't.</i>

<i>There were no trophies,</i>
<i>no celebrations, no stories.</i>

03:14.820 --> 03:18.240
<i>Because it had been that way for so long,</i>
<i>it just felt normal.</i>

03:18.323 --> 03:22.452
<i>And as the new kid, that meant I became</i>
<i>the center of attention real fast.</i>

03:30.419 --> 03:31.879
<i>And not in a good way.</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:38.093
<i>And right then, I knew.</i>

03:38.177 --> 03:41.388
<i>If I wanted to survive,</i>
<i>it was better to lay low.</i>

Maybe.

No.

KEVIN: Imagine being popular

06:49.993 --> 06:51.912
They're popular because they're beautiful.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.497
Yeah, Tess, that's not something you do.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.624

Something tastes different.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.961
Maybe she'll do <i>Hot Seat</i>

08:08.155 --> 08:09.573
That is terrible.
