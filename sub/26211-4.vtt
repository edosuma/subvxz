35:54.266 --> 35:55.667
- I'm gonna sit
in front of you.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.000
- How's everybody feeling?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.500
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, no, good. I just--

36:04.533 --> 36:06.166
- I miss you down there.
- I know.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.700
- You're all the way on the end.

36:07.734 --> 36:09.433
- We're all going to
New Zealand after this, right?

36:09.433 --> 36:11.700
- I wanted to go to Auckland
before going home.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.300
- Yeah, Chandler's
thinking of coming.

36:13.333 --> 36:15.033
- Oh, then I'm out.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.100
- So is Ashton.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.433
- Aw.
- Thank you.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.133
- Merci.
- Thank you.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.266
- Salute,
to another awesome charter.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.233
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Rhy.

36:24.033 --> 36:25.500
- Kate!
- I'm sorry.

36:25.533 --> 36:27.467
- Thank you.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.000
- Steak.
- Yep, steak.

36:30.033 --> 36:31.400
- Ah, that looks good.
- Beautiful.

36:31.433 --> 36:32.567
- Bon appétit everyone.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.033
- Oh, that's so good.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.567
- And I--

36:55.734 --> 36:57.066
[laughter]

36:57.066 --> 36:58.400
- Go have sex.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.700
Do things you shouldn't do.

36:59.734 --> 37:01.433
- What is this?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.000
- I could use
a very good (BLEEP).

37:05.734 --> 37:07.433
[laughing]

37:07.467 --> 37:09.033
- How long has it been?

37:09.066 --> 37:11.200
- I mean, like, early summer,
last summer.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.000
- Wow.
- Yeah, you're due.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.367
- Tonight's gonna be
a great night.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.667
- You think so?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.266
- Rhylee's naughty,

37:17.300 --> 37:18.734
and I've got to be careful
of that.

37:18.767 --> 37:20.600
Getting involved
with crew members,

37:20.600 --> 37:22.333
things get a lot more
complicated.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.333
[sighs]
(BLEEP).

37:27.333 --> 37:29.133
[laughter]

37:33.700 --> 37:35.100
- Are you guys going?

37:39.767 --> 37:41.233
What time would
we all like to head back

37:41.266 --> 37:42.633
to the boat tonight?

37:42.633 --> 37:44.233
- That's so cute.
I don't blame you

37:44.233 --> 37:46.100
for last time,
wanting to stay out.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.066
- It was not my intention
to piss everybody off.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.734
- I respect you more for that.

37:54.767 --> 37:56.233
- Hey.
- Hmm?

37:56.266 --> 37:57.767
- I'm gonna go smoke.
Do you want to come?

37:57.767 --> 37:59.500
- Is everyone's dinner okay?

37:59.533 --> 38:01.367
- Chandler, what do you think--
Oh.

38:01.367 --> 38:02.700
[laughter]

38:02.734 --> 38:04.367
Chandler's gone.
- Oh, where's Caroline?

38:04.400 --> 38:06.500
- Caroline, what'd you think--
oh.

38:06.533 --> 38:08.500
Oh, Caroline's gone as well.
[laughter]

38:08.500 --> 38:10.000
- You guys, if they have a--

38:10.033 --> 38:12.133
if they conceive
a baby this season

38:12.166 --> 38:15.000
I think it should be named
Seanna Kate.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.533
- Wait a minute,
I'm out of this conversation.

38:16.567 --> 38:19.333
Are we thinking they're
conceiving a baby right now?

38:19.367 --> 38:21.000
- Seanna Kate.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.333
- Oh, for (BLEEP) sakes.
- Seanna Kate.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.200
- Well, there you go.

38:26.233 --> 38:29.000
Caroline, he's my archnemesis.
Are you ----ing kidding me?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.533
(BLEEP) that.

38:30.567 --> 38:32.100
- Do you think we'd be
invited to the christening?

38:32.133 --> 38:34.000
I just don't want
to be the godmother.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.133
Chandler and Caroline.
I don't know if it's true,

38:36.133 --> 38:37.500
but it's funny.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.367
- Yeah, bye.
- Uber's here.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.233
- Get in. Get in.
- I'm going in this one.

38:43.266 --> 38:44.233
- Oh, God.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.667
[laughter]

38:52.600 --> 38:54.567
- [laughing]

38:55.433 --> 38:56.700
- Hey, guys.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.667
- [laughs] I got it.
I got it.

39:00.734 --> 39:02.000
- [gasps]

39:06.200 --> 39:07.633
- Oh, yes.

39:13.033 --> 39:14.266
- No, I honestly--

39:16.166 --> 39:17.500
- What are you talking about--

39:18.533 --> 39:20.166
Everyone thinks we like
each other.

39:21.266 --> 39:23.433
- It's--no, it's false.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.667
[soft laugh]

39:28.700 --> 39:31.000
- What is that?
- Peach cake.

39:31.033 --> 39:32.433
- Mmm.
- Oh, okay.

39:32.433 --> 39:34.066
I can--[laughs]

39:34.066 --> 39:35.333
That's really good.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.033
- I'm outtie.

39:37.066 --> 39:38.300
- Okay.
- [laughs]

39:38.333 --> 39:39.667
- Are we gonna go upstairs?

39:40.367 --> 39:42.734
- [soft chuckle]
Can I have another bite?

39:42.734 --> 39:44.066
- Okay, you have to--
[chuckles]

39:44.066 --> 39:45.700
Okay, here.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.433
- Mm.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.567
- The blue things are the best.
- Yeah.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.734
- [snickers]

39:53.767 --> 39:55.567
- See you later.
- Thank you.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.166
- No problem.

39:59.066 --> 40:02.467
- [laughing] I don't want
to smell your feet.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.600
- [farts]
- Oh, (BLEEP) off.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.200
Blast you, (BLEEP).
[groans]

40:07.200 --> 40:08.600
- Hey.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.700
- So you know that didn't help.

40:10.734 --> 40:12.166
- What?
- Him walking up

40:12.200 --> 40:14.300
sharing your cake with you.

40:14.333 --> 40:15.600
- I--uh...

40:15.633 --> 40:17.333
- I'm not saying anything
about you.

40:17.367 --> 40:18.500
- No, I'm not being defensive.
I just--

40:18.500 --> 40:20.066
I don't know what to say.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.066
- Because you saw him eat cake?

40:24.500 --> 40:25.633
- [scoffs]

40:25.667 --> 40:27.467
- I won't ----ing hate
you for it.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.100
both: Hey, guys.
- Oh, hello.

40:29.133 --> 40:32.066
- The Jacuzzi is--
both: So hot.

40:32.100 --> 40:35.200
- And these drinks are--
both: So cold.

40:35.233 --> 40:38.467
- Kate and Josiah,
they're just wasted!

40:38.500 --> 40:41.367
I'm pretty sure
that it started with this one.

40:41.367 --> 40:42.767
What you're talking about.
- No, I know.

40:42.767 --> 40:44.633
You already told me that.
- What is talking?

40:44.633 --> 40:46.500
- I watched her and Chandler
eat cake together

40:46.500 --> 40:48.233
like "Lady in the Tramp."
- Who?

40:48.266 --> 40:51.233
- She said we ate cake together
like "Lady in the Tramp."

40:51.233 --> 40:52.633
- Are you calling me a tramp?

40:52.667 --> 40:55.233
- Oh, my God.
- Who's calling her a tramp?

40:55.233 --> 40:57.000
- 'Cause I'm the lady.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.533
- Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.767
- Kate.
- They're so not fun.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.500
- Everyone's so boring.

41:13.533 --> 41:15.000
Ramen.

41:15.033 --> 41:16.667
- [gasps] Ramen!

41:16.700 --> 41:18.667
I love you, Ramen.

41:18.667 --> 41:21.066
- Ramen.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.667
- But seriously.

41:22.667 --> 41:25.400
Okay, if you could
fire anyone...

41:25.433 --> 41:27.333
- Oh, my God.

41:28.533 --> 41:31.000
- Rhylee.
- [laughs]

41:31.000 --> 41:32.500
- She's a moron.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.400
[knocking on door]

41:50.433 --> 41:52.300
- Come in.

41:52.333 --> 41:54.133
- Hi.
- Oh, great timing.

41:54.166 --> 41:55.300
Come on.

41:55.333 --> 41:56.633
- [sighs]

41:57.700 --> 42:00.266
- Come on in.
both: Come on in.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.767
- Nope.
- Okay, good night.

42:08.567 --> 42:11.033
- Hearing them
"Mean Girl" me behind my back

42:11.033 --> 42:13.166
is upsetting.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.300
I don't know why they feel like
they can treat me this way.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.333
It's become
a really ----ed up pattern.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.333
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:23.367 --> 42:25.300
Ashton, Ashton, Kate.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.700
Do you think the interior team
could take a ride on

42:26.734 --> 42:28.200
that thing when you're done
with it?

42:28.233 --> 42:30.066
-That is, if you aren't
all too busy.

42:30.066 --> 42:31.467
- What is wrong with that girl?

42:31.467 --> 42:33.200
- I do not give a (BLEEP).

42:33.200 --> 42:35.166
- Charles Yim.
He came up with

42:35.200 --> 42:36.667
a smartphone breathalyzer.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.066
- These people are
disgustingly obsessed

42:39.100 --> 42:41.200
with their social media
interaction.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.600
Darwin's coming for you,
Charles Yim.

42:42.633 --> 42:45.033
- Last night I--I heard
what you said.

42:45.066 --> 42:47.200
Do you mind just clearing off
this nightstand?

42:47.233 --> 42:48.734
- Oh, (BLEEP).
I didn't even see that.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.734
- [imitates gagging noises]

42:51.734 --> 42:53.333
- Everyone knows
that Rhylee is the fisherman.

42:53.367 --> 42:55.333
It doesn't make
any ----ing sense.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.033
- Sorry.

42:57.066 --> 43:00.166
- I was wondering
if I could go see a doctor.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.700
- I've got work to do.
Now, I've got extra work.

43:01.734 --> 43:03.467
What if she never comes back?

43:03.500 --> 43:06.033
- For more "Below Deck,"
