WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.475
I know you killed your grandmother

00:02.495 --> 00:03.759
- and we're gonna prove it.
- You're crazy.

00:03.784 --> 00:04.924
Troy didn't kill his grandmother.

00:04.947 --> 00:06.903
They have all kinds of
proof that he was at work.

00:06.913 --> 00:08.764
- Are you pregnant?
- Nobody else knows.

00:08.780 --> 00:11.638
I would support your right
to make your own decision.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.542
- She isn't pregnant anymore.
- You're screwing my brother!

00:14.556 --> 00:15.857
- That is not true!
- No, she's not!

00:15.867 --> 00:17.314
Why don't they talk about gay sex?

00:17.340 --> 00:19.032
How do you think that
would play with the parents?

00:19.062 --> 00:21.225
Gays and lesbians are really left out.

00:21.235 --> 00:23.454
I'm gonna make sure they
get informed off campus.

00:23.464 --> 00:26.030
- I wanna adopt you.
- Ana has a record, you know.

00:26.064 --> 00:27.291
They wouldn't let her move in here

00:27.303 --> 00:28.460
while Mike was fostering you.

00:28.479 --> 00:30.390
But now that he's adopting
you, that won't be an issue.

00:30.396 --> 00:33.253
- Can I help you?
- Could I maybe get you a cup of coffee?

00:33.304 --> 00:36.430
We are filing for divorce,
so we can freeze our assets.

00:36.462 --> 00:40.092
I see a beautiful woman with a
spirit 10 years younger than me.

00:40.130 --> 00:42.246
I'm sayin' this isn't a fling.

00:43.786 --> 00:46.227
I go every year, but
this is the first time

00:46.259 --> 00:49.478
- I've had a beautiful plus one on my arm.
- Stop it.

00:49.512 --> 00:51.629
Is Joshua Tree where Burning Man is?

00:51.629 --> 00:53.898
- No, it's in Nevada.
- How do you know that, Mom?

00:53.912 --> 00:55.542
- We're going next summer.
- So,

00:55.590 --> 00:58.194
what do people do
exactly at an RV rally?

00:58.210 --> 01:01.565
- Well, we do 'shrooms.
- Mother!

01:01.597 --> 01:03.539
- What? They're not drugs.
- Yes, they are.

01:03.553 --> 01:05.105
Don't get any ideas, you guys.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.962
I mean, mostly it's about
meeting other roadies.

01:07.988 --> 01:11.759
We share stories. We get
present with the Mother.

01:13.299 --> 01:14.776
- Earth.
- Mm.

01:14.814 --> 01:17.204
We have met some fascinating characters.

01:17.224 --> 01:18.994
And they have met you.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.467
- Should I tell 'em about our last night?
- Sure.

01:21.518 --> 01:23.998
Let's see, we were with
some... some good friends,

01:24.043 --> 01:25.941
and we're... around the campfire,

01:25.966 --> 01:29.788
underneath this canopy
of stars and, uh...

01:30.344 --> 01:32.575
I asked your mother to marry me.

01:32.632 --> 01:34.147
- Oh...
- Oh, my, God!

01:34.153 --> 01:36.669
When's the wedding? Am I a bridesmaid?

01:36.703 --> 01:38.986
Well, look, I mean, I
was hoping Vegas, but...

01:39.031 --> 01:41.648
- I love Vegas.
- Honey, you've never been to Vegas.

01:41.692 --> 01:44.294
Well, I... I've already
gotten married in Vegas once

01:44.301 --> 01:47.081
to Stef's dad, but
wherever we get married,

01:47.081 --> 01:50.628
I... I wouldn't wanna do
it without you all there.

01:50.635 --> 01:51.945
What we're thinkin' is we all

01:51.965 --> 01:53.927
just head down to the
courthouse together.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.985
Oh... gross, no. You
should have it here.

01:56.458 --> 01:57.999
Oh, no, no. No.

01:58.011 --> 02:00.240
- That's too much to ask.
- No, no, it's not.

02:00.266 --> 02:02.801
Mariana, love, I'm... I'm a
little busy with my new job.

02:02.807 --> 02:05.031
- Mom is not busy.
- Yes, I am, honey.

02:05.051 --> 02:06.902
I have to take Jesus to
physical therapy every day and...

02:06.948 --> 02:09.366
Well, I'm not going anymore.

02:09.487 --> 02:10.961
What? Yes you are.

02:10.978 --> 02:12.599
- No, I'm not.
- Jesus?

02:15.130 --> 02:18.684
Forget it, really. I
mean, you're too busy.

02:20.229 --> 02:22.428
I mean... I... I would
take care of everything.

02:22.548 --> 02:23.701
And I'll help.

02:25.541 --> 02:27.591
Sure, let's... let's do it.

02:27.591 --> 02:28.619
All right!

02:28.739 --> 02:31.784
So you just point me in the
direction of a good caterer,

02:31.815 --> 02:33.723
maybe some place to rent a chuppah.

02:33.748 --> 02:36.678
Ooh, and a florist. We need flowers.

02:38.436 --> 02:40.328
You're awfully quiet tonight.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.943
I know you're scared, Cal.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.512
I'm fine.

02:45.951 --> 02:48.416
You don't have to put
on a brave face for me,

02:48.436 --> 02:51.090
you know you're not
in this alone, my love.

02:52.829 --> 02:54.691
I am not gonna let you go to prison,

02:54.706 --> 02:56.531
and neither are Robert's lawyers.

02:56.572 --> 02:59.492
The burden of proof in
adult court is much higher,

02:59.559 --> 03:03.434
and they have no proof whatsoever
that you caused that accident.

03:08.145 --> 03:11.131
I just don't understand why
Troy wouldn't take the money,

03:11.157 --> 03:12.743
- if he's in debt.
- Well,

03:12.785 --> 03:14.905
the lawyers are looking
into Troy and his character,

03:14.911 --> 03:16.097
and they're gonna find something.

03:16.128 --> 03:17.969
He didn't become a liar overnight.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.065
I'll take care of the rest of this.

03:20.091 --> 03:21.595
You go get some sleep, all right?

03:23.123 --> 03:25.169
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.550
Hey, Ma. You guys settled in all right?

03:33.670 --> 03:37.175
Yeah. It's so great now that
you have the guest house.

03:37.231 --> 03:38.683
I'll have to come more often.

03:38.803 --> 03:41.792
Yeah, in that case, maybe we'll
convert it back to a garage.

03:41.843 --> 03:43.949
- Ha-ha, very funny.
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:43.949 --> 03:45.958
Listen, I need to talk
to you about something.

03:46.127 --> 03:47.145
Okay.

03:48.515 --> 03:50.975
Will wants to ask you
for my hand in marriage.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.275
And, uh, he wanted to do it before,

03:53.296 --> 03:54.732
but he didn't think you liked him.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.644
Okay. Well, I like him fine,

03:56.649 --> 03:58.577
so you can tell him
that he has my blessing.

03:58.607 --> 04:00.556
Well, I want you to tell
him that he doesn't...

04:00.934 --> 04:02.269
have your blessing.

04:03.432 --> 04:06.144
Because I really need
you to get me out of this.

04:49.010 --> 04:51.334
Why don't you wanna marry Will, Ma?

04:51.780 --> 04:52.873
Hmm.

04:53.364 --> 04:55.133
We're havin' such a good time,

04:55.163 --> 04:58.369
why ruin it by putting a ring on it?

04:59.014 --> 05:01.437
Why did you say yes in the first place?

05:01.483 --> 05:03.457
I didn't wanna say no
in front of our friends

05:03.468 --> 05:04.848
and humiliate him,

05:04.853 --> 05:06.490
and that's why I said
I wanted to do it here.

05:06.526 --> 05:09.460
You know, buy a little time.

05:09.698 --> 05:10.969
Make a plan.

05:10.984 --> 05:13.809
Okay, well, me breakin' the
news to him is not a plan,

05:13.876 --> 05:16.356
Ma, and it's not even an option, okay?

05:16.387 --> 05:18.639
You're a grown... woman,

05:18.759 --> 05:21.642
kind of, so you go talk to him.

05:23.011 --> 05:24.216
Ma?

05:25.113 --> 05:26.302
Okay.

05:27.953 --> 05:28.919
Fine.

05:29.410 --> 05:30.775
I'll go...

05:33.388 --> 05:35.122
break his heart...

05:36.391 --> 05:37.719
right now.

05:43.956 --> 05:46.517
_

05:47.084 --> 05:48.567
Hey, check it out.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.398
Hey, Foster.

05:50.428 --> 05:52.464
Can't wait for gay sex ed at your house.

05:52.525 --> 05:54.589
- Are your moms teaching?
- No.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.349
Are they gonna do a
little show-and-tell?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.579
I'd like to see some
girl-on-girl action!

06:01.534 --> 06:03.951
I mean, I make a mean cinnamon bun.

06:03.985 --> 06:06.473
You mean like in the tube
you whack on the counter?

06:06.488 --> 06:08.997
- Yeah.
- No, that's... that's not baking.

06:09.024 --> 06:11.164
What? You gotta cook
'em and watch 'em rise.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.127
Oh, you like watchin' those buns rise?

06:13.885 --> 06:16.144
- Hey, now.
- Hey.

06:16.264 --> 06:17.765
- There she is.
- Mm.

06:17.799 --> 06:20.834
You know Callie, my
girlfriend? Uh, this is Dawn.

06:20.869 --> 06:22.606
- She's on the girls' basketball team.
- Oh.

06:22.636 --> 06:25.024
- And we were just talkin' about the bake sale.
- Mm.

06:25.035 --> 06:28.235
Yeah, so we'll count on those
homemade cinnamon buns of yours, then?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.510
- You got it.
- Good.

06:29.544 --> 06:31.154
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

06:33.204 --> 06:35.541
She seems very interested in your buns.

06:35.571 --> 06:36.763
What?

06:36.961 --> 06:38.827
I was actually just tellin' her

06:38.863 --> 06:40.188
that there's nothin' as sweet as you.

06:40.221 --> 06:42.504
Ugh! Hey, maybe you guys can date

06:42.519 --> 06:44.227
when I'm in Los Colinas.

06:45.399 --> 06:46.759
Women's prison?

06:46.830 --> 06:48.640
Don't say things like that, Callie.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.202
I just hate all the waiting.

06:51.601 --> 06:53.167
Not knowing what's gonna happen.

06:55.704 --> 06:57.154
Is there anything I can do to help?

06:57.606 --> 06:59.036
Do you have plans after school?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.352
Nothing I can't change.

07:05.585 --> 07:07.508
Hey. Um...

07:07.682 --> 07:09.927
Jesus isn't feeling well right now.

07:09.993 --> 07:11.015
I know.

07:11.189 --> 07:13.669
He texted me. I just wanted to...

07:14.522 --> 07:15.756
give him this.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.157
Oh. Um...

07:18.593 --> 07:19.798
You know, he's...

07:19.918 --> 07:23.367
- really sorry.
- He's not the one who should be sorry.

07:23.837 --> 07:25.816
He's not just being paranoid.

07:25.856 --> 07:27.503
What he said... I mean,

07:27.508 --> 07:29.619
there is something
going on with you and me.

07:29.739 --> 07:32.135
We're not hooking up or
anything, but there's this...

07:32.753 --> 07:34.225
secret, and...

07:35.672 --> 07:38.428
I just can't face him and
not tell him the truth,

07:38.443 --> 07:39.870
so I've been avoiding him.

07:41.204 --> 07:42.912
So, I... I wrote him this.

07:42.912 --> 07:44.675
It doesn't say anything about you.

07:44.747 --> 07:46.705
He doesn't ever need to
know that you went with me,

07:46.736 --> 07:48.944
but I just can't tell him to his face.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.820
I mean, what if he freaks out, or...

07:50.851 --> 07:53.775
I... I... I think the
letter is a... good idea.

07:54.225 --> 07:55.508
Thanks.

07:58.602 --> 08:00.377
Will you give it to him?

08:02.964 --> 08:04.068
Yeah.

08:05.025 --> 08:06.277
Thanks.

08:08.511 --> 08:10.608
... treehouse was
constructed with permanence

08:10.618 --> 08:12.618
and sustainability in mind.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.187
The design allows for flexibility...

08:15.624 --> 08:16.816
Hey.

08:17.215 --> 08:19.935
So I, uh, I talked to Emma today.

08:20.055 --> 08:21.893
Yeah? What'd she say?

08:22.013 --> 08:25.125
Not much. She just, uh... she...

08:25.309 --> 08:26.745
wanted me to give you this.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.888
What do you think it's like a...

08:30.939 --> 08:33.208
- break-up letter or something?
- No.

08:35.101 --> 08:38.015
Um... did you want me to stay?

08:38.135 --> 08:40.434
No. Nah. I'm... I'm okay.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.489
- Thank you, though.
- Yeah.

09:08.885 --> 09:11.109
- Hey, love.
- Oh, hey.

09:11.352 --> 09:13.065
Hey, will you grab those
off the printer for me?

09:13.065 --> 09:14.956
Yeah, sure.

09:15.942 --> 09:17.417
Permission slips.

09:17.537 --> 09:20.083
Yeah, Monte's making me get
them for the sex ed class,

09:20.147 --> 09:22.248
even though it's not on campus.

09:22.282 --> 09:24.984
- Uh-oh, she's really, uh...
- Covering her ass?

09:25.018 --> 09:26.152
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

09:26.186 --> 09:28.084
Anyway, only two kids have
gotten them signed so far,

09:28.121 --> 09:30.008
so it looks like it's gonna
be a pretty small class.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.085
Why don't you guys just
hang a huge sign on the house

09:32.125 --> 09:33.600
that says "Gay virgin lives here."

09:33.632 --> 09:35.972
No, we thought about it,
but it's just too expensive.

09:37.621 --> 09:39.538
Sorry, buddy, I'm just kidding.

09:39.551 --> 09:42.139
What's going on? Is that what
kids are saying at school?

09:42.152 --> 09:45.578
No. They're just asking
me if you two are gonna...

09:45.757 --> 09:48.474
do it, you know, demonstrate.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.254
Do we have to have
the sex ed class here?

09:51.503 --> 09:55.402
Honey, I guess I could try to
find a community room somewhere.

09:55.434 --> 09:56.917
Okay.

09:57.037 --> 09:58.317
Oh, hey, you know,

09:58.355 --> 10:01.455
we also think that you should
invite Noah to the class.

10:01.461 --> 10:02.606
Why?

10:02.631 --> 10:06.217
Because you guys are dating and curious.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.768
It'd be good for him to have that
information, too, don't you think?

10:13.261 --> 10:16.501
- Okay.
- Great. One more thing to take care of.

10:16.507 --> 10:18.955
Well, I can look and see if there's
a room available at the station.

10:18.974 --> 10:22.740
All right? And speaking... of
work, I am on call this weekend.

10:22.746 --> 10:25.296
- Uh, what about the wedding?
- There's not gonna be a wedding, love.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.766
Oh, really?

10:29.898 --> 10:31.777
She hasn't told him yet?

10:31.809 --> 10:34.199
- I tried, I did try.
- Mom!

10:34.199 --> 10:36.723
- Obviously you didn't try hard enough.
- What can I say? He was...

10:36.761 --> 10:39.018
He was waiting for me
last night, you know...

10:39.312 --> 10:41.728
- in his birthday suit.
- Okay, Mom, uh, I...

10:41.753 --> 10:44.418
He seduced me and then I
couldn't tell him after sex.

10:44.431 --> 10:47.455
And this morning, he got up
and left before I woke up.

10:47.492 --> 10:48.841
Well, you have to tell him

10:48.854 --> 10:51.135
before he spends any more
money or time on this.

10:51.162 --> 10:53.903
Well, I can't tell him before dinner,
because he wants to cook for us,

10:53.932 --> 10:56.977
- and he's already shopped, so...
- Hope it's not gonna be tofurkey again.

10:57.002 --> 10:59.220
Well, I'm just glad someone
else is gonna cook for once.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.570
- Yeah.
- After dinner, Mom.

11:00.602 --> 11:04.149
Yeah, okay. I... I
know, I will, I promise.

11:04.188 --> 11:05.492
- Hey, Grandma.
- Hey.

11:05.511 --> 11:09.489
- It's gonna be so beautiful. Are you excited?
- Oh, you bet. Yeah.

11:10.685 --> 11:12.462
Okay, so...

11:12.519 --> 11:14.762
apparently, they invited a
bunch of their RV friends,

11:14.775 --> 11:16.456
so we're gonna have to call a caterer.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.889
- Oh, God.
- What? What's wrong?

11:21.103 --> 11:22.721
Scuba divin'?

11:22.912 --> 11:25.053
You got a new hobby
you wanna tell me about?

11:25.111 --> 11:26.619
Thinkin' about it.

11:28.045 --> 11:30.141
All right, come on, Callie,
what are we doin' here?

11:34.137 --> 11:37.895
Troy Johnson said he was working
here the day that Martha...

11:37.927 --> 11:40.676
No, Callie, no, no.
Your trial is comin' up.

11:40.695 --> 11:43.560
You need to be thinkin' about that,
not worryin' about some murder.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.051
Which is the reason why you got
into all this trouble to begin with.

11:46.062 --> 11:47.431
Well, that's not what I'm trying to do.

11:47.472 --> 11:49.109
I'm trying to prove that Troy is a liar.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.453
If he wasn't working here that day...

11:50.469 --> 11:52.422
But the manager confirmed
he was here, right?

11:52.468 --> 11:54.188
And there's security video of it, too?

11:54.190 --> 11:55.571
Yeah, we can't trust the
evidence in this case.

11:55.592 --> 11:57.718
Kyle had an alibi witness
and they shut him up.

11:57.838 --> 12:01.145
The only way we can know what
Vanessa Martin said is if we ask her.

12:03.921 --> 12:05.480
You're not talkin' to anybody.

12:21.030 --> 12:22.390
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.251
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.557
I was, uh, lookin' for Vanessa Martin.

12:26.614 --> 12:28.362
I, uh, used to work
here, and I was hopin'

12:28.367 --> 12:30.059
she could write me a
letter of recommendation.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.946
Yeah, she hasn't
worked here for a while.

12:32.324 --> 12:34.037
Uh, do you know where I could find her?

12:34.072 --> 12:36.215
I know where you could
reach her boyfriend.

12:36.251 --> 12:38.113
Hey, Troy. Someone to see you.

12:38.277 --> 12:41.084
This guy's looking for Vanessa,
says he worked here with her.

12:41.334 --> 12:44.685
- Oh, yeah? When was that?
- Uh... A few years ago.

12:44.999 --> 12:47.383
I've been here for five
years, I don't remember you.

12:47.396 --> 12:48.834
Yeah, well, I was part-time.

12:48.872 --> 12:51.742
I, uh, I was just hopin'
that she could, um,

12:51.862 --> 12:55.150
write me a letter of recommendation.
Uh, but it's... it's not a big deal.

12:55.156 --> 12:56.839
It's... it's okay. No, it's fine.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.132
Look, I'm sure she'd be happy
to do it. Why don't you, um,

12:59.252 --> 13:01.119
just give me your name and number,

13:01.151 --> 13:02.641
and I'll have her get a hold of you.

13:02.761 --> 13:05.076
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:11.416 --> 13:15.024
- All right. Thank you.
- Cool, thanks, Chris.

13:21.281 --> 13:23.653
Okay, so...

13:23.710 --> 13:25.794
Vanessa doesn't work here anymore.

13:26.407 --> 13:27.973
But guess who does?

13:28.312 --> 13:29.923
- No way, Troy?
- Yep.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.064
It's a good thing he
doesn't know who I am.

13:32.089 --> 13:34.243
- But you talked to him?
- Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.

13:34.287 --> 13:36.147
But, you know, when I asked
where I could reach Vanessa,

13:36.167 --> 13:38.170
they told me to talk to her boyfriend.

13:38.538 --> 13:40.577
- Troy's her boyfriend?
- Mm-hmm.

13:40.596 --> 13:42.456
He's dating his alibi?

13:43.900 --> 13:45.805
I told you to stay away
from me, you little bitch!

13:45.837 --> 13:47.576
Go! Callie! Callie! Drive!

13:47.576 --> 13:49.142
I got you on the security cameras!

13:49.193 --> 13:51.303
I'm gonna call the cops if
you ever come near me again!

13:51.360 --> 13:54.178
- Drive!
- You, too! This is harassment!

13:58.013 --> 14:00.103
Will, thank you so much for dinner.

14:00.142 --> 14:02.705
Oh, hey, I just wanted to
thank you all in advance,

14:02.730 --> 14:04.623
'cause I know this wedding
has been an inconvenience.

14:04.661 --> 14:07.160
- What is in this?
- Those are grilled carrots.

14:07.192 --> 14:08.387
It's crunchy.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.368
And listen, thanks for
letting us invite our friends,

14:10.394 --> 14:13.527
- you know, they were pretty insistent.
- Of course. Absolutely.

14:13.572 --> 14:16.441
And you kids, you have to invite
your significant others, okay?

14:16.447 --> 14:20.059
'Cause this is not just about
celebrating our love, it's our love.

14:20.704 --> 14:22.820
Oh, I almost forget. I have a surprise.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.645
- You're not the only one.
- You, uh, gonna invite Emma?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.486
Uh... yeah.

14:27.946 --> 14:30.101
- Probably.
- Why wouldn't he?

14:30.548 --> 14:31.731
I'm just asking.

14:31.851 --> 14:34.390
Jude, did you ask Noah
about class tomorrow?

14:34.510 --> 14:38.475
Yeah. Um... he's not
gonna be able to make it.

14:38.730 --> 14:41.535
Class on a Saturday?
What kinda class is that?

14:41.555 --> 14:44.545
It's LGBT sex ed, since they
don't teach it in schools.

14:44.545 --> 14:47.344
Oh. That sounds
interesting. Could I come?

14:47.383 --> 14:48.968
- No.
- No. Mom...

14:49.716 --> 14:51.684
Wow, champagne!

14:51.691 --> 14:54.765
Oh my gosh! What's the,
uh, special occasion?

14:54.790 --> 14:56.925
Uh... we're getting married tomorrow.

14:56.957 --> 14:58.325
Oh, well, yeah, that.

14:58.363 --> 14:59.776
- That's all.
- But, uh, heh...

15:00.204 --> 15:02.908
you know, tonight, what is
the special occasion tonight?

15:02.946 --> 15:04.896
This is like a rehearsal dinner,

15:04.902 --> 15:07.350
so I thought it appropriate
that I make a toast...

15:07.606 --> 15:10.355
to the woman who saw my RV...

15:10.375 --> 15:14.695
in her neighborhood,
and 48 hours later...

15:14.727 --> 15:16.542
I think it was less than 48 hours later,

15:16.568 --> 15:18.517
organized a campaign to kick me out.

15:18.536 --> 15:20.850
Well, how was I supposed to
know it wasn't a meth lab?

15:21.336 --> 15:24.359
You are... a force of nature.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.125
And, Sharon, there hasn't
been a day that's gone by

15:28.144 --> 15:31.621
that I haven't woken
up grateful for you,

15:31.877 --> 15:34.995
for your heart, and your
wit, and your beauty,

15:35.008 --> 15:37.175
and your compassion.

15:39.221 --> 15:41.304
And Stef, I know I should've
asked for your blessing

15:41.304 --> 15:42.992
before I popped the
question, but I am...

15:43.049 --> 15:44.731
asking for it now.

15:46.398 --> 15:48.041
Okay.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.777
Yes.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.381
Thank you.

15:54.501 --> 15:56.625
Sharon, thanks to your...

15:56.669 --> 16:00.217
your strict adherence to
neighborhood zoning laws,

16:00.249 --> 16:05.553
you've given this wandering
heart a home. And...

16:06.045 --> 16:08.705
I'm so lucky to get to travel this life

16:08.724 --> 16:11.376
- with the likes of you.
- Thank you.

16:12.635 --> 16:14.955
Hm. This is delicious.

16:14.955 --> 16:16.674
Ooh, I forgot the bottle.

16:18.074 --> 16:20.528
How could I not marry that man?

16:20.803 --> 16:22.401
So you're in?

16:22.521 --> 16:24.734
- I would be a fool not to be.
- Yes!

16:24.740 --> 16:26.901
- All right, who wants a refill?
- Uh, me, right here.

16:26.926 --> 16:28.179
- There you go.
- Me next.

16:28.211 --> 16:30.148
- All right.
- That's great.

16:35.759 --> 16:37.510
Knock, knock.

16:39.812 --> 16:42.624
I got a bunch of meds
your mom sent up for you.

16:42.744 --> 16:44.937
I tell you, with all
those prescriptions,

16:44.976 --> 16:47.769
- you'd fit in with some of my friends.
- Hmm.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.837
So what do you got there?

16:52.568 --> 16:56.119
- It's a letter from Emma.
- Hm?

16:56.239 --> 16:59.961
Yeah, I just, I...
kind of have a headache,

17:00.081 --> 17:02.237
and my eyes are tired.
I've been trying to read it,

17:02.269 --> 17:04.237
- but I can't really focus.
- Aw,

17:04.262 --> 17:05.593
I'm sorry.

17:05.989 --> 17:08.999
I could read it for you
if it's not too personal.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.479
No... Yeah-yeah.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.545
All right. Let's see
what Miss Emma has to say.

17:18.478 --> 17:22.141
"Hey!" What is it with
you kids and "hey"?

17:22.192 --> 17:24.218
What happened to the
old "Dear," you know?

17:24.242 --> 17:27.478
"Dear... Dear Jesus."

17:27.598 --> 17:29.894
I'm not gonna editorialize anymore.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.880
"First I wanna say I love you." Awww.

17:32.938 --> 17:35.424
"Even when we were just
friends with benefits."

17:37.754 --> 17:41.655
"Even when we were just friends
with benefits, I loved you."

17:41.687 --> 17:44.611
- Oh, so far not so bad, huh?
- I feel like...

17:44.921 --> 17:47.931
- there... there's a "but" coming, though.
- Hmm.

17:49.088 --> 17:53.300
"But things have been hard, with
all that you're going through.

17:53.543 --> 17:56.170
I'm sorry I pulled
away the other day, but

17:56.189 --> 17:58.285
it wasn't you. It's me.

18:00.425 --> 18:03.845
_

18:11.929 --> 18:14.019
- Is that it?
- These...

18:14.045 --> 18:16.978
These, uh, progressive lenses, they are

18:17.029 --> 18:18.979
just a nightmare.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.974
Here it is.

18:23.498 --> 18:26.949
"I'm just trying to deal with
everything the best I can.

18:27.556 --> 18:30.649
And if you wanna talk about
it, I'm totally willing.

18:31.757 --> 18:33.889
I hope you understand."

18:39.367 --> 18:41.521
I thought she was
gonna break up with me.

18:41.553 --> 18:42.870
Mm-hm.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.580
No, I think she's just
looking for a little...

18:46.871 --> 18:49.076
reassurance from you.

18:49.249 --> 18:50.565
Yeah.

18:50.591 --> 18:53.557
But I think you're gonna wanna
look at that letter yourself...

18:54.522 --> 18:56.522
when you feel a little better.

19:00.229 --> 19:01.737
Thanks.

19:20.145 --> 19:21.890
I read your letter.

19:22.471 --> 19:25.181
And you have nothing to be sorry for.

19:25.629 --> 19:27.674
I'm not mad at you.

19:28.262 --> 19:30.314
I totally understand.

19:30.935 --> 19:33.907
And we definitely don't
need to talk about this.

19:34.737 --> 19:36.904
And I love you, too.

19:42.822 --> 19:45.161
I should've just canceled this class.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.951
- Why?
- I've only got three kids,

19:46.964 --> 19:49.482
- and that's assuming the other two show.
- Listen, the point is to do it for Jude.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.711
Right? And maybe with fewer
kids, they'll ask more questions.

19:52.768 --> 19:53.906
Huh?

20:03.248 --> 20:05.976
Oh my... No. Hey, are you
guys all here for sex ed?

20:06.002 --> 20:07.721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:08.035 --> 20:11.103
Okay, well, I only have
two signed permission slips.

20:11.135 --> 20:12.777
So do the rest of you have yours?

20:12.897 --> 20:15.992
Well... I... I didn't
really ask my parents.

20:16.012 --> 20:18.562
They don't know about me,
they'd totally freak out.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.831
Hang tight, one second.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.327
Hey. What are you doing here?

20:24.340 --> 20:27.638
Um, your mom sent my
mom a permission slip.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.799
- Do you not want me here?
- N... No, of course I do.

20:30.831 --> 20:33.662
I just didn't think that

20:33.701 --> 20:36.577
this would be something
that you'd be interested in.

20:36.628 --> 20:38.111
Why not?

20:40.284 --> 20:42.221
What are you gonna do?

20:42.706 --> 20:44.502
How can I turn them away?

20:44.867 --> 20:47.103
Kids who can't come
out to their parents?

20:47.223 --> 20:48.867
They need this more anybody.

20:50.266 --> 20:52.171
What if Monte finds out?

20:54.594 --> 20:56.217
Rule number one:

20:56.805 --> 20:58.550
When partners are responsible,

20:58.588 --> 21:02.627
and when they respect
each other, sex is natural,

21:02.678 --> 21:04.972
healthy and pleasurable.

21:05.004 --> 21:06.672
And today we're gonna talk about it,

21:06.704 --> 21:11.019
without judgment, fear or shame.

21:11.607 --> 21:14.841
So, who wants to break the ice?

21:20.413 --> 21:21.820
Yes?

21:22.114 --> 21:25.840
Um... what if two partners...

21:26.364 --> 21:27.963
you know, uh...

21:28.857 --> 21:31.755
- wanna play the same position?
- Fantastic question.

21:31.786 --> 21:36.997
Sometimes partners have sexual
likes that might not perfectly align.

21:46.656 --> 21:48.088
Hi.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.463
Come in.

21:53.671 --> 21:56.815
You, uh, you look really... really nice.

21:56.825 --> 21:59.321
Thanks.

21:59.441 --> 22:02.212
Is that... that what you're wearing?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.787
No. No, I haven't...
I haven't dressed yet.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.830
Are we... good?

22:10.488 --> 22:11.646
Yeah.

22:11.857 --> 22:15.596
Yeah, of course. I was gonna ask
you, I mean, are you really...

22:16.210 --> 22:18.249
- you okay?
- Yeah.

22:19.022 --> 22:21.074
Especially if you are.

22:25.446 --> 22:27.286
Thanks for, uh, doin' this.

22:27.293 --> 22:30.399
The guy I usually play music with
kind of just broke up with my sister.

22:30.418 --> 22:31.984
No worries.

22:31.990 --> 22:34.924
I'm honored you asked. I do
have to leave by six, though.

22:34.962 --> 22:38.471
I'm doing this, uh... stand-up
at this open mic night,

22:38.510 --> 22:40.498
and you have to sign up
really early to get onstage.

22:40.517 --> 22:43.342
Stand-up? Like... comedy?

22:43.462 --> 22:46.142
- Yeah.
- Aren't you scared you're gonna like...

22:46.262 --> 22:49.778
- bomb?
- Yeah. That's the point.

22:50.021 --> 22:53.389
I read this book, My Year with Eleanor.

22:53.509 --> 22:57.282
And it's based on that thing
Eleanor Roosevelt supposedly said:

22:57.576 --> 23:00.081
"You should do one thing
a day that scares you."

23:00.100 --> 23:02.593
So, I'm following her advice.

23:02.657 --> 23:05.860
One thing a day, bungee
jumping, skydiving...

23:05.917 --> 23:07.048
And stand-up comedy.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.511
- Yeah.
- Right.

23:08.914 --> 23:11.381
So you're like a... a masochist?

23:11.407 --> 23:15.931
No. I just, you know, I
like to challenge myself.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.254
Feel like I'm really living.

23:18.289 --> 23:20.237
I had sort of a sheltered childhood.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.317
Um, you know what?
I'll... I'll be right back.

23:26.349 --> 23:29.201
Cool.

23:29.321 --> 23:31.035
Hey. Everything okay?

23:31.048 --> 23:33.829
- What did Jesus say about the letter?
- Just that he's...

23:33.841 --> 23:35.906
not mad and he understands.

23:36.026 --> 23:37.958
Well, that... that's good, right?

23:38.078 --> 23:40.892
Here comes the bride, almost!

23:40.918 --> 23:43.334
Hey, Grandma! Hey, Grandma,
you know Emma, right?

23:43.347 --> 23:46.703
- Jesus's girlfriend?
- Oh, yes, of course, I remember you.

23:46.715 --> 23:48.908
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

23:48.965 --> 23:51.503
- Congratulations.
- Why, thank you.

23:52.992 --> 23:55.204
You know, I could use a
little help with my dress.

23:55.229 --> 23:57.268
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

23:57.281 --> 23:58.795
Perfect.

24:07.853 --> 24:09.463
Oh, my God, you scared me.

24:09.527 --> 24:11.962
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.656
What you lookin' at?

24:15.871 --> 24:18.647
Vanessa accepted
Mariana's friend request.

24:19.076 --> 24:20.840
Troy's girlfriend Vanessa?

24:21.933 --> 24:24.029
I didn't think she'd friend me.

24:26.356 --> 24:27.953
I'm gonna get something to drink.

24:28.312 --> 24:29.890
I'll be downstairs.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.598
Honey, do you really think this is
a good time to go through the mail?

24:43.718 --> 24:46.472
This is your mother's wedding,
you've barely lifted a finger.

24:46.497 --> 24:48.230
Well, I didn't think there
was going to be a wedding.

24:48.246 --> 24:49.913
And I'm only going
through the mail because I

24:49.928 --> 24:51.800
thought I saw something important.

24:51.805 --> 24:54.050
Turned out, it was our divorce papers.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.824
It's official, we're no longer married.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.353
Which right about now,
you're probably happy about.

24:57.731 --> 25:00.385
- Congratulations.
- I am not happy. I hate that we had to

25:00.505 --> 25:02.384
get a divorce just to keep our house.

25:02.415 --> 25:04.210
Well, you know, we had no choice.

25:04.245 --> 25:05.994
Duh, they were gonna sue us.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.086
We'll... We'll get married
again, you know, great.

25:08.106 --> 25:11.286
You know, I am not throwing
another wedding, ever again.

25:12.197 --> 25:14.202
We can go to the courthouse,
I'll wear flannel.

25:14.222 --> 25:15.485
Honey, we are married.

25:15.485 --> 25:17.239
Why do we need another
piece of paper to prove it?

25:17.254 --> 25:18.593
Besides, it's just one more thing to put

25:18.614 --> 25:20.516
on our never-ending to-do list.

25:20.552 --> 25:23.031
Will you unwrap this? I have
to get some more platters.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.420
Ohh! Wow!

25:32.456 --> 25:34.220
Wanna zip me up there?

25:34.340 --> 25:35.313
I...

25:35.697 --> 25:37.839
love your dress.

25:38.463 --> 25:40.125
You don't think I'm
too old to pull it off?

25:40.165 --> 25:41.520
Not at all.

25:42.293 --> 25:43.510
Thank you.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.280
Listen, I wanted to tell you that, um...

25:49.344 --> 25:52.202
Jesus asked me to read the
letter that you wrote him.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.883
- Why?
- Not for me. He asked me

25:56.918 --> 26:00.222
to read it because his head
hurt and his eyes were tired,

26:00.238 --> 26:02.380
and... I didn't read all of it.

26:02.671 --> 26:05.039
I mean, I...

26:05.159 --> 26:08.168
I did, but not out loud.

26:08.839 --> 26:11.932
I skipped over the part with the...

26:13.425 --> 26:15.209
I just want to tell you that I,

26:15.485 --> 26:17.433
I support your choice.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.371
Do your parents know?

26:22.864 --> 26:24.699
I was gonna tell my mom,

26:25.292 --> 26:28.073
but she'd maybe wanna
talk to Stef and Lena,

26:28.088 --> 26:30.333
and I didn't know if
Jesus and okay with that.

26:30.901 --> 26:33.595
Yeah, I wanted to tell him, you know?

26:34.010 --> 26:35.416
I'm sure you did.

26:35.718 --> 26:38.157
But I can understand why you couldn't.

26:39.318 --> 26:41.501
You don't have to worry about me, okay?

26:41.501 --> 26:44.170
I mean, I wasn't even
supposed to see that, so...

26:45.628 --> 26:47.934
I would never tell anyone.

26:48.782 --> 26:51.477
I just needed to know
that you were okay.

26:52.014 --> 26:53.154
Thank you.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.030
Mm-hm. Yeah.

27:02.077 --> 27:04.245
Almost as cute as your disco outfit.

27:06.304 --> 27:07.511
Damn.

27:07.905 --> 27:10.192
- Is it gonna rain?
- I hope not.

27:11.394 --> 27:12.577
So, um...

27:13.089 --> 27:14.725
what'd you think of the class?

27:15.658 --> 27:17.198
Um...

27:18.515 --> 27:20.170
I don't know.

27:21.915 --> 27:23.583
You, um...

27:24.798 --> 27:27.296
- you asked a lot of questions.
- I did?

27:27.341 --> 27:30.235
About stuff that I
figured you already knew.

27:32.704 --> 27:35.424
I don't know everything.

27:36.171 --> 27:39.346
But you've had sex with three people.

27:41.115 --> 27:43.451
Well, not sex, sex.

27:43.733 --> 27:45.784
Other stuff can be sex, too.

27:48.938 --> 27:51.993
- So you... haven't...
- No.

27:55.656 --> 27:59.565
- Do you want to?
- Maybe, someday. But, like...

28:01.155 --> 28:02.986
I'm not, like, ready.

28:03.538 --> 28:04.490
Are you?

28:05.006 --> 28:06.100
No.

28:06.657 --> 28:07.669
Well...

28:08.319 --> 28:10.676
do you wanna do some...

28:11.131 --> 28:12.742
other stuff?

28:16.592 --> 28:19.174
Hey, um... have you seen Grandma?

28:19.225 --> 28:21.245
No. Hey, did you know it was gonna rain?

28:21.291 --> 28:23.592
Yeah. That's why I
planned an outdoor wedding.

28:23.807 --> 28:25.146
It's not gonna rain.

28:26.076 --> 28:27.774
Oh, look, there's Will.

28:29.712 --> 28:31.870
- Hey!
- Hey.

28:32.269 --> 28:34.365
Uh, skies look a little ominous.

28:34.396 --> 28:35.776
Well, how was I supposed to know?

28:35.843 --> 28:38.082
- It rains like one day out of the year!
- It's okay. I'm just sayin'

28:38.082 --> 28:39.841
I think maybe we should
get the show on the road.

28:40.639 --> 28:42.838
Already on it. Have you seen the bride?

28:42.864 --> 28:45.114
No, I can't, that's bad luck.

28:45.395 --> 28:46.669
Right.

28:56.053 --> 28:58.901
So, I know you said that we
don't need to talk about it,

28:58.922 --> 29:01.878
but you read all of my letter, right?

29:01.998 --> 29:05.420
Yourself? I mean, obviously,
you read it yourself.

29:05.431 --> 29:08.074
Can we please just
stop talking about it?

29:09.444 --> 29:10.871
- Yeah.
- We're good.

29:12.206 --> 29:13.397
Yeah.

29:14.706 --> 29:17.707
- I don't see our cards.
- Yeah, me neither.

29:18.535 --> 29:20.401
I hope we're sitting together.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.557
Okay, so I found Grandma.

29:37.577 --> 29:40.006
And you need to come upstairs, like now.

29:42.353 --> 29:44.256
So are you mad at me?

29:45.498 --> 29:47.538
Not everything's about you, Callie.

29:48.678 --> 29:51.736
I just found out the only
reason Mike wants to adopt me...

29:52.328 --> 29:53.883
is so Ana can move in.

29:54.046 --> 29:55.560
What do you mean?

29:57.789 --> 30:00.560
Because she has a record
that won't let her move in if

30:00.897 --> 30:02.160
he's fosterin' me.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.732
First of all, I don't think
that's the only reason.

30:06.675 --> 30:08.009
Why didn't you tell me?

30:08.044 --> 30:10.551
'Cause all we do is
talk about you, Callie.

30:12.315 --> 30:15.025
Sorry, I might be going to jail, so...

30:15.578 --> 30:16.958
Who's fault is that?

30:17.320 --> 30:18.906
You keep messin' with Troy Johnson,

30:18.921 --> 30:21.317
- what do you think is gonna happen?
- You saw him, he's crazy.

30:21.338 --> 30:25.025
- Yeah... exactly.
- Yeah, and so I need to prove it.

30:26.009 --> 30:27.843
Vanessa was married four years ago.

30:27.856 --> 30:30.042
What if she was having
an affair... with Troy?

30:30.055 --> 30:32.408
She might not talk to us,
but her ex-husband might.

30:32.408 --> 30:34.216
You really can't help yourself, can you?

30:34.336 --> 30:36.012
You're your own worst enemy.

30:37.219 --> 30:38.862
I thought you wanted to help me.

30:40.646 --> 30:43.797
I'm a black man in America,
Callie, with a juvenile record.

30:43.917 --> 30:46.475
And I don't have a rich daddy
to buy me the best lawyers.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.744
If I make trouble and get
arrested, I'm goin' down.

30:48.917 --> 30:51.218
Just like Ty. That's it.

30:52.754 --> 30:54.639
I'd do anything for you, but I'm not

30:54.664 --> 30:56.524
gonna follow you down a rabbit hole.

31:11.256 --> 31:14.240
What, uh... what's goin' on, Ma?

31:15.327 --> 31:17.046
I can't do it.

31:17.954 --> 31:19.961
I... I... I can't get married.

31:20.081 --> 31:22.537
Okay, well, it's a... it's a
little late for cold feet, Ma,

31:22.543 --> 31:25.356
- don't ya think?
- I've tried, I have really tried.

31:25.913 --> 31:27.713
I've tried so hard.

31:28.664 --> 31:32.279
But the heart just... doesn't
want what the heart doesn't want.

31:34.743 --> 31:35.745
Hey.

31:35.865 --> 31:37.366
Everything okay in here?

31:38.271 --> 31:40.588
Not really.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.187
Hey, can you guys play a
song or something, like,

31:44.218 --> 31:46.320
- entertain the crowd?
- What... What's the holdup?

31:46.366 --> 31:47.997
Just... please do it.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.193
Well, we... we only
know one song together.

31:58.245 --> 32:02.801
So... "For Once in My Life"
on repeat or we improv?

32:03.415 --> 32:06.283
Uh, actually, I've... got an idea.

32:06.785 --> 32:09.545
Why don't you do your,
uh, stand-up routine?

32:09.855 --> 32:12.843
- Here?
- Yeah. There's an open mic, over there.

32:14.593 --> 32:16.847
- Um...
- Do it.

32:17.297 --> 32:18.262
Uh...

32:18.297 --> 32:20.437
Are you sure, Ma?

32:21.894 --> 32:25.504
I mean, just last night, you said
how could I not marry this man,

32:25.537 --> 32:27.841
- didn't you?
- This doesn't have anything to do with Will.

32:28.004 --> 32:30.377
He's not the reason I
don't wanna get married.

32:31.395 --> 32:33.517
- It's your father.
- Dad?

32:33.552 --> 32:35.777
No offense, but I loved your father.

32:35.897 --> 32:38.635
- Why would I take offense to that, Ma?
- Let me finish.

32:39.818 --> 32:41.722
I loved your father...

32:42.419 --> 32:44.253
until I married him.

32:44.373 --> 32:45.697
And then...

32:46.017 --> 32:48.822
moment by moment, hour
by hour, day by day,

32:48.835 --> 32:50.982
- week by week, year by year,
- I get it...

32:51.021 --> 32:53.455
I started to hate his guts.

32:53.462 --> 32:57.341
All I could think about
was ways to kill him.

32:57.967 --> 33:02.019
Stabbing him in his sleep.
Pushing him off a cliff.

33:02.358 --> 33:04.876
- Castrating him...
- Now I'm startin' to get a little offended.

33:04.876 --> 33:06.666
Who is it?

33:06.675 --> 33:08.284
- Oh...
- It's Will.

33:08.662 --> 33:10.355
Tell him I'm not here.

33:14.983 --> 33:16.459
Everything okay?

33:18.576 --> 33:20.749
Ma, you just asked "Who is it?"

33:21.113 --> 33:24.117
- Pretty sure he knows you're here.
- I'll deny it.

33:29.792 --> 33:31.249
Hey.

33:32.349 --> 33:35.116
I think that if you
don't wanna marry him...

33:36.082 --> 33:39.162
you at least owe it to him
to go out there and tell him.

33:39.207 --> 33:41.233
Honey, everything okay?

33:45.074 --> 33:47.075
Hi. I'm Grace.

33:47.324 --> 33:51.869
I don't know the bride, or
groom, or anyone, really,

33:51.869 --> 33:54.233
- except for Brandon. Hi.
- Woo!

33:54.948 --> 33:56.259
Anyway,

33:57.250 --> 33:59.723
does anybody know why
they call it Twitter?

33:59.843 --> 34:02.369
It's kind of a misnomer,
right? Birds don't type.

34:04.350 --> 34:07.194
So Jesus didn't read my letter.

34:07.405 --> 34:09.967
- What? What?
- He definitely didn't read it.

34:10.551 --> 34:12.219
How do you know?

34:12.507 --> 34:14.686
Because he can't read.

34:14.864 --> 34:16.257
I'm not kidding.

34:17.453 --> 34:19.248
But, seriously, I cannot

34:19.369 --> 34:22.449
do social media anymore,
now that my nana's on it.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.828
She is the insta-grandma.

34:26.393 --> 34:29.212
And mercifully, that's my
cue that God's had enough.

34:29.251 --> 34:31.646
- I am not kidding.
- I'll explain later.

34:31.940 --> 34:34.031
Thank you so much, and don't worry,

34:34.070 --> 34:35.683
I won't be here all week.

34:37.188 --> 34:38.553
Yeah!

34:38.587 --> 34:41.252
I told you I wasn't funny.

34:41.264 --> 34:43.094
And you weren't
kidding, but, uh, that...

34:43.214 --> 34:45.326
took some serious guts.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.005
What was that?

34:55.003 --> 34:56.904
My one scary thing for tomorrow.

35:00.889 --> 35:03.056
I just don't ever wanna hate you.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.239
Sharon, there's tons of married
people that don't hate each other.

35:08.297 --> 35:11.596
I know, but... but
what we have is so good.

35:11.716 --> 35:14.177
Why would we wanna risk ruining it by...

35:14.746 --> 35:18.237
making promises we
maybe can't even keep?

35:19.745 --> 35:21.279
Well...

35:22.416 --> 35:25.805
I mean, I actually was gonna
address that in my vows.

35:28.425 --> 35:30.330
You wrote vows for me?

35:30.752 --> 35:32.144
Course.

35:32.784 --> 35:35.193
What do you think, I'm gonna
disrespect a woman as unique

35:35.193 --> 35:37.283
and special as you with... with some,

35:37.403 --> 35:39.942
what, old-fashioned
cookie-cutter script?

35:40.574 --> 35:42.953
Look, to me,

35:43.266 --> 35:47.619
marriage isn't a contract, and...
and promises aren't always broken.

35:47.739 --> 35:49.600
Especially when they're easy to keep.

35:49.720 --> 35:54.687
Like loving you, every day, and
never taking you for granted.

35:54.924 --> 35:59.085
And promising that if, for some
reason, you fall out of love with me,

35:59.117 --> 36:00.671
or if I fall out of love with you,

36:00.715 --> 36:04.033
I'll never forget you're my best friend.

36:12.719 --> 36:14.157
Mm.

36:15.850 --> 36:17.505
Should I be worried?

36:18.637 --> 36:20.989
That you don't wanna remarry me?

36:23.488 --> 36:25.226
Honey...

36:25.796 --> 36:28.928
It's not that I don't
wanna remarry you, come on.

36:28.947 --> 36:31.746
It's just... our
wedding was so beautiful.

36:31.797 --> 36:33.875
It was the happiest day of my life.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.572
Anything we do now would
just pale in comparison.

36:36.585 --> 36:39.915
Look, we don't have to try
and recreate that day, love.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.900
Look, I... I know that I
was the one that didn't...

36:42.932 --> 36:45.732
think that a piece of paper
was necessary last time,

36:45.732 --> 36:47.540
but I love being married.

36:47.911 --> 36:49.982
I like our marriage being...

36:49.988 --> 36:51.835
recognized by the federal government.

36:51.854 --> 36:53.676
I know we don't need anybody's
permission to love one another,

36:53.714 --> 36:55.835
but you know what, it feels good to have

36:55.870 --> 36:58.338
the same rights as
every straight couple.

36:58.732 --> 37:00.534
To be included.

37:01.257 --> 37:03.250
To be protected under the law.

37:03.282 --> 37:05.960
God knows that right might be
taken away from us, but, man,

37:06.024 --> 37:07.999
as long as we have it, I want it.

37:08.043 --> 37:10.120
You know, I wanna be equal. I want

37:10.171 --> 37:12.933
our love and our family
to be out and be proud,

37:12.952 --> 37:14.748
and if they try to take
marriage away from us,

37:14.755 --> 37:18.278
then you're damn right I'm gonna
fight to keep it, because, you know,

37:18.398 --> 37:20.801
us getting married again,
that... that piece of paper,

37:20.840 --> 37:23.172
that's about more than just us, babe.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.528
I know that we...

37:26.648 --> 37:29.636
have had some rough times
since we got married.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.111
But, you know, all these politics aside,

37:33.123 --> 37:35.635
if I were to ask you
today for the first time...

37:38.332 --> 37:40.339
would you marry me?

37:47.043 --> 37:53.032
♪ For once in my life I
have someone who needs me ♪

37:53.083 --> 37:57.225

37:57.666 --> 38:03.873

38:12.941 --> 38:15.012
Grandma... What's going on?

38:15.677 --> 38:17.275

♪ Someone who needs me ♪

38:35.017 --> 38:39.134
Well, this is a... bit of a surprise.

38:39.339 --> 38:43.199
We come together today in front
of your family and friends.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.478
Well...

38:44.510 --> 38:46.663
... mostly Sharon and Will's friends.

38:46.715 --> 38:50.076
- You sure you're okay with this?
- You're not goin' anywhere, are you?

38:50.120 --> 38:52.415
No. I'm not going anywhere.

38:52.434 --> 38:54.127
Yeah, I'm okay.

38:54.162 --> 38:56.627
As these two fell in
love on the open road

38:56.652 --> 38:59.004
explorin' the country by RV...

38:59.011 --> 39:01.446
Yeah, no, that doesn't really apply.

39:01.566 --> 39:05.019
Meeting new friends in every
corner of the good ol' USA.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.911
No.

39:07.031 --> 39:10.803
Uh, ooh... Making love under
the stars on a cool desert night.

39:10.829 --> 39:13.136
We have kids here, that
was, that's... Yeah.

39:13.256 --> 39:16.632
I think I'm gonna just get a little, uh,

39:16.684 --> 39:18.601
less specific.

39:19.029 --> 39:23.127
They say on the road, there
are three types of folks:

39:23.523 --> 39:26.636
hitchhikers, day trippers,

39:26.674 --> 39:28.937
and those who are in
it for the long haul.

39:29.057 --> 39:31.807
I think if you have any vows,

39:31.820 --> 39:33.629
you might wanna spit 'em out now.

39:33.673 --> 39:36.862
- Uh...
- Okay, I... I didn't really prepare anything,

39:36.882 --> 39:40.212
but, um... of course I
would marry you again today.

39:40.332 --> 39:42.295
I am marrying you today.

39:42.863 --> 39:45.804
No matter how hard life gets,

39:45.924 --> 39:48.437
or what challenges we face...

39:49.996 --> 39:53.876
my love for you has only gotten
stronger over this past year.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.603
And I know that no
matter what happens...

39:58.012 --> 39:59.923
it always will.

40:02.063 --> 40:04.926
Okay, I think I'm gonna say
"ditto" to what she said,

40:04.965 --> 40:07.151
if that's okay with
everybody, 'cause we gotta...

40:07.196 --> 40:10.302
That's great. Great. Uh,
yeah, okay, so... uh...

40:10.341 --> 40:12.673
By the power vested in me
by the State of California,

40:12.679 --> 40:14.022
and a bunch of other
legal blah-blah-blah,

40:14.060 --> 40:15.990
- you are now united in matrimony.
- Can we... ?

40:16.047 --> 40:19.889
- Hurry up and kiss.
- That's the point I wanted anyway.

40:24.534 --> 40:26.797
- No.
- Ooh!

40:29.552 --> 40:31.604
What's happening?

40:31.724 --> 40:33.636
Where are you going?

40:43.626 --> 40:46.144
- Okay, should we? Yeah.
- Yeah.
