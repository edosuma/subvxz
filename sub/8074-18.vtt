[melancholy music]

00:09.443 --> 00:14.115
Stacy, uh, can't wear that.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.384
Have to think of the customers.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.985
Yeah, she's right, Stacy.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.253
I mean, these are truckers.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.088
What's with the bra?

00:22.890 --> 00:23.857
This isn't for work.

00:23.891 --> 00:24.925
I have a blind date.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.294
Oh, blind date.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.362
Oh, and that's
such a nice dress.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.630
I can see you're an outie!

00:33.301 --> 00:35.769
Could she be any more annoying?

00:35.803 --> 00:40.241
Well, she could dye her hair
black and gain 200 pounds.

00:40.274 --> 00:44.712
Do you find her
at all attractive?

00:44.745 --> 00:47.148
Nope.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.616
Man, am I gay.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.423
PETE: Excuse me.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.957
I'm looking for Stacy.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.791
I'm Stacey.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.631
Are you the only
Stacy who works here?

01:03.664 --> 01:04.932
Yeah.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.568
The one who's got a blind
date with a guy named Pete?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.403
Yeah, that's me.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.272
Hey, do you guys sell
lottery tickets here?

01:14.074 --> 01:16.477
Look, Pete, I still have to
work for another half an hour.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.279
Would it be OK if I just
met you at the club?

01:18.312 --> 01:21.782
Oh, sure, sure.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.518
This is the Lunch
Box on Main, right?

01:24.552 --> 01:25.353
I'll see you there.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.496
Excuse me, ma'am,
can I help you?

01:35.529 --> 01:36.830
Oh, and I'm sorry!

01:36.864 --> 01:37.898
You work here!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.133
Oh, I'm sorry!

01:39.167 --> 01:41.001
Just getting so confused
you because I just see

01:41.034 --> 01:44.305
you sitting around everywhere.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.240
I can't go out with that guy!

01:46.274 --> 01:47.308
He's wearing a tie.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.477
Well, Stacy, be optimistic.

01:49.510 --> 01:53.381
Maybe he's on trial
for something.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.149
Jackie, will you
come dancing with me?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.351
I'd feel much better if I
had a girlfriend with me.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.954
Well then, perhaps you
should find one, Ms. Flagler.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.257
I am running a business here.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.058
And the boss-employee
relationship

02:05.092 --> 02:08.329
is the linchpin of that
aforementioned enterprise.

02:08.362 --> 02:11.265
Does Lee Iaccoca go gallivanting
around with his mechanics?

02:11.299 --> 02:12.733
I don't think so!

02:17.538 --> 02:19.072
Jackie, have
you seen Roseanne?

02:19.106 --> 02:20.007
Yes.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.909
She is at Auntie
Barbara's, mother.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.177
Why didn't she tell me?

02:23.211 --> 02:24.345
I'd have gone with her.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.815
Well, I guess she
never thought of that.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.950
Is this your mother?

02:29.983 --> 02:30.851
Hi!

02:30.884 --> 02:33.086
I'm Stacy, the new bus person.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.922
Hi.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.425
Well, aren't you a pretty thing.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.628
And it's so nice you're not
afraid to show everybody.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.201
Mother, I will tell my
employees how they can dress.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.969
I should've known
you'd approve this.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.739
It looks like something you
might have worn in your wilder

02:51.772 --> 02:55.343
days, if you had a bosom.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.011
Mother, I don't need
you harassing the help.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.713
I would never dream
of being critical!

02:59.747 --> 03:03.284
I mean, I hardly know the girl.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.786
Perhaps she'll get
pregnant on a first date

03:05.819 --> 03:08.021
and settle down like you did.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.124
It's sex, Mother.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.527
I know why you're
saying these things.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.995
Excuse me?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.830
I used to think that
people that insulted me were

03:16.864 --> 03:18.165
just mean, stupid, or horrible.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.533
But now I think it's
just because they've

03:19.567 --> 03:22.770
never had really good sex.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.805
What are you talking about?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.007
Well, here's a
really good test.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.141
Have you ever done it.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.577
And when you were
through, your hands

03:29.610 --> 03:31.245
were just filled with his hair?

03:31.279 --> 03:32.446
But you don't remember
pulling it out?

03:35.182 --> 03:37.351
Well, I'm leaving.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.521
I'm going to have a
respectable conversation

03:40.554 --> 03:44.325
with a couple of longshoreman.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.559

03:45.593 --> 03:47.094
I'm sorry.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.462
I was just trying to help.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.363
Are you mad at me?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.498
No, no.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.799
Come on.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.102

04:55.763 --> 04:57.097
Huh?

04:57.130 --> 05:02.302

in a cold bottle beside you.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.136

05:06.039 --> 05:07.775
You know, a good thing
about these blowouts

05:07.808 --> 05:10.210
is they show more
to cheerleaders.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.879
Of course, there's
no milk in those,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.814

look at just the same.

can go through with this.

Look, you don't have a lot
of friends, so don't cross me.

Hey, Dad, is it all right if
George sleeps over tonight?

05:40.207 --> 05:41.475
No, you got school tomorrow.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.443
No, we don't.

It's George

yesterday off for-- whatever

05:46.246 --> 05:48.081
they call it, President's Day?

05:48.115 --> 05:50.718
Yeah, but that was to
celebrate all presidents.

Uh, yeah.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.725
Right.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.894

tomorrow off too.

that was a pretty good one.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.254
We Really had you going there.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.924
Yeah, you sure
did have me going.

And I'll tell you
what, no punishment.

No, but I had you
going, didn't I?

07:09.530 --> 07:10.964
Hey, Dan?

07:10.998 --> 07:14.267
Can I get your
opinion on something?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.003
You think it's all
right for one spouse

07:16.036 --> 07:19.973
to go out for a night of fun
without the other spouse?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.241
Yes.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.110
Jackie, if Fred wants to
play poker on Thursday night,

07:23.143 --> 07:24.077
you should let him.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.278
It's Jackie that
wants to go out.

07:25.312 --> 07:29.082
I wasn't listening.
What were we talking about?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.552
She wants to go out again with
Stacy like she did last night.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.654
And I just don't think
doing separate stuff can

07:33.687 --> 07:35.155
be healthy for the marriage.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.957
Dan and Roseanne do
separate stuff all the time!

07:36.990 --> 07:38.926
That doesn't mean
that he likes it.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.729
You hate it when Roseanne's
away from you, don't you, Dan?

07:41.762 --> 07:42.563
Yes.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.467
Good effort, Dan.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.036
Aw, Fred, look.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.239
Couples spending time apart
is critical for a marriage.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.475
If Roseanne didn't go
on these periodic trips,

07:55.509 --> 07:59.412
I'd only have death
to look forward to.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.214
Fine, go dancing with Stacy.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.183

with the clucking, the girl

08:38.051 --> 08:38.919
talk.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.053
I'll see you later, Dan.

Hey.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.224
We's a going to trash men,
I got a complaint for you.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.993
I'm always complimenting
that Fred at work,

08:46.026 --> 08:47.194
but does he ever give me a hug?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.071
Oh.

- She's at home?

Jackie, how about
a game of pool?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.149
No, I don't want to--

09:09.182 --> 09:11.284
Pete, stay here
and guard the stools.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.119

OK, girl talk.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.161

Yeah, it looks like you're
out in a bar with a man.

Well, you're just
reading that into it, Dan.

09:29.036 --> 09:33.006

happens to be male.

establishment that

09:35.008 --> 09:36.744
happens to serve beverages.

for being in a building

09:41.615 --> 09:44.151
Oh, you are definitely
in a bar with a man.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.119
We are friends who
like to go out dancing.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.187
Nothing is going to happen.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.121
Nothing happened last night.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.422
It's not going to
happen tonight.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.658
Last night?

09:50.691 --> 09:54.294
Ayyy, you hadn't put
that together yet, had you?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.495
You've got to
tell Fred about this

09:55.528 --> 09:57.164
or he'll pick it
up on the streets.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.465
How's that going to happen?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.300
I will stand in the street
and yell it at your house.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.134
Dan--

10:04.037 --> 10:05.405
You're not going to do that.

And why upset Fred over nothing?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.343
You swear to me that
there's nothing going

10:10.377 --> 10:11.344
on between you and this guy?

10:11.378 --> 10:12.512
Cross my legs and hope to die.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.317
All right, I believe you.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.251
Hey.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.152
Can I have the winner?

10:19.186 --> 10:20.187
Sure, Pete.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.822
Unless I win.
Can't have me!

10:21.855 --> 10:22.823
[all chuckling awkwardly]

10:22.856 --> 10:26.727
[music]

10:26.760 --> 10:35.035
[music]

10:35.068 --> 10:36.536
Hi, Dan.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.906
Killing yourself?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.340
Hey, Fred.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.876
Didn't expect to see you here.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.245
20 years of burned
fat and gristle.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.047
Turns out it's a lot bigger
inside than what we thought.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.518
I just came by to
apologize for the other day.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.053
Oh, you don't have to do that.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.055
No, you were right
about Jackie going out.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.556
I have never seen her happier.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.692
Fred I really,
really don't want

10:58.726 --> 11:01.028
to take any credit for that.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.730
Hey, this is cool.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.832
You got all your screws
and your washers separated

11:04.865 --> 11:05.999
into these little baby jars.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.367
Maybe I should do this, huh?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.401
Well, Fred, that's up to you.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.738
I'm not giving out
any more advice.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.272
- I was just asking.
- No, Fred.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.506
No more.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.175
I'm not handing out any more
free advice willy-nilly.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.779
You figure out the baby
jar thing for yourself.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.680
OK, Dan.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.182
See you later.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.484
Oh listen, I might be late
for your poker game tonight.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.353
I've got to find a
sitter because Jackie

11:26.386 --> 11:28.588
is having another night out.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.358
OK, see you.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.026
You know, I don't
get why the weather

11:33.060 --> 11:37.264
man always puts up a sun
with a big smiley face on it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.032
I mean, just because
it's sunny doesn't

11:39.066 --> 11:39.967
mean you're going to be happy.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.338
That is the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.742
Hey, you're the one that's
always so philosophical.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.077
Why didn't you tell
me she wasn't there?

11:55.248 --> 11:56.349
What's wrong, man?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.086
You're pacing back and
forth like a caged--

11:59.119 --> 12:00.921
guy.

12:00.954 --> 12:01.822
Nothing.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.623
It's just stuff.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.657
Can we help?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.759
No.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.161
You must be this big
to ride this problem.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.329
Come on, Mr. Conner.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.331
You help us out with
problems all the time.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.534
Can't we help you once?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.370
OK.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.607
There's this friend of mine.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.109
And all signs seem
to point to the fact

12:22.142 --> 12:24.244
that his wife is maybe--

12:24.277 --> 12:26.179
sort of cheating on him.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.080
Wow.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.281
Yeah.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.117
See, she claims she was
out with this other woman.

12:30.150 --> 12:34.687
But it seems as though she
was actually with a man.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.825
And the husband's sitting
home all by himself.

12:37.858 --> 12:41.661
I'm sorry, man.
Mrs. Conner sucks.

12:41.694 --> 12:42.562
Mark, no.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.663
It's not Mrs. Conner.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.032
Come on, Dan.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.300
Away with another woman, husband
home alone, I'm not stupid.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.768
Who's the guy?
Let's get him!

12:48.802 --> 12:49.970
DAN: Mark!
- Hey!

12:50.003 --> 12:50.904
Mark!

12:50.938 --> 12:53.373
We're not going to
beat anybody up.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.274
I gotcha.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.642
You're glad to be rid of her.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.477
Ah, me too.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.814
She's a mean old bat and you
can do way better than her.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.182
Again, Mark, it's
not Mrs. Conner.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.984
But I'll be sure to let her
know how you feel about her.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.457
Mr. Conner, do you
want to talk any more

13:10.490 --> 13:11.424
about your friend's problem?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.325
No thanks.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.226
It's OK.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.127
Mark won't come in.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.396
He just heard a fire truck.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.730
Come on.

13:17.764 --> 13:18.832
All right.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.768
It's just-- I don't
know what to do here.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.171
I mean, the wife doesn't have
the decency to try to hide it.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.206
It's almost like
she's flaunting it.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.141
Well, if she's not
trying to hide it,

13:28.175 --> 13:31.011
my guess is she
wants to get caught.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.645
What are you talking about?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.614
Maybe she wants attention.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.184
It's like when DJ does something
wrong directly in front of you.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.053
When you yell at him, he
knows you care about him.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.956
Oh, no that's just
what Mrs. Conner said.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.259
More often than not, we
don't care about the boy.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.496
All I'm saying is, is that
maybe if your friend paid

13:49.529 --> 13:51.098
a little more
attention to his wife

13:51.131 --> 13:53.133
then she might just
stop doing this stuff

13:53.166 --> 13:56.036
and the problems would go away.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.704
Maybe.

13:57.737 --> 13:58.605
Thanks, David.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.873
You're all right.

13:59.907 --> 14:00.707
Thanks.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.048
Oh, God, Mr. Conner,
don't break up!

14:08.081 --> 14:10.250
You guys are like
my mom and dad!

14:10.283 --> 14:14.955
[music]

14:14.988 --> 14:15.956
[knocking]

14:15.989 --> 14:16.856
Hey, buddy.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.125
Glad you could make it.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.993
Where is everybody?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.794
Poker's still on, isn't it?
- Yeah.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.263
I told everybody to
show up a little late.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.298
I kind of need to talk to you.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.234
Sounds serious.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.970
OK.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.739
There's no easy way
to say this, so uh--

14:32.772 --> 14:33.573
here.

14:36.643 --> 14:37.610
What's this?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.279
It's the letter I wrote you.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.849
Uh, I figure you can read
it while I'm in the kitchen,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.484
get through your
emotional stuff.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.153
And then if you want to,
come on in and play poker.

14:48.788 --> 14:49.756
Whoa!

14:49.789 --> 14:51.491
You caught Jackie
with another man!

14:51.524 --> 14:52.592
What is this?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.227
It's in the letter.
I'll be in the kitchen.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.163
Wait a second, Dan!

14:56.196 --> 14:57.064
Well she kissing him?

14:57.097 --> 14:58.131
Was he touching her?

14:58.165 --> 15:00.433
Dan, you've got to
tell me what you saw.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.302
OK, I'll try to
make this quick.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.403
Hey, guys!

15:03.436 --> 15:04.938
Too late.

15:04.972 --> 15:07.340
Dan, I've got to hear this.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.242
Bob, you weren't supposed
to show up for another half

15:09.276 --> 15:10.143
an hour, buddy.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.178
Not my fault, Dan.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.147
I was getting on
my wife's nerves.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.182
Well, uh, look.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.383
Could you put his
beer in the fridge?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.684
And just give us a sec.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.386
You've got it.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.220
Fred.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.457
OK.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.858
Start at the beginning.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.894
Where did you catch her?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.029
It was at the Lobo.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.165
And I really don't think
anything's happened yet.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.100
But you don't know that.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.534
Hey, anybody want a brewski?

15:34.567 --> 15:35.902
No, thanks.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.004
What, you don't want a beer?

15:37.037 --> 15:37.904
Somebody call the paper!

15:37.937 --> 15:40.974
Dan doesn't want a beer!

15:41.008 --> 15:41.874
OK, Bob.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.376
I'll take a beer.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.112
You got it.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.546
Look, I talked
to her about this

15:46.579 --> 15:49.149
and she swears
they're just friends.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.118
Then what the hell is
she doing with him?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.019
Dan-o!

15:52.052 --> 15:54.054
Where's your bottle opener?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.022
They're twist-offs, Bob.

15:55.055 --> 15:55.989
Yeah, I know.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.557
But I got this
real delicate skin.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.558
And I'm not just saying that.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.560
My doctor told me.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.095
Look, Bob.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.596
Nobody wants a beer.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.198
We don't want to
hear about your skin.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.833
We just need two minutes alone.

16:06.866 --> 16:09.636
Can you do that, please?

16:09.669 --> 16:10.803
Yeah, sure, Dan.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.072
Just making conversation.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.210
Look, Fred.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.479
I'm pretty sure it was
just a cry for attention.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.814
It was almost like she
wanted to be caught.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.915
You think that's all it is?

16:22.949 --> 16:23.850
I'm pretty sure.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.019
So just spend more
time with her.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.255
Show her a good time.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.423
Act like you're dating again.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.658
- No.
- What?

16:31.691 --> 16:32.725
Why not?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.927
Because I married an adult, Dan.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.230
If she's got a problem,
she should tell me.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.366
I'm not going to play these
stupid high school games.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.834
Marriage is not a game, Fred!

16:41.868 --> 16:43.470
A game is something that's
fun and you can win.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.637
Marriage is a blood sport.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.711
Oh, I don't know.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.114
Maybe you're right.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.349
Maybe I'll just have
to do something.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.085
Good.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.252
I really think it will help.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.153
Thanks, Dan.

17:00.187 --> 17:00.987
You're a good friend.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.794
[door opening]

17:07.827 --> 17:10.263
[door closing]

17:10.297 --> 17:12.399
BOB: Dan?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.901
What?

17:14.934 --> 17:17.204
BOB: I'm lonely.

17:17.237 --> 17:23.476
[music]

17:23.510 --> 17:25.612
God, you're good!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.614
You know, you don't
dance like a guy.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.981
I mean, obviously,
you are a guy.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.383
So you do dance like a guy.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.019
But I mean, you dance like a guy
who's like a really good dancer

17:33.052 --> 17:35.388
who just happens to be a guy!

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
Well, thanks, I guess.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.191
Where'd you learn
to dance like that?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.326
Oh, you know, nowhere.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.460
I just picked it up.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.594
Oh, come on.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.263
You don't pick up steps
like that from anywhere.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.931
No, It's nothing.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.800
It's just that I, uh--

17:47.834 --> 17:48.835
I used to take ballet.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.737
Used to what?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.071
I took ballet.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.206
Oh.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.609
Well, lots of kids' moms
make them take ballet.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.147
Mom was against it.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.484
Well, little kids
like to experiment.

18:04.517 --> 18:08.121
- I was 17.
- Those rebel teens.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.225
I still go Tuesday nights.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.293
OK.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.227
Well--

18:14.261 --> 18:17.930
[chuckling]
I have hemorrhoids.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.568
[laughing nervously]

18:21.601 --> 18:22.669
You do?

18:22.702 --> 18:23.903
No, I'm just trying
to think of something

18:23.936 --> 18:26.273
to make you feel better.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.174
You want a beer?

18:27.207 --> 18:28.941
- Yeah.
- What kind, honey?

18:28.975 --> 18:29.809
Uh, just a light.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.915
What'd you just call me?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.850
Oh, I think I said honey.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.986
I guess I was being
presumptuous, huh?

18:40.019 --> 18:41.020
No.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.089
No, it felt good.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.023
Good.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.493
Yeah.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.695
What the hell am I doing here?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.696
Jackie?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.198
You called me
honey and I liked it.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.098
It felt good.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.300
I mean, it felt more than good.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.801
It felt right.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.270
Well, good and right.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.072
Those are good right, right?

19:00.106 --> 19:01.574
I am a married woman!

19:01.608 --> 19:02.675
I have a child!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.844
She's, uh, not
used to the beer.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.679
I am cheating on my husband!

19:06.713 --> 19:07.580
Jackie!

19:07.614 --> 19:09.115
We've never even held hands!

19:09.148 --> 19:12.185
Don't touch me!

19:12.219 --> 19:15.054
You and your lively,
fun self, luring me in!

19:15.087 --> 19:16.689
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.057
We should both be ashamed.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.326
I really have
enjoyed your company.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.395
I'm sorry it couldn't work out.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.830
You, all of you!

19:23.863 --> 19:24.764
All of you!

19:24.797 --> 19:26.599
Go home to your husbands!

19:26.633 --> 19:34.841
[music]

19:34.874 --> 19:36.343
Fred, I'm really
glad you're here.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.810
We need to talk.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.711
Do that.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.013
You want to talk?

19:41.047 --> 19:43.983
Fine.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.352
Here's my phone number.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.286
What is this?

19:46.319 --> 19:47.186
I'm leaving.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.255
What?

19:48.288 --> 19:49.789
Did you go out with
another man tonight?

19:49.822 --> 19:50.690
I know.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.124
But I can explain.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.593
That's explanation
enough for me.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.527
Fred, wait.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.329
Wait!
Now, wait.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.730
Nothing happened!

19:57.764 --> 19:58.765
You broke the rules, Jackie.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.666
What rules?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.833
The rules of marriage.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.535
We both agreed to them.
You broke them.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.503
And now I'm leaving.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.737
We have to talk about it!

20:04.771 --> 20:05.572
No!

20:09.208 --> 20:16.115
[melancholy music]

20:16.148 --> 20:19.652
You may have noticed that I
was not on tonight's episode.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.255
That's because I'm
pregnant, and the doctors

20:22.289 --> 20:24.524
ordered me to stay in bed.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.759
But you needn't worry about me.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.660
I will be paid.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.066
Now we have many
younger viewers.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.304
And they're probably wondering
where babies come from.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.138
Since I've always
felt that TV should

20:39.171 --> 20:44.176
not only entertain, but also
educate, I'd like to tell you.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.646
When a woman decides that
she's ready to have a baby,

20:46.679 --> 20:49.148
she finds herself a man.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.051
It could be a limo
driver or a bodyguard.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.621
It really doesn't matter,
as long as he's younger

20:54.654 --> 20:57.690
and not in show business.

20:57.724 --> 21:01.160
Now the man and the woman go
off together alone to a place

21:01.193 --> 21:03.062
where they can conceive a child.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.398
This place is called a clinic.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.638
The man is sent to one room
and the woman to another.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.073
The woman's egg
and the man's sperm

21:14.106 --> 21:18.978
are put together and manipulated
by a laser and 15 doctors.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.247
Then they are placed
back in the womb

21:21.280 --> 21:24.384
and monitored by ultrasound
and hormone therapy

21:24.417 --> 21:28.388
until the many experts are sure
that conception has occurred.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.790
Now, I know it may be hard
for many of you children

21:30.823 --> 21:33.426
to picture your own
parents doing this.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.396
But someday, you
will understand.

21:36.429 --> 21:41.067
It is the most beautiful
and intimate experience

21:41.100 --> 21:44.270
that can be shared
by a woman, a man,

21:44.303 --> 21:47.039
and their fertility expert.

21:47.073 --> 21:56.916
