WEBVTT

00:02.033 --> 00:03.333
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:03.333 --> 00:06.267
HELP MY MOM
WITH THE BAGS, HUH?

00:06.267 --> 00:07.767
- [sighs]
HELLO, RAYMOND.

00:07.767 --> 00:11.633
- OH, HEY, HEY, LET ME GET THAT
FOR YOU THERE, MOM.

00:11.633 --> 00:12.800
- OH, RAYMOND.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.133
I HAVE TO SAY,

00:14.133 --> 00:17.000
I JUST LOVE
HEARING YOU CALLING ME THAT.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.200
- [laughs quietly]

00:18.200 --> 00:21.733
- YES, RAY, I HEARD.
VERY SWEET.

00:21.733 --> 00:25.833
I'M JUST GONNA GO
CHECK ON THE KIDS.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.133
- LOOK, RAY.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.300
I BOUGHT THE DOUGHNUT HOLES
YOU LIKE.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.767
DON'T SHOW DEBRA.

00:30.767 --> 00:33.067
- AH, CHOCOLATE.
- MM.

00:33.067 --> 00:37.333
- THANKS, MOM.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.267
- HELLO, MARIE.
- HI! HEY!

00:40.267 --> 00:42.100
HI!
WHOA!

00:42.100 --> 00:43.500
DIDN'T HEAR YOU.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.233
GONNA TIE A BELL
AROUND YOUR NECK.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.800
- HELLO, LOIS.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.567
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT ANYTHING.

00:55.567 --> 00:56.867
- NO, NO, NO.

00:56.867 --> 00:58.933
RAYMOND'S JUST HELPING ME
WITH THE GROCERIES.

00:58.933 --> 01:02.000
HE IS SUCH A NICE BOY.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.067
- YES, INDEED.

01:04.067 --> 01:06.500
YOU KNOW, LOIS, YOU'RE HERE
FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.300
LET ME UNPACK THOSE GROCERIES.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.333
YOU GO ENJOY YOUR GRANDCHILDREN.

01:10.333 --> 01:12.033
- ARE YOU SURE, MARIE?
- OF COURSE.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.433
RAYMOND WILL STAY
AND HELP ME.

01:13.433 --> 01:16.600
- OH, OKAY.
GREAT.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.433
THANK YOU.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.867
- SO YOU AND LOIS
ARE GETTING ALONG?

01:31.867 --> 01:36.333
- WELL, YES.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT, I GUESS.

01:36.333 --> 01:40.000
- YOU TWO SEEM
TO BE VERY FAMILIAR.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.600
- OH, YOU MEAN THE "MOM" THING?

01:41.600 --> 01:43.067
YEAH, REMEMBER,
I CALLED HER THAT

01:43.067 --> 01:45.033
AT THANKSGIVING THE ONE TIME?

01:45.033 --> 01:46.033
I DON'T KNOW.

01:46.033 --> 01:47.433
I GUESS SHE LIKES IT, SO...

01:47.433 --> 01:51.033
[chuckles]
THROW HER A BONE.

01:51.033 --> 01:54.400
- I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL
THAT YOU'RE STILL DOING IT.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.200
- YEAH?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.767
- OF COURSE.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.667
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.600
YOU HAVE TWO MOMS NOW:

02:00.600 --> 02:04.500
THIS NEW ONE
AND THE ONE GOD GAVE YOU.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.033
- GOT TO GET THAT BELL.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.533
- WELL, THE CHILDREN ARE DOWN,

02:24.533 --> 02:27.333
AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA DO IT
FOR ME FOR TONIGHT TOO.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.200
- OH, THANKS, MOM.
GOOD NIGHT.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.800
- GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.133
GOOD NIGHT, RAYMOND.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.600
- GOOD NIGHT TO YOU.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.333
[singing]
AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU

02:43.333 --> 02:46.433
"SOUND OF MUSIC."
I LOVE THAT MOVIE.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.033
- WHAT WAS THAT?

02:57.033 --> 02:58.367
- HMM, WHAT?

02:58.367 --> 03:00.633
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL HER "MOM"?

03:00.633 --> 03:06.467
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DOES ANYBODY DO ANYTHING?

03:06.467 --> 03:08.267
- I MEAN,
YOU WERE DOING IT,

03:08.267 --> 03:10.400
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT
DOING IT ANYMORE?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.500
- WELL, I WAS WONDERING,
DO I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY SAY IT?

03:12.500 --> 03:14.533
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CALL YOU
THE SAME THING EVERY TIME,

03:14.533 --> 03:16.600
MY HOT LITTLE CHUCKLE MONKEY.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.733
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
SHE LIKES "MOM."

03:22.733 --> 03:24.733
- LOOK, I'M JUST--
I'M MIXING IT UP.

03:24.733 --> 03:28.400
I'M PICKING MY SPOTS.
I'M KEEPING IT FRESH.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.033
- I KNOW, HONEY, BUT I LIKED IT

03:30.033 --> 03:31.300
THAT YOU TWO WERE
GETTING CLOSER.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.833
YOU KNOW, IT WAS NICE.

03:32.833 --> 03:35.167
IT FELT LIKE A FAMILY.

03:35.167 --> 03:38.700
- THEM'S THE BREAKS.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.933
- RAY, COME ON.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.667
- WHAT?
LOOK, IT'S JUST--

03:42.667 --> 03:45.600
IT MAKES THINGS
KIND OF CONFUSING AROUND HERE.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.733
- CONFUSING?

03:46.733 --> 03:48.533
YOU CALL HER "MOM."
SHE CALLS YOU "RAYMOND."

03:48.533 --> 03:50.067
- RIGHT, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

03:50.067 --> 03:52.167
THIS PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH MOMS, RIGHT?

03:52.167 --> 03:53.167
YOU'RE A MOM.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.467
SHE'S A MOM.

03:54.467 --> 03:58.533
THERE'S THAT ONE OVER THERE.

03:58.533 --> 03:59.800
- WAIT A MINUTE.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.667
DID YOUR MOM TELL YOU
NOT TO CALL MY MOM "MOM"?

04:03.667 --> 04:05.400
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.

04:05.400 --> 04:09.100
BUT SHE CAUGHT ME
SAYING IT TODAY, AND

04:09.100 --> 04:13.233
AN ICY WIND
THROUGH THIS ROOM DID BLOW.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE CAUGHT YOU?

04:21.367 --> 04:23.233
HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING IT
FROM HER?

04:23.233 --> 04:24.700
- NO, I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SURE

04:24.700 --> 04:28.033
EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY
IS EMOTIONALLY

04:28.033 --> 04:30.667
GROOVY.

04:30.667 --> 04:33.967
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA CAVE IN
TO YOUR MOTHER AGAIN.

04:33.967 --> 04:35.100
- PLEASE?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.767
- [sighs]
OKAY, RAY, FINE.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.800
BUT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
REALLY NICE FOR MY MOM

04:38.800 --> 04:40.167
AND FOR YOU TOO.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.500
THINGS BETWEEN YOU TWO
SEEMED TO BE SO HEALTHY.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.733
YOUR RELATIONSHIP'S, LIKE,
REALLY STARTING TO BLOSSOM.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.233
BUT YOU WANT TO RUIN
A GOOD THING?

04:47.233 --> 04:49.133
FINE.
IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.467
- OH, COME ON.

04:51.467 --> 04:54.133
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CALL MY MOM "MOM."

04:54.133 --> 04:57.833
- [scoffs]
YEAH.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.067
- NO, WAIT, WAIT.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.333
WHAT ARE YOU SCOFFING
AT THAT FOR?

05:00.333 --> 05:02.167
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL MY MOM "MOM"?

05:02.167 --> 05:03.933
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

05:03.933 --> 05:06.000
- OH, YEAH.
SEE, HUH?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.767
YEAH, IT'S EASY
TO USE THE GLUE

05:07.767 --> 05:11.400
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KILL THE HORSE YOURSELF.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.500
- WHAT?

05:17.500 --> 05:18.900
- NO.
NO, I'M STAYING WITH THAT.

05:18.900 --> 05:22.333
THAT MAKES SENSE.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.000
- YEAH, RAY, I THINK THINGS
BETWEEN YOUR MOM AND ME

05:25.000 --> 05:26.367
ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.833
- OH, YEAH, REALLY?
HOW SO?

05:27.833 --> 05:30.233
- LOOK, I SEE HER EVERY DAY.

05:30.233 --> 05:31.533
WE'RE TOGETHER ALL THE TIME.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.033
- THAT'S RIGHT.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.533
THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON
WHY YOU SHOULD CALL HER "MOM."

05:35.533 --> 05:39.867
THINGS COULD BE MUCH MORE
HEALTHIER BETWEEN YOU TWO.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.533
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:42.533 --> 05:46.567
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
COULD REALLY START TO BLOSSOM.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.067
AH, NOTHING TO SAY TODAY?

05:59.433 --> 06:01.267
FOR YOU.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.067
- HEY, GUYS.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.700
- HEY, DEB.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.867
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:12.867 --> 06:14.067
- NOTHING.
EATING ZEPPOLES.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.267
- OH!

06:16.267 --> 06:17.467
IS, UH--IS MARIE AROUND?

06:17.467 --> 06:19.633
I WANTED TO BORROW
HER BIG SPOON.

06:19.633 --> 06:21.333
- OH, IS THAT IT?

06:21.333 --> 06:24.367
- OH, YEAH.
THANKS.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.567
- YOU OKAY?

06:29.567 --> 06:31.000
- UH, YEAH.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.633
YEAH, I THOUGHT I'D--
MAYBE I'D ALSO SAY HI TO MARIE.

06:37.667 --> 06:41.033
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

06:41.033 --> 06:43.867
- NO REASON.
JUST CHECKING IN.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.933
- LET ME GET HER FOR YOU.

06:45.933 --> 06:48.467
MARIE!

06:52.067 --> 06:56.500
- SHE WILL BE
WITH YOU PRESENTLY.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.433
MAYBE I'LL COME BACK LATER.
THANKS.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.300
- WHAT IS IT, FRANK?
YOU NEED TO BE BURPED?

07:04.300 --> 07:06.133
- HERE YOU GO, DEB.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.767
- THANK YOU, FRANK.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.233
- WHAT IS IT, DEBRA?

07:09.233 --> 07:11.067
- OH, NOTHING.

07:11.067 --> 07:15.600
SO HOW ARE YOU,
MA-RIE?

07:18.533 --> 07:21.033
- I'M FINE, DEAR, THANK YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

07:21.033 --> 07:22.533
- OH, GOOD.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.733
JUST, UH, THOUGHT
I'D SAY HELLO AND CHECK IN.

07:25.733 --> 07:26.833
- OH, HOW NICE.

07:26.833 --> 07:32.433
- YEAH.
SO HELLO.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.167
- WELL, HELLO TO YOU TOO.

07:35.167 --> 07:39.233
- SCINTILLATING.

07:39.233 --> 07:41.900
- OH, OH, AND I WAS ALSO
GONNA BORROW YOUR BIG SPOON

07:41.900 --> 07:42.900
IF THAT'S OKAY.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.533
I WANTED TO MAKE GOULASH.

07:44.533 --> 07:47.833
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA
TRY THAT AGAIN?

07:47.833 --> 07:48.867
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, HONEY.

07:48.867 --> 07:52.167
GET RIGHT BACK ON THAT HORSE.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.733
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

07:53.733 --> 07:56.633
THANKS.

07:56.633 --> 07:57.500
SO LISTEN--

07:57.500 --> 07:58.800
- OOH, OOH.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.933
I PICKED UP A BOOK FOR YOU.

08:01.933 --> 08:07.000
- "'A' IS FOR APRON:
A BEGINNER'S COOKBOOK."

08:07.000 --> 08:08.833
- I SAW THAT
IN THE BOOKSTORE,

08:08.833 --> 08:10.733
AND I THOUGHT OF YOU.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.500
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

08:12.500 --> 08:16.467
- YEAH, THAT'S JUST, UH,
SO TYPICALLY THOUGHTFUL.

08:16.467 --> 08:17.967
[chuckles]

08:17.967 --> 08:19.767
I'M GONNA GO AWAY NOW.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.167
- HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.567
- UH, JUST A LITTLE HEADACHE.

08:22.567 --> 08:23.367
COMES AND GOES.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.200
AND REALLY COMING ON NOW.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.367
- WAIT, WAIT.
SIT DOWN.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.167
LET ME GET YOU SOME ASPIRIN.

08:29.167 --> 08:33.033
I HAVE THREE
DIFFERENT KINDS.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.300
- SOMETIMES I GET
THOSE HEADACHES

08:34.300 --> 08:37.067
WHEN I COME OVER TOO, DEB.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.500
WHICH KIND IS IT,

08:38.500 --> 08:43.600
DULL, POUNDING,
OR AX TO THE BACK OF THE SKULL?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.300
- HERE YOU GO, DEAR.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.000
OKAY, HERE.
HERE, HERE.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.067
OH, I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.700
- THANKS...

08:54.700 --> 08:55.833
[voice cracks]
MOM.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.667
[fork clangs]

09:07.300 --> 09:10.633
- SO SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:10.633 --> 09:11.867
- I SAID...

09:11.867 --> 09:14.467
[clears throat]
"THANKS, MOM."

09:14.467 --> 09:16.433
- OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT, DEAR.

09:16.433 --> 09:20.367
- NO, I--
I WANT TO.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.700
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.067
- MY NAME'S NOT JUDY!

09:47.467 --> 09:49.167
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:49.167 --> 09:52.400
- SHE REJECTED ME.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.900
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:53.900 --> 09:55.600
- YOUR MOTHER.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.633
I WENT OVER THERE,
AND I CALLED HER "MOM,"

09:58.633 --> 10:02.167
AND SHE TURNED ME DOWN.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.600
- REALLY?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.833
- I TOLD HER THAT
I WANTED TO CALL HER "MOM,"

10:05.833 --> 10:09.600
AND SHE JUST WENT,
"THAT'S ALL RIGHT."

10:09.600 --> 10:12.333
- HUH.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.633
- WHY DID YOU MAKE ME
DO THAT?

10:13.633 --> 10:14.800
- GET OUT OF HERE!

10:14.800 --> 10:17.533
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T MAKE YOU DO IT!

10:17.533 --> 10:19.167
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO WIN AN ARGUMENT.

10:19.167 --> 10:22.767
I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU
WOULD ACTUALLY TRY IT.

10:22.767 --> 10:24.567
- I CANNOT BELIEVE HER!
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE!

10:24.567 --> 10:26.800
YOUR MOTHER
IS UNBELIEVABLE!

10:26.800 --> 10:28.733
- I BELIEVE YOU!

10:28.733 --> 10:30.000
- HEY, DEB.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.533
- OH, GOOD.
YOU GUYS WERE THERE.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.167
WAS THAT THE MOST
HUMILIATING THING

10:33.167 --> 10:34.867
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN?

10:34.867 --> 10:37.133
- BRUTAL, RAYMOND.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.667
- I FELT BAD FOR YOU,
SWEETHEART.

10:40.667 --> 10:44.967
HAD TROUBLE
FINISHING MY LUNCH.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.267
- WHAT HAPPENED?

10:46.267 --> 10:48.133
AFTER SHE SAID NO,
WHAT'D YOU DO?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.200
- JUST SAT THERE
LIKE AN IDIOT.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.600
- US TOO.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.133
- MARIE JUST WENT
ABOUT HER BUSINESS

10:55.133 --> 10:56.400
AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.700
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, DEB.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.133
THAT'S JUST HOW SHE IS.

11:00.133 --> 11:04.567
ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED
IN THE PANTHEON OF AFFECTION:

11:04.567 --> 11:07.200
THE POPE,
FRANK SINATRA,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.000
PLACIDO DOMINGO,

11:09.000 --> 11:12.167
AND RAYMOND.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.700
YOU JUST GOT TO LET IT GO,
THAT'S ALL.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.000
YOU GOT TO LET IT GO!

11:21.100 --> 11:24.767
- YEAH.
LIKE HE DID.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.033
- I KNOW WHAT.

11:26.033 --> 11:28.600
MAYBE I'LL START
CALLING HER "MARIE."

11:28.600 --> 11:30.133
BET SHE WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.667
"HELLO, MARIE."

11:31.667 --> 11:32.567
"HELLO, ROBBIE.

11:32.567 --> 11:36.633
"HAVE YOU SEEN
PLACIDO DOMINGO?

11:36.633 --> 11:39.833
OR RAYMOND?"

11:39.833 --> 11:41.433
- HEY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

11:41.433 --> 11:44.000
IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,
YOU CAN CALL ME "DAD."

11:44.000 --> 11:45.067
- THANKS.

11:45.067 --> 11:48.867
- HOW ABOUT "BIG DADDY"?

11:48.867 --> 11:50.767
I SAW THAT IN A MOVIE ONCE.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.067
- I DON'T GET IT, DEB.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.533
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO CALL HER "MOM" ANYWAY?

11:53.533 --> 11:55.367
- I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.000
I MEAN, RAY IS CALLING
MY MOM "MOM."

11:57.000 --> 12:00.367
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS, MY MOM
IS GOOD AND SWEET AND KIND.

12:00.367 --> 12:03.267
YOUR MOTHER,
ON THE OTHER HAND, IS--

12:03.267 --> 12:08.267
- NEED SOME HELP?

12:08.267 --> 12:09.500
- WELL, LISTEN.
LOOK, YOU TRIED.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.067
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK NOW, RIGHT?

12:11.067 --> 12:12.967
YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO CALL HER "MOM" ANYWAY.

12:12.967 --> 12:16.300
- WELL, THAT'S BEFORE I KNEW
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.533
IT'S JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

12:17.533 --> 12:20.400
I MEAN,
WHY DID SHE DO THAT TO ME?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.133
WHY DOESN'T SHE WANT ME
TO CALL HER "MOM"?

12:22.133 --> 12:23.833
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES
OVER THE YEARS,

12:23.833 --> 12:27.200
BUT I THOUGHT
WE WERE CLOSER THAN THIS.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.467
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T THINK
I'M GOOD ENOUGH.

12:30.467 --> 12:33.367
- I REMEMBER THE YEAR
I TOOK OPERA LESSONS.

12:37.767 --> 12:41.433
- COME ON, DEB, HUH?
DON'T FEEL SAD.

12:41.433 --> 12:45.000
- THANKS FOR TELLING ME
HOW TO FEEL, RAY.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.133
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT A HEADACHE.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.967
I'M GONNA GO LIE DOWN.

12:49.967 --> 12:53.667
- [sighs]

12:53.667 --> 12:55.400
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
SHOULD I GO UP THERE?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.700
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HER?

12:56.700 --> 12:58.367
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:58.367 --> 13:02.067
- THAT YOU SHOULD
NEVER GO UP THERE.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.567
- SHOULD I TALK TO MOM?

13:03.567 --> 13:06.667
- [laughs]

13:06.667 --> 13:09.500
- WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY TO HER?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.200
- LISTEN TO ME.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.400
THIS IS ABOUT FEELINGS.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.100
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FEELINGS?

13:15.100 --> 13:17.000
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.133
NONE OF US DO.

13:19.133 --> 13:23.233
SO JUST SIT DOWN,
SHUT UP,

13:23.233 --> 13:25.600
LOOSEN YOUR PANTS.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.433
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO?

13:28.433 --> 13:30.067
TV announcer:
FASTBALL INSIDE--

13:30.067 --> 13:32.067
- I'VE GOT LEFTOVERS.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.033
HELLO, DEAR.
I'VE GOT THE EXTRA ZEPPOLES.

13:43.033 --> 13:44.500
IF I LEAVE THEM AT OUR HOUSE,

13:44.500 --> 13:46.700
YOU FATHER WILL JUST EAT THEM
TILL HE EXPLODES.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.667
- MM, YEAH.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.367
SO I GUESS
YOU TALKED TO DEBRA.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.767
- OH, YEAH.
HOW'S HER HEADACHE?

13:50.767 --> 13:52.367
- NOT GOOD, MA.
- OH.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.367
- WHY DID YOU TELL HER
SHE CAN'T CALL YOU "MOM," HUH?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.567
SHE'S VERY UPSET.

13:55.567 --> 13:56.700
- SHE IS?

13:56.700 --> 13:57.500
- OF COURSE!

13:57.500 --> 13:58.700
YOU COULDN'T SEE THAT?

13:58.700 --> 14:00.233
EVEN ROBERT AND DAD
COULD TELL THAT.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.067
GUYS, COULDN'T YOU--

14:12.033 --> 14:13.400
- UH, ARE YOU TELLING ME

14:13.400 --> 14:15.833
THAT DEBRA REALLY WANTS
TO CALL ME "MOM"?

14:15.833 --> 14:17.200
- YES.
YES, SHE DOES.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.567
- I THINK SHE'S JUST DOING THAT

14:18.567 --> 14:20.700
BECAUSE SHE WANTS YOU
TO CALL LOIS "MOM."

14:20.700 --> 14:22.633
- NO! NO! NO! NO!

14:22.633 --> 14:28.100
I'VE SAID FOUR "NO"s.
IT DESERVES EVEN MORE.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.133
- WELL, THEN,
WHY, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

14:31.133 --> 14:34.967
AFTER 12 YEARS,
AM I SUDDENLY "MOM"?

14:34.967 --> 14:38.333
- WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE DEBRA'S
THE KIND OF PERSON

14:38.333 --> 14:40.133
THAT TAKES A WHILE
TO WARM UP.

14:40.133 --> 14:41.600
THAT'S ALL, HUH?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.667
YOU KNOW, SHE JUST STARTED
CALLING ME "HONEY,"

14:43.667 --> 14:46.200
LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.400
LOOK, COME--

14:47.400 --> 14:49.067
JUST LET HER
CALL YOU "MOM," HUH?

14:49.067 --> 14:50.467
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

14:50.467 --> 14:52.900
- BECAUSE IT WASN'T
A REAL REQUEST.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.467
IT WASN'T GENUINE.

14:54.467 --> 14:55.800
AND YOU KNOW ME, RAYMOND.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.567
I'M NOTHING
IF I'M NOT GENUINE.

14:59.567 --> 15:00.900
- YEAH, I KNOW.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.900
WE ALL KNOW
WHAT A GENUINE

15:02.900 --> 15:05.700
PERSON YOU ARE.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.500
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
YOU WERE RIGHT, OKAY?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.200
DEBRA DID GO OVER THERE
BECAUSE SHE LIKES

15:10.200 --> 15:11.700
WHEN I CALL HER MOTHER "MOM,"

15:11.700 --> 15:14.600
AND I TOLD HER SHE HAD
TO CALL YOU "MOM" BECAUSE,

15:14.600 --> 15:19.200
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST LIKE TO BOTHER HER.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.633
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SHE DID SOMETHING NICE, MA.

15:22.633 --> 15:25.733
AND WHEN YOU TURNED HER DOWN,
YOU HURT HER FEELINGS.

15:25.733 --> 15:29.567
- HOW COULD I HURT HER FEELINGS
IF THEY'RE NOT REAL?

15:29.567 --> 15:33.733
- LOOK, I'M NOT PRETENDING
TO UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.967
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.100
IF HER FEELINGS GOT HURT,

15:37.100 --> 15:40.200
DOESN'T THAT MEAN
THEY WERE REAL?

15:41.767 --> 15:47.733
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT'S, LIKE,
THE TEST FOR FEELINGS.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.767
REMEMBER THE TIN MAN GUY?

15:49.767 --> 15:53.267
"I KNOW I GOT A HEART,
BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN."

15:57.567 --> 16:02.200
AND THEN EVERYBODY SAID,
"AW, POOR TIN MAN GUY."

16:05.900 --> 16:07.100
- HELLO.
- OH, DEBRA.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.267
- I'M JUST GONNA GO GET A DRINK,

16:08.267 --> 16:09.467
AND THEN I'LL BE
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

16:09.467 --> 16:13.067
- NO, DEBRA, WAIT.
WAIT.

16:13.067 --> 16:15.500
DEBRA, I'M SORRY.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.000
I SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU CALL ME "MOM."

16:18.000 --> 16:21.233
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
YOU SHOULD DO IT,

16:21.233 --> 16:24.767
'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.800
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.067
- NO, NO, IT'S--NO.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.233
NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.700
RAYMOND TOLD ME
YOU ONLY CAME OVER

16:32.700 --> 16:33.800
BECAUSE HE MADE YOU.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.733
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
- RIGHT.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.733
HE SAID HE DID IT
BECAUSE HE LIKES TO BOTHER YOU.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.133
I HAD NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I MEANT TO YOU

16:45.133 --> 16:48.533
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY
BE HURT BY WHAT I SAID.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.667
OH.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.467
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

16:53.467 --> 16:57.500
I WANT YOU TO THINK
OF YOURSELF AS MY DAUGHTER,

16:57.500 --> 17:01.833
BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW I THINK OF YOU.

17:01.833 --> 17:02.867
- OH, MARIE.

17:02.867 --> 17:07.133
- OH, DEBRA.
OH.

17:07.133 --> 17:10.833
SO YOU'LL CALL ME "MOM"?

17:10.833 --> 17:12.067
- I GUESS I WILL.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.700
- OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.467
[chuckles]

17:16.467 --> 17:18.200
DO IT.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.033
- MOM.

17:28.033 --> 17:29.800
- OH, THAT'S SO NICE!
[both laugh]

17:29.800 --> 17:32.433
- IT IS NICE.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.067
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME ICED TEA?

17:34.067 --> 17:36.600
- WOULD I LIKE
SOME ICED TEA...

17:36.600 --> 17:37.467
- MOM?

17:37.467 --> 17:39.833
- OH!
I WOULD LOVE SOME.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.700
[laughs]

17:42.700 --> 17:46.467
- AW.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.767
SEE?
NOW IT'S BLOSSOMING.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.233
- YEAH?

17:50.233 --> 17:51.433
- WAIT A MINUTE.

17:51.433 --> 17:52.800
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR ME, THOUGH?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.833
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO CALL DEBRA'S MOM?

17:54.833 --> 17:56.133
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:56.133 --> 17:58.833
- WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE
THAT OFTEN--

17:58.833 --> 18:01.033
I MEAN, EVERY OTHER CHRISTMAS,
THANKSGIVING,

18:01.033 --> 18:03.233
A BIRTHDAY HERE AND THERE.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.900
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN CALL HER "MOM."

18:04.900 --> 18:06.733
- OH, THANKS, MOM.

18:06.733 --> 18:08.400
- OH.
[laughs]

18:08.400 --> 18:11.033
THAT'S SUCH A PLEASANT CHANGE
FROM THE WAY BOYS SAY IT.

18:11.033 --> 18:12.267
DON'T TELL ROBBIE,

18:12.267 --> 18:14.400
BUT I ALWAYS WANTED HIM
TO BE A GIRL.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.233
- I MIGHT
HAVE TO TELL HIM THAT.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.633
[kids yelling]
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.400
- HI,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.067
MOM.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.867
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.167
- SO HOW WAS THE PARK?

18:37.167 --> 18:39.667
- OH, IT WAS FUN
FOR THE CHILDREN.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.700
I'M GONNA GO FRESHEN UP.
- OH, OKAY.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.633
- I OUGHT TO GET BACK
TO THE HOUSE TOO.

18:43.633 --> 18:44.500
- OKAY, BYE, MOM.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.433
- BYE, DEAR.
- BYE, DEAR.

18:48.433 --> 18:51.333
- I THINK SHE WAS
TALKING TO ME.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.500
- YEAH.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.700
I'M GONNA START
CALLING MARIE "MOM."

18:54.700 --> 18:55.867
ISN'T THAT NICE?

18:55.867 --> 18:57.033
- OH?

18:57.033 --> 19:00.467
THAT IS NICE.

19:00.467 --> 19:03.000
- YOU KNOW,
LIKE YOU AND RAYMOND.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.100
- MM-HMM.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.167
- WHAT'S WRONG?
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

19:08.167 --> 19:09.533
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NOTHING.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.367
IT JUST SOUNDED
A LITTLE STRANGE

19:11.367 --> 19:15.433
HEARING YOU CALL HER "MOM,"
BECAUSE I'M YOUR MOM.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.233
- WELL.

19:19.233 --> 19:20.500
WELL, I'M RAYMOND'S MOM,

19:20.500 --> 19:22.800
AND I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THIS.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.933
- I'M SORRY.

19:23.933 --> 19:25.233
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,

19:25.233 --> 19:27.700
BUT JUST HEARING
DEBRA SAYING THAT,

19:27.700 --> 19:31.200
IT JUST FEELS WRONG.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.800
- WELL, PARDON ME FOR SAYING IT,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.667
BUT ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL?

19:34.667 --> 19:37.400
I MEAN, HERE I AM,
READY TO EMBRACE THIS.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.433
- I KNOW, AND PARDON ME
FOR SAYING THIS,

19:40.433 --> 19:46.333
BUT MAYBE IN THIS CASE,
IT REALLY ISN'T UP TO YOU.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.967
I MEAN,

19:47.967 --> 19:51.700
WELL, HEAVEN FORBID
YOU DON'T GET YOUR WAY FOR ONCE.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.533
[laughs]

19:55.533 --> 19:56.800
- [laughs]

19:56.800 --> 19:58.367
WELL, MAY I JUST ASK,

19:58.367 --> 20:01.733
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:15.800 --> 20:20.100
- I'M JUST GOING
BY WHAT I SEE AROUND HERE.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.333
- WELL, AT LEAST
I'M ALWAYS HERE,

20:21.333 --> 20:22.433
NOT LIKE SOME MOTHERS.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.200
- WELL, SOME MOTHERS MIGHT SAY

20:24.200 --> 20:26.867
THAT YOU'RE HERE
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

20:26.867 --> 20:29.133
- OH, REALLY?

20:29.133 --> 20:30.433
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD BE OFF

20:30.433 --> 20:32.433
LIVING SOME
SWINGING SINGLE'S LIFE

20:32.433 --> 20:34.567
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE
FOR MY AGE.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.433
- SWINGING?

20:35.433 --> 20:36.933
- THAT'S RIGHT, PARTY GIRL.

20:36.933 --> 20:39.133
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

20:39.133 --> 20:41.933
THAT'S--THAT'S ENOUGH.

20:41.933 --> 20:43.300
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT MIGHT BE BEST

20:43.300 --> 20:44.600
FOR ALL CONCERNED

20:44.600 --> 20:46.267
IF WE JUST GO BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS, OKAY?

20:46.267 --> 20:49.033
NO MORE "MOM" CALLING.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.900
- WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.667
- ALL RIGHT.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.333
IT'S FINE WITH ME, BUT IF
IT'S TOO HARD FOR SOME OTHER--

20:55.333 --> 20:59.233
- OKAY!

20:59.233 --> 21:03.800
- IS IT OKAY?
'CAUSE I'M COMING OUT NOW.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.700
- I THINK WE'RE FINE.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.333
- OKAY.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.467
WELL, IF I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO CALL YOU "MOM,"

21:10.467 --> 21:12.000
THEN WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?
