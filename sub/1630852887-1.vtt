01:08.208 --> 01:12.708
In the summer of 1973,
a few miles outside of Austin, Texas,

01:12.791 --> 01:16.125
five youths were attacked
in a grisly and gruesome fashion

01:16.208 --> 01:18.583
by an unidentified madman.

01:18.666 --> 01:21.833
The shocking murders
were committed with a variety of tools,

01:21.916 --> 01:26.333
including hammers, meat hooks,
and most disturbingly, a chainsaw.

01:27.916 --> 01:30.791
There's an image in my mind
that'll never go away.

01:33.166 --> 01:37.916
Of the five young victims,
only one survived, Sally Hardesty,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.958
who after telling her story to the police,

01:40.041 --> 01:43.708
never again spoke
of the horrors she saw that day.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.541
After hearing Hardesty's account,

01:46.625 --> 01:49.208
officials released
this composite picture of the killer.

01:49.708 --> 01:51.375
Everybody was terrified.

01:51.458 --> 01:54.500
He is said to have worn
a mask made of human skin.

01:54.583 --> 01:57.708
However,
his true identity remains a mystery.

01:57.791 --> 02:00.625
For the next hour,
we'll take you on a journey

02:00.708 --> 02:04.916
into one of Texas's
most famous unsolved murders.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.125
Okay, that's $18.99,

02:23.208 --> 02:25.333
unless I can interest you
in a shirt or two.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.833
Okay. There you go.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.125
Whatever happened to her?

02:34.916 --> 02:36.125
Is she still alive?

02:37.833 --> 02:40.250
She became a ranger here in Texas.

02:40.333 --> 02:43.875
She must have looked for that maniac
for more than 30, 40 years.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.250
So she… she found him?

02:47.916 --> 02:50.000
He was wearing a mask.

02:51.166 --> 02:54.583
Not easy to locate someone
if you don't know what they look like.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.458
Hey, sis, there you are.

02:59.541 --> 03:01.291
Yeah, right where you left me, weirdo.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.041
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look, look.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.625
Something for your champagne later.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.083
You know, you don't actually
need a corkscrew for champagne.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.583
Come on. We've gotta beat the bus.

03:09.666 --> 03:12.083
Where y'all headed,
if you don't mind me asking?

03:12.708 --> 03:14.166
Uh, Harlow?

03:14.250 --> 03:16.666
-Oh. I heard about you.
-You did?

03:16.750 --> 03:18.041
Everybody has.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.041
-Y'all have a nice day now.
-Thank you.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.208
Gentri-fuckers.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.333
Here.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.250
-Where's Dante?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.333
Uh…

03:30.416 --> 03:33.291
Success!
Found a pocket of cell signal over yonder.

03:33.375 --> 03:34.416
Mm-hmm.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.041
So, apparently, the bus took
a wrong turn like 20 miles back,

03:37.125 --> 03:38.458
but we're back on track now.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.083
We're fine. We're solid.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.875
Let's get on the road. Let's go. Let's go.

03:58.916 --> 04:00.583
Look at this guy.

04:00.666 --> 04:02.041
Who has such a small dick

04:02.125 --> 04:04.625
they need to walk around
in public with a fucking gun?

04:04.708 --> 04:07.916
Like, I mean, is he compensating
for something? I mean…

04:08.000 --> 04:08.958
Come on, Mel.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.500
-Melody, don't.
-What? I'm just saying.

04:11.583 --> 04:12.958
Excuse me, ma'am.

04:13.041 --> 04:14.041
What?

04:15.458 --> 04:18.833
See, we're plagued
by feral hogs around these parts.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.000
And the only way to deal
with an invasive species

04:22.083 --> 04:23.541
is to eradicate them.

04:24.291 --> 04:25.416
On sight.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.958
Okay. Okay.
Let's go before she gets us all killed.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.625
Come on, girls. Let's go.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.750
Sorry if a big gun
makes you uncomfortable.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.208
I've seen bigger.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.833
Hey. I'm really sorry
about that back there.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.125
You don't need me
getting mad on your behalf.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.416
It's whatever.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.583
Anyway, I'm super happy you came.

05:16.625 --> 05:18.958
Mel, check out our post.
It's blowing up.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.166
Hey, guys. Today is the day!

05:23.250 --> 05:27.000
We're finally giving birth
to this crazy dream Mel and I had.

05:27.083 --> 05:30.583
A real change is here, so thank you all.

05:30.666 --> 05:32.166
Can't wait to see you in Harlow.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.500
Oh, it's gonna be great. Think about it.

05:34.583 --> 05:37.416
We can own all of this,
call it "Dantopia."

05:37.500 --> 05:38.458
What?

05:38.541 --> 05:40.250
What? Dantopia.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.375
How long have you been sitting on that?

05:42.458 --> 05:43.958
Like the last 48 hours.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.708
I get it. Dante and Utop--
You're combining the words.

05:46.791 --> 05:49.166
-I was just joking.
-I see what-- What the fuck?

05:51.875 --> 05:53.416
-What's wrong with him?

05:53.500 --> 05:55.458
Look, Melody, it's your boyfriend.

05:55.541 --> 05:58.416
-What a fucking psycho.
-Texas mating ritual.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.208
-Seriously, what is wrong with that guy?

06:01.291 --> 06:03.375
He's just a fucking coal roller.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.333
Oh, great, they don't
pull over the psycho, but they stop us?

06:13.208 --> 06:16.250
-Put your hands where they can see 'em.
-That's not funny.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.541
There's a 10-12 at the location.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.333
Copy that.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.416
Howdy.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.666
Hey, how you doing? I'm Dante Spivey.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.208
You're the cook.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.625
The chef. Uh, we both are.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.875
-Hi.
-And who else you have in there?

06:38.375 --> 06:40.000
Well, this is my future wife.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.833
And my sister back here.

06:43.708 --> 06:44.958
Is everything okay?

06:45.541 --> 06:47.541
I know you got
a lot of folks coming through,

06:47.625 --> 06:49.791
so me and my deputy are gonna hang around

06:49.875 --> 06:52.125
to make sure y'all stay out of trouble.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.958
Call me if there are any issues.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.375
Sure. We have your number, and, uh,

06:58.458 --> 07:00.833
we thank you for your service, sir.

07:01.416 --> 07:02.750
Let's just go.

07:02.833 --> 07:06.416
Listen, some of us
were born here, you know.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.625
Saw it in its prime.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.666
So please, be respectful for the town.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.458
We will, sir.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.958
Melody, what are you doing?

07:20.041 --> 07:24.291
You know, our… our grandmother
was actually from around here.

07:25.208 --> 07:28.291
You know, "When Harlow sunflower blooms…"

07:28.375 --> 07:29.916
"Winter is doomed."

07:30.000 --> 07:30.958
Yeah.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.500
Okay.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.416
Welcome to Harlow.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.041
Thank you.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.500
Woo!

07:52.916 --> 07:56.416
Finally, we made it. Welcome to Harlow.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.916
Behold the joys of late-stage capitalism.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.625
Woo!

08:24.708 --> 08:25.625
Oh!

08:26.416 --> 08:29.708
Holy shit, babe. This is amazing.

08:29.791 --> 08:32.166
So Harlow is a ghost town.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.750
Yes, but we have a vision for this place.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.333
All it needs is young blood,

08:36.416 --> 08:39.458
people like us, tired of the big city,
looking for a fresh start.

08:39.541 --> 08:42.166
Dante, for what we were paying
to park the food trucks in Austin,

08:42.250 --> 08:44.500
we get the whole corner over there.
That is insane.

08:44.583 --> 08:45.958
Our restaurant will be first,

08:46.041 --> 08:48.416
and we have to just
inspire more people to follow.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.041
-We will.
-We definitely will.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.083
This space would be perfect
for my art gallery.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.500
Lila, look, we could put a comic book
store in here or something… cool.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.458
Lit.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.458
This is a chance for people
to start fresh somewhere

09:02.541 --> 09:04.458
without the violence and the madness.

09:04.541 --> 09:05.541
Somewhere safe.

09:06.166 --> 09:09.708
Okay. And, I mean, seven hours by car?

09:09.791 --> 09:12.083
I guess I can say goodbye
to my friends forever.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.500
Oh Christ.

09:17.083 --> 09:18.666
What is he doing here?

09:22.333 --> 09:23.375
Excuse me.

09:25.541 --> 09:29.250
Oh shit, sorry, uh, Richter.
We spoke on the phone.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.708
-Yeah.
-Dante.

09:30.791 --> 09:31.625
Hey.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.583
Uh, Richter's our contractor, Mel.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.166
Gave your buildings a facelift,

09:39.250 --> 09:40.875
about all I can do in a week.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.875
It looks good for the auction. Thank you.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.083
You're planning to sell these?

09:45.166 --> 09:46.708
-Oh yeah, we will.
-Mm-hmm.

09:46.791 --> 09:47.791
All right.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.416
So you guys are what? Like, a cult?

09:53.375 --> 09:58.291
We are idealistic individuals
who want to build a better world.

09:58.375 --> 09:59.750
Yeah, that's a cult.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.500
-What?
-It's all right, not judging.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.833
Just pay me. We're good.

10:10.083 --> 10:13.000
Hey guys, you should, uh…
you should see this.

10:14.041 --> 10:14.875
What?

10:14.958 --> 10:16.750
-Oh…
-Oh shit.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.208
What?

10:22.541 --> 10:23.541
Are you serious?

10:24.083 --> 10:26.500
-Newsflash, we're in deep Texas.
-I don't care.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.041
We have a bus full of
potential investors on the way.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.916
They see this flag, they're not gonna buy.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.541
-Trust me.
-I'm getting the cowboy.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.791
Mel, help me.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.291
I'll just be here.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.750
-Hmm…

10:47.166 --> 10:48.875
Um, I'm going upstairs.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.333
Look at this place. It's weird.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.708
Ah, shit.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.791
Damn, I couldn't reach it.

11:28.541 --> 11:32.125
-Oh shit. Well, what are we going to do?
-Let's just wait for the contractor.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.875
What are you doing in our house?

11:35.500 --> 11:37.833
Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

11:37.916 --> 11:39.833
We thought this place was empty.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.125
Oh, you're the new neighbors, aren't you?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.333
Uh…

11:56.708 --> 11:58.708
Wish I'd known y'all were coming.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.875
I'd have put my face on.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.416
Sweet tea?

12:12.833 --> 12:16.375
I've been running this orphanage
for nearly 50 years.

12:16.458 --> 12:20.583
I've housed boys and girls
in need of a loving home,

12:20.666 --> 12:25.500
and troubled teens that needed me
to show 'em mercy for their ways.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.375
Please.

12:28.458 --> 12:33.708
Ma'am, the bank, um,
reclaimed this property months ago.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.375
You're not supposed to be here.

12:39.583 --> 12:43.250
You talking about
that whole mix up with the bank?

12:43.333 --> 12:44.958
That's been settled.

12:45.875 --> 12:49.583
I paid everything I owed.
This is still our house.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.708
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but--

12:51.791 --> 12:54.083
I've got a title that says otherwise.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.791
Do you mind if we see that?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.666
I don't have to show you anything.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.875
-That's because you don't have it.
-Dante, don't.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.416
What? Was this about my flag?

13:09.791 --> 13:11.500
You got me all wrong.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.750
I've taken care of
many boys like you over the years.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.208
I don't have a problem with Negroes.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.708
Okay. Fuck this.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.541
You watch your mouth, boy.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.041
You watch yours.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.375
Where are you going?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.875
Let the cops deal with her.
I don't have time for this.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.708
I'm getting the sheriff.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.458
It's not what you think.

13:36.500 --> 13:40.041
That flag belonged to my great granddaddy.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.458
It reminds me of him.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.375
I haven't given it much thought.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.875
I… I understand your friend.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.625
I wish I could help you,
but you can't be here.

13:57.708 --> 14:00.625
-There are shelters for the elderly, and…

14:00.708 --> 14:04.708
Shelter? I'm not going anywhere.

14:04.791 --> 14:08.041
I told you. This is our house.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.041
Look, you'll be safer in a home
and better taken care of.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.375
A woman your age shouldn't be on her own.

14:17.458 --> 14:21.666
Baby, I'm fine. I'm all right.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.125
Just go back to your room.

14:25.916 --> 14:28.375
He's the last of my boys.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.666
He needs special care.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.875
He doesn't do well outside,
you understand that?

14:32.958 --> 14:34.750
It's why I can't ever leave here.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.250
Christ, Ginny, why are you still here?

14:41.625 --> 14:43.250
What have you done?

14:43.333 --> 14:44.916
Virginia, we told you weeks ago.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.958
She ain't listening.
Let's get her outta here.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.375
-We'll talk about it outside.
-Come on. Let's go.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.666
Take it easy.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.958
I barely touched her.

14:53.958 --> 14:57.791
Oh my God. What is happening?
We need to call an ambulance.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.333
We are the ambulance.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.208
It's all right. It's her boy.

15:02.416 --> 15:05.125
Grab the oxygen.
Put her in the van.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.083
She's having a heart attack.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.291
The check… It was… Please…

15:10.375 --> 15:11.625
Hey, hey, what did you do?

15:11.708 --> 15:14.333
We'll get you to
the hospital in no time. Just hold on.

15:14.416 --> 15:16.958
Shit. The bus is here.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.458
-Fuck.

15:18.541 --> 15:19.750
I'm going with her.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.416
No, Melody, no, no, no.
I'll go with her. I'll go.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.375
What?

15:23.458 --> 15:25.375
Everyone's expecting
to see the two of you.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.333
She'll be okay.

15:26.416 --> 15:27.291
Come on.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.666
-Christ.
-Somebody needs to.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.375
It can't be Melody, can't be you.

15:31.458 --> 15:34.958
You need to focus on this.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.416
Okay. Please just
make sure she's all right.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.125
Thank you. You're an angel.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.291
Let's move.

15:55.541 --> 15:56.958
Here's your flag.

16:02.541 --> 16:05.208
Come on, Mel.
We'll get somebody to clean that up.

16:08.708 --> 16:10.750
Did that not feel like a bad omen to you?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.041
This place is cursed now.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.833
Please, this is not--

16:13.916 --> 16:16.291
I don't need this right now,
so… it's all good.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.458
If you move here,
I'm moving back with Dad.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.458
No, you're not.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.666
I… I don't want to live here.
Your whole idea is insane.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.541
-You don't know what you want.
-Okay, and you do?

16:28.833 --> 16:31.750
Uh, I know you need me,
and you can't take care of yourself.

16:33.541 --> 16:34.541
Wait.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.541
Why did I…?

16:39.375 --> 16:41.875
Honestly, the bank
could've never dreamed of selling these

16:41.958 --> 16:43.166
without your help, Dante.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.166
-Thank you for trusting us.
-It's amazing.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.541
Absolutely. Um…

16:46.625 --> 16:48.708
Mel! Mel! Catherine, come here.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.833
This is Catherine,
you know, from the bank.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.708
-She made all this possible.

16:53.791 --> 16:55.833
Finally. It's nice to meet you.

16:57.208 --> 17:01.083
You know, everyone is super excited.
You guys did a great job promoting this.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.958
Yeah, just needs a fresh coat of paint.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.125
Oh no, it is perfect like this.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.708
These people want the wear-down.
You know, the history?

17:07.791 --> 17:08.833
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.833
-This is going to be great.
-Yeah.

17:10.916 --> 17:13.833
I'm just going to start
setting up, so… Okay.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.208
Is she all right?

17:16.291 --> 17:18.458
Yeah, I think the heat's
just getting to her a bit.

17:18.541 --> 17:19.500
It's so hot out here.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.750
-Probably needed a little water.
-Yeah. It's hot.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.000
How's she doing?

17:34.166 --> 17:39.666
Baby, who's the good boy
I taught you to be?

17:41.125 --> 17:43.125
Stay out of my room.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.250
Shit.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.333
Sheriff, I think she croaked.

18:05.416 --> 18:07.041
Son of a bitch.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.625
-Oh my God.

18:26.666 --> 18:27.583
Hey.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.666
No!

18:47.333 --> 18:48.625
What the hell's going on?

18:54.666 --> 18:56.166
Oh my God!

19:06.125 --> 19:08.416
And sold to Candace Brady
of Brady's Brunch.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.625
Aw! I love brunch. That's great.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.208
Well, this was built in 1910,

19:14.291 --> 19:18.166
and once counted President Howard Taft
as a distinguished guest.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.583
Got a high chance of thunderstorms,

19:25.666 --> 19:26.916
lightning, and heavy rain.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.375
Stay dry out there.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.500
So, Richter…

19:34.291 --> 19:36.000
why are you such a nihilist?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.458
A what?

19:37.541 --> 19:40.666
I mean, anyone who blasts diesel
into the atmosphere like that

19:40.750 --> 19:43.875
truly gives zero fucks
about, like, anything.

19:43.958 --> 19:44.958
I'm a Texan.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.291
I don't like people telling me what to do,

19:48.375 --> 19:52.708
especially smug,
self-righteous, rich, city folk.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.291
Is it loaded?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.541
Ever shot one before?

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
No.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.541
Been shot at.

20:30.541 --> 20:31.666
Drunk dad?

20:33.916 --> 20:35.083
Stonebrook High.

20:47.291 --> 20:50.500
That must be tough, living with that.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.291
I mean…

20:56.708 --> 21:00.416
Everyone expects me
to do something special with my life now,

21:00.958 --> 21:05.375
and I can only disappoint them.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.833
My friends were the special ones.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.208
Not me.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.083
Please stick around for music and drinks.

21:19.166 --> 21:22.500
We have a lot to celebrate.
Thank you all so much.

21:31.250 --> 21:35.375
Come on, Mel. Have a drink with me.
We did it. We did it. What a dream.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.583
What?

21:41.291 --> 21:42.250
Damn.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.041
Damn? That's…
That's all you have to say?

21:48.750 --> 21:50.291
We just killed her.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.500
Heart disease killed her. Mel.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.333
Where you going, Mel?

21:55.416 --> 21:57.666
I'm getting Lila
and taking her out of here. Okay?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.416
This just doesn't feel right anymore.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.416
Wait. Wait.
Mel, this wasn't our fault. Mel!

22:03.333 --> 22:04.291
Lila?

22:17.833 --> 22:18.833
Where's my sister?

22:27.333 --> 22:28.333
We're leaving.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.250
Okay.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.333
Really? That guy?
Are you kidding me?

22:32.416 --> 22:34.583
-You think I fucked him?
-I don't know. Did you?

22:34.666 --> 22:35.833
I just used the bathroom.

22:35.916 --> 22:38.625
I know you think I'm a total train wreck,
but give me a break. Please.

22:38.708 --> 22:39.666
I'm sorry.

22:41.125 --> 22:42.166
The old lady died.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.375
I really need you
to leave with me right now. Okay?

22:46.458 --> 22:47.833
Can you do that, please?

22:47.916 --> 22:49.583
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.625
Put that shit out.

24:12.833 --> 24:13.916
Hello.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.291
Hello.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.541
Hello, please.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.333
Is anybody there?

24:24.416 --> 24:25.541
Please.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.666
I am hurt. I have been in an accident.

24:29.916 --> 24:35.583
Please, I'm on Route 74, outside Harlow.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.416
Oh my God.

24:50.416 --> 24:52.875
Oh my God. He's… He's cutting…

25:17.625 --> 25:20.375
He's wearing her face.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.166
He's wearing her face.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.750
-No, no. Shh. Please.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
You sure you're not
gonna stay for the party?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.041
-Yeah, I'm just not really feeling well.
-Okay.

28:40.125 --> 28:41.250
Just the heat, you know?

28:41.333 --> 28:43.041
-Yeah.
-Take the car. I'll take the bus back.

28:43.125 --> 28:46.125
Wait. What the fuck? What the--

28:46.208 --> 28:48.208
-Hey!
-Hey. What?

28:49.083 --> 28:50.541
What the fuck are you doing?

28:51.333 --> 28:52.833
Heard you killed that lady.

28:54.291 --> 28:57.250
We didn't kill anybody.
She was trespassing on our property.

28:57.333 --> 29:01.125
You sure that was your property?
Huh? Looked like she disagreed.

29:01.208 --> 29:02.791
Please just give us back the keys.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.000
Give me the keys.

29:05.666 --> 29:09.125
Show me you have the deed
to that house, you'll have them back.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.541
I'll be in the shop.

29:13.375 --> 29:14.875
That fucking guy.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.458
Just give him what he wants.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.500
-Let's keep the bank out of this.
-Please tell me you have it.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.375
I do. I have it.

29:31.166 --> 29:32.500
Then where is it?

29:34.500 --> 29:38.625
It… It must be at the office.
Back in Austin.

29:38.708 --> 29:39.583
Dante.

29:39.666 --> 29:41.875
Some deeds took
longer than others to process.

29:41.958 --> 29:43.958
Tell me we didn't
kick her out of her own house.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.666
We didn't. I'm telling you.
It must be back at the office.

29:46.750 --> 29:50.708
Hey, if that's true,
then it can't be in the house, right?

29:53.416 --> 29:54.833
All right, you stay here. Let's go.

29:54.916 --> 29:57.291
Hey, wait, can you
just relax for a second?

29:57.375 --> 29:59.916
I'll never relax until
I'm sure we're on the right side of this.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.083
-I'm coming with.
-No, please.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.291
Just do what I tell you?

30:03.375 --> 30:06.083
-Why do I have to stay with these people?
-Please just stay.

30:07.458 --> 30:08.791
Come on, let's go.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.583
This is bullshit.

30:15.791 --> 30:18.166
Hey there, I'm calling for Hardesty.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.083
Sure, I'll hold.

30:43.333 --> 30:44.666
This is Hardesty.

31:51.583 --> 31:53.666
You look down here. I'll check upstairs.

32:07.791 --> 32:08.791
Okay…

33:00.125 --> 33:01.041
Is that it?

33:51.791 --> 33:53.000
Da-- Dante?

34:01.250 --> 34:02.291
Da-- Dante?

34:15.375 --> 34:16.416
Mel?

36:48.833 --> 36:51.500
I hope everyone
is having a great time out there.

36:51.583 --> 36:52.916
We've gotten lots done!

36:53.000 --> 36:55.791
This town is ours! DJ…

37:57.666 --> 37:59.458
Okay, everybody on the bus.

37:59.541 --> 38:01.125
Party continues on the bus.

38:01.208 --> 38:04.000
Get in the bus. Everyone in the bus.

39:33.291 --> 39:34.375
To Harlow!

39:36.125 --> 39:39.333
Has anyone seen Dante? I'll go get him.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.375
Let me top you off there.

40:01.041 --> 40:02.000
Dante?

40:02.791 --> 40:03.666
Hey.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.125
What were you doing in that house?

40:09.041 --> 40:11.458
Hey, I'm talking to you.

40:11.541 --> 40:13.166
Don't walk away from me.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.166
Hey, man, you okay?

40:28.250 --> 40:30.083
Here, I gotcha. I got you.

40:32.500 --> 40:33.833
What happened to him?

40:38.125 --> 40:39.041
Oh my God.

40:39.125 --> 40:41.250
Who did this to you, huh?

40:42.125 --> 40:44.541
Hold on. Hey, don't let go. Don't let go.

40:47.541 --> 40:48.875
Oh my God.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.958
Call the cops. You hear me?

40:53.041 --> 40:54.458
Keep everyone on the bus.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.208
-Go on.
-Okay.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.166
Go on now.

41:09.875 --> 41:11.583
Shut the door. Keep it closed.

41:11.666 --> 41:12.625
What happened?

41:12.708 --> 41:15.333
I don't know.
Just keep the door closed.

43:02.333 --> 43:03.791
What the fuck?

43:10.083 --> 43:11.708
Ah!

43:36.708 --> 43:37.916
-Ah!

45:20.750 --> 45:22.958
We have a report of a dead body in Harlow.

45:23.666 --> 45:25.500
Come on, Naiman, you there?

45:25.583 --> 45:27.958
You're the only guys
I have in a 50-mile radius.

45:31.708 --> 45:34.083
We need an officer in Harlow.

45:35.416 --> 45:36.541
Please respond.

46:11.083 --> 46:14.208
I fear no evil. I fear no evil.

46:49.375 --> 46:51.208
Stay in your seat, please.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.875
-What's happening?
-Just trust me.

46:53.958 --> 46:55.208
Stay in your seat.

46:56.458 --> 46:58.500
-Please open the door.
-Don't.

47:02.041 --> 47:03.041
Fuck this.

47:03.833 --> 47:05.250
Where are you going?

47:06.833 --> 47:08.916
Melody? Mel?

47:15.916 --> 47:17.125
Oh my…

50:11.708 --> 50:12.625
Mel?

50:12.708 --> 50:14.458
-No. No, Lila.
-Melody?

50:14.541 --> 50:18.208
-Mel? Melody? Mel?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.583
-Melody! Melody?
-Lila!

50:37.666 --> 50:38.666
Lila, go!

50:45.250 --> 50:46.750
Oh my God. Melody.

50:47.333 --> 50:50.333
Help! Lila! Lila! Help!

50:53.041 --> 50:55.375
I got you. Come on. Come on.

50:57.500 --> 50:58.708
Melody?

51:02.458 --> 51:03.458
Wait.

51:04.208 --> 51:05.375
Run!

51:15.833 --> 51:18.000
Wake up. Wake up!

51:22.791 --> 51:25.000
-What happened?

51:25.083 --> 51:27.916
Fucking drive! Drive!

51:29.500 --> 51:31.791
-Whoa, are you okay?

51:31.875 --> 51:35.625
Wait. Wait. What the fuck is happening?

51:36.875 --> 51:37.750
Melody?

51:38.791 --> 51:39.833
Fuck.

51:41.333 --> 51:43.416
-Get us out of here.

51:44.208 --> 51:45.458
Let's go! Let's go!

51:53.583 --> 51:55.208
-Go this way.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.750
Come on. Keep going.

52:04.250 --> 52:08.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't stop. No, no, no, no.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.833
Don't open the--
Dude, where are you going?

52:13.625 --> 52:15.041
-What's happening?

52:15.125 --> 52:16.666
-No, no, no.
-Melody?

52:37.375 --> 52:39.833
This party is really good, right?

52:41.208 --> 52:42.250
You okay?

52:42.333 --> 52:43.166
Run.

52:43.666 --> 52:45.541
No.

52:52.791 --> 52:54.166
Look at this freak show.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.208
Bro, what are you doing?

53:00.791 --> 53:04.250
-Try anything and you're canceled, bro.

53:07.458 --> 53:08.916
Oh, fuck.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Oh God!

54:12.625 --> 54:13.583
Get up.

54:13.666 --> 54:16.208
Lila! Lila, get up. I got you.

55:01.750 --> 55:02.666
Look.

55:19.583 --> 55:20.416
-Ah!

55:42.125 --> 55:43.083
Melody?

55:44.375 --> 55:46.333
-Melody?
-Lila, I can't.

55:46.416 --> 55:47.333
Fuck!

55:50.958 --> 55:52.291
Come on, Melody. You gotta!

55:55.125 --> 55:58.416
Come on, Melody. Holy shit!

55:59.375 --> 56:01.750
Come on. Melody, come on, please.

56:04.083 --> 56:05.333
Oh my God!

56:05.416 --> 56:07.666
Come on! Come on!

56:08.166 --> 56:10.666
-I got you. Come on.

56:12.083 --> 56:14.291
We gotta get down. Lila, let's go!

56:20.458 --> 56:22.208
Melody, I got you. Come on.

56:27.833 --> 56:31.833
-Help!
-Oh my God. Help. Help!

56:31.916 --> 56:33.875
Come on. Get in the back.

56:39.333 --> 56:42.458
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

56:46.833 --> 56:49.583
He just… He killed… Dante.

56:49.666 --> 56:50.958
It's him, isn't it?

56:51.500 --> 56:53.041
He killed everyone.

56:53.708 --> 56:55.166
Leatherface.

56:57.541 --> 56:59.500
What? What? Please drive.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.125
What are you doing? What?

57:02.208 --> 57:03.625
-Drive!
-Please, go!

57:03.708 --> 57:06.333
Fifty years I've been waiting
for this night.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.333
Just to see him again.

57:09.416 --> 57:10.625
She locked us in.

57:10.708 --> 57:12.958
Please drive.
You have to let us out of here.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.291
I'm sorry, I can't.

57:14.958 --> 57:16.666
Looks like it's you that he wants.

57:17.333 --> 57:20.000
You need to stay until I kill him.

57:20.083 --> 57:24.083
-No, no, no.
-No, please. Please, no!

57:26.666 --> 57:28.416
Please, please, help.

57:28.500 --> 57:31.791
No, don't. What? No.

57:31.875 --> 57:35.250
No, please.
Please, please, please let us out!

57:35.333 --> 57:36.250
Please. No!

57:37.875 --> 57:42.916
-No! No! Don't leave! No!

57:43.541 --> 57:46.916
No, please. No! No, you can't.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.458
You can't leave us. No!

57:49.541 --> 57:52.916
No. What the fuck?

58:53.958 --> 58:55.041
Turn around.

59:03.541 --> 59:10.375
Kirk, Pamela, Jerry, and Franklin.

59:22.916 --> 59:24.125
Say my name.

59:27.458 --> 59:28.458
Say you know me.

59:29.791 --> 59:32.291
Say you know what you did to my friends.

59:40.916 --> 59:42.541
You don't remember me.

1:00:00.541 --> 1:00:01.666
Fuck.

1:00:03.208 --> 1:00:06.958
You know, I was supposed
to die in the school that day.

1:00:09.666 --> 1:00:11.250
So death followed me here.

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:13.625
Death… Look at me.

1:00:17.250 --> 1:00:19.958
I'm not going to let him kill you, okay?
I prom--

1:00:29.375 --> 1:00:31.291
-No! No!

1:00:39.541 --> 1:00:41.416
Remember me now?

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:43.416
I'm the one that got away,

1:00:43.500 --> 1:00:45.666
and I'm here to make sure you don't.

1:00:46.583 --> 1:00:47.833
Motherfucker.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:55.416
-Get the fuck out of here.

1:01:11.041 --> 1:01:12.000
Come on.

1:01:26.250 --> 1:01:27.750
What are you doing?

1:02:01.916 --> 1:02:03.791
-Put your seat belt on.
-Fuck.

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:14.791
Fuck you!

1:02:46.291 --> 1:02:47.416
Oh my God.

1:02:49.791 --> 1:02:53.208
-Fuck. Oh God. I--
-Oh, Melody.

1:02:53.958 --> 1:02:56.583
No, don't touch it. Oh, I can't.

1:02:58.500 --> 1:02:59.458
I can't.

1:03:02.458 --> 1:03:03.375
Melody, he's coming.

1:03:03.458 --> 1:03:07.000
-Lila. Lila, listen. Listen.
-No, come on. I gotta get you out of this.

1:03:07.083 --> 1:03:08.666
-I can get you out.
-Listen. Listen!

1:03:10.833 --> 1:03:14.000
He's gonna kill me right now.
I'm sorry, there's no other way.

1:03:14.083 --> 1:03:15.875
But you, you have to run.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:16.833
No. I can't.

1:03:16.916 --> 1:03:19.375
I don't have anyone else.
I can't leave you.

1:03:19.458 --> 1:03:20.541
Yes, you can.

1:03:20.625 --> 1:03:22.583
You're the strongest person I know, okay?

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:24.041
You never needed me.

1:03:26.166 --> 1:03:28.708
You can do this.
You just have to fucking run.

1:03:29.333 --> 1:03:30.916
Fucking run.

1:03:32.416 --> 1:03:33.541
Run!

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:58.208
I'm sorry.

1:04:00.416 --> 1:04:02.041
For what I did to your mama.

1:04:05.041 --> 1:04:06.500
She didn't deserve that.

1:04:19.208 --> 1:04:20.166
Hey, Leatherfuck.

1:04:25.833 --> 1:04:26.750
Shit.

1:04:28.750 --> 1:04:30.000
Lila!

1:04:42.333 --> 1:04:43.250
No!

1:05:00.833 --> 1:05:01.791
-Lila?

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:04.666
Lila! Lila?

1:05:08.875 --> 1:05:09.958
Thank you. Thank you.

1:05:10.041 --> 1:05:11.083
Don't run.

1:05:16.625 --> 1:05:17.666
Don't run.

1:05:18.666 --> 1:05:19.916
If you run…

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:26.916
he'll never stop haunting you.

1:05:36.416 --> 1:05:37.541
Lila!

1:05:39.458 --> 1:05:40.416
Lila.

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:52.625
Lila! Lila, help me!

1:08:21.750 --> 1:08:22.833
Oh, fuck.

1:09:12.875 --> 1:09:15.625
Lila. Lila, where are you?

1:09:17.666 --> 1:09:19.333
No! No!

1:09:20.541 --> 1:09:21.583
No! No!

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.000
Melody!

1:10:24.875 --> 1:10:25.958
Ah!

1:12:05.541 --> 1:12:07.000
Are you… Are you okay?

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.041
No.

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:00.708
Oh.

1:13:04.375 --> 1:13:05.875
Oh, fuck.

1:13:07.166 --> 1:13:08.208
Okay.

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:18.541
Let's go home.

1:13:18.625 --> 1:13:20.375
Autopilot engaged.

1:13:20.458 --> 1:13:21.583
Fuck Harlow.

1:13:22.208 --> 1:13:23.458
Hey, you know what?

1:13:23.541 --> 1:13:26.250
I changed my mind, actually.
I'll move here with you.

1:13:26.333 --> 1:13:27.708
Fuck off.

1:13:28.250 --> 1:13:29.791
-Fuck.
-No!

1:13:29.875 --> 1:13:31.708
-No! Melody! No!

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:34.375
No!

1:13:38.541 --> 1:13:40.166
No! No!

1:13:42.083 --> 1:13:44.541
No! Melody!

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:46.041
No!

1:13:47.166 --> 1:13:48.375
No.
