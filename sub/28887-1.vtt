00:18.094 --> 00:20.014
The crime rates have risen in LA.

00:20.179 --> 00:24.349
In the second city of the country meant that 20 percent of violent crimes.

00:25.810 --> 00:29.650
LA 280 homicides committed. An increase of 10 percent last year.

00:29.814 --> 00:32.183
The number of rapes rose by 6.4 percent ...

00:32.357 --> 00:35.358
and aggravated assault by more than 27 percent.

00:54.130 --> 00:57.930
All 21 LAPD divisions reporting a rise in crime.

00:58.092 --> 01:02.722
According to the police gang-related violence contributed to it.

01:17.403 --> 01:20.483
How many are there? - A four or maybe five.

01:20.656 --> 01:22.826
They never look really good.

01:22.992 --> 01:26.962
That cunt dealers can get typhoid. - Let's do it.

01:35.755 --> 01:41.965
Thus, Redman, Redhead, Redlock or whatever you may call ...

01:42.136 --> 01:43.536
what are you going to do?

02:11.165 --> 02:14.545
What do you think? - Let's do it.

02:21.801 --> 02:26.101
So you want everything? - Indeed.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.577
Stand still. Hands up. Do not move.

02:54.166 --> 02:57.586
Please. Grab whatever you want.

03:27.074 --> 03:33.664
Another time when laws were introduced was in Mesopotamia «rs.

03:33.831 --> 03:37.341
In that period Hammurabi introduced a law.

03:37.501 --> 03:39.631
And what law was that?

03:39.795 --> 03:43.085
If anyone injured another upper class ...

03:43.257 --> 03:45.384
then this was punished with the same injury.

03:45.509 --> 03:50.349
'Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth.' Who does the text not?

03:50.514 --> 03:55.054
So ethics is an important part of the system.

03:55.227 --> 04:00.937
We're a social system that needs ethical and moral boundaries.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.358
And so arose the law ...

04:03.527 --> 04:06.072
because people who go to outside the system.

04:06.197 --> 04:11.957
If a government can no longer restrain her group Judicial ...

04:12.119 --> 04:14.209
then the government overthrown.

04:14.372 --> 04:18.882
Should our government do not leave? - Explain?

04:19.043 --> 04:21.083
There is no justice anymore.

04:21.253 --> 04:25.333
Most laws are made so that they keep criminals out of jail.

04:25.508 --> 04:29.718
And the police is innocent and minorities tricky.

04:29.887 --> 04:35.437
I know what you mean. But here we have a fair trial.

04:35.601 --> 04:37.395
You are innocent until proven otherwise.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.820
So you have a chance to show that you've done nothing wrong.

04:42.983 --> 04:49.233
But in the end we have to live in one of the most prosperous countries in the world.

04:49.407 --> 04:51.787
We all have the chance of a good education.

04:51.951 --> 04:56.041
So I believe in the justice system. And I think it is important.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.587
My God.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.520
HÃ ©, baby. I'm late, I know. Sorry.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.770
We are too late. We stuck in traffic. There must an accident.

05:16.934 --> 05:18.804
You also come too late?

05:18.978 --> 05:23.108
How's my baby? You now have summer vacation, huh?

05:23.274 --> 05:25.604
Yes. Traffic is cunt, Dad.

05:25.776 --> 05:30.866
From whom did you learn that? Audra, you have taught her?

05:31.031 --> 05:34.911
No, she has yours. - Yeah, give me the blame.

05:36.412 --> 05:39.792
I think we can get better and continue running.

05:39.957 --> 05:42.377
No, do but easy.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.123
I had not started eating.

05:45.296 --> 05:48.796
Do not worry. I'll do that. I like cooking, you know.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.596
Thanks sweetheart.

05:51.260 --> 05:55.140
I'm going to hang. I need to figure out how to get there.

05:55.306 --> 05:59.766
You have a GPS? - I know the way home, Nolan.

05:59.935 --> 06:02.685
I think I can stand out a bit.

06:02.855 --> 06:06.235
Be careful. - I love you.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.780
I love you, Dad. - Me too.

06:12.364 --> 06:17.704
Sorry, honey. What I'm doing? Where are we?

06:51.320 --> 06:53.620
No bullshit. Give me the dope.

06:53.781 --> 06:57.411
I have nothing on me. - Oh no? What is this?

06:57.576 --> 07:00.416
Enter. - I think it's just fine.

07:00.579 --> 07:03.919
I knew you was dealing.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.703
It's different.

07:09.046 --> 07:14.506
Come on. Wait. That's a nice joint. So I use.

07:16.595 --> 07:18.555
Mommy, what's that?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.438
Yo, Trigger.

08:01.640 --> 08:06.860
Audra, with me. Call me if you have time. I love you.

08:16.822 --> 08:20.242
She's still not home.

08:20.409 --> 08:23.959
My daughter is with her.

08:24.121 --> 08:28.461
How long before I can return?

08:31.295 --> 08:36.505
I understand. That's okay ©. Thanks.

08:36.674 --> 08:39.174
Good. Day.

08:39.345 --> 08:45.515
Audra, with me. I called a few times. Call me when you get this.

08:45.684 --> 08:48.474
I'm looking for you.

08:54.485 --> 08:57.695
Jesus, Audra, I was worried sick.

09:02.118 --> 09:06.078
Dr. Nolan Cooray? - Ja.

09:06.247 --> 09:12.547
I'm Detective Chuck Bryant and this is Detective Emily Plaza.

09:13.546 --> 09:15.176
We...

09:16.507 --> 09:18.847
We are sorry that we ...

09:19.009 --> 09:25.189
Dr. Cooray, it's about your wife and daughter, I fear.

09:25.349 --> 09:27.269
No...

09:31.981 --> 09:34.611
Recognize anyone?

09:35.818 --> 09:38.068
Take your time.

09:40.865 --> 09:43.075
The there.

09:45.202 --> 09:49.412
The third from the left? Good.

09:50.374 --> 09:52.454
Thank you.

09:54.086 --> 09:58.966
Your family was witness to a murder by a gang.

09:59.133 --> 10:02.093
They were shot in their turn because they ...

10:02.261 --> 10:06.691
the identity of the perpetrator wanted to keep secret.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.644
Was it therefore?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.475
Your family was at the wrong time in the wrong place.

10:17.318 --> 10:20.278
We're gonna get him.

10:21.739 --> 10:22.949
More we can do.

10:23.115 --> 10:27.075
And the only reason they were murdered?

10:30.706 --> 10:35.506
I've been more than eight years in Homicide ...

10:35.669 --> 10:39.719
but believe me, this is never a good reason.

10:41.675 --> 10:46.215
We'll do our best.

10:46.389 --> 10:51.099
There was a witness who can identify.

10:51.268 --> 10:56.188
And there is a suspect in custody.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.694
I want to see him.

11:00.903 --> 11:04.983
Can I see him? - Good.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.410
I register it ...

11:09.578 --> 11:12.498
and then I will arrange that for you.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.043
Thank you.

11:16.210 --> 11:19.340
Can you come with me? - Thank you.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.139
I think it's really bad. - Thank you.

11:32.226 --> 11:35.266
I will ask you a few questions.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.319
Amanda.

11:40.484 --> 11:44.024
Date of birth? - June 4, 1987.

11:52.288 --> 11:57.338
Everything you do or say will be recorded.

11:57.501 --> 12:02.011
Then it's good that I'm fascinated and whisper.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.257
Are you Catholic, Trigger?

12:07.428 --> 12:10.888
Until I came to my senses.

12:11.057 --> 12:16.267
Trigger is your birth name?

12:18.147 --> 12:21.607
Am I arrested?

12:22.485 --> 12:25.655
Yes, I would say so.

12:25.821 --> 12:28.541
This will be a very different conversation.

12:28.699 --> 12:32.289
You are arrested and you will be heard.

12:32.453 --> 12:34.533
What's the charge?

12:34.705 --> 12:38.375
Let's see: violence ...

12:38.542 --> 12:42.332
attempted murder and perhaps even murder.

12:42.505 --> 12:45.585
Fortunately, you have not caught me wrong cross.

12:45.758 --> 12:51.098
There were other culprits, but our witness could not identify them.

12:51.263 --> 12:55.593
We assume that they belong Triggers gang.

12:55.768 --> 13:00.108
And if we put him ...

13:00.272 --> 13:04.102
He wants to maybe rat in exchange for a reduced sentence.

13:04.276 --> 13:10.946
I used zoÃ¶loog. I loved to work with your mother.

13:11.117 --> 13:16.787
I am sure that you put a child like needles into butterflies.

13:19.125 --> 13:24.625
The viceroyvlinder is nontoxic. He looks exactly like the monarch butterfly.

13:24.797 --> 13:30.217
Those orange are very toxic. Birds do not eat them, because then they will die.

13:30.386 --> 13:33.636
They leave the monarch alone, as he looks out poisonous.

13:33.806 --> 13:38.436
If you are inside laying on the street, a bird will not eat.

13:39.812 --> 13:44.112
That should also fascinate you, because you are talking to a monarch.

13:44.650 --> 13:48.740
Believe me, remission, he can write on his belly.

13:51.490 --> 13:55.620
This is all ridiculous hassle.

13:55.786 --> 13:59.626
I have slain none and I want to talk to a lawyer.

13:59.790 --> 14:04.300
You can pretend you do not hear me, so I say it out loud.

14:04.462 --> 14:08.932
It's enough like this. I want to talk to my lawyer, because I am arrested.

14:09.091 --> 14:12.931
Will you be blown now or something?

15:20.579 --> 15:24.789
The view is amazing. If you look to the right, you can see Catalina.

15:31.424 --> 15:36.004
It is extremely important that this is done tonight.

15:36.178 --> 15:38.138
Drinking alcohol is not covered by work.

15:38.305 --> 15:42.305
Anyway. If you work hard, there is always something to celebrate.

15:45.938 --> 15:50.278
You look beautiful. - Do not touch me, I do not fine.

15:50.443 --> 15:53.983
I apologize that I went too far.

15:55.072 --> 15:58.072
You're a great employee. - Thank you.

15:59.201 --> 16:02.671
In a great employee. - I'll drink to.

16:06.333 --> 16:12.333
Sometimes I am amazed at how beautiful and smart you are.

16:13.257 --> 16:15.297
Thank you.

16:15.468 --> 16:19.928
I respect you, Becky. Let's start.

16:29.690 --> 16:33.490
What is it? You type anymore.

16:36.864 --> 16:39.944
No idea. I feel strange.

16:40.117 --> 16:41.997
Weird? - No idea.

16:43.412 --> 16:46.992
I have not eaten yet. - The wine handsome you.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.716
No, there's something wrong with me.

16:54.882 --> 16:58.842
Maybe you warm. Do you look at her back.

16:59.011 --> 17:02.101
Do not touch me. - Did I do that?

17:02.264 --> 17:05.894
No go away. - How so? I live here.

17:08.311 --> 17:09.352
You are tired.

17:09.521 --> 17:14.781
I see you walking in the office. You know what it is about.

17:15.861 --> 17:18.701
You know what it is about.

17:45.558 --> 17:48.058
My sleeping beauty.

17:55.735 --> 17:59.525
What should I do with a topless maid?

17:59.697 --> 18:04.537
If I want a maid to fuck, I just fuck her.

18:04.702 --> 18:09.382
And you pay for it? A topless maid dusting off your cock.

18:12.877 --> 18:15.757
Just send me someone to clean my house.

18:15.921 --> 18:18.891
I have no topless maid. Everyone I know is topless.

18:19.050 --> 18:23.010
Rule one in a sweater that can clean.

18:23.179 --> 18:27.139
Bobby, it's your job to simplify my life.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.187
Just a moment.

18:36.734 --> 18:38.134
I'm coming.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.995
Look.

18:48.204 --> 18:50.494
Are you lost, little girl?

18:59.965 --> 19:02.385
Who are you? What do you want?

19:06.138 --> 19:09.638
What is this? - Do you recognize these girls?

19:09.809 --> 19:12.359
I do not get it.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.980
We know that makes you abuse your collaborators.

19:16.148 --> 19:19.028
I love women. They ask.

19:20.194 --> 19:21.904
You've been drugged and raped.

19:26.242 --> 19:28.462
Stop.

19:28.953 --> 19:31.533
You've probably heard before.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.706
And now you're going to suffer.

19:35.918 --> 19:41.548
What do you want? Money? I have plenty of money. That may have all of you.

19:45.344 --> 19:47.884
With money you get anywhere this time, Harold.

19:49.098 --> 19:53.558
Now you're going to admit that you drugged and these girls are raped.

19:55.938 --> 19:57.438
Let's just kill him.

19:57.606 --> 20:00.696
Well, I did it. It was fun.

20:04.155 --> 20:05.735
What is your password?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.500
69-69-69.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.127
How fun is this.

20:20.755 --> 20:23.795
Do you know her? - That's Becky.

20:23.966 --> 20:27.346
Cathy. Elizabeth.

20:27.511 --> 20:30.271
Sandy. Susie.

20:30.431 --> 20:34.101
© Oka, I have them all raped. They are employees of me.

20:34.268 --> 20:36.478
I gave them drink and drugs and abused them.

20:36.645 --> 20:39.725
Sorry. I did it.

20:41.067 --> 20:45.067
I need help. I am ill.

20:45.529 --> 20:47.829
I need help.

20:47.990 --> 20:51.910
Therefore, we have come to rid you of your bad habits.

20:52.495 --> 20:55.165
Do not hurt me.

20:55.331 --> 20:57.501
Thank you.

20:59.251 --> 21:00.651
You guys are crazy.

21:01.712 --> 21:06.792
If you say something about tonight ... - I say nothing. I have not seen you.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.637
Then I'll kill you.

21:16.936 --> 21:19.396
Send the pictures to the police.

21:37.957 --> 21:39.837
Jesus.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.380
Wanda Esparza, the witness.

21:48.884 --> 21:50.284
What does this mean?

21:53.764 --> 21:57.594
There is no case? - Dr. Cooray, please stay calm.

21:57.768 --> 22:01.978
Quiet? Should I stay calm?

22:04.108 --> 22:06.528
What did I do to you?

22:09.739 --> 22:13.749
Dirty crap. Goddamnit.

22:46.776 --> 22:49.856
Get out. Forward.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.399
In?

23:04.251 --> 23:07.511
I'll take it. - Good choice.

23:08.464 --> 23:14.714
This form filling, down payment and come back in ten days.

23:14.887 --> 23:18.347
Ten days? No that does not work.

23:19.392 --> 23:21.772
Sorry, but that's the law.

23:23.729 --> 23:25.129
And if I take away it?

23:37.660 --> 23:39.620
What do you want? - Vincent Trano.

23:39.787 --> 23:40.957
Who are you then?

23:41.122 --> 23:43.212
His nickname is Trigger. I need to talk to him.

23:44.291 --> 23:48.881
Do I look like a snitch? - Trigger or I pull my gun.

23:50.631 --> 23:54.391
You know how this thing works? - We can find out.

23:59.098 --> 24:01.228
You keep running.

24:01.851 --> 24:03.441
And run.

24:05.396 --> 24:08.816
You do not need your appendix. Only if you eat raw meat.

24:08.983 --> 24:10.901
They have beaten a golf ball from the moon.

24:11.026 --> 24:16.116
Which still haunts unless intercepted by aliens.

24:16.282 --> 24:20.372
It is an immoral society. Who are these people?

24:20.536 --> 24:24.496
Can me. I want both of you.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.300
How is it going? - There it is.

24:30.463 --> 24:34.213
I'm glad I declined to drink.

24:36.343 --> 24:38.263
you hold it for me?

24:39.722 --> 24:42.602
I'm only good for a half lap.

24:42.767 --> 24:47.477
Is he coming? - I? I never die.

24:47.646 --> 24:51.356
Go get Kleen. He's a good guy.

25:03.829 --> 25:06.879
It must out.

26:16.026 --> 26:20.736
Do you want to die or something? You've ruined my party.

26:28.039 --> 26:31.999
Stop those weird noises. That nowhere like.

26:34.170 --> 26:38.090
Did you get a little Scarface play here?

26:44.638 --> 26:46.598
You have the balls for it.

26:47.892 --> 26:49.732
Who are you?

26:49.894 --> 26:53.394
You killed my wife, asshole. My family.

27:00.529 --> 27:05.369
Right, yes. You belonged to the white woman and the little girl.

27:05.534 --> 27:07.784
I've afgeknald. - Fuck you.

27:09.622 --> 27:12.342
Not such a big mouth, you know.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.333
They suggested nothing.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.886
Fuck.

27:25.179 --> 27:30.189
Fall here a lot of killing, even though it is a nice neighborhood.

27:30.351 --> 27:35.611
Why was your wife with that nice little girl you in the barrio?

27:35.773 --> 27:38.393
Stand up.

27:38.567 --> 27:40.487
Stand up.

27:40.653 --> 27:44.573
You killed my wife, asshole. Now I kill you.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.290
I will kill you all.

27:46.450 --> 27:51.080
Stand still. Let drop. - Drop or we put you to.

27:53.749 --> 27:56.299
I'm unarmed.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.030
What is it? - I know this guy.

28:23.529 --> 28:27.869
You have one in his side and a hit in the shoulder.

28:28.034 --> 28:30.534
You're lucky to be alive.

28:32.371 --> 28:34.461
Illegal possession of arms.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.507
Attempted homicide.

28:39.795 --> 28:42.215
Here you will not get away with.

28:42.381 --> 28:46.721
You now have everything against you.

28:49.096 --> 28:51.936
You did not figure they need to go.

28:53.768 --> 28:56.518
I had to have no reason to.

29:02.985 --> 29:05.815
The prosecutor's your favor.

29:05.988 --> 29:10.198
He thinks you are overcome with grief was not sane.

29:10.368 --> 29:15.328
He wants to weaken the indictment. Attempted murder with a deadly weapon.

29:15.498 --> 29:19.088
Maar dan moet je wel schuld bekennen.

29:19.251 --> 29:22.801
Wat? Noem je dat gunstig gezind?

29:22.963 --> 29:25.503
Ik moet schuld bekennen?

29:25.674 --> 29:29.554
Dat is echt geen gerechtigheid.

29:29.720 --> 29:34.600
Het is overduidelijk dat je die gasten hebt aangevallen. Er zijn zat getuigen.

29:35.810 --> 29:39.940
Je gaat sowieso de bak in. De vraag is alleen: voor hoelang?

29:41.899 --> 29:45.319
Luister, als dit een rechtszaak wordt...

29:45.486 --> 29:48.486
dan duurt het zeker meer dan een jaar voor je moet voorkomen.

29:48.656 --> 29:51.576
And the punishment will extract a lot higher.

29:53.327 --> 29:55.167
Pak die deal.

30:30.156 --> 30:34.366
What have we here? - Fresh fish, boys.

30:41.542 --> 30:44.042
Hands off.

31:15.159 --> 31:16.659
Want a bite?

31:19.747 --> 31:22.627
Of my food. I offer you something. Do you want?

31:23.334 --> 31:25.454
No thanks. I have enough.

31:27.505 --> 31:31.925
I have something for you that you will find very tasty.

31:36.472 --> 31:38.982
Come and sit here.

31:42.019 --> 31:46.689
Thanks man. - You're welcome. Fuck that guy.

31:46.857 --> 31:49.197
Just sit in your time.

31:57.243 --> 32:00.743
What is going on there?

32:05.167 --> 32:05.997
Do you know?

32:06.168 --> 32:09.258
Hurry up with that bottle of Dom.

32:10.047 --> 32:11.637
What is this?

32:11.799 --> 32:14.719
Get your hands off me.

32:22.226 --> 32:24.436
I think you are wrong here.

32:43.914 --> 32:48.874
HÃ © if it's not too much trouble, then help me to throw out acorns.

32:49.045 --> 32:50.965
Well done.

32:52.757 --> 32:55.427
Rise. Come along.

32:55.593 --> 32:58.593
Get out flap turd. - Get lost.

32:59.555 --> 33:01.015
Fuck off.

33:03.434 --> 33:08.604
Thanks. What can I do for you? - It's okay.

33:25.790 --> 33:27.190
Do you still recognize me?

33:28.667 --> 33:32.047
It's time you will be sewn.

33:53.109 --> 33:55.409
Indeed, bitch.

33:55.569 --> 33:57.989
Cover the ass but.

34:00.074 --> 34:02.824
Get used to determine to go through your knees.

34:04.161 --> 34:06.711
Excuse me. - Screw you.

34:27.560 --> 34:31.270
Shit, guys. Do you want a month in solitary? Stay down.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.529
Guard. Piss off.

34:37.319 --> 34:38.869
Bunch of sissies.

34:41.907 --> 34:44.157
Come, I'll help you.

34:45.619 --> 34:49.129
Is everything okay? - Yes. I had she coped.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.420
Yes, I saw that.

34:50.583 --> 34:54.963
Maybe you should go learn how to survive here.

34:55.129 --> 34:57.629
Yes, I realize now.

34:57.798 --> 34:59.838
What's your name?

35:00.009 --> 35:01.679
Hank. - Nolan.

35:01.844 --> 35:04.424
Thanks. - No problem.

35:04.597 --> 35:06.767
What are you doing here? - I'm a lawyer.

35:06.932 --> 35:09.012
Attorney Hank.

35:09.185 --> 35:11.475
I do not even know why I'm here.

35:11.645 --> 35:14.815
Most criminals come up here.

35:14.982 --> 35:20.022
Because I'm the man who killed my family, tried to kill, I'm a criminal.

35:22.364 --> 35:24.574
Hold your horses.

35:26.660 --> 35:29.830
We'll get you there on top.

35:34.335 --> 35:37.125
You're pretty brave for a new one.

35:37.296 --> 35:41.006
But you want to die or so to go fight with Cam?

35:41.175 --> 35:45.345
Yes, I hear quite often ...

35:45.513 --> 35:48.133
but I did not want to be raped today.

35:48.307 --> 35:50.937
I've never had to fight so.

35:52.770 --> 35:58.950
Listen, the only language they speak is that of violence.

35:59.110 --> 36:02.990
It's kill or be slain.

36:03.155 --> 36:06.785
It's a different world here. If you fit in ...

36:06.951 --> 36:09.921
if you go there early or late.

36:10.079 --> 36:12.749
Well, I do not know yet.

36:12.915 --> 36:16.915
It's about survival. Do you want to come here ...

36:17.086 --> 36:21.506
then join a group for protection.

36:21.674 --> 36:23.754
The more, the safer.

36:23.926 --> 36:26.966
Or learn to fight like Hank fights.

36:28.764 --> 36:31.684
Maybe I will.

36:34.228 --> 36:36.858
Good luck with that.

36:37.022 --> 36:39.022
My name is Jackson.

36:39.191 --> 36:42.201
I'm not sure I want guards as a friend.

36:44.739 --> 36:51.369
So you do not want to be friends with the prisoners or the guards.

36:51.537 --> 36:58.537
Shit, man, I thought you meant it to come out of here in one piece.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.930
Sorry. My name is Nolan.

37:12.349 --> 37:16.189
It's me all too much.

37:16.353 --> 37:18.723
I do not know what to do.

37:18.898 --> 37:21.568
I get that.

37:21.734 --> 37:23.904
You were lucky that Hank intervened.

37:24.070 --> 37:27.160
Wie is the guest?

37:27.323 --> 37:29.863
Hank Carmac. He's working pro bono ...

37:30.034 --> 37:34.114
for prisoners who are unjustly in accordance with it.

37:34.288 --> 37:38.168
A self-made man, lives by a code. You do not often see lawyers.

37:38.334 --> 37:40.664
Waar heeft hij zo leren vechten?

37:40.836 --> 37:44.926
Geen idee. Men zegt dat hij 'n voormalig militair is, die advocaat is geworden.

37:45.091 --> 37:49.061
Hij haalde z'n bul op kosten van de staat en heeft nooit meer achterom gekeken.

37:51.263 --> 37:53.383
Een man met een missie.

37:53.557 --> 37:57.937
Geloof me, Hank is iemand die je erbij wilt hebben.

38:53.868 --> 38:55.368
Wil je er nog een, Hank?

38:55.536 --> 38:57.786
Je kent me, Chris. - Sorry dat we te laat zijn.

38:57.955 --> 39:01.335
I hate it when you picked up and the person is too late ...

39:01.500 --> 39:05.090
because I always wonder why phones are invented.

39:05.254 --> 39:06.714
You know her?

39:06.881 --> 39:11.261
I was held up by a shooting at China Garden.

39:14.221 --> 39:17.191
What do you have? - An interesting case.

39:17.349 --> 39:19.729
I met him in prison. Watch.

39:22.188 --> 39:24.818
Come on. you go you been working for this kind of characters?

39:24.982 --> 39:28.772
When it comes to justice, consider the case for business.

39:28.944 --> 39:33.284
His family was murdered. The only witness they have strangled.

39:33.449 --> 39:34.699
And so they went unpunished.

39:34.867 --> 39:39.917
What's he doing in jail? - What you would do. Survive.

39:40.373 --> 39:43.913
Police idiots are fixed very proud.

39:44.085 --> 39:48.375
All these suckers all screaming that they have had a bad deal.

39:48.547 --> 39:52.047
Right. But there was really a.

40:07.483 --> 40:10.523
Nolan, get up. I have good news.

40:10.694 --> 40:14.074
These come from Hank. He's going to do your thing.

40:25.751 --> 40:29.511
You must leave. This is no place for you.

40:29.672 --> 40:32.512
You're different from these animals.

40:32.675 --> 40:35.845
You can pick up a new life.

40:36.011 --> 40:39.311
Without your family that difficult, but ...

40:39.473 --> 40:44.933
you have that hatred and find freedom in your mind.

40:55.239 --> 40:56.639
The beautiful.

40:57.199 --> 40:59.409
Almost finished.

41:06.042 --> 41:10.172
TEN MONTHS LATER

41:12.173 --> 41:14.753
Did you almost out of your book?

41:14.925 --> 41:17.845
I told you you're best off with Hank.

41:18.012 --> 41:20.732
Yes, he's been very helpful.

41:20.890 --> 41:25.360
Without you and Hank would have been long dead.

41:27.938 --> 41:31.778
You're one of the few here who deserves to be free.

41:31.942 --> 41:38.402
Do whatever it takes to get justice and heal yourself.

41:38.574 --> 41:39.784
Thanks.

41:39.950 --> 41:42.460
See you at the hearing.

41:49.710 --> 41:50.920
What do you want, bitch?

41:51.087 --> 41:54.590
You seem to go quickly leave here because you're your lawyer bitch.

41:54.715 --> 41:59.135
Do as calm. - We need to finish something.

42:34.338 --> 42:38.638
Nolan, you hear me? Come here.

42:38.801 --> 42:41.601
Yes, I can hear you.

42:44.098 --> 42:46.768
When I took your case ...

42:46.934 --> 42:51.434
I thought you were principled and pursuing justice.

42:51.605 --> 42:55.895
I protected myself, Hank.

42:56.068 --> 43:02.118
I can not use it that you sit in isolation, just before I get free.

43:02.283 --> 43:06.073
This system is not working. You taught me.

43:06.245 --> 43:08.785
Nolan, you want to leave here?

43:08.956 --> 43:13.876
I told my students that they should have confidence in the law.

43:14.045 --> 43:17.925
I thought America was built on truth and justice.

43:18.090 --> 43:23.010
This country is turning into a bag of shit. And I'm in solitary.

43:23.179 --> 43:27.349
I'm in solitary. And for what?

43:27.516 --> 43:33.106
My family was murdered. Trigger should be here.

43:33.272 --> 43:36.942
Indeed. That should.

43:39.737 --> 43:43.827
But I put my time here, my money and my energy in.

43:43.991 --> 43:46.791
I could eat or fuck now, but I'm here with you.

43:48.245 --> 43:52.585
I ask for two months. Two months only. No more.

43:52.750 --> 43:54.590
Ik heb niets meer.

43:54.752 --> 43:59.932
Hou eens op met dat zelfmedelijden. Hier heb je nog minder, dat weet je best.

44:04.387 --> 44:07.557
Hoe is het met Cam?

44:07.723 --> 44:09.843
Cam?

44:10.017 --> 44:14.607
Cam interesseert me geen reet. Die vuile schoft...

44:14.772 --> 44:20.162
schoot een 17-jarige in haar gezicht nadat ze de kassa al had leeggehaald.

44:20.319 --> 44:22.764
Ik heb tegen je gezegd dat je je gedeisd moest houden...

44:22.905 --> 44:26.485
and you do not deal with the criminals here. Understood?

44:26.659 --> 44:29.209
Yes, understood.

44:31.622 --> 44:35.832
Good. And next time you kick him harder.

44:39.839 --> 44:43.679
You trust me, do you? - Sure I will.

44:43.843 --> 44:48.673
then give me a reason to trust you. We are almost there.

44:48.848 --> 44:54.808
I promise you I get free. But do not do anything crazy, okay ©?

44:55.271 --> 44:57.941
I will do.

44:58.107 --> 44:59.987
See you soon.

45:02.903 --> 45:04.443
And comply.

45:09.243 --> 45:13.823
Dr. Cooray, you have served your sentence of twelve months from two years.

45:13.998 --> 45:17.998
Do you think you are rehabilitated?

45:20.212 --> 45:23.542
Dr. Cooray? - I think so.

45:23.716 --> 45:27.756
He's a model prisoner, a hard worker ...

45:27.928 --> 45:31.138
and he always does what he is told.

45:31.307 --> 45:35.397
It says he ended up in some riots ...

45:35.561 --> 45:37.731
and has been in solitary confinement.

45:37.897 --> 45:41.697
That's right. But I went to all these riots ...

45:41.859 --> 45:46.319
and they were all out of self-preservation.

45:46.489 --> 45:50.829
Hank Carmac represent. - Yes sir.

45:50.993 --> 45:54.703
We know that you are committed to the rehabilitation of prisoners.

45:54.872 --> 46:00.082
Besides that you're his lawyer, is also personal to him.

46:00.252 --> 46:02.662
Absolutely, sir. He is a good man.

46:02.838 --> 46:06.138
He spent long enough to reflect on his single mistake ...

46:06.300 --> 46:10.020
which was caused by the tragic loss of his family.

46:10.805 --> 46:13.725
He accepts full responsibility for his actions.

46:13.891 --> 46:18.571
He expressed the wish to show class in college ...

46:18.729 --> 46:21.859
he, and that I think ...

46:22.024 --> 46:25.814
a positive contribution to make to the young minds of the country.

46:26.904 --> 46:29.614
Dr. Cooray...

46:29.782 --> 46:31.752
if you would be released ...

46:31.909 --> 46:36.119
bestaat dan de kans dat u weer vergelding gaat zoeken...

46:36.288 --> 46:39.288
voor de fouten die tegen u begaan zijn?

46:43.379 --> 46:48.009
Zeer zeker niet. Ik heb een grote fout gemaakt.

46:48.175 --> 46:50.925
Ik moet de wetshandhaving aan de professionals overlaten.

46:51.095 --> 46:56.095
Ik beloof dat ik geen dreiging zal vormen voor de mensen buiten deze muren.

46:56.267 --> 47:00.357
Wat ik gedaan heb, was fout. Dat besef ik maar al te goed.

47:00.521 --> 47:02.781
Ik heb er oprecht spijt van.

47:26.630 --> 47:30.010
Do you know the Soi Dog Tavern? - No.

47:30.176 --> 47:34.766
It's a nice bar. Every Wednesday I'll be there with my friends.

47:34.930 --> 47:37.810
We drink some.

47:37.975 --> 47:42.355
Come along sometime. - Thanks. I appreciate it a lot.

47:43.314 --> 47:46.854
I know you have your life back on track ...

47:47.026 --> 47:48.566
but the invitation stands.

50:00.868 --> 50:03.288
What the hell. What are you doing here?

50:03.454 --> 50:06.324
I did not think I'd see you so soon.

50:06.499 --> 50:09.126
I'll introduce you to my friends. This is Damian, my best friend.

50:09.251 --> 50:11.921
HÃ ©, how is it? - This is Amanda.

50:12.088 --> 50:14.588
I've heard a lot about you. - Nice to meet you.

50:14.757 --> 50:17.007
Kimberly, Chris, we can get some drinks?

50:17.176 --> 50:18.966
We get a lot in. - Really.

50:19.136 --> 50:21.726
Bryant and Plaza were working on your case, right?

50:21.889 --> 50:25.599
Do you know them? - Good cops. Both.

50:25.768 --> 50:27.938
You do not often see anymore. - Indeed.

50:28.104 --> 50:30.184
Amanda is one of them. She is also a cop.

50:30.356 --> 50:32.396
Really? - I'm trying.

50:32.566 --> 50:35.236
And these two were partners.

50:35.403 --> 50:39.613
Until I retired early because of excessive police violence.

50:39.782 --> 50:42.872
Yes, he split the wig of an unarmed drug dealer.

50:43.035 --> 50:45.165
That dealer was a cold killer.

50:45.329 --> 50:47.919
If I had not done it, he had killed someone.

50:48.082 --> 50:49.212
You've got a point.

50:49.375 --> 50:53.005
It walked here from the hand nicely. - Yeah, it looks like.

50:53.170 --> 50:56.220
Here they use yaba as MDMA use in Ciachella.

50:56.382 --> 51:00.102
That the guilty go unpunished, is more common than they want to say.

51:00.261 --> 51:03.601
Shape errors, debentures, you name it.

51:03.764 --> 51:09.684
They allow guests violent free because the prisons are overcrowded.

51:09.854 --> 51:11.514
This system is broken.

51:11.689 --> 51:15.109
Because they care more for the perpetrators than the victims.

51:15.276 --> 51:18.526
And then we do not always have the burden of proof in order.

51:18.696 --> 51:21.156
Even if they are clearly guilty.

51:21.323 --> 51:25.783
I watched your case. They have strangled your witness, huh?

51:25.953 --> 51:30.123
I'm still trying to figure out how the bastard get behind bars.

51:30.291 --> 51:34.551
What now bars? There are other ways to deal with those bastards.

51:36.172 --> 51:38.592
Really? - Yes.

51:41.135 --> 51:43.765
Play your own judge or something?

51:45.222 --> 51:49.642
How so? Are you curious? - I'll say.

51:56.901 --> 52:01.871
Every year, 300 murders committed in this city.

52:02.031 --> 52:05.251
Contrary to what they say, hard drugs are on the rise.

52:05.409 --> 52:07.999
Yaba new stuff is deadly.

52:08.162 --> 52:12.712
It's a mix of crystal meth and caffeine and as addictive as hell.

52:12.875 --> 52:16.085
My parents used to let their door lock.

52:16.253 --> 52:17.373
Die van mij ook.

52:17.546 --> 52:20.836
Nu zijn dat soort brave burgers bang om in het donker naar buiten te gaan.

52:21.008 --> 52:26.388
Als je je voordeur niet meer durft open te doen, leef je in angst.

52:26.555 --> 52:29.267
En als je niet bang bent, besef je niet hoe erg het is geworden.

52:29.392 --> 52:31.942
Elke dag komen er onschuldigen om.

52:32.103 --> 52:36.393
Het verkrachte meisje, wat jou en mij en mijn gezin is overkomen.

52:36.565 --> 52:40.485
Dit deugt niet. Mensen horen niet in angst te leven.

52:54.125 --> 52:57.415
What are we doing here? - View Street theater.

52:57.586 --> 52:59.926
What? - Watch me.

53:00.089 --> 53:02.719
Look at that dirty dealer now.

53:02.883 --> 53:05.053
Let's see if he can dealing with this.

53:08.597 --> 53:10.227
Wat are they doing?

53:14.729 --> 53:16.819
HÃ ©, you get out.

53:16.981 --> 53:18.741
What the hell?

53:20.818 --> 53:23.108
What is this? - Quiet.

53:37.668 --> 53:40.048
What do you want? My doekoe?

53:40.212 --> 53:43.122
Doekoe? What is doekoe?

53:43.299 --> 53:44.929
No idea.

53:45.092 --> 53:48.262
What's your name? - Jinx.

53:48.429 --> 53:51.769
A curse so, hopefully you're not. - What's your real name?

53:51.932 --> 53:55.102
Dick not so weak.

53:55.269 --> 53:57.729
What do you have on you?

53:58.606 --> 54:01.606
Quiet killer. - He asked what I had with me.

54:01.776 --> 54:04.906
It's fine this way. Give it to him.

54:08.783 --> 54:10.613
Enter.

54:10.785 --> 54:13.615
Ja, dit is dat spul met dat pistoollogo.

54:13.788 --> 54:17.668
Dat dachten we al. Waar heb je dit vandaan?

54:17.833 --> 54:21.503
Nergens vandaan. Ik leid hier de boel.

54:21.670 --> 54:26.640
Jij bent te stom om iets te leiden. Waar heb je het vandaan?

54:26.801 --> 54:31.471
Hij noemt zichzelf Omari. Hij kat auto's om op West North.

54:31.639 --> 54:36.979
Hij laat het gratis opsturen en vervoert het in zijn auto's.

54:37.144 --> 54:40.274
Dat was makkelijk. Bedankt.

54:53.828 --> 54:58.748
If I again aantref street if you mess with it are dealing ...

54:58.916 --> 55:03.046
then move your legs off.

55:15.766 --> 55:19.106
That's very beautiful. Thank you.

55:20.938 --> 55:22.338
I go for it right away.

55:31.449 --> 55:33.949
What do you think? - I do not trust him.

55:34.535 --> 55:37.535
Then we have to keep him sharp eye.

55:44.253 --> 55:47.333
HÃ ©, are you okay?

55:47.506 --> 55:50.676
I was joking when I asked if you were playing for their own right.

55:50.801 --> 55:52.811
You can not just afknallen people.

55:52.970 --> 55:55.890
Why not? Because the way you work so well?

55:56.057 --> 55:58.187
Drop dead.

56:01.062 --> 56:03.652
Listen up.

56:03.814 --> 56:05.354
I also have something to lose.

56:05.524 --> 56:09.564
Trust me, I've thought about this long.

56:09.737 --> 56:14.037
It's dead simple. Someone needs to give these criminals they deserved.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.580
Like the Oka © Trigger which is still on the loose?

56:16.744 --> 56:20.204
So he again someone could divert just like you or my family.

56:20.373 --> 56:23.453
That was different. - How?

56:24.168 --> 56:28.008
This dirty bastards play outside the rules.

56:28.172 --> 56:32.392
They have no respect for Amanda, you and me or anyone else.

56:33.594 --> 56:37.264
You would think Jinx was arrested without us?

56:37.431 --> 56:42.111
Would he have betrayed Omari? Wake up, Nolan.

56:43.437 --> 56:45.982
We do not warrant or due process required.

56:46.107 --> 56:51.527
We fix it and handing him over to the police. With a bow.

56:53.489 --> 56:57.749
He will do it again. - He's dead. Understood.

57:03.874 --> 57:06.244
You're crazy, but you know that already.

57:09.880 --> 57:13.550
Perhaps. Yeah, maybe I am it.

57:13.718 --> 57:16.768
But someone has to be.

57:25.563 --> 57:29.983
I need you probably do not remember that you have to be discreet.

57:35.364 --> 57:40.574
You were wondering. Now you know it. You have to do it again.

57:50.337 --> 57:52.467
Are you sure he is fit?

57:55.092 --> 57:59.262
He may not know it yet, but he's one of us.

59:23.305 --> 59:25.595
How is it going? - Sit down.

59:25.766 --> 59:29.306
Do you want coffee? Not really?

59:29.478 --> 59:35.148
You've probably heard that your attorney Hank Cormac ...

59:35.317 --> 59:37.447
again conducts a DNA-check.

59:37.611 --> 59:40.031
He sent a sample to Washington.

59:40.197 --> 59:44.287
They want to release an advanced research on it.

59:44.452 --> 59:46.832
What?

59:47.329 --> 59:51.919
Wanda sat on Esparza DNA traces which we have not seen.

59:52.460 --> 59:55.260
What? - Yes.

59:56.338 --> 59:59.468
Shit. - I should have told you.

59:59.633 --> 01:00:01.343
I'm looking for Trigger.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:06.890
I want to talk to him. I want a DNA sample from him.

01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:12.148
Think Trigger did it? - Wanda Esparza was strangled.

01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:15.733
They found nails on her clothes.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.780
If you ask me ... One © n and Ã © partement is two.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:47.270
Every 18 minutes someone dies in America overdose.

01:00:47.431 --> 01:00:50.691
In Ã © partement year more than 29,000 people lost their lives ...

01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:53.731
from an overdose of heroin or prescription painkillers ...

01:00:53.896 --> 01:00:58.356
including OxyContin, hydrocodone and the new street drug yaba.

01:00:58.526 --> 01:01:00.156
Thank you.

01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:08.457
How is it going?

01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:10.789
Something to eat? - No thanks.

01:01:10.955 --> 01:01:13.125
Drink? - No.

01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.834
What's on your mind?

01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:21.832
I do not understand why you have not told that lets you do a DNA check.

01:01:23.259 --> 01:01:26.509
I'm your lawyer. Thats my job.

01:01:26.679 --> 01:01:30.479
Information, facts. I need all the ammunition.

01:01:31.767 --> 01:01:34.937
I have come up with the right tool.

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:38.686
I know why you're here.

01:01:38.858 --> 01:01:40.448
I know it's difficult.

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:44.029
You try to obey the law, but it is not working.

01:01:44.196 --> 01:01:47.696
Whatever you decide, it's your decision.

01:01:51.287 --> 01:01:56.667
You know, I just want to see what my options are.

01:01:56.834 --> 01:01:58.234
Which can.

01:02:00.504 --> 01:02:04.254
I did not figure you wanted this. - I did not doubt it.

01:02:04.425 --> 01:02:06.925
There is something for you at?

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.520
I need to choose a gun, right? - Then that's your only choice.

01:02:15.936 --> 01:02:19.146
It is no fun there, so stay with us, you do not have a gun.

01:02:19.315 --> 01:02:22.065
Really. - I am watching you.

01:02:33.579 --> 01:02:35.129
Let drop.

01:02:45.216 --> 01:02:48.306
Are you Omari?

01:02:48.469 --> 01:02:52.519
Talking is fine, but you do not need to shoot to pieces my workplace.

01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:55.851
Where's the stuff? - What?

01:02:56.018 --> 01:02:58.818
The yaba, stupid dick. Where is it?

01:03:01.148 --> 01:03:06.488
I do not know about you, but I run a legitimate business here.

01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:12.036
You think I'm aiming a gun at me for the first time?

01:03:12.201 --> 01:03:17.381
I recognize you really kind of criminals do. Shoot me.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.010
Shut up and put your hand on the table.

01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:24.469
I'm not fooling. Put it on the table.

01:03:28.008 --> 01:03:32.268
Break his hand. You heard me.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.230
Hit him.

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:37.440
Quiet, motherfucker. Backwards.

01:03:37.601 --> 01:03:39.771
You do not die.

01:03:42.398 --> 01:03:44.528
Did that hurt? Put him back on.

01:03:50.239 --> 01:03:52.659
Do it again, but louder.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.830
What are you waiting for? Do it.

01:04:06.088 --> 01:04:08.548
Come on. You know it already.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.520
That's why you're here, right? Jinx.

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:18.519
He said that a couple gangsters forced him to speak.

01:04:18.684 --> 01:04:21.604
Grab it and fuck off.

01:04:22.563 --> 01:04:26.603
Do you think we are stupid? You insult us.

01:04:26.776 --> 01:04:30.366
Ik weet iets beters. Sla hem op z'n smoel. Goed hard.

01:04:37.495 --> 01:04:40.075
Ik gebruik de auto's.

01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:43.087
Wielkasten, voeringen.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:46.300
Ik stop het in elk hoekje en gaatje.

01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:52.006
Dat wilden we graag horen.

01:05:00.142 --> 01:05:01.642
Hebbes.

01:05:03.145 --> 01:05:04.895
Dit is het.

01:05:09.985 --> 01:05:14.235
Plaza, hebbes. Stuur de troepen maar. - Doe ik.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.050
Kut-infiltranten.

01:05:42.935 --> 01:05:48.815
Dammit, professor, you surged violently on that hand. I think I saw bones.

01:05:48.983 --> 01:05:52.443
How does it feel not to be powerless? - Very well.

01:05:52.611 --> 01:05:55.121
I'll say.

01:06:09.628 --> 01:06:11.028
What are you doing?

01:06:12.214 --> 01:06:15.094
We do not like the stuff. Drugs we burn.

01:06:15.259 --> 01:06:17.139
Money we put back into the community.

01:06:17.303 --> 01:06:19.673
Ja, net als Robin Hood.

01:06:19.847 --> 01:06:22.097
There he is again.

01:06:22.224 --> 01:06:26.354
He does have feeling. It takes a while before you're through.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:31.820
Police have arrested Omari. - Without us, that was not successful.

01:06:31.984 --> 01:06:35.154
That's why we do it outside of the rules.

01:06:50.086 --> 01:06:52.086
Nice, huh?

01:06:58.427 --> 01:07:01.057
But not as nice as it was.

01:07:03.474 --> 01:07:07.934
How did you get mixed up in this? - How do you mean?

01:07:08.104 --> 01:07:11.934
What you're doing.

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:20.290
I had such a nice family like yours.

01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:23.659
A beautiful woman. Watch.

01:07:27.373 --> 01:07:31.703
I carry with me always. - She sure is pretty.

01:07:31.877 --> 01:07:35.587
An Aryan convicted, Krieger called, packed everything.

01:07:35.756 --> 01:07:39.256
I had won a case which gave him life.

01:07:41.387 --> 01:07:45.057
He sent his boys to my house. I was not there.

01:07:46.642 --> 01:07:49.102
My wife was at home.

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:52.280
So she grabbed her.

01:07:57.903 --> 01:08:02.863
They raped and abused her so much ...

01:08:03.034 --> 01:08:07.824
she was in a coma for six months. When she came to, she was leaving me.

01:08:07.997 --> 01:08:10.707
She blamed me for everything.

01:08:12.084 --> 01:08:15.754
Two years later she hung in her wardrobe.

01:08:17.465 --> 01:08:20.755
Suicide. - Jesus.

01:08:22.094 --> 01:08:24.264
These racists have killed her anyway.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.939
It only took two years before she died.

01:08:27.099 --> 01:08:29.349
Hank, how awful.

01:08:29.518 --> 01:08:33.188
They still walk around freely. They never found them.

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:41.944
But you're free. - Indeed.

01:08:42.113 --> 01:08:46.283
You're a good man. - You too.

01:08:55.836 --> 01:08:58.166
Guess. - What?

01:08:58.339 --> 01:09:01.049
One of my informers, a street whore ...

01:09:01.216 --> 01:09:04.136
Triggers DNA has a joint they smoked together.

01:09:04.303 --> 01:09:08.973
The DNA corresponding to the track on Wanda's body.

01:09:10.017 --> 01:09:14.517
Our lab has been confirmed? - Yes. And we have a warrant.

01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:17.398
We have that bastard.

01:09:17.566 --> 01:09:20.406
Well done Plaza. - Thank you, detective.

01:09:28.577 --> 01:09:33.457
Nolan, Detective Bryant. I can tell you this is not actually ...

01:09:33.624 --> 01:09:38.163
but we have an arrest warrant for Vincent Trano or Trigger.

01:09:42.508 --> 01:09:44.678
Hey guys.

01:09:46.011 --> 01:09:48.640
Detective.

01:09:48.805 --> 01:09:51.975
How are you? - What are you doing here?

01:09:52.143 --> 01:09:55.723
Do you have him? - We are working on it.

01:09:55.896 --> 01:10:01.606
What does that mean? - He was not home.

01:10:02.486 --> 01:10:06.446
His mother has not seen him for months.

01:10:06.615 --> 01:10:11.075
And you believe her? - Between these two is no wasted love.

01:10:11.245 --> 01:10:14.075
He is not a model son.

01:10:14.248 --> 01:10:17.668
He's probably hiding with a friend. - Which can.

01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:23.545
But we can not possibly go through all doors. He could be anywhere.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.640
This time we get him. Do not worry.

01:10:26.802 --> 01:10:31.472
No worries? You say that really?

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.150
Whenever we got him, he manages to escape.

01:10:35.311 --> 01:10:39.281
Let us do our job. - Yes, do that.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.860
This was my last hope. And you can not even find him.

01:10:44.028 --> 01:10:47.658
We have his DNA. It will not take much longer.

01:10:47.823 --> 01:10:52.203
And then he gets out by a technicality.

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:56.540
Let justice do its work.

01:10:56.707 --> 01:10:59.707
You're exhausted. Go home to rest.

01:10:59.877 --> 01:11:05.177
I'll let you know if I have more have come to know, right?

01:11:05.341 --> 01:11:10.601
Good. But please find him.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:19.020
Ponds, Covington, okay?

01:11:21.565 --> 01:11:24.815
Nolan, what are you doing here?

01:11:24.985 --> 01:11:28.695
Bryant called me. They have a warrant for Trigger.

01:11:28.864 --> 01:11:31.904
And? - I was just checking.

01:11:32.076 --> 01:11:34.576
Did they find him? - No.

01:11:34.745 --> 01:11:39.835
And there you are still watching. Listen ...

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.253
your presence here I am uncomfortable.

01:11:42.378 --> 01:11:43.801
Whether you do it our way ...

01:11:43.963 --> 01:11:46.883
if you focus on our crappy law enforcement.

01:11:47.049 --> 01:11:50.099
But both ways food can not.

01:11:50.261 --> 01:11:52.931
I think you're still a cop.

01:11:53.097 --> 01:11:56.517
I'm not a cop. I'm a scout.

01:11:58.185 --> 01:12:00.725
Without information we have nothing.

01:12:02.064 --> 01:12:04.944
Detective Bryant is a good cop.

01:12:05.109 --> 01:12:08.279
But he's an idealist. I'm a realist.

01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:10.661
Okay, I get it.

01:12:10.823 --> 01:12:14.993
If they catch Trigger, it is for the murder of a snitch.

01:12:15.161 --> 01:12:17.921
Not for what he did to your wife and daughter.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.550
Ask yourself but even if that is justice?

01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:33.386
First he rost dealer together and then he sits chatting with the police.

01:12:33.554 --> 01:12:36.684
For such a smart guy, he seems pretty confused.

01:12:36.849 --> 01:12:41.649
You're kidding. How do you know for sure that it does not overflow?

01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:44.472
I keep saying that he is one of us.

01:12:44.648 --> 01:12:48.818
Look, Hank, I do not have much confidence in him as you ...

01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:50.986
but I trust your judgment.

01:12:51.155 --> 01:12:57.075
Shit, I think he is too preoccupied with that trigger, if I'm honest.

01:12:57.244 --> 01:13:01.704
That explains a lot, but that does not solve it.

01:13:01.874 --> 01:13:05.664
The police have combed the entire area but found nothing.

01:13:05.836 --> 01:13:07.876
He's probably already in Mexico.

01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:12.467
Not really. This is his home. He's not really gone.

01:13:13.636 --> 01:13:18.096
How can you be so sure? - Would you do that?

01:13:21.644 --> 01:13:25.774
Amanda, you have a gun, a badge and a passport.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.530
Where that dick might be, find him.

01:13:29.693 --> 01:13:31.903
Your way.

01:13:33.531 --> 01:13:35.581
Make it happen.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.720
You yesterday went to the police.

01:13:55.886 --> 01:13:58.226
I explained Amanda.

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:01.270
Yes, we know.

01:14:03.477 --> 01:14:08.737
They will not find him, huh? - Not in the legitimate way.

01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:13.529
Of course you can wait for a system that fails structurally ...

01:14:13.696 --> 01:14:17.446
or you can do something with.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.710
I participate. - It's about time. Getting Started, Nolan.

01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:42.771
I want to see you and I raise.

01:14:44.143 --> 01:14:45.183
How much is that?

01:14:45.352 --> 01:14:48.682
Do you want a white and blue settle?

01:14:48.856 --> 01:14:52.526
It's my turn. - Tell that to her.

01:14:52.693 --> 01:14:55.943
That can not do. Never mind, I'm all-in.

01:15:00.826 --> 01:15:03.786
So much I did not. - Did you study?

01:15:05.247 --> 01:15:09.417
Yes, in the Folsom State Prison. I've attended a few classes.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.970
you go all-in?

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:15.760
Who put my gun on the pot?

01:15:15.925 --> 01:15:18.555
Not me. - Who's the weed?

01:15:20.096 --> 01:15:22.516
One took it from those hotties.

01:15:22.681 --> 01:15:26.561
You never take responsibility for something, huh?

01:15:26.727 --> 01:15:30.187
I'm not a snitch. - OKA ©.

01:15:36.862 --> 01:15:41.322
HÃ ©, Nolan. This is for you. Loaded with the safety catch on it.

01:15:41.951 --> 01:15:44.961
Tonight you can play with the big boys.

01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:48.751
Be careful where you walk and shoot your cock out off.

01:15:58.175 --> 01:16:01.635
Why are we here, Hank? - This is why.

01:16:01.804 --> 01:16:05.224
What the hell? - You were right.

01:16:05.391 --> 01:16:08.311
He bullshit, so he is free.

01:16:08.477 --> 01:16:12.937
Fortunately Bryant Omari has picked up. He told what was Jinx.

01:16:13.107 --> 01:16:14.817
Unreliable dogs.

01:16:14.984 --> 01:16:18.484
So Jinx knows more than he has conned us.

01:16:18.654 --> 01:16:21.234
Only he has not told us yet.

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.540
But we are, anyway, eventually.

01:16:25.703 --> 01:16:27.823
You bet he's going to talk.

01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:32.087
Is that right? Do you know where Trigger?

01:16:34.545 --> 01:16:36.125
Go ahead.

01:16:36.297 --> 01:16:40.637
I tell you nothing. - Is that right?

01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:44.849
You talked to be released and Omari ratted you.

01:16:45.014 --> 01:16:46.974
You have no honor.

01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:51.571
Yes, I have some white politicians bijgelapt who went to prostitutes.

01:16:51.729 --> 01:16:55.109
But Trigger makes me wonder. He's the boss.

01:16:57.568 --> 01:17:01.658
It is time for you to talk. You're going to tell me where he is ...

01:17:01.822 --> 01:17:05.032
otherwise I break all your bones. Tell.

01:17:06.077 --> 01:17:08.747
Well, I'll say.

01:17:08.913 --> 01:17:14.913
But if you catch him, do me a favor. Finish him, then everyone is happy.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:42.950
There are triggers SafeHouse.

01:17:43.114 --> 01:17:46.574
He is not so safe anymore.

01:17:46.742 --> 01:17:50.282
He's playing poker there with some gear and their chicks.

01:17:50.454 --> 01:17:55.044
He has a former commando and bodyguard hired because he expected action.

01:17:58.254 --> 01:18:00.374
You know what to do.

01:18:07.722 --> 01:18:11.942
I have a possible suspect location.

01:18:35.249 --> 01:18:37.209
Bryan...

01:18:41.881 --> 01:18:43.431
What a great guest.

01:18:55.686 --> 01:18:59.476
It is shot at the track in the center.

01:19:05.613 --> 01:19:08.113
You cheat. - How?

01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:10.742
You've given yourself two aces.

01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:15.330
This can be solved by Ã © partement way. You go for a ride ...

01:19:15.498 --> 01:19:19.248
pipes each other and drive the mountain.

01:19:27.218 --> 01:19:29.388
Trigger, stand up. Now.

01:19:29.553 --> 01:19:31.173
Get up, goddammit.

01:19:31.847 --> 01:19:33.247
Rise.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.730
Stand still.

01:19:35.893 --> 01:19:38.513
Do not let him murder me. - Shut up, bitch.

01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:47.813
Nice to see you again.

01:19:55.204 --> 01:19:57.374
We got you, dick.

01:19:57.998 --> 01:19:59.168
Go away.

01:19:59.333 --> 01:20:01.252
Verschuil you behind a wife? Cowardly dog.

01:20:01.377 --> 01:20:04.127
Get the typhoid. Get away from me.

01:20:06.966 --> 01:20:09.386
Is everything okay?

01:20:34.535 --> 01:20:36.455
Down there.

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:40.460
Come on, doc, finish him.

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:51.180
And now?

01:21:01.062 --> 01:21:03.322
He killed your family.

01:21:04.774 --> 01:21:07.024
What have I done to you? - Do it.

01:21:18.662 --> 01:21:21.122
I do not even know who you are, gay people.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:22.960
Do not you know who I am?

01:21:27.922 --> 01:21:30.802
Are you back? - Yes.

01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:34.136
We have not got all night. Shoot him.

01:21:34.303 --> 01:21:36.213
Forward.

01:21:45.731 --> 01:21:48.491
You're better than this. You're fucking soldier.

01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:51.621
The only reason I let you stumble out of here.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.000
I can not do it. - I knew it.

01:22:01.163 --> 01:22:02.993
He escapes this time.

01:22:03.165 --> 01:22:07.915
I'm not a snitch. I keep my mouth though.

01:22:08.087 --> 01:22:10.717
If you do not, I will. Shoot me.

01:22:10.881 --> 01:22:13.641
By that I do not get my family. - Indeed.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.400
I'm the boss in this city. About everything.

01:22:24.562 --> 01:22:27.732
That is why you are still alive. What do you want? I did drugs ...

01:22:27.898 --> 01:22:28.988
Shut up.

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:31.736
Bitches. Or do you want to know what cops are corrupt?

01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:34.031
Shoot me, motherfucker.

01:22:58.304 --> 01:23:01.014
It must be one of those buildings.

01:23:20.159 --> 01:23:21.959
Are you OK?

01:23:22.119 --> 01:23:25.579
Everything is in order. Kill the bastard.

01:23:30.461 --> 01:23:33.301
Damian, are you okay?

01:23:38.844 --> 01:23:42.224
Plaza, Damian touched. Send an ambulance to Fifth and Ozone.

01:23:44.266 --> 01:23:46.856
Down there it is.

01:23:48.396 --> 01:23:49.796
Fifth en Ozone.

01:24:07.998 --> 01:24:09.398
Are you OK?

01:24:26.475 --> 01:24:28.055
You have slain him.

01:24:29.854 --> 01:24:31.644
Thanks.

01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:35.273
You saved my life.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.540
Did you see what happened? - Yes, I've seen everything.

01:24:44.702 --> 01:24:46.922
It was clear self-defense.

01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:50.243
Will you take care of this? I go to Damian. - Just go.

01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:51.876
I'm coming with you.

01:24:53.335 --> 01:24:55.965
Is everything okay? - Yes fine.
