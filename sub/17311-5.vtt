00:12.650 --> 00:15.920
Tonight, we try to grow our own petrol.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.450
Wah!

00:17.450 --> 00:21.070
I drive the new Lamborghini quite badly.

00:21.070 --> 00:26.350
And the Cool Wall muse Kristin Scott Thomas is in our reasonably priced car.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.520
Hello, hello and welcome.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.500
Thank you, thank you, now.

00:44.270 --> 00:45.550
Now, back in the summer,

00:45.551 --> 00:49.850
we were literally inundated with a letter from a railway company

00:49.850 --> 00:52.000
who asked us to do a feature on the show

00:52.001 --> 00:54.000
about the dangerous of level crossings.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.705
Yeah. Now even though we don't make

00:55.706 --> 00:57.820
Health and Safety public information films,

00:57.820 --> 01:01.770
I though I could pull it off until he bursted into the office

01:01.770 --> 01:04.069
and announced that he wanted to do it.

01:04.069 --> 01:07.370
Yes, I will practise more serious voice and this is what I came up with.

01:09.420 --> 01:13.120
It's a commonly held believe that younger drivers are the ones

01:13.121 --> 01:15.420
who cause more Britain's car accidents.

01:15.420 --> 01:19.500
terring about on drugs with their hats on back to front.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.150
But the truth is that

01:22.150 --> 01:25.065
eldly people are 3 times more likely

01:25.066 --> 01:27.947
to have a crash than their grandchildren.

01:29.450 --> 01:30.720
Think about it.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.300
When was the last time you heard of a young person

01:33.301 --> 01:36.520
driving the wrong way down a motorway.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.200
Never.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.900
It's always an old person in their 80s

01:44.450 --> 01:49.850
And how often do you heard about a teenager plying their car into the sea.

01:49.850 --> 01:51.650
Again, never.

01:51.650 --> 01:54.450
It's always an old lady in a Fiesta.

01:55.220 --> 01:57.020
Chaos of OAP trip on M25 at 8mph

01:57.020 --> 01:58.970
Pensioner drivers into 7 cars

02:00.199 --> 02:02.924
But now it seems Briton's old people have found

02:02.924 --> 02:06.000
a new way to get their kicks.

02:13.550 --> 02:18.250
Terrifyingly, they are jumping the lights of level crossings.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.600
Look at this idiot caught on CCTV

02:26.600 --> 02:29.000
larking about in his Reliant Robin.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.270
He was lucky not to kill someone.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.450
We examine the footage more carefully,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.370
we see the really worrying thing.

02:36.370 --> 02:40.820
He wasn't even wearing a high visibility jacket.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.557
The trouble is that people have seen their grandparents

02:43.557 --> 02:45.370
driving through the redlights

02:45.370 --> 02:47.400
with no safety clothing at all,

02:47.400 --> 02:50.270
and think it's OK for them to do it as well.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.650
The figures make for a poorly reading.

02:54.650 --> 02:57.350
There are 1600 level crossings in Britain

02:57.350 --> 02:59.900
and according to British rail or whatever they're called these days,

02:59.900 --> 03:02.570
many people are injured on them very year.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.970
You might think it's fun to jump the red lights.

03:08.970 --> 03:12.270
You might think it will save you a few minutes.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.750
You might think it's OK because your granddads alway doing it

03:16.750 --> 03:18.500
or because you've got a Renault Espace

03:18.500 --> 03:22.320
which has a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.000
But it's not alright.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.970
Coz I shall now prove with a gratuity shot of a train

03:27.970 --> 03:31.450
smashing into Espace at very high speed.

03:31.450 --> 03:34.750
(radio)

03:40.200 --> 03:41.814
Warning, Do not trespass on the Railway. Penalty 1000 pounds.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.550
That's quick.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.850
You drove like that on a public road,

04:08.850 --> 04:11.220
you deserve to be called a maniac.

04:19.170 --> 04:20.920
That's tossed!

04:25.070 --> 04:26.350
That's bad!

04:45.620 --> 04:47.820
I'd quite like to see that again,

04:47.820 --> 04:49.600
in slow motion.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.170
And even slower.

05:07.720 --> 05:13.720
So that is how far the train went from what, 70, 80 miles an hour.

05:16.770 --> 05:19.550
The message then is clear.

05:20.270 --> 05:23.870
Unless you want that to happen to you,

05:25.620 --> 05:29.100
Alway wear this.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.300
Thank you.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.570
Think! Always wear a high visibility jacket.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.170
- See? idiot.
- What?

05:42.170 --> 05:48.170
Well, just what in the name of god was that?

05:48.170 --> 05:49.500
All they wanted you to do was to say

05:49.500 --> 05:52.120
"Don't run the red lights at level crossings."

05:52.120 --> 05:53.550
Yes, that.

05:53.550 --> 05:57.350
And what sort of imbecile watches a train crashing into a car

05:57.350 --> 05:59.350
and then jumps up and down shouting "That's tossed"

05:59.350 --> 06:03.320
Unlike I've decided making public information films

06:03.320 --> 06:04.920
I'm gonna do on speeding.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.900
No, really I'm.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.800
Honestly, I'm gonna set you and May on fire, right?

06:08.800 --> 06:11.820
May gets on the motorcycle goes really fast to see if he can put himself out,

06:11.820 --> 06:12.870
you stand still

06:12.870 --> 06:14.700
Just no. This is a bad idea, alright?

06:14.700 --> 06:17.300
Then I've got a skyscraper... Anyway, listen, I'll flesh it out later,

06:17.300 --> 06:19.670
coz now we gotta do the news.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.350
Yes, and we begin with the Maserati coupe,

06:22.350 --> 06:24.550
which is a car we've never been entirely sure about.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.400
Mainly because we don't think it's that good looking.

06:27.401 --> 06:29.101
However, there is a new one.

06:29.102 --> 06:31.402
It's called the new Maserati Granturismo

06:31.500 --> 06:34.670
I have a picture of it and it's a thing of beauty, isn't it?

06:34.670 --> 06:36.400
- Oh, yeah.
- Gorgeous.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.800
Hey, you can tell Kristin Scott Thomas

06:37.800 --> 06:39.550
is coming into the studio as a guest today.

06:39.550 --> 06:42.200
- How?
- He is wearing a suit. Look at him.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.450
It's... All my jeans are in the wash.

06:45.450 --> 06:46.170
Oh, really!

06:46.170 --> 06:49.350
All of a sudden, 92 programs we've done, you've been in jeans.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.420
Now today when Kristin's coming in,

06:51.420 --> 06:52.970
They're all mucky!

06:53.520 --> 06:55.050
I thought he was going for a job interview.

06:55.050 --> 06:58.820
He's got that. Exactly the way. It's exactly how he looks.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.170
This Maserati...

07:00.170 --> 07:02.420
- He's had his hair cut as well.
- Yes, haha!

07:02.420 --> 07:06.050
- He has! You have!
- I've had my hair cut because it was too long.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.700
- Last week...
- Were you combing it frantically before...

07:08.700 --> 07:10.050
Shut up! What did you say?

07:10.050 --> 07:11.670
I was going to say last week I have mine cut

07:11.671 --> 07:15.070
and you said having your hair cut on a studio day was GAY!

07:17.100 --> 07:20.600
- Did you
- I said you should spend more than 4 pounds on a hair cut, James.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.120
That's what I actually said.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.200
- So why didn't you?
- Will you shut up!

07:25.200 --> 07:30.550
- Anyway, the M..
- This Maserati, what it got under the bonnet is a 4.2 V8

07:30.550 --> 07:31.350
Same as the old one.

07:31.350 --> 07:35.850
Yep. 405 bhp, automatic gearbox, it's gonna be 73,000 pounds.

07:35.850 --> 07:36.900
I'm besotted with it.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.770
Right. I think it looks absolutely stunning.

07:38.770 --> 07:42.100
I mean if you're thinking of buying an Aston DB9 or a V8,

07:42.100 --> 07:43.970
now, that's the alternative.

07:43.970 --> 07:46.770
It's a good looking thing but there's an alternative to the alternative

07:46.770 --> 07:48.570
It's got a sister car. Let's have a look at that.

07:48.570 --> 07:49.870
The Alfa Romeo 8C

07:49.870 --> 07:52.620
Come on, say it. You've been practising all week. Here we go.

07:52.620 --> 07:53.750
Competizione.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.670
Yeah! Bravo.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.470
That's a legal word.

08:00.470 --> 08:03.270
Sounds like I'm a /. But it's related.

08:03.270 --> 08:06.500
It's got a 4.7L V8, so the engine is slightly bigger.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.657
It's related underneath,

08:07.657 --> 08:10.470
but it's got this beautiful carbon fibre body over the top.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.200
The only thing is, as an alternative,

08:12.200 --> 08:15.650
there's a problem. They're only making 500 and they're all sold.

08:15.650 --> 08:17.670
But I think that's better looking actually.

08:17.670 --> 08:19.450
- Nah.
- No. Maserati is better.

08:19.450 --> 08:21.350
Put Maserati back up. There you are. It's better.

08:21.350 --> 08:22.820
- I think the Alfa is better looking.
- No, I'd have that.

08:22.820 --> 08:25.600
Oh why don't you ask Kristin which she prefers?

08:26.670 --> 08:30.220
I will. It will be nice to talk to somebody intelligent.

08:30.670 --> 08:35.549
Now, news this week, the most unsensible car I've ever heard of .

08:35.549 --> 08:37.220
Volkswagen Passat. Here it is.

08:37.220 --> 08:40.570
It's all 36 got v6 engine four wheel drive body hugging

08:40.570 --> 08:43.820
sports seats, low profile tyres, whole nine yards

08:43.820 --> 08:44.720
the thing is though

08:44.720 --> 08:46.400
If you want a sport saloon,

08:46.400 --> 08:50.920
the last 2 words that pop into you head after say Mister and Kipling

08:50.920 --> 08:53.120
are Volkswagon and Passat.

08:53.120 --> 08:53.850
It just doesn't make any sense.

08:53.850 --> 08:56.141
No, it's like saying would you like some more fruit cake, vicar?

08:56.141 --> 08:57.570
It's got cocaine in it.

08:59.350 --> 09:00.500
Ludicrous.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.670
Now, hey. On the way down here this morning,

09:03.670 --> 09:05.620
I saw something so amazing that

09:05.620 --> 09:08.220
I took a photograph of it. Here it is.

09:09.150 --> 09:10.920
I wanna stress I wasn't driving.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.750
Er, obviously I was taking pictures, I was in the...

09:13.750 --> 09:15.700
You were sitting on the drivers lap, brother, look at it.

09:15.700 --> 09:20.170
I was doing that. The thing is though, it's a Peugeot 1007.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.920
- They sold one!
- Somebody's bought one!

09:22.920 --> 09:24.270
Somebody went into a shop and said

09:24.271 --> 09:27.270
"I'd like a small car but can you make it really really heavy

09:27.270 --> 09:29.950
with really complicated doors. And I'd like to pay money for that."

09:29.950 --> 09:33.050
Yes. I want to go for 0-60 in 18 sec.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.900
That's how slow it is.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.970
Why are you in a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

09:36.970 --> 09:40.170
The day that Kristin Scott Thomas is in ...

09:40.170 --> 09:43.920
you suddenly decide that you need to test a Phantom again.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.950
Parked it just out side, have you by any chance?

09:45.950 --> 09:46.870
It's out there, yeah.

09:46.870 --> 09:47.750
- Is it?
- Yeah.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.320
- where can be seen?
- Yeah.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.550
I was just thought it would...

09:51.550 --> 09:53.820
Do you seriously think she is gonna be impressed

09:53.821 --> 09:57.120
by some yellow-tooth fat old man with

09:57.120 --> 10:01.450
toothful hair getting out of somebody else's Rolls-Royce.

10:01.450 --> 10:04.150
At least he's had his pubes cut.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.750
It's pathetic.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.850
We have the results of a Top Gear survey. This is where you tell us

10:09.850 --> 10:11.600
what it's like to own various cars.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.970
56,000 of you responded. I'm very grateful to you all.

10:14.970 --> 10:19.400
And I'm delighted to say that the car that... the most satisfying car that you can own

10:19.400 --> 10:23.250
according to the people who actually own it, I just test drived it is

10:23.250 --> 10:24.550
Car of champion for years

10:24.550 --> 10:26.900
the Honda S2000 again.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.070
No no no.

10:28.070 --> 10:30.070
And what do you say is the best small sports car?

10:30.070 --> 10:31.270
BMW Z4

10:31.270 --> 10:32.700
Which came 62nd.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.650
And you, Porsche Boxster as I recall. You said that's better than a Honda.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.070
That was 43rd.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.520
- Oh, dear.
- Speaking of which,

10:39.520 --> 10:42.150
How are the electrical windows in your Porsche Boxster?

10:42.150 --> 10:43.320
- Fine.
- Still broken?

10:43.320 --> 10:44.550
No, they work.

10:44.550 --> 10:46.670
I'm not always in it when they work.

10:46.670 --> 10:50.170
He's very often in bed when they work.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.820
Well, maybe. But my other car

10:51.820 --> 10:54.420
the Fiat Panda, I think I'm right in saying

10:54.420 --> 10:56.750
What's funny about this?

10:56.750 --> 10:59.480
No, you couldn't be more right. He does have a Fiat Panda.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.300
And you're right, James.

11:00.300 --> 11:03.470
It was in the top 10, with all the Skodas.

11:03.470 --> 11:06.000
What people say here is that it was better

11:06.000 --> 11:07.850
than they thought it was going to be.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.650
It's like which I was buying a ton of manure,

11:09.650 --> 11:12.150
it doesn't smell that bad, actually.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.450
To be honest, I'm quite surprised by it.

11:14.450 --> 11:16.950
Coz it's fun to drive, it's well made,

11:16.950 --> 11:18.650
it's economical, it looks good.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.520
It says all of that in the magazine bumf but it also says

11:21.520 --> 11:24.650
that people claimed it was predictably slow

11:24.650 --> 11:27.320
- Which it is...
- It is, why don't you tell the ladies and gentlemen

11:27.320 --> 11:29.620
what happened when we all met up the other day to go on a shoot,

11:29.621 --> 11:31.620
met at the hotel we had to go to a location,

11:31.620 --> 11:32.650
you turned up in your panda.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.450
I had an Aston that day and you had a 911.

11:35.450 --> 11:38.920
Well, alright. But in fairness, I had only picked it up that morning

11:38.920 --> 11:40.820
and it only had 8 miles on the clock.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.070
and I didn't know what all the knobes and things did yet.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.520
What do you mean knobes- there's only two knobes in it,

11:44.520 --> 11:46.300
well three if you count the one who bought it.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.070
It's a simple car.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.470
Anyway, I said "look, I haven't got a map. Can I just follow you?"

11:57.470 --> 11:59.570
And they said "Yes, yes. Of course you can. Come on off we go."

11:59.570 --> 12:01.950
And they went off at 120 miles an hour.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.270
You should have bought a faster car then you could've kept up.

12:05.270 --> 12:08.120
You used it as an excuse last night to fondle my lap.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.350
- You did.
- Rubbish. I'll tell you.

12:10.350 --> 12:11.950
He said "I'll give you a lift to the pub and.."

12:11.950 --> 12:14.170
We got into a Fiat Panda and he kept saying "Stop touching me."

12:14.170 --> 12:16.420
You can not touch someone!

12:16.420 --> 12:18.400
It's like sharing a bath with somebody. You've got...

12:18.400 --> 12:21.420
He's got "get on the back of my horse but don't touch me."

12:21.420 --> 12:24.720
He exploited the diminitive size of my panda

12:24.721 --> 12:27.220
to sit there going "Oh, I'm terribly sorry."

12:29.900 --> 12:32.100
Can I just get back to this list, OK?

12:32.100 --> 12:33.850
I want to give you the bottom 6.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.750
The 6 least reliable cars that you can buy.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.820
See if you can spot a trend here.

12:38.820 --> 12:43.570
Err...six from last, Peugeot 407, Citroen C8, Renault mижgane,

12:43.571 --> 12:47.570
Peugeot 307, Renault Espace, Peugeot 807

12:47.570 --> 12:49.250
They are all French.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.550
I know. French got better things to do than go on making cars.

12:52.551 --> 12:54.050
It's what it basically was.

12:54.050 --> 12:54.900
- Pardon?
- What?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.700
Oh for instance, France is a lovely country.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.900
- Oh, come on.
- Hang on, hong on. Where does Kristin Scott Thomas live?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.070
Paris.

13:01.850 --> 13:02.983
That might have something to do with

13:02.983 --> 13:05.270
your sudden spirited defense of France.

13:05.270 --> 13:06.720
No. Coz I've always liked France.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.200
- It is pathetic.
- I don't konw why you're laughing.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.350
You'd be exactly the same if Graham Norton is coming on.

13:14.070 --> 13:20.470
You won't? Anyway, that's the end of the news.

13:20.471 --> 13:23.270
Now, as you probably know,

13:23.270 --> 13:26.920
these days it's possible to make petrol from crops.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.100
and this gives us an idea.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.620
Why don't we give it a bash. I mean, how hard can it be?

13:32.620 --> 13:36.300
Well, one problem is that you would need to use tractors.

13:36.300 --> 13:40.370
And tractors is something that we know absolutely nothing about.

13:40.370 --> 13:44.320
So, the production office said "go on the internet, do some research,"

13:44.320 --> 13:47.250
"and then turn up at our test track with whichever tractor

13:47.251 --> 13:51.250
you think would be best for the job of growing petrol."

13:51.250 --> 13:53.920
Right, gentlemen, this is what I've come up with.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.450
That's the Fendt 930 Vario.

13:57.450 --> 13:59.420
It's 120,000 pounds.

13:59.420 --> 14:03.820
This is the Mercedes S class of agricultural vehicles.

14:03.820 --> 14:06.600
This's got every single toy imaginable.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.900
Well the best of all is it's got this computer, OK.

14:08.900 --> 14:14.500
And it will maintain it at a constant speed of 0.06 of 1 mile an hour

14:14.500 --> 14:16.500
This is the fastest he's ever been.

14:17.170 --> 14:19.450
Jeremy's choice turned up next.

14:19.450 --> 14:21.720
- There it is
- Jeremy, that's a digger.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.520
No, it isn't.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.320
That's a JCB Fasttrac something or rather

14:28.320 --> 14:30.900
and this is the tractor that the army use.

14:30.900 --> 14:34.420
Oh, the army. Well known of course all over the world as farmers.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.320
Just honestly, this, OK? It has...

14:39.420 --> 14:41.020
It has what?

14:41.020 --> 14:47.970
It has an 8.3L turbo charged engine. Unlike any other tractor,

14:47.970 --> 14:51.170
I think, top speed is unlimited.

14:51.170 --> 14:54.467
No, please, listen, seriously, if we're gonna

14:54.467 --> 14:56.850
make good quality petrol from our crop

14:56.850 --> 15:01.220
- Yeah?
- We wanna get the ploughing done well, not quickly, OK?

15:01.220 --> 15:04.700
Which is why I have bought this!

15:09.770 --> 15:12.120
That's a bloody tank, you idiot.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.950
It... It didn't look that big on my computer, to be honest.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.270
It's a Case STX Steiger.

15:20.270 --> 15:24.250
That's got a 16L turbo charged engine

15:24.250 --> 15:26.620
It weighs 24 tons.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.500
- It's just...
- How much is it?

15:29.500 --> 15:34.550
224,756 pounds

15:34.550 --> 15:35.720
What's its top speed?

15:35.720 --> 15:36.950
Err,

15:36.950 --> 15:37.870
- 20

15:37.870 --> 15:38.970
- 20
- 20

15:38.970 --> 15:40.100
- 41

15:40.100 --> 15:42.050
So this is therefore a faster plougher.

15:42.050 --> 15:44.150
You can't plough at 41 miles an hour though.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.350
Well, how fast do you plough?

15:45.350 --> 15:47.870
I don't know.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.850
Our ignorance about farming was a little embarrassing,

15:53.850 --> 15:56.970
so we dived into the first challenge.

15:56.970 --> 15:58.020
- Ready?
- It's the big moment.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.950
Farming has a very high suicide rates,

16:00.950 --> 16:03.270
which can be attributed to stress.

16:03.270 --> 16:07.220
The last thing you need therefore is a tractor that's confusing to operate.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.850
So to test user-friendliness, you must hitch up a trailer,

16:10.850 --> 16:13.370
get in, adjust the seat, turn on the lights,

16:13.370 --> 16:17.820
and then reverse your rig through our car park.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.570
Wohoo...

16:20.570 --> 16:22.450
Quite big, some of these things.

16:22.450 --> 16:23.770
It's a tight car park there.

16:25.770 --> 16:29.200
And unfortunately, it's always full of stuff.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.850
On that days for example,

16:30.850 --> 16:33.870
there was a very expensive modified Range Rover Sport,

16:33.870 --> 16:37.150
A prototype Astra with a new type diesel engine,

16:37.150 --> 16:40.520
and all our cherished TV creations.

16:43.470 --> 16:48.200
James went first and instantly regretted choosing the S Class.

17:06.550 --> 17:10.319
Fifteen minutes, James, and utter silence.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.720
I'm just making sure everything is right before I start...

17:12.720 --> 17:14.099
Start it now, then.

17:16.450 --> 17:19.900
It's very quiet. I say amazing modern tractors.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.750
Eventually he did get it started.

17:23.270 --> 17:25.770
And he had to find 1st gear

17:26.550 --> 17:30.870
So that' something to do with my bo... it's not that...that's

17:30.870 --> 17:33.870
It's now been 26 minutes.

17:33.870 --> 17:38.120
Hang on. There is the windscreen wiper

17:38.920 --> 17:41.800
Do you think he's found the gear lever?

17:41.800 --> 17:44.170
It's taken him 34 minutes.

17:45.420 --> 17:48.220
I've managed to adjust the steering wheel.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.600
It can't be that difficult.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.670
You'll notice, ladies and gentlemen, 1 hour has passed, the trailer's...

17:57.670 --> 18:00.450
And the tractor is no near it

18:00.450 --> 18:01.700
How did I do?

18:01.700 --> 18:04.770
Don't hold out too many hopes.

18:05.470 --> 18:11.270
Unbelievably, I have no trouble getting my JCB started and into gear.

18:11.270 --> 18:13.120
It moves, it leaves.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.550
- C'mon, a bit more, stop.
- Hitching the trailer was a doddle too.

18:15.550 --> 18:17.250
Yes!

18:17.250 --> 18:20.070
All I had to do now was reverse it.

18:20.070 --> 18:22.420
This of course is a 4-wheel trailer.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.520
Slightly harder to operate.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.770
It's the opposite of the opposite of what you think.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.150
- Wrong. - You're getting wronger.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.720
How can you crash into your own trailer?

18:36.800 --> 18:39.470
No. Oh, this is stupid.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.220
The thing interesting about Jeremy I find

18:41.221 --> 18:43.320
is he thinks problems can be solved by shouting.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.720
This is just ridiculous! It can't be done!

18:48.950 --> 18:50.650
He's getting further away.

18:50.970 --> 18:54.800
I'm not a quitter, but I'm quitting.

18:56.250 --> 19:00.770
Hammond being a country boy instantly bonded with the job in hand.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.620
Here we go.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.070
That's really annoying.

19:06.070 --> 19:07.500
Yeah, you see?

19:09.620 --> 19:11.370
I'm on the roll.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.820
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19:20.520 --> 19:22.700
I think I did clip it.

19:27.450 --> 19:29.770
How many are these worthy?

19:29.770 --> 19:32.920
None, since you did that.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.250
How did you get...

19:37.250 --> 19:39.150
Well, it weighs 24 tons, it's very big,

19:39.151 --> 19:41.950
you can't see much when you looking backwards. And I was...

19:41.950 --> 19:44.250
Frankly, we'd all made a hash of that challenge.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.870
It was probably best to move on.

19:46.870 --> 19:48.370
Right then, time for our next challenge.

19:48.370 --> 19:49.720
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.070
Here it is.

19:52.070 --> 19:56.670
The slowest thing ever to lap our track was the late Richard Whitely.

19:56.670 --> 19:58.900
He went a round in 2:06.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.200
Can your tractors beat this?

20:01.770 --> 20:04.250
- What, go slower than that?
- Yeah.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.050
That's stupid.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.470
Well what's the stop you just driving really slowly?

20:07.470 --> 20:09.600
Ah, no. We won't be driving. The Stig will.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.650
Oh, god.

20:10.650 --> 20:12.450
So is it the slowest or the fastest?

20:12.450 --> 20:15.950
It's the slowest. I've brought the fastest tractor down here.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.050
This is excellent.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.550
And with its top speed of 31,

20:20.550 --> 20:23.750
the Stig could hardly have been less bothered

20:23.751 --> 20:26.150
about the prospect of a lap in the Fendt.

20:26.150 --> 20:26.850
Go!

20:27.800 --> 20:30.570
That's good. That's good and useless. Get off the line.

20:30.570 --> 20:32.720
That doesn't exactly spin its wheels.

20:35.070 --> 20:39.600
And it's 1 min now, and he hasn't made it to Chicago.

20:39.600 --> 20:45.600
2 mins 1, 2, 3, coming up to Whitely's time, 5, 6

20:45.600 --> 20:48.150
And is it cross the...No

20:48.150 --> 20:51.400
The Stig's performance also wasn't helped by the fact that

20:51.401 --> 20:54.800
the James had adjusted the seat to its softest setting.

20:56.650 --> 20:59.270
-Oh my God!
-I'll be running.

20:59.270 --> 21:02.670
- Yes!
- What was it?

21:02.670 --> 21:04.150
3:28

21:04.150 --> 21:06.400
That's spectacularly slow.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.650
Hopefully, my office block would beat, Err, not beat, I mean, that time.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.150
Wheel spin! Wheel spin!

21:17.150 --> 21:20.500
No, that's bad. I don't want wheel spin.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.700
Abnormal quiet

21:26.700 --> 21:31.070
- What can we...
- How do you commentate on a tractor lap?

21:33.970 --> 21:37.670
- Go on the Hammerhead.
- If you notice that the Lamborghini tractor, they'll do

21:37.670 --> 21:38.750
Hold on, sorry...

21:38.750 --> 21:40.550
Sorry to interrupt, James, but will it understeer

21:40.550 --> 21:41.750
going round the Hammerhead?

21:41.750 --> 21:43.500
No. As I was saying,

21:45.650 --> 21:47.720
You know what, we've been lucky with this

21:47.720 --> 21:49.550
You know, I mean barely a cloud.

21:49.550 --> 21:51.850
No,no, it's /. It's the gorgeous weather.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.100
Why do things stay hot in the thermos flask

21:55.100 --> 21:56.450
for less time than they stay in the cold?

21:56.450 --> 22:00.850
- Well, it's interesting. Why...
- Don't go there. How does it keep being hot, in fact...

22:00.850 --> 22:04.870
As we finished afternoon tea, the Stig roamed home

22:04.870 --> 22:07.570
Come on, come on, yes!

22:07.570 --> 22:10.520
4:49

22:10.520 --> 22:13.200
In the speedy JCB GTI,

22:13.201 --> 22:17.620
that time wouldn't be easy to... not be, not, wait, hang on...

22:17.620 --> 22:18.621
Look at it, it's leaning.

22:18.920 --> 22:24.870
Of course it's leaning, it's a very very powerful 8. something L engine.

22:24.870 --> 22:31.270
In fact, the JCB GTI was so fast that even the Stig had trouble coping.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.520
- Come on.
- No, slow is good, you fool.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.600
The last corner, turning in...

22:42.270 --> 22:45.500
Cross the line. Read it and weep.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.170
2:57

22:47.200 --> 22:53.170
- No, that's... Jeremy, the slowest wins.
- Rubbish.

22:53.170 --> 22:57.170
Hopefully, there'd be no disagreement about the final challenge.

22:57.170 --> 23:01.620
The most important characteristics for any tractor are fuel efficiency,

23:01.620 --> 23:03.800
reliability and long service life.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.970
So your next challenge is a dragrace.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.700
Oh, god.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.850
I've got this one completely sewn up.

23:10.850 --> 23:14.670
No, no, no, you haven't. You misunderstood, it a drag-race.

23:14.670 --> 23:16.720
We each have to look around the whole of the Top Gear site

23:16.721 --> 23:19.720
and find something big and heavy to drag.

23:19.720 --> 23:20.970
In the race, we get more points

23:20.971 --> 23:22.970
for the bigger and heavier the thing is...

23:27.020 --> 23:32.100
I hitched up Jeremy's 'Toyboata' Hilux,

23:32.101 --> 23:38.100
the S class country cottage, my Triumph Herald sailing boat,

23:38.100 --> 23:39.520
and, well, a few other things.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.320
Nice try, but a bit wet.

24:03.450 --> 24:06.766
Even the office's lack of wheels was no problem

24:06.766 --> 24:10.650
for my metal mammoth's 1,600 torques.

24:12.850 --> 24:14.750
Again, good effort.

24:14.750 --> 24:18.770
But to my mind, still lacking ambition.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.450
Right, I'll think low range.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.100
Three Two One Go!

24:49.970 --> 24:51.450
This is it

24:51.450 --> 24:54.750
We're away in the most ridiculous dragrace in history...

24:54.750 --> 24:57.400
James's cars are all over the place.

24:57.400 --> 25:01.500
the convoy's shaking a bit, shaking a lot.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.170
No quite as brightly as how I was hoping.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.200
Come on, come on. it's a tractor.

25:08.200 --> 25:13.170
I've now reached, after 25 sec, 1.3 miles an hour.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.050
What do you think? That's what it spares, it's all over the place.

25:16.050 --> 25:19.650
There's a big weave going on. Oh, I've lost one.

25:19.650 --> 25:23.600
Wahl, come off my way. It's gonna be a disaster.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.400
It's the finishing line.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.200
Not the most elegant finishing in the world

25:40.201 --> 25:43.070
but I believe I have beaten old merc Hammond.

25:46.870 --> 25:48.870
Wake me up when we get there.

25:56.170 --> 26:00.043
Now, emm. Obviously we will be picking that up later on

26:00.043 --> 26:02.043
when we start actually growing petrol

26:02.044 --> 26:05.305
But now it's time to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.

26:05.306 --> 26:07.719
My guest tonight is a Hollywood star

26:07.720 --> 26:10.730
She is currently staring on the West End stage

26:10.731 --> 26:14.023
and one of the great classic, she is the epitome of cool. She...

26:14.024 --> 26:16.155
Wow, I wish your heart fluttering as you talk about it.

26:16.264 --> 26:18.550
And your tongue goes really big in your mouth...

26:18.585 --> 26:20.306
Will you two grow up?

26:20.307 --> 26:23.575
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Kristin Scott Thomas

26:27.215 --> 26:28.518
How are you?

26:28.519 --> 26:29.901
Very well.

26:31.528 --> 26:33.268
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

26:34.055 --> 26:35.575
Well, that's it.

26:39.429 --> 26:41.337
And my life is now complete.

26:41.784 --> 26:43.982
So is it been the most horrible day of your life?

26:43.983 --> 26:50.036
No no, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed driving fast and relatively dangerously.

26:50.036 --> 26:51.786
Well it wasn't fast, coz it was only...

26:51.787 --> 26:53.283
Well it was very fast for me.

26:53.284 --> 26:54.070
- Was it?
- Yes.

26:54.071 --> 26:54.960
Coz I'm very slow,

26:54.960 --> 26:57.802
I usually drive with my nose on the windscreen and...

26:57.803 --> 27:01.200
So you're over here at the moment obviously ... staring in a play

27:01.201 --> 27:02.204
- Yes
- In the West End.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.088
So does that mean you're living in London?

27:04.089 --> 27:06.766
Um...Yeah, during the play. Yeah.

27:06.767 --> 27:08.797
During the play. And so what are you driving around London, then?

27:08.798 --> 27:09.990
A Gewiss

27:10.785 --> 27:12.651
- Gewiss, the little electric.
- Yeah.

27:12.652 --> 27:14.328
Nice car, I've always liked them.

27:16.191 --> 27:17.680
I happen to know that's a lie.

27:17.681 --> 27:21.745
No, no, no...It's all just a nonsense, people have misquoted me.

27:21.746 --> 27:22.936
I'm thinking of getting one.

27:22.937 --> 27:25.658
No, well you should, but I don't think you'd fit in it. That's the problem.

27:25.659 --> 27:28.753
No, I would. I'd saw bits off. I...I'd get in.

27:28.938 --> 27:32.580
Mine's got tiger stripes all over it, it's very attractive as well.

27:32.615 --> 27:34.660
I like that idea, I'd...

27:36.646 --> 27:38.944
- Now you live in Paris, most of the time.
- Yes.

27:38.945 --> 27:40.572
How does that compare to London?

27:40.573 --> 27:42.591
Um, traffic's worse.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.688
Um, I like driving in Paris, I don't like driving in London very much.

27:46.689 --> 27:48.590
It's very different in driving style.

27:48.591 --> 27:50.175
- That you have to adjust...
- Well , Yeah.

27:50.176 --> 27:54.300
I mean I've got 4 traffic offences in my first week in London.

27:54.301 --> 27:55.212
What the Gewiss?

27:55.213 --> 27:56.732
- Yes, a bit, yeah.
- No way.

27:56.733 --> 27:57.953
Obviously not speeding.

27:57.954 --> 28:00.421
- No, that would be difficult.
- No, that would be impossible.

28:00.438 --> 28:02.780
You did once describe driving round the
Arc De Triomphe

28:02.781 --> 28:04.380
as one of life's great adventures.

28:04.381 --> 28:05.365
Oh, I love it.

28:06.275 --> 28:07.629
It's fantastically frightening.

28:07.630 --> 28:10.181
I did it once in a Ford GT, that was very tricky.

28:10.182 --> 28:11.732
What's a Ford GT?

28:11.733 --> 28:14.548
It's a...It's not a...not a particularly nice car.

28:16.412 --> 28:19.187
It damages the enviroument quite badly, I don't really like it.

28:19.188 --> 28:22.400
but there is a moment when you just get
to the Arc De Triomphe

28:22.401 --> 28:24.421
and just think "Here we go!"

28:24.422 --> 28:26.276
I love it, it's like ... It is great fun.

28:26.278 --> 28:27.882
The thing is, the trick with the Arc De Triomphe

28:27.883 --> 28:31.100
is you just have to not look where who's coming at you

28:31.102 --> 28:33.898
Just look where you're going and have a really badly beaten-up car.

28:33.899 --> 28:35.620
Yeah, no, never try in a nice car, coz...

28:35.621 --> 28:37.480
Always a worse car you lay your hands on.

28:37.481 --> 28:38.825
coz then everyone would avoid you.

28:38.826 --> 28:39.759
And this is one of the reasons

28:39.759 --> 28:42.383
why I've sort of got you as the Cool Wall Muse

28:42.384 --> 28:45.054
if you see what I mean, because you do your struggle in Europe.

28:45.055 --> 28:46.252
in Paris, in Europe, to me,

28:46.252 --> 28:50.544
it's just so much cooler than Los Angeles and even New York.

28:50.545 --> 28:54.169
But do you mind awfully if I just run a few cars past you?

28:54.373 --> 28:56.101
- Yeah.
- Establish their coolness.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.790
This, OK? Obviously this is very cool.

28:58.791 --> 29:00.031
- Yes
- Gewiss

29:00.032 --> 29:02.215
- What?
- That's mine, I haven't got my specs(spectacles) on though.

29:02.216 --> 29:05.379
I'm sorry mate, you discribed it as a "wart" last year.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.503
- No.
- It is beautiful. It is beautiful.

29:08.504 --> 29:12.626
The only problem that you might find is getting into it.

29:12.627 --> 29:14.593
And at rainy night you have to choose.

29:14.593 --> 29:17.062
Between windscreen wiper and lights

29:17.063 --> 29:21.069
You see, that isn't in the brochure.

29:21.070 --> 29:23.231
But I would just like to say that when I said it was a wart

29:23.232 --> 29:26.752
I was thinking more in terms of Cindy Crawford's beauty spot.

29:26.753 --> 29:28.690
But I love this car, I absolutely love this car.

29:28.691 --> 29:29.891
It's absolutely brilliant for London.

29:29.892 --> 29:32.517
- So it's very very very cool.
- Thank you very much. And that's very cool.

29:32.518 --> 29:36.155
Now we've often said on the Cool Wall that we anticipate,

29:36.155 --> 29:37.431
coz you live in Paris, that

29:37.432 --> 29:40.864
small European cars like those, OK? Renaults and...

29:40.865 --> 29:43.422
That's a little Citroen and that's a little Fiat.

29:43.423 --> 29:45.405
They're cool, are we right?

29:45.406 --> 29:47.399
Yes, I think the Renaults are, Yeah.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.827
- Not what? Not the Fiat?
- Not that one.

29:49.828 --> 29:52.198
- The little Renault Clio?
- That one's little bit dodgy at the back.

29:52.199 --> 29:53.489
A bit what? dodgy?

29:53.490 --> 29:55.330
- Don't like the back at sort of...
- Yeah now I agree.

29:56.070 --> 29:59.131
Crap, absolutely crap, Fiat Puntos are rubbish,

29:59.131 --> 30:01.235
somebody quitely go and move it down.

30:01.236 --> 30:02.759
This is awful.

30:03.883 --> 30:07.641
- And, we've also said this kind of thing, Red Bentley...
- I love that.

30:07.641 --> 30:08.504
Show it to me.

30:11.321 --> 30:12.806
How do you feel now?

30:12.807 --> 30:14.925
I may have accidentaly said in the past

30:14.925 --> 30:17.038
it was a Chelsea footballer's car that.

30:17.039 --> 30:18.339
But it is!

30:18.340 --> 30:19.286
But that's cool.

30:19.287 --> 30:20.314
But it's fabulous.

30:20.315 --> 30:23.911
4 years of your Cool Wall has just been destroyed.

30:24.834 --> 30:28.343
I took a chainsaw to it last week, you're machineguning it. Right, Good.

30:28.344 --> 30:29.120
Red Bentley will do.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.522
4-Wheel-Drive cars.

30:30.523 --> 30:31.586
I don't really like those.

30:31.587 --> 30:34.091
Yes, I moved them all down last week.

30:34.092 --> 30:35.608
I use to had one and I got rid of it.

30:35.609 --> 30:36.603
Did you? which did you have?

30:36.604 --> 30:39.596
I had a really nice one, it was a big Volvo...Um something.

30:40.931 --> 30:41.909
XC90?

30:41.910 --> 30:43.995
- I have no idea that. It was just...
- I've got one of those.

30:43.996 --> 30:45.717
you know those really huge ones?

30:45.718 --> 30:47.205
- Yeah.
- I liked it.

30:47.206 --> 30:48.387
There are seven seats in it.

30:48.591 --> 30:50.748
- Yes, that's right.
- That's what I've got.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.418
Born in the same year.

30:52.658 --> 30:54.387
Don't, thank you.

30:57.411 --> 30:59.179
As Richard Hammond.

30:59.180 --> 31:01.701
But...Got out of that one.

31:01.702 --> 31:05.418
Just, right. Can I just say, Rolls-Royce?

31:06.508 --> 31:09.469
Emm, I am sort of slightly ambivalent about Rolls-Royce.

31:09.470 --> 31:11.246
Yeah, Richard Hammond came down in one this morning.

31:11.247 --> 31:14.375
What? That is lying.

31:15.299 --> 31:18.650
- Think you've made up a bit fool of yourself then mate.
- This is desperate.

31:18.651 --> 31:19.887
I told you shouldn't have done.

31:19.888 --> 31:24.744
Right now, most important, Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.

31:24.745 --> 31:28.726
- This is ... yeah.
- What?

31:28.727 --> 31:30.537
It's pathetic, isn't it?

31:30.538 --> 31:33.021
Yeah!

31:39.479 --> 31:41.186
Anybody's got a knife?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.609
Right ... so cancel that.

31:44.610 --> 31:46.576
- What? order?
- Yes

31:47.273 --> 31:48.427
So you've got one of these?

31:48.427 --> 31:49.249
No.

31:51.871 --> 31:54.084
I thought you'd have a Volvo, like a sensible person.

31:54.085 --> 31:55.831
- A what?
- A Volvo.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.531
No, the children go around in a Volvo.

31:57.532 --> 31:59.657
Obviously because they're going to school in back.

31:59.658 --> 32:03.298
I have to have something else, and I thought...that would be...rubbish.

32:03.299 --> 32:04.624
And I ... I don't know what...

32:04.625 --> 32:09.399
Now if I may, we'll move on, coz you're over here staring in the "Seagull"?

32:09.399 --> 32:10.525
- In the "Seagull".
- Chekhov play.

32:10.526 --> 32:12.664
Now, "Seagull" is not about a seagull.

32:12.665 --> 32:15.096
No, do you want to know what's it about?

32:15.097 --> 32:17.399
Well, I think, I might...can I just guess?

32:17.400 --> 32:21.537
Does it see act 1, not much happens, and act 2 not much, then act 3...

32:21.538 --> 32:22.561
Everything happens.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.487
Well, it's in between the acts somebody goes off

32:24.487 --> 32:26.838
and tries to shoot himself in the head and misses

32:26.839 --> 32:27.631
It misses.

32:27.632 --> 32:29.499
That's when everyone's in the bar and then he come back

32:29.499 --> 32:31.326
he's got a bandage on his head.

32:31.327 --> 32:33.970
- Now this is completely sold out
- Yeah

32:33.971 --> 32:36.307
Can't get tickets and God knows I've tried.

32:37.393 --> 32:39.051
Have you got a thing about Chekhov?

32:39.052 --> 32:41.671
I just really like Chekhov...No, I haven't got a thing about Chekhov.

32:41.672 --> 32:44.130
But I just find that...

32:46.881 --> 32:49.370
I've only done two plays, am I boring you already?

32:49.371 --> 32:53.607
"Jezza loves Kristin"

32:57.353 --> 32:59.232
That's so sweet.

32:59.233 --> 33:00.881
It's not, it's pathetic.

33:02.053 --> 33:03.727
I'm touched.

33:03.728 --> 33:05.780
Anybody wants a job presenting Top Gear

33:05.780 --> 33:09.802
the address is BBC Wood Lane London W12 7TS

33:09.803 --> 33:13.458
Now, we're going to find out obviously in a minute, how your lap was.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.083
Do you wanna tell us how it went?

33:16.084 --> 33:18.066
There was a bit of boggy moment, wasn't it?

33:18.067 --> 33:18.982
Did you get off?

33:18.983 --> 33:20.512
I went off and sank.

33:20.513 --> 33:21.624
- Really?
- Yes.

33:22.328 --> 33:24.453
And I saw an ambulance coming speeding towards me

33:24.454 --> 33:27.886
Not to rescue me but just tow the car out of the...

33:28.825 --> 33:30.863
Did you get it too fast or get lost?

33:30.864 --> 33:32.539
No, I just sort of gave up steering.

33:35.358 --> 33:37.836
Well, I tell you what, who'd like to see the lap?

33:37.837 --> 33:38.554
I'm one.

33:39.512 --> 33:41.276
Ok, let's play the tape.

33:43.615 --> 33:44.840
Parisian start.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.534
- En, looks good.
- I sing.

33:48.535 --> 33:51.664
No this is smooth and perfect in everywhere,

33:51.664 --> 33:53.264
I can't see anything wrong with that.

33:55.761 --> 33:59.659
And into Chicago, and again, no, absolutely bang-on.

34:01.992 --> 34:03.553
Hugh Grant did that

34:04.677 --> 34:07.405
<i>And that was my favourite part
break hard enough...Bloody hell.</i>

34:09.181 --> 34:11.362
And then watch this, I can see where you've been off there.

34:11.362 --> 34:12.402
It's awfully muddy.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.618
Now here, did you go fast..flat-out through here?

34:15.619 --> 34:17.572
No I tried, but it's quite difficult.

34:18.492 --> 34:23.748
No that't flat-out, I can hear the tires tortured screaming...Oh look at that.

34:23.748 --> 34:25.013
- Oh that was me?
- I know.

34:25.895 --> 34:27.362
Is this the fastest you've ever gone?

34:27.362 --> 34:28.876
That's not very fast.

34:32.154 --> 34:35.554
And now,  here we are, across the line, perfect!

34:39.601 --> 34:41.068
Now

34:46.645 --> 34:48.757
Where do you think you might have come?

34:48.757 --> 34:50.396
- Where do you...?
- Probably Brian...

34:51.271 --> 34:53.909
What down here? What? Brian Cox?

34:53.909 --> 34:56.853
I don't know, I have no idea, I have no idea of what time it was...

34:57.940 --> 35:02.851
You did it in 1:54

35:03.291 --> 35:04.836
- There.
-Thank you.

35:07.759 --> 35:08.393
Now

35:12.826 --> 35:15.512
Faster than Philip Glenister, faster than Rick Wakeman

35:15.512 --> 35:18.283
faster than Brian Cox and much faster than Jimmy Carr.

35:20.345 --> 35:22.675
I have to say I thought that you were better at that

35:22.675 --> 35:25.556
than I would be in a Chekhov play.

35:26.947 --> 35:28.681
That's...Yes, that'll be.

35:28.736 --> 35:30.250
It's been an absolute pleasure having you here

35:30.250 --> 35:31.835
as I'm sure you're gonna appreciate.

35:31.836 --> 35:33.940
Ladies and gentlemen, Kristin Scott Thomas.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.657
Now, this is a super car.

35:45.692 --> 35:48.478
It's built primarily to be fast.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.060
But above super cars there is another level.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.459
Hyper cars.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.726
And those are mostly about showing off.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.945
Which is what you were doing in that interview.

35:56.946 --> 36:00.251
- A bit.
- You have let the program down, you let yourself down.

36:00.252 --> 36:02.278
- Sorry mate. We're just...
- Embarrassment. Anyway

36:02.559 --> 36:04.313
He does have a point, OK?

36:04.314 --> 36:07.073
Super cars are designed to mess with G Forces,

36:07.074 --> 36:10.436
Hyper cars are designed to mess with G Strings.

36:11.046 --> 36:14.527
And king of the hyper car makers has always been Lamborghini.

36:14.528 --> 36:16.600
Yeah. So cars like the Diablo, the Countach,

36:16.600 --> 36:18.672
they were brilliant cars to look at.

36:18.673 --> 36:20.751
They all made you feel like you're 10 years old.

36:20.786 --> 36:24.026
But the fact is they were always horrid to drive.

36:24.027 --> 36:27.771
No, they were. They were designed for Rod Stewart, not Jackie Stewart.

36:27.806 --> 36:31.194
So, you're probably expecting more of the same from the latest product.

36:31.195 --> 36:34.721
The Murcielago LP640

36:38.990 --> 36:41.989
Here it is. And of course it's very dramatic.

36:44.176 --> 36:48.717
It's also very large and it turns a great many heads as you drive along.

36:48.718 --> 36:51.813
Plus, it makes a lot of noise.

36:57.834 --> 37:01.738
But if you actually look at it, it's not that outlandish.

37:02.852 --> 37:05.179
It was actually styled by a Belgium.

37:05.180 --> 37:06.580
Same chap who did the Audi A2

37:06.580 --> 37:10.278
and there are no big spoilors spreading out of it.

37:10.279 --> 37:14.078
There're no rotating knives. There aren't even any machine guns.

37:17.116 --> 37:20.653
The vents only open when the engine gets really hot

37:20.654 --> 37:23.237
the rest of the time they are hiden away.

37:24.035 --> 37:27.618
There is a gaint oil cooling aperture on one side of the car.

37:28.298 --> 37:31.108
But instead of fitting a fake on the other, they haven't botherd.

37:31.109 --> 37:34.449
There is no style for style sake here.

37:35.268 --> 37:36.912
And look at the exhaust pipe.

37:36.913 --> 37:39.046
It's the same width as the channel tunnel.

37:39.047 --> 37:40.135
But there is only one.

37:40.135 --> 37:43.509
Not 17 like you get in most hyper cars.

37:44.222 --> 37:49.214
You even get a device that raises the nose for going over speed humps.

37:51.574 --> 37:54.088
This is all fine. But what is the point of a Lamborgini

37:54.088 --> 37:57.950
that doesn't have space thruster sticking out of the side?

37:59.435 --> 38:01.300
Of course, you still get scissor doors

38:01.300 --> 38:02.675
and when you step inside you find

38:02.675 --> 38:06.589
the steering wheel isn't quite in front of where you're sitting.

38:06.590 --> 38:09.853
But there is room for your head. And you can see out.

38:10.430 --> 38:11.856
Can even see behind!

38:14.942 --> 38:19.444
Then when you're driving along normally, it feels very civilized.

38:19.445 --> 38:21.920
I mean obviously it's not a Honda Civic.

38:21.920 --> 38:26.611
You can't turn left for example, coz the indicator stalk'll hit your knee.

38:26.801 --> 38:29.889
And it does 8 miles to the gallon.

38:30.704 --> 38:32.056
... or four.

38:32.895 --> 38:36.414
But that's set you don't have to raise your voice to have a conversation.

38:36.449 --> 38:39.455
It's got satellite navigation and it's got air-conditioning.

38:40.133 --> 38:42.600
Which unlike the air-conditioning systems in Lambos of all

38:42.600 --> 38:45.983
it isn't like being coughed on ... by a mouse.

38:51.126 --> 38:53.287
This is all very worrying.

38:53.288 --> 38:58.037
You see it's 8 years since Captain Sensibles of Audi took over Lamborghini.

38:59.021 --> 39:02.916
And now they seems to be taking away its soul.

39:03.357 --> 39:07.165
The only reason we ever liked Lamborghinis is because they were silly.

39:07.166 --> 39:11.191
Taking that away is like taking away the sunshine from a Summer holiday.

39:11.192 --> 39:14.641
You're left with ... nothing.

39:19.121 --> 39:21.126
Except for one thing.

39:21.616 --> 39:26.046
Audi have replaced the lunacy with something else.

39:30.714 --> 39:37.268
They've increased the size of the V12 from 6.2 to 6.5 litres.

39:37.303 --> 39:41.596
But what it delivers is simply staggering.

39:47.788 --> 39:52.080
then you get 500 carbon dioxides

39:52.115 --> 39:55.554
and 640 BHP

39:57.072 --> 39:59.792
That's more than you get from a Porsche Carrera GT

39:59.792 --> 40:02.520
or a Mclaren Mercedes SLR

40:02.562 --> 40:04.477
it's more than you get from a Zonda.

40:08.238 --> 40:10.866
The result is spectacular.

40:10.901 --> 40:14.369
This is not a light car, but my God it's fast.

40:15.369 --> 40:18.723
Properly, savagely fast.

40:21.813 --> 40:24.395
0 to 60 takes 3 and a bit seconds.

40:26.014 --> 40:28.328
The top speed is 200 and...

40:29.411 --> 40:31.354
Tell you what, let's find out.

40:36.376 --> 40:40.010
fastest anything's gone down here is about 190.

40:42.875 --> 40:46.249
That's 200, we're quicker than anything ever.

40:47.414 --> 40:49.510
Look at that. 207!

40:50.410 --> 40:52.881
207 miles and hour!

40:58.653 --> 41:01.350
Of course figures like these are sort of meaningless.

41:01.351 --> 41:02.423
They're hard to get your head drown

41:02.424 --> 41:06.936
So what I've done, is organized a demostration.

41:06.937 --> 41:09.584
What we have here is a Golf GTI

41:09.585 --> 41:12.784
And what we are going to do now is have a half mile drag race

41:12.819 --> 41:17.879
To show the difference between a fast car and the Murcielago.

41:19.119 --> 41:22.005
Ok now this has Formula 1 style launch control

41:22.040 --> 41:25.657
What you do is hit the sport button...Murcielago

41:26.199 --> 41:28.929
Turn the traction control off and then floor the throttle.

41:28.953 --> 41:31.961
when the revs hit 4000 the clutch will bang in.

41:31.962 --> 41:33.235
and we'll be off.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.201
Here we go!

41:43.744 --> 41:44.837
Wow...

41:45.565 --> 41:46.518
coughed on.

41:50.618 --> 41:52.173
Big Wow..

42:04.230 --> 42:07.761
Now you might imagine that this sort of power doesn't come cheap.

42:07.762 --> 42:11.664
and there is some evidence to support that if you look at the options list.

42:11.665 --> 42:15.244
That little bit of carbon fibre there on the center console

42:15.245 --> 42:17.015
4,000 pounds

42:17.015 --> 42:20.484
Carbon breaks, 7,780 pounds.

42:20.485 --> 42:24.334
If you want those break calipers, these things, you want those painting

42:24.335 --> 42:26.166
That's 600 pounds.

42:26.167 --> 42:29.415
Err.. transparent engine cover, you see that on the back.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.221
4,000 pounds.

42:31.221 --> 42:34.733
flappy paddle gearbox, 6,250.

42:36.037 --> 42:39.843
You'd need a flappy paddle head to spend that.

42:39.844 --> 42:41.407
All those are just...

42:46.319 --> 42:50.590
But amazingly the actual car only costs 190,000 pounds.

42:50.591 --> 42:54.432
That's about half of what you pay for a normal hyper car.

42:56.533 --> 42:58.932
So, it's quite well priced.

42:58.933 --> 43:01.193
It's hugely powerful.

43:01.194 --> 43:03.334
and it's surprisingly elegant.

43:10.296 --> 43:13.475
But do not, for one minute, be tricked into thinking

43:13.475 --> 43:17.740
that the king of the hyper cars has become a super car.

43:20.721 --> 43:25.526
In the twisty stuff it's still a card-carrying lunatic.

43:25.633 --> 43:29.125
You take one liberty with it and trust me on this,

43:29.126 --> 43:31.370
You are going down.

43:34.345 --> 43:37.374
Here we go, into neutral, and we're going backwards.

43:48.602 --> 43:54.232
So, it's still really a car for show off so not driving then.

43:54.233 --> 43:56.197
It's kind of half way.

43:56.198 --> 43:58.225
You see the thing is, if you're in a super car.

43:58.226 --> 44:00.542
and you go out there and you reach the limit

44:00.543 --> 44:03.138
you know, the limit of grip, and it'll start to slide.

44:03.139 --> 44:06.446
and you can hold that slide coz you're on the air field it doesn't matter.

44:06.447 --> 44:09.482
This, 4-wheel-drive, so you've got tons of grip.

44:09.483 --> 44:11.650
tons and tons, and then when you get to the limit...

44:11.651 --> 44:12.832
It's off.

44:12.832 --> 44:15.024
It's a really dim witted 4-wheel-drive system somehow.

44:15.025 --> 44:17.394
It's just, you cannot push it beyond the limit.

44:17.395 --> 44:19.248
So you can't really drive it to the limit because...

44:19.249 --> 44:20.956
Or anywhere near the limit.

44:20.957 --> 44:24.467
The punishment then for just over doing it by 1 percent is certain death.

44:24.468 --> 44:27.320
Absolutely, emm, happyly however.

44:27.815 --> 44:31.867
We have a man on the team, who laughs in the face of death.

44:32.629 --> 44:36.388
Some say that he sucks the moisture from ducks.

44:38.921 --> 44:43.635
And that his crash helmet is modelled on Britney Spear's head,

44:45.256 --> 44:48.777
all we know is, he's called the Stig.

44:50.437 --> 44:54.367
And he's off, now show off or not? This is still a fiercely quick car.

44:54.367 --> 44:58.676
The question is, can it knock the Koenigsegg off the top of our lap board.

44:59.255 --> 45:02.029
Seeming it doesn't bite Stig in the face on the way.

45:02.029 --> 45:03.780
So going OK so far.

45:04.747 --> 45:07.112
Radio: The love making was hesitant and tender.

45:07.112 --> 45:09.664
He didn't hurt or frighten her she'd feared.

45:09.665 --> 45:13.465
More romantic fiction dribble there as he powers round Chicago

45:13.466 --> 45:16.012
keeping it very tidy, which he has to do

45:16.012 --> 45:18.311
Coz you can't stick the tail out.

45:18.451 --> 45:20.328
Here he comes into Hammerhead.

45:20.992 --> 45:24.841
Yes look at that, he's absolutely keeping it on the raggedy edge.

45:25.609 --> 45:28.873
Radio: But the most beautiful part of all was her smile.

45:29.153 --> 45:32.027
Right let's see what the... what the Lambo can do now.

45:32.028 --> 45:35.400
This is it, this is where it can unleash that fearsome fire power.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.224
coming down into the tires here.

45:37.522 --> 45:39.954
That is quick even moving the camera.

45:39.955 --> 45:41.566
Two corners left.

45:41.567 --> 45:44.572
Ok, chucks it in, right on the limit of grip now.

45:44.573 --> 45:46.892
belt up to Gambon, turning in

45:46.893 --> 45:49.841
Look at that, keeping the tail in check and across the line.

45:53.658 --> 45:55.177
Where do you think he came?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.395
- Fourth.
- Fourth?

45:57.396 --> 46:00.603
Not fourth. Not fourth.

46:00.638 --> 46:03.311
It came...mmm

46:04.418 --> 46:06.573
there, look at there ladies and gentlemen

46:06.608 --> 46:09.008
Second, fourth... sixth place!

46:09.009 --> 46:12.434
1:19.8 the same as the Carrera GT.

46:12.435 --> 46:15.116
The sixth fastest car...

46:16.957 --> 46:18.317
That's a hyper car!

46:21.070 --> 46:25.100
Now, from last year we decided to grow our own petrol.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.450
and earlier on in the show,

46:26.450 --> 46:29.055
you saw us testing 3 tractors to decide

46:29.055 --> 46:31.070
which one would be best for the job.

46:31.070 --> 46:34.170
And we couldn't decide, so we took all three.

46:34.170 --> 46:39.120
Yes, we had the tractors and now it was time to start farming.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.150
This is BBC Radio 4.

46:42.150 --> 46:44.220
Now, it's Farming Today this week

46:44.220 --> 46:46.220
Good morning. A new report...

46:46.220 --> 46:49.000
This is the 25-acre field

46:49.000 --> 46:52.270
where we'll be growing us first crop of Top Gear petrol.

46:52.270 --> 46:54.770
We had just 1 day to get it sewn

46:54.770 --> 46:57.400
and immediately, there was a problem.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.150
Before we could start ploughing

47:01.150 --> 47:03.450
this lot would have to be evicted.

47:03.450 --> 47:05.420
So how do you clear sheep?

47:05.420 --> 47:07.070
Call Fred Dibnah.

47:07.070 --> 47:08.750
He is dead.

47:08.750 --> 47:12.020
Not Dibnah is it? It's Fred Drabble

47:12.020 --> 47:15.970
You mean Phil Drabble. He's dead as well.

47:15.970 --> 47:17.670
So what shall we do?

47:17.670 --> 47:19.650
Could use dynamite.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.670
Eventually, the job was given to Hammond and Top Gear dog.

47:24.670 --> 47:27.570
TG, run at them. Come on. TG, come on.

47:27.570 --> 47:29.020
Who didn't seem to be in the mood.

47:29.020 --> 47:31.950
TG, come. TG, come here.

47:31.950 --> 47:34.600
This is just me doing it. This is stupid. TG, come...

47:34.600 --> 47:38.200
Meanwhile, James and I set about the complexities of the day.

47:38.200 --> 47:42.450
There, it's really very simple. Our rented field is 25 acres big.

47:42.450 --> 47:45.200
It's a field where we currently filming one dog and its man.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.870
TG, just round one up.

47:47.870 --> 47:51.070
And we're gonna plant this, it's oilseed rape.

47:51.070 --> 47:55.620
And when it's harvested, we should get 15 tons of rape seed oil.

47:55.620 --> 47:58.800
Yeah, and what we are gonna do is rent a cycle-distilling machine, isn't it?

47:58.800 --> 48:00.450
- Yeah.
- And anyone can do that.

48:00.450 --> 48:06.720
And then we'll convert those 15 tons into 3,000 gallons of petrol.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.020
And that's enough to get my Ford GT to the shops and back.

48:10.020 --> 48:10.970
Absolutely.

48:10.970 --> 48:15.800
And it's also enough to drive a typical family car what, 90,000 miles?

48:16.470 --> 48:19.950
No, just go the other way! That way!

48:19.950 --> 48:20.950
- Hammond.
- Hurry up.

48:22.170 --> 48:25.750
- That's a useless dog.
- He is useless.

48:26.650 --> 48:28.370
Not one.

48:28.850 --> 48:32.220
Eventually the sheep were cleared by a proper dog.

48:32.220 --> 48:34.800
So we could get going with our tractors.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.070
But that gave us another problem.

48:37.750 --> 48:41.500
Guys, is this the only way into the field?

48:42.100 --> 48:43.150
It was.

48:43.150 --> 48:46.120
And it wasn't exactly the work of Brunel.

48:47.420 --> 48:52.320
Nevertheless, James crept over slowly and carefully in his Fendt.

48:54.220 --> 48:58.170
And then I went over in my sports tractor.

48:58.170 --> 48:59.550
Floor it.

49:02.700 --> 49:07.270
So fast that I broke it. This seemed to annoy Hammond.

49:07.270 --> 49:09.500
This weighs 24 tons.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.800
You've broken it with half of that.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.650
I will see if... Wait a moment. Would you just grab that...

49:14.650 --> 49:17.250
Then we made things worse.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.320
Avoid that there.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.250
Who chose this field?

49:22.250 --> 49:25.520
We spent ages trying to help him.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.550
Got it.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.950
Oh, forget it, May. It at least weighs half a ton.

49:31.950 --> 49:33.720
- I can't even lift it at this end.
- Is it oak?

49:33.720 --> 49:36.450
Can you just go to this side and avoid that bit.

49:36.450 --> 49:39.320
Of course May, yeah. I'll go on one side of the weak bridge.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.500
Come on.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.720
If he falls in, I'm going to die laughing.

49:49.520 --> 49:53.850
To avoid the broken slipper, I had to go right over the edge.

49:55.400 --> 49:58.820
I can't see anything. I've no idea what it's doing.

50:00.070 --> 50:01.370
Straight for a bit.

50:01.370 --> 50:04.400
OK. Straight comes, come forwards.

50:10.700 --> 50:12.720
Don't, stop, stop.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.800
Piece of cake.

50:29.720 --> 50:31.320
Now, we were in the field.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.470
Our first job was to plough it.

50:33.470 --> 50:35.928
And Hammond had gone for some machinery from,

50:35.928 --> 50:39.000
I think, Battlestar Galactica.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.820
Have you seen the size of my plough.

50:42.820 --> 50:43.920
Oh, yeah!

50:43.920 --> 50:46.320
Not feel this is the right weather for ploughing.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.750
Because our training at the track,

50:50.750 --> 50:53.300
we had no trouble getting the ploughs hitched.

50:57.450 --> 51:00.950
And then we got into our ploughing positions.

51:04.170 --> 51:07.100
Right, we've divided the field up into 3 equal parts,

51:07.100 --> 51:09.020
each of us gets two telegraph poles.

51:09.020 --> 51:12.400
Yes, then we're gonna see who can do their ploughing the fastest.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.020
No, we are gonna see who can do it the best.

51:15.020 --> 51:18.020
And because we don't know anything about ploughing,

51:18.020 --> 51:22.350
we've invited some ploughing judges who judge ploughing.

51:22.350 --> 51:26.420
And they explain to James just what they've been looking for.

51:26.420 --> 51:29.900
Every furrow, absolutely identical in every way

51:29.900 --> 51:32.400
we're looking for all the trash to be buried,

51:32.400 --> 51:34.650
we're looking for no dips and mounts.

51:34.650 --> 51:36.520
A good seed bed for the next crop.

51:36.520 --> 51:38.520
You sound like a Yorkshireman, are you?

51:38.520 --> 51:39.270
I am a Yorkshireman, Yeah.

51:39.270 --> 51:40.500
I used to live in Yorkshire, where about?

51:40.500 --> 51:41.550
I'm Doncaster.

51:41.550 --> 51:43.250
Jeremy Clarkson is from Doncaster.

51:43.250 --> 51:44.420
He is from Doncaster.

51:44.420 --> 51:46.820
In fact I know his mother very well.

51:46.820 --> 51:49.400
- Do you? - I knew him. When he was in school.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.570
So you like him?

51:50.570 --> 51:52.400
I wouldn't say I like him...Well.

51:54.750 --> 51:56.550
We were ready to plough.

51:57.450 --> 51:58.170
Here we go.

51:58.170 --> 52:01.170
3, 2, 1, go!

52:04.620 --> 52:05.900
I'm ploughing.

52:05.900 --> 52:07.050
Here we go!

52:09.750 --> 52:13.220
Difflock one, difflock two,

52:13.220 --> 52:15.770
Oil to plough.

52:15.920 --> 52:19.120
This is gonna be the fastest piece of ploughing ever.

52:19.650 --> 52:22.650
That's No.2 plough...

52:22.650 --> 52:25.800
So I was struggling with my robot plough

52:27.470 --> 52:30.500
James was trundling along like Worzel Gummidge.

52:30.500 --> 52:35.170
and Jeremy was going like a bat with no sense of direction at all.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.120
Oh, yeah, this is easy now.

52:38.750 --> 52:40.950
The judges were not impressed.

52:40.950 --> 52:45.170
March for straightness, 0 to 10, a half?

52:45.170 --> 52:48.270
Still, at least I was doing better than James.

52:48.270 --> 52:49.450
What's he doing?

52:50.150 --> 52:53.601
May, You imbecile, you've got the entire earth

52:53.601 --> 52:56.120
stuck to the back of your plough.

53:00.170 --> 53:04.520
Meanwhile, Richard had finally set off in the starship and to plough.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.570
But the moment he tried to turn around, disaster.

53:09.550 --> 53:12.350
I've sheared a bolt. That's bad.

53:13.150 --> 53:15.470
You've done nothing.

53:15.470 --> 53:17.150
So, This is down to me.

53:17.150 --> 53:19.670
The sports tractor is the only one who can do this job.

53:19.670 --> 53:21.450
Seen the size of the bolts I've sheared?

53:21.450 --> 53:22.670
You've sheared the bolts?

53:22.670 --> 53:25.100
Oh...

53:25.100 --> 53:26.900
Bolt one.

53:28.670 --> 53:32.000
With James' tractor beached and Hammond's broken,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.820
mine was the only one still running.

53:35.820 --> 53:37.700
It's half past 1 in the afternoon,

53:37.700 --> 53:42.550
and I frankly can't see us getting this done in a week.

53:44.070 --> 53:47.550
If we were going to get our crop planted by the end of the day,

53:47.550 --> 53:50.850
I was going to have to break out my ingenuity

53:50.850 --> 53:57.100
and use a method of ploughing they certainly wouldn't think of on the archers...

53:57.470 --> 54:00.650
Fire in the hole.

54:04.000 --> 54:04.850
What?!

54:11.720 --> 54:14.150
Good! Ploughing done.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.415
With our farming back on schedule,

54:18.415 --> 54:20.500
we could afford to have a spot of lunch.

54:20.500 --> 54:24.570
and that sparked one of the great debates of the country side.

54:24.570 --> 54:27.100
Never mind that. What's in the ploughman's

54:27.100 --> 54:28.470
Cheese, it's always cheese.

54:28.470 --> 54:31.350
- It's Cheddar.
- Yes. Still, no, could be Stilton.

54:31.350 --> 54:34.470
No, you can't have... Oh, I can't stand ploughman's with ponsy cheese.

54:34.470 --> 54:36.670
How could you have called Stilton ponsy.

54:36.670 --> 54:38.820
They are the least ponsy cheese in the world.

54:38.820 --> 54:44.250
Stale bread, hard Chadder, and a pickle of some sort, that's all they'd have

54:44.250 --> 54:45.170
- Apple.
- Farm...

54:45.170 --> 54:46.350
Only in season.

54:46.350 --> 54:51.250
And the apple season coincides with the ploughing season you pillock.

54:51.250 --> 54:56.400
Pickled onions, Branston Pickle, an apple

54:56.400 --> 54:59.250
- Cheese, get all both sorts. I don't want to have a row with him.
- Chadder or Stilton...OK

54:59.250 --> 55:01.500
- Lettuce.
- No, lettuce

55:01.500 --> 55:03.141
Eventually we made a decision

55:03.141 --> 55:07.070
and Hammond was nominated to go off and buy our lunch.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.070
I haven't got a car, I can't.

55:08.070 --> 55:08.970
You have to use your tractor.

55:14.420 --> 55:18.500
Wait a minute. 14th's a bit of a sharp gear and it really goes!

55:21.920 --> 55:26.450
With Hammond's 24-ton runabout bearing down on the nearest village,

55:26.450 --> 55:28.770
James and I set about on our next job:

55:28.770 --> 55:32.220
cultivating, breaking up the ploughed soil.

55:32.220 --> 55:36.800
And this demanded some serious tractor customizing.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.550
I don't like the look of that sky.

55:38.850 --> 55:40.850
Not for cultivating.

55:41.770 --> 55:46.150
Meanwhile in the local village, Hammond was blending in nicely.

55:49.700 --> 55:52.600
Hello, it's a bit tight.

55:56.020 --> 56:00.950
Oh, got alarms going off. Sorry, sorry.

56:04.650 --> 56:08.700
James was as much use at cultivating as he had been at ploughing.

56:08.700 --> 56:10.450
James, what're you doing?

56:10.450 --> 56:14.250
I'm doing my pre-cultivating checks, thank you, Jethro.

56:14.250 --> 56:17.250
I think this is the first thing we've ever filmed,

56:17.250 --> 56:20.220
while I can do it and those two can't.

56:29.270 --> 56:31.500
I've hit the telegraph pole.

56:31.500 --> 56:34.050
James, I'm begging you now to just

56:34.050 --> 56:37.370
drive the tractor into the field to do cultivating.

56:37.370 --> 56:40.970
Mercy, James, mercy, just for one...

56:41.800 --> 56:45.720
Right, two hydraulic tubes, top link attached.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
Come on, come down. One side of the fence or the other.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.570
Ploughman's lunch. Stilton or Chadder?

56:58.570 --> 56:59.700
Stilton.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.250
You see. James May you talking rubbish.

57:04.250 --> 57:08.170
Ploughman's lunch is ... Oh that's a bus.

57:09.950 --> 57:12.770
I sensed that the locals had had enough.

57:16.870 --> 57:20.970
But before I left town, I had to fill up with fuel.

57:23.700 --> 57:26.501
Back at the field, James finally joined me

57:26.501 --> 57:28.470
and together we finished the cultivating.

57:28.870 --> 57:31.570
Then we were ready to start planting the rape seed,

57:31.570 --> 57:36.670
but since one bag would be enough to do the whole 25 acres,

57:36.670 --> 57:39.220
only one of us could do it.

57:39.220 --> 57:43.870
And annoyingly, James insisted it had to be him.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.270
Bro, are we finished now?

57:50.270 --> 57:54.570
Err, 1127 pounds.

57:58.500 --> 58:01.825
And to add insult to poverty, when I got back,

58:01.825 --> 58:04.220
my ploughman's was snubbed.

58:04.850 --> 58:08.470
A crusty French loaf is what I asked for.

58:08.470 --> 58:10.170
That's a French apple as well.

58:10.170 --> 58:13.170
After lunch, is was time for the final job.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.900
The seeding machine was incredibly complicated,

58:15.900 --> 58:20.300
but James insisted that after 4 hours of pre-seeding checks

58:20.300 --> 58:21.950
he was up to the job.

58:21.950 --> 58:25.300
and we don't need that, because we got that. That's good.

58:26.050 --> 58:28.550
- James, do you know what you're doing?
- Yes.

58:28.550 --> 58:29.920
No, listen, stop.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.520
Stop, please, listen.

58:31.520 --> 58:34.900
You've got... Because slugs and pigeons are going to eat

58:34.900 --> 58:37.520
half all the seeds you plant,

58:37.520 --> 58:41.150
You've got to make sure that you plant 70, that's that many,

58:41.150 --> 58:43.970
- 70 per square yard.
- Right.

58:44.850 --> 58:46.600
This is it. The moment.

58:47.070 --> 58:50.070
Our petrol is going to be planted.

58:50.070 --> 58:51.920
Here we go. Seeding.

58:54.170 --> 58:56.820
Oh, for god's sake. James.

58:56.820 --> 58:58.070
Is that it?

58:58.070 --> 59:00.450
He's done the whole bloody lot.

59:00.450 --> 59:04.650
It's 25 acres, and they're in 25 square inches.

59:06.350 --> 59:08.870
May, you're gonna die!

59:08.870 --> 59:11.570
I'm gonna feed you into your own machine.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.000
You were useless in farming words

59:16.500 --> 59:18.670
He didn't understand seasons,

59:18.670 --> 59:21.020
he didn't understand cheese.

59:21.020 --> 59:24.450
And then all your seed fell on the fellow ground.

59:24.450 --> 59:25.800
I knew you were an onanist.

59:25.800 --> 59:29.000
Well, in fairness, they did make me go back

59:29.000 --> 59:30.800
and do all that again all through the night

59:30.800 --> 59:34.850
until my seed was evenly distributed in every furrow I can find.

59:36.670 --> 59:38.370
And next year, we are going to harvest that

59:38.370 --> 59:39.870
making it into delicious petrol.

59:39.870 --> 59:42.570
Absolutely. And then we'll be green and rich.

59:42.570 --> 59:43.870
But that's it for tonight.

59:43.870 --> 59:45.270
Thank you very much for watching.

59:45.270 --> 59:47.970
Next week, we make our own stretch limos which

59:47.970 --> 59:49.070
well doesn't go that well.

59:49.070 --> 59:51.550
But anyway, we'll see you then. Good night!
