00:01.384 --> 00:03.078
After a lifetime of searching,

00:03.079 --> 00:04.946
I've finally found
my perfect man.

00:04.947 --> 00:07.883
He's cute, fun,
and he loves to cuddle.

00:07.884 --> 00:10.686
He's a little young,
but we have so much in common.

00:10.687 --> 00:12.888
We watch all the same shows.

00:12.889 --> 00:15.324
Thanks for turning me
on to this show, Leo.

00:15.325 --> 00:16.591
I just
wish the mysteries

00:16.592 --> 00:18.193
weren't so hard.

00:18.194 --> 00:19.394
And when we go out,

00:19.395 --> 00:21.196
he always gets me
special treatment.

00:21.197 --> 00:23.165
Do you mi... thank you,
thank you.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.300
Here, take those.
You're such a nice guy.

00:25.301 --> 00:26.702
If... do you mind putting
this in the back.

00:26.703 --> 00:28.036
Would you? Thank you.

00:28.037 --> 00:29.938
But when we stay in,
that's when it gets

00:29.939 --> 00:31.073
real intimate.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.573
Do you like bath time?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.676
And he's really into my body,
especially my boobs.

00:34.677 --> 00:36.178
Hey, come on.

00:36.179 --> 00:37.679
Don't talk about
the kid like that.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.014
- It's gross.
- I'm sorry.

00:39.015 --> 00:41.450
I'm just...
I'm so obsessed with him.

00:41.451 --> 00:44.286
I didn't think it was possible
to love someone more than you,

00:44.287 --> 00:45.520
but then Leo came around,
and I was like,

00:45.521 --> 00:46.521
"Danny, who dat?"

00:46.522 --> 00:47.823
I know what you mean.

00:47.824 --> 00:49.791
I'm excited for you to
stop by work tomorrow.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.893
Be good for everyone to
get to know the little guy.

00:51.894 --> 00:53.395
It'd be good for
Leo's immune system

00:53.396 --> 00:54.529
to be around Morgan.

00:54.530 --> 00:58.100
Oh, I miss the old gang.
Tamra, Jeramery...

00:58.101 --> 01:00.268
- Jeremy.
- Hmm.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.738
My God, is maternity
leave over that soon?

01:02.739 --> 01:04.239
It went by so fast.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.074
You're not ready to go back yet?

01:06.075 --> 01:10.278
'Cause you don't have to go
back to work if you don't want.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.614
- Ever?
- Sure, why not?

01:12.615 --> 01:14.549
I don't know, Danny.
Be a stay-at-home mom?

01:14.550 --> 01:16.418
What would the stay-at-home
moms that I cyber-bully

01:16.419 --> 01:17.719
on Pinterest say?

01:17.720 --> 01:19.321
Look, I just think it's
gonna be a lot harder

01:19.322 --> 01:20.756
to go back than you think.

01:20.757 --> 01:22.891
Being a working mom
is really tough.

01:22.892 --> 01:24.393
I don't know.
According to movie posters,

01:24.394 --> 01:25.861
it's just like carrying
a briefcase and a baby bottle

01:25.862 --> 01:27.095
at the same time.

01:27.096 --> 01:28.997
Well, look, I just want
you and Leo to be happy.

01:28.998 --> 01:30.799
- That's it.
- Danny, I love working.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.734
I've always worked.
I didn't change

01:32.735 --> 01:35.737
just 'cause I had a kid.
I'll always make time for Leo,

01:35.738 --> 01:39.040
my sexy little boy-toy that...

01:39.041 --> 01:40.845
- Okay, I heard it then.
- Yeah.

Well, that's the trouble
with women like you.

02:42.038 --> 02:44.306
You confuse exploitation
with empowerment.

Are strip clubs empowering? No.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.677
Is Hooter's
restaurant empowering?

02:48.678 --> 02:49.845
I don't think so.

02:51.314 --> 02:53.815
two Georgia State cheerleaders
to wrestle in barbecue sauce,

02:53.816 --> 02:56.284
was that empowering?
It most certainly was not.

02:56.285 --> 02:58.153
It was fun, though.

02:58.154 --> 02:59.488
Those girls had a good time.

is doing any different?

- Yeah.

Okay, first of all, I do
think Hooters is empowering.

I've been there several
times and had a great meal.

06:33.836 --> 06:36.805
And yeah, I just, I don't...
I don't think

06:36.806 --> 06:40.241

is the right answer.

06:40.242 --> 06:41.710
- What?
- "It's not the answer,"

06:41.711 --> 06:42.911
- is what I said.
- No.

- No, obviously.
- You know what Danny said?

Yeah, but,
you're all about work.

and Colette Kimball-Kinney.

07:32.128 --> 07:33.607

07:34.943 --> 07:36.477
Yeah, when you told me
about Jody and Colette

07:36.478 --> 07:37.811
from Georgia,
I thought they were

07:37.812 --> 07:39.680
an older black couple,
whose love has seen them

07:39.681 --> 07:40.981
through America's most
turbulent decades.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.383
Not this jerk.

Hey, I'm Colette.
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

a historically black hair salon.

07:48.556 --> 07:50.224
- Yeah.
- Okay, I took her.

07:50.225 --> 07:52.459
I didn't really want to,
but she's such a good listener.

You, on the other hand,

07:53.461 --> 07:56.163

Hey, man, guess what?

08:04.039 --> 08:05.673
The picnic table called,

08:05.674 --> 08:06.807
they want their tablecloth back.

08:06.808 --> 08:08.242
Up here.

08:08.243 --> 08:10.377
Um, Jeremy,
why did you hire these clown?

08:10.378 --> 08:11.612
Look, Mindy, I'm sorry

08:11.613 --> 08:12.947
that you've gotten
off on the wrong foot,

08:12.948 --> 08:14.982
but I've know these
two since I was a boy.

08:14.983 --> 08:17.217
As a foreign exchange student,
I stayed with their family

08:17.218 --> 08:18.552
in Georgia.

08:18.553 --> 08:20.187
We had us some adventures,
didn't we?

08:20.188 --> 08:22.823
Yes, I was quite the rebel.
I ate a hushpuppy,

08:22.824 --> 08:26.160
I used paper napkins,
walked barefoot in grass...

08:26.161 --> 08:27.328
- Mm-hmm.
- Got a flatworm.

08:27.329 --> 08:28.862
- No big deal.
- And every afternoon,

08:28.863 --> 08:30.831
we'd wrestle till supper.
Come on.

08:30.832 --> 08:32.066
- Aah, don't.
- They're doing it.

08:32.067 --> 08:34.501
Cowards forfeit!
Cowards forfeit!

08:34.501 --> 08:36.003
It was a golden time.

08:36.004 --> 08:37.671
And, uh, when we told
Jeremy we were looking

08:37.672 --> 08:39.139
to move to New York,
he was kind enough

08:39.140 --> 08:40.441
to fix us up with a job.

08:40.442 --> 08:42.142
Ah, being a nurse in New York

08:42.143 --> 08:43.610
is cake compared to the South.

08:43.611 --> 08:44.979
Way less diabetes,

08:44.980 --> 08:48.582
and you never have to cut
anyone out of their house.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.918
Plus, I love my new co-workers.

08:50.919 --> 08:54.722
These two really brought this
whole office together, Dr. L.

08:55.924 --> 08:57.391
Oh, on the other hand,
the pace of a city doctor

08:57.392 --> 08:59.493
is nowhere near as languid.
If you'll excuse me,

08:59.494 --> 09:01.228
Mrs. Morrison just
went into labor.

09:01.229 --> 09:03.430
Wait, Mrs. Morison?
That's my patient.

09:03.431 --> 09:06.000
- You have a pleasant afternoon.
- You too, Jody.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.101
- Bye, Colette.
- I'm sorry.

09:07.102 --> 09:08.369
Don't talk to me
like I don't know

09:08.370 --> 09:11.805
who Mrs. Morrison is.
I invented Mrs. Morrison.

09:11.806 --> 09:14.108
Hey, guys. What happened?

09:14.109 --> 09:15.209
I ain't working
with no hillbillies.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.410
We gotta figure something out.

09:16.411 --> 09:18.879
Listen, I will kill
anyone you ask me to,

09:18.880 --> 09:22.880
but I think I might be team
Colette and Jody on that one.

09:23.451 --> 09:24.785
- I can't.
- Mindy.

09:24.786 --> 09:25.919
What's going on?

09:25.920 --> 09:27.888
Danny,
I can not work with that guy.

09:27.889 --> 09:30.457
He is the antithesis of
everything that I stand for.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.926
The freedom to hate-watch
strangers' wedding videos?

09:32.927 --> 09:35.562
No, like,
women's rights or whatever.

09:35.563 --> 09:38.465
Well, there is one way you
wouldn't have to deal with Jody.

09:38.466 --> 09:39.466
Yeah, frame him for murder,

09:39.467 --> 09:41.101
but where would
we find the body?

09:41.102 --> 09:42.469
The morgue. You're right.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.304
- I call Justin.
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

09:44.305 --> 09:46.140
I'm talking about
if you stayed home.

09:46.141 --> 09:49.076
I mean, you wouldn't have to
work with Jody or anybody.

09:49.077 --> 09:51.578
Danny, there's no way
that I'm staying home now.

09:51.579 --> 09:52.846
I mean, Jody would love that.

09:52.847 --> 09:54.081
I don't know. Is it smart

09:54.082 --> 09:56.817
to make such a big decision
based purely out of spite?

09:56.818 --> 09:58.819
That's why I do everything.
The only reason I became

09:58.820 --> 10:00.387
a doctor is because
my bitch guidance counselor

10:00.388 --> 10:01.955
told me I couldn't.
Miss Parsons.

10:01.956 --> 10:03.891
Look, I'm not crazy
about Jody either.

10:03.892 --> 10:06.260
He talks really slow.
He hates New York.

10:06.261 --> 10:08.362
He keeps calling me "Biscuit."

10:08.363 --> 10:10.030
Well, what should I do?

10:10.031 --> 10:11.465
Well, you need to
weigh all your options.

10:11.466 --> 10:13.534
I mean, you were happy
and calm yesterday,

10:13.535 --> 10:15.302
now only a couple
hours back at work,

10:15.303 --> 10:16.603
and you're so stressed out,
you can't stop

10:16.604 --> 10:18.105
clenching your fists.

10:18.106 --> 10:20.741
Okay, one, that's not true.
Two, I'm calm as hell...

10:23.311 --> 10:26.046
Crap.

10:26.047 --> 10:28.215
Okay, fine. Yes, I am stressed,

10:28.216 --> 10:29.950
but I'm stressed
because of Jody,

10:29.951 --> 10:30.984
not 'cause of work.

10:30.985 --> 10:32.820
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

10:32.821 --> 10:34.154
He's a great doctor.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.457
Unless he gives Jeremy
a reason to fire him,

10:36.458 --> 10:39.693
Jody isn't going anywhere.

10:39.694 --> 10:42.162
So he just has to
make one mistake.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.398
Can you plot to yourself?
We're still not married.

10:44.399 --> 10:45.699
I'd have to testify against you.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.401
Yes, sorry, sorry.

10:47.402 --> 10:49.736
So he just has to
make one mistake.

10:49.737 --> 10:52.240
You're still doing it.

10:53.641 --> 10:55.909
Hey, what ever happened with
the push present, Dr. C?

10:55.910 --> 10:58.545
Ugh, don't worry about it.
I took care of it.

10:58.546 --> 11:01.448
I just Googled "perfect
gifts for mom."

11:01.449 --> 11:02.850
- Oh, no.
- Yeah,

11:02.851 --> 11:05.819
I got her a luxurious
cranberry turtleneck.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.055
I left it for her
as a surprise this morning.

11:08.056 --> 11:09.923
Oh, boy.

11:09.924 --> 11:11.959
Do you mean "oh, boy," like,
in an excited way?

11:11.960 --> 11:13.560
Because
your inflection was way off.

11:13.561 --> 11:15.462
A turtleneck is, like,
what you get your aunt

11:15.463 --> 11:17.631
when she graduates from
court reporter school.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.800
Aw, you're crazy.
If you saw the garment,

11:19.801 --> 11:22.035
you'd understand.
The one I gave her

11:22.036 --> 11:25.639
is a cable-knit, merino wool,
cranberry turtleneck.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.974
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, I'm sorry.

11:26.975 --> 11:29.576
Did you say you got Dr. L
a cranberry turtleneck?

11:29.577 --> 11:31.111
That's crazy. Dr. L gave me

11:31.112 --> 11:32.646
this cranberry turtleneck today.

11:32.647 --> 11:34.448
What... what are the chances?

11:34.449 --> 11:35.749
She gave that to you?

11:35.750 --> 11:37.551
Yeah, I dropped off her
dry-cleaning this morning,

11:37.552 --> 11:39.486
and she said,
"Here, this is trash

11:39.487 --> 11:41.288
that someone left on
my bed as a prank."

11:41.289 --> 11:44.258
So... win-win.

11:44.259 --> 11:45.993
Well,
it obviously looks bad

11:45.994 --> 11:46.994
on Morgan.

11:46.995 --> 11:48.795
What does? My haircut.

11:48.796 --> 11:49.930
I know. I know, okay.

11:49.931 --> 11:53.066
I fell asleep in a fan.
Everyone happy now?

11:53.067 --> 11:54.635
I knew they'd notice.

11:54.636 --> 11:56.270
Push present?

11:56.271 --> 11:58.438
More like, based on
the novel "Push" by Sapphire

11:58.439 --> 12:01.108
in that these gifts are
an endless series of tragedies.

12:01.109 --> 12:02.976
You're really not good at this.

12:02.977 --> 12:04.411
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

12:04.412 --> 12:07.080
I mean, no dance, no sweater.

12:07.081 --> 12:09.316
- What about a bread maker?
- Oh, fine.

12:09.317 --> 12:10.984
I'll help you find a present.

12:10.985 --> 12:13.854
- Meet me in the sewers at dawn.
- No.

12:13.855 --> 12:15.889
I'm taking him to
the jewelry store.

12:15.890 --> 12:18.759
Okay.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.894
All right, Jody,
you're going down,

12:20.895 --> 12:24.097
and that's coming from
the queen of going down.

12:24.098 --> 12:25.766
Okay, Leo,
we're gonna find out the dirt

12:25.767 --> 12:27.768
on Jody,
and you are the lookout.

12:27.769 --> 12:30.003
Cool? Okay.

12:33.041 --> 12:37.041
♪ ♪

12:42.617 --> 12:44.318
- Hey!
- Oh, God!

12:44.319 --> 12:48.155
- Oh, uh, hey, Jody's sister.
- Hey.

12:48.156 --> 12:49.590
I was just looking
for your brother.

12:49.591 --> 12:53.026
He said he had an old book
he... he wanted to give me.

12:53.027 --> 12:54.328
- Oh.
- So, I was just looking

12:54.329 --> 12:55.996
through all of these.

12:55.997 --> 12:59.833
Hey, are you okay?

12:59.834 --> 13:02.569
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm...

13:02.570 --> 13:05.639
I'm just allergic
to the big city.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.441
Hey, man, I hate it here.

13:07.442 --> 13:09.443
Oh, God,
did a pigeon steal your pretzel?

13:09.444 --> 13:12.079
- You always have to buy two.
- No.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.514
This place is just
so different from our town.

13:14.515 --> 13:16.183
Back there,
I had so many friends.

13:16.184 --> 13:18.986
I was head cheerleader and
captain of the football team.

13:18.987 --> 13:21.622
- Well, why did you leave?
- Jody wanted to,

13:21.623 --> 13:23.690
and we do everything together.

13:23.691 --> 13:25.492
At least we did,
until an Uber driver

13:25.493 --> 13:27.394
ran over our tandem bicycle.

13:27.395 --> 13:30.097
God, this city sucks.

13:30.098 --> 13:31.898
Hey, it doesn't suck.

13:31.899 --> 13:33.900
It just takes some
getting used to.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.702
When I first moved here,
I was so lonely,

13:35.703 --> 13:38.105
I started dating
a statue in Central Park.

13:38.106 --> 13:39.706
- Oh.
- But, eventually,

13:39.707 --> 13:42.476
I made human friends,
and so will you.

13:42.477 --> 13:44.044
I mean, look, you already
made friends with me,

13:44.045 --> 13:45.679
and I think Leo thinks
you're pretty cool.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.848
He's... he's pretty cool too.

13:47.849 --> 13:49.716
All right.

13:49.717 --> 13:51.585
That's awesome.
My first New York friends.

13:51.586 --> 13:53.153
Let's body-five
and make it official.

13:53.154 --> 13:54.588
- Come on.
- You know,

13:54.589 --> 13:56.790
in New York City,
we don't body-five.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.459
- We give quick, courteous hugs.
- Oh.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.062
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

14:02.063 --> 14:04.464
- Oh, that was nice.
- Has the same impact

14:04.465 --> 14:05.766
- as a body-five, right?
- Yeah.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.734
Oh, and, uh,
my brother actually went home.

14:07.735 --> 14:10.037
He just finished up
Mrs. Morrison's delivery.

14:10.038 --> 14:12.806
It sounded like it was
pretty difficult, so...

14:12.807 --> 14:15.576
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

14:16.811 --> 14:18.845
Hey, Mrs. Morrison,
I had to come and see you

14:18.846 --> 14:21.581
because I heard that you
had such a hard delivery.

14:21.582 --> 14:23.050
Yeah, it was the hardest thing

14:23.051 --> 14:24.518
I've ever had to do in my life.

14:24.519 --> 14:28.055
You want to just maybe tell me
everything that Dr. K did wrong?

14:28.056 --> 14:30.557
Um, this will be recorded
for quality assurance.

14:30.558 --> 14:32.459
No, he didn't do anything wrong.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.294
Okay. Sure, not medically,

14:34.295 --> 14:36.663
but, kinda creeped you out,
right?

14:36.664 --> 14:38.131
He was, like,
a little inappropriate,

14:38.132 --> 14:40.400
little handsy with the nurses.

14:40.401 --> 14:41.735
No, that's what you do.

14:41.736 --> 14:44.471
Actually,
Dr. K was a perfect gentleman.

14:44.472 --> 14:46.173
Perfect gentleman?
You want to tell me

14:46.174 --> 14:47.474
that guy was
a perfect gentleman?

14:47.475 --> 14:49.176
Okay. So, you were saying,

14:49.177 --> 14:52.612
you had a repressed memory
about Dr. K molesting you.

14:52.613 --> 14:54.815
I loved Dr. K,
and my husband loved

14:54.816 --> 14:56.149
how old-fashioned he was.

14:56.150 --> 14:58.352
When Bob came in the room
after the birth was over,

14:58.353 --> 15:00.854
the doctor handed him
a cigar and a savings bond

15:00.855 --> 15:02.689
for the baby. How cute is that?

15:02.690 --> 15:04.191
Yeah, well, we're not really
supposed to give gifts

15:04.192 --> 15:05.559
like that, so that was,
like, weird, but...

15:05.560 --> 15:09.229
great to see you.

15:09.230 --> 15:13.200
Wait, so your husband wasn't
there when you gave birth?

15:13.201 --> 15:17.504
Yeah, Dr. K thought that that
way my vagina could remain

15:17.505 --> 15:19.906
a beautiful mystery
for my husband.

15:19.907 --> 15:21.308
What?

15:21.309 --> 15:23.944
Your vagina is not
supposed to be a mystery.

15:23.945 --> 15:26.413
That is so sexist...

15:26.414 --> 15:29.149
and kinda fireable.

15:29.150 --> 15:32.152
- Come here, you.
- Okay, okay.

15:32.153 --> 15:35.422
We talked about the kissing,
Dr. L.

15:35.423 --> 15:37.824
How about this ring with
the diamond baby on it?

15:37.825 --> 15:39.059
I don't know.

15:39.060 --> 15:41.094
Ooh, you can get her
a necklace that says,

15:41.095 --> 15:43.397
"100% Mom Realness" in jewels.

15:43.398 --> 15:45.232
- Yeah, nah.
- Okay.

15:45.233 --> 15:46.800
Well, you're not allowed
to cheap out on this

15:46.801 --> 15:48.635
like you did on my birthday.

15:48.636 --> 15:50.737
No Yogurtland gift card for $15.

15:50.738 --> 15:53.006
What about this?

15:53.007 --> 15:54.708
Those are amazing.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.042
Yeah.

15:56.043 --> 15:57.444
What did you do,
you son of a bitch?

15:57.445 --> 15:58.879
- Did you cheat on her?
- No.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.581
No, look, I want to get
Mindy something good

16:01.582 --> 16:03.483
because I love her.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.818
You're lying.

16:04.819 --> 16:06.520
Oh, my God, it's Beverly.

16:06.521 --> 16:08.288
I knew it.
You guys are the same age.

16:08.289 --> 16:09.389
What? No.

16:09.390 --> 16:11.391
Look, I want Mindy to
stay home with Leo,

16:11.392 --> 16:13.460
so I thought if I bought
her something nice,

16:13.461 --> 16:15.028
it might help convince her.

16:15.029 --> 16:16.630
You're trying to
buy Dr. L's freedom?

16:16.631 --> 16:18.231
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:18.232 --> 16:21.234
Well, she love being a mom,
and work stresses her out,

16:21.235 --> 16:22.803
and I make enough money
for the both of us.

16:22.804 --> 16:25.105
So what? Jay-Z's so rich,

16:25.106 --> 16:26.873
he throws his car out
when it runs out of gas,

16:26.874 --> 16:28.675
and he doesn't stop
his wife from working.

16:28.676 --> 16:30.110
If you want to
give Dr. L a gift,

16:30.111 --> 16:31.611
don't tell her to quit her job.

16:31.612 --> 16:33.246
She's already bled
and sacrificed for you,

16:33.247 --> 16:36.049
what have you
sacrificed for her, huh?

16:36.050 --> 16:38.518
I don't know.
That's a good question.

16:38.519 --> 16:39.820
I never thought about that.

16:39.821 --> 16:42.022
Now buy me that ring with
the diamond baby on it.

16:42.023 --> 16:43.824
I'm furious at you right now.

16:43.825 --> 16:47.027
Excuse me,
I need some help with this ring.

16:47.028 --> 16:49.095
I see your point about
the new speculums,

16:49.096 --> 16:50.630
- but if... if I may...
- Jeremy, Jeremy.

16:50.631 --> 16:51.932
- You should fire this guy.
- What?

16:51.933 --> 16:54.067
He told my patient that her
husband should not be there

16:54.068 --> 16:57.437
for the birth of her baby,
because it was "unladylike."

16:57.438 --> 16:59.206
- He's such a sexist.
- Please, Mindy,

16:59.207 --> 17:00.974
- Jody is not a sexist.
- Oh, yes.

17:00.975 --> 17:02.943
- I most certainly am a sexist.
- What?

17:02.944 --> 17:04.544
- See? See?
- Hey, man, let me explain.

17:07.114 --> 17:09.049
Now what is the definition
of the word sexist?

17:09.050 --> 17:11.017
Is it that I believe there
are traditional differences

17:11.018 --> 17:13.319
- between men and women?
- Yes.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.121
Well, if anyone should be
offended by that comparison,

17:15.122 --> 17:16.323
it's men.

17:16.324 --> 17:19.859
We all know that men are dirty,
disgusting rascals.

17:19.861 --> 17:21.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, they are.

17:21.395 --> 17:23.063
Why, when I was a boy,
I pulled a frog

17:23.064 --> 17:25.332
out of the creek,
and I lit it up with dynamite.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.400
- Ugh, typical.
- He had to go to a therapist

17:27.401 --> 17:28.735
for that.

17:28.736 --> 17:31.238
Whereas my sweet Colette
found an orphan skunk pup

17:31.239 --> 17:32.272
and raised it as her own,

17:32.273 --> 17:34.808
so sweet was her
feminine disposition.

17:34.809 --> 17:36.109
Jody blew him up, too.

17:36.110 --> 17:38.645
Had to go
back to the therapist.

17:38.646 --> 17:41.014
Now, this woman
think I detest women,

17:41.015 --> 17:42.749
yet I've devoted
my life to the study

17:42.750 --> 17:45.452
of the feminine biology.
That's how much I cherish them.

17:45.453 --> 17:46.653
- Yep.
- That's sweet.

17:46.654 --> 17:47.888
- Yeah.
- Now, the scriptures would

17:47.889 --> 17:50.657
have us believe that Eve
was the source of all sin.

17:50.658 --> 17:52.058
Well, I hope
the Lord will forgive me

17:52.059 --> 17:53.360
if I beg to differ.

17:53.361 --> 17:55.495
For was not the serpent a man?

17:57.231 --> 17:58.732
- Technically, yeah.
- What?

17:58.733 --> 18:00.200
That got applause?

18:00.201 --> 18:02.602
Are you out of your minds?
Even Harper Lee's health aide

18:02.603 --> 18:04.871
- wouldn't publish that.
- I think I'm sexist.

18:04.872 --> 18:06.940
- I'm sexist.
- Do racism next.

18:06.941 --> 18:08.775
G-g... I can't believe you guys.
All right.

18:08.776 --> 18:10.310
You either fire him,
or I'm gone.

18:10.311 --> 18:11.845
Okay, Mindy, come on.

18:11.846 --> 18:13.380
Well, maybe
that would be for the best.

18:13.381 --> 18:14.681
Hey!

18:14.682 --> 18:16.516
Dude, you shouldn't
have said that.

18:16.517 --> 18:18.051
Oh, you would love that,
wouldn't you?

18:18.052 --> 18:19.986
You would love it if
I packed up my bags,

18:19.987 --> 18:21.788
went home, took care of my baby,

18:21.789 --> 18:23.723
and hit out, 'cause you think
I should be more demure.

18:23.724 --> 18:25.258
You think I should
be more ladylike.

18:25.259 --> 18:27.627
Want to see ladylike?
How's this for ladylike?

18:27.628 --> 18:28.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:28.796 --> 18:30.063
- Oh, God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:30.064 --> 18:31.398
- Oh, God.
- What are you doing?

18:31.399 --> 18:32.832
I meant to flash him.
I didn't mean to spray milk

18:32.833 --> 18:34.434
in his face.

18:34.435 --> 18:36.235
- Calm... sorry.
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

18:41.042 --> 18:42.208
There, there, old friend.

18:42.209 --> 18:43.476
- I've got it all.
- It's gonna be okay.

18:43.477 --> 18:44.744
Okay, it... breast milk is
the most nutritious substance

18:44.745 --> 18:46.746
in the whole world.
I mean, at a spa,

18:46.747 --> 18:48.882
that would probably cost,
like, $200, that treatment.

18:48.883 --> 18:50.450
Mindy,
I think you should apologize

18:50.451 --> 18:51.751
to Jody right now.

18:51.752 --> 18:54.454
- An apology, at last?
- Mm-hmm.

18:54.455 --> 18:58.158
Well, let me get my slippers,
make myself comfortable.

18:58.159 --> 19:01.661
You know, don't bother. I quit.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.064
You quit, and I kill myself.

19:04.065 --> 19:05.732
Okay, sit down, sit down.

19:05.733 --> 19:09.769
Hey, Min, you don't really
want to quit, do you?

19:09.770 --> 19:11.171
I think I do, Danny.

19:11.172 --> 19:12.272
I don't fit in here anymore,

19:12.273 --> 19:14.674
and I don't even
know if I want to.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.243
And honestly,
there's someone at home who

19:17.244 --> 19:21.314
loves it when I squirt
breast milk in his face.

19:21.315 --> 19:24.918
I'd rather be with him.

19:24.919 --> 19:27.420
So, thank you, Jody, for making
this so much easier for me.

19:27.421 --> 19:29.322
Danny, I will see you at home,

19:29.323 --> 19:33.693
when you finish your work
day with these penis-brains.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.530
I'm sorry.
We're not penis-brains.

19:37.665 --> 19:38.832
Hey, Dr. L!

19:38.833 --> 19:40.166
Wait up.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.468
Oh, God.

19:41.469 --> 19:43.236
Is my skirt tucked into
my underwear again?

19:43.237 --> 19:45.171
Every time I think
I make a cool exit.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.706
No, no. Your underwear's fine.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.742
I wanted to apologize
for my brother.

19:48.743 --> 19:51.311
He's having a hard time
adjusting to New York

19:51.312 --> 19:53.279
like I am.
He still says hey to everybody

19:53.280 --> 19:54.581
that he walks by. It's New York.

19:54.582 --> 19:56.116
There's like a million people.

19:56.117 --> 19:58.585
He was three hours
late to work yesterday.

19:58.586 --> 20:00.253
Okay, well,

20:00.254 --> 20:02.255
it's not 100% his fault.

20:02.256 --> 20:04.624
I've been agonizing over
whether or not I should

20:04.625 --> 20:06.693
come back to work at all.

20:06.694 --> 20:08.261
It's been making
me a little crazy.

20:08.262 --> 20:11.264
Listen, if you're gonna quit,
fine, but don't do it

20:11.265 --> 20:13.233
because my brother
got under your skin

20:13.234 --> 20:15.135
'cause you got
under his skin too.

20:15.136 --> 20:17.337
The only time I hear him
speechifying things like that

20:17.338 --> 20:19.139
is when he feels threatened.
Like when they said

20:19.140 --> 20:21.274
they were gonna
cancel "Duck Dynasty."

20:21.275 --> 20:22.942
I love those boys.

20:22.943 --> 20:24.210
I would have freaked out too.

20:24.211 --> 20:26.112
"Duck Dynasty" not withstanding,
I can't believe

20:26.113 --> 20:28.114
that he was threatened by me.

20:28.115 --> 20:30.517
Yeah, and for what it's worth,

20:30.518 --> 20:32.052
I think you seem pretty cool,

20:32.053 --> 20:35.355
and I want you to stay.

20:35.356 --> 20:36.456
Yeah.

20:36.457 --> 20:38.458
Aw, Colette,

20:38.459 --> 20:39.559
I think you're great.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.760
Thanks.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.296
And if this were just
a little different,

20:43.297 --> 20:45.732
and, I don't know,
we were on vacation together,

20:45.733 --> 20:47.000
- like...
- Pfft. What?

20:47.001 --> 20:48.935
No, I'm not hitting on you.

20:48.936 --> 20:50.103
Geez.

20:50.104 --> 20:51.304
Well, I think we have
a great chemistry,

20:51.305 --> 20:52.305
but I... that's neither
here nor there.

20:52.306 --> 20:53.773
No, just make your own decision.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.542
- That's all I'm saying.
- Thanks for saying that.

20:55.543 --> 20:57.310
And who knows?
Maybe you'll see me here

20:57.311 --> 20:59.045
- back at work next week.
- Good.

20:59.046 --> 21:01.047
And as for this,
we'll just see where this goes.

21:01.048 --> 21:02.382
It's not going anywhere.

21:02.383 --> 21:04.250
- I don't know, maybe.
- Ah, not going anywhere.

21:08.355 --> 21:09.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:09.757 --> 21:12.192
Listen,
I think earlier I overreacted

21:12.193 --> 21:13.560
when I said
that I wanted to quit.

21:13.561 --> 21:14.961
I wasn't going to say anything,

21:14.962 --> 21:17.564
'cause Tamra said it was uncool.
It was a whole thing,

21:17.565 --> 21:21.434
but I am overjoyed
that you want to stay at home.

21:21.435 --> 21:23.103
- Yeah, but I-I cha...
- You're gonna be there

21:23.104 --> 21:26.106
for all the big moments,
and Leo's gonna feel so loved.

21:26.107 --> 21:27.574
And so secure because
he's gonna know

21:27.575 --> 21:29.175
that someone's always
at home with him.

21:29.176 --> 21:31.444
Babe, when I was growing up...

21:31.445 --> 21:34.080
I never had that,
and I'm just so happy

21:34.081 --> 21:36.716
that Leo will. Thank you.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.187
I'm so happy, too.

21:42.656 --> 21:45.992
I got you a little... just
a little push present.

21:45.993 --> 21:49.028
You know, you bled
and you... you suffered for me,

21:49.029 --> 21:53.032
and I felt like
it was only right

21:53.033 --> 21:56.102
if I did too.

21:57.638 --> 22:00.206
- Oh, my God, I love it.
- Yeah?

22:00.207 --> 22:02.175
Yeah.

22:02.176 --> 22:05.612
I cried when I got it,

22:05.613 --> 22:09.549
but not just because it hurt...
