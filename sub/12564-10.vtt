- I don't need a doctor, okay?

00:02.713 --> 00:06.215
What I do need is help flipping
my car back over.

00:06.217 --> 00:07.799
The young woman was driving
the vehicle

00:07.801 --> 00:10.302
and seems to have somehow
come out of it okay.

00:10.304 --> 00:11.786
Her father's on her way.

00:11.788 --> 00:14.556
No, he's, uh...
he's already here.

00:14.558 --> 00:16.842
This information together
with your eye symptoms

00:16.844 --> 00:20.062

a serious condition

00:20.064 --> 00:21.763
called sarcoidosis.

of pain pills.

00:38.699 --> 00:40.499
I could use a refill.
Of course.

00:40.501 --> 00:41.667
You shouldn't need
a refill yet.

00:41.669 --> 00:43.318
What are you implying?

00:43.320 --> 00:45.003
I'm... I'm uncomfortable
writing another prescription

00:45.005 --> 00:46.455

Nice to see
a friendly face here.

01:30.834 --> 01:32.634
Oh.

01:32.636 --> 01:34.303
A lot of paperwork.

01:34.305 --> 01:35.671
Yes.

01:35.673 --> 01:37.472
Yeah.

01:37.474 --> 01:39.174
You an oxy guy?

01:39.176 --> 01:42.144
You look like an oxy guy.

01:42.146 --> 01:43.228
Uh, no.

02:27.024 --> 02:30.359

and pick up some croissants?

02:30.361 --> 02:31.760
These aren't any good?

02:31.762 --> 02:33.261
No, they're good.

02:33.263 --> 02:35.480
Why settle for good when
you can have amazing though?

02:35.482 --> 02:37.065
I'll see what I can do.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.650
- But no promises.
- Mmhmm.

02:38.652 --> 02:40.769
The Van Der Gelts are
returning from Chiang Mai,

02:40.771 --> 02:42.988
and they need the Garuda
in their mansion.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.607
Between Hank's doctor-speak
and your art-speak,

02:45.609 --> 02:47.709
I have no idea
what anyone's saying anymore.

02:47.711 --> 02:49.127

02:49.129 --> 02:50.712
The Van Der Gelts
are important collectors.

02:50.714 --> 02:51.780
Okay.

02:51.782 --> 02:53.999
Chiang Mai is a city
in Thailand.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.834
The Garuda is
this huge sculpture they bought,

02:55.836 --> 02:59.287
and a mansion is
a big, fancy house.

02:59.289 --> 03:01.807
Thank you for that.

03:01.809 --> 03:04.509
So, uh, any weekend plans?

03:04.511 --> 03:06.561
No. Why?

03:06.563 --> 03:08.463
Don't do this.

03:08.465 --> 03:10.599
- Do what?
- Please don't do this.

I'm not telling you anything.

- So there are plans.
- I didn't say that.

03:24.665 --> 03:25.664
- You said it by not saying it.
- [Groans]

03:25.666 --> 03:27.482
That is all I am saying!

03:27.484 --> 03:28.617

- No!

03:28.619 --> 03:30.151
Yes! We're going someplace.
Where?

03:30.153 --> 03:31.486
Stop! Udo, can you please
tell him to stop?

03:31.488 --> 03:33.255
It's not my fault.
I'm just really good at it.

03:33.257 --> 03:34.790
I thought you might
like fresh coffee.

03:34.792 --> 03:37.342
- Cool.
- Thank you.

03:37.344 --> 03:40.295
You are impossible to surprise.

03:40.297 --> 03:42.597
- You're a peeker.
- What?

03:42.599 --> 03:44.850
Somebody who tries to see
through the wrapping paper.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.501
Okay, I am in no way a peeker.

03:46.503 --> 03:47.686
- Oh, please.
- Will that be all?

03:47.688 --> 03:49.387
- Yes.
- Thank you.

03:49.389 --> 03:52.808
Now, listen up, Mr. Peeker,
because this is all

03:52.810 --> 03:54.559
you're getting.
Okay.

03:54.561 --> 03:58.480
What I have planned might
seem like a little crazy,

03:58.482 --> 04:00.031
or too much,

04:00.033 --> 04:02.033
but if you fasten
your seat belt

04:02.035 --> 04:03.568
and go with it,

04:03.570 --> 04:07.205
I promise you're gonna
have an amazing time,

04:07.207 --> 04:10.459
as long as you don't mind
interrupting your campaign.

04:10.461 --> 04:11.743
And?

04:11.745 --> 04:12.711
And if you ask
any more questions,

04:12.713 --> 04:15.330
I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.

04:15.332 --> 04:17.798
- What if I have...
- Eh.

04:17.801 --> 04:19.801
- Come on...
- Nope.

04:19.803 --> 04:22.921
- Paige...

aren't making it very easy.

04:36.103 --> 04:37.352
Hey.

04:37.354 --> 04:38.820
When I got here,
you said, "nice pants."

04:38.822 --> 04:42.724
I'm sorry I misled you.

04:42.726 --> 04:45.160
So, last night
was the official end

04:45.162 --> 04:46.561
of my first trimester,

04:46.563 --> 04:48.396
and I emailed my mother.

04:48.398 --> 04:50.565
Ah, judging by your mood,
she took the news

04:50.567 --> 04:52.033
better than you thought.
No, no.

04:52.035 --> 04:54.402
I want to tell her
I'm pregnant face-to-face.

04:54.404 --> 04:55.871
But she's been in Europe
and isn't coming back

04:55.873 --> 04:57.205
until the end of the year.

04:57.207 --> 04:59.841
Ah, Rubina's still
"finding herself"?

04:59.843 --> 05:01.259
She was...

05:01.261 --> 05:05.096
Until she found
her new boyfriend Marcello.

05:05.098 --> 05:08.416
Can you believe it?
My mother has a boyfriend.

05:08.418 --> 05:10.886
And he's insisting
that I leave today

05:10.888 --> 05:12.387
to spend a long weekend
with them

05:12.389 --> 05:14.723
at his villa in Tuscany.

05:14.725 --> 05:16.090
He sent his jet.

05:16.092 --> 05:18.560
And it seats six,
so they extended the invitation

05:18.562 --> 05:20.645
to all of hankmed.

05:20.647 --> 05:22.447
That's an amazing offer.

05:22.449 --> 05:24.649
I wish I could accept,
but I just have too much work.

05:24.651 --> 05:26.484
Jeremiah said the same thing.

05:26.486 --> 05:28.269
- You should go though.
- Really?

05:28.271 --> 05:29.321
I mean, I have work too.

05:29.323 --> 05:30.605
Nah, I got you covered.

05:30.607 --> 05:31.606
Besides, you can't wait
to talk to your mom

05:31.608 --> 05:32.908

That's... that's crazy.

05:58.735 --> 05:59.851
But who am I to say no?

05:59.853 --> 06:02.437
I mean,
if it's what Paige wants.

06:02.439 --> 06:03.905
Oh, I haven't asked Paige yet.

06:03.907 --> 06:07.192
Oh, you haven't asked
Paige yet? I see.

06:07.194 --> 06:09.744
Does that mean
that I should invite her?

06:09.746 --> 06:12.914
- Well, of course you should.
- Great.

06:12.916 --> 06:16.701
So Hank and Jeremiah
can't come to Italy,

06:16.703 --> 06:19.337
and I should invite Paige.

06:19.339 --> 06:23.008

any more questions?

no. No.

didn't complain?

07:13.376 --> 07:15.677
I know he's a little stoic.

07:15.679 --> 07:18.680
Last night,
he was hosing off the deck,

07:18.682 --> 07:19.898
and he almost fainted.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.767

confidentiality rules,

if your friend has a name,

a boy or anything.

should I pack my linen suit

a little more formal?

18:29.069 --> 18:32.053
My brother Massimo.
He always spoils everything.

18:32.055 --> 18:33.071
[Whispers] Divya.

18:33.073 --> 18:35.274
Divya. Divs.
Hmm?

18:35.276 --> 18:37.159
What's going on?
What's the holdup?

18:37.161 --> 18:40.078
Apparently we need special
wine for a special toast.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.247
Ah,<i>perfetto.</i>

18:42.249 --> 18:43.949
Very good.

18:43.951 --> 18:46.118
Better get rid of this, right?

18:51.240 --> 18:52.240
Gah!

18:54.910 --> 18:55.910
Okay, you ready?

18:55.912 --> 18:57.596
All right. On three.
Yeah.

18:57.598 --> 18:59.715
One, two,

18:59.717 --> 19:00.716
three!

19:00.718 --> 19:02.934
[Both grunt]

19:02.936 --> 19:03.935
Got it, got it.

19:03.937 --> 19:05.470
Okay.
Easy, easy.

19:05.472 --> 19:07.255
Ah, good.
And she's out.

19:07.257 --> 19:09.858
[Pants]

19:09.860 --> 19:11.143
Y... You're okay, Molly?

19:11.145 --> 19:12.227
- Yeah.
- All right, baby.

19:12.229 --> 19:14.229
- Yeah.
- [Kisses]

19:16.316 --> 19:18.533
Don, can you apply pressure
to the wound right here?

19:18.535 --> 19:20.035
- Yeah.
- Just press.

19:20.037 --> 19:21.953
Okay.

19:21.955 --> 19:25.157
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

19:25.159 --> 19:27.492
I can still feel
a pulse in her leg.

19:27.494 --> 19:28.543
It's a good sign.

19:28.545 --> 19:29.828
- Thank you.
- It's good.

19:29.830 --> 19:30.945
It's good.

19:30.947 --> 19:32.998
Okay, Molly, can you feel this?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.333
Yeah.

19:34.335 --> 19:35.634
Okay, good.
Can you wiggle your toes?

19:35.636 --> 19:37.803
- Um, mm-hmm.
- Okay. Good.

19:37.805 --> 19:40.472
Gosh, she's still losing blood.

19:40.474 --> 19:43.124
Riverhead's
the closest hospital.

19:43.126 --> 19:46.094
Okay, I just need to wrap it
with a pressure dressing,

19:46.096 --> 19:47.479
and then we can go.

19:47.481 --> 19:49.631
There we go.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.800
You're gonna be okay, Molly.

19:51.802 --> 19:53.685
Okay, we should be able
to get a cell signal

19:53.687 --> 19:55.270
within a few Miles.
Yeah.

19:55.272 --> 19:56.521
All right.
Let's get moving.

19:56.523 --> 19:57.939
I got it, I got it.

19:57.941 --> 19:59.474
- Come on, baby. Ready?
- Mmhmm.

19:59.476 --> 20:01.243
Let's go.
One, two, three.

20:01.245 --> 20:04.196
All right, here we go.

20:04.198 --> 20:07.416
Now, while this is not really

20:07.418 --> 20:12.037
an official engagement party,

20:12.039 --> 20:14.539
you see, Rubina
would like our divorces

20:14.541 --> 20:16.375
to be finalized first.

20:16.377 --> 20:20.011
I believe this to be
an ancient hindu custom.

20:20.013 --> 20:21.263
[Laughter]

20:21.265 --> 20:23.382
But given Marcello's
catholic faith,

20:23.384 --> 20:25.517
divorce may never happen,

20:25.519 --> 20:27.269
so we may have to live in sin.

20:27.271 --> 20:28.470
Oh, that's not bad.

20:28.472 --> 20:30.355
[Glasses clink]
[Laughs] Cheers.

20:30.357 --> 20:32.691
Divya, I thought
you would like my surprise.

20:32.693 --> 20:34.810
Do you disapprove?

20:34.812 --> 20:36.528
Of course not.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.897
It's just that
your surprise is...

20:38.899 --> 20:40.449
It's so surprising.

20:40.451 --> 20:43.952
I'm happy that you're happy.

20:43.954 --> 20:46.905
Yes, but you did not
drink to us.

20:46.907 --> 20:49.124
Oh, oh, oh.
No, no.

20:49.126 --> 20:51.710
It's... it's not that.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.713
I can't drink.

20:54.715 --> 20:56.748
- Ah.
- I don't understand.

21:01.754 --> 21:06.224
Mummy, I have a surprise
of my own.

21:08.394 --> 21:10.211
I'm pregnant.

21:10.213 --> 21:11.763
[Chuckles]

21:11.765 --> 21:13.047
<i>Incinta.</i>

21:13.049 --> 21:14.215
[Murmuring]

21:14.217 --> 21:15.734
Cheers.

21:15.736 --> 21:18.069
But I thought...

21:19.605 --> 21:23.408
well, that is a surprise.

21:23.410 --> 21:25.744
Yes. It is.

21:25.746 --> 21:28.997
I'm sure you'll both be
wonderful parents.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.415
No, no, no, no.

21:30.417 --> 21:31.950
No, no, no.
I'm not the father.

21:31.952 --> 21:35.420
Mama, I had a fling.

21:35.422 --> 21:38.673
With a famous polo player
and underwear model.

21:38.675 --> 21:40.759
Same guy.

21:40.761 --> 21:42.210
I'm a little confused.

21:42.212 --> 21:43.628
That makes two of us.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.213
Can we talk for one second,
Divya. Just one second.

21:45.215 --> 21:48.216
One second.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.920
Why do I have a feeling

21:51.922 --> 21:53.188
you're about to make this
all about you?

21:53.190 --> 21:55.590
This isn't my birthday party,
is it?

21:55.592 --> 21:58.026
It's your birthday?

21:58.028 --> 21:59.528
Mmhmm.

21:59.530 --> 22:03.064
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

22:03.066 --> 22:04.699
Happy Birthday.

22:04.701 --> 22:06.485
Oh, thank you, thank you.

22:06.487 --> 22:09.704
But Evan, shouldn't you
be spending it with Paige?

22:09.706 --> 22:11.940
That's what I thought
I was doing, Divya.

22:11.942 --> 22:13.124
I thought this whole thing
was a plan

22:13.126 --> 22:14.543
she cooked up to surprise me.

22:14.545 --> 22:17.996
What? Why on earth
would you think that?

22:17.998 --> 22:20.114
'Cause it seemed awesome.

22:20.116 --> 22:22.300
No wonder you've been acting
especially insane.

22:22.302 --> 22:24.169
I have to get out of here.

22:24.171 --> 22:27.055
I have to get home.
I have to call Paige.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.924
No bars. Great.

22:28.926 --> 22:30.225
Come on.

22:30.227 --> 22:31.893
Bars.

22:31.895 --> 22:33.228
Give me bars.

22:33.230 --> 22:36.130
Give me bars.
Give me bars.

22:36.132 --> 22:37.232
Bars.

22:37.234 --> 22:39.267
I have no...

22:39.269 --> 22:40.268
I have bars.

22:40.270 --> 22:43.738
[Laughs] I have bars.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.740
Hi, this is Paige.
Please leave a message.

22:45.742 --> 22:47.192
Babe, I'm so sorry.

22:47.194 --> 22:49.194
I accidentally came
to Italy without you.

22:49.196 --> 22:50.579
I thought the whole thing...
[Beep beep]

22:50.581 --> 22:52.981
Was your pla...
hello? No.

22:52.983 --> 22:55.534
No bars. No bars.

22:55.536 --> 22:58.537
Just give me one bar.
Give me some cars.

22:58.539 --> 23:00.488
Please give me bars!

23:02.430 --> 23:03.847
Any service yet?

23:03.849 --> 23:05.732
We should get a signal
in about a mile.

23:05.734 --> 23:06.733
Okay.

23:06.735 --> 23:09.603
They just let it rot.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.022
Our house.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.574
Should she be so loopy?

23:13.576 --> 23:16.309
Well, the hydrocodone's
controlling her pain,

23:16.311 --> 23:18.829
but it will make her drowsy
and weak for a few hours.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.581
She might also have
some confusion

23:20.583 --> 23:22.282
and emotional lability.

23:22.284 --> 23:23.333
Lability?

23:23.335 --> 23:25.085
Mood swings.

23:25.087 --> 23:28.589
They bought it
only to demolish it.

23:28.591 --> 23:32.259
[Thumps]
They're horrible people!

23:32.261 --> 23:34.678
I hate them!

23:34.680 --> 23:36.430
Got it.

23:36.432 --> 23:39.349
[Cries] We should stop
the bulldozers.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.334
Please at least try.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.353
Honey, listen.
We both loved that house.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.555
We're just gonna have to
remember that...

23:44.557 --> 23:46.506
no, no.
We have to save it.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.891
Turn around.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Molly!

23:47.893 --> 23:50.894
- Molly!
Both: Molly!

23:50.896 --> 23:52.512
[Tires screech]

23:53.615 --> 23:54.615
Whoa!

23:54.617 --> 23:55.649
[Both groaning]

23:55.651 --> 23:57.117
Oh.

23:57.119 --> 23:59.403
Is everyone okay?
Molly, sweetheart, you okay?

23:59.405 --> 24:02.539
Yeah. I-I didn't mean to...

24:02.541 --> 24:04.524
I'm... I'm sorry.
Any pain?

24:04.526 --> 24:06.243
- No, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.628
Stay where you are.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.463
It's better to keep
your leg elevated.

24:12.383 --> 24:14.200
We'll need something
for traction.

24:14.202 --> 24:16.202
- Yeah.
- I'll go take a look.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.309
Ow.

24:22.311 --> 24:23.760
Ooh.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.012
Molly!

24:25.014 --> 24:26.880
No, it's... it's fine.
I'm okay.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.214
Can't you listen to Hank?

24:28.216 --> 24:31.235
It's fine.
It's gonna be elevated, okay?

24:31.237 --> 24:32.886
We're not sunk that deep.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.055
- I can push us out.
- No, I'll push. You steer.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.491
You've exerted yourself
too much already.

24:37.493 --> 24:40.777
There we go.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.112
Okay.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.248
All right, good.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.072
Okay, turn it over.
All right.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.074
[Engine turns over]

24:57.745 --> 24:59.963
[Grunts]

24:59.965 --> 25:01.965
Okay, easy, easy.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.800
All right.

25:03.802 --> 25:05.469
I put it into neutral.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.187
Let's do this together on three.
No, no, no.

25:07.189 --> 25:08.472
Don, you shouldn't be...
Come on.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.024
One, two, three.
All right.

25:11.026 --> 25:13.193
[Both grunt]

25:13.195 --> 25:14.311
Don?

25:14.313 --> 25:16.313
Don?

25:23.437 --> 25:25.656
Don? Don?

25:25.658 --> 25:27.324
What happened?

25:27.326 --> 25:29.576
Molly, I need you to try 911.

25:29.578 --> 25:30.777
911?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.714
What is it about "no service"

25:33.716 --> 25:36.466
that you guys don't understand.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.635
Dad?

25:38.637 --> 25:40.120
What's... what's going on?
What are you doing?

25:40.122 --> 25:41.972
What are you doi...
dad? Dad?

25:41.974 --> 25:43.957
Molly, just try to call now.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.976
He'll be okay,
but he needs our help, okay?

25:45.978 --> 25:47.477
Oh, God.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.230
No, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

25:50.232 --> 25:52.316
Uh, oh, no.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.900
Ah!
Oh, it's ringing.

25:53.902 --> 25:55.301
Hi, okay. Hi.

25:55.303 --> 25:58.772
Yes, there's a police officer
hurt on middle path

25:58.774 --> 26:00.691
east of Mattituck...

26:00.693 --> 26:01.908
tell them he needs
immediate assistance.

26:01.910 --> 26:04.161
It... it dropped.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.162
Well, did they hear you?

26:05.164 --> 26:06.613
I don't know!

26:06.615 --> 26:08.982
God, what's happening?

26:08.984 --> 26:11.001
Molly!
Molly, look at me right now.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.586
I need you to go in the trunk,

26:12.588 --> 26:14.087
and get my bag, okay?
Okay.

26:14.089 --> 26:15.756
Your dad just needs
some help breathing.

26:15.758 --> 26:18.091
When did he stop breathing?
Oh, my God.

26:18.093 --> 26:19.343
Oh, my God.

26:21.012 --> 26:23.180
What's... what is that for?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.716
I'm trying to start his heart.
Don't touch him.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.300
Oh, my God.
His heart stopped?

26:27.302 --> 26:29.269
What did... what did you do
to him?

26:29.271 --> 26:31.838
Okay, stand clear.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.974
[Electric zap]

26:33.976 --> 26:35.058
Ugh.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.059
No? Didn't...

26:36.061 --> 26:37.611
didn't work? No?

26:37.613 --> 26:39.279
Do... do it again!

26:39.281 --> 26:41.898
Not yet, I need to get
his circulation up first.

26:44.152 --> 26:47.854
Okay, let's just try
another shock, okay?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.373
Stand clear again, please.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.041
Stay with me, Molly.
Okay.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.693
Stay with me, okay.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.912
[Electric zap]

26:55.914 --> 26:58.131
Ah!
No, no.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.200
No, no. No, no, no.
Dad!

27:00.202 --> 27:02.636
No, don't die.
Come on. Come on.

27:02.638 --> 27:04.254
You can't die.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.423
This isn't working.
This isn't working.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.424
I have to intubate.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.541
Okay.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.211
Do it!
What are you waiting for?

27:11.213 --> 27:13.597
Well, the procedure's better
done in a hospital, but...

27:13.599 --> 27:15.215
All right,
I'm gonna try an LMA.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.566
That should give us
a more secure airway.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.219
Okay.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.887
Hurry!

27:20.889 --> 27:22.105
Hurry up!
Come on!

27:22.107 --> 27:23.389
Don't let him die.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.225
You said that you wouldn't
let him die!

27:25.227 --> 27:26.827
Molly, shh.
Just calm down, okay?

27:26.829 --> 27:28.578
I need to get this
into his throat.

27:28.580 --> 27:33.900
Now can you hold his head still
for me?

27:33.902 --> 27:36.420
Good.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.872
Okay.

27:38.874 --> 27:42.125
And here we go, don.

27:42.127 --> 27:44.077
[Don gagging]

27:44.079 --> 27:45.846
What's wrong?

27:45.848 --> 27:49.582
He may have aspirated a bit,
but... I'm in.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.085
- Okay.
- Okay. I need this.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.220
Oh, sorry.

27:57.642 --> 27:59.926
Is he getting air?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.595
He is now.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.699
I want to try one more time.

28:05.701 --> 28:07.784
Okay, stand clear.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.286
Come on, don.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.872
God.

28:11.874 --> 28:13.457
Okay.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.608
Sinus rhythm.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.160
[Cries]

28:17.162 --> 28:18.945
Yep, I'm getting a pulse.
His heart is working.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.915
[Crying] Oh, my God.

28:23.885 --> 28:25.252
Is he gonna wake up?

28:25.254 --> 28:27.120
He's out of V-fib,
he's getting oxygen.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.305
[Sirens wail]

28:28.307 --> 28:32.893
And it sounds
like your call went through.

28:35.906 --> 28:38.465
Divya, this was a mistake.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.200
No, we're taking a shortcut.

28:40.202 --> 28:42.969
This is not a...
this is a dirt road!

28:42.971 --> 28:43.987
Stop the car.
Stop.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.238
Pull over right now.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.240
Just pull over.

28:49.977 --> 28:52.328
Are you going to be sick again?

28:52.330 --> 28:54.497
No, I'm okay.

28:54.499 --> 28:57.617
No, I'm not.

29:00.704 --> 29:03.757
[Vomits]

29:11.999 --> 29:13.633
All better?

29:13.635 --> 29:16.936
Uhh...

29:16.938 --> 29:19.606
I think I have
the Toscana virus.

29:19.608 --> 29:21.340
Or I guess some kind of parasite

29:21.342 --> 29:23.176
from that raw pork carpaccio?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.895
It wasn't raw pork.
It was raw beef.

29:25.897 --> 29:27.513
Sorry.

29:27.515 --> 29:28.898
Wait

29:30.234 --> 29:31.618
[groans] Uhh...

29:31.620 --> 29:34.187
You are suffering
from too much stress

29:34.189 --> 29:35.538
and too much chianti.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.240
Don't... don't say that word,
please.

29:37.242 --> 29:39.709
Even the thought of wine...

29:39.711 --> 29:42.712
[exhales]

29:45.032 --> 29:46.332
Why won't she call back?

29:46.334 --> 29:48.918
Do you have a signal?

29:48.920 --> 29:51.805
I have one bar...
I have no bars.

29:51.807 --> 29:54.307
It's very weak.
We should keep driving.

29:54.309 --> 29:56.375
Come on.
[Phone chimes]

29:56.377 --> 29:57.594
It's her.
Oh, my God.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.895
Paige!

29:58.897 --> 30:00.980
Evan? What's wrong?

30:00.982 --> 30:03.566
[Groans]
Oh. It's a nightmare.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.218
I'm... I'm dying here.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.320
- Are you sick?
- Yes, I'm miserable.

30:07.322 --> 30:09.072
I drank too much.

30:09.074 --> 30:10.323
Poor you.

30:10.325 --> 30:12.892
No, Divya's taking care of me,
so...

30:12.894 --> 30:15.945
you called six times to tell
me you're drunk with Divya?

30:15.947 --> 30:17.396
No. No, of course not.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.898
Divya's pregnant.
She's not drinking.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.085
Evan, I've worked
all night, I...

30:22.087 --> 30:23.786
sorry, okay?
I'm so sorry.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.339
I made a terrible mistake.

30:26.341 --> 30:28.424
What mistake?

30:28.426 --> 30:29.742
- I thought that...
- What?

30:29.744 --> 30:32.712
[Static]
I thought... This... My surpr...

30:32.714 --> 30:34.597
what?
What do you mean, what?

30:34.599 --> 30:37.467
- What?
- I said I'm sorry.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.637
You don't sound sorry.
You sound annoyed.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.022
Look, why don't you call back

30:43.024 --> 30:44.257
when you have
a better connection?

30:44.259 --> 30:45.808
And you're sober.

30:45.810 --> 30:47.927
Paige, no, no, no.
I wasn't drink...

30:47.929 --> 30:49.095
Paige?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.948
[Whispers] Oh, my God.

30:58.939 --> 31:00.790
Henry, it's me.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.826
If you get this...

31:03.828 --> 31:06.412
I don't know, call.
I'm in Italy.

31:08.448 --> 31:10.800
Do you want to talk?

31:10.802 --> 31:14.587
Yeah,
but Hank's not picking up.

31:15.806 --> 31:19.592
You mean to you?

31:21.762 --> 31:24.564
No, it's fine.

31:24.566 --> 31:25.815
It will be fine.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.016
I just need to get home.

31:27.018 --> 31:30.970
Absolutely.
Let's go.

31:34.775 --> 31:36.526
[Car door closes]

31:37.778 --> 31:41.080
Okay.
[Engine sputters]

31:41.082 --> 31:43.449
[Sputtering]
What-

31:43.451 --> 31:45.985
you're kidding me.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.704
You're flooding it.
I'm not flooding it.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.373
Well, stop.
Okay, you're making it worse.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.507
I am not.

31:51.509 --> 31:52.875
Well,
you're not making it better!

31:52.877 --> 31:54.844
Well, neither are you,
you ninny!

31:54.846 --> 31:58.381
[Engine sputters]

32:02.102 --> 32:03.519
Sorry.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.504
I shouldn't be yelling at you.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.357
You're stressed,
you're not well.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.841
You called me a ninny.

32:08.843 --> 32:11.361
[Sighs]

32:11.363 --> 32:13.229
I'm stressed too.

32:13.231 --> 32:16.015
Why?
Why are you stressed?

32:16.017 --> 32:18.117
Your mom took the fact
you're having a baby so well.

32:18.119 --> 32:23.022
Yes, and all I have to do
is have a baby.

32:26.910 --> 32:30.997
Well, hold on a second.

32:30.999 --> 32:33.049
Are you worried
about being a mom?

32:33.051 --> 32:35.551
Of course not.

32:35.553 --> 32:37.337
A single woman having
her first child...

32:37.339 --> 32:39.722
what on earth do I have to be
worried about?

32:39.724 --> 32:41.841
I'm sorry, Divya.

32:41.843 --> 32:43.393
Ugh, I made this all about me.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.894
Um, okay.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.229
Do you want to talk about it?

32:46.231 --> 32:48.547
No. No, I just...
I want to fix this car

32:48.549 --> 32:51.267
and get you on that plane.
Right?

32:51.269 --> 32:54.270
Right.

32:54.272 --> 32:56.189
Okay, what's the diagnosis?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.724
No idea.

33:04.581 --> 33:06.366
[Exhales]

33:07.501 --> 33:09.619
How is it I can be

33:09.621 --> 33:12.588
in the most colossal
catastrophe ever,

33:12.590 --> 33:15.258
yet I'm less on edge
right now with you

33:15.260 --> 33:19.429
than I've been
all summer with...

33:19.431 --> 33:22.215
With Paige.

33:25.219 --> 33:30.023
I don't know, Evan.

33:30.025 --> 33:34.360
But I do know
that you thrive on drama.

33:34.362 --> 33:37.113
Excess, extremes.

33:37.115 --> 33:40.400
It's like good
is never good enough.

33:40.402 --> 33:45.822
You're married to a beautiful,
talented Saint of a woman.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.874
Your starter home is a castle.

33:47.876 --> 33:49.459
Relax and enjoy it.

33:49.461 --> 33:53.162
I know.
Look, everything should be good.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.914
Why is it so hard?

33:54.916 --> 33:58.835
It's like the two of us
are out of sync.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.586
Well, maybe...

34:00.588 --> 34:02.722
Maybe you expect
too much of her.

34:02.724 --> 34:06.592
What? I do not.

34:06.594 --> 34:08.293
Like what?

34:08.295 --> 34:10.263
Like a surprise party
in Tuscany?

34:10.264 --> 34:11.563
Where did that come from?

34:11.565 --> 34:13.599
Okay, no, no, no.
All right?

34:13.601 --> 34:15.735
She hinted and then you said...

34:15.737 --> 34:18.571
oh, Evan.

34:18.572 --> 34:21.824
It came from me.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.077
From my ninny skull.

34:24.079 --> 34:27.480
You have a need
for the grandiose.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.532
Right now I have
a need to get home

34:29.534 --> 34:31.451
and explain my mistake.

34:31.453 --> 34:33.286
I love Paige.
I love her so much.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.704
I would do anything for her.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.005
I'd do anything and everything!

34:36.007 --> 34:37.656
Well, nothing grandiose
about that.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.926
Yeah, see?

34:39.928 --> 34:42.011
Thank you.

34:43.297 --> 34:44.964
Yeah.

34:46.016 --> 34:48.167
Ooh.

34:48.168 --> 34:51.687
It's like we're out of sync.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.889
Why is it so hard?

34:53.891 --> 34:56.391
You're thinking
that sounds cliche.

34:56.393 --> 34:59.479
No, I'm thinking
the Van Der Gelts

34:59.481 --> 35:01.697
will never miss this Bordeaux.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.032
[Laughs]

35:03.034 --> 35:05.818
It is amazing.

35:07.321 --> 35:11.374
So what was
the real birthday plan?

35:11.376 --> 35:13.075
I was listening.

35:13.077 --> 35:14.527
A bit.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.829
Well, Evan and I
put ourselves on a budget,

35:16.831 --> 35:18.915
so I was thinking small.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.299
Of course it turns out

35:20.301 --> 35:21.884
he wanted
a private jet to Tuscany.

35:21.886 --> 35:23.219
Well, man are like that.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.087
They never tell you
what they want,

35:25.089 --> 35:28.758
then expect you
to read their minds.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.511
Of course, if you get it wrong,

35:31.513 --> 35:36.516
they get all emotional
and accuse you of not caring.

35:36.518 --> 35:38.651
Are you sure
you aren't thinking of women?

35:38.653 --> 35:40.553
Positive.
His name was Ralph.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.356
Ralph.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.057
Another time,
a different bottle.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.610
So your birthday plans
were small.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.779
But nostalgic.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.064
I read that the Jersey devil
on the boardwalk

35:52.066 --> 35:54.283
is shutting down.
The Jersey devil is-

35:54.285 --> 35:56.252
- a roller coaster
that scared Evan

35:56.254 --> 35:57.670
to death as a kid.

35:57.672 --> 36:00.456
So I booked it for a whole hour

36:00.458 --> 36:01.924
this afternoon.

36:01.926 --> 36:05.511
They even agreed to run it
a little slower if necessary

36:05.513 --> 36:07.746
so that Evan could get
that shot he always wanted.

36:07.748 --> 36:11.384
Hands up, fearless,
like all the other kids.

36:11.386 --> 36:15.555
That is so sweet.

36:15.557 --> 36:19.442
But it's not Tuscany.

36:19.444 --> 36:23.312
By the way,
my birthday is coming up.

36:23.314 --> 36:27.099
And I hear
they're shutting down Paris.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.461
Any of you kids speak English?

36:38.463 --> 36:41.130
Tell your father

36:41.132 --> 36:43.949
that we know that you're not
headed towards the airport,

36:43.951 --> 36:46.385
but if you could drop him off...

- His flight is in an hour.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.897
[Father indistinct] Okay!

38:21.899 --> 38:23.549
[Laughs]
[Father speaking italian]

38:23.551 --> 38:25.050
<i>Ciao,</i> Italy!

38:25.052 --> 38:26.402
Paige, here I come!

38:26.404 --> 38:28.354
[Pigs squealing]
Ow! No biting! Ow!

38:28.356 --> 38:29.905
No! Stop biting!

38:29.907 --> 38:32.158
They're biting me!
Ow!

38:32.160 --> 38:34.126
Stop biting me!

39:44.688 --> 39:47.540
So tell me, what plans have
you made for your baby?

39:47.542 --> 39:49.292
None.

39:49.294 --> 39:52.178
I keep meaning to, but
every time I think about it,

39:52.180 --> 39:54.096
that part of my brain
goes all fuzzy.

39:54.098 --> 39:56.966
That's pregnancy.

39:56.968 --> 39:59.385
Pundit-ji always tells me
to live in the present.

39:59.387 --> 40:01.354
But the only time I could

40:01.356 --> 40:03.339
was when I was pregnant,

40:03.341 --> 40:05.674
especially with you.

40:05.676 --> 40:07.193
Why with me?

40:07.195 --> 40:10.363
You were the second,
so I wasn't as nervous.

40:10.365 --> 40:13.015
But I think
it was also about you.

40:13.017 --> 40:15.851
From the start,
I knew you were changing me

40:15.853 --> 40:17.737
for the better.

40:17.739 --> 40:20.957
You know, if you'd
said that to me before,

40:20.959 --> 40:24.377
I would have thought
that you were crazy.

40:24.379 --> 40:27.463
But now, it makes sense.

40:27.465 --> 40:31.133
Whoever this is,

40:31.135 --> 40:35.371
this baby,
makes me feel so different,

40:35.373 --> 40:40.560
so challenged,
and yet strangely content.

40:40.562 --> 40:44.480
It's like I know a secret.

40:44.482 --> 40:48.684
A really good secret.

40:48.686 --> 40:51.187
You're going to be
a wonderful mother, Divya.

40:59.279 --> 41:01.614
So when do you think
he'll be off the vent?

41:01.616 --> 41:02.999
With any luck, tomorrow.

41:03.001 --> 41:06.068
Soon after that, conscious.

41:06.070 --> 41:07.587
Pretty amazing save
you made, Dr. Lawson.

41:07.589 --> 41:09.338
Oh. Thanks.
I got lucky.

41:09.340 --> 41:13.042
- Get some rest.
- Will do.

41:34.031 --> 41:36.265
You're even working your magic
out on the north fork.

41:36.267 --> 41:38.367
No magic.
Just medicine.

41:38.369 --> 41:40.870
Molly's pretty upset.

41:40.872 --> 41:43.039
Yeah, well, it was
a pretty serious situation

41:43.041 --> 41:44.290
out there for both of them.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.491
Yeah.

41:48.611 --> 41:51.747
She's saying some pretty
serious things about you too.

41:51.749 --> 41:53.833
About me?

41:53.835 --> 41:55.668
She said you gave her
a narcotic

41:55.670 --> 41:58.004
that was prescribed to you.

41:58.006 --> 42:02.224
She also says that you've been
on those pills for a while.

42:02.226 --> 42:04.810
Hank, the police want you
to submit to a tox screen,

42:04.812 --> 42:08.064
and I told them that
wouldn't be a problem.

42:08.066 --> 42:10.599
It isn't a problem, is it?

42:10.601 --> 42:12.435
Of course not.
