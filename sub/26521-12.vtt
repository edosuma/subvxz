[Boss Baby cooing]

[grunting]

00:52.260 --> 00:53.303
Die! Dead!

00:54.095 --> 00:57.849
And that is the story of my career
as of 30 minutes ago,

00:57.932 --> 01:03.271
when I allowed Frederic Estes to steal
Baby Corp's only vial of Stinkless Serum!

01:03.521 --> 01:04.898
Poor little metaphor!

01:04.981 --> 01:08.818
So, now we have maybe 15 minutes
to come up with a foolproof plan

01:08.902 --> 01:11.821
to keep Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby
from firing me.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.531
No wrong answers. Jimbo.

01:13.698 --> 01:14.949
Apology hugs?

01:15.033 --> 01:16.326
Wrong answer! Staci.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.204
I always keep a Plan "B" in my backpack.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.456
It's spiders!

01:21.623 --> 01:24.250
Oh, what? So you release them
into Baby Corp

01:24.334 --> 01:25.877
and I squash them, looking like a hero?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.838
Why would you kill my babies?

01:28.922 --> 01:29.923
[growls] Templeton!

01:30.006 --> 01:31.758
Sometimes when I mess up
with Mom and Dad,

01:31.841 --> 01:35.094
I do something nice to show I'm sorry,
like extra chores or--

01:35.178 --> 01:36.679
Brilliant, Templeton! Stop talking!

01:36.846 --> 01:38.473
I can see the plan now!

01:38.723 --> 01:43.394
Is that Boss Baby up there performing
unselfish service for this company?

01:43.561 --> 01:47.065
Please, Templeton,
I don't want recognition.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.526
Doing good is its own reward.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.569
What a virtuous example!

01:51.653 --> 01:54.823
Baby Corp is lucky to have him,
and should never consider firing him.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.991
Hello, work associates.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.078
Who would like to see my new trampoline?

02:00.161 --> 02:03.540
-What?
-How delightful! I will be right down.

02:03.623 --> 02:08.128
Oh, no! He's slipping
off the window washing platform!

-[babies gasping]
-[Boss] That is an accurate description

02:09.796 --> 02:11.256
of what is happening.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.223
How could such a terrible tragedy
have occurred?

02:20.306 --> 02:23.309
It no longer matters
what Boss Baby did wrong.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.271
Let us mourn him
in traditional baby style.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.315
[crying]

02:29.399 --> 02:32.068
Wah, wah, wah.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.196
Then I wait three weeks,
show up with a few bandages,

02:35.280 --> 02:38.158
and everyone's so glad to see me,
all is forgiven.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.909
Ooh! Great plan, Tim.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.870
That was nothing like my plan.

02:42.036 --> 02:45.039
Yeah, we plussed it in the meeting.
My career's on the line, Templeton.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.166
You in or out?

02:46.249 --> 02:48.751
-We're brothers. Of course I'm in.
-[Mom] Boys!

02:49.961 --> 02:53.256
Your dad and I were wondering
if you could keep all the screaming down.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.800
Um, no one's screaming, Mom.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.554
Well, you're about to be, from excitement,

02:59.637 --> 03:02.682
for end-of-summer
inside-the-house mini golf!

03:02.765 --> 03:06.352
[screaming]

03:06.436 --> 03:09.397
Your dad called dibs
on the front hallway for his hole.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.399
Gigantic rapids.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.693
Honey, do we any bigger canoes?

03:13.943 --> 03:17.947
And I'm cooking up a par seven nightmare
in the kitchen,

03:18.031 --> 03:21.451
so whatever hole you're designing,
challenge me!

03:21.659 --> 03:25.038
Oh, I got your challenge: Magma Madness,

03:25.121 --> 03:28.833
featuring vinegar
and baking soda volcanic explosions

03:28.917 --> 03:32.003
-that will crush your golf ball!
-[clattering]

03:33.630 --> 03:38.092
But, um, first, I'll need time
to let the baby help.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.053
It is his first family mini golf.

03:40.136 --> 03:41.888
We'll build Magma Madness together.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.473
Probably take us a while,
don't check on us.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.767
Why would you? What? Just mini golf stuff.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.684
Aw!

03:46.768 --> 03:48.519
What a good big brother.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.772
Yes, I am.

Tell me this is gonna be quick.

look like you were so terrified,

for tomorrow's local End o' Summer Fest.

and now Estes
wants to ruin the town carnival!

04:42.031 --> 04:44.075
What is happening to my end o' summer?

04:44.158 --> 04:46.160
Inconceivable as it might seem,

04:46.244 --> 04:51.457
we must assume our enemies have decoded
the formula for Stinkless Serum.

-Oh, no! Stinkless Serum!
-Oh, no!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.877
-That belongs to us!
-Already?

of their bad smells

and babies still stink,

Using the stolen vial
that was supposed to be guarded

05:09.350 --> 05:13.813
by our VP of Field Operations, Boss Baby.

-He's over there. You may frown at him.
-[all growling]

05:17.191 --> 05:21.654
Solution: If old people plan to unveil
their own Stinkless Serum tomorrow,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.948
we must make today our tomorrow.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.034
-[all] Huh?
-Explanation:

Drool stains. Sweaty little baby booties.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.181
In total, eight bad baby smells.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.849
Baby fatty roll crust?

05:49.932 --> 05:52.894
That's a Category Five baby odor,

or hurt Baby Corp.

for Stinkless Serum,

06:22.548 --> 06:23.883
[gasps] Ah!

06:24.383 --> 06:25.635
-I gotta crack that formula!
-CEO!

06:25.718 --> 06:27.136

06:27.386 --> 06:28.513

06:28.596 --> 06:32.475
5:00 p.m.? I can't take that long.
I'll miss mini golf.

Forget 5:00 p.m. With my desperation
and your chemistry skills,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.397
we'll have the serum cracked
in an hour, tops.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.649

this place is about to get nuts.

Backstabbing, sabotage,
alliances and betrayals.

not even you two.

-[Staci giggles]

07:07.969 --> 07:11.305

07:11.389 --> 07:14.809
You want me to use my dark powers
in your unholy service?

07:14.892 --> 07:15.977
-Yes, please.
-Cool.

Hey, come on. You don't want to win dirty.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.607
[Staci grumbling]

07:21.691 --> 07:23.860
I thought you were in a hurry
to get back for tiny golf.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.321
I am. But if I'm helping with this,
we do it my way.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.322
Your way?

07:28.406 --> 07:31.200
-Or should I say, the way of...

-the Third!

07:38.166 --> 07:39.667
There's my mad chemist.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.462
Bring me your smelliest challenge.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.090
We will fight its bad smells
with a concoction of good smells,

07:46.174 --> 07:49.844
and science away the stink. [cackles]

07:50.261 --> 07:51.888
Stanky Blankie!

that smell like hot dogs!

08:15.077 --> 08:17.163
[sniffs, shudders]

08:17.246 --> 08:21.209
It makes me want to cry and barf
and go doody all at once!

08:21.292 --> 08:22.335
[Boss grunts]

08:22.418 --> 08:23.628
We're getting nowhere!

08:24.212 --> 08:27.131
Your concoctions smell like wet dogs
and Southern dumpsters!

08:27.215 --> 08:29.175
Keep cracking, Baby Corp.

08:29.258 --> 08:34.347
Cast out your smelly missteps
and point your noses achievement-ward!

08:34.514 --> 08:37.433
You're right.
We'd have to be mad to continue!

08:37.517 --> 08:38.726
[cackles]

08:38.809 --> 08:39.810
Again!

08:39.977 --> 08:41.270
Fresh-baked bread!

08:41.354 --> 08:43.731
Candles from that store at the mall!

-Ginger ale burps!

Behold my creation: Werewolf Hot Rod!

08:52.323 --> 08:54.116
Uh, Werewolf Hot Rod?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.577
Every invention works better
with a cool name.

08:56.661 --> 09:00.540
That's a mad science fact.
Now put it to the test!

09:12.426 --> 09:13.803
Werewolf Hot Rod!

09:13.886 --> 09:16.347
It destinkified drool stains and spit-up!

09:16.430 --> 09:18.641
-That's two bad smells down!
-[monitor beeping]

09:19.642 --> 09:21.185
-[baby 1] What? No!
-[baby 2] No!

09:21.269 --> 09:22.812
-Boss Baby got two already!
-But--!

09:23.688 --> 09:28.401
Nothing to see, people!
Eyes on your own work! Come on!

09:28.651 --> 09:30.194
-Darn it!
-Why "darn it"?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.572
You've cracked two out of eight
bad smells already.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.325
I thought we'd be done by now.
This is gonna take forever!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.160
You're on a roll, Dr. Baron.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.162
-Just keep your head in the game.
-Don't say "game!"

09:40.246 --> 09:43.249
I'm trying not to think
about the mini golf game back at home,

09:43.332 --> 09:46.127
and now I'm thinking about
the mini golf game back at home.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.255
Hoo-hoo! I solved spit-up smell!

09:49.338 --> 09:52.925
Look out, CEO job, I'm coming for you!

09:53.301 --> 09:55.344
The others are catching up.
Faster, Templeton!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.764
Think, think! We need a hole in one.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.517
Ugh! I can't stop thinking
about mini golf!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.436
You gotta unleash me, sir.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.938
I can slow down the competition
like molasses.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.941
Sorry, I meant with molasses.
Or spider backpack.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.319
Just so you know,
that option's still on the table.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.071
Hey! I said we don't have to win dirty.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.157
But I really wanna!

10:16.240 --> 10:19.827
Jimbo can handle mixing
Tim's science junk by himself.

10:19.910 --> 10:20.828
Don't make me!

10:20.911 --> 10:24.373
I already got werewolf smell
all over my fingers, and it's scaring me!

10:24.457 --> 10:25.833
Everybody calm down.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.877
Staci, you know
I love your twisted handiwork,

10:27.960 --> 10:29.754
but Templeton says he's got this.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.339
Go make a supply run. Cool down.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.883
Fine!

10:34.175 --> 10:36.093
Jimbo, let's hose that werewolf stink
off your hands.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.470
Yay!

10:37.553 --> 10:38.596
[sniffs, screams]

10:40.431 --> 10:42.183
-Templeton.
-Ten-minute golf break?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.517
-Sure.
-Yes!

10:43.601 --> 10:46.354
If you'll solve one more smell for me
before you go.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.438
Deal!

10:47.521 --> 10:48.522
[Jimbo mumbles]

10:52.318 --> 10:55.446
[Chip] Ah, come on!
You're killing me, spit-up!

10:55.529 --> 10:57.573
-Worker Baby Chip, right? What's wrong?
-[sniffs]

10:57.657 --> 11:00.117
Just can't seem to un-stink
the grossed-out bib.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.243
[yells]

11:01.494 --> 11:04.413
My serum works on the booties,
the sour milk bottle--

11:04.497 --> 11:06.040
You cracked sour milk bottle?

11:06.123 --> 11:07.958
Oh, yeah, that one was tough.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.461
But I hear you solved the drool stains.

11:10.544 --> 11:13.672
[chuckles] Yeah. Now, that one was-- Wait.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.633
If I've got drool stain beat,

11:15.716 --> 11:18.636
-and you've got sour milk...
-Swap formulas?

11:19.011 --> 11:19.970
Nuh-uh!

11:20.054 --> 11:21.764
I don't want to give your team
an advantage

11:21.847 --> 11:24.767
when you're just a putt away
from the winning shot.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.270
[echoing]  Putt away! Winning shot!
Putt away! Winning shot!

11:28.354 --> 11:29.688
Mini golf.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.441
We have to swap formula secrets.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.735
It would help both of us.
That's fair, right?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.781
That should fix sour milk for you.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.616
And there's your drool-proof solution.

11:40.699 --> 11:44.078
Oh, and real quick,
can I borrow your stinkiest formula?

11:44.161 --> 11:46.455
This one smells like asparagus farts!

11:46.539 --> 11:49.708
Perfect! Finally, it's tee time for Tim!

11:51.043 --> 11:52.169
What's this?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.630
The solution for sour milk. Golf break!

11:54.713 --> 11:57.716
Send me three beeps on the baby monitor
if you have an emergency!

11:58.509 --> 12:01.679
-You boys good to golf? Tim?
-[toilet flushes]

12:02.430 --> 12:04.598
-[parents groaning]
-Don't go in there!

12:05.099 --> 12:07.017
Bad asparagus sickness.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.063
Wait. I haven't bought any asparagus
since-- [gasps] That explains so much!

12:11.147 --> 12:13.732
Your mom and I are ready to putt
whenever you are!

12:13.816 --> 12:16.026
-How's Magma Madness?
-Fine. Baby's sleeping.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.154
We shouldn't talk about it anymore.
It might wake him.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.738
Can we golf a different hole
while we're waiting?

12:20.156 --> 12:25.286
Oh, well, sure,
if you think you're ready to face...

12:25.369 --> 12:28.956
the Labyrinth of Red-Footed Death!

12:29.540 --> 12:32.751
If you can sink it in the red shoe
in less than three putts,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.670
you get double dessert for a week.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.047
Triple desserts if I sink it in two.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.049
[chuckles] It's on!

12:43.345 --> 12:45.222
[clinking]

12:51.812 --> 12:54.815
-Yes!
-One more putt to hit the red shoe.

12:54.899 --> 12:58.903
Triple desserts on the line.
To the victor, fudgy glory.

12:58.986 --> 13:03.282
Will Tim Templeton's parents be dealing
with bedtime hyperactivity all week?

13:03.365 --> 13:04.575
[Tim sighs]

13:05.618 --> 13:06.660
-[baby monitor chiming]
-[gasps]

13:06.744 --> 13:07.912
What's that beeping?

13:07.995 --> 13:10.456
One of my toys is out of batteries.
Don't worry about it.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.959
-[chiming continues]
-[growls]

13:14.668 --> 13:15.503
-Whoops!
-[clattering]

13:16.212 --> 13:18.339
Shoot! That leads downstairs.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.758
I'm gonna have to go find that ball
in the basement.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.802
I might be a while, but don't come
help me. This is my responsibility! Bye!

13:23.886 --> 13:25.804
Way to play with honor, son!

13:26.472 --> 13:28.933
I was one putt away from triple desserts!

13:29.016 --> 13:30.309
This better be important.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.144
Ugh! What's that smell?

13:32.311 --> 13:35.314
-That's the stink of betrayal!
-What?

13:35.564 --> 13:37.691
That formula didn't solve sour milk!

13:37.775 --> 13:40.903
Expired cottage cheese, plus clam juice?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.113
Who thought that was gonna work?

13:43.197 --> 13:46.867
-But I traded with--
-Chip, of all babies?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.161
Chip who steals copy machines?

13:49.245 --> 13:54.875
I told you we couldn't trust anyone,
but most of all, never trust a Chip!

13:54.959 --> 13:57.962
I did it! De-stunked another one!

13:58.087 --> 14:02.758
Sour milk, spit-up, sweaty baby booties,
and drool stains!

14:02.841 --> 14:04.343
[monitor beeping]

14:04.426 --> 14:07.179
-[baby 1] Drool stains?
-[baby 2] Impossible! How did he get that?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.430
Whoa!

14:08.639 --> 14:10.266
Four down, four to go.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.768
Sniff my inevitable victory, loser babies!

14:12.851 --> 14:13.727
[Turtleneck] Bravo, Chip!

14:13.811 --> 14:15.020
[sniffing]

14:15.104 --> 14:17.064
Do I smell a future CEO?

14:17.439 --> 14:18.816
[chuckles]

14:18.899 --> 14:20.693
Not yet. Keep working, babies.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.320
We had a deal! It was fair!

14:23.404 --> 14:26.198
Don't cry over sour milk! [chuckles]

14:26.282 --> 14:28.450
I tried to warn you, Templeton.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.119
You're in the corporate jungle now.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.580
The only thing you can trust
is your own success,

14:32.663 --> 14:34.957
and even that can stab you in the back.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.292
Try it, Success!

14:37.209 --> 14:38.502
[both sigh]

14:38.586 --> 14:39.837
Don't feel too bad.

14:40.254 --> 14:44.008
I'm sure your back wasn't the first one
stabbed today, and it won't be the last.

14:44.091 --> 14:47.720
Chief Exec! Chief Exec! Chief-- Hey!

14:47.803 --> 14:51.015
Chip, you rot! All your work was mine!

14:51.098 --> 14:52.766
We had an alliance, bro!

14:52.850 --> 14:54.393
Since when are you alliance buddies
with Chip?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.729
I thought we were working together.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.980
Not cool, Amal!

14:58.063 --> 15:01.108
-[Amal] See? It wasn't just me!
-[Chip] Don't blame me for everything!

15:01.191 --> 15:02.443
[all arguing]

15:02.526 --> 15:04.361
It has begun.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.363
[panting]

15:06.447 --> 15:11.327
Boss Baby! My partners all betrayed me,
but they didn't take my notes.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.497
-Maybe you and I could form an--
-No! Scat! Get out of here, Simmons!

15:16.248 --> 15:17.791
We're still high up on the leaderboard,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.670
and all the corporate zombies
are gonna want a piece of our brains.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.006
Don't let them eat my shot at being CEO.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.592
Templeton, double time
on the stinkless chemistry.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.886
And get me back to mini golf.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.763
Staci, take Jimbo with you.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.806
-The moment has come.
-[Staci cackles]

15:32.890 --> 15:33.724
[Jimbo gasps]

15:33.933 --> 15:34.767
Wait. What is Staci--?

15:34.850 --> 15:37.978
Just making sure you and I
can work without interference.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.940
Keep them fighting, keep them panicked.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.359
Just keep them away from the Boss and Tim.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.153
-Come on, now! We had an agreement.
-You started it!

15:46.236 --> 15:47.613
-How could you?
-[blows raspberry]

15:47.988 --> 15:51.742
Staci. Hey. I see Double B's
riding second right behind Chip.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.786
I'm thinking,
if your team partnered up with me--

15:53.869 --> 15:55.704
No! Your team and me!

15:55.996 --> 15:56.830
[snaps fingers]

15:57.331 --> 15:59.333
[gasping]

15:59.416 --> 16:03.420
[gasps] Chip's stealing your work again?

16:04.088 --> 16:08.050
What? I did not! But I totally would.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.426
Eat chemistry, Chip!

16:09.718 --> 16:11.136
[grunting]

16:13.555 --> 16:16.767
-[Templeton] Yes! We got three more!
-[monitor beeping]

16:16.850 --> 16:21.188
What? Boss Baby's team solved
Dirty Diaper and Stanky Blankie?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.899
I am still stuck on my second stink!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.359
I must know his secrets!

16:25.442 --> 16:29.530
Mad Dog Phil smells an opportunity
to piggyback on others' success!

16:30.614 --> 16:31.532
[gasps]

16:32.116 --> 16:34.702
They're hungry for ideas,
and have none of their own!

16:34.785 --> 16:37.079
It's a corporate zombie invasion!

16:37.329 --> 16:38.163
[both gasp]

16:38.247 --> 16:40.874
[all groaning, snarling]

16:44.169 --> 16:45.546
How do we stop them?

16:46.338 --> 16:52.469
What? All of you want me to sabotage
the hard work of Security Baby Katja?

16:52.886 --> 16:56.265
I will teach you the price of betrayal!

16:56.473 --> 16:57.474
[all gasping]

16:57.558 --> 16:59.268
Uncle's breath!

16:59.351 --> 17:02.312
[retching]

17:03.564 --> 17:07.568
I claim all your research
as the spoils of war!

17:08.110 --> 17:10.029
-Hey!
-No fair!

17:10.112 --> 17:12.698
You just made the mad dog rabid!

17:12.781 --> 17:14.825
[howls]

17:15.534 --> 17:18.704
[screaming]

17:18.787 --> 17:19.997
[panting] Ha!

17:20.372 --> 17:21.206
[grunts]

17:22.082 --> 17:24.585
-[roars] I'm angry!
-[gasps]

17:24.668 --> 17:25.836
[grunts]

17:27.004 --> 17:27.838
[yells]

17:28.630 --> 17:31.467
-[yelling]
-[whimpering]

17:32.301 --> 17:33.510
-[grunts]
-[teddy bear squeaks]

17:33.719 --> 17:36.138
[all yelling]

17:36.263 --> 17:38.098
Are you sure you want to win like this?

17:38.182 --> 17:41.727
Trust me,
it'll all be worth it once I'm CEO.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.520
It's been too long.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.856
I need to check in at mini golf,
and you should too.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.776
It's the final 40 minutes.
Everything's on the line.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.445
And Mom and Dad aren't going to believe
you're napping forever.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.572
I'm telling you, we need to do this.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.199
Do you not even trust me anymore?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.534
[sighs] Five minutes.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.912
Whatever we need to do,
you get us back here, ASAP.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.083
-[Mom] There you two are!
-[baby coos]

18:04.208 --> 18:06.794
Did-did you not work
on your golf holes at all?

18:06.877 --> 18:08.545
I guess we were too busy playing.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.548
Well, Gigantic Rapids is ready to swing.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.802
Come on, grab your club.
We'll do Magma Madness later.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.639
Is it a long course?

18:18.722 --> 18:21.975
[chuckles] If I know your dad,
it's gonna be brutal.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.729
The Gator Moat of Croco-Death alone
is a solid 20 minutes.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.024
I rented a real iguana.
Fair warning, he's a biter.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.652
What if I only have five minutes?

18:31.735 --> 18:32.569
[laughs]

18:32.653 --> 18:36.573
You're a kid. You've got nothing
but free time. Let's golf!

18:40.744 --> 18:41.745
[growls]

18:42.913 --> 18:44.331
Mom, Dad.

18:45.457 --> 18:51.463
-I-- I don't want to play mini golf.
-[Dad] What?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.090
I thought you loved it.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.969
I do love spending time with you guys.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.888
And I know you both love mini golf.

19:00.389 --> 19:05.352
But I guess maybe I outgrew it.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.856
Sorry, Tim. I wish you'd have told us.

19:08.939 --> 19:13.360
Okay. No more inside-the-house mini golf.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.071
I guess we'll find other traditions.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.950
Thank you, Templeton.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.827
You're the one person
I can always count on.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.163
I told them I hated mini golf.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.082
I love mini golf!

19:27.166 --> 19:30.294
-Templeton, I-- I didn't intend to--
-Let's go crack your stupid serum,

19:30.377 --> 19:32.880
so I never have to think
about this day again.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.342
[whimpering]

19:37.426 --> 19:38.719
[babies shouting]

19:40.971 --> 19:42.264
[timer beeping]

19:43.599 --> 19:45.100
Pencils down. No time to test it.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.435
What do we call this one?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.061
Golf Slayer.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.855
Templeton.

19:54.651 --> 19:59.072
It's no inside-the-house family mini golf,
but it's the best I can do.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.910
Come on, I guarantee you a hole in one.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.376
[Boss] Boom, baby.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.128
I hope you get the job.

20:14.630 --> 20:19.801
This day was a rollercoaster ride,
right down to the fear, the adrenaline,

20:19.968 --> 20:23.096
and the flying chunks of goop everywhere.

20:23.180 --> 20:27.476
But my fears have been allayed
and my hopes rewarded.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.395
I am over the moon with excitement,

20:30.479 --> 20:37.444
bursting at the seams because Baby Corp
once more has its Stinkless Serum!

20:37.569 --> 20:38.904
-No way!
-[all gasping]

20:39.112 --> 20:40.364
[baby] Amazing!

20:41.823 --> 20:45.202
Do you think it was us? No, probably not.
Impossible. Maybe? Gah!

20:45.285 --> 20:46.161
Just spill it!

20:46.245 --> 20:53.085
Congratulations to our winner,
the next CEO of Baby Corp...

20:53.794 --> 20:55.212
Boss Baby!

20:56.338 --> 20:59.049
Boss! You're the boss, Boss Baby!

20:59.132 --> 21:00.717
I'm the CEO?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.388
-I'm the CEO! [laughs]
-[cheering]

21:04.471 --> 21:05.555
I did it!

21:05.806 --> 21:08.725
-I'm happy you got what you wanted.
-[laughter continues]

21:10.185 --> 21:11.937
[Turtleneck] Celebrate today, Boss Baby!

21:12.104 --> 21:15.148
We'll make it official
with the Board of Directors tomorrow.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.483
[cheering continues]

21:17.985 --> 21:21.071
Sorry, buddy. You know it's my nature.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.656
Hey, I respect the game.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.202
-You're not partying with us?
-I had to write a letter to my brother.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.579
-Want me to give it to him?
-Nah.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.082
I'll just leave it
on his new CEO desk for tomorrow.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.625
Don't want to step on his big day.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.586
-You're a good brother, Tim.
-Thanks.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.381
It's been fun working with you, Jimbo.
Maybe I'll see you around.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.634
-Huh? Where are you going?
-I'm quitting the field team.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.263
What?

21:47.264 --> 21:52.811
Hello? Miss, um, Turtleneck Superstar CEO
Still-For-Now Baby?

21:52.894 --> 21:56.273
I'm just leaving something for my brother
to read when he moves in.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.191
Huh?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.863
Intervention! [yells]

22:02.946 --> 22:05.032
You are not quitting our field team!

22:05.115 --> 22:06.825
We don't accept this letter!

22:06.908 --> 22:08.702
That's not my letter.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.954
It was already on the CEO's desk.

22:12.080 --> 22:17.502
"Come and get her. X-O-X-O..."
[gasps] "Fred"!

22:17.586 --> 22:19.921
I think Estes kidnapped Turtleneck!

22:20.047 --> 22:21.340
But what does it mean?

22:21.423 --> 22:22.883
It means war.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.430
Yeah! [laughs]

22:28.513 --> 22:33.393
[sings tune]

22:35.771 --> 22:37.731
Inappropriate for the moment.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.691
Yes, I can see that now.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.133
