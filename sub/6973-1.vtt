[Scully Narrating] I came in search
of something I did not believe existed.

I've stayed on now
in spite of myself,

00:20.587 --> 00:24.489
in spite of everything
I've ever held to be true.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.595
I will continue here
as long as I can...

00:31.664 --> 00:34.189
as long as you are beset
by the haunting illness...

00:34.267 --> 00:37.896
which I saw consume
your beautiful mind.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.804
What is this discovery
I've made?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.809
How can I reconcile what I see
with what I know?

00:44.944 --> 00:47.469
I feel this was meant
not for me to find,

00:47.547 --> 00:50.072
but for you
to make sense of...

00:50.150 --> 00:52.914
make the connections
which can't be ignored.

00:54.654 --> 00:58.954
Connections which, for me,
deny all logic and reason.

01:02.729 --> 01:07.462
What is this source of power
I hold in my hand... this rubbing?

01:07.534 --> 01:12.437
This simple impression taken
from the surface of the craft?

01:12.505 --> 01:16.737
I watched this rubbing take
its undeniable hold on you...

01:16.810 --> 01:18.971
saw you succumb to
its spiraling effect.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.639
Now, I must work to uncover...

01:21.714 --> 01:24.581
what your illness
prevents you from finding.

In the source of every illness
lies its cure.

But he doesn't sleep.

03:50.828 --> 03:52.762
There's activity in
the temporal lobe...

03:52.830 --> 03:55.321
we've just never seen.

03:55.399 --> 03:59.927
It won't allow his brain
to rest or shut down,

04:00.004 --> 04:02.598
manifesting in episodes
of aggression.

04:02.673 --> 04:04.834
Sometimes against himself.

04:04.909 --> 04:08.242
- You can't sedate him?
- Yes.

04:08.312 --> 04:12.248
We slow him down for short periods
and put him in the neuro ward.

It's the only way
we're able to run tests.

it is still a secret,

is on constant redline.

just to keep him on the monitors.

16:17.704 --> 16:21.071

- He becomes violently agitated.

even when he's medicated.

- Was his...

about his prior mental state,

- Doesn't mean I can do
anything for him.

to a question that... I didn't ask.

to trust?

that could slow the electrical
impulses to a normal rate.

and nobody knew?

Well, I just came on.
Sorry. Uh, Fox Mulder, right?

19:43.944 --> 19:46.037

And he's not in his bed?

19:46.113 --> 19:49.446

can I say it?

when I came in.

19:59.493 --> 20:02.155
No, we just found him
down the hall.

20:02.229 --> 20:04.390
- I just got him back into bed.
- Who are you?

20:04.464 --> 20:07.024
- I'm his boss, and hers.
- Well, I don't know...

20:07.100 --> 20:09.898
how he could've gotten up by himself
or pulled all this stuff out.

20:09.970 --> 20:10.604
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor
and making a report on this.

20:10.604 --> 20:13.402
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor
and making a report on this.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.407

in this bed.

- I don't know where she is.

that I need.

- Him.

21:10.328 --> 21:13.024

- Prove what?

21:13.098 --> 21:15.760
What's causing this.

21:15.834 --> 21:19.600
It's a brain abnormality.
It's how you're able to read minds.

21:19.671 --> 21:23.869
What's causing this is alien.
It's why my doctors can't help me.

21:23.942 --> 21:26.308
I don't believe in aliens, Agent Mulder.
I think you know that.

That's why I need you.

are part of a complex communication.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.607
Dr. Barnes has broken some
of the symbols into letters,

21:59.678 --> 22:02.203
using an ancient
Navaho alphabet.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.374
And though it has helped
to uncover some of what's here,

22:05.450 --> 22:08.886
it has also made
for greater confusion.

22:16.761 --> 22:19.252
On the top surface of the craft,
I'm finding words...

22:19.331 --> 22:21.595
describing human genetics.

22:27.072 --> 22:31.202
Efforts to read the bottom
of the craft have been harder.

22:31.276 --> 22:34.939
Our workers were scared away
by a phenomena I admit I can't explain.

22:36.681 --> 22:39.445
A sea of blood,
a swarm of insects.

22:41.052 --> 22:43.953
But what little we've found
has been staggering.

22:44.022 --> 22:47.082
Passages from
the Christian Bible,

22:47.158 --> 22:50.650
from Pagan religions,
from ancient Sumaria.

22:50.729 --> 22:53.789
Science and mysticism
conjoined.

22:53.865 --> 22:58.393
But more than words,
they are somehow imbued with power.

22:59.537 --> 23:02.597
I've ignored warnings
to quit this work,

23:02.674 --> 23:05.871
remaining committed
to finding answers,

23:05.944 --> 23:08.708
afraid only that
our secret here won't last...

23:08.780 --> 23:11.078
and that I
might be too late.

23:16.721 --> 23:18.655
I have something
to show you.

23:18.723 --> 23:20.657
More pieces of the puzzle.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.823
I couldn't believe it.

23:26.898 --> 23:29.833
I thought I was
making it up in my head,

23:29.901 --> 23:32.768
- that it could not be true.
- What?

23:32.837 --> 23:35.965
What this is.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.669
What the symbols spell out
is a passage from the Koran.

23:41.112 --> 23:45.173
Quyama...
the day of final judgement.

23:46.851 --> 23:49.012
On a spacecraft,

23:49.087 --> 23:51.487
teachings of
the ancient prophet Mohammed?

23:54.159 --> 23:56.093
I found more too.

24:00.565 --> 24:03.193
Twenty-four panels.

24:03.268 --> 24:05.634
One for each
human chromosome.

24:07.405 --> 24:10.841
A map of their makeup.
Maybe a map...

24:10.909 --> 24:13.400
of our entire
genetic makeup.

24:14.779 --> 24:17.043
A complete human genome.

24:19.951 --> 24:22.044
I mean, it's like...

24:22.120 --> 24:26.113
it's the most beautiful,
intricate work of art.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.626
It is the word of God.

24:31.529 --> 24:33.520
[Barnes]
You're wrong.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.934
There is no God.

24:39.537 --> 24:41.664
What's out there
in the water...

24:41.739 --> 24:44.173
is only what we call "God"...

24:44.242 --> 24:46.369
what we call "creation."

24:46.444 --> 24:48.742
The spark that ignited
the fire that cooked...

24:48.813 --> 24:50.804
the old primordial soup.

24:50.882 --> 24:53.749
Made animate from inanimate.
Made us.

24:53.818 --> 24:56.378
I believe he is mad
from the sun.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.423
Mad?
I'm perfectly sane.

25:00.859 --> 25:03.419
Because today,
I understand everything.

25:03.495 --> 25:07.488
Beginning and end, alpha and omega,
everything in between.

25:07.565 --> 25:11.558
It's all been written,
but the word is extraterrestrial.

25:11.636 --> 25:14.537
You're sick, Dr. Barnes.

25:14.606 --> 25:16.540
You need to get
off your feet.

25:16.608 --> 25:19.236
Lie down.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.677
You think you're going
to take the credit?

25:22.747 --> 25:24.681
This is my discovery.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.944
I'm only here
to help my friend.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.147
You can't help him.

25:31.222 --> 25:33.247
You're wasting your time
reading it.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.593
It has power.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.959
It is power.

25:39.030 --> 25:41.021
The ultimate power.

25:42.133 --> 25:44.761
Your friend
just got too close.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.614
No one leaves here
before me.

26:05.889 --> 26:10.349
[Kritschgau] We developed this
to test remote viewing capabilities.

26:10.427 --> 26:13.294
It works much like
a card trick.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.888
You tap the monitor where
the saucer image appears,

26:15.965 --> 26:18.559
when it appears,
or when you think it does.

26:18.635 --> 26:21.069
Okay?

26:21.137 --> 26:23.298
Who are you gonna call?

26:32.649 --> 26:34.810
Now.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.819
Now. Now.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.152
Now. Now.

26:41.224 --> 26:44.352
Now. Now.

26:46.429 --> 26:49.125
- Now.
- All right, Agent Mulder. Fine.

26:49.199 --> 26:52.032
You're at about
five percent accuracy.

26:52.101 --> 26:54.331
I'm assuming that's low.

26:54.404 --> 26:59.603
Yeah. At the C.I.A., a high degree
of ability was 20 percent.

26:59.676 --> 27:02.270
- Twenty-five percent was extraordinary.
- But I see them in my head.

27:02.345 --> 27:05.781
You saw his ability earlier.
It was you who pointed it out.

27:05.849 --> 27:09.546
Well, our tests show that some people
have psychic ability, sure.

27:09.619 --> 27:12.952
I mean, E.S.P., clairvoyance,
remote viewing.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.217
But it was never attributed
to aliens.

27:15.291 --> 27:17.885
You don't want to believe.

27:20.697 --> 27:22.631
You're not looking
hard enough.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.474
One more time...
faster.

28:00.336 --> 28:02.201
[Kritschgau]
He's ahead of the images.

28:03.673 --> 28:05.937
He's anticipating them.

They were dead!

29:03.700 --> 29:05.634
They've come back to life!

29:07.236 --> 29:09.295
The ship...
it brought them back to life!

29:38.601 --> 29:40.967
We have to get
to the police.

29:41.037 --> 29:44.268
That is where I am going.
This is the road to Abajan.

29:47.308 --> 29:49.139
- Stop!
- [Tires Screeching]

29:54.849 --> 29:58.717
[Panting]
That was him!

29:58.786 --> 30:02.722
That was the man I saw in the tent...
in the road.

30:10.097 --> 30:12.793
Some truths
are not for you.

30:23.277 --> 30:26.144
- Are you all right?
- [Gasps]

30:26.214 --> 30:30.014
- Oh, God. What are you doing?
- You were cold.

30:30.084 --> 30:32.575
I was just feeling to see
if you were still alive.

30:32.653 --> 30:34.814
- What happened to you?
- To me?

30:34.889 --> 30:37.824
You slammed on the brakes.
There was a man.

30:37.892 --> 30:39.757
- That's right... in the road.
- No.

30:39.827 --> 30:43.923
He was right there, sitting
right where you are in your seat.

30:47.368 --> 30:50.428
The men were right.
This is a bad sign.

30:52.006 --> 30:54.236
A sign to give up.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.040
[Starts Engine]

30:59.981 --> 31:02.711
- Turn us around.
- Not back to the beach.

31:04.018 --> 31:07.181
No.
I'm going home.

Agent Mulder?

31:15.930 --> 31:18.296
Agent Mulder, I don't know
if you can hear me,

31:18.366 --> 31:21.199
but we're gonna try
to get you out of here.

31:25.139 --> 31:27.073
A.M. Nurse is on
in five minutes.

31:27.141 --> 31:29.439
- We gotta move.
- I don't think he's in any shape.

31:29.510 --> 31:31.444
I'm gonna hit him
pretty hard.

31:31.512 --> 31:33.605
Maybe we can get him
on his feet.

31:33.681 --> 31:36.775
- What are you doing?
- Look, I know what you're doing.

31:36.851 --> 31:40.184
- I'm trying to help him.
- This isn't about him.

31:40.254 --> 31:42.484
It's about you. It's about revenge
against the government...

31:42.556 --> 31:44.490
for trying to destroy
your life.

31:44.558 --> 31:46.992
I was destroyed to protect what Mulder
knew all along. Now he's the proof.

31:47.061 --> 31:50.588
- He's the X-File.
- We can't just keep
shooting him full of drugs.

31:50.665 --> 31:53.498
- It's gone too far.
- How far should it go?

31:53.567 --> 31:55.797
How far
would Mulder go?

Step away.

32:38.179 --> 32:40.306
Agent Fowley, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

32:40.381 --> 32:44.317
What am I doing?
What are you doing, sir, with this?

32:46.354 --> 32:48.618
I want you
to face the wall.

32:48.689 --> 32:51.351
Do you hear me?
Face the wall!

32:53.761 --> 32:57.322
- Let me explain.
- What was this man given?

32:57.398 --> 32:59.332
What was in
this syringe?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.334
Phenytoin.

33:01.402 --> 33:03.495
Let me tell you
what it does.

you're suffering from.

I've been sitting back
and watching.

I know you know.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.581
I know you know
about me.

34:30.656 --> 34:33.056
That my loyalties
aren't just to you,

34:35.127 --> 34:37.618
but to a man
you've grown to despise.

34:41.867 --> 34:44.391
You have your reasons.

34:44.469 --> 34:48.907
But as you look inside me now,
you know that I have mine.

to prove what's inside you.

to prove it.

- Agent Scully!
- I have been on a plane for 22 hours.

- I have to see him.

if you can even get
on the ward.

They won't treat him because
they don't know what's wrong with him.

I had to do something.

37:29.535 --> 37:31.901
He's not dying.

I'm afraid it's true.

He is more alive

37:39.745 --> 37:42.578
He's more alive than
his body can withstand.

may be extraterrestrial in origin.

37:50.322 --> 37:52.415
