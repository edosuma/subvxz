NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.168 --> 00:03.336
Melvin Palmer, how are you?

00:03.420 --> 00:06.172
I'm grand actually,
but I go by Alan Shore.

00:06.256 --> 00:09.050
You're a hoot, that's what.
We have an expression in Texas.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.636
You're all hat and no cattle.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.097
I know I've seen your face.
I don't know your real identity,

00:14.180 --> 00:16.266
but I know you've only been
Lorraine Weller since 1997.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.892
I owned and operated a brothel.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.061
After being arrested,
I reached a deal with the authorities

00:20.145 --> 00:22.897
whereby I would not be prosecuted
if I agreed to disappear.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.358
Jerry, would you like
to get a drink with me?

00:25.442 --> 00:26.526
We all know what's supposed to happen
on the third date

00:26.609 --> 00:27.652
after two wonderful dates.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.613
-You've really never kissed a woman?
-Not a real one.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.781
Oh, thank you, God.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.283
I don't wanna be let out. Just let her in.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.744
Would you be riding on the elevator
with us?

00:35.827 --> 00:36.953
Think you can handle it, Denny?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.622
(upbeat Christmas music playing)

00:39.706 --> 00:42.667
<i>♪ Oh, candles burnin' up ♪</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:45.837

00:59.392 --> 01:02.562
Ah. Scotch and eggnog, hold the nog?

01:02.645 --> 01:03.772
(chuckles) No, thank you.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.443
What's with the... all the guns here,
Denny, if you don't mind my asking.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.446
Oh, Coast Guard Auxiliary.
I'm serving my country. It's fantastic.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.866
Getting reacquainted with weaponry.
Wanna join?

01:15.617 --> 01:20.497
Actually, Denny, I do serve my country,
which is one of the reasons I'm here.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.999
In fact, I joined the board
of Green People

01:23.083 --> 01:26.211
to save this country
as well as the planet.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.923
-(sighs)
-Denny, this is a little awkward.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.303
Green People hired Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt
on my recommendation,

01:35.386 --> 01:37.388
and the only reason
I made that recommendation

01:37.472 --> 01:40.350
was because you told me
your firm was extremely green.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.392
Yeah. So?

01:41.476 --> 01:44.062
-Well, it's not. Not really.
-What are you talking about?

01:44.145 --> 01:47.357
We have all these, uh,
curlicue light bulbs.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.152
Yeah. Well, there are major areas
where this firm is not green.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.155
You have no solar panels,
no carpool policies.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.118
I discovered you recently threw away
your old computers,

01:58.201 --> 02:00.370
-which contain hazardous waste.
-Oh, Walt.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.455
And which will probably wind up
in the landfill.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.416
Meanwhile, Green People
is paying your firm legal fees

02:05.500 --> 02:07.710
in the six figures every year.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.795
Bottom line, Denny,

02:08.878 --> 02:11.339
get green, or I'll recommend
we hire another law firm.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.883
Walt, may I say something?

02:14.843 --> 02:15.677
Okay.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.096
I love the environment. I really do.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.142
And every day, I kiss the ground
I walk on, as do many others,

02:22.225 --> 02:24.435
because I am, after all, Denny Crane.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.647
-Oh, God.
-What's this? You got a tic?

02:27.730 --> 02:31.693
Denny, I take this cause seriously.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.987
I'm committing the rest of my life to it.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.114
I told you it was important
for our law firm

02:36.197 --> 02:37.657
to be environmentally conscious.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.118
You're wearing blinking antlers,
for God's sakes!

02:40.201 --> 02:41.786
Walt, it's Christmas!

02:41.870 --> 02:45.582
It's the time of year to embrace giving
and getting, and waste, and gluttony,

02:45.665 --> 02:48.418
and all the things that made God
and this country great.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.586
Don't be such a girl.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.880
-Now I am getting angry.
-Well, so am I.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.257
Frankly, I hope this planet survives.
I really do.

02:54.340 --> 02:59.179
But I am getting sick of you smug,
hybrid-driving socialists

02:59.262 --> 03:00.763
telling the rest of us
how to live our lives.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.892
I'm rich, okay? I like to guzzle
a little gas now and then.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.103
I keep my thermostat at 72
during the winter.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.356
I prefer night games in football.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.151
And I am fed up with you
global-warming wusses

03:13.234 --> 03:14.611
raining on my electric parade!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.613
You can be such an arrogant,

03:16.696 --> 03:18.615
-ignorant ass!
-DENNY: So can you.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.288
Good news, it's paint.
Bad news, it's not biodegradable.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.249
Nobody comes into my office
and ruins my Christmas

03:28.541 --> 03:31.836
with a load of save-the-planet,
atheist, communist crap.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.046
Off you go now.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.679

04:08.373 --> 04:10.333
Ah, these things happen.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.711
Argument between two old friends.
You'd understand if you had any.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.004
"These things happen."

04:15.088 --> 04:17.548
You opened fire on him
with a paint ball gun?

04:17.632 --> 04:18.466
Mm-hmm.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.552
Am I the only one who's getting
a little sick of these greenies?

04:21.636 --> 04:24.764
If they had their way,
we'd be living in caves like terrorists.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.934
Where's Shirley, by the way?
I prefer her reprimanding me.

04:28.017 --> 04:32.230
Shirley's in Atlanta at a conference,
ironically, on environmental law.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.983
Denny, this greenie is suing us for fraud.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.609
He claims you misrepresented us

04:36.693 --> 04:39.862
as being
an environmentally-conscious firm.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.950
Oh, send him some Joan Baez tapes
tied together with hemp rope.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.620
No, they're asking us for all the money
they ever paid us in legal fees.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.289
That's in the millions.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.750
Plus three times that in punitive damages.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.876
-Ah.
-CARL: Denny...

05:00.133 --> 05:06.055
Denny, the bigger problem is now
that all corporations are going green,

05:06.347 --> 05:09.350
we could be shunned
if we're perceived not to be.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.272
That means no more business from anybody.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.190
Whatever.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.777
Clarence?

05:20.778 --> 05:24.407
You've been staring at my pencil cup
for about 30 seconds.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.700
Is there something wrong?

05:27.076 --> 05:30.121
I'm too embarrassed to even say.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.373
Just tell me.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.836
-I lost my house.
-What?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.713
The bank foreclosed.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.550
-Were you not making payments?
-I was, but...

05:43.801 --> 05:45.386
But what? What happened?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.181
The interest rates just kept exploding.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.559
I bought about three years ago.
I didn't have to put anything down.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.269
-You got an adjustable rate.
-CLARENCE: Yes.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.774
And at first, I could make the increases,
and then they went up 30 percent.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.234
And then they went up again.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.863
I'm still paying off student loans
from law school.

06:03.946 --> 06:06.324
These increases have wiped out
my savings and, well--

06:08.368 --> 06:10.370
I missed the last two months.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.122
-I feel like such an idiot.
-And they're foreclosing.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.582
I can't get the bank to even talk to me.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.876
-They're not taking your house.
-They're within their rights.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.419
I don't care.
They're not taking your house.

06:19.879 --> 06:20.713
It's Christmas.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.218
(soft chuckle)

06:34.769 --> 06:37.105
I can't, Denny.
I have a meeting with Clarence.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.149
-I don't want Sack defending me.
-He won the last time.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.943
Exactly. He'll expect me to be grateful.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.904
The bank is trying to take Clarence's
house away. I told him I'd help.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.408
But as for you, I thought you agreed
to stop shooting people.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.701
-He's an environmentalist.
-Even so.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.080
You were hoping to get called
on Shirley's carpet again, weren't you?

06:54.163 --> 06:56.582
-That's what this was about.
-No, no, I really wanted to shoot him.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.625
-(Alan chuckles)
-Alan?

06:58.251 --> 07:01.379
(sighs) Your best defense here, Denny,
is remorse, contrition.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.048
You need to look past the fact
that he's an environmentalist

07:04.132 --> 07:08.052
and see him as the terrible golfer
you've always loved to beat and apologize.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.095
Come on, Clarence.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.644
-He shot him with a gun?
-Paint ball. He does that.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.063
(scoffs) And now he's being sued.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.567
Ugh. You know, I've learned,
when looking for you,

07:22.650 --> 07:25.194
it's best not to check your office
or your desk,

07:25.278 --> 07:28.197
-where you might actually be doing work.
-Yeah, yeah. What do you need?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.783
Clients. They seem like nice clients.
Need you.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.369
-They're in reception, waiting.
-Can't you get somebody else?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.205
Fine.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.333
Nice suit.

07:41.002 --> 07:45.214
Katie, you'll be joining me in defense
of both the firm and Denny Crane,

07:45.298 --> 07:48.176
whose legacy continues to grow
yet more colorful.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.052
My office, please.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.973
Well, seems the paint ball assassin
is now--

07:54.891 --> 07:57.685
-Jerry, what's wrong?
-I got dumped.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.353
I'm sorry?

08:00.062 --> 08:04.358
It's a Dear John letter from Leigh.
She's leaving me for an iPhone.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.156
CARL (clears throat): Well, first of all,
and it goes without saying,

08:10.615 --> 08:13.451
Denny is very sorry
for shooting the paint ball gun.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.369
Well, that's interesting
because, until now,

08:15.453 --> 08:17.622
it has gone without saying.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.916
-Girl.
-CARL: Denny?

08:20.583 --> 08:21.667
What do you have to say?

08:23.252 --> 08:26.506
-I'm sorry.
-No, you're not, Denny.

08:27.215 --> 08:31.219
And the truth is, I don't really care,
not about the paint ball.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.889
-But I do care about the environment.
-(snores)

08:34.972 --> 08:37.725
And it is embarrassing to me
as a board member of Green People

08:37.808 --> 08:39.519
to look around this office

08:40.353 --> 08:43.189
and see it lit up
like a nuclear power plant.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.191
Wasteful Christmas decorations.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.443
You make no effort whatsoever
to conserve energy.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.822
And this, at a time when carbon dioxide
is poisoning the planet,

08:51.906 --> 08:52.990
glaciers are melting--

08:53.074 --> 08:54.575
-(air gun shoots)
-(Walt groans softly)

09:00.081 --> 09:02.416
Is it overzealous on my part?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.710
-Maybe. But all it takes-- Ow!
-(air gun shoots)

09:05.169 --> 09:07.880
Damn it. Something keeps hitting me
in the face and it hurts.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.468
Why don't, um, we take a break
and let cooler heads prevail?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.594
-Denny--
-Ow!

09:15.179 --> 09:16.138
You're shooting me.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.599
Ah, it's an Airsoft gun.
Don't be such a girl.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.726
-Obnoxious!
-WOMAN: Oh! Hey!

09:20.810 --> 09:21.686
Sick!

09:22.812 --> 09:25.898
Second Amendment. He was attacking me.
I have a right to defend myself.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.025
Don't I?

09:35.616 --> 09:38.494
Nobody is more devastated about this
than I am.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.495
Yes.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.872
I personally executed
Mr. Bell's mortgage agreement.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.626
I take enormous pride
in being able to help people buy homes,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.504
and I was extremely gratified
to be able to help Mr. Bell buy his.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.923
And I'm deeply saddened for him
to be losing it.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.218
Yes. Is it any consolation
that you're the one taking it?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.095
(scoffs) I wanted this to work.

09:56.721 --> 10:01.017
We gave Mr. Bell a no-money-down,
interest-only two-year ARM at two percent.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.768
It was a fantastic opportunity.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.270
Mr. Chernack, I'm in a bit of a rush,

10:04.353 --> 10:05.771
so, if you don't mind,
I'd like to cut the crap.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.232
As much as you desperately want
the best for Clarence,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.067
it seems that you've done him
the very worst.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.487
You facilitated his buying a house
he ultimately couldn't afford.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.658
You then continued to raise his rates,
what was once two percent is now 12,

10:17.742 --> 10:19.201
with a balloon payment coming due.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.830
And in the end, it seems the bank
gets all the money and the house.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.000
And instead of the best,
Clarence gets nothing.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.210
I take offense to that.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.005
-(chuckles)
-This man wanted this property,

10:31.088 --> 10:33.341
-and I made it happen for him.
-Oh, my goodness.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.802
Let's hear it for Mr. Chernack,
this year's MVP

10:36.886 --> 10:38.179
in the predatory lending department!

10:38.262 --> 10:39.930
-Shh, shh, shh!
-I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.307
No, no, don't be silly.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.934
Just celebrating Mr. Chernack's success

10:44.018 --> 10:47.104
with this subprime mortgage scam
you're currently offering.

10:47.188 --> 10:51.025
-And you are?
-Alan Shore, representing the scammee.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.443
May we go to my office?

10:52.526 --> 10:55.571
Unless you're serving drinks
with your apology and refinancing offer,

10:55.655 --> 10:56.947
I think we can settle this in court.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.993
Oh, I think before we get there,
you'll wanna do your discovery,

11:01.077 --> 11:02.578
which attorneys typically do.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.248
And you'll find, Mr. Shore,
that this subprime debacle

11:06.332 --> 11:09.794
isn't just victimizing individuals
but lending institutions as well.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.756
In fact, over 160 major lenders
have been put out of business.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.176
Many others, including us,
are simply trying to survive.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.763
Our stock price has gone down
almost 95 percent.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.307
Twenty percent of the mortgages we hold
are past due.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.976
The bulk of the others
haven't had their rates reset yet.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.521
And in the next two years,
it figures to get worse.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.273
But hey, go ahead and sue us.

11:32.024 --> 11:36.028
That's what we need, for a lawyer like you
to come in and slap us around a little.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.166
-Now what?
-I don't know.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.378
We could sue, but like he said,
they've lost money, too.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.380
It's not something they wanted
to have happen.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.549
Ah, it's always the government.
Come on, Alan.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.509
This is a liberal's wet dream.

11:58.592 --> 12:01.137
You get to jump up and scream
for more regulation.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.054
Ah, yeah.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.600
Well, I've scheduled a settlement
conference with the bank's lawyer.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.810
We'll see what happens.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.813
What about your case?
What's happening there?

12:10.896 --> 12:13.733
Trial, we'll win.
Deep down, people hate the environment.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.276
I'm not sure that's true, Denny.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.611
Actions speak louder than words.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.823
Never mind what we say.
Consider what we do.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.617
It might occasion a discussion
of your actions.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.956
-Is it time for your annual CAT scan?
-Very funny.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.125
Seriously, Denny, is it time?

12:32.209 --> 12:35.337
There are these new PET scans
which are more definitive.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.382
I'm gonna make an appointment.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.314
Well, well, Alan Shore.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.108
-How the heck are you, my good buddy?
-I'm fine, thank you.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.987
A bit surprised perhaps to discover
we're buddies. But other than that--

13:00.070 --> 13:02.198
Attaboy. You're still a hoot.
That's what you are.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.743
-Melvin Palmer. How are you, my friend?
-Homeless.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.287
Well, we are gonna see
what we can do about that.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.580
That's what we're gonna do.

13:09.663 --> 13:10.706
Do you know what I like?

13:10.790 --> 13:14.710
I like to eliminate "adversary"
from the adversarial process.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.253
-That's what I like.
-Oh, dear.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.589
There is no reason
this can't be a win-win.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.967
I mean, we're not
the Japanese, now, are we?

13:22.051 --> 13:25.513
No, but I can see you're a racist
in addition to being my good buddy.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.473
You're a hoot. That's what you are.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.600
Come on. Let's all go work this out.

13:29.934 --> 13:34.522
Find a way for my friend, Clarence,
to be home for the holidays.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.856
He gets worse.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.706
Jerry, it's very difficult for me
to work at my desk

13:52.790 --> 13:54.458
knowing you're curled up under yours.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.293
JERRY: I'm fine.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.925
Have you seen those iPhones?
They're very sexy.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.635
Jerry, get up
from under your desk, please.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.471
-JERRY: I'm fine.
-Jerry, please, get up!

14:12.476 --> 14:16.981
Not to mitigate the tragedy which was once
your great love, but Leigh is--

14:17.064 --> 14:20.025
Well, I believe the American term,
a total nut job.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.904
I'm quite sympathetic to the condition
of objectophilia.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.448
But if your girlfriend cheats on you
with a clock radio

14:26.532 --> 14:28.117
and runs off with an iPhone,

14:28.200 --> 14:29.910
she's bonkers,
and you'd best be done with her.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.455
So, stop your whinging and get on with it,
would you please?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.749
It's either that,
or go outfit yourself with a nappy.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.757
Bloody hell.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.468
(indistinct chattering)

14:47.970 --> 14:50.764
Make sure he goes through the weapons
detector as we go into the courthouse.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.474
-I heard that.
-(elevator bell dings)

14:53.601 --> 14:55.895
Carl, I was in your office at six o'clock.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.231
-You were a no-show.
-I got a little tied up with Denny.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.608
Would you like that?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.068
-Let's try eleven o'clock today.
-Mm-hmm.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.655
-What's happening?
-I haven't the slightest idea.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.450
I've been summoned,
but with no indication as to my fate.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.244
I don't like that it's happening
without Shirley. Jerry.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.162
Oh, shut up.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.081
-Okay.
-Leigh dumped him.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.751
-For the clock radio?
-iPhone.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.753
They are sexy.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.257
Here's what I'm trying to do, Clarence.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.886
I'm trying to get inside your head.
It's what I like to do.

15:28.969 --> 15:32.014
See, I find the best way to help people
with a problem

15:32.097 --> 15:34.391
is to experience
where they're coming from.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.810
That suit you okay, my friend?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.604
-Uh, fine.
-Okay.

15:39.146 --> 15:42.107
Now, when Mr. Chernack
explained this loan--

15:42.191 --> 15:44.234
He didn't really explain it.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.612
Well, you went to law school.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.783
Are you telling me that you signed
a legal document without understanding it?

15:50.866 --> 15:53.243
Was it your client's intent
to take advantage of him

15:53.327 --> 15:54.578
when it turned out he didn't, Mr. Palmer?

15:54.662 --> 15:58.082
I'm sorry, Melvin.
I keep forgetting we're buddies.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.875
-You know what you are?
-A hoot.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.543
With a capital "H." That's what you are.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.296
All right, now, Clarence,
you did understand terms

16:04.380 --> 16:08.300
like "float" and "balloon" and "piggyback"

16:08.384 --> 16:11.887
and, hell, sounds like a birthday party,
that's what that does.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.807
But you did understand
that your adjustable rate

16:14.974 --> 16:16.600
floated with the prime, didn't you?

16:16.684 --> 16:19.311
I certainly had no idea the prime
would go through the roof.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.854
Well, nor did the bank.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.482
And nobody expected the housing market
to take a dive.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.777
I mean, we all got caught with our
pants down on that one, didn't we, Al?

16:26.860 --> 16:30.072
I do my best work with my pants down.
But then again, I'm the hoot.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.366
With a capital "H." That's what you are.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.534
Yeah. (chuckles)

16:39.289 --> 16:40.124
Please sit.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.343
(exhales) Well, Lorraine...

16:54.680 --> 16:56.640
I did a little survey with the firm.

16:57.349 --> 17:02.062
Between the 172 attorneys currently
practicing law at Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt,

17:02.146 --> 17:04.815
we've managed to rack up convictions

17:04.898 --> 17:09.111
in domestic violence,
possession of marijuana,

17:09.194 --> 17:11.238
cocaine, heroin, ecstasy,

17:11.321 --> 17:13.824
malicious destruction of property, DUI's,

17:13.907 --> 17:17.327
reckless driving,
and failure to file income tax returns.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.955
That doesn't even include Denny.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.500
You, on the other hand,
haven't been convicted of anything.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.129
You also seem to have led
a rather model life

17:27.212 --> 17:28.297
over the past eight years,

17:28.380 --> 17:32.426
setting aside your extracurricular
activities in elevators.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.601
Bottom line, you survive for now,
mainly because Shirley likes you.

17:41.185 --> 17:45.564
And Denny has a particular fondness
in his... heart.

17:46.815 --> 17:50.569
If this prior career should take on
a public relations life,

17:51.445 --> 17:53.238
we may have to revisit the situation.

17:54.073 --> 17:54.907
But for now...

17:56.325 --> 17:58.786
-Thank you.
-That's all.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.051
(sighs)

18:16.553 --> 18:18.597
Okay, Jerry, why are you under my desk?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.892
JERRY: I just came in to be alone.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.186
Would you like me to leave?

18:25.479 --> 18:26.313
Uh...

18:36.323 --> 18:40.911
He flies around in a private jet.
He drives a tank.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.455
This is Crane of Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.125
The firm does very little
to be truly green,

18:46.208 --> 18:48.710
and they told me they did a lot.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.045
Well, this is fraud.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.923
So, you've known Denny Crane
for a long time.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.634
You knew he flew in private jets
and so forth?

18:55.717 --> 18:59.388
True, but he told me
that he was starting to make sacrifices.

18:59.471 --> 19:03.267
More importantly, he told me
the firm was green. It's not.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.768
Fraud.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.647
First of all, I'm an enormous admirer
of your organization, Green People.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.275
-I think you're all to be congratulated.
-Well, thank you.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.486
I do notice, however,
the beverage your counsel's drinking.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.488
Do you know, sir,
that the bottled water industry

19:16.572 --> 19:20.951
uses more than 1.5 million barrels
of crude oil to manufacture their plastic?

19:21.034 --> 19:25.706
I know that we use oil to make products.
I do live in this century.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.541
They happen to use a lot of oil,

19:27.624 --> 19:30.294
enough to fuel 100,000 cars for a year.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.547
They also use vast amounts of fossil fuels
to distribute their product.

19:33.630 --> 19:37.718
What's worse is, less than 25 percent
of these bottles are actually recycled.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.554
The rest end up in landfills or the ocean.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.182
It's not really green at all
to be drinking bottled water.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.852
I'm not about to ask people to go green
at the expense of their own health.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.770
Oh, actually,
it doesn't serve their health.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.815
Scientists say that bottled water
is no better for you than tap.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.609
In fact, it could be worse.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.235
The EPA standards are looser,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.988
and in some cases,
the bacterial count is almost double.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.823
This is not a referendum on water.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.867
-I beg your pardon. Do you eat meat?
-Huh?

20:01.950 --> 20:04.453
I only ask because studies show
eating meat contributes more

20:04.536 --> 20:06.622
to greenhouse gases than driving a car.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.750
Denny says you two often
have rib eyes together, is that true?

20:09.833 --> 20:12.794
First, I don't believe that eating meat

20:12.878 --> 20:15.547
is worse for the environment
than driving a car.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.008
It is. Contaminated runoff
from slaughterhouses

20:18.091 --> 20:20.385
is a major source of water pollution.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.223
Livestock itself contributes 18 percent
of greenhouse gases

20:24.306 --> 20:25.766
just from, pardon me, farting.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.977
That's more than all the planes, trains,
and automobiles put together.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.229
Do you eat meat, sir?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.940
I'm not sitting here saying people
need to go vegan.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.401
But Denny Crane's firm
is assaulting the environment.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.613
I mean, the man drives
an outrageous gas, guzzling mon--

20:39.696 --> 20:41.114
What do you drive, if I may ask?

20:41.198 --> 20:42.866
-I drive a hybrid.
-Oh, dear.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.576
Oh, what?
Are you telling me that's bad, too?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.119
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

20:46.203 --> 20:49.665
but hybrid batteries contain nickel
that is mined and smelted

20:49.748 --> 20:51.458
in a plant in Sudbury, Ontario,

20:51.541 --> 20:55.545
a plant that has caused so much
environmental damage and acid rain,

20:55.629 --> 20:59.758
that NASA uses the so-called dead zone
around the plant to test its moon rovers.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.178
I'd think a board member of Green People
might know that.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.139
That nickel then has to be shipped off
via massive containers

21:06.223 --> 21:07.724
to a refinery in Europe,

21:07.808 --> 21:09.977
then off to China to be made
into nickel foam,

21:10.060 --> 21:11.687
then to Japan to be manufactured,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.314
then finally, all the way back to America.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.651
All that just to put
a single hybrid battery into a car.

21:17.734 --> 21:21.571
When you combine all the energy it takes
to build and drive a hybrid,

21:21.655 --> 21:25.367
it adds up to almost 50 percent more
than it does to build and drive a Hummer.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.244
They also save on fuel.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.787
KATIE: In terms of money perhaps.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.665
But because they do so,
studies show people are driving more.

21:31.748 --> 21:35.252
Hybrids might result
in more fuel consumption than gas cars.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.004
I imagine you do know that.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.715
-No?
-I love it.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.094
Sorry.

21:47.264 --> 21:50.642
My point is, you can blame us
all you want, my friend,

21:50.976 --> 21:52.436
but nobody saw this coming.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.604
Even Alan Greenspan was saying

21:54.688 --> 21:57.190
there were no bubbles
in the housing market.

21:57.274 --> 22:01.611
Is Al Greenspan your good buddy, too?
I hear he can be quite the hoot.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.740
Al, I really don't need you
to make fun of me.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.866
No, you don't.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.411
The simple fact is,
this was a negotiable contract.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.830
-He's a lawyer.
-Those are two facts actually.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.666
What happened to the subprime
was unforeseeable.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.544
What happened to the housing market
was unforeseeable.

22:17.627 --> 22:20.047
When do we get to the win-win part
of this meeting?

22:20.422 --> 22:23.091
This man was never lied to.
He made a deal.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.677
Now he doesn't like it
'cause it turned out to be a bad deal.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.929
So what, he just stops
making his payments?

22:28.263 --> 22:31.266
Seems to me, he deserves to lose a house.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.478
You think you can sue us and win, Al,

22:34.561 --> 22:36.938
even though he flat-out
breached a contract?

22:37.397 --> 22:41.276
I'm asking myself,
what kind of a lawyer would think that?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.527
That's what I ask.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.571
But then, I remember.

22:45.697 --> 22:50.702
You're not so much a lawyer
as you are a gigantic hoot.

22:51.953 --> 22:52.788
Am I right?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.751
I may not be much of a lawyer, Mr. Palmer,

22:57.834 --> 23:01.296
but I can see the obvious foreclose
on Mr. Bell's house,

23:01.380 --> 23:04.674
and your client will be left holding
an asset he can't sell

23:04.758 --> 23:06.718
and a loan that will never be paid off.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.970
Over the next 18 months,

23:09.054 --> 23:12.891
two million of these teaser mortgages
are going to expire,

23:12.974 --> 23:16.770
and a trillion dollar's worth of loans
are going to be called in.

23:16.853 --> 23:21.566
As interest rates keep ticking up
and property values keep slipping down,

23:21.650 --> 23:23.944
that trillion dollar's worth of debt
is going to be secured

23:24.027 --> 23:26.029
by houses worth a fraction of that.

23:26.113 --> 23:29.866
Keep throwing people out on the street,
taking their homes instead of their money,

23:29.950 --> 23:31.660
and you'll be left
with a stock price of zero

23:31.743 --> 23:33.662
and a public that's out for blood.

23:33.745 --> 23:39.042
Not mine or his, but yours and yours.

23:39.709 --> 23:43.255
You can smell it in the air,
anger and chaos.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.714
If Shakespeare were alive today,

23:44.798 --> 23:47.592
he might say,
"First thing, let's kill all the bankers."

23:49.344 --> 23:50.762
Tell me, Melvin,

23:50.846 --> 23:53.890
what exactly do you plan to trade on
in that courtroom?

23:54.307 --> 23:57.602
Your witless grin and home-style cooking?

23:57.894 --> 24:01.440
Or perhaps the banking industry's
stellar reputation.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.483
The FBI has already claimed
mortgage fraud

24:03.567 --> 24:06.486
is the fastest growing white-collar crime
in America.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.948
In some cities, even drug dealers
have turned to mortgage lending.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.325
Profits are high, death rate is low.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.162
Until, of course,
people start shooting the suits.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.166
I may not know much about law,

24:19.249 --> 24:21.251
but even a gigantic hoot like me knows

24:21.334 --> 24:23.587
cases always come down to emotion.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.923
Who do you think the jury's heart
will go out to on this one?

24:27.424 --> 24:31.845
I've got a man who's lost his home
and his entire life savings.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.264
You've got a bank.

24:42.689 --> 24:46.902
These images here are basically
microscopic plaques of debris,

24:47.319 --> 24:50.363
tangles of nerve endings
containing a protein called tau.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.741
Up to now, we've only been able to view

24:52.824 --> 24:54.910
these kinds of tissue tangles
in autopsies.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.870
So what are you saying? I'm dead?

24:56.953 --> 24:59.873
No, no. I'm just saying,
with the latest PET scan developments,

24:59.956 --> 25:02.334
we are now seeing things
we never thought possible.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.003
It's-it's beyond innovation.
This is really the cutting edge.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.672
Look, just tell me
what all this crap means.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.967
Well, uh, you have MCI,
but that doesn't mean--

25:11.051 --> 25:14.679
I've got AT&amp;T. I know my phone service.
I'm not that far gone.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.807
No. MCI stands
for Mild Cognitive Impairment.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.435
And this debris here
represents signs of MCI.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.771
Did I not just tell him I have AT&amp;T?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.898
So, is this Alzheimer's?

25:25.106 --> 25:27.025
Could be the early stages,
but nothing's definitive.

25:27.108 --> 25:31.613
Uh, sometimes MCI is a transition stage
between normal aging and Alzheimer's.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.365
Other times, it's just normal aging.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.243
And we see this in about 29 percent
of people under 85.

25:36.326 --> 25:40.413
Of those people, roughly 12 percent
progress to Alzheimer's each year.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.583
What do I look like, Rain Man?
Just crunch the numbers for me!

25:43.667 --> 25:47.671
Well, um, in about six years,
80 percent have Alzheimer's.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.760
So... let me understand what we have here.

25:55.845 --> 26:00.392
I have an 80 percent chance
of getting Alzheimer's in six years?

26:01.434 --> 26:02.310
Yes.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.400
If it's any consolation at all,

26:09.609 --> 26:14.906
you're 75, you drink, you smoke;
you probably won't live that long.

26:14.990 --> 26:15.824
(gasps)

26:31.840 --> 26:34.426
Denny Crane wasn't honest.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.512
He told Walter Bonner
that Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt

26:37.596 --> 26:39.097
was a green firm.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.056
It wasn't.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.685
I don't know about you, but I'm a little
sick of the widespread practice

26:43.768 --> 26:46.146
of the "tell-the-customer-
what-he-wants-to-hear,"

26:46.229 --> 26:47.939
"whatever-it-takes-to-get-
the-account" mentality."

26:48.398 --> 26:50.859
It's fraud. They're not green.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.486
It's bait and switch. It's wrong.

26:53.570 --> 26:57.616
These people need to be held accountable
for their lies and deception.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.118
You have to help hold them accountable

27:00.952 --> 27:06.333
even if my client eats meat
and I drink bottled water.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.639
It's hard to know what the hell
is good for the environment these days.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.144
One minute, we're being told,

27:26.519 --> 27:30.398
"Eat farmed salmon
to spare the wild stocks,"

27:30.482 --> 27:34.694
while another study says
that may be the worst thing we can do

27:34.778 --> 27:36.112
for the wild salmon.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.866
There's a new study out
that says people contribute more

27:39.949 --> 27:44.162
to greenhouse gas emissions
by walking than by driving,

27:44.245 --> 27:47.666
since the increased energy it takes
to walk makes people eat more,

27:47.749 --> 27:50.877
which causes the proliferation
of slaughterhouses.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.130
Ridiculous? Well, could be.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.800
Everyone talks about ethanol.

27:57.175 --> 28:02.639
Well, it turns out,
to fill one SUV with pure ethanol,

28:02.764 --> 28:05.975
would require 450 pounds of corn.

28:06.059 --> 28:11.147
Or roughly, the amount of calories
to feed a person for a year.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.691
That's just one tankful.

28:13.233 --> 28:17.320
We've heard how hybrid cars
may not be all they're cracked up to be.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.866
I mean, the information
can sometimes become so contradictory,

28:21.950 --> 28:23.660
it's confusing.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.454
And as a consequence,
it's easy to feel overwhelmed

28:26.538 --> 28:29.874
and an utter sense of futility,

28:29.958 --> 28:33.044
especially when people are running around
screaming, "The end is near!"

28:34.129 --> 28:37.173
One thing that would really be helpful
is if all the Chicken Littles

28:37.257 --> 28:39.134
would just stop yelling doom...

28:40.301 --> 28:44.764
(sighs) ...calm down and instead,
promote a little common sense.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.184
We're not gonna stop driving cars.

28:48.268 --> 28:53.189
People are not going to
give up meat or Christmas.

28:53.982 --> 28:57.694
Now, we can stop eating farmed salmon.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.614
We can recycle. We can drive less.

29:02.782 --> 29:07.328
We can use, uh, fluorescent light bulbs.
Little things.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.206
Maybe, if we get the message out,

29:10.290 --> 29:13.168
that the little things
really make a difference,

29:14.043 --> 29:15.253
we'll all start doing them.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.007
But suing people for not doing enough...

29:20.592 --> 29:21.843
that's just silly, isn't it?

29:33.396 --> 29:35.148
I wasn't listening. Any good?

29:42.530 --> 29:45.533
-KATIE: Hello, Jerry.
-Busy.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.913
Jerry?

29:51.539 --> 29:52.832
(purring)

29:54.417 --> 29:56.628
What, improper to make fun
of the disabled?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.421
You're not disabled, Jerry.

29:58.505 --> 30:01.424
You're a very abled man
who happens to have Asperger's

30:01.508 --> 30:02.675
and a few eccentric tics.

30:02.759 --> 30:06.054
But you're intelligent, you're mainstream,

30:06.137 --> 30:08.473
and when it comes
to finding a romantic partner,

30:08.890 --> 30:10.892
it's simply wrong for you
to reduce the playing field

30:10.975 --> 30:14.979
to people who suffer mental disorders,
which Leigh Swift very much does.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.940
With all due sensitivity to objectophilia,

30:17.023 --> 30:19.025
she needs serious medical attention.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.279
For God's sake, you cannot be expected
to compete with a gadget.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.659
You need to start setting your sights
a little... higher.

30:27.742 --> 30:31.162
That would make a lovely
Valentine's movie, but in the real world--

30:31.246 --> 30:33.540
In the real world, women fall in love
with men who beat them,

30:33.623 --> 30:34.791
men fall in love with their mothers.

30:34.874 --> 30:39.295
Love is the most inexplicable,
unscientific, irrational of all phenomena.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.340
The only thing we know for sure
is it can happen to anyone.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.508
It usually does.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.761
For you to be moping around
with the idea it never will for you

30:47.345 --> 30:48.555
is simply unacceptable.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.314
-Okay.
-Okay. Fine.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.693
Actually, I'm writing a letter
to Leigh now to get closure.

31:01.776 --> 31:02.610
Excellent.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.237
I thought it best to keep it short,

31:04.320 --> 31:05.989
but I'm wondering
if it's a little too short.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.740
-May I read it to you?
-Of course.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.909
(Katie clears throat)

31:12.287 --> 31:16.916
"Dear Leigh, go to hell.
Sincerely, Jerry."

31:21.337 --> 31:22.338
It is a bit short.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.512
This offer in no way represents
any admission of liability on our part,

31:29.596 --> 31:33.933
but rather the charity that runs
to my client's heart,

31:34.225 --> 31:36.144
to the Christmas season itself.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.270
Ooh, Santa.

31:38.521 --> 31:41.357
If your client brings
his payment schedule current,

31:41.441 --> 31:43.860
we will hold off on foreclosure.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.654
-Rejected.
-MELVIN: What?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.781
This... This is a gift.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.408
Because you're my buddy, yes.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.202
And since no gift should go unpunished,
these are the terms.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.830
He gets 60 days
to bring his scheduled payments current,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.166
and from thereon,
he gets a fixed rate at eight.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.543
Eight? Why on earth would we agree--

32:00.627 --> 32:01.628
Because you gave him two

32:02.170 --> 32:04.130
with the implied promise
it would fluctuate,

32:04.213 --> 32:05.798
but certainly not detonate.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.259
-I'm sorry. That--
-Not nearly as sorry

32:08.343 --> 32:10.803
as you'll be if you take your chances
with me in court.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.641
-My friend--
-I am not your friend.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.561
I find the possibility
of such a friendship vile.

32:19.646 --> 32:23.024
Your best hope, Mr. Milk,
is that the first subprime lawsuit

32:23.107 --> 32:25.193
is brought against you
by a buffoon like Mr. Palmer.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.696
You do not want the precedent
set by me because I will get you.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.449
Search my eyes, Mr. Milk.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.202
This is what the truth looks like.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.292
-Nine percent.
-Let's split the difference.

32:41.376 --> 32:42.335
Call it eight.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.882
-Make the deal.
-Oh, Norris, I assure you--

32:47.966 --> 32:49.175
Make the deal!

32:54.430 --> 32:56.432
You have some dog doo on your shoe.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.062
Okay, Clarence. Don't you try anything.

Can you imagine the nerve of that doctor

36:25.683 --> 36:28.394
telling me I wouldn't live long enough
to get Alzheimer's?

36:29.478 --> 36:31.439
I'll make it. You watch.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.318
What are the odds of somebody
getting mad cow and Alzheimer's?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.487
Right. (chuckles)

36:38.571 --> 36:40.656
See? Now I feel good.

36:41.449 --> 36:44.744
I think it's good to live life as though
it were a finite thing, 'cause it is.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.371
I appreciate today.

36:49.081 --> 36:54.503
And tomorrow, I'll wake up,
and there'll be another day to savor.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.009
And after it, I'll go to bed,
and I'll wake up, and there'll be another.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.596
Another and another and a...

37:07.433 --> 37:10.853
Besides, I can reverse this, uh,

37:11.562 --> 37:13.439
MCI thing anytime I want.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.858
-You can?
-DENNY: I-I read a study.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.402
Blood goes to your brain,
blood goes to your penis,

37:18.486 --> 37:19.612
but not at the same time.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.699
So, if I wanna hone my mental skills,
I just cut down on the sex.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.994
Question is, is it really worth it?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.249
-I think Plato once asked that.
-(Denny chuckles)

37:32.208 --> 37:34.293
Ah. (chuckles)

37:34.377 --> 37:36.671
Don't you love Christmas?

37:36.754 --> 37:38.798
(siren wailing in the distance)

37:39.298 --> 37:42.009
Anything goes wrong in the world,
Christmas makes it go away.

37:43.177 --> 37:46.597
Decorations, carols...

37:48.391 --> 37:49.225
tree.

37:51.143 --> 37:56.190
I don't tell this to many people,
but I once had sex with a Christmas tree.

37:58.109 --> 37:58.985
Not a real tree.

38:00.027 --> 38:01.112
When I was in college,

38:01.195 --> 38:04.615
my parents had one of those
Christmas masquerade party things.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.703
And, um, Diana Korolog,
I think I've mentioned her to you.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.414
She brought her slutty cousin along,

38:11.497 --> 38:16.127
and-and she was
dressed so beautifully in uh...

38:16.460 --> 38:18.504
She had the popcorn strings around her,

38:18.587 --> 38:22.591
and icicles, and candy cane from both...

38:24.927 --> 38:26.012
She was magic.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.558
So, up to the room.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.145
And my mother walked in
and caught me humping a tree.

38:34.228 --> 38:35.730
(both chuckle)

38:36.105 --> 38:36.939
That was trouble.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.775
And she was already mad at me
for sucking face

38:39.859 --> 38:41.610
with the Virgin Mary under a mistletoe.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.362
(both laughing)

38:43.446 --> 38:46.032
That was a tough party. (laughs)

38:48.993 --> 38:53.247
-Have you bought my present yet?
-Well, it's still a little early.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.125
-I know what I want.
-Tell me.

38:56.834 --> 39:00.921
Well, I saw you dancing close
with Lorraine.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.965
A lot closer than I'll ever get.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.550
But I've resigned myself to that.

39:05.551 --> 39:10.264
And her perfume rubbed off on you.
I can smell it from here.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.767
And?

39:14.018 --> 39:16.145
Alan, can I smell you?

39:16.228 --> 39:17.063
(scoffs)

39:20.149 --> 39:22.485
-That's all you want for Christmas?
-Please.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.157
-Better not try anything.
-I won't!

39:28.657 --> 39:31.118
I just want to drink her in a little.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.207
-And pretend.
-(chuckles)

39:38.751 --> 39:40.544
(sniffs) Mm. Oh, my.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.381
What's this perfume on you?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.758
It's, uh, one of the go-go dancers.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.552
-Mm. It's very good.
-Mm.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.222
-Wow.
-Alan, don't talk.

39:51.305 --> 39:54.934
It makes it harder to pretend
you're Lorraine.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.269
Did she say what it was, this go-go girl?

39:57.353 --> 39:59.522
Smell all you want, Alan. Just don't talk.

Which is it? Her or me? Me or her?

40:59.957 --> 41:02.918
This is a first-degree murder trial.
Are you even remotely prepared?

41:03.335 --> 41:07.506

have your day in court.
