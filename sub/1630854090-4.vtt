00:08.583 --> 00:11.083
Beatrix has been missing
for three days.

00:12.625 --> 00:15.833
And that's my responsibility,
not her guardian's?

00:17.291 --> 00:20.291
I've spoken to the mayor.
He'll let us know if she turns up.

00:20.375 --> 00:24.458
We should be looking for her,
with every resource at our disposal.

00:24.541 --> 00:28.750
-If the Blood Witches have her--
-That's exactly what they would expect.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.166
For us to react.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.375
So they can pick off fairies one by one.

00:33.458 --> 00:36.375
If they want fairies,
why don't we give them one?

00:37.291 --> 00:41.208
A trade. I could text Beatrix's phone.
Offer them another fairy.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.833
Because we have history,
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.000
She's like a daughter to me.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.291
Andreas,

00:58.208 --> 01:01.083
I told you
not to form emotional attachments.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.583
This is why.

01:06.208 --> 01:09.041
Marco,
just the man I was looking for.

01:09.125 --> 01:12.458
Good timing. Tell me you've got
something to save me from grading.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.708
Well, actually, I do.

01:16.791 --> 01:19.166
Andreas!

01:19.250 --> 01:20.916
Andreas, what the--

01:24.916 --> 01:26.250
I'm sorry, Marco.

01:28.791 --> 01:30.125
It's you or her.

01:52.291 --> 01:55.125
Wanna take bets
on when the staring's gonna stop?

01:55.208 --> 01:58.083
Look, the Dragon Flame's a legend.
Now you are too.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.375
I give it at least a week
before they get bored.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.583
Is this an eight? Eighty-something?

02:02.666 --> 02:04.500
Are those waves?

02:05.416 --> 02:06.666
Eight waves?

02:08.083 --> 02:08.958
BW.

02:09.791 --> 02:11.875
-Blood Witches.
-Oh.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.333
-You didn't do the reading!
-I've been swimming a lot.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.541
Is that what they're calling it? Swimming?

02:18.208 --> 02:20.208
What's, uh, Grey's favorite stroke?

02:21.291 --> 02:22.125
Butterfly.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.000
And I know about Blood Witches.

02:25.083 --> 02:27.291
They aren't super common,
but they are a thing.

02:27.375 --> 02:28.583
I assumed I could wing it.

02:28.666 --> 02:31.583
My handwriting is not that bad.
Let me see.

02:34.166 --> 02:35.791
No. Uh, Blood Witch powers.

02:35.875 --> 02:39.791
Basically, their element is blood,
so they can control muscles and bones.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.916
Theirs and other people's. Creepy.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.375
And now, apparently,
they steal magic from fairies. Creepier.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.166
It'll be quick. Promise.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.083
-We have this joke about a hawk--
-You told me. It's cute.

02:53.166 --> 02:56.291
What's not cute is you not doing well
on this quiz and sulking after.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.208
So get to the Dominion Wars section.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.666
Back then, Blood Witches
were so powerful that they--

03:01.750 --> 03:04.041
Could control people's bodies
from miles away.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.875
Yeah, that much I remember.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.291
Apparently, the Dominion Wars were
the last time the Dragon Flame existed.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.875
-It's been dormant for a thousand years.
-So, it's not hereditary?

03:20.625 --> 03:23.833
Rosalind thinks that it surfaces
in times of great conflict.

03:23.916 --> 03:25.750
Because that's not ominous at all.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.750
-I know she's still shady, but she--
-She's still shady.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.500
But we want the same thing.

03:31.583 --> 03:34.583
Find the Blood Witch stealing fairy magic
and stop them.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.083
You and Flora saw the scraper up close.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.416
Look, shady or not, I'm just…

03:41.000 --> 03:43.250
I'm happy we have Rosalind
to help fight them.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.000
We don't know much
about scrapers.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.583
We do know that fairy magic
is ineffective against them,

03:50.458 --> 03:55.291
which is why now is the time
when the Specialists must shine.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.333
Now that I'm back,
I'll be taking over ranged combat,

03:58.416 --> 04:00.541
the primary method
of taking down scrapers.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.166
Let's see what you got.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.333
It's like he never fucking left.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.958
Come on, man.
Aren't we over this anti-Silva shit?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.875
He acts like he has
the moral high ground. Hypocrite.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.541
What, and you'd prefer Andreas?

04:14.625 --> 04:18.166
-At least Andreas is who he is.
-Yes, and who he is is a massive prick.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.833
He almost took my arm off
in sparring yesterday.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.041
I wonder if it's because Beatrix is gone.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.875
I heard Rosalind sent her on a mission,
but when I tried to ask him,

04:27.958 --> 04:30.125
he pretty much told me to fuck off, so…

04:30.208 --> 04:32.375
You don't know anything, do you, Riven?

04:32.458 --> 04:33.583
Nope.

04:33.666 --> 04:36.833
She's not my problem anymore.
That nightmare is over.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.500
-For homing arrows, these fucking suck.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.125
What was that, Riven?

04:50.208 --> 04:53.583
Combat won't be as easy
as hitting a single target.

04:53.666 --> 04:57.416
The Blood Witches and the scrapers
will attack together.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.208
Mind fairies can protect
Specialists from Blood Witch magic.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.458
Musa.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.375
Can I just watch? My magic
hasn't been very helpful recently.

05:06.458 --> 05:11.333
You're the strongest mind fairy here.
Your magic is limited only by your will.

05:11.416 --> 05:12.666
Focus.

05:21.916 --> 05:23.041
Got him.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.541
Protect him while I simulate an attack.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.625
I can feel you, Musa.
Push me away.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.083
Told you. Not helpful.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.000
Just like that attitude.

05:48.833 --> 05:49.833
Who's next?

05:54.083 --> 05:56.125
I wonder what it evolved from.

05:56.208 --> 06:00.583
It's got sensing organs, an exoskeleton.
Maybe a jellyfish? Crustacean?

06:00.666 --> 06:03.666
Maybe it didn't evolve
'cause it's from the Realm of Darkness,

06:03.750 --> 06:04.833
whatever that is.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.291
Help organize this before LeRoy checks in.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.791
I don't want her thinking
the Harveys are slobs.

06:09.875 --> 06:12.750
I can't believe Aimee LeRoy
is gonna be the new professor.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.333
My parents are obsessed with her.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.500
Yeah, my dad too. It's gonna be so weird
without him and Sam.

06:18.541 --> 06:20.166
How's Musa handling it?

06:21.041 --> 06:22.166
Not sure.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.666
Must be… difficult for her,
knowing that she's the reason he left.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.583
I'm not saying anything Musa doesn't know.

06:30.666 --> 06:33.333
If I can sense you're mad at her,
she can too.

06:33.416 --> 06:35.375
Well, I can't change how I feel. Sorry.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.833
She's at the Bastion, right?
I'll go check on her.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.625
I have to head over there anyway.

06:42.708 --> 06:45.625
-Why are you going to the Bastion?
-Gonna meet a friend.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.166
A friend? What friend?

06:48.250 --> 06:51.000
I know all your friends,
and they live in the suite, so…

06:51.083 --> 06:52.000
Riven.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.916
I'm gonna meet up with Riven.
We hung out after the banquet.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.500
Course, that makes sense.
Totally makes sense.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.000
Uh, I guess, tell Riven I said hi.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.000
Hey.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.666
What are you doing here?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.291
Uh, my mum said
she was sending me a little something,

07:23.375 --> 07:25.375
so I was just seeing if it came in.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.291
Good afternoon, Headmistress.

07:35.541 --> 07:37.250
How was the Blood Witch quiz?

07:37.833 --> 07:40.375
Uh, it was… it was easy.

07:41.583 --> 07:44.541
But I've got vested interest
considering the Blood Witches

07:44.625 --> 07:47.208
are the people who kidnapped me
when I was a baby.

07:47.291 --> 07:51.208
I also studied the reports you did
on the fairies who were drained.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.458
It took me three days to get through,
and I'm just reading it.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.500
How have you had time to do this
and run a school?

07:57.583 --> 07:58.875
Sleep is for the weak.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.958
What we're doing here
matters to the entire Otherworld.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.000
I make time.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.750
And if you want to have an impact,
you'll need to do the same.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.750
I'm headed for the Capitol.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.208
If I were you,
I'd take another look at those reports.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.958
When are we going after them?
The Blood Witches?

08:16.041 --> 08:20.125
-You said they'd know where I came from.
-When the time is right.

08:26.791 --> 08:30.291
You are our most valuable resource.
I need you safe.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.958
The Blood Witches
haven't come for you yet, but they will.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.750
And if they do…

08:40.750 --> 08:42.416
I have the Dragon Flame.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.458
The Dragon Flame won't protect you
from a knife in the back.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.041
Blood Witches fight dirty.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.916
I trust you'll keep this between us,
but…

08:54.875 --> 08:57.625
…Beatrix was taken
the night of the banquet.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.750
What?! Why didn't you tell anyone?

09:00.833 --> 09:03.708
We think it's a Blood Witch
inside our school.

09:03.791 --> 09:06.166
If we're right, they're making a move,

09:06.250 --> 09:10.333
but we can't react until we know more,
which is why I'm going to the Capitol.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.875
You don't think anyone in the school
should know a student is missing?

09:13.958 --> 09:16.458
No, because people are irrational.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.125
<i>They act on emotion.</i>

09:20.583 --> 09:22.708
<i>And emotion is good for one thing.</i>

09:23.583 --> 09:24.666
Magic.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.958
So you need to sit tight, stay quiet,

09:28.541 --> 09:30.791
<i>and contemplate your lesson for today.</i>

09:35.333 --> 09:37.875
Never let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.833
Terra, did you say something?

09:49.916 --> 09:51.208
Hair up or down?

09:52.083 --> 09:53.000
Anyone?

09:54.166 --> 09:55.166
Up?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.291
-Down?
-I'm sure it looks fine, Terra.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.250
So, you can hear me?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.833
Ah, great, new opinion.
Fun, right?

10:02.916 --> 10:05.416
Like I've not tried too hard,
but I've still tried.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.125
-Like a cool half-try. What do you think?
-Yeah, it's cute.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.958
-I'm confused.
-Oh, um, word is Rosalind's out today.

10:13.041 --> 10:16.208
So we're gonna hit up a pub in Blackbridge
called The Grapevine.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.000
-We?
-Yes, we.

10:18.083 --> 10:21.500
As in, this week has been a lot
and <i>we</i> could use a break. You especially.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.458
Aren't you forgetting the Blood Witch?

10:23.541 --> 10:26.291
Aren't you forgetting
that we're powerful fairies

10:26.375 --> 10:28.750
who won't let fear stop us
from living our lives?

10:28.833 --> 10:30.416
Also, we have the Dragon Flame.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.000
Also, it's a pub.
Lots of people around. Super safe.

10:33.083 --> 10:35.041
You're last, Bloom. Go get ready.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.125
Stella? Do you care to add to the chorus?

10:38.208 --> 10:41.458
As if I'm giving the commoners
the satisfaction of seeing a princess

10:41.541 --> 10:43.208
in a gross, dingy pub.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.333
Have fun.

10:44.416 --> 10:46.166
You're missing out.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.208
One, two,

10:58.333 --> 10:59.458
three.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.333
Hmm!

11:07.416 --> 11:08.666
I'm drinking.

11:08.750 --> 11:09.833
Oh!

11:10.625 --> 11:13.375
Cheap alcohol mixed
with different cheap alcohol.

11:15.708 --> 11:20.125
Uh, continue drinking and… and just…
and picture me drinking with you.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.875
Yeah, I'm gonna go find Riven.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.166
He's usually vomiting
in a corner about now.

11:28.666 --> 11:30.375
Okay, ladies.

11:30.458 --> 11:34.083
Figured you for an IPA kinda girl.
Yeah? Crisp, packs a punch.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.833
Stout for the mind fairy.

11:36.916 --> 11:39.833
Smooth, take your mind off
all the emotional shit.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.125
Thanks, Riv.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.416
For you Terra, cider.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.625
It's got a bit of alcohol, but basically
just a fizzy glass of apple juice.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.500
-Mm.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.375
That's really lovely. Thank you.

11:51.458 --> 11:55.166
I'm not gonna tell you how beautiful
you look 'cause that would be cringey.

11:55.250 --> 11:59.125
Telling me you're not gonna tell me
might actually make it cringier, FYI.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.125
Right, okay.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.833
-So I… heard Aimee LeRoy made it in.

12:06.958 --> 12:09.166
Exciting. She's a ledge.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.500
Yeah, so's my dad.
Shame him and Sam had to leave.

12:16.666 --> 12:19.208
I… I'm gonna go and get some napkins.

12:19.291 --> 12:20.583
Oh, okay, yeah.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.541
Okay. That…

12:42.208 --> 12:45.291
<i>I cannot imagine</i>
<i>why you'd be calling and not texting.</i>

12:47.083 --> 12:49.166
Yeah, figured this was a long shot.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.750
I couldn't find your whiskey.

12:52.791 --> 12:55.791
I did, however, find your Crocs,

12:56.458 --> 12:59.875
but I'll reserve that "I told you so"
until you get back.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.625
I know that your mission for Rosalind
is top secret,

13:03.708 --> 13:05.541
but, uh, I hope it's going well.

13:07.791 --> 13:10.833
Sorry for the rather pathetic voicemail.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.708
Um, just… call me back

13:15.291 --> 13:16.583
or text me.

13:17.791 --> 13:20.416
I know you're gonna hate me
for saying this, but, um,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.000
I'm worried about you.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.083
Someone is starting early.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.166
When I asked you to meet me,
you promised not to tell Silva.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.041
Your secret's safe with me.
It's from my time at Alfea.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.833
Andreas would call me
a fucknut Specialist all day,

13:39.916 --> 13:42.708
so I'd come here
and drown my sorrows all night.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.291
I was, by the way, a fucknut.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.666
You really hate him, don't you?

13:49.750 --> 13:51.833
Andreas is a bully. I hate bullies.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.666
Anyway, I come bearing gifts.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.583
That is a lot of paper.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.166
It's a big catering company.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.291
You really think that's how
the Blood Witches got in?

14:05.375 --> 14:07.375
-Mm-hmm.
-Through catering?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.750
If a Blood Witch
took your friend, then yeah.

14:09.833 --> 14:13.750
Think about it. Caterers are everywhere.
They're practically invisible.

14:13.833 --> 14:17.708
I mean, I pulled background
on all employees plus contractors.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.541
We can cross-reference between Beatrix
and the fairies who got their magic taken,

14:21.625 --> 14:23.375
and see if there are any links.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.208
I guess it's a… good place to start.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.375
I'll get on it now.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.250
"Now" as in at the pub?

14:31.916 --> 14:32.750
Mm-hmm.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.375
All right, so, um…

14:34.458 --> 14:38.083
I do not condone underage drinking.
Never. Wouldn't think about it.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.000
But I equally do not condone

14:40.083 --> 14:43.541
sitting in a pub avoiding your friends
and doing work.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.875
I'm the only fairy
that can take on a Blood Witch,

14:49.958 --> 14:51.666
and I have a history with them.

14:55.166 --> 14:58.375
Just… I gotta stay clear.
They don't even know about Beatrix yet.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.958
-I don't know how they're gonna react.
-I get it.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.541
-You're the only one I can tell.
-Totally.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.083
But you're also a fucking teenager, Bloom.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.166
Don't forget that.

15:13.208 --> 15:17.333
I gotta run,
but put all her drinks on my tab.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.666
Get drunk. Act your age.

15:21.958 --> 15:22.958
Have fun.

15:24.375 --> 15:25.208
Bloom.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.166
No?

15:38.833 --> 15:42.166
I know this place is very romantic
and definitely doesn't reek,

15:42.250 --> 15:43.833
but do you wanna get out of here?

15:43.916 --> 15:46.208
There's a place nearby
that I wanna show you.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.416
I should stay. My friends--

15:48.500 --> 15:51.958
All have their own stuff going on,
and you're allowed to have yours too.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.666
Thank you. This is the nicest thing
you've ever done for me.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.125
Well, I thought that's
what we were doing today. Acting nice.

16:07.708 --> 16:11.125
Flora's my best friend,
so if you do anything to hurt her--

16:11.208 --> 16:13.375
Relax. We're just having a bit of fun.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.541
Except you don't just have fun.
You ruin people.

16:18.375 --> 16:19.541
I know that firsthand.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.791
And before you say you've changed,

16:21.875 --> 16:24.375
I don't know what happened
between you, Dane, and Beatrix,

16:24.458 --> 16:28.125
but I have a feeling it'll take more than
a new boyfriend for him to get over it.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.125
I've been nothing but nice to him.

16:30.208 --> 16:33.625
-I was clear about what it was.
-Yeah, you were just having fun, right?

16:38.333 --> 16:39.333
See you around.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.416
-Sorry.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.791
It's pathetic, I know.

16:48.416 --> 16:51.125
I'm the strongest Specialist
dating the hottest one,

16:51.208 --> 16:52.375
but one look from Riven--

16:52.458 --> 16:54.333
You don't have to say it. I can feel it.

16:54.416 --> 16:57.250
Relationships are tough.
Don't let it get to you.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.583
Back at ya.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.000
I heard what happened with Sam.

17:02.083 --> 17:06.291
I'm sure Terra's already blaming you,
but don't join her. It's not your fault.

17:06.833 --> 17:10.000
Sure about that? 'Cause my magic's
actually the reason he left.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.250
Mind magic must be so fucking hard.
Dealing with everyone's emotions.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.750
I can barely deal with my own.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.416
Today at the Bastion, I felt you.
You were crystal clear.

17:17.916 --> 17:19.666
That's why I love training so much.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.375
Right? You don't think,
you don't feel, you just do.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.708
You should try it.

17:24.791 --> 17:28.083
And I don't mean training.
I mean just get out of your head.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.916
Kind of impossible for a mind fairy
to get out of their head.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.958
I could feel you too, you know?
This morning.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.666
Rosalind is the strongest mind fairy
in the Otherworld,

17:42.750 --> 17:44.375
and you almost blocked her.

17:44.958 --> 17:46.083
You're powerful, Musa,

17:46.166 --> 17:49.375
and once you're in a situation
where you act on instinct,

17:49.458 --> 17:50.708
you'll realize that.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.625
Apologies
for the cloak-and-dagger.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.291
Not sure how paranoid we should be.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.708
-Still no word on Beatrix?
-No.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.458
I was hoping one of your old
Blood Witch contacts might know more.

18:06.541 --> 18:09.958
I ran the banquet guest list by them.
Nobody of interest.

18:10.041 --> 18:14.375
But my contacts are old guard.
None of them want to fight with fairies.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.166
-Somebody does.
-Clearly.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.791
Whoever's summoning the scrapers
is using them to agitate.

18:22.625 --> 18:26.333
To let the next generation know
that the Blood Witches are back.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.166
Hammerström was killed last night.

18:30.125 --> 18:34.000
Whoever the new faction is,
they're powerful and they're making moves.

18:47.833 --> 18:50.833
Marco is
the most powerful air fairy at Alfea.

18:50.916 --> 18:52.125
He's yours.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.083
I just need to know where Beatrix is.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.291
That could be arranged.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.166
Tell me where she is.

19:06.875 --> 19:11.000
And if you so much as think about
doing weird Blood Witch shit, you're dead.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.083
That would be scary

19:13.583 --> 19:15.708
if this loser were actually a Blood Witch.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.833
I'm sorry, Little Storm.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.416
<i>Any idea</i>
<i>how dangerous it is out there?</i>

19:52.500 --> 19:55.875
-Oh yeah, it's… it's terrifying.
-<i>I want you back before sundown.</i>

19:55.958 --> 19:58.000
-Or what?
-<i>Excuse me?</i>

19:59.416 --> 20:00.958
Trying to figure out the consequence.

20:01.041 --> 20:05.458
Will it be a Silva-style lecture
or a Rosalind-style torture?

20:05.541 --> 20:07.916
It's hard to nail down
your moral center lately.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.250
<i>Sky, whatever your feelings</i>
<i>are towards me, put them aside.</i>

20:11.333 --> 20:13.500
<i>You're speaking</i>
<i>to your commanding officer.</i>

20:13.583 --> 20:15.500
I'll be back at a reasonable hour.

20:18.666 --> 20:21.541
-That was a bit harsh.
-Yeah, I know. I know.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.000
But I finally feel like my own person.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.458
I was free.

20:27.916 --> 20:29.250
And now he's back.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.958
Don't you think
he's just looking out for you?

20:34.041 --> 20:36.500
Worried Andreas wouldn't be
the person you needed.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.916
So, he scared him away?

20:39.291 --> 20:41.916
Andreas has barely said anything to me
since the banquet.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.708
Right when I was… starting to get him.

20:46.791 --> 20:49.541
I don't think Andreas's mood
has anything to do with you and Silva.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.625
Really? Why?

20:55.708 --> 20:58.041
If I've learned anything
working with Rosalind,

20:58.125 --> 21:02.125
it's that things are just…
more complicated than they seem.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.458
That does sound like Rosalind.

21:12.666 --> 21:14.333
-You know what?
-What?

21:15.333 --> 21:19.250
I think you're right.
I think we need to just… let loose.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.000
-Let loose?
-Mm-hmm.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.625
Oh. Okay. That kind of let loose.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.083
-Well, the dance party's begun.
-Do you wanna go back?

22:10.583 --> 22:12.875
If I did, I'd have ten minutes of fun.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.958
-Then somebody would get too drunk.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.875
I'd feel I have to wrangle the group.
They'd get mad at me for ruining the fun.

22:18.958 --> 22:21.000
I'd get mad at myself
for that bothering me,

22:21.083 --> 22:22.708
then we'd all go to sleep angry.

22:22.791 --> 22:25.666
So, do you wanna go back or not?

22:26.583 --> 22:28.916
-'Cause that sounds lovely.

22:30.666 --> 22:33.166
I'm more of an acquaintance guy
than a friend guy.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.958
It's easier to go after what I want
when not worried about others.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.041
-What is it that you want?
-I mean, you're here, aren't you?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.625
Wait. Was that creepy?
That was meant to be sweet. Shit.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.625
That depends on where you're taking me.
Murder shed. Creepy.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.833
Hidden glade?

22:47.958 --> 22:49.208
Very sweet.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.875
-Hey, you good?
-Mm-hmm.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.750
Oof! You're not a good liar.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.875
Is this where the bad boy
offers the new girl a hit?

23:15.375 --> 23:17.708
Nah, new girl would say no.

23:18.458 --> 23:22.291
Or new girl's friends would find out.
Either way, drama waiting to happen.

23:25.041 --> 23:28.083
-What did she say to you?
-More drama waiting to happen.

23:28.916 --> 23:31.708
Here you are. How do we feel about darts?
Me and Kat versus--

23:31.791 --> 23:33.041
What did you say to him?

23:36.125 --> 23:38.166
You just couldn't
leave it alone, could you?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.291
I didn't say anything.

23:42.666 --> 23:44.250
Ta-da.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.666
Drama.

23:50.833 --> 23:53.916
I was just looking out for you.
He's not a good guy.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.333
According to who? You?

23:56.416 --> 23:58.791
No. Like, objectively. Trust me.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.916
Even if that were true,
who the hell cares?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.666
I'm not proposing to him.
We're literally just friends hanging out.

24:05.416 --> 24:06.875
I know you, Flora.

24:06.958 --> 24:09.500
Course you do.
'Cause you know everything, right?

24:17.416 --> 24:19.208
-<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

24:26.708 --> 24:30.625
<i> The ruin she's talking about</i>
<i>is this abandoned lodge outside of town.</i>

24:30.708 --> 24:32.875
Yeah. It's an old townie hang out.

24:32.958 --> 24:36.166
Remember the summer we found
beer bottles and the creepy doll?

24:36.250 --> 24:38.333
The Specialists are wasted,
but I could grab--

24:38.416 --> 24:40.916
Nobody's grabbing anyone
or going anywhere.

24:41.458 --> 24:42.708
Guys, this is a trap.

24:43.708 --> 24:46.458
-<i>You don't know that.</i>
Stella, you're not thinking clearly.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.416
<i>Nobody's seen Beatrix for days,</i>
<i>Rosalind leaves</i>

24:49.500 --> 24:52.000
and suddenly you're getting a text
asking for help.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.958
-How does that make sense?
-It does look a bit suspicious.

24:55.041 --> 24:57.041
I don't care. We have to do something.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.916
We'll tell Rosalind, but, um…

25:00.958 --> 25:05.208
I know for a fact she is at the Capitol
because she's handling this.

25:06.333 --> 25:07.416
How do you know that?

25:11.166 --> 25:13.333
Rosalind told me
that Beatrix was kidnapped.

25:13.416 --> 25:15.333
-What?!
-Bloom!

25:15.416 --> 25:18.083
She told me not to tell anyone.
She didn't want panic.

25:18.166 --> 25:21.000
We're all a little drunk.
This isn't a good time to make decisions.

25:21.083 --> 25:25.125
Let's just go back to the suite,
and we… we'll figure it out there, okay?

25:26.625 --> 25:27.750
I'm sorry.

25:29.166 --> 25:31.375
Thought you were nuts
when you wanted to bring our gear.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.291
Yeah, well, better safe than sorry.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.791
Sky! Sky, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

25:35.875 --> 25:37.291
We are going after Beatrix.

25:37.375 --> 25:38.375
Stella told you?

25:38.458 --> 25:41.416
She told me what was going on.
It'd be nice if my girlfriend did.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.166
Did she tell you it's a trap?

25:43.250 --> 25:46.291
The Blood Witches are trying
to lure fairies to steal their magic.

25:46.375 --> 25:49.458
We've been training for this.
Specialists can take out scrapers,

25:49.541 --> 25:52.166
while mind fairies protect us
from Blood Witch magic.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.041
Mind fairies good for something?
Present. I'm in.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.000
-Wait, so we are going?
-No.

25:57.708 --> 26:00.958
We are not going. Guys, we can't go
anywhere near that lodge.

26:01.041 --> 26:03.833
It is not safe for fairies. Any fairies.

26:03.916 --> 26:07.291
-We're gonna go back to Alfea and--
-Bloom. I'm going.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.916
For once my magic's useful. I need this.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.583
We got this. Call Silva.
Get everyone back to Alfea.

26:13.666 --> 26:15.541
I'll text you when we have Beatrix.

26:17.250 --> 26:18.666
Wait. Has anyone seen Aisha?

26:26.541 --> 26:29.500
I can't remember the last time
I just did nothing.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.875
-The curse of the overachiever.

26:34.833 --> 26:36.541
What's that about by the way?

26:36.625 --> 26:38.666
Oh, easy. Family.

26:39.708 --> 26:42.125
My parents run a bunch
of hydro-energy facilities

26:42.208 --> 26:43.416
on the border of Andros.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.208
Their plan was for me
was to go to school near home,

26:46.291 --> 26:48.416
graduate, and take over.

26:49.416 --> 26:53.125
The idea that I wanted to come
all the way to Alfea and go into academia?

26:53.208 --> 26:54.708
Not ideal.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.500
You have to achieve
to prove you made the right choice?

26:59.583 --> 27:02.958
It's weird how we can resent our families,
but still want their approval.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.000
That's beautiful.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.625
It's basically tiny bugs,
but yeah.

27:18.666 --> 27:19.875
Wait. What is that?

27:21.958 --> 27:23.125
I don't see anything.

27:25.416 --> 27:27.583
Wow!

27:29.416 --> 27:32.875
Oh, hang on. You basically have
a tiny bug on your face.

27:33.958 --> 27:35.000
Um…

28:24.916 --> 28:28.500
For once, couldn't we break into
a playground or something cute?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.291
A playground would be less creepy?

28:31.083 --> 28:32.875
Are you sure you wanna do this?

28:33.625 --> 28:34.500
Mm-hmm.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.666
Because that's not annoying.

28:49.750 --> 28:53.375
Sorry I'm not all calm while my friends
and boyfriend waltz into a trap.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.333
This is what they've trained for.

28:56.416 --> 28:59.625
You don't have to save the day.
I know that's a tough pill to swallow.

28:59.708 --> 29:03.291
You're right. I could sit and dictate
like a princess. Not risk myself at all.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.875
-Is that really what you think?
-If the crown fits…

29:07.125 --> 29:09.375
You really think
I wanna sit here and do nothing?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.083
I can't go.

29:13.458 --> 29:16.083
Physically, I cannot leave
the border of Alfea.

29:17.041 --> 29:20.208
Because Rosalind,
at the request of my mum,

29:21.625 --> 29:25.208
implanted this thing in me to control me.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.916
I mean,
I'm basically wearing a magical leash.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.125
So if you really wanna know
what being a princess means,

29:33.208 --> 29:34.375
this is it.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.166
Why didn't you tell us?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.375
Because of the looks
you're giving me right now.

29:54.791 --> 29:56.583
Upstairs. I can feel her.

30:09.833 --> 30:10.833
Beatrix!

30:13.541 --> 30:14.833
She… she's still alive.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.083
-Let's get her and go.
-Okay.

30:18.166 --> 30:20.125
If she's unconscious,
how did she text Stella?

30:25.083 --> 30:27.625
-Scrapers.
-How many are there?

30:28.625 --> 30:30.375
-Here we go.

30:36.708 --> 30:38.291
Andreas? What the fuck?

30:38.375 --> 30:40.208
-There's something wrong.

30:40.291 --> 30:41.958
He's not Andreas.

30:44.708 --> 30:45.708
Run.

31:31.625 --> 31:32.666
Are you okay?

31:33.500 --> 31:36.250
We found Beatrix.
But you were right. It was a trap.

31:36.333 --> 31:39.458
-What? Are you hurt?
-<i>There were scrapers. I got bitten.</i>

31:39.541 --> 31:40.875
Only for a second, but…

31:42.791 --> 31:44.416
there's something wrong with my magic.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.208
Your magic is going to falter.

31:46.291 --> 31:48.541
If it only bit you for a second,
it'll be temporary.

31:48.625 --> 31:52.041
Scrapers need to completely drain you
for the effect to be permanent.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.000
-It'll go back to normal?
-<i>Yes.</i>

31:54.083 --> 31:55.916
-How'd you know?
-Been studying them.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.375
-What about Sky and Riven?
-I don't know.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.041
Andreas came out of nowhere
and started fighting them.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.791
But I don't think it's just him.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.875
<i>I could feel somebody else in his mind.</i>

32:06.375 --> 32:08.791
A Blood Witch. We need to break
the connection, Musa.

32:08.875 --> 32:13.166
-What else could you feel?
-Anger. Years and years of anger.

32:13.250 --> 32:16.500
A grudge, like whoever's
controlling Andreas knows him.

32:16.583 --> 32:20.833
O-okay. J-just stay where you are.
Don't move. Silva's on his way.

32:20.916 --> 32:21.958
Okay.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.958
-Andreas, no.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.291
Get Beatrix out of here.

32:52.166 --> 32:53.583
Get her back to Alfea.

32:54.958 --> 32:57.833
-Hey. Have you seen Musa?
-No.

32:58.583 --> 32:59.666
Oh fuck.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.000
Who's controlling Andreas?

33:31.083 --> 33:34.958
All of this assumes that the Blood Witch,
they have to be an outsider,

33:35.041 --> 33:36.625
but if they know Andreas then--

33:36.708 --> 33:38.458
They're definitely an insider.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.583
What, so, like, a student or faculty?

33:40.666 --> 33:44.583
Or alum or…
someone from the banquet. I don't…

33:49.541 --> 33:50.541
Oh my God!

33:52.416 --> 33:53.958
Oh my God. I have to go.

33:54.541 --> 33:57.333
-<i> It's a trap.</i>
-<i> I'm going for the one who set it.</i>

33:58.041 --> 34:00.958
<i>One person hates Andreas and Rosalind</i>
<i>more than anyone.</i>

34:01.041 --> 34:03.166
<i>He's been by our side this whole time.</i>

34:03.250 --> 34:06.125
<i>Text Aisha and tell her where I'm going.</i>
<i>I have to stop him.</i>

34:23.666 --> 34:25.000
No, please! Please! Please!

34:26.375 --> 34:28.500
Please! Andreas, don't!

34:31.458 --> 34:33.291
-Sebastian.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.708
-Oh.

34:37.791 --> 34:38.833
Hi there.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.041
I can't believe I trusted you.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.958
Oh, don't feel too bad.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.625
I'm, uh… I'm very trustworthy.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.791
Ask all my friends.

34:52.375 --> 34:55.541
Silva excluded. He won't be happy.

34:59.625 --> 35:01.291
Ballsy of you to come alone.

35:03.125 --> 35:07.000
I assumed all the scrapers would be
at the lodge for your little trap.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.625
Good assumption.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.833
They're on their way back now.
Won't take long.

35:10.916 --> 35:14.208
No, you'll already
be back at Alfea with me.

35:14.291 --> 35:17.333
-Because right now you're powerless.
-Oh.

35:17.416 --> 35:20.708
-Blood Witch magic won't work on fairies.
-Also true.

35:21.666 --> 35:23.125
However…

35:23.958 --> 35:26.750
…I have been working
on that little problem.

35:33.416 --> 35:36.083
What do you think I've been doing
with fairy magic?

35:36.708 --> 35:39.083
Sticking it in a jar for a rainy day?

35:40.333 --> 35:41.916
I got a few duds at first.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.500
-Weak light fairy.

35:44.583 --> 35:47.041
-Sad little water fairy.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.791
Devin was, uh…

35:48.875 --> 35:50.541
…not the best mind fairy.

35:51.791 --> 35:53.916
But then I got a few contenders.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.416
Whoever your contenders are,

36:03.500 --> 36:04.500
they're not me.

36:07.708 --> 36:11.500
No need to show off.
I know you're powerful, Bloom.

36:11.583 --> 36:13.375
I know everything about you.

36:13.458 --> 36:16.916
Where you grew up.
What sports you played as a little kid.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.833
What your parents do for a living.
Uh, adoptive parents, obviously.

36:21.583 --> 36:23.208
I also know about the other ones.

36:29.375 --> 36:32.291
You know who… who my birth parents are?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.041
Just think.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.416
If, uh…

36:39.250 --> 36:43.166
if you stayed with me,
you could have all the answers by now.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.208
Maybe it's not too late.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.500
Don't you want all the answers?

36:54.125 --> 36:56.333
You could have them if you joined me.

37:05.916 --> 37:07.208
I guess not.

37:11.333 --> 37:12.166
Bloom!

37:12.250 --> 37:14.291
Hey. Oh, great timing.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.291
-What happened?
-I'll tell you later.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.791
I know what I'm talking about.
I did the research.

37:37.875 --> 37:41.583
I'm sure you did, but Musa is my friend,
so I'd prefer to check it myself.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.875
Why do you always have to second-guess me?

37:43.958 --> 37:46.083
Most of the time you need second-guessing.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.875
-Like with Riven.
-This isn't about Riven.

37:49.458 --> 37:53.125
But, yeah, Riven is a perfect example
of you not thinking things through,

37:53.208 --> 37:55.541
then making a terrible decision
I have to clean up.

37:55.625 --> 37:58.166
It'd be easier to talk about
what's happening here

37:58.250 --> 38:00.708
if we could actually talk
about what's happening.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.416
And what's that?

38:04.041 --> 38:05.041
You're jealous.

38:07.166 --> 38:08.208
What?

38:08.291 --> 38:12.625
Oh, come on, Terra. Admit it.
It kills you when I succeed without you.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.875
Is that really what you think?

38:17.833 --> 38:20.416
If I'm so horrible,
why are we even friends?

38:21.083 --> 38:23.416
Sometimes I ask myself the same question.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.583
What's the word on Marco?

38:29.666 --> 38:32.291
We found him. Outside the lodge.
Completely drained.

38:36.083 --> 38:39.291
Everyone, back to your rooms now!

38:42.041 --> 38:44.375
Ladies, did you have a nice night?

38:45.875 --> 38:48.000
Saul told me you've broken the connection.

38:48.083 --> 38:50.625
-Does that mean you found the Blood Witch?
-Sebastian.

38:50.708 --> 38:51.916
Little shit.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.625
-Where is he now?
-In the First World.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.541
There's a portal in his shop.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.291
What did he tell you? Did he say anything?

39:01.916 --> 39:03.875
He said that he knew my birth parents.

39:04.958 --> 39:06.958
And that he'd tell me if I betrayed you.

39:08.291 --> 39:10.125
Told you Blood Witches fight dirty.

39:10.208 --> 39:11.375
We can use that.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.416
I shouldn't have gone to that pub.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.875
No, you shouldn't.

39:15.916 --> 39:19.166
But in the grand scheme of things,
it's a minor fuckup.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.125
Take the win.

39:22.833 --> 39:23.750
Thank you.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.375
-Hey.
-What?!

39:38.458 --> 39:40.916
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay. It's okay.

39:43.458 --> 39:46.291
Beatrix, you were kidnapped
by a Blood Witch,

39:46.375 --> 39:49.416
but it happened a few days ago,
and you're safe now, okay?

39:51.958 --> 39:54.375
Uh, the last thing I remember
was one of those

39:55.083 --> 39:56.916
scraper things coming after me.

39:59.875 --> 40:00.916
No…

40:03.250 --> 40:05.166
Oh God, I'm so sorry, Beatrix.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.083
Fuck.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.625
-I'm so sorry. What I said was awful.
-No. No.

40:31.708 --> 40:36.208
You were right.
Of course you're right. I'm jealous.

40:49.833 --> 40:51.208
Riven and I kissed.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.458
Like, a few years ago.

40:53.541 --> 40:55.375
We fermented our own beer one night.

40:55.458 --> 40:58.291
-That's really nerdy, I know.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.000
But we got drunk, and I kissed him.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.458
Why didn't you tell me?

41:03.541 --> 41:06.625
Because it only lasted for a few seconds
before I pulled away.

41:06.708 --> 41:09.083
It was… awkward.

41:11.041 --> 41:15.625
And then to move it
from awkward to mortifying, I…

41:16.833 --> 41:18.875
vomited in my hand in front of him.

41:18.958 --> 41:22.000
-Oh my God.
-I know.

41:22.083 --> 41:27.583
Then I don't know if he was embarrassed
that I… was sick after we kissed

41:27.666 --> 41:30.208
or if he was embarrassed because

41:31.708 --> 41:33.500
we kissed at all,

41:33.583 --> 41:35.833
but afterwards he started ignoring me,

41:36.333 --> 41:39.333
which felt like shit, so I did the same.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.583
It was a cold war.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.541
I didn't know you two had history.

41:44.625 --> 41:47.791
Please, it's ancient history,
and that's not what I'm jealous of.

41:48.583 --> 41:51.458
You and Riven
are a terrible idea,

41:51.541 --> 41:53.291
but I will support you

41:53.375 --> 41:55.833
because I know you'll do it anyway.

41:56.791 --> 41:58.375
Thank you.

41:59.791 --> 42:01.125
You're fearless, Flora.

42:02.625 --> 42:05.041
In who you are and what you want.

42:07.250 --> 42:08.166
And that's--

42:08.750 --> 42:12.166
The real thing I'm jealous of
is how easily you

42:13.500 --> 42:14.416
are you.

42:18.833 --> 42:20.166
What is this about, Terra?

42:22.916 --> 42:26.250
Before Riven and I kissed,
I knew it wasn't what I wanted,

42:26.333 --> 42:27.666
but I had to try it.

42:27.750 --> 42:30.125
And then when he ignored me,

42:30.875 --> 42:32.708
it gave me an out.

42:33.583 --> 42:35.500
He was the problem.

42:35.583 --> 42:37.000
And then I met Dane, who…

42:37.583 --> 42:39.708
Total opposite. Maybe he's the right guy.

42:39.791 --> 42:43.666
But, of course,
Dane didn't even like me, so…

42:45.916 --> 42:47.041
he was the problem.

42:48.083 --> 42:51.791
But I think I knew at the back of my mind
that they weren't the problem. I was.

42:51.875 --> 42:55.125
Hey, nothing about you is a problem.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.625
But one thing is.

43:01.291 --> 43:02.458
I think

43:04.000 --> 43:06.083
I…

43:06.875 --> 43:09.833
…pick shitty, unattainable guys because

43:11.750 --> 43:14.375
I'm… not into guys.

43:19.416 --> 43:22.958
You can say it out loud.

43:25.541 --> 43:26.833
Uh…

43:26.916 --> 43:30.583
I think I'm gay. Is that… weird?

43:30.666 --> 43:35.000
God, no. It's perfect.
Terra, you're perfect, okay? Come here.

43:35.083 --> 43:37.083
Oh!

43:43.666 --> 43:45.541
-Hey, are you good?
-Yeah.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.875
I'm really glad that you're back.

43:52.875 --> 43:57.166
I'm so sorry. I should have come to you.
I had to fight the Blood Witch and I--

43:57.250 --> 43:58.500
Saved my life.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.583
I thought I had it, Bloom.

44:03.666 --> 44:05.958
<i>You broke the connection,</i>
<i>but it only lasted a second.</i>

44:07.708 --> 44:10.458
Do what you have to do. Please.

44:10.541 --> 44:13.041
It's okay. It's okay.

44:13.875 --> 44:15.000
<i> It was too strong.</i>

44:16.291 --> 44:17.875
Sebastian was too strong.

44:17.958 --> 44:19.208
How's Andreas?

44:24.416 --> 44:27.500
Silva's bringing his body back
to the school.

44:27.583 --> 44:28.750
Oh!

44:35.166 --> 44:37.833
He was gonna kill Silva.
I didn't have a choice.

44:38.875 --> 44:40.083
I'm sorry.

44:43.291 --> 44:44.708
I didn't have a choice.

44:57.708 --> 45:01.458
-I should have got there sooner.
-You got there when you were supposed to.

45:01.541 --> 45:03.583
You and Bloom saved their lives.

45:05.208 --> 45:07.958
I mean, none of them might have come back
if you hadn't…

45:09.708 --> 45:10.708
Where's Musa?

45:10.791 --> 45:11.958
I need some help.

45:15.958 --> 45:17.333
Somebody help me.

45:18.541 --> 45:19.833
I need some help.
