00:01.252 --> 00:03.192
You’ll never get over
it, but you'll get used to it.

00:03.193 --> 00:04.121
You got married?

00:04.122 --> 00:05.440
I'm just too afraid to tell
my mom now.

00:05.441 --> 00:06.651
You're the one who walked away,
Neil.

00:06.652 --> 00:07.886
You had the affair, remember?

00:07.887 --> 00:08.964
Nothing happened with Gloria.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.169
- When I get back, I want you out of this house.
- It's my house.

00:11.170 --> 00:12.703
- Where's my dad?
- Gone.

00:12.704 --> 00:14.610
All I would do was hang
out with my best friend

00:14.615 --> 00:16.890
and go tanning with
her and go shopping...

00:16.893 --> 00:18.826
Let's be honest for a sec.
That's what this is all about.

00:18.829 --> 00:20.070
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

00:20.076 --> 00:24.196
It's just... I miss my friend.

00:27.209 --> 00:29.082
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

00:29.256 --> 00:30.550
I'm glad you came.

00:30.745 --> 00:31.950
What brings you in?

00:34.707 --> 00:38.010
Well, I've changed a lot

00:38.016 --> 00:39.492
since I got to college.

00:39.495 --> 00:42.483
New friends, new interests,

00:42.498 --> 00:44.160
new clothes.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.733
Well, that's
perfectly normal.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.302
I know.

00:48.457 --> 00:52.053
But... I think throwing myself
into all these new things

00:52.057 --> 00:54.082
is just a way of avoiding
dealing with

00:54.087 --> 00:55.800
what happened to my friend...

00:57.056 --> 01:01.000
who, um... who died.

01:02.888 --> 01:06.100
Well, grief often comes
in five stages.

01:07.278 --> 01:09.823
Yeah, but I haven't
really been grieving.

01:16.447 --> 01:17.791
Why is this happening?

01:17.798 --> 01:19.943
Life is so unfair!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.452
I'd do anything
to change things.

01:27.457 --> 01:29.313
Please, just name it,
and I'll do it.

01:36.808 --> 01:39.133
Nothing matters anyway.

01:55.478 --> 01:57.363
But this is so not fair!

02:04.366 --> 02:06.362
I'm sorry, I have rage issues.

02:08.548 --> 02:10.521
I think she would want me
to move on.

02:11.015 --> 02:12.822
So that's what I'm going
to try to do.

02:17.145 --> 02:18.453
I'm proud of you, Summer.

02:18.455 --> 02:22.033
You've made astounding progress,
and all in one week.

02:22.387 --> 02:23.821
It's kind of a relief in a way.

02:23.827 --> 02:25.590
Now I can go back to being me.

02:26.198 --> 02:27.623
What do you mean by that?

02:28.378 --> 02:29.723
Well, this whole save the planet

02:29.725 --> 02:31.070
thing, it was a crutch, right?

02:31.605 --> 02:34.321
And nothing against handicapped
people, but crutches? Ew.

02:34.776 --> 02:37.333
A lot of people do change
when they go to college.

02:37.687 --> 02:38.800
Well, not me.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.070
I love shopping, tanning
and celebrity gossip,

02:41.077 --> 02:42.272
always have, always will.

02:44.167 --> 02:46.641
But I think I have to.

02:47.547 --> 02:50.060
If I ever want things to be good
with my boyfriend again.

02:52.235 --> 02:55.591
- Summer, just promise you'll take it slow.
- Totally.

03:01.225 --> 03:03.072
- Allo
- Hey,

03:03.076 --> 03:04.760
dude, I know, three hour time difference,

03:04.768 --> 03:06.631
but, Ryan, she's going
to dump me.

03:06.638 --> 03:08.642
- It's okay, I'm awake.
- Oh, good.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.821
Ryan, she's going to dump me.

03:09.836 --> 03:12.390
No one believes that, all right?
Summer loves you.

03:12.396 --> 03:14.870
The old Summer loved me.
But new Summer is upon us,

03:14.877 --> 03:17.223
and Providence is the place
that spawned her.

03:17.227 --> 03:20.973
Summer is just dealing with what we're all dealing with, okay?
She'll come around.

03:20.977 --> 03:22.852
What if she doesn't?
This is my last shot.

03:22.856 --> 03:23.990
Otherwise, the girl with the

03:23.995 --> 03:26.892
violent temper and good hygiene
is nothing but a childhood memory.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.891
Careful, lady, my girlfriend's

03:44.898 --> 03:46.151
going to be here any second.

03:46.157 --> 03:47.563
Shut up, Cohen.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.530
Hey, you just punched me.

03:51.096 --> 03:53.223
My baby's back.

05:06.466 --> 05:08.932
-  You look good out there.
- Thanks.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.330
I got to get you on a surfboard.

05:10.338 --> 05:11.430
Not a chance.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.680
How about some breakfast?

05:13.225 --> 05:15.213
I could use some intel
on Seth and Summer.

05:15.217 --> 05:17.913
You know what, I can't,
but, uh, I think they're doing all right.

05:17.916 --> 05:19.420
You know? Doing the long distance thing.

05:19.428 --> 05:20.552
How about you?

05:20.696 --> 05:21.921
How are you doing?

05:21.926 --> 05:23.720
Good, good.
Better, once I get

05:23.728 --> 05:25.182
my first day of work under my belt.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.810
Well, Pavo Guapo is lucky
to have you working there.

05:27.815 --> 05:28.882
Me, too.

05:28.886 --> 05:30.952
Now I got an excuse to come
by for your shrimp tacos.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.752
Yeah, Kirsten warned me about that.
You're limited to two a week.

05:33.757 --> 05:36.262
Oh! I knew I should have divorced that dame.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.211
Well, it's not forever.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.991
You're still accepted to Berkeley for next year.

05:42.377 --> 05:44.341
I'm just glad you're getting back to your old self.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.213
You know?

05:46.217 --> 05:48.802
Back home again. New job.

05:49.107 --> 05:51.481
I'm just trying to stay busy
and earn some extra money.

05:52.287 --> 05:54.351
And hook me up with some shrimp tacos.

05:54.357 --> 05:56.002
Yeah, right. I'll work on that.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.212
I'm going to walk back.
I'm kind of sweaty.

05:58.216 --> 05:59.841
Yeah, I wasn't offering you a ride.

06:01.368 --> 06:02.410
Hey, Ryan?

06:03.568 --> 06:04.682
Hang in there.

06:11.065 --> 06:12.761
Wow, that was a lot better

06:12.767 --> 06:14.370
than what I was imagining on the plane.

06:15.605 --> 06:17.641
You were imagining it on the plane.

06:17.915 --> 06:19.171
Not like that.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.360
When you called me here,

06:20.368 --> 06:21.763
I was sure you were going to break up with me.

06:22.797 --> 06:24.280
Well, I know I'm not the one

06:24.285 --> 06:25.302
that usually apologizes

06:25.308 --> 06:26.560
in  this relationship,

06:26.565 --> 06:27.761
but I'm sorry

06:27.906 --> 06:29.132
about everything.

06:29.207 --> 06:30.613
I turned into a liberal zealot

06:30.615 --> 06:32.103
just to distract myself

06:32.107 --> 06:33.160
from my own grief.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.593
I'm not even into all this stuff.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.650
So the old you is back?

06:35.655 --> 06:37.281
In all of my artificially

06:37.285 --> 06:38.341
tanned glory.

06:38.347 --> 06:40.721
Thank God.
'Cause I was not sure

06:40.725 --> 06:42.981
that the new you and old me
were really working.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.783
Yeah, the new me kind of smelled weird.

06:47.337 --> 06:49.700
Well, what would you have done
if I didn't go back to being me?

06:50.168 --> 06:52.693
I had a plan to coax
the old Summer out.

06:53.896 --> 06:55.710
The Valley, Season Three?

06:56.977 --> 06:58.483
Awesome!

07:00.645 --> 07:01.873
I checked on Ryan.

07:01.878 --> 07:03.600
- Did he leave already?
- Yeah.

07:03.606 --> 07:05.143
He seemed to be doing okay.

07:05.157 --> 07:07.201
I was hoping to hang with him while Seth is away.

07:07.566 --> 07:09.213
Poker, maybe shoot, a little pool,

07:09.216 --> 07:10.882
but his new job is going to make that tough.

07:10.955 --> 07:12.443
Well, I could rack a few balls with you.

07:12.447 --> 07:14.312
You are so smart and sexy

07:14.316 --> 07:15.392
and gorgeous.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.361
But  sometimes a man just needs

07:17.365 --> 07:18.611
to hang with the guys.

07:18.617 --> 07:19.711
Well, that I'm not.

07:28.108 --> 07:31.242
You know, Jimmy left, Caleb died

07:31.698 --> 07:33.930
then Jimmy left again Even Neil's gone.

07:33.935 --> 07:34.940
Look, I wasn't a pennant winner,

07:34.946 --> 07:36.422
but at least I had a bullpen, you know?

07:36.647 --> 07:38.320
- It's baseball talk.
- I got it.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.156
Why don't you give Jason Spitz a call?

07:40.159 --> 07:41.940
You're always saying how funny he is.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.536
Why don't you ask him to do something?

07:43.549 --> 07:45.610
Yeah, yeah...
I don't know.

07:45.615 --> 07:47.443
I mean, it's a little weird
for a guy to ask another guy

07:47.447 --> 07:49.113
to do something right out of the blue like that.

07:49.118 --> 07:50.650
Since when is Sandy Cohen

07:50.656 --> 07:52.060
afraid of acting weird?

07:52.355 --> 07:53.821
Well, Spitz is pretty funny.

07:54.496 --> 07:55.930
He's allegedly a scratch golfer.

07:55.937 --> 07:57.231
He likes the Dodgers.

07:57.487 --> 07:58.572
I could live with that.

07:58.575 --> 07:59.723
It sounds perfect for you.

07:59.925 --> 08:00.982
Yeah, but what am I going to do?

08:00.988 --> 08:02.180
I'm going to give him a call or what?

08:02.305 --> 08:03.681
Ask him out?

08:05.116 --> 08:06.183
Come on.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.812
Why don't you use some of that Sandy Cohen charm?

08:08.818 --> 08:10.800
I'm sure he won't be able to resist.

08:10.816 --> 08:12.952
It's been a long time since
I have been out there, honey.

08:13.468 --> 08:15.080
What if Spitzy doesn't like me?

08:15.185 --> 08:17.702
- Are you calling him Spitzy now?
- No, not yet.

08:18.545 --> 08:19.591
Do you think he'll go for it?

08:20.595 --> 08:22.171
Well, that's very generous of you.

08:22.187 --> 08:23.811
Thank you, Neil.

08:24.476 --> 08:25.593
Bye.

08:26.775 --> 08:28.112
So how's Seattle?

08:28.905 --> 08:32.440
Is that short, sassy lady still bossing
Dr. Roberts around the hospital?

08:32.446 --> 08:33.780
Neil is fine.

08:35.256 --> 08:37.750
He's going to let us stay in the house as long as we want.

08:37.986 --> 08:39.111
Well, nice work, Mom.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.380
I wish I could take all the credit

08:40.385 --> 08:41.880
but it was actually Neil's idea.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.090
He's really very sweet.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.603
Oh, you miss him.

08:44.727 --> 08:45.882
Well, don't worry.

08:45.888 --> 08:47.112
We'll find you another old dude

08:47.115 --> 08:48.820
to pay for all your stuff and cheat on you.

08:48.828 --> 08:49.910
Is that what I'm teaching you?

08:50.038 --> 08:52.003
- Mm, pretty much.
- Well, no more.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.460
Now that we have our housing situation handled,

08:54.808 --> 08:57.462
- I am officially giving up men.
- Good one.

08:57.476 --> 08:59.101
That'll last a week, max.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.610
I'll take that wager, young lady.

09:00.616 --> 09:01.963
And I'll make one with you.

09:02.827 --> 09:04.023
I will not so much as bat

09:04.025 --> 09:05.182
an eyelash at a man,

09:05.185 --> 09:06.711
and you will stay out of trouble.

09:06.715 --> 09:08.031
You cannot live without a man.

09:08.368 --> 09:09.631
not even for a week.

09:12.498 --> 09:13.502
Morning, roomies.

09:13.838 --> 09:15.301
Anyone want a protein scramble?

09:15.306 --> 09:17.790
Nice to see you're making yourself at home, Taylor.

09:17.796 --> 09:19.800
Well, thanks for making me feel at home, Jules.

09:19.808 --> 09:21.620
Summer's room is just adorable.

09:21.627 --> 09:22.773
And I don't know how I ever

09:22.776 --> 09:23.882
lived without a home gym.

09:23.885 --> 09:25.531
Oh, this came for you today.

09:25.846 --> 09:27.480
Who's Henry Michael?

09:27.988 --> 09:29.011
Uh...

09:29.215 --> 09:30.270
Oh, Henri Michel?

09:30.276 --> 09:31.703
That's just, um,

09:31.705 --> 09:32.922
my French husband.

09:32.926 --> 09:34.351
I'm sure it's nothing. Excuse me.

09:37.835 --> 09:40.251
You see? Man drama--

09:40.255 --> 09:41.340
who needs it?

09:42.838 --> 09:44.933
Hey, Ernesto's

09:44.937 --> 09:46.052
looking pretty hot.

09:46.055 --> 09:47.390
Nice six-pack.

09:48.266 --> 09:49.330
Where?

09:49.575 --> 09:50.912
Gotcha.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.861
Taylor, hey.

10:12.018 --> 10:13.510
Hi, Ryan.

10:13.685 --> 10:15.220
Are you working at El Pavo Guapo?

10:15.226 --> 10:16.621
You know, that means a handsome turkey?

10:16.625 --> 10:18.163
That's why I took the job.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.531
Hey, do you know when

10:20.538 --> 10:21.621
Seth's going to be back?

10:21.625 --> 10:22.861
I really need to talk to him.

10:22.865 --> 10:24.272
Sorry, gone for the weekend.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.521
You know, that shirt really
brings out your eyes.

10:38.956 --> 10:40.871
It's black.
What are you doing here, Taylor?

10:40.875 --> 10:42.783
Just in the mood for Mexican.

10:43.366 --> 10:45.380
Maybe the Macho Nacho Burrito

10:45.387 --> 10:46.600
wrap with extra guac.

10:46.638 --> 10:47.981
And...

10:47.987 --> 10:49.972
Oh, um, a favor.

10:51.268 --> 10:52.861
No, no, no, sorry.

10:52.876 --> 10:54.933
With Seth gone, you're the only one I can turn to.

10:55.768 --> 10:56.783
Well, I'm honored.

10:56.788 --> 10:58.513
Okay,  so, I'm trying to get divorced,

10:58.516 --> 10:59.802
and I just found out that Henri Michel...

11:00.246 --> 11:02.032
Oh, that's my French husband.

11:02.035 --> 11:03.610
Um, he's coming to Newport

11:03.627 --> 11:05.121
and I know he's going to try and talk me out of it,

11:05.127 --> 11:07.720
and I could really use you there.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.332
No.

11:10.027 --> 11:11.411
I'm afraid to be alone with him.

11:12.368 --> 11:13.462
I'm afraid

11:13.465 --> 11:15.862
of his sensual powers.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.121
Ryan, the man is

11:17.125 --> 11:18.563
a sexual Jedi.

11:18.567 --> 11:19.921
Whatever he asks you to do,

11:19.936 --> 11:21.112
you just do it.

11:21.116 --> 11:22.771
It doesn't matter how depraved...

11:22.778 --> 11:23.962
Okay, some people are trying to eat here,

11:23.966 --> 11:25.242
including me someday, so...

11:25.245 --> 11:26.761
Ryan, please.

11:26.765 --> 11:28.241
If I go alone, I'll be back

11:28.248 --> 11:29.550
in France next week.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.113
You don't know how hard it was to leave.

11:31.118 --> 11:32.213
Seth and Summer are gone,

11:32.216 --> 11:33.563
my mom kicked me out, and...

11:35.156 --> 11:36.690
I have no one else.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.491
Look, just do me this one favor,

11:38.495 --> 11:39.843
and I'll leave you alone.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.910
Promise?

11:44.667 --> 11:45.683
Knock, knock.

11:45.685 --> 11:48.611
Hey, Summer, can you fact-check this flier
on solar panels?

11:48.616 --> 11:50.360
It's for the rally tomorrow.

11:52.327 --> 11:53.832
Che, I'd like to talk.

11:54.165 --> 11:55.283
Sure, man. What's up?

11:56.166 --> 11:57.692
I haven't been completely honest

11:57.695 --> 11:59.050
with you about who I really am.

12:04.096 --> 12:06.491
This is my shoe collection.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.311
There's leather, suede,

12:08.315 --> 12:10.411
and the occasional calfskin boot.

12:13.007 --> 12:15.171
Whoa, my friend.

12:15.747 --> 12:18.821
These are my magazines.

12:18.826 --> 12:21.291
I know which stars
pump gas just like us,

12:21.296 --> 12:23.310
and who's on pump watch.

12:28.385 --> 12:29.741
And this is Marissa.

12:30.535 --> 12:32.383
She was my best friend,

12:32.387 --> 12:34.552
um, but she died

12:34.555 --> 12:36.453
in a car accident on graduation night.

12:38.965 --> 12:40.153
Summer, I'm sorry.

12:40.156 --> 12:41.300
That's-That's really heavy.

12:41.306 --> 12:43.583
Yeah, well, it's so heavy

12:43.586 --> 12:44.610
that I couldn't deal,

12:45.566 --> 12:49.530
so..., I put all my energy

12:49.546 --> 12:50.692
towards being an activist,

12:50.708 --> 12:52.493
but that's not who I am.

12:52.496 --> 12:55.312
These shoes and these magazines-- that's me,

12:55.645 --> 12:56.692
but I hope

12:56.696 --> 12:57.823
we can still be friends.

12:58.198 --> 13:00.872
All I can do is be me,

13:00.875 --> 13:02.532
whoever  that is.

13:03.105 --> 13:04.811
It's, uh... it's Dylan.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.080
The guy's a genius.

13:06.506 --> 13:08.301
Look, Summer,
if you've found

13:08.407 --> 13:10.551
your place in this world, I am

13:10.555 --> 13:12.330
nothing but happy for you.

13:13.305 --> 13:14.301
Hey.

13:14.308 --> 13:15.650
I put some cream in your coffee.

13:15.658 --> 13:17.041
I figured you'd be back on dairy.

13:17.058 --> 13:19.021
Hey, uh, Che, this is
my boyfriend, Seth.

13:19.026 --> 13:20.111
Seth, this is Che.

13:20.116 --> 13:22.900
Summer, you have a twin flame.

13:23.366 --> 13:24.911
I wish I knew you were coming into town.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.223
I would have made you a bracelet.

13:26.226 --> 13:27.451
Oh, hey.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.720
Uh, where I come from,

13:29.726 --> 13:30.730
we just say hey.

13:30.736 --> 13:32.021
Well, to borrow

13:32.026 --> 13:33.793
your native tongue, hey.

13:33.797 --> 13:35.371
Listen, forget what I said about the rally.

13:35.375 --> 13:36.762
We got plenty of warriors for the fight.

13:36.766 --> 13:40.501
You two, just... be.

13:41.285 --> 13:42.591
Thanks, Che.

13:44.016 --> 13:46.151
- What's that?
- It's garbage.

13:50.445 --> 13:51.672
Hi, Jason. How you doing?

13:51.677 --> 13:53.531
I just had a meeting with Kaminsky.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.231
Oh, the slowest talker in the world.

13:55.246 --> 13:57.560
- It took forever.
- Forever.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.101
Good to see you, man.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.170
Hey, uh...

14:02.028 --> 14:03.463
you got any plans this weekend?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.161
Sandy, I've been working the past six Saturdays.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.392
No, no, I didn't mean that.

14:06.408 --> 14:08.042
I'm just saying that we could,

14:08.147 --> 14:11.671
you know, you and I, uh,
we could do something.

14:14.338 --> 14:15.540
Do something?

14:16.175 --> 14:17.233
Poker, pool,

14:17.237 --> 14:18.552
you know, a little small ball.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.601
If you're free.
If not, no worries.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.351
Can I get back to you on that?

14:26.356 --> 14:27.502
Oh, sure, yeah.

14:27.507 --> 14:28.793
Whatever.

14:33.287 --> 14:35.460
But I had to spend the night with Derek.

14:35.465 --> 14:36.792
He tore his ACL.

14:37.038 --> 14:39.393
Hey, it's not my fault he'll never kickbox again.

14:40.225 --> 14:42.332
God, this is so disgusting.

14:43.027 --> 14:44.362
I don't know, I think you're

14:44.367 --> 14:45.831
being too hard on April.

14:46.495 --> 14:48.241
Derek's knee was...

14:48.246 --> 14:49.231
it was really messed up.

14:49.246 --> 14:51.310
No, I just... I don't like this show anymore.

14:51.315 --> 14:52.551
All they do is create fake

14:52.555 --> 14:53.931
problems for fake people

14:53.935 --> 14:55.251
just to distract viewers from

14:55.255 --> 14:56.610
the real problems in the world.

14:57.237 --> 14:58.291
Well, I don't think the network

14:58.307 --> 14:59.821
would go for a sexy teen soap

14:59.828 --> 15:01.170
set in the Damascus, but we

15:01.177 --> 15:02.312
can turn it off if you want.

15:02.316 --> 15:03.722
I just thought you liked it.

15:03.977 --> 15:05.161
I'm just distracted.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.072
I haven't been keeping up

15:06.075 --> 15:06.993
on how much blow

15:06.996 --> 15:07.992
Lindsay Lohan's doing.

15:07.996 --> 15:10.741
- And did you hear about JT and Cameron?
- No, what?

15:10.747 --> 15:12.761
I don't know.
That is the point.

15:12.768 --> 15:14.483
I'm going to go get one of my magazines.

15:14.675 --> 15:16.552
That sounds like the old Summer.

15:17.767 --> 15:20.433
I'm going to stay here and, uh, keep watching.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.222
You know, I have this thing where if I start something,

15:22.225 --> 15:23.272
I have to finish.

15:23.276 --> 15:24.870
Is that like a disease or a condition?

15:24.878 --> 15:25.862
Don't really know, Cohen.

15:25.866 --> 15:28.192
I'm reading about who got lipo.

15:53.515 --> 15:55.343
You know, you might want to relax.

15:55.347 --> 15:56.321
Distract me.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.330
Tell  me about this,
um, cage fighting.

15:58.336 --> 16:00.191
It's something that I've been meaning to get into.

16:00.198 --> 16:01.130
Yeah? Yeah?

16:01.136 --> 16:02.753
Ask me another favor, I'll be happy to show you.

16:02.766 --> 16:04.741
Oh, Ryan Atwood with

16:04.805 --> 16:05.690
a side of sauce.

16:05.696 --> 16:06.591
I like it.

16:06.597 --> 16:07.772
You're going to have to do better, though,

16:07.777 --> 16:09.132
'cause right now all I can

16:09.137 --> 16:10.702
think of is him, my husband,

16:10.706 --> 16:13.702
and his arms, his smell...

16:13.935 --> 16:15.693
making love in the barn in Burgundy.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.251
Sounds like the perfect guy.

16:17.258 --> 16:18.272
Why would you want to divorce?

16:18.286 --> 16:20.490
Well, despite being

16:20.498 --> 16:22.031
agnostic in most things,

16:22.037 --> 16:23.721
I do believe in true love.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.150
And this was not it.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.973
Well, back to you and your life.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.590
What is your favorite fruit?

16:34.636 --> 16:35.890
Peaches.

16:37.127 --> 16:38.190
Oh, he used to say my breasts

16:38.196 --> 16:39.441
were like two, soft...

16:39.448 --> 16:40.553
Is that him?

16:41.548 --> 16:42.841
No, that's...

16:43.138 --> 16:44.583
his lawyer.

16:46.765 --> 16:47.751
Madam.

16:54.685 --> 16:55.830
Is everything okay?

16:55.846 --> 16:58.093
No, not exactly.

17:30.776 --> 17:31.783
What did he say?

17:31.798 --> 17:32.813
What's wrong?

17:59.357 --> 18:00.442
What's going on?

18:00.446 --> 18:02.902
Oh, I just told him you were a soccer fan.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.552
Oh.

18:05.056 --> 18:06.600
Yeah, I like soccer.

18:09.587 --> 18:11.302
Sorry today was such a bust.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.763
What are you talking about?

18:12.778 --> 18:14.523
We totally cleaned out the mall.

18:15.857 --> 18:18.381
Well, you threw your smoothie at a lady on the street.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.943
Hey, that fur did not look faux.

18:20.576 --> 18:23.483
Yeah, I just feel like your mind
is someplace else.

18:23.496 --> 18:25.473
My mind is on this adorable

18:25.476 --> 18:26.723
sweater right here.

18:26.918 --> 18:29.103
And I'm going to try it on with that bag we bought,

18:29.106 --> 18:30.583
because how cute would they look together?

18:30.585 --> 18:32.332
Now, if you don't mind, a little privacy.

18:33.527 --> 18:34.813
Well, I enjoy watching you

18:34.815 --> 18:35.713
take off your clothes,

18:35.725 --> 18:37.511
I'm sure I'll enjoy watching
you put them on.

18:37.518 --> 18:39.233
Hey, this is a very intense process.

18:40.977 --> 18:42.261
All right, actually this is perfect.

18:42.267 --> 18:43.852
I wanted to head over to Thayer Street

18:43.855 --> 18:45.693
and do a walking tour of ethnic foods.

18:45.696 --> 18:47.761
I can't be moving here if the shwarma is not up to par.

18:47.766 --> 18:49.220
Well, bring me a kabob.

18:59.907 --> 19:00.820
Hey, Summer.

19:00.828 --> 19:03.953
Che, hey, I wanted to know
how the rally went.

19:03.957 --> 19:06.420
We marched, we chanted,

19:06.425 --> 19:07.980
and along the way,

19:07.988 --> 19:09.820
we may have even opened up
a few eyes.

19:09.828 --> 19:12.383
- We'll see.
- Oh, that sounds great.

19:12.386 --> 19:13.753
Yeah, Summer, what are you doing?

19:13.758 --> 19:14.890
Trying on a sweater.

19:14.895 --> 19:17.651
Hey, Seth and I are going to watch a movie here later
if you want to come by.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.632
No, I can't. We're preparing for tomorrow
night's debate.

19:19.635 --> 19:21.792
- Debate?
- They agreed to grant us an audience

19:21.795 --> 19:23.642
with the dean, present our proposal.

19:23.798 --> 19:25.191
Only thing not powered by the

19:25.195 --> 19:27.193
fuel of the sun is our passion.

19:27.197 --> 19:29.193
Uh, well, tell everyone I said

19:29.198 --> 19:30.131
hi, and good luck.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.322
Yeah, thanks.
So do you like it?

19:32.325 --> 19:33.441
Huh? Like what?

19:34.338 --> 19:35.643
The new sweater.

19:38.508 --> 19:39.402
No.

19:39.597 --> 19:41.213
So you're really giving up on men?

19:41.217 --> 19:43.511
Men are to me, what Chardonnay is to you.

19:44.387 --> 19:45.831
One sip and I'm upside down

19:45.846 --> 19:46.832
on a chandelier.

19:47.256 --> 19:48.432
Not that you've ever done that.

19:48.737 --> 19:50.033
What's your point, Julie?

19:50.038 --> 19:51.102
I'm just trying to set

19:51.108 --> 19:52.400
a good example for Kaitlin,

19:52.408 --> 19:54.000
develop my own interests,

19:54.058 --> 19:55.690
maybe my career,

19:56.446 --> 19:59.163
that is, if you'd still have me as a partner.

20:01.008 --> 20:02.301
As I told you,

20:02.495 --> 20:03.830
New Match is there for you

20:03.838 --> 20:05.021
whenever you want.

20:05.097 --> 20:06.881
Thanks, Kiks. I was hoping

20:06.888 --> 20:07.923
you'd say that.

20:07.928 --> 20:09.343
Okay, so, I have so many

20:09.347 --> 20:10.821
new ideas about expanding.

20:10.827 --> 20:12.812
I went online.
I checked out some office...

20:13.566 --> 20:14.532
Oh, there's Taryn.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.063
Wow, she looks amazing.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.033
Did she have some work done?

20:19.187 --> 20:20.811
She's had something.

20:23.068 --> 20:25.382
Kirsten, great to see you.

20:25.388 --> 20:27.193
Julie, I'm so sorry

20:27.195 --> 20:28.111
about Neil.

20:28.216 --> 20:29.612
I hope you plan to sue.

20:29.627 --> 20:30.932
You know, just because you aren't legal

20:30.945 --> 20:32.683
doesn't mean you're not entitled to some sort of...

20:33.615 --> 20:34.603
Oh, it's Sandy.

20:34.606 --> 20:35.523
Excuse me.

20:36.087 --> 20:37.831
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, guess what?

20:37.836 --> 20:39.210
I'm not good at guessing.

20:39.216 --> 20:40.111
I'm going out.

20:40.468 --> 20:42.050
I'm jealous, with who?

20:42.056 --> 20:43.910
Spitz! Spitzy to me.

20:43.925 --> 20:45.410
- He called?
- He called.

20:45.425 --> 20:46.322
How about that?

20:46.328 --> 20:47.400
How about that?

20:47.775 --> 20:49.421
Maybe a little golf, maybe a

20:49.425 --> 20:51.460
drink after, watch the game.

20:51.468 --> 20:52.530
Golfing, game watching,

20:52.537 --> 20:53.961
suddenly not so jealous.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.440
Thanks, but I don't think

20:55.448 --> 20:57.492
I won’t be needing a dating service anymore.

20:57.496 --> 20:58.400
Really?

20:58.408 --> 20:59.740
I didn't know you were seeing anyone.

20:59.746 --> 21:01.150
Oh, not someone...

21:01.157 --> 21:02.613
someones.

21:02.866 --> 21:04.482
Young ones.

21:04.587 --> 21:07.230
Men our age are so complicated.

21:07.235 --> 21:08.952
Young guys just like
to have fun.

21:08.957 --> 21:09.962
And they are so

21:09.968 --> 21:11.153
grateful for a woman

21:11.155 --> 21:12.530
who knows what she's doing.

21:13.165 --> 21:16.191
Oh, so grateful, and limber.

21:17.395 --> 21:18.961
Hey, a group of us are

21:18.965 --> 21:20.022
going out tomorrow night.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.780
You should come.

21:22.557 --> 21:24.543
Uh, I'm trying to be a role model.

21:30.515 --> 21:31.641
I'll call you.

21:33.465 --> 21:34.651
Did Taryn run off already?

21:35.218 --> 21:37.160
- What's she doing?
- Him.

21:41.557 --> 21:42.561
Hey, Kaitlin!

21:42.568 --> 21:45.320
We got a guy who can
hook us up with fake I.D.'s.

21:45.327 --> 21:46.330
It's awesome.

21:46.658 --> 21:47.692
I think I'll pass.

21:49.148 --> 21:50.411
You've wanted a fake I.D.

21:50.415 --> 21:51.422
since you were six.

21:51.426 --> 21:53.780
- Yeah, come on.
- Yeah, and the guy's leaving town next week.

21:53.795 --> 21:55.431
- Well, where is he going?
- He's going to prison.

21:55.436 --> 21:57.580
- Yeah, for fraud.
- Because he's awesome.

21:57.585 --> 21:58.861
Look, you guys, I made

21:58.865 --> 22:01.181
a bet with my mom
that I'd stay out of trouble.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.671
And this definitely
sounds like trouble.

22:03.678 --> 22:04.993
Dude, not if we don't get caught.

22:05.007 --> 22:06.372
Dude, seriously.

22:06.388 --> 22:07.800
Yeah, dude, seriously.

22:10.505 --> 22:12.092
Well, with a foolproof plan

22:12.096 --> 22:14.183
like that, how can I say no?

22:19.466 --> 22:20.483
Garcon?

22:20.958 --> 22:22.312
Ah! Taylor.

22:22.568 --> 22:23.511
It's been a few hours

22:23.515 --> 22:25.513
since your last Macho Nacho.

22:25.605 --> 22:26.862
You must be starving.

22:26.868 --> 22:28.343
I was thinking of the molley.

22:28.775 --> 22:31.160
And, um, one more

22:31.166 --> 22:32.293
tiny little favor.

22:32.296 --> 22:34.071
Does it involve me standing
around while you speak French?

22:34.076 --> 22:35.123
'Cause I've already done that.

22:35.125 --> 22:35.650
No, no, no.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.963
I actually just need
your signature.

22:37.978 --> 22:39.890
You see, before I can get divorced,

22:39.935 --> 22:40.913
I have to have someone

22:40.916 --> 22:42.412
attest to my character.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.502
That's in French.

22:43.508 --> 22:44.990
It's just the usual
boilerplate.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.743
You know, never
been to prison

22:46.757 --> 22:47.811
well, me, not you.

22:48.455 --> 22:49.460
Never been married before,

22:49.465 --> 22:50.943
no contact with livestock,

22:50.945 --> 22:51.960
blah, blah, blah.

22:52.145 --> 22:53.252
So I think I have a pen.

22:53.257 --> 22:54.781
Uh, you know, actually, can I sign that after work?

22:54.786 --> 22:55.703
Just leave it here.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.860
Sure. Yes, okay.

22:57.875 --> 22:59.012
Thank you very much.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.451
So you don't speak French at all?

23:02.535 --> 23:03.623
No, why?

23:03.625 --> 23:05.750
Well, it must have been really

23:05.755 --> 23:06.971
boring for you today.

23:07.675 --> 23:08.703
Sorry.

23:18.748 --> 23:20.461
Hey, Seth, man, what's up?

23:20.507 --> 23:21.433
Hey, I got some extra

23:21.436 --> 23:22.371
baba ghanoush.

23:22.436 --> 23:23.512
Oh, baba ghanoush.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.332
No thanks, man.
I'm all right.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.621
- Where's Summer?
- I gave her a little time-out.

23:27.626 --> 23:29.542
It's not easy
having house guests.

23:29.545 --> 23:30.480
What?! I thought you guys

23:30.485 --> 23:31.751
were having this great day,

23:31.836 --> 23:33.053
purchasing luxury goods,

23:33.068 --> 23:34.383
and eating things with faces.

23:34.466 --> 23:36.183
Honestly, could have gone
a little better.

23:36.187 --> 23:37.580
I mean, you know, I support her,

23:37.586 --> 23:38.492
whatever she's into,

23:38.508 --> 23:40.110
but I really need this to work 'cause...

23:40.116 --> 23:41.052
The people have spoken!

23:41.247 --> 23:43.123
We are of one voice,

23:43.128 --> 23:44.332
one mind

23:44.335 --> 23:45.391
and one heart!

23:45.735 --> 23:46.671
Yeah!

23:48.408 --> 23:49.893
I will not sleep,

23:49.995 --> 23:51.082
I will not eat,

23:51.088 --> 23:52.721
I will not rest until

23:52.725 --> 23:53.813
this hypocrisy ends.

23:53.995 --> 23:55.360
Solar panels on all of our

23:55.428 --> 23:56.770
dormitories, or we revolt!

23:56.778 --> 23:58.112
Who's with Summer?

23:58.115 --> 23:59.242
Yeah!

23:59.365 --> 24:03.302
Yeah!

24:14.196 --> 24:15.761
Hey, man, how's your French?

24:15.767 --> 24:16.852
Old Summer's been replaced by

24:16.868 --> 24:17.821
the real Summer,

24:17.827 --> 24:19.950
and she looks suspiciously like
the new Summer.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.762
So she's still in her
"Go Green" phase?

24:21.767 --> 24:22.950
I don't think it's a phase, man.

24:23.075 --> 24:24.380
I think this is her life

24:24.386 --> 24:26.152
now, and it's obvious
I don't fit in it.

24:26.707 --> 24:27.820
Uh, sorry, gotta go.

24:27.957 --> 24:30.780
Hey, wait, I've got to talk to
you about Taylor... what...?

24:33.298 --> 24:34.511
Didn't mean to eavesdrop.

24:34.515 --> 24:35.422
It's okay.

24:35.898 --> 24:37.153
Well, I knew

24:37.157 --> 24:38.052
you were lying last night

24:38.058 --> 24:39.233
when you said nothing was wrong.

24:39.247 --> 24:40.462
Nothing is wrong; you're doing

24:40.477 --> 24:41.480
what people do at college--

24:41.485 --> 24:43.291
discovering who you really are.

24:43.306 --> 24:46.302
Believe me,
I am as surprised as you are.

24:46.736 --> 24:47.671
But I'm still going to shave

24:47.675 --> 24:49.293
my legs and wash my hair,

24:49.297 --> 24:50.712
and be the best girlfriend that I can.

24:50.718 --> 24:51.922
Well, you know, who can ask

24:51.925 --> 24:52.903
for more than that?

24:52.906 --> 24:54.851
Think of all the new subjects
we'll have to talk about.

24:54.867 --> 24:56.102
I did explain the concept of

24:56.108 --> 24:58.030
recycling to you in tenth grade.

24:59.036 --> 25:00.242
See, there's lots of places

25:00.248 --> 25:01.621
where we could use
your help, Cohen.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.751
Please come in. Enter.

25:07.188 --> 25:08.352
Hey... Oh!

25:08.356 --> 25:10.041
You're really nude.

25:10.045 --> 25:11.351
Why don't I... let me come back.

25:11.357 --> 25:13.011
No! Wait right there.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.982
I have a gift for you.

25:16.068 --> 25:17.012
My song.

25:19.577 --> 25:22.213
Polar bears are dying

25:23.567 --> 25:25.611
...two, three, four

25:25.616 --> 25:27.483
Good-bye.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.091
Wow.

25:33.306 --> 25:34.341
Wow.

25:34.345 --> 25:35.341
That's really, uh...

25:35.745 --> 25:36.750
Anyways, listen,

25:36.796 --> 25:38.113
I kind of need your help.

25:38.118 --> 25:40.220
Yeah, bro, one second.

25:40.925 --> 25:42.290
Uh, I'm actually really

25:42.297 --> 25:43.351
honored you would ask me.

25:43.355 --> 25:44.852
Oh, hey, that's cool,

25:44.865 --> 25:46.860
We can shake. We can shake.

25:46.927 --> 25:48.012
And we're touching.

25:50.646 --> 25:52.760
Oh!
Fore!

25:52.837 --> 25:53.932
- Yeah, hi.
- Sorry!

25:54.075 --> 25:55.253
Rob, what are you doing?

25:55.256 --> 25:56.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:57.507 --> 25:58.523
Bye.

26:00.235 --> 26:02.862
I'm sorry about that.
My, my kid's got a rash.

26:02.868 --> 26:05.001
- I got to go to the pharmacy after this.
- Oh, sorry.

26:05.006 --> 26:06.393
Take another one.
It was my fault.

26:06.396 --> 26:07.771
No, no, no!
You're up.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.263
I'll play it from
the parking lot.

26:09.266 --> 26:11.541
- I think I hit your car.
- It'd be an improvement.

26:16.255 --> 26:17.531
Sandy...

26:20.076 --> 26:21.902
You know, my kid doesn't have a rash.

26:24.067 --> 26:25.023
My wife's just calling,

26:25.025 --> 26:26.232
making sure I'm having a good time,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.910
you know, because I don't have

26:27.917 --> 26:29.340
that many guy friends anymore.

26:29.346 --> 26:30.760
Who does?
Who's got the time?

26:30.775 --> 26:32.701
I know, it's work, family,

26:32.706 --> 26:33.893
then more work, you know?

26:33.895 --> 26:34.952
When did it get so hard?

26:34.955 --> 26:36.842
Well, when we were kids,
all you had to do was ask,

26:36.848 --> 26:38.261
hey, want to play
some ball?

26:38.267 --> 26:39.843
And we didn't have
any cell phones.

26:39.847 --> 26:42.152
I turned mine off.
I'm really sorry about that.

26:47.817 --> 26:48.851
Oh!

26:49.557 --> 26:50.702
I'm so sorry, man!

26:50.707 --> 26:51.951
I'm so sorry.

26:52.707 --> 26:53.761
It's the office.

26:53.765 --> 26:54.791
I'm turning it off.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.663
I think I hit your car anyway.

26:57.215 --> 26:58.523
I love this space

26:58.527 --> 27:00.101
and I love the windows.

27:00.498 --> 27:02.120
Plus it's by the beach,
so there'd be lots

27:02.126 --> 27:03.881
of foot traffic and eye candy,

27:03.885 --> 27:04.923
not that I'm looking.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.433
So I'll make an appointment

27:06.438 --> 27:07.370
for us for Monday?

27:09.155 --> 27:10.522
Are you doing anything tonight?

27:10.525 --> 27:12.712
No, Kaitlin's with the twins,

27:12.717 --> 27:13.933
working on a science project,

27:13.947 --> 27:15.740
have the night all to myself.

27:15.745 --> 27:17.181
Well, Sandy's out with a friend.

27:17.316 --> 27:18.382
Do you want to do something?

27:18.788 --> 27:19.693
I don't know

27:19.717 --> 27:20.651
takeout and a movie?

27:20.655 --> 27:21.900
Two women spending Saturday

27:21.908 --> 27:22.830
night at home together.

27:22.847 --> 27:23.782
I love it.

27:23.787 --> 27:25.782
How very Whatever Happened To Baby Jane.

27:33.775 --> 27:35.003
Go ahead, you can take it.

27:35.006 --> 27:35.950
No, that's okay.

27:37.977 --> 27:39.141
Just a sec.

27:43.776 --> 27:44.772
Hello?

27:44.777 --> 27:46.511
It's Taryn.
You joining us tonight?

27:46.817 --> 27:49.051
Uh, actually,

27:49.055 --> 27:50.460
I'm here with Kirsten

27:50.468 --> 27:51.991
and we were thinking about maybe...

27:51.996 --> 27:54.083
Order in and watch a movie?

27:54.598 --> 27:57.650
Oh, honey, even with the wonders

27:57.657 --> 27:58.550
of elective surgery,

27:58.556 --> 28:00.063
you will only be this hot

28:00.066 --> 28:01.013
for so long.

28:01.015 --> 28:02.472
Have fun while you can.

28:04.457 --> 28:05.560
Julie, you still there?

28:05.566 --> 28:06.503
I'll call you back.

28:14.656 --> 28:15.583
Oh, I was just going

28:15.586 --> 28:16.583
to get some takeout menus.

28:16.587 --> 28:18.333
Do you know what
you'd like to eat?

28:18.347 --> 28:20.153
Kirsten, I feel like I'm coming
down with something.

28:20.158 --> 28:21.331
I'm not feeling so hot.

28:21.407 --> 28:22.371
Do you mind if I take a rain

28:22.376 --> 28:23.333
check on our girl's night in?

28:23.778 --> 28:25.791
Julie, did you just put on lipstick?

28:25.795 --> 28:27.601
What? No, uh...

28:28.985 --> 28:29.960
I'm just a little flushed.

28:29.968 --> 28:31.183
I'll call you.

28:36.746 --> 28:38.520
Okay, I think that's the guy.

28:38.528 --> 28:40.271
Kaitlin, what if he's packing heat?

28:40.276 --> 28:41.670
Okay, you guys just stay here.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.620
Money.

28:49.838 --> 28:50.771
Got what we talked about?

28:51.547 --> 28:52.501
In here.

28:52.717 --> 28:54.462
Great, so it's covered in lice and grease.

28:54.587 --> 28:55.640
Put your money in the hat

28:55.655 --> 28:56.710
and try d be cool about it.

28:57.176 --> 28:58.552
You think it's my first buy?

29:00.387 --> 29:01.612
It's been a pleasure.

29:02.927 --> 29:04.551
I'm available,
by the way.

29:06.215 --> 29:07.403
That's heinous.

29:15.236 --> 29:16.691
I don't know
about this, Taryn.

29:16.695 --> 29:17.762
It might be too soon.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.242
Julie, I know how you feel.

29:20.466 --> 29:21.642
But there's one

29:21.648 --> 29:22.961
man who can always

29:22.968 --> 29:24.280
get me out on
the dance floor

29:24.848 --> 29:25.953
His name is Jose.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.500
Jose Cuervo.

29:53.006 --> 29:54.123
Have you met my friend

29:54.528 --> 29:56.550
Julie Cooper-- urban cougar.

30:00.025 --> 30:01.880
Ryan! There you are.

30:01.965 --> 30:02.941
You know, I think there might be

30:02.948 --> 30:03.891
something wrong with your phone.

30:03.896 --> 30:05.330
I called you
three times today.

30:05.336 --> 30:06.582
Six, actually.

30:06.798 --> 30:08.633
Oh, well, um,

30:08.717 --> 30:10.023
did you get a chance

30:10.027 --> 30:12.582
to look at that silly
little document?

30:12.588 --> 30:13.620
Yeah! I did.

30:14.026 --> 30:15.570
And I had a question for you.

30:15.808 --> 30:16.990
Um, what does that mean?

30:18.147 --> 30:20.643
Oh, that's just lawyer speak.

30:20.648 --> 30:22.603
You know, just party of the first part,
party of the second part.

30:22.605 --> 30:24.203
So it doesn't say we had sex, like, 30 times?

30:25.095 --> 30:26.851
Took me like five hours
to translate that.

30:26.857 --> 30:28.501
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

30:28.648 --> 30:29.630
It's just that without

30:29.636 --> 30:30.591
the consent of my husband,

30:30.605 --> 30:31.721
the only way I can get a divorce

30:31.725 --> 30:33.470
is if one of us was unfaithful.

30:33.475 --> 30:34.910
I just didn't think you'd

30:34.915 --> 30:35.893
sign if you knew the truth.

30:35.896 --> 30:37.603
Yeah, well, I've got a lot of

30:37.606 --> 30:39.013
half-eaten enchiladas to clear.

30:39.695 --> 30:41.821
Ryan, I have to meet that lawyer
at the yacht club tonight,

30:41.828 --> 30:42.951
and if I don't have this signed,

30:43.188 --> 30:44.633
I'm going to have
no choice but to go with him

30:44.648 --> 30:46.173
to France and try to work it out

30:46.176 --> 30:47.163
with Henri Michel, face-to-face.

30:47.165 --> 30:48.673
Which means you won't be able to keep coming here,

30:48.675 --> 30:49.643
which is a real shame.

30:49.646 --> 30:51.700
Well, did you at least
read this part

30:51.708 --> 30:53.131
where I said what
a great lover you are?

30:53.147 --> 30:55.892
Look, Taylor... this job,

30:55.898 --> 30:57.071
this is about all

30:57.078 --> 30:58.073
I can handle right now.

30:59.297 --> 31:00.311
You know?

31:07.158 --> 31:08.503
I shouldn't have dragged you in to this.

31:09.028 --> 31:10.152
Yeah, that's what I've been trying to say.

31:10.157 --> 31:11.370
It's just that I...

31:12.967 --> 31:14.330
...don't have anyone else.

31:15.396 --> 31:16.523
It's kind of why I married a

31:16.527 --> 31:17.992
Frenchman in the first place.

31:18.958 --> 31:19.960
I mean, my mom hates me.

31:19.968 --> 31:21.270
I don't really
know my dad,

31:21.275 --> 31:23.082
and last year was the first year
I ever had friends.

31:23.395 --> 31:24.411
All of a sudden, I'm by myself

31:24.418 --> 31:25.572
in a foreign country,

31:25.577 --> 31:27.032
and I meet this guy

31:27.037 --> 31:28.351
who says he loves me.

31:28.396 --> 31:29.730
He wants to take care of me

31:29.735 --> 31:30.853
and... and...

31:31.158 --> 31:33.083
One too many bottles
of Chateau Margot

31:33.088 --> 31:34.841
and a view from
the Eiffel Tower,

31:35.605 --> 31:37.032
and why not?

31:37.305 --> 31:38.820
That's how Tom wooed Katie.

31:38.936 --> 31:40.143
Why not me?

31:46.765 --> 31:48.660
Well, look, I'm sorry you're

31:48.666 --> 31:49.921
going through all this.

31:51.227 --> 31:52.421
I'm just not the guy to help.

31:53.386 --> 31:54.390
Sorry.

32:07.157 --> 32:08.110
Here they come.

32:08.117 --> 32:09.031
There you are.

32:09.036 --> 32:09.992
Sorry we're late.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.462
Earlier today, a caterpillar
entered my room.

32:12.468 --> 32:13.441
I'm happy to say

32:13.536 --> 32:14.851
a butterfly emerged.

32:14.856 --> 32:15.853
Did you know that the

32:15.856 --> 32:17.090
amount of solar energy

32:17.096 --> 32:18.070
that touches the Earth's

32:18.077 --> 32:19.503
surface in 40 minutes

32:19.508 --> 32:21.970
is greater than all the energy

32:21.977 --> 32:25.042
required by the entire
human population in a year?

32:25.046 --> 32:26.881
Yes, I did know that.

32:26.885 --> 32:28.332
It's a thing of beauty, isn't it?

32:28.916 --> 32:29.990
Come on, friends.

32:34.465 --> 32:35.932
Oh, the board only allows

32:35.938 --> 32:36.990
students in the town meeting.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.031
Do you go here?

32:38.375 --> 32:39.440
Uh, no...

32:39.808 --> 32:41.183
But I made this.

32:41.185 --> 32:42.562
Can you just make an exception?

32:42.567 --> 32:43.493
It's for the good of the Earth.

32:43.497 --> 32:44.731
No, I'm afraid not.

32:45.547 --> 32:46.881
Well, it's cool, you go ahead.

32:46.895 --> 32:48.430
But it's your last night here.
You can't spend it alone.

32:48.435 --> 32:49.680
Summer, everybody in there is

32:49.688 --> 32:51.863
counting on you, okay?

32:51.935 --> 32:53.621
I can amuse myself
for a few hours.

32:54.088 --> 32:55.402
You're the best boyfriend ever.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.632
Go change the world.

33:06.216 --> 33:08.461
-This place got great shrimp tacos.
-Oh, yeah?

33:08.585 --> 33:10.460
Looks like you're going to get a chance
to meet one of my kids.

33:10.468 --> 33:11.783
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey

33:11.788 --> 33:13.042
like you meet Spitz

33:14.818 --> 33:16.850
What's up? How about to go to watch the game
get a bite to eat.

33:16.855 --> 33:18.793
- Can you join us?
- Uh, you know, actually,

33:18.798 --> 33:20.141
I'm kind of beat. But you guys go ahead.

33:20.146 --> 33:21.622
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

33:21.896 --> 33:22.942
- I'll be inside.
- Yeah.

33:22.946 --> 33:23.951
Hey, hey.

33:23.956 --> 33:24.960
Is everything okay?

33:24.966 --> 33:26.173
'Cause I'm guessing
not really.

33:26.176 --> 33:27.183
I didn't get fired,

33:27.187 --> 33:29.303
I didn't punch any of my drunken customers,
I'd say I'm great.

33:29.315 --> 33:30.550
One day at a time, one foot

33:30.555 --> 33:31.501
in front of the other.

33:32.096 --> 33:33.240
Eventually, it'll get easier.

33:33.276 --> 33:35.211
Yeah, why, because I'll start
to forget about her?

33:35.217 --> 33:37.020
No, no. You're never going

33:37.028 --> 33:37.932
to forget about her.

33:37.937 --> 33:40.470
But... life goes on.

33:40.675 --> 33:41.641
Not the same life.

33:41.808 --> 33:42.723
No.

33:42.966 --> 33:45.211
But you're going to have
to make this life work.

33:45.215 --> 33:46.330
Yeah, but I do, you know?

33:46.337 --> 33:48.251
I got a job.
I go there, I go home.

33:48.255 --> 33:49.891
I talk to as few people as possible.

33:49.896 --> 33:51.201
If it were only that easy.

33:51.207 --> 33:52.370
Unfortunately for you,

33:52.385 --> 33:53.963
getting mixed up in
other people's lives,

33:53.967 --> 33:55.120
helping them out of jams,

33:56.105 --> 33:57.332
it seems to be what you do,

33:57.397 --> 33:58.372
like it or not.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.971
I'd hate to see you turn your back on that.

34:01.156 --> 34:02.870
It'd be like turning your back on yourself.

34:03.587 --> 34:05.121
Come on, join us, would you?

34:05.258 --> 34:06.271
Get a little food, watch

34:06.277 --> 34:07.590
the second half of the game.

34:07.598 --> 34:09.303
Actually, there's something I've got to do.

34:09.806 --> 34:11.333
Uh, you guys have fun.

34:11.396 --> 34:13.072
- All right.
- All right.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.061
just pay inside.

34:19.065 --> 34:20.350
Let me do the talking, okay?

34:21.946 --> 34:23.719
You got an I.D.?

34:25.905 --> 34:27.150
It's cool.

34:27.157 --> 34:28.722
Cover's 20 bucks, just pay inside.

34:28.737 --> 34:29.690
Cool.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.243
Sorry, boys, not tonight.

34:32.248 --> 34:33.471
What? Why?

34:33.476 --> 34:35.842
I'm sorry, is there a problem
with their I.D.'s?

34:35.848 --> 34:36.751
Because they're with me.

34:36.755 --> 34:37.670
There's a problem with them.

34:37.846 --> 34:39.713
See, I have the right to refuse entry to anybody.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.793
And tonight that includes dorks and virgins.

34:41.797 --> 34:43.882
- So just beat it, guys.
- Fine. Whatever, man.

34:43.887 --> 34:45.812
- That blows.
- Come on, Kaitlin, let's go.

34:45.815 --> 34:47.400
Yeah, you can't go in there without us.

34:48.685 --> 34:50.030
Who's going to protect you?

34:52.318 --> 34:53.951
See you guys later.

34:55.338 --> 34:57.081
Need you to move aside, guys.

36:08.536 --> 36:10.143
Go! Go, go, go!

36:12.237 --> 36:13.503
Man.

36:15.408 --> 36:16.590
This is great.

36:16.598 --> 36:18.283
Watching the game, having a beer.

36:18.286 --> 36:19.321
For five minutes,

36:19.326 --> 36:20.661
the sky isn't falling.

36:20.715 --> 36:21.960
A chance to be stupid again.

36:21.968 --> 36:23.090
Here's to being stupid

36:23.098 --> 36:24.181
for five minutes.

36:26.655 --> 36:28.092
- Hey, honey.
- How's it going?

36:28.098 --> 36:29.871
Great. Spitz just told me a story

36:29.877 --> 36:31.520
about how his kid's walked in
on him and his wife

36:31.535 --> 36:33.090
when they were playing
Strip Scrabble.

36:33.095 --> 36:34.172
Strip Scrabble?

36:34.736 --> 36:36.080
I'm glad things are going well.

36:36.097 --> 36:37.031
Yeah.

36:37.036 --> 36:38.522
So how are you doing?
You having fun with Julie?

36:38.528 --> 36:39.933
Well, Julie had

36:39.936 --> 36:41.340
a mysterious illness.

36:41.347 --> 36:42.832
So I'm home alone.

36:42.847 --> 36:44.190
I just finished watching a movie

36:44.197 --> 36:45.330
and I thought I'd check in.

36:45.336 --> 36:46.362
I love you.

36:46.707 --> 36:47.833
I love you.

36:47.938 --> 36:48.970
Bye.

37:00.626 --> 37:01.961
I don't love him.

37:03.048 --> 37:04.083
I never did.

37:04.087 --> 37:06.561
I was just scared.

37:09.526 --> 37:10.461
Sorry I'm late.

37:25.518 --> 37:27.112
You have that paper for me to sign?

37:31.165 --> 37:32.360
It won't be necessary.

37:33.407 --> 37:35.652
I may be a lawyer,
but I'm also a Frenchman.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.202
I know love when
I see it.

37:38.028 --> 37:39.362
I will inform Henri Michel.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.963
- Ryan, I...
- Don't worry about it.

37:45.608 --> 37:46.640
Yeah.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.150
We stand before you,

37:58.156 --> 37:59.713
an organized student body.

37:59.715 --> 38:01.122
We have a question.

38:01.236 --> 38:03.513
Where does this burden fall?

38:07.715 --> 38:09.270
Hey, sleepyhead.

38:11.647 --> 38:12.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:12.745 --> 38:13.723
Did we win?

38:13.735 --> 38:15.831
Not yet, but Che suggested
a filibuster,

38:15.837 --> 38:17.541
so it could go on all night.

38:17.548 --> 38:18.623
I think we got 'em.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.082
- That's great.
- Yeah.

38:20.087 --> 38:21.441
When I showed them my cost

38:21.445 --> 38:22.522
benefit analysis chart,

38:22.527 --> 38:23.940
jaws actually dropped.

38:24.265 --> 38:25.221
Of course they did.

38:25.407 --> 38:26.641
There's all these old people in there

38:26.655 --> 38:27.871
that are actually listening to me.

38:27.878 --> 38:28.773
Me!

38:28.776 --> 38:30.580
It felt better than
when I got 70% off

38:30.586 --> 38:32.403
that Marc Jacobs dress
with the broken zipper.

38:32.626 --> 38:33.961
I wish I could have been there.

38:34.028 --> 38:35.962
Instead you slept in the hallway

38:35.965 --> 38:37.593
on your last night in Providence.

38:37.717 --> 38:38.653
I'm totally fine.

38:38.655 --> 38:39.812
Listen, go back in there and

38:39.817 --> 38:41.393
knock it out of the park.

38:41.537 --> 38:42.831
Was that a sports reference?

38:42.835 --> 38:43.851
Maybe.

38:44.537 --> 38:46.323
See, I know people can change.

39:08.277 --> 39:09.312
Yeah?

39:10.706 --> 39:12.863
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you asleep?

39:13.037 --> 39:14.132
No.

39:14.248 --> 39:16.812
Oh, well, then my timing is impeccable, as always.

39:19.115 --> 39:20.660
So I wanted to thank you.

39:20.668 --> 39:23.540
So I made you peach torte.

39:26.108 --> 39:27.081
Yeah, after I got married,

39:27.087 --> 39:29.243
Henri Michel made me take a
cooking class.

39:29.277 --> 39:31.550
Um, I failed everything
except tortes.

39:31.558 --> 39:33.630
- Tortes I rocked.
- Uh, well, that's great, but, um...

39:33.638 --> 39:35.240
You're not a dessert guy.
Okay.

39:35.245 --> 39:36.502
Well, um, I could make

39:36.506 --> 39:37.942
you lunch, or... dinner.

39:37.947 --> 39:39.391
I have to pay you back somehow.

39:39.397 --> 39:40.340
I love dessert.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.690
Okay.

39:45.877 --> 39:46.882
Fork.

39:46.886 --> 39:47.952
Thanks.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.922
Yeah? All right.

39:53.306 --> 39:54.420
Wow.

39:55.225 --> 39:56.523
Who would have thought,
six months ago,

39:56.525 --> 39:57.682
you and I, sitting here,

39:57.715 --> 39:58.803
sharing a torte.

39:59.127 --> 40:00.412
Not me.

40:00.587 --> 40:02.081
You know, at graduation,

40:02.088 --> 40:03.521
in my commencement address,

40:03.526 --> 40:05.713
I said there's no one older than

40:05.718 --> 40:06.712
a high school senior,

40:06.718 --> 40:08.701
no one younger than
a college freshman.

40:08.705 --> 40:09.640
It was one of the few parts

40:09.646 --> 40:10.581
that wasn't in Latin.

40:10.837 --> 40:13.800
And uh, it's true.

40:14.835 --> 40:15.902
Because I feel like everything

40:15.906 --> 40:17.392
I thought I knew,

40:17.585 --> 40:20.133
everything that I expected,

40:20.138 --> 40:21.111
is just kind of gone

40:21.688 --> 40:23.172
out the window.

40:25.737 --> 40:28.001
Yeah, life is definitely unpredictable.

40:32.658 --> 40:33.642
But I guess I'm realizing that

40:33.645 --> 40:34.693
that could be a good thing.

40:35.176 --> 40:36.162
You know?

40:36.166 --> 40:37.393
Because it's exciting not

40:37.397 --> 40:38.650
knowing what's going to happen.

40:38.655 --> 40:40.013
Taylor, this is a great torte.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.643
Really good.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.142
Can I have the next flight

40:53.145 --> 40:54.352
to John Wayne Airport, please?

40:55.205 --> 40:56.611
8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

41:14.635 --> 41:15.943
Come on.

42:17.945 --> 42:18.983
Hey, Summer.

42:19.086 --> 42:21.762
I know flying home early
is your move, but I stole it.

42:22.147 --> 42:24.200
I just wanted to give you room
to keep doing

42:24.208 --> 42:26.012
what you're doing, because
I think it's pretty amazing.

42:26.018 --> 42:28.552
So if you don't hear from me
for a while, it's not because

42:28.557 --> 42:30.400
I don't love you,
it's because I do.
