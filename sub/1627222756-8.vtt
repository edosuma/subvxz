so she goes out and buys them

44:50.183 --> 44:51.881
a little bit of time.

44:51.924 --> 44:56.450
Christian Serratos, she is one
of our best action fighters.

44:56.494 --> 44:59.497
She just really, like,
dove into the role and, like,

44:59.540 --> 45:01.586
learned how to handle
every weapon.

45:01.629 --> 45:03.806
So she's just great
at all of that.

45:03.849 --> 45:07.723
And we just thought it'd be
really fun to kind of

45:07.766 --> 45:10.813
have her go out
and kind of kick ass.

45:10.856 --> 45:12.771
[Thunder rumbles]

45:12.815 --> 45:15.861
We really felt like it'd be
great to have Virgil

45:15.905 --> 45:19.169
and Judith connect here,
and I think that the moment

45:19.212 --> 45:21.519
is just really very poignant.

45:21.562 --> 45:25.088
It's easy in a show, sometimes,
to just kind of be like,

45:25.131 --> 45:26.742
"Well, that person's gone."

45:26.785 --> 45:31.747
But I don't feel like that's how
grief just works in life.

45:31.790 --> 45:34.227
My mother passed away
when I was a teenager

45:34.271 --> 45:37.361
and I still think about her
every single day of my life.

45:37.404 --> 45:40.494
And it's meaningful to be able
to talk about those people

45:40.538 --> 45:43.193
that you love and miss,
and to have people

45:43.236 --> 45:44.847
talk about them to you.

45:44.890 --> 45:46.457
I just wish she was here.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.937
Virgil: She is.

45:47.980 --> 45:50.766
I see her in the way
you hold your sword.

45:50.809 --> 45:53.812
"The Walking Dead,"
it's this show with zombies

45:53.856 --> 45:56.859
but it's also just,
it's really about the people

45:56.902 --> 45:59.339
and who you love
and about family.

45:59.383 --> 46:02.778
And so, for Judith, it would be
important to be able to, like,

46:02.821 --> 46:05.519
talk about Michonne, because she
misses her so very much

46:05.563 --> 46:07.130
and still believes
she's out there

46:07.173 --> 46:09.349
and believes she's gonna
come home some day.

46:09.393 --> 46:11.090
Your mama's
still with you.

46:11.134 --> 46:12.483
And you can bet

46:12.526 --> 46:17.531
that wherever she is,
you're with her.

46:17.575 --> 46:20.926
The thing that we wanted to show
with this story is that

46:20.970 --> 46:23.146
Daryl and Leah,
in a lot of ways,

46:23.189 --> 46:25.104
have exactly the same attitude.

46:25.148 --> 46:28.412
They may have once had a
romantic relationship,

46:28.455 --> 46:32.024
but they're never gonna choose
each other over the people

46:32.068 --> 46:34.679
that they have loved
and fought for,

46:34.722 --> 46:37.856
because they simply cannot
really trust each other.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.771
There's sort of like,
a toxicity

46:39.815 --> 46:41.338
at the base of that
relationship.

46:41.381 --> 46:45.559
And so, when Daryl tells Leah it
is absolutely a gamble.

46:45.603 --> 46:48.388
He doesn't know what the outcome
is gonna be.

46:48.432 --> 46:52.784
What he has seen of her,
in the more recent episodes,

46:52.828 --> 46:55.569
is that
there is that core to her

46:55.613 --> 46:59.399
that still believes in things
that are not just what

46:59.443 --> 47:01.184
the Reapers believe.

47:01.227 --> 47:04.361
I think that he sees that there
is still a good person in there,

47:04.404 --> 47:08.365
there is somebody that is still
emotionally affected

47:08.408 --> 47:12.195
by pain and suffering,
who cares about other people

47:12.238 --> 47:14.023
and is protective.

47:14.066 --> 47:17.374
And, Daryl doesn't really have
the heart to try to kill her

47:17.417 --> 47:20.290
right there,
and so the best thing he can do

47:20.333 --> 47:22.901
is to try to bring her in on it.

47:22.945 --> 47:25.295
There's people down there
walking with the dead.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.385
My people.

47:28.428 --> 47:31.779
In his mind, he thinks either
she's going to help me

47:31.823 --> 47:33.172
or she doesn't.

47:33.216 --> 47:36.132
Either way there's going to be a
battle here,

47:36.175 --> 47:39.222
but I feel like,
at this moment in time,

47:39.265 --> 47:43.095
I might be able to gain more by
telling her what's going on

47:43.139 --> 47:44.836
then by not telling her.

47:44.880 --> 47:48.013
In this case, it does help
in the short term, you know.

47:48.057 --> 47:50.450
And it does help
with a major problem.

47:50.494 --> 47:54.063
It causes its own problems,
but if he hadn't told her

47:54.106 --> 47:59.938
he would've had
that problem anyway.

47:59.982 --> 48:01.635
[Grunts]
[Groans]

48:01.679 --> 48:04.638
Leah does kill Pope and Daryl
was right,

48:04.682 --> 48:08.599
Leah was at a place where she
was willing to help him

48:08.642 --> 48:11.645
with that because Pope was
too far gone.

48:11.689 --> 48:14.866
But when he threw that knife
into the heart

48:14.910 --> 48:19.610
of Ancheta's chest,
it became this reminder for her

48:19.653 --> 48:23.875
of, "yes, he was right about
Pope, but how many of my people

48:23.919 --> 48:29.272
have died because of this Maggie
coming back into these walls?

48:29.315 --> 48:31.274
How many more of my people are
going to die?"

48:31.317 --> 48:34.451
And she cannot bear that
because at the end of the day,

48:34.494 --> 48:38.020
Daryl chose his family
and she chose hers.

48:38.063 --> 48:39.369
Pope is dead.

48:39.412 --> 48:40.892
Dixon murdered him.

48:40.936 --> 48:43.155
He's with the enemy.

48:43.199 --> 48:45.810
It's a really complex situation

48:45.853 --> 48:48.682
because it's like, they don't
even try to kill each other.

48:48.726 --> 48:50.075
Like, she doesn't
try to kill him

48:50.119 --> 48:52.077
and nor does he try to kill her.

48:52.121 --> 48:55.385
But, this was never gonna turn
out right.

48:55.428 --> 48:57.300
But in some ways,
she gives him a chance

48:57.343 --> 49:00.433
to have enough of a head start
to have a fair fight.

49:00.477 --> 49:02.870
Where's Leah gonna end at the
end of all of this?

49:02.914 --> 49:06.265
I think is just the question
that we've gotta see

49:06.309 --> 49:08.180
when we get into Episode 9.
