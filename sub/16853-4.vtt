WEBVTT

00:02.304 --> 00:04.442
Lola, we have some
good news and some bad news.

00:04.510 --> 00:06.179
The good news is, you
don't have cancer.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.282
- Ohh!
- Cat just put nair in your shampoo.

00:08.351 --> 00:10.183
Because you ate my lunch
from the refrigerator.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.453
And the bad news is, she
also put a chemical in your

00:12.522 --> 00:15.726
iced tea which turns your
nose into a tennis ball.

00:15.761 --> 00:17.093
But it only lasts a second.

00:17.129 --> 00:18.729
So basically, everything's okay.

00:18.764 --> 00:20.565
Everything's okay.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.174
Chief!

00:27.210 --> 00:29.175
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:31.379 --> 00:34.012
Sometimes I
wish I was a mirror.

00:34.132 --> 00:39.200

00:39.320 --> 00:41.557
Hey, Dori, my
round sheet is empty.

00:41.677 --> 00:42.543
Is that a mistake?

00:42.578 --> 00:44.068
Doesn't look like it.

00:44.188 --> 00:46.377
This place is empty.
What gives?

00:46.497 --> 00:49.834
There are no admissions today,
and we just discharged the last child.

00:49.954 --> 00:52.189
Are you saying there are no
more patients left in the hospital?

00:52.224 --> 00:54.458
Guys, what do we
do with all our time?

00:54.527 --> 00:57.662
Listen, I'm going into town
to register the new ambulance.

00:57.698 --> 00:58.730
Sy! Sy! Sy!

00:58.765 --> 01:01.032
Before you go, there are
no patients left to treat.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.935
Any extra tasks you
need us doing?

01:02.970 --> 01:05.137
As a matter of fact,
thank you, Glenn.

01:05.173 --> 01:06.972
There's a <i>lot</i> of
things to be done.

01:07.041 --> 01:10.018
First off, the organ supply
room needs cleaning.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.423
I'll do it!

01:11.543 --> 01:12.158
Psych!

01:12.278 --> 01:13.208
Wear gloves this time.

01:13.328 --> 01:14.234
I'll do it my own way.

01:14.354 --> 01:18.617
And then, most importantly,
the patients' records, all right?

01:18.652 --> 01:20.985
Now, look at this --
completely disorganized.

01:21.054 --> 01:24.688
These have been handed down from
administrator to administrator.

01:24.724 --> 01:26.891
You know how important
this is to me.

01:26.926 --> 01:30.161
Glenn, will you take care of
reorganizing this entire room?

01:30.230 --> 01:33.531
I will not
let you down, sir.

01:33.566 --> 01:36.801
I would never have asked you,
son, if I didn't believe in you.

01:36.836 --> 01:38.602
Are they falling in love?

01:38.638 --> 01:39.170
Yes.

01:39.205 --> 01:41.806
All right, Glenn is
in charge, everybody.

01:41.841 --> 01:44.075
And these files better be
perfect when I get back.

01:44.110 --> 01:45.910
I'd rather
clean monkey crap.

01:45.979 --> 01:47.178
You know what, Lola?

01:47.213 --> 01:48.445
That is a great idea.

01:48.481 --> 01:51.081
The animal-testing
lab is filthy.

01:52.117 --> 01:54.918
Should have said, "I'd rather
clean the Dylan McDermott lab."

01:54.987 --> 01:56.553
Who's gonna come with me?

01:56.589 --> 01:57.621
It's a great adventure.

01:57.690 --> 01:58.689
Dori! Perfect!

01:58.725 --> 01:59.624
Ohh!

01:59.659 --> 02:01.059
Let's go!

02:03.562 --> 02:05.464
Hey, Rosa.

02:05.499 --> 02:06.999
Working hard or hardly working?

02:07.034 --> 02:11.604
Oh,
somewhere in between, Mr. Dr. Downs.

02:11.639 --> 02:13.106
I see what you're saying.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.842
You're not working as hard as you
<i>can</i> be, but you're certainly

02:15.911 --> 02:16.710
<i>not</i> working.

02:18.113 --> 02:19.112
Oof.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.115
This uterus expired on Tuesday.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.383
You know what?

02:22.451 --> 02:23.918
I figure we have a
10-day grace period.

02:23.953 --> 02:26.020
Expiration dates are
really just suggestions.

02:26.089 --> 02:28.389
I like the way
you think, lady.

02:28.458 --> 02:31.926
You know, being around all
these organs is making me hungry.

02:31.962 --> 02:35.463
Would you like to come
to my home for lunch?

02:36.933 --> 02:39.035
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

02:39.070 --> 02:40.036
<i>My dick.</i>

02:40.071 --> 02:41.538
<i>That is all.</i>

02:41.573 --> 02:42.739
<i>Hey, chief.</i>

02:42.808 --> 02:43.740
<i>Oh.</i>

02:43.775 --> 02:45.475
<i>Owen isn't interested in me.</i>

02:45.544 --> 02:47.911
<i>Do you think he noticed
I use a walker?</i>

02:47.946 --> 02:51.114
<i>Oh, I'd love to
girl-gab, but I just injected</i>

02:51.150 --> 02:54.184
<i>all these stem cells into
that handicapped monkey.</i>

02:55.488 --> 02:58.222
<i>He doesn't need
glasses or his walker?!</i>

02:59.626 --> 03:02.027
<i>Stem cells cure handicaps!</i>

03:02.095 --> 03:02.861
<i>Mama want!</i>

03:02.930 --> 03:04.496
<i>No! Chief, no!</i>

03:04.532 --> 03:05.030
<i>Oh, God!</i>

03:07.034 --> 03:08.500
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

03:08.536 --> 03:10.036
<i>I don't feel anything at all.</i>

03:10.104 --> 03:12.037
<i>Thanks for nothing, whore!</i>

03:13.940 --> 03:15.508
<i>Wait. Chief.</i>

03:15.543 --> 03:17.009
<i>Think fast!</i>

03:18.947 --> 03:19.779
<i>Amazing!</i>

03:19.814 --> 03:21.514
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:21.549 --> 03:23.116
<i>Look at that.</i>

03:23.151 --> 03:24.150
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:24.185 --> 03:25.852
<i>I'm cured!</i>

03:25.887 --> 03:28.054
<i>Stem cells? What a great idea!</i>

03:28.090 --> 03:29.422
<i>Okay.</i>

03:29.458 --> 03:30.423
<i>What do you say, guys?</i>

03:30.492 --> 03:31.057
<i>Let's get busy!</i>

03:31.092 --> 03:32.792
<i>I'm not doing donkey dick.</i>

03:32.827 --> 03:34.694
<i>Look, Cat --
What part of "donkey</i>

03:34.729 --> 03:36.062
<i>dick" don't you
understand, ass-kisser?!</i>

03:36.131 --> 03:36.930
<i>All right.</i>

03:36.965 --> 03:38.064
<i>So, how do you want to do this?</i>

03:38.100 --> 03:42.035
<i>My favorite letters are I, T, V, Q, and S,
so, obviously, I'll take -- aaaah!</i>

03:42.071 --> 03:42.969
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

03:43.005 --> 03:45.172
<i>For a second there, I thought
that was a real airplane.</i>

03:45.240 --> 03:46.139
<i>What's the deal, Cat?</i>

03:46.208 --> 03:48.709
<i>Glenn, this is a free day!</i>

03:48.744 --> 03:52.613
<i>I mean, do you really want to
spend it organizing records, or</i>

03:52.681 --> 03:55.082
<i>do you want to spend
setting them?</i>

03:55.151 --> 03:56.617
<i>Am I right, guys?</i>

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074

04:06.025 --> 04:07.359
<i>Okay, let's go!</i>

04:10.965 --> 04:12.998
<i>Come on, guys!</i>

04:13.033 --> 04:16.635
<i>Are we doctors or are we...
Dart doctors?</i>

04:21.575 --> 04:25.811
No! No, no, no!

04:25.879 --> 04:27.913
The ladies' room is right there!

04:27.949 --> 04:29.982
Sy, where are you?

04:30.017 --> 04:31.984
Ha-cha-cha!

04:33.020 --> 04:35.454
Whew.

04:35.489 --> 04:37.089
Ooh. Hey, there.

04:37.124 --> 04:38.424
You new at this hospital?

04:38.459 --> 04:39.191
In a way.

04:39.227 --> 04:41.827
What's your
name, beautiful?

04:41.896 --> 04:42.895
My name?

04:42.930 --> 04:48.901
Uh, I-- it's... it's, uh, uh...

04:48.970 --> 04:51.971
My name...
Ooh, I -- ouch.

04:52.006 --> 04:54.173
It's, uh... hey.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.108
Uh...it's chief.

04:56.177 --> 04:59.478
Uh, chief...Smith.

04:59.514 --> 05:00.012
Oh.

05:00.081 --> 05:02.915
Well, we have another lady here
named chief, but she's ugly.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.016
Oh, really?

05:04.051 --> 05:04.817
Yeah.

05:04.852 --> 05:06.919
She's about as ugly
as a big pile of poo.

05:06.988 --> 05:07.754
Oh.

05:07.789 --> 05:08.655
Mm-hmm.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.457
She's so ugly, a
poo takes a her.

05:10.492 --> 05:11.091
Hmm.

05:11.126 --> 05:13.993
If a dog wanted to eat
his own poo, he would make a

05:14.029 --> 05:15.028
mistake and eat <i>her.</i>

05:15.063 --> 05:15.895
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:15.931 --> 05:18.532
For all intents and
purposes, she is <i>poo.</i>

05:18.567 --> 05:19.399
Ohhh.

05:19.435 --> 05:21.401
When she goes to the
toilet store, they tell her to

05:21.470 --> 05:23.104
"go around back 'cause that's
where we let the poo in."

05:23.172 --> 05:23.904
Oh, God.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.007
If you do a Google image
search of the word "poo,"

05:26.043 --> 05:29.744
pictures of poo show up, but
then there's a picture of her.

05:29.813 --> 05:30.912
Mm.

05:30.947 --> 05:32.480
Crazy people smear
<i>her</i> on the walls.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.015
There's more.

05:37.853 --> 05:39.087
Hi!
Hi.

05:39.122 --> 05:40.488
We're hungry, mama!

05:40.557 --> 05:41.489
We're hungry!

05:41.558 --> 05:43.558
They're saying
they're hungry.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.593
Yeah, yeah.

05:44.661 --> 05:45.594
No, I heard them.

05:45.629 --> 05:46.595
They spoke English.

05:46.631 --> 05:48.464
Come and sit.

05:48.500 --> 05:52.035
Back in Ukraine, I was
hospital administrator.

05:52.070 --> 05:53.469
I loved it so.

05:53.505 --> 05:55.137
Oh, thank you, grandma.

05:55.206 --> 05:57.940
I work at Childrens just to
be around the administrating.

05:57.975 --> 06:00.776
Sort of like a
lower-stakes "Good Will Hunting."

06:00.812 --> 06:01.677
Exactly.

06:01.746 --> 06:03.679
Yeah.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.850
Mmm. This soup is incredible.

06:07.886 --> 06:09.418
Is there a secret ingredient?

06:09.454 --> 06:11.420
Oh, yes.

06:14.058 --> 06:16.025
Love.

06:27.072 --> 06:28.972
Glenn, come on.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.607
Let yourself go.

06:30.642 --> 06:32.142
- Ahh...
- Dance.

06:32.177 --> 06:33.710
Oh, you know what?

06:33.779 --> 06:34.511
You're right.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.579
The files can wait.

06:35.614 --> 06:36.446
I got to dance!

06:36.515 --> 06:38.581
I <i>got</i> to dance!

06:45.589 --> 06:47.957
Whoa, Glenn!

06:47.992 --> 06:49.792
Yeah!

06:49.827 --> 06:51.794
All right!

07:02.705 --> 07:04.606
What?!

07:04.641 --> 07:06.341
Hey!

07:06.410 --> 07:08.610
Pool! Pool!

07:08.645 --> 07:09.644
Aah!

07:15.752 --> 07:17.819
Free day!

07:17.854 --> 07:19.621
Thank you so much, Sasha.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.422
Really nice meeting
you, Andrash.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.358
And you, too, Tiffany.

07:23.426 --> 07:24.993
Don't ever change.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.795
And you...

07:26.830 --> 07:28.797
This day has been wonderful.

07:34.771 --> 07:35.370
No!

07:35.439 --> 07:36.972
But we -- we
have a connection.

07:37.007 --> 07:38.641
I'm Robin Williams,
you're Matt Damon.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.543
Let's make love, like
they did in the movie.

07:40.578 --> 07:41.377
No! No!

07:41.446 --> 07:42.612
I don't like you like that!

07:42.647 --> 07:43.746
Please, Dr. Blake, leave!

07:43.781 --> 07:45.648
Let me kiss
her on the mouth!

07:45.683 --> 07:49.452
Rosa! No! No! No!

07:49.487 --> 07:50.753
No!

07:50.789 --> 07:53.822
Mwah! Mwah!

07:53.891 --> 07:54.823
No!

07:55.993 --> 08:00.563
I'll tell you what, chief Smith,
I'm gonna go get us some mai tais.

08:00.632 --> 08:01.898
Don't you go anywhere.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.667
Don't you worry.

08:03.736 --> 08:05.002
Rowr!

08:06.539 --> 08:07.771
Mmm.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.474
Hey! Think fast!

08:10.910 --> 08:11.675
Wait a minute.

08:11.711 --> 08:13.844
Let me put on my -- my glasses.

08:13.913 --> 08:17.381
Poo chief, where
did chief Smith go?!

08:17.417 --> 08:19.383
You got to help me find her!

08:19.452 --> 08:20.751
Her is me!

08:20.820 --> 08:22.853
Her is me!

08:22.922 --> 08:26.590
♪ For your sins ♪

08:26.659 --> 08:29.126
Hey, Blake,
where have you been?

08:29.162 --> 08:32.929
Well, let's just say
that I've been to another world

08:32.965 --> 08:37.467
and I fell in love, and it was not
mutual, and I was forcibly removed.

08:37.503 --> 08:38.602
Aw, sweet.

08:38.671 --> 08:40.871
Are those
patients' files?

08:40.940 --> 08:41.839
Yeah.

08:41.874 --> 08:44.875
Why are you throwing
them into the fire?!

08:44.911 --> 08:46.510
Don't you get it?

08:46.545 --> 08:47.411
I don't know.

08:48.547 --> 08:49.947
Sy's on his way back.

08:50.016 --> 08:53.117
If only any of us knew
something about administrating,

08:53.152 --> 08:54.485
then we could fix this.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.585
Wait a minute!

08:55.621 --> 08:56.586
Guys, I have an idea.

08:56.621 --> 08:58.888
Wait right here, okay?

08:58.957 --> 09:00.590
Do you have a sec?

09:00.658 --> 09:01.791
No.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.526
Come on.

09:03.595 --> 09:04.861
Everybody, this is Rosa.

09:04.896 --> 09:05.962
She's my girlfriend.

09:06.031 --> 09:07.030
She can fix this.

09:07.065 --> 09:08.698
Not your girlfriend.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.133
Blake told me the situation.

09:10.168 --> 09:13.336
We would have to re-create all
the files by calling every

09:13.405 --> 09:15.672
patient and getting
their medical history.

09:15.707 --> 09:16.673
It's impossible.

09:16.709 --> 09:17.874
Oh, I failed.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.576
Impossible?

09:19.612 --> 09:23.579
Nothing's impossible if
you follow your heart.

09:23.615 --> 09:25.080
Not even love.

09:25.115 --> 09:25.781
Hi.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.515
I'm calling from
Childrens hospital.

09:27.584 --> 09:29.617
I was wondering, were you
ever a patient here?

09:29.653 --> 09:31.586
And when was his
last vaccination?

09:31.621 --> 09:33.855
What do you think
your weight was in 1975?

09:33.890 --> 09:34.889
I'm still at work.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.091
We have to re-create these
stupid patient files we burned

09:37.160 --> 09:38.059
in a hallway campfire.

09:38.094 --> 09:40.962
She's so ugly that
monkeys take <i>her</i> out of their

09:40.997 --> 09:43.598
butts and throw <i>her</i> at
people at the zoo.

09:43.634 --> 09:45.533
And that's it.

09:45.602 --> 09:46.634
We did it!

09:46.670 --> 09:47.068
Ohh!

09:47.137 --> 09:47.902
We did it!

09:47.938 --> 09:48.803
That's it?!

09:48.839 --> 09:49.804
We replaced all the files?

09:49.840 --> 09:52.874
No, just this one single file, but
you act like it's not that impressive.

09:52.910 --> 09:53.976
Glenn!

09:54.011 --> 09:56.011
What the hell happened here?!

09:56.080 --> 09:58.447
Sy, it's fault--
No, Cat.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.414
Oh.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.083
I got to own this.

10:01.118 --> 10:02.885
Yeah, we burned the files.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.788
And we'd do it again, 'cause,
news flash, Sy -- I don't want

10:06.823 --> 10:12.993
to run your hospital, 'cause
as a surgeon, I make <i>sick</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:17.731
<i>money, and you live in a condo
at the Harborlight Mall.</i>

10:17.800 --> 10:23.970
<i>I admit it. I was wr--
I was wr-- I was wro--</i>

10:24.006 --> 10:25.639
<i>Sy's having a stroke!</i>

10:25.674 --> 10:26.740
<i>Everybody come quick!</i>

10:26.808 --> 10:28.908
<i>I got it! I got it!</i>

10:28.944 --> 10:30.644
<i>No! No! No!</i>

10:30.679 --> 10:31.712
<i>Thank you, Rosa.</i>

10:31.747 --> 10:32.546
<i>You've been great.</i>

10:32.581 --> 10:34.648
<i>I did literally nothing
and nothing got fixed.</i>

10:34.716 --> 10:35.849
<i>Eh, tomayto, tomahto.</i>

10:35.917 --> 10:38.818
<i>No, I just had trouble
saying I was wrong.</i>

10:38.854 --> 10:39.719
<i>It's a tic.</i>

10:39.755 --> 10:42.188
<i>Eh, it's a living.</i>

11:06.457 --> 11:07.990
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

11:08.026 --> 11:09.225
<i>When I say "That is,"</i>

11:09.260 --> 11:10.192
<i>you say "All."</i>

11:10.228 --> 11:14.063
<i>That is... that is all.</i>
