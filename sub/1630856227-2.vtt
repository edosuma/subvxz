00:02.000 --> 00:03.440
This programme contains some scenes

00:03.440 --> 00:05.800
which some viewers may find upsetting and some violent scenes

00:05.800 --> 00:07.320
This is Alpha operator. Firing rocket.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.560
His Highness will be very happy.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.240
Dixon, this is Grainger. What are you doing?

00:11.480 --> 00:13.760
Alpha R-PAS is firing on the ground team.

00:13.760 --> 00:14.920
Seven confirmed fatalities.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.880
They've got the man they think's responsible,

00:16.880 --> 00:18.840
they're holding him on-site. I didn't do this.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.960
Who were the other pilots?

00:19.960 --> 00:23.600
Captain Sam Kader and Flight Lieutenant Callum Barker.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.360
They're back in in Al-Shawka airbase in Wudyan.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.720
So, is that it, then? We're all suspects?

00:28.720 --> 00:31.400
Of course we are! This was our operation!

00:31.400 --> 00:35.840
The next pilot to take control was Anthony Chapman.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.360
And where's Anthony Chapman now?

00:39.280 --> 00:41.920
He flew back here with his daughter two days ago.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.640
There was a trespasser on the perimeter during the test.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.400
If there's any chance they're still out there, we need to find them.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.520
Police! Stay where you are!

00:49.520 --> 00:54.120
Officers searched your flat under warrant and came across these.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.600
These are prescriptions for medicines,

00:56.600 --> 00:58.320
written by Dr Mohammed Rajab.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.000
I imagine these are all being used as some sort of code?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.520
Hello, everyone. I'm Ramsay.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.560
I wasn't sure which Service you were from,

01:04.560 --> 01:07.080
but the whole smug-schoolboy shit...

01:07.080 --> 01:11.400
MI5, right? We did get the GPS data that the R-PAS Chapman got on to.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.440
There's a little village in the Trossachs.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.920
Any sign of Sabiha Chapman? No, it's OK. It's fine.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.640
Compton, we found her. Get down her now.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.120
GUN CLICKS

01:20.640 --> 01:23.120
Run. Go!

01:23.120 --> 01:24.440
GUNSHOTS

01:27.560 --> 01:29.040
GUNSHOT, YELPING

01:32.560 --> 01:35.360
No, wait! No, we have to keep going.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.840
No, you go! I can't run any more! Get down.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.200
I'm sorry!

01:39.200 --> 01:41.920
If we split up, you two have a chance.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.600
I love you. You talk to him. You keep him distracted.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.960
Get back, get back.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.080
I'm a police detective!

01:56.080 --> 01:59.920
Put down your weapon! We've got armed officers coming!

02:02.960 --> 02:06.400
Murdering two police officers is a whole-life tariff!

02:06.400 --> 02:08.440
You'll die in prison! Come out!

02:08.440 --> 02:09.880
Move back!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.800
Run in a zig-zag and don't stop. Go!

02:12.880 --> 02:14.800
Did you understand me? Stand up.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.640
Stand where I can see you.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.560
Where is she? Last chance!

02:28.280 --> 02:29.760
GRUNTING

02:32.800 --> 02:34.520
GUNSHOT

02:41.960 --> 02:44.800
Stop! Armed police! Put your weapon down now!

02:53.880 --> 02:55.720
Down on the ground!

03:00.640 --> 03:02.040
Stay where you are!

03:03.120 --> 03:04.520
Stop!

03:15.640 --> 03:19.000
# Do you want me on your mind?

03:19.000 --> 03:24.120
# Or do you want me to go on?

03:27.560 --> 03:33.840
# I might be yours, as sure as I can say

03:33.840 --> 03:38.160
# Be gone, be faraway

03:40.640 --> 03:44.840
# Oooh, oooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

03:48.640 --> 03:51.680
# Oooh, oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

03:51.680 --> 03:54.320
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

03:54.320 --> 03:57.920
# Mmm-mmm-mmm... #

04:02.480 --> 04:06.120
ROBERTSON: How's Sabi? Suspected concussion, dehydration.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.520
It's a miracle she stayed hidden for so long.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.440
What did the medics say?

04:10.440 --> 04:12.920
They're going to take her in now. I'll follow on later.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.800
Is DCI Longacre OK?

04:14.800 --> 04:16.600
Yes, she's fine, sir.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.840
Any concerns?

04:17.840 --> 04:18.920
No concerns.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.360
Let's get her home. Sure.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.360
No concerns?

04:25.360 --> 04:27.600
I'm not concerned.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.240
What about you?

04:29.240 --> 04:30.840
Sore ribs.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.920
Shall we just get you checked out, just in case?

04:36.280 --> 04:37.800
He's kicking.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.240
Is he?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.280
He was bleeding from his forehead.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.880
You should get a decent sample from that.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.080
You know, you should've waited for backup.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.680
SHE GROANS

04:58.080 --> 05:00.680
So should've you.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.280
Hmm

05:05.280 --> 05:08.360
Do you think we can go home now? You have to.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.760
Robertson pretty much insisted on it.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.280
Ma'am, just found this phone. Could be Chapman's.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.400
Lab. DNA and prints first.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.200
Er, Digital gets it second. Got it.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.280
And can you please get DI Longacre into a car and driven home?

05:21.280 --> 05:23.680
No, I can drive. That's my decision.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
Yes, ma'am.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.040
VELCRO RIPS

05:42.320 --> 05:44.200
Sabiha. DCI Silva.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.600
Amy.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.080
Hi. How are you feeling?

05:52.880 --> 05:54.560
If I could, I'd let you recover

05:54.560 --> 05:57.800
and not have you answer my questions, but we do have to talk.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.280
It really can't wait.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.200
Look, just do your best.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.160
Anything that you can tell me is going to help me

06:04.160 --> 06:06.160
catch the man who did this to you and your dad.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.960
And to you.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.720
Yeah, yeah.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.320
I want him caught.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.600
I, er, didn't even really see him.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.080
OK.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.440
I saw Dad get shot. I...

06:24.920 --> 06:26.800
I saw he was dead.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.200
And, er, then, I ran and hid.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.400
You must have been terrified.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.520
I didn't know what else to do,

06:38.520 --> 06:40.480
so I just stayed hidden.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.520
And then I heard your voices.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.080
You did really well.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.400
Did you have any idea that you and your dad might have been in danger?

06:50.400 --> 06:53.360
My dad didn't do anything wrong. He's a good person.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.880
Does that matter to you? What I think of him?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.800
Yes. You're worried about what people will think?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.840
OK, well...

07:02.720 --> 07:04.560
Why don't you talk to me about him?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.160
Sabiha, I know that hurts.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.440
I've lost people. It took me a long time to talk about it.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.760
But these next few hours, they're so important.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.720
Can you tell me about the last few weeks?

07:25.720 --> 07:28.880
So, you were staying on the base in Wudyan.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.720
And then you came back really suddenly. Why was that?

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
Um, I don't know, um...

07:37.200 --> 07:40.440
Dad went to a conference in Dubai for a few days and...

07:40.440 --> 07:43.960
..I mostly just stayed in and watched TV, and when he got back,

07:43.960 --> 07:47.080
he said that we had to come home for a hospital appointment.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.440
And he didn't go to that hospital appointment, did he? We know that.

07:50.440 --> 07:55.080
So, what did he tell you when he took you up to the cottage?

07:55.080 --> 07:56.200
Nothing.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.760
What did you tell your friends?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.160
I didn't talk to them.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.640
You didn't?

08:04.960 --> 08:06.760
See, I have a daughter,

08:06.760 --> 08:10.560
and she has her nose stuck in her phone all day.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.720
You... You didn't message anybody?

08:13.720 --> 08:15.320
We didn't take our phones.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.320
So, your dad asked you to leave your phone behind?

08:20.320 --> 08:23.040
I don't know anything else. I'm...I'm sorry. I...

08:23.040 --> 08:24.520
I just feel...

08:24.520 --> 08:26.920
Can you... Can you go? I don't...

08:26.920 --> 08:30.080
It's OK, it's OK. I just... You're doing really well.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.560
Can we talk about today?

08:35.560 --> 08:38.520
What happened in the few hours leading up to the attack?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.280
Um... Dad was gone for a bit.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.520
How long for?

08:48.520 --> 08:51.400
I don't know. An hour, maybe two.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.160
I don't know where he went.

08:53.160 --> 08:57.960
And he never said anything more about what you were doing there?

08:57.960 --> 09:01.280
He never tells me about work cos he can't.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.520
I'm going to show you something.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.000
I'm doing to show you some pictures.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.520
Have you ever seen anything that looks like this?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.640
No.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.080
Why?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.840
Do you know what that is? No.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.400
Did you see your dad store anything that might be around that size?

09:23.400 --> 09:25.520
Dad didn't do anything!

09:25.520 --> 09:28.200
He's been killed and you're talking about him like he's...

09:28.200 --> 09:31.040
I'm not accusing him of anything. Then what's happened?

09:31.040 --> 09:32.800
Why are you showing me that stuff?

09:35.800 --> 09:40.800
Your dad worked on an R-PAS weapons programme.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.320
And today, those drones were being tested in Scotland

09:44.320 --> 09:48.240
and someone used one of them to kill several people on the testing range.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.120
Your dad has been identified as the person

09:53.120 --> 09:55.000
who was controlling that R-PAS.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.800
No.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.040
Look, I'm keeping an open mind.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.920
I want to...I want to go back. I want to go back to Wudyan.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.000
I'm not sure that's possible. Can you stop me?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.160
I've got no-one here. My mum's family's there.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.600
I want...I want to go back! All right, OK.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.360
Let's leave it there for now.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.520
You try and get some rest.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.200
KNOCKS LIGHTLY

10:36.200 --> 10:37.440
Hey.

10:37.440 --> 10:38.840
Thank you.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.000
How are you feeling? Sore.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.600
I'll bet.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.160
How's Chapman's daughter?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.640
Exhausted.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.200
Grieving.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.040
I don't think she's telling me everything she knows.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.560
And she wants to go back to Wudyan.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.280
Can we stop her? I don't think so.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.480
Not unless we arrest her. We haven't got cause. Hmm.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.840
So, state of play?

10:59.840 --> 11:02.480
We've got half the force out looking for Chapman's killer.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.280
What about the gentleman we arrested at the Air Force range?

11:05.280 --> 11:08.000
Mr Zaman? He's not being very cooperative.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.720
We're just going over everything now.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.520
But, as yet, there's no link between him and Chapman.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.120
KNOCK AT DOOR

11:14.120 --> 11:17.320
Do you have a moment, sir? We've got something. Mm-hm.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.320
We've been looking into the GPS data that gave us Chapman's location.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.080
And this just came back from the R-PAS manufacturer.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.120
This line here is the latency signal.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.320
HE SIGHS

11:34.320 --> 11:35.760
Right.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.240
When you operate an R-PAS,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.280
the controller unit sends a signal up to the satellite

11:41.280 --> 11:44.720
and the satellite sends the signal back down to the R-PAS.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.080
Right, the time it takes between sending the signal

11:47.080 --> 11:49.800
and the R-PAS receiving it, that's the latency rate.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.760
These two were being controlled from the range at Dundair.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.320
These two were being flown from Wudyan.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.560
The latency rate is different between the two locations,

11:57.560 --> 12:01.280
because the data has got longer to travel.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.080
Now, when Chapman logs in

12:04.080 --> 12:06.560
and takes over the R-PAS that Dixon had been on,

12:06.560 --> 12:09.360
you'd expect the latency to stay the same,

12:09.360 --> 12:12.160
because Chapman is also operating from Scotland, right?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.920
It doesn't match.

12:13.920 --> 12:17.960
It matches the latency rate of the R-PAS being controlled from Wudyan.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.080
Yes, exactly.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.520
So, why does the GPS data put the console in Scotland?

12:22.520 --> 12:24.360
GPS is easy to spoof.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.800
The latency data,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.840
that's the thing you can't fake.

12:27.840 --> 12:31.080
So, turns out, we can definitely say that the R-PAS

12:31.080 --> 12:34.480
that committed the attack at Dundair was controlled from Wudyan?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.440
Yes, exactly.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.800
Chapman didn't do it.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.800
We have evidence that Anthony Chapman

12:46.800 --> 12:48.280
didn't pilot the rogue R-PAS.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.960
It wasn't piloted from Scotland.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.520
It was piloted from somewhere in Wudyan.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.040
Either from the base there, or nearby.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.200
That's impossible.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.320
We can share the data.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.560
The satellite operator's already verified it.

12:59.560 --> 13:03.320
So, can you explain why he lied to us about having cancer?

13:03.320 --> 13:04.600
Why he went into hiding?

13:04.600 --> 13:06.000
Not yet.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.600
We need to visit the base in Wudyan.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.640
Can you help us make the necessary arrangements?

13:15.080 --> 13:20.920
Look, we are effectively lodgers at Al-Shawka airbase.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.200
It's Wudyani territory.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.520
We provide them with services as per our agreement, that's all.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.360
We can't mandate them to give you access.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.400
They lost two of their own at Dundair.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.640
Surely they would want to support the investigation.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.200
Well, they'll want to do it themselves. They'd insist on that.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.560
I'm sure we can make the case. There are seven people dead.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.760
It's our duty to investigate

13:37.760 --> 13:39.680
and Al-Shawka base is part of my crime scene.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.680
We'll have to go through their formal channels.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.440
It could take weeks. Well, if we can't get the access

13:44.440 --> 13:47.200
we need straight away, then we can look at alternatives.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.120
It's just I don't really want to have to apply for a warrant

13:50.120 --> 13:52.280
to arrest the entire squadron.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.480
HE LAUGHS

13:53.480 --> 13:55.280
She's joking, isn't she?

13:55.280 --> 13:56.960
I don't believe she is, no.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.920
Is that legal, Sir Ian?

13:59.920 --> 14:04.360
Our relationship with Wudyan is quite fragile at the moment.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.720
I can't imagine the Foreign Office would disagree. Emma?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.600
I've been with the ambassador all morning.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.160
They're spooked by what happened at Dundair.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.640
Maybe this would be better handled by Intelligence.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.520
MI5 has strong links there, don't you?

14:16.520 --> 14:18.840
Seven murders on Scottish soil.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.920
This will be handled by the police.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.040
The men and women that died were colleagues.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.080
I spoke to some of their families this morning.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.840
If you think I'm being obstructive, then you misunderstand me.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.080
I'm saying that we have to be careful not to cause

14:31.080 --> 14:32.560
an international incident.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.680
One misstep and you'll find you can't fill your car with petrol.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.120
I drive an electric.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.200
Of course you do.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.280
Ian, I think perhaps you should share MI5's intelligence,

14:44.280 --> 14:47.600
on the understanding that it never leaves this room.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.040
We had some information from Wudyani Intelligence

14:51.040 --> 14:52.640
about Firas Zaman.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.800
This morning, the Wudyanis talked of a man named Mohammed Rajab.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.400
Now, he was already in prison there on terrorism charges.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.280
Mr Rajab confirmed his links to Mr Zaman and to Jabhat Al'huriya.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.480
He also confirmed the existence of a plot,

15:07.480 --> 15:11.920
er, whose aim was to disrupt the UK-Wudyani relationship.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.840
Mohammed Rajab. He's come up in our investigation.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.120
Really? How so?

15:17.120 --> 15:20.360
He's a doctor, isn't he? He wrote some prescriptions for Mr Zaman.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.120
And Mr Zaman couldn't explain why he had them.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.080
We need to see those. Of course.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.560
We think they might have been used as a way to pass coded messages.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.240
Well, we're...good at that.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.160
There's an address on the prescription.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.680
A Bahrat Wud.

15:33.680 --> 15:38.040
Does that location have any links to the Jabhat Al'huriya dissidents?

15:42.840 --> 15:45.880
We'll look into it. Will you keep me abreast? Of course.

15:47.200 --> 15:52.000
Marcus, I think co-operation is, is both possible and necessary.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.800
If political capital has to be spent, then, you know,

15:55.800 --> 15:57.480
now's the time to do it.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.760
We'll have to give them something.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.440
A minister expressing public support for the Wudyanis,

16:05.440 --> 16:09.000
something like that. Otherwise, it'll be...it'll be very hard.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.600
I'll see what I can do.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.000
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.880
Thank you.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.840
I'll book a flight tonight.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.080
Would your counterparts be able to get me

16:20.080 --> 16:21.800
an interview with Mohammed Rajab?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.920
One step at a time.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.080
Of course.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.800
It's only for a few days.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.040
I don't understand.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.080
I've been away for work before, it's been fine.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.240
They have the death penalty for lots of things there.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.400
Don't believe everything you read online, Pops.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.680
I'm taking a young girl back there with me.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.480
She's not much older than you.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.960
I have to get her settled.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.320
They put gay people in prison.

16:59.880 --> 17:04.440
I know, but I have a job to do and it's really important to me

17:04.440 --> 17:06.240
that I do that job well.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.480
And anyway, Kirsten's got to stay here,

17:10.480 --> 17:13.400
so it's not like I'm going to be kissing women... Stop!

17:28.960 --> 17:33.160
She thinks I'm going to be arrested for attending a wild lesbian orgy.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.360
Well, I mean, I do share that concern.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.080
What's the latest?

17:45.080 --> 17:49.080
Well, we're looking at Chapman for colluding with a dissident group.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.160
And then they kill him?

17:53.160 --> 17:56.600
Well, he helps them gain access to the R-PAS programme

17:56.600 --> 17:59.080
and they kill him to stop him talking.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.840
Or he gets cold feet and runs and they pursue.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.200
I don't know.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.640
I'm going to try and get access to one of their prisoners.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.520
You'll be careful, won't you?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.720
I'm going to be surrounded by people with guns.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.560
I'm going to be fine.

18:20.960 --> 18:25.440
You know, while I'm away, would you have another think about

18:25.440 --> 18:28.480
stepping back from front-line duties?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.520
No.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.960
But, erm, well, it's very kind of you to ask.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.520
I'm going to miss you.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.680
Miss you, too.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.720
Why are you looking at him?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.600
Just doing my homework.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.320
Do you know him? No.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.280
I mean, I know who he is, but I don't really know anyone there.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.920
They can't have kept you locked in your bedroom the whole time.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.240
Yeah, they let me go on all the missions.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.800
I flew the helicopter.

19:35.480 --> 19:36.960
What about your dad?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.520
Did he have friends there or was it all just work?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.560
Do you ever just talk to people?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.280
Yeah!

19:45.280 --> 19:46.840
No, you don't.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.720
OK.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.600
What do you want to talk about?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.080
Nothing.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.160
But at least I know how.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.560
I've been at five different international schools

19:58.560 --> 20:01.840
since I was six. You learn how to talk. Six?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.000
That's young.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.640
My mum died.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.320
Do you like school?

20:12.200 --> 20:14.680
I'm...going to try and get some sleep now.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.920
Thanks for the chat. It was great.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.840
Is there anything you want to ask me?

20:24.160 --> 20:27.160
Do you think someone on that base helped kill my dad?

20:27.160 --> 20:30.440
Is that why you're going there? I don't know.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.160
You'll love Wudyan.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.760
Nobody tells the truth there either.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.920
GLASS TINKLES

20:50.760 --> 20:52.000
Howdy, pard'ner.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.160
Can I help you?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.720
Yeah, that's the, er, general idea.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.240
I'll help you as well.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.120
We're going to be working together.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.800
What, you've been assigned to...?

21:05.800 --> 21:08.360
WE'VE been assigned to each other.

21:08.360 --> 21:12.240
It's funny, I didn't realise you guys even did counterterrorism.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.480
I just assumed they'd bring in the Met.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.600
Oh, no need for that now that you're here.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.360
Touche.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.440
So, I've been er, going over the prescriptions

21:21.440 --> 21:23.360
you found in Mr Zaman's flat.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.760
Might have something interesting for you.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.800
21, 5, 23.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.440
The 21st of May. Yup.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.640
That's the date of the attack. Exactly.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.880
But if you look at the next one...

21:34.880 --> 21:36.920
It's not just the date of this test.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.720
They correspond with every major test 109 Squadron did

21:39.720 --> 21:41.200
in the last six months.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.600
So, someone on the base is passing information to a terrorist group?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.080
Looks that way, yeah.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.600
So, where's good for lunch?

21:55.320 --> 21:57.200
INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
You don't need that any more, by the way.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.280
Well, er, they told me to wear it.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.760
The King relaxed the rules.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.080
It's up to you now.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.480
OK.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.880
Just a shame that everyone

22:07.880 --> 22:10.080
who fought for those rights is still in prison.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.320
MAN: Miss Silva and Miss Chapman?

22:23.320 --> 22:24.560
Yes.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.080
Would you follow me, please?

22:36.080 --> 22:38.600
Is there anything in particular that you're looking for?

22:38.600 --> 22:41.200
What would he be looking for, hmm?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.600
I don't know, it's, we went through Security like everyone else.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.240
I'm just trying to be helpful.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.240
That's my moisturiser.

22:58.320 --> 22:59.480
OVER RADIO: ..Amy Silva.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.480
Afternoon.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.280
I believe you have some people that belong to me.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.880
TRAFFIC BUSTLE, CHATTER

23:16.440 --> 23:19.560
Sorry you got held up. I should have seen that coming.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.240
Yeah, felt like we were settling in for a long day.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.760
The regime love to remind us who's in charge.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.320
Are you in charge now?

23:57.320 --> 23:59.040
Stepping up in the role.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.760
Dad never picked people up from the airport.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.680
That's not true.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.960
He always collected you, didn't he?

24:18.320 --> 24:21.480
What's going on? They're tightening up security.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.560
It's full checks on every vehicle now.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.720
Hi. This is Colonel Bilali. He's Base Commander here at Al-Shawka.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.800
It would be helpful to discuss your case, once you've settled in. Sure.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.760
Sir, if I can suggest waiting until today's operation is finished.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.680
We could arrange something for tomorrow. Today would be better.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.360
My aide will make arrangements.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.800
Oh, Sabiha.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.520
I don't know what to say.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.040
I'm sorry.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.760
Take Sabi's bag. Report back in 20 minutes. Yes, ma'am.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.240
I'll need to check out

25:28.240 --> 25:31.000
Wing Commander Chapman's quarters before I... Already did it.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.600
Full search. Nothing found.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.800
If you'd like to come with me, I'll get you briefed.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.400
I'm using Wing Commander Chapman's office for the moment.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.040
Have a seat.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.400
DOOR CLOSES

25:54.400 --> 25:57.040
You need to send Sabi back to the UK.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.600
Colonel Bilali should never have allowed it.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.440
It's not just that she's an unaccompanied minor on an airbase,

26:02.440 --> 26:03.920
though that...that is a problem,

26:03.920 --> 26:05.600
she's not going to do well here.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.000
She's angry and she's grieving.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.920
She'll act out and this is not a country

26:08.920 --> 26:11.440
where teenage girls get away with bad behaviour.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.280
Legally she's an adult, so, really, that's up to her.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.800
But I'll... I'll do what I can.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.880
Thank you.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.320
Now, what do you need from us?

26:19.320 --> 26:21.520
Can we schedule the pilots' interviews?

26:21.520 --> 26:23.880
I need to speak to Flight Lieutenant Callum Barker

26:23.880 --> 26:25.080
and Captain Sam Kader.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.040
I thought Wing Commander Chapman had been found responsible.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.800
No, that's not the case.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.320
The GPS readings were faked.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.800
Chapman could have been framed.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.720
We found evidence that a group called Jabhat Al'huriya have

26:35.720 --> 26:38.440
been receiving information about your weapons programme.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.760
It's likely to have come from here.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.720
I haven't been briefed about that.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.760
Well, I imagine you will be.

26:50.760 --> 26:54.720
So, how do you go about accusing people of being traitors,

26:54.720 --> 26:56.480
in a way that improves morale?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.000
I'm sensitive to the issues.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.240
I've had experience working with the military before.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
Yes, I heard. A Vanguard-class submarine.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.720
The great unwashed.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.680
Yeah, that's right.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.720
This is different.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.200
We're in plain sight.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.960
I can make Barker available to you.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.240
But Kader isn't Air Force, so it's more complicated.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.080
Kader's part of the squadron? It's a joint venture.

27:21.080 --> 27:25.120
UK, Wudyan, and the developer, Alban-X.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.960
You need to speak to Colonel Bilali about Kader,

27:27.960 --> 27:29.640
as he's a Wudyani national.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.760
Um, and the main guy at Alban-X to speak to would be...?

27:32.760 --> 27:35.120
Wes Harper, Chief Software Engineer.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.320
He was on the call with us.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.280
But I'm not his commander.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.920
We're all basically sub-contractors here.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.000
That's the truth of it. For a fee?

27:45.880 --> 27:48.040
Yes, but it's not about the money.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.680
It's about making ourselves essential.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.960
British arms delivered with the support of the British Air Force.

27:53.960 --> 27:57.160
The Wudyani Air Force would grind to a halt if we weren't here,

27:57.160 --> 28:00.000
so, believe me, if you jeopardise these operations,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.720
your visa will be revoked in a heartbeat.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.880
Well, I'll try not to cause a diplomatic incident.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.720
I need to speak to you, as well. Excuse me?

28:08.720 --> 28:11.280
Just to clarify your movements around the time of the attack.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.920
Well, you have my report.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.120
If it's an alibi you're after,

28:16.120 --> 28:19.720
then you've half the squadron to pick from.

28:20.840 --> 28:24.280
Is there anything else? If anything comes up about Jabhat Al'huriya...

28:24.280 --> 28:26.000
Yes, I'll flag it. I understand.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.360
Flight Lieutenant Callum Barker, then. Shall we say 6pm?

28:30.360 --> 28:33.200
We were on a night mission till 6am, so most of the pilots have

28:33.200 --> 28:36.040
got their heads down. I'll have you shown to your quarters.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.800
I'll let you know when they're available.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.440
I've asked them to find you a room with a decent view.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.760
We found the owner of the van used by the shooter.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.280
He took the plates off,

28:52.280 --> 28:55.000
but it'd already been reported stolen by the time he dumped it.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.640
Arlene Royce, 26.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.440
She's a cleaner, no record or anything like that.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.080
She got back from visiting her parents in Fort William,

29:03.080 --> 29:05.720
noticed the van was gone, called it in straight away.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.760
This is the rifle he used.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.120
This is a Parker-Hale.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.560
It's an old model.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.960
Magazine holds five rounds.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.200
The good news is the owner had the barrel marked-up with SmartWater.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.160
So, we know exactly where it came from.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.640
The Lochduin estate.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.760
Anyone want to guess where Arlene cleans?

29:23.760 --> 29:25.920
Lochduin estate? Bingo.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.480
Longacre, I think this is one for you.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.680
And Mr Ramsay, too, of course.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.880
In most parts of the world, if you need somebody shot,

29:39.880 --> 29:42.240
it's better to hire a local to do the job.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.320
Why risk an operative when you can pay some random idiot five grand?

29:45.320 --> 29:48.080
Now, the downside for us is, when you catch them,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.600
they don't know anything.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.920
Someone paid them to do it. Dead end.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.840
Is that what you think this guy is?

29:53.840 --> 29:56.320
A five-grand job organised on the dark web?

29:56.320 --> 29:57.800
It's too early to say.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.040
That's gold dust, that.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.240
HE SCOFFS

30:03.240 --> 30:06.920
Look, all I'm saying is, if he kills Sabiha with his second shot,

30:06.920 --> 30:09.080
he's got plenty of time to get rid of the gun,

30:09.080 --> 30:10.520
drive off and ditch the van.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.600
On the other hand, he picked a limited-magazine rifle,

30:13.600 --> 30:16.200
his second shot misses and he didn't have a backup plan.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.600
It's a B-minus grade from me.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.160
What about you?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.320
Well, he tried to kill me and Amy,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.920
so I'm not quite ready to turn him into a Top Trump card.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.080
Hey, is there somewhere I can make a drink? Yeah, through there.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.320
SHE EXHALES, WATER SPLASHES

31:21.880 --> 31:26.240
Captain Sam Kader? DCI Amy Silva.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.560
Sorry, I'm due inside.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.040
We're about to start an operation.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.720
I take it you weren't part of the mission last night?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.360
What mission?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.680
Oh, my mistake.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.720
I thought the squadron worked till 6am?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.760
Obviously not.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.000
Please.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.240
Looks like we're about to go in.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.280
MILLINGTON, ON RADIO: Troops approaching location.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.160
November lead, this is Operations.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.200
Alpha One to Control. Confirm. Approaching Bahrat Wud.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.600
What the hell are you doing? You told me the pilots were asleep.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.240
I had to wake them up.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.360
That happened pretty quickly.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.520
Are you running an operation against Jabhat Al'huriya?

32:27.520 --> 32:29.640
You said you'd let me know if you had any engagement

32:29.640 --> 32:32.200
with the dissidents. This is relevant to my investigation.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.880
We're providing operational support to a Wudyani mission

32:34.880 --> 32:38.200
to apprehend Wudyani citizens. I'll need access to anyone they arrest.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.240
I'm sorry, but it's not my operation

32:40.240 --> 32:42.880
and it's not my place to disclose Wudyani actions.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.520
Are you in Bahrat Wud?

32:44.520 --> 32:45.680
I can't disclose that.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.160
There's no need. I've got eyes.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.280
This house was identified by my investigation.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.880
Does Intelligence think it's being used by Jabhat Al'huriya?

32:52.880 --> 32:55.400
For the last time and with due respect,

32:55.400 --> 32:57.600
it is not my place to brief you on Wudyani operations.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.520
I have to focus on the mission now. You're welcome to stay and observe.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.160
We've nothing to hide. But if you keep interrupting me,

33:03.160 --> 33:05.000
I'll have you escorted back to your room.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.840

33:22.360 --> 33:26.160
Ma'am, eyes on all exits. No vehicles at the location.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.160
November lead, this is Operations.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.200
Surrounding roads clear, no civilians.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.640
Copy that, Control. Approaching the vehicle.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.280
We're going in.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.320
Ma'am, they've entered the property.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.800
Ground team is inside.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.960
Confirmed. We see it.

This is Delta 2-1. Movement at the rear of the property.

34:04.160 --> 34:07.480
Where? Possible enemy combatant. No clear visual.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.760
How did we miss this? I said, "Eyes on all exits."

34:10.760 --> 34:13.080
November lead, report. RADIO: Yes, ma'am.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.760

Toyota Hilux, registration plate, 3-7-3-7-call-1-2-2.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.040
They're moving?

34:34.040 --> 34:35.280
Where? Come on!

34:35.280 --> 34:37.040
November lead, this is Operations.

34:37.040 --> 34:40.160
Two male combatants escaping the scene in a domestic vehicle.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.200
Driving at approximately 50mph, on the eastbound road.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.440
Confirmed. Follow the vehicle, Delta 2-1.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.320
Roger. Tracking the vehicle. We need you to take them out.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.520
Sir, you know we're not permitted to do that. This is your error.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.760
With respect, sir, we can only act on the intelligence we're given.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.920
No eyes on combat vehicle.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.600
Lost visual on target.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.800
And they're gone.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.760
Excellent work, Squadron Leader.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.000
Flight Lieutenant Barker, how did you miss this? Clear sightlines!

35:21.000 --> 35:24.240
Those were your orders! If you can't see something, say something!

35:24.240 --> 35:25.800
Yes, ma'am.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.680
Hodges, take Mission Control. Barker, you're relieved.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.400
And take the DCI with you.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.200
CHAIR SCRAPES

35:50.400 --> 35:52.280
It's a two-can rule.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.760
The country's dry.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.560
But they're OK with that?

35:55.560 --> 35:56.920
Don't ask, don't tell.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.680
Er...? Amy.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.840
Amy.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.400
You couldn't bring Sam in here.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.240
We'd corrupt him with our Western values.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.960
Is getting pissed a value?

36:07.960 --> 36:09.760
It is where I'm from.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.320
Fire away, then.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.120
So, you were one of the two pilots that were based here

36:22.120 --> 36:25.040
during the weapons test in Scotland? Yes, ma'am.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.240
Did anything give you cause for concern before the test?

36:28.240 --> 36:30.440
I mean, the Wing Commander took off.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.320
He was supposed to be running things.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.880
But, I mean, "cause for concern". No.

36:34.880 --> 36:38.800
So, you were on your own in a cabin during the whole of the test? Yeah.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.000
No witnesses if that's what you're saying.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.280
No.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.560
I put everything in a written statement.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.400
Which I have here.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.920
So, at the end of the weapons test,

36:48.920 --> 36:51.720
you were ordered to leave all your equipment inside the cabin,

36:51.720 --> 36:53.320
is that right? That's standard.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.160
Wes, the Alban-X guy, comes in, packs it up.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.880
They don't like us handling their kit.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.680
And then I went straight to the debrief.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.640
And you and Captain Kader left your respective cabins at the same time?

37:02.640 --> 37:04.400
Sam went to the debrief.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.560
I talked with Wes about what happened.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.960
And the debrief was with...?

37:07.960 --> 37:09.800
The Squadron Leader.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.960
Eliza. She's a charmer, isn't she?

37:14.200 --> 37:19.160
So, just for clarity, all of your equipment was left in the cabin?

37:19.160 --> 37:20.880
What are you getting at?

37:20.880 --> 37:23.880
You need training to operate these R-PAS, right?

37:23.880 --> 37:26.640
And there's only a handful of people who have had that training

37:26.640 --> 37:29.000
and all of those people are here. Except for Chapman.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.960
Yeah. Look at what happened.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.480
The R-PAS sprayed fire, no targeting, barely any manoeuvring.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.200
If someone had been properly trained,

37:36.200 --> 37:39.120
they could have taken out that observation platform first try.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.600
I reckon they'd read the manual, more than that...

37:47.400 --> 37:49.720
Our boss has been killed. The unit looks like shit.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.760
People are talking about the whole programme getting shut down.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.600
Why would we do that to ourselves?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.520
If you want a list of people that want to attack

37:56.520 --> 37:58.720
the British Air Force or Wudyan, I can write you one.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.520
But there's no-one here that'd be on that list! I guarantee you!

38:01.520 --> 38:04.560
Were there any witnesses to you and Captain Kader leaving your cabins?

38:04.560 --> 38:06.560
Jesus, you're...you're serious.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.640
Wes, like I said.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.280
We done?

38:22.400 --> 38:24.080
You all right?

38:24.080 --> 38:25.680
I need to talk to you.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.520
Sorry, can it wait? I've had a very long day.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.720
I know we're not supposed to talk.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.720
But you have to tell me what happened.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.800
Sabs, even if I knew what was going on, I probably couldn't tell you.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.480
Shut up! Stop it. They killed my dad. They tried to kill me!

38:38.480 --> 38:41.760
I'm sorry. I really am. I just... I can't help you with anything.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.680
Was any of what you told me true?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.240
What are you talking about?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.080
Maybe try and get some rest? It's what I'm going to do.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.120
MEN SHOUT NEARBY

39:11.480 --> 39:13.240
All right, this is the armoury.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.680
That's a fancier door than I've seen here.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.120
Well, when you've got ten years of IP in a shed,

39:21.120 --> 39:22.760
you make sure it locks.

39:44.560 --> 39:48.080
Did you see Flight Lieutenant Barker and Captain Kader after the test?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.480
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.960
So, where did you put the pilot's consoles after they were used?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.320
Over here.

39:56.440 --> 39:57.640
Voila!

39:58.800 --> 40:00.800
There's three of them?

40:00.800 --> 40:02.320
Two for the test, one spare.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
The other two are still in Scotland.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.000
Cos you guys confiscated those.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.800
Thank you for that, by the way.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.200
Are there any others? Functional ones? No.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.760
So, the spare one was in here

40:11.760 --> 40:14.200
when you were setting up for the test? Yeah.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.400
And then when you returned the kit...? It was still here.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.120
I would have noticed if it wasn't.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.640
What... What are you asking me here?

40:20.640 --> 40:23.440
I'm just trying to work out how someone took control of the R-PAS.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.600
Put those on. They would have had to have had a console, right?

40:26.600 --> 40:27.800
Uh-huh.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.600
So, which one's the spare?

40:29.600 --> 40:31.200
Orange tab.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.400
Can you open up that flight case for me?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.480
You know my fingerprints are all over everything in here, right?

40:40.560 --> 40:41.880
OK.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.720
What is it?

40:44.720 --> 40:46.480
Er, it's light.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.800
What the hell? So, when you say you saw it in here...?

40:58.800 --> 41:01.400
I saw the case, I didn't look inside it. Why would I do that?

41:01.400 --> 41:04.000
You didn't think to check it after everything that happened?

41:04.000 --> 41:05.440
You ordered us not to come in here.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.360
This is the first time I got in here since the call.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.560
So, when's the last time you saw the ACTUAL console?

41:11.560 --> 41:13.680
I...I...I don't know.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.720
Three or four days before I sent the kit to Scotland?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.440
Shit, er...

41:21.040 --> 41:22.840
Er, there's a camera.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.520
The little black dome.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.280
Right, I'm going to check the tapes.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.280
This is... You need to check industrial sabotage.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.200
There's, like, ten global competitors who...

41:32.200 --> 41:33.560
KEYS CLACK

41:33.560 --> 41:35.800
..want to screw us in this market.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.120
OK, which date do I check? Day of the test? No.

41:41.120 --> 41:45.560
Start with the day you saw the actual console. OK.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.640
So, that's obviously me.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.320
Er, I was in here for, like, five minutes. Keep going.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.240
Stop there.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.760
There's nothing there.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.760
Go back to 2100 hours.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.960
What am I meant to...? Slow down.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.320
Just look at the time code as you go.

42:08.640 --> 42:09.920
Oh, shit! There's, like...

42:09.920 --> 42:13.720
13 minutes missing. Can you tell who erased this footage?

42:13.720 --> 42:15.720
Erm, yeah, yeah, er...

42:15.720 --> 42:17.640
There should be a log.

42:17.640 --> 42:18.920
This hasn't come up before.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.040
Yeah.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.240
Wing Commander Chapman.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.560
He erased the tape. So Chapman stole the kit?

42:26.560 --> 42:28.480
No. Someone else did.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.680
Look at the date.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.200
He was in Dubai on the 18th.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.920
He came back here the next day.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.480
That's when he erased the footage.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.680
About an hour after he got back to base.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.200
And...then he flew home.

42:40.760 --> 42:42.840
Booth, where are we on the flight data?

42:42.840 --> 42:45.320
Squadron Leader, I need to talk to you.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.040
Well, can't it wait? No.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.880
So, it's not just Wing Commander Chapman?

42:56.880 --> 42:58.720
It's him and...?

42:59.720 --> 43:03.040
And what? Another member of my team?

43:03.040 --> 43:05.400
The console was stolen while Chapman was off the base.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.840
So, at the very least he was working with someone.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.160
He covered up for them. No, I can't believe it.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.240
He'd know we'd discover the theft.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.440
He'd know we'd find out what he'd done with the CCT...

43:19.320 --> 43:22.120
He wasn't coming back, was he?

43:22.120 --> 43:24.200
Probably not.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.760
But if there is someone else he was working with...

43:26.760 --> 43:28.240
Then they're still here.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.960
So, I have to assume that someone on my team is a traitor?

43:30.960 --> 43:33.600
Collaborating with Mohammed Rajab, yes. No.

43:33.600 --> 43:37.280
There's definitely someone on this base working with Jabhat Al'huriya.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.960
How long have you worked at the Lochduin estate?

43:42.960 --> 43:44.240
Five years.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.520
That's depressing.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.920
I mean, they're really nice, but...

43:47.920 --> 43:50.240
Any relationships with the guys there?

43:50.240 --> 43:53.000
As in...a boyfriend? Hmm.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.680
Why? Well, I mean, the van didn't look broken into.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.600
So, I wondered if maybe you kept the keys...

43:59.600 --> 44:01.920
Under the seat. Yeah.

44:01.920 --> 44:05.360
And any guy I've gone out with would know that.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.480
OK.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.840
So, I've only been out with a couple of the guys from work.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.880
There was Sean, but he moved to Spain.

44:12.880 --> 44:15.920
The other guy was Ross. That was last year.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.120
And did Ross work full-time at the estate?

44:18.120 --> 44:21.280
Started working the shoots, then did a bit of everything.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.520
In loads of ways, he was a good guy,

44:23.520 --> 44:26.400
but if he thought someone was out for him, he'd go off.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.120
He had a row with someone. Didn't come back.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.960
Was he ex-military?

44:30.960 --> 44:32.280
Yeah.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.480
How do you know? He'd been shot and everything.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.200
Can we get some details about Ross? Everything that you've got.

44:40.200 --> 44:43.640
Is he in trouble? Did Ross steal my van?!

44:43.640 --> 44:45.040
Can you tell us where he lives?

44:48.720 --> 44:50.320
DCI Silva.

44:52.040 --> 44:54.160
Thank you for making the time. Of course.

44:54.160 --> 44:57.280
Let's walk. The perimeter is popular as a running track.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.760
We've had to stop that.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.280
Why's that?

45:00.280 --> 45:01.720
It's not especially secure.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.800
An easy shot for somebody.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.960
And the security picture seems to be evolving.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.520
Are you sure a dissident group's behind all of this?

45:08.520 --> 45:12.520
You mean Dundair? An attack on my soldiers and yours?

45:12.520 --> 45:15.360
If I was to place a bet, I'd suggest Jabhat Al'huriya

45:15.360 --> 45:18.160
are in league with dissidents across the border.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.680
Right, and that's the country...?

45:19.680 --> 45:22.000
We're supporting our neighbours.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.560
Er, the government is under siege from relentless dissident attacks.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.480
We've been drawn in.

45:27.480 --> 45:30.720
Defensively. Is the base involved in that?

45:30.720 --> 45:33.120
We conduct operations, yes.

45:33.120 --> 45:36.440
Like the one today? I'd like to look into that.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.920
You could be enormously helpful.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.240
How?

45:42.280 --> 45:45.800
What led you to raid that location today?

45:48.040 --> 45:49.280
Your intelligence.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.520
Mm, so, look, there's, there's a prisoner here

45:53.520 --> 45:57.200
who I believe has links to Jabhat Al'huriya.

45:57.200 --> 46:01.320
Dr Mohammed Rajab? I know it was his address you were raiding.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.000
If you could arrange for me to interview him?

46:04.000 --> 46:05.920
I'll do my best to help.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.880
I'd like to see Anthony cleared of any wrongdoing.

46:12.200 --> 46:16.680
Council have confirmed this is Ross Sutherland's last known address.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.720
I have to say, if he comes back here, he's an idiot.

46:19.720 --> 46:22.560
He doesn't know we've identified him.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.200
He stole his ex-girlfriend's van.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.400
He got his gun from the place he worked.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.760
I'd say he's a creature of habit.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.600
It's worth a shot.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.320
THUMPING

46:42.160 --> 46:44.920
HE RATTLES DOOR

46:44.920 --> 46:46.680
BANGING

46:49.320 --> 46:50.680
Ramsay.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.200
This one's already open.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.400
Right.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.400
CLUNKING

47:32.480 --> 47:34.080
What...? What are you doing?

47:34.080 --> 47:35.800
There's another way in.

47:35.800 --> 47:37.400
Just not through the front door.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.480
Are you coming?

48:05.680 --> 48:07.960
Not a fan of heights?

48:07.960 --> 48:10.000
Yeah, not so much.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.240
Right, let's check this over.

48:12.240 --> 48:15.080
Don't touch anything. Have you done this before?

48:15.080 --> 48:17.320
All right, I'm not going to mess up your scene.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.520
LOCK CLICKS

49:03.720 --> 49:05.080
OK.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.640
This because of what happened today?

49:10.640 --> 49:13.360
The mission goes wrong and this is what happens?

49:13.360 --> 49:15.240
I had no idea.

49:15.240 --> 49:18.120
This is not a common occurrence.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.040
But no prison is immune from this sort of thing.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.760
So, what did they say happened?

49:24.040 --> 49:25.320
A fight.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.840
A brutal one.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.320
These look like electric shock injuries.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.920
He's been tortured.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.560
They look like burns to me.

49:35.560 --> 49:38.080
No. These are contact points.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.680
Excuse me.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.200
DOOR CLOSES

49:50.680 --> 49:53.280
HE BREATHES SHAKILY

49:55.800 --> 49:57.320
Do you want to write?

49:58.520 --> 50:00.760
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

50:14.560 --> 50:16.400
There is nothing more we can achieve here.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.520
Well, can I speak to the prison governor?

50:18.520 --> 50:20.000
I'm afraid not.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.600
That was the...

50:22.640 --> 50:25.360
It has been decided that this meeting was inappropriate.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.440
It could jeopardise him from receiving a fair trial.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.320
So, please...?

50:31.560 --> 50:33.320
If you don't mind.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.520
Toothbrush is still wet.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.640
He's been here in the last 24 hours.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.160
So be discreet.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.320
No marked cars, no uniforms,

51:09.320 --> 51:12.560
and put observations on all approaches.

51:12.560 --> 51:13.720
Assume he's armed.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.280
Forensics will be happy.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.400
Got toothbrush and a razor right there.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.960
You can tell he's ex-military.

51:19.960 --> 51:22.880
How's that? He's squatting, but he still made the bed.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.720
Would you like to do the honours?

51:26.720 --> 51:28.480
Where'd you find this?

51:28.480 --> 51:30.080
Under his T-shirts.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.960
Same deal as everything else.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.800
This guy's not expecting to be found. Hmm.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.520
Sabi was a target as well.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.440
I thought she was collateral.

52:00.840 --> 52:02.680
This is DI Kirsten Longacre.

52:02.680 --> 52:05.040
You guys were looking at DNA extraction from a phone

52:05.040 --> 52:08.160
we recovered at the Anthony Chapman murder scene. That's right.

52:08.160 --> 52:11.840
Can I get your preliminaries? Soon as you can, please.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.320
Thank you.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.440
MESSAGE CHIMES

52:15.440 --> 52:16.920
Backup are here.

52:16.920 --> 52:19.360
They need someone to meet them out front.

52:21.160 --> 52:22.400
Do you want me to go?

52:22.400 --> 52:25.360
No. No, no. No, no, no. I've got this.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.600
MOBILE RINGS

52:48.600 --> 52:49.840
Excuse me.

52:52.520 --> 52:54.080
Hey.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.600
Can you talk?

52:55.600 --> 52:58.080
Er, no, not really.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.520
You can though.

52:59.520 --> 53:01.960
Remember the phone we recovered at the cottage?

53:01.960 --> 53:03.840
It's not Chapman's.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.120
It's Sabi's.

53:05.120 --> 53:07.840
She told you she didn't have a phone with her, didn't she?

53:10.320 --> 53:11.800
Are you there?

53:11.800 --> 53:14.080
Yeah, just, um, give me a minute.

53:19.200 --> 53:23.040
Thank you for your help. It's much appreciated.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.080
You should try to complete your work here quickly.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.680
Have a good evening.

53:33.800 --> 53:36.000
OK, I can talk.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.440
Look, if you're Chapman, who do you protect, at any cost?

53:39.440 --> 53:41.680
Your daughter. Right.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.800
So, Chapman went to Dubai on the 18th.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.640
So, if he left his warehouse pass behind, she could have used it.

53:46.640 --> 53:50.080
He finds out, deletes the footage, gets her out of the country.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.640
Where's Sabi now?

53:51.640 --> 53:53.000
I don't know.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.760
I need to find her.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.600
SHE SIGHS

54:30.160 --> 54:32.720
My name's Kirsten. I'm a police detective.

54:32.720 --> 54:35.120
We received a call about this property.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.320
I heard you talking.

54:38.760 --> 54:41.600
OK. So, you know why I'm here, then?

54:42.640 --> 54:44.040
How'd you find me?

54:45.440 --> 54:46.720
Stand still!

54:48.040 --> 54:50.400
If you move, if you call out,

54:50.400 --> 54:52.600
if you touch your phone...

54:54.120 --> 54:55.440
..I'll break your neck.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.280
We can help you.

54:58.280 --> 55:00.920
If you talk to us, we can help you.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.760
Do you know my name?

55:02.760 --> 55:04.680
Ross Sutherland.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.920
You're a war veteran, right?

55:06.920 --> 55:08.640
I'm just doing my job.

55:10.160 --> 55:12.160
My colleague's coming back.

55:12.160 --> 55:13.640
I know.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.920
So, I wouldnae do anything rash.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.120
Lie down on your front.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.720
No.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.040
Do what I tell you.

55:24.040 --> 55:26.200
No, I can't, I cannae...

55:26.200 --> 55:29.960
I'm pregnant! I also have a daughter at home... Shut up!

55:31.080 --> 55:32.640
If you come and talk with me,

55:32.640 --> 55:34.920
that would be the best thing for you.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.320
You know why I'm here, don't you?

55:37.320 --> 55:39.240
Because of Anthony Chapman.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.400
Someone hired you to kill him

55:41.400 --> 55:43.840
and now they've left you here to fend for yourself.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.120
You don't owe that person anything.

55:47.040 --> 55:50.840
Someone's trying to frame Chapman for a crime. Are you a part of that?

55:50.840 --> 55:52.840
That's bollocks. No, it's true.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.920
Why? What did they tell you?

55:57.960 --> 56:00.480
Did they say he was a terrorist? Cos if they told you that,

56:00.480 --> 56:03.760
they've been lying to you... Shut your mouth!

56:14.280 --> 56:16.120
It's not my job to kill you.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.720
SCUFFLING

56:47.520 --> 56:48.960
HE GROANS

56:48.960 --> 56:50.000
Woo!

56:52.120 --> 56:53.440
That's not legal.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.800
I didn't hear a whistle.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.720
I'll bring one next time.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.000
What are you doing, Sabi?

57:26.600 --> 57:28.360
I'll take you back to the main building.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.800
SLICING

57:31.480 --> 57:33.640
I've got her! Just drop it!

57:33.640 --> 57:35.680
Let me go! Drop it!
