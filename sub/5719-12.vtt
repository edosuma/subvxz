WEBVTT

00:00.317 --> 00:01.728
Previuosly on "Heartland"...

00:05.582 --> 00:08.851
- Ow! It really hurts!
- You're gonna be okay.

00:08.885 --> 00:12.087
There you are,
you slippery sucker!

00:15.725 --> 00:17.460
When we were in Vancouver
at Dad's condo,

00:17.494 --> 00:20.095
we met his new girlfriend.

00:20.129 --> 00:23.030
You know she's a younger,
prettier, more stylish me.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.333
She's Lou 2.0.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.034
You need to move on, Lou.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.571
So what, you think I should
start dating again?

00:29.605 --> 00:30.939
Actually, yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.588 --> 00:48.589
I'm still mad at you.

01:33.431 --> 01:37.401
Wow! It's like she never
even broke her ankle.

01:45.576 --> 01:48.210
She's coming along, huh.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.882
Not too bad, huh?

01:52.917 --> 01:55.184
You don't see that everyday,
a female bronc rider.

01:55.218 --> 01:57.286
Especially one that rides
like you. Great job.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.756
You know what, I think it's
time to find you a sponsor.

01:59.790 --> 02:02.291
Okay.

02:02.325 --> 02:04.760
I mean, I know I've done all
right in a couple of rodeos,

02:04.794 --> 02:06.662
but seriously?

02:06.696 --> 02:08.030
C'mon, Tim.

02:08.064 --> 02:10.264
I haven't even been repped
since Longview beef jerky.

02:10.299 --> 02:12.233
I don't think you can
consider someone who pays you

02:12.268 --> 02:14.770
in dehydrated beef a sponsor.

02:14.804 --> 02:16.504
Anyway I got somebody in mind.

02:16.539 --> 02:17.906
It's a guy I used to rodeo with.

02:17.941 --> 02:19.474
His name is Turner Keith.

02:19.508 --> 02:21.508
And he owns Tracker
Western Wear.

02:21.543 --> 02:23.911
Really? Does he know who I am?

02:23.946 --> 02:26.213
No. But I've invited him
to come see you after practice.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.648
So we're gonna show him
what you got.

02:27.683 --> 02:29.050
What do you think?

02:29.084 --> 02:31.586
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:34.489 --> 02:36.023
I think this is realistic.

02:36.058 --> 02:37.891
Really, Lou.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.759
Hey!

02:39.794 --> 02:42.596
- Where's Jack?
- He's out with the herd, why?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.130
I've been calling him
all morning,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.132
and he's not answering
his phone.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.533
It's driving me crazy.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.365
Well, is everything all right?

02:48.418 --> 02:51.135
Yeah. We're just, we're trying to book
a ranch in Arizona for the winter,

02:51.162 --> 02:53.039
and we're about to miss out
on a killer deal.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.745
- Ooh, a wish list?
- Yeah. - What's that for?

02:56.785 --> 02:59.645
Oh, this is just everything that Lou
could ever possibly want in a guy

02:59.679 --> 03:01.346
she might potentially date.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.715
That's quite a start.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.182
It's just some criteria
to help me think through

03:04.217 --> 03:06.051
what I'm looking for.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.486
Let's see what we got here.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.455
28 to 35 years old,
Tall, 5'10 to 6'1.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.083
Obviously.

03:12.162 --> 03:16.094
Good looking, family focused,
likes kids, fit...

03:16.228 --> 03:21.032
Come on, Lou, like really if anyone
is gonna stack up to all of this.

03:21.066 --> 03:23.067
Can't wait till you find
Mr. Perfect?

03:23.102 --> 03:25.269
Ah, what about online...

03:25.303 --> 03:28.972
Lisa, what is it with you
and internet dating?

03:29.007 --> 03:30.841
You're the one who pushed me
to email Peter

03:30.875 --> 03:32.242
before I even met him.

03:32.276 --> 03:34.577
Yes, and that worked,
didn't it? You married him.

03:34.612 --> 03:36.046
That's not the point.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.481
Well, you know what, sites
have come a long way since then.

03:38.516 --> 03:40.583
I've had a number of friends
have real success.

03:40.636 --> 03:41.137
Really?

03:41.218 --> 03:44.387
More than just wish list;
matches with real guys.

03:44.421 --> 03:46.822
So...

03:46.857 --> 03:49.859
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

03:49.893 --> 03:51.493
- What?
- Nothing...

03:51.528 --> 03:53.663
Oh, no. We're just working
on some dude ranch stuff.

03:53.697 --> 03:56.699
Okay, you and I need to go
exercise Trouble and Phoenix.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.534
If you don't mind helping me
with some of the other horses

03:58.568 --> 04:00.169
I'm just getting behind.

04:00.203 --> 04:01.470
Yeah sure.

04:01.504 --> 04:02.971
- Bye.
- See ya.

04:03.005 --> 04:04.673
Oops.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.314
- Amy.
- Hey, Cassandra.

04:13.348 --> 04:16.184
Hey. Sorry for just dropping by.

04:16.218 --> 04:18.386
I'm running low on deworming
paste at the clinic.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.786
Ty said he had some extra stock?

04:19.821 --> 04:21.353
Yeah, I'm sure there is some
in the barn office.

04:21.389 --> 04:23.256
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

04:23.291 --> 04:26.226
How's it going with Ty and
Scott away at that conference?

04:26.260 --> 04:28.796
Clinic can seems a little empty.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.031
I know the feeling.

04:31.066 --> 04:33.667
Easy, Trouble. Come on, Phoenix.

04:33.702 --> 04:35.069
Come on, get up.

04:35.103 --> 04:36.669
Hey, that's pretty cool.

04:36.704 --> 04:39.471
Yeah, they've really got that
part down.

04:39.506 --> 04:42.075
If only we could just get this
new element worked out.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.476
We're trying to add a bit
of a wow factor to the jump,

04:44.511 --> 04:46.746
but Trouble can't stick
the landing.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.281
- Trouble?
- He's the horse on her right.

04:49.316 --> 04:52.085
It's almost like he's afraid
of the water or something.

04:52.119 --> 04:54.352
Do his front legs
look a little stiff?

04:59.491 --> 05:01.126
- Oof! Agh!
- Oh my God!

05:02.528 --> 05:03.895
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.297
Hey, boys.

05:06.332 --> 05:08.366
I'm fine.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.267
Trouble still isn't getting it,
though.

05:10.301 --> 05:12.636
Because he's hurt.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.939
From what I can see,
Trouble's in a lot of pain.

05:18.612 --> 05:21.976
S09E12
The Real Deal

05:22.200 --> 05:25.696
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

05:59.682 --> 06:01.182
How much has he been training?

06:01.216 --> 06:03.651
I guess we've stepped it up
a bit lately.

06:03.685 --> 06:05.820
Well, I don't see any signs
of an injury,

06:05.854 --> 06:07.188
but I'm sure with the added
workload

06:07.222 --> 06:08.923
has caused some wear and tear.

06:12.527 --> 06:14.195
Whoa! Why's he doing that?

06:14.229 --> 06:16.664
I'm pressing key trigger points.

06:16.698 --> 06:18.832
Seems pretty sore
in his back muscles.

06:18.866 --> 06:20.233
Which makes sense...
with the roman riding

06:20.268 --> 06:22.669
and trying to land those jumps.
Well, do we have to stop?

06:22.703 --> 06:24.437
Well, I think he could use
some rest,

06:24.471 --> 06:26.472
but we can do other things
to help.

06:26.507 --> 06:27.874
Like anti-inflammatories?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.076
Yeah. Maybe some acupuncture.

06:30.111 --> 06:31.744
Well, I'm not sticking
needles in him?

06:31.779 --> 06:35.214
It's okay, Georgie, Cassandra
knows what she's doing.

06:35.248 --> 06:37.516
Ty told me you did acupuncture
with some dogs,

06:37.550 --> 06:40.052
and I'm totally open to it,
if you think it'll help.

06:40.086 --> 06:42.855
Well, can't hurt to try.

06:46.592 --> 06:49.195
Oh, you convinced her
to sign up, did you?

06:49.229 --> 06:49.734
Yeah...

06:49.766 --> 06:52.931
And she's turned this profile
into a full on biography.

06:52.965 --> 06:54.299
How am I supposed
to find a good match

06:54.333 --> 06:55.700
if they don't know who I am?

06:55.734 --> 06:57.101
Do you think they're gonna
reads this?

06:57.136 --> 06:58.502
It's all about the picture,
come on.

06:58.537 --> 07:01.072
- Well, I've already chosen one.
- Oh!

07:01.106 --> 07:03.574
- Oh.
- Really?

07:03.608 --> 07:06.410
- What?
- Well, it's just a bit...

07:06.445 --> 07:07.846
Conservative...

07:07.880 --> 07:10.413
I mean, you're not applying
for an office job, honey.

07:10.448 --> 07:13.183
Yeah. Maybe you should chose
one with like a little more um...

07:13.218 --> 07:15.618
Personality! Why don't you
show how fun you are.

07:15.653 --> 07:18.922
- This is very buttoned up.
- Oh, I get it.

07:18.957 --> 07:21.391
So by "fun" you mean...
show some cleavage.

07:21.425 --> 07:24.161
I didn't mean that,
of course that couldn't hurt.

07:24.195 --> 07:26.295
I want someone looking for
more substance then that.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.697
Well, it's hard to find
what someone's about

07:28.732 --> 07:31.901
if you can't get past the picture
enough to wanna ask them out.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.404
Look who it is!

07:35.438 --> 07:38.540
Why have you not been answering
my phone calls?

07:38.575 --> 07:41.410
Yeah. I wondered if it rang
a couple times.

07:41.444 --> 07:44.212
- A couple?
- But, then it would quit...

07:44.247 --> 07:45.947
Doesn't matter,
it's dead now any way.

07:45.982 --> 07:48.383
The battery isn't lasting
too long these days.

07:48.417 --> 07:49.784
You can buy a new one.

07:49.818 --> 07:51.953
No. You know how expensive
they are?

07:51.988 --> 07:54.789
Not as expensive as missing out
on a great deal on a winter ranch

07:54.823 --> 07:56.724
because I couldn't get you on
the line to ask you about dates.

07:56.759 --> 07:58.994
I'm sorry.

07:59.028 --> 08:01.929
Okay, I-I'll get a new battery.

08:06.601 --> 08:09.003
Hey, Turner.

08:09.037 --> 08:10.637
Hey, big man. How are you?

08:10.671 --> 08:12.006
Good. Good. How you doin'?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.573
- I'm great.
- Excellent.

08:13.608 --> 08:14.975
I haven't seen you in a while.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.510
No, I gotta say I was
surprised to hear from you

08:16.544 --> 08:17.877
after so many years.

08:17.912 --> 08:19.312
Oh, I'm not so good at
keeping up and stuff.

08:19.346 --> 08:20.947
But hey, you've done well.

08:20.981 --> 08:22.348
- Uh, not too bad.
- Yeah.

08:22.383 --> 08:24.450
So this the one you got
in mind for me?

08:24.484 --> 08:25.851
No. No, no, no...

08:25.886 --> 08:27.954
I'd like you to meet
Jade Virani.

08:27.988 --> 08:31.291
Jade is the best...
Well, probably the only

08:31.325 --> 08:32.857
female bronc rider
on the circuit.

08:32.893 --> 08:36.361
- Really? You ride broncs?
- Yes sir.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.630
Yeah, she is tearing up
the amateurs right now,

08:38.664 --> 08:40.232
and I thought you might
wanna scoop her up

08:40.265 --> 08:42.167
before she goes pro.

08:42.201 --> 08:44.502
Oh, sorry, but to look at you,

08:44.537 --> 08:47.172
I gotta say, I just don't see
bronc rider...

08:47.206 --> 08:48.873
Let me show you what I can do.

08:48.908 --> 08:52.343
Naw, that's okay...
I'm sold already.

08:52.377 --> 08:54.912
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:54.947 --> 08:58.082
Boom! Like that. See I told you!

08:58.116 --> 09:00.217
A girl who can actually rodeo

09:00.252 --> 09:02.386
that sends a positive message
to other young women.

09:02.421 --> 09:04.088
Yeah... and you gotta
see her ride?

09:04.122 --> 09:05.789
Do you wanna see her ride?

09:05.824 --> 09:08.724
Later. I'll come by tomorrow
work out all the details, okay?

09:08.759 --> 09:11.494
Okay. Oh and hey, great.

09:12.896 --> 09:15.398
You have the makings of a real
star, young lady.

09:18.369 --> 09:22.205
- Good to see you, bud.
- You too, man.

09:22.239 --> 09:23.968
Who's welcome?

09:24.083 --> 09:25.963
- Me! I am!
- You're welcome?

09:26.009 --> 09:30.245
Mr. Keith, pretty good decision
back there going with Jade.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.751
Could work out well.

09:31.817 --> 09:34.984
Might work out even better if you were
to bring on a second rodeo champ.

09:35.018 --> 09:37.453
Yeah? Got someone else in mind?

09:37.487 --> 09:39.921
Well, I don't know. Maybe
someone who's done it all...

09:39.956 --> 09:41.623
Broncs, bulls, roping...

09:41.657 --> 09:43.157
You can stop selling, Caleb.

09:43.192 --> 09:45.159
I'm well aware of your pedigree.

09:45.194 --> 09:47.228
Thought Tim brought me out here
to push you.

09:47.262 --> 09:50.831
But he's right.
Jade's more unique.

09:50.866 --> 09:53.567
Yeah... I've seen your ads.

09:53.602 --> 09:56.204
Typically they feature
a cowgirl and a cowboy.

09:56.238 --> 09:59.706
Can't help to think that
me and Jade both

09:59.740 --> 10:02.242
might make a pretty good fit
for tracker.

10:02.276 --> 10:05.212
Let me noodle on it, okay?

10:05.246 --> 10:06.679
All right.

10:10.051 --> 10:12.452
Do you like his facial hair?

10:12.487 --> 10:13.686
That's kind of, I don't know,
But it's a little bit...

10:13.721 --> 10:15.688
Wow... are those all your
matches?

10:15.723 --> 10:18.424
Yeah. I took forever to enter
them onto the spreadsheet.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.559
Into a spreadsheet?

10:20.593 --> 10:23.429
Yeah. I've rated each guy
against my wish list.

10:23.463 --> 10:26.098
And they had to measure out
8 out of 10 across the board.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.800
And surprisingly not one
single guy has measured up.

10:28.835 --> 10:32.471
Okay.
How about that guy?

10:32.506 --> 10:34.439
Well, I mean, he's in
the right height range,

10:34.473 --> 10:36.307
we have some mutual interests,

10:36.342 --> 10:38.043
you know, he keeps his facial
hair in check,

10:38.077 --> 10:40.578
but he rides a motorcycle so...
too reckless.

10:40.612 --> 10:42.180
Hm-hm. Definitely. Okay.

10:42.214 --> 10:43.548
How about that one?

10:43.582 --> 10:44.982
See this guy is really
well rounded...

10:45.017 --> 10:47.585
He's into literature,
and cooking and athletic.

10:47.619 --> 10:49.620
And look, plays the cello.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.621
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

10:51.656 --> 10:53.057
Either he's lying,

10:53.091 --> 10:54.824
trying to pretend he's some
renaissance man...

10:54.859 --> 10:57.261
or he actually plays the cello.

10:57.295 --> 11:00.797
- I'm going crazy...
- Okay. Really, Lou?

11:00.831 --> 11:03.267
I think you need to tone down
your expectations?

11:03.301 --> 11:04.834
Grandpa, do you hear this?

11:04.869 --> 11:06.937
I shouldn't have to settle,
right?

11:08.772 --> 11:11.740
No... No, you shouldn't.

11:11.775 --> 11:13.142
Thank you.

11:13.177 --> 11:17.380
But I suppose it's possible

11:17.414 --> 11:19.949
that maybe you setting
the bar so high

11:19.983 --> 11:26.362
might be your way of avoiding
an actual date? Just sayin'.

11:26.622 --> 11:29.857
- Fine. I'll pick one.
- Okay.

11:29.892 --> 11:32.194
I guess he seems okay.

11:32.228 --> 11:34.463
- And handsome.
- "Strong family values".

11:34.497 --> 11:36.064
His favorite band is Nickelback.

11:36.099 --> 11:38.100
- Lou!
- Okay, okay.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.972
Hey Ty.

11:45.006 --> 11:48.209
Yeah. Well, I'm all ready
for our skype date.

11:50.579 --> 11:54.033
Oh no. That's okay.

11:54.416 --> 11:57.017
Yeah. You go to your cocktail
reception thingy.

11:57.051 --> 12:00.286
That's fine. We can just...
We'll skype tomorrow night.

12:00.321 --> 12:02.188
Okay.

12:02.223 --> 12:05.057
I love you. Bye.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.706
Hey, um, are you expecting Jade?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.108
No. Why?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.043
I thought I just saw her car
pull in.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.079
No. Hey...

12:28.114 --> 12:30.849
I was just driving by
and had to tell you the news...

12:30.883 --> 12:33.184
Guess who just landed
her first big sponsorship?

12:33.218 --> 12:34.752
No way. That's awesome!

12:34.786 --> 12:36.854
Yeah. Tim set it up
with tracker western wear.

12:36.888 --> 12:38.856
- That's so cool.
- I know, right?

12:38.890 --> 12:41.526
- Yeah. Congrats.
- Thank you.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.962
Well... that's all!
So... Good night.

12:44.996 --> 12:47.131
Wait. Seriously? That's all
you came over here to tell us?

12:47.166 --> 12:50.167
Yeah... Well...
Oh, and don't worry...

12:50.201 --> 12:53.036
I won't forget you guys
when I'm all famous n' stuff.

12:53.070 --> 12:54.837
Good night.

12:54.872 --> 12:58.422
What?

12:58.976 --> 13:01.611
I don't know... It's just...

13:01.646 --> 13:03.913
Jade just started
as a bronc rider,

13:03.947 --> 13:05.848
I hope my dad is not putting
too much pressure on her.

13:05.883 --> 13:07.783
But isn't a sponsor
a good thing?

13:07.817 --> 13:12.221
Yeah, but it also brings on
a lot of expectations.

13:12.255 --> 13:14.423
I don't know, I just hope
Jade is ready for it.

13:20.129 --> 13:25.533
I don't know how I feel about
all this online dating crap.

13:25.568 --> 13:28.670
Well, you remember the time
Mallory signed you up

13:28.704 --> 13:30.305
to find your perfect match?

13:30.339 --> 13:32.707
And the first person
that came up was me.

13:32.741 --> 13:35.310
That was kinda bang on,
wasn't it?

13:35.344 --> 13:36.944
I just don't know what happened

13:36.978 --> 13:40.447
to meeting someone
under normal circumstances?

13:40.481 --> 13:42.816
The way people used to.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.784
Singles bars?

13:44.819 --> 13:47.421
I was thinking more along
the lines of...

13:47.455 --> 13:50.757
oh, I don't know,
a nice barbecue.

13:50.791 --> 13:52.259
Like one I remember.

13:56.497 --> 13:58.464
Hey, speaking of old timey
notions,

13:58.498 --> 14:01.667
have you found a battery for that
archaic flip phone of yours?

14:01.702 --> 14:04.370
Uh, no... But...

14:04.404 --> 14:06.572
No, no buts.
You're getting a new one...

14:06.607 --> 14:09.141
But, actually... actually...

14:09.175 --> 14:11.611
turns out they don't make
that battery anymore.

14:11.645 --> 14:13.279
Of course they don't.

14:13.313 --> 14:15.146
Well, I tried.

14:18.651 --> 14:21.753
I wanna be completely
honest and upfront with you.

14:21.787 --> 14:24.188
Okay...

14:24.223 --> 14:26.291
Um, I get that there have
been lots of changes lately...

14:26.325 --> 14:29.127
and I don't want to add
to all that.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.928
This really isn't a big deal.

14:30.963 --> 14:33.764
But I get that you may have
mixed emotions about it so...

14:33.798 --> 14:36.467
Can you just spit it out?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.502
I've decided to start
dating again.

14:38.536 --> 14:39.903
No one in particular,

14:39.937 --> 14:43.240
just kind of putting myself
back out there.

14:43.275 --> 14:47.177
Wait, so that's all
this is about?

14:47.211 --> 14:48.678
You're okay with this?

14:48.712 --> 14:51.681
Well, Peter already has
a girlfriend so...

14:51.715 --> 14:54.183
Yeah, and I know that
that was shocking for you

14:54.217 --> 14:57.620
to come face to face
with that... with her.

14:57.655 --> 15:00.790
And I just don't want you to go
through that all over again.

15:00.824 --> 15:04.294
So I'm gonna keep you in the
loop every step of the way.

15:04.328 --> 15:07.128
Uh... Okay. Sure.

15:07.163 --> 15:09.030
Okay.

15:21.952 --> 15:23.018
Hey there.

15:23.524 --> 15:24.981
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi.

15:26.915 --> 15:30.751
Oh, look at you. Are you all
excited for your big date?

15:30.786 --> 15:32.787
Hmm. Terrified is more like it.

15:32.821 --> 15:35.354
Oh, come on now,
relax and enjoy yourself.

15:35.389 --> 15:36.723
You have back-up matches,
don't you?

15:36.757 --> 15:38.959
She even got more this
morning when she logged in

15:38.993 --> 15:40.894
Some that were even
spreadsheet-worthy.

15:40.928 --> 15:42.660
I would not go that far.

15:43.731 --> 15:46.733
Hello you. I have a present
for you.

15:46.767 --> 15:48.902
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

15:48.936 --> 15:52.605
- Hmm.
- It's a new smart phone.

15:52.639 --> 15:55.440
C'mon no, Lis, you know
I like the one I've got.

15:55.475 --> 15:58.443
Yeah. I don't.
Actually this one works.

15:58.478 --> 16:00.445
Well... I like the holster.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.316
Okay. C'mon, this has some
very cool functions

16:04.350 --> 16:06.685
and great apps. And it's more
than just a phone,

16:06.720 --> 16:09.020
it's like a whole lifestyle.

16:09.054 --> 16:11.555
Enjoy your new lifestyle, grampa.

16:14.171 --> 16:15.927
You wanna sign Caleb?

16:15.961 --> 16:17.294
You don't have to sound
so surprised.

16:17.329 --> 16:18.696
I thought you wanted
to sign Jade?

16:18.731 --> 16:20.431
No, I am.

16:20.465 --> 16:22.266
I just think these two would
work well together.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.636
Sort of a beauty
and the beast kinda thing.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.770
- Hmm.
- I'm really excited about this.

16:26.804 --> 16:29.172
I'm already setting up
a photo shoot.

16:29.206 --> 16:31.307
And if it goes well I might
consider doing a TV spot.

16:31.342 --> 16:33.510
- Tv?
- That would be really cool.

16:33.544 --> 16:35.145
Yeah. First things first.

16:35.179 --> 16:36.613
I need you both to sign off
on these contracts.

16:36.648 --> 16:38.481
That sir is not a problem.

16:38.516 --> 16:40.416
I'm gonna read that that.

16:40.451 --> 16:42.152
Well, suit yourself.

16:42.186 --> 16:44.620
But I wanted to get the photo
shoot done in a couple of days

16:44.655 --> 16:46.088
so... chop chop.

16:46.123 --> 16:47.923
Well, you haven't even seen
her ride yet.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.659
I mean, I brought stock
and everything today.

16:49.693 --> 16:51.160
But I gotta start lining
things up.

16:51.194 --> 16:53.228
Besides, I've had my ear
to the ground.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.665
And the word is, she's great!

16:58.735 --> 17:00.135
All right.

17:06.575 --> 17:10.278
It's okay, Trouble.

17:10.311 --> 17:12.445
He's fine, Georgie.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.182
Horses actually enjoy this.

17:14.215 --> 17:16.151
It causes a real endorphin
release.

17:21.021 --> 17:22.856
What's with him?

17:22.891 --> 17:25.125
Oh, that's Ty's horse, Harley.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.194
He's been a little bit more
restless than usual.

17:27.228 --> 17:29.229
Maybe he could use some
acupuncture.

17:29.263 --> 17:31.865
Well, all he needs
is some exercise.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.266
Everybody's been so busy lately

17:33.301 --> 17:36.335
we haven't got the horses
out enough.

17:38.739 --> 17:40.106
Look at that.

17:40.140 --> 17:41.974
He's seems pretty relaxed.

17:42.009 --> 17:44.376
Told you. They love this.

17:46.213 --> 17:49.692
So... Nickelback.

17:50.217 --> 17:52.851
Really? On your profile?

17:52.885 --> 17:54.853
And yet you still
messaged me.

17:54.887 --> 17:58.690
Oh, well, let's just say your "strong
family values" made up for it.

17:58.725 --> 18:01.993
Funny, that was actually the biggest
issue between my ex and me.

18:02.028 --> 18:04.129
Oh? How so?

18:04.163 --> 18:05.931
I guess I thought we were
both on the same page.

18:05.965 --> 18:08.866
Once kids came along that...

18:08.900 --> 18:10.901
Well, let's just say she spent
a lot of time at the office.

18:10.936 --> 18:11.766
Oh, yeah.

18:11.911 --> 18:14.939
It's tough to strike a healthy
work-home balance, isn't it?

18:14.973 --> 18:17.975
Yeah, but work didn't have to
be part of the equation for her.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.878
I mean, I made more than enough
money for both of us.

18:20.912 --> 18:23.547
So you wanted her to stay home?

18:23.581 --> 18:25.782
I know it sounds old fashioned,

18:25.816 --> 18:28.118
but when you start a family...

18:28.152 --> 18:30.053
I just think someone needs
to be there as a constant.

18:30.087 --> 18:33.289
Hmm. And by "someone" you
mean the woman?

18:33.323 --> 18:35.892
Whoever earns less money.
Just makes sense.

18:35.926 --> 18:39.229
Not really. Since women still
aren't paid on par with men.

18:39.263 --> 18:42.297
Yeah, but that's just
because woman aren't as,

18:42.331 --> 18:43.698
you know, career-focused
as men are.

18:43.733 --> 18:45.634
That's not true!

18:45.668 --> 18:48.203
We just have to "focus"
on doing our jobs

18:48.238 --> 18:50.105
and most of the work at home.

18:50.140 --> 18:52.875
You know what, I actually can't
believe we're sitting here

18:52.909 --> 18:54.643
debating gender roles...

18:54.677 --> 18:56.078
I think I'm gonna get out
of here.

18:56.112 --> 18:57.880
But we just got here.
I mean, what time is it?

18:57.914 --> 19:01.015
Oh, I don't now, I'd say
about half past 1965.

19:09.424 --> 19:13.094
Hey Tim, what's the hold up
with my contract?

19:13.128 --> 19:15.096
Just... Come here.

19:22.636 --> 19:25.005
I read it over,
you're not signing this.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.907
What are you talking about?

19:26.941 --> 19:28.474
Turner's trying to pull
a fast one on you.

19:28.509 --> 19:30.877
He's trying to control
what rodeos you ride in.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.056
Why would he want to do that?

19:32.155 --> 19:34.530
Because he wants you to win
the second rate rodeos,

19:34.612 --> 19:37.049
but he's not gonna let you get
anywhere near the tougher horses

19:37.083 --> 19:39.318
or any real competition.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.253
But that doesn't make sense.

19:41.288 --> 19:42.482
All the people are
at the big rodeos.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.379
- Why wouldn't he want me there?
- Well, he does want you there,

19:44.444 --> 19:46.258
but he wants you there
on a promotion capacity.

19:46.308 --> 19:48.427
You're gonna be standing
by a booth hawking his good.

19:48.461 --> 19:49.795
You're never gonna ride, Jade,

19:49.829 --> 19:51.729
You're gonna be a glorified
spokes-model.

19:51.763 --> 19:53.198
We're walking away from this.

19:53.232 --> 19:56.801
- We?
- "We" I'm your coach, I got you this far.

19:56.836 --> 19:59.304
No. The photo shoot's tomorrow.

19:59.338 --> 20:01.672
I could be on magazine covers,
billboards,

20:01.707 --> 20:04.342
and maybe even on tv...

20:04.376 --> 20:06.077
Why would I walk away from this?

20:06.111 --> 20:07.811
I mean, it was your idea to get
a sponsor in the first place.

20:07.846 --> 20:09.546
Yeah. It was-it was my idea.
That's right.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.081
But you need the right sponsor.

20:11.115 --> 20:12.649
And I gonna help you find it.

20:12.683 --> 20:14.617
Do you think he cares
about your career?

20:14.652 --> 20:16.728
He doesn't even wanna
watch you ride.

20:17.856 --> 20:19.289
I'm eighteen now...

20:19.324 --> 20:21.892
I don't need you or anyone else
to signing off on this.

20:28.232 --> 20:30.366
Hey, Ty. Looks like I missed
you again.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.501
Just give me a call
when you get this.

20:32.535 --> 20:36.272
I hope everything
is going well. Love you.

20:36.306 --> 20:39.208
Seems like they're pretty
busy at that conference, huh?

20:39.243 --> 20:40.576
Seems like. Yeah.

20:40.610 --> 20:42.418
You're all done with Trouble?

20:42.484 --> 20:44.445
Yeah, he responded really
well. Completely pain-free.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.381
- Good. That's amazing.
- Yeah.

20:46.415 --> 20:48.083
So, can we start training again?

20:48.117 --> 20:50.018
Well, I would start with
some light exercise,

20:50.052 --> 20:52.254
see how he feels.
And then we'll go from there.

20:52.288 --> 20:54.222
Okay. Well, thank you.

20:54.257 --> 20:56.624
Yeah, no problem.
He was a great patient.

20:57.858 --> 21:02.229
Uh, you know, I have a few field
calls to do around here tomorrow.

21:02.264 --> 21:04.999
Maybe I could drop by
for tea or something?

21:05.033 --> 21:08.235
Yeah, uh... yeah, sure.
I'll be around.

21:08.270 --> 21:09.870
Okay. Cool. I'll see you then.

21:09.905 --> 21:11.671
Okay. Cool.

21:13.808 --> 21:15.909
Oh look, how it is.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.011
Your GG is using his new phone.

21:18.045 --> 21:21.747
So you figured out how
to use it, eh?

21:21.782 --> 21:24.640
Jack? Hello?

21:27.187 --> 21:31.124
Jack? Jack!

21:37.696 --> 21:39.597
Hmm. All right.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.804
Hello?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.205
Jack!

21:48.874 --> 21:50.207
Jack!!!

21:51.643 --> 21:53.144
Oh no!

21:54.612 --> 21:55.980
What's going on?

21:56.014 --> 21:57.881
Oh, I think Jack
is "butt dialing" me.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.318
- Butt dialing?
- Oh no!

22:00.352 --> 22:03.520
Oops.

22:03.555 --> 22:04.922
- Oh Hi!
- Hey guys...

22:04.957 --> 22:06.456
Oh!

22:06.490 --> 22:07.602
Hey, uh, now that you're
finished this,

22:07.651 --> 22:09.630
why don't you go get the other
one with the fuzzy bear on it,

22:09.712 --> 22:10.834
we'll start that one?
How about that?

22:10.916 --> 22:12.528
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:14.265 --> 22:15.631
How was it?

22:15.666 --> 22:17.800
Okay. That bad?

22:17.835 --> 22:19.869
I don't even know
where to start.

22:19.903 --> 22:24.106
Um, I think I'm gonna go
help Katie find that puzzle.

22:25.752 --> 22:27.742
All right.
Well, it's the first match.

22:27.777 --> 22:30.645
You can't let one bad apple
spoil the whole barrel.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.314
Oh my God. That's what
this is like, isn't it?

22:32.349 --> 22:34.316
It's like shopping
for produce online.

22:35.647 --> 22:38.954
No, it's more like
finding a perfect home.

22:38.989 --> 22:40.355
You can't expect
the first time out

22:40.389 --> 22:42.223
you're gonna find the right
one so...

22:42.257 --> 22:43.824
Come on, Amy said that there
were other matches.

22:43.859 --> 22:46.160
Let's look at them. Come on.

22:48.438 --> 22:50.202
Fine...

22:53.039 --> 22:55.470
Nice timing.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.670
Yeah, well, I had business
with Jade.

22:57.705 --> 22:59.606
Yeah, I noticed.
What was that all about?

22:59.640 --> 23:02.209
- Oh, I screwed up.
- No? You?

23:02.243 --> 23:04.077
I'm trying to help her get
a sponsorship deal

23:04.112 --> 23:06.413
with this clothing company.

23:06.447 --> 23:08.015
I don't think the guy
that owns it

23:08.049 --> 23:10.517
cares what she can do
on a bronc.

23:10.551 --> 23:11.985
He just sees another
pretty face.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.553
Well, you could've seen
that coming.

23:13.587 --> 23:16.155
Yeah. Well, now she won't
listen to me.

23:16.189 --> 23:19.691
She thinks he's gonna make her
a big star.

23:19.726 --> 23:21.660
I don't know, I don't think
I get through to her?

23:21.694 --> 23:24.296
- Well, I doubt you can...
- Great. Thanks.

23:24.331 --> 23:27.133
Oh, no, I'm not saying that she
can't be turned around on this,

23:27.167 --> 23:31.536
but I just don't think
you're the guy to do it.

23:31.570 --> 23:34.506
Should be someone a little
closer in age.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.774
A talented and attractive
young woman

23:36.808 --> 23:39.344
who's also had to deal
with sponsors

23:39.378 --> 23:41.746
trying to capitalize on that.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.781
Amy.

23:49.987 --> 23:52.722
- Hey...
- Hey...

23:52.757 --> 23:54.791
I was kind of surprised
to get your call.

23:54.825 --> 23:58.395
Yeah. This sponsorship deal
sounds pretty exciting.

23:58.430 --> 24:00.397
I just wanted to hear
more about it.

24:00.432 --> 24:03.600
- Oh... really?
- Yeah. Like this photo shoot?

24:03.634 --> 24:05.868
Tim talked to you, didn't he?

24:05.902 --> 24:08.204
Yeah, he did...

24:08.238 --> 24:09.572
I'm outta here.

24:09.606 --> 24:12.308
Wait! He's just looking out
for you. Jade, hey!

24:12.342 --> 24:14.643
Can you at least hear me out?

24:17.147 --> 24:21.584
A few years ago I went on this thing
called "The ring of fire" tour.

24:21.618 --> 24:23.251
We went from town to town,

24:23.286 --> 24:25.387
making a show out
of gentling colts.

24:25.421 --> 24:27.689
And I was approached
by a few sponsors.

24:27.723 --> 24:31.059
You know, they said they didn't want
some random model to push their product.

24:31.094 --> 24:34.629
They wanted someone
with a little more cred.

24:34.663 --> 24:36.965
But the thing was,
there was lots of people

24:36.999 --> 24:39.900
with more experience
than I had at the time.

24:39.934 --> 24:42.736
They just weren't
the right "look".

24:42.770 --> 24:44.738
And that's how they put it.

24:44.772 --> 24:47.975
So I decided to turn them down.

24:48.009 --> 24:50.211
Because it was more important
to me

24:50.245 --> 24:51.745
to be respected by my peers

24:51.779 --> 24:55.282
than be the girl with
"the look".

24:57.251 --> 25:00.153
Well... good for you.

25:00.187 --> 25:02.555
But that was your decision.

25:06.494 --> 25:08.761
- She just wants to help you.
- Yeah, right.

25:08.795 --> 25:10.563
She probably just regrets
not going for it

25:10.598 --> 25:12.064
while she had the chance.

25:12.099 --> 25:14.133
And Tim, he just feels
threatened

25:14.167 --> 25:17.302
that he doesn't have complete
control over my rodeo career.

25:17.337 --> 25:19.971
Do you really want to be some
kind of poster-girl?

25:20.006 --> 25:23.342
I can't believe it.
You're jealous too?

25:23.376 --> 25:25.710
No. I'm just trying
to be your friend.

25:25.745 --> 25:28.747
This is the most exciting
thing that's ever happened to me

25:28.781 --> 25:30.515
and you're all ruining it.

25:30.549 --> 25:31.915
If this is your idea
of friendship,

25:31.950 --> 25:33.851
then you can keep it.

25:45.856 --> 25:47.791
So did you have any luck
with Jade?

25:47.825 --> 25:51.360
I'm sorry. I tried, but she's
really got her heart set on it.

25:51.395 --> 25:52.962
Dammit.

25:52.996 --> 25:55.264
She's just gonna regret
this deal. I know it.

25:55.299 --> 25:57.200
- Okay. You gotta come with me.
- Where?

25:57.234 --> 25:59.372
To this photo session thing.

25:59.469 --> 26:02.305
Amy please, I know she's gonna
dump me as her coach,

26:02.339 --> 26:04.473
but I can't stand by
and just watch her screw up

26:04.508 --> 26:05.874
everything she's worked
so hard for.

26:05.909 --> 26:07.375
Please, will you help me?

26:07.410 --> 26:09.444
Dad, I can't. I've got too
much to do around here.

26:09.478 --> 26:12.323
And besides, I don't think
there is thing else I can say.

26:12.439 --> 26:14.282
I'll go.

26:18.387 --> 26:20.090
Okay.

26:20.898 --> 26:22.957
Thanks for agreeing
to meet up.

26:22.991 --> 26:25.960
I have to admit, I'm kind of new
to this online dating thing.

26:25.994 --> 26:29.163
Yeah. Me too...

26:29.198 --> 26:32.266
I know, it's an old picture.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.935
I guess you could say that
I've evolved since then...

26:33.969 --> 26:36.570
Yeah. So has your hair.

26:36.605 --> 26:38.672
Yeah.

26:38.707 --> 26:42.943
So, your profile says you
have a fine arts degree?

26:42.977 --> 26:44.978
Yeah. I'm a glass blower.

26:45.012 --> 26:47.114
Oh, that sounds like a cool
career.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.815
You know what, it is.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.250
You know, especially since
I quit my job.

26:50.284 --> 26:51.818
Oh... Really...

26:51.853 --> 26:54.955
I worked in a factory making
beakers and test tubes.

26:54.989 --> 26:58.190
Hm. I guess that's not the most
interesting use of your training.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.725
Yeah, Amen.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.062
So I decided to get back
to feeding my creative soul.

27:03.096 --> 27:04.696
Making art.

27:04.731 --> 27:07.699
Well, I'd love to see your
art. Where do you sell it?

27:09.077 --> 27:13.538
Well... uh, I actually
haven't put it out there yet.

27:13.573 --> 27:15.940
It's hard to explain,

27:15.975 --> 27:19.010
I just feel like I need enough
pieces to tell a story.

27:19.044 --> 27:22.511
Okay. What kind of story?

27:23.015 --> 27:26.584
It's a good question.

27:26.618 --> 27:28.086
I-I'm not sure actually.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.321
I'm still working on it.

27:30.355 --> 27:31.855
Uh-ha.

27:31.890 --> 27:33.523
But I better figure it out soon.

27:33.557 --> 27:37.294
My ex-wife's support payments
they're killing me.

27:37.328 --> 27:39.496
They're hardly enough for me
to get by on.

27:57.681 --> 27:59.115
Do you think we can take
a break for a minute?

27:59.149 --> 28:02.451
Sure. I wanna
run an idea past Turner anyway.

28:06.388 --> 28:08.223
If you guys came here to gang
up on me it's too late.

28:08.257 --> 28:10.591
I already signed the contract.

28:10.626 --> 28:13.228
You-you look amazing.

28:13.262 --> 28:15.463
Tough, but really pretty too.

28:15.497 --> 28:17.598
- Glad I have your approval.
- Hey, Jade...

28:17.633 --> 28:20.035
Oh hey, buddy.

28:20.069 --> 28:22.736
We've got a change of wardrobe
before the next setup.

28:22.770 --> 28:24.571
I want to feature our new line
of jean shorts.

28:24.605 --> 28:27.875
I don't know, man, those
shorts they're pretty short.

28:27.909 --> 28:29.409
I know. We used to call
them "daisy dukes".

28:29.444 --> 28:33.380
But I'm a bronc rider.
I'd never wear these.

28:33.414 --> 28:34.694
Oh, I get that...

28:34.826 --> 28:37.818
But in this shot we're gonna have
Caleb on a horse in the chute...

28:37.853 --> 28:39.785
and then you're gonna be
on the fencing,

28:39.820 --> 28:42.588
turned back towards camera.
Something a bit more artistic...

28:42.622 --> 28:45.024
No, no. This is bull.

28:45.059 --> 28:46.400
Turner this is the only reason
you signed her, isn't is?

28:46.417 --> 28:48.412
You didn't care that
she was a great bronc rider

28:48.495 --> 28:50.629
you just wanted her to be one
of your cowgirl barbie dolls.

28:50.664 --> 28:52.098
No!

28:52.132 --> 28:55.534
You know what, that's my
business, isn't it?

28:55.569 --> 28:57.669
And if you want me
to sponsor you

28:57.703 --> 28:59.137
you put on the damn shorts.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.572
Jade, come on!

29:00.606 --> 29:04.642
No Tim, this is my decision,
okay? Not yours.

29:05.587 --> 29:08.146
Could you please just go?

29:17.222 --> 29:20.157
All right, let's get to work.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.605
Hi. Lou, right?

29:35.639 --> 29:38.674
- Yeah. You must be Mitch.
- Yeah. Hi.

29:38.709 --> 29:40.676
Shall I grab us a table?

29:40.711 --> 29:44.580
Um, you know, I could really
use a change of venue.

29:44.615 --> 29:47.182
Yeah, I'm game for that.

29:47.217 --> 29:49.018
Something about sitting across
a table on a first date

29:49.052 --> 29:51.320
it feels like a job interview
anyways.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.622
- Yeah.
- How about a walk?

29:53.656 --> 29:56.892
- Sure. I'll get my jacket.
- Sure.

30:02.198 --> 30:04.799
Thanks.

30:14.576 --> 30:16.210
How's he doing?

30:16.245 --> 30:18.846
- Seems like a new horse.
- That's great.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.381
And I'm happy to check up on him

30:20.416 --> 30:21.815
as you pick up the training.

30:21.849 --> 30:26.386
Hey, um, about that tea...
You still up for it?

30:26.421 --> 30:28.255
About that...

30:28.289 --> 30:30.023
My day is way busier
than I thought...

30:30.058 --> 30:31.491
I'm so sorry, but can we...

30:31.525 --> 30:33.593
Yeah. No, you know, it's okay...

30:33.627 --> 30:36.063
I mean, it's fine
you have to do this.

30:36.097 --> 30:37.831
Do what?

30:39.333 --> 30:41.233
I don't know if Ty talked to you

30:41.268 --> 30:42.935
or if you just feel sorry for me,

30:42.970 --> 30:45.904
but I'm okay. Honestly.

30:45.939 --> 30:48.740
You don't have to go out of
your way to hang out with me.

30:48.775 --> 30:52.078
Oh... O-kay...

30:52.112 --> 30:53.912
I appreciate the offer.

30:53.947 --> 30:57.449
But, you know, I'm pretty good
on my own.

31:07.793 --> 31:10.828
I already put in my password.

31:10.863 --> 31:13.597
- What did I make a mistake or...
- Oh! What are you two up to?

31:13.631 --> 31:17.934
Well, I'm trying to look at
this farmer's almanac app thing.

31:17.969 --> 31:20.871
But my fingers are so clumsy I
can't push the right buttons.

31:20.905 --> 31:22.272
Oh, you're right.
Let me take a look at it.

31:22.307 --> 31:24.208
You know, I'll deal
with it later.

31:24.242 --> 31:26.610
I just, I gotta get going.

31:26.644 --> 31:27.978
All right.

31:28.013 --> 31:32.315
No more butt dialing, GG.

31:35.819 --> 31:37.620
Come on, let's go clean
your room up.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.255
- Okay.
- Bye.

31:39.289 --> 31:40.656
I can't believe you went
to school in New York.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.458
Really? Why?

31:42.493 --> 31:46.142
It's just so not Hudson.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.196
Well, I knew I wanted
to go away,

31:48.231 --> 31:52.800
so I made a short list of the
best business schools and...

31:52.835 --> 31:54.469
Well, I did up this
spreadsheet...

31:54.504 --> 31:56.905
- A spreadsheet?
- Yeah, you know...

31:56.939 --> 31:58.473
Factored in everything that
would go into my decision...

31:58.508 --> 32:00.942
and then Columbia won out.

32:00.976 --> 32:03.377
- Wow, that sounds so...
- Logical?

32:03.412 --> 32:05.779
I was going to say
anal retentive...

32:05.813 --> 32:07.381
- Thanks a lot. Thanks.
- Yeah.

32:08.150 --> 32:11.452
Okay. Full disclosure...

32:11.486 --> 32:15.822
A spreadsheet is actually why I
agreed to go out with you today.

32:15.857 --> 32:19.260
It worked for choosing a
school, why not finding a guy?

32:19.294 --> 32:20.660
You know how crazy
that sounds, right?

32:20.694 --> 32:22.795
Yes, because if I knew a guy
ranked women

32:22.829 --> 32:26.399
on some ridiculous spreadsheet,
he wouldn't even make mine.

32:31.072 --> 32:33.673
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

32:33.707 --> 32:37.543
- Sorry, I thought...
- No, I'm not-I'm not ready for that. I...

32:37.577 --> 32:40.011
For what? It was just a kiss.

32:40.046 --> 32:43.348
I know. I'm just...
I'm just easing back into this.

32:43.383 --> 32:45.717
So I'm-I'm looking
to take things slow,

32:45.751 --> 32:49.721
But if you're cool with that,
then I'd like to see you again.

32:51.324 --> 32:53.292
Yeah. I had-I had fun too...

32:53.326 --> 32:56.194
It was really great meeting
you, I just, I think...

32:56.228 --> 32:59.230
I think we're both looking
for different things right now.

32:59.264 --> 33:02.187
Oh. Okay.

33:03.102 --> 33:05.369
Good luck with that spreadsheet.

33:30.853 --> 33:33.354
You're really gonna wear that?

33:33.388 --> 33:35.356
I don't know.

33:35.390 --> 33:38.058
Turner hasn't given me
much of a choice.

33:39.861 --> 33:42.429
But it's just not me.
I'm a bronc rider.

33:42.464 --> 33:45.833
I mean, how is anybody supposed
to take me seriously?

33:45.867 --> 33:48.736
Yeah. I'm sorry, Jade,
this is all my fault.

33:48.770 --> 33:50.470
What?

33:50.504 --> 33:53.205
Yeah, If a hadn't pushed
to be a part of this.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.875
It'd be you on that horse
if I wasn't here.

33:55.909 --> 33:59.379
No. It would be some other
cowboy.

33:59.413 --> 34:03.349
Turner clearly has his own ideas
of a women's place in the rodeo

34:03.384 --> 34:07.519
and that's looking pretty,
make that trashy,

34:07.553 --> 34:09.755
standing on the sidelines
cheering on the guys.

34:12.625 --> 34:15.726
Well, maybe we should show
him just how stupid this looks.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.029
What do you mean?

34:18.063 --> 34:20.699
I got it covered.

34:20.733 --> 34:23.034
Please call me back
when you get this,

34:23.068 --> 34:26.235
I just like to know
if you talk to her at least.

34:26.271 --> 34:28.170
I love you.

34:29.940 --> 34:31.275
Everything okay?

34:31.309 --> 34:33.844
Yeah. I think I might have
offended Cassandra.

34:33.879 --> 34:35.379
Oh?

34:35.414 --> 34:37.080
She suggested that we hang out,

34:37.114 --> 34:39.417
but I thought it was only
because Ty put her up to it

34:39.451 --> 34:42.284
because he felt guilty
for being away.

34:42.319 --> 34:45.554
But what if he didn't?
I totally just blew her off.

34:45.589 --> 34:47.290
Oh? Well...

34:47.324 --> 34:48.891
What are you guys looking for?

34:48.926 --> 34:51.594
We are looking for Katie's
markers.

34:51.629 --> 34:54.931
Oh. Well, maybe grampa knows.
You should text him.

34:54.965 --> 34:56.766
Oh, you think he'll respond?

34:56.801 --> 34:59.468
You never know.

34:59.502 --> 35:01.570
So what do you think
that I should do?

35:01.604 --> 35:03.371
'Cause I feel bad.

35:03.406 --> 35:06.708
I would just apologize,
she'll understand.

35:06.743 --> 35:09.377
You didn't want her to feel
sorry for you or whatever.

35:09.412 --> 35:11.346
Yeah, I guess.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.749
Oh somebody is embracing
technology.

35:13.783 --> 35:15.817
- Um...
- What?

35:17.285 --> 35:22.045
Oh, it just... He... I gotta...

35:22.257 --> 35:25.125
Can you just wants Katie
for a minute please.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.594
Yeah, sure.

35:26.628 --> 35:29.277
But you're kinda freaking me
out! What's going on?

35:30.799 --> 35:33.199
Good luck
with your spreadsheet.

35:35.069 --> 35:37.390
Hey, sweetheart. Hey Dad.

35:38.539 --> 35:39.873
What's with him?

35:39.907 --> 35:41.641
Don't get him started.

35:41.676 --> 35:43.042
She told me to get lost.

35:43.077 --> 35:45.479
- Who did?
- Jade.

35:45.513 --> 35:49.414
You know, I get it. You know,
she wants to be a star, right?

35:49.449 --> 35:50.783
But she's naive?

35:50.817 --> 35:53.418
She can't see through
that sleezeball.

35:53.453 --> 35:54.987
What sleezeball?

35:55.021 --> 35:56.755
I'm telling you, I'm not
gonna let him get away with it.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.423
Okay, I have no idea
what this is about.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.493
But is sounds like you're gonna
do something stupid.

36:00.527 --> 36:03.629
I did something stupid
when I introduced her to him.

36:06.866 --> 36:10.167
Wow. I didn't think anyone could
be having a worse day than me.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.537
Let me tell you something
about internet dating...

36:12.571 --> 36:17.418
- Actually, maybe just don't.
- Oh... Okay.

36:17.610 --> 36:20.545
It's fine, it's just I rather
talk about something else...

36:20.579 --> 36:22.380
anything else.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.781
Right. Honey, I'm sorry.
I should have realized...

36:24.816 --> 36:27.951
I mean, you must hate the idea of
your parents dating other people.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.987
No, No. That's not it at all.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.655
I want you to be happy
you deserve that,

36:31.689 --> 36:37.060
But all the details...
No kid wants to hear that.

36:37.094 --> 36:39.262
Right.

36:53.376 --> 36:57.004
- Jack!? Are you okay?
- Yes!?

36:57.479 --> 36:58.813
Well, you said you were
having chest pains.

36:58.848 --> 37:00.281
- No.
- In your text.

37:00.315 --> 37:03.552
- What text?
- You wrote.

37:03.586 --> 37:05.286
Chest bad pain.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.655
No. No. no.

37:06.689 --> 37:08.557
You asked where Katie's
markers were

37:08.591 --> 37:11.292
and I said "check back pack".

37:13.662 --> 37:15.863
Stupid auto correct.

37:15.897 --> 37:17.665
Auto correct? What is that?

37:17.699 --> 37:21.720
Seriously? Just never mind.

37:23.438 --> 37:25.839
All right,
I'm ready for this shot.

37:27.308 --> 37:29.543
No. That's not the outfit
I told you to put on.

37:29.578 --> 37:32.144
There's been a change of plans.

37:32.179 --> 37:33.713
We thought, you know,

37:33.747 --> 37:36.783
you might wanna show off
your men's line shorts.

37:36.817 --> 37:38.184
Boom!

37:38.218 --> 37:40.386
Okay. That's real cute, you two.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.854
But this shoot
is costing me money.

37:41.889 --> 37:44.657
So let's stop wasting
everybody's time, huh?

37:44.692 --> 37:46.092
I'm not gonna wear the shorts.

37:46.126 --> 37:47.893
So if you wanna take the picture

37:47.927 --> 37:49.294
I'm gonna sit on the horse.

37:49.328 --> 37:51.196
You're really telling me
how this is going down?

37:51.230 --> 37:54.365
Oh c'mon. You have the chance
to do something provocative.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.635
To thumb your nose at what
a girl's supposed to do.

37:56.669 --> 37:58.236
What a girl's supposed
to look like.

37:58.270 --> 38:01.073
This could really set your
brand apart.

38:01.107 --> 38:03.508
Now, you think you know
my brand better than I do?

38:09.948 --> 38:13.117
Okay. You don't have to wear
the shorts...

38:13.151 --> 38:15.886
but if you don't, I'll tear up
both your contracts.

38:17.422 --> 38:20.457
Eh. Not the first sponsor
who's drop me.

38:20.492 --> 38:23.259
You know, I get what buckle bunny
fantasy you're selling here,

38:23.293 --> 38:26.295
but that's not who I am...
I'm the real deal.

38:26.330 --> 38:27.964
I'm a bronc rider.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.866
You're making a huge mistake.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.235
Amy? You're decent?

38:48.564 --> 38:50.432
- Yes.
- Hey.

38:50.466 --> 38:52.066
What's up?

38:52.100 --> 38:55.837
Oh, nothing. Just this whole
online dating thing

38:55.871 --> 38:58.906
has been a complete disaster.

38:58.940 --> 39:01.408
I need to get away
for a little while.

39:01.443 --> 39:03.243
What, like take the kids
to another beach?

39:03.277 --> 39:05.612
No. Lisa said she'd watch them.

39:05.647 --> 39:09.282
I'm going to New York,
to visit some girlfriends.

39:09.317 --> 39:12.218
Uh, you know they still have
the internet in New York, right?

39:12.253 --> 39:15.120
Yeah, and I plan on going
no where near it...

39:15.155 --> 39:16.556
at least not to meet guys.

39:16.590 --> 39:19.559
- Because of one bad date?
- Try three... Okay?

39:19.593 --> 39:20.927
And you know what they say...

39:20.961 --> 39:22.595
Three strikes, I'm out.

39:22.629 --> 39:24.964
I took my profile down
this morning.

39:24.998 --> 39:26.899
I guess, that's probably
for the best.

39:26.934 --> 39:29.068
You're the one who pushed me
to try it in the first place.

39:29.102 --> 39:31.270
I didn't think it would hurt.

39:31.304 --> 39:33.939
But Lou, the truth is,
when you meet the right guy

39:33.973 --> 39:36.475
you know, you don't need some
online dating site

39:36.509 --> 39:39.611
or a spreadsheet to tell you
he's your match.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.112
You're just gonna know.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.482
I hope so.

39:43.516 --> 39:47.118
Hey, don't go meeting
Mr. Perfect in New York.

39:58.751 --> 40:01.950
- Hey.
- Hey Cassandra.

40:02.231 --> 40:03.868
I'm glad you dropped by...

40:03.902 --> 40:05.602
I don't feel sorry for you,
okay?

40:05.636 --> 40:08.872
And for the record, Ty didn't
ask me to hang out with you.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.675
I'm sorry. It just... it came
out of the blue and I thought...

40:12.710 --> 40:14.477
I know.

40:14.512 --> 40:18.815
But people...
Well, they need friends.

40:19.969 --> 40:21.985
Wow. You're giving me quite
the complex...

40:22.019 --> 40:24.285
I didn't think I seem
that pathetic?

40:24.320 --> 40:26.822
I'm not talking about you.

40:26.856 --> 40:28.824
Look, Caleb is on the road
all the time.

40:28.858 --> 40:33.770
And every time he's away
I feel... pretty lonely.

40:34.380 --> 40:38.000
Makes me realize I've invested
so much time into my career,

40:38.034 --> 40:40.001
and now my relationship...

40:40.729 --> 40:43.504
I don't really have any friends.

40:43.539 --> 40:45.606
That sounds familiar...

40:48.274 --> 40:51.746
How about a raincheck
on that tea?

40:51.780 --> 40:54.181
I know I'm the one who
suggested that...

40:54.215 --> 40:58.351
but the thing is sitting around
and gabbing over tea...

40:58.385 --> 41:00.020
not really my thing.

41:00.054 --> 41:02.022
Yeah, me neither.

41:02.056 --> 41:04.057
Well, how about I help you
exercise your horses sometime.

41:04.091 --> 41:06.927
- I didn't think you rode?
- I'm learning...

41:06.961 --> 41:09.095
That's what happens when you
date a cowboy, you know.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.433
Whoa.

41:20.129 --> 41:23.542
- Hey.
- Tim told me what you did yesterday...

41:23.577 --> 41:26.311
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah...

41:26.345 --> 41:29.848
But the stuff I said to you
the other night... not so cool.

41:29.883 --> 41:31.415
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.017
I know you didn't mean
any of that.

41:33.052 --> 41:35.152
Besides, it was kinda good
seeing you act like that.

41:35.187 --> 41:36.888
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:36.922 --> 41:38.522
'Cause I know I never wanna be
that big of a diva

41:38.557 --> 41:40.959
when I'm a huge trick
riding star.

41:46.899 --> 41:49.933
C'mon, you gotta check out
our new jump.

41:52.770 --> 41:56.473
Okay.

41:56.507 --> 41:59.676
Okay. Come on.

42:08.952 --> 42:11.386
Whoa.

42:15.391 --> 42:18.060
Come on, let's go! Up!

42:18.095 --> 42:20.295
Nice work, Georgie!

42:24.634 --> 42:27.102
Come on.

42:28.570 --> 42:31.006
Whoa!

42:34.010 --> 42:35.710
- Wooo!
- Good boy.

42:35.745 --> 42:37.112
Wow, that was incredible.

42:37.146 --> 42:39.113
Georgie, they look amazing.

42:39.147 --> 42:40.681
Oh, they did so good.

42:40.715 --> 42:42.883
I wish we could give them some
type of reward or something.

42:42.917 --> 42:45.653
Well... You know what these
two love more than anything...

42:45.687 --> 42:47.888
And we've got a few others
that could use some exercise.

43:34.510 --> 43:35.744
On the next Heartland...

43:35.766 --> 43:37.898
Why would you want to run
for class President?

43:37.940 --> 43:40.579
Can you believe Adam
is actually running against me?

43:40.864 --> 43:42.439
No! Are you recording this?

43:42.441 --> 43:44.108
I'm documenting
all of your behaviour.

43:44.110 --> 43:44.942
This is not funny!

43:44.944 --> 43:45.976
Over a hundred views.

43:45.978 --> 43:46.976
I didn't post this!

43:46.978 --> 43:49.512
Heartland returns
February 7th on CBC.
