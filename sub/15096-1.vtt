01:40.667 --> 01:43.101
Looks deader
than a Paiute's grave.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.270
Well?

02:18.338 --> 02:20.272
That guy's awful slow
gettin' there.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.274
I feel sorry for him.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.038
Always in reach and never able
to do anything about it.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.174
I got a feeling
she could do better.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.185
You're boasting.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.380
- What'll you have? Whiskey?
- What've you got?

02:35.455 --> 02:38.618
- Whiskey.
- You ever see such a guy?

02:38.691 --> 02:42.787
All winter I've been thinking...
And all he's got is whiskey.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.955
- That's rotten, ain't it?
- Rotten.

02:45.965 --> 02:47.899
Two glasses
and a bottle.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.240
[Clears Throat]

03:10.657 --> 03:12.648
Well, what's on
you boys' mind?

03:12.725 --> 03:16.718
- Does somethin'
have to be on my mind?
- Well, there's mud in your eye.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.179
Friendly cuss, ain't he?

03:34.247 --> 03:37.512
He's just getting around
to asking if his girl is still in town.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.678
His girl? If you mean
Rose Mapen, no.

03:40.753 --> 03:44.348
She went to Frisco
the first stage out this spring.

03:44.424 --> 03:47.257
That's a lie.
She said she'd wait.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.693
It's a fact.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.560
What a town.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.967
It's my guess
the married women run her out.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.767
Oh, no tar and feathers.
No rails.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.967
They just righteously
made her feel uncomfortable.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.811
Not that she ever
did anything, but...

04:06.879 --> 04:09.541
They just couldn't get over
being afraid she might.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.976
Say, what is there
to do in this town anyway?

04:15.054 --> 04:18.113
- Unless you wanna get in line
and woo Drew's daughter.
- We don't.

04:18.190 --> 04:22.321
The only other unmarried woman
I know is 82, blind and a Paiute.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.097
That leaves you five choices.

04:26.165 --> 04:30.727
Eat, sleep, drink,
play poker or fight.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.737
Or you can shoot some pool.

04:32.805 --> 04:36.002
- I got a new table in the back room.
- That's just great.

04:45.251 --> 04:48.118
- I see Risley's still around.
- The sheriff?

04:48.187 --> 04:51.554
I thought he never got closer than Reno
except on special calls.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.993
Hey, it wouldn't be that rustling folks
we're talking about last fall?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.891
Could be.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.825
Gettin' to be a kinda
touchy subject, huh?

05:03.903 --> 05:07.202
They don't like to talk about it except
with fellows they sleep with.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.265
- Afraid they'll find out
it's somebody they know?
- Maybe.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.868
- They lose some more this spring?
- Some.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.311
- How many?
- About 600 head.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.315
They got any leads?

05:17.383 --> 05:21.410
They picked up a small-herd
trail and signs of shod horses
down the south draw.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.921
Wouldn't everybody know
if there were strangers around?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.049
Sure.
And there hadn't been any.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.059
Except you two.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.123
- That ain't funny.
- [Chuckles] Now who's touchy?

05:32.198 --> 05:34.598
You're talking about my business.
Stick to my pleasures.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.194
No offense, Carter.
I just wanted to let you know
where you two stand.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.239
- Listen...
- Take it easy, Gil.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.900
He's had five whiskeys,
and he's sore about Rose Mapen.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.069
- Keep your mouth shut
about Rose, see.
- Okay, Gil.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.875
I was just jokin'.
You can take a joke, can't you?

05:48.948 --> 05:51.075
Sure I can take a joke.
Some jokes.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.914
Lost any
over your way?

05:53.986 --> 05:56.784
No more than the winter
and the coyotes are to account for.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.381
You haven't got any ideas,
have you Farnley?

05:59.459 --> 06:01.586
Except not to have ideas.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.896
Make that clear.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.732
There are a lot of things
around here ain't clear.

06:15.808 --> 06:17.742
You still talkin'
about rustling?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.641
And strangers.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.678
<i>[Man Whistles]
Yippee!</i>

06:32.158 --> 06:34.149
Looks happy, don't he?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.457
He just needed exercise.

06:36.529 --> 06:40.295
Whenever he gets low in spirits
or confused in his mind...

06:40.366 --> 06:43.028
he doesn't feel right
until he's had a fight.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.263
It doesn't matter
whether he wins or not.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.967
He feels fine again afterwards.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.425
Ain't that guy got there yet?

07:12.498 --> 07:14.432
[Retching]

07:23.709 --> 07:27.372
Holy cow! Now I'm gonna have
to start all over again.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.281
Somebody's sure in a hurry.

07:39.492 --> 07:43.292
- Did Darby use his fist?
- [Chuckles] No, a bottle.

07:43.362 --> 07:46.661
- That's all right then.
- Hey, lay off Farnley, will ya?

07:46.732 --> 07:48.791
- Why should I?
- Because you hit him pretty hard.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.802
You made him look foolish.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.668
- Did I really get him?
- I thought you busted his neck.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.765
- No foolin'.
- [Chuckles]

07:56.843 --> 08:00.540
- Why, that no good...
- Shot right through the head, I tell ya.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.047
- Where'd it happen?
- Down in the southeast corner of the valley...

08:03.115 --> 08:05.276
- about eight miles from his ranch.
- You see him?

08:05.351 --> 08:08.377
No, sir, but Olsen did.
He found him laying in a dry wash in the sun.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.615
<i>[Man Continues]
Shot right through the head.</i>

08:10.690 --> 08:12.624
<i>- [Farnley] When?
- Well, about 2:00.</i>

08:12.692 --> 08:15.627
<i>He must've been shot a lot earlier.
They picked his horse up...</i>

08:15.695 --> 08:17.959
- clear over near the ranch road.
- Any cattle missing?

08:18.030 --> 08:20.863
They couldn't tell.
There been so many working
that range down there.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.527
- Olsen send you for us?
- No, he's in such a hurry...

08:23.603 --> 08:26.902
he just yelled at me
to go get the sheriff.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.134
Hey, Jeff, Jeff...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.443
- Rustlers?
- Looks that way.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.783
- Who was it they got?
- Kinkaid.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.083
Kinkaid? Farnley's buddy?

08:44.155 --> 08:47.853
Yeah. They've been working together
ever since they were kids.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.361
All the way from
the Panhandle toJackson's Hole.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.363
Sure, I knew him.

08:52.431 --> 08:56.800
Short, dark Irishman. Didn't say very much.
Liked to sing a lot.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.930
These fellows will go a long way
to get the guy that killed Larry Kinkaid.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.243
Lynchin'?

09:05.311 --> 09:07.245
I judge.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.980
- Got plenty of sand
but when he's mad, he's crazy!
- Wait, wait, Jeff! No rush.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.319
Even if they have got
a five-hour start.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.757
It's a good 500 miles
to the first border.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.817
Besides, there may
be a bunch of'em.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.455
It won't help Kinkaid now
to get yourself killed.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.022
That kid, Greene, got no
idea which way they went.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.091
Better wait till we
know what we're doing.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.103
We're all with you about Kinkaid.
You know that.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.867
Only, we ought to take our time
and form this posse right.

09:34.941 --> 09:38.069
So if we go, we're sure
to get what we go after.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.273
Okay. Make your posse.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.907
Somebody better get the sheriff first thing.
And Judge Tyler.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.816
Oh, what do we want with
old Tyler and his trials.

09:46.886 --> 09:50.287
Yeah, one good fast job without
no legal papers and that's all there is.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.324
Remember, this ain't
just rustling. It's murder.

09:52.391 --> 09:54.882
Wait a minute, men.
Don't let's go off half-cocked...

09:54.961 --> 09:57.054
and do something
we'll be sorry for.

09:57.129 --> 10:00.792
We want to act in a reasoned
and legitimate manner.
Not like a lawless mob.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.733
Trouble with you, Davies,
you've been storekeepin' too long.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.896
You don't see
no profit in this.

10:05.972 --> 10:09.237
If any of you fellas had offered
to buy the rope from him...

10:09.308 --> 10:11.799
If we go, you're going
with us, fat gut.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.146
Brother, I wouldn't miss it.

10:15.214 --> 10:20.208
<i>Only thing that'd bring me out
any faster would be your necktie party.</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:22.311
<i>Who knows,
maybe this is yours.</i>

10:22.388 --> 10:25.516
I'll remember that
and see you handle the rope.

10:25.591 --> 10:29.049
In Texas where I come from,
we go and get a man and string him up.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.756
That's right.
I say stretch 'em.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.925
It ain't just a rustler
we're after. It's a murderer.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.664
Larry Kinkaid, one of the finest,
most God-fearing men that ever lived...

10:38.738 --> 10:42.139
is lying out there right now
with a bullet hole in his head.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.405
If you let this go by,
there won't be nothing safe around here.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.708
Our cattle, our homes.
Not even our womenfolks.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.113
I'm with ya, Farnley.
I'm going to get me a gun and some rope.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.708
I'll be right back.
And if nobody else will do it...

10:53.786 --> 10:55.720
me and you
will do it ourselves.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.779
Count me in too!

10:57.857 --> 11:00.451
Come on, boys.
Get your guns!

11:00.526 --> 11:03.757
Listen to me, men!
Don't lose your heads like this.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.855
You mustn't do this thing.
You must not!

11:06.932 --> 11:09.127
Shut up, Grandma.
Nobody expects you to go.

11:10.970 --> 11:14.235
Don't take it so hard, Mr. Davies.
You did all you could.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.639
- Will you do me a favor, Carter?
- That depends.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.441
I'm sending Joyce here
for the sheriff and Judge Tyler.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.675
I want you to go along
and help explain.

11:23.749 --> 11:27.185
You know how Art and I stand here.
We came in at a bad time.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.687
I've got to stay here
and see if I can't...

11:29.755 --> 11:31.916
stop 'em till they realize
what they're doing.

11:31.991 --> 11:35.256
If I can make this thing regular,
that's all I ask.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.887
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, wait a minute.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.261
- Do you know Mapes?
- The one they call Butch?

11:40.332 --> 11:43.733
Yes. The sheriff's made him deputy
for times he's out of town.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.295
And we don't want Mapes.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.776
<i>Well, they said I was to be the executioner,
so I come all fixed.</i>

11:51.844 --> 11:54.404
Think I don't know
my business, huh?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.744
[Gagging]

11:59.418 --> 12:02.478
You don't look very well,
Mr. Davies.

12:02.555 --> 12:07.686
Maybe you'd better stay home
and rest up for the funeral.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.694
Maybe you could get the flowers.

12:09.762 --> 12:12.424
Boys wouldn't begrudge
a few flowers, even for a rustler.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.966
So long as he's a good dead one.
[Laughing]

12:31.884 --> 12:33.818
Get your hat and gun.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.380
I'm not going, Father.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.651
I don't wish any argument.
Do as I say.

12:39.725 --> 12:42.387
Perhaps this will do what
I've obviously failed to do...

12:42.461 --> 12:44.725
make a man of you.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.370
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

13:01.113 --> 13:04.640
Scrape your boots,
put your hat on your hand
and straighten your wig.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.014
- Well?
- Why, is the judge at home, ma'am?

13:09.088 --> 13:11.022
- Yes.
- Can we see him?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.024
You got business?

13:13.092 --> 13:16.186
No, we just
dropped in for tea.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.253
Very funny.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.821
Mr. Davies sent us, ma'am.
It's awfully important.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.562
It's not
regular office hours.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.183
That the judge's
better half?

13:39.251 --> 13:41.913
His housekeeper.
His wife's dead.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.012
Well, you can see why
there's times when...

13:44.089 --> 13:47.058
the judge don't seem to be able
to make up his own mind.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.822
<i>[Man]
Come in! Come in!</i>

13:49.895 --> 13:52.159
He says come in!

13:54.533 --> 13:57.832
Well, well, Carter, how are things out
in your neck of the woods?

13:57.903 --> 14:00.371
- All right, I guess, Judge.
- You don't appear to have been...

14:00.439 --> 14:02.464
pining away, exactly,
since last I saw you.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.772
- And what can I do for you gentlemen?
- We're here for Mr. Davies.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.246
Oh. How is my friend Davies?
Well, I trust.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.977
Yes, but could we see you alone
for a minute, Judge?

14:12.051 --> 14:15.543
- Oh, a matter of a private nature, eh?
- Yes, sir.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.146
<i>[Art] Mr. Davies said particularly
just you and Sheriff Risley.</i>

14:18.224 --> 14:21.819
- Risley ain't here. He deputized me.
- Where'd the sheriff go?

14:21.894 --> 14:24.294
Down to Kinkaid's ranch
early this morning.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.297
When will he be back?

14:26.365 --> 14:28.424
He didn't say.
Couple of days maybe.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.991
But anything you can tell him
you can tell me.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.834
Sure, we know that, Butch,
but we're here for Mr. Davies.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.204
If the judge thinks
it's your job, he'll tell you.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.209
Certainly, Mapes, certainly.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.405
All right. But if
it's a sheriff's job, call me, see.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.710
Naturally.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.512
Well, what can I do
for you gentlemen?

14:51.857 --> 14:54.792
<i>[Horses Galloping]</i>

14:54.860 --> 14:57.522
Ain't so much that Mr. Davies
don't want 'em to go.

14:57.596 --> 15:01.999
It's just he wants to make sure
a posse's sworn in to bring
him in for a fair trial.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.365
That's why we wanted
you and the sheriff to hurry.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.098
Confound it, men. The sheriff's not here.
Today of all days.

15:07.172 --> 15:09.299
You can talk to them.
They'll listen to you.

15:09.375 --> 15:13.937
No. No, no, that's not my job.
I haven't any police authority.

15:14.013 --> 15:17.847
- Where are you going, Mapes?
- There's a posse forming,
in case you hadn't heard.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.851
That's sheriff work, ain't it?

15:19.919 --> 15:23.218
That's no posse. That's
a lawless, lynching mob.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.314
It'll be a posse
when I get there.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.359
I'm gonna deputize
them all proper.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.385
But you can't do that.
Risley's the only one
empowered to deputize.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.130
<i>[Sizzles]</i>

15:39.071 --> 15:41.471
Should we tell Davies
you're coming, Judge?

15:41.540 --> 15:44.634
Yes. Yes, of course.
I suppose I'll have to.

15:44.710 --> 15:48.077
But doggone it, this is
the sheriff's job. Not mine.

15:55.054 --> 16:00.420
<i>[Indistinct Whispering]</i>

16:05.126 --> 16:07.060
Coming along, Sparks?

16:08.963 --> 16:11.796
No, sir, Mr. Smith.
I don't guess so.

16:11.866 --> 16:13.857
Oh, you better
come along, Sparks.

16:13.935 --> 16:17.962
Ain't every day we have a hanging
in a town as dead as this one.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.209
You won't have to do nothin'.

16:22.276 --> 16:24.608
All the real work's signed up.

16:28.483 --> 16:32.146
I just thought we ought
to have a reverend along...

16:32.220 --> 16:34.211
'cause there's gonna be
some prayin' done.

16:36.424 --> 16:39.291
Maybe you're right, Mr. Smith.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.228
Maybe somebody ought to go along
that feels the way I do.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.356
<i>[Smith]
Davies'll loan you his Bible...</i>

16:45.433 --> 16:48.561
<i>so all the reading will be
done right at the burial.</i>

16:48.636 --> 16:52.231
Thank you, sir.
But I knows my text without the book.

16:52.306 --> 16:54.570
They're kidding you, Sparks.

16:54.642 --> 16:58.703
I know, sir.
But maybe Mr. Smith's accidently right.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.714
Maybe I ought to go along.

17:00.782 --> 17:02.943
There's an old horse
in my shed you can use.

17:03.017 --> 17:06.544
Thank you, sir.
I'll go and fetch it.

17:06.621 --> 17:09.589
Ya-haw!
Here comes Ma!

17:09.656 --> 17:11.818
- [Cheering]
- Come on! We're ready to go.

17:11.893 --> 17:14.384
Hiya, boys!

17:14.462 --> 17:16.396
[Indistinct]

17:16.464 --> 17:19.262
Whoa. Well, boys,
what are we waitin' for now?

17:19.333 --> 17:22.496
Judge Tyler.
Davies asked him to come over.

17:24.439 --> 17:26.805
[Breathing Heavily]

17:26.874 --> 17:28.967
I understand
how it is, men.

17:29.043 --> 17:34.174
My old friend Larry Kinkaid,
one of the finest and noblest...

17:34.248 --> 17:36.341
Cut the stumpin', Tyler.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.408
All we want
is your blessing.

17:38.486 --> 17:44.049
Of course you can't flinch from what
you believe to be your duty.

17:44.125 --> 17:47.959
But certainly,
you don't want to act hastily...

17:48.029 --> 17:52.659
in the same spirit of lawlessness
that begot this foul crime.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.724
Ah, Judge, before you get
ready to act...

17:54.802 --> 17:57.134
them rustlers will be
clear down over the Rio.

17:57.205 --> 18:01.107
One more word, Smith, and I'll have you up
for impeding the course of justice.

18:01.175 --> 18:03.837
Judge, you can't impede
what don't move anyway.

18:03.911 --> 18:06.004
[Laughing]

18:06.080 --> 18:10.312
And you, Jenny Grier, a woman...

18:10.384 --> 18:12.443
to lend yourself to this.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.511
- Ha!
- [Laughing]

18:14.589 --> 18:17.217
Now, listen.
Listen, men.

18:17.291 --> 18:21.523
I've just found out that Sheriff Risley's
already down at Kinkaid's.

18:21.596 --> 18:24.258
- That right, Judge?
- Yes. He's been there all morning.

18:24.332 --> 18:26.391
Yes. So you see,
probably everything's...

18:26.467 --> 18:29.231
being attended to
right now, legally.

18:29.303 --> 18:33.501
All you'll get out of it
is a long, hard ride.

18:33.574 --> 18:36.270
It'll be dark before long
and mighty cold.

18:36.344 --> 18:38.335
My advice is to come inside,
Have a drink...

18:38.412 --> 18:40.505
and let's wait till
we hear from the sheriff.

18:40.581 --> 18:44.312
Drinks on the house. But only one round.
I'm not filling any bucket bellies.

18:44.385 --> 18:47.843
- I'll make it two.
- Any of you fellas wanna
stay in town, I can take six...

18:47.922 --> 18:50.015
<i>if you don't mind
sleeping doubles.</i>

18:50.091 --> 18:53.686
<i>[Davies] It's not like you were giving up, boys.
It's just good sense.</i>

18:55.763 --> 18:57.697
<i>[Judge]
Farnley, come back!</i>

18:57.765 --> 18:59.858
I'm not asking you!
I'm telling you!

19:07.608 --> 19:11.738
You don't have to worry, Jeff.
This business is going to be taken care of.

19:11.812 --> 19:16.579
Yeah, and I know who's
gonna take care of it. Me.

19:16.651 --> 19:21.918
I tell you now, whoever shot
Larry Kinkaid ain't coming
back here for you to...

19:21.989 --> 19:25.356
fuddle with your lawyers' tricks
for six months.

19:25.426 --> 19:28.657
Then be let off because Davies,
or some other whining old woman...

19:28.729 --> 19:32.165
claim he ain't bad at heart.

19:32.233 --> 19:36.135
Kinkaid didn't have six months
to decide if he wanted to die.

19:36.204 --> 19:38.138
<i>Disbanding, men?</i>

19:38.206 --> 19:40.697
<i>[Ma] Davies has just about
convinced us, Major Tetley.</i>

19:40.775 --> 19:43.141
- Of what, Mr. Davies?
- Why, of... of...

19:43.211 --> 19:45.475
I take it you were acting
on the assumption...

19:45.546 --> 19:47.912
- the raiders left for the south draw.
- Yes, of course.

19:47.982 --> 19:49.916
They didn't.

19:49.984 --> 19:52.475
- They went east by Bridger's Pass.
- That's through the mountains?

19:52.553 --> 19:55.078
<i>[Tetley] Over the old stage road
to Pike's Hole.</i>

19:55.156 --> 19:57.590
<i>- But that's 8,000 feet up.
- [Tetley] Approximately.</i>

19:57.658 --> 19:59.387
They'd be crazy
to go that way.

19:59.460 --> 20:03.260
Not so crazy perhaps, Mr. Davies,
knowing how crazy it would look to us.

20:03.331 --> 20:05.424
How come
you're so sure, Tetley?

20:05.499 --> 20:08.263
Pancho saw them.
He was coming back from Pike's.

20:08.336 --> 20:12.602
<i>- Had trouble getting by them in the pass.
- Sí. He not see me, I think.</i>

20:12.673 --> 20:16.939
So, he was headed down the hollow
and I drive my horse out of the way.

20:17.011 --> 20:20.913
At first I think I say hello.
And then I think it's funny
how to drive the cattle then.

20:20.982 --> 20:23.109
- Cattle?
- Sure.

20:23.184 --> 20:25.914
- Why do you think I had
to get out of his road?
- Go on.

20:25.987 --> 20:29.286
When I see what mark those cattle had,
I be very, very quiet.

20:29.357 --> 20:33.521
<i>- [Mapes] What kind of marks?
- Oh, in the throat.
Three little whatchamacallem.</i>

20:33.594 --> 20:35.858
That's Kinkaid's mark.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.490
- The dirty rats!
- [Clamoring]

20:40.368 --> 20:41.926
- How many were there?
- Forty head.

20:42.003 --> 20:43.265
- I mean rustlers.
- Three.

20:43.337 --> 20:46.204
Why were you so long
in bringing us this word, Major?

20:46.274 --> 20:51.735
I knew my son would want to go along.
He was out on the range.

20:53.981 --> 20:56.381
Major Tetley,
you mustn't let this be a lynching.

20:56.450 --> 20:58.384
It's scarcely
what I choose, Davies.

20:58.452 --> 21:01.649
Promise me you'll bring them in
for a fair trial.

21:01.722 --> 21:04.054
I promise that I'll
abide by the majority will.

21:04.125 --> 21:07.390
Tetley, you know what's
legal in this case as well as I do.

21:07.461 --> 21:09.395
<i>[Judge]
All we ask is a posse...</i>

21:09.463 --> 21:12.023
<i>to act under a properly constituted
officer of the law.</i>

21:12.099 --> 21:15.034
That's where I come in.
Risley made me a deputy.

21:15.102 --> 21:17.866
In that case, Mr. Mapes,
suppose you deputize the rest of us?

21:17.938 --> 21:20.964
That's not legal.
No deputy has the right to deputize.

21:21.042 --> 21:24.409
- How 'bout it, boys?
- Suits me, Butch. Go ahead and pray.

21:24.478 --> 21:26.742
Mapes, you're
violating the law.

21:27.815 --> 21:29.749
Raise your right hands.

21:41.028 --> 21:44.623
I hereby solemnly swear that
I am duly sworn in as a deputy...

21:44.699 --> 21:46.997
in the case of the murder
of Larry Kinkaid.

21:47.068 --> 21:50.504
<i>And am willing to abide by
the decisions of the majority.
So help me God.</i>

21:50.571 --> 21:53.438
- Say "I do".
- [All] I do.

21:57.712 --> 22:01.443
Tetley, you bring those men in alive.
Or as I'm justice of this county...

22:01.515 --> 22:04.814
you'll pay for it and every jack man
in your gang!

22:04.885 --> 22:07.752
- Tetley!
- You coming?

22:07.822 --> 22:10.313
Get my horse.
I'm going with them.

22:10.391 --> 22:13.360
Then get down to Kinkaid's.
Get the sheriff.

23:46.954 --> 23:49.821
We'll stop here for a minute, gentlemen,
and breathe our horses.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.155
Winder, take one man with you,
go up to the top of that ridge...

23:53.227 --> 23:55.286
and see what you can see.

24:00.968 --> 24:03.163
Doin' this in the middle
of the night's crazy.

24:03.237 --> 24:05.364
I thought
you liked excitement.

24:05.439 --> 24:08.806
I got nothin' particular against
hangin' a murdering rustler.

24:08.876 --> 24:11.538
It's just, I don't
like doing it in the dark.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.445
There's always some crazy fool
to lose his head...

24:15.516 --> 24:18.007
- and start hangin' everybody in sight.
- Us?

24:18.085 --> 24:21.145
- Funnier things have happened.
- Well, we didn't have to come.

24:21.222 --> 24:23.713
It'd looked kind of funny
if we hadn't, wouldn't it?

24:23.791 --> 24:25.725
Besides, I like
to pick my own bosses.

24:25.793 --> 24:28.557
Whether we picked them
or not, we sure got 'em.

24:28.629 --> 24:34.158
That's what I don't like.
That Smith and Bartlett
shootin' off their mouths.

24:34.235 --> 24:37.762
Farnley...
and that renegade Tetley.

24:37.838 --> 24:40.932
Struttin' around his uniform
pretending he's so much.

24:41.008 --> 24:43.738
He never even saw the South
till after the war.

24:43.811 --> 24:48.475
Then only long enough
to marry that kid's mother
and get run out by her folks.

24:48.549 --> 24:51.382
Figured there was something
fishy about him dressing up like that.

24:51.452 --> 24:54.888
Sure. Why do you suppose
he'd be living in this neck of the woods...

24:54.955 --> 24:56.946
if he didn't have
something to hide.

25:04.765 --> 25:08.531
Let's get out of here before
we all freeze to death.
Or else give it up.

25:08.602 --> 25:12.595
We'd be the laughingstock of the country
if we went home on account of cold.

25:12.673 --> 25:14.607
<i>That's right.
But I'm telling you...</i>

25:14.675 --> 25:17.872
this rope's gonna have to be thawed out
before it's fit to use.

25:17.945 --> 25:20.436
Mind if I come in
a little closer, Mr. Carter?

25:20.514 --> 25:24.245
No, come on. I'm finding it
kind of lonesome myself.

25:24.318 --> 25:27.754
- Powerful cold tonight, ain't it?
- I got a blanket if you want it.

25:27.821 --> 25:30.551
No. Thank you
just the same, Mr. Carter.

25:30.624 --> 25:33.320
But it takes all my hands
to stay on this old horse.

25:33.394 --> 25:36.090
- Better have a couple of shots.
- I never use it.

25:37.865 --> 25:40.732
I sure wish we was well
out of this here business.

25:40.801 --> 25:43.599
Ah, it's a way
of spending time.

25:43.671 --> 25:47.402
It's man taking on himself
the vengeance of the Lord.

25:47.474 --> 25:49.738
[Snickers]

25:49.810 --> 25:52.870
You think the Lord cares much about
what's happening up here tonight?

25:52.947 --> 25:55.108
<i>He marks the sparrow's fall.</i>

25:57.651 --> 26:00.882
I seen my own brother
lynched, Mr. Carter.

26:00.955 --> 26:03.423
I was nothin'
but a little fella.

26:03.490 --> 26:07.153
But sometimes now,
I wakes up dreamin' about it.

26:08.295 --> 26:11.093
Had he done what they...
picked him up for?

26:11.165 --> 26:14.657
I don't know. Nobody never
did know for sure.

26:17.538 --> 26:20.029
[Inhales, Exhales Slowly]

26:20.107 --> 26:23.634
Well, a couple of shots more whiskey
can't do my soul any harm.

26:30.551 --> 26:32.951
Darby sure sells rotten liquor.

26:35.022 --> 26:38.082
Warms you up though.

26:38.158 --> 26:40.956
Feels like fire
creepin' in the short grass.

26:43.030 --> 26:45.521
I guess I'll just let her
spread a little while.

26:45.599 --> 26:49.194
<i>[Farnley] Put out that light, you fool.
You wanna give us away?</i>

26:49.269 --> 26:51.760
Who to?

26:51.839 --> 26:53.864
Chuck that butt
or I'll plug you.

26:53.941 --> 26:57.433
Start something.
For every hole you make, I'll make two.

27:05.619 --> 27:09.521
Looks like you're gonna have
a lot of shootin' to do, Mr. Farnley.

27:14.294 --> 27:16.592
Listen, something's coming!

27:20.067 --> 27:24.401
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa.

27:26.807 --> 27:29.173
Hyah! Hyah, hyah, hyah!

27:38.452 --> 27:41.182
Fools! Stop him! Stop it!

27:48.529 --> 27:50.463
- What's the matter, Art?
- Shot.

27:50.531 --> 27:52.465
- Where?
- Left shoulder.

28:03.944 --> 28:06.435
You fool, you must be drunk.
Nobody but a drunken idiot...

28:06.513 --> 28:09.414
- would drive down a grade
in the dark like that.
- I thought it was a stickup.

28:09.483 --> 28:11.610
If those horses weren't
a sight smarter than you...

28:11.685 --> 28:15.052
that coach would be at the bottom
of the canyon right now.

28:25.065 --> 28:26.999
<i>[Ma]
Rose Mapen!</i>

28:31.638 --> 28:33.663
Hello, everybody.

28:35.709 --> 28:39.201
This is my husband,
Mr. Swanson of San Francisco.

28:39.279 --> 28:42.771
And, uh, my sister-in-law,
Miss Swanson.

28:42.850 --> 28:46.183
- Did you just get married, Rose?
- Just today.

28:46.253 --> 28:48.517
[Laughs]
No wonder you were in such a hurry.

28:48.589 --> 28:50.523
<i>[Ma Cackling]</i>

28:50.591 --> 28:54.322
My name is Tetley, sir.
I can understand why
Miss Rose is in a hurry...

28:54.394 --> 28:57.386
to show the other ladies what can be done
in the way of matrimony.

28:57.464 --> 29:01.093
- Thank you, sir.
- Say, what's everybody doing
up here this time of night?

29:01.168 --> 29:03.159
[Clears Throat]
Why, uh...

29:16.016 --> 29:17.950
Art's shot.

[Clamoring]

[Chattering Continues]

29:32.866 --> 29:35.528
<i>- Gee, I'm sorry.
- [Art] You couldn't tell.</i>

29:35.602 --> 29:38.162
You hadn't ought to come
barging out like that.

29:38.238 --> 29:42.334
In the dark especially.
I couldn't tell who it was.
Everybody yelling like that.

29:42.409 --> 29:44.468
Aw, shut up!

29:51.451 --> 29:54.318
Here. I'm good
at this sort of thing.

29:54.388 --> 29:57.289
<i>[Art] Look, do women
have to watch this?</i>

30:11.305 --> 30:13.569
<i>[Art Screams]</i>

30:18.812 --> 30:22.213
<i>[Davies] There's room
in the stagecoach for you, Art.</i>

30:22.282 --> 30:26.184
Yeah, I better get you on back to Darby's
and get some hot food into you.

30:26.253 --> 30:29.780
<i>- I'm all right.
- Come on. Be a good boy.
Don't be stubborn.</i>

30:29.857 --> 30:32.485
- Yeah, don't be a fool.
- Mind your own business!

30:38.832 --> 30:41.027
<i>Bring his horse over,
will ya?</i>

30:53.747 --> 30:58.241
- She's his wife now and kind of new.
- Yeah, looks that way, don't it?

31:13.934 --> 31:16.300
I take it you've had
the privilege of knowing...

31:16.370 --> 31:19.771
- Miss Mapen before she became my wife.
- That's right.

31:19.840 --> 31:24.243
And possibly you imagined at the time
there was some understanding between you?

31:25.479 --> 31:28.004
Yeah, sure.

31:28.081 --> 31:31.084
- My wife is a very impulsive woman.
- That's what I'm saying.

31:31.217 --> 31:33.481
Needless to say,
I'm pleased to regard...

31:33.553 --> 31:36.420
any friend of my wife's
a friend of my own.

31:36.489 --> 31:40.152
However, I don't need to remind you that
the pleasure of such an acquaintance...

31:40.226 --> 31:42.194
depends upon the recognition
by all parties...

31:42.261 --> 31:44.923
of the fact that
Miss Mapen is now my wife.

31:44.997 --> 31:46.931
She must be given
a little time...

31:46.999 --> 31:49.365
to become accustomed to her
new responsibilities.

31:49.435 --> 31:53.462
As yet, I must confess that I'm jealous
of her least attention.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.473
You'll forgive me, I know.

31:55.541 --> 32:01.036
A bridegroom is prone
to be overly susceptible for a time.

32:01.114 --> 32:05.175
Later, when we've had time
to get accustomed to our new relations...

32:05.251 --> 32:09.779
<i>I shall be delighted to welcome you
and others of my wife's friends...</i>

32:09.856 --> 32:13.087
to our home
in San Francisco.

32:13.159 --> 32:15.821
If it is still her desire.

32:16.796 --> 32:18.730
Until then...

32:23.836 --> 32:26.703
Why, that superior little...

32:33.446 --> 32:37.143
Looks like Rose's took
onto herself a lot of trouble.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.610
Giddap! Giddap!

32:47.927 --> 32:50.020
<i>[Gunshot In Distance]</i>

32:50.096 --> 32:52.291
<i>[Cattle Mooing]</i>

33:13.085 --> 33:15.417
- Where are we?
- The Ox-Bow.

33:15.488 --> 33:18.013
There they are, gentlemen.

33:20.459 --> 33:24.862
I suggest we avoid any shooting
or rough work until they've had
a chance to tell it their way.

33:24.931 --> 33:26.956
Mr. Mapes and I
will do the talking.

33:27.033 --> 33:30.901
- The one that got Kinkaid
is mine. Don't forget that.
- He's yours when we're sure.

33:30.970 --> 33:33.871
<i>[Tetley] Ten men will go with Mrs. Grier
and come up from behind.</i>

33:33.940 --> 33:38.138
<i>Bartlett, take six men and work through
those woods in back of the cabin.</i>

33:38.211 --> 33:41.908
Gerald, you and Farnley
and the rest will go with me.

33:41.981 --> 33:43.915
Would you
like a gun, Mr. Davies?

33:43.983 --> 33:47.214
- No, thank you.
- Sparks?

33:47.286 --> 33:50.551
Thank you.
No, sir, Major Tetley.

33:50.623 --> 33:53.114
As you choose.

35:49.475 --> 35:52.774
- Get up!
- Drop it!

35:56.916 --> 35:59.077
Now put up your hands.

36:00.653 --> 36:02.587
<i>No sabe.</i>

36:02.655 --> 36:05.180
It's all right, brother.
You will.

36:20.239 --> 36:22.207
[Yawning]

36:23.476 --> 36:26.104
[Groans]

36:31.417 --> 36:34.648
Take it easy, mister.
Stay where you are and put your hands up.

36:38.791 --> 36:41.225
Gerald,
collect their guns.

36:41.293 --> 36:45.457
- What do you want?
- Shut up! We'll tell you
when we want you to talk.

36:45.531 --> 36:49.092
This ain't no stickup, brother.
This is a posse if that means anything to you.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.227
But we haven't done anything.

36:55.074 --> 36:57.065
Gerald!

37:26.939 --> 37:28.930
Get 'em up!

37:59.238 --> 38:01.172
<i>[Tetley]
Tie them up!</i>

38:01.240 --> 38:03.834
- Get in...
- All right, get in there.

38:06.946 --> 38:09.710
Well, at least you might tell us what
we're being held for.

38:09.782 --> 38:12.376
<i>- I'd rather you told us.
- [Horses Approaching]</i>

38:29.902 --> 38:32.700
Well, we must be pretty important.
Or else awfully dangerous.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.705
It ain't that
you're so dangerous.

38:34.773 --> 38:38.231
It's just that most of the men
ain't never seen a real triple hangin'.

38:38.310 --> 38:40.403
A hangin'?
What have we done?

38:42.915 --> 38:45.440
Aren't you even gonna tell us
what we're accused of?

38:45.518 --> 38:47.952
- Rustlin'. Ever hear of it?
- Rustlin'?

38:48.020 --> 38:50.648
And murder.

38:53.058 --> 38:55.026
Murder?

38:56.028 --> 39:00.158
Oh, Mr. Martin,
what did we do?

39:00.232 --> 39:02.257
It's all right, Dad.
There's some mistake.

39:08.373 --> 39:10.807
Remember me?

39:11.943 --> 39:14.878
- [Grunts]
- He's talkin' to ya, mister.

39:14.946 --> 39:17.380
<i>- No sabe.
- He don't speak English.</i>

39:17.448 --> 39:19.848
- I got a different notion.
- I'll make him talk.

39:19.917 --> 39:24.513
<i>- That'll do, Farnley!
- Listen, your wife had enough
of you playin' God Almighty.</i>

39:24.589 --> 39:27.683
Who picked you
for this job anyhow?

39:27.759 --> 39:30.421
We got him. I say let's swing him before
we all freeze to death!

39:30.495 --> 39:32.588
You cold? Here's a fire.
Warm yourself.

39:32.663 --> 39:34.961
And I'll advise you
to control your tongue too.

39:35.033 --> 39:37.001
We'll get along better.

39:37.068 --> 39:39.730
- Who's boss of this outfit?
- I am.

39:39.871 --> 39:42.465
- And your name?
- Donald Martin.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.474
- Where you from?
- Pike's Hole.

39:44.542 --> 39:47.534
<i>- That's a lie!
- This gentleman's from Pike's Hole.</i>

39:47.612 --> 39:49.546
Would you like
to change your story?

39:49.614 --> 39:53.448
I just moved in three days ago.
I'm on Dave Baker's place up on the north end.

39:53.518 --> 39:56.919
Dave Baker moved out four years ago,
and the place is a wreck.

39:56.988 --> 40:00.480
The barns are all fallin' down
and the sagebrush is stickin' up
through the porch.

40:00.558 --> 40:03.789
Well, I bought the place from him for $4,000
in Los Angeles last month.

40:03.861 --> 40:07.763
- [Laughs] Then, mister, you was robbed.
- Well, that may be.

40:07.832 --> 40:11.791
But surely it's not so far to Pike's Hole
you can't go over there and find out.

40:11.869 --> 40:14.064
My wife's there right now...

40:14.138 --> 40:19.542
- and my two kids.
- That's really too bad, just too bad.

40:19.610 --> 40:22.511
Even in this godforsaken country,
I've got a right to a trial!

40:22.580 --> 40:25.413
You're getting a trial with 28
of the only kind of judges...

40:25.483 --> 40:29.214
murderers and rustlers get in what you call
this "godforsaken country".

40:29.287 --> 40:32.017
So far, the jury
don't like your story.

40:32.090 --> 40:34.854
Well, I'm not gonna say another word
without a proper hearing.

40:34.926 --> 40:38.191
<i>[Ma] Suit yourself.
But this is all the hearing
you're likely to get...</i>

40:38.262 --> 40:40.196
<i>short of the LastJudgment.</i>

40:40.264 --> 40:42.664
Have you any cattle
up here with you?

40:42.733 --> 40:46.999
<i>Hey, Mr. Martin?</i>

40:49.073 --> 40:51.541
[Gagging]

40:51.609 --> 40:54.009
[Laughs]

40:54.078 --> 40:56.911
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

41:00.251 --> 41:03.550
- Yes, I have.
- How many?

41:03.621 --> 41:05.987
- Fifty head.
- Where did you get 'em?

41:06.057 --> 41:08.719
From Mr. Kinkaid.

41:08.793 --> 41:11.091
That's just
what we figured, son.

41:11.162 --> 41:13.687
I'm no rustler though.
I didn't steal 'em!

41:13.764 --> 41:16.528
I bought 'em
and paid hard cash for them.

41:16.601 --> 41:18.933
My own cattle were so bad,
I didn't want to risk bringin' 'em up.

41:19.003 --> 41:22.734
So I sold them out at Salinas,
and I had to stock up again.

41:30.515 --> 41:33.643
Well, you can wait can't ya,
till you can see Kinkaid?

41:33.718 --> 41:36.346
- Or ask about me over at Pike's Hole.
- That's a good one.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.980
He's wants us to wait
and ask Larry Kinkaid.

41:39.056 --> 41:41.320
<i>Gotta hand it to ya, Martin.
You're a cool one all right.</i>

41:41.392 --> 41:44.088
You know as well as we do,
Kinkaid can't tell us anything.

41:44.162 --> 41:47.290
- He's dead.
- Dead?

41:48.366 --> 41:50.698
<i>What do you think
we're up here for?</i>

41:50.768 --> 41:52.929
Well, how should I know?
He was all right yesterday afternoon.

41:53.004 --> 41:56.701
Listen. Why don't you stop
this farce and take us in!

41:56.774 --> 41:59.743
'Cause the law's slow and careless
around here sometimes.

41:59.810 --> 42:02.574
We're here to see
it's speeded up.

42:03.648 --> 42:05.707
- Who sent you up here?
- The sheriff.

42:05.783 --> 42:08.377
<i>- [Gil] That ain't true!
- [Smith] Let's don't get started again.</i>

42:08.452 --> 42:11.182
<i>- It's gettin'late.
- The sheriff didn't even know we were comin'.</i>

42:11.255 --> 42:14.156
I beg your pardon.
I should have said the deputy sheriff.

42:14.225 --> 42:17.956
Listen, men.
I'm not trying to obstruct justice...

42:18.029 --> 42:21.055
but just as this young man says,
this is a farce.

42:21.132 --> 42:23.828
And it'll be murder
if you carry it through.

42:23.901 --> 42:27.667
All he's asking is what every man's
entitled to... a fair trial.

42:27.738 --> 42:30.798
<i>You say you're innocent, Martin,
and I, for one, believe you.</i>

42:30.875 --> 42:33.002
<i>[Ma] Then I guess you're
the only one, Arthur.</i>

42:33.077 --> 42:35.341
<i>If there's anyjustice
in your proceedings, Tetley...</i>

42:35.413 --> 42:37.347
it will only be
after a confession.

42:37.415 --> 42:39.679
And they haven't confessed.
They say they're innocent...

42:39.750 --> 42:41.911
- and you haven't proved they're not!
- Shut up!

42:41.986 --> 42:44.318
<i>- [Punch Landing]
- Have you a bill of sale for those cattle?</i>

42:44.388 --> 42:48.085
Well, no, I haven't.
But Mr. Kinkaid said it would be all right.

42:48.159 --> 42:51.185
I couldn't find him at the house.
He was out on the range!

42:51.262 --> 42:54.197
He didn't have a bill of sale with him.
He said he'd mail it to me.

42:54.265 --> 42:56.893
Moore. How long you been
ridin' with Kinkaid?

42:56.968 --> 43:00.369
- Six years.
- Ever know him sell cattle
without a bill of sale?

43:00.438 --> 43:03.271
N-N-No.
Can't say that I ever did.

43:03.341 --> 43:07.175
[Sniffles] Course, I can't remember
every head he sold in six years.

43:07.245 --> 43:10.408
- But it's customary for him
to give a bill of sale?
- Y-Yep.

43:10.481 --> 43:13.780
Ever know him to sell
cattle after spring roundup,
this or any other year?

43:13.851 --> 43:18.754
<i>I can answer that.
I heard him say myself
just a couple of days ago...</i>

43:18.823 --> 43:22.224
- he wouldn't sell a head
to nobody this spring.
- Well?

43:24.262 --> 43:27.959
I know it looks bad giving a dead man
for a witness, but it's the truth.

43:28.032 --> 43:31.490
- You don't believe me.
- Would you in my place?

43:31.569 --> 43:35.164
I'd do a lot of finding out, before
hanging men who might be innocent.

43:35.239 --> 43:37.833
If it were only rustlin'
maybe, but... but murder?

43:37.908 --> 43:39.842
No.

43:45.950 --> 43:49.147
<i>[Ma] What are you tryin'to do,
play cat and mouse with 'em?</i>

43:49.220 --> 43:51.848
I would prefer
a confession, Martin.

43:51.922 --> 43:53.913
[Sobs]

43:57.261 --> 43:59.957
If you've got any doubts,
I say call off this party.

44:00.031 --> 44:02.192
Take 'em back toJudge
like Davies wants.

44:02.266 --> 44:04.894
This is only slightly any of your business,
my friend. Remember that.

44:04.969 --> 44:07.665
Hangin's any man's business
that's around!

44:07.738 --> 44:10.400
If your stomach for justice
is coolin', Carter...

44:10.474 --> 44:13.739
I'd advise you to leave now
before we proceed any further.

44:13.811 --> 44:16.211
Otherwise, your interruptions are gonna
become very tiresome.

44:16.280 --> 44:19.249
- I still don't like it!
Hangin' murderers is one thing,
- Take it easy.

44:19.317 --> 44:21.308
But to keep guys
you don't know for sure did it...

44:21.385 --> 44:23.319
standin' around sweatin'
while you shoot your mouth off...

44:23.387 --> 44:26.515
- that's another.
- Take it easy. This ain't our picnic.

44:26.590 --> 44:29.855
If you keep on buttin' in,
I got a hunch it might be.

44:29.927 --> 44:32.122
You called this old man, "Dad".
Is he your father?

44:32.196 --> 44:35.893
- No.
- Speak up, man.
You're taking it like a woman.

44:35.966 --> 44:39.732
Keep your chin up.
You can only die once, son.

44:39.804 --> 44:42.238
- No. He works for me.
- Uh... U-Uh...

44:42.306 --> 44:45.571
- I didn't do it. I ain't even got a gun.
- Then who did?

44:45.643 --> 44:47.975
Uh, uh...

44:50.314 --> 44:53.147
The Mexican did it.
He told me so.

44:53.217 --> 44:55.151
Eh, no...

44:55.219 --> 44:58.120
Uh,
I-I saw him do it.

44:58.189 --> 45:00.453
Juan couldn't have done anything.
I was with him all the time.

45:00.524 --> 45:02.458
Uh, yes, he did,
Mr. Martin.

45:02.526 --> 45:05.586
He was asleep,
and he didn't mean to tell me.

45:05.663 --> 45:08.393
But I was awake, and...

45:08.466 --> 45:11.833
I-I heard him talkin' about it.

45:11.902 --> 45:14.928
The old man's feeble-minded.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

45:15.005 --> 45:17.371
He invents things.

45:17.441 --> 45:19.932
Well, if you've got to go through
with this filthy comedy...

45:20.010 --> 45:23.104
- you can at least
let him alone, can't ya?
- Shut up!

45:23.180 --> 45:25.114
<i>Lay off, Mapes!</i>

45:25.182 --> 45:28.447
First, he won't talk.
Now he talks too much.

45:31.122 --> 45:34.250
What's his name?

45:34.325 --> 45:36.259
Alva Hardwick.

45:36.327 --> 45:38.852
- And the other?
- Juan Martinez.

45:38.929 --> 45:41.693
<i>No, it ain't.</i>

45:41.766 --> 45:45.065
Still don't remember me, eh?

45:45.136 --> 45:47.127
I'm talkin' to you, mister.

45:48.472 --> 45:50.770
<i>- No sabe.
- The devil you don't.</i>

45:50.841 --> 45:54.436
Your name's Francisco Morez,
and the vigilantes would
like to get ahold of you.

45:54.512 --> 45:56.605
He was a gambler.
They want him for murder.

45:56.680 --> 45:59.547
- How about that?
- I don't know.

45:59.617 --> 46:01.949
<i>Stick together nice,
don't they?</i>

46:02.019 --> 46:04.852
Why do you keep asking me

That's why you kept them
