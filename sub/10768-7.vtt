14:16.930 --> 14:18.790
I'm not mad.

14:19.690 --> 14:21.130
You're not?

14:22.030 --> 14:24.460
And you thought
he was gonna be mad.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.900
Well, you transferred out,
you'll transfer back.

14:28.070 --> 14:29.800
Tomorrow when I wake up...

14:29.970 --> 14:35.100
...Ashley will be back in Bel-Air Academy
and maybe Will won't even be here.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.140
Daddy, I'm not going back.

14:40.420 --> 14:41.910
Now I'm mad.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.780
- You knew about this.
ASHLEY: No.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.120
Will didn't do anything wrong.

14:47.290 --> 14:50.450
- That's right, you tell him.
- If anything, I should thank Will.

14:50.630 --> 14:54.150
- He's the whole reason I transferred.
- Whoa, whoa.

14:54.330 --> 14:57.320
Pull it back, baby. Pull it back.

14:59.470 --> 15:02.400
Like I'm doing. Pull it back.

15:02.740 --> 15:06.940
Daddy, Will made me realize
how limited my life has been.

15:07.110 --> 15:09.700
I wanna be with real people
with real concerns.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.310
Oh, and people in Bel-Air
don't have real concerns?

15:12.480 --> 15:16.350
- It's pronounced Porsche.
HILARY: Porsche.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.320
- Porsche.
- Porsche.

15:22.660 --> 15:26.560
- Ashley, honey, you lied to us.
- I knew you'd say no.

15:26.730 --> 15:30.530
But, honey, we just want you
to have the best education possible.

15:30.700 --> 15:35.570
Mom, Bel-Air Academy doesn't equal better.
You and Dad both went to public schools.

15:35.870 --> 15:37.810
Whoa, good point, Ash.

15:42.610 --> 15:45.480
- Can't we at least discuss this?
- I believe we just did.

15:45.650 --> 15:49.670
- San Tropez.
- San Tropez.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.660
Will, I took your advice and reached out
to our brothers and sisters. Heh.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.660
Look at this.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.560
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

16:04.730 --> 16:07.130
<i>Hello and welcome to Hilary.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:08.930
<i>As an African American woman...</i>

16:09.100 --> 16:12.300
<i>...I'd like to dedicate this show
to all my sisters.</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:25.080
<i>Her jewelry is from the Ivory Coast...</i>

16:25.250 --> 16:29.020
<i>...and her weave is from

<i>Our next model is Buffie.</i>

16:39.130 --> 16:42.130
Um, Hil, I just... I...
I really wanna commend...

16:42.300 --> 16:45.470
...your attempt to reach out
to your African American viewers...

16:45.640 --> 16:48.870
- ... but you forgot one thing.
- What?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.740
African Americans.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.610
Oh.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.480
Carlton, she went to private school,
didn't she?

16:59.650 --> 17:01.050
Touché.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.920
But there's a bigger issue here.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.290
People talk.

17:04.460 --> 17:07.020
What if an admissions officer
at Princeton found out...

17:07.200 --> 17:11.359
...my sister was going to public school?
I mean, my God.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.960
ASHLEY:
Daddy, I'd like you to meet someone.

17:17.069 --> 17:21.480
This is Miss Sharpe. She's my
homeroom teacher at Morris High.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.640
Miss Sharpe, this is my father.
The real one.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.210
Thanks, Ashley.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.840
- Pleased to meet you.
- Same here.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.110
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thank you.

17:31.290 --> 17:34.480
I thought if we met I could
allay any concerns you might have.

17:34.660 --> 17:35.710
Well, Miss Sharpe...

17:35.890 --> 17:39.020
...you made quite an impression
upon my daughter.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.720
But, with all due respect,
I am thoroughly satisfied...

17:41.900 --> 17:44.690
...with the education
Ashley is receiving at Bel-Air Academy.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.800
Perhaps you're not aware
of Morris High's academic achievements.

17:47.970 --> 17:50.770
I don't doubt that
Morris High is a fine institution...

17:50.940 --> 17:52.770
...but I've already made my decision.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.040
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.370
One of the things I've admired
about Ashley is her open mind.

17:59.550 --> 18:01.780
Well, she gets that from her mother.
Ha-ha-ha.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.340
Uncle Phil, the phone... Ooh.

18:06.220 --> 18:11.280
Hey, listen, man. I can explain everything.
Look, I was dizzy, then I came... I was...

18:11.460 --> 18:13.450
Uh, you must be Will.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.730
I'm Miss Sharpe.

18:16.600 --> 18:22.130
Oh, nice to meet you
for the first time ever in life.

18:24.310 --> 18:28.170
Hey, you know, Uncle Phil,
that's the first time I ever met her in life.

18:29.010 --> 18:31.840
Mr. Banks, we were profiled here
in Education Today.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.950
Maybe if you read it, you'll reconsider.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.810
Nice to meet you.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.010
Sorry you had to drive out here
for nothing.

18:39.190 --> 18:41.950
- Yeah. Bye.
WILL: Bye.

18:42.290 --> 18:45.320
Nice to meet you
for the first time ever in life.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.330
Whoo. She really something, huh?
Hard to say no to her.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.490
Not if you're a parent. Ahem.

18:52.670 --> 18:56.330
Hey, come on, Uncle Phil. Be reasonable.
When's the last time a teacher...

18:56.500 --> 18:57.870
...from Bel-Air Academy
came to the house?

18:58.040 --> 19:02.070
Look, the girl went
and changed schools behind my back.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.210
Now, in this house,
that constitutes a capital crime.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.140
But she had a good reason.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.510
Look, my wife's nephew.

19:11.550 --> 19:15.420
I want Ashley in Bel-Air Academy
where there's a controlled environment.

19:15.590 --> 19:19.120
I know who's there.
But, more importantly, I know who's not.

19:19.290 --> 19:20.390
Listen, I'm telling you.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.890
I went to both public
and private schools...

19:23.060 --> 19:26.470
...and I'm saying in public school,
it's more different kinds of people.

19:26.630 --> 19:29.600
In Bel-Air Academy, everybody
cut from the same mold.

19:29.770 --> 19:31.430
If you ask me, you acting like a...

19:35.880 --> 19:37.780
Snob.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.050
I'm gonna just go.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.390
And a one and a... Hell with that.

19:53.730 --> 19:56.130
<i>ANNOUNCER: The forecast for the...
- Philip, look here.</i>

19:56.300 --> 19:59.760
Morris High School is fourth in
the country among magnet schools.

19:59.930 --> 20:04.870
Magnet schools? Maybe that's why
they need metal detectors, huh? Ha-ha-ha.

20:06.710 --> 20:10.510
- This is important. Don't make jokes.
- Vivian, we've made our decision.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.210
We? No, you've made a decision.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.220
I'm a college professor.
You didn't even ask my opinion.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.410
Didn't I? I'm sure I did.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.820
I'm sorry, honey. What do you think?

20:24.430 --> 20:27.520
I think we should at least consider it.

20:28.030 --> 20:32.590
Sometimes I think we work so hard
to give our kids what we didn't have...

20:32.770 --> 20:35.260
...sometimes we forget to give them
what we did have.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.340
- Good morning, Will.
WILL: Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.110
- Good morning, Ashley.
ASHLEY: Good morning.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.310
What are you eating?

20:50.490 --> 20:52.080
Food.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.820
What are you doing?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.930
Cutting the tension.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.970
Good morning, everyone.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.300
Hey, Hil.

21:09.470 --> 21:13.270
So, what's today's black topic?
Amish rap stars?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.400
I'm through chasing
one specific demographic.

21:16.780 --> 21:21.110
Thanks to my leopard skin midriff top,
I hit an all-time high with male viewers.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.650
I got more men yesterday
than Sally Jesse Raphael gets in a year.

21:25.320 --> 21:26.580
How hard could that be?

21:29.520 --> 21:31.820
PHIL: Where are you going?
- School.

21:31.990 --> 21:35.020
Since when do you wear a uniform
to public school?

21:36.430 --> 21:37.730
What are you talking about?

21:37.900 --> 21:40.130
Your mother and I
had a long talk last night.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.100
I called Miss Sharpe
and made an appointment to check it out.

21:43.270 --> 21:48.970
Now, if I'm satisfied with what I see,
you can give it a shot for a semester.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.480
Oh, Daddy, thank you.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.240
- We're gonna be late. Go change.
- Okay.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.940
Oh, Uncle Phil, thank you.
