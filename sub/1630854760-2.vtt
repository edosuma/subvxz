WEBVTT

00:01.393 --> 00:03.985
(journalists' questions,
indistinct)

00:04.005 --> 00:05.896
- Why'd you do it, Ava?

00:05.914 --> 00:08.749
- Can we get just one word
for the Herald?
Can you talk about the baby?

00:08.901 --> 00:11.385
(silence)

00:14.089 --> 00:18.392
- She has no comment, okay?
And she can't hear you.
Just let us through.

00:24.841 --> 00:27.842
- Where's the interpreter?
- She's stuck in traffic.

00:27.862 --> 00:31.271
- We need an interpreter.
It's the law.
- Yeah, I know!

00:31.365 --> 00:33.924
And if she'd taken the plea
deal, we wouldn't be here.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.183
- Right, she'd be in prison.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.111
- Look, I, I just...

00:38.205 --> 00:41.782
I'm worried the jury
won't find her sympathetic.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.433
Okay?

00:43.435 --> 00:48.005
Juries, uh... they... they feel
very protective about babies.

01:45.422 --> 01:47.397
(He sighs.)

01:50.277 --> 01:51.852
Hi!

01:52.004 --> 01:53.337
Hi.

01:53.430 --> 01:57.574
I was grocery shopping.
I just bought a few things.

01:59.695 --> 02:01.678
I have a green juice for you.

02:01.697 --> 02:03.956
It's much healthier than these.

02:04.107 --> 02:07.793
- A cookie or two won't hurt.

02:07.870 --> 02:10.187
- I know.
God, I'm sorry.

02:10.189 --> 02:12.280
I just overthink everything.

02:12.358 --> 02:14.541
If I was carrying my own baby

02:14.693 --> 02:18.387
I would have eaten
all the cookies by now.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.866
Oh... it's just so unbearable.

02:22.868 --> 02:26.812
I worked full-time through
school, built a business
in a world of men,

02:26.889 --> 02:32.709
stayed married through IVF
but I have this stupid
incompetent cervix

02:32.728 --> 02:36.563
so I can't do the
one thing women are supposed
to be able to do.

02:36.715 --> 02:40.117
That clueless teenagers
do every day!

02:43.980 --> 02:48.667
Oh, I, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

02:52.898 --> 02:56.425
- She says she was 16
and she didn't know anything.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.347
She's glad that she can carry
your baby.

03:05.093 --> 03:07.853
- Um so, I have to go teach.

03:08.004 --> 03:09.855
- Oh, of course!
We're good.

03:09.932 --> 03:11.607
Right?

03:18.590 --> 03:21.033
- He is such a good guy.

03:22.277 --> 03:26.747
I know this must be
weird for him.

03:33.071 --> 03:35.088
- Can I?

03:45.467 --> 03:47.133
- I just...

03:47.286 --> 03:50.971
I want her to hear my voice.

03:51.123 --> 03:53.290
I want her to know me.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.475
You know, I'm afraid

03:55.627 --> 03:59.905
that when she gets here
she won't know me.

03:59.982 --> 04:02.407
You know?

04:04.894 --> 04:08.154
Oh!
What a kick!

04:08.231 --> 04:10.156
Hi, little one!

04:10.233 --> 04:12.900
I'm here!
I'm your mama!

04:12.995 --> 04:16.129
Oh, I can't wait to meet you!

04:20.168 --> 04:23.303
Yeah. She takes after you!

04:27.083 --> 04:29.726
- Let me make you some lunch!

04:41.857 --> 04:44.449
(liquid spilling)

04:51.700 --> 04:53.959
- Oh, is that?

04:56.355 --> 04:58.463
Oh, Ava!

04:59.449 --> 05:01.425
(♪♪)

05:02.528 --> 05:04.619
(phone buzzing)

05:05.380 --> 05:07.547
- Hey! What's goin' on?
I'm just workin'.

05:07.699 --> 05:10.216
<i>- Get your ass to the hospital!</i>
<i> We're havin' a baby!</i>

05:10.293 --> 05:13.720
- Oh, my God!
We're havin' a baby! Okay. Whoo!

05:13.797 --> 05:16.130
(panting)

05:16.150 --> 05:18.817
- Push, Ava! Push!
- You got this, Ava!

05:18.894 --> 05:21.528
(silence)

05:32.558 --> 05:34.458
(baby crying)

05:35.894 --> 05:37.586
- Oh.

05:39.064 --> 05:42.090
- Oh... hello.

05:49.091 --> 05:51.975
(silence)

05:59.509 --> 06:01.985
(baby fussing)

06:02.512 --> 06:04.087
- It's okay.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.941
- So, your baby is
healthy and strong,

06:08.035 --> 06:10.110
with an excellent Apgar score.

06:10.262 --> 06:12.112
Great color, great heart rate,
great reflexes.

06:12.188 --> 06:14.280
- Uh, what about the...
the hearing thing?

06:14.433 --> 06:16.541
- Newborns fail hearing tests
all the time.

06:16.768 --> 06:20.862
For fluid in the ears,
for reasons that aren't
significant.

06:20.939 --> 06:22.363
- Yeah.

06:22.774 --> 06:27.719
- Um, if she can't hear,
it's not because we had
a deaf surrogate, right?

06:27.796 --> 06:29.054
- No. No, no.

06:29.205 --> 06:31.056
There might be a genetic
component,

06:31.207 --> 06:33.708
but I understand you two
were the gamete providers?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.453
- My great-aunt Margo was deaf.

06:36.471 --> 06:39.547
- Oh! Then we'll definitely want
to follow up.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.691
I'll schedule it now.

06:44.463 --> 06:47.147
- Your who?
- My grandmother's sister.

06:47.299 --> 06:48.556
She was an artist.

06:48.634 --> 06:51.743
She used to give me
drawing lessons.

06:53.655 --> 06:56.156
They're gonna do more tests.

06:56.308 --> 06:59.042
Max, it'll be okay.

07:02.998 --> 07:05.465
It'll be okay.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.646
(door closing)

08:30.994 --> 08:34.304
(music in the earphones)

08:41.913 --> 08:43.855
(music stops)

08:44.007 --> 08:45.431
- Can we talk a minute?

08:45.508 --> 08:47.267
- Uh, I kinda need
to finish this.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.677
- It's just that we have
the audiology appointment.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.179
And I know these tests
have been upsetting for you.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.181
- Yeah, well, she cried through
half of them.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.017
Weren't they upsetting for you?

08:56.094 --> 08:57.594
- They were.

08:57.612 --> 09:00.705
But I think it would help
if we talked about it.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.933
About...

09:03.935 --> 09:06.169
her being deaf.

09:09.866 --> 09:11.716
(sighs)

09:17.040 --> 09:19.432
- I don't really know
what to say.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.137
- You could tell me
how you're feeling.

09:24.289 --> 09:27.440
Because not talking about it
is killing me.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.360
- Okay...

09:32.631 --> 09:34.647
I'm feeling betrayed.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.241
- Betrayed?

09:36.968 --> 09:41.913
- You know, I just can't figure
out why you didn't tell me
about your deaf great-aunt.

09:41.990 --> 09:46.008
- Oh... I guess
I never thought about it.

09:46.812 --> 09:49.904
- So she's not why
you chose a deaf surrogate?

09:50.816 --> 09:55.409
- No! I loved the statement
Ava wrote.

09:55.487 --> 09:58.338
She was so genuine and kind.
And she lives so close.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.765
So we could be involved.
- Yeah, I just, I...

10:01.768 --> 10:08.255
I keep thinking
how you were so obsessed
with every little detail.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.391
All the organic groceries.

10:10.393 --> 10:13.670
And so I wonder why
you didn't think of this...

10:13.688 --> 10:17.340
kind of crucial genetic fact.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.266
Or why you would keep that
a secret.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.361
- I didn't keep it secret.

10:21.513 --> 10:23.680
What do I know about
your great-aunts?

10:23.698 --> 10:26.041
- That none of them are deaf!

10:29.946 --> 10:32.464
(soft music)

10:41.716 --> 10:44.458
- Let the record show that the
defendant is charged

10:44.478 --> 10:47.537
with kidnapping and reckless
endangerment of a child.

10:47.539 --> 10:51.132
The jury has received
my preliminary instructions.

10:51.209 --> 10:54.402
We are proceeding
to opening statements.

10:56.882 --> 10:59.491
(theme music)

11:12.488 --> 11:15.064
<i> (woman): Hello.</i>

11:15.083 --> 11:17.717
<i> (woman giggling)</i>

11:19.754 --> 11:21.587
<i> Yeah.</i>

11:21.664 --> 11:23.348
<i> Yeah.</i>

11:24.500 --> 11:26.167
<i> I've never seen that face</i>
<i> before.</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:29.187
Are you comin' to bed?
- Look at this. Look.

11:30.857 --> 11:35.026
<i> - Hello!</i>
- Look at her face when
she hears her mother's voice.

11:36.087 --> 11:38.179
- She looks surprised.

11:38.256 --> 11:40.590
- Well, she looks amazed.

11:41.184 --> 11:43.201
<i>(video): I've never seen that--</i>

11:43.352 --> 11:45.019
- Please come to bed.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.021
Don't you want skin time
with her?

11:47.098 --> 11:48.431
- You know, our insurance
company

11:48.524 --> 11:50.709
is not going to cover the
cochlear implants until she's 2,

11:50.860 --> 11:52.118
that's way too late.

11:52.270 --> 11:54.103
You know thank God
for royalties.

11:54.122 --> 11:56.289
We don't even know
if she's a candidate.

11:56.441 --> 11:59.718
(baby cooing)
(Jenny chuckling)

12:01.722 --> 12:04.130
I know you wanted
a musical kid.

12:04.207 --> 12:05.298
- And that is still possible.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.617
The technology now,
it's just so good.

12:07.635 --> 12:11.521
I mean, sometimes people can't
even tell their kid is deaf.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.308
It's okay.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.527
You're okay.

12:20.131 --> 12:22.699
Let's go to bed, my love.

12:37.832 --> 12:40.984
- I was nearby. I thought you
might want to see the baby.

12:40.986 --> 12:42.761
And you said you had milk?

12:50.011 --> 12:51.494
- Yeah, and
she's gaining weight.

12:51.513 --> 12:55.014
All on track.
96th percentile in height.

12:55.091 --> 12:57.609
So maybe she'll be a supermodel!

12:57.760 --> 12:59.185
Or a rower.

12:59.262 --> 13:01.613
A volleyball player.

13:05.268 --> 13:08.536
- Uh, can I sit down?

13:25.864 --> 13:27.096
- Yeah.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.385
- No, no, no!
Of course not.

13:32.537 --> 13:38.650
Uh, my great-aunt Margo was
deaf, so maybe it's that gene?

13:39.986 --> 13:42.654
And you can see,
she's wonderful!

13:52.223 --> 13:54.490
- Not so good.

13:55.151 --> 13:57.243
He's having a hard time.

13:58.063 --> 14:00.563
Uh... can I ask you a question?

14:00.565 --> 14:03.824
I don't know if this is rude.
Uh...

14:04.569 --> 14:08.162
The audiologist talked
about hearing aids

14:08.181 --> 14:12.333
and sign language
and cochlear implants.

14:13.261 --> 14:17.981
Right. Did you ever think
about getting them?

14:24.939 --> 14:28.741
- But some people use them,
right? Like KJ has
hearing aids.

14:42.123 --> 14:45.942
<i> (woman's voice): The computer</i>
<i> processes sounds</i>
<i> to send to the nerve.</i>

14:45.960 --> 14:48.595
<i> Not the same as hearing.</i>

14:51.040 --> 14:53.282
- Is it close, though?

14:53.301 --> 14:56.060
Max really wants her to hear.

14:56.212 --> 14:58.563
Music is everything to him.

14:59.457 --> 15:03.960
And honestly, I want her
to hear, too, if it's possible.

15:03.962 --> 15:07.071
It's an easier life, right?

15:16.565 --> 15:20.309
Um, Max is my partner

15:20.328 --> 15:23.479
and my baby's father

15:23.481 --> 15:29.594
so I have to make
these decisions with him.

15:32.933 --> 15:37.060
- Parents make decisions
for their children all the time.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.026
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:53.011 --> 15:55.495
Um, she's called Lucie.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.161
(Lucie fussing)

18:26.013 --> 18:28.606
- Ava! Hi.

18:29.943 --> 18:35.404
- Oh! Well, that is
so generous of you, but...

18:37.099 --> 18:39.575
- Um, come on in.

18:40.511 --> 18:42.345
- Hey! Ava!

18:42.363 --> 18:45.665
- I was driving around,
hoping she might sleep.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.368
Ava brought milk!

18:49.520 --> 18:50.686
- Fantastic!

18:51.297 --> 18:54.023
Hey, uh, Ava, I've been
watching this documentary.

18:54.025 --> 18:55.449
It's called "Moonlight Sonata."

18:55.468 --> 18:58.527
It's about a deaf kid
with cochlear implants

18:58.529 --> 19:01.556
who's learning Beethoven
on the piano.

19:08.039 --> 19:11.557
- Right, but the implants are...
they're so much better now.
Right?

19:11.634 --> 19:13.818
Um, you know Jenny told me about
your... your headaches.

19:14.562 --> 19:18.698
But everything's just so much
more advanced now so I guess
that's just science, right?

19:28.984 --> 19:30.543
(Max): Oh...!

19:31.562 --> 19:33.320
"Dear Max and Jenny.

19:33.398 --> 19:36.323
I wanted to try and communicate
something better
than I did in person.

19:36.401 --> 19:40.344
Jenny says you're considering
cochlear implants.

19:40.421 --> 19:43.923
Some people may think
you should let a child
decide later.

19:44.075 --> 19:45.832
There are benefits to deafness.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.336
There's a beautiful culture,
and a beautiful language.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.690
If you knew Lucie was gay, and
would belong to that culture,

19:52.767 --> 19:56.602
you wouldn't get her
a straightness implant
to try to make her life easier.

19:56.679 --> 19:58.011
Right?"

19:58.031 --> 20:01.115
Um, it's not like being gay.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.871
- She said, "How do you know?"
- No, I, I know what she said.

20:07.022 --> 20:09.432
But it's just not the same.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.858
No, no, we don't...
we can't wait. I mean...

20:11.936 --> 20:15.454
The implants work best if
you get them as soon as you can!

20:15.531 --> 20:18.031
- Max, can I talk to you
for a second?

20:18.109 --> 20:20.551
- Excuse... excuse me.

20:26.801 --> 20:28.559
(door closing)

20:32.457 --> 20:35.399
- I told you
we can do the surgery!

20:35.551 --> 20:38.461
Just stop talking about it!
- Why do you want to lie to her?

20:38.463 --> 20:41.388
- I don't! I just don't want
to be insensitive!

20:41.466 --> 20:44.467
- I'm not being insensitive,
I am being honest!

20:44.485 --> 20:46.226
- And incredibly rude!

20:46.304 --> 20:49.247
- If you'd been honest about
your aunt Margo,
we could have tested.

20:49.398 --> 20:51.156
We wouldn't be
in this situation.

20:51.734 --> 20:55.402
- Are you saying
you'd rather not have Lucie?

20:56.163 --> 20:59.498
Our baby, that we tried
so hard to get?

20:59.650 --> 21:01.259
- Jenny, be serious!

21:01.410 --> 21:03.410
- This is a child's life
we're talking about!

21:03.429 --> 21:06.005
- I know!
Are you a eugenicist now?

21:06.157 --> 21:07.840
- No! No!
I'm being rational!

21:07.916 --> 21:09.325
- You're being a nightmare!

21:09.343 --> 21:13.145
- No! I am being a parent!
I am being a father!

21:15.833 --> 21:19.168
- Did I marry a guy
who throws things at his wife?

21:19.186 --> 21:22.238
- I don't know!
I don't know.

21:23.341 --> 21:24.931
Are you gonna throw things
at Lucie?

21:24.951 --> 21:27.493
- No! No. No.

21:30.515 --> 21:32.540
I'm sorry.

21:34.852 --> 21:36.460
I'm...

21:36.462 --> 21:38.779
I'm so sorry.

21:38.873 --> 21:41.549
I'm so sorry.

21:45.363 --> 21:48.055
- We've got to get back to Ava.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.017
- I know.

21:54.722 --> 21:56.055
- Where's Ava?

21:56.131 --> 21:58.682
- Where is she?

21:58.759 --> 22:00.376
Ava?

22:00.378 --> 22:01.736
Ava!

22:03.564 --> 22:06.157
(phone ringing)

22:32.243 --> 22:34.560
(urban soundscape)

23:19.381 --> 23:22.525
- Stop! Stop!
Stop!

25:17.241 --> 25:19.517
- Mrs and Mrs Peterson,
please follow me.

25:19.668 --> 25:21.334
We've reached Ava's mother.

25:22.170 --> 25:26.857
Do you have family that
Ava trusts, or people that
she might be heading toward?

25:27.009 --> 25:30.510
<i> - No.</i>
<i> It's just us, just us two.</i>

25:30.530 --> 25:32.863
<i> I was an only child.</i>
<i> So is Ava.</i>

25:33.533 --> 25:36.200
- What about her father?
She mentioned him.

25:36.351 --> 25:40.854
<i> - I bet she said he left</i>
<i> because she was deaf</i>
<i> and that I blame her for it.</i>

25:41.282 --> 25:43.874
<i> Ava tends to make everything</i>
<i> about herself.</i>

25:44.727 --> 25:49.338
- I've always found her
incredibly generous
and altruistic.

25:52.459 --> 25:55.294
- Does Ava know
where her father lives?

25:55.388 --> 25:58.130
<i> - No. I mean if she did,</i>
<i> she wouldn't tell me.</i>

25:58.206 --> 26:00.391
<i> But he's long gone now.</i>

26:00.542 --> 26:02.301
- Well, she might have
looked for him.

26:02.453 --> 26:05.621
<i> - Ava does what Ava wants.</i>
<i> She's always been stubborn.</i>

26:05.639 --> 26:09.215
- Well, please call us
if she gets in touch.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.343
<i> - I'm telling you, she won't.</i>

26:11.420 --> 26:14.313
- You're her mother.
Why wouldn't she talk to you?

26:14.389 --> 26:17.241
<i> - Just because you rented</i>
<i> my daughter's uterus,</i>

26:17.318 --> 26:20.035
<i> you don't get</i>
<i> to speak to me that way.</i>

26:21.396 --> 26:23.655
<i> I have to go now.</i>
<i> My tour bus is leaving.</i>

26:23.808 --> 26:26.250
- Yes, thank you for joining us
on your vacation.

26:26.327 --> 26:29.402
<i> - I knew surrogacy was going</i>
<i> to be too much for Ava.</i>

26:29.422 --> 26:31.380
<i> I warned her.</i>

26:34.760 --> 26:37.595
- Ava said her mother was tough,
but wow.

26:37.671 --> 26:39.597
Poor Ava.
- Poor Ava?

26:39.673 --> 26:42.341
- Imagine growing up
with a mother like that!

26:42.417 --> 26:43.767
- She stole our baby, Jenny!

26:43.994 --> 26:47.146
It's hard for me to get worked
up about all the why of it.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.668
- Well, we put out a description
of Ava's car and plates.

26:52.670 --> 26:55.696
We'll keep you apprised
when we know something.
(Jenny): Thank you.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.627
(phone vibrating)

28:07.077 --> 28:09.061
(car door closing)

28:12.841 --> 28:14.692
(engine starts)

28:30.876 --> 28:33.085
(sighs)

28:43.948 --> 28:45.705
- Ava...

28:45.783 --> 28:48.058
(dramatic music)

28:51.731 --> 28:54.214
- So I'll be in touch
when we know something, okay?

28:54.959 --> 28:57.809
- Whoa. Wait, wait, wait, what?
You're not arresting him?

28:57.886 --> 29:00.462
- He says he doesn't know
anything.
- And you believe him?

29:00.481 --> 29:02.147
- There's no evidence
that he was involved.

29:02.299 --> 29:04.800
And he came in of his own
accord, to talk.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.651
- Please, KJ.

29:06.804 --> 29:07.970
I'm Lucie's mother.

29:08.155 --> 29:10.247
If there's anything you know
about where my baby is...

29:10.324 --> 29:12.324
- The baby you wanted
to mutilate

29:12.476 --> 29:14.810
and to send back
like a broken damaged package?

29:15.162 --> 29:16.995
- She's our child, dammit!

29:17.147 --> 29:19.256
- Yes, and I teach kids who
have parents just like you two

29:19.407 --> 29:21.275
and they feel like failures
because they can't hear,

29:21.277 --> 29:23.409
and that's all their parents
care about.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.513
Do you know how deep that goes?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.248
- Max!
- Hey.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.008
- How dare you!
- Max!
- Hey!

29:30.160 --> 29:32.511
- You want an assault charge
mixed up with all this?

29:32.587 --> 29:34.480
No, you don't.

29:44.599 --> 29:47.451
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.
Something you deserve.

29:47.602 --> 29:51.179
- Why am I the bad guy?
Ava took our kid!

29:51.198 --> 29:53.532
- Because she thought
we were gonna hurt her!

29:53.684 --> 29:55.942
And because
her mother's a nightmare!

29:55.961 --> 29:58.754
How do you not understand that?

30:33.666 --> 30:36.750
(silence)

31:00.693 --> 31:02.985
- Oh, Lucie!

31:05.197 --> 31:06.989
Oh!

31:07.925 --> 31:10.075
Oh, Lucie.

31:11.428 --> 31:13.445
I love you.

31:13.597 --> 31:15.521
I will always.

31:15.599 --> 31:17.499
I'll always be here.

31:19.694 --> 31:22.954
(Lucie fussing)
Oh, God.

31:23.107 --> 31:25.674
I considered her a friend.

31:27.444 --> 31:29.628
I trusted her completely

31:29.780 --> 31:32.180
and I thought she trusted me.

31:33.708 --> 31:37.543
- It must have felt like a
betrayal, when she took Lucie.

31:37.621 --> 31:40.564
- Objection.
Leading the witness.
- Overruled.

31:43.127 --> 31:45.611
- It did feel like a betrayal.

31:48.966 --> 31:51.617
I'm so sorry.
It did.

31:57.065 --> 31:59.416
- I have no further questions.

32:01.145 --> 32:02.735
- No questions, Your Honor.

32:03.497 --> 32:05.497
- Are you kidding?
No questions?

32:05.573 --> 32:07.758
- Order, please.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.751
- Are you familiar with
postpartum depression, Rose?

32:18.771 --> 32:20.328
- I've heard of it.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.924
- So you know it can be
debilitating,
and can impair judgment?

32:25.002 --> 32:27.444
- I don't know about that.

32:29.597 --> 32:34.267
- Did you see any signs
of depression or stress in Ava,

32:34.361 --> 32:36.119
when you saw her
after the birth?

32:36.196 --> 32:38.997
- No.
She seemed fine.

32:43.854 --> 32:46.296
- Do you remember
when Ava was born?

32:46.373 --> 32:49.299
Uh, how it was for you,
afterward?

32:49.451 --> 32:53.786
- Yes. It was a long
and difficult labor.

32:53.864 --> 32:55.864
And Ava cried.

32:55.957 --> 32:57.866
She cried all the time.

32:57.959 --> 33:00.051
But I still went to work.

33:00.128 --> 33:02.813
I still fulfilled
my commitments.

33:02.964 --> 33:05.207
- I, um...

33:05.209 --> 33:07.734
uh, no further questions.

33:09.046 --> 33:10.803
- No questions, Your Honor.

33:10.881 --> 33:16.218
- Let the record show that
the State has chosen
not to cross-examine.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.478
Let's adjourn for today.

33:18.555 --> 33:21.056
We'll reconvene
at 9 am tomorrow.

33:21.058 --> 33:23.542
Thank you all for your time.

33:25.579 --> 33:28.171
- We told you not to put her
on the stand!

33:28.323 --> 33:29.673
But you... you were so sure
you had it!

33:29.900 --> 33:32.658
- Look, I mean, who throws
her own kid under the bus?

33:32.678 --> 33:34.753
- Ava tried to warn you
but you just didn't listen!

33:34.829 --> 33:38.140
You have to do something!
- I'm doing the best
that I can, okay?

33:45.673 --> 33:49.526
I'm just trying to avoid her
getting 15 years, you know.

33:49.603 --> 33:54.031
So she said no to the 2-year
plea deal but won't...

33:55.367 --> 33:56.849
Good morning.

33:56.927 --> 33:58.869
Uh, this is Sari.

33:59.020 --> 34:00.653
I've briefed her on the case.

34:00.730 --> 34:04.207
And given her the football.

34:04.359 --> 34:08.027
KJ was right. I'm no
the right lawyer for you.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.713
(interpreter): The football?

34:09.864 --> 34:13.133
(interpreter): Can I have
a moment alone with Ava?

35:21.011 --> 35:25.455
(interpreter): Can you tell me
about growing up in a family
that didn't sign?

35:27.868 --> 35:31.611
(interpreter): I'm nervous
saying this,
in front of my mother.

35:32.614 --> 35:35.132
We've never had this
conversation before

35:35.283 --> 35:38.093
and I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

35:40.121 --> 35:41.638
When I was growing up

35:41.715 --> 35:43.623
I was always trying to read lips

35:43.642 --> 35:46.701
to catch what people were saying
at home and at school.

35:46.703 --> 35:50.038
Hearing people always forget
to look at you.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.150
And when I would ask
why are people laughing,

35:53.301 --> 35:55.652
they would say,
"Oh, it's not important."

35:55.729 --> 35:58.071
But it is important to me.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.808
When I was 10 years old,
I went to a deaf school

36:02.886 --> 36:06.663
and finally,
I was able to catch up.

36:07.574 --> 36:09.741
But I'd missed so much.

36:10.560 --> 36:13.244
- Do you know why your family
didn't sign?

36:13.397 --> 36:16.464
- Objection. Irrelevant.
- Overruled.

36:26.910 --> 36:30.520
- When I was two,
my father left.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.362
My mother raised me alone.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.991
She was working all the time.

36:44.277 --> 36:46.444
- You've given birth before,
correct?

36:46.596 --> 36:49.206
That's required for surrogacy.
- Yes.

36:51.268 --> 36:56.104
- When I was in high school
I was pregnant for six months
and I didn't know.

36:57.290 --> 37:02.610
And I would imagine
if the adults in my life were
able to communicate with me,

37:02.629 --> 37:04.946
if they were... motivated,

37:04.965 --> 37:06.781
if they really wanted
to communicate with me,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.975
that wouldn't have happened.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.564
But that experience
led me to this one.

37:15.550 --> 37:17.442
And Lucie...

37:18.886 --> 37:21.238
she's so wonderful.

37:22.799 --> 37:24.557
When I was pregnant with her,

37:24.651 --> 37:28.995
she would kick and I would think
about how she would be
such a good dancer.

37:32.066 --> 37:34.918
After she was born,

37:35.069 --> 37:38.237
her parents didn't seem happy.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.281
And then they started fighting.

37:41.334 --> 37:45.095
And I could see,
or I thought I could see,

37:45.246 --> 37:49.915
that all of the pain
that I endured

37:49.935 --> 37:51.768
for all those years

37:51.845 --> 37:55.522
was about to come to her,
someone I cherished.

37:58.668 --> 37:59.943
And at that moment

38:00.094 --> 38:04.764
all I could think to do
was to protect her,

38:04.766 --> 38:06.674
to make sure she was safe,

38:06.693 --> 38:12.205
to give her all of the love,
and for her to be wanted.

38:18.204 --> 38:21.298
Back in high school, the baby
that I had was hearing.

38:22.208 --> 38:27.470
And maybe someday in the future
I might have a hearing child
of my own.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.974
I know that might not happen now

38:31.125 --> 38:33.143
but I would sign with them,

38:33.219 --> 38:34.886
I would give them options.

38:35.038 --> 38:39.482
I would give them
a hearing role model,
and music, and speech.

38:43.547 --> 38:46.731
Surgery and devices
might be helpful,

38:47.734 --> 38:51.477
but they're not going
to make Lucie like you.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.872
She isn't like you.

38:54.741 --> 38:57.241
If you give her sign language,

38:57.394 --> 39:00.670
she will learn everything
so much faster.

39:00.747 --> 39:03.581
She will be able to study
all different things

39:03.733 --> 39:06.325
and not just focus on learning
how to use her voice.

39:06.403 --> 39:09.262
She will find who she is.

39:11.999 --> 39:16.227
She will have a complete
language from the start.

39:19.358 --> 39:23.693
I think you have to consider
the child

39:23.845 --> 39:26.196
for who they are,

39:26.272 --> 39:29.257
not what you expect them to be.

39:29.851 --> 39:33.495
Just... let them be themselves.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.355
- Thank you.

39:36.433 --> 39:39.125
I have no further questions.

39:52.540 --> 39:56.059
- Would the State like
to cross-examine?

40:00.290 --> 40:02.690
- One moment, please,
Your Honor.

40:07.388 --> 40:09.280
(whispering)

40:14.395 --> 40:17.497
May we approach the bench,
Your Honor?

40:27.667 --> 40:31.719
Your Honor, the parents
don't wish to continue.

40:33.173 --> 40:35.657
- You represent the State,
not the parents.

40:35.659 --> 40:38.009
We've taken a lot of people's
time to get a jury.

40:38.161 --> 40:39.661
- I know.

40:39.679 --> 40:42.330
But they're very insistent.

40:42.423 --> 40:44.332
- Well...

40:44.350 --> 40:47.518
I do think,
based on what we've heard,

40:47.595 --> 40:50.447
that it would be
a miscarriage of justice

40:50.598 --> 40:53.432
to convict
on kidnapping charges.

40:53.452 --> 40:57.287
And no one has established
that the child was endangered.

40:57.363 --> 41:01.199
If the parents are truly
in agreement,

41:01.351 --> 41:05.044
I would look favorably
on a motion to dismiss.

41:13.029 --> 41:16.014
(soft music)

41:57.924 --> 42:02.060
- May I talk to Ava
for just one minute?

42:05.690 --> 42:07.565
Thank you.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.618
I promise.
I heard you.

42:28.195 --> 42:31.256
We're gonna find teachers,
a school.

42:35.461 --> 42:40.098
And maybe you can come see us
sometime...

42:41.709 --> 42:43.726
...with the baby.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.565
- Um...

42:55.799 --> 42:57.657
- Bye.
