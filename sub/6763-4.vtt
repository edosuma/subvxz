{\an3}This place was one

02:56.885 --> 02:58.094
What's that music?

02:58.177 --> 03:00.263
{\an1}It's some geekster
rehearsing in his cabana.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.431

The song.

someone won't understand you.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.381

11:13.464 --> 11:14.757
{\an3}That's perfect.
Super.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.426
{\an3}Yes, yes,
yes, yes.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.928
{\an3}Okay.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.304

11:23.849 --> 11:26.394
{\an3}Great, great, great;
you're beautiful.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.272

to her head yet."

11:42.868 --> 11:43.953

11:44.036 --> 11:45.830

Donna's getting an awful lot

11:45.913 --> 11:46.956
of attention this summer.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.165
Yeah, I know.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.584
{\an1}You think she'll get
her picture in a magazine?

11:50.668 --> 11:53.170
Yeah, and meet a lot
of suave Frenchmen.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.964
{\an1}Oh, come on,
what would she want

11:55.047 --> 11:57.466
{\an1}with some French guy
when she's got me?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.634
Oh, obviously.

11:58.717 --> 12:02.638
{\an3}What would she want with
some sexy, talented European,

12:02.721 --> 12:05.015
when she could have you
and your stupid music?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.642
{\an1}Well, believe it
or not, Kel,

12:06.725 --> 12:08.310
some people seem
to like my music.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.187
{\an3}Yeah, people who
are tone deaf.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.273
Think what you want.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.984
What, do you have some
sort of secret admirer?

12:15.067 --> 12:19.488
Maybe I do.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.199
{\an3}David, is there something
you wanted to tell me here?

12:22.283 --> 12:24.118
No.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.162
Look, I got to go rehearse.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.165
{\an3}David Silver, you have
something going on, don't you?

12:29.248 --> 12:33.169
No, no, it's just me
and my stupid music.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.795

12:34.879 --> 12:37.882

have a copy of your
demo when you're done?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.985
{\an3}I'd really
like to have it.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.904
Uh, well, it probably won't be
finished for a while,

12:59.987 --> 13:01.155
but if you give me your address

13:01.238 --> 13:02.031
up in San Francisco,
I'll send it to you.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.909
My boyfriend's band
made a demo tape.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.161
They're called Waste Management.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.078
He's the drummer.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.207
But they burned the master
in protest

13:11.290 --> 13:12.500
when all the record companies

13:12.583 --> 13:13.918
turned it down.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.961
Wouldn't your boyfriend
be jealous if he found out

13:16.045 --> 13:18.756
you were hanging out with me?

13:18.839 --> 13:20.049
Nah.

13:20.132 --> 13:20.883
We have an understanding.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.719
Besides,

13:23.802 --> 13:27.848
I think keyboard players
are way hotter than drummers.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.526
Is the bus here yet?

13:38.609 --> 13:40.236
Well, nice of you
to join us.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.529
Why wouldn't I?
I've been dying

13:41.612 --> 13:42.238
to go to Versailles
ever since I got to Paris.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.948
Well, I don't know. I thought

13:44.031 --> 13:45.074
maybe you were boycotting
the program.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.075
No.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.077
I just took a little break,
that's all.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.245
I mean,
Pierre finished the portfolio.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.789
Pierre? How stupid of me.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.124
Of course you would be
on a first name basis by now.

by that?

Oh, relax, she won't bite.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.685
She doesn't have any teeth.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.730
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.106
Whoa.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.274
Come here.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.317
Oh. Shh.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.112
What a sweet girl.

19:57.195 --> 20:00.282
Shh, shh, shh.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.242
Shh, shh,
shh.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.161
It's okay, it's okay.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.163
Oh, yeah.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.456
Sure, sweet girl.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.291
You got a nice setup here,
you know that?

20:09.374 --> 20:11.460
Can you tell?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.045
(laughing):
Yeah.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.796
You got a mom and a dad.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.799
You got brother David,
sister Kelly.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.010
You like that?

20:20.093 --> 20:21.678
Let me tell you something,
though.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.973
You take it from me--
don't let 'em get too close.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.643
You'll just get burned.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.937
Rule number one:

20:30.020 --> 20:32.522
the only person you can trust
in this world is yourself.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.618
(accordion playing,
crowd chatter)

20:47.621 --> 20:49.373
Relax, Brenda.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.166
Donna's a big girl.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.459
But you don't know
Donna like I do.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.378
{\an3}I mean, missing
Versailles was one thing,

20:54.461 --> 20:56.630
but a day of shopping?

20:56.713 --> 20:57.881
Now, that's serious.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.050
{\an3}You know, I can't
believe she missed it

21:00.133 --> 21:02.636
just 'cause she had to
run off to "le shoot."

21:02.719 --> 21:03.887
What do you expect?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.013
She's the center of attention.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.598
She's being fawned over
and admired.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.891
No.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.186
And I hear
Pierre's no slouch himself.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.355
Come on, she is crazy
about her boyfriend.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.815
Uh-huh.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.483
No, you-you just
don't know Donna.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.986
But I do know Paris.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.570
And I do know older men.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.530
And I do know
the modeling scene.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.866
{\an1}I did a few jobs
myself in New York.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.159
So what does that mean?

21:26.243 --> 21:29.496
It means that if Donna is
as naive as you say she is,

21:29.579 --> 21:33.291
she's got
a rude awakening coming.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.545
You know what, Maggie?

21:36.628 --> 21:38.046
Maybe you're right.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.257
I know I'm right.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.844
So, do you have another one
of those?

21:46.847 --> 21:48.473
<i>Merci.</i>

21:48.557 --> 21:50.934
Let's face it, Brenda.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.436
{\an1}Sooner or later,
with the camera or without it,

21:52.519 --> 21:54.604
Monsieur Pierre is going
to want Mademoiselle Donna

21:54.688 --> 21:57.274
to take her clothes off.

21:58.608 --> 22:02.279
(coughing)

22:02.362 --> 22:04.072
These are really good.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.199
(coughs)

22:09.619 --> 22:11.621
(door creaking)

22:18.045 --> 22:19.963
Donna, what time is it?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.257
Bren, I'm really sorry
to wake you.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.259
The most wonderful thing
happened to me tonight...

22:24.342 --> 22:25.093
(clattering)
Ow!

22:28.305 --> 22:30.098
Are you okay? What happened?

22:30.182 --> 22:31.933
Oh, yeah, I just bumped my knee.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.435
{\an1}No, I mean tonight;
what happened with Pierre?

22:33.518 --> 22:36.354
Oh, this.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.733
What is this?
A contract.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.276
Well, except it's all in French,

22:41.359 --> 22:42.986
which you'll probably have
to help me translate.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.571
We can just do
that tomorrow.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.156
(yawns)

22:46.239 --> 22:48.116
<i>Je suis tres fatiguée.</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:50.619
Donna, what kind of contract?

22:50.702 --> 22:52.788
Well, Pierre wants me
to sign with this agency.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.624
He says my type is really
in demand right now.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.334
Donna, wait a second.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.586
You're gonna drop out
of the program to be a model?

22:59.669 --> 23:02.964
Come on, Bren, I wasn't
doing so well anyway.

23:03.048 --> 23:03.673
I'm really wiped out.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.134
{\an3}Good night.
(switch clicks)

23:07.385 --> 23:09.137
(switch clicks)

23:09.221 --> 23:10.680
Donna, this contract
is for two years.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.642
Bren, please,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.977
We'll talk about this tomorrow--
good night.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.521
(switch clicks)

23:30.909 --> 23:32.577
What?
(chuckles)

23:32.661 --> 23:35.914
Wait a minute,
are you trying to tell me

23:35.997 --> 23:37.791
{\an1}that you and Donna
still haven't done the nasty?

23:37.874 --> 23:38.667
Keep your voice down.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.461
It's not that I
don't want to.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.005
{\an3}It's just that Donna wants
to wait until she's married.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.799
Then what's the problem?

23:45.882 --> 23:47.801
If this girl Nikki
wants it from you,

23:47.884 --> 23:50.303
{\an1}which personally makes me
question <i> her</i> sanity,

23:50.387 --> 23:50.846
then go for it.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.973
But what about Donna?

23:53.056 --> 23:55.517
First of all...

23:55.600 --> 23:58.353
{\an1}Donna may want to be
a virgin until she's married,

23:58.436 --> 24:00.355
{\an1}but finally, when she
decides to do it,

24:00.438 --> 24:03.358
{\an1}she's not gonna want
some inexperienced bozo.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.820
And second, Donna is
in Paris, remember?

24:06.903 --> 24:09.364
She's probably got French dudes
crawling all over her.

24:09.447 --> 24:11.658
{\an3}No, Donna
wouldn't do that.

24:11.741 --> 24:14.327
Would she?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.329
Trust me.

24:16.413 --> 24:21.042
{\an4}(playful French accent):
While ze cat is away,
ze mice will play.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.377
{\an1}BROOKE:
Steve.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.879
Game time!

24:23.962 --> 24:25.547
Ooh, excuse me, lame-o.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.925
I've got some scoring
of my own to do-- mm!

24:38.810 --> 24:41.646
Hey.
Hi.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.398
{\an1}I just wanted
to tell you thanks

24:43.481 --> 24:45.358
{\an1}for keeping me
company last night.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.406
(imitating Bogart):
Anytime, sweetheart.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.116
STEVE:
Hey, guys.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.743
Prepare to meet your doom.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.412
Something tells me

24:57.495 --> 24:59.539
{\an3}our winning streak may
have just come to an end.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.041
Yeah.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.004
(Kelly laughs)

25:06.087 --> 25:07.714
That's a nice move.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.424
{\an5}Can I use that?
You're funny,
you're funny,

25:09.507 --> 25:10.967
{\an3}you know that?
Got 'em now.

25:11.051 --> 25:11.801
{\an1}All right Kel, I want you
to play right here.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.887
{\an3}No, Dylan, I want to
play back there.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.555
{\an1}No, I'm gonna play
back there, all right?

25:15.639 --> 25:17.265
You're the front, I'm the back,
that's how it works.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.601
Okay.
Ready?

25:19.684 --> 25:20.810
{\an1}Get ready.
I'm ready.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.687
Like this--
this is ready.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.942
That was yours.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.985
{\an5}Are you playing dodge ball?
No, I'm not, that
was your ball.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.570
{\an1}Okay, right here,
this is where you stand.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.572
When they come to you,
hit it back over, okay?

25:33.865 --> 25:35.951
{\an1}I got it. I got it.
I got it.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.953
{\an1}I got it, look out.
Hey, I've-- oh...

25:38.036 --> 25:38.912
Get it, get it.
Fine.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.455
You are smooth.

25:40.538 --> 25:41.581
You've got it, no, you.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.124
{\an1}You're good,
you're gifted.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.252
Tremendous.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.799
Whoa!

25:50.882 --> 25:51.800
{\an1}Yes! Yes!
Yeah, all right!

25:51.883 --> 25:53.885
All right.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.638
{\an3}You keep shopping,
all right?

25:56.721 --> 25:58.807
Shut up.
You're good at it.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.225
Better stick to surfing, dude.

26:03.561 --> 26:04.980
{\an3}Sure looks like I
chose the right partner.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.106
You better believe it.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.357
{\an1}We're practically
in the finals.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.734
Where I come from,

26:09.818 --> 26:11.444
it ain't over till it's over.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.029
{\an1}Well, yeah,
but that doesn't mean

26:13.113 --> 26:15.448
we can't have our own
private celebration.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.784
{\an1}My mom's out of town
and I just happen

26:17.867 --> 26:19.869
{\an1}to know where she
stashes the Dom Perignon.

26:21.913 --> 26:26.293
Steve, you're a great guy.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.295
You really are.

26:28.378 --> 26:28.837
And I like you...

26:30.922 --> 26:32.841
As a friend.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.302
{\an3}I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.511
No, it's okay.

26:36.594 --> 26:37.512
I get the picture.

26:37.595 --> 26:39.848
It's Brandon, isn't it?

26:44.894 --> 26:46.896
{\an3}Steve...

26:49.607 --> 26:50.859
I'll see you at the finals.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.955
DONNA:
<i>What, are you mad at me?</i>

27:04.039 --> 27:05.707
Donna, I'm not even sure
I know you anymore.

27:05.790 --> 27:09.002
You are so dramatic.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.005
I'm dramatic?

27:12.088 --> 27:13.715
You're running away
to become a French

27:13.798 --> 27:15.175
{\an3}fashion model and
I'm dramatic?

27:15.258 --> 27:15.842
Come on, Brenda,
this is the most

27:15.925 --> 27:18.345
exciting thing I've ever done.

27:18.428 --> 27:18.845
{\an1}Can't you at least
be happy for me?

27:18.928 --> 27:21.389
Happy?

27:21.473 --> 27:22.474
{\an3}Happy, that you're
dropping out?

27:22.557 --> 27:24.726
{\an3}That you're not even going
to graduate high school?

27:24.809 --> 27:25.268
Donna, I'm in shock!

27:25.352 --> 27:27.395
I'll do it eventually.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.772
I can take the proficiency test
or something.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.732
You know, your parents are never
going to let you do this.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.985
Well, you've done things your
parents haven't approved of.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.031
Donna, you hate it here.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.116
{\an3}All I've been hearing
from you is how you're never

27:40.200 --> 27:43.036
{\an3}gonna learn to speak French,
and now you want to <i> live</i> here?

27:43.119 --> 27:44.329
Not just here.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.080
{\an1}Some girls get to go
all over Europe,

27:45.163 --> 27:47.415
and I could earn
a lot of money.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.708
You have money.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.960
Not my own, that I earn myself.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.962
Don't you understand, Brenda?

27:53.046 --> 27:54.964
I can be more than the dummy

27:55.048 --> 27:58.218
{\an1}who can't keep up
with her smart friends.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.928
This is <i> my</i> chance to stand out,
to achieve something.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.930
And what about David?

28:02.013 --> 28:03.765
Or doesn't he matter,

28:03.848 --> 28:07.560
now that Pierre is
interested in you?

28:07.644 --> 28:09.979
Pierre is interested
in me professionally,

28:10.063 --> 28:10.772
not romantically.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.982
Give him time.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.568
{\an1}Brenda, he's married
and has two kids.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.194
I've seen the pictures.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.113
Donna, I hate to say this,

28:18.196 --> 28:19.823
{\an3}but that didn't
stop your parents.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.955
{\an1}You know, you must be
really jealous

28:27.038 --> 28:29.624
of what's happening to me,
to throw that in my face.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.334
I'm sorry.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.128
{\an3}I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.004
Well, it's too late.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.048
You already have.

28:46.724 --> 28:47.517
(laughing)

28:47.600 --> 28:50.437
{\an4}Hi.
Hi, oh, hey,
these are my parents.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.313
{\an1}Jim and Cindy Walsh,
this is Brooke Alexander.

28:52.397 --> 28:52.981
A fellow Minnesotan.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.024
{\an3}Oh, hi.
Hey, very nice.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.317
{\an3}Nice to meet you.
Welcome.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.153
You've got a very
industrious son.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.613
Well, he, uh, takes
after his old man.

29:00.697 --> 29:01.781
Come on, old man.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.826
Let's get you out of the sun
before your brain addles.

29:04.909 --> 29:05.910
{\an1}Bye-bye.
Bye, guys.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.292
You didn't call me last night.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.128
{\an1}Yeah, well, I, uh,
I crashed out pretty early.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.213
What time do you
get off, anyway?

29:17.297 --> 29:19.549
Whenever I'm done,
usually about 7:00.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.970
{\an3}You wanna take a drive up
the coast afterwards?

29:27.098 --> 29:29.017
Uh...
(chuckles)

29:29.100 --> 29:32.520

and he really likes you.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.984

29:45.283 --> 29:48.661

{\an1}(whistle blows)
All right!

41:34.825 --> 41:36.785
(whistle blows)

41:40.289 --> 41:42.291
14 serving 13.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.209
Match point.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.044
Come on, come on!

41:53.344 --> 41:55.221
(whistle blows, crowd cheering)

41:56.680 --> 42:00.559
{\an3}(laughing)

42:00.643 --> 42:02.603
Game and match,
Sanders and Alexander.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.939
{\an3}All right!

42:09.527 --> 42:09.944
{\an1}Good work!
Thank you.

42:10.027 --> 42:10.778
That was so good.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.405
Right on.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.453
{\an1}Congratulations.
Thank you.

42:19.536 --> 42:20.829
Excuse me.

42:20.913 --> 42:21.997
Okay.

42:24.750 --> 42:28.337
{\an3}Hey, guys.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.046
Party at my house?

42:29.129 --> 42:31.757
Steve, I hope we can be friends.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.302
Well... okay.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.971
(laughs)

42:37.054 --> 42:38.347
You got to remember
one thing, though.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.266
{\an3}He may have a
terrific smile, but

42:40.349 --> 42:42.309
{\an3}I could wipe him off
the court in volleyball.

42:48.190 --> 42:50.150
{\an3}(chuckles)

42:50.234 --> 42:53.320
{\an3}Let's go.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.405
Come on, Pokey.

42:57.366 --> 43:00.160
You know, I thought I was making
a mistake not going to Paris,

43:00.244 --> 43:02.621
but this summer's
turning out okay.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.165
Yeah, it is.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.751
Louie, I think this is

43:07.835 --> 43:11.171
the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.352
{\an1}Kelly.
Check it out.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.395
Donna sent me a postcard.

43:26.478 --> 43:27.980
"Dear David,

43:28.063 --> 43:30.149
"I've really gotten into
the swing of things here,

43:30.232 --> 43:31.900
{\an1}"and Brenda says my French
is even good enough

43:31.984 --> 43:33.027
"to go shopping alone.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.194
(chuckles)

43:34.278 --> 43:36.363
{\an1}Love you.
Miss you. Donna."

43:36.447 --> 43:38.866
{\an1}Cool, huh?

43:38.949 --> 43:39.825
{\an1}She misses me,
and she loves me.

43:39.908 --> 43:41.869
That's very cool.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.204
I'm really happy
for you, David.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.873
{\an1}Look, I just want
to thank you

43:45.956 --> 43:50.044
{\an1}for setting me straight
on being faithful and all.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.046
{\an1}You're a great sister.
Thanks.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.010
You're welcome.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.179
Look... get out of here.

44:00.262 --> 44:01.221
I got to change.

44:01.305 --> 44:01.889
Okay, I'll see you later.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.974
{\an3}Okay.
