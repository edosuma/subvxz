WEBVTT

00:08.109 --> 00:09.109
Drink.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.000
I'll ask you again.

00:11.283 --> 00:12.393
Lucien Grimaud,

00:14.200 --> 00:15.240
where is he?

00:18.330 --> 00:20.329
Bit sore, is it?

00:20.330 --> 00:23.098
Grimaud will finish the job soon enough.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.440
Your boss,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.240
the one who ran away,

00:26.555 --> 00:28.405
he's had his chance.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.230
He failed.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.330
Now it's our turn.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.420
We don't fail.

00:33.913 --> 00:36.853
Got to find him first, fat boy!

00:36.878 --> 00:39.156
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:40.420 --> 00:42.210
Brujon, come here.

00:43.496 --> 00:44.523
Come here.

00:44.547 --> 00:46.547
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
- Come here, come here.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.732
You want to be a Musketeer, don't you?

00:49.757 --> 00:51.340
He's a cadet.

00:51.654 --> 00:53.604
- I can't.
- It's fine, take this.

00:53.629 --> 00:55.669
Consider it an entrance test.
Take a big deep breath.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.390
Just relax.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.565
Shh, shh, shh... Easy, easy.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.600
Fire.

01:19.610 --> 01:20.610
Wait!

01:24.170 --> 01:26.590
He left Paris last night.
I don't know where.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.520
- Fire.
- East!

01:30.214 --> 01:32.214
He rode east of the city.

01:32.239 --> 01:34.309
I swear I don't know any more.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.440
There we are.

01:38.550 --> 01:40.430
Thank you.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.545
You said he was a cadet.

01:53.570 --> 01:54.701
He is a cadet.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.470
He's a Musketeer cadet.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.817
You can go after him.
But you won't find him.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.760
And one night soon you'll wake

02:04.785 --> 02:06.964
and he'll be standing over your bed.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.509
And his face will be the last thing

02:09.520 --> 02:12.440
you see before you die.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.470
Waste of time.

03:02.321 --> 03:03.500
He could be anywhere by now.

03:04.470 --> 03:05.530
Headed for Lorraine?

03:05.540 --> 03:06.570
It's unlikely.

03:06.595 --> 03:08.841
Two hundred mile ride
and he's carrying injuries.

03:08.866 --> 03:12.550
A long list of nobles in the
East who need sweet-talking.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.520
If you were him where would you start?

03:14.530 --> 03:15.580
Eparcy.

03:16.570 --> 03:17.600
The village he's from.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.580
And how would you know that?

03:19.590 --> 03:21.169
He told me.

03:21.194 --> 03:23.264
When he was trying to win my trust.

03:23.490 --> 03:24.864
I heard you hadn't found him yet.

03:24.889 --> 03:26.510
That he's fled the city.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.570
Where I shot him,

03:27.580 --> 03:30.315
it's a wonder he survived
at all. He'll need to heal.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.330
Men like him are like rats.

03:33.355 --> 03:35.335
They go back to places they know best.

04:05.825 --> 04:07.695
Then it's definitely east.

04:07.720 --> 04:08.790
Middle of the Eastern battlefield,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.700
been fought over for decades.

04:10.710 --> 04:13.610
We were stationed near there
after the Battle of Arras.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.779
The stories that came out of that place,

04:18.511 --> 04:20.461
they were pretty bad.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.692
If he grew up there...

04:26.611 --> 04:28.550
How far?

04:28.575 --> 04:30.545
It's maybe a day's ride.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.660
Athos,

04:32.790 --> 04:33.790
your arm.

04:35.143 --> 04:36.183
I have another.

04:40.433 --> 04:42.183
I told you a full state funeral.

04:42.208 --> 04:44.605
I specifically ordered it!

04:44.630 --> 04:45.630
Your Majesty,

04:45.655 --> 04:48.675
we do not give state funerals
to traitors!

04:48.700 --> 04:49.730
Governor Feron,

04:49.755 --> 04:52.595
Philippe saved my life.

04:53.038 --> 04:55.088
Is that the act of a traitor?

04:55.460 --> 04:56.480
A hundred thousand livres

04:56.490 --> 04:58.490
to the man who brings me Grimaud's head.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.974
What do we know of where he is now?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.565
The Musketeers are searching
for him as we speak.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.225
He'll be working on his allies,

05:04.250 --> 05:06.129
using Gaston to gather support.

05:06.154 --> 05:07.164
Support?

05:07.189 --> 05:08.248
An army.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.413
Your Majesty,
he'll be gathering an army.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.056
Well we have our own army.

05:12.081 --> 05:14.469
Scattered across
France and under-equipped.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.469
If even a half the nobles give way,

05:16.470 --> 05:19.490
the garrison will not be
enough to defend Paris.

05:26.815 --> 05:28.685
We must speak of the Regency.

05:30.944 --> 05:32.092
Not now.

05:32.117 --> 05:33.265
Majesty,

05:33.290 --> 05:35.792
surely you cannot still plan
to name Gaston?

05:35.817 --> 05:38.043
For all we know he may
have been abducted.

05:38.068 --> 05:39.714
One brother of mine is dead.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.067
I do not intend to condemn

05:41.092 --> 05:42.675
the other before he has had
a chance to speak.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.658
Louis, Gaston has shown
no loyalty to you.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.590
To your son.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.420
Oh really, Anne?
You wish to speak of this?

05:50.642 --> 05:51.680
Of loyalty?

05:51.705 --> 05:54.630
- I merely meant...
- Enough politics.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.940
Escort my wife back to her rooms.

06:31.292 --> 06:32.482
We're close now.

06:32.507 --> 06:34.417
I'd say a couple of miles out.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.510
There's a child here?

06:50.273 --> 06:51.383
It's alright,

06:51.854 --> 06:52.854
no need to be scared.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.640
Hey.

07:19.412 --> 07:20.637
Where did she...

07:24.610 --> 07:26.450
Athos!

07:28.590 --> 07:30.420
Let us down.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.897
We are Musketeers
here on orders from Paris.

07:37.922 --> 07:39.962
Impede us and you will
answer to the King himself.

07:43.331 --> 07:45.521
It is he who should be answering to us.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.640
His men run wild
through the countryside.

07:49.181 --> 07:51.699
We make no apology
for defending ourselves.

07:53.485 --> 07:55.555
There was a child.

07:55.580 --> 07:56.580
The child's seen...

07:56.605 --> 07:58.816
All soldiers will follow a crying girl.

07:59.460 --> 08:00.831
Their reasons vary.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.490
What were yours, I wonder?

08:04.480 --> 08:06.569
We are pursuing a fugitive.

08:06.804 --> 08:08.754
We need somewhere to spend the night.

08:09.801 --> 08:11.880
And any information you can give us.

08:11.905 --> 08:14.410
You'll be lucky if we let
you go with your weapons.

08:17.550 --> 08:19.420
Something amuses you?

08:21.500 --> 08:23.500
I've been tied up by women too but...

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
It's only ever been recreational.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.630
May I?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.470
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

08:37.113 --> 08:38.576
Many soldiers have made the mistake

08:38.601 --> 08:39.779
of not taking us seriously.

08:39.804 --> 08:41.919
A mistake I'm sure they've regretted.

08:41.945 --> 08:44.984
I know what men can
become in times like these.

08:44.985 --> 08:47.894
These soldiers are my friends

08:47.895 --> 08:50.595
and there's nothing we hold more sacred

08:50.620 --> 08:52.925
than a woman's sovereignty
over her own life.

08:53.502 --> 08:55.402
We are here

08:55.482 --> 08:56.582
for a man.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.670
A man

09:00.417 --> 09:01.595
by the name

09:02.611 --> 09:03.865
of Lucien Grimaud.

09:05.803 --> 09:07.176
You know him?

09:07.208 --> 09:09.188
There's no one of that name here.

09:09.213 --> 09:11.283
I recommend you continue on your way.

09:11.879 --> 09:14.316
In this village we cannot
guarantee your safety.

09:14.341 --> 09:16.231
We do not require your guarantee.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.498
You force me to insist.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.672
Or your consent.

09:18.985 --> 09:21.420
Come, Juliette.

09:21.445 --> 09:23.513
One night can't hurt.

09:23.538 --> 09:25.945
In the morning we will
send them on their way.

09:34.193 --> 09:35.323
One night only.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.242
You built this place?

10:18.915 --> 10:19.915
Us women?

10:21.230 --> 10:22.711
No need to sound so surprised.

10:24.863 --> 10:26.875
I'm not surprised.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.476
I'm impressed.

10:41.586 --> 10:43.586
Juliette doesn't really like strangers.

10:45.505 --> 10:46.545
We'd never have guessed.

10:46.555 --> 10:48.810
We've had raids recently. Looters.

10:48.835 --> 10:50.640
You look like you're managing all right.

10:50.665 --> 10:51.685
We're learning.

10:51.695 --> 10:53.132
I can see that,

10:53.157 --> 10:54.675
your traps are

10:54.685 --> 10:56.101
very effective.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.675
Well they keep most of the vermin out.

10:57.685 --> 10:59.485
Some sneak through.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.510
Don't tell her,

11:03.535 --> 11:05.475
it's ale, it's not water.

11:07.406 --> 11:10.366
Bastien's been staying
with us for a couple of days.

11:10.391 --> 11:12.122
We found him in the forest.

11:12.147 --> 11:13.638
Well, you rescued me, more like.

11:15.177 --> 11:16.585
What? You injured?

11:16.595 --> 11:20.545
Yes, I was on my way
to Eparcy, looking for work

11:20.555 --> 11:22.998
when I came across some bored soldiers

11:23.023 --> 11:25.620
who saw a cripple

11:25.645 --> 11:27.505
and an afternoon's amusement.

11:31.585 --> 11:33.545
My husband's away fighting.

11:33.555 --> 11:34.665
As are all our men.

11:34.675 --> 11:37.967
He's in the Picardy regiment,
under the Compte de Bauvais.

11:37.992 --> 11:41.527
Have you heard anything of them?

11:43.550 --> 11:44.560
What?

11:44.812 --> 11:45.812
Tell me.

11:47.244 --> 11:49.284
They were due to advance on Freiburg.

11:50.635 --> 11:52.625
That's all we know.

11:52.635 --> 11:54.505
Put him out of your mind.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.480
If he isn't dead, he may as well be.

12:05.457 --> 12:06.904
Fetch some firewood for them.

12:06.929 --> 12:08.729
I'll help you.

12:11.585 --> 12:13.545
So this Lucien Grimaud.

12:13.555 --> 12:15.138
What do you want with him?

12:15.163 --> 12:16.223
He's a criminal.

12:16.545 --> 12:17.670
Hardly a rarity these days.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.565
This isn't just some boy stealing sheep.

12:20.590 --> 12:22.351
He's dangerous, a murderer.

12:23.545 --> 12:25.625
If we don't find him he will kill again.

12:31.856 --> 12:32.866
You know that name.

12:32.891 --> 12:34.604
I saw it in your eyes.

12:34.605 --> 12:36.328
I knew his mother once.

12:36.353 --> 12:37.543
Once?

12:38.094 --> 12:40.219
We were children together.
She was my best friend.

12:40.715 --> 12:42.615
But her

12:42.625 --> 12:43.898
family disowned her.

12:44.645 --> 12:46.605
She left here a long time ago.

12:47.695 --> 12:49.624
Where is she now?

12:49.625 --> 12:51.575
Dead, I expect.

12:55.645 --> 12:58.302
The day we let our guests go hungry

12:58.327 --> 12:59.644
is the day we are truly lost.

12:59.669 --> 13:00.655
Please.

13:00.665 --> 13:01.715
Thank you.

13:04.652 --> 13:07.702
You haven't found your man then, yet?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.785
He grew up near here, we believe.

13:12.336 --> 13:13.416
In, um...

13:13.645 --> 13:14.559
Eparcy.

13:14.584 --> 13:16.615
Ah, a few miles that way.

13:18.992 --> 13:20.942
So have you got a name for this place?

13:23.433 --> 13:26.383
It has no name. That's how
they keep themselves safe.

13:26.635 --> 13:27.635
It's um...

13:28.555 --> 13:30.565
It was built by us.

13:33.299 --> 13:34.664
After our men first left

13:34.689 --> 13:36.671
and the soldiers kept coming,

13:37.234 --> 13:39.374
we took as much as we
could carry from Eparcy.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.635
A few tools and animals. Came here.

13:41.645 --> 13:42.705
It's not much.

13:42.715 --> 13:44.665
But it's safe.

13:44.675 --> 13:46.625
At least we thought it was.

13:46.635 --> 13:48.127
If Grimaud is alive

13:48.152 --> 13:50.052
and here, you won't be.

13:51.407 --> 13:53.636
If you know anything.
Help us keep you safe.

13:59.513 --> 14:00.503
I...

14:01.665 --> 14:04.535
Was walking this morning.

14:04.545 --> 14:05.897
There's a cabin in the forest.

14:05.922 --> 14:07.645
It's abandoned, but...

14:08.675 --> 14:09.715
What?

14:11.615 --> 14:13.178
I saw a fire.

14:13.203 --> 14:14.514
A pair of man's boots.

14:14.539 --> 14:15.951
Bloody bandages.

14:17.819 --> 14:18.819
And this.

14:27.615 --> 14:30.485
Stop there! Stop!

14:35.665 --> 14:37.545
Is it Grimaud?

14:39.515 --> 14:40.615
It's not him.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.635
They're soldiers. French.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.213
I heard, I heard them coming

14:45.238 --> 14:47.585
and I, I tried to stop them.

14:47.595 --> 14:48.675
Let's get her inside.

15:04.715 --> 15:06.675
How many of these raids have there been?

15:06.685 --> 15:08.655
That's the third this week.

15:08.665 --> 15:10.394
They're looking for food.

15:10.419 --> 15:11.605
Um...

15:12.605 --> 15:14.505
I tried to defend them.

15:17.585 --> 15:19.545
It's not your fault if you can't fight.

15:24.705 --> 15:26.515
He's injured.

15:27.449 --> 15:29.399
And he can't get far.

15:31.565 --> 15:32.635
Grimaud?

15:32.645 --> 15:34.525
We'll need more torches.

15:36.532 --> 15:38.512
For Christ's sake, where's that ale?

15:43.685 --> 15:45.675
Will you let me see?

16:06.475 --> 16:07.514
What do you want?

16:07.515 --> 16:09.017
Clean needle and thread, if you have it.

16:09.042 --> 16:10.505
A poultice.

16:10.685 --> 16:13.346
Athos was

16:13.371 --> 16:15.635
badly injured two days ago.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.535
We have little to spare

16:17.545 --> 16:20.485
and too many injuries
to spare it for strangers.

16:20.655 --> 16:22.495
I see.

16:23.545 --> 16:25.544
I want you to understand. We're not

16:25.545 --> 16:27.515
like those other men.

16:27.525 --> 16:29.485
That's what you all say.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.232
Make him sleep.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.326
Then take him home.

16:32.351 --> 16:34.291
We're not going to leave you.
Not with these looters.

16:34.316 --> 16:36.336
We've survived long enough without you.

16:36.361 --> 16:38.077
And I intend to keep it that way.

16:55.635 --> 16:56.655
Sorry.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.106
I grew up on a farm.

17:00.695 --> 17:02.604
You shouldn't be working.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.535
What else am I going to do?

17:05.377 --> 17:06.900
- Let me take that.
- I can manage.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.675
I know you were trying to be kind.

17:15.021 --> 17:16.961
But I also know you were lying.

17:17.834 --> 17:18.844
About my husband.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.460
Please.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.505
Tell me what you know.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.515
Bauvais' men did advance on Freiburg...

17:31.615 --> 17:32.645
Six months ago.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.660
And there were heavy losses.

17:39.705 --> 17:41.515
The whole company.

17:49.293 --> 17:50.894
I'm so sorry.

18:09.202 --> 18:10.580
At least I know now.

18:10.605 --> 18:11.605
Yeah.

18:16.482 --> 18:19.442
I just wish my son had met his father.

18:21.337 --> 18:22.585
Just once.

18:25.575 --> 18:27.010
You know it's a boy, do you?

18:27.885 --> 18:28.885
I hope so.

18:31.765 --> 18:33.685
My mother raised me alone.

18:34.341 --> 18:35.501
She had strength,

18:38.095 --> 18:39.095
like you.

18:42.227 --> 18:43.595
And I turned out all right.

18:46.705 --> 18:48.495
Yes. You did.

18:52.751 --> 18:54.811
I don't think we can do this
for much longer on our own.

18:56.665 --> 18:58.565
You're not on your own.

19:02.134 --> 19:03.304
I should go.

19:13.576 --> 19:14.818
He's a deserter.

19:15.646 --> 19:17.505
- What?
- Bastien. A deserter.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.616
I found this hidden in his things.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.586
Same regimental uniform
as the men we saw last night.

19:23.636 --> 19:25.606
He's working with the looters.

19:25.616 --> 19:27.446
Last night, when they ran,

19:27.471 --> 19:29.118
they left empty-handed.

19:29.143 --> 19:32.052
They took no food, no blankets, nothing.

19:32.694 --> 19:34.694
Maybe they came looking
for something else.

19:34.726 --> 19:36.666
Grimaud?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.655
Those men were desperate. I'd
say it's something they need.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.576
We split up.

19:41.586 --> 19:44.229
D'Artagnan and I continue
the search for Grimaud.

19:45.344 --> 19:46.823
You two deal with Bastien.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.931
What took you so long?

20:18.516 --> 20:19.636
What are you looking for?

20:19.646 --> 20:22.586
- I think you know.
- We gave you work.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.526
We thought you needed help.

20:25.626 --> 20:27.566
You found it in the caves, didn't you?

20:27.676 --> 20:28.685
Huh?

20:28.686 --> 20:29.904
Where is it now?

20:29.929 --> 20:31.296
Somewhere you'll never find it.

20:31.321 --> 20:32.686
We just want our property back.

20:32.696 --> 20:34.138
I'm afraid it's ours now.

20:34.163 --> 20:36.626
We paid for that gold with our blood!

20:36.636 --> 20:37.636
So did we.

20:50.688 --> 20:53.508
- Stop him!
- Stay where you are!

21:01.855 --> 21:02.810
Did you see that?

21:02.835 --> 21:04.586
- A figure.
- I don't know.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.536
- Was it him?
- I don't know.

21:07.437 --> 21:08.666
Go. Go!

21:28.706 --> 21:30.596
Bastien's a deserter.

21:30.606 --> 21:32.414
They're looking for something.
Do you know what it could be?

21:32.439 --> 21:35.686
We just want what is ours!

21:38.576 --> 21:39.969
Well put your weapons down!

21:40.706 --> 21:42.566
Then we can talk.

21:44.276 --> 21:45.356
All right.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.646
It's a trap!

21:55.716 --> 21:56.756
Kill her!

21:58.030 --> 21:59.371
Take cover!

22:25.656 --> 22:26.656
Pull back!

22:29.395 --> 22:30.799
Pull back!

22:32.307 --> 22:35.546
We'll be back to take what is ours!

23:18.277 --> 23:19.317
Ah.

23:35.666 --> 23:38.172
I'm going to ask you once.

23:38.205 --> 23:40.119
Are you working for Grimaud?

23:41.127 --> 23:42.416
Who?

23:42.441 --> 23:44.908
- You heard me.
- Don't know what you're talking about.

23:46.127 --> 23:47.916
We saw you running away last night,

23:48.254 --> 23:50.596
from the woman you'd just murdered.

23:53.044 --> 23:54.094
What were you after?

23:58.596 --> 24:00.875
Put him in a room with
Porthos. Ten minutes.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.498
Five would be enough.

24:04.505 --> 24:06.395
It's loot, isn't it?

24:06.420 --> 24:08.770
Isn't it stashed somewhere?
What is it? Hmm?

24:08.963 --> 24:09.983
Gold?

24:13.616 --> 24:16.725
You're the King's soldiers!
You killed women for this.

24:16.726 --> 24:19.775
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- It weren't me that killed her!

24:20.626 --> 24:22.606
She shouldn't have died.

24:23.289 --> 24:25.299
It's not what we...

24:25.324 --> 24:26.741
It's not what we agreed.

24:28.284 --> 24:31.403
I might be a thief but
I'm no woman-killer.

24:31.646 --> 24:34.979
I don't know what I expected from
a bunch of murderers and rapists.

24:37.445 --> 24:39.305
You're convicts?

24:39.330 --> 24:42.310
The army said we'd be spared
the noose if we'd fight.

24:42.997 --> 24:44.793
As if we had a choice in the matter.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.172
I'd rather have swung than all this.

24:48.726 --> 24:49.903
They didn't want soldiers.

24:49.928 --> 24:51.546
They just wanted

24:51.556 --> 24:53.586
meat to throw at the enemy's guns.

24:55.019 --> 24:56.521
We've seen things you
wouldn't believe men

24:56.546 --> 24:57.944
could do to other men.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.536
Oh believe me. We would.

25:04.497 --> 25:06.307
So you fled.

25:06.332 --> 25:07.615
We wanted to run for the border,

25:07.625 --> 25:10.663
but Bastien made us
come back for the gold.

25:10.688 --> 25:11.811
He said it was our only way out.

25:11.836 --> 25:13.321
And now we've got nothing else to show

25:13.346 --> 25:15.425
for four bastard years of war!

25:15.530 --> 25:17.529
But you don't remember
where you stashed it.

25:17.554 --> 25:18.554
Yeah we remember.

25:20.596 --> 25:21.656
In the caves.

25:22.626 --> 25:24.221
But it'd gone!

25:24.246 --> 25:26.316
Whatever you do to me,
they'll be back. They...

25:26.606 --> 25:27.626
Will not

25:27.636 --> 25:29.002
leave until they find it.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.606
They're broken.

25:39.616 --> 25:40.906
Low on ammunition.

25:41.483 --> 25:43.313
We can take them.

25:43.596 --> 25:45.655
Most dangerous kind of enemy.

25:45.656 --> 25:47.546
Ones with nothing left to lose.

26:06.138 --> 26:07.420
Who's that?

26:08.951 --> 26:10.318
Someone had to clear up the mess.

26:10.343 --> 26:12.262
His throat's been cut.
When did that happen?

26:12.765 --> 26:14.625
He attacked us.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.861
Athos is missing, his horse
came back riderless.

26:20.766 --> 26:22.706
He must be in the forest somewhere.

26:22.716 --> 26:24.867
Your friend shouldn't have
gone into the forest alone.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.408
I'm sorry.

27:36.433 --> 27:37.816
But I can't let you find him.

27:37.826 --> 27:42.636
You, you're protecting him.

27:42.646 --> 27:44.676
He was here and you are protecting him?

27:44.701 --> 27:47.327
I nursed a young man who might've died.

27:47.352 --> 27:48.455
Where is he?

27:48.480 --> 27:51.539
By the time your friends find you

27:51.696 --> 27:53.107
he'll be across the
other side of France.

27:53.132 --> 27:55.458
No, no, no, no. Do you
realise what you've done?

27:55.483 --> 27:57.452
He's a monster. Do you understand?

27:57.477 --> 27:58.527
He's evil.

28:00.736 --> 28:05.696
No. No, you are the one
who doesn't understand.

28:05.706 --> 28:08.563
I pulled him out of the
water, when he was a boy.

28:08.588 --> 28:10.633
When his own mother tried to drown him!

28:10.658 --> 28:13.701
She was such a sweet girl.

28:13.726 --> 28:14.905
Trusting.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.431
But she'd tried to make
friends with the soldiers.

28:17.456 --> 28:20.158
And then she was passed around them.

28:20.183 --> 28:21.686
They kept her tied up.

28:21.711 --> 28:24.847
Every time she tried to
escape she was flogged.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.676
By the time Lucien was born,
it was all she could do to

28:27.686 --> 28:29.731
drag him round like an animal.

28:29.756 --> 28:31.776
She was barely a child herself.

28:32.254 --> 28:37.164
I got him out of the water.
I raised him as best I could.

28:37.766 --> 28:41.686
Do you know, he didn't
even know how to cry.

28:41.696 --> 28:46.826
Do you think this changes a thing?

28:46.836 --> 28:52.078
Do you think this makes
any difference at all?

28:52.103 --> 28:53.942
I want you to unders...

28:53.967 --> 28:56.037
You should have left him to drown.

28:57.766 --> 29:01.706
You will never catch him.

29:01.716 --> 29:04.696
He's endured worse things
than you can even imagine.

29:04.706 --> 29:08.277
He's stronger than you. He's
smarter than you will ever be.

29:08.302 --> 29:11.626
You were outwitted by a woman.

29:42.716 --> 29:43.726
No!

29:45.581 --> 29:49.501
Do it. Do whatever you
like. I don't care any more.

29:55.736 --> 29:57.832
I've known soldiers like you before.

29:57.857 --> 29:59.934
And maybe you were good men once.

29:59.959 --> 30:02.504
But when you see so much
violence, it becomes the only

30:02.529 --> 30:04.455
thing you truly understand.

30:05.623 --> 30:06.733
I will find him,

30:08.646 --> 30:10.686
he shall face justice.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.469
I didn't want to do this...

30:13.494 --> 30:15.634
But you've given me no choice.

30:30.394 --> 30:31.976
- Athos!
- Athos!

30:32.816 --> 30:34.666
Athos!

30:35.507 --> 30:36.547
Athos!

30:39.493 --> 30:40.483
Athos!

30:40.508 --> 30:42.428
Let's split up. You three, with me.

30:42.453 --> 30:44.533
That boy didn't attack you, did he?

30:44.739 --> 30:46.877
You killed him because
he was after his gold.

30:47.836 --> 30:49.646
The gold you found.

30:49.656 --> 30:51.726
I'm right, aren't I?

30:54.233 --> 30:55.963
What has this war done to you?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.585
Taught me to survive.

31:01.836 --> 31:03.646
Athos!

31:08.796 --> 31:10.616
Athos!

31:10.806 --> 31:12.706
It was Therese.

31:13.426 --> 31:14.466
She fled.

31:17.766 --> 31:20.616
- Infection?
- Poison.

31:28.726 --> 31:29.884
Is there an antidote?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.616
What do we do now?

31:36.261 --> 31:38.271
Wait. And hope.

32:37.486 --> 32:38.664
No.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.636
No.

32:44.579 --> 32:46.369
Sylvie.

33:14.566 --> 33:15.606
Sylvie.

33:18.806 --> 33:20.596
No!

33:21.670 --> 33:23.580
Sylvie!

33:29.991 --> 33:31.001
Ah!

33:55.305 --> 33:57.385
I do not require my
wife's company today.

33:57.395 --> 33:58.415
Louis, please.

34:00.495 --> 34:03.295
We must prepare for all that is to come.

34:10.364 --> 34:13.364
Anne, who knows how long
I have left in this world.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.270
I do not intend to spend
it listening to your lies.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.460
I spent a night with Aramis.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.827
He is the father of our boy, by blood,

34:37.984 --> 34:38.984
but by blood alone.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.931
Everything he has known
and learnt and loved,

34:43.956 --> 34:44.967
has come from you.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.848
I cannot forgive you Anne.

34:50.465 --> 34:53.385
I will never be able to forgive you.

34:53.409 --> 34:55.762
I do not expect your forgiveness.

34:58.839 --> 35:00.789
We cannot change what has happened.

35:02.295 --> 35:04.345
But we can change how it is written.

35:10.305 --> 35:14.270
Name me as Regent.
And I swear to spend my life

35:14.295 --> 35:16.345
keeping your memory alive for him.

35:18.834 --> 35:23.700
I will write a history
worthy of you and your son.

35:25.392 --> 35:27.926
You ask too much.

36:00.295 --> 36:01.525
He's still very weak.

36:18.337 --> 36:20.217
Captain.

36:24.190 --> 36:27.415
You had bad dreams. About Grimaud.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.354
I learnt things from Therese
about what happened

36:32.379 --> 36:33.465
to him and his mother.

36:33.972 --> 36:35.096
She played us for fools,

36:35.121 --> 36:37.335
kept us here while he got
as far away as possible.

36:38.335 --> 36:39.898
He could be in Lorraine by now.

36:42.675 --> 36:44.675
Oh, you dreamt of Sylvie too.

37:24.752 --> 37:26.365
What do you want?

37:26.655 --> 37:28.735
Athos told me of Grimaud
and his mother, the...

37:30.557 --> 37:32.315
The things that happened to her.

37:34.247 --> 37:35.367
It's you, isn't it?

37:37.342 --> 37:40.333
Your friend, the girl whose
family disowned her.

37:44.157 --> 37:48.087
I imagine such an invention
makes memories easier to bear.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.267
I will shoot.

37:55.505 --> 37:59.415
Death will come slow.

37:59.425 --> 38:03.145
The gold. I want it brought out.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.067
All of it.

38:07.335 --> 38:09.491
- To the clearing in the forest.
- No.

38:10.325 --> 38:16.305
No, the village, where your
women are, your children.

38:17.653 --> 38:22.543
Try anything and I swear, they'll die.

38:23.345 --> 38:26.668
Tell Elodie. Get the strong box.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.116
Thank you.

38:38.808 --> 38:40.311
For what you did for Athos.

38:45.505 --> 38:47.365
What's it like,

38:50.305 --> 38:51.517
being on a battlefield?

39:01.365 --> 39:02.504
Cold.

39:03.587 --> 39:04.495
Muddy.

39:04.856 --> 39:06.736
Boring a lot of the time.

39:08.415 --> 39:10.305
You get used to it.

39:12.465 --> 39:14.335
Were you ever scared?

39:16.646 --> 39:17.646
No.

39:21.272 --> 39:23.171
It's Juliette...

39:23.425 --> 39:25.716
Make the exchange down by the smithy.

39:25.741 --> 39:27.305
We'll be up here for cover.

39:27.315 --> 39:28.375
We lose control of this,

39:28.385 --> 39:30.335
he'll kill everyone,
including the children.

39:39.305 --> 39:41.609
I'll be right next to you. All right?

39:42.568 --> 39:43.698
What we gonna do with him?

39:55.636 --> 39:58.436
Your friends have taken Juliette.

39:58.461 --> 39:59.551
You haven't got long.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.355
Go on and get it over with.

40:02.724 --> 40:03.854
I've had enough of waiting to die.

40:10.455 --> 40:12.405
We're all afraid of dying.

40:14.167 --> 40:17.057
The trick is just to find
something worth dying for.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.717
It's too late for that.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.236
I saw you before, with Elodie.

40:22.261 --> 40:24.051
You could have killed her,
but you didn't.

40:29.787 --> 40:33.717
If we give you this weapon,
will you fight with us?

40:54.325 --> 40:57.173
Try anything, you're gonna find out

40:57.198 --> 40:58.335
I'm not as nice as her.

40:58.345 --> 41:00.056
Yeah.

41:06.667 --> 41:09.507
We're all afraid of dying.

41:09.532 --> 41:11.542
I've heard people say it.

41:15.612 --> 41:17.622
I want you all to listen to Elodie.

41:18.695 --> 41:20.635
Do exactly what she says.

41:22.595 --> 41:25.545
Get them all into the caves.
Block the entrances.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.625
We know what we're doing.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.685
So do we.

41:40.519 --> 41:43.528
Queens have been beheaded for less.

41:43.529 --> 41:46.499
And yet no king has been
beheaded for such a crime.

41:50.163 --> 41:52.825
Your Majesty, may I offer some advice?

41:52.850 --> 41:53.850
No.

42:00.811 --> 42:02.751
Make your peace with her,

42:06.519 --> 42:07.887
before it's too late.

42:19.509 --> 42:20.579
You all right?

42:21.589 --> 42:22.689
Mm-hmm.

42:22.699 --> 42:24.539
I'll be right behind you.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.579
Weapons on the ground.

42:58.439 --> 43:00.419
Hands where we can see them.

43:10.669 --> 43:12.579
The baby's coming.

43:53.167 --> 43:54.768
- Come on!
- Ha!

44:39.589 --> 44:41.559
Have you ever seen a birth?

44:43.406 --> 44:44.576
Grew up in a slum.

44:45.649 --> 44:47.479
Neighbour had ten children.

44:50.689 --> 44:52.649
How many of them survived?

44:56.410 --> 44:57.579
That's it.

45:18.649 --> 45:19.649
Cut the ropes!

47:09.619 --> 47:12.289
- Relax. Breathe.
- I can't do it. I can't do it.

47:12.314 --> 47:13.564
Yes you can.

47:13.589 --> 47:15.529
Yes you can...

47:15.539 --> 47:20.639
Elodie, Elodie! Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

47:21.659 --> 47:24.499
I know a lot about fear.

47:24.509 --> 47:27.539
You asked me if I've ever been
scared on the battlefield.

47:29.699 --> 47:31.589
Well I was.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.609
When I was on the
front line at one point,

47:34.619 --> 47:37.599
we were losing more men
than we could bury.

47:39.239 --> 47:41.229
Seeing things like that,

47:42.765 --> 47:45.795
it does something to your
mind, fear takes over.

47:47.539 --> 47:49.559
One night it got so bad,

47:51.372 --> 47:52.462
I left.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.623
I got five miles away.
Then I realised what I was

47:56.648 --> 47:58.004
doing and I came back.

47:59.669 --> 48:00.769
No one ever knew.

48:03.489 --> 48:04.941
Why did you come back?

48:06.559 --> 48:07.569
My men.

48:09.699 --> 48:11.619
My friends, I...

48:13.831 --> 48:17.108
However bad it gets
you keep going for them,

48:17.133 --> 48:20.997
for Juliette, for your
people, now your baby.

48:21.599 --> 48:22.659
You don't give up.

48:24.887 --> 48:26.907
Fear has no power over you.

48:50.719 --> 48:52.599
What did you spend it all on?

48:52.609 --> 48:55.539
This! On a home for us.

48:55.549 --> 48:57.629
What a waste that turned out to be.

49:54.777 --> 49:56.159
Will you have a drink with me?

50:06.681 --> 50:09.671
I was never expecting love, Anne.

50:12.867 --> 50:16.767
Our union was nothing
to do with you or I.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.743
France married Spain.

50:22.307 --> 50:24.112
But we began as friends, didn't we?

50:32.937 --> 50:34.837
Can we not end that way?

50:38.927 --> 50:41.200
The Bourbon blood dies with me.

50:46.646 --> 50:48.656
But the Bourbon line does not.

50:51.947 --> 50:54.727
Our son will never be anything else.

50:56.837 --> 50:58.787
I swear it.

51:00.937 --> 51:02.727
I will name you.

51:06.287 --> 51:08.847
After I am dead
you will never speak of this.

51:25.937 --> 51:28.867
Carrying this secret
will be your punishment.

52:01.787 --> 52:02.867
What are you going to do now?

52:04.894 --> 52:05.894
Grow crops.

52:07.144 --> 52:08.787
Raise my daughter.

52:10.737 --> 52:11.737
On your own?

52:13.927 --> 52:15.877
I could stay for a while. Help.

52:27.877 --> 52:29.292
Thank you.

52:32.927 --> 52:35.707
But France needs men like you.

52:40.541 --> 52:41.832
More than we do.

53:01.927 --> 53:03.777
Do you have children of your own?

53:10.345 --> 53:11.538
Shame.

53:12.210 --> 53:13.828
You'd have made a good father.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.945
In another life, perhaps.

53:22.664 --> 53:26.882
I made myself forget what
happened, for years,

53:26.907 --> 53:29.777
it seemed like it happened
to someone else.

53:51.610 --> 53:55.630
Well, well. There's a beating
heart there after all.

53:55.655 --> 53:57.735
Behave yourself.

53:58.119 --> 54:00.887
Yes, this is all very
romantic, gentlemen,

54:00.897 --> 54:02.325
but we do have work to do.
