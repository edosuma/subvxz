"Sumo scootz!"

00:35.335 --> 00:36.927
Vroom! Vroom!

00:37.003 --> 00:38.300
Reee!

00:39.272 --> 00:40.170
Winner!

00:40.240 --> 00:41.070
Whoo!

00:41.141 --> 00:42.938
79th consecutive victory!

00:43.009 --> 00:46.172
In your face!

00:46.246 --> 00:47.246
You okay, buddy?

00:48.181 --> 00:50.274
Still bummed out about
Flame Princess?

00:50.350 --> 00:52.011
Hmm.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.781
I know what'll fix you up.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.014
Girls' night out, boy style.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.556
First, we'll go to the salon,

00:57.624 --> 00:59.135
get your hair did and
your nails all...

00:59.159 --> 01:00.159
Wait, no.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.524
First, we'll go to the shops,

01:01.594 --> 01:02.856
get you a brand-new hat.

01:02.929 --> 01:03.929
Then we'll...

01:05.031 --> 01:07.261
A burglermur!

01:11.204 --> 01:12.228
The Ice King?!

01:12.305 --> 01:13.135
Grr!

01:13.206 --> 01:14.332
Ugh.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.999
Geez, you couldn't
wait two seconds?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.076
Ugh.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.508
Why are you stinking
up our house?

01:18.578 --> 01:19.738
Didn't you get my text?

01:19.813 --> 01:20.990
It said I'm staying
with you guys... oh.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.140
Didn't go through.

01:22.215 --> 01:23.559
Well, anyways, I knew
you wouldn't mind,

01:23.583 --> 01:25.983
since it's sort of your
fault I'm homeless, right?

01:26.052 --> 01:27.485
Right.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.250
'Cause you tricked your crazy ex
into melting my Ice Kingdom...

01:30.323 --> 01:31.517
Mm-hmm.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.819
With your lies and secrets.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.325
Remember when that happened?

01:34.394 --> 01:36.305
Dude, you can't stay here
if you're gonna stank it up

01:36.329 --> 01:38.627
with your bad vibes, man.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.862
Yeah, I'm just crashing here
while the penguins rebuild.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.631
I've given Gunter
temporary reign.

01:49.542 --> 01:50.668
Should be fine.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.438
Flame Princess isn't crazy.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.740
You're blind, Finn.

01:53.813 --> 01:54.813
You're blind!

01:54.881 --> 01:55.779
Wait, she isn't here, is she?

01:55.849 --> 01:56.679
No.

01:56.749 --> 01:57.807
Whew!

01:57.884 --> 02:00.614
She said she wanted
time to herself.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.551
Yeesh!

02:01.621 --> 02:03.213
Yeah. Breakups are tough.

02:03.289 --> 02:06.190
Heh. Yeah, like remember how
you and I were married?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.301
Ugh! It's so confusing!

02:17.370 --> 02:19.736
Hmm?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.775
I thought Finn was a
stand-up guy, you know?

02:22.842 --> 02:25.811
But he basically betrayed me.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.279
Why do people even have secrets?

02:28.348 --> 02:31.374
It's like that in the
Fire Kingdom, too.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.079
Everyone is all deceitful
and Shakespeare.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.452
But out here, it doesn't
seem any different.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.491
Why do I have to feel like this?

02:39.592 --> 02:41.150
And what is that noise?!

02:41.227 --> 02:42.421
Gah!

02:45.198 --> 02:46.563
- Unh.
- Eee!

02:47.734 --> 02:48.734
Yeah, yeah.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.292
Just act like I'm not here.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.133
Are you spying on me?!

02:52.205 --> 02:53.103
What?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.437
No, of course not.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.877
I was observing
you for research.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.280
You're a threat, Flame Princess.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.840
Your emotions are
directly linked

03:05.919 --> 03:07.386
to your combustion levels.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.513
But if I can create a scientific
model that describes your

03:10.590 --> 03:11.955
complete elemental matrix,

03:12.025 --> 03:16.428
I can isolate and suppress
your more volatile traits.

03:16.496 --> 03:20.296
So, if you do your research,
you'll know how to cut off my

03:20.366 --> 03:22.834
emotions so I won't
feel like this?

03:22.902 --> 03:24.267
Um, yeah.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.235
Basically.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.135
Then I'll help you.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.036
You will?

03:27.106 --> 03:28.038
Yes.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.574
I'll do whatever it takes.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.737
Once I press this button,
you'll be subjected

03:32.779 --> 03:35.839
to a battery of tests to gauge
your reflexes, stamina,

03:35.915 --> 03:38.816
and your reaction to
various emotional stimuli.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.944
This is going to help
me understand myself?

03:41.020 --> 03:44.217
There's a 40% chance we'll
be able to identify

03:44.290 --> 03:47.350
and isolate your chemical
components and, yes,

03:47.427 --> 03:50.362
understand you in a
very scientific way.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.990
Oh, that's good... I guess.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.034
Initiate tests.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.101
Yah!

03:56.135 --> 03:57.135
Hello?

03:57.203 --> 04:00.195
Princess, we need you and your
ball blam burglerbur right away!

04:00.273 --> 04:02.867
Gunter has created a race of
strangling snow snakes or

04:02.942 --> 04:04.739
"Snow-a-constrictors!"

04:04.811 --> 04:06.073
Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:06.145 --> 04:07.237
Yahhhh!

04:15.588 --> 04:17.146
Okay, Cinnamon Bun,

04:17.223 --> 04:19.783
all you have to do is
write down the numbers

04:19.858 --> 04:21.690
that appear on this monitor.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.524
Can you do that one thing?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.393
Yes.

04:25.465 --> 04:27.592
Oh, one other thing.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.033
Do <i>not</i> open that door.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.329
So that's two things.

04:33.406 --> 04:34.930
Write down the numbers.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.703
Do not open that door.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.606
Got it?

04:37.677 --> 04:38.939
Yes, Princess.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.209
Hello.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.343
Hello.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.477
You look sad.

04:47.553 --> 04:48.485
Yeah.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.578
But mostly I'm confused.

04:50.556 --> 04:51.386
Me too.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.287
Really?

04:52.358 --> 04:53.188
Yeah.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.624
Bubblegum is bad.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.694
She is?

04:55.728 --> 04:56.922
I don't know.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.463
Want to pet my dog?!

04:58.531 --> 04:59.930
He lives at my house.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.591
What about the tests?

05:01.668 --> 05:03.795
I'm not good at tests.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.804
♪ La-de-da-de-da ♪

05:07.674 --> 05:10.438
His name is Jake, but
he's not the real Jake.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.977
Oh. My body is soft.

05:19.285 --> 05:21.150
We're friends.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.050
Yeah.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.213
I really get you.

05:23.289 --> 05:25.553
But sometimes friends
are hard to understand.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.115
Sometimes you think
you know them,

05:27.193 --> 05:29.559
but you find out they're
just playing mind games.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.426
Is the Princess your friend?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.055
I don't know.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.465
Yeah, because why did she
lock you up in jail when you

05:36.536 --> 05:38.094
were a little baby?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.139
That was a weird friend thing.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.667
The word! The word!

05:44.744 --> 05:46.211
What's the word?

05:46.279 --> 05:49.339
The word is your newborn baby
will have greater powers

05:49.415 --> 05:51.076
than you'll ever dream of!

05:51.150 --> 05:52.708
Uh...

05:52.785 --> 05:55.253
have my baby sent into the
wilderness of the outside world

05:55.321 --> 05:56.618
to perish.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.781
Okay!

06:00.660 --> 06:02.127
Ah!

06:02.195 --> 06:03.025
Oh.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.621
Hup.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.995
Ah!

06:07.066 --> 06:08.931
Aw.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.075
Ho ho!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.219
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

06:37.263 --> 06:38.787
Castle!

06:38.865 --> 06:41.060
What's this?

06:45.037 --> 06:46.561
A Princess?

06:46.639 --> 06:48.038
Must have wandered off.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.569
Flame King!

06:50.643 --> 06:52.975
What do you want, Princess
of the Gum World?

06:53.045 --> 06:55.172
I found your lost daughter.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.512
I-I don't remember
losing anything.

06:58.684 --> 06:59.946
Okay, you got me.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.680
I had her sent to
wander in the woods.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.120
I was in fear of being usurped.
Come on.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.452
That's your problem.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.789
But you can't just let her
run around the woods.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.589
She's too dangerous.

07:09.662 --> 07:13.223
Find some way to contain
her power or I will.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.358
Fine.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.230
Ugh!

07:20.306 --> 07:22.604
Is everybody in this
world hiding something?

07:22.675 --> 07:24.142
It's fun to hide.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.201
You're all right.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.713
Why can't everybody
be honest like you?

07:28.781 --> 07:31.011
Maybe I should just go
back where I belong.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.083
Wait!

07:32.118 --> 07:33.415
Do you mean baby jail?

07:33.486 --> 07:35.044
I don't know, man.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.452
Mm...

07:37.590 --> 07:40.081
Fighting Snow-a-constrictors
really helped take my mind

07:40.159 --> 07:41.319
off things.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.157
So, uh, why am I here, again?

07:45.231 --> 07:46.994
Oh, I just wanted to
measure Flame Princess's

07:47.066 --> 07:50.832
reaction when confronted by
the guy who broke her heart.

07:52.438 --> 07:53.803
Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm...

07:57.777 --> 08:00.143
Cinnamon Bun!

08:04.050 --> 08:05.517
There's a note.

08:05.585 --> 08:09.919
"Gone to Fire Kingdom.
Please watch dog."

08:09.989 --> 08:11.115
Well, this is terrible.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.521
If Flame Princess
goes back there,

08:12.592 --> 08:14.219
her evil Dad will
lock her up again.

08:14.293 --> 08:15.658
And if she's imprisoned,

08:15.728 --> 08:17.491
I won't be able to
complete my tests

08:17.563 --> 08:19.588
and I'll have wasted
my precious time!

08:19.665 --> 08:20.723
We got to save her.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.665
Let's doogie!

08:25.438 --> 08:27.015
State your business here,
and be quick about it.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.666
Sorry.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.652
I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried
that Jerry here will find out

08:30.676 --> 08:32.667
I'm dating his sister.

08:32.745 --> 08:35.736
Listen, we need to get
into the castle right now.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.282
Yeah, but why?

08:38.618 --> 08:40.142
So I can go to
your mama's house!

08:40.219 --> 08:41.777
Now get out of my way.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.947
Doesn't your mom live
in a nursing home?

08:44.023 --> 08:44.887
Yeah.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.015
And in a different city.

08:46.092 --> 08:46.922
Come on, dude.

08:46.993 --> 08:47.925
You got to be honest here.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.291
Honest my fist!

08:51.163 --> 08:52.163
Come on, Princess.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.558
Oh, yeah!

08:55.635 --> 08:58.729
Gonna scramble you and
fry you up for brunch!

08:58.804 --> 09:02.205
I'm trying to act tough, but I
really wanted to be a chef.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.799
Man.

09:03.876 --> 09:04.876
Halt.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.172
What is your business here?

09:06.245 --> 09:08.270
I need to get inside
to file my taxes.

09:08.347 --> 09:10.315
Also, I like using
the bathroom here.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.317
Also, I like to crop
dust the lobby.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.478
Pass, friend.

09:17.156 --> 09:17.986
All right.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.422
So, you want to get nasty?

09:19.492 --> 09:22.222
One time I blew a snot bubble
that broke off and floated away.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.819
Then it some lady's
baby in the face,

09:23.896 --> 09:25.056
and it started crying.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.032
And I really enjoy the
taste of envelopes.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.398
Uh, that's cool and all,
but you still haven't

09:30.469 --> 09:31.993
told us why you want to get in.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.698
We need to see the King?

09:33.773 --> 09:35.604
Well, why didn't
you just say so?

09:35.675 --> 09:38.007
Right this way, friends.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.306
Here you go.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.904
The new Flame King.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.347
Flame Princess?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.417
Finn?

09:45.451 --> 09:47.544
You're okay!

09:47.620 --> 09:49.178
Um, how's it going?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.552
Pretty good.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.592
Cinnamon Bun and I staged a
coup and overthrew my Dad.

09:53.659 --> 09:57.026
Oh, that's why the
guards were wigging out.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.929
That is the new way
in Fire Kingdom.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.194
Total honesty is the
law of the land.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.292
No secrets.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.369
Oh.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.030
Right. Can you believe
this nonsense?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.369
Once I get out of here, I'm
gonna ground you for real.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.308
No snacks, no friends,
no popular music.

10:11.377 --> 10:13.777
You never let me have
any of those things!

10:13.846 --> 10:17.145
You were a selfish
King and a bad parent.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.877
But I did it for you, honey.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.751
For you not to overthrow
me like you just did.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.219
You belong in that lamp!

10:22.288 --> 10:23.812
And if you don't settle down,

10:23.889 --> 10:25.447
you'll have to answer
to Cinnamon Bun.

10:25.524 --> 10:26.524
Hi.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.354
Wow.

10:29.428 --> 10:31.760
She's even awesomer
than I remember.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.765
Take off that silly hat.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.232
We're going home.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.393
No. Look!

10:36.469 --> 10:37.731
Got a real dog now.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.971
Flame Princess, listen, I'm
really sorry I lied and

10:42.041 --> 10:44.305
hurt your feelings, and
I was a big, fat jerk.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.810
Finn, it's okay.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.368
It's in the past now.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.141
So, does that mean
we're still going out?

10:49.215 --> 10:50.477
No.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.177
I've realized my place is
here ruling these weak

10:53.252 --> 10:54.947
and vicious fire people.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.352
I see.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.521
But we're cool.

10:58.591 --> 11:01.321
You're welcome to come back and
hang out whenever you like

11:01.394 --> 11:03.225
if you promise me one thing.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.557
Anything.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.825
That you'll be completely
honest with me.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.630
Okay.

11:08.701 --> 11:09.701
I promise.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.503
I'm serious.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.570
Hmm.
