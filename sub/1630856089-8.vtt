16:16.880 --> 16:17.960
[groaning]

16:19.240 --> 16:20.720
[panting]

16:29.240 --> 16:30.520
[knocking at door]

16:30.520 --> 16:31.440
Ma'am?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.480
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

16:35.480 --> 16:37.200
Ma'am? Help!

16:37.200 --> 16:39.280
[opera music fades out]

17:15.760 --> 17:16.880
[man 1] Thank you.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.000
[man 2] That's okay.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.360
Yes.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.400
[men grunting lightly]

17:33.640 --> 17:39.120
The doctor saw instantly
that I'd had another stroke,

17:39.120 --> 17:43.840
but that, as it turns out,
was the least of my problems.

17:43.840 --> 17:49.680
Because even after he'd... stabilized me
with a cocktail of drugs,

17:49.680 --> 17:52.760
the soles of my feet were so burnt,

17:52.760 --> 17:56.840
it meant I couldn't stand,
never mind walk.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.800
Then why didn't you come home sooner?

17:58.800 --> 18:03.240
Because all manner
of humiliating preparations

18:03.240 --> 18:04.760
needed to be made.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.400
The car had to be specially modified.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.400
Handrails put all over the place

18:14.400 --> 18:16.920
like a home for geriatrics.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.800
I don't have handrails anywhere.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.480
[Margaret] Now I'm back,

18:21.480 --> 18:25.920
the doctors want to use leeches on my feet

18:25.920 --> 18:28.240
as an... as an ant--

18:29.040 --> 18:30.280
an ant--

18:30.800 --> 18:33.480
anticoagulant.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.600
Her voice is a little odd.
What is she saying?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.200
I think it was "anticoagulant."

18:37.200 --> 18:42.720
They've given me
these Velcro slippers instead of shoes.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.840
Gone are the days of heels!

18:45.720 --> 18:49.120
Gone are the days of feet,
for that matter.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.840
Why not try some gentle exercise?

18:53.440 --> 18:58.080
You could use the Palace pool.
Exercise can help with moods too.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.600
[Margaret] I'd rather die
than do exercise.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
And,

19:03.200 --> 19:05.960
seeing as
I'm going to be dead soon anyway,

19:06.560 --> 19:09.560
I thought I might as well
go out with a bang.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.080
It's my 70th birthday this year,

19:14.080 --> 19:19.000
and I've decided I want to celebrate it
with a nice, big party.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.120
What?

19:20.120 --> 19:21.720
[Margaret] At the Ritz.

19:22.760 --> 19:26.360
Because we love the Ritz.
Don't we, Lilibet?

19:27.640 --> 19:28.480
Do we?

19:28.480 --> 19:29.560
[Margaret] We do.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.760
We have such special memories.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.240
[Margaret chuckles softly]

19:36.360 --> 19:39.720
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

19:40.400 --> 19:43.560
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

19:44.480 --> 19:45.840
Have I missed something?

19:45.840 --> 19:48.640
[Margaret humming]

19:48.640 --> 19:50.720
- [horns honking]
- [crowd cheering]

19:52.880 --> 19:55.720
[overlapping chattering and shouting]

19:55.720 --> 19:59.000
Look at how I'm dressed.
Do you think they will let us in?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.840
Of course. Just tell them who you are.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.960
That is the one thing
I am not going to do.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.280
Then you're going to have to
bat your eyelids a little.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.240
[Elizabeth huffs]

20:08.120 --> 20:09.080
Go on.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.160
- [horns honking]
- [men laughing]

20:18.360 --> 20:20.360
[doorman] Evening, miss. Through you go!

20:23.040 --> 20:25.040
- Ah...
- Oh. Uh... [chuckles]

20:25.040 --> 20:26.720
- I--
- Only pulling your leg, sir.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.640
[both chuckle]

20:27.640 --> 20:28.720
- Thank you.
- In you go.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.640
[lively jazz tune playing]

20:30.640 --> 20:31.880
Will you look at that.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.200
Well, what do we do now?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.960
[Elizabeth] Dive in, I suppose.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.760
[overlapping chatter]

20:48.200 --> 20:49.360
- Miss.
- Yes, please.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.080
Cheers, big ears.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.720
- Cheers!
- [men laughing]

21:12.920 --> 21:15.560
[playing lively tune]

21:16.160 --> 21:17.800
[both chuckling]

21:21.760 --> 21:23.640
I'm going to put this in the cloakroom.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.480
- Oh, let me escort you.
- No need.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.600
[attendant] Hello, miss.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.040
- Pass you that.
- Thanks.

21:43.360 --> 21:44.400
[softly] Whoa.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.720
Excuse me, ma'am.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.000
Sorry. Have a nice evening.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.120
Wait. Don't go up there.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.120
[chuckles] Come with us.

21:54.920 --> 21:55.840
Way more fun.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.080
[chuckles]

22:13.240 --> 22:15.240
[upbeat jazz tune playing]

22:20.240 --> 22:22.200
I wouldn't go down there if I were you.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.760
Americans.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.040
Ever heard of the jitterbug?

22:26.560 --> 22:29.160
- I know about the doodlebug.
- It's a dance.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.320
Banned here. And with good reason.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.840
- It comes from Harlem.
- From where?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.480
A ghetto. In New York.

22:38.880 --> 22:39.720
Wait.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.800
Don't I recognize you?

22:42.480 --> 22:43.600
No, I don't think so.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.480
[Philip] Right.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.480
I'll be off.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.360
- Will you make my apologies?
- I will.

22:58.360 --> 23:02.480
[Philip] And wish the birthday girl
a very happy birthday.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.840
I will.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.120
You taking anyone?

23:05.680 --> 23:08.040
Anne. And Porchey will be there.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.000
Ah. Good old Porchey.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.400
Yes, good old Porchey.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.360
Always good company, never lets one down.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.240
Is everything all right?

23:23.120 --> 23:23.960
Sorry.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.280
I just find myself
worrying about Margaret all the time.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.920
Oh, well, hasn't it always been like that?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.000
- Yes.
- Hm.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.160
I suppose it has.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
[somber music playing]

23:59.360 --> 24:00.320
[Margaret] Mm.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.000
[exhales deeply]

24:04.640 --> 24:06.760
- [Margaret inhales sharply]
- Sorry, ma'am.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.840
[Margaret] Mm.

24:08.840 --> 24:09.920
Go on.

24:10.760 --> 24:11.920
[moans softly]

24:17.360 --> 24:18.280
[exhales]

24:20.200 --> 24:22.200
[exhales forcefully, inhales sharply]

24:23.520 --> 24:25.760
- [cameras clicking]
- [indistinct chattering]

24:28.600 --> 24:30.680
- [cameras clicking]
- [overlapping chatter]

24:32.720 --> 24:33.880
[man 1] Margaret!

24:33.880 --> 24:35.920
- [man 2] Do you need a hand, ma'am?
- I'm all right.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.160
- [man 1] How are you feeling now, ma'am?
- Have you recovered, Your Royal Highness?

24:39.160 --> 24:41.520
[man 1] Are you still
smoking cigarettes, ma'am?

24:42.560 --> 24:44.080
[woman] How are you feeling?

24:45.360 --> 24:47.360
[overlapping conversations]

24:54.000 --> 24:56.480
- I just wish you were there.
- Yeah, I know.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.040
[glass clinking]

24:58.040 --> 25:00.000
[chair scraping]

25:03.320 --> 25:06.160
Thank you all for coming this evening.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.000
As you know,

25:10.720 --> 25:17.280
I've spent much of my time recently
lying in hospital beds

25:18.400 --> 25:20.480
or sitting in wheelchairs,

25:21.360 --> 25:24.400
staring out of windows at that

25:25.920 --> 25:30.240
little patch of blue
that prisoners call the sky.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.040
[light laughter]

25:32.560 --> 25:33.440
But

25:35.080 --> 25:36.080
one thing that...

25:38.120 --> 25:40.440
throughout it all sustained me.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.160
- Memories.
- [guests] Mm.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.720
As it turns out, I have

25:50.560 --> 25:56.000
rather fond memories
of quite a few evenings at the Ritz...

25:56.000 --> 25:58.080
- [crowd laughing]
- [Margaret chuckles]

25:58.080 --> 26:00.240
...that I'd like to share with you.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.840
One, in particular,

26:03.600 --> 26:05.000
comes to mind,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.200
when a very different side

26:08.200 --> 26:13.120
of the young Princess Elizabeth
was revealed.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.200
[guests chattering]

26:16.680 --> 26:19.120
And I'm sure
everyone would love to hear about that.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.040
Yes, they would, Lilibet,

26:22.040 --> 26:23.800
which is why I'm telling it.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.360
It would miss the point entirely
of why we're all here tonight.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.160
To celebrate <i>you.</i>

26:29.160 --> 26:31.040
- Hear, hear.
- [guests clapping]

26:33.040 --> 26:34.000
[chuckles dryly]

26:34.800 --> 26:38.440
As a child, I felt sorry for children
who didn't have a brother or a sister.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.840
From the day she was born,

26:41.640 --> 26:44.920
Margaret Rose has been
my constant companion.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.160
Rarely able to see other children,
we relied on one another, and,

26:51.040 --> 26:53.480
like Juno's swans, we were inseparable.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.440
- [guests exclaim]
- [Margaret chuckles]

26:55.440 --> 26:57.360
We... we shared a room,

26:58.480 --> 27:01.480
wore the same clothes,
enjoyed the same activities.

27:02.840 --> 27:03.880
In particular,

27:04.560 --> 27:08.080
managing our collection
of wooden horses on wheels...

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
[light laughter]

27:09.080 --> 27:12.720
...that we would groom and water and race.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.240
[Margaret chuckles] True.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.080
And whenever we got into trouble,

27:16.880 --> 27:21.120
Margaret would blame everything
on her imaginary friend, Cousin Halifax.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.080
Oh, yes, I would.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.040
No, there really wasn't anything
Cousin Halifax wouldn't do.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.400
Sounding the air raid bell
to wake the guards.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.280
Hiding the gardener's tools.
He really was very mischievous.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.840
[light chuckling]

27:37.960 --> 27:39.680
It's not always easy,

27:40.480 --> 27:43.600
growing up in a family
where one person has to wear the crown,

27:44.320 --> 27:46.080
being the number two.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.360
[gentle music playing]

27:47.360 --> 27:51.400
But Margaret has been my ally,
day in, day out.

27:52.320 --> 27:55.000
And that is the person
I wanted to tell you about tonight.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.080
Not the dazzling,
you all know that already.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.600
[guests exclaim quietly]

27:59.600 --> 28:00.680
But the dutiful.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.680
Never wavering.

28:04.840 --> 28:08.000
My lifelong companion and support

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
without whom...

28:16.120 --> 28:17.000
well...

28:20.440 --> 28:21.960
it would be unimaginable.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.640
Dearest Margaret...

28:28.480 --> 28:30.640
many happy returns.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.520
[woman] Happy birthday, Margaret.

28:34.520 --> 28:38.000
- Happy birthday, Margaret.
- Happy birthday.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.280
I don't know
whether to be touched or cross.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.080
[Elizabeth] <i>Why?</i>

28:45.080 --> 28:48.120
I've always wanted to
sing your praises in public.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.160
Well,

28:49.760 --> 28:52.680
it was both uncalled for

28:52.680 --> 28:54.640
and rather thrilling.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.320
Everyone is being so nice.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.600
One should be seriously ill more often.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.120
[coughing harshly]

29:03.760 --> 29:06.720
Listen to that cough.
You haven't started smoking again?

29:07.240 --> 29:09.520
[coughs] No, of course not.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.560
That was

29:12.640 --> 29:14.160
Cousin Halifax.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.240
[both chuckling]

29:18.400 --> 29:20.040
Good night, Lilibet.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.120
<i>Good night.</i>

29:21.960 --> 29:23.240
[receiver clatters]

29:27.680 --> 29:29.680
- Mm.
- [high-pitched ringing]

29:30.640 --> 29:32.640
[groaning deeply]

29:36.760 --> 29:37.600
Oh...

29:39.400 --> 29:40.480
[sighs, sniffs]

29:42.560 --> 29:43.600
[exhales sharply]

29:45.920 --> 29:47.440
Oh... [grunts]

29:48.440 --> 29:49.360
[exhales]

30:10.920 --> 30:14.400
- [high-pitched ringing intensifies]
- [breathing shakily]

30:16.000 --> 30:17.680
[moans softly]

30:19.200 --> 30:20.440
Oh... [inhales sharply]

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
Mm...

30:26.920 --> 30:28.680
Mm... [gasps softly]

30:29.280 --> 30:30.920
[shouts]

30:30.920 --> 30:33.000
[high-pitched ringing continues]

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
[high-pitched ringing fades out]

31:18.640 --> 31:19.480
Hello, you.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.640
[weakly] Mm.

31:27.520 --> 31:30.080
And... goodbye, you.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.080
Stop it.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.280
We'll have you up
and out of here in no time.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.360
No.

31:37.880 --> 31:42.080
I'm afraid it's... serious this time.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.120
I can feel it.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.280
Or can't feel it, more like.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.720
I can't feel anything.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.640
Or see anything.
