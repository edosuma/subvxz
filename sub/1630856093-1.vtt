00:01.167 --> 00:04.571
(dramatic music)

00:05.372 --> 00:08.341
(scary music)

00:20.553 --> 00:23.156
(bright music)

00:31.164 --> 00:34.100
(static crackling)

00:43.743 --> 00:46.513
(Onyx exhales)

00:46.513 --> 00:48.248
- Greetings, oh masterful one.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.250
I am but a lowly minion
sitting here before you

00:50.250 --> 00:53.753
crisscross applesauce,
consummately at your

00:53.753 --> 00:56.890
infernal service and forever
in your eternal debt.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.358
I dunno.

00:58.358 --> 01:01.194
My name is Marcus J.
Trillbury, but my friends,

01:01.194 --> 01:06.199
my many, many friends call
me Onyx the Fortuitous,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.902
slayer of the bright realm.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.271
I dunno.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.806
I have been a devilish devotee
of yours

01:12.806 --> 01:14.407
for more years than I can
count.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.943
I have purchased all of your
books.

01:16.943 --> 01:18.945
Huh. Interesting.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.414
Listened to all of your
records.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.917
And even attempted to complete
your at-home workout regime,

01:23.917 --> 01:26.052
"The Beelzebub Beef Up."

01:26.052 --> 01:28.221
But most importantly, I've
been a diligent student

01:28.221 --> 01:30.256
of your teachings, having
completed the online

01:30.256 --> 01:32.559
certification process for
Letting a Lil Devil In,

01:32.559 --> 01:35.395
levels 101, 201, and 301.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.997
And I was approved for
401, but my mom said

01:37.997 --> 01:40.200
I had to stop spending money
on the internet, full stop.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.202
And yes, that did include
bidding on rare

01:42.202 --> 01:44.871
Battle K.A.T.T.S. minifigs,
even though last summer I was

01:44.871 --> 01:47.774
this close to winning a
glow-in-the-dark, ultra blue

01:47.774 --> 01:51.744
pumaman variant. Goddamn, I
wanted that minifig so bad.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.314
So when I heard, oh Lord, that
you were running a contest

01:54.314 --> 01:56.749
for five of your most devoted
followers to take part

01:56.749 --> 02:00.019
in a once-in-a-lifetime demonic
ritual with you in person,

02:00.019 --> 02:02.856
I just knew it was my destiny
to attend.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.658
For I am the most devoted
of darkened disciples,

02:05.658 --> 02:07.494
the most fiery of fervent
fanatics,

02:07.494 --> 02:09.829
and the most perpetuitous
of putrid pupils.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.967
I guess the only thing left
to say is,

02:13.967 --> 02:16.202
notice me, Senpai, notice me!
(door bangs)

02:16.202 --> 02:17.670
Oh, God, Mom.
- What the hell

02:17.670 --> 02:18.705
are you doing in here?
- I told you I was making

02:18.705 --> 02:19.839
a video.
- Are those my dolls?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.040
- They're for the video
- Did you

02:21.040 --> 02:22.242
rip my dolls' heads off?
- I promise I'll put

02:22.242 --> 02:23.776
them back, but you can't take
them now.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.646
You'll disrupt the magick!
You'll disrupt the magick!

02:26.646 --> 02:29.382
(dramatic music)

02:34.187 --> 02:37.323
(ethereal vocalizing)

02:41.661 --> 02:45.098
(computer keys clacking)

02:54.541 --> 02:57.877
(Onyx inhales and exhales)

02:59.245 --> 03:01.981
(computer trills)

03:06.019 --> 03:08.321
(door squeaks)

03:08.321 --> 03:11.424
(Todd laughing)

03:11.424 --> 03:14.093
(fork thudding)

03:15.061 --> 03:20.066
- [Todd] Oh my God. (laughing)

03:25.038 --> 03:28.107
- Did you put everything
back where you found it?

03:28.107 --> 03:29.409
- Yes, Mom.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.512
- Even Holly Little Puddin'
Pants?

03:32.512 --> 03:34.547
- Even Holly Little Puddin'
Pants. Woo!

03:35.715 --> 03:38.518
- Where you headed? You
don't work on Fridays.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.320
- Oh, thanks for invading
my privacy, Todd.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.821
You don't know me.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.590
Hard truth is Travis was fired
for pissin in the sweet tea tank

03:43.590 --> 03:46.726
for the third time this month,
so I'm picking up his shift.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.829
- All right, then. What
time can I expect you home?

03:49.829 --> 03:51.898
Would you like us to save you
some dinner?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.200
- Oh, nah. Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.069
I might be out pretty late,
actually.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.871
- (belches) Wow. Big plans
after work.

03:58.871 --> 04:01.808
Plans so big that we
shouldn't save you dinner.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.377
- Yeah, actually, Todd, (laughs)
me and some of my friends

04:04.377 --> 04:06.913
might just go out and tear
around town, you know,

04:06.913 --> 04:10.016
flipping stuff up and
ripping stuff down. (laughs)

04:10.016 --> 04:11.818
- Oh, fun.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.753
- (scoffs) Yeah. That'll be
the day.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.988
- What's that?

04:14.988 --> 04:17.023
- Hey, if you got so many
friends,

04:17.023 --> 04:19.859
how about I, uh, save a spot
for 'em at the table, right?

04:19.859 --> 04:22.695
That way they can all join us
for dinner, all your friends!

04:22.695 --> 04:24.697
- Why do you wear a full suit
and tie every goddamn day,

04:24.697 --> 04:26.199
Todd, you sell
wholesale buckets

04:26.199 --> 04:28.534
of doomsday mac and cheese
over the phone.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.938
- Because the clothes
define the man, Marcus.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.873
Clearly a lesson you could
stand to learn.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.175
- I told you not to
call me Marcus anymore.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.444
My name is Onyx the
Fortuitous, and I'm proud

04:38.444 --> 04:40.580
of what we accomplish at
the Meat Hut every day.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.982
- Boys! Boys! (sighs)

04:42.982 --> 04:45.151
You two have been family
for over a year now,

04:45.151 --> 04:49.622
and I will not tolerate these
yelling matches anymore.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.958
Marcus, I could understand if
your father

04:51.958 --> 04:54.427
was still in the house, but
this is Todd,

04:54.427 --> 04:57.063
your stepfather, and my lover.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.598
- Ugh.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.801
- Now, I want you two to
breathe with me, okay?

05:01.801 --> 05:06.272
Breathe in. (inhales)

05:06.272 --> 05:08.841
(Nancy exhales)
- Fuck you, Todd.

05:08.841 --> 05:09.776
- Good. In.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.280
And out.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.983
- Fuck you, Onyx the
Fart-uitous.

05:19.585 --> 05:21.954
- Fuck you, Todd!
- Fuck you, Marcus!

05:21.954 --> 05:23.289
- Boys!
(microwave dings)

05:23.289 --> 05:25.892
(bright music)

05:28.094 --> 05:30.530
(bell dings)
- Order up, number 46.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.865
Hold the slaw, extra slaw,
prairie pepper hot sauce

05:32.865 --> 05:35.101
on the side with a slap of
pickles.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.704
(upbeat music)

05:42.375 --> 05:43.843
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.179
Check the weight on that.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.316
You're one fry short.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.885
(bright music)

06:00.526 --> 06:03.696
(cash register dings)

06:04.864 --> 06:07.367
Cash run, Derrell.
Low on fives.

06:14.273 --> 06:17.643
(computer game beeping)

06:20.646 --> 06:22.081
Um, Masha?

06:22.081 --> 06:24.350
- What, Marcus? Fuck!

06:24.350 --> 06:26.686
- I was just wondering if you
got my new name tag in yet.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.187
- Your what?

06:28.187 --> 06:30.456
- Remember a few weeks ago
I requested a new name tag,

06:30.456 --> 06:32.592
one that read Onyx the
Fortuitous?

06:32.592 --> 06:34.927
I even applied for one through
corporate and everything.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.363
- That's not your name.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.800
- Oh, yeah, uh, um, well,
this one's not my name either,

06:40.800 --> 06:43.669
because my name is Marcus
Trillbury, yeah,

06:43.669 --> 06:46.606
but this says
Marquay Dickberry.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.107
And it's been like that since
day one.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.375
I've been here six years.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.310
- Look, if you want a
different name tag,

06:51.310 --> 06:53.246
check the junk box.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.384
(computer game beeping)

06:58.384 --> 07:00.319
- You lose.
- Oh, fuck!

07:00.319 --> 07:03.189
Fuck, fuck, fuck me in my
dirty cunt!

07:03.189 --> 07:06.459
(drawer bangs)

07:06.459 --> 07:07.827
- Oh, God!

07:07.827 --> 07:09.362
- What's up, Pussyhound?

07:11.964 --> 07:14.000
- What's up, Tanner,
Tanner's bois?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.004
(Tanner's bois barking)

07:18.004 --> 07:20.106
How can I make your day a
bit beefier?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.641
- (sucks teeth) Yeah, we're
gonna need 12

07:21.641 --> 07:24.277
Beefy Bad Boy meals,
Monster Style curly fries,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.446
I'm gonna need some sodas for
my hounds.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.215
And you know-
(Boi whispers indistinctly)

07:29.215 --> 07:32.685
Yeah, and a Sweet N' Sugary
Strawberry Shimmy Shake,

07:32.685 --> 07:36.522
and Vanilla Bean Cream Supreme,
mixed.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.892
- Is that all?
- No.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.863
I want a Peter Plumpkin
Toaster Pie, but slightly cool.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.766
I don't want it to be too
hot for my baby mouth.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.804
Hey, it's free in five on
Fridays, right?

07:52.672 --> 07:53.506
- Yes, sir.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.877
- Well then you better
hop to it.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.814
(Tanner's bois laugh)

08:01.814 --> 08:04.417
(upbeat music)

08:09.956 --> 08:13.392
(upbeat music continues)

08:16.562 --> 08:18.664
- There you are, Tanner.
Tanner's bois.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.600
(Tanner's bois bark)

08:20.600 --> 08:22.034
We're just waiting on
the burgers.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.002
- Time's almost up.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.371
(Tanner's bois bark)

08:25.371 --> 08:27.573
- Hurry, hurry, patty slinger.
- You smell like beef!

08:27.573 --> 08:28.975
(person laughs)
Gross.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.344
- [Tanner] Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.648
- When in doubt, skewer it out.

08:35.648 --> 08:38.251
(upbeat music)

08:40.419 --> 08:44.423
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

08:45.258 --> 08:48.895
six, five, four,

08:48.895 --> 08:51.964
three, two, one.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.969
Uh-uh, times up.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.271
- But I-
- Lean in.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.673
Lean in. Come on.

09:08.314 --> 09:13.319
(shake sloshing)
(Tanner's bois laughing)

09:14.053 --> 09:16.355
(Tanner's bois barking)

09:16.355 --> 09:19.058
(Tanner laughs)

09:21.394 --> 09:25.131
(Tanner's bois barking)

09:25.131 --> 09:26.299
Patty slinger.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.104
- Tell Masha I quit!
- What?

09:32.104 --> 09:33.606
- Tell Masha I quit!

09:36.576 --> 09:38.711
(knocking)
- Yes?

09:38.711 --> 09:41.347
- Um, Pussyhound quit.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.523
- Dear God.

09:51.824 --> 09:52.658
Or the devil.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.497
Whichever one's listening,
I guess. (sobs)

09:58.497 --> 10:00.700
Um, I was wondering

10:01.867 --> 10:03.970
if maybe he could give
me a different life.

10:05.605 --> 10:09.742
Yeah, different than the one
I have right now currently.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.246
(gentle music)

10:16.015 --> 10:18.384
Yeah, I'd really like a
different life, please.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.822
'Cause this one's not working
out so well.

10:24.657 --> 10:29.662
(Onyx sobs)
(computer chimes)

10:37.737 --> 10:39.305
(horn blows)
- Congratulations.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.873
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:40.873 --> 10:42.575
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.343
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.078
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.446
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.015
(Onyx wheezes)
Congratulations.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.750
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.518
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

10:52.518 --> 10:56.155
(Onyx barking and laughing)

10:57.690 --> 10:59.291
- I've been invited to
Bartok's mansion

10:59.291 --> 11:01.961
to take part in a
once-in-a-lifetime ritual

11:01.961 --> 11:04.196
in which he, along with five
of his most loyal followers,

11:04.196 --> 11:05.398
will attempt to raise
the spirit

11:05.398 --> 11:06.899
of the ancient demon, Abaddon.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.770
- That's nice, dear, but
you're not going anywhere

11:10.770 --> 11:12.405
until you scoop that
litter box.

11:15.574 --> 11:18.377
(litter rustling)

11:20.346 --> 11:23.082
(cat purrs)

11:23.082 --> 11:24.950
(cat meows)

11:24.950 --> 11:27.687
(majestic music)

11:37.296 --> 11:40.866
(majestic music continues)

11:44.637 --> 11:47.440
(Mr. Duke chuckling)

11:47.440 --> 11:50.142
(majestic music)

11:53.746 --> 11:54.947
- [Onyx] Oh!

11:54.947 --> 11:57.650
(majestic music)

12:03.155 --> 12:08.127
- Ah, Briardale Manor,
Bartok's estate. Astounding.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.996
Truly a sight to behold.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.631
- It's the kind of house
that makes you wanna recreate

12:12.631 --> 12:14.800
the 1993 Michael Bay directed
music video

12:14.800 --> 12:17.336
for Meat Loaf's "I'd
Do Anything for Love."

12:18.304 --> 12:21.107
I dunno. But I won't do that.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.311
(Mack giggles)
- How do we get in?

12:25.311 --> 12:29.415
- Oh! Let's explore.
(giggles)

12:29.415 --> 12:32.051
- This is wonderful.
(Shelley laughing)

12:32.051 --> 12:35.721
Carpe diem. (laughs)

12:35.721 --> 12:39.525
- I'm Mackenzie. You can
call me Mack, or Zee.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.728
- Oh, cool, my name is Marcus,
but, uh-

12:44.530 --> 12:45.364
- But...

12:46.799 --> 12:50.469
- I'd really love it if you
called me Onyx the Fortuitous.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.540
- Sounds good. Nice to meet
you, Onyx.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.777
- Nice to meet you, Zee.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.747
(cheery music)

13:05.117 --> 13:07.787
- Ooh, wowy, wowy,
wowy, wowy!

13:07.787 --> 13:10.389
(cheery music)

13:13.559 --> 13:16.662
(gasps) Oh. Ah.

13:16.662 --> 13:20.032
♪ Emerald is my favorite ♪

13:20.032 --> 13:20.866
- Peridot.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.969
- Pardon me?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.471
- Oh, it's peridot.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.974
Emerald tends to have a
deeper, more verdant hue,

13:28.974 --> 13:33.979
whereas peridot is lighter
and more olive-colored.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.950
- I love that you know that.
Power in knowledge, eh?

13:37.950 --> 13:40.119
- Yeah.
(both laugh)

13:40.119 --> 13:41.654
- There's a note.
- (gasps) Ooh!

13:42.755 --> 13:44.990
(Shelley laughs and
clears throat)

13:44.990 --> 13:47.493
"A warm welcome to the
most devoted

13:47.493 --> 13:49.795
and devout of Bartok's
betrothed.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.434
These necklaces are to cleanse
you of any unwelcome spirits

13:55.434 --> 13:59.071
before you enter this
sacred and unholy space.

13:59.071 --> 14:02.641
Please place a personal item
in the box.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.177
Leaving this item will help
ground you to the house

14:05.177 --> 14:08.681
and act as an offering of
familiarity.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.383
Once you have left your
item, please, each of you

14:11.383 --> 14:15.287
place a crystal around your
neck and step into the foyer."

14:18.257 --> 14:20.559
(Onyx breathing heavily)

14:20.559 --> 14:22.294
(whimsical music)

14:22.294 --> 14:27.299
- Mm-mm.
(whimsical music)

14:28.934 --> 14:33.939
Mm-mm.
(whimsical music)

14:41.747 --> 14:42.548
Ah.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.485
- Is that the only luggage
you brought?

14:46.485 --> 14:47.887
- It's got everything I need.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.723
(whimsical music)

14:52.725 --> 14:55.494
(ethereal music)

15:04.770 --> 15:08.374
(ethereal music continues)

15:12.278 --> 15:14.280
(all laughing)

15:14.280 --> 15:15.514
Did y'all see that?
- Yes.

15:15.514 --> 15:17.049
- Did everyone see that
little shimmer thing?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.884
(laughs) That's tight.

15:18.884 --> 15:22.254
(laughs) That's tight.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.723
(chiming music)
(Onyx gasps)

15:24.723 --> 15:27.326
(door squeaks)

15:30.362 --> 15:33.565
- Come on.
(person giggles)

15:33.565 --> 15:37.336
- What? No way.
- Oh, dear God.

15:37.336 --> 15:40.039
(dramatic music)

15:41.006 --> 15:43.008
(body thuds)

15:43.008 --> 15:43.943
- Oh, fuck!

15:45.144 --> 15:47.947
(TV crackles)

15:47.947 --> 15:51.116
- I hate to disappoint
you all,

15:51.116 --> 15:56.121
my oh so loyal followers,
but I am dead.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.557
Dead as a doornail.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.462
This is not a trick or
an illusion.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.333
Go ahead, check my pulse.
I'll wait.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.835
(eerie music)

16:18.844 --> 16:23.849
What this is, is your
first test,

16:25.317 --> 16:29.488
a test of faith, one that
can bring me back to life.

16:31.590 --> 16:36.428
So if you have faith in me
now, show it.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.632
Speak it with me now with
hearts full of faith!

16:42.167 --> 16:44.737
Let him rise!

16:44.737 --> 16:45.838
Let him rise!

16:48.007 --> 16:51.643
- [All] Let him rise!
Let him rise!

16:51.643 --> 16:53.879
Let him rise! Let him rise!

16:55.180 --> 16:57.416
Let him rise! Let him rise!

16:59.485 --> 17:01.653
Let him rise! Let him rise!

17:04.056 --> 17:07.793
(fire crackles)
(Bartok gasps)

17:07.793 --> 17:09.228
- [Onyx] Huh? Oh!

17:10.362 --> 17:13.098
(dramatic music)

17:22.975 --> 17:27.980
(blood squelching)
(all gasp)

17:30.749 --> 17:33.519
(knife clatters)

17:34.853 --> 17:37.022
- What do I see before me?

17:41.126 --> 17:45.764
Children, ancient beings,
ideas.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.069
Atoms.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.407
But what are you really?

17:56.809 --> 18:01.346
Do you even know what
you are?

18:03.682 --> 18:04.850
Have no fear.

18:06.251 --> 18:11.123
This weekend you will take
part in three rituals,

18:12.524 --> 18:17.329
the first two in preparation
for the third and final,

18:18.197 --> 18:21.667
the ritual of Abaddon Rising.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.170
And in that ritual under
a blood moon,

18:25.170 --> 18:29.108
all of you shall be renewed

18:29.108 --> 18:31.777
as disciples in his name,

18:31.777 --> 18:36.782
disciples of Abaddon with
renewed purpose,

18:38.250 --> 18:42.287
knowledge, power, and yes,
my children, immortality!

18:44.556 --> 18:45.390
- Nice.
- Schwa?

18:46.358 --> 18:48.927
(all laughing)

18:50.095 --> 18:54.800
- Tonight, drink and eat

18:54.800 --> 18:56.969
in communion with one another.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.205
Make merry and rest.

19:01.373 --> 19:06.078
For tomorrow, you will
take the first steps

19:06.078 --> 19:07.112
towards your rebirth.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.918
(all laughing)

19:14.520 --> 19:15.787
- [Onyx] Thank you, Bartok!

19:15.787 --> 19:19.091
(all clapping)
- Outstanding.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.693
(all laughing)

19:30.702 --> 19:34.306
(glass clinking)

19:34.306 --> 19:37.109
May I, uh, break the
proverbial ice, as it were,

19:37.109 --> 19:39.878
and ask what led each of
you to Lucifer

19:39.878 --> 19:41.613
and the teachings of Bartok?

19:41.613 --> 19:42.881
- Fuck, is that absinthe?

19:44.716 --> 19:46.752
- Well, why don't you start,
Mr. Duke?

19:46.752 --> 19:48.120
Break that proverbial ice.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.821
- Oh, well, I'd be delighted.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.857
My name is John Duke.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.560
I'm a teacher, so I'm used
to being called Mr. Duke,

19:54.560 --> 19:57.429
and that is just fine by me.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.965
I'm a man of literature and
languages.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.202
I've studied many religions
and theologies over the years.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.870
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.905
- In the Christian Bible,

20:06.905 --> 20:10.576
man is punished for seeking
knowledge.

20:10.576 --> 20:14.279
In the garden of Eden, the
closer you get to the devil,

20:14.279 --> 20:17.349
the closer you get to
the truth.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.419
And I believe that Bartok
hears the truth

20:20.419 --> 20:23.055
directly from Lucifer.

20:23.055 --> 20:27.993
And truth, ah, truth is
what I seek above all.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.862
- I'll go next. (giggles)

20:30.862 --> 20:32.331
Mine is quick.

20:32.331 --> 20:36.702
Um, I actually have a poem
memorized that tells my story.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.437
- Oh, cool.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.276
(Shelley clears throat)

20:46.712 --> 20:49.715
There was a young woman
who worshiped the Lord.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.751
In church every Sunday,
her God she adored.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.587
She would help run the
service collect all the tithes,

20:55.587 --> 20:58.857
her husband and children
always by her side.

20:58.857 --> 21:02.127
She was taught that a
Christian's work isn't in vain.

21:02.127 --> 21:05.864
She hoped serving Jesus
might shield her from pain.

21:05.864 --> 21:10.002
Then one day she got word
that her husband had perished,

21:10.002 --> 21:12.638
taken by a drunk driver
in a flash.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.674
All she cherished was
broken and twisted up

21:15.674 --> 21:17.609
in shards of metal.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.145
That young woman in her grief

21:20.145 --> 21:25.150
took solace in the devil.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.253
(somber music)

21:30.422 --> 21:31.256
Thank you.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.194
- Your husband died, so you
started worshiping the devil?

21:37.596 --> 21:40.232
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I get it.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.600
It's like that one time
in middle school,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.435
I asked out my crush,
Rebekah Love Rodriguez,

21:43.435 --> 21:44.970
and she told me to
go suck an egg.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.405
So I just listened to the
"Phantom of the Opera"

21:46.405 --> 21:48.040
soundtrack for weeks.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.208
- Oh.

21:50.208 --> 21:53.879
- Well, what brought you
to Bartok, Marcus, hmm?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.815
What started you down this
lighted path that led you here?

21:58.817 --> 22:01.320
- Mine's a pretty darkened
tale as well. I dunno.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.821
So I might need a little
something, something

22:02.821 --> 22:04.756
to loosen up the tongue to
spin this tortured yarn.

22:04.756 --> 22:06.625
- You want some of that?
- Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.026
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.363
Dangerous personality
types run in my family,

22:11.363 --> 22:13.065
so I've gotta be very
intentional when it comes

22:13.065 --> 22:15.600
to my libatious intake,
I dunno.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.235
I stick to my tiny wines.

22:22.240 --> 22:27.245
Mama always said, "Too mooch
juice and the beast gets loose."

22:28.647 --> 22:30.048
(laughs) But I just need
enough to get my courage up.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.984
(objects rustling)

22:40.125 --> 22:43.795
(objects continue rustling)

22:44.996 --> 22:47.599
(gentle music)

22:57.142 --> 23:00.345
(Onyx exhales shakily)

23:01.646 --> 23:03.148
I was eight years old when
my father left.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.916
That weekend, my mama
took me to the flea market

23:04.916 --> 23:07.986
and gave me five bucks to
spend on anything I wanted.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.655
I dunno, to help
keep my mind off things.

23:10.655 --> 23:13.692
At first, I saw a Cabbage
Patch Doll with my name on it.

23:13.692 --> 23:16.762
Hooey, that doll was
something fierce.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.463
Spotted freckles. (laughs)

23:18.463 --> 23:21.199
A little twist of red
yarn hair.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.802
Goddamn, it was a sight
to behold.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.172
And I always did think I'd
be a daddy to a ginger.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.006
- Oh.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.742
- But just before I handed
that fine doll seller

23:30.742 --> 23:33.111
my crispy Lincoln, I saw it,
one rack over

23:33.111 --> 23:35.414
behind a Lou Ferrigno
Christmas album,

23:35.414 --> 23:37.716
Bartok's first record.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.887
- Ah, "The Devil's Due."
- "The Devil's Due."

23:41.887 --> 23:45.891
I don't know what made me buy
it. Curiosity, compulsion?

23:45.891 --> 23:46.725
- Fate.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.593
- Mayhaps. Mayhaps.

23:50.328 --> 23:51.830
It also might have been
the goatee.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.065
Ever since ALF, I've had
an obsession with hair,

23:54.065 --> 23:58.370
both body and facial, wanting
more of it, wanting less.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.072
Having too mooch,
but never enoof.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.641
ALF's real name is
Gordon Shumway.

24:02.641 --> 24:05.076
- Can you finish your
story? Bartok, the record.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.611
- Oh, yeah, so I bought
the record, took it home,

24:06.611 --> 24:08.947
listened to it a bunch,
been a big fan ever since.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.050
- Oh, beautiful. (laughs)

24:12.918 --> 24:14.953
What about you, Jesminder?

24:14.953 --> 24:16.721
Oh, come on.

24:16.721 --> 24:20.392
The harder the shell,
the deeper the crack.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.393
Oh. Oh.

24:22.828 --> 24:27.165
- I am Jesminder. You can
call me Jesminder, not Jess.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.035
I am a tattoo artist
from Vegas,

24:30.035 --> 24:32.737
and do not ask me how many
tattoos I have.

24:32.737 --> 24:34.973
The question is rote
and basic.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.508
- Yeah.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.611
- My reason for being here
is different.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.182
I was Bartok's wife in a
past life,

24:45.650 --> 24:48.453
many past lives actually, and
I'm here to be with him again.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.624
We have already died a
thousand deaths together,

24:52.624 --> 24:56.261
and I would die a thousand
more just to be here now.

24:57.529 --> 25:00.532
I'm here for him, and not
to make merry,

25:00.532 --> 25:02.334
and not to mince words.

25:04.135 --> 25:06.905
- Oh, yeah, no, I don't
think you are mincing words.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.306
I dunno.

25:08.306 --> 25:09.708
- Why do you, why do you
keep saying that?

25:09.708 --> 25:10.542
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know.

25:13.712 --> 25:14.980
- I dunno.

25:14.980 --> 25:19.951
- (laughs) Well, I'm Mack,
they/them.

25:21.152 --> 25:24.289
And feel free to ask me
how many tattoos I have.

25:24.289 --> 25:26.791
The answer's 12. My
favorite's Snoopy on my ankle.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.394
- Oh, I love Snoopy.
- Oh, me too.

25:29.394 --> 25:34.065
- And much like Mr. Duke, I'm
an investigator, a seeker.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.301
I believe in the power of
the elements,

25:36.301 --> 25:38.637
the natural elements.

25:38.637 --> 25:43.408
Bartok, I came across in high
school, consumed all his work.

25:43.408 --> 25:46.578
Through him, I've come to
learn more about myself

25:46.578 --> 25:49.548
and my place in the
world around me.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.050
(lips pop)

25:52.050 --> 25:55.220
- (chuckles) Wow. Will
you look at us, huh?

25:55.220 --> 25:58.156
Five individuals from
differing backgrounds

25:58.156 --> 26:02.561
in various walks of life,
all assembled here, now,

26:02.561 --> 26:05.630
to take part in
something extraordinary

26:05.630 --> 26:08.900
and unprecedented
in his unholy name.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.969
(chuckles) Cheers to that.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.737
- To immortality!

26:12.737 --> 26:14.973
- [All] To immortality!

26:14.973 --> 26:18.243
- [Onyx] To immortality!
(all laugh)

26:18.243 --> 26:22.080
(voices echoing indistinctly)

26:23.949 --> 26:26.251
I'm so happy to be here
in Bartok's mansion.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.923
- [Mr. Duke] So, Onyx, Onyx,
tell me more about this ALF.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.727
- [Onyx] Yeah, so ALF's
real name is Gordon Shumway.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.495
- Where is he from?
- Yeah, well, he's from

26:37.495 --> 26:40.632
the planet Melmac,
but he crash lands-

26:40.632 --> 26:44.302
- [Attendee] And then
I chopped my hair off.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.172
- Well, what do you see?

26:48.940 --> 26:53.945
(eerie music)
(all laughing)

26:55.847 --> 26:58.617
- The chubby one didn't drink.
- What?

26:59.784 --> 27:03.755
The patty slinger?
Can't you make him?

27:03.755 --> 27:06.224
- It doesn't really work that
way. They have to be willing.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.328
- Well, what of everyone else?

27:10.328 --> 27:12.464
- Everything seems to
be going as planned.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.165
- Seems?

27:15.500 --> 27:16.935
You don't sound so sure.

27:17.936 --> 27:18.770
- I-

27:18.770 --> 27:20.939
(all laughing)

27:20.939 --> 27:23.041
- Do we have anything to
worry about?

27:23.041 --> 27:24.776
Is the ritual going to work?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.413
(dramatic music)

27:29.681 --> 27:31.249
- No.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.251
- No, the ritual won't work?

27:33.251 --> 27:35.086
- No, we have nothing to
worry about.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.925
- Good. Then we move forward.

27:42.193 --> 27:45.296
Tomorrow you will guide them

27:45.296 --> 27:50.268
through the first ritual,
"The Book of Blood."

27:51.336 --> 27:54.406
This will quell any
uncertainty

27:54.406 --> 27:58.877
and lead us one step
closer to the talisman.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.579
(ethereal music)

28:03.148 --> 28:06.084
(birds chirping)

28:06.084 --> 28:07.485
(microphone squealing)

28:07.485 --> 28:11.056
Good morning, Marcus, Jesminder,
John, Shelley, and Mack.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.758
This is a reminder to please
wear your cleansing stones

28:13.758 --> 28:16.795
at all times during your
stay at Briardale Manor.

28:16.795 --> 28:19.364
After your meal, we will
meet in the ritual room

28:19.364 --> 28:22.701
with full bellies, steady
hearts, and willing spirits.

28:23.568 --> 28:27.405
(microphone squeals)

28:27.405 --> 28:30.175
(dramatic music)

28:31.476 --> 28:34.312
(Shelley giggles)

28:37.716 --> 28:40.218
(door clangs)

28:45.390 --> 28:46.658
Good morning, all.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.027
I am Farrah,
delegate to Bartok,

28:49.027 --> 28:50.762
servant to our great
Lord Lucifer.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.432
This is the Grand Grimoire.

28:54.432 --> 28:56.134
(all gasp)

28:56.134 --> 28:56.968
- Oh.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.137
What's that?

28:59.137 --> 29:01.005
- It's like the devil's bible.

29:01.005 --> 29:04.209
- All the unholy knowledge
in the world

29:04.209 --> 29:08.046
bound in the skin of
fallen angels.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.482
- Sick.

29:10.482 --> 29:13.051
- You were not chosen
at random.

29:13.051 --> 29:16.721
The souls required to perform
the ritual of Abaddon Rising

29:16.721 --> 29:19.724
were called out a
millennia ago by this book.

29:21.192 --> 29:24.195
You will each need to bleed
on the primary sigil, here.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.663
The book will tell me
whether or not

29:25.663 --> 29:27.265
you have a rightful place.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.670
Who would like to
approach first?

29:33.838 --> 29:34.806
- Let's do this.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.377
I know my place.

29:39.377 --> 29:40.979
- Your hand.

29:40.979 --> 29:45.283
(dramatic music)
Et In Nomine Tuo.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.052
(dramatic music)

29:55.160 --> 29:56.161
Next.

29:56.161 --> 29:59.564
(attendee gasps)
(dramatic music)

29:59.564 --> 30:02.700
(Marcus whimpers)

30:02.700 --> 30:05.136
- Mm, ow! Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.206
Ow, fuck. Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, mm.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.374
- The book, Marcus.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.211
- Mm. How many squeezes?

30:13.211 --> 30:14.712
How many squeezes?
- That, that's enough.

30:14.712 --> 30:15.547
That's enough.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.319
(Farrah whispers indistinctly)

30:21.319 --> 30:24.088
(dramatic music)

30:33.331 --> 30:34.933
Yes.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.668
- What does it mean?

30:36.668 --> 30:39.804
- You have royal blood
dating back generations.

30:39.804 --> 30:43.174
You are the queen.
And you are allowed.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.142
- I knew it.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.715
(Shelley gasps)

30:50.715 --> 30:51.950
- The viking.

30:51.950 --> 30:52.917
- Wow. What?

30:55.353 --> 30:57.555
- You exist within an
ancient Nordic bloodline

30:57.555 --> 31:00.925
that flows forward and
backward from your family.

31:00.925 --> 31:02.560
You are allowed.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.431
- Ooh, holy crap!
Can you believe it?

31:06.431 --> 31:10.068
I'm a Viking, y'all. (growls)

31:10.068 --> 31:15.073
(laughs) Up top, up top!
(laughs)

31:23.581 --> 31:27.051
- Leave it to our dark
father to surprise us.

31:27.051 --> 31:32.056
Turns out this polished, refined
man built of tweed and twee

31:33.524 --> 31:35.360
is also a werewolf.

31:36.494 --> 31:38.463
Lycanthrope blood pulses
through your veins.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.733
Whatever the amount and
however dormant it may be,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.534
it is still present nonetheless.

31:44.702 --> 31:46.437
And you are allowed.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.844
(dramatic music)

31:53.878 --> 31:56.114
A mystic. Spellcaster.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.351
The witch in this
lifetime and many others.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.488
- Really?
- You have great power,

32:03.488 --> 32:04.756
but you already knew that.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.724
Use it wisely.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.561
You, Mackenzie, are allowed.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.171
- Huh?

32:20.171 --> 32:23.708
- You are the virgin.
And you are allowed.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.476
- What the fuck?

32:25.476 --> 32:26.611
- You're just as an
important piece

32:26.611 --> 32:28.613
to this puzzle as anyone else.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.282
- Bullshit. Jesminder's
an ancient queen.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.051
Shelley found out
she's a viking.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.986
Oh, how cool and against
type is that?

32:34.986 --> 32:39.257
Mr. Duke is part fucking
werewolf. Are you kidding me?

32:39.257 --> 32:41.059
And Mack's an
all-too-powerful witch,

32:41.059 --> 32:43.628
but I'm just a fat fucking,
fat fucking virgin.

32:44.829 --> 32:49.100
Oh, goddamn, they did your
boy dirty.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.970
- Well, are you a virgin?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.604
- Huh?

32:53.604 --> 32:56.641
- Are you a virgin, Marcus?

32:56.641 --> 32:58.109
There's no shame in it.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.210
- Well, first of all,
Mr. Duke,

32:59.210 --> 33:00.678
there is shame in everything.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.447
I'm surprised they didn't
teach you that in Yale school.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.849
And besides that, yes,
I am a virgin, goddamn.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.351
The only thing that's
ever touched my wee-wee

33:06.351 --> 33:08.619
is my never washed pair of
Battle K.A.T.T.S. Underoos.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.989
(book slams)

33:10.989 --> 33:13.157
- The point is, all is
in place

33:13.157 --> 33:15.426
for the ritual of
Abaddon Rising,

33:15.426 --> 33:18.296
a ritual that requires one
lycan, one witch, one viking,

33:18.296 --> 33:21.366
one queen, and yes,
one virgin.

33:21.366 --> 33:23.434
- Goddammit.

33:23.434 --> 33:26.237
- I must report my findings.
You will hear from me soon.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.543
- So you've never even...

33:34.879 --> 33:39.884
- What? No. (laughs)

33:41.953 --> 33:43.521
I mean, what would that
even do?

33:46.057 --> 33:48.593
(Onyx laughs)

33:52.964 --> 33:56.100
- Each are devoted,
each bled for you.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.168
All five are present.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.773
- They're all here. All five.

34:02.740 --> 34:03.574
- All of them.

34:05.009 --> 34:07.178
We're so close. So close.

34:09.647 --> 34:10.915
- Open it.

34:10.915 --> 34:13.684
(dramatic music)

34:18.489 --> 34:19.991
Okay.

34:22.827 --> 34:26.030
Show me the way, Lord.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.633
Show me the way to
the talisman.

34:30.635 --> 34:33.905
Show me the way to true power.

34:33.905 --> 34:38.276
Pay me back for all the years
of service. Show me the way!

34:40.311 --> 34:42.313
Show me the fucking way.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.419
Ooh.

34:50.054 --> 34:50.888
Ooh.

34:52.457 --> 34:56.094
Yes.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.229
Thank you, Father. (laughs)

35:04.335 --> 35:07.105
(dramatic music)

35:12.777 --> 35:13.611
Boom.

35:15.379 --> 35:19.117
Tonight, we capture

35:21.953 --> 35:22.787
eternity.

35:23.688 --> 35:26.424
(dramatic music)

35:27.592 --> 35:30.695
(crickets chirping)
(Shelley laughing)

35:30.695 --> 35:33.698
(Mr. Duke laughing)

35:36.834 --> 35:40.371
- So have you ever
like, transformed?

35:42.673 --> 35:44.308
- Never.

35:44.308 --> 35:48.646
I've never even imagined being
anything more than a man.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.116
Never even dreamt
it a possibility.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.652
That is until...

35:57.355 --> 35:59.524
- Until when?

35:59.524 --> 36:01.025
- I have kissed
somebody before,

36:01.025 --> 36:02.927
so I've lost my
mouth virginity.

36:02.927 --> 36:05.696
But I guess that's just not
enough for that stupid book.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.599
- I had a dream last night.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.236
And I believe it
was preparing me

36:12.236 --> 36:14.505
for what the Book of Blood
would reveal.

36:15.907 --> 36:20.912
In it, I, I saw my hands
growing claws,

36:23.948 --> 36:26.984
and my face, my face
covered in fur.

36:28.686 --> 36:32.089
I was inside of my own body,

36:32.089 --> 36:34.325
but somehow outside of
it as well.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.159
- Me too.

36:36.394 --> 36:37.995
I had a dream just like it.

36:37.995 --> 36:40.431
I mean, not the werewolf part.

36:40.431 --> 36:44.302
But it was a foreshadowing
of sorts.

36:45.469 --> 36:50.208
I was on the ocean in
a great, great big boat

36:53.010 --> 36:55.046
surrounded by men,

36:56.380 --> 36:59.016
all looking to me for orders.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.119
- Sounds legit.

37:03.521 --> 37:04.822
- My friend Elijah thought
I got a hand job once

37:04.822 --> 37:06.424
from Kim Greene when we all
skipped school

37:06.424 --> 37:08.459
to go see a matinee of
"Ever After."

37:08.459 --> 37:10.061
I don't know, but in reality,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.096
Kim had just dropped a
piece of popcorn on my lap

37:12.096 --> 37:15.733
and had a wicked hard time
retrieving that rogue kernel.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.101
- I dreamt I was on a throne

37:18.502 --> 37:20.438
with an ever-expanding
army at my beck and call.

37:21.305 --> 37:25.676
A queen surveying many lands.

37:30.047 --> 37:33.050
- Oh, cool, well, I dreamt I
didn't fuck anybody last night,

37:33.050 --> 37:36.087
so I guess we all had
pretty fortuitous dreams.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.023
(lighter clicking)

37:43.194 --> 37:45.863
(door clicking)

37:47.632 --> 37:50.301
(ominous music)

37:53.638 --> 37:55.706
- [Bartok] This way.
Stay close.

37:55.706 --> 37:56.841
- [Farrah] Yes, master.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.882
- Mack, did you have a
dream last night?

38:04.882 --> 38:05.716
- Who's asking?

38:07.151 --> 38:08.519
- Well, Mr. Duke's asking.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.088
- Yeah. I, I, did.

38:12.556 --> 38:13.824
- You mind sharing?

38:15.526 --> 38:18.496
(Mack sighs)

38:18.496 --> 38:19.563
- I was a witch

38:21.232 --> 38:24.802
levitating above a
circle of other witches,

38:26.170 --> 38:28.973
all chanting my name
and lifting me up.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.978
- That's fucking tight too.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.180
Meanwhile, I slept like a
dumb-dumb baby.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.848
If I had a nightmare,
y'all'd know.

38:37.848 --> 38:40.084
I'd wake up gripping the
sheets something fierce

38:40.084 --> 38:41.252
and yelling, "Jesus!"

38:42.219 --> 38:43.087
- Interesting.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.958
We all, well, most of us,
had vivid dreams last night

38:47.958 --> 38:50.394
foretelling our callings
from the Book of Blood.

38:51.595 --> 38:53.731
But (sighs) what,
what does it mean?

38:54.865 --> 38:56.033
- How about this?

38:57.601 --> 39:02.173
We break into Bartok's study,
look at the Grimoire ourselves

39:02.173 --> 39:04.408
and find out what the
fuck it all means.

39:04.408 --> 39:05.843
- Schwa?

39:05.843 --> 39:08.579
- Well, Bartok and, uh, delegate
just left for the evening.

39:08.579 --> 39:11.115
I mean, I saw them go that way.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.950
Oh, come on, Mr. Duke.

39:14.318 --> 39:16.220
Think about all that juicy
knowledge

39:16.220 --> 39:18.055
that resides in that book.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.890
Don't you wanna sink
your little

39:19.890 --> 39:21.726
truth-seeking fangs into it?

39:21.726 --> 39:25.696
- I would die to know
more about that ritual.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.997
- Yes.

39:26.997 --> 39:29.533
- Tempted by the forbidden
fruit, huh?

39:32.002 --> 39:33.404
Dare we take a bite?

39:34.672 --> 39:35.506
- Dare we?

39:36.674 --> 39:39.810
(Mr. Duke and Onyx laugh)

39:39.810 --> 39:41.245
- Dare we?

39:41.245 --> 39:44.014
(dramatic music)

39:44.915 --> 39:47.218
(thunder crashes)

39:47.218 --> 39:49.987
(dramatic music)

39:55.292 --> 39:57.762
(thunder crashes)

39:57.762 --> 40:00.498
(dramatic music)

40:03.467 --> 40:05.069
(Mr. Duke grunts)

40:05.069 --> 40:06.537
Let me try.

40:06.537 --> 40:08.005
I've got a surprisingly
firm grip due to the amount

40:08.005 --> 40:10.341
of marshmallow fluff jars
I've opened up over the years.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.544
(laughs) I used to put
that shit on everything.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.381
(Onyx grunts)

40:19.917 --> 40:22.686
(dramatic music)

40:22.686 --> 40:24.688
- What? Are we close?

40:27.191 --> 40:28.092
- Yes, I think so.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.665
(Onyx grunts)

40:34.665 --> 40:37.401
- I'm talking English muffins.
I'm talking Pop-Tarts.

40:37.401 --> 40:41.038
Fuck, I'm even talking bean
burritos. I don't give a shit.

40:41.038 --> 40:42.239
(Onyx grunts)

40:42.239 --> 40:44.975
(dramatic music)

40:54.819 --> 40:55.619
- Here.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.390
The map says here.

40:59.390 --> 41:02.059
(dramatic music)

41:04.995 --> 41:07.031
(shrubbery rustling)

41:07.031 --> 41:10.201
(thunder crashes)

41:10.201 --> 41:12.837
(intense music)

41:18.676 --> 41:21.445
(dramatic music)

41:28.652 --> 41:29.854
(shovel clangs)
(Bartok grunts)

41:29.854 --> 41:32.523
(Onyx grunting)

41:34.492 --> 41:37.094
(Onyx panting)

41:38.896 --> 41:43.901
(thunder crashes)
(dramatic music)

41:45.603 --> 41:47.171
- Well, can anyone pick a lock?

41:47.171 --> 41:48.839
- Wait, my Meat Hut
skeleton key.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.741
- Your what?

41:50.741 --> 41:52.877
- This key opens everything.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.578
I inherited it from my former
boss, Rick,

41:54.578 --> 41:56.580
the night he quit the Meat
Hut, left me in charge,

41:56.580 --> 41:58.415
and promptly killed himself.

41:58.415 --> 42:00.818
I don't know, I think Rick's
wife might've left him,

42:00.818 --> 42:03.254
or maybe Rick never had a
wife at all.

42:03.254 --> 42:06.957
- Marcus, this lock is most
likely 200 years old or more.

42:06.957 --> 42:09.293
There is no way your
fast food key is gonna...

42:10.794 --> 42:12.596
Oh.
(Mack laughs)

42:12.596 --> 42:14.164
Oh, I stand corrected.

42:14.164 --> 42:16.934
(dramatic music)

42:21.805 --> 42:25.175
Unholy Father, how you
blessed us.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.879
- [Onyx] Oh.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.881
- There.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.984
- [Mack] The book.

42:33.984 --> 42:37.721
(Onyx imitates horn playing)

42:40.691 --> 42:42.526
(Onyx laughs)

42:42.526 --> 42:43.360
- Ah.

42:45.062 --> 42:48.732
- [Mr. Duke] Ah, here it is.
(laughs)

42:48.732 --> 42:50.868
- [Mack] Well, can you read it?

42:50.868 --> 42:52.803
- In, in, in pieces.

42:52.803 --> 42:54.638
It's written in an
ancient language

42:54.638 --> 42:58.943
I'm not entirely familiar
with, possibly Samarian or,

42:58.943 --> 43:00.811
or a derivative of such.

43:00.811 --> 43:04.515
I brought my compact mini
library of dead languages

43:04.515 --> 43:06.750
with me,
but they're in my room.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.018
- Nerd.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.520
- [Onyx] What does it
say about the virgin?

43:09.520 --> 43:10.754
That he has the power to
cradle his flacid wee-wee

43:10.754 --> 43:12.656
in his hands and cry
for hours on end?

43:13.724 --> 43:16.327
- Ah, here it is.

43:16.327 --> 43:21.332
"The ritual of Abaddon
Rising is meant to empower,

43:24.368 --> 43:29.373
imbue, something, something,
never-ending life."

43:32.409 --> 43:36.347
(shovel thuds)
(Bartok grunts)

43:36.347 --> 43:38.182
(shovel thumping)
- Oh, yes.

43:38.182 --> 43:42.987
- "But first, the Knife
of Dagon must be acquired,

43:42.987 --> 43:47.157
then the five devoted souls
must be..."

43:48.292 --> 43:49.793
- Must be what?

43:49.793 --> 43:52.262
- It, it, it's a word I'm
not entirely familiar with.

43:52.262 --> 43:56.100
Captivated? Enraptured?

43:56.100 --> 43:59.703
(thunder crashes)

43:59.703 --> 44:02.172
(Bartok gasps)

44:03.107 --> 44:05.609
(Bartok pants)

44:05.609 --> 44:10.080
"Once the five souls are
present, the map of Sammael

44:10.080 --> 44:15.085
will be revealed and lead
to the Talisman of Souls."

44:15.986 --> 44:19.657
(thunder crashes)

44:19.657 --> 44:20.591
- The what?

44:24.094 --> 44:27.031
(thunder crashing)

44:34.104 --> 44:37.441
(metal clanging)

44:37.441 --> 44:41.979
"Once the talisman is empowered
and in your possession,

44:41.979 --> 44:46.984
you will be able to summon
the infernal ruler Abaddon

44:48.719 --> 44:52.022
and absorb his power."

44:52.022 --> 44:53.657
(thunder crashes)

44:53.657 --> 44:56.493
(Bartok laughing)

45:07.104 --> 45:10.541
So if, if, if I'm to
understand this correctly,

45:10.541 --> 45:12.476
once Abaddon has risen-

45:12.476 --> 45:15.713
- (giggles) Aw.
- Our immortality is gained,

45:16.747 --> 45:20.451
Bartok takes Abaddon's power,
but-

45:20.451 --> 45:21.952
- But what?

45:21.952 --> 45:24.121
- There's a warning here at
the bottom.

45:24.121 --> 45:26.824
"If a mortal tries to
raise Abaddon,

45:27.725 --> 45:30.260
beware the prophecy of the-"

45:30.260 --> 45:32.996
(tooth creaking)

45:33.864 --> 45:36.567
(door creaking)

45:37.735 --> 45:40.571
- Secret passageways. Are you
kidding me?

45:45.909 --> 45:48.779
- The what? The prophecy of
the what?

45:48.779 --> 45:50.881
- The prophecy of the,
I don't know, it's gone.

45:50.881 --> 45:52.449
- What the fuck?

45:52.449 --> 45:54.585
(door creaking)

45:54.585 --> 45:56.120
- We have to go.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.755
Marcus.
- Onyx?

45:57.755 --> 45:59.590
- Zee?
- Onyx?

45:59.590 --> 46:01.191
- Zee!
- Onyx.

46:01.191 --> 46:02.659
- Zee!
- We have to go!

46:02.659 --> 46:03.794
- Zee!
- But Onyx-

46:03.794 --> 46:05.262
- Now, we have to go!

46:05.262 --> 46:06.764
- Onyx?
- Zee! Zee!

46:14.638 --> 46:17.307
(ominous music)

46:26.083 --> 46:29.520
(Onyx breathing heavily)

46:33.757 --> 46:36.426
(door scraping)

46:38.495 --> 46:40.931
(eerie music)

46:48.071 --> 46:51.408
(eerie music continues)

46:53.277 --> 46:55.612
(metal clanging)

46:55.612 --> 46:58.115
(eerie music)

47:04.054 --> 47:07.024
(talisman clanging)

47:13.664 --> 47:14.731
- Now, focus.

47:20.571 --> 47:21.572
Hail, Satan.

47:23.740 --> 47:25.275
- [Both] Son of light.

47:28.512 --> 47:30.514
- [Bartok] Bring me the
first sacrifice.

47:32.049 --> 47:34.751
(ominous music)

47:40.757 --> 47:44.261
(ominous music continues)

47:45.829 --> 47:50.467
(Bartok whispering in
foreign language)

47:55.706 --> 47:58.375
(loud knocking)

48:04.715 --> 48:07.651
(doors scraping)

48:07.651 --> 48:09.119
- I want to see Bartok.

48:11.288 --> 48:13.657
- Of course. He's been
expecting you.

48:13.657 --> 48:16.093
- Welcome, my dear.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.962
Please, have a seat.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.799
(doors slam)

48:28.739 --> 48:32.075
You know, you and I have
met many times

48:32.075 --> 48:35.045
over thousands and
thousands of years.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.384
And it has all culminated
into this moment.

48:40.384 --> 48:43.387
(suspenseful music)

48:48.025 --> 48:49.026
It's your time

48:51.028 --> 48:54.164
to make the ultimate sacrifice.

48:54.164 --> 48:57.167
(suspenseful music)

49:05.375 --> 49:08.111
(dramatic music)

49:16.653 --> 49:18.055
Ade due Damballa.

49:19.723 --> 49:22.359
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

49:24.628 --> 49:25.963
Secoise entienne

49:28.532 --> 49:29.366
mais pois

49:31.768 --> 49:32.936
de morte!
(blood squelches)

49:32.936 --> 49:37.774
(Onyx screams faintly)
(dramatic music)

49:37.774 --> 49:38.608
Yes.

49:39.743 --> 49:41.144
That's it.

49:41.144 --> 49:43.747
Give me all of you.
All of you.

49:45.182 --> 49:46.116
Everything.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.319
Every last drop.

49:53.957 --> 49:55.459
(talisman dings)

49:55.459 --> 49:58.095
(Jesminder gasps)

49:58.095 --> 50:00.931
(Onyx whimpers)
(Jesminder gasps)

50:00.931 --> 50:03.600
- (whimpering) Goddammit!

50:03.600 --> 50:05.402
So many fucking cobwebs.

50:06.269 --> 50:09.106
(Onyx whimpering)

50:10.674 --> 50:12.743
(Onyx screams)

50:12.743 --> 50:14.144
(Onyx thuds)

50:14.144 --> 50:14.978
- Onyx?

50:16.146 --> 50:17.914
- Oh, hey. (laughs)

50:17.914 --> 50:19.349
What are y'all doing in here?

50:19.349 --> 50:21.718
- Uh, Mr. Duke is just
trying to write down

50:21.718 --> 50:23.954
everything he can remember
from the book.

50:23.954 --> 50:25.989
We're trying to learn more
about the final ritual.

50:25.989 --> 50:28.458
- Oh, awesome. (chuckles)
Hell yeah.

50:29.626 --> 50:31.762
- Are you okay?

50:31.762 --> 50:34.831
- Ah, yeah, nah,
it's just, huh?

50:34.831 --> 50:37.667
What, how does that? Oh.
(laughs)

50:37.667 --> 50:39.202
There's a, I was wondering
how it,

50:39.202 --> 50:41.705
there's a little button
on the side so that, yeah,

50:41.705 --> 50:45.909
that just off and then back on
again, it's so cute. (laughs)

50:45.909 --> 50:49.846
Oh. I love the mechanics
of these vintage lamps.

50:49.846 --> 50:52.182
- Yeah, Onyx, you don't
really seem okay.

50:52.182 --> 50:54.117
Did something happen to you?

50:54.117 --> 50:56.520
- No. I just. (laughs)

50:58.388 --> 50:59.189
Huh.

51:02.659 --> 51:05.829
So when y'all left, I got
stuck behind this painting.

51:05.829 --> 51:08.131
- Aw, man, we're sorry. We
just didn't know where you were.

51:08.131 --> 51:10.267
- Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah.

51:10.267 --> 51:11.635
It's fine. It's fine.

51:12.736 --> 51:16.473
It's just, I saw
Jesminder and Bartok,

51:16.473 --> 51:18.809
and at first they were
just talking.

51:21.078 --> 51:24.481
But then they got a little
smoochie, which is fine.

51:24.481 --> 51:25.315
That's fine.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.385
But then-
- Then?

51:31.588 --> 51:34.057
- He stabbed her and stabbed
her until she was dead!

51:34.057 --> 51:35.492
- What?

51:35.492 --> 51:37.160
- With the Knife of
Dagon, right in the chest.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.429
And I watched all the
life drain from her eyes

51:39.429 --> 51:41.098
until she passed out
and turned into

51:41.098 --> 51:43.100
some kind of soulless ghoul.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.936
♪ Somewhere out there ♪

51:45.936 --> 51:47.737
- Wait, what the fuck
is happening?

51:47.737 --> 51:50.874
- Sorry. When I get nervous,
I start singing Fievel.

51:50.874 --> 51:52.142
Can I get one of those?

51:52.142 --> 51:52.943
- Yeah.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.746
(Onyx sighs)

51:56.746 --> 51:59.349
It doesn't sound like
immortality Mr. Duke.

52:00.283 --> 52:01.451
What the fuck is going on?

52:01.451 --> 52:03.086
Why did they really
bring us here?

52:04.521 --> 52:08.225
- Marcus, are you sure you
saw what you think you saw?

52:08.225 --> 52:09.693
- Oh, huh. Well, no.

52:09.693 --> 52:11.528
Let me think about it.
Maybe I, no, maybe I did.

52:11.528 --> 52:13.196
Yes. I fucking saw what
I think I saw.

52:13.196 --> 52:14.331
- Okay, okay.

52:14.331 --> 52:16.066
- The knife took out all
of her soul goo.

52:16.066 --> 52:19.569
And the handle glowed like
a bedazzled Lite-Brite.

52:19.569 --> 52:22.672
- Marcus, do you think you can
draw what that looked like?

52:22.672 --> 52:23.507
- Yes, sir.

52:24.541 --> 52:27.210
- Did he say anything or
speak anything

52:27.210 --> 52:29.045
while these actions occurred?

52:29.045 --> 52:31.314
Yeah. Some kind of incantation.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.549
- Do you remember any of it?

52:32.549 --> 52:35.685
- Yeah, it was like, uh,
uh, dada,

52:35.685 --> 52:37.854
or doo doo, dada doo doo,
or no,

52:37.854 --> 52:39.122
maybe doo doo came first.

52:39.122 --> 52:42.259
Doo doo, dada, doo doo, uh,
Scooby-Doo,

52:42.259 --> 52:44.227
uh, yabba-dabba-doo.

52:48.398 --> 52:50.100
- My word.

52:50.100 --> 52:52.702
This is, I believe, the
Talisman of Souls.

52:53.970 --> 52:55.939
- Hmm. Interesting.

52:55.939 --> 52:57.107
- What?

52:57.107 --> 52:59.242
- The smoke burns as it
fills my lungs.

52:59.242 --> 53:00.710
I've never had a
cigarette before,

53:00.710 --> 53:02.445
and I feel like I'm gonna
vomit my entrails out.

53:02.445 --> 53:03.880
(Onyx retches)
- Okay.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.017
Uh, we really have to
find that missing page.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.285
- The what?

53:08.285 --> 53:11.288
- In the Grimoire, after
the ritual of Abaddon,

53:11.288 --> 53:12.856
there was a warning.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.825
It stated, "Beware the
prophecy of the,"

53:15.825 --> 53:17.594
and then the next page
was missing.

53:19.095 --> 53:20.564
- I think I saw
the missing page.

53:20.564 --> 53:21.831
- You did?
- Where?

53:21.831 --> 53:23.333
- It was taped behind the
painting.

53:23.333 --> 53:26.036
I saw it when Jesminder was
getting zoinked and mcgoink'd.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.470
- Goodnight, honored guests.

53:27.470 --> 53:29.573
Please retire to your
individual quarters

53:29.573 --> 53:31.641
and meet downstairs in
the morning,

53:31.641 --> 53:34.578
for tomorrow we will prepare
for our second ritual.

53:35.579 --> 53:36.446
- Ah, that's it.

53:39.683 --> 53:43.019
- Which will lead us one
step closer to immortality.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.491
- During the second ritual,
one of us

53:48.491 --> 53:51.228
sneaks off to retrieve
the missing page.

53:51.228 --> 53:55.365
That page might help me put all
these puzzle pieces together

53:55.365 --> 53:57.968
and uncover what awaits us.

53:57.968 --> 54:01.304
Something tells me that
Bartok and delegate

54:01.304 --> 54:04.140
have a puzzle of their
own to solve.

54:04.140 --> 54:08.044
Let's just hope we solve
ours first.

54:09.713 --> 54:14.718
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

54:15.986 --> 54:18.855
- Welcome to the Ritual of
the Box Demon.

54:18.855 --> 54:22.559
You will each enter
this room alone, empty,

54:22.559 --> 54:25.462
except for a peculiar
wooden box.

54:25.462 --> 54:27.530
Open the doors to that box.

54:27.530 --> 54:30.800
There you will confront a
small yet powerful demon.

54:30.800 --> 54:34.271
To this demon you will
unburden yourself.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.974
Share with it a secret that
weighs heavily on your heart.

54:39.776 --> 54:41.011
Yes, Mackenzie?

54:41.011 --> 54:42.379
- Where's Jesminder?

54:42.379 --> 54:43.813
I mean, don't we need her
for the ritual?

54:43.813 --> 54:45.282
- Yeah.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.652
- Jesminder is helping
our master with something

54:48.652 --> 54:49.986
of great importance.

54:51.921 --> 54:53.723
A preparation for the

54:56.393 --> 54:57.861
final ritual.

54:59.429 --> 55:03.767
In exchange for that secret,
you will request a truth.

55:03.767 --> 55:04.834
Ask wisely.

55:06.036 --> 55:08.805
Ask for an answer that
no one could give you.

55:09.906 --> 55:13.176
No one except for our
Eternal Father.

55:14.544 --> 55:18.114
But beware, for the truth
this creature speaks

55:18.114 --> 55:20.317
is not for the faint of heart.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.952
For what he knows about
you could challenge

55:22.952 --> 55:24.621
the very essence of self

55:25.989 --> 55:29.893
and untether you with a singular
devastating proclamation.

55:29.893 --> 55:32.595
(dramatic music)

55:34.197 --> 55:35.298
Yes, Marcus?

55:35.298 --> 55:37.834
- I gotta take a big ol' shit.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.737
- Now?
- Um, let me check.

55:40.737 --> 55:44.941
(groans) Yeah, now. For sure.

55:44.941 --> 55:46.843
- Fine, then go. We'll start
without you.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.745
But if you're not back
before your turn,

55:48.745 --> 55:50.980
by Satan's unholy name, you
will be rendered ineligible

55:50.980 --> 55:53.516
and ejected from Bartok's
mansion post-haste.

55:53.516 --> 55:54.951
- Got it.

55:54.951 --> 55:58.121
Shit quick else be deemed
unworthy.

55:59.322 --> 56:01.925
- Mackenzie, would you
like to go first?

56:02.892 --> 56:03.727
- I'd be honored.

56:05.462 --> 56:10.467
(door clanging)
(Shelley giggles)

56:14.404 --> 56:17.340
(Shelley giggling)

56:19.709 --> 56:22.479
(dramatic music)

56:27.183 --> 56:29.953
(door squeaking)

56:37.327 --> 56:39.362
(bats squealing)

56:39.362 --> 56:41.164
- (coughs) Goddammit.

56:41.164 --> 56:44.167
How are all these cobwebs
at exactly mouth level?

56:49.139 --> 56:51.908
(dramatic music)

56:57.046 --> 57:00.150
- Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

57:00.150 --> 57:02.986
Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

57:02.986 --> 57:05.388
Keeping it beefy.
Keeping it beefy.

57:05.388 --> 57:06.222
- [Onyx] Huh.

57:07.457 --> 57:09.993
(door squeaks)

57:13.263 --> 57:14.964
(Mack sobs)
- Yes.

57:16.299 --> 57:19.502
The box demon speaks directly
to your soul's cradle.

57:19.502 --> 57:23.673
Steady yourselves and steel
your nerves for his truths.

57:23.673 --> 57:24.507
Mr. Duke.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.714
(door squeaks)

57:38.888 --> 57:39.923
- I'm ready to go in.

57:41.057 --> 57:42.292
- [Farrah] Hmm.

57:43.693 --> 57:45.695
- [Onyx] (grunts) Gotta
get back for the box demon.

57:45.695 --> 57:48.398
Gotta get back for the
box demon.

57:48.398 --> 57:50.066
- [Mr. Duke] Uh-huh.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.170
(door slams)

57:54.170 --> 57:56.840
- Oh, how's it going down here
with all the box demon stuff?

57:58.541 --> 58:01.611
- Shelley.
(Shelley squeals)

58:04.080 --> 58:05.648
- I gave him the page.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.050
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yep.

58:07.050 --> 58:09.786
(dramatic music)

58:13.022 --> 58:15.458
(Shelley screams)
Oh!

58:15.458 --> 58:18.228
- [Shelley] You've shattered
my mind!

58:18.228 --> 58:21.264
Oh, oh, there's a raccoon
in the car!

58:21.264 --> 58:23.867
(door squeaks)

58:27.036 --> 58:29.873
(Shelley sobbing)

58:34.811 --> 58:36.946
- Whatever's going on in there
must be pretty heavy stuff.

58:36.946 --> 58:38.214
(laughs) It's probably
for the better

58:38.214 --> 58:39.949
that I emptied out my
system first.

58:41.784 --> 58:42.585
- [Shelley] No, don't ever
let go. Don't ever let go.

58:44.687 --> 58:48.124
(door squeaks and slams)

58:51.928 --> 58:54.597
(chiming music)

58:57.200 --> 59:00.370
- Go to him. Go to your master.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.906
(Shelley sobs)

59:09.212 --> 59:11.047
- Shelley, where are you going?

59:12.882 --> 59:15.251
- She's going to her master.
She's in quite a state.

59:15.251 --> 59:16.920
- Yeah, we all are, but
I think it'd be better

59:16.920 --> 59:18.855
if we just stay together,
I mean, right, Shelley?

59:18.855 --> 59:20.757
Stay with me.
- I...

59:20.757 --> 59:23.660
- Mackenzie, please. We
all have free will here.

59:23.660 --> 59:24.794
- I'm not gonna let him
do to her what he did

59:24.794 --> 59:26.763
to Jesminder, you hear me?

59:27.964 --> 59:29.966
- Jesminder?
Whatever could you mean?

59:29.966 --> 59:32.368
- Yes, Mack,
whatever could you mean?

59:35.238 --> 59:37.740
Shelley, he's ready for
you now.

59:37.740 --> 59:39.842
- What the fuck?

59:39.842 --> 59:42.579
- [Shelley] I want
to see Bartok.

59:43.613 --> 59:45.682
- Wait here for your friend.

59:45.682 --> 59:48.418
(dramatic music)

59:53.056 --> 59:55.825
(cabinet squeaks)

59:55.825 --> 59:58.561
(box demon coos)

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.231
- Come closer, my son.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:07.770
Closer.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:14.243
(box demon groans and sneezes)

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.981
(Onyx gasps)

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.482
Let it in, my son.

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.051
Let it in.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:27.123
Now, won't you feed me a
secret, Marcus?

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.094
- I dunno.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.695
- Dig deep, my son.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.834
Go to the darkest, most
shameful parts of you.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.603
What is there?

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.773
- Oh, uh, I guess,

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.177
huh.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.382
Sex?

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.916
- Yes.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:58.788
What do you see when you think
of your most carnal desires?

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.226
- Well, I guess I think
about my,

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.863
my fantasies.
- Ooh.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.531
Tell me more.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:12.568
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what's buried
in the core

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.671
of your chamber of shame?

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.540
- Uh, yeah, my shame-ber?

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.178
Uh, well, my deepest,
darkest fantasies

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:24.981
revolve around a series
of fan fiction I wrote.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:27.483
Short novellas really,
based on Gadget Hackwrench

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.951
from "Chip 'n Dale's
Rescue Rangers."

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:31.988
- Oh, yes.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.990
- In it, I play a mix
between Dale

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.259
and Marky Mark's character
from "Boogie Nights."

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.195
I call myself Dale Diggler.
(laughs)

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.464
And, uh, let's just say
the things we get to fixing

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.099
in the Ranger Plane after
hours,

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.603
well, (laughs) yeah, it's more
than just rusty propellers.

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:50.073
(Onyx laughs)

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.744
'Cause eventually she
starts fixing my wiener.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.747
- (laughs) Mm. Tasty.

01:01:57.747 --> 01:02:02.652
Num, num, num. That secret
will do.

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:07.123
Now, what truth do you seek?

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.095
- Anything?

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:13.863
- Anything.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.474
- Oh, demon in a box,
how I beg of you.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:28.111
Oh, demon in a box, please
answer me true.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:31.614
Oh, demon in a box, how I
wish to see

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:38.788
why my father Carl left my
mother and me.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.594
- [Box Demon] Oh, Marcus.
Don't you know?

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.231
It was because of you.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.003
- What?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.908
- [Box Demon] You simply
weren't enough.

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:02.612
You weren't enough to keep
him there.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:07.049
Weren't enough to keep
them together.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:12.121
Think hard, go deep.
You'll remember.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.327

Get a job in a sideshow!

When will you be back?

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:06.175
- I don't know.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.611
(door slams)

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.650

I don't know. I don't know.

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.688
I dunno. I dunno.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.756
I dunno. I dunno.

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.325

I dunno I dunno.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.161
I dunno.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:29.732
- Did you find the answers
you sought, young one?

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.601
- Oh, yeah. (laughs)
We're good.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.768
Thanks, little demon dude.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.538
- Now, if you-
(cabinet slams)

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:42.011
- Onyx, are you okay? What
did the demon say to you?

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.579
- Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm good.

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.248
He actually said a bunch
of cool stuff to me.

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.749
He was like, "I bet you
got a big ol' wiener,

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.351
and you probably fuck a
lot too."

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.086
So yeah, I just wanted
to celebrate

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:52.521
all the cool stuff he said.
(laughs)

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:55.258
(dramatic music)

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.496
- Well, Mr. Duke wants
us to rendezvous with him

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:01.831
to discuss his findings.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.099
He's been deciphering the
prophecy, and-

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.301
- Oh, cool. Yeah, prophecies
are so fun.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.270
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's rendezvous.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.806
(Onyx chugging)

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.610
(Mack sighs)

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:21.050
(Onyx chugging)

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:28.090
- Onyx, maybe you wanna
slow down a little.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.659
- Loud and clear, boss.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:34.664
- "It is foretelling a
prophecy that will disrupt

01:05:36.732 --> 01:05:38.868
the rising of Abaddon.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:43.873
Beware the prophecy of
the unexpected,"

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.474
no, "unforeseen."

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.613
Oh, come on, John.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.417
"Beware the prophecy of the,

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:01.824
of the Fortuitous One."

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:03.326
- What?
- What?

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.394
- What?
- What?

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.164
(Shelley yells)
- What?

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.199
(Shelley whimpers)

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.167
- Nothing, I-

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.637
(Shelley thuds)

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.006
- That's right.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.176
Give me everything.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:26.148
Every last drop.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:29.251
(Shelley whimpering)

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:35.891
- Onyx, what did you call
yourself when we first met?

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.626
- Huh? Oh, I don't remember.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:40.730
- It was Onyx the Fortuitous,
wasn't it?

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.898
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nah, nah, nah.

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.700
I might have said Onyx the
Fortunate One,

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.570
because I am ever so fortunate
to have won this contest

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.773
and be invited here to be with
all of you wonderful people.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.375
(Onyx chugging)

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.642
- What else does it say?

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.312
I mean, what happens if
the ritual is disrupted?

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:57.246
What happens if it isn't?

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:59.849
- I, I, I, I, I don't know.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.417
I need more time with the page.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.085
There, there's so much here.

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:04.086
- Onyx, if you...

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:08.324
(Mack sighs)

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:13.329
(lively music)
(Onyx chugging)

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.501
Onyx, what are you doing?

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.837
- Huh? Oh, I'm just
trying to relax. (laughs)

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:24.373
I mean, all this talk of
demons and prophecies,

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:28.210
I mean, whoo, it is too
mooch. (laughs)

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:31.013
And I just wanna party.
Don't you?

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.582
I mean, everyone's so stuffy
here, right?

01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:37.453
Bartok and Farrah and all
their fucking bullshit.

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:41.490
Huh? All their fucking
bullshitty robes.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.025
And they're dumb-dumb hats.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:47.763
I mean, what kind of dumb-dumb
wears a hat like this?

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:50.299
It's stupid. And this.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:55.271
Fuck this goofy-ass emerald
bullshit.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.407
- It's, it's peridot.

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.143
- Well, fuck this peridot
bullshit.

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:03.012
(necklace chimes)

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.181
(Onyx chugs)

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.850
(ghoul gasping)

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:14.857
(laughs) Dancing makes me
feel so alive! (laughs)

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:18.327
(Onyx chugging)

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.432
- What's happening?

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.968
- I don't think he liked
what the demon said to him.

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:27.603
- Ah. You know what's weird?

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.006
No one has danced since
we got here.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:33.642
And that's a real shame, huh?

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:36.545
'Cause dancing really
frees you up, huh?

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:40.583
Dancing gets you loose, (laughs)
gets you outta your head.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:44.920
Farrah, you wanna dance
with me? Come on, baby.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.590
(laughs) Nah? All right,
that's fine.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.892
I can dance by myself. (laughs)

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:54.163
Oh, yeah, she gets it. Come on.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:57.566
Let it take you over. Let
the rhythm take you over.

01:08:57.566 --> 01:09:00.035
Rhythm take you over.

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.071
Oh, fuck. She's a ghoul.
(laughs)

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.306
- What, what did he say?

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:07.042
- He said, "Oh, fuck,
she's so cool."

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.646
(Onyx chugging)

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.554
Onyx, how much of that
did you drink?

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.024
- I don't know.

01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:25.561
(Onyx thuds)

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:30.766

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.039

- [Farrah] Here we can be
anything, Onyx.

01:11:02.157 --> 01:11:04.560
I can be whatever your heart
desires most.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.697

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:37.393
- No. Oh, God, no.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:40.462
- Then be with me. Free
me from Bartok's rule.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.563
- Schwa?

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:45.267
- He raised me from the
depths, gave me life.

01:11:45.267 --> 01:11:48.570
but a life of enslavement
is no life at all.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.907
I can be given a new life by
the one the prophecy speaks of.

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:54.009
Together you and I can
defeat Bartok.

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:56.378
But if we don't, he will
complete the final ritual

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:59.548
and use the power of Abaddon
to take the souls of millions.

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.384
But if you and I-
(growling)

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.153
Oh, no. It's too late.

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:09.058
He found us.
- Who?

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:12.127
- Abaddon.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:16.098
- [Abaddon] Come to me,
patty slinger.

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:20.769
Come to me. (growls)

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.374
(dramatic music)

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:30.245
(Abaddon growling)

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.854
- How can I make your day a
bit beefier?

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:42.491
- Marcus J. Trillbury,

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.095
we meet at last.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:50.833
I've heard so much about you.

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:57.673
The patty slinger. The virgin.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:01.744
The fool. Know this, Marcus.

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.513
You are many things,

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:08.717
but you are not the
Fortuitous One.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.055
I have seen the
Fortuitous One.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:19.061
Does that look like you,
Onyx the Fart-uitous?

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:25.634
(creature squelching)

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:26.468
Does it?

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.438
- No, sir, it does not.

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:33.142
- In less than one day's time,

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:38.147
I will rise through an unholy
vessel and enslave the Earth.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.417
Face it, patty slinger,

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:45.621
your time is up. (roars)

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:49.691
(Onyx screams)
(Abaddon laughs)

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:54.696
There's nowhere to run.
(laughs)

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:57.332
Patty slinger. Patty slinger.

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:03.939
I'm coming to get you,
patty slinger. (laughs)

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:13.048
How can I make your day
a bit beefier? (laughs)

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:21.390
When in doubt, skewer it out.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.359
Yahhh!
- Jesus!

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.194
Jesus!

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:28.363
- Hey, it's okay, Onyx.

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.098
It's all right. Lay, lay down.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:30.933
You're all right.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.868
Here, drink this.

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:35.904
- What is it?

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:40.509
- Ginger, turmeric, mint,
elder flower,

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:43.111
some other things that'll
help your stomach.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:49.818
- I'm sorry, Zee. I don't
know what came over me.

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:51.887
- It's all good.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.590
Uh, your little episode
was the perfect distraction

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.825
Mr. Duke needed to work
on his translations.

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.295
- Oh, sick.
(stomach gurgles)

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.830
Mm.
- Drink.

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.235
I spent some time in the walls.

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.071
This place is a maze.

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:13.308
Dozens of corridors all
leading somewhere different.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.145
- Thanks for taking
care of me, Zee.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.017
- That's what friends
are for, Onyx.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:25.354
- Oh, yeah. For sure.

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.992
Yeah, I know what friends are

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:33.795
and what their general
responsibilities consist of.

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:36.431
(Mack cries)

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.034
(somber music)

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:44.306
Zee, are you okay?

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.410
- No, I, um,

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:55.050
I feel stupid, Onyx.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.556
Stupid for trusting Bartok.

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:04.059
Trusting anyone, really.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.896
I should have known better.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:11.567
And I'm,

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.105
I'm scared.

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.576
I'm really scared.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.179
(solemn music)

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.253
- I used to get scared
whenever I'd go on sleepovers.

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.691
Even to my best friend
Billy Davis's house.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:40.195
'Cause it all felt so
weird and unfamiliar.

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:46.501
That's when his mom,
Linda, taught me that song.

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:52.307
And just like Fievel, my
fears would be soothed

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.310
and I'd be asleep in no time.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:03.118
'Cause she reminded me that
no matter how alone we feel,

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:09.558
no matter how far away
from home we might be,

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.997
we're still underneath the
same sky as the people we love.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.434
Just remember,
you do have friends.

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:22.838
And you're never really alone.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.742
Because we're all under
the same moon.

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:32.648
(Mack chuckles)

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:39.821
- That's all you saw
in the dream,

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.790
the chubby one playing
the piano

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.559
and smashing mirrors
with a cane?

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:48.530
- Yes. What I saw is what
I told you.

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.100
- Hmm.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.870
(ghoul wheezing)

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:00.442
Farrah?

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:03.612
- Yes, master?

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:09.785
- Why do you insist on
mocking my intelligence,

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:14.589
undermining my power,
deriding my virility?

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.925
- Master, I-
- Do you not think

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.093
he speaks to me?

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:24.366
Do you not think Lucifer
himself speaks directly to me?

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:26.935
To me!

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:32.240
Or a succubus shrew who
sleeps in a shed?

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.548
Give it to me.
(Farrah moans)

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.783
Put it in my hand.

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.285
Put it in my hand.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:52.127
(Bartok grunts)
(the figurine shatters)

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:54.863
(dramatic music)

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.939
What's the point of having a
psychic demon bitch's power

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:09.544
at my disposal if all she
does is fucking lie to me?

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:13.582
- I didn't lie to you, master.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:17.786
- Oh, no, you just chose
not to tell me

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.288
that you sensed something
when they first arrived.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:22.057
You just chose not to tell me

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:24.192
when they witnessed the
taking of a soul.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:27.863
You just chose not to
tell me that they stole

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:32.868
the fucking prophecy right
from underneath our noses!

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.404
(ghouls wheezing)

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:40.308
Now, if you don't tell
me what you're sensing,

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:44.946
what you're seeing when
you see it, I swear to you-

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.915
(metal clangs)
(Farrah gasps)

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:51.920
I will take this fucking
life from you.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.290
- You can't kill a demon
with the Knife of Dagon.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.827
- You know what? I know that
I can't kill you with this.

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:03.498
But what I can do is
sever your fucking head

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:07.235
and put it in a display
case for all eternity,

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.905
shielded in unbreakable
Nazarene glass.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.707
That I can do!

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.145
- He is here.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.116
- Who?

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.751
- The Fortuitous One.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:26.121
(dramatic music)

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.690
(bright music)

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:38.700
(bright music continues)

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:45.073
(Mr. Duke whispering
indistinctly)

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:47.876
- Yes.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:50.712
Yes, that's it.

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.781
That's it. I see it now.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:53.782
I see it all now.

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:59.120
(laughs) Outstanding.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.455
- It's the teacher, isn't it?

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:04.292
- Mm-mm. The patty slinger.

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:08.296
- Oh, fucking right.

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:10.131
(object clattering)

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:11.700
How dare you?

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.302
You still try to make a fool
out of me?

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.439
- No, I swear, I saw him.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.244
- You saw the man of destiny,

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.882
the demon killer, the
slayer of the bright realm?

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.586
- Here within these walls.

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:34.189
(dramatic music)

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.758
(Bartok gasps)

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.496
One more lie,

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.700
and I swear.

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.972
- It was the teacher. You
were right, I was wrong.

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.241
I just wasn't seeing as
clearly as you.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:56.444
(dramatic music)
(Farrah sighs)

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.412
- I knew it.

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:04.886
(Farrah growling)

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:16.364
I have no doubt our Father
looks down upon you in shame.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.836
(ghoul grunts)

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.107
(dramatic music)

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:33.581
(knocking)
- Yes?

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.917
- [Bartok] Mr. Duke,
I wondered

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.652
if you had a moment to spare.

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:52.500
- Of course. I would
be honored.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.040
- Wow.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:06.781
You really are a man
of studies, aren't you?

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:10.218
- Well, what can I say?
Knowledge excites me.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.321
- I can see that.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:20.996
So tell me, what knowledge

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:25.834
have you discovered tonight?

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:32.540
- That you are not the
person you've said you are,

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.976
and that your plans for
us, hmm,

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:38.513
well, they aren't what
we were led to believe.

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:44.719
- (laughs) Well, that
is a matter

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:48.156
of perspective, isn't it?

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:53.294
After all, I am offering
you immortality.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:24:00.835
- (chuckles) You only gain
Abaddon's power

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.372
by offering the demon
five souls.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.242
We would live eternally,

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.711
as your prisoners,

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.681
locked within the talisman
until the end of time.

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:17.385
Immortality.

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:22.390
No, undying pain and suffering

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.592
as we remain cognizant

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.529
of our never-ending state
of purgatorial stasis.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:31.833
Now, that, that is more
like it, yes?

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:36.471
- Eh. Tomato, tah-mah-toe.

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:41.443
(dramatic music)
(Mr. Duke yells)

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:46.648
(ominous music)

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:52.353
(Mr. Duke yells)
(Mack gasps)

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.289
(Mr. Duke hums)
(door squeaks)

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.758
- Mr. Duke, are, are you
okay? What did you find?

01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.726
- Oh, don't be silly.
Of course I'm fine.

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:01.629
And I found nothing.
Nothing but the truth.

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.833
That we should follow
Bartok's words to the letter

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.968
and join him for the
final ritual.

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:09.104
Right fucking now.

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:14.375
- Are you seeing regular
Mr. Duke or ghoul Mr. Duke?

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.144
- What? Regular.

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:20.215
- Huh. Because he's
definitely a ghoul now.

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:22.784
(Mr. Duke growls)

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.452
We should run!

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:27.088
(Mr. Duke growling)

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:28.756
- [Mack] Come on.

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:31.226
(Onyx shrieks)
(Mr. Duke growling)

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:34.229
- Keep your mouth closed. These
cobwebs are something fierce.

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:36.097
Oh, fuck. Are you getting
them or nah?

01:25:36.097 --> 01:25:38.800
Just me? I'm fucking
choking on webs.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.971
(door rattles and squeaks)

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.740
Why could I see the ghoul
and you couldn't. Huh?

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.642
Why could I see the
ghoul and you couldn't?

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.944
- Stand guard. I need to
study this.

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:52.447
(Onyx groans)

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.184
Okay, Mr. Duke.

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.253
The peridot necklaces.

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.492
These crystals. Farrah's been
using them to control us.

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.895
Influence our will.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.801
- Well, what else does it say?

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:15.036
Did Mr. Duke have a plan?

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.705
Huh? What do we do?

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:20.808
- Yeah, he had a plan.
- What's the plan?

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.644
Do we reanimate one of these
dead bobcats

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:24.512
and ride it straight
outta town?

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:26.481
Or do we race this old
dentist's chair downhill

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.316
until it picks up enough
speed to shoot us

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:31.953
into space like "Radio Flyer"?
(whimpers)

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:36.457
Or do we light this place on
fire and perish in the flames?

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.393
Or build a makeshift
cannon out of paperclips

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:41.729
and old white out that
we find in Bartok's desk?

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:44.499
- No.
(dramatic music)

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:50.705
I stay here and you go.

01:26:52.407 --> 01:26:55.376
- What? Go where?

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.678
Stay here? Why?

01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:00.215
- Follow the map to get out
and head to the old cemetery.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:01.382
Find the fallen angel.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.684
Once the blood moon has risen,

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.752
that's where the final
ritual will take place.

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:07.522
- What? They're gonna kill
you, Zee.

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:08.790
Suck out your soul like
some kind

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:11.092
of demonic Dyson set on
overdrive.

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:14.462
- Listen, everything you
need is in here.

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.465
- What's gonna happen?

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:25.139
(lips smack)

01:27:25.139 --> 01:27:28.009
- You have everything you need.

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.211
- No! Zee, don't do this!

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.879
Don't do this! Don't leave me!

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:34.115
Don't leave me! I can't do
this alone!

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:37.485
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not the Fortuitous One.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.554
I'm just a fat fucking
patty slinging chubby

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.857
fat fucking virgin.
(door slams)

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:43.691
Zee!

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:46.160
Zee!

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:51.032
(liquid dripping)

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.743
(ominous music)

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.448
(microphone squeals)
- Paging. Mr. Bartok.

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:09.817
Paging Mr. Bartok, I'm in
your office

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:11.219
fucking up your shit.

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.587
What you gonna do about it?

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:18.526
(glass shattering)
(objects clattering)

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.297
(dramatic music)

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:25.633
(thunder crashes)

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:28.303
(ominous music)

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.639
Bartok, where are you?

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.343
Come and get me!
(glass shatters)

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:40.348
(Onyx panting)
(crickets chirping)

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.984
(eerie music)

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:49.791
(objects clattering)

01:28:49.791 --> 01:28:52.627
(glass crunching)

01:28:57.031 --> 01:28:59.767
(dramatic music)

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:06.474
(ethereal music)

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:16.050
(ethereal music continues)

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:24.292
- [Mr. Duke Voiceover] Dear
Onyx, if you are reading this,

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:26.627
I know things must seem
pretty grim.

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.598
It looks as though you
are all alone

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:34.769
facing something insurmountable.

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:38.539
But I assure you, that
isn't the case.

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:43.544
We, your friends, are with you.

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:47.081
The prophecy of the
Fortuitous One is clear.

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:50.284
If the souls are collected
underneath the blood moon,

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:53.721
a portal will open
leading directly

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.857
to Abaddon's lair in hell.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:30:00.428
If the Fortuitous One throws
themselves into the pit,

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:03.798
they will not only be
reborn from beyond,

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:06.934
they will also have the
power to reanimate

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:10.304
the ones who have perished
by the Knife of Dagon.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.543
All of this must be done under
the gaze of the blood moon,

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:18.946
lasting only 300 seconds.

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.951
That's five minutes.
- Got it.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.052
(dramatic music)
(Mack grunts)

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.621
- Ade due Damballa.

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:31.225
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.660
Ade due Damballa.

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.831
Give me the power,
I beg of you!

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:39.801
Ade due Damballa.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:46.607
Give me the power-
♪ Somewhere ♪

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:49.510
♪ Out there ♪

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:54.315
(knife slams)
(Mack screams)

01:30:54.315 --> 01:30:56.984
- [Mr. Duke Voiceover] Onyx,
I cannot say whether or not

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:59.554
you are the one the
prophecy speaks of.

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:03.024
That could not be
determined by my studies.

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:06.394
You must search within yourself

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:08.996
and find what you know
in your heart to be true.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:13.468
However, if you are not the
Fortuitous One

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.870
and you throw yourself
into the hell mouth,

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:19.407
you will burn alive as you
fall for miles and miles,

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.809
hurdling toward Abaddon's
pit deep beneath

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.945
the Earth's surface,
fully awake and aware

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.214
for the entirety of the fall.

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:29.917
Then once arriving in his lair,
undoubtedly face centuries

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:32.086
of torture at the hands
of Abaddon

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.689
and his many demonic minions.

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.690
Good luck.

01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:38.559
- Huh.

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.431
(dramatic music)

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:50.238
I have everything I need, huh?
(dramatic music)

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:58.112
(ghouls snarling)
(dramatic music)

01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.350
- Patty slinger!

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.354
The time has come.

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:10.258
The blood moon blesses us

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:14.161
and Abaddon is waiting.

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.000
(ghoul wheezing)
- Zee.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:23.271
(dramatic music)

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:29.877
- No. Kneel and accept
your fate.

01:32:34.749 --> 01:32:36.851
Put your magic to some
good use

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:39.186
and make this fool do
as I say.

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:44.392
- Kneel in the name of Bartok.

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:48.829
(Onyx grunts)

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:51.198
- Now we can begin.

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.002
Father, hear me.

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:57.872
I have done as you have asked.

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:02.176
The talisman of souls is
nearly full.

01:33:02.176 --> 01:33:06.414
You have commanded,
and I have obeyed.

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:12.553
With this final offering,
we make way for Abaddon.

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:21.562
It's sad. For you, I mean.

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:26.434
But they're not really
in there anymore.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.436
They're in here.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.172
(dramatic music)

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:38.145
Do you know how I know

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:41.816
you aren't the Fortuitous One,
Marcus?

01:33:42.683 --> 01:33:46.754
Because you don't impress me.

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:52.793
(knife slams)
(Onyx groaning)

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.397
Farrah, the book.

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:59.133
(dramatic music)

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:03.037
Ade due Damballa.

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:08.275
Give me the power, I beg of you.

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:12.613
Secoise entienne mais
pois de morte.

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.015
Ade due Damballa.

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:19.420
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.423
Secoise entienne
mais pois de morte.

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.193
Ade due Damballa.

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:31.232
Give me the power,
I beg of you!

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:36.037
Secoise entienne mais
pois de morte!

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.909
Rise, Abaddon! Come to me!

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:44.879
Give me power!

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:49.884
(dramatic music)

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.189
- Hey, Bartok!

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.125
I just wanted to tell
you something real quick

01:34:58.125 --> 01:35:00.027
before all my soul goo is gone.

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.230
Hey, I just wanted to say
(indistinct whispering).

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:08.903
- What?

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.604
I was just trying to tell
you (whispers indistinctly).

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:18.179
- What are you saying,
patty slinger?

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.149
- Uh, this isn't one of Farrah's
crystals at all. (chuckles)

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.218
It's an ultra green
pumaman variant.

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.120
Surprised you didn't know that.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.856
So I'm free to do
whatever the fuck I want.

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.024
(head thuds)

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:33.360
(Bartok and Onyx groan)

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:37.998
Oh. Oh!

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:41.068
How deep does that hole go?

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:45.005
Well, here goes nothing.

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:48.709
(Onyx yells)

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.716
- My life's work!

01:35:55.716 --> 01:35:58.252
Gone, in a flash,

01:35:58.252 --> 01:36:01.722
because you wouldn't
do as you were told.

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.791
You couldn't keep them in line.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.025
You couldn't protect years

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:11.999
of my work for one fucking
weekend! (sobs)

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:17.104
I've spent my life
preparing for this one night.

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:23.811
(Bartok sobs)

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.615
- [Ghouls] Let him rise.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:30.384
Let him rise.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.221
Let him rise.

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.259
- What?
- Let him rise.

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:41.529
- What?
- Let him rise.

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:47.868
- What are they saying?
Why are they saying that?

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:50.805
(flames crackling)

01:36:57.311 --> 01:37:00.214
(triumphant music)

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:13.494
(triumphant music continues)

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.901
- I stand before you now
not as the man you once

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.970
knew me to be, but as a
man revivified,

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.972
no longer made of earthly
flesh and bone,

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:26.740
but rather built of
supernatural sinew

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.210
and metaphysical muscle, not
unlike the genetic builds

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.978
of angels and demons
that wage forever war

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:33.314
in opposing kingdoms,
battling over the fates

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:35.649
of monsters and mites
until both time and space

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:40.087
stretch to bleak nothingness
and the stars refuse to expand.

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:42.189
But for what is this
battle raging, you ask.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.158
I dunno. What stands at
the center?

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.126
To that I say my soul is at
the center,

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:49.263
for I am Onyx the Fortuitous,
slayer of the bright realm,

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.799
an altered warrior destined
to return my friends' souls

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:55.636
to their bodies and seal this
weeping hell portal thusly.

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:59.139
(majestic music)

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:03.444
I dunno. Being reborn is
pretty cool.

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:06.780
(dramatic music)

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.450
(Bartok groans)

01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:13.287
Not much time left!

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:16.490
Quick, ghoul buddies,
single file.

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:19.426
(triumphant music)

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:24.331
- Farrah, please!
(shovel thuds)

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.267
- Our Father was wrong to
choose you.

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:29.236
His faith in foolish men
never ceases to amaze me.

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:33.707
- Is this how you repay me
after all I've done for you?

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:35.409
(ghouls gurgling)

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.877
- This is gonna feel weird
at first,

01:38:36.877 --> 01:38:39.346
but then it'll feel good 'cause
you'll get your souls back.

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:42.349
(laughs) When in doubt,
skewer it out.

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:47.321
(dramatic music)
(ghouls yelling)

01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:49.523
- What are you going to do?

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:53.027
Kill me?
- No. Worse.

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:55.562
Klaatu barada nikto.

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:58.399
(ghouls groaning)

01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:04.972
(blood squelching)
(Bartok gurgles)

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.776
(ghouls moaning)

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:12.780
(ghoul yells)

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:14.048
I guess that's what you get
for trusting

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:16.150
a psychic demon bitch.

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.852
(dramatic music)

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:24.858
- [Onyx] Hmm.

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:28.796
- Now's the time, Onyx, what
I spoke about in your dreams.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.197
- What?
- Your destiny,

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:32.633
the way forward for you, for us.

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:37.638
- Woah! You mean like a sexy
way forward?

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.606
- If the Fortuitous One
joins with a demon,

01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:41.575
they can take Abaddon's
power and rule together

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:43.110
as kings and queens in hell.

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:48.015
- Uh, when you say join with
a demon, you mean to like

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.016
get married?
- Fuck.

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:50.584
- Oh, fuck. Okay, right,
got it.

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:53.620
So reign with you in hell
and leave my friends behind,

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.491
or stay here with them and
be without my demon bride.

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.393
- I knew it was you all along.

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.095
I know you could feel me too,

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.930
guiding you, pulling
you through.

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.264
Stay with me, Onyx.

01:40:04.264 --> 01:40:05.632
Together, hell can be what
we make of it.

01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:08.535
Slave to no master, a
kingdom of our very own.

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.237
- But-

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:14.541
(ghouls moaning)

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.043
My friends.

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:17.544
- This is our last chance,
Onyx.

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.913
Be with me now or leave me
and forever be my enemy.

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.850
(suspenseful music)

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.951
- I'm sorry, Farrah,

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.954
but I can't rule with you
in hell.

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.223
My place is here.

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:32.526
With my-
(dramatic music)

01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:35.162
- With what? A band of
losers, know nothings?

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:38.165
Is that what you want over
loyalty and exaltation?

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.533
Then take your rightful
place as the leader

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:42.002
of the forever forsaken
ugly fuck-ups.

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:44.104
- Farrah!

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.540
- Farewell,
Onyx the Fortuitous.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.442
Until we meet again
in your nightmares.

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.612
(Farrah growls)

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:54.314
(dramatic music)

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.360
- Ah, you're better off
without her, Fortuitous One.

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:11.265
- Yeah, I think you're right.
Oh, shit.

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:15.769
(laughs) Y'all transformed.
That's fucking tight.

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:19.773
That is fu-, that's,
that's tight (laughs)

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.875
Yeah. And he's dead.

01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:27.381
(liquid squelches)
- [All] Aw. Huh.

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:30.384
(knocking)
- (laughs) Hello?

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:34.354
Oh, come on. Oh, you're
so bad.

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:37.825
- Welcome to Briardale Manor.

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.261
- The fuck?

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.496
(kids laughing)

01:41:42.496 --> 01:41:46.066
- (laughs) Ah, the children.
(laughs)

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:52.239
This is our room of focus
and meditation.

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.441
Currently our resident
witch is using it to hone

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:57.144
their newfound insights and
skills.

01:41:59.012 --> 01:41:59.813
- Hey.

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.083
- Hi.

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.620
- This is the study.

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.290
Here, you'll find volumes upon
volumes of satanic writings.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.925
If you've got a thirst for
knowledge,

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:15.195
it can be quenched within
these walls.

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:20.200
(Mr. Duke grunts)

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:24.738
But here is where we'll take
our lunch.

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.373
A place set for everyone.

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:31.545
Ah, I'm being summoned.
Excusez moi.

01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:34.148
(bright music)

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.285
(Nancy chuckles)

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:40.787
(bright music)

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:42.456
I'd be honored.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.469
- Oh, Mr. Duke.

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:58.372
- Wonderful. (laughs)

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:05.445
(all gasping)

01:43:05.445 --> 01:43:10.450
♪ I would do anything for love ♪

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:13.587
♪ Oh, oh ♪

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:16.456
♪ I would do anything for love ♪

01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:18.158
♪ But I won't do that ♪

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.394
- He's your kid, not mine.

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.328
(all laughing)

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.096
♪ No I won't do that ♪

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:26.433
- I love dancing!

01:43:26.433 --> 01:43:28.368
Dancing gets you loose!

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:44.351
- When? When do we get
our revenge?

01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:48.488
- Soon. But we must
have patience.

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.424
We must wait until the
time is right.

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:55.829
And when it is, we make
his life a living hell.

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:59.633
Understand?
- Yes, master.

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.602

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.364
- Maybe I'm not Mark who
works at Arby's.

01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:13.333
Maybe I'm Onyx the Fortuitous,
slayer of the bright realm.

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:14.501
I dunno.

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:15.936
I do hope his eyes
gaze upon me

01:46:15.936 --> 01:46:18.438
and that my allegiance is
recognized, I dunno.

01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:21.375
Notice me, Senpai, notice me.

01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:24.478
No, I didn't wash my shirt
in between shifts, Masha.

01:46:24.478 --> 01:46:25.879
So what if I smell like
roast beef?

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:28.215
This whole place smells like
roast beef.

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:29.683
As I stared into the
darkened void,

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.551
imagining the hordes of
devils soon to spring forth,

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:33.053
I couldn't help but ponder,

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.489
how deep does that hole go?

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.359
I was sitting on the
orange velvet couch

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.595
watching "Catteries Not
Included" when suddenly

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.864
an arousingly confident
Gadget Hackwrench appeared

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.465
and asked for my help in fixing

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.167
the ever-beleaguered
Screaming Eagle.

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:49.236
I don't know. I acquiesced.

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:51.738
And as I handed her the hog
ring pliers, her fuzzy digits

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:56.376
grazed mine, and in that
moment, truly, I was woke.

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.880
But with one last look of a
warrior's accord, we vaulted,

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.415
vaulted higher than
Meat Loaf's motorcycle

01:47:01.415 --> 01:47:03.884
bursting through the devilish
graveyard's stony sod,

01:47:03.884 --> 01:47:05.719
and just like the Loaf,
we soared.

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:08.355
And just like the Loaf,
we sang.
