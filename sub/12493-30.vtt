00:04.375 --> 00:05.208
Okay.

00:05.625 --> 00:08.166
Hey, Dad, can I go away with Ivy
and her family this weekend?

00:08.250 --> 00:10.333
Ivy says they have a nice house
on the lake.

00:10.417 --> 00:11.959
A weekend getaway?

00:12.792 --> 00:15.083
House on the lake? Crackling fire?

00:15.834 --> 00:17.041
Can you bring a friend?

00:18.875 --> 00:20.208
Or a dad?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.041
Kind of...

00:22.125 --> 00:23.875
it's not a getaway unless I...

00:24.542 --> 00:25.959
get away from...

00:26.500 --> 00:27.458
Me?

00:29.583 --> 00:30.458
Thanks for understanding.

00:30.542 --> 00:31.417
Have fun.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.625
Love you!

00:33.542 --> 00:34.667
Hey, Dad.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.542
Hey, Dad.

00:39.625 --> 00:40.500
How you doin'?

00:40.792 --> 00:42.667
Anything you boys care to tell me?

00:44.792 --> 00:46.375
What makes you think
we wanna tell you something?

00:48.375 --> 00:49.375
That.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.208
Well, well, well, Mrs. Dabney.

01:01.792 --> 01:05.250
With a baseball and a satellite dish.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.542
What do I owe you?

01:08.625 --> 01:09.917
Uh, don't worry about it.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.125
I still have your credit card
number on file.

Timeout.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.250
What happened?

02:20.333 --> 02:21.375
I was bad.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.208
Can I talk to you in here for a minute?

02:25.250 --> 02:26.625
That's a timeout chair?

02:26.709 --> 02:28.583
This whole time I thought
it was just Gabe's chair.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.333
What's going on?

02:34.417 --> 02:35.792
Bob, I am so upset.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.458
Charlie said a bad word at school today.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.875
What? What did she say?

02:43.959 --> 02:44.959
Whoa!

02:47.542 --> 02:49.125
Our little girl said that?

02:49.458 --> 02:51.834
Well, apparently she was making
a macaroni necklace

02:51.917 --> 02:53.583
when some kid pushed her,

02:53.667 --> 02:56.125
knocked her macaroni on to the floor,
and out came the word.

02:56.750 --> 02:57.709
Well,

02:57.792 --> 02:59.208
at least she used it correctly.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.709
Actually, her teacher said she's swearing
at a second-grade level.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.500
I just can't picture our little angel
saying something like that.

03:09.834 --> 03:11.083
Oh, me neither.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.750
No, I'm sorry. You know what?

03:12.834 --> 03:14.750
Until I hear that myself,
I don't believe it.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.583
You're right.

03:16.667 --> 03:19.583
I mean, Charlie is the perfect combination
of all of our kids.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.834
She's got the intelligence of Teddy,

03:22.333 --> 03:23.917
the sweetness of PJ,

03:24.750 --> 03:26.041
and none of Gabe.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.250
Are they gonna do this the whole way?

03:49.250 --> 03:51.125
If you just said,
"Do they do this the whole way?"

03:51.208 --> 03:52.458
The answer is yes.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.125
So, Teddy,

03:57.667 --> 03:59.250
what do you think about the new car?

04:00.125 --> 04:02.333
- Oh, it's nice.
- Mm-hm.

04:02.625 --> 04:06.166
Bought this one right after you wrecked my
old car, Gracie, in less than 20 minutes.

04:06.792 --> 04:07.709
Remember that?

04:08.792 --> 04:09.917
Sure do.

04:13.709 --> 04:16.667
I had such a bad feeling when I saw you
drive her away that day,

04:17.417 --> 04:19.083
but I didn't say anything.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.417
I'll never forgive myself for that.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.667
Okay, um, Charlie,

04:45.709 --> 04:48.458
mommy and daddy want to talk
to you today about words.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.041
Especially new words.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.250
Okay.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.959
So let's say somebody

04:56.542 --> 04:57.792
knocked over your juice.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.333
Now what would you say to that?

05:01.709 --> 05:02.875
Oopsy.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.625
But if you really didn't like it?

05:07.667 --> 05:08.709
Uh-oh.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.583
Okay, okay, let's, uh...

05:12.667 --> 05:14.667
Let's say somebody took your juice.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.458
Huh, what would you say then?

05:18.875 --> 05:21.542
Or if somebody took your juice and then...

05:21.875 --> 05:23.333
did this all over you?

05:23.417 --> 05:25.000
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:26.542 --> 05:30.208
Are we trying to get her to say the word
or me to say the word?

05:31.959 --> 05:34.291
Bob, this is silly.

05:34.458 --> 05:35.542
I know!

05:35.834 --> 05:38.792
She's not saying it now because
she never said it in the first place.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.834
Exactly, she never said it.

05:42.792 --> 05:45.166
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go get daddy a new shirt.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.792
There we go.

05:52.792 --> 05:53.834
She said it.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.083
She said it?

05:55.166 --> 05:56.875
She dropped her doll and she said it.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.083
Oh, Charlie,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
you didn't.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.458
I did, Daddy.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.542
Won't you come in?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.250
Hey, hey, we were watching that.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.125
Too bad. My story is on.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.875
And since you broke my dish,
I'll be watching my show here.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.667
If you want some of my popcorn,
ask for it.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.083
Can I have some of your popcorn?

06:42.166 --> 06:43.125
No.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.375
So, what is this show?

06:47.458 --> 06:50.083
It's called "The Tears of Tomorrow".

06:50.291 --> 06:53.959
It's about the Tears family
of Tomorrow, Maine.

06:54.917 --> 06:58.208
In the last episode,
Chance Tears found out

06:58.291 --> 07:01.917
his seventh wife Amanda
is actually a clone.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.375
Quiet. It's starting.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.125
Narrator: From the heartaches of today,

07:11.208 --> 07:13.458
come The Tears of Tomorrow.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.625
Yeah, let's go, PJ.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.000
Whoa! Who's that?

07:20.083 --> 07:21.458
That's Tiffany Tears.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.667
All she ever wears is a tiny bikini.
It's disgusting.

07:26.959 --> 07:28.166
Sure is.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.000
Oh, and that's Brick Tears.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.333
He's Chance's 12-year-old grandson.

07:34.417 --> 07:37.166
He's a boy genius with a taste for evil.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.875
Move over!

07:41.625 --> 07:43.458
Chance: Amanda, who is this?

07:43.542 --> 07:45.166
Amanda: I'm glad you asked, Chance.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.959
This is my new boyfriend, Chauncey.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.250
Chance: What? But he looks just like me.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.667
Amanda: That's right. You're not the
only one who knows how to clone.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.458
Ooh!

07:54.750 --> 07:56.458
Man, I did not see that coming.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.792
There's brick. What's he got in his hand?

08:00.875 --> 08:02.458
Amanda: Brick, what do you have
in your hand?

08:02.542 --> 08:04.500
Chance: Brick, put that weapon down!

08:04.583 --> 08:05.500
Amanda: No!

08:05.583 --> 08:06.417
Oh!

08:08.291 --> 08:12.000
Narrator: These have been
The Tears of Tomorrow.

08:16.959 --> 08:17.834
Wait.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.250
That's it?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.583
But what about Brick?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.750
And what about Tiffany?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.917
She went to change bathing suits
and never came back.

08:25.542 --> 08:28.041
Calm down. The show's on again tomorrow.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.083
Tomorrow?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.750
I did not see that coming!

08:33.583 --> 08:35.166
All right, everybody, we're here.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.834
Where's the house?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.375
Oh, Teddy, it's right out there.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.959
That shack on the lake?

08:48.959 --> 08:49.917
Ivy,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.041
you said it was a nice house.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.000
No,

08:53.083 --> 08:55.208
I said it was an ice house.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.792
But I'll admit,
I do run my words together.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.125
Oh, yes, we made it!

09:11.208 --> 09:12.333
Well, here we are.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.709
Ooh, Teddy, let me give you the tour.

09:21.917 --> 09:22.834
Any questions?

09:23.792 --> 09:24.875
Uh, just one.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.500
Is that the bathroom?

09:28.333 --> 09:30.792
Oh, no. That's our fishing hole.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.333
That's where we catch our dinner.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.458
Ivy, could I talk to you for a sec?

09:35.917 --> 09:37.500
Let me give you girls some privacy.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.417
- Come on, Harry.
- All right, all right.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.750
You tricked me!

09:45.834 --> 09:47.834
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.

09:47.917 --> 09:50.083
Yeah, you're right.
I totally wouldn't have come!

09:50.166 --> 09:52.417
Oh, stop complaining. It's not so bad.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.166
There is a hole in the floor.

09:55.959 --> 09:57.709
Uh, everything okay in here?

09:57.792 --> 09:59.041
Oh, yes, it is.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.875
What is the point
of a curtain if she can hear us?

10:02.959 --> 10:05.125
I don't know.
And why are you still whispering?

10:05.959 --> 10:07.792
Those are two good questions.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.125
So, what did you guys
wanna talk to me about?

10:19.333 --> 10:21.250
We'll ask the questions around here.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.291
Now,

10:24.875 --> 10:27.583
why did you teach Charlie that bad word?

10:29.000 --> 10:29.959
What bad word?

10:30.291 --> 10:31.834
Don't play dumb with me!

10:33.375 --> 10:35.417
All right? We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.709
- Your choice, punk!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:38.041 --> 10:40.041
Sweetie, sweetie, why don't you
go take a break?

10:40.125 --> 10:41.333
Go take a break.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.208
Let me talk to the boy.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.291
Wo.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.375
Your old mom's pretty riled up, huh?

10:52.959 --> 10:55.125
You know, Gabe,
sometimes we make mistakes.

10:55.750 --> 10:56.917
But the important thing...

10:57.417 --> 10:58.667
is to tell the truth.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.834
You can tell your old dad
the truth, right?

11:03.291 --> 11:06.041
Dad, you can stop.
I know what you're doing.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.166
What do you mean?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.125
You're playing "Good cop, Bad cop".

11:09.208 --> 11:10.208
What...

11:10.291 --> 11:11.625
Honey, he's onto us!

11:13.875 --> 11:15.000
Oh, man!

11:15.083 --> 11:17.083
Yeah, and there's a little problem
with your theory.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.667
For me to teach Charlie a bad word,

11:18.750 --> 11:20.333
I'd actually have to spend time with her.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.166
You're free to go.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.542
Charlie said a bad word?

11:32.083 --> 11:33.417
- Mm-hm.
- What was it?

11:34.125 --> 11:35.333
We think you know.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.166
No, I don't.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.625
That's terrible.

11:47.709 --> 11:48.959
What does it mean?

11:55.208 --> 11:56.375
You're free to go.

11:58.458 --> 12:01.542
And since Charlie spends
a lot of time in our backyard,

12:02.041 --> 12:05.458
we think she might have heard something
from your side of the fence.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.250
What are you accusing me of?

12:10.417 --> 12:13.500
Charlie said a bad word and we think
she might have learned it from you.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.625
What was the word?

12:26.125 --> 12:28.208
I wasn't saying it to you!

12:28.875 --> 12:31.041
You sure won't be saying it twice.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.250
Teddy,

12:38.583 --> 12:40.500
I'd like for you to meet old Betsy.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.458
There's a little story
that goes along with her.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.834
Uh, hold on a sec, Dad.

12:46.709 --> 12:47.792
Go ahead.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.834
Betsy was a present from my grandfather.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.542
Yeah. He carved her handle
from a tree behind his house.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.792
I've had her since I was ten-years-old.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.250
Oh, all right,

13:01.917 --> 13:03.166
let's get her in the water.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.959
Harry, let Teddy do it.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.625
I don't think that's
a good idea, Mary Lou,

13:08.709 --> 13:10.542
especially after what happened to Gracie,

13:11.333 --> 13:12.792
which I've forgotten about.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.792
Harry, Teddy is our guest.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.250
- Now, make a gesture.
- I don't wanna make a gesture!

13:18.333 --> 13:19.583
He doesn't have to make a gesture.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.000
Harry, gesture!

13:24.792 --> 13:25.709
Here.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.333
All right.

13:32.667 --> 13:33.667
Cast away.

13:38.041 --> 13:39.000
Not bad...

13:39.125 --> 13:40.000
for a rookie.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.375
Thanks, I've been...

13:43.208 --> 13:44.959
holding stuff since I was little.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.458
And now...

13:48.125 --> 13:49.834
the excitement begins.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.083
Is the excitement still beginning or...

14:02.875 --> 14:03.875
are we...

14:04.542 --> 14:05.667
are we in it now?

14:07.792 --> 14:09.166
Harry, can you give me a hand?

14:09.250 --> 14:10.667
Oh, yes, yes. Good, good.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.792
Ivy: Have fun. I'm off to the restroom.

14:15.417 --> 14:16.333
Where is it?

14:17.166 --> 14:20.792
It's a nasty outhouse
all the way across the freezing lake.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.959
But it's away from my parents,
so I enjoy it.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.458
Oh!

14:35.417 --> 14:36.333
Harry: Betsy!

14:36.875 --> 14:40.166
No!

14:45.667 --> 14:47.834
Oh, no!

14:47.917 --> 14:49.959
They canceled "Tears of Tomorrow".

14:50.250 --> 14:51.125
What?

14:51.917 --> 14:54.417
But it's been on for, like, 50 years.
Why now?

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
It says our generation
doesn't respond to it.

14:56.583 --> 14:57.959
That's crazy.

14:58.041 --> 14:58.917
You know,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.583
maybe if the kids put down all the phones
and the videogames and the gadgets

15:02.667 --> 15:04.834
and actually watched the darn program...

15:07.625 --> 15:09.709
Do you think we're spending
too much time with Mrs. Dabney?

15:09.792 --> 15:10.792
Hogwash.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.083
That's her.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.458
I guess we have to tell her.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.583
Huh.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.542
Hello, boys.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.750
Mrs. Dabney,

15:29.542 --> 15:30.709
come on in.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.709
Have a seat.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.709
We have some bad news.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.041
Bad news, you say?

15:41.750 --> 15:42.625
Yes.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.792
- What is it?
- What's what?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.125
What's the bad news?

15:48.667 --> 15:49.709
You better sit down.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.125
I am sitting.

15:53.834 --> 15:54.750
Well,

15:55.208 --> 15:56.792
there's nothing left to say but...

15:57.792 --> 15:59.709
- It's over.
- What's over?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.375
They canceled...

16:03.083 --> 16:04.166
"The Tears of Tomorrow."

16:04.250 --> 16:05.041
What?

16:05.917 --> 16:06.917
No!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.125
I... uh...

16:10.166 --> 16:11.250
Did she faint?

16:11.375 --> 16:12.500
Or is she...

16:20.834 --> 16:22.750
So, all we're having for dinner is rice?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.875
Well, usually there's fish on top of it.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.375
But someone lost
our means of catching fish.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.625
And by that, I mean old Betsy.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.000
And by someone,

16:32.083 --> 16:33.208
I mean you.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.750
Mr. Wentz, I promise,
right when we get home

16:36.834 --> 16:38.417
I'll get you another fishing pole.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.375
And how are you gonna raise my grandfather
from the dead to carve it?

16:43.583 --> 16:46.250
Harry, can I talk to you for a minute
in private?

16:52.792 --> 16:54.542
Mary Lou: You have got
to change your attitude.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.875
Teddy is our guest!

16:56.166 --> 16:58.125
Harry: Mary Lou, the girl is an assassin.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.834
First she killed Gracie,
and now she's drowned Betsy!

17:04.875 --> 17:06.834
Sure glad that's a private conversation.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.625
You okay, Mrs. Dabney?

17:16.709 --> 17:18.667
I'll never be okay again.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.417
I don't know how I can go on
without Chance Tears.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.750
Well, at least you and Chance
had a lot of years together.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.125
Tiffany and I just met.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.542
All right, come on.

17:28.625 --> 17:31.208
Let's try to find something
to take our minds off our loss.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.041
Are you kidding?
I've been watching that show forever.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.125
You think I'm gonna
replace it just like that?

17:38.125 --> 17:39.000
Hey, what's this?

17:39.083 --> 17:42.500
Narrator: Though time may pass,
you will never be far

17:42.583 --> 17:45.125
from the edge of yesterday.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.166
Ooh, that looks good.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.542
I can't believe we never found out
who taught Charlie that word.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.834
I don't know, Bob. Maybe it's not
important where she learned it.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.333
What's important is that we teach Charlie
that cursing is wrong.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.375
- And I think we've done that.
- Mm-hm.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.500
How about a turn signal, you...

18:22.750 --> 18:24.208
Case closed.

18:30.959 --> 18:31.959
Ivy.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.041
Teddy: Ivy.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.125
Ivy, Ivy.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.625
What?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.333
I have to go to the bathroom. Where is it?

18:42.417 --> 18:43.834
It's an outhouse.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.834
You go outside and you follow the stench.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.792
Thank you.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.208
Whoa!

18:52.625 --> 18:54.625
- Henry: What was that?
- Teddy fell in the lake!

18:54.709 --> 18:56.583
- Mary Lou: Oh, my goodness, come on!
- Oh, Teddy!

18:56.667 --> 18:57.917
Pull! Everybody pull hard!

18:58.000 --> 18:59.583
Come on! All right, baby?

18:59.667 --> 19:00.667
Oh!

19:01.750 --> 19:03.125
Oh, what's that?

19:03.417 --> 19:04.625
What's going on?

19:04.709 --> 19:06.583
- Teddy: Ah!
- Oh! Wow.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.208
Hey, you caught a fish.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.583
Whoa, and it's a beauty.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.375
Look. Look, there's a line in its mouth.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.000
What?

19:17.041 --> 19:18.083
Oh...

19:18.166 --> 19:19.834
Oh! Betsy!

19:19.917 --> 19:21.417
Oh, I missed you so much, baby.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.125
Teddy, honey, are you okay?

19:23.208 --> 19:25.208
Yeah, no, I'm just...
I'm fine. I'm just kind of cold.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.333
Mary Lou: Okay.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.041
Well, Teddy,

19:28.125 --> 19:30.041
looks like you've redeemed yourself.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.333
You are officially invited back next year.

19:33.250 --> 19:39.041
No!

19:44.250 --> 19:45.375
Well, Charlie,

19:45.458 --> 19:46.750
big life lesson today.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.834
See, when someone says
they have a house on the lake,

19:51.375 --> 19:53.458
they might mean they have a house..

19:54.041 --> 19:55.750
on the lake.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.917
Kind of an offbeat lesson, but...

20:01.125 --> 20:02.917
Well, not really a lesson at all.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.125
Oh, give me a break.
I've gotta do a lot of these.

20:07.083 --> 20:10.041
Well, at least one person in the family
learned something.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.750
Can I go now? This is boring.

20:15.834 --> 20:16.709
No!

20:17.458 --> 20:18.333
Yeah?

20:18.417 --> 20:20.875
Well, if you think I'm gonna sit
in this chair the entire 20 minutes,

20:20.959 --> 20:22.792
Good luck, Charlie.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.667
Couldn't have said it better myself.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.917
Narrator: From the heartaches of today,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.834
come the Tears of Tomorrow.

20:32.208 --> 20:33.792
You can't threaten me.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.709
I'm Chance Tears.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.041
Hello, chance.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.375
Amanda!

20:43.500 --> 20:44.667
What are you doing here?

20:45.750 --> 20:47.291
That's what I'd like to know.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.709
Amanda clone!

20:51.417 --> 20:52.375
But...

20:54.166 --> 20:55.750
I'll handle this, chance.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.250
Chance clone!

21:02.917 --> 21:03.792
Brick!

21:06.375 --> 21:07.625
What's goin' on here?

21:08.458 --> 21:10.458
I knew this day would come.

21:10.542 --> 21:12.250
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

21:12.542 --> 21:13.625
Me, too.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.208
I'm confused.

21:15.458 --> 21:16.834
Who are the real ones?

21:17.917 --> 21:18.917
Who cares?

21:19.250 --> 21:21.417
You take two, I'll take two.

21:26.083 --> 21:29.750
Narrator: These have been
the Tears of Tomorrow.
