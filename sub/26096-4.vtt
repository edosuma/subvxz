[Dr Jones] Officer Reynolds,
another check-in already?

00:12.178 --> 00:14.431
Rook Security was already
a dangerous job,

00:14.514 --> 00:16.850
but it's gotten worse
since the Flex Fighters went rogue.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.437
Well, there is good news.
Your men have made serious progress.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.690
Conner's nearly healed,
just needs to continue physical therapy.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.276
Schwartz's cast will come off tomorrow.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.863
However, this gentleman
remains unconscious.

00:29.946 --> 00:34.784
His life signs continue to appear normal.
I believe it's a chemically-induced state.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.494
We're running more tests.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.205
We'll revive him eventually.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.208
The very instant he awakes,
contact Kane or myself.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.294
Whoever this guy is,
one thing's for certain.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.671
He's extremely dangerous.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.221
Good evening, doctor.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.640
Evening.

Well, as we learned the hard way,

02:51.963 --> 02:55.341
with Rook in charge,
nothing we see on TV can be trusted.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.886
You guys talk so casually about this.

and "Rook hates us,"

and "Oh, hey, Erika,
wanna do homework together?"

03:05.435 --> 03:07.478
Guys, I'm kinda freaked out.

03:08.104 --> 03:12.817
Rook has no idea who we really are.
Unless this stray cat is a spy.

03:13.818 --> 03:18.239
You're not a spy from Rook,
are you, Mr. Meow-Face?

03:18.323 --> 03:19.657

Oh, he'll come around.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.331
Just like you'll get used to hanging
with three baller superheroes.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.082
You mean four.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.755
Right. Four baller superheroes
who are also awesome friends, and stuff.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.176
Mr. Park, I love all these
old newspapers.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.262
There's stuff about Rook Unlimited in here
I don't think anyone remembers.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.224
It was much more difficult
to hide the truth

03:44.307 --> 03:46.517
when everything
was printed on paper.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.395

Not true. I keep a chart, and no,
you don't spend more time with her.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.663
- You keep a chart?
- No. I was kidding about that,

I got an extension on this essay
about Ancient Japan,

my second chance.

Cool if I get some snacks, Nathan?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.760
Sure. I mean, if there's anything left.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.262
I'll dig up something.

right technology in the right hands,

who stand in the way of progress.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.951
May technology bring glory to us all.

04:45.868 --> 04:49.163
We've been reconfiguring the
Rook Unlimited Tech in secret for months.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.166
But now we finally know
the location of the controller.

04:52.250 --> 04:56.212
You were right to revive me.
We must make this opportunity count.

Tell Dr. C we said hi.

No mission. Dr. C and I are taking...
a break for the next 24 hours.

A day off? You two?
Massages, drinks on the lake?

05:10.935 --> 05:13.229
A day of mourning,

-You're coming, right?
-The whole family is.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.461

-Will you show up this time?
-Definitely.

you'll actually, really be there?

I double promise.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.225
Okay, you promised.

What happened to not doing things
with my family 'cause you're afraid

some boxes.

she'd give you another chance.

and she still doesn't speak to him.

Wait, if we both go, and Riya
and Dr. C are out of town,

06:17.210 --> 06:19.754
that means Jake's
on his own for the day.

Uh-oh.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.113
[engine whines]

16:37.329 --> 16:38.956
Should have buckled up.

16:41.792 --> 16:45.546
That's weird. It's flashing, but for what?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.882
EMP countdown has begun.
Clear the area.

16:48.966 --> 16:53.554
An Electro Magnetic Pulse?
That'll destroy all the tech in the city.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.849
Why can't I access my own solar panels?

16:56.932 --> 16:57.850
[grunts]

16:57.933 --> 17:00.686
How did they hijack them?
Nobody even knew they existed.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.022
Stay on your targets.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.036
[man grunts]

17:20.998 --> 17:22.374
Eject!

17:24.585 --> 17:27.129
You're welcome. Now we're even, traitor.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.215
Reynolds, the Flex Fighters
aren't the bad guys here.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.383
Help me stop this.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.803
At this moment, we're on the same side.
You have a plan?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.389
Uh... these things are running up
on solar charge.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.640
Any way to shut that down?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.476
Drain the power of the sun?

17:40.559 --> 17:41.560
[grunts]

17:48.317 --> 17:50.736
What if we go the other way?
Create a solar flare?

17:50.819 --> 17:52.154
It might cause an energy surge,

17:52.237 --> 17:55.240
overload the circuits
and shut down these panels.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.203
Does that airship have a Flexarium Drive?

17:59.828 --> 18:01.789
-Of course it does.
-Blow it up.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.249
That should create the equivalent
of a solar flare.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.376
So your plan is to blow up our airship?

18:06.460 --> 18:09.254
If you don't do it,
this disc will blow an EMP

18:09.338 --> 18:13.258
that shuts down the entire city
and crash your airship anyway.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.720
Sir, I might have a way to stop all this.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.433
Are you insane? Do you know
what kinda damage that could cause?

18:21.517 --> 18:22.601
[Rook]<i> No, he's right.</i>

18:22.684 --> 18:26.021
<i>That's the only way to shut those</i>
<i>things down. Make it happen, Kane.</i>

18:26.980 --> 18:28.107
Yes, sir.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.199
[beeping]

18:38.909 --> 18:40.786
[regular beeping]

18:45.082 --> 18:46.250
[grunts]

18:46.333 --> 18:48.919
[electricity crackles]

18:49.002 --> 18:50.504
Uh... ah!

18:50.587 --> 18:52.256
Tech Men, abort!

19:02.558 --> 19:06.145
Before I take you in, I wanna know why
you helped stop those men.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.730
Uh, it was the right thing to do.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.401
[Kane]<i> Can anyone report</i>
<i>signs of Stretch in this mess?</i>

19:19.241 --> 19:22.119
No. He must have slipped away again.

19:31.378 --> 19:35.674
A flower blooms even when
no one is looking.

19:35.757 --> 19:37.342
[applause, cheers]

19:40.262 --> 19:44.933
-Yay, so cute.
-That's my granddaughter!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.810
[chuckles] All right, Izzy!

19:48.103 --> 19:49.188
[phone beeps]

19:49.271 --> 19:50.772
Five missed calls?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.859
Jake, I knew something would happen.
What's going on? We're heading to you.

19:53.942 --> 19:58.030
<i>No need. Things got a little dicey</i>
<i>for a second, but I took care of it.</i>

19:58.780 --> 20:00.365
<i>So, how was the play?</i>

20:13.670 --> 20:15.589
No sign of the Tech Men, sir.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.677
They got into my systems
and took complete control.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.430
I need to know how.
I need answers.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.307
We're looking into it, sir.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.401
[birds cry]

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
[Ricardo] Oh! Best flower ever,
Dizzy Izzy.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.378
And you got to see it with your own
eyeballs. Thanks for coming.

20:54.461 --> 20:58.340
It's good having you,
and your eyeballs around here again.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.716
Huh?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.718
Missed call from my dad.

21:01.802 --> 21:05.305
And it's good to be here.
You better get used to...

21:06.473 --> 21:08.100
[sighs]
[phone beeps]

21:11.937 --> 21:14.189
-What's wrong?
-I've gotta go.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.150
You're leaving all this food?

21:17.234 --> 21:19.945
No. I've gotta go-go.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.865
My parents just started a new business,
and they're moving us cross-country.
