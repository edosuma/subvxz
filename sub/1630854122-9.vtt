For the last three weeks,

40:48.968 --> 40:51.057
I have been running
around Europe doing busy work,

40:51.144 --> 40:54.582
analyst work,
while the team that I run

40:54.669 --> 40:57.759
has been busting their asses,

40:57.846 --> 41:00.066
putting their lives
in harm's way,

41:00.153 --> 41:02.851
and you got me
in a basement in Warsaw

41:02.938 --> 41:06.725
with my hands tied
behind my back.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.814

to observe the fly team,

41:08.901 --> 41:12.470
the team you run
as you just reminded me.

41:12.557 --> 41:16.778
They are sloppy, undisciplined,
and take unnecessary risks.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.563
They barely kept me apprised
of their mission.

41:18.650 --> 41:19.781
In fact, I would say they
deliberately went out

41:19.868 --> 41:21.217
of their way to
keep me in the dark

41:21.304 --> 41:22.567
about what went on in Antwerp.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.482
I had to get the details
through Europol.

41:24.569 --> 41:28.486
Two people died there due to
your special agents' actions.

I spoke to the deputy
