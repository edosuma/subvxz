Don't dismiss a compliment
when it's true.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.110
It has passion and art.

08:57.262 --> 08:59.871
And you're thinking
outside the box,

09:00.023 --> 09:01.447
which is surprising coming from

09:01.542 --> 09:03.283

-Well, Paige,

25:11.159 --> 25:12.901
we need to get
these divorce papers signed,

25:12.920 --> 25:13.994
and you were the one
who wanted to end the marriage.

25:14.088 --> 25:15.904
So why don't you grab
a pen there

25:15.906 --> 25:17.089

25:17.241 --> 25:19.258
<i> I'm just not sure</i>

25:19.410 --> 25:20.667
Come on. I know you're pregnant
with another man's baby.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.353
All right?
You gotta cut bait on Mike.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.170
-You're being selfish here.
<i> -PAIGE: I'm sorry.</i>

It's gonna be okay.

25:53.627 --> 25:55.110

You didn't fail, okay?

26:09.551 --> 26:11.460
You did what you needed to do.
You took care of yourself.

26:11.553 --> 26:14.405
You inspired Mike

26:14.556 --> 26:17.132
Look, I understand this.
I've been through it.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.467
Divorce is one of the hardest

harden you, Paige.

Okay.

You may be wondering

why Mike and Paula asked me
to officiate their wedding.

28:57.628 --> 29:00.462
Me too.
I didn't want to do this.

29:00.555 --> 29:03.815
I did not want to stand up here
in front of cameras

29:03.968 --> 29:05.558
and talk about love.

29:05.652 --> 29:07.803
But then I asked myself
the question that I'm usually

29:07.896 --> 29:09.304
asking everyone else,

29:09.397 --> 29:12.532
which is what prevents us?

29:13.477 --> 29:15.827
You can ask that question
about a lot of things.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.480
What prevents us from saying
the things we want to say,

29:18.499 --> 29:22.259
or from allowing ourselves
to love or be loved?

29:22.486 --> 29:24.244
And you'll always come up
with the same answer.

29:24.263 --> 29:28.748
The thing that
prevents us is fear.

29:28.768 --> 29:29.992
Putting yourself out there.

29:30.085 --> 29:32.770
Letting someone
really see you is scary.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.439
Trusting other people's
terrifying.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.499
Looking
at a terrible situation,

29:37.592 --> 29:39.518
holding hands,

29:39.670 --> 29:41.336
and facing it together,

29:41.429 --> 29:43.614
well, I guess that's love.

29:43.841 --> 29:49.269
So today we celebrate love
triumphing over fear.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.771
You know, Mike and Paula
met on this show.

29:51.865 --> 29:54.274
I have to give myself credit.
I saw their story right away.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.851
I put their headshots
right next to each other.

29:55.869 --> 29:57.035
And I said,

29:57.187 --> 30:00.522
"These two--these two
are gonna bang."

30:00.541 --> 30:03.025
(laughter)

30:03.193 --> 30:05.210
But it turned out to be
much more than that.

30:05.362 --> 30:07.453
It turned out to be
a love story

30:07.531 --> 30:10.307
that should give us all
hope and inspiration.

30:10.458 --> 30:14.536
So, Mike and Paula, thank you
for asking me to officiate.

30:14.629 --> 30:16.038
If there's anything you guys
want to say to each other

30:16.131 --> 30:16.980
before we get
to the deal points,

30:17.132 --> 30:18.540
now is probably the right time.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.225
-I do have a few things.
-Okay, great.

30:20.319 --> 30:25.138
Paula,
ours is a classic love story.

30:25.232 --> 30:27.140
Guy falls for girl.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.567
Guy loses girl.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.829
Guy goes on reality dance show
to win girl back

30:31.980 --> 30:33.905
but then meets
totally different girl

30:34.058 --> 30:36.224
who turns out
to be his soul mate

30:36.243 --> 30:39.670
and shows him
what true happiness is.

30:39.897 --> 30:43.732
Paula, you met me at my worst,
and you accepted me.

30:43.734 --> 30:47.660
You made me my best.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.013
I love you.

30:50.165 --> 30:53.333
Michael--that is
your real name, right?

30:53.427 --> 30:55.410
Yeah.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.763
Michael, we may not have
spent years together

30:58.858 --> 31:00.673
or even months.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.918
But from the moment I met you,

31:03.011 --> 31:06.012
I knew that I could share
parts of myself

31:06.031 --> 31:08.848
