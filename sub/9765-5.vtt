01:38.446 --> 01:41.021
New doei.

Spoons? The best that I can come is "spoons"?

01:55.377 --> 02:00.350
Josh. What is wrong? - They think I'm an idiot.

02:00.698 --> 02:03.462
Katy? - I.

02:04.948 --> 02:07.916

And.

02:11.205 --> 02:16.220

Every time even when I think of her breaking a sweat me out and I feel nauseated.

03:32.217 --> 03:34.569
'T sound like you're falling in love ..

03:34.654 --> 03:39.408

03:39.412 --> 03:42.263
Sorry. Look, son ..

03:42.374 --> 03:47.719
You may not believe this, but I used to be not always so smooth with the ladies.

Really? - Really. The first time he uitvroeg me ..

03:51.360 --> 03:56.415
I swear, he almost over. - That is not entirely true. After I uitvroeg ..

03:56.421 --> 04:00.939
I actually also vomited. - I thought it was because of the perennial shrimp.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.566
Hey, hey guys. I was just at the coffee: The Remarkable Brew. Look at you.

04:08.654 --> 04:13.005
They are looking for a band to play every Friday night. Do you realize it or how cool is this?

04:13.010 --> 04:15.152
For my band to play there. Every Friday.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.310
At the coffee shop.

04:18.798 --> 04:22.309
While you were there, you might not know what coffee drink?

04:22.315 --> 04:25.566
No. A little. 6 cups. Why do you ask?

04:26.300 --> 04:32.645
Maybe I have a present for her purchase. She said she loves spoons.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.663
What, again Katy? - Yes..

04:35.839 --> 04:40.675
we were just talking about his infatuation. - It's not love.

04:41.544 --> 04:43.528
It is love.

04:44.663 --> 04:49.976
Josh, if you want advice about approaching girls, ask not for old people.

04:51.307 --> 04:53.605
Not as an insult.

04:59.209 --> 05:03.817
Robert! Robert!

05:03.823 --> 05:06.457
Come, come, wherever you are.

05:09.582 --> 05:11.235
Megan? - What?

05:11.252 --> 05:14.514
What .. Why are you in our room? - Am I not.

05:16.101 --> 05:19.134
You're here too. - So, what's your point?

05:20.336 --> 05:25.531
Megan. - Okay. I found a cat and I'm kind of lost.

05:25.535 --> 05:29.200
You are allergic to cats. - Okay, I have no cat ..

05:29.205 --> 05:31.405
Beautiful. - I have a snake.

05:32.907 --> 05:35.228
Common!

05:39.836 --> 05:45.620
You lost a snake in our room? - Snake!

05:46.207 --> 05:48.480
I think I just found him.

05:48.787 --> 05:52.856
Robert, here I come. Do not swallow dad in.

05:56.352 --> 05:59.208
Who calls his snake now "Robert".

06:00.172 --> 06:03.827
What does it matter. We need to talk about Katy situation.

06:03.891 --> 06:07.772
It gives me a bad image if my stepbrother's a loser with girls.

06:08.517 --> 06:11.717
So how do we de-stagger me?

06:12.801 --> 06:15.801
Okay. Imagine that I'm Katy.

06:15.804 --> 06:18.280
You seem far not Katy.

06:18.802 --> 06:21.902
then use your imagination. - Oh, I got it.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.077
Keep this picture of Katy for your face.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.375
Did you draw this? - .. I have outlined.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.363
This is very good. - Thanks. It's not even my best ..

06:36.459 --> 06:40.163
I have a few dozen. Here are all my water color versions.

06:40.626 --> 06:44.810
Okay, which is narrow. Let's just try this, okay?

06:47.900 --> 06:52.027
Joshie Come here, give me a kiss. Come on baby, come here with that sugar lips.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.304
Forget it. This is hopeless. - Come on..

06:56.314 --> 06:58.468
You can talk to a girl that you like. - No ..

06:58.548 --> 07:01.379
you can talk to a girl that you like.

07:01.919 --> 07:04.847
How do you do it. - No idea.

07:05.011 --> 07:07.654
I guess I just talk about things I know. You know, I mean ..

07:07.669 --> 07:12.141
I play guitar and I think girls just find it really cool.

07:12.442 --> 07:16.643
You have to do something cool, right? - I'm not cool, okay?

07:16.666 --> 07:20.197
Why do you think so many old people like me?

07:21.676 --> 07:24.652
Well, you know what I'm gonna do?

07:24.884 --> 07:29.805
I'm going to give you the Drake Parker Crash Course on How to Approach Girls.

07:29.815 --> 07:32.684
I grab a pen and some paper sketch.

07:38.154 --> 07:40.659
So, how do you feel? - I feel really cool.

07:40.770 --> 07:43.579
Say it again. - I feel cool-el.

07:44.008 --> 07:48.251
Right. Do not say it that way. Well, let's practice one more time.

07:49.009 --> 07:52.081
This orange is Katy. - Can we not use apple?

07:52.161 --> 07:54.969
Oranges I get in my esophagus suffer from acid.

07:57.394 --> 08:02.394
Thus, the apple is Katy. now talks about her eyes.

08:02.658 --> 08:08.794
Hello Katy. Your eyes are like two crystal clear blue pools.

Excellent. What is your favourite sport? - Chess!

08:11.725 --> 08:14.014

Hey guys.

08:23.538 --> 08:27.202
What a guy. Can not stop the snake in a cage?

No. I need him to Mom again return to the pet. Your father is afraid.

08:31.925 --> 08:36.339

Compliment her hands. - Her hands. Your hands are beautiful.

08:47.699 --> 08:52.647
They would be able to break three boards. - No, she has no strong hands. They..

09:00.400 --> 09:02.420
There she is.

09:02.548 --> 09:06.206
Just waiting to fall in love with you. - Oh, I'm ready.

09:43.017 --> 09:47.894
My eyes are brown. - Oh, uh, I know. I know that.

09:47.902 --> 09:52.253
They are like two crystal clear pools .. With mud.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.541
Thank you.

09:58.107 --> 10:01.889
I see you have a flute. - Oh yeah. It's a recorder.

10:03.252 --> 10:09.410
I had something to play for Music Appreciation so yeah .. A tuba does not fit in my backpack.

10:17.207 --> 10:21.179

Do you play anything? - Chess.

10:50.381 --> 10:53.173
What size are you wearing socks?

10:53.700 --> 10:55.941
You do not need to buy a gift for me.

10:56.518 --> 11:00.389
But you have to bring your guitar and play a song for me.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.647
Bye.

11:04.964 --> 11:10.220
Would not you want something less musically? Slightly more sock-like?

11:10.266 --> 11:14.093
Or a spoon. You love spoons!

11:19.217 --> 11:25.733
The next audition is Drake. Where is Drake ?! - Oh, hey, hey! I am..

11:26.154 --> 11:29.906

11:30.186 --> 11:34.738
No no. You are the man who taught my brother karate. Do you remember? Josh?

11:34.756 --> 11:38.347
Yes! He was very, very bad.

11:39.008 --> 11:43.660
Okay. Anyway, my band is here to audition. - Hi.

11:43.846 --> 11:45.508
When will we ..

Less talk, more so.

11:52.209 --> 11:55.195
Okay. You know what to do.

11:55.212 --> 11:57.296
I play drums!

11:58.165 --> 12:00.446
You do. - Yeah.

12:00.476 --> 12:01.955
Okay, here we go.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.330
Oh my pick. - Backpack.

12:04.343 --> 12:05.791
Oh, sure.

12:17.907 --> 12:21.617
Okay, this is a song I wrote. It's called "I Found A Way".

12:21.620 --> 12:24.011
1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4.

12:27.191 --> 12:34.509
Well I never thought that it'd be so simple but,
I found a way. I found a way.

12:34.597 --> 12:42.038
And I always thought that it'd be too crazy but,
I found a way. I found a way.

12:42.814 --> 12:49.974
If you open up your mind.
See what's inside.

12:50.398 --> 12:57.126
It's gonna take some time to realize.

12:57.645 --> 13:00.320
Over your shoulder you..

13:00.326 --> 13:02.382
Slang!

13:09.936 --> 13:13.247
What was that!? Are you guys crazy?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.454
I-I'm sorry! I-I do not know .. - Out!

13:15.488 --> 13:20.559
You all! Never come back here, to the place for music and coffee.

13:20.604 --> 13:22.128
Get out!

13:40.642 --> 13:42.971
This is impossible.

13:47.005 --> 13:50.768
What are you doing home so soon? Have you had a chance to audition?

13:51.104 --> 13:54.449
Oh, we auditioned. It was a train wreck.

13:55.192 --> 13:57.404
What do you mean? You are super.

13:57.412 --> 14:02.788
Not when crawling a snake of a meter over my shoulder in the middle of the song.

14:03.002 --> 14:04.666
Megan.

14:05.746 --> 14:08.646
Me and my band are no longer welcome in The Remarkable Brew.

14:08.711 --> 14:11.337
Your band has been banned?

14:11.401 --> 14:16.578
For life. Oh, and you will not believe it. The man who taught karate you own the coffee shop.

14:16.754 --> 14:19.338
Drake. I'm in trouble.

14:19.408 --> 14:23.938
I told Katy that I play guitar. - Why lie to her?

14:24.089 --> 14:29.849
I do not know. I blurted it out like a kind of ugly pimple.

14:30.601 --> 14:33.203
Thanks for the dirty thoughts.

14:33.219 --> 14:35.171
Help me simply. - Okay. Be a calm.

14:35.266 --> 14:37.683
She does not know that you lied to her.

14:37.779 --> 14:44.252
She expects me to play a song for her on her birthday Saturday.

14:44.379 --> 14:47.594
No problem. - Well problem.

14:47.654 --> 14:52.642
Josh. Do not know how many songs are made up of three simple chords?

14:52.875 --> 14:55.091
I can learn three chords for Saturday.

14:55.105 --> 14:59.907
Can you? - Of course, I can even a monkey to learn to Saturday.

15:03.731 --> 15:07.155
Unbelievable. You broke every string!

15:07.160 --> 15:09.220
We better call a monkey.

15:10.256 --> 15:15.783
There are people with no arms who can play guitar. With their feet!

15:16.658 --> 15:23.131
This is my fault by lying. I'm just going to tell the truth and let her my whole life hating me.

15:23.153 --> 15:27.115
You can not tell her the truth. - I can not live with a lie.

15:28.595 --> 15:34.075
Look. You want honesty, if you want a girlfriend? - Girlfriend, please.

15:34.835 --> 15:38.305
Okay, I think I have a plan. Where is Katy's party?

15:38.319 --> 15:40.163
The Remarkable Brew.

15:40.182 --> 15:42.836
Right. This day gets better.

15:51.674 --> 15:53.655
The coast is clear.

15:54.240 --> 15:59.189
Okay, you go say hi to Katy. - Wait, how did you get backstage?

15:59.205 --> 16:01.500
There is a back door into the alley. Do not worry about me.

16:01.505 --> 16:04.742
Stick to the plan and Katy will his girlfriend before the evening is over.

16:04.752 --> 16:06.481
I'll stick to it.

16:09.895 --> 16:12.910
Hi Katy. - Oh, Josh! Hi.

16:13.158 --> 16:16.522
Come with me. Everyone, this is Josh.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.694
He will play a song for my birthday, right?

16:19.874 --> 16:22.853
You will hear a number. - Oh, and you know what ..

16:22.982 --> 16:26.982
That friend of my father, the owner, nogsteeds searching for a musician to play here every Friday.

16:27.054 --> 16:30.140
If he does not open auditions? - No, he has canceled after ..

16:30.153 --> 16:34.020
an idiot threw a live snake to the public.

16:36.081 --> 16:38.058
What a freak. - Yes.

16:38.186 --> 16:42.226
Would you on stage? - Sounds good.

16:42.840 --> 16:47.922
What song do you play? - This is a surprise for all of us.

16:55.026 --> 16:57.406
Hey, here. - I am nervous.

16:57.461 --> 16:59.584
Do not be afraid. Just put this jacket.

17:02.365 --> 17:06.025
You know, green is not so good for me.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.145
Come here.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.135
Headache! You give me a headache!

17:12.154 --> 17:13.943
Just put that jacket on.

17:14.603 --> 17:17.169
Everybody..

17:17.465 --> 17:23.329
Everyone .. Everyone, my friend Josh is a very talented musician and ..

17:23.401 --> 17:26.277
He will play a special song for me for my birthday.

17:26.305 --> 17:28.122
A big applause for Josh!

17:40.783 --> 17:42.172
Hi Josh.

17:42.584 --> 17:44.689
Whisk. - Oh okay.

17:49.077 --> 17:51.569
That's enough.

17:56.664 --> 18:02.241
II I always beat myself in the face to warm up before I start playing.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.378
Okay, I think I'm warmed up now.

18:08.001 --> 18:13.066
I will try to play a song Katy called ..

18:16.268 --> 18:20.332
I'm coming to try on the track name.

18:20.676 --> 18:23.157
Nogsteeds thinking. No idea.

18:25.602 --> 18:28.666
It has no name, I have just written.

18:29.098 --> 18:32.321
H It's called the Katy Lied.

18:40.690 --> 18:44.309
I'm going to start playing. Now.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.399
Thanks! Thanks everyone.

19:20.695 --> 19:22.487
Peace out!

19:22.907 --> 19:27.138
Josh, wait. You're amazing. I want you to meet the owner.

19:28.486 --> 19:30.755
I do not think that's necessary. I have to go.

19:30.764 --> 19:34.027
But it's my birthday, you can not leave now. Well, come on!

19:37.754 --> 19:39.699
They are assembled!

19:51.841 --> 19:55.219
You! I thought I had exiled you and your band!

19:55.315 --> 19:57.203
Katy, I can explain!

19:57.300 --> 19:59.284
I can explain!

20:00.543 --> 20:02.983
Ren! - Run.

20:03.588 --> 20:05.509
Can not you just leave?

20:15.024 --> 20:17.200
Man, there she is.

20:17.359 --> 20:19.846
Come on. You can not always hide from her.

20:20.014 --> 20:22.599
This must happen. - No no.

20:27.658 --> 20:29.314
Katy also.

20:31.008 --> 20:34.896
Hi Josh, if that is your real name.

20:35.064 --> 20:38.639
Because it is quite difficult to guess when you're telling the truth.

20:38.839 --> 20:42.367
Look, I wanted to apologize.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.403
Josh, it's all good ..

20:45.410 --> 20:49.850
but I'm not interested in being friends or with someone who thinks he should lie ..

20:49.858 --> 20:51.962
to impress me.

20:57.179 --> 21:00.397
"Josh". What is this?

21:02.780 --> 21:05.104
A surprise. - A birthday present.

21:05.149 --> 21:08.618
When did .. - Why do not leave you alone.

21:10.127 --> 21:13.599
It is astonishing. Where did you get this?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.304
Actually, I painted it.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.928
You painted this?

21:20.440 --> 21:25.616
Josh, if you can paint this why would you lie about the guitar?

21:26.103 --> 21:31.360
Because .. You're smart and clever .. and ..

21:32.196 --> 21:38.728
If you had any idea how terrifying it is to a girl like you to talk ..

21:39.480 --> 21:43.996
then you would understand why I say things wrong all the time.

21:45.834 --> 21:49.053
You just said the right thing.

21:49.898 --> 21:53.768
Wait a minute .. How do I know you really have painted?

21:53.888 --> 21:56.455
I have a whole notebook full.

21:56.890 --> 22:00.343
Maybe I can show you once you.

22:00.404 --> 22:03.339
Next Saturday would be cool?

22:03.620 --> 22:05.571
Sure!

22:05.580 --> 22:06.853
Cool.

22:07.317 --> 22:10.629
Hey Katy .. You know ..

22:10.901 --> 22:16.885
Drake is the one who has played the song that you liked so much and he's a great musician ..

22:17.628 --> 22:21.940
You think maybe you can talk to that friend of your father give him a chance to play ..

22:21.942 --> 22:23.786
in The Remarkable Brew?

22:24.808 --> 22:27.446
I think I Drake could set a new opportunity.

22:28.182 --> 22:34.960
I almost forgot. You forgot your coat at the coffee shop.

22:34.967 --> 22:37.832
You must be lost when you ran away screaming.

22:38.202 --> 22:39.926
Thanks.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.518
See you in class? - You'll sure.

22:50.503 --> 22:57.151
Well that was smoothly. - How did you like my painting got in her locker?

22:57.822 --> 23:00.015
Megan's slotkraak kit.

23:02.093 --> 23:06.317
You're the best, you know? - Yes. I know that.

23:06.627 --> 23:08.435
Oh and guess what? - What?

23:08.455 --> 23:11.530
Katy said she was with that friend of hers father will talk about a new opportunity to play ..

23:11.538 --> 23:12.994
in The Remarkable Brew.

23:13.003 --> 23:14.721
Serious? - Yes.

23:14.755 --> 23:18.810
Okay, it's official. I'm not the best. That's you.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.788
I try.

23:28.218 --> 23:29.858
What is wrong?

23:34.382 --> 23:37.490
Slang!

23:49.822 --> 23:53.463
Hi Josh. I'm Katy.

23:53.871 --> 23:58.215
Your brother Drake, is a lot.

23:59.385 --> 24:01.569
I thought this was about me.

24:01.665 --> 24:06.913
Sorry. Come Joshie. Give me a kiss. Come on baby, come here with that sugar lips.

24:10.788 --> 24:13.364
Thanks! Thanks everyone.
