00:01.418 --> 00:03.067
<i>Look who's down here again.
Previously on "greenleaf"...</i>

00:03.069 --> 00:04.218
Rough morning with your mama?

00:04.220 --> 00:05.903
Yeah. Anything I can do?

00:05.905 --> 00:07.822
No. She's off her meds.

00:07.824 --> 00:09.774
And that church
is going up like bamboo.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.092
Unless it's not.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.244
My son, aaron, has been doing
a lot of zoning law.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.345
Over in nashville.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.647
I could work remotely.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.665
If it would help for me
to stay a while.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.816
Jacob's room is sitting empty.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.852
I really don't know
how all this is gonna end.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.170
How what's gonna end?

00:22.172 --> 00:24.339
Triumph two and all the money.

00:24.341 --> 00:25.923
That basie's putting into this.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.425
What about the law?
Or even god's law?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.494
I'm giving all this
back to the church,

00:29.496 --> 00:31.029
So I'm at a loss
to see what's wrong.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.697
It should happen naturally,

00:32.698 --> 00:34.515
And it doesn't
feel that way anymore.

00:34.517 --> 00:35.466
It's over.

00:35.468 --> 00:36.701
Once the smoke clears,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.436
And all this legal stuff
is behind you,

00:38.438 --> 00:40.238
If you ever need
someone to talk to...

00:40.240 --> 00:41.606
This is my birthday.

00:41.608 --> 00:42.807
You're busy every other day
with him,

00:42.809 --> 00:44.742
Can't you just stick with me
for this one night?

00:44.744 --> 00:45.877
Excuse me. Can I help you?

00:45.879 --> 00:48.279
My name is grace greenleaf Lorraine.
I just want to make sure.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.414
That you know.
Lorraine, go home.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.415
He's a child molester. Stop it!

00:50.417 --> 00:51.549
Is he pressing charges or not?

00:51.551 --> 00:52.700
If you continue to harass him,

00:52.702 --> 00:54.035
I have a feeling he will.

00:54.037 --> 00:56.587
What is it gonna take, gigi,
to bring you back into the fold?

00:56.589 --> 00:58.122
Put mac in jail.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:30.023 --> 01:31.589
What did you do to her?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.141
<i>What did you do?</i>

01:40.567 --> 01:42.233
Aah!

01:55.982 --> 01:57.532
Good morning, dear.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.050
Morning, mama. Daddy.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.384
Gigi.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.453
All this preparation
for your sister's memorial.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.906
Has your mama in a...
A fragile state.

02:08.845 --> 02:10.445
How can I help?

02:10.447 --> 02:12.196
The scholarship fund.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.466
What about it?

02:15.468 --> 02:17.585
Were there
any other programs like that?

02:17.587 --> 02:19.220
Awards or something else...
Gigi.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.072
That mac might have used
to pay his victims off?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.641
We told the police
everything we knew, gigi...

02:23.643 --> 02:25.977
Gave them everything.
I have to find someone.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.178
Who will come forward and talk.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.996
Before this
deferred adjudication ends.

02:28.998 --> 02:31.883
If it ends with no new evidence
or testimony,

02:31.885 --> 02:33.935
Then he'll just be free.

02:35.955 --> 02:37.789
That can't seem right to you.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.191
Your uncle used
his worldly power.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.027
To evade the worldly law.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.062
Now you can console yourself
if you must.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.514
With the prospect
that he'll suffer in hell.

02:46.516 --> 02:47.915
Because of what he did
to your sister,

02:47.917 --> 02:50.885
Or you can pray every day,
as I do,

02:50.887 --> 02:54.155
That he'll be convicted
of his sin and repent.

02:54.157 --> 02:56.457
You still haven't answered
my question, mama.

02:56.459 --> 02:57.992
Were there any other programs,
any awards?

02:57.994 --> 02:59.927
Please. Please, help me!

02:59.929 --> 03:02.430
How sharper
than a serpent's tooth it is.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.182
To have a thankless child.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.152
I'll wait for you in the car.

03:12.909 --> 03:17.028
Do me a favor, gigi...
For yourself, sophia, faith,

03:17.030 --> 03:21.248
Whoever it is that can
arouse pity in your heart...

03:21.250 --> 03:24.385
Until your sister's memorial
is over tomorrow,

03:24.387 --> 03:25.503
Be still.

04:29.485 --> 04:31.919
If you're compelled to say
anything on that girl's behalf,

04:31.921 --> 04:33.521
I encourage you to reconsider.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.341
Hello?

04:37.343 --> 04:38.343
Hello. Mae?

04:39.262 --> 04:41.312
Mac?

04:41.314 --> 04:42.730
I didn't expect you to answer.

04:43.716 --> 04:44.832
I wish I hadn't.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.250
What does
that son of a bitch want?

04:46.252 --> 04:47.585
Why are you calling?

04:47.587 --> 04:49.854
I just wanted to reach out.

04:49.856 --> 04:52.189
I know tomorrow is
the anniversary...

04:52.191 --> 04:53.291
Don't you say it.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.277
Don't you let
my child's name pass your lips.

04:58.948 --> 05:01.165
You really think
you didn't do it.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.433
<i>I didn't.</i>

05:02.435 --> 05:04.385
If I did, you think
I'd risk calling just to s...

05:05.989 --> 05:07.822
What did he want?

05:10.026 --> 05:11.075
Nothing.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.450
So, how did that
work out for you?

05:21.204 --> 05:23.054
Well, she's gonna go
to her grave.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.923
Believing all gigi's lies.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.959
I told you you were asking
for trouble calling.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.064
Thank god you found me
when you did.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.066
We'll get you right
before it's all over.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.267
Call me
after your meeting today.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.369
I want to be the first
to hear the good news.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.854
I will.

05:39.856 --> 05:41.505
Thank you.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.674
You're a good man, robert.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.693
Don't believe
what that old biddy says.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.285
Getting better all the time.

05:58.574 --> 06:00.274
Why would a judge do it, though?

06:00.276 --> 06:01.809
Most wouldn't.

06:01.811 --> 06:03.678
But this judge has been known.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.496
To view cases
such as your uncle's.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.181
With a jaundiced eye.

06:07.183 --> 06:10.201
A sexist, patriarchal eye.
This is memphis.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.470
Most folks here
just call it 20/20 vision.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.624
When is he gonna rule?
Could be as early as next week.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.112
So, that's why you came
all the way over here,

06:21.114 --> 06:22.780
To tell me this in person...

06:22.782 --> 06:24.515
And on the eve
of the anniversary.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.101
Of my sister's suicide...
That mac just wins?

06:27.103 --> 06:28.103
No.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.991
I'm sorry. This is just...

06:33.993 --> 06:36.594
This is bad news to get
on a day like this.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.929
No need to be.

06:38.931 --> 06:42.967
I actually came to say
you may have one last shot.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.168
I'll take it.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.971
It seems there was a girl...

06:46.973 --> 06:48.039
Who lived in the building.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.391
That your uncle
used to live in...

06:50.393 --> 06:52.376
16 years old.

06:52.378 --> 06:56.080
Neighbors said
they were friendly.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.049
The detectives made a note
about it in the file,

06:58.051 --> 06:59.500
But no one ever followed it up.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.318
So, what are you gonna do? Me?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.604
Nothing.

07:03.606 --> 07:05.940
The case is closed.

07:05.942 --> 07:08.125
And I've been advised
by some friends of your uncle.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.827
To keep it that way.

07:19.155 --> 07:21.539
It might be nothing.

07:26.763 --> 07:28.679
It's more than I got.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.464
I'll check it out.

07:30.466 --> 07:32.149
Let me know what happens.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.534
I will.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.726
Unless there's
a swift infusion of cash.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.595
From somewhere soon, pastor...

07:44.597 --> 07:45.946
Something's gonna give. Exactly.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.615
<i>We can't have that. We won't.</i>

07:47.617 --> 07:48.766
If we just let the crews go...

07:48.768 --> 07:50.151
We not gonna do that.

07:50.153 --> 07:51.635
We got a week left
on this thing.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.821
We're just gonna have
to scrounge up some scratch.

07:53.823 --> 07:55.723
The way the saints do.
How's that?

07:55.725 --> 07:58.159
How do you think? Praying.

07:58.161 --> 07:59.376
Yeah.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.312
I know how hard you both work.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.980
I'm sorry to have
to deliver this bad news.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.115
Don't be, brittany.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.734
As I always say,
the facts are friendly.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.954
Pastor greenleaf. Brittany.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.717
Can you believe that girl?
What about her?

08:25.054 --> 08:26.971
We're gonna have to round up
some cash, brother... fast.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.839
Pains me to see her
suffering like that.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.175
Basie... Well, talk to me.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.275
You ready to plunge.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.278
Clara jackson's
solid-gold money toilet?

08:34.280 --> 08:37.313
No, but maybe...

08:37.316 --> 08:39.533
What? Maybe we should just stop.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.003
Stop what? Basie don't stop.

08:43.005 --> 08:44.288
Triumph two.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.240
You wanted to make a point
to my father. You made it.

08:46.242 --> 08:47.741
But I am not...
And I can just stay here.

08:47.743 --> 08:48.792
And work with you downtown.

08:48.794 --> 08:51.011
Let the crews go. Call it a day.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.530
Brother greenleaf,
how can I put this?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.865
Never... not ever. No.

08:55.951 --> 08:57.268
Now, what if moses
went back to god.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.170
After his first tussle
with the pharaoh and said,

08:59.172 --> 09:01.872
"I don't know, lord. I mean,
he's just so big and mean.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.008
Can't we just continue
to be slaves?"

09:04.010 --> 09:05.442
"please?"

09:05.444 --> 09:07.578
You know,
moses wasn't out for revenge.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.648
He was on a mission... for god.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.750
Who says it can't be both?

09:15.271 --> 09:16.854
I'm not gonna have
this conversation with you.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.139
I promised you a church, and that's
just what I'm gonna give you.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.058
I just need
a little bit of faith.

09:22.445 --> 09:24.077
Well, I'm ready
to pray whenever.

09:24.079 --> 09:25.729
Then do.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.164
Do.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.899
'Cause there's a game tonight.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.534
And I hear bass reeves
is in town,

09:30.536 --> 09:34.271
And you know bass reeves
don't play to lose.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.006
Bass wins.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.932
And you can sign here, please.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.237
All right.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.221
Done.

10:07.223 --> 10:09.590
So, you happy now?

10:15.364 --> 10:16.931
No.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.847
Hey. Hey, daddy.

10:33.849 --> 10:35.215
Now, this just landed
in the mail room,

10:35.217 --> 10:38.619
And looks like
it might be good news.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.487
It is. It's my cds.

10:40.489 --> 10:42.573
Can I have a look? Please.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.408
You and mama paid for them.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.293
Did we?

10:46.295 --> 10:48.411
Well, I don't remember all that.

10:48.413 --> 10:51.031
Now look at that.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.600
That's a lovely picture.

10:53.602 --> 10:54.968
I guess.

10:56.839 --> 10:59.039
What's the matter?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.808
The lake...

11:00.810 --> 11:04.278
I never thought when we were
picking out the cover...

11:04.280 --> 11:06.647
What... faith?

11:06.649 --> 11:08.449
Yeah.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.584
Should we change it?

11:10.586 --> 11:13.487
Lord knows this earth is
the site of many sorrows.

11:15.691 --> 11:19.960
I think
it's a fitting resurrection.

11:19.962 --> 11:21.028
May I keep this?

11:21.030 --> 11:23.564
Of course. Take two.

11:23.566 --> 11:24.765
I think I'll do that.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.369
Daddy?

11:29.371 --> 11:31.455
Yes, child.

11:35.077 --> 11:36.510
I'm divorced.

11:38.881 --> 11:40.247
Come.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.421
Why does everything I do
go wrong?

11:49.992 --> 11:52.226
Don't you know?

11:52.228 --> 11:53.844
No.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.947
The sparkle depends.

11:56.949 --> 11:59.133
On the flaws in a diamond.

12:01.119 --> 12:04.605
I look at you now,

12:04.607 --> 12:07.007
And you've never been brighter.

12:10.346 --> 12:12.713
Thank you.

12:27.112 --> 12:30.414
Good morning. Hi.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.518
Hey. Hi. Can I help you?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.270
Yes, please.
I'm looking for a girl.

12:36.272 --> 12:39.106
I believe she lives here...
Michaela reese?

12:39.108 --> 12:42.409
What's this about?
My name is grace greenleaf.

12:42.411 --> 12:45.028
I'm a pastor at calvary
fellowship world ministries.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.963
Does she live here?

12:46.965 --> 12:48.348
I'm sorry.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.118
We're not allowed to discuss
residents with strangers.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.623
Did you work here
when a man by the name.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.009
Of robert mccready lived here?

12:59.011 --> 13:00.510
So you did.

13:00.512 --> 13:02.629
So you know
the rest about him, too.

13:02.631 --> 13:03.931
I think you should go.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.849
Please.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.569
Just let me explain.

13:08.571 --> 13:10.604
The police made a note
about michaela,

13:10.606 --> 13:12.139
That she lived in this building,

13:12.141 --> 13:14.174
That she had
a relationship with mac,

13:14.176 --> 13:15.375
Maybe just a friendship,

13:15.377 --> 13:17.678
But no one ever asked her
about it.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.929
Management has a policy.

13:18.931 --> 13:22.282
He abused my sister,
and she killed herself.

13:22.284 --> 13:24.565
I'm just trying to make sure
that it doesn't happen again.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.522
Help.

13:28.524 --> 13:30.324
It's the right thing to do.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.785
I do know she spent time
in his apartment.

13:43.038 --> 13:45.205
I didn't think anything of it.

13:45.207 --> 13:47.658
She doesn't have
the best home life,

13:47.660 --> 13:50.994
And it just seemed like
he was being a good neighbor.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.115
I just want to talk to her.

13:59.388 --> 14:02.556
She gets home
from school at 4:00.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.829
Thank you.

14:13.068 --> 14:15.469
Deputy mayor leonard.
Walk with me.

14:15.471 --> 14:17.537
Thanks for meeting in person.

14:17.539 --> 14:20.741
Yeah, always a pleasure
to see you.

14:20.743 --> 14:22.759
Skip. What?

14:22.761 --> 14:25.295
I'll see this gets
into the right hands.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.564
I got to get back.
I want to ask you something.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.618
I've already stuck my neck out
enough for you with this judge.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.970
What now?

14:32.972 --> 14:34.871
I need a job.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.723
Great idea. Get one.

14:36.725 --> 14:40.093
Good advice.
Maybe I'll try the f.E.C.

14:40.095 --> 14:43.096
I reckon they might be hiring.

14:43.098 --> 14:45.732
Well, see, if they don't already
have an investigation open.

14:45.734 --> 14:48.151
Into how you and your boy
raised the finances.

14:48.153 --> 14:51.021
For his first campaign,
I imagine they will.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.923
After I talk to them.

14:56.111 --> 14:57.778
What kind of job
are we talking about?

14:57.780 --> 14:59.162
Nothing fancy... don't worry.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.048
Just a chance
to get paid doing good.

15:01.050 --> 15:03.700
For the good folks of memphis.

15:03.702 --> 15:07.154
That's the last of my savings.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.506
After I'm cleared, why not?

15:09.508 --> 15:11.425
I'll see what I can do.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.634
Okay.

15:20.636 --> 15:22.369
Yeah, no, no, no, no.
Makes sense.

15:22.371 --> 15:24.888
Thanks anyway.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.323
Bye.

15:26.325 --> 15:29.343
Hey. Got a second?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.310
For what?

15:30.312 --> 15:33.313
Kevin.

15:33.315 --> 15:34.981
We're still gonna have
to work together.

15:34.983 --> 15:36.366
Don't be that way.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.418
Sorry,
I'm living in a hotel again,

15:38.420 --> 15:39.553
And every time
I find a good place,

15:39.555 --> 15:41.638
It's rented by the time I call.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.823
I'm sorry.

15:42.825 --> 15:44.257
I don't know
if that's true anyway.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.760
Don't know if what's true?
Us "having" to work together.

15:46.762 --> 15:49.296
We're in the same building.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.766
After what you told
your parents, why would I stay?

15:52.768 --> 15:55.251
Are you planning on quitting?

15:55.253 --> 15:57.320
Not yet.

15:57.322 --> 15:58.972
What do you want?

16:00.725 --> 16:03.710
I wanted to know if you were
coming to faith's memorial.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.512
I hadn't planned on it.

16:05.514 --> 16:08.031
But not out of disrespect
to her or anything,

16:08.033 --> 16:09.966
Just...

16:09.968 --> 16:11.368
You know, all this.

16:11.370 --> 16:14.354
I, um, I was hoping you would.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.225
Well, I'd rather not.

16:19.628 --> 16:20.977
Okay.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.264
Charity.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.868
Just having a bad day.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.069
Sorry.

16:30.355 --> 16:31.721
I know.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.876
Would you at least want
to come hang with nathan.

16:35.878 --> 16:37.427
During the ceremony?

16:39.047 --> 16:40.814
Yeah.

16:40.816 --> 16:42.532
I can do that.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.401
Thanks.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.186
Thank you.

16:46.188 --> 16:48.772
Got to get back to the search.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.323
Okay.

16:50.325 --> 16:52.726
See you tomorrow.

17:20.222 --> 17:22.689
Excuse me, michaela? Yeah?

17:22.691 --> 17:23.656
My name is grace greenleaf.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.459
I'm a pastor
at calvary fellowship.

17:27.362 --> 17:30.030
Where mr. Mccready worked?
That's right.

17:30.032 --> 17:31.698
So you knew mr. Mccready?

17:32.701 --> 17:36.102
A little, yeah.

17:36.104 --> 17:38.588
W-why?

17:40.025 --> 17:41.942
Am I in trouble? No, not at all.

17:41.944 --> 17:44.444
I just want to talk to you,
ask you a few questions.

17:44.446 --> 17:46.713
Would that be okay?

17:46.715 --> 17:48.849
Yeah, okay.

17:48.851 --> 17:51.518
What do you want to know?

17:51.520 --> 17:52.619
Can we?

17:55.366 --> 17:56.565
Most of the time,
he just told me things.

17:56.567 --> 17:57.950
From books he was reading.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.385
He gave me money sometimes.

17:59.387 --> 18:01.737
When my mom would split
or freak.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.890
He was chill.

18:04.892 --> 18:07.159
So that's it? That's all?

18:07.161 --> 18:08.110
Yeah.

18:08.112 --> 18:10.713
He never...

18:10.715 --> 18:14.016
Tried anything...
Tried to touch you?

18:14.018 --> 18:15.418
Maybe more?

18:15.420 --> 18:18.220
Why are you asking me this?
I thought you weren't a cop.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.656
No, sweetheart, I am not.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.310
You do know he was arrested.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.945
Yeah. You know what for?

18:25.947 --> 18:28.114
Yeah, but he didn't
get convicted.

18:28.116 --> 18:29.632
Yes, he did.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.484
He just didn't do time.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.640
So, why are you asking me this?

18:39.811 --> 18:42.411
Because if he ever did do.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.648
Anything like that to you...

18:45.650 --> 18:48.350
We can put him in jail,
and he would stay there.

18:54.826 --> 18:57.476
But...

18:57.478 --> 18:59.044
He didn't.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.400
Would you tell me if he did?

19:04.402 --> 19:07.002
I don't know, 'cause I wouldn't
know what that was like.

19:07.004 --> 19:09.405
But he didn't.

19:12.393 --> 19:15.277
He was always really cool.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.314
Sorry.

19:20.418 --> 19:23.052
No, don't be.

19:23.054 --> 19:25.955
I am glad that he didn't do
anything to you.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.340
It's good.

19:30.277 --> 19:32.144
Can I go now?

19:32.146 --> 19:34.930
Yeah. Yeah.

19:34.932 --> 19:36.332
Thank you.

20:02.627 --> 20:04.593
Hello. Mr. Mccready.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.629
Yeah? It's michaela.

20:06.631 --> 20:08.247
Yeah, I know. Everything okay?

20:08.249 --> 20:09.598
I don't know.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.336
A lady came by the building today
asking questions about you.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.871
What kind of questions?

20:18.192 --> 20:19.909
You don't have to tell me.
I know.

20:19.911 --> 20:21.827
Yeah.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.479
And so what did you tell her?

20:23.481 --> 20:26.515
Just that you've always
been nice and nothing else,

20:26.517 --> 20:27.816
And that was that.

20:27.818 --> 20:29.602
Should I not have talked to her?

20:29.604 --> 20:31.704
No, no.

20:31.706 --> 20:33.489
It's all right.

20:33.491 --> 20:35.191
You did good.
I appreciate you telling me.

20:35.193 --> 20:38.627
That means, means a lot.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.396
So, um,

20:40.398 --> 20:43.966
You know there's nothing
to these stories, I hope.

20:43.968 --> 20:45.234
I do.

20:45.236 --> 20:47.119
Yeah. Good.

20:49.173 --> 20:50.606
How's your mom doing?

20:50.608 --> 20:52.341
Okay.

20:52.343 --> 20:55.244
She's on new meds now,

20:55.246 --> 20:56.962
So that's always a nightmare.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.063
Well...

20:58.065 --> 20:59.064
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.182
I should...

21:00.184 --> 21:02.501
She actually popped off
on me bad yesterday.

21:02.503 --> 21:03.886
Because I got home late...

21:03.888 --> 21:06.071
Like, really bad.

21:06.073 --> 21:07.690
Robert?

21:07.692 --> 21:09.959
Robert, you won't believe
what I...

21:14.232 --> 21:15.731
I can't wait to graduate and go.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.434
Well, well, that is, a problem.

21:18.436 --> 21:21.453
Yeah. It is.

21:21.455 --> 21:24.540
I should probably get back
to you tomorrow on that, okay?

21:27.728 --> 21:28.861
Yeah, okay.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.796
All right. Talk to you then.

21:31.782 --> 21:33.449
Who was that?

21:33.451 --> 21:34.850
My lawyer.

21:34.852 --> 21:37.486
Everything all right?
It will be.

21:37.488 --> 21:40.889
Just these last-minute hoops
they want me to jump through.

21:40.891 --> 21:43.692
It'll all be fine.

21:43.694 --> 21:45.094
You eaten yet?

21:45.096 --> 21:46.779
No, I didn't get a chance.

21:46.781 --> 21:49.131
Well, let's go to paulette's.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.432
I won't say no to that.

21:52.637 --> 21:54.770
Thank you.
Just let me get dressed, okay?

21:54.772 --> 21:56.488
Yes.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.691
So I'm gonna need you
to just be zen tonight.

22:15.693 --> 22:18.060
Got it? Trust in the spirit.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.595
You planning something crazy?

22:19.597 --> 22:21.930
No, just making sense of the
crazy coming my way. Feel me?

22:23.334 --> 22:26.168
Brother leonard. Pastor skanks.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.736
You ready to lose some money?

22:27.738 --> 22:30.272
Never short on confidence,
this guy, is he?

22:30.274 --> 22:32.608
No, that is definitely his gift.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.343
Never tall on size.

22:34.345 --> 22:36.278
I heard that.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.247
Hey, pastor greenleaf. Yeah?

22:38.249 --> 22:40.783
You all go on ahead. Okay.

22:40.785 --> 22:43.886
What's up, fellas?

22:43.888 --> 22:45.654
Looks like you caught the bug.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.523
Well, I caught something.

22:47.525 --> 22:49.458
What it is exactly,
I'm not sure.

22:49.460 --> 22:50.859
We'll see.

22:50.861 --> 22:53.028
What's good?

22:53.030 --> 22:57.066
I saw your uncle earlier today.

22:57.068 --> 22:58.067
Okay.

22:58.069 --> 22:59.435
Seems to be working real hard.

22:59.437 --> 23:01.103
To put his life back in order.

23:01.105 --> 23:04.406
This legal cloud looming
over his head is about to pass,

23:04.408 --> 23:06.408
So he came and asked me
for a job.

23:06.410 --> 23:09.211
Now, I'll see if I can't put
something together for him.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.481
Don't do that.
Well, it won't be anything big,

23:12.483 --> 23:15.617
Just a way
to pay the bills, you know?

23:15.619 --> 23:18.654
Like I said, just, no.

23:18.656 --> 23:20.039
Don't.

23:21.492 --> 23:23.459
But it's
the christian thing to do.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.262
What did I tell you, man?

23:27.264 --> 23:28.931
Don't! Whoa.

23:28.933 --> 23:30.482
Whoa, easy.

23:30.484 --> 23:31.834
Easy.

23:35.306 --> 23:37.172
Man, I got
to drive home tomorrow.

23:37.174 --> 23:38.540
And drive right past the lake.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.008
Where my little sister
drowned herself.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.511
Because of what
that man did to her.

23:42.513 --> 23:43.729
You give him a job,

23:43.731 --> 23:47.282
You so much as piss on him
if he's on fire,

23:47.284 --> 23:50.786
I'll take your ass apart
six ways to sunday.

23:50.788 --> 23:53.155
Understand?

23:53.157 --> 23:55.290
Yeah, I understand.

23:58.095 --> 23:59.461
Geez.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.307
Well, you just
never really know, do you?

24:12.309 --> 24:14.025
What's that, dear?

24:14.027 --> 24:15.344
When you're happy.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.181
And when you
really have it, you know?

24:19.183 --> 24:22.300
I mean, and you stop
to take a picture,

24:22.302 --> 24:24.319
And then you're more intent
on taking the picture.

24:24.321 --> 24:25.888
Than you are knowing
that you have it.

24:26.957 --> 24:30.692
Finally, for one moment,
you have it.

24:30.694 --> 24:32.377
We did have it,

24:32.379 --> 24:34.046
Which is more
than most folk can say.

24:34.048 --> 24:37.816
Well... we'll have it again.

24:37.818 --> 24:39.001
A form of it, anyway.

24:39.003 --> 24:41.303
I'll be ready for heaven
when my time comes.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.288
Guess that's some consolation.

24:45.910 --> 24:48.360
Hey. Evening.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.395
H-hey, grace,
c-come in and sit down.

24:50.397 --> 24:52.815
Your mother and I are just
looking at some old pictures.

24:52.817 --> 24:55.050
I'm good. Thanks, though.
Excuse me?

24:57.755 --> 25:00.155
I'm sorry. I just...
I'd really rather not.

25:00.157 --> 25:03.325
You can't bear it?

25:03.327 --> 25:05.744
Well, your father and I are
just here mourning your sister.

25:05.746 --> 25:10.165
And, all the beauty
she took when she passed.

25:12.269 --> 25:15.604
Grace greenleaf,
stay right there!

25:15.606 --> 25:17.473
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.258
Don't you dare do that.

25:19.260 --> 25:22.544
Mama, please, I just...
I feel so powerless.

25:22.546 --> 25:23.779
Would you just let me go?

25:23.781 --> 25:25.230
"Powerless"? Hey!

25:25.232 --> 25:26.982
Yes! What do you know.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.600
From powerless?

25:28.602 --> 25:30.469
When have you
ever been prevented.

25:30.471 --> 25:33.121
From anything until now...

25:33.123 --> 25:36.692
Or restrained yourself one whit?

25:36.694 --> 25:39.127
Every problem you have,
you caused.

25:39.129 --> 25:41.029
Every cross you bear,

25:41.031 --> 25:42.764
You built it yourself.

25:42.766 --> 25:44.399
You don't know
about powerless...

25:44.401 --> 25:46.835
What your sister endured,
what I endured,

25:46.837 --> 25:50.072
What those girls you go around
showing off defending endured.

25:50.074 --> 25:52.457
Mama. What?

25:52.459 --> 25:54.543
What have you ever endured?

26:06.207 --> 26:08.724
Well, nothing
compared to you I guess.

26:11.495 --> 26:13.829
God.

26:13.831 --> 26:16.648
Go on.

26:16.650 --> 26:19.151
Go up to your
little hidey-hole and stew.

26:19.153 --> 26:20.586
That's what you do.

26:20.588 --> 26:22.604
Mama, I'm sorry.
I'll look at pictures, okay?

26:22.606 --> 26:25.457
No, please. Just go.

26:26.844 --> 26:29.311
There will be enough
to fight about tomorrow.

26:29.313 --> 26:30.729
I'm empty.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.652
I didn't know they still made
easy money like this.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.654
Whoo! I should have
brought along a suitcase.

27:05.341 --> 27:07.091
Doesn't it say
somewhere in the bible,

27:07.093 --> 27:08.826
"shut your gloating mouth"?

27:08.828 --> 27:11.996
James 4 and 16...
"all boasting is evil,".

27:11.998 --> 27:13.430
But there ain't
no boasting going on here.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.133
It's just thankful heart
making holy exaltations.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.637
About the saving power of god.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.088
And maybe a little boasting.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.259
Just deal the cards, please.

27:27.129 --> 27:28.512
Cut those, please.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.165
Ante up, gentlemen.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.389
Yep, they call it "escargot,".

27:38.391 --> 27:40.191
But at the end of the day,
it's still a snail.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.893
I've never been to france,

27:42.895 --> 27:45.095
But I can't imagine
the food being.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.780
Any better than that place.

27:46.782 --> 27:49.383
She does such an amazing job
on everything.

27:49.385 --> 27:51.585
Well, I'm... I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.271
Have you ever been to france?
Yeah, a few times.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.906
Well, you have to take me.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.859
Done.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.571
Who is this?

28:27.573 --> 28:29.123
What are you talking about?

28:29.125 --> 28:32.242
This here... who is it?

28:32.244 --> 28:35.212
You don't need
to touch it to read it.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.881
You're not blind, mac.
Who is it?

28:37.883 --> 28:39.883
It's my niece.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.653
Your niece?
Yeah, grace's kid, sophia.

28:44.256 --> 28:47.240
You and she talk, text?
Yeah, sometimes.

28:47.242 --> 28:48.459
She knows
her mother is not right,

28:48.461 --> 28:50.094
And with faith's thing
coming up tomorrow,

28:50.096 --> 28:52.129
Grace is...

28:52.131 --> 28:54.565
It's sophia.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.300
Call her. Go on.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.369
No, no.

28:58.371 --> 28:59.853
I just wanted to know.

29:01.424 --> 29:03.173
Can I have it back now?

29:08.280 --> 29:10.414
Did anyone ever tell you
how beautiful you are.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.716
When you're jealous? No.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.635
Well, let me be the first.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.431
$10,000.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.233
Who wants to dance?

29:32.154 --> 29:33.570
Can't follow you boys
down this road,

29:33.572 --> 29:35.372
And I can't say I'm sorry.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.775
Too rich for my blood.

29:46.402 --> 29:47.785
Mr. Leonard.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.110
I'm good.
Well, I-i shouldn't say that.

29:56.112 --> 29:59.029
Let's say I'm blessed.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.265
You ain't saying nothing,
mr. Preacher man.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.484
How about 100 large
on top of that?

30:04.186 --> 30:06.587
That puts you all in.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.175
I ain't scared.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.146
Let's see...

30:16.148 --> 30:19.850
A 9 plus a 10 plus a jack.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.152
Plus a queen plus a king.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.054
Whatcha call that?

30:25.908 --> 30:28.075
A losing hand.

30:31.564 --> 30:33.780
Where's your Jesus now,
brothers?

30:33.782 --> 30:35.065
Where is he?

30:35.067 --> 30:36.567
He must be
up on the mountain praying.

30:36.569 --> 30:39.570
I took it all!

30:39.572 --> 30:41.605
Goodness. I got the whole pot.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.023
I'm getting some money.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.317
You gonna be all right?

30:53.319 --> 30:56.353
Yeah. That's the game, right?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.288
The lord must have something
he trying to teach me,

30:58.290 --> 31:01.191
Using them fools
to spank me like that.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.577
Well, I'm ready to learn.

31:03.579 --> 31:05.496
See you tomorrow. Basie.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.097
Yeah, I know.
I'll give it back to you.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.966
No, no, no, it's not that.
I lost mine fair and square.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.267
That's on me.
Well, I'm gonna cover it.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.702
All the same.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.437
It's just gonna take me a few
games to do it. That's all.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.439
Basie. Yeah?

31:15.441 --> 31:16.507
Well, come on now,
tasha gonna be wondering.

31:16.509 --> 31:18.175
Where her man's got to so late.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.662
Is that the church's money
you lost in there tonight?

31:25.117 --> 31:26.500
Most definitely.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.954
Most definitely.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.995
It's okay.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.530
It's all right.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.768
Here you go.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.803
Hi.

32:19.805 --> 32:22.105
Hi.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.674
Hi.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.014
There you go.

32:43.145 --> 32:44.995
Mommy loves you.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.032
I miss you, faith.

33:57.185 --> 33:59.002
And I love you.

34:07.629 --> 34:11.547
Zora, go get your brother ready.
We're gonna be leaving in five.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.915
I'm almost done.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.701
Zora, if you don't get up
off that couch right now,

34:14.703 --> 34:15.985
I promise you...

34:15.987 --> 34:18.438
You try maintaining
a lifelike presence online.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.456
I have a brand
to support here, people.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.976
Go get him dressed.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.594
I'm going. I'm going.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.230
Can you buy me followers?

34:27.232 --> 34:29.114
That's not how you do things.

34:29.117 --> 34:30.500
Grandma does it.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.418
Case in point. Go!

34:32.420 --> 34:34.020
Come on.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.498
You okay?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.967
Yeah, I'm all right.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.922
Tell me something nice
about faith.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.040
Faith?

34:54.042 --> 34:56.525
Yeah, a good memory.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.764
I ran into a brick wall.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.884
Playing high-school ball.

35:04.886 --> 35:08.871
Couldn't quite put my bat
on a 90-mile-an-hour fastball.

35:08.873 --> 35:12.925
And, um, she saw me moping
about it one day,

35:12.927 --> 35:14.177
Asked what the problem was.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.729
I told her.

35:16.731 --> 35:18.598
And she told me I could do it.

35:21.803 --> 35:25.221
"My big brother
can do anything."

35:27.008 --> 35:29.258
She wasn't wrong.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.880
Come on.

35:34.949 --> 35:36.399
Let's not be late.

35:46.010 --> 35:50.663
We know we missed
the signs with faith,

35:50.665 --> 35:53.216
But what else did we miss?

35:53.218 --> 35:55.902
What are we...
What are we missing today.

35:55.904 --> 35:59.455
With each other,
missing in ourselves?

35:59.457 --> 36:01.607
Because those other secrets,

36:01.609 --> 36:03.710
Doubts, resentments,

36:03.712 --> 36:05.128
Sympathies unspoken,

36:05.130 --> 36:07.380
Dreams unvoiced,

36:07.382 --> 36:11.017
They're all still with us today.

36:11.019 --> 36:14.737
If there's any good.

36:14.739 --> 36:18.474
That can come
from the loss of our daughter,

36:18.476 --> 36:21.210
Sister, auntie, friend,

36:21.212 --> 36:23.946
Faith marie, it's this...

36:23.948 --> 36:26.666
That we can be more open
with each other.

36:26.668 --> 36:28.935
In the time that we have left,

36:28.937 --> 36:31.454
More generous with our kindness,

36:31.456 --> 36:33.706
More courageous
when it comes to sharing.

36:33.708 --> 36:36.576
The secrets
that shadow our hearts.

36:36.578 --> 36:40.630
Because we know today,
more sharply than most,

36:40.632 --> 36:43.566
After we're gone,

36:43.568 --> 36:47.503
The time for saying has past.

36:47.505 --> 36:51.924
And while the wordless truths
of heaven will be sweet,

36:51.926 --> 36:56.896
There's a sweetness
to be had here, too.

36:56.898 --> 36:59.515
It is, after all,

36:59.517 --> 37:01.734
God's world.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.017
Hey. Hey.

37:35.019 --> 37:37.637
Dad duty?

37:37.639 --> 37:39.605
Yeah, yeah.

37:39.607 --> 37:40.706
Thought you might be here.

37:40.708 --> 37:43.226
Hey.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.812
What is that, tar heels?

37:45.814 --> 37:47.897
You want to watch? Yeah.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.633
Yeah, if it's,
not too much trouble.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.285
Not at all. Come on in.

38:34.829 --> 38:36.746
Hey, "z."

38:37.916 --> 38:39.282
Hey.

38:40.335 --> 38:42.401
Sorry about my birthday.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.820
Birthday?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.155
Yeah.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.824
What about it?

38:48.826 --> 38:51.093
Trying to make you stay,

38:51.095 --> 38:53.296
Making you choose or trying to.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.181
It's no big deal.

38:55.183 --> 38:57.516
It seemed like it at the time.

38:57.518 --> 39:00.603
I forgot about it. It's cool.

39:28.983 --> 39:30.383
Thank you.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.807
Just what you wanted? Yes.

39:39.027 --> 39:42.295
Maricel, this is heavenly...

39:42.297 --> 39:44.380
Just like I wanted it.
Thank you so much.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.599
Been my pleasure, ma'am.

39:48.536 --> 39:51.103
Son.

39:52.540 --> 39:54.140
Who are those from?

39:54.142 --> 39:57.326
You know, probably darlene
and vida.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.562
She mentioned that they were...

40:00.564 --> 40:04.033
What? Where are they from?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.618
You stay with the family.

40:05.620 --> 40:08.537
Wait. Where are you going?

40:43.408 --> 40:45.124
You think there's not gonna be.

40:45.126 --> 40:46.726
Consequences messing in my life!

40:46.728 --> 40:48.094
Mac, what have you done?

40:48.963 --> 40:51.130
This is a spiritual danger zone.

40:51.132 --> 40:52.765
Can I go to nashville?

40:53.768 --> 40:55.951
You're in sin! Just say it!

40:55.953 --> 40:58.087
I'm in sin! I'm in sin!

40:58.089 --> 40:59.171
I don't have anyone else.

40:59.173 --> 41:01.273
It drives you nuts
that mac's free.

41:01.275 --> 41:02.275
Let it go.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.678
You hurt those girls!
You are sick!

41:05.680 --> 41:07.413
I didn't hurt...

41:07.415 --> 41:09.615
