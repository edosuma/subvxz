I'm sorry, no visitors.

05:39.118 --> 05:41.493
Well, but Major Burov told me,

05:41.577 --> 05:42.951
-he said--
-No exceptions.

05:43.034 --> 05:45.785
Please. I've come all the way

-Yeah.

-You're not pregnant,

that to you.

06:59.743 --> 07:00.993

No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

07:02.993 --> 07:04.285

08:44.618 --> 08:46.493
-Are you suggesting I did?
-Someone did.

08:46.577 --> 08:50.034
Someone decided
that the evacuation zone

08:50.118 --> 08:53.326
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

08:53.410 --> 08:56.076
Cesium-137
in the Gomel district.

08:56.159 --> 08:58.535
-That's 200 kilometers away!
-It was decided.

08:58.618 --> 09:01.118
-Based on what?
-I don't know!

09:02.285 --> 09:06.368
Forgive me. Maybe I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

09:06.451 --> 09:08.201
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

09:08.285 --> 09:11.493
Is this really the way
it all works?

09:11.577 --> 09:13.493
An uninformed,
arbitrary decision

09:13.577 --> 09:15.827
that will cost who knows
how many lives

09:15.909 --> 09:19.868

Pikalov:
Comrades...

09:31.118 --> 09:33.702
We have visual confirmation
that the fire is nearly
extinguished.

09:33.785 --> 09:35.993
There has also been
a reduction in iodine 131

09:36.076 --> 09:38.076
and cesium-137 emissions.

09:38.159 --> 09:40.076
Good. Yes?

09:40.159 --> 09:43.076
Pikalov:
But the temperature
is rising.

09:43.159 --> 09:44.660
And, uh...

09:51.702 --> 09:54.827
There's a spike
in zirconium-95.

09:55.993 --> 09:59.285
It's from the cladding
on the fuel rods.

09:59.368 --> 10:01.743
Meaning what?

10:01.827 --> 10:04.368
The meltdown has begun.

11:51.034 --> 11:53.159
-Yes?
-Man (over phone):
Comrade Shcherbina is
on the phone.

11:53.243 --> 11:54.660
Put him through.

11:56.118 --> 11:57.285
Well?

11:57.368 --> 11:58.993
Shcherbina:
The fire's nearly out.

11:59.076 --> 12:00.743
The bubbler tanks
are being drained.

12:00.827 --> 12:03.951
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

12:04.034 --> 12:05.993
(sighs)

12:07.159 --> 12:08.201
And?

12:09.702 --> 12:11.201
The situation inside the core

12:11.285 --> 12:14.076
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

12:14.159 --> 12:17.034
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

12:17.118 --> 12:20.326
but after that,
Legasov estimates a 50% chance

12:20.410 --> 12:22.493
that the fuel will
breach the pad

12:22.577 --> 12:24.993
and melt down into
the groundwater itself.

12:25.076 --> 12:28.368
(stammers)
And where does this
groundwater go?

12:28.451 --> 12:30.410
The Pripyat River,

12:30.493 --> 12:33.410
which feeds into the Dnieper.

12:33.493 --> 12:37.034
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

12:37.118 --> 12:38.868
not to mention crops
and livestock,

12:38.951 --> 12:40.993
would be... unusable.

12:41.076 --> 12:43.951
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

12:44.034 --> 12:47.034
to lower to core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

12:47.118 --> 12:51.201
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need...

12:52.660 --> 12:56.702
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

12:58.618 --> 12:59.827
Gorbachev:
Oh.

13:01.118 --> 13:03.535
- All right.
-Yeah, and of course,
we'll also need--

13:03.618 --> 13:05.159
Whatever you need,
you have it.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.660
- That should be
clear by now.
-Yes.

13:06.743 --> 13:08.285
- Anything else?
-No, no, no. Thank you.

13:08.368 --> 13:11.285
Yes. I'd like to address
the 30-kilometer
exclusion zone.

13:11.368 --> 13:14.451
Wait, what?
Professor Legasov,
is that you?

13:14.535 --> 13:15.535
What exclusion zone?

13:15.618 --> 13:17.702
Minor details,
General Secretary.

13:17.785 --> 13:20.285
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that--

13:20.368 --> 13:22.451
If he determined,
then he determined.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.201
Look, Professor Legasov,

13:24.285 --> 13:26.285
you    are there
for one reason only.

13:26.368 --> 13:28.451
Do you understand?
To make this stop.

13:28.535 --> 13:29.827
I don't want questions.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.618
I want to know when
this will be over.

13:31.702 --> 13:33.868
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

13:33.951 --> 13:37.076
the half-life of plutonium-239
is 24,000 years.

13:37.159 --> 13:40.368
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

13:42.159 --> 13:43.743
(line clicks)

13:52.702 --> 13:54.618
I think you and I
should take a walk.

13:54.702 --> 13:56.743
It's late. I'm tired.

13:57.743 --> 14:00.285
We're taking a walk.

14:02.076 --> 14:04.243
(dog panting)

14:06.743 --> 14:09.326
Was it it you want?
An apology?

14:10.702 --> 14:12.368
Not gonna sit back and...

14:12.451 --> 14:14.451
-(dog whining)
-(Legasov sighs)

14:14.535 --> 14:17.493
What will happen
to our boys?

14:17.577 --> 14:19.868
Which boys?
The divers?

14:19.951 --> 14:23.285
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

14:23.368 --> 14:26.951
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

14:28.577 --> 14:31.285
At the levels some
of them were exposed?

14:31.368 --> 14:35.201
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

14:35.285 --> 14:38.868
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

14:39.993 --> 14:42.702
This is followed
by a latency period.

14:43.785 --> 14:45.577
The immediate
effects subside.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.702
The patient appears
to be recovering.

14:48.785 --> 14:51.201
Healthy, even.
But they aren't.

14:52.785 --> 14:56.326
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

14:58.702 --> 14:59.993
Continue.

15:01.159 --> 15:04.868
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

15:04.951 --> 15:10.285
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

15:10.368 --> 15:14.159
the organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

15:14.243 --> 15:18.243
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

15:18.326 --> 15:20.785
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

15:20.868 --> 15:25.118
for the pain,
which is... unimaginable.

15:25.201 --> 15:28.702
And then three days
to three weeks, you are dead.

15:30.951 --> 15:33.368
That is what will happen
to those boys.

15:35.493 --> 15:36.993
And what about us?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.909
Well, we've...

15:41.993 --> 15:46.159
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

15:46.243 --> 15:48.243
Not strong enough
to kill the cells,

15:48.326 --> 15:51.368
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.118
So, in time... cancer.

15:56.201 --> 15:59.410
Or aplastic anemia.
Either way, fatal.

16:02.368 --> 16:03.743
Well...

16:05.326 --> 16:11.243
in a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

16:23.785 --> 16:25.785
I've seen them before.

16:31.535 --> 16:34.785
Now you know why
I wanted to take a walk.

16:34.909 --> 16:37.410
We can presume
the work site is bugged.

16:38.076 --> 16:41.993
And our rooms,
even our bathrooms.

16:42.076 --> 16:44.493
They've been here
the whole time.

16:44.577 --> 16:46.660
Of course they've been
here the whole time.

16:47.909 --> 16:51.493
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

16:51.577 --> 16:54.410
it's because
they want us to know.

17:01.326 --> 17:04.076
(distant helicopters thrumming)

17:11.326 --> 17:14.577
(door opens, closes)

17:36.201 --> 17:37.660
Khomyuk:
You've seen that?

17:39.909 --> 17:42.034
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

17:42.118 --> 17:45.159
I know. I have a plan.

17:45.243 --> 17:47.868
Heat exchanger, I hope.

17:47.951 --> 17:49.451
Yes.

17:52.368 --> 17:54.368
There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

17:54.451 --> 17:57.868
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

18:01.868 --> 18:04.243
Why did it explode?

18:05.743 --> 18:07.951
I've worked the numbers
over and over,

18:08.034 --> 18:11.909
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.243
And I always get
the same answer.

18:16.326 --> 18:17.827
Which is?

18:19.159 --> 18:21.410
It's not possible.

18:21.493 --> 18:22.993
And yet...

18:26.076 --> 18:28.326
You're not going
to solve this here.

18:29.868 --> 18:31.493
Not on paper.

18:32.993 --> 18:34.868
Everyone who was
in the control room,

18:34.951 --> 18:37.243
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

18:37.326 --> 18:41.493
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

18:41.577 --> 18:44.785
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

18:44.868 --> 18:48.410
moment by moment,
decision by decision.

18:49.618 --> 18:51.909
Go now while
they're still alive.

18:51.993 --> 18:53.868
Talk to them.

18:53.951 --> 18:56.827
Because if we don't find out
how this happened,

18:56.909 --> 18:59.243
it will happen again.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.951
And, Khomyuk...

19:05.410 --> 19:07.743
be careful.

19:13.909 --> 19:15.451
(elevator dings)

19:18.368 --> 19:20.410
(trucks rumbling)

19:31.577 --> 19:32.951
Well, fuck you!

19:33.034 --> 19:35.993
(men laughing)

19:36.076 --> 19:38.076
Hey, here's one, here's one.

19:38.159 --> 19:40.076
What's as big as a house,

19:40.159 --> 19:43.034
burns 20 liters
of fuel every hour,

19:43.118 --> 19:44.993
puts out a shit-load
of smoke and noise,

19:45.076 --> 19:48.993
and cuts an apple
into three pieces?

19:51.034 --> 19:54.451
A Soviet machine made to cut
apples into four pieces!

19:54.535 --> 19:56.827
(men laughing)

20:01.034 --> 20:03.159
(men laughing)

20:33.785 --> 20:36.951
-Who's in charge here?
-Glukhov: I'm the crew chief.

20:37.034 --> 20:41.034
I am Shadov,
minister of coal industries.

20:41.118 --> 20:42.785
We know who you are.

20:44.909 --> 20:46.410
How many men do you have?

20:46.493 --> 20:50.618
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

20:50.702 --> 20:55.076
I need all 100 men
to gather their equipment
and get in the trucks.

20:55.159 --> 20:58.660
Do you? To where?

21:00.159 --> 21:01.493
That's classified.

21:07.827 --> 21:08.993
Come on, then.

21:09.076 --> 21:10.702
Start shooting.

21:10.785 --> 21:13.993
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

21:14.076 --> 21:16.076
Kill as many as you can,
whoever's left,

21:16.159 --> 21:17.993
they'll beat the living piss
out of each of you.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.410
-Soldier: You can't talk
to us like that!
-Shut the fuck up!

21:21.493 --> 21:24.326
This is Tula.
This is our mine.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.410
We don't leave
unless we know why.

21:29.201 --> 21:30.577
Mm.

21:34.451 --> 21:36.535
You're going to Chernobyl.

21:38.577 --> 21:40.951
Do you know
what's happened there?

21:41.034 --> 21:43.285
We dig up coal, not bodies.

21:43.368 --> 21:46.535
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

21:46.618 --> 21:49.868
and poison the water
from Kiev to the Black Sea.

21:49.951 --> 21:51.410
All of it.

21:52.326 --> 21:53.909
Forever, they say.

21:55.827 --> 21:59.118
They want you to stop
that from happening.

21:59.201 --> 22:01.451
And how are
we supposed to do that?

22:02.868 --> 22:06.118
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.118
Do you need to know,
or have you heard enough?

22:37.326 --> 22:38.743
(pats)

22:42.326 --> 22:44.993
(men muttering)

22:50.993 --> 22:53.993
Now you look like
the minister of coal.

23:07.201 --> 23:09.159
(labored breathing)

23:13.285 --> 23:15.368
(moans softly)

23:15.451 --> 23:16.951
Vasya?

23:18.451 --> 23:19.785
Vasya?

23:20.785 --> 23:23.368
(inhales sharply)

23:25.868 --> 23:27.785
(softly):
No, no, no.

23:27.868 --> 23:30.118
They told you no touching.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.451
It's not safe.

23:32.535 --> 23:34.827
They touch you.
(kisses)

23:35.868 --> 23:37.993
If it's safe for them,
it's safe for me.

23:40.743 --> 23:43.326
(breathing shakily)

23:47.993 --> 23:49.909
Where are the others?

23:49.993 --> 23:52.493
They took them
to a special room.

23:53.451 --> 23:55.201
They won't tell me where.

23:59.493 --> 24:01.951
Will you open the curtains?

24:02.034 --> 24:05.326
-Hmm?
-Open the curtains.

24:08.743 --> 24:10.410
Aah.

24:10.493 --> 24:12.577
(panting)

24:14.868 --> 24:16.285
(grunts softly)

24:21.868 --> 24:23.951
(laughing)

24:27.410 --> 24:30.326
Please, tell me
what you see outside.

24:30.410 --> 24:31.951
Tell me everything.

24:39.535 --> 24:40.868
Huh.

24:42.451 --> 24:44.535
I can see the Red Square.

24:47.285 --> 24:49.326
And...

24:49.410 --> 24:51.118
the Kremlin.

24:52.368 --> 24:55.827
Spasskaya Tower,
the Mausoleum.

24:58.201 --> 25:00.702
You see St. Basil's?

25:00.785 --> 25:02.909
Yeah.

25:02.993 --> 25:04.868
Ah.

25:04.951 --> 25:06.743
Yes, it's beautiful.

25:08.368 --> 25:10.159
I told you.

25:10.243 --> 25:13.577
I told you I'd show
you Moscow, remember?

25:13.660 --> 25:16.618
-Huh?
-Yeah. Yes.

25:22.410 --> 25:24.243
Thank you.

25:28.034 --> 25:30.827
(softly panting)

25:42.034 --> 25:44.118
(man groans)

25:47.201 --> 25:48.785
(man retches)

26:00.660 --> 26:03.034
(labored breathing)

26:11.368 --> 26:14.201
I'm not eating that.
It's shit.

26:14.951 --> 26:17.201
Get me something else.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.034
I'm not a nurse,
Comrade Dyatlov.

26:20.118 --> 26:22.076
I'm a nuclear physicist.

26:22.785 --> 26:25.410
Well, then, Comrade
Nuclear Physicist...

26:26.702 --> 26:31.159
unless you happen to have
a butter and caviar sandwich
on you,

26:31.243 --> 26:34.493
you can get the fuck
out of my room.

27:52.243 --> 27:53.577
What?

27:55.076 --> 27:57.577
I'm not good at this, Boris.

27:57.660 --> 27:59.410
The lying.

28:03.868 --> 28:06.785
Have you ever spent
time with miners?

28:08.451 --> 28:09.743
No.

28:09.827 --> 28:12.368
My advice: tell the truth.

28:12.451 --> 28:16.076
These men work in the dark.
They see everything.

28:17.451 --> 28:19.951
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

28:35.368 --> 28:37.285
Do these work?

28:38.201 --> 28:39.993
To an extent.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.660
Of course.

28:56.285 --> 28:58.618
So what's the job?

28:59.827 --> 29:03.410
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

29:03.493 --> 29:06.618
underneath this concrete pad.

29:06.702 --> 29:10.618
There's no way to approach
from the interior
of the building,

29:10.702 --> 29:12.743
so you have to get at it
from underground.

29:12.827 --> 29:16.618
-And what's above the pad?
-The core of
the nuclear reactor,

29:16.702 --> 29:19.660
which is melting down.

29:19.743 --> 29:22.326
What? Like...

29:23.868 --> 29:25.076
Essentially.

29:26.909 --> 29:28.243
Is it gonna fall
on top of us?

29:28.326 --> 29:30.326
Not if you're done
within six weeks.

29:32.285 --> 29:34.159
Dimensions?

29:37.159 --> 29:39.076
Break ground here,

29:39.159 --> 29:41.451
dig a tunnel
150 meters to here,

29:41.535 --> 29:44.660
excavate a space
30 by 30 meters

29:44.743 --> 29:46.368
for the heat exchanger.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.618
And because we need to keep
disruption of the ground above
to a minimum,

29:49.702 --> 29:51.577
you can't use
any heavy machinery.

29:51.660 --> 29:53.034
It has to be done by hand.

29:53.118 --> 29:55.410
Then I need more men.

29:56.951 --> 29:58.285
Four hundred at least.

29:58.368 --> 30:00.868
We'll have to work
around the clock.

30:00.951 --> 30:02.785
How deep do you want
this tunnel? Six meters?

30:02.868 --> 30:05.785
-Twelve.
-Twelve? Why?

30:05.868 --> 30:08.368
For your protection.

30:08.451 --> 30:12.285
At that depth,
you'll be shielded from
much of the radiation.

30:12.368 --> 30:16.618
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

30:17.909 --> 30:19.743
No.

30:19.827 --> 30:22.868
And we're not 12 meters
below ground now.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.451
No. We're not.

30:33.201 --> 30:35.201
Shcherbina:
We have some equipment
here on site.

30:35.285 --> 30:38.451
More will arrive
by midnight.

30:39.951 --> 30:41.451
You can start
in the morning.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.034
No. We start now.

30:43.118 --> 30:47.076
I don't want my men here
one more second than
they need to be.

30:48.909 --> 30:52.577
If these worked,
you'd be wearing them.

30:58.243 --> 31:00.076
(sighs)

31:02.493 --> 31:04.201
Are they all like that?

31:04.285 --> 31:06.660
They're all like that.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.868
(lantern rattling)

31:30.868 --> 31:32.951
(men grunting)

32:21.368 --> 32:23.535
(men shouting indistinctly)

32:30.827 --> 32:32.034
Miner:
Yes?

32:32.118 --> 32:34.702
-What's it up to?
-Uh, 50 degrees.

32:39.034 --> 32:40.285
Fuck!

32:44.577 --> 32:46.451
Glukhov:
Hey!

32:46.535 --> 32:47.909
Hey you!

32:57.285 --> 33:00.285
-We need fans.
-For what purpose?

33:00.368 --> 33:02.201
What do you mean,
"For what purpose?"

33:02.285 --> 33:03.993
To dig your fucking tunnel,
that's why.

33:04.076 --> 33:06.951
-Who's talking to you?
-Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

33:07.034 --> 33:09.410
It's 50 degrees down there.

33:09.493 --> 33:11.118
We can't breathe
without the masks,

33:11.201 --> 33:12.660
we can't breathe
with the masks.

33:12.743 --> 33:15.618
It's like a fucking oven.
We need ventilation.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.827
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.577
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

33:21.660 --> 33:24.285
Not this dust.
I'm sorry.

33:24.368 --> 33:27.577
For your own good,
no fans.

33:34.285 --> 33:36.410
(man gasping quietly)

33:45.243 --> 33:47.410
(labored breathing)

33:55.577 --> 33:57.702
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

33:57.785 --> 34:01.285
I'm a nuclear physicist
with the Chernobyl Commission.

34:03.118 --> 34:05.243
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

34:05.326 --> 34:07.451
on the night of the accident.

34:08.451 --> 34:10.118
Is that all right?

34:12.868 --> 34:14.159
Yes.

34:16.285 --> 34:17.868
I want to tell.

34:18.951 --> 34:20.493
All right.

34:31.118 --> 34:33.034
(wheezing)

34:33.118 --> 34:35.951
Your official title was?

34:38.493 --> 34:43.243
My name is Leonid
Fedorovych Toptunov.

34:43.326 --> 34:49.493
I am the senior reactor
control chief engineer

34:49.577 --> 34:52.201
at Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.201
Senior engineer?

35:00.159 --> 35:01.993
How old are you?

35:06.618 --> 35:08.743
(gasping):
I'm 25.

35:50.909 --> 35:53.034
(gurney rattling)

35:56.493 --> 35:58.368
Vasily (weakly):
Lyusya? Lyusya?

35:58.451 --> 36:00.868
Yes, I'm here,
I'm here. I'm...

36:10.326 --> 36:12.451
(labored breathing)

36:15.868 --> 36:17.951
Have you been here
this whole time?

36:18.034 --> 36:20.577
No one said
I should leave.

36:20.660 --> 36:21.993
I did.

36:22.076 --> 36:23.326
Thirty minutes, I said!

36:23.410 --> 36:26.909
Well, where have you been?
When he's in pain?

36:26.993 --> 36:28.243
When his sores
stick to his gown?

36:28.326 --> 36:29.951
When he soils himself
five times a night?

36:30.034 --> 36:31.827
I've been looking after him.
Where have you been?

36:31.909 --> 36:33.743
I've been In the north
and west wing,

36:33.827 --> 36:37.326
where there are dozens
of patients from Chernobyl
exactly like him.

36:37.410 --> 36:39.076
-It isn't safe for you here.
-He's my husband.

36:39.159 --> 36:40.201
Not anymore.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.159
He's something else now.
Do you understand?

36:42.243 --> 36:44.993
He's dangerous to you.

36:45.076 --> 36:47.618
He's burned.

36:47.702 --> 36:49.368
Go home.

36:50.159 --> 36:51.535
Please.

36:54.618 --> 36:57.493
It won't take much longer.
I, uh...

37:00.993 --> 37:03.951
I don't want him
to die alone.

37:06.159 --> 37:08.493
Stay on the other side
of the plastic.

37:10.076 --> 37:11.951
Or I'll have you
removed by security.

37:20.368 --> 37:23.618
-(door opens, closes)
-(labored breathing)

37:27.535 --> 37:29.660
(Vasily wheezing)

38:11.201 --> 38:13.368
-Lyusya?
-Yes, my love.

38:16.368 --> 38:19.118
Is it day?

38:19.201 --> 38:21.451
No, it's nighttime now.

38:25.410 --> 38:27.285
I think I had a dream,

38:27.368 --> 38:29.285
it's just gone.

38:30.951 --> 38:32.535
Vasya.

38:38.201 --> 38:40.201
We're going to have a baby.

38:41.451 --> 38:43.577
(labored breathing)

39:09.285 --> 39:12.451
(door opens, closes)

39:17.034 --> 39:18.410
The fire's out.

39:21.076 --> 39:22.660
It's out, Valera.

39:23.785 --> 39:26.410
The miners are making
incredible progress.

39:27.410 --> 39:30.618
They say the whole job
will be finished in four weeks.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.243
Four weeks.

39:34.326 --> 39:36.451
Can you believe that?

39:42.243 --> 39:44.451
I know the job isn't over.

39:45.993 --> 39:47.993
But it's the beginning
of the end.

39:50.618 --> 39:52.451
-(knocking)
-(door opens)

39:53.577 --> 39:56.451
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister, but...

39:58.410 --> 39:59.785
it is the miners.

39:59.868 --> 40:03.285
-(metal striking dirt)
-(miners grunting, coughing)

40:29.785 --> 40:31.993
(indistinct shouting)

40:47.993 --> 40:49.243
What?

40:49.326 --> 40:51.909
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

40:51.993 --> 40:55.034
So we're digging the old way.
This is how our fathers mined.

40:57.034 --> 40:58.827
We're still wearing
the fucking hats.

40:58.909 --> 41:00.702
What do you want?

41:03.702 --> 41:06.451
You're not as protected now.

41:06.535 --> 41:09.243
Are you telling me
it will make a difference?

41:14.493 --> 41:16.577
When this is over,

41:16.660 --> 41:18.577
will they be looked after?

41:22.076 --> 41:23.868
I don't know.

41:34.618 --> 41:36.410
You don't know.

41:51.285 --> 41:53.410
(labored breathing)

41:55.076 --> 42:00.159
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

42:00.243 --> 42:02.076
Yes.

42:02.993 --> 42:04.743
Very fast.

42:06.076 --> 42:09.618
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

42:09.702 --> 42:12.410
Why didn't you press
the AZ-5 button?

42:13.993 --> 42:15.285
We did.

42:15.368 --> 42:18.951
I reported the increase
to Akimov,

42:19.034 --> 42:21.118
and he pressed
the button.

42:22.118 --> 42:25.535
Leonid, that's...
that's not possible.

42:26.993 --> 42:28.785
He did.

42:28.868 --> 42:30.827
I s-swear.

42:30.909 --> 42:33.034
I saw him do it.

42:36.618 --> 42:38.868
And that's
when it exploded.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.118
What?

42:45.368 --> 42:47.118
(door opens)

42:50.868 --> 42:52.951
(cart rattling)

42:56.951 --> 42:58.159
Khomyuk:
Um...

42:59.285 --> 43:02.368
-Which room is Akimov?
-Twenty-seven.

43:09.493 --> 43:11.535
(crying)

43:17.159 --> 43:21.076
Akimov:
I pressed it...
before the explosion.

43:21.159 --> 43:22.868
Before.

43:24.993 --> 43:27.618
(weakly):
But why?

43:27.702 --> 43:29.743
Why would that happen?

43:31.201 --> 43:34.660
I shut it down.
I pressed AZ-5.

43:36.493 --> 43:38.326
(Khomyuk breathes shakily)

43:40.451 --> 43:42.410
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

43:44.535 --> 43:47.159
(labored breathing)

43:47.243 --> 43:49.285
Akimov:
I did everything right.

43:50.743 --> 43:52.868
I did everything right.

43:54.076 --> 43:55.702
(Khomyuk sighs)

44:23.909 --> 44:25.451
(whispering):
Get out.

44:25.535 --> 44:27.076
Get out. Get out of here.

44:27.159 --> 44:29.493
Let me go! Let me go!

44:29.577 --> 44:32.118
Stop it! Stop it!

44:34.743 --> 44:37.368
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic,
touching him?

44:37.451 --> 44:39.993
-Did you know she's pregnant?
-It's not true!

44:40.076 --> 44:43.785
-What have you done?
-What kind of place is this?
Where is her protection?

44:43.868 --> 44:46.827
-Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?
-Of course I do.

44:46.909 --> 44:48.368
-Please, I do not--
-No.

44:48.451 --> 44:50.660
-People are going
to hear about this.
-Wait.

44:50.743 --> 44:52.493
People are going to hear.
Do you understand?

44:52.577 --> 44:54.493
Everyone is going to hear.

44:54.577 --> 44:56.618
Man:
What is everyone
gonna hear?

45:02.785 --> 45:04.660
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission,

45:04.743 --> 45:06.868
and I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

45:06.951 --> 45:10.201
-You can check this.
My name is Ulana--
-We know who you are.

45:13.618 --> 45:16.535
What is everyone gonna hear?

45:36.493 --> 45:38.451
Shcherbina;
You have your notes?

45:38.535 --> 45:40.118
Yes.

45:42.368 --> 45:44.076
Khomyuk was arrested
last night.

45:44.159 --> 45:46.868
What? Why?

45:46.951 --> 45:48.410
I don't know.

45:49.577 --> 45:52.909
-Was it--?
-Of course it was.

45:54.326 --> 45:55.451
I'm working on it.

45:55.535 --> 45:58.368
-Boris--
-I'm working on it.

45:59.618 --> 46:01.743
What more do you
want from me?

46:01.827 --> 46:03.326
Fix your tie.

46:07.326 --> 46:08.702
(door opens)

46:09.827 --> 46:11.243
They'll see you now.

46:21.326 --> 46:24.909
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

46:24.993 --> 46:26.410
successfully
extinguished the fire.

46:26.493 --> 46:29.118
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

46:29.201 --> 46:31.326
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

46:31.410 --> 46:33.577
And furthermore,
there is no longer

46:33.660 --> 46:35.201
a threat of
additional explosion.

46:35.285 --> 46:40.118
The Soviet people
have faced the challenge
and risen to the task,

46:40.201 --> 46:42.785
and they and everyone
in this room are to be
commended.

46:47.993 --> 46:50.618
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

46:50.702 --> 46:53.076
to protect the security
interests of the State.

46:53.159 --> 46:55.743
And since the unfortunate
release of information

46:55.827 --> 46:57.118
directly following
the accident,

46:57.201 --> 47:00.159
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

47:00.243 --> 47:02.660
Comrade Charkov,

47:02.743 --> 47:06.702
we hope we have lived up
to the highest standards
of the KGB.

47:06.785 --> 47:07.827
You have.

47:07.909 --> 47:09.577
Shcherbina:
Thank you.

47:10.743 --> 47:14.118
Professor Legasov
will now speak about

47:14.201 --> 47:15.660
the work that remains.

47:17.785 --> 47:19.451
Thank you.

47:22.909 --> 47:25.827
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

47:25.909 --> 47:27.827
and it is good.

47:27.909 --> 47:30.451
The immediate danger is over.

47:30.535 --> 47:33.660
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

47:34.785 --> 47:37.535
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

47:37.618 --> 47:39.743
and contamination
spread out across a zone

47:39.827 --> 47:42.285
of approximately
2600 square kilometers.

47:42.368 --> 47:47.743
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

47:47.827 --> 47:51.951
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

47:52.034 --> 47:57.868
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

47:57.951 --> 48:00.577
whether domesticated or wild,

48:00.660 --> 48:04.909
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

48:04.993 --> 48:08.368
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

48:08.451 --> 48:11.868
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

48:11.951 --> 48:17.410
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

48:17.493 --> 48:21.368
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

48:21.451 --> 48:24.451
which will be carried
by the wind and the rain
if left exposed.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.868
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

48:26.951 --> 48:29.034
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

48:29.118 --> 48:30.410
and bury it under itself,

48:30.493 --> 48:34.034
approximately,
100 square kilometers.

48:35.743 --> 48:39.076
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

48:39.159 --> 48:44.118
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

48:44.201 --> 48:47.743
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

48:50.410 --> 48:52.326
There will be deaths.

48:55.660 --> 48:57.451
What amount of time,

48:57.535 --> 48:59.159
and how many men
do you require?

48:59.243 --> 49:02.993
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

49:03.076 --> 49:05.410
and approximately 750,000 men,

49:05.493 --> 49:10.868
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

49:10.951 --> 49:13.410
How many deaths?

49:13.493 --> 49:15.451
Thousands.

49:15.535 --> 49:18.076
Perhaps tens of thousands.

49:25.493 --> 49:27.201
Gorbachev:
Begin at once.

49:29.451 --> 49:31.535
(men murmuring)

49:32.618 --> 49:35.201
-Legasov: Comrade Charkov.
-Shcherbina: Valery!

49:36.868 --> 49:38.201
Yes, Professor?

49:39.243 --> 49:42.118
My associate was
arrested last night.

49:42.201 --> 49:43.535
Oh?

49:44.535 --> 49:47.743
I mean no disrespect,
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

49:47.827 --> 49:50.118
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

49:50.201 --> 49:52.993
She was arrested
by the KGB.

49:53.076 --> 49:56.118
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

49:56.201 --> 49:57.660
I am.

49:57.743 --> 50:00.660
That's why I don't have
to bother with arresting
people anymore.

50:00.743 --> 50:03.159
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

50:04.493 --> 50:06.951
I think the deputy
chairman is busy.

50:07.034 --> 50:09.159
No, no. It's perfectly
understandable.

50:09.243 --> 50:13.159
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

50:13.243 --> 50:15.577
When I hear them,
even I am shocked.

50:15.660 --> 50:17.577
But we are not
what people say.

50:17.660 --> 50:20.410
Yes, people are
following you.

50:20.493 --> 50:22.909
People are following
those people.

50:22.993 --> 50:24.243
You see them?

50:26.660 --> 50:28.368
They follow me.

50:28.451 --> 50:32.535
The KGB is a circle
of accountability.

50:32.618 --> 50:33.827
Nothing more.

50:33.909 --> 50:36.326
You know the work
we're doing here.

50:37.702 --> 50:40.451
-You really don't trust us?
-Of course I do.

50:40.535 --> 50:43.743
But you know
the old Russian proverb:

50:43.827 --> 50:45.868
"Trust but verify."

50:47.785 --> 50:51.368
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

50:51.451 --> 50:52.785
Can you imagine?

50:53.909 --> 50:56.368
It was very nice
speaking with you.

50:56.451 --> 50:58.034
I need her.

51:00.618 --> 51:03.201
So you will be
accountable for her?

51:07.785 --> 51:09.326
Then it's done.

51:10.159 --> 51:13.201
-Her name is--
-I know who she is.

51:13.285 --> 51:15.118
Good day, Professor.

51:24.827 --> 51:28.410
No, that went
surprisingly well.

51:28.493 --> 51:30.660
You came off like
a naive idiot.

51:32.034 --> 51:34.827
And naive idiots
are not a threat.

51:50.326 --> 51:52.993
Man:
I'll come back when
the paperwork is complete.

52:00.660 --> 52:03.577
-Are you all right?
-They didn't hurt me.

52:05.368 --> 52:07.868
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

52:07.951 --> 52:11.118
(sighs)
It doesn't matter.

52:11.201 --> 52:13.868
They were stupid.
I was stupid.

52:15.285 --> 52:17.285
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

52:18.493 --> 52:22.076
Akimov, yes,
Toptunov, yes, but...

52:22.159 --> 52:24.785
(sighs)
Valery,

52:24.868 --> 52:26.368
Akimov...

52:27.577 --> 52:29.285
his face was gone.

52:32.034 --> 52:33.702
You want to stop?

52:35.577 --> 52:38.034
Is that a choice I even have?

52:45.868 --> 52:49.660
Do you think the fuel will
actually melt through
the concrete pad?

52:49.743 --> 52:53.243
I don't know.
A 40% chance maybe.

52:55.743 --> 52:58.535
I said 50.
(chuckles)

52:58.618 --> 53:00.909
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing:

53:00.993 --> 53:03.034
"Maybe."

53:03.118 --> 53:04.827
(sighing)

53:04.909 --> 53:08.201
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

53:08.285 --> 53:10.660
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

53:10.743 --> 53:13.159
will save millions of lives.

53:14.410 --> 53:16.909
Maybe I'm killing them
for nothing.

53:20.743 --> 53:22.785
I don't want to do
this anymore.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.827
I want to stop.

53:27.535 --> 53:29.034
But I can't.

53:30.201 --> 53:33.285
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

53:34.660 --> 53:38.034
I think,
despite the stupidity,

53:38.118 --> 53:40.868
the lies, even this...

53:40.951 --> 53:43.034
you are compelled.

53:43.118 --> 53:45.535
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

53:45.618 --> 53:47.034
until you find an answer.

53:47.118 --> 53:50.285
Because that is
who you are.

53:52.118 --> 53:53.993
A lunatic, then.

53:55.827 --> 53:58.076
A scientist.

53:58.159 --> 54:00.034
(door unlocking)

54:19.034 --> 54:21.993
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

54:23.201 --> 54:25.993
-Yeah.
-There's something else.

54:27.326 --> 54:30.493
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

54:30.577 --> 54:32.909
and Toptunov confirms it.

54:32.993 --> 54:36.827
-They pressed AZ-5.
-Apparently not soon enough.

54:36.909 --> 54:38.451
No.

54:38.535 --> 54:43.159
They say Akimov
pressed AZ-5,

54:43.243 --> 54:45.868
and then
the reactor exploded.

54:47.326 --> 54:50.201
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

54:50.285 --> 54:52.535
faulty memory
or delusion even,

54:52.618 --> 54:56.410
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

55:00.909 --> 55:02.410
Comrade?

55:04.535 --> 55:08.118
-Do you think it's possible?
-I think it makes no sense.

55:08.201 --> 55:11.660
I think it's what
I would say if I was trying
to cover my own mistakes.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.368
But?

55:14.493 --> 55:16.201
I believed them.

55:18.326 --> 55:19.785
Then you should pursue it.

55:19.868 --> 55:23.868
We have to pursue
every possibility,

55:23.951 --> 55:26.535
no matter how unlikely,

55:26.618 --> 55:29.577
no matter what
or who's to blame.

55:31.076 --> 55:35.410
I'll go back to the hospital
and reinterview Akimov
and Toptunov.

55:38.034 --> 55:39.660
If they're still awake.

55:41.034 --> 55:42.618
They're not.
