00:04.385 --> 00:06.030
Judging from your test scores,

00:06.054 --> 00:07.573
I'd say you're
beginning to grasp

00:07.596 --> 00:09.742
the poetry of logarithms,

00:09.766 --> 00:11.660
and that's a good thing,
since this counts

00:11.684 --> 00:13.287
as one-fourth of
your final grade,

00:13.311 --> 00:15.780
and only two more
days before the exam.

00:18.066 --> 00:20.586
Tomorrow we dive into
oblique triangles.

00:20.610 --> 00:22.453
I know I'm excited.

00:31.829 --> 00:34.090
Your dog ate my homework?

00:35.375 --> 00:39.345
No. I just thought I would spare
you the embarrassment in class.

00:42.048 --> 00:43.525
Thanks... I guess.

00:43.549 --> 00:45.027
Don't tell me you're surprised.

00:45.051 --> 00:47.905
You disappeared for four
days just before the test.

00:47.929 --> 00:50.199
I know. I know. It's just...

00:50.223 --> 00:52.117
My life's been a little
complicated lately.

00:52.141 --> 00:54.235
I'm willing to give
you a second chance.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.872
There's a 10th grade Trig class
that meets during your study hall.

00:56.896 --> 00:58.749
Wait a second. 10th grade?

00:58.773 --> 01:01.752
They just started the
unit on logarithms.

01:01.776 --> 01:03.462
Ms. Baird, I'm a junior.

01:03.486 --> 01:04.754
Who's failing Math.

01:04.779 --> 01:06.799
I think you can swallow
your ego long enough

01:06.823 --> 01:09.000
to get your grades up to speed.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.213
Yes!

01:21.462 --> 01:24.724
How much time do we have left?

01:25.049 --> 01:27.768
Twelve minutes.

01:27.844 --> 01:29.446
Hello. Hey! No. No.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.907
You won't show me
yourself, so...

01:31.931 --> 01:33.951
No. Oh... It's ridiculous.

01:33.975 --> 01:35.035
It's no big deal.
Come on. It's...

01:35.059 --> 01:36.370
It's not that bad.

01:36.394 --> 01:37.579
What are you talking about?

01:37.603 --> 01:38.831
I look like a...

01:38.855 --> 01:40.416
I look like a convict
or something.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.700
Yeah, but a really sexy convict,

01:43.192 --> 01:45.713
who can now take us to
Mount Tam in the afternoon

01:45.737 --> 01:47.381
and Stinson Beach
on the weekends

01:47.405 --> 01:49.508
and that lookout point
on Twin Peaks at night.

01:49.532 --> 01:51.010
- Yeah.
- All those lights.

01:51.034 --> 01:53.085
A convict in his mom's Volvo.

01:53.453 --> 01:54.972
Who cares? It's freedom.

01:54.996 --> 01:56.932
We can go anywhere,
just the two of us.

01:56.956 --> 01:58.758
Alone.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.559
How much time do we have left?

02:09.134 --> 02:12.063
Nine minutes.

02:12.263 --> 02:14.616
No way.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.735
No way.

02:17.935 --> 02:18.912
No way!

02:18.936 --> 02:21.405
I said one onion, one olive.

02:22.273 --> 02:25.377
This isn't a joke, right?
Because if it is, I'll...

02:25.401 --> 02:29.048
Really? Tomorrow?

02:29.072 --> 02:30.257
Oh, man. Okay.

02:30.281 --> 02:32.676
Okay. All right.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.096
All right. I'll be there... I'll be
there in, 10 minutes. Okay? All right.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.848
Whoa, wait a minute.
Where are you going?

02:37.872 --> 02:39.349
I've got to split. Sorry.

02:39.373 --> 02:42.218
Get Kennedy to cover
for me, all right?

02:42.418 --> 02:44.929
Everybody, drinks are on me.

02:46.297 --> 02:48.057

03:49.152 --> 03:50.420
Well?

03:50.444 --> 03:51.713
That was perfect, Claud.

03:51.737 --> 03:53.757
What about my bowing
in the adagio?

03:53.781 --> 03:55.300
That sucked big time.

03:55.324 --> 03:57.678
Your bowing was perfect.
It was perfect.

03:57.702 --> 03:59.096
Would you stop saying that?

03:59.120 --> 04:02.558
How am I gonna learn anything if
you keep telling me I'm perfect?

04:02.582 --> 04:04.434
You're supposed
to be my teacher,

04:04.458 --> 04:06.886
so, teach, criticize.

04:07.128 --> 04:09.314
Tell me what I
should do different.

04:09.338 --> 04:10.691
What?

04:10.715 --> 04:12.308
You know what, Claudia?

04:12.717 --> 04:14.736
You're a better
violinist than I am.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.115
Oh, please. I am not.

04:18.139 --> 04:19.116
Duh.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.108
You are a great violinist.

04:21.350 --> 04:24.945
Tell you what. This time,
I'll play it again and...

04:25.438 --> 04:27.249
Pay attention.

04:27.273 --> 04:29.459
I don't need to hear it again,

04:29.483 --> 04:32.588
and even if I did, I can't think of
anything I could possibly tell you

04:32.612 --> 04:35.331
that would help you make the
leap from great to brilliant.

04:37.158 --> 04:38.927
I think you need a new teacher.

04:38.951 --> 04:40.179
But you're my teacher.

04:40.203 --> 04:42.181
And I've taught you
everything I know.

04:42.205 --> 04:46.059
I think you need to move
on to someone who can

04:46.083 --> 04:48.562
take your playing
to the next level,

04:48.586 --> 04:50.429
because I can't.

04:50.671 --> 04:54.642
That's why I played one of your
practice tapes for Gloria Metzler.

04:54.675 --> 04:56.153
Gloria Metzler?

04:56.177 --> 04:58.530
You remember. We heard her in
concert last year at Davies Hall.

04:58.554 --> 05:00.365
She only takes a two or
three students a year.

05:00.389 --> 05:02.024
She's agreed to take you.

05:03.226 --> 05:04.777
This is a good thing, Claudia.

05:04.936 --> 05:06.362
You're on your way.

05:17.198 --> 05:20.167
Guess it's getting a
little crowded in here...

05:20.993 --> 05:22.628
Hey.

05:22.828 --> 05:24.431
But it's okay.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.799
I mean, there's no place else.

05:34.924 --> 05:36.892
How's it been going?

05:36.968 --> 05:38.946
Fine.

05:38.970 --> 05:41.188
Never better.

05:41.347 --> 05:43.617
- You?
- Great.

05:43.641 --> 05:45.025
Just great.

05:45.559 --> 05:47.403
Sucks, huh?

05:47.561 --> 05:49.613
Totally.

05:52.984 --> 05:54.336
I...

05:54.360 --> 05:57.079
I heard about what
happened with Jill.

05:57.822 --> 06:00.124
Yeah, well...

06:00.199 --> 06:01.468
I'm sorry, man.

06:01.492 --> 06:04.712
I mean, for what it's
worth, coming from me.

06:05.871 --> 06:06.974
Yeah.

06:06.998 --> 06:10.143
Well, karma, I guess.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.720
- Trig?
- Trig hell.

06:13.379 --> 06:14.773
As if things weren't bad enough,

06:14.797 --> 06:17.192
Ms. Baird put me in a 10th grade
class for a couple of weeks.

06:17.216 --> 06:20.060
10th grade? Brutal.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.230
Like I'm ever going to need to
know how to solve a triangle.

06:23.389 --> 06:24.491
Come on, Bay.

06:24.515 --> 06:26.034
I mean, it might
not be that bad.

06:26.058 --> 06:29.079
Hey, a junior man among
sophomore women?

06:29.103 --> 06:30.789
They'll be lining up
to study with you.

06:30.813 --> 06:32.332
Yeah, some consolation.

06:32.356 --> 06:34.658
Hey, there's some
pretty hot sophomores.

06:37.194 --> 06:38.588
Julia.

06:38.612 --> 06:39.631
Bailey.

06:39.655 --> 06:42.342
- What are you doing here. -Well,
you must be Bailey Salinger.

06:42.366 --> 06:44.251
I, uh... I must be.

06:44.618 --> 06:48.714
I understand that you're having a
little trouble with logarithms.

06:49.373 --> 06:50.642
Did Ms. Baird mention

06:50.666 --> 06:52.686
that we're already two
days into the unit?

06:52.710 --> 06:55.095
Uh, no. She, uh...

06:55.212 --> 06:57.181
She left that part out.

06:57.381 --> 06:59.317
Well, it shouldn't be a problem.

06:59.341 --> 07:00.694
We'll get you some extra help.

07:00.718 --> 07:03.196
Well, uh... actually,
I could, uh...

07:03.220 --> 07:05.532
I could meet you after
school or something...

07:05.556 --> 07:07.816
Actually, I was thinking that
your sister could help you.

07:08.184 --> 07:09.411
- You mean...
- Me?

07:09.435 --> 07:10.954
Well, why not?

07:10.978 --> 07:13.498
Julia's doing very well
and you need a tutor.

07:13.522 --> 07:15.250
You both live in the same house.

07:15.274 --> 07:17.169
Sounds like the perfect
solution to me.

07:17.193 --> 07:19.504
Uh, well, I've actually
been pretty busy lately.

07:19.528 --> 07:21.048
And I'm pretty quick
on the uptake, so...

07:21.072 --> 07:23.050
And I'm sure Bailey
doesn't need my help,

07:23.074 --> 07:25.135
- right, Bay?
- Absolutely.

07:25.159 --> 07:27.169
It's not a request, guys.

07:29.455 --> 07:33.685
These projections are based
on 50 to 60 craftspeople,

07:33.709 --> 07:35.719
from joiners to finishers.

07:36.462 --> 07:39.691
Well, 60 sounds about right.

07:39.715 --> 07:41.068
But we,

07:41.092 --> 07:43.528
in order to be certain, we'd have
to see the production schedule.

07:43.552 --> 07:45.781
And that's tight, as you
can see from the calendar

07:45.805 --> 07:47.648
on page 12.

07:50.059 --> 07:51.953
Is that going to be
a problem for you?

07:51.977 --> 07:53.163
Well, that's...

07:53.187 --> 07:55.457
Doable. That's
definitely doable.

07:55.481 --> 07:58.242
- Good.
- So, I'm sorry,

07:58.275 --> 08:01.254
we would just become another
part of the Cromwell Collection?

08:01.278 --> 08:02.756
- Pages in a catalog?
- No.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.801
What we're looking for
is a prestige line.

08:05.825 --> 08:08.669
A limited edition of
fine furnishings.

08:08.744 --> 08:11.390
We want you to do exactly
what you have been doing,

08:11.414 --> 08:12.766
only on a much larger scale.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.142
And if that's okay with you,

08:14.166 --> 08:16.561
then on the issues
of salary, benefits,

08:16.585 --> 08:18.188
and profit participation,

08:18.212 --> 08:20.097
we're ready to talk
to your lawyers.

08:20.464 --> 08:22.526
Now, do you need some
time to think this over,

08:22.550 --> 08:25.227
or shall we toast?

08:32.268 --> 08:33.412
Stop it! I'm going to throw up!

08:33.436 --> 08:34.830
$65,000?

08:34.854 --> 08:36.947
Do you have any idea how
much money that is?

08:37.815 --> 08:39.950
It's $65,000!

08:40.443 --> 08:42.129
Can you say rich, Owen?

08:42.153 --> 08:43.755
And that doesn't
include profits.

08:43.779 --> 08:45.340
Did I mention I get
part of the profits?

08:45.364 --> 08:46.915
- Are you kidding? You're kidding!
- No!

08:47.283 --> 08:48.718
Part of the deal.

08:48.742 --> 08:51.054
Hey, Charlie, you can
buy me a Stradivarius!

08:51.078 --> 08:53.098
Just think of the thousands
of butts all over America

08:53.122 --> 08:54.975
that are gonna be planted
in your furniture!

We do!

09:10.055 --> 09:13.442
$65,000!

09:19.356 --> 09:21.793
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:21.817 --> 09:22.961
What's going on?

09:22.985 --> 09:25.338
No, no, come on in.
I just told them.

09:25.362 --> 09:26.506
We're kind of celebrating.

09:26.530 --> 09:29.342
Oh. Is this a bad time to go
over the deal memo with you?

09:29.366 --> 09:30.594
No. Why?

09:30.618 --> 09:31.595
Is there a problem?

09:31.619 --> 09:32.920
Well, it's nothing big.

09:33.037 --> 09:34.431
See, they were
incredibly generous

09:34.455 --> 09:36.641
with everything except
moving expenses.

09:36.665 --> 09:38.727
They're only offering
$3,000 to cover both of us,

09:38.751 --> 09:40.979
- which means we'd practically have to
share a truck and... -Wait a minute.

09:41.003 --> 09:42.355
What are you talking about?

09:42.379 --> 09:44.691
Well, there's no way we can both
move to Seattle for $3,000...

09:44.715 --> 09:47.476
Seattle? They never said
anything about Seattle.

09:48.219 --> 09:49.654
Yeah, but it was
understood, Charlie.

09:49.678 --> 09:52.115
I mean, that's where they're headquartered.
That's where the new factory is.

09:52.139 --> 09:53.283
- Gwen, hi!
- Hi.

09:53.307 --> 09:54.534
Charlie just told us the news.

09:54.558 --> 09:55.827
Congratulations.

09:55.851 --> 09:57.329
Isn't it amazing?
Come on, Come on.

09:57.353 --> 10:00.072
No shop talk, both of you.
We're celebrating!

10:13.202 --> 10:15.587
What do you think?

10:16.872 --> 10:18.549
Would you?

10:18.874 --> 10:20.634
Could you?

10:23.337 --> 10:25.138
Seattle.

10:26.674 --> 10:28.767
It rains in Seattle...

10:33.305 --> 10:35.983
But I guess I can finish
my dissertation anywhere,

10:37.101 --> 10:39.611
but I'm not really the
issue here, Charlie.

10:41.939 --> 10:44.950
Well, maybe it isn't an issue.

10:46.443 --> 10:50.414
I mean, the pros so
outweigh the cons.

10:50.781 --> 10:52.749
They'll see that, right?

10:53.242 --> 10:55.845
And what, Bailey has one
year of school left

10:55.869 --> 10:57.754
before he goes off
to college anyway,

10:58.122 --> 11:00.340
and Claudia...

11:00.958 --> 11:02.801
Well, she's so young.

11:02.876 --> 11:04.563
Kids that age, they...

11:04.587 --> 11:06.847
They adjust pretty well
to changes, right?

11:07.965 --> 11:10.475
They'll make new best friends
in, like, a half an hour.

11:12.761 --> 11:14.698
And, Julia, she...

11:14.722 --> 11:17.065
When was I told that I...

11:19.059 --> 11:20.694
Damn.

11:20.894 --> 11:23.363
I can't believe the
way things work out.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.704
Is the deal set yet?

11:31.322 --> 11:32.757
Well, maybe there's still time

11:32.781 --> 11:34.217
to make a few demands
of your own,

11:34.241 --> 11:36.219
like keeping the company here.

11:36.243 --> 11:38.003
The factory's in Seattle.

11:39.997 --> 11:41.766
Charlie, these
people came to you

11:41.790 --> 11:44.009
because you have
something they want.

11:46.170 --> 11:48.180
Right.

11:50.299 --> 11:52.309
That's true.

11:53.344 --> 11:54.561
Right.

11:55.095 --> 11:56.781
Right. They came to us.

11:56.805 --> 11:58.700
I mean, they need us on board

11:58.724 --> 12:00.118
if they want to
sell our designs,

12:00.142 --> 12:02.986
so why should they be the ones
to set all the conditions?

12:05.773 --> 12:09.159
Yeah. I mean, maybe if I put
together a proposal or something.

12:11.695 --> 12:13.506
One hour. You do all my chores.

12:13.530 --> 12:16.259
No way. That's worth
at least, like, three.

12:16.283 --> 12:17.927
It's your turn to scrape
Owen's diaper pail.

12:17.951 --> 12:19.721
That's three hours
over how many days?

12:19.745 --> 12:21.014
Every day until the test.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.599
That's, like, nine hours.

12:22.623 --> 12:23.933
It's a fair deal.

12:23.957 --> 12:25.769
It'll take you 45 minutes
to do my chores.

12:25.793 --> 12:27.645
Now, if you were willing
to repaint my bedroom...

12:27.669 --> 12:29.105
Look, Julia, do you really think

12:29.129 --> 12:30.982
this is an empowering
experience for me?

12:31.006 --> 12:33.068
What about me? I had a
date with Justin tonight.

12:33.092 --> 12:34.944
So what? You could suck face
with him any time you want.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.446
I only get one
shot at this test,

12:36.470 --> 12:39.439
so I'm gonna need, like, at least
an hour and a half every night.

12:41.558 --> 12:44.486
Okay, look, I'm only
going to say this once,

12:44.686 --> 12:46.748
but...

12:46.772 --> 12:48.740
I kind of need you here.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.795
- Okay.
- Great. Thank you.

12:51.819 --> 12:53.254
If Justin and I can
use your Jeep.

12:53.278 --> 12:54.547
What?

12:54.571 --> 12:56.633
- It's just for Saturday. He
got his license... - My Jeep?

12:56.657 --> 12:58.760
And his mom's going to Sonoma,
so we don't have a car.

12:58.784 --> 12:59.886
Yeah, but my Jeep?

12:59.910 --> 13:01.930
Look, do this and we'll
drop the chores,

13:01.954 --> 13:04.224
and I'll have you spouting
co-terminals in your sleep.

13:04.248 --> 13:05.799
It's my best offer.

13:06.583 --> 13:07.894
All right,

13:07.918 --> 13:10.563
but if you park in a lot, park at the
far end, I don't want any door dings.

13:10.587 --> 13:13.441
And don't park under any trees because
the bird poop eats away at the paint.

13:13.465 --> 13:15.434
Wait a second. You'd
better write this down.

13:17.052 --> 13:20.021
Chin up, dear. You're an
artist, not a beggar.

13:26.186 --> 13:27.455
Instrument higher.

13:27.479 --> 13:29.124
Has that always
been your position?

13:29.148 --> 13:30.583
Yep.

13:30.607 --> 13:33.827
Now I see we have a few
bad habits to break.

13:37.531 --> 13:39.801
Don't be so timid
with the music.

13:39.825 --> 13:41.719
Vivaldi should be
played as you feel it,

13:41.743 --> 13:43.420
not as if it's memorized.

13:47.416 --> 13:50.019
Flat. Flat. You're flat.

13:50.043 --> 13:51.479
Oh...

13:51.503 --> 13:53.388
Sorry.

13:54.339 --> 13:56.568
All right, dear,
that's enough for now.

13:56.592 --> 13:59.519
Ross, uh, how long did you
say she's been playing?

14:00.637 --> 14:02.699
Long enough.

14:02.723 --> 14:04.742
Could you, um...

14:04.766 --> 14:06.485
Could you give us
a minute, please?

14:08.729 --> 14:10.155
Certainly.

14:13.358 --> 14:15.503
What are you doing, Claudia?

14:15.527 --> 14:18.330
I guess I'm just not
ready for this yet.

14:18.822 --> 14:21.384
Maybe if you and I worked
together just a little more,

14:21.408 --> 14:24.836
- I'd be able to...
- I see. Come here.

14:27.289 --> 14:29.642
I know this is
difficult for you,

14:29.666 --> 14:31.603
but if you're going to be great,

14:31.627 --> 14:33.605
I mean really great
at something,

14:33.629 --> 14:36.598
you have to be willing to make
some pretty big sacrifices.

14:36.924 --> 14:39.476
You have to give up a few
things along the way.

14:40.886 --> 14:43.980
And now you have to give me up.

14:46.475 --> 14:48.443
I won't.

14:51.438 --> 14:52.957
So I went home last night

14:52.981 --> 14:54.167
and I looked at the figures,

14:54.191 --> 14:55.335
and I realized

14:55.359 --> 14:57.170
that 95 percent of
Cromwell's business

14:57.194 --> 14:59.412
is done in Northern California,

14:59.947 --> 15:03.426
so the way I've got it figured
you'd actually be saving

15:03.450 --> 15:05.178
about $25,000 a year

15:05.202 --> 15:07.379
if we continue to work
out of San Francisco.

15:08.330 --> 15:11.007
What about shipping
costs for materials?

15:12.334 --> 15:16.012
I'm sorry. Charlie and I actually
haven't had a chance to discuss this.

15:16.213 --> 15:18.983
Well, um... as far as
shipping costs are concerned,

15:19.007 --> 15:19.943
I think you'd find...

15:19.967 --> 15:21.694
Charlie, this deal
only works for us

15:21.718 --> 15:23.822
because we've got a
$6 million facility

15:23.846 --> 15:25.615
sitting idle in Seattle.

15:25.639 --> 15:26.574
I know, but...

15:26.598 --> 15:28.785
It doesn't make sense for us
to support two factories.

15:28.809 --> 15:31.913
Well, no, maybe not, but I think
if you take into account...

15:31.937 --> 15:34.207
You know, I think
what Monica is saying

15:34.231 --> 15:36.501
is that the deal only
works in Seattle.

15:36.525 --> 15:39.077
Still, if it's an
issue for you...

15:42.364 --> 15:44.843
It isn't, an issue.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.585
I just...

15:46.785 --> 15:49.004
Thought I'd ask.

15:50.581 --> 15:52.841
So it's the square root of five.

15:53.292 --> 15:55.687
Never mind. I have no idea
why that's the right answer.

15:55.711 --> 15:58.982
Because it's always X
squared plus Y squared

15:59.006 --> 16:00.567
equals R squared. This
is simple, Bailey.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.934
You'd have to be brain-dead
not to get this.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.196
Come on, Jule...

16:05.220 --> 16:06.406
It's probably Justin.
Give me a sec.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.782
Hello? Hi.

16:07.806 --> 16:08.825
It's Justin.

16:08.849 --> 16:10.410
What a surprise.

16:10.434 --> 16:11.536
Yeah, almost done.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.204
Bailey's really getting
the hang of this.

16:13.228 --> 16:15.748
You just saw him an hour ago. You're
going to see him in a half-hour.

16:15.772 --> 16:17.417
Aren't you guys getting a
little sick of each other?

16:17.441 --> 16:19.711
- I am.
- What? Uh, no.

16:19.735 --> 16:21.203
Bailey was just saying
something to me.

16:21.403 --> 16:22.621
Yeah.

16:22.946 --> 16:24.873
Sure, okay. What time?

16:25.032 --> 16:26.009
Julia.

16:26.033 --> 16:28.001
Justin...

16:36.084 --> 16:37.854
Yeah. Yes.

16:37.878 --> 16:40.263
Yes. Okay. Bye.

16:41.298 --> 16:43.818
You guys are just so adorable.

16:43.842 --> 16:45.194
My teeth are rotting.

16:45.218 --> 16:46.571
What's your problem?

16:46.595 --> 16:48.396
Could we just do this, please?

16:49.431 --> 16:50.950
Okay. Um...

16:50.974 --> 16:52.285
Just do these. They're easy.

16:52.309 --> 16:53.536
I'll take a look when
you're finished.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.495
I'm going to go change.

16:54.519 --> 16:57.081
Wait a second. We still
have like 25 minutes left.

16:57.105 --> 16:58.791
Well, I'm not leaving.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.877
God, what do you want me to do?
Hold your hand?

17:00.901 --> 17:03.129
No. No. I want you
to actually help me.

17:03.153 --> 17:04.422
What do you think
I've been doing

17:04.445 --> 17:06.340
five miserable hours
in the last two days?

17:06.365 --> 17:09.135
Mainly daydreaming about getting
to first base with Justin.

17:09.159 --> 17:10.428
Shut up, Bailey!

17:10.452 --> 17:13.138
Fine! Who cares if I fail Trig,

17:13.163 --> 17:14.933
as long as you get to
play in the sandbox

17:14.957 --> 17:16.424
with your stupid boyfriend?

17:16.666 --> 17:17.810
Oh, that's funny, Bay.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.512
Like you have the right
to call anyone stupid.

17:23.423 --> 17:26.017
God, Jule, when did you
turn into such a bitch?

17:27.844 --> 17:29.030
Hey, guys.

17:29.054 --> 17:30.323
We've got to have a
family conference

17:30.347 --> 17:31.564
in the living room, all right?

17:34.434 --> 17:35.495
Did you hear me?

17:35.519 --> 17:37.622
So it's not just a
good thing for me.

17:37.646 --> 17:39.656
It's a good thing for all of us.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.876
I mean, I'll be making
a lot more money,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.169
which means that we'll
be able to have

17:43.193 --> 17:44.712
pretty much anything
that we want,

17:44.736 --> 17:46.621
and, um,

17:47.155 --> 17:48.466
we'll just make the transition

17:48.490 --> 17:49.842
as easy as possible.

17:49.866 --> 17:51.511
- And, um...
- Seattle?

17:51.535 --> 17:52.679
God...

17:52.703 --> 17:54.055
Charlie...

17:54.079 --> 17:55.765
That means, like,
all new friends

17:55.789 --> 17:57.308
and a whole different school.

17:57.332 --> 17:58.758
I'm almost a senior.

17:59.251 --> 18:01.136
I can't leave here.

18:01.503 --> 18:03.346
Not now.

18:04.631 --> 18:06.109
Look, I'm not stupid.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.777
I know that this is
a major thing here,

18:07.801 --> 18:09.946
and I know that you guys
would be giving up a lot.

18:09.970 --> 18:13.408
I mean, I'm sorry
about Justin, Jule.

18:13.432 --> 18:14.983
Sorry?

18:15.142 --> 18:17.235
What good does that do?

18:17.519 --> 18:20.164
The point is, I really
don't have a choice here.

18:20.188 --> 18:22.125
If I don't move up there,

18:22.149 --> 18:23.626
I miss out on the whole deal.

18:23.650 --> 18:25.378
Look, Charlie, this is great.

18:25.402 --> 18:27.171
I mean, we're all
really proud of you,

18:27.195 --> 18:29.164
but the thing is, you
just started out.

18:29.489 --> 18:32.542
You know? I mean, maybe...
maybe if you waited awhile,

18:32.617 --> 18:33.720
something else would come along,

18:33.744 --> 18:34.887
you know? Something...

18:34.911 --> 18:36.389
Something closer to home.

18:36.413 --> 18:38.340
Well, that's a good idea.
I bet it will.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.562
Nothing like this is going
to come along again.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.814
This is a once in
a lifetime thing.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.639
You want us to sell the house?

18:47.466 --> 18:49.694
- Claudia... -We can't
sell the house.

18:49.718 --> 18:52.020
We can't move out. I don't
care about the money.

18:53.096 --> 18:55.607
I'm sorry, but...

18:55.682 --> 18:58.818
I think this is a really,
really bad idea.

18:59.811 --> 19:01.080
Guys...

19:01.104 --> 19:03.323
I don't want to go.

19:04.274 --> 19:06.868
Me either.

19:07.611 --> 19:09.329
None of us do.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.133
You think he's mad at us?

19:22.417 --> 19:24.062
He'll recover.

19:24.086 --> 19:26.096
You say that like it's over.

19:26.296 --> 19:28.640
As far as I'm concerned, it is.

19:28.673 --> 19:30.985
He went to Seattle this
morning, do you know that?

19:31.009 --> 19:32.769
Gwen picked him up early.

19:32.928 --> 19:34.947
- Really?
- You're kidding.

19:34.971 --> 19:37.107
Kirsten said he shaved.

19:37.390 --> 19:39.660
He shaved?

19:39.684 --> 19:41.454
Charlie?

19:41.478 --> 19:44.072
He's going to take
the job, isn't he?

19:44.397 --> 19:47.627
And what if he does?

19:47.651 --> 19:48.628
Maybe it'll be okay.

19:48.652 --> 19:51.089
I mean, maybe everything
would work out okay.

19:51.113 --> 19:53.966
It could, right?

19:53.990 --> 19:55.927
Well, I'm not going.

19:55.951 --> 19:57.553
I mean, it's taken us this long

19:57.577 --> 19:59.347
to get, you know, back on track,

19:59.371 --> 20:00.848
and I'm not starting
from scratch.

20:00.872 --> 20:03.351
God, Justin and I just
started seeing each other.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.685
Oh, that's great, Jule.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.062
Is that all you can think about?

20:06.086 --> 20:07.146
No, that's not what I meant.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.147
God.

20:08.171 --> 20:10.483
Like the whole world revolves
around you and your boyfriend.

20:10.507 --> 20:12.767
Bailey, that is not
what I'm saying.

20:13.218 --> 20:15.145
Just forget it.

20:20.267 --> 20:21.786
So I was thinking,

20:21.810 --> 20:23.830
maybe I did push you
a little too fast.

20:23.854 --> 20:26.249
I mean, it's not so easy
to make such a big change,

20:26.273 --> 20:27.458
just like that.

20:27.482 --> 20:28.793
Forget it, Ross.

20:28.817 --> 20:32.004
No, come on. Listen to me. I
have an idea for a compromise.

20:32.028 --> 20:33.506
If I stayed on as your teacher...

20:33.530 --> 20:34.757
You're not gonna be
my teacher, okay?

20:34.781 --> 20:37.750
No one is, because we're
not gonna be here anymore.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.470
We're moving to Seattle,

20:39.494 --> 20:41.379
so just forget about it.

20:41.454 --> 20:43.631
Seattle?

20:45.208 --> 20:48.678
Charlie got this job offer,
and he's making us go.

20:52.924 --> 20:54.809
Wow.

20:55.427 --> 20:57.604
That's big news.

20:59.681 --> 21:01.774
You want to talk about it?

21:02.058 --> 21:04.370
What's to talk about?

21:04.394 --> 21:07.447
It's not like I have
any say or anything.

21:08.899 --> 21:10.867
Well, you know what
you have to do?

21:10.942 --> 21:12.336
You have to think
about the stuff

21:12.360 --> 21:14.046
that's not going to change,

21:14.070 --> 21:16.080
like you'll still have
your family with you.

21:16.281 --> 21:19.250
Gee, I feel better already.

21:19.868 --> 21:22.471
There's a lot of great
violin teachers up there.

21:22.495 --> 21:24.098
Like I care.

21:24.122 --> 21:25.766
Of course you do.

21:25.790 --> 21:26.976
You're gonna get up there,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.385
and you're still gonna
have your music.

21:30.462 --> 21:32.148
You know, if you concentrate

21:32.172 --> 21:33.399
on the stuff you really love,

21:33.423 --> 21:34.775
it'll make everything
a lot easier.

21:34.799 --> 21:36.194
No, it won't.

21:36.218 --> 21:37.612
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

21:37.636 --> 21:39.530
I'm not playing the
violin anymore.

21:39.554 --> 21:40.656
You don't want to do that.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.949
Yes, I do.

21:41.973 --> 21:43.826
If Charlie makes us move
to Seattle, that's it.

21:43.850 --> 21:46.152
I'm giving up the stupid violin.

21:52.192 --> 21:54.118
So...

21:54.152 --> 21:55.630
How much time do we have left?

21:55.654 --> 21:56.964
Don't.

21:56.988 --> 21:59.749
It's not even definite.

22:01.826 --> 22:04.263
Why don't we run away to
South America together,

22:04.287 --> 22:06.881
change our names to Delrubio
or something like that.

22:07.207 --> 22:08.351
This isn't funny.

22:08.375 --> 22:09.352
I'm serious.

22:09.376 --> 22:12.095
Why don't you come
live with my family?

22:13.588 --> 22:15.932
You think they'd let me?

22:17.634 --> 22:20.937
Sure, why not? I mean,
they worship you.

22:22.305 --> 22:23.616
Jeanie's away at school.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.441
Her room's just
sitting there empty.

22:26.434 --> 22:28.412
And it would only be
for, like, two years.

22:28.436 --> 22:29.789
- I mean...
- Yeah.

22:29.813 --> 22:31.207
Then we could go away
to the same college.

22:31.231 --> 22:32.708
Yeah, and it's not
like we would be

22:32.732 --> 22:34.961
adopting you or anything.

22:34.985 --> 22:36.629
Just think about it. You'd be...

22:36.653 --> 22:38.705
You'd be right down the
hall from me all the time.

22:39.489 --> 22:41.759
We'd sort of be, like,
living together.

22:41.783 --> 22:43.678
Yeah. Follow me.

22:43.702 --> 22:44.971
Why not? Let's ask.

22:44.995 --> 22:46.973
I mean, they invited
us to dinner tonight.

22:46.997 --> 22:49.600
We get a couple of
glasses of wine in them,

22:49.624 --> 22:52.176
and who knows?

22:52.961 --> 22:54.814
Wait'll you see the factory.

22:54.838 --> 22:56.524
It's got this huge window

22:56.548 --> 22:57.608
overlooking the whole operation,

22:57.632 --> 22:59.568
so I'd be able to sit
at my drafting table

22:59.592 --> 23:01.936
and watch my furniture
being made.

23:04.055 --> 23:06.107
I'll have my own secretary.

23:06.391 --> 23:08.035
Me.

23:08.059 --> 23:09.527
It'll be weird.

23:10.228 --> 23:12.530
I'm sure you'll adapt.

23:12.731 --> 23:13.958
Afterwards, we drove around,

23:13.982 --> 23:16.576
checking out neighborhoods,
looking at houses.

23:16.943 --> 23:18.671
We could afford
something pretty nice,

23:18.695 --> 23:20.131
but I was thinking
maybe we should buy,

23:20.155 --> 23:21.257
a real fixer-upper

23:21.281 --> 23:22.341
and do the work ourselves.

23:22.365 --> 23:23.634
I mean, the kids would
love that, right?

23:23.658 --> 23:25.219
It would be fun.

23:25.243 --> 23:26.846
I could build Julia
a canopy bed.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.639
She's always wanted
one of those.

23:28.663 --> 23:31.591
Bay'd be able to play
football next year.

23:33.001 --> 23:34.969
Did anybody say
anything at home?

23:35.378 --> 23:36.679
No.

23:36.713 --> 23:38.848
It's been kind of quiet.

23:39.299 --> 23:40.892
I'm going to talk to them.

23:41.134 --> 23:43.728
I bet you I can sell them
on this, don't you think?

23:44.220 --> 23:46.606
Oh.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.195
For Claud. The Space Needle.

23:55.940 --> 23:58.493
Everyone up there kept calling me "Mr.
Salinger."

23:59.027 --> 24:02.580
I kept looking over my
shoulder for my father.

24:13.124 --> 24:15.102
How was your night?

24:15.126 --> 24:17.220
You have a good time?

24:18.755 --> 24:20.973
I sure as hell hope you did
because you know what?

24:21.049 --> 24:22.818
I'm going to fail
this test tomorrow,

24:22.842 --> 24:24.737
and I really hope that whatever
you were doing tonight

24:24.761 --> 24:26.562
is more important than that.

24:27.305 --> 24:29.273
- You bet.
- Great.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.660
What?

24:31.684 --> 24:34.487
You didn't actually think
I'd be here, did you?

24:34.521 --> 24:36.332
I mean, you don't think
you can call me a bitch

24:36.356 --> 24:38.250
and expect me to rush
home to save your butt.

24:38.274 --> 24:40.711
Right. right. I forgot
that I was talking to Miss

24:40.735 --> 24:43.746
Sensitivity and Understanding.

24:43.863 --> 24:46.050
"You'd have to be brain-dead
not to get this, Bay.

24:46.074 --> 24:48.135
"Bay, God, you're pretty stupid.

24:48.159 --> 24:49.470
"I'd better run out
and be with Justin

24:49.494 --> 24:50.888
because I don't care
what happens to you."

24:50.912 --> 24:53.432
Hey, I was here and
I was helping you

24:53.456 --> 24:56.185
and all I got was you
trashing me and Justin,

24:56.209 --> 24:58.771
like there's something wrong with
me wanting to spend time with him,

24:58.795 --> 25:01.107
like you don't know exactly
what that feels like.

25:01.131 --> 25:02.650
- Forget it.
- No way.

25:02.674 --> 25:05.518
When did this become my
responsibility, huh?

25:05.677 --> 25:07.446
I'm not the one who failed.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.532
I'm not the one who
skipped a week of school

25:09.556 --> 25:10.533
to run off to L.A.

25:10.557 --> 25:13.443
I mean, this is so unfair.

25:13.476 --> 25:15.695
I'm having a great time

25:15.895 --> 25:17.998
for the first time in so long.

25:18.022 --> 25:19.708
I just want to spend
time with Justin,

25:19.732 --> 25:21.451
that's all I want to do,

25:21.526 --> 25:23.170
and now this stuff with Seattle

25:23.194 --> 25:24.839
and having to study with you.

25:24.863 --> 25:27.174
What, so is that a
good reason just to...

25:27.198 --> 25:28.791
to ditch me?

25:29.242 --> 25:31.252
You know what?

25:31.411 --> 25:34.255
You treat me like some
baby with brains,

25:34.664 --> 25:36.934
you know, like there's
something silly and cute

25:36.958 --> 25:38.394
about being in
love with someone.

25:38.418 --> 25:39.728
Why should I help you?

25:39.752 --> 25:41.345
Because I'm in trouble

25:41.629 --> 25:43.723
and I'm your brother.

25:49.971 --> 25:51.814
Hey.

25:56.769 --> 25:59.790
You know what? Why don't I
take your bags upstairs?

25:59.814 --> 26:01.657
Okay.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.332
Where's Claudia? Is she asleep?

26:09.782 --> 26:13.044
Who could possibly
sleep in this house?

26:16.164 --> 26:18.559
I took the job.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.426
They want me in Seattle...

26:20.710 --> 26:22.345
as soon as possible.

26:22.462 --> 26:23.971
What?

26:25.757 --> 26:28.194
So you just do whatever
you want, man?

26:28.218 --> 26:30.436
What is wrong with this family?

26:30.511 --> 26:32.740
Why would you do that to us?

26:32.764 --> 26:35.242
Yeah, we told you we
didn't want to go.

26:35.266 --> 26:37.786
- He doesn't care.
- What are you...

26:37.810 --> 26:40.581
I don't care? Are you kidding?

26:40.605 --> 26:42.791
I'm trying to make this
work out for all of us.

26:42.815 --> 26:44.951
I'm trying to make this okay.

26:50.198 --> 26:51.342
Now...

26:51.366 --> 26:54.178
I talked to some people about
schools, Claud, and guess what?

26:54.202 --> 26:56.764
There's this incredible school

26:56.788 --> 26:58.506
for kids who are good
at music and art.

27:01.668 --> 27:04.011
I thought you'd be
happy about that,

27:04.420 --> 27:07.149
and the airline
has these coupons

27:07.173 --> 27:09.151
for pretty cheap flights
from Seattle back here,

27:09.175 --> 27:10.736
so if you want to
come back and visit,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.279
even, like, every month,

27:12.303 --> 27:13.489
whatever you want, that's fine.

27:13.513 --> 27:14.782
I mean, I'll pay for it.

27:14.806 --> 27:16.566
It's not the same thing.

27:18.518 --> 27:21.070
- I know it's not, but... -I don't
want to go to a different school.

27:21.980 --> 27:23.332
You don't know that.

27:23.356 --> 27:25.324
We'll go visit the place.

27:29.362 --> 27:31.966
This is the first
really great thing

27:31.990 --> 27:33.384
that has ever
happened in my life.

27:33.408 --> 27:34.385
I can't let it go.

27:34.409 --> 27:35.960
You have to understand that.

27:37.370 --> 27:39.046
That's not fair, Charlie.

27:39.289 --> 27:41.684
That is not a fair argument.

27:41.708 --> 27:42.810
I mean, there's one of you

27:42.834 --> 27:44.061
and there are four of us,

27:44.085 --> 27:46.021
and each of us has
something here

27:46.045 --> 27:49.724
that is every bit as important to
us as your business is to you,

27:50.008 --> 27:52.351
and this is our home.

27:55.972 --> 27:57.440
Fine.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.243
Then I'll tell you what,

27:59.267 --> 28:01.537
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

28:01.561 --> 28:04.123
We're moving to Seattle.

28:04.147 --> 28:06.699
- You can't do that.
- The hell I can't!

28:06.899 --> 28:08.877
I'm in charge here.
I'm the adult.

28:08.901 --> 28:10.629
We are picking up
and we are going

28:10.653 --> 28:12.589
and I don't want to hear
another word from any of you.

28:12.613 --> 28:14.049
We are not going with you!

28:14.073 --> 28:15.958
- Yes, you are!
- I'm not going.

28:16.075 --> 28:18.012
I'm moving in with Justin.
We asked his parents

28:18.036 --> 28:19.513
and they said they'd
think about it.

28:19.537 --> 28:21.172
What?

28:24.834 --> 28:26.854
What about me?

28:26.878 --> 28:28.679
Where do I go?

28:30.798 --> 28:32.693
You are all coming with me.

28:32.717 --> 28:34.403
There's no way you can
do that, Charlie, okay?

28:34.427 --> 28:36.447
You can't, so you go.

28:36.471 --> 28:39.450
You go to Seattle and you take care of
yourself. We're not going with you.

28:39.474 --> 28:41.233
We're going to get split up.

28:42.310 --> 28:43.412
That's right.

28:43.436 --> 28:44.663
That's right.

28:44.687 --> 28:47.281
I hope you can live with that.

28:58.159 --> 28:59.845
20 minutes left,

28:59.869 --> 29:02.380
so pace yourselves...

29:05.083 --> 29:06.435
and remember,

29:06.459 --> 29:08.469
I'll be giving partial credit,

29:08.544 --> 29:11.097
so show your work.

29:26.979 --> 29:29.333
Oh, God, everyone's an
idiot when it rains.

29:29.357 --> 29:31.543
I thought I'd never get
out of that Xerox place.

29:31.567 --> 29:32.795
Okay I, uh...

29:32.819 --> 29:34.338
I copied the rough
sketches of the armoires,

29:34.362 --> 29:36.090
and I need ballparks
on the unit cost.

29:36.114 --> 29:37.716
If we can't make them for
under one and a quarter,

29:37.740 --> 29:39.583
I think we should drop the line.

29:40.660 --> 29:41.762
What's the matter?

29:41.786 --> 29:44.130
One and a quarter's the top.
We knew that, Charlie.

29:44.789 --> 29:46.549
They said they won't go.

29:48.251 --> 29:51.929
Bailey and Julia and
Claudia, they...

29:52.171 --> 29:54.390
They don't want to move.

29:55.299 --> 29:57.727
You're kidding, right?

29:59.262 --> 30:01.480
Oh, God.

30:01.556 --> 30:03.232
Wow.

30:05.518 --> 30:07.663
What does that mean, exactly?

30:07.687 --> 30:10.165
I mean, not to sound
insensitive or anything,

30:10.189 --> 30:12.835
but what about you?

30:12.859 --> 30:14.702
I don't know.

30:14.944 --> 30:18.080
I'm kind of trying
to figure that out.

30:19.407 --> 30:21.760
I really want us to
do this together.

30:21.784 --> 30:23.303
I mean, we're a team,
we're partners,

30:23.327 --> 30:25.806
and neither one of us would
even be in this position

30:25.830 --> 30:28.382
if it hadn't been for the other,

30:29.292 --> 30:31.385
but this is big, Charlie,

30:31.919 --> 30:32.980
and if you...

30:33.004 --> 30:34.940
If you can't do this with me...

30:34.964 --> 30:36.275
Hey.

30:36.299 --> 30:38.851
I haven't made up my mind yet.

30:43.055 --> 30:44.658
When I got home,

30:44.682 --> 30:46.609
my mom was at the sink.

30:47.393 --> 30:49.747
And, uh, she didn't
say anything,

30:49.771 --> 30:51.832
but I could tell she was upset.

30:51.856 --> 30:53.208
She was, uh,

30:53.232 --> 30:56.285
washing the lettuce
at 11 o'clock,

30:56.903 --> 30:58.422
so I, uh...

30:58.446 --> 31:00.048
went to the fridge
to get something,

31:00.072 --> 31:02.217
and the next thing I know,

31:02.241 --> 31:04.919
she comes over and puts
her arms around me,

31:05.077 --> 31:08.390
and I'm standing there with
a bottle of orange juice,

31:08.414 --> 31:10.508
and she's just hugging me.

31:15.630 --> 31:18.140
They said no?

31:23.221 --> 31:26.023
She said that she
talked to my dad...

31:26.599 --> 31:28.651
and...

31:28.851 --> 31:31.529
they just thought it was best
if you were with your family.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.545
She seemed to be

31:38.569 --> 31:41.288
sad about it, like she, uh...

31:41.697 --> 31:44.959
she would have liked
to have said yes.

31:46.452 --> 31:48.680
And she loves you,

31:48.704 --> 31:51.507
and she knows that I love you.

31:56.671 --> 31:59.348
So that's it, then.

32:01.259 --> 32:03.894
Okay, well, look,

32:04.554 --> 32:06.198
we'll write each other

32:06.222 --> 32:09.233
and we'll talk on the phone

32:09.684 --> 32:11.829
and airfare isn't that bad

32:11.853 --> 32:13.539
and in the meantime,

32:13.563 --> 32:15.823
we'll spend all our
time together, okay?

32:16.482 --> 32:18.492
Mm-hmm.

32:20.069 --> 32:22.913
Starting tonight.

32:25.366 --> 32:27.501
I can't tonight.

32:29.287 --> 32:31.755
I want to, I swear.
It's just, um...

32:33.249 --> 32:35.060
It's like, everyone in my family

32:35.084 --> 32:37.344
is looking out for
themselves these days.

32:37.962 --> 32:39.388
Me too,

32:40.214 --> 32:41.817
and it feels, uh,

32:41.841 --> 32:43.193
I don't know...

32:43.217 --> 32:45.144
bad,

32:45.720 --> 32:47.605
like we're all
thinking of ourselves.

32:49.307 --> 32:52.443
Doing things for ourselves,
no matter who gets hurt.

32:54.228 --> 32:56.280
Well, I don't get it.

32:56.355 --> 32:59.241
Bailey failed his math
test, and it's my fault,

32:59.525 --> 33:01.785
so I have to do something,

33:02.987 --> 33:04.673
and if I can get
him a makeup test

33:04.697 --> 33:07.333
and help him study tonight,

33:08.784 --> 33:12.046
or talk to him and just
apologize, then, uh...

33:14.373 --> 33:16.091
Well, I kind of have to do it.

33:21.923 --> 33:24.266
How about tomorrow night?

33:24.884 --> 33:27.186
And every night after that.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.701
I was thinking.

33:32.725 --> 33:34.077
Maybe Charlie could take

33:34.101 --> 33:35.579
some of Dad's cooking stuff.

33:35.603 --> 33:37.039
Maybe Justin's folks

33:37.063 --> 33:38.697
will let Julia bring the piano,

33:39.106 --> 33:41.742
and I thought one of
us should take those.

33:43.694 --> 33:45.704
I mean, if we're split up.

33:49.158 --> 33:51.585
Look, Claud,

33:52.328 --> 33:54.588
the truth is...

33:55.748 --> 33:59.093
The truth is, if Charlie
goes, we'll go with him.

33:59.794 --> 34:02.054
Even after what you said to him?

34:02.463 --> 34:04.598
Yeah.

34:06.342 --> 34:08.612
I can't imagine
living anywhere else.

34:08.636 --> 34:10.405
I know.

34:10.429 --> 34:11.822
Me either.

34:11.847 --> 34:13.492
I hear it rains a
lot in Seattle.

34:13.516 --> 34:14.733
Yeah, well,

34:15.810 --> 34:19.612
if we're all up there together,
maybe it won't be so bad.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.018
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, Mr.
Gronemeyer.

34:40.042 --> 34:42.511
but I kind of have to talk
to you about Bailey's test.

34:42.585 --> 34:45.524
You asked me to help him,
and I sort of did, I guess,

34:45.547 --> 34:48.068
but I feel like his grade
is probably my fault,

34:48.092 --> 34:50.112
so I thought I'd ask if
he could make it up.

34:50.136 --> 34:52.239
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Julia.

34:52.263 --> 34:54.533
We've already bent over
backwards for your brother.

34:54.556 --> 34:57.244
Well, I know, but he would have done
better if I'd helped him a little more.

34:57.268 --> 34:58.902
You did what you could.

34:59.103 --> 35:01.071
He'll just have to
live with a B-minus.

35:02.189 --> 35:04.710
B-minus? Okay.

35:04.734 --> 35:07.286
I just thought I'd ask.

35:10.156 --> 35:12.374
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:12.825 --> 35:14.136
Do you mind if I, uh...

35:14.160 --> 35:15.137
It's okay.

35:15.161 --> 35:17.463
It's a very slow read.

35:19.415 --> 35:20.434
Cap'n Crunch?

35:20.458 --> 35:22.102
Thanks.

35:22.126 --> 35:24.271
Sorry. I ate all the
Crunch Berries.

35:24.295 --> 35:25.355
That's okay.

35:25.379 --> 35:27.598
I kind of like the way
it sticks to my teeth.

35:28.632 --> 35:30.768
Charlie signed all
his contracts.

35:33.637 --> 35:34.980
We're definitely going to go.

35:35.056 --> 35:36.273
Oh, yeah?

35:37.141 --> 35:38.326
How soon, do you think?

35:38.350 --> 35:40.652
A couple of months, I guess.

35:40.978 --> 35:43.280
We've got to sell
the house first.

35:46.734 --> 35:49.087
So I'll still be
around for a while.

35:49.111 --> 35:50.589
Well, I'll definitely see you.

35:50.613 --> 35:53.540
We can have lunch and stuff.

35:53.699 --> 35:54.801
Is that it?

35:54.825 --> 35:56.053
Well,

35:56.077 --> 35:59.556
what else do you want, Claud? I mean,
if you're giving up the violin.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.590
I don't know, Ross.

36:06.212 --> 36:08.472
It's kind of screwed up.

36:09.590 --> 36:10.734
I mean,

36:10.758 --> 36:13.435
maybe I will be a great
violinist some day,

36:13.469 --> 36:17.564
if I don't get, like, run
over by a bus or something,

36:17.598 --> 36:20.275
but maybe I won't.

36:20.893 --> 36:22.954
Right now, I just want
to be a regular kid,

36:22.978 --> 36:24.988
who happens to be pretty
good on the violin,

36:25.481 --> 36:26.500
a kid who takes lessons

36:26.524 --> 36:28.293
from someone she really likes,

36:28.317 --> 36:30.619
because that's the part
that makes me happy.

36:32.571 --> 36:34.706
And that's...

36:35.324 --> 36:37.251
That's sort of what
I need right now.

36:39.662 --> 36:41.630
At least until I go.

36:44.291 --> 36:46.552
Three o'clock?

36:47.044 --> 36:49.388
As usual?

36:50.256 --> 36:53.350
Maybe we could try the
Bach <i>Double in D Minor?</i>

36:53.384 --> 36:55.195
Well, I don't know.

36:55.219 --> 36:57.396
That's a pretty advanced piece.

36:57.429 --> 36:59.241
Don't worry.

36:59.265 --> 37:01.024
I'll take the hard part.

37:02.143 --> 37:03.819
You know what?

37:04.019 --> 37:07.197
If I were a father, if
I were their father,

37:07.273 --> 37:09.751
and my company wanted
to transfer me,

37:09.775 --> 37:12.379
or if I just got some
amazing job offer,

37:12.403 --> 37:14.339
I'd just come home and
say, "Guess what?"

37:14.363 --> 37:15.956
and we'd go.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.510
I mean, sure, there'd be
some bitching and moaning,

37:18.534 --> 37:20.169
but we'd go.

37:20.494 --> 37:22.347
I mean, that happens
all the time,

37:22.371 --> 37:23.473
and that's the way it happens.

37:23.497 --> 37:25.507
Families follow the dad.

37:28.169 --> 37:30.095
And I'm kind of the dad.

37:32.131 --> 37:34.558
And I'm kind of not.

37:35.467 --> 37:37.478
The thing is, I...

37:50.733 --> 37:52.826
I built those.

37:54.361 --> 37:57.956
And someone liked them
enough to spend $650.

38:02.536 --> 38:05.005
That means something.

38:07.833 --> 38:10.344
It does.

38:15.799 --> 38:17.777
It's okay, Owen. I'll turn
the volume down really low

38:17.801 --> 38:19.279
so it doesn't damage
your hearing,

38:19.303 --> 38:21.271
but I really need you
to be quiet, okay?

38:21.722 --> 38:24.233
It's Pearl Jam, so you'll
grow up with good taste.

38:36.070 --> 38:38.673
I just wanted to
congratulate you...

38:38.697 --> 38:40.499
on the test and all.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.794
Thanks.

38:43.953 --> 38:44.971
How'd you know?

38:44.995 --> 38:47.474
I went to see Gronemeyer to
ask him to give you a makeup

38:47.498 --> 38:48.715
and he told me.

38:48.749 --> 38:51.019
So anyways, that's great.

38:51.043 --> 38:53.053
You asked Gronemeyer
to give me a makeup?

38:54.964 --> 38:55.982
Guilt...

38:56.006 --> 38:57.567
you know?

38:57.591 --> 39:00.477
But the point is, you
really didn't need my help,

39:00.719 --> 39:03.397
which is probably a good
thing, considering.

39:03.931 --> 39:06.233
No kidding.

39:17.653 --> 39:19.746
I'm sorry.

39:20.155 --> 39:21.800
Yeah.

39:21.824 --> 39:23.542
Well, me too.

39:26.704 --> 39:28.547
I don't know. It's just...

39:29.915 --> 39:32.269
It's like, here I am, trying
to keep from drowning,

39:32.293 --> 39:34.271
and I keep being reminded

39:34.295 --> 39:36.263
of how easy it's been for you.

39:36.797 --> 39:38.775
It hasn't been that easy.

39:38.799 --> 39:40.517
Well, at least you have Justin.

39:43.470 --> 39:45.314
I guess.

39:46.557 --> 39:48.066
You're happy, Jule.

39:48.809 --> 39:49.995
There's nothing wrong with that.

39:50.019 --> 39:51.695
I'm just jealous.

39:52.855 --> 39:54.656
And...

39:56.775 --> 39:58.169
And I don't mean
to make it sound

39:58.193 --> 40:01.673
like what you guys have
is silly or stupid.

40:01.697 --> 40:03.633
It's not silly or stupid.

40:03.657 --> 40:05.208
It's...

40:06.952 --> 40:08.462
It's simple.

40:10.664 --> 40:13.425
And I guess I just wish that...

40:14.293 --> 40:17.137
That things could have
been that way with Jill.

40:19.673 --> 40:22.225
I don't know, maybe...

40:22.509 --> 40:25.062
Maybe they still can.

40:25.179 --> 40:27.022
Do you think?

40:27.556 --> 40:29.608
Definitely.

40:36.940 --> 40:38.950
Justin's parents said no.

40:40.235 --> 40:42.454
Really?

40:50.746 --> 40:52.390
So...

40:52.414 --> 40:54.392
Seattle.

40:54.416 --> 40:55.643
Yeah.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.594
Seattle.

41:02.132 --> 41:05.227
It's kind of funny,
don't you think?

41:05.803 --> 41:08.897
How you can't hold
on to anything?

41:18.023 --> 41:20.951
We have to remember to be
good to each other, okay?

41:23.195 --> 41:25.747
That's important.

41:26.782 --> 41:29.876
We've got to remind
each other, okay?

41:32.788 --> 41:35.048
Okay?

41:37.292 --> 41:39.052
Okay.

41:51.014 --> 41:53.525
I saw the light on.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.578
Pretty late.

41:55.602 --> 41:58.071
I know.

41:58.188 --> 41:59.531
I was just...

42:01.650 --> 42:04.494
I was just putting
some stuff away.

42:04.820 --> 42:06.214
Listen, Charlie,

42:06.238 --> 42:08.133
about Seattle and all...

42:08.157 --> 42:09.634
Forget it, Claud.

42:09.658 --> 42:10.969
I'm, uh...

42:10.993 --> 42:13.170
I'm not going.

42:14.955 --> 42:16.465
You're not?

42:18.792 --> 42:19.727
But you said that...

42:19.751 --> 42:21.354
I told Gwen I couldn't,

42:21.378 --> 42:23.680
and, uh...

42:24.256 --> 42:26.308
she bought me out.

42:33.682 --> 42:36.109
It's a little over
$15,000, with profit.

42:38.645 --> 42:40.864
Not much, but...

42:42.232 --> 42:44.034
It's a done deal.

42:48.113 --> 42:49.581
I'm sorry.

42:52.493 --> 42:54.628
I really am.

43:00.542 --> 43:02.219
I love you, Charlie.
