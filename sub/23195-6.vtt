00:48.066 --> 00:50.092

scone zoners. It's time for a PWN ZWN brunch break

00:50.092 --> 00:53.081
Brought to you by Brunchables, Brunch Crunch Cereal.

00:53.081 --> 00:57.005

00:59.010 --> 01:02.071
Our top story, crunch when Brian D's underdog dreams

01:02.071 --> 01:06.066
as the one shot wonder of VGHS was completely o'bruncherated

01:06.066 --> 01:09.073
in yesterday's FPS scrimmage by The Law.

01:09.073 --> 01:15.030
Peep this replay of him going eggs, "Benedict Arnold" on teammate Jenny Matrix.

01:30.033 --> 01:36.083
Brian, check it. Ki invented a brunch of
pizza. She calls it, get this, a "quiche".

01:36.083 --> 01:39.016
I already told you, it's just a coincidence!

01:39.016 --> 01:41.043
Isn't she amazing, dude?

01:41.043 --> 01:46.050
You guys are great together.  You would never betray one another.

01:46.050 --> 01:51.056
Oh, man, I suck. You're still beating up over that Jenny Matrix thing?

01:51.056 --> 01:54.032
Nah I'm over it.

01:54.034 --> 01:58.046
That's the 'tude, dude. It's a new day. Carpe Diem.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.063
Carpe Diem.

02:03.066 --> 02:05.068
Carpe Diem.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.020
Let's get to class.

02:17.035 --> 02:21.054
That last run felt a little half baked shot bot but one thing's for sure,

02:21.054 --> 02:27.087
any way you slice this melon, Brian D's chances of making JV at tryouts are over, easy.

02:27.087 --> 02:31.086
I'm Scott Slanders, and I'm drun...

02:48.023 --> 02:52.014
Ki, that's...a 4000 hit combo

02:57.044 --> 03:00.019
I helped my parents design this game.

03:00.076 --> 03:01.081
Let's play again.

03:01.081 --> 03:04.030
No no no! I've had..I've had quite enough.

03:04.030 --> 03:07.084
You already made me quite the Brian D.

03:10.072 --> 03:12.093
Let's play again.

03:16.003 --> 03:23.024
Brian D? More like Brian Z. The last letter in the alphabet. Ooo yeah!

03:23.024 --> 03:25.060
Don't even listen to him dude.

03:25.060 --> 03:29.052
Ted, please, I don't even..know what that means.

03:29.052 --> 03:34.023
Well Z is the la... You know I don't even have time to explain to you how sick of a burn...

03:39.067 --> 03:43.018
Ted? Ted!

03:43.018 --> 03:44.046
What happened?

03:44.046 --> 03:46.096
You okay? You passed out for like 27 minutes!

03:46.096 --> 03:50.033
I'm fine. I just...

03:50.033 --> 03:52.066
You've seen them haven't you Theodore?

03:52.067 --> 03:54.086
Hi Drift King.

03:54.086 --> 03:57.016
The visions. What are they?

03:57.016 --> 04:02.031
Merely a side effect...of drift fever!

04:02.031 --> 04:05.040
You've got the blood Ted! You can't escape this now!

04:05.040 --> 04:11.031
Cast off that silly little plastic guitar, and grip the steering wheel of destiny!

04:11.031 --> 04:14.056
Forget it DK. Us Wongs are bred to shred.

04:14.056 --> 04:16.098
I'm signing up for rythm gaming and there's nothing you can do to stop me!

04:16.098 --> 04:22.007
Confound it!  Why must you Brian D your future way on this dying sport?

04:22.007 --> 04:24.061
Look at me in the eye.

04:24.061 --> 04:32.012
Tell me how hammer-ons and pull-ups can possibly compare to the G force pull of an A+J turn?

04:33.006 --> 04:37.092
The thrum of a rumble chair as you careen past the checkered flag...

04:37.092 --> 04:43.045
The churning in your chest, as you hear those three magical words:

04:43.045 --> 04:48.041
NEW-LAP-RECORD.

04:51.033 --> 04:54.030
Got.. a class, I gotta go to class. Yoga class, let's go!

04:54.030 --> 04:57.011
That's on thursday.
I don't care. Let's go.

04:57.013 --> 04:59.094
Okay!

04:59.094 --> 05:05.016
Ted, even a man as fast as you can't run away from himself forever!

05:07.033 --> 05:09.058
Hey buddy, look, I got you ...uh.

05:09.058 --> 05:15.027
Ah, my thanks ted's vassal. Though in the future, I prefer, sour cream and onions.

05:15.027 --> 05:17.090
Who are you?

05:44.051 --> 05:46.097
Hey there champ. How are you holding up?

05:46.097 --> 05:50.056
Great, great, yeah totally great.

05:50.056 --> 05:54.061
Yeah, this is nothing compared to our old school, those old guys really knew how to haze.

05:54.061 --> 05:59.071
Really? Well, I guess we'll just have to step it up a notch then.

05:59.071 --> 06:03.037
JK, I'm just rattling you, bro!

06:04.091 --> 06:07.020
So...you good?

06:07.020 --> 06:12.066
Good? Yeah, No, I'm great, you know, it's totally great.

06:12.066 --> 06:16.018
You're great, I'm great, you're with the Law, that's great, by the way.

06:16.018 --> 06:22.042
I'm by myself, that's great. Yeah, no, everything is great.

06:22.047 --> 06:28.066
Good. I have to go set up a practice but...I'm glad that you're...

06:28.066 --> 06:31.014
...doing great!

06:33.073 --> 06:36.071
I'll catch you later babe.

06:38.086 --> 06:40.019
I really am d..

06:44.016 --> 06:47.039
Brian D! My office, now!

06:52.010 --> 06:55.074
The school took a risk on you Brian.

06:55.074 --> 07:00.047
You let us down. Have a seat, kid.

07:02.020 --> 07:08.026
Sir. Sir, I know I screwed up at scrimmage, but I figured with try-outs still right around the corner

07:08.027 --> 07:12.004
VGHS try-outs are streamed across the world.

07:12.004 --> 07:14.029
And you're one point away from expulsion.

07:14.029 --> 07:16.098
Administration doesn't like those odds.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.061
So what are you saying?

07:20.061 --> 07:23.012
I'm saying you're circling the drain

07:23.012 --> 07:26.053
We don't need some kid Brian D-ing all over our reputation.

07:26.053 --> 07:31.085
That new catchphrase is the exact reason why administration is asking you to ragequit on your own accord.

07:34.001 --> 07:39.089
We're asking you to - that's a good coffee - we're asking you...

07:39.092 --> 07:42.022
to leave VGHS.

07:52.065 --> 07:54.074
Hey! Kick back the hover ball!

08:25.090 --> 08:27.088
Tough day Brian?

08:28.071 --> 08:31.077
Oh hey Games! What do you want?

08:31.077 --> 08:34.091
Just wondered if you dropped this.

08:34.091 --> 08:36.087
How did you get that?

08:36.090 --> 08:38.059
Well it's a funny story.

08:38.061 --> 08:43.072
I told you. Stick to Games. I'm totally a catch.

08:43.072 --> 08:46.004
That's my favorite game!

08:46.004 --> 08:50.044
No baby. That's our favorite game.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.039
Great. Well, enjoy the game.

08:57.039 --> 09:00.076
Oh I will. But not as much as Jenny will enjoy your cute little:

09:00.076 --> 09:06.026
Oh, I like you but I don't have the balls to say so note.Well per chance the Law will succomb to your...

09:06.026 --> 09:09.010
..."Don Juan" thing marksmanship.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.030
Are you kidding me?

09:12.030 --> 09:13.015
This place is ridiculous!

09:13.015 --> 09:18.047
It's my time in the spotlight Brian! And you're standing in my way.

09:18.047 --> 09:19.096
It's Game's time.

09:19.096 --> 09:27.046
Wow! It's Game's time! That's cute. You got yourself a little brand. I like that.

09:27.052 --> 09:30.033
You know what Games? You want the spotlight?

09:30.033 --> 09:33.017
You can have it! But first here's what we're gonna do.

09:33.017 --> 09:36.007
We're going to throw it down.I'm gonna stomp your face.

09:36.007 --> 09:41.058
I'm gonna make you cry, in front of your two...stupid friends whose names I don't even wanna know.

09:41.059 --> 09:45.067
You see Games, I'm one point away from expulsion.

09:46.091 --> 09:49.087
And I'm gonna use that point on all 3 of you noobs.

09:49.087 --> 09:52.073
I figured you'd say something like that.

09:55.064 --> 09:59.001
Assault rifles?
Oh, let's get an SMG in there.

09:59.001 --> 10:01.014
You funeral. Best at three?

10:01.014 --> 10:03.055
First to five!
Games on.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.042
See ya!

11:01.093 --> 11:04.042
I'm destroying you!

11:19.077 --> 11:22.083
What are you doing here?
Saving your ass.

11:27.028 --> 11:32.046
Yeah, well, it's a little late.

11:45.013 --> 11:49.017
Dammit Brian, what the hell are you doing?

11:49.017 --> 11:50.057
I'm leaving on my own accord.

11:50.057 --> 11:55.049
Yeah, I set you up. But you know what? You wanted to be in that game, and you screwed it up.

11:55.049 --> 11:58.013
So you can blame me, you can blame the whole damn school.

11:58.013 --> 12:04.099
But right here, right now, it is all on you.

12:11.042 --> 12:13.028
Let's dance.

13:23.042 --> 13:28.080
But...but it was Games' time!

13:28.080 --> 13:33.049
This isn't over Brian D. Crownies ? Let's roll.

13:39.070 --> 13:42.003
Thanks for the assist.

13:42.003 --> 13:48.098
Yeah, you're welcome. You should play like that more often.

13:52.078 --> 13:56.057
See you at sign-ups tomorrow.

13:56.057 --> 14:01.048
You can kiss your high scores, good bye!

14:01.049 --> 14:05.022
Yeah, good luck with that captain.

14:06.098 --> 14:09.046
Hey Jenny, thanks for giving me a shot.

14:09.046 --> 14:15.053
No matter how cool your are, better practice those 5-star songs if you plan on taking me on. Brian.
