01:10.111 --> 01:11.695
Mary: NOW, WHAT WAS
THE TERRITORY CALLED

01:11.863 --> 01:13.781
THAT LEWIS AND CLARK
WERE TO EXPLORE?

01:13.948 --> 01:15.532
Children: LOUISIANA.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.825
Mary: WHAT WAS THE YEAR?

01:16.993 --> 01:19.536
[CHILDREN SAYING
DIFFERENT YEARS]

01:19.704 --> 01:20.746
WHO SAID 1803?

01:20.914 --> 01:21.789
Girl: I DID.

01:21.956 --> 01:22.790
SUSAN?

01:22.957 --> 01:23.916
YES, MA'AM.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.417
ALL RIGHT, SUSAN.
THAT'S CORRECT.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.294
DO YOU ALSO REMEMBER
WHO WAS PRESIDENT?

01:27.462 --> 01:28.420
THOMAS JEFFERSON.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.713
YES.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.757
NOW, THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY,
STRETCHING WEST

01:31.925 --> 01:34.551
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
TO THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE,

01:34.719 --> 01:37.721
WAS EQUALLY AS LARGE
AS ALL OF THE UNITED STATES
PUT TOGETHER,

01:37.889 --> 01:41.058
AND, WELL,
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE
ANYBODY KNEW ABOUT IT.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.227
PRESIDENT JEFFERSON HAD--

01:56.908 --> 01:59.159
PRESIDENT JEFFERSON
HAD 2 MAJOR PROBLEMS

01:59.327 --> 02:00.953
IN LAUNCHING THE EXPEDITION.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.705
ONE WAS THAT THE TERRITORY WAS
STILL LEGALLY OWNED BY FRANCE,

02:03.873 --> 02:07.167
SO IT MUST NOT HAVE THE LOOK
OF A MILITARY OPERATION.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.004
Susan:
MRS. KENDALL?

02:11.172 --> 02:12.840
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

02:14.592 --> 02:17.052
NO. NO, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.973
WE'LL CONTINUE TOMORROW.
PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.100
CLASS DISMISSED.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.828
MRS. KENDALL?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.122
OH. YES.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.293
THERE IS SOMETHING
WRONG, ISN'T THERE?

02:49.460 --> 02:52.963
OH...JUST A LITTLE
DIZZINESS, THAT'S ALL.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.798
I--I'LL BE FINE.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.133
ARE YOU SURE?

02:56.301 --> 02:57.134
I'M SURE.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.510
YOU GO ALONG, NOW.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.053
YES, MA'AM.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.551
MY KNOWLEDGE
IN THIS FIELD
IS VERY LIMITED,

03:39.719 --> 03:41.303
BUT
I MUST ADMIT,

03:41.471 --> 03:43.555
THERE ARE SIGNS.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.265
Laura: I KNOW IT'S TRUE.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.184
I NEVER BELIEVED THAT
YOU WOULD STAY BLIND,

03:47.352 --> 03:48.685
NO MATTER
WHAT ANYBODY SAID.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.188
Mary: ADAM, DO YOU
REALIZE WHAT THIS WILL MEAN?

03:51.356 --> 03:53.649
ADAM, WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE
AT THE SCHOOL ANYMORE.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.525
WE COULD GET A HOUSE
OF OUR OWN--

03:55.693 --> 03:58.195
MARY, I HOPE
TO GOD IT'S TRUE,

03:58.363 --> 04:00.239
BUT YOU'VE ALL
GOT TO BE PREPARED
FOR THE FACT

04:00.406 --> 04:02.741
THAT THERE COULD BE
ANOTHER EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.743
Laura: WELL,
HOW COULD THERE BE?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.703
SEEING LIGHT
IS STILL SEEING.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.247
Mary: WATCH.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.130
THIS IS WHEN
IT'S STRONGEST.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.175
I CAN SEE THE LIGHT

04:20.343 --> 04:23.095
FOR AS LONG
AS I STAND HERE.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.805
IT'S SO BRIGHT!

04:24.973 --> 04:28.225
IT'S THE BRIGHTEST LIGHT
I'VE EVER SEEN.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.310
IT'S A MIRACLE.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.187
OH, MARY.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.649
OHH...

04:35.817 --> 04:37.484
IT'S A MIRACLE.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.573
THE NEXT THING IS
TO GET TO DR. BURKE
IN MANKATO.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.575
HE'LL BE
ABLE TO GIVE YOU
A DEFINITE ANSWER.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.661
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'LL LEAVE
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.913
Laura: YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
AGAIN, MARY.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.957
I KNOWYOU ARE.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.207
ADAM?

05:35.960 --> 05:38.211
I'M RIGHT HERE.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.423
CAN'T SLEEP?

05:43.301 --> 05:46.762
NO. UH...I GUESS
I'M TOO EXCITED.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.388
I KNOW.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.979
ADAM, COME HERE.

06:07.158 --> 06:11.453
TO THINK OF BEING ABLE
TO SEE YOUR FACE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.288
YOU MIGHT BE
DISAPPOINTED.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.706
VERY FUNNY.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.835
I MEAN, I...
I CAN SEE IT NOW, BUT...

06:19.003 --> 06:21.129
TO REALLY SEE IT...

06:23.591 --> 06:25.425
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.928
I LOVE YOU.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.055
WE'RE GOING
TO BE HAPPY...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.849
HAPPIER THAN
WE'VE EVER BEEN.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.393
YEAH.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.984
Mary: IT'S A SUNNY DAY,
ISN'T IT, PA?

06:43.152 --> 06:45.237
IT SURE IS, DARLING.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.988
I CAN SEE THE LIGHT.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.949
IT'S BRIGHT SOMETIMES.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.659
I WONDER WHERE I'LL BE

06:50.827 --> 06:52.536
WHEN MY SIGHT
REALLY COMES BACK.

06:52.703 --> 06:53.912
HEY, NOW,
REMEMBER OUR DEAL.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.205
WE DON'T SAY WHEN,
WE SAY IF,

06:55.373 --> 06:57.374
TILL WE HEAR DIFFERENT
FROM DR. BURKE.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.459
I KNOW,
BUT I'M SO SURE.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.002
OUR DEAL?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.046
ALL RIGHT.
IF MY SIGHT COMES BACK,

07:03.214 --> 07:04.631
I WONDER WHERE I'LL BE.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.842
I WONDER WHAT THE FIRST
THING I SEE WILL BE.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.428
WELL, ADAM,
I'D IMAGINE.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.388
BUT WHAT IF
I'M NOT...I MEAN,

07:11.556 --> 07:14.141
WHAT IF I'M ALL BY
MYSELF, NOT WITH HIM
OR THE FAMILY,

07:14.308 --> 07:15.809
THE PEOPLE I MOST
WANT TO SEE?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.061
I IMAGINE ALL THE
WHOOPING AND HOLLERING
YOU'LL BE DOING

07:18.229 --> 07:19.729
WILL BRING
EVERYBODY RUNNING.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.314
OH, I CAN'T WAIT.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.150
SO MANY THINGS
TO SEE--

07:23.317 --> 07:25.986
THE SKY, TREES...

07:26.154 --> 07:30.240
THE SNOW. HOW I LOVE
TO WATCH THE SNOW FALL.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.075
I CAN GUARANTEE
YOU THE SKY,

07:32.243 --> 07:34.494
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THE SNOW.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.581
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
ONCE WHEN I WAS LITTLE--

07:37.748 --> 07:39.249
IT WAS IN THE SUMMER,

07:39.417 --> 07:41.793
AND WE WERE
VISITING GRANDPA.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.755
HE HAD THIS...
THIS LITTLE GLASS GLOBE.

07:45.923 --> 07:48.133
IT WAS FILLED
WITH WATER,

07:48.301 --> 07:51.011
AND THERE WAS A TINY
VILLAGE SCENE INSIDE IT.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.596
WHEN YOU TURNED IT OVER,

07:52.763 --> 07:54.639
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS
SNOWING INSIDE.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.475
I LOVED IT.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.518
YES, I REMEMBER, AND I
REMEMBER YOU BROKE IT,

07:58.686 --> 08:01.688
TOOK THE SNOW OUT OF IT,
AND TRIED TO MAKE A SNOWBALL.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.398
WELL, I DON'T
REMEMBER THAT.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.151
CHILDREN DON'T
GENERALLY REMEMBER THE
BAD THINGS THEY DO.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.653
IS THAT WHY YOU
KEPT TELLING US

08:08.821 --> 08:10.739
WHAT A GOOD LITTLE
BOY YOU WERE?

08:10.907 --> 08:12.240
HA HA! MOST LIKELY.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.408
Hester-Sue: ALL RIGHT.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.369
I WANT YOU TO GO WASH
FOR MEALTIME,

08:16.537 --> 08:19.456
AND DO A GOOD JOB BECAUSE
I'M GOING TO BE CHECKING

08:19.624 --> 08:21.500
FINGERNAILS AND ALL,
ALL RIGHT?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.585
Children: YES, MA'AM.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.464
OH, HELLO,
CAROLINE.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.090
GOOD MORNING,
HESTER-SUE.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.176
WELL, SHE'S
ON HER WAY.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.344
YES.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.262
A LITTLE
NERVOUS, HUH?

08:34.430 --> 08:35.305
TERRIBLY.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.141
SHE'S IN
THE LORD'S HANDS.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.101
I KNOW.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.354
I, UH, STOPPED BY.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.023
I THOUGHT WITH MARY GONE
THAT YOU AND ADAM MIGHT
NEED A HAND.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.274
I APPRECIATE THAT,

08:46.442 --> 08:49.819
BUT ADAM AND I
CAN HANDLE THINGS
JUST FINE.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.363
IS ADAM HERE?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.406
OH, YES.
HE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.450
WE'RE SHARING
COOKING DUTIES,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.619
AND I DON'T EVEN
LIKE TO GO IN A KITCHEN

08:57.787 --> 08:58.995
WHEN A MAN IS THERE.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.414
HA HA! I'LL GIVE YOU
A FULL REPORT.

09:01.582 --> 09:02.916
GOOD.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.587
HI.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.089
HOW'S THE COOK
DOING?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.007
OH, ALL RIGHT, I SUPPOSE.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.010
WELL, I STOPPED
BY TO SEE IF
I COULD HELP,

09:14.178 --> 09:16.513
BUT HESTER-SUE
SAID THAT YOU
COULD MANAGE.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.681
OH, WE CAN.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.182
THANKS ANYWAY.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.477
HOW WAS MARY
THIS MORNING?

09:22.645 --> 09:23.687
EXCITED.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.231
I GUESS WE CAN'T
BLAME HER.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.816
NO, I GUESS NOT.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.442
[THUD]

09:31.237 --> 09:33.321
UH, LET ME GIVE YOU
A HAND WITH THIS.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.157
NO. I CAN MANAGE
BY MYSELF!

09:40.246 --> 09:41.663
SORRY.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.544
I GUESS IT'S JUST
ALL THE EXCITEMENT

09:47.712 --> 09:50.046
AND MARY GOING AWAY
AND ALL.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.008
I'M SORRY.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.803
I UNDERSTAND.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.765
MEN ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE
A MESS IN THE KITCHEN
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.185
YOU SURE
I CAN'T HELP?

10:04.353 --> 10:06.146
YEAH, I'M SURE.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.652
WELL, I GUESS I'LL
BE ON MY WAY, THEN.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.237
HAVE A NICE DAY.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.989
YOU, TOO.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.420
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE
BEEN THINKING?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.797
HOW WOULD I KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.591
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU!

10:34.759 --> 10:36.593
WELL,
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME

10:36.761 --> 10:39.095
INSTEAD OF ASKING ME
A SILLY QUESTION
LIKE THAT?

10:39.263 --> 10:42.140
WELL, IF YOU'D HOLD
STILL FOR A MINUTE,
I'D TELL YOU.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.308
[SIGHS]

10:43.476 --> 10:45.018
ALL RIGHT. GO.

10:45.186 --> 10:50.106
WELL, I WAS THINKING
THAT MARY AND ADAM WILL
WANT A PLACE OF THEIR OWN.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.149
SO?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.942
HOW ABOUT THE OLD
EDWARDS PLACE?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.236
IT'S PRACTICALLY
FALLING DOWN.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.863
WE COULD FIX IT UP.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.741
AND IT'S SO CLOSE
TO THE BLIND SCHOOL,
IT WILL BE PERFECT.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.702
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO WAIT

11:02.870 --> 11:04.788
TILL MARY SEES
THE DOCTOR FIRST?

11:04.955 --> 11:06.623
NO. SHE'LL
BE FINE AGAIN,

11:06.791 --> 11:08.958
AND MAYBE IF WE
FIX IT UP REAL QUICK,

11:09.126 --> 11:11.086
WE CAN SURPRISE HER
WHEN SHE COMES HOME.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.671
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:14.256 --> 11:15.465
LET'S DO IT.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.468
GOOD. I'LL GO TELL CARRIE
TO TAKE CARE OF GRACE.

11:18.636 --> 11:19.928
OK.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.827
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:43.994 --> 11:45.787
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.330
NOT MUCH.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.332
LOOK AT THE ROOF.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.875
SO?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.212
YOU'D HAVE TO KNOW
HOW TO SWIM TO LIVE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.589
WE COULD COVER IT
WITH SOD.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.967
YEAH. I GUESS.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.100

THIS PLACE NEEDS?

A GOOD, STRONG WIND.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.187

12:11.355 --> 12:13.064
IT NEEDS PAINT,

12:13.232 --> 12:14.566

12:14.734 --> 12:17.986
YEAH. THAT SHOULD
BE THE DIFFERENCE...

12:18.154 --> 12:19.404
BUT PAINT
COSTS MONEY,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.907
AND MONEY'S AWFUL
SCARCE RIGHT NOW.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.034

HAVE ME BACK

THINK THERE
WAS A GOOD REASON.

KNOW WE'LL BE HERE

MAKE SURE YOU
TELL HER THINGS
LOOK GOOD.

42:52.444 --> 42:53.695
WHAT?

42:53.862 --> 42:55.905
COME ON!
WHO WOULD YOU PICK?!

42:56.073 --> 42:57.991
WOULD YOU PICK YOU
OR ADAM?!

42:58.158 --> 43:00.451
I...I...

43:00.619 --> 43:03.663
OH, COME ON, MARY,
YOU'D PICK YOURSELF,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

43:03.831 --> 43:06.541
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE
DOING IT FOR ADAM.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.711
I MEAN, IN THE NAME OF GOD,
JUST SAY IT ONE TIME:

43:09.878 --> 43:12.714
"I WANTED TO SEE AGAIN
FOR ME."

43:15.634 --> 43:18.970
JUST SAY IT: "I WANTED
TO SEE AGAIN FOR ME."

43:22.391 --> 43:29.689
I WANTED TO SEE
AGAIN FOR ME.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.569
BABY...

43:34.737 --> 43:36.571
OH, MARY...

43:55.341 --> 43:57.425
Albert: EVERYBODY,
THEY'RE HERE!

43:57.593 --> 43:59.427
COME ON!
THEY'RE HERE!

44:02.598 --> 44:04.307
CAROLINE!

44:06.101 --> 44:07.268
Caroline: MARY.

44:07.436 --> 44:08.770
Mary: MA.

44:08.937 --> 44:11.022
ONE MORE STEP.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.107
OH...

44:13.275 --> 44:14.692
OH, YOU'RE HOME.

44:14.860 --> 44:15.943
OH, MA.

44:16.111 --> 44:17.320
Hester-Sue:
WELCOME HOME, MARY.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.613
OH, THANK YOU.
HI, MARY.

44:18.781 --> 44:20.698
HI, ALBERT.
ADAM?

44:20.866 --> 44:22.742
I'M RIGHT HERE.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.579
OOH!

44:26.747 --> 44:28.289
WELCOME HOME,
DARLING.

44:28.457 --> 44:30.667
IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE HOME.

44:32.878 --> 44:36.839
I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW
THERE'S NO NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

44:37.007 --> 44:40.009
I'M NO WORSE OFF NOW
THAN I WAS BEFORE I LEFT.

44:40.177 --> 44:41.719
NO BETTER,
BUT NO WORSE.

44:41.887 --> 44:44.681
Mary: MA, WHERE'S LAURA?
I BROUGHT HER SOMETHING.

44:44.848 --> 44:48.267
SHE TOOK THE NEWS
SO HARD, SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE HERE.

44:48.435 --> 44:51.479
I'M PRETTY
SURE I KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

44:51.647 --> 44:52.897
WILL YOU
TAKE ME?

44:53.065 --> 44:54.065
SURE.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.441
YOU WANT ME
TO COME WITH YOU?

44:55.609 --> 44:57.485
NO. YOU BEST GET BACK
TO YOUR STUDENTS, HUSBAND.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.028
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
I'VE BEEN GONE.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.239
YOU MEN WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
SISTER TALK, ANYWAY.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.407
OH.

45:02.574 --> 45:03.908
THIS WAY.

45:07.746 --> 45:10.748
SHE'S A STRONG
YOUNG LADY.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.210
THANK YOU.

45:26.306 --> 45:27.640
MARY!

45:30.394 --> 45:33.062
HEY, NOW...
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

45:33.230 --> 45:36.816
I WAS JUST SO SURE
OF IT, THAT'S ALL.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.985
I KNOW.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.195
I WAS, TOO.

45:41.363 --> 45:42.655
IT'S A GOOD LESSON:

45:42.823 --> 45:45.783
DON'T EVER COUNT ON ANYTHING
UNTIL YOU KNOW FOR SURE.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.953
I JUST COULDN'T
DO THAT.

45:49.121 --> 45:52.290
I WANTED YOU
TO SEE SO BAD.

45:52.458 --> 45:56.669
I WANTED YOU TO BE ABLE
TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT
YOU ALWAYS PLANNED TO DO.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.339
ALL RIGHT, NOW!
THAT'S ENOUGH.

46:00.507 --> 46:03.509
ARE YOU FEELING
SORRY FOR ME OR...

46:03.677 --> 46:05.678
FOR YOURSELF?

46:05.846 --> 46:08.139
HEY, I'M THE ONE
THAT'S BLIND,
YOU KNOW,

46:08.307 --> 46:09.599
AND YOU BETTER
GET USED TO IT

46:09.767 --> 46:12.935
BECAUSE
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GOING TO BE.

46:13.103 --> 46:17.899
LAURA, BEFORE
I WENT BLIND,
I PLANNED TO TEACH.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.568
WELL, I'M A TEACHER.

46:20.736 --> 46:23.821
BEFORE
I WENT BLIND, I HAD
A WONDERFUL FAMILY.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.908
I STILL DO, PLUS
A WONDERFUL HUSBAND

46:27.075 --> 46:29.660
AND A SISTER
I LOVE VERY MUCH.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.247
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

46:33.415 --> 46:36.083
YOU GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT NOW?

46:36.251 --> 46:38.961
YEAH, I'M GOING
TO BE OK.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.963
I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.549
SORRY I DIDN'T
WRAP IT.

46:43.717 --> 46:47.595
OHH...
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.723
WHATEVER MADE YOU
THINK OF THIS?

46:50.891 --> 46:53.309
OH, I DON'T KNOW. I...

46:53.477 --> 46:55.937
I JUST KNEW IT WOULD BE
SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.855
OH, I DO.

46:58.023 --> 47:01.484
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE
EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

47:02.945 --> 47:05.196
ISN'T THAT
FRESH PAINT I SMELL?

47:05.364 --> 47:06.447
YEAH.

47:06.615 --> 47:08.616
BUT ISN'T THIS THE
OLD EDWARDS PLACE?

47:08.784 --> 47:10.284
MM-HMM.

47:10.452 --> 47:11.744
WELL,
WHO IN THE WORLD

47:11.912 --> 47:13.871
WOULD WANT TO FIX UP
A PLACE LIKE THIS?

47:14.039 --> 47:15.623
WELL...

47:15.791 --> 47:19.293
ALBERT AND I THOUGHT
IT WOULD MAKE
A NICE CLUBHOUSE.

47:19.461 --> 47:20.419
OH.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.630
WELL, WHAT COLORS
ARE YOU PAINTING IT?

47:22.798 --> 47:24.340
PINK AND PURPLE!

47:27.302 --> 47:31.097
PINK...AND...PURPLE?

47:31.265 --> 47:32.723
YEAH.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.184
YOU KNOW, LAURA,

47:35.352 --> 47:37.353
I'M KIND OF GLAD
I CAN'TSEE IT.

47:37.521 --> 47:38.896
[BOTH LAUGH]

47:39.064 --> 47:42.650
COME ON.
THE WHOLE FAMILY'S
WAITING AT SCHOOL.
