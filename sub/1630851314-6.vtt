Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.264 --> 00:04.743
I think someone's
getting murdered.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.397
Oh, my God, it's Kyle.
So you're benched until

00:06.441 --> 00:07.572
this handprint disappears.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.226
EDUARDO:
If you want a chance

00:09.270 --> 00:10.793
at solving this mystery,
you need to start

00:10.836 --> 00:13.578
by asking the right questions.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.885
You all right?

00:15.928 --> 00:17.060
Let me heal your heart.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.148
It's the only way to save Liz.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.107
Do it. [groans]

It's not over

You never forget
the exact moment

00:39.213 --> 00:41.258
when something
terrible happens.

ROSA:
Like a song stuck in your head,

00:42.520 --> 00:45.393
you replay all the details.

00:46.220 --> 00:49.832
ISOBEL:
Asking yourself
if you could've stopped it.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.531
LIZ:
If you'd only been smarter,
maybe you would've realized

00:53.575 --> 00:55.142
how the pieces fit together.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.579
MICHAEL:
But you didn't, because

00:57.622 --> 00:59.494
every mystery has
one thing in common.

[whooshing]

01:18.861 --> 01:20.167
Careful, kid.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.170
You're manhandling
a Deep State conspiracy.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.303
I, uh, spent some time
on the dark web.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.566
I didn't find anything
about a magic radio.[laughs]

01:28.610 --> 01:32.135
I also looked into this symbol,
and I couldn't find anything.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.791
Have you seen
this marking before?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.882
Do you believe in aliens?

01:40.926 --> 01:42.667
I, uh, believe in statistics.

01:42.711 --> 01:46.628
And I think it's improbable that
we're alone in the universe.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.109
What if I told you,

01:49.152 --> 01:51.894
the question isn't whether
or not they exist,

01:51.937 --> 01:54.940
it's how do we start
a conversation?

01:54.984 --> 01:58.248
Well, I would say,
"Good luck."

01:58.292 --> 02:01.338
'Cause knowing us, if
they decided to show themselves,

02:01.382 --> 02:03.123
we would probably just
kill them.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.994
And that is why
Deep Sky was created.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.343
Because I believe

02:06.387 --> 02:07.779
it doesn't have to be that way.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.739
If we could forge
a... connection

02:10.782 --> 02:13.350
with beings from
another galaxy,

02:13.394 --> 02:15.265
think of what could be possible.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.180
Is there any part of you
that thinks

02:17.224 --> 02:20.792
that aliens might pose a threat
to humanity?

02:21.532 --> 02:27.190
See, I came to Deep Sky
for personal reasons.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.888
Just like you did.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.194
I believe we have the power

02:31.238 --> 02:33.283
to shape the narrative
between our worlds,

02:33.327 --> 02:37.244
and it is up to us to make sure
we do that correctly.

02:37.287 --> 02:40.290
You think this symbol is
the key to doing that?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.902
Maybe.

02:43.946 --> 02:47.950
You asked whether the machine
was built for good or evil.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.126
In my opinion,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.302
there is never a reason

02:52.346 --> 02:54.913
to be afraid of the mysteries
of the universe.

It doesn't make any sense.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.250
Just tell us everything.
Start from the beginning.

03:27.294 --> 03:31.036
When I got to the house,
Maria was unconscious.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.430
So, of course, I rushed over
to check on her.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.823
Then,

03:34.866 --> 03:37.129
some guy
in an alien mask jumped me.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.522
I was able to throw him off,

03:38.566 --> 03:40.872
and he-he went
through the patio doors.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.309
Before I could go after him,

03:42.352 --> 03:44.354
there must have been a second
guy, 'cause I got slammed

03:44.398 --> 03:48.445
into a wall, and that's when
everything started to get foggy.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.360
Did you call the sheriff?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.319
Well, she was already there
when I came to.

03:52.362 --> 03:56.061
Sheriff thinks that
the Regiment wanted to scare me,

03:56.105 --> 03:58.063
and then, Maria was just

03:58.107 --> 03:59.761
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.284
Okay, what about Kyle?

04:01.328 --> 04:04.505
Well, his car's there,
but there's no sign of him.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.159
The sheriff and I are
pulling warrants to search

04:07.203 --> 04:08.857
any known affiliate
of the Regiment.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.293
MICHAEL:
It's obviously them.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.990
Jordan already tried
to kill Kyle once.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.297
Yeah, but it's kind of hard to
commit a crime from behind bars.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.604
So one of his bigoted buddies
did it for him.

04:16.647 --> 04:20.260
Well, if they'd beat him up,
I'd buy it, but kidnapping...

04:20.303 --> 04:21.478
[sighs heavily]

04:21.522 --> 04:25.134
No. Kyle wouldn't run.
Not with Maria injured.

MICHAEL:
Ash is drying up.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.703
The funeral Maria saw
would be any day now.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.096
Kyle is not dead.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.881
In Maria's vision,
she was healthy.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.884
Now she's in a coma,
so I-I guess we know

04:35.927 --> 04:37.320
she can change the future.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.541
The question is how much?

04:40.584 --> 04:41.759
There is one more thing.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.371
When I was driving
to the house,

04:44.414 --> 04:46.329
there was this flash of light

off in the desert.
I didn't tell the sheriff.

thing we need is

04:50.333 --> 04:51.421

the case as well.

Okay.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.297
I'll look into the
alien blast in the desert.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.910
[sighs] Okay, so if the Regiment
doesn't have Kyle, who does?

05:01.953 --> 05:03.651
That is an excellent question,

head back to the house

She just-- She's not
herself right now.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.013
I tried explaining
what was happening,

06:02.057 --> 06:04.015
and I don't think she got it,
she just kept yelling,

06:04.059 --> 06:05.843
"The alien will hear her."

06:05.887 --> 06:07.671
That's from A Quiet Place.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.239
It could be a clue.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.023
Or maybe she's just

her daughter's in a coma.

found her yet?

how she's progressed

06:30.477 --> 06:31.739

I mean, surely you have
a theory, though.

you were working on at Genoryx?

we should do?

it'll keep her brain

are the most critical.

what happened to Kyle.

anything out of the ordinary?

No.

this morning.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.334
Right, but there has
to be a clue, so,

08:29.378 --> 08:30.640
do you think it's
an alien thing?

08:30.684 --> 08:32.424
Have you checked
for fractal patterns?

08:32.468 --> 08:33.991
Yeah, I checked.
There was none.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.863
But you haven't found anything?

08:35.906 --> 08:38.561
That's why I let you join me
at an active crime scene.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.782
Maybe you can see
something I missed.What?

08:41.825 --> 08:44.175
I haven't been here in a year.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.655
Then why did you
insist on coming?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.048
Because something here
has to point to

08:47.091 --> 08:48.832
why Kyle is missing
and Maria is in a coma.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.791
Right, exactly. So why don't you
just focus on that?

08:50.834 --> 08:53.184
Yes, I am focusing.
I am focusing on

08:53.228 --> 08:54.751
attempting to solve this
together.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.884
So why are you still
pushing me away?

09:27.131 --> 09:29.960

09:30.004 --> 09:33.355

a goth phase.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.097
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
You know?

09:36.140 --> 09:38.360
I'm just gonna stay here

09:41.798 --> 09:44.845
until you decide
you want to talk to me.

09:44.888 --> 09:48.544
I didn't realize "feed the dog"
also meant walk him.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.719
I looked at the house,

09:49.763 --> 09:51.547
and you're right,
there's nothing there.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.505
I don't think the house
is the crime scene.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.420
I think this is.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.597
It was like this
when I got here.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.424
Did you just conveniently
forget to tell us

09:59.468 --> 10:00.774
that you had something
buried in the desert?

10:00.817 --> 10:03.646
Well-- [sighs]
I wasn't sure it was relevant.

10:03.690 --> 10:04.952
Given we're looking
for a motive,

10:04.995 --> 10:06.562
this is absolutely relevant.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.651
Forget motive, but I think
I found your weapon.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.131
You're the only person
I know that can

10:25.625 --> 10:27.714
at the radio tower
by Verna's Vista.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.543
I think I got a lead
on what happened to Valenti.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.465
So, lightning caused the flash
that I saw last night?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.772

10:47.908 --> 10:49.953
"Let this guide the way."

10:49.997 --> 10:51.694
And it did.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.827
Right into this pole.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.959
I mean, this much damage,

10:56.003 --> 10:59.180
it takes a lot of velocity.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.792
My guess is the glass
inside the radio provided it.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.751
It was wired
to a prehistoric transmitter

11:04.794 --> 11:06.709
Papa Jim tucked
inside of it.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.233
My guess? Valenti used the radio
to call for help,

11:09.277 --> 11:10.713
but it malfunctioned
due to Jim's

11:10.757 --> 11:12.976
primitive understanding
of alien tech.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.022
And it fried every tower
in a 20-mile radius.

11:15.065 --> 11:17.633
Okay, so, then,
why did it hit this one?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.548
It's the closest to Max's house.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.376
And when I heard
Sanders giddy

11:21.419 --> 11:22.725
that pricey
communication equipment

11:22.769 --> 11:24.727
was scattered
throughout the desert

11:24.771 --> 11:27.687
because of an electrical surge,
I started thinking

11:27.730 --> 11:29.950
about the explosion you saw
when you were driving.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.429
Which led me here

11:31.473 --> 11:34.694
to find a splintered
Valenti heirloom and...

11:34.737 --> 11:36.783
suicidal bats.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.829
The surge killed
all these bats?

11:39.873 --> 11:41.483
What do I look like,
a zoologist?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.876
All I'm saying is
there's a good chance

11:42.919 --> 11:46.401
whoever answered the SOS
has Valenti.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.924
Or whoever's blood

11:47.968 --> 11:49.709
is on that shovel has Valenti.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.407
We found a shovel

11:52.450 --> 11:56.890
by a large, empty hole about a
half mile from Max's back door.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.240
A hole?

11:59.283 --> 12:01.851

right now

12:04.680 --> 12:06.943

12:09.380 --> 12:11.426
You didn't tell her.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.341
When we found Jones,

12:13.384 --> 12:14.777
he had a sword

12:14.821 --> 12:16.692
made of alien glass.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.608
The hiding place
shouldn't have been a problem

12:19.651 --> 12:21.784
since I'm the only one
that can touch it.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.091
Are you saying you had
a sword that recognizes DNA?

12:24.134 --> 12:27.355
Burns the crap out of anybody
without this dude's face.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.009
Does this mean
that Jones could be out?

12:29.052 --> 12:30.619
No.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.230
No. First thing I did,
I went to the cave.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.971
He's still there,
safely in stasis.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.887
Okay, so... could they have
lifted it with something?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.193
Maybe.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.673
But they would have to know
what it was.

anyone answered Kyle's call.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.907
Our best bet
is still the science.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.910
If we can figure out
whose blood is on that shovel,

13:00.954 --> 13:03.739
we'll have a good idea
what happened to Kyle.

vampire bats different?

22:51.152 --> 22:53.937
They hunt using infrared.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.071
Radio waves travel
in all directions,

22:57.114 --> 22:59.508
but infrared
only travels in one.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.250
Were the bats
at all of the towers?No.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.425
Just three of 'em.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.471
What if the radio signal

23:05.514 --> 23:07.777
masked the real signal,
which is what the bats detected?

23:07.821 --> 23:09.823
And they were only
at these three towers

23:09.866 --> 23:12.303
'cause they were only drawn
to the infrared signal.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.218
And so was the radio.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.438
That's why it crashed
into the tower.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.441
Where did you find the bats?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.665
So these

23:25.708 --> 23:26.796

23:26.840 --> 23:29.408
transmitted the real signal.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.454

24:51.228 --> 24:52.578
