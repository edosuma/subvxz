[Gogo] Yo, bro.
Have you ever heard of Pemba Island?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.680
[man] No. Where is that?

00:25.840 --> 00:27.520
[Gogo] It's a small island in Tanzania.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.480
-[man] Yeah?
-[Gogo] Africa.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.600
Yeah.
I heard it's beautiful out there, man.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.120
-[man] Hmm.
-[Gogo] Like, unbelievable.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.720
[man] Sounds mad.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.840
[siren wailing]

00:38.600 --> 00:41.400
[Gogo] Talkin' sun, clear skies,

00:42.880 --> 00:45.360

00:45.440 --> 00:46.640

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
[camera shutters]

00:47.800 --> 00:49.880
[man] Yeah, man, I hear you.

-[glass shatters]
-[siren wailing]

00:52.040 --> 00:54.280
[Gogo] I'm gonna go though,
trust me.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.680
One day soon enough,
I'll finna be there.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.880
[man] The motherland's home still.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.520
[Gogo] I've been thinking about it
a lot recently, man.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.000
[man] Yeah. Thinking what?

01:04.120 --> 01:06.080
About us.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.200
This life we're living, like.

01:08.280 --> 01:12.440
[man] Huh?
Yo, bro, man, talk to me, man.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.880
What's going on?

01:13.920 --> 01:17.280
-You alright?
-[Gogo] Bro, we're fucking traumatised.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.720
It's deep, and we don't even realise it,
but we are, you know?

01:22.800 --> 01:24.480
[man] Deep, how though?

01:24.560 --> 01:26.680
[Gogo] Fam, do you know where
the actual word "trauma" comes from?

01:26.760 --> 01:29.280
Like, where it originated from and that?

01:29.360 --> 01:31.120
It's a Greek word, yeah. Look it up.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.680
It means "wound".

01:34.760 --> 01:35.800
[man] For real?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.800
[Gogo] Like an actual wound
like a scar, fam.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
[man] That's deep.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.880
[Gogo] We're just wounded men
out here, man.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.120
[exhales]

01:48.160 --> 01:50.360
-[Gogo] And you know somethin'?
-[man] What?

01:50.440 --> 01:52.080
[Gogo] You know,
the best way to treat a wound,

01:52.160 --> 01:53.840
like the best way for it to heal properly?

01:53.920 --> 01:55.440
[man] Go on.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.880
[Gogo] Gotta give it air, bro.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.400
Air to breathe.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
[man] Yeah.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.440
[Gogo] That's why I gotta go.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.600
I gotta get out of here, man.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.560
I gotta breathe.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.360
[man] Uh-hmm.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.600
[Gogo] I just feel like if I stay here...

02:16.720 --> 02:18.160
[man] You stay here, what?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
[Gogo] I'm gonna die.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.440
[Gogo] Ay, yo, forget it.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.960
Maybe I'm just goin' mad or somethin',
chatting shit as usual.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.480
Hey, man, listen,
I'm gonna go though, yeah?

02:46.560 --> 02:47.840
[man] Where you going?

02:47.920 --> 02:50.360
Slim's waiting for me outside,
we got somethin' on.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.880
[man] You still fucking with Slim?

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
Yeah.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.720
After tonight, I'm done.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.160
Like, I'm done-done.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.120
[man] How many times
have I heard you say that?

03:09.640 --> 03:10.720
A few.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.600
And this time feels different.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.160
[man] Hmm.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.360
Hope that's a good thing.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.760
Yeah. So do I, man.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.720
Yeah, but look, chat
to you later though, yeah?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.200
[man] Say nuttin'.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.720
[Gogo] Alright. In a bit.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.520
[dramatic music playing]

03:38.600 --> 03:41.320
[indistinct chatter]

03:41.400 --> 03:44.160
[narrator] What if I told you
that this was all real?

03:45.600 --> 03:48.160
That it wasn't just a story
or a bunch of cameras,

03:48.240 --> 03:51.120
actors and musicians all put together
for your entertainment?

03:52.240 --> 03:54.440
Would it make this message
any less important?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.160
Like, what if I told you that this...

03:58.240 --> 03:59.280
Hey, handsome.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.560
-[narrator] This right here...
-Listen, I just need, like--

04:01.640 --> 04:03.400
-Nah, fam.
-[narrator] That this was our world.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.080
Well, fuck you, then!

04:05.160 --> 04:06.760
[narrator] Things we've experienced.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.880
Things we've seen.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.720
Would it make a difference at all
to the way you guys see things?

04:11.800 --> 04:14.240
Give you a better understanding, of us?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.960
-[alarm ringing]
-[man] Oi, stop!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.080
[narrator] Probably not, right?

04:21.480 --> 04:25.360
Anyway, maybe you just find it easier
to believe it's just a story.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.880
Because if it's just a story,
then it's not real.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.760
And if it's not real, when it's all over,

04:29.800 --> 04:33.000
you can just switch off your TV
and forget all about it.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.920
Close your eyes and rest easy.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.040
Get a good night's sleep.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.080
But see, the truth is,
we live in a different world

04:45.160 --> 04:47.000
to the one you guys do.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.720
The same rules just don't apply.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.320
[old man] Splendid. Splendid.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.160
[narrator] See, your idea of beef
is a tender sirloin steak,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.000
served medium rare or somethin'.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.560
While, ours is...

05:00.120 --> 05:02.360
Well, look, let's just say ours
is a little somethin' different.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.920
[siren wailing]

05:05.040 --> 05:08.880
So, yeah. Yeah, we'll just go ahead
and call this a story then,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.360
just another story from the hood.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.440
And, as we all know,
every story has a beginning.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.720
So, with that being said,

05:22.800 --> 05:24.520
I guess we should let the story begin.

be able to sell it to you like that.

might cause or the disaster it'll bring?
