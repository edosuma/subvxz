CARTER:
Previously on Eureka.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.373
I would love to know who's
responsible for all this.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.624
lam.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.802
You're not alone.
You have friends.

00:18.477 --> 00:21.935
Marry me, Allie. Again.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.027
CARTER: All I'm saying
is that it's a big step,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.238
and I'm a little
surprised at myself.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.732
But it's unsettling.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.904
I'm almost 17.
Lots of kids my age
are doing it.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.028
Lots of kids your age
are doing lots of things.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.867
I thought you'd be proud
of me, being responsible.

00:40.999 --> 00:45.117
I am. I am.
I'm just adjusting to
my little kid growing up.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.040
l'm waitressing
part time at
Cafe Diem.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.412
It's not like
I'm walking
down the aisle.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.959
I know,
and that place
isn't safe.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.382
Who knows how many
radioactive isoscopes

00:52.511 --> 00:54.502
Vincent has flying around
that nuclear reactor

00:54.555 --> 00:55.840
he calls a kitchen?

00:55.973 --> 00:59.465
Isotopes.
And it's fusion reactor,
it's not fission.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.640
It's much safer.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.058
Not helping.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.765
So are you gonna go
see Henry?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.605
Yeah. It's time for my
weekly chest whipping.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.646
It's his hearing today,
so it might be the last one.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.146
They're not gonna convict him.
I mean, they can't.
He's Henry.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.948
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

01:17.077 --> 01:20.695
Just wear a lead apron.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.656
Okay.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.669
Triple Kampuchean,
double foam latte for Zane

01:29.798 --> 01:31.834
and Bavarian
espresso hammer for Jo.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.175
I'm here. Where do | start?

01:35.304 --> 01:38.717
You are late, little miss,
so you can start by
bussing tables.

01:38.849 --> 01:39.838
Great!

01:41.476 --> 01:46.015
Doing the final test
of the Viper today.
You want to celebrate later?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.058
Obviously.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.150
VINCENT: Hi, guys.
What?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.989
Oh, I'm just wondering when
you're gonna quit playing
hard to get

01:58.118 --> 01:59.779
and give me an answer.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.574
ALLISON:
I want to, Nathan.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.743
There's a reason why things
didn't work out with us
before.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.868
You always put your
work first. It...

02:09.004 --> 02:11.746
Allie. I'm not
that guy anymore.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.123
What do I got to do
to prove it to you?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.669
Well, I think you're
gonna be given a chance.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.884
The Department of Defense
liaison's gonna be here
at any time.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.550
They're not gonna fire you.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.763
What ifthe D.O.D. blames me
for Henry's security breach
and reinstates you?

02:27.636 --> 02:27.773
Then, you'll be my hot,
little assistant.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.263
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:29.399 --> 02:30.900
I'm serious, you...

02:31.026 --> 02:33.267
It's gonna be fine.
I promise.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.359
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

02:36.990 --> 02:40.448
lt's Fargo.
Viper test is ready.
We better go.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.865
Okay.
PATRON: Thanks. You know it.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.874
Oh, my goodness.
Guess who popped
the question?

02:52.673 --> 02:56.666
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

03:08.313 --> 03:10.304
Big test today, Fargo.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.149
D.O.D. will be here.
Don't push the wrong button.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.064
Shut up, Larry.
You all set, Dr. Edison?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.564
Yes, I am.
Prepare for defeat, boys.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.441
Martha, here, is gonna
make me proud.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.566
(BEEPING)

03:25.956 --> 03:28.413
Oh, my God,
what's she doing here?

03:29.084 --> 03:30.745
The Fixer.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.708
Her latest book makes
Sun Tzu look like
Mary Poppins.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.329
(CHUCKLING) Oh,
you are so dead.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.463
ALLISON: Who's the Fixer?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.298
FARGO: Eva Thorne.
The woman's a
Wall Street legend.

03:39.428 --> 03:40.759
She's dismantled and
rebuilt more

03:40.887 --> 03:43.629
Fortune 500 companies
than anyone in history.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.552
She coined the term
downsizing,
fired Lee Iacocca.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.768
Well, why would the DOD.
send a corporate killer
to Global Dynamics?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.103
I'm guessing it's not
to hand out promotions.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.769
Oh, God, this is it.
Here she comes.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.740
Eva Thorne,
this is a huge honor.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.955
You must be Douglas Fargo.
She knows my name.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.698
She knows my...
She knows my name.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.043
Fargo, I have a feeling
that Miss Thorne knows
everyone's name.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.663
Doctor Blake,
please, call me Eva.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.005
Pleasure.

04:19.134 --> 04:24.754
And I assume
tall, dark, and brooding
here is Nathan Stark.

04:25.474 --> 04:29.763
Eva, I am so curious
as to why the
Department of Defense

04:29.895 --> 04:32.637
would send a
business tycoon
to Eureka.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.388
I'm here to help.

04:34.524 --> 04:38.984
The D.O.D. asked me to
review operations for
a few days,

04:39.112 --> 04:43.105
see if I can offer up any
suggestions for improvements.

04:44.159 --> 04:47.276
Here, in Eureka, we have the
greatest minds in the world,

04:47.412 --> 04:50.700
solving the greatest
mysteries in the universe.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.333
Can't put
a price tag on that.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.075
Maybe you can't,
but I'm pretty sure I can.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.749
Global Dynamics is gonna
have to start earning
its keep,

04:57.881 --> 04:59.621
and I believe I can
help you do that.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.794
Show me what you got.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.055
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Stand by, all personnel.

05:09.184 --> 05:13.393
Viper Defense System
initialization sequence
will begin.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.643
ALLISON: This is G.D.'s
advanced weapons
testing facility.

05:17.776 --> 05:21.610
The variety of terrain options
afford us many different
attack scenarios.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.400
THORNE: So, tell me what
you're testing today.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.273
The Viper Anti-Missile
Defense Array

05:26.409 --> 05:30.322
makes the Star Wars program
look like an Erector Set.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.946
The system can track
up to 12 targets.

05:33.083 --> 05:37.042
The turrets emit
hafnium powered photons
in controlled bursts.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.628
We've had 19 successful
tests. Today should make
a perfect 20.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.088
Not if Martha can help it.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.127
Martha?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.420
Ethan Edison.

05:44.553 --> 05:48.091
Ethan, this is Eva Thorne.
He designs our target drones.

05:48.223 --> 05:52.592
Martha's my latest design.
I really think she stands
a chance against the Viper.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.719
Manning the Viper with Fargo
in the G.D. control room
is Zane Donovan.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.815
He's been working with
Dr. Stark on perfecting
the Viper's tracking system.

05:59.943 --> 06:04.232
The same Zane Donovan
who crashed the
New York Stock Exchange?

06:05.156 --> 06:06.737
Allegedly.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.700
All right, boys,
let's show Miss Thorne
what the Viper can do.

06:11.162 --> 06:16.577
You got it.
Viper system is online.
Tracking system is active.

06:17.836 --> 06:21.249
Dr. Edison, it's time for
a little target practice.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.667
The drones will
proceed 1,000 meters
downrange,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.917
then turn back and commence
the simulated attack.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.225
The Viper's mission,
knock them all down.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.446
FARGO: Here they come.
Viper's locked and loaded.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.530
Stand by.
She's about to go hot.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.670
Any time now.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.255
FARGO: There's only
one drone left.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.635
Come on, Martha.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.972
THORNE: Dr. Stark,
what's going on here?

07:16.353 --> 07:19.971
FARGO: Hold on. Martha
is targeting the Viper.
What the hell?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.314
NATHAN: Look out!

07:23.443 --> 07:24.432

07:27.948 --> 07:29.688

responding to any
of my commands.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.163
Impressive.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.835
Great.

on G-seven. Check.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.071
Patience, Jack.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.196
Sometimes, the best offense
is a good defense.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.498
Speaking of which,
is that why you
fired your lawyer?

08:22.627 --> 08:27.667
It is. In my case,
there is no defense.
I lied. I endangered lives.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.130
I put Global Dynamics
at risk...

08:29.259 --> 08:31.500
Yes, but you also saved
Allison's son.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.753
Doing the right thing
for the wrong reason
is still a mistake.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.888
Rook on G-seven
to G-eight.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.179
That's not what I'm
talking about.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.399
Some things can't be forgiven,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.610
no matter how much
I wish they could.

Checkmate.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.131
Jo?
What's going on?

09:19.267 --> 09:22.430
The D.O.D. is confiscating
Henry's equipment as evidence.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.268
Oh, evidence of what, that
he never threw anything away?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.773
Hey, hey,
don't take that stuff.

09:25.899 --> 09:30.563
Carter, the court order says
everything goes. I'm sorry.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.071
Well, that isn't right.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.320
Does Allison know about this?

09:34.449 --> 09:36.781
I think she's focused on
more personal matters.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.320
Yeah, like what?

09:38.453 --> 09:39.659
Oh, you know.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.903
No.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.781
She hasn't mentioned
any new developments?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.408
Jo?
Stark proposed.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.919
Oh.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.005
You okay?
Yeah.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.673
Yeah, good for her.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.506
Wow. If she's happy,
I'm happy.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.892
You sure?
Absolutely. Yeah.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.727
Yeah, well, you know,
we didn't have a future.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.938
We didn't even have a present.

someone lose a UFO?

10:27.627 --> 10:32.087
It's not a UFO.
It's a military attack drone,
named Martha.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.170
Well, that's so much better.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.290
And it's not lost.
It's just not here.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.678
Yeah, but the Fixer is,
and given her reputation,

10:37.804 --> 10:39.669
if we don't find it, none
of us may be here for long.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.171
Hold on. A Fixer is?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.423
A silly nickname,
but what can you do?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.973
Carter, this is Eva Thorne.
She's doing a performance
review of G.D.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.346
Ah. Well, good luck with that.
Got your work cut out for you.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.437
So do you.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.649
Let's get Miss Thorne settled
and continue our tour

10:52.777 --> 10:54.813

handles this.

Yeah, any spare
office will do.

I just need someplace
to keep my things safe.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.319
Already taken care of,

11:00.451 --> 11:03.818
Miss Thorne, and I would be
honored to show you around.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.240
Give us a chance to talk
about your new book.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.957
(LAUGHING)
Great rewards require
great risk.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.125
I couldn't agree more.

by its cover, Sheriff.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.042
Lead the way.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.674
I really hate him.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.143

that drone back.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.476
I can't exactly
arrest it for speeding.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.721
We're trying to re-establish
microwave control,

11:30.857 --> 11:34.315
but we believe
the guy who built her
is trying to protect her.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.651
Why would he want
to protect a UFO?

11:37.280 --> 11:38.690
His name is Ethan Edison.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.529
He's in the Section Seven
test range,

11:40.658 --> 11:43.240
and you should go
sheriff him up.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.081
Your fiance is in a mood.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.496
How did you...
Small town.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.210
Oh, I haven't said yes.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.581
Well, it's none of my
business. Now, I got a
UFO to catch, so...

12:00.845 --> 12:03.757
I don't know what happened.
I stayed within
test parameters. I swear.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.721
Look, Mr. Edison,
nobody's blaming you.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.135
I'm blaming you.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.101
Nineteen tests.
That's 19 victories
for the Viper,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.595
19 losses for me.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.471
I finally win,
everyone's mad at me.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.473
Nobody's mad at you.
I'm mad at you.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.690
We're just trying to
figure out

12:16.819 --> 12:18.946
why your fancy
clay pigeon went AWOL.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.108
Martha is a
learning computer, okay?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.573
And she is developing at
an incredible rate.

12:23.701 --> 12:26.943
It's like she went
from being a toddler
to a teenager overnight.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.661
Well, your teenager
just stole a car,

12:28.790 --> 12:30.451
a gun, and ran away
from home.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.494
Now, she's dangerous,
and we need her back.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.868
Believe me, Sheriff,
I'd like nothing more,

12:35.004 --> 12:36.710
but, given her
current state of mind,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.831
the last thing that
you should do is threaten her.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.960
Well, okay, given.
But we need this fixed.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.429
Martha's not responding
to her control signal,

12:46.557 --> 12:48.263
and she's flying
below radar range.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.554
Eureka's electromagnetic
security barrier should

12:50.687 --> 12:52.052
keep her contained
within the city,

12:52.188 --> 12:53.689
but I'm worried about her,
Shenﬁ.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.022
She's growing up way too fast.

12:56.150 --> 12:59.358
Oh, believe me, I get that,
but we need her back.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.611
Vin, nobody orders
the same dish twice.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.779
French, Italian, Namibian?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.777
How am I supposed to
memorize the menu
if you don't have one?

13:09.914 --> 13:13.532
There's only one rule
at Cafe Diem, Zoe.
You want it, we got it.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.453
Come with me for a sec.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.746
Now, if you're
gonna work here,
you need to

13:16.879 --> 13:18.961
be able to navigate
the walk-in fridge, Zo.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.418
Navigate?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.468
Whoa!

13:26.222 --> 13:27.928
It's like Narnia.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.514
Ponchos are on the left.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.224
Take the shuttle
if you need food
from the back.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.342
Now, here's what I need.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.980
We have a VIP
coming for lunch

13:35.106 --> 13:36.846
and I want to whip up
something special.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.770
So, good luck.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.326
See anything?

13:51.456 --> 13:52.445
JO: Not yet.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.580
You run Edison's file?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.745
Yeah, graduated Cal Tech,

13:56.878 --> 13:59.711
where he married his
lab partner, Mina.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.454
Fifteen years, he's been
building drones

14:01.591 --> 14:02.831
and Global keeps
shooting them down.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.832
Never had a win before today.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.880
Well, he finally
made up for it.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.379
I vote for a coffee break,
we can visit Zoe.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.805
Yeah, no time
and rather not.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.808
Carter, you got to be
more supportive.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.676
A little independence
is good for her.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.230
See? That's where it starts.
Next, it's gonna be,
"I want my own place,"

14:19.359 --> 14:20.815
then, "Did I mention
my boyfriend's moving in?"

14:20.943 --> 14:22.729
And, "Why wait to
get married? Because
we love each other now."

14:22.862 --> 14:24.853
And, "Congratulations,
you're a grandpa."

14:25.698 --> 14:27.814
And, I hope,
all in that order.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.326
Hey, exactly
how big is this thing,

14:29.452 --> 14:31.818
like, bigger
than a breadbox?

14:32.830 --> 14:35.822
Oh, crap.
Meet me at the
Sheriff's Office.

14:45.885 --> 14:50.174
Hi!
Martha, is it? Yes.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.969
We have a lot of people
looking for you.

14:54.477 --> 14:58.061
Ethan is worried sick.

14:58.189 --> 15:02.683
I'm gonna call him
right now

15:02.819 --> 15:04.684
so he can
come take you home.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.402
Jo, drop it.
Don't threaten her.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.738
Her? What about us?
Jo. Jo.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.901
(BEEPING)

15:10.326 --> 15:11.782
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

15:15.039 --> 15:16.540
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

15:23.756 --> 15:25.257
Noted.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.339
Jo, we've got to get her
off the streets, okay?
Yeah.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.430
Just follow us
for a second.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.540
Easy.
Nice killer drone.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.918
Where the hell'd she go?

16:10.928 --> 16:12.509
I'm guessing, there.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.629
Yeah.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.383
So, it's an invisible,
killer drone?

16:19.270 --> 16:21.636
Just keeps
getting better.
What's the plan?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.143
Kind of improvising
here, Jo.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.434
(SHUSHING)

16:28.988 --> 16:30.819
She's at my one o'clock.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.358

16:32.492 --> 16:33.823
Three brothers, yeah.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.863
Blanket blitz, on three.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.659
One, two, three!

16:42.001 --> 16:43.161
Got it!
Oh!

16:43.294 --> 16:44.750
(SCREAMING)

16:51.511 --> 16:52.751
What do you want me to do?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.837
CARTER: The cell!

16:58.226 --> 17:00.387
Get her in the cell! Whoa!

17:03.689 --> 17:05.190
(WARBLED ELECTRONIC VOICE)

17:05.650 --> 17:06.856
I can't believe that worked.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.897
We rule.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.743
(EXHALES)

17:28.422 --> 17:29.958
We so don't rule.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.971
You tried to arrest it?

17:40.101 --> 17:41.466
We tried to contain it.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.514
By putting a weaponized
attack drone in jail?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.680
Well, when you
put it like that...

17:47.817 --> 17:50.183
I don't presume to know
how to do yourjob, Sheriff,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.810
but these numbers
are concerning.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.735
They show the various
incidents in Eureka
over the past 50 years.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.192
What are all the
red dots over there?

17:59.954 --> 18:02.946
That would be the period
since you've been here,
Sheriff Carter.

18:04.584 --> 18:05.573
Oh.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.248
I take it, red is bad?

18:10.381 --> 18:12.417
Yes, red is bad.
Red is costly.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.087
To be frank, your budget
can't afford you.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.588
So, this is somehow my fault?

18:20.725 --> 18:21.805
Numbers don't lie.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.219
I don't cause
the problems around here.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.635
Look, can the two of you get
along for five minutes?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.851
Not likely.
Not likely.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.061
Martha is out of control.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.146
We need Ethan to
find a way to find her

18:30.276 --> 18:31.937
before things
escalate any more.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.859
Okay. Um...

18:34.238 --> 18:36.445
Jo, let's get
everyone off the street,
until she's found.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.158
Oh, declaring martial law
on review day?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.989
Not exactly a highlight
for the resume.

18:43.122 --> 18:47.161
I got to protect the town.
You protect you,
it's what you do best.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.664
Jo, can I...

18:56.302 --> 18:58.213
I'm gonna go with him.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.474
So, you and Carter
don't exactly get along?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.269
Not exactly.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.730
Allison seems to think
rather highly of him.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.062
We all have
our blind spots.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.686
For what it's worth,
I think you were dead on.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.942
When you're running
a place like this,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.274
people need to follow orders,
not question them.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.823
They just need
to be reminded
who's in charge.

19:25.915 --> 19:26.870
Can I go?

19:27.333 --> 19:28.448
Of course.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.257
ALLISON: Here's Ethan's.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.798
All right, just get it
off your chest.
I know it's killing you.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.096
Honestly, I don't know
how you could consider
marrying him again.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.554
I don't know, Carter.
Maybe I still love him.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.644
Oh, well, then, you guys have
something in common.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.392
He loves him, too.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.242
Oh. Sorry, I thought
you were Ethan.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.733
No, but we're looking for him.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.906
Well, he should be home
any minute.
Why? Is something wrong?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.947
Yeah, you might want to hold
off on the champagne.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.207
Mina and I havejust worked
for so long to get a win,

20:19.343 --> 20:22.301
I just didn't have the heart
to tell her how the test went
until we found Martha.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.715
Well, Martha found me.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.930
She attacked me,
and then she turned invisible.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.841
Where do you think she is?

20:27.977 --> 20:31.435
I don't know,
but I know Martha,
and if she wanted to hurt you,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.350
you wouldn't be
standing here right now.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.438
But cloaking?
Clever girl.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.480
She must have somehow figured
out how to upgrade her system.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.398
Are you telling me
you didn't program
her to do that?

20:40.531 --> 20:43.819
No! See, each version has
different abilities, right?

20:43.951 --> 20:47.284
Like thermal defense,
infrared, x-ray,

20:47.413 --> 20:49.825
but cloaking always drains
the fusion power cell.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.163
So I left it out
this time.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.032
Oh, trust me, she has it.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.084
Maybe that photon blast
that she absorbed

20:56.213 --> 20:58.465
somehow supercharged her
microprocessor.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.798
Well, we better get her back,
before she hurts someone.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.422
Hey, listen, the only reason
that she came after you

21:04.555 --> 21:07.513
is because she's
on the defensive,

21:07.641 --> 21:09.927
but if she's cloaking,
she's gonna have to
come home to recharge.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.049
(CARS APPROACHING)

21:12.229 --> 21:13.935
MAN: Go! Go! Go!

21:14.064 --> 21:16.726

boxed up and taken back
to Global Dynamics,

disassembled and analyzed.

what are you doing?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.569
Myjob.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.778
Sheriff, I'll take it
from here.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.988
Does it matter that
all of this is evidence

21:25.117 --> 21:26.857
in an active
police investigation?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.575
Nope. You had
your shot, Sheriff.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.784
This is all property of
Global Dynamics,

21:29.914 --> 21:31.620
which means it is
out of your jurisdiction.

21:31.749 --> 21:32.989
Dr. Stark,
please, don't do this.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.240
My work is all I have.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.753
It's not your work,
anymore, Dr. Edison.

21:36.879 --> 21:40.872
Martha's become a dangerous
and expensive liability.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.876
I'm sorry, Ethan.
You violated test parameters.
You're done.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.883
It's okay, Ethan.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.469

Besides the ruggedly
handsome, successful,

22:10.246 --> 22:13.409
Thanks, Jo.
Zane, Ethan swears
that the photon blast

22:13.541 --> 22:15.748
made Martha smart enough to
upgrade her own system.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.253
No way, software, maybe,
but hardware? Not a chance.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.289
All right.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.831
So, who would want to
do this to her?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.001
I don't know. But they'd
have to know how to hijack

22:23.133 --> 22:24.589
an encrypted frequency
to control her.

22:24.718 --> 22:28.961
He also says that
cloaking drains her battery,
so she'll need to recharge.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.053
Mmm-hmm.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.889
But if Stark took
all of his equipment,

22:33.018 --> 22:34.849
maybe she'll
follow him to G.D.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.311
No, the security's too tight.
It'll need another source.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.771

to do her any good.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.705
Look out!

25:01.834 --> 25:02.823
(SCREAMS)

25:16.015 --> 25:16.800
You okay?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.297
Yeah.
Is she out?

25:18.434 --> 25:19.844
I don't know.

25:19.977 --> 25:20.966
Everyone else okay?

25:21.103 --> 25:22.309
Yeah.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.769
I'm okay.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.353
Larry isn't.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.993
I don't get it. I mean,
she seemed so nice.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.835
Yeah.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.253
Go home, sweetie.
Why?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.376
Because, working here
isn't safe.

25:55.512 --> 25:59.926
I can't worry about you
and do myjob, so... Sorry.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.382
You know, you can't
control me forever.

26:02.519 --> 26:05.636
Maybe not, but I can today.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.148
Sorry.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.356
Well, Larry's
unconscious, but alive.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.774
Martha and I were
face to face.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.942
Why'd she take
a shot at Thorne?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.487
Poorjudgment.
Well, there's plenty
of that to go around.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.234
I appreciate what
you did, Sheriff,

26:20.370 --> 26:21.826
but this town
is out of control.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.662
I want you to take
this thing back
to Global Dynamics

26:24.792 --> 26:26.077
and have it
permanently dismantled.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.702
As far as my
review is concerned,
it's not looking good.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.876
Perfect.
So, what do we do now?

26:38.764 --> 26:41.471
We finish what we started.
What's this?

26:44.895 --> 26:47.056
That would be a remote
transmitter.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.225
So, someone has been
controlling Martha.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.977
Someone who wants
to hurt Thorne.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.443
Everyone's job is on the line.
I'm sure there's a lot of
people who would celebrate

26:54.571 --> 26:55.947
if she wasn't around.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.651
Or one person in particular.

27:04.658 --> 27:04.790
We think she tied into
the cafe's power supply
to stay cloaked,

27:04.790 --> 27:06.496
and then she fired on Thorne.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.492
It's not in her programming
to attack someone unprovoked.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.791
That makes sense.
We think she had
a little outside help.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.879
Didn't she, Mina?

27:15.008 --> 27:16.043
I'm sorry?

27:16.176 --> 27:18.713
You were chilling champagne,
before the tests
were even over.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.837
You knew that
Martha was gonna win.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.843
Well, I hoped.
CARTER: No, you didn't.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.762
You guaranteed it.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.685
Sorry, I don't understand.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.557
What did you do?
Give her some extra
bells and whistles? Hmm?

27:32.901 --> 27:35.563
Just to give her the edge?
Mina?

27:35.696 --> 27:39.109
It's not easy living in a town
where everyone's exceptional,

27:39.241 --> 27:42.904
especially when they're given
every advantage to succeed,
but you're not.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.193
Ethan pours his heart
into his work,

27:45.330 --> 27:47.321
but there are always
restrictions that guarantee

27:47.457 --> 27:48.788
Martha's destroyed.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.455
My husband's a brilliant man,
who's only allowed to fail.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.582
For once, I just...

27:55.340 --> 27:59.049
I just wanted everyone to see
how talented he really is.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.756
Thank you, sweetheart.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.922
That's very touching,
but you went too far

28:05.058 --> 28:07.094
and now a man
is in the hospital.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.967
Well, Larry.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.560
I may have boosted
Martha's abilities,

28:10.689 --> 28:13.897
but I had no idea
she'd escape,
let alone hurt anyone.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.517
We found this remote
transmitter attached to her.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.611
Well, this didn't
come from me.

28:20.741 --> 28:24.029
It's not sophisticated enough
to keep her under control
for very long.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.651
But why go after Thorne?

28:25.787 --> 28:29.120
If Martha was after Thorne,
there's no way
she would have missed.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.165
Then Thorne wasn't
the target.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.876
Hey, Vince, did you find
anything when you were
cleaning up over there?

28:39.009 --> 28:41.671
Let me ask my waitress.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.134
Oh, right,
I can't, you fired her.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.378
Vince...
Look all you want.

28:44.514 --> 28:45.970
This mustard isn't gonna
clean itself.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.733
Hey, check it out.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.565
Larry had that
book with him all day.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.905
Yeah. Since when does
paper melt?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.703
Neverjudge a book
by its cover.

29:14.419 --> 29:18.162
I want you to take it apart.
Find out what made it
go on the attack.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.627
Sort of a shock
and awe-topsy.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.967
You don't do an
autopsy on a machine.

29:25.138 --> 29:28.596
From what I saw,
she's more human than
a lot of people I know.

29:28.725 --> 29:29.885
Well, let's find out why.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.892
Okay. Why me?

29:33.772 --> 29:37.640
Because I read your file
and I want the best person
for the job,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.607
unless you don't think
you're that person.

29:40.696 --> 29:45.360
No, no, I definitely am.
I just need to grab my gear.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.323
Let's get you started.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.160
CARTER: Larry.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.916
Larry!

30:02.092 --> 30:06.586
Oh, hey.
Don't be upset, guys.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.553
Doc says
I'm gonna be just fine.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.970
We brought some
reading material
to speed your recovery.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.973
It's not what it looks like.
Really?

30:16.106 --> 30:19.519
'Cause your book there
is programmed to the same
encrypted frequency

30:19.651 --> 30:21.812
as the transmitter
we found on the drone.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.152
Okay, it's a little
what it looks like.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.522
You've been controlling
Martha the entire time.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.613
Some of the time.

were you thinking?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.693
I knew the DOD.
was coming,

30:30.829 --> 30:32.444
and when I realized
who they sent,

30:32.581 --> 30:34.367
I freaked.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.833
I developed my E.L.F.
signal capturing remote
to use against enemy drones.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.915
Just wanted
to show it worked.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.289
By destroying the
entire Viper system?

30:43.425 --> 30:46.838
No! I hijacked the signal
before the test,

30:46.970 --> 30:49.712
but I was as surprised
as you when Martha
took out the Viper.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.134
I wanted to show my design
to Thorne at Cafe Diem

30:52.267 --> 30:54.553
and land Martha outside,

30:54.686 --> 30:57.849
but Martha snuck in
and ambushed me.

30:57.981 --> 31:01.724
Mina Edison boosted
Martha's learning capacity.
She outsmarted you.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.849
I'm really sorry.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.226
Well, you're lucky
that we got her back

31:04.363 --> 31:06.399
before things spiraled
out of control.

It's Martha.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.378
CARTER: So much for
things not spiraling
out of control.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.891
She's leading them into town.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.136
And, now, she's
completely autonomous.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.603
You think she's been
planning this all along?

31:40.732 --> 31:41.687
Planning what?

31:41.817 --> 31:44.524
Well, I mean, Martha can
disengage from Larry,

31:44.653 --> 31:45.608
she can beat
the Viper system,

31:45.737 --> 31:47.944
but then she goes down
after a couple pops
from our cap guns?

31:48.073 --> 31:49.233
She was playing possum.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.780
Well, now, you have an
artificially intelligent

31:53.912 --> 31:56.244

for payback.

Jo, signal a lockdown.
Everyone inside.

How many are there?

keep controlling
everything I do.

SARAH: Your father
does the best he can.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.816
What kind of crappy
platitude is that?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.106
The usual kind, I guess.

32:30.824 --> 32:34.032
I'm receiving orders from

that covers the town.

No, we have to
take it down, first.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.997
What?
Well, I don't think Martha
wants to hurt anyone.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.832
I think she's
the emotional equivalent

34:47.961 --> 34:49.622
of a pissed off teen
who needs some space.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.131
Except Martha's not a teen.
She's not even human.

When we were at the cafe,
she saw me ground my daughter,

and then she broke into
my house to set her free.

She may not be human,
but I don't think she's
bent on world domination.

Well, that's not a chance
I'm willing to take, Sheriff.

35:01.850 --> 35:02.839
We need air support, now.

on the attack,
then, so will she.

is no defense.

No, Carter almost
articulated a good point.
We escalate, so does she.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.572

first could be seen
as an olive branch.

Alpha Leader,
do you hear me?

36:52.961 --> 36:56.624
Hmm! Somebody
must've hijacked
the signal. Crazy.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.916
PILOT: Omega One,
we're going hot.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.553
Permission to engage?

37:02.679 --> 37:06.388
Negative, Alpha Leader.
Fire only if fired upon.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.007
You are making
a disastrous mistake.
No.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.011
Okay, Carter,
I really hope you're right.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.891
Tell me about it.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.059
Right, so you're sure Martha's
gonna be able to hear us
on this thing?

37:16.192 --> 37:19.025
Yeah, yeah,
but whether she listens
to us is another matter.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.901
PILOT: Omega One,
we're being targeted.

37:24.909 --> 37:25.989
We're live. We're live.
We're live.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.609
Well, if you have any
words of wisdom,

37:27.746 --> 37:30.408
like, "Don't start
World War Three,"
now's the time.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.825
Listen, Martha, it's Ethan.

37:34.961 --> 37:39.751
I know that you're upset,
but violence is not the answer

37:39.883 --> 37:42.215
and there's gonna be
consequences for your
acﬂons,younglady.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.925
If you want respect,
you're just gonna
have to earn it.

37:45.054 --> 37:48.763
Give me that.
Okay, Martha,
so, here's the deal.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.178
I know it sucks having
someone control
everything you do,

37:51.311 --> 37:53.267
but it's worse not to have
anyone care at all.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.852
I've had my fair share
of running away,

37:54.981 --> 37:57.597
and believe me,
it is no picnic
out there on your own.

37:57.734 --> 38:02.694
So, my advice to you
is take a lap,
let off some steam

38:02.822 --> 38:03.777
and come home.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.024
Parents only make us
miserable because they care.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.942
And don't start
World War Three.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.534
Right, and that.

38:11.664 --> 38:12.915
PILOT: Omega One,
target is closing.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.872
Request permission to fire.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.577
NATHAN: Negative, Alpha One,
hold your fire.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.875
Don't do it, Martha.
Come home.

38:22.467 --> 38:26.085
You just have to trust me.
Listen to me, Martha.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.680
PILOT: Alpha Leader,
roger that.
Engaging sidewinders.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.550
Roger.

38:39.943 --> 38:42.855
Omega One,
all targets
have disengaged.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.772
That's my girl.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.251
(ELECTRONIC HUMMING)

39:10.014 --> 39:14.974
You and your team
went behind my back
and undercut my direct order.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.809
Some of us went right
in front of your back.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.894
And we were right.
You were lucky.

39:19.023 --> 39:23.687
Yeah. But have you seen
the graph of all the red dots?

39:23.820 --> 39:25.936
Where the lunatics
are running the asylum?

39:26.072 --> 39:29.815
I used to think
the same thing,
but they're not lunatics.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.191
They're not all...

39:32.328 --> 39:35.320
There's a fine line
between genius and crazy.

39:35.456 --> 39:39.665
But, sometimes, the things
that they create are amazing,
like Martha.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.752
Which would have been
destroyed, had they
done things your way.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.712
But your way
could've been worse.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.457
Great rewards
require great risk.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.801
Big reader,
are you, Sheriff?

39:50.555 --> 39:52.295
I heard it somewhere.
Huh.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.509
So, what happens, now?

39:54.642 --> 39:57.975
Dr. Stark, I've decided,
on a trial basis,

39:58.104 --> 40:01.688
that you will resume
your duties as
Director of Research.

40:02.150 --> 40:05.859
No, I won't,
not without Dr. Blake.

40:05.987 --> 40:06.942
Oh, of course not.

40:07.071 --> 40:11.155
You may know science,
but your people skills
leave a lot to be desired.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.068
Dr. Blake, you will be the
new Director of Operations.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.616
So, we'll be co-heads
of Global Dynamics?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.910
No, more like
CEO and COO.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.954
Well, who's gonna be
the chairman?

40:22.086 --> 40:23.951
For the time being,
that would be me.

40:25.715 --> 40:31.051
G.D. needs
corporate partnership,
private capital, synergy.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.921
There are gonna be some
big changes around here.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.009
What is all of this?

40:36.142 --> 40:38.508
It's our first sponsor.
It's very exciting.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.101
Well, I'm gonna leave
this to you two.

40:40.229 --> 40:43.562
I have a drone-shaped hole
in my office to attend to.

40:46.694 --> 40:51.688
Carter! I just
wanted to say,

40:51.824 --> 40:55.817
it's been a really rough day
and you really came through
for everyone.

40:55.954 --> 40:56.943
Thanks.

40:58.915 --> 41:02.123
So, you and Stark?

41:02.919 --> 41:04.455
(LAUGHS)

41:05.380 --> 41:07.291
Yeah, I think so. Maybe.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.583
You really think
I'm making a mistake, huh?

41:12.720 --> 41:15.302
(STAMMERING)
No. No, no, I...

41:18.059 --> 41:21.472
I think whatever you decide,

41:23.314 --> 41:25.179
I'll be here for you.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.015
Really?

41:30.989 --> 41:31.978
Yeah.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.605
(LAUGHING)

41:33.908 --> 41:35.318
No, not really.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.029
Get out of here.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.542
You were willing to walk away
from Global for me?

41:46.671 --> 41:50.914
I told you, I want us
to be together
in the office, always.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.877
Nathan, do you really think
we can make this work?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.879
I know we can.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.505
Okay.

42:02.145 --> 42:04.511
Is that a yes?
That's a yes.

42:10.194 --> 42:13.527
Vincent, I think we're gonna
need a bottle of champagne.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.112
All right.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.904
Hey. Hell of
a first day, huh?

42:23.041 --> 42:25.157
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me come back.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.875
Yeah. I overreacted.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.911
Sorry I'm late.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.539
Yeah, I'm afraid you are.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.042
VINCENT: Champagne, coming up!

42:43.519 --> 42:44.508
Let's go.
