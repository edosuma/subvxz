03:14.179 --> 03:15.722
Hey!

03:16.556 --> 03:19.017
Grace

03:19.017 --> 03:20.685
Hey Grace!

03:20.685 --> 03:25.439
Come here a second, please!

03:31.028 --> 03:32.779
Yea?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.781
Have you seen my sister?

03:36.033 --> 03:39.036
Abeerah...

03:39.786 --> 03:42.122
Who? Abeerah?

03:42.122 --> 03:45.333
Yea, Abee. Is she still here?

03:45.333 --> 03:49.252
Ohhhh, Abee!

03:49.252 --> 03:54.925
Yea, she’s in there. Definitely wont be out anytime soon.

03:54.925 --> 03:58.845
So I guess you should head home. Instead of waiting around
here I mean.

03:58.845 --> 04:00.931
Yea, you’re right. Maybe I...

04:00.931 --> 04:05.977
And since you’re heading that direction anyway, you could
give me a ride one time.

04:06.227 --> 04:09.688
Uhhh, yea, I guess...

04:40.383 --> 04:45.013
So... You two had a good time?

04:49.600 --> 04:53.729
Yea, it was okay.

04:55.022 --> 04:58.775
I remember back in my day

04:58.775 --> 05:02.779
I used to party all night and go to sleep the next morning

05:02.779 --> 05:06.407
and wake up to work, normal normal after

05:06.407 --> 05:09.785
Days for that done, right?

05:16.417 --> 05:20.628
It’s the house with the white gate on the left.

05:25.134 --> 05:28.136
Thanks a lot.

05:39.104 --> 05:42.649
What the hell was that?

05:42.649 --> 05:45.277
Mom!

05:46.569 --> 05:48.612
Mom!

05:54.452 --> 05:56.662
Damn it.

05:57.621 --> 06:00.582
[SALEEM] (TEXT) What’s going on with you?
You know we have to be there soon!

06:00.582 --> 06:03.085
[ABEERAH] (TEXT) Relax na. Just get me later on.
Not ready to go yet.

06:03.085 --> 06:05.337
[SALEEM] (TEXT) No!

06:20.184 --> 06:23.187
So I need a ride back.

06:23.436 --> 06:26.731
Honestly I cant help you out right now. I have to get...

06:26.731 --> 06:30.109
Things, and stuff. So...

06:30.277 --> 06:32.028
Come on! Don’t be like that.

06:32.028 --> 06:35.031
Just drop me back to Adam’s place amd I'm sure Abee's
ready to leave by now.

06:35.031 --> 06:38.700
I really can’t right now. You are just going to have to wait
for a taxi or...

06:38.700 --> 06:41.703
[phone rings]

06:41.703 --> 06:44.706
You can’t seriously be calling after...

06:44.831 --> 06:49.211
Oh, sorry sorry. I thought you were Abeerah...

06:49.836 --> 06:53.714
No, she’s fine. Just the regular run around.

06:54.799 --> 06:57.802
Now?

06:58.636 --> 07:01.639
Well can I just...

07:02.514 --> 07:04.766
Okay, no problem.

07:04.766 --> 07:07.769
Okay, be there in ten.

07:08.187 --> 07:11.689
So, That's a yes?

07:12.398 --> 07:15.401
Hear what,

07:15.526 --> 07:18.654
[SALEEM] I have to make a quick stop then...
[GRACE] Oh God, just drop me first.

07:18.654 --> 07:21.448
It’s this or nothing.

07:21.448 --> 07:23.784
Fine!

07:23.784 --> 07:26.536
Let's just go.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.181
[Grace] It's hot!

07:47.181 --> 07:50.600
Place not cool enough for you now.

07:52.018 --> 07:54.687
[GRACE] I don't understand why you could not drop me first
before coming here.

07:54.687 --> 07:57.315
[SALEEM] No one said that you couldn’t just wait in the
truck though.

07:57.315 --> 07:59.900
You took the keys! I would have melted.

07:59.900 --> 08:05.447
I told you, I cant leave it idling in one spot. It’s
starting to act it’s age.

08:10.493 --> 08:13.496
Like owner, like truck.

08:18.918 --> 08:22.713
[SALEEM] Anyway, it's just two more...

08:36.642 --> 08:40.397
Hey! You see that?

08:41.397 --> 08:42.481
What?

08:42.481 --> 08:44.775
That girl, right there.
She’s like following us or something.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.485
It’s fine. She’s just doing her job.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.863
By following us around? What does she expect to happen?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.115
I don't know... people steal stuff.

08:52.115 --> 08:56.745
Obviously! But we don’t look like... you know

08:56.745 --> 09:00.290
Alright listen, just let it go. She's just doing her job

09:00.290 --> 09:03.293
I'm sure kids come in here and steal things all the time.

09:15.512 --> 09:17.264
[SALEEM] Why would you do that!
[GRACE] Stop!

09:17.264 --> 09:20.808
Grow some balls man, she was being
completely disrespectful.

09:20.808 --> 09:21.558
How?

09:21.558 --> 09:22.810
That was normal.

09:22.810 --> 09:25.438
Maybe for you and places like this.

09:25.438 --> 09:27.273
You’re so so flipping...

09:27.981 --> 09:30.984
Flipping?

09:30.984 --> 09:35.864
Wait what? I can't take you seriously.

09:37.782 --> 09:41.911
Oh come on! Don't be so "flipping" sensitive.

09:42.703 --> 09:47.458
Saleem! Don't gosh darn leave me here.

10:03.348 --> 10:05.100
Saleem wait.

10:06.016 --> 10:09.311
I need 10 dollars for cigarettes.

10:09.311 --> 10:13.857
I'm low on cash and I doubt this place has a card machine.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.511
Please don’t do that.

10:45.595 --> 10:46.637
What?

10:46.637 --> 10:49.640
Come on, please. You know what you’re doing.

10:58.732 --> 11:01.735
It’s like talking to a child.

11:06.614 --> 11:11.328
Okay, we're basically here. Just do me a favor and stay in
the truck for five minutes.

11:11.328 --> 11:14.121
I'll even leaving it on for you this time.

11:14.121 --> 11:20.835
Well well, what’s with the all this secrecy Mr. Saleem.

11:22.837 --> 11:27.342
I’m starving, do you have anything to munch on?

11:57.119 --> 11:59.163
Wow.

12:02.165 --> 12:05.377
Pretty...Whats going on here?

12:05.377 --> 12:08.421
Trying to organize for this wedding. Last minute scramble.

12:08.421 --> 12:11.299
Oh Saleem, congratulations.

12:11.299 --> 12:13.967
You never brought it up. You men never...
[SALEEM] No! No.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.179
No. It's my cousin's wedding.

12:17.555 --> 12:20.557
Geez, okay.

12:31.568 --> 12:35.238
So you’e going to?

12:36.406 --> 12:38.616
Wait here.

12:38.616 --> 12:41.619
Good.

12:42.119 --> 12:45.122
I guess you can keep this.

12:54.004 --> 12:58.843
[AUNTIE SAADIA] Saleem love, what took you so long?

12:59.885 --> 13:03.847
I almost had to sent your little cousin...

13:03.888 --> 13:05.807
and you know how that would have turned out.

13:05.807 --> 13:09.310
Sorry Auntie Saadia, I ran into...something.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.646
Well never mind.

13:10.646 --> 13:13.648
You came just in time, because we still have a lot to do.

13:13.648 --> 13:16.568
Auntie, I have to head out again to pick up Abeera.
[SAADIA] What!

13:16.568 --> 13:19.069
She did not come with you?

13:19.862 --> 13:21.947
I don't understand that child.

13:21.947 --> 13:25.534
She knows it’s tomorrow right? Of course she does.

13:25.534 --> 13:28.036
It's okay. I’m going back for her now.

13:28.328 --> 13:33.375
You both get raised the same way, same love.

13:33.375 --> 13:37.920
God knows I tried to knock some sense into
that girl once or twice.

13:45.051 --> 13:46.970
I said to wait in the truck!

13:46.970 --> 13:49.556
And I did, for over five minutes.

13:49.556 --> 13:52.559
Your shit truck started to vibrate
like crazy so I took it off.

13:52.559 --> 13:55.562
[SAADIA] Saleem? Who is this?

13:57.230 --> 14:00.441
She umm, she's my friend.

14:00.441 --> 14:02.026
Hello dear, Im Saadia.

14:02.026 --> 14:03.319
Hi, I'm Grace.

14:03.319 --> 14:06.071
It seems my nephew forgot his manners.

14:06.071 --> 14:08.407
Much to learn this one.

14:08.407 --> 14:12.410
He is a sweet boy. Are you coming tomorrow?

14:12.410 --> 14:16.331
I really would love to, but...

14:16.331 --> 14:20.376
I don’t think I have the proper outfit.
[SALEEM] Stop it!

14:20.834 --> 14:23.546
How do you kids know each other?

14:23.546 --> 14:25.673
[SALEEM] Umm, well...
[GRACE] Through a mutual encounter.

14:25.673 --> 14:27.216
Grace stop it!

14:27.216 --> 14:31.970
Oh Saleem relax. I was young too.

14:32.179 --> 14:33.639
Yeah Saleem!

14:33.639 --> 14:35.599
Sorry Auntie I really have to go.

14:35.599 --> 14:37.183
I think Abeera might be ready.

14:37.183 --> 14:40.019
Oh, okay. Well take care love.
[SALEEM] Okay.

14:40.019 --> 14:44.982
And remind your sister that she still
has to come today.

14:44.982 --> 14:47.984
No excuses.
[SALEEM] Okay. Will do.

14:48.402 --> 14:50.946
[GRACE] Nice meeting you!

14:50.946 --> 14:53.573
You feel just because you’re...
[GRACE] What!

15:01.623 --> 15:04.416
It’s okay baby.

15:04.416 --> 15:05.417
Stop that.

15:05.459 --> 15:07.753
Don't do that. Stop that! I know what you're doing.

15:07.753 --> 15:09.921
And I know who you are.

15:11.048 --> 15:16.386
Everyone has an expiration date, even sluts.

15:21.933 --> 15:24.935
You did not just say that!

15:24.935 --> 15:27.229
I didn’t say you were...
[GRACE] Oh come on Saleem.

15:27.229 --> 15:30.232
You said what you really think about me!

15:30.232 --> 15:33.235
Don’t pussy out now!

15:35.779 --> 15:39.115
Can we just, please...

15:48.207 --> 15:50.126
Fine.

15:50.126 --> 15:53.128
get in the fucking truck then.

16:29.287 --> 16:32.790
You know it’s not just what you said.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.877
I have been called a slut before.

16:35.877 --> 16:38.503
But you seem like you never even
said that word before.

16:38.503 --> 16:41.964
[SALEEM] I really didn’t...
[GRACE] It's fine.

16:58.355 --> 17:01.734
You know, you're kind of an asshole.

17:01.859 --> 17:05.779
[SALEEM] What?
[GRACE] You are an asshole.

17:06.363 --> 17:09.366
No I'm not, why would you say that.

17:09.366 --> 17:12.367
Because it's true.
[SALEEM] No it's not.

17:12.367 --> 17:16.413
You don't see me driving you around whole day.
I'm a nice guy and...

17:16.413 --> 17:19.415
Did you just say that?!

17:19.415 --> 17:22.126
"I'm a nice guy"

17:22.126 --> 17:25.756
That phrase is such a red flag for girls.

17:25.756 --> 17:29.676
You can't just self appoint yourself a nice guy, Saleem.
[SALEEM] Yeah but...

17:29.676 --> 17:33.262
It's either you're trying to convince yourself of something

17:33.262 --> 17:35.473
[SALEEM] No, that isn't...
[GRACE] Or...

17:35.473 --> 17:37.600
Or you actually think that.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.686
That you are a nice guys.

17:39.686 --> 17:45.022
That somehow you are morally superior to everyone else.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.566
And I'm the asshole.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.903
You get to say whatever you want and
somehow I'm the villian in all of this.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.278
[GRACE] Yes! Exactly.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.949
Just because you don't say something
doesn't mean you're nice.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.825
It's already in your brain.

17:55.825 --> 18:01.121
Just because you haven't said it just makes you a judgy
passive aggressive, asshole.

18:01.121 --> 18:05.250
Now verbal assholes, I can handle.
At least I know where they stand.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.460
But passive aggression on the other hand.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.170
Those guys are the worst.

18:09.170 --> 18:14.634
Two faced at best. Dangerous at their worst.

18:17.929 --> 18:19.138
And that's it.

18:19.138 --> 18:24.226
I'm just stuck with that lable from now on.
[GRACE] It seems so.

18:41.491 --> 18:46.872
Ignoring your general lack of human decency.

18:46.872 --> 18:50.625
As much as it hurts to admit, I guess you have a point.
[GRACE] That you're an asshole...

18:50.625 --> 18:52.669
[SALEEM] That...

18:52.669 --> 18:56.714
I can at times judge from a distance.

18:56.714 --> 18:58.925
And?

18:59.300 --> 19:03.178
And... Not everything is as it seems.

19:03.178 --> 19:06.181
Not at first anyhow.

19:08.726 --> 19:12.604
I should charge by the hour for this shit.

19:25.199 --> 19:28.202
[GRACE] Ahhh!

19:35.000 --> 19:37.210
Of course.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.879
I could have told you that.

19:43.173 --> 19:44.174
Oh jeez.

19:44.174 --> 19:45.676
It's fine.

19:45.676 --> 19:48.345
You need to pull over.
[SALEEM] What?

19:48.345 --> 19:51.348
You need to pull over now!

19:54.309 --> 19:57.311
Right here.

20:11.407 --> 20:14.494
Oh God are you serious?!
[GRACE] Oh shut up!

20:14.494 --> 20:18.748
I have been stuck in that piece of shit for 3 hours.

20:32.427 --> 20:34.054
[SALEEM] Wash your hands.

20:34.054 --> 20:36.849
What? Fuck you man.
(car revs)

20:38.182 --> 20:41.185
Don't you dare.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.941
[GRACE] I would of killed you.

20:55.032 --> 20:58.034
(stomach grumbles)

20:59.452 --> 21:03.205
[GRACE] Jordan Almonds are not food.

21:06.458 --> 21:11.463
So this was the food place I was telling you about, that is
the best on this side of Trinidad.

21:11.463 --> 21:14.507
In your expert knowledge of all things Trini food?

21:14.507 --> 21:19.470
Yes. Trust me. You'll love it.
[SALEEM] We'll see.

21:21.181 --> 21:22.473
Hey Angie.

21:22.473 --> 21:25.977
Hello sweetheart, How can I help you today?

21:25.977 --> 21:29.563
Can I get the meat lovers please.

21:29.563 --> 21:33.109
No skimping on the sauce.

21:33.109 --> 21:38.404
And he will have the pig tail right?

21:39.322 --> 21:43.326
He will have the fully loaded.
[CHLOE] Grace?

21:43.326 --> 21:49.498
[CHLOE] Oh my God!
[GRACE] Chloe!

21:49.498 --> 21:52.500
Look at you.
[GRACE] When did you get in?

21:52.500 --> 21:55.087
Just this morning. Straight from
the exam room to the airport.

21:55.087 --> 21:57.756
And you didn’t even call.

21:57.756 --> 22:01.301
Well we're heading over to Peters now.

22:01.301 --> 22:02.177
You have to come.

22:02.177 --> 22:03.887
Yes!
[CHLOE] Yes.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.681
Oh wait, sorry.

22:06.681 --> 22:12.728
I can pass by later for sure; but I’m here
with my friend now.

22:12.728 --> 22:15.313
That guy?

22:15.313 --> 22:18.358
My my things really have changed since I left.

22:18.358 --> 22:22.779
Noooo! Its not like that. He’s just giving me a ride.

22:22.779 --> 22:24.697
I bet he is.

22:24.697 --> 22:26.950
What?

22:27.659 --> 22:29.535
Why would you...

22:29.535 --> 22:33.873
Chlo you know my type, its not... that.

22:33.873 --> 22:37.000
Relax Im just joking. I know you would never.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.670
Anyway let me not keep you from your "friend"

22:39.670 --> 22:42.172
I’m seeing you later right?

22:42.172 --> 22:44.548
Yeah. Yeah for sure.
[CHLOE] For sure?

22:44.548 --> 22:45.175
For sure.

22:45.175 --> 22:47.970
Yes! Okay, it was so good to see you.

22:47.970 --> 22:48.511
You too.

22:48.511 --> 22:50.888
[GRACE] Bye.
[CHLOE] Bye.

23:09.614 --> 23:12.616
Ready?

23:12.700 --> 23:15.411
You know what. Lets just eat in the truck.

23:15.411 --> 23:19.081
You Princess? Eating in the piece of shit?

23:19.081 --> 23:23.127
I think I can manage.
[SALEEM] Okay.

23:44.521 --> 23:45.814
This is amazing!

23:45.814 --> 23:47.190
It’s good right?

23:47.190 --> 23:50.193
This is the best thing I ever had!

23:50.193 --> 23:53.196
Relax, it's just a hotdog.

23:54.281 --> 23:57.533
What's wrong?
[SALEEM] Is this Halal?

23:57.533 --> 24:00.535
Halal?

24:01.704 --> 24:06.250
[SALEEM] Wait didn't you go Convent and both of y'all
schools were fighting all the time?

24:06.250 --> 24:09.377
[GRACE] Yes! Convent versus Naps...

24:09.377 --> 24:11.504
[SALEEM] Oh shit!

24:45.452 --> 24:46.995
What's wrong with it?

24:46.995 --> 24:49.413
Looks like it overheated.

24:51.083 --> 24:54.086
I guess we really should not have
left it on at your aunts place.

24:54.086 --> 24:56.962
No it’s more this hot weather.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.965
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.593
You ready?

25:02.593 --> 25:04.136
For what?

25:04.136 --> 25:08.473
Well we have to get water.
There was a bar a bit up the road.

25:08.932 --> 25:11.310
Yeah but we cant walk there though,

25:11.310 --> 25:13.269
The sun is fucking hot as hell.

25:13.269 --> 25:18.358
Suit yourself, but its going to be a while
before I get back though.

25:19.525 --> 25:23.862
Yeah but, I cant walk in these. My feet are
already killing me.

25:23.862 --> 25:25.906
Hold on.

25:32.204 --> 25:35.540
There is no way.
[SALEEM] It's all I have.

25:56.559 --> 25:58.602
Hey.

25:58.602 --> 26:02.898
You think you can get us some drinks?
It has a card machine.

26:30.383 --> 26:33.427
[GUY AT BAR] Hey, sexy legs where you going...
[GRACE] You can't just touch people like that!

26:33.427 --> 26:36.679
What is your problem! You can't go around...

26:37.306 --> 26:40.309
Aye! Leave him alone!

28:06.887 --> 28:12.017
What do you want me to say?!

28:12.017 --> 28:14.979
I’m sorry. It wasn't my fault...
[SALEEM] Yeah.

28:14.979 --> 28:19.108
that’s your problem Grace! It’s never your fault.

28:19.108 --> 28:22.026
At the variety store, and oh, by my aunts house.

28:22.026 --> 28:25.029
[GRACE] Hold on.
[SALEEM] No, it’s like you need it!

28:27.991 --> 28:30.201
You like it.

28:30.201 --> 28:32.786
You love being treated differently.

28:32.786 --> 28:35.456
The way people look at you and
how you pretend not to notice.

28:35.456 --> 28:38.834
No, worse! You want to be noticed..

28:40.460 --> 28:46.258
You started every shitty situation we got into today...
[GRACE] Like you are such a fucking saint Saleem.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.260
You never had to take me home today.

28:48.260 --> 28:48.843
[SALEEM] Wow.

28:48.843 --> 28:51.846
So don’t pretend you didn’t like being
next to me all this time.

28:51.846 --> 28:56.559
For your family see you with a woman for a change.

28:59.020 --> 29:04.107
You know there is a reason why you have to try so hard for
that attention now right?

29:04.107 --> 29:08.903
Ugliness does eventually make its way to the surface
eventually, Grace.

29:09.279 --> 29:11.655
I feel sorry for you.

29:11.655 --> 29:15.242
Oh big man all of a sudden eh.

29:15.242 --> 29:18.370
You feel sorry for me?
[SALEEM] Yes I feel sorry for you!

29:18.370 --> 29:21.874
Your own sister does not even acknowledge your existence.

29:21.874 --> 29:23.625
Abee and I have been real good for three years now.

29:23.625 --> 29:27.170
How is it I never even heard of you up till today?

29:27.421 --> 29:30.591
And talking about how you used to hangout back in the day.

29:30.591 --> 29:33.801
I would have seen you around.

29:34.801 --> 29:39.265
You know what, no, I would not have.

29:39.515 --> 29:44.269
My friend picked you out as a loser from a mile away.

29:44.269 --> 29:47.898
You are a wallflower.

29:47.898 --> 29:53.110
Worse, you’re not even invited to the fucking party.

29:53.736 --> 29:56.739
You are a 40 year old virgin in the making.

29:56.739 --> 29:59.741
Why am I even here with you and your...

30:16.299 --> 30:19.301
Oh you going to kick me out your shitty...

32:41.182 --> 32:44.185
It’s flat.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.903
You want to see something cool?

32:56.947 --> 32:59.950
Like you won't believe.

34:09.096 --> 34:12.349
You know there are easier places to hide a body.

34:12.349 --> 34:15.476
Only the best for you.

34:23.943 --> 34:26.321
Wow.

34:26.321 --> 34:30.742
Saleem this is crazy.

34:31.826 --> 34:34.161
How did you find this place?

34:34.161 --> 34:38.456
Hold on, you have not seen the best part yet.

35:00.603 --> 35:05.231
You were right. This is really cool.

35:12.196 --> 35:15.199
Hey!?

35:15.449 --> 35:18.452
Saleem?

35:35.050 --> 35:39.889
The view is just part of it.

37:50.300 --> 37:55.013
Geez Saleem, took you long enough.
[SALEEM] Yeah.

37:55.222 --> 37:57.682
Grace?

37:57.682 --> 38:00.685
Wait, you two know each other?

38:38.679 --> 38:40.471
Ready sir?

38:40.471 --> 38:42.891
No, um. I’m waiting for my... friend?

38:42.891 --> 38:44.475
Water sir?

38:44.475 --> 38:46.978
I think I'll...

38:46.978 --> 38:48.312
Sparkling?

38:48.312 --> 38:52.149
No. Wait. I think I will have the other one.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.903
Oh.

39:01.157 --> 39:04.160
Okay sir, are we...

39:06.662 --> 39:09.665
Will your dining partner be joining us soon?

39:10.041 --> 39:12.459
I really hope so.

39:14.294 --> 39:16.755
Would you like to place an horsd’oeuvre order.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.298
Yeah.

39:18.298 --> 39:21.509
Perhaps something you both could share?

39:30.475 --> 39:33.478
Perhaps the Calamari, Sir.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.941
That’s usually the safe choice, a real crowd pleaser.

39:37.941 --> 39:38.942
Yeah.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.277
No wait.

39:41.445 --> 39:44.447
I want to try something different.

39:44.447 --> 39:48.409
I want tonight to be special.

39:49.827 --> 39:51.537
Oh I see.

39:51.537 --> 39:52.914
Something unexpected.

39:52.914 --> 39:54.832
Yeah, exactly.

39:54.832 --> 39:57.292
Well there’s always...

39:58.501 --> 40:00.879
but no, you won't want that.
[SALEEM] No, what?

40:00.879 --> 40:02.131
No no no sir.

40:02.131 --> 40:04.549
You must not go too far outside the comfort zone.

40:04.549 --> 40:06.635
It has to be Calamari, or some version of that.

40:06.635 --> 40:09.637
No, we could try something

40:09.637 --> 40:10.805
different, I mean

40:10.805 --> 40:15.309
What's wrong with going avant garde every once in a while.

40:18.812 --> 40:19.897
The Calamari then?

40:19.897 --> 40:20.731
Yes please.

40:20.731 --> 40:23.733
Great, be right with you sir.

40:24.275 --> 40:25.652
Wait!

40:29.572 --> 40:31.532
Yes... Sir?

40:31.824 --> 40:34.077
Is this too much?

40:34.077 --> 40:36.662
Giving what’s expected?

40:39.498 --> 40:41.500
Okay sir.

40:42.417 --> 40:45.419
What are you expecting from this evening?
[SALEEM] Nothing.

40:45.419 --> 40:47.421
I mean, I want to have a good time.

40:47.421 --> 40:49.507
No. That sounds wrong.

40:49.507 --> 40:52.510
I want, I want...

40:52.843 --> 40:54.345
You want your lady friend...

40:54.345 --> 40:57.347
How did you know?

40:59.474 --> 41:03.020
You want your lady friend to have a good time, yes?

41:05.647 --> 41:09.943
It started off rocky, to say the least,

41:09.943 --> 41:12.946
but ended on this really nice note.

41:12.946 --> 41:15.949
I’m afraid this chapter can’t compare.

41:20.953 --> 41:22.538
Sir

41:22.538 --> 41:29.585
Yes the initial meeting is always exciting.

41:29.585 --> 41:34.090
and in your case an unexpected journey.

41:34.090 --> 41:37.093
But look at this as a chance to do even better.

41:37.719 --> 41:41.222
Use that good will to create an experience

41:41.222 --> 41:43.515
no one is expecting.

41:43.515 --> 41:45.475
Yeah.

41:45.475 --> 41:46.977
Yeah.

41:46.977 --> 41:48.645
Waiter good Sir.

41:48.645 --> 41:50.897
This is not a blank page,

41:50.897 --> 41:53.900
it’s a progression of our story.

41:54.650 --> 41:57.653
I'm sure things will work out just gre...

41:57.737 --> 41:59.655
Grace.

42:23.635 --> 42:25.262
Good luck.

42:34.645 --> 42:37.190
Thank you.

42:40.943 --> 42:43.946
So, hello Mr. Saleem.

42:45.489 --> 42:46.990
Hello Grace.

42:48.575 --> 42:50.286
I could have picked you up you know.

42:50.286 --> 42:55.123
No it’s okay. Unlike that truck of yours my car works fine.

42:55.123 --> 42:58.126
But that’s what you do in these situations right?

42:59.044 --> 43:03.047
Typically. But we aren’t like everyone else are we.

43:03.047 --> 43:04.006
No.

43:04.673 --> 43:06.842
Plus your place is like ten minutes from here right?

43:06.842 --> 43:09.511
What’s the point in making another detour on my account.

43:09.511 --> 43:11.429
Haven't we had enough of that?

43:11.429 --> 43:13.265
For now.

43:13.807 --> 43:15.558
How's registration?

43:15.558 --> 43:18.353
Ugh, don’t remind me.

43:18.978 --> 43:23.900
Back in my day it was waiting in long lines
to hand in your papers,

43:23.900 --> 43:26.319
but now it’s website after website;

43:26.319 --> 43:29.321
GATE saying I did not submit this and that.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.951
Oh, I sound like an old woman!

43:33.951 --> 43:37.578
I’m going to be the weird geriatric in
everyone’s foundation classes.

43:37.578 --> 43:40.832
Well I hear the kids are into ‘milfs’ now.

43:40.832 --> 43:42.959
So maybe it’s for the best.

43:42.959 --> 43:45.044
Well well well, Saleem Khan.

43:45.044 --> 43:47.046
I’ve been corrupted by the best.

43:47.046 --> 43:49.382
You’re welcome.

43:52.426 --> 43:55.762
And I guess you can tell...

43:55.762 --> 43:58.431
this isn't my usual place.

43:59.598 --> 44:01.184
Well,

44:01.184 --> 44:04.437
I think you stick out wherever you go.

44:04.437 --> 44:06.730
In a good way.

44:08.649 --> 44:11.652
Have you decided on what your meal will be tonight?

44:23.037 --> 44:24.205
Sir?

44:24.205 --> 44:26.416
Almost.

44:26.790 --> 44:27.666
If I may.

44:27.666 --> 44:29.626
Just a second.

44:39.094 --> 44:42.097
I need a minute. I'm going to use the bathroom.

44:43.973 --> 44:45.016
Go do your thing.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.642
Of course sir.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.815
And what will you be having...
[GRACE] I will have the

44:53.815 --> 44:57.819
duck confit with a side of creamed spinach please.

44:57.819 --> 45:01.740
And bring me a glass of something red to go with it.

45:01.740 --> 45:04.242
I’ll leave it up to your discretion.

45:04.242 --> 45:05.784
Excellent choice mam.

45:05.784 --> 45:08.787
I’ll get to it right away.

45:20.132 --> 45:21.467
Jesus!

45:21.467 --> 45:23.051
Not quite sir.

45:23.051 --> 45:25.512
What are you doing here?

45:25.512 --> 45:27.138
Please.

45:33.186 --> 45:36.188
Sir. Please don’t take this the wrong way

45:36.188 --> 45:39.024
but, why don’t you accept your position?

45:39.024 --> 45:40.484
Sorry?

46:10.470 --> 46:12.721
As I was saying sir.

46:13.806 --> 46:17.643
Your dinner partner flows through this establishment
like she belongs,

46:18.519 --> 46:20.854
all signs indicating that she does,
[SALEEM] Yeah.

46:20.854 --> 46:22.855
While you sir.

46:23.274 --> 46:25.984
and I mean no offense,

46:25.984 --> 46:28.987
fall into this situation like a rock in water.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.698
No no no. Don’t misunderstand me.

46:31.698 --> 46:33.491
This is a compliment.

46:33.657 --> 46:36.327
You and your...

46:36.327 --> 46:39.997
non traditional features

46:41.290 --> 46:44.293
that poorly ironed shirt and your...

46:44.668 --> 46:45.752
Over the counter trousers.

46:45.752 --> 46:47.628
Good lord those trousers sir! How
[SALEEM] I...

46:47.628 --> 46:49.589
You know what, nevermind that.

46:53.134 --> 46:55.261
Have have pushed her away.

46:56.971 --> 46:59.515
She possesses a confident charm that

46:59.515 --> 47:05.020
some would assume a woman with her attributes would not have
the need to develop.

47:05.645 --> 47:07.939
Yet, there they are.

47:07.939 --> 47:09.649
That little something

47:09.649 --> 47:14.695
that never fades, even as external
beauty folds into aged grace.

47:14.695 --> 47:16.156
And yet

47:16.905 --> 47:20.159
she chooses to share this little something with you.

47:22.661 --> 47:25.663
So don’t fear this blossoming union,

47:25.663 --> 47:27.249
Embrace it.

47:27.249 --> 47:28.875
That...

47:29.585 --> 47:32.045
That, that was beautiful.

47:32.045 --> 47:33.254
Yeah.

47:34.005 --> 47:37.842
Yeah.
[WAITER] Now, Get back out there..

47:37.842 --> 47:40.094
and don’t Fuck it up.

47:40.094 --> 47:43.096
Yeah okay.

47:51.438 --> 47:53.398
Still never ordered.

47:55.317 --> 47:58.194
So punctual arrival, check.

47:58.194 --> 48:00.529
Witty banter, check and check.

48:00.529 --> 48:03.782
Don’t forget undercover handsome.
I heard that’s the best kind.

48:03.782 --> 48:07.869
Don’t make me get the bad list out.
[SALEEM] Okay.

48:09.245 --> 48:14.542
So according to the dating rules handed
down from high above...

48:14.542 --> 48:17.753
This new phase requires a change in conversation.

48:17.753 --> 48:21.006
from pleasantries to something deeper.

48:21.006 --> 48:23.884
Like life goals, favorite movies.

48:23.884 --> 48:26.095
Exactly, all that good stuff.

48:26.095 --> 48:28.514
Okay. Fine.

48:30.307 --> 48:31.724
Family?

48:31.724 --> 48:34.395
Oh geez Saleem, going with the heavy hitters already.

48:34.395 --> 48:36.771
But you said deeper!

48:36.771 --> 48:40.233
I’m just joking. What do you want to know.

48:40.942 --> 48:42.151
Parents?

48:42.151 --> 48:44.654
Yes; two of them like everyone else.

48:44.654 --> 48:46.738
Happily married 28 long years.

48:46.738 --> 48:49.741
And of course you're an only child.

48:49.741 --> 48:52.035
Yes how did you...

48:54.704 --> 48:56.415
...shut the fuck up.

48:56.415 --> 48:57.457
Fine.

48:57.457 --> 49:00.251
what’s the most embarrassing thing to happen to you?

49:00.251 --> 49:02.920
I mean curl up and die type stuff.

49:02.920 --> 49:04.797
I don’t know.

49:04.797 --> 49:06.966
Come on.

49:07.550 --> 49:09.260
Wait, yea. This is really funny.

49:09.718 --> 49:11.970
This is really funny.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.763
Form six graduation.

49:13.763 --> 49:15.683
Oh, this is going to be good.

49:15.683 --> 49:17.767
I wasn’t going to go or anything,

49:17.767 --> 49:22.771
but I got a random call from Alicia Vashti Cooblal.

49:22.771 --> 49:25.190
didn't even think she knew my name

49:26.024 --> 49:30.612
I answered and she asked me to go to the dance with her.

49:31.071 --> 49:32.406
I said yes.

49:32.573 --> 49:35.159
hung the phone up and immediately started panicking.

49:35.159 --> 49:38.620
Not the good kind of panicing, not the
excited kind but more like...

49:38.620 --> 49:40.539
Fear.

49:40.872 --> 49:43.374
Two weeks later I show up at her house

49:43.374 --> 49:48.837
with my blue corsage, matching the blue shirt
Abeerah told me to buy.

49:49.213 --> 49:52.215
Her dad answered the door and

49:52.340 --> 49:56.803
He says she already left with her boyfriend.

49:57.262 --> 49:58.722
Oh Saleem.

49:58.722 --> 50:00.848
No it’s okay.

50:00.848 --> 50:02.225
It's fine.

50:02.225 --> 50:04.436
Turns out she...

50:05.102 --> 50:08.105
was just asking me to get her boyfriend angry

50:08.105 --> 50:11.108
and never bothered to let me in on the plan.

50:24.037 --> 50:25.163
You know what!

50:25.163 --> 50:28.165
I’m going to call that bitch right now.

50:30.876 --> 50:32.587
What are you doing?

50:32.587 --> 50:35.589
You’re being very rude. I’m on the phone.

50:35.964 --> 50:37.633
Sorry.

50:38.759 --> 50:43.680
Oh, good evening. Is a miss Alicia Vashti Cooblal available.

50:43.680 --> 50:48.768
Oh, I’m sorry Mrs. Alicia Vashti Mohammed.

50:49.060 --> 50:51.145
Regarding what you ask?

50:51.145 --> 50:54.524
Oh, just an old friend.

50:54.524 --> 50:58.778
Okay. He’s getting her now.
[SALEEM] Okay.

50:59.361 --> 51:03.406
Oh hello Alicia. Alicia from...

51:04.616 --> 51:05.659
ASJA

51:05.659 --> 51:08.703
licia from ASJA Girls class of 2010.

51:08.703 --> 51:10.955
I’m sitting here with Saleem Khan,

51:10.955 --> 51:15.376
yes that Saleem, and we would love to tell you...

51:15.376 --> 51:16.710
Oh, what’s that?

51:16.710 --> 51:18.754
Worst decision of your life?

51:18.754 --> 51:21.674
Thrice divorced? And how many children?

51:21.674 --> 51:24.509
I didn’t think that was possible.

51:24.509 --> 51:27.512
Well we are calling to say...

51:28.429 --> 51:31.432
can’t hold down a job because of what?

51:31.432 --> 51:34.686
Oh noooo? That’s terrible.

51:35.269 --> 51:40.898
Well we were just calling to tell you go fuck yourself.

51:42.609 --> 51:44.778
Oh I’m sorry did you want to say something?

51:44.778 --> 51:49.115
No that was...

51:49.115 --> 51:50.950
Perfect.

52:27.942 --> 52:29.193
Umm

52:31.404 --> 52:33.323
I must apologize,

52:33.323 --> 52:36.909
there has been a slight ‘disturbance’

52:36.909 --> 52:38.745
in the kitchen.

52:38.745 --> 52:43.081
Your meals maybe a bit longer in preparation than usual.

52:43.081 --> 52:44.791
It’s okay.

52:46.084 --> 52:47.711
You okay?

52:48.085 --> 52:52.883
Ahhh Wine. Must be some really big disturbance.

52:52.883 --> 52:56.677
Oh no no no mam.

52:57.345 --> 53:00.348
Nothing out of the ordinary.
[GRACE] I’m surprised.

53:00.348 --> 53:05.060
a place like this could fall victim to a ‘disturbance’
of any kind.

53:05.060 --> 53:06.561
What do you think Saleem?

53:06.561 --> 53:08.688
Salmonella?

53:12.066 --> 53:13.902
Oh no!

53:13.902 --> 53:16.821
An establishment of this quality.

53:16.821 --> 53:19.824
I would guess something along the lines of...

53:19.824 --> 53:22.451
an illegal workforce,

53:23.452 --> 53:25.954
There is no...

53:25.954 --> 53:28.540
Interesting. Why not both?

53:28.540 --> 53:31.542
Takes a village right?
[GRACE] Yes.

53:38.716 --> 53:39.717
Your meals.

53:39.717 --> 53:44.262
I will check on the progress of your meals at once!

53:49.101 --> 53:50.894
You're evil.

53:51.937 --> 53:53.187
Was that mean?

53:53.187 --> 53:55.607
Depends how you look at it.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.483
So said Hitler I’m sure.

53:57.483 --> 54:01.445
That's right, accept your inner ass hole!

54:01.445 --> 54:04.865
Join me on the dark side.

54:06.575 --> 54:09.577
It doesn't mean you’re not a good guy.

54:29.346 --> 54:35.351
...and that’s how I learnt to never check the mail just
wearing a thong.

54:36.979 --> 54:38.604
What?

54:38.604 --> 54:40.815
just seeing if you were with me.

54:41.357 --> 54:44.360
Sorry. I’m just mentally tapped out.

54:45.193 --> 54:47.404
Okay.
[GRACE] No no no.

54:48.030 --> 54:50.950
Its just the natural trajectory of the night.

54:50.950 --> 54:53.160
The food was supposed to be here by now

54:53.160 --> 54:57.789
and we would say this is really great, you really have to
try this etc.

54:57.789 --> 55:01.625
But as you can see empty stomach and a clear table.

55:08.716 --> 55:10.718
This is me.

55:10.718 --> 55:13.721
And this is you.

55:14.220 --> 55:18.308
Hold on should it be the other way around

55:18.308 --> 55:21.311
I could ask for a beer bottle if it would make
you feel better.

55:21.311 --> 55:25.940
Oh shut up and continue with your clever little metaphor

55:27.232 --> 55:29.401
So THIS is me.
[GRACE] Yes.

55:29.401 --> 55:31.570
And This is you.

55:34.490 --> 55:36.282
Hey!

55:36.282 --> 55:38.201
Just trying to be accurate.

55:38.201 --> 55:42.080
Well that salt shakers a bit big if you ask me.

55:42.371 --> 55:45.374
Come on. I’m liking where this is going.

55:52.089 --> 55:53.590
I’m at a loss.

55:53.590 --> 55:55.425
You?

55:55.425 --> 55:58.678
Yea. I did not think this would require so much plot.

55:58.678 --> 56:01.138
Come, give me those.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.853
You are the salt.

56:08.145 --> 56:11.398
People don’t realize how much they need you,

56:11.398 --> 56:16.236
but you are always around and reliable

56:17.655 --> 56:20.657
so its easy to take you for granted.

56:22.700 --> 56:27.539
But if you are missing from a meal,
you bet people will notice.

56:29.833 --> 56:31.583
And I’m the pepper.

56:31.583 --> 56:34.503
People tend to not like me at first, but

56:34.503 --> 56:37.798
try to get rid of me when you get a taste for my burn.

56:41.677 --> 56:42.886
Grace!

56:43.971 --> 56:47.723
But when you mix them just right,

56:49.308 --> 56:51.310
they’re perfect.

56:55.022 --> 56:58.025
And who doesn’t like salt and pepper?

57:12.746 --> 57:15.749
I feel like we they definitely came after us.

57:16.333 --> 57:19.128
I know they came after us.

57:19.128 --> 57:22.131
Come on this is ridiculous.

57:23.631 --> 57:26.051
You want to dine and ditch?

57:27.468 --> 57:29.888
Well this will be just ditching right?
[SALEEM] No

57:29.888 --> 57:31.014
We got the wine.

57:31.014 --> 57:32.389
Which we never drank.

57:32.389 --> 57:34.017
Yea but we got it.

57:34.934 --> 57:36.144
Yeah.

57:38.021 --> 57:39.938
Oh but that poor waiter though.

57:39.938 --> 57:43.066
Yeah, I know maybe we should

57:43.942 --> 57:46.611
Oh shit I hear him coming.

57:48.487 --> 57:50.032
Wait.

58:13.970 --> 58:18.933
Again, I deeply apologize for the long wait.
I took the liberty of

58:22.268 --> 58:24.980
Good for you,

58:24.980 --> 58:27.983
good for you!

59:06.851 --> 59:09.854
Come on. Pick up! Pick up!

59:09.854 --> 59:10.855
Hey.

59:10.855 --> 59:12.399
Where the fuck are you?

59:12.399 --> 59:14.400
I'm here.

59:26.662 --> 59:28.789
Merry Christmas!

59:28.789 --> 59:29.832
Hey.

59:29.832 --> 59:31.624
Happy holidays.

59:31.624 --> 59:35.503
Come on. Just say it for me please.
[SALEEM] Fine.

59:36.129 --> 59:39.007
Merry Christmas and a lovely boxing day.

59:39.007 --> 59:40.675
Happy Santa?

59:40.675 --> 59:42.634
See was that so hard?

59:42.634 --> 59:44.137
Not too bad.

59:44.137 --> 59:46.222
You're just in a mood because of today.

59:46.222 --> 59:48.140
By 'mood' you mean terrified?

59:48.140 --> 59:49.975
You will be fine Saleem.

59:49.975 --> 59:51.768
Not to make you feel too nice

59:51.768 --> 59:54.104
but you're quite the charmer given time.

59:54.104 --> 59:56.273
That's the problem.

59:56.273 --> 59:58.191
This is my first time doing this.

59:58.191 --> 59:59.358
Well It’s not mine.

59:59.358 --> 1:00:01.194
So from personal experience I can tell you,

1:00:01.194 --> 1:00:04.572
it’s not as hard as you would think...
[SALEEM] You and your experience.

1:00:04.572 --> 1:00:07.908
Hey asshole I’m being supportive and stuff here.

1:00:07.908 --> 1:00:10.368
I know. I’m sorry.

1:00:10.368 --> 1:00:12.454
So we have a full day ahead yes?

1:00:12.454 --> 1:00:15.081
Yep. Two houses for the price of one.

1:00:15.081 --> 1:00:18.459
That's right. One and then the other.

1:00:19.376 --> 1:00:23.006
Okay, well do I wait outside for you or?
[GRACE] Umm

1:00:23.006 --> 1:00:25.049
Na. Just go ahead.

1:00:25.049 --> 1:00:26.008
You sure?

1:00:26.008 --> 1:00:29.970
Yes! Pull the band aid man.

1:00:29.970 --> 1:00:31.930
Okay.

1:00:34.724 --> 1:00:38.353
Hey. We got this.

1:00:39.645 --> 1:00:41.939
Hope so.

1:01:28.524 --> 1:01:33.112
Hi, merry chris, happy holidays sir. I’m Saleem.

1:01:33.112 --> 1:01:36.240
Well hello there partner.

1:01:36.240 --> 1:01:39.993
Of course, Gracey told us a lot about you.

1:01:39.993 --> 1:01:43.830
And while I appreciate the sir sentiment

1:01:43.830 --> 1:01:45.915
you can stick with Pete.

1:01:45.915 --> 1:01:47.375
But never Peter though.

1:01:47.375 --> 1:01:51.461
The misses only calls me that when she’s steaming.

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:46.180
Hey, I know you!

1:03:08.450 --> 1:03:10.618
Yep.

1:03:13.662 --> 1:03:17.166
the misses really went overboard this year.

1:03:17.166 --> 1:03:20.710
Not that I’m complaining,

1:03:20.710 --> 1:03:24.340
it really makes the homestead come to
life don’t you think Saleem?

1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:28.218
Yea, its really beautiful.

1:03:28.218 --> 1:03:30.762
Yeah.

1:03:30.762 --> 1:03:35.266
she really does have a way with pretty things.

1:03:35.266 --> 1:03:37.393
What about you Saleem?

1:03:37.393 --> 1:03:41.313
Do you mess with pretty things?

1:03:41.313 --> 1:03:43.106
What?

1:03:43.106 --> 1:03:48.070
Me, no um I would never mess with...

1:03:48.111 --> 1:03:51.572
You ever took a poke at creative endeavors?
[SALEEM] No!

1:03:51.572 --> 1:03:53.157
not really.

1:03:53.157 --> 1:03:55.910
You ever penetrate unexpected places?
[SALEEM] No!

1:03:55.910 --> 1:03:58.287
No.

1:03:58.828 --> 1:04:00.456
Well you should!

1:04:00.664 --> 1:04:03.083
Me and the misses

1:04:03.875 --> 1:04:07.879
try to visit somewhere new every year.

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:15.803
Yes. I did that.

1:04:15.803 --> 1:04:17.389
I did that.

1:04:17.389 --> 1:04:19.807
Merry Christmas my dear.

1:04:19.807 --> 1:04:21.934
And Merry Christmas to you Aunty.

1:04:21.934 --> 1:04:24.937
For a second I thought I broke into the wrong house.

1:04:24.937 --> 1:04:26.355
Oh don’t worry about them.

1:04:26.355 --> 1:04:29.358
Plenty more where they came from.

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:36.990
And these three terrors are Alia,

1:04:37.614 --> 1:04:40.033
Fasia... Frida...

1:04:40.033 --> 1:04:40.867
Anyway,

1:04:40.867 --> 1:04:46.665
if their mother would actually come by with them more often
to visit, this wouldn't happen.

1:04:46.665 --> 1:04:48.624
Anyway don't let me bore you.

1:04:48.624 --> 1:04:56.215
Let's go to the kitchen where all the action is.

1:05:07.976 --> 1:05:11.938
Aziza, don’t let them fellas whip you all again you know.

1:05:11.938 --> 1:05:14.941
We will never hear the end of it.

1:05:16.192 --> 1:05:20.779
And fellas don't cheat, I'm watching you all.

1:05:21.071 --> 1:05:23.991
Well Saleem

1:05:23.991 --> 1:05:30.830
this beauty here is my wife for almost three thirty years.

1:05:30.830 --> 1:05:32.207
Hi, nice to meet you.

1:05:32.207 --> 1:05:34.208
Nice to meet you Saleem

1:05:34.208 --> 1:05:39.213
And sitting to her right is her mother Elizabeth,

1:05:39.839 --> 1:05:43.301
It's Mama to you and me.

1:05:43.593 --> 1:05:46.596
Now who am I forgetting

1:05:55.686 --> 1:05:58.773
So the famous Saleem.

1:05:58.773 --> 1:06:00.191
Hey man. Nice to...

1:06:00.191 --> 1:06:02.068
Ah Big step?

1:06:02.068 --> 1:06:05.029
The first family gathering.

1:06:05.029 --> 1:06:05.613
I guess.

1:06:05.613 --> 1:06:08.157
You are not what I was expecting to be honest.

1:06:08.157 --> 1:06:10.825
The way she described you.
[PETER] Luke.

1:06:10.825 --> 1:06:12.411
Be nice.

1:06:12.411 --> 1:06:16.164
It’s okay. It’s okay uncle.

1:06:16.164 --> 1:06:18.875
Just introducing myself to Saleem.

1:06:18.875 --> 1:06:22.504
Have to look out for my baby cousin is all.

1:06:23.421 --> 1:06:27.007
There’s nothing like family,

1:06:27.007 --> 1:06:29.259
am I right Saleem?

1:06:29.259 --> 1:06:30.803
Yeah.

1:06:30.803 --> 1:06:32.845
Yes.

1:06:33.138 --> 1:06:35.224
Anyway,

1:06:35.224 --> 1:06:38.226
I think I will finish this off yonder.

1:06:39.852 --> 1:06:41.521
There is nothing

1:06:41.521 --> 1:06:44.649
like fresh air in your lungs

1:06:44.649 --> 1:06:49.487
While sucking on the teet of nature's best vino.

1:06:54.950 --> 1:06:57.953
c'est magnifique

1:07:06.335 --> 1:07:08.295
I'm sorry about that.

1:07:08.295 --> 1:07:11.298
That's my sister's kid.

1:07:11.298 --> 1:07:12.841
It's okay.

1:07:12.841 --> 1:07:18.471
She gets to fly god knows where with her new...

1:07:19.139 --> 1:07:21.474
Anyway.

1:07:21.474 --> 1:07:25.811
Saleem, please take a seat.

1:07:40.032 --> 1:07:41.452
Hi aunty.

1:07:41.452 --> 1:07:43.244
Nice to meet you.

1:07:43.244 --> 1:07:45.288
Hello Grace.

1:07:45.288 --> 1:07:50.876
I’m glad you could make it to our little get together.

1:07:53.754 --> 1:07:56.256
Can I help with anything?

1:07:58.300 --> 1:08:00.218
Of course.

1:08:01.219 --> 1:08:02.928
Join the line.

1:09:14.411 --> 1:09:18.415
Pete, you need some help? Please.

1:09:18.415 --> 1:09:21.627
It’s alright Saleem,

1:09:21.627 --> 1:09:23.754
Just going to use the bathroom.

1:09:23.754 --> 1:09:26.756
Thankfully that is a solo department for now.

1:09:37.850 --> 1:09:41.435
Your Ecarte is very good Mrs. Samuel.

1:09:41.435 --> 1:09:43.604
Actually it’s an En Pointe,

1:09:43.604 --> 1:09:46.608
but I’m impressed a young man even noticed.

1:09:49.318 --> 1:09:52.738
Sorry. Excuse me.

1:09:59.829 --> 1:10:01.330
Were you involved in dance?

1:10:01.330 --> 1:10:04.457
Oh no. Not the men in my family.

1:10:04.457 --> 1:10:07.377
But my sister was quite good.

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:11.172
Yea she really took to the contemporary style of ballet.

1:10:11.172 --> 1:10:12.549
Me too!

1:10:12.549 --> 1:10:13.800
Does she still practice?

1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.219
No, unfortunately not.

1:10:17.219 --> 1:10:19.513
She spent most of her life practicing it

1:10:19.513 --> 1:10:22.516
Then she just stopped. Normal for Abeerah I guess.

1:10:22.516 --> 1:10:25.143
Well she got further than my Gracey.

1:10:25.143 --> 1:10:29.648
Lord she would scream and scream.

1:10:29.648 --> 1:10:33.861
I truly believe that she learnt to walk just to run away
from the studio

1:10:33.861 --> 1:10:36.862
Sounds like Grace.

1:10:38.071 --> 1:10:41.074
She really is strong headed isn’t she?

1:10:42.284 --> 1:10:44.829
It’s a good quality.

1:10:44.952 --> 1:10:47.956
Speaking of, where..?

1:10:49.625 --> 1:10:53.294
Sorry, I’m just going to take this really quickly.

1:10:53.294 --> 1:10:56.297
Where’s your washroom?
[FIONA] It's around the corner.

1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:00.593
Hey.

1:11:00.593 --> 1:11:01.927
Where the fuck are you?!

1:11:01.927 --> 1:11:03.888
I’m here.

1:11:03.888 --> 1:11:07.264
You’re not here, cause I’m fucking here

1:11:07.264 --> 1:11:11.144
with your army of, I’m sorry, but super mean aunties, and
you’re nowhere to be seen.

1:11:11.144 --> 1:11:13.605
Wait, you’re by my house?

1:11:13.605 --> 1:11:16.316
Yes Saleem! How slow are you driving?

1:11:16.316 --> 1:11:19.318
I’m by your family now.

1:11:19.443 --> 1:11:20.779
Why?!

1:11:20.779 --> 1:11:22.529
That was the plan.

1:11:22.529 --> 1:11:25.366
How the hell was that the plan?

1:11:25.366 --> 1:11:26.991
You said pull the bandaid.

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:27.743
Your words.

1:11:27.743 --> 1:11:30.412
That makes no sense.

1:11:30.412 --> 1:11:32.163
It kind of does.

1:11:33.582 --> 1:11:36.835
Just get your ass here before I look even worse!

1:11:37.377 --> 1:11:38.920
I’m sure you’re freaking out too.
[SALEEM] Well

1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:41.422
actually your dad has been really nice,

1:11:41.422 --> 1:11:44.842
OH, and your mom, she likes me so...

1:11:46.050 --> 1:11:49.054
But you are right, be there soon.

1:11:49.054 --> 1:11:50.889
You better.

1:12:10.574 --> 1:12:12.242
There you are.

1:12:12.242 --> 1:12:14.577
Can you help me with something?

1:12:14.577 --> 1:12:16.329
Well actually I just got off the phone with Grace...

1:12:16.329 --> 1:12:18.665
Okay great.

1:12:39.934 --> 1:12:42.937
There’s nothing like these,

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:45.898
do you want a taste?

1:12:45.898 --> 1:12:47.817
Really takes you back to those wide open plains.

1:12:47.817 --> 1:12:50.318
Yea thanks.

1:12:50.318 --> 1:12:55.157
Actually no. Not sure why I said that. I don’t smoke.

1:12:56.992 --> 1:12:59.286
I respect that.

1:12:59.286 --> 1:13:03.623
A man has to live long enough to take care of his kin.

1:13:10.296 --> 1:13:12.423
You work with your hands a lot?

1:13:12.423 --> 1:13:14.759
Yeah, woodworking.

1:13:14.759 --> 1:13:16.886
Good.

1:13:16.886 --> 1:13:19.262
Good.

1:13:21.014 --> 1:13:25.434
Yeah. I miss those days.

1:13:25.434 --> 1:13:29.396
when men weren't afraid to be men, you know?

1:13:29.939 --> 1:13:35.152
Building, hunting, et cetera.

1:13:35.152 --> 1:13:36.110
et cetera.

1:13:36.110 --> 1:13:38.196
you do any woodworking or anything like that?

1:13:38.196 --> 1:13:40.741
Me? God no!

1:13:45.077 --> 1:13:47.663
I am...

1:13:47.663 --> 1:13:50.666
I’m an accountant.

1:13:51.249 --> 1:13:52.877
But those were the days,

1:13:52.877 --> 1:13:54.045
Yeah.

1:13:54.544 --> 1:13:57.547
men being men.

1:13:57.714 --> 1:13:59.716
men being men.

1:14:10.684 --> 1:14:12.228
Grace.

1:14:12.228 --> 1:14:16.023
could you please take this to the dining room.

1:14:16.023 --> 1:14:17.066
Sure.

1:14:17.066 --> 1:14:20.193
place it just to the left of the beef ham,

1:14:20.193 --> 1:14:21.611
but not too close,

1:14:21.611 --> 1:14:24.073
oh!, and leave room for the salad,

1:14:24.073 --> 1:14:26.657
That goes right after the rice.

1:14:26.657 --> 1:14:29.661
Okay, I think I got it.

1:15:07.236 --> 1:15:08.822
Hello.

1:15:09.446 --> 1:15:12.449
Oh I’m really sorry.

1:15:12.616 --> 1:15:16.662
Is this the West Indies tour of England of umm... 1984?

1:15:16.662 --> 1:15:19.205
Yes, yes it is.

1:15:19.205 --> 1:15:21.041
Who are you?

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:25.420
Grace, I’m really sorry for the interrupt.

1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:27.463
The Grace?

1:15:27.463 --> 1:15:29.340
I’m a Grace, yes.

1:15:29.340 --> 1:15:33.177
Please put that down before your arms break off.

1:15:33.177 --> 1:15:33.969
Thanks.

1:15:33.969 --> 1:15:38.057
Not sure how much longer I could have lasted.

1:15:38.057 --> 1:15:41.268
A lot of mouths to feed out there.

1:15:41.268 --> 1:15:45.271
My wife does tend to prepare for an army.

1:15:45.689 --> 1:15:48.901
Oh my god, very nice to meet you.

1:15:50.484 --> 1:15:53.030
[MUSTAPHA] Come on!
[GRACE] Hurts every time!

1:15:53.821 --> 1:15:56.574
Please sit, sit.

1:15:58.282 --> 1:16:03.330
So, how you making out in the trenches?

1:16:13.380 --> 1:16:15.257
Um, Peter,

1:16:15.257 --> 1:16:17.010
Sorry. I mean Pete.

1:16:17.010 --> 1:16:18.302
What’s that Saleem?

1:16:18.302 --> 1:16:21.889
Should we be heading back in? Maybe they need some help or..

1:16:21.889 --> 1:16:23.307
No.

1:16:25.391 --> 1:16:26.602
No.

1:16:28.187 --> 1:16:31.190
Let the women gab for a bit longer.

1:16:36.235 --> 1:16:39.237
You do know you’re the first she’s brought home?

1:16:42.116 --> 1:16:43.993
No she...

1:16:43.993 --> 1:16:44.826
Well...

1:16:44.826 --> 1:16:46.745
She said she wasn’t new to this whole

1:16:46.745 --> 1:16:48.205
bringing home boys

1:16:48.205 --> 1:16:51.750
Not like she’s been with man a lot of... Plenty umm

1:16:51.750 --> 1:16:54.044
It’s okay Saleem.

1:16:54.543 --> 1:16:57.546
I know my Gracey is not perfect.

1:16:58.673 --> 1:16:59.924
Right.

1:17:00.549 --> 1:17:04.053
Beauty of her mother and head like father's.

1:17:08.514 --> 1:17:09.724
Yeah.

1:17:11.184 --> 1:17:14.980
But I have noticed a change in her over the last few months.

1:17:18.191 --> 1:17:18.900
Yeah?

1:17:18.900 --> 1:17:20.026
Yeah.

1:17:21.610 --> 1:17:24.612
There’s a calmness to her now.

1:17:27.241 --> 1:17:29.409
You make her happy,

1:17:30.368 --> 1:17:32.788
and I’m happy for that.

1:17:32.788 --> 1:17:34.621
Thanks Pete.

1:17:37.458 --> 1:17:39.127
And listen.

1:17:47.718 --> 1:17:53.389
I don’t have to express what happens if
her happiness should suddenly

1:17:53.389 --> 1:17:55.391
expires do I?

1:17:55.391 --> 1:17:58.769
No I understand.

1:18:00.855 --> 1:18:03.983
And if I know my little Gracey, she can be
a real firecracker.

1:18:03.983 --> 1:18:04.984
Yea,

1:18:04.984 --> 1:18:11.323
Grace, she can handle herself anywhere.

1:18:18.163 --> 1:18:19.873
Great match.

1:18:19.873 --> 1:18:22.374
The best match.

1:18:24.127 --> 1:18:27.421
Still quiet out there.

1:18:27.421 --> 1:18:30.799
May have time for some highlights.

1:18:31.925 --> 1:18:35.594
What about... the match.

1:18:35.594 --> 1:18:38.723
Which 'The match' are you speaking about exactly.

1:18:38.723 --> 1:18:41.017
What else uncle? Lara.

1:18:41.017 --> 1:18:42.434
Best there ever was!

1:18:42.434 --> 1:18:45.063
So young, so so wrong.

1:18:45.063 --> 1:18:47.023
Come on OLD MAN.

1:18:47.023 --> 1:18:47.940
Ahhh.

1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:50.817
There are matches past the 1980s you know.

1:18:50.817 --> 1:18:54.737
Won by players born after those games were long done.

1:18:54.737 --> 1:18:56.531
True but

1:18:56.531 --> 1:18:59.117
tapes are expensive

1:18:59.117 --> 1:19:01.660
and why waste money on that.

1:19:01.660 --> 1:19:06.291
You know, Saleem is always a generation
behind on everything but

1:19:06.291 --> 1:19:08.626
even he doesn't use tapes anymore.

1:19:08.626 --> 1:19:11.629
Ahh Saleem.

1:19:11.670 --> 1:19:14.589
Always right on time,

1:19:14.589 --> 1:19:20.678
even when I begged him to just hold on one more day.

1:19:20.678 --> 1:19:23.681
Right 84!

1:19:23.681 --> 1:19:24.974
Good year to be born,

1:19:24.974 --> 1:19:26.101
cricket wise.

1:19:26.101 --> 1:19:27.769
Great year for me.

1:19:27.769 --> 1:19:29.228
I became a man.

1:19:29.228 --> 1:19:30.978
‘I became a man’.

1:19:30.978 --> 1:19:32.398
It’s true.

1:19:32.398 --> 1:19:36.735
Freshly married, first real job,

1:19:37.111 --> 1:19:40.655
And Saleem came into our lives

1:19:40.655 --> 1:19:44.909
made us a family.

1:20:01.591 --> 1:20:02.884
Well Saleem,

1:20:02.884 --> 1:20:04.761
that sound tells me it’s that time.

1:20:04.761 --> 1:20:05.929
Lets dig in.

1:20:05.929 --> 1:20:07.638
Be right with you.

1:20:07.638 --> 1:20:10.641
I want to check on Grace again.

1:20:11.058 --> 1:20:12.643
Good man.

1:20:55.349 --> 1:20:59.353
Hey I thought I was supposed to meet you at my house.

1:21:01.605 --> 1:21:02.689
Ouch.

1:21:02.689 --> 1:21:03.523
You left me!

1:21:03.523 --> 1:21:05.150
You hit me... Hard

1:21:05.150 --> 1:21:06.651
Yes, yes I did.

1:21:06.651 --> 1:21:07.736
And I did not leave you.

1:21:07.736 --> 1:21:11.323
Okay okay. Let’s agree... mistakes were made.

1:21:11.323 --> 1:21:12.115
Yes.

1:21:12.115 --> 1:21:13.824
How was it?

1:21:15.117 --> 1:21:16.869
That bad?

1:21:16.869 --> 1:21:18.037
I met your dad.

1:21:18.037 --> 1:21:19.288
Yeah?

1:21:19.288 --> 1:21:20.623
And your mom.

1:21:20.623 --> 1:21:22.166
Oh.

1:21:22.665 --> 1:21:25.668
But I figure they make a good balance.

1:21:26.085 --> 1:21:29.088
So tell me, how terrible was your day?

1:21:29.088 --> 1:21:32.675
Not terrible. I was quite the charmer if I do say so myself.

1:21:32.675 --> 1:21:34.177
Do I have to hit you again?

1:21:34.177 --> 1:21:37.596
Won’t change the fact that I hit it off with your parents.

1:21:37.596 --> 1:21:39.307
Both of them.

1:21:39.389 --> 1:21:40.724
Mummy too?

1:21:40.724 --> 1:21:44.186
Yea! Just talked about ballet, you know, the usual.

1:21:44.186 --> 1:21:45.728
You sly devil.

1:21:45.728 --> 1:21:48.398
You said it, not me.

1:21:48.398 --> 1:21:49.898
[GRACE] Anyway.
[SALEEM] One more thing.

1:21:49.898 --> 1:21:51.026
What's that?

1:21:51.026 --> 1:21:53.736
Your cousin. He’s...

1:21:53.736 --> 1:21:57.615
What? Luke. He's the best.

1:21:57.615 --> 1:22:01.285
Yeah. He really did not um, like me there?

1:22:01.285 --> 1:22:03.995
No. He’s just being protective.

1:22:03.995 --> 1:22:05.414
Well he...

1:22:05.414 --> 1:22:09.291
When we were kids we used to say we would get married.

1:22:13.838 --> 1:22:16.091
So what’s the plan now?

1:22:16.091 --> 1:22:18.717
We go back?

1:22:19.552 --> 1:22:21.929
We go to your place?

1:22:21.929 --> 1:22:23.556
Well we cant stay here.

1:22:23.556 --> 1:22:26.558
Oh just shut up.
