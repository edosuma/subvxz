00:08.560 --> 00:12.960
This is Norway in the 21st century.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.960
A land built on democratic values,
such as:

00:20.039 --> 00:23.000
Tolerance.

00:23.079 --> 00:25.440
Diversity.

00:25.519 --> 00:28.120
Different,

00:28.199 --> 00:30.879
but equal.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.000
This is the present.

00:33.079 --> 00:35.119
An inclusive time.

00:45.679 --> 00:50.759
Didn't you say that Christianity
still is the religion in Norway ?

00:50.840 --> 00:54.079
I know this is a lot to take in...

00:54.159 --> 00:56.200
Listen, woman !

00:56.280 --> 01:00.079
A real Christian
doesn't bow his head for sinners !

01:00.159 --> 01:02.039
- Sinners ?
- We're Christian men !

01:02.119 --> 01:06.239
Unfortunately, that's everything
we've got time for today.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.680
Are you okay ?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.359
I had a memory.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.920
Do you have something called
a phone in this time ?

01:46.680 --> 01:49.959
- Who is he calling ?
- I have no idea.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.560
Hi ?

01:56.920 --> 02:00.719
Hi, this is Madeleine.
Please leave a message.

02:03.599 --> 02:06.879
Hello. It's me.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.759
Now I remember everything.

03:15.759 --> 03:17.159
Hi, there !

03:17.919 --> 03:20.560
You're already out of bed ?

03:22.759 --> 03:27.120
- What the hell is that ?
- The halibut we found by the timehole.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.800
We were on the water yesterday ?

03:33.879 --> 03:37.000
Yes.
But the halibut was a dead end.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.439
It died of natural causes.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.439
By the way, do you have
some hair gel I can borrow ?

03:43.520 --> 03:46.599
I think Ingrid has some
in the bathroom.

03:58.199 --> 04:02.879
Who's this woman ? Was it her Ada
was in touch with in Geilenkirchen ?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.199
Of course.

04:07.039 --> 04:11.199
- There is something familiar...
- You don't see it.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.240
Fuck, I'm late for my Tinder date.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.920
Okay.
I'll make it a bit easier for you.

04:48.639 --> 04:50.959
The woman's name is Mariana Werner.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.800
She has been affiliated
with a Neo- Luddite group in Aachen.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.800
As she is a technosceptic,

04:56.879 --> 05:01.560
we don't have any biometric data
on her, so identification is difficult.

05:01.639 --> 05:06.800
Why do you think she's the victim ?
Did you google look-a-likes ?

05:06.879 --> 05:10.519
- The tip came from Haaland.
- That's reassuring.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.160
Is she even reported missing ?

05:13.240 --> 05:16.600
Not officially, but according to Lars,
on the interweb...

05:16.680 --> 05:20.240
- The interweb ?
- There's no need for sarcasm.

05:20.319 --> 05:23.040
What's our approach ?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.399
We know where
the woman lived.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.720
This is a list of local
medical centres.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.519
If we find anyone who treated her,
we can get a match.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.399
We're supposed to call
hundreds of German doctors ?

05:35.480 --> 05:39.720
- This is madness.
- No, Wenche, this is police work.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.800
- So, have you confirmed her identity ?
- No, not yet.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.720
How did you find this Mariana ?

05:51.800 --> 05:55.920
We tried to track down the one
Ada mentioned on the audio tape.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.879
The one who contacted Ada
in Geilenkirchen, remember ?

05:59.959 --> 06:04.920
Mariana popped up as a candidate, and
we noticed the striking resemblance.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
- You say "we" ?
- Yeah.

06:08.079 --> 06:10.720
I've worked with this guy
after my resignation.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.519
What guy ? Is he connected
to the department, too ?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.720
He claims not to be.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.360
What's his name ? I need a name
for the report to management.

06:25.839 --> 06:30.480
I don't know. But he's Norse.
And he arrived with the first group.

06:33.399 --> 06:39.160
Bearded guy, in his forties.
You'll find him in the arrival file.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.959
- Is everything okay, Lars ?
- Yeah. Of course.

07:23.079 --> 07:24.800
NAME: Kalv TorbjÃ¸rnsen
TIME OF ORIGIN: Norse

07:24.879 --> 07:28.160
CAUSE OF DEATH: Traffic accident

07:36.079 --> 07:39.959
- Hi, Lars.
- Hi. I need more drops.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.120
- I have stopped.
- What ?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.720
Done.

07:45.439 --> 07:48.879
- Are you joking ?
- No dripping with Heart in the house.

07:53.959 --> 07:58.480
Listen, Lars.
How much do you use all in all ?

07:58.560 --> 08:03.560
- That's none of your business.
- It's time for a drop stop, my friend.

08:03.639 --> 08:05.040
You're not my friend.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.959
What message do you bring, shaman ?

08:25.759 --> 08:31.319
I think you have me confused
with someone else. I'm no shaman.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.159
I'm...

08:39.240 --> 08:41.360
Looking for drops.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.799
Of course you need your tool.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.440
But you won't find that here anymore.

08:50.679 --> 08:52.679
The drop crew moved on.

08:54.039 --> 08:55.960
Where are they now ?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.919
Dad ?

10:12.200 --> 10:16.159
- What are you doing here ?
- We need to have a serious talk, Lars.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.759
If you want to talk,
leave my daughter out of it.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.759
Stop it, dad.

10:26.840 --> 10:30.200
Look at yourself. What's happened ?

10:30.279 --> 10:32.879
Is it true
that you've been hallucinating ?

10:35.759 --> 10:36.759
No.

10:37.799 --> 10:40.200
No, of course not.

10:40.279 --> 10:45.799
Your acquaintance, the missionary,
or whatever you name him.

10:46.799 --> 10:51.039
He's my source.
He gave me all the info, and...

10:51.120 --> 10:54.080
I checked the database.

10:54.159 --> 10:56.679
The man died two years ago.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.039
He probably works
for the security service

11:04.120 --> 11:06.200
and faked his death certificate.

11:06.279 --> 11:08.559
Dad, look.

11:08.639 --> 11:11.960
One of your neighbours
filmed you in the hallway.

11:12.600 --> 11:17.559
No, I don't want to ! Stop it !

11:17.639 --> 11:19.879
No ! Stop it !

11:23.799 --> 11:29.759
I live here ! I decide who
gets to come inside ! Okay ?

11:32.679 --> 11:37.840
Hey ! How do you know
who I'm working with ?

11:41.159 --> 11:43.919
Give me what you've got
in your jacket.

12:10.879 --> 12:15.080
Lars, drink this.

12:15.159 --> 12:19.240
- It chases the drop sorrow.
- Okay.

12:22.759 --> 12:24.440
Drink all of it.

12:25.759 --> 12:30.200
Could the woman have been looking into
the timehole when she was killed ?

12:30.279 --> 12:33.240
That's possible.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.799
But if I'm going to
get rid of the drops,

12:36.879 --> 12:41.720
I think I'll have to step down
from the case for a while.

12:41.799 --> 12:44.879
Yes. That's correct. A break.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
I wish I had better news, but...

13:05.879 --> 13:08.840
How long do I have ?

13:08.919 --> 13:14.559
If we get started with the radiation,
you could have several good years left.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.559
- What are we waiting for ?
- Fuck me !

13:23.960 --> 13:25.919
Can't I skip that
radiation bullshit ?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.799
You heard what he said !

13:28.440 --> 13:30.440
He said that I'm dying.

13:30.519 --> 13:36.200
Either quickly,
or slowly and painfully.

13:36.799 --> 13:41.000
- I'm choosing quickly.
- No, you won't. You'll fight !

13:42.679 --> 13:44.919
And what am I fighting for ?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.240
To sit around and reminisce
about the past at Nivlhel

13:48.320 --> 13:50.120
for another summer or two ?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.879
You'll start treatment now.
End of discussion !

13:52.960 --> 13:54.480
Fuck me !

14:16.240 --> 14:19.480
I understand
that it's a lot to take in.

14:30.759 --> 14:36.279
Did you hear that we're invited
to Tore's migration day next week ?

14:45.039 --> 14:48.519
I can pick you up
and we can go together.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.360
To get outside upcleared is easy.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.919
To get inside upcleared...

15:24.039 --> 15:27.200
Now that's a different hoop of herring.

15:27.279 --> 15:31.559
I do agree with what you suggested,
but isn't it too soon ?

15:31.639 --> 15:35.919
No. It's never too soon
for right-doing.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.120
Yes ?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.559
- Oh, you have guests.
- Yes.

15:52.639 --> 15:54.720
This was a mistake.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.759
Who is that ?
Did he come with you ?

15:59.840 --> 16:01.600
Yeah.

16:01.679 --> 16:05.440
This thing was his idea, kind of.

16:07.519 --> 16:10.679
- Ok ?
- I'm trying to get clean.

16:14.679 --> 16:18.039
- He thought I should start with you.
- Start with what ?

16:21.799 --> 16:23.039
The idea is to say sorry.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.480
Both for what happened
with the girls

16:29.559 --> 16:32.559
and for the unforgivable stuff
I said to Gregers.

16:32.879 --> 16:35.919
- That's his voice ?
- Yes. Don't interrupt his whist club.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.960
He was inconsolable for days
after your visit.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.679
But I...

16:46.080 --> 16:50.279
I shouldn't have come here.
Sorry I bothered you.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.440
Lars, wait.

16:55.720 --> 17:01.519
I'll tell Gregers that you stopped by.
He'll appreciate that.

17:08.839 --> 17:12.240
Hi ! What are you doing here ?

17:15.200 --> 17:20.200
I just talked to Marie about stuff.

17:21.359 --> 17:25.039
How were things at Madeleine's ?
Is she feeling better ?

17:25.119 --> 17:28.519
Yeah, she's doing better.

17:28.599 --> 17:32.759
- But tell your colleagues to relax.
- What do you mean ?

17:34.039 --> 17:39.680
Two police officers showed up at school
asking questions. Madde freaked out.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.680
What police officers ?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.480
Hi ! Everything okay ?

18:11.559 --> 18:15.279
Yes, I'm here about the case.

18:15.359 --> 18:20.359
- Weren't you taking a break ?
- Yeah, I was going to but something...

18:22.599 --> 18:24.599
Does this mean
that you've found her ?

18:24.680 --> 18:26.440
Wenche got lucky in Cologne.

18:26.519 --> 18:29.279
A doctor had treated her
for pneumonia,

18:29.359 --> 18:32.880
and the Lego brick
was visible in the X-rays.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.319
What did you want to talk about ?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.519
Do you remember your first day ?

18:41.599 --> 18:44.920
When we met Jeppe and David
in the harbour shed ?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.240
- Like it was yesterday.
- Jeppe had a tetanus shot.

18:49.319 --> 18:54.519
He told us he'd been scratched
by a migrant the weekend before.

18:54.599 --> 18:58.839
- That happens all the time.
- Maybe so.

18:58.920 --> 19:03.400
But I checked the rosters. Jeppe
and David weren't on duty that weekend.

19:10.599 --> 19:13.160
You don't think they're involved ?

19:13.240 --> 19:16.799
It's conspicuous
that they're not telling the truth.

19:18.759 --> 19:24.079
Ingrid said they've been to her school,
asking about Madeleine.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.119
Then I thought of something.

19:30.200 --> 19:35.000
Didn't you get an MMS
of Jeppe's crotch area ?

19:35.079 --> 19:37.920
We can check if the injury he
mentioned is visible on the photo.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.440
Do you have it ?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.720
So you want to see my dick picks ?

19:43.799 --> 19:50.759
I don't need to see the whole thing,
just zoom in on the area in question.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.240
Shit !

19:53.319 --> 19:54.960
This looks like a bite mark.

19:58.519 --> 19:59.759
Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.079
Why would he lie about that ?

20:05.880 --> 20:10.039
One explanation is that it's from
the woman at Tjuvholmen.

20:14.599 --> 20:17.279
The woman biting the murderer
is news to us.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.440
Would you be able to find
the murderer's blood in her teeth ?

20:22.519 --> 20:26.680
If she actually bit him,
I'd say that's very likely.

20:26.759 --> 20:31.440
She's had her fillings removed,
so blood could get stuck in there.

20:31.519 --> 20:34.440
In that case,
we've nailed the bastard ?

20:35.720 --> 20:38.079
Is your suspect in the database ?

20:38.599 --> 20:41.200
No, he has no prior convictions.

20:41.279 --> 20:44.839
Then we'll need a court order
to reveal the DNA results.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.240
How long does a man-seed
live inside a woman ?

20:53.799 --> 20:56.720
- Don't you know ?
- Where are you going with this ?

20:56.799 --> 21:00.680
Are you planning on
extracting sperm from the murderer ?

21:00.759 --> 21:03.400
The harvest is already taken care of.

21:16.519 --> 21:17.519
Alfhildr !

21:19.839 --> 21:22.279
What on earth is Haaland doing here ?

21:22.359 --> 21:26.519
He's sober. He will assist us
during his notice period.

21:26.599 --> 21:29.599
You can't make that decision
without me.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.079
Forget my human resources policy.
Do you want to hear what we found ?

21:55.279 --> 21:59.559
You are under arrest
for the murder of Mariana Werner.

22:01.079 --> 22:03.119
Who's Mariana Werner ?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.000
Alfhildr ? What's going on ?

22:09.799 --> 22:13.839
You mentioned that you were
attacked by a migrant

22:13.920 --> 22:16.319
the last weekend of August.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.880
But according to the rosters,
you weren't on call then.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.039
Those rosters are a mess.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.119
But why did you try to hide
that your injury was a bite mark ?

22:28.200 --> 22:31.720
I'm not hiding anything.
I've been an open book to you.

22:35.599 --> 22:37.400
DNA will expose your lies.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.960
I'll tell you something
about DNA, my little Viking.

22:43.480 --> 22:48.200
If you want my DNA,
you need probable cause.

22:49.680 --> 22:53.440
- And you don't have that.
- I have something much better.

22:54.119 --> 22:57.359
- What's that ?
- I have your man-seeds.

23:21.839 --> 23:23.680
What did the Major say ?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.440
He says that we have no choice.

23:30.599 --> 23:35.000
The two officers have explained
that they contributed to prostitution,

23:35.079 --> 23:39.599
and killed Mariana Werner to stop her
from notifying authorities about it.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.599
What's the status
on prosecution of the officers ?

23:42.680 --> 23:46.519
We expect an indictment
by the end of the week.

23:46.599 --> 23:50.599
Was it Eriksen's multitemporal
team of investigators

23:50.680 --> 23:52.920
that made the breakthrough ?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.640
Yes, it was.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.680
If this case has taught us anything,

23:57.759 --> 24:03.240
it's that our department is at its best
when we work together,

24:03.319 --> 24:08.319
across temporal lines.
That's when we get results.

24:12.920 --> 24:18.720
The police also issued an APB
for a woman named Trine Syversen.

24:18.799 --> 24:23.359
She is supposedly a friend of the woman
who was killed by the prostitution ring

24:23.440 --> 24:26.559
that was exposed by the police today.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.640
She is believed to be armed
and dangerous.

24:32.039 --> 24:35.920
We're very grateful. We couldn't
have solved this without you.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.720
Not to be a party pooper, but...

24:40.799 --> 24:44.000
This case isn't solved.

24:44.079 --> 24:48.920
We have DNA and a confession.
It doesn't get much clearer than that.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.759
Jeppe and David killed that woman.
There's no doubt about that. But why ?

24:55.440 --> 24:58.240
To make sure
the prostitution ring wasn't exposed.

25:01.039 --> 25:05.200
What about Mariana ? What drove
her to fake her timeigration ?

25:05.279 --> 25:10.480
She was a transtemporal woman
who wanted to fulfil her identity.

25:10.559 --> 25:13.240
- She's a random victim.
- It makes no sense.

25:13.319 --> 25:17.519
You don't buy it either. We've uncovered
some strange phenomena

25:17.599 --> 25:22.960
in the timehole Mariana went to.
I know the murder is connected to that.

25:23.039 --> 25:24.559
What's your theory, Lars ?

25:27.400 --> 25:32.480
I think Jeppe and David
represent powerful interests.

25:32.559 --> 25:36.640
Mariana was a political activist
who worked with Ada to expose them.

25:36.720 --> 25:40.759
Jeppe's statement about the motive
is just a smokescreen.

25:40.839 --> 25:45.240
I still don't understand what you
think is going on in that timehole.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.279
I don't know exactly what is...

25:50.480 --> 25:55.039
A friend of my daughter's
got inexplicable injuries there.

25:55.119 --> 25:58.119
Jeppe and David
have been asking about her.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.160
I don't know who,

26:00.240 --> 26:04.880
but someone in the government
is purposely withholding information.

26:04.960 --> 26:05.960
Please !

26:06.039 --> 26:09.440
You're going down the same road as
when you were forced to step down.

26:09.519 --> 26:11.079
- I'm not high anymore.
- No.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.680
But long- term stress
can create confusion, too.

26:15.759 --> 26:19.839
I have found that Pilates
is great for reducing stress.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.559
Want to tag along some time ?
It could be exactly what you need.

26:34.079 --> 26:36.240
Come, Maria ! Maria !

27:08.240 --> 27:12.519
Will you fire up the Weber, honey ?
They'll be here any minute now.

27:16.440 --> 27:21.400
I can get the grill ready
if you want to lie down for a bit.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.799
No, don't be silly.
The grill is my responsibility.

27:28.240 --> 27:31.960
The police suspect heathen Norse gangs

27:32.039 --> 27:36.839
to be responsible for the vandalism
on St. Olav's Cathedral last night.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.079
They suspect a connection
to the Viking warrior Tore Hund,

27:41.160 --> 27:44.160
who has recently
been discovered in our time.

27:44.240 --> 27:49.160
Our reporter met with
a taciturn Tore Hund earlier today.

27:49.240 --> 27:53.599
- Can we have a comment ?
- Stop waving that thing in my face.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.240
You Christians have no fucking manners.

27:56.319 --> 28:00.640
- This is the third church...
- Ready ?

28:08.279 --> 28:09.960
Nils 34.

28:11.279 --> 28:14.000
Nils 34.

28:19.079 --> 28:20.920
Olga 63.

28:22.039 --> 28:24.079
Olga 63.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.799
Bingo !

28:29.599 --> 28:32.839
You again, Berit ?
Are you able to eat all this fruit ?

28:32.920 --> 28:34.960
What we don't eat,
we put in the freezer.

28:35.039 --> 28:36.359
Lovely !

28:36.960 --> 28:39.680
That's all for today, everyone.

28:39.759 --> 28:43.440
- May I step outside for a bit, mum ?
- Of course, son.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.839
I'll grab one of these. Thanks.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.119
When the Norse culture society
at Grorud offered to throw me

28:52.200 --> 28:55.440
a migration day party,
I didn't know how to answer.

28:56.319 --> 28:59.000
I have never celebrated
this occasion before.

28:59.079 --> 29:03.680
I was more concerned with where
I was going than where I came from.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.000
So why did I end up
accepting the offer ?

29:09.079 --> 29:12.680
The most important reason
is sitting over there.

29:12.759 --> 29:16.519
I don't want Maria to grow up
with a father without a past,

29:17.240 --> 29:21.519
And as memories have started to return,
I have started to feel a bond

29:21.599 --> 29:25.039
between what has been
and what is to come.

29:26.519 --> 29:32.559
Cheers ! For the blowing wind,
for the falling leaves.

29:33.519 --> 29:35.640
And for the growing grass.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.319
- Cheers !
- Cheers !

29:44.559 --> 29:45.960
Alfhildr ?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.960
It means a lot that you
all came today.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.519
Don't mention it.

29:54.799 --> 29:57.960
What is it ?
Something on your mind ?

29:59.920 --> 30:02.920
I had a memory today, about you.

30:05.039 --> 30:08.599
I don't know if this
is the right occasion, but...

30:08.680 --> 30:11.960
- I have to tell you that I...
- Fire away.

30:12.039 --> 30:14.039
We don't see each other that often.

30:16.759 --> 30:20.119
Let's do this later. The band is here.

30:41.319 --> 30:43.279
Don't you want to dance ?

30:43.359 --> 30:47.359
Dancing is for those with coursing
blood. The hospital sucked me dry.

30:51.119 --> 30:56.440
- I've acquired a... Kama Sutra book.
- What the hell is that ?

30:56.759 --> 31:03.119
- An Easterlandish love-making manual.
- Yeah, that'd better be a thick book.

31:04.920 --> 31:09.599
I can tell that you're considering
giving me a second chance.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.599
According to this
come- and- suck- at- it book,

31:14.680 --> 31:18.319
is it okay to prey on sick,
vulnerable women ?

31:18.400 --> 31:22.400
Vulnerable ?
Don't make me laugh.

31:50.839 --> 31:51.799
Tore !

32:05.640 --> 32:09.319
- How's Tore ?
- He's unharmed.

32:09.960 --> 32:13.400
See ? The shield maiden's still got it.

32:15.680 --> 32:20.000
Sure as hell you still got it.
Be strong now.

32:23.759 --> 32:26.839
Don't you understand this
is for the best ?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.920
I can't handle losing you again.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.559
See you in Valhalla.

33:25.359 --> 33:28.000
Many people attended
the memorial service

33:28.079 --> 33:30.880
for the woman killed
at RomsÃ¥s yesterday.

33:30.960 --> 33:36.799
Many had flowers and posters
to show their disgust for hate crime.

34:02.119 --> 34:03.559
Come on.

34:06.039 --> 34:07.759
It's about to start.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.920
I don't feel so good.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
Maybe I'll just stay here.

34:23.480 --> 34:30.400
A coward believes he will ever live,
if he keeps him safe from strife.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.559
But old age leaves him
not long in peace,

34:34.639 --> 34:37.239
though spears may spare his life.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.440
We honour you, Urd Sighvatsdottir.

34:47.719 --> 34:52.840
Child of fire and blood.
Warrior queen and queen of the night.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.440
May your sword glimmer
forever in Valhalla.

34:58.679 --> 35:03.480
Never doubt, always fight !

35:03.559 --> 35:07.800
Never doubt, always fight !

35:07.880 --> 35:11.440
Never doubt, always fight !

35:11.519 --> 35:15.320
Never doubt, always fight !

35:32.960 --> 35:35.760
- You must help me !
- What's the problem ?

35:35.840 --> 35:37.920
I found her on the beach.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.960
- What are you talking about ?
- I think she just migrated.

36:18.480 --> 36:24.039
I'm sorry it had to be this way,
but I can't trust anyone anymore.

36:24.119 --> 36:27.280
You caught the pigs
who killed Mariana, right ?

36:28.840 --> 36:30.119
Me and my partner.

36:32.519 --> 36:34.920
What were you doing
on the fjord that night ?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.440
We got word that the government
was doing illegal testing

36:38.519 --> 36:42.920
on beforeigners arriving
in the timehole at 59.89/10.74.

36:44.039 --> 36:48.239
We faked a migration
to find out what the tests were about.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.119
What went wrong ?

36:50.199 --> 36:54.400
We didn't know the harbour officers
had criminals reporting to them.

36:54.480 --> 36:58.960
Navn tipped off Jeppe and David about
Mariana's arrival in the timehole.

36:59.039 --> 37:01.800
- Who are David and Jeppe working for ?
- I have to go.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.920
So they murdered Navn, and they're
trying to frame you with the drone ?

37:06.000 --> 37:10.760
Yes. Here's all the intel
I've gathered about their activities.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.280
What was that memory
you wanted to share with me ?

38:07.840 --> 38:11.039
I'm not sure about this, Alfhildr.

38:11.119 --> 38:15.400
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not a little girl anymore.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.840
It was about the day we found you.

38:24.519 --> 38:25.679
We were out at sea.

38:31.719 --> 38:33.719
We had been on a raid.

38:39.119 --> 38:43.159
You did well.
It'll get easier with time.

38:48.639 --> 38:50.599
What the hell ?

38:56.480 --> 39:00.519
We see something floating in the ocean.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.760
My father picked it up.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.760
- What kind of a creature is this ?
- It's obviously a human child.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.920
But where did she come from ?

39:25.320 --> 39:27.599
Don't cry.

39:27.679 --> 39:29.360
Don't cry.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.760
- Then he baptises you.
- "Nomansdaughter".

39:34.199 --> 39:37.320
Enginnsdottir (Nomansdaughter) !

40:03.480 --> 40:08.559
You didn't think quitting the drops
would get rid of me, did you ?

40:08.639 --> 40:10.800
When you've opened
that door in your head,

40:10.880 --> 40:12.840
it takes more than
that to close it.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.039
I know you're not real. You're dead.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.559
So dead people aren't real ?

40:30.039 --> 40:32.239
So this is what they're hiding ?

40:35.760 --> 40:40.639
Time is not a one-way street, like
government would like us to believe.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.679
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:13.400 --> 41:18.159
I realize this isn't a good time,
but we have to talk about the case.

41:18.239 --> 41:21.199
- Ada contacted me.
- You're right.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.400
- About what ?
- This isn't a good time.

41:26.519 --> 41:27.800
Okay.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.199
Okay.

41:35.840 --> 41:40.920
- What do you want to do tonight ?
- Tonight, I want to dance and forget.

41:56.679 --> 41:58.360
Do you know how to dance ?

42:00.760 --> 42:01.880
Okay.

42:04.119 --> 42:08.199
- So you're a dancing policeman ?
- I don't know what I am anymore.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.960
You're not the only one.

44:32.039 --> 44:33.559
Is it really you ?

44:35.679 --> 44:37.280
Yes, my dear.

44:42.159 --> 44:44.679
How much do you remember ?

44:44.760 --> 44:48.480
It all came rushing back
when I heard your message.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.559
Your things were still here.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.920
I almost forgot how tall you are.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.079
They don't call me
Olav the Stout for nothing.

45:18.119 --> 45:22.559
Come on. Let's go save
these heathen mongrels.
