My very
first apartment,

02:42.997 --> 02:45.291
we had, like, dinner
you'd eat on our floor.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.839
Oh, my God.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.466
- Welcome home, Mrs. Reece.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.012
- Can you
believe it? Yikes?
- Yikes.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.556
I can believe it.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.974
- This is crazy.
- It is.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.560
I mean, something about
signing a 30-year loan

03:04.643 --> 03:06.437
really kind of
drives it home, huh?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.607
30 years here? Are we crazy?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.358
I don't know.
Do you even have to ask?

03:13.152 --> 03:15.362
It is... it is truly ugly.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.323
We...

03:20.534 --> 03:23.370
- We have to take
this wallpaper down.
- Yeah.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.080
- And the carpet.
- Exactly.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.666
- Have vision.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.918
- For instance...
- Wow.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.753
...gun safe right here.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.714
Work bench, flag from JBAD.
Spruce this place right up.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.675
Oh, no. This whole room's
gonna be my office.

03:36.759 --> 03:37.885
What?

03:37.968 --> 03:41.221
This is my office.
You can have the garage.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.765
No. That's not gonna happen.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.183
- Yeah.
- Nonstarter.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.392
Well,
we'll see about that.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.894
You want to check out
the bedrooms?

03:46.977 --> 03:49.229
Yeah, I do,
but we're here to work,

03:49.313 --> 03:51.231
so don't get any funny ideas.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.734
We'll see about that, too.

Go! Ring it!

04:36.193 --> 04:37.319
I have the weight!

There ain't no quit!

04:55.796 --> 04:58.048
Your JAG is here, sir.
Captain Howard.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.933
Everything in order?

05:08.017 --> 05:10.227
Regarding Odin's Sword,

05:10.310 --> 05:13.147
we should have deniability.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.191
- What's that mean, "should"?
- Tragedies occur.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.485
The op was built
on team intelligence.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.987
We can't be held responsible.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.907
What about the experiment?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.995
It's worth noting that
none of this is tested,

05:28.078 --> 05:30.330
judicially speaking,

05:30.414 --> 05:31.582
but the N.D.A.A. is clear.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.250
In the event this goes before

05:33.333 --> 05:34.626
- the courts...
- Are we covered or not?

05:38.922 --> 05:40.966
Orders are orders,

05:41.050 --> 05:43.135
but I doubt James Reece
sees it that way.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.016
I believe it is time

05:49.099 --> 05:51.935
to seriously consider
contingencies.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.731
What kind of contingencies?

05:55.814 --> 05:57.775
Tactical retrograde.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.819
I've compiled a list
of non-extradition countries.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.988
- Bullshit.
- Everyone is dead.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.948
I have a family to think about.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.284
I'm not moving to Cameroon
'cause of James fucking Reece.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.912
Stop... talking.

06:12.956 --> 06:17.127
We're Naval command,
not some Wall Street jackass.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.798
As long as we have legal cover,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.966
we have a position to defend.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.761
And if disgraced Commander Reece

06:25.844 --> 06:27.846
wants to show up here,

06:27.930 --> 06:31.642
there are 5,000 sailors who'll
have something to say about it.

06:35.813 --> 06:37.815
I see them.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.527
They've been meeting up
daily since you dropped Horn.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.657
Cox and Howard
are living on the economy,

06:46.740 --> 06:48.992
so there's
ample opportunity there.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.329
Pillar, however,
is not leaving base,

06:52.412 --> 06:55.916
and I'm assuming you don't want
to take on the entire N.A.B.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.151
Maybe we take out the first two
and wait on Pillar.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.279
Hit him with a sniper shot.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.197
From the boat?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.285
That's a coin flip
on a good day.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.705
And we can't risk a miss.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.086
You remember Mosul?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.047
Yeah, what about it?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.593
Sayidati al-Jamila?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.097
Howard's got a family.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.894
Bold move.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.181
Anything else, please,
ask the FBI.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.724
Moving.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.688
James Reece
didn't kill Mike Tedesco.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.357
You and your men did.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.651
Well, Talos offers
security. They're not hitmen,

08:45.734 --> 08:48.820
Ms. Buranek. You think
I wasn't aware of you?

08:48.904 --> 08:51.907
I know you tested
RD4895 on Navy SEALs,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.742
and I know those tests
caused tumors,

08:53.825 --> 08:56.578
so you had them murdered.
It's all in my story.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.705
If you try to take me out,
everyone will know the truth.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.458
Your fucking deal's
about to fall apart!

09:07.422 --> 09:09.466
It's easy today
to wake up afraid.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.178
The acts of violence
that we saw on television

09:13.262 --> 09:16.306
this week cannot be ignored.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.725
The administration
has acted quickly

09:18.809 --> 09:22.688
to classify James Sullivan Reece

09:22.771 --> 09:25.107
as a domestic terrorist.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.449
How about we just
open it up to questions,

09:34.533 --> 09:36.493
- as I'm sure there are many.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.620
- Back row, yes.
- Madam Secretary,

09:38.704 --> 09:41.164
you know Commander Reece
personally, is that correct?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.793
We met several times,
that's right.

09:44.876 --> 09:48.088
Did you suspect there was
something wrong with him?

09:50.132 --> 09:53.051
When you join the armed forces,
you swear an oath

09:53.135 --> 09:55.095
to defend the Constitution
against threats,

09:55.178 --> 09:56.513
foreign and domestic.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.932
I suspect
Commander Reece believes

09:59.016 --> 10:00.851
he's still serving that oath.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.228
Against what,
ma'am?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.358
James Reece believes
he's on some kind of mission,

10:08.442 --> 10:10.319
and he won't stop
until it's done.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.195
Our best chance of catching him

10:12.279 --> 10:13.905
is to determine
who's next on his list,

10:13.989 --> 10:15.449
and to get there before he does.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.159
That means, first and foremost,

10:17.242 --> 10:18.702
running down anyone with ties

10:18.785 --> 10:20.787
to Steve Horn and
Capstone Industries.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.831
Our main goal is capture,

10:22.914 --> 10:24.666
but our top priority
is to prevent

10:24.750 --> 10:26.793
the further loss of life.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.796
If those two things
prove to be at odds, well...

10:29.880 --> 10:32.924
then that's where we're at.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.093
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.471
Okay. Let's go find the man.

11:01.912 --> 11:05.165
Do you know where
James Reece is?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.671
All right, here's the thing.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.090
I need information.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.341
Here we go.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.301
I've got 5,000 words
on James Reece,

11:16.385 --> 11:18.637
and I'm this close
to having my story.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.347
You are on thin
fucking ice, lady.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.848
I can't finish
without you.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.518
And you're not gonna
find him without me.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.525
Tell me what you've got.
I'll see what I can do.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.819
That's as good as it gets.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.073
You have access
to Steve Horn's computers.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.325
Run a search for something
called a "Cap Table."

11:40.409 --> 11:41.827
It's everybody who made money

11:41.910 --> 11:43.036
off the Nubellum sale.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.247
Now, most of the accounts
are legit,

11:45.330 --> 11:48.083
but some represent payments
in a conspiracy

11:48.166 --> 11:50.127
to illegally test a drug

11:50.210 --> 11:53.630
called RD4895 on Navy SEALs.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.924
And how much of this
is coming from Reece?

11:56.007 --> 11:58.427
'Cause he spent three days
talking to ghosts in the woods.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.220
Was that before or after

12:00.303 --> 12:01.930
he pulled your friend
out of a mudslide?

12:02.013 --> 12:04.891
He put me in the fucking
mudslide, smartass.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.227
Listen, I'm not here
to defend Reece.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.105
I know he needs to be stopped,

12:10.188 --> 12:12.983
but he's not the only one who
needs to be held accountable.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.208
Dep, have CART run a deep dive
on Horn's computer.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.627
Are you serious?

12:32.711 --> 12:34.212
Yes, sir.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.968
All right, well, there's
a library down the street.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.928
- I'll be there
working on my story...
- The last time

12:42.012 --> 12:45.056
I let you walk,
you fled to San Francisco.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.602
Junior, she does not
leave this room.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.902
Sorry, sir. I asked her to wait.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.745
At ease, Gerald.
It's your office.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.581
Ma'am. I saw you were in town.

13:09.664 --> 13:12.167
I wasn't expecting you
to stop by.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.544
This is an impromptu visit.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.046
Hmm.

13:18.215 --> 13:22.052
- And who's this?
- DCIS Agent Azad.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.347
I wanted to make sure
everything was to protocol

13:25.430 --> 13:26.848
for this conversation.

13:31.228 --> 13:35.315
I pulled the TIP
from Operation Odin's Sword.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.859
I was curious
what kind of intelligence

13:37.943 --> 13:40.529
got a whole platoon killed.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.490
I'm familiar
with the intel package.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.076
Well, then you would agree

13:46.159 --> 13:47.536
it's pretty weak.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.330
A major operation
based on a walk-in

13:50.413 --> 13:52.624
from an arms dealer?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.417
Nothing more?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.419
Anyone even vet this?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.297
I had a standing order

13:59.381 --> 14:01.925
from the Pentagon

14:02.008 --> 14:03.760
to move on Kahani

14:03.843 --> 14:06.596
if any actionable intel came in.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.307
The officer
who elevated the report,

14:09.391 --> 14:12.018
who was it?

14:14.229 --> 14:16.314
That's more of
a Langley question.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.653
Thank you, Gerald.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.281
That's it?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.491
For now.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.372
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Admiral.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.707
I'll be in touch.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.632
Get me Captain Howard, now.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.742
Mom, Coach Hansen said
that if we win next week,

15:08.825 --> 15:11.244
we go to states and we
have to pay our own way.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.163
Like, everyone. I don't
understand how that's fair.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.582
Shouldn't the school
get us a bus or something?

15:15.665 --> 15:17.917
- What's up, Dad?
- You're home early.

15:18.001 --> 15:18.960
Hey.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.837
I, um...

15:22.672 --> 15:25.967
So, listen, guys, we, um...

15:26.051 --> 15:27.886
We're going to the Keys.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.846
- What?
- Yeah. Tonight.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.015
- What are you talking about?
- I got tickets.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.559
Just need to pack our bags.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.853
Wha... No, Dad, I-I can't.
I have soccer tonight.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.063
Well, there's no soccer tonight.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.564
Come on, let's get your things.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.066
Is something wrong?

15:41.149 --> 15:44.194
No. No.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.196
Just think of it
as a, uh, vacation

15:46.279 --> 15:47.405
till things settle down.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.200
- Until what settles down?
- Listen.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.077
This is gonna be fun, okay?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.412
- Whatever this is,
it isn't fun.

Come on, let's go.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.756

- Tonight.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.163
Run, rabbit, run.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.749
We'll be ready.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.377
Yeah.

16:52.762 --> 16:57.225
Listen, brother, I've been
doing some thinking, and, uh...

16:57.308 --> 16:59.728
however this goes,

16:59.811 --> 17:03.773
the Feds are gonna
keep digging and digging.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.237
And even with your Agency cover,
they'll find something on you.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.614
You got a plan?

17:11.698 --> 17:12.907
Yeah.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.998
You ever hear of Máncora?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.668
Little surf town
on the coast of Peru.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.714
Pulls in a fucking
monster swell.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.216
Got hot springs, mud baths,

17:30.300 --> 17:32.385
ayahuasca, maybe some
Aussie girls.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.347
Not a bad place to retire.

Not you. Remember that.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.653
Are you sure
you want to do this?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.305
- Agent Layun.
- Stay put.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.644
We searched Horn's computers.
We found several correspondences

19:04.727 --> 19:08.064
with Admiral Pillar
mentioning the drug RD4895,

19:08.147 --> 19:10.900
including medicals
on Reece's troop.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.444
Pillar knew the men
were developing brain tumors.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.906
He got paid for his part
in the experiment.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.700

that's Gerald Pillar.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.789

that's Leonard Howard.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.833

through our on-base liaison.

James Reece is here.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.612
He's in Coronado right now,
and we have his list.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.077
Is that a "yes"?

20:03.161 --> 20:05.371
Dep, you're at the Reece house.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.248
- Anything off, you flag me.

Mac, you've got Cox.
Coordinate with PD.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.798
- Agent, I gave you that tip.
- Sit down!

20:15.882 --> 20:17.634
If you're lucky, you find out
how your story ends.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.183
You gonna at least
tell me what you did?

20:25.266 --> 20:27.018
I didn't do anything, per se.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.978
Then why are you running away?

20:29.062 --> 20:31.606
The admiral got involved
in something.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.608
Something...

20:33.691 --> 20:37.654
something bad, and he asked me
to cover for him, and I...

20:39.280 --> 20:41.324
Look, I felt bad
at the time. I just...

20:41.407 --> 20:43.493
Gerald has been good
to me, to us.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.163
He supported us. He put me up
for promotions. He...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.539
How exposed are you?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.166
- It's not about that, Anne.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.044
And it's gonna pay off,
just-just not here.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.004
- In the Keys?
- Dad!

20:55.088 --> 20:57.006
Just tell the driver
I'll be right there.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.718
Just... please, Anne, please.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.055
Dad, it-it's not the taxi.
It's the FBI.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.812

I'll handle it.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.453

21:45.304 --> 21:46.848
All due respect, sir,

21:46.931 --> 21:49.559
as soon as you crossed
onto base, you left Coronado.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.539
Hell of a day we got.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.416
There's a deranged SEAL
on the loose,

22:13.499 --> 22:15.752
and the FBI wants to knock
on the one door

22:15.835 --> 22:17.378
we know he's not behind.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.964
Sir, we're federal agents
with a search warrant.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.884
Get that out of my face.
You think I give a live shit

- You're getting put on ice.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.450
Excuse me?

34:36.533 --> 34:39.161
Your team will be assigned back
to their respective departments.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.371
The FBI investigates malfeasance

34:41.455 --> 34:43.332
at the Pentagon,
not the other way around.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.417
That's correct.
And frankly, Agent Layun,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.753
I have no personal interest
pulling you off this case.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.464
From what I hear,
you run a good shop.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.466
- You overstepped.
- Overstepped?

34:52.549 --> 34:55.427
This admiral ran illegal
experiments on his own men.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.554
It wasn't illegal,
not technically.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.015
You're talking about this?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.100
Pillar had an Emergency Use
Authorization

35:02.184 --> 35:03.602
approving the experiment.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.650
The experiment wasn't a crime,

35:09.733 --> 35:12.152
but we believe
there was a cover-up.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.155
I'll give you two the office.

35:22.663 --> 35:25.290
You turn over
everything you have on Pillar

35:25.374 --> 35:27.543
and his officers to DCIS.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.797
Then you're going on leave.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.300
Reece is still out there.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.553
A short leave.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.472
No one's looking to
break your back on this.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.599
Washington called L.A.

35:42.683 --> 35:45.435
They're sending their FTF down
to officially take over.

35:47.855 --> 35:50.983
Case should've been theirs
from the get-go.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.374
Why do you
want this so bad?

36:07.457 --> 36:09.209
- What?
- This story.

36:09.293 --> 36:10.919
You trying to make a name
for yourself,

36:11.003 --> 36:12.880
or you think it'll actually
make a difference?

36:12.963 --> 36:16.675
I can't have ambition
and believe in what I do?

36:16.758 --> 36:18.135
If you had to choose.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.730
When I was four,

36:29.813 --> 36:33.442
my dad decided he was gonna
break from the CCP,

36:33.525 --> 36:36.111
go against the Xiaoping regime.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.698
So, he sent me, my mom,
and my brother to the States.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.285
I never saw him again.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.166
By the time I was six,
I had lost my home,

36:49.249 --> 36:52.002
my language, even my name,

36:52.085 --> 36:54.922
all because my dad
believed in taking a stand.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.634
So, yeah,

36:58.717 --> 37:00.719
I'd like to believe
the truth matters.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.307
Especially when it's
David versus Goliath.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.143
And which one is Reece?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.062
David or Goliath?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.653
I'm still working that out.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.838
A funny thing happened today.

37:39.216 --> 37:41.009
We found out the Pentagon

37:41.093 --> 37:43.595
authorized RD4895.

37:44.805 --> 37:46.765
Even stranger,
there's one stakeholder

37:46.848 --> 37:48.892
that FinCEN can't unmask.

37:48.976 --> 37:50.936
One more person
working with Horn.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.438
The Pentagon.

37:57.109 --> 37:58.485
That's your Goliath.

38:02.364 --> 38:05.033
Got to go. My team's been
pulled off the case.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.369
What about me?

38:10.163 --> 38:12.708
Finish your story,
Ms. Buranek.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.460
Get it out as soon as possible.

38:35.856 --> 38:39.067
Go home. I'll watch the house
until L.A. shows up.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.151
- Hello?
- Hey, Jord, it's me.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.904
I have the Reece story.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.074
Yeah, I heard.
The Atlantic, huh?

39:27.157 --> 39:28.867
So, you're calling
to rub it in or what?

39:28.950 --> 39:31.161
No. It's big, Jordan.
I have an E.U.A.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.915
signed by Secretary of Defense
Lorraine Hartley. She ordered

39:34.998 --> 39:38.502
a covert experiment that gave
Reece and his men tumors.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.045
Jesus.

39:40.128 --> 39:42.297
Yeah. What's more,
I can prove that the cover-up

39:42.380 --> 39:44.466
was bought and paid for
by Steve Horn

39:44.549 --> 39:45.759
to protect his investment.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.928
W-Wait, the SecDef took a cut?

39:48.011 --> 39:50.263
Well, there's one shareholder
the FBI couldn't unmask,

39:50.347 --> 39:51.765
and given Hartley's involvement,

39:51.848 --> 39:54.142
I think readers will come
to the same conclusion I did,

39:54.226 --> 39:55.852
or at least

39:55.936 --> 39:58.939
force her to answer
for what she's done.

39:59.022 --> 40:02.609

biggest advantage is immediacy.

How soon can you publish?

40:04.236 --> 40:05.612
Send it to me.

40:05.695 --> 40:08.198
If it's all there,
I can get it up within the hour.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.492
Deal.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.702
I know it's your
favorite, but I think I found

40:53.785 --> 40:55.537

40:55.620 --> 40:57.998
What do you think?

40:58.081 --> 41:01.835
I think I made at least one
very good decision in my life.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.631
Are you sure?

41:06.715 --> 41:09.176
- Like, 75%.
- Don't be a dick.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.477

I can't let you keep doing this.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.214
I'm not gonna tell you again.

53:39.467 --> 53:40.968
Stay off my list.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.043
- Yeah?
- Jordan,
what's going on?

54:14.126 --> 54:15.252
It's been an hour.

54:15.336 --> 54:17.213
Well, you tell me.
I've been waiting.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.173
What do you mean "waiting"?

54:19.256 --> 54:20.841
Okay, here's how
the Internet works, all right?

54:20.925 --> 54:22.134
You actually have to
send me something

54:22.218 --> 54:24.053
for me to publish it, okay?

54:25.096 --> 54:27.056
I did send it.

54:27.139 --> 54:30.393
Um...

54:30.476 --> 54:32.728
No, you didn't.

54:35.982 --> 54:37.400
Jordan, I got to go.

54:37.483 --> 54:38.985
No, Katie. Don't do this
to me again for...

54:39.068 --> 54:42.279

I read your story, Ms. Buranek.
It's a hell of a piece.

Unfortunately, it's wrong.

55:23.404 --> 55:25.906
Oh, if you want to leave
and walk away,

55:25.990 --> 55:28.159
we won't follow,

a journalist
