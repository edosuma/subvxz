WEBVTT

00:05.230 --> 00:09.070
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union...

00:09.089 --> 00:12.019
of María and Enrique.

00:12.189 --> 00:14.009
María...

00:14.029 --> 00:16.199
Do you promise
to love and cherish Enrique...

00:17.140 --> 00:19.230
in sorry and joy,

00:20.070 --> 00:22.030
until death us to part?

00:26.149 --> 00:27.160
Gustavo?

00:29.050 --> 00:32.070
María, I just wanted to tell you
that...

00:56.009 --> 00:57.189
FIFTH MONTH

02:09.199 --> 02:11.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:11.199 --> 02:14.180
This is Rocío.
Rocío, María.

02:14.199 --> 02:16.129
-Hi, Rocío.
-Hi.

02:18.129 --> 02:21.020
She's a fantastic person.
She's gonna amaze you.

02:21.039 --> 02:24.069
-We'll all have breakfast
tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.099
-Good night.
-Some bagels.

02:35.159 --> 02:37.050
You're so hot!

02:39.180 --> 02:42.120
PERFECT LIFE

02:42.139 --> 02:46.039
WHEN NOTHING IS THE WAY IT
SEEMS.

02:50.060 --> 02:52.189
She studies industrial
engineering.

02:53.009 --> 02:55.050
Doesn't a 20-year-old bore you?

02:55.069 --> 02:58.069
Why would she bore me?
I haven't slept, Sebas!

02:58.090 --> 02:59.120
Wow, man.

02:59.139 --> 03:03.120
We were at a trap festival,
it's so complicated to dance to.

03:03.139 --> 03:07.069
It's sort of like... you know?
Like...

03:07.090 --> 03:08.180
Then she spent the whole night

03:08.199 --> 03:13.150
eating me out with a really
strong
after-dinner mint in her mouth!

03:13.169 --> 03:15.169
You're crazy, dude!

03:16.219 --> 03:18.009
Hello?

03:19.009 --> 03:20.079
Yes, speaking.

03:22.180 --> 03:25.039
Yes, of course I know you guys.

03:27.009 --> 03:29.120
And what would the show be?

03:31.219 --> 03:33.210
Right, right...

03:37.030 --> 03:40.069
Thing is,
I'm working on a new series
right now

03:40.090 --> 03:43.229
and I don't have enough
paintings
to fill a stand.

03:44.009 --> 03:47.020
But thanks so much for thinking
of me.

03:47.039 --> 03:49.039
All right, bye. Ciao.

03:50.170 --> 03:52.219
-Who was it?
-Christ, man.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.020
Barcelona modern art market!

03:55.039 --> 03:57.159
They're offering me a place
to sell my stuff,

03:57.180 --> 04:00.009
but I'm doing research right
now.

04:00.030 --> 04:02.150
-I can't go with the stuff I
have.
-You're mad!

04:02.169 --> 04:04.099
Call right now or you're
history!

04:04.120 --> 04:05.219
No, I don't have anything.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
You've got plenty of paintings.
Bloody hell, Esther!

04:09.020 --> 04:12.039
Here we go again: doubts,
doubts...
Go on, call them!

04:14.159 --> 04:16.069
Go ahead laugh,

04:16.089 --> 04:18.100
but if my jeans rub against me
I get turned on.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.139
That's your pregnancy hormones.
Of course.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.000
-And when does that stop?
-After you give birth.

04:23.019 --> 04:24.220
What? Four months like that?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.069
-I can't.
-No, you need to get laid.

04:27.089 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, yeah. Who with?

04:29.110 --> 04:32.159
-Get on one of those dating
apps.
-What?

04:32.180 --> 04:34.029
All right, okay, no.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.029
Got it!

04:36.180 --> 04:38.019
My friend Alberto.

04:38.159 --> 04:41.060
-Yes!
-No.

04:41.079 --> 04:44.060
You meet. See each other,
get to know each other.

04:44.079 --> 04:47.000
And if you fancy him,
you go back to his place and
screw.

04:49.009 --> 04:50.209
-Is he good looking?
-Yes.

04:51.149 --> 04:52.230
He's sexy.

04:55.199 --> 04:57.100
Not a bad idea.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.230
But how will I know
if there's chemistry?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.149
-If there's... you know.
-Jesus, it's just sex.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.220
You don't need to fall in love
with him.

05:06.019 --> 05:08.089
Just a second.
It's Pablo calling from Paris.

05:08.110 --> 05:10.100
Chuchuwa, chuchuwa!

05:10.120 --> 05:12.040
Chuchuwa!

05:12.060 --> 05:16.040
-Mum, shall we sing Chuchuwa?
-All right, show María.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.110
-Chuchuwa.
-Me?

05:17.129 --> 05:20.000
How does it go?
That way I practice.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.129
Chuchuwa, chuchuwa.

05:22.149 --> 05:24.029
-Do I do this?
-Yeah.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.199
KITTYONHEAT84:
Sorry, was in shower.
-Do what I say.
-Okay.

05:26.220 --> 05:30.120
About to put on lingerie.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.209
CARPEDIEM741:
Would love to see that.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.019
Bet they're see through
knickers.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.129
KITTYONHEAT84:
Show them to you when you want.

05:39.149 --> 05:42.100
The knickers and all the rest.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.029
Are you not singing?

05:44.050 --> 05:48.120
CARPEDIEM741:
Are we finally going to meet
then?
Can't wait...

05:48.139 --> 05:50.189
-You're not doing it right!
-Me?

05:50.209 --> 05:52.060
What are you on about?

05:52.079 --> 05:55.079
I'm doing Chuchuwa!
KITTYONHEAT84:
Know a discreet hotel?

05:55.100 --> 05:57.209
Need to screw you. Now. Right
now.

06:01.019 --> 06:02.050
Right.

06:03.209 --> 06:05.000
Huh?

06:05.019 --> 06:06.160
No, here's the thing.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.230
Pablo is in Paris and I feel bad
about leaving the kids with my
mum.

06:10.009 --> 06:11.230
I don't want to take advantage.

06:12.149 --> 06:15.079
Would you mind sitting in for me
at the meeting?

06:15.189 --> 06:16.209
Huh?

06:17.050 --> 06:18.110
Yes. Sorry.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.069
I was taking her temperature.
She has such a high fever.

06:21.129 --> 06:22.160
Terrible.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.160
Aha.

06:23.180 --> 06:27.199
I'm so grateful to you.
I mean it, thank you so much.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.199
Okay, okay.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.019
Thanks, bye. Ciao.

06:35.079 --> 06:38.000
CARPEDIEM741:
On my way. Dying to go down on
you.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.230
KITTYONHEAT84:
Me too. Wait for you in the
room.

06:42.009 --> 06:43.090
Want to see you now.

06:43.110 --> 06:46.120
CARPEDIEM741:
You'll drain me.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.009
KITTYONHEAT84:
Want you to nail me from behind.

06:49.029 --> 06:51.050
Are those chocolates?

06:52.199 --> 06:54.189
Yes, sweetie, but for grown-ups.

06:54.209 --> 06:57.029
Know who's going to bring some
for kids? Granny.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.220
Yay! Chocolates, chocolates!

07:00.000 --> 07:02.029
Chocolates!

07:26.089 --> 07:28.139
-That one amazes me.
-This one? Are you mad?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.120
I look scared and sad.

07:30.139 --> 07:33.009
And I'm frowning.
It's hideous, I hate it.

07:33.090 --> 07:35.129
What's your sale price?

07:35.149 --> 07:40.050
I was thinking 185 for the small
ones
and 300 for the big ones, tops.

07:40.069 --> 07:42.180
That's shit.
Sell them for a higher price.

07:42.199 --> 07:44.110
You don't know about prices.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.230
Maybe, but you have to value
your art.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.009
They're really ugly, I hate them
all.

07:49.029 --> 07:52.000
Why the hell did I say yes?
I should have said no.

07:52.019 --> 07:53.220
Hey, they're all amazing.

07:56.029 --> 07:57.069
You're a genius.

07:57.090 --> 07:59.189
You say that because I'm a good
lay.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.160
No, I mean it.

08:02.029 --> 08:04.089
You just need someone to
discover you.

08:07.100 --> 08:11.009
I think you'll end up exhibiting
at the New York Museum of Modern
Art.

08:11.029 --> 08:12.209
-Come off it!
-Seriously.

08:12.230 --> 08:16.029
-I bet the MoMA will call me
tomorrow.
-The MoMA.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.120
And the Reina Sofía Museum.

08:19.139 --> 08:23.019
You're such a jerk.
You're daft as a brush.

08:24.139 --> 08:25.199
And the Pompidou Centre.

08:27.129 --> 08:29.120
The Tate Gallery!

08:30.069 --> 08:32.039
No tickling!

08:32.059 --> 08:33.200
Stop or I'll pee myself!

09:53.019 --> 09:54.049
Hi.

09:54.149 --> 09:55.230
Hi.

10:29.110 --> 10:31.200
God, I was dying to do this!

10:57.039 --> 10:58.059
Sorry.

11:00.029 --> 11:02.169
It's a stupid ringtone I added
the other day.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.129
Yes.

11:06.070 --> 11:08.139
Third song on Sing & Play.

11:10.129 --> 11:11.139
Yes.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.139
Right...

11:14.080 --> 11:16.019
My little girl loves it.

11:20.009 --> 11:21.220
I lied on my profile. I have...

11:23.070 --> 11:24.230
I have two little girls.

11:27.149 --> 11:29.049
I lied, too.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.049
I have a little girl.

11:32.009 --> 11:33.100
Right.

11:35.230 --> 11:37.169
How old is she?

11:38.090 --> 11:39.120
Four.

11:40.179 --> 11:42.029
What about yours?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.149
Six and 14 months.

12:19.110 --> 12:22.029
Answer it if you want. Answer
it.

12:26.090 --> 12:29.149
Darling, I'm just about to go
in.
Is everything all right?

12:30.049 --> 12:33.090
Okay, put her on,
but I can't talk for long.

12:34.009 --> 12:36.159
Hi, sweetheart. Hi.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.220
What are you doing?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.110
What? I can't...

12:40.129 --> 12:43.009
"Cachupimba," what's that?

12:45.080 --> 12:47.090
Are you playing with mum?

12:48.139 --> 12:51.100
Count to ten, close your eyes.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.139
Before you know it, I'll be
home.

12:53.210 --> 12:56.000
-No.
-And is there no insurance?

12:56.019 --> 12:57.070
No.

12:58.129 --> 13:01.049
What I don't get
is why you have to pay to sell
there.

13:01.070 --> 13:03.090
I guess because the venue
has expenses.

13:03.110 --> 13:06.100
Electricity, water, everything.
You pay for the name.

13:07.009 --> 13:10.039
-What if you don't sell
anything?
-Everybody does.

13:10.059 --> 13:13.110
-There must be someone who
doesn't.
-You're such a stickler.

13:13.129 --> 13:16.100
Thanks for thinking
that that someone will be me.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.029
I didn't say that,
you need to weigh up all the
options.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.149
They might con you.

13:21.029 --> 13:24.159
I love what you do.
I have complete faith in you.

13:25.159 --> 13:27.139
But they shouldn't charge you.

13:28.049 --> 13:30.090
Want to learn to play chess...

13:30.110 --> 13:33.049
All right, guys. Guys.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.080
All right. I'll introduce you,
okay?

13:37.100 --> 13:40.179
This is María, and this is
Esther.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.220
-Hi.
-Hi, María.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.179
-My mates.
-Pleased to meet you.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.169
This is Xosé, who has...

13:46.190 --> 13:51.000
-The famous Xosé?
-Who has 54% disability.

13:53.059 --> 13:54.179
Oh dear!

13:55.009 --> 13:57.110
-You're the famous María.
-Yes.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.230
-Richi.
-Okay.

13:59.009 --> 14:04.009
Sorry, Richi and Nata,
my former flatmates.

14:04.029 --> 14:05.200
-Oh, the three of you live here.
-Yes.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.000
-Can I touch your belly?
-Yes.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.039
He kicks already, you'll see.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.120
I could feel it!

14:21.090 --> 14:23.070
-Did you feel it?
-Yes.

14:23.090 --> 14:25.080
-And do you feel all right?
-Yes.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.000
-How far along are you?
-Five months.

14:27.019 --> 14:29.019
Good for you!

14:29.039 --> 14:31.039
Is this flat yours, Gari?

14:31.230 --> 14:34.210
Yes, I inherited it from my mum.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.220
Wow, man, that's lucky.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.049
Hey, everyone!

14:39.159 --> 14:41.149
Surprise!

14:42.090 --> 14:44.210
It's from everyone.

14:47.029 --> 14:49.139
Come on, let's give it up for
Gari.

14:49.159 --> 14:51.110
Now he's independent!

14:53.059 --> 14:56.230
Thank you very much, really.

14:57.009 --> 14:59.159
You guys are the best...

14:59.179 --> 15:01.120
And...

15:01.190 --> 15:03.230
And you've helped me a lot.

15:04.009 --> 15:07.000
I'm really glad
that you're all part of my life.

15:07.019 --> 15:08.210
Be happy, dude!

15:11.129 --> 15:13.230
Will the baby live here?

15:14.159 --> 15:17.169
Yes. Well, at weekends.

15:17.190 --> 15:19.149
Every weekend.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.139
-That's cool.
-Sure.

15:21.159 --> 15:23.090
Of course it is.

15:23.110 --> 15:26.059
Anybody want any more beer or
anything?

15:26.080 --> 15:27.049
No, thanks.

15:27.070 --> 15:28.080
A beer?

15:28.100 --> 15:31.029
-Water.
-You want cheese.

15:31.049 --> 15:32.169
You too, okay.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.129
You want water...

15:38.029 --> 15:40.039
I'm going to pop outside a
minute.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.059
I'm going outside.

16:03.169 --> 16:07.230
MARÍA: Cris, I'm watching a
couple
screwing in the building over
the road.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.210
Everyone is screwing except me.

16:10.230 --> 16:14.090
DAD: I think you got
the wrong chat, love.

16:14.110 --> 16:15.190
No, no...

16:18.070 --> 16:20.159
MARÍA:
It's a joke me and Cris have.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.120
DAD: Ok.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.080
Hi.

16:31.019 --> 16:32.039
Hey.

16:37.149 --> 16:38.230
Need anything?

16:40.159 --> 16:41.220
To get laid.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.159
Sorry.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.059
Sorry about that.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.039
I didn't mean with you.
Didn't mean to embarrass you.

16:49.059 --> 16:51.220
The pregnancy hormones
make me feel a bit...

16:53.039 --> 16:54.100
I'm losing it.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.220
Actually, I meant if you need
to know anything

17:02.000 --> 17:05.089
about disabled people with
kids...

17:05.109 --> 17:06.190
just ask me.

17:07.039 --> 17:08.230
I could do with some info.

17:10.190 --> 17:13.039
-Can I write down your number?
-Sure, go ahead.

17:13.150 --> 17:15.150
Is your name with an X?

17:15.220 --> 17:18.089
Xosé, with an X and an S.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.099
-Is it a Galician name?
-Yes.

17:23.230 --> 17:25.220
Okay, "add".

17:27.170 --> 17:28.170
Six what?

17:28.190 --> 17:30.150
Are they screwing?

17:31.069 --> 17:33.019
Oh, yes.

18:57.019 --> 18:58.119
Listen, Cris.

18:58.140 --> 19:02.220
I've decided that I do want that
date
with your friend, okay?

19:03.079 --> 19:04.119
Set it up.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.039
Love you.

19:10.079 --> 19:13.069
Imagine we're going to plant
eggplants
in a field.

19:13.089 --> 19:14.220
You're that field.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.119
First, the soil needs
fertilizing
with ovarian stimulation,

19:17.140 --> 19:20.160
injections you give yourself
over a nine-day period.

19:20.180 --> 19:25.180
And finally, we bring the
ovarian follicle
to maturity with HCG.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.039
Sorry, what is that?

19:27.059 --> 19:29.029
It's a hormone injection.

19:29.049 --> 19:32.029
Then we use a local anesthetic
to retrieve the eggs,

19:32.049 --> 19:36.019
and send Pablo's farmers
to add the eggplant seed.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.160
Great metaphor, isn't it, love?
The eggplant.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.079
-Do you smoke?
-No.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.170
That's better, it's bad for
fertility.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.180
I just need to pop to the
toilet, okay?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.119
I'll be right back.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.200
This is a before and an after
for us.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.140
Okay.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.200
-Are you sure?
-I'm on board.

20:17.119 --> 20:19.119
You need to get lower right 45
fixed.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.210
Thanks for the check-up, doctor.
What do I owe you?

20:22.230 --> 20:25.119
If you shout me this drink,
nothing.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.029
And if I invite you to my place
for a drink?

20:29.210 --> 20:32.000
Well, it would have to be
alcohol-free.

20:32.019 --> 20:34.140
-I can only have one glass a
day.
-Fair enough.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.170
May I ask you something?

20:37.059 --> 20:38.079
Yes.

20:38.230 --> 20:40.069
Can I kiss you?

20:44.059 --> 20:45.089
You're very polite.

20:45.109 --> 20:47.039
Well, I'm an ally.

20:47.059 --> 20:48.079
An ally?

20:48.099 --> 20:50.089
-A feminist.
-Oh.

20:51.140 --> 20:53.119
A feminist ally.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.000
And guys like you ask.

20:55.099 --> 20:57.160
Well, out of respect.

20:57.180 --> 20:59.170
Yes, I think that's great.

21:00.039 --> 21:01.230
I'm a big believer in it.

21:02.009 --> 21:03.230
-Thanks.
-Ally.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.099
-So...
-Go ahead.

21:12.019 --> 21:14.230
I don't usually sleep with
someone
on the first date.

21:15.009 --> 21:16.039
Okay.

21:16.059 --> 21:17.190
-Okay.
-Perfect.

21:21.099 --> 21:24.039
But Cris told me
that you can be trusted.

21:24.109 --> 21:26.099
I think you're...

21:27.039 --> 21:29.079
-I think you're very nice.
-Cool.

21:29.099 --> 21:31.099
-And I find you sexually
attractive.
-Perfect.

21:31.119 --> 21:35.150
-So I wouldn't mind going all
the way.
-Whatever you want.

21:38.170 --> 21:40.230
By that, I mean screwing.

21:41.049 --> 21:44.009
-Today, right now.
-Yes, got it.

21:44.029 --> 21:46.150
It has to be at your place
because I live at my sister's.

21:46.170 --> 21:48.089
-Okay, perfect.
-Okay.

21:53.099 --> 21:56.180
I really turns me on
that you're pregnant.

21:57.190 --> 22:00.109
-What?
-I find it super sexy.

22:01.109 --> 22:02.029
Why?

22:02.049 --> 22:06.009
Maybe it's the hormones,
your breasts full of milk...

22:06.109 --> 22:09.170
-Not yet. The milk comes later.
-All right...

22:09.190 --> 22:12.099
I don't mean it turns me on
that they're full of milk...

22:12.180 --> 22:16.160
I mean, the beauty of new life,
right?

22:19.039 --> 22:21.200
Listen. I think...

22:23.009 --> 22:25.000
we don't have as much chemistry
as I thought.

22:25.019 --> 22:27.160
-I didn't mean to upset you.
-It isn't that, but...

22:27.180 --> 22:30.039
-Don't you have fantasies?
-Yes, of course.

22:30.119 --> 22:33.180
I have fantasies.
Doing it in a car or in a lift.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.130
Where I live has a lift.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.160
What are you looking at?

23:04.019 --> 23:05.069
At you.

23:06.099 --> 23:07.160
And the girls?

23:08.049 --> 23:11.079
Paula is having breakfast by
herself,
Martina is in her cot.

23:13.049 --> 23:14.089
Honey...

23:15.049 --> 23:18.099
What if we wait a while
before trying in vitro?

23:18.190 --> 23:20.009
How so?

23:21.039 --> 23:24.089
I don't know.
Injections and hormones freak me
out.

23:24.109 --> 23:28.109
But darling, the doctor said
there was no risk.

23:29.039 --> 23:30.069
Right...

23:35.069 --> 23:38.069
What if we carry on doing it
naturally
for a few months?

23:38.220 --> 23:40.069
Honey...

23:40.089 --> 23:44.119
To be honest, doing it that way
is making me frustrated.

23:44.140 --> 23:46.220
-It's frustrating having sex
with me?
-No.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.200
It's frustrating doing it
with an objective...

23:49.220 --> 23:52.039
and never achieving that
objective.

23:52.170 --> 23:55.089
Stop, you're covered in foam.
Finish shaving.

23:55.109 --> 23:56.190
Cris...

23:58.039 --> 24:00.019
I'm your friend!

24:00.190 --> 24:03.220
Do you accept the request
to chat to SEXYDARKGUY?

24:04.230 --> 24:05.180
Mummy.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.170
What?

24:06.190 --> 24:09.019
SEXYDARKGUY: Hi, Kitty,
I'm bored at work, what are you
up to?

24:09.039 --> 24:11.099
-How do I know I'm not an alied
see what he says.

24:11.119 --> 24:15.049
I'm off, I'm running late.
Love you, Paula.

24:17.049 --> 24:20.039
Mummy, go on, tell me!

24:20.230 --> 24:22.170
KITTYONHEAT84:
Bored too. Suggestions?

24:22.190 --> 24:24.000
-Mummy...
-What?

24:24.019 --> 24:25.160
-Please tell me...
-Eat up.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.089
-Oh...
-Huh?

24:28.109 --> 24:29.130
Come on.

24:55.150 --> 24:57.059
There she is!

24:57.079 --> 24:59.220
What's up? Hiya, gorgeous!

25:02.019 --> 25:04.180
-Check out the cute T-shirt I
bought.
-Looks great.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.029
What does it say?
"No sucksism or fiminism!"

25:09.009 --> 25:12.049
-Hi, I'm Lucas.
-Pleased to meet you.

25:12.069 --> 25:15.220
-Did you sell anything?
-Not yet, but it's early yet.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.039
Okay. When you sell one,
you'll sell them all.

25:19.190 --> 25:23.009
Listen, I'll take a photo
and that way more people will
come.

25:23.029 --> 25:24.190
-All right.
-Yes.

25:24.210 --> 25:27.009
-Do a Boomerang.
-A Boomerang?

25:27.029 --> 25:29.039
Let's see...

25:29.059 --> 25:30.099
No, but...

25:31.210 --> 25:34.059
Esther, sweetie. It's a dance
move.

25:34.079 --> 25:35.180
Awesome.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.119
Hey, fancy coming to a friend's
birthday party later?

25:41.019 --> 25:43.029
-No.
-Be cool, don't be a bore.

25:43.049 --> 25:44.210
I'm gonna be responsible for
once.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.089
-Sure?
-Sure.

25:46.109 --> 25:49.029
-You'll be along later?
-Sure, gorgeous.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.220
You'll come.

25:51.230 --> 25:53.130
Good luck.

25:55.230 --> 26:00.140
And right now, Cactus Girl
is signing autographs at stand
7.

26:11.150 --> 26:13.069
This is my good side.

26:13.089 --> 26:15.029
Well, it's better from here.

26:17.069 --> 26:18.190
-Thanks
-Thank you.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.160
Really? Oh, thank you!

26:22.220 --> 26:24.200
-Hi. How are you?
-All right.

26:30.119 --> 26:32.170
Thanks a lot, really.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.059
And then suddenly he admitted

26:46.079 --> 26:49.140
it turned him on to think milk
was going to come out of my
boobs.

26:49.230 --> 26:52.210
I don't think it's that
outrageous,
it's a fantasy.

26:52.230 --> 26:55.210
-It freaked me out.
-You're pregnant and you're up
for it.

26:55.230 --> 26:58.190
And he wants to be with a
pregnant woman.
It's perfect.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.079
SEXYDARKGUY: How do we hook up?

27:00.099 --> 27:02.059
No, I'd rather sleep with
someone

27:02.079 --> 27:05.009
who isn't turned on
by another human being inside
me.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.220
-Where's the entrance?
-Over here.

27:07.009 --> 27:09.230
KITTENONHEAT84:
Room 306 at 8 pm
I'll have to go soon.
I have to pick up Paula.

27:10.009 --> 27:11.000
Okay.

27:16.150 --> 27:17.190
Hey.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.089
Who's that guy?

27:20.109 --> 27:22.019
Just a guy, Xosé.

27:22.039 --> 27:24.049
I met him at Gari's party
and invited him.

27:24.069 --> 27:25.210
-You invited him to come!
-Yes.

27:25.230 --> 27:28.019
-Single?
-Divorced, but don't go there.

27:28.039 --> 27:29.029
Why not?

27:29.049 --> 27:31.000
Because he's Gari's
psychologist...

27:31.019 --> 27:33.019
-You'll never get laid like
that...
-This is Cris.

27:33.039 --> 27:34.190
-Hi.
-Pleased to meet you.

27:34.210 --> 27:36.089
-Xosé.
-This is Xosé.

27:36.190 --> 27:38.009
-Hi there.
-Hi.

27:38.109 --> 27:39.200
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm good.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.099
-Been here long?
-No.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.190
Oh, okay. Good.

27:43.170 --> 27:44.200
-Shall we go in?
-Sure.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.119
I think it's this way.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.130
So how did you two meet?

27:51.150 --> 27:54.049
-At Gari's party.
-Ah, okay.

27:54.069 --> 27:56.150
-Because he's our gardener.
-Look, it's here.

27:57.039 --> 27:59.099
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.109
What's up?

28:02.130 --> 28:03.220
What are you doing?

28:04.049 --> 28:05.200
I'm going, this place is shit.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.039
You can't,
you paid for the whole weekend.

28:09.059 --> 28:11.009
Leave it out, okay?

28:11.029 --> 28:12.099
But did you sell anything?

28:12.119 --> 28:14.059
No, not a thing.

28:14.079 --> 28:17.000
All the more reason to stay
and try to sell something.

28:17.019 --> 28:18.119
If you go, you won't.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.079
-All right.
-I want to buy that one,

28:20.099 --> 28:21.170
-will you sell it to me?
-Cut it out.

28:21.190 --> 28:23.150
Hey, I love this one, I mean it.

28:23.170 --> 28:25.190
Wouldn't it look great in the
bathroom?

28:25.210 --> 28:27.009
How much is that?

28:27.029 --> 28:29.170
But... Do you think I'm an
idiot?

28:29.190 --> 28:31.130
I don't need your fucking
charity.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.079
Got a credit card reader?
I want to buy this one.

28:36.099 --> 28:38.160
-Stop.
-This is a market, I want to buy
it.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.049
-Leave it out, I said.
-I'm a customer.

28:41.069 --> 28:43.170
-Give me the painting...
-I want to buy it, I mean it!

28:44.150 --> 28:45.170
Sorry.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.130
Keep the painting,
keep all of them.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.150
-I'm fucking sick of this.
-Esther.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.150
Don't be like that, I wanted to
help.

28:54.230 --> 28:57.130
Help me?
You're gonna help me?

28:57.150 --> 28:59.190
Take a look at your life.
It's shit, María.

28:59.210 --> 29:01.089
-Help yourself.
-Esther...

29:01.109 --> 29:03.079
And you keep out of this!

29:09.039 --> 29:10.119
All right...

29:15.210 --> 29:16.220
Hi.

29:17.099 --> 29:19.039
Yeah. Where are you guys?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.009
Okay, cool. I'll join you.

29:22.029 --> 29:25.049
Do you have coke or should I
score some?

29:25.069 --> 29:28.140
Well, because I fancy it.
Okay, see you in a minute.

29:31.049 --> 29:33.069
-Can you manage?
-Yes, of course.

29:35.180 --> 29:37.130
I didn't mean like...

29:37.230 --> 29:39.099
Like what?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.039
Little macho man.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.160
-That isn't you?
-No.

29:44.019 --> 29:45.130
So how did you mean it?

29:45.150 --> 29:48.109
I guess you can carry
two or three paintings...

29:48.130 --> 29:50.119
if you're pregnant, right?

29:50.230 --> 29:52.190
And four or five, too.

29:55.140 --> 29:56.200
Great.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.079
In fact, there are...

30:00.220 --> 30:04.069
lots of things I can do
while I'm pregnant.

30:16.029 --> 30:18.000
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

30:18.019 --> 30:20.150
Does it turn you on that I'm
pregnant?

30:21.059 --> 30:23.029
-I hadn't thought about it.
-No?

30:23.049 --> 30:25.059
-No.
-Okay, perfect.

31:50.019 --> 31:51.210
-God.
-Are you all right?

31:51.230 --> 31:54.109
Yes, I'm bloody great.
