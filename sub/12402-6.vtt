WEBVTT

00:06.925 --> 00:09.135
We will be regaling our animation audience

00:09.219 --> 00:12.597
with the compelling story
of the <i>USS Indianapolis.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:17.644
The bloodiest, most grotesque shark tale
in all of written history, and beyond.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.562
But here's the Shyamalan,

00:19.646 --> 00:22.523
we'll be telling this whole tale
from the point of view

00:22.607 --> 00:25.235
of the ravenous man-eaters themselves.

00:25.318 --> 00:26.986
I'll send your waiter over.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.323
So, no notes.
What do you think of that?

00:30.406 --> 00:34.661
Bruce, [stutters]
I think I have to bow out of this project.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.121
I don't really understand what it is,

00:37.205 --> 00:39.666
and my plate is really full right now.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.752
Oh, shame on me,
going on about my passion project.

00:42.835 --> 00:45.046
I'm completely neglecting
my passion person.

00:45.129 --> 00:47.298
So tell me, how are you, my sweet,

00:47.382 --> 00:48.883
my lovely desert flower?

00:48.967 --> 00:50.510
It's a little crazy.

00:50.593 --> 00:53.721
One of the pugs,
he ripped his bee costume. And then...

00:53.805 --> 00:56.724
I have an appointment
with my life coach, and...

00:56.808 --> 00:59.727
I still need to get in a nap
before my set tonight.

00:59.811 --> 01:01.729
-I was gonna say you look tired.
-I do?

01:01.813 --> 01:02.981
I don't know. Do you?

01:03.064 --> 01:05.066
I don't know. [stammers] You said it.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.818
I wasn't listening to
the thing I was saying.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.278
I don't wanna get overwhelmed again.

01:08.361 --> 01:09.904
You can't. You're right.

01:09.988 --> 01:11.823
-You've gotta slow down.
-Am I going too fast?

01:11.906 --> 01:14.409
Everything's moving fast.
I can't keep track of anything.

01:14.492 --> 01:15.702
I'm getting scared, Maria.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.412
This is what I was worried about.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.789
I can't get back on that
Hollywood hamster wheel.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.040
Getting sick again.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.084
We can't afford to have you
slip back to those depths

01:23.167 --> 01:24.419
from which you emerged.

01:24.502 --> 01:25.670
I better just go.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.088
Yes. You go do you.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.216
[theme music playing]

01:38.933 --> 01:41.102
[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

01:44.397 --> 01:45.732
[Maria] Do I seem tired?

01:45.815 --> 01:48.276
Do I seem... sort of overworked...

01:48.359 --> 01:50.028
like, overwhelmed? Doing too much?

01:50.111 --> 01:52.113
Am I talking too fast? [inhales deeply]

01:52.196 --> 01:55.658
[slowly] Am I talking too fast?

01:55.742 --> 01:57.243
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

01:57.327 --> 01:58.786
You're an artist, right?

01:58.870 --> 02:01.789
Do you know what these
Hollywood fuck-faces want?

02:01.873 --> 02:05.376
They want to feed on your soul, okay?

02:05.460 --> 02:07.003
They're goddamn sexy vampires.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.631
They wanna <i>Twilight</i>
the shit out of your jugular.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.132
That's just what they wanna do.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.509
But you know what? I'm on Team Maria.

02:13.593 --> 02:15.845
So I say, "Nuh-uh,
you go and fuck yourself.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.139
You go and fuck your wolf faces."
You know?

02:18.222 --> 02:20.642
Because you know who never gets tired?

02:20.725 --> 02:23.811
And you know who never does talk too fast?

02:26.272 --> 02:27.982
-Who?
-Wolves.

02:28.066 --> 02:31.194
So I--
I should be more like a wolf?

02:31.277 --> 02:34.572
-Growl for me.
-[growling]

02:35.573 --> 02:36.574
No.

02:36.658 --> 02:37.909
Please stop. Stop it.

02:37.992 --> 02:41.162
Stop it.
You could've said no, and you didn't.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.456
-So you're not a wolf, okay?
-Interesting.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.208
You should see someone about this.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.793
-Okay.
-A specialist.

02:46.876 --> 02:49.087
-Great.
-And I want to say upfront

02:49.170 --> 02:50.463
you're going to want to fuck him.

02:50.546 --> 02:54.175
He's very handsome. He's very rugged.
He's very sexually generous.

02:54.258 --> 02:57.845
He's Karl Grisham,
and he is my twin brother.

02:57.929 --> 02:59.722
Oh.

02:59.806 --> 03:02.642
So is--
Is he a psychiatrist?

03:02.725 --> 03:04.143
Absolutely not.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.438
Okay. Well, here's your dog.

03:07.522 --> 03:08.815
Mmm-mmm, not mine.

03:08.898 --> 03:12.151
You could leave it on the desk,
and I'll find it some fruit.

03:13.820 --> 03:15.947
Maybe I'll take it with me.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.408
I'll just take her.

03:21.661 --> 03:22.787
Okay.

[doorbell rings]

03:34.507 --> 03:36.008
Hey, you found my dog!

03:36.092 --> 03:38.386
-Aw, look at this little lady.
-Okay.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.012
[Karl laughing] Cute.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.849
Listen, I know the reward said 500 bucks,

03:42.932 --> 03:46.185
but... what are you gonna do,
keep my dog?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.354
You'd be a total asshole.
Here's five bucks.

03:48.438 --> 03:50.982
No. Your sister sent me.
I have an appointment.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.150
My sister, huh?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.443
What's she wearing today?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.904
-What?
-Nothing. Sorry. Come on in.

03:58.823 --> 04:02.160
-So are you a life coach, or--
-Oh. No.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.786
Quite the opposite, actually.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.456
Okay. Oh, a death coach?

04:06.539 --> 04:08.916
Well, yeah. The death of productivity.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.544
[sighs] I'm a loaf coach.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.005
-[groans] Pull up a chair.
-Oh... Okay.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.715
So what's been going on?

04:15.798 --> 04:19.552
Well, I'm just worried about
triggering my bipolar mania.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.803
Getting a little busier,

04:20.887 --> 04:23.848
and I'm not sure how much is too much,
you know?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.768
Let's unwrap
and enjoy a stick of butter together.

04:26.851 --> 04:28.186
Okay. Huh.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.023
[slurping]

04:32.106 --> 04:34.275
I'm sorry, what is a loaf coach?

04:34.358 --> 04:37.153
-Oh. I'm gonna tell you a story.
-Oh.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.748

04:48.831 --> 04:53.252

04:53.336 --> 04:54.545

04:54.629 --> 04:57.799

04:57.882 --> 04:59.091
<i>You know who's to blame?</i>

04:59.175 --> 05:00.635
<i>Ben Franklin.</i>

05:00.718 --> 05:02.011
Hi, guys.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.346
[whooshing]

05:03.429 --> 05:04.680
The guy with the electricity?

05:04.764 --> 05:06.516
Yeah, and the condescending glasses.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.810
He didn't even need those.
They were for show.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.395
He was the original hipster fraud.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.065
Think about it.
He put buckles on his shoes?

05:14.148 --> 05:15.650
That ludicrous hairstyle?

05:15.733 --> 05:18.861
And the experiments
with the fuckin' kites and everything?

05:18.945 --> 05:22.198
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.
Eat a dick.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.825
Here's how this is gonna go down.

05:23.908 --> 05:26.911
I'm gonna shadow loaf you for 10 days.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.788
-It sounds like...
-[slurping]

05:28.871 --> 05:32.583
you got a solid program,
and I wanna follow through with it.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.043
I used to think more was more.

05:34.126 --> 05:38.923
But now, I realize, less...
is more of what I need.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.800
[chuckles] You know?

05:41.676 --> 05:43.594
[gasps] Sorry.

05:43.678 --> 05:45.846
I trained my body to sleep
with my eyes open.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.682
I call it Grisham Cryosleep.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.891
[inhales deeply]

05:48.975 --> 05:50.768
-Feels like we're done, right?
-Right.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.853
This was a good first sesh.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.272
-[exhales]
-Well done, Maria.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.439
-Thank you.

[Maria yawns]

06:03.281 --> 06:04.574
Hi, guys.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.410
Oh, boy.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.830
"Follow the rose petals
to a super surprise."

06:10.913 --> 06:12.331
Okay.

06:13.374 --> 06:16.127
So many rose petals.
Too much.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.212
Too soon.

06:18.296 --> 06:19.922
[shuddering]

06:20.840 --> 06:21.882
Good mornin', babe.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.634
Oh...

06:23.718 --> 06:25.094
Look, an omelet bar.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.431
Wow. You sure got the rose petals
in there.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.765
You're darn right I did.

06:29.849 --> 06:32.101
That's feta cheese and rose petal.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.936
-The kids get in tomorrow.
-Okay. Great.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.313
You're okay with them stayin'?

06:35.396 --> 06:38.316
Yes! I don't at all feel unnerved.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.860
I love kids and their faces and skins.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.612
I'm gonna get someone to hang out
with them

06:42.695 --> 06:43.696
since I have to work.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.033
Tell that person they
are gonna have to hang out with me, too.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.410
Because I'm spending all day
with your children.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.703
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.705
-You don't have to.
-I do have to,

06:52.788 --> 06:55.583
because I love being busy with kids.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.960
Have them bring friends.
Have their friends bring friends.

06:58.044 --> 07:00.796
You know what, can you
excuse me a moment?

07:00.880 --> 07:02.590
[muffled screaming]

07:05.343 --> 07:08.012
Maria, your kids are here.
We dropped them at craft services.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.847
I need you to sign your SAG paperwork.

07:09.931 --> 07:11.265
Okay, great.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.892
I didn't know you had kids.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.270
Well, they aren't mine.
They are my boyfriend/tenant's.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.439
But I treat them like mine. I adore them.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.441
Uh, did they say their names?

07:20.524 --> 07:22.443
I'm sorry about the sweat.
I just--

07:22.526 --> 07:24.528
My hands get sweaty when I'm around kids,

07:24.612 --> 07:27.907
'cause I love them.
It's innate within me to love children.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.660
I love them. I'm a mother.
Really, like a mother--

07:30.743 --> 07:34.497
Do you think Checklist is unethical?
Do you think what I'm doing is wrong?

07:34.580 --> 07:38.000
I AD'd a Mexican snuff movie,
so I'm not the one to ask.

07:38.084 --> 07:39.710
You're wearing a microphone.

07:39.794 --> 07:40.753
Oh.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.464
Yep. Got it.
Okay, I have eyes on her right now.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.174
We'd like to invite you to set.

07:45.257 --> 07:49.470
Do you have a towel or something...
Maybe I could wipe my hands on your hair?

07:49.553 --> 07:50.680
-Absolutely.
-Okay. Great.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.264
Okay, great.
And picture's up!

-Come here.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.083
Extras are so goddamn annoying.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.294
[Karen] Don't make eye contact.
That's gonna encourage him.

08:22.378 --> 08:24.588
Extras don't feel pain.
That's why they call them background.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.589
-Well...
-[cell phone vibrating]

08:25.673 --> 08:26.799
I gotta take this.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.677
It's my groomer. My dog's having
his anal glands expressed.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.221
Poor baby. You know what, though?

08:32.304 --> 08:34.724
It reminds me of what's
really important...

08:34.807 --> 08:36.767
Oh, mother fuck me!

08:36.851 --> 08:38.184
There's blood on my Louboutins.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.520
Can you believe this shit?

08:39.602 --> 08:42.356
At least the sole is red.
Good God. Go for Grisham.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.107
-How are the glands?
-[boy] Mommy!

08:45.317 --> 08:47.570
[distorted] Mommy! Mommy!

08:47.653 --> 08:51.323
What are we going to do today?

08:52.366 --> 08:55.244
Well, uh, hello, little ones...

Well, just hold on
for one sweet little second.

to Build-A-Bear in, like, ten years.

Yeah. Uh-huh.

Dad, is it cool if I work
on my essay for Wesleyan?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.504
[Graham] Absolutely, buddy.

09:46.587 --> 09:50.716

away from this room.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.306
It was super, super fun.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.475
-You're a nice lady, too.
-Mmm.

10:02.019 --> 10:05.564
[stammering] They seemed
so much smaller on the rides.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.982
You didn't have to do that.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.151
No, it was $4,000 well spent.

10:09.235 --> 10:12.363
I mean, it's just paper.
Where else am I gonna spend it?

10:12.446 --> 10:15.116
On adult things, like books, medicine
and shelter?

10:15.199 --> 10:16.367
No, thanks!

10:16.450 --> 10:19.703
You know what? This is for me,
I gotta get this.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.206
It's show business calling.
[imitates ringing]

10:22.289 --> 10:24.750
Hello? Yes?

10:24.834 --> 10:27.920
Oh, New York City? Oh, my gosh.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.172
Oh, wait... Tina Fey?

10:30.256 --> 10:32.091
No. Right away? No.

10:32.174 --> 10:35.803
No, right away?
No. I've got children here.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.680
My-- My children.

10:37.763 --> 10:42.143
One shot only.
Oh, I guess I have to do it. Later.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.522
You will not believe this, Graham.

10:47.106 --> 10:51.193
I just got a gig in New York City,
and I have to leave right away.

10:51.277 --> 10:52.945
Uh, I know. I know.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.947
I'm as peeved about it as you are.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.198
Okay. See you Monday.

10:56.282 --> 10:58.075
Aren't you gonna pack anything?

10:58.159 --> 11:00.744
Graham, it's New York! [laughs]

11:03.414 --> 11:06.667
<i>I didn't go to New York.</i>
<i>I went a quarter of a mile from home.</i>

11:06.750 --> 11:08.752
<i>I just needed some me time.</i>

11:08.836 --> 11:10.254
[muffled crying]

11:15.050 --> 11:17.928
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I felt like I had gone to New York.</i>

11:18.012 --> 11:20.389
<i>I felt sophisticated, cosmopolitan.</i>

11:20.472 --> 11:23.100
<i>I was a woman in charge of my world.</i>

11:23.183 --> 11:24.810
[cell phone vibrating]

11:27.229 --> 11:28.272
Hey.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.275
[Graham] Maria, I know you're
in New York right now.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.402
<i>Sorry, I'm on the set of</i> Dinosaur Priest.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.238
I know you're in New York working,
but we need to talk.

11:36.322 --> 11:39.366
<i>I think we're moving too fast.</i>
<i>Maybe I made a big mistake,</i>

11:39.450 --> 11:40.701
bringing the kids to LA.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.913
That thing you said about being their mom.
I love it, but...

11:43.996 --> 11:46.832
[stammering] maybe it's too much,
too soon.

11:46.916 --> 11:48.208
<i>I think we should slow down.</i>

11:48.292 --> 11:50.502
I should move out,
and we should take a break.

11:50.586 --> 11:54.006
Graham, I'm looking at the skyline
in New York, where I am...

11:54.089 --> 11:55.549
and I just think...

11:55.633 --> 11:57.927
how much time on this kooky blue marble
called Earth do we have?

11:58.010 --> 11:59.637
<i>Tomorrow is guaranteed to no one.</i>

11:59.720 --> 12:03.140
You say go slower, I say move faster.
Graham, will you marry me?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.099
Oh, my God.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.936
Yes! [chuckles] Yes.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.228
[laughing]

12:09.980 --> 12:11.607
Hold on.
Tina Fey's on the other line.

12:11.690 --> 12:12.900
[beeps]

12:14.944 --> 12:16.654
[muffled screaming]

12:18.656 --> 12:20.574
<i>So, I overcommitted in the past.</i>

12:20.658 --> 12:24.495
<i>That's why now I was determined</i>
<i>to master the art of doing nothing.</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:26.580

Look, I love your enthusiasm.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.794
But as a fan of Jungian motifs,

13:13.877 --> 13:16.839
you need to dig down
to the shadow side of the protagonist.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.298
John Truby.

13:18.382 --> 13:21.051
I took the Truby screenwriting seminar
in Del Mar.

13:21.135 --> 13:22.344
You didn't retain much.

13:22.428 --> 13:24.263
Trust your inner voice.

13:24.346 --> 13:28.100
Let that be the music of your song.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.560
I gotta go.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.603
Thank you, Rafael.

13:31.729 --> 13:36.608
"Trust your inner voice.
Let that be the music of your song."

13:36.692 --> 13:38.777
Yeah. Yeah.

13:39.445 --> 13:41.989
[Karl sighs] How you feeling?
Relaxed?

13:42.072 --> 13:44.366
Very relaxed, almost depressed.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.701
Then it's workin'.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.787
Soon, I'm gonna introduce you
to an involuntary catheter.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.289
-Hmm.
-[cell phone vibrating]

13:50.372 --> 13:52.041
-Oh.
-Ugh, enough with that thing.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.710
[gasps] It's Judd Apatow, super producer.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.837
[Karl] Ugh.
[Maria] He never calls me.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.757
I could blow off Bruce,
but this is Judd Apatow, the "A" man.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.551
The Apatow for destruction.
The tow truck.

14:02.634 --> 14:07.056
My Judd bud. Paul Rudd's Judd.
The fourth Judd.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.224
The... the <i>Return of the Juddi.</i>

14:09.308 --> 14:13.353
A person whose support I treasure,
as a champion of women in comedy,

14:13.479 --> 14:14.855
and of comedy in general.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.733
Mmm.
He's gone to voicemail.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.610
Yeah, good.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.695
-[inhales deeply]

14:25.824 --> 14:27.409
That's why he is the Juddernaut!

14:27.493 --> 14:29.453
All right, put it on the box.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.662
Hello?

14:30.746 --> 14:32.206
Hey, Maria, it's Judd callin'.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.582
<i>-What's up?</i>
-Uh, nothing.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.709
-Nothing at all.
-Right.

14:35.793 --> 14:37.211
<i>Well, I'm doing a new movie,</i>

14:37.294 --> 14:39.338
and I wrote a part in it just for you.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.340
You know that you called
Maria Bamford, right?

14:41.423 --> 14:42.508
Maria, you're doing that thing again.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.219
-What thing?
-That thing where you diminish yourself

14:45.302 --> 14:47.471
as a person and artist,
'cause you're afraid to accept

14:47.554 --> 14:48.931
that you have a unique and singular voice.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.391
Oh, that thing.

14:50.474 --> 14:51.850
I'm gonna tell you about the movie.

14:51.934 --> 14:55.521
It's a double crossover sequel
of <i>Bridesmaids</i> and <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

14:55.604 --> 14:57.439
Feig is in, and it is called...

14:57.523 --> 14:59.024
<i>Bridebusters?</i>

15:00.275 --> 15:02.361
Actually, no.
We never thought of that.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.822
Write that down, <i>"Brides... busters."</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:06.490
No. We're gonna go <i>Ghostmaids.</i>

15:06.573 --> 15:08.325
Ghostmaids.
<i>Okay, here's the thing.</i>

15:08.409 --> 15:10.077
<i>We've already got Melissa McCarthy,</i>

15:10.160 --> 15:11.328
<i>Wiig, Schumer,</i>

15:11.412 --> 15:15.207
and, in kind of a large supporting part,
Nancy Reagan.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.625
-Oh...
<i>-So, what do you say?</i>

15:16.708 --> 15:18.710
<i>-You wanna make a movie?</i>
-[mouthing] No.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.003
[whispering] Why not?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.339
Do you know how much work
this will lead to?

15:22.423 --> 15:25.008
Definite pass. No way.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.095
But it's a big movie with stars.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.265
Sometimes you have to say no to the best

15:31.348 --> 15:33.600
when you need the rest.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.102
[sighs] Goddamn it.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.812
Judd, I can't do it.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.522
<i>Give the part to a charity.</i>

15:38.605 --> 15:40.566
Like the downtown women's center.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.943
I can't give a job
to a downtown women's center,

15:43.026 --> 15:45.362
'cause it's an acting role for a person.

15:45.446 --> 15:46.530
<i>Are you freaking out again?</i>

15:46.613 --> 15:48.699
No. I'm healthier than I've ever been.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.993
Maybe go to her house
with some zinc lozenges

15:51.076 --> 15:53.203
and some old Mike Douglas DVDs.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.330
The ones with Totie Fields she likes.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.374
<i>Church is gonna come over</i>
<i>and follow up, okay?</i>

15:57.458 --> 16:00.252
No. You're the best. I need the rest.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.296
Thank you so much for thinking of me.

16:02.379 --> 16:06.884
I treasure you,
and I love you so very much. Buh-bye!

16:06.967 --> 16:09.720
<i>-Maria, don't! Stop thinking, plea--</i>
-Oh, God. Ugh.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
See, that wasn't hard. How do you feel?

16:11.889 --> 16:13.182
Deflated.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.642
Yeah.
You know what deflation is?

16:15.726 --> 16:19.438
Ambition just leaving your body.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.689
[sighs]

16:20.772 --> 16:23.233
Oh, it's so good to feel free
from success.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.401
[chuckles]

16:25.861 --> 16:29.072
[Maria] <i>I grew up in a family that was</i>
<i>obsessed with being productive.</i>

16:29.156 --> 16:30.491
<i>While I was recovering at home,</i>

16:30.574 --> 16:33.243
<i>my mother made me mentor a young comic.</i>

16:37.289 --> 16:42.044
So, Maria, I watched your stand-up,
and it was, like...

16:42.127 --> 16:43.629
it wasn't funny.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.342
That's wonderful feedback.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.012
What kind of comedy do you like to do?

16:52.095 --> 16:54.681
So, I like to change the words
to Katy Perry songs.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.141
So, here's one.

16:56.225 --> 17:00.646
Mr. Sherman's such a jerk.
He always gives us homework.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.940
Work, work, work.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.776
Oh. Okay, that's fun.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.362
All my friends say I'm so hilarious.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.281
And one time, I ate dog food at a party.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.201
Sorry to interrupt, hons.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.161
Your father and I
were cleaning out the attic.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.954
Not a euphemism.

17:18.038 --> 17:21.959
And look what we found... your violin.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.252
Play it and see if it still works.

17:24.336 --> 17:27.214
Mom, I hate that violin. Please burn it.

17:27.297 --> 17:32.886
Oh, Kristy, she played so beautifully
when she was just about your age.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.763
Won all the competitions.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.932
Come on, play it for Kristy.

17:37.015 --> 17:40.060
No, Mom... no violin.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.562
Oh, this one. [sighs]

17:41.687 --> 17:43.730
You'd think we held a gun to her head.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.983
All right, fine, I'll play it.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.112
Here are two of the world's
smallest violins, playing just for you.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.156
[Maria] Oh.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.452
That's not the gesture
you think it is, Mom.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.079
Oh, I can't do anything right.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.249
Ugh. Moms, right?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.918
-They're the worst.
-The total worst.

18:05.002 --> 18:09.923
So, your mom said
that you wanted to, um...

18:10.007 --> 18:13.302
-prepare for some contest at school?
-Yeah.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.139
The winner gets an Applebee's gift card
and is principal for the day.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.933
-I'm gonna make everyone eat dog food.
-[Maria] Doesn't it annoy you

18:20.017 --> 18:21.852
that your mom is making you sit here
with me?

18:22.561 --> 18:24.187
It's super annoying.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.940
And she cut down my allowance,
because we're,

18:27.024 --> 18:28.358
"barely scraping by."

18:28.442 --> 18:30.569
What a bitch.

18:31.069 --> 18:35.490
How would you like to stick it to your mom
and all the other moms out there

18:35.574 --> 18:38.785
who are forcing their kids
to do stuff they don't wanna do?

18:38.869 --> 18:40.579
Like, for example, play the violin.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.331
I would love it.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.999
When I am done with you,

18:44.082 --> 18:48.170
you are gonna have 20 tons
of comedy napalm

18:48.253 --> 18:51.048
to drop on Mrs. Coombs,

18:51.131 --> 18:55.510
or whatever name your mom
is calling herself by these days.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.554
Kablam!

18:57.638 --> 18:58.889
[imitates explosion]

19:00.515 --> 19:03.143
Take that, motherfucker!

19:03.226 --> 19:05.062
I love it. Send me that material?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.563
Yes, yes.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.070
Goddamn it, she's funny.

19:16.531 --> 19:18.367
Maria, hon, hi.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.411
Candy Coombs, Kristy's mom.

19:21.495 --> 19:24.331
[laughing] Oh, hi, Mrs. Coombs.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.958
Your mom went to the cellar
to grab some white wine.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.001
Mmm.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.753
We're celebrating.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.381
Kristy won her comedy contest.

19:32.464 --> 19:36.134
Oh, yeah. In your face, Mrs. Coombs!

19:36.218 --> 19:39.971
I brought you a gift
for helping mentor Kristy to victory.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.015
Hmm? It's candy.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.392
-[groans]
-Like my name.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.227
[chuckles] Candy.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.230
Yeah, I get it. [scoffs]

19:48.313 --> 19:52.150
It means the world that you were
willing to help mentor Kristy.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.944
Between you and me,

19:54.027 --> 19:56.738
I don't know how much time
I have left for Kristy.

19:57.572 --> 20:01.410
Oh, really?
Not much time left for your child?

20:01.493 --> 20:02.869
Six months if I'm lucky.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.372
I'm dying of pancreatic cancer.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.665
[gasps]

20:06.748 --> 20:08.709
Yeah. I haven't told Kristy yet.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.503
-[wheezing]
-It's stage four. [chuckles]

20:11.586 --> 20:14.715
Which is funny. That's the stage
she performed on last night.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.967
The reason I was pushing
for you to get involved

20:17.050 --> 20:21.638
is that I wanted to give Kristy a win
before I die, and she loses everything.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.141
We're having some
pretty serious money trouble.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.726
And I have no insurance.

20:25.809 --> 20:29.688
[sighs] I couldn't afford it
after her father shot himself. [chuckles]

20:29.771 --> 20:32.190
Oh, no. You must hate me.

20:32.274 --> 20:35.152
I helped your daughter develop an act
that was very critical.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.612
Watching that must've really hurt.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.281
Not really.

20:39.364 --> 20:43.034
I injected painkillers into my abdomen
so I could sit upright during her set.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.661
Oh, my God.

20:44.745 --> 20:48.248
Yeah, Kristy ripped me a new one.

20:48.331 --> 20:49.416
[both sigh]

20:49.499 --> 20:52.461
-But... that's okay.
-[groans]

20:52.544 --> 20:55.797
As long as she gets the victory,
I can take the hit.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.049
Because that's what moms do.
[clicks tongue]

20:58.133 --> 21:01.845
-[Candy groans]
-[Marilyn] Hey, Maria, you wanna join us?

21:01.928 --> 21:06.558
I'm just gonna pull some sausage
from the meat raffle out of the freezer.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.852
[sobs] I'm not worthy!

21:11.062 --> 21:13.064
Of freezer sausage?

21:13.982 --> 21:15.984
Somebody's getting their pyramid.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.447
[Maria playing violin]

21:31.500 --> 21:33.668
Oh, Maria, the violin.

21:33.752 --> 21:36.463
You still play like an angel.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.006
Mom, I wanted to tell you something.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.508
I haven't always been the easiest,

21:39.591 --> 21:43.178
and I just appreciate
everything that you've done,

21:43.261 --> 21:46.681
and everything that I know
you'll continue to do.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.934
And... I, uh...

21:49.976 --> 21:53.063
Thank you for taking
all the hits all these years.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.273
Oh, you're welcome, honey.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.526
You're welcome. [sniffles]

22:04.074 --> 22:05.659
Do you wanna burn that thing?

22:05.742 --> 22:08.078
Yes. Yes.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.540
Okay, let's go out back to the trash can
and torch it hobo style.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.624
[laughing] Yeah.

22:12.707 --> 22:14.876
We'll get some of your dad's gayer shirts,

22:14.960 --> 22:17.128
-and we'll destroy them too.
-Oh, great.

22:17.212 --> 22:21.258
-[Marilyn] Which ones do you wanna pick?
-Well, that one that's orange plaid...

22:33.812 --> 22:36.189
-I gotta go to Phoenix.
-Why you gotta go to Phoenix?

22:36.273 --> 22:38.149
-'Cause he's in Paris.
-What?

22:38.233 --> 22:40.694
Joaquin Phoenix.
He needs my help in Paris.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.572
-Paris Hilton?
-What? Maria, don't be gross.

22:43.655 --> 22:46.157
He's having a total mid-loaf crisis.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.742
[chuckles] Needs my help.

22:47.826 --> 22:50.078
Time to pay the bills, know what I mean?

22:50.161 --> 22:52.330
You specifically said
not to pay the bills.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.125
I was being metaphorical, Maria.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.710
Everybody has to pay their bills.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.129
In fact, you owe me $10,000.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.255
-[gasps]

23:00.338 --> 23:02.382
Ooh! That's my Uber. Okay.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.968
[Karl] Keep doing this until I get back.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.596
-You're doing great.
-No, no.

23:07.679 --> 23:11.558
No, no, no, no.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.435

23:20.233 --> 23:21.568
-Maria.
-Yeah. [stammers]

23:21.651 --> 23:23.737
I told you not to come here
without asking.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.946
-Okay.
-You have to call ahead.

23:25.030 --> 23:25.864
Yes.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.782
-Ooh, but I'm here.
-You are.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.534
Is there something you need?

23:29.618 --> 23:33.496
I was wrong. I was, uh...
just doing a bit when I said no.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.249
'Cause, I-- I love comedy.
You love comedy.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.710
Let's... let's work together. [exclaims]

23:38.793 --> 23:40.587
[sighs] I have bad news.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.340
-No.
-I just gave the part to Sarah Silverman,

23:43.423 --> 23:45.091
like, 13 seconds ago.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.260
No! [inhales]

23:47.344 --> 23:48.553
Oh, she's so good. Okay.

23:48.637 --> 23:50.305
-So good.
-Okay.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.224
Couldn't you just call...
takebacksies, Judd?

23:53.308 --> 23:54.434
-Here's the thing.
-Yes.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.685
-I hate to say this.
-Yeah.

23:55.769 --> 23:58.146
In this business...
there are no takebacksies.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.356

and I got fucked.

24:03.568 --> 24:04.611
[softly] I don't wanna get fucked.

24:04.694 --> 24:07.947
You are a man of honor,
and I will fix this.

No way.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.873
Hey, you guys.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.417
I was just in the neighborhood.
It's so crazy.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.170
You look so pretty, Sarah.
So do you, Tig. Um...

24:22.253 --> 24:26.091
I heard you are in the new Judd movie.
So cool.

24:26.174 --> 24:29.094
Hey, I was just wondering,
could I have the part?

24:29.177 --> 24:30.970
Because you have everything.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.847
You have a hot English boyfriend.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.016
You're Jewish, which is so cool.

24:35.100 --> 24:39.062
And I was just thinking, I need the part.
I really need it.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.481
I'll make you a deal.

24:44.275 --> 24:48.363
Find all 25 items on that
25-item scavenger hunt list

24:48.446 --> 24:50.407
in two hours, the part's yours.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.617
[gasps] Okay, thank you, so...

24:52.701 --> 24:56.329
Why do you have a scavenger hunt list
just lying around?

24:56.413 --> 24:59.457
Maria, I'm high all the time,
what am I supposed to do?

24:59.541 --> 25:02.210
Yeah, I'm totally high right now.
Just hanging out.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.003
I don't even have a line in this scene.

25:05.088 --> 25:10.135
Okay. Clock time starts...

AKA a billionaire, right, Tig?

26:10.487 --> 26:12.322
Yeah, we're all very rich.

I love you so much!

Thank you. I owe you forever.

I started out, I got a loaf coach,

26:45.814 --> 26:48.107
thinking I needed to slow down.
Now I realize

26:48.191 --> 26:51.277
I needed to learn how
to take care of myself,

26:51.361 --> 26:53.780
you know, to be a mother to me.

of far greater importance.
