WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.467
Let this motherfucker party
begin!

00:13.300 --> 00:16.233
This time we are back
where we belong.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.533
Newcastle.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.267
With our friends.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.333
And family.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.567
Yoo-hoo!
Nana!

00:26.700 --> 00:29.133
Doing the things we love.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.167
There'll be some new faces.
Hello!

00:34.233 --> 00:36.200
Plenty of old faces.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.633
Aussie Aussie Aussie!

00:38.700 --> 00:40.833
And one big blast from the past.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.800
Long time, no fucking see!

00:44.800 --> 00:45.933
But don't worry.

00:47.033 --> 00:49.933
We're still proper radge.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Which means getting inebriated.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.367
You mean mortal.

00:56.433 --> 00:59.033
Lots of fornication.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.400
Shagging, you divvy.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.300
Hello!

01:03.367 --> 01:05.700
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.000
(screaming)

01:10.067 --> 01:11.933
Fuck off! Now!

01:12.000 --> 01:15.567
# Baby, you're the reason
I can't shake this feeling

01:15.633 --> 01:18.100
# I know that you're feeling it
too #

01:19.133 --> 01:20.667
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:20.733 --> 01:21.767
(cheering)

01:21.833 --> 01:24.100
Gonna be pure fucking belter.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.833
Tonight is our games night.

01:28.900 --> 01:33.267
If you can't arch your back
more,
I understand why you're single.

01:33.333 --> 01:36.000
What's got into Faith?
It's out of order.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.967
Adam is more interested in
pulling
than in our friendship.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.200
Who the fuck?

01:43.267 --> 01:45.800
Friends need housesitters
in Benidorm.

01:45.867 --> 01:48.000
My nana is in Benidorm.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.600
This villa is unbelievable.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.800
(cheering)

01:56.300 --> 02:00.967
We're all here in Benidorm,
yet they keep separating
themselves.

02:01.033 --> 02:04.033
People down here.
We need to cut them first.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.400
Don't get upset over pizza.
You're not getting jealous, are
you?

02:08.467 --> 02:12.500
I can't believe I hit Sam
and I fell out with my best
mate.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.900
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:15.967 --> 02:17.833
I'm preened to perfection.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.733
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.733
I've got more cheek
that a girl with fillers.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.533
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.567
I'm happy-go-lucky,
bit of a Jack the lad.

02:29.633 --> 02:32.300
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:32.367 --> 02:34.900
What you see is what you get.
Fun.

02:34.967 --> 02:38.067
I cannae believe anyone
would put me in charge.

02:38.133 --> 02:40.267
Geordie Shore. Why aye!

02:55.233 --> 02:57.400
What a fucking night.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.067
I know. What the hell happened?

03:00.133 --> 03:03.867
What happened last night?
My best friend hit my boyfriend.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.033
Now I'm in the middle.
What was Sophie thinking?

03:07.100 --> 03:10.433
I didn't say anything, then got
hit.
Unprovoked.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.100
She can say sorry
and I'll be sound with her,

03:14.167 --> 03:17.433
but I'm not gonna pretend to
play
happy families.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.100
After that, I'm not interested
no more.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.267
Sophie went too far last night.

03:22.333 --> 03:26.933
She's been on my back for too
long.
Last night was the final straw.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.233
You've gotta understand as well,
like, it's hard in here for me.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.533
Because, like, you're my
boyfriend
and these are me friends.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.633
I really hope Sam and Sophie
are gonna make up

03:38.700 --> 03:41.433
because I am in
such an awkward position.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.433
Last night, also,
Nathan was arguing with me.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.533
Who the fuck on their right mind
gets back, cooks pizzas

03:48.600 --> 03:50.833
and starts slicing bits?

03:50.900 --> 03:54.733
I wanna get the pizza, rip it
apart
and put it in my mush.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.767
It feels like we are separated
from the gang.

03:57.833 --> 04:02.333
Sophie punched me and Nathan
kicked off at Chloe for no
reason.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.833
Is it me or is everyone else
deluded?

04:07.933 --> 04:09.200
Oh, my God.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.200
What the fuck happened?

04:12.267 --> 04:15.067
I've woken up this morning
so hungover.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.399
But I've gotta see what's going
on,

04:17.466 --> 04:20.033
cos it got out of hand
last night.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.833
I've gotta apologise
for raising my hand,

04:22.900 --> 04:24.933
but I can't be arsed with him.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.600
I know I was in the wrong,
but jealous?

04:27.667 --> 04:31.533
What am I jealous about?
I'm quite happy with things.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.800
I just hate to see my friend
Chloe
upset.

04:34.867 --> 04:39.233
My problem isn't so much with
Sam.
My argument most was with her.

04:39.300 --> 04:43.433
Sometimes it does frustrate me,
like, when them two are awful,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.467
she's my best friend.
"Oh, you're my bestie."

04:46.533 --> 04:50.867
And the second they're good,
it's like, "Hi, Sam. Love you,
Sam."

04:50.933 --> 04:53.600
Me and Chloe are supposed to be
besties,

04:53.667 --> 04:55.900
but she only wants me to cry on.

04:55.967 --> 04:59.300
When her and Sam are fine,
she's nowhere to be seen.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.667
It's gonna be awkward at
breakfast.

05:01.733 --> 05:05.100
Confrontation is something
I'm very used to in here.

05:05.167 --> 05:08.833
I have had my fair share of
drama
in this house already.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.567
But last night was awful.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.967
It's not us.
We're not the problem.

05:13.033 --> 05:15.767
Cos we're all here together.
It's them.

05:15.833 --> 05:19.033
This has a bad effect on the
house.
I've never -

05:19.100 --> 05:21.833
Oh. Was that a fanny fart?
Yeah.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.733
I'm regretting letting you sleep
in my bed. I really am.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.133
My nose is blocked from the
flight.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.367
I think that's disgusting
what you've just done.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.467
I know. I agree, if I'm honest.

05:33.533 --> 05:38.367
It smells like the Tyne at low
tide.
Let's get out and make some
brekkie.

05:38.433 --> 05:41.100
Eugh. Look at the make up
on her pillow.

05:41.167 --> 05:42.167
Tramp.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.033
Oh, Adam!

05:48.100 --> 05:51.567
Morning, kid!
What a sexy man you are.
(chuckles)

05:51.633 --> 05:55.500
Last night it all kicked off.
I'm just pleased to keep out.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.833
I hope it gets sorted
and we can enjoy the holiday.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.300
What are you gonna do?
Are yous gonna speak or not?

06:02.367 --> 06:05.367
Oh... Not sure?
Just can't be arsed.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.533
Oh. What you doing?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.800
Cleaning the pool.

06:22.667 --> 06:26.533
Oh, he's coming out.
I've got you some brekkie here.

06:28.233 --> 06:32.833
There's a big elephant in this
room.
Is Sophie gonna apologise or
what?

06:32.900 --> 06:36.233
Nathan, what are you doing?
I'm cleaning the pool.

06:36.300 --> 06:40.467
After all the drama last night,
I'm keeping myself to myself.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.400
I can't be arsed with Chloe.

06:42.467 --> 06:45.800
Come over here and give us
a fucking hand, will you?

06:45.867 --> 06:49.333
Adam's tried his best,
but the atmosphere stinks.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.433
Nathan is blanking us. Sam and
Sophie can't look at each other.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.233
This is my worst nightmare.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.833
Hey. Fucking hell.
It's a bit awkward, this.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.100
This is the most awkward
breakfast
I've ever had.

07:02.167 --> 07:05.400
We need to bring the family
back together.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.567
Yous is so hot.
Oh, fuck.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
(phone rings)

07:14.533 --> 07:15.533
Hello?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.500
Oh, hi, Anna.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.433
I know. I feel so bad.
I don't know what got into us.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.333
I'm sorry.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.233
A drinking ban is bad.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.167
But one in Benners? That is
harsh.

07:44.233 --> 07:47.100
But it serves us right
for hitting Sam.

07:51.267 --> 07:55.533
As we're off to the beach, it
seems
a good idea to get my nana out.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.067
Howay.
Shall we go?

07:57.133 --> 07:58.833
Let's go to the beach.

08:08.967 --> 08:13.467
We have just arrived at the
beach
and the atmosphere is pretty
shite.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.033
Abbie! Hiya!

08:19.100 --> 08:22.133
Hang on a minute.
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.833
No, it's Abbie's nana!

08:23.900 --> 08:26.533
Hiya!
Oh, my God!

08:26.600 --> 08:28.900
Hiya! Are you all right?

08:28.967 --> 08:29.967
Hi, Nana!

08:30.033 --> 08:35.033
How are you? Are you all right?
Yeah. Are you? Do you want a
croggy?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.033
Never fear. Nana's here.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.067
I'll show you young
whippersnappers
how to party in Beni.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.732
Ooh. Style it.

08:43.866 --> 08:45.867
I'm so glad that Nana made it.

08:45.933 --> 08:50.367
The atmosphere has totally
lifted
and it's nice to see some
smiles.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.600
I wanna go in the sea.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.700
I love swimming, me.
I'm gonna come with you.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.233
This is my first holiday
away from home

09:05.300 --> 09:07.700
and I am determined to have a
laugh.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.933
I think it's about time I got
some sun cream on you, treacle.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.500
How's that for you?
Charisma.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.933
Ooh. I feel as though I'm in
Ghost!

09:28.033 --> 09:32.400
Get off her. Howay, Christine.
You need to cool down after
that.

09:32.467 --> 09:36.500
I'm not sure I can stomach this
and I don't think Nana can.

09:36.567 --> 09:38.000
She's overheating.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.067
Oh!
Ooh!

09:40.133 --> 09:41.600
Ooh.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.033
She's got more crack than you.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.833
Fuck off! I was rinsing you dry
last night.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.967
I know you were.

09:48.033 --> 09:52.233
You know what, Abbie? It's nice
me and you can have a laugh now

09:52.300 --> 09:54.633
and we're not involved in the
drama.

09:54.700 --> 09:59.167
We're in a good place. It's so
nice
to have a laugh without any
drama.

09:59.233 --> 10:03.700
I don't know what is gonna
happen.
I hope they make up. I hate
drama.

10:03.767 --> 10:07.300
I hope they sort it out
cos I feel there is a divide.

10:07.367 --> 10:10.567
I mean, Adam, we're in Benidorm
on our holidays.

10:10.633 --> 10:14.533
No one should be arguing.
Honestly, Abbie, it's fucking
shit.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.733
The family is all over the
place.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.867
Sam and Chloe on one side
and Nathan and Chloe on the
other.

10:25.867 --> 10:28.700
After last night,
I need to speak to Chloe.

10:28.767 --> 10:32.633
She's in a difficult position.
I need her to hear my side.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.733
What happened last night?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.233
This morning, like,
he was in shock.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.367
He just didn't understand
when you punched him and stuff.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.200
Punching's out of order.

10:44.267 --> 10:46.633
Why would he think I'm jealous,

10:46.700 --> 10:50.333
when, in reality,
I think she can do better?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.700
I know Sophie doesn't want us
to get hurt.

10:53.767 --> 10:57.000
The thing that hurts is that
she hit my boyfriend

10:57.067 --> 10:59.100
and she needs to make it right.

10:59.167 --> 11:02.000
What do you reckon
they're talking about?

11:02.067 --> 11:04.967
What the hell has Sophie got to
say
to Chloe?

11:05.033 --> 11:08.967
I'm the one that got hit.
She should be talking to me.

11:09.033 --> 11:11.367
It's out of order.
It is, mate.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.133
I just think, for your sake,
I will make it up with him.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.533
I'll talk to him cos it's
awkward.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.533
I don't want you to think
you're second best.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.333
I'll always have your back.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.200
I feel so much better.
Me and Chloe are OK.

11:26.267 --> 11:29.500
I will apologise to Sam.
I shouldn't have hit him.

11:29.567 --> 11:32.033
But that comment was out of
order.

11:32.100 --> 11:36.400
You and Nathan not speaking
doesn't help. It's a big divide.

11:36.467 --> 11:38.667
I don't even know what I've
done.

11:38.733 --> 11:41.567
He said sometimes when you argue
with Sam,

11:41.633 --> 11:43.667
you and him are close.

11:43.733 --> 11:47.967
But then when you and Sam are
OK,
he's like, "Where's she gone?"

11:48.033 --> 11:51.167
Why have all my mates got a
problem
with Sam?

11:51.233 --> 11:54.200
They're my best pals.
Why can't they be happy?

11:54.267 --> 11:57.833
If he wants to speak to us,
he can, but I'm not.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.067
I'm not gonna argue over a
pizza.
It was shit.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.333
How old are you?!
22. How old are you?

12:16.400 --> 12:20.300
22. Why are you making
sandcastles?
This one's therapeutic.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.600
Look at that.
That's actually good.

12:22.667 --> 12:26.667
We may be at the beach together,
but the atmosphere is weird.

12:26.733 --> 12:29.367
This is meant to be
a fun family day out.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.700
I feel like Sophie must feel
so awkward.

12:32.767 --> 12:36.700
To be honest, what she done
was embarrassing, you know?

12:36.767 --> 12:38.633
It's a bit uncomfortable.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.733
Sophie hasn't spoken to Sam.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.000
Until then, the family has got
a massive divide.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.767
I can't be through with it
until she explains herself.

12:47.833 --> 12:50.200
Then that's sort of that, isn't
it?

12:50.267 --> 12:52.967
Me and you'll go home.
Come on. Howay.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.767
We're gonna go home.
We'll see yous out.

12:58.833 --> 13:01.967
Are you sure?
Yeah, we'll see yous tonight,
mate.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.967
Right. See yous in a bit.
See yous later. Bye.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.567
There they go.
It's Sam and Chloe time.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.300
They're ditching us again.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.033
To Nana!

13:15.100 --> 13:17.300
They need to make up and move
on.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.000
Let's water the plants!
Fancy some champers?

13:24.067 --> 13:26.800
Oh. Dirty bastard.

13:26.867 --> 13:27.867
(retches)

13:28.900 --> 13:30.600
Geordie Shore. Why aye!

13:33.000 --> 13:33.200
.

13:35.700 --> 13:35.900
.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.833
We've had an awkward day
at the beach.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.233
Sam and Chloe have gone home
early.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.633
Let's hope that Nana
can lift everyone's spirits.

13:54.700 --> 13:58.600
There were arguments between
Sophie,
Nathan, Sam and Chloe.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.033
It's just been a bit shit today,

14:01.100 --> 14:04.133
so I think they've been upset
and fucked off.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.400
Listen, y'all need to stop.

14:06.467 --> 14:09.000
No arguing.
You need all to be friends.

14:09.067 --> 14:12.000
You all live together,
so it's not worth it.

14:12.067 --> 14:17.100
These guys need to realise that
life
is too short for petty
arguments.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.300
They need to make up and move
on.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.333
Cheers!
To Nana!

14:22.500 --> 14:23.500
To Nana!

14:23.567 --> 14:25.533
Nana!

14:38.533 --> 14:41.967
So, what got said?
She feels bad about hitting you.

14:42.033 --> 14:45.300
She hit you because you made
the jealous comment.

14:45.367 --> 14:49.067
I think my jealousy comment
hit a nerve with Sophie.

14:49.133 --> 14:53.100
But if she wasn't jealous,
why would she react like that?

14:53.167 --> 14:54.633
That's my opinion.

14:54.700 --> 14:58.167
I definitely don't think
she's jealous of me and you.

14:58.233 --> 15:02.900
I think she made a point today.
She just wants me to be happy.

15:02.967 --> 15:06.700
I've got Sophie saying one thing
and Sam saying another.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.233
I don't really care!
Just make friends!

15:09.300 --> 15:12.633
It's so awkward for us
cos yous are both arguing.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.933
I'm not arguing.
I mean yous argued last night.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.300
Have a chat and finally squash
this.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.000
If you don't want to be friends,
drop it.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.000
We want to enjoy our time.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.600
I don't want this to ruin
the holiday,

15:25.667 --> 15:29.467
but Sophie has got to apologise
because she's in the wrong.

15:29.533 --> 15:32.033
Whatever happens, we're in it
together.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.767
Let's get some food and get
ready.
Come on, good looking.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.400
We're back at the villa.

15:41.467 --> 15:44.467
Nana has put some perspective
on the situation.

15:44.533 --> 15:48.267
Let's hope they sort their shit
out.
Now let's get ready.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.700
Girls!
Yeah?

16:03.767 --> 16:05.500
Come on. We're going.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.767
Girls.
We're coming!

16:07.833 --> 16:11.967
The atmosphere is not good.
I just need to bite the bullet.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.433
I'd like to apologise for last
night.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.333
It was out of order.
Violence is not good.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.367
I am sorry for raising my hand.

16:19.433 --> 16:20.767
Finally, an apology!

16:20.833 --> 16:24.033
She took her time with it,
but I do appreciate it.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.700
I just wish she could have done
it
first thing.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.000
I'm on a drinking ban tonight,
so I'll be quiet.

16:31.067 --> 16:33.400
I want yous to have a drink for
me.

16:33.467 --> 16:37.433
I just hope that's the end of
it,
so I can enjoy me night.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.967
Cheers!

16:39.033 --> 16:40.400
Howay, then.

16:47.867 --> 16:52.800
I think that was nice of Sophie,
apologising in front of
everyone.

16:52.867 --> 16:55.433
She's done it.
That took the edge off.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.633
Sophie's apology was
appreciated,

16:57.700 --> 17:01.100
but I feel like we need to chat
to put this to bed.

17:09.532 --> 17:13.233
We get in the club
and I'm on a mission to get
mortal.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.200
I cannot be arsed
with all this drama.

17:27.933 --> 17:32.000
I can't believe I'm on
a fucking drinking ban in Beni.

17:32.067 --> 17:35.200
Me mouth is so dry
it's like the Sahara desert.

17:35.267 --> 17:36.667
I'm parched.

17:54.767 --> 17:57.033
It's great having fun with Adam.

17:57.100 --> 18:01.100
We're just friends and
we can just have a laugh
together.

18:13.900 --> 18:17.633
We've been here before
with these two stubborn
bastards.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.767
They just need to sort it out.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.600
I've got bigger problems with
Sam.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.700
I will apologise to Chloe,

18:27.767 --> 18:31.200
but she's already half cut,
so I'm not doing it now.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.867
I get that Sam and Chloe
have their problems.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.167
Every couple does.

18:56.233 --> 18:59.000
But I don't want Sophie to get
too involved

18:59.067 --> 19:01.200
cos it could blow up in her
face.

19:12.367 --> 19:16.033
As far as I'm aware,
Sophie has apologised and that's
it.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.967
I want the whole family
to have a good night.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.567
Even though Chloe's mortal,

19:34.633 --> 19:37.333
it's great that she realises
it's stupid

19:37.400 --> 19:39.100
and that they need to talk.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.467
Finally, a proper chat.

19:58.533 --> 20:01.733
Hopefully, they'll sort it,
cos I'm in the middle.

20:20.967 --> 20:24.033
I get that Sophie only hears
the negatives,

20:24.100 --> 20:28.367
but every couple has problems,
so why can't she let us work it
out?

20:46.267 --> 20:49.333
In the past, I've seen Sam
treat Chloe bad.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.733
I can't forget that.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.033
Even if Chloe can.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.033
That's because she's head over
heels
over him.

21:05.733 --> 21:08.900
I understand Sophie's looking
out
for her mate,

21:08.967 --> 21:12.800
but we both love Chloe and
we both want what's best for
her.

21:21.467 --> 21:25.800
I'll give the benefit of the
doubt.
I just want to see Chloe happy.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.900
If she's happy, then I'm happy.

21:31.700 --> 21:34.867
It looks like Sophie and Sam
have sorted it out.

21:34.933 --> 21:37.600
I hope I can enjoy
the rest of my holiday.

21:42.933 --> 21:45.267
(cheering)

21:50.567 --> 21:53.200
As banging as this club is,
we're mortal.

21:53.267 --> 21:55.800
Let's get back
and carry on the party.

21:58.767 --> 22:01.533
Sexy bastards.
I feel...

22:04.167 --> 22:05.733
Ow! Me arm!

22:11.800 --> 22:14.167
Aw. Get me some fucking scran.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.167
Another great night in Beni.

22:16.233 --> 22:20.533
The family is finally back
together
and we are all mortal.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.867
Let's water the plants!

22:24.167 --> 22:27.600
One bite! One bite!
One bite! One bite!

22:27.667 --> 22:29.200
All of it.

22:32.733 --> 22:34.300
(cheering)

22:34.367 --> 22:37.700
That orchid looks very dry
and very thirsty.

22:37.767 --> 22:39.100
Fancy some champers?

22:39.167 --> 22:40.167
(cheering)

22:42.867 --> 22:45.900
Well, this is rather awkward.

22:45.967 --> 22:49.733
It's safe to say Chloe's not
employee of the month.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.300
I tell you what -
Have this champagne.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.133
I am out my fucking head.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.967
Why am I throwing salt at
Nathan?
Does he like chips?

22:58.033 --> 22:59.733
No, Nathan.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.200
You want to fuck on me?

23:02.267 --> 23:03.433
Nathan!

23:03.500 --> 23:08.100
Sam, you think you're the big
man
with the salt. Want some
vinegar?

23:08.167 --> 23:10.600
(retches)
Go on! Get them!

23:10.667 --> 23:13.200
(retches)
(laughter)

23:13.267 --> 23:16.500
Maybe that was a bad idea.
(retches)

23:21.600 --> 23:22.667
(retches)

23:22.733 --> 23:25.800
Oh! Dirty bastard!

23:25.867 --> 23:26.867
Stop it.

23:30.167 --> 23:33.933
Oh, my God. These radgies are
gone.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.833
And I'm sober. So I'm off to
kip.

23:42.433 --> 23:44.167
Hello.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.867
Hello.

23:45.933 --> 23:47.467
I'm as mortal as Chloe,

23:47.533 --> 23:51.900
so now seems like the perfect
time
to sort out all our problems.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.100
I'd like to start by saying -

24:03.167 --> 24:04.467
(coughs)

24:05.933 --> 24:07.933
Sorry. I was just coughing up -

24:11.000 --> 24:13.400
No, it was me coughing up my
pride.

24:13.467 --> 24:14.467
(splashing)

24:19.733 --> 24:23.400
These two are mortal.
They're not gonna make up
tonight.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.100
Come on, Chlo. Bed.

24:25.167 --> 24:26.167
Goodnight.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.400
Goodnight. Goodnight.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.933
Let's get a splash for some
gash.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.233
I love getting wet.

24:42.867 --> 24:45.667
Fuck me. I am not going on that.

24:45.733 --> 24:47.633
I need to go for a poo.

24:47.700 --> 24:51.033
Are you pissed?
No. Well, maybe a daiquiri or
two.

24:52.100 --> 24:53.600
Geordie Shore. Why aye!

24:56.467 --> 24:56.667
.

24:59.167 --> 24:59.367
.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.867
I've woken up and don't want to
waste any tanning time.

25:19.933 --> 25:22.433
So me and Faith are getting
in the sun.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.633
Morning. Good morning, cherub.
How are you?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.000
Morning, baby girls.

25:28.067 --> 25:32.433
I can't lie in that. I'll sit
here.
It's hot, innit? Yeah.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.867
Nathan, did you and Chloe make
up
last night?

25:35.933 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, but it was kind of like...

25:39.033 --> 25:43.167
It was silly cos we were both
drunk.
We just skimmed over things.

25:43.233 --> 25:45.467
I'm not gonna draw attention to
it.

25:45.533 --> 25:48.333
I don't see the point in
dragging it out.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.633
I get that, but you do need a
talk.

25:50.700 --> 25:54.300
More than it being -
Yous were both drunk last night.

25:54.367 --> 25:57.467
There is no way that those two
made up properly.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.233
They were both fucked.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.500
At least I made up with Sam.

26:01.567 --> 26:04.100
And then I went,
"Just to let you know

26:04.167 --> 26:06.500
I haven't got anything against
you,

26:06.567 --> 26:09.733
just your relationship,
I've got an opinion on."

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
As far as I'm concerned,
me and Sam are fine.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.633
We both said our piece
and we can move on.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.567
I do think it was right that
you apologised

26:18.633 --> 26:20.367
and was the bigger person.

26:20.433 --> 26:21.467
Yeah.

26:21.533 --> 26:23.200
I'm fucking sweating, me.

26:23.267 --> 26:27.700
I'm gonna dip my legs in the
pool.
Fucking hot, mate.

26:31.033 --> 26:33.133
Some domestic goddess you are.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.933
The one that pissed all over
the plants last night. Fuck me.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.700
Why aye.
What plant?

26:39.767 --> 26:40.900
Some outside.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.733
The ones we're meant to be
looking after.

26:43.800 --> 26:48.000
Apparently, it needed some
water.
Did I give it a golden shower?

26:48.067 --> 26:51.800
Is it good for the plants or
bad?
Probably good, like.

26:51.867 --> 26:55.367
That's why I did it.
Cos I'm a domesticated goddess!

26:55.433 --> 26:57.200
What about you and Nathan?

26:57.267 --> 27:01.100
So, to be honest,
I'm gonna be completely
truthful,

27:01.167 --> 27:02.833
I don't remember a thing.

27:02.900 --> 27:06.100
I can't remember what me and
Nathan
talked about.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.700
I think we made up,
but I'm not sure.

27:08.767 --> 27:12.500
It's a good jolly day.
It's a good day to be alive.

27:12.567 --> 27:16.467
You made up with Sophie,
so I'm not in the middle
anymore.

27:16.533 --> 27:20.533
After chatting to Sophie,
we can move on from her hitting
me

27:20.600 --> 27:23.167
and get on with this trip
in Benidorm.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.400
Sam. Chloe. Adam. Come on!

27:27.467 --> 27:28.600
Yous coming then?

27:28.667 --> 27:31.967
All right, Abbie.
Let's see what the craic is.

27:32.033 --> 27:33.833
Good morning. Good morning.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.100
Good morning, friends and
family.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.933
Can you remember pissing on
the orchids?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.533
I don't think I want to.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.867
All jokes aside, right,

27:44.933 --> 27:48.433
how do yous feel about going to
the waterpark? Yes!

27:48.500 --> 27:52.900
That's a fucking cracking idea.
I love waterparks and getting
wet.

27:52.967 --> 27:55.167
Come on then. Without further
ado.

27:55.233 --> 27:57.833
Let's get our fucking swimming
gear
on.

27:57.900 --> 28:02.033
What better way to get over
a hangover than go to a
waterpark?

28:02.100 --> 28:03.800
Jolly times!

28:09.633 --> 28:12.800
Come on then.
See yous at the park, bitches.

28:12.867 --> 28:13.967
Ta-ta.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.867
Oi, yous, I can see the
waterpark.
We're here!

28:19.933 --> 28:21.433
(cheering)

28:21.500 --> 28:23.333
Oh, my God. It looks sick.

28:24.333 --> 28:28.100
Howay, gang. Let's get a splash
for some gash.

28:28.167 --> 28:31.367
We've arrived at the park
and it looks amazing.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.033
Get me on those rides.

28:39.067 --> 28:40.267
What the hell?!

28:40.333 --> 28:41.533
(screams)

28:52.933 --> 28:55.133
Fuck me! That is a massive
slide.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.467
I am not going on that.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.067
All right then. Howay.

29:06.867 --> 29:10.233
Everyone knows I do not poo or
fart
in front of Sam.

29:10.300 --> 29:14.067
But I just went down a slide
and nearly shat myself.

29:14.133 --> 29:15.633
Kill me now.

29:15.700 --> 29:18.600
I need to go for a poo.
(laughs)

29:24.067 --> 29:28.267
Are you not going on any?
I want to, but my hair's a
nightmare.

29:28.333 --> 29:31.400
Wait, cos I really want to
watch this, please.

29:31.467 --> 29:32.933
Faith and Abbie.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
(screaming)

29:37.033 --> 29:40.300
Faith's proper game, you know.
She likes rides.

29:42.067 --> 29:43.733
What's going on with you?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.600
I think I am really enjoying
being single.

29:46.667 --> 29:49.900
Like, I've had so much fun
in the past few months

29:49.967 --> 29:52.700
going on holidays with the girls
and you,

29:52.767 --> 29:55.933
and getting away
and coming to places like this.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.567
Even though I've had fun
with the girls,

29:58.633 --> 30:01.467
it's been shit arguing with
my mate's fella.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.900
I wouldn't mind being with a
hunk
for a bit of fun.

30:04.967 --> 30:07.567
I mean, I know I had Alex
in Australia.

30:07.633 --> 30:08.767
That was amazing.

30:08.833 --> 30:12.133
I did have him there and he's
lovely,
but...

30:12.200 --> 30:15.167
Alex was a holiday romance
that Sophie needed.

30:15.233 --> 30:18.467
She needs some more fun times
with some fit guys.

30:18.533 --> 30:21.000
At first, we thought
he was annoying.

30:21.067 --> 30:25.200
Then the attraction came
afterwards.
He was a bit of fun.

30:30.267 --> 30:32.333
I've never really liked water.

30:32.400 --> 30:35.867
I'm a really big water baby.
I'm always in the water.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.567
I think I was a mermaid
in a past life.

30:38.633 --> 30:41.633
I got my one metre badge.
Yeah, that's good.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.633
It's nice having some bonding
time
with Chloe.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.633
It's great that we're getting
along
so well.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.700
Just do it.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.200
No. No -
More -

30:52.267 --> 30:54.833
Me and Faith haven't seen
eye to eye,

30:54.900 --> 30:57.833
but we're getting on
and she's settling in.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.333
This is the one you might like,
but it's underwater.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.933
You just splash around.

31:10.233 --> 31:13.033
I can't believe how well
today's gone.

31:13.100 --> 31:16.333
Especially cos of the drama
that's been going on.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.233
Now everyone seems a family.

31:18.300 --> 31:23.067
Considering where we were
yesterday.
I'm glad we've broken the
divide.

31:23.133 --> 31:27.567
I'll tell you who I would've
loved
to have been here in her bikini.

31:27.633 --> 31:28.633
Your nana!

31:28.700 --> 31:31.700
Why don't we -
We should get her out tonight.

31:31.767 --> 31:34.867
Oh, yeah. Last night in Beni.
We'll get Nana out

31:34.933 --> 31:37.500
and she'll drink yous
under the table.

31:37.567 --> 31:39.900
As long as she brings that
scooter.

31:39.967 --> 31:42.667
I can't wait to see Abbie's nana
again.

31:42.733 --> 31:44.767
She's more radge than all of us.

31:44.833 --> 31:47.367
Come on then.
Let's get home.

31:47.433 --> 31:48.500
Let's get ready.

31:48.567 --> 31:49.900
Today has been mint,

31:49.967 --> 31:52.867
but it's time to get back to
the house.

31:57.100 --> 32:00.500
I am buzzing for the last night
in Benidorm.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.133
It's our last night
and I'm thinking about home.

32:12.200 --> 32:17.133
I'm gonna give Holly a cheeky
call
and see where the hell she is.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.833
(dialling tone)

32:20.900 --> 32:23.667
Hello. Is that my Holly dolly?

32:26.300 --> 32:28.267
How are you, my darling?

32:28.333 --> 32:30.667
It's amazing to hear Holly's
voice.

32:30.733 --> 32:34.867
I can't wait to catch up with
her
and fill her in on the gossip.

32:34.933 --> 32:37.700
I just need me girl back,
to be honest.

32:37.767 --> 32:41.700
There is so much to catch up on.
I don't know where to start.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.900
I can't wait to see you.

32:46.967 --> 32:48.500
I will. Love you.

32:48.567 --> 32:53.200
After everything that's gone on,
having my Holly back in the
house

32:53.267 --> 32:54.800
will be amazing.

32:58.500 --> 33:02.867
I rang Holly earlier and I was
like,
"Where the hell are you?"

33:02.933 --> 33:06.100
She said she'd extend her
holiday
and come soon.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.867
Lucky her! We're working!

33:07.933 --> 33:09.567
All this talk about Holly

33:09.633 --> 33:12.267
is making us miss home
and my rat babies.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.033
I hope Uncle Scott
has looked after them.

33:15.100 --> 33:17.100
What is Holly like?

33:17.167 --> 33:21.533
She's very intelligent.
She knows how to spell
everything.

33:24.367 --> 33:27.200
Howay, you bunch of
beaver-wearing
beavers.

33:27.267 --> 33:29.500
I'm so happy everyone is
friends.

33:29.567 --> 33:32.900
Tonight we can enjoy our night.
(doorbell)

33:35.200 --> 33:36.533
Wahey!

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
Let's get this party started!

33:38.667 --> 33:41.233
Let's get this party started!

33:41.300 --> 33:42.300
Hiya!

33:42.367 --> 33:46.700
Nana's here to get the party
started. Tonight is gonna be
wicked.

33:46.767 --> 33:50.300
I can't wait to get out
and shake a nifty clog.

33:50.367 --> 33:52.467
I'll drink to that.
Nana!

33:52.533 --> 33:56.100
What better way to end our stay
in Benners

33:56.167 --> 33:59.700
than to go out with
the radgiest pensioner ever.

33:59.767 --> 34:02.600
Are you pissed?
No, I've been really good.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.400
Maybe a daiquiri or two
to get warmed up.

34:07.033 --> 34:09.833
I feel like we should go, yous.
(cheering)

34:09.900 --> 34:13.433
# We like to drink with
Christine
Christine is our mate

34:13.500 --> 34:17.300
# When we drink with Christine
She drinks it down in eight

34:17.367 --> 34:20.667
# Seven, six, five, four
Three, two, one #

34:20.733 --> 34:21.733
(cheering)

34:25.100 --> 34:27.933
Enough sitting around.
Let's hit the strip.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Beni isn't gonna drink itself.

34:33.900 --> 34:37.867
Abbie's nan's here.
She's a bad influence.

34:38.933 --> 34:41.533
I've necked on with a worldie.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.433
To the family!
To the family!

34:48.500 --> 34:50.433
Geordie Shore. Why aye!

34:52.933 --> 34:53.132
.

34:55.667 --> 34:55.867
.

35:06.900 --> 35:11.167
It's our final night in Beni
and Nana is already pissed.

35:11.233 --> 35:14.133
I'm definitely gonna have to
babysit
tonight.

35:19.633 --> 35:23.100
I love Benidorm, me.
This club is fucking unreal.

35:40.767 --> 35:43.567
Abbie's nan's here
and that means one thing.

35:43.633 --> 35:46.467
Everyone's mortal.
She's a bad influence.

36:26.433 --> 36:28.633
Ooh, Nana! You little minx!

36:47.100 --> 36:50.400
Benidorm has had its fair share
of drama.

36:50.467 --> 36:53.067
Me hitting Sam
and Nathan with Chloe.

36:53.133 --> 36:56.600
But us girls have managed to
keep
our shit together.

37:06.333 --> 37:10.467
I feel like one of the girls
and that I'm finally fitting in.

37:10.533 --> 37:13.367
There is one thing missing.
A lad to pull.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.800
Operation wing woman.

37:27.867 --> 37:30.133
Let's find Faith some cock.

37:32.467 --> 37:35.533
I can't believe that chat-up
line
worked!

37:43.400 --> 37:46.633
He is fit, but before this can
go
any further,

37:46.700 --> 37:49.967
he needs to pass
my compatibility questionnaire.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.667
This isn't a great start.

38:03.333 --> 38:06.833
Fucking hell. This is painful.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.933
She needs help.

38:14.967 --> 38:15.967
(cheering)

38:21.733 --> 38:24.833
It just goes to show you only
need
one question.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.300
I'm having an amazing night.

38:31.367 --> 38:35.600
I've necked on with a worldie
and this blondie's not bad
either.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.800
Nana is doing an all-nighter.

38:46.867 --> 38:50.033
She is going to the airport
from the club.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.433
She is the radgiest of the
radge.

38:56.633 --> 38:59.567
I can't believe these kids
are making me go.

38:59.633 --> 39:03.800
Nana has just got started.
Never mind. Next stop, duty
free.

39:12.833 --> 39:15.367
I've been thinking about this
all day.

39:15.433 --> 39:19.333
It's time I told Chloe the
reason
I got upset with her

39:19.400 --> 39:21.467
and try to get us back on track.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.433
Nathan's right.
We have drifted apart.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.267
It's not my fault.
We need to make time.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.933
It's upset us that I hurt
Nathan.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.733
It's hard trying to please
my best friend and boyfriend.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.200
It's gonna take time.

40:31.133 --> 40:32.867
Tonight has been mint.

40:32.933 --> 40:36.600
But come on, you radgies.
Let's get back to the villa.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.033
Thank you.

40:46.100 --> 40:49.000
I am fucking mortal.
Benidorm has ruined me.

40:49.067 --> 40:51.433
You've absolutely done me in.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.867
Tonight has been such a good
fucking good night.

40:54.933 --> 40:58.233
How are we gonna get on
the aeroplane this morning?

40:58.300 --> 40:59.300
Keep drinking!

40:59.367 --> 41:02.200
Look at the orchid.
Here's some food.

41:02.267 --> 41:04.233
So, you know how Faith pulled?

41:04.300 --> 41:07.300
When she pulls people,
she asks them questions.

41:07.367 --> 41:09.067
That's why he walked away.

41:09.133 --> 41:12.400
Excuse me, Sophie.
He didn't walk away, actually.

41:12.467 --> 41:16.200
He kept his sauce in the fridge.
It was never gonna work.

41:16.267 --> 41:20.633
Where do you keep your tomato
sauce?
In the fucking fridge. Cupboard.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.967
In the fucking cupboard.

41:23.033 --> 41:26.800
Imagine hot chips on a hot day.

41:26.867 --> 41:29.100
Ooh. What's nicer than dipping
them

41:29.167 --> 41:33.133
in a cool-ass dip of tomato
sauce?

41:33.200 --> 41:37.033
Do you know what's nicer than -
And then this sacrilege.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.633
If you want your food cooled
down,

41:40.700 --> 41:45.367
the sauce you pick is mayonnaise
that's kept in the fridge.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.700
Ooooooh.

41:51.067 --> 41:54.433
Fridge. Cupboard. Cupboard.
Fridge.
What the fuck?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.533
Order! Order!
You savage!

41:56.600 --> 41:58.633
Mayonnaise is egg,

41:58.700 --> 42:02.167
so it's gotta be in the fridge
or you get salmonella.

42:02.233 --> 42:04.800
Where the fuck do you put
your tomatoes?

42:04.867 --> 42:08.400
If you don't put them in the
fridge,
they'll go off.

42:08.467 --> 42:11.467
I don't buy my tomatoes to go
off
in one day.

42:11.533 --> 42:13.833
In one day!

42:13.900 --> 42:17.167
Tomato sauce! Tomato sauce!

42:17.233 --> 42:20.400
Tomato sauce! Tomato sauce!

42:20.467 --> 42:23.100
What the fuck, Sophie?
Sauce all over.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.600
And that sauce, bitch,

42:24.667 --> 42:28.000
has been put straight in
the motherfucking fridge.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.467
You're a fucking cunt.

42:29.533 --> 42:31.467
Let's agree to disagree.

42:31.533 --> 42:35.067
But we can definitely agree
Benidorm's been amazing.

42:37.500 --> 42:41.733
Benidorm has actually been
one trip

42:41.800 --> 42:44.133
that we all started off as
friends.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.133
We've had a massive blow out.

42:46.200 --> 42:50.467
Sam got chinned by Sophie,
me and Chloe had a massive fall
out.

42:50.533 --> 42:53.567
But we're still a family,
all together, right?

42:54.633 --> 42:58.633
The family is in a good place
and life couldn't get any
better.

42:59.833 --> 43:02.367
To the family!
To the family!

43:02.433 --> 43:04.267
Howay!

43:05.600 --> 43:09.233
Goodbye, Benidorm.
Hello, the Toon.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.467
(cheering)

43:11.533 --> 43:12.867
Hello, yous.

43:12.933 --> 43:14.667
Holly is finally back.

43:14.733 --> 43:18.100
We are doing Newcastle Pride.
(cheering)

43:21.033 --> 43:23.133
Aussie Aussie Aussie!

43:23.200 --> 43:24.900
It's Alex from Australia.

43:24.967 --> 43:27.767
My heart is absolutely racing.

43:27.833 --> 43:29.767
We've got unfinished business.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.733
Calm down. Sophie is right
there.

43:35.333 --> 43:38.267
Is he fuck hurting me.
Go back to Australia.

43:38.333 --> 43:41.200
His hair's shit.
He needs to learn a lesson.

43:41.267 --> 43:42.367
(cries)

43:42.433 --> 43:44.267
He's hurting Sophie.

43:49.367 --> 43:51.067
# Everyone's here to party

43:51.133 --> 43:52.933
# If you wanna go hard

43:53.000 --> 43:54.733
# Everyone's here to party

43:54.800 --> 43:56.733
# If you wanna go hard

43:56.800 --> 43:58.533
# Everyone's here to party

43:58.600 --> 44:00.333
# If you wanna go hard

44:00.400 --> 44:02.133
# Everyone's here to party

44:02.200 --> 44:03.833
# Let's party, party

44:03.900 --> 44:05.767
# Let's party, party

44:05.833 --> 44:07.600
# Oi oi
Wanna go hard?

44:07.667 --> 44:09.000
# Let's party hard #

44:14.867 --> 44:15.067
.
