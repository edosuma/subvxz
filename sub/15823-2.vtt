00:02.036 --> 00:05.670
And you've been
with the LAPD now for...

00:05.704 --> 00:06.970
A little over five years.

00:07.004 --> 00:07.971
Really?

00:08.004 --> 00:10.804
Hmm.
It seems longer.

00:10.839 --> 00:13.472
Before that, you were
with the Atlanta PD,

00:13.506 --> 00:15.639
and before that,
the Washington DC Police Force...

00:15.674 --> 00:17.673
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

00:17.708 --> 00:20.341
You know, Captain Raydor,
I could probably be much more helpful

00:20.375 --> 00:23.876
with your Internal Affairs investigation

00:23.910 --> 00:25.209
if I knew what it was about.

00:25.244 --> 00:28.545
You'd be surprised
how many people think that.

00:28.579 --> 00:31.146
But the best way
to help me, really,

00:31.180 --> 00:33.647
is to answer my questions
as thoroughly as possible.

00:33.682 --> 00:37.082
Now, you first met Chief Pope

00:37.116 --> 00:38.216
in Washington DC ...

00:38.250 --> 00:39.283
Is that correct?

00:39.317 --> 00:40.517
Yes, it is.

00:40.551 --> 00:42.051
Is he the subject of this...

00:42.085 --> 00:44.720
Can you tell me how and when
the two of you first met?

00:44.754 --> 00:47.888
In March of 1997,
I became liaison officer

00:47.922 --> 00:51.023
From the...
Department of State

00:51.057 --> 00:52.958
to the DC Police Department,

00:52.991 --> 00:55.125
where Chief Pope was Deputy Chief.

00:55.159 --> 00:57.193
And how was your working
relationship with Chief Pope?

00:57.227 --> 00:58.828
Excellent...
in fact, we got along so well

00:58.862 --> 01:02.029
that, um, he convinced me
to leave my job

01:02.063 --> 01:04.497
and join the DC Police Department.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.332
Gave me an excellent opportunity

01:06.367 --> 01:08.568
to observe his leadership skills
close up.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.669
Because the two of you
were having an affair?

01:13.170 --> 01:16.805
When you work the hours we do,
under pressured situations,

01:16.839 --> 01:19.074
it's not unusual to find
yourself involved with a co-worker.

01:19.108 --> 01:20.241
Even a married one?

01:20.276 --> 01:21.342
He didn't tell me he was married

01:21.376 --> 01:22.676
when we first started seeing
each other.

01:24.578 --> 01:26.246
Of course, that does not make him

01:26.280 --> 01:29.014
a bad candidate for Chief of Police.

01:29.049 --> 01:32.417
You know how much longer
she'll be in there?

01:32.451 --> 01:34.686
No. Don't touch the paint, please.

01:34.721 --> 01:36.722
I can tell you,
if it's up to the Chief,

01:36.756 --> 01:38.423
She's not gonna be
in there long.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.524
It's not a social call.

01:39.559 --> 01:41.726
Captain Raydor's conducting

01:41.761 --> 01:43.895
some sort of investigation
for Internal Affairs.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.964
Oh, oh, oh,
it's not an investigation.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.532
It's a background check
on Pope.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.400
He wants to be
the next Chief of Police.

01:49.435 --> 01:53.104
IA's talking to everyone of
rank who works directly for him.

01:53.139 --> 01:54.305
Ah.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.741
Um, I'm sure I'll be next.

01:56.776 --> 01:59.110
Yeah.

01:59.145 --> 02:01.046
Do you have your own office yet?

02:04.617 --> 02:05.917
No.

02:08.652 --> 02:11.620
Captain Raydor, I'm finding
these questions extremely personal.

02:13.990 --> 02:15.957
I assure you,
if it were personal,

02:15.991 --> 02:17.625
I would not be here now.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.293
The intimate part of my
relationship with Chief Pope

02:20.328 --> 02:21.461
ended in DC

02:21.495 --> 02:22.995
and is a matter of record

02:23.030 --> 02:26.299
disclosed by Chief Pope himself
before I was even hired.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.967
But if Chief Pope
created Major Crimes

02:29.001 --> 02:30.935
specifically to bring you
to Los Angeles...

02:30.969 --> 02:32.937
No, Major Crimes was just
another name for a division

02:32.971 --> 02:36.539
that had been in operation for
an entire year before I even arrived.

02:36.574 --> 02:39.208
It was, um, not created
specifically for me.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.377
It was designed to prevent
the Department

02:41.411 --> 02:43.879
from suffering through
another crisis like it had

02:43.913 --> 02:45.914
with the O.J.
and Rampart investigations.

02:45.949 --> 02:47.315
And, to Chief Pope's credit,

02:47.350 --> 02:49.417
the division is performing
exactly as designed,

02:49.451 --> 02:51.485
as you can see for yourself.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.221
<i>Oh, thank you.
I would love to see for myself.</i>

02:54.255 --> 02:56.955
You know, prior to this,

02:56.990 --> 02:59.057
you and I have pursued
parallel investigations.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.259
But for me to really get
a good look

03:01.293 --> 03:03.394
at how Major Crimes operates,

03:03.428 --> 03:06.463
I do need to accompany you
on your next investigation.

03:06.497 --> 03:08.497
Fantastic.

03:11.935 --> 03:14.137
What did you say?

03:14.171 --> 03:15.638
Well, what was I supposed
to say, Will?

03:15.673 --> 03:18.475
She's from Internal Affairs.
I had to say yes, didn't I?

03:18.510 --> 03:20.611
Of course, yeah.

03:20.645 --> 03:22.713
No, no, no, yeah,
you... you did the right thing.

03:22.747 --> 03:24.580
And we have to think
that Internal Affairs

03:24.615 --> 03:27.082
interviewing my subordinates so
early in the selection process

03:27.117 --> 03:28.317
is good for me.

03:28.351 --> 03:30.784
Well, Captain Raydor
poking around my division

03:30.819 --> 03:32.351
with her little rule book
isn't good for me.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.285
As it happens, I've just been
handed the perfect opportunity

03:35.319 --> 03:37.787
for her to tag along without
causing too much trouble...

03:37.821 --> 03:40.023
Special request from the Mayor.

03:40.057 --> 03:42.290
What about?

03:42.325 --> 03:44.192
His friends
Melissa and Gregory Disken

03:44.226 --> 03:46.994
have reported
their nanny missing.

03:47.029 --> 03:48.863
They're hoping I'll babysit?

03:48.897 --> 03:51.297
Did you not hear the word
"Mayor" in all that?

03:51.332 --> 03:54.600
Look, this special request
gives me an opportunity

03:54.634 --> 03:56.001
for daily updates with the man

03:56.035 --> 03:58.103
who will ultimately pick
the next Chief of Police,

03:58.138 --> 04:01.706
so quit complaining and see this
as a-a huge opportunity.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.041
For you.

04:03.075 --> 04:04.308
For us.

04:04.343 --> 04:06.377
The city is out of money.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.779
The entire Department is working
one week on, one week off.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.547
They've already split up
Metro Division.

04:10.581 --> 04:12.148
The only thing stopping
Major Crimes

04:12.182 --> 04:14.484
from being chopped up and sold
for parts right now is me.

04:14.518 --> 04:17.219
So find the nanny,
impress Captain Raydor,

04:17.253 --> 04:20.555
let's have something good
to tell the mayor.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.524
So, this nanny,
this Adriana Gomez...

04:23.559 --> 04:25.693
How long has she been missing?

04:25.727 --> 04:28.295
- It's almost 36 hours.
- Oh, Will.

04:28.330 --> 04:31.432
That isn't even long enough to
file a missing-persons report.

04:31.466 --> 04:33.400
Feel free to lodge a complaint
with my office

04:33.435 --> 04:35.202
after I'm sworn in
for a five-year term.

04:35.236 --> 04:38.239
How am I supposed to explain
this investigation to Captain Raydor?

04:38.273 --> 04:40.007
What's she gonna ask you?

04:40.041 --> 04:43.644
Now, how exactly does
tracking down someone's nanny

04:43.678 --> 04:45.679
qualify as a Major Crime?

04:45.713 --> 04:49.015
I ask as a purely neutral observer.

04:49.049 --> 04:52.518
Chief Pope feels this may end up
being a critical missing,

04:52.553 --> 04:55.321
and I'm going to treat it
that way.

04:55.355 --> 04:57.656
What are you writing down?

05:00.892 --> 05:03.258
Dad, it's the cops.

05:03.293 --> 05:05.192
Please come in.

05:05.226 --> 05:07.660
You can have a seat in here.

05:07.694 --> 05:10.663
Uh, you'll have to
excuse the mess.

05:10.697 --> 05:13.933
Things have sort of fallen apart
since Adriana left.

05:13.967 --> 05:17.936
Four kids and only one nanny.

05:17.970 --> 05:21.239
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That sounds horrible.

05:21.273 --> 05:23.941
Look, Melissa and I both work,
so without Adriana,

05:23.975 --> 05:26.609
we're playing catch-up
on all the kids' activities,

05:26.644 --> 05:28.578
especially since they're
out of school for the summer.

05:28.612 --> 05:31.213
Avery, why don't you
take Violet into the media room

05:31.248 --> 05:33.181
and put on a movie
for your sisters?

05:33.215 --> 05:34.948
But, Dad, I want to help find Adriana.

05:34.983 --> 05:37.584
Avery, do what I tell you
to do, okay?

05:43.923 --> 05:46.657
Please, sit down.

05:46.691 --> 05:51.727
So, um, I take it y'all still
haven't heard from Adriana?

05:51.761 --> 05:54.028
I tried her home number and then
her cell, and there was no answer.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.930
She didn't show up for work
yesterday or today.

05:56.964 --> 05:59.098
It's really not like her at all.

05:59.132 --> 06:00.699
Listen, Chief Johnson.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.467
I'm sure Adriana's fine.
I think we're just overreacting.

06:03.502 --> 06:06.437
It's my fault. Greg didn't know
that I had called the Mayor.

06:06.471 --> 06:08.438
I'm sorry.

06:08.473 --> 06:12.642
Um, are you saying that
you requested LAPD help

06:12.676 --> 06:13.977
from the Mayor?

06:14.011 --> 06:16.980
Uh, your anxiety is... is
understandable, Mrs. Disken.

06:17.014 --> 06:18.948
It's always good to use caution
in these situations,

06:18.983 --> 06:20.083
but you're right.

06:20.117 --> 06:22.052
There probably is
a logical explanation

06:22.086 --> 06:23.386
for your nanny's disappearance.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.487
Oh, yes, I wouldn't worry.

06:24.521 --> 06:25.989
When an adult hasn't been heard from

06:26.023 --> 06:27.490
for a day and a half,

06:27.524 --> 06:29.492
it's usually not
a critical missing.

06:29.526 --> 06:33.630
But we're here,
so better to be safe than sorry.

06:33.665 --> 06:36.600
Tell me, Mr. And Mrs. Disken,
does Adriana speak English?

06:36.634 --> 06:39.636
Excuse... excuse me, Chief.

06:39.670 --> 06:41.338
You know the LAPD

06:41.372 --> 06:43.640
is not allowed to ask a person's
immigration status.

06:43.674 --> 06:45.842
I didn't.
I asked if she speaks English.

06:45.876 --> 06:47.243
She does, perfectly.

06:47.278 --> 06:49.980
And she's a citizen,
so that's not an issue.

06:50.014 --> 06:52.916
And we pay all
her social security taxes.

06:52.951 --> 06:55.119
The Mayor's a friend, and I'm
not going to embarrass him.

06:55.154 --> 06:56.888
All right, then, Mr. Disken.

06:56.922 --> 06:59.157
And how long have y'all
known Adriana?

06:59.192 --> 07:02.593
She started working for us
right after Avery was born.

07:02.628 --> 07:03.828
He's 11.

07:03.862 --> 07:06.431
And does Adriana have
any family around here,

07:06.465 --> 07:08.366
or is she married
or have a boyfriend?

07:08.401 --> 07:11.636
I think she's seeing someone.

07:11.670 --> 07:15.439
Um, his name is David
or, uh, Diego?

07:15.473 --> 07:18.175
It's Daniel, Mom,
and they broke up last year.

07:18.209 --> 07:21.212
- Avery, what did I tell you?
- Adriana's in trouble, Dad.

07:21.246 --> 07:23.548
- We don't know her life, son.
- I do.

07:23.582 --> 07:26.051
The last time we were with her,
everything was fine.

07:26.086 --> 07:29.223
Adriana wouldn't
just not come back.

07:29.257 --> 07:30.558
S-she wouldn't.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.032
Excuse me.
Hello?

07:35.067 --> 07:38.869
Sweetie, do you want
to come talk to the police?

07:38.903 --> 07:41.206
Avery's been very upset
since Adriana left.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.409
And how lucky she is
that you're here to help us.

07:43.444 --> 07:45.211
Tell me, Avery,

07:45.246 --> 07:48.416
the last time you
and your sisters saw Adriana,

07:48.450 --> 07:50.718
did you notice anything unusual?

07:50.752 --> 07:52.053
No.

07:52.087 --> 07:53.788
We were together all day,

07:53.822 --> 07:55.356
and she only talked to us

07:55.391 --> 07:56.925
and my friends
Griffin and Ruben

07:56.959 --> 08:01.128
and a couple other nannies
at the park, but that was it.

08:01.163 --> 08:03.864
Mrs. Disken, do you know
where Adriana lives?

08:06.301 --> 08:08.936
Uh, God, I don't.

08:08.970 --> 08:11.939
I'm sorry. I... wow.

08:11.973 --> 08:13.941
She's been with us
almost 12 years,

08:13.975 --> 08:16.210
and I don't know
where she lives, huh?

08:16.244 --> 08:19.547
But Greg has driven her home
a few times.

08:20.716 --> 08:23.852
Only when she stayed late and
didn't want to take the bus.

08:27.189 --> 08:28.623
I-I suppose I could show you
where it is.

08:28.657 --> 08:31.258
Why don't you just give us
the address?

08:37.496 --> 08:38.897
Chief.

08:38.931 --> 08:41.899
Adriana Gomez,
born in Mexico city,

08:41.933 --> 08:43.967
Got her green card in '96,

08:44.001 --> 08:45.534
became a naturalized citizen
three years ago.

08:45.569 --> 08:47.233
Well, Gregory Disken
wasn't lying about that.

08:47.268 --> 08:48.967
He wouldn't want to embarrass
the Mayor,

08:49.001 --> 08:50.367
who I imagine is the reason

08:50.402 --> 08:53.034
Chief Pope designated
this missing nanny

08:53.069 --> 08:54.702
as a Major Crime to begin with.

08:54.736 --> 08:57.037
Thank you so much for your
neutral assessment, Captain.

08:57.071 --> 08:58.972
Go on, Lieutenant.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.407
This is Adriana's
only known address.

09:00.441 --> 09:01.808
Though she's not answering
the door.

09:01.843 --> 09:03.477
Chief, landlord lives
in Malibu.

09:03.511 --> 09:06.414
He can meet us here,
but it's gonna take a while.

09:06.448 --> 09:07.948
No sense in loitering.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.721
Chief.

09:14.756 --> 09:16.957
Yes, Captain, what is it?

09:16.991 --> 09:19.560
Are you gonna enter
a private residence

09:19.594 --> 09:20.795
without a search warrant?

09:20.829 --> 09:22.931
No. I'm doing
a public-safety check.

09:22.965 --> 09:24.366
Public-safety check?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.902
Whether or not you agree, this
is still a critical missing,

09:26.936 --> 09:31.006
and it is my duty
to enter the premises

09:31.040 --> 09:36.278
if I suspect that a member
of the public is not safe.

09:36.312 --> 09:38.614
Detective Sanchez.

09:42.519 --> 09:43.652
Yoo-hoo!

09:43.687 --> 09:46.456
Adriana!

09:46.490 --> 09:47.924
Adriana!

09:48.960 --> 09:51.061
Hola! Policía!

09:53.899 --> 09:56.267
Chief!

09:57.135 --> 10:01.369
Oh, my God.
Oh.

10:01.403 --> 10:03.537
Ugh.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:17.012 --> 10:19.679
I ran a master search
on Adriana Gomez...

10:19.713 --> 10:23.148
No criminal record, no warrants,
not even a ticket.

10:23.183 --> 10:26.618
And Adriana's landlord faxed
over her rental agreement.

10:26.652 --> 10:28.154
She didn't list any family.

10:28.188 --> 10:31.928
Detective Sanchez, any other murders
like this one in the area?

10:31.962 --> 10:34.496
Hardly any crimes at all.
This isn't gangland, Chief.

10:34.531 --> 10:36.432
These are real tight-knit,
hard-working people.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.134
Well, if it was a home invasion,

10:38.168 --> 10:39.735
Adriana must have let
her attacker in,

10:39.769 --> 10:41.603
'cause there was no sign
of forced entry.

10:41.637 --> 10:43.271
Maybe not into her apartment,

10:43.306 --> 10:46.507
but there was definitely
forced entry here.

10:46.542 --> 10:49.609
- She was raped?
- Brutally.

10:49.644 --> 10:52.278
The tearing and bruising are...

10:53.681 --> 10:54.848
Pardon me.

10:54.882 --> 10:58.519
It's just...Some things here
you never get used to.

10:58.553 --> 11:00.654
If you come around the table...

11:08.930 --> 11:12.833
Look here, here, and here.

11:12.867 --> 11:15.636
These cutaneous lesions...
electrical burns.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.704
- He used a stun gun.
- Yeah, he did.

11:17.739 --> 11:20.307
She'd have been
totally incapacitated.

11:20.341 --> 11:21.842
- Oh, God.
- Cause of death?

11:21.876 --> 11:24.111
Extensive cranial hemorrhaging.

11:24.145 --> 11:27.146
After he raped her,
he beat her to death.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.048
Wait, wait.

11:29.082 --> 11:33.319
So, this guy immobilized her,
sexually assaulted her,

11:33.354 --> 11:35.791
and then let her get dressed
before killing her?

11:35.826 --> 11:38.695
Something must have set him off
after he raped her.

11:38.729 --> 11:40.397
There's a lot of rage here.

11:40.431 --> 11:41.665
The only decent news...

11:41.700 --> 11:43.167
He left a good DNA sample
for the rape Kit.

11:43.201 --> 11:46.905
Maybe you could find a match
to other sexual assaults.

11:46.939 --> 11:49.241
Thank you.
Let's notify the family.

11:54.048 --> 11:56.249
What family?

11:56.283 --> 12:00.788
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12:00.822 --> 12:03.190
What are we gonna tell the kids?

12:03.224 --> 12:05.292
Do you have any idea
who did this?

12:05.327 --> 12:07.261
The investigation
is ongoing, sir.

12:07.295 --> 12:09.262
But we could really use
your help.

12:09.297 --> 12:11.297
What...
what else can we do?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.765
Well, most rape victims...
they know their assailants,

12:13.800 --> 12:15.702
so if there was anyone
in Adriana's life...

12:15.736 --> 12:19.673
I really think we're the wrong
people to be asking. I...

12:19.707 --> 12:22.510
If we could learn more
about Adriana...

12:22.544 --> 12:24.278
In particular,
how she spent her last day...

12:24.312 --> 12:25.646
That might give us some clues.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.680
Oh, God.

12:30.385 --> 12:33.387
I just feel
like I should have known.

12:33.422 --> 12:36.892
You know, I should have known
if she was having problems.

12:36.926 --> 12:39.227
I should have spoken
to her more.

12:39.262 --> 12:40.695
Well, speak for her now.

12:44.701 --> 12:47.570
Tuesday morning, I...

12:47.604 --> 12:51.140
I assume that she took the bus,
like she always did.

12:51.174 --> 12:54.342
You know, it lets her out
at the bottom of our street.

12:55.744 --> 12:58.012
The Diskens are friends
of the Mayor.

12:58.047 --> 13:01.381
Tell me she's not treating them
like suspects.

13:01.416 --> 13:05.886
Well, they're not in an
interview room, now, are they?

13:05.920 --> 13:09.655
Does Chief Pope know about this?

13:11.959 --> 13:15.330
Adriana was wonderful.
She was.

13:15.364 --> 13:16.998
I mean, she would get
the kids home

13:17.032 --> 13:19.000
And get them bathed
and into their jammies,

13:19.035 --> 13:21.236
usually by 6:00.

13:21.270 --> 13:25.674
I mean, I'm always home
for dinner and bedtime, always.

13:25.708 --> 13:29.444
So I guess that she left
around 7:00.

13:29.478 --> 13:32.680
And what time did you get home
from work, Mr. Disken?

13:32.715 --> 13:36.017
Uh, I don't remember exactly.

13:36.051 --> 13:39.187
I was driving home,
got stuck in traffic,

13:39.221 --> 13:43.925
So probably 8:30, 9:00,
give or take.

13:43.960 --> 13:44.960
That's all for now.

13:44.994 --> 13:46.662
Thank y'all so much
for coming in.

13:49.899 --> 13:51.634
And I'm... I'm...

13:51.668 --> 13:53.569
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:55.672 --> 13:56.939
Oh.

13:59.009 --> 14:01.511
Come on, Mel.
I'll take you home.

14:13.192 --> 14:14.426
Oh, excuse me, Captain.

14:17.163 --> 14:19.365
Lieutenant Provenza,
tomorrow morning,

14:19.399 --> 14:21.701
I'd like the squad
to retrace every step

14:21.735 --> 14:23.002
of Adriana's last day.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.770
Confirm the facts.

14:24.805 --> 14:26.806
See if you can find someone
who knew her

14:26.840 --> 14:28.841
or anyone who might have seen
something that might help us.

14:28.876 --> 14:31.511
Thank you.

14:31.545 --> 14:32.679
Um, Chief.

14:33.848 --> 14:35.749
Correct me if I'm wrong.

14:35.783 --> 14:39.253
Gregory Disken clearly didn't want
his wife calling in any favors,

14:39.287 --> 14:41.088
his alibi is weak,
and he didn't want to be here.

14:41.122 --> 14:44.725
So, while your squad
is out looking for leads,

14:44.759 --> 14:48.362
your main suspect just walked
through the door.

14:48.396 --> 14:51.465
Lieutenant Tao,
he was sitting on the left.

14:53.068 --> 14:56.304
I'm gonna cut a hole in the
bottom of this water bottle,

14:56.338 --> 14:59.006
Drain the water
as to not contaminate the top...

15:05.213 --> 15:06.912
Like so...

15:09.983 --> 15:13.252
Air this out, and we'll have a perfect
DNA sample of Mr. Disken.

15:13.286 --> 15:15.553
Thank you so much, Lieutenant.

15:21.694 --> 15:23.394
Mm.

15:23.429 --> 15:25.129
Yes, Captain. "mm."

15:25.164 --> 15:28.299
Look, we all know what this
investigation of yours is about.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.969
I would just like to know
how questioning my methods
relates to Chief Pope.

15:32.003 --> 15:33.636
You will eventually.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.905
I'd very much like
to accompany your division

15:35.940 --> 15:38.341
on their field trip tomorrow,
if you have no objections.

15:46.981 --> 15:49.115
Hola, Adriana.

16:33.270 --> 16:36.369
If I remember correctly, the Diskens
live about a half a mile up that hill.

16:36.403 --> 16:40.337
And if Adriana was on time the
way the Diskens said she was,

16:40.371 --> 16:41.871
these would be her bus mates.

16:41.906 --> 16:44.740
It's kind of a long walk
for some of these women.

16:48.009 --> 16:50.409
¡Señoras, por favor!

16:51.417 --> 16:53.623
¿Ustedes conocieron
a esta muchacha?

16:54.162 --> 16:56.041
Ella trabajó por aquí,
cuidando niños.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.014
Do you know her, Señora?

17:47.048 --> 17:48.148
¿la conoces?

17:48.182 --> 17:50.716
Adriana Gomez...
do you know her?

17:50.750 --> 17:53.651
Señora, do you know her...
Adriana Gomez?

17:53.686 --> 17:55.752
Hey, Señora, por favor.

17:55.787 --> 17:58.454
Do you know her...
Adriana Gomez?

17:58.488 --> 18:01.489
Sí, la conozco...
Adriana.

18:01.523 --> 18:04.391
I ride home with her a lot.

18:04.425 --> 18:06.792
Was she on the bus with you
Tuesday night, three days ago?

18:06.827 --> 18:09.194
No. No.

18:09.229 --> 18:11.630
I have not seen her
since Monday.

18:11.664 --> 18:13.865
But sometimes she gets a ride,

18:13.900 --> 18:16.167
as her boss is nicer than mine.

18:16.202 --> 18:18.402
Gracias, Señora.

18:18.437 --> 18:20.471
Sí, bueno.

18:22.707 --> 18:25.075
So, that's what makes
Gregory Disken a suspect...

18:25.110 --> 18:28.278
He sometimes offers
his housekeeper a ride home?

18:28.313 --> 18:30.313
How did you even find out
about this?

18:34.017 --> 18:36.318
Commander, you really need
to get your own office.

18:36.353 --> 18:37.419
I couldn't agree more, Chief.

18:37.454 --> 18:40.956
So, aside from his basic
human kindness,

18:40.990 --> 18:43.091
what else connects Disken
to this murder?

18:43.126 --> 18:44.192
It's too early to say.

18:44.227 --> 18:45.527
Once we establish his alibi

18:45.561 --> 18:47.529
and whether not
he owns a stun gun...

18:47.563 --> 18:48.864
Oh, God,
tell me you're kidding.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.032
Oh, God, what am I supposed
to say when I update the Mayor?

18:51.066 --> 18:53.501
That we can completely eliminate
his friend as a suspect

18:53.535 --> 18:56.036
once we get the results
back from his DNA sample.

18:56.071 --> 18:57.438
You took his DNA?

18:57.472 --> 18:58.872
Without his knowledge.

18:58.907 --> 19:02.142
If it doesn't match, he's in
the clear and none the wiser.

19:03.512 --> 19:05.647
Remember when this was supposed
to be an opportunity for me?

19:08.184 --> 19:09.651
Come in.

19:09.685 --> 19:11.819
Thank you.

19:11.854 --> 19:13.788
Yes, Detective, what is it?

19:13.823 --> 19:16.024
We have two more victims.

19:24.652 --> 19:27.596
So we now have three sexual
assaults by the same suspect?

19:27.631 --> 19:29.920
Yeah, the DNA from Adriana Gomez's
rape Kit got two hits.

19:29.954 --> 19:31.857
The first came from
an emergency room

19:31.891 --> 19:33.961
at USC hospital
about three months ago.

19:33.995 --> 19:35.931
LAPD Report says rape victim...

19:35.965 --> 19:38.433
Hispanic, early 30s...
was treated and released.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.903
She also had wounds
consistent with a stun gun.

19:40.937 --> 19:42.605
Could she identify
her attacker?

19:42.639 --> 19:44.607
No, and she refused
to file a complaint.

19:44.641 --> 19:45.708
Oh!

19:45.743 --> 19:47.477
What about the second victim?

19:47.512 --> 19:50.180
Second victim was a walk-in
at the Rape Treatment Center

19:50.215 --> 19:51.382
about six weeks ago.

19:51.416 --> 19:53.717
She also refused
to give any info.

19:53.751 --> 19:55.384
We're still waiting
for the incident report

19:55.418 --> 19:56.518
from Santa Monica PD,

19:56.552 --> 19:57.918
hoping to at least get
the victim's name.

19:57.952 --> 20:01.154
Okay, Lieutenant Tao,
would you please call the lab,

20:01.188 --> 20:02.854
find out how much longer
we have to wait

20:02.888 --> 20:04.287
for Gregory Disken's
DNA results?

20:04.322 --> 20:05.622
Tell them it's for Chief Pope.

20:07.324 --> 20:09.324
Chief, do you often use

20:09.358 --> 20:13.228
the name of a male supervisor
to get what you need?

20:13.262 --> 20:14.762
Of course.
Don't you?

20:14.797 --> 20:17.966
Okay, uh, Detective Gabriel,
let's do this in order.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.601
What's the name
of the first victim,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.236
the one from the ER
at USC hospital?

20:22.270 --> 20:24.505
Lupe Nava...

20:24.539 --> 20:26.107
No social security number,
no driver's license.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.475
And where does she live?

20:27.509 --> 20:30.444
Um, she left that part blank,

20:30.445 --> 20:31.645
but Lupe does give
her work address...

20:31.680 --> 20:33.514
The home of a Mr. Jeffrey Walters.

20:33.548 --> 20:35.849
Same zip code as the Diskens.

20:35.884 --> 20:38.585
Another nanny?

20:38.619 --> 20:39.953
Suspect has a type.

20:39.987 --> 20:42.022
Yeah, why would Lupe
give her work address

20:42.056 --> 20:43.456
and not her own address?

20:43.491 --> 20:45.859
Maybe she's a live-in.

20:45.893 --> 20:47.861
No, Lupe never lived here.

20:47.895 --> 20:50.297
I haven't seen or heard from her
in over a month.

20:50.331 --> 20:53.167
This is the only picture
I could find.

20:53.201 --> 20:54.968
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:55.670 --> 20:59.139
And you have no idea what
happened to Lupe, Mr. Walters?

20:59.173 --> 21:02.275
Uh, no. Like I said, she just
suddenly stopped showing up for work,

21:02.310 --> 21:04.044
you know, no warning,

21:04.079 --> 21:06.780
- right before my kid starts summer break.
- Thank you very much.

21:06.814 --> 21:09.249
I call her on her phone,
out of service...

21:09.283 --> 21:11.418
You know, classic stuff.

21:11.452 --> 21:14.323
I'm a single parent...
really left me hanging.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.657
I see you found a replacement.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.559
Hi. Uh...

21:19.593 --> 21:22.393
I went through dozens of girls
to find one I could stand.

21:22.428 --> 21:23.760
It wasn't easy.

21:26.363 --> 21:29.231
Excuse me, Chief.

21:29.266 --> 21:30.566
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.734
Hey, what...
what the hell was that?

21:32.768 --> 21:34.202
Excuse me.
What the hell was that?

21:34.236 --> 21:37.370
Sir, do either of these people
look familiar to you?

21:37.405 --> 21:40.405
Uh, no, they don't.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.474
I don't mean to come off
like a jerk here,

21:42.508 --> 21:44.308
but this is starting
to feel serious.

21:44.342 --> 21:45.642
Maybe I should talk
to my attorney.

21:45.677 --> 21:48.311
Do you feel you need to speak
to an attorney?

21:48.345 --> 21:51.680
No, I don't feel I need
to do that,

21:51.715 --> 21:53.515
but if Lupe did
something illegal,

21:53.549 --> 21:55.218
I had nothing
to do with it, okay,

21:55.252 --> 21:56.820
and I don't want to be involved.

21:56.854 --> 21:58.655
Maybe you could talk
to somebody else.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.990
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Walters,

22:01.024 --> 22:04.159
but you're the only
contact information

22:04.194 --> 22:06.896
that Lupe left behind
after she was raped.

22:06.931 --> 22:09.866
Uh, she...

22:09.900 --> 22:12.235
Three months ago,
your nanny was the victim

22:12.270 --> 22:15.007
Of a brutal sexual assault.

22:17.478 --> 22:19.951
I-I d...
I-I didn't know.

22:19.985 --> 22:22.754
I, uh... that's awful.

22:22.788 --> 22:25.089
It appears to be the work
of a serial rapist

22:25.124 --> 22:27.192
whose last victim was found dead
in her home.

22:27.226 --> 22:29.628
So it would mean a lot to us

22:29.663 --> 22:31.097
if you could help us find Lupe.

22:31.131 --> 22:33.365
Hey, I understand,
but, you know,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.201
like I said,
I have no idea where she lives.

22:36.236 --> 22:37.936
Sorry.

22:44.009 --> 22:47.811
Lieutenant Flynn, what can you
tell me about Jeff Walters?

22:47.846 --> 22:50.313
Well, he's a Talent Agent,
so we know he's an asshole.

22:50.348 --> 22:52.248
Other than that,
he's clean, Chief.

22:52.283 --> 22:56.485
I took the photos
of Lupe Nava and Jeff Walters,

22:56.519 --> 22:58.287
And I went over Adriana Gomez's
daily route again,

22:58.321 --> 23:00.822
And nobody recognized them.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.893
Well, there's just got to be some
connection among these women.

23:02.927 --> 23:04.262
We just need to find out
what it is.

23:04.296 --> 23:06.298
In the meantime,
I got no hits at the morgue

23:06.332 --> 23:09.769
for Lupe Nava or any Juanita Doe
who matches her description,

23:09.803 --> 23:12.138
which is good news.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.606
Well, she couldn't have
just disappeared.

23:13.641 --> 23:16.308
I'll call Fritz
and see if he can locate her

23:16.343 --> 23:19.311
from the Federal Immigration rolls.

23:19.346 --> 23:22.348
Something interesting, Captain?

23:22.382 --> 23:24.384
I was just thinking
how difficult it can be

23:24.418 --> 23:27.587
to get federal assistance
for an LAPD investigation

23:27.621 --> 23:30.122
and what an asset it is
to be married to an FBI Agent.

23:30.157 --> 23:31.523
What's that supposed to mean?

23:31.558 --> 23:34.927
Chief, we found
the third rape victim.

23:34.961 --> 23:36.829
Her name is Marisol Gutierrez.

23:36.863 --> 23:38.430
In the morgue?

23:38.465 --> 23:39.931
No, actually.

23:39.966 --> 23:42.033
She's in the interview room
with Lieutenant Tao.

23:42.067 --> 23:45.132
I was finally able to get her
address from Santa Monica PD,

23:45.167 --> 23:47.834
and, um, she's a nanny.

24:08.761 --> 24:11.829
Lieutenant, since she's not
a suspect, I can move the lens.

24:11.863 --> 24:13.331
So, do you think I should grab
a few freeze frames

24:13.365 --> 24:14.498
while I've got the chance?

24:14.533 --> 24:17.034
She won't be staying
to pose for pictures.

24:18.603 --> 24:21.138
Fire when ready, buzz.

24:34.048 --> 24:36.215
Should I ask
Detective Sanchez to come in?

24:36.250 --> 24:37.416
Oh, no, she speaks English,

24:37.450 --> 24:38.849
if you can get her to talk at all.

24:38.883 --> 24:40.617
Okay.

24:40.651 --> 24:42.084
Hi, Marisol.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.486
I'm Brenda.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.856
Um, so sorry to make you
come down here today.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.358
No one likes to be here,
I know.

24:53.392 --> 24:58.394
Now, I want you to understand
that you're not in any trouble.

24:58.429 --> 25:00.263
And everything you say
in this room

25:00.297 --> 25:01.597
is completely confidential.

25:01.632 --> 25:04.733
No sé nada.

25:04.767 --> 25:06.934
I don't know nothing.

25:06.969 --> 25:10.270
Please, do not send me back.

25:10.305 --> 25:13.406
Please, do not send me back.

25:14.541 --> 25:17.277
How you came into this country
is none of my business.

25:17.312 --> 25:21.149
All I care about
is finding the man who hurt you

25:21.183 --> 25:22.851
so he can't ever hurt
anyone else,

25:22.885 --> 25:25.587
Because that's
what he's doing, Marisol.

25:25.621 --> 25:26.754
He's hurting people.

25:35.729 --> 25:39.331
Now, do you recognize
either of these women?

25:44.570 --> 25:46.004
Okay.

25:46.038 --> 25:48.439
This is Adriana.

25:48.473 --> 25:50.441
She's a nanny, just like you.

25:53.244 --> 25:57.280
A few days ago,
someone entered her home,

25:57.314 --> 25:59.916
tortured her with a stun gun,

25:59.950 --> 26:03.920
and then he raped her.

26:03.954 --> 26:08.825
This is Lupe Nava.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.226
She's a nanny, too.

26:10.260 --> 26:13.162
Three months ago,

26:13.197 --> 26:16.799
she also was attacked
with a stun gun and raped.

26:16.834 --> 26:19.001
Now, the man who did this
to these women...

26:19.036 --> 26:21.971
...is the same man
who assaulted you.

26:22.005 --> 26:23.940
We know this now.

26:23.974 --> 26:27.276
Dios mío.

26:27.311 --> 26:28.778
Dios mío!

26:35.953 --> 26:36.986
Marisol.

26:42.092 --> 26:44.694
Do any of these men
look familiar to you?

26:49.534 --> 26:51.602
Marisol, please.

26:51.637 --> 26:56.107
Help me stop the monster
who did this.

26:56.141 --> 26:58.442
Marisol.

27:00.311 --> 27:02.613
Marisol, who did this to you?

27:10.056 --> 27:11.957
I don't know nothing.

27:30.037 --> 27:33.006
Federal Immigration reports
for the past six months.

27:33.040 --> 27:36.975
There are 243 Lupes,
Guadalupes, and Lupitas

27:37.010 --> 27:40.512
with the last name "Nava"
living in Los Angeles county.

27:40.546 --> 27:41.580
Great.

27:41.614 --> 27:42.883
Fortunately for you,

27:42.917 --> 27:46.721
only five of them fit the
description of your rape victim.

27:46.756 --> 27:49.990
Oh.
May I see your Lupe Nava?

27:50.025 --> 27:53.160
Two suspects, one dead nanny,

27:53.194 --> 27:55.495
another one who's vanished,
possibly dead,

27:55.529 --> 27:57.894
and one who's too scared
to talk to me.

27:57.928 --> 28:00.462
And all this with Captain Raydor
watching my every move.

28:00.496 --> 28:01.596
Ohh! That woman!

28:01.630 --> 28:02.896
Hey, hey, hey.

28:04.665 --> 28:05.731
Your lucky day.

28:07.799 --> 28:09.598
Oh, Fritzi.
There you go.

28:09.633 --> 28:11.899
Jeff Walters' missing nanny.

28:11.933 --> 28:14.400
Thank you. I need to talk to her
in the worst way.

28:14.435 --> 28:15.935
Oh, maybe not so lucky.

28:15.969 --> 28:17.737
According to immigration
and customs,

28:17.771 --> 28:20.839
Lupe Nava was deported
a month and a half ago.

28:20.874 --> 28:22.808
- To where?
- Mexico.

28:23.877 --> 28:25.644
Yep, that's her.

28:25.678 --> 28:27.279
Guadalupe Nava.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.782
I handled her "a" file.

28:29.817 --> 28:32.286
Fairly ordinary case,
from what I remember.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.989
Do you recall if Ms. Nava
reported being raped?

28:35.791 --> 28:39.130
Uh, yes.

28:39.164 --> 28:41.099
Actually, she did.

28:41.134 --> 28:42.568
Excuse me, uh, Agent Meyers,

28:42.602 --> 28:44.470
but exactly what about
sexual assault

28:44.504 --> 28:45.604
makes this case ordinary?

28:45.639 --> 28:48.741
Ma'am, there are over
a million illegal aliens

28:48.776 --> 28:50.210
living in LA County.

28:50.244 --> 28:51.711
When they end up
here in this office,

28:51.746 --> 28:53.580
they will say anything...
and I mean anything...

28:53.614 --> 28:54.948
to avoid removal,

28:54.983 --> 28:57.151
including that they were victims
of some crime.

28:57.185 --> 28:59.153
So you just assumed
that Lupe was lying?

28:59.188 --> 29:00.455
Yes.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.991
But that didn't stop me from
checking out her story, okay?

29:03.025 --> 29:04.626
Now, I called the DA's office

29:04.660 --> 29:06.728
to see if there was
a criminal rape case file

29:06.763 --> 29:08.931
with her name on it,
and there wasn't.

29:08.965 --> 29:12.501
And she waived a hearing,
opted for voluntary departure,

29:12.536 --> 29:15.638
which was another reason why
I didn't buy this rape claim.

29:20.211 --> 29:23.180
Ohh.

29:23.214 --> 29:25.281
Don't tell me.

29:25.316 --> 29:26.916
She was telling the truth?

29:26.950 --> 29:29.652
She really was raped?

29:29.687 --> 29:32.989
Along with two others
that we know about.

29:33.023 --> 29:36.025
Marisol Gutierrez

29:36.060 --> 29:37.960
and Adriana Gomez,

29:37.995 --> 29:39.995
who we found murdered.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.529
You have to understand.

29:41.564 --> 29:42.861
If she pushed this,

29:42.896 --> 29:45.529
I would have gotten an investigator
down here right away.

29:45.563 --> 29:47.628
- She could have fought this.
- Let me ask you...

29:47.663 --> 29:50.625
How did Lupe wind up in front
of you in the first place?

29:52.528 --> 29:56.497
She, uh... she was reported
by her employer,

29:56.531 --> 29:58.732
Jeffrey Walters.

29:59.801 --> 30:01.167
You want his address?

30:03.470 --> 30:05.804
I have it.

30:10.918 --> 30:13.420
- Mr. Walters, I have a warrant to search your house...
- What the hell are you doing here?

30:13.454 --> 30:15.889
For items belonging
to Lupe Nava

30:15.923 --> 30:17.390
and other evidence related
to her disappearance.

30:17.425 --> 30:18.958
Sir, do you own a stun gun?

30:18.993 --> 30:21.294
- What?
- Why didn't you tell me you were having sex with Lupe?

30:21.328 --> 30:22.962
What are you talking about?

30:22.996 --> 30:25.231
Well, I suppose rape doesn't have
anything to do with sex, does it?

30:25.265 --> 30:26.632
She says I raped her?

30:26.666 --> 30:29.802
She didn't say anything
because you had her deported.

30:29.836 --> 30:31.370
All right,
just hold on one second, okay?

30:31.404 --> 30:33.906
I never laid a hand
on Lupe, all right?

30:33.940 --> 30:37.142
Then you wouldn't mind giving us
a swab from your cheek, then.

30:37.176 --> 30:39.544
- Dad?
- Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

30:39.578 --> 30:40.945
Detective Sanchez,
would you please

30:40.979 --> 30:43.113
take Mr. Walters' son outside
for a moment?

30:43.148 --> 30:45.482
- Thank you.
- I'll... I'll be right there, okay?

30:47.484 --> 30:49.618
This is special Agent
Fritz Howard of the FBI.

30:49.653 --> 30:51.853
- He has a few questions for you.
- About what?

30:51.888 --> 30:54.322
Let's start with making false
statements to a Federal Agency,

30:54.356 --> 30:55.490
and then we can move on

30:55.524 --> 30:57.893
to violating the Immigration
and Nationality Act.

30:57.927 --> 31:00.729
Chief, your suspect,
uh, went that way.

31:00.763 --> 31:04.166
Children know more about
their nannies than anyone.

31:04.201 --> 31:08.105
So, tell me, Leo,
the last time you saw Lupe,

31:08.139 --> 31:10.174
did she seem worried
or upset to you?

31:10.208 --> 31:12.209
No, unh-unh.

31:12.243 --> 31:14.078
I mean, she was the same.

31:14.112 --> 31:16.680
We just went to the park,
like always.

31:16.715 --> 31:18.815
Who'd you see at the park?

31:18.849 --> 31:20.516
No one, really.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.684
None of my friends
really go there anymore.

31:22.718 --> 31:23.852
Why not?

31:23.887 --> 31:26.655
Well, I mean, Jeremy,

31:26.690 --> 31:28.690
he's with his family
in England.

31:28.725 --> 31:32.427
And Ollie went to
a baseball camp.

31:32.462 --> 31:35.197
I don't know what the heck
happened to Ruben.

31:35.231 --> 31:37.933
Excuse me.
Did you say Ruben?

31:37.967 --> 31:40.102
Uh-huh.

31:40.136 --> 31:42.037
You think it's the same Ruben
Avery Disken was talking about?

31:42.071 --> 31:43.906
His friend from the park?

31:46.876 --> 31:49.211
You ever see this kid before?

31:49.246 --> 31:50.679
His name is Avery.

31:52.382 --> 31:55.551
Um, no.
Unh-unh.

31:55.586 --> 31:57.988
Detective Sanchez, would you
please call Agent Meyers at ICE

31:58.022 --> 32:00.958
and see if he has a Ruben
in his files?

32:00.992 --> 32:02.793
Thank you.

32:02.828 --> 32:06.529
Leo, can you tell us
how to find Ruben?

32:06.563 --> 32:09.727
No, I don't have
his phone number or anything.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.159
But we're Facebook friends.

32:12.193 --> 32:15.163
Is, uh, Adriana okay?

32:15.197 --> 32:17.367
D-did you guys find her?

32:19.770 --> 32:22.738
We're trying to locate
her family in Mexico.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.406
Avery, how old is Ruben?

32:24.440 --> 32:27.542
My age, I guess,
maybe a little younger.

32:27.576 --> 32:29.042
Adriana wouldn't
go back to Mexico.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.144
- What's going on?
- Mr. Disken, hello.

32:31.178 --> 32:33.746
- You have no right to barge
in here and question my son.
- Your wife let us in.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.581
It's okay.
Daddy's just concerned, okay?

32:36.616 --> 32:38.849
It's all right.
Don't worry.

32:38.883 --> 32:40.116
This has gone way too far.

32:40.151 --> 32:41.852
You cannot bring the children
into this.

32:41.886 --> 32:44.154
- We haven't told them about Adriana.
- Neither have I.

32:44.188 --> 32:45.922
- Sir, I assure you...
- You are not hearing me.

32:45.956 --> 32:47.891
Get your people out
of my son's room now!

32:47.926 --> 32:49.827
Sir, I'm very close
to solving this case,

32:49.861 --> 32:52.429
and if you interfere with me
any more, I will arrest you.

32:52.464 --> 32:56.032
I already have an FBI Agent
at the home of another suspect.

32:56.067 --> 32:57.434
I'd be happy
to do the same for you.

32:57.468 --> 32:58.602
What makes me a suspect?

32:58.636 --> 33:00.971
Well, you certainly have
a lot of rage.

33:01.005 --> 33:02.172
That fits the bill.

33:02.206 --> 33:07.076
Now stand out here
and be very, very quiet.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.249
It's all right.
Go on.

33:15.852 --> 33:18.786
Ruben hasn't updated his status
in a long time,

33:18.820 --> 33:21.187
but, uh, here he is.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.056
Now, the profile page
just says "Ruben".

33:26.091 --> 33:27.858
Do you know his last name?

33:27.892 --> 33:30.961
Unh-unh.
He... he never told me.

33:30.995 --> 33:34.331
This is his, uh, photo page.

33:36.534 --> 33:39.669
Who's that?

33:40.738 --> 33:43.640
Ruben's dad, I-I guess.

33:43.674 --> 33:45.975
Oh, my.

33:46.010 --> 33:47.477
Detective Sanchez,

33:47.511 --> 33:49.645
were you able to contact
Agent Meyers about Ruben?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.381
He wasn't in the office.
I left a message on his cell.

33:52.416 --> 33:54.784
Do you want me to try his house?

33:55.752 --> 33:57.119
Agent Meyers?

33:57.154 --> 33:59.755
Deputy Chief Johnson.
Is now a good time?

34:03.194 --> 34:04.794
Agent Meyers?

34:07.131 --> 34:09.800
In here!

34:12.036 --> 34:14.105
Go away!
Get out! Ow!

34:14.139 --> 34:15.505
It's okay.
Don't move.
Ow!

34:15.540 --> 34:17.107
It's okay.
Ow!

34:17.141 --> 34:19.275
Don't move.
Chief.

34:19.309 --> 34:21.577
Darts from a stun gun.

34:21.610 --> 34:22.976
You can't be here!
Get out!

34:23.012 --> 34:24.112
Ruben, it's okay.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.447
We're the police.
We're here help you.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.349
I'm already in so much trouble.

34:27.382 --> 34:30.018
- Who? Who? Who are you in trouble with?
- My dad.

34:30.053 --> 34:31.987
I'll call paramedics.

34:32.022 --> 34:34.123
Ruben, can you tell me
where your dad went?

34:34.158 --> 34:36.860
No, he... he took the van
from work. He's gone.

34:36.895 --> 34:39.429
Detective Sanchez, stay here
until paramedics arrive.

34:40.498 --> 34:42.667
- Chief, Meyers is not here.
- Of course not.

34:42.701 --> 34:45.337
Oh! I told him everything
I know about the case.

34:45.371 --> 34:46.605
Slow.
Easy, easy.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.906
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

34:47.940 --> 34:49.341
Where did he go?
Where did he go?

34:49.375 --> 34:51.743
Meyers was targeting
illegal aliens.

34:51.777 --> 34:53.411
But Adriana
was an American citizen.

34:53.445 --> 34:55.312
That's why he killed her.

34:55.347 --> 34:58.181
He couldn't silence her
with deportation.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.649
Oh, my God.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.917
He's going after Marisol.

35:01.951 --> 35:03.452
Why would he bother?
We have his DNA.

35:03.486 --> 35:04.786
That's the one thing
I didn't tell him.

35:04.820 --> 35:06.821
He's really angry.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.023
No, Fritz. You're only five
or six blocks away.

35:09.058 --> 35:10.858
Just turn left
on Valley Ridge, okay?

35:10.892 --> 35:12.960
At this time of night, it's
gonna take SWAT at least an hour

35:12.994 --> 35:14.394
to get in position,
assuming he's here.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.629
He is.
There's his van.

35:16.664 --> 35:18.664
All right, Tao, Flynn,
box him in. Box him in now.

35:18.698 --> 35:20.833
Let's go.

35:26.273 --> 35:27.806
Chief, get back!

35:27.841 --> 35:28.974
Get back, get back!

35:29.008 --> 35:31.409
Back away!

35:31.444 --> 35:33.078
Back away!
Back away!

35:33.112 --> 35:34.979
Drop your weapon
and let her go now!

35:35.013 --> 35:37.281
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's not do anything stupid.

35:37.315 --> 35:40.317
I am serious.
Move your cars now!

35:40.351 --> 35:42.719
Let her go,
and then we can talk, okay?

35:42.753 --> 35:45.155
I'm not standing around,
waiting for SWAT.

35:45.189 --> 35:49.190
Move your cars, or I will
put a bullet in her head.

35:49.224 --> 35:50.757
Chief, back up!

35:50.791 --> 35:52.925
Look, look, look, let's j-just
keep our cool, okay?

35:54.894 --> 35:57.062
You move your cars right now,

35:57.096 --> 35:59.431
or I will blow her brains
all over this sidewalk!

35:59.465 --> 36:00.399
Shut up!

36:00.433 --> 36:01.600
Critical situation.

36:01.634 --> 36:02.734
Officers in jeopardy.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.069
Uprs have been requested.

36:04.104 --> 36:05.372
- Someone help me.
- Shut up!

36:05.406 --> 36:06.375
Rifles now.

36:06.409 --> 36:08.345
Back up, Chief.
Chief, back up!

36:08.380 --> 36:10.382
A-agent Meyers,
let's just calm down.

36:10.417 --> 36:13.219
Let's just keep our cool.
We can walk away peacefully.

36:13.254 --> 36:17.591
Just move your cars
and back away now.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.959
Back away!

36:18.994 --> 36:21.095
shut up!

36:21.129 --> 36:23.364
There's only one way for all
of us to get out of here alive,

36:23.399 --> 36:27.202
and that is for you to drop
your weapon and come with me.

36:27.236 --> 36:28.270
Back up.

36:28.304 --> 36:30.638
I will let her go
when I am out of here.

36:30.673 --> 36:32.639
This is not a negotiation,
Agent Meyers.

36:32.674 --> 36:33.707
Drop it!

36:35.342 --> 36:36.309
You shoot her,

36:36.343 --> 36:37.309
we will kill you.

36:37.344 --> 36:38.710
If you run, we will kill you.

36:38.745 --> 36:41.412
If you do not drop your weapon,
we will kill you.

36:41.447 --> 36:43.647
Let her go and get down
on the ground now!

36:43.682 --> 36:47.283
If I'm gonna die, then I am
taking this wetback with me.

36:47.317 --> 36:48.984
And maybe you, too.
Now back off!

36:49.019 --> 36:51.653
This is your last chance.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.087
Let her go!

36:54.423 --> 36:55.589
Shut up.
Shut up!

37:08.266 --> 37:09.733
Bitch!

37:21.715 --> 37:24.051
Brenda!
Brenda!

37:26.722 --> 37:28.089
Brenda!

37:28.124 --> 37:29.358
I'm okay.

37:29.392 --> 37:31.627
Okay? Okay?
You almost got yourself killed!

37:31.661 --> 37:34.196
Never, ever do that again.
You hear me?

37:34.230 --> 37:36.698
Chief!

37:36.733 --> 37:38.200
All right.

37:38.235 --> 37:39.368
Okay?

37:43.841 --> 37:44.774
Oh.

38:04.541 --> 38:05.841
How is he?

38:09.879 --> 38:11.179
Better.

38:12.815 --> 38:14.782
Get this...
When Ruben was hanging out

38:14.817 --> 38:16.618
with those other kids
at the park,

38:16.652 --> 38:18.586
he thought he was doing
undercover work,

38:18.620 --> 38:19.620
identifying illegals.

38:19.654 --> 38:22.089
Then his dad would rape them.

38:22.124 --> 38:24.325
Hm.

38:24.359 --> 38:27.528
You're sure that he didn't know
what was going on?

38:27.562 --> 38:30.864
He has bruises...

38:30.898 --> 38:34.100
That are older
than the ones he got today.

38:34.134 --> 38:35.968
Okay?

38:37.304 --> 38:38.971
Okay.

38:41.808 --> 38:44.009
Any word about his mother?

38:44.044 --> 38:47.780
All Ruben remembers
is about four years ago,

38:47.814 --> 38:49.982
they took a family trip
down to Tijuana,

38:50.016 --> 38:52.050
and they left without her.

38:54.053 --> 38:56.393
All right.

38:56.428 --> 38:59.365
Um...Better call in
children's services.

38:59.399 --> 39:01.801
Sir, if he goes into the system,

39:01.835 --> 39:03.736
They're gonna put him on a list.

39:03.771 --> 39:06.672
They're not even gonna try
to find his mother for months.

39:06.707 --> 39:09.041
Finding his mom comes later.

39:09.076 --> 39:11.677
Now, Detective...
right now...

39:11.711 --> 39:15.781
This kid needs someone
to look after him.

39:20.887 --> 39:24.190
Julio...

39:24.224 --> 39:26.926
If you want, stay with him

39:26.960 --> 39:29.830
until the children's services
people show up.

39:56.658 --> 39:58.826
Oh, Captain Raydor.

39:58.860 --> 40:00.828
Come in.

40:00.863 --> 40:02.731
I just wanted
to say thank you.

40:02.765 --> 40:04.766
Since your husband
neutralized Joe Meyers,

40:04.801 --> 40:07.236
the FBI gets to do
all the after-action clean-up.

40:07.270 --> 40:11.240
All of Internal Affairs
owes you a huge favor.

40:11.274 --> 40:14.210
Well, any chance I can get

40:14.244 --> 40:17.013
to make your life
a little easier.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.917
And you showed great bravery.

40:23.218 --> 40:24.551
Well, thank you.

40:24.586 --> 40:27.888
But, um, the credit goes
to all of Major Crimes...

40:27.922 --> 40:30.090
And, of course, Chief Pope.

40:30.124 --> 40:31.958
By the way, I think
that you'll be pleased to know

40:31.992 --> 40:34.761
that I've completed
my investigation.

40:34.795 --> 40:37.962
Oh? You finished
your background on Chief Pope?

40:37.997 --> 40:40.864
I didn't say I was doing a
background check on Chief Pope.

40:40.898 --> 40:43.632
As the LAPD's Women's Coordinator,

40:43.667 --> 40:46.068
I am on the Search Committee
for our new boss.

40:46.103 --> 40:48.304
The Mayor and the Police Commission

40:48.338 --> 40:51.206
want a strong female candidate
in the mix.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.442
You are the highest-ranking woman

40:53.476 --> 40:57.613
in the Department now, so...

41:00.851 --> 41:02.385
What's this?

41:02.419 --> 41:05.088
It's an application...

41:05.122 --> 41:08.292
For the Chief of the LAPD.

41:10.528 --> 41:15.366
All candidates need to get one
in within the next two weeks.

41:23.042 --> 41:25.610
I see it's already
been filled out for me.

41:25.645 --> 41:27.613
All it needs is your signature.

41:28.748 --> 41:30.516
From our conversations,

41:30.550 --> 41:32.818
I gather that you are still
very close to Chief Pope.

41:32.853 --> 41:35.989
I do hope that
this incredible opportunity

41:36.023 --> 41:41.561
doesn't, um, cause any friction
between the two of you.

41:45.933 --> 41:49.164
Two weeks, Chief Johnson.

41:54.268 --> 41:56.402
Chief of Police?

41:57.003 --> 41:59.003
