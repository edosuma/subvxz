00:18.874 --> 00:20.954
Welcome to America.

00:31.994 --> 00:34.474
Empty your pockets, please, sir.

00:40.594 --> 00:44.554
-Where have we got him?
-The east wing, Sir.

00:44.714 --> 00:47.514
-Great.
-Stand here, please.

00:47.674 --> 00:50.914
They're putting him up
on secured eastern wing.

00:51.074 --> 00:53.674
It ain't fancy,
but it's the best we got.

00:53.834 --> 00:59.154
-Want me to stick around?
-No, no need to. Get yourself home.

00:59.314 --> 01:01.994
Okay, I'll head home.

01:02.154 --> 01:04.154
Where the hell is it?

01:04.314 --> 01:08.514
-Is everything okay, sir?
-I'm missing a photo.

01:08.674 --> 01:13.234
-What's going on?
-Ileana's photo, it's gone.

01:13.394 --> 01:15.474
Don't worry, we'll find it.

01:44.434 --> 01:48.554
It's not the Hilton,
but at least it's American soil.

01:59.754 --> 02:04.714
Last time I had the photo,
it was in the jacket.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.114
I'm afraid that ended up
in the Rhine.

02:07.274 --> 02:11.274
Can you ask the police? If they have
the jacket, they have the photo.

02:11.434 --> 02:13.834
Even if they have it,
it's been in the water.

02:13.994 --> 02:15.794
It might be ruined.

02:29.034 --> 02:30.874
Oh, hey.

02:35.274 --> 02:39.434
Hey, Fluff. How are you?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.634
How are you?

02:44.954 --> 02:46.674
You hungry?

02:52.194 --> 02:54.434
Let's take a look at you.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.954
There we are.

02:59.314 --> 03:03.514
You smell different. What is that?

03:04.834 --> 03:07.034
You want some food? Come on.

05:07.194 --> 05:10.954
This just in, we have
no official confirmation

05:11.114 --> 05:12.714
from the German police yet,

05:12.874 --> 05:16.554
but sources are telling us
Victor Godeanu was seen alive

05:16.714 --> 05:19.954
and in the presence
of American officials.

05:20.114 --> 05:23.034
-They're just in time.
-That's great, sir.

05:26.634 --> 05:28.834
-This is Frank.
- Where is he?

05:28.994 --> 05:33.154
-Hello, Scott. In the secure wing.
-He better make himself comfortable.

05:33.314 --> 05:36.394
Because Carter won't sign off
on an extraction.

05:36.554 --> 05:38.154
-What? Why?
-"Why?"

05:38.314 --> 05:40.954
Instead of brokering peace
in the Middle East,

05:41.114 --> 05:43.714
he's having to shut down rumors
about a defector.

05:43.874 --> 05:46.314
That's why he's really pissed.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.594
You're on thin ice, Frank.

05:56.074 --> 05:58.594
What, now he's suddenly a defector?

05:59.634 --> 06:03.074
We believe he is with the Americans,
in a secret location.

06:03.234 --> 06:07.274
First, you say he's a KGB agent,
now he's defected to the CIA?

06:09.434 --> 06:12.074
It makes sense
if he's a double agent.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.194
Bastard!

06:20.714 --> 06:24.874
Send an urgent extradition request
to the German chancellor.

06:25.034 --> 06:29.114
-Their Home Affairs too.
-We'll use unofficial channels too.

06:29.274 --> 06:33.754
Tell them Godeanu is
a bloody murderer. Use all we have.

06:33.914 --> 06:39.394
Ruin him, slander him!
Compromise him!

06:39.554 --> 06:42.594
Or even better,
leave for Germany now.

06:42.754 --> 06:46.594
Find him and kill him.
Pay an assassin a million dollars.

06:46.754 --> 06:50.514
-Whatever it takes!
-Move!

06:55.714 --> 06:58.914
We have to interrogate every bastard
who worked for Victor.

06:59.074 --> 07:00.754
The Security's on it already.

07:02.994 --> 07:05.074
We have to make them all suffer.

07:05.234 --> 07:07.434
His family most of all!
Don't you see it?

07:19.554 --> 07:22.074
-Are you sure it's here?
-Yes.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.874
Dad wouldn't send us just anywhere.

07:28.114 --> 07:32.474
Hello, Dr. Urdea.
My name is Ileana Godeanu.

07:32.634 --> 07:38.514
My father talked to you
about a small intervention.

07:38.674 --> 07:40.434
What intervention?

07:40.594 --> 07:44.034
He told you I'd come
with a friend for...

07:45.994 --> 07:51.074
For what? Not an abortion, I hope.
That is illegal.

07:51.234 --> 07:55.594
-Ileana, let's go.
-Wait. I can talk to my dad.

07:55.754 --> 07:59.514
He ran off to the Americans.
I doubt you can talk to him.

07:59.674 --> 08:02.114
-Not true.
-Unless you're following him.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.714
-It's not true.
-Ileana, let's go!

08:05.874 --> 08:07.434
Listen to your friend.

08:09.554 --> 08:12.554
What do I do now?
My dad will kill me!

08:12.714 --> 08:16.554
-We'll find a way.
-I'll have to do it myself.

08:16.714 --> 08:20.114
-No, you could die.
-I'll find a way.

08:20.274 --> 08:21.714
What way, Ileana?

08:21.874 --> 08:25.154
If your dad's with the Americans,
you're finished too!

08:40.634 --> 08:46.594
-Adela? What are you doing here?
-Hi, Daniel.

08:47.634 --> 08:49.434
Missed me?

08:51.274 --> 08:54.114
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure.

08:55.554 --> 08:58.794
I want to return to acting.
I wanted to tell you first.

09:00.074 --> 09:05.354
A little birdie told me you're doing
Shakespeare, my first love.

09:05.514 --> 09:08.754
Yes, dear, in theory.

09:08.914 --> 09:12.314
But it's impossible
in the current situation.

09:12.474 --> 09:13.994
Hello, Comrade Godeanu.

09:19.274 --> 09:21.074
Please follow me.

09:23.394 --> 09:26.874
Right now?
I was having a conversation.

09:33.474 --> 09:36.874
Your husband defected to the CIA.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.074
It's a joke, right?

09:44.474 --> 09:45.994
What?

09:49.114 --> 09:52.354
That can't be. Victor wouldn't--

09:52.514 --> 09:55.594
Comrade Elena Ceaușescu wants
to see you.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.834
Now.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.954
Tell us. Why are you here?

10:14.714 --> 10:16.754
Don't know where to start.

10:16.914 --> 10:18.314
If you believed in God,

10:18.474 --> 10:21.794
I'd say treat it like a confession,
but you don't.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.434
So go with the truth.

10:26.114 --> 10:29.754
I am the advisor
to President Nicolae Ceaușescu.

10:29.914 --> 10:33.714
Acting Deputy Chief of Foreign
Intelligence and State Secretary

10:33.874 --> 10:36.514
for Romania's Ministry
of the Interior.

10:37.674 --> 10:41.834
You guys over there
just rake in the titles, don't you?

10:41.994 --> 10:44.954
Mr. Simpson, we need you in room 122.

10:53.594 --> 10:56.434
Sorry, he's an acquired taste.

10:59.274 --> 11:01.994
Please, go ahead.

11:09.434 --> 11:12.994
I was in charge with setting up
hundreds of espionage operations

11:13.154 --> 11:15.234
in the West and the Middle East.

11:15.394 --> 11:21.714
I sent over 500 undercover agents
abroad. Engineers, teachers, doctors,

11:21.874 --> 11:25.874
art instructors, religious servants,
you name it.

11:26.034 --> 11:28.034
For all kinds of operations,

11:28.194 --> 11:32.474
especially to acquire military
and technology secrets from the West.

11:36.754 --> 11:38.554
I used to run a secret department

11:38.714 --> 11:41.794
in charge of stealing invention
patents from the West.

11:41.954 --> 11:45.954
I'll be damned.
That will fill an entire chapter.

11:46.114 --> 11:48.434
We'll get into more details later.

11:48.594 --> 11:52.954
For now, tell me about the Soviet
intelligence machinery you used.

11:54.314 --> 11:58.674
We cultivated an array
of false narratives, dupes,

11:58.834 --> 12:01.594
to plant seeds of mistrust
in the Americans' minds

12:01.754 --> 12:07.074
about involvement in the Vietnam War
and other foreign operations.

12:07.234 --> 12:10.954
With the disinformation apparatus,
we managed to trick your President

12:11.114 --> 12:15.354
into believing that Ceaușescu
is a trustworthy ally.

12:15.514 --> 12:20.914
He's not. He's a cruel dictator
and a murderer.

12:42.114 --> 12:46.914
Hello, Elena. Comrade Academician.

12:49.194 --> 12:51.154
You can go, Mircea.

12:53.914 --> 12:55.674
Tell me all you know.

12:57.914 --> 12:59.794
I don't know anything.

12:59.954 --> 13:02.714
Your man ran to the CIA
and you don't know anything?

13:02.874 --> 13:07.754
I found out just before I came here.

13:07.914 --> 13:12.034
I'm as shocked as you are. Angry too.

13:12.194 --> 13:14.554
I can't believe he did this.

13:14.714 --> 13:20.114
-He betrayed us all. You had to know!
-I didn't know.

13:20.274 --> 13:25.514
Elena, Comrade Academician.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.194
Our marriage had long been...

13:29.234 --> 13:34.314
-We've had problems, we barely spoke.
-So what?

13:34.474 --> 13:37.554
What wife doesn't know
what her husband is doing?

13:37.714 --> 13:43.554
What if he slept with some CIA broad?
You'd have to be a complete idiot.

13:43.714 --> 13:48.674
-Victor never discussed work.
-You're lying!

13:48.834 --> 13:51.114
You had him wrapped
around your finger.

13:51.274 --> 13:53.434
You're an actress.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.394
Former actress.

14:00.634 --> 14:05.674
Comrade Academician.
These last few years,

14:05.834 --> 14:09.074
all I asked was for him
to care about our marriage.

14:10.274 --> 14:17.114
And if he betrayed his country,
he should die. It's what he deserves.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.234
We need to go into more specifics.

14:23.194 --> 14:26.194
Not before you guarantee me
one thing.

14:27.474 --> 14:29.074
I want my daughter out.

14:36.514 --> 14:40.874
You know Ceaușescu
will not just let her go.

14:41.034 --> 14:44.194
We need a black op team
to take her out, and that is...

14:44.354 --> 14:46.394
not my call to make.

14:49.754 --> 14:52.594
You got me here
by playing the game your rules.

14:52.754 --> 14:55.594
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make this happen.

14:56.714 --> 14:59.994
I had several agents' files
on my desk.

15:00.154 --> 15:01.834
Yours impressed me the most.

15:03.434 --> 15:08.674
You broke the rules,
almost got kicked out,

15:08.834 --> 15:11.714
yet here you are.

15:11.874 --> 15:14.554
In Romania, we call it "balls."

15:20.474 --> 15:25.154
-To having balls.
-To having balls.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.074
Mum?

15:59.434 --> 16:05.154
Ileana, Comrade Ioan Albescu,
from the Party.

16:06.994 --> 16:08.874
Your father...

16:10.874 --> 16:16.354
Your father, he left us.
He's in America now.

16:16.514 --> 16:21.474
-Defected to the CIA.
-No, Dad would never do that.

16:21.634 --> 16:24.634
I wish it wasn't true, but it is.

16:24.794 --> 16:28.274
I'm sorry,
but your father is a traitor.

16:46.314 --> 16:48.634
Camp David is hanging by a thread.

16:48.794 --> 16:52.594
There is a perceived general lack
of flexibility on both sides,

16:52.754 --> 16:56.954
as Begin won't entertain
the idea of closing down settlements

16:57.114 --> 17:00.114
and Sadat wants
a   complete   withdrawal.

17:00.274 --> 17:02.954
Sources tell us,
President   Carter   himself

17:03.114 --> 17:05.714
is running out of tricks
and   patience.

17:05.874 --> 17:12.274
The   issue of   the   Israeli   settlements
might sink the peace talks after all.

17:24.034 --> 17:26.274
A minute, my dear.

18:08.874 --> 18:11.874
Wait, you're working with him?

18:12.034 --> 18:15.354
It's just a small business.

18:15.514 --> 18:18.034
Since when is my brother
a businessman?

18:18.194 --> 18:20.714
Don't be disrespectful, Safiya.

18:20.874 --> 18:24.514
You know he's been so kind to us.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.234
Thank you.

19:32.114 --> 19:34.994
The Secret Police is here!
Sorin, is this about you?

19:35.154 --> 19:37.994
I have to hang up,
they want to search your office.

19:54.034 --> 19:57.114
I want a secure line to Romania.

19:57.274 --> 19:59.674
They called me back to Bucharest.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.954
My wife is very worried.

20:04.114 --> 20:08.154
It's our fault,
we should have watched for signs.

20:08.314 --> 20:10.754
-Will they arrest me?
-We're innocent.

20:10.914 --> 20:14.194
We didn't break any protocol.

20:14.354 --> 20:16.994
There are gaps in my reports.

20:17.154 --> 20:18.554
For more than 30 minutes,

20:18.714 --> 20:21.074
I didn't know
where comrade Godeanu was.

20:21.234 --> 20:23.674
If you weren't vigilant,
it's your fault.

20:40.794 --> 20:44.954
Put me through to Mircea Voinea
in Counterintelligence.

21:01.874 --> 21:06.394
-I contacted all agents in the area.
-I'll be there tomorrow.

21:06.554 --> 21:10.874
-Our orders?
-We take him out.

21:11.034 --> 21:14.714
We'll need all the details
we can get. Make a plan.

21:17.154 --> 21:21.594
I don't have all we need
to avoid drawing attention.

21:21.754 --> 21:25.034
Don't worry,
I got some things moving.

21:50.994 --> 21:55.034
Why the Netherlands?
We have our jobs, this is home.

21:55.194 --> 21:57.914
We can make a new home there.

21:58.074 --> 22:01.514
We'll have a better life.
Have faith, Safiya.

22:04.474 --> 22:07.714
Don't touch that! It's Jabare's.

22:11.114 --> 22:14.034
-Let's go.
-All right.

22:20.394 --> 22:24.994
Calm down.

22:27.194 --> 22:29.834
What is this? Why is Jabare armed?

22:29.994 --> 22:32.954
-For protection, don't worry.
-Be careful!

22:33.114 --> 22:35.474
-I have to go.
-Where to?

22:35.634 --> 22:38.514
Don't let Jabare drag you
into his mess!

22:38.674 --> 22:41.034
Don't say that! He's your own blood.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.594
Hey.

24:49.754 --> 24:53.274
Baby steps
towards the American dream.

24:57.994 --> 25:02.554
You know, as a kid, I wanted to be
as good as Wilt Chamberlain.

25:02.714 --> 25:04.154
Who's that?

25:04.314 --> 25:07.434
One of the greatest
basketball players ever.

25:09.034 --> 25:10.794
Who did you want to be?

25:15.554 --> 25:19.194
My dreams were much simpler,
almost basic.

25:19.354 --> 25:24.514
-Like what?
-Like having the nicest shoes,

25:24.674 --> 25:29.034
traveling to Paris, to London,
eating good candy.

25:31.954 --> 25:37.594
-They used to call me Candy Boy?
-Really? Never would have guessed.

25:37.754 --> 25:40.874
No one would.

25:41.034 --> 25:45.194
It was because of my father,
he used to work in a candy factory.

25:45.354 --> 25:47.554
And we had lots of candy.

25:51.754 --> 25:56.554
And I shared those candies.
With all my friends all the time.

25:56.714 --> 25:58.354
When my father found out,

25:58.514 --> 26:01.274
he told me if anyone knew
about it, he'd go to jail.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.914
I had no idea he was exchanging
the stolen candies

26:05.074 --> 26:07.194
for food or other goods.

26:10.234 --> 26:14.154
Then he gave me my first lesson
on how to work around the system.

26:14.314 --> 26:16.074
He said "If you wanna make it,

26:16.234 --> 26:18.754
you have to understand
the people's needs.

26:18.914 --> 26:21.874
If you can't meet them,
find someone who can."

26:22.034 --> 26:24.874
Quite a smart man, your father.

26:25.034 --> 26:27.754
I was 10 years old
when I learned how to lie.

26:27.914 --> 26:30.714
First, to protect my father,
then to survive.

26:34.314 --> 26:37.554
A few days ago,
Ceaușescu asked me to kill someone.

26:37.714 --> 26:40.594
Just to test my loyalty.

26:42.194 --> 26:44.674
In that moment,
I was done with Communism.

26:46.834 --> 26:52.754
I wanted out. To America.
I wanted to be free.

26:52.914 --> 26:56.154
Ceaușescu would say anything
to get Godeanu back.

26:56.314 --> 26:59.794
We don't even know
if any of the accusations are true.

26:59.954 --> 27:04.954
Do we know if he's still in Germany
or in the US already?

27:05.114 --> 27:07.474
The Americans are keeping mum.

27:09.114 --> 27:10.874
If he's in their military base,

27:11.034 --> 27:14.074
it's German territory,
our jurisdiction.

27:14.234 --> 27:18.354
If he's in their embassy,
I'll ask Simpson, he owes me one.

27:18.514 --> 27:24.794
We must know if he's talking
and what names he's disclosed.

27:24.954 --> 27:28.674
Excuse me. Should I join you?

27:30.194 --> 27:31.594
No.

27:40.234 --> 27:43.754
She's recently been questioned
regarding Godeanu.

27:47.114 --> 27:51.914
-Do you have reason to suspect her?
-No.

27:53.194 --> 27:56.634
But maybe we should reconsider.

27:56.794 --> 27:59.434
When did you meet Ingrid?

28:01.514 --> 28:06.834
-A few years ago, at a bar.
-We need you to be more specific.

28:08.474 --> 28:12.154
We bumped into each other.
I was boozed, she was pretty.

28:14.554 --> 28:18.714
Makes sense.
Did you try to recruit her?

28:18.874 --> 28:20.634
No.

28:20.794 --> 28:22.114
Why not?

28:24.474 --> 28:28.634
It might surprise you, but we don't
always try to recruit a pretty woman.

28:28.794 --> 28:33.794
Sometimes, like James Bond,
we just want to sleep with her.

28:33.954 --> 28:37.114
Did it become
a romantic relationship?

28:41.594 --> 28:44.794
-Let's say we had a thing.
-A "thing?"

28:48.234 --> 28:50.714
And how long did this "thing" last?

28:51.954 --> 28:54.674
A few months, maybe a year.

28:56.434 --> 28:59.994
Did you ask her to help you
with any of your missions?

29:00.154 --> 29:02.994
Her profile didn't qualify her
for more.

29:03.154 --> 29:05.594
-She's not made for this job.
-Why not?

29:05.754 --> 29:07.314
She's too...

29:10.754 --> 29:14.754
She is too emotional.

29:16.314 --> 29:21.474
-Hey there, Lois.
-Hi, Frank. He's in a meeting.

29:21.634 --> 29:23.594
We'll see what we can do.

29:28.394 --> 29:30.234
This way, please.

29:30.394 --> 29:35.234
-What did BND want?
-He just wanted a word with Godeanu.

29:35.394 --> 29:38.914
-Why wasn't I consulted about it?
-Because you weren't here.

29:39.074 --> 29:41.874
They can't question my guy
without me.

29:42.034 --> 29:45.394
He's not your guy, Frank.
He's the CIA's guy.

29:45.554 --> 29:50.274
He knows about the Stasi informant.
Ms. von Weizendorff.

29:50.434 --> 29:53.434
-Get John to check her up.
-Eddie is already on it.

29:53.594 --> 29:54.994
Good.

29:57.554 --> 30:02.314
Our source says Ceaușescu
wants to reach out to Carter.

30:02.474 --> 30:07.194
Carter won't answer my calls,
fucking imperialist!

30:07.354 --> 30:08.874
That idiot farmer!

30:09.034 --> 30:12.114
We have to discredit Victor
everywhere,

30:12.274 --> 30:14.514
make the Americans drop him.

30:14.674 --> 30:16.674
I can't do that now!

30:16.834 --> 30:20.994
They'll think I was an idiot
for trusting him all these years!

30:21.154 --> 30:24.354
Nicu, look at me. You're the victim.

30:24.514 --> 30:28.194
Make them all see
this monster coerced you.

30:30.554 --> 30:33.474
Right. I know what I'll do.

31:21.034 --> 31:24.474
-I have some information for you.
-Who are you?

31:24.634 --> 31:26.874
I work
for the Romanian government.

31:27.034 --> 31:29.634
It's about Victor Godeanu,
can we talk?

31:30.994 --> 31:32.474
Okay.

31:32.634 --> 31:36.314
Have you not asked yourself,
why did he defect now?

31:36.474 --> 31:38.154
Why not earlier?

31:38.314 --> 31:41.594
Godeanu was in France
with his daughter a few months ago,

31:41.754 --> 31:43.514
why didn't he do it back then?

31:43.674 --> 31:46.234
He could have taken
his daughter with him.

31:51.394 --> 31:54.994
This is Godeanu's warehouse.

31:55.154 --> 31:56.474
He ran a smuggling ring

31:56.634 --> 31:58.954
that would have made
the Mafia jealous.

32:00.634 --> 32:04.594
To me, this is just a room full
of stuff.

32:04.754 --> 32:08.194
-How do I know it's his warehouse?
-Allow me.

32:09.954 --> 32:11.554
His wife.

32:12.994 --> 32:16.394
So what? Communism is
a corrupt system,

32:16.554 --> 32:18.434
everybody knows that.

32:21.074 --> 32:22.714
This is Lari Bogdan.

32:24.274 --> 32:28.074
Godeanu's former agent
who ran his smuggling ring.

32:28.234 --> 32:31.394
Godeanu had him killed
the moment Lari got caught.

32:34.434 --> 32:39.434
Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I know this game too well.

32:39.594 --> 32:43.514
Divide and conquer. You discredit him
so nobody believes what he says.

32:45.914 --> 32:47.554
All right then.

32:50.954 --> 32:54.674
Ask Victor about this man.

32:56.354 --> 33:02.274
His ex-partner and his friend.
Victor killed him personally.

33:02.434 --> 33:09.274
-Just ask him, see how he reacts.
-Guys, we know how your system works.

33:10.314 --> 33:12.554
I think this is all fictional.

33:14.794 --> 33:18.074
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have things to do.

33:20.874 --> 33:24.154
I bet he told you
the Candy Boy story.

33:27.434 --> 33:31.994
Let me guess, he gave you the version
with his father, didn't he?

33:33.834 --> 33:37.274
His father never worked
in a candy factory.

33:38.314 --> 33:40.074
His mother did.

33:41.594 --> 33:43.954
But Victor likes to change
the characters

33:44.114 --> 33:46.354
depending on the audience.

33:51.074 --> 33:55.354
You don't have to believe me,
I know I have a vested interest here.

33:55.514 --> 33:58.234
But if I were you,
I'd think about it for a second.

34:00.234 --> 34:03.794
What kind of man
would leave his family behind?

34:15.314 --> 34:19.074
What's going on? I need to know.

34:19.234 --> 34:23.714
Nothing's going on,
just a business opportunity.

34:23.874 --> 34:29.434
-You're no businessman.
-It's important. You should trust us.

34:29.594 --> 34:32.394
I trust Omar, not you.

34:32.554 --> 34:36.274
He's simple, you're smart.
You manipulate him.

34:36.434 --> 34:40.674
Don't blame me.
He can look after himself.

34:40.834 --> 34:45.714
Look, I know you're my brother,
and I do love you.

34:47.314 --> 34:49.714
But I'm scared.

34:49.874 --> 34:54.594
You disappear for months at a time,
now you suddenly show up.

34:54.754 --> 34:58.074
-I don't want trouble.
-Trouble?

34:58.234 --> 35:01.034
I wasn't trouble
when Omar and you needed me!

35:01.194 --> 35:04.794
-I helped you--
-You always want something in return!

35:04.954 --> 35:09.354
-If you mean our parents.
-Leave my family alone!

35:09.514 --> 35:13.034
-I am your family!
-You are my worst nightmare!

35:41.874 --> 35:45.234
Safiya, I thought
you took the day off.

35:45.394 --> 35:48.314
I have to talk to you.

35:48.474 --> 35:50.594
What happened to your cheek?

35:52.074 --> 35:53.554
Come in.

35:58.994 --> 36:00.554
Have a seat.

36:06.794 --> 36:09.354
What happened, did someone hit you?

36:11.914 --> 36:13.634
Talk to me.

36:17.994 --> 36:19.994
I can't.

36:37.314 --> 36:39.194
Talk to me.

36:40.794 --> 36:42.714
You can tell me anything.

36:44.634 --> 36:49.954
My husband Omar and my brother,
they're plotting something.

36:50.114 --> 36:52.274
They have weapons!

36:55.154 --> 36:58.074
I'm afraid someone's going to die.

37:06.394 --> 37:08.554
Why have you come to me?

37:11.154 --> 37:15.194
-Who sent you?
-No one.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.154
Who do you work for?
Who sent you, Safiya?

37:19.314 --> 37:20.954
No one!

37:24.474 --> 37:25.794
Hey.

37:29.394 --> 37:32.354
You are my only friend here.

37:34.074 --> 37:35.954
I need help.

37:37.154 --> 37:38.674
Please.

37:46.954 --> 37:52.874
Frank. Here it is.
Cheapest one I could find.

37:54.914 --> 37:59.314
Well, I guess he must
have pissed you off?

37:59.474 --> 38:02.674
Okay, well, I'm around
if you need anything--

38:03.794 --> 38:06.674
Comrade Ceaușescu's sicced
the Secret Police

38:06.834 --> 38:08.194
on Godeanu's family.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.154
Cleaning up everything.

38:11.874 --> 38:14.754
I have good news too. Listen to this.

38:15.874 --> 38:19.794
Well, I guess he must
have   pissed   you   off.

38:21.034 --> 38:24.434
Our chat with Jackson paid off.
There's trouble in paradise.

38:24.594 --> 38:28.954
This is our shot. Get your people.

39:11.554 --> 39:13.154
You don't like it?

39:15.114 --> 39:16.634
I like it.

39:25.874 --> 39:27.394
Do you mind?

39:41.914 --> 39:43.794
Do you love your daughter?

39:57.594 --> 40:01.874
-I don't understand the question.
-It's a simple question.

40:04.874 --> 40:07.514
Of course, I do, you know that.
Above everything.

40:07.674 --> 40:08.994
Yeah.

40:10.834 --> 40:15.794
How does a father who loves
his daughter above everything

40:15.954 --> 40:18.434
leave her behind like that?

40:19.714 --> 40:25.474
Knowing what will most likely happen
to her? How?

40:29.234 --> 40:31.354
It was my only chance.

40:32.554 --> 40:36.354
-I had to take it.
-See, I don't get it.

40:38.194 --> 40:41.114
You were in France
a few months ago with Ileana.

40:42.714 --> 40:45.274
You could have left then,
but you didn't.

40:46.554 --> 40:47.954
Why?

40:49.954 --> 40:51.554
Why now?

41:01.434 --> 41:03.674
I got a present today.

41:05.794 --> 41:08.234
Lots of fun photos.

41:09.874 --> 41:13.554
You know, Victor, the reason
you came to us fucking matters.

41:13.714 --> 41:16.634
Your motivation is crucial,
you know that.

41:16.794 --> 41:22.314
-They're trying to manipulate you.
-We'll see who is manipulating who.

41:26.314 --> 41:31.954
Tell me.
Did you abandon your only child

41:32.114 --> 41:34.514
just to save your crook ass?

41:34.674 --> 41:36.514
-I'd never do that.
-But you did!

41:39.874 --> 41:44.554
The fucking cat got your tongue?
Now is your chance, Victor!

41:44.714 --> 41:46.674
Tell the truth.

41:48.034 --> 41:51.954
I'm being investigated for a dozen
bottles of whisky and electronics.

41:52.114 --> 41:54.634
I was planning to reveal that
in Washington--

41:54.794 --> 41:58.194
I don't give a shit how much whisky
and fucking toasters you had

41:58.354 --> 42:02.434
in your goddamn basement.
I trusted you and you lied to me!

42:03.994 --> 42:07.314
You looked me straight in the eye
and you told me some bullshit

42:07.474 --> 42:09.994
on truth and fatherhood.

42:12.394 --> 42:14.194
Who are you, Victor?

42:38.074 --> 42:40.954
I hear he was your partner.

42:46.914 --> 42:50.114
So it's true. You killed him.

42:53.874 --> 42:58.394
-Yes. I tried to tell you--
-That you blew his brain out?

42:58.554 --> 43:00.594
-I'd remember.
-You have to understand.

43:00.754 --> 43:02.994
No, you have to understand!

43:03.154 --> 43:07.514
By hiding this from me, you risked
both your defection and my career.

43:07.674 --> 43:11.034
Why? I'm not worse
than any of the guys you worked

43:11.194 --> 43:13.834
in the name of the greater good,
and you know!

43:13.994 --> 43:16.914
You don't get it!

43:17.074 --> 43:20.274
It's not about murder,
it's about trust, Victor!

43:20.434 --> 43:24.714
We trust you, you're in.
We don't, you're out.

43:24.874 --> 43:27.634
I thought you were smarter than this.

43:31.194 --> 43:33.674
I was the only friend you had.

44:04.914 --> 44:09.994
I told you! They're here for us.
Stay here.

44:14.074 --> 44:19.634
-Ileana Godeanu? Come with us.
-Let go! Mum!

44:19.794 --> 44:26.034
-No! Mom!
-No, no, no! No!

44:29.474 --> 44:34.474
No, no! No!

46:02.714 --> 46:04.234
Hello?

46:06.474 --> 46:08.234
Is that you?

46:08.394 --> 46:13.034
-Are you okay?
- No. No, I'm not okay.

46:14.394 --> 46:16.274
This Carmen came to my place

46:16.434 --> 46:19.154
showed me a picture
of you and Shakarov.

46:19.314 --> 46:21.914
My cleaning lady's telling me
about an attack,

46:22.074 --> 46:25.594
-this can't be a coincidence.
-Slow down, what attack?

46:25.754 --> 46:29.394
I don't know what's going on,
but something big is happening,

46:29.554 --> 46:32.594
and I'm in the middle of it
and I don't know who to trust.

46:32.754 --> 46:34.594
You can trust me.

46:34.754 --> 46:37.274
That photo was doctored.
Carmen's out to get me.

46:37.434 --> 46:39.394
You can't believe a word she says.

46:39.554 --> 46:43.474
Ingrid, I can't have any trouble
in Bonn right now.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.194
Tell me about the attack.

46:45.354 --> 46:48.434
I can help you once I'm out,
I can get you somewhere safe.

46:48.594 --> 46:53.754
- I can help you hide.
-Hide, like you? No, thank you.

46:55.314 --> 47:00.754
-Ingrid, tell me what you know.
-I only have a name.

47:03.914 --> 47:09.474
Omar Fahim. He and Safiya's brother,
they're up to something.

47:10.754 --> 47:14.154
Take that to your American friends.
And don't call me again.

47:14.314 --> 47:16.754
No, Ingrid, wait. I know that name.

47:16.914 --> 47:20.114
You're right.
None of this is a coincidence.

47:21.514 --> 47:23.794
The BND know that you're a Stasi.

47:25.874 --> 47:30.754
-What?
-You have to run. Run now!
