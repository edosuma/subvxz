YEAH, BUT WHAT'S IT DOING
AT MAGIC SCHOOL?

00:18.975 --> 00:20.846
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS PLACE IS DEMON CENTRAL.

00:21.021 --> 00:25.112
AND IT'S
BEATING UP OTHER DEMONS.
THAT'S NOT WHAT KRYCHEKS DO.

00:25.286 --> 00:28.724
YEAH, BUT THEY ALSO
DON'T ATTACK GNOMES
AND LEPRECHAUNS,

00:28.898 --> 00:30.204
BUT THIS ONE DID.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.249
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.338
YEAH, WELL, WHAT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:34.512 --> 00:36.384
IS THAT WE ARE
TRACKING THIS THING.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.777

WANT WITH THIS DEMON ANYWAY?

00:38.951 --> 00:43.565

HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

01:06.414 --> 01:08.242
WHO CARES?
JUST VANQUISH IT.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.549
I ALREADY TRIED,
AND AGENT MURPHY WANTS US
TO BRING THE THING BACK.

FROM YOU TO SCHWARZENEGGER.

THE LAST TIME WE HAD
A WEEKEND TOGETHER ALONE?

I KNOW. AND I PROMISE
NOTHING IS GONNA STOP THAT
FROM HAPPENING. I PROMISE.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.896
BUT I JUST KIND OF NEED
TO TALK TO HIM FIRST.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.769
BUT WHY CAN'T
BILLIE TALK TO MURPHY?

04:07.943 --> 04:10.250

FIND BILLIE ANYWHERE.

HE WANTS YOU.

YOUR FACE TURNING RED?

04:30.095 --> 04:33.577

OF TURNING RED.

TO FIND OUT HOW HE TRANSFORMED,

WHY HE BECAME SO POWERFUL.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.286
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I'M GETTING USED TO IT.

12:12.601 --> 12:15.647
SO PAIGE THINKS

12:15.822 --> 12:16.910
THAT THE ONE

SO WHATEVER GOT HIM
ALL HULKED OUT,

12:18.607 --> 12:20.435

WHICH IS COOL.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.219
I MEAN, BAD COOL,
BUT STILL KIND OF COOL.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.569
SO NOW THERE'S TWO OF THEM
RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE?

12:24.744 --> 12:28.269
NO. ACTUALLY, I SAW YOURS

HE'S DEAD.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.662
OOH. MURPHY'LL BE
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

12:30.837 --> 12:34.666
BUT WHY ARE ALL THESE DEMONS
RUNNING AROUND ON STEROIDS?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

TO CHECK THE BOOKS SO YOU
CAN STILL GO ON YOUR TRIP?

12:58.647 --> 13:00.823
BECAUSE HE LIKES
TO SEE ME SQUIRM.

THE BABY'S MOM IS IN JAIL

TOLD US WHAT HAPPENED.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.636
I TALKED TO HER ABOUT IT,
BUT I CAN'T REALLY BLAME HER.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.117
SHE SAID THE DEMON
LOOKED LIKE A KRYCHEK.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
YEAH, ONLY IN SIZE
AND IN POWER.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.165
BILLIE SAID WHEN SHE
CONFRONTED HIM BEFORE,
HE WASN'T NEARLY AS BIG.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.645
DID YOU GET ANYTHING
OUT OF AGENT MURPHY?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.909
JUST THAT HE WANTS
THE DEMON BACK, WHICH
IS KIND OF DISTURBING.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.736
NOW THAT BILLIE
SAW HIM DIE,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.869
I DON'T REALLY THINK
IT'S OUR PROBLEM ANYMORE.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.524
I'D STILL LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT'S MAKING THEM
SO POWERFUL.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.526
WELL, I HAVE TO GET HENRY
TO TAKE THIS BABY
SOMEWHERE ELSE

13:51.700 --> 13:54.311

TAKE HIM WITH YOU, RIGHT?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.580
I CAN'T. SOCIAL SERVICES MIGHT
BE THERE WAITING TO TAKE HIM.

ATTACK THE KRYCHEK.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.562
THIS MORNING
THEIR NEW WITCH
ATTACKED EMRICK.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.652
BOTH DEMONS HAD
THE POWER YOU SEEK.

15:57.826 --> 16:01.438
WHICH MEANS THEY MUST BE
AFTER THE POWER AS WELL.

SHE NEEDS A THIRD SUITCASE.

NO. THERE'S NOTHING
IN THIS BOOK THAT SAYS
HOW TO SUPERCHARGE A DEMON.

ANCESTORS HAVE CONFRONTED
ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE.

OF THEIR EXPERIENCES.

FIND THE FATHER BEFORE

22:02.712 --> 22:04.540
WE KNOW WHY YOU CALLED.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.803
WERE YOU SPYING ON US AGAIN?

22:06.977 --> 22:09.153
NO. BUT WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO BILLIE.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.939
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
IS HAPPENING ALL OVER
THE MAGICAL COMMUNITY.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.941
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S CAUSING IT YET.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.073
IT SEEMS TO BE
SOME SORT OF A VIRUS,

22:16.247 --> 22:17.597
AND IT'S SPREADING FAST.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.642
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW IS THAT--

22:19.816 --> 22:23.820
POSSIBLE?
I'M AFRAID WHATEVER
THIS VIRUS IS, PIPER,

22:23.994 --> 22:25.561
WHEREVER IT CAME FROM,

22:25.735 --> 22:27.911
IT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST GOOD OR EVIL.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.218
IT CAN INFECT
ALL MAGICAL CREATURES,

22:30.392 --> 22:31.785
EVEN YOU AND YOUR SISTERS.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.395
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.615
WE HAVE TO FIND A CURE,
AN ANTIDOTE.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.531
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
WE HAVE TO FIND
THE SOURCE FIRST.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.794
HOW MUCH TIME
DOES BILLIE HAVE?

22:40.968 --> 22:43.623
NOT LONG,
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE LEARNED

22:43.797 --> 22:45.625
THAT THE MORE
POWERFUL YOU ARE,

22:45.799 --> 22:47.670
THE QUICKER
THE VIRUS CONSUMES YOU.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.811
HI. HEY.

22:57.985 --> 23:00.030
PAIGE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T BRING HIM HERE.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.728
NO, IT'S OK.
I FOUND HIS DAD.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.556
WHAT?
YEAH. ERNESTO.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.210
THERE. THAT'S GOT
HIS WORK NUMBER,
HIS HOME NUMBER,

23:06.385 --> 23:08.952
UH, PLACE WHERE HE LIKES
TO GO HAVE A DRINK.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.607
MIGHT WANNA TALK
TO HIM ABOUT THAT,
NEW DAD AND ALL.

23:11.781 --> 23:14.218
WHOA, WAIT, WAIT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.177
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR HIM EVERYWHERE.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.179
I HAVE MY WAYS.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.529
OH, REALLY.
DO YOU CARE TO ELABORATE?

23:20.703 --> 23:22.488
NO. NOT REALLY.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.534
LOOK, YOU WANTED THE BABY
TO HAVE A CHANCE,

23:25.708 --> 23:27.536
AND NOW HE HAS ONE.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.843
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.758
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.194
MY PLEASURE.
I GOT TO GO.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.891
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

23:35.065 --> 23:36.589
NO, NOT REALLY.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.026
A FRIEND OF MINE IS
IN QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.376
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.596
IT'S VERY SWEET
OF YOU, BUT NO.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.685
TAKE CARE
OF THE BABY, OK?

23:56.043 --> 23:57.218
PIPER!

23:57.392 --> 23:59.481
SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING TO BILLIE!

24:06.314 --> 24:07.663
OH, NO.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.839
"OH, NO"?
WHAT DOES "OH, NO" MEAN?

24:10.013 --> 24:11.841
WHAT DID THE ELDERS SAY?

24:12.015 --> 24:13.974
THEY THINK IT'S
SOME KIND OF VIRUS

24:14.148 --> 24:16.193
AND THAT SHE MUST
HAVE CONTRACTED IT
FROM THE SCRATCH.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.369
SO THE DEMON
GAVE THIS TO HER?

24:18.544 --> 24:21.155
IF WE DON'T FIND
AN ANTIDOTE SOON,

24:21.329 --> 24:23.592
SHE'LL DIE.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.552
WELL, NO. I MEAN,
WE CAN'T LET HER DIE.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.554
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.512
WE CAN'T JUST
DO NOTHING, PIPER.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.819
WELL, WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE IT ALL STARTED

24:32.993 --> 24:34.951
AND WHO IT
ALL STARTED FROM.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.215
PAIGE, WHERE ARE YOU?

24:38.389 --> 24:40.479
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

24:40.653 --> 24:43.046
UH, WE GOT TO GET
TO AGENT MURPHY,
SO I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.700
QUICK.

24:44.874 --> 24:45.788
[BILLIE MOANS]

24:51.751 --> 24:53.230
YOU CAN'T JUST...

24:55.102 --> 24:56.233
WHAT THE...

24:56.407 --> 24:58.018
LOCKS.

24:58.453 --> 25:00.281
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US
EVERYTHING,
AGENT MURPHY,

25:00.455 --> 25:01.804
AND WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.024
YOU NEED TO TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

25:04.198 --> 25:06.026
ABOUT THAT DEMON NOW.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.202
BUT I'VE TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.421
SEE, I DON'T LIKE
THAT ANSWER.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.992
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
THIS IS A FEDERAL OFFICE.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.779
LISTEN TO ME.
WHATEVER YOU GUYS DID TO
THAT DEMON CREATED A VIRUS,

25:19.953 --> 25:22.912
A VIRUS THAT CAN INFECT
EVERY MAGICAL CREATURE
THERE IS.

25:23.086 --> 25:26.786
IF WE DON'T FIND A CURE,
AND SOON, BILLIE WILL DIE.
DO YOU REMEMBER BILLIE?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.832
CUTE, BLONDE, PERKY.
YEAH. SHE'S GONNA DIE.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.226
SO WE WOULD LIKE
SOME ANSWERS, AND NOW.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.532
PAIGE.

25:33.706 --> 25:34.620
CHAIR.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.582
YOU'RE GONNA
TELL US HOW THIS
WHOLE THING STARTED,

25:40.756 --> 25:42.976
OR THE NEXT THING
I'M GONNA BLOW UP

25:43.150 --> 25:45.108
WILL BE YOU.

25:55.162 --> 25:58.905
I DID SOME DIGGING
AFTER YOU LEFT.

25:59.079 --> 26:02.735
LOOK...ALL RIGHT,
IF I WOULD'VE KNOWN,
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU,

26:02.909 --> 26:06.086
BUT I WASN'T CLEARED
FOR ALL THE DETAILS.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.220
THEY FOUND THE DEMON
IN THE DESERT?

26:10.394 --> 26:12.222
YEAH, BUT IT WAS A FLUKE.
HE WAS INJURED.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.485
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THE TASK FORCE WAS ABLE
TO CAPTURE IT.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.837
GOVERNMENT JUST WANTED
TO STUDY IT, LEARN FROM IT.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.100
I KEEP SEEING
THE WORD "INJECTED."

26:20.274 --> 26:22.015
WHAT DID THEY
INJECT HIM WITH?

26:22.189 --> 26:24.191
HUMAN BLOOD.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.323
THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO FIND A WAY TO COMBINE IT
WITH THE DEMON'S BLOOD

26:26.497 --> 26:27.673
TO EXTRACT ITS POWERS.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.196
POWERS? WHY?

26:29.370 --> 26:32.503
TO INJECT THE SERUM
BACK INTO PEOPLE.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.157
SOLDIERS.

26:34.331 --> 26:37.421
TO MAKE THEM
MORE POWERFUL?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.902
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
WHEN THE TEST SUBJECT
DIDN'T REACT,

26:40.076 --> 26:41.817
THE PROJECT WAS SHUT DOWN.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.906
APPARENTLY,
WHEN THEY WERE DECIDING
WHAT TO DO WITH THE DEMON

26:44.080 --> 26:46.126
THAT'S WHEN IT ESCAPED
FROM THE CONTAINMENT UNIT.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.258
SO NOW HE'S OUT THERE
SPREADING THE VIRUS
THAT YOU GUYS CREATED.

26:48.432 --> 26:51.348
YOU SAID THE TEST
SUBJECT DIDN'T SHOW
ANY SIDE EFFECTS.

26:51.522 --> 26:52.523
NO. NONE.

26:52.698 --> 26:53.742
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

26:53.916 --> 26:55.657
I'M THINKING
THE TEST SUBJECT'S BLOOD

26:55.831 --> 26:57.964
PROBABLY HOLDS THE ANTIDOTE
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.619
IF HE WAS IMMUNE
TO ITS EFFECTS...

27:00.793 --> 27:03.012
WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

27:03.186 --> 27:06.146
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS ONLY REFERRED
TO HERE AS "PATIENT X."

27:06.320 --> 27:08.714
LIKE I SAID, WHEN
THE EXPERIMENT WAS SHUT DOWN,

27:08.888 --> 27:10.541
ALL HIS RECORDS
WERE DESTROYED.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.632
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN USE TO FIND HIM.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.025
WELL, THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF

27:16.199 --> 27:18.332
IS THIS I.D. TAG
WE GOT HERE.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.335
BUT I ALREADY
SCANNED THE BAR CODE,

27:21.509 --> 27:23.990
AND ALL THE INFORMATION'S
ALREADY BEEN ERASED.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.209
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.268
THANKS.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.662
WOW. I MUST BE PRETTY BAD OFF

27:43.836 --> 27:46.665
IF YOU'RE WAITING
ON ME HAND AND FOOT.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.016
WELL, DON'T GET USED TO IT
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

27:50.190 --> 27:52.279
AM I?

27:54.803 --> 27:57.327
I'M DYING, AREN'T I?

27:57.501 --> 27:59.895
NO. YOU'RE NOT DYING.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.289
LISTEN. DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA

28:02.463 --> 28:05.945
HOW MANY TIMES
I HAVE ALMOST DIED
IN THE LAST 7 YEARS?

28:06.119 --> 28:07.511
IT'S A LOT.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.645
YEAH, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.343
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU.

28:13.517 --> 28:16.738
STOP IT. IT'S OK.
WE'RE GONNA SAVE YOU,

28:16.912 --> 28:19.828
AND WE'RE GONNA SAVE MAGIC
WHILE WE'RE AT IT.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.612
HOW CAN YOU SAVE MAGIC

28:21.787 --> 28:24.746
IF YOU DON'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN YOUR OWN ANYMORE?

28:26.530 --> 28:28.489
I HEARD YOU TALKING TO PIPER.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.189
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.583
I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOME MORE ICE.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.788
HOW'S BILLIE?

29:06.962 --> 29:08.572
NOT GOOD. WHAT'D
YOU GUYS FIND OUT?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.052
IT WAS A GOVERNMENT
SECRET EXPERIMENT.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.141
THEY MIXED THINGS
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

29:12.315 --> 29:15.841
BASICALLY, THEIR DEMON
WAS THE OUTBREAK MONKEY
THAT CAUSED ALL OF THIS.

29:16.015 --> 29:19.061
SO IF THEY MADE IT,
THEN THEY MUST HAVE
A CURE, RIGHT?

29:19.235 --> 29:21.890
WELL, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THEY CREATED IT.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.936
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
FOR SURE.

29:24.110 --> 29:26.112
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THIS COULD'VE BEEN
THEIR INTENTION.

29:26.286 --> 29:29.115
PHOEBE, IT'S NOT A CONSPIRACY.
THEY JUST SCREWED UP.

29:29.289 --> 29:32.205
WE HAD A SHOT AT AN ANTIDOTE,
AND THEY SCREWED THAT UP, TOO.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.381
WHAT SHOT?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.949
THEY INJECTED SOMEBODY
WITH KRYCHEK'S BLOOD
AND HAD NO EFFECT.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.778
THEN MAYBE THE CURE
IS IN THE BLOOD, RIGHT?

29:42.606 --> 29:44.957
OK, LOOK,
THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT,

29:45.131 --> 29:47.394
AND WHAT WE DON'T HAVE
IS ENOUGH TIME.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.570
WE GOT TO FIND THIS PATIENT X,

29:49.744 --> 29:52.573
CONVINCE HIM TO GIVE US
SOME OF HIS BLOOD SO THAT
WE CAN MAKE AN ANTIDOTE,

29:52.747 --> 29:54.488
FIX US AND THEN FIX BILLIE.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.230
EVEN IF WE POOL
ALL OF OUR POWERS TOGETHER,

29:57.404 --> 29:59.319
WE MAY NOT HAVE
ENOUGH TIME.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.322
THEN LET'S GET STRONGER.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.281
LET'S GET BILLIE
TO INFECT US.

30:05.455 --> 30:08.850
WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?
PHOEBE, WE COULD DIE.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.504
NOT IF WE FIND
THE ANTIDOTE FIRST.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.462
STILL, THERE'S
NO GUARANTEE IT'S GONNA WORK.

30:12.636 --> 30:13.986
IT'S VERY RISKY.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.904
YEAH. TELL THAT TO BILLIE.

30:19.078 --> 30:21.428
I DON'T SEE THE POINT
OF HAVING POWERS

30:21.602 --> 30:25.258
IF WE CAN'T USE THEM
TO SAVE SOMEONE
THAT WE CARE ABOUT.

30:34.528 --> 30:35.790
BILLIE?

30:37.966 --> 30:40.012
BILLIE. WAKE UP.

30:41.317 --> 30:42.884

A WAY TO SAVE YOU.

YOUR HELP.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.071
IT'S OK. TRUST US.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.251
NO. I KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY.

GONNA LAST?

31:27.450 --> 31:29.322
HOPEFULLY, LONG ENOUGH.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.807
I HAVEN'T FOUND
AN ANTIDOTE YET.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.984
THAT'S OK.

STOP IT. YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA KILL EACH OTHER.

WE MADE IT HAPPEN.

TO THE ANTIDOTE, TOO.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.393
HOW DID IT GO
WITH MURPHY?

34:51.567 --> 34:52.916
WELL, HE DECIDED

34:53.091 --> 34:54.353
WE WERE A LITTLE
TOO DIFFICULT
TO WORK WITH,

34:54.527 --> 34:55.876
SO I DON'T THINK

34:56.050 --> 34:57.573
WE'LL BE HEARING
FROM HIM AGAIN
ANYTIME SOON.

34:57.747 --> 34:58.835
HOW RUDE.

34:59.009 --> 35:01.186
WELL, IF YOU GUYS
WILL EXCUSE ME,

35:01.360 --> 35:03.231
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON
LITTLE RAMON.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.406
DON'T YOU MEAN HENRY?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.800
NO. I MEAN RAMON.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.497
KISS HIM FOR ME.HENRY?

35:08.671 --> 35:10.369
NO. RAMON.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.589
OH. OK.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.119
HE GOT TO YOU,
DIDN'T HE? THE BABY.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.470
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF SKI TRIP

35:24.644 --> 35:26.515
TO GET READY FOR?

35:26.689 --> 35:27.821
YEAH.

35:27.995 --> 35:29.127
YEAH.

35:37.396 --> 35:40.703
WHY DIDN'T TINA
TELL ME WE HAD A KID?

35:40.877 --> 35:42.183
TINA'S A LITTLE
MESSED UP RIGHT NOW, OK?

35:42.357 --> 35:43.750
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
BACK IN PRISON.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.795
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT,
BUT YOU DID.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.581
NOW YOUR SON RAMON
NEEDS YOU.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.191
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS, MAN.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.497
I KNOW YOU CAN, ERNESTO.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.455
[BABY COOING]

35:53.629 --> 35:56.980
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D BE
BETTER OFF WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.766
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE. IT'S YOU
OR THE STATE, BUDDY.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.594
ERNESTO, LOOK AT ME.

36:01.768 --> 36:04.597
TOO MANY SONS THAT GROW UP
WITHOUT THEIR DADS--

36:04.771 --> 36:07.034
THAT'S HOW YOU GOT WHERE YOU
WERE A WHILE BACK, RIGHT?

36:07.208 --> 36:09.036
NOW YOU GOT A CHANCE
TO BREAK THAT CYCLE.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.908
DO RIGHT BY HIM...
AND BY YOU.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.911
HOW DO I HOLD HIM?

36:16.391 --> 36:19.177
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
YOU JUST DO.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.875
CRADLE HIS HEAD THERE.
YOU GOT HIM?

36:22.049 --> 36:24.182
YEAH.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.231
HE KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE ME, DON'T HE?

36:30.405 --> 36:32.102
YEAH, HE DOES.

36:32.277 --> 36:35.628
AND I GOT YOU
SOME DIAPERS AND STUFF
JUST TO GET YOU STARTED.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.370
YOU GOT TO HEAT UP
THE MILK, TOO, RIGHT?
BUT NOT TOO HOT.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.634
CALL THE LADY
AT SOCIAL SERVICES IF
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.810
HERE YOU GO.
YOU GOT IT?

36:43.984 --> 36:46.595
AND I'LL COME BY LATER.
I'LL CHECK UP ON YOU.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.728
OK. THANKS, HENRY.

36:48.902 --> 36:51.165
DON'T THANK ME.
YOU CAN THANK
THE LADY WHO FOUND YOU.

36:51.339 --> 36:52.775
WHAT LADY?

36:52.949 --> 36:54.255
PAIGE MATTHEWS.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.127
BEAUTIFUL LADY,
GREAT SMILE, A LITTLE WACKY.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.521
SHE DIDN'T FIND YOU?

36:59.695 --> 37:00.870
NO.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.830
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
GET OUT OF HERE.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.832
DAD.
[RAMON FUSSING]

37:06.006 --> 37:07.921
TAKE CARE OF YOUR SON.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.966
OK.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.974
SO, UH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE, UH, BIG LUG

37:18.148 --> 37:19.976
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
A THING ABOUT BABIES?

37:20.150 --> 37:22.675
I GUESS I'M A QUICK STUDY.

37:22.849 --> 37:26.156
YOU SURE IT
WASN'T JUST AN EXCUSE
TO TALK TO ME AGAIN?

37:26.331 --> 37:29.072
I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE YOUR SECRETS,
SO I'LL HAVE MINE.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.205
FAIR ENOUGH.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.948
SO I'VE GOT A GREAT SMILE?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.689
YEAH. YOU DO.

37:52.748 --> 37:53.836
[GASPS]

37:54.010 --> 37:55.273
Kid: MOMMY, MOMMY!

37:55.447 --> 37:58.624
OH, HI! DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL?

37:58.798 --> 37:59.929
YES.
YEAH.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.931
DO YOU HAVE HOMEWORK?

38:16.555 --> 38:18.774
I KNEW YOU'D COME HERE
SOONER OR LATER.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.298
REALLY? HOW'S THAT?

38:20.472 --> 38:21.995
WELL, BECAUSE 6 YEARS AGO,

38:22.169 --> 38:25.259
I WAS YOU STANDING THERE
TALKING TO ME.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.479
WAIT. SO IF...

38:27.653 --> 38:30.308
YOU WERE ME, THEN WHO
WERE YOU TALKING TO?

38:30.482 --> 38:33.746
DON'T TRY
TO FIGURE IT OUT.
IT'LL HURT OUR HEAD.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.574
"OUR HEAD"?

38:35.748 --> 38:38.881
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
IS THAT YOU'RE HERE NOW
FOR A REASON

38:39.055 --> 38:40.318
AND TO FIND ANSWERS.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.320
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T GET ALL CRYPTIC WITH ME,

38:42.494 --> 38:44.017
NOT AFTER THE DAY
I'VE HAD TODAY.

38:44.191 --> 38:47.063
OH, I REMEMBER
THE DAY YOU HAD.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.501
IT'S THE DAY YOU LOST FAITH
IN YOUR PREMONITIONS

38:49.675 --> 38:51.459
BECAUSE OF ALL
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH

38:51.633 --> 38:53.461
AND ALL
YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.550
YOU WERE PROMISED
SOMETHING--

38:55.724 --> 38:58.205
SOMETHING THAT MEANS
THE WORLD TO YOU--

38:58.379 --> 39:01.208
AND YOU'RE AFRAID
YOU MIGHT NOT GET IT.

39:01.382 --> 39:02.601
WILL I?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.735
I'M LIVING PROOF
OF THAT,

39:06.909 --> 39:08.824
AND SO IS SHE.

39:22.838 --> 39:23.970
Leo: PIPER, PLEASE!

39:24.144 --> 39:25.275
Piper: OH, COME ON!

39:25.450 --> 39:28.583
WHAT'S ONE MORE
PAIR OF SHOES?

39:36.025 --> 39:38.419
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:38.593 --> 39:40.595
YEAH.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.771
NEVER BETTER.
