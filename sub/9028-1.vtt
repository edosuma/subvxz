WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:04.003
(waves gently roaring)

00:07.674 --> 00:10.510
(bats screeching)

00:19.819 --> 00:22.822
(metallic pounding)

00:32.866 --> 00:36.636
(ominous instrumental music)

00:41.041 --> 00:43.543
(baby crying)

00:45.412 --> 00:48.415
(liquid squishing)

00:55.622 --> 00:59.225
(eerie instrumental music)

02:55.008 --> 02:57.577
(burning hiss)

02:58.745 --> 03:02.248
(eerie instrumental music)

03:46.726 --> 03:49.262
(wooden tapping)

03:49.262 --> 03:52.865
(eerie instrumental music)

04:02.108 --> 04:04.177
(birds chirping)

04:04.177 --> 04:05.445
- [Old Man] Oh for
  heaven's sakes,

04:05.445 --> 04:07.347
where are they?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.315
- They're only an hour late.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.284
They probably got lost.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.419
These roads can be
  kind of confusing.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.288
- I don't operate this way.

04:15.288 --> 04:18.291
- It shouldn't be much
longer, Mr. Butterfield.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.192
- See?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.026
It's gonna rain.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.527
Okay look, 10 minutes,

04:21.527 --> 04:24.297
then you're taking me back
  to the airport in Rome.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.798
- Just be patient
  please, I promise

04:25.798 --> 04:27.800
we'll be in and out in no time.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.302
- What kind of a person

04:29.302 --> 04:32.338
schedules a meeting out here
 in the middle of nowhere?

04:32.338 --> 04:35.575
Seven miles and where
 Christ lost his shoes.

04:35.575 --> 04:36.509
- Well,

04:36.509 --> 04:38.645
Dr. Lorca's a little eccentric.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.214
But this was his last
  stop before he flies home.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.682
It was the only
 time he had to meet.

04:42.682 --> 04:43.916
- Yeah, well.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.152
Seems very nefarious to me.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.254
I will not be toyed with.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.557
(horn honking)

04:51.557 --> 04:53.226
- Look, there they are.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.160
- Well.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.630
(light suspenseful music)

05:04.270 --> 05:05.705
- [Cowboy] Howdy.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.576
(ominous instrumental music)

05:24.490 --> 05:27.393
- Absolutely spectacular.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.761
- You must be Dr. Lorca.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.230
I'm Caitlin McCollum,
 from the university.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.498
- Ms. McCollum.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.168
My, my.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.270
All this time I've been
speaking with you on the phone,

05:37.270 --> 05:39.305
I never realized I
 was connecting with

05:39.305 --> 05:41.107
such a classic beauty.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.176
So young, so nubile, so--

05:43.176 --> 05:46.045
- [Hooded Woman] Dead,
 if you don't back off.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.647
Get out of my way!

05:47.647 --> 05:49.549
- Where are my manners?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.719
This breathtaking creature

05:52.719 --> 05:55.922
is one of my more
 prized possessions.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.523
Please allow me to introduce,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.559
Ms. Lauraline Dane.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.227
- A.K.A., his fiancÃ©.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.664
- It's nice to meet you.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.467
- You got a bar in this dump?

06:07.467 --> 06:08.401
(clearing throat)

06:08.401 --> 06:09.235
- I'm sorry,

06:09.235 --> 06:10.303
this is Mr. Butterfield,

06:10.303 --> 06:12.038
from the Antiquities Foundation.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.674
He's an expert in carbon
dating antique toys.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.008
- How do you do?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.745
You look just like a
 little toy yourself,

06:18.745 --> 06:20.213
don't you, sweetie?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.548
- Well aren't you a charmer.

06:26.519 --> 06:27.954
- Hi.

06:27.954 --> 06:28.788
I'm David.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.158
- [Mr. Butterfield]
 Good evening.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.960
- This is my stepson.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.795
Stand up straight, kid.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.131
Don't embarrass your father.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.000
He's all yours, sweetie.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.470
(thunder rumbling)

06:44.470 --> 06:45.605
- Nice to meet you both.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.839
- How was your trip?

06:46.839 --> 06:49.442
- Can we just get
  to this, please?

06:49.442 --> 06:53.279
I want daddy to buy me
 a late dinner in Rome.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.514
- Mr. Butterfield
  came all the way

06:54.514 --> 06:56.849
from America to
 document the transfer.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.452
The owners of the estate
 are a little superstitious,

06:59.452 --> 07:01.053
and wanted me to make
  the transaction for them.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.756
But I thought since you
  agreed to pay their price,

07:03.756 --> 07:05.458
it would be in your
 best interest to

07:05.458 --> 07:08.661
make positive that the toy we
 found was really authentic.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.163
- How very kind of you.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.764
But, I can assure you that I'm

07:11.764 --> 07:14.367
well taken care of
 in that department.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.868
Caitlin,

07:15.868 --> 07:17.203
Mr. Butterfield,

07:18.404 --> 07:19.238
this...

07:20.273 --> 07:22.675
Is Ms. Lillith Demarque.

07:22.675 --> 07:23.843
- Good evening.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.445
- [Mr. Butterfield]
 How do you do?

07:28.714 --> 07:30.650
- It's nice to meet
 you, I'm Caitlin.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.884
- I met Ms. Demarque

07:31.884 --> 07:34.020
on a trip to Paris
 last year, while I was

07:34.020 --> 07:36.055
collecting a mummified hand,

07:36.055 --> 07:39.158
excavated from the tombs
beneath Notre Dame.

07:39.158 --> 07:40.393
It was she who confirmed

07:40.393 --> 07:43.563
that the hand belonged
 to Napoleon himself.

07:43.563 --> 07:44.530
- So you're,

07:44.530 --> 07:45.965
an archaeologist?

07:46.866 --> 07:48.601
- An indigo child.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.603
One blessed with the ability to

07:50.603 --> 07:52.405
see into the unknown.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.106
All it takes...

07:54.106 --> 07:55.007
Is a touch.

07:56.742 --> 07:57.610
- Pleased

07:57.610 --> 07:58.611
to meet you.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.915
- [Cowboy] Oh, horse shit!

08:02.915 --> 08:04.917
- Be careful, you idiot!

08:06.118 --> 08:08.721
- I'm sorry Dr. Lorca, I
got it sir, don't worry!

08:08.721 --> 08:10.223
- The items in that
 trunk are worth more

08:10.223 --> 08:12.758
than a moron like you
 could earn in 20 lifetimes!

08:12.758 --> 08:15.061
Now pick them up and
 bring them all inside.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.395
- Yes sir!

08:16.395 --> 08:18.931
(thunder rumbling)

08:18.931 --> 08:20.466
- I don't understand.

08:20.466 --> 08:23.636
Why are you unloading
 all your stuff?

08:23.636 --> 08:25.738
- My dear Miss. McCollum.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.440
For the last six
months, I have traveled

08:27.440 --> 08:29.208
the darkest recesses
 of the world

08:29.208 --> 08:32.144
to complete my
collection of oddities.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.578
- He ain't kidding about that.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.847
- Many of these
 pieces are priceless.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.818
And mustn't be left alone
  for even an instant.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.086
- I don't think we'll
 be here long enough

08:40.086 --> 08:43.990
for you to have to
worry about any of that.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.359
- If you only knew
 the lengths to which

08:46.359 --> 08:48.294
my rivals have gone to

08:48.294 --> 08:50.196
outdo me in the past...

08:52.031 --> 08:54.734
You would certainly be
  as careful and meticulous

08:54.734 --> 08:57.837
as I, to ensure their security.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.238
- I understand.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.406
- Now.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.174
If you would please
 be so kind to

09:02.174 --> 09:03.876
take me inside,

09:03.876 --> 09:07.813
so that I can view
 your remarkable find.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.650
(wooden creaking)

09:16.289 --> 09:20.026
(ominous instrumental music)

09:26.332 --> 09:29.335
An absolutely
 spectacular structure!

09:30.603 --> 09:32.838
- It was built in
  the 13th Century.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.373
The locals say the
  castle sits on the

09:34.373 --> 09:36.375
Ancient Temple of Jupiter.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.977
Once ruled by an empress

09:37.977 --> 09:40.146
who used to practice
 black magic.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.781
- That's her?

09:41.781 --> 09:43.716
- Madame Fiora Borisov.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.418
She's the one who
 had this place built.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.852
She was a Bulgarian empress who

09:46.852 --> 09:49.555
fled her own country
  after her people revolted.

09:49.555 --> 09:51.023
Since then, the place
 has been home to

09:51.023 --> 09:52.725
a lot of Italian royalty,

09:52.725 --> 09:55.227
and also a few murderous madmen.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.563
- [Lauraline] You'd make
one hell of a realtor.

09:57.563 --> 09:58.397
So,

09:59.298 --> 10:00.933
where is everybody?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.668
- The current owners
 seldom come here.

10:02.668 --> 10:03.903
They're a little
 superstitious about

10:03.903 --> 10:06.272
everything that's gone
 down over the years.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.673
- Meaning?

10:07.673 --> 10:08.975
- It's nothing.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.143
Anyway, they've
 recently decided to

10:11.143 --> 10:13.913
empty it and sell it to
the Italian government.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.182
They're gonna sanction it
  as a historical landmark

10:16.182 --> 10:18.484
and keep it open to the public.

10:18.484 --> 10:19.752
- This place...

10:21.020 --> 10:22.955
Is far from empty.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.292
(ominous instrumental music)

10:26.292 --> 10:28.894
- Take me to the piece.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.964
(eerie instrumental music)

10:31.964 --> 10:34.967
(echoing footsteps)

10:51.550 --> 10:55.287
(ominous instrumental music)

11:03.629 --> 11:06.565
(thunder rumbling)

11:11.804 --> 11:15.975
- How much could a piece of
 junk like you be worth anyway?

11:18.377 --> 11:21.514
(eerie music box melody)

11:21.514 --> 11:22.415
Peek a boo!

11:23.749 --> 11:26.819
Come out, come out,
 wherever you are.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.655
(ominous instrumental music)

11:29.655 --> 11:30.489
Hello?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.195
Piece of junk!

11:37.196 --> 11:40.966
(ominous instrumental music)

11:42.668 --> 11:46.272
(eerie instrumental music)

11:48.507 --> 11:49.775
- [Caitlin] (mumbles) painted

11:49.775 --> 11:51.811
somewhere around
  the 16th Century.

11:51.811 --> 11:52.645
- [Dr. Lorca] Exquisite.

11:52.645 --> 11:53.946
- [Lauraline] Baby.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.715
Do we even (mumbles) like this?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.284
- [Caitlin] Rumor has it,
  if you look close enough,

11:58.284 --> 12:00.886
you can find hidden demons
  painted in the background.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.455
The artist said the
 demons represent

12:02.455 --> 12:05.324
the personal demons that
used to haunt Fiora.

12:05.324 --> 12:07.526
- Oh please, spare me
 the history lesson.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.428
Let's get to cracking.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.730
I got someplace I have to be.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.900
- Right up here
  in the main hall.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.036
- I bet this place would be
 a lot of fun on Halloween.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.537
- I'm fascinated by it.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.106
I mean, it's my life right now.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.707
There are hundreds
 of years of history

12:21.707 --> 12:24.043
just waiting to be
  discovered here.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.811
Nobody understands or
 respects this place

12:25.811 --> 12:26.979
like I do.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.147
- I guess that's

12:28.147 --> 12:29.115
probably why they're
 entrusting you

12:29.115 --> 12:30.649
to excavate for them.

12:30.649 --> 12:31.951
- [Caitlin] I guess.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.587
- I'm sorry for
 saying so, kitten, but

12:34.587 --> 12:35.821
aren't you a little young to be

12:35.821 --> 12:38.190
handling all of
  this on your own?

12:38.190 --> 12:39.391
- Actually, Ms. Dane,

12:39.391 --> 12:40.559
I have a Master's Degree in

12:40.559 --> 12:42.294
Ancient Roman
 Artifacts and Lore.

12:42.294 --> 12:43.829
I speak eight languages, and I

12:43.829 --> 12:46.065
graduated at the
  head of my class.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.167
- Sounds qualified to me.

12:50.569 --> 12:51.470
- Shall we?

12:52.771 --> 12:56.275
(light suspenseful music)

13:00.079 --> 13:01.814
We found him in
  the dungeon area.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.082
He was buried

13:03.082 --> 13:04.250
in a larger stone
  container that was

13:04.250 --> 13:06.585
lined with ornamental
 mosaic tiles.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.687
The case has elements
 of hand-pounded steels

13:08.687 --> 13:10.556
and copper and
  magnetic fixtures.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.224
- Open it.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.392
- [Caitlin] The piece itself,

13:13.392 --> 13:15.127
appears to be
 hand-carved of wood

13:15.127 --> 13:16.562
with some fabric elements.

13:16.562 --> 13:17.396
- I said,

13:17.396 --> 13:18.797
open it!

13:18.797 --> 13:21.133
(light suspenseful music)

13:21.133 --> 13:23.135
- Everybody...

13:23.135 --> 13:23.969
This...

13:24.870 --> 13:25.704
Is...

13:26.772 --> 13:27.606
Divoletto.

13:28.607 --> 13:31.410
(light suspenseful music)

13:31.410 --> 13:32.678
- It's hideous!

13:33.746 --> 13:35.181
- It's beautiful!

13:36.415 --> 13:39.051
- And the real deal, alright.

13:39.051 --> 13:41.053
Let's take a look at it.

13:41.053 --> 13:44.824
(ominous instrumental music)

13:44.824 --> 13:47.159
This is the oldest toy,

13:47.159 --> 13:49.829
I think I've ever seen.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.666
It was put together sometime
 around the 14th Century.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.834
I think, it...

13:56.468 --> 13:58.637
Where did you say
  you found this?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.206
- He was buried
 under some stonework

14:00.206 --> 14:02.641
in the dungeon floor.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.244
- He's in remarkable condition.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.112
- And...

14:08.147 --> 14:09.481
The movement?

14:09.481 --> 14:10.716
- Right.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.051
Well.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.788
(ominous instrumental music)

14:15.788 --> 14:17.022
You take this wand,

14:17.022 --> 14:18.824
and you tap it on
 the side of the box.

14:18.824 --> 14:19.658
Like this.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.328
(hollow wooden tapping)

14:22.328 --> 14:26.432
(suspenseful instrumental music)

14:31.103 --> 14:33.372
- Please, allow me.

14:33.372 --> 14:37.710
(suspenseful instrumental music)

14:37.710 --> 14:41.046
(hollow wooden tapping)

14:42.348 --> 14:44.750
- Sometimes it takes a while.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.656
(hollow wooden tapping)

14:50.656 --> 14:52.324
- Divoletto!

14:52.324 --> 14:53.692
Move for me.

14:53.692 --> 14:57.496
(suspenseful instrumental music)

14:57.496 --> 14:58.931
Move!

14:58.931 --> 15:02.835
(suspenseful instrumental music)

15:02.835 --> 15:03.802
- Figures.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.738
Master's Degree my ass.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.773
I knew she was a fake!

15:07.773 --> 15:09.074
What kind of scam are you

15:09.074 --> 15:11.543
running here anyway, honey?

15:11.543 --> 15:12.511
(high-pitched scream)

15:12.511 --> 15:13.779
- Silence!

15:13.779 --> 15:16.615
(wooden rattling)

15:21.553 --> 15:23.789
(laughter)

15:28.060 --> 15:28.961
Astounding!

15:34.667 --> 15:35.834
- But...

15:35.834 --> 15:37.670
But how did it do that?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.673
- We think there are springs
 and mechanisms inside him

15:40.673 --> 15:44.076
that are somehow set off
by magnets in the wand.

15:44.076 --> 15:44.943
- No.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.712
- Dr. Lorca!

15:46.712 --> 15:48.814
The cars are gone!

15:48.814 --> 15:50.282
- [Caitlin] Where are they?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.450
- [Cowboy] I came out to
 get the last of the crates,

15:51.450 --> 15:52.718
saw them both speeding
 up the driveway!

15:52.718 --> 15:54.219
- Are you telling me
 we've been carjacked

15:54.219 --> 15:55.387
by Italian villagers?

15:55.387 --> 15:56.455
- This can't be possible.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.656
- Really?

15:57.656 --> 15:58.857
Well where the
  hell are our cars?

15:58.857 --> 16:00.259
- Ms. Dane,

16:00.259 --> 16:02.194
I promise we'll find a
 logical explanation for this.

16:02.194 --> 16:03.862
(thunder rumbling)

16:03.862 --> 16:06.732
- Alright, follow me,
 I'll show you myself.

16:06.732 --> 16:10.836
(suspenseful instrumental music)

16:16.108 --> 16:18.510
- Good evening my
  little friends.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.313
Happy to see someone a
 little more your size?

16:21.313 --> 16:22.147
Hm?

16:24.283 --> 16:27.353
I bet it's nice to get a
little bit of fresh air.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.922
I can feel your energy.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.192
There's something more
 that motivates you.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.193
Isn't there?

16:35.127 --> 16:39.198
(suspenseful instrumental music)

16:42.101 --> 16:43.669
(low growling)

16:43.669 --> 16:46.605
(shrill screaming)

16:46.605 --> 16:49.708
(distorted shouting)

17:02.688 --> 17:05.022
(gasping)

17:05.022 --> 17:09.094
(suspenseful instrumental music)

17:11.163 --> 17:14.266
(pounding footsteps)

17:15.534 --> 17:17.035
- [Mr. Butterfield] So the cars

17:17.035 --> 17:18.604
are gone?

17:18.604 --> 17:20.105
- I don't know.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.941
But boy, they were getting
  out of here in a hurry!

17:22.941 --> 17:25.042
- Where is the rest
 of my collection?

17:25.042 --> 17:26.178
- I managed to get
  everything inside

17:26.178 --> 17:27.679
before they got the crates.

17:27.679 --> 17:28.981
- Well what are we gonna do?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.482
- We must phone the authorities,

17:30.482 --> 17:32.284
maybe they can catch them
  before they get too far!

17:32.284 --> 17:33.652
- I'll call the rental place,

17:33.652 --> 17:34.887
and tell them what happened.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.155
Maybe they can get us
 a car here tonight.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.990
- I'm afraid your not
 gonna have much luck.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.025
It's late, everything's
closed around here.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.427
- Well, what are we going to do?

17:41.427 --> 17:42.528
Walk to Rome?

17:44.963 --> 17:46.432
- We could spend the night here.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.933
I'll call the rental
 place first thing

17:47.933 --> 17:51.303
in the morning, you still
  might make your flight.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.671
- That's very...

17:52.671 --> 17:55.240
Generous of you, Ms. McCollum.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.475
We will...

17:56.475 --> 17:58.410
Accept your kind offer.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.014
In the meantime, I
 would ask that you and

18:02.014 --> 18:04.483
Mr. Butterfield draw
 up the documentation

18:04.483 --> 18:05.951
so that...

18:05.951 --> 18:09.221
I can make Divoletto
 part of my collection.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.322
- Absolutely.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.358
(sobbing)

18:16.829 --> 18:19.665
(wooden creaking)

18:22.201 --> 18:25.971
(ominous instrumental music)

18:38.684 --> 18:41.587
(thunder rumbling)

18:43.856 --> 18:47.626
(ominous instrumental music)

18:52.197 --> 18:54.566
- A suite fit for a queen.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.467
- Whatever.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.903
- For you,

18:57.903 --> 18:58.937
my beautiful queen.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.806
- Oh, slow down, daddy!

19:02.007 --> 19:03.909
We got company.

19:03.909 --> 19:06.011
- What is it now, you Cretan?

19:06.011 --> 19:07.279
- Sorry to interrupt.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.648
Ms. Dane asked me
 to bring up her bag.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.350
- Put it over there.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.520
Hang everything up
 while you're at it.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.894
(eerie music box melody)

19:21.894 --> 19:23.896
(wooden creaking)

19:23.896 --> 19:27.166
(mischievous growling)

19:29.668 --> 19:32.404
(spoken Italian)

19:33.305 --> 19:36.141
(wooden rattling)

19:39.745 --> 19:42.514
(eerie laughter)

19:49.354 --> 19:52.524
(pattering footsteps)

19:54.359 --> 19:57.095
(eerie laughter)

19:59.831 --> 20:02.601
(fire crackling)

20:13.946 --> 20:15.914
- See anything you like?

20:15.914 --> 20:19.484
Do you like how baby
 spent daddy's money?

20:19.484 --> 20:20.319
Mi amo!

20:24.523 --> 20:25.824
Baby?

20:25.824 --> 20:27.125
Do you think you could find us

20:27.125 --> 20:29.628
something to drink
  in this place?

20:29.628 --> 20:33.465
Daddy's little girl's
 getting real thirsty.

20:33.465 --> 20:34.900
- Oh, is she now?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.502
What do you say,

20:37.502 --> 20:40.439
I close my deal
  with Ms. McCollum,

20:40.439 --> 20:42.941
then dig up an old
  bottle of wine?

20:42.941 --> 20:43.809
- Oh!

20:43.809 --> 20:45.377
I'll drink to that.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.981
- We need to toast to
 the latest addition

20:48.981 --> 20:50.148
to our family.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.516
- Who?

20:51.516 --> 20:53.518
- Divoletto, of course.

20:53.518 --> 20:54.586
- Oh!

20:54.586 --> 20:55.420
Daddy!

20:56.822 --> 20:58.991
(moaning)

21:04.596 --> 21:06.765
(panting)

21:09.334 --> 21:12.504
(pattering footsteps)

21:14.773 --> 21:17.009
(shouting)

21:19.077 --> 21:21.847
(eerie laughter)

21:30.722 --> 21:34.326
(ominous instrumental music)

21:34.326 --> 21:36.261
(shouting)

21:36.261 --> 21:39.998
(ominous instrumental music)

21:45.837 --> 21:48.507
(mischievous laughter)

21:48.507 --> 21:52.511
(mysterious instrumental music)

21:54.546 --> 21:57.282
(eerie whispers)

22:01.553 --> 22:03.955
(screeching)

22:15.033 --> 22:18.937
(eerie music box melody)

22:18.937 --> 22:21.340
(screeching)

22:23.742 --> 22:27.012
(mischievous laughter)

22:32.017 --> 22:33.819
What do you say, I take a bath

22:33.819 --> 22:36.888
while you go find
 that bottle of wine,

22:36.888 --> 22:39.691
and meet me back
 here in 20 minutes?

22:39.691 --> 22:41.593
- I'll be back...

22:41.593 --> 22:42.761
Before you know it.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.596
- Oh, I know you will.

22:45.464 --> 22:48.200
(fire crackling)

22:50.635 --> 22:54.139
(light suspenseful music)

22:55.140 --> 22:58.310
(frustrated shout)

22:58.310 --> 23:00.879
I cannot even begin to tell you,

23:00.879 --> 23:03.715
how much kissing
 that man disgusts me!

23:03.715 --> 23:04.983
- Why's that?

23:04.983 --> 23:06.551
- Because.

23:06.551 --> 23:07.919
Why in the world
would someone as

23:07.919 --> 23:10.188
incredible as me need that

23:10.188 --> 23:12.023
old bag of bones?

23:12.023 --> 23:14.960
When I have myself
  a rough and tumble

23:14.960 --> 23:17.028
cowboy like you to take care of

23:17.028 --> 23:19.264
all my womanly needs?

23:19.264 --> 23:20.532
- Glad to be of service.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.701
(moaning)

23:26.204 --> 23:28.440
- Where'd you put the cars?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.242
- Down the road in
 the front of the bar.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.043
Left the keys in the ignition.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.445
Doors unlocked,
 just like you said.

23:33.445 --> 23:34.279
- Oh!

23:34.279 --> 23:35.113
Good boy!

23:36.414 --> 23:38.083
They'll think a
 couple of Italian kids

23:38.083 --> 23:40.018
decided to take a joyride.

23:40.018 --> 23:42.487
Did you bring the doll?

23:42.487 --> 23:46.558
(suspenseful instrumental music)

23:50.162 --> 23:52.097
- Does he look like
 the real thing?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.331
- He's perfect!

23:54.499 --> 23:56.501
I'll keep old scar
  face busy while

23:56.501 --> 23:58.904
you go switch the dolls.

23:58.904 --> 24:01.139
Tomorrow morning, we'll
  ditch them at the airport

24:01.139 --> 24:03.074
and fly back to France.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.110
- Where we'll sell
  the real doll.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.146
Get rich and disappear forever.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.816
- Who says pretty boys are dumb?

24:12.651 --> 24:15.554
(thunder rumbling)

24:20.859 --> 24:24.262
(eerie music box melody)

24:26.832 --> 24:30.068
(mischievous laughter)

24:31.536 --> 24:34.206
- Rise and shine, shithead!

24:34.206 --> 24:36.575
(mischievous laughter)

24:36.575 --> 24:37.409
Here's

24:38.977 --> 24:39.811
Jackie!

24:41.046 --> 24:42.480
Good job, guido.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.382
I don't know where the
 hell you came from,

24:44.382 --> 24:45.750
but just remember,

24:45.750 --> 24:46.751
I'm in charge,

24:46.751 --> 24:48.186
and you won't get hurt.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.421
You heard me.

24:49.421 --> 24:53.258
Now let's get back
 to kicking some ass!

24:53.258 --> 24:56.628
- Thanks for letting
 us stay here tonight.

24:56.628 --> 24:57.896
It's not every night
 a guy gets invited

24:57.896 --> 25:00.131
to sleep in a big
  castle like this.

25:00.131 --> 25:01.867
- Come on, you've seen
more interesting places

25:01.867 --> 25:04.469
on this trip with
  your stepfather.

25:04.469 --> 25:05.737
- Actually...

25:05.737 --> 25:07.772
He's not my stepfather.

25:07.772 --> 25:08.974
My dad was married to Lauraline

25:08.974 --> 25:11.877
just before he passed away.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.513
His will stipulated
that she got everything.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.848
Including yours truly, so...

25:16.848 --> 25:17.682
Here I am.

25:19.551 --> 25:20.886
- What happened?

25:22.354 --> 25:23.188
- Well nobody really knows,

25:23.188 --> 25:25.290
it was an accident.

25:25.290 --> 25:28.326
Anyway, my real mother
 left years ago, and

25:28.326 --> 25:29.694
I didn't have any other family

25:29.694 --> 25:31.429
so I stayed with them.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.098
- I'm sorry to hear that.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.367
- Not as sorry as I was.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.401
But I just graduated,

25:36.401 --> 25:37.869
that's the good news, and

25:37.869 --> 25:39.037
when I get back I'm
 gonna go out and

25:39.037 --> 25:40.906
get my own life.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.140
I just thought this
 trip was too good of

25:42.140 --> 25:43.675
an opportunity to

25:43.675 --> 25:45.644
see the world.

25:45.644 --> 25:46.978
Meet new people.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.014
Like you.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.651
- Well, thank you very much.

25:52.651 --> 25:55.020
- You're welcome very much.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.154
- So, um...

25:56.154 --> 25:58.857
Can I ask you something?

25:58.857 --> 26:00.292
- Sure.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.995
- What's that scar on
the doctor's face from?

26:05.163 --> 26:07.098
- I don't really
  know the details.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.366
But, from what I heard,

26:08.366 --> 26:11.369
he was in a scuffle with
one of his competitors.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.837
And he came out
  looking like that.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.640
Most of his body is
  scarred pretty bad, there.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.142
- That's terrible.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.378
(metallic slam)

26:20.378 --> 26:21.546
- Hello?

26:21.546 --> 26:23.782
(mischievous laughter)

26:23.782 --> 26:24.616
- [Voiceover] Shut up!

26:24.616 --> 26:25.617
Shut the fuck up!

26:25.617 --> 26:26.952
- Lauraline?

26:26.952 --> 26:31.056
(suspenseful instrumental music)

26:32.324 --> 26:33.725
(scream)

26:33.725 --> 26:36.061
- (mumbles)

26:37.228 --> 26:39.631
Is there any heat
  in this castle?

26:39.631 --> 26:41.466
Because I am freezing.

26:42.467 --> 26:43.969
This is torture!

26:43.969 --> 26:47.639
(thunder rumbling)

26:47.639 --> 26:50.909
(mischievous laughter)

26:51.910 --> 26:53.945
- [Baby Doll] Shut up!

26:53.945 --> 26:54.779
Come on!

26:59.651 --> 27:03.321
(ominous instrumental music)

27:06.291 --> 27:07.125
Shh!

27:08.560 --> 27:11.062
Walk on your tippy
  toes, fuck face!

27:11.062 --> 27:12.464
Get the lead out!

27:14.699 --> 27:18.103
(door creaking)

27:18.103 --> 27:20.939
(light suspenseful music)

27:20.939 --> 27:21.773
- Dr. Lorca.

27:21.773 --> 27:22.607
- Oh.

27:22.607 --> 27:24.275
There you are, my dear.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.977
There's been a
 problem with the cars,

27:25.977 --> 27:27.479
we'll be spending the night.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.313
- Perfect.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.716
I wanna hold a seance.

27:31.716 --> 27:32.684
While you were out,

27:32.684 --> 27:34.052
I got a read on the doll.

27:34.052 --> 27:35.720
It's not just any toy.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.757
It's got an energy like
anything I've ever seen.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.992
This whole place is
 filled with energy.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.294
- It seems to me,
 there may be more here

27:43.294 --> 27:46.064
than the girl is letting on.

27:46.064 --> 27:47.565
- Without a doubt.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.471
Tell everyone to meet me in
 the main hall at midnight.

27:53.471 --> 27:54.973
Dr. Lorca?

27:54.973 --> 27:55.807
- Yes?

27:57.275 --> 27:58.343
- Be careful!

27:59.644 --> 28:02.947
(suspenseful instrumental music)

28:02.947 --> 28:07.118
(mischievous laughter
 and screaming)

28:10.088 --> 28:12.757
(thunder claps)

28:14.626 --> 28:18.697
(suspenseful instrumental music)

28:29.040 --> 28:31.409
- Hello there you little devil.

28:31.409 --> 28:34.612
I've got someone I'd
 like you to meet.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.284
Look familiar?

28:39.284 --> 28:42.587
Just like looking in a mirror.

28:42.587 --> 28:46.658
(suspenseful instrumental music)

28:50.462 --> 28:52.464
Comfy, my little friend?

28:55.867 --> 28:58.036
(pattering footsteps)

28:58.036 --> 29:00.738
(glass shatters)

29:01.706 --> 29:03.208
- Hey!

29:03.208 --> 29:05.176
(mischievous laughter)

29:05.176 --> 29:06.511
- What the fuck?

29:07.712 --> 29:11.349
(mischievous laughter)

29:11.349 --> 29:12.617
Let me out of here!

29:12.617 --> 29:15.453
(wooden pounding)

29:18.022 --> 29:19.457
Stay away!

29:19.457 --> 29:21.159
(ominous instrumental music)

29:21.159 --> 29:23.928
(mischievous laughter)

29:23.928 --> 29:26.164
- [Baby Doll] Knock knock!

29:26.164 --> 29:27.398
If you wanna get out,

29:27.398 --> 29:28.800
you gotta answer!

29:30.735 --> 29:31.803
Knock knock.

29:31.803 --> 29:32.637
- Who's there?

29:32.637 --> 29:33.972
- [Baby Doll] Orange.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.208
I said orange!

29:37.208 --> 29:38.143
- Orange who?

29:38.143 --> 29:39.344
- Aren't you sorry that

29:39.344 --> 29:42.447
dumb bitch made you
pull the old switcheroo?

29:42.447 --> 29:43.281
(yelling)

29:43.281 --> 29:44.582
Whoopsie!

29:44.582 --> 29:46.317
Now he's got an owie!

29:48.486 --> 29:51.322
(echoing screams)

29:57.295 --> 30:01.399
(suspenseful instrumental music)

30:03.501 --> 30:05.770
(groaning)

30:07.205 --> 30:08.540
- What was that?

30:11.709 --> 30:13.044
- That was Eric.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.513
He's sleeping with
  my stepmother.

30:15.513 --> 30:18.082
They think that I don't know.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.652
- Some girls have all the luck.

30:22.120 --> 30:26.224
(shouting and maniacal laughter)

30:28.293 --> 30:31.229
(liquid squishing)

30:34.933 --> 30:37.936
(maniacal cackling)

30:40.138 --> 30:41.706
- [Baby Doll] Come on, boys.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.208
Hey, let's drag
  this piece of shit

30:43.208 --> 30:44.876
into the other room
 and play a little game

30:44.876 --> 30:46.878
of amateur footsie shot.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.915
(maniacal laughter)

30:54.385 --> 30:55.687
- So.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.855
Are you guys interested
in going on a tour?

30:57.855 --> 30:59.857
Some pretty interesting
  things to see around here.

30:59.857 --> 31:02.794
- [David] I thought
 you'd never ask.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.836
- [Caitlin] Mr. Butterfield?

31:14.739 --> 31:17.976
(thunder clapping)

31:17.976 --> 31:21.746
(ominous instrumental music)

31:30.488 --> 31:34.058
(wooden creaking)

31:34.058 --> 31:35.727
- Hello Divoletto.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.861
How would you like to join me

31:36.861 --> 31:38.663
at the seance tonight?

31:38.663 --> 31:41.599
(thunder rumbling)

31:54.279 --> 31:56.881
(wind howling)

31:58.116 --> 31:59.317
(ominous instrumental music)

31:59.317 --> 32:00.685
- Those stairs
 lead to the armory,

32:00.685 --> 32:02.754
which is my favorite
 room in the castle.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.690
- [Mr. Butterfield]
 Smells like cat piss.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.091
- [David] Where did
 they find this guy?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.993
- [Caitlin] I have no idea.

32:08.993 --> 32:10.862
- So how'd you get
  connected with this place?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.597
They contacted me
 through my professors

32:12.597 --> 32:14.365
at the university.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.134
I was at the top of my class,

32:16.134 --> 32:18.136
and I minored in Latin.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.371
Which has come in pretty
 handy around here, I guess.

32:20.371 --> 32:21.439
- Wow.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.574
You must be pretty smart.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.009
- Maybe a little.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.445
Oh, check this out.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.782
- "Oh, check this out!"

32:30.782 --> 32:32.216
I'm cold!

32:32.216 --> 32:33.151
I'm hungry!

32:34.018 --> 32:34.952
Shit!

32:34.952 --> 32:35.787
- This,

32:35.787 --> 32:37.388
is the physician's room.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.091
(ominous instrumental music)

32:40.091 --> 32:42.527
- [Mr. Butterfield] More
like a torture chamber.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.028
- [Caitlin] Well back then,
 they were more focused

32:44.028 --> 32:46.364
on curing the soul,
 than the body.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.032
They thought the more
 you tortured someone,

32:48.032 --> 32:51.202
the more the bad part of
  their soul would go away.

32:51.202 --> 32:52.203
- And...

32:52.203 --> 32:53.805
This lovely contraption?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.039
- It's a lancet.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.841
It was used for bloodletting.

32:56.841 --> 32:59.677
When they just didn't use
 good old-fashioned leeches.

32:59.677 --> 33:00.845
Draining your blood
 was one of the main

33:00.845 --> 33:02.513
methods of medicine back then.

33:02.513 --> 33:03.348
That and

33:03.348 --> 33:04.849
exorcism, of course.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.184
- You have issues,

33:06.184 --> 33:07.719
my dear.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.153
- What are these?

33:10.154 --> 33:11.422
- I'm not sure.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.859
They look like a version
of the clay vessels

33:14.859 --> 33:17.895
they used when they
 cremated someone.

33:17.895 --> 33:21.199
- Sounds like the lady of the
 house had a dark side, too.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.234
- Madame Fiora had a
long history of illness,

33:23.234 --> 33:24.969
both physical and mental.

33:24.969 --> 33:26.404
It's well-documented
 that she dabbled in

33:26.404 --> 33:30.408
a lot of the alternative
 medicines of that time period.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.642
In fact,

33:31.642 --> 33:33.845
they say she died during
one of the treatments.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.779
Actually...

33:34.779 --> 33:36.347
Right in this room.

33:37.415 --> 33:40.084
- [Dr. Lorca] There you are!

33:40.084 --> 33:41.486
- Dr. Lorca!

33:41.486 --> 33:42.820
Sorry.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.722
You just missed the grand tour.

33:44.722 --> 33:47.325
- Please excuse my
  absence, my dear.

33:47.325 --> 33:48.292
Perhaps in the
  morning, you could

33:48.292 --> 33:50.194
give a repeat performance.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.162
- Of course.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.697
- I'd like to invite everyone

33:52.697 --> 33:54.999
to gather in the living
room this evening.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.969
Lillith would like to
conduct a seance there.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.704
With your blessing, of course.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.139
- Sure.

34:01.139 --> 34:02.573
Sounds cool.

34:02.573 --> 34:03.508
- Then...

34:03.508 --> 34:06.244
We will see you all then.

34:06.244 --> 34:07.478
David?

34:07.478 --> 34:10.313
May I speak with
  you for a moment?

34:13.251 --> 34:17.021
(ominous instrumental music)

34:23.161 --> 34:24.362
Do not

34:24.362 --> 34:25.996
complicate our stay
here by getting yourself

34:25.996 --> 34:27.498
involved with her.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.467
- I hardly see how her
 giving me a tour of the place

34:29.467 --> 34:31.202
warrants me getting involved.

34:31.202 --> 34:35.172
- Just do as I say,
and stay away from her!

34:35.172 --> 34:37.275
Or I promise you...

34:37.275 --> 34:40.378
You will pay in a most
 inconvenient fashion.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.612
- Tough guy, eh?

34:41.612 --> 34:43.246
Killing that
 windbag's gonna be a

34:43.246 --> 34:44.949
real kick in the diapers!

34:44.949 --> 34:47.284
(mischievous laughter)

34:47.284 --> 34:48.119
Shh!

34:48.119 --> 34:50.254
Shut the fuck up!

34:50.254 --> 34:53.257
- Have I made myself clear?

34:53.257 --> 34:54.091
- Very.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.032
- [Lauraline] Daddy?

35:02.366 --> 35:04.202
Don't keep me waiting!

35:06.671 --> 35:07.505
(screams)

35:07.505 --> 35:08.673
Where are you?

35:11.476 --> 35:15.246
- It's time to bring on
a little more mayhem.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.716
And you.

35:18.716 --> 35:19.917
Either you're with us,

35:19.917 --> 35:21.752
or you're against us.

35:21.752 --> 35:24.589
Kill or be killed, guido.

35:24.589 --> 35:29.393
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:29.393 --> 35:30.495
- Everything okay?

35:30.495 --> 35:31.762
- Yeah.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.197
Seems like Divoletto
 might not be

35:33.197 --> 35:36.200
the only thing the good
 doctor wants from this place.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.371
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:40.371 --> 35:42.373
- Hey y'all, come
  look over here!

35:42.373 --> 35:46.444
(suspenseful instrumental music)

35:49.714 --> 35:50.882
- Oh, what do you know?

35:50.882 --> 35:53.151
Another deep and
 dark, scary staircase.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.086
- [Mr. Butterfield] Ooh,
I wonder where it leads?

35:55.086 --> 35:56.921
- I don't know.

35:56.921 --> 35:57.855
Wanna find out?

35:57.855 --> 36:00.024
- No ma'am, I do not.

36:00.024 --> 36:01.292
- Don't wanna go
on an adventure?

36:01.292 --> 36:04.862
- No, I've had my
 fill of this place.

36:04.862 --> 36:06.197
I'm going to bed.

36:06.197 --> 36:08.399
- Sleep well, Mr. Butterfield.

36:08.399 --> 36:09.233
Ready?

36:09.233 --> 36:10.067
- Yes.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.206
(suspenseful instrumental music)

36:15.206 --> 36:18.309
- You kids keep your
 hands to yourself!

36:18.309 --> 36:20.545
(laughter)

36:21.512 --> 36:23.681
Crack myself up sometimes.

36:24.715 --> 36:28.786
(suspenseful instrumental music)

36:30.521 --> 36:32.790
(laughter)

36:36.861 --> 36:39.797
(thunder rumbling)

36:47.205 --> 36:50.374
(clock chime ringing)

37:04.789 --> 37:07.458
(thunder claps)

37:08.759 --> 37:11.929
(clock chime droning)

37:32.350 --> 37:36.454
(suspenseful instrumental music)

37:50.668 --> 37:52.937
(shouting)

37:54.138 --> 37:58.242
(suspenseful instrumental music)

38:17.695 --> 38:21.165
- Why can't I get a read on you?

38:21.165 --> 38:24.101
(thunder rumbling)

38:25.403 --> 38:27.805
Feeling shy, my little gnome?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.574
- [Voiceover] That's it.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.977
Make sure it looks
  exactly the same.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.212
(laughter)

38:36.447 --> 38:39.350
(suspenseful instrumental music)

38:39.350 --> 38:41.986
(steady rumbling)

38:41.986 --> 38:44.922
(eerie whispering)

38:46.691 --> 38:50.761
(suspenseful instrumental music)

38:58.069 --> 39:00.438
(eerie whispering)

39:00.438 --> 39:03.641
(distorted deep voice)

39:06.077 --> 39:07.912
- [Voiceover] Free me!

39:08.779 --> 39:09.613
Free me!

39:11.382 --> 39:14.285
(eerie whispering)

39:15.453 --> 39:16.287
Free me!

39:17.621 --> 39:21.726
(suspenseful instrumental music)

39:51.756 --> 39:54.425
(metallic bang)

39:54.425 --> 39:58.162
(ominous instrumental music)

40:30.060 --> 40:32.897
(ghastly moaning)

40:36.534 --> 40:39.470
(eerie whispering)

40:43.541 --> 40:46.310
(eerie laughter)

41:01.725 --> 41:04.728
(maniacal laughter)

41:08.098 --> 41:11.936
(dramatic instrumental music)

41:19.076 --> 41:20.277
(grunts)

41:20.277 --> 41:21.912
- Where in the hell,

41:21.912 --> 41:22.746
are you?

41:24.849 --> 41:26.550
- I am right here, my lady.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.885
- Oh!

41:27.885 --> 41:29.153
Daddy!

41:29.153 --> 41:30.387
There you are.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.556
I was getting worried.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.592
Did you hear that noise?

41:34.592 --> 41:36.427
- Never fear, my lover.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.828
The doctor is in.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.665
- I'll be the judge of that.

41:49.406 --> 41:51.976
(wind howling)

41:52.843 --> 41:55.613
(laughter)

41:55.613 --> 41:59.116
(light suspenseful music)

42:05.289 --> 42:06.957
- What have we here?

42:08.025 --> 42:10.261
They ain't gonna miss this.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.464
Ooh.

42:13.464 --> 42:16.166
This could be worth a fortune!

42:16.166 --> 42:20.271
(suspenseful instrumental music)

42:23.507 --> 42:24.341
Well.

42:27.778 --> 42:29.213
Mm hmm.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.047
Mm hmm.

42:31.015 --> 42:31.849
Mm hmm.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.018
This'll do.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.824
(suspenseful instrumental music)

42:47.798 --> 42:50.134
- [Caitlin] Watch your step.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.703
Come on, over here.

42:54.104 --> 42:55.606
Wow.

42:55.606 --> 42:56.573
- [David] Housekeeping
  obviously doesn't make it

42:56.573 --> 42:58.676
to this part of the castle.

42:58.676 --> 43:02.046
(eerie mocking laughter)

43:03.080 --> 43:06.817
(ominous instrumental music)

43:18.896 --> 43:21.231
- [Caitlin] Watch your head.

43:33.577 --> 43:35.212
Come on.

43:35.212 --> 43:37.414
- [David] Are you
  sure about this?

43:37.414 --> 43:38.349
- What?

43:38.349 --> 43:39.683
Are you chicken?

43:41.485 --> 43:42.686
(bats screeching)

43:42.686 --> 43:45.522
(screaming)

43:45.522 --> 43:49.360
(dramatic instrumental music)

43:55.532 --> 43:57.835
(ominous instrumental music)

43:57.835 --> 43:58.669
- Wow.

44:00.704 --> 44:03.507
- [Caitlin] It's
  a natural cavern.

44:06.110 --> 44:08.912
(metallic creaking)

44:08.912 --> 44:12.149
(eerie faint whispers)

44:14.918 --> 44:15.753
- [David] What?

44:15.753 --> 44:17.654
What's that over there?

44:18.589 --> 44:21.859
(eerie faint whispers)

44:23.427 --> 44:26.997
(eerie instrumental music)

44:32.202 --> 44:34.605
- [Caitlin] Predijum Abyssus.

44:35.906 --> 44:37.741
It's a portal to hell.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.348
We're underneath the castle.

44:48.685 --> 44:50.421
That's where I found Divoletto.

44:50.421 --> 44:51.755
There's where I dug him up.

44:51.755 --> 44:55.359
(eerie instrumental music)

45:21.852 --> 45:22.753
- Hey.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.688
It's one of those pots.

45:24.688 --> 45:26.824
- Just like the
  one from upstairs.

45:26.824 --> 45:29.626
(eerie instrumental music)

45:29.626 --> 45:31.528
Soul of the damned one.

45:33.630 --> 45:34.798
- It's pretty.

45:37.334 --> 45:38.802
- What is this?

45:38.802 --> 45:42.372
(eerie instrumental music)

45:59.957 --> 46:00.891
It's so old.

46:10.701 --> 46:12.436
Predijium Excorcisio.

46:14.171 --> 46:15.005
Hmm.

46:18.942 --> 46:21.011
It's an exorcist journal.

46:26.316 --> 46:27.551
- [David] Pretty gruesome.

46:27.551 --> 46:30.387
(bats fluttering)

46:33.023 --> 46:36.627
(eerie instrumental music)

46:40.330 --> 46:43.233
(thunder clapping)

46:45.335 --> 46:48.839
(light suspenseful music)

47:15.432 --> 47:17.868
(mischievous laughter)

47:17.868 --> 47:20.804
- Thank you for my
 blessings, baby Jesus.

47:20.804 --> 47:21.638
Amen.

47:25.676 --> 47:26.510
Oh shit.

47:29.213 --> 47:31.448
(wooden creaking)

47:31.448 --> 47:33.217
Who's there?

47:33.217 --> 47:36.620
(light suspenseful music)

47:36.620 --> 47:37.454
Damn cats.

47:41.658 --> 47:42.626
- [Baby Doll] This way!

47:42.626 --> 47:43.727
Stay low!

47:43.727 --> 47:47.231
(light suspenseful music)

47:50.167 --> 47:52.636
- That's enough of that.

47:52.636 --> 47:53.704
- [Baby Doll] Shh!

47:53.704 --> 47:54.705
Shh!

47:54.705 --> 47:55.973
(glass shattering)

47:55.973 --> 47:57.641
Whoopsie daisy!

47:57.641 --> 48:01.578
(mischievous laughter)

48:01.578 --> 48:03.614
(glass shattering)

48:03.614 --> 48:05.816
(mischievous laughter)

48:05.816 --> 48:07.517
Time to be toyed with!

48:07.517 --> 48:10.787
(mischievous laughter)

48:13.156 --> 48:14.157
Let's party!

48:15.058 --> 48:16.627
(sobbing)

48:16.627 --> 48:19.630
Okay boys, I think we
put enough scare in him.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.897
Why don't we all go downstairs

48:20.897 --> 48:24.101
for a nice bottle of
 wine in the Jacuzzi?

48:28.772 --> 48:32.075
Right after we cut
 off your fucking head!

48:32.075 --> 48:34.211
(mischievous laughter)

48:34.211 --> 48:35.646
(screaming)

48:35.646 --> 48:37.981
Show your meatballs, guido!

48:37.981 --> 48:39.182
(metallic scrape)

48:39.182 --> 48:42.552
Sorry to ruin your
 trip to Rome, Guides.

48:42.552 --> 48:46.189
(maniacal laughter)

48:46.189 --> 48:49.926
(ominous instrumental music)

48:51.995 --> 48:53.363
- Fiora and her
 doctors were convinced

48:53.363 --> 48:56.199
she was possessed by demons.

48:56.199 --> 48:57.301
They brought her down here

48:57.301 --> 49:00.370
to perform exorcisms on her.

49:00.370 --> 49:01.171
Jealousy.

49:02.172 --> 49:03.006
Insanity.

49:06.109 --> 49:06.943
Hatred.

49:08.045 --> 49:09.613
Revenge.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.748
The exorcist performed
 rituals on her

49:11.748 --> 49:15.185
to try to rid her of
 her personal demons.

49:17.287 --> 49:18.255
- You don't actually
 believe there are

49:18.255 --> 49:20.857
monsters in these pots.

49:20.857 --> 49:22.859
- Well, not exactly.

49:22.859 --> 49:24.428
See...

49:24.428 --> 49:27.631
Pretend I'm a medieval doctor.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.166
And I tell you I
 can cure all of your

49:29.166 --> 49:30.901
mental illness, by

49:30.901 --> 49:33.003
pulling out your
personal demons,

49:33.003 --> 49:35.405
and sealing them up in these.

49:35.405 --> 49:37.341
That way in your head,

49:37.341 --> 49:39.710
they can't get out.

49:39.710 --> 49:40.544
- Huh.

49:41.678 --> 49:43.447
You are pretty smart.

49:51.121 --> 49:52.356
- Good job!

49:52.356 --> 49:53.190
Good job!

49:54.658 --> 49:56.760
Let's go get the doctor.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.563
Hey, who crapped their pants?

49:59.563 --> 50:01.732
(moaning)

50:11.308 --> 50:14.878
(light suspenseful music)

50:14.878 --> 50:18.348
- I assumed the good
 doctor has left you...

50:18.348 --> 50:19.816
Satisfied as always?

50:19.816 --> 50:20.751
- Oh!

50:20.751 --> 50:23.220
It was just like it always was.

50:26.757 --> 50:28.525
- I do aim to please.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.028
What do you say...

50:32.929 --> 50:34.164
We get dressed,

50:35.165 --> 50:36.833
and head downstairs?

50:38.068 --> 50:41.772
Lillith is preparing
 to perform a seance.

50:41.772 --> 50:44.241
A perfect ending to our tour.

50:44.241 --> 50:48.178
- I'm not in the mood for
  that mumbo jumbo tonight.

50:48.178 --> 50:49.713
I mean...

50:49.713 --> 50:51.081
After all,

50:51.081 --> 50:52.582
your lovemaking has left me

50:52.582 --> 50:54.317
absolutely exhausted!

50:58.722 --> 51:00.857
- What was I thinking?

51:00.857 --> 51:01.658
Of course.

51:03.226 --> 51:06.062
You stay here, my love, and...

51:06.062 --> 51:07.564
Catch your breath.

51:08.465 --> 51:09.833
That is...

51:09.833 --> 51:13.770
Until I return for
 another hot session.

51:13.770 --> 51:14.604
- Oh!

51:14.604 --> 51:15.439
White hot!

51:16.840 --> 51:21.011
Now, go do your little
seance like a good boy.

51:21.011 --> 51:24.614
I'll be here waiting for
you when you get back.

51:24.614 --> 51:25.715
- Until then.

51:28.185 --> 51:30.854
(thunder claps)

51:34.057 --> 51:37.694
(heavy pattering rainfall)

51:37.694 --> 51:40.597
(thunder rumbling)

51:43.733 --> 51:45.535
- [Caitlin] Sorry we're late.

51:45.535 --> 51:46.703
We.

51:46.703 --> 51:49.473
(fire crackling)

51:53.510 --> 51:57.514
(mysterious instrumental music)

52:04.020 --> 52:04.855
- Lillith?

52:05.722 --> 52:09.025
(mysterious instrumental music)

52:09.025 --> 52:10.527
- Candle and char!

52:12.562 --> 52:13.730
Fire and fear!

52:15.565 --> 52:17.167
Portal of the past!

52:18.702 --> 52:20.871
Bring forth her soul here!

52:22.606 --> 52:23.773
I call upon...

52:25.008 --> 52:26.076
Goddess Earl.

52:27.310 --> 52:29.980
I beg you to summon your powers.

52:32.082 --> 52:34.317
Help bring her forth.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.886
I form this circle,

52:36.920 --> 52:38.355
for all that was.

52:39.489 --> 52:40.490
All that is.

52:42.025 --> 52:42.859
And all

52:43.760 --> 52:44.861
that will be!

52:46.730 --> 52:48.064
Let

52:48.064 --> 52:49.132
the circle...

52:51.701 --> 52:53.803
Of these connected souls,

52:56.640 --> 52:57.741
be the portal

52:58.942 --> 53:01.044
that allows her to return.

53:02.479 --> 53:03.480
Allow her...

53:04.981 --> 53:05.916
To exist...

53:08.018 --> 53:09.786
Again, on this plane.

53:11.922 --> 53:12.923
Allow her...

53:14.024 --> 53:15.592
To live once again!

53:17.160 --> 53:18.161
This time...

53:19.296 --> 53:20.630
Without anguish!

53:23.266 --> 53:24.701
Let...

53:24.701 --> 53:26.403
Her voice...

53:26.403 --> 53:27.671
Again...

53:27.671 --> 53:28.505
Be heard!

53:29.372 --> 53:30.407
Let...

53:30.407 --> 53:31.775
Her hand...

53:31.775 --> 53:33.076
Again...

53:33.076 --> 53:33.910
Rule!

53:34.811 --> 53:36.112
I...

53:36.112 --> 53:37.914
Acknowledge...

53:37.914 --> 53:38.748
Her!

53:39.783 --> 53:40.951
I...

53:40.951 --> 53:42.285
Evoke...

53:42.285 --> 53:43.119
Thee!

53:44.020 --> 53:45.422
I...

53:45.422 --> 53:46.990
Evoke...

53:46.990 --> 53:47.824
Thee!

53:48.992 --> 53:49.893
I...

53:49.893 --> 53:51.695
Acknowledge...

53:51.695 --> 53:52.862
Her greatness!

53:54.464 --> 53:55.498
Goddess...

53:55.498 --> 53:56.700
I...

53:56.700 --> 53:57.601
Beg of you!

53:59.135 --> 54:00.236
Let...

54:00.236 --> 54:01.671
Her voice...

54:01.671 --> 54:02.505
Be heard!

54:03.573 --> 54:04.574
Let...

54:04.574 --> 54:05.809
Her voice...

54:05.809 --> 54:06.643
Be heard!

54:07.844 --> 54:08.878
Let...

54:08.878 --> 54:09.713
Thy...

54:10.547 --> 54:11.915
Voice...

54:11.915 --> 54:13.416
Be...

54:13.416 --> 54:14.250
Heard!

54:18.321 --> 54:19.155
- Lillith?

54:21.858 --> 54:22.692
Lillith!

54:25.328 --> 54:26.262
- Well.

54:26.262 --> 54:27.097
- Silence!

54:28.798 --> 54:31.735
(demonic cackling)

54:35.572 --> 54:38.174
(wind howling)

54:41.611 --> 54:45.348
(ominous instrumental music)

54:51.721 --> 54:52.789
Free at last!

54:55.158 --> 54:55.992
Free!

54:57.227 --> 54:58.795
Through them arose.

54:59.863 --> 55:03.333
A great warning (mumbles).

55:03.333 --> 55:04.167
- Lillith!

55:05.602 --> 55:08.204
- Call me by my proper surname!

55:10.974 --> 55:14.277
Or pay with your
babbling tongue!

55:14.277 --> 55:17.847
(eerie instrumental music)

55:22.452 --> 55:24.754
(Lauraline mumbles)

55:24.754 --> 55:28.358
(eerie instrumental music)

55:31.528 --> 55:33.096
- Eric?

55:33.096 --> 55:36.700
(eerie instrumental music)

55:39.836 --> 55:41.571
- Give me your souls!

55:43.139 --> 55:44.741
Tortured and bleak!

55:45.842 --> 55:47.343
Beware the trinket

55:48.211 --> 55:50.146
you come forth to seek!

55:51.881 --> 55:53.316
- Lillith, are you okay?

55:53.316 --> 55:54.718
- I am the ruler!

55:58.455 --> 55:59.889
The great beauty!

56:01.057 --> 56:01.891
Embrace...

56:03.193 --> 56:04.094
Imprisoner!

56:05.862 --> 56:06.696
Destroyer!

56:09.866 --> 56:11.201
Of the old ones!

56:14.204 --> 56:15.438
- The old ones?

56:16.639 --> 56:17.741
- The wicked.

56:19.342 --> 56:20.176
Born...

56:21.511 --> 56:22.345
Of poison

56:24.047 --> 56:25.215
and blackness!

56:26.750 --> 56:27.584
Hatred.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.220
And emptiness!

56:32.822 --> 56:33.656
Doubt

56:35.091 --> 56:36.426
and destruction.

56:37.994 --> 56:39.062
The demons...

56:40.296 --> 56:41.297
Unstoppable!

56:43.767 --> 56:44.901
- Demons?

56:44.901 --> 56:46.136
- Leave here...

56:47.237 --> 56:48.071
Or perish!

56:50.874 --> 56:51.708
Touch.

56:52.575 --> 56:53.409
Nothing.

56:54.778 --> 56:56.880
Leave here and be spared.

56:59.949 --> 57:00.784
But take...

57:02.986 --> 57:03.820
Nothing!

57:05.588 --> 57:07.490
- Are you talking
  about Divoletto?

57:07.490 --> 57:11.227
- Beware the other (mumbles).

57:11.227 --> 57:13.863
(mumbles)

57:13.863 --> 57:15.598
by those who conspire

57:16.633 --> 57:17.634
against you!

57:18.568 --> 57:21.971
(suspenseful instrumental music)

57:21.971 --> 57:23.139
- Who are you?

57:28.044 --> 57:28.878
- I...

57:29.979 --> 57:30.814
Am...

57:33.283 --> 57:34.117
Fiora!

57:35.318 --> 57:38.087
(ominous instrumental music)

57:38.087 --> 57:38.922
Ruler!

57:40.657 --> 57:41.491
Murderess!

57:43.960 --> 57:44.794
Sadist!

57:47.363 --> 57:50.900
(hissing static)

57:50.900 --> 57:54.571
(exotic instrumental music)

57:59.909 --> 58:00.677
Temptress!

58:02.846 --> 58:06.516
(exotic instrumental music)

59:05.275 --> 59:07.543
(laughter)

59:08.411 --> 59:12.081
(exotic instrumental music)

59:27.330 --> 59:28.164
- Eric?

59:38.341 --> 59:39.175
Eric?

59:42.245 --> 59:43.079
Eric?

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.129
(gasps)

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:05.068
(exotic instrumental music)

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.552
- So you're looking for a ghost,

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.786
hey guido?

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:27.457
(exotic instrumental music)

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.246
(screaming)

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:51.381
- Lillith?

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:55.151
(ominous instrumental music)

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.592
- Where is the doll?

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:06.763
(ominous instrumental music)

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.831
(grunts)

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.773
(fire crackling)

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.675
- Lillith?

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:25.014
(mysterious instrumental music)

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.418
- How long was I out?

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.319
- Not very long.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.454
Here.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:32.955
- Never mind that.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.024
What were you experiencing?

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:35.892
How did it feel?

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.693
Tell me everything!

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.195
- [Lillith] I don't remember.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.064
- Where you conscious
 the entire time?

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.565
I must know everything, Lillith!

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:45.334
What did you learn from this?

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.436
- Everything!

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.605
Yet...

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:50.440
Nothing!

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:53.009
That doll...

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.879
Is a replica!

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.514
- What?

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.349
- That's not possible.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:02.251
- Sure it is!

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:06.956
(screaming)

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.858
(maniacal laughter)

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:11.194
Take that, you stupid cracker!

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:15.264
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.702
- [Lauraline] Hello!

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:24.607
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.144
Oh!

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:31.047
(joyful screaming)

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:35.418
(joyful screaming)

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.588
- Get those lips off
 your stupid faces

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.923
and someone put on
 some fucking music!

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.391
I wanna rock!

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:43.693
Ah, what's wrong?

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.627
Don't you want me to be

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.796
part of your collection anymore?

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:49.232
(wooden rattling)

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.434
Ah, there's the real deal.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:54.504
You've been (mumbles)
bamboozled, sugar tits!

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.772
(mischievous laughter)

01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:58.107
Guido, snap too!

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.442
Look out!

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.277
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:02.545
(scream)

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.913
Fuck me!

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.148
(gunshot)

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.883
Ah, my skull!

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:09.152
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:12.088
(joyful screaming)

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:21.664
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:26.402
(music box melody)

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.804
(screaming)

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:33.142
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.644
- [David] Where do we go?

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.112
- That way.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.046
We can go down the stairs
  and out the back exit.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.348
- We have to find Butterfield.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:40.950
- I don't think so.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.153
- Lorca, what are you doing?

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.621
- We have to get out of here!

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.156
- I'm not leaving here
 without those toys,

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.591
and neither are you!

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.126
And you're going to
 use your intuition

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.694
to help me find them.

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.895
- Are you crazy?

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.363
You saw what those
  things can do!

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.765
- Well, we'll just
  have to make sure

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.066
we have the upper hand

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.035
the next time they strike.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.269
That is,

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.771
after we figure
  out if it was you

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:04.907
who tried to switch the
  dolls in the first place!

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.175
Because...

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.510
If it was you...

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:10.413
I promise...

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.416
That you'll be
 wishing that you were

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.483
already dead!

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.223
(crack)

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:21.290
- [David] Go!

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.828
Been waiting to do
  that a long time.

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:31.234
(thunder clapping)

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:36.172
(wind howling)

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.408
- Help!

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:40.476
Help me!

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.711
- Lauraline?

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:45.748
(mischievous laughter)

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.049
- She caused all this!

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.251
- What are you talking about?

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.385
- [Voiceover] Come
  out, come out,

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.554
wherever you are!

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.889
(screaming)

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:56.559
- Lauraline.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:57.660
(mischievous laughter)

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.296
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.700
- [Caitlin] No, you're
 not thinking straight!

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.202
- [David] Don't do this!

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:08.671
- [Caitlin] Drop
the gun, please!

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.939
- [David] Give me the gun!

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.941
(mischievous laughter)

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:12.875
Lauraline?

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:16.612
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.288
- This

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.122
is all

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.690
your fault!

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.925
You're the one that
 dug that thing up!

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.227
- We need to get out of here!

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:32.762
- Give me the gun!

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.031
(grunting)

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:39.335
- I should have killed
you off a long time ago!

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:40.169
Just like

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:43.639
I did your old man!

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.408
- David, no, look out!

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.677
(gunshot)

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:51.180
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.014
David!

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:55.151
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:55.985
- [David] I'm okay.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:56.919
I'm okay.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:57.753
- [Caitlin] Can you walk?

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:58.954
- [David] Yeah.

01:05:58.954 --> 01:05:59.889
- [Caitlin] Okay,
 let's get out of here.

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.090
(dramatic instrumental music)

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:01.957
- [Dr. Lorca] What
  have you done?

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:02.992
- [Caitlin] Stay back!

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:03.826
- [David] Lorca!

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.761
No, stay away from her!

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:09.765
(gun clicking)

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.369
(laughter)

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.837
- Come on, let's
get out of here!

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.906
- [Dr. Lorca] Come back here!

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:21.010
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.583
- [David] Oh wait,
 the dungeon stairs!

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.684
Come on!

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:32.755
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:38.094
(thunder rumbling)

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:42.031
(mysterious instrumental music)

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:42.865
- Lillith!

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.168
Lillith, come on!

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:50.272
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.781
(growling)

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:03.552
(ominous instrumental music)

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:09.058
(growling)

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:14.263
- Where are you?

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.097
David!

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.567
Where are you?

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.336
(growling)

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.771
Come out now!

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.105
Or be prepared--

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.674
- Die!

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.276
(screaming)

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:30.346
(liquid squishing)

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.847
Ride 'em cowboy!

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:32.681
Yeehaw!

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.288
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.356
There you go.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:42.525
That's it.

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:43.959
Embrace it.

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.494
Embrace it.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:47.830
Just let death wash over you

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.165
like a good boy.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.034
Whoopsie daisy!

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:54.069
(mischievous laughter)

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.971
Now who needs a diaper?

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.775
Nice try.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.445
(evil cackling)

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.680
(groaning)

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.458
Baby go night night.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:18.093
(evil cackling)

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:21.130
(low rumbling)

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.666
(shuffling footsteps)

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:24.899
Hmm,

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.502
I wonder if anyone has
 any blow up in here.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:30.072
(low rumbling)

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:35.778
(suspenseful instrumental music)

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:42.051
(bats chirping)

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.089
- He stopped.

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:49.725
(mysterious instrumental music)

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.228
Lillith, are you feeling okay?

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.098
- Perfect.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:00.569
- Let's keep moving.
