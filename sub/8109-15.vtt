more accurate to...

so far away.

caught in my throat.

you're not supposed

01:14.157 --> 01:15.738
to have any food
or drinks in here.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.782
It's just water.
I have a cough,

01:17.869 --> 01:19.996
I didn't want to
disturb anyone.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.867
We can only observe
4% of the universe.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.494
The rest of it
is unaccounted for.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.371
I never knew
you were such
a good liar.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.838
Well, a little more vodka
and you might find out
some more things

01:28.922 --> 01:30.253

about me.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.671
Really?

01:31.758 --> 01:32.964
MR. DAMON: Nicholas.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.086
Yes, sir.

01:34.177 --> 01:38.261
What conclusions can we
draw from the incredible
number of stars?

01:38.348 --> 01:40.930
That the movie's either
gonna be really good
or really bad.

about the implications

01:47.774 --> 01:51.517
Well, I guess if
there's an infinite
number of stars,

01:51.612 --> 01:53.102
odds are there's
at least one galaxy

01:53.196 --> 01:54.572
with life other
than our own.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.941
Or?

01:57.034 --> 01:58.399
Or not?

01:58.493 --> 02:02.327
Or our solar system
is somehow unique.

02:02.414 --> 02:05.121
The question
then becomes,
in what way?

02:05.208 --> 02:09.201
The question then becomes,
could you possibly teach us
anything more useless?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.951
Yes, you will.

have a good excuse.

go get a table?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.563

Means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

of trauma.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.278

have needed me
to take the case.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.623
How'd you know Cuddy...

one with the balls

04:54.711 --> 04:56.326
to take a case
without checking
with me

04:56.421 --> 05:00.039
and he's still
working on breakfast,
which means that

05:01.885 --> 05:05.844
the 18, no, 17-year-old
honor student...

05:05.931 --> 05:09.469
Cuddy has a soft spot
for smart girls,

05:09.559 --> 05:10.935
and they don't
start drinking

05:11.019 --> 05:13.351
until second semester
senior year.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.145
So, either you think
that smart women
look out for each other,

05:16.233 --> 05:17.268
which means
you're an idiot,

05:17.359 --> 05:20.021
or you think
Cuddy's not smart,
which means...

05:20.111 --> 05:21.817
Well, I guess it's
the same both ways.

he wanted me to know.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.744

He's waiting for a tow truck.

FOREMAN: What about
rising blood pressure
from binge drinking?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.839
It could set off
a hypertensive crisis,
cause heart failure.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.504
Two drinks is
hardly a binge.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.502
Certainly not if
you're an Aussie,

05:43.593 --> 05:45.049

05:45.136 --> 05:46.546

before 10:00 am,

05:46.638 --> 05:49.220
it's a pretty sure bet
that the plan
is to have a lot more.

It probably
wasn't the first time
she had that plan.

ever do anything
together anymore.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.800
Now you don't
want me to do it?

No.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.200

12:07.310 --> 12:09.392
TAUB: TEE and
infra-operative

12:09.479 --> 12:11.686
showed no vegetations
on the valves,

12:11.773 --> 12:13.388
no structural
abnormalities.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.064
The dissection means
we were wrong

12:15.151 --> 12:17.392
about alcohol causing
a hypertensive crisis.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.398
And by "we"
you mean "you."
Yeah.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.400
You were the one
who didn't have
any better ideas.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.574
It's not my fault.
I was busy trying
to judge Taub.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.822
Since we already
ruled out trauma,

12:26.913 --> 12:28.369
the dissection's
probably a genetic defect.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.447
We're running the tests.
She's not marfanoid.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.156
What about an allergy?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.415
A severe enough one
could set off a systemic
immune reaction,

12:35.505 --> 12:38.588
cause fluid in the lungs
and inflammation that
could weaken the aorta.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.587
If it was an allergy,
she'd be getting better
in the hospital, not worse.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.669
Unless it was
inside her.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.714
Meaning?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.050
You want my sperm?

12:50.144 --> 12:53.978
We think a severe allergic
reaction could be causing
a systemic breakdown.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.601
To my son's sperm?

12:55.692 --> 12:58.980
Actually, his semen is
more likely the problem,

12:59.070 --> 13:01.311
which I realize
is not what you
were reacting to.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.944
When's the last time
the two of you
had unprotected sex?

13:06.035 --> 13:07.775

I use a condom.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.862
You always use a condom?
For everything?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.036

13:20.425 --> 13:23.633
I'm placing a drop of
Nick's semen protein
onto the skin.

13:34.188 --> 13:38.101
I'm not mad, sweetheart.
I'm just confused.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.525
A systemic reaction
can be triggered
by the protein in semen.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.025
In most cases,
the reaction
is fairly minor,

13:45.116 --> 13:47.232
but in rare cases,
repeat exposure

13:47.327 --> 13:49.864
can trigger
a hypersensitivity
response.

"Repeat exposure"?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.789
I know, I know,
three years.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.583
Is this
supposed
to hurt?

13:58.421 --> 13:59.786
A reaction should
take longer than...

13:59.881 --> 14:01.166
No, it's not that. Ow.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.351
It's not syphilis.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.279
Wouldn't cause
the edema
or dissection.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.205
But cancer could.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.703
Would you care
to be a little bit
more specific?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.751
If I could,
I would've.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.792
We could do
a full body scan.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.920
We hate
full body scans.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.967
And by "we"
you mean "you."

14:49.055 --> 14:50.761

14:59.899 --> 15:02.231
How can you convince
someone you're not
cheating on them?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.934
Don't cheat.
After a while,
they'll catch on.

she still cares.

think I want my wife

could explain both.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.987

the blood vessel walls

leads to dissection
in the aorta

An aneurysm explains
the hallucinations,

and it's the one thing
we haven't excluded
from the differential.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.600
Your texting does not
prove you're faithful.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.353

19:25.915 --> 19:27.405
You get an ulcer,
you don't know it,

but the brain increases
mucin secretions.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.086
It knows what
the problem is,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.501
it knows where
the problem is.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.176
if you need to go
to the bathroom?

19:41.263 --> 19:44.096
Sure. That's the same
as the brain shouting,
"You have pancreatic cancer."

19:44.183 --> 19:47.220
Her subconscious
is trying to tell
her something.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.302
We need to eavesdrop.

She was screaming
she was being sucked
into a black hole.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.523
So we should look for
a tumor in her anus.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.817
We need the whole story.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.236
A cognitive pattern
recognition program

19:59.323 --> 20:01.564
might tell us what's
going on in her head.

Or we could act
on something

24:53.033 --> 24:55.649
is 50 years from being
a useful diagnostic tool.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.577
Even ifwe can get the
equipment, it takes hours
for the initial mapping.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.700
If she has another seizure,
she could stroke out.

25:00.791 --> 25:03.908
Coincidentally,
she could also have a
stroke ifwe do nothing.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.085
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

25:06.171 --> 25:07.911
that our best shot
is a magic trick.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.293
It's not magical,
it's experimental.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.217
Just like washing
your hands after
pooping once was.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.259
And technically,
it's not our best shot.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.258
I'm pretty sure
it's our only shot.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.889
Perfect. So, Foreman,
go get her consent.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.266
The rest of you,
go down to
the cog-sci lab.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.313
The equipment
should already be there.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.946
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

25:37.327 --> 25:39.033
I'll catch up.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.074
Thanks for the invite.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.001
I am not sure I'm up
for the hospital food.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.000
Good, 'cause I wasn't
planning on lunch.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.125
While you watch
video clips,

25:54.219 --> 25:57.586
a computer maps
how your brain
processes the images.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.296
How long
will it take?

26:02.186 --> 26:04.973
Once the computer maps
how she processes
the information,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.929
we'll put her under
twilight sedation,

26:07.024 --> 26:10.061
use the same equipment
to monitor her
unconscious thoughts.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.313
Hopefully, it'll spit
out a very basic video

26:12.404 --> 26:14.144
of whatever's
going on in her head.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.025
And what will
that tell you?

26:16.116 --> 26:17.731
Hopefully,
it'll give us a clue

26:17.826 --> 26:19.987
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.694
A lot of "hopefullys."

26:21.789 --> 26:23.495
Could it hurt her?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.365
We're at
a diagnostic
dead end.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.041
We've got to
try something.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.927
This is much better
thanlunch.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.379
I agree.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.100
What made you
think of this?

26:46.188 --> 26:47.553
I missed you.

26:48.023 --> 26:52.733
No, I mean this.
The car in the
parking lot.

26:53.695 --> 26:54.901
ljust don't like
feeling like

26:54.988 --> 26:56.899
maybe this isn't
the first time
you've done this.

26:56.990 --> 27:00.824
It's the first. I love you.
You know that, right?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.026
Yes.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.327
I want you to be
able to trust me.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.284
And I want to, but...

27:17.469 --> 27:20.757
Inspiration Point
doesn't open
till after dark.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.260
Got a real
cool magic show
about to start.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.973
Also, I'm gonna need
to check your spare.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.711
Abby, can you think
of something specific?

27:57.801 --> 27:58.881
Like what?

27:58.969 --> 28:01.460
Doesn't matter.
Just make it
a single image.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.108
What are you thinking?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.940
About Nick
playing baseball.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.571
Holy crap.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.696
CHASE: That's amazing.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.776
Yeah.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.492
Now all we have to do
is read her subconscious

28:29.625 --> 28:33.459
and hope that
it's completely rational
and went to med school.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.837
Does anything
get you excited?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.223
Can I help you
with something?

28:48.310 --> 28:49.390
Yes.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.185
l was wondering if
you could tell me

28:52.272 --> 28:54.433
a little bit about
this dining table.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.231
It's made of wood
and you eat off it.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.320
So you're paid
by commission?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.393
It's furniture.

29:00.489 --> 29:03.652
Find something you like,
let me know, I'll ring it up.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.074
Thank you so much.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.231
Okay, that's...
That's not...

29:44.032 --> 29:47.115
That is
a remarkable collection,
if I can show it to you.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.738
I'm Gabriella.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.951
I'm reallyjust
looking for a nice
dining room table.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.453
I see. You're daring.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.126
Yes, I do that sometimes.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.956
But right now,
why am I daring?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.302
You're not
constrained by rules.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.253
What else attracts you
in the patio section?

30:07.347 --> 30:10.714
Wait. This is
a patio table?
For outside?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.654
Well, it's taken us
just over an hour

30:30.746 --> 30:33.909
to prove
that she has a very
boring subconscious.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.703
Anyone ever tell
you you can be
a real buzzkill?

30:36.793 --> 30:38.124
ALL: Yes.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.748
Stars. Maybe
that's a stripe.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.549
It's the sky.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.337
She's thinking
about the moon and
the stars in the sky.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.673
She's going to Stanford
to study physics.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.100
It's not a big revelation
that she'd think
about the sky.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.100
Or a star could be
a white blood cell.
Leukemia?

31:04.946 --> 31:06.402
Who's that?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.030
Her dad? He died
when she was eight.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.982
What did Daddy die of?

31:11.411 --> 31:13.527
Private plane crash.
No connection.

31:13.622 --> 31:18.707
Stars, moon, sky,
white blood cells,
heart valves,

31:18.794 --> 31:20.375
black holes, or anus,

31:20.462 --> 31:23.124
or a million other
circular passageways
into the body,

31:23.799 --> 31:25.130
and her dad.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.378
What do you think
it means?

31:27.636 --> 31:30.628
She likes school and
she has daddy issues.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.468
Neither of which
helps us.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.475
So now what do we do?
Start over?

31:40.565 --> 31:41.975
We obviously
missed something.

31:42.818 --> 31:43.807
What about the liver?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.642
What about her left toe?

31:45.737 --> 31:46.897
Oh, sorry,

31:46.988 --> 31:48.819
I thought we were randomly
picking out body parts

31:48.907 --> 31:50.738
that had nothing to
do with her symptoms.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.908
Liver's responsible
for proteins,

31:52.994 --> 31:55.576
immunological effects,
production of
red blood cells.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.872
Might be able to
explains the lungs,
the hallucinations...

31:58.959 --> 32:01.120
Not the aortic
dissection.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.327
CHASE: Her kidneys
are also failing.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.922
Polycystic disease
could explain
the dissection.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.839
So, that's one
imperfect theory

32:08.927 --> 32:11.339
plus a rare complication
of a second theory,

32:11.430 --> 32:14.092
which gives us
a complete
explanation.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.258
Don't polish
the notion, Foreman.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.057
Pineal gland
is calcified.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.106
It's supposed
to be calcified.
Happens after puberty.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.683
What if it's
obscuring a tumor?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.686
It's the only place
we couldn't
look inside.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.282
Get a better look
at her pineal gland

32:31.366 --> 32:34.199
with three Tesla
fast-spin echo MRI.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.791
You're pacing my office
'cause you're
buying furniture?

32:43.879 --> 32:45.415
No. I'm pacing
your office

32:45.505 --> 32:48.417
because I'm physically
incapable of buying furniture.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.464
For Amber's old place?

32:51.595 --> 32:53.551
Yeah. It needs
some new...

32:53.638 --> 32:55.253
I know you bought
the place I wanted.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.215
You're a jerk,
let's move on.
Hire a decorator.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.926
I'm supposed to find me.

33:01.021 --> 33:03.103
Backpack through Europe.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.847
I know it's hard
to believe,

33:04.941 --> 33:06.056
but you know
what says even more

33:06.151 --> 33:08.312
about who you are
than your furniture?

33:08.403 --> 33:10.018
The fact that
you are letting House

33:10.113 --> 33:12.490
tell you how
to buy furniture.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.735
Call Beatrice.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.785
(DOOR OPENS)

33:27.255 --> 33:30.372
MRI revealed
no remarkable features
on her pineal gland,

33:30.467 --> 33:32.003
but there were
slightly elevated levels

33:32.093 --> 33:34.880
of lactate
dehydrogenase
isoenzymes.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.340
Which we would
expect to see

33:36.431 --> 33:38.467
if there was an allergic
reaction happening.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.844
There's definitely
no allergy.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.636
Parasite? There's this
Middle Eastern parasite...

33:44.731 --> 33:47.438
How exactly do you
want to be shot down?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.232
On the basis of the fact
that she's never

33:49.319 --> 33:51.275
been within 6,000 miles
of the Middle East.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.194
Or on the basis of the fact
that all our scans

33:53.281 --> 33:56.239
and urine samples
came back clean.

33:57.827 --> 34:01.115
And yet she's still failing.
System after system.

34:04.042 --> 34:08.081
So, either we find
the answer at autopsy or...

34:12.717 --> 34:13.797
What?

34:17.556 --> 34:19.046
I got nothing.

34:56.886 --> 35:01.175
I was gonna head out.
If there's any change,
I assume you'll page me.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.174
Are you having
an affair?

35:06.896 --> 35:09.433
Does it bother you
that your wife
doesn't have the guts

35:09.524 --> 35:11.936
to actually ask
that question and I do?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.688
On both ends, yes.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.277
Difference is,
I'm not afraid
of the answer.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.229
And I might
believe you.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.440
I'm not having an affair.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.649
But you want to.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.280
No, I don't.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.110
I'm through
living like that.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.741
VVhy?

35:25.832 --> 35:26.912
What, you finally
got to the point

35:27.000 --> 35:28.615
where half your
age plus seven

35:28.710 --> 35:30.746
just isn't
young enough?

35:30.837 --> 35:32.338
Talk to you later, House.

35:32.422 --> 35:36.210
Or is it because
you now really are
old enough to be their...

35:39.929 --> 35:41.339
The dad.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.885
Does he travel for work?

35:45.727 --> 35:49.185
What do you mean, does he?
He died almost 10 years ago.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.351
Not hers.
Her boyfriend's.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.727
He's the one
in her visions.

36:01.076 --> 36:04.239
I'm your son's
girlfriend's doctor.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.406
Oh!

36:06.081 --> 36:09.573
It's a mouthful,
but probably not as
tricky as your title.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.954
Okay. ls Abby
gonna be all right?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.497
Do you travel a lot?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.579
Yeah, I have a food
import business. Why?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.084
Where do you go?

36:17.175 --> 36:20.212
All over. France, Italy,
the Mediterranean? Why?

36:20.929 --> 36:23.636
I think you exposed her
to a parasite.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.092
Oh!

36:25.934 --> 36:27.674
I thought the scans
didn't show any.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.680
Because she doesn't
have any.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.557
But you just said...
It's cool.

36:31.648 --> 36:36.017
My theory is that
her body was able to
kill off the parasite,

36:36.111 --> 36:39.569
but what it couldn't do
was get rid of the shell,

36:39.656 --> 36:41.942
which doesn't
show up on the scans.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.945
That little piece of
microscopic garbage

36:45.036 --> 36:49.279
set off
an allergic reaction called
Cerebellar Schistosomiasis

36:49.374 --> 36:54.368
delayed Hypersensitivity
Allergy or "CSDHA."

36:54.838 --> 36:58.046
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.418
Well, that's fantastic.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.842
You'd think so,
wouldn't you?
Only thing is,

37:02.971 --> 37:06.213
did you ever
have sex with your
son's girlfriend?

37:08.810 --> 37:09.890
Where the hell
do you get off...

37:09.978 --> 37:11.639
Shut up.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.515
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.936
The only way she could
have been exposed

37:18.027 --> 37:19.642
to this parasite
is sexually,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.444
which means she's
gonna die very soon

37:21.531 --> 37:23.067
unless you admit
that you slept with her.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.744

37:29.831 --> 37:31.241
Gee, this is bad,

37:31.332 --> 37:32.617
because you now have
to choose between

37:32.709 --> 37:35.997
her living
and the truth
becoming public,

37:36.087 --> 37:40.000
and frankly,
given what the truth is,
it's a tough call.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.425
You'd broken up.
She was crying...

37:47.766 --> 37:50.178
Your girlfriend is not
allergic to your semen.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.259
She's allergic to
the Egyptian parasites

37:52.353 --> 37:54.935
swimming around
in your dad's semen.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.396
You slept with Abby?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.780
I was drunk. We both...

38:02.864 --> 38:05.947
No need to explain.
Technically,
she was legal.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.614
Wait, wait! Wait!

38:12.499 --> 38:16.913
Hey, all things considered,
it's actually great news.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.051
So, what do
you think?

38:34.646 --> 38:36.932
You wussed out
and used a decorator.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.140
Why can't that be me?
A wuss who loves decorators.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.270
Because it's not.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.771
Okay, it's not.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.774
But don't return it.
I can't keep doing this.

38:45.865 --> 38:50.074
You have to.
You can't keep letting
other people define you.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.154
Not another elephant.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.760
The decorator
didn't pick this.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.559
You're gonna have
to buy your own cape.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.072
(PLAYING ENTHRALLING TUNE)

39:40.086 --> 39:42.498
I like what this says
about you, Wilson.

(PLAYING
PROGRESSIVE ROCK TUNE)

40:20.209 --> 40:21.915
(INAUDIBLE)

41:00.625 --> 41:03.116
Wait, I don't remember him
at the wedding, do you?

41:03.211 --> 41:06.203
(CHUCKLING) I don't
remember most of the people
who were at our wedding.

41:09.509 --> 41:11.420
Which is why

41:13.221 --> 41:16.554
I thought I'd ask
the love of my life
to marry me.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.263
We're already married.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.398
I want to be
better at it.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.476
Well, that's beautiful.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.655
(INAUDIBLE)

41:59.058 --> 42:00.889
What did you tell him?

42:00.977 --> 42:03.309
That it doesn't mean
she doesn't love him.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.270
And he bought it?

42:07.442 --> 42:08.852
It's true.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.937
Your wife say yes?

42:16.492 --> 42:17.527
How did you know...

42:17.618 --> 42:19.449
Monkey see,
monkey do.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.283
At least he has the
"young and stupid" excuse.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.910
She said yes.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.456
Good for you.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.248
Thank you.
