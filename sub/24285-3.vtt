-Were we just lucky
that all these things
happened to be in place?

45:01.003 --> 45:03.971
Well, of course if they
weren't in place, we wouldn't

45:04.073 --> 45:07.908
be here and I wouldn't
be talking about this.

45:13.249 --> 45:15.483
WILL SMITH: Next time you
take a walk outside when the

45:15.585 --> 45:18.786
sun is high in the sky...

45:21.224 --> 45:24.625
take a moment and think
about the iron churning at the

45:24.727 --> 45:29.263
Earth's core, the oxygen
bubbling out from under the sea,

45:29.365 --> 45:33.134
the rain crashing onto
the rocks, all these things

45:33.236 --> 45:37.471
that came before us and made
this world possible, those

45:37.573 --> 45:42.276
chance events,
those planetary systems
that allow our little

45:42.378 --> 45:46.614
moat dust
survivve in a sunbeam.

45:51.154 --> 45:57.458
You, me and everyone we know,
we're lucky, lucky to get as

45:58.227 --> 46:01.929
far as we have and
lucky to be here now.

46:07.937 --> 46:09.970
But this is not the
end of the story.

46:10.072 --> 46:12.473
What's up?
How are you doing?

46:13.342 --> 46:16.977
Next time how all life
on Earth got started.

46:19.148 --> 46:23.617
And let me tell you,
that takes strange to
a whole new level.
