00:01.460 --> 00:04.838
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:04.922 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:12.095
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:12.179 --> 00:14.932
On which we used to rely?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.893
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.435 --> 00:21.605
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.232
All the things that make us

00:23.357 --> 00:24.816
Laugh and cry

00:24.900 --> 00:30.322
He's a family guy

00:34.618 --> 00:36.954
Peter, this game night was a great idea.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.122
Yeah, this will be a lot more fun
than last Saturday...

00:39.248 --> 00:41.208
when we went to see
The Vagina Monologues.

00:41.291 --> 00:45.420
So, in international news,
no luck yet finding Osama bin Laden.

00:45.504 --> 00:49.424
So the government is trying a new tactic.
They've hired Jeff Gillooly.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.551
[Audience member coughing]

00:50.634 --> 00:51.885
Gillooly.

[Man clearing throat]

00:53.303 --> 00:58.058
Sorry, I guess that joke was not so fresh,
but you know...

01:00.686 --> 01:02.604
Okay, Joe. Right foot, green.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.773
All right, let's do it!

01:04.940 --> 01:07.317
Yes! I am the king!

01:07.401 --> 01:10.404
Thanks for including
my civil rights board game...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.739
in the game night rotation, guys.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.576
We're always happy to play
Two Decades of Dignity.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.120
It makes us all feel a little less guilty.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.250
For whistling at a white woman,
go directly to jail.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.377
Man, does anyone ever win at this game?

01:25.544 --> 01:29.339
You don't win.
You just do a little better each time.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.010
Okay, everybody, time for paintball.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.469
I forgot to pick up the paintball guns.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.848
Well, we could use these.
I brought them from the office.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.894
Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns
at each other in the house?

01:41.977 --> 01:45.314
All right, all right, nobody fire at Lois.
She's scared.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.732
All right, one, two, three, go!

01:47.774 --> 01:50.194
[Guns firing]

01:52.112 --> 01:53.447
[All exclaiming]

01:59.077 --> 02:00.621
Missed, you ass.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.124
-Damn it, Peter, that hurt.
-Relax, Quagmire.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.169
You're doing better than Peter Weller
from the opening scene of RoboCop.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.425
Well, now that the mess is cleaned up and
we're back from the emergency room...

02:13.550 --> 02:16.220
it's time for the last game of the night,
Trivial Pursuit.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.765
Man, I hate Trivial Pursuit.
Always makes me feel so stupid.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.851
More stupid than that time
you locked your keys out of the car?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.019
Damn it!

02:24.228 --> 02:27.940
Hey! Hey! Somebody! Hey!

02:28.065 --> 02:30.984
Hey, sir! Sir, you see
those keys there? Sir!

02:31.109 --> 02:32.611
Oh, screw you!

02:42.037 --> 02:43.497
All right, Brian, this one's for you.

02:43.664 --> 02:48.210
"What naturally occurring element has
the highest melting point of all metals?"

02:48.293 --> 02:50.796
-Cadmium?
-Sorry, tungsten.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.422
Dumb ass. My turn. What do you got?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.884
Okay, here we go.
"What color is a fire truck?"

02:56.468 --> 02:58.095
Oh, God, I always get these.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.514
Okay, all right, fire truck.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.349
Fire truck, fire truck,
fire truck, fire truck,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.269
what color are those red fire trucks?

03:05.561 --> 03:08.021
Oh, God, I can picture them now,
all red and everything.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.357
That's right, Peter, they are red.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.567
Lois, what are you doing?

03:11.650 --> 03:14.319
[Whispering] I switched Peter's questions
to the pre-school edition.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.904
Just to let him have his moment.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.700
Good thing I just watched that National
Geographic special on fire trucks.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.453
NARRATOR: A solitary killer,
the fire truck stalks its prey.

03:40.470 --> 03:44.016
The fire truck can consume
eight times its body weight.

[Horn blaring]

03:47.186 --> 03:49.771
NARRATOR: The ambulances
will have to wait their turn.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.901
Okay, Brian, "Name the 16th century
ecumenical body...

03:54.026 --> 03:57.029
"that marked a major turning point
for Christianity in Europe."

03:57.154 --> 03:59.323
I think that was the Council of Trent.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.951
You could not be more wrong.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.494
The answer is Phyllis Diller.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.622
-Peter, you're reading the pink--
-My turn.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.916
Okay, Peter, this is for the win.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.251
"Say the word 'what.'"

04:13.587 --> 04:15.464
Wow. Okay.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.343
This really separates the men
from the boys.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.389
Peter, just say "what."

04:24.473 --> 04:28.560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, now, Lois.
This is not a race.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.396
Okay, I wanna say "who."

04:32.856 --> 04:34.566
Oh, boy.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.276
Fantastic Four.

04:36.652 --> 04:41.740
Fantastic Four, steak, steak, steak,
steak, a small amount of peas.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.117
Is it "what?"

04:44.201 --> 04:46.870
That's right. You win, Peter. You did it.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.081
Oh, my God! I won. I won!

04:49.248 --> 04:51.124
My dad's smarter than your dad.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.795
-We have the same dad, idiot.
-Yeah, but mine's smarter.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.129
What a feeling.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.091
This is even better than that time
I met Timer the Cheese Guy.

has got up and went

Pardon me, sir. I live next door.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.274
It is 3:30 in the morning.
I am very tired.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.859
Look, a wagon wheel.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.151
What the hell is your problem?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.945
I just smoked a whole bunch of crack.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.864
Good night, losers.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.283
Well, game night was a success.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.244
Peter, you do know that all your questions
were incredibly easy.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.247
Yeah, easy for me. Good night, morons.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.166
You ever stop and think,
"Wow, I'm married to that guy"?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.668
No, I just repress it.

Oh, oh, oh, I'm a tumor

05:47.723 --> 05:51.393
The administration's plan for peace in
the Middle East is shallow and pedantic.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.354
I agree. Shallow and pedantic.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.316
I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.528
Everything all right. Peter?

06:01.653 --> 06:05.240
Well, Lois, since you asked, I find
this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.326
What is this,
you're gonna talk down to everyone...

06:07.409 --> 06:09.203
just because you won a game
of Trivial Pursuit?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.412
Perhaps.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.748
Okay, you know what?
Fine, you are a genius, Peter.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.374
As a matter of fact,
let's make it official.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.418
You ever heard
of the MacArthur genius grant?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.586
Perhaps.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.338
Well, if you qualify as a genius...

06:19.421 --> 06:21.882
the Foundation will give you
a $500,000 grant...

06:21.965 --> 06:23.592
just to sit around
and do whatever you want.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.471
Wow! Imagine what a genius like me
could do with all that money.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.098
All right, Cloris Leachman,
I've bought you legally.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.475
Now juggle these beanbags.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.851

Well, here they are, Brian.
My test results. Read them and weep.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.215
Peter, according to this,
you're not a genius.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.342
In fact, you're mentally retarded.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.970
Oh, yeah?
Well, would a mentally retarded guy...

07:08.053 --> 07:11.139
have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver
to level half of his house...

07:11.223 --> 07:13.517
in celebration
of his fantastic test results?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.018
Maybe.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.144
Uh-oh.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.731
Congratulations.

07:26.864 --> 07:30.242
So, as you can see, you are just
over the line of mental retardation.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.743
Don't you mean, just under the line?

07:31.827 --> 07:33.745
The day I'm corrected by a...

That's right, senior prom.
Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.676
So, listen.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.678
I just found out I'm retarded.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.973
And I'm just calling to let you know...

07:53.891 --> 07:56.143
you might want to get yourself tested.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.854
Hello?

07:59.104 --> 08:01.940
Peter, mental retardation usually happens
before you're born.

08:02.024 --> 08:05.194
It isn't something you can catch.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

08:05.277 --> 08:07.613
Well, excuse me for being retarded.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.781
My whole world
has been turned upside down.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.366
Black is east, up is white.

08:11.450 --> 08:15.621
You know, Peter, I hate to say "I told you
so" about not being a genius, but...

08:15.704 --> 08:19.625
yeah! In your fucking face, fuck wad.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.337
I'm sorry about that.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.090
I can't believe this is happening to me.
I can never go back to school again.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.592
Oh, yes, Meg, yes.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.969
Yes, everything was going
swimmingly for you until this.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.972
Yes, this is the thing
that will ruin your reputation.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.601
Not your years of grotesque appearance
or awkward social graces...

08:37.684 --> 08:40.395
or that Felix Unger-ish way
you clear your sinuses.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.813
No, no, no, it's this.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.566
Do you hear yourself talk?
I might kill you tonight.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.693
Peter, you're still you.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.820
No piece of paper from the city
is gonna tell me...

08:48.904 --> 08:51.156
you're any different
from the man I married.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.991
And your life's not gonna change
because of it.

[Clanking]

08:54.201 --> 08:55.202
What is that?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.164
Oh, my God, what are they doing?

08:59.248 --> 09:02.125
Why are they trying
to publicly humiliate me like this?

09:02.209 --> 09:04.962
I mean, what's the purpose...
Shiny red ball.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.422
Peter, watch out!

09:10.551 --> 09:11.844
So what can I do for you, Peter?

09:11.927 --> 09:14.805
Well, Joe, I need to talk to you
about something kind of personal.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.765
-Shoot.
-Well, you know, I took this test...

09:16.849 --> 09:21.353
and it sort of turns out
that I'm technically mentally retarded.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.314
And, you know, I just wanted to ask...

09:24.439 --> 09:26.441
you know, how do you deal with it?

09:26.567 --> 09:29.194
-Deal with what?
-You know, with being retarded.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.655
Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.240
Now you're just splitting hairs.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.035
Griffin. Party of two.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.371
Mr. Griffin, we've been expecting you.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.291
Peter, relax. It's for liability reasons.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.209
Now, let's just try to enjoy our meal.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.545
I kind of get the helmet.
But what's with the water wings?

09:46.628 --> 09:47.963
Well, you did order the soup.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.132
Like something could happen...

09:50.215 --> 09:54.136
Get me out!

09:55.846 --> 09:58.140
These water wings didn't help at all.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.976
This is the worst day of my life.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.687
Now, there are plenty of people
who have had worse days.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.943
A parking ticket. I was gone five minutes.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.280
How could this day get any worse?

10:15.157 --> 10:17.367
Oh, my God.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.954
Oh, no!

10:22.998 --> 10:26.168
I wish I could just close my eyes
and make all this go away.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.920
Peter, look out!

10:28.420 --> 10:29.588
Holy crap!

10:30.297 --> 10:31.340
Oh, my God!

10:31.423 --> 10:32.799
Mr. Tucker, are you all right?

10:32.883 --> 10:36.178
Do I look like I'm all right?
My back is broken and my leg is twisted!

10:36.261 --> 10:38.514
Oh, my God! Your hooker's dead.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.974
Well, she was already dead,
but that doesn't excuse...

10:41.058 --> 10:43.352
Wait a minute.
You're Peter Griffin, the retarded fellow.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.437
-Yeah.
-Well, then don't worry about it.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.023
Wait a minute. You mean
you're not even gonna call the cops?

10:48.106 --> 10:51.401
Oh, my God.
I could get away with anything.

10:52.778 --> 10:55.447
"And on the sixth day, God said:

11:11.338 --> 11:13.465
Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago?
I'm retarded.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.717
You're just curious.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.387
Well, let me show you
how everything works down there.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.349
Hey, everyone.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.936
Say hello to my state-appointed
inspirational social worker, Vern.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.437
It's truly a pleasure to meet you all.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.941
Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself
one super family.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.527
High five! All right!

11:35.445 --> 11:38.615
So, Vern, what exactly is it that you do?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.410
I'm here to lend a hand
to my main man, Peter.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.786
-Right, Peter?
-Right.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.289
High five! All right!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.374
Done.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.918
-Peter!
-What? I don't know any better.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.670
Peter, I don't like this.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.548
You are really starting to take advantage
of this whole situation.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.425
Peter's just expressing himself.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.427
High five for expressing yourself, Peter.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.345
High five! All right!

12:02.806 --> 12:06.268
This man seems bent on diluting
the already watered-down significance...

12:06.351 --> 12:07.686
of the elevated hand slap.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.771
-Hey, Stewie, high five.
-Well, it's about time.

12:09.855 --> 12:10.939
-Psych.
-Damn!

12:11.023 --> 12:13.775
I look even more foolish
than when I was at that cocktail party.

12:13.984 --> 12:17.112
All right, you're gonna love this. So...
Hang on a sec.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.046
Okay, so these two black guys
walk into a bar, and the bartender looks--

12:34.129 --> 12:35.214
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

12:35.297 --> 12:37.216
I was just telling a joke.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.677
So, the bartender looks around and says:

12:40.844 --> 12:43.347
"What'll you two fine gentlemen have?"

12:43.430 --> 12:47.851
And they paid their tab
and couldn't have been more courteous.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.898
All right, my first trip to a fast-food
joint as a retarded guy.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.317
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through.
Special needs.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.986
Yeah, I'll have a... Is this thing on?

12:58.654 --> 13:02.950
Attention, restaurant customers.
Testicles. That is all.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.201
Give me that.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.539
Sorry, folks. Oh, my God.
Is that what my voice sounds like?

13:08.705 --> 13:11.500
It's all whiney and nasally.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.377
You know what?
I'm just gonna get my own food.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.463
-Peter, get back here.
-No freaking way.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.800
The fryolator. I am so taking this.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.761
[Lois screaming]

13:23.887 --> 13:26.890
Lois, you look worse than
that Rocky Dennis kid from Mask.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.351
Rocky, I don't even know
what you look like.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.479
-Can I touch your face?
-Of course, Diana.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.189
Oh, God.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.192
Oh, God. What is this?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.028
What is all this?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.573
Am I touching the outside of a house?

13:42.698 --> 13:45.534
Oh, God! You're a monster.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.244
I'm beautiful on the inside.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.496
Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit.

13:50.831 --> 13:54.376
What is this now?
Does your face have a pelvis?

13:56.170 --> 13:59.256
Oh, God, what have I done?
I'm the worst husband ever.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.091
Make that the worst father ever.

14:01.175 --> 14:04.344
Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services.
I'm here to take your kids away.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.512
What? Why?

14:05.596 --> 14:08.015
Because you're mentally unfit
to take care of them.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.099
No way!

14:09.183 --> 14:10.350
-Oh, my God.
-Finally.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.150
I can't believe they took the kids away.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.485
Well, at least Cleveland offered
to take care of them.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.617
Sorry you have to share a bed, boys.
I'm a little short on space.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.285
Have a good sleep.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.704
Hey, Chris...

14:31.038 --> 14:32.998
whatever happened to Geena Davis?

14:33.207 --> 14:36.543
She used to be in movies,
but she's not in movies anymore.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.003
She's attractive enough...

14:38.086 --> 14:40.631
but when she smiles,
you see too much gum.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.050
Not a good tooth-to-gum ratio.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.052
Chris?

14:45.719 --> 14:47.554
I'll tell you tomorrow.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.849
Thanks for letting my friends sleep over,
Mr. Brown.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.100
No problem, Meg.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.729
If y'all get hungry,
there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.

14:55.812 --> 14:59.441
I'm gonna get me a spoonful now
before y'all have at it.

14:59.525 --> 15:02.319
Oh, my God.
Craig Hoffman's new car is so cool.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.488
Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.073
Really? What color is it?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.991
It's like blue, kind of blue-green.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.285
It's the same color as his eyes.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.330
Wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.831
I heard he bought it from his dad.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.334
Yeah, I remember his dad
dropped him off at school in it...

15:17.417 --> 15:18.919
one time when he was a freshman.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.088
-Doesn't his dad live in Hartford?
-I think so.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.548
My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.467
They have a mall there that's pretty cool.
It's part underground.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.010
That's awesome.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.012
Damn it, you guys are boring
the crap out of me.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.139
It's stupid, mindless chatter,
is what it is.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.266
You know what I'm gonna do?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.726
I'm just gonna go back to my place
and rent a dirty movie.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.645
This is ridiculous.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.440
That was weird. Oh, well.
Hey, let's compare breasts.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.945
Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey?

15:45.070 --> 15:47.281
Listen, there's no toilet paper
in the bathroom...

15:47.364 --> 15:48.907
so, I'm just gonna...

15:49.449 --> 15:50.450
There we go.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.704
[Toilet flushing]

15:53.787 --> 15:56.456
Oh, God. Hang on!

15:56.540 --> 15:59.459
The doctors still don't know how
much longer she's gonna have to be here.

15:59.585 --> 16:00.836
I feel horrible, Brian.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.672
I put Lois in the hospital, and I lost the
kids.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.466
This is turning out worse
than Stewie's iPod commercial.

16:06.592 --> 16:09.761
[Singing] Shooting at
the walls of heartache

16:09.845 --> 16:11.054
Bang, bang

16:11.138 --> 16:14.016
I am the warrior

16:15.309 --> 16:18.103
Well, I am the warrior

16:18.187 --> 16:20.397
Peter, you just need to show
what a good father you are.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.232
Then you can get
the kids back from Cleveland.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.193
Wait a second, Brian. You're right.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.946
And the best way to do that is to show
what a terrible father Cleveland is.

16:28.030 --> 16:31.116
This plan is so perfect, it's retarded.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.913
Good evening. I'm Dan Rather.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.457
And tonight on CBS News...

16:38.540 --> 16:41.001
seven Saudi soldiers sodomize...

16:41.084 --> 16:45.339
several of Saddam's
southern settlement squatters.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.633
[Whistling]

16:53.222 --> 16:54.348
I'm Dan Rather.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.850
All right, come on, ladies.
Right this way.

16:56.934 --> 16:59.311
This'll show them
that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.439
So, tell me, is there any tread left
on the tires at all?

17:02.523 --> 17:05.817
Or at this point, would it be like
throwing a hot dog down a hallway?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.778
Oh, my Lord. Look who's here.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.572
Agent Jessup,
look at all these prostitutes.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.784
[Singing] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven

17:13.992 --> 17:16.203
Seven. Seven prostitutes.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.829
This is a shakedown.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.665
Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work.

17:19.748 --> 17:23.126
Yeah. Peter, you and five
of those prostitutes, get out.

17:25.337 --> 17:29.216
So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin,
you've inspired me...

17:29.466 --> 17:31.718
to distrust
all mentally challenged parents.

17:31.802 --> 17:32.845
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:32.928 --> 17:36.348
And thank you, Agent Jessup,
for your comically misleading remarks.

17:36.431 --> 17:39.434
Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say
in your defense...

17:39.518 --> 17:42.604
as to why this court should return custody
of your children to you?

17:42.688 --> 17:45.691
Your Honor, I would like to call
to the stand my surprise witness...

17:45.774 --> 17:47.776
The Ghost That Never Lies.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.570
[Exclaiming in surprise]

17:49.653 --> 17:51.613
But I'm the only one
who can see him and hear him...

17:51.697 --> 17:53.740
so I'll let everyone know
what he's saying and doing.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.993
Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.786
Overruled. I'll allow it.

17:57.870 --> 18:00.414
You better be going somewhere
with this, Mr. Griffin.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.748
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.500
Ghost That Never Lies...

18:03.584 --> 18:06.920
did you witness the events
that took place on that fateful day?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.590
You did? Well, how interesting.

18:09.798 --> 18:13.635
And, do you see the culprit or culprits
in this courtroom today?

18:13.844 --> 18:15.053
You do?

18:15.429 --> 18:19.183
Well, would you kindly
point him or them out for this court?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.393
Don't point at me, you jackass!

18:21.476 --> 18:24.229
Well, if there's nothing further,
I hereby sentence--

18:24.313 --> 18:26.940
Wait, wait, wait.
Your Honor, there is something further.

18:27.024 --> 18:29.276
Look, I know I screwed up big time.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.653
But I only did it
so I could get my kids back.

18:31.737 --> 18:32.738
I love them.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.282
And I think it's a bum rap
that just because I'm retarded...

18:35.365 --> 18:36.825
that makes me an unfit parent.

18:36.909 --> 18:39.745
There are plenty of unfit parents
out there who aren't retarded...

18:39.828 --> 18:40.954
but they get to keep their kids.

18:41.038 --> 18:44.833
Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford.
I think the Ramseys still got one left.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.128
I just want them back, Your Honor,
and you're the only one who can help me.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.213
What do you say?

18:49.296 --> 18:51.256
Are you kidding? You're a monster.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.133
In fact, if I could...

18:53.342 --> 18:57.137
I would put you in a place where you
would be removed from the general public.

18:57.221 --> 19:00.599
Perhaps locked in a big, secure building
with other dangerous people...

19:00.682 --> 19:02.601
for a pre-determined period of time...

19:02.684 --> 19:04.978
based on the nature and degree
of your offense.

19:05.062 --> 19:08.023
Unfortunately, as far as I know,
no such place exists.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.776
So I have no choice but to set you free.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.236
Does that mean I get my kids back?

19:12.319 --> 19:14.279
Absolutely not. Case closed.

19:14.363 --> 19:15.405
Oh, crap!

19:15.822 --> 19:17.991
It was prison you were
thinking of. Prison.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.701
I already banged the hammer.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.248
MAN: [On TV] And now,
back to Jake and the Fatman.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.376
Hey, look over here on the carpet.
That's a cigarette butt.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.503
This is probably evidence.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.092
What do you think was in that Danish?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.178
You think it was cheese?

19:39.388 --> 19:42.015
'Cause I got a little problem with cheese.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.018
Hey, I'm talking about evidence here.
There's lipstick on it.

19:45.102 --> 19:48.230
Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.774
I can't move it. This is a crime scene.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.611
Well, can you describe it to me?

19:54.778 --> 19:56.905
You know what? Forget it.
I'll take care of this, okay?

19:56.989 --> 20:00.367
Oh, no. Just...

20:03.871 --> 20:05.539
Just let me close my eyes for a minute.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.875
Look, I know his wife is a smoker.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.294
Just yesterday,
when we saw her at the country club...

20:10.377 --> 20:12.963
she had a cigarette in her hand.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.048
[Snoring]

20:17.968 --> 20:20.095
What, so that's it, Peter?
You're just giving up?

20:20.179 --> 20:21.722
I don't know what else to do, Brian.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.891
I guess we're never
gonna be a family again.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.226
-Hi, Peter.
-Oh, my God, Lois.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.853
-You're all better.
-That's right.

20:27.978 --> 20:31.273
And the doctors say I'll smell like
French fries for the next six months.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.357
I'll enjoy that.

20:32.441 --> 20:35.068
And, Peter, I got a surprise for you.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.236
You got the kids back.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.907
I love you so much,
delicious French-fry wife.

20:39.990 --> 20:43.452
Now we can live with you again
even though you're a dangerous retard.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.955
Don't say "retard," Chris.
We prefer to be called "little people."

20:47.039 --> 20:49.708
Because there's nothing wrong
with being mentally challenged.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.544
In fact, I've learned
that we are superior people.

20:52.628 --> 20:54.963
Above all you dumb brainy smarties.

20:55.047 --> 20:58.425
Someday, you will beg us for mercy
and we will consider it.

20:58.509 --> 21:01.803
Isn't it wonderful
that everything's back to normal?

21:01.887 --> 21:02.888
Yeah.

21:03.055 --> 21:04.681
Oh, God. Nobody move.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.309
-What is it?
-Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it.
