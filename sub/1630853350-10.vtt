He's gone.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.945
[whimpering]

13:46.326 --> 13:50.247
[whimpering]

13:56.962 --> 13:58.838
[siren wails in distance]

13:58.922 --> 14:00.340
Nobody should die alone.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.762
[sighs]

14:05.845 --> 14:07.264
It's now a homicide scene.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.977
We need to back out
and call in the detectives.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.791
I got two great seats for the game.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.128
Cost me an arm and a leg,
but it's gonna be completely worth it.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.462
I tell you.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.630
Gustafson, I need a word.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.133
I'll catch up.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.679
Bosch, I'm getting tired
of seeing your face.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.306
I'm getting tired of doing your job.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.436
What is it?

14:54.519 --> 14:55.687
A way to close the Basu case.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.605
The right way.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.691
What's on it?

14:59.774 --> 15:02.319
Dr. Vincent Shipman
works at Basu's clinic.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.237
-You talk to him?
-Didn't need to.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.949
He was using it
as a prescription mill,

15:08.033 --> 15:11.953
writing phony scripts for the homeless
and selling the pills himself.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.079
Basu confronted him about it.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.081
Two hours later,
Basu was stabbed to death

15:15.165 --> 15:16.166
with surgical precision.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.376
And it's all on that?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.212
I got a video of Shipman
laying the drugs off to a buyer.

15:21.296 --> 15:25.050
The rest you can get from the autopsy
and a subpoena of Basu's records.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.470
You put the package together,
you bring Shipman in, you lay it out.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.263
That easy, huh?

15:30.347 --> 15:32.641
Look, if I had a badge,

15:32.724 --> 15:35.810
I'd also get a cell phone dump
around the area where the murder occurred.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.563
My guess is Shipman's cell
is gonna be on it.

15:38.647 --> 15:42.442
So you put it together,
I think he'll confess.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.403
And you won't even have to take
your jacket off or get in his face.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.366
What do you want in return?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.909
I want you to do the right thing.

15:50.992 --> 15:54.412
I want you to arrest the right guy
and put him in fuckin' jail.

15:54.496 --> 15:59.000
And if you can't do it,
I still know people on the job that can.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.178
[phone vibrates]

16:11.179 --> 16:12.013
Mo.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.973
[Mo]
I found something.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.434
There's a hidden camera on
the delivery door of that place downtown.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.061
Probably to catch package pirates.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.272
I found it on the building's Wi-Fi network
and I backed up the image.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.483
You're gonna wanna see it.

16:23.566 --> 16:24.693
Send it to me.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.986
I just did. Brace yourself.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.913
It's Sloan. Here for a security check.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.540
[Vibiana]
Okay, hang on.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.250
[door buzzes]

[tires screech]

17:55.742 --> 17:56.951
All right. Crash, crash.

18:00.622 --> 18:06.377
[all screaming]

18:06.461 --> 18:07.378
Get on the ground!

18:07.462 --> 18:11.883
[all screaming]

18:13.760 --> 18:15.428
That's him. Fuckin' bag him.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.513
-[speaking Arabic]
-Shut the fuck up.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.014
Let's go, shitbird.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.682
Let's go, boys. Load 'em up.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

18:33.530 --> 18:36.533
-Crips, take these fuckers for me.
-[speaking Arabic]

18:39.869 --> 18:42.163
Crips, you got lead.
Take us back, brother.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.582
Roger that.
Let's go, boys. Load up.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.918
-We're good.
-Let's go, let's go.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.045
Let's go, guys. Let's go.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.129
Let's go.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.352
[suspenseful music playing]

19:12.819 --> 19:13.862
Put him in 19.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.082
Sit down and shut the fuck up.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.709
[speaking Arabic]

19:33.214 --> 19:34.591
You got him?

19:34.674 --> 19:36.801
Yeah, I got him.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.011
I'll go see what's what.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.268
Edge.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.647
He's Saudi.
Your guy speak Arabic?

19:49.731 --> 19:51.816
He speaks whatever we need.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.944
We didn't find any intel in the cave.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.113
We'll just have to see
what he's got to say.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.741
Okay, what's your angle?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.993
I'm gonna ask him to give it all up.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.037
And he will.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.581
You sure about that?
These guys come rough.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.707
Fuck that.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.754
I'm gonna paint a picture of all
the nightmare shit that I can do to him

20:12.837 --> 20:15.715
and then I'm gonna let him
gestate on that until he's chatty.

20:15.798 --> 20:16.716
If he's not chatty?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
Then all the bad shit I mentioned
will start to happen.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.391
And you'll have to shoot him.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.434
To quiet him down.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.352
Yeah, so what do you do?

20:27.435 --> 20:29.938
You cross your fuckin' fingers

20:30.021 --> 20:33.149
and hope that he's not just
giving you whatever you wanna hear?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.110
'Cause bad intel
gets the wrong people killed.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.034
This is my world, Sergeant.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.621
So why don't you go
back out there to yours

20:46.704 --> 20:50.625
and do what you do best,
which I believe is... kill people.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.630
[Creighton grunting]

21:07.183 --> 21:08.184
[grunts]

21:10.269 --> 21:11.104
[gasps]

21:11.187 --> 21:15.316
Bosch. The hell is this? Where am I?

21:17.235 --> 21:21.531
Oh, Jesus. [panting]

21:23.741 --> 21:26.411
Help me! Somebody help me!

21:26.494 --> 21:30.039
No one can hear you.
It's her building.

21:30.123 --> 21:30.957
Whose?

21:31.040 --> 21:34.836
The one you sent the assassin to
because the place was empty.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.130
That everybody had been evicted from
except for her and her son.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.507
Listen, Bosch,
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:39.590 --> 21:43.553
This is wrong. You're not that guy.
You'll go to prison for this.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.891
I am that guy.
If I go, you'll go.

21:50.143 --> 21:55.023
It'll all come out. You set loose a killer
on a 14-year-old boy and his mother.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.358
The only thing I'll be guilty of
is trying to stop it.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.943
This is crazy.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.487
I'm an ex-cop, for God's sake.

22:01.571 --> 22:02.405
A commander!

22:03.865 --> 22:04.866
[grunts]

22:06.743 --> 22:08.327
-Who is she?
-Bosch, I don't know.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.954
Don't fuck with me. Who is she?

22:10.038 --> 22:13.041
How can I tell you
something that I don't know?

22:15.918 --> 22:17.128
[grunts]

22:17.211 --> 22:21.632
[grunts] Oh, shit.
Oh, Bosch, don't, please.

22:21.716 --> 22:25.011
I can't tell you
something that I don't know.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.140
[Bosch]
You had me checked out.

22:29.223 --> 22:32.143
Tora Bora.
You know what we did there.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.687
You don't wanna do this.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.522
Don't do this. Don't do this.
Bosch, no, don't.

22:36.606 --> 22:40.693
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't!
I don't know her name! Okay?

22:40.777 --> 22:44.739
All I have is a contact.
No names.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.908
I don't even know where she's from.

22:46.991 --> 22:47.950
How was contact made?

22:48.034 --> 22:51.370
Text. I have a number.
I use a burner.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.123
The money's sent to a-- a blind account
in the Caymans.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.750
Then you can get a message to her.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.918
Yes.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.628
Tell her to stop.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.797
Can't. Her rules.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.216
When she takes the job,
there's no turning back.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.427
What did she do with Sloan?

23:06.511 --> 23:10.556
Dead and buried, I assume.
She's a pro.

23:11.682 --> 23:12.642
Everyone disappears.

23:13.643 --> 23:14.977
Where's the burner?

23:15.061 --> 23:16.187
My briefcase.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.814
[grunts]

23:17.897 --> 23:18.773
What's the combination?

23:18.856 --> 23:19.899
Two-one-three.

23:40.628 --> 23:45.007
Tell her Vibiana and her son are at
Vance's country house in Hidden Valley.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.884
How'd you know about that place?

23:48.469 --> 23:49.971
Sloan.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.183
She won't believe it, Bosch.
She'll smell a set-up.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.393
Then you'll have to convince her.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.605
Call your people,
tell 'em to get the drone up.

23:59.689 --> 24:00.940
I'll tell you what to say.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.276
You go off-script,
I'll put you on your back again.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.612
[Creighton sighs]

24:12.076 --> 24:13.744
[phone vibrates]

[suspenseful music playing]

25:09.967 --> 25:11.969
[indistinct chatter]

25:22.355 --> 25:23.564
What do you want?

25:23.648 --> 25:24.649
For you to watch this.

25:24.732 --> 25:25.608
Get out of the booth. I'm leaving.

25:25.691 --> 25:26.525
Pay attention.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.862
This is what happens after the shooting
and Nicole is dead.

25:29.946 --> 25:30.821
I said, get out of the booth.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.950
The gun was planted
and I can prove it.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.414
Play it.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.335
[Chandler]
Okay, right there.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.546
That officer is telling Cosgrove
the gun was in the trunk,

25:47.630 --> 25:49.173
not where the driver could reach it.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.593
Cosgrove then tells
the two patrol officers,

25:52.677 --> 25:55.221
Vasquez and Bosch,
to set up crime scene tape.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.848
That was to get their backs turned
to what's about to go down.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.183
Maybe.

25:59.267 --> 26:02.812
Cosgrove turns back to the trunk
where the gun is.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.731
The two officers turn back
to their vehicle to get the tape,

26:05.815 --> 26:08.234
and as they do,
Cosgrove reaches into the trunk.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.568
His shoulder dips.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.488
He grabs the gun,

26:12.571 --> 26:15.449
moves it around to the front of the car
underneath the driver's seat.

26:18.202 --> 26:21.539
Nicole told her mother that
after shooting Officer Calderon,

26:21.622 --> 26:23.082
Sharp put the gun in the trunk.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.668
And we know you have
that conversation on tape.

26:34.802 --> 26:38.431
So... will you do the right thing?

26:42.810 --> 26:45.521
[Mo] Now, if you wanna set a perimeter,
these cameras are good.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.066
They use 'em to pick up mountain lions
and other critters in the woods at night.

26:49.150 --> 26:53.529
Top-of-the-line ClearVision,
crystal HD at 12 MPs.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.072
Now in English.

26:55.156 --> 26:59.535
[chuckles] High-density night vision,
12-megapixel crystal imaging.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.245
And it'll relay to your phone.

27:01.329 --> 27:04.248
Just make sure you got
your Bluetooth switched on.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.839
Bluetooth...

27:11.922 --> 27:13.758
[chuckles]

27:21.891 --> 27:22.725
Thanks.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.977
[beer opens]

27:25.061 --> 27:26.187
What about him?

27:26.270 --> 27:29.065
That's a garden gnome
with a wide-angle lens.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.066
I call him Harry.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.359
Very funny.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.612
How about playback on the speaker?

27:34.695 --> 27:36.364
Also controlled from your phone.

27:36.447 --> 27:38.783
And these right here
are powerful speakers.

27:38.866 --> 27:39.867
Just tap and play.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.037
Uh, Harry...

27:43.120 --> 27:44.747
That woman with the suppressor...

27:45.831 --> 27:48.000
Why don't you just call the cops
and let them handle it?

27:48.084 --> 27:50.127
They move too slow,
if they move it all.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.296
Then what's your plan?

27:52.380 --> 27:53.255
Off the record.

27:53.339 --> 27:57.259
I'll give her every opportunity
to give it up and stand down.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.178
And if she doesn't?

28:02.640 --> 28:04.100
I'm gonna protect my clients.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.066
Then, uh... you need some backup?

28:16.695 --> 28:17.613
Appreciate the offer.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.076
But this is my war.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.160
[phone vibrates]

28:26.705 --> 28:27.998
You calling about the arrest?

28:28.082 --> 28:28.916
What arrest?

28:28.999 --> 28:31.419
For the murder of Dr. Basu.
It's on the news.

28:31.502 --> 28:32.336
Who?

28:32.420 --> 28:35.131
A doctor who worked with Basu
at his clinic.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.049
Jeffrey Herstadt is no longer a suspect.

28:38.509 --> 28:39.760
I hadn't heard. Good.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.220
You have something to do with it?

28:42.471 --> 28:45.724
Well, let's just say I gave Gustafson
the path to redemption.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.352
And he took it. Well done.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.689
So if you're not calling about that...

28:51.772 --> 28:54.650
I'm about to go do something
that could go sideways. If it does...

28:54.733 --> 28:55.818
Harry, what are you up to?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.236
Well, better you don't know.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.905
But if what you're doing is dangerous,
don't do it.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.615
Little late for that.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.415
[phone rings]

29:09.498 --> 29:11.333
[on voicemail] This is Harry Bosch.
Leave me a message.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.418
[beeps]

29:12.501 --> 29:17.089
Dad, guess who?
What, are you in WitSec?

29:17.173 --> 29:22.011
Call me back or I'll steal all
of your vinyl and I will sell it on eBay.

29:30.186 --> 29:31.395
[water running]

29:56.212 --> 29:57.213
[knocking on door]

30:00.424 --> 30:01.634
[water stops]

30:16.273 --> 30:18.275
Honey, what are you doing here?

30:18.359 --> 30:21.153
We need to talk. May I come in?

30:27.368 --> 30:29.662
Just got home.
It's kind of a mess.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.333
I won't keep you. [clears throat]

30:35.960 --> 30:37.044
You, uh...

30:38.045 --> 30:41.590
You know I'm representing
the son of the woman killed by the SIS.

30:42.591 --> 30:45.761
What I know is if you drag me into it,

30:45.844 --> 30:48.847
you could destroy my career
before it even starts.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.349
That's not going to happen.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.187
I'm not in this to destroy you
or anyone else.

30:56.814 --> 31:00.776
But what the police say happened
didn't happen.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.902
And I'm gonna prove it.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.326
Then you are gonna destroy careers.

31:11.954 --> 31:12.788
[sighs]

31:15.165 --> 31:17.376
I thought you cared about me.

31:17.459 --> 31:18.794
I do.

31:20.963 --> 31:21.964
Of course I do.

31:24.049 --> 31:27.219
But I also care deeply
about justice being served.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.805
Don't you?

31:34.476 --> 31:36.478
[crickets chirping]

32:04.506 --> 32:06.508
[phone vibrates]

32:09.928 --> 32:12.931
[suspenseful music playing]

33:31.719 --> 33:33.971
[phone vibrates]

34:06.044 --> 34:08.046
[suspenseful music playing]

34:08.130 --> 34:11.049
[Vibiana] "I understood that the lives
of all the honest men aboard

34:11.133 --> 34:14.011
depended upon me alone.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.930
Chapter 11.

34:17.014 --> 34:21.351
"No, not I," said Silver.

34:21.435 --> 34:25.481
"Flint was cap'n; I was quartermaster,
along of my timber leg.

34:25.564 --> 34:31.528
The same broadside I lost my leg,
old Pew lost his deadlights.

34:31.612 --> 34:37.618
It was a master surgeon, him that
ampytated me-- out of college and all--

34:37.701 --> 34:41.580
Latin by the bucket, and what not;
but he was hanged like a dog,

34:41.663 --> 34:45.209
and sun-dried like the rest,
at Corso Castle.

34:45.292 --> 34:50.839
That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed
of changing names to their ships--

34:50.923 --> 34:53.634
Royal Fortune and so on.

34:53.717 --> 34:58.013
Now, what a ship was christened,
so let her stay, I says.

34:58.096 --> 35:03.602
So it was the Cassandra,
as brought us safe home from Malabar,

35:03.685 --> 35:07.147
after England
took the viceroy of the Indies;

35:07.231 --> 35:11.443
so it was with the old Walrus,
Flint's old ship,

35:11.527 --> 35:15.781
that I've seen amuck with the red blood
and fit to sink with gold."

35:15.864 --> 35:18.450
"Ah!" cried another voice,

35:18.534 --> 35:22.454
the youngest hand on board,
and evidently full of admiration.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.957
"He was the flower of the flock,
was Flint!"

35:25.040 --> 35:28.460
"Davis was a man too, by all accounts,"
said Silver.

35:28.544 --> 35:32.589
"I never sailed along of him;
first with England, then with Flint,

35:32.673 --> 35:38.053
that's my story; and now here on
my own account, in a manner of speaking.

35:38.136 --> 35:43.559
I laid by nine hundred safe, from England,
and two thousand after Flint.

35:43.642 --> 35:48.272
That ain't bad for a man
before the mast-- all safe in the bank.

35:48.355 --> 35:52.860
'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it,
you may lay to that.

35:52.943 --> 35:57.698
Where's all England's men now?
I dunno. Where's Flint's?"

35:57.781 --> 35:59.449
You move, you die.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.660
[intense music playing]

36:22.014 --> 36:23.015
[gun clicks]

36:27.853 --> 36:29.855
[suspenseful music playing]

36:33.734 --> 36:37.029
Six shots.
You brought an old man's gun, Bosch.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.615
[groans]

36:55.714 --> 36:57.841
You should have counted guns.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.521
You're the boot.

37:11.605 --> 37:12.522
End of watch,

37:12.606 --> 37:15.859
just make sure you turn it in clean
like it's your own personal car.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.903
I don't have people
puking and shitting themselves

37:17.986 --> 37:19.988
in the back seat
of my personal car, Sarge.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.198
Not usually, anyway.

37:21.281 --> 37:22.950
True, but you get the point.

37:23.033 --> 37:24.368
Roger that, Mank.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.786
Sarge.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.372
[chuckles] Stay safe.
Say hi to your dad for me.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.666
-I will.
-Vasquez.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.168
You're late, boot.
What'd he want?

37:33.251 --> 37:36.380
Sorry. He was bending my ear
about keeping the Orca clean.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.131
PM watch complained.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.719
Man, I'd expect a little more care
and attention to detail

37:42.803 --> 37:45.263
from a boot who's getting
the keys for the first time.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.308
Really?

37:48.392 --> 37:49.977
Let's go before I change my mind.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.980
[chuckles] Wow.

37:55.816 --> 37:57.150
Press conference at City Hall?

37:57.234 --> 38:00.237
Yeah, at Grant Park.
I want Old Faithful behind me.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.196
[Ramirez]
Good optics.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.115
Holler when you need me.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.032
Okay.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.242
So you have it all sorted out?

38:05.325 --> 38:08.495
I hope so. We're taking it
over to the courthouse now.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.997
It'll be filed within the hour.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.581
Now, what about security?

38:11.665 --> 38:13.166
[Chandler]
Martin, we'll be fine.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.962
Detective Morrison.
We were just leaving.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.214
I'll give you the tape you want
on one condition.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.133
I'm listening.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.011
You don't use it just to get
a fast settlement from the city.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.722
You use it to force change
in the department.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.184
[exhales] You have my word.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.479
But you have to keep in mind
I represent a six-year-old boy

38:34.563 --> 38:36.773
whose mother was killed
at the hands of the police.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.193
I have to do what's best for my client.

38:46.199 --> 38:47.325
Okay.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.287
I'll deal with this. You need to go.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.872
Thank you.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.082
I hope I don't regret this.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.793
As do I.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.553
That's your mother
and your grandmother.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.888
Aren't they beautiful?

39:07.971 --> 39:10.307
Harry, you got it restored.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.642
I want one too.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.269
I'll get you one.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.437
Ready to go home?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.983
Oh, here's some sandwiches for the ride.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.526
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.695
-Will I see you tonight? [chuckles]
-Of course.

39:23.779 --> 39:26.490
Oh, I wanna see your work.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.574
[chuckles]

39:29.034 --> 39:30.327
My eviction exhibition.

39:30.410 --> 39:31.328
Ah, I see.

39:31.411 --> 39:33.997
If it's all clear,
I'm gonna open it tonight.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.082
I got those.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.628
[exhales] Harry...

39:41.546 --> 39:42.756
Take care of my family.

39:43.757 --> 39:44.591
I will.

39:44.674 --> 39:45.675
Thank you.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.429
[reporters clamoring]

39:49.513 --> 39:52.557
[Chandler] Today, I filed a petition
to determine administration

39:52.641 --> 39:53.725
of the Whitney Vance estate,

39:53.809 --> 39:57.687
which includes a majority ownership
of Advance Engineering.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.774
Mr. Vance did not die
without any heirs.

40:00.857 --> 40:03.026
He has a granddaughter
and a great-grandson,

40:03.110 --> 40:06.446
and we intend to prove it
through DNA analysis and other means

40:06.530 --> 40:08.031
at the hearing
in support of the motion.

40:08.115 --> 40:08.949
Jane and John Doe?

40:09.032 --> 40:11.326
Why aren't you naming
these so-called heirs?

40:11.409 --> 40:15.664
Well, I can think of a few billion reasons
not to put their names out there.

40:15.872 --> 40:19.084
People like you descending on them.
Others with their hands out.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.919
These are very private people,

40:21.002 --> 40:24.548
and there have already been
two attempts to find and eliminate them.

40:24.714 --> 40:25.841
Eliminate? By who?

40:25.924 --> 40:29.052
Everything you need to know
can be found in the petition.

40:29.136 --> 40:30.428
Read it.

40:30.512 --> 40:31.346
Thank you.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.932
And I'm sure I will see you all in court.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.227
[reporters clamoring]

40:44.901 --> 40:45.735
[engine shuts off]

40:45.819 --> 40:46.736
Hold on a second.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.384
I thought you said we were all clear.

41:11.094 --> 41:11.928
We are.

41:15.807 --> 41:16.766
Old habits, you know.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.561
[exhales]

41:21.855 --> 41:23.273
You promise to come back tonight?

41:23.356 --> 41:24.357
I will.

41:24.441 --> 41:27.277
Oh, and bring your daughter.
I'd like to meet her.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.778
I'll ask her.

41:31.698 --> 41:32.949
Then I won't say goodbye.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.120
But I will say thank you, Harry.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.248
For my son's life.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.709
For my life.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.045
For everything you've done.

41:46.546 --> 41:47.547
It's what I do.

41:49.633 --> 41:50.759
It was more.

41:54.304 --> 41:55.680
Do something good with it, Vibi.

41:57.557 --> 41:58.391
Make changes.

42:03.647 --> 42:04.814
I will.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.056
Car's outside. Keys are in it.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.393
What about her? Is she...

42:41.476 --> 42:43.270
She's gone.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.730
If she surfaces, it'll be with your gun.
You won't want that.

42:54.864 --> 43:00.120
You know, Bosch, we could use a man
with your skills at Trident.

43:00.203 --> 43:01.371
Someone who's willing
to cross the line.

43:01.454 --> 43:02.706
Fuck off.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.001
Fair enough.

43:15.844 --> 43:18.054
[door opens]

43:20.098 --> 43:21.641
Dad, did your phone run out of battery?

43:22.642 --> 43:26.771
[sighs] Sorry.
I was tying up loose ends.

43:26.855 --> 43:27.856
I got distracted.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.399
How was your day?

43:29.482 --> 43:31.151
It was good.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.402
Long.

43:34.863 --> 43:35.697
Cold beer?

43:35.780 --> 43:37.365
Comin' up.

43:40.118 --> 43:40.952
Where's Coltrane?

43:41.036 --> 43:44.748
Oh, he's having a sleepover at Sam's.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.207
Dog's life.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.962
So I, uh, I got to drive today.

43:51.046 --> 43:51.921
[beer opens]

43:52.005 --> 43:54.674
Oh, yeah? How was that?

43:56.634 --> 43:59.763
I would be lying if I didn't say it was
one of the cooler moments of my life.

43:59.846 --> 44:00.680
[chuckles]

44:02.432 --> 44:03.975
Training wheels come off.

44:04.059 --> 44:05.602
I remember it well.

44:05.685 --> 44:07.312
I'm proud of you, Mads.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.647
This cop thing could work out.

44:09.731 --> 44:10.648
Hmm. You think?

44:12.650 --> 44:13.651
Yeah.

44:14.861 --> 44:15.695
Dad...

44:19.616 --> 44:20.450
What is it, honey?

44:21.701 --> 44:22.702
Hmm?

44:26.581 --> 44:27.540
I just want you to know.

44:30.585 --> 44:36.049
When I can't reach you,
it scares me.

44:38.134 --> 44:39.511
A lot.

44:41.304 --> 44:43.556
Because I'm-I'm out there
and I'm on the street

44:43.640 --> 44:48.853
and I see all of the bad shit
that goes on.

44:54.484 --> 44:56.736
And it just...
it gets in your head, you know?

44:58.655 --> 45:00.573
I do.

45:01.783 --> 45:06.454
And I'm trying to-to stay rational
so that I can do this job

45:06.538 --> 45:10.583
because I think I love it.

45:12.919 --> 45:13.753
I get it.

45:13.837 --> 45:15.171
I know you do.

45:15.255 --> 45:17.090
Better than anybody I know.

45:18.758 --> 45:23.263
So when your phone rings
or you get a text,

45:23.346 --> 45:26.724
just let me know you're good.

45:28.268 --> 45:29.644
Okay?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.895
'Cause I need it.

45:33.523 --> 45:34.607
So do you.

45:36.651 --> 45:37.777
I will.

45:39.946 --> 45:40.989
Always.

45:42.991 --> 45:44.492
All ways.

45:46.703 --> 45:50.248
[exhales] I love you.

45:52.459 --> 45:53.668
I love you.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.753
Love you, Dad.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.271
[lock clicks]

46:57.649 --> 46:58.650
[water running]

47:06.991 --> 47:08.993
[suspenseful music playing]

47:16.668 --> 47:18.670
[indistinct chatter]

47:21.923 --> 47:23.383
Psst.

47:25.635 --> 47:28.346
[chuckles] So happy you came.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.265
Ah, I wouldn't miss it.
I wouldn't miss it.

47:30.348 --> 47:31.182
[chuckles]

47:31.266 --> 47:33.017
Just so you know,
my daughter's meeting me here.

47:33.101 --> 47:34.936
Oh, I wanna meet her.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.564
You know, pretty soon,
you're gonna be able to buy this building.

47:37.647 --> 47:38.523
You won't have to go.

47:38.606 --> 47:41.192
[exhales]
Ms. Chandler told me the same thing.

47:43.987 --> 47:45.697
I might just do that.

47:46.948 --> 47:50.994
And Harry, any piece you see in here
that you like, it is yours.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.371
I might just take you up on that.

47:53.454 --> 47:54.289
[chuckles]

47:54.372 --> 47:55.957
These are really beautiful paintings.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.460
-[exhales]
-Go on, do your thing. Do your thing.

47:59.544 --> 48:01.754
[indistinct chatter]

48:05.800 --> 48:06.676
[line out rings]

48:06.759 --> 48:08.136
[Maddie on voicemail]
I'm not here. Leave a message.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.095
[beeps]

48:09.178 --> 48:12.849
I'm here. Are you coming?
Call me back.

48:12.932 --> 48:14.934
[indistinct chatter]

48:26.237 --> 48:28.364
[sighs] Sorry, it's taken.

48:28.448 --> 48:31.117
The... [clears throat]
red dot means it's spoken for.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.035
I knew that.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.332
She said I could have any one I wanted.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.501
I should've gotten here earlier.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.213
[sighs] Is Maddie coming?
I thought she'd be here.

48:44.297 --> 48:46.257
Why, so you could drop
a subpoena on her?

48:47.425 --> 48:48.426
[sighs]

48:50.803 --> 48:55.683
Harry, please. I told you
I would not drag her into it.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.352
I told Maddie that too.

48:57.435 --> 49:00.063
At most, she would have to appear
for two minutes at trial

49:00.146 --> 49:01.773
to authenticate her bodycam footage.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.274
And that's not dragging her into it?

49:03.358 --> 49:07.445
Her camera caught a pivotal moment
in the aftermath of the shooting.

49:07.528 --> 49:09.197
I don't care what it caught.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.449
She loves the job
and you're gonna turn her into a pariah.

49:11.532 --> 49:13.034
Don't you get it?

49:22.377 --> 49:23.878
[indistinct chatter]

49:23.961 --> 49:26.839
[camera shutter clicking]

49:32.470 --> 49:34.847
[line out ringing]

49:34.931 --> 49:36.516
[Maddie on voicemail]
I'm not here. Leave a message.

49:36.599 --> 49:37.767
[beeps]

49:37.850 --> 49:40.353
Mads, call me.
Like you, I need to hear back.

49:47.902 --> 49:49.904
[suspenseful music playing]

49:49.987 --> 49:51.239
[engine shuts off]

49:57.912 --> 49:59.914
[helicopter whirring]

50:09.173 --> 50:10.007
Maddie.

50:14.554 --> 50:15.388
Maddie, you here?

50:18.015 --> 50:19.475
Fuck this.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.019
Mads?

50:23.146 --> 50:25.106
Mads, you here?

50:28.401 --> 50:29.235
Mads?

50:32.280 --> 50:33.197
Mads?

50:52.925 --> 50:54.594
[suspenseful music playing]

51:02.560 --> 51:04.562
[theme music playing]
