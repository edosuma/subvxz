01:38.223 --> 01:44.186
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.
Let me see.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.760
Hey! What are you doing
cutting holes in my wagon?

02:17.178 --> 02:21.557
Sorry, Señor Lopez.
We were just waiting for Zorro.

02:21.724 --> 02:25.060
- Go home, muchachos.
- Do you think he's going to come?

02:25.979 --> 02:28.188
Someone thinks he will.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.404
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved
coffins for your mother and father.

02:35.572 --> 02:39.867
I would hate to carve ones for you.
Now, go!

02:50.295 --> 02:56.091
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place
for you. Get back to the mission.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.648
Don Montero, for the love of God,
why are you still here?

03:52.815 --> 03:56.068
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.489
Santa Anna's men are three miles
from the town. You have to go now.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.160
The government of Spain would like
to thank you for your devoted service.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.505
This land is the property
of the Spanish government.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.882
In two hours it will be the property
of the Mexican government...

04:20.051 --> 04:21.927
...unless I hand them over to you.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.389
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna.
He will realize that the dons...

04:25.556 --> 04:28.850
...will be dutiful taxpayers
and he will respect your claims.

04:29.018 --> 04:31.645
The rest of Alta California
I have divided equally...

04:31.813 --> 04:36.525
...among the other dons. Make sure
that all of them receive their grants.

04:41.572 --> 04:45.409
Get the children out of the plaza
immediately.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.581
The children should never have to see
the things we do.

04:51.749 --> 04:56.211
I want to see! Put me down.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.054
Zorro?

05:13.104 --> 05:16.606
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.165
Who are these men that you would
risk your life to have killed?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.542
Who are they? No idea.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.045
Three peasants pulled at random
from the crowd.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.187
Where is he?

06:14.123 --> 06:15.332
Go.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.876
Come on.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.545
My thanks to you, gentlemen.

07:49.886 --> 07:55.182
Now, if you will excuse me,
I'm missing my own party.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.617
Kill him!

08:35.306 --> 08:37.765
You would murder three innocent men
to capture me?

08:37.933 --> 08:41.477
I would murder 100 innocent men
if it meant killing you.

08:45.775 --> 08:50.946
Three men, three cuts.
A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.240
To remind you not to return.

10:34.508 --> 10:40.555
Tornado, my old friend,
you are getting too old for this.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.058
Yes, me too.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.960
Is she warm enough?

11:11.128 --> 11:14.547
I always put on an
extra blanket for you, Señor.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.754
But the good prince was not afraid
of the evil king.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.632
He raced across the drawbridge,
fighting off 100 guards.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.678
And then, looking very handsome
and dashing in the late-afternoon sun...

12:01.846 --> 12:05.348
...he leapt onto the balcony
and thrust his enchanted sword...

12:05.516 --> 12:06.766
...under the king's chin.

12:07.768 --> 12:12.230
"You would kill three innocent men
just to capture me?"

12:12.398 --> 12:14.107
"Yes."

12:15.651 --> 12:20.321
Then suddenly lightning flashed
and thunder shocked the wasted land.

12:20.489 --> 12:25.326
The evil king glared
at the good prince and said...

12:27.747 --> 12:30.081
Something very forgettable.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.751
And the good prince,
what did he do?

12:33.961 --> 12:38.965
Well, he leapt from the balcony
onto his faithful old steed, Tornado...

12:39.133 --> 12:42.510
...and raced home to his
beautiful wife, Esperanza...

12:42.678 --> 12:45.263
...and to his little child, Elena.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.559
Never to do anything
so foolish or dangerous again.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.771
She loves to hear your stories.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.025
It's only the sound of my voice.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.611
One day she will have
no time for them.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.531
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.874
Esperanza.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.050
She already has your strength.

13:22.218 --> 13:26.012
Today she broke the little clay horse
you made for her.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.097
Diego.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.517
It's just a scratch.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.936
Diego, you promised me.

13:33.103 --> 13:36.981
No more nights waiting up
praying you come home alive.

13:37.149 --> 13:42.570
The Spaniards are going home.
Today is Zorro's last ride.

13:42.738 --> 13:47.492
From now on we will grow
old together with our five children.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.913
- Five?
- Yeah. Not enough?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.916
I love you.

14:06.762 --> 14:10.640
Doña de la Vega,
still as beautiful as ever.

14:11.517 --> 14:17.146
Don Rafael, what an honor.
The governor in my home.

14:17.314 --> 14:22.819
- You'll stay for dinner, of course.
- I have come to apologize, Esperanza.

14:22.987 --> 14:27.740
I'm sorry that I could not protect
this country from the peasants.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.952
I'm sorry that I couldn't
make you love me.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.455
And I'm sorry that I have
to leave you without a husband.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.624
Arrest him.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.937
Blood never lies, Zorro.

14:59.023 --> 15:04.569
You are a traitor to your country
and your class. Take him away.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.410
Wait.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.699
- No!
- No!

16:10.844 --> 16:14.847
I would never have let
any harm come to her.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.141
She was never yours to protect.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.563
Elena.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.743
I want you to live
with the knowledge...

16:35.911 --> 16:38.287
...that you have lost everything
that you hold dear.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.167
I want you to suffer
as I have suffered...

16:43.335 --> 16:45.586
...knowing that your child
should have been mine.

17:04.397 --> 17:08.276
Elena! Elena!

17:24.376 --> 17:26.335
Let me hold her.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.505
Let me hold her!

17:30.132 --> 17:32.759
Rafael!

17:32.926 --> 17:35.887
She has her mother's eyes.

17:45.189 --> 17:49.776
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!

18:25.813 --> 18:29.732
Stayed on their track
Bringing them back

18:29.900 --> 18:35.071
So pay the bounty now to me
'Cause...

18:41.036 --> 18:43.663
'Cause...?

18:43.831 --> 18:49.085
- Nobody's tough as Jack
- Nobody's tough as Jack

18:50.712 --> 18:53.798
Now you're getting there.
Like I done told you...

18:53.966 --> 18:56.968
...singing can lighten
your terrible load.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.323
Hey, hey, hey!

19:19.491 --> 19:24.704
Come one, come all,
for the fright of your life.

19:24.872 --> 19:31.085
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.
Robbers, horse thieves...

19:31.253 --> 19:37.300
...bandits, people of the worst sort.
Hey! Get out here.

19:38.969 --> 19:44.599
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.812
Get over here.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.120
These men are now in the custody
of Corporal Armando Garcia.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.289
We will take them
the rest of the way.

20:08.457 --> 20:13.169
- Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.
- When bulls start wearing bloomers.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.963
How much are we worth?

20:16.131 --> 20:21.385
All figured, about 200 pesos.

20:22.554 --> 20:27.308
Two hundred pesos? That's it?
A lousy 200 pesos apiece?

20:27.476 --> 20:31.646
- We are wasting time.
- That's 200 for the both of you.

20:31.813 --> 20:35.608
What? Are you crazy?
Don't take it, Jack.

20:38.028 --> 20:42.031
Touch my brother again,
and I'll kill you.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.408
Yes, he will.

20:45.869 --> 20:49.080
Hey, I thought you were tied up.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.333
That's because you're stupid.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.007
Drop it. Drop it.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.221
Hey.

21:07.224 --> 21:12.311
- They got a strongbox on the wagon.
- We know. That's why we came.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.445
It is a fact that I, the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack...

21:21.613 --> 21:24.699
...ain't even mentioned.
I ain't even mentioned.

21:24.866 --> 21:30.037
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap
the mayor from his own outhouse?

21:30.205 --> 21:34.375
I tell you, I am the holy guts
of this gang.

21:34.543 --> 21:38.045
Without me,
the whole dang opera falls apart.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.513
Go. Go.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.724
Come on. Get up, get up.

22:35.979 --> 22:41.150
Go.

23:01.922 --> 23:05.966
I want you to know
I consider this an honor.

23:39.334 --> 23:43.712
Bury the body. Bag the head.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.901
Of course I have feelings for you.

24:47.068 --> 24:53.115
Yes, yes, but quick.
Hide in the barn.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.075
He's coming.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.250
What do you want?
Please don't touch me.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.212
What do you want? Who are you?

25:12.719 --> 25:15.429
Don Rafael!

26:09.025 --> 26:10.985
Listen to me.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.822
If any of you is, or ever was...

26:14.990 --> 26:18.993
...that masked man all dressed
in black known as Zorro...

26:19.160 --> 26:21.954
...reveal himself now.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.457
I'm Zorro!

26:25.625 --> 26:31.005
- They took my mask, my sword...
- Silence, you old fool!

26:31.172 --> 26:36.135
I am Zorro! I am the man you want.
I am the original...

26:36.303 --> 26:41.015
Liar! Anyone can see
you are too tall.

27:26.394 --> 27:30.648
Get him out of here
before he starts to stink.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.376
Did you find him?

27:53.963 --> 27:55.714
He's dead.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.094
Back to the boat. I need some sleep
before landing tomorrow.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.869
The governor has returned!

29:58.588 --> 29:59.671
Luiz.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.092
Welcome home, Rafael.
It has been too long.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.386
Too long, my friend.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.307
You said once
you favored me above all.

30:10.475 --> 30:14.561
Consider this a fool's apology
for ever doubting you.

30:20.401 --> 30:25.239
Come. A crowd has
gathered to greet you.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.287
- Don Pedro.
- Don Rafael, welcome.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.164
- You're looking well.
- Thank you.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.916
- Don Hector.
- Welcome back, sir.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.752
Don Julio.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.380
Gentlemen.

30:48.179 --> 30:51.014
Please, please.

30:51.975 --> 30:55.060
I know you are not
really happy to see me...

30:55.228 --> 30:58.605
...so let us all stop pretending,
shall we?

30:58.773 --> 31:01.775
You think I don't know
that you have been paid...

31:01.943 --> 31:05.571
...even threatened, to come out
in the hot sun and greet me?

31:06.364 --> 31:10.200
I understand exactly how you feel.

31:10.368 --> 31:15.122
Why should you care about any
of your leaders, past or present?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.624
What did they ever do for you?

31:18.042 --> 31:21.795
The Spaniards oppressed you,
the Mexicans ignored you.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.841
And the dons?
Well, the dons, the dons.

31:26.009 --> 31:31.138
The dons seem merely content
to cheat and lie to you.

31:33.308 --> 31:38.020
In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your
entire history, has ever helped you?

31:38.187 --> 31:42.649
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.365
Yes, Zorro.

31:50.533 --> 31:54.828
Where is he now, Padre,
your masked friend?

31:54.996 --> 31:58.707
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't
shown himself in 20 years.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.501
Twenty years!

32:02.086 --> 32:04.504
People of California...

32:04.672 --> 32:08.175
...the time has come to take
our destiny into our own hands.

32:08.343 --> 32:14.014
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans,
but as Californians.

32:20.647 --> 32:25.192
I stand here before you today
with no mask.

32:25.360 --> 32:31.323
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge
that I will never abandon you.

32:31.491 --> 32:35.285
And you have my word,
the word of Rafael Montero...

32:35.453 --> 32:38.705
...that I will do everything within
my power to help you fight...

32:38.873 --> 32:41.750
...for a free and independent
California!

32:52.929 --> 32:54.763
Father.

33:00.019 --> 33:04.398
Gentlemen, allow me
to introduce my daughter, Elena.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.991
Thank you.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.578
Can anyone tell me what
this flower is? I know this scent.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.498
It's called romneya.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.417
But it only grows in California...

33:23.584 --> 33:26.420
...and I believe this is your first visit
to our shores.

33:26.587 --> 33:28.213
Yes.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.911
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.208
Or whatever you call this. I don't
want to see the bottom of this glass.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.754
Money first.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.841
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

34:15.553 --> 34:18.513
- What about this?
- Silver!

34:19.681 --> 34:22.684
Of course, silver. The finest.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.819
- Where did you get that?
- It's none of your business.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.906
Where did you get it?

34:39.118 --> 34:41.161
It was my brother's.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.121
He is dead.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.087
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

34:50.254 --> 34:52.589
Why should you be sorry?

34:54.217 --> 34:57.260
You should not trade it
for a mere glass of whiskey.

34:57.428 --> 35:01.389
Why not?
You think I could get two?

35:08.523 --> 35:10.232
Who is that?

35:14.862 --> 35:17.614
- The man who killed my brother.
- You're drunk and angry...

35:17.782 --> 35:21.076
...in no condition to fight
a professional soldier.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.746
Get out of my way, old man.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.236
Would you care to try again?

35:57.488 --> 35:59.364
You're welcome.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.911
- For what?
- For saving your life.

36:09.250 --> 36:13.837
- I would have killed him.
- No, not today. He is trained to kill.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.755
You seem trained to drink.

36:15.923 --> 36:19.009
You would have fought very bravely
and died very quickly.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.636
Who then would
avenge your brother?

36:23.264 --> 36:25.307
I would have found a way.

36:26.058 --> 36:29.436
- I have never lost a fight.
- Except to a crippled old man just now.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.649
- What is your name?
- Alejandro.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.610
Alejandro.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.364
You know,
there is a very old saying:

36:41.532 --> 36:43.867
"When the pupil is ready,
the master will appear."

36:44.035 --> 36:46.786
If you want to kill this man
I can teach you how.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.873
How to move, how to think,
how to take your revenge with honor.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.127
And live to celebrate it.
It will take dedication and time.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.130
Why are you so eager to help me?

36:57.298 --> 37:01.301
Because once, a long time ago...

37:03.471 --> 37:05.305
...you did the same for me.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.401
I can't believe it.

37:19.195 --> 37:25.116
I never thought that, one day, I would
be standing in the lair of the fox.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.035
In the lair of Zorro.

37:29.288 --> 37:33.208
This place was devoted
to the training of Zorro.

37:34.710 --> 37:39.047
Where were you all these years?
I thought you were dead.

37:39.966 --> 37:44.886
I was dead.
And we will leave it at that.

37:51.602 --> 37:57.148
I remember the last time I saw you.
You were fighting a hundred men.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.025
- A hundred men?
- I do not forget.

37:59.193 --> 38:03.238
You were the greatest swordsman
who ever lived. Yes.

38:03.406 --> 38:07.158
Rafael Montero was
the governor of California then.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.703
Do you remember him?

38:10.871 --> 38:12.205
What?

38:13.040 --> 38:16.710
Rafael Montero.
Do you remember him?

38:16.877 --> 38:20.880
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

38:21.048 --> 38:25.802
And he was the sworn enemy
of Zorro. You.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.724
- Montero has come back.
- Good. Then you can kill him.

38:30.891 --> 38:35.312
No, there are too many complications
for me to ignore.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.733
What complications?

38:45.489 --> 38:49.367
I can see we are not gonna
spend much time talking.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.747
Montero has some design
for California...

38:53.914 --> 38:57.751
...otherwise he would not have
retained the services of Captain Love.

38:57.918 --> 39:02.297
- We must find out what that is.
- And then what?

39:02.465 --> 39:07.260
If you are ready,
we will both tempt our fates.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.304
Let's go, then.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.977
Do you know how to use that thing?

39:16.145 --> 39:19.189
Yes. The pointy end
goes into the other man.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.112
This is going to take a lot of work.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.910
This is called a training circle.
The master's wheel.

39:32.078 --> 39:36.206
This circle will be your world,
your whole life.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.459
Till I tell you otherwise,
there is nothing outside of it.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.963
- Captain Love...
- There is nothing outside of it.

39:44.131 --> 39:48.301
Captain Love does not exist
until I say he exists.

39:53.224 --> 39:59.270
As your skill improves you will
progress to a smaller circle.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.982
Each new circle brings you
that much closer to your adversary.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.068
That much closer to retribution.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.990
- I like that part.
- Shall we?

40:32.096 --> 40:36.850
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.

40:37.017 --> 40:39.936
Slow. Again. Slow.

40:40.104 --> 40:44.899
First triangle. Slowly. Good.

40:45.067 --> 40:48.403
- Good. That is good.
- Thank you.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.864
Attack.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.035
Good.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.873
Time for a drink.

41:10.759 --> 41:13.428
Perfect. Do it again.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.656
One, five, three!

41:34.408 --> 41:36.784
Six, four, two!

41:36.952 --> 41:39.370
And lunge.

41:39.538 --> 41:41.331
Over-lunge!

41:50.090 --> 41:54.886
Lesson number one:
Never attack in anger.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.310
Lesson number two:

42:02.478 --> 42:04.604
Come with me.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.316
What?

42:22.164 --> 42:27.877
- So, what is lesson number three?
- To get to lesson number four.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.149
Again?

43:12.214 --> 43:17.635
- Black Andalusian. Magnificent.
- It looks like your old horse, Tornado.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.718
Quiet, quiet.

44:09.980 --> 44:15.401
Damned horse. What are you
doing, huh? What are you doing?

44:17.404 --> 44:18.863
I'll see you tonight.

44:41.136 --> 44:44.555
Zorro, you look better than ever.

45:10.958 --> 45:15.795
Be careful, señorita,
there are dangerous men about.

45:15.963 --> 45:20.842
Well, if you see any,
be sure to point them out.

46:36.210 --> 46:40.797
Listen. I'm going to give you
the great honor...

46:40.964 --> 46:43.591
...of being my horse.

47:00.567 --> 47:04.237
We are like one spirit.

47:09.451 --> 47:12.245
Damn it! Stop!

48:08.719 --> 48:11.304
Go, go, go!

48:42.544 --> 48:45.212
Get him!

50:43.790 --> 50:45.750
Kill him.

51:21.661 --> 51:26.332
Zorro! The legend has returned!

52:05.372 --> 52:07.081
Don't yell.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.378
I need sanctuary, Father.
You don't know me...

52:12.546 --> 52:15.005
Zorro! Of course I know you.

52:15.173 --> 52:20.136
Zorro, is it really you? The years
have been kinder to you than to me.

52:20.303 --> 52:26.142
I have no time to talk now.
Father, please, hide me.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.560
Come.

52:32.190 --> 52:34.733
It's just like the old days.

52:42.617 --> 52:45.077
Padre, is that you?

52:45.912 --> 52:49.415
Is everything all right? It sounds
like there is a battle going on.

52:50.750 --> 52:55.880
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe
in the house of the Lord.

52:56.047 --> 53:00.426
Of course, Padre.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.678
It has been three days
since my last confession.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.764
How many sins could you
have committed in three days?

53:05.932 --> 53:08.934
Come back when you have
more time, please.

53:09.102 --> 53:14.190
- Excuse me?
- Listen, señorita...

53:16.943 --> 53:20.362
Please, go on.

53:21.448 --> 53:25.826
- I broke the Fourth Commandment.
- You killed somebody?

53:25.994 --> 53:31.457
- That's not the Fourth Commandment.
- Of course not.

53:32.584 --> 53:38.214
In what way did you break
the most sacred of Commandments?

53:38.381 --> 53:41.300
I dishonored my father.

53:41.843 --> 53:45.304
That is not so bad.
Maybe your father deserved it.

53:45.472 --> 53:51.894
- What did you say?
- I said, tell me more, my child.

53:52.646 --> 53:57.274
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

53:57.442 --> 54:01.528
- But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.
- Too wild?

54:01.696 --> 54:06.492
- Yes.
- Could you be more specific?

54:06.660 --> 54:09.203
I had impure thoughts about a man.

54:09.371 --> 54:13.832
I did. I think he was a bandit
or something. He wore a black mask.

54:16.461 --> 54:21.799
- He had a deep voice?
- Yes.

54:22.676 --> 54:28.806
- Ruggedly handsome?
- His face was half-covered.

54:28.974 --> 54:32.059
But something in his eyes
captured me.

54:32.435 --> 54:33.686
Captured you.

54:33.853 --> 54:38.857
I felt warm and feverish.

54:39.025 --> 54:40.734
Lustful?

54:43.655 --> 54:46.240
Yes, lustful.

54:49.077 --> 54:50.494
Forgive me.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.209
I forgive you.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.966
Look over there, by the altar.

55:06.344 --> 55:11.849
Search everything. The chapel,
the loft, the rectory, all of it.

55:12.017 --> 55:14.560
This is a house of God.

55:14.936 --> 55:18.355
Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone
by the time he gets back.

55:20.942 --> 55:24.653
Señorita,
you have done nothing wrong.

55:24.821 --> 55:29.450
The only sin would be to deny
what your heart truly feels.

55:30.452 --> 55:32.369
Now, go.

55:35.498 --> 55:37.333
Elena.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.382
- What are you doing here?
- I was confessing.

55:45.550 --> 55:47.760
- Confessing?
- Yes.

55:48.428 --> 55:51.096
To whom? The priest is here.

55:54.267 --> 55:58.270
Stand back, Elena. Please.

56:16.748 --> 56:22.127
Out of respect for Miss Montero,
I'll deal with you later.

56:30.136 --> 56:32.805
Horse! Come here.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.940
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!

56:43.108 --> 56:46.693
Stupido! Get over here now!

56:48.071 --> 56:53.534
I warn you. I'll get another horse.

58:01.227 --> 58:03.520
So?

58:03.688 --> 58:05.564
What do you think?

58:09.569 --> 58:16.033
Sir, I got the black stallion,
I carved a "Z" in the...

58:17.744 --> 58:20.621
The people will be speaking
the name of Zorro again.

58:20.788 --> 58:27.294
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?

58:29.214 --> 58:31.256
Be careful.

58:34.302 --> 58:39.014
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.

58:39.182 --> 58:42.935
Zorro was a servant of the people,
not a seeker of fame like you.

58:44.562 --> 58:45.771
A buffoon.

58:48.650 --> 58:52.069
- Zorro did what was needed.
- Now he is needed again.

58:54.614 --> 58:57.115
I didn't ask for your help
in the cantina...

58:57.283 --> 59:01.662
...but I came here
to learn how to fight like you.

59:01.829 --> 59:05.332
To have your strength,
your courage.

59:05.500 --> 59:09.628
Now when I try to use them,
you slap me down?

59:09.796 --> 59:15.384
Let me tell you something. I am tired
of all your training, your lecturing.

59:15.552 --> 59:20.264
I am tired of waiting for you
to tell me I am ready.

59:20.431 --> 59:25.978
I have my own scores to settle,
a new life to find.

59:27.230 --> 59:31.984
I thought I could do it here,
but I was wrong.

59:32.819 --> 59:35.487
Alejandro!

59:35.655 --> 59:37.656
En garde!

59:41.578 --> 59:43.829
Choose your weapon.

01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:08.186
Montero has invited every don
in California to a banquet.

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:13.025
If you want to be of service,
you can join them as a spy.

01:00:14.068 --> 01:00:17.571
I think I do not understand, sir.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:21.325
You have passion, Alejandro,
and your skill is growing.

01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:25.746
But I must give you something
which is beyond your reach.

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:31.168
- Yes? What is that?
- Charm.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.879
And what is that?

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:41.219
Convince Montero that you are
a gentleman of stature...

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:44.139
...and he will let you into his circle.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.311
Me?

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:52.481
A gentleman?

01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.693
This is gonna take a lot of work.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.530
Yes.

01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:21.927
Look at me. I look like a butterfly.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.304
This is the most stupid thing
I've ever done.

01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:27.099
- I doubt that.
- We'll never get away with this.

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:29.059
Yes, we will.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:34.439
A nobleman is a man who says
one thing and thinks another.

01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:36.608
What if Montero realizes who you are?

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.778
Montero thinks of himself
as a true nobleman.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:44.449
He will never look a servant
in the eye. Listen to me.

01:01:44.617 --> 01:01:46.785
Listen to me!

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.289
Most important thing of all...

01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:54.292
...do not let the dons
leave the table without you.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.128
Yes, sir.

01:01:57.463 --> 01:02:01.633
- Good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:06.263
Stand up straight. Charm.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.140
Charm.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:29.536
Don Rafael Montero?
Good evening.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.622
I am Don Alejandro
del Castillo y Garcia.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:37.669
The formal Spanish greeting.
I have not seen that in years.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:42.507
- My father was very strict.
- Who is your father?

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:44.551
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:48.847
I have heard of him, but never had
the pleasure of meeting him.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:55.020
I arrived last week from Spain by way
of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:58.273
I am inspecting
my family's holdings.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:08.200
Queen Isabella of Spain
has been very generous to us.

01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:12.704
Very impressive.
What brings you here?

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:17.417
I heard you were back in California
and knew I must introduce myself.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.045
Her Royal Highness
speaks very highly of you.

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:24.549
Really?

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:29.846
I thought I fell out of favor with
the court when California was lost.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:38.980
Only in certain circles.

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:43.693
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were clearly no fault of yours.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:49.908
She told me this is still a land
of opportunity for a man of vision.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:56.289
- And you are a man of vision?
- I am a man in search of a vision.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:03.296
But my timing is unfortunate.
I have interrupted a party.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:05.423
Perhaps I could call again?

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.845
No, it would honor me
for you to join us.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:13.849
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:17.727
Please allow me to introduce
my daughter, Elena.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.775
Charmed.

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.782
I'm afraid I have brought no gift
for the hostess...

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:34.244
...but wait a moment.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:49.134
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:58.768
Bernardo, pick up your feet.
Señorita. Caballero.

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.588
Don Alejandro.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.633
My father and I would like you
to join us at our table.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.678
I would be delighted, señorita.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:49.194
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased
you could join us.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:52.989
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:55.659
Recently returned from Spain.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:06:02.290
This is Captain Harrison Love.
Not a don, but a kindred spirit.

01:06:03.834 --> 01:06:08.588
Are you not the man who was
chasing a legendary bandit recently?

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:12.258
- He was hardly legendary.
- So you caught him?

01:06:12.426 --> 01:06:18.223
- It's only a matter of time.
- The bandit may have escaped...

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:23.561
...but the rest of us will think twice
before going to confession.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.920
Thank you.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.759
With all due respect, Don Hector,
I disagree.

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:57.929
Until these people are free
to govern themselves...

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.683
...I think we will see
many more Z's carved into walls.

01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:07.397
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:12.360
I think sheep will
always need a shepherd.

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:17.782
But certainly not this Zorro creature.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:23.747
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:31.463
- Some would call him heroic.
- Heroism, a romantic illusion.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:34.966
- Much like nobility.
- Elena, that is enough.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:38.887
I would think heroism is something
to aspire to, not sneer at.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:43.808
All that playing swords, shooting guns,
racing around on horses...

01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:45.643
...gives me a frightful headache.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.731
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly
the work of a gentleman.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.901
And what is?
Climbing in and out of carriages?

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:54.861
No, my dear.

01:07:55.029 --> 01:08:00.658
But increasing one's holdings so as
to provide lavish comfort for ladies.

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:03.161
Such as yourself.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.253
A woman's grasp of politics.
What can I say?

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:21.888
We're at a party, aren't we?
May I have the honor of this dance?

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:26.600
I would be glad to.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.652
Yes? Were you looking
for something?

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:21.363
A sense of the miraculous
in everyday life.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:27.787
Oh, really? Look someplace else.
The lady and I were trying to dance.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:33.167
You were trying.
She was succeeding.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:37.796
Forgive me, captain.
A shameless joke at your expense.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:43.928
I hope it will not be the last.
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:34.979
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?

01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:37.649
No, on the contrary.

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:42.487
I think only of your distaste
for perspiration.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.113
Maestro.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:14.329
Well, that is the way they are dancing
in Madrid these days.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.498
Excuse me, Don Rafael,
I need to catch my breath.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:20.752
Your daughter is
a very spirited dancer.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:25.757
"Spirited." Thank you
for putting it so delicately.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:32.138
I apologize if you're offended.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:35.850
No, no, no.
Completely unnecessary, I assure you.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:40.313
She is young and impulsive,
but her beauty is beyond compare.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:43.941
And she has her father's
commanding presence.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.945
Don Rafael.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.995
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness
in matters of finance...

01:12:56.163 --> 01:13:00.416
...it would be my pleasure
to introduce you both at court.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:14.305
Join us in the courtyard. There is
something I want to share with you.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.099
What is that?

01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:18.643
A vision.

01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:30.822
Fellow dons of California...

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:35.827
...all of us can recall the golden years
when we ruled this country.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:40.748
We commanded respect
and amassed a great deal of wealth.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.167
But there was something
that we never achieved.

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:46.838
We never determined
our own destiny.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:54.512
Well, the time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.557
My friends...

01:13:57.724 --> 01:14:04.063
...I give you the independent
Republic of California.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:22.415
Don Rafael, every man here
owes you something.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.376
The land you gave us
made us all wealthy men.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:30.131
However, we must question
your motives.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:33.468
The day you arrived,
you made us look like fools.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.013
That is absurd, Don Pedro.
I was merely playing to the crowd.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:40.641
And what are you doing now
if not playing to the crowd?

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:44.937
You're inciting us to raise arms
against Santa Anna.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:48.191
You know perfectly well
we could never defeat his army.

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:52.028
I was not suggesting that
we fight him for California.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:55.072
I was suggesting that
we buy it from him.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:58.784
Santa Anna is waging an expensive
war with the United States...

01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:00.786
...and is increasingly
short of money.

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:03.998
Even if we all combined
our fortunes...

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.668
...we could not come up with enough
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.671
I have already
brokered a deal with him.

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:14.258
You are living in a dream.

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:20.306
And why don't we all live
in the same dream together?

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:37.782
Meet me here tomorrow morning
for a journey...

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.619
...that will open your eyes
and lay all your doubts to rest.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:39.760
My friends, I give you El Dorado!

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:53.524
Technically, of course,
all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:57.820
...but, fortunately for us, he's
completely unaware of its existence.

01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.823
For the deception to work,
these bars have been marked...

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:03.951
...with the Spanish seal
so he'll think they're from Spain.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.539
You see now, gentlemen?
Is it becoming clearer to you?

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:13.461
Two days from now we will buy
this country from Santa Anna.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.672
We will buy it with gold
dug from his own land.

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:32.980
- Where did you find all these people?
- Anywhere we wanted.

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:38.402
Brilliant.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.241
It's only part of the mining process.

01:17:44.409 --> 01:17:47.745
First we picked it up off the ground,
now we're down to blasting.

01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:07.098
So this is the future of California?

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:11.769
This is my vision, yes.

01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:19.694
Up here. Well, now,
ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:25.116
Full-grown vultures
walking around like real folk.

01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:29.036
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:35.710
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:41.298
- We're just hard to find.
- Wait! You. I know you.

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.217
You bet you do, peckerwood.

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:46.011
I'm the legendary
Three-Fingered Jack.

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:49.682
And you are a bunch
of murdering trash...

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:54.228
...dressed up in fancy,
sweet-smelling doodads.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:57.356
Ignore him, gentlemen.
He's a common thief.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.984
As common as they come.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:04.155
But I ain't nothing
compared to you gentlemen.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:07.158
I steal gold, I steal money.

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.995
But you steal people's lives.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:15.249
So damn you!
And damn the horse that brung you.

01:19:35.353 --> 01:19:37.354
Peckerwood?

01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:23.359
Is there something
amusing, captain?

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:26.070
Strange, I'd say.

01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:30.574
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:43.838
Don Alejandro! I need to speak
with you at the hacienda, alone.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.344
- Some other time, perhaps.
- Today. Alone.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.995
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:19.540
Good afternoon, señorita.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.251
Your voice is so calming.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:24.962
He's high-spirited.
He needs to hear something soothing.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.506
Yes, I understand.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:32.761
How long have you served
Don Alejandro?

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:36.891
Sometimes it seems interminable.
Sorry, I speak out of place.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:41.145
Do not worry, Bernardo.
He will not hear it from me.

01:21:42.522 --> 01:21:46.191
Don Alejandro confuses me.

01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:52.072
Sometimes he seems
so arrogant, so superior.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:57.786
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me...

01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:00.664
As if he were
two completely different men.

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:02.249
Yeah.

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:13.469
You look so much like your mother.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:17.348
How would you know that?

01:22:17.515 --> 01:22:22.895
Well, I don't see
much of Don Rafael in you.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:28.859
I know my father wishes
I acted more like her.

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:32.738
She was very proper, my mother.
Always appropriate

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.531
Is that how he describes her?

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:39.745
- Yes. But I do not believe him.
- She was more like you.

01:22:41.998 --> 01:22:47.878
Perhaps.
It would be a way of knowing her.

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:55.844
My niñera told me that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

01:22:56.012 --> 01:23:02.059
When I was young I sneaked out
at night and rode across Andalusia.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:05.854
I would wave at the skies
so she would know it was me.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:15.531
- How did she die?
- Giving birth to me.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:21.787
My father rarely speaks of her.
I think he finds it too painful.

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.748
Yes.

01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:34.091
I know what it is like
to lose a loved one.

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:36.510
You?

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:41.348
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.

01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:48.814
When I see you, I remember
what it felt like to be a father.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:58.282
- Your mother would be proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:04.913
Bernardo, I have to ask you,
have we ever met before?

01:24:05.623 --> 01:24:08.584
No, why would you think that?

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:15.049
I do not know. It's strange,
your voice seems so familiar.

01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:20.596
I haven't been to Spain
since before you were born.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:22.723
Of course.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.352
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:31.356
Thank you.

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:34.693
- Good day, Bernardo.
- Good day...

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:42.117
...Elena.

01:24:57.383 --> 01:25:00.844
Did you know that
the Compa Indians of central Peru...

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:05.724
...used to cannibalize their enemies
in order to absorb their power?

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.686
The eyes in particular
were most sought after.

01:25:12.315 --> 01:25:18.487
To be able to see through the eyes
of an enemy is a valuable thing.

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:27.371
Where are my manners? Would you
care for something to drink?

01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:35.671
No?

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:39.883
A different vintage perhaps?

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.478
You're a very sick person,
Captain Love.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:56.150
Heads in water jars,
hands in wine pitchers...

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:59.319
...must strike you as odd, I suppose.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:04.283
Well, for one thing, I think
you ought to fire your housekeeper.

01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:14.626
- Who is he?
- An enemy.

01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:19.256
He has a brother out there
who will share the same fate.

01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:24.887
I wish you luck.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:33.312
- To your health.
- Murrieta's brother or not...

01:26:33.479 --> 01:26:36.773
...you are more than
you pretend to be.

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:41.570
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes...

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.614
...Captain Love.

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:32.663
Oh, it is beautiful.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:51.515
Excuse me. How much does it cost?

01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:00.691
It is a gift, she says,
in honor of your mother.

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:04.194
My mother?

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:09.658
- She loved your mother.
- She must be mistaken.

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:13.203
My mother died long ago in Spain.

01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.049
She says there is no mistaking...

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:29.511
...the daughter of Esperanza
and Diego de la Vega.

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:36.101
She says she was your nanny.
She hung flowers on your crib.

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:41.064
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:03.253
Alejandro.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:08.842
Listen to me. Can you find
your way back to the mine?

01:29:10.261 --> 01:29:12.095
No.

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:17.351
The carriage windows
were all covered.

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:21.438
- He didn't even trust his own dons.
- Nor would I.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.732
You must go to
Montero's house tonight.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.026
Break into the chest in his study.

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:30.655
- Find out what his plans are.
- People in the mine are dying.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:36.620
And all I can think of
is Captain Love.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:39.456
He will come into your circle
soon enough.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:46.588
- I miss my brother, sir.
- Your brother is dead.

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:49.383
We lose the ones we love.
Put it aside.

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:52.803
How?

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.640
How can I do what is needed...

01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:01.436
...when all I feel is hate?

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:04.648
You hide it.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:08.652
With this.

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:22.958
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer
at noon the day after tomorrow.

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:26.420
He insists we deliver the gold
five miles north of town.

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.380
Captain Love?

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:34.970
It's a safe distance from the mine.
The bars are stamped and ready.

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.013
I don't foresee a problem.

01:30:37.181 --> 01:30:42.561
Tell him we agree.
You have done well, Luiz. Very well.

01:30:46.065 --> 01:30:49.526
To the independent
Republic of California.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.824
Don Rafael!

01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:22.809
You sent men to the hills?
Doubled the guard at the wall?

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.853
Yes, yes, of course.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.323
- After all, it's only one man.
- It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.

01:31:37.533 --> 01:31:42.370
And he knows about the mine.
Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.

01:31:42.538 --> 01:31:45.790
- How could he possibly...?
- It doesn't matter how.

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:48.084
You don't seem to grasp
the situation.

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:52.839
If Santa Anna finds out about this
he will have us butchered.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:55.884
Do you understand?

01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:00.764
Then we should
destroy the evidence.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:02.807
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:08.772
- And the workers?
- We destroy all the evidence.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.899
No witnesses.

01:32:17.823 --> 01:32:20.534
Make sure
those papers are locked up.

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:39.886
Guards!

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:54.317
- The much-debated Zorro.
- No. The legendary Zorro.

01:32:57.154 --> 01:33:01.074
Put down your weapons!
Tell them.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.535
Do as he says.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.084
Allow me.

01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:20.260
Come. Stop.

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.847
Face the window.

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:29.144
Now, bend down
and touch your toes.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:33.231
Bend over!

01:33:34.984 --> 01:33:40.071
Excuse me, Captain Love.
Thank you.

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.175
Kill him!

01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:35.538
Good morning, señor.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:42.378
- Good morning, señorita.
- Give it back.

01:36:43.255 --> 01:36:45.507
- What?
- Whatever it is you have stolen...

01:36:45.674 --> 01:36:49.677
...from my father, I want it back.
Give it to me.

01:36:49.845 --> 01:36:52.096
No.

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:00.396
Come on, now.

01:37:14.286 --> 01:37:17.330
I don't have the time
to give you the proper instruction.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:23.753
I have had the proper instruction
since I was 4.

01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:19.267
Not bad.

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:23.146
Not bad at all.

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:50.173
This will make it more difficult.
Señorita...

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:16.866
Don't move.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:41.849
- Do you surrender?
- Never.

01:39:42.559 --> 01:39:45.019
But I may scream.

01:39:45.896 --> 01:39:48.064
I understand.

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:50.900
Sometimes I have that effect.

01:40:19.596 --> 01:40:22.515
Excuse me.

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:27.103
Goodbye, señorita.

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:40.074
What are you doing?
What happened?

01:40:40.409 --> 01:40:45.788
Zorro. Zorro was here.
I fought him and he left. He left.

01:40:45.956 --> 01:40:52.378
- Did you recognize him?
- No, but he was young and vigorous.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:56.674
- He was very vigorous, Father.
- Vigorous?

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:59.302
Yes.

01:41:38.467 --> 01:41:39.967
Let's go!

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:58.421
Go!

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:37.877
Come on!

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:17.375
Here. This is the canyon.
That is where the mine is.

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:22.797
They have 25, 30 guards at most.

01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:26.175
- Nothing that Zorro can't overcome.
- I'm not going with you.

01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:28.177
What?

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.597
I'm not going with you.

01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:36.852
There's something I must do.
It's a personal matter.

01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:41.857
- What about the prisoners?
- There's nothing more I can do.

01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:46.821
- You mean, nothing you will do.
- I gave my life to them.

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:51.117
In return, I lose everything. My wife
was murdered before my eyes...

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:54.996
...and my child was stolen
to be raised by my mortal enemy.

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:58.708
Montero?

01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:02.920
Elena.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:06.966
She's your daughter.

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:10.344
Yeah, she was.

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:16.058
So...

01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:18.978
...you will simply take your revenge.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:23.733
No, I will take my daughter. And don't
pretend she means nothing to you.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:28.904
She does. But you taught me
to see beyond personal feelings.

01:45:29.072 --> 01:45:33.826
- Was that all a lie?
- You're too young to understand.

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:38.080
To understand what? Betrayal?

01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:42.251
All the work, all the training,
all the wise words, for what?

01:45:42.419 --> 01:45:47.757
To smile in the face of my brother's
killer while you make your own plans?

01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:54.180
Alejandro, I taught you everything
you need to survive.

01:45:54.348 --> 01:45:57.099
Now I must look to my own heart.

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:03.439
Elena is all I have left.
I am not going to lose her again.

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:10.404
What about California?
What about the people?

01:46:10.572 --> 01:46:13.115
They still have Zorro.

01:46:41.645 --> 01:46:46.190
I have every inch of the countryside
covered. If he shows himself...

01:46:47.984 --> 01:46:50.444
- Are you all right?
- Do you have the map?

01:46:50.612 --> 01:46:54.240
- We'll find it.
- Is your army ready to fight?

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:57.743
- No, sir.
- Then of course I'm not all right.

01:46:57.911 --> 01:47:01.330
I'm beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all.

01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:03.999
- What are you saying?
- What I'm saying, captain...

01:47:04.167 --> 01:47:08.712
...is that I think my horse could
run this army better than you.

01:47:12.717 --> 01:47:15.136
I said I'll find him.

01:47:17.055 --> 01:47:18.514
That means I will.

01:47:21.893 --> 01:47:25.938
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.
Go on, reach for it, captain.

01:47:28.692 --> 01:47:32.695
- Who are you?
- I warned you long ago, Rafael.

01:47:34.448 --> 01:47:37.867
- You would never be rid of me.
- De la Vega.

01:47:42.205 --> 01:47:43.539
Rafael.

01:47:43.832 --> 01:47:46.834
You were not the Zorro
I saw last night.

01:47:47.002 --> 01:47:51.172
- That was your master, Don Alejandro.
- Yes.

01:47:51.339 --> 01:47:54.383
But there are many who would
proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:59.221
Either way, events have been set
in motion that you cannot stop.

01:48:00.223 --> 01:48:02.558
I'm not here to stop you.

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.561
Call for Elena.

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:12.067
Call her.

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:17.656
Captain, bring my daughter to me.

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:22.036
Bring her to me!

01:48:30.545 --> 01:48:35.382
You cannot imagine, Rafael,
how I have dreamed of this moment.

01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:39.595
Night and day, 20 long years.

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:44.225
Really? I haven't given you
a second thought.

01:48:45.435 --> 01:48:51.732
- If I die, the truth dies with me.
- We shall see.

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.151
Father!

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:58.197
- Bernardo, what are you doing?
- Tell her, Rafael.

01:48:59.908 --> 01:49:04.370
- Tell me what? What is going on?
- Tell her who her real father is.

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:08.082
Father, what is he saying?

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:14.922
This unfortunate man
lost a daughter once...

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:18.259
...and now he seeks to claim you
for his own.

01:49:21.054 --> 01:49:24.265
Tell her how her mother died.

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:33.482
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega.
You cannot have mine.

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:36.235
De la Vega?

01:49:37.612 --> 01:49:40.781
A woman in town, she told me...

01:49:42.033 --> 01:49:44.326
Diego de la Vega?

01:49:47.497 --> 01:49:50.207
Father?

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:53.002
His name is of no consequence.

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:59.758
I was told my niñera used
to hang something on my crib.

01:50:01.469 --> 01:50:05.306
Yes, she had her hang
fresh flowers.

01:50:05.473 --> 01:50:09.893
No!

01:50:15.025 --> 01:50:19.194
Let us finish it, Rafael.
Let us finish what we started...

01:50:19.529 --> 01:50:22.072
...the night Esperanza died.

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:27.036
Drop your sword or I will have
no choice but to have you shot.

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:30.623
Even in the presence
of my daughter.

01:50:33.543 --> 01:50:35.878
Please.

01:50:50.518 --> 01:50:54.563
They were flowers. Romneya.

01:51:00.612 --> 01:51:03.155
Rafael...

01:51:04.699 --> 01:51:06.742
...she knows.

01:53:15.079 --> 01:53:17.706
Water!

01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:54.493
Lock them up!

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:52.551
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.056
Let's go!

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.997
Wait here!

01:55:31.674 --> 01:55:35.052
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:07.102
- De la Vega.
- Rafael.

01:58:21.344 --> 01:58:24.012
Only one question.

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:29.351
Really? What is that?

01:58:33.856 --> 01:58:36.858
How would you like
your remains displayed?

02:00:06.616 --> 02:00:11.494
- Now I'm free to kill you.
- No!

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:21.129
Drop the sword. Drop it.

02:00:30.306 --> 02:00:33.016
You really think
I would have killed my own child?

02:00:58.501 --> 02:01:00.627
Did you miss me?

02:01:23.526 --> 02:01:26.361
Elena! Get them out!

02:01:33.077 --> 02:01:39.582
- "M" for Murrieta.
- Two men. One dead.

02:02:41.771 --> 02:02:46.358
You're doing well. Your brother
would have shot himself by now.

02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:43.641
Alejandro.

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.636
Is it finished?

02:06:02.137 --> 02:06:06.641
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.

02:06:08.143 --> 02:06:10.562
Not for Zorro.

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:14.566
There will be other days,
other battles to fight.

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:18.486
It is your curse and destiny.

02:06:20.364 --> 02:06:22.574
My beautiful Elena.

02:06:25.369 --> 02:06:28.246
The world is a strange place.

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:33.001
Too have found you at last
only to lose you again.

02:06:33.294 --> 02:06:36.045
You will never lose me...

02:06:36.797 --> 02:06:39.048
...Father.

02:06:42.177 --> 02:06:43.886
Elena.

02:06:46.348 --> 02:06:48.683
You are like your mother.

02:06:50.019 --> 02:06:52.353
Same eyes.

02:06:52.521 --> 02:06:54.897
Same mouth.

02:06:55.065 --> 02:06:57.442
Same spirit.

02:07:01.989 --> 02:07:04.574
Alejandro...

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:08.494
...Elena.

02:07:28.432 --> 02:07:33.311
And so it was.
Lightning split the sky.

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:35.813
Thunder shook the air.

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:39.400
And then all was quiet.

02:07:40.527 --> 02:07:46.366
The great warrior
known as Zorro was gone.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.744
The people of the land
gave him a hero's funeral.

02:07:49.912 --> 02:07:52.413
The largest anyone had ever seen.

02:07:53.248 --> 02:07:56.334
They came from far and wide
to say farewell...

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:58.920
...to the brave and noble champion.

02:08:02.383 --> 02:08:04.967
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

02:08:05.469 --> 02:08:08.304
Whenever great deeds
are remembered...

02:08:08.472 --> 02:08:11.391
...your grandfather will live on.

02:08:12.267 --> 02:08:16.020
For there must always be a Zorro.

02:08:16.188 --> 02:08:21.526
And someday, when he is needed,
we will see him again.

02:08:21.694 --> 02:08:26.656
On his fearsome steed, Tornado,
riding like the wind.

02:08:26.824 --> 02:08:28.950
His sword blazing in the sun.

02:08:30.077 --> 02:08:33.371
Leaping, jumping!
Swinging through the air!

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:35.915
Fighting like a lion,
fighting like a tiger!

02:08:36.083 --> 02:08:38.126
Fighting...

02:08:44.967 --> 02:08:46.759
...as safely as possible.

02:08:48.679 --> 02:08:51.347
Is this your idea
of putting the baby to sleep?

02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:01.315
Sleep tight, my son.

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:13.494
When I sleep, I will dream
of this dashing rogue, Zorro.

02:09:14.037 --> 02:09:16.998
But what face shall I give him?

02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:21.043
He has been many different men...

02:09:21.211 --> 02:09:24.714
...but he has loved you
as all of them.

02:09:28.844 --> 02:09:31.846
How can I refuse such a man?

02:09:32.890 --> 02:09:35.975
Do you know where
I might find him?

02:09:36.143 --> 02:09:41.022
You know Zorro.
He could be anywhere.
