- LOOK, DENBY'S
ON THE TRAIL.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.505
SHE'LL KNOW
WE'VE GOT FROBISHER.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.342
[feedback]

11:58.426 --> 11:59.844
- ATTENTION, EVERYONE, PLEASE.

11:59.927 --> 12:06.308
I'M VERY SORRY TO SAY WE HAVE
HAD A MAJOR THEFT IN THE SCHOOL.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.644
I APOLOGIZE FOR
ANY INCONVENIENCE,

12:08.727 --> 12:10.479
AND MAY I REQUEST
THAT NO ONE LEAVES

12:10.563 --> 12:14.400
UNTIL WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
EVERYONE'S WHEREABOUTS.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.109
- CAN WE EVEN TRY DOING
THE CEREMONY NOW?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.861
- NO.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.028
NO, IT WON'T WORK.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.655
IF WE GET ONE PART WRONG,
WE FAIL.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.073
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF CEREMONY.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.324
- TONIGHT IS TOO LATE.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.535
THE ADULTS ARE GOING TO REALIZE
WE'RE MISSING

12:24.618 --> 12:25.786
AND THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.663
- I SAY WE LEAVE HIM HERE,
WE GO BACK,

12:27.746 --> 12:28.664
AND WE ACT NORMAL.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.582
- NO WAY.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.208
SOME OF US NEED TO STAY BEHIND

12:31.292 --> 12:32.918
AND WATCH OVER HIM
UNTIL IT'S TIME.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.837
AND THE OTHERS
CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND COVER.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.005
both: SCHOOL.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.216
- MY HEROES.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.635
- ALL RIGHT, ALFIE AND PATRICIA,
YOU NEED TO MAKE THE ADULTS

12:41.719 --> 12:43.220
THINK THAT WE'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE,
ANYWHERE ELSE.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.889
NOT HERE.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.476
- BUT THAT MEANS
YOU'LL BE LOCKED IN.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.935
- IN A CRYPT.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.479
- FOR HOURS.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.230
- WITH A SPOOKY SLEEPY GUY.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.524
- HAVE NONE OF YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

13:06.911 --> 13:09.705
- LOOKS LIKE WE GOT BACK
JUST IN TIME.

13:09.788 --> 13:13.375
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE BEEN?

13:20.090 --> 13:21.634
- DO YOU THINK
HE CAN HEAR US?

13:21.717 --> 13:23.385
AND IF HE CAN HEAR US,

13:23.469 --> 13:25.721
DO YOU THINK HE'S ANNOYED
THAT WE KIDNAPPED HIM?

13:25.804 --> 13:28.390
- NO, HE CAN'T HEAR US, CAN HE?

13:28.474 --> 13:32.269
- NO, NO.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.985
- ANYONE ELSE FREAKED OUT
THAT WE'RE LOCKED IN A CRYPT?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.153
- NO.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.072
- NO.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.116
- OKAY, JUST ASKING.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.745
- YOUR MAGIC ACT.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.580
- SURE, I WAS TAKING IT
OUT THE BACK DOOR.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.457
DIDN'T TRUDY TELL YOU?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.542
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.961
- SHE'S MY ASSISTANT.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.420
- ASSISTANT?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.005
WHY DO I HAVE TO
BE THE ASSISTANT?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.298
WHY COULDN'T I DO THE MAGIC
AND YOU CAN ASSIST ME?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.926
- IT'S NOT REALLY THE TIME
FOR THAT ARGUMENT.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.637
- VERY WELL, IF YOU ARE
SUCH A GREAT MAGICIAN,

14:06.720 --> 14:08.764
DO SOME MAGIC
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.266
- HUH?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.769
- COME ALONG, YOU'VE DONE
MAGIC BEFORE, HAVE YOU NOT?

14:13.852 --> 14:16.188
- UH, I NEED, LIKE,
A HANDKERCHIEF, OR--

14:16.272 --> 14:18.357
- DO MAGIC.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.734
- PLEASE, I NEED
TO WIPE MY FACE.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.070
THE PRESSURE'S
GETTING TO ME.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.321
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.990
- PLAYING FOR TIME
WON'T HELP YOU, BOY.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.617
IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT
YOU ARE LYING ABOUT THIS

14:28.701 --> 14:29.994
SO-CALLED MAGIC ACT.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.955
IN WHICH CASE, I WILL HAVE
A FULL EXPLANATION

14:33.038 --> 14:34.707
OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.501
- ABRACADABRA.
[laughs]

14:37.585 --> 14:38.836
- [chuckles]

14:43.048 --> 14:44.425
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE SCARED, KT.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.970
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.895
WHAT TIME IS IT?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.565
- SEVEN MINUTES LATER THAN
LAST TIME YOU ASKED ME.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.154
- ALFIE AND PATRICIA?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.739
- ACCOUNTED FOR.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.449
- THEN I'M SATISFIED

15:08.532 --> 15:10.868
THAT EVERYONE HERE
IS WHERE THEY SAID THEY WERE.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.495
WE ARE ONLY MISSING, UM--

15:13.579 --> 15:17.458
- YOUR SON
AND HIS TWO USUAL CRONIES.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.420
- ONE OF YOU SAY SOMETHING?

15:21.503 --> 15:22.421
- NOPE.

15:22.504 --> 15:28.427
- NO.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.763
- OKAY, ONE OF YOU DEFINITELY
WHISPERED MY NAME.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.722
- NO.

15:31.805 --> 15:32.765
- NO. NO WAY.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.183
- OKAY, WELL, IT HAD
TO BE ONE OF YOU

15:34.266 --> 15:37.936
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO ONE ELSE...HERE.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.566
- HE CAN'T.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.653
CAN HE?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.488
- HE'S SAYING SOMETHING.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.534
- BUT HE CAN'T TALK.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.827
HE'S, HE'S--

15:53.911 --> 15:55.371
- SHH.

15:55.454 --> 16:00.542
HE'S SAYING--HE'S SAYING,
YOU GUYS SCARE SO EASY.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.336
- AWW.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.213
- YOUR FACES!
[laughs]

16:04.296 --> 16:05.714
- OH, YEAH, LIKE
WE BELIEVED YOU.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.051
- AW, THAT WAS PRICELESS,
COME ON.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.386
- DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

16:10.469 --> 16:12.012
THAT MAYBE HE WANTS
SOME PEACE AND QUIET?

16:19.311 --> 16:22.564
- HEY, YOU OKAY?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.401
- I CAN'T HELP THINKING
ABOUT WHY WE'RE REALLY HERE.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.319
- YEAH.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.238
- HEY, IT'LL WORK OUT.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.239
DON'T WORRY.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.741
- WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.536
MY GRANDPA SAID A GREAT EVIL
WAS ABOUT TO BE UNLEASHED.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.038
IF WE MESS THIS UP,
IT'S ON US.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.588
- I KEEP TELLING YOU,
THEY KNOW MORE THAN THEY SAY.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.590
WE MUST ASSUME THAT
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE--

16:48.674 --> 16:51.301
- UM, IN CASE
YOU'RE WONDERING,

16:51.385 --> 16:53.971
EDDIE AND KT
TOOK FABIAN TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.139
- HOSPITAL?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.140
- YEAH.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.016
YOU KNOW,
FABIAN HURT HIS HAND.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.893
EDDIE JUST PHONED ME.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.271
HE SAID THE PLACE
WAS REALLY, REALLY BUSY.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.105
- THANK YOU, PATRICIA.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.733
- THERE.

17:06.817 --> 17:10.154
I THINK WE CAN RULE EDDIE OUT
OF OUR INQUIRIES.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.160
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

17:16.242 --> 17:16.952
SORRY TO KEEP YOU.

17:17.035 --> 17:20.038
PARENTS, YOU ARE NOW FREE TO GO.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.290
PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO TELL
ALL YOUR FRIENDS

17:22.374 --> 17:25.711
WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE
YOU'VE HAD.

17:28.130 --> 17:28.881
- WHAT NOW?

17:28.964 --> 17:34.386
- NOW WE DO THINGS MY WAY.

17:37.222 --> 17:41.351
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY,
ALL OF YOU.

17:41.435 --> 17:47.107
NOW THAT OUR GUESTS HAVE GONE,
IT WILL BE BUSINESS AS USUAL.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.319
THERE WILL BE
A FULL AND THOROUGH SEARCH

17:50.402 --> 17:51.570
OF THE SCHOOL AND GROUNDS.

17:51.653 --> 17:56.283
AND WHEN I DISCOVER
WHO HAS TAKEN OUR PROPERTY,

17:56.366 --> 18:00.621
THEY WILL RUE THE DAY THEY EVER
SET FOOT IN THIS SCHOOL.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.835
- IT'S, LIKE, QUIET.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.753
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

18:07.836 --> 18:08.921
- STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.798
PATRICIA AND ALFIE WENT
BACK TO CHECK ON THEM.

18:10.881 --> 18:11.840
- OH, OKAY.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.967
- THINK I COULD
MOVE THIS PLANT?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.431
FENG SHUI IS ALL WRONG.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.432
- [scoffs]

18:20.516 --> 18:24.561
UM, SORRY?

18:24.645 --> 18:27.856
WILLOW IS YOUR NEW ROOMMATE.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.734
- OH, WOW.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.155
THAT'S GREAT, I GUESS.

18:35.239 --> 18:40.285
- I'M SURE WE'LL FIND THAT
WE'VE GOT THINGS IN COMMON.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.328
LOTS OF THINGS.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.345
- GUYS.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.598
IT'S TIME.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.101
- HEY, FINALLY.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.435
THOUGHT IT'D NEVER BE NIGHT.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.275
- ONLY A LITTLE LONGER NOW,
GREAT-GRANDPA.

19:11.358 --> 19:15.237
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.324
- I HARDLY THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE TANK IN THE SCHOOL.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.577
- WELL, HE HAS
TO BE SOMEWHERE.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.663
- PERHAPS IF YOU HAD TAKEN
ADEQUATE SECURITY MEASURES,

19:24.746 --> 19:26.248
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.584
- I TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.919
ONLY SOMEONE
WITH INSIDE KNOWLEDGE--

19:31.003 --> 19:33.922
- DENBY, CAN WE KEEP
ON LOOKING, PLEASE?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.799
- INSIDE KNOWLEDGE.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.968
IT WAS YOU TWO, WASN'T IT?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.303
- WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.388
- YOU WANT IT FOR YOURSELVES,
DON'T YOU?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.182
EVERYTHING THAT
ROBERT CAN OFFER.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.475
YOU'RE TRYING TO CUT ME OUT.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.101
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

19:46.184 --> 19:47.895
- I'LL FIND HIM.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.023
WHEREVER YOU'VE PUT HIM,
I'LL FIND HIM.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.324
- LET THE CEREMONY BEGIN.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.623
UM...

20:13.879 --> 20:16.632
- WHAT'S WRONG?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.675
- A LOT HARDER WORKING OUT
WHERE A BRACELET GOES

20:18.759 --> 20:19.801
WHEN THERE AREN'T ANY WRISTS.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.428
- HOW DID YOU GET TO BE
THE OSIRIAN AGAIN?

20:24.806 --> 20:28.852
- BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU DO
THAT WITH THOSE HANDKERCHIEFS?

20:30.604 --> 20:32.272
- MAGIC, DUDE.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.276
- WELL, WELL.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.324
- DO WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF
GREAT EVIL WE'RE LOOKING AT

20:42.407 --> 20:43.450
IF THIS THING GOES WRONG?

20:44.701 --> 20:46.703
- NOPE.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.373
- GOOD.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.166
JUST A QUESTION.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.521
[whooshing]

21:29.246 --> 21:33.166
[all chanting]

21:47.681 --> 21:48.557
HERE WE GO.

21:51.184 --> 21:51.518
HERE WE GO.

21:56.273 --> 21:56.314
[thunder booms]
