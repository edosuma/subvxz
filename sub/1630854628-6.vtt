-Uh-huh.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.403
I mean, I might wonder
if low geomagnetic activity

00:51.503 --> 00:53.283
is to blame for
the style of your dream,

00:53.383 --> 00:56.723
but, really, this couldn't be
a more straightforward reading.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.642
And how long will
the dream analysis take?

00:58.742 --> 01:01.362
Real life is so much more
complicated to understand.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.322
This could all be
a simulation.

01:03.422 --> 01:05.801
OK, can we simulate a helpful
end to the dream analysis?

01:05.902 --> 01:07.162
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

-(FEEDBACK SQUEALS)

01:51.539 --> 01:52.439
Ooh, sorry.

01:52.539 --> 01:54.679
Curiously, that, uh, also was

01:54.779 --> 01:56.718
the motivating factor in my app.

01:56.818 --> 02:02.038
Um, I was seeking help, uh
with an intimacy, uh, issue -

02:02.138 --> 02:06.638
and I mean that in a friendship,
not, um, in the bedroom -

02:06.738 --> 02:09.798
and, uh, I had met a gentleman
at the cinema

02:09.898 --> 02:11.237
and I wanted to
reconnect with him

02:11.337 --> 02:15.037
but had no way or no how,
in fact, to do that.

02:15.137 --> 02:19.077
And so, my son helped me -
who's joined us here today -

02:19.177 --> 02:20.797
code the app.

02:20.897 --> 02:24.397

and my, um, pet bird, Turtle.

02:44.695 --> 02:46.775
Any other questions?

Always. Always, Dad,
but you know what?

02:59.254 --> 03:02.274
I think people like an authentic
story behind their tech.

03:02.374 --> 03:04.114

more than anybody else.

really, really brutal out there.

find your brethren.

yourself getting cancelled

-Women?

03:55.550 --> 03:57.970
-Penis mutilations.
-No, but, um...

03:58.070 --> 03:59.730
-Well, it's gotta stop.
-Sure, any...

03:59.830 --> 04:03.650
-It's gotta stop.
-..mutilation needs cessation.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.050
What are you talking about?

04:05.150 --> 04:06.690
I'm talking about
the law of the jungle.

It's one rule for the alphas.

OK, what are you saying?

11:30.479 --> 11:32.699
I'm just agreeing with you
that her behaviour might be off

11:32.799 --> 11:33.899
and if she's lying to you...

11:33.999 --> 11:35.899
-I didn't say she was a liar.
-You just did.
