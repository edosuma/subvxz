00:30.698 --> 00:32.700
Malcolm!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.745
Malcolm, listen.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.414
Don't try to hide.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.417
I don't like it when you...

00:42.585 --> 00:46.297
Listen, if you don't
show yourself right now...

00:47.298 --> 00:49.091
Malcolm!

00:49.175 --> 00:53.179
I've been looking for you all over
for two days now.

00:57.308 --> 00:59.769
Malcolm the Maggot has vanished!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.399
<i>I'm singing...</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:53.823
Children, time for school!

01:54.031 --> 01:56.992
To school now, quickly!

02:31.569 --> 02:34.864
Juniper!
- Rolli! Don't scare people like that!

02:35.030 --> 02:37.867
Malcolm the Maggot has vanished.

02:39.577 --> 02:44.123
ROLLI AND THE SECRET OF ALL TIME

03:27.166 --> 03:28.876
Help!

03:38.385 --> 03:41.472
I'm going to be fish food!

03:48.771 --> 03:51.607
I told you not to mess with me!

03:51.774 --> 03:55.986
You were lucky not to get
into a fight with me!

03:56.946 --> 04:01.659
Malcolm the Maggot's great adventure
will remain in history books!

04:11.794 --> 04:16.130
Hey! Whoa!
Time to make a U-turn!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.384
Stooooop!

04:19.093 --> 04:23.639
Fly for your life! Otherwise
we are former maggot and crow!

04:23.806 --> 04:26.976
Take the straightest route
to Rolli Village!

04:28.644 --> 04:32.022
<i>La-la-la I'm singing</i>

04:32.147 --> 04:35.526
<i>La-la-la I'm singing</i>

04:44.576 --> 04:49.081
Rolli! You just ogle there
while others are making art!

04:49.248 --> 04:51.792
I trust you have an explanation?

04:53.002 --> 04:57.965
Well...
Malcolm the Maggot has vanished.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.677
We haven't seen him for two days.
His hole is near the brook.

05:01.844 --> 05:05.431
Rolli fears he has fallen in
and become fish food.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.851
What are you talking about?
Malcolm who? What maggot?

05:09.018 --> 05:13.522
I remember Rolli talking about him.
The small, green...

05:18.402 --> 05:21.947
Ah, Malcolm the Great!

05:22.114 --> 05:27.119
That tiny worm
Rolli thought was a dragon!

05:27.244 --> 05:30.247
Worm!
- Don't make fun of him.

05:30.706 --> 05:34.043
You must speak of Malcolm the Great
with respect.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.671
And now Malcolm the Maggot is gone.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.271
Hey!
- Malcolm!

05:54.438 --> 05:56.190
Holy smokes!

05:57.024 --> 06:00.736
The end of the world is near!
Come quickly!

06:01.612 --> 06:05.282
If news of this spreads,
there'll be mass hysteria!

06:06.241 --> 06:10.037
It's important to keep this
within the headquarters for now.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.414
Within the executive team!

06:12.915 --> 06:15.501
Executive team?
- That's us!

06:16.251 --> 06:18.170
Stay back!

06:18.337 --> 06:21.006
We have an emergency.
Everything will be fine

06:21.173 --> 06:24.259
as long as you stay calm
and avoid mass hysteria!

06:24.426 --> 06:28.555
Mass hysteria!
Is there cause for concern?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.392
A-at l-least I'm not afraid!

06:31.558 --> 06:35.020
The sun is setting
and the day is coming to an end.

06:35.187 --> 06:39.108
Evening chores, everyone,
and then it's bedtime!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.527
Step on it!

06:41.652 --> 06:44.822
Get ready for bed, everyone!
You heard it.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.782
Move it!

06:50.327 --> 06:52.913
And then I saw it.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.958
Luckily the old, loyal crow
had followed me...

06:56.041 --> 06:59.253
Hold on, Malcolm...
What did you see?

06:59.420 --> 07:03.757
I'm not sure what it was.
Some sort of reptile, I guess.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.554
Perhaps even my cousin, except
it was humongously bigger than me.

07:08.679 --> 07:13.767
How much bigger?
- I can't say an exact figure,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.937
but I would estimate... I'd say...

07:17.104 --> 07:21.733
A hundred... two hundred...
three hundred million times my size.

07:21.859 --> 07:26.196
Maybe even bigger.
- So, tell us...

07:26.363 --> 07:29.908
Where did you see
this big cousin of yours?

07:30.075 --> 07:32.828
At the Beginning of All Time.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.956
The place where the storks come from.

07:36.123 --> 07:41.170
Storks? I fell from a stork's beak
in a small bundle. So did you, Rolli.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.006
I fell from an old crow's beak.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.843
I had no first class flight,
you know.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.096
The Beginning of All Time!

07:54.349 --> 07:58.812
That's where we came from!
We have to get ready for the trip!

07:58.896 --> 08:02.691
Tomorrow we head for
the Beginning of All Time!

08:02.858 --> 08:08.906
No, juniper. Malcolm might have been
hallucinating.

08:09.031 --> 08:14.161
I don't hallucinate!
But the journey is dangerous.

08:14.328 --> 08:18.457
You'd have to cross Eternal Mountains
and Eternal Desert,

08:18.540 --> 08:22.085
go through Eternal Forest,
and cross the Endless Sea.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.672
Come on, now.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.063
I'm staying in Rolli Village.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.858
This is my home.

08:45.651 --> 08:49.071
It's good to be inside these walls.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.959
When I was just a tiny bundle,

09:02.459 --> 09:06.004
I lived and hid in this box
all summer and all winter.

09:06.171 --> 09:10.300
I peeked at others from here.
Without even knowing who I am.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.387
But you have a home now!

09:14.680 --> 09:18.141
And we're all one big family.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.436
One big family!

09:21.603 --> 09:23.605
That's right.

09:24.231 --> 09:29.278
Rolli Village finally became my home
and I couldn't have a better one.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.198
And I couldn't have
a better friend than you, Rolli.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.867
But still I...

09:36.785 --> 09:41.999
If only you understood me.
- I do understand you.

09:42.165 --> 09:47.421
The stork whose beak I fell from...
Where was she coming from?

09:47.588 --> 09:51.216
I'm sure the answer awaits
at the Beginning of All Time.

09:51.383 --> 09:56.930
I must know where I came from.
We can make the journey.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.392
We all wonder where we come from

10:00.517 --> 10:03.854
and what the meaning
of everything is.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.484
<i>Yes, but...
- Everybody wonders</i>

10:09.651 --> 10:12.946
<i>what life has in store</i>

10:13.655 --> 10:16.491
<i>Some feel down and blue</i>

10:16.658 --> 10:19.620
<i>Others like to laugh more</i>

10:20.329 --> 10:23.498
<i>Some have pretty songs to sing</i>

10:23.624 --> 10:26.668
<i>Others make nice paintings</i>

10:26.877 --> 10:30.547
<i>And others just chuckle away</i>

10:30.756 --> 10:33.592
<i>Yeah yeah, I see</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:36.678
<i>Uh huh...
- That's the purpose of it all</i>

10:37.304 --> 10:40.223
<i>Yeah yeah, I see</i>

10:40.390 --> 10:43.810
<i>Uh huh...
- That's the purpose of it all</i>

10:48.398 --> 10:53.487
Listen,juniper.
We can't embark on such a journey.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.615
I'm not a young boy any more.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.910
The whole thing sounds...

11:01.203 --> 11:04.414
You're afraid!
- Now listen...

11:04.581 --> 11:08.251
You sure talk the talk.
Telling tales at campfire.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.296
When push comes to shove,
you want to hide.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.965
Wha... what...

11:14.132 --> 11:16.718
You don't dare face that big reptile!

11:17.260 --> 11:19.721
I don't fear anything!
- You do!

11:19.888 --> 11:21.807
No!
- Do too!

11:21.973 --> 11:24.351
I am the terrible Rolli!

11:24.518 --> 11:29.064
Prove it! Come with me to look for
the Beginning of All Time.

11:29.231 --> 11:35.112
Listen,juniper.
I hate to make you sad, but...

11:35.278 --> 11:39.908
There's no point in looking
for something we can never find.

11:40.075 --> 11:44.329
That's right!
- All your questions have no answer.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.290
No matter how hard you look.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.919
You won't find
the Beginning of All Time.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.424
Fine. I'll go alone.

11:55.590 --> 12:00.053
See you when I get back.
Unless I stay where I came from.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.394
I guess there's nothing else to do.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.772
Don't do anything reckless, Rolli!

12:11.314 --> 12:14.192
You can't intervene with this,
Malcolm.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.822
Juniper!

12:20.031 --> 12:24.035
Juniper! We'll start
travel preparations straightaway.

12:26.037 --> 12:30.500
And at the break of dawn
we'll embark on an exploration.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.553
And you, Malcolm,
can tell us the route.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.475
You say we have to climb
over the Eternal Mountains?

12:46.850 --> 12:50.645
<i>Over Eternal Mountains,
across the desert, too</i>

12:50.812 --> 12:54.566
<i>Through Eternal Forest,
that's the route</i>

12:54.733 --> 12:59.029
<i>I'm Malcolm the Maggot,
follow me if you dare</i>

12:59.196 --> 13:02.616
<i>I'm a brave adventurer</i>

13:11.208 --> 13:15.253
<i>Bring your map and your compass
Your ice pick, too</i>

13:15.420 --> 13:18.799
<i>Don't forget to bring enough food</i>

13:19.341 --> 13:23.804
<i>Take enough to drink
or you'll dry up and shrink</i>

13:24.012 --> 13:27.516
<i>Hear what I say
and you'll be on your way</i>

13:43.448 --> 13:47.744
<i>That monster is gigantic
Guzzling water like he's frantic</i>

13:47.911 --> 13:51.706
<i>But it never touches stronger stuff</i>

13:51.873 --> 13:56.127
<i>He inspires fear and terror
With his mighty fangs</i>

13:56.294 --> 13:59.422
<i>His skin on my wall would be enough</i>

14:19.860 --> 14:25.031
Rolli!
What on earth are you looking for?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.951
Good thing you woke up.

14:28.577 --> 14:32.622
Listen, I need mountaineering gear.

14:32.789 --> 14:37.544
You know, wedges and hooks
and that kind of stuff.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.714
What do you need them for?
- Mountain climbing.

14:43.466 --> 14:47.053
I have a new hobby.
I plan to climb...

14:48.263 --> 14:53.226
My plan is to climb
on top of that boulder.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.688
And further on to the roof of my hut.

15:00.775 --> 15:04.487
I don't quite get it.
- Uh-huh?

15:04.654 --> 15:07.949
Don't you know how to make
the necessary gear?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.911
I know how, alright.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.999
Wedges...

15:35.101 --> 15:36.895
Juniper!

15:37.020 --> 15:39.648
This early in the morning?
Is everything OK?

15:39.814 --> 15:44.486
Yes. I just want some fishing hooks.
I heard you have some.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.739
Yes...
- And some fishing line. And spices.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.951
At least Rolli pepper and salt.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.954
And a few apples.
- We'll have breakfast soon.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.123
Yes, but Rolli and I
are taking a trip.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.502
We are terribly hungry
and have no time for breakfast.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.214
A trip, you say?

16:09.386 --> 16:12.013
Can I make soup with this then?

16:25.610 --> 16:30.573
I'll tell Blacksmith this will be
the last time he starts so early...

16:30.740 --> 16:33.910
The clothesline! Where has it gone?

16:39.416 --> 16:41.376
Thieves, maybe?

16:44.421 --> 16:47.048
I... I took the rope.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.303
I needed it because...

16:53.096 --> 16:55.765
Rolli has taken up mountaineering.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.644
These are all ready.

17:00.228 --> 17:05.442
That was fast. That's good
because we're pressed for time.

17:05.733 --> 17:11.448
Rolli, tell us what you're up to.
- Count on me and juniper.

17:13.116 --> 17:17.662
Juniper!
juniper, it's time to go!

17:17.829 --> 17:21.332
I demand to know where you are going.

17:21.499 --> 17:25.336
You could tell us a little more
about your intentions.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.174
We'll warm up by climbing
to the peak of Eternal Mountain.

17:29.340 --> 17:34.262
We might see Malcolm the Maggot's
big cousin up there.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.393
I thought Malcolm would have come
to bid us farewell.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.271
I guess he's sleeping in his hole.

17:43.438 --> 17:47.025
Maybe you should reconsider?
- Why not use the gate?

17:47.192 --> 17:49.194
It's open.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.615
Great adventurers
never take the easy way.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.202
When I was younger,
I always took off with this catapult.

17:57.410 --> 18:03.291
So, Big Rolli.
Pull the lever when I say, "Go!"

19:01.141 --> 19:04.936
Eternal Mountains
should be somewhere... over there.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.737
Take a look.

19:51.065 --> 19:53.651
There they are!

19:58.448 --> 20:02.619
Let's make camp here
and continue in the morning.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.208
Take my knapsack...

21:04.180 --> 21:09.060
<i>If you cross that unknown mountain</i>

21:10.228 --> 21:14.649
<i>You may enter a frightening world</i>

21:14.816 --> 21:20.029
<i>Even if your past is new to you</i>

21:20.196 --> 21:24.701
<i>The future's more important still</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:30.707
<i>The future's more important still</i>

21:30.873 --> 21:35.503
<i>The future's more important still</i>

21:35.878 --> 21:38.631
<i>More important still</i>

21:41.426 --> 21:46.764
<i>It's not enough just to be brave</i>

21:47.473 --> 21:52.145
<i>You're on your way to the unknown</i>

21:52.729 --> 21:57.650
<i>You can't just walk
to the beginning of time</i>

21:58.151 --> 22:02.113
<i>Turn back while you can</i>

22:03.156 --> 22:07.118
<i>Turn back while you can</i>

22:08.578 --> 22:12.123
<i>Turn back while you can</i>

22:13.207 --> 22:15.960
<i>While you can</i>

22:20.423 --> 22:23.801
Tiny bugs like that don't scare me.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.492
I won't give up.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.455
Maybe we have to find another route.
- There is no other route.

23:34.539 --> 23:38.292
We just have to keep pushing on.

23:52.682 --> 23:58.396
Perhaps...
a little rest will do you good.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.857
You seem out of breath.

24:10.741 --> 24:15.413
Juniper... We can't do this.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.291
We have to go back.
- You can't be serious!

24:18.458 --> 24:21.043
What other choice do we have?

24:29.510 --> 24:32.096
At least we tried, juniper.

24:32.805 --> 24:38.352
Sometimes you have to give in
to the impossible.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.316
I shouldn't put you to peril, anyway.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.944
You're still young and...

24:49.989 --> 24:53.451
Malcolm the Maggot!
- I knew you'd need me.

24:53.618 --> 24:56.579
This is exactly
that sort of a moment.

24:59.290 --> 25:04.128
You won't take me...
I'll tame you!

25:25.650 --> 25:30.821
Take the rope in your beak.
We'll help those two up.

25:51.259 --> 25:54.345
Hold on tight!

26:00.101 --> 26:02.853
We'll be crushed!

26:21.497 --> 26:24.292
That was some stunt you pulled,
Maggot.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.628
Is that how you thank me
for the ride?

26:27.753 --> 26:32.174
You should get to the other side
of the mountain through that rain.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.594
To the Eternal Desert.

26:36.512 --> 26:40.266
What about you?
- I won't go any further.

26:40.349 --> 26:44.270
I'm freezing and dizzy.
I'm flying home.

26:44.353 --> 26:48.149
Cross your fingers
my ride doesn't get hungry.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.304
It's snowing!

27:45.373 --> 27:47.750
Rolli!

27:51.045 --> 27:53.130
Rolli?

27:57.927 --> 27:59.970
Juniper?

28:10.231 --> 28:15.152
Juniper! juniper! Where did you...

28:16.070 --> 28:18.155
Juniper!

28:33.587 --> 28:35.673
My hat!

29:04.910 --> 29:07.037
Sand?

29:09.498 --> 29:15.045
Sudden changes in temperature
are tough on someone my age.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.598
I wonder which way we should go?

29:25.765 --> 29:28.267
Juniper!
_ Yes?

29:28.434 --> 29:32.938
We made it over the mountain. We can
congratulate ourselves for that.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.692
But I don't think
we'll make it any further.

29:36.776 --> 29:40.780
What are you saying?
- If we try to cross that desert

29:40.946 --> 29:45.451
without knowing the way...
- We'll try as long as we find it.

29:45.576 --> 29:50.331
It can't be done! We'll be parched
and baked to crackers.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.835
I don't like crackers. juniper!

30:58.774 --> 31:01.861
Drink sparingly.

31:01.986 --> 31:05.531
The last drop will be the end of us.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.242
What's that?

31:17.459 --> 31:20.754
I am Ca Mél, ship of the desert.

31:20.838 --> 31:24.008
Your connecting transport
across the desert.

31:24.174 --> 31:29.096
Good of you to come,
for you are my first passengers

31:29.179 --> 31:31.891
in a long, long time.

31:32.016 --> 31:36.395
Hop on, and I'll take you
to the other edge of the desert.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.733
I guess that will...
- ...be alright.

31:41.275 --> 31:45.404
My knee is a bit sore,
and this kneeling is not...

31:50.659 --> 31:54.079
Everything good up there?

31:55.247 --> 31:58.667
Dilly-be-dabby-dibby-dabby...

33:07.444 --> 33:12.533
Land ho!
- I know where we are.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.580
It's a forest!
And where there is forest...

33:18.747 --> 33:22.209
...there are cones, too!
- Water.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.378
Yes.

33:35.055 --> 33:38.392
All right, then. Here we are.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.771
So you're heading
for the Endless Sea?

33:42.938 --> 33:46.608
Yes.
My friend Malcolm the Maggot told us

33:46.775 --> 33:50.612
the Beginning of All Time
is on the other side of it.

33:50.738 --> 33:54.616
Maggot? - juniper believes
we could get there.

33:55.075 --> 33:59.621
Continue along that path and
you will get to the Eternal River.

33:59.747 --> 34:04.918
There you'll meet the Bridgekeeper.
- Wait. Who's the Bridgekeeper?

34:05.169 --> 34:07.421
Adios.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.732
Look at that!

35:21.745 --> 35:26.041
Oh, how beautiful! We can't eat it.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.341
I get so sentimental in your company.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.219
Go on, then!

35:43.684 --> 35:47.146
Phew, how ugly! That we can eat.

35:47.312 --> 35:52.234
I didn't know you choose your food
by its face.

36:05.122 --> 36:08.333
Yuck! This tastes horrible.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.878
You mustn't say that about food.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.422
One must be honest, after all.

36:14.381 --> 36:17.342
What if someone said
you taste horrible?

36:18.927 --> 36:21.221
Tangy Rolli.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.393
What...?

36:31.064 --> 36:36.862
Maybe we should move along?
- No! If we stay close to the fire,

36:37.279 --> 36:39.573
that stalking beast won't attack.

36:41.783 --> 36:45.871
I hope you're right.
- So do I.

36:50.209 --> 36:53.295
Let's try to get some sleep
in spite of it.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.408
I guess the nightly beast has gone.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.956
Otherwise it would've eaten us up
while we were sleeping.

37:29.122 --> 37:32.751
But I am terrifying also in my sleep.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.338
My snoring is spine-chilling.

37:41.510 --> 37:45.097
Listen! Like giants walking.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.268
I wouldn't mind
even if it was a giant.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.895
Let him come here if he dares.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.775
The nightly beast is back!

38:01.029 --> 38:02.364
A hedgehog?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.333
Hello, wanderers.

38:18.171 --> 38:21.758
And who might you be?
- I'm Henry the Hedgehog.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.136
The bridgekeeper.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.182
We humbly ask permission
to cross your bridge.

38:29.391 --> 38:33.020
I will give permission
when I know who you are...

38:33.186 --> 38:36.857
I am juniper and I want to see
the Beginning of All Time.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.359
The place where the storks come from.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.112
I am the terrible Rolli and...

38:42.321 --> 38:47.242
He wants to see the giant reptile
Malcolm the Maggot talked about.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.787
Yes... the...

38:50.954 --> 38:53.749
Yes, the lizard. Donnysau...

38:53.915 --> 38:55.959
Dannysau...
- Dinosaur.

38:56.126 --> 38:59.546
Yes, the kind of a creature
who is approximately...

38:59.713 --> 39:04.009
...one hundred million times bigger
than my friend Malcolm the Maggot.

39:04.176 --> 39:08.597
And he is
the size of my index finger.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.393
To be perfectly honest,

39:13.560 --> 39:19.149
I can tell you I don't believe
in the Last Dinosaur.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.235
I don't believe he actually exists.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.113
What are those noises then?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.532
Ah, that noise?

39:27.657 --> 39:30.452
It comes from the Floating Rocks.

39:31.912 --> 39:38.502
On that side of the forest
there is nothing but the Endless Sea.

39:38.668 --> 39:43.256
There is a column of rocks
that bang against each other.

39:43.465 --> 39:46.259
How can rocks float?
- That's right.

39:46.343 --> 39:50.514
Fairytales!
- What's behind those rocks?

39:51.306 --> 39:54.142
There is nothing after them.

39:54.309 --> 39:59.231
Besides, the journey from here on
is very dangerous.

39:59.439 --> 40:02.275
Why don't you just return home?

40:03.193 --> 40:08.198
Juniper, I think
Henry the Hedgehog is right.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.742
Perhaps we...
- How can you say that?

40:11.743 --> 40:14.579
Fine! I'll travel faster
without you, anyway.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.417
You go back to Rolli Village
and I'll carry on.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.007
That girl will be the death of me!

40:27.259 --> 40:28.844
Juniper!

40:40.105 --> 40:43.525
I really hope you'll find
what you're looking for.

40:45.277 --> 40:48.738
But what if there's nothing there?

40:49.114 --> 40:52.492
Behind the floating rocks, I mean.

40:52.659 --> 40:55.203
Or there is something, after all.

40:55.370 --> 40:58.498
I couldn't very well encourage her
to keep going.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.750
But I couldn't forbid her, either.

41:00.917 --> 41:05.755
And who knows? You might see
your terrible reptile, too.

41:26.234 --> 41:32.240
Just a few important things more.
Very, very important ones.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.202
Quickly then! I'm in a hurry!

42:56.157 --> 42:58.743
Is there room on your vessel?

43:00.495 --> 43:03.373
I would like to see
the Beginning of All Time.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.167
This is
just a piece of bark and wood.

43:06.334 --> 43:10.755
If there's room or not depends on
how sturdy this will be.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.092
Could I help you?

44:13.526 --> 44:18.448
The Floating Rocks! - The ones
Henry the Hedgehog mentioned.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.715
Juniper, sit down!

44:43.014 --> 44:46.601
You are my best friend!
- And you are mine!

45:16.673 --> 45:19.008
We made it, juniper!

45:26.349 --> 45:29.018
We really made it.

45:30.979 --> 45:35.066
Look! The water is different colour
than before the rocks.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.321
And look there!

45:43.491 --> 45:46.828
That must be
the Beginning of All Time.

45:48.037 --> 45:52.417
Now all we must do is sail
straight toward the horizon.

45:52.876 --> 45:56.045
We must not deviate from our course.

45:56.504 --> 45:59.174
Where could we deviate to?

46:02.135 --> 46:05.930
I don't know, but that's what
Henry the Hedgehog said.

46:07.557 --> 46:10.435
"If you make it through
the Floating Rocks,

46:10.602 --> 46:14.439
you're on the final stretch
toward the Beginning of All Time."

46:15.023 --> 46:17.859
"just don't deviate
from your course."

46:18.443 --> 46:20.403
"No matter what happens,

46:20.487 --> 46:24.616
you must continue
straight toward the horizon."

46:25.533 --> 46:28.244
So he knew more
than he wanted to say?

46:28.411 --> 46:30.914
He just wanted to protect us.

46:31.289 --> 46:35.543
He thought
we should have turned around.

46:36.419 --> 46:40.757
He called you raving mad
for crossing the gorge.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.551
You came across, too!
- Yes.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.721
Well,
he called me raving mad as well.

46:46.930 --> 46:49.599
What's so mad about raving?

46:51.601 --> 46:55.146
The Beginning of All Time,
here we come!

47:49.534 --> 47:51.536
<i>Rolli...</i>

47:52.036 --> 47:54.038
<i>Rolli!</i>

48:01.671 --> 48:03.631
<i>Come here!</i>

48:03.798 --> 48:05.425
<i>Rolli, come.</i>

48:05.592 --> 48:07.719
It's coming from that islet.

48:07.886 --> 48:10.680
<i>Rolli, deviate from your course.</i>

48:10.847 --> 48:13.725
<i>Rolli, what is it?
- Deviate from your course.</i>

48:13.892 --> 48:16.060
What are you doing?

48:16.227 --> 48:20.148
I'm steering a bit closer.
- You said we mustn't deviate.

48:20.315 --> 48:22.984
Of course not.
I'm just steering closer.

48:23.359 --> 48:26.654
<i>Deviate from your course, Rolli.</i>

48:31.784 --> 48:34.537
She's... just like...

48:34.704 --> 48:37.290
...an elf maiden!

48:38.124 --> 48:41.461
Just like Millie the Elf.

48:43.338 --> 48:46.341
<i>I'm a prisoner of Misty Island</i>

48:46.549 --> 48:49.719
<i>Forever shall I remain here</i>

48:49.886 --> 48:55.725
<i>Even though
I don't like this place at all</i>

48:57.894 --> 49:00.855
<i>I'd like to get away from here</i>

49:01.064 --> 49:05.193
<i>anywhere else would be prettier...
- Rolli! Hello?</i>

49:05.360 --> 49:09.238
<i>But I'm afraid
I'll never find the way</i>

49:26.547 --> 49:30.134
<i>Oh, can no one think</i>

49:30.468 --> 49:33.596
<i>beautiful thoughts anymore?</i>

49:33.763 --> 49:38.351
<i>That's the only way
you could save us</i>

49:40.645 --> 49:44.232
<i>If you could try to do it anyhow</i>

49:44.357 --> 49:47.735
<i>You'd make me so happy</i>

49:47.902 --> 49:52.782
<i>And our land would turn
pretty and lush</i>

49:57.203 --> 49:59.747
We have to go and help them!

50:12.927 --> 50:17.557
Don't worry, we come as friends!
We'll take you with us.

50:17.724 --> 50:21.936
Our raft is small,
but there's always room for one.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.190
Well, two.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.625
Where...?

50:45.043 --> 50:47.170
Where did they go?

50:53.885 --> 50:56.846
Wait! Stop!

51:11.819 --> 51:13.780
As truly as my name is Rolli, -

51:13.863 --> 51:17.366
I say we've done enough climbing!

51:17.533 --> 51:20.745
Don't get agitated.
- We demand an explanation!

51:23.456 --> 51:25.416
Travellers...

51:25.583 --> 51:29.545
Look, the Beginning of All Time
is over there.

51:30.963 --> 51:36.302
Of course we know that.
- Yes, that's where we were heading.

51:36.469 --> 51:40.681
But still you stopped. You knew
you mustn't deviate from your course.

51:41.224 --> 51:44.310
By my dirty...

51:44.477 --> 51:46.604
...clean toes...

51:47.855 --> 51:52.777
You seemed nice.
We just wanted to help you.

51:59.742 --> 52:03.704
I don't think that was the reason
you steered toward the island.

52:08.209 --> 52:11.504
Listen, you must understand this:

52:11.838 --> 52:16.467
You are real. You are responsible
for your decisions.

52:17.844 --> 52:20.054
We don't even exist.

52:21.097 --> 52:23.683
You're standing right there!
- No.

52:23.850 --> 52:27.854
The Eternal Islet itself makes
travellers change their course.

52:29.063 --> 52:35.653
Some see this as gold and diamonds
and others as various figures.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.905
The islet is a mirror of your soul.

52:37.989 --> 52:40.491
It shows
the true meaning of your trip.

52:40.992 --> 52:43.870
It determines
if your journey can continue.

52:44.036 --> 52:46.706
But we just wanted to help...

52:46.873 --> 52:49.625
Yes. Honestly we did.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.712
Well, perhaps your help is needed.

52:53.129 --> 52:56.132
Perhaps that's the actual purpose
of your journey.

53:06.475 --> 53:08.477
Where did they...?

53:11.731 --> 53:14.609
We're too tired, juniper.

53:14.775 --> 53:19.238
They were just a mirage.
Hallucinations.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.372
Whose hallucinations are they?

53:30.833 --> 53:32.960
Hey. don't go!

53:41.761 --> 53:43.930
How can there be children here?

53:44.096 --> 53:47.475
Listen, tell us if you're real
or an illusion?

53:48.184 --> 53:50.186
Who are you?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.482
I asked you who you were.

53:54.649 --> 53:57.693
Would you have the courtesy
to answer, please?

53:57.860 --> 53:59.904
We don't know.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.073
How come you don't know?

54:02.240 --> 54:05.243
We fell from the sky
in small bundles.

54:05.326 --> 54:07.578
The storks were caught in a storm.

54:07.662 --> 54:10.831
Some made it
but others dropped their bundles.

54:10.998 --> 54:16.045
We're the ones who fell here.
- That's all we know about ourselves.

54:16.212 --> 54:19.131
But... where is your home?

54:19.632 --> 54:23.636
This is our home.
- Though it wasn't meant to be.

54:24.512 --> 54:27.515
We cannot get away.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.893
Do you have names?
- Who could I be.

54:31.227 --> 54:35.606
I asked if you have names.
- You heard them already.

54:35.731 --> 54:39.610
When we were younger,
we kept asking ourselves

54:39.777 --> 54:43.072
and each other,
"Who could I be?"

54:43.239 --> 54:46.617
And named ourselves accordingly.
- I am Who.

54:46.784 --> 54:49.036
I am Could.
- I am I.

54:49.203 --> 54:51.956
Hello, strangers! I am Be.

54:52.665 --> 54:55.876
Hello, Who, Could, I and Be.

54:56.043 --> 55:00.089
Now you know our names and our story.
It's your turn to tell us

55:00.172 --> 55:04.051
who you are, where you come from
and where you are going.

55:06.721 --> 55:09.307
I am Juniper.
- And I am I.

55:09.515 --> 55:11.183
I am I!

55:11.350 --> 55:14.937
I am Rolli.
We come from Rolli Village.

55:15.104 --> 55:16.939
It's our home.

55:17.106 --> 55:20.443
And now we're on our way
to the Beginning of All Time.

55:23.487 --> 55:26.282
You're lucky to have a real home.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.826
Rolli Village sounds like one.

55:28.993 --> 55:32.288
It is.
It's a wonderful place to live.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.707
You can take us there!

55:34.832 --> 55:38.836
I want to see the Beginning of
All Time! - It's not possible.

55:38.961 --> 55:42.923
No one has managed
to pass the Guardian of All Time.

55:44.675 --> 55:48.971
Who's he, then?
- A huge lizard.

55:49.764 --> 55:53.225
So you believe
the lizard actually exists?

55:53.392 --> 55:57.938
We've seen it many times.
- The giant thing rises from the sea

55:58.022 --> 56:01.359
to threaten those who try
to travel across the sea.

56:01.567 --> 56:04.653
He calls himself the Last Dinosaur.

56:07.490 --> 56:11.160
I know! I'm sure we'll get there
in your company.

56:11.327 --> 56:13.037
What do you mean?

56:13.204 --> 56:16.332
Let's all leave the islet
and travel there together.

56:16.916 --> 56:20.669
You don't get it. If there's
a real home for us somewhere,

56:20.836 --> 56:23.047
that's where we want to go.

56:23.214 --> 56:25.383
Now listen, everybody.

56:25.591 --> 56:28.594
Not one of us is sailing
anywhere today.

56:29.095 --> 56:33.265
The sun is setting
and we can't go out on the dark sea.

56:34.517 --> 56:37.061
Let's sleep on it. In the morning

56:37.186 --> 56:40.314
juniper and I will continue
to the Beginning of All Time.

56:40.523 --> 56:44.527
Once we've seen it, we'll come back
and take you with us.

56:44.693 --> 56:50.116
Would that be OK?
- We think it's a very good idea.

56:50.241 --> 56:53.202
You can sleep in our camp.
just follow us.

57:27.862 --> 57:30.364
This is where we live.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.617
How nice!

57:36.287 --> 57:38.080
Yes...

57:38.247 --> 57:42.460
At least it's a lot nicer
than the wooden box I lived in.

57:44.003 --> 57:46.839
Actually
we would get along just fine.

57:47.006 --> 57:51.177
The sea is full of fish and up there
is a spring with fresh water.

57:51.343 --> 57:54.096
But the nights are terribly cold.

57:54.597 --> 58:00.060
It's getting cold already.
I guess it's best to make a fire.

58:19.497 --> 58:23.334
I don't mind
if my tail catches fire...

59:06.335 --> 59:12.758
Where <i>on earth</i> could Could <i>be?
- Hey, come quickly! Come on!</i>

59:14.635 --> 59:16.637
<i>This is fun!</i>

59:21.100 --> 59:24.562
<i>Come and see, quickly! I can sail!</i>

59:26.313 --> 59:29.149
<i>I don't know how to steer this!</i>

59:29.775 --> 59:32.152
Help me!

59:32.319 --> 59:34.572
Jump, Could!
- No!

59:34.655 --> 59:39.326
He's a good swimmer.
- Then we'll lose our boat!

59:39.493 --> 59:42.246
We'll stay here forever!
-jump!

59:42.413 --> 59:45.499
Listen, Could! Turn the sail!

59:45.666 --> 59:47.751
Half a turn that way...

59:47.918 --> 59:50.212
No! The other way!
-jump!

59:50.379 --> 59:52.423
Listen! Concentrate!

59:52.590 --> 59:57.428
Jump!
- Otherwise you can't swim to shore!

59:57.595 --> 59:59.555
Jump!

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.559
No!

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:20.117
I ruined everything.
I couldn't help trying it out.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:23.954
I didn't mean it.
- The main thing is you're OK.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.332
That was excellent swimming.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:31.003
Rolli and I will figure...

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:35.341
Rolli!

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:52.900
Rolli!
- Everything under control!

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:55.861
I'll bring the boat back.

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:58.238
Watch out!

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.699
Watch out!

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:02.451
Rolli, watch out!

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:22.471
BY my dirty toes!

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.474
You are real, really!

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.603
Turn back quickly!
- No!

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:33.232
I must encounter him face to face!

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:44.576
Now, listen.
We have come here as friends.

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:49.081
Actually I came here
just to meet you.

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:51.208
Let's chitchat.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.460
Rolli!

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:59.508
Listen! You scared the living
daylights out of my friend Malcolm,

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:02.219
but you won't scare me!

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:10.978
Rolli!

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.315
I was only kidding with you!

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:22.740
Save yourselves, if you can!

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.159
Go, go!

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:26.994
Rolli!

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.247
Look!

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.998
Juniper, get back!

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:16.210
Never! I'll help you tame him.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:20.422
No! It will take tough measures
to tame this guy.

01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:23.175
Stay farther back, that's an order!

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:36.313
I know how to handle big blokes.

01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:07.803
I am the terrible Rolli.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.812
Juniper!
- Come at me if you dare!

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:19.064
No, juniper! Stay...

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.068
No!

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.698
Blooming blue blisters!

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:30.826
No!

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:34.580
Rolli!

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:45.340
Yee-haa! Here I come!

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:49.469
Malcolm! You were going home.
What are you flying there for?

01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:54.391
The Old Crow came to me and said
you really were crossing the sea.

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:58.729
It wasn't hard to guess
you'd be in trouble once again.

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:03.734
But let's talk later.
Now I must take care of a dinosaur!

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:07.654
Do it quickly.
- Hold on tight in the meantime!

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.281
That's my intention.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.950
<i>The Last of the Dinosaurs,</i>

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:15.495
<i>I surely know him well</i>

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:17.664
<i>The size of this islet of ours,</i>

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:23.045
<i>the Last of the Dinosaurs</i>

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.755
Rolli!

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.593
<i>His legs are like columns</i>

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.304
<i>and he's got a scaly skin</i>

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:35.390
<i>Each eye is like a saucer</i>

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:40.062
<i>but the size of a wash basin</i>

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.361
<i>Sometimes this huge dinosaur</i>

01:05:47.486 --> 01:05:50.447
<i>can be lonesome, too</i>

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.325
<i>That's why I sure hope</i>

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:59.790
<i>he would make friends
with me and you</i>

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:03.835
You'll be alright! I promise!

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:10.884
I'm losing my hold!
- No!

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:14.179
Yes!
_

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:37.285
You made it! Malcolm the Maggot
and the Dinosaur rescued you!

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.579
I could have made it myself.

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.915
No, you wouldn't have.
- Yes, I would.

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:45.585
No way you would have.
- Yes way I would've.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.380
No, I wouldn't.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.855
Hey! Over here!

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:11.069
Is everything OK, Rolli?
- Yes!

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:15.449
And thank you. You saved me.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:18.660
My friend and I did it together.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:22.914
And now... may I offer you a ride?

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.626
You?
- Or actually him.

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:35.135
He happens to be the fore-grandfather
of my grandfathers,

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:38.305
and we get along just fine.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:44.394
He's just performing his duty by
protecting the Beginning of All Time.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:47.481
Would he really give us a ride?

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:51.318
Of course!
- What about us?

01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:55.447
My friend is strong enough to carry
the whole team, if necessary.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:59.034
We wouldn't leave you behind
at any price.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.622
Where are we going?
Isn't this the wrong way?

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:49.000
We're heading for
the Beginning of All Time.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.671
The Dinosaur said
he can let us all in

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:56.006
because your minds are clearly pure.

01:08:56.174 --> 01:09:00.554
I'm not sure if he remembered
to peek into my mind...

01:09:02.514 --> 01:09:04.515
But we thought...

01:09:04.683 --> 01:09:07.810
We'll pay a quick visit and
then go to Rolli Village.

01:09:07.978 --> 01:09:12.274
Bu Juniper... - We're so close!
Why shouldn't we go?

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.611
What if something happens?
If a storm rises or we get lost?

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.406
I want to go to the home
we were promised!

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:23.326
We know where we came from
and want to go where we are going!

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:26.621
Calm down!
Be quiet for one second!

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:42.989
Malcolm?

01:10:44.032 --> 01:10:46.326
Tell your friend...

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.833
...we're going home.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.882
If we saw the Beginning of All Time,

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:06.012
we would no longer have a mystery
to ponder over.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.724
And we would no longer have
anything to seek.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:13.603
I don't want to know everything
after all.

01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:18.900
And children...
for us to take you home

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.528
was surely
the purpose of our journey.

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:26.366
We are all family now, and it's time
for us to go to our home!

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.427
You have made your choice!

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.738
Rolli and juniper!

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.962
Rolli brought a whole team with him!

01:13:04.172 --> 01:13:06.758
And if I may ask...

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.635
Who might you be?

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:11.012
What Could I Be?

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:14.766
Yes... See, I have no clue.

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:19.687
Ah! You have very pretty names.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:22.649
And tomorrow you get to go to school!

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:24.651
School?

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:30.657
I'm not even going to ask you

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:33.159
what you were doing
or where you were,

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:37.455
because I wouldn't believe
a word of it, anyway.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:43.336
Singing Teacher was worried for you.
- Me? I wasn't...

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.840
Well...

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.717
Perhaps a little.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:53.430
The main thing is you made it back
from your adventure...

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.516
...in one piece.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:59.978
We always make it.

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:05.066
Yes, Rolli. So you do.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.948
So, good morning to you all.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:15.326
Good morning!

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:20.206
Whenever we get new pupils,
we start with Rolli Village history.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.667
Sounds boring.

01:14:23.168 --> 01:14:25.295
That's what everyone thinks at first

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:30.300
but I can assure the history
of this village is far from boring.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:35.305
A long time ago, no one but
rolli folk lived in this village.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:38.391
Then later, Rolli arrived.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.103
He fell from the sky
in a tiny bundle.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.314
And then we...

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:48.693
...rode the Last Dinosaur back home.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:52.363
Over the Floating Rocks
and the Eternal Forest.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.284
Over the Eternal Desert
and the Eternal Mountains!

01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:58.119
A wonderful adventure!

01:14:58.203 --> 01:15:04.876
And such a beautiful story.
- Exactly! It's just a story.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:09.047
It's fun, for sure,
but don't imagine it is true.

01:15:09.214 --> 01:15:13.968
Malcolm the Maggot just scared Rolli
once again!

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:33.279
Bye bye!

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.085
Bye!

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.100
ROLLI AND THE SECRET OF ALL TIME
