00:00.067 --> 00:01.446
Previously on "Major Crimes"...

00:01.447 --> 00:02.846
Yesterday, three teenagers went missing

00:02.848 --> 00:04.381
during a Catholic school field trip.

00:04.383 --> 00:06.050
The boy on the far right,
his name's Lucas Garza,

00:06.052 --> 00:08.420
and he's been a TypeA diabetic
since he was 7.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.885
Teacher found Lucas Garza's
backpack on the bus.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.410
Are those insulin kits?

00:12.412 --> 00:13.678
Middle boy, Ryan Rojas,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.146
two months ago, his stepfather died,

00:15.148 --> 00:17.381
putting him and his mother
in financial trouble.

00:17.383 --> 00:20.028
Your husband fell off your
balcony after beating your son.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.986
Father Jonas tried to stop me

00:21.988 --> 00:24.622
from looking into the locker
of Ryan Rojas.

00:24.624 --> 00:25.883
Miguel Diaz is a Dreamer.

00:25.885 --> 00:27.692
He would never bring unwanted
attention on to his family,

00:27.694 --> 00:28.749
who are undocumented.

00:28.751 --> 00:29.821
Why don't you want us to look

00:29.823 --> 00:30.847
under the floor of your closet?

00:30.849 --> 00:32.341
It's exactly a million dollars,

00:32.343 --> 00:33.858
and every penny of it is legally ours.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.833
Detective Camila Paige
has become exceptional

00:35.835 --> 00:37.301
- at finding teenagers.
- I'm Detective Paige.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.003
Very happy that you
requested me, Commander,

00:39.005 --> 00:40.404
and hopeful I can contribute.

00:40.406 --> 00:41.302
I'll get these wires up and running.

00:41.304 --> 00:42.627
If someone makes a ransom demand

00:42.629 --> 00:43.893
and the boys call in, we need to know.

00:43.895 --> 00:46.068
Mateo received a very angry phone call

00:46.069 --> 00:47.247
from a Marvin Garret.

00:47.249 --> 00:50.304
Your neighbor's son is missing
with two of his friends.

00:50.306 --> 00:52.974
You call it a crisis.
I call it a good start.

00:52.976 --> 00:54.815
Here's our diabetic.

00:54.817 --> 00:57.412
Now, where are the other two boys?

01:03.787 --> 01:05.853
Three teenage boys go missing

01:05.855 --> 01:08.489
from a school field trip,
then one of them...

01:08.491 --> 01:10.792
just one... winds up back
at school, dead.

01:10.794 --> 01:15.605
In an area searched
by me, patrol, and dogs,

01:15.607 --> 01:19.133
and I can assure you,
Lucas was not here yesterday.

01:19.135 --> 01:20.468
He wasn't dead yesterday either.

01:20.470 --> 01:21.903
Based on lividity and rigor,

01:21.905 --> 01:23.871
he couldn't have passed away
before 1:00 this morning.

01:23.873 --> 01:27.742
Dirt and brick underneath
the sleeping bag... dry.

01:27.744 --> 01:30.845
No dew, so he was probably
dumped here before 3:00.

01:38.788 --> 01:41.979
Um... I'm sorry.

01:42.004 --> 01:43.005
Excuse me.

01:43.006 --> 01:44.400
I was just... was hoping

01:44.402 --> 01:46.848
for some better news for these families.

01:46.849 --> 01:50.532
Um... so, we don't know who killed Lucas

01:50.533 --> 01:52.533
or where the murder occurred.

01:52.535 --> 01:54.268
I'm not sure it is a murder.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.370
That sweet smell coming from the body

01:56.372 --> 01:58.165
indicates ketoacidosis.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.740
What... what does that mean?

01:59.742 --> 02:01.642
Lucas didn't take his insulin,

02:01.644 --> 02:04.044
so acid built up in his blood
until it killed him.

02:04.046 --> 02:07.014
It leaves a fruity odor on your breath.

02:07.016 --> 02:09.049
With no other signs of trauma,
we have to assume

02:09.050 --> 02:11.084
he died from complications
related to diabetes.

02:11.086 --> 02:13.353
Diabetes didn't dump him
in this flower bed.

02:13.355 --> 02:14.781
Commander Raydor!

02:16.291 --> 02:17.990
I'd like to bless Lucas, please.

02:20.328 --> 02:22.262
You may pray over him, Father,

02:22.264 --> 02:24.764
but do not anoint or touch him.

02:32.974 --> 02:35.175
So, why leave the body so exposed?

02:35.177 --> 02:36.409
It's possible...

02:36.411 --> 02:37.877
Maybe Lucas had a seizure or passed out

02:37.879 --> 02:39.479
and the other boys freaked,

02:39.481 --> 02:41.233
were afraid to take him to the hospital,

02:41.235 --> 02:42.573
and after Lucas died, they brought him

02:42.575 --> 02:44.731
back to the church
so he'd be easy to find.

02:46.488 --> 02:48.922
Thank you for your insights,
Detective Paige.

02:48.924 --> 02:50.990
Both Ryan and Miguel knew very well

02:50.992 --> 02:53.660
that Lucas was a diabetic,
so why leave him...

02:53.662 --> 02:56.029
Do they know the symptoms
of diabetic shock?

02:56.031 --> 02:58.398
Either our missing boys are responsible

02:58.400 --> 03:00.166
for what happened here or...

03:00.168 --> 03:01.832
Or they're dead, too.

03:03.171 --> 03:05.028
I can't think of them as dead.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.173
Suspects, yes, but not dead.

03:07.175 --> 03:11.644
And, for official purposes,
Lucas is not dead yet either.

03:11.646 --> 03:15.949
No notifications until we find
out what happened.

03:15.951 --> 03:18.351
Not a word about this
off any of the wires

03:18.353 --> 03:20.086
we have in all the families's devices,

03:20.088 --> 03:22.789
but I did manage to get us
first up at the morgue.

03:24.793 --> 03:27.560
Any fibers or soil on his clothes

03:27.562 --> 03:30.163
might tell us where he's been.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.070
Mike, grab some guys

03:37.072 --> 03:39.380
and search the eastern edge
of the property

03:39.382 --> 03:41.028
moving up to the schoolyard.

03:41.030 --> 03:42.342
- Copy that.
- Thanks.

03:42.344 --> 03:44.921
Buzz, get some patrol officers
and meet me

03:44.923 --> 03:47.558
right upstairs here at that door
to the sanctuary.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.949
- Sir.
- Sykes, I want the dogs.

03:49.951 --> 03:52.719
Maybe they can, pick something up.

03:52.721 --> 03:54.320
I can smell the ketoacidosis

03:54.322 --> 03:55.262
Kendall mentioned,

03:55.264 --> 03:57.924
but there's a sweet odor
on his clothes, too.

03:57.926 --> 04:01.433
The lab will have to do
a tox screen on them also.

04:03.001 --> 04:05.534
Lieutenant! You can't go
in there looking for...

04:05.559 --> 04:06.825
This is a house of God!

04:07.068 --> 04:09.469
Christ would never keep me out. Will you?

04:09.471 --> 04:11.904
This is called a sanctuary for a reason.

04:11.906 --> 04:16.541
Oof. I'm gonna have to check
each and every injection site

04:16.543 --> 04:19.345
to make sure only insulin was used.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.749
Perhaps you can get the
archdiocese's legal department

04:22.751 --> 04:24.884
on the phone and they can explain

04:24.886 --> 04:26.853
exigent circumstances to you.

04:26.855 --> 04:29.088
Or I can just have this door broken down

04:29.090 --> 04:31.591
and ask for forgiveness
once I get inside.

04:31.593 --> 04:32.859
That won't be necessary!

04:32.861 --> 04:34.427
Stan. This is sacrilege.

04:34.429 --> 04:38.064
Sacrilege is a child found dead
outside our church.

04:38.066 --> 04:41.334
Besides, we have nothing to hide.

04:41.336 --> 04:42.602
Let's go.

04:45.006 --> 04:47.140
I don't see anything out of the way

04:47.142 --> 04:49.149
except a little mild
inflammation of the throat.

04:49.151 --> 04:51.377
Is that inconsistent with natural causes?

04:51.379 --> 04:53.046
Ketoacidosis normally ends in a coma,

04:53.048 --> 04:55.448
but he could've had seizures
and vomiting first.

04:55.450 --> 04:57.012
This kind of inflammation often appears

04:57.014 --> 04:58.651
as result of acid reflux.

04:58.653 --> 05:00.386
Lieutenant, Ryan and Miguel

05:00.388 --> 05:01.788
are not involved with this.

05:01.790 --> 05:04.090
You have an awful lot of faith
in these boys, Father.

05:04.092 --> 05:06.192
Because they wouldn't
dump Lucas somewhere

05:06.194 --> 05:08.094
in a sleeping bag. They're friends.

05:08.096 --> 05:10.130
They love each other. Loved.

05:10.132 --> 05:11.768
They loved each other.

05:12.261 --> 05:13.657
No obvious signs of sexual assault,

05:13.659 --> 05:15.192
although it's hard to say for sure.

05:15.194 --> 05:16.424
What about drugs?

05:16.426 --> 05:18.721
We'll run a tox screen, but
since you need answers fast,

05:18.723 --> 05:20.345
I can check his stomach contents.

05:25.504 --> 05:27.537
Since you're so close to these kids,

05:27.539 --> 05:30.073
let's have you
and Father Stan come downtown.

05:30.075 --> 05:32.069
Eventually we'll have
to notify the Garzas

05:32.070 --> 05:34.237
and the other parents that Lucas is dead.

05:34.239 --> 05:36.806
Your presence might be
a comfort to the family.

05:37.195 --> 05:40.010
What do you intend to tell them?

05:40.012 --> 05:41.825
Depends on what we find.

05:42.314 --> 05:47.150
Nothing but bile,
which is what you'd expect.

05:47.152 --> 05:50.620
A boy who'd had diabetes
for so long would know

05:50.622 --> 05:54.324
that his best shot at staying
alive was eating.

05:54.326 --> 05:56.420
- But he didn't eat.
- Or he wasn't allowed to.

05:56.422 --> 06:00.597
Hold on..

06:00.599 --> 06:02.474
Yes, Chief?

06:02.476 --> 06:04.868
Yeah, we're still with the body.

06:04.870 --> 06:07.637
Why? On my way.

06:07.639 --> 06:09.706
The FBI is here.

06:09.708 --> 06:12.127
Lieutenant, we didn't
locate anything outside.

06:12.129 --> 06:14.978
If the dogs are done inside here,

06:14.980 --> 06:18.048
I can give them a run
outside on the grounds.

06:18.050 --> 06:20.684
- Hey, guys, with me.
- Nothing in the school either.

06:20.686 --> 06:22.178
And now the press has arrived.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.676
God.

06:25.657 --> 06:27.412
Thanks for nothing.

06:28.727 --> 06:29.929
The fact that the police

06:29.931 --> 06:31.389
are searching here a second time

06:31.391 --> 06:33.997
raises questions about
the Church's involvement

06:33.999 --> 06:36.433
in the disappearance
of the St. Joseph's Three.

06:36.435 --> 06:38.009
Other than mentioning Marvin Garret

06:38.011 --> 06:40.724
as a person of interest,
the L.A.P.D. offered no signs

06:40.726 --> 06:43.933
of progress in the disappearance
of the St. Joseph's Three...

06:43.934 --> 06:46.434
Lucas Garza, Ryan Rojas,
and Miguel Diaz...

06:46.436 --> 06:48.369
though, as we know from long experience,

06:48.371 --> 06:52.087
it's difficult to get community
assistance in gangrelated...

06:52.089 --> 06:53.975
seem to be splitting their attention

06:53.977 --> 06:56.856
between the next door neighbor
of a family of illegals

06:56.857 --> 07:00.392
and St. Joseph of Nazareth's,
a church famous for schooling

07:00.394 --> 07:04.057
and supporting socalled
"undocumented immigrants."

07:04.059 --> 07:07.391
By refusing to classify the
kidnapping of three Latino boys

07:07.393 --> 07:10.777
as a hate crime, the L.A.P.D.
has sent a very clear messa...

07:11.748 --> 07:14.533
It's all true, and it's all wrong.

07:14.627 --> 07:16.127
Well, as the Commander has said,

07:16.129 --> 07:17.741
as long as they keep showing
the boys' pictures...

07:17.743 --> 07:20.865
And clearly, the news captured
the attention of the FBI.

07:20.867 --> 07:23.184
No, we're here because
of the court order.

07:23.186 --> 07:25.870
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz filed to get
their million dollars back.

07:25.872 --> 07:28.039
Of course we would've preferred to hear

07:28.041 --> 07:29.507
about the kidnapping from you guys,

07:29.509 --> 07:31.576
as that's the procedure
in abductions like this.

07:31.578 --> 07:34.645
I'm sorry, Special Agent Vega,
Special Agent Fey.

07:34.647 --> 07:36.781
Do you guys know something we don't?

07:36.783 --> 07:38.382
Because we have no evidence
of kidnapping.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.985
The Diaz were obviously
putting together a ransom.

07:40.987 --> 07:42.834
Why not check out the Garzas, then?

07:42.836 --> 07:44.200
They're multimillionaires.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.481
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz could
have cartel connections

07:46.483 --> 07:47.915
that make them a target.

07:47.917 --> 07:51.062
Kidnappings aren't exactly
uncommon in that community.

07:51.064 --> 07:53.289
You're assuming, because
they're of Mexican descent,

07:53.291 --> 07:54.899
they're mixed up in cartels?

07:54.901 --> 07:56.300
I'm of Mexican descent.

07:56.302 --> 07:58.035
So, no, I don't assume cartel connections

07:58.037 --> 08:00.204
because of Señor and
Señora Diaz's heritage.

08:00.206 --> 08:02.239
I assume it because
they're here illegally.

08:02.241 --> 08:03.874
And when you come
to this country the wrong way,

08:03.876 --> 08:05.109
you can get caught up
with the wrong people.

08:05.111 --> 08:07.378
Isn't it more likely that the three boys

08:07.380 --> 08:09.680
- just went off together...
- Okay, look.

08:09.682 --> 08:11.382
I know L.A. is a sanctuary city,

08:11.384 --> 08:13.498
and you want to give these
people a pass...

08:13.500 --> 08:15.820
A pass? The Diaz's son is missing,

08:15.822 --> 08:18.155
one of the boys he disappeared
with is dead.

08:18.157 --> 08:19.890
What sort of a pass is that?

08:19.892 --> 08:21.759
You could use the threat of deportation

08:21.761 --> 08:23.160
to make them more cooperative.

08:23.162 --> 08:25.129
And break the trust the L.A.P.D. has

08:25.131 --> 08:26.964
with the undocumented community?

08:26.966 --> 08:29.967
Do you want them to stop
stepping forward as witnesses,

08:29.969 --> 08:32.269
to quit reporting rapes,
missing children,

08:32.270 --> 08:34.605
and murders out of fear
of being deported?

08:34.607 --> 08:37.073
And don't start this sanctuary
city bullshit with me.

08:37.076 --> 08:39.342
The L.A.P.D. may not have
a budget or an obligation

08:39.345 --> 08:40.878
to enforce U.S. immigration laws,

08:40.880 --> 08:42.113
but we never keep you guys from doing it.

08:42.115 --> 08:43.648
You want to head downstairs, Vega?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.438
Make some random stops, ask some
people for their papers?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.711
The streets are all yours.

08:46.713 --> 08:48.052
Or you can hang here for a moment

08:48.054 --> 08:49.412
and get caught up with this case.

08:49.413 --> 08:50.713
Your choice.

08:51.973 --> 08:53.215
We're listening.

08:54.220 --> 08:55.945
Okay, the boys left the field trip

08:55.947 --> 08:57.046
out of their own volition

08:57.048 --> 09:00.594
and it appears
were not coerced into a car.

09:00.596 --> 09:04.059
Yes. We found Lucas Garza's body
at a Catholic church.

09:04.084 --> 09:06.484
You know who hangs out
at Catholic churches?

09:06.486 --> 09:07.752
Priests.

09:07.754 --> 09:10.755
These boys would've let
Father Jonas drive them away

09:10.757 --> 09:12.123
without a second thought.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.558
And then the priest murdered Lucas Garza?

09:13.560 --> 09:15.393
It's not a murder yet.

09:15.395 --> 09:19.597
He died from complications
related to diabetes.

09:19.599 --> 09:21.066
Okay, how about this?

09:21.068 --> 09:23.268
We make the Diaz's million
dollars available to you,

09:23.270 --> 09:25.904
and if it turns out it was
for a ransom, the case is yours.

09:25.906 --> 09:28.218
And you keep the money, no problem.

09:29.886 --> 09:30.950
Okay.

09:30.952 --> 09:33.845
We also need to tell the Diazes
that Lucas is dead.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.032
They know how high the stakes are,

09:35.034 --> 09:36.963
they're much more likely
to admit the ransom demand.

09:36.965 --> 09:40.552
We can't notify the Diazes
about the death of Lucas Garza

09:40.554 --> 09:42.987
before telling the Garzas themselves.

09:42.989 --> 09:45.090
It's unethical. I won't do it.

09:45.092 --> 09:47.292
I'd hate to have to tell
my friends at ICE

09:47.294 --> 09:49.594
about the Diaz's illegal entry
into the U.S.

09:49.596 --> 09:51.296
You tell anybody you want, Vega.

09:51.298 --> 09:54.068
Right now, these missing boys
are either suspects

09:54.070 --> 09:55.297
or material witnesses,

09:55.299 --> 09:59.704
and the Diaz family is not going
anywhere until we sort that out.

09:59.706 --> 10:02.022
However, notifying
the Garzas about Lucas' death,

10:02.024 --> 10:04.709
that, Commander... that is
something we have to do.

10:04.711 --> 10:07.779
Well, then we have to inform
the other families as well.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.115
We should join your discussion
with the Diaz family.

10:10.117 --> 10:12.417
Certainly. Lieutenant Flynn will show.

10:12.419 --> 10:15.954
Special Agents Fey and Vega
to our conference room.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:24.030 --> 10:25.964
Are you sure you want
the FBI in on this, boss,

10:25.966 --> 10:27.265
and with the families?

10:27.267 --> 10:28.833
One of the parents could be involved.

10:28.835 --> 10:30.802
But in the absence of compelling
evidence to that effect...

10:30.804 --> 10:32.337
All right, Chief, but be aware

10:32.339 --> 10:34.773
I'm not giving up
my jurisdictional authority

10:34.775 --> 10:36.274
over this case without cause.

10:36.276 --> 10:38.510
Better to have the FBI standing
inside the tent

10:38.512 --> 10:41.045
and pissing out than
outside the tent, pissing in.

10:41.047 --> 10:44.048
But either way, I'm not cleaning it up.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.221
Chief.

10:50.223 --> 10:53.758
I never say this to anyone
except my wife, but here goes.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.561
I was wrong, you were right.

10:56.563 --> 10:57.796
About?

10:57.798 --> 10:59.798
This case is beginning to feel like

10:59.800 --> 11:03.501
a seriously major crime.

11:32.175 --> 11:33.591
Sara?

11:41.344 --> 11:43.460
You know Father Stan, of course.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.694
Doctor, this is Lieutenant Provenza.

11:45.696 --> 11:49.298
Father Stan? What are you doing here?

11:49.300 --> 11:51.166
Thought I might be able to help,

11:51.168 --> 11:54.113
or at least provide some support.

11:54.539 --> 11:58.073
SSupport? What's going on?

11:59.310 --> 12:02.778
Mr. and Mrs. Diaz,
has anyone contacted you...

12:02.780 --> 12:05.848
by phone, email, text... about your son?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.950
Is this more about a ransom?

12:07.952 --> 12:09.852
Wwe've been all over this.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.488
That money is operating cash
for our business.

12:12.490 --> 12:13.622
We've told you that.

12:13.624 --> 12:15.124
And you've told us nothing.

12:15.126 --> 12:17.587
You must know something about my son.

12:17.589 --> 12:20.563
You must know something by now.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.707
We do have some bad news

12:22.709 --> 12:24.435
we need to share with you.

12:25.236 --> 12:28.147
Thankfully, it's not
about your son, but...

12:28.806 --> 12:31.340
We found Lucas's body.

12:37.214 --> 12:43.218
No... no... no...

12:43.220 --> 12:46.088
No... no...

12:46.090 --> 12:48.791
Wwhere? Where did you find him? When?

12:48.793 --> 12:51.293
This morning, outside of St. Joseph's.

12:51.295 --> 12:53.862
He was wrapped up in a sleeping bag

12:53.864 --> 12:56.676
and left on top of a flower bed.

12:57.969 --> 13:02.304
No, no, yyou looked there.

13:02.306 --> 13:04.940
YYou... you said
you looked at the church.

13:04.942 --> 13:07.476
You told us that!
You... They told us that!

13:07.478 --> 13:08.777
We believe his body

13:08.779 --> 13:11.614
was deliberately placed there overnight.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.716
How can... how can you be sure?

13:13.718 --> 13:15.445
I can't believe this. I can't...

13:17.322 --> 13:19.355
HHow did he die?

13:19.357 --> 13:21.690
He missed his insulin injections.

13:21.692 --> 13:23.626
Ketoacidosis took over.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.624
Natural causes.

13:28.866 --> 13:30.543
We're very sorry.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.103
So Ryan didn't do it?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.401
Thank God.

13:35.403 --> 13:37.175
Thank God.

13:39.177 --> 13:41.543
Wait, what's going on in there?

13:41.545 --> 13:43.746
What have they told her?

13:43.748 --> 13:45.850
What does she know that we don't know?!

13:47.351 --> 13:49.952
One of the reasons we need you
to take the ransom questions

13:49.954 --> 13:55.824
more seriously is that...
Lucas Garza is dead.

13:55.826 --> 13:57.422
We know that these

13:57.424 --> 14:00.329
are incredibly tough circumstances,

14:00.331 --> 14:03.187
but we still have
two other boys missing...

14:03.189 --> 14:05.501
Those boys?!

14:05.503 --> 14:08.470
Those boys are the reason
that my son is gone!

14:08.472 --> 14:11.172
Sara, please, they would never
do anything to harm...

14:11.174 --> 14:12.886
Don't touch me!

14:12.888 --> 14:14.843
You have never been here for this family!

14:14.845 --> 14:16.078
Sara, Mateo.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.213
It might be best to pray for the faith,

14:18.215 --> 14:19.948
the strength to overcome...

14:19.950 --> 14:24.987
We trusted your church with
my son, and look what happened!

14:26.624 --> 14:28.457
You let those two other boys

14:28.459 --> 14:31.083
talk Lucas into leaving with them!

14:32.630 --> 14:34.524
Ms. Garza!

14:35.599 --> 14:37.443
Can I see Lucas?

14:38.736 --> 14:40.863
His body?

14:42.139 --> 14:45.274
I'd like to see my son, please.

14:46.811 --> 14:49.378
What did they do?!

14:49.380 --> 14:52.881
What did Ryan do to my boy?!
What did he do?!

14:52.883 --> 14:55.984
Your son is a killer! You're a killer!

14:55.986 --> 14:58.387
You married a killer,
and look what happened!

14:58.389 --> 15:00.389
My boy is dead,

15:00.391 --> 15:03.459
and you're just standing around
doing nothing!

15:03.461 --> 15:05.527
How could you not be doing something!

15:08.232 --> 15:10.332
- Amy.
- They killed him!

15:10.334 --> 15:12.935
They killed him! They killed him!

15:12.937 --> 15:15.104
- You killed my boy!
- Whwhat?

15:15.106 --> 15:17.539
They killed him!
Ryan and Miguel killed my son!

15:17.541 --> 15:21.110
They killed my boy! They killed my boy!

15:21.112 --> 15:23.479
They killed my son.

15:23.481 --> 15:28.517
They killed my baby.

15:38.162 --> 15:39.394
There's no absolute proof

15:39.396 --> 15:41.130
about who's behind these deaths,

15:41.132 --> 15:43.799
but somehow or other, they all
have Phillip Stroh in common,

15:43.801 --> 15:47.035
and you are still the most
important witness against him.

15:47.037 --> 15:48.537
What about Brenda?

15:48.539 --> 15:51.607
Former Chief Johnson
is an expolice officer

15:51.609 --> 15:52.642
whose interest in Stroh

15:52.644 --> 15:55.277
strayed into extrajudicial territory.

15:55.279 --> 15:59.414
Well, she shot him, several times.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.617
Look, when we first met,
I didn't like you,

16:01.619 --> 16:03.552
not only because you were difficult,

16:03.554 --> 16:05.954
but because I mostly
dislike all teenagers.

16:05.956 --> 16:07.256
Now, though...

16:07.258 --> 16:10.225
now, you're an adult,
and you've grown on me.

16:10.227 --> 16:12.546
And in addition
to being the best assistant

16:12.548 --> 16:14.763
I have ever had, you are also

16:14.765 --> 16:17.833
the material witness
in an unresolved murder trial,

16:17.835 --> 16:20.769
and while Phillip Stroh lives,
the State must protect you.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.405
But I'd rather be able
to help defend myself,

16:23.407 --> 16:25.407
and I want access to some those...

16:25.409 --> 16:28.076
I am confident that we can take
care of you, Rusty.

16:28.078 --> 16:30.345
We're professionals.
We do this all the time.

16:31.432 --> 16:34.516
The person responsible
for Lucas Garza's death

16:34.518 --> 16:35.851
had to know him.

16:35.853 --> 16:38.887
Lucas and the other kids...
three 15yearold boys...

16:38.889 --> 16:42.457
now, you couldn't force them
into a vehicle all at once

16:42.459 --> 16:44.626
without some kind of a struggle.

16:44.628 --> 16:48.163
Father Jonas just can't stop
telling us enough

16:48.165 --> 16:50.532
how close he was to these boys.

16:50.534 --> 16:54.203
I think he may have been very
close to Ryan's mother as well.

16:54.205 --> 16:56.605
And Lucas's body was at the church.

16:56.607 --> 16:58.874
If that makes Father Jonas a suspect,

16:58.876 --> 17:02.177
so is every teacher, student,
and parishioner at St. Joseph's.

17:02.179 --> 17:03.378
Yeah, but they weren't there

17:03.380 --> 17:04.746
obstructing justice this morning.

17:04.748 --> 17:06.848
Father Jonas was, and
that's enough to arrest him.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.483
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- I agree with Andrea.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.717
I've dealt with the Church
in an official capacity before,

17:11.719 --> 17:15.123
and they can go from righteous
to hostile very quickly.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.227
That's why I'm thankful we have
someone here who is capable

17:18.229 --> 17:20.395
of dealing with the priests
of St. Joseph's

17:20.396 --> 17:22.297
in an extremely personal way.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.301
I suppose you're beginning
to believe that these boys

17:27.304 --> 17:29.304
were responsible for
their own disappearance.

17:29.306 --> 17:31.306
Do you have any idea
where they were going?

17:31.308 --> 17:34.576
No, but they did walk away
from the museum together,

17:34.578 --> 17:37.827
unforced, and they drove off
with someone they knew.

17:37.829 --> 17:39.018
Is that certain?

17:39.020 --> 17:41.083
If they had a friend
or a relative pick them up,

17:41.085 --> 17:42.135
Father Jonas would be able to...

17:42.137 --> 17:44.177
Father Jonas won't help you
paint these boys

17:44.179 --> 17:45.162
into troubled teens.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.689
Lucas's father struggles with addiction,

17:47.691 --> 17:49.157
Ryan was physically abused,

17:49.159 --> 17:51.526
and Miguel lives in fear of deportation.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.062
That sounds like trouble to me, Father.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.379
Well, you can't expect Jonas
to tell you anything

17:58.381 --> 18:01.235
he heard from Ryan or Miguel
in confession

18:01.237 --> 18:02.687
or do anything that would break

18:02.689 --> 18:04.406
his sacred relationship with them.

18:04.408 --> 18:06.737
His sacred relationship with these boys

18:06.739 --> 18:08.577
will be over if they die.

18:08.579 --> 18:12.114
How many more 15yearolds
are you prepared to find

18:12.116 --> 18:14.549
in the flower beds of St. Joseph's?

18:14.551 --> 18:17.552
But how do you expect us
to stop that from happening?

18:17.554 --> 18:21.227
I have put so much faith
in the Catholic Church.

18:21.229 --> 18:25.160
I would ask if the Church
put just a little faith in me.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.097
Was there any conflict
between the three boys,

18:29.099 --> 18:30.632
as far as you know?

18:30.634 --> 18:31.900
I don't think so.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.403
No bullying, no fighting over a girl?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.972
We know that Kelly Garret
liked Lucas a lot,

18:36.974 --> 18:38.340
and Miguel liked her.

18:38.342 --> 18:40.709
Ryan spent a lot of time
with her, too, didn't he?

18:40.711 --> 18:43.345
Ryan is not interested in Kelly Garret,

18:43.347 --> 18:44.746
that I promise you.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.214
As for Miguel and Lucas,

18:46.216 --> 18:47.816
there was tension at first,
but it went away.

18:47.818 --> 18:51.887
Now, yyou were closer to Ryan
than the other two boys.

18:51.889 --> 18:53.113
Is that right?

18:53.115 --> 18:55.955
I have a very specific
relationship with each of them,

18:55.957 --> 19:00.295
but my bond with Ryan is... yes,
it's more intense.

19:00.297 --> 19:02.998
How intense? I don't like that word.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.800
"Intense." <i>...neglected.</i>

19:04.802 --> 19:08.437
Neglected kids make better
targets for exploitation.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.705
Well, he definitely knows

19:09.707 --> 19:11.573
all the intimate details of Ryan's life.

19:11.575 --> 19:14.276
<i>So, you said Ryan's
biological father, Ian,</i>

19:14.278 --> 19:15.577
<i>was a real piece of work.</i>

19:15.579 --> 19:17.177
<i>- So you met him?</i>
- I have.

19:17.179 --> 19:19.114
Yeah, he came to the school
about two weeks ago,

19:19.116 --> 19:21.984
and when I wouldn't release Ryan
to him, he threatened me.

19:21.986 --> 19:23.352
He even pushed me a little.

19:23.354 --> 19:25.387
What did you do?
Turn the other cheek?

19:25.954 --> 19:27.172
I asked for security,

19:27.174 --> 19:29.024
but I let him speak to Ryan for a moment

19:29.026 --> 19:32.494
because of what the boy and
his mother are going through.

19:32.496 --> 19:34.730
God seems to be challenging Ryan.

19:34.732 --> 19:37.232
First his biological father rejects him,

19:37.234 --> 19:38.638
then his cartelaffiliated stepdad

19:38.640 --> 19:42.304
sort of falls off a balcony,
and now he's disappeared.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.806
Sometimes challenges like
these are given to us

19:44.808 --> 19:47.042
so that we might seek harder for Christ.

19:47.044 --> 19:49.244
The physical abuse that Ryan
suffered from his stepfather...

19:49.246 --> 19:50.531
Okay, let's take it back a second.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.734
If you knew that Ryan was
getting knocked around,

19:52.736 --> 19:54.141
why didn't you report it?

19:54.143 --> 19:56.518
Apart from the Church's little
habit of covering up abuse...

19:56.520 --> 19:57.986
<i>You're getting close to
privileged information,</i>

19:57.988 --> 19:59.888
but I can tell you this...

19:59.890 --> 20:01.563
Ryan came to school a couple of days

20:01.565 --> 20:02.707
with bruises on his face,

20:02.709 --> 20:04.103
which he tried to explain away.

20:04.105 --> 20:05.129
I didn't believe him,

20:05.131 --> 20:07.396
and at the proper moment,
we discussed it.

20:07.398 --> 20:09.698
Okay, so, if it was clear to you

20:09.700 --> 20:12.401
that Ryan had been knocked around,

20:12.403 --> 20:15.237
could it have been obvious to others?

20:15.239 --> 20:16.605
Possibly.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.874
Could some of them have been motivated

20:18.876 --> 20:20.475
to act on that knowledge?

20:20.477 --> 20:21.576
I'm not sure what you mean.

20:21.578 --> 20:22.911
Could Lucas or Miguel have noticed

20:22.913 --> 20:24.546
that his gangster stepfather
was beating him

20:24.548 --> 20:26.114
and taken matters into their own hands?

20:26.116 --> 20:28.350
Are you suggesting these boys
pushed Ryan's stepdad

20:28.352 --> 20:29.551
off that balcony together?

20:29.553 --> 20:30.919
I've stood on Ms. Rojas' balcony.

20:30.921 --> 20:33.288
- No one just fell over it.
- Hector could've jumped!

20:33.290 --> 20:36.892
Or a Mexican cartel employee
was pushed to his death.

20:36.894 --> 20:39.394
And then the cartel decided to push back,

20:39.396 --> 20:40.695
and the boys made a run for it.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.364
<i>Or maybe Lucas felt guilty</i>

20:42.366 --> 20:43.765
<i>about helping murder his friend's stepdad</i>

20:43.767 --> 20:45.667
<i>and then wanted to go to the police,</i>

20:45.669 --> 20:48.503
and maybe Ryan and Miguel felt
like Lucas was losing his nerve.

20:48.505 --> 20:50.605
You just won't stop, will you,

20:50.607 --> 20:53.375
until you turn these boys into monsters!

20:53.377 --> 20:54.554
<i>Excuse me.</i>

20:54.556 --> 20:56.678
<i>I have to help some
traumatized students at school</i>

20:56.680 --> 20:58.513
deal with the death
of someone they loved.

20:58.515 --> 21:00.182
And I'm sad to say

21:00.184 --> 21:02.851
<i>that right now,
our prayers are doing more</i>

21:02.853 --> 21:05.420
<i>to find Ryan and Miguel than you people.</i>

21:05.422 --> 21:09.524
This is exactly the ending
I wanted to avoid,

21:09.526 --> 21:14.629
and we still have no idea
where those boys were going.

21:17.434 --> 21:22.838
Well... next time,
we use a gentler touch.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.474
At least we have a pretty good
idea he's hiding something.

21:25.476 --> 21:29.177
Well, he's a priest.
Of course he's hiding something.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.583
Hey, off the subject,

21:34.585 --> 21:36.384
but why is everyone putting money

21:36.386 --> 21:38.153
in that jar on the lieutenant's desk?

21:38.155 --> 21:41.089
For the use of his printer.
We pay him 5 cents a page.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.491
What are you talking about?

21:42.493 --> 21:43.959
Look, you just have to do it.

21:43.961 --> 21:46.261
Also, don't sit at the lieutenant's desk.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.596
Ever.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.030
Anything else I need to know?

21:49.032 --> 21:51.433
It's great that you understand

21:51.435 --> 21:53.368
the way Commander Raydor thinks,

21:53.370 --> 21:55.904
but it might better for, well, everyone,

21:55.906 --> 21:57.305
if you let her talk first.

21:57.307 --> 21:59.508
I mean, since she's in charge.

22:05.682 --> 22:09.484
Father Jonas may be waiting
for you by the elevator.

22:09.486 --> 22:10.687
- He was upset.
- Over?

22:10.689 --> 22:13.922
Some alternative theories
about the disappearance

22:13.924 --> 22:15.907
we were simply trying to eliminate.

22:15.909 --> 22:17.987
If you could convince him to come back.

22:17.989 --> 22:21.663
He's very knowledgeable about these boys.

22:24.001 --> 22:26.568
You understand, Sharon,
my primary mission

22:26.570 --> 22:27.869
is to serve the Church?

22:27.871 --> 22:31.406
And mine is to find Ryan
and Miguel alive.

22:32.209 --> 22:35.277
Are you suggesting our missions conflict?

22:51.656 --> 22:52.734
Congrats.

22:52.736 --> 22:56.184
You've actually made me suspect
Father Jonas a little.

22:56.317 --> 22:58.083
And the problem with that is?

22:58.085 --> 23:00.853
The problem is that interview
also made me suspect

23:00.855 --> 23:03.255
Ryan's biological father and convinced me

23:03.257 --> 23:04.590
that we need to follow up

23:04.592 --> 23:06.343
on the accidental death of his stepdad,

23:06.345 --> 23:08.943
because the theory that these
boys killed Lucas

23:08.945 --> 23:11.236
in a coverup is suddenly very credible.

23:11.238 --> 23:13.352
I forgot,
there's the Diaz's neighbor,

23:13.353 --> 23:15.353
who the lieutenant helpfully nominated

23:15.355 --> 23:18.089
as a person of interest
to the press and his daughter,

23:18.091 --> 23:19.591
who has a driver's license.

23:19.593 --> 23:21.993
The defense will have
a field day with those two,

23:21.995 --> 23:23.795
not to mention the addicted Dr. Garza

23:23.797 --> 23:26.798
and the undocumented couple
with their million in cash.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.166
I'll come back

23:28.168 --> 23:29.868
when you've drained
the suspect pool a little

23:29.870 --> 23:31.269
and maybe settled on a motive.

23:31.271 --> 23:33.571
Thank you, Andrea.
We'll keep you informed.

23:33.573 --> 23:35.507
Good luck finding the kids alive.

23:36.398 --> 23:38.576
I'll meet you downstairs
in a few minutes.

23:38.578 --> 23:40.044
Sure.

23:45.893 --> 23:47.127
I want a gun.

23:47.129 --> 23:48.353
What?!

23:48.355 --> 23:50.121
I don't want to depend on
someone else being there

23:50.123 --> 23:51.890
at the right time and place,
and I want my own...

23:51.892 --> 23:53.191
No, no, I get it.

23:53.193 --> 23:55.360
But, look, if you would just accept

23:55.362 --> 23:58.630
an undercover detail like
any ordinary person...

23:58.632 --> 23:59.697
I don't have to ask.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.200
I'm 21. The 2nd Amendment is on my side.

24:02.202 --> 24:04.355
Okay, look, I'm not gonna stand here

24:04.357 --> 24:07.038
and argue about
the Constitution with you.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.874
Why ask me about a gun instead of Sharon?

24:09.876 --> 24:12.343
Because I also want a permit
to carry a concealed weapon,

24:12.345 --> 24:13.785
and I know that those have to be approved

24:13.787 --> 24:16.047
by someone higher...
the Chief or Sheriff...

24:16.049 --> 24:17.582
so I'm gonna need Mom's help with that.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.784
Plus, I think it would be wrong
to bring a weapon

24:19.786 --> 24:21.619
into the house without her permission.

24:21.621 --> 24:23.488
Good, you're not completely crazy.

24:23.490 --> 24:26.302
And you want my help convincing Sharon

24:26.304 --> 24:28.655
that you should have
a concealandcarry permit.

24:28.657 --> 24:30.422
- Please.
- My God.

24:30.424 --> 24:32.463
I am willing to learn
everything I need to know

24:32.465 --> 24:34.833
about how to use a gun and keep it safe.

24:34.835 --> 24:36.067
Andy, please?

24:36.069 --> 24:38.503
I promise you will not be sorry.

24:40.421 --> 24:41.647
Okay, kid.

24:41.649 --> 24:42.874
I will talk to Sharon,

24:42.876 --> 24:45.944
and I will try to give her
your point of view.

24:46.468 --> 24:48.179
Let me get back to work.

24:50.851 --> 24:54.159
So, the FBI got a report back
on the Diaz's million dollars,

24:54.161 --> 24:56.331
and since we have information
to share, too,

24:56.333 --> 24:58.456
I'd like to propose we form
an ad hoc task force.

24:58.458 --> 25:00.625
And who would be in charge
of this task force?

25:00.627 --> 25:02.594
The L.A.P.D. has absolute jurisdiction,

25:02.596 --> 25:05.096
especially as the kidnapping
has yet to be proven.

25:05.098 --> 25:06.177
But our position...

25:06.179 --> 25:08.566
Commander Raydor leads
or we go our separate ways.

25:08.568 --> 25:09.825
The end.

25:11.104 --> 25:13.454
So, what did you learn about the money?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.541
The Diazes have an older daughter, Anna.

25:16.543 --> 25:19.110
The million dollars was
withdrawn from her bank account

25:19.112 --> 25:20.402
just last week.

25:20.404 --> 25:23.221
Anna is an American citizen...
well, married to one.

25:23.223 --> 25:24.649
We should make sure
they're living together

25:24.651 --> 25:25.583
as husband and wife.

25:25.585 --> 25:27.285
You do that, Victor.

25:27.287 --> 25:29.721
And following up, we found the
money was a transfer payment

25:29.723 --> 25:31.689
to Anna for a house sold by her parents.

25:31.691 --> 25:34.959
But there's a kicker... the Diaz
family only bought that house

25:34.961 --> 25:36.561
six months ago, also with cash,

25:36.563 --> 25:39.430
for 100 grand less than
they ended up selling it for.

25:42.066 --> 25:44.702
Ever hear of money laundering?

25:44.704 --> 25:47.338
Ever hear of house flipping?

25:47.340 --> 25:49.574
That's their business, Vega...

25:49.576 --> 25:51.843
buying homes more cheaply
than they sell them.

25:51.845 --> 25:53.778
Should we pause here to explain

25:53.780 --> 25:55.747
the rudimentary basics of capitalism?

25:55.749 --> 25:57.749
- No, it's not...
- Congratulations, Vega.

25:57.751 --> 25:59.417
You used the Diaz's money to prove

25:59.419 --> 26:00.885
that they're good at their jobs.

26:00.887 --> 26:03.521
Since the information we got
from the FBI was worthless,

26:03.523 --> 26:05.890
can we pretend this task force
thing never happened?

26:05.892 --> 26:09.327
Detective Sykes,
let's try and move forward.

26:09.329 --> 26:11.462
Let's start by going back.

26:11.464 --> 26:16.367
Two weeks ago, Ryan Rojas'
biological father, Ian Nuñez,

26:16.369 --> 26:19.837
tried to bribe him into leaving school.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.973
Maybe Mr. Nuñez did that same thing

26:21.975 --> 26:23.441
last Thursday at the museum.

26:23.443 --> 26:24.842
Which would, admittedly,

26:24.844 --> 26:27.119
almost fit with a kidnapping scenario.

26:27.121 --> 26:28.579
We tried to get Mr. Nuñez

26:28.581 --> 26:30.791
to consent to a search of his house.

26:30.793 --> 26:31.976
He denied it.

26:31.978 --> 26:33.418
Then now sounds like the perfect time

26:33.420 --> 26:34.819
to tap all the families' phones.

26:34.821 --> 26:35.920
There's a chance

26:35.922 --> 26:37.488
these parents aren't
telling us everything,

26:37.490 --> 26:39.457
and you guys can get wires up and running

26:39.459 --> 26:40.892
much faster than we can.

26:40.894 --> 26:43.828
Look, if you have something
you need us to do for you,

26:43.830 --> 26:45.163
you should do this for us.

26:45.165 --> 26:47.865
Chief? Your thoughts?

26:55.608 --> 26:56.874
Okay, then.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.703
Let's start writing
a warrant allowing us

26:59.705 --> 27:01.846
to listen to the families
on all their different devices.

27:01.848 --> 27:03.681
- Amy?
- Yes, Commander.

27:03.683 --> 27:06.551
But even though we can do
this faster than you,

27:06.553 --> 27:07.790
it still takes hours.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.022
And while we manage that part
of our brandnew task force,

27:11.024 --> 27:13.324
Detective Paige?

27:14.408 --> 27:16.594
Yes, thank you, Commander.

27:16.596 --> 27:18.629
Maybe you guys could do
a really thorough check

27:18.631 --> 27:21.059
on Marvin Garret, the Diaz's neighbor.

27:21.061 --> 27:22.600
It's important that we speak
with his daughter, Kelly,

27:22.602 --> 27:25.903
but we have no legal means
of forcing Marvin to cooperate.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.973
Hey, it's even possible
you could find something

27:28.975 --> 27:32.443
on Mr. Garret more incriminating
than house flipping.

27:32.445 --> 27:34.278
Commander, something
just popped up on our wire

27:34.280 --> 27:35.780
and I... I, I...

27:35.782 --> 27:38.850
You've already got a phone tap
up and running?

27:38.852 --> 27:40.485
Ono, no.

27:40.487 --> 27:43.821
You thought... this is not
for the St. Joseph's Three.

27:43.823 --> 27:48.393
It's from our ongoing
investigation into the...

27:48.395 --> 27:51.362
Commander, would it be okay
if I mentioned the,

27:51.364 --> 27:53.431
the Hollywood Strangler?

27:53.433 --> 27:55.566
- Okay, Buzz.
- Hollywood Strangler.

27:55.568 --> 27:58.302
Well, that's what we're
calling it internally.

27:58.304 --> 28:00.270
Fine. Where should we set up?

28:00.272 --> 28:03.574
Lieutenant Flynn
will help you settle in

28:03.576 --> 28:05.243
somewhere over there.

28:05.245 --> 28:06.844
Um, excuse us while we continue

28:06.846 --> 28:08.579
to investigate the other case.

28:08.581 --> 28:13.418
Right over here, guys.
Desk one, desk two.

28:13.420 --> 28:14.786
Be right there!

28:16.656 --> 28:19.757
You're upping the price per page?

28:19.759 --> 28:22.894
Wait, Lieutenant, did you
deliberately keep us

28:22.896 --> 28:24.429
from getting a new printer

28:24.431 --> 28:25.804
so you could do some price gouging?

28:25.806 --> 28:28.633
Shh! Now, you and the squad

28:28.635 --> 28:31.202
will pay your regular nickel a copy.

28:31.204 --> 28:36.274
This is a new federal tax.

28:36.276 --> 28:38.976
Ad hoc task force, my ass.

28:43.550 --> 28:46.717
An hour ago, Daniella Rojas
made a call to a landline

28:46.719 --> 28:49.087
- belonging to her exhusband.
- Ian Nuñez.

28:49.089 --> 28:51.989
This might make it clearer as to
why they didn't stay in touch.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.858
<i>I told you not to call me here.</i>

28:53.860 --> 28:56.127
Until you pay your child support,

28:56.129 --> 28:57.562
I'll call you wherever I want.

28:57.564 --> 28:59.030
You should've thought
about your bank account

28:59.032 --> 29:00.865
before letting your new husband
fall off a balcony.

29:00.867 --> 29:02.934
- I never touched him.
- Yeah, right.

29:02.936 --> 29:04.735
Well, good thing the police
don't know you like I do.

29:04.737 --> 29:06.204
What, what is this about anyway?

29:06.206 --> 29:07.939
I want Ryan. Where is he?

29:07.941 --> 29:08.973
Why are you asking me?

29:08.975 --> 29:10.241
I told you, I haven't seen him!

29:10.243 --> 29:11.709
Father Jonas said

29:11.711 --> 29:13.419
you tried to take him out
of school two weeks ago.

29:13.421 --> 29:15.046
Come on. What, that day at school?

29:15.048 --> 29:17.415
All I did was try to give
the little man some money,

29:17.417 --> 29:18.606
and that freaky priest got all...

29:18.608 --> 29:21.185
Just give me my Ryan back.
This isn't funny anymore.

29:21.187 --> 29:23.387
I know you have him. I know it.

29:23.389 --> 29:25.923
Ian? Ian!

29:25.925 --> 29:26.986
Damn it!

29:27.916 --> 29:29.927
Wow. What do we do with that?

29:29.929 --> 29:31.762
Forget about asking for consent.

29:31.764 --> 29:33.931
We use this conversation to get a warrant

29:33.933 --> 29:36.734
to search lan's residence,
his cars, and his devices.

29:36.736 --> 29:39.360
I'll have patrol watch his house
while we drive there.

29:39.362 --> 29:40.445
Good.

29:41.975 --> 29:44.901
You think he's hiding
two teenagers in there

29:44.903 --> 29:46.511
with his whole inthedark family

29:46.513 --> 29:47.760
sitting around the dining room table?

29:47.762 --> 29:49.614
Probably not.

29:49.616 --> 29:52.450
Could find something in his vehicle.

29:54.087 --> 29:56.154
- Here we go.
- Michael.

29:56.156 --> 29:58.422
Ian Nuñez, we're here to serve
a search warrant

29:58.424 --> 30:00.110
- on your residence.
- You're what?

30:00.112 --> 30:01.292
We have reason to believe

30:01.294 --> 30:03.060
Ryan Rojas and Miguel Diaz
may be in your house.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.529
Ryan Rojas, Miguel Diaz...

30:04.531 --> 30:06.464
Ian, those are the boys
they're showing on television.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.032
What does that have to do with us?

30:08.034 --> 30:10.735
Ryan Rojas is your
15yearold stepson, ma'am.

30:10.737 --> 30:12.960
Congratulations. It's a boy.

30:12.962 --> 30:13.941
- Hey, come on, man.
- Wait, what?

30:13.943 --> 30:14.993
I need you both to step back.

30:14.995 --> 30:16.374
- No, you're not going...
- Now.

30:16.376 --> 30:17.608
Listen, we can talk
about this, all right?

30:17.610 --> 30:18.843
Listen, you don't have to do this.

30:18.845 --> 30:20.511
I said you don't have to do this!

30:21.514 --> 30:22.847
What the hell?

30:22.849 --> 30:24.982
Well, I thought we'd just be searching

30:24.984 --> 30:26.184
for the missing boys.

30:26.186 --> 30:28.145
But now, Ian Nuñez,

30:28.147 --> 30:30.421
you're under arrest for
assaulting a police officer.

30:30.423 --> 30:32.790
The fact that you haven't paid
child support in over a decade

30:32.792 --> 30:34.559
is not gonna look good
when you're arraigned.

30:34.561 --> 30:36.194
Child support?

31:02.521 --> 31:06.505
Hey. I thought you had
already left with Andy.

31:06.546 --> 31:09.480
No, he went to help Dr. and
Mrs. Garza at the morgue,

31:09.482 --> 31:11.983
but not before telling me you want a gun.

31:11.985 --> 31:14.786
Already? Okay, um...

31:15.670 --> 31:17.247
Well, before you say "no,"

31:17.249 --> 31:19.031
I think it's important to remember

31:19.033 --> 31:21.206
that I don't drink,
I don't do drugs, and...

31:21.208 --> 31:23.327
And technically you don't
need my permission.

31:23.329 --> 31:25.530
Right, but I also want
a concealandcarry permit,

31:25.532 --> 31:27.165
which I couldn't get on my own.

31:27.167 --> 31:29.133
And besides, I would never bring a weapon

31:29.135 --> 31:30.735
into this house without your approval.

31:30.737 --> 31:33.104
And without knowing how to use one,

31:33.333 --> 31:34.872
which is why I've scheduled us

31:34.874 --> 31:38.409
a session at the L.A.P.D.
firing range after work

31:38.411 --> 31:39.844
if I can make it.

31:39.846 --> 31:41.379
So... so you're okay with me

31:41.381 --> 31:42.947
having a concealandcarry permit?

31:42.949 --> 31:47.311
No. I'd rather you accept
an undercover detail,

31:47.313 --> 31:53.324
but as much as I hate to think
about this entire situation,

31:53.326 --> 31:55.313
you may have a point.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.930
Before your son
died, he lapsed into a coma,

31:58.932 --> 32:02.400
and I doubt he felt anything
or even knew it was coming.

32:02.402 --> 32:07.371
You'll excuse me, Doctor, if I
find very little solace in that.

32:07.373 --> 32:09.740
I spent all night with the press
outside my house

32:09.742 --> 32:13.311
shouting questions
about the death of my son.

32:13.582 --> 32:18.716
Please, I need you to release
his body to a mortuary.

32:18.718 --> 32:21.152
I'm afraid we're going
to have to keep him

32:21.154 --> 32:22.353
a little while longer.

32:22.355 --> 32:24.188
We'd like to have him cremated.

32:24.190 --> 32:25.857
He's not a criminal.

32:25.859 --> 32:27.458
He deserves a funeral.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.360
We understand that, sir,

32:29.362 --> 32:32.129
but the doctor here has some
more tests he needs to run.

32:32.131 --> 32:34.144
What for?

32:34.801 --> 32:35.967
The cause of death is obvious.

32:35.969 --> 32:37.235
What else do you need to know?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.303
To determine what, if anything,

32:39.305 --> 32:41.606
happened to your son before he died.

32:41.608 --> 32:45.276
What does that matter...
if he died from natural causes?

32:45.278 --> 32:47.211
Dr. Garza, it's not fair,
but your son's death

32:47.213 --> 32:49.447
is part of an open investigation

32:49.449 --> 32:51.782
and the cause is subject to change.

32:51.784 --> 32:54.385
Please! Please don't take him apart.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.521
Please don't cut him to pieces, please.

32:56.523 --> 32:57.989
Lucas...

32:57.991 --> 33:01.526
- Sara. Sara!
- Lucas!

33:06.132 --> 33:09.000
Sara...

33:09.002 --> 33:11.006
they've already done that.

33:12.405 --> 33:18.276
They cut him open, removed his organs,

33:18.278 --> 33:21.566
and put him back together.

33:23.016 --> 33:25.850
Step outside.

33:25.852 --> 33:27.752
Go on.

33:39.167 --> 33:43.827
Finish your tests quickly,
Doctor, or I'll have my lawyer

33:43.829 --> 33:46.771
get a court order forcing you
to release Lucas' body.

33:50.428 --> 33:53.807
My wife can't handle this much longer.

34:00.587 --> 34:03.254
Before we give up the body,
I need to know what substance

34:03.256 --> 34:05.721
was on his clothes and then check and see

34:05.723 --> 34:06.994
if it was also in his bloodstream,

34:06.996 --> 34:08.893
and those tests are going to take time.

34:08.895 --> 34:09.909
I know, Doctor.

34:09.911 --> 34:11.829
Um, did you notice Dr. Garza seemed...

34:11.831 --> 34:13.898
Probably on oxy, but no way to check

34:13.900 --> 34:15.333
without a warrant for his blood.

34:15.335 --> 34:17.735
Perhaps grief drove him back
to bad habits.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.217
Or guilt.

34:19.219 --> 34:22.540
Addicts don't need a reason
to use, only an excuse.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.275
Let's just hope he doesn't act
on his threat to call a lawyer.

34:25.277 --> 34:29.313
So far, his son is the only
true evidence we have.

34:34.097 --> 34:36.053
You didn't find any dead 15yearold boys

34:36.054 --> 34:37.588
in my house, right?

34:37.590 --> 34:39.210
Big surprise.

34:39.212 --> 34:42.021
And that other lady cop,
she broke my nose,

34:42.023 --> 34:43.928
and she put me in jail for nothing.

34:43.929 --> 34:46.981
That other lady cop did you a big favor.

34:46.983 --> 34:49.567
If there was ever a night
you want to spend in jail,

34:49.569 --> 34:53.237
it's the night that your wife
finds out that she has a stepson

34:53.239 --> 34:54.839
you never told her about.

34:54.841 --> 34:56.172
Speaking of Ryan...

34:56.175 --> 34:58.392
<i>I have no idea where he is.
If I did, I'd tell you.</i>

34:58.394 --> 35:00.077
Commander.

35:00.079 --> 35:01.312
<i>What, you think I...</i>

35:01.314 --> 35:02.513
We got something back on Marv Garret

35:02.515 --> 35:03.881
if you want to hear about it.

35:03.883 --> 35:06.803
Detective Paige,
if you would help the FBI

35:06.805 --> 35:09.320
prepare a briefing while we
finish this interview, please?

35:09.322 --> 35:10.721
You bet, Commander.

35:15.428 --> 35:17.428
<i>What, you think I wanted</i>

35:17.430 --> 35:19.735
<i>to have my wife dragged into this?</i>

35:19.737 --> 35:20.786
<i>My children?</i>

35:20.788 --> 35:22.946
You people may have
just ruined my whole life,

35:22.948 --> 35:25.055
and for what? For nothing.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.308
What did I ever do to Ryan?

35:26.309 --> 35:28.066
What, except try to give him some money?

35:28.068 --> 35:29.588
I would've also taken him out to lunch

35:29.590 --> 35:31.055
if that asshole priest hadn't stopped me.

35:31.056 --> 35:32.188
He does way too much.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.523
He's, he's helping Ryan out

35:33.525 --> 35:34.924
with his homework after school.

35:34.926 --> 35:36.860
He's... he's taking him to the movies.

35:36.862 --> 35:38.862
He is... he's teaching him how to drive.

35:38.864 --> 35:42.432
Doing all the stuff that you
would rather be doing with Ryan.

35:42.434 --> 35:44.406
Look, all I'm saying

35:44.408 --> 35:46.770
is Father Jonas is a lot more involved

35:46.772 --> 35:49.939
in that kid's life
than the average teacher.

35:49.941 --> 35:51.040
Look, II got to go.

35:51.042 --> 35:52.776
I've got to talk to my present wife,

35:52.778 --> 35:54.410
<i>if she hasn't already packed up
her stuff and left.</i>

35:54.412 --> 35:55.779
<i>No, no, you're staying here with us.</i>

35:55.781 --> 35:58.418
What? Why? You didn't find
nothing at the house.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.283
I told you everything I know.
You got to let me leave.

36:00.285 --> 36:01.818
There's just this little issue

36:01.820 --> 36:03.586
of you assaulting a police officer.

36:03.588 --> 36:05.622
AAssau... Assaulting? As...

36:05.624 --> 36:08.358
I gave her a little push,
and look what she did to me!

36:08.360 --> 36:09.930
Bitch. Okay, fine,

36:09.932 --> 36:11.783
you want to have me arraigned,
I want a lawyer.

36:11.785 --> 36:12.919
How 'bout that?

36:12.921 --> 36:15.598
It's not gonna help you, but okay.

36:16.616 --> 36:18.434
Father Jonas again.

36:19.805 --> 36:22.472
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but the FBI

36:22.474 --> 36:25.141
stumbled on something
that actually might help.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.544
Turns out Marvin Garret does
more than just make calls to ICE

36:27.546 --> 36:29.379
about his neighbors.

36:29.381 --> 36:32.348
We found an IP address linked
to a computer he uses at home.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.817
Not sure who owns the website,

36:33.819 --> 36:35.952
but it's called unhyphenatednation.com,

36:35.954 --> 36:37.854
and Marvin is its administrator.

36:37.856 --> 36:39.622
"Unhyphenated Nation" is dedicated

36:39.624 --> 36:42.045
to the end of multiculturalism
and the removal

36:42.047 --> 36:44.089
of all extensions to the word "American."

36:44.091 --> 36:46.529
For example, the hyphens
between AfricanAmericans,

36:46.531 --> 36:48.643
MexicanAmericans, AsianAmericans...

36:48.645 --> 36:51.434
What about IrishAmericans
and ItalianAmericans?

36:51.436 --> 36:53.406
That doesn't seem to come up.

36:53.408 --> 36:54.704
Unhyphenated's main issue

36:54.706 --> 36:56.906
appears to be crimes by illegal aliens.

36:56.908 --> 36:59.411
The site is operated by Marvin?

36:59.413 --> 37:01.717
Under the pseudonym "Buddy E. Lee,"

37:01.719 --> 37:02.937
so he didn't pay for it,

37:02.939 --> 37:04.614
and it's not listed under his real name,

37:04.616 --> 37:06.616
which is why it slipped by you guys.

37:07.167 --> 37:10.186
You see? The Patriot Act
comes in handy now and then.

37:10.188 --> 37:12.689
A disgusting website isn't enough

37:12.691 --> 37:14.457
to arrest this Marvin dirtbag.

37:14.459 --> 37:17.363
Or even get us a warrant
to search his property.

37:17.365 --> 37:21.598
But he also posts a podcast
and lots of YouTube videos.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.333
There's about 150 hours

37:23.335 --> 37:25.283
of Marvin Garret shooting off
his mouth here.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.341
Really?

37:26.343 --> 37:28.137
He might slip up,
admit to something illegal.

37:28.139 --> 37:30.807
Yeah, but who has time to listen
to all that bullshit?

37:38.948 --> 37:41.551
Just give me the files.

37:43.255 --> 37:44.854
And one other thing...

37:44.856 --> 37:48.524
Marvin Garret has a federal
license to sell firearms.

37:48.526 --> 37:50.660
How on earth did Marv... okay.

37:50.662 --> 37:53.129
What I don't understand
is why would these boys

37:53.131 --> 37:56.186
have gotten into a car with Marvin?

37:56.188 --> 37:57.178
Maybe they didn't.

37:57.180 --> 37:58.398
Maybe they got into a car

37:58.400 --> 37:59.802
with his unhyphenated daughter.

37:59.804 --> 38:01.873
And before we direct all our resources

38:01.875 --> 38:03.907
at Marvin Garret, I have news.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.209
- From where?
- The Office of the Archdiocese.

38:06.211 --> 38:09.345
Since Father Jonas was blocking
us, I found an intern there

38:09.347 --> 38:12.181
who volunteered a little info
before she realized

38:12.183 --> 38:15.585
it would be frowned upon by her
holierthanthou superiors.

38:15.587 --> 38:18.232
Beguiling an intern. For shame.

38:18.234 --> 38:20.556
Well, you can't beguile someone
who doesn't want to be beguiled.

38:20.558 --> 38:21.991
I've tried.

38:21.993 --> 38:24.663
Anyway, before she realized
I was L.A.P.D.,

38:24.665 --> 38:27.330
our lovely intern gave up what
might be damning information

38:27.332 --> 38:28.431
on Father Jonas.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.133
What sort of damning information?

38:30.135 --> 38:32.635
He's been transferred
to six different dioceses

38:32.637 --> 38:34.103
over the past five years.

38:34.105 --> 38:37.974
Monterey, Tucson, Denver,
Reno, Phoenix, and L.A.

38:37.976 --> 38:39.643
And two of these transfers

38:39.645 --> 38:41.777
happened in the middle
of the school year.

38:41.779 --> 38:44.047
Sounds like another one of the Church's

38:44.049 --> 38:46.749
triedandtrue tactics
to cover up sexual abuse.

38:46.751 --> 38:49.819
Well, our priest has told us
over and over

38:49.821 --> 38:52.121
how close he is to these boys.

38:52.123 --> 38:53.990
Intensely close.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.927
And Father Jonas
gave Ryan driving lessons.

38:57.929 --> 39:00.496
Yeah, well, front seat or back?

39:00.989 --> 39:03.232
Could've been the trunk.

39:03.867 --> 39:05.576
All right, Lieutenant.

39:05.578 --> 39:09.505
Since Father Jonas won't come
to us, let's go to him.

39:19.888 --> 39:25.592
Your weapon is your last resort, always.

39:25.594 --> 39:26.729
I understand.

39:26.731 --> 39:27.896
Try again.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.529
I want you to remember

39:29.531 --> 39:32.265
that this training is about the gun.

39:32.267 --> 39:34.167
It is not about the soul.

39:34.169 --> 39:37.537
Taking a human life
upclose is very hard.

39:37.539 --> 39:41.154
You need to put some serious
thought into how...

39:54.623 --> 39:56.156
Well, right now, all I need

39:56.158 --> 39:59.092
is for Phillip Stroh
to stand completely still.

39:59.094 --> 40:02.762
That's not bad for your third try.

40:03.932 --> 40:05.094
Hold on.

40:08.770 --> 40:10.170
Yes, Lieutenant?

40:10.172 --> 40:12.873
Have you picked up our
welltravelled priest yet?

40:13.102 --> 40:16.843
What sort of problem?

40:16.845 --> 40:18.245
Sharon, your detectives

40:18.247 --> 40:19.779
can't look through our private quarters.

40:19.781 --> 40:21.148
You were fine with us

40:21.150 --> 40:22.315
searching the whole property
yesterday morning.

40:22.317 --> 40:23.783
We're just here for Father Jonas.

40:23.785 --> 40:25.318
You can't keep us from his room, Father.

40:25.320 --> 40:27.554
I stopped by a judge's house
on the way here.

40:27.556 --> 40:30.490
I have a search warrant
for the entire rectory.

40:30.492 --> 40:33.026
- There's no need, Sharon.
- I disagree.

40:33.028 --> 40:36.963
Father, forgive us our
trespasses and step aside.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.539
L.A.P.D.! Open up!

41:02.191 --> 41:06.526
Well, our person of interest
is definitely not at home.

41:06.528 --> 41:08.628
I see.

41:13.329 --> 41:14.834
Where'd he go?

41:15.790 --> 41:18.371
Father Jonas has left the country.
