{\an8}but this time she sunk
to an all-new low

01:42.902 --> 01:44.404

post-breakup

before we had
a chance to speak privately.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.811
{\an3}Hey, boo.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.282
What's wrong?

01:56.349 --> 01:57.784
Well, I know what's wrong.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.253
{\an5}Yeah, so...

01:57.851 --> 02:00.253
Girl... why is A.D. showing

02:00.320 --> 02:03.756
her natural ass
on social media like that?

02:03.823 --> 02:05.325
If she gonna post
and say this is

02:05.391 --> 02:07.360
{\an1}supposed to be personal
between family and friends,

02:07.427 --> 02:10.295
why is she going public saying
that you guys aren't together?

02:10.363 --> 02:11.965
{\an1}Yeah, we go through
ups and downs,

02:12.031 --> 02:13.366
but we don't go
through anything

02:13.433 --> 02:16.269
{\an4}that any other couple
doesn't go through.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.269
{\an3}Right.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.705
{\an1}So... she broke up with me
in a text, so I'm like--

02:18.771 --> 02:20.540
{\an8}That's how y'all broke up?

02:20.607 --> 02:21.808
{\an1}Yeah, so I'm like,
"Something's not right."

02:21.875 --> 02:24.777
{\an1}So I go to her
friend's Instagram Story,

02:24.844 --> 02:27.080
{\an1}and in the background
of a video,

02:27.146 --> 02:30.450
I see her in the pool with
a bitch between her legs.

02:30.517 --> 02:34.387
{\an1}In the text, she said that
she can't stand to be around me,

02:34.454 --> 02:36.356
she cringes when I kiss her...

02:36.422 --> 02:38.558
{\an4}(emotionally)
...she knew she was never
planning to give me the ring,

02:38.625 --> 02:41.594
{\an1}she's not in love,
she's been wanting out,

02:41.661 --> 02:42.962
{\an4}and I--

02:41.661 --> 02:42.962
I thought you guys
were doing good.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.330
I knew you guys were
going to therapy,

02:44.397 --> 02:45.932
you guys were...
you know, you guys were

02:45.999 --> 02:47.967
trying to work through it.

02:48.034 --> 02:53.306
{\an4}(tearfully)
You know, and all she does
is make it seem like it's me.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.908
She basically told me, like,

02:54.974 --> 02:57.777
{\an1}the pain that Kamron will feel
from this breakup...

02:57.844 --> 02:59.846
{\an1}(sniffles)
...is my fault.

02:59.913 --> 03:03.750
{\an4}Is my fault,
and then she's like...

02:59.913 --> 03:03.750
Moniece, she's trying
to mind(bleep) you.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.318
She wants you to feel bad

03:05.385 --> 03:07.186
and she wants you
to take her back.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.488
{\an1}It's never felt
like this before,

03:08.555 --> 03:11.157
{\an1}and at this point,
there's no coming back,

03:11.224 --> 03:13.860
{\an1}so, like, I had the conversation
with Kamron last night,

03:13.927 --> 03:17.997
{\an1}and I'm like, "This is the end,"
and that was, like, the worst.

03:18.064 --> 03:21.601
{\an1}She basically told me,
"If he calls, I won't answer."

03:21.668 --> 03:24.871
{\an5}My son is not
a (bleep) toy.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.871

Let her free herself.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.440
If she don't wanna
be with you, Moniece,

03:27.507 --> 03:29.108
you don't need to be
with her.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.910

But for A.D. to make Moniece

into this drama?

03:38.484 --> 03:39.919
I'm not with it.

She's using your son

{\an1}Clearly this is

14:08.881 --> 14:11.250
{\an3}No threats.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.052
{\an1}If you think it's a game,
go on, play with me.

14:13.118 --> 14:14.153
{\an5}Don't threaten me...

14:13.118 --> 14:14.153
I'm letting you know.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.654
{\an1}I don't do well with it
and you know--

14:15.721 --> 14:17.323
{\an5}I know what I'm talking about.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.323
Okay, but I don't understand

14:17.389 --> 14:19.291
why you can't trust me
to do what I need to do.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.393
{\an5}I told you--

14:19.358 --> 14:21.393
{\an1}And you know that I'm gonna
take care of it properly.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.596
{\an1}Listen, it's only one thing
that's off the table.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.532
{\an4}Do not go to the studio
with Roccstar.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.532
You're always drawing
these lines.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.567
I've been here before.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.003
Marcus is my man,
but I do not like it

14:31.070 --> 14:33.806
when he draw these lines
and boundaries for me.

14:33.872 --> 14:36.542
Last year, he didn't want me
hanging around Booby.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.078
This year he doesn't want
me hanging around Roccstar.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.480
Calm down and let me do
what I do.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.482
{\an1}My job is to be
a protector and a provider,

14:43.549 --> 14:44.984
{\an1}and if you're not gonna
let me protect you,

14:45.050 --> 14:47.620
then maybe we need to even
figure out what we doing.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.255
What, you gonna
call off the engagement?

14:49.321 --> 14:51.090
{\an5}Go ahead and play with me--

14:49.321 --> 14:51.090
You gonna take your ring back?

14:51.156 --> 14:54.860
{\an1}Listen, all I know is,
if I can't tell my woman...

14:54.927 --> 14:57.930
{\an1}that she shouldn't be somewhere
without her going anyway,

14:57.997 --> 14:59.865
we have a serious
misunderstanding.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.468
And I feel like
if I can't tell my man

15:02.534 --> 15:04.470
to trust me
while I handle something,

15:04.536 --> 15:06.105
then we got
a serious problem.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.040
But it seems like we got
a serious problem then.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.241
Well, we do.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.776
You heard what I said.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.544
{\an1}I meant what I said,
so go on, play with it.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.519
{\an8}It's Marcus Black.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.656
{\an7}Marcus-- he wants me to
steer clear of all the mess.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.624
{\an8}But musically,
you can't let somebody

15:25.691 --> 15:26.892
{\an8}dictate what you got
going on.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.028
{\an8}You might as well
just go in the booth,

15:29.094 --> 15:30.329
{\an8}do your thing...

15:29.094 --> 15:30.329
{\an7}(sighs)

Yo, this daddy thing is crazy.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.383
I did not know that babies
needed this many diapers.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.885
So I called the homie Roccstar
to help me,

15:52.951 --> 15:55.487
'cause I got diaper
after diaper after diaper.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.789

16:04.129 --> 16:06.165
I want you to see the baby.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.668

16:25.317 --> 16:26.452
but you know what?

16:26.518 --> 16:27.953
Safaree is really
the one to blame.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.290
The homie backtracking is
really making me look messy.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.393
A1 and I might be going through
it, but he's still my brother.

Man, look, man.

an album release party.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.686
{\an1}I need you
to clear the schedule out.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.688
I got Teairra Mari hosting.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.423
{\an5}It's a vibe!

17:02.755 --> 17:04.423
{\an3}Mm-mm.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.656
{\an1}I'm telling you,

17:21.906 --> 17:24.443

17:21.906 --> 17:24.443
As a focused, married man.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.676
{\an5}I always forget, man--

17:24.510 --> 17:25.676
As a married man--

17:25.743 --> 17:27.445
{\an1}--that y'all was in love

17:30.315 --> 17:32.351
We was cool...

17:32.418 --> 17:34.253

17:34.319 --> 17:35.821
{\an4}Okay.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.821
--and she's cool.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.457
It's not like that.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.159
Why are you involved?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.261
{\an5}Listen, man.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.261
Why? Like, are y'all
doing music?

17:42.327 --> 17:44.296
{\an5}Are y'all messing around?

17:42.327 --> 17:44.296
It, it's not, no, no.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.497
{\an5}No messing around.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.497
So then, so then--

17:45.564 --> 17:46.999
{\an5}Not no music either.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.999
--what would it be then?

17:47.065 --> 17:49.701
{\an5}What it is, is, man,
her cousin hit me up.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.701
{\an3}Yeah.

17:49.768 --> 17:50.969
It's a dude I grew up with,

17:51.036 --> 17:52.271
used to do (bleep) with,
all kind of ridiculous--

17:52.337 --> 17:54.206
we used to run around
and just... when I...

17:54.273 --> 17:55.674
{\an5}in my burnt-out days.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.674
{\an3}Yeah.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.277
{\an1}He hit me like, "Yo, can you
go look out for my cousin, man?

17:58.343 --> 17:59.745
"She got a sex tape out and,"

17:59.812 --> 18:01.280
you know, "this dude is
bullying her right now,"

18:01.346 --> 18:02.414
{\an4}you know.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.414
{\an3}Damn.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.516
{\an1}I met up with her,
she told me he's a...

18:04.583 --> 18:06.051
a polygamist?

18:06.118 --> 18:08.687
{\an1}He got six wives, she was
gonna be the seventh-- uh-uh.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.923
{\an4}I really, honestly don't know
what's going on.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.923
{\an3}Whoa!

18:10.989 --> 18:12.958
{\an5}Jesus Christ!

18:10.989 --> 18:12.958
I just... it's crazy.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.093
{\an4}I need your help, man,
'cause you know her.
I don't know her.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.229
{\an1}I'm caught up
in the middle of the situation,

18:17.296 --> 18:18.397
{\an1}you know what I'm saying
and all?

18:18.464 --> 18:19.832
{\an1}I'm not really
knowing what's going on.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.400
Look, man, here's the thing.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.735
When, when I was with her,
we was both, like,

18:23.802 --> 18:26.572
{\an1}at a time when it was just...
it wasn't, it wasn't right.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.106
{\an4}Yeah.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.106
Like, we was both...

18:28.173 --> 18:29.475
{\an4}Yup.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.475
going through (bleep),
you know what I'm saying?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.810
And then I moved on,
she moved on.

18:31.877 --> 18:34.680
{\an1}I met Princess, fell
in love and then got better.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.849
{\an1}Right.
And she met Akbar.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.418

not find the person

you on the other side.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.522
{\an1}Yeah.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.224
Because everybody deserves
to have a new life

18:45.290 --> 18:48.494
{\an1}and be good and,
and live good and start over.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.763
You have it in your mind that
you thinking about doing it,

it's in your heart--

19:02.140 --> 19:03.208
And somebody got her back.

she ain't slept with nobody

you can't let somebody

27:05.557 --> 27:07.392
{\an5}and that's fine.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.392
Let me,
let me say one thing.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.861
A.D., you know
I've been in relationships

27:09.928 --> 27:11.396
since I've had Kam,

27:11.463 --> 27:14.032
and...
my exes ain't around.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.635
You gotta respect
the kid's mom.

27:17.702 --> 27:20.238
If she don't want you around
'cause y'all not together,

27:20.305 --> 27:22.040
then you're not gonna be
in Kam's life.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.476
{\an5}(Moniece)
I understand
that A.D. and Kamron

27:24.542 --> 27:26.711
have developed a bond
over the last two years,

27:26.778 --> 27:30.248
but she's not a parent,
she's not a stepmom.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.784
If A.D. and I finally
put the nail in the coffin

27:32.851 --> 27:34.786
and we decide to break up
for good,

27:34.853 --> 27:37.589
it's not healthy
to expose my son to all of that.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.090
This relationship is toxic.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.725
This relationship
is dysfunctional.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.861
{\an1}Like, the arguments
are intense.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.497
{\an1}They make me feel things that
I don't like about myself.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.899
{\an5}I don't wanna be around you.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.899
Right. About you.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.467
{\an5}It doesn't-- right.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.467
You can't face (bleep).

27:49.534 --> 27:51.836

27:49.534 --> 27:51.836

27:51.903 --> 27:54.205
{\an4}Right.

27:51.903 --> 27:54.205
And you couldn't get
to bottom of it

27:54.272 --> 27:56.141
for the sake of
the (bleep) relationship--

27:56.207 --> 27:58.276
{\an1}No, I can't, 'cause you're
too toxic for me.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.811

No, you don't.
