don't worry about a thing.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.156

should be falling out.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.129

05:11.144 --> 05:12.729
I was just with Dr. Hibbert.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.731
He said I was under
a lot of stress

05:14.814 --> 05:16.524
and should get some help.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.694
Marge, whatever it takes
to make you well, we'll do it.

05:19.777 --> 05:23.865
Well, I was thinking we could
hire a nanny to help me out.

05:23.948 --> 05:27.285
-A nanny?
-But how am I supposed to pay for that?

05:27.368 --> 05:28.745
We'll find a way.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.705
Mom has made
so many sacrifices for us

05:30.788 --> 05:32.790
it's time we gave up
something for her.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.917
I'll stop buying
Malibu Stacie clothing.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.295
And I'll take up smoking
and give that up.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.921
Good for you, son.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.090
Giving up smoking
is one of the hardest things

05:41.174 --> 05:42.759
you'll ever have to do.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.135
Have a dollar.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.720
But he didn't
do anything.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.639
Didn't he, Lisa?
Didn't he?

05:48.723 --> 05:51.017
Hey, wait a minute.
He didn't!

05:51.100 --> 05:53.603
Homie, please.
I never ask for much,

05:53.686 --> 05:55.897
but this is something
I really need.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.398
All right, Marge.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.734
I'll get you your nanny.
And to pay for it,

05:59.817 --> 06:03.529
I'll give up the civil war
re-creation society I love so much.

06:03.613 --> 06:08.242
Well, Homer's out. We got to find
a new General Ambrose Burnside.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.037

you're looking for a nanny.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.841
-Pleased to meet you.
-Wait a minute, Marge.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.635

06:25.718 --> 06:27.887

06:27.970 --> 06:29.430

06:29.514 --> 06:32.517

06:32.600 --> 06:34.685
Homer, if you're going
to do this to every applicant,

06:34.769 --> 06:35.978
we're never going
to find one.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.480

06:46.906 --> 06:48.366

06:48.449 --> 06:49.826
Thanks. Where do you
keep the liquor?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.619
I hide a bottle of schnapps

06:51.702 --> 06:53.246

06:53.329 --> 06:54.747

I'm Shary Bobbins.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.617
Did you say Mary Pop--

08:54.700 --> 08:56.077
No, I definitely did not.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.290
Now, as your nanny,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.626
I'll do everything

09:10.299 --> 09:13.302
Now, Miss Bobbins,
if you want this job,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.513
you're going to have
to answer a few questions.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.223
First, do you have
any bad habits?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.226
No. I'm practically perfect
in every way.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.520
Well, so am I.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.355
(gulping loudly)

09:24.438 --> 09:26.232
(belching)
Ah!

09:26.315 --> 09:29.277
(sighs)
Okay. Question two.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.987
Who was your last employer?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.155
Lord and Lady Huffington
of Sussex.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.283
(whispers)
Marge, do we know them?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.994
-No.
-Come on. Isn't he the guy I bowl with?

09:38.077 --> 09:39.870
-The black guy?
-That's Carl.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.124
Oh, yeah! So you worked
for Carl, eh?

09:43.207 --> 09:45.334
I have a question.
Pop quiz, hotshot.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.378
I'm supposed
to be doing my homework,

09:47.461 --> 09:49.839
but you find me upstairs

09:49.922 --> 09:53.884
What do you do?
What do you do?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.470
I make you read every
article in that magazine,

09:56.554 --> 09:58.806
including Norman Mailer's
latest claptrap

09:58.889 --> 10:00.558
about his waning libido.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.144
Ooh. She is tough.

to be true.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.413
I'll say. Her butt waxed
the bannister.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.166

10:25.249 --> 10:26.834
