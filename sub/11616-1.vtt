Hey, you, sit down.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.773
All right.

Everybody remember,

01:49.310 --> 01:51.376
We're here to help
sick people feel better,

01:51.378 --> 01:53.178
So behave yourselves.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.514
Quentin, are you allowed
to do that at home?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.782
No.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.617
Ok, you guys.
We're getting off here.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.586
I want you all
to stick together, please.

I say about waiting?

02:10.331 --> 02:11.897
Why they bringing
rats here?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.532
They help doctors
fight diseases.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.534
Duh, thomas.
Lab rats. Hello?

02:15.536 --> 02:19.571
Enough with the rats.
Let's go.

02:19.573 --> 02:23.342
Quentin,
don't make me yell.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.544

02:33.954 --> 02:35.287
You understand
the precautions

02:35.289 --> 02:37.789
We need to take,
dr. Sanders?

02:37.791 --> 02:40.492
Yeah. I got it.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.595
Tell me
one more time.

02:43.597 --> 02:49.067
Uh, I had just
started rounds.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.170
The first patient
was moved to radiology

02:51.172 --> 02:52.671
Before I saw her.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.574
The second was asleep.
We had no contact.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.609
The third was
the syrian kid.

Sanders, voice-over: There
was no exposure to fluids,

03:03.450 --> 03:05.150
Dr. Cannerts, no
high-risk contact.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.351
Are you certain?

03:06.353 --> 03:09.188
I think so, yes.
Ah-choo!

03:09.190 --> 03:10.789
[coughing]

03:15.261 --> 03:17.629
When I went back
to look in on him,

03:17.631 --> 03:18.931
He was gone.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.399
I tracked him down,

03:20.401 --> 03:22.301
Tried to convince him
to stay for observation.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.636
He didn't speak
much english,

03:24.638 --> 03:27.272
But his friend said
he wanted to go home.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.441
The address
is on the chart.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.914
The chart.

I'm sorry.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.062
Got held up
with the coffee,

04:24.064 --> 04:25.163
And then there was
this whole thing

04:25.165 --> 04:26.932
With the van
we got.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.467
Mm, thank you.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.470
Hey, what,

04:31.472 --> 04:34.206
Are you coming down
with something?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.508
Uh...

04:36.510 --> 04:38.176
- Not again.
- I'm fine, lex.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.544
No, you're not fine.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.780
You're having one of
your things, your moments.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.916
It is nothing to get
worked up about.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.420
I'm just a little
overwhelmed, is all.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.855
On the day you're supposed
to move in with me...

04:49.857 --> 04:50.689
I know.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.124
- After 3 years,
- I know, lex.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.759
- Two failed attempts?
- I know. It's just a lot--

04:53.761 --> 04:56.795
You're not even
done packing yet.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.263
I have jake outside

04:58.265 --> 04:59.431
Waiting to help me
move you.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.266
Yeah. I'm sorry, hmm?

05:01.268 --> 05:03.635
I was just having
a moment, all right?

05:03.637 --> 05:06.004
It was just a dumb
moment of doubt.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.272
You know what
those are like.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.541
No. I don't know
what they're like

05:09.543 --> 05:12.911
Because I don't
have them.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.883
Let's go.
She's not coming.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.351
Not coming?

05:19.353 --> 05:21.620
No. She's not
moving in, jake.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.956
Want me to go
talk to her?

05:24.958 --> 05:27.359
That is pretty much
the last thing I want.

05:27.361 --> 05:31.029
[cell phone rings]

05:31.031 --> 05:33.231
Carnahan. Yeah.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.700

I'll be there.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.336
We got to go.
I have a briefing.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.537
For what?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.505
Some health
department thing.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.041
I don't know.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.544
[sighs]

05:49.015 --> 05:50.882
Man: How you doing, lex?

05:50.884 --> 05:51.983
[door closes]

05:51.985 --> 05:53.752
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, chief.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.220
I just got the call.
I was--

05:55.222 --> 05:57.055
Getting ditched
by your girlfriend.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.557
[snickers]

05:58.559 --> 06:00.992
That's real nice,
gentlemen. Thanks.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.527
So what's going on?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.429
Possible
flu outbreak.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.565
Man: State and local officials
are present.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.266
We're still waiting
on federal.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.602
Dr. Cannerts is here
from the cdc.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.803
That's a lot of
important people

06:11.805 --> 06:13.739
Just to talk
about flu shots.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.707
Cannerts: I've e-mailed you
the security footage

06:15.709 --> 06:17.843
Showing the young,
middle eastern man in question.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.578
We checked
his registration forms.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.713
His address and insurance
information are fraudulent,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.615
Which may mean
he's illegal.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.585
We know for a fact
that he's contagious.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.054
Chief besser, we need
local police to pick him up.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.255
Besser: We're on it.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.257
This is major alex carnahan,
zone 6.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.792
He'll be running point.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.227
Man: Well, then maybe
he ought to get on it

06:35.229 --> 06:36.528
Before some kid
from the middle east

06:36.530 --> 06:37.763
Gives us all
the plague.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.030
Zone 6 will
get it done, billy.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.333
We always do, just like
last week's game

06:41.335 --> 06:43.368
Against you fine fellas
from zone two.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.804

06:45.806 --> 06:47.372

such a good time.

and human services.

shake your hand.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.383
Nothing personal.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.352

are here.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.387
- Do we have gema present?
- Here.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.922
- Eis?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.158
Cdc.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.728
Most of you don't know me,
but the fact that I'm here

07:09.730 --> 07:11.830
Should have you worried
because I don't get called

07:11.832 --> 07:15.667
Until things get bad,
so let's get started.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.270
Dr. Cannerts has identified
a possible public health threat.

and the street below â™ª

07:34.254 --> 07:35.520
Mom, I have to--

07:35.522 --> 07:37.322
Take your 15.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.523
You're making me
take a break

07:38.525 --> 07:40.091
Because
I have to pee?

07:40.093 --> 07:41.760
I'm making you take a break
because that's how long

07:41.762 --> 07:43.128
It'll take you to mosey
back up here

07:43.130 --> 07:46.198
After you send your 20 texts
to your boyfriend.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.167
Teresa, I'm gonna need you
for inventory at 1:00,

07:49.169 --> 07:50.769
And you have
your appointment

07:50.771 --> 07:52.971
At the adoption agency
at 4:00.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.208
No, ma. I have
your appointment.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.747
[dog barking]

08:03.649 --> 08:05.450
You shouldn't
be here.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.786
My mom's already
in a mood.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.888
I had to check
on my girls.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.056
Come here.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.862
Look. We're all set for
the 1:30 to north springs.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.864
My mom has a doctor she
wants you to see tomorrow.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.365
That's nice
because mine's got

08:20.367 --> 08:23.335
Adoption agencies
on speed dial.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.237
Can you push it
to the 3:00?

08:25.239 --> 08:27.405
I have to help my mom.
She'll know if I bail.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.040
We're running
away together.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.475
They're gonna
notice eventually.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.144
Yeah, but a head start
wouldn't suck.

08:33.146 --> 08:36.681
Ok. 3:00.
No problem. Heh.

08:37.483 --> 08:40.252
Um...

08:40.254 --> 08:42.654
- Xander...
- Yeah?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.489
Are you sure this
is what you want?

08:44.491 --> 08:46.391
Of course it is.
I love you.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.426
But I need to know
you're all in,

08:48.428 --> 08:51.730
That you're doing this
because you want to be doing it.

08:51.732 --> 08:55.333
Teresa, I love you,

08:55.335 --> 08:58.703
And I love
our kid already.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.840
What else is there?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.575
Ok. Good.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.677
Yeah. Yeah.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.446
Look. We are gonna
make this work,

09:08.448 --> 09:11.516
And we are
gonna be happy.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.218
Gonna see you
at 3:00?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.886
I'll see you
at 3:00.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.522
Ok.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.558
Cannerts: The patient
was highly febrile

09:19.560 --> 09:21.560
And presented
with pharyngitis, headaches,

09:21.562 --> 09:23.094
And swollen lymph nodes.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.864
Dr. Rita sanders
was the attending on rounds.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.801
Within 16 hours,
dr. Sanders became symptomatic,

09:29.803 --> 09:31.570
Suggesting that the virus
can replicate

09:31.572 --> 09:33.505
At an accelerated rate.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.373
Sabine: Dr. Cannerts,
is it your belief

09:35.375 --> 09:37.275
That he
is patient zero?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.344
Patient zero
for a flu?

09:39.346 --> 09:42.147
Cannerts: Since then, there are
3 more symptomatic patients--

09:42.149 --> 09:44.616
Two nurses
and dr. Sanders' boyfriend.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.719
Each can trace contact exposure
to dr. Sanders.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.788
Besser: Why are we
just hearing about this?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.122
Local police are
brought into the loop

09:51.124 --> 09:53.858
At such time as
protocol dictates.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.328
Dr. Cannerts,
what do you advise?

09:56.330 --> 09:58.964
We should lock down the hospital
while we confirm

09:58.966 --> 10:01.700
That the syrian man is, in fact,
the initial carrier.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.135
Now, the faster we can initiate
contact tracing,

10:04.137 --> 10:06.404
The faster we can contain
this outbreak.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.173
Agreed.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.008
What is it?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.509
I didn't catch
what the virus is

10:11.511 --> 10:12.978
We're talking about.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.546
Sabine: Well, that's part
of the problem, major.

10:14.548 --> 10:17.582
It's not currently presenting

You get me instead.

Don't "what" me.
You know what.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.129
I had a moment
of indecision, ok?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.165
The guys had an over/under
on how long it would take

11:40.167 --> 11:41.933
Before you freaked
and pulled the plug.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.202
Well, the guys need to
mind their own business.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.171
You can't string him

Oh, just because
you dated me

11:52.112 --> 11:53.478
For 5 minutes does not
make you an expert.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.246
Ha! The fact that you
dumped me after 5 minutes

11:55.248 --> 11:57.382
Kind of makes my case
for me, don't you think?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.783
I'm at work.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.385
You guys
are it, jana.

You two have that--

And everyone seems
to know it but you.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.660
No. I know it, ok?
Of course I know it.

Who was that?

12:18.438 --> 12:21.639
Jana. I was
giving her grief.

12:21.641 --> 12:22.974
- Heh.
- Listen.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.375
There's a syrian kid

12:25.312 --> 12:27.045
I'll call you
with the details.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.646
Jake, you'll
run point.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.781
I thought I was
running point.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.116
I changed my mind.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.218
What, is this because
I took the under on jana?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.886

12:51.071 --> 12:53.638
Please tell me this isn't
some kind of ebola thing.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.440
They don't know
what it is.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.210
So what did
she say earlier

12:59.212 --> 13:00.912
When she answered
your call

13:00.914 --> 13:03.481
Instead of all 10
of mine?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.949
She's just being
jana, man.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.184
She'll come around.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.786
Yeah? Well, maybe
this time, I won't.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.721
Ha ha ha!

13:09.723 --> 13:11.089
You want me to call
bull on that,

13:11.091 --> 13:13.491
Or you want--you want
to call on yourself?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.094
Look. I got
to head downtown.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.929

I guess I do, officer.
Ha! Guess I do.

- All right.
- Get it.

Ok. We're all here.

Excuse me.

I'm sorry, but I have to ask
you guys to come back in.

I can't let you go.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.572
Bobby: Please. We'll explain
once everyone gets back inside.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.073
You heard the doctor.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.975
Looks like our field trip
has been extended.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.476
- Aww!
- Aww!

Hang on a minute,

You, too, sir.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.924
- Mom--
- quentin, stay with me.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.026
Bobby: It's better
if you don't touch.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.965
While you move inside,
you'll all need to keep

14:26.967 --> 14:28.666
4 to 6 feet apart.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.576

14:42.282 --> 14:44.215
Aw, jana, again?

15:15.849 --> 15:18.683
Well, all right, then.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.936
Major carnahan,
thank you for meeting me.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.170
Oh, you can
call me lex.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.471
You seem
important enough.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.775
Ha ha! Certainly act
like it, don't I?

15:43.777 --> 15:46.277
Please.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.251
Lex, I asked for you
because you strike me

15:53.253 --> 15:55.887
As someone who could be
a benefit in this situation.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.455
People seem
to like you,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.157
And situations like this
are made or broken

15:59.159 --> 16:01.526
By the civilians'
response to authority.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.228
I need someone on the street
who can keep people calm.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.597
No offense,

keeping people calm

16:10.303 --> 16:12.170
Is my job,
so I'm not so sure

16:12.172 --> 16:14.272
What you're
asking here.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.875
There are gonna be a lot
of opinions flying around.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.711
The cdc's credibility
took a few hits

16:19.713 --> 16:21.179
During
the ebola crisis.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.047
Social media is gonna
break this before we do,

16:23.049 --> 16:24.515
And once the media
gets hold of it,

16:24.517 --> 16:28.553
Well, we're
gonna need a face,

16:28.555 --> 16:29.921
A man of the people,

16:29.923 --> 16:31.356
Someone they inherently
want to trust.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.425
This is in your zone.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.096
This kid, if he wasn't
middle eastern,

16:38.098 --> 16:42.166
Would we be taking
all these precautions?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.502
It is because he's syrian
that there is

16:44.504 --> 16:48.439
An elevated concern
about bioterrorism, yes.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.942
Lex, I recognize that
there's a lot going on here

16:50.944 --> 16:53.111
Behind closed doors.

If I can count on you,
your access will grow

In direct proportion to your
level of cooperation.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.017
Oh, I got to be honest,
ms. Lommers.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.184
That sounds
like a bribe.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.420
It's an incentive.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.257
I've been doing this
job for 12 years.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.092
The reason people
like me is because

17:08.094 --> 17:10.828
I'm fair,
I'm honest,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.097
And I got
a great jump shot.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.233
I don't need access.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.435
What I need
is the truth,

17:17.437 --> 17:18.903
And I'm
not convinced

17:18.905 --> 17:20.938
That's what
I'm getting here.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.857
Until the people find a
kardashian to distract them,

17:39.859 --> 17:42.493
But I've never seen anything
like this virus before.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.096
How we handle it,
how we handle ourselves

17:45.098 --> 17:47.598
Will determine whether
or not we survive it,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.467
So you want the truth?

17:49.469 --> 17:52.103
If we blow this,
it's not just a hospital

why you'd let him go.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.787
I'm not
letting him go.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.822
Yeah, right.

18:10.824 --> 18:11.923
It was perfect
the way it was.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.291
Why mess it up
by living together?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.725
It's called
commitment.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.327
Oh, yeah.
You should talk.

with dennis.

believes in commitment?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.302
I didn't say you
should be like me.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.037
Why are you giving me
a hard time?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.005
Because I know
your game.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.540
It's just like
in the group homes.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.808
Don't let them get
too close because

18:30.810 --> 18:32.143
They're either gonna
give you the boot

Or you're gonna
get taken away.

Clever bastard.
That's right. Ha ha!

19:55.562 --> 20:00.164
Hmm. Yeah.
I'll go to your place.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.732
Just until
this blows over.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.234
No, lex.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.469
I mean, I'm in for good like
I should've been this morning.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.206
- You are?
- I am.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.142
I love you.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.777
I'll go.

20:12.779 --> 20:16.380
Good. Good.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.382
I'll see you tonight.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.651
Katie: A potential exposure.
That's all they said.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.753
Britney had the sniffles,
so they took her

20:22.755 --> 20:24.789
For more observation,
but her mom's boyfriend--

20:24.791 --> 20:27.358
The bus driver, yeah--
says she's got hay fever.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.426
Hey, stop that.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.561
Hey, you guys,
no running, ok?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.296
Hey, I'm talking
to principal watkins.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.932
Mary, no touching,

Grace, I can't talk right now.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.244

I'm as concerned as you are.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.745
Man: It should be
just a few more hours,

20:47.747 --> 20:49.747
But I won't be able to make
your grandma her lunch.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.149
- Could you help?
- Did you call my mom?

20:52.151 --> 20:53.651
She's busy
at the store, she said.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.186
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

20:55.188 --> 20:56.621

Copy that.

[beep]

21:20.980 --> 21:23.214
All right. The doctors told lex
it only seems to be spread

21:23.216 --> 21:26.317
Through fluids--
blood, sweat, semen, urine.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.686
There's 100%
a joke there.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.755
Yeah? Well, keep it
to yourself.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.123
Put gloves on
and lower your visor.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.126
Don't touch anything

- Yeah.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.030
Jim banks, eis.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.431
You take the lead.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.166

21:53.546 --> 21:56.681
Great.
You know this person?

21:57.549 --> 22:00.384
I don't recognize him.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.787
Sure that seems
like a smart answer,

22:02.789 --> 22:04.622
Except that a city
traffic camera

22:04.624 --> 22:06.357
Captured the tags
on your car

22:06.359 --> 22:07.591
When it was used
to pick him up

22:07.593 --> 22:09.627
From atlanta midtown

22:09.629 --> 22:11.529
Hey, look, sir. I'm not
with immigration.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.730
We've been asked
to bring him in as it

22:12.732 --> 22:14.632

viral outbreak.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.500
Your friend's health

22:22.308 --> 22:24.075
He's my nephew.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.210
Good. Thank you.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.746
You need to step back.

Monday.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.333
How?

22:49.335 --> 22:51.836
He flew in the hold
of a cargo plane.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.071
His father got him
on the plane.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.272

23:02.515 --> 23:03.681
Those
militant groups,

23:03.683 --> 23:05.216
They tried
to recruit him.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.051
He wanted to
come to america,

23:07.053 --> 23:08.419
To his family.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.887
Yeah. Th--that's great,

23:09.889 --> 23:12.056
Who he's been
in contact with.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.324
He hasn't
left the house

23:13.326 --> 23:14.859
Except to go
to the hospital.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.061
That flight took
a lot out of him.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.498
He had a cold,
nothing more.

the rats, too.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.778
No one's seeing
the rats, mary.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.213
The rats are probably
the last thing

They want us
to see right now.

get to go on the tour?

I'm gonna head
to the precinct.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.876
Actually, I think
it would be wise,

25:11.878 --> 25:14.178
Considering
the contact you had,

25:14.180 --> 25:16.046
If you stayed here
a while.

nothing to worry about.

for my son and his friend.

in the research labs.

know if it's bad...

miss.

26:09.135 --> 26:13.003
And my son quentin, I didn't
just let him run off.

I was talking to parents.

to get in there.

a couple young kids.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.715
They'd have been heading
for the research labs.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.016
Can we just take
a quick look?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.685
I can't let you
in there.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.353
Please, I just
need to look.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.121
Hey, 4 to 6 feet.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.157
The officer and I were
just in the same hallway

26:33.159 --> 26:35.292
As the infected man.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.894
Better not get
too close.

you're a cop, man.

to do, shoot her?

Hey.

27:30.149 --> 27:34.051
Dr. Cannerts,
do you have an update?

27:34.053 --> 27:38.255
At 1500 hours, our patient zero
took a turn for the worse.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.924
The virus appeared to be causing
acute encephalopathy

27:40.926 --> 27:43.160
In addition to severe
hepatic injury.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.896
His symptoms escalated to what
can be best described

27:45.898 --> 27:49.299
In layman's terms as rabid.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.702
[grunting]

27:51.704 --> 27:54.438
Cannerts: At 1627,
there was extreme hemoptysis

27:54.440 --> 27:55.539
And hemorrhaging.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.274
[coughs]

27:57.276 --> 28:00.978
Cannerts: This was followed
by a series of seizures.

28:00.980 --> 28:05.616
At 1629, patient zero
was pronounced dead

28:05.618 --> 28:09.787
And his attending
placed in isolation.

28:09.789 --> 28:13.857
Soon after,
dr. Sanders succumbed.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.161
Her boyfriend died
shortly after that.

as sayid nassir

early symptoms.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.007
He was fine.

a bad cold.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.281
You did this.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.950
This confirms our assessment
that sayid

28:39.952 --> 28:42.519
Is indeed patient zero.

28:42.521 --> 28:45.723
Given this information,
I'm afraid I must declare

The virus as
extremely pathogenic,

28:48.728 --> 28:51.495
Highly contagious,
and fatal

about sticking close?

[cell phone rings]

30:11.143 --> 30:13.310
[beep]

30:13.312 --> 30:15.345
Angry mother?

30:15.347 --> 30:17.815
Something like that.

30:17.817 --> 30:21.118
I, uh, share custody
with his dad's parents.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.555
Long story.
Tonight's their night.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.523
You're under lockdown.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.092
You think that would
make a difference, huh?

30:29.094 --> 30:31.728
Yeah. I would. Ha ha!

30:31.730 --> 30:33.497
Anyway, they live
in fear that something

30:33.499 --> 30:35.499
Will go wrong
on my watch,

30:35.501 --> 30:39.503
And I live in fear of
them being right, so--

30:43.374 --> 30:45.309
Bobby: What are you
doing down here?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.144
My son quentin--

30:47.146 --> 30:49.213
They're officially putting
the hospital on lockdown.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.014
We're already
on lockdown.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.183
Well, they don't want anyone
leaving for 48 hours.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.152
- 48 hours?
- Got to be kidding me.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.653
Look. I'm not
gonna lie to you.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.755
This is a unique situation,
but we're in good hands.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.324
We just have
to trust the system.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.192
Follow the rules, and
everything will be f--

31:02.194 --> 31:04.094
Ah-choo!

31:04.096 --> 31:08.098
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Ok. Back up. Back up.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.101
Katie, go get that other
doctor, cannerts, now.

31:11.103 --> 31:15.372
Step aside.
Sir, step aside!

31:15.374 --> 31:18.375
Damn it!

31:18.377 --> 31:20.811
Sabine: Dr. Cannerts
has had a breakthrough

31:20.813 --> 31:23.247
In defining the virus.

31:23.249 --> 31:26.083
Cannerts: According to the
latest diagnostic information,

31:26.085 --> 31:28.385
The agent has been identified
as influenza "a"

31:28.387 --> 31:31.088
With hemagglutinin 7
and neuraminidase 2,

31:31.090 --> 31:35.125
Or h7n2, an avian influenza
that, until now,

31:35.127 --> 31:38.262
Has not been known to be
transmitted between humans.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.098
It appears the genome of
this virus has been manipulated

31:41.100 --> 31:43.066
To give it higher
pathogenicity

31:43.068 --> 31:46.003
And to make it capable
of human-to-human transmission.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.405
We discovered a vial
in patient zero's belongings

31:48.407 --> 31:50.841
That had traces
of a biological agent.

31:50.843 --> 31:53.110
We must assume he brought it
into the country

31:53.112 --> 31:56.413
And into the hospital,
where he infected dr. Sanders.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.148
[murmuring]

31:58.150 --> 32:00.017
Given the threat
of bioterrorism,

32:00.019 --> 32:02.519
This is now a matter
of national security.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.088
As such, I recommend
that we institute

32:05.090 --> 32:07.424
Top-level containment measures
to protect the citizens

32:07.426 --> 32:10.060
Of this city
from any further exposure.

32:10.062 --> 32:13.363
What, exactly, are top-level
containment measures?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.666
Sabine: At this point,
protocol demands that we release

32:15.668 --> 32:17.601
All nonessentials from the room
while federal, state,

32:17.603 --> 32:19.770
And local health confer
with the governor's office

32:19.772 --> 32:21.705
And the chief of police.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.541
Thank you.

32:27.045 --> 32:32.316
Nonessentials.
That would be you, major.

32:51.302 --> 32:55.472
Teresa: It's all good, grandpa.
I got to go.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.842
I'm catching a train
to north springs to see xander,

32:58.844 --> 33:01.511
Our little secret, ok?

33:03.848 --> 33:06.249
I will. I love you, too.

33:12.390 --> 33:16.226
Man: Crazy.
They'll back in.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.395
What's the deal?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.665
Hey, what's up
with this?

33:24.502 --> 33:29.239
Man: This station is now closed.
I need you to exit the platform.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.807
Up the stairs.
Let's go.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.876
Different man: Let's go, folks.
Up the stairs.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.212
Miss, please.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.280
Everyone.
Let's go.

33:38.816 --> 33:42.152
Jana, things have gotten a
little crazier since we talked.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.087
Don't go back to your place
to pick up your stuff.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.922
Go straight to mine.
You'll be safe there.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.225
Call me as soon
as you get in ok.

[cell phone chirps]

33:49.695 --> 33:51.228
Hey, man,
where are you?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.397
I'm at the hospital.
I can't leave. I'm stuck.

33:53.399 --> 33:54.831
Lex: You're part
of the lockdown.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.067
Yeah. I'm in the middle
of the damn hot zone, lex.

33:57.069 --> 34:00.904
I mean, some guy just
sneezed 4 feet from my face!

34:00.906 --> 34:02.139
Listen to me.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.540
I have an in
with the governor.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.308
No, lex. They're not
gonna let me out.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.310
I had contact
with patient zero.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.780
I mean, it's the freaking
zombie apocalypse

34:09.782 --> 34:10.981
Up there in
isolation ward.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.349
- I'm not getting out.
- Jake--

34:12.351 --> 34:14.985
Screw you, lex,
all right?

34:14.987 --> 34:17.521
You're the one
who sent me in here.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.789
Jake. Ja--

34:37.575 --> 34:41.945
Sabine: I really appreciate
all of you coming.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.513
Ms. Lommers,
I asked you what

34:43.515 --> 34:45.348
Your intentions are
for our city.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.783
It's dr. Lommers,
actually,

34:46.785 --> 34:48.585
Since you're insisting
on remaining formal,

34:48.587 --> 34:50.487
And you don't fall
within protocol.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.056
Screw protocol!

34:53.058 --> 34:55.425
Now, you want me
out there in zone 6

34:55.427 --> 34:57.360
Representing
your message,

34:57.362 --> 34:58.795
You want me
on your side, fine.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.564
I'm on your side.

35:00.566 --> 35:03.400
Tell me what
you're doing.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.502
We're gonna institute
a cordon sanitaire

35:05.504 --> 35:07.771
To contain the spread
of the virus.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.739
What the hell
is that?

35:09.741 --> 35:12.509
It means we're placing
your zone of the city

35:12.511 --> 35:15.645
Under complete
quarantine.

please back up.

- Keep this tight, all right?
- Let us through.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.724
Trust me, you don't want
to be back on that side.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.826
Trust me.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.662
Sabine: It is an admittedly
controversial action,

But a cordon sanitaire has shown
to be highly effective

In sierra leone keeping
ebola under control.

With the governor at the helm,
local and state officials

36:15.040 --> 36:18.208

outline the proper measures

for all involved.

But I couldn't
get past 10th.

They shut down
the trains.

It is imperative
that you stay inside

And remain
in home quarantine.

president are in full support.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.647
It's only 48 hours,
a minor inconvenience

Compared to what could happen
if we do not take

she's fine.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.918
Her allergies cleared right up
when they got her

37:34.920 --> 37:36.453
Into isolation.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.557
Sabine: Each access point
to the exposure area

37:40.559 --> 37:45.228
Will be cordoned off,
the borders being north avenue,

37:45.230 --> 37:47.597
The northeast beltline,
freedom parkway,

37:47.599 --> 37:50.267
And spring street northwest.

will be shut down.

away from each other.

37:59.378 --> 38:02.646
It is imperative
that you stay inside

38:02.648 --> 38:05.949
And remain
in home quarantine.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.784
Sabine: Given the data
we've gathered,

38:07.786 --> 38:09.486
The incubation period
is anywhere

38:09.488 --> 38:12.522
From 16 to 48 hours
after exposure.

only 48 hours.

1, 2, 3.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.570
Do you have
everything you need?

39:00.572 --> 39:02.472
Yes. Teresa took
good care of me.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.907
I'll be all right.

disease-free,

39:17.189 --> 39:18.922
Our lives can go back to normal.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.124
Until then, have faith
in the authorities

39:37.008 --> 39:38.742
Now back up, please.

I need you to find somewhere
to stay for the next 48 hours.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.980
48 hours?

39:43.982 --> 39:46.649
The city crisis center
will help you make arrangements.

39:46.651 --> 39:49.219
I know it's an inconvenience,
but, trust me,

39:49.221 --> 39:51.588
It will be worth it.

Man: Get your hands off of me.
You can't do this.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.556
- Just stay down. Stay down.
- What are you doing?

40:26.558 --> 40:28.458
Let me in. I'm just
trying to get inside.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.626
You can't
go in there.

- Hey! Hey! Hey.
- Get off of me.

40:32.330 --> 40:36.433
He's just a kid, pete.
Take a walk.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.704
Hey, I can't let you
through there.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.206
I'm sorry, but it's
for your own good.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.407
My girl is
in there waiting.

40:44.409 --> 40:46.810
So is mine.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.611
If I let you through
that barrier,

40:48.613 --> 40:50.046
I'm risking
your life,

40:50.048 --> 40:51.681
And if we let anyone out,
we're risking the lives

40:51.683 --> 40:53.683
Of everyone
in this city.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.853
I can't be that person.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.555
I can't let you
be that person.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.656
- You understand me?
- Come on.

40:59.658 --> 41:02.192
Do you
understand me?

41:02.194 --> 41:03.393
Yes.

41:03.395 --> 41:04.761
Now look.

41:04.763 --> 41:07.397
We have to trust the
doctors, all right?

41:07.399 --> 41:10.366
They'll find a way
to stop this.

41:10.368 --> 41:13.303
Everything will be
fine, all right?

41:13.305 --> 41:16.206
- All right?
- Ok. Ok.
