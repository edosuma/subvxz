00:02.001 --> 00:03.294
Previously on Lost:

00:08.217 --> 00:10.301
Did you say something to my boy?

00:10.386 --> 00:13.429
- I need to talk to you.
- You speak English?

00:13.514 --> 00:16.641
My husband doesn't know.
He has a bad temper.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.017
I need your help.

00:18.102 --> 00:20.353
Where are you?
Where are you?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.021
Where are you?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.178
Hell of a book.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.279
It's about bunnies.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.409
You must be cold without your trunks.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.244
You bet.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.205
How about you come a little closer
and warm me up?

01:21.999 --> 01:24.834
You sure know how to make
a girl feel special, Sawyer.

01:29.673 --> 01:33.718
You're incredible, Sawyer.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.557
I love you.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.689
Look at you.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.445
What do you want?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.363
Right now.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.078
How could I want anything else?

02:12.382 --> 02:15.134
- Uh-oh, baby.
- "Uh-oh," what?

02:15.219 --> 02:18.554
- I thought you had a meeting.
- Yeah, but it's not until 3:30.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.765
Baby, it's 3:28.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.561
Damn it.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.439
Damn it.
Baby, why don't you just...

02:28.524 --> 02:30.316
Just go. You go, OK?

02:30.400 --> 02:34.278
I'll stay here, order room service,
get fat...

02:34.363 --> 02:36.697
Why don't you order a chocolate sundae.

02:36.782 --> 02:40.910
When I get back,
I'll use you as a dish.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.383
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.041
What're you doing in my stuff, son?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.087
This is gonna hurt.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.553
Ready to tell me what happened?

03:40.637 --> 03:44.223
We were trying to find the source
of the distress call.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.893
I saw the flare from the beach

03:46.977 --> 03:49.979
and then the flare from
Sawyer's position in the jungle.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.732
I switched on my antenna,

03:52.816 --> 03:55.318
activated the transceiver...

03:56.194 --> 03:58.779
...and then darkness.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.325
Whoever hit me came from behind.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.329
- They destroyed the equipment?
- Yes.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.041
We're gonna figure this out.
But don't...

04:10.125 --> 04:14.378
I will do what I need to do
to find the man responsible.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.839
We need some help over here!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.435
What happened?

04:32.522 --> 04:33.689
Sawyer.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.677
Morning delivery.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.471
You're sweet. Thanks.

05:05.555 --> 05:09.308
Well, I figured in your condition,
with the extra baggage, you know.

05:09.393 --> 05:13.187
- Well, I can still walk.
- Barely.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.315
Anyway, I worry about you out here.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.651
It's very sunny.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.277
Thus my hat.

05:20.404 --> 05:23.489
There's plenty of hats in the caves.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.908
And we got a doctor.
That'll come in handy.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.495
- I like the beach, Charlie.
- Yeah.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.915
Who wouldn't want to spend the day
with sand fleas?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.585
I want to be here.
For when we get rescued.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.840
When we get rescued.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.925
Right.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.854
Jack, it's fine.
It's just a scrape.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.732
Yeah, lots of scrapes today.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.777
I'm running out of peroxide.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.030
- He just jumped me, man.
- Why?

06:06.616 --> 06:10.077
- Shannon has asthma.
- Asthma?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.164
- Never seen her have an attack.
- She had an inhaler.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.207
She sneaks hits
when no one's looking.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.877
Been embarrassed about it
since she was a kid.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.588
Guess breathing's not cool.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.716
- Had an inhaler?
- It ran out a couple days ago.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.385
But I had four refills,
enough for a couple months.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.305
She forgets her medication,
so I put it in my suitcase.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.058
Today I see that jackass reading
Watership Down.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.186
- You're losing me.
- It was in my bags, stuff I checked.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.104
If he has my book,
he has my luggage.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.107
If he has the luggage,
he has the inhalers.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.698
Her breathing got really
rough today, man.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.827
If she has an attack,
it's not gonna be good.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.757
Where is it?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.218
Hey, doc.
Long time, no see.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.761
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.388
The girl's asthma medicine.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.474
Shannon. Her inhalers.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.727
- Oh, that.
- Attacked a kid for helping his sister.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.147
No, I whooped a thief because
he was going through my stuff...

07:20.232 --> 07:21.982
- Yours?
- ...which I had to move.

07:22.067 --> 07:25.402
You take something out of a suitcase
and that makes it yours?

07:25.487 --> 07:30.032
I don't know what kind of commie
share-fest you're running in Cave Town,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.493
but down here,
possession's nine-tenths.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.412
- Man's got a right to protect property.
- Get up.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.375
- Why? You wanna see who's taller?
- Get up!

07:39.459 --> 07:43.379
- Sure you wanna make this your problem?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.052
What's going on here?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.775
You told me you were going
to Baton Rouge to close a deal.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.278
Just trust me.
There isn't any time to explain.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.029
I'm already late.

08:09.114 --> 08:13.200
If I miss this meeting,
the whole deal's a bust, all right?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.999
That's everything I have, $140,000.

08:21.001 --> 08:25.671
There's an oil mining operation in
the Gulf of Mexico, drilling platforms.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.632
$300,000 buys you one share.

08:28.717 --> 08:32.595
But as soon as you invest,
a government-sponsored fund kicks in

08:32.679 --> 08:35.847
and triples your money in two weeks.
Triples it.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.392
- Three hundred thousand?
- Yeah.

08:38.476 --> 08:42.020
- You got 140.
- I found an investor in Toronto.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.688
He wants in 50-50.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.901
In two weeks, we'll be splitting
almost a million bucks.

08:46.985 --> 08:51.071
Jess, this is my chance.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.328
There's another option.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.038
Yeah? And what's that?

08:59.122 --> 09:02.833
That I give you the 160,000
and we split the profit.

09:02.918 --> 09:08.297
Yeah? And how in the hell are you
gonna scare up 160,000 bucks?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.716
My husband.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.719
I'm gonna kill him.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.264
- That won't help us get the medicine.
- But it'll feel good.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.600
So, what's stopping you?

09:20.769 --> 09:24.647
We're not savages, Kate.
Not yet.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.650
Let me talk to Sawyer.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.237
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to you?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.988
He says we have a connection.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.747
- Do you?
- Please.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.677
What do you want?

09:57.472 --> 10:01.684
- Excuse me?
- What do you want, Sawyer?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.980
Freckles, I got so many answers
to that question,

10:06.064 --> 10:08.274
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.193
What do you want for the inhalers?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.782
Good question.
Hang on a tick.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.703
What do I want?

10:24.082 --> 10:25.958
A kiss ought to do it.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.502
- What?
- A kiss.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.546
From you. Right now.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.509
I don't buy it.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.387
- Buy what?
- The act.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.724
You try too hard, Sawyer.

10:42.559 --> 10:48.188
I ask you to help a woman who can't
breathe and you want me to kiss you?

10:49.024 --> 10:51.650
Nobody's that disgusting.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.654
I've seen you, you know.

10:55.739 --> 10:59.158
- Seen me what?
- With that piece of paper.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.244
The one you keep in your pocket.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.622
I've seen the expression
on your face when you read it.

11:05.707 --> 11:10.419
How carefully you fold it up.
It means something to you.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.589
So you can play games
all you want,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.717
but I know there's a human being
in there somewhere.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.469
Give me the medication.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.014
- You think you understand me?
- Yeah.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.766
- I think I have...
- Shut up!

11:26.353 --> 11:29.480
Wanna know what kind
of human being I am?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.274
Read it.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.282
Read it. Out loud.

11:45.288 --> 11:48.290
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.251
you don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

11:51.336 --> 11:53.962
and I know what you've done.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.676
You had sex with my mother,

11:59.761 --> 12:03.263
and then you stole
my dad's money all away.

12:03.807 --> 12:09.144
So he got angry,
and he killed my mother.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.064
And then he killed himself, too."

12:12.148 --> 12:14.316
Don't stop now.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.568
You're getting to the good part.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.242
"All I know is your name.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.703
But one of these days I'll find you
and give you this letter,

12:26.788 --> 12:29.581
so you'll remember
what you done to me.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.462
You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer."

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
Now, about that kiss.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.693
I didn't think so.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.711
Locke.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.548
Where were you last night,
around sunset?

13:20.717 --> 13:24.011
Well, I'm afraid the only witness
to my whereabouts is the boar

13:24.095 --> 13:26.972
that I was skinning for our dinner.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.641
I heard you were trying
to send out a distress call?

13:29.726 --> 13:33.020
So it would seem whoever
attacked you has a reason

13:33.104 --> 13:35.189
for not wanting to get off the island.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.987
Maybe someone who is profiting
from our current circumstances?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.325
And from what I've seen,
you and Mr. Sawyer

13:46.409 --> 13:48.410
share a certain animosity.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.537
No, he has an alibi.

13:50.622 --> 13:54.124
Just before I was struck,
he set off a bottle rocket,

13:54.209 --> 13:56.919
a signal we'd worked out,
two kilometers away.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.004
He couldn't have had the time...

13:59.088 --> 14:02.966
Unless he found a way to time-delay
the fuse on his rocket.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.346
- How could he...?
- Anyone who watches television

14:07.430 --> 14:10.098
knows how to improvise a slow fuse.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.102
Use a cigarette.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.532
Just in case there's a next time.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.048
Just try to breathe.
Breathe.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.551
Come on, Shannon, work with me.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.983
Give me the inhalers.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.401
Now.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.781
Hell, I was wondering when you
were gonna stop asking nice.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.169
Well, it's about time, cowboy.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.881
I've been telling you since day one
we're in the wild.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.092
Didn't think you had it in you.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.855
Is that all you got?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.965
I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.133
Why not?

16:08.217 --> 16:12.471
Because business between friends
is always a little sticky.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.725
I don't know you well,
but I know your wife,

16:16.809 --> 16:18.977
working with her
at the auto dealership.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.979
I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.

16:21.064 --> 16:24.066
Louisiana will invest two-thirds
of the drilling cost.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.318
What is this, a loophole?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.987
Look, David, you're reluctant.
I get it.

16:29.072 --> 16:31.448
You got your lumberyard,
you don't need this.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.951
- We should do this.
- Jess, I don't even know this guy.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.620
Show him the cash.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.718
- How do I know this is real?
- The money?

16:52.178 --> 16:55.180
Hell, how about you
hold on to it for a night.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.641
Check it out.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.309
I want you to feel secure.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.528
You know what?
Let's not do this.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.030
I've got another investor
who's committed.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.990
That should cover lunch.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.326
And I'll see you Monday.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.704
- David.
- David.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.497
Wait.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.877
Warm, fluffy towels.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.839
Your turn.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.387
- Banoffi pie.
- You already said that.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.973
Toffee and cream.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.726
Is food the only thing that you miss?

17:40.810 --> 17:44.730
You're pregnant.
I mean, do you not crave anything?

17:44.814 --> 17:48.233
Pickles? Fried ice cream?
Chocolate...

17:48.317 --> 17:50.193
Peanut butter.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.822
I'm the only Australian
who loves peanut butter.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.241
I can get you peanut butter.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.161
- Yeah. Sure you can.
- Yes, I can.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.581
When I get you peanut butter,
you vacate this shore of depression

18:02.665 --> 18:04.875
and move to the caves.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.503
Deal?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.381
Deal.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.803
Help! She's not breathing!

18:16.888 --> 18:18.722
The attacks are getting worse.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.640
Shannon? Listen to me.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.434
Look at me.
Look at me.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.395
You need to listen now.
This isn't just the asthma.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.355
It's anxiety. It's in your head.
Yes.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.859
You know that your medicine's
run out, and you're panicking.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.612
Look at me.
But we can fight this.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.281
Together. OK?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.992
Nod your head, Shannon.
Good.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.245
- Breathe in...
- She needs her inhaler.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.956
Breathe in through the nose.
Slowly.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.751
No, no, no. In through the nose.
Like this.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.754
You can do this, Shannon.
You can do it.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.881
In through the nose.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.310
You got your breath.
Yeah, your color's coming back.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.978
See? I knew you could do this.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.730
Do you feel it?
It's passing.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.026
OK. Again.
In through the nose.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.365
All right. Just keep doing that.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.201
Keep breathing like that.
That's perfect. Good job.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.960
Keep her relaxed.
Do not let her panic.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.965
Wow, man. That was awesome.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.593
I mean, that was like a...

19:39.262 --> 19:41.763
...Jedi moment.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.230
Jack!

19:50.731 --> 19:53.441
What will happen if she doesn't
get her medicine?

19:55.278 --> 19:57.529
Then we have to make Sawyer
give it to us.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.239
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.033
No, not you. Me.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.536
I served five years
in the Republican Guard.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.496
You were a communications officer.

20:06.581 --> 20:10.375
Part of my training entailed
getting the enemy to communicate.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.922
Just give me ten minutes with him.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.716
He'll give us the medicine.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.849
Is that a yes?

20:27.685 --> 20:29.144
Yes.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.444
Food from the plane's
been gone over a week, dude.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.238
What, no secret stash for emergencies?

20:40.323 --> 20:42.699
You and Jack have
a bunch of stuff in that cave.

20:42.783 --> 20:43.909
Sorry, man.

20:43.993 --> 20:47.579
No peanut butter, no peanuts,
no nothing.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.164
Yeah, but...

20:49.248 --> 20:52.667
There's got to be something.
I mean, look at you.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.716
- Look at what?
- No, no, listen...

20:59.800 --> 21:02.052
- Fat guy hoarding the food, you think?
- No.

21:02.136 --> 21:05.639
We've been here for two weeks,
you know, and you've not really...

21:05.723 --> 21:07.933
- Slimmed down?
- All I need's a bag...

21:08.017 --> 21:10.185
I have no food, all right?

21:12.021 --> 21:15.190
And for the record,
I'm down a notch on my belt.

21:16.484 --> 21:20.111
I'm a big guy. It's gonna be a while
before you give me a piggyback ride.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.365
Sorry.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.492
- That was bad form.
- Yeah.

21:25.576 --> 21:28.536
- I'm used to it.
- So there's not even a bag of...

21:28.621 --> 21:30.580
- Dude.
- OK.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.123
All right. I'm sorry.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.717
Damn, stupid...

21:48.224 --> 21:50.016
Michael?

21:50.768 --> 21:53.061
The sick girl.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.358
- Yeah, asthma.
- Yes, asthma.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.444
I think I can help her.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.872
Good morning.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.297
What are you doing?

22:23.551 --> 22:27.137
- Jack!
- This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.639
If you do this...

22:37.690 --> 22:41.776
Well, ain't you the brave one?
Jumping a guy while he's napping.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.494
I'm in trouble now, ain't I?

22:55.499 --> 22:57.500
Sawyer...

22:58.919 --> 23:02.130
We gave you the chance
to do the right thing.

23:02.214 --> 23:07.510
Now, all I want is the asthma medicine.
Just tell me where the inhalers are...

23:07.595 --> 23:09.554
...and we'll stop.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.182
Stop what, Chico?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.319
It doesn't have to be this way.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.948
Yeah, it does.

23:40.336 --> 23:43.338
We do not have bamboo in Iraq,

23:43.422 --> 23:47.092
although we do have
something similar. Reeds.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.552
But their effect is the same

23:49.637 --> 23:53.014
when the shoots are inserted
underneath the fingernails.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.352
You know what I think, Ali?

23:57.436 --> 24:00.855
I think you've never actually
tortured anybody in your life.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.360
Unfortunately for us both...

24:07.029 --> 24:09.030
...you're wrong.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.716
That's it?
That's all you got?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.427
Splinters?

24:31.512 --> 24:33.763
No wonder we kicked your ass
in the Gulf...

24:42.064 --> 24:43.231
Sayid.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.775
Sayid!

24:52.449 --> 24:55.493
No. Don't stop now.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.662
I think my sinuses are clearing.

24:57.746 --> 25:01.291
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Perhaps losing an eye...

25:01.709 --> 25:03.668
...will loosen your tongue.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.422
OK!

25:07.506 --> 25:08.590
OK.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.845
Where is it?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.390
The only person I'll tell...

25:18.559 --> 25:20.268
...is her.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.191
- Kate?
- That's the deal.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.072
Tell me, Sawyer, do you want to die?

25:36.410 --> 25:39.245
'Cause when a man
walks into my place

25:39.330 --> 25:44.876
and tells me he left 160,000
of my hard-won dollars

25:44.960 --> 25:48.171
in the care of a civilian,

25:48.255 --> 25:51.549
I gotta ask myself if what I'm hearing
isn't a desperate cry

25:51.634 --> 25:54.594
for the sweet release of death.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.306
The deal closed today.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.684
See, women are easy.

26:01.769 --> 26:05.605
A few Cosmos, a couple of stunts
they haven't seen between the sheets

26:05.689 --> 26:08.066
and they think the scam is their idea.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.361
Now, the husbands...
They need to touch the money.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.862
Smell it.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.907
Believe if they had the brass
to put that case

26:15.991 --> 26:18.660
in the trunk of their family sedan
and speed away,

26:18.744 --> 26:22.121
they just might have a chance
at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.208
OK, Tex.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.710
You got your grift so pat...

26:29.630 --> 26:31.547
...what did you need my money for?

26:32.091 --> 26:34.592
Where's your seed
from the last couple you roped?

26:34.677 --> 26:36.719
Well, what can I say?

26:36.804 --> 26:40.556
I like earning it
as much as I like spending it.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.938
Be that as it may,

26:47.022 --> 26:50.149
I know a thing or two
about making people suffer.

26:50.234 --> 26:54.779
Now, you have my money,
plus 50% by noon tomorrow,

26:55.489 --> 26:57.865
or I'll tell you all about it.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.934
So I'm here.
Where is it?

27:27.563 --> 27:31.941
Happy to tell you,
soon as I get that kiss.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.528
What? Are you serious?

27:35.612 --> 27:39.490
Baby, I am tied to a tree
in a jungle of mystery,

27:39.575 --> 27:42.493
and I just got tortured
by a damn spinal surgeon

27:42.578 --> 27:44.829
and a genuine Iraqi.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.749
Of course I'm serious.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.336
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Freckles.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.838
You're really gonna let
that girl suffocate

27:53.922 --> 27:57.175
because you can't bring yourself
to give me one little kiss?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.887
Hell, it's only first base.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.639
Lucky for you I ain't greedy.

28:12.983 --> 28:20.114
OK.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.545
I don't have it.

29:18.048 --> 29:19.632
What?

29:22.344 --> 29:24.846
The medicine.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.057
I don't have it. Never did.

29:28.142 --> 29:32.437
The book. They said
you found it in their luggage.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.398
Book washed up on shore.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.734
Went in the drink
with the rest of the...

29:52.082 --> 29:54.959
- He doesn't have it.
- What?

29:55.043 --> 29:58.963
He's lying. Can't you see that?
He's been lying from the beginning.

29:59.047 --> 30:02.091
He doesn't want us to get off.
That's why he attacked me.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.886
- Hold on a minute.
- He destroyed the transceiver!

30:04.970 --> 30:07.388
You don't know that.
Sayid.

30:32.414 --> 30:33.623
You hit an artery.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.875
Keep still, damn it.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.088
Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves.
My leather backpack.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.423
Go!

30:45.385 --> 30:47.386
Can you make it stop?

31:06.532 --> 31:10.618
Whose blood is that?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.870
Sawyer.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.749
You went after Sawyer
and didn't tell me? She's my sister.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.501
Boone!

31:19.628 --> 31:21.629
Don't leave me alone, OK?

31:30.055 --> 31:31.973
I'm not going anywhere.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.141
OK?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.644
OK.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.070
These the right ones?

31:46.154 --> 31:49.657
- I think I found the right tree...
- Let me see.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.243
Oh, yes. Good.

32:21.648 --> 32:22.648
Don't, man.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.027
I'm telling you.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.237
Don't.

32:40.876 --> 32:43.461
Let go. I know you want to.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.296
Shut up,
and stop moving.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.633
You've been waiting for this.
You get to be a hero again,

32:48.717 --> 32:52.219
because that's what you do.
You fix everything up all nice.

32:54.806 --> 32:59.352
Tell him to let go, Freckles.
We already made out.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.395
What else have I got to live for?

33:03.565 --> 33:07.360
Hey, Jack, there's something
you should know.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.529
If the tables were turned...

33:12.115 --> 33:14.283
...I'd watch you die.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.163
Alrighty.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.292
Looks like we're in the oil business.

33:23.377 --> 33:25.795
- We're cool?
- Oh, we're cool.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.924
- We get the money back...
- A week from tomorrow. Tripled.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.594
- You're not gonna skip town, are you?
- David, for God's sake.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.722
He left all his money with us.
We could've skipped town.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.183
A smart woman you got there, David.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.394
Don't let her go.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.774
Hi, baby.
What are you doing up?

33:46.900 --> 33:48.776
Are you feeling better?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.112
Will you read to me?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.948
In a minute, sweetheart.
We have company right now.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.376
Are you OK?

34:05.460 --> 34:06.794
Deal's off.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.630
- Excuse me?
- Deal's off. Forget it.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.716
- What are you doing?
- Is this a joke?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.967
- Walking away.
- You're not walking out.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.554
Know what I had to do for this,
all this in one day?

34:16.638 --> 34:18.514
Take your hand off me, boy.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.306
- Sawyer?
- What's going on here?

34:20.391 --> 34:23.728
This isn't how it was supposed to work.
You said that we were...

34:23.812 --> 34:25.603
He said?
What did he say, Jessica?

34:55.552 --> 34:57.762
You're lucky to be alive.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.808
Jack?

35:03.727 --> 35:06.395
He went to the caves
to check on Shannon.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.485
I read it again.
And then again.

35:12.569 --> 35:15.237
I've been trying to figure out
why you beat up Boone

35:15.322 --> 35:19.033
instead of just telling him
you didn't have his sister's medication.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.535
Why you pretended to have it anyway.

35:21.620 --> 35:26.415
The thing that I keep coming back
around to is that you want to be hated.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.544
And then I looked at the envelope.

35:31.755 --> 35:35.049
"America's Bicentennial.
Knoxville, Tennessee."

35:36.176 --> 35:37.718
You were just a kid.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.720
- Eight, maybe nine years old.
- Kate.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.556
This letter wasn't written to you.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.892
You wrote this letter.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.148
Your name's not Sawyer, is it?

35:55.403 --> 35:56.904
It was his name.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.908
He was a confidence man.

36:01.409 --> 36:05.162
Romanced my momma
to get to the money.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.750
Wiped them out clean,
left a mess behind.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.045
So I wrote that letter.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.550
I wrote it knowing
one day I'd find him.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.762
But that ain't the sad part.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.932
When I was 19,

36:25.851 --> 36:30.813
I needed six grand to pay
these guys off I was in trouble with.

36:33.275 --> 36:37.111
So I found a pretty lady with a dumb
husband who had some money.

36:40.782 --> 36:43.951
And I got them to give it to me.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.622
How's that for a tragedy?

36:49.499 --> 36:52.585
I became the man I was hunting.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.255
I became Sawyer.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.183
Don't you feel sorry for me.

37:12.689 --> 37:14.064
Get the hell out.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.151
Get out!

37:49.351 --> 37:52.519
It was like some miracle.
She just showed up with that mixture.

37:52.604 --> 37:56.357
She rubbed it on Shannon's chest
and ten minutes later she was breathing.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.036
Eucalyptus.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.623
Smart, Jack.

38:12.707 --> 38:13.999
Thank you.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.502
Very much.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.819
- What are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.321
You're moving to the caves.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.448
You didn't?

38:46.533 --> 38:48.492
Peanut butter?

38:49.202 --> 38:50.536
No way.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.996
Just like you ordered.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.833
There is one thing.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.086
It's extra smooth.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.547
That's OK.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.933
It's empty.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.769
What?

39:17.272 --> 39:19.440
No, it's not. It's full.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.525
Full to the brim...

39:21.609 --> 39:26.613
...with stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth,

39:26.698 --> 39:31.577
oh, God, it makes you want
a glass of milk, extra smooth...

39:40.295 --> 39:43.630
It's the best bloody peanut butter
I've ever tasted.

39:47.802 --> 39:48.969
You want some?

40:05.570 --> 40:06.779
Sayid?

40:12.869 --> 40:14.495
I can't stay here.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.330
What?

40:16.414 --> 40:18.207
I'm leaving.
I don't know how long.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.292
Sayid, you can't...

40:21.419 --> 40:23.087
We don't know what's out there.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.340
I have worse things to fear
than what's in the jungle.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.843
What I did today,

40:29.928 --> 40:32.221
what I almost did,

40:32.305 --> 40:35.599
I swore to do never again.

40:35.683 --> 40:40.479
If I can't keep that promise,
I have no right to be here.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.273
There's nowhere to go.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.235
Someone has to walk the shore
and map the island.

40:46.319 --> 40:49.154
See what else there is.

40:49.239 --> 40:53.617
I can't think of a better person
to do it than the only one I trust.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.164
I hope we meet again.
