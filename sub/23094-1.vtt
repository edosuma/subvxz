BELT BUCKLE BEING UNDONE

CLOTHES DROP TO THE FLOOR

00:10.960 --> 00:16.000
This programme contains some strong language and some scenes of a sexual nature.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.320
You miss me?

00:36.320 --> 00:37.800
Yeah, I did.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.120
SHE LAUGHS

00:48.040 --> 00:51.240
There's only a few days to go and there's a lot to arrange.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.120
You didn't need to. It's just a few friends.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.000
- And we've got Neil and Anna tonight. 
- It's all under control.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.280
Is this yours?

01:01.280 --> 01:02.800
Yes, actually. Dry lips.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.880
Bit girly.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.760
Red? Nothing wrong with that.

01:05.760 --> 01:07.520
And it was the only one they had.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.080
- Remember you're taking Tom to school. 
- I'm late.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.440
Me, too.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.040
Worth it, though.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.840
Oh, no-one's going to notice. It looks fine.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.480
- What does? 
- No, nothing.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.840
Morning, Mum.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.800
Morning, darling.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.480
You know we're late?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.840
The form for the trip's in your bag.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.360
- Thanks. 
- No problem.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.000
And don't forget your coat.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.320
Oh, yeah. OK.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.920
All ready, mate?

01:35.920 --> 01:37.000
Nearly.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.520
Where's my scarf?

01:38.520 --> 01:39.880
Here, have mine.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.080
Really, no. It's...black.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.360
I'm wearing blue.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.600
I think you'll manage.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.440
- Bye. 
- Bye.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.480
- Dad, did you drive back last night? 
- Yeah. I had meetings.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.640
- What happens in a meeting? 
- What do you mean?

01:55.640 --> 01:58.960
- What do you do? 
- You sit and drink coffee and discuss things.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.560
- See you later! 
- Bye!

02:00.560 --> 02:01.880
Bye, Mum!

02:18.200 --> 02:19.840
'Right, we're on the food, the cake.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.560
'Like, you're doing the decorations.'

02:21.560 --> 02:23.320
'Not a problem. What would you like?'

02:23.320 --> 02:25.640
- Balloons, bunting. 
- 'Oh, absolutely.'

02:25.640 --> 02:27.960
Oh, we talked about putting something behind the bar.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.440
- 'Very generous.' 
- Enough so that they'll have a good time.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.520
Not so much that I'll need a stomach pump.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.920
'You know what Neil's like. I'll speak to the landlord.'

02:35.920 --> 02:38.200
- You're a life-saver. 
- 'We'll catch up tonight.'

02:38.200 --> 02:39.680
Lovely. Speak then, Anna. Bye.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.640
Dr Foster...

02:54.640 --> 02:55.880
Gordon. How are you?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.440
Not good at all.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.360
That's why I'm here. Back pain.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.240
OK, well, we'll deal with that inside.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.200
I was just saying hello, really.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.120
Oh, right. Well, how are you?

03:05.120 --> 03:08.240
Good. Bit of a disaster with the hair this morning, but...

03:08.240 --> 03:09.760
Yes, I can see that.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.400
Good morning, Julie.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
- Not really. 
- What's happened?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.640
Jack's ill. Not coming in.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.120
Oh, why?

03:20.120 --> 03:22.160
That's his final warning.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.240
What did he say?

03:23.240 --> 03:24.800
Gastroenteritis.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.360
I saw him in the pub last night.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.840
- All right. Er, how many on his list this morning? 
- 12.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.880
Julie see what you can do. Take the appointments down to eight minutes.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.720
- OK. 
- Eight minutes is impossible.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.560
Talk faster!

03:35.560 --> 03:37.400
See you later, Luke.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.840
- Not a flicker. 
- He's too young for you.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.920
Maybe.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.280
But I accidentally on purpose

03:43.280 --> 03:45.080
brushed up against his shirt the other day

03:45.080 --> 03:46.840
and he is toned like a bastard.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.480
- You would if you could. 
- Ros!

03:50.480 --> 03:52.160
Shall we make a start?

05:29.880 --> 05:33.960
As you know, I live on my own and once a week my sister comes over.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.760
Bit of a drive for her, but she brings the shopping.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.200
Meals.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.040
Soup, tomatoes, meat, onions...

05:43.040 --> 05:44.200
Yes.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.600
She was there on a Thursday. I had a headache that day,

05:46.600 --> 05:49.040
which isn't the primary reason I'm here.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.400
But now I mention it,

05:52.640 --> 05:54.960
I've had them for years. It's on your notes.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.160
Mm...

05:56.160 --> 05:58.800
Last weekend, I saw a documentary.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.440
They said headaches have historic...

06:00.440 --> 06:03.720
Gordon, can we get back to the specific symptoms

06:03.720 --> 06:05.160
that brought you in?

06:05.160 --> 06:07.360
I lay there with my eyes open all night.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.320
I only get a couple of hours and then I'm falling asleep in the day.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.560
Have you had any recent big changes?

06:12.560 --> 06:13.760
Moving house? New job?

06:13.760 --> 06:14.800
No.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.840
- Do you have a partner? 
- Aren't there pills?

06:16.840 --> 06:20.640
Sleeping pills, yes. But I wouldn't prescribe them in your case.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.120
You wouldn't prescribe sleeping pills for someone who can't sleep?

06:24.120 --> 06:25.840
Only if we've tried everything else

06:25.840 --> 06:27.560
or there's a medical condition

06:27.560 --> 06:28.720
and that's rare.

06:28.720 --> 06:29.840
- You think I'm lying? 
- No.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.760
Yes. Because you're not giving me the pills,

06:31.760 --> 06:34.120
even though they do exist and would help my problem.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.160
I think we should try some other things first.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.400
We're opening a new restaurant tomorrow.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.560
I would love it if you could come so I can say thank you.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.920
Oh, it's fine.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.160
No, no, please!

06:47.160 --> 06:49.240
Look, I'll send through the details.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.240
OK.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.120
So I don't need to do anything?

06:55.120 --> 06:56.440
Keep taking these.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.040
But other than that, no.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.400
Good.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.600
Gemma...

07:05.600 --> 07:07.280
thank you so much.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.760
No problem.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.680
Dr Foster went to Gloucester in the pouring rain.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.320
She stepped in a puddle right up to her middle

07:39.320 --> 07:40.840
and never was seen again!

07:40.840 --> 07:43.200
Well, I hope not!

07:43.200 --> 07:44.720
It's good to see you, Poppy.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.000
- You're very brave. 
- Thanks!

07:47.040 --> 07:48.120
Bye.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.680
- I did my science and Harry checked it, so I know I got it right. 
- Right, is Harry good?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.720
He's a genius. He did his IQ and got 140, which is loads.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.280
Gemma?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.360
Hi! How are you?

07:59.360 --> 08:00.680
Oh, sorry, I don't...

08:00.680 --> 08:02.520
Oh, Becky. Simon's assistant.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.160
Oh, yes.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.480
You didn't recognise me. It's fine. It's been a while.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.240
- Hi, Tom! Haven't seen you in ages. 
- Hi.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.920
So your daughter goes to Highbrook?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.720
Isobel. Yeah, she just started.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.160
Me and her dad broke up middle of last year, so...

08:15.160 --> 08:16.200
Oh, sorry.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.920
Yeah, well, we just thought Isobel might like a new start, so...

08:18.920 --> 08:21.040
Oh, and the homework club is a blessing!

08:21.040 --> 08:23.320
I can do the whole day, finish off, lock up

08:23.320 --> 08:25.680
and be here at 5.30 to pick her up myself.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.240
I'm so sorry I didn't recognise you.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.120
Oh, no! No-one does anymore.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.280
After the split, I wanted a new start, too. So I went blonde.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.760
Mum wasn't happy. Said I looked like Tess Daly, as if that's a bad thing.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.000
But I like it. And Mum's mad, so...

08:39.000 --> 08:40.480
Anyway, I'll see you soon.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.679
- Bye. 
- Bye.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.760
Bye.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.960
OK?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.600
Mum?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.800
- Mum! 
- Yeah!

09:01.760 --> 09:04.200
Do you know how many bones there are in the human foot?

09:04.200 --> 09:05.560
26.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.040
And 33 joints.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.640
And more than 100 muscles, tendons and ligaments.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.120
Mum, you're a geek.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.720
I know.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.400
I was stuck in traffic for 20 minutes

09:16.400 --> 09:18.360
but, bearing in mind I started late today,

09:18.360 --> 09:20.720
I think I've done pretty well. What's more, I have wine.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.000
Perfect.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.480
Can I do anything?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.760
You can pour me a glass.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.680
Oh, before I forget...

09:26.680 --> 09:28.520
Did you cope with the colour?

09:28.520 --> 09:29.960
The colour was fine.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
Mate, you going to come and say hello tonight?

09:31.960 --> 09:33.640
- No. 
- Why not?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.320
Mum said I don't have to.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.080
Oh... You're not a kid anymore.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, but you never let me leave and you tell these stories.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.760
Up to you.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.000
Right.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.560
So...tell me about your weekend.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.560
Er...well, it's a conference.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.480
A load of men gather in a cheap hotel,

09:54.480 --> 09:56.560
talk about planning legislation.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.960
What about the evenings? Do you go out?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.120
Occasionally.

10:01.080 --> 10:04.920
Every night in the casino. Roulette, cocktails, beautiful women...

10:04.920 --> 10:06.720
It's Hemel Hempstead.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.680
What's so fun about casinos?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.320
I mean, in the end, you always lose.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.200
Ah, well, now, let me explain...

10:12.200 --> 10:13.720
No, I don't think you will.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.760
DOORBELL CHIMES

10:14.760 --> 10:16.160
Ah-ha!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.840
OK, see you later, Mum.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.120
- Do you want a juice to take up? 
- No, thanks.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.080
- Hey! Welcome. 
- Hey! Good timing!

10:25.120 --> 10:27.040
- Have you just got in? 
- We saw you pull up.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.480
I had to stop for booze.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.520
- No need! 
- Hello.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.080
Just the kind of thing you feel...

10:32.080 --> 10:34.760
It was a resort. But it, you know, it really wasn't bad.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.720
You know, open the door and you were right there on the beach.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.600
Yeah, and they have activities for children.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.920
I'm sure Tom would love it.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.120
- There's kids everywhere. 
- Screaming!

10:44.120 --> 10:46.080
They were just having fun!

10:46.080 --> 10:47.360
He told them to shut up.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.120
I did not tell them to shut up!

10:50.120 --> 10:52.200
"Pipe down," like an old man!

10:52.200 --> 10:53.720
It's an expression.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.200
You can imagine how popular that made us.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.040
Gem hates feeling trapped, so I'm not sure a resort's really our kind...

11:00.040 --> 11:02.360
It's not me! I'd be fine.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.720
There's no point in us staying near the sea.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.360
You don't like water.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.760
He's even nervous in the shower.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.280
What?

11:09.280 --> 11:11.200
- He can't swim, is the issue. 
- I can.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.960
- Barely. 
- Didn't you learn at school?

11:12.960 --> 11:14.600
I had asthma, so...

11:14.600 --> 11:15.680
Oh.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.240
- Yeah, I grew out of it. 
- I rescued him once.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.440
Jesus, Gem, really? I don't think we have to...

11:20.440 --> 11:22.560
I think we do.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.520
- I must've told you. 
- Don't think so!

11:27.680 --> 11:30.120
Oh, we were on holiday in Greece.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.680
On the beach.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.560
And he goes in for what I can only assume was meant to be a paddle.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.560
Two minutes later, I look over,

11:38.560 --> 11:40.640
realise he's been swept out and he's drowning.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.000
- So I leave our stuff and run to help. 
- Baywatch.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.240
Baywatch, right. Exactly.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.480
Slow motion.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.320
You can stop thinking about it now!

11:49.320 --> 11:51.480
I swim over, get him back to the shore

11:51.480 --> 11:52.920
and he's fine.

11:52.920 --> 11:57.280
But of course, he's coughing and wheezing and playing it up.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.920
It was real, actually.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.320
And very humiliating.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
We'd only been together a month or two.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.480
Three months!

12:03.480 --> 12:05.840
Yeah, right. But here's the thing...

12:05.840 --> 12:08.480
I can hardly breathe. I nearly died.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.240
Nearly died?

12:10.240 --> 12:11.360
Yeah.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.000
But what happened made me realise...

12:15.200 --> 12:16.800
..she was the one.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.240
This is her...

12:23.240 --> 12:25.080
and I never want to let her go.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.960
Clever, funny.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.320
Hot in a bikini.

12:31.320 --> 12:32.880
But also, back then...

12:33.880 --> 12:35.520
..bright red hair.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.680
You didn't!

12:37.680 --> 12:38.920
It was a phase.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.160
That night I proposed.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.320
- Right! So that was...? 
- Yeah.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.320
And for some reason I said yes.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.120
Well, you did well.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.160
You didn't.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.320
- You should learn to swim properly. 
- I'm fine.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.840
Yeah!

12:55.840 --> 12:57.360
I'll teach you.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.600
Arm bands!

12:58.600 --> 12:59.840
Don't bother, mate.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.160
Listen, when I hit 40, I gave up on a whole load of stuff.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.920
Never going to. Don't want to.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.600
So, how are you feeling about your birthday party?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.240
Good, I think.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.400
I'm not being told any details...

13:10.400 --> 13:12.000
I'm in charge of the barbecue, mate,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.520
so that's all you really need to know.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.160
Alert the authorities!

13:16.160 --> 13:17.520
Yeah, yeah...

13:17.520 --> 13:19.640
CONVERSATION FADES

13:41.080 --> 13:42.320
Oh, God!

13:43.720 --> 13:45.000
I didn't see you.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.000
The canapes are my first priority now I'm back.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
So if it's the canapes that were bothering you, it's all fine.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.920
It's not the canapes.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.920
No.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.200
I found a long, blonde hair on Simon's scarf.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.240
- A long, blonde hair? 
- Yeah.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.560
And you think he's been with someone else?

14:07.560 --> 14:08.720
I don't...

14:08.720 --> 14:10.160
A long, blonde woman?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.760
It's... It's paranoia. I know.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.120
Lots of people have blonde hair.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.720
It's just I've never...

14:18.720 --> 14:21.160
I mean, I'm sleeping with Simon. It is probably mine.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.920
I'm joking!

14:25.880 --> 14:28.000
Oh, God, you are worried.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.960
Look, I mean, it doesn't even have to be a woman.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.000
Men can be blond.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.560
Horses?

14:37.560 --> 14:39.720
It's just once you have the thought...

14:42.600 --> 14:44.680
- Do you trust him? 
- Yes.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.240
Yes!

14:48.880 --> 14:50.680
Then trust him.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.560
Otherwise, you'll start checking his phone and his pockets.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.520
You two are fantastic.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.320
The hair is just a hair.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.240
Now, I see what you've done with your wine glass and I approve.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.720
You work too hard.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.280
Wine is good.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.760
Come on...

15:17.120 --> 15:20.360
DINNER PARTY CHATTER IN THE DISTANCE

15:40.480 --> 15:42.560
- Bye, guys. 
- Bye! Thank you!

15:42.560 --> 15:45.000
Come on, trouble, let's be having you.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.760
LAUGHTER

15:47.760 --> 15:49.280
Does it matter?

15:58.440 --> 15:59.840
Oh, fun.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.320
Yeah...

16:10.880 --> 16:12.360
Have I done something?

16:14.120 --> 16:15.280
What?

16:16.280 --> 16:18.880
You're acting like I've done something wrong.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.000
Tired.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.400
Love you.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.120
You go up. I'll make tea.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.160
- I've got lip salve. 
- Yeah, I know.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.920
And what else? A blonde hair and nothing on his phone. That's it?

17:46.920 --> 17:49.680
Of course there's nothing. I shouldn't have even looked, but...

17:49.680 --> 17:51.760
his assistant went blonde recently.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.160
- So you're saying... 
- Yeah, they're either definitely sleeping together

17:56.160 --> 17:58.560
or she once hung up his scarf. I...

17:58.560 --> 18:00.320
This is not like you.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.400
Simon's never home until half seven.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.080
He says that's when he finishes work.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.600
OK...

18:06.600 --> 18:09.200
But I met his assistant at the school gate

18:09.200 --> 18:13.520
and she said she locks up the office at five to pick up her daughter.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.960
So what is he doing in those two-and-a-half hours?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.200
He's not with her if she's picking up her daughter.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.520
Yeah, I know.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.760
Then I thought it could be Anna.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.680
I know.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.200
It's...

18:28.200 --> 18:29.720
It's just a feeling.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.200
Are you drinking more coffee than usual?

18:33.200 --> 18:34.800
No.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.680
You're acting like you're drinking more coffee than you should.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.760
I'm sorry.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.880
I'm fine.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.240
- Crisis over. 
- Good.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.200
I Googled rashes.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.440
And as you can see, skin irritations can look very different,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.400
but none of them anything like what I've got.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.440
I only gave you the cream yesterday.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.440
- It doesn't work. 
- Well, you're supposed to allow a week.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.800
OK, but if it's going to have an effect in a week,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.400
I should see some improvement by now and there's nothing.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.320
I've also stopped using the washing powder, as you advised,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.440
but there's no evidence so far from that...

19:15.440 --> 19:16.640
Ah...

19:20.680 --> 19:23.680
You'll have to leave. I'm afraid I'm not feeling very well.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.880
But you're a doctor.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.400
Ironic.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.320
What is it? What's wrong with you?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.920
I'm running a temperature and I feel quite sick and ...

19:34.400 --> 19:36.760
To be honest, I've got a suspicion that, whatever it is,

19:36.760 --> 19:38.600
it's probably contagious.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.360
I've got to head off. Problem with Tom at school.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.120
I'll catch up on paperwork at home.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.400
Can you call the last few and reallocate or put them off?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.800
No problem.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.640
Oh, are you leaving? I wanted to see you.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.640
- It's urgent. 
- Then you need to call first thing.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.800
The not-sleeping is medical. I've got back pain.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.440
Tried paracetamol?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.960
I have, but I need something stronger.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.480
How about a benzodiazepine?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.800
That sound like the right sort of thing?

20:14.800 --> 20:16.880
I don't know. Erm...yeah.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.080
- What's the... 
- It's a muscle relaxant.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.040
It's essentially a sleeping pill.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.440
You didn't mention this back pain yesterday, Carly.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.400
I think you've been on the internet.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.800
Why do you really need the pills?

20:28.800 --> 20:30.120
I can't...

20:30.120 --> 20:31.560
sleep.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.600
You can tell me anything at all. You know that.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.680
Sometimes you just need to talk.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.840
OK?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.240
Book an appointment when you're ready to trust me.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.680
- 'Hello?' 
- Anna, it's me. Hi.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.920
- 'Hey...' 
- Look, I don't know if you're around or...

20:56.920 --> 20:58.360
what you're doing at the moment,

20:58.360 --> 21:00.960
but Tom needs picking up from school. I'm stuck at work.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.560
'You mean this afternoon?'

21:02.560 --> 21:04.320
- Yeah. 
- 'I'm sure I can.'

21:04.320 --> 21:05.960
'What time, exactly?'

21:05.960 --> 21:07.040
Er, half past.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.480
- 'Just outside the front?' 
- Yeah.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.680
- 'No problem. I'll take him to mine.' 
- You're a star.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.880
- 'I'll see you later.' 
- Yeah.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.840
- 'Bye.' 
- Bye, then. Bye.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.600
BANGING ON CAR WINDOW

21:59.320 --> 22:00.560
You want me gone.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.960
I'm not getting into it now.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.000
Why not?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.240
Because...

22:04.240 --> 22:06.400
Because we're talking through a car window.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.000
Look, we're due to have a meeting...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.360
I saved someone's life last night in the pub.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.080
This young man was in pain.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.520
I examined him.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.120
He had appendicitis.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.560
He's alive because of me.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.160
Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.000
I'm still a doctor.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.120
Shit...!

22:27.920 --> 22:29.040
What?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.040
Gemma!

22:32.360 --> 22:33.440
Gemma!

23:19.280 --> 23:20.440
Oh...!

23:25.120 --> 23:26.320
OK, no.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.160
For Janet?

23:29.160 --> 23:31.000
Hi, Helen.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.880
- I didn't know you were here. 
- Just arrived.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.040
All right?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.560
Yeah, absolutely.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.840
How are you?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.040
Not a good night, was it, Mum?

23:43.040 --> 23:45.920
I'll speak to Dr Barton and maybe we can make you more comfortable.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.560
Thanks.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.400
I'm sorry, Helen. I don't mean to be rude.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.640
But would you just give us a minute?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.880
I need to check something.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.960
I must be in trouble.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.280
- Shouldn't you be picking up Tom? 
- Anna's doing it.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.560
Why? What's the matter?

24:06.560 --> 24:07.840
Oh...

24:07.840 --> 24:10.640
The thing is you don't get home till half seven

24:10.640 --> 24:12.960
and Becky says that she locks up at five.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.320
So I couldn't work out

24:14.320 --> 24:16.600
what you were doing for two-and-half hours each day.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.040
What I was doing?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.720
So I followed you.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.880
I come here. That's what I do.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.440
Every day?

24:26.440 --> 24:28.520
Most days at the moment, yeah.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.480
Last couple of months, she's worse, so...

24:30.480 --> 24:32.080
Why didn't you tell me?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.600
It's not a secret.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.120
- Yeah, but you never mentioned it. 
- OK.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.360
I'm sorry.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.800
You followed me?

24:45.680 --> 24:47.400
What did you think I was doing?

24:50.640 --> 24:52.640
- Is everything all right? 
- I just got worried.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.640
I...

24:55.640 --> 24:57.480
It doesn't matter. We should...

25:03.360 --> 25:06.320
- All sorted out? 
- Yeah, absolutely. I've got to head off.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.840
- All right. 
- Got to pick Tom up.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.440
Are you all right?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.840
Does everyone have to sign in and out here?

25:47.840 --> 25:49.040
Absolutely.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.840
Fire regulation. We got pulled up on it last year.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.200
- You done it? 
- Yep.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.240
Yes.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.280
I'm...

25:57.280 --> 25:58.600
Thanks.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.840
Oh, nightmare!

26:25.880 --> 26:27.320
He's such an idiot.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.720
Thanks, Dennis.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.120
Sorry.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.920
DOOR OPENS

27:58.960 --> 28:00.400
Oh... Hi.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.600
Hi.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.080
I was looking for, erm, Simon's schedule.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.680
I couldn't find it anywhere.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.040
Sorry.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.000
Is...this his bag?

28:13.320 --> 28:15.000
It's mine.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.560
Yours?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.400
Sorry...

28:24.040 --> 28:25.960
I only came back because I left some notes.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.760
Dennis let me in.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.320
I pick up Isobel and Simon...

28:30.320 --> 28:32.640
Well, he's normally gone by five, so...

28:32.640 --> 28:35.240
To be honest, that's what I was counting on.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.800
We haven't been away in ages as a family and...

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
..I thought I could book a surprise holiday,

28:41.000 --> 28:42.960
but I need his schedule to know when he's free.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.560
So that's why I'm sneaking around.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.880
I didn't want him to find out.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.280
That's really nice.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.680
Well...

28:50.680 --> 28:52.520
Well, I'll tell you what. I'll go through

28:52.520 --> 28:55.160
and e-mail you some weeks that might work. Is that OK?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.240
Perfect.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.760
Just saves you going through the whole thing.

28:58.760 --> 29:01.160
And I assume you'd rather I didn't mention it?

29:02.200 --> 29:03.400
Is that OK?

29:05.240 --> 29:07.560
I'd love to open a restaurant one day.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.800
We'd serve just two things, but do them really well, like...

29:12.400 --> 29:14.120
..lamb and carrots.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.840
Dad, that's a really bad idea.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.520
- Why? 
- Well, what if you didn't like lamb or carrots?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.240
Well, then you don't come.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.040
- What's this place called? 
- Ciao.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.560
And it's owned by a patient?

29:23.560 --> 29:25.360
Yes, er, Susie Parks.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.200
She's nice and I didn't think I could...

29:27.200 --> 29:28.680
Susie Parks?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.520
Yeah.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.000
Her husband is Chris Parks?

29:32.960 --> 29:34.640
Yes. Yes, I think so.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.120
Erm, Chris Parks, he's...

29:36.120 --> 29:39.360
I've told you about him. He's given me advice, helped me out.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.600
Right, well, this is their new place, opening tonight.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.200
Amazing!

29:48.880 --> 29:50.160
I'm sorry.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.480
What for?

29:58.560 --> 30:00.400
I know I'm, er...

30:00.400 --> 30:02.520
working long hours at the moment, away a lot,

30:02.520 --> 30:05.760
but I really appreciate you supporting me.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.840
And once this project's up and running, I promise,

30:08.840 --> 30:10.000
it'll be worth it.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.560
Are you coming?!

30:12.560 --> 30:14.040
Don't worry about it.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.560
Come on, we're late.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.560
Hey! Hey!

30:20.560 --> 30:22.160
We only just made the connection!

30:22.160 --> 30:24.360
Me, too! I mean, Foster and Foster.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.680
I really should've worked that one out.

30:26.680 --> 30:30.000
Ah, Gemma, this is my husband Chris.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.400
Chris this is THE Dr Foster.

30:32.400 --> 30:35.480
- Susie's told me everything you've done. Thank you so much. 
- Oh, well...

30:35.480 --> 30:37.280
This is Ros Mahendra, my colleague.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.160
Oh, yes, I've seen you a couple of times.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.600
- And Tom. 
- Hi.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.440
Make sure you stay for pudding. Chocolate cake's to die for!

30:43.440 --> 30:45.120
Did you make it yourself, Susie?

30:45.120 --> 30:47.400
Well, you know, I might've helped with the recipe...

30:47.400 --> 30:49.320
You've worked wonders with this place.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.240
Yeah, well, we want that family feel.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.960
Obviously it's not our first one - we've got five of these now -

30:53.960 --> 30:56.200
but, you know, it's where we live, it's our home,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.720
so it's important it has that personal touch.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.120
I mean, we're all mucking in.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.800
I'm working out front, Susie's keeping an eye on the kitchen.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.760
As best as I can!

31:04.760 --> 31:07.560
And this is our youngest, Andrew, who's serving food.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.360
And Kate's about somewhere.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.120
Er, Kate!

31:11.120 --> 31:12.440
Child labour.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.960
I thoroughly approve!

31:13.960 --> 31:15.320
Absolutely!

31:15.320 --> 31:18.000
You should all come tomorrow, so we can return the favour.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.080
Tomorrow?

31:19.080 --> 31:21.400
Simon's 40th. Tomorrow evening at The Artichoke.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.720
You're 40?

31:22.720 --> 31:23.880
Unfortunately.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.040
Well, we'd love to!

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
Absolutely. Why not? We'll be there.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.160
Anyway, listen, I got to, er...

31:29.160 --> 31:31.760
- Have a great evening. I'll see you. 
- So good to see you.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.520
Thanks, Susie. You, too.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.600
- I love this place. 
- You're a sweetheart.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.720
Bye.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.040
This used to be a pub.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.960
And it was nasty.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.440
- What was it? The Honey... 
- The Beehive.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.760
The Beehive!

31:50.960 --> 31:53.720
That was the only place you could get served if you were underage.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.640
The landlord didn't care.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.280
Excuse me.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.040
Hey!

32:13.720 --> 32:15.160
Are you all right?

32:16.640 --> 32:18.240
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.080
What's all this?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.600
Er, new restaurant.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.320
You work at The Crown?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.480
Yeah.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.640
You look stressed, mate.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.800
Want one?

32:33.800 --> 32:35.360
No, haven't for years.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.800
- Used to, though? 
- My husband helped me stop.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.440
Won't kill you.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.680
- Not entirely true. 
- Yeah, I know.

32:42.680 --> 32:45.120
MEN SHOUT DRUNKENLY

32:45.120 --> 32:46.720
That's Daniel.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.080
My boyfriend.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.680
He's got a new job.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.080
Celebrating.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.760
And, yes, he's a twat.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.360
Not a bad one, as they go.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.320
Are you all right?

33:07.960 --> 33:09.840
Sometimes you just need to talk.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.400
I'm pretty sure my husband is sleeping with someone else.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.720
Oh... Why? Have you seen him out with her?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.840
- No. 
- Well, found e-mails or whatever?

33:22.840 --> 33:24.000
No.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.520
Only because you better be sure before you say something.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.280
My mate Bromley threw her boyfriend out because he lied about where he was one afternoon.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.800
Only thing was, he was shopping for her birthday present.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.560
Two weeks later, they split up.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.240
Couldn't trust each other after that.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.440
Are you going back in?

33:42.440 --> 33:43.480
Yeah.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.120
Then you'll want one of these.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.760
And some of this.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.840
Oh, God...

33:57.640 --> 33:59.080
Thanks.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.560
No worries.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.040
- Where the fuck have you been? 
- On my break!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.000
Not with me. I'm right here.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.560
Yeah, I need to work now, so...

34:09.560 --> 34:11.960
- We'll have the same again. 
- Tell me at the bar!

34:17.080 --> 34:18.400
Goodnight, mate.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.639
Night.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.920
Hey, sleep well.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.560
Already asleep.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.120
Dream good, then.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.760
Love you, Tom.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.400
Love you, too.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.760
What?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.120
Nothing.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.720
'Is it my love?

35:57.240 --> 35:59.240
'Ask again that question.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.480
'Speak again in that soft voice.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.920
'And look again with wishes in thy eyes.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.640
'Oh, no.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.200
'Thou can'st not.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.760
'Can'st thou forgive me, then?

36:22.480 --> 36:25.960
'Wilt thou believe so kindly of my fault, to call it madness?

36:28.000 --> 36:31.040
'Oh, give that madness yet a milder name.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.960
'And call it passion.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.760
'Then be still more kind

36:37.760 --> 36:39.360
'and call that passion...

36:40.600 --> 36:41.840
'..love.'

36:46.840 --> 36:48.240
KNOCKING ON DOOR

36:50.520 --> 36:51.840
Is everything OK?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.040
Yes, erm...

36:53.040 --> 36:54.600
It's nothing to worry about.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.800
I know we called, said it was urgent, but...

36:58.080 --> 37:00.800
..it's because I wanted to speak to you this morning.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.600
No, I meant you. Your eyes are red.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.880
Are you still having difficulty sleeping?

37:08.880 --> 37:10.200
Yeah.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.200
Well, I'm going to give you the pills that you've asked for.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.320
- Only a few. See if it helps. 
- Oh...

37:15.320 --> 37:18.120
But I...need something in return.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.160
A favour.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.360
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

38:29.120 --> 38:30.840
PATIENT CLEARS HIS THROAT

38:30.840 --> 38:32.200
Er, I'm sorry...

38:38.840 --> 38:40.440
MOBILE BEEPS

38:44.200 --> 38:45.840
I assume you'll lead?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.200
Sure.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.040
Are you OK?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.200
Yeah.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.760
Jack, come in, please.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.360
Would you take a seat?

39:02.720 --> 39:04.440
Enjoying this?

39:04.440 --> 39:06.240
Of course not.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.880
Why do you need three of you?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.560
We're the partners in the practice. It's standard procedure.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.200
Who makes the decisions?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.640
- We all do. 
- But who do I talk to?

39:15.640 --> 39:17.560
Jack, you know full well,

39:17.560 --> 39:19.280
I'm senior partner.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.120
I've been a family doctor 35 years.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.360
I am respected in this town.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.600
Of course...

39:28.600 --> 39:31.400
And I have seen this place change from a practice

39:31.400 --> 39:34.800
where the doctors knew the patients and had time to look after them,

39:34.800 --> 39:36.840
to an institution

39:36.840 --> 39:40.480
where it's just about efficiency, management.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.080
We are supposed to work to the maxim, "first, do no harm."

39:44.080 --> 39:47.560
Well, let me tell you, harm has most certainly been done!

39:47.560 --> 39:49.600
- Can I interrupt? 
- No! You wait.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.800
I have a question.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.800
- I've told you, I'm going to speak. 
- Have you been drinking today?

39:53.800 --> 39:56.000
- What? 
- Because I can smell it.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.640
Well...

39:57.640 --> 39:59.200
don't see why I shouldn't.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.640
I'm not at work.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.960
Look, the fact is I disagree with the way things are run.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.200
No.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.720
- What? 
- You don't disagree with the way things are run.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.080
You disagree with me.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.760
You're offended because I'm a 37-year-old woman,

40:11.760 --> 40:14.320
not from round here, good at my job

40:14.320 --> 40:16.240
and when our former senior partner retired,

40:16.240 --> 40:18.200
he chose me rather than you to take over.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.360
- Shall we stick to the procedure? 
- You don't like me.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.760
That's right.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.560
But it's not because you're a woman

40:23.560 --> 40:25.400
or from somewhere else.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.920
When you arrived, I was...

40:26.920 --> 40:29.240
I was happy to give you a chance.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.760
But I've gone off you, Gemma, because it's all gone to your head.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.640
You think you're so clever.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.160
We have to let you go.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.320
- No shit? 
- You've had three formal warnings.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
I'll tell you what happens to arrogant people.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.960
- You are suspended immediately, pending... 
- They end up alone!

40:44.960 --> 40:46.480
All right, let's just calm down.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.600
Yes, it's all right. I've got the idea.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.040
Jack...

40:50.040 --> 40:51.840
JACK SLAMS THE DOOR

40:54.440 --> 40:56.000
Never seen you like that.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.480
MOBILE PHONE BUZZES

41:03.440 --> 41:04.840
Excuse me.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.040
Yes?

41:06.040 --> 41:08.320
He was in there half an hour with the curtains closed.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.320
I...

41:11.480 --> 41:13.800
'And now they've both come out. He's saying goodbye.'

41:13.800 --> 41:15.640
Get a picture.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.440
I'm too far away. They're...

41:17.440 --> 41:19.360
They're kissing.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.880
'Are you still there?'

41:28.880 --> 41:30.280
What does she look like?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.960
'Your height. Blonde.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.000
'She's getting in her car. He's gone to his.'

41:35.000 --> 41:36.240
How old?

41:36.240 --> 41:38.080
I can't see.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.760
- 'Take a picture.' 
- I can't.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.400
You can! Take a picture.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.040
- Take a picture of anything. 
- OK. OK. OK.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.440
I'm going to do the minutes now.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.720
- I wasn't sure if we'd finished. 
- Yes, I think so.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.080
OK.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.280
Yes?

42:14.280 --> 42:15.720
'It was all I could get.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.720
'Sorry. Looks like you were right.'

42:21.680 --> 42:23.440
You want to know who it is?

42:25.240 --> 42:26.440
What?

42:27.400 --> 42:29.000
I can find out.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.320
You go inside, love. I...

42:44.320 --> 42:46.200
I just need to speak to my friend.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.120
And don't forget the cake. It's on the table.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.640
Well?

42:56.640 --> 42:57.960
I've got a mate down the pub.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.480
He's a desk sergeant, so he can do the number plate.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.720
Erm...

43:02.720 --> 43:04.080
Susan...

43:05.120 --> 43:06.360
..Parks.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.000
What?

43:15.320 --> 43:16.720
You know who that is?

43:22.480 --> 43:24.800
What are you going to do?

43:24.800 --> 43:26.240
It doesn't make sense...

43:35.800 --> 43:38.880
- Here... Seven, for now. See how you go. 
- Yeah, thanks.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.920
I assume that he wakes you up?

43:45.960 --> 43:47.800
Look, I come back from work

43:47.800 --> 43:51.600
and every night he is rowdy and up until the early morning.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.640
If I can get in and go straight to sleep...

43:56.120 --> 43:58.520
- ..it makes it easier. 
- You don't have to stay with him.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.240
Yeah, I know.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.160
Carly...

44:04.400 --> 44:05.440
..show me.

44:16.640 --> 44:17.920
Did he do this?

44:18.880 --> 44:21.160
- Carly? 
- Last night. Yeah.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.680
He just... He won't leave me alone.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.400
No, wait! I need that!

44:31.320 --> 44:32.640
Where is he?

44:40.800 --> 44:42.680
I thought we were going to the party.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.520
- I need to do something first. 
- We'll be late!

44:44.520 --> 44:46.640
Can't be helped. Number 7?

44:48.960 --> 44:51.360
- What are you going to do? 
- Have a word.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.120
You don't know him.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.280
It's your house. You want him to leave?

44:56.800 --> 44:58.760
Right, then.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.640
MOBILE PHONE BUZZES

45:07.680 --> 45:09.520
What's his full name?

45:09.520 --> 45:11.120
Daniel Spencer.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.680
Any problems, drive away. Take Tom, call the police.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.520
I'll be back in a minute.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.560
Mum!

45:16.560 --> 45:17.760
What are you doing?

45:17.760 --> 45:19.040
House call.

45:20.680 --> 45:23.480
SHOOTING AND SHOUTING FROM TV GAME

45:24.920 --> 45:26.840
DOORBELL RINGS

45:33.040 --> 45:34.760
- Daniel Spencer? 
- Who are you?

45:34.760 --> 45:36.880
- I'm your doctor. 
- No, you're not.

45:36.880 --> 45:40.360
I'm the senior partner, so I have overall responsibility.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.240
Could I come in?

45:45.040 --> 45:47.360
Is this normal, doctors calling round randomly?

45:47.360 --> 45:49.480
Not at all. Perhaps you'd like to sit down?

45:49.480 --> 45:51.320
- Why? 
- I think you should.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.280
You know what medical records are?

45:57.600 --> 46:00.520
- What? 
- We record every conversation that you have with your doctor

46:00.520 --> 46:01.800
and it stays on file.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
They can be extremely revealing.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.560
How's the new job?

46:05.560 --> 46:07.000
Responsibility?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.400
What are you talking about?

46:08.400 --> 46:10.720
Occasionally, these records get leaked

46:10.720 --> 46:13.760
and the wrong people get their hands on them.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.760
Employers, for instance.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.480
And they're full of the sorts of things

46:17.480 --> 46:19.400
that you wouldn't want people knowing.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.400
History of drug use,

46:21.400 --> 46:23.080
mental instability...

46:24.520 --> 46:26.280
I'm having one of these, OK?

46:27.640 --> 46:30.960
- Who are you? 
- I'm Dr Gemma Foster, head of Parminster Medical Practice.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.360
Just let me finish.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.000
I've seen Carly's arm.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.400
- Accident. 
- It's a very deep bruise.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.920
- You're going to leave and get out of her house. 
- None of your fucking business!

46:51.520 --> 46:52.920
You should get help.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.280
Come and see me, if you like. That's up to you.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.880
But if, once you've left, you go near her,

46:58.880 --> 47:00.640
if she even sees you again,

47:00.640 --> 47:03.480
your employers will receive a copy of your medical records...

47:04.800 --> 47:07.400
..and if they don't contain anything compromising already,

47:07.400 --> 47:10.120
I will ensure that they are altered.

47:10.120 --> 47:13.520
Drug problems, injuries suggesting a history of violence.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.720
I'll go to the police and I'll mention what I saw on your girlfriend's arm

47:16.720 --> 47:19.160
and this new career of yours will stop very suddenly.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.240
They won't believe you.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.200
I'm a doctor with ten years' experience.

47:23.200 --> 47:25.040
I'm a senior manager, a school governor

47:25.040 --> 47:26.480
and in this town, Daniel,

47:26.480 --> 47:29.200
people take me at my word.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.480
You fucking bitch!

47:30.480 --> 47:32.160
Argh!

47:32.160 --> 47:34.360
You think it's OK to call women words like that?

47:37.080 --> 47:39.000
It is not.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.160
Daniel...

47:51.360 --> 47:53.400
..she'll send your things. Leave now.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.640
He'll come back.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.080
Doubt it.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.960
If he does, give me a call. I'll set the police on him.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.560
- About the other thing. Your thing. 
- What?

48:15.080 --> 48:18.280
You said you looked everywhere and never found anything.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.640
Well, when I saw...

48:21.000 --> 48:22.920
What I saw earlier...

48:24.120 --> 48:26.240
..he kept on going to his boot in the car.

48:26.240 --> 48:29.440
So, maybe, if you want to know what's been going on, look there.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.640
Here, love, give it to me.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.360
Excuse me.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.120
Where've you been? What?

49:02.400 --> 49:05.120
- What? 
- Could you give this to Anna.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.400
Right. Sorry. I just thought you'd be here.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.800
Have you got the keys to your car? I'm missing an earring.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.200
- What? Why do you need... 
- I've searched everywhere else.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.920
You look fine.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.800
I know it's in there. I need it.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.280
OK. Just...

49:18.240 --> 49:19.640
..come quickly, yeah?

49:30.160 --> 49:32.240
Here we are. Everyone, out.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.520
Right, come on. Come on, everyone.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.320
Best behaviour, please.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.640
Right, daughter, too. Shall we?

49:44.400 --> 49:45.840
Susie, hi.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.960
SHE SIGHS DEEPLY

50:59.720 --> 51:01.080
Oh...!

51:27.360 --> 51:28.680
Hey!

53:05.680 --> 53:08.040
Hey!

53:08.040 --> 53:09.480
Where have you been?

53:18.600 --> 53:19.880
You all right?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.400
Shit!

53:24.400 --> 53:25.880
Ow!

53:33.280 --> 53:34.520
Ow!

53:34.520 --> 53:36.080
I'm an idiot. Sorry.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.960
I'm going to have to take this off.

53:42.960 --> 53:44.560
Ow...!

53:44.560 --> 53:45.600
Ah!

54:03.120 --> 54:04.240
There.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.920
Maybe I'll leave the food to Neil.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.840
You all right?

54:13.760 --> 54:15.720
Mate, if you've finished in the sick bay,

54:15.720 --> 54:17.840
we need your attention over here for two seconds.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.600
Come on, best smile!

54:19.600 --> 54:21.560
CHEERING

54:23.360 --> 54:24.800
Thanks, guys!

54:24.800 --> 54:25.840
Wow!

54:28.600 --> 54:30.440
ALL: Ooooh...!

54:30.440 --> 54:31.840
ALL: Yay!

54:31.840 --> 54:34.400
APPLAUSE

54:35.560 --> 54:37.080
Speech!

54:41.000 --> 54:42.400
40! Jesus!

54:43.360 --> 54:44.600
Er...

54:44.600 --> 54:46.920
I would say thanks for coming, but there's free booze,

54:46.920 --> 54:48.280
so I know why you're here.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.880
Especially you!

54:49.880 --> 54:51.040
Erm...

54:51.040 --> 54:53.320
I'm not really into speeches but...

54:54.280 --> 54:56.400
..I have to thank two people.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.720
I at least want to do that.

54:57.720 --> 54:58.880
Erm...

54:58.880 --> 55:00.080
Firstly, Tom.

55:01.400 --> 55:04.840
He's smart, he's well-behaved,

55:04.840 --> 55:06.240
most of the time...

55:07.960 --> 55:11.280
..but better than that, and he won't like me saying this, but...

55:12.240 --> 55:13.720
..he's kind.

55:14.800 --> 55:17.000
He always wants people to be happy

55:17.000 --> 55:18.880
and he does his best to make that happen.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.000
Sorry, Tom. I'm embarrassing you, I know, but...

55:23.000 --> 55:25.360
..I'm really so proud to be your dad.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.640
Ah...

55:26.640 --> 55:28.520
And the other person...

55:28.520 --> 55:31.040
You'll know that I've lived most of my life here,

55:31.040 --> 55:34.160
apart from five years in London,

55:34.160 --> 55:35.360
which I hated!

55:35.360 --> 55:37.760
But even so, I'm glad I went because in London...

55:38.920 --> 55:40.480
..I found Gemma.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.600
And since then, I've never looked back.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.960
I'd be nothing without her. She's...

55:48.000 --> 55:50.080
..a wonderful mother,

55:50.080 --> 55:52.000
a talented doctor

55:52.000 --> 55:54.480
and not a bad little earner!

55:54.480 --> 55:55.960
Erm...

55:55.960 --> 55:58.240
All my dreams, what I want,

55:58.240 --> 56:00.280
she never laughs,

56:00.280 --> 56:02.280
she just asks how she can help.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.720
And in return, she's stuck with a middle-aged man.

56:06.720 --> 56:08.040
So...

56:08.040 --> 56:09.480
in sympathy and...

56:10.680 --> 56:14.200
..admiration, please, be upstanding for a toast

56:14.200 --> 56:15.640
to Gemma!

56:15.640 --> 56:17.360
- ALL: 
- To Gemma!

56:17.360 --> 56:20.160
Come on, Gemma. Speech!

56:20.160 --> 56:21.840
Speech!

56:50.120 --> 56:52.480
Right, let's get this party started!

56:56.960 --> 56:58.200
'Hell...

56:59.200 --> 57:00.520
'Hell...

57:00.520 --> 57:01.920
'Yet I'll be calm.

57:02.960 --> 57:04.720
'Now the dawn begins...

57:06.600 --> 57:10.200
'..and the slow hand of fate is stretched to draw the veil

57:10.200 --> 57:11.760
'and leave thee bare.

57:14.640 --> 57:18.160
'Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turn'd...

57:20.120 --> 57:22.680
'Nor hell a fury

57:22.680 --> 57:25.000
'like the woman scorned.'

57:41.680 --> 57:43.200
How long have you known?

57:43.200 --> 57:44.680
Oh, God, Gemma...

57:44.680 --> 57:46.160
Yeah.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.440
I want him to come in and see those suitcases

57:50.440 --> 57:53.120
and understand, in that second,

57:53.120 --> 57:55.080
exactly what he's lost.
