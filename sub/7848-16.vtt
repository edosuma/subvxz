20:06.600 --> 20:09.400
BUT WAS TOO LAME
TO DO IT HIMSELF

20:09.400 --> 20:13.133
BECAUSE HE HAS
LOUSY HAND-EYE
COORDINATION.

20:13.133 --> 20:18.233
I HAVE ASTIGMATISM.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.400
LOOK, DON'T YOU
ALL REMEMBER

20:20.400 --> 20:23.467
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO
GO TO YOUR FIRST
BASEBALL GAME,

20:23.467 --> 20:25.033
TO WALK THROUGH
THAT DARK TUNNEL

20:25.033 --> 20:28.400
AND SUDDENLY SEE
THE STADIUM OPEN UP
IN FRONT OF YOU?

20:28.400 --> 20:28.934
YEAH.
YEAH.

20:28.934 --> 20:32.900
SMELLING THE NEWLY-CUT
GRASS AND THE FRESH,
ROASTED PEANUTS.

20:32.900 --> 20:33.600
YEAH.
YEAH.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.767
THE FAT FAN'S
NACHO BURPS.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.734
[ALL GROAN]

20:39.100 --> 20:39.867
THE POINT IS,

20:39.867 --> 20:42.400
THIS MAN DIDN'T THINK
HE'D LIKE BASEBALL,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.133
BUT ONCE HE GOT THERE,
HE LOVED IT.

20:44.133 --> 20:48.400
SO HE GOT SWEPT AWAY
IN THE EXCITEMENT
AND CAUGHT THE BALL.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.600
HE DID IT FOR ME.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.200
HE MAY BE THE MOST
HATED MAN IN BOSTON,

20:52.200 --> 20:54.400
BUT TO ME,
HE'S A HERO.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.367
AW!
AW!

20:56.367 --> 20:58.500
YOU KNOW, THE KID'S
GOT A POINT.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.467
YEAH.
YEAH.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.900
AND ISN'T THAT WHAT
BASEBALL'S ALL ABOUT?

21:01.900 --> 21:04.867
NOT WINNING OR LOSING
BUT THE LOVE OF THE GAME?

21:04.867 --> 21:05.834
YEAH.

21:05.834 --> 21:12.367
NOT IF YOU LOST
YOUR PAYCHECK BETTING
ON THE SOX.

21:12.367 --> 21:13.500
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.867
AND IT KNOCKED US
OUT OF FIRST PLACE.

21:15.867 --> 21:17.100
BEHIND THE YANKEES.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.934
I HATE THE YANKEES.

21:18.934 --> 21:21.767
I HATE HIM!

21:21.767 --> 21:23.500
GET HIM!
YEAH!

21:23.500 --> 21:26.100
RUN, BOYS, RUN!

21:27.500 --> 21:32.100
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU CATCH HIM!

21:37.667 --> 21:38.300
AS I MAY HAVE MENTIONED

21:38.300 --> 21:41.200
EVERY 5 MINUTES FOR
THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF--
BUT WHO'S COUNTING?--

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
IT'S CLOSING TIME.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.467
ISN'T IT JUST
A GORGEOUS NIGHT?

21:45.467 --> 21:48.200
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.467
FINE. IF YOU WANT
TO STAY, I HAVE
ONE FAVOR TO ASK.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.300
WE'VE RUN OUT OF STEEL
WOOL IN THE KITCHEN.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.400
WE'D LOVE TO
SCRUB THE POTS OUT
WITH YOUR HAIR!
