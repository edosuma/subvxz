WEBVTT

00:01.589 --> 00:02.670
Mom, I'm ready.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.740
Great. Okay, Coop, hurry it up!

00:04.740 --> 00:05.870
You got everything, chicken?

00:05.870 --> 00:07.420
- Backpack, sweater... 
- Lunch.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.590
Looking forward to your
first day back at school?

00:09.590 --> 00:10.940
As much as you're looking forward
to your first day back at work.

00:10.940 --> 00:14.010
Well, we all have our burdens to bear.

00:14.010 --> 00:17.040
Come on, Coop. Here he
is... the little man.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.940
Ooh, did I tell you two how
happy I am to have you home?

00:20.940 --> 00:22.540
- Like a thousand times. 
- A lot.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.070
Well, make it a thousand and one.

00:24.070 --> 00:26.580
You wanna call us at lunch
so you can tell us again?

00:26.580 --> 00:27.810
I might forget.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.130
Come on, you two. Let's get you out
the door. I am picking you up, OK?

00:30.130 --> 00:32.130
Bye bye. I love you!

00:32.130 --> 00:34.130
I love you. Good Luck!

00:46.900 --> 00:49.720
God, you looked so sexy making lunches.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.890
Come in.

00:53.010 --> 00:54.300
When are you going
to tell them about us?

00:54.300 --> 00:55.450
Soon, I promise.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.120
You know, the kids have
just had a lot going on,

00:57.120 --> 00:59.400
with back to school,
and Kitty being sick.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.850
I know you French
are very laissez-faire

01:01.850 --> 01:03.200
about these things,

01:03.510 --> 01:06.150
but we American girls
are a little more uptight.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.820
All right. I'll be patient.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.020
Thank you. Mm.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.200
How's it going over at mom's?

01:13.200 --> 01:15.510
Nora is a wonderful woman.
There's not doubt about that.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.830
I just didn't come all the way here

01:17.830 --> 01:21.290
to stay at her guest room, but...

01:21.320 --> 01:23.360
You're making me feel terrible.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.380
Oh, dear. It's 20 to 8:00.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.650
I'm gonna be late for work.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.650
But you're the boss. You
can be a little bit late.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.980
No, I can't. I gotta get back to work.

01:29.980 --> 01:32.010
I've been awol for weeks.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.080
Here.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.550
- What's this? 
- Uh, just lunch.

01:36.550 --> 01:38.320
Um, I mean, you take care of everyone.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.210
So you need someone to take care of you.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.360
Oh, my god.

01:43.530 --> 01:44.230
You made this?

01:44.230 --> 01:46.330
I'm French, so... croque-monsieur.

01:46.330 --> 01:48.310
Come here. Oh.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.870
I think I'm gonna be very late for work.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.290
It's all meaningless...

01:55.570 --> 01:57.660
worthless reams of paper...

01:57.660 --> 02:00.310
That's what's left of my life savings.

02:00.310 --> 02:02.500
Oh, come on, Holly. You
heard the investigator.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.370
I mean, they still
think there's a chance

02:04.370 --> 02:06.050
you're gonna recover some of it.

02:06.050 --> 02:08.970
Yeah, an unlikely chance.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.000
And have you considered
selling your stake in Ojai?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.610
You know, David, I really... I
can't talk about this right now.

02:15.610 --> 02:16.910
I have got to get these files

02:16.910 --> 02:18.620
over to the investigators in an hour,

02:18.620 --> 02:20.800
and then I gotta get ready for
my meeting with Sarah tomorrow.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.800
I'm just saying, it's worth considering.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.810
Do you think that I
haven't considered it?

02:24.810 --> 02:27.500
It's all I've been thinking about.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.730
But Ojai isn't worth
that much right now,

02:30.730 --> 02:34.000
which is why I have to get
this company back on its feet.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.600
And you think that this,
um... cheap wine blend idea...

02:37.600 --> 02:38.830
you think that'll do it?

02:38.830 --> 02:42.800
If Sarah will get on board, yes.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.400
- On the bright side... 
- Hmm?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.520
I don't just love you for your money.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.550
I can't believe they make you
fill out this much paperwork

02:51.550 --> 02:53.460
for an ultrasound.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.950
Oh, my god... Ultrasound.

02:54.950 --> 02:56.950
Wasn't that the name of
a club we used to go to?

02:56.950 --> 02:58.340
No, it was Megawatt.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.440
Oh. Remember how cheap the drinks were?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.180
Man, I used to get so wasted.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.860
Um, Michelle, I hope
you're gonna be okay

03:05.860 --> 03:08.870
not partying like a rock
star for the next nine months.

03:08.870 --> 03:12.160
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can totally
use a break from all that stuff.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.310
Can you define "stuff"?

03:14.310 --> 03:16.350
- Kevin. 
- What? I think it's a reasonable question.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.490
I can't remember if my grandmother died

03:18.490 --> 03:21.600
of a stroke or a heart attack.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.600
You have history of a stroke and...
or a heart disease in your family?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.480
All right, Kevin. That's enough.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.850
Maybe you should take Kevin to Megawatt.

03:27.850 --> 03:30.550
It looks like someone could use a drink.

03:30.550 --> 03:33.000
I'm glad you find our future baby's
potential heart disease so funny.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.650
Michelle's the surrogate,
not the egg donor.

03:34.650 --> 03:36.290
Her DNA isn't involved.

03:36.290 --> 03:39.490
- Looks like that pretty much covers it. 
- Yay.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.690
- Time to get my oven checked. 
- All right, promise to call me as soon as you're done.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.480
- I will. Bye. 
- Bye.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.010
All right. Mwah. Oh!

03:50.530 --> 03:52.000
Break an egg.

03:53.850 --> 03:54.850
What is wrong with you?

03:54.850 --> 03:56.850
Look, I'm sorry. I know she's your friend. I
don't think we should be cavalier about this.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.630
No one's being cavalier.

03:58.630 --> 04:01.290
And she's not just a friend.
She's a very close friend.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.990
You know, one of the benefits
of going through this process

04:02.990 --> 04:03.800
with a very close friend

04:03.800 --> 04:06.620
is it doesn't have to
be cold and impersonal.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.420
- Please stop worrying. 
- Okay. Okay.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.790
What time does Megawatt open?

04:42.620 --> 04:43.040
Aah!

04:43.040 --> 04:44.440
Oh! God, mom!

04:44.440 --> 04:45.560
God! You scared me!

04:45.560 --> 04:47.500
I thought I heard something outside.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
I wanted to make sure
the door was locked.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.370
No, no, no. I think... I
think I heard something inside.

04:50.370 --> 04:53.710
- Really? Shh. Let's... let's listen. 
-  Yeah. Okay. Shh.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.290
It's the phone.

04:57.290 --> 05:00.350
- I'm gonna answer it. Of course I'm gonna answer it. 
- You answer it. Who is it?

05:00.350 --> 05:02.660
- Hello? Yes, this is Nora Walker. 
- Who is it?

05:02.660 --> 05:04.840
- It's the security people. I don't remember the password. 
- Oh, the password, the password.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.350
It's Sparky or Bingo...
one of our dead dogs.

05:06.350 --> 05:07.350
Dingo! Dingo!

05:07.350 --> 05:09.660
Dingo! That's it. Dingo. What?

05:09.660 --> 05:11.660
Really? What should we
do? Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:11.660 --> 05:13.440
Oh, my god. What? What?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.710
Evidently something's
triggered our silent alarm.

05:15.710 --> 05:16.670
- They're sending the police. 
- Oh, my god.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.670
Tell me I shouldn't be scared.
I should be scared? Why?

05:18.670 --> 05:19.860
Oh, my god. No, you should be scared.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.000
Mom, we have to go get
Evan. What? What? What?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.350
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:22.350 --> 05:25.360
- It's Luc. 
- Yes, it's Luc... Luc! It's Luc! It's, uh...

05:25.360 --> 05:29.760
Who? No, I'm sorry. No, no.
I heard a noise. I'm sorry.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.710
Oh!

05:30.710 --> 05:32.800
- It's in the kitchen. 
- No, Luc. No, no, no, Luc, don't go.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.930
- Shh! Shh! Shh. 
- Luc, don't go. Don't do it.

05:35.930 --> 05:38.010
I bet you're rethinking your
position on gun control now,

05:38.010 --> 05:38.600
aren't you, mother?

05:38.600 --> 05:46.250
- Oh, no. No, don't. 
- Don't. Shh. I have an idea. Give me that. Give me that.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.050
Wait for my signal, and
then come in screaming.

05:49.050 --> 05:50.040
Oh, god. Shh.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.870
Oh, god. We're gonna be killed.

05:55.570 --> 05:57.950
Now! Lights! Turn on the lights!

05:57.950 --> 06:02.750
Aah! Aah! Aah! I got the broom!
I got him! I got him! I got him!

06:02.750 --> 06:04.880
- Mom! Mom! Mom! 
- The police are coming! Get him! Get him, mom! Get him!

06:04.880 --> 06:08.480
- Mom! 
- Wait. He said "mom".

06:09.080 --> 06:10.710
Tommy!

06:10.710 --> 06:14.300
- What are you doing here? 
- Hi. I came to see you.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.140
Oh, my god. How are you?

06:15.140 --> 06:18.970
- I'm good. How are you? 
- A little bit sore, but...

06:18.970 --> 06:21.160
Fine. Hi. Mom.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.470
Hi, Tommy.

06:22.470 --> 06:25.240
Why is there a half-naked
foreign guy in your kitchen?

06:25.240 --> 06:27.990
Oh, that's Luc. This is... this
is Tommy. It's a long story.

06:27.990 --> 06:29.720
- Sarah. 
- Oh. Hey.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.560
- Hi. Sorry. 
- Right.

06:31.560 --> 06:36.120
- Oh, Tommy! I'm so glad to see you! 
- Hi, mom.

06:37.620 --> 06:38.620
Tommy!

06:43.390 --> 06:45.080
So that's it. It's quick and easy,

06:45.080 --> 06:46.760
and we should see a profit in no time.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.010
I'm still trying to get my
head around the fact that

06:49.010 --> 06:51.450
you bought this much surplus
juice without consulting me.

06:51.450 --> 06:54.500
Well, I had to. You did
not return my phone calls.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.440
So either I get behind your idea
or we sell the juice at a loss.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.000
I don't appreciate you trying to
force my hand like this, Holly.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.060
I am copresident of this company,

07:02.060 --> 07:04.620
and I want Ojai to
succeed as much as you do.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.540
Holly, you just bet
the discretionary fund

07:06.540 --> 07:07.880
on an enormous gamble.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.290
We can't just sit around doing nothing

07:09.290 --> 07:12.120
and praying that the
economy will change.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.500
This is a good plan.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.590
It's Kitty. I gotta take this.

07:17.590 --> 07:21.000
Well, look at the research
and keep an open mind.

07:21.810 --> 07:23.490
I'll try.

07:23.490 --> 07:24.930
Hey, you. What's up?

07:24.930 --> 07:27.120
We had an intruder last night.

07:27.120 --> 07:27.730
Really?

07:27.730 --> 07:29.990
Dark hair, medium build,

07:29.990 --> 07:32.980
currently resides in a
new age commune in Mexico.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.380
Oh, my god. Tommy's back?

07:34.380 --> 07:36.390
He looks skinny, Kevin.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.440
God, Tommy, don't they
feed you down there?

07:38.440 --> 07:40.550
Who goes to Mexico and
comes back looking skinny?

07:40.550 --> 07:41.870
- I'm not skinny, mom. 
- It must be all that yoga.

07:41.870 --> 07:43.000
Remember the summer I spent in Oaxaca?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.350
I came back looking like I'd
eaten an entire Backstreet Boys.

07:45.350 --> 07:47.350
Oh, I hope it wasn't Nick
Carter. He's my favorite.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.630
- Tommy's back. 
- Yeah. Shut up.

07:49.630 --> 07:52.370
Oh. Hey.

07:52.370 --> 07:54.950
- Who's that? 
- Oh, Kitty, it's Justin. Justin, are you sitting down?

07:54.950 --> 07:57.820
- Why? What, did Frenchie get you pregnant? 
- What? Sarah's pregnant?

07:57.820 --> 08:00.840
No, I'm not pregnant! Tommy's back.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.040
No, she's not pregnant.
Tommy's... Wait, Tommy Tommy?

08:03.040 --> 08:06.410
- Tommy Tommy. And I'm staring at him right now. 
- Yeah, and it's kinda creeping me out.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.120
That's so great! That's so g...

08:08.120 --> 08:10.570
Oh! I got a, um, I got a
study group all morning.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.960
- Tell him he sucks. 
- Uh, Justin says you suck.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.220
That's nice, Justin. Did you hear that?

08:15.220 --> 08:17.050
I'm wearing two different
color socks today.

08:17.050 --> 08:20.560
- Can you believe that? I've never done that before. 
- Cute. Tommy's back.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.490
Tommy's home! That's fantastic!

08:22.490 --> 08:24.540
Uh, mom, did you tell
him about our surrogacy?

08:24.540 --> 08:26.590
Well, no, I think you
should tell him that.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.420
- Okay, let me talk to him. 
- Can he stop by later?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.980
Uh, Saul wants to know if
Tommy can stop by later.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.549
Uh, Saul wants to know
if you could stop by Ojai.

08:33.549 --> 08:35.960
Maybe he can help us get out of this
crazy wine scheme of Holly's. Tell him.

08:35.960 --> 08:36.960
You know what?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.220
This is exhausting. And I have
to take Evan to the doctor.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.980
- Can you just talk to Saul? 
- Here. Kevin wants to talk to you.

08:40.980 --> 08:45.250
- This would be a lot easier in person. 
- Okay, me first. How long are you here?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.320
Uh, I thought, I don't
know, I'd hang for a while

08:47.320 --> 08:48.530
- for Kitty, you know. 
- Great.

08:48.530 --> 08:50.930
Well, how is she, seriously?

08:52.580 --> 08:53.870
Um, well, you know, she's Kitty.

08:53.870 --> 08:55.830
She's not gonna let
it get the best of her.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.830
Sounds like Kitty.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.820
- I, uh, I met your boyfriend. 
- He's not my boyfriend.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.760
- Oh, no? What is he then? 
- Oh, he's not?

09:01.760 --> 09:02.870
I don't know what he is,

09:02.870 --> 09:04.670
- but whatever he is, I'm enjoying it. 
- We heard.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.440
Okay, here you go. Dig in. Ooh!

09:07.660 --> 09:12.870
- I'm okay, mom. Thanks. 
- You look good. You're, uh, mellow.

09:13.520 --> 09:13.920
Yeah, I don't know.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.820
I guess the vegan food
and the meditation,

09:15.820 --> 09:19.620
- it helps me... stay centered. 
- That's ridiculous.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.140
We all know the key to health
and happiness is doughnuts.

09:22.920 --> 09:23.720
What?

09:23.720 --> 09:27.200
So I hear you and Scotty are
doing the whole surrogacy thing.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.360
Whoops. Kinda slipped out.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.610
- Sort of. 
- Well, congratulations.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.290
Thank you. Well, don't jinx it yet.

09:33.290 --> 09:34.410
Our potential surrogate

09:34.410 --> 09:36.540
- is getting her lady parts checked out today. 
- What?

09:36.540 --> 09:38.540
- "lady parts"? 
- "lady parts."

09:38.540 --> 09:42.310
- It's... Kevin, it's a uterus. It's a uterus. 
- Yes, I know, I know! I know. I know, I know.

09:42.310 --> 09:45.080
- How's Elizabeth and... and Julia? 
- Yeah.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.660
- They're... they're good. Julia sends her love. 
- Aw.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.110
Have they been down there to visit you?

09:50.110 --> 09:53.250
Uh, no, not yet. You
know, Julia's in Seattle,

09:53.250 --> 09:55.840
And... and... and... and...
and Elizabeth's in preschool.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.020
- She's in preschool already? 
- Oh, yeah. Time flies by.

09:59.020 --> 10:00.350
Have you seen her?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.500
No, but I, uh, I talk to her
every day. You should hear her.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.580
I mean, she... she's putting
together full sentences.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.660
Oh, I want to hear her voice.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.860
I wish Julia would
return my phone calls.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.860
She just needs space, mom. I
think she just needed some...

10:11.860 --> 10:12.770
Does she return your phone calls?

10:12.770 --> 10:14.730
Hey. So... What about Dr. Walker?

10:14.730 --> 10:15.940
Yeah. Mm.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.370
Uh, I'm not putting
together full sentences.

10:18.370 --> 10:21.360
Um, no, I'm good. I just,
uh, I'm a little exhausted

10:21.360 --> 10:23.720
from wedding planning and
school and all that stuff.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.240
Well, if anybody can handle it, you can.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.030
That's it. You're just...
you're just gonna be nice?

10:30.890 --> 10:32.520
I'm proud of you.

10:33.160 --> 10:33.950
Wow.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.080
All right, I, uh, I actually have to go.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.130
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:36.130 --> 10:38.170
I'm... I'm already late for
my study group, and, uh...

10:38.170 --> 10:41.280
besides, Zen Tommy is
freaking me out a little bit.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.430
Up is down, black is white.

10:42.430 --> 10:44.070
Yeah, doofuses are becoming doctors.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.760
- There you are. 
- All righty.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.570
I love you.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.840
- Mmm. All right, buddy. 
- See ya. I gotta go though.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.770
Uh, let's have a family dinner tonight,

10:52.770 --> 10:57.840
- if it's all right with Tommy. 
- Uh, yeah. That's... that's great.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.830
- Great. 
- Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.

10:58.830 --> 11:00.130
Okay, you be back. You be back.

11:00.130 --> 11:03.300
I'll bring the kids
over, mom, at 4:00, okay?

11:07.320 --> 11:11.210
I'm gonna make your
mommy a great big salad.

11:11.210 --> 11:11.940
Mom, you know,

11:11.940 --> 11:13.560
you really don't have to do that.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.130
I promised Robert I would get
you to eat while he's in D.C.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.500
Wow! Daddy's in D.C.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.560
And then a pork roast for dinner

11:20.810 --> 11:22.900
because it's your
uncle Tommy's favorite.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.650
I don't know. After
months of vegan eating,

11:24.650 --> 11:27.310
- I'm not sure that's gonna go over so well. 
- Oh, I forgot.

11:27.310 --> 11:29.890
Well, I'll have to
rethink the whole thing.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.690
But he... he seems
good, don't you think?

11:33.690 --> 11:35.890
- Yeah, I do. 
- Yeah.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.110
It must be hard for him,

11:37.110 --> 11:39.840
being so far away from
Julia and Elizabeth.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.400
Yeah, I think it probably is hard.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.110
- But I, you know, I think they're working it out. 
- Yeah.

11:44.690 --> 11:47.690
I wish Julia would
return my phone calls.

11:47.690 --> 11:50.750
Mom, you're the mother-in-law.
It comes with the territory.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.960
Yeah. Well, maybe I can get
Tommy to give her a little nudge.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Give who a nudge?

11:53.960 --> 11:56.130
Julia. Mom thinks that
she's dodging her calls.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.840
No, I just...

11:57.840 --> 12:00.310
You know, I would love to
talk to her, just touch base.

12:00.310 --> 12:03.290
Julia's got her hands full
with work and Elizabeth.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.660
Plus, it's weird, you being
the mother-in-law and...

12:05.660 --> 12:07.890
All right, listen. Dinner tonight...

12:07.890 --> 12:11.160
Am I going to have to improvise
some vegan extravaganza or...

12:11.160 --> 12:13.160
I have an idea. Why don't I cook?

12:13.160 --> 12:14.130
Tommy, you just got home.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.970
- I... I can make a mole that will knock your socks off. All right? 
- Mole?

12:17.970 --> 12:19.250
Can I borrow the car?

12:19.250 --> 12:21.110
I'm gonna go to the
market, get some stuff.

12:21.110 --> 12:22.680
All right. Okay.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.220
- Do you want some company? 
- Yes. I'll meet you in the car.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.630
All right. Great. Mom,
do you mind taking over?

12:27.630 --> 12:29.010
No. No, please, not at all.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.800
Evan, have fun with
grandma. Okay. Be a good boy.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.860
- There we go. 
- Ooh! See you later.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.780
You know, some people
think it's the coriander

12:38.780 --> 12:39.920
that makes a great mole.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.990
It's actually the Mexican chocolate.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.850
I can't even believe that "coriander"

12:43.850 --> 12:45.240
is coming out of your mouth.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.650
Ah! Throw in some of these
for a little extra kick.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.480
I just got my taste buds back.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.290
And I have this feeling

12:52.290 --> 12:55.230
that you're going to...
to burn them off again.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.490
How are you holding up?

12:58.490 --> 13:01.150
Good. Good, it's amazing.
Everybody's been amazing...

13:01.150 --> 13:04.040
I mean, Robert, Sarah,
and... and, you know, mom.

13:04.750 --> 13:08.340
Yeah, look, I'm, uh... I'm
sorry you're going through this.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.170
I feel awful that I
haven't been here for you.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.150
Well, you're here now.

13:13.830 --> 13:17.340
- That's all that matters. And you're making mole, no less. 
- Yeah.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.750
So how does it feel to be back?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.370
It feels a little bit weird.

13:22.370 --> 13:25.720
Yeah. Oh, tomatoes, tomatoes. Thanks.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.920
You know, when I first,
um, came back from...

13:29.630 --> 13:30.460
New York,

13:30.460 --> 13:32.270
it was... it was weird.

13:32.270 --> 13:36.440
I don't know. I just...
I felt, um... different.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.400
Really? You seemed...
you seemed the same to me.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.190
Yeah, well, it was just
all kind of disorienting.

13:41.190 --> 13:42.610
You know, everybody was the same.

13:42.610 --> 13:45.320
And I felt different.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.470
But, you know, it just...

13:46.470 --> 13:48.630
Everything got normal after a while.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.960
- You ready? 
- Let's do this.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.200
So... How is he?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.950
Good. Great. Mom's beyond thrilled.

13:57.950 --> 14:00.720
- What about you? Is there any residual weirdness? 
- Actually, it's okay.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.200
I hate to admit it,

14:02.200 --> 14:05.740
but I think the Hippie Hacienda
was exactly what Tommy needed.

14:05.740 --> 14:08.470
I am the womb master.

14:08.470 --> 14:10.990
- Clean bill of health? 
- Straight A's for the first time in my life.

14:10.990 --> 14:13.240
- Oh! God.  - Yeah, it's great.
 - Oh, my god. This is amazing.

14:13.870 --> 14:17.120
So now all we have to do
is find an egg donor and...

14:17.120 --> 14:20.240
- And get me knocked up. 
- Well, before we get you knocked up,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.700
maybe we should take a
look at the paperwork.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.750
- What paperwork? 
- Paperwork?

14:23.750 --> 14:25.880
Yeah, I had a contract drawn
up. It... it just outlines

14:25.880 --> 14:27.880
both parties' responsibilities
and obligations.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.110
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

14:30.110 --> 14:32.150
Because I only just got
it. It's pretty standard.

14:32.150 --> 14:33.690
I have gone from being
your friend Michelle

14:33.690 --> 14:35.690
to being a "gestational carrier"?

14:35.690 --> 14:37.740
No, no, you're still
our friend Michelle.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.440
Kevin's just being
annoyingly lawyer-ish.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.650
"Travel restrictions."

14:40.650 --> 14:42.830
Does this mean that I can't
visit my family on Christmas?

14:42.830 --> 14:44.830
No, of course you can visit
your family at Christmas.

14:44.830 --> 14:46.810
Well, that would have to
be determined by a doctor.

14:46.810 --> 14:49.180
But some of the details
in there are negotiable.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.040
Michelle, please, don't
take this personally. Okay?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.500
We just have to protect ourselves.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.500
From me? You have to
protect yourself from me?

14:54.500 --> 14:57.110
- No, he doesn't mean that. 
- No, it also protects you.

14:57.110 --> 14:59.860
Think of it this way... what
if, um, you had the baby,

14:59.860 --> 15:01.130
and we decided not to pay?

15:01.130 --> 15:02.780
We would never do
anything like that, Kevin.

15:02.780 --> 15:03.560
Neither would Michelle.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.130
I've known her longer
than I've known you.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.870
Even so, we would be crazy to enter into
this without a contractual agreement.

15:07.870 --> 15:09.870
I thought we wanted to avoid all
the cold and impersonal parts.

15:09.870 --> 15:12.130
Um, obviously, you guys
have some talking to do.

15:12.130 --> 15:14.350
No, Michelle.

15:14.350 --> 15:17.730
- I'm... I'm sorry, Scotty, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. 
- Michelle, w...

15:17.730 --> 15:19.600
I'll talk to you later.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.980
This is your way of
protecting us, a contract?

15:24.980 --> 15:25.720
I'm sorry, if she's not mature enough

15:25.720 --> 15:27.310
to see the need for a contract,

15:27.310 --> 15:30.380
she is not mature
enough to carry our baby.

15:37.790 --> 15:40.270
- Tommy? 
- Look, I know it doesn't look like I know what I'm doing.

15:40.270 --> 15:43.160
But trust me, you are gonna love this.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.710
I finally got Julia on the phone.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.190
She says you're getting a divorce.

15:48.190 --> 15:50.190
Why didn't you tell me?

15:50.190 --> 15:51.210
Don't worry about it, mom.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.270
Don't worry about it?

15:52.270 --> 15:53.270
Can we not talk about this right now?

15:53.270 --> 15:55.920
She says she doesn't want
you in Elizabeth's life,

15:55.920 --> 15:58.810
that you haven't seen or spoken
to your daughter in months.

15:58.810 --> 16:01.180
- Is that true? 
- What, are you checking up on me, Mom?

16:01.180 --> 16:04.360
I... I wanted to surprise you,
fly them down here for the weekend.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.910
- I had no idea. 
- Yeah, well, now you know. So... Can we drop it?

16:09.260 --> 16:11.190
Tommy, you have to talk to her.

16:11.190 --> 16:13.420
I know she's angry, but
you can't let this happen.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.560
We'll get Kevin to help.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.390
I'm sure he knows the name
of a good family lawyer.

16:16.390 --> 16:20.590
- Elizabeth is your daughter you have... 
- Hey! This is my life.

16:20.590 --> 16:21.660
This isn't just my room

16:21.660 --> 16:23.790
you can clean up while
I'm away at school.

16:24.630 --> 16:27.310
This is my mess. You
can't fix this, okay?

16:27.310 --> 16:29.160
- Tommy, I just think... 
- Mom!

16:29.160 --> 16:30.410
I don't want you weighing in on this,

16:30.410 --> 16:33.140
and I don't want the family
weighing in on this either.

16:33.770 --> 16:35.590
Do you know why I didn't tell you?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.840
Because it's none of
your business. It's mine.

16:39.380 --> 16:40.750
And I'd...

16:40.750 --> 16:43.130
I'd appreciate it if
you kept it that way.

16:51.670 --> 16:54.230
Whoa. What's going on in here?

16:54.370 --> 16:57.200
I... I just... I've... I've
never seen you in an apron before.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.220
It's, uh, you look kind of attractive.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.550
Well, wait till you try my
mole. You'll want to marry me.

17:01.550 --> 17:04.089
- Your mole? 
- Tommy, welcome home.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.589
- Hey! 
- Good to see you.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.380
You, too. I hope you guys
brought your appetite.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.700
- Are you kidding me? I'm starving. 
- Holy mole, this looks like something

17:10.700 --> 17:13.130
- I pulled out my cadaver yesterday. 
- Justin!

17:13.130 --> 17:14.609
Well, I'm kidding. You know I'm kidding.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.660
Where's the uh, you
know, Tommy comeback?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.410
No comeback tonight, my friend.

17:18.410 --> 17:20.910
I'm just, uh, happy we're all together.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.930
Show time. Come on, let's eat.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.089
Hmm. Wow, no comeback?

17:27.089 --> 17:31.100
He's grown up. You
should try it sometime.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.880
Stay in here and keep
the door locked, okay?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.230
Should I take that personally or...

17:35.230 --> 17:38.280
Oh, Luc, I'm sorry. It's
the kids. You know...

17:39.820 --> 17:42.100
I'll make it up to you later, I promise.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.990
Mm.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.990
It's time to eat.

17:54.110 --> 17:56.070
Oh, God, no.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.920
- Ah. All right. 
- Sorry, everybody. Did we start?

17:57.920 --> 17:59.700
- Ooh, la la, mademoiselle! Ooh, la la! 
- Shh.

17:59.700 --> 18:04.680
- Nice of you to join us, Sarah. Oui, oui! Oui, oui! 
- All right, attention.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.740
In honor of Tommy's
return, I have poured

18:06.740 --> 18:08.350
a gorgeous white burgundy.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.150
Tommy, I know you
prefer californian wines,

18:10.150 --> 18:12.700
but this is really
marvelous. I brought a case.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.920
- Ooh, Saul's in the mood to party. 
- No, no, I can't party. I have to go back to Ojai.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.410
- One or two glasses. 
- Bummer.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.790
Yes, Justin, truer
words were never spoken.

18:20.790 --> 18:23.600
A little more articulate,
maybe. But truer? No.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.750
- Okay, I think that a toast is in order. 
- Absolutely.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.430
Yes, definitely. Mom, would
you like to say something?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.610
No. Someone else go. That's okay.

18:35.220 --> 18:36.480
Aw.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.910
Um... O-okay. Okay.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.640
Well, uh, here's to Tommy.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.390
We are very, very happy you're home.

18:44.390 --> 18:48.330
- I whole heartedly concur. 
- Oh, let the record show counsel whole heartedly concurs.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.570
- Would you please give it a rest? 
- Mm.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.750
So, Nora, how about the
mole? Is it up to snuff?

18:55.450 --> 18:57.060
It's fabulous. Very well done, Tommy.

18:57.060 --> 18:59.370
Very good. Thanks, Mom.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.390
So, uh, Scotty, I hear, uh,
you guys are gonna be parents.

19:03.390 --> 19:05.620
- That's exciting. 
- Um, actually,

19:05.620 --> 19:07.740
it looks like things might've
fallen apart in litigation.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.880
- Oh, for crying out loud. It was just a contract, okay? 
- Oh, no! Really?

19:10.880 --> 19:13.230
We signed one when they had
Elizabeth, and we're brothers.

19:13.230 --> 19:14.850
Okay? I was just trying
to protect our family.

19:14.850 --> 19:18.750
- It's what being a good parent's all about, right, Tommy? 
- Yeah.

19:18.750 --> 19:22.020
That's what a good parent does.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.610
- Nora? 
- Yes?

19:24.610 --> 19:26.640
Are you okay? You've
been very quiet tonight.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.440
No, I'm fine. I'm
fine. Totally fine. I...

19:30.100 --> 19:30.970
I just don't want to butt in

19:30.970 --> 19:33.000
where's it's none of my business.

19:34.930 --> 19:36.290
Uh, what are you talking about, Mom?

19:36.290 --> 19:38.590
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

19:38.590 --> 19:41.040
It's Tommy's life. Let him
clean up his own damn room.

19:41.040 --> 19:45.380
- Mm. All right. Tell us what she's talking about. 
- Yeah.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.530
Thanks, Mom.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.400
Uh, Julia and I are getting divorced.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.050
Oh, god, I'm sorry. What?

19:59.050 --> 20:01.250
- I... I thought maybe... 
- Go ahead. You might as well tell them the rest.

20:01.250 --> 20:06.110
- No, no. Hey, you brought it up. 
- I did not. Okay, fine, fine.

20:06.110 --> 20:09.600
He has not seen or talked
to his daughter in months.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.230
And Julia does not want him
in Elizabeth's life anymore.

20:14.230 --> 20:15.800
- Okay, Mom, could you just... 
- Thank you. Tommy...

20:15.800 --> 20:19.840
- Paige, Cooper, you wanna go in the living room maybe? 
- But I don't want to miss the fight.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.240
Oh, uh, come on, kiddo. We'll
go play some video games.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.730
Is it true?

20:29.770 --> 20:32.010
Yeah. You are unstoppable, Mom.

20:32.150 --> 20:33.580
Well... Yes. Tommy, you
should've said something.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.200
Well, I... you have not spoken
to Elizabeth since you left?

20:36.320 --> 20:39.590
- No, he hasn't. 
- Stop it, please.

20:39.710 --> 20:40.930
Julia's right.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.870
I lost the house, I lost
the savings, everything,

20:42.970 --> 20:45.480
because of something that I did.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.010
Now she's doing something
that she needs to do.

20:47.110 --> 20:50.480
I don't blame her for that.
So just... Just lay off.

20:50.570 --> 20:53.630
No, I won't. Elizabeth
is my granddaughter.

20:53.630 --> 20:55.510
I'm gonna fight to have
a relationship with her.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.310
- I'm not gonna just walk away. 
- What do you wanna be, grandmother of the century?

20:59.420 --> 21:03.810
Well... nothing is hard for you,
right, Mom? Everything is just perfect.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.340
Well, guess what.

21:05.420 --> 21:06.540
We're not all like you.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.090
- Guys, come on. 
- No! Stop it.

21:09.170 --> 21:11.310
I mean, these... these
expectations you set...

21:11.390 --> 21:14.040
How is anybody supposed to reach them?

21:14.130 --> 21:17.100
Look, I... I tried,
but it was never enough.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.350
So you know what? I'm... I'm done.

21:19.430 --> 21:21.080
I... I... I let go of
trying to please you

21:21.160 --> 21:25.150
a long time ago, Mom.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.450
This family...

21:27.570 --> 21:28.920
It never changes.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.380
No, Tommy.

21:29.380 --> 21:32.090
No, I'm suffocating.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.370
I can't wait to get the hell out of here

21:34.490 --> 21:40.520
and go somewhere where
I can breathe again.

22:03.520 --> 22:07.090
You okay?

22:07.190 --> 22:11.100
No. I'm not okay.

22:11.320 --> 22:14.930
He hates me.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.320
No. No, mom, he...

22:18.430 --> 22:19.360
He doesn't hate you.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.820
He's just, I don't know, he's
just working something out.

22:22.910 --> 22:24.490
He hates me.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.590
And when did he get like this?

22:26.710 --> 22:29.630
I mean, you were always the
one that would come at me.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.210
And the other kids,
things would come up,

22:31.330 --> 22:32.310
and they'd get them out.

22:32.410 --> 22:36.430
But not Tommy. Tommy
was my easiest child.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.770
He would get up in the morning
and he would deliver his papers,

22:39.880 --> 22:42.680
and then he would go on the
weekends and work at Ojai.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.230
I could always count
on Tommy to do the...

22:46.380 --> 22:51.710
To... to do... to do what?

22:54.050 --> 22:56.120
I was gonna say "to do the right thing."

22:56.270 --> 22:58.730
Hmm.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.870
Oh, god.

23:04.730 --> 23:08.950
Maybe he was so easy
because I needed him to be.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.580
I had four other kids,

23:10.680 --> 23:11.840
and there was no room

23:12.030 --> 23:15.830
for him to be anything
other than perfect.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.690
And he was.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.560
And he was so close with his dad.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.900
I think somewhere along
the line I just thought,

23:25.020 --> 23:29.270
fine, take him, and
I gave him to William.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.480
I fought for the rest of you.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.030
I fought with you and for you,

23:34.180 --> 23:38.860
but...

23:39.340 --> 23:42.030
but Tommy, I...

23:42.440 --> 23:45.860
Tommy I just gave away,

23:46.010 --> 23:49.800
just like he's giving Elizabeth away.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.090
I think you should talk to him.

23:51.240 --> 23:56.770
I don't know what to say to
him. I don't know what to say.

23:57.450 --> 23:58.750
Well, I'm...

23:58.900 --> 24:02.030
I'm sure you'll think
of... of something.

24:02.180 --> 24:08.390
I... I just think that you guys
need to... to work this out.

24:08.810 --> 24:14.410
I need to go to bed. That's what I need.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.040
- What the hell do you think you're doing? 
- I... I, uh...

24:24.140 --> 24:25.170
Does Holly have any idea
that you're in her office?

24:25.170 --> 24:27.170
This isn't what it looks
like, okay? I can explain.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.060
Do you have any idea what
a breach of trust this is?

24:29.200 --> 24:31.810
- Tell me, have you been going through my office, too? 
- No! No. Okay, listen,

24:31.950 --> 24:33.800
Holly's been taking a lot
of off-the-books meetings,

24:33.930 --> 24:35.280
and... and I heard
her tell her secretary

24:35.390 --> 24:38.580
not to tell you or Sarah.
And I just, I guess I thought

24:38.690 --> 24:42.480
that maybe I... maybe I could find
something and... and... and help

24:42.590 --> 24:44.250
before she did something
to hurt the company

24:44.470 --> 24:50.700
or... or hurt you, I don't know.

24:51.670 --> 24:54.150
Oh, boy.

24:54.150 --> 24:54.800
Look, Ryan,

24:54.800 --> 24:56.120
I appreciate your trying to help me,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.200
but this is not the way
to go about doing it.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.930
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

25:00.050 --> 25:02.440
And... and I understand
if you need to fire me.

25:02.570 --> 25:04.290
No, I'm not gonna fire you.

25:04.290 --> 25:06.260
I like you, I think you're
doing a good job here,

25:06.400 --> 25:09.520
- but I have to be able to trust you. 
- And you can, I swear.

25:09.630 --> 25:11.030
So if anything like this comes up again,

25:11.150 --> 25:12.710
you have to come to me and talk to me.

25:12.830 --> 25:15.150
- Do you understand that? No more amateur detective. 
- Okay.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.350
- Okay? 
- Okay.

25:16.450 --> 25:18.550
- All right, now go. Just get out of here. 
- Thank you, Saul.

25:18.700 --> 25:23.660
Just go. Go on, go.
And think about this.

25:24.150 --> 25:27.550
Honey, can I talk to you about Luc?

25:27.690 --> 25:29.700
I'm sorry that you
walked in on us like that.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.510
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

25:32.640 --> 25:34.740
Well, he is a friend,

25:34.900 --> 25:37.400
and yes, he's a boy.

25:37.500 --> 25:38.940
I met him in France,

25:39.090 --> 25:43.720
and after I got back, he
decided to come see me.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.550
I thought it was weird that
there was a random French guy

25:46.650 --> 25:49.640
staying at grandma's house.

25:49.770 --> 25:51.690
But...

25:51.840 --> 25:54.030
why isn't he staying here?

25:54.140 --> 25:55.220
You know...

25:55.360 --> 25:57.050
We just met, you know.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.050
He's...

25:59.190 --> 26:01.380
But you like him, right?

26:01.560 --> 26:03.760
Yeah, I do.

26:03.940 --> 26:07.400
Well, then why didn't you have
him stay in the guest room?

26:07.590 --> 26:09.670
Would that be appropriate?

26:09.860 --> 26:12.960
- Would you be okay with that? 
- Yeah.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.900
What about Coop? You think he'd
mind a random Frenchman around?

26:16.050 --> 26:20.260
Coop thinks anyone with an
accent is trademark magnifique.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.060
Okay, then.

26:23.200 --> 26:27.560
Maybe he will come
stay for a little bit.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.860
Now is there anything
else we should talk about?

26:30.000 --> 26:33.400
- Uh, not unless you want to help me with my math. 
- Oh, yeah.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.710
How are you?

26:38.710 --> 26:42.030
* I grew up on the bay *

26:42.680 --> 26:47.770
I need this shoulder.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.650
It's hard to believe...

26:50.830 --> 26:54.050
ten years of marriage, and
this is what it comes to...

26:54.210 --> 26:57.810
Julia forbidding Tommy
to talk to his daughter.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.330
It's pretty bad.

27:00.510 --> 27:02.190
It's very bad.

27:02.190 --> 27:06.910
* Time brought me here
like a fishing boat *

27:07.180 --> 27:08.390
Kevin, I'm so sorry

27:08.500 --> 27:10.710
I gave you a hard time
about the contract.

27:10.710 --> 27:13.760
* It was a good life *

27:14.430 --> 27:16.280
I shouldn't have sprung
it on her like that.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.550
True.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.520
But you were right.

27:22.670 --> 27:25.630
The law barely
recognizes us as a family.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.430
You were right to want to protect us.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.350
Thank you.

27:30.510 --> 27:33.100
But I didn't want to mess
things up with Michelle.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.300
That's the last thing I wanted.

27:35.450 --> 27:38.710
I know you didn't.

27:41.920 --> 27:46.820
But I suppose we should make
an appointment with the agency,

27:47.010 --> 27:50.250
start looking for another surrogate.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.010
Are you okay with that?

27:53.010 --> 27:54.370
* Till I was laughing *

27:54.570 --> 27:58.390
I mean, I'm a little disappointed.

27:58.570 --> 28:00.970
I thought Michelle
was the one, you know?

28:01.060 --> 28:02.300
I know.

28:02.300 --> 28:07.300
* San Francisco Town *

28:07.300 --> 28:11.300
* It was a good life. *

28:11.300 --> 28:14.960
* It was a good life. *

28:25.540 --> 28:27.040
Some dinner, huh?

28:27.150 --> 28:29.250
Yeah.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.450
I don't think that we've
had a dinner like that

28:31.580 --> 28:37.190
since the last time you were here.

28:38.690 --> 28:42.170
What now?

28:42.330 --> 28:43.320
Leave in the morning, I guess.

28:43.470 --> 28:44.420
Just like that?

28:44.570 --> 28:49.260
Yep, just like that.

28:49.410 --> 28:53.150
Well, I, uh, I wanted
to show you something.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.020
What's this?

28:55.120 --> 28:56.490
Uh, well, it's, uh,

28:56.590 --> 28:58.970
It's a book that I'm...
I'm making for Evan.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.100
Some people call it a life book.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.400
Pictures and stories and...

29:03.550 --> 29:04.510
you know, for when he's older.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.390
So he can understand where he came from.

29:08.510 --> 29:09.800
Oh...

29:09.900 --> 29:11.120
He's beautiful.

29:11.310 --> 29:14.440
Yep. He is. He is.

29:14.540 --> 29:15.980
But...

29:16.160 --> 29:19.520
You know, it's funny that before
I found out that I had cancer,

29:19.660 --> 29:24.100
this book was about his
past, and... and now it's...

29:24.280 --> 29:26.760
It's all about his future.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.870
You know, where he... where he's going.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.070
I...

29:31.460 --> 29:34.050
I keep finding myself
giving him all this advice,

29:34.240 --> 29:38.080
like what to do when
you encounter a bully,

29:38.220 --> 29:41.100
and what to do when his heart breaks,

29:41.240 --> 29:43.790
and...

29:43.940 --> 29:47.260
My words of wisdom,
I guess, just in case.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.270
Don't say that.

29:51.450 --> 29:53.980
You will be there for him, Kitty.

29:54.090 --> 29:57.310
Yeah, I hope so.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.670
But you know what?
That is not the point.

29:59.810 --> 30:02.310
The point is, is that
even if the worst happens,

30:02.410 --> 30:06.540
I am going to be there for
him in whatever way I can.

30:06.650 --> 30:09.530
Are you, uh, giving me
a guilt trip right now?

30:09.630 --> 30:15.670
Yeah. If it works, yeah.

30:15.770 --> 30:18.410
Julia is never gonna take me back.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.910
Yeah, maybe not.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.310
But it doesn't matter.

30:24.450 --> 30:29.830
Elizabeth still needs you.

30:31.300 --> 30:36.540
And I probably have
to go change a diaper.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.220
I love you.

30:40.330 --> 30:44.000
Love you.

30:57.740 --> 31:01.730
Oh, this is good. This is good.

31:01.870 --> 31:04.970
I still don't understand why you
need Holly's financial records.

31:05.110 --> 31:06.180
You don't read the business section,

31:06.280 --> 31:08.390
- Do you, Ryan? 
- Well, between unloading trucks of fruit

31:08.490 --> 31:09.570
and snooping around people's offices,

31:09.710 --> 31:11.810
I haven't found much reading time.

31:11.810 --> 31:13.810
You know what we have here?

31:13.950 --> 31:15.280
Lasgrove investment fund

31:15.390 --> 31:17.890
has been caught running a Ponzi Scheme.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.450
Thousands of people have
lost their life savings.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.670
- Holly is apparently one of them. 
- So what?

31:22.800 --> 31:25.930
- Lower your voice. 
- Listen, you came to me.

31:26.070 --> 31:28.020
You told me William Walker
had ruined your life,

31:28.120 --> 31:30.350
you would help me do a
little damage on his legacy.

31:30.460 --> 31:31.520
If this is about you getting involved

31:31.670 --> 31:33.860
in some business
opportunity, I want out.

31:33.970 --> 31:35.920
I'm tired of being
Saul's little pet project,

31:36.030 --> 31:38.210
and... and frankly, I
have nothing against Holly.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.870
If Holly's flat broke,
that's an opportunity for us.

31:42.020 --> 31:47.140
How? Because it means she'll be
open to selling her piece of Ojai.

31:47.260 --> 31:49.740
So... You wanna go back to Berkeley?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.230
You wanna forget about William Walker

31:51.330 --> 31:54.030
and whatever part he may have
played in your mother's suicide?

31:54.140 --> 31:56.990
I get it.

31:57.140 --> 32:03.790
I'm not gonna twist your arm.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.690
All right, fine.

32:08.850 --> 32:10.310
What do you want me to do?

32:10.410 --> 32:11.810
You're telling me that you're actually

32:11.910 --> 32:13.130
Going to go through with this, Sarah?

32:13.130 --> 32:15.620
I think it's a way that we can
get cash into the company fast.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.910
Come on, have you got
a better idea, Saul?

32:17.050 --> 32:17.970
'Cause I'm open to hearing it.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.970
Frankly, I'm not sure we
can actually trust her.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.520
When could we ever trust her?

32:21.660 --> 32:23.040
Listen, we go ahead with the plan,

32:23.150 --> 32:26.320
And you and I keep a tight
rein on her. Here she is.

32:26.430 --> 32:30.410
- You wanted to see me? 
- Don't look so nervous.

32:30.550 --> 32:33.840
- You giving me the green light? 
- Okay, holly, just for the record,

32:34.000 --> 32:37.490
I would just like to say that
I think it's a huge mistake.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.800
Well, I look forward
to proving you wrong.

32:39.950 --> 32:42.810
Yeah. Uh, we have a caveat.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.340
Saul and I will oversee the project.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.760
If this thing goes south or you
go over your projected costs,

32:47.870 --> 32:50.290
we'll pull the plug.

32:50.450 --> 32:52.330
Of course.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.890
You suing me for breach of
verbal contract or something?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.720
- Good one. 
- I get it, Kevin. You don't like me.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.310
- You think I'm a flake. Whatever. 
- I... I don't think you're a flake.

33:01.460 --> 33:02.910
Oh, come on. You think I don't hear

33:03.020 --> 33:05.940
all those smart-ass remarks you make
about me, about the way that I live?

33:05.940 --> 33:07.350
I'm... I'm a smart-ass.
I'll admit that.

33:07.540 --> 33:09.540
But I... I am sorry if you think
I don't like you, because I do.

33:09.540 --> 33:11.800
You just don't trust me then?

33:11.940 --> 33:13.590
No, no. I... no, I don't trust anyone.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.850
It's just a santa claus
thing from way back.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.980
Kevin, why are you here?

33:20.120 --> 33:23.650
To beg.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.720
May I?

33:31.510 --> 33:36.730
To see if there is any way
you would still be willing...

33:36.870 --> 33:42.830
Scotty and I would both love
for you to be our surrogate.

33:42.830 --> 33:45.570
* Lay you down *

33:45.900 --> 33:49.590
Michelle, my... my brother
has a daughter... Elizabeth...

33:49.820 --> 33:53.020
A beautiful little girl
who means a lot to me...

33:53.130 --> 33:54.340
A whole lot.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.370
And right now,

33:55.510 --> 33:58.980
He and his wife are
going through a divorce.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.830
And she won't let him see Elizabeth.

34:00.940 --> 34:04.040
And he was an ass. He
behaved appallingly.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.120
And she's hurt and angry

34:06.220 --> 34:09.909
And fighting back the
only way she knows how.

34:10.050 --> 34:13.590
But at the center of
it all is a little girl

34:13.739 --> 34:17.460
who's not allowed to see her dad.

34:17.610 --> 34:22.080
Look, I know a contract is no guarantee.

34:22.190 --> 34:26.710
So I hope you can
understand, I feel so helpless

34:26.820 --> 34:29.630
and so out of control in this situation,

34:29.739 --> 34:32.030
I need a signature on a dotted line.

34:32.139 --> 34:37.719
Because the thought
of losing my child...

34:37.830 --> 34:42.710
It's... It's too much for me.

34:42.850 --> 34:44.409
Kevin, I can't even read it,

34:44.560 --> 34:45.860
with all the stipulations

34:46.040 --> 34:49.070
and... and the parties
of the blah, blah, blah.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.150
Okay, here's what we're gonna do...

34:50.270 --> 34:51.340
I'm gonna get you an attorney.

34:51.480 --> 34:55.060
I will pay for the best
family lawyer in Los Angeles.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.720
He will be your advocate,
there just for you,

34:57.780 --> 35:00.540
and he will explain every
clause and every stipulation,

35:00.640 --> 35:04.100
And if anything...
Anything... doesn't sit right,

35:04.200 --> 35:08.050
We will fix it. I promise.

35:08.190 --> 35:08.990
Okay.

35:09.130 --> 35:12.350
But I am totally going
home for Christmas.

35:12.460 --> 35:16.060
I will totally drive you myself.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.920
I'm preggers!

35:20.770 --> 35:22.120
I was so surprised.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.480
She was absolutely fine, happy even.

35:25.620 --> 35:28.060
Well, you have very smart
and understanding children.

35:28.170 --> 35:29.810
Thank you.

35:29.950 --> 35:31.480
She is smart.

35:31.610 --> 35:34.990
The, um, the spare room idea was hers.

35:35.090 --> 35:39.280
Mm. Well, I will try not
to hold that against her.

35:45.680 --> 35:46.590
What is it?

35:46.780 --> 35:50.100
Mm. Well, y...

35:50.250 --> 35:53.560
You're gonna be staying
here with me and my kids.

35:53.710 --> 35:56.510
I mean, you realize that
means the fantasy is over.

35:56.660 --> 35:58.670
This is...

35:58.820 --> 36:02.630
This is me in real life now.

36:02.780 --> 36:05.420
I want to be part of your real life.

36:05.550 --> 36:07.280
Why, is that... Is that a problem?

36:07.380 --> 36:09.140
It's just, the more real this gets,

36:09.250 --> 36:12.330
the more I ask myself questions.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.140
Like what?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.150
Like what are you doing?

36:17.150 --> 36:21.310
Come on. Girls like me don't
generally get guys like you.

36:21.410 --> 36:25.320
- Except there is... There are no girls like you. 
- Oh, believe you me,

36:25.470 --> 36:27.970
There's plenty of overworked
single mothers out there.

36:28.110 --> 36:30.070
It's the impossibly charming Frenchmen

36:30.180 --> 36:33.210
who are in short supply.

36:33.310 --> 36:36.970
I think you don't believe
you deserve to be happy.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.860
No. No, I do.

36:40.970 --> 36:44.560
I guess for me, happiness is...

36:44.660 --> 36:48.430
is messy and complicated.

36:48.570 --> 36:52.470
Well, messy and complicated is my forte.

36:52.590 --> 36:54.120
So...

36:54.230 --> 36:57.420
It's not gonna be as hard as you think.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.880
You'll see.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.170
Mm.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.340
All right.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.720
I'm here.

37:28.860 --> 37:30.200
Can I order you something?

37:30.350 --> 37:33.910
I would kill for a drink.
But it's a little early.

37:34.030 --> 37:36.140
- Rough day? 
- Rough enough.

37:36.250 --> 37:39.050
Well, let me see if I
can brighten it for you.

37:39.170 --> 37:42.590
I wanna buy your share of Ojai.

37:42.750 --> 37:45.180
Really? I'll even
double what it's worth.

37:45.290 --> 37:47.210
You'll clear enough to retire,
start your own business...

37:47.320 --> 37:48.770
Whatever you want.

37:48.890 --> 37:51.560
That certainly is a generous offer,

37:51.670 --> 37:55.950
but I have to pass.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.900
Well, that's... that's too bad.
I thought you'd be amenable.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.610
Why? You don't know me.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.390
But I know the Walkers.

38:03.500 --> 38:05.100
I think that anyone in their right minds

38:05.240 --> 38:07.490
would want to get as far
from them as possible.

38:07.630 --> 38:10.010
Not to mention, that's a
lot of money to pass up.

38:10.110 --> 38:14.760
I know, but I'm okay for now.

38:15.130 --> 38:18.310
William Walker's been dead for years.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.790
What are you still doing
in bed with his family?

38:21.940 --> 38:24.500
Well, it's flattering
that you're so concerned

38:24.600 --> 38:27.400
About my bed and who's in it...

38:27.550 --> 38:31.770
but the answer is still no.

38:38.300 --> 38:41.130
I'm, uh, I'm sorry I'm leaving so soon.

38:41.270 --> 38:44.210
Oh, come on. I... I...
I think it's a great idea.

38:44.330 --> 38:46.010
I mean, I'm just... I'm
just so happy you came.

38:46.170 --> 38:50.230
It meant the... the world to me.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.070
You're gonna get through this, Kitty.

38:52.190 --> 38:55.860
Oh. Your mouth to god's ears.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.700
You call me... Anytime, anywhere.

38:58.810 --> 39:00.190
I'm just a plane ride away.

39:00.290 --> 39:02.500
I will.

39:02.650 --> 39:05.160
Good morning.

39:05.290 --> 39:07.200
Good morning.

39:07.350 --> 39:09.190
Um...

39:09.340 --> 39:11.570
Did you know that tommy's leaving?

39:12.980 --> 39:15.530
Yes, I see that.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.230
I'm rooting for you.

39:21.350 --> 39:23.030
I'm rooting for you, too. Mm.

39:23.150 --> 39:27.030
- Love you 
- Love you.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.330
I wish you would stay.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.540
Why, so we can beat each
other up a little bit more?

39:40.650 --> 39:44.440
Well... Yes, in a way.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.820
This is a battle we
both have to go through.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.520
Please allow me to struggle
through this with you

39:49.630 --> 39:51.430
and show you I can be there for you.

39:51.550 --> 39:54.340
Ah, mom. Do we have
to do this right now?

39:54.470 --> 39:57.890
I'm... I'm... I'm worn out. I just...

39:58.040 --> 40:01.510
I can't.

40:01.620 --> 40:02.800
Oh, Tommy.

40:02.910 --> 40:04.270
Please give me a chance to know you

40:04.460 --> 40:07.580
and for you to know me.

40:07.730 --> 40:09.600
Not now. Okay, not now.

40:09.710 --> 40:16.060
But just think about it
when you get back to Mexico.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.100
I'm not going to Mexico.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.000
I'm gonna go to Seattle.

40:23.850 --> 40:26.720
Really?

40:26.860 --> 40:30.740
I need to be close to Elizabeth.

40:30.890 --> 40:31.980
I need to be a father to her.

40:32.090 --> 40:38.040
I... I need her to know that
I'm trying to fix my mistakes.

40:38.970 --> 40:45.010
Well, I'm trying to do that, too.

40:45.150 --> 40:49.580
I'll call you.

40:49.770 --> 40:53.110
So I'll see you when I see you.
