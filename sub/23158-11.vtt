WEBVTT

00:05.211 --> 00:07.441
You've written seven chapters
of his autobiography

00:07.513 --> 00:08.946
and you haven't even
met him?

00:09.015 --> 00:10.676
He's an eccentric.

00:12.652 --> 00:14.586
Dinner
or open-heart surgery?

00:14.654 --> 00:15.848
Germs.

00:15.922 --> 00:18.015
Harold W. Farber.

00:18.091 --> 00:19.854
Where... where
is she?

00:19.926 --> 00:22.087
Who's the insurance
salesman?

02:38.582 --> 02:40.140
Come over here.

02:42.519 --> 02:45.352
You never made this trip,
you understand?

02:45.655 --> 02:46.781
Why?

02:46.857 --> 02:48.290
We have competitors.

02:48.358 --> 02:50.588
Industrial
espionage security.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.890
It's all legal,
and above board.

02:52.963 --> 02:54.863
If you got any more
of these trips

02:54.931 --> 02:57.525
that I didn't make,
you just call me.

03:23.794 --> 03:25.728
Well, first
he's gonna tell you

03:25.796 --> 03:28.356
he's not gonna take you
anyplace anymore.

03:28.432 --> 03:30.559
And then
he's gonna tell you

03:31.168 --> 03:33.932
about all the favors he's
done for you in the past.

03:34.004 --> 03:35.631
And then
last but not least,

03:35.705 --> 03:37.866
he'll probably tell you
never to call him again.

03:37.941 --> 03:39.772
You think it's gonna be
that bad, Rick?

03:39.843 --> 03:41.743
It's just a little
gas money.

03:41.812 --> 03:44.440
You're gonna get your chance
to find out right now.

03:44.514 --> 03:45.674
Hi, everybody.

03:45.749 --> 03:48.411
Oh, no, no, no, no, Thomas,
let me pay for that.

03:50.187 --> 03:52.781
This is for Thomas' beer,

03:55.091 --> 03:58.151
and this is for a round
of drinks for everybody.

03:58.228 --> 04:00.355
I hope you can
break this down, Rick baby.

04:00.430 --> 04:02.022
$100? What did you do,
rob a bank?

04:02.098 --> 04:04.293
Orville,
you're such a joker.

04:04.367 --> 04:08.394
Uh, T.C., I hate to be the one
to spoil your happy mood.

04:08.772 --> 04:10.899
Oh, look, I-I'll just
come right out with it.

04:10.974 --> 04:14.205
I don't have the money that
I promised to give you today.

04:14.377 --> 04:16.743
Tut, tut, tut.
Not to worry, Thomas.

04:16.813 --> 04:19.373
You can give it to me
tomorrow, next week.

04:19.449 --> 04:23.681
Whenever you get it is soon
enough for me, brother.

04:23.854 --> 04:26.550
All right, T.C.,
spit it out. What's up?

04:26.623 --> 04:27.715
What's up?

04:27.791 --> 04:28.815
Yeah, what's up?

04:28.892 --> 04:31.486
Buying these drinks, and now
this business with the gas money.

04:31.561 --> 04:34.086
You've been waiting weeks for
the gas money. You know that.

04:34.164 --> 04:35.358
Uh, Rick.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.395
Let's just say

04:38.468 --> 04:42.632
that my chopper business
has finally paid off.

04:43.273 --> 04:44.865
I mean, a few days ago,

04:44.941 --> 04:47.603
I did a respectable
piece of business.

04:47.677 --> 04:50.441
Hell, that's great, T.C.
What did you do?

04:50.881 --> 04:51.973
I can't say.

04:52.048 --> 04:53.572
Oh, wonderful.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.777
I didn't do anything wrong.

04:55.852 --> 04:58.184
It's just that
it's very confidential.

04:58.255 --> 05:00.815
And very,
very profitable.

05:00.891 --> 05:01.983
Magnum.

05:02.592 --> 05:03.854
The keys.

05:03.927 --> 05:05.155
What is it now,
Higgins?

05:05.228 --> 05:07.059
The alarm system
is still not functional.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.461
I fixed it yesterday.

05:08.532 --> 05:11.057
Be that as it may,
it was inoperable this afternoon.

05:11.134 --> 05:13.432
Well, Zeus and Apollo
keep digging up the wires.

05:13.503 --> 05:15.698
I don't care why
it's inoperable, Magnum.

05:15.772 --> 05:18.172
Our deal was, you fix the system,
you drive the Ferrari.

05:18.241 --> 05:20.334
Since it isn't repaired...

05:21.912 --> 05:23.436
How am I gonna get home?

05:24.748 --> 05:25.840
Higgy baby,

05:25.916 --> 05:29.147
I was hoping that I would
run into you today.

05:29.319 --> 05:32.083
Uh, I've been thinking
of making some investments,

05:32.155 --> 05:33.383
and, uh, I was hoping

05:33.456 --> 05:36.220
that maybe you might
give me some advice.

05:38.261 --> 05:39.523
Well, uh,

05:39.596 --> 05:42.759
perhaps the local bank,
a savings account.

05:42.933 --> 05:44.127
No, no, no, no,

05:44.200 --> 05:48.193
uh, I have a few thou
to invest and I don't think

05:48.405 --> 05:52.273
that a savings account would, uh,
reap me my best deal.

05:54.878 --> 05:56.175
Well, uh,

05:56.246 --> 05:59.579
as a matter of fact, I am putting
together a small group of investors.

05:59.649 --> 06:02.584
T.C., you do not want
to get involved with Higgins

06:02.652 --> 06:04.847
and his regiment
of Her Majesty's pensioners.

06:04.921 --> 06:07.913
My prescience in matters of
business has paid off handsomely.

06:07.991 --> 06:10.425
He owns a couple of slummy
buildings in Honolulu.

06:10.493 --> 06:12.290
They are modern works of art,

06:12.362 --> 06:14.091
paragons of design.

06:15.165 --> 06:16.689
Thomas Magnum.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.062
I'm Magnum.

06:18.134 --> 06:19.726
Virginia Fowler.

06:19.803 --> 06:22.533
I, uh, just had a phone
conversation with Robin Masters,

06:22.606 --> 06:24.369
and he suggested
I contact you.

06:24.441 --> 06:27.103
Would you mind driving me
back to my hotel?

06:27.177 --> 06:28.337
Your hotel?

06:28.411 --> 06:29.639
Please.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.807
I need your help.

06:31.881 --> 06:32.973
Of course.

06:33.049 --> 06:36.177
I'm sure that Mr. Masters
would want me to help.

06:38.888 --> 06:40.685
Thank you
very much.

06:48.865 --> 06:51.800
<i>Virginia Fowler was famous</i>
<i>in a quiet sort of a way.</i>

06:51.868 --> 06:54.496
<i>She'd ghostwritten some of</i>
<i>the popular autobiographies</i>

06:54.571 --> 06:55.936
<i>in the last five years.</i>

06:56.006 --> 06:59.032
<i>Movie stars, athletes and</i>
<i>politicians would turn to her</i>

06:59.109 --> 07:01.373
<i>if they couldn't</i>
<i>turn a phrase.</i>

07:20.397 --> 07:22.592
<i>Work on her current book</i>
<i>had been going well.</i>

07:22.666 --> 07:24.099
<i>That is, until today.</i>

07:24.167 --> 07:27.068
<i>She came home from a morning</i>
<i>swim to find trouble.</i>

07:27.137 --> 07:29.435
<i>The kind of sensational stuff</i>
<i>that in a book</i>

07:29.506 --> 07:31.736
<i>usually makes</i>
<i>for bad reviews.</i>

07:50.660 --> 07:52.525
Anything else missing?

07:53.096 --> 07:54.256
No.

07:54.631 --> 07:55.723
They only took

07:55.799 --> 07:58.996
all the papers having to do
with Harold Farber's book,

07:59.069 --> 08:01.833
and the tapes
of my first seven chapters.

08:01.905 --> 08:03.600
Who doesn't want
the book written?

08:03.673 --> 08:06.267
Just about everybody
who is mentioned in it.

08:06.342 --> 08:09.209
Farber doesn't want me
to pull any punches.

08:09.379 --> 08:11.745
How many people know
this book is being written?

08:11.815 --> 08:13.248
A lot of people.

08:13.316 --> 08:14.908
But only Farber

08:14.984 --> 08:17.214
and Emerson White,
his managing director,

08:17.287 --> 08:19.414
know that it's being
ghostwritten by me.

08:19.489 --> 08:21.081
If someone were
concerned enough,

08:21.157 --> 08:22.920
they'd find out
who was writing it.

08:22.992 --> 08:25.324
You probably got tailed
to one of his meetings.

08:25.395 --> 08:26.657
Meetings?

08:27.897 --> 08:29.922
I've never even seen
Harold Farber.

08:29.999 --> 08:32.467
All our conversations
have been over the phone.

08:32.534 --> 08:34.832
You've written seven chapters
of his autobiography,

08:34.904 --> 08:36.371
and you haven't even
met him?

08:36.438 --> 08:38.100
He's an eccentric.

08:40.176 --> 08:42.667
Excuse me.
That might be important.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.719
<i>Harold Farber was</i>

08:51.788 --> 08:53.653
<i>the human equivalent</i>
<i>of Bigfoot.</i>

08:53.723 --> 08:55.247
<i>He made the headlines a lot,</i>

08:55.325 --> 08:57.259
<i>but hardly anyone</i>
<i>had ever seen him.</i>

08:57.327 --> 09:00.524
<i>And nobody knew when he'd</i>
<i>make another appearance.</i>

09:01.030 --> 09:03.464
<i>I wasn't so sure</i>
<i>he even existed.</i>

09:07.003 --> 09:08.630
Okay.

09:09.139 --> 09:10.606
That was Emerson White,

09:10.673 --> 09:13.369
managing director
of Farber Industries.

09:13.576 --> 09:17.603
It seems I've been invited
to lunch by Harold Farber.

09:18.882 --> 09:22.181
Do you know how long I've been
trying to get to meet that guy?

09:22.252 --> 09:24.152
Don't you think
that's kind of funny?

09:24.220 --> 09:26.415
I mean, coming right after
your stuff being stolen?

09:26.489 --> 09:28.616
I think
I better go with you.

09:28.825 --> 09:29.917
How?

09:36.399 --> 09:38.833
<i>It had been a long time</i>
<i>since I put my suit on.</i>

09:38.902 --> 09:41.496
<i>I was surprised</i>
<i>it was still in style.</i>

09:41.571 --> 09:43.903
<i>And still smelt</i>
<i>like mothballs.</i>

10:06.329 --> 10:09.025
They don't recognize you
all dressed up.

10:09.599 --> 10:11.362
Very funny, Higgins.

10:14.304 --> 10:15.430
Higgins!

10:15.505 --> 10:17.530
Ah. They recognize
the voice.

10:17.607 --> 10:18.938
Higgins, call them off.

10:19.008 --> 10:20.999
I'm afraid they'll have to
stay on patrol

10:21.077 --> 10:22.908
until the alarm system
is operational.

10:22.979 --> 10:24.241
I'll fix it tomorrow.

10:24.314 --> 10:25.804
We shouldn't put off
until tomorrow...

10:25.882 --> 10:27.213
What we can do today.

10:27.283 --> 10:28.944
Higgins, we wouldn't want

10:29.018 --> 10:32.283
Robin Masters to find out I was
late picking up Miss Fowler,

10:32.355 --> 10:34.050
because of the lads,
would we?

10:35.658 --> 10:37.421
Zeus, Apollo, come.

10:39.762 --> 10:41.525
Thank you very much.

11:05.388 --> 11:07.015
<i>I was running late.</i>

11:07.090 --> 11:09.217
<i>I had taken too much time</i>
<i>getting dressed,</i>

11:09.292 --> 11:10.953
<i>and that's a bad sign.</i>

11:11.027 --> 11:12.654
<i>Instead of</i>
<i>worrying about the job</i>

11:12.729 --> 11:14.458
<i>I was going to do</i>
<i>for my client,</i>

11:14.530 --> 11:17.829
<i>my mind was taken up with</i>
<i>picking exactly the right tie.</i>

11:17.901 --> 11:19.334
<i>As if it matters.</i>

11:19.402 --> 11:20.994
I like that tie.

11:36.886 --> 11:39.616
<i>The Farber building security</i>
<i>was more than good.</i>

11:39.689 --> 11:41.623
<i>But it made me</i>
<i>a little uneasy.</i>

11:41.691 --> 11:45.149
<i>I never liked places you</i>
<i>couldn't enter from the street.</i>

12:20.029 --> 12:23.055
I'm Virginia Fowler
and this is my assistant.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.462
Are you Miss Fowler?

12:27.170 --> 12:28.432
Yes.

12:28.938 --> 12:32.669
And, uh,
is this your assistant?

12:32.909 --> 12:34.069
Yes.

12:34.610 --> 12:36.737
I'm Barker, ma'am,

12:37.380 --> 12:40.315
Mr. Farber's
gentlemen's gentleman.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.710
Come with me.

13:16.619 --> 13:18.177
Here she comes.

13:25.995 --> 13:27.087
Yes?

13:27.964 --> 13:29.864
She's visiting Farber.

13:30.333 --> 13:33.564
Don't worry, I'll be back
before they are through.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.377
Who's that with her?

13:47.717 --> 13:49.514
That's her assistant.

13:49.852 --> 13:53.185
I want a complete background
on him before he leaves here.

13:53.256 --> 13:55.019
Arthur, you're
chief of security.

13:55.091 --> 13:56.353
He should have been checked.

13:56.426 --> 13:58.986
Yes, sir.
I, uh, I'll call research.

14:28.124 --> 14:30.285
Dinner
or open-heart surgery?

14:30.660 --> 14:32.150
This is great.

14:34.697 --> 14:36.494
I think this is gold.

14:44.707 --> 14:47.801
You're gonna put this
in your book, Miss Fowler?

14:48.578 --> 14:49.840
Who would believe it?

14:49.912 --> 14:52.039
Yes, you're probably right.

14:54.217 --> 14:57.311
Miss Fowler,
nice to see you

14:58.421 --> 15:00.252
in the compound
for the first time.

15:00.323 --> 15:02.757
Mr. White, I thought
you were in New York

15:02.825 --> 15:04.918
preparing for the board
of directors' meeting.

15:04.994 --> 15:06.689
I leave in the morning.

15:06.762 --> 15:08.992
Uh, this is Thomas Milton,
my assistant.

15:09.065 --> 15:12.626
Emerson White, Harold Farber's eyes,
ears and right hand.

15:12.902 --> 15:15.996
And the one responsible
for getting information to me.

15:17.106 --> 15:20.007
It's nice to finally put a
face with the name, Mr. White.

15:20.076 --> 15:22.601
And I must say,
I am particularly looking forward

15:22.678 --> 15:25.169
to meeting the elusive
Harold Farber in person.

15:25.248 --> 15:27.648
Yes. Well, this meeting
was called rather abruptly

15:27.717 --> 15:30.447
because of Mr. Farber's
deteriorating health.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.614
He wanted to be sure to meet
Miss Fowler while he still could.

15:33.689 --> 15:34.747
I must say that

15:34.824 --> 15:36.792
Miss Fowler and I
were really quite surprised

15:36.859 --> 15:38.793
when the invitation
came in this morning.

15:38.861 --> 15:41.887
We have difficulty
getting him up for visitors.

15:41.964 --> 15:43.022
Mr. White?

15:43.099 --> 15:44.157
Yes?

15:44.233 --> 15:46.098
Why are we wearing these?

15:46.169 --> 15:47.397
Germs.

15:47.703 --> 15:48.965
Of course.

15:49.038 --> 15:52.064
I certainly hope that
Mr. Farber is feeling better

15:52.141 --> 15:54.701
than the last time
I spoke with him.

15:55.278 --> 15:56.768
When was that?

15:56.979 --> 15:59.413
A week ago yesterday
at 10:00 a.m.

15:59.482 --> 16:00.972
I remember
because when I heard

16:01.050 --> 16:03.382
Harold Farber himself was on the line,
I got so nervous.

16:03.452 --> 16:04.544
What did he say?

16:04.620 --> 16:06.884
Oh, he was
a bit incoherent,

16:06.956 --> 16:08.924
but, uh, he knew
he was very ill

16:08.991 --> 16:11.482
and wanted me to finish the
book as quickly as possible.

16:11.561 --> 16:12.653
That's wonderful.

16:12.728 --> 16:15.526
Mr. Farber has boxed up some more
of his papers for you to take,

16:15.598 --> 16:17.293
some personal papers
this time.

16:17.366 --> 16:19.994
Oh! What a relief!
Without those papers,

16:20.069 --> 16:21.798
Miss Fowler
would have had to skip

16:21.871 --> 16:24.465
our subject's
private life altogether.

16:27.643 --> 16:29.804
Lady and gentlemen,

16:29.879 --> 16:31.972
Harold W. Farber.

16:32.048 --> 16:33.879
Will you stop following me?

16:33.950 --> 16:35.542
I know where I'm going!

16:35.618 --> 16:38.519
Where is she?

16:39.121 --> 16:41.954
Mr. Farber,
may I present Miss Fowler.

16:43.526 --> 16:47.257
Oh, White, you weren't kidding
when you said she's a looker.

16:48.965 --> 16:51.160
Who's the insurance salesman?

16:52.201 --> 16:54.032
I'm Miss Fowler's
assistant, sir.

16:54.103 --> 16:56.594
I must say, it's a thrill
and a pleasure to meet you.

16:56.672 --> 16:58.435
Well, you sit there.

16:59.075 --> 17:02.670
And you, you will sit by me.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.244
Get your cotton-picking
hands off me.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.311
Get your hands off me!
Get... get...

17:16.525 --> 17:17.856
What wine?

17:21.230 --> 17:22.219
Oh.

17:22.598 --> 17:23.963
Scriptures.

17:25.101 --> 17:26.897
Give us a scripture.

17:29.105 --> 17:32.871
Uh, "Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth."

17:33.509 --> 17:34.601
Amen.

17:42.718 --> 17:44.549
What is this stuff?
It tastes funny.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.952
Chateau Lafitte, sir.

17:47.056 --> 17:48.250
19...

17:48.324 --> 17:51.157
I say, 1949.

17:52.295 --> 17:53.887
We're out of muscatel?

17:53.963 --> 17:56.591
We'll try locating
some for you, sir.

18:07.943 --> 18:10.605
Barker, this stuff
gives me heartburn.

18:11.347 --> 18:12.473
Now,

18:13.015 --> 18:14.073
you,

18:15.251 --> 18:16.878
you want my story.

18:19.488 --> 18:21.183
The poor master!

18:21.257 --> 18:22.519
He'll be okay.

18:22.591 --> 18:24.491
Shouldn't he go
to a hospital?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.653
Harold Farber
doesn't go to hospitals.

18:26.729 --> 18:29.027
Hospitals
go to Harold Farber.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.528
Take him to bed
and get Dr. Roberts.

18:32.601 --> 18:33.932
Yes, sir.

18:37.973 --> 18:40.237
I'm terribly sorry
about this, Miss Fowler.

18:40.309 --> 18:43.176
We can count on
your discretion, of course.

18:43.412 --> 18:44.777
Of course.

18:45.414 --> 18:46.904
Discretion?

18:46.982 --> 18:49.246
That, sir,
goes without saying.

18:57.626 --> 18:59.218
How was Farber?

18:59.428 --> 19:00.793
True to form.

19:00.863 --> 19:02.262
That's good.

19:02.698 --> 19:05.633
'Cause that assistant's
real name is Thomas Magnum,

19:05.701 --> 19:08.169
an ex-Naval intelligence
officer,

19:08.304 --> 19:10.738
currently
a private investigator.

19:16.479 --> 19:19.107
<i>Well, I've now met</i>
<i>Harold Farber.</i>

19:19.181 --> 19:22.241
<i>But you know,</i>
<i>I still wasn't sure he existed.</i>

19:55.851 --> 19:57.876
They put me
in a new bungalow.

19:57.953 --> 19:59.978
It's gonna take days
to clean up the old one.

20:00.055 --> 20:02.683
You're lucky
they didn't kick you out.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.798
Oh, no. Not again.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.465
Now they are
gonna kick you out.

20:14.670 --> 20:15.796
Hey.

20:16.605 --> 20:19.267
It's all right.
I think I got an idea.

20:21.110 --> 20:22.668
<i>Virginia needed protection,</i>

20:22.745 --> 20:25.009
<i>so I brought her</i>
<i>to Robin Masters' guesthouse.</i>

20:25.080 --> 20:27.241
<i>I'd done as much</i>
<i>for other clients,</i>

20:27.316 --> 20:29.784
<i>but maybe</i>
<i>never quite as willingly.</i>

20:30.953 --> 20:33.285
What a fantastic life
you lead.

20:35.591 --> 20:36.853
You really think so?

20:36.926 --> 20:38.826
Have you always been
a private investigator?

20:38.894 --> 20:41.089
No, I used to be
a paper boy.

20:41.163 --> 20:42.994
Uh, I'm serious.

20:43.399 --> 20:45.390
I'm serious.
I was a Naval intelligent.

20:45.468 --> 20:46.457
Oh.

20:46.535 --> 20:48.696
You don't seem
like the type.

20:50.573 --> 20:53.201
The Navy, I mean,
not the intelligence.

20:53.275 --> 20:55.140
I know what you mean.

21:40.923 --> 21:42.322
Um, then?

21:42.858 --> 21:43.984
Then.

21:44.426 --> 21:46.223
You were in the Navy.

21:46.495 --> 21:48.463
Yes, I was in the Navy.

21:48.797 --> 21:51.095
A career man,
Navy all the way.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.158
What happened?

21:53.469 --> 21:56.404
I started asking myself
a lot of questions.

21:58.207 --> 21:59.333
And?

22:00.976 --> 22:02.603
I'm still asking.

22:17.426 --> 22:20.793
I just hate putting you out
of your bedroom like this.

22:21.263 --> 22:22.890
Sure you'll be
all right there?

22:22.965 --> 22:24.489
Oh, it's fine.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.664
You, uh, you should stay
in the bedroom.

22:28.337 --> 22:30.635
It's safer, more secure.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.973
Interesting evening.

22:33.042 --> 22:34.839
Oh, I guess so.
It's not everyday

22:34.910 --> 22:36.878
you get to see the
legendary Harold Farber

22:36.946 --> 22:39.278
fall blotto
at the dinner table.

22:39.915 --> 22:41.883
That's not what I meant.

22:44.153 --> 22:45.950
Good night, Virginia.

22:47.590 --> 22:49.353
Good night, Thomas.

23:14.617 --> 23:16.517
<i>I had this</i>
<i>very strict policy</i>

23:16.585 --> 23:19.019
<i>about not having</i>
<i>relationships with my clients.</i>

23:19.088 --> 23:22.023
<i>Anything else just</i>
<i>wouldn't be professional.</i>

23:22.424 --> 23:25.416
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>and you're right.</i>

24:07.036 --> 24:08.128
Get down!

24:08.204 --> 24:09.933
Somebody's trying
to shoot at one of us.

24:24.353 --> 24:25.980
Stay right there.

24:26.489 --> 24:27.786
Thomas.

24:27.857 --> 24:28.846
Thomas.

24:28.924 --> 24:30.391
What's going on?
What's wrong?

24:30.459 --> 24:32.051
Somebody tried to shoot me.

24:32.127 --> 24:33.185
Twice!

24:33.262 --> 24:34.286
Who is he?

24:34.363 --> 24:37.560
I don't know who he is,
but I intend to find out.

24:37.733 --> 24:39.360
Stay right there.

24:43.839 --> 24:44.897
Who sent you?

24:44.974 --> 24:46.100
Nobody.

24:46.175 --> 24:48.006
I said, who sent you?

24:56.151 --> 24:58.381
Now,
care to change your mind?

25:01.724 --> 25:03.783
<i>With my.45 nuzzling his ear,</i>

25:03.859 --> 25:06.157
<i>I expected the guy</i>
<i>to take us to his employer.</i>

25:06.228 --> 25:09.629
<i>What I didn't expect was</i>
<i>that he'd take us in a limo.</i>

25:14.904 --> 25:16.428
Oscar!

25:18.140 --> 25:21.075
I'm sorry, uh, I think
I'm in the wrong room.

25:21.577 --> 25:23.044
Mrs. Ballard!

25:25.214 --> 25:26.977
You know this woman?

25:28.851 --> 25:30.148
Virginia!

25:31.654 --> 25:33.087
Oh, dear me.

25:36.959 --> 25:40.326
Damn me. Now I've really
gone and done it, haven't I?

25:40.729 --> 25:42.287
Know this man?

25:42.631 --> 25:44.622
Of course. That's Oscar.

25:44.733 --> 25:47.429
Don't worry, Mrs. Ballard.
It's all right.

25:47.503 --> 25:48.993
Is the Senator with you?

25:49.071 --> 25:50.368
He's in Washington.

25:50.439 --> 25:52.464
He doesn't know I'm here.

25:53.142 --> 25:54.609
Senator Ballard's wife?

25:54.677 --> 25:55.803
Yes.

25:56.245 --> 25:57.940
What are you doing here then?

25:58.013 --> 26:00.345
And why are you sending
these gunmen after me?

26:00.416 --> 26:03.476
Oscar, I said no violence.

26:03.786 --> 26:06.346
It wasn't me, ma'am.
I swear.

26:06.755 --> 26:09.019
All I wanted
were the letters.

26:09.124 --> 26:10.386
What letters?

26:10.459 --> 26:12.188
They were shameful.

26:13.362 --> 26:16.354
It would just kill
the Senator if he knew.

26:16.432 --> 26:17.592
What letters?

26:17.666 --> 26:20.635
And my grandchildren,
my great-grandchildren.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.198
It's the only indiscretion
of my life.

26:24.340 --> 26:25.932
I was a young widow.

26:26.008 --> 26:28.169
I hadn't met
the Senator yet.

26:28.844 --> 26:30.175
Harold...

26:30.946 --> 26:33.380
Harold just
swept me off my feet.

26:33.649 --> 26:35.549
Oh. Harold Farber.

26:35.618 --> 26:37.950
You wrote some letters
to Harold Farber?

26:38.020 --> 26:40.921
Why didn't you just ask him
to return the letters?

26:40.990 --> 26:42.389
Well, I did.

26:42.658 --> 26:46.458
As soon as I heard about the
autobiography, I telephoned him.

26:46.662 --> 26:48.789
He said he'd give me
the letters.

26:48.864 --> 26:50.422
And when I got here
this week,

26:50.499 --> 26:52.194
they wouldn't let me
see him,

26:52.267 --> 26:54.929
or even speak to him
by telephone.

26:55.738 --> 26:58.036
And then they sent
the letters to you.

26:58.107 --> 26:59.199
Me?

26:59.575 --> 27:01.406
I don't have your letters.

27:01.477 --> 27:02.637
You don't?

27:02.711 --> 27:04.303
Okay, Mrs. Ballard.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.314
That explains
the two ransacked rooms,

27:06.382 --> 27:07.940
but who's trying to kill me?

27:08.017 --> 27:10.815
Certainly not Harold Farber.

27:10.886 --> 27:12.877
He's a very gentle man.

27:12.955 --> 27:14.946
He wouldn't harm anyone.

27:16.525 --> 27:18.857
I think I can get
those letters back for you.

27:18.927 --> 27:19.985
Wait a minute.

27:20.062 --> 27:23.691
After what happened last time I was
there, he owes me another visit.

27:23.766 --> 27:24.926
Now just hold on.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.696
I said somebody
just tried to kill me.

27:33.909 --> 27:35.433
Could you get me in there?

27:35.511 --> 27:36.978
No, she couldn't.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.241
Didn't you two
just hear what I said?

27:39.314 --> 27:41.578
Somebody's tried
to kill me, twice.

27:41.650 --> 27:43.845
And it has something to do
with Harold Farber.

27:43.919 --> 27:46.046
And besides that,
that could be dangerous.

27:46.121 --> 27:49.420
Well, then,
you'd better come with us.

27:51.927 --> 27:53.451
It's a simple question.

27:53.529 --> 27:55.326
Whose autobiography
is she writing?

27:55.397 --> 27:56.887
I can't tell you that.

27:56.965 --> 28:00.059
Well, then I can't do
you a favor. Sorry, pal.

28:00.602 --> 28:02.467
Come on, Rick.
Who she's writing about

28:02.538 --> 28:05.006
falls under client confidentiality.
You know that.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.063
Oh, I see.

28:06.141 --> 28:08.439
It's okay for you to send
me out on your goofy cases,

28:08.510 --> 28:10.944
but when it comes to anything else,
just forget it, right?

28:11.013 --> 28:12.105
No.

28:12.181 --> 28:14.012
I just can't tell you,
that's all.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.516
You just can't tell me,
that's all.

28:15.584 --> 28:16.812
You sound like T.C.

28:16.885 --> 28:18.648
He's been acting
like a KGB agent lately.

28:18.721 --> 28:21.417
Why is it that I bend over
backwards for you guys,

28:21.490 --> 28:22.923
I'll do anything for you,

28:22.991 --> 28:25.016
I ask you one simple question,
just one,

28:25.094 --> 28:27.790
and you act like
I come from <i>60 Minutes.</i>

28:28.063 --> 28:29.621
All right, all right,

28:29.698 --> 28:32.428
if I tell you,
will you do me the favor?

28:38.907 --> 28:40.101
Maybe.

28:40.175 --> 28:42.735
She's writing
a book about me.

28:44.646 --> 28:45.977
About you?

28:47.049 --> 28:48.141
That's a riot.

28:48.217 --> 28:49.479
What's so funny?

28:49.551 --> 28:52.213
It just so happens I've had
a pretty interesting life.

28:52.287 --> 28:55.950
Sure, a couple of chapters maybe,
but a whole book?

28:57.526 --> 29:00.393
I'm even including an item
or two about you, old buddy.

29:00.462 --> 29:01.520
You are? Like what?

29:01.597 --> 29:02.689
Like Bangkok.

29:02.765 --> 29:04.357
Like that girl
who wouldn't kiss you

29:04.433 --> 29:06.196
because she was
brought up in a convent.

29:06.268 --> 29:07.929
All the time
she was saying no,

29:08.003 --> 29:10.870
she was picking your pockets
and stealing your watch.

29:10.939 --> 29:12.065
That's not funny.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.234
Oh, some people think
it is very funny.

29:14.309 --> 29:15.901
That's personal stuff,
Thomas.

29:15.978 --> 29:18.469
Don't you need permission from
me to write stuff like that?

29:18.547 --> 29:19.741
I'm not writing it.

29:19.815 --> 29:21.976
I am merely
recounting my life

29:22.050 --> 29:25.542
and including the people and the
memories that have made it what it is.

29:25.621 --> 29:26.849
Thomas.

29:27.623 --> 29:28.885
Of course,

29:28.957 --> 29:32.017
I could forget to leave out
some of those stories

29:32.094 --> 29:33.527
if I really wanted to.

29:33.595 --> 29:35.392
Of course, I'm sure.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.262
All right,
I'll do the favor.

29:40.335 --> 29:42.166
Let's get one thing straight.

29:42.237 --> 29:44.262
I'm not gonna put on
any dumb disguise.

29:44.339 --> 29:46.330
I'm not playing
garbage man, delivery man,

29:46.408 --> 29:48.205
sewer man,
or any other kind of man.

29:48.277 --> 29:49.835
That-that's final,
all right?

29:49.912 --> 29:51.277
Of course.

30:10.732 --> 30:12.529
State your business.

30:13.402 --> 30:15.996
<i>Delivery.</i>
<i>Muscatel for the penthouse.</i>

30:16.104 --> 30:18.197
Someone will be right down.

30:19.341 --> 30:20.968
Barker, delivery.

30:27.015 --> 30:28.915
Mike,
keep an eye on Barker.

30:28.984 --> 30:30.747
He dozes off a lot.

30:39.828 --> 30:41.489
Can I help you,
sonny?

30:41.563 --> 30:43.827
Hey, pops. Got a little
delivery here for you.

30:45.033 --> 30:46.796
Hang on to that now.

30:47.002 --> 30:49.903
You all right?
Let me give you a hand here.

30:51.039 --> 30:52.939
You all right there, pop?
You got them?

30:53.008 --> 30:55.738
The master always takes
a small glass

30:55.811 --> 30:57.472
just at bedtime.

30:57.546 --> 30:59.707
Yeah, right.
You sure you got them now?

30:59.781 --> 31:01.715
I'm trying to
help you over here.

31:01.783 --> 31:05.150
Well, it looked like rain
earlier in the day.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.280
Rheumatism always tells me
when it's about to rain...

31:08.357 --> 31:10.382
Yeah, rain, it's gonna rain, pop.
You're right.

31:11.526 --> 31:13.858
It always rains
on Wednesdays.

31:13.929 --> 31:15.419
You got that?

31:15.497 --> 31:17.021
Uh, thank you.

31:20.969 --> 31:23.301
Okay, well, how come
I can't be a general partner

31:23.372 --> 31:24.703
as opposed to
a limited partner?

31:24.773 --> 31:26.297
Really, T.C.,
that's so elementary,

31:26.375 --> 31:27.774
I hardly know
where to begin.

31:27.843 --> 31:29.811
Since I'm getting ready
to invest a few thou,

31:29.878 --> 31:31.368
you better begin
at the beginning.

31:31.446 --> 31:33.038
It's simple, T.C.

31:33.115 --> 31:35.777
The limited partners
put up all the money,

31:35.851 --> 31:37.944
and the general partner
spends it

31:38.020 --> 31:40.545
and shares in the profits,
if there are any.

31:40.622 --> 31:41.611
Oh.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.487
Well, then I definitely
want to be

31:43.558 --> 31:44.855
the general partner.

31:44.927 --> 31:47.157
I'm afraid
that's impossible.

31:47.396 --> 31:48.488
How come?

31:48.563 --> 31:50.622
There already is
a general partner.

31:50.699 --> 31:51.791
Who?

31:51.867 --> 31:53.027
Me.

31:54.603 --> 31:55.729
Wait... wait... wait.

31:55.804 --> 31:58.170
You mean,
I'm putting in all my money,

31:58.240 --> 31:59.537
and you ain't putting in any,

31:59.608 --> 32:02.236
but, yet instead,
you get to sharing the profits?

32:02.311 --> 32:03.744
No way.
Look here, Higgins,

32:03.812 --> 32:06.007
if I find you trying to run
this con on anybody else,

32:06.081 --> 32:08.276
I'm gonna report you
to the Better Business Bureau.

32:09.451 --> 32:10.509
Uh...

32:10.585 --> 32:13.179
Here. This ain't
the key to the city.

32:13.388 --> 32:16.016
Just so long as it
fits the elevator.

32:17.859 --> 32:20.157
Hey, hey, hey,
where's my van? Is it okay?

32:20.228 --> 32:21.855
Your van is fine.

32:21.930 --> 32:22.954
Oh, T.C.,

32:23.031 --> 32:26.592
uh, one of my clients may need
to rent your chopper later.

32:29.504 --> 32:31.665
$100 an hour
for the chopper.

32:33.308 --> 32:34.366
Deal.

32:34.443 --> 32:36.070
And if I get shot at,

32:36.144 --> 32:38.704
it's triple plus damages.

32:38.780 --> 32:41.112
Why would you
get shot at, T.C.?

32:44.319 --> 32:47.982
OK, $100.
Double, if shot at.

32:48.156 --> 32:50.647
No. Triple,
if I get shot at.

32:50.726 --> 32:51.920
T.C.!

32:52.627 --> 32:53.821
Triple.

32:55.864 --> 32:56.990
Deal.

32:57.099 --> 32:58.566
Plus damages?

32:58.633 --> 33:00.157
Plus damages.

33:01.269 --> 33:03.294
Okay, where
are we flying?

33:04.006 --> 33:05.564
I want you to wait
by the phone.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.107
If you don't hear
from me by 8.00,

33:07.175 --> 33:10.804
I want you to land on the roof of
the Farber building and pick us up.

33:11.413 --> 33:12.607
No way.

33:13.448 --> 33:14.915
But you just said deal.

33:14.983 --> 33:16.575
I didn't. You did.

33:16.651 --> 33:18.312
T.C., what's going on?

33:18.387 --> 33:20.514
Let's just say that I'm getting smart,
that's all.

33:20.589 --> 33:21.851
Sorry, Thomas.

33:21.923 --> 33:23.413
Later, fellas.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.364
Curiouser and curiouser.

33:30.065 --> 33:32.795
Why would T.C.
Turn down all that money?

33:38.340 --> 33:39.807
<i>T.C. Backed out,</i>

33:39.875 --> 33:41.638
<i>but I still had to</i>
<i>go through with this.</i>

33:41.710 --> 33:43.234
<i>Somewhere I had this feeling</i>

33:43.311 --> 33:45.643
<i>he'd change his mind</i>
<i>and come through for me.</i>

33:45.714 --> 33:47.739
<i>At least I hoped he would.</i>

33:50.952 --> 33:52.442
Good afternoon,
Barker.

33:52.521 --> 33:54.455
Good afternoon, ma'am.

34:46.174 --> 34:48.266
Oh, my God!
He's fainted!

34:48.342 --> 34:50.106
Miss Fow...
Help!

34:50.178 --> 34:52.772
<i>Help! My God,</i>
<i>he's fainted!</i>

34:53.348 --> 34:54.507
<i>He's fainted.</i>

34:54.583 --> 34:56.141
<i>Help. Help.</i>

35:19.708 --> 35:20.800
Help!

35:21.543 --> 35:23.534
Miss Fowler, are you...

35:24.679 --> 35:26.340
The man...

35:26.948 --> 35:29.212
Uh, I know a heart attack
when I see one.

35:29.284 --> 35:30.376
I used to be a nurse.

35:30.452 --> 35:31.476
Heart attack?

35:31.553 --> 35:32.679
Yes.

35:42.864 --> 35:43.956
What?

35:47.202 --> 35:50.365
Well, we've got to get him
to a bed or something.

35:54.276 --> 35:56.176
Come on, old man.

36:42.023 --> 36:43.251
Harold.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.122
Harold.

36:48.763 --> 36:50.287
It's Frona.

36:50.365 --> 36:52.162
Is it still raining?

36:54.703 --> 36:56.466
He's drunk.

36:59.074 --> 37:00.200
Never.

37:04.779 --> 37:06.178
What's wrong?

37:06.248 --> 37:07.977
He looks different.

37:08.049 --> 37:09.846
When did you see him last?

37:09.918 --> 37:11.681
May 10, 1925.

37:14.856 --> 37:17.086
Well, people change,
you know.

37:17.459 --> 37:20.724
It's the shape
of his head, the nose.

37:21.062 --> 37:22.495
Something...

37:25.533 --> 37:26.727
What are you doing?

37:26.795 --> 37:29.229
Harold had a scar
on his chest.

37:31.306 --> 37:32.796
That's not Harold.

37:32.874 --> 37:34.739
What have they done
with my Harold?

38:58.309 --> 39:00.641
Come on,
let's get some exercise.

39:00.711 --> 39:02.201
Are you...
Come on!

39:20.197 --> 39:22.131
Let's get
some exercise.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.295
Forward.

40:05.176 --> 40:06.268
Back.

40:18.022 --> 40:19.182
Back.

40:44.215 --> 40:45.876
Hey, hey!

40:48.652 --> 40:50.347
What do you two think
you're doing?

40:50.421 --> 40:52.150
We don't allow
that kind of thing here.

41:00.030 --> 41:01.361
Orville, Orville.

41:01.432 --> 41:03.127
Hi, T.C.
No, I haven't seen him.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.258
Did you try the estate?

41:04.335 --> 41:06.769
I did, but Higgins said he
didn't come home last night.

41:06.837 --> 41:08.429
So maybe he got lucky.
You know him.

41:09.573 --> 41:10.801
Or shot at.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.036
He shouldn't mess around
with married women.

41:13.110 --> 41:15.544
Oh, man. He asked me
to help him and I wouldn't.

41:15.613 --> 41:16.875
He went off
and did it himself.

41:16.947 --> 41:18.505
Did what?
Get fresh fruit, will you?

41:18.582 --> 41:20.573
I think he went
to the Farber building.

41:20.651 --> 41:22.050
Harold Farber?

41:22.119 --> 41:23.916
So that's who
she's writing about.

41:23.988 --> 41:26.889
Offered big bucks to pick him up,
and I wouldn't do it.

41:27.591 --> 41:28.853
Do what?

41:49.747 --> 41:51.146
Mike.

41:54.451 --> 41:55.850
Mike!

42:53.410 --> 42:54.672
Come on.

42:58.549 --> 43:00.574
That's Harold.

43:03.821 --> 43:05.345
This guy is just a stand-in.

43:05.422 --> 43:08.858
I told you, l... I told you,
he wasn't the real Harold Farber.

43:08.926 --> 43:10.359
He's a fake.

43:12.296 --> 43:13.661
Is he dead?

43:14.164 --> 43:15.358
Very.

43:19.903 --> 43:20.961
What are they
up to?

43:21.038 --> 43:22.027
Quiet.

43:22.106 --> 43:23.664
There's only one reason
to freeze him,

43:23.741 --> 43:25.732
that's to announce
his death at a later date.

43:25.809 --> 43:27.834
Wait a minute. The board
of directors' meeting.

43:27.911 --> 43:28.935
That's it.

43:29.013 --> 43:31.004
He wants to vote
Farber's proxy one more time.

43:31.081 --> 43:32.105
That's right.
Come on.

43:32.182 --> 43:34.480
But why did they invite me here?
I'll get in their way.

43:34.551 --> 43:36.348
You're
a very valuable witness.

43:36.420 --> 43:38.115
Once they announce
Farber's death,

43:38.188 --> 43:40.418
you can tell everyone how
much time you spent with him

43:40.491 --> 43:41.981
the last week of his life.

43:42.059 --> 43:43.617
You can also verify
how sick he was.

43:43.694 --> 43:45.184
Come on, let's go.

43:48.766 --> 43:49.755
Oh.

43:50.301 --> 43:51.996
Are... are we going home?

43:52.069 --> 43:54.560
<i>I hoped I was right</i>
<i>about T.C. Changing his mind.</i>

43:54.638 --> 43:55.900
<i>We were heading for the roof,</i>

43:55.973 --> 43:59.033
<i>and there weren't too many</i>
<i>healthy ways of getting off it.</i>

44:12.389 --> 44:15.517
T.C., we've been up here
a long time, man.

44:15.926 --> 44:19.123
Man, I just know that
Thomas is in that building.

44:22.966 --> 44:24.627
Come on. Come on.

44:25.736 --> 44:26.998
Come on.

44:53.397 --> 44:55.297
There he is!
Look, I see him.

44:55.366 --> 44:57.095
Hey! There's my Thomas.

44:58.902 --> 45:01.894
T.C.,
get down here!

45:02.272 --> 45:04.297
Here we come, baby.

45:32.703 --> 45:35.171
Sometimes
I hate being right.

46:06.503 --> 46:08.027
Hold your fire.

46:44.908 --> 46:46.603
Thomas!

46:48.779 --> 46:50.144
Thomas!

47:10.300 --> 47:12.029
It's a good thing
you came along.

47:12.102 --> 47:14.036
All I needed was
an extra 20 pounds.

47:14.104 --> 47:15.901
But I would have
knocked him out, anyway.

47:15.973 --> 47:16.997
Right.

47:17.074 --> 47:20.271
I wonder where they got that
phony Farber, anyway.

47:20.577 --> 47:22.408
How you guys feeling?

47:23.981 --> 47:25.505
I'm getting
a little better,

47:25.582 --> 47:28.073
but I'm just kind of
sore all over.

47:28.185 --> 47:29.982
Oh, you poor thing.

47:30.220 --> 47:33.018
I'll give you an alcohol
rubdown and a massage later.

47:33.090 --> 47:35.422
Oh, that's great.
My back is killing me.

47:35.492 --> 47:37.687
Not you.
She's talking about me, Rick.

47:37.761 --> 47:39.388
You know,
I'm starting to feel like

47:39.463 --> 47:42.193
Harold Farber
in that weird ice machine.

47:42.666 --> 47:43.894
By the way, Virginia,

47:43.967 --> 47:45.867
that's gonna be
a great part in your book.

47:45.936 --> 47:47.403
Would've been a great part.

47:47.471 --> 47:49.462
I'm no longer
writing that book.

47:49.540 --> 47:51.098
Why not?

47:51.174 --> 47:53.005
I only do
autobiographies.

47:53.076 --> 47:56.876
And now that everyone knows
Harold Farber is dead,

47:57.514 --> 47:59.641
it's obvious
he can't write his biography.

47:59.716 --> 48:01.775
I've already started
a new book

48:01.852 --> 48:03.046
on Magnum.

48:05.389 --> 48:06.686
Now, who'd wanna buy

48:06.757 --> 48:10.454
a book about a second-rate
Sherlock Holmes like Thomas Magnum?

48:10.527 --> 48:11.858
Virginia.

48:12.029 --> 48:13.291
Yes, Thomas?

48:13.363 --> 48:15.024
Did I ever tell you
about the time...

48:15.098 --> 48:16.087
Thomas!

48:16.166 --> 48:19.567
...that Rick met this
wonderful girl in Bangkok.
