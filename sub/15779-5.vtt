00:01.000 --> 00:04.120
Hey kids,
it's time for adventure

00:04.250 --> 00:07.380
at Rusty's Day Camp
For Boy Adventurers--

00:07.500 --> 00:09.290
The largest privately run day camp...

00:09.420 --> 00:11.460
for budding super
scientists in the area.

00:11.590 --> 00:14.720
Learn adventuring from
pros like action Johnny...

00:14.840 --> 00:17.220
Master Billy Quiz-boy,
and of course me...

00:17.350 --> 00:21.060
Rusty Venture, star
of the Rusty Venture cartoon.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.430
Tell mom you need excitement.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.690
Tell dad you need a cashier's check.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.690
And we'll see you there.

00:26.810 --> 00:31.730
At Rusty's Day Camp For Boy Adventurers!

00:34.240 --> 00:36.740
Makes me feel warm and fuzzy...

00:36.870 --> 00:38.870
just trying to give
back to the fans that made me.

00:38.990 --> 00:42.120
These kids paid $200 bucks
a head to get in here...

00:42.250 --> 00:44.960
and then you charge the another
20 to get their picture taken...

00:45.080 --> 00:46.460
with a cardboard cutout.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.540
I'm not sure that qualifies
as "giving back."

00:49.670 --> 00:50.790
Alright, keep it down.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.090
I don't want my fans to know
how mean you are to their hero.

00:53.210 --> 00:56.880
That's right, it's Rusty Venture!

00:57.010 --> 00:58.300
When do we eat, Sam?

00:58.430 --> 01:01.760
We wouldn't stopped for a cruller
if we knew you were gonna starve us.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.180
Oh, those are underrated.

01:03.310 --> 01:06.270
There are fully stocked vending machines
right next to the gift shack.

01:06.390 --> 01:09.610
Why don't you two get yourself
an eight-dollar bag of combos?

01:09.730 --> 01:10.650
Whew!

01:10.770 --> 01:12.780
Wowzie, some people
just shouldn't breed.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.320
Those are some ugly kids.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.780
Kids? You're kidding, right?

01:15.900 --> 01:17.700
They're achondroplastic dwarves.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.530
And they're almost
as good as you or I...

01:19.660 --> 01:21.700
and they deserve this camp
as much as any other kid here.

01:21.830 --> 01:22.870
Such a racist.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.540
- They're not really a race, Doc.
- Will you listen to yourself, Hitler.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.250
Well, not really a Boy Adventurer.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.540
Well, why are you even here?

01:30.670 --> 01:32.130
Because you have a big head?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.300
Hey! All celebrities have large heads.

01:34.420 --> 01:35.960
You ever see Christina Ricci
in real life?

01:36.090 --> 01:37.010
So what are you?

01:37.130 --> 01:38.930
I'm a Quiz Boy.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.800
It's a seriously underrated
branch of boy genius.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.140
Quiz boy?

01:43.260 --> 01:44.930
You don't really look like a little kid.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.310
Come on. OK, fine, I'm 35 years old.
You happy?

01:48.440 --> 01:51.150
I'm neither Boy, nor Adventurer. Brilliant.

01:51.270 --> 01:55.110
You. You solved the case of
"Let's hurt the unpaid volunteer's feelings."

01:55.240 --> 01:56.150
Pretty smart kid.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.490
You know what you're gonna be?

01:57.610 --> 02:01.160
I'm gonna be a Boy Adventurer
like Rusty Venture!

02:01.280 --> 02:04.330
What is "wrong"!
You, my friend, are gonna be a Quiz Boy!

02:04.450 --> 02:05.410
No, I won't.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.910
I'll take "yes you are" for 50 points.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.580
We can't all be famous Adventurers.

02:10.710 --> 02:14.170
That doesn't mean you have to be out
of the adventure game altogether.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.840
You mean, become a super villain?

02:15.960 --> 02:17.510
Shiver me timbers, no!

02:17.630 --> 02:20.010
I'm talking about the rubber mask set.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.510
The little guys.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.430
Do we get to wear cool costumes?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.970
You bet you do!

02:25.100 --> 02:28.600
If you run a museum
you get yourself a glowing suit of armor.

02:28.730 --> 02:31.150
You wanna protect your gold
from meddling kids...

02:31.270 --> 02:33.690
you might try a ghost miner 49er.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.610
Look at me. I look like Johnny Depp!

02:37.400 --> 02:38.690
Oh, and that's not all.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.950
Sometimes you get to hang out with
people who were famous once, like Cher...

02:43.070 --> 02:45.700
and the guy that did the voice
for Inspector Gadget!

02:45.830 --> 02:46.740
What are you guys doing?

02:46.870 --> 02:48.370
You're on monarch time!

02:48.500 --> 02:50.460
You snack off the clock!

02:50.580 --> 02:53.130
Wait, see if they have that in a medium.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.170
That's hilarious.

02:54.290 --> 02:57.210
Honey, have you seen
Tim-Tom and Kevin?

02:57.340 --> 02:58.300
Your Murderous Moppets?

02:58.420 --> 03:00.130
I sent them out on a... thing.

03:00.260 --> 03:03.510
Monarch, you're not arching
Dr. Venture in there, are you?

03:03.640 --> 03:05.390
What? No, no, sweetie.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.060
This is reconnaissance work...

03:07.180 --> 03:09.020
Pr-preemptive Arching.

03:09.140 --> 03:10.730
Isn't that just arching?

03:10.850 --> 03:14.060
Well, maybe if you're
retarded it-- man of manatee!

03:14.190 --> 03:17.400
- Where did you get that number?
- You like it?

03:17.530 --> 03:21.280
It's a prototype for my
Dr. Mrs. The Monarch costume.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.780
I don't want to be picky...

03:22.910 --> 03:24.910
but you're gonna trip on those wings.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.490
And aren't you a little afraid
that your cupcakes might slide out?

03:27.620 --> 03:28.830
Whatever, they're taped.

03:28.950 --> 03:31.580
I'm more worried
that it makes my ass look chunky.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.250
Oh dear...

03:33.370 --> 03:38.920
Come here, sit on your king's
ever expanding throne.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.340
What is that?

03:40.470 --> 03:43.260
No doubt a recruitment
facility cleverly disguised...

03:43.380 --> 03:45.840
as like, the gayest day camp ever.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.600
What's that? It's huge!

03:48.720 --> 03:49.850
It can't be a kid.

03:49.970 --> 03:51.390
Dean, that's a teenager.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.810
But...but, we don't look like that.
Oh, crap! He's coming over here.

03:54.940 --> 03:56.060
I-I gotta go.

03:56.190 --> 03:58.190
Dude, what is your problem?

03:59.320 --> 04:00.530
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.860
Your mom make you come
to this loser con, too?

04:02.990 --> 04:03.990
I don't have a mommy.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.610
So what, I don't have a dad.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.240
He was in black ops. Probably
went undercover to kill somebody.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.950
Hey, what was that nerdy kid's problem?

04:10.080 --> 04:13.540
That's my brother, Dean. He's never seen
another teenage boy before.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.209
Hey, how many of you
got fathers out there?

04:16.329 --> 04:17.880
Show of hands.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.670
You! Why is your hand not up, man?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.050
What? No father?

04:22.170 --> 04:23.630
You don't look like Jesus, bro.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.640
My daddy died while I was sleeping.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.140
Oh, well, you had a father...

04:28.260 --> 04:29.970
and now you're fuckin' free, man.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.140
Let's go! Come on!

04:31.270 --> 04:32.890
I wanna see all those hands up!

04:33.020 --> 04:35.980
Oh, wait, Action Johnny's hand isn't up.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.520
Why is that?

04:37.650 --> 04:39.900
Does he not have a father?

04:40.020 --> 04:42.990
No! Fathers are caring and protective men.

04:43.110 --> 04:46.410
And I don't have one of those.
No. No, but who cares?

04:46.530 --> 04:49.160
Who cares, who cares,
who cares, who cares! !

04:49.280 --> 04:51.830
Maybe I did kill the dog.

04:51.950 --> 04:56.580
Maybe I was the lizard man
that stole your precious serum.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.960
You loved that serum
more than you loved me.

05:00.090 --> 05:04.260
Father!

05:05.380 --> 05:07.180
I liked him better when he was strung out.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.390
Poor bastard.
I can't believe you got him to do this.

05:10.510 --> 05:11.890
I know. You should read his rider.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.180
He requested 20 bars
of Lever 2000, one bottle of Crystal...

05:15.310 --> 05:18.060
one bottle of Dom Perignon,
and two cases of Tropicana Twisters.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.900
Right. Who was that, Van Halen?

05:21.020 --> 05:23.110
No, that was Sean Puffy Combs Daddy.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.240
Hey, Pop, can I show
my new friend my bedroom?

05:25.360 --> 05:27.240
I've never had a friend in there.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.870
Ya know, Pop, I've never even had a friend.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.530
Hank! Stop calling me "Pop"!

05:31.660 --> 05:33.490
If these kids find out that their hero
has had sex...

05:33.620 --> 05:34.540
their heads will explode.

05:34.660 --> 05:35.580
But I want to show my new--

05:35.710 --> 05:38.710
This isn't all about you, Hank.
These kids want to see Rusty Venture.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.790
Maybe when there's a cartoon
called The Venture Brothers...

05:41.920 --> 05:43.090
it'll be different.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.880
Hey Hank, I could sure use
your help with my judo class.

05:47.010 --> 05:50.260
I can't do it without your ukemi.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.760
I'll go change into my Gi!

05:53.770 --> 05:55.060
Smooth, Doc.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.680
Wait till you have kids of your own.

05:58.770 --> 06:00.730
Killing Blackulas with a sword is cool.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.730
But do you know what's really cool?

06:02.860 --> 06:03.770
Safety!

06:03.900 --> 06:05.150
The Order Of The Triad...

06:05.280 --> 06:08.320
has a lot
of strange and dangerous enemies.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.240
Enemies of safety!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.820
One of our enemies is invisible!

06:12.950 --> 06:16.120
And he can enter any home
through the ground.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.750
He's in your home now...

06:17.870 --> 06:19.290
waiting for you in the basement.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.920
His name is Radon!

06:21.040 --> 06:22.710
And he will give you lung cancer.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.750
Lung cancer?

06:23.880 --> 06:25.590
But Al, I don't smoke.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.090
Of course you don't, Jefferson.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.840
Because smoking is more evil
than the hoary Denizens of the underworld.

06:30.970 --> 06:33.600
And if you smoked, we'd know it...

06:33.720 --> 06:36.260
because we have a smoke detector
in every room.

06:36.390 --> 06:38.100
With fresh batteries!

06:38.230 --> 06:42.650
Remember-- if a smoke detector
doesn't work, the silence...

06:42.770 --> 06:44.520
Could be deadly!

06:47.360 --> 06:49.950
- When did we lose them?
- That was my fault.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.240
I really hit them with that Radon part.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.570
We never get to my song!

06:55.240 --> 06:57.740
Alright, you really gotta
pound that hip in there.

06:57.870 --> 07:00.370
Break his balance.
You can't just pull the guy over.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.460
You have to roll him over your hip.

07:02.580 --> 07:03.880
What's that throw called?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.290
That one's called o-goshi.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.920
You mean O-gay-shi.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.710
You guys look like a couple
of bonobo chimps.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.550
- What?
- O-gay-shi...

07:10.680 --> 07:12.720
Somebody pulls
that ridiculous move on me...

07:12.840 --> 07:17.310
I'd land my inside axe kick on their face.
I call it the widow-maker.

07:17.430 --> 07:19.180
If I, like, kick a guy married with it.

07:19.310 --> 07:23.730
Alright. Maybe you wanna come up here
and show us some of your technique.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.480
Yeah, you wish.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.820
Too bad I had to register
my hands and instep...

07:27.940 --> 07:29.320
as lethal weapons.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.820
The friggin' government made me do that.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.740
What are you--

07:32.860 --> 07:34.870
Kid, seriously? Are you for real?

07:34.990 --> 07:36.950
Brock, are your feet registered?

07:37.080 --> 07:39.290
Nobody's are. They don't even do that.

07:39.410 --> 07:40.410
This kid's insane.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.170
Yeah, that's right.
You better walk away...

07:43.290 --> 07:44.500
I'm not going anywhere.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.840
What a-- what are you doing?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.170
Alright junior Adventurers!

07:48.300 --> 07:52.170
Who wants a tour of Rusty's
scientastic facilities?

07:54.930 --> 07:56.550
What was that up there?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.850
That kid was pushing
my buttons hard.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.890
I-I-I wanted to beat on him.

08:01.020 --> 08:03.770
Don't even think about it,
I'm uninsured.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.850
Go cool down.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.020
You look like you're gonna
pop a blood vessel.

08:07.150 --> 08:10.030
Yeah, I don't know what's got into me.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.230
All aboard for fun!

08:11.360 --> 08:12.400
Next stop...

08:12.530 --> 08:14.360
Excitement town!

08:14.490 --> 08:17.870
Don't forget to collect
your free smile from the trolley conductor.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.530
What are you two idiots doing?

08:19.660 --> 08:22.700
Get on that golf cart thing! Now!

08:22.830 --> 08:25.040
Sweetie, calm down. Honestly.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.880
It's a tour of the compound!

08:27.000 --> 08:29.710
That idiot Dr. Venture
is about to open his shirt...

08:29.840 --> 08:31.460
and tell me where to stick the knife!

08:31.590 --> 08:32.760
You're arching.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.220
I'm seizing an opportunity.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.220
Now how do you do
a screen capture?

08:36.340 --> 08:39.429
It's like shift, option--
Oh, crap! I made an umlaut.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.309
Hey, we're gonna use the buddy system.

08:43.429 --> 08:45.230
The person seated next
to you is your buddy.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.060
Say "hi" to your buddy.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.060
Hi, buddy.

08:49.190 --> 08:51.730
If you touch something
that melts your fingers off tell your buddy.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.190
If you get a face
full of burning hydrofluoric acid...

08:54.320 --> 08:57.280
it's your buddy that drags you
to one of the many eyewash stations.

08:57.410 --> 08:58.570
Any questions?

08:58.700 --> 09:00.240
When do we get
to meet Rusty?

09:00.370 --> 09:02.160
I'm Rusty Venture.

09:02.290 --> 09:03.830
Why can't you kids
wrap your heads around that?

09:03.960 --> 09:04.910
What happened?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.750
I left Neverland
so I could marry Wendy.

09:06.870 --> 09:08.670
What do you think happened?
Any good questions?

09:08.790 --> 09:10.540
Yes, the kid that's bigger
than everyone else.

09:10.670 --> 09:11.670
Yeah, it's Pat.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.840
Pat McCrotch.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.170
Yeah, is this gonna suck
the whole time...

09:15.300 --> 09:17.930
or is this the only part that sucks?

09:18.050 --> 09:21.220
I just want to gauge how much suck
I have to friggin sit through.

09:21.350 --> 09:24.180
Any real questions
about the tour?

09:24.310 --> 09:26.100
OK, the blond boy.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.350
Yes, Walter.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.600
Walter Melon.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.980
Is this gonna be doo-doo stupid--

09:31.110 --> 09:32.570
Walter. Walter, is it?

09:32.690 --> 09:36.030
Yes, locked in your room for two weeks
with nothing to eat but potatoes.

09:36.150 --> 09:37.200
And no car, ever.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.610
- What does that have to do--
- Oh, what?

09:38.740 --> 09:40.620
I'm sorry, I thought you
asked me how long your father...

09:40.740 --> 09:42.030
is going to punish you.

09:42.160 --> 09:48.370
So anybody that doesn't immediately
give you respect, you murder?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.620
No, no. Well...

09:49.750 --> 09:51.330
I mean, I don't always
kill them or anything.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.630
Just like a bruise or two
as a little reminder.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.340
- I mean... until this kid.
- Just talk to him.

09:57.470 --> 10:00.800
When you treat a young man like
an adult, he acts like an adult.

10:00.930 --> 10:02.930
If he was an adult, I'd kick his ass.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.760
You can't stoop to their level.

10:04.890 --> 10:09.230
Yeah, that's the tr--
but another kid could, right?

10:09.350 --> 10:11.560
No, I know where you are going with this.

10:11.690 --> 10:15.030
Yeah, I could get another kid
to beat him down.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.360
- Not even close.
- Don't bother. I'm not listening.

10:19.490 --> 10:22.450
- Who do I make this out to?
- Dean.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.120
Wait, you're not one
of the Venture twins, are you?

10:25.240 --> 10:26.700
My dad told me so say "no" to that.

10:26.830 --> 10:30.790
Look, kid, I have a plane
parked right over there.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.420
You say the word
and we are outta here, man.

10:33.540 --> 10:34.670
You don't need to live like this.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.000
- Dean?
- Here.

10:36.130 --> 10:37.210
Just say the word--

10:37.340 --> 10:39.090
What are you doing, Jon?
Leave the kid alone.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.680
Just signing one of my baby
pictures, Samson.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.680
"Action Johnny"

10:44.810 --> 10:46.010
Hey, Dean, you wanna come with me.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.180
I need a favor.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.680
Just say the word, man!

10:49.810 --> 10:51.350
The E-Den!

10:51.480 --> 10:54.690
A fully enclosed,
self sustaining biological environment.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.690
Designed to prepare a single
male and female astronaut...

10:57.820 --> 10:59.940
for long term,
space station inhabitancy.

11:00.070 --> 11:01.660
Why is it so dirty?

11:01.780 --> 11:03.370
My father died before he taught me to care.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.490
Alright, Billy, wanna give me
a hand with this door?

11:07.370 --> 11:10.160
It's rusted shut.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.670
When was the last time
you opened this?

11:11.790 --> 11:14.580
The project was abandoned
40 years ago.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.710
Maybe it's a push door.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.300
Are you pulling or pushing?

11:18.420 --> 11:20.720
Huh, thought it would be empty...

11:20.840 --> 11:23.550
with, like, a plaque that says
how wonderful my dad was.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.600
Alright, hands in pockets.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.720
I don't care how soft something looks
there's no putting your lips on anything.

11:28.850 --> 11:31.690
This place smells like
a hamper in a hippie's commune.

11:31.810 --> 11:32.770
It's spooky.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.480
Hey, don't touch that!

11:34.610 --> 11:36.400
It will make you sterile.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.070
Wh-what is that?

11:41.530 --> 11:42.990
OK, kids.

11:43.110 --> 11:45.570
So... The E-Den.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.780
A self contained--

11:46.910 --> 11:49.080
We probably should get
back to the camp grounds.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.330
Arts and crafts--

11:53.870 --> 11:56.130
It's OK, I've talked
to a gorilla before.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.340
I know their language.

11:57.460 --> 12:01.420
Koko, fine animal person gorilla.

12:01.550 --> 12:04.510
Brows drink polite nipple there hurry.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.930
Frown bad!

12:06.050 --> 12:08.140
Billy! Billy, I need a kitten!

12:08.260 --> 12:11.310
- Why do you need a kitten?
- They like kittens.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.810
Don't move, they can smell fear!

12:12.940 --> 12:15.440
- Can they smell urine?
- It's like liquid fear!

12:15.560 --> 12:17.400
I pretty much knew
this was gonna happen.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.320
That's why I keep this
sweet Betty ready to play.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.530
The SMK Westlake S2.

12:22.650 --> 12:25.860
Cool beans. Is that a BB gun?

12:25.990 --> 12:28.120
Pellet, douche! Spring firing!

12:28.240 --> 12:31.790
Like I need a CO2 cartridge
going off in my pants.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.160
Mr. Action has just joined the server...

12:34.290 --> 12:38.290
Meow...I'm a pretty kitten, meow.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.750
This isn't working and I don't
know why you think it would!

12:40.880 --> 12:42.300
Oh! Son of a bitch!

12:45.340 --> 12:46.340
Tour's over, kids!

12:46.470 --> 12:48.220
Everybody out!

12:49.930 --> 12:50.890
Harder.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.140
Like, as hard as you can.

12:53.270 --> 12:55.520
Start with your shoulders and snap it.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.520
Try to punch behind my hand.

12:58.730 --> 13:00.610
Come on, Dean, at least
keep your wrist straight.

13:00.730 --> 13:03.070
- Where's your brother?
- He went on dad's tour.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.860
- Doc.
- What!

13:04.990 --> 13:05.990
Is Hank with you?

13:06.110 --> 13:07.160
Hold on...

13:07.280 --> 13:08.320
- Yes, Hank is alive.
- What?

13:08.450 --> 13:10.330
- Look, Brock, I gotta go.
- Yeah, alright.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.870
Hey, we have that
demonstration thing at five.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.790
- And could you tell Hank tha--
- Yes, bye!

13:14.910 --> 13:16.660
Let me out! It's me! Let me out!

13:16.790 --> 13:21.250
- Are you alone?
- Yes! Let me out! Now!

13:22.420 --> 13:25.090
OK! Everybody back
on the people mover. Come on!

13:25.220 --> 13:27.010
This is a fun day camp!

13:27.130 --> 13:28.760
I jettisoned the hand. Got away.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.430
I wasn't alone in there. We lost one.

13:31.930 --> 13:32.850
Well, where was his buddy?

13:32.970 --> 13:34.350
He had a buddy! They all had buddies!

13:34.480 --> 13:37.270
Rusty... I saw a little kid
get disemboweled.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.020
You always wanted to be an Adventurer.

13:39.150 --> 13:42.190
Not like answering trivia, is it, boy?

13:42.320 --> 13:43.860
OK, this is what's gonna happen.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.740
I'm gonna tell the kids
that the ape was a guy in a costume...

13:46.860 --> 13:48.490
and never speak of this again.

13:48.610 --> 13:49.700
Now give me that shoe.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.990
How did you work with those
two idiots all those years?

13:54.120 --> 13:56.160
I can't believe they missed the tour!
Will you look at them...

13:56.290 --> 13:58.330
You can't just send my Moppets out

13:58.460 --> 14:00.380
to arch your former enemy.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.250
I put our name in with the Guild,
and we'll be getting--

14:04.380 --> 14:05.880
I don't wanna hate just anybody.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.170
I wanna hate Venture.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.930
Oh, here we go again.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.180
Shh-shh! Wait!

14:10.300 --> 14:11.220
This should be good.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.970
A hit, huh...

14:13.100 --> 14:14.810
You want us to make him suffer...

14:14.930 --> 14:17.560
or just end it quick and quiet like?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.230
No, no, nothing permanent.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.560
Just, like, give him a little taste of fear.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.730
And I guess you could
break something small...

14:24.860 --> 14:25.820
like a toe.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.110
- We could take out his tongue.
- With a knife.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.320
- Or remove his heart?
- Yeah, with a knife.

14:30.450 --> 14:33.160
- A bigger knife.
- Fucking knife!

14:33.280 --> 14:36.160
Yeah, you guys are, uh--

14:36.290 --> 14:37.620
you're kinda creepy.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.420
I think this may be a stupid idea.

14:40.540 --> 14:41.920
Yeah, hey, uh, Monarch.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.420
You wanna call
the spooky twins home...

14:43.540 --> 14:45.340
before I throw them there?

14:45.460 --> 14:46.500
Ahh! Crap!

14:46.630 --> 14:48.840
- He can't see you.
- Get down!

14:48.970 --> 14:51.130
Oh, and Doc really
misses you idiots.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.680
I'm pretty sure he cries
himself to sleep at night.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.760
- He does?
- Yeah.

14:54.890 --> 14:55.850
Really?

14:55.970 --> 14:59.520
Now when I come out,
you guys yell, "ghost!"

14:59.640 --> 15:01.440
Why don't we get to be ghosts?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.650
We have actual ghost experience.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.110
It's a waste of good magic.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.610
I have only the one sea ghost costume.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.280
And you would not believe
how many pirate costumes I have.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.820
Sorry I'm late. OK, where's Doc?

15:12.950 --> 15:14.280
I want to get this out of the way.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.950
It says in the program...

15:17.080 --> 15:20.000
"Action Johnny and special guest star."

15:20.120 --> 15:23.120
Johnny don't like "and special" anything!

15:23.250 --> 15:24.290
Failures!

15:24.420 --> 15:25.880
Both of you! Failures!

15:26.000 --> 15:28.210
I can't even send you out
for the simplest mission.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.720
It's like you were trying to fail me!

15:30.840 --> 15:32.470
Was that the hover tank?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.590
Great, Sgt. Hatred.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.640
I can't even watch.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.640
This is worse than seeing
you with another man!

15:37.770 --> 15:39.770
Hey, that was not my idea.

15:39.890 --> 15:41.480
I thought it would turn me on.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.350
But it was just double
the embarrassment.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.270
- Boo!
- Aahh!

15:46.400 --> 15:48.190
Whoa, not too jumpy pants.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.570
Who did you think I was?

15:49.690 --> 15:52.820
Sorry, I thought you were
Hank's new giant boy friend.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.360
So Hank's finally out?

15:54.490 --> 15:56.780
He thinks that Dermott kid
is the kitty's pajamas...

15:56.910 --> 15:59.580
and he is, in fact, very rude.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.250
You're pretty cute sometimes.

16:01.370 --> 16:03.160
And you're the most--

16:03.290 --> 16:04.870
You two girls talking
about your periods?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.090
Don't let us men
disturb your tea party.

16:07.210 --> 16:10.420
I'm sure Silent Sally has some
sweet makeup tips for ya.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.760
Oh, and here's another one--

16:13.880 --> 16:16.470
Keep your seatbelt on at all times.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.010
Thanks, Brock.
These loafers have leather soles.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.060
Italian.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.310
Where were you?

16:22.430 --> 16:23.810
I was cooking
something up in the lab.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.440
We've been keeping the crowd
waiting with safety tips.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.230
Action Johnny!

16:28.360 --> 16:30.900
Come give your Uncle Z a hug.

16:31.030 --> 16:34.400
What is this shit?
What is this shit man?

16:34.530 --> 16:36.200
Is this some kind of a joke?

16:36.320 --> 16:38.620
Did my father send you?

16:38.740 --> 16:39.950
Did he...

16:40.910 --> 16:43.080
Keep him off of me!
He's all kinds of crazy.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.870
Brock, go cool Johnny off.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.830
Get him a Zima or something.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.540
Oh, God, oh God!

16:48.670 --> 16:52.380
Come now, Dr. Venture,
you told me it would be all cool.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.760
Then I get here and Johnny's wired.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.550
Yes, Dr. Venture!

16:56.680 --> 17:00.260
Wired like a time bomb
attached to a killer whale!

17:00.390 --> 17:04.060
Set to go off the moment
you try to free yourself...

17:07.980 --> 17:09.150
You never lose it.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.400
Seriously, you told me
Johnny was clean now.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.940
He's been dry for a month.

17:13.069 --> 17:15.030
But he's been downing Xanax
like they were Cheetos.

17:15.150 --> 17:16.069
He'll be fine.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.280
Just get in your little
helicopter and do a few passes.

17:18.410 --> 17:20.319
OK. Can I shoot at him?

17:20.450 --> 17:21.410
I don't think so.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.829
How 'bout scorpions?

17:22.950 --> 17:24.790
Can I drop scorpions on him?

17:24.910 --> 17:28.920
I bet that foreign guy
could totally trounce your dad's lover.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
- Who?
- Your dad's lover in the bunny suit.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.800
The one who picked Action Johnny up
like he was gonna totally hump him.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.550
Dude, do you have any
idea what a dork you are?

17:36.680 --> 17:37.590
I mean, any?

17:37.720 --> 17:41.930
You think you're all hardcore,
but you are so Dave Matthews.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.850
You're lucky you look like a suicide girl...

17:43.970 --> 17:44.890
because of your--

17:45.020 --> 17:46.890
Nobody! That's not how!

17:47.560 --> 17:50.980
Whoa! Silent Sally speaks!

17:51.110 --> 17:54.440
OK, why don't you wait for me naked
while I kick your boyfriend's--

17:56.360 --> 17:58.110
Ow! Come on!

17:58.240 --> 18:00.620
You're very rude! Ahh!

18:00.740 --> 18:02.990
That child is a spinning murdertop.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.740
Are you sure he's your son?

18:04.870 --> 18:06.410
Dean! Stop hitting the--

18:06.910 --> 18:08.580
No, no-- They're kids, they're kids.

18:08.710 --> 18:13.250
Why don't you let them work this out. Yeah.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.880
This is Sgt. Hatred! Your nemesis!

18:18.010 --> 18:21.470
Welcome to flaming hell, Dr. Venture!

18:21.600 --> 18:24.010
Scorch it, boys!

18:24.140 --> 18:26.890
Not now.

18:31.980 --> 18:35.900
Whoa there! Call off your Yeti-mummy!

18:36.030 --> 18:37.990
Ahh, he's murdering my boy.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.530
This is monkey business!

18:39.660 --> 18:41.950
Brock, that suit is rented!
Stop getting blood on it.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.370
He started it!

18:43.490 --> 18:45.120
You can't just kill my bo--

18:45.240 --> 18:46.540
What's this now?

18:46.660 --> 18:48.620
Come on, Venture.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.210
You gotta get these kids off me.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.840
I got a court order that says
I can't be around these...

18:53.960 --> 18:55.590
sexy little children!

18:55.710 --> 18:58.050
Alright, kids, nice job
vanquishing the villain.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.930
Isn't this the best play you ever saw?

19:01.050 --> 19:02.680
Now go back to your seats.

19:04.510 --> 19:08.310
We got to get on the same page here.

19:08.430 --> 19:11.390
I'm just pulling a Moses
on some shrubs.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.980
It's rock bottom henching.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.980
Well, you can't just barge
in and expect a hug.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.440
I'm running a day camp today.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.690
My patoot.

19:18.820 --> 19:19.860
Says right here--

19:19.990 --> 19:22.950
"Wednesday, 5:30, menace Dr. Venture."

19:23.070 --> 19:24.200
Let me see that.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.030
And I'm sorry about my man Brock.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.790
He's not as good with children as I am
and they're getting to him.

19:28.910 --> 19:32.250
OK, here's your problem, 5:30 a.m.... a.m.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.330
Looks like a fancy "P."

19:34.460 --> 19:36.750
Alright, fine. Malice troop!

19:36.880 --> 19:38.630
Back in the hover tank!

19:38.760 --> 19:39.710
- Private Schwa!
- Sir!

19:39.840 --> 19:42.720
Yeah, ask the gang where
they want to stop for chow.

19:42.840 --> 19:43.760
Sir, yes sir!

19:43.890 --> 19:45.390
I'm thinking a little soup.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.850
See if Au Bon Pain is OK.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.520
So, I'm just gonna tick
this off as an arch.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.520
If you could just sign here.
And there's a little space for comments.

19:55.650 --> 19:59.230
I guess you could say
I was absolutely menacing and--

19:59.360 --> 20:01.610
This bruhaha brings me back!

20:01.740 --> 20:03.990
Get right out of town!

20:04.110 --> 20:06.030
The Doctor Z!

20:06.160 --> 20:08.410
Oh, man, I love your work.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.370
When you had Kassim eaten by what--

20:10.500 --> 20:13.330
A-a-a damn cheetah or something.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.460
The guy kills his own number two.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.170
That is priceless.

20:17.290 --> 20:20.090
The fool! He made his last blunder!

20:20.210 --> 20:22.590
Oh, oh! This guy right here--

20:22.720 --> 20:24.340
Total pro!

20:24.470 --> 20:26.050
Oh, I gotta get a picture!

20:26.180 --> 20:28.760
- Private Tilday!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

20:28.890 --> 20:31.180
Get the surveillance equipment.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.280
Well, I better get
the little guy home.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.820
Keep an eye out for his hand.

20:47.950 --> 20:50.330
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure it'll turn up.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.740
That's my dad!

20:51.870 --> 20:55.670
Thanks for the zombie
self defense lessons, Mr. Samson.

20:55.790 --> 20:58.080
Uh... Have you seen our son, Kyle?

20:58.210 --> 20:59.790
Oh, there you are!

20:59.920 --> 21:01.340
I have your sweet boy here.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
You sure he's okay?

21:03.590 --> 21:05.550
He's limp. And did you--

21:05.680 --> 21:07.050
We shaved his head for the sack race.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.220
Wind resistance.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.800
Yeah, first place.

21:09.930 --> 21:13.060
Then, in Boy Adventurer tradition
we poured victory plasma over him.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.310
Heh, heh. Good fun.

21:14.430 --> 21:15.850
He'll be fine.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.940
- You didn't...
- Oh, please.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.610
You shoulda seen that kid's DNA.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.690
He was a ticking time bomb of cancer.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.280
I cleared that up.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.490
Trust me, they'll thank me
after they re-potty-train him.

21:26.610 --> 21:29.950
Short and Sassy shampoo?
Do they even make that anymore?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.080
Ummm, no, because
you mix Short and Sassy...

21:32.200 --> 21:36.000
with the active ingredient in Certs,
which is Retsyn, you get napalm.

21:36.120 --> 21:39.040
You lather that up,
and it's goodbye to, like, most of your face.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.380
Tsch. That's my mom. I gotta brush.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.960
OK. Hey, Dermott?

21:44.090 --> 21:47.840
Are you gonna call me or
whatever friends do when they're friends?

21:47.970 --> 21:49.050
Yeah, we'll hang.

21:49.180 --> 21:50.640
Shake it sleazy, loser.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.060
Bye bye, loser! Heh heh.

21:53.180 --> 21:56.350
Dermott, sweetie? Did you meet him?

21:56.480 --> 21:57.350
Yeah...he was okay.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.400
You sure he's my real father?

22:27.760 --> 22:28.880
How did we do, mum?

22:29.010 --> 22:30.630
Just as I asked.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.390
My little Moppets
were perfect as always.

22:33.510 --> 22:36.430
Come give your lady a hug.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.390
Mmm, I like the new costume, mum.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.560
I like hugging you in the new costume.
