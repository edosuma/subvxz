02:11.716 --> 02:13.259
You need to drink, child.

02:17.639 --> 02:19.641
And eat.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.688
Isn't there anything else?

02:26.648 --> 02:30.860
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.196
People can't live on grass.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.832
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

02:44.957 --> 02:47.293
they say there are fields of ghost grass

02:47.418 --> 02:50.630
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.174
It murders all other grass.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.718
The Dothraki believe that one day

02:55.843 --> 02:58.930
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.779
It'll get easier.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.526
Khaleesi!

03:53.651 --> 03:55.486
Your hands.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.041
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.544
Master lllyrio has
extended his hospitality.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.337
You'd be more comfortable there.

04:13.463 --> 04:16.214
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.595
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.972
As you wish, Your Grace.

04:24.015 --> 04:26.350
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

04:26.476 --> 04:28.644
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.315
What did Ned Stark want you for?

04:33.524 --> 04:35.610
Buying from a slaver?

04:35.735 --> 04:37.653
Selling to one.

04:37.779 --> 04:39.697
Some poachers I caught on my land.

04:41.491 --> 04:45.203
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.163
You can rest assured of that.

05:02.804 --> 05:05.056
<i>_</i>

05:12.063 --> 05:14.440
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.280
My mother's been looking for you.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.574
We ride for King's Landing today.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.661
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

05:26.786 --> 05:29.121
and offer your sympathies.

05:29.247 --> 05:31.624
What good will my sympathies do them?

05:33.376 --> 05:36.337
None. But it is expected of you.

05:36.462 --> 05:38.381
Your absence has already been noted.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.466
The boy means nothing to me.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.927
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

05:45.263 --> 05:47.056
One word and I'll hit you again.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.766
I'm telling Mother!

05:54.564 --> 05:56.482
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

05:56.607 --> 05:59.402
and tell them how very sorry you are
that you are at their service,

05:59.527 --> 06:02.738
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

06:02.864 --> 06:05.032
You can't...

06:05.157 --> 06:06.617
Do you understand'?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.668
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.712
I hope so.

06:17.837 --> 06:21.132
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

06:24.010 --> 06:27.054
Ah. Time for breakfast.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.273
Bread. And two of those little fish.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.651
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.364
And bacon, burnt black.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.366
- Hyah.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.328
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.667
Is Bran going to die?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.670
Apparently not.

07:03.007 --> 07:06.427
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

07:14.644 --> 07:17.563
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.440
Only the gods know for certain.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.943
All the rest of us can do is pray.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.988
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.782
I still can't believe you're going.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.951
It's ridiculous, even for you.

07:30.076 --> 07:31.786
Where's your sense of wonder?

07:31.911 --> 07:35.998
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

07:36.123 --> 07:38.376
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.587
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.590
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

07:44.715 --> 07:46.592
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.803
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

07:48.928 --> 07:50.721
and piss off the edge of the world.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.809
The children don't need to hear your filth.

07:56.769 --> 07:58.479
Come.

08:04.735 --> 08:08.280
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.866
Give me a good, clean death any day.

08:12.284 --> 08:15.746
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.624
Death is so final, whereas life...

08:18.749 --> 08:20.918
ah, life is full of possibilities.

08:22.253 --> 08:26.549
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.928
My dear brother,

08:31.053 --> 08:33.722
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.975
My dear brother, you wound me.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.561
You know how much
I love my family.

08:57.997 --> 08:59.123
Please.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.543
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.962
This is your home. I'm your guest.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.342
Handsome one, isn't he?

09:11.052 --> 09:15.598
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.600
He was a fighter too -

09:17.725 --> 09:19.810
tried to beat the fever that took him.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.898
Forgive me.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.900
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

09:26.025 --> 09:28.027
I never knew.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.029
It was years ago.

09:31.447 --> 09:35.034
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

09:35.159 --> 09:38.496
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.503
The boy looked just like him.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.006
Such a little thing.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.218
A bird without feathers.

09:55.096 --> 09:57.389
They came to take his body away

09:58.390 --> 10:02.144
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.193
That little bundle.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.405
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

10:13.531 --> 10:15.866
Never have visited the crypt, never.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.504
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

10:28.629 --> 10:30.756
that she return your child to you.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.593
I am grateful.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.513
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.650
A sword for the Wall?

11:32.860 --> 11:35.863
- I already have one.
- Good man.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.657
- Have you swung it yet'?
- Of course I have.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.284
At someone, I mean.

11:44.955 --> 11:48.417
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

11:48.542 --> 11:51.712
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

11:51.837 --> 11:54.632
and some bone to keep it all standing.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.011
Let me thank you ahead of time

11:59.136 --> 12:01.889
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

12:02.014 --> 12:04.516
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

12:06.769 --> 12:10.773
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.986
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

12:19.073 --> 12:21.242
Is it "we" already'?

12:22.868 --> 12:24.203
Have you taken your vows, then?

12:24.328 --> 12:25.704
Soon enough.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.376
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

12:30.501 --> 12:34.546
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

12:36.048 --> 12:38.008
it's only for life.

12:57.403 --> 12:59.405
Thank you, Nymeria.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.164
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

13:09.290 --> 13:12.001
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

13:12.126 --> 13:15.087
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.381
It's good you've got help.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.091
Watch.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.135
Nymeria, gloves.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.518
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.603
Nymeria, gloves!

13:33.897 --> 13:35.774
I have something for you.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.235
And it has to be packed very carefully.

13:38.902 --> 13:39.945
A present?

13:40.070 --> 13:42.031
Close the door.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.920
This is no toy.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.426
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.389
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.559
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.894
It won't hack a man's head off,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.896
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.690
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.610
How does it feel?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.821
Do you like the balance?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.448
I think so.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.327
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.329
I know which end to use.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.878
I'm going to miss you.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.839
Careful.

14:52.226 --> 14:55.020
All the best swords have names, you know.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.317
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.987
I've got a needle of my own.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.838
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.589
You've said it.

15:33.475 --> 15:36.311
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.151
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.610
I'm taking the black.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.372
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

15:55.497 --> 15:59.126
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.755
I'll know my way around by then.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.216
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

16:11.430 --> 16:14.308
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.867
I want you...

16:31.992 --> 16:33.660
to leave.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.930
17 years ago

17:35.055 --> 17:37.474
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

17:39.851 --> 17:43.021
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.234
And now you're leaving again.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.697
I have no choice.

17:51.822 --> 17:55.701
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

17:55.826 --> 17:59.162
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.166
You do have a choice.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.836
And you've made it.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.925
Cat...

18:17.014 --> 18:19.474
I can't do it, Ned.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.396
I really can't.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.981
You can.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.693
You must.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.011
You've said goodbye to Bran'?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.138
He's not going to die. I know it.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.432
You Starks are hard to kill.

19:01.516 --> 19:02.976
My mother?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.646
- She was very kind.
- Good.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.650
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.860
It was always my color.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.821
Farewell, Snow.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.573
And you, Stark.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.128
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.758
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

20:17.801 --> 20:19.678
And you are a Stark.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.888
You might not have my name,

20:22.013 --> 20:24.015
but you have my blood.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.649
Is my mother alive?

20:33.358 --> 20:36.945
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

20:37.988 --> 20:39.656
Does she care?

20:40.991 --> 20:43.952
The next time we see each other,

20:44.077 --> 20:46.121
we'll talk about your mother.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.998
Hmm?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.583
I promise.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.167
Gods, this is country!

21:34.211 --> 21:37.464
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.927
I've half a mind to go with you.

21:42.052 --> 21:46.765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

21:46.890 --> 21:50.185
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.979
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.857
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

21:55.982 --> 21:58.235
we never had the chance to be young.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.986
I recall a few chances.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.493
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

22:06.618 --> 22:08.537
That common girl of yours?

22:08.662 --> 22:11.456
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.792
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.587
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.297
And her tits.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.759
Yours was, er... Aleena?

22:22.884 --> 22:25.762
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl'?

22:25.887 --> 22:27.848
Your bastard's mother?

22:29.641 --> 22:31.810
- Wylla.
- That's it.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.020
She must have been a rare wench

22:34.145 --> 22:37.023
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.192
You never told me what she looked like.

22:40.277 --> 22:41.486
Nor will I.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.991
We were at war.

22:46.116 --> 22:48.910
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.038
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

22:54.124 --> 22:57.210
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

22:57.335 --> 23:00.672
The worst thing about your coronation -

23:00.797 --> 23:02.799
I'll never get to hit you again.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.596
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.602
There was a rider in the night.

23:19.733 --> 23:23.194
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.155
What of it'? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

23:25.280 --> 23:27.574
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

23:27.699 --> 23:29.701
and a bold man to wield it.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.620
She's little more than a child.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.752
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

23:38.877 --> 23:42.172
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.591
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

23:44.716 --> 23:46.718
the woman I loved.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.888
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.973
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.684
This Khal Drogo,

23:54.809 --> 23:56.686
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.564
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

23:59.689 --> 24:02.275
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.361
They have no ships, Robert.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.447
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

24:08.615 --> 24:12.285
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

24:12.410 --> 24:15.080
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

24:16.665 --> 24:19.918
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

24:25.006 --> 24:27.008
There's a war coming, Ned.

24:28.176 --> 24:31.262
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

24:31.388 --> 24:32.847
but it's coming.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.671
Sit.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.548
You'll be fed.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.345
Untie them.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.682
Ah, rapers.

25:59.893 --> 26:03.646
They were given a choice, no doubt-
castration or the Wall.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.024
Most choose the knife.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.573
Not impressed by your new brothers?

26:16.576 --> 26:18.328
Lovely thing about the Watch -

26:18.453 --> 26:21.748
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.634
Why do you read so much'?

26:32.759 --> 26:35.887
Look at me and tell me what you see.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.099
Is this a trick?

26:40.350 --> 26:42.936
What you see is a dwarf.

26:43.061 --> 26:46.231
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

26:46.356 --> 26:50.485
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.570
Things are expected of me.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.115
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.283
Until your brother killed that king.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.793
Yes, until my brother killed him.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.381
Life is full of these little ironies.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.135
My sister married the new king, and...

27:15.260 --> 27:17.720
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.601
I must do my part for the honor of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

27:25.436 --> 27:27.313
But how?

27:27.438 --> 27:30.191
Well, my brother has his sword

27:30.316 --> 27:31.609
and I have my mind,

27:31.734 --> 27:35.738
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

27:35.864 --> 27:38.533
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.455
And you?

27:44.581 --> 27:46.708
What's your story, bastard?

27:49.002 --> 27:51.880
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

27:55.967 --> 27:58.720
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

27:58.845 --> 28:03.266
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

28:04.058 --> 28:07.187
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

28:07.312 --> 28:08.938
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

28:09.063 --> 28:12.400
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

28:12.525 --> 28:16.029
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.448
You're a smart boy.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.992
You don't believe that nonsense.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.461
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

29:06.037 --> 29:10.041
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

29:10.166 --> 29:13.962
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.465
Talk to Poole about it.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.720
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

29:24.138 --> 29:25.348
We need a new steward,

29:25.473 --> 29:28.559
and there are several other
appointments that require

29:28.685 --> 29:32.563
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

29:33.856 --> 29:35.817
I'll make the appointments.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.571
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.699
Very good, my lord.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.411
My lady.

29:59.549 --> 30:01.759
When was the last time you left this room?

30:03.094 --> 30:04.345
I have to take care of him.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.180
He's not going to die, Mother.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.099
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.267
What if he's wrong?

30:09.392 --> 30:12.812
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.648
He's six.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.985
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

30:19.110 --> 30:21.404
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

30:21.529 --> 30:23.531
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

30:27.452 --> 30:28.911
Fire.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.165
You stay here. I'll come back.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.393
You're not supposed to be here.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.146
No one is supposed to be here.

30:55.646 --> 30:57.523
It's a mercy.

30:57.648 --> 30:59.484
He's dead already.

31:01.444 --> 31:02.987
No!

32:10.138 --> 32:13.808
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.769
Everywhere? Even in the East?

32:16.894 --> 32:19.897
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.942
- It is known.
- It is known.

32:23.067 --> 32:26.946
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.198
The moon?

32:29.323 --> 32:31.951
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

32:32.076 --> 32:34.620
that once there were two moons in the sky.

32:34.745 --> 32:38.666
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

32:38.791 --> 32:41.752
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

32:41.878 --> 32:43.713
and they drank the sun's fire.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.799
Moon is no egg.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.677
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.346
- It is known.
- It is known.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.766
Leave me with her.

33:04.066 --> 33:07.653
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

33:07.778 --> 33:10.323
Men like to talk when they're happy.

33:10.448 --> 33:14.494
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.829
How old were you?

33:16.954 --> 33:19.499
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

33:19.624 --> 33:21.209
Nine?!

33:21.334 --> 33:25.254
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

33:25.379 --> 33:28.216
First you must learn.

33:31.385 --> 33:34.555
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy'?

33:35.973 --> 33:37.725
Yes.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.602
Will it take three years?

33:41.687 --> 33:42.688
No.

34:04.460 --> 34:05.836
Welcome.

35:36.886 --> 35:40.306
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

35:41.891 --> 35:44.393
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.647
I think he was thrown.

35:49.106 --> 35:51.734
The boy was always
surefooted before.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.695
Someone tried to kill him twice.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.657
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

35:57.782 --> 36:00.451
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.204
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

36:04.664 --> 36:07.041
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

36:07.166 --> 36:10.461
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

36:10.586 --> 36:12.797
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

36:12.922 --> 36:15.216
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

36:15.341 --> 36:18.594
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.554
Someone gave it to him.

36:21.806 --> 36:25.559
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

36:25.685 --> 36:27.144
If it's war they want...

36:27.269 --> 36:29.438
If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.692
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

36:32.817 --> 36:34.318
Hmm?

36:34.443 --> 36:37.405
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

36:37.530 --> 36:39.532
We don't know the truth yet.

36:40.116 --> 36:41.992
Lord Stark must be told of this.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.912
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.914
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.209
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.128
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.796
I must.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.508
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

36:57.633 --> 37:00.094
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.346
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.973
Let me accompany you at least.

37:04.098 --> 37:07.101
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.232
What about Bran?

37:14.942 --> 37:17.820
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

37:19.155 --> 37:22.408
Bran's life is in their hands now.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.260
No, Khaleesi.

38:23.385 --> 38:26.222
You must look in his eyes always.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.432
Love comes in at the eyes.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.853
It is said that lrogenia of Lys
could finish a man

38:32.978 --> 38:34.814
with nothing but her eyes.

38:34.939 --> 38:37.149
Finish a man?

38:38.734 --> 38:40.903
Oh.

38:42.071 --> 38:45.616
Kings traveled across the world
for a night with lrogenia.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.369
Magisters sold their palaces.

38:48.494 --> 38:51.914
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

38:52.957 --> 38:55.584
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

38:55.709 --> 38:58.754
and she refused them all.

38:58.879 --> 39:02.091
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

39:02.216 --> 39:03.884
I... I don't think

39:04.009 --> 39:06.470
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.848
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.016
Men want what they've never had.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.478
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.857
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

39:28.868 --> 39:31.370
Then don't make love like a slave.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.339
Very good, Khaleesi.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.466
Out there he is the mighty khal,

39:45.134 --> 39:48.470
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

39:49.263 --> 39:50.681
I... I don't think

39:50.806 --> 39:53.309
that this is the Dothraki way.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.477
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

39:56.312 --> 39:58.439
why did he marry you?

40:46.904 --> 40:48.238
No.

40:52.201 --> 40:53.702
No!

40:55.746 --> 40:58.707
Tonight I would look upon your face!

42:45.689 --> 42:47.107
Pardon me, ser.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.238
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

42:54.990 --> 42:57.826
Or is it him there making you shake?

42:58.660 --> 43:00.370
He frightens me too.

43:00.496 --> 43:02.998
Look at that face.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.667
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

43:12.508 --> 43:13.467
Why won't he speak to me?

43:13.592 --> 43:16.553
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.640
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

43:19.765 --> 43:22.518
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

43:22.643 --> 43:26.105
Ser llyn Payne, the King's Justice.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.733
The Royal Executioner.

43:31.610 --> 43:34.196
What is it, sweet lady?

43:35.864 --> 43:38.117
Does the hound frighten you?

43:38.242 --> 43:39.701
Away with you, dog.

43:40.536 --> 43:42.246
You're scaring my lady.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.583
I don't like to see you upset.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.004
The sun's finally shining.

43:51.839 --> 43:53.674
Come walk with me.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.802
Stay, Lady.

44:13.569 --> 44:15.696
I probably shouldn't have any more.

44:15.821 --> 44:18.115
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.201
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

44:33.755 --> 44:36.383
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

44:37.426 --> 44:39.428
I'll get you!

44:44.725 --> 44:46.393
Arya!

44:46.518 --> 44:47.686
Ow!

44:47.811 --> 44:49.479
What are you doing here?

44:49.605 --> 44:51.607
- Go away.
- Your sister?

44:55.485 --> 44:58.322
- And who are you, boy'?
- Mycah, my lord.

44:58.447 --> 45:00.449
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

45:00.574 --> 45:03.911
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

45:05.704 --> 45:08.332
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

45:08.457 --> 45:11.001
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

45:11.126 --> 45:14.755
I'm your prince, not your lord,

45:14.880 --> 45:18.634
and I said pick up your sword.

45:18.759 --> 45:20.969
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

45:21.094 --> 45:22.930
And you're not a knight.

45:24.306 --> 45:26.516
Only a butcher's boy.

45:26.642 --> 45:29.561
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

45:29.686 --> 45:31.939
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

45:32.606 --> 45:35.150
I won't hurt him...

45:35.275 --> 45:36.276
much.

45:44.868 --> 45:45.994
- Arya!

45:47.120 --> 45:48.413
Filthy little bitch!

45:48.538 --> 45:50.374
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

45:50.499 --> 45:53.168
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

45:53.877 --> 45:56.338
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

45:59.216 --> 46:01.260
' Arya!
' Nymeria!

46:01.385 --> 46:02.261
Arya!

46:02.386 --> 46:03.845
Nymeria!

46:08.809 --> 46:10.686
No.

46:10.811 --> 46:13.272
No. Please don't.

46:13.397 --> 46:15.691
Arya, leave him alone.

46:34.418 --> 46:37.796
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.299
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

46:40.424 --> 46:41.591
Then go!

46:43.510 --> 46:45.721
Don't touch me.

46:47.889 --> 46:50.809
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

46:56.940 --> 47:00.777
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

47:00.902 --> 47:02.988
Go on. Run.

47:06.199 --> 47:08.243
Go! Leave now!

47:10.662 --> 47:12.789
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

47:18.712 --> 47:21.965
I think I heard a noise.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.135
Go!

47:37.397 --> 47:39.941
'Arya!

47:40.942 --> 47:42.277
Arya!

47:43.945 --> 47:44.946
Arya!

47:45.739 --> 47:47.949
Arya!

47:49.201 --> 47:50.660
Arya!

47:51.328 --> 47:52.954
Arya!

47:53.080 --> 47:55.165
My lord!

47:55.290 --> 47:57.334
My Lord! They've found her.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.961
- She's unharmed.
-  Arya!

48:00.087 --> 48:02.422
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

48:02.547 --> 48:04.341
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

48:04.466 --> 48:06.593
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

48:06.718 --> 48:09.346
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

48:09.471 --> 48:11.723
Back! Back to the inn!

48:12.724 --> 48:14.476
All back!

48:22.317 --> 48:24.111
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.779
- Are you hurt?
- No.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.323
Oh, it's all right.

48:30.117 --> 48:32.828
What is the meaning of this?

48:32.953 --> 48:34.955
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

48:35.080 --> 48:36.873
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

48:36.998 --> 48:38.375
Quiet, woman.

48:39.668 --> 48:42.671
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

48:42.796 --> 48:45.090
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

48:45.841 --> 48:48.885
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

48:49.010 --> 48:51.138
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

48:51.263 --> 48:53.140
That's not true!

48:53.265 --> 48:55.851
She just... bit him a little.

48:56.685 --> 48:59.312
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

48:59.438 --> 49:02.649
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

49:02.816 --> 49:04.276
That's not what happened!

49:04.401 --> 49:07.571
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

49:07.696 --> 49:08.864
- Liar!
- Shut up!

49:08.989 --> 49:10.365
Enough!

49:10.490 --> 49:13.410
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

49:13.535 --> 49:15.787
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

49:18.039 --> 49:20.750
- Where's your other daughter, Ned'?
- In bed, asleep.

49:20.876 --> 49:22.878
She's not.

49:23.003 --> 49:25.380
Sansa, come here, darling.

49:36.391 --> 49:38.226
Now, child...

49:39.269 --> 49:41.188
tell me what happened.

49:41.313 --> 49:43.356
Tell it all and tell it true.

49:43.482 --> 49:45.984
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

49:54.493 --> 49:56.661
I don't know.

49:56.786 --> 49:59.789
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

50:00.874 --> 50:03.210
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

50:03.335 --> 50:04.794
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

50:04.920 --> 50:07.172
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

50:07.297 --> 50:10.759
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

50:10.884 --> 50:12.886
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

50:13.011 --> 50:14.429
whip her through the streets?

50:14.554 --> 50:17.599
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

50:17.724 --> 50:20.352
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

50:21.978 --> 50:25.440
You let that little girl disarm you?

50:31.696 --> 50:34.658
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

50:34.783 --> 50:37.536
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

50:38.870 --> 50:40.789
And what of the direwolf?

50:41.581 --> 50:44.000
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

50:47.087 --> 50:49.422
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

50:49.548 --> 50:52.217
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

50:52.342 --> 50:55.512
No? So be it.

50:55.637 --> 50:57.722
We have another wolf.

51:01.142 --> 51:02.727
As you will.

51:02.852 --> 51:06.106
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

51:06.231 --> 51:08.358
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

51:09.651 --> 51:12.237
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

51:12.362 --> 51:14.948
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

51:15.073 --> 51:17.158
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

51:17.284 --> 51:20.203
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

51:20.328 --> 51:22.706
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

51:22.831 --> 51:24.541
Is this your command?

51:25.750 --> 51:27.168
Your Grace?

51:33.800 --> 51:37.137
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

51:37.262 --> 51:39.222
Ser llyn, do me the honor.

51:39.347 --> 51:40.724
No.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.768
Jgry...

51:45.228 --> 51:47.272
take the girls to their rooms.

51:51.568 --> 51:53.987
If it must be done,

51:54.112 --> 51:56.072
then I'll do it myself.

51:56.197 --> 51:58.241
Is this some trick?

51:58.366 --> 52:00.410
The wolf is of the North.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.372
She deserves better than a butcher

52:37.822 --> 52:41.409
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down'?

52:41.534 --> 52:43.536
He ran.

52:43.662 --> 52:45.246
Not very fast.
