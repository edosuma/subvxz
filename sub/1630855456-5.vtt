WEBVTT

00:30.447 --> 00:32.073
God, it's so quiet!

00:32.783 --> 00:34.535
Can someone just say something?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.119
- Like, anything.
- I'm sorry.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.705
- No, not you.
- Is my quiet contemplation

00:38.705 --> 00:42.292
of my son's death
not chatty enough for you?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.210
Oh, my God.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.004
While we wait for Sebastian
to finish his business dealings,

00:46.004 --> 00:48.257
let's play a parlor game.

00:48.257 --> 00:54.179
Those of us who did not murder Edgar
on one team, and Grace on the other.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.681
You know what, Isabel?

00:57.432 --> 01:00.310
It's funny you keep accusing my sister

01:00.310 --> 01:02.229
when the poison that killed Edgar

01:02.229 --> 01:04.730
came from your daughter's garden.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.442
- Is it?
- Yeah. Devil's trumpet.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.487
It was one of the flowers
from your centerpieces.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.613
I love the hue.

01:11.613 --> 01:16.201
Devil's trumpet. I've only heard
of it used as a psychotropic aid,

01:16.201 --> 01:20.581
the Aruk shaman of Chile brew it
in small doses to induce visions--

01:20.581 --> 01:22.416
Okay, we get it. You travel.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.377
What exactly are you suggesting?

01:25.377 --> 01:29.423
That my adopted daughter
murdered her own brother?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.383
- Hannah, did you murder Edgar?
- No.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.551
There you have it.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.636
Vivian, did you kill my son?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.681
What? Why would I?

01:37.681 --> 01:40.309
See. That wasn't a "no," was it?

01:40.309 --> 01:45.105
Okay, here's an idea.
Perhaps, you were all in on this together.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.902
Maybe you hatched a little family,
get-rich-quick scheme.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.486
We don't want your money.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.488
Everyone wants our money.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.138
You know, the more I think about it,
I'm pretty sure Sebastian did it.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.723
Really? And why is that?

03:01.723 --> 03:06.311
Well, Edgar secretly fired him.
Bombshell. Plus, he sucks.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.396
I get it, okay?

03:07.396 --> 03:11.108
Grace looks guilty as hell right now
and it would be damn sweet if the guy

03:11.108 --> 03:14.653
that's been charming your girl
all weekend, ended up taking the fall.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.531
But, babe, let's stay levelheaded.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.700
She wasn't charmed.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.452
You think she was charmed?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.830
The SEC's being
a real pair of granny's knickers.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.457
I'm in a knife fight here, Charles,
and I'm holding a sausage.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.502
I'm gonna have to mute you, mate.
One moment.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.754
Looky here, catch the killer yet?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.507
Let me guess, was it the bride
who wouldn't sign the prenup?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.634
- Do you have a few minutes to talk?
- Absolutely.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.637
To the real police.
Let me know when they get here.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.681
In the meantime, I'm a little busy.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.726
Too busy to explain
why Edgar secretly fired your ass?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.103
Or should we say, arse?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.940
Let's have a chat.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.616
Hey, how is your investigation going?

04:00.616 --> 04:02.117
Not great.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.536
First Isabel accuses my sister
of killing Edgar.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.414
And then she goes after my mom
and my entire family.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.209
Which actually makes me think
that she did it.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.836
You know, like a,
"whoever smelt it dealt it" situation

04:13.504 --> 04:14.505
but for murder.

04:14.505 --> 04:17.132
Actually, we've already
found some pretty damning

04:17.132 --> 04:18.382
information about Sebastian.

04:18.382 --> 04:23.347
I bet they all poisoned Edgar together.
And that is why they're accusing us.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.141
I mean,
we'd definitely have to prove that.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.976
Fine. That's what I'm going to do.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.397
Wrong way.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.735
Don't boil my house peppers
and call it Tuesday soup.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.695
We're not done here. Ciao.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.406
Good. He's back.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.327
Right, you have nine minutes
until my next call. Shoot.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.662
So, Edgar.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.580
Yes. He asked for my resignation.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.709
And yes, I kept it a secret.
But I didn't kill him.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.378
Hell, I wasn't even upset with him.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.004
Not after last night.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.299
I don't get it. If Edgar fired you,
why did you go to his wedding?

05:00.843 --> 05:04.304
To understand why I'm here,
you need to understand my past.

05:04.847 --> 05:08.183
You see, Edgar and I
are from very different worlds.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.476
He's from old money.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.146
Whereas I grew up in a trailer park
in San Bernardino.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.941
California? You're British.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.111
No. I just sound British.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.866
I'm actually a good, old boy
from the US of A.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.285
- Wait, what?
- Holy shit.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.870
Why would you lie about being British?

05:27.870 --> 05:30.664
Because it makes me seem charming
and intelligent.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.791
Who would you rather give money to?

05:32.791 --> 05:36.003
This loser or this fellow?

05:36.003 --> 05:40.799
That one. The second one.
I definitely would do things to him.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.302
So, why did I come to the wedding?

05:43.969 --> 05:47.848
Well, I guess you could say
I was after one last score.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.853
<i>I'd been pulling jobs since I was a kid.</i>

05:56.190 --> 05:59.860
<i>Back then, I was a poor nobody
from the middle of dirtbag nowhere.</i>

06:06.533 --> 06:07.659
<i>But I was a hustler.</i>

06:09.077 --> 06:10.913
<i>And I had a homegrown crew.</i>

06:11.663 --> 06:12.998
<i>My cousin, Jaxson.</i>

06:13.832 --> 06:17.419
<i>And his brother, Judson.
Who was also my cousin.</i>

06:30.933 --> 06:33.727
What the hell?
I slipped on a puddle of soap.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.147
Smashed my Yoo-hoo.
What kind of store is this?

06:38.148 --> 06:41.318
My dad's a lawyer and he'll sue you
for everything you've got, mister.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.406
My knee's clicking. Can you hear that?
My knee's never clicked before.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.700
Hey!

06:49.868 --> 06:53.997
You little shits! You're going nowhere!

06:55.249 --> 06:56.875
I'm talking about in life!

06:57.501 --> 06:59.878
<i>We were good. But he was right.</i>

06:59.878 --> 07:03.841
<i>Pulling cheap cons with my dirtbag cousins
was a ticket to nowhere.</i>

07:03.841 --> 07:06.426
<i>I had to get out of there. Fast.</i>

07:07.594 --> 07:10.889
<i>So, with some fake test scores
and a forged letter of recommendation,</i>

07:11.431 --> 07:14.643
<i>I conned my way into a full ride
at a fancy boarding school.</i>

07:16.979 --> 07:18.272
<i>That's where I met Edgar.</i>

07:24.111 --> 07:26.613
<i>Edgar was one
of the richest kids in the school.</i>

07:27.239 --> 07:28.240
What's this?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.200
<i>I knew he'd look down on me,</i>

07:30.200 --> 07:33.370
<i>so I decided I would try out a posh,
new accent.</i>

07:34.204 --> 07:35.289
That?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.958
It's just my favorite thing
in the entire world.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.544
It's a 1994 Justin Tunder rookie card.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.964
American baseball. I can't get enough.

07:43.964 --> 07:48.260
Tunder? He's a terrible infielder
with a .187 batting average.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.553
That card is worthless.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.722
But this is a misprint.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.269
Turder. Turd. That's hysterical.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.855
I like jokes. I want it. How much?

07:59.855 --> 08:01.648
Sorry, chap. It's not for sale.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.192
Everything's for sale.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.486
Why don't we play for it?

08:06.486 --> 08:11.658
I win, I get the card.
You win, you can have my watch.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.286
<i>A watch worth more
than my old man's houseboat?</i>

08:14.870 --> 08:16.330
<i>Too much to pass up.</i>

08:16.872 --> 08:19.082
<i>But I knew a hustle when I saw one.</i>

08:19.082 --> 08:21.251
<i>I wasn't gonna beat him at his own game.</i>

08:22.169 --> 08:25.506
<i>But Connect Four? The poor kid's chess?</i>

08:26.173 --> 08:27.633
<i>That, I could play.</i>

08:38.393 --> 08:39.520
Four.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.938
Again.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.648
Best two out of three.

08:48.403 --> 08:52.241
<i>If I was a smart cookie,
Edgar was the whole goddamn platter.</i>

08:53.242 --> 08:57.538
<i>No matter what I did, he always set a trap
so he'd have two ways to win.</i>

08:58.455 --> 08:59.790
That's four.

09:03.502 --> 09:07.297
By the way, the accent's a nice touch.
But it needs some work.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.675
<i>Edgar saw right through me.</i>

09:09.675 --> 09:12.135
<i>He took the only thing of value
I'd ever owned.</i>

09:12.803 --> 09:14.054
<i>But I wasn't mad.</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:17.432
<i>See, in the game of life,
Edgar was the house.</i>

09:17.432 --> 09:20.435
<i>He got dealt a different hand
than the rest of us.</i>

09:20.435 --> 09:24.523
If you can't beat the house,
you have to become the house.

09:24.523 --> 09:28.777
I convinced Edgar to team up.
He'd be the brains, I'd be the face.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.322
And the ass. And the abs.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.074
I'd like to see all of those.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.785
- You got a warrant?
- What are you doing?

09:37.452 --> 09:40.706
We were a perfect team.
Started pulling small cons.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.625
The Spanish Prisoner, Norseekee Twist,

09:43.625 --> 09:45.419
- even a Mwamba Shuffle.
- What?

09:45.419 --> 09:49.423
Then, after college, we launched
the biggest hustle of them all.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.967
A totally legal hedge fund.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.386
Built the whole biz from the ground up.

09:54.386 --> 09:58.307
With nothing but a $2.4 million loan
from Edgar's dad.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.061
<i>We were unstoppable. Rolling in cash.</i>

10:03.645 --> 10:06.273
<i>Until Edgar pulled us into crypto.</i>

10:06.273 --> 10:09.401
Eddyboy,
I had my doubts but you were right.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.362
Bucephalus is through the roof.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.116
I see you've upgraded
the old security on the safe.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.536
Well, it holds the keys
to my cryptocurrency,

10:19.536 --> 10:23.081
which, as you've just noted,
is now worth quite a lot of money.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.166
Though...

10:25.250 --> 10:26.835
it could have been worth more.

10:28.670 --> 10:34.927
You held back 20% of our capital.
But I told you to invest everything.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.222
It was 20%. We were exposed.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.516
The only thing exposed
was your lack of faith.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.227
- You cost me millions.
- Come on.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.645
You're fired, Sebastian.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.565
You can't be serious.
Edgar, it was a hedge.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.362
Crypto is volatile.
It's all about perception.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.989
Everything is about perception.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.324
Take the <i>Mona Lisa</i>.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.869
It's a middling portrait of a woman
who's a six at best.

11:01.411 --> 11:05.207
And yet, we've all decided
it's a priceless masterpiece and so it is.

11:05.207 --> 11:08.961
Or take that turd card
that I took from you

11:08.961 --> 11:10.170
the first day we met.

11:10.963 --> 11:15.801
Now, to some, a dog, say,
it's just a piece of cardboard,

11:16.343 --> 11:19.596
but it has tremendous value
because we've assigned it tremendous value

11:19.596 --> 11:23.851
which is why
I cannot have you undermining me.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.772
But we're partners.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.483
We've been together for decades.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.488
You're gonna throw
all of that away over this?

11:37.990 --> 11:38.991
Tell you what.

11:39.741 --> 11:43.537
I'm gonna give you Monday
as a deadline to hand in your resignation

11:43.537 --> 11:46.790
because I don't want anything
to be awkward at the wedding this weekend.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.626
You expect me to still come
to your wedding after this?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.962
Of course. I mean, this is just business.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.840
You're still my best man.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.010
<i>Damn. That's cold as hell.</i>

11:58.010 --> 11:59.928
That doesn't sound like the Edgar I knew.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.556
He was very nice to me actually.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.184
That's because he didn't want anything
from you.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.811
You were of absolutely zero value to him, whatsoever.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.313
I wouldn't say zero value.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.273
I helped him tie his bow tie, so...

12:11.273 --> 12:12.608
Adorable.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.403
When it came to business,
Edgar was ruthless.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.948
I'd helped him build his empire
and he was gonna clean me out?

12:20.908 --> 12:25.370
I couldn't take that lying down.
And the wedding was the perfect cover.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.706
But for a heist this big,

12:27.706 --> 12:29.625
I was gonna need one hell of a--

12:29.625 --> 12:31.168
Teddy!

12:31.168 --> 12:33.545
- The fuck?
- You great, big knob.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.631
How the devil are you?

12:35.631 --> 12:38.926
Yeah, sorry.
I was just having a piss in the loo.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.053
Two minutes. Talk to me.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.263
I told you not to take those centerpieces.

12:43.263 --> 12:48.352
I know. What are we going to do, huh?
We can't just walk out holding these.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.687
Hear me out. We flush them.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.981
- Down the toilet?
- Yeah, we'll do it carefully.

12:52.981 --> 12:56.109
- There's, like, a hundred flowers here.
- Okay, one stem at a time.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.446
Well, well, well.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.323
We can explain this.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.741
Wait.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.034
Yeah, of course.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.870
Toodle-pip, matey. Cheerio, me old mucker.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.831
Right, where was I?

13:09.831 --> 13:12.626
I think it was something
about putting together a team?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.795
Teams play softball.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.423
When you're pulling a heist,
you need a crew.

13:19.216 --> 13:23.595
I needed professional criminals.
Guys Edgar had never met before.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.640
Prison has actually been
really great for me.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.517
I mean, it's given me time.

13:29.226 --> 13:34.147
Which is exactly what I needed
to finish the album.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.149
When the world hears
what I've been cooking up

13:36.149 --> 13:37.985
behind these very thick walls,

13:37.985 --> 13:40.028
you might as well give me
another life sentence

13:40.028 --> 13:43.323
because I will be guilty of killing it.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.783
One time for pushing...

13:44.783 --> 13:48.662
- <i>And the other time for singing</i>
- Sir, I'm your attorney.

13:48.662 --> 13:53.000
<i>These bars can't hold
These bars</i>

13:53.000 --> 13:55.085
Stop. Okay, this is what it's about.

13:55.085 --> 13:58.839
These bars, as in prison,
can't hold these bars,

13:58.839 --> 14:02.259
the song that I'm singing to you.
Right now.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.511
I feel like the acoustics
are real messed up.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.723
What if I take you to the prison shower?
The acoustics there are unbelievable.

14:07.723 --> 14:09.850
By the way,
what does "for life" actually mean?

14:09.850 --> 14:11.768
'Cause I feel like I've been here enough.

14:14.730 --> 14:19.109
It's our cousin Seabass,
come flopping back to our humble shores.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.485
What did they get you for this time?

14:20.485 --> 14:22.988
Simple smash and grab.
Judson fucked it up.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.698
What? No, you fucked it up.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.742
I was supposed to smash,
you were supposed to grab.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.869
Yeah, but I like smashing, shithead.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.872
- Guys. Hey!
- You can't grab me now, asshole.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.582
Ladies, stop it.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.128
What if I told you
I could spring you out of here?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.839
- What's in it for us?
- We don't want your charity.

14:40.839 --> 14:45.219
I need you for a job. A big one.
And the warden owes me a favor.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.890
Here's the mark. Edgar Minnows.
And here's the score.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.059
This safe, here.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.438
<i>Hidden behind three layers of security.</i>

14:57.397 --> 14:59.942
Job like this? You're looking at at least...

14:59.942 --> 15:04.780
A Fatboy Slim, a pudding slinger
and the dumbest Lee Majors of all time.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.199
And here is how we're gonna do it.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.743
<i>Word is the wedding deejay's
not feeling so hot.</i>

15:09.743 --> 15:11.954
<i>Judson, maybe you could check up on him.</i>

15:11.954 --> 15:14.706
Well, you look like shit.
Maybe you should go home.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.920
<i>I heard the caterer's understaffed.</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:21.839
<i>Jaxson, maybe you could lend a hand.</i>

15:23.215 --> 15:24.925
<i>I'll need four and a half minutes</i>

15:24.925 --> 15:26.552
<i>to get to the safe and crack it.</i>

15:26.552 --> 15:28.929
<i>I'll need a distraction. I'm thinking...</i>

15:28.929 --> 15:30.848
<i>First dance? I'm on it.</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:34.768
<i>Four and a half minutes?
Hot damn. How tough is that safe?</i>

15:34.768 --> 15:36.186
<i>Nearly impossible.</i>

15:37.020 --> 15:40.732
<i>First up, a keypad
with ten million possible combinations.</i>

15:42.276 --> 15:43.443
<i>Leave that to me.</i>

15:44.069 --> 15:47.239
<i>Second, a retinal scan,
but it's not for Edgar.</i>

15:47.239 --> 15:49.408
<i>So, I'll need you two to--</i>

15:49.408 --> 15:52.035
Thump that lizard
and pop out her eyeballs? Done.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.246
What? No. Jesus Christ.

15:54.246 --> 15:57.791
I'll need you to run a distraction
so that I can steal the lizard.

15:57.791 --> 16:02.212
Fine. But at some point this weekend,
I will thump someone.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.464
- Really?
- What about this third level?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.508
The horsey box?

16:08.177 --> 16:13.807
That horsey box is a solid steel case
with a six-letter alphabetical code.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.102
I haven't cracked it yet.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.688
What do you mean
you haven't cracked it yet?

16:19.688 --> 16:22.983
Yeah. Without that code
we're like Leo in the <i>Titanic</i>.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.611
Hot for a guy who doesn't work out,
but dead in the water.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.156
I will figure it out, okay?
I just need more time.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.325
I'm late for dinner.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.621
<i>I needed to convince Edgar</i>

16:35.621 --> 16:37.706
<i>that nothing would be awkward
at the wedding.</i>

16:38.207 --> 16:39.625
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.251
Why wouldn't I make it?

16:41.251 --> 16:43.629
After all, I'm your best man.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.673
<i>So, I flirted with the maid of honor,</i>

16:46.673 --> 16:48.175
<i>introduced the surprise guest...</i>

16:48.175 --> 16:49.259
Ulysses.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.512
<i>And after you spit all over Vivian,</i>

16:52.012 --> 16:55.557
<i>I had another drink
and slipped off to Edgar's office.</i>

16:55.557 --> 16:56.683
<i>But on the way there...</i>

16:56.683 --> 17:00.437
I know your secret, Vivian.
And if you don't tell, I will.

17:00.437 --> 17:04.608
Edgar, please.
There is more to this than you understand.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.692
Disagree.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.945
Hold up. Now Vivian had a secret?

17:10.364 --> 17:11.906
That's interesting.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.867
But, I mean, is it a bad secret?
Or was it just like, something fun?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.162
We don't know, right?
Probably no way we could ever know.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.747
We could ask her.

17:19.873 --> 17:20.749
Continue.

17:22.584 --> 17:27.714
<i>With the coast clear,
it was time to enact part one of the plan.</i>

17:28.632 --> 17:33.220
<i>You can imagine my surprise
when I discovered I wasn't alone.</i>

17:33.220 --> 17:37.015
<i>But hey, what's a heist
without a little competition?</i>

17:37.516 --> 17:38.851
Well, well, well.

17:38.851 --> 17:42.104
Seems as though I've caught you
with your hand in the biscuit tin.

17:44.731 --> 17:49.528
Sebastian Drapewood.
I wondered when we'd come face to face.

17:49.528 --> 17:53.073
Looks like I've busted you
having a little tinkle in the deep end.

17:53.657 --> 17:58.537
I was just looking for some termites
in the undercarriage.

17:59.037 --> 18:03.375
Drop the act.
I know why you're here. That safe.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.751
What, you mean that safe?

18:04.751 --> 18:08.422
That one, yeah. There's over
$200 million of crypto in there.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.718
You mean Bucephalus, right?

18:12.718 --> 18:15.804
I know all about it.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.515
The only question I have for you is...

18:19.683 --> 18:20.934
"What is it?"

18:20.934 --> 18:22.227
Sorry, what?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.312
It's a compound word.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.898
- I know phallus is a man's...
- Yes.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.692
But the Buce part--

18:29.484 --> 18:33.530
Bucephalus. It's the name
of Alexander the Great's horse.

18:35.532 --> 18:40.037
You see,
Edgar's old man was named Alexander,

18:40.037 --> 18:44.416
and, being a narcissist,
he was obsessed with Alexander the Great.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.752
And Edgar was obsessed with his old man.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.339
<i>The final passcode!</i>

18:50.339 --> 18:53.550
<i>It had to be
the name of Edgar's father's horse.</i>

18:54.510 --> 18:56.553
<i>But what was that damn horse called?</i>

18:57.262 --> 19:00.599
<i>I needed a way to get the name
without raising Edgar's suspicion.</i>

19:01.141 --> 19:02.142
Don't touch anything.

19:02.142 --> 19:05.479
<i>I'd have to pull
a classic Don Juan honey stick.</i>

19:08.524 --> 19:11.318
Good evening. Couldn't sleep.
Thought you might like a--

19:11.318 --> 19:12.319
Not interested.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.403
Righto.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.949
<i>Like I said, a Don Juan honey stick.</i>

19:16.949 --> 19:20.536
Hello there. I couldn't sleep.
Thought you might like a drink.

19:20.536 --> 19:24.790
Sebastian Drapewood.
What are you doing here at this hour?

19:24.790 --> 19:28.085
I think we both know
what goes on at this hour.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.587
I had no idea you felt that way.

19:31.547 --> 19:32.965
Maybe it's the love in the air.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.132
Maybe it's all that

19:35.008 --> 19:37.094
white wine and garlic
wafting off your body.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.763
<i>With Isabel?</i>

19:39.763 --> 19:43.016
<i>For a score like this,
you do what you have to do.</i>

19:43.642 --> 19:46.979
I want you to ride me
the same way your dead husband rode...

19:48.146 --> 19:49.773
What was the name of his horse again?

19:49.773 --> 19:53.026
What is this?
Did Edgar put you up to this?

19:54.152 --> 19:56.822
Did your son send me here
to sleep with you?

19:58.073 --> 19:59.366
Get out.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.659
Could I just--

20:00.659 --> 20:01.743
Get out.

20:01.743 --> 20:02.870
I need my pants.

20:02.870 --> 20:06.248
Get out before you lose
more than those trousers.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.457
Goodbye.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.881
<i>I had to get back to my cottage
without drawing any attention.</i>

20:13.881 --> 20:16.800
<i>It was gonna take
more than a multi-point security system</i>

20:16.800 --> 20:19.428
<i>with floodlights and infrared sensors
to catch me.</i>

20:20.179 --> 20:22.723
<i>All I had to do
was stay in the blind spots.</i>

20:26.894 --> 20:27.895
Fuck.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.776
What the hell?

20:37.070 --> 20:39.323
- Aniq?
- You know, thanks to you,

20:39.323 --> 20:42.492
my girlfriend's parents thought
we were hooking up in the bushes.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.871
You wish.
Only when I'm drunk and in Europe.

20:46.955 --> 20:50.209
Everybody in. Come on,
I have something to show you.

20:50.209 --> 20:51.293
Okay.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.461
What's going on?

20:52.461 --> 20:53.795
Are those my centerpieces?

20:53.795 --> 20:57.633
That's proof.
Proof that Grace killed my boy

20:57.633 --> 20:59.760
and Vivian and Feng supplied the poison.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.137
Why else would they have
all of these flowers?

21:02.137 --> 21:04.389
- There's a perfectly good explanation...
- I can explain!

21:04.389 --> 21:06.642
- ...if you just let us speak!
- Oh, my God.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.603
What? What is so amusing?

21:09.603 --> 21:12.147
I don't know. But I'm laughing too.

21:12.147 --> 21:15.400
You only think this proves something
because you don't know our mom.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.319
Mom, dump out your purse.

21:17.319 --> 21:18.487
- Yeah, show them.
- Okay--

21:18.487 --> 21:20.447
- Okay, girls. Just-- Okay.
- Yeah, do it.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.949
- Mom, do it.
- Girls. Just--

21:21.949 --> 21:23.909
- Hai.
- Okay, just--

21:23.909 --> 21:25.285
I...

21:28.664 --> 21:31.750
She never leaves a restaurant
without pocketing all the Sweet'N Low.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.835
Like all of them.

21:32.835 --> 21:34.962
It's true,
and she doesn't even like Sweet'N Low.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.630
It's too sweet.

21:36.630 --> 21:38.799
You see,
she only gathered all of the centerpieces

21:38.799 --> 21:40.384
'cause she didn't wanna waste them.

21:40.384 --> 21:44.638
Yeah. She's not a killer.
She's just cheap.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.890
Frugality is a virtue.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.310
You're just the definition of prudence.
So, should I hide the silverware?

21:50.310 --> 21:51.812
- Come on.
- Why you gotta be like that?

21:51.812 --> 21:54.648
- Wow, Karen. Wow.
- You're like, so salty all the time.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.066
Wait a second!

21:56.608 --> 21:58.527
The Devil's Trumpet
is missing from this one.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.739
So, it was the poison.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.908
And we were all at the rehearsal
in the barn,

22:04.908 --> 22:07.452
- so that means anybody could have done it.
- The horse ate it!

22:07.452 --> 22:10.247
Anybody could've done it. Exactly.

22:10.247 --> 22:11.999
It was the morning of the wedding

22:11.999 --> 22:14.293
and I still didn't have the code
to the horse box.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.669
<i>But it was go time.</i>

22:17.838 --> 22:20.215
Gentlemen. You scrub up well.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.970
Are you going to the wedding?
Our ride never showed.

22:25.679 --> 22:26.889
Indeed I am.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.892
Hey, hey! Look who I found.

22:35.397 --> 22:39.401
<i>The crew were in place.
Now it was my turn.</i>

22:39.985 --> 22:44.323
<i>Look at you, old boy.
Who's the face of the operation now?</i>

22:44.323 --> 22:48.118
I need my cuff links. And they're in my...

22:50.829 --> 22:52.539
Would you grab Aniq for me?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.166
I need some help tying my bow tie,

22:54.166 --> 22:55.918
and he seems
like he'd have a knack for knotting.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.252
- I could tie it.
- I'd prefer Aniq.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.337
Okay.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.634
<i>I knew he'd kick me out
so I couldn't see the keypad.</i>

23:04.301 --> 23:05.969
<i>That's why I planted the pen.</i>

23:07.804 --> 23:09.306
<i>One down, two to go.</i>

23:10.015 --> 23:12.351
<i>But I still needed
the code for the horse box.</i>

23:12.976 --> 23:15.229
There he is. The hand kisser.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.314
Come on, man.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.942
<i>So, it was time for a Hail Mary.</i>

23:19.942 --> 23:21.818
Isabel, about last night--

23:21.818 --> 23:26.323
No, listen, I threw all of your things
out the window, except your underpants.

23:26.323 --> 23:27.824
Yeah, I'm keeping those.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.869
Fair enough. Listen, when I asked you
about the name of Alexander's--

23:30.869 --> 23:32.162
No, you listen to me.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.998
You tell Edgar I remember everything.

23:35.499 --> 23:37.626
The horse's name was Nutmeg.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.337
- Nutmeg?
- Nutmeg.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.424
<i>Six letters. The code.
And she just gave it to you?</i>

23:44.424 --> 23:46.593
<i>Yep. But there was a setback.</i>

23:46.593 --> 23:48.720
What do you mean
you're not having a first dance?

23:48.720 --> 23:51.473
You know how Edgar gets
in front of crowds. It's too much for him.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.683
You have to have one.

23:54.059 --> 23:57.646
You're a partnership now. It's 50-50.

23:58.272 --> 24:00.107
Don't let him take what's yours.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.692
I do really want a first dance.

24:01.692 --> 24:05.779
That's more like it.
Have a long one. Enjoy yourself.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.075
<i>Now all I needed was that lizard.</i>

24:10.659 --> 24:14.079
Okay, gang. Here's an idea.
How about we try one without Roxana?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.414
Aniq can grab her.

24:17.875 --> 24:20.419
- That's all right, isn't it, Edgar?
- Of course. Aniq's trustworthy.

24:29.761 --> 24:33.348
Lee Majors has the bounty.
Jaxson, it's go time.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.063
Hors d'oeuvre, sir?

24:41.023 --> 24:42.024
What's this?

24:42.024 --> 24:43.859
Fish piles?

24:43.859 --> 24:45.235
Well, I don't mind if I do.

24:45.944 --> 24:48.071
You know, Ahi Tuna and Yellowfin Tuna...

24:48.071 --> 24:50.699
- That's interesting.
- ...are two different names. Same fish.

24:51.742 --> 24:52.743
Oh, no.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.204
Roxana?

24:55.954 --> 24:57.789
You son of a bitch.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.086
Judson, you're up.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.130
Seabass, we got a problem.

25:05.130 --> 25:08.884
The couple just picked their first
dance song. It's 40 seconds too short.

25:08.884 --> 25:11.303
Well, vamp, damn it. Vamp!

25:11.303 --> 25:12.554
I'm on it.

25:13.388 --> 25:16.683
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:16.683 --> 25:20.020
If I can get your attention
to the dance floor.

25:20.020 --> 25:26.860
It is time
for our happy couple's first dance.

25:27.486 --> 25:34.326
But before they dance,
I'd like to say a few words if I may.

25:35.202 --> 25:38.413
I have deejayed a lot of weddings.

25:38.413 --> 25:44.044
The majority of them end up folding
like a cheap lawn chair.

25:44.795 --> 25:47.381
<i>Yeah, I'm talking about divorce.</i>

25:47.881 --> 25:50.175
<i>I've been divorced three times myself.</i>

25:50.175 --> 25:52.261
<i>The fourth is currently pending.</i>

25:52.928 --> 25:55.764
If she thinks she's gonna
get that Sea Doo,

25:55.764 --> 25:59.268
man, she really is
out of her fucking mind.

25:59.268 --> 26:02.479
Divorce law doesn't cover watercraft.
That's maritime law.

26:02.479 --> 26:07.150
But when I look at this couple right here,
I think to myself,

26:07.150 --> 26:12.656
<i>"Now there's a couple that's gonna spend
a long and happy life together."</i>

26:13.740 --> 26:15.534
Anyhoo, here's this song.

26:19.746 --> 26:23.792
Hey, that was a terrific toast.
The music's good too.

26:23.792 --> 26:26.920
You mind if I post up back here with you?
I need a bird's eye.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.630
Why would you need to do that?

26:28.630 --> 26:33.135
Let's just say some criminal shit
is definitely going down tonight.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.308
- <i>Oh, no.</i>
- I'm on it.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.948
Shit. Seabass, come in.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.367
Seabass. Come in.

26:58.035 --> 27:00.454
I don't know what--

27:46.708 --> 27:48.627
You had an alarm on the safe, didn't you?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.344
I'm only here for what's mine.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.806
But it's not yours.
I won it fair and square.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.474
This was never fair.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.101
Why don't we play for it?

28:06.186 --> 28:07.813
Just like old times.

28:07.813 --> 28:09.815
May the best man win.

28:17.114 --> 28:22.744
Oh, my God. S-E-C-4.
Sebastian, Edgar, Connect Four!

28:22.744 --> 28:26.540
No wonder I couldn't solve it.
It's not a puzzle, it's a scorecard.

28:26.540 --> 28:28.750
Edgar had been keeping tally for years.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.753
But this wasn't just
a game of Connect Four.

28:32.588 --> 28:35.799
This was my one shot
to finally beat the house.

28:39.219 --> 28:40.262
Shall we?

29:04.453 --> 29:08.498
<i>No matter where I played,
he had a winning move.</i>

29:09.374 --> 29:13.962
<i>He set me up, just like he used to.
Two ways to win.</i>

29:15.589 --> 29:18.425
We both know how this ends, Sebastian.

29:19.301 --> 29:20.302
Pick one.

29:44.326 --> 29:46.828
You know what?
I'm gonna let you have this.

29:50.249 --> 29:54.586
But I can't let you take all of it
because that would be too risky.

29:55.379 --> 29:59.258
I should hold on to 20%, right?

29:59.925 --> 30:01.009
Yeah.

30:01.844 --> 30:04.763
Call it a hedge?

30:10.727 --> 30:13.272
Now, get the hell out of my office.

30:13.939 --> 30:15.691
You definitely killed that dude.

30:15.691 --> 30:17.067
Why would I kill Edgar?

30:17.067 --> 30:19.027
Because he chopped up your turd card.

30:19.653 --> 30:22.030
Except he didn't, did he?

30:24.074 --> 30:26.994
What? But how?

30:26.994 --> 30:31.081
<i>I was never gonna take my card
from his safe without replacing it.</i>

30:31.081 --> 30:33.166
<i>I couldn't have Edgar realizing
it was gone.</i>

30:34.084 --> 30:37.504
<i>So, I bought another one without the typo.</i>

30:38.255 --> 30:40.632
<i>I made sure I had two ways to win.</i>

30:41.758 --> 30:45.679
<i>Like I said,
I wanted to beat Edgar at his own game.</i>

30:47.055 --> 30:48.682
So, that's your whole story?

30:48.682 --> 30:51.393
Why were you drowning your sorrows
at the after-party?

30:51.393 --> 30:53.604
I wasn't. I was celebrating.

30:54.980 --> 30:59.610
Oh, yeah. There was one thing there
that might interest you.

31:00.194 --> 31:04.448
<i>When I got to the bar,
I saw Ulysses doing something to a glass.</i>

31:05.407 --> 31:06.992
Everything all right, kemosabe?

31:06.992 --> 31:08.285
Of course.

31:09.870 --> 31:10.913
What can I get you?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.081
Shackleton.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.462
<i>So what exactly was Ulysses doing
with the glass?</i>

31:18.462 --> 31:21.548
I don't know. But he was hiding something.

31:22.174 --> 31:23.842
Something he didn't want me to see.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.262
I gotta get this.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.849
So, I didn't kill Edgar.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.310
I left millions in that safe.

31:33.852 --> 31:37.189
And this card is worth, what?
Mid six figures?

31:37.189 --> 31:39.983
It's basically just sentimental value.

31:41.193 --> 31:42.236
We done?

31:43.904 --> 31:47.074
Landon, you goateed fucker. How are you?

31:47.074 --> 31:49.159
Remember how I told you
I'd never tell your wife

31:49.159 --> 31:50.744
about that night we had in Prague?

31:50.744 --> 31:53.789
- I think it's clear, we've got our guy.
- That's not our guy.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.290
What did you say? Got or not?

31:55.290 --> 31:56.750
- Not.
- What?

31:56.750 --> 32:00.337
The only person who can corroborate
his story is Edgar, who's dead.

32:00.337 --> 32:04.007
We need to figure out what he was talking
about when he said Zoë's mom had secrets.

32:04.007 --> 32:07.928
And what's going on
with this uncle and a glass?

32:07.928 --> 32:10.013
What, you wanna interrogate Zoë's family?

32:10.013 --> 32:14.017
No. No, no, no. We can't do that.
They didn't kill Edgar.

32:14.017 --> 32:18.355
Look, I get it. But if we wanna
find the truth, we have to stay objective.

32:18.939 --> 32:21.441
Yeah, like you just were with Sebastian?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.735
I mean, you spent the whole interview
trying to bang him.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.487
I was telling him what he wanted to hear.

32:25.487 --> 32:27.990
He's a charmer.
I let him think he charmed me.

32:27.990 --> 32:30.284
When folks get comfortable, they slip up.

32:30.284 --> 32:33.954
Well, that's actually very smart.

32:33.954 --> 32:34.872
I know.

32:34.872 --> 32:37.374
But I'm supposed to be clearing
Grace's name, not--

32:38.750 --> 32:40.335
Zoë's not gonna like this.

32:40.961 --> 32:43.088
And I really need her parents to like me.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.175
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.301
What's that mean?

32:47.801 --> 32:49.094
- Have a seat.
- What?

32:49.094 --> 32:51.555
- Sit down!
- I actually am already.

32:51.555 --> 32:53.140
I have a confession to make.

32:53.140 --> 32:58.187
I wasn't exactly honest
about why I left the force.

32:58.187 --> 33:00.522
And I did some things
I shouldn't have done

33:00.522 --> 33:05.736
because sometimes when you're too close
to something, you can't see the truth.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.576
Do your job.

33:19.958 --> 33:21.043
Cleaning the pool?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.378
Someone has to.

33:24.213 --> 33:25.339
Lot of dead bees.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.258
It's very sad.

33:30.511 --> 33:35.265
I'm sorry Isabel was kind of a--
Well, as they say in French, a bitch.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.856
I told Aniq and that lady about us.

33:44.816 --> 33:45.817
I know.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.903
But I didn't tell them everything.
