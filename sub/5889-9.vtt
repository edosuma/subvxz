00:04.520 --> 00:07.649
We are just now getting word of a story
developing out of Hong Kong.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.320
Sources say authorities there
have apprehended...

00:10.520 --> 00:12.682
...legendary criminal
Raymond Reddington.

00:12.880 --> 00:17.124
He's been on the FBI's most wanted list
longer than any other fugitive...

00:17.320 --> 00:19.243
...but tonight, sources are confirming...

00:19.440 --> 00:22.569
...Reddington was arrested
in Hong Kong just hours ago.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.923
Reddington was once
a rising star at the Pentagon.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.327
Sources say he was being groomed
for admiral...

00:28.520 --> 00:31.444
...when, on Christmas eve, 1990,
while on his way home...

00:31.640 --> 00:33.165
Reddington vanished.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.328
Four years later,
Reddington resurfaced...

00:35.520 --> 00:37.124
...and was charged with treason...

00:37.320 --> 00:40.130
...for selling American intelligence
to foreign states.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.243
From this point forward,
you don't exist.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.169
Oh, heh, that's a load off.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.891
Just hours ago,
the U. S. State Department confirmed...

00:48.080 --> 00:50.481
...Reddington has been remanded
into U. S. custody...

00:50.680 --> 00:53.365
...but officials will not comment
on his current location.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.087
Reddington's off the radar.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.681
What do you mean?
We don't know where Reddington is?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.370
- CIA's not saying.
- Why not?

01:26.600 --> 01:27.647
Reddington's our asset.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.808
Only 41 people
in the U.S. government know.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.889
I've talked to all of them.
Nobody knows.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.560
He's been on the run for years.
His arrest was bound to happen.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.882
He moves too fluidly
to get caught up in something

01:37.080 --> 01:39.651
...as obvious as a public assassination
in Hong Kong.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.161
- No, he wanted this to happen.
- What if he didn't?

01:42.360 --> 01:44.249
Why would Reddington
wanna get captured?

01:44.440 --> 01:47.683
His arrest was overseas. He
must've wanted proximity to something.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.764
If he's grabbed, it's either
by the CIA ground branch or JSOC.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.731
You think it's an intelligence apparatus
that's holding him?

01:53.960 --> 01:56.008
Scrub our sources at Langley
and do it fast.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.171
Once they drop him in whatever hole
he's headed for, he's not coming back.

02:11.680 --> 02:16.811
- 2-0-2, 5-5-5, 0-1-5-1.
- You speak when you're spoken to.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.561
2-0-2, 5-5-5, 0-1-5-1.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.366
Call the number. Ask for a houseman.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.001
Call the number.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.569
Fifty thousand dollars will be transferred
into the account of your choice.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.524
Fifty thousand.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.961
All I want is two minutes
with your warden.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.447
All right. We found him.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.162
Hey! Hey. We got him.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.966
CIA analyst confirmed
they're holding Reddington...

02:52.160 --> 02:53.730
...at a lockdown called The Factory.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.763
That's bad news.
That's really bad news.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.850
- That place is real?
- The Factory? Wait, what's The Factory?

02:59.040 --> 03:02.681
A level-10 detention facility specifically
designed to process detainees...

03:02.880 --> 03:04.769
...trained to withstand interrogation.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.281
Assets are brought in,
information is squeezed out.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.891
Data, intel, anything of value.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.920
- This place is a slaughterhouse for spies.
- They reduce them to ones and zeroes.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.727
What's left is a husk that either rots away
behind bars or is executed outright.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.770
- We gotta get him out.
- Think the CIA will let us talk to him?

03:19.960 --> 03:21.849
- Just walk in there? No.
- He's our asset.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.281
No, they're gonna keep him
all to themselves.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.086
If he went there on purpose,
I suspect it was to make contact...

03:27.240 --> 03:28.890
...with somebody
he couldn't get to on the outside.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.321
He gave up 25 years of freedom
to see this guy.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.800
I wanna know who he is...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.571
...and what intel he's got
that's so damned important.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.364
Master Sergeant Desmond says
you offered him a bribe.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.211
- Care to explain?
- Within 12 hours...

03:43.400 --> 03:46.290
...inmate Luther Todd Braxton
will break out of his cell.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.529
When he does, he will steal
a classified intelligence packet...

03:49.720 --> 03:52.769
...that contains secrets
vital to your national security.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.731
The means for his escape
and his team are already in place.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.885
This story feels like a desperate last gasp
from a dying man.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.366
Could be.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.803
Regardless, if you don't move quickly,
the prison will be overrun...

04:05.000 --> 04:08.209
...and the dozens of innocent men
and women who operate this facility...

04:08.400 --> 04:10.801
...will be subdued and executed,
beginning with you.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.843
Luther Braxton is in solitary.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.962
Not for long.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.720
He's not cooperating.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.282
Take him back to his cell.
We go again in two hours.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.530
Agent Cooper, Kat Goodson.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.843
The director has brought me here
to liaison with your task force.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.326
Of course. We've met.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.284
- The correspondents' dinner.
- Huh.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.370
You were the scotch, neat.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.767
Please, tell us what you know.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.803
I'm not at liberty to say.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.370
The Clandestine Service is aware...

05:43.560 --> 05:46.245
...of the arrangement your task force has
with Reddington.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.647
It's why we're running point
through your office.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.242
The director should've notified me before
sending Reddington to The Factory.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.568
The section chief sent a cable
from the warden.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.410
It said that Reddington claims...

05:56.600 --> 06:01.242
...that a detainee, one Luther Braxton,
poses a national security threat...

06:01.440 --> 06:04.887
...and we're hoping that you can tell us
something about their connection.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.124
I don't know.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.489
Who's Luther Braxton?

06:13.240 --> 06:17.131
Braxton is a thief.
Interpol's been hunting him for years.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.244
He plans his heists to occur
in the midst of chaos.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.565
He is organized, meticulous,
and he is bloody.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.286
He stole 282 million dollars
from Baghdad...

06:27.480 --> 06:30.324
...in the middle
of Operation Shock and Awe...

06:30.520 --> 06:33.842
...abducted a CIA asset out of Iran
during the '09 election protests.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.889
Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.088
The CIA announced his death
two months ago.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.328
We say that about a lot
of inmates at The Factory.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.444
Truth is Braxton's being interrogated
for secrets he stole...

06:43.640 --> 06:46.450
...from the Chinese,
from the Iranians, us.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.881
My money's on the fact
these two have a history.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.242
Reddington, Braxton,
they're planning something.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.204
Whatever it is, you'll find out.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.641
- Oh, we don't have authorization.
- You do now.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.842
Get to Reddington.
Find out what he's up to.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.760
Hey, Braxton, chow!

07:36.960 --> 07:40.009
We have a code Oscar, block B,
Dorm 6! Activate critical response!

07:40.200 --> 07:43.602
We need an emergency response team
in block B now!

07:53.160 --> 07:55.288
Get away from the door! Fire one!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.047
Tell me what you know.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.641
I tried. It's too late.
You've lost the facility.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.083
You tell me I'll have an escape before it
happens. Now you're getting evac'd out?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.049
Why the hell am I getting evac'd out?

08:32.280 --> 08:34.681
Orders from up top.
Bureau's cleared to send a team.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.928
- Tell them to turn around.
- What's happening?

08:37.159 --> 08:39.447
- We got a problem. ERF failed.
- Radio the chopper.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.847
- Get him to the evac team!
- Radio the chopper!

08:44.440 --> 08:46.522
Back up, back up!

09:01.440 --> 09:05.001
"Inmate number 2532, Xavier Chavez."
I know this name.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.682
He was a court-martialed
special operator out of Fort Carson.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.121
We got Kun Phan,
a.k.a. Cambodian Carl.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.001
Did 10 years in USP Florence for
hacking U. S. missile defense agency.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.366
What are you thinking?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.925
I'm counting five, maybe more...

09:18.160 --> 09:21.687
...who've all been processed into this
facility within the last three months.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.167
Got a munitions expert, special forces.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.691
I'm counting eight guys here.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.168
Khalid Sankar, Yemeni medic,
Jonah Rodriguez, ex-marine...

09:29.360 --> 09:32.250
...and Cyrus Choy,
he's a Red Pole enforcer out of Taiwan.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.124
He's got an entire team in place.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.731
What the hell is he doing?

09:49.480 --> 09:50.925
Go!

09:51.360 --> 09:52.441
Go!

09:52.920 --> 09:54.445
Sir.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.482
Nest command to ACR,
block B has been breached.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.170
We need tactical reinforcement.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.920
Sir, we just lost video!

10:06.320 --> 10:07.367
Camera 2 is down!

10:14.680 --> 10:16.364
- We got a problem.
- We got gas.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.688
We got smoke!

10:56.760 --> 10:59.286
Gotta turn you back!
We're in a full-facility lockdown!

10:59.480 --> 11:01.881
We've had a breach!
Detainee has taken... Aah!

11:09.760 --> 11:11.888
Weapons on the ground!
Weapons on the ground now!

11:12.080 --> 11:13.445
Weapons on the ground now!

11:13.640 --> 11:14.721
Easy!

11:32.800 --> 11:35.531
Desmond to deck command,
prisoner for transport, come back.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.930
That $50,000 is still on the table,
Desmond. It's yours for the taking.

11:40.120 --> 11:43.408
All you gotta do is help me
to help you stay alive.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.329
You sure about this?

11:51.720 --> 11:53.210
Do it.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.445
Eagle, eagle, this is major.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.688
We have breach alert.
Please authenticate.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.281
Eagle, eagle, this is major.
We have breach alert.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.960
- Please authenticate.
- The eagle's dead.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.810
Identify yourself.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.889
I'm the man
who took over your gulag...

12:22.080 --> 12:26.881
...and you're gonna put me in touch
with somebody who matters. Clear?

12:42.240 --> 12:43.844
- Samar.
- Ressler...

12:44.040 --> 12:46.327
...I can't put any weight on my foot.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.726
Horrible, isn't it?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.445
This room.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.565
This is where all the prisoners come
to die, after you break their minds.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.366
They're led here like cattle
for you to slaughter.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.325
When they put down your rebellion, pal...

12:59.520 --> 13:02.763
...you're gonna take my place up here,
I swear.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.167
Hey!

13:05.360 --> 13:07.169
Get on your feet! Get your feet!

13:07.760 --> 13:10.411
Get on your feet! Get on your feet!

13:10.640 --> 13:12.722
Stay! Get on your feet!

13:16.080 --> 13:18.162
Sir! Sir, we have a situation.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.402
We've lost contact with Agent Keen.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.126
- Ressler? Navabi?
- Nothing since they touched down.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.886
I reached out to Langley.
The entire facility is dark.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.004
We've got Braxton.
The CIA's patching him through.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.527
This is Agent Rosenberg,
our hostage negotiator.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.850
Tread lightly, Agent Rosenberg.
Those are my people inside.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.366
Understood. They'll be fine.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.131
We're gonna take our time,
hear what he has to say...

13:39.320 --> 13:41.209
...and get everyone out alive.
You ready?

13:46.000 --> 13:49.129
Mr. Braxton,
this is Agent Phillip Rosenberg.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.608
The director of NCS has instructed me
to open a dialogue with you.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.529
We're not having a dialogue.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.087
I'm hereto listen,
but I need to talk to the warden.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.682
I need to make sure that he's okay
and can confirm the hostages are okay.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.769
No, you are a water boy...

14:02.960 --> 14:04.962
...a bureaucrat
with a stack of cue cards.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.481
Just need to talk to the warden.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.163
Of course you do. Protocol.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.368
I have him right here.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.961
This is Warden Mills.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.208
Mr. Mills, everyone's okay?

14:19.400 --> 14:22.370
Some casualties, but all accounted for.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.528
That's terrific.
Glad to hear your voice.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.202
See that, Mr. Braxton?
I just wanted to talk to the warden.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.769
Mr. Mills? Warden?

14:39.240 --> 14:42.164
- Mr. Mills?
- I'm done talking to you, Mr. Rosenberg.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.880
I wanna speak to somebody
of real authority.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.331
This is Harold Cooper,
assistant director for the FBI.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.005
Hello, Harold Cooper.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.770
I'm pretty sure you see how this works.
I get what I need, or somebody dies.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.162
From here on forward...

15:03.440 --> 15:05.602
...I am the warden.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.370
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came to help get you out.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.164
You came out of curiosity.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.931
Or maybe I actually care
about what happens to you.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.609
- Your government is being robbed.
- From here? How? What's he after?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.290
The Fulcrum.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.209
I don't know what that is. What is that?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.370
It's a blackmail file,
proof of the existence...

15:47.560 --> 15:50.803
...of an extraordinarily powerful
clandestine organization.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.209
If their activities were made public,
some of the most powerful...

15:54.400 --> 15:57.802
...and influential men would go to prison
or be executed.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.207
And it's here, this Fulcrum?

16:04.240 --> 16:05.844
No, The Fulcrum isn't here...

16:06.040 --> 16:08.441
...but information critical
to finding it is...

16:08.640 --> 16:11.689
...and that's what Braxton wants.
But I'm here to stop it.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.929
- I can help you.
- No, you need to leave.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.526
Ressler and Samar
have been taken hostage.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.451
They shouldn't even be here.
You never should've come here.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.290
Why didn't you come to us?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.050
Why don't you want me here?

16:25.240 --> 16:27.447
I'll get to Ressler and Samar
as soon as I can.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.928
- You get back on that chopper.
- Not without Ressler and Samar or you.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.005
Now, how are we gonna stop Braxton?
He has an entire team.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.841
Well, sadly, there isn't a prison on earth
where I don't know a few guys.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.201
If Braxton wants the secrets
they beat out of us...

16:46.440 --> 16:50.206
...he's gonna need to get into the server,
which is only accessible from The Nest.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.124
How about during a lockdown?

16:52.360 --> 16:54.010
This facility's like a submarine.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.005
It's compartmentalized.
Can only be shut down by sections.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.403
Security protocols render
the entire server room inaccessible.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.802
How do you know that?
I didn't know that.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.361
Khan has broken out of seven prisons.
This will be eight.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.971
This server room, where is it?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.924
Northwest quadrant, basement.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.840
We can't get you inside,
but the German, he has an idea.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.566
Who is she? Who is this girl?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.040
She's with me.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.161
Your idea?

17:23.760 --> 17:25.603
The boiler room.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.807
It's located next to the server room.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.721
If you could get there,
you could reprogram it to overload.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.002
The pressure
would cause an explosion.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.521
- That would blow up the server room?
- If you're lucky...

17:39.560 --> 17:44.168
...it will take out the server room. If
you're unlucky, the whole prison craters.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.691
"If you could get there."

17:45.880 --> 17:50.124
Yes, the only way into the boiler room
undetected is through a single air duct.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.680
It's less than 24 inches square.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.244
Looks like I'm the tunnel rat.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.049
All right.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.322
Khan will guide you to the boiler room.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.966
Gernert and I will be waiting for you
to let us in...

18:04.160 --> 18:06.686
...then you'll reprogram the system.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.325
What about me? What's my job?

18:08.560 --> 18:11.160
You don't have one. You're here
because of what your cartel did...

18:11.200 --> 18:13.931
...to Felix Moralez
and my people in Reynosa.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.323
Okay. Shall we go to work?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.570
Braxton, you need to see this.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.880
Approximately...

18:50.560 --> 18:53.040
I'm sorry. The warden can't get
to the phone right now.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.402
May I please take a message?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.126
Nothing?

18:57.360 --> 18:59.089
Not a "Hello, how are you?"

18:59.680 --> 19:01.842
Say something, Luther.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.241
Reddington.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.808
- That's me.
- You're locked out, Red.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.361
I have complete control
over this hellhole.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.121
I'm confident you've got a plan
for every imaginable scenario...

19:13.320 --> 19:17.041
...but it's the scenarios you can't imagine
that bite you in the ass, Luther...

19:17.240 --> 19:19.163
...like me here.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.045
Do you think this is something
that snuck up on me?

19:22.240 --> 19:23.651
After Belgrade?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.010
Belgrade.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.806
Boy, things got nasty in Belgrade,
didn't they?

19:30.000 --> 19:34.164
It's funny, up until then,
I was aimless, just an ordinary thief.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.483
But after Belgrade,
I became known as the man...

19:37.680 --> 19:41.082
...who bested the great Ray Reddington.
- You didn't best me, Luther.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.641
You butchered, clawed your way
into my pockets...

19:43.840 --> 19:45.922
...and innocent people died
in the process.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.606
You're such a snob, Red.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.406
Always considered yourself
above the fray...

19:51.600 --> 19:55.366
...with your handmade suits
and your fancy wine, your private jets.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.642
Do you even drive?

19:58.360 --> 20:03.207
You got everybody convinced
you're so hard, Red, but I know better.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.206
You're soft.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.489
You're not getting The Fulcrum.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.722
And how you gonna stop me, Red?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.524
Bore me to death with Beethoven?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.722
Put me to sleep quoting Nietzsche?

20:13.920 --> 20:15.251
Come on.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.211
We both know that in order to stop me,
you gotta have balls.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.204
You gotta run the gauntlet.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.011
And after Belgrade, well...

20:25.040 --> 20:26.565
...that's just not gonna happen.

20:26.760 --> 20:29.127
So tell me,
how are you gonna stop me, Red?

20:29.320 --> 20:32.449
"A wise man can learn more
from a foolish question...

20:32.640 --> 20:34.802
...than a fool can learn
from a wise answer."

20:36.160 --> 20:37.241
Was that Nietzsche?

20:37.440 --> 20:40.250
No. Bruce Lee.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.730
This man has an abdominal wound.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.331
He's going to die.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.320
Who forgives and does the right thing
will be rewarded by Allah.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.721
Please!

20:55.920 --> 20:57.445
Let him down.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.325
Damn it, let him down!

21:11.640 --> 21:14.166
Okay, Harold, let's test your reflexes.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.931
This facility has been put
into lockdown, meaning...

21:17.120 --> 21:20.283
...all existing codes that ran this prison
have been invalidated.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.404
- We're aware of that.
- Good, then you must also be aware...

21:23.600 --> 21:26.126
...that one code has been generated
by the mainframe...

21:26.320 --> 21:31.406
...a master code giving the CIA
and any rescue units all access.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.210
- I want it.
- Understood.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.291
I can get my people working
on that right away.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.929
Okay. Your reflexes, Harold? Shabby.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.801
Mine, however...

21:46.000 --> 21:47.889
...lightning quick.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.888
You just cost
an innocent woman her life...

21:51.120 --> 21:53.851
...which means we 'II just have
to get ourselves another one.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.127
Let me set the scene...

21:55.320 --> 21:58.483
...just like them old radio dramas
your granny used to listen to.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.361
I'm standing in front of a tall...

22:01.560 --> 22:03.244
...fit...

22:03.800 --> 22:05.882
...very attractive Persian girl...

22:06.560 --> 22:08.562
...by the name of...

22:10.240 --> 22:11.480
...Samar Navabi.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.321
Maybe you're familiar with her.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.730
Anyway, Miss Navabi has a noose
around her neck...

22:18.920 --> 22:21.651
...her very long, lovely neck...

22:21.840 --> 22:25.322
...which is about to get a lot longer
unless you give me the code.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.330
I'll give you 10 minutes.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.130
We're gonna give the code, right?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.565
Sir, I'm sorry,
but you have to give the code.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.041
It's a black site. Nobody will know
we're negotiating. I'm sorry, but...

22:44.840 --> 22:46.410
...we're gonna give the code!

22:46.600 --> 22:49.683
I am not allowing that maniac
to lynch one of my agents.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.566
You can't give him the code.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.366
You know the protocol.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.080
That negotiator gave me
all the relevant details...

22:57.280 --> 23:00.250
...including the master code.
Why wouldn't I give it to him?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.528
Braxton doesn't want the code
to break out.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.848
He wants it to break into our network.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.647
What network?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.367
The Factory isn't just a black site.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.403
It's a level-six intelligence node.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.570
It communicates with Langley,
Pentagon, White House Sit Room.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.526
The intel being squeezed out of these
targets, our highest-level targets...

23:19.720 --> 23:21.006
...is mission-critical.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.487
We needed our interrogators
and our operatives...

23:23.680 --> 23:27.207
...working together in real time,
so we removed any latency...

23:27.400 --> 23:30.802
...between the time we received a lead
and our ability to act on it.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.890
You put an access point
to the country's most sensitive data...

23:34.080 --> 23:37.289
...in a prison with the country's
most dangerous enemies?

23:37.520 --> 23:38.681
Yes.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.564
Which is why I am asking you...

23:41.040 --> 23:43.247
...do not release that code.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.561
Sir, Braxton's back online.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.685
- Cooper.
- The code.

23:58.880 --> 24:01.804
What assurance do I have
that no hostages will be harmed?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.326
None.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.127
The code.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.964
You hear that sound, Harold?

24:20.200 --> 24:22.885
That's the sound
of Agent Navabi's neck being broken.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.890
- Please. Stop.
- The code.

24:31.160 --> 24:36.007
Dallas, Foxtrot, one, Charlie,
three, seven, two. Now let...

24:38.400 --> 24:39.561
Braxton?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.808
Braxton, respond.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.924
Are you enjoying inflicting this pain?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.690
Pray to your God he lets you live.

24:55.880 --> 24:56.881
Answer me.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.289
If the person deserves it, then yes.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.164
We've done nothing
to deserve this torture.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.330
You're FBI. You did more than enough.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.802
Please. Allah is ever-pardoning,
ever-forgiving.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.651
- We're ready here.
- Good. Get to the server room.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.884
I'll radio you
once the system's back online.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.126
- Where are we?
- I have attacked this from every angle.

25:36.320 --> 25:40.006
Once Braxton reboots the servers, he'll
have access to the intelligence network.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.884
- How do we lock him out?
- We can't...

25:42.080 --> 25:44.890
...not without flipping the switch on the
entire network, and he knows we won't.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.402
- What would that entail?
- Our DOD satellites shutting down...

25:48.600 --> 25:50.762
...a temporary loss
of real-time communications.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.328
- So CENTCOM would go dark.
- Assuming we could get authorization...

25:55.000 --> 25:57.480
...it would take hours to shut it down.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.325
Once you make that last turn...

26:02.520 --> 26:04.090
...it's about 10 more feet.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.568
- You'll see a vent there going down.
- Yeah, I think I see it. I'm here.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.171
Follow that, and you're in.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.726
Braxton, we're in.

26:19.920 --> 26:24.289
Dallas, Foxtrot, one, Charlie,
three, seven, two.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.047
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.687
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.571
Have you ever heard
of Bruno Ashmanskis?

26:52.760 --> 26:56.845
The most skilled cat burglar I've ever
had the pleasure of working with.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.122
Bruno mostly did jobs
on commission...

26:59.320 --> 27:02.449
...but he wanted to do something
for himself, something special...

27:02.680 --> 27:04.808
...so he got it into his head to break...

27:05.000 --> 27:07.526
...into the Fitzwilliam Museum
in Cambridge...

27:07.720 --> 27:13.409
...to steal an imperial vase
from the Ching dynasty worth millions.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.365
The single biggest trophy of his career.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.801
- What happened?
- I never heard from him again.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.764
I'd always assumed he'd succeeded...

27:20.960 --> 27:26.490
...that he was sipping some umbrella-clad
cocktail on a beach in Tahiti...

27:26.680 --> 27:31.527
...until five years later during a remodel
of the Fitzwilliam, they removed a wall.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.610
There was poor Bruno...
What was left of him, anyway.

27:34.840 --> 27:39.607
...Stuck inside a heating duct,
still clutching that vase.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.242
I prefer to think of old Bruno
on that beach in Tahiti.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.363
We have a problem.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.047
What?

27:49.360 --> 27:52.045
Our asset is tracking the extent
of the breach.

27:52.240 --> 27:55.528
It appears that Braxton's team
has penetrated your country's network.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.961
We have confirmation
on what they're looking for?

27:58.160 --> 28:00.561
Yes, we do. The Fulcrum.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.842
So Reddington does not have it.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.281
I never believed he did, actually...

28:05.480 --> 28:09.246
...and his efforts to stop Braxton
only confirmed my suspicions.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.842
- What's our collateral exposure?
- Honestly? None.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.526
We are mirroring
Braxton's search algorithms...

28:15.720 --> 28:18.451
...and if the Fulcrum comes into play,
we will find it.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.404
So Mr. Braxton is a liability?

28:20.600 --> 28:23.683
Oh, yes, and Mr. Reddington
may no longer be a threat.

28:23.880 --> 28:28.124
We haven't touched him for fear
that he'd use The Fulcrum as a...

28:28.320 --> 28:30.971
Well, to expose us, but he's bluffing.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.685
You can't be sure of that.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.609
Alan Fitch did not think so.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.202
Whether he is or not, it's a moot point.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.169
He needs to be eliminated.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.006
This prison of yours, The Factory...

28:43.240 --> 28:47.211
...I understand the American public
is unaware of its existence.

28:47.400 --> 28:53.248
Perhaps they would not notice
if it were to disappear.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.402
- How much longer?
- We've had a setback.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.250
Gernert is working on alternatives.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.091
I'm telling you,
there are no other options.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.760
This model has redundant
computerized safeguards.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.247
If I attempt to over-pressurize
the boiler tank...

29:09.440 --> 29:11.363
...those safeguards kick in
automatically.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.682
There's nothing you can do
to override it?

29:13.880 --> 29:17.168
It would have to be done manually.
That means someone standing here...

29:17.400 --> 29:20.210
...resetting those pressure-relief valves
every 90 seconds...

29:20.440 --> 29:22.727
...while someone else mans
temperature controls...

29:22.920 --> 29:27.244
...until this pressure cooker hits 700 psi,
and that is not gonna be me.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.486
You're not going anywhere.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.364
Yeah, I am.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.131
Because whoever stays here
to do this manually...

29:35.320 --> 29:37.527
...is gonna be blown
into a million pieces.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.960
- Or just one.
- Wait.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.571
You shoot him, they'll hear.

29:40.760 --> 29:44.287
They'll be here within 60 seconds,
and then what?

29:46.120 --> 29:49.522
We can do this, you and I.

29:53.720 --> 29:57.088
After the pressure reaches 700,
how long do we have until it explodes?

29:57.280 --> 29:59.806
Anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds...

30:00.000 --> 30:02.367
...but there's no way to know for sure.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.564
You're better off walking away now.

30:09.960 --> 30:10.961
Good luck.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.881
Heh, Red, you know that after Delhi,
I'd do anything for you...

30:17.120 --> 30:20.283
...but you'd be lucky to get off this rig,
and whatever your plan is...

30:20.480 --> 30:22.289
...I'm not a part of it.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.403
I've helped you. I've done my piece.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.490
Way I see it, we're even for Delhi.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.405
We can do this.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.565
If we don't stop this,

30:35.760 --> 30:37.410
the death toll isn't going to
be in the dozens...

30:37.640 --> 30:39.051
...it'll be in the thousands...

30:39.240 --> 30:41.925
...and the world is gonna look
quite different...

30:42.120 --> 30:45.567
...with Braxton in control
of all our servers.

30:45.760 --> 30:51.483
Every operative, every analyst,
every case officer in his pocket.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.571
And Mr. Cooper has given him
the keys to our kingdom.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.564
We have to make sure
he never has the chance to use them.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.762
We have federal agents on site.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.684
Buy me more time.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.724
Let me activate an extraction team.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.371
No.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.521
No, just order the strike.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.564
Yes, sir.

31:13.920 --> 31:18.164
I'll have planes in the air within the
hour. The target will be destroyed.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.610
Sir, you gotta see this.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.441
I just got confirmation that two F-22s
were scrambled out of Wright-Patterson.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.369
They're headed toward The Factory.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.962
- ETA to target?
- Twenty-four minutes.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.564
Get Kat Goodson. Now.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.721
Braxton, accessing information now.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.321
One.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.167
Two.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.485
Three.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.200
Six-fifty psi.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.721
A few more, and the boiler blows.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.289
When are you gonna tell me the truth?

32:27.480 --> 32:29.642
- What truth?
- About why you came here.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.450
The blackmail file, The Fulcrum.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.963
I can't allow Braxton to get it.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.721
Why? What difference does it make
to you if he gets it and exposes this...

32:37.920 --> 32:39.570
Cabal?

32:42.760 --> 32:45.570
The group believes I have it.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.408
It's one of the reasons I'm still alive.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.531
So if Braxton gets it,
they'll know you don't have it...

32:51.720 --> 32:53.688
...and they'll kill you, is that it?

33:12.360 --> 33:14.203
- What's the number?
- Six-eighty.

33:18.040 --> 33:21.089
So that's what this is about,
this whole thing?

33:21.280 --> 33:22.361
Protecting yourself?

33:24.960 --> 33:28.931
It may be hard for you to imagine,
but I once had a relatively normal life.

33:29.120 --> 33:35.924
Bills to pay, play dates, family,
some friends, people to care about.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.046
Lost all that.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.482
Lost how?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.810
In Mexico, there are these fish...

33:46.040 --> 33:49.249
...that have colonized
the freshwater caves...

33:49.440 --> 33:50.930
...along the Sierra del Abra.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.850
They were lost.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.681
They found themselves living
in complete darkness.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.085
But they didn't die.
Instead, they thrived.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.123
They adapted.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.686
They lost their pigmentation,
their sight...

34:06.880 --> 34:10.009
...eventually even their eyes.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.364
With survival, they became...

34:13.560 --> 34:15.369
...hideous.

34:17.639 --> 34:23.010
I've rarely thought
about what I once was.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.407
But I wonder...

34:30.520 --> 34:33.728
...if a ray of light were to make it
into the cave...

34:33.960 --> 34:36.531
...would I be able to see it?

34:36.760 --> 34:38.250
Or feel it?

34:38.440 --> 34:42.889
Would I gravitate to its warmth?

34:45.159 --> 34:47.288
And if I did...

34:47.520 --> 34:49.648
...would I become...

34:51.600 --> 34:53.841
...less hideous?

34:57.040 --> 35:01.443
I didn't want you to come here,
follow me here.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.042
Because the truth is,
if I don't stop Braxton...

35:05.240 --> 35:08.449
...what he'll discover is that
he can't get The Fulcrum without you.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.167
What does that mean, "without me"?

35:33.080 --> 35:34.605
Get out of here!

35:52.920 --> 35:54.843
- What the hell is that?
- We're offline.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.486
Get down to the server room,
see what's going on.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.610
Red?

36:20.520 --> 36:21.567
Reddington?

36:23.480 --> 36:24.766
Oh, God.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.605
Breathe.

36:33.480 --> 36:34.561
Oh, my God.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.524
Red, breathe.

36:43.480 --> 36:46.165
Breathe, you son of a bitch!

36:47.080 --> 36:49.321
Down here! The boiler room!

37:00.120 --> 37:01.849
Take her to Braxton.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.241
Paper-dog, we are 10-zero minutes
from primary target.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.681
Requesting authorization
to arm and engage.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.126
You can't let this happen.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.322
Don't put this on me.
You gave up that code.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.842
You have three federal agents
and at least 40 innocent hostages...

37:24.040 --> 37:27.408
...in that facility. Inmates included,
over a hundred lives will be lost.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.962
I don't agree with this course of action,
but I understand it.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.970
It's damage control because you
couldn't make the tough call.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.527
We don't even know
what Braxton's after.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.167
What the hell is so important
in that database...

37:39.400 --> 37:43.086
...that someone wants to kill those people
on the chance that he might get it?

37:43.320 --> 37:45.846
- I won't just roll with this.
- What are you gonna do?

37:46.040 --> 37:49.362
Go to the Post? The Times?

37:49.560 --> 37:52.166
This whole operation is deep black.
It doesn't exist.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.524
Every trace will be incinerated the
moment Reddington's a confirmed kill.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.688
You know what happens
to whistle-blowers...

37:58.920 --> 38:00.968
...kooks, paranoid freaks.

38:01.160 --> 38:04.130
You'll be a keynote speaker
in their next woo-woo convention...

38:04.320 --> 38:07.244
...and your people will be just as dead.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.283
Reddington, get up.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.768
You gotta get up, Red.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.766
Where is she?

38:24.960 --> 38:26.291
Where is she?

38:33.960 --> 38:35.724
Who the hell are you?

38:35.920 --> 38:38.844
The server's gone. She blew it up.

38:39.080 --> 38:42.289
- Carl is dead and so are the others.
- Get Beck and Wolcott on it.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.404
You don't understand.
The prisoners are loose.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.046
If they find out we have a chopper,
we'll have a real problem.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.163
We need to go now.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.889
Where's Reddington?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.809
He's dead.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.925
Ah, I count at least a dozen cells
destroyed.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.720
We've got inmates in the
southeast quad.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.923
You seem like a decent guy, Desmond.
Do something else for a living.

39:17.160 --> 39:20.642
The animals are loose. You can't get
to The Nest without going through them.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.763
They'll kill you.
What are you gonna do?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.240
I'm gonna get her back.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.327
Hey!

39:34.400 --> 39:37.051
I'm talking to you!
I'm gonna need that shotgun.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.487
It's over. The server's destroyed.

39:54.680 --> 39:58.241
Sir, we got reports of gunfire
in the north hall.

39:58.440 --> 40:02.365
- We can't raise anyone on the comms.
- Reddington.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.724
Head him off.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.328
Get the chopper.
Let Yousef handle the hostages.

40:21.280 --> 40:25.251
Paper-dog, ETA two minutes.
Making final approach to target.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.283
All this, and you don't even know
what the hell you're looking for.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.767
- I know what it's worth.
- It's not what you think.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.804
It's not a golden ticket.
It's a target on your back.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.241
I know all the stories, Red.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.442
I know where it was 20 years ago,
and I know when it disappeared.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.647
I know about the house,
the fire, the girl.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.085
Sir, I just got word.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.562
The missiles have been launched.
Impact in 30 seconds.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.171
No wonder you came for her.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.208
She was there that night, wasn't she?

42:19.760 --> 42:21.000
She's the one?

42:21.480 --> 42:22.481
Shoot him.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.650
Shoot him.
