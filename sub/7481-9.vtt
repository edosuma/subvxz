<i>A heist crew</i>

04:38.074 --> 04:41.068
wreaked havoc at the LA Live
Entertainment Center today,

04:41.070 --> 04:42.710
knocking over an armored truck.

04:42.712 --> 04:45.858
Thanks to traffic cams and
the smart phone revolution,

04:45.860 --> 04:48.431
we've got plenty of footage
of what went down.

04:48.433 --> 04:50.548
They used the tourist traffic
to their advantage.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.936
Looks like the circus

04:51.939 --> 04:53.476
is in town.

04:53.478 --> 04:55.067
These guys are pros.

04:55.069 --> 04:57.515
Fast, organized, and ruthless.

04:57.517 --> 05:00.231
Fortunately, one of the guards
inside the truck survived,

05:00.233 --> 05:01.992
despite suffering a head wound.

05:01.993 --> 05:03.215
What was the cargo?

05:03.217 --> 05:05.126
100 Good Delivery gold bars,

05:05.128 --> 05:07.976
the type used
in major international markets,

05:07.978 --> 05:09.452
central banks, and the IMF.

05:09.454 --> 05:11.514
The bars were en route
from the Federal Reserve

05:11.516 --> 05:13.861
to the People's Bank of China.
How much we talking?

05:13.863 --> 05:16.241
The gold bars
weigh 12.4 kilos.

05:16.243 --> 05:18.723
At $1,750 an ounce...

05:18.725 --> 05:22.058
That's $700,000 a bar
or roughly...

05:22.061 --> 05:23.418
$70 million.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.010
Just got a gold rush.

05:25.012 --> 05:26.300
What are we buying?

05:26.302 --> 05:28.362
Time.

05:28.364 --> 05:30.291
The gold is an interest payment

05:30.293 --> 05:33.677
on a trillion dollar plus loan
we have with China.

05:33.679 --> 05:37.346
If we can't recover it,
well, let's just say

05:37.348 --> 05:40.062
we don't want them
to repossess Hawaii.

05:41.429 --> 05:43.007
So we'll
keep you posted, okay?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.639
Thanks.
Okay.

05:45.641 --> 05:47.384
What do you think?

05:47.386 --> 05:49.145
I think you got
to have some big ones

05:49.147 --> 05:51.713
to pull off a heist like this
in the middle of the day.

05:51.715 --> 05:53.424
Yeah, no joke.
You find anything useful?

05:53.426 --> 05:55.399
Not yet. You?

05:55.401 --> 05:57.669
They had to have
left something.

05:57.671 --> 06:00.121
ATM, traffic,
security cams--

06:00.123 --> 06:02.508
it's an odd location
for a heist.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.894
There's more surveillance
than LAX.

06:04.896 --> 06:07.049
The motor home stops here.

06:07.051 --> 06:09.353
Blocks off the armored car.

06:09.355 --> 06:12.315
Bozo bounds from the curb.

06:12.317 --> 06:16.100
Captain Sparrow wannabe points
his assault rifle,

06:16.102 --> 06:18.157
then monkey boy
pulls up the cargo van.

06:18.159 --> 06:19.728
Pretty sure
it was actually a gorilla.

06:19.730 --> 06:21.249
Monkeys usually have tails.

06:21.251 --> 06:23.255
They can't swing from branch
to branch like apes can.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.261
They also can't drive
a cargo van.

06:25.263 --> 06:27.769
I saw one drive a motorcycle
one time, so he probably could.

06:27.771 --> 06:30.360
And I knew one that worked
in a bar in Huntington Beach

06:30.362 --> 06:32.316
who could make a martini.

06:32.318 --> 06:34.038
I'm not saying it was
a good martini.

06:38.636 --> 06:40.508
We got blood.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.748
He could have jumped into
their car or grabbed a cab.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.874
Or dumped his disguise
and lost himself in the crowd.

06:58.279 --> 06:59.681
Aw, damn!

06:59.683 --> 07:01.621
You got to be kidding me.
What?

07:07.423 --> 07:09.163
I hate clowns.

07:09.165 --> 07:12.952
Yep, not nearly as funny
when they're dead, are they?

07:26.653 --> 07:30.312
This clown is Clive Mayfield.

07:30.314 --> 07:31.591
He's a well-known criminal

07:31.592 --> 07:33.058
who's bounced around the country
with a number

07:33.060 --> 07:34.542
of different heist crews.

07:34.544 --> 07:36.798
He did time for armed robbery
at USP Atlanta.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.218
We put together
a list of former associates,

07:39.220 --> 07:40.799
some of whom are
from the LA area.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.652
Hopefully one or more
were involved in the heist

07:42.654 --> 07:44.184
and can lead us to the gold.

07:44.186 --> 07:45.716
What's the word
on the guard he shot?

07:45.718 --> 07:48.005
Lucky. Hospital says
he's up and around.

07:48.007 --> 07:49.586
Kensi's on her way
to talk to him.

07:49.588 --> 07:51.311
Well, hopefully he can
tell us something.

07:51.313 --> 07:53.488
Sam and I will run down
Clive Mayfield

07:53.490 --> 07:55.422
and his criminal buddies.

07:55.424 --> 07:58.132
Maybe we'll get lucky, too.

07:58.134 --> 08:00.824
Uh, where is Sam?

08:00.826 --> 08:03.695
He's... dealing with something.

08:07.115 --> 08:09.297
Coulrophobia.

08:09.299 --> 08:11.104
Fear of clowns?

08:11.106 --> 08:13.960
Is that even a real thing?

08:13.962 --> 08:15.486
It is with Sam.

08:15.488 --> 08:17.342
Weird.

08:17.344 --> 08:19.476
Oh, yeah.

08:22.843 --> 08:24.959
You don't, uh,

08:24.961 --> 08:27.800
have any irrational phobias
I should know about, do you?

08:27.802 --> 08:29.195
Well...

08:29.197 --> 08:31.740
do you think hand puppets
are creepy?

08:31.742 --> 08:34.251
Not particularly.

08:34.253 --> 08:37.125
Yeah, me neither.

08:37.126 --> 08:39.014
Ventriloquist dummies,
on the other hand...

08:39.015 --> 08:41.934
Creepy, right?
Totally.

08:41.937 --> 08:43.182
I used to have this nightmare

08:43.183 --> 08:44.267
when I first
started working here.

08:44.269 --> 08:46.516
It's the middle
of the night.

08:46.518 --> 08:48.272
I'm here all alone.

08:48.274 --> 08:51.277
I come up to Ops...

08:51.279 --> 08:55.168
and there's somebody sitting
in the shadows.

08:57.473 --> 09:00.295
And I can't see their face
'cause they're...

09:00.297 --> 09:01.854
they're turned away from me,

09:01.856 --> 09:05.138
but I can tell that there's...

09:05.140 --> 09:07.765
There's something in their lap,

09:07.767 --> 09:11.508
and I want to run,
but I can't.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.201
And slowly they turn around,

09:14.203 --> 09:16.384
and I see what they're holding.

09:16.386 --> 09:19.750
It's...

09:19.752 --> 09:21.895
Hetty.

09:23.235 --> 09:25.465
The Treasury Department
is about to have

09:25.467 --> 09:27.559
a China Syndrome meltdown.

09:27.561 --> 09:30.425
So if you don't want
your paychecks

09:30.427 --> 09:34.218
to bounce this week...

09:34.220 --> 09:38.319
I suggest you forgo story time
and get cracking.

09:38.321 --> 09:41.460
We are... cracking.

09:41.462 --> 09:44.721
Crack, crack, cracking.

09:53.133 --> 09:56.444
That was weird.

10:01.164 --> 10:04.166
Do you two need to be separated?

10:04.168 --> 10:06.501
No.

10:06.503 --> 10:08.543
No.

10:08.545 --> 10:10.743
Federal agents!

10:15.474 --> 10:16.671
Clear.

10:16.673 --> 10:18.346
Looks like Clive Mayfield

10:18.348 --> 10:19.743
left in a hurry.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.433
Yeah, $70 million,

10:21.435 --> 10:24.010
I'd be on my way
to my own private island.

10:24.012 --> 10:25.654
What, you don't spend
enough time alone?

10:25.656 --> 10:27.624
You know what I'm gonna do?

10:27.626 --> 10:29.708
I'm gonna buy you a yacht,
so you can come visit me.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.975
Make it a private jet
and I just might.

10:31.977 --> 10:33.420
You'd buy a jet?

10:33.422 --> 10:35.013
No, I'd make you buy me a jet.

10:35.015 --> 10:36.819
I'd open up an auto body shop.

10:36.821 --> 10:39.775
$70 million, and you're gonna
become a mechanic?

10:39.777 --> 10:41.532
Auto science specialist.

10:41.534 --> 10:42.845
It's a calling.

10:42.847 --> 10:44.422
I'd open a place

10:44.424 --> 10:46.064
where people could go
without getting ripped off.

10:46.066 --> 10:48.150
Yeah, no need for cars
on the island.

10:48.152 --> 10:50.941
What, you and Gilligan gonna
build a bike out of coconuts?

10:50.943 --> 10:53.044
Think there's anything
in there?

10:53.046 --> 10:54.520
Nope.

10:54.522 --> 10:56.162
What, is this for
hamsters or something?

10:56.164 --> 10:57.673
Only if they're food.

10:57.675 --> 10:59.594
This is for a snake.

10:59.596 --> 11:01.893
By the size of this tank,
I'd say a big one.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.667
You think the owner took it
with him?

11:05.064 --> 11:07.280
I sure as hell hope so.

11:07.282 --> 11:08.560
You seen enough?

11:08.562 --> 11:09.545
Oh, yeah.

11:09.547 --> 11:10.941
Yeah.

11:11.927 --> 11:13.415
G?

11:13.417 --> 11:14.469
It's okay.

11:14.471 --> 11:17.062
Just a false alarm.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.313
Jack?

11:48.315 --> 11:49.885
Jack Williams?

11:49.887 --> 11:51.826
Yeah, that's what
they're telling me.

11:51.828 --> 11:53.533
I'm Special Agent Blye.

11:53.535 --> 11:56.075
I was hoping to talk to you
about the robbery this morning.

11:56.077 --> 11:59.254
I watched it on the news but
I... I still don't remember it.

11:59.256 --> 12:01.897
It's not unusual
in traumatic situations.

12:01.899 --> 12:04.792
Yeah, they said that, too.

12:04.794 --> 12:07.837
They also said
I'm lucky to be alive, but...

12:07.839 --> 12:10.144
I don't feel too lucky.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.909
You may feel it's insignificant,

12:13.911 --> 12:16.318
but any little detail
that you could recall

12:16.320 --> 12:18.174
from this morning's heist
would be useful.

12:18.176 --> 12:21.554
Accent of the thieves,
jargon they used,

12:21.556 --> 12:23.947
even the smell of their cologne
would be helpful.

12:23.949 --> 12:27.075
They say I killed a man.

12:27.077 --> 12:30.555
And I don't remember
firing my gun.

12:30.557 --> 12:33.098
I don't remember anything.

12:35.190 --> 12:37.414
You see that woman
and those kids?

12:39.456 --> 12:42.433
They say that's my wife
and-and children.

12:43.856 --> 12:47.904
But I don't recognize them.

12:49.962 --> 12:51.751
I'm sorry.

12:51.754 --> 12:54.260
No, I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

12:54.262 --> 12:56.736
Look, I'd like to help you,

12:56.738 --> 12:58.643
but I can't.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.667
And to be honest, I...

13:00.669 --> 13:04.600
All I want to do right now is
just remember who the hell I am.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.710
Okay.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.476
Jack...

13:11.478 --> 13:14.514
when you do remember
something.

13:25.964 --> 13:27.922
Well?

13:29.499 --> 13:32.236
He says he doesn't
remember anything.

13:32.238 --> 13:33.596
You believe him?

13:33.598 --> 13:35.389
Sounds pretty convincing.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.243
That heist was
pretty damn slick.

13:38.245 --> 13:40.367
It'd pay to have a man
on the inside.

13:40.369 --> 13:41.695
They shot him in the head.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.637
What better way
to cover your tracks.

13:43.638 --> 13:45.844
That would explain
the sudden amnesia.

13:46.873 --> 13:49.411
Put a guard on him.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.485
In case he runs?

13:51.487 --> 13:53.559
Or they come back
and finish the job.

13:53.561 --> 13:56.497
Copy that.

13:56.499 --> 13:58.073
So, I'll see you back at Ops?

13:58.075 --> 13:59.732
Nice try-- you're my ride.

13:59.734 --> 14:03.014
Besides, you and I could use
some quality time.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.251
Awesome.

14:16.013 --> 14:17.669
Yeah, what do
you got, Nell?

14:17.671 --> 14:20.288
I got a hit
on a clown costume.

14:21.201 --> 14:22.858
Yeah, pass that
one on to Kensi.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.317
She can check it out
on her way back.

14:24.318 --> 14:26.256
Also, can you run a search
of recent purchases

14:26.258 --> 14:27.931
of snake supplies
in the area?

14:27.933 --> 14:28.958
What kind of snake?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.617
- A big one.
- Okay.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.192
Thanks.

14:32.194 --> 14:33.882
I know
it's irrational.

14:33.884 --> 14:35.540
I didn't say anything.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.789
Assistant Director,

14:40.791 --> 14:42.899
do you not trust me
to handle this on my own?

14:42.901 --> 14:45.180
Don't like being under the
microscope, Agent Blye?

14:45.182 --> 14:46.362
No, it's not that--

14:46.364 --> 14:48.507
Because you are.
What?

14:48.509 --> 14:49.824
I'm kidding.

14:49.826 --> 14:51.312
Okay, you're
a very busy man.

14:51.314 --> 14:53.761
I'm just maintaining
protocol, Agent Blye.

14:53.763 --> 14:55.398
Don't take it personally.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.508
Besides, performance
reviews are due.

14:57.510 --> 14:59.586
Oh...
Great choice.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.275
Comes with tear-away trousers,

15:01.277 --> 15:03.421
bow tie, collar, cuffs.

15:03.423 --> 15:05.244
Six-pack not included.

15:05.246 --> 15:07.778
But we should
have your size.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.077
Nothing like a little

15:09.079 --> 15:12.271
role-play to spice up
the bedroom.

15:16.392 --> 15:17.826
We're Federal agents.

15:17.828 --> 15:19.719
I don't judge.

15:19.721 --> 15:21.778
Uh, yesterday we had
a couple nuns in here,

15:21.780 --> 15:23.991
bought leather cat suits.

15:23.993 --> 15:25.638
All right, that's just weird.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.683
You sold some costumes
to a guy a few days ago:

15:28.685 --> 15:30.895
a gorilla, a clown, a pirate...

15:30.897 --> 15:33.009
No refunds, exchange only.

15:33.011 --> 15:35.887
We don't need a refund--
we need some answers.

15:35.889 --> 15:38.416
Do you recognize
this guy?

15:39.465 --> 15:40.629
Nope.

15:40.631 --> 15:43.075
You recognize him
in your costume?

15:44.906 --> 15:48.066
No exchanges once it's worn.

15:48.068 --> 15:48.931
That guy's dead.

15:48.933 --> 15:50.229
No exceptions.

15:50.231 --> 15:51.410
Who bought the costume?

15:51.412 --> 15:53.140
It wasn't the guy
who was wearing it?

15:53.142 --> 15:55.253
Look...

15:55.255 --> 15:56.584
I sell a lot of costumes.

15:56.586 --> 15:58.797
I'm still restocking
from Halloween.

15:58.799 --> 16:00.544
Okay, we're gonna need your
credit card records then.

16:00.546 --> 16:02.708
Transaction
fees are murder

16:02.710 --> 16:04.870
on a small business
owner-- cash only.

16:04.872 --> 16:07.083
Fine, we'll take your
surveillance tapes.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.331
40 bucks.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.330
We're not buying them from you,

16:09.332 --> 16:10.745
we're Federal Agents.

16:10.747 --> 16:12.028
Okay, 20 bucks.

16:13.078 --> 16:14.059
How about we shut your shop down

16:14.061 --> 16:15.107
for running a meth lab

16:15.109 --> 16:16.440
out of the basement?

16:16.442 --> 16:18.887
Meth lab?!
There's no meth lab here.

16:18.889 --> 16:20.685
Uh, there's no basement here.

16:20.687 --> 16:22.716
Maybe not, but can
a small business owner

16:22.718 --> 16:25.179
such as yourself
survive the red tape?

16:26.346 --> 16:28.227
Hm?

16:31.757 --> 16:34.088
I'll be right back.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.851
Wonderful.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.913
"Grizzled vet," huh?

16:46.658 --> 16:49.543
Meet Duncan Welch,
full-time criminal,

16:49.545 --> 16:51.712
part-time pirate.

16:51.714 --> 16:53.815
His rap sheet reads
like a companion piece

16:53.817 --> 16:55.666
to our dead clown
Clive Mayfield.

16:55.668 --> 16:57.718
Do you think these guys
pick out their own costumes?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.837
Like, maybe two
of 'em wanted

16:59.839 --> 17:01.338
to be the pirate,
and then one of 'em's like,

17:01.340 --> 17:02.973
"I called it," and the other
one's like, "You always

17:02.975 --> 17:05.175
get to be the pirate.
I never get to be the pirate."

17:05.176 --> 17:06.376
And the other one's
like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

17:06.377 --> 17:07.810
"you got to be
the pirate last time.

17:07.813 --> 17:09.096
"This time I'm gonna
be the pirate,

17:09.098 --> 17:10.931
and you get to be
the clown, sucker."

17:13.818 --> 17:16.219
Just, you know, thinking maybe
their choice of disguise

17:16.221 --> 17:18.021
might give you some insight
into these guys.

17:18.023 --> 17:21.108
Psychological profiling
through costume choice?

17:21.109 --> 17:23.694
- Sounds silly when you say it like that.
- No, it's...

17:23.695 --> 17:26.579
it's an interesting theory,
but I think it might just be...

17:26.582 --> 17:28.832
easier to check
his last known address.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.334
Uh, 1274

17:30.336 --> 17:32.253
Hillcrest Road, Sylmar.

17:32.255 --> 17:33.800
Or you could do that.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.398
Thank you, guys.
Mm-hmm.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.268
If I robbed a bank,
I'd totally be the cowboy.

17:39.270 --> 17:40.815
You?

17:40.817 --> 17:43.367
Well, I...
wouldn't rob a bank,

17:43.369 --> 17:46.397
but, clearly, you've
given this some thought.

17:58.914 --> 18:00.109
Federal agents!

18:17.379 --> 18:19.690
All clear.

18:19.692 --> 18:21.508
Looks like they
were executed.

18:21.510 --> 18:22.465
Is that everyone?

18:22.467 --> 18:23.948
Everyone but Duncan Welch,

18:23.950 --> 18:25.495
the guy we're
looking for.

18:25.497 --> 18:26.978
He was here.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.298
Nell and Eric
confirmed the I.D.s

18:43.300 --> 18:44.683
of the heist crew.

18:44.685 --> 18:46.417
We have Patrick Rodgers,

18:46.419 --> 18:49.387
Derrick Stovall,
and Marcus Terry.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.106
Duncan Welch took the gold,
killed his buddies.

18:51.108 --> 18:52.357
It's easier

18:52.359 --> 18:55.193
to divide by one than by four.
Five.

18:55.195 --> 18:57.101
Still need to find Duncan
and the cargo van driver.

18:57.126 --> 18:57.947
Okay.

18:57.948 --> 18:59.264
I'll put out a BOLO:

18:59.266 --> 19:01.866
male, six feet tall,
dark hair...

19:01.868 --> 19:03.819
covering his entire body,

19:03.821 --> 19:05.487
partial to bananas...

19:05.489 --> 19:07.155
Duncan's partner
in the double cross?

19:07.157 --> 19:08.790
Well, unless there's another
Dumpster out there

19:08.792 --> 19:10.158
with a dead monkey in it.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.451
Gorilla.

19:11.453 --> 19:13.591
Apparently monkeys have tails.

19:13.593 --> 19:16.625
Okay. Well, according
to his bank records,

19:16.627 --> 19:19.046
Duncan Welch was spending a lot
of money before the heist.

19:19.048 --> 19:20.406
Confident man.

19:20.408 --> 19:23.042
Either that or someone was
bankrolling the heist.

19:23.044 --> 19:25.050
Someone who's willing to piss
off the Treasury Department

19:25.052 --> 19:27.353
and the Chinese government.
What was he buying?

19:27.355 --> 19:29.477
Um, that's where it
gets interesting.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.333
Check this out.

19:31.335 --> 19:33.540
Lots of dinners,
jewelry,

19:33.542 --> 19:34.833
women's lingerie.

19:34.835 --> 19:36.690
Sounds like Duncan's
got a girlfriend.

19:36.692 --> 19:38.764
Or a cross-dressing fetish.

19:39.561 --> 19:41.798
Hey, we know he likes
to dress up.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.539
You got his phone records?

19:43.541 --> 19:44.733
Yes, I do.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.264
Hello, Gloria Bryant.

19:48.266 --> 19:49.907
Could be a business associate.

19:49.909 --> 19:51.698
From 9:00 a.m.
to 7:00 p.m., maybe.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.515
But from midnight to 3:00 a.m.--

19:53.517 --> 19:55.064
that's a booty call.

19:57.168 --> 19:59.017
Well, you know,
when two people call each other

19:59.019 --> 20:00.750
in the middle of the night
and they're lonely

20:00.752 --> 20:02.383
and they want to...

20:02.386 --> 20:03.779
Is that what that's called?

20:03.781 --> 20:05.581
I'm gonna shut up now.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.515
Have an address, I got this.

20:07.517 --> 20:09.534
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna go.

20:09.536 --> 20:11.419
Ms. Blye?

20:11.421 --> 20:13.203
Let me guess: more quality time?

20:13.205 --> 20:15.929
No, I was gonna say
be safe, but...

20:15.931 --> 20:17.948
I can join you if you like.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.009
No, no.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.523
I'm good.

20:20.525 --> 20:22.693
I'm out.

20:31.949 --> 20:33.127
Gloria Bryant?

20:33.129 --> 20:34.254
Federal agent.

20:34.256 --> 20:35.836
Um...

20:35.838 --> 20:37.014
It's okay.

20:37.016 --> 20:38.874
I'm looking for Duncan Welch.

20:38.876 --> 20:40.037
Oh, uh...

20:40.039 --> 20:41.499
I haven't seen him.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.189
Which, unfortunately,
is par for the course.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.182
He just disappears

20:46.184 --> 20:47.959
without a word
and then...

20:47.961 --> 20:50.253
pops back up
like nothing's wrong.

20:50.255 --> 20:52.710
Men.
Yeah, right?

20:52.712 --> 20:54.654
I mean, I just figured
he was seeing somebody else.

20:54.656 --> 20:57.112
Never thought it was
something illegal.

20:57.114 --> 20:58.923
Gran Gran loved him.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.467
Is that your grandmother?

21:00.469 --> 21:02.760
Uh, yeah.
He'd sit with her sometimes

21:02.762 --> 21:04.288
during her game shows.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.912
Aw. Do you know
where I can find him?

21:07.777 --> 21:09.994
No.

21:09.996 --> 21:12.414
Although I might know
somebody who might.

21:12.416 --> 21:15.033
He used to go fishing
with his buddy, Oki.

21:15.035 --> 21:16.534
Lives in Ojai.

21:16.537 --> 21:18.420
I might have, like,
a birthday card or something

21:18.422 --> 21:19.788
with his return address.

21:19.790 --> 21:22.624
Great.
I'll go get it.

21:22.626 --> 21:24.793
Thanks.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.586
Gran Gran would be
so disappointed right now.

21:35.588 --> 21:37.138
Where's Duncan?

21:37.140 --> 21:38.556
I don't know.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.925
And yet you ran.

21:42.278 --> 21:44.478
Do you recognize
any of these men?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.648
Oh, my God.

21:48.434 --> 21:50.595
No.
No?

21:50.597 --> 21:52.318
Well, I'll give you a hint.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.312
They all had two things
in common.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.558
One, they were all friends
of Duncan.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.073
Two, as you can see,
they're all dead.

21:59.076 --> 22:02.081
Now that means that either
Duncan is a murderer,

22:02.083 --> 22:04.243
or he's next on the killer's
list, do you understand that?

22:04.245 --> 22:06.017
That means he's
in serious trouble,

22:06.019 --> 22:07.570
and the only way
you can help him

22:07.572 --> 22:10.661
is if you tell me where he is.

22:33.297 --> 22:35.577
Are you going to tell me?

22:35.579 --> 22:36.928
Tell you what?

22:38.737 --> 22:42.755
Oh, you've gotten better.
I'll grant you that.

22:42.756 --> 22:45.289
I had a good teacher.

22:45.291 --> 22:49.343
You're in my house now, Owen.

22:49.345 --> 22:53.430
I hope you don't truly
believe that, Henrietta.

22:53.432 --> 22:56.504
He's not an NCIS agent.

22:56.506 --> 22:58.971
Then he really isn't
your concern, is he?

22:58.973 --> 23:01.370
So much for our detente.

23:01.372 --> 23:02.890
Are we done?

23:02.892 --> 23:05.676
He may not be NCIS,

23:05.678 --> 23:09.562
but Mr. Deeks is one of my team.

23:09.564 --> 23:12.315
If anything should
happen to him,

23:12.317 --> 23:15.473
I would take it most personally.

23:21.302 --> 23:23.891
Duncan Welch?

23:24.662 --> 23:25.611
Federal agents!

23:25.613 --> 23:27.118
Hands where we
can see them.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.724
Got a body.

23:44.867 --> 23:46.176
He bled out.

23:46.178 --> 23:48.388
Looks like hours.

23:51.210 --> 23:52.485
Guys?

23:58.698 --> 24:01.482
Apparently this is
the end of the rainbow.

24:01.484 --> 24:04.072
Always thought it'd be
a little more festive.

24:05.056 --> 24:06.579
<i>Well done.</i>

24:06.581 --> 24:09.200
Assistant Director
Granger called

24:09.202 --> 24:11.003
to congratulate all of you

24:11.005 --> 24:12.675
on solving the
case so quickly.

24:12.677 --> 24:15.083
There's still one
person unaccounted for.

24:15.085 --> 24:17.510
We still don't know if he was
Duncan's partner in all this

24:17.512 --> 24:19.935
or if he killed Duncan
and the others.

24:19.937 --> 24:21.607
Well, take it from me,

24:21.609 --> 24:24.589
they were more concerned
about their precious gold.

24:24.591 --> 24:27.464
Ms. Blye, with me.

24:28.528 --> 24:29.671
Something's not right.

24:29.673 --> 24:31.100
That was too easy.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.656
We're good, but we're
not that good.

24:32.658 --> 24:34.689
Whoever killed Duncan
left him with the gold.

24:34.691 --> 24:36.150
Why?

24:36.152 --> 24:37.421
He was at death's door.

24:37.423 --> 24:38.930
The shooter could have casually
hauled away the gold.

24:38.932 --> 24:40.359
Why not take it?

24:40.361 --> 24:41.359
We could've spooked him.

24:41.361 --> 24:43.741
Got there before
they had a chance.

24:43.743 --> 24:46.822
Or maybe they
wanted us to find it.

24:57.591 --> 24:59.066
Tungsten.

25:01.005 --> 25:02.673
It's bogus.

25:16.614 --> 25:19.552
Tungsten: It's the 74th element
on the periodic table.

25:19.554 --> 25:22.727
Its name derives from
the Swedish <i>tung sten,</i>

25:22.729 --> 25:24.745
meaning "heavy stone."

25:24.746 --> 25:26.761
Uh, its chemical
symbol is a "W"

25:26.763 --> 25:29.461
because it was formerly
known as wolfram.

25:29.463 --> 25:31.843
AKA my favorite element.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.911
Nell's is ununoctium.

25:34.913 --> 25:36.388
Don't.

25:36.390 --> 25:37.564
Ah...

25:37.566 --> 25:39.242
young geek love.

25:39.244 --> 25:40.870
But I digress.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.046
Tungsten and gold are

25:42.048 --> 25:43.557
similar in weight, making it

25:43.558 --> 25:45.571
the perfect
counterfeit substance.

25:45.573 --> 25:47.754
Well, who would want
to steal fake gold?

25:47.756 --> 25:49.231
Maybe they didn't know,

25:49.233 --> 25:50.910
or maybe it wasn't fake.

25:50.912 --> 25:52.622
Whoever stole it
pulled a switch.

25:52.624 --> 25:54.050
Okay, well, then
where's the real gold?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.114
Comes back to the
cargo van driver.

25:56.116 --> 25:57.743
If they melted the real gold

25:57.745 --> 25:59.387
to coat more bars of tungsten...

25:59.389 --> 26:01.772
You could duplicate the gold
bars several times over.

26:01.774 --> 26:04.374
Turning millions into billions
before anyone got caught.

26:04.376 --> 26:07.396
Why didn't I think of that?

26:08.421 --> 26:10.585
Um, so I could
solve the case.

26:10.587 --> 26:12.096
I'm not a thief.

26:12.098 --> 26:14.497
Is there something we should
know about you, Eric?

26:15.591 --> 26:17.469
Uh, what do you,
what do you got for us, Nell?

26:17.471 --> 26:19.354
Anyway...

26:19.356 --> 26:21.106
tungsten is about
50 bucks a kilo

26:21.108 --> 26:22.773
and the gold bars
are 12.4 kilos each,

26:22.775 --> 26:25.359
so we're talking about
a loof weight.

26:25.361 --> 26:27.196
Eric, we're gonna need to know
who's been buying tungsten.

26:27.198 --> 26:29.648
And we're gonna need somewhere
where we can smelt it.

26:31.068 --> 26:32.618
I'm sorry, it's just...

26:32.620 --> 26:33.701
it's just, like,
one of those words.

26:33.703 --> 26:34.786
I can't explain it.

26:34.788 --> 26:38.790
Well, I will investigate
the smelting operation.

26:38.792 --> 26:40.742
Smelting.

26:40.743 --> 26:42.744
I'm sorry.

26:42.746 --> 26:44.880
I'm sorry,
I just can't explain it.

26:46.299 --> 26:49.774
Mr. Callen? A word.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.541
<i>You know there's</i>
<i>more going on here</i>

26:52.543 --> 26:54.245
than catching a thief.

26:54.247 --> 26:57.177
You mean how this could
affect our economy?

26:57.179 --> 26:58.666
If it were to get out

26:58.668 --> 27:02.938
that America's gold
reserves were compromised,

27:02.940 --> 27:06.647
it would wreak havoc
on our banking system.

27:06.649 --> 27:10.306
I'm wondering if that's
been the plan all along.

27:10.308 --> 27:13.237
If it is, we're not looking
for a heist crew.

27:13.239 --> 27:15.886
This could be an economic
terrorist attack.

27:15.888 --> 27:18.121
How's the world gonna react

27:18.123 --> 27:21.564
if we try to pay off a debt
to China using fake gold?

27:21.566 --> 27:23.107
Not very well indeed.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.867
So who benefits
from sowing discontent

27:24.869 --> 27:27.298
between two superpowers?

27:27.300 --> 27:28.773
Exactly.

27:28.775 --> 27:32.830
Who and why is just as
important as finding the gold.

27:32.832 --> 27:36.467
The country's already facing
a fiscal challenge.

27:36.469 --> 27:40.121
If this were to get out,

27:40.123 --> 27:44.563
it could destroy the economy
once and for all.

27:50.431 --> 27:52.660
Wolfram, you get any hits
on the tungsten?

27:52.662 --> 27:54.084
Too many to count.

27:54.086 --> 27:55.626
I'm trying to
narrow it down.

27:55.628 --> 27:57.186
What about the smelting?

27:58.445 --> 28:00.655
Smelting.

28:00.657 --> 28:03.254
How is it that you find
"smelting" to be so funny

28:03.256 --> 28:06.086
and "frelting" to be
absolutely horrifying?

28:07.999 --> 28:10.093
Did you find anything?

28:10.094 --> 28:11.433
No, uh, not on the furnace,

28:11.435 --> 28:14.686
but have you heard of
the Reptile Super Show?

28:14.688 --> 28:17.048
Yeah.
It's in Pomona next month.

28:17.051 --> 28:18.373
It's, like, world's largest.

28:18.375 --> 28:20.258
I'm sorry,
you know this how?

28:20.260 --> 28:21.226
Yeah, I went with my ex...

28:21.228 --> 28:23.011
With my friend.

28:23.013 --> 28:25.880
Oh. Interesting.

28:25.882 --> 28:29.484
So, what, is it like a dog show?

28:29.486 --> 28:32.854
Do they dress their lizards up
in little outfits

28:32.856 --> 28:34.824
and parade 'em around a ring?

28:34.826 --> 28:38.610
No, and there's no outfits
in dog shows either.

28:38.612 --> 28:40.947
We only do that to children.

28:40.948 --> 28:42.414
Great.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.533
Well, short of being
a herpetologist,

28:44.535 --> 28:46.836
I never understood
the allure of owning a snake.

28:46.838 --> 28:48.788
You don't like pets?

28:48.790 --> 28:51.207
I mean, shouldn't a pet
be something you can,

28:51.209 --> 28:52.458
I don't know, pet?

28:52.460 --> 28:53.459
Hence the name.

28:53.461 --> 28:54.910
You can pet a snake.

28:56.045 --> 28:58.130
Can if you wanted to.

28:58.132 --> 29:00.132
Do snakes like being petted?

29:02.001 --> 29:05.420
This just took a really
weird turn, didn't it?

29:05.422 --> 29:07.055
Yeah.

29:07.057 --> 29:10.258
I'm think I'm gonna go
catch up with the guys.

29:10.260 --> 29:12.694
But maybe we should run
a multivariable search

29:12.696 --> 29:14.112
where you cross-reference
the tungsten

29:14.114 --> 29:15.530
with the smelting
facilities?

29:16.899 --> 29:18.450
Sorry.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.369
Yeah.

29:26.993 --> 29:29.077
Agent Blye, how did it go
with Gloria Bryant?

29:29.079 --> 29:30.612
She tried to give me the slip,

29:30.614 --> 29:32.798
"tried" being the
operative word,

29:32.800 --> 29:34.249
but you're the
Assistant Director.

29:34.251 --> 29:36.368
I'm sure you've
been briefed, sir.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.587
Touché. Any new leads?

29:38.589 --> 29:40.956
Yes. There are some details
that need to be run down.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.123
Hopefully, they'll pan out.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.341
All right, good job.

29:43.343 --> 29:46.344
Keep me posted.

29:46.346 --> 29:49.064
Oh, uh, I hope I get
that gold star

29:49.066 --> 29:50.433
in my performance review, sir.

29:50.435 --> 29:52.734
P-Rs are below my pay grade.

29:52.736 --> 29:54.152
Oh. But before, you said that...

29:54.154 --> 29:55.687
Disregard that.

29:55.690 --> 29:58.523
Okay, then what was all that

29:58.525 --> 30:02.111
ride-along, quality-time
stuff all about?

30:02.113 --> 30:03.445
Just keeping you on your toes.

30:03.447 --> 30:05.697
Think of it more as
an evaluation.

30:05.699 --> 30:07.607
For...?

30:07.609 --> 30:09.767
I'm an ambitious man,
Agent Blye,

30:09.769 --> 30:11.975
who won't be
Assistant Director forever,

30:11.977 --> 30:15.247
and you need to think
about the future.

30:17.407 --> 30:19.698
You never know.

30:22.439 --> 30:24.796
Good luck with the case.

30:28.882 --> 30:30.875
<i>I just had the strangest</i>
<i>encounter with Granger.</i>

30:30.877 --> 30:33.432
Everything about Granger is
strange, if you ask me.

30:33.434 --> 30:34.512
What do you have?

30:34.514 --> 30:36.587
Um, a cargo van was stolen

30:36.589 --> 30:38.747
from a rental lot in
Toluca Lake last month.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.021
Surprise, surprise.

30:41.023 --> 30:42.483
Hey, Sam, do you still
want me looking

30:42.485 --> 30:43.778
for reptile supplies?

30:43.780 --> 30:45.439
No.
Okay.

30:45.441 --> 30:46.469
Where are we?

30:46.471 --> 30:47.930
Nowhere.

30:47.932 --> 30:49.491
Come on, guys,
we're missing something.

30:49.493 --> 30:52.294
Everyone leaves a trail
everywhere they go

30:52.296 --> 30:53.763
whether they know it or not.

30:53.765 --> 30:55.848
We know they have a cargo van,

30:55.850 --> 30:59.552
guns, ammo...

30:59.554 --> 31:00.970
Costumes.

31:00.972 --> 31:03.389
They paid for parking,
paid for gas.

31:03.391 --> 31:04.840
They could have stopped
for Starbucks.

31:04.842 --> 31:07.609
Somebody has to have
left a clue somewhere.

31:09.196 --> 31:11.397
Tungsten.

31:11.399 --> 31:13.015
Who needs it?
What's it used for?

31:13.017 --> 31:14.399
Everything,

31:14.401 --> 31:17.152
from electronics to
chemical catalysts.

31:17.154 --> 31:18.537
That's part of the problem.

31:18.539 --> 31:20.540
We need to focus on anomalies.

31:20.542 --> 31:21.907
Cross-reference
everything we have

31:21.909 --> 31:23.709
on Duncan, his crew, the heist,

31:23.711 --> 31:25.244
and find the guy behind
the gorilla mask.

31:25.246 --> 31:27.028
He's the key.

31:27.030 --> 31:29.082
But what if they've already
moved the gold out of L.A.?

31:31.502 --> 31:33.168
Hey, guys.

31:34.204 --> 31:35.370
Found something.

31:35.372 --> 31:37.282
A company called
Carlisle Industries purchased

31:37.284 --> 31:41.989
a tilting smelting
furnace for $37,000.

31:41.991 --> 31:44.072
That's one expensive
turkey fryer.

31:44.074 --> 31:46.419
According to this, Carlisle
Industries manufactures

31:46.420 --> 31:48.578
custom tungsten
alloy crankshafts

31:48.580 --> 31:50.568
for the after-market
auto industry.

31:50.569 --> 31:52.354
So it could be
a legitimate purchase.

31:52.356 --> 31:53.877
Possible, but unlikely.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.238
Carlisle Industries didn't
exist a month ago.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.590
And here's the clincher:

31:57.592 --> 32:00.044
Last week, Carlisle
Industries received

32:00.046 --> 32:02.532
a half-ton shipment of tungsten.

32:02.534 --> 32:04.427
There's our anomaly.

32:26.815 --> 32:28.274
What are we thinking, Kens?

32:29.100 --> 32:30.914
1,700 degrees.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.238
They're cooking something.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.477
You ready?

32:33.479 --> 32:34.953
Yup.

32:34.955 --> 32:37.193
Okay, we are up and running.

32:40.097 --> 32:42.048
Where's she hiding
the camera?

32:42.050 --> 32:44.932
Somewhere she's sure to have
his full attention.

32:44.934 --> 32:47.428
You know I can hear you, right?

32:51.076 --> 32:52.943
Hi.

32:52.945 --> 32:54.861
Can I, uh...

32:54.863 --> 32:56.219
help you?

32:56.221 --> 32:59.021
Yes, I am Wendy
with the IPA.

33:00.283 --> 33:03.666
Industrial Park Association.

33:03.668 --> 33:06.370
Our records show that
Carlisle Industries is overdue

33:06.372 --> 33:08.162
for an OSHA safety inspection.

33:08.164 --> 33:11.129
Yeah. Okay, uh...

33:11.131 --> 33:14.083
The thing is, my boss,
he isn't here right now.

33:14.085 --> 33:16.869
Can you, um,
leave a card

33:16.871 --> 33:18.644
or a number and...

33:18.646 --> 33:21.016
I'll make sure he calls you back
to set up an appointment.

33:21.018 --> 33:23.539
Nothing says welcome like having
a 300-pound Neanderthal

33:23.541 --> 33:24.997
crammed behind a desk.

33:24.999 --> 33:27.768
First impressions are important.

33:27.770 --> 33:30.206
I'm sorry, Mr.--?
Remo.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.744
Right. This is why
I'm here now, Mr. Remo.

33:32.746 --> 33:34.353
This is my appointment.

33:34.355 --> 33:35.681
Well, you're gonna
have to reschedule,

33:35.683 --> 33:37.139
'cause I'm about to lock up.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.434
Why don't you call your boss?

33:38.436 --> 33:40.292
I don't know where he is.

33:40.294 --> 33:41.536
Well, then find him.

33:41.538 --> 33:43.211
Look... honey...

33:43.213 --> 33:44.654
Shouldn't have said that.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.147
Big mistake.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.137
Excuse me?

33:48.139 --> 33:49.589
My boss isn't here.

33:49.591 --> 33:52.926
I'm about to lock up,
and you're leaving now.

33:53.895 --> 33:56.012
I'm gonna put this in my report.

33:56.014 --> 33:57.180
Oh, you do that.

33:57.182 --> 33:58.399
Eric.

33:58.401 --> 33:59.849
Looks like Kensi
could use a little help.

33:59.851 --> 34:02.519
We're on it.
Colossus, line one

34:02.521 --> 34:05.071
and a two and a three...

34:20.254 --> 34:22.589
Sorry about that, "honey."

34:25.010 --> 34:27.877
All right.

35:47.091 --> 35:48.458
I'll check that way.

36:09.696 --> 36:11.731
Shh.

37:10.673 --> 37:12.542
I had him.

37:12.544 --> 37:14.260
Course you did.

37:14.262 --> 37:16.127
Obviously.

37:16.964 --> 37:19.164
Whatever.

37:30.176 --> 37:33.778
Forget armed robbery, assault,
economic terrorism,

37:33.780 --> 37:36.649
and several prison lifetimes'
worth of lesser charges--

37:36.651 --> 37:38.868
we got seven counts
of murder, gentlemen.

37:38.870 --> 37:40.220
Seven.

37:40.222 --> 37:42.113
But only one envelope.

37:42.115 --> 37:44.428
In case you didn't already
know it, that gold you stole

37:44.430 --> 37:46.085
was essentially the
vig Uncle Sam owes

37:46.087 --> 37:47.809
on a loan to
the Chinese.

37:47.811 --> 37:49.212
Why don't you tell them
what they won, Sam?

37:49.214 --> 37:50.616
Well, in the interest

37:50.618 --> 37:52.813
of international cooperation
and full disclosure,

37:52.815 --> 37:55.940
we've agreed to send one
of you lucky contestants

37:55.942 --> 37:58.137
back to Shanghai
for questioning.

37:58.139 --> 37:59.185
That's right,
an all-expense-paid trip

37:59.187 --> 38:00.587
to the land of Ping-Pong, panda,

38:00.589 --> 38:01.974
and human rights violations.

38:01.976 --> 38:04.920
But... only one
of you gentlemen can go.

38:04.922 --> 38:06.525
So talk amongst yourselves,

38:06.527 --> 38:08.346
and in 1,200 words or less,

38:08.348 --> 38:09.886
tell us who is most deserving

38:09.888 --> 38:11.937
to go and why.

38:11.939 --> 38:14.222
Good luck, gentlemen.

38:21.060 --> 38:23.242
How long do you think
before they rat each other out?

38:23.244 --> 38:26.271
Man, as long as it takes
for Panda Express.

38:28.672 --> 38:30.144
What was in the envelope?

38:30.146 --> 38:32.477
Lakers tickets.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.414
<i>My</i> Lakers tickets?

38:39.083 --> 38:40.621
Come in.

38:40.623 --> 38:41.828
Hey.

38:41.830 --> 38:43.021
Hi.

38:43.023 --> 38:44.394
Your family gone?

38:44.396 --> 38:46.298
Yeah, Tracy had
to take the kids home.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.870
It was past their bedtime.

38:47.872 --> 38:49.890
So, you starting to remember?

38:49.892 --> 38:52.124
Yeah, and doctors say I should
get more and more each day.

38:52.126 --> 38:53.430
That's great.

38:53.432 --> 38:54.751
I still don't remember
getting married

38:54.753 --> 38:56.240
or my kids being born but...

38:56.242 --> 38:58.231
But you will.

38:58.233 --> 39:00.038
I hope so.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.995
On the other hand,
I wish

39:01.997 --> 39:03.968
I could forget
what happened today.

39:03.970 --> 39:07.901
I had two tours in Afghanistan
and I never shot anybody before.

39:07.903 --> 39:10.443
You got to take the good
with the bad.

39:10.445 --> 39:12.784
It was self-defense.

39:12.787 --> 39:16.214
Anyway, I just wanted
to check in

39:16.216 --> 39:18.474
and let you know
that we caught the guys,

39:18.476 --> 39:20.281
thanks in part to what you did.

39:20.283 --> 39:21.652
Appreciate it.

39:22.490 --> 39:23.743
Get some rest.

39:23.745 --> 39:24.830
I will.

39:24.832 --> 39:26.336
Thanks, Agent...

39:26.338 --> 39:28.544
Um... I-I'm sorry.

39:28.546 --> 39:29.862
Blye.

39:29.864 --> 39:32.297
I know. I was just messin'
with you.

39:32.299 --> 39:35.935
Bullet missed
your funny bone obviously.

39:35.937 --> 39:38.138
Take care.

39:42.611 --> 39:44.744
Guys, facial rec got a hit

39:44.746 --> 39:47.530
on the man
behind the gorilla mask.

39:47.532 --> 39:50.199
Jahveed Abbasi,
Iranian Nationalist.

39:50.201 --> 39:52.085
Countless bombings

39:52.087 --> 39:54.920
in Israel, Europe, Iraq.

39:54.922 --> 39:56.872
Does not play well with others.

39:56.874 --> 39:58.724
It sounds like this wasn't
just a heist

39:58.726 --> 40:00.293
but a state-sanctioned
terrorist attack

40:00.295 --> 40:01.712
on our financial infrastructure.

40:01.714 --> 40:04.013
Either way, we stopped it.

40:04.015 --> 40:05.131
This time.

40:05.133 --> 40:06.115
Good work, guys.

40:06.117 --> 40:08.551
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

40:08.553 --> 40:10.669
Uh, you...

40:10.671 --> 40:12.388
you two leaving?

40:13.274 --> 40:14.940
Yeah.

40:14.942 --> 40:16.275
Together?

40:16.277 --> 40:18.527
Uh, I don't know.

40:18.529 --> 40:20.680
Are we?

40:20.682 --> 40:23.616
I mean, we're going home
simultaneously.

40:23.618 --> 40:26.235
Roughly the same
direction, so...

40:26.237 --> 40:28.454
That wasn't meant to be
a skill-testing question.

40:28.456 --> 40:30.522
Ha!

40:30.524 --> 40:33.209
Nice.

40:33.211 --> 40:35.244
What was that?

40:35.246 --> 40:36.546
Don't ask, don't tell?

40:37.882 --> 40:39.548
"O accursed hunger

40:39.550 --> 40:41.133
"of gold,

40:41.135 --> 40:45.588
to what dost thou
not compel human hearts."

40:45.590 --> 40:47.006
Virgil.

40:47.008 --> 40:48.724
Too bad
those two you put

40:48.727 --> 40:51.210
in the boatshed
aren't as well versed

40:51.212 --> 40:52.812
in the classics.

40:52.814 --> 40:55.398
But they are singing
like the Vienna Boys' Choir

40:55.400 --> 40:57.417
and pointing a finger
back at Iran.

40:57.419 --> 41:00.102
Yeah, Tehran would love to see
us get into it with China.

41:00.104 --> 41:01.771
It would take the heat off them.

41:01.773 --> 41:03.690
Better luck next time.

41:03.692 --> 41:05.557
Let's hope not.

41:05.559 --> 41:07.443
And after this evening,

41:07.445 --> 41:11.231
none of us ever need
speak of this again.

41:12.333 --> 41:13.750
It's in the vault.

41:13.752 --> 41:15.951
Speak about what?

41:17.904 --> 41:20.456
"The man who can keep
a secret may be wise,

41:20.458 --> 41:22.125
"but he is not half as wise

41:22.127 --> 41:24.460
as the man who has
no secrets to keep."

41:24.462 --> 41:26.679
Edgar Watson Howe.

41:28.349 --> 41:30.082
And yet it's a necessary evil

41:30.084 --> 41:32.585
in our business, I'm afraid.

41:32.586 --> 41:35.088
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:35.090 --> 41:40.090
