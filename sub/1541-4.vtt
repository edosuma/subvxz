on "The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.437 --> 00:04.810
Damon's gone.

00:04.811 --> 00:07.267
I want you to compel me to
forget that I ever loved him.

00:07.268 --> 00:10.216
- Who is Damon Salvatore?
- He was a monster.

00:10.217 --> 00:11.514
That's my girlfriend Ivy.

00:11.516 --> 00:13.612
Somebody killed her last night
right in front of me.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.325
Caroline: Killing Enzo won't
bring her back.

00:15.326 --> 00:17.988
If I kill him, I can leave this place,
and I can start over again.

I like them to die.

00:23.761 --> 00:25.471
Vampires can't get
into Mystic Falls.

00:25.472 --> 00:26.997
They can lurk
around the borders.

00:26.998 --> 00:28.632
Jeremy: Sarah... The girl you
attacked and you compelled...

00:28.633 --> 00:30.000
No!

00:30.001 --> 00:31.734
She knows what I am.

00:31.736 --> 00:33.103
My mom lived
in Mystic Falls for years

00:33.104 --> 00:35.305
before she had me.

- Damon: Where the hell are we?
- Bonnie: 1994.

00:37.983 --> 00:40.469
My own hell.
We're never getting out.

someone else here.

Incendia.

00:45.082 --> 00:46.549
Kai: We're on the same team.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.351
Do you always try
and kill your teammates?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.445
The important thing is
that you have your magic back

00:50.446 --> 00:53.889
because your magic is the key
to getting the hell out of here.

00:58.728 --> 01:00.530
Kai: And of course,
I broke into the Oval Office

01:00.531 --> 01:03.399
and took a picture of myself at
the window looking all J.F.K.,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.469
but then I was like,
"wait. How am I gonna get

01:06.470 --> 01:07.937
these photos developed?"

01:07.938 --> 01:09.972
Damon: Oh, my God! Just
answer the damn question.

01:09.973 --> 01:12.240
How are we gonna get
out of this twilight zone?

01:12.242 --> 01:14.043
I got a question for you first.

01:14.044 --> 01:16.279
Why do you think we're
stuck on a repeating loop

01:16.280 --> 01:18.147
of May 10, 1994,

01:18.148 --> 01:21.684
doomed to relive a solar eclipse
forever and ever and ever?

01:21.685 --> 01:23.653
How the hell should I know?

01:23.654 --> 01:25.254
Well, I heard you tell Bonnie this
place was your own personal hell.

01:25.255 --> 01:26.689
I'm kind of curious why.

01:26.690 --> 01:28.090
Bonnie: I found everything
you asked for...

01:28.091 --> 01:30.693
Can opener, shower drain,
grinding wheel, jam,

01:30.694 --> 01:34.630
pocket knife, volume "O"
of the encyclopedia,

01:34.631 --> 01:39.068
a nail, and a black marker.

01:39.069 --> 01:40.403
Now what?

01:40.404 --> 01:43.139
Can't show you
with my hands taped.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.640
Bonnie.

01:44.641 --> 01:45.907
Thank you.

01:47.810 --> 01:52.220
Ok. Fine. How's this pile of crap
gonna get us out of here?

01:52.221 --> 01:53.616
I'll explain as soon
as you tell me

01:53.617 --> 01:55.951
what you did on may 10, 1994?

01:55.952 --> 01:57.887
What difference does it make?

01:57.888 --> 01:59.555
Put it this way.
Bonnie's magic is one part

01:59.556 --> 02:00.890
of the equation.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.359
My as yet undisclosed
knowledge is the other,

02:03.360 --> 02:06.762
which means you would be
hitching a ride home for free.

02:06.763 --> 02:09.965
I just want to know if
you deserve to come along.

02:09.966 --> 02:11.633
Or I could just
torture you until

02:11.634 --> 02:13.369
you say something useful.

02:13.370 --> 02:14.937
If you torture me, I'll get mad,

02:14.938 --> 02:16.537
and then I won't
want to help you.

02:16.539 --> 02:19.688
What kind of person
needs to have that explained to them?

02:23.345 --> 02:25.047
Play nice.

02:25.048 --> 02:26.448
Stop trying to
impress the new guy.

02:26.449 --> 02:28.050
Why don't you just
tell him your story?

02:28.051 --> 02:29.418
Maybe because I don't
want to talk

02:29.419 --> 02:31.486
about the worst thing
I ever did, Bonnie.

02:31.487 --> 02:34.690
Ooh. Now I'm listening.

Ready for some bad news?

02:51.139 --> 02:52.998
Unh. Heh.

02:54.844 --> 02:57.012
I barely seen you
in 50 years, Stefan.

02:57.013 --> 02:58.280
You could invite a brother in.

02:58.281 --> 03:01.917
- Give me one good reason why.
- Check your answering machine.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.351
I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

03:03.352 --> 03:05.020
Oh, I heard your message.

03:05.021 --> 03:07.355
I also heard you sent
Lexi some flowers

03:07.356 --> 03:10.891
17 years after you left her
to burn to death on a rooftop.

03:10.893 --> 03:12.293
Well...

03:12.295 --> 03:13.295
That's a little late,
but I see you're

03:13.296 --> 03:14.396
trying to make amends.

03:14.397 --> 03:15.864
I just want to know why.

03:15.865 --> 03:18.700
Ugh. Well, I can
tell you this, Stefan.

03:18.701 --> 03:20.668
I'm tired of tearing
up New York City.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.931
Maybe it's the partying,
maybe it's my conscience.

03:22.932 --> 03:24.617
I believe that would
require one.

03:24.618 --> 03:26.074
And then I had
this moment of clarity,

03:26.075 --> 03:27.442
and I said,
"wouldn't it be great

03:27.443 --> 03:30.912
if I just woke up in my own bed
and could have a fresh start?"

03:30.913 --> 03:33.148
You must be Damon.

03:33.149 --> 03:35.817
Damon, this is, uh,
Zach Salvatore.

03:35.818 --> 03:37.485
He owns the house now.
He knows the family history,

03:37.486 --> 03:39.787
and I told him if you
got out of line

03:39.788 --> 03:41.275
I'd take care of you myself.

03:41.276 --> 03:43.982
Why are you always expecting
the worst out of me, Stefan?

03:43.983 --> 03:46.568
Oh, I don't.
Otherwise, I wouldn't allow this.

03:47.463 --> 03:49.096
Come on in, Damon.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.699
Thanks.

- Hell, yeah.

of our runaway girl?

Nope. Caroline and I
combed the border

04:09.918 --> 04:13.674

No sign of Sarah.

04:13.675 --> 04:14.989
She's not any of the roads,

04:14.990 --> 04:17.491
which means she's probably
in Mystic Falls.

04:17.492 --> 04:18.988
This is bad, Stefan.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.196
Her compulsion went away
as soon as she crossed the border.

04:22.197 --> 04:24.467
She knows that Caroline
and I are vampires.

04:24.468 --> 04:27.834

I'll, uh, talk to you later.

04:36.314 --> 04:38.412

your home, Stefan.

04:38.413 --> 04:41.348
It's an escape, a hiding place.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.539
This is your home.

throw in the towel

fake new life?

not-so-fake girlfriend Ivy,

you until you come home,

09:32.805 --> 09:35.139
Damon: Perfect.
Our savior's insane

09:35.140 --> 09:36.641
and narcoleptic.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.343
No, no, no.
I'm awake.

09:39.344 --> 09:42.313
Let me guess...
You killed the pregnant woman.

09:42.314 --> 09:43.813
Shut up, Kai.
You weren't listening.

09:43.815 --> 09:45.750
I was listening in my sleep.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.085
You were hanging out with
your distant nephew Zach,

09:48.086 --> 09:51.968
who you called Uncle Zach
because that's not confusing.

09:51.969 --> 09:53.991
Plus pregnant lady Gail,

09:53.992 --> 09:56.627
who had a big
bull's-eye on her chest.

09:56.628 --> 09:58.062
Got it.

09:58.063 --> 09:59.764
Tell me you didn't kill
a pregnant woman.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.866
Oh, that's totally
what happened.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.325
Why else would today
be his personal hell?

10:05.930 --> 10:09.507
Oh, here we go.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.108
The only reason that
you're alive right now

10:11.109 --> 10:12.676
is because I thought you
could get us out of here

10:12.677 --> 10:15.845
and you could help us,
but you don't have any answers.

10:15.847 --> 10:18.648
You're just a man-child
with jam on your fingers!

10:18.650 --> 10:20.517
Ok then.

10:20.518 --> 10:24.021
To get home, we'll harness
the power of the eclipse

10:24.022 --> 10:25.856
using a mystical relic.

10:25.857 --> 10:29.436
It's called an ascendant,
and it looks like this, Damon.

10:30.361 --> 10:34.164
The last time we had it was
in the Pacific Northwest.

10:34.165 --> 10:35.666
Oregon.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.135
- We?
- It belonged to my family.

10:38.136 --> 10:40.607
So here's a little blood
to get you started.

10:41.573 --> 10:44.575
Now all we need
is a locator spell

10:44.576 --> 10:47.678
to pinpoint its whereabouts.

10:47.679 --> 10:51.014
Think you can find our
ticket out here, Bon Bon?

10:51.015 --> 10:52.715
Hell, yeah.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.642
- She's cute.
- Was cute.

11:01.246 --> 11:02.480
I'm sorry.

11:02.481 --> 11:05.650
Me, too, but what's
done is done.

11:05.651 --> 11:08.853
So after taxes
and social security

11:08.854 --> 11:12.640
and health insurance,
I'm left with $206.03

11:12.641 --> 11:14.045
to spend for the week.

11:15.827 --> 11:18.818
- You want to get drunk?
- Stefan, health insurance?

11:18.819 --> 11:21.675
Yeah. The point is
to start over,

11:21.676 --> 11:24.217
pretend to be as human
as possible.

11:24.669 --> 11:27.106
Oh, ok. So no
vampire privileges,

11:27.107 --> 11:31.208
no baggage, nothing from
our old lives whatsoever, huh?

11:31.209 --> 11:32.846
Ahem. What's this?

11:33.811 --> 11:34.878
You got me there.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.048
See, Damon isn't around
to call it a granny mobile, so...

11:38.049 --> 11:40.150
Yeah. Your brother
really did love

11:40.151 --> 11:42.386
to torture people with nicknames

11:42.387 --> 11:45.389
and just plain torture people.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.525
That's one way to put it.

11:50.128 --> 11:52.162
So your system
for moving on requires

11:52.163 --> 11:54.731
both burning bridges
and a dead-end job.

11:54.732 --> 11:56.567
We haven't even gotten
to the fun part.

11:56.568 --> 11:57.633
Paying utilities?

11:57.635 --> 12:01.004
No. Deciding who you want to be
for the next 30 years.

12:01.005 --> 12:02.172
Do you want to be an astronaut,

12:02.173 --> 12:03.540
you want to be
an olympic athlete,

12:03.541 --> 12:06.043
you want to skip med school,

12:06.044 --> 12:07.110
boom, you're a doctor.

12:07.111 --> 12:08.478
Go ahead. Challenge me.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.746
I'll show you how it's done.

12:09.747 --> 12:11.415
All right. Let's see
what you got.

12:11.416 --> 12:12.882
Ok.

12:15.185 --> 12:17.821
Quite a boozer that kid.
Put him on a saline drip.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.523
He's lucky I didn't
pump his stomach.

12:19.524 --> 12:21.725
Yeah. You know,
he's had a rough couple of months.

12:21.726 --> 12:23.260
Did you bring him in here
to put a band-aid on it

12:23.261 --> 12:24.861
and make some more excuses?

12:24.862 --> 12:27.064
No. I actually came
here for some advice

12:27.065 --> 12:28.565
from a professional.

12:28.566 --> 12:30.767
Well, a kick in the ass
might help.

12:30.768 --> 12:32.536
Jeremy, too.

12:32.537 --> 12:33.870
Look. If he's anything
like his sister,

12:33.871 --> 12:35.672
I'm sure he'll be fine.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.240
It's nothing I don't treat
every single night on campus

12:37.241 --> 12:39.042
or didn't do myself
when I was a student.

12:39.043 --> 12:40.644
Ok.

12:40.645 --> 12:42.112
What about you?

12:42.113 --> 12:43.780
Former party animal?

12:43.781 --> 12:45.248
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I used to get kicked out

12:45.249 --> 12:47.751
of the library
all the time, you know,

12:47.752 --> 12:49.586
because it was closing.

12:49.587 --> 12:51.500
Right. Head in the Wiccan bible?

12:58.928 --> 13:01.230
Ok. One more piece
of professional advice.

13:01.232 --> 13:04.234
When a successful, sexy,
only moderately insecure doctor

13:04.235 --> 13:06.462
is flirting with you,

13:06.463 --> 13:08.303
give her your
undivided attention.

13:12.809 --> 13:15.144
Elena: Caroline's laying
low at the dorm,

13:15.145 --> 13:17.368
no sign of Sarah yet,

13:17.369 --> 13:18.615
which means she's
either hiding out

13:18.616 --> 13:23.190
or she's planning her
nightly news exclusive to out me.

13:23.191 --> 13:25.288
Well, if she does out you,

13:25.289 --> 13:27.790
then you start your life
over somewhere else

13:27.791 --> 13:30.221
free of all the, uh,
supernatural drama.

13:30.222 --> 13:31.200
Right.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.904
So you ready to see
the system in action?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.366
- Ready.
- All right.

13:38.669 --> 13:41.131
- Hand over your ring.
- What?

13:41.132 --> 13:43.213
Your ring.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.641
Ok.

13:45.642 --> 13:48.476
[Music playing]

14:02.458 --> 14:04.627
Elena Williams...

14:04.628 --> 14:06.362
[Woman gasps]

14:06.363 --> 14:11.332
Ohh! Stefan Cooper,
what are you doing?

14:11.334 --> 14:13.969
We've known each other
for a very long time now,

14:13.970 --> 14:16.472
and you've always been
my best friend.

14:16.473 --> 14:18.774
I have always loved you,

14:18.775 --> 14:22.211
and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

14:22.212 --> 14:24.713
- Will you...
- Wait!

14:24.714 --> 14:28.410
You're not just proposing to me
because I'm pregnant, are you?

14:29.352 --> 14:31.019
No. No.

14:31.020 --> 14:34.723
I-I am proposing to you
because you are my rock, ok?

14:34.724 --> 14:36.792
You have stood by my side

14:36.793 --> 14:39.762
through the multiple
rehabs, the jail time,

14:39.763 --> 14:41.563
the bull fighting injury.

14:41.564 --> 14:44.066
I mean, you have brought
me back from the edge,

14:44.067 --> 14:46.368
and, sweetheart, this baby

14:46.369 --> 14:49.541
is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

14:51.007 --> 14:52.544
Will you marry me?

14:54.010 --> 14:55.277
Yes!

14:55.278 --> 14:57.778
[Applause]

15:01.450 --> 15:04.486
Ha! Oh!

15:04.487 --> 15:06.421
Aw. You're crazy.

15:06.422 --> 15:08.356
See that? New identities,
new lives.

15:08.357 --> 15:09.490
It's easy.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.259
Thank you all so much.
Thank you.

15:18.366 --> 15:22.103
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras,

15:22.104 --> 15:24.104
sequitas sanguinem.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.607
It doesn't feel right.

15:26.609 --> 15:28.910
Maybe I need a bigger map.

15:28.911 --> 15:30.211
Maybe you're just
out of practice

15:30.212 --> 15:31.780
and you suck at magic now.

15:31.781 --> 15:33.415
Kai: Ignore him, Bonnie.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.517
Pretend he's
a white noise machine.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.053
That's how I used to
tune out my siblings.

15:38.054 --> 15:42.624
I grew up with a ton of
little sisters and brothers

15:42.625 --> 15:45.089
and all of them
constantly yammering,

15:45.090 --> 15:47.595
but it, uh, taught me
how to focus.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.796
Damon: Easy there, big brother.

15:49.798 --> 15:52.733
She doesn't know you.
At least buy her a drink.

15:56.771 --> 15:59.307
- Damon: Can I call you Liz?
- Sure?

15:59.308 --> 16:02.210
Your daughter is so adorable.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.178
Yeah. Caroline's
high maintenance,

16:04.179 --> 16:06.647
but she's worth it.

16:10.118 --> 16:11.919
I am so getting rid
of that photo.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.921
Stefan,
come take a picture of Zach and me.

16:13.922 --> 16:15.021
Sure.

16:15.023 --> 16:16.423
Thanks, Stefan.

16:20.628 --> 16:22.662
And now back to my cravings.

16:26.467 --> 16:31.505
Hey. Um, what happened
to your wrist?

16:31.506 --> 16:34.075
I don't know.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.610
Liz: So how does thing
help us watch the eclipse?

16:36.611 --> 16:38.512
You put it in between you

16:38.513 --> 16:40.847
and the thing that's
too hot to look at.

16:40.849 --> 16:44.251
Ahh! It works!

16:44.252 --> 16:46.120
My husband would get
a kick out of you.

16:46.121 --> 16:48.022
We should invite you
over to dinner sometime.

16:48.023 --> 16:50.724
Stefan: Damon, what'd
you do to Gail?

16:50.725 --> 16:51.926
Is everything ok?

16:51.927 --> 16:53.894
Looks like the jig is up.

16:53.895 --> 16:55.095
Hey. Look at me.

16:55.096 --> 16:59.466
Go home. Forget you ever met us.

16:59.467 --> 17:02.102
Hey. How the hell
did you feed on Gail?

17:02.103 --> 17:04.805
- She's on vervain.
- In her coffee.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.273
I swapped it out last week,
same for Zach.

17:07.275 --> 17:08.608
These people are my friends.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.144
Zach is family.
They trust me.

17:10.145 --> 17:11.679
And they'll trust us both.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.314
Look. I'm only feeding
inside the house, right?

17:13.315 --> 17:15.582
Snatch, eat, erase.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.252
It's all completely
functional, Stefan.

17:18.252 --> 17:21.186
I told you it's a new start.

17:22.656 --> 17:24.156
[Snap]

17:30.130 --> 17:33.967
Bonnie: ...Nas ex viras,
sequitas sanguinem.

17:33.968 --> 17:37.337
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras,

17:37.338 --> 17:39.338
sequitas sanguinem.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.440
The blood's moving
towards Virginia.

17:40.441 --> 17:41.508
That can't be right.

17:41.509 --> 17:42.608
Uh-uh.
The spell's working.

17:42.610 --> 17:45.012
It's showing me Mystic Falls.

17:45.013 --> 17:46.712
It feels so...

17:49.516 --> 17:50.950
Close.

17:53.820 --> 17:56.256
It's right...

17:56.257 --> 17:58.057
Here.

18:04.297 --> 18:06.833
Very good.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.802
That's the ascendant?

18:08.803 --> 18:10.770
The one and only.

18:10.771 --> 18:12.671
Thanks for
the mind games, jackass.

18:13.037 --> 18:16.343
It was just another little test
to make sure Bonnie's magic

18:16.344 --> 18:18.750
was precise enough
for the spell.

18:19.246 --> 18:21.413
I do believe you're ready.

18:21.415 --> 18:23.450
Pack your bags.

18:23.451 --> 18:25.217
We're going home.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.418
[Damon groaning]

18:38.550 --> 18:40.064
Ohh.

18:40.065 --> 18:43.244
So here's what
I don't get, Damon.

18:43.764 --> 18:45.998
Why'd you insinuate
yourself back into my life

18:45.999 --> 18:50.669
and then cheat and lie
and break all the rules?

18:50.670 --> 18:52.973
Well, I lied because
I knew you'd be mad.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.507
Believe it or not, I
like being here, Stefan.

18:56.810 --> 18:59.144
[Sighs]

18:59.146 --> 19:02.169
Aah! Auugh!

19:03.342 --> 19:07.437
You'll get your daylight ring back
when you decide to behave.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.221
Now answer my question.

19:10.223 --> 19:13.182
- Why'd you come back here?
- Because I missed my brother.

19:13.876 --> 19:15.761
I wanted to have a connection
to my humanity, Stefan,

19:15.762 --> 19:17.467
I wanted to feel
something again,

19:17.468 --> 19:18.797
and when I decided
to come back home,

19:18.798 --> 19:21.165
it all came rushing back
just like I hoped it would.

19:21.166 --> 19:24.252
Oh, congrats.
Now what?

19:24.253 --> 19:26.779
Come on, man.
Let's just hit the road, you and me.

19:26.780 --> 19:30.542
Huh? I'll let you drive my car,
I'll get you off this vegan diet,

19:30.543 --> 19:32.778
teach you how to feed again.

19:32.779 --> 19:34.179
It'll be great, Stef.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.416
Huh?
What do you say?

19:37.417 --> 19:40.819
Come on! Trust me.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.779
Yeah. I can imagine
a road trip with you.

19:43.780 --> 19:45.255
Yeah.

19:45.256 --> 19:46.825
I can imagine you
feeding on innocent people

19:46.826 --> 19:49.795
and leaving a trail
of bodies behind.

19:49.796 --> 19:51.863
I can imagine you making
me drink human blood

19:51.864 --> 19:54.032
and laughing at me
while I suffer.

19:54.033 --> 19:56.068
Way to be an optimist, Stefan.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.090
I'm just looking
at the facts, Damon.

19:58.337 --> 20:01.639
1912, you convinced me
to drink human blood again,

20:01.641 --> 20:03.457
which is why I became a ripper.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.378
1942, you almost pushed
me off the rails again

20:06.379 --> 20:07.946
because you were so damn needy.

20:07.947 --> 20:10.549
1977, you left
my best friend to die

20:10.550 --> 20:13.218
after I sent her
to come help you,

20:13.219 --> 20:15.287
and now I'm finally happy,

20:15.288 --> 20:16.588
I have a new life,
I'm doing well,

20:16.589 --> 20:18.857
and, uh, you just can't
handle that,

20:18.858 --> 20:20.191
can you, Damon?

20:20.192 --> 20:22.527
I'm not trying to screw up
your dumb new life.

20:22.528 --> 20:24.162
You don't have to try, Damon.

20:24.163 --> 20:25.830
All you have to do is exist

20:25.831 --> 20:28.166
because no matter what
I do or where I go,

20:28.167 --> 20:30.068
you will be with me forever,

20:30.069 --> 20:33.642
trying to destroy
every single thing that I built.

20:33.643 --> 20:37.842
I don't know why I thought this time
would be any different.

20:37.843 --> 20:39.626
I wanted it to be different,

20:40.279 --> 20:42.479
but you just keep failing.

20:44.716 --> 20:46.890
Guess that's a no
on the road trip, huh?

20:50.888 --> 20:54.091
That's a no on the road trip.

20:56.494 --> 20:58.730
[Music playing]

20:58.731 --> 21:01.966
So according to Caroline,
Sarah's still M.I.A.,

21:01.967 --> 21:03.768
and now Enzo's missing.

21:03.769 --> 21:06.571
Probably out killing
someone else's girlfriend.

21:06.572 --> 21:09.474
Uh, uh. Pregnant, remember?

21:09.475 --> 21:12.129
Dumbest lie I've ever told.
Can I just take that one back?

21:12.130 --> 21:14.962
No, but you'll have to
reinvent yourself in 30 years.

21:15.410 --> 21:18.381
If you don't, people will start asking
why you're not getting any older.

21:20.952 --> 21:22.787
But when I first met you,

21:22.788 --> 21:23.854
you said you'd been
away from Mystic Falls

21:23.855 --> 21:25.623
for 15 years.

21:25.624 --> 21:27.531
What made you come back
ahead of schedule?

21:28.626 --> 21:31.524
You said it yourself.
I met you.

21:31.932 --> 21:35.966
Since 1864, I have
been a carpenter,

21:35.967 --> 21:38.413
an ambulance driver,
a migrant worker,

21:38.414 --> 21:40.268
high-school student.

21:41.006 --> 21:44.286
So then why auto mechanic
for 200 bucks a week?

21:45.310 --> 21:48.078
No reason.

21:48.079 --> 21:50.781
Yeah. It must be hard,
all that change

21:50.782 --> 21:52.815
without a constant in your life.

21:55.152 --> 21:59.290
We haven't talked
about your brother.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.959
A little weird to hear
you refer to Damon

22:01.960 --> 22:05.295
as just my brother.

22:05.296 --> 22:07.865
What else would I call him?

22:07.866 --> 22:09.633
I don't even know anymore.

22:09.634 --> 22:11.434
Anymore?
What does that mean?

22:11.436 --> 22:14.004
You know what?
It's, uh, it's not important.

22:14.005 --> 22:15.387
Things change, right?

22:16.734 --> 22:19.109
To change.

22:19.110 --> 22:21.393
Who cares what
people think, right?

22:21.845 --> 22:23.679
To change.

22:25.549 --> 22:28.672
Damon: You're wandering
around like a crazy man why?

22:28.673 --> 22:31.188
I'm looking
for the exact right spot.

22:31.189 --> 22:33.490
We need to find where the power
of the eclipse is focused.

22:33.491 --> 22:36.226
You could've just shown us
the ascendant to begin with.

22:36.227 --> 22:38.395
Yeah, but I wanted to
feel your hand on my chest.

22:38.396 --> 22:40.163
There's something not
right about him.

22:40.164 --> 22:41.865
You're just not used
to guys hitting on you.

22:41.866 --> 22:43.967
You know, I can't wait
to get out of here

22:43.968 --> 22:45.802
and talk to somebody else.

22:45.803 --> 22:47.670
Can we just have a few
lasting seconds of peace

22:47.672 --> 22:49.239
while this idiot uses that thing

22:49.240 --> 22:52.374
to get the stars to align?

22:58.081 --> 23:00.749
Damon: Hey.
What's up with the nature walk?

23:00.751 --> 23:02.218
Kai: I used the ascendant
to figure out

23:02.219 --> 23:04.087
where we need to be
standing during the eclipse.

23:04.088 --> 23:05.755
Great. Let's do some magic,

23:05.756 --> 23:06.723
get the hell out of here.

23:06.724 --> 23:08.758
- Oregon.
- What?

23:08.759 --> 23:10.460
I've read this paper,
like, a thousand times.

23:10.461 --> 23:12.028
There's something
in it about Oregon.

23:12.029 --> 23:13.697
What about it?

23:13.698 --> 23:15.865
You know, Kai said he had all
those brothers and sisters?

23:15.866 --> 23:17.367
Mm-hmm.

23:17.368 --> 23:19.936
"Family massacred in Portland"?

23:19.937 --> 23:22.038
The only one missing
was the oldest boy,

23:22.039 --> 23:23.739
a 22-year-old named Malachai.

23:23.741 --> 23:26.042
Who names a kid Malachai?

23:26.043 --> 23:28.076
It's like they expected me to be evil.

23:28.078 --> 23:29.279
All these kids were murdered.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.548
Hello? Not everyone died.

23:31.549 --> 23:33.716
I had a soft spot for
one of my sisters.

23:33.717 --> 23:35.184
Otherwise,
I would have cut her lungs out

23:35.185 --> 23:36.687
and not just her spleen.

23:36.688 --> 23:37.762
What?

23:37.763 --> 23:39.489
You can survive
without a spleen.

23:39.490 --> 23:40.623
Something tells me
you're not speaking

23:40.624 --> 23:41.798
hypothetically.

23:42.947 --> 23:47.568
Well, these two, I, uh, hung
off a stairwell railing.

23:47.569 --> 23:49.632
Then I put a hunting knife
in her abdomen,

23:49.633 --> 23:52.335
and him I drowned in the pool.

23:52.336 --> 23:53.503
He kept fighting me.

23:53.504 --> 23:54.971
I was like,

23:54.972 --> 23:58.496
"I saved you for last,
you ungrateful little"...

23:59.901 --> 24:02.211
Anyway, that was that.

24:02.212 --> 24:04.780
You just killed
your whole family?

24:04.781 --> 24:06.816
Coven to be precise.

24:06.817 --> 24:09.151
Oh, you know,
a family of witches.

24:09.152 --> 24:11.152
You've been making her jump
through hoops, and you're a witch?

24:11.154 --> 24:15.257
Sort of yeah.
No powers obviously.

24:15.258 --> 24:19.028
Oh, and of course,
Gemini coven did not

24:19.029 --> 24:21.430
take it too well when
they heard what I did in Portland.

24:21.431 --> 24:23.766
That's why they
banished me here.

24:23.767 --> 24:26.135
This place is a prison.

24:26.136 --> 24:28.337
They created it for you.

24:28.338 --> 24:33.209
Yep! This isn't
your hell, Damon.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.509
It's mine.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.267
You call this a fair fight?

24:45.269 --> 24:47.298
You're basically
an Original vampire.

24:49.472 --> 24:51.040
You've killed
an Original before.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.575
Now get your head in the game,

24:52.576 --> 24:54.576
and maybe you'll keep
it out of the bottle.

24:58.214 --> 24:59.715
Happy?

24:59.717 --> 25:02.185
I am trying to help you
pull yourself together, Jeremy.

25:02.186 --> 25:05.622
- Now what is your problem?
- My problem

25:05.623 --> 25:08.291
is that everyone thinks
that I shouldn't have one.

25:08.292 --> 25:09.759
I have the right to be
messed up right now.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.862
Bonnie is dead.
She knew it was gonna happen,

25:12.863 --> 25:14.964
and she said good-bye
over the phone

25:14.965 --> 25:17.133
just so you...

25:17.134 --> 25:20.970
Keep going. So what?
So I could come back to life, right?

25:20.971 --> 25:24.728
You, Elena, Stefan, Tyler, Enzo.

25:24.729 --> 25:27.176
She saved everybody
but herself.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.845
Listen, Jeremy. You want to
talk about resentment, huh?

25:29.847 --> 25:31.314
Is that it?

25:31.315 --> 25:33.983
My wife ran away
because she would rather be

25:33.984 --> 25:36.819
a vampire than be married to me.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.854
Come to find out,
it was Damon who turned her,

25:38.855 --> 25:40.590
and then she died,

25:40.591 --> 25:43.592
and then Jenna...
She died,

25:43.593 --> 25:44.794
and then I died,

25:44.795 --> 25:47.263
and then the guy
who killed my wife died,

25:47.264 --> 25:49.098
and I actually kind of miss him,

25:49.099 --> 25:51.500
and now I can't even
talk to a girl

25:51.501 --> 25:54.637
without fantasizing
about tearing into her neck?

25:54.638 --> 25:59.775
I mean, Jeremy, I have
resentment for years, years!

25:59.776 --> 26:02.278
I get it, ok,

26:02.279 --> 26:03.846
but I find a way to keep going

26:03.847 --> 26:05.481
because that's what we do.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.565
We find a way to keep going!

26:12.688 --> 26:14.188
Ok?

26:16.892 --> 26:18.027
[Music playing]

26:18.028 --> 26:19.794
Oh.

26:21.630 --> 26:23.632
Right.

26:23.633 --> 26:26.368
So if we were to
run into each other

26:26.369 --> 26:28.837
in some random town in 30 years,

26:28.838 --> 26:30.372
do we pretend like
we're strangers?

26:30.373 --> 26:33.142
Elena, I'm avoiding
Mystic Falls, not you.

26:33.143 --> 26:34.809
We can talk, we can visit,

26:34.811 --> 26:38.046
and if you ever need
a car repair,

26:38.047 --> 26:41.215
I will give you
the parts at cost.

26:48.156 --> 26:51.058
- Bye, Stefan.
- Bye.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.237
Hey, man.

27:07.008 --> 27:09.544
Ahh.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.180
Noticed you weren't
celebrating my engagement.

27:12.181 --> 27:14.883
How come?

27:14.884 --> 27:16.318
Hard to be happy
for the guy who put

27:16.319 --> 27:17.652
my brother in the hospital.

27:17.653 --> 27:19.588
Oh. Right, right, right. Ok.

27:19.589 --> 27:21.323
Hey. Remind me.
Which guy was it...

27:21.324 --> 27:22.958
Broken nose or fractured arm?

27:22.959 --> 27:25.560
I was kind of drunk.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.895
I'm still waiting
for the congrats

27:26.896 --> 27:29.197
on my engagement.

27:29.198 --> 27:32.734
"I'm really happy for you."

27:32.735 --> 27:34.234
Yeah.

27:36.538 --> 27:39.374
Heh heh.
That all you got?

27:39.375 --> 27:41.441
Come on, man.
Hit me. Come on.

27:53.588 --> 27:54.622
Ohh.

27:54.623 --> 27:57.392
[Coughing]

27:57.393 --> 27:59.159
You frigging enjoying this?

28:00.795 --> 28:03.297
You sick freak!

28:03.298 --> 28:04.932
Go home, clean up,

28:04.933 --> 28:07.134
and forget this ever happened.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.906
What the hell are you doing?

28:17.011 --> 28:19.247
We're not letting
Kai out of here, ok?

28:19.248 --> 28:20.615
He just said he's
a serial killer.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.717
I don't care.
I want to get out of here.

28:22.718 --> 28:24.318
How can you not care?
Maybe because of all

28:24.319 --> 28:26.120
the horrible things you've done?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.655
Maybe because killing
a bunch of kids

28:27.656 --> 28:28.956
is not a big deal
to someone who's murdered

28:28.957 --> 28:31.459
a pregnant woman?

28:31.460 --> 28:33.026
Am I wrong?

28:38.833 --> 28:42.395
- Did you leave the door open?
- No. Why?

28:43.302 --> 28:44.971
[Gail screams]

28:52.012 --> 28:54.215
This eclipse party blows.

28:54.216 --> 28:57.284
I didn't see the sun at all
when I made it across the yard.

28:57.285 --> 28:59.153
You forget how much
stronger we are

28:59.154 --> 29:01.989
when we drink human blood.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.123
Zach.

29:03.124 --> 29:06.459
- Damon, please don't hurt her.
- I want my ring back, Stefan.

29:10.497 --> 29:12.031
Attaboy.

29:12.033 --> 29:14.568
I'm never gonna be
rid of you, am I?

29:14.569 --> 29:17.471
No. No, you're not.

29:17.472 --> 29:19.506
Because in 1912 I showed you

29:19.507 --> 29:21.775
who you were, Stefan.

29:21.776 --> 29:23.443
In 1942,
I gave you your freedom,

29:23.444 --> 29:25.879
and in 1977, I almost killed

29:25.880 --> 29:27.446
your best friend because
it should have been you

29:27.448 --> 29:29.149
there to help me, Stefan.

29:29.150 --> 29:31.585
You owe me,

29:31.586 --> 29:36.022
and it'll take you an eternity
to pay me back.

29:39.159 --> 29:40.526
Zach: No!

29:44.398 --> 29:49.068
An eternity of misery, brother,
just like I promised.

29:58.431 --> 30:02.039
Ouch. Poor nephew Uncle Zach.

30:03.161 --> 30:05.635
Stefan compelled
Uncle Zach to forget

30:05.636 --> 30:07.725
about the girlfriend
and the baby,

30:07.726 --> 30:09.466
but he couldn't cover up
all those murders.

30:09.468 --> 30:10.969
The founders' council
was restarted,

30:10.970 --> 30:13.238
and Stefan took off,
left Mystic Falls

30:13.239 --> 30:15.570
for about 15 years.
We both did,

30:16.679 --> 30:17.815
and then when I saw
Uncle Zach again,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.114
I couldn't look at him
without remembering

30:19.115 --> 30:20.211
that I had ruined everything,

30:20.212 --> 30:23.225
so it was a nice relief
when I got to kill him.

30:24.081 --> 30:26.584
- Ok. Can we go back now?
- Kai: Oh, come on, Bonnie.

30:26.585 --> 30:27.885
You want to go home
to your friends,

30:27.886 --> 30:29.754
I want to go back
and give the rest

30:29.755 --> 30:32.657
of the Gemini coven
an excruciating death. Win-win.

30:32.658 --> 30:34.592
Look. I know this guy's not
a model citizen, ok, Bonnie,

30:34.593 --> 30:36.094
but I got to get back,

30:36.095 --> 30:38.744
not just for Elena
but for my brother.

30:39.364 --> 30:41.933
I'm sorry, Damon.

30:41.934 --> 30:44.676
Sorry doesn't work for me.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.305
Hey. We might be having
a bit of a disagreement,

30:47.306 --> 30:50.274
but don't ever lay
a hand on her.

30:50.275 --> 30:52.877
Kind of a nonissue now.

30:52.878 --> 30:54.478
Missed today's eclipse.

30:54.479 --> 30:57.047
- Rain check for tomorrow.
- No.

31:03.187 --> 31:06.123
So you and the sheriff
don't seem to get along.

31:06.124 --> 31:09.627
Oh. Liz and my wife
were high-school rivals,

31:09.628 --> 31:13.531
some issue about who was captain
of the field hockey team.

31:13.532 --> 31:17.101
- You're married?
- I was.

31:17.102 --> 31:20.037
Yeah. Kris died
in a car accident.

31:20.038 --> 31:21.871
I'm sorry.

31:21.873 --> 31:25.342
Well, that's why I
left Mystic Falls.

31:25.343 --> 31:28.025
Too many memories.

31:29.981 --> 31:32.149
So what'd you tell
the sheriff about Jay?

31:32.150 --> 31:35.019
Oh, just what I saw.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.388
Uh, tons of blood.

31:37.389 --> 31:39.990
Probably a mountain lion.

31:39.991 --> 31:42.871
Just another animal attack, huh?

31:43.928 --> 31:45.951
You sound doubtful.

31:47.012 --> 31:49.366
This is gonna sound weird,

31:49.367 --> 31:53.237
but last night,
Jay told me that he was

31:53.238 --> 31:55.541
tracking a vampire.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.847
I mean, that's crazy, right?

32:00.111 --> 32:02.044
I'm gonna show you something.

32:04.348 --> 32:06.550
I thought you agreed to leave.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.052
I forgot my jacket, Stefan.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.987
What happened with that guy?

32:10.988 --> 32:12.522
I told you I have a system.

32:12.523 --> 32:14.858
Letting somebody kick your
ass so that you can feel?

32:14.859 --> 32:16.259
You are the last person
who should be lecturing

32:16.260 --> 32:18.728
me on coping mechanisms.

32:18.729 --> 32:22.098
You're not alone
in your grief, Stefan.

32:22.099 --> 32:24.067
I lost Bonnie
when you lost Damon,

32:24.068 --> 32:25.669
but I fought through it.

32:25.670 --> 32:26.770
Yeah?
All by yourself?

32:26.771 --> 32:28.738
Yes.

32:28.739 --> 32:32.642
And it was hard.

32:32.643 --> 32:34.010
I know that you're
pushing me away

32:34.011 --> 32:35.678
because I never liked Damon...

32:35.680 --> 32:37.836
Believe me, that's not
what it is.

32:37.837 --> 32:39.815
And I know that he's
your brother. I get it,

32:39.816 --> 32:42.886
but why inflict
so much pain on yourself

32:42.887 --> 32:45.170
for such a hateful person?

32:45.790 --> 32:47.590
I mean, he doesn't
deserve your grief.

32:47.591 --> 32:50.693
There's got to be another
way that you can move on.

32:50.694 --> 32:53.830
I'm sorry that I can't
just forget him like you, Elena.

32:53.831 --> 32:56.299
- No one's forgetting him.
- You are.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.634
You erased him.

32:57.635 --> 32:59.068
What are you talking about?

32:59.069 --> 33:00.370
You had Alaric
compel you to forget

33:00.371 --> 33:02.405
every good thing
that Damon ever did.

33:02.406 --> 33:03.840
You made him a monster
in your own mind

33:03.841 --> 33:05.074
because you couldn't
handle the grief

33:05.075 --> 33:06.643
of losing him.

33:06.644 --> 33:08.111
I don't believe anything
that you're saying.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.279
Why would I do that?

33:09.280 --> 33:10.380
Because you were
in love with him,

33:10.381 --> 33:11.748
and he was in love with you,

33:11.749 --> 33:13.867
and when Damon died,
a part of you died, too.

33:14.651 --> 33:18.755
Wow. Oh, God.
What? No, no.

33:18.756 --> 33:22.792
Stefan, how could I
possibly love Damon?

33:22.793 --> 33:25.928
Believe me, I asked myself that
for a very long time,

33:25.929 --> 33:27.797
and then eventually, I saw it.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.465
Damon inspired you,

33:29.466 --> 33:33.069
he pushed you to own
the darkest parts of yourself,

33:33.070 --> 33:34.804
and when you died,
he was the only one

33:34.805 --> 33:36.211
that could make
you feel alive again,

33:36.212 --> 33:38.674
and you made him feel human.

33:38.675 --> 33:40.376
You love Damon
for the same reasons

33:40.377 --> 33:42.178
that I love Damon

33:42.179 --> 33:43.813
because in spite
of every single thing

33:43.814 --> 33:47.783
that he did we couldn't
live without him,

33:47.784 --> 33:50.853
and now you don't have to,
but I do,

33:50.854 --> 33:54.657
so I'm gonna do it my way.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.491
You can do it yours.

34:14.158 --> 34:17.260
- What is this place?
- A secret.

34:18.813 --> 34:23.367
A secret I only share
with people I trust.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.322
You remember the gas leak
in town over the summer?

34:28.322 --> 34:30.491
Well, I came back to make
sure my grandmother was ok.

34:30.492 --> 34:32.760
First time I've been back
in years.

34:32.761 --> 34:35.460
When I crossed
the town border...

34:37.130 --> 34:39.266
Something changed.

34:39.266 --> 34:42.036
Memories came flooding back.

34:44.010 --> 34:47.271
And I realized that my wife

34:47.965 --> 34:50.339
didn't die in a car accident.

34:51.277 --> 34:52.946
She was murdered,

34:52.947 --> 34:55.581
drained of her blood
right in front of me,

34:55.583 --> 34:58.541
and the killer made me believe

34:58.542 --> 35:00.623
I was responsible.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.618
I had to find out
what kind of monster

35:04.475 --> 35:06.892
could do all that.

35:15.331 --> 35:16.787
Vampires...

35:18.506 --> 35:21.597
They are real,
and one murdered my wife,

35:24.011 --> 35:28.665
but this is the one
who murdered Jay,

35:28.666 --> 35:31.331
and I'm gonna get him to name all
his vampire buddies,

35:31.332 --> 35:35.058
starting with the one
who bit your friend Sarah.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.543
Sarah?

35:42.544 --> 35:44.026
You try anything,

35:44.027 --> 35:47.637
and I call 911 and out
your vampire sister to the world.

35:47.638 --> 35:50.869
Hey. Just take it easy.
What do you want?

35:53.878 --> 35:58.009
Answers. I found this when I was
tossing the house last night.

35:59.152 --> 36:00.858
That's my mom,

36:01.548 --> 36:03.001
and the reason I know this is

36:03.002 --> 36:05.315
because I've had this
since I was a baby.

36:09.803 --> 36:12.360
My mom was a Jane Doe.

36:12.361 --> 36:13.993
Her body was still warm
when they dumped it

36:13.994 --> 36:16.720
at the hospital
6 months pregnant.

36:16.721 --> 36:19.514
The nurses thought
I was DOA, too,

36:19.515 --> 36:21.701
but one doctor did
an emergency c-section,

36:21.702 --> 36:23.870
and I survived.

36:23.871 --> 36:25.996
I lived 3 months
in an incubator.

36:25.997 --> 36:29.035
They didn't know who my dad was,

36:29.036 --> 36:31.610
and neither did I,
but then I found this.

36:31.612 --> 36:34.075
[Music playing]

36:40.478 --> 36:42.954
Your dad is Zach Salvatore.

36:45.678 --> 36:49.138
How could you obliterate
an entire chapter of my life?

36:49.139 --> 36:53.436
Look, Elena. As much
as I like to think

36:53.437 --> 36:55.151
that I am full of wisdom,

36:55.152 --> 36:57.169
I think it's time
we stop pretending

36:57.170 --> 37:00.295
that I actually know
what's best, ok?

37:00.296 --> 37:02.474
Look. I've got my own issues
to sort out right now,

37:02.475 --> 37:08.446
and I think this will
explain it much better than I can.

37:23.849 --> 37:26.502
"Dear me,
if you're reading this,

37:26.503 --> 37:28.066
then somebody spilled the beans

37:28.067 --> 37:30.135
about your
selective memory loss.

37:30.136 --> 37:32.471
My money's on Caroline.

37:32.472 --> 37:34.800
Yes, you loved Damon.

37:35.761 --> 37:38.568
You loved him with
a passion that consumed you,

37:40.323 --> 37:42.114
and then when Damon died,

37:42.115 --> 37:45.927
the void he filled
was too deep, too dark.

37:46.902 --> 37:48.920
Facing an eternity without
your soul mate,

37:48.921 --> 37:50.355
you went off the deep end.

37:50.356 --> 37:53.859
You turned into
someone that you weren't,

37:53.860 --> 37:56.828
a monster.

37:56.829 --> 37:58.597
Alaric can restore
your lost memories.

37:58.598 --> 38:02.662
All you have to do is ask,
but I hope that you don't.

38:03.436 --> 38:06.404
I tried it the other way.

38:06.405 --> 38:08.872
I didn't see
an end to the pain.

38:10.877 --> 38:12.877
I want you to
rediscover yourself

38:12.878 --> 38:15.576
in the absence
of the one who defined you.

38:15.577 --> 38:17.817
If you feel any hope
for the future at all,

38:17.818 --> 38:20.350
then you're already better off.

38:23.403 --> 38:27.131
You've been given
a chance to start over.

38:28.070 --> 38:30.929
I want you to take it.

38:30.930 --> 38:33.565
I want you to be happy."

38:33.566 --> 38:36.733
So what do you want me to do?

38:49.647 --> 38:51.883
Can you hold on to that,

38:51.884 --> 38:55.089
keep it safe in case I
ever need to read it again?

39:02.522 --> 39:04.262
Shame eating?

39:04.263 --> 39:06.304
Thinking about that
pregnant lady.

39:06.753 --> 39:08.748
She had a thing for pancakes.

39:09.768 --> 39:13.938
- That's what you remember?
- You remember it, don't you?

39:13.939 --> 39:17.975
- You make pancakes every day.
- Because I'm bored.

39:17.976 --> 39:20.605
No. Because you're
punishing yourself.

39:21.585 --> 39:24.165
You called this place your hell.
That means you feel remorse.

39:25.884 --> 39:28.113
That's what makes you
different than Kai.

39:30.236 --> 39:31.826
It means there's hope for you.

39:34.275 --> 39:37.861
Look. We can still
get out of here, Bonnie.

39:38.355 --> 39:40.497
We can just steal
that ascendant contraption,

39:40.498 --> 39:42.613
find out what Kai knows.
We'll ditch him.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.269
Because he doesn't have
any powers anyway.

39:44.270 --> 39:46.570
Kai: Actually, it's not
that simple.

39:46.571 --> 39:49.239
You got to stop doing that.
It's creepy.

39:49.240 --> 39:53.150
Here's the thing.
I have a peculiar effect on magic.

39:53.151 --> 39:55.145
I can't generate it myself,

39:55.146 --> 39:59.332
but I can consume it
from others temporarily.

39:59.893 --> 40:02.335
Family called me an abomination.

40:02.633 --> 40:03.845
That hurt my feelings.

40:05.356 --> 40:06.823
Unh!

40:06.825 --> 40:09.593
[Groaning]

40:09.594 --> 40:12.553
Ok. We get it. Ugh.

40:15.532 --> 40:17.927
You can see why my coven
and I didn't get along.

40:19.137 --> 40:20.646
I smell an ultimatum.

40:20.647 --> 40:23.745
If I consume all
of Bonnie's magic,

40:23.746 --> 40:26.727
I am just gonna
end up killing her,

40:27.512 --> 40:29.517
but if we work together,

40:29.518 --> 40:31.814
we can all go home as friends,

40:33.184 --> 40:34.818
or I can devour her magic,

40:34.819 --> 40:37.221
kill you both
and go home alone.

40:41.258 --> 40:42.370
What's it gonna be?

[Door opens]

41:03.681 --> 41:05.481
Hello?

[Clang]

Ivy.

41:21.198 --> 41:23.830
Stefan, I don't feel so good.

41:25.235 --> 41:27.036
Your friend Enzo
made me drink his blood,

41:27.037 --> 41:29.717
and now I'm just so thirsty.
