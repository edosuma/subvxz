00:02.403 --> 00:03.371
HEY.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.373
- HEY, MORNING.
- HEY.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.676
- MORNING, DADDY.
- GOOD MORNING.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.311
ANYTHING FOR BREAKFAST?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.312
- HOW ABOUT PANCAKES?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.346
- AH, GREAT.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.514
- WE NEED EGGS, BUTTER,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.549
MILK, SYRUP,
AND PANCAKE MIX.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.422
AND WHILE YOU'RE OUT,
COULD YOU GO TO THE BANK,

00:21.455 --> 00:24.125
THE HARDWARE STORE,
AND THE DRY CLEANER'S?

00:24.158 --> 00:27.161
- I'LL JUST HAVE CEREAL.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.696
- COME ON, RAY.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.031
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY
WHILE I'M AT WORK?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.303
- I ENTERTAIN MEN, RAY.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.438
COME ON, ALLY.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.209
- GREAT NEWS, RAY.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.476
YOU'RE IN.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.579
- WHAT AM I IN,
AND DOES IT WASH OFF?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.448
- RAY,

00:47.481 --> 00:51.085
EVERY MAN HAS
CERTAIN MOMENTS IN LIFE

00:51.119 --> 00:56.124
THAT DEFINE WHO HE IS
IN THE GREAT CIRCLE OF...

00:56.157 --> 00:57.725
LIFE.

00:57.758 --> 01:01.095
TONIGHT YOU AND I
ARE HAVING SUCH A MOMENT.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.730
- I'M NOT GETTING NAKED

01:02.763 --> 01:04.732
AND LET YOU HOLD ME UP
TO THE MOON, DAD...

01:07.135 --> 01:09.670
NOT AGAIN.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.871
- POKER.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.207
WITH ME AND THE BOYS.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.209
- NO, DAD, PLEASE.
WHY DON'T YOU ASK ROBERT?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.810
- WELL, YOUR BROTHER'S A COP.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.879
HE'S VERY SENSITIVE
ABOUT THIS GAMBLING THING.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.681
WHAT IF HE TURNS US IN?

01:20.714 --> 01:21.849
- YOU'D LIKE JAIL.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.417
THEY HAVE CRAFTS.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.686
- I DON'T GET IT.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.155
YOU--
YOU SAYING NO TO ME?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.456
TO YOUR FATHER?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.557
- DAD, I'M NOT SAYING NO.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.426
I JUST--
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.428
- DON'T WANT TO GO?
- YEAH.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.629
- AFTER THE WAY
YOU HOUNDED ME

01:35.663 --> 01:37.731
ALL THOSE YEARS
IN HIGH SCHOOL TO PLAY?

01:37.765 --> 01:41.569
- WHEN DID I HOUND YOU
TO PLAY CARDS WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.204
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.473
SO WE DIDN'T TALK MUCH
DURING THE HIGH SCHOOL YEARS.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.709
I-I KNOW I KIND OF
LOST TRACK OF YOU.

01:48.742 --> 01:49.843
I'M SORRY.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.445
ANYWAY, WE GOT FOUR GUYS.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.514
WE NEED A FIFTH.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.715
- COME ON. NO.
I HATE THOSE GUYS.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.350
ALL THEY DID
WAS MAKE FUN OF ME.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.286
- OH, THEY WON'T ANYMORE.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.222
YOUR HEAD'S
A NORMAL SIZE NOW.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.724
COME ON.
DO IT FOR THE OLD MAN.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.159
- OH, PLEASE.
DO I HAVE TO?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.527
- ATTABOY.
ATTABOY.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.329
10:00 AT NEMO'S.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.630
IT'S A WILD TIME, RAY.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.299
BETTER THAN VEGAS.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.601
FOOD, FUN, FAST ACTION.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.604
HEY, THE NEW GUY
BRINGS THE MAALOX.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.416
HEY, NEMO,
WHAT'D YOU MAKE TONIGHT?

02:28.449 --> 02:29.783
- LASAGNA MEATBALLS.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.552
- YOU MEAN
LASAGNA AND MEATBALLS?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.854
- NO, LASAGNA MEATBALLS.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.859
I HAD TO CLEAN OUT
THE FREEZER.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.927
- HEALTH INSPECTOR?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.364
- YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HIM?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.899
- LIKE YOU TALKED TO THE JUDGE
AT YOUR DIVORCE TRIAL, GARVIN?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.702
- HEY, I DID OKAY
ON THAT SETTLEMENT.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.671
- YOU'RE LIVING
AT THE FRIGGING "Y."

02:52.773 --> 02:55.376
HEY, HERE HE IS.
HERE'S MY BOY.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.377
- HERE I AM.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.611
- HEY, RAY.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.679
[laughs]

03:01.915 --> 03:03.551
- THIS IT, DAD?
THIS EVERYBODY?

03:03.584 --> 03:06.220
- RAY, THIS KAVUTCH SAYS

03:06.254 --> 03:08.456
HE WOULD ONLY PICK CHANGE
OUT OF A URINAL

03:08.489 --> 03:10.524
IF IT WAS MORE
THAN A BUCK.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.327
- SOME OF US
HAVE PRINCIPLES.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.962
- SOME OF US HAVE 87 CENTS.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.530
- [laughs]

03:16.564 --> 03:17.998
- RAY.
- HEY, RAY.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.567
- HEY.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.737
- SO, RAY,
YOU FEEL LIKE A WINNER?

03:23.771 --> 03:24.705
- NOT REALLY.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.708
- SIT DOWN, RAY,
OVER HERE,

03:27.741 --> 03:29.343
BY MY GOOD EAR.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.311
- TINNITUS.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.312
- WHA?

03:31.345 --> 03:34.515
[laughter]

03:34.548 --> 03:39.353
[coughing]

03:39.387 --> 03:40.954
- COME ON, GUYS.

03:40.988 --> 03:44.558
THIS IS HOW THE EBOLA VIRUS
STARTED.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.529
- ANTE UP, SEVEN-CARD,
NO PEEKY.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.997
- ISN'T THIS GREAT?

03:50.030 --> 03:54.502
MY KID AND MY PALS BONDING
OVER A REAL MAN'S GAME.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.870
- NO PEEKY.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.840
- SO, RAY, YOU STILL DOING
THAT SPORTSWRITING THING?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.642
- YEAH.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.777
- HEY, TELL THEM ABOUT ALL
THE AWARDS YOU WON THIS YEAR.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.612
- ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, DAD.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.747
- AWARDS!
WOW!

04:06.780 --> 04:08.849
WHO WOULD HAVE MADE
THAT BET, HUH?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.551
- WHAT?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.885
- NOTHING PERSONAL,

04:11.919 --> 04:14.488
BUT YOU HAD THE BIGGEST HEAD
I'D EVER SEEN ON A KID.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.457
- IT WAS HUGE!

04:16.490 --> 04:17.725
- FREAKISH.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.693
- WE USED TO GET CALLS
FROM THE CIRCUS.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.662
[laughter]

04:21.695 --> 04:22.896
- ALL RIGHT,
ARE WE GONNA PLAY CARDS,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.698
OR ARE WE GONNA
MAKE FUN OF ME ALL NIGHT?

04:24.732 --> 04:25.899
- DON'T WORRY, KID.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.535
WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME
FOR BOTH.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.304
[laughter]

04:30.338 --> 04:37.077
[hacking cough]

04:37.110 --> 04:39.913
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE PHLEGMTONES.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.683
[laughter]

04:48.789 --> 04:50.591
I'LL, UH--

04:50.624 --> 04:53.361
I'LL MAKE A BET
THAT'S AS BIG AS MY HEAD.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.404
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DAD?

05:03.437 --> 05:04.805
- I'M STACKING YOUR CHIPS.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.640
- STACK YOUR OWN CHIPS, DAD--

05:06.674 --> 05:08.075
ALL THREE OF 'EM.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.412
- YOU'RE BLUFFING, RAYMOND.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.780
I CALL.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.947
- YOU CALL?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.584
YOU BETTER CALL A DOCTOR.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.487
FULL HOUSE:
QUEENS OVER 8s.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.122
SORRY, GUYS.
I'M IN THE ZONE.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.958
- HEY, RAY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO WIN ALL THE MONEY.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.895
- YEAH, WELL, PERHAPS
I HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.997
YOU KNOW, ALL NIGHT,
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO READ

05:30.030 --> 05:32.900
THE REFLECTION OF YOUR CARDS
OFF YOUR SHINY NOGGINS.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.071
- HEY, HEY,
A LITTLE RESPECT.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.108
- DON'T WORRY.
THE KID'S DONE WINNING.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.910
IT'S TIME
FOR A MAN'S GAME.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.645
FIVE-CARD DRAW.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.514
NO DRAW.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.749
- THAT MEANS YOU PLAY
THE FIVE CARDS YOU'RE DEALT.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.384
- YEAH, I FIGURED IT OUT, DAD.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.390
- ANYBODY GOT ANY ANTACID
OR BICARBONATE OF SODA?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.626
- NO.
- I DON'T.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.695
- IN THAT CASE, I FOLD.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.763
- I'LL OPEN.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.035
- TAKE IT EASY.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.136
- DAD, WHAT?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.739
YOU DON'T TELL YOUR PALS
TO TAKE IT EASY.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.040
- THEY'RE NOT MY SON.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.009
- WELL, I'M NOT YOUR SON
HERE EITHER, DAD--FRANK.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.113
WE'RE EQUALS.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.517
- I'M OUT.
- I'M OUT.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.085
- WHAT, ARE YOU SHOWING OFF?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.554
THIS IS JUST LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE A KID

06:26.587 --> 06:29.857
AND YOU'D SHOVE THE COCOA PUFFS
UP YOUR NOSE.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.726
I RAISE YOU 50.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.128
- I WAS SIX THEN,

06:35.162 --> 06:36.964
AND THEY SMELLED GOOD.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.638
I SEE YOU 50,
AND I RAISE YOU 50.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.641
- I TOLD YOU DON'T PUT
THE COCOA PUFFS UP YOUR NOSE.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.209
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

06:49.242 --> 06:52.780
YOU SHOVE 25 OF THEM
UP THERE.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.583
WE GOT TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.985
I SEE YOU,

06:58.018 --> 06:59.887
AND I RAISE YOU.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.123
- WELL, DAD,

07:03.156 --> 07:06.193
WHATEVER YOU SPENT
AT THE HOSPITAL THAT NIGHT,

07:06.226 --> 07:10.564
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE
TO MAKE IT ALL BACK.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.735
- HOLY CRAP!
- HOLY CRAP!

07:21.609 --> 07:24.144
[toys clattering and squeaking]

07:26.814 --> 07:28.482
- HI, HONEY.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.817
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.819
WHY ARE YOU HOME SO LATE?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.855
- 'CAUSE I--
I WON A LOT OF MONEY.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.024
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.796
- THEN I LOST SOME.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.201
- HOW MUCH?

07:48.235 --> 07:51.505
- OH, GO--GO TO SLEEP.
GO TO SLEEP.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.673
- WELL, HOW MUCH?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.708
- NOT ENOUGH
TO LOSE SLEEP OVER.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.943
- COME ON,
JUST TELL ME.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.112
- SLEEP.
- RAY!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.213
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T SLEEP,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.583
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE
CRANKY TOMORROW.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.568
- DID YOU LOSE MORE THAN $50?

08:22.703 --> 08:23.937
- YEAH.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.074
- YOU DIDN'T LOSE $100,
DID YOU?

08:27.107 --> 08:28.141
- NO.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.179
HUNDREDS.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.650
- HOW MANY HUNDREDS?

08:36.684 --> 08:37.851
- [muffled]

08:39.653 --> 08:41.054
- WHAT?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.122
- [muffled]

08:44.124 --> 08:45.192
- WHAT?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.627
- ROAD AND FRICK.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.169
- RAY, HOW MANY HUNDREDS?
- 23.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.171
- [gasps]
- TO MY DAD.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.908
- YOU LOST $2,300
TO YOUR FATHER?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.109
- RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.310
WE'RE GONNA GET
THE MONEY BACK.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.912
- HOW?
- WHEN HE DIES.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.146
- OH!

09:15.923 --> 09:18.191
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LOST ALL THAT MONEY.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.594
- LOOK,
IT'S MY DAD'S FAULT.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.864
HE KEPT TELLING ME TO FOLD
LIKE I WAS A LITTLE KID.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.167
- OH, SO YOU SHOWED HIM
BY LOSING ALL YOUR MONEY TO HIM.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.602
- THAT'S RIGHT.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.137
I'M MY OWN MAN.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.276
- RAY, YOU KNOW,
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

09:36.309 --> 09:39.112
WE HAVE THREE KIDS
TO PUT THROUGH COLLEGE.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.748
- WELL,
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY

09:40.781 --> 09:42.883
AND THEY WON'T BE
COLLEGE MATERIAL.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.724
- YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT WE WERE SAVING

09:50.758 --> 09:51.759
TO BUY A BIGGER HOUSE

09:51.792 --> 09:54.662
SO WE COULD
MOVE AWAY FROM--

09:54.695 --> 09:55.796
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.668
- LOOK, YOU THINK I WANTED
TO LOSE THAT MUCH MONEY?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.102
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG,

10:02.135 --> 10:04.271
BUT YOU GOT TO KNOW
I HAD A VERY GOOD REASON.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.273
- YOU HAD A VERY GOOD REASON?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.008
- IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR FATHER
TELLS YOU

10:08.041 --> 10:09.777
NOT TO PUT COCOA PUFFS
UP YOUR NOSE.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.112
- OH, NOT THE COCOA PUFF
STORY AGAIN, RAY.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.881
- WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU WANT TO DO?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.684
PUT COCOA PUFFS
UP YOUR NOSE.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.218
- SO NOW YOU'RE...

10:18.251 --> 10:19.753
CUCKOO.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.723
- DON'T YOU SEE?

10:22.756 --> 10:24.758
IT'S JUST THE SAME THING
AS 30 YEARS AGO.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.059
HE KEPT TELLING ME
TO STOP BETTING,

10:26.093 --> 10:27.027
SO THE FIRST THING--

10:27.060 --> 10:28.696
- ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.
I GET IT. I GET IT.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.431
- GOOD. OKAY, GOOD.
I FEEL BETTER.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.033
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST FORGET

10:33.066 --> 10:35.769
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.438
- JUST FORGET ABOUT $2,300?

10:38.471 --> 10:42.876
- OKAY, YOU WANT TO BEAT IT
INTO THE GROUND.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.946
- I'M JUST--I'M THANKFUL
THAT YOU LOST IT TO YOUR FATHER.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.047
- WHY?

10:47.080 --> 10:49.149
- BECAUSE YOU CAN GO OVER THERE
AND ASK FOR IT BACK.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.283
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.785
- WHY?

10:51.819 --> 10:54.154
- I'M NOT A CHILD.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.825
- OH, NO, YOU'RE A MATURE ADULT
WHO LOST $2,300

10:57.858 --> 11:00.660
BECAUSE HIS DADDY
TOLD HIM NOT TO.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.265
- ALL RIGHT,
I AM A CHILD.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.703
BUT IF I GO BACK
AND ASK FOR THE MONEY BACK,

11:09.737 --> 11:12.873
THEN I'M A BABY.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.407
I DON'T WANT TO BE A BABY.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.747
- QUIT PUSHING!

11:19.780 --> 11:22.015
- GO AHEAD.
DO IT.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.717
- I'M NOT GIVING
RAY'S CHECK BACK.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.318
I WON IT FAIR AND SQUARE.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.854
- OH, IF YOU DON'T
GIVE RAY HIS MONEY,

11:26.887 --> 11:29.056
YOU'RE NOT THE MAN I MARRIED.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.858
- I WIN AGAIN.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.997
- I CAN'T TAKE
THE MONEY BACK, MA.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.998
- YES, YOU CAN.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.266
- FRANK, PLEASE.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.836
- FORGET IT.
I WANT TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.138
DON'T GET IN
OVER YOUR HEAD.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.308
PLAY WITH FIRE,
YOU'RE GONNA GET BURNED.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.477
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

11:50.510 --> 11:51.845
THANK YOU.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.913
COME AGAIN.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.384
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING!

11:57.417 --> 11:59.319
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DEPRIVE
YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD

11:59.352 --> 12:02.055
OF MONEY HE NEEDS
TO FEED HIS FAMILY?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.024
- WE'RE OKAY, MA.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.259
- LOOK HOW THEY LIVE
OVER HERE, FRANK--

12:06.293 --> 12:07.895
THE WANT.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.064
- WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE?

12:11.098 --> 12:13.300
- NOTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.969
- I'M A POLICEMAN.
I COME HOME AT 3:00 A.M.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.537
NO MOM, NO DAD,
NO SANDWICH.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.106
I START TO WORRY.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.308
- OH, ROBBIE,
IT'S THE WORST.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.376
OH, I'VE NEVER BEEN SO UPSET
IN MY LIFE.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.846
- DON'T TELL HIM.
HE'S A COP.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.350
- TELL ME WHAT?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.919
- NOTHING.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.056
- RAY AND FRANK
PLAYED POKER TONIGHT,

12:36.089 --> 12:40.360
AND RAY LOST $2,300
TO YOUR FATHER.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.395
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM
I CRY DURING SEX?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.763
- OH--

12:51.304 --> 12:54.474
- YOU PLAYED
FOR REAL MONEY?

12:54.507 --> 12:56.409
YOU--YOU BROKE THE LAW?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.912
- WE GAMBLED.
NOBODY GOT HURT.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.981
- I SEE, SO IT'S NOT
AGAINST THE LAW

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
UNLESS SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.318
INTERESTING.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.120
- ROBERT, WANT SOME ICE CREAM?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.089
- NO, NO.
CAN'T STAY.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.591
GOT TO GO TELL THE PUSHERS
AND THE MUGGERS

13:11.624 --> 13:13.260
AND THE LADIES OF THE EVENING

13:13.293 --> 13:15.562
THAT IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW
UNLESS SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.004
MIO FAMIGLIA.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.440
[mumbling in Italian]

13:34.014 --> 13:35.215
- HELLO, SWEETHEART.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.917
- HI, GRANDMA.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.618
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.253
- WE'RE FROSTING CUPCAKES.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.891
- OH, HOW NICE.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.458
FROSTING FROM A CAN.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.260
SO MUCH EASIER
THAN HOMEMADE.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.430
- WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, MARIE?

13:50.463 --> 13:54.401
- DARLING, WILL YOU GO WASH
YOUR FACE FOR GRANDMA, HUH?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.203
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.
THANKS.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.940
THIS IS FOR YOU.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.108
- [gasps]

14:01.141 --> 14:02.342
BUT I THOUGHT FRANK SAID--

14:02.375 --> 14:03.944
- NO, HE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

14:03.977 --> 14:04.945
THIS IS MY MONEY.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.379
- YOU HAVE MONEY?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.547
- OH.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.583
MY FATHER--
OH, SUCH A WISE MAN.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.086
ON MY WEDDING DAY,
HE TOOK ME ASIDE,

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
GAVE ME $200, AND SAID,

14:14.587 --> 14:16.924
"HERE, THIS IS IF YOU EVER
COME TO YOUR SENSES

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
AND LEAVE FRANK."

14:18.992 --> 14:20.160
- WOW.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.063
MY DAD ONLY GAVE ME $50.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.298
- SO FOR 45 YEARS NOW,

14:25.332 --> 14:27.167
I'VE BEEN ADDING TO IT
LITTLE BY LITTLE.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.971
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
MY MARRIAGE WILL LAST, RIGHT?

14:31.004 --> 14:34.007
I MEAN, MONEY IS FREEDOM.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.475
- SO HOW FREE ARE YOU?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.512
- $46,000.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.448
- WHAT?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.016
- YUP.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.652
JUST--
IT'S OUR SECRET, NOW.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.220
- HI.
- HI.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.621
- HI, MA.
- HI, DEAR.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.622
- HOW YOU DOING?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.224
- FINE.
- FINE.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.625
- OKAY, DEBRA,
GIVE MOM THE MONEY BACK.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.030
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.598
- COME ON,
LOOK AT YOU TWO, HUH?

14:58.631 --> 15:01.168
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TWO WERE SMILING TOGETHER?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.605
EXACTLY.
NOW, GIVE IT BACK TO HER.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.107
- OH, RAY, PLEASE.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.108
- NO, NO, MA, NO.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.310
GET OUT OF HERE.
NO. GO.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.611
- LOOK, IF YOU TAKE--

15:11.644 --> 15:13.480
- DON'T MAKE ME
TURN THE HOSE ON YOU.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.985
MA.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.319
THANKS.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.554
- YOU'RE WELCOME,
YOU STUBBORN ASS.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.395
- YOU WERE GONNA KEEP
THAT MONEY, WEREN'T YOU?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.064
- OH, RAY, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU
AND YOUR STUPID PRIDE

15:31.098 --> 15:32.699
TRYING TO OUTDO YOUR DAD,

15:32.732 --> 15:35.002
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE LOST
THAT MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.536
- WRONG, ALL RIGHT?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.138
I HAPPEN TO STINK AT POKER,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.473
AND I WOULD HAVE
LOST THE MONEY ANYWAY.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.109
THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU KNOW.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.292
- YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO ME?

15:59.326 --> 16:01.594
- NOPE.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.730
- I JUST KEEP WINNING.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.402
- OH, HI, RAY.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.504
- LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN ALLY'S PIGGY BANK--

16:11.538 --> 16:13.706
$2,300.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.774
- OH.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.609
ISN'T SHE THRIFTY?

16:16.643 --> 16:17.710
- YEAH.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.546
COME ON, MA, HUH?

16:19.579 --> 16:20.780
I'LL TELL YOU,
IT WASN'T EASY

16:20.813 --> 16:23.316
TRYING TO WRESTLE IT
OUT OF HER HANDS.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.651
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:24.684 --> 16:27.020
- I GAVE HIM $2,300.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.555
WE'RE NOT KEEPING
HIS MONEY.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.590
- WHERE DID YOU GET
$2,300?

16:30.623 --> 16:31.758
- NEVER MIND.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.660
- I DON'T WANT IT, MA.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.596
- ALL RIGHT, FREEZE.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.066
- ROBBIE,
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.501
- OH, I'M AT WORK RIGHT NOW.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.702
I HEARD THE WHOLE THING.

16:42.735 --> 16:43.803
THIS COULD GET UGLY, MOM.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.272
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.673
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO LEAVE MY OWN KITCHEN?

16:46.706 --> 16:47.774
- NOW!

16:49.609 --> 16:52.345
PLEASE.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.547
- LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO MY BOYS!

16:56.549 --> 16:58.318
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
SIT DOWN.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.619
- OH, COME ON.
- RIGHT NOW.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.154
THE BOTH OF YOUSE.
LET'S GO.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.255
RIGHT HERE.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.793
YOU GUYS WANT A CUP OF COFFEE?
- OKAY.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.695
- WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
HOW IT GOES.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.832
NOW, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT, OKAY?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.235
THE BOTH OF YOU
BROKE THE LAW,

17:15.268 --> 17:16.669
THE LAW THAT I'VE SWORN
TO UPHOLD.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.072
NOW, THE ONLY THING
THAT COULD ALTER THAT FACT

17:19.106 --> 17:21.608
IS IF NO MONEY CHANGED HANDS
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION

17:21.641 --> 17:24.277
AT ONE NEMO'S PIZZERIA

17:24.311 --> 17:26.613
AND HOMEMADE SPECIALTIES.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.481
- THIS IS BETWEEN
ME AND DAD, ROBERT.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.551
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE PERFECTLY FINE.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.456
- EVERYTHING'S
PERFECTLY FINE, HUH?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.757
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW

17:37.790 --> 17:39.726
THAT YOU'RE THE TIP
OF THE ICEBERG?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.462
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, POPS,
AND WHEN YOU DO,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.131
YOU'RE GONNA BRING DOWN
EDDIE AND STAN

17:44.164 --> 17:46.766
AND THAT DIVORCED GARVIN.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.502
- ROBERT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.338
- OH, I'M NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING, HUH?

17:51.371 --> 17:54.241
YOU WANT TO TRY ME?
COME ON!

17:57.344 --> 17:59.379
LISTEN, KID.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.813
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.715
IT'S--
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

18:02.749 --> 18:05.285
'CAUSE YOU GOT MIXED UP
WITH A BAD ELEMENT.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.224
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:11.258 --> 18:13.626
- WELL, GOOD COP/BAD COP.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.362
IT'S JUST TAKING ME
A LITTLE LONGER

18:15.395 --> 18:17.130
'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.143
- I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.445
IT'S BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
INVITE YOU TO PLAY.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.282
- NO, NO, MY SECOND-RATE STATUS
IN THIS FAMILY

18:35.315 --> 18:38.618
HAS NO BEARING ON MY
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.320
- THERE'S ANOTHER GAME
NEXT WEEK.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.721
- TOO LATE.
- ENOUGH ALREADY.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.256
LOOK, I'M LEAVING,
ALL RIGHT?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.158
AND FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'M NOT TAKING THE MONEY.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.760
I LOST IT, THAT'S ALL.
I'M A BIG BOY.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.329
ALL RIGHT,
IF I TAKE THE MONEY,

18:49.362 --> 18:51.831
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
DOES THAT SEND TO MY KIDS?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.300
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

18:53.333 --> 18:54.501
YOU CAN JUST GO
TO YOUR FATHER

18:54.534 --> 18:56.469
AND HE'LL MAKE
EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.340
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.411
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.579
- WHAT?
WHAT AM I RIGHT ABOUT?

19:08.981 --> 19:12.519
- YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GO TO YOUR FATHER,

19:12.552 --> 19:15.222
AND HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT OKAY.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.262
HERE, BE A GOOD FATHER,
BIG HEAD.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.398
- DAD--

19:29.402 --> 19:31.404
THANKS.
THANKS, DAD.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.511
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.913
- I'M JUST GLAD
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.350
I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO CUFF YOU GUYS.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.288
- I'M GLAD TOO.

19:50.022 --> 19:54.761
AND, UH, IT MIGHT HAVE
WORKED OUT VERY WELL.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.828
- HEY!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.497
THAT'S STILL MY MONEY.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.979
- WELL, YOU WANTED
TO PLAY CARDS.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.781
WE'RE PLAYING CARDS.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.749
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

20:16.783 --> 20:17.784
- A PAIR OF 5s.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.519
- [laughs]

20:19.552 --> 20:21.521
FULL HOUSE:
JACKS OVER 8s.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.657
OKAY, DIAMOND JIM,
TAKE IT OFF.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.809
- I'M COLD.
