00:00.373 --> 00:01.345
Previously on <i>One Tree Hill...</i>

00:01.445 --> 00:03.045
We should probably make
this Agent thing official.

00:03.111 --> 00:04.144
<i>Just get me</i>
<i>your college transcripts,</i>

00:04.229 --> 00:05.195
and -- and I'll
set it all up.

00:06.126 --> 00:07.343
I never graduated.

00:07.427 --> 00:09.145
You've got to have
a college degree to do this.

00:09.229 --> 00:11.013
So I think you should
go get those credits.

00:11.098 --> 00:11.981
Oops, didn't realize
you already scored.

00:12.065 --> 00:13.099
My bad.

00:13.150 --> 00:14.633
With Chase
or in the game?

00:14.684 --> 00:17.436
They're fighting over Chase.
I know who he likes.

00:17.487 --> 00:19.655
<i>I think I should just be</i>
<i>by myself for a while.</i>

00:24.644 --> 00:27.746
<i>Okay, Brooke Davis,</i>
<i>this is it --</i>

00:27.814 --> 00:30.249
<i>the day</i>
<i>you've always dreamed about.</i>

00:30.316 --> 00:32.668
<i>Don't cry.</i>
<i>You still have pictures.</i>

00:32.752 --> 00:36.172
<i>And don't trip.</i>
<i>You'll ruin your dress.</i>

00:37.591 --> 00:39.175
You look real pretty, baby.

00:47.801 --> 00:49.501
All right, y'all,
say cheese.

00:49.553 --> 00:51.604
Cheese!

All right, y'all,
we're fixin' to watch...

01:02.899 --> 01:05.851
Brooke and Julian
get hitched.

01:11.191 --> 01:12.024
Whoo!

01:12.075 --> 01:13.159
Yeah!

01:14.578 --> 01:16.245
Whoo!

01:16.329 --> 01:18.297
Now, where'd those rings
run off to?

01:19.916 --> 01:23.368
James Lucas Scott,
are you drinking a beer?

01:23.420 --> 01:25.204
What kind of backyard hootenanny
and pig roast

01:25.255 --> 01:26.388
would this be without it?

01:26.473 --> 01:28.057
Pig roast?
Yeah, that's right, baby.

01:28.141 --> 01:30.476
Remember, we got the edible-ring-bearer
special to save money?

01:38.768 --> 01:40.903
This is not my wedding.

01:40.987 --> 01:42.905
It sure is, and I think
it's time you accept it.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.448
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:52.532 --> 01:55.234
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby!

01:55.285 --> 01:58.204
Let's forget about the ceremony
and drink to the honeymoon.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.183
"Impossible."

02:11.251 --> 02:12.417
"Impossible."

02:12.469 --> 02:15.788
I-m-p-o-s-s...

02:15.855 --> 02:17.306
I-b-l-e?

02:17.390 --> 02:18.440
"Impossible."

02:18.525 --> 02:20.025
See, there you go.
Nice work.

02:20.093 --> 02:21.927
Sometimes it pays
to go with your gut.

02:21.978 --> 02:24.596
All right, let's do, uh...

02:24.648 --> 02:26.949
..."Broccoli."

02:27.033 --> 02:28.317
Oh, gross.

02:28.401 --> 02:29.601
That doesn't go with my gut.

02:29.653 --> 02:31.203
Please don't put that
in my lunch.

02:31.271 --> 02:33.322
Only if you spell it wrong.

02:33.406 --> 02:35.407
Okay.
"Broccoli."

02:35.458 --> 02:38.544
B-r-o-c-o--

02:38.611 --> 02:39.712
no, no, no, no.

02:39.779 --> 02:42.948
"Broccoli."
B-r-o-c-c-o-l-I.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.949
"Broccoli."

02:44.000 --> 02:45.384
Nice save.

02:45.451 --> 02:47.169
Let's put it in dad's.

02:47.287 --> 02:49.838
So, are you getting excited
for your spelling bee?

02:49.906 --> 02:52.308
As much as I can
for a spelling bee.

02:52.392 --> 02:55.294
What? I loved spelling bees
when I was your age.

02:55.345 --> 02:56.395
Yeah.
Dad said you were a nerd.

02:57.630 --> 02:59.848
Hey, you tell our kid
I was a nerd?

02:59.933 --> 03:02.134
Yeah, many times.
I'm not gonna lie to the kid, Hales.

03:03.803 --> 03:05.738
You do realize I'm going
to college, not third grade.

03:05.805 --> 03:07.973
Oh, you -- you don't want
chocolate pudding?

03:10.977 --> 03:12.644
Come on.
I'll drop you off.

03:12.696 --> 03:13.979
Sweet.

03:14.030 --> 03:16.198
Here you go, kiddo.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.449
Have a fun day
at school, boys.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.584
Oh, yes!

03:18.651 --> 03:19.868
I got ho hos.

03:19.953 --> 03:21.787
Nope.
You got broccoli.

03:23.923 --> 03:25.591
I wouldn't even consider
leaving you

03:25.658 --> 03:27.176
if it weren't
really important.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.261
But I need to check in
with my clients to --

03:29.329 --> 03:31.830
Don't worry.
I understand.

03:31.881 --> 03:33.682
Then why won't you
come with me?

03:33.767 --> 03:36.101
Because I have a lot of work
to do on my photos.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.836
And I think I might
go see Taylor.

03:37.887 --> 03:39.355
But I am gonna miss you.

03:41.358 --> 03:44.109
I'm gonna miss you, too.

03:48.648 --> 03:50.515
Hello?

03:50.567 --> 03:52.284
Haley, are you sitting down?
Um...

03:52.352 --> 03:53.986
Sort of.
Okay, good.

03:54.037 --> 03:56.955
Because I just booked kid Cudi
at Tric.

03:57.690 --> 03:59.958
You w--

04:00.026 --> 04:01.493
What?

04:01.544 --> 04:02.527
When?

04:02.579 --> 04:04.046
Tomorrow night.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.130
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

04:05.198 --> 04:07.032
Yeah, he had an opening
on his tour,

04:07.083 --> 04:08.384
and I just grabbed it.

04:08.468 --> 04:10.135
Plus, I was thinking
Erin should open.

04:10.203 --> 04:12.171
Oh, I love that idea.

04:12.222 --> 04:15.641
Yeah, just sucks that nobody
shows up for opening acts.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.642
Yeah.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.543
Let me see what I can do
about that.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.017
Nathan Scott?

04:26.603 --> 04:27.853
It <i>is</i> you.

04:27.904 --> 04:29.071
What are you doing here?

04:29.155 --> 04:30.272
Finishing up my degree.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.723
I'm actually
just trying to decide

04:31.775 --> 04:34.393
which business course to take --
Stewart or Kellerman.

04:34.444 --> 04:35.744
Oh, Stewart, no question.

04:35.829 --> 04:37.196
All the athletes take him

04:37.247 --> 04:40.115
because you can sleep through
the classes and still pass.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.250
It's cake.

04:41.334 --> 04:42.584
Yeah, but do you
learn anything?

04:42.669 --> 04:44.453
You learn how to sleep
sitting up.

04:44.537 --> 04:46.538
But I definitely
wouldn't take Kellerman.

04:46.589 --> 04:47.873
I hear he's impossible.

04:47.924 --> 04:50.259
Thanks, man.
No problem.

04:53.263 --> 04:54.513
Dr. Kellerman:
Yes?

07:03.895 --> 07:05.646
You look familiar.

07:05.713 --> 07:07.731
Did we sleep together?

07:07.815 --> 07:10.484
No.
I'm Haley's sister.

07:10.551 --> 07:13.270
Oh, so you slept
with my son.

07:13.354 --> 07:14.104
That was Taylor.

07:15.657 --> 07:17.557
Oh, right.

07:17.609 --> 07:20.494
So, you're the sister
who wants to talk about murder.

07:20.562 --> 07:22.829
Why come to me?
I'm not a hit man.

07:28.069 --> 07:29.870
Because you're
the only person I know

07:29.921 --> 07:31.171
who's ever
murdered someone,

07:31.238 --> 07:33.707
and anyone else
is gonna try to stop me.

07:33.758 --> 07:36.260
But not Dan Scott,
the reprehensible monster

07:36.344 --> 07:38.095
who flips burgers
for a living.

07:38.179 --> 07:39.412
That's not what I meant.

07:39.464 --> 07:40.681
What did you mean?

07:40.748 --> 07:43.183
A woman tried to kill me
and the man that I love.

07:43.250 --> 07:46.270
And I'm angry, and when
I'm not angry, I'm afraid.

07:46.354 --> 07:49.273
Or at least I used to be.

07:49.357 --> 07:50.891
Not anymore.

07:50.942 --> 07:52.859
You're not afraid anymore?

07:54.062 --> 07:56.313
You should be.

08:04.989 --> 08:06.773
Have a seat.

08:10.495 --> 08:13.279
So, how are the bridesmaids'
dresses coming along?

08:13.331 --> 08:14.948
When do I
get to see mine?

08:14.999 --> 08:18.652
Honestly...
I have no idea.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.721
Your dress,
even my dress --

08:20.788 --> 08:23.456
inspiration
has been nonexistent lately.

08:23.508 --> 08:25.926
I literally had my entire
dream wedding planned out.

08:25.977 --> 08:27.511
And now
I'm redoing everything,

08:27.595 --> 08:30.180
and the more
that I think about it,

08:30.264 --> 08:31.565
the more frustrated I get.

08:31.633 --> 08:32.982
I'm sorry, Brooke.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.518
It's okay.

08:34.602 --> 08:38.605
Inspiration was just so much
easier to find when I had money.

08:40.474 --> 08:42.943
Okay, you know what?
Out of sight, out of mind.

08:42.994 --> 08:45.195
You need a clear head in order
to find your inspiration..

08:45.279 --> 08:47.247
It's obvious this book
is only confusing you.

08:51.318 --> 08:52.869
You want to play "Madden"
with me?

08:52.954 --> 08:54.338
I'll let you be
the Falcons.

08:54.422 --> 08:55.789
I'd love to, buddy.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.941
But I really got to concentrate
on this right now.

08:58.009 --> 08:59.426
This is
a really hard class.

08:59.493 --> 09:01.128
Why don't you call Chuck?

09:01.179 --> 09:04.181
Can't. He's grounded
for using his name

09:04.265 --> 09:06.933
in the
"banana-fana-fo-fana" song.

09:07.001 --> 09:08.669
What?
What's wrong with that?

09:11.723 --> 09:13.106
Oh.

09:13.174 --> 09:16.176
Yeah.

09:16.227 --> 09:17.844
So, why is your class
so hard?

09:17.895 --> 09:20.147
Because I've never really
been good at school.

09:20.198 --> 09:22.149
And I got
a really hard teacher.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.317
Yeah.
Hard teachers suck.

09:24.369 --> 09:26.903
Try having Miss Lauren
for two years in a row.

09:28.489 --> 09:29.740
But I chose
this teacher.

09:29.824 --> 09:31.158
Why?

09:31.225 --> 09:33.710
Well, because sometimes
the hardest things

09:33.795 --> 09:35.295
are the most rewarding.

09:35.362 --> 09:38.715
Do you know what the most
important basketball game

09:38.800 --> 09:40.300
I ever played was?

09:40.367 --> 09:42.836
No. It was Kansas
my sophomore year.

09:42.887 --> 09:44.721
They were ranked
number one.

09:44.806 --> 09:45.806
And you beat them?

09:45.873 --> 09:47.174
No, we lost by 3.

09:47.225 --> 09:49.643
But we were
supposed to lose by 27.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.377
And if Kansas wasn't
such a hard team,

09:51.429 --> 09:52.646
we would've never learned

09:52.713 --> 09:54.481
to play defense the way we did
that game.

09:54.548 --> 09:55.849
And without that defense,

09:55.900 --> 09:57.601
we would've never made it
to the Final Four.

09:59.437 --> 10:02.072
It's when you face
the hardest things in life

10:02.156 --> 10:04.975
with will and hard work
that you learn the most.

10:05.043 --> 10:08.495
And that's why I chose
the hard teacher.

10:08.562 --> 10:09.996
That's good for you,
I guess.

10:11.282 --> 10:13.450
I just wish Miss Lauren
was a little easier, you know?

10:13.534 --> 10:14.901
It'll pay off.
Trust me.

10:14.952 --> 10:17.370
Hey, speaking of which,
isn't there a spelling bee

10:17.422 --> 10:18.588
you're supposed to
be studying for?

10:18.673 --> 10:20.090
Oh, yeah.
I'm ready.

10:20.174 --> 10:21.291
Oh, yeah? Okay.

10:21.375 --> 10:23.343
Spell "arbitrate."

10:23.410 --> 10:27.047
A-r-b-I-t-r-a-t-e.

10:27.098 --> 10:28.465
"Arbitrate."

10:28.549 --> 10:29.883
How did you get so smart?

10:29.934 --> 10:32.519
I have my mom's genes, too,
you know.

10:32.586 --> 10:33.804
You also got
her height.

10:33.888 --> 10:35.889
♪ Down around our toes ♪

10:35.940 --> 10:37.607
It was nauseating
watching them chum it up

10:37.692 --> 10:38.725
at Thanksgiving dinner.

10:38.776 --> 10:40.127
How are you
not at all annoyed

10:40.194 --> 10:41.812
that our mothers
have hit it off so well

10:41.896 --> 10:43.730
that they've scurried
off to New York together?

10:43.781 --> 10:46.233
If it means my mom being gone
and giving us time alone,

10:46.284 --> 10:47.451
I'm all for it.

10:47.535 --> 10:48.952
What are we looking for,
anyway?

10:49.036 --> 10:50.770
Inspiration.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.658
Ohh.
What's this?

10:54.742 --> 10:56.710
No, we can just get rid of that.
Ah.

10:56.777 --> 10:58.879
"Learn to speak French
watch every James Bond movie."

10:58.946 --> 11:00.413
What's this?

11:00.465 --> 11:03.416
It's a list Millie made for me
years ago when I was rich

11:03.468 --> 11:06.169
of all the things that
I always said I wanted to do.

11:06.254 --> 11:07.420
"Climb K2"?

11:07.472 --> 11:09.306
Is "lose my entire company"
on there?

11:09.390 --> 11:11.457
'Cause we can go ahead
and just cross that one off.

11:11.509 --> 11:13.059
"Go into outer space.
Get drunk at Oktoberfest."

11:13.127 --> 11:14.627
Did you ever do
any of these?

11:14.679 --> 11:16.346
No.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.848
But it was comforting
to know

11:17.932 --> 11:19.616
that I could've
anytime I wanted to.

11:19.684 --> 11:21.852
Maybe not space, but...

11:21.936 --> 11:24.204
Why didn't you ever do any
of these when you were rich?

11:24.272 --> 11:26.473
Too busy getting rich,
I guess.

11:27.658 --> 11:29.609
She shot us both
at close range.

11:29.660 --> 11:33.063
A surgery and a seven-day coma
later, I survived.

11:33.131 --> 11:36.633
And now I spend every night
afraid to sleep in my own home,

11:36.701 --> 11:37.968
worried what's gonna happen

11:38.035 --> 11:39.703
when she finds out
that we both lived.

11:39.770 --> 11:42.155
And on the rare nights
that I do actually sleep,

11:42.223 --> 11:43.123
I have nightmares.

11:43.191 --> 11:44.457
What kind of nightmares?

11:44.509 --> 11:46.827
About her coming back
to finish the job.

11:46.894 --> 11:49.045
I'm not gonna
let her do it.

11:49.130 --> 11:53.783
I've always preferred offense
over defense, but murder?

11:53.851 --> 11:57.103
We can't live like this.
<i>I</i> can't live like this anymore.

11:57.171 --> 11:59.172
So I'm not going to.

11:59.223 --> 12:01.391
And I don't trust the police.
They couldn't even find her.

12:04.228 --> 12:05.362
And I did.

12:07.681 --> 12:10.400
She's pretty.

12:10.484 --> 12:12.018
I can see why Evans
was sleeping with her.

12:12.069 --> 12:13.537
He wasn't.
That's too bad.

12:16.624 --> 12:19.476
If you do this...

12:19.544 --> 12:23.129
You'll lose a piece of yourself
that you'll never get back.

12:23.197 --> 12:24.965
I've already lost
that part.

12:25.032 --> 12:26.716
I'm trying to do something

12:26.801 --> 12:29.002
so I don't lose
everything else, too.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.474
All right,
I'll tell you what.

12:34.541 --> 12:35.892
Go get some sleep.

12:35.977 --> 12:40.380
And tomorrow, if you still
want to kill someone,

12:40.431 --> 12:42.399
you come and see me.

12:49.023 --> 12:50.399
I know that we said a 150

12:50.476 --> 12:53.361
but we're actually
gonna trim it down to 75.

12:53.429 --> 12:55.930
Well, how can it be more money
for less people?

12:57.316 --> 12:58.900
Well, now there's zero.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.777
<i>Bonjour!</i>
<i>Je suis Juliette.</i>

13:08.844 --> 13:12.163
<i>"Au revoir," "c'est la vie,"</i>
<i>"merci beaucoup" --</i>

13:12.248 --> 13:15.450
<i>these may be French phrases</i>
<i>you're familiar with now,</i>

13:15.501 --> 13:16.835
<i>but soon, you can live in Paris</i>

13:16.919 --> 13:19.254
<i>and never have to</i>
<i>speak English again.</i>

13:19.305 --> 13:20.588
<i>How does that sound?</i>

13:20.640 --> 13:22.007
That sounds amazing, actually.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.101
Wow.
Nathan Scott.

13:33.152 --> 13:34.102
Yeah.

13:34.153 --> 13:35.987
Uh, can I get a picture?

13:36.072 --> 13:39.024
Yeah, sure, man.
Thank you.

13:41.744 --> 13:43.161
Thank you so much.
Nice to meet you.

13:43.245 --> 13:45.646
Can I get an autograph?

13:45.698 --> 13:47.949
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

13:48.017 --> 13:49.501
If Mr. Scott doesn't mind,

13:49.585 --> 13:52.987
I'd love my students back
so I can begin my class.

13:55.624 --> 13:58.826
Let's start in chapter 12.

14:01.764 --> 14:03.481
You'll need
an industrial-grade hacksaw

14:03.549 --> 14:06.267
to properly detach the body
piece by piece,

14:06.335 --> 14:09.170
lye to speed up
the decomposition process,

14:09.221 --> 14:10.805
biodegradable plastic wrap

14:10.856 --> 14:12.807
to properly seal
and transport the pieces,

14:12.858 --> 14:15.944
a shovel to bury them,
obviously.

14:16.011 --> 14:19.064
Now, make sure you section
the body into 20 pieces,

14:19.148 --> 14:21.232
spreading them
at least five miles apart

14:21.317 --> 14:23.151
and no less
than 4 feet underground,

14:23.202 --> 14:25.820
although I recommend 6.

14:25.871 --> 14:28.656
Oh, and a hammer.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.125
Don't forget about
the dental records.

14:30.192 --> 14:32.360
Those will come back
to haunt you.

14:37.133 --> 14:39.000
Finding someone's easy.

14:39.051 --> 14:41.753
Making sure they're never found
again -- that's the hard part.

14:43.923 --> 14:45.256
From the look
on your face,

14:45.341 --> 14:46.591
you never thought
of any of this.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.595
This is what you want,
isn't it?

14:53.566 --> 14:55.216
I just...

14:55.267 --> 14:57.552
I want it all to stop.

14:57.603 --> 15:00.155
No. You don't
just want it to stop.

15:00.222 --> 15:02.357
You've decided you're the one
that's gonna stop it,

15:02.408 --> 15:03.792
and that's
a whole new ballgame.

15:03.859 --> 15:07.028
And in that game,
those are the rules.

15:20.009 --> 15:21.876
Alex.

15:21.927 --> 15:23.178

Apologize for the way

don't worry about it.

15:50.606 --> 15:52.106
It's fine.

15:52.174 --> 15:54.542
That is so not fine.

15:54.610 --> 15:55.960
Why did you ask Alex

15:56.045 --> 15:57.796
Because Alex

in a James Bond marathon,
Miss Moneypenny?

17:25.217 --> 17:26.968
Okay, that was a terrible

Mr. Scott?

Mr. Scott.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.581
I wrote it.

18:13.632 --> 18:15.516
I'd hoped <i>you</i>
<i>had the answer.</i>

18:15.584 --> 18:18.803
I'm not sure.

18:18.887 --> 18:20.238
Ms. Helbeck?

18:20.306 --> 18:22.173
By taking this class,
we've made an offer to you

18:22.241 --> 18:23.958
that you've accepted

18:24.026 --> 18:25.627
based on our facility
of intelligence,

18:25.694 --> 18:28.146
therefore setting the value
at a standard

18:28.230 --> 18:30.198
worth your time
and our money.

18:30.265 --> 18:33.651
And to violate the contract
is not only disappointing,

18:33.719 --> 18:36.321
but it makes your presence here
irritating.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.530
Uh, I'll be back in my office, 4:00.

18:53.427 --> 18:56.145
Professor Kellerman?

18:56.212 --> 18:59.214
You couldn't have given me
a couple classes to catch up?

18:59.266 --> 19:02.685
$97,795.

19:02.736 --> 19:03.903
What?

19:03.987 --> 19:07.740
$97,795, Mr. Scott.

19:07.824 --> 19:11.193
That's what a university spends,
on average, for each athlete.

19:11.244 --> 19:14.413
Non-athletic students
receive about $13,000

19:14.481 --> 19:15.931
in academic spending.

19:15.999 --> 19:18.200
On top of that, nearly every
school in the country

19:18.268 --> 19:20.519
operates their athletic programs
at a severe loss,

19:20.587 --> 19:23.238
including your very own
University of Maryland.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.007
Yes, I know who you are.

19:25.074 --> 19:28.511
I've been required to pass
marquee athletes for years.

19:28.578 --> 19:31.097
And I'll have to pass more
in the future.

19:31.181 --> 19:34.550
But I don't have to
pass you.

19:34.601 --> 19:36.802
You know, I had a choice
of professors.

19:36.887 --> 19:38.554
I chose this class.

19:42.592 --> 19:44.443
I intend to hold up my end
of the contract.

19:44.528 --> 19:46.562
I won't hold my breath.

19:54.621 --> 19:57.606
I don't think
there was anything on my list

19:57.657 --> 20:01.160
about squeezing two grown people
on an oversized toy.

20:01.244 --> 20:02.828
You wanted to ride
a motorcycle.

20:02.913 --> 20:06.215
I am quite certain that
that is not a motorcycle.

20:06.282 --> 20:08.501
Motorcycle
is a state of mind?

20:08.585 --> 20:11.504
It's all they'd let me rent
without a motorcycle license.

20:12.756 --> 20:14.306
Come on.
It's pretty fun, actually.

20:14.391 --> 20:16.475
It just feels like riding
a jet ski, but on land.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.795
Oh, it sounds much safer now,
thank you.

20:19.846 --> 20:21.630
Everyone in France rides one.
They're quite fashionable.

20:22.849 --> 20:24.433
Hop on, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

20:27.988 --> 20:30.806
Is this thing even legal
to take on the roads?

20:30.857 --> 20:32.307
Roads?

20:32.359 --> 20:34.493
Where we're going,
we don't need roads.

20:42.169 --> 20:43.619
Maybe we should
split the bar

20:43.670 --> 20:45.454
so we can each handle
our own fans.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.256

20:48.708 --> 20:50.125
Yeah, I'll have a ton
of people, too.

20:50.177 --> 20:52.294

a little competition out of it?

football-game throwdown.

What?

21:08.344 --> 21:10.946
Are you worried about us
becoming friends?

21:11.014 --> 21:13.616
No. I'm worried
you'll destroy my bar.

21:13.683 --> 21:16.035
Your terrible drinks
already did that.

21:16.119 --> 21:18.537
She's right.
Things can only improve.

You know, you should
probably stay away

21:37.757 --> 21:38.924
What's the matter?

21:39.009 --> 21:40.309
Well, my teacher
was mean to me today.

21:40.376 --> 21:41.594
Promise me
you'll stay away

21:41.678 --> 21:43.312
from anyone with "Keller"
in their name.

21:43.379 --> 21:47.516
Well, you could
pull a prank on him.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.319
Chuck has a really good one
with fire ants and honey.

21:52.022 --> 21:53.656
Thanks, Jame,
but, uh, I'm okay.

21:53.723 --> 21:55.991
I just --
I have to work harder

21:56.059 --> 21:58.444
to be better prepared
for this next class,

21:58.528 --> 22:00.863
and it's gonna be tough for me because
I have a lot of lists to memorize.

22:00.914 --> 22:03.032
And I've never really been good
at memorizing things.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.333
Lists are easy.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.701
I have
a really good trick.

22:05.752 --> 22:07.620
What's the list?

22:07.704 --> 22:10.238
Well, it's essential elements
of forming a contract.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.542
Offer, acceptance,

22:13.593 --> 22:17.479
consideration, facility,

22:17.547 --> 22:20.683
and intent to create
legal relations.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.217
Okay.

22:22.269 --> 22:25.804
O-a-c-f-I.

22:28.224 --> 22:31.593
Outside animals can't...

22:31.645 --> 22:33.445
Fart inside.

22:35.231 --> 22:37.983
So, if you just remember that,
you'll always remember the list.

22:38.068 --> 22:40.869
All right.

22:40.937 --> 22:44.156
First tutor girl,
now tutor son.

22:48.878 --> 22:50.496
Haley.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.915
Ah, there you are.

22:52.966 --> 22:54.333
Wow.
This is amazing.

22:54.417 --> 22:56.118
Thanks so much
for inviting me.

22:56.169 --> 22:57.803
I love kid Cudi.

22:57.887 --> 22:59.722
Good, 'cause you're
about to meet him.

22:59.789 --> 23:01.557
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

23:01.624 --> 23:03.759
Hi. Sorry to interrupt, guys.
Hey, Scott.

23:03.810 --> 23:05.811
I just wanted to introduce you
to Erin.

23:05.895 --> 23:07.429
Erin Macree,
this is kid Cudi.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.647
It's so nice to meet you.

23:08.732 --> 23:10.182
Can I just say --
I love your stuff.

23:10.266 --> 23:11.466
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

23:11.518 --> 23:13.102
From what I heard,
you might be the one

23:13.153 --> 23:14.803
everyone leaves here
talking about tonight.

23:14.854 --> 23:16.188
I'm sorry?

23:16.272 --> 23:18.140
Well, if you're half as good
as what Haley's been saying,

23:18.191 --> 23:19.274
you're gonna be a tough act
to follow.

23:20.243 --> 23:21.643
I'm opening?

23:21.695 --> 23:23.112
You're opening, yes.

23:23.163 --> 23:24.780
And I'm really looking forward
to hearing your stuff.

23:24.831 --> 23:25.998
It's gonna be
a great night.

23:26.082 --> 23:27.950
Okay, so,
we'll leave you alone to relax.

23:28.001 --> 23:29.368
Let me know
if you need anything.

23:29.452 --> 23:30.536
Cool.
Sounds good.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.320
Good meeting you, Erin.

23:33.990 --> 23:35.374
Oh, my gosh.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.826
I can't believe you're letting
me open for kid Cudi tonight.

23:37.877 --> 23:39.128
How do I ever thank you?

23:39.179 --> 23:40.462
Don't thank me.
Thank Mia.

23:40.513 --> 23:42.164
This was all
her little brainchild.

23:42.215 --> 23:43.331
Now, don't be nervous.

23:43.383 --> 23:45.100
All you have to do
is remember to play.

23:45.168 --> 23:46.501
Don't think about --
nervous?

23:46.553 --> 23:49.438
No way.
I'm gonna kill this.

23:50.890 --> 23:53.859
So, how are you
gonna kill her?

24:01.184 --> 24:02.901
That's cute.

24:04.854 --> 24:07.906
You're gonna need
an untraceable gun.

24:07.991 --> 24:10.209
Contrary to what you've seen
in films,

24:10.293 --> 24:11.660
you're gonna have to get in
nice and close.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.245
In fact, the only reason
you're still alive

24:13.329 --> 24:15.814
is that she shot you
from across the room.

24:15.882 --> 24:17.549
Mm.

24:20.887 --> 24:24.139
So...

24:24.207 --> 24:25.808
If you're not
close enough

24:25.875 --> 24:28.010
to feel the blood splatter
on your face...

24:33.066 --> 24:35.217
...Then you're not
close enough.

24:38.571 --> 24:41.023
I suggest the heart.

24:41.074 --> 24:44.777
Head's too messy.

24:44.861 --> 24:47.196
You're just trying
to scare me.

24:47.247 --> 24:49.731
Scare you? No.

24:49.783 --> 24:52.418
I'm just trying to prepare you
the best that I can.

24:52.502 --> 24:55.287
'Cause watching the light go out
in someone's eyes

24:55.371 --> 24:57.623
and knowing you're the one
that took it,

24:57.690 --> 24:59.992
that's something
that'll never leave you.

25:00.059 --> 25:02.344
And just remember this --

25:02.411 --> 25:04.412
the moment you pull
that trigger,

25:04.464 --> 25:06.381
you'll never
be the same again.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.917
For the rest of your life,
it'll be there...

25:08.968 --> 25:10.936
With every breath.

25:11.020 --> 25:13.421
Are you ready for that?

25:22.315 --> 25:25.033
Whoo.
Absolutely not!

25:25.101 --> 25:27.236
But it was on your list!
You've always wanted to do it!

25:27.287 --> 25:30.789
I changed my mind!
A girl can change her mind!

25:30.874 --> 25:32.124
Okay, now's the time.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.542
You guys ready?
No.

25:33.609 --> 25:35.077
Give us
just one minute here.

25:35.128 --> 25:36.462
I promise you it'll be

25:36.546 --> 25:38.964
the second-most exhilarating
45 seconds of your life.

25:39.048 --> 25:40.115
What's the first?

25:40.166 --> 25:42.117
Oh, a sex joke,

25:42.168 --> 25:45.137
which might be cute if we
weren't 15,000 feet in the air

25:45.221 --> 25:47.256
with a quarter of the plane
missing!

25:47.307 --> 25:50.625
Brooke, life is not
which breaths you take when --

25:50.677 --> 25:51.810
wait, wait, wait.

25:51.895 --> 25:53.979
Life is not about taking
the breaths that --

25:54.063 --> 25:54.796
what?

25:54.848 --> 25:56.131
Hold on!

25:56.182 --> 25:57.299
We're gonna miss
our window.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.101
It's okay.

25:59.152 --> 26:01.436
"Life is not measured by
the number of breaths we take,

26:01.488 --> 26:04.606
but by the moments
that take our breath away."

26:04.657 --> 26:06.975
Did you seriously
just quote "hitch"?

26:07.026 --> 26:08.994
Yeah, because it's
a really great quote.

26:09.078 --> 26:12.531
Life is about
breathtaking moments like this.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.166
Let's take the plunge.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.285
It's now or never, guys.

26:16.336 --> 26:18.670
Fine!

26:18.755 --> 26:21.673
Now, before I change
my mind.

Coming at you.

Oh.

27:59.956 --> 28:01.039
Watch out, little guy.

28:01.123 --> 28:02.991
You might want to stay clear
of the bar

28:03.042 --> 28:04.826
so you don't
hurt yourself, Chase.

Very nice.

28:20.543 --> 28:21.810
It's a negative net worth.

28:31.621 --> 28:33.455
but due to
budgetary restrictions,

28:33.522 --> 28:35.857
I thought maybe I could
bring the moon to you.

28:35.908 --> 28:37.742
It's beautiful.

28:37.827 --> 28:38.960

it was possible.

28:52.308 --> 28:53.508

No, I'm pretty sure it was on --

No.

Don't. Just --

30:56.665 --> 30:58.049
Does he know about this?

30:58.134 --> 30:59.984
I think we should tell him,
don't you?

31:00.052 --> 31:01.553
Please just give me
my phone.

31:01.637 --> 31:03.671

he'd be happy to hear the plan.

31:03.723 --> 31:06.524
Hello?

31:06.609 --> 31:08.059
Please don't.
Hey, Quinn?

Hello?

31:13.315 --> 31:14.733
Hello, Quinn?

31:16.018 --> 31:17.869
Hi, honey.

31:17.953 --> 31:21.689
No, sorry. Uh, the reception
is horrible here.

31:21.741 --> 31:23.992

Taylor says hi.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.195
I'm okay.

31:27.246 --> 31:29.147
It just, uh...

31:31.967 --> 31:33.501
It's just been
an emotional day.

31:33.552 --> 31:37.172
But, um, can I --
can I call you later on tonight?

31:38.908 --> 31:40.425
I love you, too.

31:50.970 --> 31:52.687

31:52.738 --> 31:55.990
from everyone

31:58.393 --> 32:00.394

What a great job.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.821
We actually had to
turn people some away, you know.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.574

you're fishing for, Mr. Baker,

36:18.810 --> 36:20.695
fish no more.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.949
I'm sorry I've been
so up and down lately.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.985
They say the only thing
that's worse than being poor

36:28.037 --> 36:29.754
is being rich
and then poor.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.507
And I certainly
haven't handled it well.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.958
They?

36:34.009 --> 36:35.760
Mm-hmm.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.663
You know, the people that say
those kinds of things.

36:41.717 --> 36:43.468
They would probably
also say

36:43.519 --> 36:46.137
that I'm still richer
than I've ever been...

36:46.188 --> 36:49.607
Because no matter how much money
I have in my bank account,

36:49.675 --> 36:52.060
I know that my dreams
can still come true

36:52.144 --> 36:53.394
because I'm with you.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.113
That's my girl.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.115
And it didn't even come
from "Hitch."

36:59.401 --> 37:01.703
You should know that...

37:01.787 --> 37:04.956

even the last one
on that list.

37:08.877 --> 37:10.361
Which one's that?

37:10.412 --> 37:13.798
I <i>will</i> give you a baby,
