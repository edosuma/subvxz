It's just...

00:56.090 --> 00:57.355
I don't want to
bring it up again.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.957
But you will.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.693
It's just if we all
practiced more,

01:01.829 --> 01:04.963
Like I said,
we would have won.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.766
That rochester team played
like a finely tuned machine.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.702
We all have busy lives,
miss cherry.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.838
Yes. But one can
always make time.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.907
What about
the at-home exercises?

01:15.042 --> 01:18.110
The finger press,
the arm lifts.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.712
Volleyball is not
cut-throat competition.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.648
-I thought you wanted to win.
-I do.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.449
But it's also
supposed to be fun.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.118
You know what's fun?
Winning is fun.

01:27.154 --> 01:31.123
What about you?
Did you do the exercises?

01:31.125 --> 01:33.191
No, I'm afraid
I didn't do any.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.993
You had the time.
You're not working right now.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.797
You did wonderfully.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.533
Wonderful job of letting
the ball hit the ground.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.802
Miss cherry!
That is quite enough.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.804
Now then, ladies,
what's all this?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.607
Someone on the team doesn't
believe in losing graciously.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.176
I assume, miss cherry,
that that someone is you?

01:51.311 --> 01:53.678
If wanting to win
is a crime then, yes,

01:53.714 --> 01:55.346
Guilty as charged.

I think you've said your piece.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.920
When we're back in toronto

02:01.989 --> 02:03.888
We can talk about
scheduling practices.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.424
But, in the meantime,
who would like a cup of tea?

02:06.460 --> 02:07.425
I would love one.

Take no notice
of miss cherry.

I thought you did
a cracking job out there.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.714
Thank you, inspector,
but I know that I need

02:28.716 --> 02:29.981
A great deal more practice.

This man has
a nasty gash on his head.

Mr. Adams, can you go
and get my medical bag?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.155
Ask for mrs. Hart,
she should have it.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.289
Yes, ma'am.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.558
Inspector,
can you gather some napkins?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.159
And we need water.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.694
What happened?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
Just stay
very still, effie.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.034
Here. Relax.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.105
Oh, thank you.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.906
That cut on your brow.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.775
It won't need stitches,
but I can see that

05:43.844 --> 05:45.042
You're favouring
your side.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.111
I'm fine. I'm fine.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.379
Did you hit it
when you went down?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.114
Caught it on
the edge of the bar.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.382
Wouldn't be
the first time.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.050
I just think
I've bruised my side.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.652
Well, I need to
take care of effie,

05:53.787 --> 05:55.120
But then I want to
look at that bruise.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.321
It can wait.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.922
Look, I'm going to have
a look in the engine car,

05:57.958 --> 05:58.990
See what happened.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.193
If anybody's injured,
I'll come and find you.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.395
Oh, thank you!

06:03.530 --> 06:05.029
Effie.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.631
Effie?

06:06.633 --> 06:07.866
I'm going to
give you some laudanum.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.202
It will help
with the pain.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.007
Inspector brackenreid,
toronto constabulary.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.409
Can you tell me
what happened?

06:17.544 --> 06:18.810
Damned if I know.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.879
I went to slow the train
coming into that curve,

06:20.881 --> 06:23.615
But the brakes
didn't react.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.883
The brakes failed?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.485
Exactly.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.687
Were you alone
in the engine car?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.821
Yes.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.356
The fireman should have
been with me, but...

06:33.260 --> 06:35.493
There he is. Pinsky!

06:35.495 --> 06:37.062
Where the hell
were you?

06:37.197 --> 06:39.197
I was in the privy.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.465
The privy?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.400
Tell me more
about the brakes.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.637
Well, I had a look
and the only way I figure it

06:46.673 --> 06:49.241
Is at least one of the angle
cocks on the brake valve

06:49.376 --> 06:50.709
Was turned off.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.977
Brackenreid:
How does that happen?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.244
Somebody
turns them off.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.847
Are you saying that someone
did this deliberately?

06:55.982 --> 06:58.650
Looks that way to me.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.729
Henry?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.599
Oh, sir. I wasn't expecting
you here on a Sunday.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.067
Ah, yes.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.336
I'm here to work
on my ground-controlled

07:18.338 --> 07:20.672
Aerial
surveillance camera.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.608
Have you brought
your daughter to work?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.009
Higgins:
I had to, sir.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.745
Ruth is celebrating a new
holiday called mother's day.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.714
Apparently,
it's all the rage in america.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.216
A day solely to
celebrate mothers.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.285
Lovely idea.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.552
It's not just that.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.754
According to ruth,
it's a day where mothers

07:36.790 --> 07:38.156
Can do whatever
they please.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.024
Without their children.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.294
Yes, she has quite the busy
day with her friends planned,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.829
Doing whatever
it is they do.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.898
And Sunday is
the nanny's day off, so--

07:46.967 --> 07:49.100
-I see.
-Yes.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.770
Well, that's
enough of that.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.572
Ah, come on.
There we go.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.973
Yep.
There we go.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.375
But, sir, I assure you
I'm just on desk duty today,

07:57.444 --> 07:58.844
So it's going
to be fine.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.779
You won't even
know we're here.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.448
Newsstand robbery
at king and portland.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.982
We have to go.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.584
There's no one else?

08:08.121 --> 08:12.823
Uh, well, how would you like to
take a little walk then, hm?

08:14.328 --> 08:17.395
Henry, you can't bring
a baby to a crime scene.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.465
Well, it's
a newsstand robbery, sir.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.667
Nevertheless.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.202
Ah, of course.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.172
Ah, detective watts,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.273
Perhaps you could
watch jordan?

08:29.309 --> 08:30.474
Just for a little while.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.743
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have plans.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.911
I'm only here
waiting for a friend.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.681
Well, it can't be
too dangerous.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.316
The robbery has
already happened.

08:38.385 --> 08:42.554
Oh, henry,
I'll watch baby jordan.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.155
Thank you, sir!

08:44.291 --> 08:47.492
I promise she'll probably sleep
the whole time I'm gone.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.827
You won't even
notice she's here.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.708
Cherry:
How is she?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.811
I've given her
some laudanum.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.246
It should help with the pain
and get her to rest.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.116
Is her leg
badly damaged?

09:11.118 --> 09:14.185
No lacerations,
but possibly a fractured tibia.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.321
Her pulse is
strong, though.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.356
She looks so pale.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.924
Ogden:
Yes.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.426
I can't treat her properly
until we get to a hospital.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.864
Could we send a party ahead to
the train station to get help?

09:25.866 --> 09:29.267
They'll know something's wrong,
they're expecting the train.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.735
They'll send people.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.737
They'd better hurry.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.474
Just stay with her.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.877
If she wakes up,
give her three drops of laudanum

09:39.012 --> 09:40.278
In a glass of water.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.623
You haven't
heard of this?

09:51.625 --> 09:52.557
No.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.492
Oh, it's in all
the books for tourists.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.495
Meu postilhao foi
atingido por um raio.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.830
And in english?

09:58.965 --> 10:01.232
My postillion has been
struck by lightning.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.567
Oh, wonderful.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.969
I'm sure one would need to
say that every day in portugal.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.170
We should go there.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.506
Portugal is only about
a week's boat ride away.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.174
Llewelyn, I--

10:10.210 --> 10:11.309
Make up an excuse.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.444
You have a dear
old uncle in porto

10:13.480 --> 10:15.847
And you must see him
before he dies.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.115
I couldn't.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.316
Well, then at least
let's go to my place.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.585
No, we're going
to the track.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.122
You don't know what it's
like with a baby at home.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.591
I love samuel,
but I need a break.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.197
I haven't placed
a bet since 1902

10:32.199 --> 10:33.931
When I lost every penny I had.

10:33.933 --> 10:37.601
Well, then today you can lose
your money buying us drinks.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.070
As you wish.

10:39.205 --> 10:41.472
Now, how many
horses are there?

10:45.612 --> 10:46.744
Mrs. Hart.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.547
How are miss newsome
and inspector brackenreid?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.150
The inspector's
as stubborn as ever.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.018
He refused
an examination.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.221
But I'm worried
about effie.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.023
Her leg was badly
injured in the crash.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.491
Will she be all right?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.827
We'll see.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.562
Oh, this is
mrs. Dooley.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.431
I've cleaned
and dressed her wounds.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.466
The porter found
the first aid kit for me.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.835
It looks good.
You did well.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.705
It's a lot different
working on live bodies.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.473
Excuse me?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.675
Oh, I'm a coroner.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.910
Well, you're a little early
to the party, aren't you?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.548
Dr. Ogden,
could I have a word?

11:23.617 --> 11:24.849
Did you find
out anything?

11:24.984 --> 11:26.317
I spoke to
the engineer.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.119
He said the brakes were
checked at the last station.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.321
They were in perfect order.
Now they're not.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.190
Someone tampered
with them?

11:32.325 --> 11:33.691
He thinks so.

11:33.727 --> 11:34.925
But if the brakes
were in order

11:34.961 --> 11:36.127
When we left
the last station

11:36.262 --> 11:38.529
Then whoever tampered
with them was on this train?

11:38.598 --> 11:40.398
Who'd derail a train
that they were traveling on?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.833
It's too dangerous!
It doesn't make any sense.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.738
Just checking on people, seeing
if they're doing all right.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.339
Luckily, I'm a doctor

11:48.475 --> 11:50.541
And we have the coroner
on board, as well.

11:50.676 --> 11:53.210
Oh, hopefully his
services won't be needed.

11:53.246 --> 11:57.348
Her services and, yes,
I think we've escaped that just.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.051
Right. How about the people
in the cargo car?

12:00.186 --> 12:01.752
Who's in there?

12:01.754 --> 12:04.021
A toronto policeman
travelling with another man.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.090
They wanted to sit
by themselves.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.692
In the cargo car? Why?

12:07.827 --> 12:09.894
I don't know.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.596
Let's have a look.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.979
Bloody hell.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.385
I don't have
to ask, do I?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.320
No.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.925
You don't need to
ask how, either.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.127
Look at the handcuffs.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.963
I'm guessing
the prisoner killed him.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.366
And now he's
on the run.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.281
It's curious.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.784
It appears the killer
tore off his suspenders.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.685
You'd have
thought he'd taken

13:07.687 --> 13:10.354
His jacket and cap
as a disguise.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.189
This must be
his satchel.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.892
The shard went
through the jugular.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.627
He would have
died very quickly.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.529
Poor bastard.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.365
Walter rydell.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.033
It seems he was
escorting a prisoner

13:23.069 --> 13:24.302
By the name of ben miller

13:24.304 --> 13:26.571
From rochester jail
to toronto.

13:26.706 --> 13:29.440
Do you think this ben miller
took advantage of the crash,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.775
Killed his escort
and then made his escape?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.545
Or he killed him first,

13:33.680 --> 13:35.646
Then he derailed
the train as a diversion,

13:35.715 --> 13:36.981
Then he made his escape.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.318
[baby laughs]

13:50.730 --> 13:53.130
I have work to do,
baby jordan.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.615
What we need is a safe,
contained area

14:10.684 --> 14:12.850
For you to play in.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.020
Hm.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.290
How is she?

14:19.326 --> 14:22.426
She woke up in pain,
so I gave her more laudanum.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.161
Is there anything
else I can do?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.732
Just stay with her.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.833
If the leg starts to swell,
let me know.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.636
The two passengers nearest
the cargo car door,

14:32.672 --> 14:34.839
They didn't even know
there was anyone in there.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.475
They didn't see anyone go in
or out before the crash.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.410
Well, if they're correct,
then ben miller

14:39.479 --> 14:41.112
Didn't leave
to tamper with the brakes.

14:41.247 --> 14:44.181
And if ben miller
didn't derail the train...

14:44.251 --> 14:45.917
He had an accomplice.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.854
Pinsky. I want a word.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.756
Exactly where were you
when the train derailed?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.126
Why do you
want to know?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.394
I was talking to
your engineer.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.529
He said you left your post
just before the crash.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.197
That seems a bit
suspicious to me.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.667
Ah, like I said,
I was in the privy.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.070
Where are the angle cock valves
that you were telling me about?

15:06.205 --> 15:08.706
I've been checking the valves
and the only ones turned off

15:08.742 --> 15:10.475
Were at the back
of the engine car.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.410
-And?
-I wasn't there.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.080
I'll ask around,
see if anyone saw you there.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.615
You would have had
to pass that valve

15:17.684 --> 15:18.616
To get to where
you were going.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.417
Sure, I suppose.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.020
Do you know a man
named ben miller?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.022
No. No.
Who's that?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.556
That's the man
that the constable

15:25.558 --> 15:27.025
Was bringing
to toronto.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.426
They were in
the cargo car.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.461
No, I swear to you,
I have no idea who that is.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.697
Do I need to talk
to your engineer?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.435
All right.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.438
I may as well
tell you now.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.073
I was in jail five years ago
for petty theft,

15:42.142 --> 15:43.441
But now I got a wife
and a child,

15:43.443 --> 15:46.043
And I wouldn't risk that life
I've built for anything.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.246
I'm looking for
an escaped convict.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.647
Are you going to
help me or not?

15:52.218 --> 15:53.651
I may have seen the man
you're looking for

15:53.653 --> 15:54.852
After the derailment.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.321
I'm listening.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.457
After I was done checking
the valves, I saw someone.

15:59.592 --> 16:00.892
He was on the other
side of the train.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.326
[groans]

16:02.362 --> 16:04.261
-Are you all right?
-Never mind me. Never mind.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.931
Did you get
a good look at him?

16:06.933 --> 16:08.333
No, I didn't
see his face.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.735
I just saw his tall,
brown boots.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.236
Show me where
you saw him.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.742
So, he was
standing about here.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.611
Then he went off
in that direction.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.750
What's that?

16:29.355 --> 16:32.557
It's blood.
Was the man you saw bleeding?

16:32.559 --> 16:34.158
I don't know.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.302
Blood leads
to the door.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.705
If that's ben miller,
he got back on the train.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.041
[grunts]

16:50.110 --> 16:53.444
Right.
Here we are.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.050
Perfect little spot
for baby jordan, huh?

17:13.199 --> 17:15.132
Oh! I know!

17:15.201 --> 17:17.268
You must be hungry.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.672
Would you like...

17:23.043 --> 17:25.343
Hmm. Uh...

17:27.347 --> 17:29.013
What about...

17:29.148 --> 17:30.714
Some milk?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.152
No?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.287
Um.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.692
Now this is
a book I wrote.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.360
I have several
copies left over.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.828
Perhaps you...

17:44.864 --> 17:46.831
No. Perhaps not.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.436
What about this?

17:55.241 --> 17:56.107
I know.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.509
Uh... Wait right here.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.649
Watch it!

18:04.784 --> 18:06.584
I've given you
seven stitches.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.386
Don't put any
pressure on the leg,

18:08.388 --> 18:09.787
They'll open up.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.122
You're tying it
too tight.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.925
Look, I'm a coroner,
not a doctor.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.492
But I'm the best
you've got right now.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.197
Now, have a seat
if you'd like,

18:19.199 --> 18:20.598
But stay off it
as best you can.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.665
Fine.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.879
Violet, how are you?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.080
Better now that
I've seen to everyone.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.417
How does it feel to
stitch up living people?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.018
It took some
getting used to.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.154
I stitched up a man's
wound fairly well.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.688
It would have been
more serious,

18:44.757 --> 18:47.024
But he tied suspenders
above the wound.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.693
Suspenders?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.494
Were they his own?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.164
I'm not sure.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.368
Could you find
the inspector, please?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.369
Tell him
to come here quickly.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.138
I'll be right back.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.581
Hello, baby jordan!

19:10.617 --> 19:12.249
I can see you.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.321
Well, I think
I've done it.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.856
With the help
of this device,

19:18.991 --> 19:20.858
I'll be able to
control the drone,

19:20.927 --> 19:23.994
Which will be buoyed
by large balloons

19:24.063 --> 19:27.265
And fans will help
control the direction

19:27.267 --> 19:29.066
So I'm able to
take a photograph

19:29.068 --> 19:31.669
From exactly where I want.

19:31.738 --> 19:35.806
But, first, I have to
inflate the balloons.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.823
Mrs. Hart said you
wanted to see me.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.892
There's a man on this car
with a gash on his leg.

19:55.929 --> 19:59.497
He used these suspenders
as a tourniquet.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.432
Suspenders.
Which man?

20:01.434 --> 20:04.769
There, with the hat
over his eyes.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.504
[brackenreid sighs]

20:07.540 --> 20:09.506
Are you all right?
You look very pale.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.041
I'm fine.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.778
The fireman just told
me that he saw a man

20:13.913 --> 20:15.246
Get off the train
after the derailment,

20:15.381 --> 20:16.781
Who then got back on.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.183
He was bleeding.

20:19.318 --> 20:23.120
He must have been wounded,
then taken rydell's suspenders

20:23.189 --> 20:24.921
To staunch the bleeding.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.890
That's him.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.061
Excuse me, sir.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.395
Are you ben miller?

20:32.598 --> 20:33.797
Ah, come back here!

20:36.002 --> 20:37.367
Oi! I said stop!

20:39.038 --> 20:41.505
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me!

20:44.677 --> 20:47.377
Thomas! Thomas!

20:59.025 --> 21:00.557
Thomas!

21:00.593 --> 21:02.492
Get his shirt open, now.

21:02.528 --> 21:03.694
Did miller do this?

21:03.829 --> 21:05.262
Ogden: I think he sustained
an injury in the crash.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.531
His pulse is very weak.
Check his left side.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.034
There's a large
discolouration.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.468
It's likely
internal bleeding.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.536
An organ rupture?

21:12.538 --> 21:14.238
We don't know.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.706
We'll have to operate.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.109
-Anything I can do?
-Find the porter.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.278
We need towels and hot water,
as much as he can muster.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.814
First, help us get him up
onto some of these crates.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.187
Jordan? Jordan!

21:30.323 --> 21:32.456
Baby jordan!

21:32.458 --> 21:33.990
Jordan?

21:36.729 --> 21:37.861
Jordan!

21:42.135 --> 21:43.334
[baby babbles]

21:46.005 --> 21:47.704
What are you...

21:52.411 --> 21:53.543
How did you...

21:57.250 --> 21:59.016
Murray marble's
two mover!

21:59.151 --> 22:00.618
I've had the pieces
set up for weeks

22:00.753 --> 22:02.686
And I can't solve it.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.555
You are one
troublesome baby.

22:06.259 --> 22:07.924
Very sweet,
but troublesome.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.628
I have a boatload
of work left to do

22:11.698 --> 22:13.797
And I can't take my eyes
off of you for one second.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.302
I could...

22:19.339 --> 22:21.805
Ooh. That's too drastic.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.709
It could work.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.249
There you are.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.585
I'm going to go
do a bit of work.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.787
Why don't you
have a nap?

22:36.922 --> 22:38.588
Or play with your doll?

22:38.624 --> 22:40.057
Very good.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.594
Uh...

22:48.667 --> 22:49.966
Hopefully she won't
remember this.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.470
Keep absorbing
the blood, violet.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.672
I'm trying.
There's so much.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.876
I was worried it was collecting
in the peritoneal cavity,

22:58.945 --> 23:00.477
But it doesn't seem
to be the case.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.613
Are the spleen
or colon ruptured?

23:02.748 --> 23:04.415
-They're intact.
-That's a relief.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.751
But I still can't find
the burst blood vessel.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.020
I'm running out
of towels.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.826
Put your hand there.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.230
I can't see where
the blood is coming from.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.334
Keep steady, violet.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.574
How're you feeling?

23:30.709 --> 23:31.975
I'm scared.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.911
My leg hurts so badly.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.645
What if I can't
walk again?

23:35.681 --> 23:37.314
You'll be fine.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.648
How do you know?

23:38.684 --> 23:42.252
Because dr. Ogden said
that you'll heal in no time.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.722
Why are you being
so nice to me?

23:45.758 --> 23:48.259
I'm just trying
to make sweet

23:48.261 --> 23:49.593
So I can get
an exclusive interview

23:49.728 --> 23:51.262
About your kidnapping.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.396
That was
six months ago.

23:52.531 --> 23:53.931
Did you have
to bring that up?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.066
Sorry.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.003
Bad attempt at a joke.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.472
You probably think
I should be over it by now.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.608
Nonsense.

24:04.743 --> 24:05.876
You were kidnapped,

24:05.945 --> 24:07.611
It's going to
take time to heal.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.613
Please change
the subject.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.451
Do you and george
plan to get married?

24:17.723 --> 24:19.422
I don't know.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.226
Every time I look at george,
I remember what happened.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.228
He had nothing
to do with it.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.698
I know, but they are
still out there.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.300
Perhaps it would be best
for george and I

24:30.369 --> 24:31.702
If we never marry.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.904
And let them win?

24:33.940 --> 24:36.239
You're better
than that.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.309
You two will
find a way.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.043
Careful.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.580
I'm going to tell people
you have a heart.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.448
Now you've
gone too far.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.051
[groans]

24:47.186 --> 24:48.318
I need some more...

24:48.387 --> 24:50.054
More of the...

24:50.189 --> 24:51.989
You've had two
doses already.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.991
Dr. Ogden says that you
should have plain water.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.333
Two drops.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.607
I'm almost finished
the exterior incision.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.143
Are you sure the blood
vessel stitches will hold?

25:13.278 --> 25:15.178
As sure as I can be.

25:18.551 --> 25:19.883
Are you feeling
all right?

25:19.952 --> 25:21.752
Yes. Why?

25:21.887 --> 25:24.554
Your hands are
shaking a little.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.890
I haven't had anything
to eat or drink today.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.093
It must be
catching up with me.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.162
Well, I've finished
the stitching.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.664
Just need to clean
the area one more time.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.302
If you don't need me anymore,
I'm going to get some air.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.737
Of course.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.746
[sobs]

25:52.919 --> 25:54.918
[deep breathing]

26:12.271 --> 26:15.138
Where is my screwdriver?

26:20.446 --> 26:21.345
[distant baby crying]

26:21.480 --> 26:22.880
Jordan.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.616
Oh. Uh.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.419
Oh! Oh, baby jordan.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.888
What is it?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.557
Oh! Oh!

26:36.462 --> 26:38.362
It's all right.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.496
Huh.

26:39.532 --> 26:41.632
My goodness.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.101
Where is your doll?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.637
What have you done
with your...

26:46.772 --> 26:47.871
Huh.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.339
Right here.

26:52.044 --> 26:56.580
How on earth did
you get this

26:56.715 --> 26:58.381
All the way under...

27:02.989 --> 27:05.255
Oh.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.257
Uh, jordan.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.593
What have you done?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.264
Huh, jordan.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.466
The keys.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.302
Get the keys.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.205
Yes. Yes!

27:21.207 --> 27:23.540
Oh! Very good. Yes!

27:23.609 --> 27:24.941
Yes!

27:24.977 --> 27:27.578
Bring the keys to me.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.479
Jordan.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.248
Jordan, please?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.416
Please, no, come back.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.217
No, no! Jordan!

27:34.286 --> 27:35.552
Come back!

27:35.554 --> 27:36.687
The keys, jordan!

27:36.822 --> 27:39.356
Jordan! Come back!

27:39.358 --> 27:41.091
Hello!

27:41.127 --> 27:42.626
Help! Someone!

27:42.628 --> 27:43.793
Help!

27:48.634 --> 27:50.767
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

27:50.803 --> 27:52.102
Yes, ma'am.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.771
I've been knocking at this
lavatory door for ten minutes.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.372
Did you see anyone
go in there?

27:56.409 --> 27:58.375
No, but the door
is locked.

28:01.714 --> 28:04.581
Is anyone in there? Hello?

28:04.650 --> 28:06.583
Is anyone in there?

28:07.853 --> 28:09.419
[screams]

28:09.455 --> 28:10.653
What's wrong?

28:12.058 --> 28:13.190
Mr. Adams,
get the door open!

28:19.165 --> 28:20.296
[gasps]

28:29.842 --> 28:31.074
Dooley:
Is he dead?

28:31.077 --> 28:32.543
I think I should leave him
in here and lock the door

28:32.678 --> 28:33.610
And we can wait--

28:33.646 --> 28:34.677
Mr. Adams.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.213
Let me through, please.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.681
-We should leave him be.
-Just a minute!

28:39.385 --> 28:40.550
One large cut
to the throat...

28:42.755 --> 28:44.087
Severing the left
carotid artery.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.023
I'm not seeing any
defensive wounds.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.225
Might have been forced into
the lavatory and then murdered.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.693
I'm going to lock
the door now, ladies,

28:49.828 --> 28:51.361
And we can wait
for the authorities.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.897
Mr. Adams, for all
intents and purposes,

28:53.966 --> 28:55.432
Right now we are
the authorities.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.701
So, please, just stand
back and let us work.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.068
If you insist.

29:00.773 --> 29:01.838
Found this
in the pocket.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.910
Ogden:
We found this on ben miller.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.912
It's his transfer paper
from the rochester jail.

29:08.914 --> 29:12.182
He was released into
the custody of mr. Rydell,

29:12.184 --> 29:14.717
To be a witness
in a court case.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.987
-Well, we were wrong.
-About what?

29:17.056 --> 29:19.122
Whoever derailed
the train.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.723
We thought it was someone
on miller's side,

29:20.760 --> 29:22.993
An accomplice
helping him escape.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.061
So why would this
person kill him?

29:25.131 --> 29:27.063
To stop him from
testifying, perhaps?

29:27.199 --> 29:30.267
Or protecting themselves
or save whomever's on trial.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.069
Whatever the reason,
there's a killer on the loose.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.612
[sighs]

29:44.416 --> 29:46.283
-Sir?
-Henry!

29:46.352 --> 29:47.417
What's going on?

29:47.419 --> 29:48.585
Let me out!

29:49.688 --> 29:51.287
How did you get locked
in the cell, sir?

29:51.323 --> 29:52.556
I can explain!

29:52.558 --> 29:57.027
Well, first I had baby
jordan locked in the cell.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.563
You put my baby
daughter in jail?

29:59.565 --> 30:00.664
What did she do?

30:00.799 --> 30:03.032
Oh, no. No, henry! No.

30:03.068 --> 30:06.503
I was outside working on my
aerial surveillance camera--

30:06.505 --> 30:07.638
I can't believe
you'd put a baby in jail.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.239
My baby in jail!

30:09.241 --> 30:10.974
Well, she's quite
the little escape artist.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.445
Well, where is she now?

30:15.581 --> 30:18.114
She escaped.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.583
What?

30:19.585 --> 30:21.584
You've lost my daughter?

30:23.255 --> 30:24.988
Jordan!

30:25.024 --> 30:26.122
Jordan.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.892
Jordan! Jordan?

30:33.699 --> 30:36.733
-Henry! Henry!
-What is it?

30:36.869 --> 30:38.669
I left the nipkow disk running.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.737
It may have recorded
which way jordan went.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.072
Well, hurry!
We have to find her.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.411
Should be somewhere
around here.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.548
That was her!
She crawled past your office.

30:52.585 --> 30:56.052
Looks like she was headed
toward the front door.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.688
Where is she?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.426
Uh...

31:03.662 --> 31:04.560
Do you see her?
She can't have gotten very far.

31:04.597 --> 31:07.697
Henry, there's
a possibility--

31:07.733 --> 31:09.099
A possibility of what?

31:09.234 --> 31:12.102
A possibility
she may be up.

31:12.237 --> 31:15.304
What?
Well get her down!

31:15.306 --> 31:16.973
Well, I can't
find the remote--

31:17.042 --> 31:19.509
Get her down now!
My baby's up there!

31:22.814 --> 31:24.147
Do you think
miller knew

31:24.183 --> 31:25.748
Someone on the train
wanted to kill him?

31:25.784 --> 31:28.551
Probably not, or he would
have taken his chances escaping,

31:28.621 --> 31:30.720
Even with a serious injury.

31:30.789 --> 31:32.456
I've been around
the train again.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.257
I'm fairly certain
there's no one missing.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.794
So whoever killed miller
is still on this train.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.197
Let's keep close together.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.666
I'm going to check
on the inspector.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.801
I just said we should
stay close together!

31:44.803 --> 31:46.937
I can look
after myself.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.404
Thank you,
mrs. Hart.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.877
Oh, mr. Adams, did you see
anyone near the lavatory

31:54.914 --> 31:56.879
Before we found
ben miller?

31:56.916 --> 31:58.214
Adams:
No, I didn't.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.083
Though I've been wondering
about that fireman

32:00.152 --> 32:01.418
Being in the area.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.220
-Fireman?
-Mr. Pinsky.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.155
Your friend, the inspector,
talked with him a few times.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.358
I think with
some suspicion.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.860
Is that so?

32:09.995 --> 32:11.894
Did you know mr. Pinsky
is an ex-convict?

32:11.931 --> 32:14.630
No, I haven't
spoken with him.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.033
I don't know about
his personal life,

32:16.168 --> 32:19.535
But maybe he still has one
foot in the criminal world.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.973
-Mr. Pinsky?
-That's me.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.709
I'm dr. Ogden,
travelling with the inspector.

32:25.778 --> 32:29.245
May I ask where you've been
since you spoke with him last?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.948
Oh, you think I had anything
to do with that man found dead.

32:31.984 --> 32:35.118
Just answer the question,
mr. Pinsky.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.053
I already spoke to
your inspector

32:37.122 --> 32:39.188
And I'm going to tell you
what I told him:

32:39.224 --> 32:42.258
I had nothing to do with
that train derailing

32:42.328 --> 32:44.927
And I certainly had
nothing to do any murder.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.797
I never heard of
any ben miller before today.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.966
You haven't answered
the question.

32:50.002 --> 32:52.702
I was outside,
smoking.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.870
Alone?

32:53.939 --> 32:57.274
Look, I can't be around
sitwell, the engineer.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.275
He hates me,
I hate him.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.679
But I was talking to cliff,
the porter.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.048
For a while.
But that's it!

33:05.183 --> 33:07.584
You know everything there is
to know about this train,

33:07.653 --> 33:09.485
Don't you, mr. Pinsky?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.154
You'd know how
to derail it.

33:11.289 --> 33:12.789
Perhaps you were doing
someone a favour?

33:12.825 --> 33:14.357
Look,
I'm straight now.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.126
I wouldn't risk my job,
or my family

33:16.128 --> 33:17.694
For anybody or anything!

33:17.829 --> 33:21.564
Again, I told all this to
the inspector.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.366
Could you empty your
pockets, mr. Pinsky?

33:25.204 --> 33:26.503
No, no.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.971
If you're innocent,
as you claim, you won't mind.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.616
Cherry:
Explain that, mr. Pinsky.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.352
I never seen
that before!

33:42.354 --> 33:44.587
This was used
to kill ben miller.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.489
I never killed anybody!
That's not mine!

33:46.525 --> 33:48.591
You're going to be locked up
until the police arrive.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.060
No, I'm not!
I never did anything!

33:50.062 --> 33:51.461
Get into the pantry.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.062
There's no way I'm going to let
you women tell me what to do!

33:53.098 --> 33:54.798
Mr. Adams, can you
help us get him in?

33:54.800 --> 33:55.899
No! I tell you---

33:56.034 --> 33:59.001
No! Let me go! Let me go!

33:59.038 --> 34:00.336
Lock the door!

34:05.511 --> 34:07.510
Well done, everyone.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.683
Get that thing down!
Get my baby out of the sky!

34:13.752 --> 34:16.286
-I can't.
-Well, figure it out!

34:16.288 --> 34:19.256
But, henry,
I don't know how.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.424
Higgins: Aren't you supposed
to be the smart one?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.626
About most things, yes.

34:23.662 --> 34:26.029
Ah.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.431
Perhaps we could
use something?

34:27.566 --> 34:28.832
Use what?

34:28.901 --> 34:30.834
That's not going
to be long enough!

34:30.969 --> 34:32.502
No, no.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.639
Do you suppose we
could shoot it down?

34:35.774 --> 34:38.775
With a gun? No!

34:38.910 --> 34:41.978
No? No, no.

34:42.047 --> 34:45.048
Ah. Well, it's going up!

34:45.183 --> 34:46.983
Perhaps we can
catch it from the roof?

34:47.052 --> 34:48.218
The roof? Yes!
Very good.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.819
-Let's go!
-Oh, wait. Wait.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.589
It's heading
toward those wires.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.191
Ah-- oh.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.994
-Ah, jordan!
-Oh, no!

34:58.130 --> 34:59.129
Jordan!

35:02.000 --> 35:03.399
Jordan?

35:03.469 --> 35:04.668
Look who we found.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.369
Oh! Jordan!

35:06.405 --> 35:07.437
My remote control!

35:07.572 --> 35:08.805
The baby was
playing with it.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.340
We were walking past
and found this little one

35:10.342 --> 35:11.674
Sitting on the ground.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.343
And then, uh...

35:13.412 --> 35:15.412
This.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.681
You really should be
more careful, henry.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.016
Oh. Oh, jordan.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.351
Hi, baby.

35:21.486 --> 35:22.619
Ah, thank you.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.220
Oh, you scared me.

35:27.092 --> 35:28.491
Effie, how are you?

35:28.527 --> 35:31.494
Feel so woozy
from that laudanum.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.429
Never had it before.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.764
I feel...

35:34.766 --> 35:37.968
As if I've been
removed from my body.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.270
I suppose right now
that's a good thing.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.838
Your pulse is strong.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.106
Can you feel
anything in your leg?

35:43.108 --> 35:44.707
[winces]

35:44.743 --> 35:45.909
That's a good
thing.

35:46.044 --> 35:48.578
I heard some shouting.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.848
Well, we did find out
who killed ben miller

35:51.917 --> 35:53.849
And derailed the train.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.852
It was the fireman,
mr. Pinsky.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.854
Where is he now?

35:57.989 --> 36:00.389
Locked in the pantry.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.195
Did he jingle?

36:05.197 --> 36:06.796
Did he jingle?

36:06.832 --> 36:09.199
The man who killed
the other man.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.001
I think you need
a little more rest, effie.

36:11.136 --> 36:14.204
They came right by me:
A man in brown boots,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.873
Limping, and a man
in black boots.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.475
He was jingling.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.142
They were over
by the lavatory.

36:20.179 --> 36:23.346
They had a bit
of a scuffle.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.217
Did you see anything,
mrs. Dooley?

36:28.253 --> 36:30.320
Uh, no, dear.
I'm afraid I didn't.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.689
But I did see the fireman you're
talking about, mr. Pinsky.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.761
When?

36:37.896 --> 36:39.095
Before the crash.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.431
He was on the runner board,
near the passenger car,

36:41.500 --> 36:43.799
Whistling as if he didn't
have a care in the world.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.469
That doesn't
prove anything.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.971
I didn't say it does.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.707
But I saw him outside, too,
after the miller man escaped.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.175
Are you sure?

36:53.212 --> 36:55.178
He was having a few
nips from his flask.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.113
Maybe he didn't like
to tell you ladies.

36:57.182 --> 37:00.182
Are we sure
it's mr. Pinsky?

37:00.219 --> 37:02.652
He did have
the murder weapon on him.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.121
What's his connection
to ben miller?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.291
-Mr. Adams.
-Hmm?

37:08.293 --> 37:09.725
Oh.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.527
I've been trying to piece
together what happened today

37:11.563 --> 37:14.196
And there's something
that's bothering me.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.399
Did you see mr. Pinsky
at all in the train?

37:16.435 --> 37:18.534
It seems to me he
spent the day outside.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.204
No one saw anyone
near the lavatory

37:21.339 --> 37:23.406
When mr. Miller
was killed.

37:23.541 --> 37:25.909
And he still had the murder
weapon in his pocket.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.279
Why would he keep it
and not try to hide it?

37:29.414 --> 37:32.282
I don't claim to know
the minds of men.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.616
Well, you said
it was pinsky.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.086
We'll just keep him locked up
'til the help comes.

37:36.221 --> 37:39.222
Yes. But there could be
another suspect on the train.

37:39.357 --> 37:42.158
Perhaps someone
who knew mr. Miller?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.694
Maybe. Maybe not.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.963
You should just
let this go.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.499
Well, I've learned to
trust my instincts

37:49.634 --> 37:51.368
When they're telling me
something isn't right.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.768
Just leave it alone.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.975
Did you have anything to do with
derailing this train, mr. Adams?

38:00.112 --> 38:02.978
I can't believe this.

38:07.319 --> 38:08.984
Well, I can let
this go for now,

38:09.021 --> 38:11.921
But perhaps there's
a connection

38:11.990 --> 38:13.390
Between you and mr. Miller

38:13.392 --> 38:15.058
That you're not
telling us about?

38:15.127 --> 38:17.527
You just keep
sticking your nose

38:17.529 --> 38:18.861
Where it don't belong.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.530
You don't understand.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.365
Tell me, mr. Adams.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.999
Help me understand.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.669
Ben miller was going to
testify against my brother.

38:26.672 --> 38:30.272
And he'd be lying, just to
keep himself out of jail.

38:30.309 --> 38:32.509
I couldn't prove it,
but he'd be lying.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.243
And I had to stop him.

38:34.279 --> 38:38.481
So you killed him and planted
the razor on mr. Pinsky?

38:38.616 --> 38:39.716
I wouldn't have
had to frame pinsky

38:39.785 --> 38:41.318
If it wasn't
for your meddling.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.122
Now I'm going to have
to take care of you.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.559
Don't be stupid.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.494
I've seen how you are.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.230
I let you go,
you won't forget this.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.499
I don't want to do this.

38:56.634 --> 38:58.934
You left me no choice!

39:13.218 --> 39:14.984
Thomas!

39:19.691 --> 39:20.857
That did the trick.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.525
What are you doing up
after your surgery?

39:22.561 --> 39:24.060
You're welcome.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.795
Come on inside.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.135
All right, jordan.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.403
There we go.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.737
All right.

39:34.806 --> 39:37.206
I suppose I should thank you
for taking care of her today.

39:37.341 --> 39:40.276
Oh, henry, I am so sorry about
what's happened today.

39:40.312 --> 39:41.945
Don't apologize, sir.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.946
Watching a crawling
baby is tricky,

39:43.982 --> 39:46.248
Even for
a great detective.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.787
Henry, do you ever wonder if...

39:52.991 --> 39:54.424
Higgins:
What?

39:54.426 --> 39:58.561
If perhaps baby jordan
is highly advanced for her age?

40:00.298 --> 40:01.831
You mean a genius?

40:01.833 --> 40:04.600
Well, I've never
considered that.

40:04.636 --> 40:06.703
Of course,
you're a bright baby.

40:06.705 --> 40:10.907
I suppose I've never
felt outsmarted by her.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.109
I've never had need
to really consider--

40:13.111 --> 40:15.645
No. No, of course not.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.647
Never mind.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.583
Ah. Well.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.387
Ah, sir?

40:24.522 --> 40:28.925
I think it might be best if we
never mention today to ruth.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.060
I would
appreciate that.

40:31.096 --> 40:35.331
In fact, I think it may be best
we never speak of it again.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.344
Henry!

40:50.181 --> 40:51.347
Yes, sir?

40:51.349 --> 40:54.217
Henry, someone has
solved my chess problem.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.953
It's been here for weeks.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.889
And, aside from you, no one
else has been in this room,

41:00.024 --> 41:01.157
Except for baby jordan.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.394
[laughs]

41:05.464 --> 41:07.297
Well,
that's impossible, sir!

41:07.299 --> 41:09.632
Girls can't play chess!

41:11.369 --> 41:12.368
Oh, detective!

41:21.379 --> 41:23.379

the porter, inspector,

41:23.381 --> 41:24.380
In your condition.

41:24.382 --> 41:25.848
Tough as
old boots, me.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.917
-Yes, you are.
-Old boots.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.358
Can I have more
of that drink?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.560
I think you've
had quite enough.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.329
I think you've
had quite enough!

41:39.464 --> 41:41.731
So, mr. Adams'
brother is on trial

41:41.800 --> 41:44.166
And he wanted to stop mr. Miller
from testifying against him.

41:44.236 --> 41:47.603
Apparently, he truly believed
his brother is innocent.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.372
And risked everyone's
lives on the train

41:49.374 --> 41:51.140
To help him
win his court case?

41:51.142 --> 41:54.210
But we're all still alive,
thanks to dr. Ogden.

41:54.212 --> 41:57.280
And mrs. Hart.
Thank you, violet.

Oh, thank god!

42:03.755 --> 42:06.422
Doctor, you should go
and talk to whoever's in charge.

42:06.491 --> 42:07.556
There's lots to explain.

42:07.692 --> 42:10.159
Yes, I will as soon
as I get you and effie

42:10.295 --> 42:12.094
Off to the closest hospital.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.297
Will they have some more
of that drink there?

42:14.299 --> 42:17.166
They'll have lots
and lots and lots of it.

42:17.235 --> 42:18.801
We better go!

42:29.714 --> 42:32.515
Today was exactly
what I needed.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.450
For me to buy
the drinks all afternoon?

42:34.486 --> 42:37.253
That and a bit of,
uh, spirited shouting.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.388
It is strangely
cathartic, isn't it?

42:41.293 --> 42:43.993
It's still early.
Could go back to your place.

42:44.128 --> 42:46.663

There's clara,

Samuel cried all afternoon.

-He does.
