WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.545 --> 00:13.147
* ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:13.181 --> 00:14.448
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:14.482 --> 00:22.423
*

00:35.436 --> 00:37.471
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:37.505 --> 00:46.280
*

00:46.314 --> 00:50.351
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:50.384 --> 00:53.454
* CUE THE PULSE
TO BEGIN *

00:53.487 --> 00:56.657
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:02.363 --> 01:03.564
- NOT EVEN
A YEAR AGO

01:03.597 --> 01:05.366
WE WERE GETTING
MARRIED IN CANADA.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.700
- NOW WE'RE BACK FIGHTING
FOR OUR RIGHTS.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.636
- THANKS TO THAT ASSHOLE
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:08.669 --> 01:12.206
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SOUNDING MORE
AND MORE LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.108
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I WOULD'VE SAID,

01:14.142 --> 01:16.677
"FUCK YOU," BUT NOW I'LL
TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.581
- NOW, I ASK YOU,
WHO COULD THINK THAT

01:20.614 --> 01:22.316
WAS AN ABOMINATION?

01:22.350 --> 01:24.318
- A LOT OF PEOPLE, DEB.
MOST PEOPLE.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.853
- YEAH, WELL,
THEY'RE WRONG.

01:25.886 --> 01:29.190
AND THAT INCLUDES THAT ASSHOLE
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.624
EVERY TIME I READ
ABOUT A GAY MINISTER

01:30.658 --> 01:32.593
BEING DEFROCKED
OR A GAY COUPLE

01:32.626 --> 01:34.195
HAVING THEIR KIDS
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM,

01:34.228 --> 01:35.629
IT JUST FUCKING
BREAKS MY HEART.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.465
- OKAY, WE'RE NEXT.
- PROTECT THE FAMILY.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.200
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.269
PROTECT CHRISTIAN VALUES.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.871
VOTE YES ON 14.
- VOTE YES.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.474
STOP THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.509
- PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.212
VOTE YES ON 14.

01:51.245 --> 01:55.383
[overlapping statements]

01:55.416 --> 01:58.619
- STOP THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.821
- JESUS FORGIVES SINNERS.
- VOTE YES ON 14.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.657
- JESUS FORGIVES SINNERS.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.794
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.163
JESUS THINKS
YOU STINK.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.498
- PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.366
PROTECT CHRISTIAN VALUES.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.302
VOTE YES ON 14...

02:14.335 --> 02:17.538
[chatter]

02:17.571 --> 02:20.374
- WHAT A FABULOUS EVENT
THIS IS GOING TO BE,

02:20.408 --> 02:22.376
IF THE PLANNER
DOES SAY SO HIMSELF.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.577
NOW, HOW MANY TICKETS
HAVE WE SOLD?

02:23.611 --> 02:26.380
- OVER 300.
- AND COUNTING.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.516
- AT 200 A POP,
THAT'S OVER 60,000.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.384
- AND THAT DOESN'T
EVEN INCLUDE WHAT WE'LL MAKE

02:30.418 --> 02:32.420
DURING THE SILENT AUCTION.
- NOT BAD FOR A NIGHT'S WORK.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.555
- NOW IF I COULD
JUST GET DREW TO ATTEND...

02:34.588 --> 02:35.656
- THINK OF THE MEDIA
ATTENTION WE'D GET.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.690
YOU CAN'T BUY THAT.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.326
- WELL, LIKE MY AUNT LULAH

02:38.359 --> 02:40.261
ALWAYS SAID, THEY CAN'T SHOOT
YOU FOR ASKING.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.331
- HA.
- ROY.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.332
I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY PLANNING COMMITTEE

02:44.365 --> 02:45.533
AND FRIENDS, BEN.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.935
- HI.
- MICHAEL, EMMETT.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.470
- HOW DO YOU DO?

02:49.503 --> 02:50.838
- THIS IS ROY HARRIS,
THE HOTEL MANAGER.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.673
HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC,
SO HELPFUL.

02:52.706 --> 02:53.807
- THANKS FOR CUTTING US
SUCH A GREAT DEAL.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.409
- DON'T THANK ME JUST YET.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.810
I'M AFRAID
I HAVE BAD NEWS.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.746
CORPORATE
JUST CALLED.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.448
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO LET YOU HOLD THE EVENT HERE.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.982
- EXCUSE ME?
- WHAT?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.451
- WHY DID THEY
CHANGE THEIR MINDS?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.286
- THAT'S PRIVILEGED
INFORMATION.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.455
- CONSIDERING
YOU JUST TANKED OUR EVENT,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.323
I THINK WE DESERVE
THE PRIVILEGE OF AN EXPLANATION.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.296
- LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S
A COUPLE OF VERY LARGE ACCOUNTS

03:15.329 --> 03:17.231
CORPORATE'S AFRAID
OF ALIENATING.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.632
- BY HAVING
AN EVENT

03:18.666 --> 03:20.868
THEY MIGHT BE PERCEIVED
AS GAY-FRIENDLY.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.239
- LOOK, I SUPPORT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING 100%.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.375
I'VE BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP
FOR 15 YEARS.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.843
I WANT TO PROTECT THAT.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.479
BUT I ALSO HAVE
TO PROTECT MY JOB.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.448
- [clears throat]

03:34.482 --> 03:36.750
- I'M SORRY.

03:39.787 --> 03:44.024
[folder drops]

03:44.057 --> 03:47.361
- OH, YEAH. HE'S HOT.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.664
- SCHMIDT.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.600
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT PLAYING WITH YOURSELF

03:52.633 --> 03:55.536
DURING OFFICE HOURS?
- FUCK, BRIAN...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.004
- RELAX, THEODORE.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.639
THIS ISN'T
WERTSHAFTER'S.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.275
YOU'RE IN A JERK-OFF-FRIENDLY
ENVIRONMENT.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.476
- I WASN'T JERKING OFF.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.745
I'M ON MY QUEST
FOR A HUSBAND.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.915
- THE LATEST HOMO
TO JOIN THE RANK OF DEFECTORS.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.783
SO, WHO'S THE STIFF?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.352
AND I DON'T MEAN THAT
IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.621
- AS YOU KNOW, I LOST
MY JEWISH DOCTOR.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.490
SO I DECIDED TO TRY
HUSBANDMATERIAL.COM.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.025
IT'S, UH...
IT'S THIS WEBSITE.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.027
IT'S FULL OF QUALITY GUYS
LIKE MYSELF

04:20.060 --> 04:21.629
WHO ARE LOOKING
FOR THE PERFECT PARTNER.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.832
- SO WHAT TREASURES HAVE
YOU UNCOVERED ON-LINE?

04:24.865 --> 04:27.301
- WELL, THIS IS RICHARD.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.936
HE'S 36.
HE'S A LAWYER.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.704
HE OWNS HIS OWN HOUSE,

04:30.738 --> 04:33.407
AND HE LIKES TO CUDDLE
AFTER A LONG DAY.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.675
AH...
OH, THIS IS JAMES.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.510
35. HE'S A DENTIST.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.547
AND HE LIKES...
HUH, WELL,

04:39.580 --> 04:41.382
TO CUDDLE AFTER A LONG DAY.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.516
UH...
OH, THIS IS LEWIS.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.817
HE'S 37.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.819
HE OWNS HIS OWN BUSINESS,
AND...

04:45.853 --> 04:47.788
both: HE LIKES TO CUDDLE
AFTER A LONG DAY.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.923
[laughter]

04:49.957 --> 04:52.526
- DOESN'T ANYONE
LIKE TO FUCK?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.961
LET'S SEE SOME COCK SHOTS.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.796
- THERE ARE NO COCK SHOTS.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.399
- WELL, THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF THEY'RE QUALITY MEN?

04:58.432 --> 04:59.833
MOVE OVER.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.444
THIS IS ROLAND.
HE'S 32.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.413
HE DOESN'T HAVE
TIME FOR A CAREER.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.681
HE LIKES TO CUDDLE

05:13.714 --> 05:15.315
AFTER BEING POUNDED
INTO OBLIVION.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.420
- TOO BAD FOR YOU
HE'S IN AUSTRALIA.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.988
- NOT REALLY, SINCE I
PLAN ON BEING THERE

05:21.021 --> 05:24.425
IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.026
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE DOCTOR.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.698
I GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.500
I'M COMPLETELY
CANCER-FREE.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.368
- THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.569
- YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.837
SO TO CELEBRATE
I'M GOING TO GO

05:36.870 --> 05:38.506
TO GAY MARDI GRAS
IN SYDNEY.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.608
- WELL, I WISH
I COULD GO.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.912
- WHAT? YOU'VE GOT
TO FIND A HUBBY.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.947
G'DAY, MATE.

05:50.551 --> 05:54.455
[door shuts]

05:54.488 --> 05:57.891
[approaching footsteps]

05:57.925 --> 06:01.762
[both gasping]

06:06.634 --> 06:07.735
- SMELLS GOOD.

06:07.768 --> 06:12.005
- YEAH, I FELT
LIKE COOKING.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.941
YOU RAN OUT
THIS MORNING.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.544
- [scoffs]
I DIDN'T RUN OUT.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.011
I HAD A MEETING
AT THE HOTEL.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.647
- HOW'D IT GO?

06:19.680 --> 06:23.484
- OH, THEY TOLD US TO, UH, FIND
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.653
- WHAT?
- WE HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER VENUE.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.588
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT, ISN'T IT?

06:29.557 --> 06:32.626
[both gasping]

06:32.660 --> 06:35.463
- I'M GOING TO GO TAKE A SHOWER.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.099
- MEL?

06:40.668 --> 06:42.803
LOOK.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.772
I GLUED IT
BACK TOGETHER.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.807
IF YOU TURN
IT LIKE THIS,

06:46.840 --> 06:50.444
YOU HARDLY NOTICE
THE CRACKS.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.546
ARE WE JUST
GOING TO PRETEND

06:52.580 --> 06:55.649
AS IF IT NEVER HAPPENED?

06:55.683 --> 06:57.451
- [sighs]

06:57.485 --> 06:59.587
NO ONE'S PRETENDING.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.991
IN FACT, I HEAR IT HAPPENS
TO A LOT OF DIVORCED COUPLES.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.793
SOME SAY THE SEX
IS EVEN HOTTER

07:05.826 --> 07:08.496
THAN WHEN THEY
WERE MARRIED.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.833
IT WAS A MISTAKE,

07:12.866 --> 07:18.005
A MOMENTARY LAPSE
IN JUDGEMENT.

07:18.038 --> 07:22.142
- JUST ONE OF THOSE IN-THE-HEAT-
OF-THE-MOMENT SORT OF THINGS.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.877
- PRECISELY.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.880
- THEN I GUESS
WE SHOULD DISREGARD IT.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.718
MOVE ON.

07:30.751 --> 07:36.490
- I THINK THAT
WOULD BE BEST.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.165
- DEB, DID YOU
EVER DATE A YOUNGER MAN?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.501
- SUNSHINE, UNTIL
CARL CAME ALONG,

07:47.535 --> 07:50.037
I WAS BARELY DATING
A LIVING ONE.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.172
- BUT IF YOU'D
HAD THE CHANCE...

07:52.205 --> 07:54.041
- I'D HAVE
JUMPED ON IT.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.909
WHICH IS WHAT I HOPE
YOUR MOTHER'S DOING.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.712
- YEAH, BUT HE'S
HALF HER AGE.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.548
- GEEZ, YOU...
YOU KIDS,

08:00.581 --> 08:02.282
YOU DON'T CUT YOUR PARENTS
MUCH SLACK, DO YOU?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.518
WELL, UNDER
THE SEXUAL BILL OF RIGHTS...

08:04.552 --> 08:06.620
THAT IS, IF WE STILL
HAVE ANY RIGHTS,

08:06.654 --> 08:09.122
SHE'S ENTITLED TO THE SAME
FREEDOMS YOU AND BRIAN HAVE.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.759
- HAD.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.863
- YOU CATCH MY DRIFT.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.665
[sneezes]

08:17.698 --> 08:19.633
FUCKING PEPPER.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.935
- I'VE DONE MY SHARE
OF RUNNING AROUND,

08:21.969 --> 08:23.737
BUT WHEN I READ
YOUR DESCRIPTION

08:23.771 --> 08:26.874
THAT YOU ENJOY SPENDING
QUIET EVENINGS AT HOME,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.943
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT IT I FOUND VERY APPEALING.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.679
- TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, I'VE--

08:31.712 --> 08:34.014
I'VE NEVER LIKED
GOING OUT MUCH.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
YOU SEE, WHEN
I WAS A KID,

08:35.683 --> 08:37.818
"THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY REUNION"
CAME TO TOWN,

08:37.851 --> 08:41.889
AND, UM... I WANTED DANNY
BONADUCE'S AUTOGRAPH SO BAD.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.625
SO I WAITED IN LINE
FOR FOUR HOURS,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.226
AND THEN FINALLY
THERE THEY WERE,

08:46.259 --> 08:48.295
DRESSED IN THOSE
WHITE JUMPSUITS.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.063
- OH, GOD, I REMEMBER THOSE.

08:50.097 --> 08:54.334
DAVID CASSIDY.
I HAD SUCH A CRUSH.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.837
- ANYWAY, THERE
WAS A STAMPEDE.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.642
I GOT TRAMPLED.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.110
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.344
- YEAH, IT...
IT WAS...

09:04.377 --> 09:06.680
IT WAS PRETTY
TERRIFYING.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.115
IN FACT, I-I STILL GET NERVOUS

09:08.148 --> 09:10.083
BEING IN A CROWD.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.252
- SO HOW'S THE DATE GOING?

09:12.285 --> 09:14.655
- IT'S NOT A DATE, DEB.
WE'RE JUST GETTING ACQUAINTED.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.323
- AH, YOU MEAN
CHECKING EACH OTHER OUT

09:16.356 --> 09:18.091
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE NOT TROLLS?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.060
AND THEN YOU GO AND FUCK?
HA!

09:20.093 --> 09:23.797
[laughter]

09:23.831 --> 09:26.033
- YEAH, DEB HAS A WAY OF CUTTING
RIGHT TO THE CHASE.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.336
SO HAVE WE, UH...

09:29.369 --> 09:33.273
OFFICIALLY PASSED
THE TROLL TEST?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.808
- YEAH.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.077
- WELL, HOW ABOUT A REAL DATE?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.613
- GREAT.
- I JUST BOUGHT TWO TICKETS

09:39.647 --> 09:41.348
TO THE "STOP PROP 14"
BENEFIT THURSDAY NIGHT.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.717
CYNDI LAUPER'S
PERFORMING.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.020
- I-I-I'D LOVE TO,
B-BUT, UH...

09:47.054 --> 09:50.958
- CROWDS. RIGHT.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.260
UM, WELL, SOME OTHER TIME.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.831
- NO...
NO, WAIT.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.367
MY THERAPIST SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT
I STARE DOWN MY DEMONS

10:00.400 --> 10:04.905
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.241
- YOU SURE?
- IT'S A DATE.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.877
- GREAT.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.279
- UH, 300, MAYBE
AS MANY AS 400.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.747
- FOR THIS THURSDAY NIGHT.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.115
- YES, I KNOW
IT'S A BIG CROWD.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.316
- YEAH, I KNOW
IT'S SHORT NOTICE.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.285
- WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE IT WORK.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.253
- SATURDAY WON'T WORK.
- ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.789
- THERE'S NO WAY
THAT YOU CAN--

10:21.822 --> 10:24.424
- WELL, THANKS.
- THANKS ANYWAY.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.859
- NO LUCK?
- NADA.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.395
- SAME HERE.
- SO WHO'S LEFT?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.863
- THAT'S IT.
EVERYTHING'S EITHER BOOKED

10:29.897 --> 10:31.865
OR THEY DON'T WANT US.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.834
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.706
- [sighs]

10:41.108 --> 10:44.277
THERE'S ONE PLACE.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.146
- I'M NOT ASKING
HIM FOR ANYTHING.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.882
- MICHAEL, THIS
IS IMPORTANT.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.784
CAN'T YOU AND BRIAN PUT ASIDE
YOUR DIFFERENCES FOR ONE NIGHT?

10:50.818 --> 10:54.221
- I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.757
- WELL, THEN I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO CALL THE CENTER,

10:56.790 --> 10:59.727
TELL THEM THE BENEFIT'S OFF.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.365
- YOU'VE GOT TO TRY
THE BODYLINE.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.902
MM, THE BEST BATH-HOUSE
IN SYDNEY.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.904
- BODYLINE?
- THAT'S IT, MATE.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.740
FUCK ME HARDER!

11:14.374 --> 11:16.076
- WHAT ABOUT CLUBS?

11:16.109 --> 11:19.312
- I PREFER ARC
ON OXFORD.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.448
A FRIENDLY
YOUNG CROWD.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.950
AH!

11:22.983 --> 11:24.785
- ARC ON OXFORD.
- MM.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.919
AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT'S
PACKED ON THE WEEKENDS.

11:25.953 --> 11:26.987
OH, YEAH!

11:27.020 --> 11:28.055
[knocking on door]

11:28.088 --> 11:30.824
[both groaning]

11:30.858 --> 11:31.825
[knocking continues]

11:31.859 --> 11:33.093
DON'T STOP.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.194
AH. I'M CLOSE.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.829
OH, YEAH!

11:35.863 --> 11:37.931
[cell phone buzzing]

11:37.965 --> 11:39.833
OH, YES. YES.
- JESUS CHRIST!

11:39.867 --> 11:42.936
[both gasping]

11:42.970 --> 11:44.137
- OH! OH, YES.
OH.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.373
[pounding on door]
- SHIT!

11:54.982 --> 11:56.416
- GEEZ. I WAS CALLING
AND CALLING.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.417
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BUY
A STICK OF DYNAMITE

11:57.450 --> 11:59.019
AND BLAST THE DOOR DOWN?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.822
- IT'S THE BROWN
ATHLETICS ACCOUNT.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.825
OOPS...
SORRY.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.860
- NOT AS SORRY AS HE IS.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.096
LEO BROWN JUST HEARD
ABOUT DREW BOYD.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.264
HE WANTS ANOTHER SPOKESMAN
FOR HIS UNDERWEAR LINE.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.901
- DID YOU TELL HIM THAT WE'VE
ALREADY BOOKED THE PHOTO SHOOT?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.769
THAT THE AD SPACE
HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.270
- HE SAID THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.772
BUT IF YOU DON'T
FIND SOMEONE ELSE,

12:18.806 --> 12:22.375
YOU'LL HAVE
A BIGGER ONE.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.877
- THE BOTTOM LINE,

12:23.911 --> 12:26.847
A GAY PLAYER IS DISRUPTIVE
TO A TEAM.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.448
IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE
IN A LOCKER ROOM...

12:28.481 --> 12:30.117
- DON'T TELL ME
THAT HIS TEAMMATES

12:30.150 --> 12:32.119
ARE AFRAID HE'S
GOING TO JUMP THEM?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.386
THOSE BIG GUYS CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.322
NO. BESIDES,
HE DIDN'T CHASE THEM

12:35.355 --> 12:36.456
AROUND THE SHOWERS BEFORE,
WHY WOULD HE NOW?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.258
- BY ANNOUNCING
THAT HE WAS GAY,

12:38.291 --> 12:41.128
DREW BOYD HAS SEPARATED HIMSELF
FROM THE REST OF THE TEAM.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.796
THE SPIRIT OF UNITY,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.898
THE PLAYING TOGETHER AS ONE,
HAS BEEN BROKEN,

12:44.932 --> 12:46.867
AND IT CAN NEVER
BE REPAIRED.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.268
- SO ARE YOU SAYING THEY
SHOULD GET RID OF HIM?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.037
- IF HE WAS PLAYING
ON MY TEAM, I WOULD.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.538
I'D SAY I HAD NO CHOICE.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.073
- HEY, I WAS WATCHING THAT.
- WHY?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.342
SO YOU CAN GET
EVEN MORE DEPRESSED?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.912
I HAVE JUST THE THING TO TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF IT.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.280
- MADAME X.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.416
- STARRING THE UNJUSTLY
UNDERRATED LANA TURNER.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.819
WHAT A PERFORMANCE.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.888
LANA HAS AN ILLICIT AFFAIR

13:07.921 --> 13:09.222
AND, AFTER BEING DISCOVERED,

13:09.256 --> 13:11.024
IS FORCED TO FORFEIT
HER IDENTITY,

13:11.058 --> 13:12.459
BLESS HER HEART.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.162
SHE WANDERS THE WORLD
IN A DRUNKEN STUPOR,

13:15.195 --> 13:16.964
FINALLY TO RETURN HOME

13:16.997 --> 13:20.233
AND MURDER HER BLACKMAILER.

13:20.267 --> 13:23.436
- AND THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.472
- YEAH, WELL,
LANA ALWAYS DOES IT FOR ME.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.045
- HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT, UH, REALLY

13:32.079 --> 13:33.380
MIGHT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

13:33.413 --> 13:36.083
COMING WITH ME
TO THE "STOP PROP 14" EVENT.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.185
YOU COULD MEET
YOUR GAY FANS.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.487
SEE WHAT A ROLE MODEL,
AN INSPIRATION YOU'VE BECOME.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.589
- I TOLD YOU, I'M
A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER,

13:42.622 --> 13:44.624
NOT A PROFESSIONAL FAG.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.227
SO STOP TRYING TO GET ME TO BE
THE NEW GAY POSTER BOY.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.235
- BETTER TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.205
YOU'VE GOT A NEAR-NAKED
PHOTO SHOOT COMING UP.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.540
- THERE'S NOT GOING
TO BE A PHOTO SHOOT.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.942
YOUR FRIEND KINNEY CALLED.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.410
HE FIRED ME.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.648
- BRIAN FIRED YOU?

14:08.681 --> 14:11.851
- I'VE NOW OFFICIALLY
LOST EVERYTHING.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.122
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T
BE EASY COMING OUT,

14:15.155 --> 14:18.025
BUT I NEVER EXPECTED
IT WOULD BE THIS BAD.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.631
- YOU HAVEN'T LOST ME.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.969
WE'LL FIGURE
THIS OUT.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.038
- IF YOU DON'T MIND...

14:31.071 --> 14:32.906
I NEED SOME TIME ALONE.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.211
- SURE.
I UNDERSTAND.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.136
- [sighing]
- IT'S FREEZING, HUH?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.705
- HEY, WE COULD GO
BACK TO MY PLACE.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.075
I'LL WARM YOU UP.
- [chuckles]

15:08.108 --> 15:12.479
IT'S KIND OF LATE AND...

15:12.512 --> 15:14.081
CORINNE...
- I KNOW.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.415
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.549
- NO. IT'S NOT YOU.
- I...

15:16.583 --> 15:19.419
- I SWEAR.
- I KNOW THAT TOO.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.322
IT'S LINDSAY.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.957
HEY, COME ON.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.359
YOU DON'T NEED A SPECIAL TEAM
OF INVESTIGATORS

15:26.393 --> 15:29.162
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S WHAT.

15:29.196 --> 15:33.333
BESIDES, IT'S
NOT A CRIME.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.603
- MIND IF I ASK YOU
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY?

15:39.739 --> 15:41.641
- [sighing]

15:43.743 --> 15:46.479
PENGUINS.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.216
WHEN MY DAD
LEFT MY MOM,

15:49.249 --> 15:51.618
SHE WAS SO OBSESSED,
YOU COULD MENTION ANY SUBJECT

15:51.651 --> 15:53.720
AND SOMEHOW...
[sniffling]

15:53.753 --> 15:56.189
SHE'D MAKE IT
ABOUT HIM.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.590
"PENGUINS."

15:57.624 --> 16:00.127
"YOUR FATHER HATED
WEARING A TUXEDO."

16:00.160 --> 16:01.494
- OHH.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.463
- YOU'RE THE SAME WAY.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.098
"JULIA ROBERTS."

16:05.132 --> 16:09.136
"LINDSAY GOT HER HAIR
CUT LIKE JULIA ROBERTS."

16:09.169 --> 16:11.271
"THE FRENCH
HATE AMERICANS."

16:11.304 --> 16:13.973
"LINDSAY MAKES
A GREAT BOUILLABAISSE."

16:16.576 --> 16:20.213
- I DIDN'T REALIZE.
- WELL, WHY SHOULD YOU?

16:20.247 --> 16:24.251
REFERRING TO HER IS AS AUTOMATIC
TO YOU AS BLINKING.

16:24.284 --> 16:29.089
JUST...
NEXT TIME, BE FAIR.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.657
UNTIL YOU CAN BUY
A TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE

16:30.690 --> 16:35.095
AND NOT MENTION
LINDSAY'S PERFECT SMILE,

16:35.128 --> 16:37.597
DON'T LET SOME POOR GIRL
THINK SHE'S GOT A CHANCE.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.634
- THAT'S ANDY PRATHER.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.303
HE'S THE RUNNING BACK
FOR THE CHARGERS.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.107
- HMM. DEFINITELY
THE HOTTEST OF THE HOTTIES.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.308
AH, CHECK OUT
THOSE ABS.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.677
- I HAVE,
ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.145
- STRAIGHT, RIGHT?

16:52.179 --> 16:53.780
- YEAH, I HAVE
SEVERAL TEENAGE GIRLS

16:53.813 --> 16:55.315
WHO WILL SWEAR UNDER OATH
THEY'VE BEEN RAPED BY HIM.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.284
- PERFECT.
WHEN CAN HE BE HERE?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.252
- AS SOON AS YOU SIGN OFF,
HE'LL BE ON THE NEXT PLANE.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.389
- BOOK HIM.
- OKAY.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.325
- HEY, TEDDY.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.528
- MICHAEL.
WOW, IT'S A...

17:08.561 --> 17:12.399
SURPRISE TO SEE YOU...
HERE. R-RIGHT, BRI?

17:12.432 --> 17:15.502
ISN'T IT A SURPRISE
TO, UH, SEE HIM HERE?

17:17.237 --> 17:19.406
- I'M SPEECHLESS.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.808
EXCEPT TO SAY THAT IF YOU
AND YOUR GUEST WILL EXCUSE ME...

17:21.841 --> 17:24.744
- ACTUALLY, I'M
HERE TO SEE YOU.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.816
- OH, WELL, I'LL--I'LL--I'LL--
I'LL JUST--

17:29.849 --> 17:31.451
I'LL TAKE OFF
AND LEAVE YOU TWO

17:31.484 --> 17:34.087
TO DO WHATEVER
YOU TWO...

17:34.121 --> 17:36.589
NEED TO DO.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.362
- I WON'T WASTE
TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.597
- THAT'S GOOD.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.866
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE
TOO MUCH TO OFFER.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.469
- THEN I'LL GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
- THE POINT BEING
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.608
- YES.
- IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE

17:55.642 --> 17:57.577
TO APOLOGIZE,
WOULD IT?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.446
- I BELIEVE IT'S YOU
WHO OWES ME THAT.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.181
- I ALREADY OFFERED.
YOU REFUSED.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.850
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T MEAN
A GODDAMNED WORD.

18:03.883 --> 18:07.520
- BUT THAT'S NOT
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

18:07.554 --> 18:12.125
- WE LOST LE MONTAGE,
FOR THE BENEFIT.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.760
"STOP PROP 14"?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.863
- YEAH, I LIVE IN PITTSBURGH.
I'VE HEARD OF IT.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.266
- IT SEEMS THAT SOME
OF THEIR VERY IMPORTANT CLIENTS

18:19.299 --> 18:22.535
MIGHT OBJECT
TO US USING IT.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.505
WE'VE TRIED EVERY PLACE IN TOWN,

18:25.538 --> 18:28.241
BUT THEY'RE
ALL BOOKED.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.478
- EVERY PLACE,
EXCEPT...

18:31.511 --> 18:35.348
- BABYLON.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.218
- SO YOU WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY WORLD

18:38.251 --> 18:40.520
UNTIL, OF COURSE,
YOU NEED IT TO HELP YOURS.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.822
- THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY WORLD VERSUS YOUR WORLD.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.758
BUT, YOU KNOW, SINCE IT'S GOING
TO BE A PROBLEM, FORGET IT.

18:45.792 --> 18:50.497
- I DIDN'T SAY YOU
COULDN'T HAVE IT.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.501
HOW MUCH WERE YOU
PAYING LE MONTAGE?

18:54.534 --> 18:58.638
- 10,000.
WE'LL PAY YOU THE SAME.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.507
- NO, YOU WON'T.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.708
- LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GOUGE US

19:01.741 --> 19:03.310
JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE DESPERATE.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.812
WE DON'T HAVE IT.
- THERE'S NO CHARGE.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.650
- REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.220
YOU CAN CONSIDER IT
MY DONATION TO THE CAUSE.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.726
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.529
- WELL, "THANKS"
WILL DO.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.796
NOW IF YOU
DON'T MIND,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.465
I HAVE TO GET
BACK TO WORK

19:25.498 --> 19:28.167
SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE
MY DECADENT LIFESTYLE.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.309
CYNTHIA, WILL YOU GET ME
LEO BROWN ON THE PHONE, PLEASE?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.445
THANKS.

19:43.316 --> 19:47.420
- LINZ? LINZ!
- IN HERE.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.289
- IT'S A LOVELY HOME,
AND THERE AREN'T A LOT

19:49.322 --> 19:51.224
OF DESIRABLE PROPERTIES
ON THE MARKET THESE DAYS.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.360
- THEN YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO SELL?

19:53.393 --> 19:55.295
- PROVIDED INTEREST RATES
DON'T GO ANY HIGH--

19:55.328 --> 19:57.897
HI, MEL.
- OH...

19:57.930 --> 19:59.332
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.467
- NO, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.568
I ASKED JENNIFER
TO STOP BY,

20:01.601 --> 20:02.602
TAKE A LOOK
AT THE HOUSE.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.703
- I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO PUT

20:03.736 --> 20:05.572
THE HOUSE UP FOR SALE.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.740
- I UNDERSTAND WE WERE
STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.609
- JEN FIGURES WE COULD MAKE
AT LEAST 100,000,

20:09.642 --> 20:12.512
MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR A DOWN
PAYMENT ON A COUPLE OF CONDOS.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.980
- I HAVE SOME CLIENTS
WHO ARE DYING

20:14.013 --> 20:15.582
TO BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.716
I COULD SHOW IT TO THEM
BEFORE IT'S EVEN LISTED.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.986
- THAT'D BE GREAT.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.523
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.526
- YEAH, GREAT.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.628
- WHEN YOU'RE READY,
JUST GIVE ME A CALL.

20:28.661 --> 20:32.332
WE'LL START THE BALL ROLLING.
- WILL DO.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.333
- AND...

20:33.366 --> 20:35.402
SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.338
- THE BENEFIT.
- RIGHT.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.907
- BYE-BYE.
- BYE.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.477
[door opens and shuts]

20:44.511 --> 20:46.346
- SO YOU--YOU
WANT TO SELL?

20:46.379 --> 20:49.015
- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
WE BOTH DID.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.617
SO I SAY WE STOP
TALKING ABOUT IT

20:50.650 --> 20:53.486
AND GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.288
NICE FLOWERS.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.357
YEAH, I THOUGHT THEY'D...

20:57.390 --> 20:59.526
BRIGHTEN UP THE HOUSE.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.697
- 44...

21:04.731 --> 21:06.633
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN BE
SO FUCKING HEARTLESS.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.502
- 45...
- IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA

21:09.536 --> 21:11.438
HOW HARD THIS
HAS BEEN FOR HIM.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.839
HE'S LOST EVERYTHING.
- I CAN'T HELP THAT.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.907
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO FIRE HIM.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.310
- THIS IS A BUSINESS,
NOT A SUPPORT GROUP.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.312
- AND ITS PRESIDENT,
C.E.O.,

21:19.346 --> 21:20.513
WHATEVER THE FUCK
YOU CALL YOURSELF,

21:20.547 --> 21:22.081
HAPPENS TO BE GAY,
SO TELL ME,

21:22.114 --> 21:24.917
HOW CAN YOU CAVE
TO SUCH BLATANT HOMOPHOBIA?

21:24.951 --> 21:27.720
- BETTER YET, WHY DON'T I HAVE
AN EXPERT EXPLAIN?

21:27.754 --> 21:30.056
THEODORE.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.392
WOULD YOU STEP
INTO MY OFFICE, PLEASE?

21:32.425 --> 21:34.394
- I BET YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY
TO FIGHT FOR HIM, DID YOU?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.728
- NO, I DID NOT.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.730
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.432
- WHAT'S UP, BRI?
- THEODORE,

21:39.466 --> 21:40.933
HOW MUCH DO WE STAND TO LOSE

21:40.967 --> 21:42.735
IF WE LOST
THE BROWN ATHLETICS ACCOUNT?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.671
- BALLPARK FIGURE?
- THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.406
CONSIDERING IT'S
A SPORTING GOODS COMPANY.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.674
- IT'S, UM...

21:47.707 --> 21:49.008
A $20 MILLION ACCOUNT.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.843
- AND HOW MUCH PROFIT

21:50.877 --> 21:53.413
DOES THAT GENERATE
FOR KINNETIK?

21:53.446 --> 21:55.415
- SAY, ROUGHLY 2 MILLION
PER ANNUM.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.417
- THANK YOU.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.018
- YOU CAN CHASTISE
ME ALL YOU WANT

21:59.051 --> 22:00.453
FOR BEING
HEARTLESS.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.121
IT DOESN'T COST ME A CENT.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.723
BUT KINDLY
EXPLAIN TO ME

22:03.756 --> 22:06.893
WHY I SHOULD SACRIFICE
A $20 MILLION ACCOUNT

22:06.926 --> 22:09.696
JUST BECAUSE YOUR BOYFRIEND
SUDDENLY DECIDES

22:09.729 --> 22:11.731
TO ANNOUNCE
HE'S QUEER.

22:11.764 --> 22:15.101
- I CAN SEE WHY YOU'RE
A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.970
- 48...

22:18.004 --> 22:19.972
49...

22:20.006 --> 22:22.975
[Fun]

22:23.009 --> 22:30.917
*

22:33.753 --> 22:36.122
- * A TWIST OF FATE

22:36.155 --> 22:39.058
* A LUCKY BREAK

22:39.091 --> 22:41.928
* A CIRCUMSTANCE

22:41.961 --> 22:45.532
* I CAN'T WAIT

22:45.565 --> 22:48.067
* I GOTTA MAKE

22:48.100 --> 22:51.070
* MY SECOND CHANCE

22:51.103 --> 22:53.806
* I GOT THINGS TO DO

22:53.840 --> 22:56.676
* I GOTTA PUSH THROUGH

22:56.709 --> 22:58.611
* UNTIL IT'S DONE

22:58.645 --> 23:00.012
- SO YOU'RE BACK
WORKING THE STREETS.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.950
- THANKS TO YOU.
- YOU COMING?

23:03.983 --> 23:05.752
- WHY IN YOUR WILDEST
HOMOSEXUAL FANTASIES

23:05.785 --> 23:08.154
WOULD YOU IMAGINE THAT I
WOULD ATTEND SUCH AN EVENT?

23:08.187 --> 23:09.956
- YOU GAVE MICHAEL THE CLUB.

23:09.989 --> 23:13.025
- BUT HOW COULD I SAY NO TO MY
OLDEST AND DEAREST FRIEND?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.494
- AND IT IS TO PROTECT
THE RIGHTS

23:14.527 --> 23:17.029
OF EVERY GAY PERSON
IN THE STATE,

23:17.063 --> 23:18.965
INCLUDING YOURS.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.767
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT
THE GOOD FIGHT WITHOUT ME.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.703
I'LL BE TANNING
MYSELF DOWN UNDER.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.171
AND PERHAPS A LITTLE ON TOP.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.540
- YOU'RE GOING TO AUSTRALIA?

23:27.574 --> 23:28.841
- THEY SAY MARDI GRAS
IN SYDNEY'S

23:28.875 --> 23:30.076
THE GAYEST PLACE ON EARTH.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.579
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
FOR DISNEYLAND.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.654
WELL, TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.923
- YOU TOO.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.459
[engine turns over]

23:46.493 --> 23:49.061
- * KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR

23:49.095 --> 23:52.665
* LET ME IN

23:52.699 --> 23:58.104
* NO MORE SECRETS TO BE HID

23:58.137 --> 24:01.107
- LET'S HOPE EVERYONE KNOWS
THE BENEFIT'S BEEN MOVED.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.475
- A BUNCH OF US WERE
AT THE CENTER TODAY,

24:02.509 --> 24:03.943
MAKING CALLS,
SENDING E-MAILS.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.746
- HI, BABY.

24:06.779 --> 24:10.483
- YOU KNOW, I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD GET BRIAN SOMETHING.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.552
- WHAT FOR?
- IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM,

24:12.585 --> 24:13.953
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
A BENEFIT TONIGHT.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.488
- I ALREADY THANKED HIM.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.024
- IF YOU SAY SO.
- I DO.

24:18.057 --> 24:21.894
- HMM.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.095
- WHAT'S THAT FOR?
- WHAT'S WHAT FOR?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.497
- "HMM".
YOU ALWAYS SAY "HMM"

24:24.531 --> 24:25.832
WHEN YOU'RE
THINKING SOMETHING

24:25.865 --> 24:27.567
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.
- DO I?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.502
HMM. I WAS JUST THINKING
IT'S A SHAME THAT...

24:29.536 --> 24:30.970
- YOU CAN STOP
RIGHT THERE.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.905
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.240
- WELL, I'M SURE IT WASN'T
TO REMIND ME

24:34.273 --> 24:35.274
THAT I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
NEXT TUESDAY

24:35.307 --> 24:36.976
TO HAVE MY TEETH CLEANED.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.578
- ISN'T IT ALWAYS
THE FUCKING WAY?

24:38.611 --> 24:40.613
KIKI WAS SUPPOSED
TO RELIEVE ME AN HOUR AGO.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.515
SHE STILL HASN'T SHOWN UP, AND
NOW I'M STUCK WITH HER SHIFT.

24:42.549 --> 24:43.850
- THAT'S OKAY, DEB.
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.585
NO...
- HEY, DEB!

24:45.618 --> 24:47.153
WHERE'S MY CHICKEN FRICASSEE?

24:47.186 --> 24:48.921
- IT'S STILL FRICKING.
NO. I WANT YOU BOYS TO GO.

24:48.955 --> 24:49.922
THERE'S NO POINT
IN ALL OF US MISSING IT.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.057
GO.
- ARE YOU SURE?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.258
- YEAH, I'LL BE THERE AS SOON

24:52.291 --> 24:54.727
AS KIKI GETS
HER TRANNY ASS HERE.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.863
I LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.866
[service bell rings]
- DEB, ORDER'S UP.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.902
[chatter]

25:13.813 --> 25:16.616
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.651
- IN MY "FACE YOUR FEAR"
WORKSHOP,

25:18.685 --> 25:20.019
THEY TELL US TO JUST KEEP
BREATHING STEADILY

25:20.052 --> 25:22.088
LIKE THIS, IN...
[inhales]

25:22.121 --> 25:23.155
AND OUT.
[exhales]

25:23.189 --> 25:25.792
IN AND OUT.

25:25.825 --> 25:28.695
IT'S ALSO HELPFUL
TO HAVE A PARTNER COACHING YOU.

25:28.728 --> 25:32.164
- SURE YOU DIDN'T GO
TO LAMAZE BY MISTAKE?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.833
- I SURE HOPE WE CAN
FIND MA IN HERE.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.301
- I WOULDN'T WORRY.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.769
IF THERE'S ONE PERSON
YOU CAN SPOT IN A CROWD,

25:36.803 --> 25:38.170
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.906
- HEY, GUYS.
- AH, THIS IS SOME EVENT.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.974
- I THINK I MIGHT REVISIT
THE HALCYON DAYS

25:42.008 --> 25:44.577
OF MY DEBAUCHED YOUTH
AND DANCE TILL DAWN.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.045
- IF HE MAKES IT TILL 10:30,
IT'LL BE A MIRACLE.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.980
- OH, UH, WHERE'S BRIAN?
I WANT TO THANK HIM.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.682
- HE WENT TO AUSTRALIA
FOR MARDI GRAS.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.050
- FIGURES.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.218
- AFTER ALL, HE'S
SLEPT WITH EVERYONE

25:52.251 --> 25:53.953
ON THIS CONTINENT.
- [laughs]

25:55.121 --> 25:57.590
- I LOVE THE DECORATIONS.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.059
- OH, SHIT!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26:00.092 --> 26:02.862
- MY MOTHER JUST ARRIVED
WITH HER BOY-TOY.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.063
IT'S SO SOAP OPERA,

26:04.096 --> 26:05.331
SO MENOPAUSAL.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.199
IT'S SO HUMILIATING.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.869
- HELLO, DARLING. HMM.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.672
- SOMEHOW SHE SEEMS
TO PERCEIVE IT DIFFERENTLY.

26:12.705 --> 26:13.940
- YOU REMEMBER TUCKER.
- AH, YEAH.

26:13.973 --> 26:14.974
GOOD TO SEE
YOU AGAIN.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.075
- HOW YOU DOING?

26:16.108 --> 26:17.710
HI, JUSTIN.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.746
I'M GONNA GET A DRINK.

26:19.779 --> 26:20.947
UM, CHARDONNAY,
HONEY?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.349
- PERFECT.

26:23.382 --> 26:24.984
ALTHOUGH BY THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE,

26:25.017 --> 26:27.186
I SHOULD'VE ORDERED
A SOUR APPLE MARTINI.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.623
- DID YOU HAVE
TO BRING HIM?

26:30.657 --> 26:32.859
- DOES HE EMBARRASS YOU?
- FRANKLY, YES.

26:32.892 --> 26:36.162
- WELL, WHEN THERE'S
A PROPOSITION 15

26:36.195 --> 26:37.997
TO TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS
OF MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN

26:38.030 --> 26:40.232
TO STILL HAVE A LIFE,

26:40.266 --> 26:41.834
LET'S HOPE YOU
SHOW UP FOR ME.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.970
- MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
EVERYONE.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.137
HI. I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

26:45.171 --> 26:48.374
[cheers and applause]

26:48.407 --> 26:51.744

FORMER QUEER GUY.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.313
BUT TONIGHT I AM

26:54.346 --> 26:58.050
AND I WANT TO WELCOME YOU

26:58.084 --> 26:59.385
[cheers and applause]

26:59.418 --> 27:01.320
- HEY, GUYS,
THIS IS LEWIS.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.255
WE MET ON HUSBANDMATERIAL.COM.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.124
- OHH, THIS SOUNDS SERIOUS.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.727
- MICHAEL AND BEN GOT MARRIED
IN TORONTO LAST YEAR.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.195
- YOU COULD BE NEXT.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.397
- DEFEAT PROPOSITION 14!

27:11.430 --> 27:13.632
[cheers and applause]

27:16.168 --> 27:19.271

27:19.305 --> 27:22.074
AND THE STATE CAPITAL

27:22.108 --> 27:24.944
WE WILL NOT BE SILENT.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
[cheers and applause]

27:27.179 --> 27:30.449
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT'S
FOR THE SILENT AUCTION.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.785
SO GET THOSE BIG BIDS IN EARLY.

27:32.819 --> 27:36.155
AND NOW...
I'M SO EXCITED.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.325
IT IS MY GREAT HONOR
AND PLEASURE

27:39.358 --> 27:41.794
TO PRESENT
OUR STAR ATTRACTION.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.362
A GIRL WHO,

27:43.395 --> 27:46.032
JUST WANTS TO HAVE FUN.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.701

- OKAY, MAN.

29:35.942 --> 29:39.278
- I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.347
- HEY, IS MY FLIGHT ON TIME?

29:41.380 --> 29:45.017
- YES, MR. KINNEY.

29:45.051 --> 29:48.087
- IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO CHANGE 25 TIMES...

29:48.120 --> 29:50.022
- THE SITTER WAS LATE.
DON'T BLAME ME.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.557
- OH, GOD, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
ON TIME. NOT ONCE.

29:51.590 --> 29:52.558
- WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE
TO BE BOTHERED WITH IT

29:52.591 --> 29:55.561
MUCH LONGER, WILL YOU?

29:55.594 --> 29:57.429
- HEY, GIRLS.
- HI, DUSTY.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.898
I THOUGHT YOU
WEREN'T COMING.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.066
- WELL, AT THE LAST MINUTE
I SAID TO MARIE,

30:00.099 --> 30:01.300
"THIS IS TOO
IMPORTANT TO MISS.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.969
ONE OF US HAS TO BE HERE."
SO...

30:03.002 --> 30:04.236
I CAME AND SHE'S AT HOME
WITH THE KIDS.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.371
- THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.173
OUR NEW SITTER
WAS LATE.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.174
- YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS DROP
THEM AT MY PLACE.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.842

TO HAVE TO JUST PUT YOU

36:06.832 --> 36:08.400
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.569
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU

WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

36:13.705 --> 36:15.574

TO LOSE HIM.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.844
AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU,
SO SIT DOWN.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.546
- ALL RIGHT, I'VE ESTABLISHED
AN AIRWAY.

36:22.581 --> 36:27.286
- I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

CAN YOU HEAR ME?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.326

36:34.360 --> 36:35.727

36:35.761 --> 36:37.229
BEFORE WE CAN DO ANYTHING,

36:37.263 --> 36:38.697
HE'S GOING TO NEED
A TRANSFUSION.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.765
- WELL, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

36:39.798 --> 36:40.899
WELL, HE'S AB-NEGATIVE.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.368
WE'RE SHORT ON HIS TYPE,

36:42.401 --> 36:45.371
SO WE'RE CHECKING
OTHER HOSPITALS.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.779
- WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

36:53.812 --> 36:55.514
- YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GIVE BLOOD
BECAUSE OF HIV.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.883
- I DON'T HAVE HIV.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.851
GAYS ARE CONSIDERED
TO BE TOO HIGH OF A RISK.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.920
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE
STRAIGHT STUDS AND BITCHES

37:01.953 --> 37:03.722

37:30.782 --> 37:32.818
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

37:32.851 --> 37:34.520
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING
YOUR FANS NOW THAT YOU'RE GAY?

37:34.553 --> 37:36.355
- RIGHT NOW
I'M MORE CONCERNED

37:36.388 --> 37:37.889
ABOUT PEOPLE
LOSING THEIR LIVES.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.792
EMMETT!

37:49.601 --> 37:52.538
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.081
- WE STABILIZED
THE BLOOD LOSS,

38:03.114 --> 38:04.316
BUT THERE'S STILL
INTERNAL BLEEDING

38:04.350 --> 38:06.718
FROM A PUNCTURED SPLEEN,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.721
SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED
TO REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.959
- WILL HE BE
ALL RIGHT?

38:13.992 --> 38:17.329
- WITH THIS AMOUNT
OF BLOOD LOSS...

38:17.363 --> 38:19.465
WE CAN ONLY HOPE
FOR THE BEST.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.073
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A MOMENT WITH HIM,

38:28.106 --> 38:29.541
AND THEN WE NEED
TO START PREPPING.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.777
OKAY?

38:43.655 --> 38:46.692
- YOU BETTER FUCKING COME
THROUGH THIS, YOU LITTLE SHIT.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.327
[crying]

39:07.746 --> 39:10.048
- I'M AFRAID I WOKE HIM.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.718
BUT I JUST...

39:12.751 --> 39:15.654
NEEDED TO HOLD HIM.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.023
- HE'LL GO BACK TO SLEEP.

39:20.659 --> 39:23.862
- ARE YOU...

39:23.895 --> 39:25.764
WHAT AN IDIOTIC QUESTION.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.803
OF COURSE, YOU'RE
NOT ALL RIGHT.

39:31.837 --> 39:36.007
HOW COULD ANYONE
BE ALL RIGHT?

39:36.041 --> 39:39.010
- JUST GRATEFUL.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.046
GRATEFUL
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS LATE.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.816
- AND THAT YOU FORGOT
YOUR CELL PHONE.

39:44.850 --> 39:49.187
- PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER
BE ON TIME FOR ANYTHING.

39:49.220 --> 39:54.693
- IF YOU PROMISE ME YOU'LL
NEVER REMEMBER A THING.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.667
I'LL PUT HIM BACK IN BED.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.903
- [whimpers]

40:04.936 --> 40:07.539

PLEASE.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.634
[door opens

41:31.790 --> 41:36.662
- AS YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A GOOD CATHOLIC GIRL.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.997
EVEN THOUGH WHEN IT COMES
TO GAYS AND ABORTION,

41:39.030 --> 41:42.033
I THINK THEY'RE
FULL OF SHIT.

41:42.067 --> 41:45.270
BUT STILL, I...

41:45.303 --> 41:48.306
I ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT GOD KNEW BEST

41:48.339 --> 41:53.278
AND THERE WAS A REASON
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.548
BUT, UM...

41:56.582 --> 41:59.217
THIS TIME I'M NOT SO SURE
WHY HE LET THIS HAPPEN

41:59.250 --> 42:02.754
TO MICHAEL AND THE OTHERS.

42:02.788 --> 42:04.823
SO THIS TIME...

42:04.856 --> 42:07.926
I'M NOT ASKING HIM.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.295
I'M TELLING HIM...

42:10.328 --> 42:12.263
TO SEE THAT MICHAEL
GETS THROUGH THIS.

42:17.335 --> 42:21.206
AND NOTICE I DIDN'T SAY,
"MY SON MICHAEL."

42:23.074 --> 42:24.876
BECAUSE IT'S
NOT FOR ME.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.716
IT'S FOR HIM.

42:45.096 --> 42:48.700
YOU WANT TO SAY A PRAYER?

42:48.734 --> 42:51.837
- NO.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.075
[sighs]

42:57.108 --> 42:59.978
BUT IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU,

43:00.011 --> 43:04.683
YOU BETTER FUCKING
LISTEN TO HER.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.752
[clears throat]

43:11.790 --> 43:13.692
- TAKE DOWN THOSE BARRIERS
OVER THERE.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.861
- JUST KEEP BREATHING DEEPLY.

43:15.894 --> 43:18.830
- DO YOU MIND IF I TELL PEOPLE
CYNDI LAUPER SAVED MY LIFE?

43:18.864 --> 43:21.266

[chatter of two-way radio]

43:41.052 --> 43:42.854

TO BE OKAY?

43:42.888 --> 43:45.090
- THEY DON'T KNOW.

43:54.432 --> 43:55.934
- WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED,
I TRIED TO CALL YOU

43:55.967 --> 43:58.403
ON YOUR CELL, BUT...

43:58.436 --> 44:00.638
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.146
- I WAS...

44:08.179 --> 44:12.450
SO FUCKING SCARED.

44:12.483 --> 44:16.021
ALL I COULD THINK WAS...

44:16.054 --> 44:20.125
"PLEASE DON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO HIM."

44:27.933 --> 44:30.001
I LOVE YOU.
