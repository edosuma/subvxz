[typewriter keys]

01:29.176 --> 01:30.851
I’m back, Tim

02:15.898 --> 02:17.917
I’ll be up in a minute, Tim

02:32.735 --> 02:34.409
Morning, my lovely

02:41.565 --> 02:42.668
Did you miss me?

02:46.303 --> 02:48.921
Sorry I was gone longer than expected

02:51.505 --> 02:54.131
It’s been a strange morning

02:57.513 --> 02:59.102
You're looking a bit pale

03:04.627 --> 03:05.718
Mmmm

03:07.587 --> 03:09.517
You seem to have a bit of a temperature

03:11.263 --> 03:12.563
you poor thing

03:14.559 --> 03:15.964
I’m not feeling great either

03:17.771 --> 03:19.766
just so tired

03:22.589 --> 03:24.349
So much to do every day

03:26.935 --> 03:28.213
Still...

03:29.403 --> 03:30.913
No rest for the wicked, hey

03:42.593 --> 03:44.917
My head's been all over the place the last few days

03:47.451 --> 03:48.515
but earlier...

03:49.802 --> 03:51.049
I got the answer

03:55.718 --> 03:58.094
I know you think this is gonna sound strange...

03:58.790 --> 04:01.127
and you’ll most likely think I’ve gone mad, but ...

04:05.581 --> 04:07.170
I felt God...

04:07.761 --> 04:08.969
touch my heart today

04:10.557 --> 04:11.673
Seriously

04:13.236 --> 04:15.547
I felt him right here

04:17.533 --> 04:18.825
Well you know me...

04:20.178 --> 04:22.711
I’m not one to believe this sort of thing usually, but...

04:23.832 --> 04:25.564
God spoke to me

04:27.050 --> 04:30.256
and He told me exactly what to do

04:30.705 --> 04:32.564
Exactly!

04:38.462 --> 04:41.251
I think he felt sorry for me really

04:43.399 --> 04:44.906
because of our...

04:47.374 --> 04:49.457
current situation

05:06.878 --> 05:10.034
I always thought religious people were delusional...

05:11.286 --> 05:12.688
mad...

05:14.792 --> 05:18.398
but it just goes to show you how things can change in an instant

05:21.454 --> 05:23.006
Just like that!

05:30.105 --> 05:32.994
-It’s a bit dark, isn’t it?
-Hmmm

05:33.825 --> 05:36.229
Wonder what that says about the artist

05:36.489 --> 05:39.110
I don’t know. Not my cup of tea

05:39.965 --> 05:42.017
Looks a bit like you in a bad mood!

05:42.137 --> 05:44.145
Oi, you. Shut up

05:44.265 --> 05:48.042
I don’t know. I was hoping to see a nice sculpture or something

05:48.162 --> 05:50.017
Some naked men perhaps?

05:50.137 --> 05:53.402
Isabelle, stop it

05:53.522 --> 05:57.274
Oh, wait up, hunk alert

06:25.965 --> 06:27.631
Interesting picture

06:28.529 --> 06:30.863
Yeah, I like it

06:37.274 --> 06:38.530
I’m Tim by the way

06:38.650 --> 06:39.700
Abbie...

06:40.264 --> 06:41.931
and this is Isabelle...

06:42.051 --> 06:42.777
Oh!

06:55.343 --> 06:56.753
So do you come here often?

06:56.873 --> 06:59.343
No. First time

07:04.121 --> 07:06.076
I’m supposed to be meeting a mate here

07:06.942 --> 07:11.398
Oh, right.
Well, it’s a nice place

07:12.648 --> 07:13.743
Yeah

07:16.540 --> 07:19.874
If I’m honest with you, I don’t really like art very much

07:19.994 --> 07:24.298
I appreciate it, but I can’t paint to save my life

07:25.099 --> 07:26.638
I’m not very creative

07:28.399 --> 07:30.575
How about you, Abbie? Do you paint?

07:30.824 --> 07:35.058
Oh God, no. No. I’m a writer

07:36.496 --> 07:39.558
Well, I hope to be. That’s my ambition

07:42.028 --> 07:44.056
Well, maybe I’ll read one of your books one day

07:44.619 --> 07:45.627
I hope so

07:47.283 --> 07:48.283
Yeah. Me too

07:50.818 --> 07:56.406
So, err. I don’t think my friend’s actually going to turn up. I don’t suppose you fancy having a drink, do you?

07:56.729 --> 07:58.350
Yeah, OK

08:19.625 --> 08:20.897
I need a break

08:28.468 --> 08:30.068
So, you having a good day?

08:30.188 --> 08:32.322
Perfect. How about you?

08:32.357 --> 08:33.682
Yeah, not too bad

08:34.350 --> 08:35.511
Mind you...

08:36.491 --> 08:37.922
You know I can’t swim, right?

08:39.054 --> 08:39.669
No

08:39.744 --> 08:40.282
Yeah

08:40.592 --> 08:41.542
You never said

08:41.749 --> 08:42.573
Did I not?

08:43.644 --> 08:47.214
- Well I can’t. So if I was going to stand up like this...
- No, sit down, sit down!

08:47.448 --> 08:48.445
Sit down!

08:48.600 --> 08:50.944
- Oh my god
- Careful

08:51.127 --> 08:52.485
Careful

08:54.889 --> 08:57.694
Only joking. Of course I can swim

08:58.034 --> 09:00.214
But if I couldn’t and I accidentally fell in...

09:00.500 --> 09:02.412
would you give me the kiss of life and save me?

09:03.091 --> 09:05.664
Hmmm. No

09:06.254 --> 09:07.769
Well that’s nice of you

09:08.734 --> 09:11.807
I would watch you sink to the bottom of the lake

09:12.915 --> 09:14.702
Yeah, but you wouldn’t really though, would you?

09:16.462 --> 09:17.141
No

09:24.235 --> 09:25.915
Besides... if I went in...

09:26.035 --> 09:27.970
I’d make sure you came in with me

09:30.670 --> 09:32.529
And there’d be nothing you could do about it

09:44.684 --> 09:47.579
OK. Lunch.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.592
It’s beautiful here

10:05.092 --> 10:06.111
Yeah

10:07.000 --> 10:09.537
I used to come here a lot when I was a kid

10:09.657 --> 10:10.020
Yeah?

10:10.140 --> 10:12.307
Yeah. Climbing trees

10:13.076 --> 10:14.523
getting myself all muddy

10:19.067 --> 10:20.550
Listen. I’ve got something to ask you

10:22.194 --> 10:24.588
If I make you dinner, are you free on Thursday?

10:24.910 --> 10:26.679
Oh, I can't

10:26.799 --> 10:28.413
I’ve got to meet Isabelle after work

10:28.533 --> 10:31.272
Oh come on. See her another day

10:31.392 --> 10:32.594
I can’t let her down

10:34.515 --> 10:35.194
Please?

10:37.231 --> 10:38.839
Oh come on. Please?

10:39.465 --> 10:40.662
OK, OK

10:40.782 --> 10:43.271
Yeah? Thank you

10:47.415 --> 10:48.523
What is it anyway?

10:49.415 --> 10:51.739
I’m not telling you all my secrets

10:55.367 --> 10:58.637
But it just goes to show you how things can change in an instant

11:00.972 --> 11:02.294
Just like that

11:04.457 --> 11:06.994
I think sometimes when tragedy strikes...

11:07.477 --> 11:09.907
it makes you see things in a different way

11:12.623 --> 11:15.161
I’m never going to take anything for granted anymore

11:16.890 --> 11:19.963
I mean, look at us

11:21.053 --> 11:23.734
That didn’t turn out the way we expected, did it?

11:25.417 --> 11:26.704
You see, Tim...

11:27.579 --> 11:28.598
God...

11:28.902 --> 11:30.385
wants to help us

11:33.870 --> 11:37.140
I think perhaps you should start believing in God too

11:39.392 --> 11:40.857
It might help you

11:55.629 --> 11:57.577
I bought you a bible in town earlier

11:58.971 --> 12:00.222
I’ll bring it up later

12:01.419 --> 12:03.117
Bring you nearer to God

12:04.457 --> 12:06.280
He loves us all no matter what, Tim

12:07.945 --> 12:08.839
and now...

12:10.054 --> 12:12.538
I understand everything

12:14.790 --> 12:16.988
Now it all makes sense

12:20.079 --> 12:22.527
This is fate, Tim

12:23.257 --> 12:25.473
All of this is fate

12:27.974 --> 12:31.066
It’s a big test for both of us

12:36.588 --> 12:37.656
What’s this?

12:38.996 --> 12:40.783
Why don’t you have a look?

12:44.518 --> 12:46.537
Do you know what? Close your eyes

12:46.657 --> 12:48.414
Go on. Close your eyes

12:55.979 --> 12:57.480
Right...

12:59.625 --> 13:01.144
Now you can open them

13:02.913 --> 13:04.539
Oh my god!

13:06.018 --> 13:06.840
Like it?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.359
Are you kidding me?

13:09.538 --> 13:10.718
Like it?

13:11.897 --> 13:13.148
I love it

13:15.700 --> 13:17.173
It’s a pleasure, honey

13:18.692 --> 13:22.855
I thought it was about time you had something to give you more motivation to write

13:24.197 --> 13:25.560
It certainly will

13:26.850 --> 13:28.469
God I don’t know what to say

13:30.301 --> 13:31.491
Well...

13:32.561 --> 13:34.656
I have something else for you aswell

13:36.605 --> 13:37.546
What is it?

13:38.095 --> 13:40.428
I think you should close your eyes again

13:41.013 --> 13:41.704
OK

13:48.296 --> 13:48.854
Open them

13:53.986 --> 13:54.773
Abbie...

13:56.851 --> 13:59.184
I’ve never met anybody quite like you

14:00.090 --> 14:01.727
From the moment I saw you, I just...

14:02.487 --> 14:03.603
I just knew

14:05.161 --> 14:06.877
I want you to live with me

14:07.180 --> 14:08.646
I want you to grow old with me

14:08.932 --> 14:11.022
I want you to have babies with me

14:13.821 --> 14:15.215
I want you to marry me

14:19.861 --> 14:20.719
Will you?

14:21.844 --> 14:23.238
Yes

14:23.774 --> 14:24.936
Yes, of course

14:26.097 --> 14:26.682
OK

14:27.719 --> 14:30.131
Well, we’d better see how this fits then, hadn’t we?

14:54.619 --> 14:56.692
So tell me something...

14:58.264 --> 15:00.837
How has a girl like you never been married before?

15:04.197 --> 15:05.644
Never really found the right man

15:06.470 --> 15:08.629
Well... until now

15:16.458 --> 15:18.370
I was engaged once before

15:18.799 --> 15:19.853
years ago

15:20.621 --> 15:22.498
but he ended up being a total jerk

15:23.641 --> 15:25.821
loved his bands more than he loved me

15:26.857 --> 15:28.126
Well he lost a good woman

15:29.341 --> 15:30.967
Abbie, can you do something for me?

15:31.342 --> 15:32.432
Yeah, sure

15:32.897 --> 15:34.380
I want you to give up work

15:35.077 --> 15:38.187
I want you to be able to concentrate on your writing full time

15:38.982 --> 15:41.519
I don’t want you to worry about money or anything

15:41.764 --> 15:43.431
I make enough for us to get by

15:44.341 --> 15:47.818
Besides, I’ve got some stashed away so after we’re married we can have a holiday

15:50.303 --> 15:52.567
That’s not fair on you paying for everything

15:53.985 --> 15:56.856
I don’t mind working. I’ve always been independent

15:57.471 --> 15:58.511
No, honey

15:59.037 --> 16:00.578
I don’t want you to worry about anything

16:00.698 --> 16:03.014
I want you to be able to just write without any pressures

16:05.954 --> 16:07.084
OK

16:07.473 --> 16:08.239
If you’re sure

16:08.359 --> 16:09.360
Yeah, I’m sure

16:10.297 --> 16:11.418
Besides...

16:11.716 --> 16:13.478
When you’ve sold millions of books

16:13.598 --> 16:15.846
and become this big multi-millionaire writer...

16:15.966 --> 16:17.458
you can look after me. How does that sound?

16:18.471 --> 16:19.127
OK

16:20.083 --> 16:20.774
It’s a deal

18:54.684 --> 18:56.834
Home sweet home Mrs Hemp

18:59.680 --> 19:02.030
It’s going to take me a while to get used to that name

19:02.097 --> 19:03.046
Yeah?

19:05.375 --> 19:07.191
Well, you’d better get used to it!

19:17.175 --> 19:18.940
I’ve got a surprise for you by the way

19:20.236 --> 19:21.867
Oh yeah? What’s that?

19:22.288 --> 19:23.539
I’m pregnant

19:25.984 --> 19:27.436
Are you serious?

19:28.373 --> 19:30.696
I did a test this morning, before we left

19:31.323 --> 19:32.730
You’re going to be a daddy

19:34.887 --> 19:36.161
That’s amazing

19:40.164 --> 19:41.750
God, I love you

19:48.248 --> 19:50.080
I’m going to be a daddy

20:04.126 --> 20:04.953
Sweetheart?

20:05.641 --> 20:06.359
Hi

20:06.479 --> 20:07.214
Hey love. How you doing?

20:07.334 --> 20:07.847
Yeah. Good.

20:08.052 --> 20:08.471
Cool

20:08.798 --> 20:09.815
Err, listen...

20:09.935 --> 20:12.260
I’m going out and have a few drinks, if that’s alright?

20:12.474 --> 20:13.782
with my mate Shawn here

20:14.205 --> 20:15.982
You remember Shawn, he’s the ugly one

20:16.381 --> 20:17.325
Piss off you

20:17.445 --> 20:19.281
[laughter]

20:19.677 --> 20:22.428
Hi. Congratulations on the wedding and baby, Abbie

20:22.611 --> 20:23.400
Thank you

20:23.504 --> 20:24.602
Nice to meet you

20:24.786 --> 20:27.859
Next time I’ll bring my wife. I’m sure she'd love to meet you

20:27.962 --> 20:28.618
Yeah, that’ll be great

20:32.748 --> 20:33.436
OK

20:37.549 --> 20:38.535
I’ll see you later

20:38.764 --> 20:39.391
OK

20:59.673 --> 21:00.924
Shhhh

21:10.554 --> 21:12.296
It's two o'clock in the morning!

21:13.495 --> 21:15.014
Naughty me

21:15.617 --> 21:17.136
What you gonna do about it?

21:20.531 --> 21:22.318
What’s happened to you?

21:22.854 --> 21:25.088
I don’t even know who you are anymore?

21:26.830 --> 21:30.918
I told you ages ago that I had to go out with Shawn and the lads for a drink

21:31.038 --> 21:33.981
OK. He done me a very, very big favour

21:34.741 --> 21:36.148
OK, now...

21:36.268 --> 21:39.677
You knew about this, so stop your moaning, Miss Moany

21:44.122 --> 21:45.262
What’s that?

21:46.579 --> 21:47.629
It was your dinner

21:48.030 --> 21:48.878
Oh!

21:49.521 --> 21:51.666
Do you know how long that took me to cook?

21:54.366 --> 21:58.338
Quit your whining, Miss Whiny Whingy Whiny Person

21:58.458 --> 21:59.672
Alright? OK?

22:00.630 --> 22:01.760
I tell you what. Look...

22:01.880 --> 22:04.147
I’ve had enough of your questions for one night

22:04.351 --> 22:05.905
So I'm going to go to bed

22:06.150 --> 22:08.837
Cos I’ve had enough of your questions for one evening

23:26.411 --> 23:28.349
I’m going to sleep in a bit

23:29.288 --> 23:31.250
Got a big day tomorrow

23:31.546 --> 23:33.435
Don’t want to be too tired

23:34.392 --> 23:36.526
Let’s say a little prayer together, shall we?

23:37.900 --> 23:40.328
You especially need to believe in God more

23:41.506 --> 23:43.959
He might be able to help with your suffering

23:47.295 --> 23:49.625
Everything happens for a reason, Tim

23:50.598 --> 23:53.321
Even if sometimes it is cruel

23:55.185 --> 23:56.755
That’s what I’ve learnt

23:57.981 --> 23:59.502
God taught me that

24:02.446 --> 24:03.476
Come on

24:13.092 --> 24:14.221
Dear Lord...

24:15.006 --> 24:17.729
We thank you for guiding us towards the light

24:18.697 --> 24:20.341
We are your pupils

24:20.684 --> 24:22.009
your children

24:23.285 --> 24:25.934
and we pray that you forgive us our sins

24:29.564 --> 24:30.815
Tim!

24:32.214 --> 24:33.661
Close your eyes

24:34.691 --> 24:36.138
It’s not respectful

24:38.812 --> 24:39.941
That’s better

24:42.076 --> 24:43.081
Sorry

24:47.131 --> 24:50.182
Dear Lord. We thank you for blessing us with life

24:51.002 --> 24:53.891
and showing us the true value of existence

24:55.247 --> 24:55.976
Amen

25:00.372 --> 25:01.188
There!

25:02.180 --> 25:03.863
Doesn’t that feel better?

25:25.452 --> 25:27.122
It’ll be our anniversary next week

25:28.139 --> 25:29.182
Can you believe that?

25:32.497 --> 25:33.904
Doesn’t time fly?

25:54.709 --> 25:57.585
I know I haven’t been exactly how you wanted me to be

25:58.728 --> 26:00.611
As your wife I mean, but...

26:01.641 --> 26:03.915
I did try to please you most of the time

26:06.624 --> 26:08.671
I think I did really well to be honest

26:10.794 --> 26:13.394
I mean, you weren’t easy to cope with

26:14.986 --> 26:17.422
and there is only so much

26:17.661 --> 26:18.980
a person can take

26:27.642 --> 26:29.262
Did you see that, Tim?

26:32.745 --> 26:33.586
You see?

26:34.943 --> 26:36.324
I’m not going mad

26:57.391 --> 26:58.069
Tim

27:00.551 --> 27:03.374
I need to talk to you about something important

27:16.652 --> 27:18.021
I need to go my own way

27:24.740 --> 27:26.637
I can’t cope with you anymore

27:39.615 --> 27:41.197
Let’s get you more comfortable

28:17.449 --> 28:19.195
I did love you, sweetheart

28:22.824 --> 28:25.437
but I just don’t have the same feelings anymore.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.007
Isabelle’s really excited about our good news

28:35.162 --> 28:36.983
She thinks it’s going to be a girl

28:37.398 --> 28:38.566
But I don’t know...

28:39.847 --> 28:41.304
I think it’s going to be a boy

28:44.750 --> 28:47.538
Yeah, maybe... Maybe a boy

28:48.693 --> 28:50.577
Well I’ve not had much sickness

28:51.381 --> 28:55.111
and they say if you get really sick during pregnancy it’s likely to be a girl

28:56.995 --> 28:58.239
Oh! Guess what?

28:59.992 --> 29:02.001
She knows this guy that runs a publishing firm

29:03.094 --> 29:05.216
and she’s been talking to him about my writing

29:06.372 --> 29:09.436
and apparently he’s really interested in looking at my work

29:11.407 --> 29:14.759
I’ve just got to finish the last chapter and then I can send it to him

29:15.954 --> 29:17.327
I hope he likes it

29:20.593 --> 29:22.652
I’m so lucky to have a friend like Isabelle

29:24.600 --> 29:25.869
Yeah, that’s good

29:29.755 --> 29:31.840
Well, fingers crossed

29:32.023 --> 29:33.869
you might be looking at a best-selling author

29:38.269 --> 29:39.550
What about me?

29:40.768 --> 29:41.409
Hmm?

29:41.974 --> 29:43.293
What do you mean?

29:43.983 --> 29:46.018
Well, I thought I was your best friend?

29:46.596 --> 29:47.651
Well of course you are

29:48.181 --> 29:49.462
You’re my husband

29:51.811 --> 29:55.064
What I meant was... Isabelle is my best female friend

30:04.157 --> 30:07.146
So, umm... how was work?

30:08.176 --> 30:09.997
Yeah, it was alright

30:10.117 --> 30:13.175
Look, can we just go home? I’m missing the football results

30:14.971 --> 30:16.290
Yes, sure

30:17.408 --> 30:18.237
Are you okay?

30:19.191 --> 30:23.022
Yeah, I’m OK. Sorry, I’m just tired. Work, you know?

30:24.504 --> 30:27.367
If I’m honest, I can’t wait to have this week off

30:30.181 --> 30:32.642
Can’t remember the last time I had a week off over Christmas

30:33.092 --> 30:34.109
Be great

30:35.717 --> 30:37.400
Mum’s looking forward to it as well

30:39.434 --> 30:41.394
Well, don't forget my sister’s coming Boxing Day

30:43.779 --> 30:46.417
Yeah... I don't think so

30:48.966 --> 30:49.984
What do you mean?

30:50.812 --> 30:52.734
I haven't seen my sister in months!

30:52.854 --> 30:55.836
Look, I just want to have a quiet Christmas, alright? No bother

30:56.992 --> 30:58.838
You always got on alright with her before

31:00.463 --> 31:04.569
She just talks all the time though, you know? Just goes on

31:08.149 --> 31:09.329
It’s my sister, Tim

31:09.907 --> 31:11.779
You can see her another time

31:12.323 --> 31:16.480
Besides... she has these brats with her. Constantly running around, screaming their heads off!

31:18.640 --> 31:20.148
That’s my family!

31:20.537 --> 31:23.677
Don’t ever talk about them like that again! What’s wrong with you?

31:24.581 --> 31:26.801
Don’t embarrass me, Abbie!

31:27.278 --> 31:29.238
Not here, and not now!

31:32.428 --> 31:34.475
Look, this discussion is over

31:40.732 --> 31:41.969
Come on. We’re going

32:03.835 --> 32:05.165
Have you seen my keys Abbie?

32:05.253 --> 32:06.540
No I haven’t

32:07.441 --> 32:09.037
Maybe try your coat pocket?

32:12.440 --> 32:13.746
How are you Abbie?

32:14.977 --> 32:16.836
I’m OK thanks. How are you?

32:17.137 --> 32:18.569
Yeah I’m cool

32:19.122 --> 32:20.918
Just plodding along as usual

32:21.872 --> 32:23.414
Helen says hello by the way

32:23.534 --> 32:26.340
Oh that’s nice. Say hi from me

32:27.558 --> 32:31.050
Look. When you’re done flirting, do you think you can help me look?

32:31.791 --> 32:33.449
Alright buddy, calm down

32:33.989 --> 32:35.634
It’s none of your business, Shawn

32:36.479 --> 32:38.790
Keep checking in here. I’m gonna check the sitting room

32:40.611 --> 32:41.692
What’s rattled his cage?

32:42.659 --> 32:43.714
Sorry about that

32:44.291 --> 32:46.577
Don’t apologize. He’s out of order

32:47.657 --> 32:49.164
I think he’s stressed about work

32:49.513 --> 32:51.259
Having to do the extra hours and all

32:53.092 --> 32:55.391
I think he is feeling the pressure from the new baby, you see

32:59.347 --> 33:01.733
He’ll be ok, don’t worry

33:02.309 --> 33:03.323
Yeah

33:03.681 --> 33:04.799
Maybe

33:05.829 --> 33:06.891
Found ‘em

33:08.303 --> 33:10.564
Do me a favour mate. Go put that in the car would ya?

33:10.684 --> 33:11.710
No problem

33:12.159 --> 33:13.164
See ya later Abbie

33:21.411 --> 33:22.579
Do you think I’m blind?

33:23.918 --> 33:24.835
What?

33:26.208 --> 33:28.745
Trying to make me look like an arsehole in front of my friends

33:29.906 --> 33:30.921
I didn’t

33:32.826 --> 33:33.799
I didn’t

33:36.305 --> 33:38.452
Don’t ever disrespect me again

34:22.547 --> 34:24.719
I’m so sorry for hitting you

34:28.880 --> 34:32.360
I just... I just get so jealous sometimes

34:33.867 --> 34:35.851
And what with work and...

34:36.304 --> 34:37.534
everything

34:45.456 --> 34:46.498
It’s just...

34:46.870 --> 34:49.757
Shawn’s my best friend, alright?

34:50.927 --> 34:52.987
And I’m sure he fancies you

34:54.938 --> 34:57.488
I just took it out on you. I’m sorry

35:04.751 --> 35:07.665
I love you so much

35:09.499 --> 35:13.075
I just get so mad... sometimes...

35:14.771 --> 35:17.835
But you’re my woman. You’re my woman!

35:18.463 --> 35:20.008
Nobody else’s

35:24.815 --> 35:26.322
But I promise you...

35:26.812 --> 35:30.165
I promise you... this will never happen again

35:37.085 --> 35:38.216
I’m so sorry

35:46.539 --> 35:47.543
Sorry

36:18.541 --> 36:19.559
Babe?

36:20.476 --> 36:21.845
I’m just going to work

36:22.768 --> 36:24.740
Ok. See you later

37:17.922 --> 37:19.008
Look...

37:20.220 --> 37:21.261
what I found!

37:22.926 --> 37:24.810
Haven’t we been sneaky?

37:27.686 --> 37:28.829
Now I’m mad!

37:29.985 --> 37:32.484
Really... mad!

37:34.770 --> 37:37.018
They accepted my book for publication

37:38.608 --> 37:40.040
Years ago!

37:41.070 --> 37:42.828
and you knew this!

37:47.249 --> 37:50.025
Did it hurt you to see me doing something successful?

37:50.615 --> 37:51.430
Huh?

37:52.394 --> 37:53.501
What was it?

37:54.717 --> 37:55.857
Jealousy?

37:57.367 --> 37:58.159
Because...

37:58.279 --> 37:59.402
you’re a sad...

37:59.879 --> 38:00.771
little...

38:01.864 --> 38:03.082
mummy’s boy!

38:07.092 --> 38:08.951
And what about these other letters?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.066
from Isabelle?

38:12.518 --> 38:14.176
and my sister?

38:17.353 --> 38:19.112
You made me think...

38:20.100 --> 38:22.173
that I was all alone

38:23.717 --> 38:25.187
That nobody cared

38:37.451 --> 38:39.649
You didn’t ask me to quit my job...

38:39.769 --> 38:41.973
so I could focus on my writing

38:42.538 --> 38:43.527
No

38:45.050 --> 38:45.854
You...

38:46.168 --> 38:48.051
wanted to control me

38:49.111 --> 38:50.354
Trap me

38:53.042 --> 38:54.336
Well...

38:56.031 --> 38:57.387
now I’m in control

38:59.673 --> 39:00.665
and you...

39:01.582 --> 39:02.914
are all alone

39:04.216 --> 39:07.168
No mumsie to help you this time

39:17.087 --> 39:19.310
I was going to make things pain free for you

39:23.404 --> 39:24.560
Not now

39:30.573 --> 39:32.658
I’m not going to give you your meds now

39:35.433 --> 39:37.430
I’m going to make sure...

39:37.958 --> 39:39.377
you feel...

39:40.530 --> 39:41.811
everything!

39:52.098 --> 39:53.919
What’re you doing sleeping out here?

39:55.665 --> 39:56.732
You disgust me!

39:57.448 --> 39:59.194
What the hell are you going on about now?

39:59.483 --> 40:02.824
Aww... My bloody head

40:04.406 --> 40:06.416
Serves you right, you bastard

40:07.953 --> 40:10.076
I know you’re seeing someone else

40:10.905 --> 40:12.349
What the hell are you talking about?

40:15.288 --> 40:17.649
I could smell her perfume on your shirt

40:17.769 --> 40:19.219
It stinks!

40:21.724 --> 40:24.650
You’ve got it all wrong, as usual

40:24.889 --> 40:29.724
I was just dancing with some girl and she was rubbing herself up against me. That’s all

40:30.214 --> 40:32.450
While I’m at home, pregnant with your baby?

40:32.570 --> 40:36.268
And you expect me to hang around here, whilst you get as fat as a whale! I don’t think so

40:39.625 --> 40:41.057
Are you cheating on me?

40:41.923 --> 40:43.003
Tell me!

40:43.656 --> 40:45.565
Just be honest with me

40:46.583 --> 40:48.015
Well, so what if I am?

40:51.431 --> 40:52.787
I’m your wife

40:53.792 --> 40:56.153
and I’m having your child

40:57.146 --> 40:59.482
Why are you treating me so badly?

41:00.311 --> 41:02.634
I’ve never done anything to hurt you!

41:03.526 --> 41:04.606
Now you listen here

41:04.726 --> 41:06.640
I can see whoever the bloody hell I like!

41:07.235 --> 41:09.797
I know you’ve been speaking to Isabelle still

41:10.036 --> 41:13.703
I’ve seen the phone records. I know you’ve been lying

41:13.929 --> 41:16.089
So don’t you ever expect me to listen to you!

41:16.209 --> 41:17.383
Who is she?

41:18.929 --> 41:20.135
Shut up!

41:35.017 --> 41:36.939
Do you even know who you are?

41:37.659 --> 41:38.589
Timmy?

41:40.435 --> 41:41.456
I do

41:43.185 --> 41:44.793
and so does God

41:50.397 --> 41:51.606
He feels my pain

41:55.399 --> 41:56.575
He’s not happy

42:00.690 --> 42:02.652
I mean, it’s unbelievable if you think about it...

42:02.772 --> 42:04.332
I went round the guy’s office...

42:04.452 --> 42:06.483
Walk in, just asked him for a pay rise.

42:06.603 --> 42:09.623
And he turns round and tells me there’s no money in the company kitty

42:09.743 --> 42:10.627
Give me a break!

42:10.747 --> 42:12.438
If you go round that guy’s house...

42:12.558 --> 42:14.274
there’s a new car on that driveway...

42:14.394 --> 42:16.127
What the hell are you wearing?

42:20.319 --> 42:22.344
It's the new dress I bought, for tonight

42:23.144 --> 42:24.652
You said you liked it

42:24.772 --> 42:26.881
You look like a complete slut

42:27.531 --> 42:30.734
You’re way too old and fat to be wearing something like that

42:30.854 --> 42:31.880
Jesus!

42:32.194 --> 42:33.670
Seriously. Go and change

42:34.345 --> 42:36.150
I bought it especially...

42:36.270 --> 42:38.254
Abbie, I’m serious. Go change it!

42:38.374 --> 42:41.048
I'm not going to be seen out with you looking like that

42:44.123 --> 42:45.411
[Tim] Go change it!

42:46.494 --> 42:47.404
[Tim] Go on

43:07.944 --> 43:09.655
Thanks guys, that was lovely

43:10.094 --> 43:11.005
No worries mate

43:12.151 --> 43:14.270
Yeah. Thank you. It was really nice

43:14.631 --> 43:15.793
It’s our pleasure

43:15.913 --> 43:17.755
It was lovely to be over tonight

43:19.702 --> 43:21.445
So, Abbie...

43:21.565 --> 43:23.294
Do you fancy a girl’s night out soon?

43:24.157 --> 43:25.570
Yeah. That’ll be great

43:26.418 --> 43:28.506
I haven’t been on a girlie night out for ages

43:29.071 --> 43:30.939
Well we need to change that then don’t we?

43:34.063 --> 43:34.817
Well...

43:34.937 --> 43:37.178
We’ve got to enjoy it before you become a mum.

43:39.518 --> 43:40.648
So...

43:41.904 --> 43:43.097
are we gonna have kids?

43:43.537 --> 43:45.248
Err, never

43:45.368 --> 43:47.242
You’re enough to cope with

43:47.917 --> 43:49.173
See the abuse I get?

43:51.684 --> 43:53.207
Does anyone want any coffee?

43:53.699 --> 43:56.352
Err... yeah, thanks

43:57.750 --> 43:58.566
Yes please

43:59.618 --> 44:01.078
I’ll take these plates out for ya, love

44:01.198 --> 44:01.910
Thanks

44:13.308 --> 44:15.993
You’ve always got to be centre of attention, haven’t you?

44:16.966 --> 44:18.002
What do you mean?

44:18.122 --> 44:19.164
What do you think I mean?

44:19.284 --> 44:20.671
You, talking all the time

44:20.791 --> 44:24.815
Do you honestly think that Shawn and Helen are interested in your opinions?

44:26.841 --> 44:28.803
I don't think I talk too much

44:30.166 --> 44:32.207
You’ve got verbal diarrhoea, love

44:32.327 --> 44:35.095
One stupid opinion after the next

44:35.215 --> 44:37.356
I was just making conversation

44:39.067 --> 44:43.526
Do you honestly think they are interested about you and your stupid bloody books?

44:45.551 --> 44:47.231
They seemed interested

44:48.591 --> 44:51.715
They're being polite, love. Polite

44:52.578 --> 44:53.143
Honestly...

44:53.263 --> 44:55.875
you are a stupid cow sometimes, you know that?

44:55.995 --> 44:57.837
And you’re not going out with Helen either

44:58.230 --> 45:00.177
You always go out with Shawn

45:01.636 --> 45:03.394
I never get to go out

45:04.525 --> 45:05.122
Yeah

45:05.242 --> 45:07.710
Well I know what women are like when they’re together

45:08.495 --> 45:09.374
D’you know what?

45:09.494 --> 45:11.258
Shawn actually dislikes you

45:11.378 --> 45:12.514
He hates you

45:12.875 --> 45:14.021
and there you are...

45:14.319 --> 45:16.705
giving cow eyes to him in front of his wife!

45:16.825 --> 45:18.118
You’re an embarrassment

45:18.238 --> 45:19.437
I didn’t...

45:19.557 --> 45:21.336
So, Tim...

45:23.048 --> 45:25.949
What was that favour you wanted to ask me about earlier?

45:27.126 --> 45:28.476
Oh

45:29.842 --> 45:32.228
Me and Abbie have got to go off and see my Mum

45:32.348 --> 45:34.646
she’s been a bit under the weather recently

45:34.766 --> 45:35.792
anyway

45:35.912 --> 45:39.733
I’ve got a package being delivered that I’m not going to be around to sign for

45:40.574 --> 45:41.987
It’s really important, mate

45:42.107 --> 45:45.598
and I was just wondering, would you be able to do it for me?

45:45.718 --> 45:46.681
Yeah sure, course I will

45:47.592 --> 45:48.895
Thank you mate

45:49.015 --> 45:49.821
Here...

45:51.673 --> 45:54.154
Here’s the key to the house, okay. Let yourself in.

45:55.944 --> 45:58.298
when I get back, I’ll buy you a couple beers, okay

45:59.815 --> 46:01.150
Here we go then guys

46:04.679 --> 46:05.708
[Abbie] Thank you

46:05.760 --> 46:06.775
[Tim] Cheers

46:09.313 --> 46:11.056
OK. Help yourselves

46:18.299 --> 46:19.351
Abbie?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.580
Are you OK?

46:23.699 --> 46:24.437
Yeah

46:25.693 --> 46:26.871
Yeah sorry

46:27.200 --> 46:28.654
I’m just a bit tired

46:28.774 --> 46:30.152
It's been a long day

46:31.894 --> 46:33.480
We’re great though ain’t we love, eh?

46:34.155 --> 46:34.861
Yeah

47:01.122 --> 47:03.627
Thank you for coming round to cook, Abbie

47:04.349 --> 47:06.275
I’ve been unable to do it myself

47:06.395 --> 47:08.317
I’ve been sick with worry

47:23.109 --> 47:26.649
I haven’t seen you for three weeks, Tim

47:28.013 --> 47:29.537
Yeah I know, sorry Mum

47:29.657 --> 47:31.178
I’ve just been busy at the yard

47:32.579 --> 47:35.138
You need to phone me more at least

47:45.735 --> 47:46.573
Abbie...

47:47.830 --> 47:48.499
I think...

47:48.713 --> 47:50.523
the meat is a little undercooked...

47:50.643 --> 47:52.475
and the vegetables are overcooked

47:52.983 --> 47:55.123
Roasts are a question of ...

47:55.243 --> 47:56.068
timing

47:56.188 --> 47:56.977
my dear

47:57.744 --> 48:00.606
Yeah, she's right you know, darling. This is a little bit chewy

48:05.535 --> 48:06.926
I’ve got an idea

48:07.479 --> 48:09.821
Why can’t you take time out from your busy schedule...

48:09.941 --> 48:11.765
and teach her some domestic skills, eh?

48:12.425 --> 48:14.359
That won't be necessary

48:15.224 --> 48:16.749
But mum’s a better cook than you

48:18.996 --> 48:20.646
I can cook!

48:26.371 --> 48:28.761
Anyway, why are you done up like a dog's dinner?

48:33.369 --> 48:36.213
Just thought I would make a bit of an effort, that’s all

48:37.479 --> 48:38.727
Don’t you like it?

48:40.491 --> 48:42.301
He is right, Abbie

48:42.533 --> 48:45.733
It wasn’t necessary to dress up on my behalf

48:48.390 --> 48:49.683
Anyway, mum...

48:50.824 --> 48:52.284
you’re gonna be a grandmum

48:52.404 --> 48:53.398
That’s good news, isn’t it?

48:53.924 --> 48:55.895
Yes. About time

48:56.376 --> 49:00.370
I was beginning to think Abbie’s bits weren’t working properly “downstairs”

49:07.213 --> 49:10.146
Well we’ve been trying to think up girls’ names anyway

49:10.913 --> 49:12.303
Abbie likes “Samantha”

49:12.972 --> 49:13.757
Umm...

49:15.968 --> 49:16.841
Well...

49:17.334 --> 49:20.481
We’re going to redecorate the spare room into a nursery

49:21.337 --> 49:23.708
Hopefully Barbara will approve

49:26.044 --> 49:27.950
It’s not easy being a mum

49:28.378 --> 49:30.232
It’s a tough job

49:30.740 --> 49:32.193
You do know that?

49:34.814 --> 49:36.259
No I didn’t, Barbara

49:36.452 --> 49:37.852
Is it really?

49:38.761 --> 49:40.732
Now calm down girls, alright?

49:41.177 --> 49:43.121
This is supposed to be a happy occasion

49:53.046 --> 49:53.653
Mum?

49:54.812 --> 49:55.659
Oh my god. Mum?

49:56.042 --> 49:56.550
Mum!

50:22.088 --> 50:25.545
If your father was here he would be very proud, Tim

50:27.587 --> 50:30.583
You remind me so much of your father

50:30.703 --> 50:32.321
He was a great dad

50:32.910 --> 50:35.183
He was hardworking and handsome

50:35.303 --> 50:36.788
just like you

50:37.724 --> 50:38.633
Do you know...

50:38.753 --> 50:42.212
one year he did three jobs just so we could pay the bills

50:42.613 --> 50:44.699
He never gave up on us

50:45.234 --> 50:48.524
Nowadays they don’t know the meaning of hard work

51:44.109 --> 51:48.848
Well it's none of my business, but perhaps it's you putting pressure on him

51:49.942 --> 51:53.249
You're not helping him financially, are you?

51:55.229 --> 51:59.916
You've got to understand - he'll have another mouth to feed soon

52:19.044 --> 52:21.205
[Mother's voice] You're not helping him

52:21.674 --> 52:23.653
[Mother's voice] Perhaps it's you

52:50.294 --> 52:52.481
Please, please Abbie

52:56.188 --> 52:59.443
Please Abbie. I'm so sorry

53:47.380 --> 53:48.932


54:00.019 --> 54:03.148
Who is interrupting us now?

54:23.480 --> 54:25.272
Who is it, please?

54:25.758 --> 54:27.844
Are you okay in there?

54:36.723 --> 54:37.740
Hello

54:38.489 --> 54:39.960
Are you okay, Abbie?

54:41.003 --> 54:43.089
Yeah, I’m fine. Come in

54:43.811 --> 54:44.854
Good, good

54:46.200 --> 54:47.894
We haven’t seen Tim in ages

54:48.822 --> 54:50.515
Manager keeps asking about him

54:50.635 --> 54:52.523
I told him I ain’t seen him all week

54:52.995 --> 54:55.304
You don’t know when he’ll be back in work?

54:56.267 --> 54:56.981
No

54:58.487 --> 54:59.325
He won’t

55:00.600 --> 55:02.009
Not for a while

55:03.311 --> 55:05.478
I don’t know, to be honest with you Shawn

55:06.236 --> 55:08.117
He’s not very well

55:08.473 --> 55:10.185
He’s been in bed all week

55:10.896 --> 55:11.770
Oh. Right

55:11.890 --> 55:12.572
And...

55:13.731 --> 55:16.031
you didn’t call the manager and let him know?

55:16.290 --> 55:17.805
Didn’t think about it really

55:18.545 --> 55:20.730
Just had so much going on

55:21.498 --> 55:23.692
He’s really not very well, you see

55:24.298 --> 55:26.339
Are you sure everything is okay?

55:27.801 --> 55:29.130
You look terrible

55:29.250 --> 55:30.164
Thanks!

55:30.387 --> 55:30.940
No

55:31.972 --> 55:33.416
I didn’t mean to sound rude

55:33.536 --> 55:34.254
I mean ...

55:34.842 --> 55:36.189
I mean you look tired

55:36.697 --> 55:38.105
No, I’m okay

55:39.328 --> 55:41.486
I’m sure he’d be happy to see me

55:42.056 --> 55:43.242
Might even cheer him up

55:43.830 --> 55:44.731
Is he upstairs?

55:44.851 --> 55:45.088
No!

55:48.091 --> 55:50.659
I’m sorry Shawn. I lied to you

55:53.844 --> 55:54.860
He left

55:56.092 --> 55:58.725
But it’s okay... I’m happy

55:59.491 --> 56:00.633
In fact...

56:01.633 --> 56:03.542
I couldn’t be happier

56:08.180 --> 56:11.092
We really weren’t getting on very well, you see

56:12.373 --> 56:14.686
He’s got a terrible temper

56:17.342 --> 56:21.786
I tried my best to make it work, but... no

56:22.900 --> 56:24.405
I lost that...

56:26.466 --> 56:28.500
attraction for him

56:29.210 --> 56:33.417
I lost that... spark, you could say

56:40.968 --> 56:44.186
You don’t know where he went?

56:45.885 --> 56:46.721
No

56:47.919 --> 56:51.513
Not a clue. He left about three days ago

56:52.485 --> 56:55.271
He just left? Without saying anything?

56:55.391 --> 56:56.469
Nothing

56:57.152 --> 56:58.531
Not a word

56:58.893 --> 57:00.300
Oh, I see

57:01.164 --> 57:02.306
Like I said...

57:03.536 --> 57:05.654
I’ve never been happier

57:06.490 --> 57:08.147
I'd better go

57:09.025 --> 57:10.878
I’m sorry about you and Tim

57:11.295 --> 57:12.772
I think that's best

57:16.408 --> 57:20.113
That’s Tim’s wallet. Why would he leave without taking that?

57:20.233 --> 57:21.741
D’you know what, Shawn?

57:22.980 --> 57:24.610
I've always fancied you

57:24.730 --> 57:29.137
What? I'm happily married. You know that.
Come on, Shawn...

57:29.257 --> 57:30.809
I've seen the way you look at me!

57:31.288 --> 57:33.935
Stop it! We mustn't!

57:34.798 --> 57:36.693
Don’t you like me?

57:36.813 --> 57:39.131
Yes, but not like that

57:40.900 --> 57:42.822
Don't you find me attractive?

57:42.942 --> 57:44.082
It's not that.

57:44.202 --> 57:46.575
I'm happily married and Tim’s my best mate.

57:48.052 --> 57:49.027
Look...

57:49.932 --> 57:52.328
I’m going. I’m sorry Abbie...

57:52.448 --> 57:54.334
this isn’t right!

58:43.770 --> 58:45.321
Hmm

58:47.225 --> 58:50.382
Looks like the meds are wearing off fast.

58:54.653 --> 58:57.184
Be time for you to say goodbye soon

59:10.407 --> 59:11.631
Where have you been?

59:11.751 --> 59:15.086
Just out for a walk. Get some fresh air

59:19.840 --> 59:22.506
I’ve been thinking everything through

59:24.138 --> 59:26.097
I’m not happy, Tim

59:29.335 --> 59:32.954
I bought you flowers. They’re your favourites

59:33.552 --> 59:36.545
I don’t want your fucking flowers!

59:37.062 --> 59:41.361
I want you to treat me like a wife should be treated

59:41.481 --> 59:46.014
Hold on a second here. Just calm down. I’m just trying to make things right

59:46.134 --> 59:47.129
Right?

59:48.462 --> 59:51.591
Things haven’t been right in ages!

59:52.377 --> 59:56.186
I am sick to death of living like this

59:56.306 --> 59:58.744
You treat me like shit

59:59.696 --> 1:00:01.655
You insult me

1:00:03.750 --> 1:00:06.199
You’re making me ill

1:00:08.185 --> 1:00:11.885
And all of this strain is most likely having an effect on our baby

1:00:12.239 --> 1:00:13.895
Stop talking to me like this

1:00:13.963 --> 1:00:14.853
Get off me!

1:00:27.308 --> 1:00:29.279
I bought these flowers for you...

1:00:29.564 --> 1:00:31.788
and you’re going to fucking take them!

1:01:15.893 --> 1:01:17.160
Come on

1:01:19.395 --> 1:01:20.063
It’s alright

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:22.668
Up you come

1:01:30.051 --> 1:01:31.464
Shhhh

1:01:32.592 --> 1:01:33.679
It’s OK

1:01:37.036 --> 1:01:40.045
You make me do this to you

1:01:47.371 --> 1:01:48.667
Come on

1:01:50.352 --> 1:01:52.456
It’s alright. Take it easy

1:02:03.751 --> 1:02:04.768
Look at me

1:02:07.442 --> 1:02:09.058
Now, next time...

1:02:09.178 --> 1:02:11.106
I get you flowers...

1:02:11.900 --> 1:02:14.184
all you’ve got to do is be grateful

1:02:15.327 --> 1:02:16.218
Hmm?

1:02:20.161 --> 1:02:21.219
Good girl

1:02:48.627 --> 1:02:49.685
Shit!

1:02:58.619 --> 1:03:00.458
Ti... Tim!

1:03:04.734 --> 1:03:05.528
Tim!

1:03:06.754 --> 1:03:07.827
Tim!

1:04:11.823 --> 1:04:13.398
Come on. In you come

1:04:30.247 --> 1:04:32.609
You did well not to tell the doctors anything

1:04:33.710 --> 1:04:35.312
Would’ve made matters worse

1:04:38.112 --> 1:04:41.107
It wasn’t my fault we lost the baby

1:04:48.212 --> 1:04:50.079
I’m going to make you a cup of tea

1:05:18.257 --> 1:05:21.080
Look, it’s been three weeks now Abbie

1:05:21.862 --> 1:05:25.093
You can’t keep moping around the house, darling

1:05:25.569 --> 1:05:29.378
You haven’t eaten. You’re going to make yourself ill

1:05:37.609 --> 1:05:40.466
Why don’t you do some typing, eh?

1:05:40.586 --> 1:05:43.629
You haven’t written anything in ages

1:06:02.186 --> 1:06:05.111
Look, I’m sorry, OK?

1:06:07.185 --> 1:06:11.607
It was... It was just a bad accident

1:06:19.225 --> 1:06:23.272
We can move on from this. We can

1:06:23.392 --> 1:06:26.946
Just you and me. You and me against the world!

1:06:27.066 --> 1:06:29.020
Hey love?

1:06:38.265 --> 1:06:41.292
Look I’ll call the doctor tomorrow

1:06:41.836 --> 1:06:44.507
I’ll get him to come around. He can give you something

1:06:44.627 --> 1:06:46.359
Make you feel better

1:06:47.112 --> 1:06:50.199
Just... just don’t say anything, okay?

1:06:50.548 --> 1:06:52.086
We don’t want to make matters worse

1:07:24.856 --> 1:07:26.750
Thanks for coming, doc

1:07:28.448 --> 1:07:30.537
Ever since the miscarriage she doesn’t eat...

1:07:30.657 --> 1:07:31.996
She won’t talk to me...

1:07:32.475 --> 1:07:35.283
Lies there on the couch and just does nothing

1:07:35.914 --> 1:07:38.047
Do you mind if I talk to your wife alone?

1:07:38.167 --> 1:07:40.920
It might be easier for her to communicate

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:43.845
She has been through a very traumatic experience

1:07:43.965 --> 1:07:46.708
I’d kind of like to be here for support

1:07:46.828 --> 1:07:49.439
I understand your concern, Mr Hemp, but...

1:07:49.559 --> 1:07:52.563
I would rather see her on my own, if that’s ok

1:07:56.111 --> 1:07:57.548
Yeah, errr...

1:07:58.048 --> 1:07:59.790
Yeah, of course

1:08:00.138 --> 1:08:01.749
I’ll be in the other room then

1:08:15.134 --> 1:08:16.375
Hello Abbie

1:08:16.897 --> 1:08:18.725
My name’s Dr Ribbon

1:08:19.182 --> 1:08:22.969
Your husband got in touch with me because he’s concerned about you

1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:27.193
He says you haven’t been looking after yourself since the loss of the baby

1:08:27.563 --> 1:08:29.282
How are you feeling?

1:08:32.787 --> 1:08:34.550
Can you talk about it?

1:08:39.688 --> 1:08:40.862
Samantha

1:08:42.387 --> 1:08:43.800
That’s her name

1:08:43.921 --> 1:08:45.477
That’s a lovely name

1:08:46.305 --> 1:08:49.024
Abbie, when was the last time you ate?

1:08:54.271 --> 1:08:55.643
The coffin...

1:08:56.905 --> 1:08:58.799
It was so tiny

1:09:03.237 --> 1:09:06.046
I’m just going to take your blood pressure

1:09:06.166 --> 1:09:08.417
Don’t be frightened, it’s ok

1:09:08.538 --> 1:09:09.790
It won’t take long

1:09:13.055 --> 1:09:15.122
I just want to be left alone

1:09:18.562 --> 1:09:19.845
Sit up

1:09:21.696 --> 1:09:23.046
It won’t take long

1:09:25.026 --> 1:09:26.071
Right

1:09:35.425 --> 1:09:38.386
Pop these on here, so we can hear what’s going on

1:09:53.557 --> 1:09:58.041
Your blood pressure is a little high but that is to be expected

1:09:58.346 --> 1:10:01.067
You are going through a very traumatic time

1:10:05.028 --> 1:10:09.208
I would like to refer you to an outside organisation that may help

1:10:10.469 --> 1:10:12.821
We’ve got to get you better, Abbie

1:10:14.148 --> 1:10:17.893
A lot of women in your situation have found it to be very helpful

1:10:22.959 --> 1:10:27.487
In the meantime, I can write you a prescription for some tablets...

1:10:27.607 --> 1:10:30.099
that will help ease your stress a little

1:10:32.646 --> 1:10:35.475
I just want it all to end

1:10:36.743 --> 1:10:40.466
You really are very lucky to have such a supportive husband

1:10:40.585 --> 1:10:42.838
You should try and talk to him

1:10:42.958 --> 1:10:45.450
I can see he loves you

1:10:54.135 --> 1:10:56.159
Is everything ok?

1:11:09.252 --> 1:11:11.233
Look after yourself, Abbie

1:11:20.005 --> 1:11:21.224
Is she going to be alright?

1:11:21.746 --> 1:11:26.339
She’s suffering stress from the loss of the baby. But she’ll be ok in time

1:11:26.459 --> 1:11:29.245
I’ve written a prescription for diazepam

1:11:29.365 --> 1:11:31.094
Should help calm her down

1:11:31.215 --> 1:11:34.948
If you could pick it up as soon as possible, that would be great

1:11:35.710 --> 1:11:38.255
Yeah. Yeah of course

1:11:39.715 --> 1:11:41.521
She needs a lot of rest...

1:11:41.641 --> 1:11:43.741
and tender loving care

1:11:47.702 --> 1:11:49.531
Has she said anything?

1:11:52.268 --> 1:11:55.424
She’s very vulnerable at the moment

1:11:56.099 --> 1:11:58.166
You need to be there for her

1:11:58.287 --> 1:12:00.083
One hundred percent

1:12:00.779 --> 1:12:02.803
Look after her, Mr Hemp

1:12:04.602 --> 1:12:05.707
Yes of course

1:12:06.777 --> 1:12:08.818
Just glad she’s ok

1:12:23.074 --> 1:12:26.746
[sound of typewriter keys]

1:12:55.924 --> 1:12:59.460
Do you realise that you haven't shagged me in ages, woman?

1:13:06.155 --> 1:13:08.005
What’s this? What are you writing?

1:13:10.484 --> 1:13:12.449
Get off Tim, it’s not finished yet

1:13:12.568 --> 1:13:13.916
Whoah, whoah, whoah!

1:13:14.321 --> 1:13:14.835
Uhh

1:13:16.168 --> 1:13:17.147
What is this?

1:13:19.162 --> 1:13:21.851
“Bethan ran down to meet Massimo”

1:13:22.157 --> 1:13:23.777
“She leapt on the back of the bike...”

1:13:23.897 --> 1:13:26.277
“seconds later they were roaring...”

1:13:26.397 --> 1:13:26.891
Stop it!

1:13:27.011 --> 1:13:28.253
“...down the open road”

1:13:29.864 --> 1:13:32.833
“This was the first time Bethan had been on a motorbike”

1:13:33.281 --> 1:13:34.556
“...and it seemed to her...”

1:13:34.806 --> 1:13:38.443
- “...that it was one of the best things she had ever experienced.”
- Tim, stop it!

1:13:40.413 --> 1:13:40.957
Ooh!

1:13:41.351 --> 1:13:45.219
“Bethan enjoyed the sensation of freedom the bike gave her.”

1:13:45.568 --> 1:13:48.109
“And a warm breeze ruffled her hair”

1:13:49.696 --> 1:13:51.771
“...caressed her skin”

1:13:55.746 --> 1:13:57.325
Why won’t you just leave me alone?

1:13:59.012 --> 1:14:00.019
Ah ha

1:14:00.804 --> 1:14:02.355
I’m not hurting you

1:14:04.031 --> 1:14:06.857
This is the only time I have to myself

1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:10.207
It’s all I’ve got

1:14:11.518 --> 1:14:13.014
Well, let me tell you something

1:14:14.005 --> 1:14:15.253
Because this shit...

1:14:15.373 --> 1:14:17.366
doesn’t put money in our pockets

1:14:17.589 --> 1:14:19.800
Well you wouldn’t let me work!

1:14:21.125 --> 1:14:25.609
You were supposed to take care of me. Remember?

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:31.160
Why does it bother you so much?

1:14:32.030 --> 1:14:34.228
Me doing the things I like

1:14:34.969 --> 1:14:38.147
Why can’t you be supportive?

1:14:39.213 --> 1:14:41.260
Encouraging

1:14:42.746 --> 1:14:47.666
Why does everything have to be about you, you, you?

1:14:47.787 --> 1:14:49.701
Be careful, Abbie

1:14:50.954 --> 1:14:52.306
Do you know what, Tim?

1:14:54.005 --> 1:14:55.565
I don’t even care

1:14:57.255 --> 1:15:00.070
Do what you want!

1:15:01.491 --> 1:15:03.581
You’ve broken me already

1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.021
- Cheers, mate
- Cheers!

1:15:59.239 --> 1:16:01.880
So yeah. I was a bit of an arse to buy this place, wasn’t I?

1:16:02.236 --> 1:16:04.465
Well, I didn’t want to say anything mate

1:16:06.103 --> 1:16:09.814
Well, that’s alright. You’re going to do all the plastering and painting. Everything’s up to you

1:16:10.329 --> 1:16:12.702
I’m paying you. I’m going to sit there and do nothing.

1:16:12.915 --> 1:16:15.121
[they laugh]

1:16:15.511 --> 1:16:17.148
- Do you know how long it’s going to take?
- Yeah

1:16:17.428 --> 1:16:19.802
I’m the one that bought the place

1:16:23.052 --> 1:16:23.864
I’d better go

1:16:23.984 --> 1:16:26.057
Alright mate. Take it easy

1:16:26.177 --> 1:16:27.180
See you later

1:16:36.555 --> 1:16:39.077
Why do you have to look so fucking miserable all the time?

1:16:39.505 --> 1:16:40.130
Uhh?

1:16:40.487 --> 1:16:43.188
Why can’t you actually make an effort for me? Just once

1:16:44.632 --> 1:16:46.549
Look at you. Look what you’re wearing

1:16:46.876 --> 1:16:49.221
What’s this? Eh? What’s this?

1:16:49.746 --> 1:16:52.974
For once in your life can you make an effort for me? I’m your husband

1:16:53.252 --> 1:16:55.508
And you wonder why I look at other women

1:16:56.052 --> 1:16:58.450
No, you’re not going anywhere. I’m trying to give you advice, here

1:16:58.664 --> 1:17:01.971
It’s these fucking tablets that you’re taking. They’re messing with your head

1:17:02.388 --> 1:17:03.993
And I’m sick to death

1:17:04.112 --> 1:17:06.293
of seeing you wander all around the house

1:17:06.413 --> 1:17:10.207
bitching and whining and crying “Oh I lost the baby”

1:17:10.483 --> 1:17:12.382
It’s fucking attention seeking

1:17:13.084 --> 1:17:14.947
You caused it!

1:17:15.067 --> 1:17:16.713
After you hit me

1:17:16.833 --> 1:17:19.013
You killed our baby, not me

1:17:20.147 --> 1:17:22.724
No. Don’t you ever fucking say that to me again!

1:17:22.929 --> 1:17:27.725
I don’t go to work every single day to come back to this... this shit!

1:17:27.844 --> 1:17:29.867
I pay the fucking bills around here, not you

1:17:29.987 --> 1:17:34.431
You lost our baby and I’m gonna fucking well make sure that you give me another

1:17:34.735 --> 1:17:36.474
Get on that fucking table

1:17:36.594 --> 1:17:41.466
If I have to fuck you every day, you’re giving me another fucking baby. Do you understand?

1:17:41.585 --> 1:17:42.278
Stop!

1:17:42.398 --> 1:17:45.674
Please, please, please stop

1:17:45.794 --> 1:17:46.755
Please don’t

1:17:46.875 --> 1:17:48.699
Do you understand me?

1:17:51.224 --> 1:17:52.855
[Abbie cries in pain]

1:17:53.364 --> 1:17:55.271
You’re giving me a fucking baby!

1:19:36.375 --> 1:19:39.852
[Tim snoring]

1:20:23.446 --> 1:20:27.298
Girl's voice "Mummy, save me"

1:20:59.394 --> 1:21:02.657
[a woman crying]

1:21:06.002 --> 1:21:07.981
You killed our baby

1:21:11.592 --> 1:21:13.803
[A sinister laugh]

1:21:17.330 --> 1:21:19.300
No!

1:21:35.297 --> 1:21:36.393
Is my lunch in there?

1:21:36.513 --> 1:21:37.730
Yeah. It’s all packed

1:21:42.438 --> 1:21:43.543
What’s the matter?

1:21:44.083 --> 1:21:45.474
Nothing

1:21:46.695 --> 1:21:48.264
Nothing. I’m fine

1:21:50.476 --> 1:21:51.697
Have a good day

1:21:54.896 --> 1:21:56.046
I’ll see you at six

1:21:56.857 --> 1:21:58.559
Clean yourself up. You look a state

1:23:09.859 --> 1:23:10.822
[Abbie screams]

1:23:13.772 --> 1:23:15.992
[Tim tuts]

1:23:16.112 --> 1:23:18.228
Stupid, stupid

1:23:19.993 --> 1:23:21.875
Do you think you can leave me?

1:23:21.995 --> 1:23:24.683
You honestly think you could leave me?

1:23:24.934 --> 1:23:27.511
Huh? Is that what you were trying to do?

1:23:27.630 --> 1:23:28.848
If I can’t have you then no one can have you

1:23:38.684 --> 1:23:41.547
Huh? Don’t you ever try to fucking leave me.

1:23:41.666 --> 1:23:44.934
I will not let you leave me for anybody

1:23:45.054 --> 1:23:47.210
You are mine! Do you understand?

1:23:47.330 --> 1:23:50.473
You can understand. Say yes. Go on, say yes

1:23:50.593 --> 1:23:52.858
- Say yes, you can't leave
- Yes. Yes
- Yeah, yeah!

1:23:52.978 --> 1:23:54.623
Come on. Keep struggling

1:23:54.743 --> 1:23:55.737
Show me you can struggle

1:23:55.858 --> 1:23:58.296
Show me. You don’t have the fucking strength

1:23:58.416 --> 1:24:00.267
Come on. You don’t, do you?

1:24:00.795 --> 1:24:01.731
No, you don’t

1:24:01.954 --> 1:24:05.868
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

1:24:05.987 --> 1:24:09.835
[They both pant for breath]

1:24:21.556 --> 1:24:22.760
[Abbie moans]

1:24:23.411 --> 1:24:26.558
Hey! Afternoon

1:24:26.678 --> 1:24:28.359
[Abbie coughs]
Ahhhh

1:24:28.662 --> 1:24:30.971
It appears we had a little accident

1:24:33.094 --> 1:24:36.510
Don’t worry, sweetie. Everything will be alright

1:24:38.409 --> 1:24:40.181
You think I’m stupid?

1:24:40.484 --> 1:24:41.206
Hmm?

1:24:41.786 --> 1:24:44.023
You think I can’t read you like a book?

1:24:44.951 --> 1:24:46.894
You think I don’t know what you were doing?

1:24:47.438 --> 1:24:48.240
Hmm?

1:24:49.843 --> 1:24:52.954
You were lucky I didn’t kill you

1:24:53.702 --> 1:24:56.485
The next time you might not be so lucky

1:25:04.037 --> 1:25:06.721
Just where the hell do you think you were going anyway?

1:25:07.067 --> 1:25:07.816
Huh?

1:25:08.253 --> 1:25:10.152
You've got no friends

1:25:10.527 --> 1:25:13.629
Your family don’t even want to know about you these days

1:25:15.883 --> 1:25:17.552
[Tim chuckles]

1:25:18.798 --> 1:25:22.943
Have you ever stopped to wonder why it is that everybody rejects you?

1:25:23.264 --> 1:25:24.968
Everybody abandons you

1:25:25.284 --> 1:25:26.255
[Abbie sniffs]

1:25:26.639 --> 1:25:28.833
No. You probably haven’t, have you?

1:25:30.402 --> 1:25:32.273
My mother was right about you, you know

1:25:32.394 --> 1:25:34.035
You really are just a ...

1:25:34.686 --> 1:25:36.202
pathetic...

1:25:36.532 --> 1:25:39.242
poor little excuse for a woman

1:25:40.989 --> 1:25:42.701
Sorry, but it’s the truth honey

1:25:43.521 --> 1:25:45.055
[Abbie cries]

1:25:46.514 --> 1:25:49.412
The other night I was doing you such a big favour you know?

1:25:49.532 --> 1:25:50.749
Shagging you

1:25:51.348 --> 1:25:55.690
Cos the state you’re in at the moment, nobody else would touch you with a barge pole

1:25:58.538 --> 1:26:02.282
Now I want you to listen to me, and I want you to listen to me good...

1:26:03.281 --> 1:26:04.530
You’re mine

1:26:05.216 --> 1:26:07.641
You belong to me

1:26:08.423 --> 1:26:09.698
Nobody else

1:26:10.197 --> 1:26:14.664
And if you ever, ever, try to pull a stunt like that again...

1:26:16.411 --> 1:26:19.701
I will fucking kill you!

1:26:21.404 --> 1:26:22.509
You understand me?

1:26:22.629 --> 1:26:24.355
Yeah? Getting through?

1:26:24.952 --> 1:26:25.692
Good

1:26:26.251 --> 1:26:28.712
Now, I don’t know about you...

1:26:28.832 --> 1:26:30.379
but I’m gonna go and get changed

1:26:30.718 --> 1:26:32.448
We’re in a bit of a state

1:27:03.249 --> 1:27:04.612
[Girl's voice] Are you there?

1:27:06.529 --> 1:27:08.044
[Girl's voice] Are you there?

1:27:10.202 --> 1:27:11.994
[Girl's voice] It’s me, Mummy

1:27:13.590 --> 1:27:15.088
Samantha?

1:27:16.818 --> 1:27:18.326
Is that you?

1:27:20.359 --> 1:27:21.741
[Girl's voice] Yes, Mummy

1:27:21.995 --> 1:27:23.707
[Girl's voice] Why did I die?

1:27:29.192 --> 1:27:30.868
Please forgive me

1:27:32.878 --> 1:27:35.250
I was too frightened to leave daddy

1:27:39.534 --> 1:27:41.425
[Girl's voice] Daddy killed me, Mummy...

1:27:41.637 --> 1:27:44.383
[Girl's voice] Hurt you and took away your dreams

1:27:44.971 --> 1:27:46.638
[Girl's voice] Remember the letters

1:27:47.984 --> 1:27:49.535
What letters?

1:27:49.812 --> 1:27:51.023
[Sound of static]

1:27:51.522 --> 1:27:52.689
Samantha?

1:27:53.135 --> 1:27:54.642
Samantha?

1:27:55.862 --> 1:27:57.227
Don’t go

1:27:59.769 --> 1:28:00.901
Please!

1:28:17.732 --> 1:28:19.507
[Girl's voice] Do it mummy

1:28:28.611 --> 1:28:29.521
Yes

1:28:53.260 --> 1:28:55.614
[kettle boiling]

1:28:59.564 --> 1:29:01.702
[Tim snoring]

1:30:22.621 --> 1:30:24.021
It’s time

1:30:27.275 --> 1:30:28.870
You hurt me too much, Tim

1:30:31.481 --> 1:30:33.798
All I ever did was look after you

1:30:44.094 --> 1:30:46.751
[Tim pants and gasps]

1:31:01.767 --> 1:31:06.733
[Abbie hums]

1:31:24.994 --> 1:31:27.677
I can't cope with you around anymore

1:31:29.398 --> 1:31:31.288
You disgust me!

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:34.998
See?

1:31:36.505 --> 1:31:38.707
I’m not as weak as you thought I was

1:31:39.429 --> 1:31:40.419
Am I?

1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:41.532
No

1:31:46.832 --> 1:31:48.811
The years I suffered...

1:31:49.541 --> 1:31:51.869
with you treating me like an animal

1:31:53.489 --> 1:31:55.985
To be your little dog

1:31:57.421 --> 1:31:58.366
Woof!

1:31:58.972 --> 1:31:59.712
Woof!

1:32:00.344 --> 1:32:01.138
Woof!

1:32:02.037 --> 1:32:03.017
Abbie...

1:32:03.137 --> 1:32:03.820
Please...

1:32:04.087 --> 1:32:04.889
Please...

1:32:05.009 --> 1:32:06.592
Did you really think..

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:08.491
I was gonna put up with this forever?

1:32:10.212 --> 1:32:11.505
The beatings...

1:32:12.049 --> 1:32:13.663
the mental abuse...

1:32:15.401 --> 1:32:17.184
Killing our child!

1:32:17.478 --> 1:32:20.679
Please Abbie...

1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:22.534
I’m so sorry

1:32:25.500 --> 1:32:27.068
But I need you...

1:32:27.818 --> 1:32:30.707
...to understand my pain

1:32:33.901 --> 1:32:37.146
I need you to feel my suffering

1:32:44.992 --> 1:32:46.971
[Tim tries to speak]

1:32:49.226 --> 1:32:50.457
Like you always say...

1:32:53.291 --> 1:32:55.208
“You made me do this”

1:32:55.503 --> 1:32:56.706
No no no no!

1:32:56.826 --> 1:32:59.611
[Tim screams in pain]

1:34:58.898 --> 1:35:03.009
[the fire crackles]

1:36:30.356 --> 1:36:31.746
[the door slams shut]

1:36:51.735 --> 1:36:55.516
[the sound of typewriter keys]

1:37:21.853 --> 1:37:23.290
Are you OK, Abbie?

1:37:25.759 --> 1:37:27.327
I’ve finished my new book

1:37:28.068 --> 1:37:29.307
I did it

1:37:30.922 --> 1:37:31.956
Would you like to read it?

1:37:32.076 --> 1:37:34.737
Maybe later, Abbie, but you have a visitor

1:37:36.423 --> 1:37:37.207
Really?

1:37:37.653 --> 1:37:39.231
It’s your husband, Abbie

1:37:39.481 --> 1:37:41.085
He’s come to visit you

1:38:03.318 --> 1:38:04.987
It’s been a while, Abbie

1:38:10.273 --> 1:38:12.200
Look, I bought you flowers

1:38:13.139 --> 1:38:14.781
They’re your favourites.

1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:18.769
[Abbie whimpers]

1:38:25.495 --> 1:38:27.644
Are you taking your medication?

1:38:29.903 --> 1:38:32.514
I worry about you

1:38:34.675 --> 1:38:36.985
The house is so lonely without you

1:38:47.369 --> 1:38:48.831
Look. I’m sorry, ok?

1:38:50.177 --> 1:38:53.155
I wish I could bring you home with me.

1:38:55.448 --> 1:38:57.525
But I can’t. You just...

1:38:57.818 --> 1:39:00.307
you’re just too dangerous to live with right now

1:39:10.771 --> 1:39:12.403
You needed help

1:39:20.909 --> 1:39:23.084
Where’s your god now?

1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:24.769
Huh?

1:39:25.907 --> 1:39:29.064
Where’s your fucking god now?

1:39:37.772 --> 1:39:39.867
“You made me do this”

1:39:48.790 --> 1:39:50.537
[knocking on door]

1:39:57.438 --> 1:39:59.337
[knocking on door again]

1:40:11.038 --> 1:40:12.054
Here...

1:40:13.561 --> 1:40:16.022
Here’s the key to the house, okay. Let yourself in

1:40:21.367 --> 1:40:22.892
[key in lock]

1:40:27.327 --> 1:40:29.352
You’re going to rot in here

1:40:30.332 --> 1:40:32.445
So I suggest you start praying.

1:40:34.735 --> 1:40:36.473
[Tim laughs mockingly]

1:40:40.019 --> 1:40:41.472
Help! Now.

1:40:43.050 --> 1:40:44.147
You’re dead!

1:40:44.267 --> 1:40:44.871
Dead!

1:40:44.991 --> 1:40:47.153
-Calm down Abbie
- I killed you!
- Calm down

1:40:47.965 --> 1:40:50.844
[Abbie keeps screaming]

1:40:55.402 --> 1:40:57.996
You okay, sir? Let me see to that wound

1:40:58.116 --> 1:40:59.342
I’m okay. Thank you

1:40:59.779 --> 1:41:01.257
Just worried about my wife

1:41:01.377 --> 1:41:02.567
I know Mr Hemp

1:41:02.687 --> 1:41:04.422
Must be hard seeing her like that

1:41:04.912 --> 1:41:06.963
Life can be so cruel sometimes

1:41:08.621 --> 1:41:09.350
Yeah

1:41:10.812 --> 1:41:12.344
You’re dead!

1:41:52.587 --> 1:41:55.009
[mobile phone rings]

1:41:57.509 --> 1:41:58.505
Hey ma

1:41:58.603 --> 1:41:59.365
[Mother] Well?

1:41:59.463 --> 1:42:01.142
Yeah, just left the hospital

1:42:01.221 --> 1:42:01.983
[Mother] And Abbie?

1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:04.130
Yeah, don't worry about it

1:42:04.190 --> 1:42:05.147
She's sorted

1:42:05.282 --> 1:42:07.196
[Mother] Very good, son
[Tim chuckles]

1:42:07.295 --> 1:42:10.282
Yeah, look, I'm gonna be...
[Mother] You're well rid of her

1:42:10.439 --> 1:42:12.548
[Thud and sound of air brakes]

1:42:12.842 --> 1:42:14.954
[Mother] Tim? Tim?
