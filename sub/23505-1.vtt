My dad is the one with the coin.
I'm pretty much broke.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.773
Maybe we can work something out.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.938
My friend Lyle and I have a band.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.237
He plays the drums, I play bass, but...

25:21.311 --> 25:23.655
You need a guitarist?
- Yeah.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.278
The town's annual Firefly Festival's
at the end of the month.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.370
We really wanna play there.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.243
If you help us out

25:32.698 --> 25:35.622
I'll lend you that guitar for free
for the whole summer.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.831
You interested?
- Uh, yeah, totally!

25:49.089 --> 25:49.965
Hey!

25:50.674 --> 25:51.766
This is our road

25:51.842 --> 25:53.970
and we didn't give you permission
to use it!

25:54.803 --> 25:58.808
Um, actually, this is a public road
built with government funds

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
and it belongs to everyone.

26:00.142 --> 26:03.021
So technically you are correct.
It is yours, but it's also mine.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.863
Hey, you don't get off that easy!

26:05.189 --> 26:07.487
Look, I don't know what I did
to offend you guys

26:07.566 --> 26:08.863
but whatever it is, I'll stop.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.321
Course you will.
You'll be too busy crying!

26:11.820 --> 26:15.074
Seriously, doesn't your school
have an anti-bullying policy?

26:15.157 --> 26:17.205
Sure does.
That's exactly why we got kicked out.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.459
Right, John? High five!

26:19.870 --> 26:22.089
Ooh! Look, a guitar.
- Hey, give that back!

26:23.707 --> 26:24.754
BULLY SHOUTS OUT

26:25.084 --> 26:28.133
What was that?
- Whatever it was, it clawed me!

26:28.212 --> 26:30.465
WOODY: Ba, bu-da-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba!
- Woody!

26:30.547 --> 26:33.141
Now as for you two, where were we?

26:34.051 --> 26:35.268
THEY CRY OUT

26:39.181 --> 26:41.024
Get ready to go commando!

26:41.433 --> 26:42.901

Oh, this bird's psycho!

26:42.976 --> 26:44.273

26:46.146 --> 26:47.944
TOMMY:
Woody, that was awesome!

26:48.565 --> 26:50.067
You went all MMA on 'em!

26:50.150 --> 26:52.403
Nobody messes with my BFF-

26:52.778 --> 26:55.076
and by that I mean Bringer of Free Food.
See ya!

26:55.447 --> 26:57.575
Oh, come on, George,
you gotta be kidding rne.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.959
GEORGE: No.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.039
<i>GEORGE: Your bird did</i> a <i>number on us.
- It is not</i> my <i>bird.</i>

27:03.831 --> 27:08.052
Fine, fine. Just every day out here
is costing me money.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.044
INDISTINCT REPLY

27:09.128 --> 27:11.051
Yeah... Great, thank you.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.224
Hey, buddy, where you been?
- Town.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.057
LANCE: Where'd that come from?
- I'm starting a band with a girl I met.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.313
LANCE: Oh.
- Oh, fun fact:

27:20.389 --> 27:22.016
I almost got my butt kicked
on the way home.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.026
What are you talking about? By who?

27:24.685 --> 27:26.779
A couple of Neanderthal kids.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.110
<i>We. OK because Woody saved me.</i>

27:30.107 --> 27:31.575
Who's Woody?
- The woodpecker.

27:31.942 --> 27:35.697
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
Do not mention that stupid bird!

27:36.363 --> 27:37.455
Stupid?
- VAN ESSA: Yeah.

27:37.781 --> 27:41.661
Last I remember, that stupid bird
wasn't the one covered in bird poop.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.248
You know what? That's enough outta you.
You're on a time out. Go to you room.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.124
I don't have a room.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.092
Then go into the RV.

27:49.418 --> 27:50.294
Fine.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.463
Oh, and in case you were wondering

27:53.881 --> 27:56.930
nobody in town is happy
about us building a house up here.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.898
Can you believe that?
- I know, what is wrong with these people?

28:02.973 --> 28:05.943
Don't they understand how great this is
gonna be for their property values?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.235
No, Lance

28:08.020 --> 28:10.990
I'm talking about how disrespectful
your son is to me.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.776
Oh... Yeah, that.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.990
This isn't what I signed up for, OK?

28:16.778 --> 28:19.998
Being a stepmom to a bratty kid
who hates me.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.292
Baby, he doesn't hate you.
- He hates me.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.411
If anything, he's just mad at rne.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.085
He's just acting out.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.463
I know this is difficult,
but you've just gotta be patient.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.005
You'll see. We're gonna get
our old life back in no time.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.589
I promise.

28:36.506 --> 28:37.382
Hm.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.648
WOODY:
Wakey, wakey.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.392
Here's Woody!

28:47.643 --> 28:48.860
Ow! Ow! Ow!

28:49.561 --> 28:50.437
HE LAUGHS

28:53.398 --> 28:54.445
That is it!

28:55.651 --> 28:57.119
I am finished with you!

28:58.320 --> 28:59.993
Now, maybe you didn't get the memo!

29:00.906 --> 29:05.707
But, man, not wildlife,
is top of the food chain!

29:06.453 --> 29:12.176
So if I were you, I would get outta here
before you land on my rotisserie!

29:12.417 --> 29:14.670
If it's the last thing I...
- Nice rant. Easy to dance to.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.050
I'd give it a seven.
- Hey!

29:17.047 --> 29:18.094
WOODY LAUGHS

29:18.548 --> 29:21.097
Yeah, you better fly outta here!
- WOODY: Yeah right!

29:22.761 --> 29:25.184
Really? A pinecone?

29:25.722 --> 29:26.598
How pathet...

29:28.934 --> 29:31.813
WOODY LAUGHS

29:38.193 --> 29:40.241
You sure this foundation's deep enough,
George?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.288
I want this place to last longer
than these trees.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.536
Twice as long, sir.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.077
Trust me, been doin' this a long time,
alright?

29:46.326 --> 29:48.328
Babe, isn't this great?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.628
I'm not really a cement person.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.501
Can I have the keys for the car?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.462
I need to go to town and find a place
to get my highlights touched up.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.134
Hey, sweetheart?
- VANESSA: Mm.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.057
LANCE: What's that matter?
We're out here in the middle of nature.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.428
Yeah, and I wanna look natural.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.226
Keys are in the RV.
- OK.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.061
DRAMATIC MUSIC

30:12.811 --> 30:14.859
Time to get these trespassers outta here.

30:15.272 --> 30:18.196
We can do this the easy way
or the Woody way.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.202
I'm thinkin' the Woody way.

30:20.402 --> 30:21.449
HE LAUGHS WILDLY

30:22.738 --> 30:25.992
Come on, Tommy, you cannot sit in here
all day staring at a screen.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.706
There's nothing to do here.
- LANCE: Nothing to do here?

30:30.120 --> 30:32.339
They're getting ready to pour the cement.
That's cool.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.132
Let's go outside and watch them do that.

30:35.375 --> 30:39.300
Pass.
- Go outside and find something to do.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.090
Anything.
- Give that back!

30:41.173 --> 30:43.346
VANESSA:

30:43.425 --> 30:44.301

30:45.886 --> 30:46.762

30:46.845 --> 30:48.563
No, no, no, no, no, no!

30:49.097 --> 30:50.724
Jackie Chan taught me this one.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.980
Wa-ka! Woo!

30:53.268 --> 30:55.191
How about some of this?
How about some of that?

30:55.645 --> 30:56.737

31:26.468 --> 31:27.344
Oh!

32:16.518 --> 32:18.361
Nope. Nope.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.318
Nope. Yep, that's it.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.775
That's the flying demon right there.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.198
The Pileated Red-Crowned Woodpecker?
- Yep.

32:25.527 --> 32:26.449
Impossible.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.281
The Red-Crowned Woodpecker
has been extinct for almost a hundred years

32:29.698 --> 32:33.293
I'm telling you, that's the bird.
- Uh-huh. Sure it is.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.671
Any chance you're taking
any sort of medication?

32:36.746 --> 32:39.545
Look, I don't care
what kind of bird it is.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.844
I want it off my property for good.
Now how does that happen?

32:43.336 --> 32:45.509
Well, the local Native Americans

32:45.589 --> 32:48.012
believed it was
the incarnation of Marconda

32:48.258 --> 32:49.805
god of chaos and mayhem

32:50.135 --> 32:52.604
a mischievous trickster
who haunted the forest.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.933
Super factoid. What did they do about it?
- Moved away.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.193
Moved away?
- SAM: More like fled.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.025
Didn't even pack,
left all their things behind.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.568
Well, I'm not gonna flee.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.571
Can we just kill it?
- No, you can't just kill it.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.154
The woodpecker is a protected species.
You'd be breaking the law

33:09.404 --> 33:10.781
a 10,000 dollar fine.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.875
Do you take credit cards?

33:14.743 --> 33:16.211
And two years in jail.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.173
Alright, well there's Plan A.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.260

There is plenty of room for both of you.

a red-headed woodpecker with hands?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.397
Well, I feel like I know the answer
to this one.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.071
Hey, give me a hint?

33:47.150 --> 33:48.026

34:46.126 --> 34:48.800
Whoa-oa! What kind of bird is that?

34:48.878 --> 34:51.677
Some kind of woodpecker.
He lives up by my place.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.507
And before I met you guys

34:53.592 --> 34:55.719

my only friend out here.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.934

How can we help you, Mr Walters?

Well, I need you to trap it
and release it far, far away from here.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.514
I'd say kill it,
but apparently that's illegal.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.224

We would never, uh, break the <i>law.</i>

40:29.302 --> 40:30.349

40:31.679 --> 40:35.855

Probably a small animal:
mouse or a rat or a bird or something.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.558
That's possible.

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:47.815
HE WHIMPERS
- You!

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.030
Dad, Woody wouldn't have done this.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.652
It couldn't have been him.
- Really?

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.034
Do you see any other psychotic animals
around here?

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.574
It was that Woodpecker!
- Dad!

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.200
All this time, he's just been...
- Come on!

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.370
...lulling me into a fall sense of security,
waiting to strike.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.456
He couldn't have...

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.334
It's Lance Walters. Remember me?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.376
Of course we remember you, Mr Walters.

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:11.835
How can we help you?

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:14.171
Uh-huh.

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:17.682
Look, I'm... I'm...
I'm sure we can work you into our schedule.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.472

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:23.351
Well, how about... How about right now?

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.439
I didn't mean to.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:26.857
Accidents happen.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.770
Mean, who amongst us
hasn't burned down a house, right?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.650
Oh, fine. I'll just go back
to the way it was before: No humans.

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.238
Who needs them anyway, right?

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:37.861
Right?

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:41.453
Uh... Don't you ever have anything to say?

01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:44.163
Oh, who am I kidding?

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:46.290
I had a good thing goin' with those guys.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:48.709
I gotta make it up to them

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.842
help them rebuild, for free this time, too.
No food.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.087
I could stand to lose an ounce or two.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.388
CRASH, WOODY SCREAMS

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.267

What are you doing? You can't take Woody.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.148
Tommy, that bird burnt our house down.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:49.770
<i>But... But I...
- So long, Woodpecker.</i>

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.398
To think I was actually
starting to like you.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.276
Dad, they're gonna kill him.
- They're not gonna kill him.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.733
They're gonna take him out in the mountains
and release him.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.072
Yep, he'll be free <i>as</i> a, urn...

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.446
Free as a, uh...
- A bird.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.077
A little on the nose, Nate.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.788
I was thinkin' more like a wild stallion.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.254
Dad, Jill and Lyle and me found their barn.

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.206
It's filled with stuffed birds.

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:14.795
Taxidermists.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.586
They're gonna kill Woody and stuff him,
I know it.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.933
You are gonna let him go, right?
- Oh, uh...

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:25.723
I am as, uh...

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.055

I'm sorry, Woody!

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.622
I will never forgive you.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.291
Tommy, come on.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.714
Someday you'll understand
why I had to do this.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:56.215
I understand.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.961
I understand
that whenever something bothers you

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.009
you get rid of it

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:03.928

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.264
Come on, that is not fair and you know it.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.729

when I'm all caged up!

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.492
Why don't you open this cage
and we'll step outside and do this right?

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:27.948

We have to call the police

01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.064
or the National Guard.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.687

No, why?

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.620
I thought the Woodpecker
burnt my house down on purpose

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.047
so I hired the Grimes brothers
to capture and get rid of it.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:24.670

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.926

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.926
I'll peck you new ones,
and I ain't talkin' about nostrils!

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:16.180
Squawk it up, bird.
It's the last noise you'll ever make.

And we're not stickin' around to get caught!

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:31.112
We just sold that little bird
for close to a million dollars stuffed.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:35.950
Otis and me are officially retiring
to Kerching City.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.991
Kerching City. That's in China.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.129
What?
- Start loading the truck.

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.042
Please.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:02.647
Excuse me, Mr Poacher, sir,
is that poison gluten free?

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.645
Aw, don't worry, bird.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.944

You got a moose problem now or...?

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:56.318
I was lookin' for Tommy. He was pretty upset
about the whole woodpecker thing

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:58.495
and I... I thought he might've come up here
lookin' for it.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:03.700
Well, you know how kids are about animals.
I'm sure he'll be fine in a couple of days.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.877

We're just, uh, clearin' out
while we fumigate the place.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.101
Yeah, you do not wanna breathe
those chemicals.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.522
I learned that the hard way.

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:31.148
Wait a minute.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.231
I want the woodpecker back.
- You do?

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:37.108
You do?
- Yeah, I do.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:40.411
If that's what it takes
to make my son happy, it's worth it.

We already let him go.

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.418
Come on, Lance, let's go find Tommy.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.919
Good luck findin' your, you know, kid.

Otis, let's stuff that bird

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:10.183
What are you doing?

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.190
For the past year I've been finding these
wherever there's been poaching.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:14.858
It has to be them.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.323
And I bet anything they still have Woody.

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:20.071
Get the gun, Otis.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.986
It's time to wrap this up!

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:23.742
Please don't.

Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.790
I just couldn't let them kill Woody.
- Tommy, this is not your fault.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.592
If I had listened to you in the first place,
we wouldn't be here.

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:21.674
Uh, real heartfelt moment

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.722
but can we please save the schmaltz
for later?

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:26.517

OTIS: Save... Save us from that bird.
- NATE: Lock us up. I'm beggin' you.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.801
I have been waiting for this day
for a very long time.

Well, I think you're going to be
very happy here.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.574

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.996
I'm surprised you didn't want
to build a shopping mall.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.539

Niagara affects different people
in different ways.

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:09.943
Some people are overcome by a strong urge
to go over the falls in a barrel.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.280
Of course, this foolhardy stunt
is now absolutely prohibited.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:19.582
And, I might add, nobody has gone over
since I've been on the job.

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:21.954
Nobody?
- Nobody.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:22.993

Hooray! Hooray!
