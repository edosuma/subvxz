00:13.125 --> 00:15.916
<i>Oh, my God. Baby. It's okay.</i>

00:18.791 --> 00:20.916
<i>You have to get away from her.</i>

00:21.708 --> 00:24.875
<i>You and our baby. Promise me.</i>

00:26.708 --> 00:29.416
<i>No. No!</i>

00:36.125 --> 00:38.208
<i>Dr. Navarro…</i>

00:42.291 --> 00:43.291
Who is here?

00:51.291 --> 00:52.458
My baby?

00:53.916 --> 00:55.666
I'll get the doctor for you.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.625
Tell me now.

01:00.458 --> 01:01.458
I'm sorry.

01:08.041 --> 01:11.791
We thought you were the girl that
went missing. So we called your family.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.833
They told us it was your sister.

01:14.916 --> 01:17.416
But the good news is
they're coming.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.333
So you just rest, love.
Till they get here.

01:41.291 --> 01:46.041
<i>Dr. Navarro call 312.</i>
<i>Dr. Navarro, 312.</i>

01:52.458 --> 01:55.500
Leni, they're after me, Towers and Payne.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.416
They got Dylan and now they want me.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.166
Are you sure it's them? Do you have proof?

02:01.250 --> 02:02.750
Yes, I have proof.

02:02.833 --> 02:04.750
<i>Jesus. Crap. Where you at?</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:06.750
I'm on the move, it's not safe for me.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.916
I need your help, sis.
Can you come and get me?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
Oh, my God.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.125
Georgia!

03:01.916 --> 03:04.666
That was found
under the front seat of your car.

03:04.750 --> 03:05.666
What?

03:29.333 --> 03:32.291
You say Gina framed you.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.250
Yes.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.458
Why would she do something like that?

03:37.541 --> 03:39.250
She's unstable.

03:39.958 --> 03:43.208
I mean, she has been for a long time.

03:43.291 --> 03:48.750
Yeah, I'm gonna need a stronger motive
than "she's prone to mood swings."

03:49.541 --> 03:51.000
Don't you think it's strange

03:51.083 --> 03:56.541
that this, uh… this photo arrived
in your inbox from an unknown source

03:56.625 --> 03:59.750
and an anonymous caller alerted you

03:59.833 --> 04:03.208
to the fact that I might have
incriminating evidence in my car?

04:03.291 --> 04:08.291
I mean, was the voice
who called you male or female?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.375
You know Mount Echo.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.000
People hold grudges for generations.

04:13.083 --> 04:16.458
They get bent out of shape if you raise
a fence line two inches.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.916
Most of the crimes I solve,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.625
they get done 'cause of a neighbor
or a business partner…

04:24.208 --> 04:25.333
…or a sister

04:27.291 --> 04:28.500
turns someone in.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.416
Yeah.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.458
So if it was Gina, she's been a big help.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.833
Yeah. Big help.

04:34.916 --> 04:40.500
And it would have also mean that
she probably has more information

04:40.583 --> 04:41.958
than she is sharing.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.000
Gina McCleary, you're under arrest.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.625
What? What did she tell you?

05:01.708 --> 05:03.625
She hasn't told me anything. Yet.

05:03.708 --> 05:05.416
She's trying to pin this on me, isn't she?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.875
No, this isn't about Dylan.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.166
This is about Robert Craghorne,

05:09.250 --> 05:12.958
who died in a fire
in an abandoned church 25 years ago.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.583
You remember that, yes?

05:15.375 --> 05:18.458
-You're under arrest for murder.
-What?

05:32.708 --> 05:38.041
Now, why do you think that
Leni would cook up a whopper like that?

05:38.125 --> 05:39.708
You two having trouble?

05:40.750 --> 05:41.625
Not really.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.166
Hmm. Even though she was having an affair
with your former boyfriend.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.875
That might get my dander up.

05:46.958 --> 05:50.333
Leni didn't share with me that
she was having an affair with Dylan.

05:51.041 --> 05:56.416
And I have a wonderful life in Los Angeles
with a husband I love very much.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.666
-You know, Leni's problems are her own.
-Mmm.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.541
Yeah, that's the way I see it.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.708
You lack motive,
because you couldn't care less

06:04.791 --> 06:06.958
about some sketchy criminal.

06:07.041 --> 06:08.708
-No offense, Dylan.
-Yeah.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.916
No. I mean, I care.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.666
I loved him when we were teenagers.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.875
But now I'm being charged
with the murder of someone,

06:15.958 --> 06:18.666
that I don't even know,
who died in a fire decades ago.

06:18.750 --> 06:22.458
I mean, I'd like to know why
you're bringing that up now and why me?

06:22.541 --> 06:26.333
You see, a lot of things
have gotten stirred up lately.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.958
It got me thinking.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.875
You all were questioned
the night of the fire.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.541
But then Dylan skipped town
and I had to let it drop.

06:37.625 --> 06:43.083
I didn't have enough to file charges
or even pursue him, but it was suspicious.

06:43.750 --> 06:47.416
And then, more recently,
your sister disappears.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.416
So now, as you can imagine,

06:49.500 --> 06:56.083
I'm very, very curious
as to how all these things tie together.

06:56.166 --> 07:00.125
And Dylan always seems to be
at the center of these things.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.500
Along with you and your sister.

07:04.666 --> 07:06.666
Maybe you want to help me out with that.

07:08.041 --> 07:11.125
Like I told you when I was a teenager,
I didn't set that fire.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.041
<i>I was at a Halloween party.</i>

07:55.208 --> 07:56.041
Who's that?

07:56.708 --> 07:58.375
-Want me to check?
-Please.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.291
Sure.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.166
Fire! Shit! There's a fire!

08:13.250 --> 08:15.791
-Shit. There's a fire! We gotta get out!

08:18.875 --> 08:21.458
-Hey! Hey, there's fire!

08:21.541 --> 08:22.916
Go! I'll get him.

08:23.541 --> 08:25.125
There's a fire! Fire!

08:26.875 --> 08:28.333
-Go!
-Dylan!

08:28.416 --> 08:29.958
Go! I'll get him!

08:40.916 --> 08:41.875
Dylan!

08:43.833 --> 08:45.875
-Dylan!
-Gina!

08:45.958 --> 08:47.916
Dylan's still in there
with someone else.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.041
He's going to be fine. Let's go!

09:04.875 --> 09:08.708
Gina! You have to switch with me.
You have to switch with me now.

09:08.791 --> 09:10.166
But why?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.000
So the cops can't put you with Dylan.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.416
I was at the party all this time.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.916
Whoever was in that church
is going to get in so much trouble.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.500
Okay?

09:19.041 --> 09:20.791
I'm gonna protect you, Gina.

09:32.416 --> 09:36.791
You can see why I might be
a little suspicious of your story,

09:36.875 --> 09:38.875
that Leni set the fire.

09:38.958 --> 09:42.375
'Cause the only person
who can corroborate that is dead.

09:42.458 --> 09:46.333
And I guess you have someone
who can back your theory?

09:47.375 --> 09:49.541
Let me guess. That person is Leni.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.708
Well, Leni said she never went
inside the church. So, no.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.708
And you believe her.

09:54.791 --> 09:56.916
I questioned you both that night

09:57.000 --> 10:01.083
and you both claimed
to be at the party the entire time.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.000
<i>And no kid could say, for sure, otherwise.</i>

10:06.208 --> 10:09.416
Yeah, that works nicely for Leni.
Don't you think?

10:09.500 --> 10:13.125
What I think is that the two of you
have been doing this for a long time.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.833
You cause trouble
and then you get out of it,

10:15.916 --> 10:18.375
using your twinship to confuse people.

10:18.458 --> 10:22.666
You deceive people on a regular basis
for your own purposes, isn't that right?

10:25.916 --> 10:26.750
Maybe.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.083
As kids.

10:29.666 --> 10:33.750
But we haven't done that
in a long time. Except…

10:35.208 --> 10:37.958
You might want to ask Leni how
she came into possession

10:38.041 --> 10:40.791
of a check for $60,000

10:40.875 --> 10:43.083
that came directly from my bank account.

10:56.541 --> 10:57.708
So…

10:58.916 --> 11:03.916
I gave Eric from the bank
a call about this.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.625
And let me tell you something,
he was cranky.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.166
I guess it is a little late.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.166
But even at this late hour,
his memory's pretty good.

11:12.250 --> 11:16.541
It seems like there was
some confusion around a missing ID,

11:16.625 --> 11:19.000
which then suddenly appeared,
and surprise, surprise,

11:19.083 --> 11:21.625
Dylan was involved.

11:22.208 --> 11:26.333
The part that confuses me is,
if Gina picked up the check,

11:26.416 --> 11:30.750
then how did you get it to hand to Towers?

11:31.333 --> 11:35.291
Uh, she gave me the check at the party.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.250
-Oh. Right.
-Yeah.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.583
As a gift, 'cause she knows
Jack and I are struggling with the farm.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.500
Mmm-hmm.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.208
So the tension that you'd witnessed,

11:43.291 --> 11:46.166
you know, that a lot of people
at the party had witnessed,

11:46.250 --> 11:47.458
was around this money.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.083
I mean, I think she's jealous.

11:51.250 --> 11:55.416
You know, resentful of this wonderful life
that Jack and I have.

11:55.500 --> 12:00.458
If your life is so wonderful,
why have an affair with Dylan?

12:00.541 --> 12:03.625
I didn't have an affair with Dylan.

12:03.708 --> 12:06.000
I was trying to help him
get back on his feet.

12:06.083 --> 12:10.083
And that involved
stealing ketamine from Jack's office

12:10.166 --> 12:11.416
to sell on the street?

12:12.791 --> 12:13.916
I never did that.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.041
That's funny.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.416
Wait here for just a minute, okay?

12:37.125 --> 12:38.625
-What's going on?
-Dad.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.125
Why'd she bring you in here?

12:40.208 --> 12:43.125
She's playing me. Playing both of us.

12:43.208 --> 12:45.958
You didn't say anything?
You didn't say anything about--

12:46.041 --> 12:47.541
Leni, baby.

12:48.333 --> 12:52.000
Floss thinks that Gina set that fire
back in the day that killed that man.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.291
And you're in here
because of Dylan's murder?

12:55.875 --> 12:59.583
That's not my family.
That's not the girls I raised.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.083
Daddy, I'm gonna fix it.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.000
Okay?

13:11.333 --> 13:12.875
I'll love you no matter what.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.208
-No matter what.
-I know.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:36.666 --> 13:37.541
All right.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.208
Uh, you let Victor in there?

13:41.291 --> 13:43.625
Hell yeah, I put him in there.
He runs that place.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.125
He knows about the ketamine.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.541
She's keeping him very quiet though.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.708
Uh, well,
the test came back from the cabin.

13:50.791 --> 13:54.208
Not only have we got both sisters' prints,
but we have both of their DNA.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.166
Of course. Why would it be simple?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.166
Here's the thing, though. Uh…

13:58.250 --> 14:01.375
They ran DNA
on the dishes in the cabinets,

14:01.458 --> 14:04.500
the towels in the hamper…
Everything that'd been around for a while.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.833
And it's all Dylan and Gina.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.541
No, you mean Leni.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.375
I mean Gina.

14:23.291 --> 14:28.416
Paula, you ever finish
sifting through that CCTV footage?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.875
Uh, no.
We've been a little distracted.

14:30.958 --> 14:33.291
-Yeah, I'mma need you to do that now.
-Why?

14:33.875 --> 14:35.041
I got an idea.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.916
-Were you sharing him?
-What? Who?

14:45.625 --> 14:48.208
Dylan. Were you sharing him?

14:48.291 --> 14:49.500
Jesus.

14:49.583 --> 14:52.125
First thing that gets said
about the McCleary sisters

14:52.208 --> 14:53.416
is that they share everything.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.833
You don't know us.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.250
You have no idea what we're like.
Nobody does.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.041
Then help me understand why I have

15:01.125 --> 15:02.833
both sets of fingerprints in the cabin.

15:02.916 --> 15:04.750
That's a great question for Gina.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.791
Who says she didn't know
you were fucking him?

15:06.875 --> 15:08.875
Pardon my French, but you know what?

15:08.958 --> 15:12.125
I think she did and it was the last straw.

15:12.208 --> 15:15.625
It was the one thing that
she just could not share with you.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.833
Or maybe you couldn't share with her.
Which one was it, Leni?

15:19.916 --> 15:20.750
You're reaching.

15:20.833 --> 15:24.750
Jealous sisters with a proven history
of violent outbursts.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.875
Yeah, like what?

15:25.958 --> 15:29.708
Like Claudia.
Like the church fire. And now this.

15:29.791 --> 15:31.041
Oh, my God.

15:31.125 --> 15:34.583
Fighting over an old flame
and somehow he ends up dead

15:34.666 --> 15:37.541
after a botched robbery attempt
that you were involved in.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.791
Yeah, I think I'm ready for my lawyer now.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.125
I bet you are.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.583
Sheriff, I need you for a minute.

16:04.875 --> 16:05.875
Good work.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.208
<i>You know what, Gina?</i>

16:08.291 --> 16:11.875
I am a people person. I really am.

16:11.958 --> 16:16.125
And you want to know why?
It's because they're made up of patterns.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.125
Things that they do over and over again,
that reveal who they really are.

16:22.208 --> 16:27.000
So when things don't add up,
when they're not part of the pattern,

16:27.083 --> 16:29.125
then I pay attention.

16:30.083 --> 16:34.875
So here's a pattern that I laid out
for Leni, which she did not like hearing.

16:34.958 --> 16:40.416
But I thought that maybe
you might have a different take on. Um…

16:43.750 --> 16:46.583
The two of you have
been confusing outsiders

16:46.666 --> 16:48.791
for as long as you've been alive.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.208
Whenever there's trouble,
you just muddy the waters

16:51.291 --> 16:53.041
about who is who.

16:53.583 --> 16:57.291
But when it comes to matters of the heart,

16:57.375 --> 16:59.333
the emotional side of things,

17:00.416 --> 17:02.458
it always seems to point to you.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.666
Victor told me that's how
your mother could tell you apart.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.291
Gina is the one who
feels things a little more.

17:34.750 --> 17:38.916
The hospital admits
a Jane Doe suffering a miscarriage.

17:40.875 --> 17:44.541
They thought it was Leni,
but it wasn't, it was you.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.375
And that baby was Dylan's.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.708
Am I right about that? I think I am.

17:50.333 --> 17:55.125
He was your one great love
and that baby was a gift.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.875
It's romantic. It's your pattern.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.416
But here's where the pattern doesn't hold.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.250
The part that I now have
to pay attention to.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.708
The timeline doesn't work.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.541
'Cause you only came to town
a few days ago.

18:14.666 --> 18:20.250
So, I am going to need you
to tell me the truth, Gina.

18:20.791 --> 18:25.291
What would Dylan want you to do
at this moment to honor him?

18:40.708 --> 18:41.958
He wanted me to go.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.166
And never look back.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.708
So, yeah, there's a pattern.

18:52.708 --> 18:53.625
And here it is.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.291
Every year since Mattie was born,

18:58.375 --> 19:03.083
Leni and I switched lives on our birthday.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.375
You're screwing with me again.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.333
I've been working on this for 25 years.

19:16.916 --> 19:19.875
Putting it together piece by piece.

19:19.958 --> 19:23.458
You honestly think that I am that stupid?

19:24.166 --> 19:26.750
I'm just some Black country bumpkin,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.750
don't know her ass
from a hole in the ground.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.541
Come on, Gina! Cut the shit!

20:02.125 --> 20:04.583
Well, I'll tell you what, Sheriff,

20:04.666 --> 20:07.916
you can't believe a thing that Gina says.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.500
I mean,
she's a troubled soul, right?

20:14.250 --> 20:15.541
We all know that.

20:16.750 --> 20:22.166
I mean, she will manipulate you and
make you believe things that are not true.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.541
And get you chasing your tail.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.375
I mean, she has done it before.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.708
She will do it again.

20:39.416 --> 20:40.833
See?

20:40.916 --> 20:42.833
Oh, God.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.583
It's not that hard.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.250
We live inside each other's lives.

20:50.333 --> 20:54.333
We fool everyone flawlessly.

20:55.708 --> 20:58.375
So you can't be really sure
who that is on that video.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.875
You can't be really sure who
escaped into the woods with the horses,

21:02.958 --> 21:04.791
or who set a fire, or pushed Claudia

21:04.875 --> 21:06.958
or killed Dylan.

21:09.416 --> 21:12.875
Because nobody knows us.

21:15.916 --> 21:16.958
Except us.

21:20.666 --> 21:22.541
If what you say is true,

21:24.291 --> 21:29.875
then you've been committing
identity theft, bank fraud, polygamy…

21:29.958 --> 21:32.375
And I am just getting started.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.875
When you say "you,"

21:37.375 --> 21:39.166
who exactly do you mean?

21:40.208 --> 21:42.750
'Cause I'm not sure I even know anymore.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.541
You're free to go.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.708
I can't charge either of you

21:59.791 --> 22:03.666
if I don't know
which one of you actually did it.

22:04.416 --> 22:07.583
In both cases. Dylan and the fire.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.458
Yeah, Gina told me about the switching.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.500
How you assume
each other's lives on your birthday.

22:16.958 --> 22:19.583
Makes my life here considerably harder.

22:19.666 --> 22:23.583
And yours too, I imagine,
now that everyone knows.

22:27.666 --> 22:28.541
Can I go?

22:29.833 --> 22:31.000
For now.

22:32.166 --> 22:34.416
You'll be required
to turn over your passports

22:34.500 --> 22:37.250
and remain in town until further notice.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.916
Somewhere along the way

22:42.375 --> 22:44.458
one of you made a mistake.

22:45.041 --> 22:46.541
I'm going to find it.

22:46.625 --> 22:52.375
I don't care how long it takes,
what I have to do, I'mma get you.

22:59.541 --> 23:01.750
Best of luck finding a lawyer.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.375
Sheriff Floss, how much longer?

23:22.458 --> 23:24.375
We're done. I'm releasing them both.

23:24.458 --> 23:25.666
Wait, what happened?

23:25.750 --> 23:28.083
Why don't you ask them, Victor?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.375
It must be a burden lifted.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.708
Finally telling the truth.

23:43.666 --> 23:44.750
It is.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.125
I read your notes.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.375
I gathered.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.625
Why did you go along with it
all these years?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.916
Well, it took a bit of time
for me to be sure

23:58.000 --> 24:03.416
and then I… I just sensed
that it was what you needed.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.375
And if that meant sharing you…

24:05.458 --> 24:09.416
Well, I set aside my… my hurt feelings,

24:09.500 --> 24:11.708
so I could better understand
how to love you.

24:12.875 --> 24:14.083
How to love both of you.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.041
You loved her, too?

24:20.208 --> 24:21.375
Does that upset you?

24:21.958 --> 24:22.791
No.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.208
-Always the therapist.
-No.

24:28.625 --> 24:31.166
Always someone who cares for you.

24:31.791 --> 24:34.833
And always someone who
truly wants to see you find your way

24:34.916 --> 24:38.500
to becoming your own,
fully realized person.

24:38.583 --> 24:42.125
And I believe you're closer now
than you've ever been before, aren't you?

24:43.125 --> 24:46.416
Or you were, with, um… with Dylan.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.833
I truly never meant to hurt you.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.166
I know.

24:55.875 --> 24:58.125
But I'd be lying
if I told you it didn't hurt.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.500
What's done is done.

25:16.416 --> 25:17.250
Yeah.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.208
What the hell are you doing here?

25:39.458 --> 25:41.958
You can't really think it's okay.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.125
Jack, if you just let me--

25:43.208 --> 25:45.250
Floss is getting a search warrant.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.583
She seems very interested
in the dress you were wearing

25:47.666 --> 25:49.208
the night of Dylan's murder.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.875
You don't actually think
I could have done that?

25:52.958 --> 25:55.875
Not the Leni I knew before. But now?

25:58.041 --> 25:59.291
How long, Leni?

26:00.708 --> 26:03.041
-How many times did you switch?
-Does it matter now?

26:03.833 --> 26:06.916
I mean, I did it for Gina.
I didn't expect it to go on for that long.

26:07.000 --> 26:07.833
For Gina?

26:09.375 --> 26:10.833
Who gives a shit about Gina?

26:12.125 --> 26:13.166
What about me?

26:14.208 --> 26:15.458
What about your daughter?

26:15.541 --> 26:18.916
How could you leave her for a year
at a time with your sister of all people?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.083
No, she loves Mattie.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.083
You have betrayed everything, Leni,

26:22.166 --> 26:23.791
and you destroyed our lives here

26:23.875 --> 26:26.041
without a single thought
about the consequences.

26:26.750 --> 26:30.208
My family's whole history
is tied to Mount Echo.

26:30.291 --> 26:34.583
How will I ever walk through the town
where I grew up without folks whispering,

26:34.666 --> 26:37.666
"There goes poor Jack.
You really think he didn't know?"

26:37.750 --> 26:39.333
"I bet he did and he liked it."

26:40.541 --> 26:42.083
You ruined my reputation,

26:42.166 --> 26:45.166
my family's business,
our daughter's future. Forever!

26:45.750 --> 26:46.666
And for what?

26:47.416 --> 26:48.291
Daddy.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.875
-What's wrong?
-Mattie. Baby.

26:53.958 --> 26:55.041
No. Don't.

26:55.958 --> 26:57.958
-Don't you dare.
-Mommy?

26:58.041 --> 27:00.291
Go back to bed, all right?
Mom and Dad are talking.

27:01.000 --> 27:01.958
Fighting.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.291
No, baby.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.375
Go on back up to bed.
I'm going to see you in the morning.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.041
Go on now.

27:09.666 --> 27:10.541
Go on.

27:19.541 --> 27:21.541
That's the last memory she'll have of you.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.458
-Jack.
-I want it clear in your mind.

27:25.041 --> 27:27.375
Clear. That you are not welcome here.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.000
And you never will be again.

27:31.166 --> 27:33.458
You cannot keep me away from her.

27:34.416 --> 27:35.375
Watch me.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.750
I need you to leave.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.666
You've gotta be kidding me. What is this?

28:21.250 --> 28:22.250
It's grocery day.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.208
Thought I'd save you the trouble.

28:25.291 --> 28:27.916
Don't try to make things normal,
get on my good side.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.166
It's too late for that.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.541
Look, whatever you think of me,
Clauds, what I've done…

28:33.791 --> 28:36.500
You need to know, I didn't kill Dylan.
I loved him.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.208
We were going to start a life together.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.791
Leaving behind me, Dad and everybody else?

28:41.875 --> 28:44.583
I'm glad you felt so moved
to clear that up for me.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.041
Look.

28:52.625 --> 28:55.250
I admit I made mistakes, all right?

28:55.333 --> 28:57.250
I've made a big mess of this,

28:57.333 --> 28:59.708
but Claudia,
I am asking you to listen to me.

28:59.791 --> 29:05.000
This whole year has been
my goodbye to you.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.500
All right? I wanted to know that
you could have a life of your own,

29:09.583 --> 29:13.916
apart from us, apart from Dad,
and everything that has happened.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.250
So, in my own way,

29:15.958 --> 29:19.875
I tried to be a little bit softer, kinder.

29:21.958 --> 29:27.041
It was you who encouraged me
to pursue Beau, wasn't it? And not Leni?

29:28.083 --> 29:28.916
Yeah.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.291
Why should I believe you now?

29:31.375 --> 29:33.125
You've been lying for years.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.500
You've been trouble
since we were little kids.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.791
You did this to me. You did!

29:47.833 --> 29:49.125
That's not true.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.166
It wasn't me.

29:54.583 --> 29:55.500
It was Leni.

29:58.166 --> 30:00.375
This one's mine!

30:00.458 --> 30:05.041
No, mine has a different button
Mama sewed on it. Yours doesn't!

30:05.125 --> 30:06.625
Stop it, you two!

30:06.708 --> 30:09.791
This is why I wanted to write
your names on them. Stop, this one is…

30:16.666 --> 30:19.166
She's gonna think it was you, Gina.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.791
<i>But it was you, Leni.</i>

30:22.375 --> 30:24.166
<i>No one's gonna believe that.</i>

30:24.875 --> 30:27.708
I'll have to keep being you for a while.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.916
We didn't want people
to know we switched.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.125
I thought Leni was doing it to protect me.

30:37.666 --> 30:40.041
What I didn't understand at the time

30:40.125 --> 30:42.583
was that for the rest of our life that lie

30:44.125 --> 30:47.041
would put a wall between you and I.

30:47.541 --> 30:51.208
So fucking what?
Who cares which one of you pushed me?

30:52.125 --> 30:53.916
You deserve the truth.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.291
You've been sitting
on that secret for our entire lives

30:56.375 --> 30:58.791
and now, only now,
when you're about to go to prison,

30:58.875 --> 31:00.333
you decide to tell the truth.

31:00.416 --> 31:02.666
Fuck you, Gina! Fuck you!

31:11.875 --> 31:12.750
You're right.

31:15.666 --> 31:18.666
And you can't really blame
that one on Leni, now, can you?

31:54.041 --> 31:55.125
Hey.

31:59.000 --> 31:59.833
Look…

32:00.666 --> 32:01.708
Thanks for coming.

32:02.583 --> 32:03.958
So which one are you, then?

32:04.500 --> 32:07.208
Look, I know. The hair,
the clothes, the name.

32:07.291 --> 32:09.666
None of that matters. All right?

32:09.750 --> 32:12.166
It was the person inside and that was me.

32:12.916 --> 32:16.958
Paula, I didn't set that fire
and I didn't kill Dylan

32:17.041 --> 32:18.875
and I need you to believe me.

32:19.500 --> 32:23.500
Well, I want to believe you. I do, but…

32:24.125 --> 32:27.041
I could tell you everything.

32:28.250 --> 32:31.750
You know, admit to all the terrible lies
that I've told over the years.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.041
The little deceptions
that have led to bigger ones.

32:34.125 --> 32:36.125
I could tell everybody.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.541
But that wouldn't help, right?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.750
It'd just give people
more reason to stare.

32:44.291 --> 32:45.666
And I won't give them that.

32:47.875 --> 32:48.833
I can't.

32:51.791 --> 32:52.750
So…

32:55.500 --> 32:56.958
the secret stays secret.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.416
I didn't kill anyone.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.875
Well, for what it's worth,

33:02.333 --> 33:03.791
I don't think you did.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.333
But I don't know how I can help you.

33:10.041 --> 33:11.583
I don't think anybody can.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.791
I hope you don't disappear

33:22.583 --> 33:24.333
because that never solves anything.

33:42.083 --> 33:42.958
Dad.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.333
Yeah. I'll be right there.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.750
Dad?

34:06.125 --> 34:08.041
Oh, my God. Dad!

34:09.166 --> 34:11.000
Dad, what happened? Are you okay?

34:11.083 --> 34:11.916
Gina…

34:12.000 --> 34:14.833
-Oh, my God. Dad, talk to me.
-I can't.

34:14.916 --> 34:16.625
-I can't.
-Talk to me, please.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.666
-Here. I got you.
-Is that you?

34:18.750 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, I got you. Sit up.
All right. Hey. I got you. Okay?

34:24.125 --> 34:25.916
I'm gonna grab my phone to call 911.

34:26.000 --> 34:26.958
No, wait. Wait.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.500
I need to say this. I need you to hear me.

34:30.583 --> 34:32.500
Okay. What is it?

34:33.083 --> 34:37.083
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-What?

34:37.166 --> 34:39.500
It's all right, Dad.
It's gonna be all right.

34:39.583 --> 34:40.875
I know it was you.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.250
All those years ago.

34:45.791 --> 34:47.791
-What?
-I should've got you help.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.625
I should've sent you to someone.

34:50.708 --> 34:53.083
What? What are you trying to say?

34:53.166 --> 34:55.958
No child should have to see that.

34:57.583 --> 35:00.750
You weren't supposed to be there.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.916
-I didn't know what to do.
-Dad.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.375
-And it ruined your life.
-What did? It…

35:05.458 --> 35:07.583
Dad, nothing ruined my life.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.250
To see your mother that way.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.208
It's what she wanted, you understand?

35:15.291 --> 35:18.083
She was in so much pain. That's why…

35:19.791 --> 35:21.125
What was? Dad?

35:28.541 --> 35:29.875
Apple blossoms.

35:32.333 --> 35:36.666
You remember there were
apple blossoms everywhere, right?

35:36.750 --> 35:37.750
Dad.

35:37.833 --> 35:40.875
That spring, all of us…

35:43.000 --> 35:44.041
together.

35:46.916 --> 35:48.208
-Dad.
-Blossoms falling.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.083
Dad, I don't understand.

35:55.125 --> 35:56.000
Dad?

36:04.125 --> 36:05.375
Please, Dad.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.541
Daddy.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.750
Daddy.

37:03.916 --> 37:04.791
Gina.

37:09.708 --> 37:10.583
What?

37:21.583 --> 37:26.666
You're supposed to wait for me
to finish and then you start.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.708
-What're my silly girls up to?

37:31.791 --> 37:35.291
Gina, hop on off your sister's lap
and y'all come on inside for dinner.

37:35.375 --> 37:38.000
Victor! Claudia! It's time to eat, y'all!

37:38.666 --> 37:40.791
Dessert first
and it has to be carrot cake.

37:40.875 --> 37:44.166
Oh, yeah? Dessert first?
I don't think so, missy.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.833
<i>-What do you think, honey?</i>
<i>-It's my number one rule.</i>

38:08.583 --> 38:09.500
He's dead.

38:14.791 --> 38:15.833
He's gone, Leni.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.291
What?

38:23.291 --> 38:24.291
Dad.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.958
Did you call 911?

38:26.541 --> 38:28.000
-No.
-What?

38:28.583 --> 38:29.958
There may still be time.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.125
No, it's… it's done.

38:34.333 --> 38:35.791
No. I…

38:40.750 --> 38:42.333
I didn't get to say goodbye.

38:43.041 --> 38:44.250
There was no goodbye.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.250
He was talking about something that
he thought I understood, but I didn't.

38:51.541 --> 38:52.416
Okay…

38:52.958 --> 38:53.791
Um…

38:55.375 --> 38:59.083
We need to call the ambulance,
get our story straight.

38:59.666 --> 39:00.708
But…

39:00.791 --> 39:01.833
What story?

39:01.916 --> 39:04.666
There's too many eyes on us
to explain another body.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.458
Let's make a plan to save ourselves.

39:06.541 --> 39:07.583
-No!
-You and me.

39:07.666 --> 39:10.583
-Enough!
-We have done it before, Gina.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.375
-We can do it again.
-Leni, stop!

39:15.000 --> 39:19.458
Right. I don't want
to be a part of anything you do!

39:21.041 --> 39:22.375
You killed Dylan.

39:25.291 --> 39:26.458
You wouldn't.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.041
-Try me!

39:31.625 --> 39:32.958
Why did you kill him?

39:33.541 --> 39:34.583
I would never.

39:34.666 --> 39:38.250
Stop! I was with him. He told me.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.875
What did he ever do to you?

39:41.958 --> 39:44.625
He attacked me. Okay?

39:45.500 --> 39:49.166
It was self-defense. He was violent, Gina.

39:49.250 --> 39:51.250
I loved him.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.708
He was so good to me.

39:58.958 --> 40:03.791
And you couldn't stand that
I had happiness apart from you, so you--

40:29.666 --> 40:30.875
Oh, fuck!

40:36.250 --> 40:37.583
-No.
-Oh, shit.

40:39.583 --> 40:42.291
This place is going up.
Help me get Dad and get out of here.

40:42.375 --> 40:45.625
No, this is it.
We stick together just like always.

40:47.083 --> 40:48.416
I'm not letting you go.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.333
Leni!

40:49.416 --> 40:51.416
Why can't people understand?

40:51.500 --> 40:55.333
Why won't you understand
that I love you more than anything?
