WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:03.971
[Crow caws]

00:04.671 --> 00:06.004
Where are we going again?

00:06.005 --> 00:07.172
Nowhere.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.174
That doesn't make sense.
You can't go nowhere.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.310
You got to go somewhere.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.812
I told you, Axl. We're
out for a Sunday drive.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.181
I'm sorry. I'm not getting this.
Are you guys getting this?

00:16.181 --> 00:18.517
It's a drive. There's nothing to get.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.685
Well, are we gonna stop for lunch?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.720
No, then we'd be going to lunch.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.323
And this is not going to lunch.
It's a drive.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.891
But what is the point?

00:25.892 --> 00:27.759
The point is to go for a drive.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.295
You breathe the air, you
look at the scenery.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.797
We used to do it all the
time when we were kids.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.465
Oh, my God. Is this a mom idea?

00:33.466 --> 00:35.133
Definitely smells like a mom idea.

00:35.134 --> 00:37.703
She's always looking to
make memories on the cheap.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.805
Actually, it was your dad's idea,

00:39.806 --> 00:42.774
so feel free to direct
any complaints to him.

00:42.775 --> 00:44.776
Hey, how about we kick
things up with a car game.

00:44.777 --> 00:45.944
20 questions.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.379
Oh, I'll start. Why are we doing this?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.448
Why are we doing this? Why are
we doing this? Why are we...

00:49.449 --> 00:50.949
So, we're really not going anywhere?

00:50.950 --> 00:53.819
- We seriously have no destination?
- [Sighs]

00:53.820 --> 00:55.153
Nope. This is it.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.356
We're driving. The drive is what's fun.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.524
But this isn't fun.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.959
Axl: See, this is what happens
when people get to a certain age.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.394
They just scroll through their past

01:02.395 --> 01:04.396
looking for something to prove
their whole life wasn't a waste.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.831
It's a death drive.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.299
Oh, and because their
bodies have betrayed them,

01:07.300 --> 01:08.667
they need something easy

01:08.668 --> 01:09.801
so they don't have to
walk up stairs and stuff.

01:09.802 --> 01:11.136
We're not 100!

01:11.137 --> 01:12.838
Well, those of us in the prime of life

01:12.839 --> 01:14.006
don't have time for this! Ugh!

01:14.007 --> 01:15.707
I got to get out of these church clothes.

01:15.708 --> 01:16.842
It's like fire on my body!

01:16.843 --> 01:18.343
Sue: Yeah, look, I got to get home.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.712
I'm designing my senior
page for the yearbook.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.347
I'm gonna have inspirational
quotes in the corners

01:22.348 --> 01:24.016
and then my silhouette in
the center of the page

01:24.017 --> 01:25.851
and then my name going down the side

01:25.852 --> 01:27.819
with a word for each letter.

01:27.820 --> 01:30.088
S-u-e. "So ugly every day."

01:30.089 --> 01:31.089
You're welcome. Mom!

01:31.090 --> 01:32.090
Mike. Axl.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.225
[Gasps] Oh!

01:33.226 --> 01:34.693
And I didn't even tell you the best part.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.762
Brad and I are gonna go out
to the big polyurethane cow

01:36.763 --> 01:39.398
and sit on top of it wearing sombreros!

01:39.399 --> 01:40.399
Ha!

01:40.400 --> 01:41.466
Shh! Don't tell anybody.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.668
Why are you wearing sombreros?

01:42.669 --> 01:43.669
Because it's funny.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.703
Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

01:44.704 --> 01:45.904
Uh, I'm pretty sure it is.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.205
You guys think it's funny, right?

01:47.206 --> 01:48.807
I don't think anything is funny.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.944
Okay. We're wearing sombreros
because it's seÃ±or cow.

01:52.945 --> 01:56.948
SeÃ±or? Because we're seniors?

01:56.949 --> 01:58.817
Get it?

01:58.818 --> 01:59.851
Save your energy, Sue.

01:59.852 --> 02:01.219
It's never gonna be as good as mine.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.288
Just drew a big picture of
the buttronauts and said,

02:03.289 --> 02:04.456
"see you on the backside."

02:04.457 --> 02:07.426
I hate myself, but that is funny.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.794
Aww, that's where there
used to be that corn stand

02:09.795 --> 02:12.097
where we'd buy that really
good corn, remember?

02:12.098 --> 02:14.199
Yeah, that sure was good corn.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.401
What did I tell you? Death drive.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.236
Oh, Axl, I need you to go back to school

02:18.237 --> 02:19.838
and pick up the sombrero that dad

02:19.839 --> 02:21.740
brought back from
gatlinburg for my picture.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.675
Remember, you took it up to school?

02:23.676 --> 02:26.111
Even though I told you it was
special and not to take it?

02:26.112 --> 02:27.412
God, whatever. Fine.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.914
Seriously, guys... you're
not gonna top the corn.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.716
You've had your little
drive down geriatric lane.

02:30.717 --> 02:31.883
How about we wrap this thing up?

02:31.884 --> 02:33.752
Hey, every time someone complains,

02:33.753 --> 02:35.053
we're adding 20 minutes to the drive.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.188
You wouldn't.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.689
I got a full tank and an empty bladder.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.359
- I can go all day.
- [Kids groan]

02:40.360 --> 02:41.760
Frankie: So, the Sunday drive

02:41.761 --> 02:44.429
didn't exactly make the
memories we were hoping for.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.865
- [Door closes]
- But it did have one unexpected benefit.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.401
Oh, hi, dad. Just walking to the library.

02:49.402 --> 02:52.270
I know I said I might
need a ride, but I don't.

02:52.271 --> 02:53.805
Happy to walk.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.807
Happy to walk everywhere
from now on, actually.

02:55.808 --> 02:58.143
So how come I'm getting a
letter from the school

02:58.144 --> 02:59.978
addressed to "the parents of Brick Heck"?

02:59.979 --> 03:02.314
What weird stuff did you do now?

03:02.315 --> 03:03.815
It really could have been
any number of things.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.717
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

03:05.718 --> 03:09.721
How about you stay here while
we find out why you...

03:09.722 --> 03:13.191
Got "athlete of the month"?

03:13.192 --> 03:14.793
What the hell?

03:14.794 --> 03:18.363
Athlete of the month? Really? Hmm.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.698
I don't get it.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.701
Was it a written-test sort of thing?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.369
Did they move you to the special gym class?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.871
'Cause that has been discussed.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.707
No, but come to think of it,
I have kind of been doing

03:28.708 --> 03:30.041
what I'm supposed to be doing lately.

03:30.042 --> 03:32.744
Instead of faking a stomach cramp
and reading on the toilet,

03:32.745 --> 03:34.012
I've actually been participating.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.014
Really?

03:36.682 --> 03:39.351
Hmm. Nice medal.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.686
If I had known sports had
such interesting fonts,

03:41.687 --> 03:43.188
I would have gotten involved
in a basketball match

03:43.189 --> 03:44.257
a lot sooner.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.296
Thanks. Thanks a lot. We're very proud.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.964
- We are? Ooh.
- [Beep]

03:52.965 --> 03:54.366
What are we proud of?

03:54.367 --> 03:55.667
So, I talked to the P.E. teacher.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.335
And apparently, it's legit.

03:57.336 --> 03:59.171
He says he likes what
he's been seeing lately

03:59.172 --> 04:02.240
and he felt Brick earned
athlete of the month.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.409
[Chuckles] That's great. Odd, but great.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.410
Right?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.745
But, you know, come to think of it,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.246
I've noticed him getting stronger lately.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.081
The other day, he popped
the top off a pudding cup

04:10.082 --> 04:11.249
like it was nothin'.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.218
It's still Brick, Mike.
Don't get too excited.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.753
I know. I know. But think about it.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.689
It's possible the genes
are just kicking in late.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.991
I mean, I didn't hit 6 feet till
halfway through high school.

04:19.992 --> 04:21.827
So who knows, Frankie?

04:21.827 --> 04:24.830
He might just be my kid after all.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.833
Yep, Mike was feeling
pretty good about Brick.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.835
And I was feeling pretty
good about the triple Decker

04:29.836 --> 04:32.003
bacon burger I snagged on my way home.

04:32.004 --> 04:34.005
I'd been craving one since Mike
wouldn't let us stop there

04:34.006 --> 04:36.675
during our lame Sunday-drive idea.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.443
Stupid integrity.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.779
[Indistinct shouting]

04:40.780 --> 04:43.448
I'm not hungry, so you guys
are on your own for dinner!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.116
Sue: All you ever do is think of yourself!

04:45.117 --> 04:47.686
Axl: You already have like
a gazillion pictures!

04:47.687 --> 04:48.920
Besides, high school doesn't even matter.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.722
Just wait till you get to college.
That's what matters.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.057
You always say that!

04:52.058 --> 04:53.758
You said it when I was
in elementary school,

04:53.759 --> 04:54.893
you're saying it when I'm in high school.

04:54.894 --> 04:57.062
Apparently, whatever stage of life I'm in

04:57.063 --> 04:59.130
is the one that doesn't really matter!

04:59.131 --> 05:00.298
Mom, Axl drove back to campus

05:00.299 --> 05:02.100
and didn't bring back the sombrero!

05:02.101 --> 05:05.670
What? Axl, why would you go all
the way up there and not get it?

05:05.671 --> 05:06.972
Look, I am on my mid-semester break.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.140
I'm here to eat free food
and have you do my laundry,

05:09.141 --> 05:11.443
not be harassed with all
these demands! [Sighs]

05:11.444 --> 05:13.678
I went for a quick trip to get
my Japanese throwing stars,

05:13.679 --> 05:15.680
and I forgot to look for
the stupid sombrero!

05:15.681 --> 05:17.315
Okay, Sue, he forgot.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.784
Hey, why don't you guys wear
Sailor hats and sit on the cow?

05:19.785 --> 05:21.786
I'm sure Brad has a couple
of those lying around.

05:21.787 --> 05:23.288
That would be funny.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.789
Yeah, Brad's got like a
hundred sailor hats.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.791
But tell me, how would that be funny?

05:26.792 --> 05:29.294
Sailor cow? Yeah, that makes sense.

05:29.295 --> 05:33.398
I told him I needed that
sombrero, but he doesn't listen!

05:33.399 --> 05:34.799
Mom, you know that is true.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.835
He never listens to me!

05:36.836 --> 05:37.836
Okay, okay, okay!

05:37.837 --> 05:39.671
Axl, maybe you could go
back up and get the hat.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.007
That would be a nice thing
to do for your sister.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.376
I'm not even sure I have it
anymore, you mental case.

05:44.377 --> 05:48.213
What? You lost the family sombrero?!

05:48.214 --> 05:50.749
I don't know! Look, we were
celebrating cinco de February

05:50.750 --> 05:52.217
and it might have been used as a dip bowl.

05:52.218 --> 05:55.220
Oh, my God, mom, why is she
being so nuts about this?

05:55.221 --> 05:56.888
You have to understand, Axl,

05:56.889 --> 05:59.824
this is Sue's senior year and
it's really important to her.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.826
Maybe we could just find another sombrero.

06:01.827 --> 06:03.461
But that's the one that
means something to me!

06:03.462 --> 06:06.464
I can't just sit on the
cow in a random sombrero!

06:06.465 --> 06:08.300
Axl, think! Did hutch put it somewhere?!

06:08.301 --> 06:11.069
- Did you put it somewhere?! Did Kenny...
- Shut up! Shut her up!

06:11.070 --> 06:12.771
- Sue, just...
- Oh, why are you taking his side?!

06:12.772 --> 06:13.872
I'm not! I understand you're upset!

06:13.873 --> 06:16.041
- Why are you taking her side?!
- I'm not taking her side.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.375
- I'm just trying to...
- Oh, mom!

06:17.376 --> 06:20.078
Stop! Forget it. You don't get it.

06:20.079 --> 06:23.415
Yeah, you really don't.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.084
I can't win, Mike. I just can't win.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.919
They drag me into the
middle of their fights

06:27.920 --> 06:29.688
and then they take it all out on me.

06:29.689 --> 06:30.755
I'm telling you,

06:30.756 --> 06:32.757
I really got to fan the
flames of this Brick thing.

06:32.758 --> 06:34.125
I was thinking of taking him out,

06:34.126 --> 06:36.828
- find out what sport he's best suited to.
- I mean, sure.

06:36.829 --> 06:38.096
They act like they want my help.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.264
They don't want my help.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.800
I'm not saying football. That's nuts.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.768
And by the way, who
brings back one sombrero?

06:43.769 --> 06:45.236
You don't bring a sombrero back

06:45.237 --> 06:47.439
unless you've got sombreros for everybody.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.007
What are you talking about?

06:49.008 --> 06:51.176
Axl and Sue. What are you talking about?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.012
Brick. Did you forget our son
won athlete of the month?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.380
[Scoffs]

06:55.381 --> 06:57.716
Sure, it's for February, the
shortest month, but still.

06:57.717 --> 06:58.883
Yeah, yeah, it's whack-a-mole, Mike.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.085
Oh, Brick's doing good,

07:00.086 --> 07:02.153
but the other two are ripping
each other to shreds.

07:02.154 --> 07:03.254
When is it gonna end?

07:03.255 --> 07:05.090
Right now they're fighting over a sombrero.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.758
Next thing, they're
fighting over our caskets.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.927
We're not gonna be around forever.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.095
I'm hearing we won't be
around to hear 'em fight.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.263
[Sighs] This is serious, Mike.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.799
They're going to the
same college next year.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.801
I mean, I'm sick of being in the middle

07:16.802 --> 07:19.170
and trying to defend everybody.

07:19.171 --> 07:20.872
Well, who's in the wrong here?

07:20.873 --> 07:23.008
I don't know. Sue's being a
little nutso about the hat.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.709
It's really not that big of a deal.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.845
Okay. That's what you should have told Axl.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.680
What? No. No way.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.315
Why not? [Scoffs]

07:30.316 --> 07:33.318
Because you don't badmouth
one kid to the other, Mike.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.853
- You just don't.
- I don't know.

07:34.854 --> 07:36.688
If you're just playing everybody's side,

07:36.689 --> 07:37.789
what good are you?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.991
If they're looking to you
for an honest opinion,

07:39.992 --> 07:41.926
maybe it's not a bad idea to just give it.

07:41.927 --> 07:43.795
Might help them wrap it up faster.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.263
[Sighs]

07:45.264 --> 07:46.765
Hey, you should listen to me.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.769
The kid I'm in charge of is on fire.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.673
[Grunts]

07:56.143 --> 07:57.376
I guess when you're a mom,

07:57.377 --> 07:58.911
it's hard to see your kids as adults,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.146
no matter how old they are.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.947
But Mike was right... they were growing up,

08:01.948 --> 08:05.143
and maybe it was time to start
treating them that way.

08:05.144 --> 08:06.217
[Grunts]

08:06.218 --> 08:08.104
- Hi, you got a second?
- Sure.

08:08.105 --> 08:09.220
Here, hold your arms like this.

08:09.221 --> 08:10.322
I'll throw one right through.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.690
Yeah, not happening.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.159
Listen, I just wanted to talk to you

08:14.160 --> 08:15.860
about what went down before,

08:15.861 --> 08:17.729
about the whole sombrero thing.

08:17.730 --> 08:21.232
Ugh, I am this close to finding
a new place to do my laundry.

08:21.233 --> 08:24.736
Look, I just want you to know
it may not seem like it,

08:24.737 --> 08:27.672
but I understand your frustration, okay?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.975
You know I love Sue with all my heart.

08:29.976 --> 08:34.145
But believe me, I am very aware
that she can be a little...

08:34.145 --> 08:36.114
Relentless.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.783
Yes! Thank you!

08:38.784 --> 08:40.217
I know.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.953
She gets a hold of something,
and she will not let it go.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.356
She's all, "wah, wah,
wah, it's my senior year!

08:44.357 --> 08:46.157
Let's have a weekly game night!

08:46.158 --> 08:48.126
You guys, we have to help Africa!"

08:48.127 --> 08:49.828
But that's just who she is.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.197
She's like an excited, confused puppy

08:52.198 --> 08:55.266
who's running in all directions,
bumping into walls.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.635
Finally! [Chuckles]

08:56.636 --> 08:57.769
So, what do you want to do about it?

08:57.770 --> 08:59.104
Should we remove her from society,

08:59.105 --> 09:01.673
- scoop out a part of her brain?
- Look, I get it.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.342
I know sometimes it can
be very annoying for you,

09:04.343 --> 09:06.645
but you're two years older.

09:06.646 --> 09:09.114
So, maybe the next time she's being all Sue

09:09.115 --> 09:10.615
and getting on your nerves,

09:10.616 --> 09:14.285
you can just take a deep breath
and let it roll off your back.

09:14.286 --> 09:16.054
Be the bigger person.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.691
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

09:19.692 --> 09:20.692
Oh, great.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.826
See, isn't this nice

09:21.827 --> 09:23.695
when we can talk to each other like adults?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.863
- Mm-hmm.
- [Chuckles]

09:24.864 --> 09:27.032
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

09:27.033 --> 09:31.002
Let's make this an outside toy.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.104
So, Brick, listen.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.106
Since you won this award, I was
thinking we should get out there

09:35.107 --> 09:37.575
and, you know, practice some stuff.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.177
What sport would you say you're best at?

09:39.178 --> 09:41.346
Hmm.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.314
I'd have to say tennis.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.650
Tennis? Makes sense.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.585
More of a gentleman's
sport, less about power,

09:47.586 --> 09:48.720
more about hand-eye coordination.

09:48.721 --> 09:49.722
Catch.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.758
All right. Still got stuff to work on.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.760
But at least you didn't scream that time.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.729
So... Progress.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.932
Hmm.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.006
"Relentless"? You think I am relentless?!

10:08.007 --> 10:09.674
What are you talking about?

10:09.675 --> 10:10.675
Axl said you said I'm relentless!

10:10.676 --> 10:12.744
Is that true? Did you say that, mom?

10:12.745 --> 10:13.978
Did you really say that?

10:13.979 --> 10:17.015
W-w-well... Yes, but I was said
it in a completely positive way,

10:17.016 --> 10:20.685
like "relentless" being
strong and never giving up.

10:20.686 --> 10:21.986
There are so many people
who are relentless...

10:21.987 --> 10:26.057
Hillary Clinton is relentless,
Eleanor Roosevelt, relentless,

10:26.058 --> 10:27.726
that girl who got her arm bit off
by a shark and is still surfing.

10:27.727 --> 10:28.860
How relentless is that?

10:28.861 --> 10:31.696
I mean, there are so
many relentless heroes.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.199
But there are better words
to use than "relentless."

10:34.200 --> 10:35.967
There's "driven," there's "tenacious"...

10:35.968 --> 10:37.969
Really? You think "tenacious"
is better than "relentless"?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.305
My grandma used to call me
relentless all the time.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.307
"I love you, you're so relentless."

10:42.308 --> 10:43.675
I liked it.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.310
Oh, we'd laugh and have
hot chocolate together.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.678
You want some hot chocolate?

10:46.679 --> 10:48.980
Well, then how come you
never said it to me,

10:48.981 --> 10:50.348
but you said it to Axl?

10:50.349 --> 10:51.716
'Cause I say all kinds of things

10:51.717 --> 10:52.884
about you guys to each other.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.754
Did he also say I love you?
'Cause I also said I love you.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.021
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

10:57.022 --> 10:58.156
Do other people say "relentless"?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.357
Did dad say it? Has a teacher ever said it?

10:59.358 --> 11:01.926
Did you read it in a
progress report somewhere?

11:01.927 --> 11:03.294
No, no, no.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.964
It's my own great, really
positive word just for you.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.766
Axl didn't say it like
it's a positive thing.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.567
Well, you kids and your slang.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.903
"Bad," "phat"... now
"sick" is a good thing.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.271
[Chuckling] I was late to that one.

11:13.272 --> 11:14.773
Well, clearly you said "relentless"

11:14.774 --> 11:16.174
and that's a person who
can't let go of things,

11:16.175 --> 11:17.275
and I let things go.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.244
"Let it Go" from "Frozen"
is my favorite song,

11:19.245 --> 11:21.746
and how could it be my favorite
song if I didn't let things go?

11:21.747 --> 11:24.083
That wouldn't make any sense. [Scoffs]

11:26.218 --> 11:27.720
This isn't over!

11:33.125 --> 11:36.661
All right, Brick. This is important.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.197
Sports is a great teacher of life.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.833
It teaches you that there's
winners and there's losers.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.702
And it's very clear... if you
don't win, you're a loser.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.171
Your mom will tell you it's
how you play the game.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.172
She's wrong.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.073
Got it. Yeah, you do.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.608
Now you won athlete of the month,

11:50.609 --> 11:52.744
you got a little taste, you might
even want to win it again.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.813
I mean, your coach isn't one of those guys

11:54.814 --> 11:57.015
that makes sure everybody
gets it once, is he?

11:57.016 --> 11:59.184
No, no. You really have to earn it.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.285
All right. Get your stuff out.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.619
Let's do this. Let's have some fun.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.622
Ahh.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.658
What are those?

12:06.659 --> 12:07.959
Oh, books about tennis.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.661
I've got the Arthur Ashe biography,

12:09.662 --> 12:11.329
"So You Want to Play Tennis,"

12:11.330 --> 12:13.665
and "The Grapes of Wrath"
in case these are boring.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.300
W-where's your racket?

12:15.301 --> 12:17.035
I'm sorry. What do you mean?

12:17.036 --> 12:19.704
Uh, I said, "we're gonna go out and hit."

12:19.705 --> 12:20.805
Yeah, hit the books.

12:20.806 --> 12:23.141
I don't do anything without
reading about it first.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.677
I...Can't believe you
didn't bring a racket.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.579
I know I saw you put a
can of balls in there.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.581
Oh, no.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.915
This is pringles,

12:30.916 --> 12:33.251
in case we get hungry from
reading and need a snack.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.353
All right.

12:35.354 --> 12:36.721
Knock, knock.

12:36.722 --> 12:39.257
Remember, I promised you a cup
of hot chocolate yesterday?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.626
I made a smiley face with
the little marshmallows

12:41.627 --> 12:43.628
- the way you like.
- No, thank you.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.663
I'm putting together a list of 100 reasons

12:45.664 --> 12:47.732
why I am not relentless.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.701
[Sighs]

12:49.702 --> 12:52.871
Listen, Sue.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.839
I'm sorry.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.975
I shouldn't have talked to Axl about you.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.677
It was just wrong, and I
don't know why I did it.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.847
And I should have known
better, 'cause the truth is,

13:02.848 --> 13:06.848
I love your brother, but he
can be kind of a jackass.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.854
Oh, thank you!

13:09.855 --> 13:12.724
Sometimes I think I am the
only one that notices.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.226
Oh, no, trust me. We all notice.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.895
But the thing you have to remember

13:16.896 --> 13:18.897
is that even though you're younger,

13:18.898 --> 13:21.099
you're way more mature than he is.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.569
He's 20, but he can be a bit of a baby.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.671
But listen, we don't need to talk about it.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.006
Nobody needs to say anything.

13:28.007 --> 13:29.841
It'll be just something that we...

13:29.842 --> 13:31.175
Axl, mom thinks you're a jackass!

13:31.176 --> 13:32.644
- What?
- Yeah.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.646
- She just told me.
- Uh, uh, no.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.114
Here's the thing...

13:36.115 --> 13:38.283
Well, did mom tell you she
said you were a dumb puppy?

13:38.284 --> 13:39.284
[Gasps] What?

13:39.285 --> 13:40.618
I didn't say "dumb."

13:40.619 --> 13:42.253
I said "excited and cute."

13:42.254 --> 13:44.889
Who doesn't want to be compared to a puppy?

13:44.890 --> 13:47.759
Well, did mom tell you she
called you a big baby?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.761
Oh, yeah? I'm a baby?

13:49.762 --> 13:52.330
You're a baby!

13:52.331 --> 13:53.831
I said "a bit of a baby"!

13:53.832 --> 13:55.733
We should all strive to be more childlike.

13:55.734 --> 13:57.035
It's magical!

13:57.036 --> 13:58.036
[Door slams]

13:58.037 --> 13:59.704
[Door slams]

13:59.705 --> 14:01.039
[Sighs]

14:01.040 --> 14:04.242
I don't know, Brad. It's
higher than I thought.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.577
We have to do this, Sue.
It's super important.

14:06.578 --> 14:07.779
When we're older,

14:07.780 --> 14:10.114
we're gonna look at our
yearbooks all the time.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.649
[Sighs] I'm just sorry

14:11.650 --> 14:14.285
I don't have my good
sombrero from Gatlinburg.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.688
But it was really nice of
the manager at Taco Jason's

14:16.689 --> 14:17.989
to let me borrow this off the wall.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.325
[Sighs] No, I'm the one who's sorry, Sue.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.660
Ohh, the sombrero is the
only hat I only have one of.

14:22.661 --> 14:23.795
It's all right.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.731
Let's just do this quick
before somebody sees us.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.234
[Crow caws]

14:30.235 --> 14:33.604
Come on. Come on. Hurry, Brad.

14:33.605 --> 14:34.906
Don't worry, I've got plenty of...

14:34.907 --> 14:36.908
[camera shutter clicks]

14:36.909 --> 14:38.609
Do you think it took yet?

14:38.610 --> 14:40.912
I don't know how much longer
I can sit in this crow poop.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.747
Oh, I know. It's disgusting.

14:42.748 --> 14:44.615
Somebody should clean this thing.

14:44.616 --> 14:45.917
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

14:45.918 --> 14:48.252
We should start a community
project to clean the cow.

14:48.253 --> 14:50.254
[Gasps] Sue, that is a great idea!

14:50.255 --> 14:52.256
Love, love, love.

14:52.257 --> 14:54.092
Okay, it has to have taken by now.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.660
Yeah. [Sighs]

14:55.661 --> 14:56.661
[Camera shutter clicks]

14:56.662 --> 14:57.829
Eight Mississippi,

14:57.830 --> 15:00.665
seven Mississippi, six Mississippi...
okay, okay.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.167
Five... no, no! Hey, no, no, no! Shh! Shh!

15:03.168 --> 15:05.336
Get out of here! Hey! Shoo!

15:05.337 --> 15:08.039
Woof, woof! Woof, woof!

15:08.040 --> 15:09.707
What are crows scared of?

15:09.708 --> 15:10.708
[Gasps] Scarecrows!

15:10.709 --> 15:12.143
- Ooh. Right, right, right.
- [Clears throat]

15:12.144 --> 15:15.947
âª I could wile away the hours,
conferring with the flowers âª

15:15.948 --> 15:17.749
âª Consulting with the rain âª

15:17.750 --> 15:18.683
[Drumming]

15:18.684 --> 15:20.351
âª And my head, I'd be scratching âª

15:20.352 --> 15:21.953
âª While my thoughts were busy hatching âª

15:21.954 --> 15:24.789
âª If I only had a brain âª

15:24.790 --> 15:27.025
[Camera shutter clicks]

15:27.026 --> 15:28.726
Okay, okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.194
Oh, my God! I think this is it!

15:30.195 --> 15:33.698
I know. Okay. Hand on hip, arm up, smile!

15:33.699 --> 15:35.033
Ooh, wait. The ladder's in the picture.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.668
[Gasps] Oh!

15:37.669 --> 15:38.669
[Ladder clatters]

15:38.670 --> 15:40.671
- OlÃ©!
- OlÃ©!

15:40.672 --> 15:42.740
[Camera shutter clicks]

15:42.741 --> 15:44.742
Oh, my God! We did it! Oh, my God! Yeah!

15:44.743 --> 15:47.045
[Laughs] We rule! SeÃ±or Cow!

15:47.046 --> 15:49.013
Okay. All right.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.749
Oh.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.290
So, when you're really in trouble,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.264
who do you call that you know
will always be there for you

16:01.265 --> 16:02.800
no matter what you've been through?

16:03.558 --> 16:07.501
Well, first you call mom,
then dad, grandma, grandpa...

16:07.502 --> 16:09.538
- [Car door closes]
- ...Other grandpa, reverend Timtom,

16:09.539 --> 16:11.547
Rusty, Carly, Nancy Donahue,

16:11.548 --> 16:15.321
the manager at Taco Jason's...
then finally, Axl.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.123
Hey, losers. How bad do
you want to get down?

16:18.124 --> 16:19.950
Let the bidding begin.

16:22.769 --> 16:24.176
[TV chatter]

16:24.690 --> 16:26.406
- There's my boy.
- [Door closes]

16:26.407 --> 16:27.652
And still wearing his gym clothes.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.120
Yeah, I had gym last period

16:29.121 --> 16:30.888
and I couldn't find my pants again.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.724
Eh, that's okay, you...

16:32.725 --> 16:35.961
You... Brick, why does it say
"Tobolski" on your shorts?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.497
Oh, he's my gym locker partner.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.666
He keeps taking my shorts,
so I just wear his.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.867
Wait.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.103
You're wearing his shorts,
and he's wearing yours?

16:45.104 --> 16:46.604
That is correct.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.106
Let me ask you something, Brick.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.141
Is this kid Tobolski a good athlete?

16:50.142 --> 16:51.642
Oh, yeah.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.644
When we run the mile, he's
definitely in front of the pack.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.646
I usually just run a few
feet and then disappear

16:55.647 --> 16:56.681
in the bushes, where I've hidden a book.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.782
Smart, huh?

16:57.783 --> 16:59.484
Mm-hmm, and what did your teacher say

16:59.485 --> 17:00.985
about you wearing each others' shorts?

17:00.986 --> 17:02.220
Well, he doesn't really know us,

17:02.221 --> 17:04.188
so he just shouts out whatever
name's on our shorts.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.190
- Aha. So he calls you...?
- Tobolski.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.657
And he calls Tobolski...?

17:07.659 --> 17:08.693
Heck, I guess.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.560
Again, I'm not always around to see it

17:10.561 --> 17:11.996
'cause I'm frequently faking a leg cramp

17:11.997 --> 17:13.598
to get a banana from the nurse's office.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.867
[Clicks tongue] Brick, don't you get it?

17:17.236 --> 17:20.605
Ohh. So you're saying...

17:20.606 --> 17:21.638
That's right.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.509
You didn't win that medal. Your shorts did.

17:24.510 --> 17:28.146
Wow. So I did that whole
jumping Jack for nothing?

17:29.481 --> 17:30.783
Hmm.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.852
You're not really gonna
take my $10, are you?

17:34.853 --> 17:36.020
I'm not a monster.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.855
You can pay me back in installments.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.525
[Chuckles] I'm just kidding.

17:40.526 --> 17:44.228
Despite what mom says, I'm
not that much of a jackass.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.731
She doesn't really think you're a jackass.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.033
She was just saying that
to make me feel better

17:49.034 --> 17:50.568
about being relentless.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.204
Well, hey, you're not...

17:53.205 --> 17:55.039
W... [Chuckles]

17:55.040 --> 17:56.541
You've got a lot of good qualities.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.176
Oh, no.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.812
I know I was bugging you
about the sombrero.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.549
Ugh. I should have brought it
home, but I really did forget.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.518
You know, I don't get it.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.720
Why is mom always up in
our business, anyway?

18:09.721 --> 18:13.057
Probably 'cause she doesn't
want us to grow up.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.159
I mean, she's been a mom forever.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.527
It's all she knows.

18:16.528 --> 18:18.629
God, that's sad. Ugh.

18:18.630 --> 18:21.799
And once I'm gone, she's only
gonna have Brick to focus on.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.468
Poor guy.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.671
Hey, maybe once we're both up at college,

18:26.672 --> 18:28.005
I could pick you up from your dorm

18:28.006 --> 18:30.007
and we can drive home
every once in a while.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.943
You know, let mom do a little mothering.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.544
Yeah, that's a good idea.

18:33.545 --> 18:34.745
Yeah.

18:36.148 --> 18:40.224
So... I will be seeing you at college?

18:40.225 --> 18:41.486
[Breathes deeply]

18:41.487 --> 18:44.555
Well, I know where a lot of stuff is.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.059
You'll probably get lost a
lot, so, yeah, probably.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.728
Well, that would be nice.

18:50.729 --> 18:53.064
[Inhales deeply]

18:53.065 --> 18:55.900
Hey, this isn't the way home.
Where are we going?

18:55.901 --> 18:58.903
Nowhere. It's a nice day out.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.807
I thought it would be nice
to drive around for a bit.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.145
Okay.

What's that move called again?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.190
A lay-up.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.892
And that's worth two points, right?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.527
Yes, always worth two points,

19:22.528 --> 19:24.529
unless you're beyond the three-point line.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.531
And where is that?

19:26.532 --> 19:28.499
You really want to know this stuff?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.834
Yeah. I really do.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.536
Okay.

19:31.537 --> 19:36.007
Three-point line is way back here.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.543
Three, two, one.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.545
Whoa. [Laughs]

19:40.546 --> 19:42.480
Can I try one?

19:42.481 --> 19:44.115
Sure.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.785
As a rookie, you're gonna want
to be closer to the basket.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.153
There you go.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.056
Here?

19:52.057 --> 19:54.725
Whoa. Okay. Well, it wasn't bad.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.227
Your form is good.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.229
You're just gonna want to get
a little more behind it.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.565
I think you've got my
follow-through, though.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.567
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.535
I think I need to work on
keeping my eyes open, though.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.870
Yeah. Work on that later.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.039
Heck with the game on the line...

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
[Grunts]

20:09.041 --> 20:10.575
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

20:10.576 --> 20:12.877
- The crowd goes wild!
- Yes.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.546
Young Heck in his first game ever.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.215
- Do it again?
- Yeah, I hope so.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.483
Okay.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.522
[TV chatter] Oh, good.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.490
You're back. Listen, I'm out.

20:26.491 --> 20:27.959
I'm out!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.595
You two are gonna stop putting
me in the middle of your crap.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.263
All I wanted was for you two to get along.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.531
What's so wrong about that?

20:33.532 --> 20:35.533
And you're gonna need to get along,

20:35.534 --> 20:36.667
'cause let me tell you something.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.536
The world is an open sewer,

20:38.537 --> 20:41.606
and the only ones that are gonna
fish you out are your family.

20:41.607 --> 20:44.742
Ugh, look at your faces. You don't care.
Fine. Fine.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.776
Why am I even talking?

20:45.777 --> 20:47.612
Love each other, don't love each other.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.748
It's your life. I'm out. I'm out!

20:52.484 --> 20:54.652
Look, you know how I
feel about your mother,

20:54.653 --> 20:56.153
but here's the thing...

20:56.154 --> 20:59.657
She can sometimes be... a little unhinged.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.726
- Mm, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- I can see that.

21:01.727 --> 21:04.061
- Still love her, but... You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.229
Must be hard sometimes.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.231
- Yeah. She gets crazy.
- Sometimes, it is.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.350
She is a little crazy.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.701
Well, I didn't say "crazy."
I said "unhinged."

21:10.702 --> 21:13.237
But forget I ever said that. No, thanks.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.673
