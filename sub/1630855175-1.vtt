00:13.764 --> 00:15.182
Ethan.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.604
Yeah, that's it. It's perfect. I knew it.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.899
-That's the Cadillac of wet suits.
-Thanks, Mom.

00:23.982 --> 00:28.946
You grew, like, an inch.
My baby's a big boy.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.864
-Not a white one…
-No? Go on.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.824
…because typically
the white ones get pulled over more.

00:32.908 --> 00:33.909
I don't know why. I--

00:33.992 --> 00:35.452
-Chunky…
-Hey.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.746
…I invited you to Thanksgiving,
don't make me regret it.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.666
Come on. Don't talk business.
You're driving me crazy.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.875
Not a long drive.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.336
Those are my grandma's napkin rings.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.714
-Come on, help me.
-It's almost ready.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.091
Mommy.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.178
If it's still dry after all of this,
I'm gonna kill the thing again.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.430
-It won't be dry.
-Wow.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.016
You look fucking gorgeous.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.518
You're flirting with me.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.020
You're irresistible. May I?

01:02.104 --> 01:05.274
Just saying it's a fucking lot of work
for a mediocre piece of meat,

01:05.357 --> 01:06.483
that's all I gotta say.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.902
Here, Denny, here. Baste.

01:08.986 --> 01:09.987
-What's this?
-Be right back.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.030
I'm gonna go check on Sheila in the pool.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.995
-What am I gonna do with this?
-Just baste it. Pour--

01:18.078 --> 01:20.998
You know, pour the sauce on it.
Do I have to fucking do everything?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.749
-Hey!
-Hi!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.794
Okay, go help yourself
to drinks at the bar.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.754
By the way, the table looks beautiful.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.299
These are amazing. This is new.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.051
Oh, Peg. I love these.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.763
Stop it. You got this shot?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.974
-I need a copy, like, right away.
-Okay.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.310
-You gotta get me a copy.
-No!

01:41.393 --> 01:42.853
-Come on!
-Yeah!

01:43.645 --> 01:45.564
-Fuck.
-Anybody leave in a stretcher yet?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.734
Hey, you two, did you see
Grandma's napkin rings on the table?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.444
-They look amazing.
-You see, Stewie?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.528
Yeah. Looks great, Peg.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.574
Hey! No. Kids, do not drown each other.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.202
Anybody ends up dead,
you're gonna have a problem with me.

01:58.911 --> 02:03.749
Here. Bob for apples. That's safe, okay?

02:04.416 --> 02:07.836
Hey, Ethan. No.
Wait for Denny to come out to help you.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.088
-Denny!
-Peggy, this is some house.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.924
Tell me about it. It ought to be.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.176
I told you it was a showplace.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.263
The fuck is he? Denny! Denny!

02:33.987 --> 02:38.909
DEA with a search warrant. Demand entry!
DEA with a search warrant. Demand entry!

02:38.992 --> 02:39.993
Blue pig!

02:41.203 --> 02:43.413
Blue pig! Blue pig! Blue pig.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.874
-Peg, master toilet.
-Mommy!

02:45.958 --> 02:48.252
Chunky, pool filter. Let's go!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.671
Catch up with Mommy. Now!

02:50.754 --> 02:53.757
-Davey. Let's go!
-Get out of the pool!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.759
-Out of the pool!
-Don't panic. It's okay!

02:55.843 --> 02:56.885
Get the dog.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.804
Let's dry off. Okay, baby?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.682
-Let's go, guys. Come on.
-Goddamn it. Come on, people.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.309
Okay, guys.
Let's get out of here. I'll wrap you up.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.602
Careful! Come on!

03:05.686 --> 03:07.312
Davey, get your towel. Let's go.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.522
Breach!

03:08.605 --> 03:11.191
This is DEA! We have a warrant!
We're coming in!

03:16.280 --> 03:19.783
I asked you to spring for a stash house!
I begged you!

03:23.287 --> 03:26.540
My kid is visiting.
You ruined the holiday, Denny.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.083
It's not me, it's the plumbing.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.294
It's too fucking much!

03:30.878 --> 03:31.879
Mommy!

03:33.297 --> 03:35.090
Hey, happy fucking Thanksgiving,
by the way.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.508
Never again.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.386
-I know.
-Goddamn it.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.929
Mommy!

04:23.555 --> 04:25.974
I know you want one. Smile, okay?

04:26.058 --> 04:27.935
Now, you folks, don't miss the gift shop.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.647
We got new Pioneertown T-shirts
and beach towels.

04:32.189 --> 04:35.442
Wait till you see me in this show.
You're not gonna believe it's me.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.820
Hey, no spoilers, but there may be flying.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.447
There could be gunshots.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.032
…with their boots on.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.200
Cell phones, Peggy.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.037
It's my brother. He needs directions.
He's coming with my sister today.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.957
Yep, but there's no cell phones
on the frontier, Peggy.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.712
I finally got privacy for once
in my fucking life.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.258
So, how's the hotel? It's nice, right?

04:59.842 --> 05:03.303
That's where Mommy and I stayed
when we moved from New York.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.055
With the sunken tub.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.140
To keep their families fed,

05:07.224 --> 05:11.144
frontier ladies had to do all sorts
of smoking, canning

05:11.228 --> 05:12.896
and, of course, baking.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.525
They had one surefire way to know
that their stove was ready.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.652
If you can hold your hand in it

05:18.735 --> 05:21.905
-and count to ten, it's not hot enough.
-Count to ten. Not hot enough.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.323
You wanna count with me?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.077
Ready? Goddamn it, Tammy!

05:27.160 --> 05:31.498
Mother-fuck-me.
Fucking can't stand this shit.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.376
Goddamn it.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.424
Oh, shit. I'll see you after the show.
Okay. Gotta go.

05:47.723 --> 05:51.268
What did he do now?
Duck his child support payment?

05:53.187 --> 05:54.479
He hit Brian.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.860
Kid came home yesterday with a black eye.
He wouldn't even go to school today.

05:59.943 --> 06:03.155
Okay, no. We're taking him to court.
You're getting full custody.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.990
I can't afford a lawyer.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.493
And that stupid PI I hired
won't even call me back.

06:08.577 --> 06:12.122
I gave him a $300 retainer
to catch Billy doing anything

06:12.206 --> 06:14.124
and now I can't pay rent.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.626
For fuck's sakes.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.712
I could prove he's a criminal.
How hard is that?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.715
So, what's this fucking Columbo's name?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.967
Bruce Harvey. Private investigator.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.430
What the fuck, Jeannie?
I'm in there alone. Can you come back?

06:28.514 --> 06:31.517
-Shut the fuck up, Tammy. Just shh.
-I burned my hand. Just go back inside.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.521
I don't even need this job.
My fiancé's loaded.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.482
He is. See that?

06:39.691 --> 06:40.901
It's pretty, Tammy.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.653
It's a gift from GB.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.197
And I've got two more gifts coming,
if you know what I mean.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.867
-What's GB? A jewelry store?
-Guru Bob, my boyfriend.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.537
They say diamonds are forever, right?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.915
Are moonstones forever?
'Cause that's what you got on your finger.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.461
-I don't think so. GB knows jewels.
-Okay.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.712
He knows everything.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.382
Does he know not to go around
calling himself "Guru"?

07:03.465 --> 07:07.010
Other people call him that!
He's very famous.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.804
He used to be on the news.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.264
Bob and Barb at Five.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.890
Channel 18.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.601
Everything is stupid.
Everything is stupid.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.019
The "Everything's stupid" guy?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.272
He went nuts, didn't he?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.690
He went sane.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.401
He wanted to have more meaning
in his life.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.486
Go fire up the hot rocks, Tammy.

07:24.570 --> 07:28.073
And speaking of which,
congratulations on your ring.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.743
It's real
and my days in this hellhole are numbered.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.829
-Go fire 'em up, Tammy. Move.
-People are waiting for bread.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.083
I gotta man the stupid goddamn bake shop.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.128
I gotta go get a costume change
out of my locker.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.174
Save me a spot in the cancan line.
My brother and sister are here.

07:47.676 --> 07:51.722
I like to yodel
I yodel all the time

07:51.805 --> 07:55.601
I like to yodel
It makes me feel so fine

07:55.684 --> 07:57.477
When I start to yodel…

07:59.646 --> 08:01.982
Oh, no.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.026
Here's how it goes

08:08.197 --> 08:10.616
We're supposed to meet someone at the bar.
Is that what she said?

08:10.699 --> 08:12.409
I think so. This place. It's--

08:12.492 --> 08:14.620
You must be Stewart and Dianne.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.413
-Yeah.
-Come on.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.249
This is the best table to watch the show.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.334
Thank you.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.920
You'll be able
to see her beautiful blue eyes from here.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.466
And just so you know, we all love Peggy.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.343
She is a treasure.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.429
Thanks. That's very nice.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.057
The daily special is the brisket.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.393
And we would like to offer
the 10% family discount to y'all.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.104
That's very sweet. Thank you.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.649
We don't normally offer the discount
for the daily special,

08:43.732 --> 08:46.193
but we sure do love Peggy.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.286
You know, I gave up meat,
but I might cheat and get the brisket.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.372
I gave up meat
when I walked in this place.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.623
Oh, yeah?

09:00.582 --> 09:02.459
Why, you son of a bitch!

09:03.168 --> 09:04.169
Hey!

09:05.295 --> 09:06.296
Hey. Come here!

09:07.297 --> 09:09.258
Son of a-- What the--

09:14.304 --> 09:15.430
Hey, cowfolk!

09:22.312 --> 09:23.146
Hi!

09:29.444 --> 09:30.445
Here you go.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.573
Why, I oughta…

09:39.121 --> 09:40.122
Hi!

09:43.125 --> 09:44.168
Take that for me!

09:50.048 --> 09:51.884
Dirty sidewinder!

09:55.220 --> 09:56.471
Threes.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.899
Wow. You still gonna get the brisket?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.247
There you go, my Peggy.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.541
-Thank you, Roger.
-I mean, wow.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.960
Here, let me get this for you.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.922
I don't like tomatoes neither.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.384
I love your earrings.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.262
I have almost the same ones,
but yours are real.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.601
So we're doing life together now,
huh, guys?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.271
Starting with Mommy's bench tomorrow.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.440
We'll bring it up to her favorite spot,

10:48.524 --> 10:51.527
and then she can just stare at that view
forever and ever.

10:51.610 --> 10:52.611
See, once again,

10:52.694 --> 10:55.489
you can't just plunk a bench
on federal land, Peg.

10:56.073 --> 10:59.159
I wish you brought the kids.
They have to come stay with me soon.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.911
We'll have so much fun.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.831
Yeah. They had so much fun when the DEA
raided your house and searched them.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.251
-Okay. Let's not.
-Yeah. That was years ago.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.294
They're not gonna stay with you
because they're traumatized--

11:09.378 --> 11:11.922
Hey, we'll see. Okay?
Let's see. Maybe we'll do it.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.967
-More ice tea? It's bottomless.
-I'm okay. Thank you.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.009
That's my brother.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.720
And this is my beautiful little sister.
We're sisters.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.890
-No, you're not. Are you?
-Yes.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.978
Must've been so much fun
growing up with Peggy.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.104
You have no idea.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.648
Did you call her Margaret growing up
or just Peggy?

11:30.357 --> 11:31.441
-Just Peggy.
-Yeah.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.485
-Peggy only.
-Or "Face-in-the-plate."

11:33.569 --> 11:34.736
Oh, dear.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.906
No. My face never fell in the plate.

11:39.908 --> 11:40.951
Okay.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.495
Peggy.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.706
What are your plans?

11:49.001 --> 11:50.002
What do you mean?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.338
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do next?

11:54.006 --> 11:56.425
-Regarding what?
-"Regarding what?"

11:56.508 --> 12:01.221
I mean, look, it's fine that we
supported you while Mommy was here

12:01.305 --> 12:05.475
because you were taking care of her,
but ain't happenin' anymore.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.394
-Peggy, you need a job.
-Uh-huh.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.980
Hey, I have a job. Look around you.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.064
Well…

12:11.148 --> 12:13.609
And don't disrespect me
'cause we pool tips.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.153
Well, you work as a fictional barmaid.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.948
Yeah. That's acting. That's my job.

12:20.032 --> 12:23.660
What if you act like
a court stenographer or something?

12:23.744 --> 12:24.870
What?

12:25.954 --> 12:28.790
I have a record. This is kind of
the best I can do right now.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.585
Okay.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.337
No, you can…

12:34.171 --> 12:36.423
-Oh, my God.
-You said you're speaking to her.

12:36.507 --> 12:40.135
-Dianne has something she wants to say.
-Okay. We met with a Realtor this morning.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.512
Oh, my God.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.971
You can't pay the mortgage.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.640
-What are you saying?
-We have to sell the house.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.683
-You can't sell Mommy's house.
-Peggy, please.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.394
Is that why you came back here?
You came back here to evict me?

12:49.478 --> 12:51.522
We can't just pay
for the house indefinitely. Come on.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.899
So you stop by just to toss me out
on the street?

12:53.982 --> 12:55.776
-No.
-Wait, nobody's going on the street.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.654
We just need to start getting practical,
you know?

12:58.737 --> 13:00.447
-Just-- Let's come up with a plan.
-Yeah.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.785
And they gave you the family discount.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.135
Your mother's not with you again today.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.345
No, not today.

13:26.181 --> 13:31.103
Tell her I tried the soup,
the Tabatchnick, frozen.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.188
She recommended the split pea.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.524
Yeah.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.776
It was very good. I was surprised.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.865
You know you can't do that in here, Peggy.

13:42.948 --> 13:46.285
It's not lit. I quit. I told you.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.830
Almost up to a week take home. Good job.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.541
Yeah. It would be nice
to come in just once a week.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.587
It's not you, it's the lighting.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.176
Who are you fooling?

14:03.093 --> 14:05.888
-What?
-You're not here for pain management.

14:07.598 --> 14:08.682
Yeah, I am.

14:09.183 --> 14:12.227
Methadone is ten times harder to quit
than heroin. You know that?

14:15.606 --> 14:17.107
Okeydoke. Here we go.

14:17.691 --> 14:18.775
You don't even know me.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.866
I do, actually.

14:27.326 --> 14:28.577
You're a junkie.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.413
You'll get a double addiction,
and you'll end up dead.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.459
Give your mother my regards.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.668
She died.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.629
Three weeks ago.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.549
Try the potato soup.
That was her favorite.

15:12.788 --> 15:17.417
Hey. Are you okay?

15:22.673 --> 15:25.133
My mommy's gone.

15:29.805 --> 15:30.931
Oh, damn.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.184
I'm so sorry to hear that, sister.

15:38.063 --> 15:41.567
You wanna cop? I got some oxys.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.611
No!

15:45.279 --> 15:46.613
Fuck. You do that here?

15:47.281 --> 15:49.032
No, I don't wanna cop.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.035
I'm on methadone. Shame on you.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.787
Fucking creep.

15:55.038 --> 15:59.459
Hey, just-- Just give me your number,
just in case.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.504
No! Fuck. Don't.

16:02.588 --> 16:03.797
Fuck you.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.203
-Hey, Carol.
-Hey, Peggy.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.287
Hey, Peggy.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.665
-Peggy. No, Peggy.
-Hear this?

16:38.749 --> 16:42.461
-I don't have time for that. Can you--
-I know Wagner was a Nazi, but…

16:42.544 --> 16:46.465
-It's happening.
-…he created sounds from spiritual realms,

16:46.548 --> 16:48.300
-and that's where Mommy is now.
-It's happening.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.594
Peggy, a federal agent is following me.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.138
-He's gonna arrest me. Listen to me.
-Hey.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.432
Who's a federal agent?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.519
-Slow down.
-A yellow hat…

16:59.019 --> 17:00.020
Where are you?

17:01.772 --> 17:02.898
A yellow hat?

17:19.289 --> 17:22.709
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
New medication.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.549
Carol.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.260
Carol, it's me. Open up.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.681
Hey. Are you okay?

17:39.518 --> 17:42.062
Did you see him?
The guy with the yellow cap?

17:42.145 --> 17:43.522
Yeah. No, he's not a fed.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.148
Look, he's a plumber.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.821
Eats vegan yogurt.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.407
Lucky day. Next one's free.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.450
I was sure he was following me.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.786
It happens.

17:57.870 --> 18:00.956
Life as a fugitive. It's not always fun.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.166
Come on. You're buying.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.380
Wait, they're throwing you out
of the house?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.465
That's why they came to the show?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.468
How are you even related to those two?

18:13.552 --> 18:15.637
I mean, can they let you mourn for,
like, ten minutes?

18:15.721 --> 18:18.891
No. No mourning, no grieving,
just, "Go work at Kinko's right now."

18:18.974 --> 18:21.268
They just care
about their fucking mortgage.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.604
We knew
they weren't gonna support you forever,

18:23.687 --> 18:26.023
so now you're just gonna have to hustle.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.774
I need a hustle.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.568
No. "To" hustle.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.741
What does she want,
a ride to the liquor store?

18:39.661 --> 18:40.495
Butt-dial.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.791
-And she's just a kid.
-Yeah, a kid who sneaks out the window.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.420
She steals your wine. She steals your car.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.755
She's just pissed.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.049
Okay, so her mother left her. Big deal.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.218
Her father's better off with you.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.886
She should be kissing your ass.

18:55.969 --> 18:59.473
Come on, Peg. Didn't Ethan ever act out
'cause you weren't around?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.100
-I didn't leave my son. Okay?
-I--

19:02.184 --> 19:04.269
-I fought for custody.
-I know.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.271
I know. That's not what I'm saying.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.899
-That just came out wrong.
-It's very fucking different.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.318
I know. Okay? I'm sorry.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.945
…in the High Desert?

19:13.028 --> 19:15.489
-I got my PI license…
-Hey. You-- Turn this up.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.740
…from Mustang College.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.452
All the dramatic events
that make for great TV…

19:20.536 --> 19:23.539
That's the fucking PI
that ripped Jeannie off.

19:23.622 --> 19:29.962
With Mustang College, you could have
a career like criminology, anti-terrorism…

19:30.045 --> 19:32.464
I hate those fuckers. I can do that.

19:32.548 --> 19:34.716
Train to do background checks.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.468
I do that shit in my sleep.

19:36.552 --> 19:39.096
This guy. Talk about a hustle.

19:39.179 --> 19:44.685
Train to be like me,
Bruce Harvey, Private Investigator.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.072
Yes.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.993
Well… Okay.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.162
eBay ruled, your case is closed.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.665
So, read your buyer's contract.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.170
All right, look.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.552
I just got in a brand-new CPAP machine.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.846
It's only been used twice.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.598
Yeah. Mint condition.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.057
I haven't even listed it yet.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.562
I can give it to you for seven.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.648
680?

20:31.732 --> 20:33.734
250?

20:34.776 --> 20:36.278
Okay, how about…

20:37.029 --> 20:38.113
fuck you!

20:41.742 --> 20:43.410
Temper, temper…

20:44.953 --> 20:46.205
What are you supposed to be?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.832
A real PI. What are you playing at?

20:49.499 --> 20:53.837
Is this one of those birthday stripteases?
Because I prefer the lady cop.

20:53.921 --> 20:56.423
You owe my friend Jeannie 300 bucks.

20:56.507 --> 20:58.133
I'll take cash.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.054
Yeah, well, you know what? I'm working
this case behind-the-scenes, princess.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.555
I'm not so sure.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.432
Look, I need Jeannie's 300.

21:05.516 --> 21:09.269
Or we could just take this
to Small Claims Court and Yelp.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.563
Fuck Yelp. I give it one star.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.527
Where you going?

21:22.032 --> 21:23.951
Are you even still a PI?

21:24.034 --> 21:25.452
It's like Big Lots in here.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.209
Please, make yourself at home.
What, do you live here now?

21:34.211 --> 21:36.421
I'll get your friend her money. Okay?

21:36.505 --> 21:40.592
Look. You've fallen on hard times.
I can see that. It happens.

21:40.676 --> 21:43.846
But if you take a woman's money,
you gotta deliver.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.187
How'd you know I like it so sweet?

21:52.271 --> 21:53.522
I looked in your garbage.

21:53.605 --> 21:56.817
Three empty cups and 15 sweeteners.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.318
I deduced, like a detective.

21:58.402 --> 22:01.613
You know, when this account is settled,
I might consider working with you.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.073
I'm not hiring.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.324
Yeah, 'cause you're broke.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.785
You got an office with holes in the walls

22:06.869 --> 22:09.454
and another
with an outdated eBay collection.

22:10.080 --> 22:14.168
I'm sensing conflict, abandonment
and financial insecurity,

22:14.251 --> 22:16.545
which has impacted your diet.

22:17.462 --> 22:20.549
Things are a little slow right now.
It's seasonal.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.926
Hey, what if I could bring business
in here?

22:23.010 --> 22:25.345
I could make it rain,
would you be hiring then?

22:25.429 --> 22:27.848
Sure. Okay?

22:27.931 --> 22:31.560
Okay. In the meantime,
I need Jeannie's bread.

22:32.102 --> 22:34.229
Cash or payment-in-kind.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.274
Take what you want.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.953
Can you believe it?

22:50.037 --> 22:53.332
It's not definite,
but it's looking really good.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.499
I mean, who would have thought?

22:54.583 --> 22:57.419
Me at my age,
starting this prestigious career?

22:57.503 --> 23:00.005
I'm like Mary Tyler Moore on methadone.

23:00.839 --> 23:05.135
-Yeah, I just don't see it as a--
-Stewie, hey.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.846
What are you doing over there? Shopping?

23:07.930 --> 23:09.848
Hey, come on. Have a seat with us.

23:11.350 --> 23:14.436
I mean, you have to have a license
to be a PI, don't you?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.773
Well, I'll be more like a PI's intern
when he hires me…

23:17.856 --> 23:19.650
-Yeah.
-…which he hasn't yet,

23:19.733 --> 23:22.110
but that's a big "yet"
'cause the guy fucking loves me.

23:22.194 --> 23:25.155
Yeah, that's a wish, Peg,
it's not a paycheck.

23:25.739 --> 23:26.698
Yeah, I'm sorry, Peggy.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.909
I know you're excited,
but this just sounds like

23:28.992 --> 23:31.703
another one of those crazy things
you're trying between rehabs.

23:31.787 --> 23:34.873
Yeah, what about a job-job?
You know, with some structure?

23:34.957 --> 23:38.669
You show that you're helping yourself
and then maybe we could help you.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.546
I am helping myself.

23:40.629 --> 23:44.633
Does anybody fucking care
that I'm down to two milligrams a day?

23:44.716 --> 23:48.512
I was up to 60.
Do you know how fucking hard that is?

23:48.595 --> 23:50.639
-It's really fucking hard!
-Peggy,

23:50.722 --> 23:52.891
-I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore.
-Hey.

23:52.975 --> 23:54.518
When I had money, we all had money.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.480
-From dealing drugs!
-Okay, judgy, it was a little pot!

23:58.564 --> 24:00.065
And maybe some hash.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.984
-It was harmless.
-There was cocaine.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.695
Well, that was much later.
And I did it, I didn't sell it.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.196
Wow!

24:06.280 --> 24:07.781
-Okay, calm down!
-Congratulations.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.119
Why don't I make us some espresso?

24:14.496 --> 24:15.706
Great.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.004
You want a bag for all my knickknacks?

24:22.671 --> 24:23.755
Don't answer her.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.465
Just don't.

24:25.549 --> 24:27.801
I mean, look at that thing.
That coffee machine is ridiculous.

24:27.885 --> 24:28.969
I don't even have one like that.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.888
You know, you could sell that thing

24:30.971 --> 24:33.265
-and pay for the mortgage next month!
-Oh, Stewie, come on!

24:33.348 --> 24:34.892
Mommy's gone!

24:36.059 --> 24:38.187
Is this what we're gonna be like now?

24:39.897 --> 24:41.982
It's how we are, Peggy.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.109
That hasn't changed.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.196
Ever since Denny,
your life's been a dumpster fire.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.541
Hello, sensei.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.335
Excuse me. Hello.

26:25.419 --> 26:27.921
But my ring is not moonstone, because…

26:28.547 --> 26:31.717
Two carats! Thank you very much.

26:32.384 --> 26:33.552
And there…

26:35.762 --> 26:37.639
is my sweet baby.

26:37.723 --> 26:41.852
He doesn't need to buy moonstones
because, as you can see,

26:43.353 --> 26:46.523
he's got leather couches and such.

26:46.607 --> 26:51.320
This whole place is like Club Med,
so I know you're jelly,

26:51.403 --> 26:54.865
but maybe you can find yourself
somebody too.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.368
Baby?

27:09.254 --> 27:11.882
What am I looking at?
I can't see under the cracks.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.634
Le Pigeon aux Petits Pois.

27:13.717 --> 27:15.093
It's a Picasso.

27:15.761 --> 27:18.222
"Le" what?
I don't think you're saying it right.

27:18.305 --> 27:20.307
I'm trying to bring you business.

27:20.390 --> 27:22.309
Come on. What's the problem?

27:22.392 --> 27:25.354
That fucking thing
has a million dollar reward.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.231
It's been missing for, like, ten years.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.484
Come on. It's probably a fake.
And that's not business.

27:30.984 --> 27:34.613
Your version of business is selling
Cabbage Patch dolls out of your basement.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.115
It's a temporary situation.

27:39.660 --> 27:43.705
Look. You need me and I need this job.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.336
-You have a record?
-No, of course not.

27:50.379 --> 27:53.340
But how far back would they go
to look for that kind of thing?

27:53.924 --> 27:55.884
No. Don't worry. I'm clean.

27:57.177 --> 28:00.180
All right. You know what?
I'm not equipped. I'm sorry.

28:03.308 --> 28:04.852
Who's this beauty?

28:04.935 --> 28:06.645
Fuck me.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.109
Hello! Mr. Geasley.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.653
I'm Peggy Newman, I work for Bruce Harvey.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.906
He's bringing hookers in the daytime now?

28:17.990 --> 28:22.286
And that just got you
a sexual harassment case in a civil court.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.747
I was recording that on my phone.
In my pants.

28:25.831 --> 28:27.666
Look I went over our books.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.626
We're a month,
maybe two, behind on the rent.

28:29.710 --> 28:30.711
Which, big deal.

28:30.794 --> 28:34.173
New bookkeeper.
Money in, money out. It's business.

28:34.256 --> 28:36.133
We'll get it to you as soon as possible.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.719
You'll get it to me today,
or I'll start eviction.

28:38.802 --> 28:40.971
Okay, I didn't wanna tip my hand,

28:41.054 --> 28:44.558
but the reason that Bruce is
so busy is all the hours he's putting in

28:44.641 --> 28:47.561
on this workman's comp case against you.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.022
Like, look at this!
Wobbly step, this is not to code.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.773
-I can't be held responsible--
-You're responsible.

28:51.857 --> 28:53.025
-Yes, you are responsible!
-But--

28:53.108 --> 28:54.610
-No buts. What buts?
-Come on now.

28:54.693 --> 28:57.112
He's walking with a cane now.
Why do you think I'm here?

28:57.196 --> 28:59.448
-Listen--
-No, you listen, shit stain.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.036
He's ashamed for anyone to see him.
It's his manhood.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.872
We're just deciding how much
to sue you for.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.459
And it all depends on what the doctors say
when they see the X-rays.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.795
So, we will be in touch.
You get my drift, fuckey?

29:15.047 --> 29:16.131
Don't call me that.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.720
Hey. Hello.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.890
"Frank, 204." That's me. I'm Frank.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.600
-Got it. Thank you.
-Okay. Have a good one.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.688
You're like the asshole whisperer.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.024
So, I work here now.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.442
You have any money to pay me?

29:35.526 --> 29:37.361
No, but you can intern.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.488
So, an unpaid associate.

29:40.489 --> 29:42.741
Look, I'm not looking
for ten bucks an hour.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.867
I want a percentage.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.452
Of what?

29:45.536 --> 29:48.080
You're mostly just helping
with the eBay business.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.374
God, no!
We're getting you back in the game,

29:50.958 --> 29:53.710
and you're gonna give me 50%
of all the business I bring in.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.629
-Are you out of your mind?
-Forty-five.

29:55.712 --> 29:58.841
-No!
-All right, 30. It's as low as I can go.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.301
Ten.

30:02.803 --> 30:05.389
-Fine.
-And you've got to get into PI class

30:05.472 --> 30:08.517
and work your way towards a license
if you wanna be a PI.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.644
Oh, come on. School's a racket.

30:10.727 --> 30:15.649
They spit you out financially illiterate,
and honestly, with no real sex education.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.234
I learned more at home.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.069
Go on. You look hungry, eat.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.409
Where'd you get this?

30:25.492 --> 30:27.536
Close by. And there's more
where that came from.

30:30.664 --> 30:32.499
Be here Monday morning at 9:00 a.m.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.376
I don't get up before 11:00.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.336
-9:00.
-Okay, fine.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.297
You win. 10:00.

30:40.132 --> 30:44.428
Hey! It's your big sister.

30:45.012 --> 30:47.681
Finally calling with some good news.

30:48.891 --> 30:50.309
I got the job.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.644
It actually happened.

30:53.687 --> 30:57.816
I wanna try to make up
for being so difficult.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.569
I mean, it's just us now.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.280
And we can all be close again.

31:05.449 --> 31:06.909
I love you guys.

31:09.036 --> 31:13.081
Hey. I don't know if you checked out yet,
but I'm at your hotel.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.375
I brought Mommy's bench.

31:16.043 --> 31:21.673
We can pick up Dianne and we can
bring it to Hawk's Peak and plant it.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.218
She loved it so much there.

31:25.928 --> 31:27.012
Oh, shit.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.620
Stewart. Leave a message.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.068
There.

32:25.696 --> 32:26.864
It's all right.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.032
You're all right.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.621
Margaret…

32:40.210 --> 32:41.670
Go.

32:41.753 --> 32:43.172
What is this, Christmas?

32:45.883 --> 32:47.467
Wow. Look at you.

32:48.218 --> 32:51.388
Hey, Peewee. This is my wife.

32:52.598 --> 32:53.932
What's with the shiner?

32:54.516 --> 32:56.435
It's nothing. It's all good.

32:56.518 --> 33:00.480
Peewee and I were friends, but no more.

33:05.152 --> 33:06.904
Let me get a look at you.

33:07.821 --> 33:11.575
You okay? I'm sorry I couldn't make it
to the funeral.

33:11.658 --> 33:13.452
I feel really bad about that.

33:13.994 --> 33:15.662
How you doing?

33:16.830 --> 33:17.915
I'm clean.

33:18.707 --> 33:20.125
What?

33:20.209 --> 33:23.378
-That's unbelievable. Are you kidding me?
-Yeah, I'm working a program.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.255
-That's incredible.
-Yeah. I know.

33:25.339 --> 33:27.716
Especially with everything
that you've been through, you know?

33:27.799 --> 33:28.884
Amazing.

33:30.344 --> 33:32.179
I'm trying so hard.

33:32.262 --> 33:34.848
I know. Me too.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.433
Oh, Denny, listen to me.

33:37.768 --> 33:42.940
Money in our landscape is a garbage dump.
And it's reflecting badly on me.

33:43.023 --> 33:45.192
You look fucking gorgeous, okay?

33:45.275 --> 33:46.860
So don't be too tough on yourself.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.739
You love me, right, Denny?

33:51.365 --> 33:53.075
Are you kidding me?

33:54.618 --> 33:56.453
I'm gonna be buried with this.

33:56.537 --> 34:01.041
If you really love me, you'll give me
the one thing that I really crave.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.461
Which is freedom.

34:05.671 --> 34:07.840
Which is a divorce.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.261
Is that what this is?

34:15.264 --> 34:16.723
We said we'd wait.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.058
No. You said that.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.893
I need to start over.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.438
I can no longer be encumbered by a felon,
which is you.

34:23.522 --> 34:27.317
Look, as the love of your life,
I have a vote in this.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.819
And my vote is no.

34:28.902 --> 34:31.487
-Request denied. I'm sorry.
-Okay. Your vote?

34:33.699 --> 34:38.286
Your sphere of influence--
It doesn't matter.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.206
You don't have that effect anymore.

34:41.290 --> 34:44.585
Not you, not Dianne, not Stewart.

34:45.502 --> 34:46.587
Not even gravity.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.466
I decided, I'm gonna fucking fly.

34:53.594 --> 34:54.969
Take off your glasses.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.473
Are you tripping right now?

34:58.557 --> 35:00.642
-Immaterial.
-It's not immaterial.

35:00.726 --> 35:03.437
You're trying to divorce me on acid.
You're not thinking straight.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.647
That's why I'm thinking straight.

35:05.731 --> 35:07.482
That's the whole fucking purpose.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.234
It's acid. It's not drugs.

35:10.068 --> 35:13.739
It's not like I came here
on fucking opioids.

35:14.406 --> 35:17.159
Look. Sign or don't sign,

35:17.242 --> 35:20.454
but in 30 days we're divorced.

35:20.537 --> 35:22.915
I asked you nicely, like a person.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.834
I drove all the way here on acid.

35:26.543 --> 35:29.463
You don't wanna be a person? Okay, good.

35:30.172 --> 35:31.673
Excuse me.

35:31.757 --> 35:32.925
Wanna make 20 bucks?

35:33.425 --> 35:34.676
-All right.
-Okay.

35:36.011 --> 35:37.346
Pass these to him.

35:40.265 --> 35:41.642
You've been served.

35:41.725 --> 35:42.726
I'll Venmo you.

35:51.902 --> 35:52.945
You got a pen?

35:56.698 --> 35:57.699
Jeannie.

35:58.534 --> 36:00.577
What's the problem? I'm on a schedule.

36:00.661 --> 36:02.120
Peggy. The safe was robbed.

36:02.204 --> 36:04.623
The cops are coming after you.
Owen said you did it.

36:04.706 --> 36:07.125
Why would I do that? I'm a PI.

36:07.209 --> 36:09.711
Because he's saying
you go in there for the Keurig.

36:10.587 --> 36:13.757
No. Nothing's gonna ruin this day.

36:14.258 --> 36:18.053
This isn't old Peggy Newman
where every day turns to shit.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.680
This is new-day Peggy.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.098
With signed divorce paper--

36:23.725 --> 36:24.935
Fucking fuck!

36:25.018 --> 36:26.270
What's the matter?

36:27.771 --> 36:29.857
You bastard!

36:30.691 --> 36:32.943
Okay. You tell the cops to stay put.

36:33.026 --> 36:34.820
I'm coming and I'm pissed.
