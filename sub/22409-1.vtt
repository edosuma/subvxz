01:01.937 --> 01:07.693
WE ARE NOT ALONE

02:38.992 --> 02:45.040
Legio mihi nomen est, quia multi sumus.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.044
Obey the power of God!

02:49.628 --> 02:51.838
-Ave Satanas!
-Leave this pure soul!

02:51.922 --> 02:53.340
Ave pater Satanas!

02:53.423 --> 02:56.551
I banish you, in the name of God!

02:57.386 --> 03:01.932
You shall live among the dammed!
And the dammed shall live with you.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.310
The Son of God keeps peace
among the faithful!

03:05.769 --> 03:07.562
For He is light and truth.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.525
Demon, return to your dark dwelling!

03:11.942 --> 03:14.569
Let the light of God
shine upon this woman!

03:15.654 --> 03:18.031
Leave her body
and take away her sins!

03:18.990 --> 03:21.785
The light of God shines
and strengthens my faith.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.371
I condemn you in His name!

03:25.455 --> 03:29.793
Your evil heart will be punished
and condemned to the gates of hell!

03:30.460 --> 03:36.091
Go to hell! To hell with you!
Go to hell!

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
To hell with you!

03:40.721 --> 03:43.765
-Father? What happened?
-You are free, my child.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.393
Thank you, Lord.

03:49.312 --> 03:54.317
It is done.
We have regained her soul.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.662
She was lucky the priest saved her.
They always solve everything, right?

04:06.455 --> 04:07.873
Only in movies.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.291
Can we watch another movie?

04:10.584 --> 04:14.129
No, Sofia. Monica is tired,
and we have a long day tomorrow.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.173
-She can go to sleep. Who cares?
-Sofia?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.926
I'm not tired.
She can go to sleep if she wants.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.553
Sofia, behave.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.972
Don't worry, I'll go take a nap,
and you...

04:24.055 --> 04:26.475
-See, Dad? We can...
-No! Go to your room.

04:30.854 --> 04:31.938
Take your suitcase!

06:03.446 --> 06:04.781
You OK?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.954
All right. Brush your teeth
and put on your jammies.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.956
You have to help us unpack tomorrow.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.001
I'll be back in ten.
You better be ready for bed.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.544
All right. Dad?

06:18.461 --> 06:22.257
I think there are mice in my room.
I just saw one.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.259
It could've been a rat. It was huge!

06:25.927 --> 06:27.012
What?

06:27.095 --> 06:29.764
There were mice in the other house, too,
but only in your room.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.411
Hello? Yes, we're here already.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.831
We're still moving in. What?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.294
Tomorrow?
We haven't finished unpacking.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.088
There are boxes all over the place.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.632
No, it's OK.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.634
I understand. So, tomorrow at eight.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.427
Sure.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.056
Did you hear that?

07:53.640 --> 07:54.891
Yes, of course.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.811
So, you're not going to be here
this weekend.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.063
No, I'll be here on Sunday. All day.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.998
-Ready?
-Yes.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.084
-Good night.
-Night, Daddy.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.590
Do you miss her?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.011
Me, too.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.605
Sofia, you need to start getting along
with Monica.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.275
She's part of the family now.
I really care about her.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.076
All right. Good night.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.956
Dad? This house freaks me out,
and I'm here all by myself.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.083
Can you stay here with me?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.003
Sofia, I know you.
Nothing freaks you out.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.339
-Besides, you're a big girl now.
-Please, Dad!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.675
Unless the rats attack you!

09:11.843 --> 09:13.386
There are so many, honey.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.764
There are rats all over!
They're everywhere!

09:19.642 --> 09:21.019
OK, good night.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.105
-Dad?
-No, sweetie. See you tomorrow.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.088
Are you there yet?

09:48.171 --> 09:49.339
MEANWHILE AT THE FARM...

10:00.517 --> 10:04.312
NATURALIS PHOTO EXHIBIT
BY MONICA FUENTES

10:10.652 --> 10:14.322
They're announcing the exhibit.
They don't know I haven't started yet.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.501
Aren't you going to miss all that?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.965
I told them it would be about nature.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.593
So, this place is perfect.
I haven't seen any houses around here.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.599
Thanks for being so patient with Sofia.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.435
Shit!

10:44.769 --> 10:45.812
PARTY ON FRIDAY!!!

10:56.197 --> 10:57.407
Smile.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.617
No, no. I don't want to.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.123
One more time.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.501
Make a pose. Come on!

11:12.839 --> 11:14.174
OK, that's enough.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.271
What if she hears us in the other room?

11:28.897 --> 11:31.274
I think she would poison my food.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.239
Thanks, sweetie.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.204
-Sofia, can I get you something?
-Dad, can I go to work with you?

13:50.621 --> 13:52.707
No. A production line
is no place for a child.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.334
What am I supposed to do here?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.336
Well, you can help unpack.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.046
I don't want to be here alone.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.051
-You won't be alone.
-I don't know why we came here.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.428
I don't know anyone. I'll get bored.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.305
There's plenty to do in the house.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.391
You won't have time to get bored.
Besides, you're on vacation, right?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.602
I didn't want to come here.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.986
It's sunny outside. I'm going out
to take some pictures. Want to join me?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.072
Really, Dad.
Can I go to work with you?

14:24.155 --> 14:27.575
No, Sofia. I'll be busy
and won't have time to take care of you.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.661
Why don't you help Monica
with her pictures?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.740
Sofia?

16:06.257 --> 16:08.050
Sofia, stop it! I'm not kidding!

16:15.975 --> 16:16.976
What?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.730
Sofia, you crossed the line. Stop it.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.982
I've been very patient,
but I won't stand for this.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.233
What? What did I do?

16:24.400 --> 16:25.526
-Go to your room.
-Why?

16:26.027 --> 16:28.821
You're grounded.
I'll talk to your father tonight.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.573
You're crazy, right?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.868
Please, go to your room.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.671
She's crazy, Dad. You're never here.
That's why she's...

16:45.755 --> 16:49.217
-You know what you've done.
-Dad, I didn't do anything.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.886
Monica could've hurt herself, Sofia.
I'm very mad at you.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.389
You always take her side.
You never believe anything I say.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.059
-And whose fault is that?
-No, Dad. You like her more.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.478
-Sofia, you know very well...
-It's true!

17:01.020 --> 17:02.438
It's not like that at all.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.273
She shouldn't ground me.
She's not my mother.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.861
I'm sorry,
but this time Monica was right.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.030
No allowance this week.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.156
So what? What can I buy around here?

18:10.381 --> 18:11.549
Mateo?

18:16.762 --> 18:19.599
I'm scared. I'm really scared, Dad!

18:20.766 --> 18:22.143
I'll check it out.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.978
-I'm coming with you.
-Wait here.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.480
It's OK, sweetie.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.365
No, Sofia, stay here, OK? Stay put.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.700
Wait for us here.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.688
I'll look outside.

19:52.942 --> 19:53.943
Hello?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.780
Is this the police?
I'm calling from 340 Los Robles.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.492
Yes. We heard some noises outside.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.619
Oh, I see.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.584
Yes, the Lazarte Estate? I don't know.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.838
-Can you send someone?
-Mateo, come here.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.844
OK, fine. Thank you. The only patrol car
they have is out of gas.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.387
Look at this.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.642
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

20:43.784 --> 20:46.203
It's a door, right?
Did they tell you about this?

20:46.454 --> 20:48.497
-No.
-Why would they seal a door?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.515
I'll get a flashlight.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.326
Look.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.666
Be careful.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.963
Did you know there was a basement?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.175
-Sofia, be careful.
-Dad!

22:28.806 --> 22:31.517
-Sofia!
-Do you have your shoes on?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.522
OK, enough.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.858
No, no! Just a little bit more, please!

22:39.900 --> 22:40.901
What happened?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.404
I didn't do it! The vase fell.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.614
If you didn't do it, who did?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.617
It doesn't matter.
It's just an old vase.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.996
Let's go.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.403
"I'm busy," he tells me.

23:26.404 --> 23:28.032
"I'm busy, Dad."

23:28.657 --> 23:32.119
If I said that to my old man,
he'd beat the crap out of me.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.412
Isn't that right?

23:36.414 --> 23:38.000
Can you talk to him?

23:39.043 --> 23:41.795
Yes, I can.
But I don't think it's a big deal.

23:42.171 --> 23:46.091
He doesn't do anything. He's always
on the phone with his friends.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.888
That girl, Wendolin...
He's chases her all day long.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.185
I never see him do anything,
but he's always busy.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.358
You know, I want him to study.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.613
He shouldn't stay in this town.
We're supposed to leave this place!

24:11.325 --> 24:12.701
Don't you agree?

24:15.496 --> 24:16.664
What are you doing here?

24:20.376 --> 24:21.585
Not much.

24:23.128 --> 24:27.716
It must have been
around three in the morning.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.011
Really? At the Lazarte Estate?

24:32.054 --> 24:34.472
They said they heard noises
and there was no one there.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.726
Oh, now they're in trouble.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.728
You believe in that stuff?

24:39.812 --> 24:43.399
No, but it's not the first time we heard
stories about the Lazarte Estate.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.276
Why?

24:46.860 --> 24:49.071
-You don't believe in these things?
-No, not at all.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.032
Where are you going, Rafael?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.771
Delete that.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.522
Are you leaving?

25:26.734 --> 25:27.860
Are you tired?

25:28.986 --> 25:31.321
I couldn't sleep. It's been two nights.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.575
You should take an afternoon nap.
Rest a bit.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.089
-What did you do today?
-Nothing.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.886
I can teach you to take some pictures,
if you want. It's fun.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.774
Hi, honey.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.652
Yeah, we're waiting on you for dinner.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.406
OK.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.203
Yes, don't be late. Bye.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.793
Your dad will be late.

27:31.275 --> 27:35.571
Good night, little ones. Rest well.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.948
-Good night, Dad!
-Good night, Dad!

31:32.224 --> 31:34.476
Don't move. Don't move.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.234
Don't walk. Don't move.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.161
MOMMY

33:20.874 --> 33:22.000
Sofia?

33:26.838 --> 33:28.048
Sofia!

33:43.563 --> 33:46.358
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. I was in my room.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.904
Did you hear anything,
or see anything strange?

33:54.491 --> 33:55.784
Do you want to...?

34:19.599 --> 34:21.643
The lightbulbs burned out.
How long had they been there?

34:21.726 --> 34:25.438
I know they burn, but they don't
explode. Besides, that's not all.

34:25.813 --> 34:29.150
A secret basement,
strange drawings on the wall,

34:29.234 --> 34:31.444
-noises, things that fall on their own.
-Honey.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.530
Don't you dare tell me
it's my imagination.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.657
When was the last time you slept?

34:38.493 --> 34:41.955
I don't know. I tried to sleep
this afternoon, but I couldn't.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.081
Could that be what's upsetting you?

34:44.666 --> 34:48.670
I'm not saying you're imagining things.
But maybe you're more sensitive.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.599
-If you want to go back to Lima...
-No.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.517
I don't want to go back.

35:03.518 --> 35:07.439
You're right. Maybe I'm just tired.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.196
Let's go.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.637
Sofia?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.140
-What is it?
-There's someone in my room.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.393
There were feet under my bed,
the clown jumped, and...

37:08.476 --> 37:10.687
-Under your bed?
-Yes, Daddy. Down there.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.358
-Sofia, it was just a nightmare.
-No, Dad. I was awake, I swear.

37:15.442 --> 37:16.443
There's nothing here.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.404
-No, but...
-Sweetie, you always lie.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.699
-Mateo, she's really scared.
-You're not a baby anymore, come on.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.160
-But, Dad...
-You can sleep with us tonight.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.995
Yes, please. I don't want to stay here.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.747
No. No way.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.249
-No! Daddy, I can sleep with you guys...
-No, Sofia! No!

37:31.332 --> 37:34.961
-Mateo!
-No! She must learn to behave!

38:34.896 --> 38:37.023
-Good morning.
-Hi.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.443
-Did you get some sleep?
-No.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.073
What now? Are you mad at me, too?

38:45.615 --> 38:48.701
-Sofia was really scared last night.
-She was just pretending.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.955
Not this time. And you didn't
have to yell at her like that.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.380
-Wait. Look at your shoulder.
-What is it?

39:00.505 --> 39:02.924
What happened? Did you hurt yourself?

39:03.633 --> 39:05.927
No. I don't think so.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.180
That's weird.

41:10.426 --> 41:15.390
Help! Get me out of here! Help!

41:17.892 --> 41:23.272
Get me out of here! Help!

41:27.610 --> 41:31.197
Hey. Where's Sofia?

41:32.281 --> 41:33.533
She's in the house.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.828
Go talk to her. And don't get upset.

41:41.958 --> 41:42.959
Sofia?

41:53.886 --> 41:55.304
Oh, no.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.892
My daughter's missing.
What will I do?

42:02.395 --> 42:04.605
It'll be impossible to find
my little girl.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.150
Where could she be?

42:13.448 --> 42:14.741
What is it, Sofia?

42:14.907 --> 42:16.743
Dad, I really don't like this house.

42:16.826 --> 42:19.328
I think it's haunted
and there are ghosts.

42:19.412 --> 42:21.831
And there's a boy who is always
following me.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.833
Come here, honey. Come on.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.047
There's no such thing as haunted houses.

42:29.130 --> 42:32.467
-There are no ghosts.
-Dad, I saw some. I swear.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.388
Could we call a priest?

42:38.723 --> 42:39.891
Honey.

42:40.433 --> 42:43.561
Please, Daddy. Please.

44:11.274 --> 44:12.692
Do you feel better?

44:18.281 --> 44:19.282
Hey.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.327
Hi.

44:23.411 --> 44:24.662
We made some sandwiches.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.040
How are the pictures?

44:28.958 --> 44:30.126
So-so.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.721
Sofia and I were talking.

44:42.597 --> 44:47.018
Now she knows that there are no ghosts
and the house is not haunted, right?

44:51.439 --> 44:53.232
This has gone bad.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.528
-Can't you taste it?
-No, I just bought it.

44:59.947 --> 45:01.949
It's OK. I'm not hungry.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.620
Monica, I'm starting to worry about you.

45:06.703 --> 45:08.831
You haven't eaten or slept in days.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.627
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

45:14.754 --> 45:16.756
I slept for a couple of hours
last night, but...

45:17.673 --> 45:19.675
Maybe she's pregnant.

45:49.956 --> 45:51.249
Monica.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.335
Hey, Monica.

45:54.627 --> 45:59.173
Honey. Hey, Monica?

46:02.134 --> 46:06.472
Monica! Monica! No!

46:14.689 --> 46:16.983
-Are you OK?
-What happened?

46:18.567 --> 46:20.820
-You had a nightmare.
-What...?

46:21.821 --> 46:23.447
Mateo, something's happening to me.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.701
There's something wrong
with this house. Sofia's right.

46:26.783 --> 46:29.954
-Monica?
-I know you just started your new job...

46:30.037 --> 46:33.082
No, that doesn't matter. Listen.

46:33.541 --> 46:37.003
I'll find a way to break the rent,
and we can move to another house.

46:38.337 --> 46:42.133
I have meetings all day tomorrow,
but on Tuesday and Wednesday...

46:42.216 --> 46:46.512
-I can't do it right away, but...
-No, it's fine. I understand.

46:47.930 --> 46:51.726
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
-Don't worry.

46:55.604 --> 46:56.897
Let's find another house.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.581
Sofia!

47:57.291 --> 47:58.584
Sofia!

47:59.835 --> 48:00.920
Sofia, what is it?

48:01.128 --> 48:03.756
Help! Please get me out of here!

48:04.090 --> 48:05.549
Sofia?

48:05.841 --> 48:07.927
What's wrong? Sofia!

48:11.764 --> 48:16.936
Please, Daddy! Get me out of here!
Get me out! Please!

48:19.313 --> 48:20.731
Sofia.

48:21.190 --> 48:22.733
Are you OK?

48:22.899 --> 48:25.403
-Yes.
-Calm down, all right?

48:25.736 --> 48:29.490
Call Daddy. Tell him to come home.
Tell him I'm not lying, Monica.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.034
I'll tell him. Of course I'll tell him.

48:32.493 --> 48:35.538
I'm not lying, Monica. I'm not lying!

48:35.621 --> 48:37.581
I know, sweetie. I know.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.506
Could we please call a priest?

48:54.432 --> 48:55.641
Hey!

48:57.852 --> 48:59.478
What happened? Are you OK?

49:02.106 --> 49:03.107
Mateo.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.194
I'm Father Rafael.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.159
-Monica and your daughter called me.
-Dad?

49:13.826 --> 49:16.203
-Are you OK, honey?
-I was really scared.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.664
They called the town chapel,
and I came to bless the house.

49:19.206 --> 49:21.542
-Thank you, Father.
-No worries.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.172
Well, your dad's home. I can go now.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.134
Don't forget what we talked about.
Monica.

49:32.511 --> 49:33.929
Can we talk, Mateo?

49:39.852 --> 49:41.187
I'll be right back.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.707
I guess you want a donation
for your church, right?

50:02.666 --> 50:05.127
Mateo, the Lazarte Estate
is not a good place to live.

50:06.045 --> 50:08.004
Lazarte Estate?
What are you talking about?

50:08.088 --> 50:10.424
You must leave this house right away.

50:11.007 --> 50:13.093
I didn't want to scare your daughter
or fiancée, but...

50:13.177 --> 50:15.471
-I must get back to my family.
-Mateo!

50:15.596 --> 50:18.766
Don't come back here. Good night.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.434
Mateo!

50:25.356 --> 50:26.690
Take this.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.945
Come on, what's the harm?

50:32.571 --> 50:35.157
-Take it.
-Anything else?

50:36.700 --> 50:39.745
Don't put your family at risk.
Don't do it.

50:51.882 --> 50:53.634
-Tell me what happened.
-Dad, it was so scary.

50:53.717 --> 50:56.428
I was pulled inside my closet,
and then it locked itself.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.806
I know. Monica told me over the phone.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.808
-Dad?
-I need to talk to you.

51:00.933 --> 51:03.435
Monica knows what happened.
Right? Tell him.

51:04.562 --> 51:07.982
Remember what I said?
It's a conversation for grown-ups.

51:08.399 --> 51:09.650
Wait for us in your room.

51:09.733 --> 51:12.403
No, I don't want to be alone
in my room. I can watch TV.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.737
OK, fine.

51:16.407 --> 51:17.992
I need to show you something.

51:25.332 --> 51:28.586
I know Sofia has a wild imagination,
but did you have to call a priest?

51:28.669 --> 51:32.214
It's not her imagination. Something's
happening here, and it's not normal.

51:32.506 --> 51:33.799
I respect your beliefs,

51:33.882 --> 51:36.927
but I don't want my daughter
to believe in superstitions.

51:40.139 --> 51:41.890
It's not a superstition.

52:28.812 --> 52:32.566
In the name of
the powerful God Almighty,

52:32.650 --> 52:36.862
I command all filthy spirits,
all evil presences,

52:36.945 --> 52:39.490
to be damned in eternal hell!

52:39.573 --> 52:42.618
-Dad. Dad!
-Rafael! Run!

52:42.701 --> 52:44.370
-Dad, be careful!
-Run, son!

52:44.453 --> 52:47.039
-Save yourself, Rafael!
-Please, Dad!

52:47.498 --> 52:48.916
No!

52:49.291 --> 52:52.961
Save yourself!
Save yourself, Rafael! Son!

52:53.045 --> 52:54.296
Dad!

53:29.039 --> 53:30.416
LAZARTE ESTATE

53:33.877 --> 53:35.379
UNSOLVED MURDER

53:40.592 --> 53:44.054
MAN MURDERS SPOUSE AND SON

53:48.308 --> 53:49.643
Murder took place at 673 Los Robles.

53:49.727 --> 53:52.646
Then, the man attacked his son,
Gabriel Mella, and choked him to death.

53:55.607 --> 53:58.152
MYSTIC ARTEMIO ECHECOPAR
STAYS AT LAZARTE ESTATE

53:59.486 --> 54:01.447
MYSTIC ECHECOPAR FACES PRESENCES
AT "LAZARTE ESTATE"

54:01.530 --> 54:03.615
MYSTIC ECHECOPAR AND HIS SON RAFAEL

54:08.787 --> 54:11.457
MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF MYSTIC ECHECOPAR

54:12.541 --> 54:14.710
RAFAEL ARRIVED AT THE SCENE DISTRAUGHT
AS HIS FATHER'S CORPSE LEFT

54:50.286 --> 54:51.622
You looking for me?

55:12.643 --> 55:15.437
My kids are beautiful and well-behaved.
They deserve a prize.

55:17.773 --> 55:20.025
It's the best harvest we ever had here.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.237
I have the last bottle.

55:24.488 --> 55:27.533
If it were up to me,
I'd celebrate mass with Pisco.

55:28.242 --> 55:30.118
Why didn't you tell me
you'd been in my house before?

55:32.037 --> 55:33.497
You wouldn't have listened.

55:38.126 --> 55:42.798
Was your dad a shaman? A conjurer?

55:43.507 --> 55:45.634
A paranormal investigator.

55:46.802 --> 55:48.011
That's what they say.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.808
He would've wanted me to follow
in his footsteps, but...

55:53.349 --> 55:54.643
I chose a different boss.

55:58.689 --> 55:59.982
What happened?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.945
My old man went against forces
beyond his control.

56:12.244 --> 56:16.665
Give me that book.
You're too small to read it.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.418
It's full of monsters.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.796
You'll have nightmares.
Give it to me now.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.511
There are two ghosts.

56:32.264 --> 56:35.225
The boy, Gabriel, died
when he was still an innocent child.

56:40.063 --> 56:41.315
And Victoria...

56:44.151 --> 56:45.569
is pure vengeance.

56:46.695 --> 56:47.905
Pure hate.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.533
She's very dangerous, Mateo.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.117
Monica!

57:43.961 --> 57:46.880
Monica? Monica!

58:16.034 --> 58:17.536
Monica!

58:36.680 --> 58:38.098
How did your father defeat them?

58:39.808 --> 58:41.184
He didn't.

58:44.604 --> 58:46.314
He only contained them.

58:56.074 --> 58:57.951
-Hello?
-Dad?

58:58.285 --> 58:59.286
Sofia?

58:59.369 --> 59:02.706
Something's wrong with Monica.
I heard screams from the second floor!

59:03.123 --> 59:05.917
-Where are you?
-Behind the rug, remember?

59:06.835 --> 59:09.129
Stay there. Don't move.
I'm on my way.

59:09.212 --> 59:11.506
Please hurry, Dad. I'm scared.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.718
Something's wrong. We have to go.

59:53.507 --> 59:55.217
Mateo, I'm not an exorcist.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.261
My father was, but I'm not.

01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.390
I can only help you get out of there.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.521
When we get there,
you must to do what I say.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.193
There's no time for second guessing.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.072
You must trust me. Have faith.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.160
All right?

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.546
Sofia!

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.674
-Sofia!
-Mateo! Mateo!

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.478
Dad!

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:52.566
Sweetie! Are you OK?
Did they hurt you?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.484
No?

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:02.969
I'm an instrument used to vanquish evil.
Give me Your power and strength.

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.680
By the power of God,
I command you to leave her body.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:07.766
By the power of God
and the Holy Spirit.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:13.396
By the power of the Holy Church,
the Virgin Mary, all angels and saints,

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:14.689
give me strength.

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:18.068
Give me the humility in victory
to understand suffering in defeat.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.987
The devil's poison is powerful
and his means are seductive.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.948
Give me strength, Lord.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.826
Give me your power and light, Lord.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.330
Abuna di bishemaya,

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:35.210
itqaddash shemak, tete malkutak.

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.337
Abuna di bishemaya,

itqaddash shemak, tete malkutak.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.260
Abuna di bishemaya,

itqaddash shemak.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.334
Monica?

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.728
¡Abuna di bishemay, itqaddash shemak!

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.646
¡Tete maltukak!

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.025
¡Tit'abed re'utak!

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.737
In the name of God,
I command you to leave her body!

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.697
In the name of the Holy Church!

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:47.991
In the name of the Virgin Mary,

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:52.329
all angels and saints,
I command you to leave her body!

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.040
Go back to hell where you belong!

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.669
¡Abuna di bishemaya!
¡Abuna di bishemaya!

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.713
¡Tete malkutak!

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.593
Hold her. Hold her.
Sofia, the briefcase.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.013
The briefcase!

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:28.239
Pick her up! That's it!

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.297
Try talking to Monica.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.424
Maybe you still can.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.183
Monica. Monica, you have to fight.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.186
Honey, listen. You can do it.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.651
Mateo?

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.612
What happened?

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.157
-Yes, honey, it's me.
-No!

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.832
Your mother is rotting in hell!

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.250
Don't listen to her!

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.585
Now it's your daughter's turn.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.685
Honey, please help me.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.021
Come here. It hurts.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.524
-Help me.
-Mommy?

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.776
Help me, please. It hurts.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.572
No, Sofia, go.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:51.948
-Dad!
-Leave!

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.706
Sofia, stay there.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.960
I command you
to bow before the God Almighty

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:08.423
and obey the one and only Great Lord.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:10.133
Nacama nacama retro!

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.484
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.029
Dad! Dad!

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.907
Dad, what's happening?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.700
Dad!

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:40.205
Victoria! Victoria, what are you doing?
Let him go!

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.834
He's not Ricardo,
You'll never get your revenge!

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.590
Dad!

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.884
I exorcise you with the power
of the Divine Light.

01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:56.846
I command you to leave this body
in the name of God!

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.349
You remember Lucia?

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:03.311
She was pregnant with your child.
But she got rid of it.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.231
Who would want you as a father?

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.276
This is what you brought me?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.072
A drunk! A useless bastard!

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:16.324
I expel you in the name of God!

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:21.204
You like this?
Your father also wanted it.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.750
In the name of God, I expel you!

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:30.588
I remember the taste of his blood.
He died a coward.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.050
Don't talk about being a coward.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.636
Ricardo must be laughing at you
in his grave.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.305
He killed you,
and you will never get your revenge.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:42.892
You couldn't even save your own son!

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.519
You're nothing!

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:25.225
-Mateo?
-Are you OK?

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.184
No, Monica!

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:10.395
Dad! Dad!

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.232
-Dad! No, Dad!
-Leave!

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:16.361
Dad! Dad!

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:21.866
Dad! No! Dad, no!

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:29.957
Dad, no! Monica, no!
Dad?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:34.087
No, Monica! Dad! No!

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.432
-No!
-Sofia!

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:57.193
Monica! Monica! Monica!

because your adversary the devil

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.130
