little thing normally
and now...

33:17.997 --> 33:21.001
She doesn't spend time
with anyone except us
and her mum.

33:28.425 --> 33:29.509
Rob.

33:31.219 --> 33:33.513
-Rob, who are you calling?
-Her mum.

33:33.596 --> 33:36.808
Look, maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's just
her imagination.

33:36.891 --> 33:40.061
Hey, Suzanne, it's me.

33:40.145 --> 33:42.397
No, no, no,
she's fine. Just...

33:42.480 --> 33:45.275
Have you left her with
any of your boyfriends?

33:45.358 --> 33:47.027
I'll tell you what kind
of question it is.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.195
It's a question about
the safety of our daughter.

33:50.864 --> 33:54.576
(SCOFFS) I don't care
who they are.
You're not hearing me!

33:55.368 --> 33:56.619
Look...

33:56.703 --> 33:58.872
You know
what I'm talking about.

33:58.955 --> 34:01.916
Mum's boyfriends.
It's classic, isn't it?

34:03.335 --> 34:05.378
I'm not being
aggressive, Suzanne.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.797
Look, would you listen?
I'm not accusing you.

34:08.882 --> 34:10.425
I'm just trying to find out...

her mother, Sarah, a maid,

34:29.735 --> 34:32.530
they lived in
the staff quarters.

34:32.614 --> 34:35.617
Do you think this Alice
is haunting Molly's
little girl?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.369
-Is this all about them?
-No.

Henry Douglas.
Suffered delusions and
all-round lethal psychopath.

Murdered Alice in 1890
when she was six years old.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.252
She's buried
in the children's graveyard.

34:47.795 --> 34:49.130
Well, how many were there?

34:49.214 --> 34:51.257
A few, but only one in
the period you're looking for.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.177
I love confirming
what you already know!

37:14.150 --> 37:16.528
Hey, any chance I could
borrow a tenner?

37:16.611 --> 37:18.655
Yep. Here you go.

37:18.738 --> 37:21.032
Oh, it's just until Rob pays
the last of what he owes me.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.410
I want to get
a little cool thing for Ella.

37:24.703 --> 37:27.038
Nice. Don't work too hard.

37:27.122 --> 37:29.416
I don't even want to go
in today.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.835
