00:34.454 --> 00:36.589
Good evening.
I'm Helen Mirren,

00:36.591 --> 00:38.991
and you're watching
"Documentary Now!"

00:38.993 --> 00:41.293
season 51.

00:41.295 --> 00:44.530
His films are
the stuff of Hollywood legend,

00:44.532 --> 00:47.299
but until he consented
to this documentary,

00:47.301 --> 00:50.769
few knew the inner life
of Hollywood producer

00:50.771 --> 00:52.538
Jerry Wallach

00:52.540 --> 00:57.343
and the obsession that fueled
and plagued his career.

00:57.345 --> 01:00.846
Well, it's all laid bare
in the Hollywood exposé,

01:00.848 --> 01:05.384
"Mr. Runner Up:
My Life as an Oscar Bridesmaid."

01:08.255 --> 01:10.456
Everybody has
a great Jerry Wallach story.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.324
Everybody.
The only person in Hollywood

01:12.326 --> 01:13.926
who doesn't have
a great Jerry Wallach story

01:13.928 --> 01:15.494
is Jerry Wallach,

01:15.496 --> 01:17.363
because his are all lies.

01:17.365 --> 01:18.864
In fact, if you can keep
Jerry Wallach

01:18.866 --> 01:21.000
as far away from this
documentary as possible,

01:21.002 --> 01:24.370
you might actually have
something close to the truth.

01:50.764 --> 01:54.967
In 1939, Tootie Hayes was
nominated for best screenplay

01:54.969 --> 01:57.336
at the Academy Awards.

01:57.338 --> 01:59.071
Tootie did
what any nominee does:

01:59.073 --> 02:02.875
He bought the tux,
the most expensive shoes.

02:02.877 --> 02:05.511
He bought his wife
a Don Loper gown,

02:05.513 --> 02:08.413
and hired a limousine to boot.

02:08.416 --> 02:11.850
Great story short,
Tootie lost to the writer

02:11.852 --> 02:16.055
of a little film called
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."

02:16.057 --> 02:18.457
As Tootie and his wife left
the auditorium,

02:18.459 --> 02:20.659
a producer named Art Lange
said,

02:20.661 --> 02:24.630
"Cheer up, Tootie.
It's an honor just to be nominated."

02:24.632 --> 02:26.799
Tootie Hayes broke
his fucking windpipe,

02:26.801 --> 02:28.834
and when Tootie's wife tried
to stop the fight,

02:28.836 --> 02:31.870
he shoved her,
and she fell down some stairs.

02:31.872 --> 02:33.739
I love that story,

02:33.741 --> 02:36.675
because just as there's
only one bride at a wedding,

02:36.677 --> 02:38.344
there's only one winner

02:38.346 --> 02:41.046
who could bring home
Oscar gold.

02:41.048 --> 02:42.881
Every other nominee is
just a bridesmaid

02:42.883 --> 02:44.817
in a rented dress

02:44.819 --> 02:49.722
hoping someday
Oscar will propose.

02:55.762 --> 02:56.962
Tootie's wife was okay, though.

02:56.964 --> 02:58.364
Banged up, but, you know,

02:58.366 --> 02:59.565
she's all right.

03:05.639 --> 03:09.575
I grew up in Pollock Beach,
Brooklyn in the 1930s.

03:09.577 --> 03:12.478
Pop owned a store
that sold a jar of olives.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.014
Mom stirred a big pot
of laundry with a wooden spoon.

03:16.016 --> 03:18.917
I played stickball,
did pyro stuff.

03:18.919 --> 03:21.453
Everything was Norman Rockwell.

03:21.455 --> 03:24.690
But bad luck don't follow
statutory laws.

03:24.692 --> 03:27.793
It'll slam you hard
before you're 18.

03:29.897 --> 03:33.031
The Magenta Fever outbreak
hit kids in Brooklyn hard.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.933
What started with a cough
landed me

03:34.935 --> 03:37.002
near death in the hospital.

03:37.004 --> 03:41.840
I lived.
I was lucky, save for one thing:

03:41.842 --> 03:43.542
I went bald.

03:43.544 --> 03:47.546
You had to look close,
but I was a bald guy.

03:47.548 --> 03:49.181
I was five years old,

03:49.183 --> 03:51.817
and I was a bald guy.

03:51.819 --> 03:53.585
It sunk my self confidence

03:53.587 --> 03:56.955
all the way
to the mezzanine level.

03:56.957 --> 03:59.591
But my father didn't let me
sulk.

03:59.593 --> 04:01.593
No.
He took me to Broadway Bill Pearl,

04:01.595 --> 04:04.163
the finest hairpiece maker
in Manhattan,

04:04.165 --> 04:06.932
and he said, "Fix the kid."

04:06.934 --> 04:09.435
He taught me that any problem
can be solved,

04:09.437 --> 04:11.437
and solved convincingly.

04:13.206 --> 04:15.908
Pop died of a heart attack
a week later.

04:15.910 --> 04:17.776
He was 35.

04:17.778 --> 04:21.713
It was his time.

04:21.714 --> 04:23.582
As a bald kid with a dead dad,

04:23.584 --> 04:25.584
movies became my refuge.

04:25.586 --> 04:27.786
I'd sit back
in those cheap velvet seats

04:27.788 --> 04:31.023
and forget all about
my stupid little life.

04:31.025 --> 04:34.126
The projector rolled,
and suddenly I could be anyone:

04:34.128 --> 04:38.130
A swashbuckler banging swords
with Robin Hood,

04:38.132 --> 04:42.167
or maybe some Apache Indian
chasing after old John Wayne,

04:42.169 --> 04:45.904
or a beautiful young virgin
being seduced by Dracula.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.007
But I'll never forget the movie

04:49.009 --> 04:51.877
that captured my imagination
most of all.

04:53.847 --> 04:56.215
The theater went dark,
and the title appeared:

04:56.217 --> 04:58.484
Walt Disney's
"Snow White."

04:58.486 --> 05:02.688
♪ Everything is in tune
and it's spring... ♪

05:02.690 --> 05:05.157
The beautiful voice
of Adriana Caselotti

05:05.159 --> 05:07.860
filled the theater.

05:07.862 --> 05:11.697
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

05:11.699 --> 05:14.199
Every seat was filled:

05:14.201 --> 05:16.869
Main floor, loge, and balcony.

05:16.871 --> 05:19.771
At 25 cents a seat,
3,500 seats,

05:19.773 --> 05:23.909
we're talking $875
for one screening, minimum.

05:23.911 --> 05:25.777
And that's not counting
concessions.

05:25.779 --> 05:28.714
3,500 people spending
at least a nickel on popcorn...

05:28.716 --> 05:31.183
at least...
and you're looking at $1,000 gross.

05:31.185 --> 05:33.151
And that's for one showing.

05:33.153 --> 05:35.120
There were 15 showings a day.

05:35.122 --> 05:37.055
We're talking real money.

05:37.057 --> 05:38.757
And Caselotti was a no-name,

05:38.759 --> 05:40.626
so Walt probably paid her
scale.

05:43.129 --> 05:47.132
I knew from that day
that I wanted to make movies.

05:54.641 --> 05:56.241
I went to college,

05:56.243 --> 05:58.143
but I have absolutely
no stories from that time.

05:58.145 --> 06:00.212
But I'll never forget the day
I arrived in Hollywood.

06:16.729 --> 06:19.331
I saw a posting
for mail room jobs

06:19.333 --> 06:21.800
at the William Morris Agency.

06:21.802 --> 06:25.771
Only trouble was about 600 lugs
my age saw the same posting.

06:25.773 --> 06:28.874
I was on line for three hours.

06:28.876 --> 06:31.176
I almost gave up,
but then who did I see

06:31.178 --> 06:33.645
pulling up fast
in a '51 Cadillac?

06:33.647 --> 06:35.347
Mr. Burt Lancaster.

06:35.349 --> 06:37.115
Burt was a major star

06:37.117 --> 06:39.017
and a big client
for William Morris

06:39.019 --> 06:40.786
I had to do something.

06:40.788 --> 06:43.188
So I used what life gave me.

06:43.190 --> 06:45.023
I think quick.
I do the only thing I can think of

06:45.025 --> 06:47.225
is I take my hairpiece off
and I throw it under the car.

06:47.227 --> 06:48.627
You didn't.

06:48.629 --> 06:49.995
I did.
No, no.

06:49.997 --> 06:51.797
I took the toupee and I threw it
under his car,

06:51.799 --> 06:53.632
and I let the waterworks go,
you know?

06:53.634 --> 06:56.802
I said, "Y-y-you ran over
m-m-my dog, m-mister."

06:56.804 --> 06:58.604
Did you get the job?

06:58.606 --> 07:00.839
Will you let me finish
the fucking story?

07:02.842 --> 07:04.643
I got the job.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.214
I started the next day,

07:09.216 --> 07:12.651
my foot in the door
of lighty Los Angeles.

07:17.858 --> 07:21.093
It was time to hustle,
and hustle I did,

07:21.095 --> 07:23.996
rising and rising.

07:36.377 --> 07:38.844
I signed the biggest names
in Hollywood,

07:38.846 --> 07:41.013
and none of them read
their contracts.

07:41.015 --> 07:43.015
I got a commission
on their salaries,

07:43.017 --> 07:44.950
a producer fee on their films,

07:44.952 --> 07:47.786
plus a realtor fee
on all their homes.

07:47.788 --> 07:50.822
This practice was legal
for about six years.

07:50.824 --> 07:54.793
It was a golden era.

07:54.795 --> 07:58.163
By 1965, I was the top agent
at William Morris,

07:58.165 --> 08:01.099
and I lived in style
at my beautiful home,

08:01.101 --> 08:02.901
Villa Caselotti,

08:02.903 --> 08:04.936
named after the voice
of Snow White,

08:04.938 --> 08:06.338
who got paid scale.

08:06.340 --> 08:08.740
It was an Italian oasis
tucked away

08:08.742 --> 08:10.776
in the flats near LAX airport:

08:10.778 --> 08:13.145
Just me and the eucalyptus

08:13.147 --> 08:14.746
and constant planes.

08:34.301 --> 08:37.936
Then, one day, my life
changed with a phone call.

08:39.972 --> 08:42.974
It was Bob Goodwin,
president of Pinnacle Pictures.

08:42.976 --> 08:44.876
Wallach, it's Bob.

08:44.878 --> 08:47.179
I want you to know
I'm resigning.

08:47.181 --> 08:49.314
That's too bad, Bob,
but why call me?

08:49.316 --> 08:50.949
I don't work at your company,
and isn't that

08:50.951 --> 08:52.384
more of a Human Resources
thing?

08:52.386 --> 08:54.119
No.
You don't get it, Wallach.

08:54.121 --> 08:56.021
I want you to run the studio.

08:56.023 --> 08:58.824
The studio,
the studio, the studio...

09:00.427 --> 09:02.961
Run a movie studio?

09:02.963 --> 09:04.996
My dream since childhood.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.366
Sometimes,
when life runs at you,

09:08.368 --> 09:10.135
it's to throw you a bear hug.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.270
But sometimes it's to hit you
in the balls

09:12.272 --> 09:14.005
so hard your teeth click

09:14.007 --> 09:16.374
and you puke on your shoes.

09:16.376 --> 09:19.010
I took the job.

09:19.012 --> 09:21.246
I was now a major player,

09:21.248 --> 09:23.148
respected by everyone.

09:23.150 --> 09:25.250
"Jerry Wallach"
meant one thing:

09:25.252 --> 09:27.119
Success.

09:30.189 --> 09:33.859
I remember it was 1971,

09:33.861 --> 09:35.494
and we were in Beverly Hills,

09:35.496 --> 09:38.930
and it was Jack Warner's party
for Alfred Hitchcock,

09:38.932 --> 09:40.932
and the whole town turned out...

09:40.934 --> 09:43.969
all the name people
of the day.

09:43.971 --> 09:48.140
I went in the coatroom,
and Jerry was in there,

09:48.142 --> 09:49.908
and he was going
through the coats.

09:49.910 --> 09:52.377
Like, people's pockets.

09:55.214 --> 09:57.082
I never told anyone that.

10:19.338 --> 10:21.439
Pinnacle Pictures was
a small fry

10:21.441 --> 10:24.109
compared to the other
big hamburger studios.

10:24.111 --> 10:26.044
Pinnacle had hits in the '30s

10:26.046 --> 10:28.413
like the kids' series,
"The Scrapyard Gang."

10:33.954 --> 10:36.955
- Apples!
- Apples! Get your apples!

10:36.957 --> 10:38.824
- Apples!
- Apples! Get your apples!

10:38.826 --> 10:40.892
Hey, mister,
do you want to buy an apple?

10:40.894 --> 10:42.260
Certainly not.

10:42.262 --> 10:44.262
And if I see you
on this sidewalk again,

10:44.264 --> 10:46.498
I shall call the police.

10:47.868 --> 10:49.301
Now, see...

10:49.303 --> 10:50.569
My...

10:51.839 --> 10:53.371
Hey!
That's a real bat! Hey!

10:53.373 --> 10:55.941
But by 1964,
Pinnacle was near dead

10:55.943 --> 10:58.543
and starting to evacuate
its own bowels.

10:58.545 --> 11:01.880
And when I say stuff like that,
I'm speaking figuratively.

11:01.882 --> 11:04.182
From 1955 to 1964,

11:04.184 --> 11:06.218
Pinnacle only produced
educational films

11:06.220 --> 11:07.485
on drunk driving.

11:09.121 --> 11:11.990
When driving drunk,
always remember:

11:11.992 --> 11:15.293
One eye may see better
than both eyes.

11:15.295 --> 11:16.962
Keep one eye shut

11:16.964 --> 11:20.432
to drive drunk with gusto!

11:20.434 --> 11:23.401
I needed to get the studio's
finances back in the black.

11:23.403 --> 11:26.137
Only two things in business
are recession-proof:

11:26.139 --> 11:29.174
Comedy and
fantastic tennis shoes.

11:29.176 --> 11:31.643
Comedy was our ticket to hits.

11:31.645 --> 11:33.311
First, we needed stars:

11:33.313 --> 11:35.180
Lemmon, Martin, Lewis.

11:35.182 --> 11:36.448
Pinnacle couldn't afford them.

11:36.450 --> 11:37.983
Then it hit me:

11:37.985 --> 11:39.918
I was looking
for American stars

11:39.920 --> 11:42.020
when the biggest talent
I'd ever seen

11:42.022 --> 11:44.122
was right across the ocean.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.267
Enzo Entolini,

11:55.269 --> 11:56.635
the Italian Chaplin,

11:56.637 --> 11:58.536
the biggest star in Italy,

11:58.538 --> 12:01.339
and the only true genius
I've ever known.

12:01.341 --> 12:03.341
The first time I saw his work,

12:03.343 --> 12:05.644
I knew that this goofball
had it.

12:05.646 --> 12:09.147
Enzo wasn't just a talent.
He was a survivor.

12:09.149 --> 12:11.616
His father died
when he was three.

12:11.618 --> 12:13.518
His mother suffered
from deep depression

12:13.520 --> 12:14.586
and heart trouble.

12:14.588 --> 12:16.388
The village doctor told Enzo

12:16.390 --> 12:18.990
he had to make his mother laugh
to lift her spirits,

12:18.992 --> 12:21.693
but not too hard,
or she could die.

12:21.695 --> 12:26.164
At an early age, Enzo learned
how to do B to B- level comedy:

12:26.166 --> 12:27.632
Just enough
to make his mother chuckle,

12:27.634 --> 12:29.234
but no more.

12:29.236 --> 12:31.503
Mediocre impressions
of Jimmy Cagney,

12:31.505 --> 12:33.238
a puppet thing where Enzo would
ask the puppet

12:33.240 --> 12:34.472
what day of the week it was,

12:34.474 --> 12:35.473
and it would tell him.

12:38.178 --> 12:41.513
He rode a razor's edge
of humor no one else could.

12:41.515 --> 12:43.648
From jealous husbands
and horny wives

12:43.650 --> 12:46.318
to eating cigarettes
and falling off ladders.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.353
He pioneered
a new film movement,

12:48.355 --> 12:51.256
Italian sexy neorealism.

13:02.335 --> 13:07.105
I had to have Enzo Entolini
under contract for Pinnacle.

13:07.107 --> 13:09.274
Fortunately for me,
Enzo was free,

13:09.276 --> 13:11.743
living in London after landing
in hot water in Italy

13:11.745 --> 13:14.312
for comments his 12-year-old
wife made in the press

13:14.314 --> 13:16.314
about the church.

13:16.316 --> 13:18.316
I got on the next plane
to London.

13:23.190 --> 13:25.290
Enzo and me got along better

13:25.292 --> 13:27.192
than 7-Up and Seagram's.

13:31.531 --> 13:34.265
No one ever made me laugh
harder.

13:34.267 --> 13:37.402
From that first night onward,
a friendship was formed.

13:37.404 --> 13:39.304
I called him El Guapo,

13:39.306 --> 13:41.072
and he called me racist.

13:46.446 --> 13:50.315
I teamed Enzo up with radio
and TV star Ed Brulay.

13:50.317 --> 13:52.550
Brulay was an alcoholic
and a closet case

13:52.552 --> 13:54.719
living dangerously
on the edge of discovery,

13:54.721 --> 13:59.024
but their on-screen chemistry
was only a little deniable.

14:06.033 --> 14:09.134
Enzo and Brulay made three
of the biggest comedies

14:09.136 --> 14:11.536
of 1964 and 1965.

14:15.142 --> 14:17.042
In that same year, I decided

14:17.044 --> 14:20.045
to take one of the biggest
gambles of my young career.

14:31.658 --> 14:33.825
An epic could make or break
a studio.

14:33.827 --> 14:36.561
Bible pictures were big.

14:36.563 --> 14:39.064
The Bible is
the original comic book:

14:39.066 --> 14:42.233
Fake stories to please rabid,
violent fans.

14:42.235 --> 14:44.102
And if you get it wrong,

14:44.104 --> 14:47.605
they'll kill you
at one of their conventions.

14:47.607 --> 14:50.408
In 1959, Jack Warner had
bought the rights

14:50.410 --> 14:51.743
to the entire Bible.

14:51.745 --> 14:53.578
It was a big-dick move

14:53.580 --> 14:57.082
from the thickest python
in Hollywood's pants.

14:57.084 --> 14:58.283
What he didn't own
were the rights

14:58.285 --> 14:59.684
to the other fringe gospels,

14:59.686 --> 15:01.753
rejected
by the Council of Nicea

15:01.755 --> 15:04.222
in 325 AD.

15:04.224 --> 15:07.225
The Gospel of Thomas,
The Gospel of Simon...

15:07.227 --> 15:09.260
all stories of Jesus's life

15:09.262 --> 15:10.662
that were considered
blasphemous,

15:10.664 --> 15:12.497
and therefore up for grabs.

15:12.499 --> 15:14.432
I called the lawyer
who controlled the rights

15:14.434 --> 15:15.667
to The Gospel of Lewis

15:15.669 --> 15:18.136
and cut a deal.

15:20.774 --> 15:22.740
It told the story
of Jesus of Nazareth,

15:22.742 --> 15:24.542
and his friend from growing up,
Lewis.

15:24.544 --> 15:26.644
When Jesus starts hanging out
with the apostles,

15:26.646 --> 15:28.446
it's difficult for Lewis,

15:28.448 --> 15:30.849
because the friend groups
don't really mesh.

15:30.851 --> 15:33.418
Lon Barr
and Preston Fontaine star.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.221
So, Jesus, there's something
I've been meaning

15:36.223 --> 15:37.522
to talk to you about.

15:37.524 --> 15:39.891
Now, don't get me wrong.

15:39.893 --> 15:42.160
I'm having a great time.

15:42.162 --> 15:44.762
But the apostles...

15:44.764 --> 15:47.398
they worship you
as the son of God,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.567
yet scorn me.

15:49.569 --> 15:52.770
Lewis, my friend
from growing up,

15:52.772 --> 15:55.306
look not what they say or do.

15:55.308 --> 15:56.741
Those men like you.

15:56.743 --> 16:00.311
They said so.
They said...

16:00.313 --> 16:02.914
"We like Lewis."

16:02.916 --> 16:05.350
We treated the material
with the utmost respect.

16:05.352 --> 16:07.785
It was a story
of the son of God

16:07.787 --> 16:09.854
and a friendship caper.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.226
Lads?
Lads.

16:15.228 --> 16:17.328
You know what's great
about all of us?

16:17.330 --> 16:18.830
We're all from Jerusalem,

16:18.832 --> 16:20.632
and we're all good friends.

16:23.637 --> 16:26.671
Then choose, Nazarene!

16:26.673 --> 16:29.340
Choose out of all of us:

16:29.342 --> 16:31.676
Who's your best friend?

16:38.717 --> 16:40.451
Anyway, anyway,

16:40.453 --> 16:41.619
like I was telling you before,

16:41.621 --> 16:43.855
I had these two big baskets,
right?

16:46.926 --> 16:48.960
It had a score
by Miklós Rózsa,

16:48.962 --> 16:51.296
and a cast
of over 10,000 extras

16:51.298 --> 16:54.532
for an outdoor market scene
that we ended up cutting.

16:54.534 --> 16:56.834
It was the biggest budget
in Pinnacle's history,

16:56.836 --> 16:58.937
and it paid off.

17:00.839 --> 17:03.308
"Friend of the Son of Man"
was one of the last

17:03.310 --> 17:05.310
great road-show pictures,

17:05.311 --> 17:08.713
playing across the country
for over two years.

17:11.483 --> 17:13.451
But the critics savaged us.

17:18.290 --> 17:20.425
Pauline Kael
and Renata Adler,

17:20.426 --> 17:23.261
AKA Spinster and No Thanks,

17:23.262 --> 17:26.330
not only ripped apart the film,
but singled me out

17:26.333 --> 17:28.633
and printed my address.

17:28.635 --> 17:30.368
After all this work,

17:30.370 --> 17:33.271
I was still a joke
in Hollywood.

17:33.273 --> 17:35.573
Pinnacle was flush with cash,

17:35.575 --> 17:38.576
but we were strapped
for respect.

17:38.578 --> 17:40.878
I knew one thing could
put us on top,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.648
and that was
Mr. Gold himself.

17:43.650 --> 17:46.784
The Oscar.
The Academy Award.

17:50.556 --> 17:51.956
I made a bet with Jerry

17:51.958 --> 17:54.525
that "Friend of the Son of Man"

17:54.527 --> 17:56.461
would not recoup.

17:56.463 --> 17:58.863
If I won the bet,
he had to spend one night

17:58.865 --> 18:01.966
in the haunted mausoleum
of Lupe Vélez.

18:01.968 --> 18:05.270
If he won, I had to wear
a bandana around my neck

18:05.272 --> 18:08.006
every day for 50 years.

18:08.008 --> 18:10.008
And here we are.

18:11.543 --> 18:13.044
Prior to 1945,

18:13.046 --> 18:15.446
the Academy Awards had been
a small affair,

18:15.448 --> 18:17.615
a chicken dinner
at a hotel banquet room

18:17.617 --> 18:20.051
that we shared with some
L. Ron Hubbard thing.

18:20.053 --> 18:22.654
It ran only 45 minutes.

18:22.656 --> 18:24.722
But over the years,
the Oscars had grown

18:24.724 --> 18:27.425
into an event
like the great Roman games

18:27.427 --> 18:29.927
where gladiators
beat the shit out of each other

18:29.929 --> 18:31.629
for money or whatever.

18:46.845 --> 18:48.880
Pinnacle needed
an Oscar-winning film,

18:48.882 --> 18:51.582
and I would do everything
in my power to make it happen.

18:51.584 --> 18:52.884
You've heard of

18:52.886 --> 18:54.919
Captain Moby Dick
and Mr. Whale...

18:54.921 --> 18:57.655
well, my whale was a 13.5-inch,

18:57.657 --> 19:00.692
8.5-pound golden Adonis,

19:00.694 --> 19:02.627
and I'd spend
the rest of my life

19:02.629 --> 19:05.763
trying to lure that
son of a bitch into my net.

19:16.843 --> 19:19.577
And it was enormously hard
to be married to such a person

19:19.579 --> 19:21.646
when all he wanted was...

19:24.783 --> 19:26.384
Yes.

19:26.386 --> 19:30.488
We were married
from 1965 to 1967.

19:30.490 --> 19:32.690
Did he not mention that?

19:32.692 --> 19:35.660
I... I can't with him!
I just can't.
