00:53.887 --> 00:56.447
The film which you are
about to see

00:56.489 --> 00:58.457
is an account
of the tragedy

00:58.491 --> 01:01.426
which befell a group
of 5 youths.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.522
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young,

01:05.565 --> 01:07.897
but had they lived
very, very long lives,

01:07.934 --> 01:09.993
they could not
have expected,

01:10.036 --> 01:11.833
nor would they
have wished to see

01:11.871 --> 01:15.967
as much of the mad and macabre
as they were to see that day.

01:16.009 --> 01:20.241
For them, an idyllic summer
afternoon became a nightmare.

01:20.313 --> 01:24.545
For 30 years,
the files collected dust

01:24.617 --> 01:26.209
in the cold-cases
division

01:26.252 --> 01:28.720
of the travis county
police department.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.220
Over 1,300 pieces
of evidence

01:34.260 --> 01:36.353
were collected
from the crime scene

01:36.396 --> 01:38.364
at the hewitt residence.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.332
Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling

01:49.375 --> 01:51.400
than the classified
police footage

01:51.444 --> 01:54.347
of the crime-scene
walk-through.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.406
Test, test, test.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.907
Ok, uh... this
is august 20, 1973.

01:59.986 --> 02:02.819
The time is 3:47 p.m.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.292
Our location is the hewitt
residence on route 17.

02:06.359 --> 02:09.328
That's where
victim one was found.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.830
We're gonna do
a walk-through,

02:11.865 --> 02:14.333
and we're now
descending the stairs

02:14.367 --> 02:16.335
into the furnace room.

02:16.369 --> 02:17.836
Uh...

02:17.871 --> 02:19.338
there's... over here.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.840
There's scratch marks
along the wall.

02:21.875 --> 02:25.333
There's some more over here,
right along here.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.380
And... oh, there's something
over here. It seems like...

02:28.414 --> 02:33.852
it looks like a clot of hair
and an embedded fingernail.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.856
All right, we're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.892
The events of that day

02:39.926 --> 02:42.895
were to lead to one
of the most bizarre crimes

02:42.929 --> 02:44.897
in the annals
of american history...

02:44.931 --> 02:46.592
the texas
chainsaw massacre.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.902
Hold on! Hold on!

02:50.937 --> 02:52.905
Don't let go!
Not yet! Not yet!

02:52.939 --> 02:54.930
Yeah! Now! Now!
Let go!

03:13.760 --> 03:17.196
Big wheels keep on turning

03:17.230 --> 03:19.061
would somebody please
make her stop singing?

03:19.098 --> 03:21.362
Carry me home to see my kin

03:23.436 --> 03:24.903
i think you got
a beautiful voice, baby.

03:24.938 --> 03:25.962
Thank you.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.905
Ha!

03:27.941 --> 03:30.876
I miss alabamy once again

03:30.910 --> 03:34.311
and i think
it's a sin, yes

03:36.916 --> 03:38.508
can you believe...

03:38.585 --> 03:40.815
we didn't even know
each other yesterday?

03:42.355 --> 03:45.882
I know.
It's just amazing.

03:45.925 --> 03:47.222
Mmm!

03:49.295 --> 03:50.592
You know what's
even more amazing?

03:50.630 --> 03:52.427
Hello?

03:52.465 --> 03:53.830
Hello?

03:53.866 --> 03:56.334
What are you, like at a pause
or half-time?

03:56.369 --> 03:59.634
Ok, the fact that
33,000 americans each day

03:59.672 --> 04:01.230
are infected with
a sexually-transmitted disease,

04:01.274 --> 04:04.835
and two-thirds of them
are just about your age.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.668
Ha ha!

04:09.449 --> 04:10.939
Hey, morgan.

04:11.017 --> 04:14.077
How are you the expert
on the dumbest shit?

04:14.153 --> 04:15.711
Sweet home alabama

04:17.123 --> 04:21.355
lord, i'm coming home to you

04:23.496 --> 04:25.327
what are the odds
of you guys

04:25.365 --> 04:26.832
passing through
el paso

04:26.866 --> 04:28.834
just as i started
to hitch?

04:28.868 --> 04:31.496
I mean, it's like...
synchronicity.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.366
It's like i.s.d.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.501
It's like this shit
does not just happen.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.975
Oh, baby, they got to
play "free bird."

04:45.051 --> 04:46.245
Oh, they have to.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.513
We paid a fortune
for these tickets.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.418
Yo, kemp, can you do something
about the a.c. Back here?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.581
I'm melting.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.186
No.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.558
But if you or pepper
get too hot,

04:55.595 --> 04:57.062
you could always
take your clothes off.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.656
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.600
You are such a perv.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.365
Don't listen
to him, pepper.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.930
Why not?
I think he's funny.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.410
She's only known you
for 19 hours.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.775
I've lived with him
for 3 years,

05:13.846 --> 05:15.279
and trust me,
he is not funny.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.820
Morgan, hey,
let me see that.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.384
Careful, man.

05:29.429 --> 05:30.418
Thank you.
I think

05:30.463 --> 05:31.452
i can manage,
college boy.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.828
Here.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.333
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm nauseous.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.336
Montezuma's revenge.
I was like erin...

05:37.370 --> 05:39.770
"don't drink the water
down there."

05:39.806 --> 05:40.773
I didn't.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.331
And she didn't
drink the tequila,

05:42.375 --> 05:43.842
she didn't drink
the weed...

05:43.910 --> 05:45.605
smoke the weed.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.879
Well, maybe i
didn't go to mexico

05:48.915 --> 05:51.213
to watch you get
shit-faced for 4 days.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.309
That is what people do
when they go to mexico.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.853
What did you expect?

05:54.921 --> 05:56.889
I don't know.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.324
A tear-cut diamond ring
that goes right here

06:00.360 --> 06:02.225
on my beautiful
little finger?

06:02.261 --> 06:04.354
You're gonna get
your ring someday.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.297
I heard
that one before.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.493
Peace offering.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.741
Oops. Oh...

06:18.778 --> 06:20.905
that was
so not cool.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.949
Guys, relax.
It's not like

06:22.949 --> 06:24.007
we don't have
2 pounds of...

06:24.083 --> 06:26.677
oh, right.
Shh!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.778
What did you say?

06:28.855 --> 06:30.322
I don't remember.
I'm sorry.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.789
I got bad brain cells.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.223
Uh, "2 pounds of pot."

06:33.259 --> 06:34.817
Does that refresh
your memory?

06:34.861 --> 06:35.987
Don't listen
to him.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.155
He's baked,
and he's stupid.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.664
Baby, will you
please tell me

06:39.699 --> 06:42.065
that we did not go
to mexico to buy pot?

06:42.101 --> 06:45.559
We did not go
to mexico to buy pot.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.699
Hey, come on, baby.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.700
Look at me. I am not
a dope smuggler, ok?

06:52.745 --> 06:55.009
Tell me how much
you love me.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.139
How much?
That much.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.409
This much.
That much?

06:57.450 --> 06:59.111
That's it.
That's it.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.016
Ok.
Give me a kiss.

07:02.488 --> 07:06.618
Can you drive
possibly, please?

07:06.659 --> 07:08.183
Look out!

07:08.227 --> 07:09.251
Shit!

07:09.295 --> 07:11.058
Oh, shit!

07:17.537 --> 07:19.129
You almost hit her.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.639
What the fuck

07:20.673 --> 07:22.664
was she doing walking
in the middle of the road?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.374
Asshole.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.910
Hello?
Hey, are you ok?

07:34.987 --> 07:36.318
Boys, that's
a bad acid trip

07:36.355 --> 07:37.549
walking
right there.

07:37.590 --> 07:41.549
Hello?
Can you hear us?

07:41.594 --> 07:43.459
You're gonna
get killed doing that.

07:43.496 --> 07:47.193
Kemp, stop the van.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.996
Fuck that.
We got a concert to go to.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.832
We're still 3 fucking
hours from dallas!

07:50.870 --> 07:52.269
Where are you going?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.170
We're getting there.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.334
Get away.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.343
Hey...

07:58.411 --> 08:00.777
just need to get away.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.508
What?

08:02.548 --> 08:04.516
Got to get away.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.918
From who?

08:05.918 --> 08:07.647
I want to go home.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.245
Ok, we can't
leave her

08:09.288 --> 08:10.755
out here
like this.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.257
Hey, let us
help you, ok?

08:12.291 --> 08:14.259
Come on.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.261
Come on.
It's ok.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.729
It's ok.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.231
It's ok, man.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.700
We'll give you a ride,
wherever you want to go.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.703
I want to go home.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.602
Ok, we can
take you home.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.758
Um... what's your name?

08:47.793 --> 08:50.284
They're all dead.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.692
Oh, my god. I am
way too stoned for this.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.130
Baby, let's find
a hospital, ok?

09:01.173 --> 09:02.697
You know what?
Give me the vaguest idea

09:02.742 --> 09:04.573
where there is one,
and we'll go there.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.272
Um... who's dead?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.550
Kemper, didn't
your mother ever tell you

09:12.618 --> 09:15.314
not to pick up
hitchhikers?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.259
No.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.696
You're going
the wrong way.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.495
Stop! You're
going the wrong way!

09:28.534 --> 09:30.900
Hey, hey, hey!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.339
Jesus christ.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.505
You can't make me
go back there.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.106
I won't go back there.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.151
Back where?

09:53.359 --> 09:56.260
He's a bad man.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.822
He's a really bad man.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.372
He's a bad man.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.966
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.

10:13.412 --> 10:16.006
You're all gonna die.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.481
Drop it.
Drop it.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.921
Let me out!
Oh, my god!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.955
Are you
all right?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.389
It's too much.
I'm ok. I'm ok.

10:59.425 --> 11:02.826
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my god!

11:02.862 --> 11:04.329
Let me see.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.796
It's all over me!

11:05.831 --> 11:07.799
It's gone.
It's gone. Look.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.425
I could have fucking
died out there!

11:09.468 --> 11:11.493
We all could
have, morgan.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.806
Did that
just happen?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.312
I've never seen
anybody die before.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.076
Yeah, most people
never do.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.514
I really don't see

11:24.550 --> 11:26.017
how that's helping
us right now, man.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.916
I don't know
why we had to pick her up.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.156
Why the fuck
did we have to stop?

11:31.223 --> 11:33.555
She needed help!

11:33.592 --> 11:35.890
A lot of fucking
help we did her!

11:35.928 --> 11:38.055
Leave her alone.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.428
Fuck!

11:41.934 --> 11:45.392
I just don't understand.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.905
Why did she do it?

11:46.939 --> 11:49.407
And why did she
have to pick us?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.842
Why did she
have to pick us?

12:02.822 --> 12:04.449
What are we
gonna do?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.856
I don't know.
We're gonna...

12:08.694 --> 12:11.162
we're gonna have to
call the cops, i guess.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.324
Yeah, on the list
of bad ideas,

12:13.365 --> 12:15.128
that one goes
way up there.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.135
Are you kidding me?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.500
Oh, police officer,
please,

12:18.537 --> 12:20.004
as you inspect
the crime scene,

12:20.039 --> 12:21.506
which is now
our van,

12:21.540 --> 12:23.030
please ignore
the colorful pinata

12:23.075 --> 12:24.167
filled
with marijuana

12:24.210 --> 12:25.541
you may just happen
to come across,

12:25.611 --> 12:26.908
because it played
no part whatsoever

12:26.946 --> 12:29.346
in the demise of this
unfortunate young woman.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.851
Listen... keep
your goddamn voice down.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.386
Easy, easy, easy.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.412
Goddamn it.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.397
Well, you're not gonna
listen to him.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.763
What the fuck
are you doing?

12:49.435 --> 12:52.233
Uh!

12:54.740 --> 12:57.436
It's over, man.

12:57.476 --> 13:00.274
Kemp, you just can't
throw the shit out.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.149
You ok?

13:08.187 --> 13:09.654
Baby...

13:09.688 --> 13:13.317
i'm sorry, ok? I...

13:13.359 --> 13:15.327
i did it for us.

13:15.361 --> 13:19.320
I did it so we could
start a life, you know.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.857
I'm sorry. Ok?

13:31.544 --> 13:34.342
Well, i'll tell you this much...
there's no possible way

13:34.413 --> 13:36.142
i'm ever getting back
in that van.

13:47.426 --> 13:51.453
I guess that's what
brains look like, huh?

13:52.998 --> 13:57.901
Sort of like,
uh... lasagna...

13:57.937 --> 13:59.427
kind of.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.900
All right,
i'll shut up now.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.318
I'll tell you
this much...

14:13.385 --> 14:15.319
the next hitchhiker
is shit out of luck.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.083
I swear to god.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.590
Dude, gas station.

14:49.455 --> 14:53.414
Come on, erin.
Let's find the bathroom.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.471
Well, i'll be damned.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.832
Ma'am, we need
to report a suicide.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.710
Something like this
comes along,

15:14.780 --> 15:16.270
it makes folks realize

15:16.348 --> 15:18.816
how crazy the world
is out there.

15:18.851 --> 15:19.977
Right.

15:20.052 --> 15:23.078
Would you mind calling
the sheriff, ma'am?

15:23.155 --> 15:25.783
It's gonna cost you
10 cents.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.131
You want some pig?

15:48.914 --> 15:51.610
Big brothers.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.650
I just feel
so disgusting.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.860
Oh, there's about
6 of them altogether,

16:01.894 --> 16:08.197
counting the dead one.
Poor thing. It's awful.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.600
Well, why don't you
ask them yourself?

16:11.637 --> 16:15.505
Right. Where did you say
you found her again?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.270
Ma'am, i already
told you.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.300
About 10 minutes
west of here.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.406
About 5 miles west.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.418
Ma'am, excuse me.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.580
When is the sheriff
gonna be here?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.122
Sheriff said
he's headed over

16:31.190 --> 16:33.181
to the old
crawford mill.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.419
I'm sorry.
The what?

16:35.461 --> 16:37.326
The old crawford mill.
He wants to know

16:37.363 --> 16:39.331
if you wouldn't mind
driving over there

16:39.365 --> 16:41.333
to make your report.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.493
Yes.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.126
Yes, we
goddamn mind.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.828
I'm sorry,
but how often

16:46.872 --> 16:48.840
do girls just blow
their heads off

16:48.874 --> 16:50.774
in this shit-hole town?

16:50.809 --> 16:52.504
All right,
just calm down, ok?

16:52.544 --> 16:54.341
Let me... i'm sorry.
I apologize.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.880
But, ma'am,
i don't understand.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.381
Why the hell
won't the sheriff

16:57.416 --> 16:58.883
just come out here?

16:58.917 --> 17:00.817
Didn't say.
He said it would be

17:00.853 --> 17:02.844
about 2 hours
before he could get here.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.752
We're not gonna drive
around this town

17:04.790 --> 17:07.724
with a dead girl
in the back of our van!

17:09.627 --> 17:12.256
Young man...

17:12.297 --> 17:16.665
what you do
is your own business.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.817
Come on.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.980
Get in.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.325
I just want
to go home, ok?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.351
That's fine.

18:23.902 --> 18:26.166
It's starting
to stink back here.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.469
No worse than the inside
of that fucking store.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.668
Did you smell
that nasty beef shit?

18:33.979 --> 18:35.378
Oh, my god.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.216
Guys.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.742
Hello!

19:10.749 --> 19:12.239
Hello?

19:22.294 --> 19:26.025
Ain't no
sheriff here.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.554
I think we should
drop off the body

19:27.599 --> 19:29.123
and get the hell
out of here.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.729
Maybe we should
vote on it.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.763
Kemper, no.

19:35.807 --> 19:40.369
Why not, erin?
It is a democracy.

19:40.412 --> 19:41.902
Well, how would
you like it

19:41.947 --> 19:44.108
if we just dumped
your body out here?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.207
I'm sorry.
Nobody asked her

19:45.284 --> 19:46.273
to blow her head off
in our van.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.375
My van.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.383
I say we dump her.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.827
Pig.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.990
Cool. All right. Fine.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.863
2 votes.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.666
Now we just need
one more. Kemper?

20:05.704 --> 20:08.673
One more and we're
out of here.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.402
Kemper, please?

20:17.516 --> 20:19.711
Baby, she's dead.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.383
I just...
i really don't think

20:23.422 --> 20:25.322
it matters
where we leave her.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.383
Well, it matters to me...
if that means anything.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.985
Erin, look...

20:30.028 --> 20:31.461
that girl has got parents
out there somewhere

20:31.496 --> 20:32.861
who's gonna want her back,

20:32.898 --> 20:34.490
not just dumped
on the side of the road

20:34.533 --> 20:37.161
like a piece of trash.

20:42.674 --> 20:47.134
You see our lone ranger
anywhere?

20:49.748 --> 20:52.945
Maybe this
isn't the crawford mill.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.149
It's unbelievable.

20:58.223 --> 20:59.952
This is a joke.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.323
There's nobody here.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.361
There's no sheriff here.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.757
What?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.165
I just saw something
move in there.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.499
I just saw something.

21:11.536 --> 21:12.833
I swear to god,

21:12.871 --> 21:14.168
i just saw something
move in there.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.833
You're just trying
to scare me into leaving.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.171
Erin, come on.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.506
Go to hell.

21:18.543 --> 21:19.805
Erin, come on.
Quit screwing around.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.599
Aah! Kemper!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.699
Erin!

21:50.742 --> 21:52.903
Erin!

21:52.944 --> 21:55.344
Erin, where are you?

22:05.857 --> 22:07.324
All right.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.348
Go.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.333
I got it.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.857
Ok.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.273
Damn it!
Give me...

22:30.916 --> 22:32.406
give me something
to hold this.

22:32.484 --> 22:36.011
It's a possum,
indigenous to the...

22:39.024 --> 22:41.424
i didn't do that.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.921
All right.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.402
All right, that's it!
If somebody's out there,

22:51.436 --> 22:53.904
just stop fucking around,
all right?

22:53.939 --> 22:56.134
I mean it!
Just come on out!

23:08.253 --> 23:10.221
Who are you?

23:13.859 --> 23:16.419
What did you do to her?

23:16.461 --> 23:18.895
Huh?

23:18.930 --> 23:22.730
The girl out there,
in the van.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.236
We didn't do
anything to her.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.738
She did that
to herself.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.871
Oh, my god.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.388
Promise
you won't hurt me?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.259
Hey, you make these?

24:03.341 --> 24:06.777
Hey, bud. Hey.

24:06.812 --> 24:10.304
This is the old
crawford mill, right?

24:13.218 --> 24:15.778
My name is erin.

24:15.854 --> 24:18.687
Jedidiah.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.260
Hey, junior.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.561
So, we're waiting here
for the sheriff.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.191
Do you know
where he is?

24:30.535 --> 24:32.162
Ok. Well... where?

24:33.371 --> 24:36.465
Home...
getting drunk.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.442
So, cool.
Um, let's split.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.341
If the sheriff
doesn't give a shit,

24:40.412 --> 24:42.107
then why should we?

24:42.180 --> 24:44.910
Does he live
around here?

24:46.852 --> 24:48.342
You know,
front-row tickets

24:48.420 --> 24:50.388
to a big concert.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.515
Can we drive
there from here?

24:52.557 --> 24:54.752
Road don't go there.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.260
Short walk, though.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.886
I think
we should go,

24:57.929 --> 25:00.261
like now,
like right now.

25:01.633 --> 25:03.225
How do i get
to the sheriff's?

25:37.903 --> 25:41.339
Whoa! Hey, you sick
little mutant.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on now. Let go.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.212
Get out of here.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.872
That's
police evidence.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.250
Is anybody home?

26:28.286 --> 26:30.481
Hello!

26:30.522 --> 26:32.012
What do you want?

26:32.090 --> 26:33.819
Um... are you
the sheriff?

26:33.858 --> 26:36.326
Do i look
like a sheriff?

26:36.361 --> 26:38.522
I don't know.
I can't see you.

26:38.563 --> 26:40.360
Stand back
from the door.

26:49.374 --> 26:52.639
Sheriff don't live here.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.770
You can call him
if you want to.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.839
Thanks. We'd really
appreciate it.

26:59.651 --> 27:00.919
Wipe your feet.

27:00.919 --> 27:04.252
I like to keep
a clean house.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.252
I said
she could call him.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.388
You wait outside.

27:12.430 --> 27:13.624
Ok, chief.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.496
I ain't looking
for trouble.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.761
Don't shoot.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.001
There.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.759
I'll dial him
for you.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.750
Hello?

28:06.785 --> 28:08.844
Hi. Is... is this
the sheriff's office?

28:08.920 --> 28:12.014
Can i speak
to him, please?

28:26.337 --> 28:28.237
Oh, thank god.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.831
Now, it's just
an educated guess,

28:54.866 --> 28:57.334
but my money says
your dead body

28:57.368 --> 28:59.996
is right there
in that van.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.733
30 minutes? Believe me,
we will be there.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.648
Thanks. I'm all set.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.844
Wait. Wait.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.787
Can you help me out
back here?

29:32.804 --> 29:34.271
Are you ok?

29:34.305 --> 29:36.603
Could you just...

29:36.641 --> 29:37.938
ok.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.552
Excuse me.

29:50.588 --> 29:51.850
Erin?

29:53.358 --> 29:55.019
Excuse me.

30:06.371 --> 30:07.861
Erin?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.841
Excuse me.
You mind getting

30:16.915 --> 30:18.883
the fuck out
of my way, son?

30:21.886 --> 30:23.353
We picked her up

30:23.421 --> 30:26.390
on the side
of the road, like...

30:26.424 --> 30:29.916
wow. Look at that mess.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.702
Who's this belong to?

30:42.740 --> 30:45.766
She had that
on her, sir.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.312
You don't say.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.848
Had it on her?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.442
Yes, sir.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.390
Ok, if you could
just relax,

31:02.427 --> 31:04.361
because you're
not helping.

31:10.201 --> 31:13.466
Good girl,
good girl.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.379
Pig sty.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.961
Oh, jesus.

32:22.373 --> 32:24.102
What the hell
was that?

32:27.845 --> 32:29.870
Kemper?

32:30.915 --> 32:32.041
Kemp?

32:41.092 --> 32:44.584
Ha. Well, let's get her
wrapped up.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.337
Oh, preffy
little thing.

32:54.372 --> 32:58.103
How about giving me
a hand here, asshole?

32:58.142 --> 33:02.272
You don't expect me
to do this by myself?

33:02.347 --> 33:04.815
I need some help.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.320
Why do i always get
yanked into this shit?

33:09.354 --> 33:10.946
What am i doing?

33:11.022 --> 33:12.148
Lift her up
and just kind of

33:12.190 --> 33:13.851
pull her over
your way there.

33:13.891 --> 33:15.358
She ain't
gonna bite you.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.951
She's deader than
a goddamn doornail.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.825
Get ahold of her
and pick her up.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.353
Yes, sir.

33:22.367 --> 33:25.200
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.836
I bet she's
real unhappy,

33:28.873 --> 33:31.341
real sorry that you're
getting fuckin' her blood

33:31.376 --> 33:34.345
all over
your goddamn arm.

33:34.412 --> 33:37.848
You know, back when
i was a young patrolman,

33:37.915 --> 33:40.383
i used to love wrapping up
these young honies.

33:40.418 --> 33:41.885
Yeah, i bet you did.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.887
Yeah, cop me
a little bit of a feel

33:43.921 --> 33:45.855
every now and then,
you know.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.884
Oh, look at that.
She's kind of wet down there.

33:50.928 --> 33:52.520
What you boys been doing

33:52.563 --> 33:54.053
with this dead body anyway?

33:54.098 --> 33:56.328
Can we please
finish this?

34:02.006 --> 34:03.803
Kemper?

34:06.811 --> 34:08.301
Kemp?

34:35.373 --> 34:37.398
Something wrong?

34:37.442 --> 34:39.170
Where is he?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.699
I don't know.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.735
But he's not
in my house.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.782
Thanks.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.051
Kemper?

34:58.930 --> 35:00.522
Kemp?

35:04.635 --> 35:07.729
Goddamn him.

35:07.772 --> 35:10.707
Ok, boys, there you go.
There she is.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.709
Let's get her
out of there now.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.768
You, four-eyes, get a hold
of her legs there.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.280
Get after
that part of it.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.782
I got her head.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.272
Oh...

35:19.350 --> 35:20.317
fuck.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.251
Come on.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.947
Ow! Shit.

35:23.988 --> 35:27.048
Just stick her
in the back seat.

35:27.091 --> 35:30.356
It just seems
so wrong.

35:30.394 --> 35:33.830
Don't give me
any crap, young lady.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.833
Goddamn it, i got
just as much respect

35:35.867 --> 35:38.631
for a dead body
as anybody around here.

35:38.669 --> 35:42.332
Hey! Get that nasty
goddamn thing

35:42.373 --> 35:44.841
out of the back seat
of my goddamn car!

35:44.876 --> 35:46.343
Put it in the trunk.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.877
What the hell's
the matter with you?

35:49.914 --> 35:51.215
Put the legs.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.512
Don't break
my stuff.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.743
Put the legs in.

36:02.026 --> 36:03.254
Y'all gonna be able

36:03.294 --> 36:04.761
to find your way
out of here ok?

36:04.795 --> 36:06.262
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be fine.

36:06.297 --> 36:07.628
All right, then.

36:09.300 --> 36:12.269
Protect and serve.
That's what we do.

36:12.303 --> 36:14.794
That you did, sir.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.302
Kemp!

36:31.355 --> 36:33.152
Kemper!

37:23.975 --> 37:25.806
Kemper!

37:35.653 --> 37:37.280
Poor kemp. I mean,
he ain't ever

37:37.355 --> 37:39.323
gonna get the stink
out of this van.

37:39.357 --> 37:42.326
You think we should try
to clean it for him?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.351
Be my guest.

37:50.301 --> 37:51.928
You ok?

37:51.969 --> 37:54.699
It's too much.
I'm gonna be sick.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.833
Ok, good news.
Sheriff's on his way.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.866
The sheriff already came.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.472
He took the body.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.708
Where's kemper?

38:05.783 --> 38:07.546
Isn't he with you?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.757
Kemper?

38:13.791 --> 38:15.691
What the hell is that?

38:19.397 --> 38:21.456
Kemper!

38:23.801 --> 38:24.790
Kemp!

38:38.382 --> 38:41.476
There's nobody
even here.

38:43.888 --> 38:44.855
Kemp!

38:44.889 --> 38:46.481
What was that
all about?

38:46.524 --> 38:49.925
Kemper!

38:49.960 --> 38:53.396
What is that?
Oh...

38:53.431 --> 38:55.456
it's somebody's
fucking teeth, isn't it?

38:55.499 --> 38:57.399
Pepper, look, just
calm down, all right?

38:57.435 --> 38:59.733
Erin, find your goddamn
boyfriend. It's time to go.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.233
Kemper!

39:06.911 --> 39:09.004
Kemp!

39:17.121 --> 39:18.918
Morgan, what
are you doing?

39:24.462 --> 39:27.056
Help him! Help him!

39:27.098 --> 39:28.725
Oh, my god!

39:28.766 --> 39:30.165
Pull him! Pull him!

39:30.201 --> 39:31.600
I can't!

39:31.635 --> 39:33.102
Oh, my god.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.263
Ha ha ha!

39:34.305 --> 39:35.272
You stupid...

39:35.306 --> 39:36.796
that's not funny.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.911
Oh, what the hell
is that?

39:47.618 --> 39:50.678
Is that the girl
from our van?

39:50.721 --> 39:52.211
That's her.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.521
Is that her family?

40:00.197 --> 40:03.564
What were
they all doing here?

40:03.601 --> 40:06.570
They were probably
looking for the sheriff.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.305
It's fucking weird.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.399
All right, you know what?

40:11.442 --> 40:12.909
Let's find
kemper

40:12.943 --> 40:14.638
and get the hell
out of here.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.374
Where you going?

40:19.450 --> 40:21.680
To find him.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.813
Well, where are
the keys for the van?

40:28.225 --> 40:30.750
Well, who put you
in charge?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.227
If you guys just want
to take off, that's fine,

40:34.265 --> 40:35.732
but i am not
getting in that van

40:35.766 --> 40:37.233
and leaving
without him.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.394
Give me the keys.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.836
Don't even
think about it.

40:40.871 --> 40:42.930
Andy...

40:42.973 --> 40:44.907
i don't know about
you guys, but i happen

40:44.942 --> 40:46.739
to like my teeth
right where they are.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.335
I can't leave him.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.347
Let's go.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.314
We'll meet you
back at the van.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.821
I know
kemp's in there.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.225
Wonderful.

41:37.261 --> 41:39.923
All right,
keep him busy.

41:48.272 --> 41:49.899
Hi. It's me again.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.908
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

41:51.942 --> 41:54.445
but i can't find
my boyfriend kemper anywhere,

41:54.445 --> 41:56.447
and i thought
i would just...

41:56.447 --> 41:58.574
ain't you supposed
to meet the sheriff?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.352
Kemper?

42:18.369 --> 42:20.860
Kemp, don't mess around.

42:23.474 --> 42:27.308
Um... wow. What... what
a wonderful garden you have.

42:27.344 --> 42:31.940
It's just so...
plentiful. Ha ha.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.355
Oh!

43:28.339 --> 43:30.569
Damn it!

43:33.911 --> 43:35.970
Andy!

43:36.013 --> 43:38.983
Hey, you can't
just go in my house!

43:38.983 --> 43:40.416
Andy!

43:43.287 --> 43:45.380
Are you ok?

43:45.422 --> 43:47.117
Yeah.

43:51.929 --> 43:54.796
What the hell are you doing
in my house?

43:55.933 --> 43:57.332
All right, look.
We're just looking

43:57.368 --> 43:58.767
for our friend,
all right?

43:58.802 --> 44:00.064
Then we'll be
out of here.

44:00.104 --> 44:02.163
You ain't
running things, boy...

44:02.206 --> 44:03.764
exceptin' your mouth.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.900
This guy's crazy.

44:05.943 --> 44:08.275
You little turd,

44:08.312 --> 44:11.076
you're so dead,
you don't even know it.

44:14.418 --> 44:16.477
Come on, boy.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.078
Bring it!

44:18.155 --> 44:19.486
Bring it.

44:19.523 --> 44:20.888
Bring what?

44:20.924 --> 44:21.891
Bring it.

44:32.369 --> 44:33.597
Shit!

44:36.507 --> 44:38.441
Come on!

44:38.475 --> 44:40.500
Andy!

44:49.119 --> 44:51.451
Get the fuck
out of here! Run!

45:30.527 --> 45:33.758
Shit! God!

45:54.918 --> 45:56.977
Please!

45:57.054 --> 45:58.954
Please! Stop! No!

45:58.989 --> 46:01.787
Please! Put me...

46:03.560 --> 46:05.585
shit!

46:05.629 --> 46:08.223
Erin! Erin!

46:08.265 --> 46:10.927
Erin!

46:14.271 --> 46:18.367
Ugh! Kemper really
owes us for this.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.611
What the fuck's
wrong, erin?

46:24.681 --> 46:25.943
Erin, are you ok?

46:26.016 --> 46:28.849
Where's the gun?
Come on!

46:28.886 --> 46:30.148
Erin, what's
going on?

46:30.187 --> 46:31.848
Where's the gun?

46:31.889 --> 46:33.982
The sheriff
took it.

46:34.057 --> 46:36.150
Shit!

46:36.193 --> 46:38.320
Erin, what the fuck's
going on? Calm down!

46:38.362 --> 46:39.386
Fuck!

46:39.429 --> 46:40.657
What?
What?

46:43.500 --> 46:45.331
Oh, thank god.
Oh, thank god.

46:45.369 --> 46:46.836
Take it easy.

46:46.870 --> 46:48.838
Thank god. My friend...
my friend needs help!

46:48.872 --> 46:50.840
My friend right now...
my friend's dying!

46:50.874 --> 46:52.432
My friend's being hurt!

46:52.476 --> 46:54.444
Take a couple
of deep breaths.

46:54.511 --> 46:56.342
There's some guy...
just...

46:56.413 --> 46:58.608
just quiet down.

46:59.917 --> 47:00.815
Please.

47:00.851 --> 47:02.751
Now, what's wrong
with your car?

47:02.786 --> 47:04.754
There's nothing
wrong with my car.

47:04.788 --> 47:06.085
Whoa.

47:06.123 --> 47:08.591
It's my friend.
Please help him.

47:08.625 --> 47:11.253
I don't know
where he is anymore.

47:11.295 --> 47:13.559
Somebody want to
explain this?

47:13.597 --> 47:17.089
Lt... that's not mine.

47:17.134 --> 47:20.831
You kids
taking drugs?

47:20.871 --> 47:22.202
No.
No.

47:22.239 --> 47:24.230
It's not our van.

47:27.978 --> 47:31.175
I smell bullshit.

47:33.317 --> 47:35.285
Get out of the van!

47:35.319 --> 47:36.786
Out!

47:40.524 --> 47:45.655
On your faces,
all 3 of you!

47:45.696 --> 47:47.630
Get on the ground!

48:59.269 --> 49:01.703
Arizona...

49:01.738 --> 49:04.229
colorado...

49:04.274 --> 49:06.970
new york.

49:07.044 --> 49:09.205
Please, you've
got to help us!

49:09.246 --> 49:10.907
He's fucking
killing him!

49:10.948 --> 49:12.745
Now we're getting
someplace.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.183
Who's killing who?

49:15.218 --> 49:16.617
There's
some fucking guy

49:16.653 --> 49:18.245
with a fucking
chainsaw!

49:18.288 --> 49:21.257
Get your sweet little ass
back in the dirt

49:21.291 --> 49:24.055
until i say otherwise.

49:26.630 --> 49:29.292
You know what i think?

49:29.333 --> 49:31.767
I think your boyfriend
shot that little girl

49:31.802 --> 49:33.463
and then he ran off.

49:33.503 --> 49:34.970
He did not!

49:35.005 --> 49:36.700
Some fucking guy
with a...

49:39.109 --> 49:40.736
stop! Stop!

49:40.777 --> 49:42.279
We're all gonna die!

49:42.279 --> 49:44.270
You girls better get yourselves
under control,

49:44.348 --> 49:46.282
or i'm gonna have to
do it for you.

49:46.316 --> 49:48.307
Why won't you
listen to her?

49:49.353 --> 49:51.287
Get on your feet.

49:51.321 --> 49:53.755
Get over
by the van.

49:53.790 --> 49:54.779
Please stop.

49:54.858 --> 49:58.225
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

49:58.261 --> 50:01.992
I want to know exactly
what happened inside that van.

50:02.032 --> 50:04.728
We already told you
what happened.

50:04.768 --> 50:07.737
And now you're
gonna show me.

50:55.952 --> 50:58.819
Is that where
she was sitting?

50:58.855 --> 51:01.688
Because the angle
don't add up for me

51:01.725 --> 51:04.193
with the blood
on that back window.

51:13.370 --> 51:16.635
Maybe she was
a bit more in the middle.

51:16.673 --> 51:18.834
Well, maybe
you ought to move

51:18.875 --> 51:21.275
a little more
over to the middle.

51:21.311 --> 51:22.869
But...

51:25.282 --> 51:28.683
what, are you afraid
of a little blood?

51:30.153 --> 51:33.281
Get the fuck
over there!

51:39.162 --> 51:42.757
I don't have much
of an imagination,

51:42.799 --> 51:47.463
so i need to get
a distinct image

51:47.504 --> 51:49.904
of what
went down here.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.033
What did
she do next?

51:52.075 --> 51:54.441
She...

51:55.946 --> 51:57.948
she shot herself.

51:57.948 --> 52:00.041
Oh, she
shot herself.

52:01.485 --> 52:02.679
How?

52:02.719 --> 52:05.381
What do you mean, how?

52:05.422 --> 52:09.051
Take the gun.

52:09.092 --> 52:10.821
Take the gun
and show me

52:10.861 --> 52:13.887
how she did it.
Come on.

52:13.930 --> 52:17.798
Take the gun.
Take the gun

52:17.834 --> 52:20.098
and show me.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.970
Take the goddamn gun!

52:28.512 --> 52:30.742
Is that
how she did it?

52:30.814 --> 52:33.544
Yes. Yes, sir.

52:33.617 --> 52:35.551
You're
a fucking liar.

52:35.585 --> 52:37.052
There ain't no hole

52:37.087 --> 52:39.317
in the bottom of
her chin. I looked.

52:39.356 --> 52:41.881
She stuck
the goddamn weapon

52:41.925 --> 52:43.552
into her mouth.

52:43.593 --> 52:45.424
Didn't she?

52:47.764 --> 52:50.961
Show me
how she did it.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.696
Do it!
Please...

52:52.736 --> 52:54.499
show me.

52:56.873 --> 52:58.738
Please, please, please,
please, please...

52:58.775 --> 53:01.266
that a boy.
There you go.

53:01.378 --> 53:04.279
And then what
did she do?

53:04.347 --> 53:06.281
She shot herself.

53:06.316 --> 53:08.284
You ain't lying
to me again, are you?

53:08.351 --> 53:10.319
Because i have never
seen a weapon go off

53:10.353 --> 53:14.187
without somebody's finger
on the fucking trigger.

53:14.224 --> 53:16.749
Morgan, what's going on?
You ok?

53:16.793 --> 53:19.159
You girls
stay in the dirt

53:19.196 --> 53:20.390
till i tell you
different.

53:20.430 --> 53:25.424
You mother fucker!
Get on the fucking floor!

53:25.468 --> 53:27.163
I said get on the floor!

53:27.204 --> 53:28.637
What the hell
are you doing?

53:28.672 --> 53:31.163
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

53:31.208 --> 53:32.505
Morgan, please,
please.

53:32.542 --> 53:34.032
Just please put
the gun down, ok?

53:34.110 --> 53:35.270
Please don't do it.

53:35.312 --> 53:36.540
Oh, my god. Morgan.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.415
You lyin' fuck!

53:38.415 --> 53:39.905
You could kill me
right now,

53:39.950 --> 53:41.815
get out of here
scot-free, couldn't you?

53:41.851 --> 53:43.614
Morgan, please,
just put it down.

53:43.653 --> 53:47.555
He shoots me,
you're accomplices to murder!

53:47.591 --> 53:49.024
Morgan...

53:49.059 --> 53:51.755
please. Please!
Come on!

53:51.795 --> 53:54.491
Morgan! Damn!

53:54.531 --> 53:56.260
Fucking shoot him!

53:56.299 --> 53:58.494
Morgan,
put the gun down.

53:58.535 --> 54:00.230
Shoot him!
Don't fucking do it!

54:00.270 --> 54:03.205
You don't have
the fucking balls, do you?

54:05.942 --> 54:07.466
Pull the fucking trigger!

54:07.510 --> 54:09.569
Fuck you!

54:13.350 --> 54:16.717
Well, well, well.
Looky here.

54:16.753 --> 54:18.084
Oh, my god, morgan.

54:18.121 --> 54:20.316
We got ourselves
a killer,

54:20.357 --> 54:22.052
only this time,

54:22.092 --> 54:24.026
you killed
a sheriff.

54:29.966 --> 54:32.457
I ought to blow
your fucking brains

54:32.502 --> 54:34.265
out right now,
asshole.

54:34.304 --> 54:36.067
Get out of the van.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.801
Get out.

54:37.841 --> 54:40.366
Get out of the van.

54:42.612 --> 54:45.080
Morgan.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.844
Where are you
taking him?

54:46.916 --> 54:48.383
What are you doing?

54:48.418 --> 54:50.886
Where are you taking him?
Jesus christ!

54:50.920 --> 54:53.912
Get the fuck
away from me!

55:46.376 --> 55:48.173
Man, this is bullshit.

55:53.917 --> 55:55.817
I have rights.

55:57.053 --> 55:59.783
Yeah, you got
rights, ok.

55:59.823 --> 56:02.417
Where was
y'all headed?

56:02.459 --> 56:03.926
Dallas...

56:05.462 --> 56:07.293
for a skynyrd concert.

56:07.330 --> 56:11.198
Skynyrd? Hell,
i like skynyrd.

56:11.234 --> 56:12.758
By god,
how about that?

56:12.802 --> 56:15.100
We got something
in common, don't we?

56:15.138 --> 56:16.628
Ha ha ha.

56:16.673 --> 56:18.265
Well, what
are you gonna do

56:18.308 --> 56:20.708
with your tickets
now, hot shot?

56:25.682 --> 56:27.149
You can have them.

56:27.183 --> 56:29.947
Is that bribery?

56:34.791 --> 56:38.386
Oh, that was really
rude, wasn't it?

56:39.863 --> 56:42.764
Oh, look at you.

56:44.267 --> 56:46.394
How about that?

56:49.372 --> 56:50.839
Look at that shit.

56:50.874 --> 56:54.002
We got something
else in common now.

56:54.043 --> 56:56.910
Ha ha ha. See that?

57:04.154 --> 57:06.748
Get on over to the damn
crawford mill.

57:06.790 --> 57:10.248
Those 2 fillies
are good to go.

57:18.301 --> 57:19.268
Shit.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.270
What do you think
he's doing to morgan?

57:21.304 --> 57:24.467
I don't want to
think about it, ok?

57:30.046 --> 57:31.809
Oh, shit!

57:31.881 --> 57:33.781
Pepper, i need you

57:33.850 --> 57:35.818
to hold that light
really steady.

57:35.852 --> 57:37.979
Can you do that?

57:49.165 --> 57:50.530
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

57:50.567 --> 57:54.401
In juvie. They call
my youth misspent.

57:54.437 --> 57:56.200
Oh, thank god.

58:14.791 --> 58:16.315
Get out of the car.

58:16.359 --> 58:17.792
Where are we?

58:17.827 --> 58:20.318
That's none of your
goddamn business, faggot!

58:20.363 --> 58:22.957
Just get out
of the goddamn car!

58:30.807 --> 58:33.901
You kids shouldn't have
messed with that little girl.

58:36.946 --> 58:40.109
You brought this all
on yourself.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.811
Now get the hell
in the house!

58:45.154 --> 58:46.485
Come on, please.

58:46.523 --> 58:47.751
Come on.

58:50.593 --> 58:51.685
Come on.

58:51.728 --> 58:53.696
Come on, erin.
Come on!

58:53.730 --> 58:55.163
Yes!
Yes!

58:57.800 --> 58:59.791
Go, go, go!

59:15.151 --> 59:18.814
Aah! Go! Go!

59:52.155 --> 59:54.680
Help, pepper! No!

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.523
Pepper!

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:12.806
Run!

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.911
No! No, pepper!

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:08.330
Please! Please!
Please let me in!

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:11.333
Please! Help me, please!

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:13.858
Come on. Come on.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.325
Why don't you
have a seat?

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.488
It's ok. Sit down.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.762
Have a seat.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:48.202
Turn that thing off!
He's gonna fucking hear us!

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:03.248
There's nothing a good old
cup of tea won't settle.

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:10.056
Nobody's gonna come
through that door.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:12.755
I really need
to use your phone.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.820
We don't have one.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.492
Phones are a hassle.

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:23.903
No! Don't you get it?

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.534
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill all of us.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.136
Oh, no, he won't.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.703
Yes, he will.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:36.775
He knows better than
to be messing around here.

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:40.311
Everyone around here
knows that...

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.483
poor sweet boy.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:43.958
Sweet boy.

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.893
He's no harm.

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:48.897
He always keeps
to himself.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:52.890
Skin disease.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:56.962
He was just a little boy
when it started.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.440
Didn't you look
at his face?

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:03.675
I couldn't.
I couldn't look at him.

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:07.011
Oh, sweetie. Here.

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.581
Here. It's just...
just right.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.318
Come drink some
before it gets cold.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.258
You have no idea.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:22.064
Hush now.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.157
I don't want to drink
any more tea!

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.497
I just need a phone!

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:28.504
Now you see
what you've done?

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:32.339
Oh. Ha ha...

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.434
that wasn't
a good idea.

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:43.744
Now, drink up your tea.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.084
It'll help you relax.

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:48.920
I'll be right back.

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.888
You're
a little tense.

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:58.162
You should relax.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.975
I got to go.

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.844
You ok, child?

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.182
You don't look
so good.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:56.517
I thought you said
you didn't have a phone.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:00.017
It's ok.
It's all right.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.397
That's not your baby.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:10.598
You stole her!

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:16.175
She's mine.

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:39.929
Oh, my. Oh, my,
my, my, my, my.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:43.700
Everything's gonna be fine
real soon.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:46.537
I promise.

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:03.719
Give her some room.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:07.559
Maybe she'd like to
stay for supper.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.325
Messed up
everything already.

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.832
Stop bothering her.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.834
Grandma!
Let me in now!

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:15.462
You best stay out there
with them dogs

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:18.940
till you learn
how to play by the rules.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:23.036
You're not going
nowhere, honey.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:28.281
Please. Please
just let me go.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:31.252
I know your kind...

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:35.621
nothing but cruelty
and ridicule for my boy,

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:39.025
all the time
he was growing up.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:45.266
Does anybody care
about me and my boy?

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.696
Huh?

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.262
Don't hurt her!
Please, grandma.

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.069
You shut up
out there!

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.339
Help me! Please!
Make them stop!

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.572
Looky, mama.
She likes me.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:02.207
What's wrong with
you fucking people?

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.752
Nothing
wrong with us.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.287
Tommy.

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.822
Help me, please!

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.757
Thomas brown hewitt,

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.488

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.263
No! No!

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.265
Get her out of my sight.

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.664
No! Please! No!

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:19.793
Please!

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.602
Will you cut out
that racket?

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:29.269
Here's
your pants.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.801
Thank you.

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.811
No!

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.758
Oh, my god.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:09:00.200

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:04.130
Ok.

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:10.542
Lift your body.
Lift your body up.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:11.841
Stop!

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:13.073
Push!

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.348

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.926
Sorry.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:40.609
Erin, i'm dead.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.577
Please finish it.

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:46.581
You can do it.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.277
I can't.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:53.278
I can't. I can't.
I can't.

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:54.879
There's a knife.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.985
Erin...

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.383

Do it!

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:43.996
I can't do it.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.098
Do it!

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:55.749
Do it. Do it.

Please forgive me.

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:23.878
Please forgive me.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:15.263
Morgan, it's me!

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:16.389

Come on, morgan.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:37.983
We got to go.

Go now!

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:42.713

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:43.884
Ok, morgan, come on.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.917
Morgan, get up.

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.526
Over here.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:53.535
Let's go. Walk.
We need you to lead us.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:07.775

Come on! Don't
let him get you!

Come on!

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.637
Get up there!

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:47.444
Go! Go!

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.158
I'll be fine.

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:16.480
Come on, morgan!
Come on!

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:01.696
Morgan, the couch!

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:04.290
The couch!

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.707
No!

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.721

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:43.773
I give her a ride.

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.910
I found her running
down the highway.

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:47.079
I don't know her name.

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:50.823
She grabbed
the steering wheel

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:53.326
and dang near
run me off the road.

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.329
She nearly caused us
to crash.

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.160
Yes, she grabbed it
while i was driving.

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.428
She's hysterical.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:02.197
She's out there
in the truck.

01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:04.227
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:18.445
The baby's gone!

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:32.426

This is august 20, 1973.

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:49.630
Our location is
the hewitt residence.

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.400
We're gonna go and move
into the actual furnace room.

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:55.898
Watch yourself.
Look out.

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:58.946

was not properly secured

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.977
by travis county police.

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:38.383

were fatally wounded that day.

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:42.355

of thomas hewitt,

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:45.392
the man they call
leatherface.

01:32:45.426 --> 01:32:48.918

still remains open.
