[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.341 --> 00:08.592
[BO] You're messing
with someone's life.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.962
[JACK] She wanted this more
than anything in the world.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.215
[LAUREN] I took the antidote.
I'm not Fae anymore.

00:13.431 --> 00:14.546
We're over.

00:14.765 --> 00:18.428
[JACK] We are capable of
many things, but love...

00:18.644 --> 00:20.600
Remember, with great power
comes great resp--

00:20.813 --> 00:22.849
Okay, Voltaire!

00:23.065 --> 00:24.100
[ZEE] Never forget.

00:24.317 --> 00:27.901
Hades' evil
comes in many forms.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.988
[TRICK] In lore, the horseshoe
symbolizes protection.

00:33.201 --> 00:36.068
lt wards off evil
and brings good luck.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.528
A weapon.
Forged by the gods.

00:38.748 --> 00:40.204
Just for me.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.826
And this is what I get.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.783
It's not that bad.

00:44.003 --> 00:44.992
[TAMSIN] Look.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.376
[sighs] Okay.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.547
You can punch with it.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.845
[TAMSIN] You can...
scratch your back.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.548
--[TAMS|N] You can throw it.
--[BO] Uh, no.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.304
Think fast!

01:03.272 --> 01:04.978
Of course.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.681
Jackpot.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.232
[TAMSIN] Ugh! Ever since
I took down Freyja,

01:09.445 --> 01:11.356
I've been starving.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.187
[BO] Seriously,

01:13.407 --> 01:15.022
what am I supposed
to do with this, huh?

01:15.243 --> 01:17.985
Last thing I need is another
freakinI mystery in my life.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.240
Didn't Trick say you
need it for protection.

01:20.456 --> 01:21.286
[BO] From what?

01:21.499 --> 01:23.706
The obvious.
Jack-in-a-glass-box.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.034
If the king of the underworld
ever becomes a problem

01:26.254 --> 01:29.462
I'm gonna need something a
lot sharper than a horseshoe.

01:32.218 --> 01:33.628
Like this?

01:35.054 --> 01:36.385
[TAMSIN]
Stole it from Zee and Hera.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.178
The Amethusto dagger.

01:38.391 --> 01:39.927
[TAMSIN] The cut your daddy
out of your life dagger.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.552
[BO]
Whoa, Tamsin, wait.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.930
[TAMSIN] The longer we wait,
the stronger he gets.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.637
It's only a matter of time
before Jack makes his move.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.233
Yeah, and your only
operation experience

01:48.442 --> 01:50.103
is the board game.

01:50.319 --> 01:53.231
Fine. If you wanna call your
emotionally unstable ex.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.527
Even after we...

01:54.740 --> 01:56.901
[BO] All our lives, all we're
told over and over again

01:57.118 --> 01:59.450
is the importance of family.

01:59.662 --> 02:03.075
Like it or not, he's mine.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.701
[TAMSIN] True.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.124
Or... Are your family the ones

02:07.336 --> 02:09.418
who've been there
for you all along?

02:17.847 --> 02:19.007
[NURSE]
Always the same.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.724
Two of the greens.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.343
One of the blues.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.222
Don't talk to her.

02:25.438 --> 02:28.430
Don't look at her.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.767
And whatever you do,
don't touch her.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.031
It's time for your meds.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.657
Aife.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.088
Swallow.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.522
Swallow that.

03:26.916 --> 03:31.330
[breathes heavily]

03:33.130 --> 03:34.870
[gaSPS]

03:37.134 --> 03:40.092
You don't wanna do that.

03:40.304 --> 03:50.100
[alarm blaring]

03:50.314 --> 04:00.315
[alarm continues]

04:11.085 --> 04:16.079
[opening theme]

04:17.967 --> 04:19.707
[30}
Why didn't you tell me?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.043
I saw Taft kill her.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.675
She died saving me.
And you knew she was alive?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.882
Please sit down and
we can talk about this.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.813
I saw her.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.309
What? Where?

04:38.529 --> 04:40.611
[TRICK] When you were
on the Wanderer's train.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.814
Aife was sane.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.196
And even though her memory
of you had been wiped,

04:46.412 --> 04:49.245
[TRICK] deep down she
knew she had a daughter.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.368
She came looking for you.

04:51.584 --> 04:52.915
What happened?

04:53.127 --> 04:57.496
[TRICK] Once she regained
her memory, she...

04:57.715 --> 05:00.582
She went crazy again.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.677
I remind her of the darkest
period in her life.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.470
Why wouldn't I
make her crazy?

05:06.682 --> 05:08.638
[TRICK] She was in
a Fae institution

05:08.851 --> 05:12.764
for the mentally ill.
She escaped last night.

05:14.106 --> 05:14.811
[TRICK]
Where are you going?

05:15.024 --> 05:16.560
To find my mom,
make sure she's safe.

05:16.775 --> 05:17.605
Bo--

05:17.818 --> 05:20.025
One Of US DGGdS to care.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.440
[crying]

05:26.118 --> 05:27.528
[TAMSIN sighs]

05:31.540 --> 05:39.709
[breathes rapidly]

05:40.299 --> 05:41.334
[30}
Not only Trick...

05:41.550 --> 05:42.505
You, Kenzi?

05:42.718 --> 05:44.333
You all knew she was alive?

05:44.553 --> 05:47.169
[DYSON] I wanted to tell you.
It wasn't my call to make.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.220
[BO] Yeah well,
lying by omission got old

05:49.433 --> 05:51.139
a long time ago.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.762
[DYSON] After the train,
you were suffering from

05:52.978 --> 05:55.310
memory loss. Trauma.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.354
And the longer we waited,
the harder it became.

05:57.566 --> 06:02.151
[BO] Oh, well. Sorry it
was so hard on you.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.652
[DYSON] Bo. I admit,
we made the wrong choice.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.243
But we made it
'cause we love you.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.033
That's what family does.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.955
I can't imagine how
awful it must have been.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.954
If I were her,
I would've escaped too.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.508
[NURSE] Take a look around.
You won't find much.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.176
You mind if we
question her?

06:28.389 --> 06:29.299
Be my guest.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.302
But Estelle hasn't
talked in 300 years.

06:32.518 --> 06:33.678
What happened?

06:33.894 --> 06:38.479
Her family was murdered.
She shut down to survive.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.415
Estelle? I'm looking
for my mother.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.842
[30}
And I need your help.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.931
I hope you don't mind...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.202
Hi.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.076
I'm Bo.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.704
I recognize you.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.750
How?

07:59.605 --> 08:02.221
Tell me something.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.854
If the thought of me
drove my mother crazy,

08:06.070 --> 08:08.106
why did she keep
me above her bed?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.358
I don't know.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.735
Do you know why she escaped?

08:14.370 --> 08:17.453
The doctors talk, I hear them.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.075
[ESTELLE] They said
she was doing well.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.406
They were
going to release her.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.036
Why didn't they?

08:23.545 --> 08:26.753
One day...
something happened.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.581
[ESTELLE] I could
see it in her eyes.

08:29.802 --> 08:34.171
You can tell everything
form a person's eyes.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.176
The window to the soul.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.684
You have beautiful
eyes, Estelle.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.106
Do you know what
triggered the change?

08:47.653 --> 08:51.441
Whatever it was,
it was frightening.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.148
[ESTELLE] As if everything
that was once wrong

08:54.368 --> 08:57.155
came rushing back.

08:57.371 --> 09:03.241
All... at... once.

09:21.437 --> 09:23.393
Okay...

09:25.190 --> 09:27.567
Thank you, for your help.

09:37.661 --> 09:40.528
Something triggered Aife,
we need to find out what.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.285
Miss, we're gonna need access
to all of Aife's records.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.456
[NURSE] I'll send you
everything we have right away.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.705
[DYSON] Thank you.
[phone ringing]

09:47.921 --> 09:48.785
[phone ringing]

09:49.006 --> 09:49.586
[phone beeps]

09:49.798 --> 09:51.538
Lauren.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.592
[LAUREN]
I called as soon as I saw.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.509
I don't even know
how long it's been.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.883
Or how many times he
escaped without us knowing.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.590
Oh, he left me
a note thanking me

10:01.810 --> 10:05.428
for my hospitality,
and this.

10:08.901 --> 10:09.765
[30}
A portrait?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.350
So now my father's
an artist?

10:11.570 --> 10:12.605
He's insane.

10:12.821 --> 10:16.029
First Aife escapes,
now Jack.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.903
What if he had
something to do with it?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.914
We have to find him.
If he wants a dark army,

10:23.123 --> 10:24.909
[BO] his first stop might
be the backdoor to Hell.

10:25.125 --> 10:25.705
The cinvat.

10:25.918 --> 10:28.204
I'll go, make sure he
doesn't try to reopen it.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.536
You stay here in case
he comes back?

10:30.756 --> 10:32.587
[LAUREN]
What about you?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.792
I'm gonna check the only
residence fit for an Ancient.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.193
My god you're gorgeous.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.162
Mom?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.363
Of course you are,
you take after me...

11:05.582 --> 11:07.413
...mostly.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.251
Let's go. Now.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.085
Where?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.546
You're just in time for dinner.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.001
I'm preparing her favorite.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.549
What the hell's going on here?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.672
Hard to believe, I know.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.555
Oh, Bo. Aren't you happy?

11:24.768 --> 11:27.009
Your mom and dad
are back together.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.399
[JACK] Any special
requests, darling?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.988
I know you've
always loved Bach.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.607
I don't want music.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.689
I wanna know what my mother,
who I thought was dead,

11:40.909 --> 11:42.410
is doing here with
the man who tortured her

11:43.954 --> 11:47.788
Noted, noted, and noted.
But I was asking your mother.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.116
Aife, baby, requests?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.370
[AIFE]
Bach sounds delightful.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.326
--[JACK] 'Kay.
--[AIFE] As long as it's

11:52.546 --> 11:53.626
followed by Sir Mix-A-Lot.

11:53.839 --> 11:54.669
[JACK] M hm!

11:54.882 --> 11:55.917
Mama loves her
"Baby Got Back,"

11:56.133 --> 11:57.213
and I know
Bo does too. Right?

11:57.426 --> 11:58.541
Come on, we gotta
get you out of here.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.342
Will you relax?
I want to be here.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.342
[classical music plays]

12:04.558 --> 12:05.843
What did you do to her?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.391
Care to explain to her
what I've done to you?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.344
Yes. He's kindly
made me dinner.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.306
Oh, and since you're here,
you should join us.

12:13.525 --> 12:17.017
[JACK] A family that eats
together, stays together.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.614
Yeah. Well. We've never
really been "together,"

12:19.823 --> 12:21.734
so that's pretty much
null and void.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.815
You know, the last
time you and I spoke,

12:24.036 --> 12:26.118
we agreed to--
[clears throat]

12:26.330 --> 12:27.991
stay clear of one another.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.118
I don't recall
inviting you, Bo.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.917
Too bad, I crash.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.370
And I'm not leaving
until you free her.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.956
She's free to go
when she wishes.

12:39.176 --> 12:39.961
Holding her against her will

12:40.177 --> 12:41.713
sounds more like
your grandfather.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.760
You leave Trick out of this.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.884
[AIFE] Jack saved me
from the Dark Dungeons.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.803
Told ya.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.556
[AIFE] Just like
he's saving me now.

12:51.772 --> 12:52.887
From what exactly?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.562
The institution.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.640
[BO] Yes. Trick knew
you were in there, but--

12:56.860 --> 12:59.192
Knew? [laughs]

12:59.404 --> 13:03.568
Honey, your grandfather is
the one that had me committed.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.775
Dinner is served.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.491
[LAUREN] I don't know
how I didn't notice

13:10.707 --> 13:11.913
Jack escaping from the cell.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.831
Tamsin, if anything happens...

13:14.044 --> 13:15.705
It's okay, you're only human,

13:15.921 --> 13:17.081
you couldn't have
done anything anyway.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.673
Yes, I'm a human.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.498
We all get it. Thank you.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.095
Still recovering from
your god swap with Zee?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.680
Oh, what's to recover
from, the guilt?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.504
Humiliation of almost
getting myself killed?

13:27.724 --> 13:28.554
No big deal.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.428
[TAMSIN]
It all worked out in the end.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.180
Sort of.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.562
What?

13:36.775 --> 13:38.891
[LAUREN] No, nothing. I don't
wanna get into this with you.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.693
You already started.
You may as well finish.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.773
Did she say anything to you?

13:45.993 --> 13:51.033
No, a-about y-your breakup?
No. No.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.489
Okay, I just don't want Bo
to feel alone right now.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.075
[LAUREN] Not with
everything that's going on.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.786
Did you have the chance
to spend any time with her?

14:00.007 --> 14:03.499
No... no, not really.

14:09.766 --> 14:14.886
Tamsin, you're molting.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.891
Don't worry about that.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.893
Too late.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.599
Why is your hair falling out?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.355
I don't know.

14:22.571 --> 14:26.109
Well... has anything like
this happened before?

14:26.324 --> 14:28.861
Uh... In past lives,
when I was about to die.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.692
It would fall out
when I Doubted.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.949
As a sign I was
about to expire...

14:34.166 --> 14:35.781
You're dying?

14:36.168 --> 14:41.834
Yeah. Yeah, y'know. With no
legacy, not a big deal.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.539
[LAUREN] But you're just
a young Valkyrie.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.465
[TAMSIN] I know but maybe
every time I Doubted

14:45.677 --> 14:47.918
Freyja and Acacia,
I wore myself thin.

14:48.138 --> 14:48.968
[LAUREN]
No, you know what?

14:49.181 --> 14:50.512
There's no need
to self diagnose,

14:50.724 --> 14:52.464
I will do a full work-up.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.970
Oh yeah! 'Cause that's
how I wanna spend

14:55.187 --> 14:56.802
my last few precious moments.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.853
[TAMSIN]
In this clinic. With you.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.274
Have you eaten anything
unusual in the last 24 hours?

15:02.486 --> 15:05.398
Ummm. Cheezies from
Bo's vending machine.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.320
Ugh! They've been there for years.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.362
I know.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.655
[LAUREN]
What about new products?

15:09.868 --> 15:14.077
Any... sort of beauty
cream...? Night masks?

15:14.289 --> 15:16.621
I don't night mask.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.825
Right. Of course.

15:20.045 --> 15:24.835
You just wake up like that,
naturally flawless.

15:25.050 --> 15:29.589
In terms of your sexual
history, anything recent?

15:30.847 --> 15:34.135
Um... you know what, I really
think it's this new shampoo

15:34.351 --> 15:36.091
that I'm using...

15:36.311 --> 15:38.427
I'm gonna get a drink.
At The Dal.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.478
Good. Yeah.
I'll come with you.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.726
It will give us a chance
to go over more symptoms.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.808
Yeah...

15:47.155 --> 15:48.486
Sea urchin.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.278
Mm!

15:49.491 --> 15:51.982
Used as model organisms
in developmental biology

15:52.202 --> 15:54.739
since the 1800s.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.030
Artificial spawning.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.366
Feels like the ocean
just spawned in my mouth.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.836
[AIFE and JACK laugh]

16:02.045 --> 16:03.876
[AIFE]
Bo, you have to try.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.295
I'm good.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.498
[JACK] Saving your appetite
for the main course?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.924
You'll be glad you did.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.719
Christian, Victoria.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.471
I'm not hungry.

16:18.687 --> 16:22.350
It's not polite to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.479
You're nobody's gift.
You're free to go.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.061
We serve Jack
because we want to.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.021
It's an honor.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.321
[VICTORIA]
Aren't you grateful?

16:32.534 --> 16:34.900
Ah! More for Mommy.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.034
That's enough.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.126
Mom! You're gonna kill her.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.047
Great, great.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.969
[AIFE sighs]

16:55.182 --> 16:57.343
[JACK]
Important question.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.972
Have I ever lied to you?

17:01.188 --> 17:07.935
Maybe, maybe not. I do
know you've been creative.

17:08.153 --> 17:11.316
Creative. Hm. How so?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.193
You left your cell
without telling me.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.444
I thought we
agreed I was gonna

17:15.660 --> 17:17.867
give you a little space, huh?

17:18.079 --> 17:21.617
And you said so yourself--
that box couldn't hold me.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.869
[AIFE] Bo, has he ever
lied to you about anything

17:24.085 --> 17:26.667
that truly matters? The past?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.666
Think about it.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.672
Not that I know of, no.

17:34.888 --> 17:38.472
Can you say the
same about Trick?

17:40.060 --> 17:44.053
It's time we
told her the truth.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.103
[sighs]

17:47.192 --> 17:49.183
Where do I start?

17:53.156 --> 17:55.192
The beginning.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.785
[AIFE]
The Great War.

17:57.994 --> 18:02.033
My father, your grandfather,

18:02.249 --> 18:06.117
wrote a truce in his blood
between the Light and the Dark.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.543
And me, always the rebel,
I refused to choose.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.962
Like mother, like daughter.

18:11.174 --> 18:14.962
[AIFE] My mother, Isabeau,
died during that war.

18:15.178 --> 18:19.012
And I avenged her death
by killing a Dark Fae elder.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.681
I went to Trick
for protection.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.885
[AIFE]
But to maintain order,

18:25.105 --> 18:29.018
he gave me over to
the Dark for execution.

18:29.234 --> 18:30.098
[AIFE]
And instead of killing me,

18:30.318 --> 18:32.183
they kept me as their prisoner.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.781
Unspeakable.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.485
But then Trick found
out you were alive,

18:41.705 --> 18:42.660
[BC]
and he tried to save you.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.659
Oh no, he didn't.

18:45.875 --> 18:50.289
And I lost my mind.
Quite literally, Bo.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.496
I went mad.

18:54.676 --> 19:00.637
[AIFE] And then,
Jack found me,

19:00.849 --> 19:01.964
[AIFE] and he saved me.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.764
You mean he took
advantage of you.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.558
[AIFE] No.

19:05.770 --> 19:10.514
No, he loved me.
And I loved him.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.567
[AIFE] Honey...

19:18.241 --> 19:21.699
You were born of love.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.903
I was in Tartarus. I saw
that he kept you in a cage.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.283
[AIFE] And I'm glad he did.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.081
That was to
protect you from me.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.376
I had PTSD and
in my darker times,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.374
I threatened to kill you.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.957
[JACK] A consequence of
being kept in the dark.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.667
[AIFE huffs]

19:40.972 --> 19:43.964
We never wanted
to send you away.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.140
But Jack thought
it was for the best.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.186
[AIFE] With me unwell, and your
father bound to Tartarus--

19:49.397 --> 19:51.103
Trick found you first.

19:51.316 --> 19:55.901
And all he did
was feed you lies.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.650
So did you, the first
time that we met.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.151
You called yourself unaligned,

20:01.368 --> 20:03.279
but you were clearly
with the Light.

20:03.495 --> 20:06.032
I didn't know if I
could open up to you.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.908
[AIFE]
It wasn't easy for me.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.452
[JACK] Bo. Your mother
understands struggle.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.083
I understand struggle.

20:16.299 --> 20:22.295
[JACK] And like you,
we crave justice.

20:22.514 --> 20:29.977
It is time for us to rise,
together, as a family.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.740
Don't bother scheduling
a family portrait.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.533
Bo, you deserve
to know the truth!

20:45.745 --> 20:46.860
Bo!

20:47.080 --> 20:49.196
I need to go,
I need to think.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.078
Consider one thing.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.669
[JACK]
Perhaps all this time,

20:53.878 --> 20:56.585
you've chosen the
wrong side of the family.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.523
[car door opens]

21:27.120 --> 21:28.109
What are you doing?

21:28.329 --> 21:30.536
[AIFE]
What are you doing? Ugh!

21:30.748 --> 21:33.364
You are off your game,
younglady.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.200
What game?

21:35.420 --> 21:39.504
We're sending your father
back where he belongs.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.547
Hell.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.929
I-wanna-be-your-
hell-bride red?

21:52.145 --> 21:55.603
Or... belle-of-the-
underworld-ball black?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.555
[BO] How about a pair of
sweat pants so you can relax

21:57.775 --> 21:59.606
and tell me why you're
playing dress up?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.684
[AIFE] Seduction takes
the perfect outfit.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.271
And tonight is the
ultimate conquest.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.698
Mother and daughter,
working together.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.242
So everything you said
at dinner was a lie?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.490
No. It was all true.

22:11.706 --> 22:14.288
[AIFE]
I loved your father.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.207
He's the ultimate bad boy.

22:16.419 --> 22:21.038
Handsome. Charming.
A cunning linguist.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.624
Then why do you wanna
send him back to Hell?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.960
'Cause I thought there
was some good in him.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.545
Deep down...

22:29.349 --> 22:31.556
I was wrong.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.509
What did he do to you?

22:36.105 --> 22:39.848
See, that's the thing,
it wasn't me.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.979
It was all about you.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.486
Oh, mom.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.859
[laughs]
Oh, come on, Bo.

22:48.076 --> 22:50.317
Haven't you ever fallen
for the wrong guy?

23:00.088 --> 23:01.248
[DYSON] Hey.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.329
Hey!

23:03.550 --> 23:06.257
I didn't know
who else to call.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.005
How is she?

23:08.221 --> 23:09.927
Well, she went from
eating his sea urchin

23:10.139 --> 23:11.800
to wanting to
destroy him, so...

23:12.016 --> 23:13.392
up and down, I would say.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.466
And how are you?

23:15.687 --> 23:17.223
Confused.

23:20.608 --> 23:25.352
Dyson, tell me, would this
outfit work to seduce you?

23:25.572 --> 23:26.482
[laughs]

23:26.698 --> 23:29.280
Wait, wouldn't be
the first time.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.278
[AIFE laughs]

23:31.494 --> 23:32.654
What's your plan, Aife?

23:32.870 --> 23:35.156
Ask Bo. She came up with it.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.204
Mom, what are you
talking about?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.953
[AIFE laughs]

23:39.168 --> 23:40.999
Don't mess with me.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.076
I'm not.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.913
[AIFE]
Just... stop. Okay?

23:45.133 --> 23:47.419
[BO] Mom, whatever you are
planning, it's dangerous.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.796
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

23:50.013 --> 23:53.005
But we... we came up
with the plan together.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.430
What are you talking about?

23:56.102 --> 23:58.013
--[BO] Where?!
--[A|FE] At the...

23:58.229 --> 23:59.844
institution.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.018
I didn't even know
you were in there.

24:03.234 --> 24:09.104
Yes, yes you did.
Yes you did! Because...

24:09.324 --> 24:11.485
...Trick told you that
I was doing better,

24:11.701 --> 24:13.111
so then you came to me.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.239
And then... and then
you told me your plan!

24:15.455 --> 24:16.695
Mom, I never visited you.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.529
Stop saying that!

24:20.251 --> 24:20.831
--[BO] Mom...
--[AIFE] Stop!

24:21.044 --> 24:24.081
Stop, stop! Stop!

24:26.758 --> 24:31.843
You... you tricked me.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.512
This was his plan,
you've joined him.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.214
You're on his side!

24:36.434 --> 24:37.970
[AIFE] Oh no.
This is all happening,

24:38.186 --> 24:39.221
this is happening.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.803
And, and, it's what he wanted.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.014
No, Mom... listen.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.439
This isn't real! [laughs]

24:48.655 --> 24:50.816
You're not real!

24:51.032 --> 24:52.067
Mom, what are you doing?

24:52.283 --> 24:55.275
[AIFE] What I should have
done a long time ago.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.874
It's true.
I do make you crazy.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.881
No...

25:10.093 --> 25:12.379
Bo...

25:17.850 --> 25:19.386
How's your beer?

25:19.602 --> 25:21.388
It's beer.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.890
Mine's quite hoppy, actually.

25:24.107 --> 25:29.101
I'd guess about 50 IBUs,
which is my max.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.776
Is nothing sacred?

25:30.988 --> 25:31.852
[LAUREN] What?

25:32.073 --> 25:33.062
Don't do that!

25:33.282 --> 25:36.490
It's cold, it's refreshing,
it's not... science.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.568
I don't think
everything's science.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.369
Name one thing.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.459
Well, my relationships,
for one thing.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.457
Although, I do
believe in chemistry.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.254
Even though we had
our differences,

25:50.466 --> 25:54.459
that was... that was one area
that was no problem with Bo.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.512
This is totally weird talking
to you about this, isn't it?

25:57.724 --> 26:00.761
Mm, just a little, yeah.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.092
[sighs]

26:02.311 --> 26:04.597
If you must...

26:04.814 --> 26:06.350
Can you be honest with me?

26:06.566 --> 26:08.102
Okay.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.358
[LAUREN] Do you think
that I made a mistake?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.186
I wanted to be Fae for us,

26:13.406 --> 26:14.691
so that we could
be together forever.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.320
Is that... is that so wrong?

26:19.454 --> 26:23.788
No. I get it.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.367
I made a really bad deal
for seven extra lives.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.919
Thanks. For being real.

26:30.131 --> 26:34.374
That's the one thing I can
always count on you for.

26:35.678 --> 26:38.670
We slept together
the night you broke up.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.097
[TAMSIN] I... I feel
guilty for not telling you.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.674
Which is crazy,

26:42.894 --> 26:45.510
because I normally don't
care what you think.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.641
[TAMSIN] But if I'm dying,

26:47.857 --> 26:51.600
I'd like to do it with
a clear conscience.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.606
And I think the guilt's
making me lose my hair.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.284
I don't care.

26:59.494 --> 27:00.609
Yeah, I didn't
think you would.

27:00.828 --> 27:05.322
[LAUREN]
No, I mean about you and...

27:05.541 --> 27:08.328
I don't have the right or the
desire to control her actions.

27:08.544 --> 27:13.413
She's free to do
as she pleases.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.591
The high road.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.670
Can't you just punch me in the
face like a normal person?

27:19.889 --> 27:22.972
When have I
ever been normal?

27:23.184 --> 27:25.971
Speaking of Bo,
has she texted yet?

27:26.187 --> 27:29.475
Nope. Thought she'd
be here by now.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.775
[TRICK sighs]

27:40.117 --> 27:43.701
[30}
You kept me in the dark.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.199
I found Aife.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.700
Is she okay?

27:47.917 --> 27:49.578
I had to put her back
in the institution

27:49.794 --> 27:52.661
because what you
did broke her.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.836
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

27:55.049 --> 27:58.758
I know why you didn't
tell me what happened.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.382
Because you're guilty.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.180
You are not a good father.

28:07.562 --> 28:10.554
You're right, I'm not.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.638
But I tried
the best I knew how.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.690
[BC]
The best that you knew how?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.314
When Aife was a
problem to your rules,

28:17.530 --> 28:19.816
you put her in
the Dark Dungeons.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.569
[BO] You drove her crazy.

28:22.785 --> 28:27.495
And when she needed you,
more than anything,

28:27.707 --> 28:29.493
you locked her in
an institution.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.621
Because that's how you solve
problems, you lock them away.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.874
And the worst part
of all of this?

28:38.426 --> 28:42.385
You kept my mother from me.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.506
Do you want to
drive me crazy too?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.762
Of course not.
Bo, please.

28:48.978 --> 28:51.640
[BO] Keeping me in the
dark does not protect me--

28:51.856 --> 28:54.973
it makes me want to scream.

28:56.277 --> 28:59.394
I don't know who to believe,
I don't know what to believe.

28:59.614 --> 29:02.105
Jack told me that he saved
her from the Dark Dungeons,

29:02.325 --> 29:04.190
[BO] that he tried to
save her from insanity.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.447
He did not save her
from her illness,

29:07.663 --> 29:08.823
he took advantage of it!

29:09.040 --> 29:10.200
That is what you
wanted me to believe.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.781
Think, Bo!

29:12.001 --> 29:12.956
[TRICK]
Her strength and powers,

29:13.169 --> 29:15.160
combined with my blood.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.587
The perfect, fertile ground
for what he wanted to create.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.414
You!

29:21.969 --> 29:26.963
There was no saving, only the
intention to create and use.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.516
You want to talk about using?

29:30.728 --> 29:33.640
You used Aife to make
a point of your rules.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.689
You are no better than him.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.734
I'm not perfect,
I've destroyed lives.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.857
Cursed noble warriors.

29:42.073 --> 29:43.279
Torn families apart.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.654
Including my very own.

29:46.869 --> 29:50.737
[TRICK] And if I'd told you
all that when I met you,

29:50.957 --> 29:52.493
you never would have
let me into your life.

29:52.708 --> 29:57.168
You're right.
And I wish I never had.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.127
[TRICK] When someone
recounts the past

30:06.347 --> 30:09.680
it becomes a
narrative, a story.

30:09.892 --> 30:14.807
I have mine, your mother
has hers, and he has his.

30:15.022 --> 30:20.107
[TRICK] And now you,
Bo Dennis, need yours.

30:20.319 --> 30:24.528
And for it to be true, you need
to draw your own conclusions--

30:24.740 --> 30:27.527
[TRICK]
find your own truth.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.779
These are Aife's files
from the institution

30:29.996 --> 30:34.330
and everything that
I've had from her past.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.454
[TRICK] Medical records,
tapes; it's all in here.

30:37.670 --> 30:43.961
It's time. Nothing is
kept from you anymore.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.620
[TASMIN]
What's all this?

31:14.832 --> 31:16.038
Answers, I hope.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.787
Wanna help?

31:19.003 --> 31:24.168
[projector rolling]

31:24.383 --> 31:26.999
[AIFE]
There's evil inside her.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.586
I should have killed her
when I had the chance.

31:32.808 --> 31:36.096
You have to let me out.

31:36.312 --> 31:39.099
I have to kill her.

31:39.315 --> 31:40.555
I have to kill Bo.

31:40.775 --> 31:48.819
[AIFE growls]
[MAN screaming]

31:50.993 --> 31:53.325
She didn't mean it,
Bo. She's not well.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.368
I know.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.164
[LAUREN] Hey...

32:00.127 --> 32:02.083
Visitations.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.805
He didn't just let her rot.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.266
Looks like he
took care of her.

32:25.486 --> 32:26.976
And her response
is positive.

32:27.196 --> 32:28.982
Calm.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.865
There's another visitor.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.830
I thought you said that you
didn't know she was there?

32:44.046 --> 32:44.876
I didn't.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.420
Is it possible someone
wiped your memory?

32:46.632 --> 32:47.917
No, I think that
I would remember

32:48.134 --> 32:50.250
visiting my own mother!

32:50.469 --> 32:53.006
Who could have
orchestrated this?

32:54.849 --> 32:58.057
Zee said that Jack's
evil takes many forms.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.385
She didn't say what they were.

33:00.604 --> 33:01.980
Jack wasn't just
escaping from his cell.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.475
No, he was impersonating me.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.018
[BO]
Dyson, it's Bo.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.648
We need to get Jack now.

33:10.865 --> 33:13.106
I'll fill you in on the way.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.902
That's why Aife thought
we made a plan together.

33:18.122 --> 33:21.239
She's not crazy,
she was tricked.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.870
We need to get him.

33:24.086 --> 33:28.420
[LAUREN] Yeah. Before he
does this to somebody else.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.884
Tamsin, let's go.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.629
The other night, um...

33:33.679 --> 33:39.345
You, uh...
You were with me...

33:45.316 --> 33:47.557
VVhen?

33:54.074 --> 33:56.941
The night you and
Lauren broke up.

33:57.161 --> 34:00.119
Oh, Tamsin.

34:01.290 --> 34:06.580
[retching]

34:06.795 --> 34:10.788
[TAMSIN coughing]

34:28.484 --> 34:32.102
Tamsin, he's not gonna
get away with this.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.983
Please don't touch me.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.190
Do you wanna talk about it?

34:39.912 --> 34:42.278
I'm gonna kill him.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.204
I'm gonna rip him
into a million pieces

34:44.416 --> 34:46.702
and I'm gonna
feed him to dogs.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.080
[JACK cackling]

34:53.300 --> 34:57.088
Impressive entrance. Yeah.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.545
I like the formation.

35:06.855 --> 35:10.097
[JACK chuckles]
[TAMSIN breathes heavily]

35:10.317 --> 35:11.102
You done?

35:11.318 --> 35:13.104
Not even close.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.193
That wasn't very nice.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.331
And they all... fall...

35:28.544 --> 35:29.954
[DYSON growls]

35:31.922 --> 35:34.163
[DYSON yells, grunts]

35:36.802 --> 35:37.791
Are you regretting it?

35:38.012 --> 35:39.092
[g rowls]

35:39.305 --> 35:40.670
You said you would, before we--

35:40.889 --> 35:41.753
Don't you dare.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.010
Don't you even look at her,
you pathetic, worthless coward.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.842
Not a fan of my
old trick, I see?

35:47.062 --> 35:49.223
I learned it from
my brother Zeus.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.647
He impersonated
the King Amphitryon

35:51.859 --> 35:55.602
[JACK] to sleep with
Alcmene. The catch--

35:55.821 --> 35:59.029
I can only impersonate
those I share blood with.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.992
Speaking of blood.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.574
[BO] No! No. We need
to get him to Lauren.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.405
And I'm not leaving you
here alone. Let's go.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.831
We aren't finished!

36:10.044 --> 36:10.829
[TASMIN] Come on.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.956
[DYSON grunts]

36:18.886 --> 36:21.423
See you soon.

36:28.187 --> 36:29.097
How's he doing?

36:29.313 --> 36:31.554
I've staunched the bleeding.
He'll be fine.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.230
I'm more worried
about you, Tamsin.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.602
I'll live.

36:34.818 --> 36:35.568
I think.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.018
What is happening to you?

36:37.237 --> 36:38.898
I don't know.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.200
[LAUREN]
Bo, what are you doing?

36:44.411 --> 36:47.949
I don't wanna be part
of that ever again.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.425
Ouch.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.192
Bo, he's weak!

37:16.402 --> 37:18.518
Let her.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.278
I'm sorry.

37:25.494 --> 37:26.279
Don't be.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.280
Did it work?

37:27.496 --> 37:28.201
[BO] It better have.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.119
Now we kill him.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.195
No, I need to see Trick.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.327
I made a terrible mistake,
I have to talk to him.

37:32.543 --> 37:33.123
We're coming with you.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.450
[30}
No, this is between us.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.457
Stay together,
no one travels alone.

37:46.890 --> 37:47.800
Aife.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.005
[AIFE] Leave...

37:49.226 --> 37:52.218
Not without you.
We have to hurry.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.144
Quick, before he comes.

37:54.356 --> 37:58.144
[AIFE]
It's over. He won.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.476
Since when do you give up?

38:00.696 --> 38:02.482
You're a fighter.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.108
You've always been a fighter.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.575
My little fighter.

38:05.784 --> 38:09.242
And you've always
hated that about me.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.867
I failed you.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.745
[AIFE]
You saved her.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.045
You saved Bo.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.216
And one day,
she will know. But she...

38:24.428 --> 38:27.215
[AIFE] She has to
find out for herself.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.894
[AIFE gasps]

38:35.981 --> 38:37.937
Father-in-law.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.981
What a pleasure.

38:40.194 --> 38:42.810
I'm taking my daughter home.

38:44.490 --> 38:47.232
This ends tonight.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.863
Yes it does.

38:53.749 --> 38:55.990
[BO]
Trick, you were right.

39:04.635 --> 39:06.125
[projector rolling]

39:06.345 --> 39:11.180
[AIFE]
Alone... all alone...

39:11.391 --> 39:14.007
There's so much noise...

39:14.228 --> 39:19.973
Daddy. Please don't
leave, daddy.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.404
Please don't leave me alone.

39:27.616 --> 39:30.858
[AIFE] Daddy you--
please don't leave me.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.586
Dyson, Aife wasn't
at the institution.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.584
I'm checking the penthouse.

39:47.219 --> 39:57.220

40:28.635 --> 40:30.876

40:31.096 --> 40:32.632

[TRICK groans]

40:53.744 --> 40:55.985
[exhales deeply]

40:56.204 --> 40:58.115
This is my fault.

40:58.332 --> 41:01.574
[BO] I brought him here,
I let him in.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.954
I'm gonna go get help.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.587
Stay with me.

41:09.760 --> 41:14.094
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

41:15.599 --> 41:20.684

My granddaughter.

41:25.734 --> 41:33.231
Always remember,
you are my blood too.

[classical music intensifies]

41:54.388 --> 42:04.389
[BO sobbing]

42:11.279 --> 42:12.405
[LAUREN] Hey.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.479
There's one more
test I wanna run.

42:17.244 --> 42:19.075
I don't see anything.
Can we stop?

42:19.287 --> 42:23.621
[LAUREN] Not yet.
Just a few more seconds.

42:23.834 --> 42:27.747
[heartbeat sounding quietly]

42:27.963 --> 42:29.669
Is that...?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.917
It's a heartbeat.

42:32.134 --> 42:37.800
[heartbeat continues]

42:38.014 --> 42:50.063
[TAMSIN breathes rapidly]

42:51.820 --> 42:53.230
[DYSON] Bo!

43:06.585 --> 43:08.826
[roars]

43:09.045 --> 43:11.457
Where is he?

43:15.552 --> 43:17.634
[DYSON]
We have to get out of here.

43:17.846 --> 43:18.961
Bo, come on.

43:23.477 --> 43:25.013
Bo?
