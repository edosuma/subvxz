<i>Previously, on</i>
"Batwoman"...

00:03.259 --> 00:07.071
To Catherine, a most
extraordinary woman.

00:07.289 --> 00:09.141
You should have
first looked

00:09.229 --> 00:11.559
to see whether it's
marked poison or not.

00:11.646 --> 00:12.918
Jacob would never
hurt us.

00:13.005 --> 00:14.283
You know she died?

00:14.370 --> 00:16.772
Exactly the way that
Alice planned it.

00:16.860 --> 00:17.874
Hands in the air, Kane.

00:17.962 --> 00:19.531
- You're under arrest.
- What the hell is happening?

00:19.618 --> 00:20.961
Get your hands off of me!

00:21.048 --> 00:22.811
You had someone
impersonate him,

00:22.899 --> 00:25.476
- the skin pirate.
- I'm gonna ask you again, Kate.

00:25.563 --> 00:27.055
Is Alice worth it?

What the hell?
That's my stop.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.452
He missed my stop
completely.

00:52.540 --> 00:55.030
Hey, Keanu.
Some of us have tickets

00:55.118 --> 00:56.516
to "Jagged Little Pill".

01:02.524 --> 01:03.694
That's not right.

01:03.782 --> 01:05.119
<i>Attention,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:05.206 --> 01:07.318
<i>It appears our computer system
has stopped responding.</i>

01:07.405 --> 01:08.678
<i>We've lost our brakes.</i>

01:08.766 --> 01:10.905
<i>This is not a drill.
Brace for impact.</i>

01:10.993 --> 01:13.438
Conductor sent GCPD
an SOS 5 minutes ago

01:13.525 --> 01:14.716
that his brakes went out.

01:14.803 --> 01:17.069
Now at his rate of speed
and taking into consideration

01:17.157 --> 01:20.384
the rush hour passenger weight
on a 650-volt, 3-rail system,

01:20.555 --> 01:22.264
they've got about half a mile
of track

01:22.352 --> 01:24.435
before they get
to the end of the line.

01:24.915 --> 01:26.242
You didn't hear a word
I just said, did you?

01:26.329 --> 01:27.970
I love this bike!

01:28.967 --> 01:31.389
Figured you couldn't exactly
have the same ride as Kate Kane.

01:31.477 --> 01:33.496
Agreed, but it's not my
birthday for two days.

01:33.584 --> 01:34.979
Birthday?

01:35.066 --> 01:36.514
You had no idea.

01:36.841 --> 01:38.410
Uh, yeah. So the next

<i>After the death
of Oliver Queen,</i>

02:42.851 --> 02:45.209
<i>I think we all needed
a reason to smile,</i>

02:45.297 --> 02:47.418

<i>Are we shipping these two

02:56.968 --> 02:58.060
Congrats.

02:58.148 --> 02:59.824
Your street cred's off
the charts right now.

02:59.911 --> 03:03.605
Officer Slam Bradley
is as hometown hero as it gets.

03:03.693 --> 03:05.519
Why is this guy suddenly
everywhere that I am?

03:05.607 --> 03:07.620
The GCPD's probably
stepping up their game now

03:07.708 --> 03:09.524
that the head
of the Crows is in jail.

03:11.773 --> 03:15.964
Oh. Heh.
Slam is Mr. March

03:16.052 --> 03:18.848
in the annual hunks
of the GCPD calendar.

03:18.935 --> 03:20.374
The handcuffs are
a nice touch.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.292
I got to say
I can't really blame people

03:22.380 --> 03:23.935
for shipping you
and Captain America.

03:24.022 --> 03:26.115
Have we not had
this conversation?

03:26.654 --> 03:28.027
I'm very, very gay.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.482
Have you not seen
Batwoman?

03:29.608 --> 03:31.240
Major straight vibes.

03:32.419 --> 03:34.004
Kate, it's not
a total negative.

03:34.091 --> 03:35.769
That I'm apparently
dating Mr. Underwear

03:35.857 --> 03:36.998
that leaves nothing to the imagination?

03:37.085 --> 03:38.911
That Gotham's confused.

03:39.630 --> 03:41.512
It's misinformation.
The less they know about you,

03:41.599 --> 03:43.279
the easier it is to keep
you a secret.

03:43.842 --> 03:45.490
A train lost its brakes,

03:45.607 --> 03:47.527
and I saved 450 people
from smashing

03:47.615 --> 03:48.852
into a concrete wall,

03:48.939 --> 03:50.615
and all Gotham
cares about

03:50.850 --> 03:52.575
is Batwoman's sex life.

03:52.663 --> 03:53.923
They just want
to see her happy.

03:54.011 --> 03:56.099
Well, too bad because
she's not.

04:08.191 --> 04:10.216
"Fill up your glasses
a quick as you can

04:10.304 --> 04:11.720
and sprinkle
the table

04:11.808 --> 04:13.307
with buttons
and bran.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.676
Cats in the coffee
and mice in the tea,

04:17.091 --> 04:21.170
and welcome Queen Alice
with 30 times 3".

04:21.411 --> 04:23.880
Oh, Catherine,
do tell me

04:23.997 --> 04:25.427
if it's too weak.

04:27.607 --> 04:28.902
What's that, dear?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.740
Too bitter. Then it's perfect.

04:32.036 --> 04:33.708
Now back to sleep.

04:34.161 --> 04:35.700
Nighty night.

04:36.622 --> 04:38.269
Such a shame
our dear sister

04:38.357 --> 04:39.810
couldn't join us today.

04:40.035 --> 04:43.743
Guess that would require
her taking one of your calls

04:44.497 --> 04:46.169
or answering a text...

04:46.784 --> 04:48.013
or a letter

04:48.271 --> 04:49.409
or a cryptic gift.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.902
Oh, shh!
Your tea's getting cold.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.728
I'm getting cold.

04:54.357 --> 04:56.855
Perhaps we should resume
this when the conditions

04:56.943 --> 04:59.301
are more favorable
to celebration.

05:00.060 --> 05:03.075
Catherine Hamilton
is dead.

05:03.247 --> 05:05.540
The sunshine is implied.

05:06.013 --> 05:08.482
Look, Alice.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.995
I know you have this fantasy

05:11.083 --> 05:14.599
that the 3 of us are going
to be a family one day,

05:14.849 --> 05:16.529
but Kate doesn't.

05:17.288 --> 05:21.865
I killed
our mutual enemy for her.

05:22.354 --> 05:23.865
She'll come around.

05:24.013 --> 05:27.497
That's not a gesture
of love to her.

05:27.723 --> 05:29.568
It's a weakness.

05:29.983 --> 05:34.755
It's another strand
in your unraveling psychosis.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.755
She doesn't see
her sister.

05:40.318 --> 05:43.263
She sees a soul
in need of saving.

05:43.857 --> 05:46.164
She's the city's hero.

05:46.544 --> 05:48.316
The city's hero
can't be seen

05:48.404 --> 05:51.122
sipping tea
with fugitive dreck.

05:52.146 --> 05:54.521
As long as she wears
that mask,

05:55.154 --> 05:58.685
you're never going to
bring her into this family.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.130
Hmm.

06:10.716 --> 06:15.058
Hey, guys. So this may
come as news to some of you,

06:15.146 --> 06:17.464
but my insta account's
not actually a place

06:17.552 --> 06:18.792
for you to list all the ways

06:18.880 --> 06:20.862
that I'm human garbage.

06:20.950 --> 06:22.677
My stepdad's a murderer,

06:22.857 --> 06:25.704
my mom's company's
corrupt, we're all evil.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.540
Got it loud and clear,

06:28.755 --> 06:31.081
and since there is not
enough bandwidth

06:31.169 --> 06:32.605
on the internet for me
to explain

06:32.693 --> 06:34.888
all of the ways
that you're wrong,

06:35.567 --> 06:38.182
I'm gonna sign off
for a bit.

06:38.341 --> 06:41.185
Be better
to each other seriously.

06:41.809 --> 06:43.325
Peace.

06:44.610 --> 06:45.870
Oh, my God!

06:45.958 --> 06:47.172
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

06:47.259 --> 06:49.448
I know, and you didn't
mean for your twin sister

06:49.536 --> 06:50.745
to poison my mother,

06:50.833 --> 06:53.052
but we all know how that turned out.

06:53.974 --> 06:56.191
I just... I wanted to let
you know that I put in a call

06:56.279 --> 06:57.706
to Hewitt
and Associates.

06:57.794 --> 07:00.038
I figured that
an extra legal team wouldn't hurt.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.542
Yeah, I know, which is why
they've all been hired.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.910
Thanks,
but we got this.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.482
- We?
- Your dad, Sophie, and me.

07:07.693 --> 07:10.753
Your dad has every lawyer
in Gotham on retainer,

07:10.841 --> 07:13.659
Sophie built a strike team
to try and find Mouse,

07:13.747 --> 07:15.862
and I am looking
for a plastic surgeon

07:15.950 --> 07:17.659
willing to testify
that face replacement's

07:17.747 --> 07:19.698
a great way
to frame someone for murder.

07:19.786 --> 07:21.380
Okay. How can I help?

07:21.965 --> 07:24.982
You could tell your sister
to stop defiling my mom's grave.

07:25.598 --> 07:29.379
Wow. She's been looking for
a way to get my attention.

07:29.855 --> 07:31.568
She thinks that
I want to be sisters.

07:32.403 --> 07:33.942
Isn't that what
you wanted?

07:35.053 --> 07:36.966
Look. If you want
to help,

07:37.244 --> 07:39.747
tell your sister to leave
my dead mother alone.

07:39.966 --> 07:41.505
She'll listen to you,
right?

07:42.177 --> 07:45.279
Oh. Wait.

07:46.085 --> 07:47.833
Mary, I am so sorry.

07:47.921 --> 07:50.292
I know. I know you are.
I know you never wanted

07:50.380 --> 07:51.944
to believe that your sister
could be capable

07:52.031 --> 07:54.860
of doing something
so horrible, but I did,

07:54.988 --> 07:57.193
and you decided
to ignore me...

07:59.284 --> 08:02.708
So I'm really busy.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.450
Bye.

08:17.610 --> 08:18.844
Ohh.

08:21.318 --> 08:22.787
Here. Put this on.

08:23.091 --> 08:24.723
We're officials for
the transit authority.

08:24.810 --> 08:26.511
Ever since
the Scarecrow incident,

08:26.599 --> 08:29.693
Gotham city trains run on an
independent analogue system.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.963
In theory, that should
make them unhackable.

08:32.049 --> 08:33.298
Suicidal conductor?

08:33.385 --> 08:34.705
The GCPD already released him.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.292
Black box data showed no
indication of engineer error.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.934
It was like the train's brake system
got possessed or something.

08:42.802 --> 08:44.138
Please don't touch that.

08:45.349 --> 08:48.880
Great. Well, that made
this harder by about 100%.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.563
Hmm.
This help?

09:06.651 --> 09:08.333
That could
theoretically

09:08.708 --> 09:10.333
have something
to do with it.

09:10.638 --> 09:12.810
Yeah.
It's a packet analyzer.

09:13.372 --> 09:14.811
It intercepts
and jumbles traffic

09:14.898 --> 09:16.836
as it passes over
a digital network.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.496
The hacker probably
used it to hijack

09:18.583 --> 09:20.115
the train's brakes remotely.

09:26.671 --> 09:28.839
<i>I love to dig
because when I dig</i>

09:28.927 --> 09:30.825
<i>I find all the secrets you bury.</i>

09:31.225 --> 09:32.746
- Did you just get...
- Same thing.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.089
<i>If I can hack
your subway,</i>

09:34.177 --> 09:36.550
<i>I can hack your phone, computer,</i>

09:36.638 --> 09:38.112
<i>home security cameras.</i>

09:38.200 --> 09:39.921
<i>Did I get your attention?</i>

09:40.008 --> 09:43.034
<i>Good. Now crowdfund
my escape from Gotham.</i>

09:43.121 --> 09:44.693
<i>Click the link

09:44.781 --> 09:47.387
<i>$5 million by midnight on Friday,</i>

<i>or your secrets come out.</i>

09:49.139 --> 09:50.949
<i>It doesn't matter if
you are a porn addict,</i>

09:51.037 --> 09:53.811
<i>masked vigilante,
or everyday Joe Schmo.</i>

09:54.032 --> 09:55.615
<i>Pay up, Gotham.</i>

10:01.482 --> 10:03.558
Mayor, are you calling
this a terrorist attack?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.966
Sir, how widespread
is the cyber breach?

10:05.053 --> 10:07.021
Folks, please just
let me speak.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.355
First and foremost,
Gotham city has

10:09.443 --> 10:11.028
no reason to be alarmed.

10:11.264 --> 10:14.065
We have layers of
cyber security in place,

10:14.334 --> 10:17.324
and we will certainly not
be coerced into the demands

10:17.412 --> 10:19.021
of some silly prankster.

10:19.748 --> 10:23.912
<i>I encourage everyone to go
about their daily activities.</i>

10:24.162 --> 10:25.972
Authorities are working
around the clock

10:26.060 --> 10:28.342
to ensure that this never
happens again.

10:28.692 --> 10:30.747
- You're kidding me.
- This guy's good.

10:30.835 --> 10:32.617
If you're so safe,
why is the Mayor's

10:32.704 --> 10:34.272
personal credit card number splashing

10:34.359 --> 10:35.586
all across the screen?

10:35.673 --> 10:37.693
Go shopping, Gotham.

10:40.177 --> 10:41.943
- What are you doing?
- Shutting us down.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.699
Guy just doxed the Mayor.

10:43.787 --> 10:45.402
We are one hack away
from total exposure.

10:45.490 --> 10:46.931
What, this thing
doesn't have a firewall?

10:47.018 --> 10:49.033
Guy just hijacked
the subway,

10:49.120 --> 10:51.785
the city cell network,
and overtook a feed on live TV.

10:51.873 --> 10:52.918
So?

10:53.006 --> 10:55.480
So you're the most
famous person in Gotham right now.

10:55.568 --> 10:57.074
You don't think you're
the obvious target here?

10:57.161 --> 10:58.926
Coming from the genius
who puts a bat emoji

10:59.014 --> 11:00.709
on every single
text message.

11:00.965 --> 11:02.084
That was just code.

11:02.171 --> 11:04.282
Look. Can't you just use
this to trace the IP address

11:04.369 --> 11:07.585
- and find the user's location?
- I could if we had internet.

11:07.672 --> 11:10.820
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Don't do it.

11:10.907 --> 11:12.621
We can't stop him
if we can't find him.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.933
We can't stop anyone if
everyone knows who you are.

11:15.021 --> 11:18.560
- Please.
- Seriously, don't.

11:19.384 --> 11:21.165
Whoops!

11:21.404 --> 11:23.301
5 minutes, then we go dark.

11:23.388 --> 11:25.404
- Fine.
- Fine.

11:56.824 --> 11:58.771
Food's getting cold,
Commander Kane.

12:01.783 --> 12:04.014
Where's your bite,
puppy dog?

12:04.929 --> 12:07.816
Some classic-ass poetry
that the man

12:07.904 --> 12:09.670
who locked up
half the fools in here

12:09.881 --> 12:12.420
is now eating out of
the same doggie bowl.

12:14.105 --> 12:15.539
Welcome home.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.367
Help yourself.

12:24.148 --> 12:26.108
So after all that,
we were able to pull

12:26.195 --> 12:28.514
your hearing up a week
because the last thing we need

12:28.602 --> 12:30.517
<i>is to start your trial
on Valentine's Day</i>

12:30.646 --> 12:33.032
<i>with a bunch of jurors thinking
about their significant others</i>

12:33.119 --> 12:35.973
while hearing the D.A.'s
theory on how you killed yours,

12:36.217 --> 12:38.886
but less great news...
I'm still working

12:38.974 --> 12:41.949
on, finding a medical expert
willing to testify

12:42.037 --> 12:43.683
that face swapping is
<i>totally a thing.</i>

12:43.771 --> 12:45.426
- Mary.
- <i>Dr. Keller is supposedly</i>

12:45.513 --> 12:47.746
on sabbatical,
AKA he's just too scared

12:47.834 --> 12:48.926
to be associated with you,

12:49.014 --> 12:50.521
and apparently,
<i>Professor Vivek</i>

12:50.608 --> 12:52.647
<i>is too good for us now
that he's been on...</i>

12:52.734 --> 12:54.310
Mary, stop.

12:55.193 --> 12:57.011
Your mother
has been killed,

12:57.099 --> 12:58.660
and Gotham thinks
I killed her.

12:58.748 --> 13:00.568
It's incomprehensible.

13:02.389 --> 13:04.029
How are you dealing
with everything?

13:04.139 --> 13:07.426
I'm engaging
in escapist strategies

13:07.514 --> 13:09.551
as a defense tactic
so that all the walls

13:09.639 --> 13:11.310
holding up everything
I know to be good and true

13:11.397 --> 13:13.514
don't come crumbling down
around me.

13:15.154 --> 13:18.215
Mary, Kate and I think you
need to talk to someone.

13:18.418 --> 13:19.733
Like who? You?

13:19.849 --> 13:21.886
You wanted to divorce
my mom.

13:22.264 --> 13:25.420
Your mother and I had
a fundamental difference of opinion,

13:25.724 --> 13:28.146
but I never stopped
wanting to be your dad.

13:29.029 --> 13:33.357
I don't have time to sit around
feeling sorry for myself,

13:34.277 --> 13:38.020
so we need to find
Alice, force a confession,

13:38.108 --> 13:39.511
and get you out of there.

13:39.599 --> 13:42.933
<i>Sit tight. I will find
somebody to help us.</i>

14:01.971 --> 14:04.120
Okay. The trace
on the device worked.

14:04.402 --> 14:07.300
This place is definitely
giving me "Mr. Robot" vibes.

14:08.057 --> 14:10.605
Batwoman to Batcave.
Luke?

14:11.222 --> 14:12.769
You turned the comms off.

14:13.503 --> 14:16.007
One of you needs
to start talking.

14:20.231 --> 14:23.019
We've been surveilling
this operation for months.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.509
Up until last night,
you were just rejects

14:25.597 --> 14:27.533
working for a Russian
hacking ring, who got off

14:27.621 --> 14:30.199
on stealing social security
checks from old ladies,

14:31.300 --> 14:33.190
so why hijack a subway?

14:33.277 --> 14:36.861
We didn't do that.
We're not terrorists.

14:36.996 --> 14:39.285
Oh, now you
want to talk?

14:40.949 --> 14:43.511
So which one of you cut
the brakes on the train?

14:43.996 --> 14:45.710
I swear
none of us.

14:45.923 --> 14:48.236
My wife takes the train
to work every morning.

14:48.324 --> 14:49.832
I'd never do that to...

14:51.652 --> 14:55.793
Which one of you
cut the brakes?

14:56.100 --> 14:58.160
I promise you
on my mother's grave

14:58.347 --> 14:59.918
it wasn't us!

15:01.425 --> 15:02.514
Please don't kill me.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.203
Then answer
the damn question!

15:30.605 --> 15:31.777
I know you're there.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.154
Want to talk about it?

15:37.332 --> 15:38.550
Not really.

15:38.822 --> 15:41.785
I get it.
Maybe some other time.

15:42.839 --> 15:44.829
You ever feel like you're
hiding from the world?

15:44.941 --> 15:47.535
I'm literally standing in a shadow.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.251
Not sure why I'm asking someone
who crushes on Slam Bradley

15:51.339 --> 15:52.722
for life advice.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.666
Try me.

16:00.956 --> 16:02.707
My husband left me.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.191
I'm sorry.

16:07.143 --> 16:09.089
He thinks I'm lying to myself.

16:09.974 --> 16:11.308
Are you?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.683
Maybe.

16:18.316 --> 16:21.097
Or maybe I'm too
terrified to deal with it.

16:21.685 --> 16:23.399
We all wear a mask.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.793
Maybe it's time
you took yours off.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.295
You're one to talk.

16:38.536 --> 16:40.488
Oh, Dr. Campbell!

16:40.629 --> 16:43.574
- Mary, are you okay?
- Yes. Um...

16:44.183 --> 16:46.066
I was so sorry
to hear about your mom.

16:46.154 --> 16:49.092
That night at the Gala
was absolutely horrific.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.150
Thank you.
I know that you're busy,

16:51.238 --> 16:52.429
and I don't mean
to ambush you

16:52.516 --> 16:53.723
after a 3-hour college lecture,

16:53.810 --> 16:56.230
but I read your
dissertation on skin grafts

16:56.318 --> 16:58.792
and facial restoration and
wondered if you'd be willing

16:58.880 --> 17:01.644
to be an expert witness
in my stepdad's trial.

17:01.732 --> 17:04.515
I'm sorry.
I-I'm not following.

17:04.603 --> 17:07.767
He was set up by a guy
who made a face out of real skin

17:07.855 --> 17:10.425
that looks exactly
like Jacob Kane.

17:10.593 --> 17:12.564
Look. I know what
it sounds like,

17:12.760 --> 17:14.775
and you think that
I'm in denial

17:14.863 --> 17:16.414
and grabbing at straws, and, yes,

17:16.501 --> 17:18.255
I have seen
every episode of "Dateline",

17:18.342 --> 17:19.656
and I know the husband
always does it,

17:19.743 --> 17:20.988
but not this time.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.496
Look.
Your mother was really generous

17:23.584 --> 17:25.792
to Gotham University,
and I wish I could help,

17:25.881 --> 17:30.045
but for a man to perfectly
resemble another man?

17:30.133 --> 17:33.686
It's... it's science fiction, Mary.

17:33.975 --> 17:35.920
I know
what I saw.

17:37.365 --> 17:41.826
Sometimes when
people are under extreme duress,

17:41.914 --> 17:45.113
they...
see what they want to see.

17:46.402 --> 17:48.746
I'm sorry I can't
be more helpful.

17:49.105 --> 17:51.187
I really am.

17:51.384 --> 17:52.751
Good night.

17:54.870 --> 17:56.137
Ugh.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.894
You turned off the comms?

18:00.984 --> 18:02.298
We went dark.

18:02.652 --> 18:04.041
That includes satellite feed.

18:04.129 --> 18:05.877
Now once you find
the Terrier terrorist,

18:05.965 --> 18:08.352
I'll reconnect. Until then,
you're running solo.

18:08.439 --> 18:10.307
Packet analyzer
was a diversion tactic.

18:10.394 --> 18:11.900
Whoever planted it
rerouted the IP

18:11.988 --> 18:13.301
to some
Snowden wannabe.

18:13.389 --> 18:16.019
So much for honor
among cyber thieves.

18:17.518 --> 18:19.015
- Am I a fraud?
- You still hung up

18:19.103 --> 18:20.841
on this Slam Bradley
love affair?

18:20.928 --> 18:22.229
Yeah. Whenever I put
on this suit,

18:22.316 --> 18:24.254
I feel like I'm lying
to our entire city.

18:24.474 --> 18:25.886
Well, that's the job.

18:26.577 --> 18:27.933
According the Multiverse,
my job

18:28.021 --> 18:29.582
is to be
a Paragon of Courage.

18:29.739 --> 18:31.814
Right because
a Paragon finder said so

18:31.902 --> 18:33.364
before the infinite Earths
collapsed

18:33.451 --> 18:34.999
into a single
space-time continuum.

18:35.086 --> 18:36.472
I'm sure it was all
very exciting.

18:36.786 --> 18:39.150
I live in shadows,
I wear a disguise,

18:39.238 --> 18:42.106
and I let people believe that
I am dating Captain America.

18:42.324 --> 18:43.761
What part of that
is courageous?

18:43.849 --> 18:46.261
Kicking bad guys' asses
to protect your city

18:46.349 --> 18:47.634
is pretty damn courageous.

18:47.722 --> 18:50.714
You said it yourself.
I'm the most famous face in Gotham,

18:50.957 --> 18:53.847
but their image of me
is not me.

18:54.535 --> 18:56.787
They think
you're a hero, Kate.

18:57.168 --> 18:58.496
You are.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.275
This... is going to help you.

19:01.363 --> 19:02.893
It's an electric
charge disruptor.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.628
It'll kill
every electric current

19:04.715 --> 19:07.035
within a 100-meter
radius for 10 seconds.

19:07.385 --> 19:08.550
How does that help us?

19:08.637 --> 19:10.438
Because whoever hacked
Gotham probably has

19:10.525 --> 19:13.095
a firewall on her phone
strong enough to resist this.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.381
If we narrow down
her location,

19:14.468 --> 19:16.910
kill the power,
her phone stays on, boom.

19:17.332 --> 19:18.894
You keep saying, "her".

19:19.251 --> 19:20.832
Right. I was just
about to get to that.

19:20.964 --> 19:23.168
Consider us both guilty
of making assumptions.

19:24.644 --> 19:28.386
So I did an offline
reverse audio modulation

19:28.643 --> 19:30.955
of the talking Terrier emoji
to access

19:31.043 --> 19:32.673
the hacker's actual voice.

19:32.761 --> 19:33.959
If I can hack your subway...

19:34.046 --> 19:35.993
I can hack your phone, computer,

19:36.080 --> 19:37.628
home security cameras.

19:37.793 --> 19:40.707
It's a girl,
like, a young girl.

19:41.217 --> 19:42.394
Play it again.

19:43.587 --> 19:45.955
If I can hack your subway,
I can hack your phone...

19:46.043 --> 19:46.937
You hear that? Lower the voice,

19:47.024 --> 19:49.073
- amplify the background.
- Okay.

19:49.316 --> 19:50.741
If I can hack the subway,
I can hack your phone...

19:50.828 --> 19:52.409
Right there.
Isolate that.

19:52.605 --> 19:53.844
You hear that?

19:54.347 --> 19:55.412
That melodic tone?

19:55.582 --> 19:57.863
It's a bell. I recognize it.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.102
I know where she recorded this.

20:02.831 --> 20:05.154
The most vile, lawless
place in the world,

20:05.433 --> 20:06.723
Gotham Prep.

20:08.279 --> 20:09.644
My old high school.

20:13.605 --> 20:14.953
What'd Campbell say?

20:15.041 --> 20:16.555
Apparently, the psychological

20:16.607 --> 20:18.652
ramifications of witnessing
my mother's death

20:18.740 --> 20:21.037
have caused me to see and
believe things that are not there.

20:21.124 --> 20:24.197
- He thinks you're crazy.
- Totally off my rocker

20:24.285 --> 20:26.090
just like everyone else.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.754
Look, Mary.
It's not my business,

20:29.842 --> 20:33.722
but... have you tried
talking to Kate?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.996
She lost her mom, too.
She's been through this.

20:37.174 --> 20:40.543
I know, which makes not trusting
her that much more tragic.

20:41.253 --> 20:42.888
We'll find someone
who can help your dad.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.777
My cousin went to med
school in Metropolis.

20:44.865 --> 20:46.191
Maybe she knows
a plastic surgeon.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.340
- Okay. That's creepy.
- What?

20:49.052 --> 20:51.293
Alice is at Gotham University.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.183
- Are you sure?
- The woman poisoned my mother,

20:54.271 --> 20:55.519
then danced on
her grave.

20:55.607 --> 20:57.058
Yes, I know
what Alice looks like.

20:57.146 --> 20:59.511
Mary, get out of there now.
I'm sending a team.

21:19.014 --> 21:20.152
Who's the Terrier?

21:20.240 --> 21:21.550
What just happened?

21:22.154 --> 21:24.043
I asked who's the Terrier?

21:24.560 --> 21:28.754
Um, so not me,
but do you mind?

21:28.842 --> 21:30.246
Batwoman crashed our party.

21:30.334 --> 21:32.323
- This is sick.
- <i>Oh, my God. Is Slam Bradley here, too?</i>

21:32.410 --> 21:34.933
- Batselfie. What's up?
- Nope.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.061
<i>- What just happened? Hey!
- Who broke my phone?</i>

21:56.164 --> 21:58.436
- <i>Who turned out the lights?</i>
- Why'd it just go dark?

21:58.685 --> 22:01.132
Wait. What did you do
with our phones?

22:01.389 --> 22:03.014
<i>- What happened?
- Come on.</i>

22:03.101 --> 22:04.952
Hey. My phone's
not working, man.

22:13.311 --> 22:15.866
♪ Answer me,
answer me, answer me, aw ♪

22:22.561 --> 22:25.210
What do you want?
I'm just a kid at a dance.

22:25.305 --> 22:26.468
Hmm.

22:26.625 --> 22:27.858
If I can hack your subway...

22:27.946 --> 22:30.053
I can hack your phone,
computer,

22:30.141 --> 22:31.303
home security cameras.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.928
A kid who hacked a subway
full of innocent people.

22:34.016 --> 22:35.249
You got a name?

22:35.337 --> 22:36.784
You don't know my name?

22:36.953 --> 22:39.021
Thought you were some
badass crime fighter.

22:41.673 --> 22:44.944
Parker Torres, and I wasn't
gonna crash the train.

22:45.116 --> 22:46.468
My grappling hook begs
to differ.

22:46.556 --> 22:49.702
I was on it, controlling
it from my phone.

22:49.940 --> 22:52.405
I was gonna stop it,
but you stopped it first.

22:52.948 --> 22:54.763
Whatever.
It was a dumb prank.

22:54.881 --> 22:56.436
What the hell
were you thinking?

22:56.524 --> 22:58.472
I'm sorry, okay? Chill!

22:58.560 --> 23:00.835
I... don't... chill.

23:01.753 --> 23:07.007
Look. I really am sorry.

23:07.708 --> 23:11.030
I just thought
if I could scare

23:11.118 --> 23:13.328
my parents into thinking
I almost died

23:13.416 --> 23:15.465
they'd just be happy
I was alive

23:15.617 --> 23:17.866
and forget their daughter
was a freak.

23:18.053 --> 23:19.921
- You're not a freak.
- I am to them.

23:21.208 --> 23:22.710
I'm, uh...

23:23.536 --> 23:24.819
gay.

23:26.779 --> 23:28.671
Kayla Mason revenge outed me

23:28.759 --> 23:30.207
to my mom and dad.

23:30.334 --> 23:32.835
- Kayla Mason?
- My ex.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.132
She said being in the
closet was prehistoric.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.530
I either told them
the truth,

23:40.625 --> 23:42.053
or she'd leave me.

23:42.109 --> 23:44.296
She didn't get it.
I couldn't

23:44.436 --> 23:47.653
tell the truth, so when
I told her to just go,

23:47.741 --> 23:51.163
she went nuclear and
told my parents for me.

23:52.053 --> 23:53.739
My mom and dad thought
they'd been raising

23:53.827 --> 23:56.007
some BTS-loving heteronorm.

23:56.116 --> 23:57.958
Now they sleep
clutching rosaries

23:58.046 --> 23:59.639
and want to disown me.

23:59.740 --> 24:01.020
That's why I need the money...

24:01.108 --> 24:02.317
To get out of Gotham.

24:02.405 --> 24:04.436
That sucks,
and it's not fair,

24:04.528 --> 24:05.982
but it is not an excuse

24:06.079 --> 24:07.655
- to put hundreds of lives in jeopardy...
- My parents want me

24:07.742 --> 24:09.538
to be someone I'm not.

24:09.912 --> 24:11.546
Do you know
how that feels?

24:13.749 --> 24:16.725
I hate myself, okay?

24:18.866 --> 24:23.911
And let's raincheck
your it gets better PSA.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.926
We both know
I'm gonna grow up

24:26.014 --> 24:28.614
hiding my girlfriends
and aspiring

24:28.702 --> 24:30.882
to be represented by
an ancillary character

24:30.991 --> 24:33.104
on my favorite
TV show

24:33.779 --> 24:35.553
just like you were
probably

24:35.803 --> 24:37.200
the cool girl
in high school,

24:37.288 --> 24:39.700
and now you're famous,
and everyone's shipping you

24:39.788 --> 24:41.592
and the hottest guy
in Gotham.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.528
We have nothing in common.

24:46.616 --> 24:49.387
In fact, you pretending
to feel bad for me

24:49.475 --> 24:50.770
is kind of making it worse,

24:50.858 --> 24:52.801
so could you just
leave me alone

24:52.889 --> 24:55.702
before I find more reasons
to wish I were dead?

25:07.576 --> 25:10.327
Moore to base. Just
showed up to Gotham U.

25:16.024 --> 25:18.741
She saw her go
into room 119.

25:41.132 --> 25:43.820
You're... that psycho.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.914
Oh. Charmed
I'm sure,

25:48.297 --> 25:50.687
and I understand
you're the Terrier.

26:00.804 --> 26:02.601
Run, Parker!

26:12.557 --> 26:14.104
Don't worry about the Bat.

26:14.192 --> 26:15.570
She'll come play later.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.328
For now,
believe it or not,

26:18.416 --> 26:20.096
I actually need you.

26:27.916 --> 26:30.189
Mmm!
I love living in a world

26:30.277 --> 26:32.792
where we trust teenagers
with these things.

26:33.073 --> 26:34.594
Why are you doing this?

26:34.681 --> 26:36.743
Because my inner
mean girl never got to

26:36.831 --> 26:38.792
live out her high school
experience.

26:39.167 --> 26:42.103
- Ahh!
- I'm looking for Batwoman,

26:42.191 --> 26:43.769
and your moronic
classmates

26:43.857 --> 26:45.261
tagged her
in a photo here.

26:45.348 --> 26:46.683
Knock it off.

26:46.870 --> 26:50.353
Ohh. Good.
The hall monitor's back.

26:50.441 --> 26:51.941
Let the girl go.

26:53.620 --> 26:57.212
I will, but first, I need you

26:57.300 --> 27:00.478
to figure out that
you are not a hero.

27:00.566 --> 27:02.191
What does she
have to do with this?

27:03.352 --> 27:06.525
She is
a very important tool

27:06.613 --> 27:09.695
in my
very important plan,

27:09.782 --> 27:12.377
which I'll tell you
after you drop

27:12.464 --> 27:13.897
the whole hero complex.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.355
Take off the mask, Batwoman.

27:31.230 --> 27:33.551
What's going on?
Where is everyone?

27:33.822 --> 27:35.253
What's the point
of running a clinic

27:35.386 --> 27:37.355
when you can't even save
your own mom?

27:37.735 --> 27:39.159
I'm not a doctor.

27:39.628 --> 27:41.251
If you're here,
I'm hoping that means

27:41.339 --> 27:42.904
that Alice is at Arkham.

27:44.941 --> 27:46.432
She wasn't
at Gotham University.

27:46.519 --> 27:47.806
What are you t
alking about?

27:47.894 --> 27:49.196
I saw her run
into that building.

27:49.284 --> 27:51.120
We searched
every dorm room, Mary.

27:51.491 --> 27:52.839
She wasn't there.

27:53.159 --> 27:55.174
Maybe Dr. Campbell was
right.

27:55.355 --> 27:58.886
You should go somewhere,
relax, grieve your mom.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.714
You think
I'm seeing things, too.

28:03.836 --> 28:06.285
I think your world
just fell apart,

28:06.605 --> 28:08.509
and you're looking for
something to distract you

28:08.597 --> 28:10.386
from how painful it is.

28:11.320 --> 28:15.363
Look. No judgment.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.738
My marriage just blew up,

28:22.362 --> 28:25.472
and I nearly took
the wrong guy's head off earlier.

28:26.775 --> 28:28.120
We're human.

28:29.307 --> 28:33.238
We'd rather be doing anything
other than feeling our feelings.

28:35.301 --> 28:37.698
I'm not crazy.

28:38.638 --> 28:42.620
I swear I'm not
imagining things, Sophie.

28:43.174 --> 28:46.519
Finding Alice isn't going
to bring your mom back.

28:50.718 --> 28:53.834
What's wrong, Batwoman?
Shy?

28:54.086 --> 28:56.102
Come on. Show us your pretty,
little face.

28:56.189 --> 28:57.282
Why are you doing this?

28:57.370 --> 29:00.759
Because you are obsessed
with saving people

29:00.847 --> 29:02.704
who don't want
to be saved.

29:02.792 --> 29:04.677
Give up, give up,
give up!

29:04.925 --> 29:06.612
I know
what you're doing.

29:06.699 --> 29:08.853
I put away the Bat
so I can join you

29:08.941 --> 29:10.753
on some twisted fairy tale.

29:11.604 --> 29:14.520
Ding, ding, ding, ding!
Ha ha ha!

29:14.607 --> 29:17.123
- Aah!
- Take off the mask, batty!

29:17.210 --> 29:18.948
You're sick, Alice.

29:20.847 --> 29:22.056
Alice, stop.

29:22.144 --> 29:23.529
Aah! No!

29:23.616 --> 29:24.663
Stop it!

29:24.750 --> 29:26.003
Do it!

29:26.376 --> 29:27.402
Aah!

29:27.490 --> 29:28.990
Fine!

29:35.596 --> 29:37.292
Holy crap.

29:41.651 --> 29:44.486
- You're Kate Kane.
- That would be me.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.665
I, like, drive by your
real estate firm every day.

29:47.753 --> 29:48.928
- H-Hi.
- Hi.

29:49.015 --> 29:51.581
I just read "The Advocate",
"Lesbian CEOs under 30".

29:51.830 --> 29:54.099
Oh, my God. I was such
a bitch to you earlier.

29:54.187 --> 29:56.566
Why didn't you say
you were supergay?

29:57.308 --> 29:59.712
Kind of still trying to figure
out much to tell people.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.087
Okay. Hello! Boring.

30:02.175 --> 30:05.019
- Can we move this along, please?
- Happily. Just let her go.

30:05.107 --> 30:08.530
No. I meant with the
next phase of my plan.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.589
See, I've been
following you,

30:10.770 --> 30:12.884
and now I need
yber sunshine to do

30:12.972 --> 30:15.144
that thing that
she did when she accesses

30:15.253 --> 30:18.113
everyone's phone on
Gotham's cellular network,

30:18.261 --> 30:21.194
and then
I need her to out my sister

30:21.281 --> 30:23.262
as Gotham's
redheaded knight.

30:23.636 --> 30:25.365
Don't do this, Alice.

30:25.729 --> 30:30.782
No hero, no Bat,
no one trying to change who I am.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.572
Everyone lives
happily ever after.

30:32.792 --> 30:35.226
And if I don't,
what are you gonna do,

30:35.313 --> 30:36.870
kill me?

30:37.191 --> 30:39.988
You need me.
If you kill me, you lose.

30:40.855 --> 30:45.218
As do you because
you're dead.

30:45.417 --> 30:46.607
I'm sorry.
Do they not teach

30:46.695 --> 30:48.370
Math in school anymore?
Alice!

30:48.746 --> 30:49.888
It's fine.

30:49.976 --> 30:53.644
I'm obviously
not going to kill her.

30:54.914 --> 30:58.164
I will kill everyone else
in this school, though.

30:58.251 --> 31:00.566
I didn't know
who to bring to the dance,

31:00.948 --> 31:03.050
so I brought C-4.

31:09.662 --> 31:12.478
They do still teach Science
in this school, right?

31:12.636 --> 31:13.650
You're lying.

31:13.738 --> 31:14.863
No, she's not.

31:14.951 --> 31:16.833
I'm not outing Batwoman.

31:17.316 --> 31:19.130
Send the message,
or she will kill

31:19.217 --> 31:20.620
everyone in here.

31:20.707 --> 31:23.751
If I out you, everyone you
care about will be in danger.

31:23.839 --> 31:26.025
You'll probably be arrested,
you won't be Batwoman anymore.

31:26.112 --> 31:27.198
I can take care of myself.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.700
But Gotham can't!

31:29.245 --> 31:30.663
We need you.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.338
If Batwoman goes away,

31:32.425 --> 31:34.448
this city's hope
goes with it.

31:34.863 --> 31:36.558
I think I just puked
in my mouth.

31:36.646 --> 31:38.128
We'll do it.

31:40.542 --> 31:41.917
Tell everyone.

31:43.047 --> 31:44.299
Fine.

we figured out why

31:54.474 --> 31:57.792
they call you
Generation Z because...

31:58.385 --> 32:01.370
You try hacking 10 cellular
networks with one hand.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.620
It's done.
I did it.

32:09.730 --> 32:11.972
All of Gotham now knows
Kate's secret.

32:29.609 --> 32:31.507
Is everyone seeing this?

32:32.397 --> 32:34.848
Alpha team, we're on
the move to Gotham Prep.

32:34.936 --> 32:36.468

Go!

32:59.659 --> 33:01.254
Now where were we?

33:01.418 --> 33:02.999
Ohh!

33:03.508 --> 33:04.723
What? Hey!

33:04.811 --> 33:06.231
Right out about there.

33:07.332 --> 33:08.716
How do I disarm this bomb?

33:08.804 --> 33:12.653
Enough with the games.
You're not a hero!

33:13.669 --> 33:16.598
It doesn't take a hero to know
what pure evil looks like.

33:19.225 --> 33:21.692
You ruined my life.

33:23.426 --> 33:26.480
I fixed your life, Kate.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.611
Our father didn't
believe us,

33:28.699 --> 33:30.184
and now he's being
punished.

33:30.272 --> 33:33.401
Catherine tried to keep
us apart for 15 years,

33:33.489 --> 33:35.488
and now she's dead.

33:35.723 --> 33:39.453
What more do I have to do
to prove my loyalty to you?

33:39.622 --> 33:41.230
You can tell me that
you didn't put a bomb

33:41.317 --> 33:42.489
in a gym full of kids.

33:42.577 --> 33:44.575
Ugh. Here we go again.

33:44.662 --> 33:46.160
- Judgy, judgy, judge, judge.
- If everything you have done

33:46.247 --> 33:47.334
has been some
kind of gift to me,

33:47.421 --> 33:49.005
then take it all back.

33:50.523 --> 33:54.177
Why can't you accept me
for who I am?

33:54.973 --> 33:58.528
We're sisters, Kate.
Be my sister.

33:59.567 --> 34:01.184
We were sisters,

34:01.778 --> 34:03.466
and then Beth died,

34:03.989 --> 34:05.721
and the world would
be a whole lot better

34:05.808 --> 34:07.762
if she had stayed dead.

34:10.408 --> 34:12.027
I don't believe you.

34:14.690 --> 34:18.020
What did she do?
What did she do?!

34:21.420 --> 34:23.202
She saved their lives.

34:26.161 --> 34:28.589
Establish the perimeter,
then make contact.

34:28.677 --> 34:29.875
I'll need a team
to the west.

34:29.962 --> 34:31.654
There's a faculty
entrance on the south side.

34:31.741 --> 34:34.262
Let's get there now.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

34:36.803 --> 34:38.333
Get off the driveway!

34:38.475 --> 34:40.036
There's a bomb
in the high school!

34:40.123 --> 34:41.572
Get back!
Take cover!

34:41.659 --> 34:43.690
<i>- Do you know what's happening?
- Oh, my God!</i>

34:44.283 --> 34:46.023
Come on.
Let's go! Come on.

34:46.110 --> 34:49.362
Everyone out.
Go! Let's go now! Move!

34:49.541 --> 34:53.408
Well,
she saved most of their lives.

34:53.547 --> 34:54.822
What are you talking
about?

34:54.909 --> 34:57.712
No one said that
that was the detonator.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.283
- Where is it?
- Hmm!

35:12.405 --> 35:14.053
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

35:14.140 --> 35:15.640
Oh, my God!

35:35.194 --> 35:36.738
Not happening.

35:37.027 --> 35:38.393
Why not?

35:45.463 --> 35:48.767
It's... a... office.

35:50.788 --> 35:52.471
What were you expecting?

35:52.910 --> 35:56.326
Like, I don't know,
a bunker or something.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.509
W-W-Where's
your Batbike?

35:58.651 --> 36:00.213
What Batbike?

36:01.353 --> 36:04.471
Oh.
What Batbike? Tch.

36:08.664 --> 36:10.680
Ow. Child, remember?

36:10.768 --> 36:12.353
Community service
for that stunt

36:12.441 --> 36:13.424
that you pulled on the subway

36:13.512 --> 36:15.619
and then
doxing the Mayor.

36:16.828 --> 36:19.610
150 hours scrubbing
graffiti?

36:19.798 --> 36:21.754
Yeah, and if I find out
that you're still hacking,

36:21.841 --> 36:23.885
you'll be scrubbing
toilets at Gotham Juvie.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.008
Oh, and you're gonna pay
back every single person

36:26.096 --> 36:27.752
who sent you blackmail money.

36:29.211 --> 36:30.830
Fine.

36:32.084 --> 36:33.853
Alice could have killed you.

36:34.352 --> 36:37.385
I was outed before
I wanted my parents to know.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.455
I wasn't about to do
the same thing to you,

36:39.558 --> 36:41.328
and if you're wondering
if I'm gonna tell

36:41.416 --> 36:43.528
- anyone about you, I'm...
- I'm not.

36:45.865 --> 36:47.338
Dismissed.

36:48.098 --> 36:51.134
Okay then.
See you around.

36:54.773 --> 36:56.228
Parker...

36:57.576 --> 36:58.986
You're right.

36:59.464 --> 37:01.916
Sometimes, it feels like
it's not gonna get better,

37:02.658 --> 37:05.564
but you will if you
stop hating yourself.

37:05.807 --> 37:07.955
If you ever want to
talk about your parents

37:08.138 --> 37:12.330
or Kayla Mason
or anyone, I'm here.

37:13.562 --> 37:15.111
Thanks.

37:16.762 --> 37:20.379
You know, um, when
you took off your mask,

37:20.603 --> 37:23.650
I never in a million years
expected it to be you,

37:24.049 --> 37:25.846
someone like me.

37:26.073 --> 37:27.478
I'm glad it was.

37:43.375 --> 37:46.728
No one offered you
anything to drink.

37:48.761 --> 37:50.299
Good.

37:51.329 --> 37:53.455
Careful, Sophie.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.875
We know
how this job worked out

37:55.963 --> 37:57.502
for your old boss.

37:59.872 --> 38:03.307
The Mayor was more than
willing to hand you over to me,

38:04.181 --> 38:06.617
so you're going to sit here
indefinitely

38:06.705 --> 38:09.614
until you tell me
where to find Mouse.

38:11.684 --> 38:13.935
Ha ha ha!

38:15.988 --> 38:18.529
Well, look who reached
cover girl status.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.121
Look. I... I know
what you're gonna say.

38:21.209 --> 38:23.075
It was reckless,
it links me to Batwoman,

38:23.162 --> 38:24.288
it puts our operation
in jeopardy...

38:24.375 --> 38:26.402
I was gonna say that
a whole lot of people

38:26.490 --> 38:28.213
are about to feel
a lot less alone,

38:28.419 --> 38:30.176
and if there's fallout,
we'll figure it out.

38:33.071 --> 38:34.819
- Happy birthday.
- Ha!

38:34.907 --> 38:36.896
Baked it myself,
by the way.

38:37.427 --> 38:38.974
Turns out
when I'm not on the comms

38:39.062 --> 38:41.248
I have way too much
free time on my hands.

38:41.568 --> 38:43.748
Yeah. Can you not leave
me alone like that again?

38:43.836 --> 38:46.184
Oh. It's weird. Kind of
sounds like you missed me.

38:46.518 --> 38:48.886
- I managed.
- So that's a yes.

38:51.724 --> 38:53.358
I hope it comes true.

39:07.507 --> 39:10.937
Okay, people.
Time to recalibrate our gaydar.

39:11.048 --> 39:12.711
Batwoman is a lesbian?

39:12.799 --> 39:14.451
Not that there's
anything wrong with that,

39:14.539 --> 39:15.545
but talk to me Gotham.

39:15.633 --> 39:19.000
Whatever happened to politics
staying out of our superheroes?

39:20.881 --> 39:23.054
<i>We all wear a mask
of some kind,</i>

39:23.242 --> 39:28.023
<i>a cowl, a husband,
wife, denial, anger.</i>

39:28.711 --> 39:31.836
<i>We all need our shield to
protect us from the world,</i>

39:33.132 --> 39:34.961
<i>but for people like us,</i>

39:35.277 --> 39:37.859
<i>it's not always about
stopping a runaway train</i>

39:38.118 --> 39:40.318
<i>or disarming a bomb.</i>

39:43.270 --> 39:45.561
Okay. As a doctor,
you should really remove

39:45.649 --> 39:48.064
the word "crazy" from
your everyday vernacular.

39:49.259 --> 39:50.798
Uh-huh.

39:51.608 --> 39:55.459
Yeah. Thanks. Have fun on
the wrong side of history.

39:55.547 --> 39:56.930
Bye.

39:59.046 --> 40:00.469
Hi.

40:07.437 --> 40:09.619
<i>Sometimes,
the best way to save someone</i>

40:09.924 --> 40:12.067
<i>is to be yourself.</i>

40:18.764 --> 40:21.451
You were right. Mary
just really needed a hug.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.405
I'm sure she wasn't
the only one.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.803
You two are gonna need each
other now more than ever.

40:27.268 --> 40:29.045
You're on my phone,
puppy dog.

40:29.267 --> 40:31.057
We're gonna get you
out of there, Dad.

40:31.371 --> 40:33.924
I wish I could be
with you today.

40:34.840 --> 40:37.025
Happy birthday, kiddo.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.045
Ahh.

40:46.452 --> 40:48.194
Happy birthday!

40:48.709 --> 40:50.091
How did you get in here?

40:50.178 --> 40:52.758
Uh, easy.
Hey. Did you guys fire

40:52.845 --> 40:54.709
that hot front desk guy?

40:54.858 --> 40:56.855
Because he was the
best part of this place.

40:57.069 --> 40:58.538
Hi.

41:00.352 --> 41:01.944
I'm back.

41:03.007 --> 41:04.375
Happy birthday.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.635
- Did Sophie let you go?
- Who?

41:06.722 --> 41:09.090
Kate, I finally come home
from a semester abroad,

41:09.178 --> 41:10.996
and this is how
you react?

41:11.155 --> 41:13.145
It's bad enough
that they converted my apartment

41:13.232 --> 41:15.483
into a boys' dorm room,
and no one

41:15.571 --> 41:17.272
chose to tell...
Kate!

41:17.616 --> 41:19.064
Unh!

41:19.425 --> 41:22.677
- Who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

41:22.765 --> 41:25.098
- Ow! Ow!
- Who are you?!

41:25.186 --> 41:27.038
Me! Beth!

41:27.806 --> 41:29.110
Beth?!

41:29.251 --> 41:31.108
Who the hell else
would I be?

41:32.608 --> 41:34.608
