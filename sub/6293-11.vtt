CAN REALLY DIG IN.

THE WALLS

05:53.921 --> 05:55.689

05:55.723 --> 05:57.691
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET
OUT OF SURVIVAL MODE

05:57.725 --> 05:59.827
AND REALLY START TO LIVE.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.430

OF FAMILY INVOLVEMENT

SOME LEMONADE.

FOR HIS BIRTHDAY,

06:30.223 --> 06:33.527

OF THE ALTERS WILL LIKE IT.

>> WHEN I STARTED DISASSOCIATING
AFTER IRAQ,

06:38.699 --> 06:41.068

AT HIDING IT.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.832
MY TRAUMA HAPPENED
WHEN I WAS 16,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.167
SO I DIDN'T START SWITCHING
TILL AFTER THAT,

07:14.201 --> 07:17.505
BUT, UH, WHENEVER I WOULD COME
BACK FROM A TRANSITION,

07:17.538 --> 07:20.541
I KNEW EXACTLY
HOW TO COVER AND GET BY.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.577
>> YEAH, WE'LL DO ALMOST
ANYTHING TO APPEAR NORMAL.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.547
>> I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED AT BOARDING SCHOOL,

07:26.580 --> 07:29.683

VIVID MEMORIES

07:29.717 --> 07:32.553
OF A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.555
IT WAS A MONTH
UNTIL SUMMER BREAK,

07:34.588 --> 07:35.923
AND I COULDN'T WAIT
TO GET OUT.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.258

A TOTAL SUMMER PERSON.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.727

I WORE MY BATHING SUIT

07:42.162 --> 07:44.064
UNDER MY CLOTHES EVERY DAY.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.599
>> [laughs]

WAS GOING TO CLASS

07:47.635 --> 07:48.936
AND GOING ON
WITH THEIR LIVES,

07:48.969 --> 07:51.639
I JUST SAT IN MY DORM WINDOW

07:51.672 --> 07:54.808
WAITING FOR SUMMER TO COME.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.545
>> DID IT?

07:57.578 --> 08:00.848
>> THE NEXT THING
I REMEMBER...

08:00.881 --> 08:03.116
IS SNOW...

08:03.150 --> 08:05.085
EVERYWHERE.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.022
I WAS AT MY PARENTS',

08:09.056 --> 08:12.560
AND SIX MONTHS HAD GONE BY
IN AN INSTANT.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.696
AND IT WAS JUST...

08:18.065 --> 08:20.734
WHITE.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.804
>> WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE SNOW?

08:23.837 --> 08:26.740
>> IT WAS...

08:26.774 --> 08:29.509
I MEAN, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.754

08:56.637 --> 08:58.005
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.173
I AM SO SORRY.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.875
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.944
I MEAN, MY MOM'S
A TOTAL FREAK SHOW.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.746
SHE'S ACTUALLY

09:05.779 --> 09:08.882
AT A HOSPITAL
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE NOW.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.685
>> SHE IS?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.887
WOW.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.188
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY HAD HOSPITALS

09:15.222 --> 09:16.590
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
ANYMORE.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.892
>> T-THERE'S, LIKE, ONE.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.861
IT'S OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO.

A-ANYWAY, MY AUNT'S STAYING
WITH US, WHICH I'M COOL WITH,

09:23.931 --> 09:25.265
SO...

09:25.298 --> 09:26.800
SO DO YOU WANT--

09:26.834 --> 09:29.837
>> I FEEL REALLY BAD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.339
I EVEN TALKED
TO MY DAD ABOUT IT.

09:32.372 --> 09:36.677
LISTEN, I THINK YOU'RE THE MOST
AWESOME KID IN THE SCHOOL.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.246

YOUR OSCAR, OKAY?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.751
[bell ringing]

09:46.887 --> 09:51.024

YOU CAN GET HIM TO COME OUT?

CO-CONSCIOUSNESS WITH GIMME.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.308
WHEN T HIT
ON YOUR SON'S FRIEND?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.044

EVERYTHING SHE WAS DOING.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE--

10:12.079 --> 10:13.413
NOT KNOWING WHAT YOU DO

10:13.446 --> 10:16.349
OR SEEING IT
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP IT.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.318
>> LOOK,
YOU CAN DO THIS, TARA.

BY PROBING YOUR ALTERS--

10:21.889 --> 10:23.824
AND THE ODDS ARE HIGH THAT
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM KNOWS--

10:23.857 --> 10:26.093
THEN EVEN
IF IT'S HARD TO WATCH,

10:26.126 --> 10:27.895
YOU'LL FINALLY KNOW.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.399

10:38.739 --> 10:39.840
>> [clears throat]

10:39.873 --> 10:41.742
[sniffs]

10:41.775 --> 10:44.044
>> SO MR. STUART
CALLED YOU HOT,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.847
SAID YOUR HAIR WAS
TOO PROVOCATIVE FOR DAYTIME.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.916
>> RIGHT.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.786
>> DID MR. STUART EVER MAKE
ANY REQUESTS FOR DATES?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.321
>> ALL THE TIME.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.323
HE ALWAYS WANTED ME TO GO
TO BROOKSTONE

10:56.356 --> 10:58.291
TO CHECK OUT
THE MASSAGE CHAIRS.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.760
>> THAT'S NOT A DATE.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.962
>> WHAT?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.931
>> IT WOULDN'T HOLD UP.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.800
LOOK, MISS GREGSON, IF YOU'RE
CLAIMING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,

11:06.834 --> 11:10.203
IT HAS TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR
THE ADVANCES WERE UNWELCOME.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.340
>> OF COURSE THEY WERE.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.808
>> [sighs]

11:14.842 --> 11:16.243
THE FOOD-SERVICE INDUSTRY

11:16.276 --> 11:18.979
IS A HOTBED
OF SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
IT'S BASICALLY
INSTITUTIONALIZED.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.316
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WORK
AT RESTAURANTS.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.019
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
FOR YOUNG WAITRESSES

11:26.053 --> 11:29.289
TO DEVELOP FEELINGS
FOR THEIR MANAGER.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.024
IT'S OKAY IF YOU BOINKED HIM.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.059
DID YOU BOINK HIM?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.427
>> NO.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.196
I DIDN'T.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.999
[chuckles]
UM, MISS--MISS JACKSON,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.802
I GOT THIS JOB
TO GET SOME EXTRA MONEY,

11:41.835 --> 11:44.004
BECAUSE MY MOTHER
IS VERY, VERY SICK.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.506
I HAVE MUCH BETTER THINGS
TO DO THAN--

11:46.539 --> 11:49.810
THAN SPEND MY TIME
BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP

11:49.843 --> 11:53.113
WITH SOME LOSER GUY
FROM LOSER BARNABEEZ.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.181
NO OFFENSE.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.349
>> I'VE HEARD WORSE.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.853
>> SHOOT.

11:59.887 --> 12:00.988
SHOOT!

12:01.021 --> 12:02.389
>> IT'S REALLY OKAY.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.758
>> IT'S NOT OKAY.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
I WAS ABLE TO BE CO-CONSCIOUS
BEFORE I CAME HERE.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.128
>> YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.429
>> IT'S BEEN FOUR DAYS.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.298
WHY ISN'T
THE HYPNOSIS WORKING?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.100
>> THERE ARE SOME PATIENTS
THAT DON'T RESPOND.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.968
>> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET
TO THE TRUTH AND GET BETTER

12:15.002 --> 12:17.304
IF THE ALTERS WON'T COME OUT
AND TALK TO YOU?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.506
>> THIS IS A PROCESS.
THEY'RE NOT READY.

12:19.539 --> 12:23.010
TARA, AND TO BE FAIR TO THEM,
LOOK, THEY JUST--

12:23.043 --> 12:24.978
THEY JUST MET ME.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.314
>> WELL, I LIKE YOU.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.016
I TRUST YOU.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.819
GOD, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.354
>> THESE ALTERS--THEY USE
TARA'S BODY AS THEY PLEASE,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.223
AND THEN WHEN TARA'S OUT,

12:36.256 --> 12:39.459
SHE SPENDS ALL HER TIME
IN A STATE OF GUILTY OVERDRIVE.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.161
>> I'M SORRY.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.064
UH, BUT YOU KEEP SAYING,
"TARA THIS," AND, "TARA THAT."

12:44.097 --> 12:46.566
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO KEEP OUR
SHARING FOCUSED ON OURSELVES?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.002
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> YEAH.

12:49.036 --> 12:53.106
LIKE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON
DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF YOU.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.407
>> I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT COULD HELP.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.545
>> SO HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR GROUP STUFF?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.280
>> IT'S FANTASTIC.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.849
I'M LEARNING A LOT
ABOUT MYSELF.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.316
>> [laughs]

13:03.350 --> 13:07.554
>> OH, IT'S JUST A LOT
OF USELESS YAMMERING.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.122
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA ENJOY
MEETING PEOPLE

13:09.156 --> 13:11.024
IN MY SITUATION, BUT...

13:11.058 --> 13:12.592
>> YEAH, WELL,
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.862
I'M NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK
BRINGING ANY OF MY ALTERS OUT.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.130
>> I THOUGHT THIS GUY
WAS THE MAN.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.099
AND AT HOME,
WE CAN'T GET THEM TO STAY IN.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.001
>> HEY, IT'S THE DUDE
FROM THE PICTURE

13:21.034 --> 13:22.135
YOU KEEP BY YOUR BED.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.937
>> IS THAT JENNY?
HEY.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.138
>> [whispering]
JENNY'S INTEGRATED.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.007
>> [whispering]
WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.910
>> YOU KNOW HOW SOME PEOPLE
AREN'T HAPPY FOR YOU

13:29.943 --> 13:31.344
WHEN YOU'VE LOST
A BUNCH OF WEIGHT?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.446
>> OH.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.283
THAT--THAT'S AMAZING.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.318
>> WELL...

13:38.351 --> 13:41.221
A LOT OF TIME AND HARD WORK,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.290
LIKE WHAT TARA'S DOING.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.457
>> BUT IT'S DOABLE, RIGHT?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.359
I MEAN, WE CAN FIX THIS.
>> MM-HMM.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.228
>> IT'S NOT LIKE TAKING ME
TO THE DRY-CLEANER'S, MAX.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.229
>> I KNOW.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.131
I KNOW IT'S A PROCESS.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.133
AND DR. HOLDEN SAID
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.234
I GET IT.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.402
>> JUST AS LONG AS IT HAPPENS

13:55.435 --> 13:57.938
BEFORE OUR INSURANCE RUNS OUT.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.008
>> MORNING, FAKE MOM.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.275
>> "MORNSEYS."

14:02.309 --> 14:04.277
>> IS FAKE DAD STILL HERE?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.313
>> NO.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.415
[dryer buzzing]

14:08.448 --> 14:09.883
GUESS WHAT I DID.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.352
I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HIM.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.521
I DIDN'T LET HIM SLEEP OVER

14:14.554 --> 14:16.056
AND...

14:16.089 --> 14:18.191
PERHAPS EXTENDED
THIS LOVELY THING

14:18.225 --> 14:19.226
YET ANOTHER DAY

14:19.259 --> 14:22.462
BY CONTINUING TO TREAT MYSELF

14:22.495 --> 14:25.065
LIKE A SPECIAL PRIZE
HE HAS TO WIN.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.100
>> OH, REALLY?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.069
SO WAS IT YOU

14:29.102 --> 14:31.238
OR THAT SPECIAL PRIZE

14:31.271 --> 14:33.106
THAT WAS HAVING
A SCREAMING ORGASM

14:33.140 --> 14:34.641
AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.376
>> YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.645
HE WAS LONG GONE BY THEN.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.613
>> OH, REALLY?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.149
>> [laughing]
WELL...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.117
I DIDN'T LET HIM SLEEP OVER.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.318
>> OH, MY GOD!

14:45.352 --> 14:47.187
[telephone ringing]

14:47.220 --> 14:49.990
[humming]

14:50.023 --> 14:52.025
>> I'M A SLUT.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.326
HELLO?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.362
>> HEY, IT'S MAX.
>> HEY, MAX.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.402
>> MORE XANAX, MOOSH?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.272
WHAT IS THIS,
ANNA NICOLE SMITH TIME?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.207
SORRY, BUT EVEN IN FAKE LAND,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.109
THIS IS REALLY DONE.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.211
>> IT JUST
MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.346
>> YEAH, BUT IF YOU TAKE A PILL
TO MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.248
THEN YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN THINGS ARE FOULED UP.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.616
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
THINGS ARE FOULED UP,

15:16.649 --> 15:18.118
YOU CAN'T FIX IT YOURSELF.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.519
>> BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW WHAT'S FOULED UP.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.689
>> DO YOU EVEN GET
WHAT MOM'S ALTERS DO?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.424
>> RUIN MY FREAKIN' LIFE?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.425
>> NO.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.594
THEY DO STUFF FOR MOM.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.429
SHE WAS PROTECTING YOU.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.599
JASON IS NOTHING
BUT A BI-CURIOUS CHURCH MONKEY

15:32.632 --> 15:34.467
WHO'S USING YOU
TO FIND SOME EDGE.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.070
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.739
>> OKAY, SO MAYBE
HE WILL DO SOME GUYS,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.474
AND MAYBE YOU CAN GET HIM
TO DO YOU.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.377
BUT HE'S GONNA MARRY A GIRL,

15:44.411 --> 15:47.280
AND HE'S NEVER GONNA LOVE YOU
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

15:47.314 --> 15:51.284
SO T CAME OUT
TO TRY AND PUT A STOP TO IT.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.120
>> YOU SLEPT IN THE TRUCK?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.422
>> YEAH, TOO MANY SIGNIFICANT
OTHERS AT THE RAMADA BAR.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.992
THEY JUST WANT TO TALK
AND SHARE AND STUFF.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.394
>> WELL, WHY AREN'T YOU SHARING
AND STUFF?

16:01.428 --> 16:04.597
>> WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?
WHO WANTS TO HEAR MY STUFF?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.067
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.336
I THINK YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR STUFF,

16:09.369 --> 16:12.172
BECAUSE YOU GOT A LOT OF IT,

16:12.205 --> 16:15.108
AND YOU'RE AFRAID
YOU MIGHT LOSE IT,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.509
AND YOUR VOICE
WILL GET ALL HIGH,

16:16.543 --> 16:18.111
AND YOU'LL SOUND LIKE A WOMAN.
[chuckles]

16:18.145 --> 16:20.347
>> YEAH, RIGHT.
SHUT UP.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.315
HOW ARE THE KIDS?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.517
>> THEY'RE DOING SO GREAT,

16:24.551 --> 16:28.021
I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD STAY
ANOTHER WEEK OR SOMETHING.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.422
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.490
>> GOOD LUCK.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.359
>> THANKS.
[phone beeps]

16:32.392 --> 16:35.462
>> WE'RE BEGINNING TO INJECT
THE MEDICINE INTO YOUR I.V.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.798
YOU'LL NOTICE YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE RELAXED.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.602
OKAY, SO I CAN TELL
THE MEDICINE IS REACHING YOU,

16:42.635 --> 16:45.572
I'D LIKE YOU TO COUNT BACKWARDS
FROM 100 FOR ME.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.042
>> NOW?

16:49.076 --> 16:51.678
>> YEAH, GO AHEAD.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.447
>> 100...

16:54.481 --> 16:58.051

17:04.857 --> 17:06.759
96...

17:06.793 --> 17:08.561
>> VERY GOOD.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.664
I'M WONDERING IF ANYBODY

17:11.698 --> 17:14.601
INSIDE TARA HAS A MEMORY

17:14.634 --> 17:17.170
OF A NIGHT
WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED

17:17.204 --> 17:19.639
WITH TARA
AND A BOY NAMED TRIP.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.310
>> [breathing deeply]

17:23.343 --> 17:26.413
>> CAN ANYONE HELP US
WITH A MEMORY?

17:26.446 --> 17:29.216
>> WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.450
[rock music]

17:30.483 --> 17:31.851
[cheering]

17:31.884 --> 17:34.287
DON'T MESS WITH BUCK!
[laughs]

17:34.321 --> 17:36.189
>> SO, LISTEN, BUCK,

17:36.223 --> 17:38.325
I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THERAPY IN MY OFFICE.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.759
>> OH, YEAH,
I'M DONE WITH THAT.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.328
>> GREAT, WELL,
THEN I'LL JUST--

17:41.361 --> 17:43.363
I'LL JUST HANG
WITH YOU, THEN, OKAY?

17:43.396 --> 17:46.799
>> YOU CAN HANG ALL YOU WANT,
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.568
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.702
OH-OH!
YOU SEE THAT?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.404
LICK IT AND STICK IT.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.406
>> YEAH, LUCKY SHOT.
WHATEVER, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.845
>> LUCKY, HUH?
COCKY SUMBITCH.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.448
>> OOH!
[laughter]

18:01.481 --> 18:04.517
>> I APOLOGIZE
ABOUT MY FOUL TONGUE.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.687
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
MY SPECIAL LADY.

>> [clears throat] IF EVERYBODY
COULD JUST SIGN THIS CARD

18:18.631 --> 18:20.733
FOR TONYA,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.335
AND WHEN SHE COMES BACK,

18:22.369 --> 18:25.472
NO COMMENTS
ABOUT MISSING EYEBROWS.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.374
AND YES, IN CASE ANYONE
IS WONDERING,

18:27.407 --> 18:28.741
WE WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE

THE "SPLOSION" FEATURE.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.482
YOU GUYS GOT ME?

>> YEAH.

>> UH, ONE MORE THING--

18:37.784 --> 18:40.753
IF ANYONE HAS ANYTHING
TO SAY TO ME...

18:42.655 --> 18:45.892
I ASK THAT THEY SAY IT
TO MY FACE.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.494
HAVE A GREAT SHIFT.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.630
>> THANK YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.632
>> I'M GONNA SIGN IT NOW.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.800
>> THAT INCLUDES YOU.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.502
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.904
>> YOU CERTAINLY HAD SOMETHING
TO SAY TO CORPORATE.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.640
I HAVE FRIENDS
ALL OVER BARNABEEZ.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.509
THAT MEANS WHEN THERE'S
SOMETHING SQUIRRELLY

19:02.542 --> 19:04.344
SCOOTING UP THE FLAGPOLE,
I GET A CALL.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.645
>> I THINK YOU GET A CALL

19:05.678 --> 19:07.380
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP
YOUR PACKAGE

19:07.414 --> 19:09.216
OUT OF THE FACE OF EVERY GIRL
THAT WORKS FOR YOU.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.650
>> "PACKAGE" IS NOT
AN ACCEPTABLE WORD

19:10.683 --> 19:12.585
FOR THE WORKPLACE.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.354
YOU GOT THIS JOB

19:14.387 --> 19:17.590
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO GET
OUT OF YOUR CRAZY-ASS HOUSE.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.392
YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR AFFECTION FROM ME.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.394
>> NO, I WAS NOT.
>> AND I WAS THERE FOR YOU.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.530
AND I STILL AM.
>> EW.

CAN YOU JUST STOP ACTING LIKE
