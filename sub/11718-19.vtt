Sorry, brah.

00:22.688 --> 00:25.389
We're all good.

00:25.407 --> 00:26.607
Sorry.
Maybe I just don't get it.

00:26.658 --> 00:27.808
On this island,

00:27.843 --> 00:29.910
when you drop in
on someone's wave,

00:29.945 --> 00:32.729
you cause problems for other
surfers. That's just what happens.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.999
Like everything else
on this island,

00:35.033 --> 00:36.000
that makes zero sense.

00:36.034 --> 00:37.535
Okay, I saw a
wave, I rode it.

00:37.569 --> 00:40.237
If anybody else wants to ride it
with me, they're welcome.

00:40.255 --> 00:42.006
No, you're wrong, okay?

00:42.040 --> 00:45.209
If somebody's on the wave first,
they own the wave.

00:45.243 --> 00:46.293
Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ho!

00:46.345 --> 00:47.795
You can't own a wave.

00:47.846 --> 00:49.847
Certainly not because you
paddle faster than the next guy.

00:49.881 --> 00:50.965
All right,
that's number one.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.416
Number two: I
clearly told the guy

00:52.434 --> 00:53.467
I was coming down on his left.

00:53.518 --> 00:55.019
I said, "Hey, buddy,
I'm on the wave!"

00:55.053 --> 00:56.270
It's the Pacific Ocean.

00:56.304 --> 00:57.938
Danny, it's not a bike path.

00:57.973 --> 00:59.974
Okay, well, I-I think
that the same rules

01:00.025 --> 01:01.692
should apply
for any thoroughfare.

01:01.727 --> 01:03.594
Take it from me, someone who
was not born on this island,

01:03.612 --> 01:05.813
therefore was not raised
with all the mumbo jumbo.

01:05.864 --> 01:07.481
You can't own a wave.

And last but not least,
an appetizer

01:14.289 --> 01:16.907

under any circumstances,

01:16.941 --> 01:19.076

Hey!

01:20.112 --> 01:21.829
There you guys are.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.217
I didn't know your sister
was in town.

01:26.251 --> 01:27.951
- Neither did I.
- Hi.

01:27.969 --> 01:29.953
I've been looking for you two
for over an hour.

01:29.971 --> 01:31.806
You weren't home,
so I figured

01:31.840 --> 01:33.808
I'd check your favorite
little surf spot.

01:33.842 --> 01:35.559
So here I am.

01:35.594 --> 01:36.894
Surprise.

01:36.928 --> 01:38.479
What are you doing here, Mary?

01:38.513 --> 01:39.963
What does it look
like I'm doing here?

01:39.981 --> 01:41.415
It looks like
you're, uh,

01:41.450 --> 01:43.267
going to a Halloween party

01:43.301 --> 01:44.802
dressed as a
flight attendant.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.270
Come on. Seriously.

01:46.304 --> 01:48.305
You're working for the airlines?

01:48.323 --> 01:52.276
Yes! It's the
coolest job ever.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.144
I started like two weeks ago,

01:54.162 --> 01:56.864
and they gave me
the Oahu to New York run.

01:56.915 --> 02:00.084
I'm going to be flying back
and forth like twice a week.

02:00.118 --> 02:01.652
We can hang out
during my layovers.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.837
How sweet is that?

02:02.871 --> 02:05.456
Pretty sweet. Right?

02:05.490 --> 02:06.957
Huh?

02:06.991 --> 02:08.459
Come here.

02:09.377 --> 02:10.877
Hi.

02:10.929 --> 02:12.162
Come on.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.598
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.684
Pick up your board, Danny.

02:16.718 --> 02:18.252
Come on.

02:22.173 --> 02:24.308
Pick it up!

02:30.282 --> 02:33.317
So... so, you guys are, like,
surf buddies now, huh?

02:34.202 --> 02:35.903
Uh, yeah, kind of.

02:36.872 --> 02:38.205
So cute.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.990
Why didn't
you call me?

02:40.024 --> 02:41.292
I could've picked you
up from the airport.

02:41.326 --> 02:42.693
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.

02:42.711 --> 02:43.661
Look at him.

02:43.695 --> 02:45.045
He's definitely surprised.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.046
In a good way.

02:46.081 --> 02:47.498
In a good way.

02:47.532 --> 02:48.999
So a stewardess.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.367
How exactly did that happen?

02:50.385 --> 02:52.586
Uh, well, my friend Angela
worked for the airlines,

02:52.637 --> 02:55.556
and she knew I needed a job,
so here I am.

02:55.590 --> 02:56.924
And, by the way,
we like

02:56.975 --> 02:59.009
- to be called flight attendants.
- I knew that.

02:59.043 --> 03:00.761
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?

03:00.812 --> 03:02.296
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town

03:02.330 --> 03:03.714
for a while?
Actually, no.

03:03.732 --> 03:04.982
I'm working
the return flight

03:05.016 --> 03:07.001
back to New York,
so I got to take a rain check

03:07.035 --> 03:08.369
on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:08.403 --> 03:09.487
You just got here.

03:09.521 --> 03:11.155
I know, but I have to go back
to the hotel

03:11.189 --> 03:12.273
and freshen up
before the flight.

03:12.324 --> 03:14.275
So we'll catch up
next time.

03:14.309 --> 03:16.360
I have so much
to tell you.

03:16.394 --> 03:17.611
But it's all good stuff,
so don't worry.

03:17.662 --> 03:19.780
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.

03:19.814 --> 03:21.565
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys

03:21.583 --> 03:22.750

Yeah.

surf buddies now?

06:00.747 --> 06:02.164
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.

06:02.198 --> 06:03.949
Earlier today,
we got a tip

06:03.983 --> 06:05.868
on one of the
unrecorded lines

06:05.919 --> 06:07.035
that a stewardess
was planning

06:07.070 --> 06:08.320
on smuggling
some contraband

06:08.338 --> 06:09.588
onto a New York
bound flight.

06:09.622 --> 06:11.106
Okay, all right,
this is crazy.

06:11.141 --> 06:12.657
Mary's not a smuggler.

06:12.675 --> 06:14.376
Are you sure you have
the right person?

06:14.427 --> 06:15.878
Commander McGarrett,
your sister

06:15.929 --> 06:18.213
had about $20 million
worth of diamonds

06:18.264 --> 06:19.598
duct-taped to her torso,

06:19.632 --> 06:21.967
so, yeah, I think we got
the right person.

06:22.001 --> 06:24.019
Did she say why
she had the diamonds?

06:24.053 --> 06:25.270
She refused to talk to us.

06:25.305 --> 06:26.388
That's why we called you.

06:26.422 --> 06:27.806
She won't talk to anyone else.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.725
Okay, you said you stopped her
based on a tip.

06:29.759 --> 06:31.577
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.

06:31.611 --> 06:32.628
A male caller.

06:32.662 --> 06:34.947
We tried to trace it,
but he hung up too fast.

06:34.981 --> 06:36.398
It was probably
a prepaid cell anyway.

06:36.449 --> 06:38.350
And is that unusual--
to get a call

06:38.368 --> 06:39.952
out of the blue like that?
No.

06:39.986 --> 06:42.454
We get anonymous tips
about drug mules all the time.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.672
It's usually
a rival group trying

06:43.706 --> 06:44.957
to put the competition
out of business.

06:44.991 --> 06:46.875
All right, listen,
as a professional courtesy,

06:46.910 --> 06:48.977
I'd like to speak
to my sister in private.

07:07.881 --> 07:10.516
What the hell happened?

07:12.485 --> 07:14.937
I went straight to my hotel
when I left you guys,

07:14.988 --> 07:17.105
and there was a man in my room
with a gun.

07:18.024 --> 07:19.441
Okay.

07:19.492 --> 07:21.777
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

07:21.828 --> 07:23.412
No. Don't think so.

07:23.446 --> 07:24.830
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.

07:24.864 --> 07:27.499
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?

07:27.534 --> 07:29.334
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.570
And tell me how you
got away from this guy

07:31.588 --> 07:33.738
and how you ended up
with these diamonds.

07:33.756 --> 07:34.840
I didn't get away.

07:34.874 --> 07:35.874
He taped the diamonds to me,

07:35.908 --> 07:37.259
and he told me
that Angela's dead

07:37.293 --> 07:39.878
if I don't do
exactly what he says.

07:39.912 --> 07:41.129
Okay, who's Angela?

07:41.181 --> 07:43.081
I told you
about her, didn't I?

07:43.099 --> 07:44.716
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.602
We work together
as flight attendants.

07:46.636 --> 07:48.587
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was

07:48.605 --> 07:50.138
your friend before this?
Yes.

07:50.190 --> 07:53.842
We met at yoga class,
like, three months ago.

07:53.877 --> 07:56.812
I mean, she's really, like, the
only real friend that I have.

07:56.863 --> 07:58.780
She helped me get this job.

08:01.484 --> 08:02.618
Steve, I really screwed up.

08:02.652 --> 08:04.036
If I'm not
on that plane

08:04.070 --> 08:06.104
when it lands,
she's going to be killed.

08:06.122 --> 08:07.589
Listen, Mary,
just take a deep breath,

08:07.624 --> 08:10.609
okay, and calm
down, all right?

08:10.627 --> 08:11.943
Now, tell me everything you know

08:11.961 --> 08:13.545
about this guy
who took your friend.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.914
That's the thing, is I don't
know anything about him,

08:15.948 --> 08:17.499
but he knew everything about me.

08:17.550 --> 08:18.950
He was in my room waiting.

08:18.968 --> 08:21.086
Okay, well, can you describe
this guy to me?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.287
Yeah. He was tall.

08:22.305 --> 08:23.305
He had dark skin.

08:23.339 --> 08:24.456
He had a deep voice.

08:24.474 --> 08:25.624
He had an accent.

08:25.642 --> 08:27.476
Wasn't European,
but similar.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.094
You're positive
you've never

08:29.128 --> 08:30.462
seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.980
I've never seen him, okay?

08:32.015 --> 08:33.398
Why do you keep asking me that?

08:33.433 --> 08:34.850
Because it's not
adding up, Mary.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.152
You understand? Like, I'm trying
to put this thing together,

08:37.186 --> 08:38.736
but it doesn't... it
doesn't make sense to me.

08:38.770 --> 08:39.804
Like, why would
they take you?

08:39.822 --> 08:41.573
Okay, and why
would you not call me

08:41.607 --> 08:43.158
the minute
you got away from him?

08:43.192 --> 08:45.477
'Cause I was terrified.

08:47.163 --> 08:48.614
I still am, Steve.

08:48.648 --> 08:51.483
He took a picture of me
on his cell phone,

08:51.501 --> 08:54.419
and he told me that he's
going to text his partner,

08:54.454 --> 08:56.255
and that when I land,

08:56.289 --> 08:58.924
this guy's going to text me
instructions.

08:58.958 --> 09:00.926
He did that to keep you scared
and cooperating, you understand?

09:00.960 --> 09:03.629
Well, it's working.

09:04.547 --> 09:06.632
I can't believe

09:06.666 --> 09:08.100
I'm in this mess now.

09:08.134 --> 09:11.103
Steve, if I'm not on that plane
in nine hours with the diamonds,

09:11.137 --> 09:13.004
Angela's going to be killed.

09:14.857 --> 09:16.441
That's not
going to happen, Mary.

09:16.476 --> 09:17.976
Because that plane took off
half an hour ago.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.027
You understand?

09:19.062 --> 09:20.696
Which means we got

09:20.730 --> 09:23.848
nine hours to save your friend.

09:29.622 --> 09:31.473
We'll find her, Mary, all right?

09:34.494 --> 09:36.461
Hey. We'll find her.

09:36.496 --> 09:38.630
Okay?

09:45.504 --> 09:46.960
We need to find
this Angela.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.779
- Yes. If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.

09:49.191 --> 09:50.658
I think I'd know
if she was lying.

09:50.692 --> 09:51.776
Okay.

09:51.810 --> 09:53.361
All right,
what are you getting at?

09:53.395 --> 09:55.363
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother--

09:55.397 --> 09:56.964
right?-- and he
lied to me,

09:56.999 --> 09:58.849
and now he's on
the FBI Most Wanted list.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.151
No offense,
but I think I'm

10:00.185 --> 10:02.036
a little closer to my sister
than you were to your brother.

10:02.070 --> 10:04.522
Okay, so then you know
she was arrested

10:04.540 --> 10:06.524
two months ago
for drunk driving?

10:06.558 --> 10:09.043
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?

10:09.077 --> 10:10.411
No, I didn't run
background

10:10.462 --> 10:11.996
on your sister;
TSA did,

10:12.030 --> 10:13.414
and I am relaying information.

10:13.465 --> 10:14.632
Okay, well,
holding back the fact

10:14.666 --> 10:15.917
that she got arrested
two months ago

10:15.968 --> 10:17.701
does not mean that she's lying
to us today.

10:17.719 --> 10:19.220
I'm not saying she's lying,

10:19.254 --> 10:21.305
maybe just not telling us
the full story.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.707
Okay, look, we're going to check
that hotel room,

10:23.725 --> 10:25.026
then we're going to know more.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.710
Until then,
I'm going on the assumption

10:26.728 --> 10:28.045
that she's telling me the truth.

10:28.063 --> 10:29.397
Okay.

10:36.488 --> 10:37.989
Hey.

10:38.023 --> 10:41.192
Hey. So the room hasn't been
serviced, so it should be

10:41.226 --> 10:43.561
in the same condition as
when your sister checked out.

10:43.579 --> 10:45.896
Well, so far, we have no signs
of a forced entry,

10:45.914 --> 10:47.582
struggle, or a girl
named Angela.

10:47.616 --> 10:49.667
Okay, well, it doesn't mean
it didn't happen

10:49.701 --> 10:51.002
and she doesn't exist, right?

10:51.036 --> 10:52.537
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well,

10:52.571 --> 10:55.072
the hotel staff said that Mary
was the only one issued with

10:55.090 --> 10:57.174
a room key, and nobody saw her
with another woman.

10:57.209 --> 10:59.627
But I did confirm
that Mary has a co-worker

10:59.678 --> 11:01.262
named Angela Branson
who flew in with her.

11:01.296 --> 11:02.763
She's based out of New York
and isn't due

11:02.788 --> 11:03.988
to fly out again for three days.

11:04.016 --> 11:05.583
And according to
the hotel records,

11:05.601 --> 11:06.968
there was a room
booked in her name,

11:07.019 --> 11:08.135
but she never
actually checked in.

11:08.186 --> 11:09.920
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.

11:09.938 --> 11:11.856
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?

11:11.890 --> 11:13.391
The airline gave us
her cell phone number,

11:13.425 --> 11:15.443
but it's just rolling straight
to voicemail whenever we try it.

11:15.477 --> 11:16.978
Well, if she'd been kidnapped,

11:17.029 --> 11:19.263
that would make
sense, right?

11:19.281 --> 11:21.215
Okay, are you trying
to convince us or yourself?

11:22.150 --> 11:24.268
Maybe a little of both.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.242
Okay.

11:31.276 --> 11:34.295
We need to get a look
at this security feed.

11:39.751 --> 11:41.118
Okay, that's him.

11:41.136 --> 11:44.221
That's the guy
Mary described.

11:44.256 --> 11:45.923
He's got Angela.

11:45.958 --> 11:47.141
Stop. Push in.

11:47.175 --> 11:48.792
All right, so he brings
Angela down the back way

11:48.810 --> 11:50.177
so no one can see him.

11:50.228 --> 11:52.179
Danny, call Kono,
have her pick Mary up

11:52.230 --> 11:53.931
from the TSA's custody,
and drop her in my office,

11:53.965 --> 11:55.399
but tell her
I want it done low-key.

11:55.434 --> 11:57.351
For Angela's safety,
we can't let anybody know

11:57.402 --> 11:59.904
that Mary and the diamonds
didn't make that flight.

12:01.957 --> 12:04.609
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?

12:04.643 --> 12:06.077
Please! We're not gonna
be able to help anybody

12:06.111 --> 12:08.613
if we end up wrapped
around a telephone pole.

12:08.647 --> 12:10.831
That anonymous call about Mary
and the diamonds...

12:12.751 --> 12:14.535
...it doesn't add up.
There are a lot

12:14.586 --> 12:16.987
of things about this case that
do not add up, and I apologize

12:17.005 --> 12:18.039
for not believing
Mary's story,

12:18.090 --> 12:19.590
but please stop driving this car

12:19.625 --> 12:21.676
like it's stolen, and slow down!

12:21.710 --> 12:23.377
Driving like I always do.

12:25.464 --> 12:27.932
Listen, whoever made the
call to TSA about Mary

12:27.966 --> 12:29.800
had to have been a part
of the smuggler's operation.

12:29.834 --> 12:32.670
Right? That's the only way
that they would have known

12:32.704 --> 12:34.355
that Mary had
the diamonds on her.

12:34.389 --> 12:35.806
Okay, we don't know
who made the call,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.225
but maybe Kono got a chance
to enhance that video,

12:38.276 --> 12:40.111
and we will get an I.D.
on her kidnapper.

12:40.145 --> 12:41.979
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.

12:42.013 --> 12:43.864
I said please don't
do it, please...

12:48.620 --> 12:51.972
I just threw up in my mouth
a little bit. Thank you.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.084
You okay?
Yeah.

13:03.135 --> 13:04.452
All right.

13:04.486 --> 13:06.387
Okay, Kono,
tell me something good.

13:06.421 --> 13:08.872
All right, well, the rest
of the security videos

13:08.890 --> 13:09.974
don't show much.

13:10.008 --> 13:11.542
They only have coverage
of the stairwell,

13:11.560 --> 13:13.310
so there's no actual
footage of anyone

13:13.345 --> 13:14.662
going in or out of
that specific room.

13:14.696 --> 13:15.763
But we got footage of Angela

13:15.797 --> 13:17.047
being dragged down
the back stairwell.

13:17.065 --> 13:19.183
What about the, uh,
facial recognition thingie?

13:19.217 --> 13:20.735
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.

13:20.769 --> 13:22.269
There's not enough
to get a complete scan.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.854
Okay, uh, Chin, what about
the origin of the diamonds?

13:23.888 --> 13:25.156
I checked through Interpol.

13:25.190 --> 13:27.608
There's no reports of any
diamond shipments this size,

13:27.659 --> 13:29.076
either missing
or stolen.

13:29.111 --> 13:31.495
The good news is that Angela's
safe as long as they believe

13:31.530 --> 13:33.364
that Mary and the diamonds
are on that plane.

13:33.398 --> 13:35.232
Well, I hate to be the one
that states the obvious.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.985
She is not on the plane, so,
we're gonna have a big problem

13:38.019 --> 13:39.437
in about eight hours,
when it lands.

13:39.471 --> 13:40.855
Okay, maybe, maybe.

13:40.889 --> 13:41.789
What do you mean?

13:41.840 --> 13:42.906
I got plan--
it might be a goofy

13:42.924 --> 13:44.842
plan-- but what if,
what if we get Mary

13:44.876 --> 13:46.293
and those diamonds
on the governor's G-4?

13:46.344 --> 13:49.079
In the next half an hour, we can
beat that plane to New York.

13:49.097 --> 13:50.914
When the guy there approaches
her and takes possession

13:50.932 --> 13:52.466
of the diamonds,
we snatch him for smuggling.

13:52.517 --> 13:54.201
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him,

13:54.236 --> 13:56.437
then we can roll back and arrest
whoever's holding Angela.

13:56.471 --> 13:58.022
Okay, Kono,
get the governor on the phone.

13:58.056 --> 13:59.724
We need that plane ready,
fueled to go

13:59.758 --> 14:01.058
in a half an hour.
Please call HPD,

14:01.092 --> 14:03.060
and tell them we need those
diamonds here immediately.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.919
42-30? 42-30, come in.

14:11.953 --> 14:14.238
Go for 42-30.

14:14.272 --> 14:15.890
Per the watch commander,

14:15.924 --> 14:17.458
start heading towards
Iolani Palace.

14:17.492 --> 14:20.277
See Detective Williams
for an evidence transfer.

14:20.295 --> 14:22.079
42-30. Copy that.

14:22.113 --> 14:24.548
Evidence transfer?

14:24.583 --> 14:26.083
What the hell's that about?

15:18.921 --> 15:20.672
Hey. Hey, look,

15:20.723 --> 15:23.007
just so there's no confusion,
this is HPD's handle,

15:23.058 --> 15:24.592
not Five-O's.

15:24.626 --> 15:26.144
Well, most people like
to start the day off

15:26.178 --> 15:27.295
with some pleasantries,

15:27.313 --> 15:29.314
but not the new
chief of detectives, huh?

15:29.348 --> 15:31.099
You do know
that that

15:31.133 --> 15:32.901
transport van contained evidence
from a case we were working?

15:32.935 --> 15:34.569
I've already been briefed
on the kidnapping case.

15:34.603 --> 15:36.637
The murder of my two cops
trumps it-- come on.

15:36.655 --> 15:38.156
- Okay, listen to me...
- Detective Kelly?

15:38.190 --> 15:39.258
...you do know
that the only people

15:39.259 --> 15:41.352
who knew the diamonds were
in that van were cops.

15:41.353 --> 15:42.737
All right, so if you're gonna
start looking for the hijacker,

15:42.738 --> 15:44.789
you start with HPD.

15:45.663 --> 15:47.765
Hey, look, no way in hell.

15:47.799 --> 15:49.683
I cleaned house.

15:49.718 --> 15:52.086
I'll bet my job none of
my guys are involved.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.271
Hey, they just ran
the plate on that semi.

15:54.306 --> 15:56.107
It was reported
stolen last night.

15:58.226 --> 16:00.144
Okay, if they stole
the semi truck last night,

16:00.178 --> 16:03.197
they already knew the diamonds
were going to be seized today.

16:03.231 --> 16:04.865
All right, who would have
known something about that?

16:04.900 --> 16:06.901
The guy who called in
the anonymous tip on Mary.

16:06.952 --> 16:08.285
But if they were always
gonna steal the diamonds,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.454
why wouldn't they just snatch
Mary when she arrived

16:10.489 --> 16:11.705
at the airport?

16:11.740 --> 16:13.324
Because they were more afraid
of the diamond smugglers

16:13.358 --> 16:14.458
than they were of us.

16:14.493 --> 16:17.694
Let's make 'em worry about us.

16:18.696 --> 16:20.214
<i>Mary, we need to determine</i>

16:20.248 --> 16:22.666
who may have targeted you
to smuggle those diamonds.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.502
So, was there
anyone new

16:24.536 --> 16:26.420
that either you
or Angela had met?

16:26.471 --> 16:29.140
Maybe an overfriendly
passenger?

16:29.174 --> 16:30.374
No. Nobody.

16:30.392 --> 16:32.343
How long have you known Angela?

16:32.377 --> 16:35.546
We met a few months back
at this yoga club in New York.

16:35.564 --> 16:37.681
And she's the one
that helped me get this job.

16:37.715 --> 16:39.683
Oh, my God.

16:39.717 --> 16:42.102
This could be from the people
that have Angela.

16:42.154 --> 16:44.271
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said

16:44.322 --> 16:46.991
I was gonna get a text message
from his guy in New York.

16:47.025 --> 16:48.692
What does it say?

16:48.726 --> 16:51.829
"When you land, walk directly
to baggage carousel three.

16:51.863 --> 16:54.415
"I'll be watching, so don't try
and involve the cops,

16:54.449 --> 16:56.500
or your friend's... dead."

16:56.535 --> 16:58.752
Good news is,
they still have no idea

16:58.787 --> 17:00.237
Mary didn't make that plane.

17:00.272 --> 17:02.256
Yeah, looks like we got about
five hours till they find out.

17:02.290 --> 17:03.874
All right,
when you get those diamonds,

17:03.908 --> 17:06.527
we can use them as a bargaining
chip for Angela's life.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.963
Hey, I've been thinking
about these diamonds.

17:08.997 --> 17:11.415
If these guys just
came in possession

17:11.433 --> 17:13.550
of 20 million in ice, they need
to move it through a broker.

17:13.585 --> 17:15.553
If they are still
on the island.

17:15.587 --> 17:17.555
Yeah, but these guys killed
two cops to get these stones,

17:17.589 --> 17:18.888
so they know we're watching
everyone leaving the island.

17:18.923 --> 17:20.424
The smartest thing
these guys can do is

17:20.442 --> 17:22.643
to try and move those diamonds
while they're still here.

17:22.694 --> 17:24.528
Right, and as far as
brokers go, there's only

17:24.563 --> 17:26.696
so many guys on the island that
can handle this kind of weight.

17:26.731 --> 17:28.531
Now this is a
criminal file

17:28.567 --> 17:31.368
on a fence released from
prison six months ago.

17:33.738 --> 17:35.239
If there's a deal
he'll have heard about it.

17:35.273 --> 17:39.743
<i>So, this guy's been</i>
<i>off the radar since he finished</i>

17:39.777 --> 17:41.662
serving his sentence
six months ago.

17:41.713 --> 17:42.863
You got new leverage
on him?

17:42.898 --> 17:44.048
Nothing. No parole.

17:44.082 --> 17:45.883
Did his full 30-year
term, dropped his tail.

17:45.917 --> 17:47.218
Doesn't mean
he's not dirty.

17:47.252 --> 17:49.303
In my experience, once a crook,
you are always a crook.

17:49.337 --> 17:50.504
I agree.

17:53.791 --> 17:56.844
August March. HPD.

17:56.895 --> 17:58.795
We need to ask you
a few questions.

17:58.813 --> 18:00.047
Nobody here by that name.

18:00.081 --> 18:01.315
Have you tried next door?

18:01.349 --> 18:03.017
You lie to me again,

18:03.068 --> 18:06.687
you're going straight
back to jail.

18:07.522 --> 18:09.857
You know, last
time I checked,

18:09.908 --> 18:12.026
you needed a
man's invitation

18:12.060 --> 18:13.961
to walk into his house.

18:13.995 --> 18:15.162
That rule applies
to citizens.

18:15.196 --> 18:16.813
You stopped being one
30 years ago.

18:16.831 --> 18:18.616
30 years... Well,

18:18.650 --> 18:20.868
maybe you should talk
to my attorney about what

18:20.902 --> 18:22.703
my rights are...
You finish making that call...

18:22.754 --> 18:24.088
Yeah?
You are going to jail.

18:24.122 --> 18:25.589
Either way, you're gonna
answer my questions, because...

18:25.624 --> 18:26.874
You-you can't...

18:26.908 --> 18:28.092
- ...I don't have time for your games.
- No, no.

18:28.126 --> 18:29.126
You understand me?
You understand me?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.294
Yeah, well,
I certainly

18:30.328 --> 18:31.462
won't answer
your questions...

18:31.496 --> 18:33.380
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.

18:33.431 --> 18:35.349
Why don't you pull
it back a little bit?

18:35.383 --> 18:36.951
All right? This
guy's done his time.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.719
Why don't you
just take it easy?

18:38.770 --> 18:41.555
All right, I'm not holding
nothing back, McGarrett.

18:41.606 --> 18:44.007
I got two dead cops. Two.

18:44.025 --> 18:45.342
And I'm betting
that this old man

18:45.360 --> 18:47.027
knows who's responsible, okay?

18:47.062 --> 18:48.479
Now don't be fooled

18:48.513 --> 18:49.730
by the way he looks.

18:49.781 --> 18:53.067
August March ran one of
the largest smuggling networks

18:53.118 --> 18:54.952
in the world.

18:54.986 --> 18:58.973
<i>He</i> was <i>the fence</i>
<i>for stolen art and gems.</i>

18:59.007 --> 19:01.825
<i>Nothing moved</i>
<i>on or off Honolulu</i>

19:01.859 --> 19:04.695
<i>without August March taking</i>
<i>a piece of the action.</i>

19:04.713 --> 19:06.413
<i>His operation and pipeline</i>

19:06.464 --> 19:08.799
<i>continued long after</i>
<i>he was in prison</i>

19:08.833 --> 19:13.504
<i>for ordering the murder of two</i>
<i>of his business associates.</i>

19:13.538 --> 19:15.306
<i>They made the mistake</i>
<i>of trusting him,</i>

19:15.340 --> 19:17.591
<i>and they got a bullet for it.</i>

19:17.642 --> 19:21.562
<i>The man is</i>
<i>a cold-blooded killer.</i>

19:21.596 --> 19:26.150
It's a very colorful, but
less-than-accurate description

19:26.184 --> 19:27.518
of what I was

19:27.552 --> 19:28.936
convicted of.

19:28.987 --> 19:32.139
Whatever crimes I committed
in the past are just that.

19:32.173 --> 19:33.273
The past!

19:33.325 --> 19:36.410
Now, please leave me alone,

19:36.444 --> 19:38.829
or I'm gonna file a complaint!

19:38.863 --> 19:41.031
Listen, there's a woman
whose life is in danger.

19:41.065 --> 19:44.251
All we need is a little bit
of your time and some help

19:44.285 --> 19:47.371
with the smuggler
that we're looking for, okay?

19:47.405 --> 19:50.874
I'm sorry,
but I don't do that anymore.

19:50.908 --> 19:52.843
I've been on ice
for 30 years.

19:52.877 --> 19:56.180
I'm not in that business
anymore.

19:56.214 --> 19:57.414
Okay, but you do know people

19:57.432 --> 19:58.749
that are in that business,
correct?

19:58.767 --> 20:00.083
Yeah, I do,

20:00.101 --> 20:01.635
and unlike you guys,

20:01.686 --> 20:04.254
they take me at my word
when I say I'm out.

20:04.272 --> 20:06.056
All we're trying
to do is prevent

20:06.090 --> 20:08.025
an innocent woman
from being killed

20:08.059 --> 20:10.761
over the theft
of a few lousy diamonds here.

20:11.696 --> 20:13.814
This is about diamonds?

20:13.865 --> 20:15.932
Yes. Do you know anything
about it?

20:15.950 --> 20:18.602
I might.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.537
But if I help you,

20:20.572 --> 20:22.206
you've got to give me your word

20:22.240 --> 20:24.041
that you'll never
bother me again.

20:24.075 --> 20:28.028
And nobody must know
about my involvement.

20:28.946 --> 20:31.081
You have my word.

20:31.115 --> 20:32.666
Well...

20:32.717 --> 20:34.284
I'm not just talking about you.

20:34.302 --> 20:35.636
Look,

20:35.670 --> 20:37.638
you give me the guys

20:37.672 --> 20:39.673
that killed my men...

20:39.724 --> 20:41.058
Yeah?

20:41.092 --> 20:43.310
...you will never, never

20:43.344 --> 20:45.529
lay eyes on me again.

20:48.016 --> 20:50.267
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

20:50.301 --> 20:52.686
I got a call yesterday

20:52.737 --> 20:54.772
from a stranger.

20:54.806 --> 20:58.158
I don't know who he is,
nor who referred him to me.

20:58.193 --> 21:01.278
But he said he
wanted to fence...

21:01.312 --> 21:03.247
s-some diamonds.

21:03.281 --> 21:05.332
Yeah, uh...

21:05.366 --> 21:07.284
It's, it's
the last number on there.

21:07.318 --> 21:09.286
Maybe you can
trace the number.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.871
Okay.

21:15.276 --> 21:18.995
Did I hear right,
that your name's McGarrett?

21:19.013 --> 21:20.330
Yeah.

21:20.348 --> 21:23.100
There was a young
officer named McGarrett

21:23.134 --> 21:25.102
who transported me
to jail 30 years ago.

21:25.136 --> 21:26.286
Any relation?

21:26.321 --> 21:28.055
Yeah, that was
my father. Yeah.

21:28.106 --> 21:29.857
No kidding.

21:29.891 --> 21:33.009
Small world.
How's he doing?

21:33.027 --> 21:34.678
He's dead.

21:34.696 --> 21:37.481
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.

21:37.515 --> 21:39.283
He was a good man.

21:39.317 --> 21:41.151
I tried to offer him...

21:41.185 --> 21:44.004
$100,000 bribe that day.

21:44.038 --> 21:46.990
A fortune at that time.

21:47.024 --> 21:48.876
My father wasn't
that kind of cop.

21:48.910 --> 21:51.027
But there were plenty of cops

21:51.045 --> 21:52.212
around him

21:52.247 --> 21:54.131
who would've taken that money,
right, Chief?

21:54.165 --> 21:56.032
It's a pre-paid.

21:56.050 --> 21:57.200
Can't trace it.

21:57.218 --> 21:58.469
Thank you.

21:58.503 --> 22:00.003
I'm-I'm sorry.

22:00.037 --> 22:01.204
I tried.

22:01.222 --> 22:02.840
I wish I could help you more.

22:02.874 --> 22:05.509
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.

22:05.543 --> 22:07.811
Call that guy back.

22:07.846 --> 22:09.930
Set up a meet
and let me grab him.

22:09.981 --> 22:12.232
- Give him to me. Just give him to me.
- No!

22:12.267 --> 22:14.151
Come on.
That's a young man's game.

22:14.185 --> 22:17.154
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.

22:17.188 --> 22:18.939
This is probably
the only chance we have

22:18.990 --> 22:21.692
to get this girl back safe.

22:44.599 --> 22:46.133
This guy better show.

22:46.184 --> 22:48.585
Plane lands in New York
in less than four hours.

22:49.771 --> 22:51.772
I got him.

22:51.806 --> 22:54.975
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.

22:57.612 --> 23:00.547
He's strapped. Butt of a gun
sticking out of his shirt.

23:00.582 --> 23:02.699
If March gets compromised,

23:02.734 --> 23:03.951
that guy pulls out that gun,

23:03.985 --> 23:06.153
every single one of these
civilians is at risk here.

23:06.204 --> 23:07.454
This guy's an old pro.

23:07.488 --> 23:08.906
He'll do fine.

23:08.940 --> 23:10.541
Let's hope your right.

23:15.446 --> 23:16.780
August March?

23:17.665 --> 23:19.216
Take a seat.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.169
You're making
the waiter nervous.

23:23.504 --> 23:24.721
By yourself, right?

23:24.756 --> 23:26.423
Because if not,
anything happens,

23:26.457 --> 23:29.142
you're the first to get shot.

23:30.345 --> 23:32.346
Relax, kid.

23:32.397 --> 23:34.298
I'm here
for one piece of business.

23:34.332 --> 23:36.299
The only thing that's
gonna happen here today,

23:36.317 --> 23:38.168
is you and me
are gonna get rich.

23:38.202 --> 23:41.638
Just remember, we wait for
him to inspect the diamonds.

23:41.656 --> 23:43.106
That's the arrest signal.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.525
- That is when we move in.
- You sure you can

23:45.577 --> 23:46.610
move this kind of weight?

23:46.644 --> 23:47.828
Eh, don't worry.

23:47.862 --> 23:49.746
I got the connections.

23:49.781 --> 23:51.640
Whoever sent you
to me knows that.

23:51.665 --> 23:52.282
Good.

23:52.283 --> 23:55.435
So what's the brokerage fee
on 20 million worth?

23:57.772 --> 23:59.790
Well, as I told you
on the phone,

23:59.824 --> 24:02.359
I can't say without
seeing the quality

24:02.393 --> 24:04.428
of the product.
Y-You did bring

24:04.462 --> 24:06.129
all of the diamonds
like I told you.

24:06.163 --> 24:08.298
You didn't really think
I'd be dumb enough

24:08.332 --> 24:10.166
to bring all of them, did you?

24:15.056 --> 24:16.223
Nobody said you were dumb.

24:16.274 --> 24:17.858
But...

24:17.942 --> 24:19.309
without seeing all of them

24:19.343 --> 24:21.061
I can't estimate

24:21.112 --> 24:23.113
the overall quality

24:23.147 --> 24:24.865
of the product.

24:24.899 --> 24:27.217
For all I know,

24:27.251 --> 24:29.440
you could've handpicked
the best one.

24:29.465 --> 24:30.237
I didn't.

24:30.238 --> 24:32.188
Now! Move out!

24:33.291 --> 24:35.042
I've got 200 more
of that same quality.

24:35.076 --> 24:36.526
Now how much?

24:36.544 --> 24:37.694
You say you're not dumb,

24:37.712 --> 24:39.713
but with what you've
been handling lately,

24:39.747 --> 24:42.332
the moves you've been making,

24:42.366 --> 24:43.917
I'm starting to
think you are.

24:43.968 --> 24:47.421
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?

24:47.472 --> 24:50.974
In my day, we would've
never done a thing like that.

24:51.009 --> 24:52.709
Brings too much heat.

24:52.727 --> 24:54.828
How'd you know about the cops?

25:19.587 --> 25:21.254
Nice shot, Fryer.

25:21.289 --> 25:23.073
Trouble is now

25:23.091 --> 25:24.407
our only lead is dead.

25:35.298 --> 25:36.449
You okay.

25:37.324 --> 25:39.542
I should've kept my mouth shut.

25:39.576 --> 25:42.004
I told your partner
I was too old for this.

25:42.005 --> 25:43.007
March was telling me
he thinks

25:43.008 --> 25:44.392
he can identify
where the diamonds are from.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.128
Okay, that's good. How?

25:46.162 --> 25:48.830
Every diamond
has a distinct marking.

25:48.864 --> 25:51.299
If I could look at this stone

25:51.334 --> 25:53.085
this guy brought
under a microscope,

25:53.136 --> 25:55.337
I might be able
to tell you something about it.

25:55.371 --> 25:57.756
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's,

25:57.807 --> 25:59.707
we have a microscope
for you to look at, okay?

25:59.725 --> 26:01.643
Fine, fine, fine.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.741
I mean...

26:04.766 --> 26:06.366
Now, look, I just did what
I had to do, all right?

26:06.482 --> 26:08.100
And besides, this guy
matches the description

26:08.134 --> 26:09.484
of the evidence van
hijacker, okay?

26:09.519 --> 26:11.319
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?

26:11.354 --> 26:14.573
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.108
Okay, what?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.909
His name's Darryl Kaleo.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.780
Brother of an ex-cop
you put away last year

26:21.831 --> 26:23.698
for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.

26:23.732 --> 26:26.234
Are you implying
that he's involved with this?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.786
Hey, look, he's
capable of killing cops.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.588
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.072
He's in a life term.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.541
Doesn't mean he's
not behind this.

26:32.575 --> 26:34.376
You think that he just
orchestrated this whole thing?

26:34.410 --> 26:36.962
From jail? Why? What does he get out
of it? Just helping his brother?

26:37.013 --> 26:37.725
Doesn't make sense.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.334
Why don't we pay him
a visit and find out.

26:39.549 --> 26:41.850
He's easy to find.

26:46.022 --> 26:49.007
Life is pretty good here

26:49.041 --> 26:50.809
in the Protective
Custody Wing, right?

26:50.860 --> 26:52.944
One of the perks
of being a cop.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.212
Ex-cop.

26:54.247 --> 26:55.714
You should be walking
the main line

26:55.748 --> 26:57.816
with the rest of these
lowlifes, and you know it.

26:57.867 --> 27:01.069
My prior law enforcement
work makes me a target.

27:01.103 --> 27:02.937
Is there a reason you two

27:02.955 --> 27:05.773
are tossing my place
or did you just miss me?

27:06.542 --> 27:07.876
You two have

27:07.910 --> 27:09.711
no legal authority
to be shaking me down.

27:09.745 --> 27:11.213
- This is harassment.
- You're in prison.

27:11.247 --> 27:15.000
Subject to search
whenever and wherever.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.636
Why are you really here? I know
you're looking for something.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.138
Why bother lying?

27:20.173 --> 27:21.673
Okay.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.642
I will play along.

27:23.676 --> 27:24.759
Your brother...

27:24.793 --> 27:27.262
he robbed a transport van,
killed two cops.

27:27.296 --> 27:28.680
You already know that,

27:28.714 --> 27:29.981
don't ya? Huh?

27:30.016 --> 27:31.066
Listen, Kaleo,

27:31.100 --> 27:32.984
we know that you helped
set this thing up,

27:33.019 --> 27:35.654
and we are here to prove that--
that's what we're gonna do.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.606
Be my guest.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.407
Okay.
You know, Williams...

27:39.442 --> 27:41.159
What?
You mentioning

27:41.194 --> 27:45.647
my brother makes me
nostalgic about family.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.148
You got a kid, right?

27:47.166 --> 27:49.984
How's she doing,
anyway?

27:50.002 --> 27:53.004
My daughter is doing fine.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.623
Thank you.

27:54.657 --> 27:57.008
Your brother Darryl,
on the other hand,

27:57.043 --> 28:00.011
he's not doing so good.
He's dead.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.197
Hey.

28:02.231 --> 28:04.916
Look what we got here.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.554
Cell phone.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.357
You planted that.
It ain't mine.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.759
I'm sure your prints
are gonna be all over it.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.528
So tell me...

28:16.562 --> 28:18.897
is this how you arranged
the transport van's hijacking?

28:18.948 --> 28:20.181
It is, isn't it?

28:20.199 --> 28:23.851
You got questions,
run them by my lawyer.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.337
Okay, no problem.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.021
Listen, um,...

28:27.039 --> 28:29.574
you know, last time I saw you...

28:29.625 --> 28:32.327
I broke a couple of
bones in your face, right?

28:32.361 --> 28:34.195
You ever mention
my daughter again...

28:34.213 --> 28:36.531
I promise you
I'm gonna come back here,

28:36.549 --> 28:39.334
I'm gonna break every single
bone in your body, okay?

28:39.368 --> 28:41.720
You understand?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.838
Put him back in his cage.

28:52.515 --> 28:55.600
Interesting.

28:56.719 --> 28:59.104
This explains

28:59.155 --> 29:01.723
why these diamonds were
never reported missing.

29:01.741 --> 29:03.858
Based on quality,

29:03.892 --> 29:05.744
I would say...

29:05.778 --> 29:07.829
that this stone comes from

29:07.863 --> 29:09.781
the Republic of Liberia.

29:09.832 --> 29:12.400
Are you sure?
Things change.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.730
I mean, you've been
locked up for 30 years.

29:13.731 --> 29:16.705
30 years, 13 million years,
this is an allotrope

29:16.706 --> 29:18.906
of carbon formed
at high pressure

29:18.924 --> 29:21.376
and high temperature conditions.

29:21.410 --> 29:23.428
That never changes.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.130
This stone, my dear,

29:25.181 --> 29:26.581
comes from Africa.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.884
Which leads me to believe
that is is probably...

29:29.918 --> 29:31.853
a conflict diamond.

29:31.887 --> 29:33.421
Blood diamonds...

29:33.439 --> 29:36.224
sold on the black market,

29:36.258 --> 29:38.026
and used to finance civil wars

29:38.060 --> 29:40.428
and genocide
on the Africa coast.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.264
Have you ever done business
with people from Liberia?

29:43.282 --> 29:44.366
No, no.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.767
But...

29:45.785 --> 29:48.870
I'm a student
of the game.

29:48.904 --> 29:52.273
The game never changes.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.376
Just the players do.

29:54.410 --> 29:55.710
Well, then that
would explain

29:55.745 --> 29:58.463
the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.749
And that's why, if I were you,

30:00.783 --> 30:03.918
I would check out Liberians
here on temporary visas.

30:03.952 --> 30:05.286
Okay.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.223
We really appreciate the help.

30:08.257 --> 30:10.592
This at least gives us
an idea of who's holding Angela.

30:10.626 --> 30:11.676
I wish you luck.

30:11.727 --> 30:15.313
And feel free to call
on me anytime.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.298
Bye.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.733
Mr. March.

30:18.768 --> 30:20.652
Hmm?

30:20.686 --> 30:23.271
I'm gonna need
that diamond back.

30:23.305 --> 30:25.139
The diamond?!

30:30.830 --> 30:33.981
Here we go.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.634
Can't blame a guy for trying.

30:39.288 --> 30:41.656
<i>All the outbound calls</i>

30:41.674 --> 30:44.075
off of Kaleo's cell phone
are to his brother Darryl...

30:44.110 --> 30:45.093
with the exception

30:45.127 --> 30:46.094
of this one.

30:46.128 --> 30:47.262
Okay, who's this one to?

30:47.296 --> 30:48.296
TSA security line.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.965
Hey, look at
the time stamp.

30:50.999 --> 30:52.884
30 minutes before
Mary was arrested.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.353
So Kaleo made the call
that got Mary arrested

30:55.388 --> 30:57.472
and the diamonds seized.

30:57.506 --> 30:59.173
He told him the description
of the van,

30:59.191 --> 31:01.025
the route,
so they could hijack it.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.111
But the part of the puzzle
we don't have is how they know

31:03.145 --> 31:04.612
about the Liberian smuggling
operation in the first place.

31:04.647 --> 31:06.514
I reached out to TSA.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.783
I worked up a list of Liberians

31:08.818 --> 31:10.452
that are on the island

31:10.486 --> 31:12.287
on temporary visas.

31:12.321 --> 31:13.671
It's not extensive.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.707
That's him.

31:15.741 --> 31:16.908
Bottom left.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.493
That's the guy
that kidnapped Angela.

31:19.528 --> 31:22.380
Jordan Nevins.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.632
He landed on the island
three days ago.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.501
Okay, well,

31:26.535 --> 31:28.837
it looks like he didn't
lie on his TSA entry form.

31:28.871 --> 31:30.839
Just confirmed he's staying
in the penthouse suite.

31:30.873 --> 31:32.707
Let's go pay him a visit.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:33.893 --> 31:35.527
Whoa, whoa!

31:35.561 --> 31:36.711
What are you doing?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.346
Getting my vest.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.731
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?

31:39.765 --> 31:41.549
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve,

31:41.567 --> 31:43.034
come on over here a second.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.036
What are you talking about?

31:48.908 --> 31:49.991
What is that?

31:50.025 --> 31:51.192
That <i>was</i>
your birthday cake.

31:51.226 --> 31:53.244
I was planning on taking it
by the office.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.396
Got sidetracked by this case.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.414
Is that why

31:56.449 --> 31:57.415
you guys all stopped talking

31:57.450 --> 31:58.950
when I came in the
office this morning?

31:59.001 --> 32:01.786
Yeah. Like usual, you figured out
a way to ruin everything.

32:01.837 --> 32:02.987
Thanks.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.746
It's butter cream.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.666
Butter cream's my favorite.

32:16.802 --> 32:17.902
Move in!

32:17.937 --> 32:18.853
Hey, hey!

32:18.888 --> 32:20.755
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.

32:28.096 --> 32:30.532
All clear.

32:30.566 --> 32:32.317
Bedroom's clear; no girl.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.735
All right, where's Angela?

32:33.769 --> 32:35.102
I-I don't know...

32:35.120 --> 32:36.237
Hey! Where's Angela?

32:36.271 --> 32:38.790
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:38.824 --> 32:42.076
All right, we'll see about that.

32:47.363 --> 32:49.531
<i>I'm a Liberian citizen.</i>

32:49.565 --> 32:51.199
If you lay a finger on me,

32:51.233 --> 32:53.285
I will have the consulate
crawling so far up your...

32:53.336 --> 32:54.619
That's a good idea.

32:54.670 --> 32:56.371
And afterwards, I
can tell your bosses

32:56.405 --> 32:58.373
that you lost
their diamond shipment.

32:59.842 --> 33:03.211
You seized some diamonds?

33:03.245 --> 33:05.263
That look familiar?

33:05.298 --> 33:07.382
It would take
less than an hour

33:07.416 --> 33:09.250
for me to prepare
a press release

33:09.268 --> 33:12.604
announcing the seizure of
20 million in conflict diamonds.

33:12.638 --> 33:13.889
You know, it's funny,

33:13.923 --> 33:15.223
there's something about
your body language right now

33:15.257 --> 33:18.593
that tells me that if that
press release hits,

33:18.611 --> 33:20.445
you're gonna feel safer
in here with us

33:20.480 --> 33:22.347
than you are out
there on the street.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.935
If I tell you everything,

33:26.953 --> 33:28.453
you gotta protect me

33:28.488 --> 33:32.541
and a promise
of no deportation.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.960
I'll be a dead man
if you send me back to Liberia.

33:34.994 --> 33:35.911
You got it.

33:35.945 --> 33:37.462
Where's the girl?

33:37.497 --> 33:38.914
I have no idea.

33:38.948 --> 33:41.166
After our little charade
at the hotel,

33:41.217 --> 33:43.084
we parted ways.

33:44.170 --> 33:47.138
What are you talking
about-- "charade"?

33:48.140 --> 33:49.474
Angela faked her own kidnapping?

33:49.509 --> 33:51.510
We didn't have a choice.

33:51.561 --> 33:53.595
Angela was bumped
from the flight

33:53.629 --> 33:55.129
at the last minute.

33:55.147 --> 33:56.515
Let me guess,
you had already told

33:56.566 --> 33:58.850
the people in New York
the diamonds were on the flight.

33:58.901 --> 34:00.318
I'm a facilitator.

34:00.353 --> 34:02.270
I am paid to deliver

34:02.304 --> 34:05.974
the product to a buyer
at a specific date and time.

34:05.992 --> 34:07.742
And if that doesn't happen...

34:07.777 --> 34:09.610
People like you get killed.

34:09.645 --> 34:11.947
They had to, uh,

34:11.981 --> 34:14.315
use the other girl
to make the drop as scheduled.

34:15.985 --> 34:20.255
The other girl was my sister.

34:20.289 --> 34:21.989
Did you know?

34:22.007 --> 34:23.174
It was Angela's idea

34:23.259 --> 34:25.793
to scare her into doing it.

34:28.681 --> 34:30.047
So, Angela and you

34:30.099 --> 34:31.266
worked together before?

34:31.300 --> 34:32.500
Yes.

34:32.518 --> 34:34.835
She made several runs for me
in the last few months,

34:34.853 --> 34:36.521
but nothing
as large as this.

34:36.556 --> 34:38.723
This is the first time
for the both of us.

34:38.774 --> 34:42.761
You've been played.

34:44.530 --> 34:45.563
Angela probably set Mary up,

34:45.614 --> 34:46.898
so when the diamonds
didn't get there,

34:46.949 --> 34:47.949
she wouldn't be blamed.

34:47.984 --> 34:50.201
You and my sister Mary did.

34:50.235 --> 34:51.686
No...

34:51.704 --> 34:55.623
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.042
She's not smart enough

34:57.076 --> 34:59.494
to come up with something
like this on her own.

35:01.380 --> 35:03.632
Maybe she met somebody who was.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.166
So, what was the plan?

35:05.200 --> 35:06.217
You were gonna use

35:06.252 --> 35:08.303
your share of the dough
to make an appeal?

35:08.337 --> 35:10.255
Bribe a judge?
What?

35:10.306 --> 35:11.706
It was worth a try.

35:11.724 --> 35:13.341
Okay.

35:13.375 --> 35:14.476
Where's Angela?

35:14.510 --> 35:15.594
She's in the wind.

35:15.645 --> 35:17.312
Where she lands,

35:17.346 --> 35:19.180
your guess is as good as mine.

35:19.214 --> 35:20.482
Okay,

35:20.516 --> 35:21.983
how did she hook up
with Darryl?

35:22.018 --> 35:23.184
She's his ex-old lady.

35:23.218 --> 35:24.719
She reached out to him
with an opportunity

35:24.737 --> 35:27.055
to make a big score.

35:27.073 --> 35:29.157
She just didn't want
to get killed doing it.

35:29.191 --> 35:31.743
And your brother turned
to you for advice?

35:31.777 --> 35:32.761
Advice?

35:32.795 --> 35:34.529
Guess you could call it that.

35:34.563 --> 35:38.399
I just figured a way for her
and my brother to get rich.

35:40.402 --> 35:42.287
All right, well,
I'm gonna charge you

35:42.338 --> 35:44.089
with the death
of those two cops.

35:44.123 --> 35:46.574
What you just said,
coupled with the phone records

35:46.592 --> 35:47.826
gives us enough--
more than enough--

35:47.860 --> 35:49.711
to prove that you orchestrated
the whole thing.

35:50.596 --> 35:52.714
I'm doing life without,

35:52.748 --> 35:55.133
and there's no death penalty
here in Hawaii.

35:55.184 --> 35:57.218
Sorry to disappoint you,

35:57.252 --> 35:59.938
but another case is not going
to make a difference to me.

35:59.972 --> 36:00.805
That might be true,

36:00.856 --> 36:01.940
but since you've killed

36:01.974 --> 36:03.308
two more cops,

36:03.359 --> 36:06.227
you have lost your right to
be housed in protective custody.

36:06.261 --> 36:07.929
Isn't that true?

36:08.748 --> 36:10.431
It is, it's true.

36:10.449 --> 36:12.867
And...
believe me, uh,

36:12.902 --> 36:14.653
when you meet
your new cell mate,

36:14.704 --> 36:17.288
life is going to get
very interesting.

36:17.323 --> 36:19.407
Wait, you can't do that.

36:19.441 --> 36:21.026
Yes I can;
I just did.

36:22.495 --> 36:24.846
Stand up.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.100
Turn around, Sunshine.

36:30.169 --> 36:31.452
Cuff him.

36:36.792 --> 36:40.428
Hey... dead man walking.

36:58.948 --> 37:02.133
♪ ♪

37:15.414 --> 37:17.832
I feel so stupid.

37:17.850 --> 37:19.768
Mary, this happens
to all of us.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.437
I mean, people we think
we can trust tell us lies.

37:22.471 --> 37:24.739
I know, but I thought
she was my friend.

37:26.609 --> 37:28.676
Look, Angela's gonna
resurface eventually.

37:28.694 --> 37:31.345
She's gonna try to fence
those diamonds.

37:31.363 --> 37:33.198
And when she does,
Interpol and the FBI

37:33.232 --> 37:34.449
are gonna be waiting for her.

37:34.483 --> 37:36.201
It's only a matter
of time, Mary.

37:36.235 --> 37:38.536
She's on every country's
watch list.

37:42.024 --> 37:43.541
Wow.

37:43.576 --> 37:45.076
All right, well, what-what now?

37:45.127 --> 37:46.411
What about me?

37:46.462 --> 37:47.629
You move on.

37:47.663 --> 37:48.880
You pick yourself up.

37:48.914 --> 37:50.582
You learn from your mistakes.

37:52.668 --> 37:55.203
I honestly don't even know
what to do with myself.

37:55.221 --> 37:57.371
I... I liked that job.

37:57.389 --> 38:00.008
You know, I
finally felt like

38:00.042 --> 38:02.427
I was starting a new chapter
in my life.

38:02.478 --> 38:04.979
Well, you'll be happy to know

38:05.014 --> 38:06.881
that that chapter's
still open for you.

38:06.899 --> 38:08.650
What do you mean?

38:08.684 --> 38:11.186
I spoke to the airline.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.887
They know you're a victim
in all this.

38:12.905 --> 38:14.388
Your job's there if you want it.

38:14.406 --> 38:16.357
It is?

38:16.392 --> 38:17.575
Yeah.

38:17.610 --> 38:18.860
Really?

38:18.894 --> 38:20.445
Yeah, really.

38:20.479 --> 38:21.780
Thank you.

38:21.831 --> 38:23.397
You're welcome.

38:25.835 --> 38:28.569
I'm sorry.

38:28.587 --> 38:30.571
Okay.

38:30.589 --> 38:33.124
If you two are done draining
each other emotionally,

38:33.175 --> 38:37.011
I have something I have to
show you, if you got a minute.

38:37.897 --> 38:40.715
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:40.749 --> 38:42.801
♪ Cha cha cha ♪

38:42.852 --> 38:46.437
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

38:46.472 --> 38:47.639
♪ Cha cha cha ♪

38:47.690 --> 38:50.758

38:50.776 --> 38:53.928
♪ Big Kahuna ♪

38:53.946 --> 38:58.883
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

39:01.770 --> 39:03.321
All right.

39:03.355 --> 39:04.939
That's an awesome cake.

39:06.125 --> 39:08.026
We were gonna jump out
and yell surprise,

39:08.060 --> 39:09.627
but then we figured
what's the use?

39:10.713 --> 39:12.247
Well, you should never
surprise a man

39:12.281 --> 39:13.915
who is armed and who has
extensive close-quarter

39:13.949 --> 39:14.999
battle training, anyway.

39:15.050 --> 39:16.801
Ah, that's good to keep in mind.

39:16.836 --> 39:19.053
I will also remember that.

39:20.055 --> 39:21.506
Wow.
Here you go,

39:21.557 --> 39:23.424
- birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, buddy.

39:23.459 --> 39:25.310
Thank you.

39:25.344 --> 39:26.460
Guys, listen, I think

39:26.478 --> 39:28.012
we should just
face the fact,

39:28.063 --> 39:30.682
that I'm not that easy
to surprise.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.016
You know?

39:41.143 --> 39:42.310
Surprise!

39:45.080 --> 39:46.397
Better than butter cream, right?

39:48.651 --> 39:50.034
No, I'm good, thank you.

39:50.085 --> 39:52.203
Okay.

39:54.456 --> 39:57.625
So, I'd never heard
anything like it before.

39:57.659 --> 39:59.961
<i>They said salt cake,</i>
<i>I said, "What's the plan?"</i>

40:20.065 --> 40:23.067
I'm delighted you
reached out to me, Angela.

40:23.118 --> 40:24.652
I didn't have many options.

40:24.686 --> 40:26.905
But with your help,
this actually worked out

40:26.989 --> 40:28.289
better than I hoped.

40:28.324 --> 40:29.824
Your diamonds.

40:29.858 --> 40:31.542
It's been a pleasure.

40:31.577 --> 40:34.629
Oh, believe me,
the pleasure's all mine.

40:36.048 --> 40:37.832
But there's one more thing
you need to learn

40:37.866 --> 40:40.885
about this type of business.

40:41.570 --> 40:43.087
As I said before...

40:43.138 --> 40:46.824
never turn your back
on the buyer.
