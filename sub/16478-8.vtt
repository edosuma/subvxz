Dustin, get up.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.463
Come with me.

00:16.334 --> 00:17.899
What's wrong?

00:17.901 --> 00:20.902
Stay inside and not a sound.

00:20.904 --> 00:22.770
Is this a game?
Dustin...

00:22.772 --> 00:25.941
I need you to be brave.

00:32.015 --> 00:33.348
Where is it?!

00:33.350 --> 00:34.582
You can't be in my house!

00:34.584 --> 00:36.516
Shut up! Where did you hide it?!

00:37.987 --> 00:39.086
Get out of my house!

00:40.122 --> 00:41.688
I'm gonna call the cops!

00:41.690 --> 00:44.124
You are not... calling anyone!

Hey there.

01:34.673 --> 01:35.773
Hi.

01:35.775 --> 01:38.542
- I'm Melody.
- Uh-huh.

01:38.544 --> 01:40.644
I hate diaper changes
as much as you do, bud.

01:42.215 --> 01:44.047
You are...?

01:45.483 --> 01:47.650
Really confused right now.

01:47.652 --> 01:48.885
Percy.

01:51.356 --> 01:52.588
What are you doing here?

01:52.590 --> 01:55.158
Um... excuse me.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.793
We've got a case nearby.

01:56.795 --> 01:58.694
I told Pride I'd swing around
and pick you up.

01:58.696 --> 02:00.195
Well, you should've called.

02:00.197 --> 02:01.530
I did call and text,

02:01.532 --> 02:02.898
so...

02:02.900 --> 02:04.300
I guess I hadn't
checked my phone.

02:04.302 --> 02:05.467
Oh, he's been a little busy.

02:05.469 --> 02:06.501
Tucker's been having
a hard time

02:06.503 --> 02:08.037
adjusting to his new home.

02:10.674 --> 02:14.476
Oh, Melody, this is Sonja Percy,
my co-worker.

02:14.478 --> 02:17.178
And, uh, Percy, this is...

02:17.180 --> 02:19.047
Melody. We...

02:19.983 --> 02:21.549
...well...

02:21.551 --> 02:24.385
Aw, we have a son
together, yes.

02:24.387 --> 02:25.753
A son?

02:25.755 --> 02:27.922
Yeah, Tucker.

02:29.125 --> 02:30.091
Yeah.

02:30.093 --> 02:31.225
You got questions.

02:31.227 --> 02:33.127
So many...

02:33.129 --> 02:34.761
but we got a case

02:34.763 --> 02:36.296
right now, so...

02:36.298 --> 02:38.731
yeah.

02:40.936 --> 02:42.402
Hi.

02:42.404 --> 02:44.338
Guess I better get going.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.738
You think you'll be gone long,
Christopher?

02:45.740 --> 02:46.773
Ah, well...

02:46.775 --> 02:48.976
I don't know. Sorry.

02:48.978 --> 02:50.410
I'll call you
later, all right?

02:51.412 --> 02:53.045
Hey.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.525
Bye.

03:11.164 --> 03:12.397
You okay?

03:12.399 --> 03:14.065
Peachy.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.666
'Cause you didn't say a word
on the way over here.

03:15.668 --> 03:16.767
Don't have any words.

03:17.904 --> 03:19.204
I should've
told you sooner.

03:19.206 --> 03:20.838
Which you said a dozen
times in the car.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.540
You don't have to.
I'm not mad.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.242
Really?
You seem mad.

03:24.244 --> 03:26.410
No. It's your private life,
nothing to do with work

03:26.412 --> 03:27.511
and it's none
of my business.

03:27.513 --> 03:28.745
Okay...

03:28.747 --> 03:29.813
Just like it's none
of my business

03:29.815 --> 03:30.780
you told everyone else

03:30.782 --> 03:31.815
on the team

03:31.817 --> 03:32.849
about your love child except me.

03:32.851 --> 03:33.850
Doesn't mean a thing.

03:33.852 --> 03:34.818
We're good.

03:34.820 --> 03:37.587
So, wait...

03:37.589 --> 03:39.723
you are mad.

03:39.725 --> 03:41.058
NOPD got

03:41.060 --> 03:43.459
a domestic disturbance call
last night.

03:43.461 --> 03:45.328
Neighbor heard screaming.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.796
Patrol found Petty Officer
Heather Cobb dead.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.566
She's a member
of the Commodores,

03:50.568 --> 03:52.135
the Navy Jazz Band.

03:52.137 --> 03:53.569
Think this simple burglary
went aggravated?

03:53.571 --> 03:55.838
This is more than just
a burglary.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.740
This place is
turned upside down.

03:57.742 --> 03:59.107
Suspect searching
for something specific?

03:59.109 --> 04:00.842
Whatever the killer
was looking for,

04:00.844 --> 04:02.710
our victim didn't want it found.

04:02.712 --> 04:03.845
She has defensive wounds

04:03.847 --> 04:06.181
on her forearm, hands...

04:06.183 --> 04:07.482
Pre-mortem bruising

04:07.484 --> 04:08.517
and contusions

04:08.519 --> 04:11.319
on torso, throat, face.

04:12.456 --> 04:13.688
Put up a fight.

04:13.690 --> 04:14.923
Sadly, not a good enough one.

04:14.925 --> 04:16.156
It's too soon to tell,

04:16.159 --> 04:17.591
but I'm guessing
blunt force trauma

04:17.593 --> 04:19.026
as cause of death.

04:20.262 --> 04:23.064
King, check this out.

04:23.066 --> 04:24.498
What'd you find?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.633
Master bedroom's on the other
end of the hall.

04:26.635 --> 04:27.935
Yeah, so?

04:27.937 --> 04:29.403
Who was sleeping in this bed?

04:29.405 --> 04:31.539
Maybe someone else was
staying in the house?

04:31.541 --> 04:33.339
Spread out and look around.

04:34.142 --> 04:35.141
Hey, Gregorio.

04:35.143 --> 04:36.809
Hey.
Nice of you to stop by.

04:36.811 --> 04:38.111
Well, FBI's
still my day job.

04:38.113 --> 04:39.279
You guys are
more of a hobby.

04:39.281 --> 04:40.213
What'd I miss?

04:40.215 --> 04:41.281
One victim upstairs dead.

04:41.283 --> 04:42.782
Possible second victim

04:42.784 --> 04:44.451
made it out of the house.
We're gonna search

04:44.453 --> 04:45.518
the area.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.520
You're with me.

04:47.522 --> 04:48.654
You know, ever
since we plucked

04:48.656 --> 04:49.755
that Ciudad Natal
accountant

04:49.757 --> 04:50.922
out of the bayou,

04:50.924 --> 04:51.890
D.C.'s been turning

04:51.892 --> 04:53.024
the screws on Isler

04:53.026 --> 04:54.025
to try to get indictments

04:54.027 --> 04:55.194
on the cartel.

04:55.196 --> 04:56.128
And Isler's been turning

04:56.130 --> 04:57.362
the screws on you.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.730
That's the way
the game works.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.898
Not everywhere.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.567
Yeah, well,
Isler wants to find

05:01.569 --> 05:03.068
the cartel embeds
in New Orleans

05:03.070 --> 05:04.603
before Thanksgiving.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.238
That means you'll be in town
for the holiday?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.772
Gives me an excuse
to avoid family.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.674
Yeah, well...

05:10.676 --> 05:12.009
always got a place

05:12.011 --> 05:14.078
at my Thanksgiving table
if you...

05:15.681 --> 05:17.081
...if you want it.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.083
Don't expect me to cook.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.518
You can always bring pie.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.154
Sebastian.
Yeah?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.387
What are you doing here?

05:24.389 --> 05:25.422
I'm gathering evidence.

05:25.424 --> 05:26.889
Crime scene's
inside the house.

05:26.891 --> 05:27.924
Or is it?

05:27.926 --> 05:29.392
Check this out.

05:29.394 --> 05:31.128
So, I found this door.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.529
Thought maybe it was
the killer's entry point

05:32.531 --> 05:34.531
except...
it was unlocked

05:34.533 --> 05:36.533
and broken from the inside.

05:36.535 --> 05:38.535
Now, that's when
I also noticed what...

05:38.537 --> 05:40.237
- Looks like footprints.
- Exactly.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.870
Now, these tracks lead either

05:41.872 --> 05:43.172
to a locked gate
over here...

05:43.174 --> 05:45.407
Yeah?
...or to this door over here.

05:45.409 --> 05:46.775
Under the house?

05:46.777 --> 05:48.777
Yeah. You guys are good
at this, you know that?

05:48.779 --> 05:50.446
- Hey, you want to check it out?
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:50.448 --> 05:52.348
Thank you.
Get Percy and Lasalle.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.550
Oh, okay, I'll get
Percy and Lasalle.

06:13.102 --> 06:16.270
No, no! <i>No! No!</i> Don't hurt me!

06:16.272 --> 06:17.811
Please don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me, please!

06:17.812 --> 06:18.306
Oh. Hey.

06:18.307 --> 06:19.939
No! No!
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:19.941 --> 06:21.141
- No, it's all right. It's all right.
- Don't hurt me.

06:21.143 --> 06:22.442
We're not gonna hurt you.
Please.

06:22.444 --> 06:24.344
It's okay.

06:24.346 --> 06:26.946
I promise. You're safe now.

06:40.256 --> 06:42.523
<i>He say anything?</i>

06:42.547 --> 06:44.314
Other than
his name is Dustin,

06:44.316 --> 06:46.615
and his mom's in the Navy?
I went to

06:46.617 --> 06:48.750
Heather Cobb's house
to get him some clean clothes.

06:48.752 --> 06:50.252
According to neighbors,
that's her nephew,

06:50.254 --> 06:52.121
and he's been staying with her.

06:52.123 --> 06:53.822
Well, it makes sense.

06:53.824 --> 06:56.025
Mom's deployed at the
Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan.

06:56.027 --> 06:57.726
She's on her way back now.

06:57.728 --> 06:59.094
Dad's deceased.

06:59.096 --> 07:00.829
Contact Child
Protective Services?

07:00.831 --> 07:04.132
Yup. Got 'em to grant us
custody until his mom returns.

07:04.134 --> 07:06.600
I want eyes on him.
He might be our only witness

07:06.602 --> 07:08.102
to Heather Cobb's murder.

07:09.639 --> 07:13.107
Here you go.

07:18.515 --> 07:21.714
Could you take... them...?

07:21.716 --> 07:23.417
Sweet potato pancakes.

07:23.419 --> 07:25.685
After you eat,
maybe we can, uh...

07:25.687 --> 07:29.189
talk about what happened, okay?

07:30.725 --> 07:32.792
But take... take your time.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.862
If he doesn't
eat them, I will.

07:36.864 --> 07:38.597
Yeah. Always make extra.

07:38.599 --> 07:41.534
Got to say, I'm gonna miss
your cooking... and your coffee.

07:41.536 --> 07:43.302
FBI coffee is swill.

07:43.304 --> 07:45.637
That sounds like a good-bye.

07:45.639 --> 07:49.275
Cartel case is gonna close
or blow up soon.

07:49.277 --> 07:50.976
Either way, I'm out of here.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.646
You okay, kid?

07:55.648 --> 07:58.550
Dustin?

08:00.253 --> 08:02.920
Is this for asthma?

08:03.890 --> 08:06.091
Dustin, we're gonna
take care of you

08:06.093 --> 08:09.127
till your mom comes home, okay?

08:09.129 --> 08:10.527
Okay.

08:10.529 --> 08:12.762
Hey, King? I think
we got something.

08:12.764 --> 08:15.299
<i>Canvassed</i>

08:15.301 --> 08:16.700
Heather Cobb's neighborhood.

08:16.702 --> 08:18.368
Absolutely nothing
suspicious last night.

08:18.370 --> 08:20.137
But several people did see

08:20.139 --> 08:21.972
a white Jeep driving down her
street the last couple weeks.

08:21.974 --> 08:24.608
- Well, someone get a license plate?
- That's the thing.

08:24.610 --> 08:25.542
Jeep has no plates.

08:25.544 --> 08:26.710
We put a BOLO out anyway.

08:26.712 --> 08:27.843
Mysterious white Jeep.

08:27.845 --> 08:29.245
Heather Cobb's beaten to death,

08:29.247 --> 08:32.347
her house ransacked,
her nephew traumatized.

08:32.350 --> 08:34.217
- Why?
- Well, we're

08:34.219 --> 08:36.952
still not sure, 'cause
Heather was a straight arrow.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.655
Masters
from Berklee College of Music,

08:39.657 --> 08:41.524
played trumpet in
the Navy Jazz Band,

08:41.525 --> 08:43.126
and in her free time,
she taught the kids

08:43.128 --> 08:44.959
at Crescent City Music Academy.

08:44.961 --> 08:47.095
Yeah, basically,
she was Mary Poppins.

08:47.097 --> 08:48.730
Well, someone wanted her dead.

08:48.732 --> 08:50.599
Let's dig into her life.

08:50.601 --> 08:53.168
You two talk to the Navy Band,
I'll hit the music academy.

08:53.170 --> 08:55.137
We're on it.

08:55.139 --> 08:57.172
Yeah. I need to get this.

08:57.174 --> 09:00.008
Melody. Yeah, I can't
really talk right now.

09:00.010 --> 09:02.009
What?

09:02.011 --> 09:03.810
How does someone
lose a remote?

09:03.812 --> 09:05.979
Short leash,
Country Mouse.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.949
Okay.

09:08.951 --> 09:10.684
Hey, uh,

09:10.686 --> 09:12.219
I got to head out.

09:12.221 --> 09:14.321
Can you watch Dustin for me?
No, I can't.

09:14.323 --> 09:16.457
Isler just called,
and by the sound of it,

09:16.459 --> 09:19.725
sounds like he wants me back
at FBI full-time.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.128
What?

09:22.130 --> 09:24.464
You make me go through
that stack of résumés again?

09:25.112 --> 09:26.665
Thought you'd be around
a little bit longer.

09:26.689 --> 09:28.118
Hey, if it was up to me...

09:28.142 --> 09:29.569
Well, what if it was?

09:33.753 --> 09:35.602
I got a space on my team.

09:35.603 --> 09:37.736
If you want it, it's yours.

09:37.738 --> 09:40.373
Join NCIS?

09:40.375 --> 09:43.642
That's a really nice offer.

09:44.946 --> 09:47.413
But I got a job, you know?

09:48.783 --> 09:50.682
Duty calls.

09:50.684 --> 09:53.351
Well, why don't you think
about it at least, huh?

09:53.353 --> 09:56.654
I'm flattered, really,
and as fun as it's been,

09:56.656 --> 09:59.958
this was always
gonna be temporary, you know?

10:15.408 --> 10:18.275
You and me, kid.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.129
<i>Well, it's been weeks</i>
<i>since the attack.</i>

10:40.131 --> 10:42.332
I'm not sure why
NCIS is here now.

10:42.334 --> 10:44.466
What attack
are <i>you</i> talking about?

10:44.468 --> 10:45.733
Petty Officer Gordon.

10:45.735 --> 10:47.402
Former second trumpet.

10:47.404 --> 10:49.371
Broke my arm with a chair.

10:49.373 --> 10:51.673
We're here
about Heather Cobb.

10:51.675 --> 10:53.741
She was murdered last night.

10:53.743 --> 10:56.611
I can't believe it...

10:56.613 --> 10:58.080
We're wondering
if you know of anyone

10:58.082 --> 10:59.640
who might've wanted
to do her harm.

10:59.664 --> 11:00.449
Yes.

11:00.450 --> 11:01.915
The same man who did this to me.

11:01.917 --> 11:03.717
Petty Officer Gordon.
He was in line

11:03.719 --> 11:05.686
to be first trumpet.
But when Heather auditioned,

11:05.688 --> 11:08.155
she blew him away.
It was no contest.

11:08.157 --> 11:08.957
So you gave her the job.

11:08.958 --> 11:11.126
Guessing Petty Officer Gordon
didn't agree with that.

11:11.127 --> 11:13.461
He never gave Cobb
a moment's peace.

11:13.463 --> 11:15.162
Harassed her during rehearsals

11:15.164 --> 11:17.430
and after hours.
Cobb complained to me,

11:17.432 --> 11:19.032
I decided to have him
transferred.

11:19.034 --> 11:21.001
And that's when he
attacked you?

11:21.003 --> 11:22.768
Ending his Navy career.

11:22.770 --> 11:24.604
Giving him even more of a reason

11:24.606 --> 11:26.402
to have it
out for Heather Cobb.

11:26.403 --> 11:29.443
Petty Officer Gordon doesn't drive a
white Jeep, does he?

11:29.444 --> 11:31.844
As a matter of fact, he does.

11:31.846 --> 11:34.679
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

11:34.681 --> 11:37.149
I've been studying these
crime scene photos for hours.

11:37.151 --> 11:38.750
Shouldn't you be
processing evidence?

11:38.752 --> 11:40.119
I did already.
All the DNA

11:40.121 --> 11:41.920
and fingerprints
from the crime scene

11:41.922 --> 11:43.622
all belong to Heather or Dustin.

11:43.624 --> 11:46.191
And the only trace I came up
with was a foreign dirt sample

11:46.193 --> 11:47.692
in the kitchen sink.
I'm running that

11:47.694 --> 11:49.194
through the Mass Spec right now.
What doesn't

11:49.196 --> 11:50.699
make sense
in the crime scene photos?

11:50.723 --> 11:51.497
Just...

11:51.498 --> 11:53.364
L-Look at this mess. I mean,

11:53.366 --> 11:55.099
the killer must've been
searching for something.

11:55.101 --> 11:57.768
NOPD said all her possessions
were accounted for.

11:58.871 --> 12:00.571
Oh, man. It's so obvious.

12:00.573 --> 12:02.806
I've... I've been staring
at it this whole time.

12:02.808 --> 12:04.075
What are you talking about?

12:04.077 --> 12:05.476
Heather was a trumpeter
in the Navy Band, right?

12:05.478 --> 12:07.445
Mm-hmm.
Okay. So...

12:07.447 --> 12:09.746
Where's the trumpet?

12:09.748 --> 12:11.581
It's not in the house.
So you think

12:11.583 --> 12:13.517
Petty Officer Cobb was murdered

12:13.519 --> 12:15.419
for her trumpet?

12:15.421 --> 12:17.254
Yeah. That sounds
really stupid, doesn't it?

12:17.256 --> 12:19.456
It's an interesting theory.

12:19.458 --> 12:22.759
But I found actual evidence

12:22.761 --> 12:24.161
in Heather's fingernails.

12:24.163 --> 12:27.530
Skin cells that may belong
to the killer.

12:27.532 --> 12:30.099
Okay, right. Yeah, sure. Just...

12:30.101 --> 12:31.833
analyze the epidermis.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.936
What's going on?

12:36.074 --> 12:37.940
A few weeks ago,

12:37.942 --> 12:39.841
I was abducted,

12:39.843 --> 12:42.110
forced to break an international
criminal out of prison,

12:42.112 --> 12:44.112
and then helped bring him
and the kidnappers

12:44.114 --> 12:46.747
to justice, right?

12:46.749 --> 12:49.284
Today, I'm your friendly
neighborhood lab monkey

12:49.286 --> 12:51.386
analyzing nail scrapings.

12:51.388 --> 12:53.288
You don't enjoy the lab anymore,
Sebastian?

12:53.290 --> 12:56.391
No. I do. I do, it's just...

12:57.194 --> 12:59.060
Is that all there is for me?

12:59.062 --> 13:01.261
I have stomach contents.

13:03.765 --> 13:06.133
I'll come back for those.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.939
<i>Crescent City Music Academy.</i>

13:14.376 --> 13:17.443
Your Aunt Heather worked
at a pretty cool place, huh?

13:17.445 --> 13:19.312
Dustin!

13:22.350 --> 13:23.849
I'm glad you're okay.

13:23.851 --> 13:26.452
I am so sorry about your aunt.

13:26.454 --> 13:28.254
We'll all miss her very much.

13:28.256 --> 13:29.997
And you must be
Special Agent Pride.

13:30.021 --> 13:30.790
Yes, ma'am.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.658
- You know Dustin?
- Of course!

13:32.660 --> 13:34.993
One of our most talented
young musicians.

13:34.995 --> 13:38.396
Thank you. I'll be inside.

13:38.398 --> 13:39.964
He's a student here?

13:39.966 --> 13:41.433
He didn't tell you?

13:41.435 --> 13:43.368
Well, he has...

13:43.370 --> 13:45.303
hasn't been doing
a lot of talking.

13:45.305 --> 13:47.839
That's our Dustin.

13:47.841 --> 13:49.221
How long has he been
at your school?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.708
Uh, a couple years.

13:50.709 --> 13:53.710
Heather brought him to us.
He's... He's a true prodigy.

13:53.712 --> 13:55.629
Had you noticed anything out of
the ordinary with Heather?

13:56.048 --> 13:58.649
I can't say. Been
distracted these days.

13:58.651 --> 14:00.751
We've got a huge construction
project on the grounds.

14:00.753 --> 14:03.120
Some kind of virus that has half
my students out sick.

14:03.122 --> 14:04.355
Thanksgiving coming up.

14:04.357 --> 14:06.423
Just... a lot.

14:06.425 --> 14:07.279
Mr. Garcia.

14:07.303 --> 14:09.303
I don't mean
to interrupt, but...

14:09.794 --> 14:12.094
Theo and I were
discussing how to modify

14:12.096 --> 14:14.430
the construction schedule
so that his trucks

14:14.432 --> 14:16.393
don't disturb the children
during school hours.

14:16.394 --> 14:16.830
Ah...

14:16.834 --> 14:18.601
I'd appreciate that, Mr. Garcia.
Those trucks have been

14:18.603 --> 14:20.470
moving in and out all morning.
Yeah.

14:20.472 --> 14:22.138
I'll-I'll take care of it.
We were just running

14:22.140 --> 14:23.640
behind schedule and I figured
I could make up some time...

14:23.642 --> 14:26.141
- Just apologize, Theo.
- Um...

14:26.143 --> 14:27.672
Sorry, Ms. McGuire.
Won't happen again.

14:27.696 --> 14:28.911
Thank you.

14:28.912 --> 14:31.680
Again, I'm... I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

14:31.682 --> 14:34.049
Uh, especially with
Ms. Cobb's death.

14:35.786 --> 14:38.387
Mr. Garcia and his
son Mario are new

14:38.389 --> 14:39.921
to the Academy.

14:39.923 --> 14:41.222
He was gracious enough to donate

14:41.224 --> 14:43.291
a new state of the
art auditorium.

14:43.293 --> 14:45.393
Construction's been a bit
of a nightmare, but...

14:45.395 --> 14:47.228
That's very generous.

15:22.697 --> 15:24.730
This is Petty Officer
Gordon's Jeep.

15:24.732 --> 15:26.332
Probably went down Royal.

15:26.334 --> 15:27.799
Shouldn't be too far away.

15:29.403 --> 15:31.069
You look tired.

15:31.071 --> 15:33.304
Yeah, Tucker was up all night.

15:33.306 --> 15:35.440
Melody says he's teething.

15:35.442 --> 15:36.741
Well, karma's a bitch.

15:36.743 --> 15:37.808
Percy.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.176
You know, I'm really trying

15:39.178 --> 15:40.845
not to make a big deal
out of this, but...

15:40.847 --> 15:43.248
I'm really surprised
I was the last to know.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.082
Thought we were close.

15:45.084 --> 15:46.618
We are.

15:46.620 --> 15:49.720
And I wanted to tell you.
I just...

15:49.722 --> 15:51.421
I knew
you'd be disappointed.

15:51.423 --> 15:52.756
Well, look. Chris,
I'm your friend.

15:52.758 --> 15:54.224
I'm not here to judge you.

15:54.226 --> 15:56.393
Friends should judge.

15:56.395 --> 15:58.395
I'm a total zero at bein' a dad.

15:58.397 --> 16:01.431
Look, how long have you been
doing this? Like, a minute?

16:01.433 --> 16:03.433
Give yourself a chance.

16:03.435 --> 16:05.802
For the kid's sake.

16:06.604 --> 16:08.604
Thank you.

16:08.606 --> 16:10.506
Yeah.

16:10.508 --> 16:11.874
It's not gonna be easy.

16:11.876 --> 16:14.109
Petty Officer Gordon
could be anywhere.

16:16.781 --> 16:20.015
Lucky for us,
he plays trumpet.

16:29.859 --> 16:31.826
Wrap up the solo, Gordon.

16:31.828 --> 16:33.662
Time to talk.

16:33.664 --> 16:36.364
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

16:38.502 --> 16:41.034
Move! Move! NCIS!

16:43.773 --> 16:46.006
Federal agents!

16:46.008 --> 16:47.775
Stop right there!

16:48.678 --> 16:50.711
Come on, Lasalle!

17:02.724 --> 17:04.457
Nice job, slowpoke.

17:04.459 --> 17:06.858
Really need to get this
new daddy thing figured out.

17:20.678 --> 17:23.079
<i>Whatever you think</i>
<i>I did, you screwed up.</i>

17:23.080 --> 17:24.378
<i>'Cause I'm innocent.</i>

17:24.381 --> 17:26.347
P.O. Gordon,
you have psychological issues, right?

17:26.348 --> 17:29.184
Yeah, yeah. If you
ask my psychiatrist.

17:29.186 --> 17:31.156
He thinks
I suffer from paranoia.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.621
Let me guess,

17:32.622 --> 17:33.988
you think he's out to get you.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.523
That's funny.

17:35.525 --> 17:37.058
Look,
this isn't

17:37.060 --> 17:39.327
a therapy session.
This is an interrogation

17:39.329 --> 17:41.129
- and we deal in fact.
- Like the fact that you

17:41.131 --> 17:43.130
harassed Heather Cobb for taking

17:43.132 --> 17:44.698
first chair in the band.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.200
Or the fact that you broke
your band leader's arm

17:46.202 --> 17:47.868
when he decided
to transfer you.

17:47.870 --> 17:49.937
I'm an artist. They wanted
to put me on some boat.

17:49.939 --> 17:51.205
I get seasick.

17:51.207 --> 17:52.639
You joined the Navy.

17:52.641 --> 17:54.507
Finally,
we got your car

17:54.509 --> 17:57.911
on Heather's street two weeks
leading up to her murder.

17:57.913 --> 18:00.079
Her what? Whoa!

18:00.081 --> 18:01.914
This is exactly what
I'm talking about!

18:01.916 --> 18:04.250
- I'm being set up!
- So you're saying your car wasn't

18:04.252 --> 18:06.052
- at Heather's house?
- No, it was.

18:06.054 --> 18:08.654
I played in that band for
two years. I earned first chair.

18:08.656 --> 18:11.490
We can see him,
but he can't see us.

18:11.492 --> 18:13.126
I kind of need
your help here.

18:13.128 --> 18:16.995
Okay, do you...
do you recognize him?

18:16.997 --> 18:19.030
Look close,
okay?

18:19.032 --> 18:20.832
Why did you break
into her house?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.500
I didn't.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.670
I never saw his face.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.273
Okay. You didn't see him.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.375
Did you hear him?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.279
Seems like a trophy you'd want.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.447
I'm the one being
persecuted here.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.884
You guys decided I was guilty
the second you laid eyes on me.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.253
I'm the one who had
everything taken away!

18:42.255 --> 18:43.620
And you call
me paranoid.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.856
There is a word
for what you are.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.859
Is this the man
who attacked your aunt?

18:48.861 --> 18:50.794
When you really think
about it, I'm the victim

18:50.796 --> 18:52.061
in this situation.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.329
I'm definitely not a murderer.

18:53.331 --> 18:55.064
Listen, you're right...
Okay.

18:55.066 --> 18:58.367
...I was following Heather,
okay? But that's all I did.

18:58.369 --> 19:01.404
Last time I saw Heather
was a couple nights ago.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.306
She jumped the fence
at the music academy

19:03.308 --> 19:05.408
into a construction site.
Came back a few minutes later

19:05.410 --> 19:07.910
covered in dirt.
That's all I know.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.278
Anyone to confirm

19:09.280 --> 19:11.847
Heather at the music academy
that night?

19:11.849 --> 19:13.849
Yeah.

19:13.851 --> 19:15.583
There was a kid with her.

19:15.585 --> 19:18.053
In the passenger seat.

19:27.030 --> 19:30.231
Dustin says no,
he is not the killer.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.287
I say we keep that creep in
there awhile just on principle.

19:32.311 --> 19:33.836
Hey, honey,

19:33.837 --> 19:37.638
did your aunt ever take you
to the music academy at night?

19:38.908 --> 19:41.407
Did your aunt
ever take you

19:41.409 --> 19:43.076
to the academy after dark?

19:44.346 --> 19:46.112
Any idea why?

19:47.282 --> 19:49.282
No.

19:49.284 --> 19:51.051
Okay.

19:54.289 --> 19:56.056
Kid's been through a lot.

19:56.058 --> 19:57.790
Might be worth getting him
a counselor.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.092
Maybe. But he's warming up
to you, Pride.

20:00.094 --> 20:02.761
May have an idea how
to reach out to him.

20:02.763 --> 20:04.463
Well, we'll go
to the music academy.

20:04.465 --> 20:06.332
See what was so compelling
to Heather.

20:06.334 --> 20:08.133
All right, we're on it.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.910
Gregorio, wake up.

20:18.912 --> 20:20.678
Like you're
a million miles away.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.552
Not that far.

20:21.576 --> 20:23.415
I need you present
right now.

20:23.416 --> 20:25.884
Hey, I'm not sure
why you pulled me from NCIS.

20:25.886 --> 20:29.387
We've had no valid info
on Ciudad Natal in weeks.

20:29.389 --> 20:31.922
That's not exactly accurate.

20:32.791 --> 20:34.324
Walk with me.

20:34.326 --> 20:36.760
A significant amount of
cartel cash has been flooding

20:36.762 --> 20:38.428
into New Orleans
over the last few months.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.230
Tens of millions.
Maybe more.

20:40.232 --> 20:43.100
You saying New Orleans is being
used to launder drug money?

20:43.102 --> 20:45.235
Not just laundering.
The cartel's laying down roots,

20:45.237 --> 20:47.948
funding legitimate businesses.
Creating a base of operations.

20:47.949 --> 20:50.941
Any leads on who's running
this laundering operation?

20:50.942 --> 20:52.174
Maybe.

20:52.176 --> 20:55.244
Details are sketchy.

20:55.246 --> 20:57.446
You have 12 hours
to get up to speed.

20:57.448 --> 20:59.115
Leave tomorrow for D.C.

20:59.117 --> 21:02.418
We're briefing the director
and the attorney general.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.487
That's assuming you don't have
any Thanksgiving plans.

21:05.489 --> 21:07.455
Well, all I...

21:07.457 --> 21:09.090
It's a joke, Gregorio.

21:09.092 --> 21:10.258
I know you don't have plans.

21:10.260 --> 21:13.395
Actually, sir,
I do have something.

21:13.397 --> 21:18.199
You've been itching to get back
to D.C. for the last two months.

21:18.201 --> 21:20.601
Now I'm offering you face time

21:20.603 --> 21:23.404
with the two most
important people at DOJ.

21:23.406 --> 21:26.006
This is the part
where you thank me,

21:26.008 --> 21:28.475
ask what time do we leave
for the airport.

21:28.477 --> 21:31.045
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

21:37.219 --> 21:40.886
<i>Now, I know it doesn't</i>
<i>look like much,</i>

21:40.888 --> 21:42.688
but, um,
it's all mine.

21:43.758 --> 21:45.325
Best part of it is,

21:45.327 --> 21:49.395
I can play anytime I want,
as loud as I want,

21:49.397 --> 21:51.431
as long as I want.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.767
I think you might know this one.

22:05.712 --> 22:07.346
"Born Under a Bad Sign."

22:07.348 --> 22:08.613
You're good.

22:08.615 --> 22:10.115
Not as good as you are.

22:10.117 --> 22:11.616
The song's been stuck in my head

22:11.618 --> 22:13.518
since I heard you play it
at the academy.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.053
Not many kids your age
like old-time blues.

22:16.055 --> 22:18.889
Hey. Think fast.

22:18.891 --> 22:21.359
Booker T. Jones or Eric Clapton?

22:21.361 --> 22:23.494
Booker T. all the way.

22:23.496 --> 22:26.964
You know, I saw him play live
in this bar,

22:26.966 --> 22:28.732
on this very stage.

22:28.734 --> 22:30.101
For real?
For real.

22:30.103 --> 22:32.102
When I was not
much older than you.

22:32.104 --> 22:34.404
My mama was a singer.

22:34.406 --> 22:36.306
Sang with some of the best.

22:36.308 --> 22:39.242
My mama's on the ship.

22:39.244 --> 22:41.077
I miss her.

22:41.079 --> 22:44.780
I miss my mama, too.

22:44.782 --> 22:46.616
Haven't seen her in a while.

22:46.618 --> 22:48.717
But whenever
I play the piano...

22:50.721 --> 22:52.988
...I feel closer to her.

22:54.125 --> 22:55.657
We could play if you...

23:03.634 --> 23:05.233
Come on.

23:05.235 --> 23:07.135
What do you say?

23:55.916 --> 23:57.582
You okay?

23:57.584 --> 23:59.784
Yeah.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.520
Look, we need to talk
about last night.

24:06.393 --> 24:07.925
I know you're scared.

24:07.927 --> 24:09.827
My aunt told me to be brave.

24:09.829 --> 24:12.530
And you're doing great.

24:14.333 --> 24:17.667
And I know she'd
want you to help.

24:19.871 --> 24:23.707
Tell us what happened.

24:23.709 --> 24:25.675
I was hiding.

24:25.677 --> 24:27.877
I didn't really
see anything.

24:27.879 --> 24:32.014
"Didn't really see" means
maybe you saw a little bit?

24:32.016 --> 24:35.351
I should have done something.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.353
Helped her.

24:37.355 --> 24:38.954
There was nothing...

24:38.956 --> 24:42.658
nothing you could
have done then, Dustin.

24:42.660 --> 24:45.094
But now, with me,

24:45.096 --> 24:47.729
you can make a difference.

24:47.731 --> 24:50.232
I bet if you
hear a song once,

24:50.234 --> 24:54.202
you can
instantly play it.

24:54.204 --> 24:56.238
Right? Yeah.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.739
So this is
just like that.

24:57.741 --> 25:01.109
I know, I know
you can do it.

25:04.980 --> 25:07.648
He wa-- he was yelling at her.

25:07.650 --> 25:08.749
Where is it?

25:08.751 --> 25:13.187
She told him to get out.

25:13.189 --> 25:15.055
Threatened to call the cops.

25:15.057 --> 25:16.957
I'm calling the cops.

25:16.959 --> 25:20.461
That's when they started
to fight.

25:20.463 --> 25:22.862
And then he punched her.

25:27.602 --> 25:31.237
He punched her hard.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.493
<i>It's the third time I've tried</i>
<i>contacting Melody.</i>

25:54.495 --> 25:56.227
<i>No response.</i>

25:56.229 --> 25:58.229
What's up with that?
Maybe she's taking the baby

25:58.231 --> 26:00.431
for a walk or a nap.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.999
Anyway, you should be glad

26:02.001 --> 26:04.068
she's not bugging you,
family man.

26:04.070 --> 26:05.250
That's a new name for me.

26:05.274 --> 26:07.138
Mm-hmm.

26:07.139 --> 26:09.106
Kid's still
freaking you out, huh?

26:09.108 --> 26:11.475
Well, there's a learning
curve, that's for sure,

26:11.477 --> 26:13.276
but he is a lovable fella.

26:13.278 --> 26:14.678
And the girl?

26:15.780 --> 26:18.215
She's lovable, too?

26:18.217 --> 26:20.684
Melody? Sure. It's just...

26:20.686 --> 26:23.320
We had a good time
a couple years back,

26:23.322 --> 26:25.154
but I was a different guy then.

26:25.156 --> 26:27.490
She's definitely
not my idea of a wife.

26:27.492 --> 26:29.058
She doesn't have
to be your wife.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.693
You just have
to have her back.

26:30.695 --> 26:33.161
Care for the kid. Right?

26:33.163 --> 26:36.398
Melody definitely wants
more from me than that.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.901
The question is,
what do you want?

26:41.872 --> 26:44.039
I want to know what's going
on behind this fence.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.774
NCIS.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:45.776 --> 26:47.141
I'm a good guy.
Hold on. Ow!

26:48.211 --> 26:50.411
Sebastian. What are
you doing here?

26:50.413 --> 26:53.448
Hopefully not
bleeding internally.

26:53.450 --> 26:55.816
I think I landed on my keys.

26:55.818 --> 26:57.918
Thank you.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.087
I found a strange soil sample

27:00.089 --> 27:01.422
in the victim's house.

27:01.424 --> 27:03.690
Analysis came back
with evidence of PCBs.

27:03.692 --> 27:05.158
Stuff they used for insulation

27:05.160 --> 27:06.593
for electrical equipment
back in the day.

27:06.595 --> 27:08.027
Really toxic, right?

27:08.029 --> 27:09.329
Yeah. It's been
banned since the '80s.

27:09.331 --> 27:11.030
Anyway, I checked
Heather's property,

27:11.032 --> 27:13.233
no sign of the
same levels of toxicity,

27:13.235 --> 27:14.701
so I figured I'd come
to all the places

27:14.703 --> 27:17.137
she's been to recently
and gather some samples.

27:17.139 --> 27:18.438
Yeah, but you could
have called us.

27:18.440 --> 27:19.973
We would have brought you
a sample.

27:19.975 --> 27:21.006
Nah, it's good to
get out in the field.

27:21.008 --> 27:22.941
You know? Away from the lab.

27:22.943 --> 27:24.343
Breathe in the fresh air,

27:24.345 --> 27:26.044
even if it's filled
with deadly fumes.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.846
Whoa. How dangerous
is this stuff?

27:27.848 --> 27:29.348
Well, on a scale
from one to lethal?

27:29.350 --> 27:30.783
Even limited exposure can lead

27:30.785 --> 27:32.285
to serious
respiratory illnesses.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.086
It's, it's the real deal.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.959
Pride.
Got a problem, King.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.596
It looks like Heather found
sediment containing PCBs

27:44.598 --> 27:45.963
behind Dustin's school.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.532
It could be the reason
she was killed--

27:47.534 --> 27:48.966
to keep her quiet.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.669
PCBs can make someone sick?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.236
Yeah. It affects
the respiratory system,

27:52.238 --> 27:53.672
especially in kids.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.240
Okay. Good.
I-I-I got to go.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.244
Dustin... Oh, no.

28:01.246 --> 28:03.380
Oh, no. We got to get you
to the hospital.

28:03.382 --> 28:06.049
I got you, I got you.

28:17.348 --> 28:19.214
There's a doctor here.

28:19.216 --> 28:21.715
All right? Secure.

28:25.554 --> 28:27.021
Dustin's okay now.

28:27.023 --> 28:30.391
But his blood test came
back positive for PCBs.

28:30.393 --> 28:31.893
That's the same toxin
Sebastian found

28:31.895 --> 28:33.560
at the construction site
by Dustin's school.

28:33.562 --> 28:35.729
Yeah.
Hospital's contacting

28:35.731 --> 28:37.731
the other students
for testing.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.966
Probably why so
many of them got sick.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.467
Doc says that

28:41.469 --> 28:44.137
Dustin's asthma
exacerbated his reaction.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.738
Luckily, it's treatable.

28:45.740 --> 28:48.441
Music academy's been on
that location for 20 years.

28:48.443 --> 28:50.777
Nothing like this
ever happened before.

28:50.779 --> 28:53.246
Well, maybe the construction
workers uncovered the PCBs

28:53.248 --> 28:54.580
when excavating the site.

28:54.582 --> 28:56.048
Or they brought
it in with them.

28:56.050 --> 28:58.750
Either way, Heather
discovered the problem,

28:58.752 --> 29:00.719
killed before she
could expose it.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.789
It's hard enough
keeping them safe

29:03.791 --> 29:05.824
from the normal worries of life,

29:05.826 --> 29:09.328
and then you've got to wonder if
their school's on a toxic dump?

29:10.998 --> 29:13.631
That's a lot.

29:13.633 --> 29:16.901
Look...

29:16.903 --> 29:20.471
You take care of them
the best you can.

29:20.473 --> 29:23.741
Teach them how to
take care of themselves.

29:23.743 --> 29:27.312
It takes work,
sleepless nights,

29:27.314 --> 29:29.712
a lot of faith.

29:29.714 --> 29:32.916
How did you balance
it out, King?

29:32.918 --> 29:37.654
Working, marriage,
raising Laurel?

29:37.656 --> 29:41.258
You do your best.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.560
Sometimes you fail.

29:43.562 --> 29:46.895
I still worry
about Laurel every day.

29:48.466 --> 29:51.600
Gift of fatherhood.

29:57.342 --> 29:59.175
What's our next move, King?

29:59.177 --> 30:01.344
Need to figure out the origin

30:01.346 --> 30:03.044
of the toxic sediment.

30:03.046 --> 30:05.113
It could lead us
to Heather's killer.

30:06.683 --> 30:08.183
Okay.

30:09.652 --> 30:11.453
<i>Dirt pulled</i>

30:11.455 --> 30:13.821
from the construction site had
only trace amounts of PCBs.

30:13.823 --> 30:15.556
And there's not enough
there to get one kid sick,

30:15.558 --> 30:17.025
let alone half
the student body.

30:17.027 --> 30:18.293
But the construction crews

30:18.295 --> 30:20.060
were working overtime
at the school

30:20.062 --> 30:22.629
the last day or so;
I saw the bulldozer tracks.

30:22.631 --> 30:24.598
Maybe they moved
the toxic soil.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.266
Well, if they were dealing
with PCBs,

30:26.268 --> 30:27.934
then they would have had to pull
a ton of safety permits.

30:27.936 --> 30:29.436
And they definitely wouldn't
have allowed kids

30:29.438 --> 30:31.338
to be anywhere nearby
until it was all cleared.

30:31.340 --> 30:32.639
Then they moved it illegally.

30:32.641 --> 30:34.541
Okay. So Heather
figured it out,

30:34.543 --> 30:37.310
was gonna expose them,
and got killed for it.

30:37.312 --> 30:39.912
We got to get to that
construction company, now.

30:39.914 --> 30:41.208
- Hey, Sebastian...
- Yeah?

30:41.209 --> 30:42.049
Whatcha doing?

30:42.050 --> 30:43.516
I'm gonna follow
the next lead.

30:43.518 --> 30:45.618
That's kind of my thing.

30:45.620 --> 30:48.121
Your thing's staying here,

30:48.123 --> 30:50.323
analyzing evidence, crackin'
wise, that's your thing.

30:50.325 --> 30:52.825
Yeah, but I'm-I'm-I'm tired
of analyzing evidence, you know?

30:52.827 --> 30:54.393
Never seeing
a case through to the end.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.261
Well, if you're unhappy,
make a change.

30:56.263 --> 30:57.896
- You mean like quit my job?
- No.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.697
I meant, like,
taking up a hobby.

30:59.699 --> 31:01.066
Yeah. I don't
think that, uh,

31:01.068 --> 31:02.901
golf lessons are gonna fill

31:02.903 --> 31:05.404
the empty space inside me.

31:05.406 --> 31:06.938
Right now we need evidence

31:06.940 --> 31:08.507
this construction company
moved the toxic waste

31:08.509 --> 31:10.308
and Heather was trying
to expose them.

31:10.310 --> 31:12.243
I tried, though.
I mean, her-her phone

31:12.245 --> 31:13.610
and her computer were wiped,

31:13.612 --> 31:15.246
restored to
factory settings.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.114
I assume that she went to
a lab to test the soil,

31:17.116 --> 31:18.849
but there's no proof of it.

31:18.851 --> 31:20.918
You know, it's like the
killer covered all his tracks.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.554
What about the
construction company?

31:23.556 --> 31:26.290
Well, that's, uh,
Avery Builders and Dredging.

31:26.292 --> 31:28.291
They've been
around for decades.

31:28.293 --> 31:30.026
Uh, but they were
recently purchased

31:30.028 --> 31:31.394
by a guy named Javier Garcia.

31:31.396 --> 31:33.229
Okay. Who's Javier Garcia?

31:33.231 --> 31:35.932
No idea. Let's see.

31:36.967 --> 31:39.369
We're not the only ones
who are wondering.

31:39.371 --> 31:41.438
I just searched
the federal databases.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.606
FBI's looking into him, too.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.179
You look like
a woman in need

31:50.181 --> 31:51.880
of a lifeline-- cappuccino
Ah...

31:51.882 --> 31:53.782
and cannoli.
From Angelo Brocato?

31:53.784 --> 31:54.950
Mm-hmm.
You're officially

31:54.952 --> 31:56.918
my favorite person.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.120
Need a little reciprocity.

31:58.122 --> 31:59.321
Sugar for sugar?

31:59.323 --> 32:00.989
What do you need?
Everything you got

32:00.991 --> 32:02.590
on Javier Garcia.

32:03.426 --> 32:05.059
Yeah. Sorry.

32:05.061 --> 32:06.627
No can do.

32:08.030 --> 32:09.630
You're kidding me.

32:09.632 --> 32:11.065
No, I'm not.
And I don't know how

32:11.067 --> 32:13.000
you got that name,
but if Isler finds out,

32:13.002 --> 32:14.569
he's gonna think
I gave it to you.

32:14.571 --> 32:16.437
Why does Isler care
about toxic soil

32:16.439 --> 32:17.805
at a local music school?

32:17.807 --> 32:19.439
Wait a minute.
Is this connected

32:19.441 --> 32:22.309
to the Heather Cobb murder?
Yeah. We think she got hip

32:22.311 --> 32:23.910
to the PCB's in the soil

32:23.912 --> 32:25.812
making the kids sick,
started looking into

32:25.814 --> 32:27.581
the construction and dredging
company responsible.

32:27.583 --> 32:28.881
Javier Garcia owns it.

32:28.883 --> 32:30.817
Avery Builders.
We know all about it.

32:30.819 --> 32:32.185
Listen, you need to back off.

32:32.187 --> 32:34.621
Is this some kind
of state secret?

32:35.524 --> 32:37.356
It's a cartel front.

32:37.358 --> 32:40.058
Probably laundering drug money,
though we can't prove it yet.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.129
So Javier Garcia's an imbed?
He arrived in New Orleans

32:43.131 --> 32:44.930
months ago, been buying
companies and properties

32:44.932 --> 32:46.898
all over the city--
he's probably gonna be

32:46.900 --> 32:48.800
our new focus
in the investigation.

32:48.802 --> 32:50.302
Listen...

32:50.304 --> 32:52.338
you need to stay away, Percy.

32:52.340 --> 32:54.872
Dustin's in the hospital,
his aunt is dead,

32:54.874 --> 32:57.975
and the man who may be
responsible is off-limits?

32:57.977 --> 33:00.145
Come on, Gregorio,

33:00.147 --> 33:02.180
you know we're
not staying away.

33:02.182 --> 33:04.349
And you wouldn't, either.

33:08.196 --> 33:10.395
Special Agent Pride, right?

33:10.397 --> 33:12.530
That's right, Mr. Garcia.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.900
We have a warrant
to search your offices.

33:15.902 --> 33:18.803
Sounds very official.
What are you looking for?

33:18.805 --> 33:20.738
Evidence of mishandling
toxic soil

33:20.740 --> 33:22.490
at the Crescent City
Music Academy.

33:22.514 --> 33:23.775
As well as evidence

33:23.776 --> 33:25.877
about Heather Cobb's murder.
Let's go.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.879
Well, if you think I had
anything to do with that tragedy

33:28.881 --> 33:31.148
at the school,
you don't know me very well.

33:31.150 --> 33:33.383
I don't know you at all,
Mr. Garcia.

33:33.385 --> 33:34.718
But we found PCB's

33:34.720 --> 33:36.286
at your construction site.

33:36.288 --> 33:37.888
Heather Cobb did, too,
and you know

33:37.890 --> 33:39.456
what happened to her.
My son goes

33:39.458 --> 33:40.790
to that school.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.159
He's under a doctor's care

33:42.161 --> 33:43.660
for a respiratory infection,

33:43.662 --> 33:45.895
as much a victim
as the other children.

33:45.897 --> 33:46.728
This is your
construction company.

33:46.729 --> 33:49.565
I own many companies--
don't run the day-to-day.

33:49.567 --> 33:51.734
I just found out
about the PCB's.

33:51.736 --> 33:55.037
That's why I'm here--
to handle the situation.

33:59.510 --> 34:02.077
King. Take a look at this.

34:05.015 --> 34:08.183
I found this
inside that cabinet.

34:08.185 --> 34:09.583
Heather's trumpet case.

34:09.585 --> 34:11.887
Inside, a container of dirt,

34:11.889 --> 34:13.788
along with...
lab report.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.723
Taken from Heather's house.

34:18.428 --> 34:21.027
This is the man I saw you with
yesterday at the school.

34:21.030 --> 34:22.929
Theo Beattie, my foreman.

34:22.931 --> 34:24.858
I-I've been looking into
this since yesterday.

34:24.859 --> 34:28.293
Seems Theo used substandard
materials to cut costs.

34:28.295 --> 34:29.496
Contaminated soil.

34:29.521 --> 34:30.630
You know where he is?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.130
He's supposed to be here
waiting for me.

34:32.132 --> 34:33.665
I was going to deal with him.

34:33.667 --> 34:36.100
I found this e-mail
that Theo tried to delete.

34:36.101 --> 34:37.601
It's from Heather Cobb.

34:37.603 --> 34:40.405
She confronted him
about kids getting sick.

34:40.407 --> 34:42.607
Was going to the EPA.

34:42.609 --> 34:44.409
The guy's in the wind, King.

34:44.411 --> 34:46.543
Probably in Mexico by now.

34:46.545 --> 34:49.947
He'll have to go further than
that if he wants to escape me.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.851
Uh, we'll take care
of Theo Beattie.

34:55.853 --> 34:58.855
♪ Born under a bad sign ♪

35:00.959 --> 35:02.893
♪ I been down ♪

35:02.895 --> 35:04.895
♪ Since I began to crawl... ♪

35:04.897 --> 35:05.929
What's up, King?

35:05.931 --> 35:08.498
"Born Under a Bad Sign."

35:08.500 --> 35:11.434
It's the song Dustin's
been playing the whole time.

35:11.436 --> 35:13.201
Theo's ringtone?

35:13.203 --> 35:15.137
That's what he's
been trying to tell me.

35:15.139 --> 35:16.705
Just too scared to say it.

35:16.707 --> 35:18.607
Maybe he heard it
the night of the murder.

35:18.609 --> 35:21.610
Which means Dustin can put Theo
at the crime scene.

35:21.612 --> 35:23.712
We got to get to the hospital.

35:25.716 --> 35:27.515
Get inside. Now.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.620
Not a sound.

35:45.357 --> 35:46.536
What do we know?

35:46.537 --> 35:47.804
Theo Beattie snuck
into the hospital,

35:47.805 --> 35:49.204
stole scrubs and an ID,

35:49.206 --> 35:50.262
pulled a gun on the guard.

35:50.263 --> 35:51.004
Where are they now?

35:51.008 --> 35:53.374
Theo took Dustin.
There's no sign of 'em. Yet.

35:53.376 --> 35:54.810
Couldn't have gotten far.
Hospital went on lockdown

35:54.812 --> 35:57.378
minutes after Theo took the kid.
They got to be here somewhere.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.313
I thought you weren't supposed
to play with us.

35:59.315 --> 36:01.115
What can I say,
I just can't quit you.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.449
Come on, Dustin,
where are you?

36:02.451 --> 36:04.084
Look, Pride,
there are cops at every exit.

36:04.086 --> 36:05.953
We will find them.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.257
Think we just did.

36:10.259 --> 36:12.359
Let's go.
Gregorio, with me.

36:12.361 --> 36:13.894
Lasalle, Percy,
right hallway.

36:21.736 --> 36:23.870
NCIS! Stop!

36:24.539 --> 36:25.538
Theo.

36:25.540 --> 36:26.605
Let the boy go.
He's sick.

36:26.607 --> 36:27.841
Needs to be
in the hospital.

36:27.843 --> 36:30.643
You do not want to hurt
anybody else.

36:30.645 --> 36:32.510
Stay away from me.

36:32.512 --> 36:34.713
It was an accident.

36:34.715 --> 36:36.425
Haven't you done enough
to him already?

36:36.426 --> 36:38.351
I didn't know
that soil was toxic.

36:38.352 --> 36:40.418
She didn't give me a chance
to fix it.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.653
You're saying Heather Cobb's
to blame?

36:41.655 --> 36:43.121
She was gonna report me.

36:43.123 --> 36:44.489
I-I had to keep her quiet.

36:44.491 --> 36:46.225
I was as good
as dead.

36:46.227 --> 36:47.726
You don't know who I work for!

36:47.728 --> 36:49.426
Garcia doesn't
forgive mistakes.

36:49.428 --> 36:51.929
You can't help me.

36:51.931 --> 36:54.498
Yes, I can.
You are not gonna hurt that boy.

36:57.803 --> 37:00.037
You got
to let him go, Theo.

37:01.407 --> 37:02.373
He needs his inhaler.

37:03.343 --> 37:04.641
Dustin, you okay?

37:08.380 --> 37:09.479
Theo!

37:09.481 --> 37:10.747
He's sick. Let him go.

37:12.617 --> 37:15.551
He can't breathe!

37:15.553 --> 37:16.786
Let him go!

37:20.993 --> 37:22.392
Drop your weapon.

37:22.394 --> 37:24.493
Theo! Drop it!

37:24.495 --> 37:25.861
Now!

37:27.198 --> 37:28.663
Don't move!

37:28.665 --> 37:29.865
All right,
against the wall.

37:29.867 --> 37:31.767
Hands behind your back.
It's okay. All right.

37:34.038 --> 37:36.805
You did good.
You did real good, Dustin.

37:36.807 --> 37:38.774
You're safe now.

37:52.889 --> 37:54.155
Hey.

37:54.157 --> 37:56.024
Hey.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.058
Petty Officer Matthews?

37:58.060 --> 37:59.559
Special Agent Dwayne Pride.

38:00.562 --> 38:02.762
You saved my son.

38:05.067 --> 38:07.167
I don't know how to thank you.

38:07.169 --> 38:09.436
Send me his first album.

38:10.439 --> 38:12.772
I'll have him
autograph it for you.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.342
Not exactly
protocol, but...

38:16.344 --> 38:18.244
I got Heather's trumpet

38:18.246 --> 38:20.012
released from evidence.

38:21.082 --> 38:22.881
Think you should have it,
Dustin.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.551
As a reminder to keep playing
for your aunt.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.553
And you keep playing, too.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.455
For your mom.

38:29.457 --> 38:31.689
That's a deal.

38:35.162 --> 38:37.028
Hey.

38:43.136 --> 38:45.370
Take care of each other.

38:48.441 --> 38:51.075
You still here?

38:51.077 --> 38:53.110
I figured Isler
would be wondering

38:53.112 --> 38:55.312
where you are about now.
Probably.

38:55.314 --> 38:57.781
I just wanted
to see this case through.

38:57.783 --> 38:59.316
Hm.

38:59.318 --> 39:01.852
Don't be a stranger,
Gregorio.

39:18.903 --> 39:21.971
Explain something to me.

39:21.973 --> 39:25.273
I put you front and center on
the Ciudad Natal investigation.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.774
Career-making case.

39:26.776 --> 39:29.344
Yet you drop everything
to help NCIS.

39:29.346 --> 39:30.745
They were shorthanded.
Not to mention

39:30.747 --> 39:32.414
almost exposing us
to Javier Garcia.

39:32.416 --> 39:34.782
He has no idea we suspect him
of cartel ties.

39:34.784 --> 39:37.685
I thought Theo Beattie might
provide evidence against him.

39:37.687 --> 39:39.153
The construction worker?

39:39.155 --> 39:41.522
Who dumped the toxic waste
at the school? Not likely.

39:41.524 --> 39:43.424
He wasn't involved
in cartel business.

39:45.194 --> 39:47.361
I got to ask, Gregorio--

39:47.363 --> 39:49.596
are you happy at FBI?

39:51.734 --> 39:55.102
Honestly, sir...

39:55.104 --> 39:57.203
I don't know.

40:03.211 --> 40:05.178
Well, you better
figure it out quick,

40:05.180 --> 40:07.113
because we head for D.C.
in a couple of hours,

40:07.115 --> 40:09.215
and I need to know
whose team you're on.

40:16.090 --> 40:19.858
<i>I'll be honest. I'm surprised.</i>

40:19.860 --> 40:21.660
I know you haven't
been satisfied lately,

40:21.662 --> 40:23.795
but this is a big life change.

40:23.797 --> 40:26.631
You sure you're ready for it?

40:26.633 --> 40:29.368
Well, I-I don't know
if I'm ready for it,

40:29.370 --> 40:33.304
but I know I... I need
to give it a shot.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.040
I want to be part of the team.
You are part of the team.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.576
I know, I know, and lab work
is... rewarding.

40:38.578 --> 40:40.445
Or... it used to be.

40:40.447 --> 40:41.845
I just...

40:41.847 --> 40:44.648
I don't know, I-I
feel like I can...

40:44.650 --> 40:46.750
offer more.
I want to do

40:46.752 --> 40:49.119
what you guys do.
It's a hard job, Sebastian.

40:49.121 --> 40:50.954
Yeah, look,
this is not a whim, okay?

40:50.956 --> 40:52.322
I already submitted
my application

40:52.324 --> 40:53.690
to be a special
agent-- I-I...

40:53.692 --> 40:55.792
I am all in.
I was, uh,

40:55.794 --> 40:58.195
actually kind of...
hoping that...

40:58.197 --> 41:01.030
maybe I could get
a recommendation?

41:01.032 --> 41:02.732
Training is tough, Sebastian.

41:02.734 --> 41:04.633
Tougher than anything
you've ever been through before,

41:04.635 --> 41:06.235
but if you pass...

41:06.237 --> 41:08.637
I'll give you more
than a recommendation,

41:08.639 --> 41:11.307
I'll give you a job.

41:11.309 --> 41:13.275
Oh, my God, really?

41:13.277 --> 41:16.645
Yeah,
Sebastian, really.

41:16.647 --> 41:18.547
You're family,
after all.

41:41.670 --> 41:43.803
Hey, you get a chance
to talk to Pride?

41:43.805 --> 41:45.272
He's out back with Sebastian.

41:45.274 --> 41:47.073
Oh, stick around--
he'll be done soon.

41:47.075 --> 41:48.775
Actually,
I got a plane to catch.

41:48.777 --> 41:52.779
Aw, man, I thought you were
staying put for Thanksgiving.

41:52.781 --> 41:54.781
Change of plans--
heading to D.C.

41:54.783 --> 41:56.849
That's all
I was gonna tell Pride.

41:56.851 --> 41:59.218
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
