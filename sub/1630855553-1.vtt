WEBVTT

00:07.591 --> 00:11.929
Okay, everybody. Let's breathe.
Just breathe.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.224
That's right. In through the nose.
Out through the mouth.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.228
Okay, you've already done the hard part.
You didn't press that snooze button.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.106
You got out of bed to be here. Early.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.567
Okay, everybody, let's move.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.196
Up on our steps.

00:29.696 --> 00:35.536
Four, five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
And punch. Punch.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.164
Who do you wanna punch, huh?
I know who I wanna punch.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.543
And punch. Punch.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.879
Last one. Punch. And punch.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.006
Jump off our steps.

00:48.090 --> 00:54.012
Four, five, six, seven-- And stomp.
Did I say "stomp"? I meant, "Step."

00:55.305 --> 00:56.557
Step.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.641
Two more. Step.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.520
Last one. Step.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.272
Stretch it out. Swing. That's it.

01:05.065 --> 01:09.903
Stretch it out. Swing. And step.
Three, two, one.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.156
Let's switch. Three, two, one.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.659
Okay, everybody.

01:16.952 --> 01:17.995
I saw you in there.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.914
Your heels were really planted
for those step-dip lunges.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.500
You have a great base.
It's so much better for your knees.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.044
Thanks. So, Ernie wants to have a meeting.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.589
I'm trying some modifications on the Step
after the joint doctor

01:28.672 --> 01:31.383
-we spoke to mentioned that--
-He's really serious about it.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.467
And before I forget,

01:32.551 --> 01:36.054
remind me to tell you what I'm thinking
about that we need for the infomercial.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.682
-We'll have to test it out first, but…
-Oh, Lord. The T word.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.602
…it's a green-screen backdrop,
so we can put it up in the studio,

01:41.685 --> 01:43.604
and you can make it look
like you're anywhere.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.023
-So we can try different backgrounds.
-Yeah.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.609
Snowcapped mountains,
pink sand beaches in Bermuda,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.277
-a yacht. I mean--
-Sheila, stop.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.697
Just-- Sorry. Just, Ernie wants to meet.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.034
He insists, in fact,
that we convene the board.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.952
Convene?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.621
It's the official terminology.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.249
Look, I've used every excuse in the book.
He's not backing off.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.002
-This is my company.
-Our company.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.963
-Yes, of course. I was just--
-That we started together with Ernie too.

02:10.506 --> 02:12.799
And Ernie's best friend: Ernie's money.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.513
Very well. We shall convene the board.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.639
Thank you.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.850
I still don't understand
what Ernie's big problem is.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.311
With launching a product
that somebody else just launched,

02:24.394 --> 02:27.731
and that somebody is the famous star
of a television show?

02:28.732 --> 02:29.733
It's a challenge.

02:30.234 --> 02:34.321
And it's one that I am choosing to meet
with gratitude and excitement.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.703
That's when the police start in,
shooting rubber bullets,

02:41.787 --> 02:44.331
which sounds like a kid's toy.
Let me tell you right now, it's not.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.542
They hurt like shit.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.294
Comrade of ours
actually took one to the face.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.089
Son of a bitch was lodged in his cheek.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.175
So blood is everywhere,
and I'm doing what I do.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.761
I'm looking around. "How can I help?
What can I find?"

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
And all I've got is my bandana.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.267
No good. I need it.
So I don't breathe in the tear gas.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.396
So that's what I would call a tough spot
or a difficult position.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.651
-I'm from Orange County.
-I'm sorry?

03:12.734 --> 03:16.864
I had asked where you were from
before you started talking.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.409
Right. Yeah, well-- And, you know,
I'm just a little out of…

03:20.951 --> 03:25.497
practice of meeting people
since the divorce.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.750
-What? I didn't catch that.
-My divorce.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.586
-Sorry?
-Are you joking?

03:31.795 --> 03:32.921
You are. All right.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.339
Yeah, okay, you are.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.800
I like jokes. I like stuff like that.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.845
I can laugh at myself and the stigma
and the shame.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.096
Another drink helps.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.182
We're just making small talk.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.476
Yes, we are all skimming the surface here.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.522
You're right. So you are Lisa,

03:50.606 --> 03:52.566
-from Orange County.
-Right.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.734
And you're Mary. From?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.110
-Ohio.
-Ohio.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.446
Weather's a lot better out here,
I can tell you that.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.074
Yeah. Okay, so, Mary from Ohio,
we're gonna talk about the weather.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.119
And, Lisa, we're gonna have another drink.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.954
Now you're getting the hang of it.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.836
Hey, that goes straight to the ocean.
You know that, right?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.756
You should take a second and think
about which receptacle it goes in

04:15.839 --> 04:17.841
before you pitch it in the garbage.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.193
Today was a good day.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.448
Hair-wise and work-wise.

04:42.533 --> 04:46.286
You did good things, and nothing bad.

04:48.539 --> 04:52.292
You were gentle on yourself and others.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.800
Okay.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.554
One, two, three, four.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.059
Sweetie?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.854
What are you doing up?
It's past your bedtime.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.981
I'm watching Kelly Kilmartin.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.941
And pull.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.361
Reach and pull. 'Cause we don't want
to pull any muscles, do we, Johnny?

05:20.696 --> 05:21.697
Reach and pull.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.199
Just like you're climbing up
a banana tree.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.617
You really like this, don't you?

05:25.701 --> 05:27.452
You gentlemen are doing great. Okay.

05:28.495 --> 05:34.459
-Are you ready? Just bend over for me.
-You've got a bigger vine than I do.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.296
Bend over and pull.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.632
Bend and pull. Doing great.
That's right. Yeah.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.343
Pull and tug. Okay.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.513
-Yeah.
-You need to go to bed, sweetie.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.140
Pull and tug.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.351
-Are you watching?
-Yeah.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.478
I'm watching.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.107
-You and 20 million other Americans.
-And now we're gonna stay down.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.984
-Okay? Wiggle.
-Sure you're not nervous?

06:14.124 --> 06:17.628
I'm Greta. I love your top.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.505
Thank you.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.883
Loretta is going to hand you the files

06:22.966 --> 06:25.052
she's assembled for me
over the last few weeks.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.057
-Why did it take so long?
-It didn't.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.856
We ask that you
keep this process confidential.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.776
-Thank you.
-I think you'll be pleased.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.572
So this is all very James Bond,
which is super exciting.

06:45.656 --> 06:49.326
But I can't do anything
quasi-legal. Or illegal.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.579
Not without talking to my husband first.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.581
We don't engage in any illegal activity.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.085
We just call in favors
from our fellow parishioners.

06:59.211 --> 07:04.049
Discovery in the pursuit of understanding
is, by nature, virtuous.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.592
Amen.

07:07.886 --> 07:08.720
She's beautiful.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.098
Is that your baby?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.770
Is that-- Okay. Great.

07:36.832 --> 07:37.833
Jesus.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.341
Objectively speaking,
these are smoking hot nudie pics.

07:46.425 --> 07:50.554
Of a very different Kelly Kilmartin
than America knows and loves.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.891
Okay, but let's just walk this
down the road a little bit, shall we?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.100
Holy Moses.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.145
Okay, we sell these beaver shots to, what,
the National Enquirer?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.229
Yeah?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.314
They publish them,

08:00.397 --> 08:02.941
and she loses a couple of
endorsement deals.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.735
Something like that. I don't know.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.236
Where does that leave us?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.822
In the lead, which is where we wanna be.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.326
No. It leaves us with, A:

08:12.409 --> 08:15.370
a guilty conscience for bashing
another woman's healthy sexual appetite.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.705
That's one way to put it.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.541
And, B: no better off than we were before.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.626
I don't see it like that.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.629
Who's to say taking her down
means you automatically take her place?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.340
She's a TV star. You're…

08:27.799 --> 08:28.926
not.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.054
What's in the other file?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.308
-Sheils?
-What?

08:37.142 --> 08:40.770
While they were digging, I just had them
look up some stuff on Danny, you know.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.688
Just in case. It's no big deal.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.777
You said you and Danny had settled things.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.112
You didn't wanna spend any more
of your energy fighting.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.448
I don't, exactly.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.992
But it doesn't hurt to also
have an insurance policy.

08:54.076 --> 08:59.289
Right, but isn't one of the steps
in your recovery integrity?

08:59.873 --> 09:00.874
Recovery's a long road.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.710
And while I have made many strides,
I still have many more to go.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.798
And while we obviously
would have preferred

09:07.881 --> 09:10.300
Kelly Kilmartin not have the head start
that she does,

09:10.384 --> 09:12.219
I'm still choosing to see it as a positive

09:12.302 --> 09:14.429
-and something we can learn from.
-And therein lies the problem.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.556
Excuse me?

09:16.139 --> 09:19.643
You don't get to choose.
Reality is what it is.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.311
She beat you to the punch.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.397
Choosing to see that as something good is…

09:24.731 --> 09:25.732
delusional.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.402
It's allowed us to fine-tune
our understanding

09:28.485 --> 09:31.530
of what exactly the customer wants,
which, I believe, is actually

09:31.613 --> 09:34.324
-what we're trying to sell.
-The customer wants a product, okay?

09:34.408 --> 09:38.245
And you don't have any customers
because you seem…

09:38.328 --> 09:42.833
almost pathologically hell-bent
on not putting out a product.

09:43.750 --> 09:48.297
I'm not sure you're qualified
to diagnose me, Ernie.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.508
How long did it take
to develop the Step product?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.635
-It took three months.
-And in that time,

09:53.719 --> 09:56.763
we paid for how many prototypes
until you were happy?

09:57.764 --> 09:58.682
Seven.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.768
So you're opposed to innovation?
To new ideas? Just--

10:01.852 --> 10:04.688
We no longer have the time
nor the money for new ideas.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.231
We're going with what we got, okay?

10:06.315 --> 10:07.149
That's not okay.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.109
The rest of the board
is in full agreement.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.904
Decision is final.
The Step is going to market.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.364
End of meeting. Thanks, everyone.

10:14.448 --> 10:18.619
Actually, I would like to speak, Ernie,

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
on behalf of the mother of my child.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.291
-Mother Earth.
-Jesus Christ, Danny.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.542
What?

10:25.626 --> 10:30.464
This Step product, like so many plastics,
contains artificial material,

10:30.547 --> 10:35.302
that when broken down and allowed to
contaminate our oceans and rivers,

10:35.385 --> 10:39.389
cause irreparable damage
to billions of microorganisms

10:39.473 --> 10:41.642
that are the foundation
of our food pyramid.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.977
Here I have some

10:44.061 --> 10:48.982
supporting literature compiled
and published by Ocean Advocates.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.528
My new gig. Consulting. Part-time.
That's my choice.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.488
They want me there all the time.
I can't do that.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.075
I want to offer to the group

10:58.158 --> 11:01.203
the idea that we maybe have our customers…

11:01.286 --> 11:07.084
Today I am celebrating 60 days
without any intrusive critical voices

11:07.167 --> 11:09.586
-or binges to shut them out.
-That's great.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.922
Thank you.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.467
It may not seem like a lot to some of you,
but to me, it is.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.638
Especially with the pressure
that I'm under with work and with life.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.432
But working the program
is really working for me,

11:22.516 --> 11:26.186
and just knowing that I have a place
to come every week to talk, be heard,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.273
yeah, it's been life-changing.
So thank you.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.775
That's my share. See you next week.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.443
Yay.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.365
If I may,
just a quick point of order for the group.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.952
There's something we need to vote on.
According to the bylaws.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.373
There is a man
who wants to join the group.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.792
His name is Jim R.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.044
What does the "R" stand for?

11:52.629 --> 11:53.547
What?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.633
Oh, right. Anonymous.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.805
Yeah. Anyway, we've never had a man
ask to join the group,

12:01.889 --> 12:04.391
and I understand that men
have eating disorders.

12:04.975 --> 12:10.063
And I find that comforting and a little--
just a little hilarious.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.232
I personally would not feel safe
with a man here.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.028
Okay. Marsha, Carrie, what about you guys?

12:16.111 --> 12:17.112
I don't know.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.324
I'm against it too. Adamantly.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.076
Me too. Adamantly too.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.578
I have to agree.

12:25.746 --> 12:26.747
So is that that?

12:29.625 --> 12:31.084
Because the queen has ruled?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.045
You asked for opinions.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.171
And it's her house.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.340
Yeah, until those asshole alcoholics

12:36.423 --> 12:38.217
give us a time slot
down in the community room.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.845
I mean, I, for one, like the idea
of adding a little sausage to the party,

12:41.929 --> 12:45.474
so all in favor of not being pussies,
raise your hand.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.939
Just me. Shocker.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.817
All right, motion defeated.
Status quo antebellum.

12:56.401 --> 12:59.863
Olympic fever is already
spreading here in the southland,

12:59.947 --> 13:03.951
so we're on the scene with
San Diego's very own John Breem.

13:04.451 --> 13:09.039
It sure is hard not to be inspired
by the discipline and dedication

13:09.122 --> 13:11.124
of the athletes competing in the Games,

13:11.208 --> 13:16.797
particularly when we have the opportunity
to witness many of these elite athletes

13:16.880 --> 13:18.966
training right here in our own community.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.844
-What a steaming pile of shit.
-They're terrific role models…

13:21.927 --> 13:24.471
Yeah. The only opportunity
you're supporting is your own.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.724
-…from San Diego…
-Advertising on the backs of these kids.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.644
-…right here…
-See, I know him…

13:30.727 --> 13:32.646
-…in our community.
-…personally, unfortunately,

13:32.729 --> 13:38.151
and let me tell you something.
He is a lying sack of shit.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.156
Can I get another one of the-- this.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.867
-Whatever. The fuck.
-Coming right up.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.327
You're gonna do so great, sweetie.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.912
You don't have to, you know, do great.

13:48.996 --> 13:52.291
Just do yourself.
Or be yourself rather. That's all.

13:52.374 --> 13:53.834
We love you.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.421
We love you, kiddo.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.507
Now get in there and knock 'em dead.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.427
-Bye.
-Bye, sweetie.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.137
Bye.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.391
-Did you look at the material on plastics?
-Just because you're entitled

14:09.474 --> 14:11.185
-to come to meetings…
-It's important that you look…

14:11.268 --> 14:13.020
-…it doesn't mean you're required to.
-…at the stuff.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.272
I'm not just coming up with it.
I'm giving it to you for a reason.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.774
-You're making me feel self-conscious…
-You know who I saw on television?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.735
-…and you're not contributing anything…
-Twinkle toes.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.986
-John Breem.
-…to the meeting.

14:21.069 --> 14:24.031
-Mr. Mormon. Tippity-Tap. Yeah.
-Yes, I get who you're trying to insult.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.074
Everybody seems to have
so much time to watch television

14:26.158 --> 14:28.202
when all I'm doing is working,
building my business…

14:28.285 --> 14:30.120
-…and all that horseshit…
-…paying all the bills,

14:30.204 --> 14:32.080
-looking after our daughter…
-…drunk on his own cocktail…

14:32.164 --> 14:33.165
…trying to build something--

14:33.248 --> 14:35.334
Do you think that maybe
you ruined Maya's life by cheating on me?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.794
I think I would have ruined it more
by staying with you

14:37.878 --> 14:39.713
and pretending that I was still happy.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.049
We're having a Penny Social
for new families.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.384
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

14:44.468 --> 14:48.096
We're having a Chinese raffle
and Indian teepee toss.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.389
That does sound fun.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.517
I wonder if there's any other cultures
you can insult.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.602
Maybe there's a
"Pin the nose on the rabbi."

14:53.685 --> 14:55.771
I'm sorry.
I think we're going to need two.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.981
We're divorced.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.651
Sure. I'll see you there.

15:03.779 --> 15:04.905
Wow.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.115
Nice.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.494
Oh, no, no more for me.
I have a whole run of meetings tomorrow.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.830
My wife, the business lady.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.207
Businesswoman.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.291
Oh, okay.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.919
Well, what's the latest?
You got any new videos coming out?

15:19.002 --> 15:21.380
Ask Ern. He's nickel-and-diming us.

15:21.463 --> 15:23.757
I tell ya, he loves to take risks
in the bedroom,

15:23.841 --> 15:24.842
but in the boardroom,

15:24.925 --> 15:26.510
aversion's his middle name.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.267
Hey, Greta. I--

15:33.350 --> 15:35.269
Can you help me with something
in the kitchen, sweetheart?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.645
Oh, yeah. Hold on.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.981
Don't cut into that without us.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.816
Come on, I'll bake your Alaska.

15:45.279 --> 15:49.074
Don't ever embarrass me
in front of my colleagues again.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.953
Everything we have is because of me.

15:54.955 --> 15:55.956
Everything.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.141
But you know those Ortega chilies can be

16:14.224 --> 16:16.185
a lot hotter than you expect sometimes.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.979
It says "mild" on the can,
and then inside,

16:19.062 --> 16:20.606
you get a big surprise.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.066
Good evening.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.655
Sorry,
I'm a little later than usual today.

16:28.739 --> 16:33.452
We're perfectly happy here.
Your Grace is a little angel from heaven.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.078
Bless her soul.

16:35.621 --> 16:38.165
And we have a plate for you,
warm in the oven.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.876
The boys had theirs already
and went upstairs.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.505
But not before thanking us
and taking their own dishes to the sink.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.591
Somebody raised them right.

16:48.217 --> 16:52.721
And how does she seem today?

16:53.430 --> 16:55.849
Not too bad, I would say.

16:56.767 --> 17:02.898
There was one incident,
but all in all, not too bad.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.946
She asked us to go.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.659
She used strong language.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.411
I understand.

17:16.494 --> 17:20.874
We told her we were trying to help her
get through this difficult time,

17:20.958 --> 17:23.167
that our whole community was behind her.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.380
But she really, strongly wanted us to go.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.384
So we did as you asked
and made sure she was…

17:31.718 --> 17:32.719
secure.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.226
Well, I better go check on her then.

17:41.937 --> 17:42.938
Thank you both.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.116
You're here early.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.577
Just trying to brainstorm.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.704
It's easier when it's early, you know?
Quieter.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.542
Trying not to take that personally.
I'm such a motormouth.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.169
No, I'm happy you're here.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.088
I've been feeling so lonely
by myself lately, I--

18:09.339 --> 18:10.465
This doesn't make any sense,

18:10.549 --> 18:15.679
but I used to have a lot more
company in my head,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.514
and I don't miss it exactly, but--

18:17.598 --> 18:19.850
-Company in your head?
-That sounds crazy.

18:20.934 --> 18:21.935
No.

18:23.437 --> 18:28.025
I had this mean critical voice
in my head for forever,

18:28.108 --> 18:30.986
since I was a teenager at least and…

18:32.196 --> 18:34.573
you know, since recovery, it got quiet,
which is a good thing,

18:35.115 --> 18:37.326
but sometimes I wonder, you know,
if that's what drove me

18:37.409 --> 18:39.036
and that's what got me here,
and without it,

18:39.119 --> 18:40.954
I might not be able to, you know, keep--

18:43.123 --> 18:45.501
Oh, my good-- Are you okay? I'm so--
Did I upset you?

18:45.584 --> 18:48.045
-No, it's not you. Just--
-What? Sit.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.214
It's-- Me and Ernie, we're kinda--

18:51.715 --> 18:55.093
It's hard. He was just so mean to me
last night, like…

18:55.177 --> 18:56.637
he made me feel like nothing,

18:56.720 --> 18:59.056
and he did it in front of
Bonnie and Pete Nickerson.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.724
I'm--

19:01.433 --> 19:03.101
I don't even know what I'm doing.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.646
We put all that money into the Step,

19:05.729 --> 19:07.648
and then we just get it scooped out
from under us.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.650
Who do I think I am?

19:09.733 --> 19:12.694
I can't even use the remote control
without Ernie showing me first.

19:12.778 --> 19:15.197
I hate hearing you talk like this.
This is not you.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.366
I can't ask Ernie for any more money.

19:18.075 --> 19:20.577
I believe in you, Sheils, I really do.

19:20.661 --> 19:22.913
But if I lose my Ern, I--

19:22.996 --> 19:26.041
Everything I have is 'cause of him.
I mean, he said so.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.794
Let me get you a glass of water.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.430
Hey! Excuse me.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.766
What's the "D" stand for?

19:43.725 --> 19:44.560
What?

19:44.643 --> 19:47.771
I don't remember there
being a D there before. That new?

19:47.855 --> 19:53.402
Yes. Well, no, it's my middle name,
Dale. From my mother's family.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.531
I thought maybe it stood for "divorced."

20:00.033 --> 20:03.537
What is that outfit?
Are you going for a swim?

20:04.788 --> 20:07.457
It's not an outfit. It's a costume.

20:08.542 --> 20:12.212
You know, I'm a Southern belle
who got caught shoplifting

20:12.296 --> 20:15.549
and sentenced to be a lifeguard
at a public pool.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.594
"Don't make me blow my whistle on you."

20:21.054 --> 20:22.681
Haven't you seen Trish Out of Water?

20:24.766 --> 20:25.851
I suppose I have.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.061
Well, I didn't write the thing.
I just starred in it.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.064
Now, you better hurry up and tell me
why you summoned me here,

20:31.148 --> 20:35.736
'cause I got a full day of fittings
and meetings, meetings about fittings.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.906
It's just, people don't know
how time-consuming it is

20:38.989 --> 20:40.157
to get this look together.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.035
So much time for so little clothing.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.122
How you like that line?
I'm workshopping it.

20:48.081 --> 20:48.916
For what?

20:49.541 --> 20:50.667
Late-night television.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.795
I just did Johnny's show
for the first time and not the last.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.047
Yes, I saw it.

20:55.130 --> 20:57.841
Too bad he wouldn't like you,
as pretty as you are.

20:57.925 --> 21:00.260
He just has a thing for blondes.

21:00.344 --> 21:05.307
Sweet, young, all-American blondes.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.769
You're not that sweet, or young.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.732
Somebody put a little pepper
in your ketchup today. Didn't they?

21:14.316 --> 21:15.317
Speaking of ketchup,

21:17.194 --> 21:19.696
what do you think Johnny would do

21:19.780 --> 21:22.908
if somebody sent him
those nudie pics of yours?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.202
How do you know about those?

21:26.787 --> 21:27.955
I have my methods.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.209
He'd say, "Praise Jesus,
and pass the hand lotion."

21:33.460 --> 21:35.212
You can't get rid of me that easily.

21:36.713 --> 21:39.341
I've done it before. You're not even real.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.387
I'm better than real.

21:43.887 --> 21:47.599
I'm on television, and if you're gonna get
where you wanna go,

21:47.683 --> 21:50.894
you'd better get that cute little
behind of yours on television too.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.231
Do you really think it's little?

21:55.649 --> 21:56.650
Bless your heart.

21:58.944 --> 22:01.613
Greta thinks that we can't
spend any more of Ernie's money.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.741
Only ugly people have to pay
to get on television.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.077
Beautiful people have other means.

22:15.627 --> 22:19.464
I'm sorry. I'll get that water.

22:28.223 --> 22:32.436
Qualifying times for the 400 meter hurdles
are now officially posted.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.777
-Can I help you with something, ma'am?
-No, I'm fine. Thank you.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.863
-This is a restricted area, ma'am.
-I'm with him.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.365
It's okay.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.996
Olympic glory, huh?

22:51.580 --> 22:53.874
It's just a satellite facility.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.543
But it's good to be of service.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.088
And promote your business in the process?

23:01.256 --> 23:02.257
Thanks for stopping by.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.052
How did you get on television?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.471
-Do you know TV people?
-Hey, Dad, did you--

23:08.972 --> 23:10.057
Hey, aren't you--

23:10.140 --> 23:12.559
-No. Son, you don't know her.
-Wha--

23:12.643 --> 23:15.479
From Mom's tapes, right?
Yeah, she watches them all the time.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.982
Or she did before. She's not allowed to
exercise since the baby.

23:20.859 --> 23:24.238
Oh, well, tell her that
my new Step workout is actually safe

23:24.321 --> 23:26.823
for women six-weeks postpartum
for vaginal birth

23:26.907 --> 23:28.867
and three months after cesarean.

23:28.951 --> 23:30.160
How old is the baby?

23:31.703 --> 23:32.704
What?

23:36.041 --> 23:39.586
Well, I don't know about that.
But the ladies at church, they said that,

23:39.670 --> 23:42.464
she just needs to rest until God's able
to shed the light back into the darkness

23:42.548 --> 23:44.633
she's been feeling since the baby
was brought into this world.

23:44.716 --> 23:47.678
Zeke, why don't you
get back to the gang over there?

23:47.761 --> 23:49.805
-Okay. All right. Bye.
-I'll meet you in a second.

23:53.684 --> 23:56.895
She's been having trouble since the baby?

23:58.814 --> 24:00.941
Our transaction was
supposed to put an end to this.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.569
That was our agreement.

24:03.652 --> 24:04.778
Well, it didn't work.

24:05.612 --> 24:07.781
Because I don't wanna be
that kind of person anymore.

24:08.699 --> 24:10.826
Who has to sneak through the back door.

24:10.909 --> 24:11.910
I…

24:13.912 --> 24:17.249
I wanna earn things like an athlete.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.210
By asking me to pull strings for you?

24:21.420 --> 24:22.880
You know, if your wife has baby blues,

24:22.963 --> 24:25.215
exercise could be exactly what she needs.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.385
You don't need to concern yourself
with her well-being.

24:29.094 --> 24:31.180
I concern myself
because that's my calling.

24:32.181 --> 24:33.974
I didn't find exercise, it found me.

24:35.475 --> 24:40.564
It saved me. And teaching it,
it's what I'm here for.

24:44.151 --> 24:47.613
I just need your contact
and I'll do the rest myself.

24:52.534 --> 24:55.579
There is someone I know at KUAY.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.332
I can't guarantee anything.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.348
I know this sounds crazy coming from me,

25:14.431 --> 25:17.601
but these Steps are a waste of money,
all of them.

25:17.684 --> 25:22.523
Mine, Kelly Kilmartin's, and they're all
made from artificial plastic materials

25:22.606 --> 25:25.108
that end up littering
our beautiful oceans.

25:25.192 --> 25:29.530
The truth is, you don't need any
special devices to get in a good workout.

25:30.030 --> 25:33.367
All you need is music, energy and--
You know what?

25:33.867 --> 25:36.245
Why don't I stop telling you
and just show you what I mean.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.121
Come on.

25:42.459 --> 25:46.046
Four, five, six, five, six, seven, eight.

25:46.964 --> 25:50.634
Knee, knee, that's it. Let's move.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.219
You too, guys. Get in here.

25:55.973 --> 25:57.724
You got this. Keep it going now.

25:57.808 --> 26:01.270
You don't need to Step, step it up.
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

26:02.312 --> 26:04.982
Take it to the next level.
Doesn't that feel good?

26:09.319 --> 26:10.821
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.032
Single, single, double,
single, single, double.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.454
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

26:19.538 --> 26:22.791
We're taking it up.
That's it, all the way to the top.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.121
I can't believe you just walked in there

27:01.205 --> 27:02.623
and got on television.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.291
-Got a job on television.
-Well, I--

27:04.374 --> 27:07.544
-National television.
-I don't know if it's national every week,

27:07.628 --> 27:09.963
but, yes, they want me back.

27:10.047 --> 27:12.090
Once a week, my own segment.

27:12.174 --> 27:13.800
This is big, and so is the salary.

27:13.884 --> 27:15.552
We can tell Ernie to go fuck himself.

27:15.636 --> 27:19.431
I love my husband, but good boundaries
make good marriages.

27:19.515 --> 27:20.682
-Good boundaries.
-Good boundaries.

27:20.766 --> 27:22.100
Oh, my goodness.

27:28.607 --> 27:31.401
Okay, you did it. Just like I told you to.

27:32.319 --> 27:35.280
Now, wait till they see
just how fucking crazy you really are.
