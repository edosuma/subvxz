WEBVTT

00:09.260 --> 00:12.700
What I do is not so different
from a conventional career, is it?

00:14.260 --> 00:16.540
The same basic rules apply.

00:18.940 --> 00:21.145
If you want to stay on top,

00:21.180 --> 00:23.060
you need to be in control at all times.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.625
One thing this job has taught me,

00:42.660 --> 00:45.460
is that you can't lie back and
expect things to just happen.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.425
If you want to diversify,

00:49.460 --> 00:51.505
you've got to grab your opportunities,

00:51.540 --> 00:54.700
seize your moments, don't
let them pass you by.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.300
Timing is everything.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.825
And you have to be versatile.

01:01.860 --> 01:04.420
Transferable skills are a must.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.420
And you thought you
knew everything about me.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.260
You're welcome.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.620
Great disguise.

02:04.260 --> 02:06.540
Enjoy. It's a triumph already.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.225
Am I allowed to talk to you?

02:22.260 --> 02:24.340
Yeah, but can you not pull that face?

02:24.375 --> 02:26.420
You look like you're having a stroke.

02:26.455 --> 02:28.865
I'm trying to be discreet.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.700
- Why are you wearing a
bow-tie? - What's wrong with it?

02:31.735 --> 02:34.025
Nothing, it's just... not very you.

02:34.060 --> 02:37.860
You've got to look the part.
It was either this or a cravat.

02:37.895 --> 02:39.620
Mmm.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.945
Thank you.

02:42.980 --> 02:45.065
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.500
Welcome to the launch of atwood
and Kalberg's latest title.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.225
"The Secret Life of a London Call Girl"

02:55.260 --> 03:00.580
makes no apologies for lifting the
lid on the sex life of our capital.

03:00.615 --> 03:03.225
It's not for the faint-hearted,

03:03.260 --> 03:06.745
but it does make for
a scintillating read

03:06.780 --> 03:10.860
and we are extremely proud
to be launching it tonight.

03:10.895 --> 03:12.740
Woo!

03:14.220 --> 03:16.780
The author passes on her apologies.

03:16.815 --> 03:18.585
She can't be with us tonight.

03:18.620 --> 03:22.140
If you read the book, you'll
understand she has a busy schedule.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.305
But we do have the pleasure
of hearing an extract.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.380
Guests with pacemakers may want
to retire to the drawing room.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.345
- I don't believe that.
- I know.

03:38.380 --> 03:41.140
They can't be real.
Look at the size of them!

03:41.175 --> 03:43.025
That's supposed to be me.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.460
Talk about perpetuating a
myth. This is ridiculous.

03:45.495 --> 03:47.105
What?

03:47.140 --> 03:48.985
It's good.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.940
The first thing you should know...

03:50.975 --> 03:52.505
Sorry.

03:52.540 --> 03:55.300
Is that I am a whore.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.900
Oh, Jesus.

03:58.660 --> 04:00.665
Best take two.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.540
I'm very high class, which
means I charge by the hour...

04:04.575 --> 04:06.877
And I charge a lot.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.145
No money, no honey.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.625
Never play until they pay.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.820
Oh, come on, I've gotta
be in here somewhere.

04:13.855 --> 04:16.065
Fortunately, however...

04:16.100 --> 04:19.500
it's only my manager
who ever robs me blind.

04:19.535 --> 04:22.657
No longer able to shake
her own money-maker.

04:22.692 --> 04:25.780
The terrible old tart
takes 40% of our fees.

04:27.740 --> 04:32.060
So if you want to know what
really goes on behind closed doors,

04:32.095 --> 04:33.940
come with me.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.780
I'll tell you everything I know.

04:37.815 --> 04:39.220
Woo!

04:44.100 --> 04:46.065
Sounded good, didn't it?

04:46.100 --> 04:48.300
Hey! Where are you
going? It wasn't that bad.

04:48.335 --> 04:49.900
To throw myself off the fire escape!

04:56.220 --> 04:58.905
Apparently, she doesn't even exist.

04:58.940 --> 05:01.660
It's all just part of a
clever marketing campaign.

05:01.695 --> 05:03.980
It's awful, isn't it?
It's so misogynistic.

05:04.015 --> 05:05.580
I'll bet it's written by a man.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.105
Ah! I used to be a waitress.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.340
Don't worry, it won't be forever.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.700
One of my favourite clients.

05:21.735 --> 05:23.260
A real gentleman.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.465
Hello.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
I was wondering if I
could introduce myself?

05:32.535 --> 05:35.300
Ben. Hi.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.860
What's the point in staying there,

05:41.895 --> 05:44.180
when there's some real fun to be had?

05:46.500 --> 05:47.980
Can I...?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.905
So what brings you here, anyway?

05:52.940 --> 05:55.265
You don't work at the company, do you?

05:55.300 --> 05:58.660
I'm in PR there. I'm sure
I would have remembered you.

05:58.695 --> 06:00.945
My friend wrote the book.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.220
Actually, I'm here on her behalf,

06:03.255 --> 06:04.780
because she's not here.

06:06.780 --> 06:09.320
She's definitely not here.

06:09.355 --> 06:11.860
- Your friend?
- Yes. Yep.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.500
Tell me more about this erm... friend.

06:17.535 --> 06:19.740
Are you very close?

06:20.980 --> 06:22.860
Yeah I guess we are.

06:25.860 --> 06:27.500
But not like that.

06:27.535 --> 06:29.180
Just mates.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.560
- Tell the truth.
- Sorry?

06:32.595 --> 06:34.660
It's you, isn't it?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.540
Hmm?

06:37.820 --> 06:40.900
You are the London call girl.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.240
I have read every word you've written

07:20.275 --> 07:23.340
and i cannot tell you
how it turns me on.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.460
Just talk like you write.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.780
Ok, but I've got to warn you...
I do a lot of re-drafting.

07:31.815 --> 07:33.620
Don't be modest.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.660
I'm going to take off all your clothes.

07:53.695 --> 07:55.465
Yes.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.545
Then I'm going to er...

07:57.580 --> 07:59.300
What? What are you going to do?

08:00.660 --> 08:02.380
Gonna throw you on the bed.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.260
Go on, then.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.825
Wah!

08:32.860 --> 08:35.900
You sexy bitch, you really turn me on.

08:35.934 --> 08:37.419
Are you ok?

08:52.380 --> 08:54.100
Oh, God.

09:01.780 --> 09:04.220
Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.820
Oh, God.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.500
Fucking hell!

09:15.220 --> 09:17.100
Do you want to take a
breather for a minute?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.745
Yeah.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.020
Maybe for just like five
minutes, or something.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.185
You know that section in the book

09:34.220 --> 09:38.580
where Belle gets whisked off
to Paris by a celebrity client?

09:40.340 --> 09:43.540
Was that based on a true story,
or did you just make that up?

09:45.900 --> 09:47.420
That was true.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.420
That wasn't in the book, Ben.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.900
- Get dressed then, shall I?
- If you wouldn't mind.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.500
Yeah.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.060
So are you going to keep
me in suspense all night?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.860
Hmm?

10:24.780 --> 10:27.145
You've forgotten,
haven't you? I knew it.

10:27.180 --> 10:30.460
Sorry, erm... you're going
to have to help me out here.

10:30.495 --> 10:32.425
Is it your birthday?

10:32.460 --> 10:35.180
No. Oh, my God. You've
really forgotten, haven't you?

10:38.940 --> 10:41.380
- What do you take me for?
- Yeah.

10:42.820 --> 10:44.425
Aaah!

10:44.460 --> 10:46.305
Now, I saved the receipt

10:46.340 --> 10:49.380
so, look, if it doesn't fit,
or the colour isn't right,

10:49.415 --> 10:50.980
- you have to let me know.
- Yes.

10:51.015 --> 10:52.500
- Can I open it?
- Ok.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.465
- It's perfect.
- Yeah? Try it on.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.580
Ok, but you can't look. I want you
to have the full effect. Turn round.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.300
Ready. Ta-dah!

11:10.140 --> 11:11.905
- You look beautiful.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

11:11.940 --> 11:15.020
I think this even beats
the King Kong snow-globe.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.460
Yes!

11:23.740 --> 11:25.580
Are you ok?

11:25.615 --> 11:27.420
Not really, no.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.065
So what is it?

11:31.100 --> 11:35.980
I don't know. I'm just having
a bit of a crisis of confidence.

11:36.015 --> 11:38.705
Seriously? Are you for real?

11:38.740 --> 11:41.380
- I mean, that was the best sex I've had in...
- No, not with this.

11:41.415 --> 11:42.940
Jesse...

11:44.180 --> 11:47.780
Do you ever feel like you've
bitten off more than you can chew?

11:47.815 --> 11:49.677
- All the time.
- Yeah?

11:49.712 --> 11:51.505
What you do about it?

11:51.540 --> 11:54.740
Well, I either spit
it out or... swallow.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.300
That's good advice.

11:59.335 --> 12:00.780
You asked.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.260
Keep it on. Ok.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.960
Breezing through reception areas
looking inconspicuous is my forte.

12:10.995 --> 12:12.680
Well, usually.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.005
At my publisher's office,

12:16.040 --> 12:19.560
I feel I might as well be wearing
a flashing sign that reads 'hooker'.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.000
None of these people know the truth.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.960
As far as they're concerned,
I'm just another author.

12:29.995 --> 12:32.365
An author!

12:32.400 --> 12:34.640
Maybe I can fake it till I make it.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.480
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

12:39.515 --> 12:41.437
Come in.

12:41.472 --> 12:43.360
Have a seat.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.400
So how did you find it, last night?

12:52.435 --> 12:54.325
I noticed you left early.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.320
Yeah, going incognito was not
quite as much fun as I'd hoped.

12:58.355 --> 13:02.685
- A bit surreal?
- Surreal, yes, that definitely.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.920
Erm... excruciatingly
painful also Springs to mind.

13:05.955 --> 13:08.205
I don't know... I
think being in disguise

13:08.240 --> 13:11.180
is a great way to hear
what the critics think.

13:11.215 --> 13:14.727
Well, people will always
want to have an opinion.

13:14.762 --> 13:18.240
But, if it's any consolation,
have a look at that.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.280
It's your first review.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.565
They're right.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.680
It's intelligent, witty, wry.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.405
So... book two?

13:32.440 --> 13:35.680
We need to really jump on the
success of this first book.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.680
How does three months
sound for a first draft?

13:38.715 --> 13:40.565
No rest for the wicked.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.085
Look, I know it doesn't sound that long

13:43.120 --> 13:46.600
but, by the time we've factored in
editing, type-setting, proofing...

13:46.635 --> 13:48.325
yeah. No, it wasn't that.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.960
It was erm... I don't know,
I'm just feeling a bit...

13:50.995 --> 13:53.480
- Daunted?
- Daunted, yeah.

13:53.515 --> 13:55.365
Understandably.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.840
I want you to go even
further with your second book.

13:57.875 --> 13:59.605
Oh, God.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.200
You're more than capable, Belle.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.780
When you say 'even further'...?

14:05.815 --> 14:09.205
I think this next book could be

14:09.240 --> 14:14.400
a real psychological exploration of you,

14:14.435 --> 14:16.085
your clients.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.400
I want you to plunder your soul.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.080
I'm not entirely sure
I'm ready to plunder.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.420
I want you to put your trust
in me completely, Belle.

14:26.455 --> 14:29.320
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I won't let you down.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.840
Why did i just agree to that?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.165
If I'm going to write a second book,

14:45.200 --> 14:47.800
I'm going to have to
do some serious whoring.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.000
- Oh, darling.
- Hiya.

14:56.035 --> 14:57.685
Bright little number.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.600
Yeah, do you think it's a bit much?

15:01.320 --> 15:02.880
- Got something for me?
- Yes.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.445
Wonderful.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.400
It's good, that book, isn't
it? I've read it three times.

15:11.435 --> 15:13.005
Have you?

15:13.040 --> 15:15.120
Yeah. I think it's really lifelike.

15:15.155 --> 15:18.357
All the girls are talking about it.

15:18.392 --> 15:21.560
Seems a little... distasteful to me.

15:21.595 --> 15:23.480
And the madam... good God!

15:23.515 --> 15:25.285
A pantomime villain.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.120
- Who on earth behaves like that?
- I don't know, she seems all right.

15:29.155 --> 15:30.960
I wonder who she is?

15:33.840 --> 15:37.280
Are we done, or is there anything
else you want to talk to me about?

15:37.315 --> 15:39.200
- No, no, nothing.
- Excellent. Ciao.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.400
Darling?

15:43.880 --> 15:45.560
Three times?

15:45.595 --> 15:46.805
Sorry?

15:46.840 --> 15:48.720
It only came out on
the shelves yesterday.

15:48.755 --> 15:50.680
You're quick, aren't you?

15:50.715 --> 15:52.485
Ciao, darling.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.240
Give my love to Belle.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.760
Onwards and upwards.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.960
An overnighter... in Mayfair.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.600
Book two, here I come.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.005
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.880
I'm going to have a mint tea
first, while I get changed.

16:24.915 --> 16:26.680
- Can I get you one?
- No thanks.

16:26.715 --> 16:28.200
Not while I'm working.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.400
Probably takes a bit of
time to get warmed up.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.245
So, chapter one:

16:40.280 --> 16:42.925
Mr. Mayfair, it turns out,

16:42.960 --> 16:46.920
has an insatiable appetite for
grinding away for hours on end.

16:46.955 --> 16:49.280
We might as well be
whittling a chair leg.

16:49.315 --> 16:51.357
Is everything ok?

16:51.392 --> 16:53.400
Everything's great.

16:53.435 --> 16:55.325
You're great.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.600
I just thought there might be something
we can do to make things a bit more...

16:59.960 --> 17:02.320
special for you.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.045
This is fine.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.500
How about a bit of erm... tie and tease?
- I have claustrophobia.

17:07.535 --> 17:10.920
- Isn't that confined spaces?
- Well, that's a big part of it yes,

17:10.954 --> 17:12.845
but i have quite an extreme type,

17:12.880 --> 17:16.520
which also includes a fear of being
bound or constricted in any way.

17:16.555 --> 17:17.800
Right.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.480
- Shall I carry on?
- Please do.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.400
I also have a fear of heights.

17:29.435 --> 17:31.125
Do you?

17:31.160 --> 17:33.360
I imagine they're probably
connected in some way.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.460
Heights and confinement.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.320
Fascinating thing, isn't it?

17:40.355 --> 17:42.485
- The human mind.
- Riveting.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.205
The thing about phobias
people don't realise

17:45.240 --> 17:50.520
is that they're all rooted to
some form of neuroses in childhood.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.400
I read this fascinating
article the other week...

17:56.400 --> 17:58.280
I know what you're going to say.

17:58.315 --> 18:00.005
Do you?

18:00.040 --> 18:02.645
Not every client I have
makes for good material.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.600
But you know what? I did the
best I could with the little I had

18:05.635 --> 18:08.017
which, by the way, was
hours staring at a ceiling,

18:08.052 --> 18:10.400
- listening to a list of phobias...
- It's brilliant.

18:10.435 --> 18:11.560
Really?

18:14.080 --> 18:18.200
- Really?
- It's very funny. It's intelligent, insightful.

18:18.235 --> 18:20.165
You're a natural raconteur.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.960
I think this is going to be
even better than your first book

18:22.995 --> 18:26.560
which, i might add, is
really saying something.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.320
- What's this?
- Print run figures.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.800
Don't get your hopes up about
being a millionaire just yet,

18:43.835 --> 18:46.360
but I think you'll
agree... pretty impressive.

18:46.395 --> 18:47.937
Fuck me!

18:47.972 --> 18:49.480
Exactly.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.240
Woo!

19:00.360 --> 19:02.325
Looks great.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.120
It must feel amazing.

19:04.155 --> 19:05.880
Yeah, it's not bad.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.520
You've not even told me what
you think of the book yet.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.445
You haven't read it, have you?

19:12.480 --> 19:14.480
- Yeah, sort of.
- I've read it three times.

19:14.515 --> 19:17.085
How can you 'sort of' read it, Ben?

19:17.120 --> 19:19.520
I've read the whatsit, on
the back, you know, the...

19:20.640 --> 19:22.200
I'll start properly tonight.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.485
What? I've been busy.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.485
- No, you haven't.
- I've read it three times.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.440
Yeah, thanks Bambi. There you
go. There's loyalty for you.

19:30.475 --> 19:32.600
You should read it, you're in it loads.

19:32.635 --> 19:34.525
- Am I?
- Yeah.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.240
I called you Jeremy.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.600
Jeremy? What the fuck
are you saying with that?

19:40.635 --> 19:42.840
- What did you think of Letitia, then?
- What?

19:42.875 --> 19:44.845
I thought I'd call you Letitia.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.040
I thought it would suit you, then
I worried it might be a bit tacky.

19:48.075 --> 19:50.445
- I'm Letitia?
- Yeah, course you are.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.280
- Could you not tell?
- Oh, my days. Letitia is amazing.

19:55.315 --> 19:57.005
- Yeah.
- She's a scream.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.120
I'm Letitia? That's
me? Oh, my bloody days.

19:59.155 --> 20:01.200
All right. Steady on. Jesus! I'm sorry.

20:01.235 --> 20:02.840
I am starring in a book.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.640
I can't believe it.

20:04.675 --> 20:06.320
I'm a star.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.885
If they do make it into a film,

20:11.920 --> 20:14.085
I'm not being called
fucking Jeremy, though.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.920
Ok, well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it, should we?

20:16.955 --> 20:19.597
I think it'll make an awesome film.

20:19.632 --> 20:22.240
I'm talking to Belle about the film.

20:22.275 --> 20:23.880
All right. Steady on, Bambi.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.285
Jackie?

20:30.320 --> 20:32.200
Why don't you answer your bloody phone?

20:32.235 --> 20:33.937
I've been calling you for ages.

20:33.972 --> 20:35.640
- Who is it?
- It's my sister.

20:35.675 --> 20:37.485
What's the matter?

20:37.520 --> 20:40.760
Patrick's having an affair. I
need to stay here for a while.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.360
Prostitute. Author. Sister.

20:47.395 --> 20:48.880
Shit.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.805
Jackie!

20:54.840 --> 20:58.060
I'm Byron. How the fuck are you?

20:58.095 --> 21:01.245
- Is Han in?
- She's out, but I'm in.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.800
I know it was you who wrote
that filthy little book.

21:03.835 --> 21:05.560
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.280
We need to talk.
