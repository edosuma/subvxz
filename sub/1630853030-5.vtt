WEBVTT

01:08.360 --> 01:11.029
I thought we was going night fishing
for some catfish, Coydog.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.489
We is, boy.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.700
I gotta say hi to my girlfriend first.

01:14.783 --> 01:18.120
Which one? Miss Charlotte or Miss Ruby?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.080
Miss Mary.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.792
Well, why we got to say hi to her
before we go fishing?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.629
Well, I promised I would help her
pay her rent.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.714
Come on, boy.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.437
Hey, hey!

02:19.598 --> 02:22.017
You know what the preacher say about sin?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.143
Yeah.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.479
Well, this is it!

02:28.357 --> 02:29.650
Hey, Coydog!

02:29.733 --> 02:31.318
Hey!

02:31.401 --> 02:35.030
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.200
I've been doing some logging
up in Van Cleve

02:38.283 --> 02:40.911
while my still leaks its bourbon.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.834
Isn't he a little young
to be in here at night, Mr. McCann?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.920
No, I'm seven years old. Big boy.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.171
Is that so?

02:51.255 --> 02:52.881
I took him for a couple of days

02:52.965 --> 02:56.218
'cause his mama had to go to New Orleans
to look after her father.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.053
And who you here to see?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.972
Miss Mary, to help her pay her rent.

03:02.558 --> 03:03.725
Miss Mary!

03:06.770 --> 03:07.771
Yes, Miss Delia.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.608
Mr. McCann here
to "help you pay your rent."

03:14.152 --> 03:15.153
I'm coming.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.992
You wanna go take a bath, big boy?

03:20.576 --> 03:22.452
-Yes, ma'am.
-Come with me.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.247
-You mind Miss Delia now, boy.
-All right.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.670
Yeah.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.463
Good time tonight!

03:42.639 --> 03:44.725
-Matrice.
-Yes, Miss D.

03:44.808 --> 03:48.020
Could you please bring a couple of buckets
of hot water for the tub?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.272
But nobody taking a bath until late.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.399
It's for our royal highness.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.613
Come on. Let's get you ready.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.178
Is the water hot enough for you, big boy?

04:23.514 --> 04:25.933
How come you got your bathtub
out in the big room?

04:26.016 --> 04:30.062
Well, it used to be upstairs,
but then Miss Loretta moved in,

04:30.145 --> 04:32.105
and there wasn't room up there no more.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.608
Anyways, down here is closer
to the hot water.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.444
Okay.

04:37.528 --> 04:40.030
You are just the sweetest child.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.448
I wanna take you home with me.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.492
Okay.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.084
Every time. Motherfucker. Every time.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.919
Come on, now. Somebody gotta lose.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.420
Goddamn cheaters!

04:56.255 --> 04:57.464
Come here, motherfucker!

04:59.758 --> 05:02.678
Stop that! Break those men up!
There ain't no fightin' in here!

05:04.137 --> 05:07.349
You're mine, son of a bitch!
You gonna cheat again?

05:09.476 --> 05:12.563
-Don't you hurt him! That's my man!
-I'll fucking kill you!

05:19.194 --> 05:20.195
Come here, baby.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.270
Hey, Pitypapa.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.649
You in there?

06:39.858 --> 06:40.859
Come on in.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.041
You fixing to shoot me?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.877
No, no, no, I--

06:58.961 --> 07:00.879
I took this here out for myself.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.803
Look at you.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.599
So, you been out with your new friend?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.229
Yes.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.108
Then why not shoot myself, huh?

07:22.484 --> 07:27.573
I mean, you all I ever had,
and now that's over.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.867
So, you set on dying?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.579
I can't think of nothing else to do.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.497
Why you got to do anything?

07:36.623 --> 07:41.378
Because you the onliest woman
I ever loved.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.507
And I came home, didn't I?

07:46.884 --> 07:48.844
You can't lose me.

07:49.678 --> 07:53.557
You gonna always be my only man.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.731
But if you wanna die,
then let me shoot you myself.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.860
'Cause right after that,
I'll put the bullet in my own heart.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.196
No. No.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.552
Uncle, wh-- Why--

08:30.636 --> 08:33.597
What-- What you--
What you doing up so late?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.015
Unwin Lomax.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.100
Who?

08:37.808 --> 08:42.773
Unwin Lomax beat down Arthur Meany,

08:42.856 --> 08:46.193
and Miss Molly stabbed him and killed him.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.278
A nightmare?

08:48.946 --> 08:50.322
Didn't start out that way.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.408
I was in the tub.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.704
Miss Matrice was heating up the bathwater.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.998
The hot water was taking off the chill.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.296
And everybody was
laughing and smiling and…

09:08.632 --> 09:11.969
I don't think I ever felt safer.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.099
But, as usual, it ain't last.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.143
I'm sorry I'm so late.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.771
But when I called you earlier,
you said everything was okay.

09:22.855 --> 09:23.856
It is.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.192
This whiskey here
just to help me get back to sleep.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.736
You could've stayed over at Roger's
if you wanted to.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.322
No, I should've been here.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.407
And I'm sorry.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.534
No need for sorrow.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.620
Nothing wrong with being young
and in love.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.581
In love?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.749
I see how that boy look at you.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.002
Me and Roger barely know each other.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.422
4:30 in the morning say different.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.592
No, we was just--

09:51.675 --> 09:53.177
Whatever. We was hanging.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.928
He good to you?

09:56.013 --> 09:57.014
Yes.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.766
Well, you willing, he able.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.186
I am pleading the fifth on that one.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.439
Well, one of these days,
you'll look back on this,

10:05.522 --> 10:07.858
and you'll see different.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.111
Well, I'm old enough
to know what love is, so…

10:11.987 --> 10:14.114
Really? And who taught you that?

10:15.449 --> 10:16.450
You.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.955
I-I love you, Ptolemy. I do.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.668
And I bet that if I was 20 years older,

10:26.752 --> 10:29.046
and you were 50 years younger,

10:29.129 --> 10:33.133
I could-- I could see us being together,
you and me.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.516
You ever--
You ever felt like that about somebody?

10:45.896 --> 10:51.235
My first little girlfriend,
Maude, I guess.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.196
Yeah. And you know
how I feel about Sensia.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.280
Yeah.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.116
But you--

10:58.992 --> 11:00.410
You the--

11:00.494 --> 11:03.330
You the first woman that ever loved me.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.002
Loved me un-- un--

11:09.086 --> 11:10.796
Unconditional?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.715
Yeah, that. Unconditional.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.635
Yeah.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.599
And that's the kind of love
I-- I hope I remember when I slip back.

11:26.770 --> 11:30.440
Okay, but you--
you need to be running toward your future,

11:30.524 --> 11:33.777
grabbing hold of whatever's out there
in the world for you.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.447
It's good to be young.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.576
And something to be said
for being old too.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.037
Oh, yeah?
What's so good about it, old man?

11:44.121 --> 11:47.457
Well, old folk know where shit come from
and why it's there.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.418
And what else?

11:51.378 --> 11:56.175
Old folks ain't scared of life,
'cause they got one foot in the grave.

12:00.262 --> 12:03.390
Look here. You need to get some sleep.
We got a big day tomorrow.

12:03.473 --> 12:08.395
I got some new folks I want you to meet
and learn some old tricks.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.274
-Want a little drink before you go in?
-No.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.318
You know
you should not be drinking that much.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.820
You know you can't save me neither.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.698
Yeah, but it don't mean I can't try.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.159
Good night.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.411
Good night. Sleep tight.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.413
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.001
They do, they gonna get drunk.

12:50.354 --> 12:54.358
-Who the fuck is this?
-This Ptolemy Grey for Nina.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.485
You know what fucking time it is?

12:56.568 --> 12:58.403
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry about that,

12:58.487 --> 13:01.156
but I-I got something important
I want to say to her.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.046
-Hello?
-Papa Grey?

13:17.422 --> 13:18.507
Yeah, that's me.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.551
It's Nina. Nina Lloyd.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.053
How you get my number so fast?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.263
It's on my phone.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.307
What? Yo-- Your phone know who call you?

13:27.391 --> 13:28.934
All phones do.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.018
What? They do?

13:30.936 --> 13:35.774
Listen, I'm sorry about Alfred.
He gets protective of people calling me.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.150
That's your boyfriend?

13:37.234 --> 13:38.694
No, not at all. Just--

13:38.777 --> 13:41.071
Just a friend of the family,
you know, helping out.

13:41.989 --> 13:46.451
Did Niecie call you, tell you
about the eulogy I'm having for Reggie?

13:46.535 --> 13:50.414
She did, but--
Listen, I don't think I can come.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.374
It's still hard, you know?

13:52.457 --> 13:55.627
Yeah, I know.
Like a-- Like a wound won't heal.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.462
Yeah.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.632
Well, listen,
the repast start at three o'clock.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.342
If-- If you can meet me at 2:00,

14:02.426 --> 14:04.928
I-- I promise
I won't take up much of your time.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.014
I just wanna give you some money.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.975
I don't understand. What-- What money?

14:10.058 --> 14:12.603
The money I was saving
for Reggie, your husband.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.023
It's enough to take care of you
and the kids for a couple months.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.028
-Two o'clock, you say?
-Yeah. Two o'clock.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.252
I knew I'd catch you out here
reading a book.

14:37.336 --> 14:38.879
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.381
Can you get us a bus schedule?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.802
No, I-I-I asked
could you get us a bus schedule.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.471
Yeah, that's what I'm doing, Uncle.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.515
You finna call the bus company?

14:49.598 --> 14:51.642
No. I'ma download it.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.186
-Say what?
-Download.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.688
Like, the Internet. Ever heard of it?

14:56.772 --> 14:59.107
Yeah, I done heard of it,
but I ain't never used it.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.901
Okay, let me show you. Where you going?

15:00.984 --> 15:03.612
-We're gonna go to Buckhead.
-Okay.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.282
That's it, right there. Number 44.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.161
Look just like it used to look.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.872
Now we gotta hope he still in here.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.834
-All right. Well, come on.
-I'm coming. I'm coming.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.676
Excuse me. You need the exercise.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.386
All the way up there?

15:27.469 --> 15:28.637
You can do it.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.721
Shit.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.724
Come on.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.769
Look at you.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.399
-Child.
-You did it.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.276
-My legs hurt.
-I knew you could.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.361
Yes, I did.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.364
We here to see Mr. Abromovitz.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.242
-Do you have an appointment?
-No.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.828
What's your business with Mr. Abromovitz?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.496
He's still a lawyer, ain't he?

15:54.580 --> 15:56.874
Yes, he is, but you can't just walk
in here off the street--

15:56.957 --> 16:00.794
-Moishe! Moishe! You back there?
-Sir. Please. Sir, I will call the police.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.379
-Moi--
-Is there a problem?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.755
Junior?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.841
Mr. Grey?

16:05.924 --> 16:07.342
Where your dad at?

16:07.426 --> 16:10.095
He died abou-- 15 years ago.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.680
He was a young man.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.974
We-- Well, he was 69 at the time.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.225
Come here.

16:15.309 --> 16:19.938
I-I can't believe it's you.
This truly is a welcome surprise.

16:20.772 --> 16:21.773
You looking good.

16:26.403 --> 16:30.949
And this woman I was gardening for
accused me of stealing from her.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.659
They put me in jail and everything.

16:32.743 --> 16:36.163
I got one of them--
court-appointed lawyers.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.916
Son of a bitch wanted me to plead guilty.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.584
Told the judge and everything.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.127
Yeah. Well, luckily for Mr. Grey,

16:42.211 --> 16:45.631
my father was there to represent
my uncle Shmuel for embezzlement.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.008
He heard Mr. Grey arguing with his lawyer.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.551
Gerald Watts.

16:49.635 --> 16:52.721
Yes. Wow, Mr. Watts.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.641
My father asked Mr. Grey
if he'd like a different attorney.

16:55.724 --> 16:56.808
What about your uncle?

16:56.892 --> 16:58.977
Shmuel? No, he was guilty.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.188
Only thing they had to settle on
was the amount of the fine.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.941
So-- So, what is it
they thought you stole?

17:04.023 --> 17:08.278
-A statuette by--
-Degas who they said made it.

17:08.362 --> 17:12.449
But Moishe Senior stayed on the case
for ten months.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.954
He finally got one of the woman's nieces
to admit the woman, Sadie Holman,

17:17.037 --> 17:18.789
had stole it her own damn self…

17:18.872 --> 17:20.999
-What?
-…and was selling it on the sly.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.627
What, so she went to jail?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.588
No. No, my father just got her
to drop the charges.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.048
But she was guilty.

17:28.131 --> 17:32.261
Well, some people, even criminals,
are unlikely to ever see a conviction,

17:32.344 --> 17:33.971
much less the inside of a jail.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.182
So, what can I do for you?

17:39.268 --> 17:40.769
Can you make me a will?

17:40.853 --> 17:42.938
Of course. Are there many heirs?

17:43.021 --> 17:47.192
A few, but I want Robyn here
to be in charge of who gets what, when.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.444
Wait. Me?

17:49.945 --> 17:50.946
No.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.698
Is this a considerable sum?

17:53.282 --> 17:56.159
It is, but your daddy knew all about it.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.289
When going over a will,

18:00.372 --> 18:04.418
it is my practice to discuss
the particulars with the testator alone.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.627
I'm sure you understand.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.424
Yeah, I'm gonna be right outside.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.891
What is this young woman to you?

18:25.647 --> 18:28.108
Robyn come into my life

18:28.192 --> 18:33.530
when I needed someone to care
for me very, very badly.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.824
I was in bad shape, Mo.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.786
She pulled me out of a deep, deep hole.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.624
And I-- I sorta adopted her.

18:45.918 --> 18:51.465
But I trust Robyn with my life,
way more than I trust my own kinfolk.

18:52.257 --> 18:56.678
I understand your feelings for this girl,
but do others share your conviction?

18:56.762 --> 18:57.888
Namely, your family?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.806
What are the chances they'll contest?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.893
One hundred percent.

19:05.354 --> 19:09.608
I got a niece
who got a no-account-ass son.

19:09.691 --> 19:13.946
I got another great-grandnephew
that got killed,

19:14.029 --> 19:18.700
left two children and a wife,
which I ain't sure about.

19:19.785 --> 19:24.414
But I do know that anything I leave
to them, they gonna piss away.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.625
You're sure about this?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.961
Yeah, they don't know
how to handle money like that.

19:29.044 --> 19:33.298
So, I'ma leave
some specific instructions with Robyn,

19:33.382 --> 19:36.426
but they still gonna say
I was outta my mind.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.763
You seem of sound mind to me.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.142
And a trust could be set up
that would satisfy the courts,

19:44.226 --> 19:46.812
if not any expectations
on your family's part.

19:46.895 --> 19:48.230
Good! That's what I want.

19:48.313 --> 19:53.610
All right. Now, there's one more thing
that you can help me with.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.310
Place still look the same.

20:37.571 --> 20:41.491
What's in this here box is all about you.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.203
Gentlemen, your keys.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.085
Coydog, found the treasure.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.018
The Brasher Doubloon.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.979
My father's records indicate

21:11.063 --> 21:13.815
that Mr. Grey declared this coin
40 years ago.

21:13.899 --> 21:14.942
As his property.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.277
He paid the taxes,
even though we advised against it.

21:17.361 --> 21:18.904
The current worth?

21:18.987 --> 21:20.364
17.29 million.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.491
-Dollars?
-Yes.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.077
And there are seven other
less valuable coins in another box,

21:25.160 --> 21:26.411
and the same keys work on that.

21:26.495 --> 21:28.205
Let's not worry about them right now.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.875
But we're gonna get the ball rolling
by cashing this here one in

21:31.959 --> 21:36.296
and turning that into a trust account
that Robyn here manage.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.675
-No, no, no. We need to talk about this.
-Don't worry. Don't worry about it.

21:39.758 --> 21:42.594
-Don't worry? Don't I get a say?
-Of course you do.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.179
Then, thank you, but no thank you.

21:44.263 --> 21:47.099
Why are you asking him?
Look, you ain't gotta do nothing just yet.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.518
Yeah, but what if I still feel
the same way later?

21:49.601 --> 21:51.478
As disappointing as that may be
to Mr. Grey,

21:51.562 --> 21:53.939
I assure you,
the trust will remain in good hands.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.232
How-- How so?

21:55.315 --> 21:59.111
Well, if you refuse custodianship,
the responsibility will simply fall to me.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.572
If she refuse.

22:06.869 --> 22:09.454
How is this any different
than what you already doing

22:09.538 --> 22:10.914
with my alligator bag money?

22:10.998 --> 22:13.041
That money's in the bank,
and you hold the card.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.211
Look, I know it's a lot of money.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.047
It's a fucking fortune.
I can't be messing with that.

22:19.131 --> 22:20.465
But it's all in my will.

22:20.549 --> 22:23.719
Everything you need to do is right there.
It'd be just like I'm there with you.

22:23.802 --> 22:25.095
Yeah, but you won't be.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.980
Look, everybody gonna get their piece.

22:35.063 --> 22:38.066
You gonna get a chunk,
then a salary to write checks every month.

22:38.150 --> 22:41.153
Shirley Wring, Billy's friends,
they gonna get something.

22:41.236 --> 22:44.031
It's-- It's-- It's like
you gonna be taking care of everybody.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.699
How you expecting me to do all that?

22:45.782 --> 22:48.952
I couldn't even barely understand a word
the lawyers was talkin' about.

22:49.036 --> 22:52.080
You smarter than anybody in that room.
Plus, you know, Moishe know everything.

22:52.164 --> 22:53.665
And I'm just supposed to trust him?

22:53.749 --> 22:56.043
If you don't, get a second opinion.
Third if you want.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.920
You're not hearing me.
I don't want the money.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.254
I don't want any of it.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.089
You didn't wanna come
to a house smell like shit,

23:01.173 --> 23:02.674
bugs treading all over everything,

23:02.758 --> 23:06.053
talking to a crazy old man didn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground neither,

23:06.136 --> 23:07.137
but you did.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.306
And you did it
'cause you was the only one could do it.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.892
I did it 'cause I had to.
I ain't had nowhere else to go.

23:11.975 --> 23:14.520
And I cleaned up this mess
'cause I didn't wanna stay in it.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.355
I didn't do it
'cause I'm some kind of saint,

23:16.438 --> 23:18.065
and still you keep on-- You keep on--

23:18.148 --> 23:20.442
-Keep on-- Keep on what?
-Seeing me for something that I'm not!

23:20.526 --> 23:22.819
-I see you for who you is!
-No, you don't!

23:22.903 --> 23:24.988
Everything I've done, it's been about you.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.990
Not about me or how I feel.

23:27.074 --> 23:28.951
'Cause if you-- If you really saw me,

23:29.034 --> 23:31.787
you would see that I'm 17 years old,
and I'm not ready.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.789
You doing to me what Coydog did to you.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.458
-That's why I know how you feel.
-Then why you making me do it?

23:36.542 --> 23:39.378
You free to do whatever you want, okay?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.839
I'm just asking for your consideration.

23:41.922 --> 23:46.677
Just consider, just maybe, just maybe,
I know what I'm talking about.

24:01.358 --> 24:02.901
What's up? Come on.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.241
Mom.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.830
-Robyn!
-Robyn!

24:14.913 --> 24:16.123
-Hi!
-Hey.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.458
-Hey, Pitypapa. Billy.
-I'm sorry.

24:18.542 --> 24:19.626
Robyn.

24:20.669 --> 24:21.879
Nina here?

24:21.962 --> 24:23.672
She a little bit late.

24:23.755 --> 24:26.884
So, we gonna have it
in here in the living room?

24:26.967 --> 24:30.179
Well, not as many people gonna come
as last time. So I thought, yeah.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.931
-You got some food?
-Out back.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.019
What happened to you, Pitypapa?

24:37.936 --> 24:41.356
I mean, you not
as feeble-minded as you was,

24:41.440 --> 24:44.651
but you're not the same man
you were before neither.

24:44.735 --> 24:45.736
I ain't?

24:45.819 --> 24:46.904
No.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.031
-Hey!
-Mommy!

24:49.114 --> 24:51.617
Oh, my God! You guys look so nice.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.743
What's wrong?

24:52.826 --> 24:54.870
Artie took my doll
and pulled her pigtails.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.830
Arthur, did you do that
to your sister's dolls?

24:56.914 --> 24:59.249
Yeah, but she threw
my play gun on the ground.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.459
-Nuh-uh.
-All right, okay.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.793
-Okay. Hey.
-You did.

25:01.877 --> 25:03.712
I think the only way to settle this is

25:03.795 --> 25:06.423
to see which one of you can eat
the most ice cream, huh?

25:06.507 --> 25:08.133
-Yeah.
-I'll take 'em to the store.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.968
-Get you some ice cream.
-Thanks, Robyn.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.055
You coming?

25:13.138 --> 25:16.183
No, baby. I'm gonna stay here
and talk to Papa Grey.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.435
-Please?
-Then we're gonna all eat together, okay?

25:18.519 --> 25:19.520
Okay!

25:20.604 --> 25:21.688
Beautiful children.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.232
Yeah. They're my heart.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.235
You mind if we go in the back and talk?

25:26.318 --> 25:28.403
-No, go ahead.
-Okay.

25:28.487 --> 25:29.488
Come on.

25:44.962 --> 25:46.129
I understand this--

25:46.922 --> 25:49.883
Last time we was here,
this room here was hell.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.887
-Yeah.
-But, come on. Come on in. Come.

26:02.896 --> 26:06.984
That was the first time
you and me actually met each other too.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.863
Yeah, it's not like I never wanted to.
It's just that…

26:11.780 --> 26:14.199
Well, Reggie,
he didn't want me coming over.

26:14.992 --> 26:17.661
Said he didn't want me to see you
in the condition you was in.

26:18.996 --> 26:20.664
-I figured as much.
-Yeah.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.376
I still feel like I got to know you.

26:24.459 --> 26:28.672
That's how much you was in Reggie's heart.
You know, he told me all about you.

26:30.549 --> 26:33.635
He told me about all the things
you taught him over the years.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.638
You know, he still has--

26:37.556 --> 26:40.934
well, had those children books
you gave him when he was little.

26:43.228 --> 26:45.147
Said whenever you'd come over to babysit,

26:45.230 --> 26:47.774
he'd pull 'em out,
and you'd read 'em to him.

26:47.858 --> 26:51.904
Till he got big enough,
and I made him read 'em to me.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.241
Yeah, he was sweet like that.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.036
Yeah.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.504
This here, this is $5,000.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.256
It's for you and the children.

27:13.634 --> 27:16.178
Reggie loved them babies.

27:17.095 --> 27:20.265
Last thing he said to me was
it was Latisha's birthday.

27:20.349 --> 27:23.143
He had to rush home
to get some party favors.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.605
Yeah.

27:28.482 --> 27:31.735
Look, I-- I know
it's hard for you to be here…

27:33.904 --> 27:36.907
but I would really appreciate it

27:36.990 --> 27:39.660
if you would stay
and hear what I had to say.

27:40.786 --> 27:45.874
It's as much for you
and them children as it is for Reggie.

27:47.835 --> 27:49.545
But I understand if you can't.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.421
No, I-I'll-- I'll stay.

27:54.550 --> 27:55.551
Thank you.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.135
No, thank you.

27:58.637 --> 28:00.806
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah.

28:03.809 --> 28:05.727
I guess you better get on back.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.438
Thanks.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.534
We got a whole thing of chocolate.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.744
-I like the chocolate.
-Who likes chocolate?

28:22.828 --> 28:24.329
-Me.
-Not me.

28:24.413 --> 28:26.790
Well, if you don't,
then I'll eat the whole thing.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.458
Eat the whole thing by yourself?

28:28.542 --> 28:29.585
-Yep.
-That's crazy.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.045
-Give this to your mama.
-I'm gonna get a stomachache.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.255
Am I too late?

28:33.881 --> 28:35.716
No. It-- It ain't even started yet.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.762
Do you wanna go for a walk?

28:40.846 --> 28:41.847
-Sure.
-Okay.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.478
You know Papa Grey is sick, right?

28:49.813 --> 28:52.024
I thought he was better
with the new meds and all.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.776
Well, that was just a temporary fix.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.528
Ain't nothing the doctors can do?

28:57.321 --> 29:00.199
No, but we already knew it was coming. So…

29:02.743 --> 29:03.911
Don't seem fair.

29:03.994 --> 29:05.871
Well, shit ain't ever fair.

29:08.332 --> 29:09.708
It's just real.

29:10.834 --> 29:14.838
People suffer, and then they die,
and then nobody give a fuck.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.302
My mother had cancer.

29:21.637 --> 29:25.641
She hurt so bad that if you just breathe
on her sometimes, she'd cry out in pain.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.771
My father walk in the room,
and she'd look at him,

29:31.939 --> 29:34.650
scared he might touch her
or say something too loud.

29:37.277 --> 29:40.030
One day, she waved to him to come close.

29:40.989 --> 29:43.825
And when he did,
she begged him to kill her.

29:45.577 --> 29:46.620
Begged him.

29:47.371 --> 29:48.830
You see? That's terrible.

29:50.374 --> 29:52.417
Here you are
with the person you love the most,

29:52.501 --> 29:55.128
and the best thing that you could do
for 'em is kill 'em?

29:55.212 --> 29:56.380
How's that right?

29:56.880 --> 29:57.881
I don't know.

29:59.716 --> 30:02.636
You know, I saw something in my father
sitting next to my mother.

30:02.719 --> 30:03.720
What was that?

30:04.805 --> 30:06.139
She could ask him anything

30:07.057 --> 30:09.893
because they were everything
to one another.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.440
We should all be so lucky
to find a love like that, that deep.

30:17.568 --> 30:20.153
I know I wouldn't mind
knowing something like that.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.240
I mean, not saying us.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.909
Not yet.

30:26.994 --> 30:28.120
You can't be serious.

30:30.205 --> 30:33.333
Is it so crazy?
The thought of me and you being together?

30:33.417 --> 30:34.668
Wait.

30:39.006 --> 30:40.215
Together how?

30:40.924 --> 30:45.804
Like, you love me so much
you wanna kill me, together?

30:47.598 --> 30:49.433
I just wanna know what this is.

30:51.101 --> 30:53.979
Listen, I like you, and you sweet.

30:54.062 --> 30:59.985
And it's been fun,
but I got a lot of stuff I gotta do.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.158
Well, what you grinning about?

31:09.077 --> 31:13.540
My father asked my mother to marry him
six times before she said "yes."

31:16.001 --> 31:18.545
I mean, I'm not saying that's us.
I'm just saying.

31:22.508 --> 31:23.592
You stupid.

31:24.635 --> 31:25.719
Come on.

31:27.638 --> 31:29.056
Miss Barnet.

31:29.139 --> 31:30.599
What are you doing here?

31:30.682 --> 31:33.101
Mr. Grey. He invited me.

31:33.185 --> 31:35.729
He said that I might be interested
in what he had to say.

31:36.772 --> 31:38.482
I'm just as surprised as anybody.

31:41.235 --> 31:44.321
This is Dr. Rubin.
He's Uncle's memory doctor.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.115
-Lovely to meet you.
-How you doing?

31:47.199 --> 31:48.200
Good.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.077
He has a name. It's Roger.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.161
-Roger.
-Roger.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.746
Yeah, nice to meet you.

31:55.958 --> 31:58.418
-Uncle. Hey.
-Hey.

32:00.504 --> 32:01.922
Hey, Satan.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.298
Hello, Mr. Grey. How are you?

32:03.382 --> 32:06.510
Every day I got a clear thought,
testament to you.

32:07.886 --> 32:09.179
Thanks for coming.

32:09.263 --> 32:10.639
Yes, okay.

32:12.683 --> 32:13.851
-Hello.
-Hi.

32:17.312 --> 32:20.524
Okay, thank you, everyone,

32:20.607 --> 32:23.610
for finding it in your hearts
to be here again.

32:23.694 --> 32:24.903
Last time we were together,

32:24.987 --> 32:30.117
my uncle, Pitypapa, Mr. Ptolemy Grey,
wasn't feeling very well.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.535
But now he's better,

32:31.618 --> 32:34.621
and he wanted to say
what he didn't get a chance to.

32:35.455 --> 32:39.459
Now, I think we owe it,
not just to Pitypapa, but to Reggie,

32:39.543 --> 32:44.047
to lend an ear to his favorite uncle,
something Reggie himself loved to do.

32:44.923 --> 32:45.924
Go ahead.

32:50.095 --> 32:52.055
-Hey, y'all.
-Hey, Mr. Grey.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.393
The onliest reason I'm standing here is

32:56.476 --> 32:59.938
'cause of my great-grandnephew,
Reggie Lloyd.

33:00.022 --> 33:01.356
Amen.

33:01.940 --> 33:04.443
Reggie took care of me

33:04.526 --> 33:08.780
when nobody else could stand
the stink in my house

33:08.864 --> 33:10.866
or the stench from my body.

33:12.618 --> 33:16.163
He was one of those great Black men
that lived in our neighborhoods

33:16.246 --> 33:19.291
that looked out for old folks
and children.

33:21.084 --> 33:25.339
He was a good man
who stayed in a place too long.

33:27.424 --> 33:32.387
I have never been that kind of man.

33:35.307 --> 33:38.143
I was married
to a woman named Sensia Howard.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.314
Folks said she was no good.

33:42.397 --> 33:44.733
She run the streets. She spent my money.

33:46.276 --> 33:48.904
She didn't give a damn
about nobody but herself.

33:48.987 --> 33:51.949
She didn't care about me and nobody else.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.827
Niecie, your mama told me
I should leave her

33:55.911 --> 33:58.914
'cause I deserved
a woman better than that.

34:00.541 --> 34:06.338
But your mother wasn't at my house
the night Doris Hind came to my door.

34:11.176 --> 34:13.679
Hey. Hi, Miss Wring.

34:13.762 --> 34:18.559
Doris was a heartbroken young woman
whose mama had just died.

34:20.726 --> 34:25.815
Her mother, Cora Patterson,
told her on her deathbed

34:26.900 --> 34:30.362
that she was my child.

34:31.780 --> 34:34.699
Cora had been my girl for a while,

34:35.826 --> 34:39.705
but I left her
when Sensia came into my life.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.251
But I could see Doris was mine.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.045
But I ain't hug her.

34:48.630 --> 34:51.507
I ain't throw open my doors
and say, "Come on in!"

34:53.886 --> 34:55.094
I said…

34:57.014 --> 35:01.602
"I'm sorry,
but your mother must have been mistaken."

35:03.979 --> 35:07.524
And I closed the door in her face.

35:10.068 --> 35:13.238
As she went down the stairs,
she ran into Sensia.

35:15.365 --> 35:18.577
And my bride could see me in her face.

35:19.661 --> 35:22.456
She put her arms
around that blubbering girl

35:22.539 --> 35:24.291
and brought her back upstairs.

35:26.293 --> 35:29.087
Sensia loved her where I couldn't.

35:30.547 --> 35:35.552
I just resented her
and her interruption into our lives,

35:35.636 --> 35:36.887
and I showed it.

35:39.056 --> 35:42.392
Doris hated me till her dying day.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.437
She was 42 years old.

35:46.605 --> 35:48.440
But I didn't go to her funeral

35:49.441 --> 35:52.945
'cause I didn't even know she was dead
for a few years.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.866
But I didn't call y'all here
to talk about my troubles.

35:57.950 --> 36:00.994
But I tell you about Doris for a reason.

36:03.372 --> 36:07.584
It is a great injustice that I stand here

36:09.169 --> 36:12.172
while Reggie lay in the cold ground.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.386
He was a good man
who deserved a good life.

36:18.220 --> 36:21.974
He deserved the loving wife and children.

36:24.142 --> 36:26.144
He ain't deserve the fate he got.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.022
I owe Reggie my life.

36:30.691 --> 36:34.945
And that is a deep debt
that I intend to pay in full.

36:36.989 --> 36:40.075
So, I called y'all here to bear witness

36:41.076 --> 36:46.707
that I, Ptolemy Roberts Grey,
will do everything I can

36:46.790 --> 36:51.295
to make sure
Reggie's bloodline has every chance

36:52.629 --> 36:57.843
in a world where folk don't give a damn
whether we live or die.

37:01.054 --> 37:04.433
If these children grow up to be
half the man their daddy was,

37:05.517 --> 37:08.312
then everybody here'll be in a-- a wor--

37:08.937 --> 37:12.191
Everybody here'll live--

37:14.359 --> 37:20.741
Everybody here will--
will live in a world that--

37:22.409 --> 37:26.663
Everybody's life i-in…in the world--

37:34.129 --> 37:40.385
We'll-- We'll live in a world that will be
a better-- better place to live in.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.395
Thank y'all. Let's eat.

38:02.449 --> 38:03.450
You all right?

38:04.076 --> 38:07.371
No, but that's as it should be.

38:09.581 --> 38:12.167
That girl, Doris.

38:12.251 --> 38:13.627
My daughter, Doris?

38:14.461 --> 38:16.088
Your daughter, Doris.

38:16.964 --> 38:21.301
In all that time, you ain't never try
to make things right with her?

38:21.969 --> 38:23.011
Not once?

38:24.638 --> 38:25.639
No.

38:29.643 --> 38:31.270
What happened to her? How she die?

38:33.230 --> 38:37.234
She committed suicide.

38:52.916 --> 38:54.376
You hate me now?

38:56.461 --> 38:58.422
You know better than to ask me that.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.262
You know,
Roger decided to get serious with me

39:05.345 --> 39:07.598
and started talking about us
like we a thing.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.016
Well, you is, ain't you?

39:09.850 --> 39:11.268
I do not want to hear that.

39:13.395 --> 39:14.730
Tell him about your money?

39:15.522 --> 39:16.648
What money?

39:18.692 --> 39:20.611
So you done made up your mind about that.

39:24.198 --> 39:26.491
Can we please not talk
about this right now?

39:27.993 --> 39:30.245
I still got faith you gonna come around.

39:31.914 --> 39:32.915
Look at 'em.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.418
Where their mama at?

39:37.127 --> 39:38.378
Hey!

39:38.462 --> 39:39.671
I'll see if I can find her.

39:41.590 --> 39:42.758
You got a dress on.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.066
Nina?

40:02.694 --> 40:04.905
-Papa Grey.
-What you doing out here by yourself?

40:04.988 --> 40:06.823
Everybody in the back where the food's at.

40:08.408 --> 40:10.452
Yeah, I was just-- I was just thinking.

40:11.745 --> 40:16.250
I wanna thank you for staying.
I hope I said a few things right.

40:17.668 --> 40:18.669
More than a few.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.966
You could hear it, you know?
How much you really loved him.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.385
Well, I wasn't the onliest one.

40:27.344 --> 40:28.470
Far from it.

40:28.554 --> 40:31.682
Yeah. He really loved you too.
I hope you know that.

40:34.309 --> 40:35.310
I do.

40:35.936 --> 40:39.773
Matter of fact, he loved you so much

40:40.649 --> 40:43.861
that when he found out
another man had his eye on you,

40:44.820 --> 40:47.322
he decided he was gonna move you
down to Texas.

40:50.492 --> 40:51.994
I'm sorry. What?

40:52.077 --> 40:53.912
One of the last things he told me.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.624
What did you say?

40:57.708 --> 40:59.751
What you think I should've said?

41:01.920 --> 41:03.297
I don't know.

41:05.424 --> 41:09.636
You know, I-- I went down there
where Reggie got murdered,

41:10.387 --> 41:12.806
and I found the woman
who seen what happened.

41:13.891 --> 41:19.897
She said the man what did it was
brown-skinned with short, spiky hair

41:19.980 --> 41:22.024
and had a scar over his eye.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.820
Did she hear a name?

41:34.119 --> 41:37.289
I don't see Reggie's truck
parked out front here.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.832
Drive yourself over here?

41:40.042 --> 41:41.043
No.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.878
So you was dropped off then.

41:44.171 --> 41:45.214
Yeah.

41:46.173 --> 41:47.841
Family friend, Alfred?

41:52.429 --> 41:53.639
I'm going inside.

41:53.722 --> 41:54.765
Did you tell Alfred

41:54.848 --> 41:58.227
that Reggie was planning on moving you
and the kids to Texas?

41:58.977 --> 42:01.522
I didn't tell anybody
about Reggie's plans for us.

42:02.314 --> 42:04.691
Was Alfred with you
the night Reggie was killed?

42:06.652 --> 42:10.239
I'm a good woman, Mr. Grey. A mother.

42:10.322 --> 42:14.409
Was Alfred with you when that bullet tore
through Reggie's brain?

42:14.493 --> 42:15.869
I'm a good woman!

42:17.246 --> 42:18.997
What was Alfred in prison for?

42:19.665 --> 42:22.543
What? Who told you that?

42:22.626 --> 42:23.961
That ain't no answer.

42:24.711 --> 42:26.463
What do you want me to say?

42:26.547 --> 42:29.967
Did you tell him
Reggie was trying to take you away?

42:30.050 --> 42:32.427
-No, I--
-What he say? You got to stay?

42:32.511 --> 42:34.471
What he tell you? That you was his woman?

42:34.555 --> 42:37.933
That you wasn't going no goddamn where?
That you belong to him?

42:38.016 --> 42:39.726
-Did you know?
-No!

42:39.810 --> 42:41.562
Well, did you suspect?

42:45.858 --> 42:47.860
-I asked him.
-And what he say?

42:51.238 --> 42:52.322
He slapped me.

42:54.616 --> 42:55.701
Knocked me down.

42:57.327 --> 42:59.580
And that's the man you wanna cling to?

43:02.374 --> 43:04.418
I was 13 years old.

43:05.711 --> 43:08.255
I'd just turned 13 when me and Alfred met,

43:08.338 --> 43:10.257
and he--

43:13.260 --> 43:15.804
What am I supposed to say
to a man like that, huh?

43:18.724 --> 43:21.143
I loved Reggie. I did.

43:21.810 --> 43:22.853
I do, but…

43:24.313 --> 43:26.023
but with Alfred, it's just--

43:27.774 --> 43:30.068
I just-- I can't explain it.

43:36.533 --> 43:39.161
Whatever the truth is,
I swear I didn't know.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.580
So, what am I supposed to do?

43:43.040 --> 43:45.250
My uncle Coydog used to say,

43:45.334 --> 43:47.794
"You got to let the river
take its course."

43:49.713 --> 43:51.381
Well, what does that mean?

43:51.465 --> 43:52.883
I don't know.

43:52.966 --> 43:54.676
I used to ask him the same thing.

43:55.511 --> 43:59.556
He said, "We all in that river, boy.

44:01.183 --> 44:03.310
And the river know
right where it's going."

44:21.453 --> 44:22.955
Hey.

44:23.622 --> 44:24.706
Thanks for coming.

44:25.707 --> 44:26.875
Are you okay?

44:28.710 --> 44:30.879
I liked what you had to say
in your speech.

44:31.839 --> 44:35.133
Sounds like you've come to terms
with some truths in your life.

44:36.260 --> 44:37.678
I don't know about that.

44:38.470 --> 44:42.140
Well, at least it seems like you're ready
to admit that I was right.

44:44.184 --> 44:45.269
You're a good man.

44:45.936 --> 44:47.396
A good man?

44:48.397 --> 44:53.151
Yeah, here I am sitting here
holding your hand like we got a future

44:53.235 --> 44:56.154
when the doctor done told me
my days is numbered.

44:58.282 --> 45:00.826
You think
an old woman like me doesn't know

45:00.909 --> 45:03.161
that any day might be her last one?

45:10.711 --> 45:13.213
It's been really great meeting you.

45:16.550 --> 45:18.427
I'll let you go talk to your guest.

45:18.927 --> 45:19.928
I'll be back.

45:25.267 --> 45:28.937
I don't think I've ever been to an event
where I was the only white guy there.

45:30.939 --> 45:34.443
What you said in there was,
was very moving.

45:35.027 --> 45:37.154
It was painfully honest.

45:37.237 --> 45:39.907
You did seem to drift there, though,
for a minute or two.

45:39.990 --> 45:43.827
Yeah. Yeah, I'm-- I'm coming to the end.

45:45.245 --> 45:48.957
Tell me something, Ptolemy.
Why did you invite me here?

45:50.584 --> 45:55.172
Well, the old folks used to say,
"You got to give the devil his due."

45:56.798 --> 45:58.926
And you are sacrificing my life.

46:01.178 --> 46:04.431
Your sacrifice will save
millions of lives up the line, Ptolemy.

46:05.224 --> 46:06.433
Will it?

46:07.893 --> 46:12.439
I used to think I had to save
all the Black folks in America

46:12.523 --> 46:15.150
'cause of something a great man stole.

46:15.859 --> 46:18.320
-But you changed your mind?
-No.

46:18.403 --> 46:20.280
I have figured out, though,

46:20.364 --> 46:27.037
that what he wanted me to do was
to empower the peoples.

46:27.120 --> 46:33.919
To pass on the blessing more and more
until everybody was lifted--

46:39.216 --> 46:42.511
Lifted up. Excuse me.

46:42.594 --> 46:43.804
Yeah.

46:49.393 --> 46:51.478
-Excuse me.
-Alfred Gulla.

46:51.562 --> 46:53.564
What the fuck is wrong with you, old man?

46:53.647 --> 46:56.692
I went to that place
where my nephew was cut down.

46:56.775 --> 46:58.151
I met a woman who said

46:58.235 --> 47:03.657
a brown man with spiky hair
with a scar over his eye killed Reggie.

47:04.908 --> 47:06.910
Don't worry. I ain't told nobody.

47:06.994 --> 47:08.996
And the police, they don't give a damn.

47:09.663 --> 47:11.623
All right. So, what you want then?

47:12.791 --> 47:14.793
I gave your girlfriend some money.

47:14.877 --> 47:17.671
Why don't you take a look at that.
Come on by my place.

47:17.754 --> 47:19.047
Maybe we can make a deal.

47:19.548 --> 47:20.549
What kind of deal?

47:21.341 --> 47:25.095
I need to know that
Reggie's children gonna have a good life.

47:25.637 --> 47:29.766
And part of that means
that you can't be in the picture.

47:30.392 --> 47:34.062
Can't have them babies being raised
by the man what killed their daddy.

47:34.146 --> 47:37.357
-The boy is mine.
-That what she told you?

47:37.441 --> 47:41.570
The best parts of that boy come
from the good in my nephew.

47:42.154 --> 47:43.322
You a crazy old fool.

47:45.824 --> 47:46.825
That may be.

47:47.868 --> 47:53.290
But I'm willing to pay you good money
to stay away from Nina and them children.

47:54.583 --> 47:57.169
-How much money?
-Five times what I give her.

47:59.004 --> 48:01.507
What make you think
I'ma give up my woman for money?

48:01.590 --> 48:02.799
Nigga, please.

48:04.051 --> 48:06.094
You want the money.

48:09.306 --> 48:12.976
I'll be at my apartment
two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
