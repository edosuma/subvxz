You choose to save
other's lives

00:03.760 --> 00:06.912
at the expense of our own.

00:06.920 --> 00:10.072
I conspired in the plot
to burn New York City.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.231
Major Morehouse has agreed
to assist me

00:12.240 --> 00:13.674
<i>in my search for your mother.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.911
The only way I'd ever trust
a fellow like you

00:15.920 --> 00:17.320
<i>is if you took out
one of your own.</i>

00:18.880 --> 00:21.759
<i>Find the no-good
son-of-a-bitch who stabbed that boy!</i>

<i>Mornin' Miss Eva.</i>

01:56.880 --> 01:58.792
Where's Kevin?

01:59.880 --> 02:01.678
With Morehouse.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.200
Okay, liven up this cemetery,
huh?

02:13.480 --> 02:15.039
Kevin!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.232
Jesus H. Christ,

02:18.480 --> 02:19.880
is this what the protestants
call a honeymoon?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.473
Shut up.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.720
What's happened?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.951
Phinbar Byrnes uh...

02:29.240 --> 02:31.436
<i>Yeah? What of him?</i>

02:31.440 --> 02:33.511
<i>He's uh...</i>

02:33.520 --> 02:35.876
<i>The kid's been stabbed.</i>

02:35.880 --> 02:37.439
Gutted like a carp.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.636
When?

02:42.640 --> 02:43.756
Found his body his body
a few hours ago.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.911
The lads are in a rage.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.154
He made this soft
little noise when I stuck the blade in.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.592
Oh yeah.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.799
And, oh, that look
in their eyes

02:58.280 --> 03:01.432
when they realize
the hour has come.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.879
No one can ever believe
it's true.

03:03.880 --> 03:07.510
It's like they think,
"this has to be a mistake."

03:07.520 --> 03:08.715
Right, they do that,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.280
"can't be me
that's actually dying."

03:11.280 --> 03:13.033
Which is too bad,

03:14.040 --> 03:16.509
'cause we share a bond,

03:16.520 --> 03:19.194
the killer and the killed.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.717
Here's to the gone ones.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.191
Gone and sadly,
forgotten.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.596
<i>No witnesses! No leads!</i>

03:37.600 --> 03:40.274
So we just stand here
with our pricks in our hands?!

03:42.800 --> 03:43.950
Sorry, sir.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.758
Took your
sweet time getting here.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.472
What do you know
about young Byrnes?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.995
Did he have any enemies
to speak of?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.798
You found him
in Bottle Alley?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.280
Yeah, what of it?

03:55.280 --> 03:57.397
Billy Murphy
lives near there.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.319
Phinbar was trying
to court his daughter.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.312
Murphy's a fierce
cop hater.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.835
Ah, Phinbar,
you daft bastard.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.875
You men, go with Corcoran.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.991
Have a pleasant little chat
with Mister Murphy.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.988
And the rest of you,
what the hell are you doin'?!

04:23.440 --> 04:26.035
I thought you might have
worked up an appetite.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.839
Coppers are crawlin'
all over the points.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.830
Let's tuck in,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.514
you can tell me about
the departed Phinbar Byrnes.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.194
<i>All the gorgeous
and gory details.</i>

04:35.200 --> 04:37.874
Or you could leave us men
to drink in peace.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.236
You ever put your
hands on me again, boy,

04:46.240 --> 04:47.993
I'll chop it off you.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.199
Yer joking me.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.233
Here.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.515
Stay down, you prick!

05:07.520 --> 05:09.591
If it weren't for me,
you two wouldn't know each other!

05:09.600 --> 05:12.195
Yeah, uh?
Go on, ya wee lass.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.875
We'll ring a bell
for you when we need ya!

05:21.560 --> 05:25.839
The forger don't usually
like meetin' people,

05:26.720 --> 05:30.316
but you might just
be the exception, lad.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.912
My lady,
may I have this dance?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.511
- Why yes you may.
- Oh.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.156
Oh!

06:03.360 --> 06:05.158
<i>Ellen, that's mine!</i>

06:05.160 --> 06:07.595
Ellen, it's mine!
Ellen, please!

06:07.600 --> 06:09.114
You took this from
Elizabeth Morehouse?!

06:09.120 --> 06:10.110
That's mine!

06:10.120 --> 06:11.520
Ow!

06:11.520 --> 06:12.636
Oh, you thief!

06:12.640 --> 06:14.552
Agh! Ah!

06:14.560 --> 06:16.597
You give me back
that necklace!

06:16.600 --> 06:18.319
You are the devil's child!

06:18.320 --> 06:20.835
And you're a crazy old whore!

06:20.840 --> 06:22.194
Aghhh!

06:22.200 --> 06:23.350
Oh! Ah!

06:23.360 --> 06:24.589
Oh!

06:30.560 --> 06:33.314
I will teach you
how to behave!

06:33.320 --> 06:36.597
What? You gonna kill
me like you did Maggie?

06:48.000 --> 06:48.990
How do you
wanna play this, Corky?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.674
Annie?

06:53.640 --> 06:55.154
Oy!

06:55.160 --> 06:56.435
How you wanna play this?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.352
You break down the door
and we rush him.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.714
Minogue and Shultz
will go in the back.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.519
Glynn, follow that girl in
the blue dress, bring her to me.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.556
But we've got a cop killer--

07:03.560 --> 07:05.552
Find her and bring her to me!

07:06.640 --> 07:07.551
You ready?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.994
- Yeah.
- You ready?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.071
Agh! Murphy!

07:11.080 --> 07:13.993
- Don't move, Murphy!
- What the hell?!

07:14.000 --> 07:15.195
Arg!

07:17.360 --> 07:19.511
Mrs. Morehouse.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.796
I apologize,
I didn't mean to disturb you.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.480
Mrs. Sara Freeman
is in the drawing room.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.880
Agh!

07:28.880 --> 07:32.271
Would you ever quit
ticklin' me, ya gobshite?

07:35.800 --> 07:38.872
Just confess to what ya done

07:38.880 --> 07:40.997
and we'll all be finished here,
huh?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.911
Piss off, duchess.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.878
Let him stand, boys,
let him stand.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.680
Argh!

07:56.120 --> 07:57.634
Why Sara, hello.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.711
Mrs. Morehouse.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.189
I don't wish to bother you
during your honeymoon time,

08:02.200 --> 08:04.999
but you mentioned
I should call today...

08:05.000 --> 08:06.639
To get the rest
of the payment?

08:06.640 --> 08:09.519
Oh, yes, of course.
Sorry.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.956
You looked an absolute
beautiful bride.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.758
And Mr. Morehouse,

08:15.760 --> 08:19.231
his smile was proof
as to how much he loves you.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.831
Mrs. Morehouse,
are you not well?

08:26.520 --> 08:27.954
If the dress was...

08:27.960 --> 08:29.360
No.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.753
No, Sara,
the dress was lovely,

08:33.280 --> 08:34.999
truly.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.592
And I'm fine.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.270
Just a stream of emotions
that I'm not accustomed to.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.070
Robert left
after the ceremony,

08:59.920 --> 09:02.116
he never came home.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.634
Oh no.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.474
Oh no.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.191
We, have a dead cop.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.877
Do you think we're ever
gonna just go away?

09:13.160 --> 09:16.119
We know you threatened
to kill him

09:16.120 --> 09:17.952
if he went near
your daughter again.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.552
Do you hear that?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.711
Leave her alone!
She's nothing to do with this!

09:29.120 --> 09:31.157
Please don't hit
my father anymore.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.230
He's been here all night!

09:32.240 --> 09:34.630
Fiona,
keep your mouth shut!

09:34.640 --> 09:36.472
He ain't your man.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.960
There's a new gang
in the points.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.111
Shut up!
They'll kill us both!

09:43.400 --> 09:47.997
Men can sometimes act
out of fear.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.630
Or anger.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.870
You could not have
done anything

09:52.880 --> 09:54.872
to anger him so.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.920
You are clearly
a good woman.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.437
I can disappoint myself
at times.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.591
We all make mistakes,

10:06.040 --> 10:11.035
and the lure of those places
can be strong on a man

10:11.240 --> 10:13.311
in a moment of weakness.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.192
If it were up to me,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.112
I would raze
the entire sixth ward.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.957
push it into the harbor
and be done with it.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.840
I must steel myself,

10:25.840 --> 10:28.514
go down and retrieve
my husband.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.832
I'm sorry,
my problems are not yours.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.874
Please let me get
you your money.

10:42.800 --> 10:43.950
- Listen...
- Mrs. Morehouse...

10:43.960 --> 10:45.394
A letter for you.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.869
- From Robert?
- No, ma'am.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.312
Is everything all right?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.350
Yes...

11:05.480 --> 11:08.791
A spark of good news
amidst the madness.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.516
We've found the plantation
to which your mother was sold.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.275
Listen, Copper,
leave my daughter be.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.316
She's just a lass!

11:29.320 --> 11:31.437
Shut yer trap!

11:31.440 --> 11:33.272
I'll catch up.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.959
Ellen...

11:37.240 --> 11:39.436
What happened in here?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.796
Please, Kevin,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.757
promise me that child
will not be allowed

11:43.760 --> 11:45.877
in this house again.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.874
Damn it, Ellen,

11:47.920 --> 11:49.036
this enmity between
the two of you--

11:49.040 --> 11:50.679
No.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.912
Do not place me
beside that brat.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.392
Annie stole Elizabeth
Morehouse's diamond necklace.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.471
I only tried to get
it from her and...

12:00.480 --> 12:01.709
And what?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.234
What did you do
to send her off?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.640
'Cause I saw
her running.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.677
Straight to hell I hope.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.637
How could you not see
the truth before you?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.199
She is a devious
little demon!

12:11.200 --> 12:14.796
No, she's a child
who doesn't know what she's doing.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.354
<i>What is this, Kevin?</i>

12:17.360 --> 12:19.670
She is not our Maggie.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.994
You will watch
what you say.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.275
Annie is a tramp!

12:25.280 --> 12:26.509
Oh!

12:31.600 --> 12:34.320
If you were half the man
you believe yourself to be,

12:34.320 --> 12:37.996
you'd worry about your wife,
not that little beast!

12:38.000 --> 12:40.071
I shouldn't have hit you.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.350
Ellen...

13:04.000 --> 13:05.275
Art...

13:07.880 --> 13:09.314
Art and commerce,

13:10.280 --> 13:13.273
that is the intersection
where we function, Mr. Maguire.

13:16.920 --> 13:17.797
Fair enough.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.311
Occasionally bloodletting
is part of the equation.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.431
You performed admirably.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.237
The murder of a copper cuts
to the very depths of society,

13:29.480 --> 13:30.596
the structure
of civilization,

13:30.840 --> 13:34.197
a direct assault
on public security.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.318
Are you familiar
with Schopenhauer?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.120
Is he your man that sells
that good schnitzel

13:39.160 --> 13:40.310
down on the bowery?

13:45.440 --> 13:47.033
Schopenhauer said...

13:49.280 --> 13:53.433
...That the world is driven
by dissatisfied will,

13:54.600 --> 13:58.480
<i>and that to be truly happy
one must eschew desire.</i>

13:59.400 --> 14:01.551
I find that most men
are incapable

14:01.680 --> 14:03.478
of such strong will,

14:03.720 --> 14:07.396
and that makes me happy...
and rich.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.559
Works of art,

14:10.760 --> 14:14.356
designed to facilitate
commerce.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.440
<i>I want the two of you to go to
the South Street dock at 6:00.</i>

14:17.600 --> 14:19.717
There'll be new printing plates
coming off the belle larue

14:19.720 --> 14:21.473
out of Marseilles.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.595
O'Rourke will fill
you in on the details.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.274
Done deal.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.837
C'mon, kid.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.874
That's for you.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.353
Yeah?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.718
Elizabeth Morehouse to see you.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.800
Oh, is she looking
for a job?

15:28.400 --> 15:31.438
You won't catch anything,
I run a clean joint.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.880
I'm looking for my husband,
Robert Morehouse,

15:36.160 --> 15:38.231
Major Robert Morehouse.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.276
I know that he sometimes...
drinks here.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.750
Didn't you two get married
just yesterday?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.230
Yes...

15:55.360 --> 15:56.840
Yesterday.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.074
I've heard of
the seven year itch,

16:03.080 --> 16:05.879
this must be
a world record then.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.717
I have money,
lots of it,

16:09.640 --> 16:12.109
earned by honest endeavor.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.797
Surely not earned
by you.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.277
As if it matters.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.469
I can pay you for any...
information.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.392
Spend your husband's money
on a Pinkerton

16:36.560 --> 16:39.120
to shadow him.
Or better,

16:39.120 --> 16:42.158
put it towards lessons
on how to keep the man happy.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.113
Wives are like whores
with a marriage certificate.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.917
Robert isn't here,
he hasn't been in ages.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.280
You best go.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.076
I found her with a
bunch of young'uns over on Dover.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.833
Got a mean right hook,
she does.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.194
A real hellion.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.600
I don't know what Ellen
told you but she's a liar.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.831
Mrs. Morehouse gave
me that necklace.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.035
She was drunk
so she won't remember,

17:37.040 --> 17:39.396
but she gave it
to me outright.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.878
Shut up, child.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.792
You know, and when
your Ellen accused me--

17:43.840 --> 17:46.355
I said shut up!

17:51.360 --> 17:54.034
The Murphy girl's talkin'.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.191
I'll be waitin' for ya.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.554
You see that?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.635
I asked
if you saw that!

18:16.360 --> 18:17.919
Right this minute...

18:17.920 --> 18:20.151
...I'm supposed to be
trackin' a murderer,

18:20.160 --> 18:22.391
a murderer who killed
one of my men.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.119
Instead,
I'm sitting here with you

18:24.120 --> 18:25.190
wondering what
it's gonna take for you

18:25.200 --> 18:26.350
to stop your bullshit.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.237
You know, Kevin--

18:27.240 --> 18:30.119
I offered you a chance
to grow up right

18:30.120 --> 18:32.271
in a good home.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.075
Another chance,
and another goddamn chance,

18:35.080 --> 18:37.436
and all those times...

18:37.440 --> 18:39.671
...you could have told me,
"go to hell,"

18:40.240 --> 18:42.038
because you continue
your ways.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.192
You pushed too far
this time, Annie.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.237
I don't know
if I can fix this.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.837
To be honest,
I don't...

18:57.840 --> 19:00.275
...know if I want
to fix it.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.115
I don't know why
I do what I do.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.478
Please,
don't give up on me yet.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.792
If you do,
I will just die.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.119
Really, in this world,

19:22.120 --> 19:26.592
you're the only one
who cares about me, Kevin.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.757
I'm gonna do my job.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.438
You sit here
and do not move

19:42.520 --> 19:44.477
and when I come back,

19:44.720 --> 19:47.599
we'll return this necklace
to Mrs. Morehouse.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.076
Glynn!

19:52.520 --> 19:53.795
Stay with the child.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.598
I'm not a babysitter.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.310
No, you're a goddamn
patrolman and I'm a goddamn detective.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.279
So?

20:06.720 --> 20:09.110
Pa told me not to talk,

20:09.480 --> 20:11.517
but this new gang
is trouble.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.752
What can you tell
us about 'em?

20:14.320 --> 20:16.152
They're makin' fake money.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.958
<i>Counterfeiters.</i>

20:17.960 --> 20:20.429
No, not counting money,

20:20.960 --> 20:23.475
they're making fake cash
and passing it off as real.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.676
That's what
counterfeiting is, girlie.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.230
Darlin', do you know
any of these counter--

20:29.240 --> 20:32.438
These men that are making
the money?

20:33.040 --> 20:35.509
Did you hear your dad
say any names?

20:38.200 --> 20:41.557
Listen up now,
you tell us their names

20:41.560 --> 20:43.711
or we'll send you to
the sisters of perpetual sorrow

20:43.720 --> 20:44.915
and they'll lock
you up for life.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.435
I swear,
I don't know their names!

20:47.760 --> 20:48.876
I only know
they're workin'

20:48.880 --> 20:50.837
out of some dive
in the neighborhood.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.793
Christ.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.395
They are more dives
in Five Points

20:54.400 --> 20:56.676
than fleas on a corkman.

21:00.800 --> 21:01.790
Good day.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.032
First, my
condolences, gentlemen.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.394
There's nothing harder
for a copper

21:13.400 --> 21:16.199
than losing one of their own
in the line of duty.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.317
We have buried far too many
heroes in this war.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.754
Amen to that.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.594
On the way here I noticed all
the drinking and gaming spots

21:22.600 --> 21:24.637
are still operating
full throttle, Captain.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.438
Well, sure, uh...

21:26.440 --> 21:29.239
<i>This neighborhood is
fueled on secrets and lies.</i>

21:29.240 --> 21:31.914
<i>Somebody out there
killed officer Byrnes;</i>

21:31.920 --> 21:33.798
others know who
that cretin is.

21:33.800 --> 21:34.916
Well,
logically speaking--

21:34.920 --> 21:37.799
shut every saloon,
every rum den,

21:37.800 --> 21:40.235
every gaming joint,
every whore house,

21:40.240 --> 21:43.438
then post a two hundred dollar
reward for the killer.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.750
Sir, those establishments
all pay us for protection.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.275
You make people bleed money!

21:49.440 --> 21:51.033
It's the only way
to force Five Points

21:51.040 --> 21:53.111
into giving up her secrets.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.759
Keating says these new plates,

22:02.760 --> 22:07.039
even the banker Chase won't
be able to spot the fakes.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.793
What's wrong with
the ones we've been usin'?

22:08.800 --> 22:11.838
Eh, certain
imperfections are becoming known

22:11.880 --> 22:13.633
to the banks
and their agents.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.757
It's all cat and mouse,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.798
but Keating will do anythin'
to protect this batch.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.713
The finest detail ever seen.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.356
No one's gonna be able
to tell the difference.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.192
Seems like a pretty
keen fellow this Keating,

22:26.200 --> 22:27.520
a real brainly.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.600
Matthew,
you are a smart man,

22:30.600 --> 22:33.752
you must realize that this trip
is impossible for you.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.200
I made the trip
out of the South before,

22:35.200 --> 22:36.190
I can do so again.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.554
- No! What if I lose you...
- I'll ride down to Virginia

22:37.560 --> 22:39.119
and locate your mother

22:39.120 --> 22:40.190
and bring her to New York
using contacts

22:40.200 --> 22:41.270
from the old
underground railroad.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.396
I don't wanna be alone.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.952
Now it's enough to know
that she is still alive.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.993
Matthew, truly,
it's enough.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.992
You know it's not.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.151
We'll discuss this later

22:56.280 --> 22:58.920
when we've had time
to think it over.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.991
Only a jackass would think
he could make that trip safely!

23:06.520 --> 23:10.400
<i>The day after your nuptials
and yet you stand before me.</i>

23:10.400 --> 23:13.552
<i>I can only take that
to portend one thing:</i>

23:13.560 --> 23:16.712
<i>you successfully inveigled
your husband not to testify.</i>

23:16.720 --> 23:18.234
<i>Oh, my lord,</i>

23:18.240 --> 23:20.630
I'm gonna be a free man!

23:20.640 --> 23:22.552
To go home,
have a clean shirt,

23:22.560 --> 23:25.075
a bath,
a slice of chess pie;

23:25.640 --> 23:27.438
<i>I salivate at the thought.</i>

23:27.440 --> 23:29.591
<i>And then afterwards...</i>

23:29.600 --> 23:32.240
<i>Uh, something else
I desire to taste.</i>

23:36.120 --> 23:38.555
No, sir,
you are wrong.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.600
You will not see home,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.398
you will not taste
southern cuisine,

23:44.400 --> 23:46.915
and you certainly
will not touch me.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.357
Oh, now's not the time
to be stupid.

23:51.040 --> 23:55.114
<i>You ridiculous,
self-absorbed man.</i>

23:55.120 --> 23:57.589
The world is cracked
in two;

23:59.040 --> 24:02.397
I refuse to continue
to be part of this...

24:02.720 --> 24:04.916
Game of deception.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.920
<i>I will not involve my husband
in my mistakes</i>

24:07.920 --> 24:10.913
and you will not become
free of this jail.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.352
You and I will not see
one another again.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.589
<i>I'll send word
to Mr. Robert Morehouse</i>

24:16.880 --> 24:17.791
<i>of your involvement.</i>

24:17.800 --> 24:19.792
I have already informed
my husband.

24:21.240 --> 24:23.630
You were foolish once,
don't be again.

24:23.640 --> 24:26.235
<i>I will confess of your
involvement in the plot.</i>

24:26.240 --> 24:27.515
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

24:30.280 --> 24:33.398
Detective Corcoran
of the Metropolitan Police!

24:35.840 --> 24:38.912
This shithole is officially
being closed by the city!

24:38.920 --> 24:42.311
Hey, we pay every
Tuesday, Copper.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.789
<i>Yeah, well, apparently not enough.</i>

24:44.800 --> 24:46.314
That means
move it! Get out!

24:48.200 --> 24:49.600
Go on!

24:50.600 --> 24:52.000
We're going!

24:56.240 --> 24:59.438
Having a wee party
out there, are ya, Corky?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.716
Get up and get out... now.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.152
Me and you had
many a jar in places like this

25:12.160 --> 25:13.799
over the years,

25:14.280 --> 25:15.873
Kevin Patrick Corcoran.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.872
Well, I'm done with you.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.234
Irish dead am I?

25:20.640 --> 25:22.632
You've got nothin' on me.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.711
I went before a judge
and was freed

25:25.720 --> 25:27.791
by the state of New York.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.230
- Exonerated I was.
- Not by me, you weren't.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.392
Detective, I only stepped
out for a second,

25:46.400 --> 25:47.675
I swear,
and the girl, Annie,

25:47.680 --> 25:49.990
she sneaked out
of the precinct.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.480
Officer Kelly said
she jumped in a carriage,

25:51.480 --> 25:53.551
headed uptown.

25:53.560 --> 25:55.392
I'll be back before
you close the next dive down.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.471
I'm only gonna lie
to the bosses...

25:57.480 --> 25:59.995
...so many times for you,
Kevin.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.071
That's it, lads, anywhere!

26:09.200 --> 26:10.919
What's this?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.190
Should I expect a
flotilla of pirate ships?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.112
My dear
Miss Heissen, haven't you heard?

26:21.120 --> 26:23.237
There's a hunt on
for a cop killer.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.596
The Metropolitan Police are
closing down your competition,

26:25.600 --> 26:28.991
hoping to jog someone's memory
or conscience.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.631
And you're letting
me stay open?

26:32.640 --> 26:34.472
Who likes to drink at home?

26:34.680 --> 26:37.878
Huh. In exchange for what?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.031
Information.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.272
General Donovan,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.670
a whore is like a lawyer
or priest,

26:46.680 --> 26:49.070
we betray
no confidences.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.039
This is about
Detective Corcoran.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.997
Why is he so obsessed
with a young girl

26:54.000 --> 26:56.151
named Annie Reilly?

26:56.160 --> 26:59.073
Something untoward about him
I should know?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.349
Of all the men I know,

27:02.360 --> 27:05.831
Kevin is the least likely
to have such tastes.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.839
What he does have
is a righteous streak,

27:09.840 --> 27:13.436
trying to save her soul,
maybe his own.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.358
Righteousness can be
a very useful thing...

27:17.920 --> 27:19.434
Or not.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.316
When the dust clears
on this cop killing

27:25.320 --> 27:28.757
several of the places shut up
will not be allowed to re-open,

27:28.760 --> 27:32.993
and my guess is that
the business will migrate here.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.074
Many high-stakes games,
big money from uptown.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.832
To what do I owe
such kindness?

27:41.840 --> 27:46.232
Let's just say you and I make
great business partners.

27:46.240 --> 27:50.120
The world is our oyster,
my dearest Eva.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.359
<i>Take care.</i>

28:07.400 --> 28:08.914
<i>Papers!</i>

28:12.280 --> 28:13.555
Kevin...

28:13.560 --> 28:16.632
I'm just here
to talk, got a few questions.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.312
Has Annie been around?

28:21.520 --> 28:24.399
Are you serious?

28:24.400 --> 28:26.392
You travel all this way
to ask after the very girl

28:26.400 --> 28:28.073
you threatened my life over?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.799
I have no interest
in any interactions

28:29.800 --> 28:30.950
with that character.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.997
I heard the two of you
got along famously

28:33.000 --> 28:34.354
at your wedding.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.556
One makes appearances
when necessary.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.155
Besides she has no power
to ruin my special day.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.196
Special?

28:40.200 --> 28:43.557
While your husband spends
your honeymoon in a brothel.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.597
Perhaps he was distraught
that his so-called best man

28:45.600 --> 28:48.593
couldn't be bothered
to show for his wedding.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.513
What now, Kevin?

28:50.520 --> 28:52.830
Will you hold a knife
to my throat?

28:52.840 --> 28:56.629
Or have you devised a new,
more brutish affectation?

28:59.480 --> 29:02.314
Send word
if Annie shows up.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.914
How long will
You follow her path

29:05.920 --> 29:08.196
before you realize
you've lost her?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.800
I may not be able
to save Annie Reilly,

29:10.800 --> 29:14.760
but I won't let you ruin
Robert Morehouse as well.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.999
If you see my husband,
please tell him

29:20.000 --> 29:22.993
his supper will be waiting
promptly at five o'clock.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.839
<i>Let me tell you,
this damn world</i>

30:13.840 --> 30:16.230
<i>is a bigger ball of wax
then you'll ever know.</i>

30:17.720 --> 30:21.555
Do yourself a favor, Jake,
don't deny it,

30:23.240 --> 30:25.038
embrace the itch.

30:27.840 --> 30:32.437
Embrace it, Jake.
Embrace the itch.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.870
I'll be needing to
pack for travel to Virginia...

31:05.880 --> 31:07.792
...as soon as possible.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.029
Please prepare
my steamer trunk

31:09.040 --> 31:10.952
and have Adam secure me
a ticket.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.873
Right away, Mrs. Morehouse.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.956
Tell him
what you told me.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.429
The killer
is Francis Maguire.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.194
I heard him admit
the murder me self.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.914
Arg!

31:45.920 --> 31:47.957
I swear!
He stabbed the boy!

31:48.960 --> 31:50.997
Ungh!

31:51.000 --> 31:52.229
He's part of
a counterfeitin' ring!

31:52.240 --> 31:54.755
You heard him say
it or you saw him do it?

31:54.760 --> 31:56.160
Detective!

31:57.160 --> 31:58.833
Arg!

32:04.600 --> 32:07.479
Take some boys
and pick Maguire up.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.437
Don't let anyone know why.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.318
Tell him we have back pay
for him or something;

32:11.320 --> 32:13.312
I don't want him
running off.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.837
You believe this sack
of shite? Maguire was one of us!

32:18.200 --> 32:20.192
So was Phinbar Byrnes!

32:26.760 --> 32:29.912
<i>I felt it necessary
to thank you in person.</i>

32:29.920 --> 32:32.071
An act, a gift this grand,

32:33.200 --> 32:34.998
I'm unsure how we can express
our gratitude

32:35.000 --> 32:36.798
<i>for what you've done.</i>

32:37.320 --> 32:38.720
<i>Sara, Matthew,</i>

32:38.720 --> 32:40.598
I appreciate you coming
uptown to give thanks,

32:40.600 --> 32:42.159
but your trip
was unnecessary.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.117
Nevertheless,
we will find some way

32:44.120 --> 32:45.918
to repay you
for this miracle

32:45.920 --> 32:48.037
that you've bestowed
upon us,

32:48.040 --> 32:49.759
perhaps when I return.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.194
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

32:51.200 --> 32:52.554
Tomorrow morn,
I'm headed to Virginia

32:52.560 --> 32:55.280
to bring Sara's mother
to New York.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.636
Excuse my candid speech,
Doctor Freeman,

32:58.640 --> 33:01.633
but I thought you were
an educated man?

33:02.200 --> 33:04.032
A negro trying to break
into the South

33:04.040 --> 33:07.078
in the middle of this war
is madness.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.433
And I take no offence,
Mrs. Morehouse,

33:11.440 --> 33:13.397
but I vowed that I'd bring
my wife's mother home

33:13.400 --> 33:15.198
and that is what
I intend to do.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.873
No, you will not.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.280
I have booked my passage
to Virginia,

33:20.280 --> 33:21.760
I will personally
go to the plantation

33:21.760 --> 33:23.353
<i>and shepherd Sara's mother
to your door.</i>

33:23.360 --> 33:24.794
Mrs. Morehouse,
that would be so--

33:24.800 --> 33:26.951
<i>Not needed.</i>

33:31.960 --> 33:34.680
Caucasian or negro,
you men seem willing

33:34.680 --> 33:36.751
to risk anything,

33:36.760 --> 33:38.717
be it your marriages
or your lives,

33:38.720 --> 33:41.633
rather than suffer a bruise
to your pride.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.397
No.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.751
No, my word is final.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.834
I will travel south;

33:47.840 --> 33:50.594
you will stay in New York
and treat your patients.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.956
You see?
I'm already packed to go.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.555
Family is all we have,
Matthew.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.795
Do not risk
destroying yours.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.352
And please know,

34:05.360 --> 34:08.831
this journey is something
I must do,

34:08.840 --> 34:11.116
as much for myself
as for you and Sara.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.840
Deliver the plates
to Keating as discussed.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.320
No stopping whatsoever.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.594
Aye.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.478
'Til tomorrow.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.993
Francis.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.592
Did you do it?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.674
Please tell me that
you didn't, Francis.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.279
We have the forger's plates!

35:08.280 --> 35:10.397
<i>Tell me...</i>

35:10.400 --> 35:12.551
...You didn't kill Phinbar.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.560
You going someplace?

35:29.560 --> 35:31.631
Some contracting business.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.553
Make sure this gets
to Miss Heissen.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.155
Off to examine a marble quarry
in Tuckahoe,

35:37.160 --> 35:38.913
off all god-forsaken places.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.560
Captain said
you wanted to see me?

35:44.240 --> 35:46.152
Let me be straight, Kevin.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.871
As a young man I learned,

35:48.880 --> 35:50.234
to become a powerful leader,

35:50.240 --> 35:52.596
one must maintain
the institutions

35:52.600 --> 35:54.000
to which people
are accustomed.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.640
Something goes wrong,
someone gets out of hand,

35:56.640 --> 35:59.200
you deal with the problem
immediately.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.079
But sometimes,
when a thing is broke,

36:02.080 --> 36:03.912
not fixing it is best.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.071
Some things only
get more broke...

36:07.080 --> 36:08.958
...when you try to fix them.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.714
I thought you said
you were gonna be straight?

36:14.080 --> 36:16.072
Men in power cannot afford

36:16.080 --> 36:19.437
to let a single incident
become a crusade.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.796
Emotions overwhelm
intellect

36:21.800 --> 36:24.156
and then, well, chaos.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.114
I need men around me

36:27.120 --> 36:29.589
who are focused
on the greater good.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.995
Can I trust you to be
one of those men?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.510
You can.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.592
I thought as much.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.115
I appreciate you
coming down here

36:42.120 --> 36:43.793
and having this chat.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.836
All right,
off to Tuckahoe.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.871
The desk sergeant
said I'd find you here.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.839
On the third day
Jesus rose from the dead.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.911
I do believe
I have drunk myself sober;

37:01.920 --> 37:03.718
a rare feat.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.837
What happened last night?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.593
You don't remember?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.239
You were barely coherent.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.039
I made something out about
Elizabeth and Kennedy?

37:12.640 --> 37:14.393
Petty jealousy.

37:14.760 --> 37:18.436
She commented in passing
that Kennedy was handsome,

37:18.440 --> 37:20.875
I was envious and drunk.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.554
It snowballed into
a fool's argument.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.359
I've never known you
to be the envious type.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.874
You've never known
me married.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.230
Can I trust that
what happened

37:30.240 --> 37:32.072
will remain private?

37:33.080 --> 37:34.400
Of course.

37:35.760 --> 37:39.515
I must go back
and practice my groveling.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.989
This married business
is hard labor.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.672
Has he left?
Mister Donovan?

37:49.800 --> 37:50.517
Yup.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.512
They've arrested
the cop killer.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.397
Who?

37:53.440 --> 37:54.157
Oh, I don't know
the name,

37:54.160 --> 37:57.039
just that they're
bringing him in, now.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.675
Corky.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.312
Enough.

38:30.880 --> 38:31.870
Get him a doctor.

38:31.880 --> 38:32.870
But detective--

38:32.880 --> 38:34.075
Now!

38:56.960 --> 38:59.475
Francis killed a copper.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.639
I looked at him
in his cell,

39:05.640 --> 39:07.791
beaten and bloodied,
guilty,

39:07.800 --> 39:10.793
and all I thought of
was you...

39:12.880 --> 39:15.236
...you and him.

39:18.880 --> 39:22.078
I can't do this anymore,

39:22.600 --> 39:24.557
whatever this is.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.793
I've tried but I...

39:26.800 --> 39:29.269
I can't get past
what happened.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.749
You and Maguire...

39:32.320 --> 39:33.356
...Maggie.

39:36.920 --> 39:40.311
All I wanted was for things
to be the way they were before,

39:40.400 --> 39:41.550
but...

39:43.440 --> 39:46.000
It ain't never gonna
happen that way.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.354
You'll be taken care of,
I'll see to that,

39:52.360 --> 39:54.317
but I need to go.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.354
That's what you said
when you left us

39:58.360 --> 40:00.079
the first time.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.034
You are dismissed,
Corporal.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.434
Elizabeth? Elizabeth?

40:33.400 --> 40:34.390
Have you seen
Mrs. Morehouse?

40:34.400 --> 40:35.880
She left an hour ago,
sir.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.440
- What? For where?
- Why Virginia, sir?

40:39.440 --> 40:41.113
I'll draw you a bath,
sir.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.879
There you go!

40:47.320 --> 40:48.834
Careful.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.596
You look like
you need this.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.993
I've got a new girl.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.830
I could use some
expert appraisal.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.038
What's her name?

41:13.400 --> 41:14.436
Lola.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.316
She's practically a virgin.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.680
Lola!

41:30.120 --> 41:32.680
This is Detective
Kevin Corcoran.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.839
He's a friend of mine.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.159
I'll be sure
to treat him as one.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.119
<i>I'm telling you,
Mr. Keating,</i>

41:52.120 --> 41:53.793
<i>Maguire can't be trusted.</i>

41:53.800 --> 41:55.837
We should slip
someone in there

41:55.840 --> 41:59.072
and kill him before he blows
the whole operation wide open.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.589
Maybe like?

42:00.600 --> 42:02.114
<i>I think our Mr. Maguire</i>

42:02.120 --> 42:06.433
is made of stronger stuff.
Am I right, Mr. O'Rourke?

42:06.440 --> 42:08.909
I heard he took
a real whuppin'

42:08.920 --> 42:10.957
and we're still
here standin',

42:10.960 --> 42:13.111
<i>not a copper in sight.</i>

42:13.120 --> 42:14.440
And?

42:17.440 --> 42:19.875
Where are my plates,
O'Rourke?

42:21.440 --> 42:24.239
Them bastard cops
grabbed them,

42:24.240 --> 42:26.835
<i>along with our man Maguire.</i>

42:27.240 --> 42:29.835
Then we shall do
what must be done!

42:30.960 --> 42:32.679
First thing, sunrise,
we storm the precinct

42:32.680 --> 42:34.717
and get back what's mine!
