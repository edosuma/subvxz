<i>You're watching</i> The Grinder.

<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.486 --> 00:20.352
Right this way. Thank you.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.290
Ah, damn it.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.625
Uh, b-busboy?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.494
Uh, the mess...

00:28.496 --> 00:29.995
Do you have a rag or something?

00:29.997 --> 00:31.463
(Spanish accent): <i>Sí,</i> I clean.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.332
SPECIAL AGENT: <i>You'll disappear.</i>

00:33.334 --> 00:35.000
Lodgepole, Nebraska.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.301
Your new identity...

00:36.303 --> 00:38.137
Guillermo Rojas Morajas.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.339
Where's he from?
Born in Guadalupe, Mexico.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.573
Migrated to the States

00:41.575 --> 00:43.409
with his family, age 11.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.077
I'll let you fill in the rest.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.079
<i>600 grand will be placed</i>

00:47.081 --> 00:49.081
<i>in a safe deposit box.</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:51.250
<i>You'll work at Starvey's Diner,
Sixth and Edsel.</i>

00:51.252 --> 00:53.185
<i>Keep your head down</i>

00:53.187 --> 00:54.186
and a low profile.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.354
The world needs to believe

00:55.356 --> 00:56.355
that Mitch Grinder is dead.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.589
What about my family?

00:57.591 --> 00:59.591
<i>Your friends and loved ones...</i>

01:00.694 --> 01:02.161
you can never see them again.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.329
Dang it, I don't have
another pair for court.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.265
We're gonna have to stop
by my condo on the way there.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.933
We don't have time, Tom.
We have to file the motion

01:07.935 --> 01:10.169
for the change of venue by 3:00.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.603
Heather, who are we kidding?

01:11.605 --> 01:13.172
Judge Mathison is going
to deny the request anyway.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.107
We're screwed.
Perhaps you will file a motion

01:15.109 --> 01:18.277
for reconsideration based
on equitable principals.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.578
If your client is innocent,

01:19.580 --> 01:22.714
the "yudge"...
will have to move it.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.617
'Cause after all, equity...

01:25.619 --> 01:27.719
BOTH: Abhors a vacuum.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.054
Wait.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.456
That could actually work.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.759
Hey, kid...

01:35.062 --> 01:36.595
Who the hell are you?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.030
I am just a busboy.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.168
I am nobody.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.939
Dean?

01:46.941 --> 01:49.074
Are you watching...? What? No.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.242
You are, ah.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.477
We talked about this.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.945
The whole point of therapy

01:52.947 --> 01:54.947
was to move on from this.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.815
You're right, I'm sorry.
I thought you burned everything.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.317
I did, I...

01:58.319 --> 01:59.985
but there was an overlooked

01:59.987 --> 02:02.254
DVD in the player, and I just...

02:02.256 --> 02:03.589
I was just gonna watch it once,

02:03.591 --> 02:05.057
and then I was gonna burn it.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.059
I swear. Do you want to
set back your recovery?

02:07.061 --> 02:08.594
Is that what you want? No.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.516
Then you know what
you need to do.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.607
Die, Grinder... die!

02:21.609 --> 02:22.889
Grinder...

02:26.113 --> 02:28.113
You know you could have just...

02:28.115 --> 02:31.116
destroyed the DVD itself,
not the whole...

02:31.118 --> 02:32.918
It's a process.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.919
I'm still learning.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.120
I know.

02:35.122 --> 02:38.524
¶ ¶

02:39.693 --> 02:41.093
So he's dating her now, right?

02:41.095 --> 02:42.294
He's-he's dating my therapist.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.996
Isn't she technically
<i>his</i> therapist?

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
Uh, yes, she is, Ethan.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.965
Thank you, uh,
for pointing that out.

02:46.967 --> 02:47.966
You know, honey,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.301
I trusted this woman.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.602
You know, we worked through

02:50.604 --> 02:52.437
some very complicated
issues together.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.439
And you're absolutely sure
that you saw them kissing?

02:54.441 --> 02:56.108
They did it right
in front of me, I'm positive.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.476
They didn't even try
and hide it.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.211
It was like they were...
They were flaunting it.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.812
Uh-huh. It's got to
violate some oath, right?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.381
There's an oath that
she must have taken

03:02.383 --> 03:04.049
that thi-this is against.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.817
I don't know, but ethically,
it's in a gray zone.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.052
Oh, okay, there
are no gray zones

03:07.054 --> 03:08.720
when it comes to love, Ethan.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.455
Yeah, Ethan. So I'm on the
wrong side of this, then?

03:10.457 --> 03:13.458
It's perfectly fine to have
a romantic relationship

03:13.460 --> 03:15.127
with your therapist?
I heard that.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.628
Someone's feathers are ruffled.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.630
Uh, yes, Dean,
they-they are a little bit.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.199
(yawns) For good reason.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.466
It is your house.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.701
I should have gotten permission

03:22.703 --> 03:24.736
before I invited
an overnight guest.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.339
Wait, you brought Jillian here,
to our house? To spend the night?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.141
Yes, she's here now.
What would you have me do,

03:29.143 --> 03:30.876
get her a cab
the minute we're done?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.811
It's Jillian, not some skank.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.146
That's not the reason, Dean.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.414
Dad thinks Jillian can't remain

03:35.416 --> 03:36.982
neutral if you guys are dating.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.917
Yes, Ethan, that...
that's a big part of it.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.986
Well, Stew, I have to say,
I'm a little insulted.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.821
Oh, you're insulted.
Jillian's a professional.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.423
Starting to question that.
She can separate.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.325
You know, you don't think
that they taught her

03:46.327 --> 03:47.759
at therapy school that,
if you're gonna date

03:47.761 --> 03:50.028
a patient,
you got to separate stuff?

03:50.030 --> 03:51.863
I do not think they taught her that.
I feel like that's not a class...

03:51.865 --> 03:53.065
No... In therapy school.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.499
And-and how does
this really work?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.702
I mean, do the lines never get blurred?
No, never.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.403
When we're in session,
she's my therapist.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.172
When we're not in session,
she's my girlfriend.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.440
Right.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.041
What if you wanted

04:03.043 --> 04:04.409
to talk to your therapist
about your girlfriend?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.277
Then I do.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.545
And I have.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.347
And it's helpful.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.415
JILLIAN: Dean, can you
bring me some coffee?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.950
Sure, hon!

04:11.952 --> 04:14.586
That's my girlfriend.
And I want to finish

04:14.588 --> 04:16.021
what we were talking about.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.089
Therapist.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.290
Deb gets it.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.193
STEWART: <i>I was gonna talk</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:22.361
to you about this at the house,

04:22.363 --> 04:23.895
but, um, that felt...

04:23.897 --> 04:25.097
uh, inappropriate.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.098
Yeah. (Chuckles)

04:26.100 --> 04:27.766
It would have been.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.035
Right,<i> that</i> would've been...
inappropriate.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.703
But let's say you did
talk to me at the house.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.938
What would you have said?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.373
Well, I would have
said something

04:34.375 --> 04:37.075
like, "What the hell
are you doing, Jillian?"

04:37.077 --> 04:38.277
This was not the plan."

04:38.279 --> 04:39.711
And what plan was that, Stewart?

04:39.713 --> 04:40.879
Uh, the one where you talk
some sense into my brother,

04:40.881 --> 04:42.281
bring him back down to earth

04:42.283 --> 04:43.949
for a little bit,
and not sleep with him.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.117
That-that plan. Okay.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.118
For me to collude

04:46.120 --> 04:47.252
with one patient against another

04:47.254 --> 04:48.387
would be highly unethical.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.621
That would be unethical?!

04:49.623 --> 04:50.822
That would be unethical?

04:50.824 --> 04:52.257
You know what, Jillian,

04:52.259 --> 04:53.925
I feel like we're done, we're...

04:53.927 --> 04:55.427
We've come to the end
of our-our road.

04:55.429 --> 04:58.330
You seem angry.
Well, yeah, I am angry.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.265
And don't we always say
that making big decisions

05:00.267 --> 05:02.434
when you're angry is a bad idea?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.603
We do say that, Jillian, but...
But what?

05:04.605 --> 05:05.937
But t-this is...

05:05.939 --> 05:07.072
different.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.273
Now we're getting somewhere.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.343
In what way is this different?

05:11.345 --> 05:12.611
I don't know.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.279
I... i-it's...

05:14.281 --> 05:15.947
It's complicated. Mm-hmm.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.649
Do you think this is maybe

05:17.651 --> 05:20.452
less about your
brother and I dating,

05:20.454 --> 05:24.122
and more about your
inferiority issues with him?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.457
No, I wouldn't...

05:25.459 --> 05:27.192
I wouldn't call it that, no.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.794
Well, don't you think we should
know what we'd call it?

05:28.796 --> 05:29.795
Yeah.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.029
Yeah, I-I guess...

05:31.031 --> 05:32.431
I guess we should know that.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.799
Great.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.434
Let's start with
your recurring dream

05:35.436 --> 05:37.769
where Dean carries you around
in his suit pocket.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.491
(whispering): All right.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.175
STEWART: <i>So,</i>

05:43.177 --> 05:44.643
I went through Dad's case,

05:44.645 --> 05:46.111
and for someone claiming
to represent himself,

05:46.113 --> 05:47.779
this-this Cory Manler

05:47.781 --> 05:48.947
is really prepared. I think

05:48.949 --> 05:50.449
he's secretly working
with a lawyer.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.451
If he had counsel,
why would he be hiding it?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.686
I don't know, but I think we
should ask for a continuance.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.987
Stew, what did I say?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.789
I'm handling this.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.624
Besides, you're paranoid.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.026
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with this guy's ass.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.027
Okay, I have

06:02.029 --> 06:04.363
a vanilla latte for... Todd?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.630
Ooh, that's me.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.032
Dean, what are you doing?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.133
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.301
I was just on a coffee run.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.369
And why are you doing that?

06:10.371 --> 06:11.670
Well, now that I've cleansed

06:11.672 --> 06:13.138
myself of all things<i> Grinder</i>

06:13.140 --> 06:15.073
and all things dramatic,
I am a blank slate.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.074
So, I've been working with

06:16.076 --> 06:17.542
my therapist to build myself

06:17.544 --> 06:20.145
back up from ground zero.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.980
Well, Dean, we are here for you,

06:21.982 --> 06:22.981
we believe in you,

06:22.983 --> 06:24.249
and we love you.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.585
And I love the law.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.853
But I've realized

06:27.855 --> 06:30.922
that I am not a lawyer.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.158
What? Say that again.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.726
I...

06:34.728 --> 06:36.194
am not...

06:36.196 --> 06:37.362
a lawyer.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.363
I mean, sure,

06:38.365 --> 06:40.365
I'm great at playing one, but...

06:40.367 --> 06:41.867
I don't know diddly
about being one.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.435
Nonsense,
you're as much a lawyer

06:43.437 --> 06:45.036
as anybody in this room.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.338
Well, Dad...

06:46.340 --> 06:47.572
Thanks, Dad,
but that's just not true...

06:47.574 --> 06:48.840
and I know that now.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.075
I need to start
on the ground floor.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.910
Which is why, from now on,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.346
I'm going to be an intern
at Sanderson & Yao.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.414
You know, I mean,

06:55.416 --> 06:56.915
I'm done with shortcuts,
you know?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.350
I want to do things
the right way.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.051
Well, Dean, this sounds great.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.920
You're still gonna give us
speeches and stuff, right?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.522
And inspire us?

07:03.524 --> 07:05.123
Well, I'll do whatever
I can to help the firm,

07:05.125 --> 07:07.359
but within the capacity
of my own skill set.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.361
Which is...
So, if you'll excuse me...

07:11.265 --> 07:12.697
I am going to empty this trash

07:12.699 --> 07:14.232
and get it out
of your guys' hair

07:14.234 --> 07:15.767
because that is my job

07:15.769 --> 07:17.702
and I intend to do it.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.242
Did that just happen?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.243
(all murmuring) I'm not sure.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.045
Please tell me that was real.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.948
Deb! Hey!

07:29.950 --> 07:31.616
Oh, that's right,
you're helping Dad.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.485
'Cause he'll accept it from you
and not his lawyer son.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.954
Uh, how's that going?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.322
Um, well, it's a lot of work,
actually,

07:37.324 --> 07:39.224
because your filing system
is terrible.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.625
Maybe you just don't know
how it works.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.927
Oh, I'm sorry, does it work
in some way?

07:41.929 --> 07:43.261
Really well. Enlighten me.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.263
Name any file, I'll have
it in front of you in 20.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.098
20 minutes, and you're proud of that?
That's good!

07:47.100 --> 07:48.800
Come on, just let me help,
I'm here.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.935
Let her help.

07:49.937 --> 07:50.936
It's free.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.337
Yeah, it's free.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.833
For now. We'll talk about that.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.447
Uh-uh.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.583
Back there. I'm driving.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.452
Dad, this is silly. We don't
know what we're up against here.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.954
We shouldn't underestimate
this guy.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.522
Please.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.658
This is a gimme.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.762
Sorry I'm late.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.431
The copy machine
ran out of toner.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.366
Ah, you're working too hard.
Take a load off.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.034
The fun's about to begin.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.302
Oh, he gets to sit at the table?

08:24.304 --> 08:25.303
I thought he was an intern.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.605
I am an intern,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.440
but your father
forgot his briefcase.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.975
You forgot your briefcase?
You're a mess, Dad.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.843
(chuckles) Thank God
we got a great intern.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.811
STEWART: Yeah. He
brought it right over.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.212
Thank God for the intern.

08:34.214 --> 08:37.048
Okay, let's get started.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.950
Prelim hearing,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.285
<i>Manler v. Sanderson.</i>

08:40.287 --> 08:41.620
We'll hear from
the defendant first,

08:41.622 --> 08:42.621
Mr. Sanderson?

08:42.623 --> 08:43.722
Your Honor, these claims

08:43.724 --> 08:45.323
against me are baseless.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.725
The only thing
that really matters

08:46.727 --> 08:48.226
is the statute of limitations.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.861
It expired two years ago.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.696
And we move for dismissal

08:51.698 --> 08:53.565
and suggest that the plaintiff

08:53.567 --> 08:56.368
apologize to the court
for wasting its time.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.702
Mr. Manler, how do you respond?

08:57.704 --> 08:59.738
All right, here we go.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.140
This ought to be good.
All right, Your Honor,

09:02.142 --> 09:03.308
the statute of limitations

09:03.310 --> 09:05.510
is tolled due to the precedent

09:05.512 --> 09:07.812
of<i> Howerton v. Skarbek,</i>

09:07.814 --> 09:09.548
which stands for the proposition

09:09.550 --> 09:10.682
that the statute of limitations

09:10.684 --> 09:12.851
on legal malpractice is tolled

09:12.853 --> 09:14.486
if the client had
no reasonable basis

09:14.488 --> 09:17.756
upon which to suspect
that malpractice

09:17.758 --> 09:19.257
had occurred.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.195
What does "tolled" mean?

09:24.197 --> 09:25.463
It means we're screwed.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.103
Did you see that?
Did you<i> see</i> that?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.605
Manler is a puppet.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.873
Someone's pulling the strings.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.575
So, I screwed the pooch,
all right?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.543
Your old man screwed the pooch.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.444
Is that what you want to hear?

09:39.446 --> 09:40.378
Dad, let me help you.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.713
(Dean Sr. Grunts angrily)

09:41.715 --> 09:42.914
So, are you saying

09:42.916 --> 09:45.016
that this is some sort
of conspiracy theory?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.885
I don't think it is.
Really, Todd?

09:46.887 --> 09:49.087
You jump on literally every
idea. There's nothing here?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.523
Yeah, I'm just not feeling it.
Right, Dean?

09:51.525 --> 09:52.891
Oh, oh, I don't know.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.226
It's not really my area
of expertise.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.861
Ooh, these guys are thirsty.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.396
Conspiracy did nothing for you?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.864
Well, it's above my pay grade,

09:59.866 --> 10:01.933
but did you ever consider
maybe he has a friend

10:01.935 --> 10:03.435
who's giving him
free legal advice?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.436
(chuckling): Yeah.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.437
I get free legal advice

10:05.439 --> 10:06.605
from my friends all the time.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.872
Uh, I mean...

10:07.874 --> 10:10.442
I... did... before
I became a lawyer.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.610
But now, no. I don't know.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.044
Something's off here.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.279
You know, I feel it in my gut.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.280
DEAN:
The law's not about your gut.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.882
It's about the facts.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.117
I learned that the hard way.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.285
When? How?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.721
The only<i> fact</i> we have
is that the guy

10:22.723 --> 10:24.656
was incredibly well prepared.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.924
To draw any conclusions

10:25.926 --> 10:28.727
beyond that feels like a leap.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.962
Now, that's the level-headed
Deano I know.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.431
Really? No one thinks
that it's possible

10:33.433 --> 10:34.666
that something else is going on?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.134
Oh, something else<i> is</i> going on,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.836
and Jillian warned me
that it might happen.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.004
Now that I'm on the
road to recovery,

10:39.006 --> 10:40.772
I've left a void

10:40.774 --> 10:42.907
on the dramatic mantle
of your life.

10:42.909 --> 10:43.908
That's what's happening.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.443
No, that is not
what's happening.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.444
And you're subconsciously

10:46.446 --> 10:48.747
attempting to fill that void.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.115
I mean, you are sounding
a little dramatic.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.950
What?! You might want
to work on this, Stew.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.585
Dig in like Dean's doing.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.586
STEWART: Like Dean?

10:54.588 --> 10:55.587
DEAN SR.: Yeah.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.555
All the plants are plastic.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.426
Look at us.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.428
Couple of interns
earning our keep.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.664
Hoping one day
we can be like them.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.632
Yeah, I'm not really an intern.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.933
We're gonna look back

11:08.935 --> 11:11.369
at our scrappy
file room days and think

11:11.371 --> 11:13.038
those were the best times
of our lives.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.039
God, I hope not.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.707
Oh, hon, hey.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.009
Hey, the kids are getting
dropped off here in a little.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.010
Oh, the kids are coming here?
Yeah.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.945
So he's just, he's just pulling,

11:20.947 --> 11:22.113
pulling everything
off the shelf then, huh?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.381
Yeah, listen, I-I need you
to drive them

11:23.383 --> 11:24.683
to Lizzie's basketball game
for me

11:24.685 --> 11:26.317
because I might have
to stay here late.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.719
Uh, wait, hon, what if
I have to stay here late?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.721
DEAN: You don't.
You're not handling

11:29.723 --> 11:31.122
Dad's case, right? Oh, he's
shredding, he's shredding,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.957
honey, he's...
W-what's he shredding?

11:32.959 --> 11:34.793
Why is he shredding papers? Oh,
my God, will you calm down?

11:34.795 --> 11:35.827
Everything is fine.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.562
Oops, Dean, wrong pile.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.897
You should absolutely
not be shredding those.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.565
Oh, I can't... I can't.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.067
DEAN: <i>Hey, Deb...</i>

11:42.069 --> 11:43.668
um, could I...
Could I get a squirt?

11:43.670 --> 11:44.969
I'm-I'm out.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.204
Yeah, sure,
it's in the bathroom.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.205
Where's Stew?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.339
Oh, he took the kids

11:48.341 --> 11:49.307
to Lizzie's basketball game.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.542
(sighs loudly)

11:51.845 --> 11:54.045
You're worried about
him, aren't you? Um...

11:54.047 --> 11:55.413
Yeah, me, too. Oh.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.581
Yeah, b-b-but

11:56.583 --> 11:57.982
we'll get through it because...

11:58.852 --> 12:01.586
we always do.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.823
What are we getting through?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.524
Sorry you lost
your game, Lizzie.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.559
Yeah, it's okay.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.760
The universe wanted me to have

12:08.762 --> 12:10.428
a character-building experience.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.711
And the universe didn't say
anything about quitting?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.867
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh, look at that, kids.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.902
That's Cory Manler.
That's Cory Manler.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.903
That's the guy

12:18.905 --> 12:20.271
who's suing Grandpa.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.439
Look at him! He's rolling
around, not a care in the world.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.841
ETHAN: Where are we going?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.683
STEWART: We're just gonna
make a little detour.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.780
He's clearly running from something.
He is?

12:28.782 --> 12:31.216
So, the only
question is... what?

12:31.218 --> 12:32.684
Huh. How are things in here?

12:32.686 --> 12:34.519
Oh, I don't want
to talk to you about that.

12:34.521 --> 12:35.587
Lacking. Didn't say that.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.689
Yeah, that's tough. All right.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.724
'Cause he's just not seeming like the
little Stew-bear we know and love.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.426
You know, all that talk about

12:41.428 --> 12:42.927
conspiracies... That's true,

12:42.929 --> 12:45.029
he has been acting
a little weird lately.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.564
No, a little weird is
you guys not having sex.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.900
Okay. This is alarmingly weird.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.735
Look, let's not
freak out about it.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.604
I mean, it's Stewart, right?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.606
He's not actually crazy.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.441
Lizzie, get down. Get down.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.276
LIZZIE: What are we doing?
STEWART: Shh!

12:58.278 --> 12:59.110
Oh, my gosh.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.211
I was right.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.946
He's working with someone.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.082
He... you see that,
kids, you see?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.284
You see, Dad is not wrong
all the time, okay?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.919
Uncle Dean's not the only person
who knows...

13:07.921 --> 13:09.120
How much longer
is this gonna take?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.121
Lizzie, this is important.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.389
What-what do you mean?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.591
I'm getting really tired.
Me, too.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.659
Guys...

13:14.661 --> 13:15.827
guys, come...

13:15.829 --> 13:16.995
(indistinct talking)

13:16.997 --> 13:18.229
Oh, he's handing him something.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.431
That's a... w-what is...
What is that?

13:20.433 --> 13:21.566
That's a small object, guys.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.767
That could be it.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.469
Hold on, I'm getting a picture.
(camera clicks)

13:24.471 --> 13:25.603
Let's see.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.939
ETHAN: Looks like a
flash drive maybe?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.607
STEWART: <i>Maybe</i> a flash drive?

13:29.609 --> 13:32.443
How about that is definitely
a flash drive, Ethan.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.611
So? So?!

13:33.613 --> 13:35.446
So now I have proof. Of what?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.015
Okay, you know what?
I am done with you guys.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.577
You know nothing about
what's going on here tonight.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.454
Hey, how's it going?

13:43.456 --> 13:44.589
Where have you been?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.624
I went to pick the kids up
at, uh, Lizzie's...

13:46.626 --> 13:47.792
Lizzie's basketball game.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.460
That was three hours
ago, Stewart.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.695
We took a drive. DEBBIE: Hmm.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.630
You know, it was a nice night.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.767
Then, Stewart, why did
Ethan text me this?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.268
STEWART (on video):
So, now I have proof.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.803
ETHAN (on video): Of what? What?

13:58.805 --> 13:59.971
You did that?

13:59.973 --> 14:00.972
You sent that?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.140
I sent it to Mom, too.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.274
You b-betrayed your father?

14:03.276 --> 14:04.943
Yeah, sorry, Dad, I...

14:04.945 --> 14:06.010
We had no choice.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.345
DEAN: Uh, Stewart, it's true.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.947
You left them no choice.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.669
Mm-hmm. (Stewart scoffs)

14:14.955 --> 14:16.554
Look, you guys are
totally overreacting.

14:16.556 --> 14:17.856
And why do you think that is?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.624
Jillian, thank you for-for

14:19.626 --> 14:20.692
coming on such short notice.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.861
That was definitely necessary.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.028
Stew, look at yourself.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.196
You're tailing people,

14:25.198 --> 14:26.397
you're kidnapping the kids...

14:26.399 --> 14:27.899
Okay, I did not kidnap the kids.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.201
Well, you did kind of
take them against their will.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.169
All right, would you
just look at this?

14:31.171 --> 14:32.170
Here, just...

14:32.172 --> 14:33.705
look at this.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.241
A flash drive exchange.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.209
In an alley?
In the middle of the night?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.577
That's not normal;
That's something.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.979
Stew, people exchange
flash drives

14:40.981 --> 14:41.980
at all hours.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.548
It's a 24-hour world.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.049
Business isn't just
9:00-to-5:00 anymore.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.718
May I say something?
No, Jillian.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.052
You may not. I-I don't feel like

14:48.054 --> 14:49.754
having a-a therapy session
right now.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.356
Oh, actually,
I'm not here as your therapist,

14:51.358 --> 14:53.191
I'm here as your
brother's lover.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.493
Right, which we're
all fine with.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.528
This is the behavior
that I was talking about.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.430
You guys have been talking about me?
Well, honey,

14:59.432 --> 15:01.499
Dean is just
concerned about you.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.568
This is ridiculous!
Guys, I'm fine!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.536
Stew, haven't you been
lashing out at Deb

15:05.538 --> 15:07.605
because she's trying to help
organize at the office?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.274
No! Yes, honey,
you kind of have.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.108
JILLIAN: We are all trying

15:10.110 --> 15:11.376
to help you, Stewart.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.077
How do you feel
when you hear that?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.679
Okay, that is therapist Jillian.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.614
There is no way
that is Jillian, the lover.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.050
And there's no way
that was you being fine.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.518
Come on, Stew.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.520
Talk to us. Please!

15:22.522 --> 15:24.122
We're here for you.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.457
We're not leaving until you do.
JILLIAN: Yeah, we are here for you.

15:26.459 --> 15:30.339
We're in for the long haul, honey.
100%. Not going anywhere.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.665
You know what, guys?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.201
I think you're right.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.237
There is something...

15:39.239 --> 15:41.105
going on with me.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.209
You've helped me to identify it,

15:45.211 --> 15:46.778
and that's...

15:46.780 --> 15:48.079
that's half the battle.

15:48.081 --> 15:48.947
It truly is.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.882
Did you hear that?

15:50.884 --> 15:53.217
That was a wall coming down.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.419
Is that what I heard?
Yeah, I heard it.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.386
I heard the wall.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.789
Stew... you know...

15:57.791 --> 15:59.090
everybody in this room

15:59.092 --> 16:00.558
just...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.827
just loves the heck out of you.
Mm...

16:02.829 --> 16:04.495
That's great. Great, thank you.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.897
I'm gonna work on this,

16:05.899 --> 16:10.101
um, on my own time,
I think, but, um,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.170
(Jillian moans happily)
Thank you for...

16:12.172 --> 16:15.440
for being there for me.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.742
STEWART: Okay, I know
he's working with someone.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.910
So let's go over the plan.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.445
Are you sure this
is a good idea, Stewart?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.281
Todd, if this were Dean's idea,
you'd be all over it.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.650
All over it, 100%. Okay, so...

16:25.652 --> 16:27.452
just you pretend
that I'm Dean, okay?

16:27.454 --> 16:30.021
Okay, that's a bit of a stretch,
Stew, but I'll-I'll try.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.289
All right.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.657
You are a real estate agent.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.525
I'm a real estate agent. All right?
You have gone

16:34.527 --> 16:37.195
to the apartment to
take pictures for a client.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.963
So once he lets you in,
you unlock the door,

16:38.965 --> 16:40.098
then you distract him...

16:40.100 --> 16:41.366
What kind of agency am I with?

16:41.368 --> 16:42.467
What?

16:42.469 --> 16:43.768
Like, is it a small,

16:43.770 --> 16:44.802
boutique agency,
where I know everyone?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.471
Or is it a big,
like, corporate agency,

16:46.473 --> 16:47.505
where I'm trying
to work my way up?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.873
What difference does it make?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.541
Well, Dean would have this
backstory worked out for me.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.877
You know what, then,
you make something up, okay?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.379
Oh, so it's like
an improv thing.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.114
Okay, well, what's a good name
for an agency?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.448
Forget the name
of the agency, Todd.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.449
No one's gonna ask
you that question.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.984
He's not gonna care.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.686
You don't think that's
the first thing he's gonna ask?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.721
I don't think he's gonna ask
you that at all, at any point.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.491
So, uh, what agency
did you say you work for?

17:06.493 --> 17:11.796
Oh, um, I'm, uh, just
between agencies right now.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.698
You know,
doing my freelance thing.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.966
You know.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.701
Do you mind if we go
take some pictures

17:16.703 --> 17:18.736
in your bedroom,
to show my clients?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.972
All right, yeah, just follow me,
all right?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.243
So, what kind of carpet is that?

17:25.245 --> 17:26.310
I don't know.

17:26.312 --> 17:27.745
I think it's just carpet.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.280
Oh.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.160
All right, man,
this is the room.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.161
Oh, this is cute!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.228
(camera clicks)

17:45.932 --> 17:47.498
TODD (in distance):
Big closets...

17:47.500 --> 17:50.334
are impressive!

17:50.336 --> 17:52.896
(Todd continues, indistinctly)

18:02.449 --> 18:03.948
(phone rings)

18:03.950 --> 18:05.510
(whispering): No.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.553
(whispers): Hello?

18:08.555 --> 18:10.254
DEBBIE: Honey, hey,
why are you whispering?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.255
I'm not.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.757
O-kay.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.258
Um, hey, can you pick up dinner

18:14.260 --> 18:15.259
for you and the kids on the way
home, please?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.061
Why? Why-why me?

18:17.063 --> 18:18.096
Because I'm working late.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.597
You know, honey,
I'm-I'm working, too.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.598
You are? On what?

18:20.600 --> 18:21.566
You're not at the office.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.201
I'm finding proof.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.435
Come on, I thought you

18:24.437 --> 18:25.636
gave up on all that
conspiracy crap.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.105
Well, I didn't, honey, I lied.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.539
Obviously, therapy doesn't
work that fast.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.607
That's what I've been saying
this whole time.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.075
Oh, I gotta go.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.377
I gotta... (hangs up)
What... Wait... are you... ugh.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.645
Come on, come on, come on...

18:34.647 --> 18:36.114
come on, come on, come on.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.081
So, that agency you were with,

18:37.083 --> 18:38.382
was it, like, a boutique

18:38.384 --> 18:39.417
type place, or...?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.786
Um, it's, uh, the agency,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.221
uh, it's...

18:43.223 --> 18:44.388
transitionary.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.924
TODD: Yeah, I guess we'll just

18:46.926 --> 18:49.760
go back into
the living room now.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.322
CORY: All right, man.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.500
(thudding, clattering)

19:02.308 --> 19:04.242
(whispering): Dean.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.043
Dean.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.446
Dean... (Dean gasps)

19:08.448 --> 19:10.081
Hi. Were you sleeping?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.316
Yeah, it's-it's the middle
of the night.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.018
I have to show you something.
Come meet me in the living room.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.153
Can it wait till the morning?
No.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.754
No, living room, now.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.090
(Dean sighs)

19:19.092 --> 19:20.291
Remember the flash drive

19:20.293 --> 19:21.626
I was telling you about?

19:21.628 --> 19:22.960
Well, Todd and I
snuck into Manler's apartment

19:22.962 --> 19:24.128
and copied all the files.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.596
Wh... you did what?! Stewart.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.597
What else was I supposed to do?

19:26.599 --> 19:27.532
No one would believe me.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.267
What are you guys
doing down here?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.035
Oh, oh, honey, perfect.
I was just about to show them

19:31.037 --> 19:34.272
all the proof I discovered
because I'm not crazy.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.275
All right, Manler is a pawn
working off of a script,

19:37.277 --> 19:38.609
and it's all right here.
Come here.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.011
Look, look, come here.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.048
Read it and weep.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.049
What's...

19:45.051 --> 19:46.117
What's this? What...

19:46.119 --> 19:47.185
What's happening?
JILLIAN: I don't know.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.953
This is proof
of nothing, actually.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.555
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, it was here.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.123
It was here. I-I sw... I promise.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.125
It was... It was right here.
I'm sure it was.

19:54.127 --> 19:55.726
Honey, why don't you
come back to bed?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.894
It was a virus.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.962
There must have been

19:57.964 --> 20:00.198
an encrypted virus.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.366
An "encrypted virus"? Bro...

20:02.368 --> 20:04.235
Stewart, you are
in a very dark place.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.870
No...

20:05.872 --> 20:07.405
I'm telling you the truth, guys.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.372
You don't believe me?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.207
Seriously?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.208
I believe you, honey.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.075
Really?

20:11.077 --> 20:12.577
Yeah, if you...

20:12.579 --> 20:14.178
say that an encrypted virus

20:14.180 --> 20:17.548
erased all the proof...

20:17.550 --> 20:18.916
I believe you.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.585
That was a nice
moment for you two.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.687
Hopefully one that'll
culminate in sex,

20:22.689 --> 20:24.255
'cause I know that that's
been a problem area.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.923
What?! I will explain it later.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.558
And if you guys need
any help at all,

20:27.560 --> 20:28.893
Oh, she's...
in that area, please...

20:28.895 --> 20:30.027
What area? Okay.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.028
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.096
(exhales) Whoa-uh.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.598
Easy, fella.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.399
Dean...

20:35.401 --> 20:37.768
I am asking you to trust me.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.770
There is more to this.

20:39.772 --> 20:40.938
I mean, come on,
you're always, you know,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.040
doing a stakeout, or-or-or,

20:43.042 --> 20:44.775
you know, flushing out a mole.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.777
I mean, none of this sounds
like anything to you?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.339
It does sound like something.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.918
It sounds like a TV show.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.088
Stewart, the real law
doesn't work like that.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.090
Real law is boring.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.425
It's paperwork and drudgery,

21:01.427 --> 21:03.060
and drones in an office.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.061
Testimony...

21:04.063 --> 21:05.863
jury selection...

21:05.865 --> 21:07.265
And you're trying
to make it sexy.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.400
But... hey, believe me, I get it.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.434
I've been there.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.370
But I am not going to let you

21:12.372 --> 21:14.205
make the same mistakes
that I did.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.406
But what if he's right?

21:15.408 --> 21:16.774
Oh, Deb...

21:16.776 --> 21:17.942
you're such a caregiver.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.311
Look, tomorrow,
I'm going to tell Dad

21:20.313 --> 21:22.446
that we need to get
other legal counsel, okay?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.448
I'm-I'm taking you off the case.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.616
You don't have the authority
to do that.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.051
I mean,
you didn't before, either,

21:27.053 --> 21:28.552
but you certainly don't,
now that you're an intern.

21:28.554 --> 21:32.056
I may be an intern,
but I am still my father's son.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.457
And he has
a Constitutional right

21:33.459 --> 21:35.826
to a fair trial.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.996
So, if you'll excuse me...

21:38.998 --> 21:40.965
I'm going to go make love
to my therapist.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.933
Oh, good.
I'll go freshen up for that.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.101
I thought when you
were "making love"

21:44.103 --> 21:45.436
she was your girlfriend.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.504
Yeah, we're trying
something different.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.471
Role-playing.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.472
You should think about it.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.840
It might help.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.009
Help what? We don't need help.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.027
