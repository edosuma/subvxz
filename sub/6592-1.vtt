00:27.600 --> 00:30.591
<i>My name is Jack McCall.</i>

00:31.204 --> 00:32.604
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

00:32.604 --> 00:36.041
<i>what you're listening to
is not the sound of my voice.</i>

00:37.610 --> 00:41.171
<i>It's the sound of my inner voice,
the one inside my head.</i>

00:43.449 --> 00:46.282
<i>I'd like to talk to you, but I can't.</i>

00:48.388 --> 00:51.585
<i>Because if I say
just one more sentence out loud,</i>

00:54.093 --> 00:55.355
<i>I'll die.</i>

01:15.381 --> 01:18.646
<i>Aaron, I have got
a very important assignment for you.</i>

01:18.718 --> 01:21.243
<i>Go to Barneys and get me six dozen
pair of cashmere blend socks,</i>

01:22.989 --> 01:24.718
<i>No, I'm gonna wear 'em,
but you're gonna buy 'em.</i>

01:25.391 --> 01:27.951
<i>Do I need six dozen pair
of cashmere socks? No, but listen.</i>

01:28.027 --> 01:29.016
<i>Hey, "need" is a tricky word.</i>

01:29.095 --> 01:31.120
<i>Think about it more like this,
"want" or "love" are better words.</i>

01:31.197 --> 01:32.755
Think about it.
Don't we do everything out of love?

01:32.832 --> 01:36.029
<i>How about this?
Do you want, need or love your job?</i>

01:36.102 --> 01:39.367
<i>Well, I love the idea
that you need your job. Okay.</i>

01:40.039 --> 01:41.870
Three white witches watch
three Swatch watches.

01:41.941 --> 01:44.432
Which witches watch
which watch switch...

01:45.344 --> 01:46.436
Okay.

01:46.512 --> 01:49.777
Daddy's gonna hold you
'cause Mommy needs caffeine.

01:52.852 --> 01:55.548
<i>Baby, I don't know
if I can work with, "Whaah!"</i>

01:56.089 --> 01:57.750
<i>Oh, look how happy he is
with his mommy.</i>

01:57.824 --> 01:59.587
<i>- Yeah.
- Yes, he is. He's a mama's boy.</i>

01:59.659 --> 02:00.648
<i>- No, he isn't.
- Yes.</i>

02:00.726 --> 02:02.921
There's nothing wrong with being
a mama's boy. I'm a mama's boy.

02:03.029 --> 02:04.553
<i>- Oh, my God!
- What?</i>

02:04.864 --> 02:07.799
Shaq snuck in the house
and shit in the baby's diaper!

02:07.867 --> 02:08.856
Hey!

02:20.279 --> 02:21.769
<i>Excuse me, you think
maybe I could cut in front...</i>

02:21.848 --> 02:24.180
I will run you over dead
in the parking lot.

02:24.951 --> 02:27.249
Dead. Dead. Dead.

02:36.562 --> 02:37.722
Hello?

02:38.564 --> 02:39.656
What? She's in labor?

02:40.433 --> 02:42.298
<i>Well, tell her to stop pushing!</i>

02:42.368 --> 02:44.029
<i>Look, I can't miss
the birth of my first child!</i>

02:44.103 --> 02:45.434
I only went out to get some coffee!

02:45.505 --> 02:47.871
Go ahead.
Expectant father coming through!

02:47.974 --> 02:49.134
I got a baby on the way! Thank you.
Thank you!

02:49.208 --> 02:50.232
<i>Congratulations, man! You're the man!</i>

02:50.309 --> 02:52.504
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much.

02:55.214 --> 02:57.478
Twins? It's twins!

02:57.550 --> 02:58.778
I'm having twins. I'm having twins.

02:59.385 --> 03:01.910
Thank you. It's on the house?
Thank you so much!

03:01.988 --> 03:03.455
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Congratulations!

03:04.891 --> 03:06.950
We live in a world
that's obsessive and controlling.

03:07.026 --> 03:09.221
<i>I think I care too much. I think
that's what you would say about me,</i>

03:09.295 --> 03:10.353
that I care too much.

03:10.429 --> 03:14.422
<i>I think that's what everybody would say
about me, that I care too much.</i>

03:14.500 --> 03:16.195
This coffee's incredible.
Do you ever stop to think about

03:16.269 --> 03:17.998
what people are thinking about
when you're not in the room?

03:18.070 --> 03:19.162
What do people think
when I'm not there?

03:19.238 --> 03:20.365
That's the thought that I want to know.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.805
What do people think
when I'm not there?

03:21.942 --> 03:23.239
<i>I know you think something
when I'm there,</i>

03:23.310 --> 03:24.800
<i>but when I'm not there,
what are you thinking?</i>

03:24.878 --> 03:25.970
What are you thinking
when I'm not in the room?

03:26.046 --> 03:28.344
That's the real thought. Or do you ever
wonder who's on line with you?

03:28.415 --> 03:30.781
You could be on line with somebody.
I'm not talking about the computer.

03:30.851 --> 03:32.284
<i>I'm talking about the real line,
the real line,</i>

03:32.352 --> 03:35.048
<i>the old-fashioned line with somebody
behind you, somebody in front of you.</i>

03:35.122 --> 03:37.113
That line is dangerous
'cause you don't know who that is.

03:37.191 --> 03:38.180
Or an elevator!

03:38.258 --> 03:40.624
<i>You're in a elevator, door closed,
you're in the room with this person.</i>

03:40.694 --> 03:43.162
They could pull out a knife
and start doing all kinds of shit to you.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.357
You get in elevators all the time.
Elevators are crazy.

03:45.499 --> 03:46.727
<i>Hey, what about restaurants?</i>

03:46.800 --> 03:49.792
You could be in a restaurant
sitting next to somebody who's a maniac

03:49.903 --> 03:52.997
<i>and they're right next to you in a chair,
and they're ordering like the same thing.</i>

03:53.073 --> 03:56.531
<i>Look at you smiling and this person just,
you know, stabbed somebody in the ass</i>

03:56.610 --> 03:57.941
and now they sitting
next to the table next to you.

03:58.011 --> 03:59.205
This could be happening all the time.

03:59.279 --> 04:01.372
Jack! If I may...

04:01.448 --> 04:03.609
<i>Hey, Doc,
I think we're about out of time.</i>

04:03.684 --> 04:04.776
But I feel so much better.

04:04.985 --> 04:07.783
<i>Thank you so much.
You know, you're a genius.</i>

04:12.759 --> 04:13.851
<i>Good morning, Mr. McCall.</i>

04:14.061 --> 04:16.188
I don't mean to be pushy
and I know you get hit up all the time.

04:16.262 --> 04:18.423
I was just wondering if you had
a chance to read my manuscript.

04:18.498 --> 04:21.023
Your manuscript?

04:21.101 --> 04:22.432
<i>Hey, Reverend Marcus.
How's my favorite client?</i>

04:22.502 --> 04:25.437
<i>I just need to know if I'm going home
to Nebraska, work on my dad's farm,</i>

04:25.505 --> 04:27.302
<i>or, you know,
maybe you could just read 20 pages.</i>

04:27.374 --> 04:29.774
<i>Hold on one second. Hey, look,
I'm getting closer on your manuscript.</i>

04:29.843 --> 04:31.367
<i>It's moved from my kitchen table
to my nightstand,</i>

04:31.445 --> 04:33.743
<i>and next, it'll be by my toilet
and that's where it'll get read, okay?</i>

04:33.814 --> 04:36.214
<i>Reverend, two words, "gripping"
and "necessary". Hold on one sec.</i>

04:36.283 --> 04:37.409
<i>Hey, can you do me a favor?</i>

04:37.484 --> 04:38.746
Can you polish my rims for me?

04:38.819 --> 04:41.117
And don't park my car
under the trees with all those birds?

04:41.188 --> 04:43.679
<i>Reverend, Lord, Where's My Money?
Is the best thing you've ever written.</i>

04:44.224 --> 04:46.249
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

04:47.628 --> 04:49.493
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

04:50.230 --> 04:52.061
<i>Jack McCall's office, please hold.</i>

04:52.132 --> 04:54.600
<i>You're already holding?
Okay, continue to hold. Thanks.</i>

04:55.102 --> 04:56.296
Jack McCall's office.

04:57.004 --> 04:59.871
<i>I don't care. Just take him to the vet.
I don't know, Mom!</i>

05:00.440 --> 05:01.464
<i>I don't... Mom, I got to go.</i>

05:01.541 --> 05:03.168
<i>Yes, I did have a great weekend.</i>

05:03.277 --> 05:05.108
<i>And, yes, I would like some coffee.</i>

05:05.178 --> 05:06.270
<i>I look good, right?</i>

05:06.780 --> 05:09.146
I finished picking out all the
mini-marshmallows out of your cereal.

05:09.249 --> 05:10.238
All the mini-marshmallows?

05:10.317 --> 05:12.808
<i>Except the yellow moons, obviously.</i>

05:13.720 --> 05:14.880
Mr. McCall?

05:15.622 --> 05:19.615
I know that I'm just an assistant.
And I really appreciate...

05:19.726 --> 05:21.023
<i>Hey, Aaron, this is my office.</i>

05:21.094 --> 05:22.857
<i>This isn't the confessional booth
at MTV, all right?</i>

05:22.929 --> 05:27.298
<i>No, no, I know. I know.
I would never confess. I'm just...</i>

05:27.367 --> 05:30.200
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that if I'm gonna

05:31.238 --> 05:33.832
<i>be an agent one day,
I'm not really sure how this...</i>

05:33.907 --> 05:36.068
<i>You have to speak like me,
talk like me, study me!</i>

05:36.143 --> 05:37.576
<i>Learn to speak your mind,
but do it quickly.</i>

05:37.644 --> 05:39.339
<i>You have to remember,
this is all part of your training.</i>

05:39.413 --> 05:43.747
<i>Okay. Okay, great.
I almost forgot. The weekend read.</i>

05:44.217 --> 05:45.946
<i>If I do say so myself,</i>

05:46.019 --> 05:49.853
I thought that the Antarctica submission
was pretty good. Have you read it?

05:50.023 --> 05:51.581
Absolutely not. Why would I do that?

05:51.658 --> 05:53.057
Let me explain something to you.

05:53.126 --> 05:55.754
All your best books have everything
you need to know in the first five pages

05:55.829 --> 05:57.797
<i>and the last five pages, okay?</i>

05:57.864 --> 05:59.456
Here we go. Woman meets man.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.091
Pregnant. War. Alone.

06:02.336 --> 06:04.998
War over. Baby older. New man.

06:05.072 --> 06:06.630
Happily ever after. Bestseller.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.829
Wow.

06:07.908 --> 06:09.102
Did you prepare the conference room?

06:09.176 --> 06:10.871
<i>Yeah. PowerPoint's all set up,
nobody knows a thing.</i>

06:11.345 --> 06:14.007
<i>Okay. Well, get out of here.</i>

06:15.615 --> 06:17.549
Everyone here is familiar with Dr. Sinja.

06:17.951 --> 06:19.543
Dr. Sinja is the most popular

06:19.619 --> 06:21.814
nondenominational religious leader
on the planet.

06:23.390 --> 06:27.451
He's a holistic healer
and a New Age dispenser of wisdom

06:27.561 --> 06:29.586
with a following in the tens of millions.

06:29.663 --> 06:32.723
This guy can fill up
a football stadium on a Tuesday.

06:33.133 --> 06:36.296
<i>Our conventional spirit guides
always ask the seeker,</i>

06:36.370 --> 06:37.769
<i>"What do you want?"</i>

06:37.871 --> 06:41.068
<i>I challenge you to ask yourself,</i>

06:41.775 --> 06:44.107
<i>"What does life want from me?"</i>

06:44.711 --> 06:49.671
<i>"What does the greater purpose
want from me?"</i>

06:49.750 --> 06:52.310
Look at this guy's attendance figures.

06:52.386 --> 06:55.184
<i>He's outselling Céline Dion, U2,</i>

06:55.255 --> 06:57.553
Billy Graham and Hannah Montana!

06:57.758 --> 06:59.589
What's his actual philosophy?

07:00.394 --> 07:04.194
<i>"In quiet, there is truth. "
Some shit like that. Something like that.</i>

07:04.264 --> 07:06.630
Just your typical New Age bullshit crap.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.260
That's what my Aunt May used to call it.
New Age bullshit crap.

07:09.536 --> 07:12.505
<i>And if anybody can sell
some New Age bullshit crap, it's me.</i>

07:12.572 --> 07:14.597
<i>Jack, it's a spiritual movement.</i>

07:14.741 --> 07:17.403
<i>Yeah, I have a spiritual movement
every time I eat a bran muffin.</i>

07:17.911 --> 07:19.811
<i>- God!
- All right, all right, Jack.</i>

07:19.880 --> 07:22.280
<i>Assuming you can actually
get an audience with the guy,</i>

07:22.349 --> 07:24.476
you're not the only agent in town
who has this information.

07:24.551 --> 07:26.985
What makes you think
you can talk Sinja into signing with you?

07:27.387 --> 07:30.083
I'm Jack McCall. This is what I do.

07:30.157 --> 07:33.320
<i>Hey, I can talk anybody
into doing anything.</i>

08:03.323 --> 08:04.756
<i>Help me sing it</i>

08:12.933 --> 08:13.957
Breathe in.

08:15.068 --> 08:16.467
And release.

08:18.338 --> 08:22.604
Quiet your mind
until there are no thoughts.

08:23.143 --> 08:26.510
Then you can see your true nature.

08:27.547 --> 08:30.038
Your face
before your parents were born.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.144
"Your face
before your parents were born"?

08:32.219 --> 08:34.482
That's a great title for a kids' show.

08:34.554 --> 08:35.782
It has many names.

08:36.823 --> 08:40.657
<i>Nirvana, kensho, bliss,</i>

08:41.126 --> 08:44.824
<i>divinity, illumination.
Let's call it the Blue Pearl.</i>

08:47.300 --> 08:50.269
It's okay. Our truth can be painful.

08:51.204 --> 08:53.104
Pain is the touchstone of growth.

08:54.341 --> 08:56.502
- That'd be a badass T-shirt.
- It's okay.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.508
<i>Laugh, cry. They're close cousins.</i>

08:59.579 --> 09:01.877
Just let it out.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.325
He sees the Blue Pearl.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.988
It's okay. It's okay.

09:27.008 --> 09:29.169
Students meditate for years

09:29.243 --> 09:31.871
and never see
what you have seen today.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.607
Your inner self.

09:33.681 --> 09:36.013
<i>That makes you
a very special person, Mr...</i>

09:36.083 --> 09:37.107
McCall.

09:37.485 --> 09:39.282
Jack McCall. Thank you so much.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.549
<i>Sorry, I don't know what happened.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:48.424
I just got overcome with emotion.
I'm sorry.

09:48.496 --> 09:49.793
My years and years of focused silence

09:49.931 --> 09:52.923
just finally delivered me to...

09:53.000 --> 09:55.400
<i>- Enlightenment?
- Enlightenment, yes. Enlightenment.</i>

09:57.104 --> 09:58.731
Sorry. Hold that a second.

09:59.040 --> 10:02.168
I'm so sorry.
Play it four times and it stops.

10:12.186 --> 10:13.380
That is bad.

10:16.223 --> 10:17.212
<i>Oh, the Blue Pearl.</i>

10:17.758 --> 10:19.692
The Blue Pearl is so blue.

10:19.794 --> 10:21.819
The Blue Pearl is so shiny

10:23.030 --> 10:24.429
and so pearly.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.097
"Three things will not long be hidden.

10:29.270 --> 10:31.261
<i>"The sun, the moon,</i>

10:32.807 --> 10:34.798
"and the truth. "

10:34.875 --> 10:37.503
<i>Is there a reason for your visit today,
Jack McCall?</i>

10:37.578 --> 10:39.739
<i>Well, sir, I am not one to waste time.</i>

10:39.814 --> 10:40.872
I understand you've written a book.

10:41.649 --> 10:42.638
That is true.

10:42.717 --> 10:45.242
<i>Well, I'm an agent.</i>

10:45.319 --> 10:47.446
And all my career
I've dreamed that I'd get to represent

10:47.521 --> 10:49.989
someone who I believed in.
I believe in you.

10:50.825 --> 10:53.726
And I think
I can help you to change the world.

10:55.730 --> 10:56.754
I'm not interested.

10:59.266 --> 11:00.255
Really?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.200
<i>Dr. Sinja? Dr. Sinja, the world</i>

11:03.437 --> 11:07.203
<i>is filled with lost,
lonely souls in need of your wisdom.</i>

11:07.274 --> 11:08.502
And they're out there calling out to you

11:08.909 --> 11:12.276
<i>in quiet desperation.
I hear them, I feel them.</i>

11:12.346 --> 11:14.371
Aren't you amazed by trees?

11:15.683 --> 11:16.945
<i>Yeah, sure!</i>

11:17.018 --> 11:18.576
I love trees!

11:18.653 --> 11:21.121
<i>Trees, I love them. I love trees.</i>

11:21.188 --> 11:23.679
The branches and the leaves. It's just...

11:23.758 --> 11:25.191
<i>You know,
some people want fame and money.</i>

11:25.259 --> 11:28.023
<i>Just give me some nature,
some branches and some trees.</i>

11:28.095 --> 11:29.084
I love it.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.488
<i>In fact,
I have such an affinity towards trees</i>

11:31.565 --> 11:33.328
I think I might even
have been a bird in another life.

11:34.001 --> 11:36.367
Just...

11:37.705 --> 11:40.606
Landing on a branch. Taking it all in.

11:41.676 --> 11:45.442
I want to be a bird. I want to be a bird
and I want to swallow your philosophy.

11:45.513 --> 11:46.810
And then I'm gonna spit it back
into the mouths

11:46.881 --> 11:47.870
of the children of the world.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.048
<i>Nourish their souls. Help you to grow,
watch your wings spread,</i>

11:52.486 --> 11:53.976
and help you to soar.

11:54.989 --> 11:56.047
What are you talking about?

11:57.058 --> 12:00.152
I'm talking about
presenting your book to the world.

12:00.227 --> 12:01.558
Have you read it?

12:01.629 --> 12:04.564
Of course I have.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.827
So what's in it for you?

12:07.134 --> 12:11.036
Just the satisfaction of knowing
that I helped my hero to save the world.

12:14.241 --> 12:15.572
Shit!

12:16.777 --> 12:18.039
The tree gave me a splinter!

12:18.379 --> 12:21.212
The Bodhi tree did nothing.
It did not move.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.910
<i>We all create our own destiny, Jack.</i>

12:24.752 --> 12:29.189
<i>Dr. Sinja, if you commit to me,
I'll give you all that I am.</i>

12:29.256 --> 12:31.554
<i>Mind, body and spirit. Everything.</i>

12:33.694 --> 12:35.491
Let me be a big bird.

12:36.030 --> 12:37.190
Hawk!

12:37.932 --> 12:39.957
Or sparrow.

12:40.034 --> 12:41.433
<i>Pick a bird, I'm it.</i>

12:42.436 --> 12:44.233
You agree to have my book published?

12:44.605 --> 12:47.233
I'm begging you for it!

12:47.308 --> 12:51.438
And you will spread my philosophy
in the way I meant it to be spread?

12:51.512 --> 12:53.241
<i>That goes without saying.
You have my word, sir.</i>

12:56.383 --> 12:58.874
<i>Remember, our words have a profound</i>

12:58.953 --> 13:01.217
rippling effect on the entire universe.

13:01.288 --> 13:03.381
<i>Well, I'm counting on that.</i>

13:04.625 --> 13:05.887
<i>- Jack McCall's office.
- Aaron!</i>

13:06.026 --> 13:07.755
<i>I want you to run out
and buy me a throne,</i>

13:07.828 --> 13:10.422
<i>and a scepter and a crown,
because I am the king!</i>

13:11.265 --> 13:13.256
<i>Oh, my God, Mr. McCall.
You signed him, didn't you?</i>

13:13.334 --> 13:15.234
You bet your ass I signed him.

13:15.302 --> 13:17.133
Never doubt me! Never doubt me!

13:17.338 --> 13:18.327
<i>How about that?</i>

13:18.405 --> 13:20.236
<i>Hey, I want you to clear
my schedule for the rest of the day.</i>

13:20.441 --> 13:22.170
I want to go spend some time
with my mother!

13:22.243 --> 13:24.006
Let her know what a big star her boy is!

13:24.211 --> 13:25.405
<i>Okay, done, sire.</i>

13:37.758 --> 13:39.953
Raymond! Is that you?

13:40.027 --> 13:43.758
<i>No, it's not Raymond.
It's Jack, Ma. Your son, Jack.</i>

13:44.398 --> 13:47.993
<i>Raymond,
I knew you wouldn't miss my birthday.</i>

13:48.068 --> 13:50.366
<i>I'm not Raymond. I'm Jack, Ma.</i>

13:50.437 --> 13:52.598
<i>Oh, you look good, Raymond.</i>

13:53.274 --> 13:55.799
<i>Mommy, Raymond was your husband.</i>

13:55.876 --> 13:57.138
<i>He left. I'm your son, Jack.</i>

13:57.211 --> 13:59.145
I stayed. You raised me. Remember?

13:59.980 --> 14:02.039
<i>- How you doing, Emily?
- Hey, Jack.</i>

14:02.116 --> 14:04.243
<i>Okay, Annie,
now that your guest is here,</i>

14:04.318 --> 14:05.808
we can have some dinner.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.684
<i>Sorry to keep calling you,
but she's slipping a bit more these days.</i>

14:08.756 --> 14:10.121
Now she won't eat without Raymond.

14:10.691 --> 14:11.988
Raymond is your dad?

14:12.059 --> 14:13.390
<i>Yeah, he was. He's dead now.</i>

14:13.460 --> 14:15.360
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

14:15.663 --> 14:17.528
You sure she should be drinking
these margaritas?

14:17.598 --> 14:18.860
Don't worry.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.527
<i>'Cause unlike me,
these margaritas are virgins.</i>

14:23.037 --> 14:25.005
<i>Speaking of which, hey, Milt!</i>

14:25.639 --> 14:29.006
<i>I can see your cojones in that pantsuit.</i>

14:29.076 --> 14:32.045
It's like you're smuggling walnuts
in a polyester purse!

14:32.112 --> 14:33.602
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

14:33.681 --> 14:37.048
Tonight it's fajitas
and taquitos with fresh guacamole.

14:37.117 --> 14:38.675
<i>Oh, gracias, Tim.</i>

14:39.787 --> 14:42.085
<i>How you doin', Mom? You okay?</i>

14:42.156 --> 14:45.489
Look at that suit.
You look like a gangster.

14:47.361 --> 14:49.387
Why don't you wear
that suit we got married in?

14:49.898 --> 14:51.729
<i>Because I'm Jack, your son, Ma,</i>

14:51.800 --> 14:54.132
and I got to wear clothes like this
because I need it for my work.

14:54.202 --> 14:56.966
<i>I'm a big agent, remember?
Hey, I made a big deal today.</i>

14:57.739 --> 14:58.831
Jack?

14:59.541 --> 15:03.500
<i>Raymond,
Jack never forgave you for leaving.</i>

15:03.578 --> 15:06.069
- Ma!
- And Jack missed my birthday again.

15:06.147 --> 15:08.911
<i>Mom, I'm Jack. I'm your son. I'm here!</i>

15:10.385 --> 15:11.477
What?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.316
<i>Happy birthday, Mom.</i>

15:20.362 --> 15:22.330
And Caroline says hello.

15:30.572 --> 15:32.096
<i>Raymond,</i>

15:32.173 --> 15:33.970
is that you?

15:35.810 --> 15:38.176
<i>No, Ma. It's me, Jack. Your son.</i>

15:41.750 --> 15:45.186
<i>I'm going to get going now
and get back to work, so...</i>

15:49.291 --> 15:50.553
Love you.

16:00.402 --> 16:02.336
<i>Hola, Gaudencio. You're here late, huh?</i>

16:02.404 --> 16:06.898
<i>Hi, Mr. McCall.
The sprinkler, it die, but I fix it.</i>

16:10.612 --> 16:12.671
Okay.

16:12.747 --> 16:15.648
<i>This is it. It's a beautiful house, Jack.</i>

16:16.451 --> 16:17.884
The neighborhood is so sweet.

16:17.953 --> 16:19.420
There are kids everywhere.

16:19.487 --> 16:20.511
<i>While I was there,</i>

16:20.588 --> 16:23.284
an ice cream truck
actually came through.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.417
<i>I mean, it's just...</i>

16:26.227 --> 16:27.888
It's perfect for us.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.022
But this house is perfect for us.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.056
We made Tyler in this house.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.430
We made Tyler in this room.

16:33.501 --> 16:36.026
We made Tyler on this table. Tyler...

16:36.104 --> 16:40.734
<i>Okay. If we're going to stay
in this house, which I'm willing to do,</i>

16:40.809 --> 16:42.606
we have to do some work
to make it safer.

16:42.978 --> 16:44.502
More family friendly.

16:44.579 --> 16:46.706
What are you talking about?
This place is perfectly safe.

16:46.781 --> 16:50.217
<i>No. Look, just beyond
these polished concrete floors</i>

16:50.285 --> 16:51.843
is a non-fenced pool

16:52.287 --> 16:56.121
<i>that backs up to a cliff
with a sheer drop of 2,000 feet.</i>

16:58.893 --> 17:00.326
<i>Well, look,
maybe we should let the kid grow up</i>

17:00.395 --> 17:02.329
and tell us where he wants to live.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.387
It's a bachelor pad!

17:04.465 --> 17:05.454
He's a bachelor!

17:05.532 --> 17:08.434
Okay.
We cannot raise a family in this house.

17:08.502 --> 17:10.528
<i>Hey, look,
I bought this house on my potential</i>

17:10.605 --> 17:11.970
and then I earned it. I love this house.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.531
<i>I love it, too,
but I'm changing Tyler at the bar.</i>

17:16.444 --> 17:18.002
He sleeps in your media room.

17:18.113 --> 17:20.637
It's like we're guests in your house.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.777
It's just time.

17:24.019 --> 17:26.419
<i>You know, moving is a huge change.</i>

17:26.488 --> 17:30.754
<i>I know, but so was getting married,</i>

17:30.825 --> 17:32.622
and having a baby.

17:32.694 --> 17:36.130
<i>And those turned out
to be really nice changes, right?</i>

17:41.069 --> 17:42.058
<i>Okay, let's do it.</i>

17:42.704 --> 17:43.898
Really?

17:45.740 --> 17:47.640
Let's paint the media room.

17:48.176 --> 17:51.543
<i>Yeah, let's put some ducks in there
and some cartoon figures</i>

17:51.613 --> 17:53.240
<i>and, you know,
just keep it mid-century modern, though.</i>

17:53.314 --> 17:54.303
Mid-century modern ducks.

17:54.382 --> 17:56.179
<i>- Yeah, mid-century modern and ducks.
- That's fantastic.</i>

17:56.251 --> 17:57.513
That actually sounds kinda hot.

17:57.685 --> 18:00.415
<i>An all new low for you, Jack.</i>

18:00.488 --> 18:02.513
<i>- Hey, now what are you doing?
- I'm cleaning up.</i>

18:11.266 --> 18:13.393
- What the hell was that?
- An earthquake?

18:13.601 --> 18:16.502
I've been in an earthquake.
That wasn't an earthquake.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.733
I'm gonna check on Tyler!

18:42.397 --> 18:44.888
<i>This is a beautiful tree, my friend.</i>

18:44.966 --> 18:46.433
<i>Please, tell me
why you would plant a tree</i>

18:46.501 --> 18:47.900
right in the middle of the patio.

18:47.969 --> 18:49.368
I no plant the tree.

18:49.437 --> 18:50.734
You no plant the tree?

18:50.805 --> 18:53.171
I've been here all day
fixing the sprinkler.

18:53.241 --> 18:54.902
I coming back to pick up my things

18:54.976 --> 18:56.967
<i>and, boom, it's a tree here.</i>

18:57.045 --> 18:58.376
<i>"Boom, it's a tree here"?</i>

18:58.446 --> 18:59.538
Boom.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.818
<i>Hey, this is that tree that bit me.</i>

19:06.254 --> 19:07.619
Why the hell would he send me
something like this?

19:07.689 --> 19:09.884
<i>What, is this a joke or something?</i>

19:09.958 --> 19:10.947
He must think it's a gift.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.593
<i>Well, now I'm stuck
with this goddamned thing?</i>

19:14.662 --> 19:17.495
<i>I was gonna just send him a nice wine
or, you know,</i>

19:17.565 --> 19:19.260
a Harry and David's Fruit of the Month.

19:19.334 --> 19:22.963
Or a massage. Or Mrs. Fields cookies.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.062
Exactly.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.903
You want me to get rid of it?

19:26.975 --> 19:30.809
<i>No, I gotta make nice.
I'll keep it. This is my tree now.</i>

19:31.946 --> 19:35.712
<i>- Okay, Mr. McCall. See you mañana.
- Thanks.</i>

19:41.055 --> 19:42.454
Sorta classy.

19:56.504 --> 19:57.732
<i>- Mr. McCall?
- Faster, Aaron.</i>

19:57.805 --> 19:59.898
<i>Please, be less dumb,
but be quicker about it.</i>

19:59.974 --> 20:01.635
I got a splitting headache today.

20:01.709 --> 20:02.698
Are you sick?

20:02.777 --> 20:05.143
<i>No, I think I'm having
an allergic reaction or something.</i>

20:05.213 --> 20:08.580
<i>Well, this should cheer you up.
Here's your crown.</i>

20:08.650 --> 20:09.912
And the throne's on order.

20:09.984 --> 20:12.817
<i>But they offered me a scepter,
so I bought it.</i>

20:14.689 --> 20:15.781
Are you a moron?

20:16.558 --> 20:17.547
No.

20:18.459 --> 20:21.121
<i>So Sinja sent his book over, and...</i>

20:21.196 --> 20:22.595
- How great is it?
- You read it?

20:23.331 --> 20:24.525
How many times
do we have to go through this?

20:24.599 --> 20:25.793
I don't read!

20:25.867 --> 20:27.164
<i>Once again, how was Sinja's book?</i>

20:27.235 --> 20:28.759
<i>No, let me tell you.
It was scintillating, huh?</i>

20:28.836 --> 20:30.770
<i>You couldn't stop reading it, just like it
was your latest copy</i>

20:30.838 --> 20:31.863
<i>of Juggs magazine, right?</i>

20:32.308 --> 20:34.503
<i>It is a quick read, that's fair.</i>

20:34.577 --> 20:35.839
<i>Way to go, Sinja!</i>

20:35.911 --> 20:38.106
It's almost like the book was written
for you.

20:38.180 --> 20:39.807
<i>Of course it was! Listen, this book is...</i>

20:39.882 --> 20:41.474
Five pages long.

20:46.488 --> 20:48.046
Five pages long?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.715
Five pages long.

20:50.793 --> 20:52.226
<i>As in one, two, three, four...</i>

20:52.294 --> 20:53.989
Five. The end.

20:55.397 --> 20:57.194
But look at it this way.
It's the perfect book for you

20:57.266 --> 20:58.563
because the first five pages

20:58.634 --> 21:01.330
and the last five pages
are the whole book.

21:02.438 --> 21:03.564
<i>Okay, Aaron, come on.</i>

21:03.639 --> 21:05.266
<i>Tell me that you're pulling my pecker
on this one, right?</i>

21:05.441 --> 21:07.466
<i>Oh, I wish I could.</i>

21:07.543 --> 21:08.874
<i>I mean, not your pecker, but...</i>

21:09.645 --> 21:10.634
Let me see it.

21:11.847 --> 21:13.644
- My...
- The book!

21:18.053 --> 21:19.077
No.

21:19.989 --> 21:22.423
- That's the book?
- That's the book.

21:30.532 --> 21:32.727
<i>Okay. Okay,
I'm gonna go down to that ashram</i>

21:32.801 --> 21:34.603
and I'm gonna ram this up his ass!

21:34.770 --> 21:36.032
<i>It's just the dedication, right?</i>

21:36.105 --> 21:38.835
Or the teaser? Or the thank you's.

21:38.907 --> 21:41.774
<i>Jack, you said you loved my book.</i>

21:41.844 --> 21:43.835
<i>That wasn't a book you gave me,
it was a pamphlet!</i>

21:43.912 --> 21:45.243
I've read menus that were longer!

21:45.314 --> 21:47.407
I read a stop sign on the way here
that was longer than that!

21:47.483 --> 21:51.817
<i>Now, my book
is a journey of self-discovery.</i>

21:51.887 --> 21:54.947
<i>Now, that journey is fulfilled
by page five.</i>

21:55.024 --> 21:56.116
<i>Okay, it's coming together now.</i>

21:56.191 --> 21:57.556
<i>You know, you got
a lot of tricks up your sleeve.</i>

21:57.626 --> 22:00.493
<i>First, the magic tree.
Then the book with five pages.</i>

22:00.562 --> 22:02.223
What's next?
You gonna get on a magic yoga mat

22:02.298 --> 22:03.492
and fly around in a circle?

22:03.565 --> 22:05.328
<i>Then you rub your stomach,
but then, whoosh,</i>

22:05.401 --> 22:07.301
the genie jumps out of my ass?

22:09.138 --> 22:11.333
<i>Bless you, Jack. Are you okay?</i>

22:11.407 --> 22:13.068
I'm having an allergic reaction.

22:13.142 --> 22:14.939
It's probably from that tree you sent me.

22:15.444 --> 22:17.105
I sent you a tree?

22:18.013 --> 22:19.139
See?

22:19.982 --> 22:22.712
So this is where the tree went.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.644
What?

22:25.254 --> 22:26.278
Interesting.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.387
What's so interesting?

22:29.658 --> 22:31.785
These branches
don't have a single leaf.

22:32.428 --> 22:33.759
<i>You know, I noticed that, too.</i>

22:39.335 --> 22:40.324
Jack?

22:42.137 --> 22:44.628
Look at the tree and say something.

22:47.676 --> 22:48.665
Say what?

22:53.682 --> 22:54.842
What's so funny?

22:55.617 --> 22:57.585
This is amazing. Don't you see?

23:00.089 --> 23:02.683
<i>Hey, you know, it almost seems
like every time I say something,</i>

23:02.758 --> 23:04.248
some of the...

23:13.902 --> 23:15.062
Hello?

23:20.542 --> 23:21.600
Hel...

23:23.245 --> 23:24.303
...lo!

23:29.284 --> 23:30.774
<i>I want my baby back
baby back, baby back</i>

23:30.853 --> 23:32.844
<i>I want my baby back, baby back ribs</i>

23:34.990 --> 23:36.082
Shit!

23:37.526 --> 23:39.050
<i>Hey, how are you doing this?</i>

23:39.128 --> 23:40.993
Me? I'm doing nothing.

23:42.097 --> 23:44.361
You and this tree are now connected.

23:44.433 --> 23:45.900
Connected?

23:47.469 --> 23:49.733
It seems like
all your talking is making you sick.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.439
<i>Hey, my talking is not making me sick.</i>

23:52.608 --> 23:57.545
<i>Oh, really? What happens
when a tree loses all its leaves, Jack?</i>

23:57.613 --> 23:58.807
<i>So what are you trying to say, Sinja?</i>

23:59.348 --> 24:01.578
<i>It's obvious to me, the more you talk,</i>

24:01.650 --> 24:03.743
<i>the more leaves fall, the sicker you get.</i>

24:04.219 --> 24:05.516
The sicker I get?

24:05.587 --> 24:07.316
So what happens
if all the leaves fall off the tree?

24:08.791 --> 24:10.759
That usually means the tree is dead.

24:11.527 --> 24:12.824
<i>Hey, wait a second. Hold on a second.</i>

24:12.895 --> 24:14.055
You telling me that you think

24:14.129 --> 24:16.120
whatever happens to the tree
happens to me?

24:16.198 --> 24:17.187
Yes.

24:18.801 --> 24:20.530
So I could die!

24:20.602 --> 24:24.060
<i>Yes, but you would die
in the most amazing way possible.</i>

24:24.339 --> 24:25.829
I could die?

24:25.908 --> 24:28.502
Or someone could turn you
into a coffee table.

24:28.577 --> 24:30.340
<i>Hey, Sinja, you know,
you're a real funny dude to stand here</i>

24:30.412 --> 24:33.438
making jokes when my life
is being controlled by this magic tree!

24:34.249 --> 24:36.274
How many leaves
you think are left on this tree?

24:37.152 --> 24:38.517
A thousand?

24:39.354 --> 24:40.912
<i>So what do I got, a thousand words left?</i>

24:42.324 --> 24:44.417
Now you have 993.

24:45.494 --> 24:47.223
<i>One word, one leaf.</i>

24:50.999 --> 24:53.627
<i>Well, I know how to make this shit stop.</i>

24:57.306 --> 24:58.773
<i>Oh, no, no, you shouldn't do this.</i>

24:59.174 --> 25:01.108
<i>- That is murder!
- Yeah, and it's premeditated, too!</i>

25:01.176 --> 25:02.666
<i>Jack, you shouldn't do this!</i>

25:02.744 --> 25:05.304
<i>You know what, Sinja?
You worry about pages six through 200</i>

25:05.380 --> 25:07.507
and you let me worry
about Mr. Tricky Tree over here!

25:07.583 --> 25:09.983
<i>And on that note, one last final word!</i>

25:10.052 --> 25:11.519
Timber!

25:21.697 --> 25:23.756
Be glad you don't own a chainsaw.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.024
Why did you do this to me?

25:26.101 --> 25:28.194
I didn't do this. I wouldn't know how.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.703
<i>So, what, the universe cursed me?</i>

25:29.771 --> 25:33.468
Maybe.
This is between you and the tree.

25:33.542 --> 25:36.443
<i>Hey, wait a minute. If this is real,
what am I supposed to do?</i>

25:36.512 --> 25:38.537
You ever heard of this before?
You ever seen anything like this?

25:38.981 --> 25:40.141
<i>I've never seen it,</i>

25:40.215 --> 25:42.911
but there is a story
of an old monk that had a tree like this.

25:42.985 --> 25:45.112
I always thought it was just a story.

25:45.187 --> 25:47.087
He became very famous and honored.

25:47.456 --> 25:48.445
So he lived.

25:48.524 --> 25:50.014
<i>No, he died.</i>

25:50.092 --> 25:51.116
Jesus.

25:51.193 --> 25:53.957
<i>No, his name was Stan.</i>

25:54.029 --> 25:55.690
I'm leaving for Bolivia tonight.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.324
A spiritual retreat
in Potosí called La Paz.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.198
Let me talk to my colleagues there
about you and your tree.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.862
<i>Bolivia? Well, when you coming back?</i>

26:03.438 --> 26:04.666
- In three days.
- Three days?

26:04.740 --> 26:06.173
What am I supposed to do until then?

26:06.241 --> 26:08.209
<i>If I were you, Jack, I'd be quiet.</i>

26:08.577 --> 26:11.569
Don't talk for three days.
How hard can it be?

26:17.353 --> 26:18.377
Hello!

26:20.790 --> 26:21.779
Shit.

26:23.326 --> 26:24.452
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

26:24.694 --> 26:26.889
What is the purpose
in cursing you with a tree

26:26.963 --> 26:30.490
that loses a leaf
with every word you speak?

26:30.567 --> 26:32.467
That is ridiculous!

26:35.538 --> 26:37.335
I guess you're right.

26:39.342 --> 26:40.366
It's crazy!

26:40.443 --> 26:42.104
It's ridiculous!

26:48.418 --> 26:49.476
Did you see that?

26:49.552 --> 26:50.780
See what?

26:50.853 --> 26:54.289
<i>A leaf with every word!
Jack, you slay me!</i>

26:56.593 --> 26:58.618
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus!
God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, my God!</i>

26:58.695 --> 27:01.425
<i>God, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God!</i>

27:18.047 --> 27:19.275
Morning.

28:16.272 --> 28:19.764
<i>Good morning, sir.
What can I get started for you today?</i>

28:21.377 --> 28:22.708
What size?

28:23.846 --> 28:25.814
<i>All right, three venti lattes.</i>

28:26.449 --> 28:29.145
Would you care for a pastry? No?

28:31.721 --> 28:33.985
<i>Oh, mocha! Three mocha lattes.</i>

28:37.060 --> 28:40.154
Double chocolate-chip muffin! Yum!

28:45.968 --> 28:48.698
You want three Paul McCartney CDs.
Awesome.

28:49.005 --> 28:52.372
<i>You know, I love the Beatles.
They are my life.</i>

28:57.413 --> 28:59.142
Assassination! Abraham Lincoln!

29:00.516 --> 29:04.008
<i>You, me, gun, shoot!</i>

29:06.022 --> 29:07.011
Three shots.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.986
<i>I know, I'm a little slow today.</i>

29:12.228 --> 29:15.755
<i>All right, so three lattes, three mochas,</i>

29:15.832 --> 29:18.460
double chocolate-chip muffin
and three shots.

29:18.701 --> 29:20.828
No assassinations.

29:20.903 --> 29:23.064
And three Paul McCartney CDs.

29:23.940 --> 29:25.464
That's gonna be $68.12.

29:38.588 --> 29:40.852
Could you tell me when
it's safe to cross?

29:42.892 --> 29:45.156
<i>Are you deaf? I said,</i>

29:45.661 --> 29:48.528
"Can you tell me
when it's safe to cross?"

29:50.767 --> 29:52.632
<i>It is? Thanks, fella!</i>

30:00.810 --> 30:02.243
<i>Stop it, stop it, stop it!</i>

30:11.988 --> 30:14.980
<i>Hey, my brother, what's happening,
brother? What's going on?</i>

30:15.825 --> 30:17.520
Hey! Was that a drive-by?
What was that?

30:17.593 --> 30:18.992
<i>Somebody tell me, was that a drive-by?</i>

30:23.599 --> 30:25.726
<i>Thanks, son! White people sure is nice!</i>

30:56.999 --> 30:58.125
<i>Hey, Mr. McCall.</i>

30:58.367 --> 31:01.063
<i>Hey, about my book,
any chance you read it yet?</i>

31:01.137 --> 31:03.469
<i>Great story, right?</i>

31:03.539 --> 31:07.305
<i>Oh, you did read it.
Oh, God, and you hate the story.</i>

31:07.977 --> 31:09.274
<i>Okay, but the writing is good, right?</i>

31:10.646 --> 31:13.012
<i>No? Well, why don't you lie to me?</i>

31:13.082 --> 31:15.448
You've been lying to me for three years
about how you couldn't read it.

31:15.518 --> 31:16.576
<i>Now suddenly you read it, you hate it,</i>

31:16.652 --> 31:18.415
it sucks and you just smash my hopes

31:18.487 --> 31:20.614
<i>on the rocks of
"Hey, Wayne, go back to Nebraska</i>

31:20.690 --> 31:21.782
"and shave sheep with your dad. "

31:22.458 --> 31:25.484
You don't know what it's like
to be a writer. I hate myself.

31:25.561 --> 31:28.359
<i>I hate myself, do you get that?
I hate myself!</i>

31:34.470 --> 31:36.836
I'll park your car.

31:36.906 --> 31:39.204
<i>Yeah, I'll park your car,
Mr. Encouragement.</i>

31:39.342 --> 31:40.639
<i>Mr. McCall, thank God you're here.</i>

31:40.710 --> 31:42.371
I have a lot of messages.

31:42.445 --> 31:44.310
Do you want to start with the most
recent or the most urgent?

31:44.647 --> 31:46.046
<i>You got a sore throat? Okay, don't talk.</i>

31:47.650 --> 31:50.141
Okay. How about some tea?

31:50.219 --> 31:53.086
Cough medicine?
How about a notepad to write on?

31:55.258 --> 31:56.748
Okay.

31:56.826 --> 32:00.524
<i>Well, then how am I supposed to know
what you want me to...</i>

32:01.765 --> 32:04.495
<i>Mr. McCall, are you not speaking to me
because you're mad at me?</i>

32:05.769 --> 32:08.602
<i>You found out that I left work early
yesterday. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

32:08.672 --> 32:10.833
<i>Okay, I have stomach problems</i>

32:10.908 --> 32:13.468
and I had to run home
because I can't use public bathrooms.

32:13.610 --> 32:15.510
I'm seeing a therapist about it.

32:15.679 --> 32:16.771
Okay.

32:17.814 --> 32:20.009
<i>Jack, is this about the Christmas party?</i>

32:20.150 --> 32:21.139
I'm so sorry.

32:21.218 --> 32:23.550
<i>That was the peach schnapps
that tried to kiss your wife, not me.</i>

32:23.620 --> 32:25.019
<i>I mean, I don't want to kiss your wife,</i>

32:25.088 --> 32:26.385
even though her lips felt like heaven.

32:27.524 --> 32:28.513
I'm gonna go.

32:34.298 --> 32:36.163
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

32:37.134 --> 32:40.535
You found my video camera
with the furry tapes.

32:41.371 --> 32:42.497
<i>Pardon me, Mr. McCall.</i>

32:42.572 --> 32:43.561
Samantha asked me to get you.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.073
She wants to introduce you
to somebody.

32:45.175 --> 32:46.767
<i>Yeah, Mary, the jig's up, okay?</i>

32:46.843 --> 32:48.208
<i>He knows what we do in here,</i>

32:48.278 --> 32:51.873
<i>in his office, after work,
on his desk, in his chair.</i>

32:52.215 --> 32:54.012
<i>Mr. McCall, I just want to say, first of all,</i>

32:54.084 --> 32:56.382
<i>you know, she's the one that always
wanted to be the filthier animals,</i>

32:56.453 --> 32:59.251
like the skunk and the naughty beaver.

32:59.323 --> 33:00.847
I tried to be the more dignified animals

33:00.924 --> 33:02.983
like the wolf
and the California black bear.

33:03.060 --> 33:04.049
<i>And don't hurt me, I'm sorry.</i>

33:04.127 --> 33:07.096
It's just this sexual hunger I have.
It's insatiable.

33:07.164 --> 33:08.495
<i>I mean, you understand. You're a...</i>

33:09.099 --> 33:11.795
You want to go outside
and settle this like men?

33:11.868 --> 33:13.460
<i>All right, fine! Let's do it.</i>

33:13.537 --> 33:15.596
<i>No, I didn't mean it! I'm sorry.</i>

33:16.406 --> 33:18.465
<i>Jack, I have to introduce you</i>

33:18.542 --> 33:21.306
<i>to Christian Léger de la Touffe,
European market.</i>

33:21.378 --> 33:23.312
<i>Christian, this is Le Jack.</i>

33:23.613 --> 33:26.844
<i>Bonjour. I've heard a lot about you.</i>

33:26.917 --> 33:30.114
<i>Jack, tell Christian
the whole story about Sinja.</i>

33:30.187 --> 33:32.621
Tell him all the great details. Go ahead.

33:32.689 --> 33:34.714
<i>Ecoutez. You're going to die.</i>

33:38.895 --> 33:41.261
Life is a journey.

33:44.234 --> 33:45.258
Life is a what?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.531
Life is a journey?

33:57.981 --> 33:59.380
<i>Can you repeat that, please?</i>

34:02.419 --> 34:04.546
Life is a journey.

34:05.355 --> 34:07.050
"Life is a journey. "

34:07.457 --> 34:09.789
<i>Life is a journey, yeah.</i>

34:09.860 --> 34:10.849
I don't get it.

34:29.913 --> 34:31.744
You like to party on us.

34:51.268 --> 34:53.031
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.

34:54.971 --> 34:56.563
Jack McCall.

34:57.139 --> 35:00.769
<i>Yes, Mr. McCall, your party
is waiting for you. Right this way.</i>

35:00.844 --> 35:02.175
You want me to do all the talking?

35:02.245 --> 35:05.237
<i>No, no, no, I can't,
I don't know what to say.</i>

35:05.315 --> 35:07.112
Just do what you would do?
Is that good?

35:07.184 --> 35:09.152
<i>Wait, wait, wait, okay. Let's have signs,</i>

35:09.219 --> 35:12.655
<i>like if I'm doing well,
you pull on your ear. Okay?</i>

35:14.057 --> 35:17.493
<i>And then that can mean
that I need to do better. That's fine, too.</i>

35:20.764 --> 35:22.664
We were starting to think
you stood us up.

35:22.732 --> 35:24.996
<i>Robert Gilmore, VP of Acquisitions.</i>

35:25.068 --> 35:28.629
<i>This is Gil Reed, head of Marketing
at Simon and Schuster.</i>

35:30.707 --> 35:33.141
<i>Handshake.
Come on, man, we are brothers!</i>

35:33.210 --> 35:34.438
<i>Hit me hard and high, Gil.</i>

35:35.078 --> 35:36.238
Bam! That's right.

35:36.713 --> 35:38.681
<i>Aaron Wiseberger,
agent, friend of mankind</i>

35:38.748 --> 35:41.444
and a lover of every book
you guys have ever published.

35:41.518 --> 35:42.951
<i>Come on, what is this, Mickey D's?</i>

35:43.019 --> 35:44.748
Let's get some service up in here!

35:44.821 --> 35:46.789
Got a man
with a bad case of the dry mouth!

35:47.858 --> 35:49.325
<i>Why don't you sit your ass down,
come on.</i>

35:52.929 --> 35:55.159
<i>Good afternoon,
can I get you something to drink?</i>

35:55.265 --> 35:57.927
<i>How about the distillery
to start off with, huh?</i>

35:58.001 --> 35:59.161
<i>Vodka, rocks for me.</i>

35:59.236 --> 36:01.932
<i>Four waters for the table,
and this fine guy right here,</i>

36:02.005 --> 36:03.597
is gonna have a hot toddy.
His voice is shot.

36:03.673 --> 36:04.662
But you know what?

36:04.741 --> 36:07.301
That's what he gets for screaming
for more lap dances all night!

36:07.377 --> 36:09.311
You crazy bastard.

36:10.046 --> 36:13.379
<i>I have four waters,
vodka rocks, hot toddy.</i>

36:13.483 --> 36:14.677
My man.

36:26.663 --> 36:29.291
<i>Gentlemen, we don't
want to play games on this one.</i>

36:29.432 --> 36:30.763
<i>Good, games are for children.</i>

36:30.834 --> 36:32.995
The statistics speak for themselves.

36:33.069 --> 36:35.537
Dr. Sinja has a huge fan base
around the world.

36:35.605 --> 36:38.005
We want to be the company
to broaden that fan base here.

36:38.074 --> 36:39.803
We think we have a great offer.

36:39.876 --> 36:42.811
<i>A $250,000 advance</i>

36:43.613 --> 36:45.205
That sounds great.

36:47.484 --> 36:50.476
<i>All right, I'ma need y'all to quit playing
with me and pull out your big guns</i>

36:50.820 --> 36:53.755
<i>because this is
"Show Me Your Dick" time, fellas!</i>

36:55.325 --> 36:57.259
<i>Damn, Jack, look at you,
sweating like a bitch.</i>

36:57.327 --> 37:00.228
<i>Just chill out, homey.
I got this. Gil, come here.</i>

37:00.297 --> 37:02.390
<i>Gil, what I need from... Stay with me.</i>

37:02.465 --> 37:04.433
What I need from you
is to bring that paper.

37:04.501 --> 37:05.695
<i>You know, you got to turn the volume up</i>

37:05.769 --> 37:07.293
<i>on that offer, homey,
'cause I can't hear it.</i>

37:07.671 --> 37:09.366
I'm a young man.
My ears are good. I can't hear it.

37:09.439 --> 37:11.600
We can't go higher
if we haven't even seen the book yet.

37:11.675 --> 37:13.506
That's what it sounds like.

37:13.577 --> 37:15.374
<i>Look, you can't expect us to bid higher</i>

37:15.512 --> 37:17.503
<i>when we haven't seen the book,
can you?</i>

37:17.581 --> 37:18.843
That's ridiculous.

37:18.915 --> 37:20.780
Do you know
who the hell you're talking to?

37:20.850 --> 37:23.751
<i>I'm Aaron Wiseberger!
You better recognize, son!</i>

37:23.820 --> 37:27.017
I find both your language
and demeanor insulting and intolerable.

37:27.090 --> 37:31.117
Simon and Schuster doesn't
do business with spineless jerks. Gil?

37:32.729 --> 37:34.094
<i>No, no, no, wait! Wait, gentlemen, wait.</i>

37:34.698 --> 37:36.825
<i>Listen, I'm sorry
if I offended you back there.</i>

37:36.900 --> 37:37.924
I was just doing my agent act.

37:38.235 --> 37:40.203
<i>You know?
I mean, I don't even have a real degree.</i>

37:40.737 --> 37:41.931
<i>I went to community college,</i>

37:42.005 --> 37:45.908
and that was only because my grandma
was sleeping with the dean.

37:45.977 --> 37:48.241
<i>Good luck, gentlemen. You'll need it.</i>

37:50.081 --> 37:54.108
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

37:54.619 --> 37:57.281
<i>Round and round, round and round</i>

37:57.488 --> 38:00.787
<i>The wheels on the bus
go round and round</i>

38:00.858 --> 38:02.849
<i>All through the town</i>

38:02.927 --> 38:03.916
<i>Wait a minute, Dads.</i>

38:05.329 --> 38:06.887
We have a lip syncher.

38:07.865 --> 38:09.093
Mouther.

38:10.001 --> 38:12.162
<i>Everyone needs to sing along, Dad.</i>

38:12.236 --> 38:14.830
<i>See, 'cause Tyler's
taking his cues from you, okay?</i>

38:15.339 --> 38:17.739
He really needs you to sing along.

38:18.676 --> 38:20.906
<i>The wipers on the bus go...</i>

38:26.250 --> 38:27.342
<i>Swish...</i>

38:30.154 --> 38:32.486
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

38:32.857 --> 38:34.449
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

38:35.326 --> 38:37.021
<i>Swish, swish, swish</i>

38:37.094 --> 38:40.791
<i>The wipers on the bus
go swish, swish, swish</i>

38:40.865 --> 38:43.857
<i>All through the town</i>

38:46.737 --> 38:48.329
<i>Okay, Tyler,
are you ready to go to the moon?</i>

38:50.207 --> 38:51.936
Here we go!

38:59.483 --> 39:01.178
He's finally down.

39:03.821 --> 39:04.913
Can we talk?

39:07.425 --> 39:10.087
It's kind of funny
how you got singled out in that class

39:10.161 --> 39:12.186
<i>for not knowing the words, right?</i>

39:12.263 --> 39:15.824
<i>I mean, Jack McCall
not knowing the words?</i>

39:15.900 --> 39:16.889
That's a rarity.

39:18.936 --> 39:21.530
<i>It was really sweet, Jack.</i>

39:21.605 --> 39:24.768
It makes me very happy
to see the two of you in that circle.

39:28.179 --> 39:32.013
I think it's really important
that you guys have at least one thing

39:32.083 --> 39:33.573
<i>that you do together, you know?</i>

39:34.352 --> 39:37.651
<i>So, they offer it twice a week.</i>

39:37.722 --> 39:41.055
<i>Which day would you prefer,
Tuesday or Wednesday?</i>

39:42.493 --> 39:43.653
Can't.

39:44.061 --> 39:45.119
You can't.

39:46.464 --> 39:49.399
You can't take one hour
out of your week

39:49.467 --> 39:52.459
to be with your son? I don't understand.

40:00.311 --> 40:03.712
<i>What, the pool? The view? Wow.</i>

40:03.781 --> 40:05.840
I am trying to talk to you about our child

40:06.016 --> 40:07.381
and you want to fight
about the house again?

40:07.752 --> 40:11.449
<i>Look, honey, could you just try
for a second to talk to me about Tyler?</i>

40:11.522 --> 40:14.252
Just be here with me right now. What...

40:24.535 --> 40:26.935
<i>Apparently not.
Okay, that's good to know.</i>

40:27.171 --> 40:28.502
Sorry!

40:28.639 --> 40:29.663
Sorry?

40:30.074 --> 40:32.975
I'll let your son know that you're "sorry. "

40:39.917 --> 40:41.111
My life.

40:41.185 --> 40:42.675
<i>It's our life, Jack.</i>

40:43.888 --> 40:46.789
<i>I know that when we fell in love,
it was a whirlwind romance</i>

40:46.857 --> 40:49.348
<i>and then it seems like
I brought up the idea of having a baby,</i>

40:49.427 --> 40:51.588
<i>and, like, overnight we were pregnant.</i>

40:52.663 --> 40:55.393
But that's just how
life works sometimes.

40:56.167 --> 40:59.898
<i>Have you ever heard the expression,
"Man plans, God laughs"?</i>

41:02.039 --> 41:03.529
Two days.

41:03.607 --> 41:05.871
Two? Two days till what?

41:06.877 --> 41:09.209
<i>Jack, what? To what?</i>

41:09.680 --> 41:11.739
<i>Honey, you got to talk to me!</i>

41:11.816 --> 41:13.443
What? You're like a mental patient

41:13.617 --> 41:16.211
with the pointing
and the grunting. What?

41:21.592 --> 41:23.150
All of my talking is making you sick.

41:23.627 --> 41:24.651
That's great. You know what?

41:24.895 --> 41:27.557
I won't talk anymore.
How about that? You don't want to talk?

41:27.631 --> 41:28.996
<i>I don't want to talk, either.</i>

41:47.051 --> 41:49.519
<i>Welcome to the international directory.</i>

41:49.587 --> 41:52.078
<i>Are you looking for a country code?</i>

41:53.123 --> 41:54.556
<i>Are you still there?</i>

41:54.758 --> 41:55.782
Yes!

41:56.427 --> 41:59.191
<i>What country
would you like the code for?</i>

41:59.263 --> 42:00.560
Bolivia.

42:01.031 --> 42:03.693
<i>I'm sorry. I couldn't make that out.</i>

42:03.767 --> 42:04.995
Bolivia.

42:05.636 --> 42:07.661
<i>Namibia. Is that correct?</i>

42:07.738 --> 42:09.433
<i>No, stupid!</i>

42:09.507 --> 42:12.203
<i>Let me connect you
to the next available...</i>

42:12.276 --> 42:13.834
<i>International directory.</i>

42:13.911 --> 42:15.776
<i>Country code, Bolivia.</i>

42:16.647 --> 42:20.811
<i>City, Potosí. Business listing, La Paz.</i>

42:25.489 --> 42:26.649
Sinja!

42:29.159 --> 42:30.148
Yes!

42:31.028 --> 42:34.020
<i>Hello? This is Dr. Sinja. Who's calling?</i>

42:36.133 --> 42:37.623
<i>Who's calling?</i>

42:38.235 --> 42:39.600
Jack McCall!

42:39.670 --> 42:43.504
<i>Jack! Yes, well,
you're calling for an update, yes?</i>

42:46.510 --> 42:51.311
<i>I'm sorry, Jack, I forgot.
Trying to save our words, right?</i>

42:51.382 --> 42:54.647
<i>Just make an animal noise
if I'm correct.</i>

42:57.221 --> 42:59.485
<i>Good. Well, I have nothing yet,</i>

42:59.557 --> 43:04.051
<i>but I return tomorrow
and I shall call you as soon as I land.</i>

43:04.128 --> 43:05.459
<i>Bye, Jack!</i>

43:07.865 --> 43:08.854
Dickhead!

43:11.435 --> 43:12.697
"Dickhead" is one word!

43:15.105 --> 43:17.665
You are messing with the wrong guy!

43:19.043 --> 43:22.137
<i>What's up, my man? Can I get
something started for you today?</i>

43:29.454 --> 43:31.684
Sure. Venti triple-shot latte.

43:34.593 --> 43:36.788
Venti triple-shot iced latte.

43:39.598 --> 43:40.963
Extra milk?

43:42.801 --> 43:46.168
Jack! What the hell happened
at lunch yesterday?

43:46.237 --> 43:48.797
I got a call from Simon and Schuster.
They're pulling out of the deal.

43:48.873 --> 43:51.364
<i>They said some twerp junior agent
came to the meeting with you,</i>

43:51.443 --> 43:54.105
<i>that he was rude, uncouth and stupid!</i>

43:54.179 --> 43:56.170
<i>Now I have teed up
Random House perfectly here,</i>

43:56.247 --> 43:58.841
<i>so don't screw this up, too.
These guys are ready to pay.</i>

43:58.917 --> 44:01.351
Just keep it down
to business and it's a done deal.

44:01.419 --> 44:02.443
Miss Davis?

44:02.520 --> 44:04.454
I've got Mr. Parker
from Random House on the line.

44:04.522 --> 44:06.854
<i>Okay, here we go.
It's a no-brainer, Jack.</i>

44:06.925 --> 44:09.086
A deaf mute could close this deal.

44:09.327 --> 44:10.794
I'm late for a meeting.
Call me when you're done?

44:12.063 --> 44:14.190
You promise you're gonna call me?

44:14.366 --> 44:16.334
<i>Don't let me down, Jack.</i>

44:25.910 --> 44:26.968
<i>Jack!</i>

44:27.245 --> 44:31.181
<i>Don Parker.
I got Sarah Elliot, Rick Panero with us.</i>

44:32.417 --> 44:34.385
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

44:34.452 --> 44:36.716
<i>Hello? Jack, are you there?</i>

44:36.821 --> 44:37.981
Hello?

44:39.257 --> 44:40.485
Good.

44:40.625 --> 44:43.788
<i>Hey, I guess Samantha
told you we were interested.</i>

44:44.996 --> 44:46.054
<i>Great.</i>

44:46.464 --> 44:48.694
So what do you say we make a deal?

44:51.002 --> 44:52.026
<i>Jack?</i>

44:52.103 --> 44:53.536
Hello? You want to get started or no?

44:55.874 --> 44:57.000
<i>Good. Okay, listen.</i>

44:57.075 --> 44:59.270
<i>Let's skip the formalities,
get right down to specifics.</i>

44:59.344 --> 45:00.368
<i>We talked internally.</i>

45:00.445 --> 45:03.903
<i>We thought
a realistic offer would be 250.</i>

45:03.982 --> 45:05.574
<i>What do you say?</i>

45:07.786 --> 45:09.310
<i>What if I bumped it up to 275?</i>

45:09.754 --> 45:11.688
<i>You really need to consider the 275.</i>

45:11.756 --> 45:12.984
<i>Why don't you run it by your people?</i>

45:13.258 --> 45:14.282
We'll wait.

45:20.665 --> 45:21.723
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

45:23.968 --> 45:25.697
<i>Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

45:29.374 --> 45:31.342
I just need to borrow this for a minute.
I'll explain later.

45:31.409 --> 45:32.899
I need to borrow this. It's for Jack.

45:32.977 --> 45:34.410
<i>Rachel, I think
there's some real secret shit</i>

45:34.479 --> 45:37.312
that I'm gonna start telling everybody
if you don't give me the damn doll!

45:40.318 --> 45:42.115
So what's the verdict on the 275?

45:42.187 --> 45:43.677
<i>Are you in, are you out?</i>

45:46.458 --> 45:48.016
<i>We haven't even seen the book.</i>

45:48.259 --> 45:50.557
What's the problem? You don't trust
our publicity department?

45:53.198 --> 45:55.257
<i>You're damn right they are!
So what's the hang up?</i>

45:57.669 --> 46:00.035
<i>Hey, you gonna start throwing insults?</i>

46:00.105 --> 46:02.596
<i>Listen, if that's the way
you're gonna handle this,</i>

46:02.674 --> 46:05.142
we'll just call the whole deal off.
Check the attitude.

46:07.078 --> 46:09.512
<i>All right, Jack, look.
Just throw me a bone here.</i>

46:09.581 --> 46:11.242
What if I bumped it up to 300?

46:18.690 --> 46:21.215
Fine! I give up! Five hundred!

46:21.593 --> 46:23.458
<i>If I get 500 approved,</i>

46:23.528 --> 46:24.517
are we closed?

46:27.165 --> 46:29.998
<i>You are gonna owe me
so big next time, mister.</i>

46:32.504 --> 46:36.600
<i>Tyler is teething, poor thing,
and it's terrible, you know,</i>

46:36.674 --> 46:39.108
<i>because he's not sleeping,
I'm not sleeping.</i>

46:39.177 --> 46:40.940
Jack's not getting any ass?

46:41.312 --> 46:42.677
Can you...

46:42.747 --> 46:44.806
He won't even baby-proof the kitchen.

46:44.883 --> 46:46.578
Why in the world
would I give him some?

46:46.651 --> 46:47.811
Are you wearing
granny panties right now?

46:47.886 --> 46:48.910
Excuse me?

46:48.987 --> 46:51.547
Are you wearing
granny panties right now?

46:51.723 --> 46:53.054
And a nursing bra?

46:53.124 --> 46:54.591
I am not answering that.

46:54.659 --> 46:56.320
You don't have to.

46:57.462 --> 46:59.293
I am doing the best I can.

46:59.597 --> 47:00.859
I have a present for you.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.189
What is that?

47:04.068 --> 47:06.502
Do not judge me by what's in this bag.

47:12.277 --> 47:13.266
No.

47:13.344 --> 47:17.007
<i>No, I cannot do this.</i>

47:17.482 --> 47:18.471
Why not?

47:18.550 --> 47:21.144
Because I am not that kind of girl.

47:21.219 --> 47:23.346
That's why they make tequila.

47:23.788 --> 47:26.222
Tequila plus ass equals happiness.

47:34.032 --> 47:35.158
<i>How can I help you, sir?</i>

47:40.271 --> 47:41.260
Meeting someone.

47:43.074 --> 47:45.269
I was told you'd be punctual.

48:07.031 --> 48:11.058
<i>My! You're a wee slip of a thing,
aren't you? But all right.</i>

48:12.904 --> 48:14.303
Climb aboard.

48:17.375 --> 48:19.138
I'm so sorry about the mix-up.

48:19.344 --> 48:21.869
Caroline McCall's in room 413.

48:35.093 --> 48:37.186
You looking for someone?

48:44.736 --> 48:47.500
<i>I've been thinking about you all day,</i>

48:50.475 --> 48:53.342
about all the things I want to do

48:54.879 --> 48:56.369
to you.

48:57.649 --> 48:59.139
Let me help you.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.181
Now why don't you

49:04.856 --> 49:07.222
tell me what you want.

49:08.626 --> 49:10.856
Tell me all the little

49:11.262 --> 49:15.097
naughty things
you want me to do to you.

49:17.569 --> 49:19.537
Bow-chik-a-bow-wow.

49:23.876 --> 49:26.572
<i>Don't be scared, babe.
Just spicing things up a bit.</i>

49:28.447 --> 49:30.381
<i>Here's how it's gonna work, baby.</i>

49:30.449 --> 49:34.044
<i>The more you say, the more I do.</i>

49:36.121 --> 49:39.113
So tell me what you want. Come on.

49:39.291 --> 49:40.849
<i>Talk dirty to me, Jack.</i>

49:42.995 --> 49:44.189
Don't you want me?

49:44.897 --> 49:45.886
Yeah?

49:46.532 --> 49:48.159
<i>Come on, then say it.</i>

49:48.233 --> 49:50.531
Tell me what you want me to do.

49:51.904 --> 49:54.065
<i>Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.</i>

49:54.139 --> 49:55.766
<i>Come on, Jack.</i>

49:56.342 --> 49:57.866
<i>Come on, you can do it, that's right.</i>

49:57.943 --> 49:59.035
<i>That's right, Jack, come on.</i>

49:59.278 --> 50:00.939
<i>Come on, Jack, Jack.</i>

50:01.280 --> 50:02.747
<i>Talk dirty to me, Jack!</i>

50:05.784 --> 50:07.877
I don't know what I was thinking.

50:08.620 --> 50:11.783
<i>Honey, I just wanted to try
to prove to you</i>

50:11.857 --> 50:13.188
that we could still have fun.

50:13.492 --> 50:15.153
But I guess we can't.

50:15.227 --> 50:18.355
<i>So, I'm so embarrassed.</i>

50:18.430 --> 50:20.921
<i>Okay, Jack, this isn't working.</i>

50:25.137 --> 50:28.538
We don't...
We're not what we used to be.

50:28.607 --> 50:30.302
<i>I mean, not since Tyler was born.</i>

50:30.376 --> 50:32.003
It's just different.

50:32.077 --> 50:34.671
It's like we've forgotten
how to talk to each other.

50:34.747 --> 50:35.941
<i>I mean, don't you think it's different?</i>

50:37.883 --> 50:39.817
<i>Jack, I don't even know
if you love me anymore.</i>

50:39.885 --> 50:42.115
Are you still in love with me?

50:45.124 --> 50:47.058
<i>Okay, well, then, you have to say that,</i>

50:47.126 --> 50:49.026
<i>you have to tell me that, okay?</i>

50:49.094 --> 50:50.459
I want to hear you say it.

50:51.497 --> 50:52.862
I love you.

50:54.166 --> 50:57.499
<i>No, Jack, please,
I need to hear it. Okay?</i>

50:57.569 --> 51:02.563
<i>I need you to say, "Caroline,
I love you, and I want to be with you.</i>

51:02.641 --> 51:06.975
"I want to spend the rest
of my life with you and never let you go. "

51:07.046 --> 51:09.014
Can you please say that?

51:11.517 --> 51:13.246
Can you say that?

51:14.853 --> 51:15.842
Yes!

51:21.627 --> 51:22.685
But that's it.

51:23.629 --> 51:24.960
Okay.

51:25.030 --> 51:30.058
<i>Okay, so I think that
we should see a professional,</i>

51:30.135 --> 51:32.467
<i>somebody that we can sit down
and talk to,</i>

51:32.538 --> 51:35.803
and they can help us
figure out how to end all this.

51:38.877 --> 51:39.969
What?

51:49.388 --> 51:50.980
There's a tree.

51:52.591 --> 51:54.320
Losing leaves. Strength.

51:55.627 --> 51:58.790
<i>When I talk, leaves go.</i>

52:00.466 --> 52:02.195
<i>And when leaves go,</i>

52:04.503 --> 52:06.368
I die.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.831
That's what this is about?

52:10.843 --> 52:13.107
Some midlife crisis bullshit?

52:13.912 --> 52:16.506
<i>You're here to tell me this poem
about your leaves falling,</i>

52:16.582 --> 52:18.550
<i>like if you somehow
communicate with me,</i>

52:18.617 --> 52:20.084
you're gonna be less of a man?

52:20.152 --> 52:22.814
<i>Jack, get out.</i>

52:24.189 --> 52:25.679
<i>No, really.</i>

52:25.858 --> 52:27.018
Go.

52:27.993 --> 52:30.086
<i>I want to be alone, please.</i>

52:34.600 --> 52:36.727
<i>Jack, now.</i>

53:13.071 --> 53:15.938
<i>Jack! Hey, Sam is at lunch right now</i>

53:16.008 --> 53:18.977
<i>closing your deal
with Random House and don't kill me,</i>

53:19.044 --> 53:20.841
but I stepped away from my desk

53:20.913 --> 53:23.211
and somebody
sent a copy of Sinja's book over.

53:25.951 --> 53:26.940
Are you mad?

53:33.825 --> 53:34.814
<i>Oh, look who it is!</i>

53:35.327 --> 53:36.589
<i>- Hey, Jack.
- Hi, Jack.</i>

53:36.995 --> 53:39.122
<i>What is this, casual Fridays?</i>

53:39.198 --> 53:40.290
<i>Okay, look, we got to lock this up,</i>

53:40.365 --> 53:42.890
get them excited and signing
before they change their minds.

53:42.968 --> 53:45.061
Did you bring the book?

53:45.137 --> 53:47.628
<i>It's okay. Mary's bringing a copy later.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

53:50.242 --> 53:54.008
<i>You breathe that stuff in and, boom,
it make you loco!</i>

53:54.713 --> 53:56.146
Now we're all here.

53:59.218 --> 54:00.583
<i>All right, let me catch you up to speed.</i>

54:00.652 --> 54:03.780
We're talking about
marketing and rollout strategies.

54:04.389 --> 54:05.822
Marketing and rollout strategies.

54:07.993 --> 54:10.894
I think we should all be thinking globally.

54:12.698 --> 54:14.063
Boom!

54:14.800 --> 54:18.964
<i>I was gonna clean my room
Until I got high</i>

54:21.340 --> 54:23.069
<i>Are you okay, Jack?</i>

54:25.010 --> 54:25.999
Jack?

54:27.879 --> 54:30.245
Can I get you some water? All right.

54:30.315 --> 54:32.010
<i>Sir, may I bring you something to eat?</i>

54:32.217 --> 54:34.879
Maybe you'd like to start
with a lovely salad.

54:43.595 --> 54:44.857
<i>He'll just have water, thank you.</i>

54:45.297 --> 54:46.286
Thank you very much.

54:48.066 --> 54:51.263
<i>Yes, it's getting us all quite giddy,
the whole idea of it.</i>

54:51.336 --> 54:53.600
<i>So, I think, as far as television goes,</i>

54:53.672 --> 54:55.435
we want a full-scale media blitz.

54:55.508 --> 54:57.738
<i>Morning shows, late night,
all the talk shows.</i>

54:58.978 --> 55:00.002
<i>With a book like this,</i>

55:00.079 --> 55:04.209
<i>we can target discount stores,
club chains, coffee shops.</i>

55:04.350 --> 55:06.648
I also think
we should look at product tie-ins.

55:07.253 --> 55:12.748
Like Sinja's diets or workout tapes.

55:12.825 --> 55:14.793
Good idea.

55:14.861 --> 55:17.796
<i>I've prepared contracts, which you'll find
at the back of your packets.</i>

55:18.531 --> 55:20.328
You'll notice
that the price has gone up slightly

55:20.400 --> 55:24.336
and that's to reflect the author's
marketing commitments to this project.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.338
<i>No, thank you, Jack. I'm on Atkins.</i>

55:27.040 --> 55:28.974
But I really don't see any reason
why we shouldn't go ahead

55:29.142 --> 55:30.370
and sign this right now

55:30.443 --> 55:34.140
so we can all move forward together
as one professional team.

55:36.883 --> 55:38.111
Jack!

55:38.184 --> 55:40.243
<i>Yeah, I could have just emailed this
to you.</i>

55:41.321 --> 55:42.720
The book is just five pages.

55:44.490 --> 55:47.216
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

55:48.995 --> 55:50.792
<i>Ira, I'm sure this is all
some sort of misunderstanding.</i>

55:50.863 --> 55:53.093
- Samantha.
- We'll be in touch.

55:55.368 --> 55:57.802
Jack! What the hell is wrong with you?

55:58.237 --> 56:01.502
Acting like
a drunk 3-year-old at the table?

56:01.574 --> 56:04.873
Not telling me
that Sinja's book is five pages long?

56:06.879 --> 56:08.744
Don't you have anything at all to say
about this?

56:15.988 --> 56:18.684
<i>Jack, you're fired.</i>

56:23.496 --> 56:25.487
<i>Okay, okay, please calm down.</i>

56:25.565 --> 56:27.692
<i>I need you to relax, Mr. McCall.</i>

56:27.767 --> 56:29.701
'Cause I'm here
to help you get your job back.

56:29.769 --> 56:31.031
I am and we're gonna do it.

56:31.371 --> 56:33.168
<i>But right now, I'm just really concerned</i>

56:33.306 --> 56:35.706
about that vein in your neck exploding.

56:35.875 --> 56:39.572
<i>I'm going to get it this time, I promise.
I promise. Here we go.</i>

56:41.681 --> 56:42.739
<i>Okay, you.</i>

56:43.516 --> 56:45.108
<i>Yes, that's you.</i>

56:45.485 --> 56:46.645
You...

56:47.320 --> 56:48.446
You're talking... You talk?

56:48.788 --> 56:52.519
<i>Okay, we've established that.
And it's snowing.</i>

56:53.025 --> 56:54.617
<i>No? Okay. Okay, yeah.</i>

56:54.694 --> 56:55.786
Obviously not snowing.

56:57.063 --> 56:58.052
The leaves.

56:58.698 --> 57:00.757
The leaves fall...
The leaves fall off the tree.

57:01.334 --> 57:02.699
Okay. Okay.

57:05.838 --> 57:07.635
<i>When you talk,
all the leaves fall off the tree.</i>

57:09.108 --> 57:11.872
<i>Okay, this is fun.
It's not fun. I didn't mean it like that.</i>

57:13.045 --> 57:15.946
<i>And when all the leaves fall off the tree,</i>

57:16.749 --> 57:17.738
you are asleep.

57:18.684 --> 57:20.675
Okay. You're not asleep.

57:22.555 --> 57:24.455
You're illegal. You're a stop sign?

57:24.757 --> 57:26.782
<i>Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

57:27.927 --> 57:29.554
You're vogueing?

57:29.629 --> 57:30.789
You...

57:33.599 --> 57:34.861
<i>When all the leaves fall off, you die!</i>

57:38.905 --> 57:40.270
<i>Oh, listen, I get it.</i>

57:40.807 --> 57:43.298
I get it. I once took acid in college

57:43.376 --> 57:45.867
and I thought for sure
that my hair had a heartbeat.

57:47.580 --> 57:49.047
But it didn't!

57:55.388 --> 57:56.377
Okay.

58:00.126 --> 58:01.115
Pancake.

58:03.996 --> 58:04.985
It's a coincidence.

58:05.064 --> 58:06.656
<i>It's not a coincidence, you idiot!</i>

58:06.732 --> 58:08.131
<i>Look, you just lost five more!</i>

58:09.368 --> 58:11.734
I'm sorry. Can I be really honest here?

58:11.804 --> 58:13.271
I think I know why Samantha fired you.

58:14.106 --> 58:16.506
'Cause this is very crazy.
This is like Britney territory.

58:20.680 --> 58:23.740
<i>Okay, well said,
Mr. McCall, but I'm gonna go.</i>

58:23.816 --> 58:26.444
<i>No, it's cool, we're cool. We're cool.</i>

58:31.357 --> 58:34.349
Stay? You want me
to keep an eye on the leaves?

58:35.394 --> 58:36.554
Okay.

58:37.029 --> 58:38.360
Never thought I'd miss
the marshmallows.

58:38.431 --> 58:40.490
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

58:41.100 --> 58:42.328
To pray?

58:44.270 --> 58:45.294
To be an angel?

58:45.805 --> 58:48.205
<i>Okay, got it. Good luck!</i>

58:53.446 --> 58:54.504
Pancake.

59:05.191 --> 59:07.091
How about now?

59:07.159 --> 59:08.421
Falling as we speak.

59:12.331 --> 59:13.491
Hello.

59:15.468 --> 59:17.060
Thank you. God bless you.

59:17.737 --> 59:19.204
<i>Oh, my God, all the leaves just fell off.</i>

59:19.539 --> 59:20.528
What?

59:20.673 --> 59:22.231
<i>No, I'm kidding.</i>

59:28.648 --> 59:29.706
God bless you.

59:29.949 --> 59:31.541
Hallelujah. Now what?

59:32.885 --> 59:33.977
Nope.

59:39.425 --> 59:41.393
<i>Mittens! Mittens, come down!</i>

59:42.061 --> 59:43.050
<i>Come down, Mittens.</i>

59:56.075 --> 59:57.064
Falling?

59:58.544 --> 01:00:00.171
<i>Yeah, they are.</i>

01:00:00.246 --> 01:00:02.771
<i>And, Jack, Samantha's office called.
They want me back.</i>

01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.312
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:10.209
<i>Jackie, dinner time!</i>

01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.686
<i>Here you go, sweetie pie.</i>

01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:22.625
<i>- Voilà!
- I knew it was gonna be ham</i>

01:01:22.696 --> 01:01:23.890
and mashed potatoes!

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.790
<i>Mom, may I pick my piece first?</i>

01:01:26.867 --> 01:01:29.961
<i>You may,
because you asked so politely.</i>

01:01:30.037 --> 01:01:31.334
Thank you.

01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:34.106
There you go.

01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:38.036
<i>Shake it, don't break it, Jackie!</i>

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.909
<i>Hey, remember
the "I Love Ham" dance? Do that dance.</i>

01:01:41.882 --> 01:01:43.076
Jackie.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.818
<i>Jackie, it's me. I mean, I'm you!</i>

01:01:45.886 --> 01:01:49.515
<i>Hey, Jackie, we're here!
I'm us! Jackie, I'm here!</i>

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:51.318
<i>No, Dad, you're not here.</i>

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.923
You were never here. You left.

01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:57.228
I'm not Dad.

01:02:19.686 --> 01:02:21.449
Pie. What a concept.

01:02:22.456 --> 01:02:25.391
<i>You can't get pie in Bolivia,
not like pie in America.</i>

01:02:25.459 --> 01:02:27.256
<i>Fruit pies, cream pies...</i>

01:02:31.064 --> 01:02:32.224
Sorry.

01:02:34.367 --> 01:02:35.493
It's quite amazing

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:37.594
how many thoughtless words
one can speak.

01:02:38.105 --> 01:02:39.697
Don't you think?

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.565
<i>You don't look well, Jack.</i>

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:51.679
Your marriage is over?

01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:57.248
She took the baby and left.

01:03:04.765 --> 01:03:05.993
<i>Your job, too?</i>

01:03:08.068 --> 01:03:09.467
<i>Sorry, Jack.</i>

01:03:10.804 --> 01:03:15.207
<i>All I have for you are my beliefs,
and, well,</i>

01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:20.779
this snow globe from the airport.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.708
You unhook me
from this goddamned tree!

01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:26.878
<i>- Please, Jack.
- I'm dying!</i>

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.587
I know you're scared.

01:03:32.626 --> 01:03:35.925
And I know I told you
I'd come back with the answer.

01:03:37.497 --> 01:03:39.226
<i>Well, the answer is</i>

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.994
there is no answer.

01:03:42.202 --> 01:03:43.931
<i>No one knows about this tree, Jack,</i>

01:03:44.004 --> 01:03:46.837
<i>and believe me, I tried. Okay?</i>

01:03:48.608 --> 01:03:52.135
<i>I don't know
how this is going to work out for you,</i>

01:03:52.212 --> 01:03:55.238
but what I do know
is that you need to find peace.

01:04:00.887 --> 01:04:03.879
<i>If you think I'm a charlatan,
then why are you here?</i>

01:04:05.158 --> 01:04:06.625
You want my advice?

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.255
You need to find the truth
about yourself.

01:04:14.868 --> 01:04:17.735
<i>It's quite simple, Jack.
You need to get quiet.</i>

01:04:17.804 --> 01:04:21.638
<i>Not just with your mouth,
with your mind.</i>

01:04:21.708 --> 01:04:25.200
<i>And in that quiet, you will hear the truth.</i>

01:04:29.249 --> 01:04:33.151
Do you have any other
unresolved relationships in your life?

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.548
Good.

01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:39.684
Good.

01:04:40.994 --> 01:04:45.397
<i>Then your wife,
does she know that you love her?</i>

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:46.830
I tell her that all the time!

01:04:48.869 --> 01:04:51.599
<i>Words? More words, Jack.</i>

01:04:52.239 --> 01:04:57.006
<i>You tell her, like meaningless leaves
that fly off a dying tree?</i>

01:04:58.945 --> 01:05:00.105
Words.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.640
Can't you show her that you love her?

01:05:07.554 --> 01:05:11.183
Make peace.
Show them that you love them.

01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:13.959
And be truthful.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:19.828
You need to accept the possibility

01:05:21.234 --> 01:05:24.328
that when all the leaves
fall off that tree...

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.834
Mr. McCall?

01:06:02.342 --> 01:06:03.707
Mr. McCall?

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.810
<i>Hey! I've been calling and emailing,</i>

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:08.871
and I got great ideas
about how to save your job.

01:06:09.849 --> 01:06:11.714
Sinja's book can work.

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:14.382
<i>I know, I'm excited, too.</i>

01:06:14.454 --> 01:06:16.786
We've been thinking about it all wrong.

01:06:16.856 --> 01:06:19.188
<i>Mr. McCall, are you listening?</i>

01:06:19.259 --> 01:06:20.726
Are you okay?

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:27.261
What'd you do to yourself?

01:06:28.669 --> 01:06:30.534
You smell like my dad.

01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:37.974
You need some help? No? Okay.

01:06:43.684 --> 01:06:47.916
I'm not sure that getting drunk
is the best plan of attack right now.

01:06:49.156 --> 01:06:50.214
You.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.557
It's all your fault!

01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:57.960
<i>Oh, yeah, how do you like that?</i>

01:06:59.367 --> 01:07:00.561
Cheers!

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.102
Freaking weed!

01:07:10.177 --> 01:07:12.042
<i>Mr. McCall, stop talking. Come on.</i>

01:07:12.113 --> 01:07:13.637
<i>You know, fertilizer is crap!</i>

01:07:13.714 --> 01:07:15.306
<i>That means that technically,
you eat shit!</i>

01:07:15.383 --> 01:07:16.577
<i>Stop talking, you idiot!</i>

01:07:17.418 --> 01:07:18.749
Just stop!

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.124
That's it.

01:07:28.229 --> 01:07:29.321
What?

01:07:31.165 --> 01:07:32.189
What are you doing?

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:44.072
I'm ending it. And I'm ending it funky!

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:49.471
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

01:07:50.751 --> 01:07:51.740
It's a hot beat.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:54.287
That's the shit. That's Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes.

01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:58.155
<i>Featuring Teddy Pendergrass!
Sing that shit, Teddy!</i>

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:01.585
<i>Bad luck
That's what you got</i>

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:03.186
<i>Jack, stop talking.</i>

01:08:03.264 --> 01:08:05.698
<i>Bad luck sure 'nuff got a hold on you</i>

01:08:05.766 --> 01:08:06.755
<i>Jack, what are you doing?</i>

01:08:07.902 --> 01:08:09.164
Done lost your woman.

01:08:09.537 --> 01:08:10.799
<i>- I lost my woman.
- Jack, shut up!</i>

01:08:10.871 --> 01:08:13.806
You know what that means now?
Not a goddamned thing!

01:08:13.874 --> 01:08:14.898
<i>Jack, what are you doing? Stop talking.</i>

01:08:14.975 --> 01:08:16.908
What does it matter?
Look at my family. Look at my people.

01:08:16.977 --> 01:08:18.841
- Jack!
- Look at my people! It's beautiful.

01:08:18.912 --> 01:08:20.403
<i>This is beautiful, my family, huh?</i>

01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:21.675
You're killing yourself! Stop!

01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:22.943
- You know why?
- Stop!

01:08:23.017 --> 01:08:24.779
<i>'Cause I got bad luck</i>

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:25.944
Jack!

01:08:26.654 --> 01:08:27.881
Shut up!

01:08:28.721 --> 01:08:31.850
<i>You never think you got
Bad luck, bad luck</i>

01:08:31.926 --> 01:08:32.915
Stop talking!

01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:52.167
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

01:08:58.886 --> 01:08:59.875
Caroline.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:22.033
There's really nothing in college
that prepares you

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:24.134
to work in the real world.

01:10:54.835 --> 01:10:57.702
<i>Tree, can you hear me?</i>

01:10:59.139 --> 01:11:00.231
<i>Tree.</i>

01:11:02.142 --> 01:11:03.803
<i>We're dying, tree.</i>

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.573
<i>Please, tell me what to do.</i>

01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:10.377
<i>It's me.</i>

01:11:11.752 --> 01:11:13.652
<i>My name is Jack McCall.</i>

01:11:14.955 --> 01:11:16.217
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:19.748
<i>what you're listening to
is not the sound of my voice.</i>

01:11:19.827 --> 01:11:23.388
<i>It's the sound of my inner voice,
the one inside my head.</i>

01:11:33.507 --> 01:11:35.168
<i>Mr. McCall?</i>

01:11:35.509 --> 01:11:36.533
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:41.108
Can you hear me?
It's Emily from the nursing home.

01:11:41.915 --> 01:11:45.646
<i>It's your mom's birthday
and she expects Raymond to be here.</i>

01:11:45.853 --> 01:11:46.911
<i>Mr. McCall?</i>

01:12:37.172 --> 01:12:38.264
Look.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.064
<i>I know what you want,</i>

01:12:40.141 --> 01:12:42.541
<i>but I just don't think that there's anything
more to talk about, okay?</i>

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.168
Because you won't...

01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:50.208
You.

01:12:51.686 --> 01:12:52.710
Me.

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:56.614
We.

01:12:58.526 --> 01:12:59.788
Eternity.

01:13:21.716 --> 01:13:23.047
Is this for me?

01:13:24.686 --> 01:13:26.551
It's a Beatles record.

01:13:28.289 --> 01:13:29.950
<i>It's the White Album.</i>

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.056
It's an original first press!

01:13:34.696 --> 01:13:37.790
Is this really for me to keep?

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.724
Yes.

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:43.728
Thank you.

01:13:44.706 --> 01:13:45.866
Thank you.

01:13:57.819 --> 01:13:59.343
Go get his car.

01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:05.084
You actually read it?

01:14:06.261 --> 01:14:07.250
Brilliant.

01:14:10.165 --> 01:14:12.156
Brilliant? Really?

01:14:14.235 --> 01:14:15.293
Wow.

01:14:17.238 --> 01:14:18.227
Sold.

01:14:21.443 --> 01:14:22.501
Sold?

01:14:22.911 --> 01:14:26.438
<i>Sold? That's $10,000!</i>

01:14:26.514 --> 01:14:29.381
<i>That's $10,000! I love you, man.</i>

01:14:30.785 --> 01:14:32.275
Thank you.

01:14:37.025 --> 01:14:38.686
Yeah.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.320
<i>I'm gonna take care of that for you
right away, Mr. McCall.</i>

01:14:41.396 --> 01:14:43.023
<i>I'll gas it, too.</i>

01:14:48.102 --> 01:14:50.229
Who's responsible for this?

01:14:52.941 --> 01:14:55.774
<i>You are going to love that,
I guarantee it.</i>

01:14:56.478 --> 01:14:58.207
Yeah? Take a taste.

01:15:07.255 --> 01:15:08.313
I want to ride the roller coaster.

01:15:08.389 --> 01:15:09.413
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:10.480
I want to ride the roller coaster.

01:15:10.558 --> 01:15:11.547
I want to ride the Ferris wheel.

01:15:11.626 --> 01:15:15.820
- Roller coaster.
- Ferris wheel.

01:15:22.103 --> 01:15:25.368
<i>It's sunny, but it's windy. Should we go?</i>

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.930
You can wear my sweater.

01:15:27.008 --> 01:15:29.568
Is that why you wore a sweater
under your jacket?

01:15:29.644 --> 01:15:31.373
You knew I would say that.

01:15:32.514 --> 01:15:37.645
<i>After 42 years, you're still trying
to get me alone on the beach.</i>

01:15:37.719 --> 01:15:39.084
Maybe. Maybe.

01:16:13.688 --> 01:16:15.952
<i>Raymond, is that you?</i>

01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:19.056
<i>Raymond, is that you?</i>

01:16:20.395 --> 01:16:21.384
Yes.

01:16:24.399 --> 01:16:26.890
<i>Raymond, you finally came.</i>

01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:29.828
Sit!

01:16:31.606 --> 01:16:34.700
<i>Tell me, tell me, what you been doing?</i>

01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:37.437
It's my birthday.

01:16:38.046 --> 01:16:40.139
You want some birthday cake?

01:16:41.516 --> 01:16:42.608
What?

01:16:43.585 --> 01:16:45.348
You can't talk. Your throat.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:48.480
<i>Rest then, Raymond.
I have so much to tell you.</i>

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:51.021
Do you like my room?

01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:53.159
It's so nice.

01:16:55.096 --> 01:16:57.223
I've got all my things here.

01:16:58.533 --> 01:17:00.023
<i>But sometimes,</i>

01:17:01.502 --> 01:17:03.129
I get lonely.

01:17:03.871 --> 01:17:05.964
<i>Raymond, I get so...</i>

01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:13.272
<i>But then, I can always count on Jack.
Jack always comes.</i>

01:17:15.316 --> 01:17:20.117
<i>And he brings me flowers,
helps me, and when we go for walks,</i>

01:17:20.188 --> 01:17:24.181
all the ladies are jealous
because he's so handsome.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.551
<i>I'm just so proud of him, Raymond.</i>

01:17:29.297 --> 01:17:33.097
<i>See, you missed Jack
grow into the greatest man.</i>

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:36.068
<i>I mean, he's amazing.
He can do anything.</i>

01:17:36.137 --> 01:17:38.765
<i>I mean, Jack's my only reason to live.</i>

01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:43.641
But he's so angry.

01:17:44.812 --> 01:17:46.677
<i>Mad at you, mad at himself.</i>

01:17:46.748 --> 01:17:52.153
<i>Now, I think he believes
you left because of him.</i>

01:17:52.688 --> 01:17:58.285
<i>He was just a kid,
but he carries that anger every day.</i>

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.884
I wish he'd let it go.

01:18:00.596 --> 01:18:04.191
He'd be much happier if he'd let it all go.

01:18:07.469 --> 01:18:08.697
<i>Raymond,</i>

01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:13.574
you need to tell Jack

01:18:14.877 --> 01:18:16.742
how much you love him.

01:18:18.113 --> 01:18:19.273
We're family.

01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:21.946
Life's

01:18:23.585 --> 01:18:27.077
not worth living without family.

01:18:28.524 --> 01:18:29.513
Right?

01:18:32.995 --> 01:18:34.155
Right?

01:18:42.404 --> 01:18:44.838
Isn't someone going to sing to me?

01:18:49.344 --> 01:18:51.676
<i>I like cake, don't you, Jack?</i>

01:19:02.891 --> 01:19:05.257
<i>Bye, Ma. I love you.</i>

01:20:01.784 --> 01:20:03.513
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

01:20:05.387 --> 01:20:06.786
- Jack?
- Yeah.

01:20:08.056 --> 01:20:10.115
<i>I'm not Dad. I'm you.</i>

01:20:10.192 --> 01:20:12.023
<i>- I'm Jack, too, you know.
- Are not.</i>

01:20:12.094 --> 01:20:13.584
<i>- Am, too!
- Are not.</i>

01:20:14.396 --> 01:20:17.126
<i>I missed you, Dad.
Where have you been?</i>

01:20:17.199 --> 01:20:19.360
<i>You left and then I saw you a few times,</i>

01:20:20.102 --> 01:20:21.729
but then it was a long time.

01:20:22.137 --> 01:20:24.264
And then you died.

01:20:25.374 --> 01:20:27.137
<i>I'm so sorry, Jack.</i>

01:20:27.209 --> 01:20:29.439
<i>I guess you never know if the last time
you see someone</i>

01:20:30.045 --> 01:20:33.446
is going to be the last time
you ever see someone.

01:20:34.516 --> 01:20:36.711
<i>I wish there was a way
I could make it up to you.</i>

01:20:36.785 --> 01:20:37.774
<i>There is.</i>

01:20:39.021 --> 01:20:41.012
- How?
- Chase me. Come on!

01:21:04.513 --> 01:21:06.105
I forgive you.

01:22:07.843 --> 01:22:09.640
<i>Jack? Jack?</i>

01:22:11.113 --> 01:22:13.513
You're not going to believe this!

01:22:22.124 --> 01:22:26.151
<i>Jack, the tree, it came back to life
and it's incredible! You can talk.</i>

01:22:32.334 --> 01:22:37.135
<i>You've written a beautiful book, Jack.
I'm so proud of you.</i>

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.232
<i>You're hugging me again, Jack.
We spoke about this.</i>

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.609
That's why I'm alive! This is the real me!
That was a fake me that died.

01:22:45.847 --> 01:22:48.509
I just love you so much. Come here.

01:22:48.583 --> 01:22:50.244
- Hello!
- Hello.

01:22:52.421 --> 01:22:53.445
Friends.

01:22:54.623 --> 01:22:56.386
<i>Namaste.</i>

01:22:56.458 --> 01:22:57.618
<i>Welcome to my office,</i>

01:22:57.693 --> 01:23:01.322
the outer manifestation
of my inner being.

01:23:02.698 --> 01:23:03.960
You're both inside me.

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:11.728
What a beautiful book. What a gift

01:23:11.873 --> 01:23:15.365
<i>to hold, to read, to sell.</i>

01:23:19.514 --> 01:23:21.175
<i>- Hey, Aaron.
- Yes.</i>

01:23:21.717 --> 01:23:23.116
No chanting.

01:23:24.119 --> 01:23:26.451
<i>Of course. Forgive me, wise ones.</i>

01:23:27.756 --> 01:23:30.190
<i>All right, we got three offers here,
three big offers.</i>

01:23:34.096 --> 01:23:35.758
Hey!

01:23:35.832 --> 01:23:36.958
Any of these three would be fine.

01:23:37.033 --> 01:23:40.002
<i>No, no, no, ain't no need to rush,
homey, we got all the leverage here.</i>

01:23:40.503 --> 01:23:42.471
<i>All right, what we have is an opportunity</i>

01:23:42.538 --> 01:23:44.597
to pit all three of these suckas
against each other

01:23:44.674 --> 01:23:46.107
and just grind 'em into the dirt.

01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:50.243
<i>Just take 'em for every last penny
they got, you know, and...</i>

01:23:51.914 --> 01:23:55.077
<i>In an entirely spiritual way, of course.</i>

01:23:55.985 --> 01:23:57.543
<i>You know what, Aaron?
You're the big agent now.</i>

01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:59.713
<i>You got your name on the door.
Why don't you pick, huh?</i>

01:24:01.924 --> 01:24:03.824
May I interest you in a slice of pie?

01:24:03.893 --> 01:24:06.418
<i>I'd love to, but I really have someplace
important I need to be right now.</i>

01:24:06.496 --> 01:24:08.487
What? More important than pie?

01:24:08.564 --> 01:24:11.260
<i>Actually, yes. But give me another hug.</i>

01:24:12.668 --> 01:24:13.999
I love you!

01:24:15.705 --> 01:24:19.402
That's right. I'm the big agent now.
That's my name on the door.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.511
Steven!

01:24:27.116 --> 01:24:30.279
Why is there a wasabi pea
in my Asian trail mix?

01:24:31.354 --> 01:24:34.323
<i>I am so sorry, Mr. Wiseberger.
I thought I got them all.</i>

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:36.824
<i>Well, here's one.</i>

01:24:36.893 --> 01:24:38.326
There's a delivery for you.

01:24:38.394 --> 01:24:39.986
<i>Well, bring it in.</i>

01:24:47.203 --> 01:24:49.265
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:24:50.073 --> 01:24:51.370
<i>Hold still, let me get this open for you.</i>

01:24:51.441 --> 01:24:52.840
<i>Jack, I don't like surprises.
You know I don't.</i>

01:24:52.909 --> 01:24:53.898
You're gonna like this one.

01:24:53.976 --> 01:24:55.967
You know what happened
the last time I tried to do a surprise...

01:24:56.045 --> 01:24:57.239
- You're gonna like this one.
- What is going on?

01:24:57.313 --> 01:24:58.302
- I'm putting the baby down.
- Okay.

01:24:58.381 --> 01:24:59.814
<i>Okay, all right, okay.</i>

01:24:59.882 --> 01:25:02.248
<i>- Can we please take it off?
- Okay, now, I'll take the blindfold off.</i>

01:25:02.318 --> 01:25:05.310
<i>- Yes, please, take it off.
- Take it off. Okay.</i>

01:25:11.227 --> 01:25:14.321
<i>Jack, this is the house
I've been trying to get you to come see.</i>

01:25:14.397 --> 01:25:16.365
You have to see the inside.

01:25:16.432 --> 01:25:18.297
I've already seen the inside.

01:25:18.367 --> 01:25:20.528
What do you... Why?

01:25:20.603 --> 01:25:22.230
Are you thinking about making an offer?

01:25:22.305 --> 01:25:23.397
Oh, no, I can't.

01:25:23.473 --> 01:25:27.464
- Why not?
- I already own it.

01:25:37.687 --> 01:25:40.520
This is a step in the right direction.

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:42.679
Yes, but...

01:25:42.725 --> 01:25:45.093
you can't just do this one thing, Jack,

01:25:45.094 --> 01:25:47.028
and think that everything
is gonna be hunky-dory.

01:25:47.096 --> 01:25:49.064
- That's not how it works.
- I hear you.

01:25:49.132 --> 01:25:50.626
You do?

01:25:51.567 --> 01:25:52.829
You hear that?

01:25:52.902 --> 01:25:54.662
What?

01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:57.570
The silence.

01:25:57.874 --> 01:25:59.939
It's quiet.

01:26:00.209 --> 01:26:02.240
I like it.

01:26:03.613 --> 01:26:05.612
Who are you?

01:26:09.252 --> 01:26:10.580
Honey, the tree.

01:26:10.653 --> 01:26:11.950
How did... - Oh, yeah.

01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:15.223
I had Gaudencio carefully
dig it up and next thing you know...

01:26:15.224 --> 01:26:17.750
Boom, it's a tree there.

01:26:17.827 --> 01:26:19.926
Boom. - Boom.

01:26:23.799 --> 01:26:25.967
Boom, boom, boom.

01:26:25.968 --> 01:26:27.369
- Did he say, "Boom"?
- Yes.

01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:29.670
Boom. - Oh, shoot!
