The great Leonardo da Vinci,

03:59.907 --> 04:02.201
who I'm certain was a warlock,
although it's never been proven.

04:02.284 --> 04:06.330
In his masterpiece, <i>The Last Supper,</i>
depicted grilled eels,

04:06.413 --> 04:08.624
bread and wine on the table.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.126
I've chosen caviar
from the Caspian Sea

04:11.710 --> 04:13.295
served on blinis,

04:13.378 --> 04:14.838
along with champagne.

04:16.215 --> 04:17.758
as fitting stand-ins

04:17.841 --> 04:20.427
as we partake of our own last supper.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.972
For one of you,
a last moment of freedom and anonymity

04:24.056 --> 04:26.266
before assuming the Supremacy.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.354
For any one of you others,
possibly a last meal.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.065
CORDELIA: Since the beginning
of this coven,

04:33.148 --> 04:35.943
it has been every outgoing Supreme's duty

04:36.026 --> 04:37.861
to identify her successor.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.864
Which Fiona not only neglected to do,

04:41.740 --> 04:44.451
she actually tried to kill her successor.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.914
So we are doing something
never done in our history.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.544
We are going to give all four of you
the chance to prove yourselves.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.004
Only one of you will succeed.

04:57.089 --> 04:58.799
To quote the Bible…

04:58.882 --> 05:00.133
loosely…

05:00.217 --> 05:02.052
"When I was a child,

05:02.135 --> 05:03.136
"I spoke like a child,

"But when I became a woman,

MISTY DAY: What if I can't do it?

05:54.938 --> 05:56.231
Then you're not the Supreme.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.900
And you can go back to your swamp.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.736
Misty, you're first.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.207

(CHUCKLING) I did it. I did it.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.228

-CORDELIA: It's not about want.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.731
You either are
or you aren't a Supreme.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.941
Maybe I am.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.235
Queenie?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.949
Yup.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.786

It's a tricky little craft.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.562
When properly exercised,

07:16.645 --> 07:19.398
can bend the strongest of wills
to your desire.

It's the getting back, darlings,
that is the challenge.

that being an authority figure
requires you to make hard,

30:11.186 --> 30:13.105

They've matured so much,
I think they can handle it.

30:16.817 --> 30:17.943
I was talking about you.

30:19.695 --> 30:20.779
Me?

30:20.863 --> 30:21.989
You have every chance to be

30:22.072 --> 30:24.199
the greatest Supreme
this coven has ever seen.

30:24.283 --> 30:25.367
Stop.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.744
Delia, I have something to say,

30:27.828 --> 30:30.038
and your tasteful modesty
is out of fashion,

30:30.122 --> 30:31.248
so knock it off.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.418
Thanks to you,
we're entering a new era.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.587
You've planted the seeds,

30:36.670 --> 30:38.797
but in order to reap their harvest,

30:38.881 --> 30:40.841
you have to clear the rot of the past.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.302
Myrtle, you know
I love your metaphors,

30:43.385 --> 30:45.179
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:45.262 --> 30:46.638
Me. I'm talking about me.

30:47.973 --> 30:50.893
We all know what happens to a witch
who grievously harms another witch.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.150
I hope you're not suggesting…

30:58.233 --> 31:00.903
I'm not suggesting.
I'm insisting.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.284
You want to be burned at the stake?

31:08.827 --> 31:09.828
Again?

31:10.329 --> 31:11.955
Want has nothing to do with it.

31:12.873 --> 31:14.583
At the start of your glorious reign,

31:14.666 --> 31:17.085
the last thing you need
is an ABSCAM or Watergate.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.796
I killed, and I must pay for it.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.798
Now, before word leaks,

31:21.882 --> 31:24.551
and you are tainted by my hubris
and actions, however deserved…

31:24.635 --> 31:27.554
Myrtle, stop talking.

31:28.263 --> 31:29.389
I didn't hear this.

31:29.473 --> 31:30.557
I didn't.

31:30.641 --> 31:31.892
Listen to me, child.

31:32.309 --> 31:36.021
Now that you're in charge,
my life's work is fulfilled.

31:36.104 --> 31:39.066
I've made many painful mistakes
in my life.

31:39.608 --> 31:41.652
I want my death
to have some meaning.

31:41.735 --> 31:42.778
No!

31:42.861 --> 31:44.071
No way!

31:45.280 --> 31:47.157
You were my mother,

31:47.616 --> 31:49.159
my true mother,

31:49.535 --> 31:51.537
just as you promised you would be,

31:53.038 --> 31:55.082
and I can't do this without you.

Everything you do or say
ripples through the entire coven.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.631
You cannot be a hypocrite.

You two are powerful witches

34:41.582 --> 34:44.793
with more skills and confidence
at your young age

34:44.877 --> 34:46.920
than I had for much of my life.

34:47.004 --> 34:49.715
I need both of you
to help me fulfill the promise

who the next Supreme is.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.005
Why? Why would
she decide to do that?

36:12.798 --> 36:14.842
Because the old Supreme
will be dead.

on eternity.

44:41.473 --> 44:43.684
Oh, no. Jesus Christ.

44:44.768 --> 44:45.769
Oh…

44:48.438 --> 44:50.190
If you want a stiff one,

44:50.274 --> 44:51.483
come over here.

44:55.237 --> 44:56.321
(GROANS)

44:56.405 --> 44:57.739
Don't be vulgar.

44:58.198 --> 44:59.616
-Oh!
-(GLASS SHATTERING)

45:00.701 --> 45:02.619
-Maybe you ought to…
-(GROANS)

45:02.703 --> 45:04.830
…lay off the sauce for a while.

45:04.913 --> 45:06.582
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

45:07.207 --> 45:09.501
Drink in the, the fresh air.

45:13.839 --> 45:15.048
(GROANS)

45:18.010 --> 45:19.178
(SPITS)

45:21.555 --> 45:22.723
Delia did this.

45:22.806 --> 45:26.185
No, nobody sent you here,
but you, baby.

45:26.894 --> 45:28.312
We had a deal.

45:29.563 --> 45:30.898
Oh, God.

45:31.690 --> 45:34.067
I can't spend eternity here.

45:34.151 --> 45:35.277
This place…

45:36.528 --> 45:39.406
It reeks of fish

45:40.741 --> 45:42.159
and cat piss.

45:42.242 --> 45:43.327
(WHIMPERS)

45:43.410 --> 45:44.953
What is this?

45:45.037 --> 45:46.496
Knotty pine?

45:47.956 --> 45:49.374
I want Delia.

45:50.334 --> 45:52.461
-It's too late for that.
-I want my daughter.

45:52.544 --> 45:54.087
No, come on, you're here.

45:54.171 --> 45:56.006
-(WHIMPERING)
-You're here.

45:56.548 --> 45:57.758
With me.

45:58.133 --> 46:00.677
Nobody is going anywhere.

46:01.053 --> 46:02.095
Oh.

46:02.179 --> 46:03.388
I'm in heaven.

46:05.432 --> 46:08.727
-So just, uh, relax. You're here.
-Oh, no.

46:11.230 --> 46:12.481
(AXEMAN LAUGHING)

46:14.858 --> 46:16.777
(LAUGHING)

46:18.695 --> 46:20.322

46:23.992 --> 46:25.494
(FOOTSTEPS ECHO)

46:31.166 --> 46:32.835
All right… (EXHALES)

46:32.918 --> 46:34.169
…let's open the doors.

46:43.679 --> 46:46.348
CORDELIA: <i>Miss Robichaux's Academy</i>
<i>for Exceptional Young Ladies</i>

46:46.431 --> 46:50.269

<i>finishing school in 1790.</i>

46:50.352 --> 46:52.521
<i>Afterwards, it came</i>

46:53.188 --> 46:54.565
<i>Our management.</i>

46:56.275 --> 46:57.651
We survived.

46:58.986 --> 47:01.738
Up until now,
that's all we've done.

47:03.365 --> 47:04.908
But as I look at your faces,

47:06.076 --> 47:07.411
all of them beautiful,

47:07.494 --> 47:08.996
all of them perfect,

47:10.289 --> 47:11.832
I know together

47:13.000 --> 47:14.793
we can do more than survive.

47:15.794 --> 47:18.130
It's our time to thrive.

47:18.922 --> 47:20.007
What's a Supreme?

47:20.090 --> 47:21.425
You're looking at her.
