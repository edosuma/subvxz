00:28.729 --> 00:30.798
- Connor?

00:30.798 --> 00:33.000
- Go back to sleep.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.803
- Where you going?

00:35.803 --> 00:38.306
- I have some work to do at the
lab.

00:38.306 --> 00:42.276
- This late?

00:42.276 --> 00:44.778
Are you going to come back to bed
after?

00:44.778 --> 00:47.047
- Not tonight.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.350
Sweet dreams, okay?

00:49.350 --> 00:52.720
I'll call you tomorrow.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.841
- Hey.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.244
- Where are you?

02:56.244 --> 02:59.347
- I'm on my way to class.
What's up?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.249
- Well, I thought of all mornings
you would've at least stuck
around for today's.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.650
- Yeah, I know I wanted to,

03:02.650 --> 03:05.253
but I had a ton of work to do,

03:05.253 --> 03:07.054
and we're really close on a
breakthrough on the project.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.822
So I have to review some data.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.758
- Well just don't forget about
tonight.

03:10.758 --> 03:14.562
I made reservations for seven at your
favorite place.

03:14.562 --> 03:18.198
- Alright. Look, I promise I'll be there
I gotta let you go.
Class is starting.

03:18.198 --> 03:26.907
- Don't forget that you're
supposed to check out my car.
I think the battery...

03:26.907 --> 03:28.476
- Now if we could just measure
the

03:28.476 --> 03:30.444
wave of the particle in direct

03:30.444 --> 03:33.013
relation to the
atmospheric conditions

03:33.013 --> 03:35.349
set aside by the particles
momentum

03:35.349 --> 03:38.852
we could, in theory, figure out

03:38.852 --> 03:44.592
the exact precise position of an
electron nucleus in space.

03:44.592 --> 03:50.097
You in the back row reading the book.
Yes.

03:50.097 --> 03:53.834
Would you mind sharing with us what
it is that you are reading?

03:53.834 --> 03:57.871
Don't worry, you're not in trouble.
I just was curious as to what has
your full attention.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.308
- I'm sorry I have a Lit test next
class.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.343
I had no time to study.

04:02.343 --> 04:07.348
- You mind if I take a look?

04:07.348 --> 04:10.984
Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet.

04:10.984 --> 04:16.123
Now this book is the greatest
writing of human nature to date.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.826
Would you agree? Yes.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.928
Now human nature is an anomaly.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.097
There is no exact science as to how
man

04:24.097 --> 04:27.468
would react to his environment, or
love.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.571
In Romeo and Julia they both
commit suicide

04:30.571 --> 04:34.342
on the belief that they lost the one
they loved.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.277
Sorry if I ruined it for any of
you.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.248
What I'm trying to say is human
nature is all a random
occurrence

04:41.248 --> 04:43.551
with no proven method.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.553
That's why science so important,

04:45.553 --> 04:51.525
because it is precise,
it is exact.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.194
It's reality.

04:54.194 --> 04:58.699
Science is the only thing
that you can trust.

04:58.699 --> 05:02.636
It's the only thing I trust.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.707
How many of you think you can trust
in love?

05:08.241 --> 05:11.078
Our hopeless romantics in class.

05:11.078 --> 05:15.483
Mathematics is the only
international language.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.217
Science is the only proven
method...

05:21.422 --> 05:24.291
All right, we will continue next
week with dissecting

05:24.291 --> 05:26.660
the flaws of Einstein's Theory of
Relativity.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.631
So, everyone please study up.

05:30.631 --> 05:37.170
And I don't mean Shakespeare.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.572
- Hey.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.708
- Hey Julia.

05:40.708 --> 05:44.412
- That was great.
Comparing human nature to science.

05:44.412 --> 05:47.114
- Figured you would've stuck with
the rest of the girls siding
with love.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.317
- I'm a science girl at heart.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.653
- Well, sometimes I feel like
you're the only one who gets me
in here.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.221
Look, I gotta run real quick.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.623
I will see you in the lab later?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.024
- Of course.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.426
- Great.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.646
- Give me something new Jonas.

06:18.646 --> 06:23.150
- Oh, I'm afraid I can't. Sixty
minutes just like every other
time.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.585
- How's Walter?

06:24.585 --> 06:27.220
- Never better.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.823
- Walter. Last time you get to
name the mouse.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.525
- Why is his time constant still
holding us up?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.598
- You know, maybe we need to be more
drastic,

06:37.598 --> 06:39.166
- What if we increase the
electromagnetic energy

06:39.166 --> 06:41.569
to 30,000 volts?

06:41.569 --> 06:45.338
- Yeah, maybe that's double the
input of every other time.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.974
That could be disastrous.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.376
- Then what can we try?

06:49.376 --> 06:50.778
I mean, I refuse to believe that
these results

06:50.778 --> 06:53.280
are the extent of our research.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.215
- Connor, we're on the cutting
edge of something,

06:55.215 --> 06:56.817
and no one has ever even come close topp

06:56.817 --> 06:58.218
It takes time.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.620
- Time we don't have...

06:59.620 --> 07:01.021
We're two deadlines behind.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.457
- Time wisely used is time best
spent.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.994
If we rush we're bound to make
mistakes.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.463
All right. Let's wrap it up for
tonight,

07:09.463 --> 07:11.532
and start fresh in the morning.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.333
It's been a long day.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.735
- What time is it?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.504
- Almost seven.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.706
- Damnit. I got to go.

07:18.706 --> 07:22.576
Can you guys finish up everything
here?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
- Catching you on the way out I
hope.

07:24.578 --> 07:28.315
- Actually you were.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.117
- Why don't you stick around
Connor?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.720
You can show me how all of this
works.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.955
- Look, I'm really late for
something.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.690
Jonas. He can show you anything
you need to know.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.359
- It wasn't a suggestion son.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.963
Besides, what could
possibly be

07:42.963 --> 07:50.470
more important than all of this?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.072
- How's it going?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.574
- Good thank you.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.776
- Can I get you anything?

07:55.776 --> 07:59.412
- No, I'm still waiting on
someone.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.616
- Special occasion?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.117
- It's our anniversary.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.919
- Congratulations.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.354
How long have you been married?

08:07.354 --> 08:09.456
- We're not yet.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.424
We're still engaged.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.694
- Oh. Well, when's the big day?

08:13.694 --> 08:16.730
- Haven't set one yet.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.367
- Well, I'm sure it will be
wonderful when you do.

08:20.367 --> 08:26.106
If you need anything let me
know, okay?

08:28.609 --> 08:32.011
- What would happen if you shut this
down while it's operating?

08:32.011 --> 08:35.282
- Everything inside of it would
be destroyed.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.919
We have unfortunately learned that
lesson the hard way.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.022
The machine is designed to offset
minor power centers,

08:42.022 --> 08:45.859
but you can never remove the power
source entirely.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.228
- What is the relevance of 60
minutes?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.598
Why can't you surpass that
duration?

08:50.598 --> 08:53.601
- We don't know.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.303
What we're working on could be
the foundation for all time travel.

08:56.303 --> 09:00.373
- But technically you two haven't
travelled anywhere.

09:00.373 --> 09:05.278
All you've done is skip a
laboratory rat forward 60
minutes.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.715
But that time never existed.
Is that correct?

09:07.715 --> 09:12.119
- Essentially yes, but it's
complicated.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.856
We're working on an equation that
could measure time.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.725
In theory be able to pinpoint an
exact moment in time

09:17.725 --> 09:23.363
and then travel to it.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.833
- When the government first
asked me

09:25.833 --> 09:29.302
they had a special agency on the
forefront of time travel.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.939
Frankly, I thought it was
ridiculous.

09:31.939 --> 09:37.277
But I have to say you two have
surpassed

09:37.277 --> 09:40.380
what I thought was possible.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.850
But just because I'm impressed,

09:42.850 --> 09:46.153
does not mean that the folks
upstairs are convinced.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.790
There are a lot of people, including
myself,

09:49.790 --> 09:53.560
that think all of this is a waste of
money.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.765
So, if you two would like to keep yourpp

09:57.765 --> 09:59.733
I suggest you, Connor, figure
out

09:59.733 --> 10:04.838
that equation and fast.

10:04.838 --> 10:09.176
Good evening gentlemen, and
miss.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.222
- Well, that was pleasant.

10:22.222 --> 10:26.159
- Developing an equation to
measure and travel through time.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.560
If there's something you're not
telling me Connor,

10:27.560 --> 10:29.562
now would be a good time.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.998
- What did you expect me to say?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.365
The guy was breathing down my
neck.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.767
- Don't beat yourself up about
it.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.435
We'll figure it out.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.637
- Hey, come on. I'll buy you a
drink.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.206
You look like you could use one.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.574
- Thanks, but I can't.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.476
I gotta go home, and find a way
to get

10:43.476 --> 10:47.915
April to forgive me for ditching her.
Again.

11:04.865 --> 11:09.970
- That ought to light a fire under
their asses.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.873
I want you two to stay here. Watch
this place close.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.476
Anything goes on here,
I want to know about it.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.312
This has already gone too far.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.314
Somehow they've managed to
succeed.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.816
Our orders have been shutting this
thing down

11:22.816 --> 11:25.218
before this thing gets out of
control.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.653
If this information ever gets
out

11:26.653 --> 11:28.088
we could be in a world of
trouble.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.589
- Don't worry sir.

11:29.589 --> 11:32.092
We'll keep an eye on everything.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.862
- You two take no action without
consulting me first.

11:34.862 --> 11:44.872
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.683
- I'm so sorry.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.085
- Don't waste your breath.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.486
I don't want to hear it.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.889
- Something came up all right.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.290
Just as I was heading out the
door.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.758
- Something always comes up.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.962
You forgot my birthday,

12:08.962 --> 12:12.065
but our anniversary for Christ's
sake?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.501
You couldn't even call.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.503
- The government agency overseeing
our grant

12:16.503 --> 12:18.605
showed up at the last minute
unexpectedly.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.007
- Sometimes I feel like you love
your experiments

12:20.007 --> 12:21.708
more than you love me.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.443
- You know that's not true.

12:23.443 --> 12:27.781
Things have just been crazy at
work.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.216
The minute the project's over I can
dedicate

12:29.216 --> 12:31.952
more time to us.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.655
- I can't promise I'm just going to
stick around that long.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.826
We were supposed to set a date
tonight.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.694
- I know, and I'll make it up to
you, I promise.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.596
Friday. Friday. We'll pick
another day.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.999
Any day you want.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.836
- It is not just about the date.

12:48.836 --> 12:52.172
I need to know that you care enough
about me.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.976
That you want to marry me.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.211
Blowing me off on our
anniversary

12:58.211 --> 13:00.747
doesn't say that you do.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.349
- You know you mean the world
to me.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.451
- Then show me.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.854
- As soon as this project is
over,

13:06.854 --> 13:09.322
we can do everything that you want to
do.

13:09.322 --> 13:13.160
We can spend all of our time on the
wedding.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.429
I just need a couple weeks.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.432
Just a couple weeks.
That's all I'm asking for.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.003
Please?

13:23.003 --> 13:26.739
- Do you promise on Friday we'll
pick a date?

13:26.739 --> 13:30.577
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

13:30.577 --> 13:41.321
And I promise I won't be late.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.923
Oh, I got you something.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.292
- What is it?

13:45.292 --> 13:52.099
- Just because I was late doesn't meanpp

13:52.099 --> 13:57.304
- Perfect.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.906
I got you something too,

13:58.906 --> 14:01.942
but I want to wait 'til Friday.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.177
There's something I want
to add to it.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.147
- You're beautiful for getting me
something.

14:19.826 --> 14:33.573
- Hey, hold on.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.844
I still can't believe he blew off
your anniversary.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.213
- Something important came up at
work.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.250
- So important that he couldn't even
call you?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.285
I don't know why you keep putting
up with him.

14:45.285 --> 14:50.857
- Because I love him.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.360
- Well, you are my sister, and I
love you.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.163
But you are naive.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.198
Is this really how you want to
spend the rest of your life?

14:58.198 --> 15:03.236
Always coming in second?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.672
- I think I'm going to go surprise
him tonight at the lab,

15:05.672 --> 15:07.507
and tell him I don't care about a
date.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.677
I just want to be with him.

15:10.677 --> 15:15.415
- I hope you're right.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.186
- Hey, two cups of coffee sir.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.789
What are you working on?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.491
- I was playing around with some
equations last night,

15:24.491 --> 15:28.028
and I think I got it.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.630
- Got what?

15:30.630 --> 15:35.302
- A formula to map and travel
through time.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.071
- So if this is correct,

15:38.071 --> 15:41.408
then it's not the increased
electromagnetism

15:41.408 --> 15:43.210
that projects a matter through time
and space,

15:43.210 --> 15:46.879
but it's combination of
balancing

15:46.879 --> 15:50.217
electromagnetic energy
with atomic polarity?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.352
This is amazing!

15:52.352 --> 15:54.821
- The way I see it,

15:54.821 --> 15:57.057
if we can rapidly spin two magnets
facing the same pole

15:57.057 --> 15:59.159
we can generate a changing magnetic
field

15:59.159 --> 16:01.728
creating an electromagnetic
induction.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.830
- Ah, and all we need are electronic
bursts

16:03.830 --> 16:06.933
to get the photons moving at the speedpp

16:06.933 --> 16:10.370
Thus, creating a wormhole in time and
space.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.872
This is right along the lines of
Einstein's theory

16:12.872 --> 16:14.774
on general relativity.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.209
- It's raw. It's really raw, but I
think...

16:16.209 --> 16:18.645
I think this could work.

16:18.645 --> 16:25.685
- I think you've done it.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.920
- I still can't believe it.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.889
I underestimated you kid.

16:29.889 --> 16:34.427
- Well, it's the last time you
do.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.129
- What's going on?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.931
- Well, it appears that he's done
it.

16:38.931 --> 16:43.270
Connor has discovered how to travel
back in time.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.173
- That's amazing.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.007
- Well, it's just an equation
until we actually test the
theory out.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.876
- Either way, we should
celebrate.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.244
- I'd love to, but I can't.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.613
I got to meet April in an hour.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.148
I told her we'd pick a wedding date
tonight.

16:55.148 --> 16:59.752
- Oh, that's great.

16:59.752 --> 17:03.190
You're a brilliant man, and she's
lucky to have you.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.192
- This is the breakthrough we
needed.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.594
See if you could contact
Spencer.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.996
Maybe we can get some more
funding

17:09.996 --> 17:11.397
to start building a new machine to
test the theory out.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.999
- I'm on it.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.062
- Connor!

17:43.062 --> 17:45.865
- Hey Julia.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.834
- I just wanted to tell you that
your were amazing today.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.802
I'm so honored I get to work
with you.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.738
You're incredible.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.140
- Thank you. It means a lot.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.377
- Wait, Connor.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.911
That's not what I came here to tell
you.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.448
There's no easy way to say this,

18:01.448 --> 18:03.550
but from the moment I have laid
eyes on you

18:03.550 --> 18:05.084
I've been attracted to you,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.754
and the way you look at me

18:07.754 --> 18:09.889
I can't help but think you feel
the same way.

18:09.889 --> 18:20.600
- Julia, I think that we...

18:24.571 --> 18:25.972
- What's wrong?

18:25.972 --> 18:28.675
- I'm engaged to April.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.977
Look, I knew it was going to be hard
working with you,

18:30.977 --> 18:35.182
because you're obviously
intelligent and a beautiful
girl.

18:35.182 --> 18:39.219
But I think it's best if we just keep
things strictly professional
between us.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.620
- I'm so embarrassed.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.822
- Don't be. It was honest.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.591
- I don't want this to change
anything between us.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.293
- It won't.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.694
- Thank you.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.095
- All right?
- Yeah.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.497
- I'll see you tomorrow.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.567
- It's Spencer.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.103
Hello?

18:57.103 --> 18:58.805
- Get everything ready. It's going
down tonight.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.241
- Yes sir. We'll be ready.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.676
- Yeah, they figured it out
faster than we thought.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.077
But we have to shut them down before
things get out of control.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.347
I'm on my way now.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.182
- They figured it out.

19:09.182 --> 19:21.661
We're taking them down tonight.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.649
- Hello?

19:42.649 --> 19:45.985
- Hi, it's Kristine. Everything all
right?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.187
- No.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.124
- Why? What's wrong?

19:52.124 --> 19:55.495
- When I went to surprise
Connor,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.665
he was kissing his assistant.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.268
I think they're having an
affair.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.836
- I'm so sorry.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.873
Is there something that I can
do?

20:06.873 --> 20:27.394
- Okay.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.443
- What are you doing?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.844
What's the meaning of this?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.211
What's going on here?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.180
- You are being shut down.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.949
This project has been
terminated.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.351
- On what grounds?

21:24.351 --> 21:26.052
- You Jonas,

21:26.052 --> 21:28.655
you were never meant to get this
far.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.723
You were were employed on this
project

21:30.723 --> 21:33.526
to prove time travel was not
possible.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.927
But you two,

21:34.927 --> 21:37.397
you end up proving it was.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.767
Now if this information were to ever
get out,

21:40.767 --> 21:46.573
it'd prove to be highly
problematic.

21:46.573 --> 21:49.409
You are being shut down to make
sure

21:49.409 --> 21:52.311
that this technology never falls
into the wrong hands.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.880
- I wouldn't touch that if I were
you.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.715
- Then you do it.

21:55.715 --> 22:00.119
I have no time for games.

22:00.119 --> 22:04.591
Make sure you take everything
important.

22:04.591 --> 22:08.060
Oh, and Jonas,

22:08.060 --> 22:13.232
don't even think about continuing
your research either.

22:13.232 --> 22:18.405
Or you will force me to take more
drastic measures.

22:18.405 --> 22:24.043
Ones I guarantee you will not
like.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.280
[Recording: You have
reached Connor Hughes.

23:01.280 --> 23:15.762
Please leave a message.]

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
- Hello?

23:22.469 --> 23:25.772
- April. Hey, where are you?

23:25.772 --> 23:27.139
- I saw you with her.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.141
- Hello?

23:29.141 --> 23:31.077
- I said it's over Connor.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.179
- I can't... Hello?

23:33.179 --> 23:34.581
- I saw you...

23:36.015 --> 23:53.500
- April?

23:53.500 --> 24:06.145
It was all for nothing.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.647
I lost everything.

24:07.647 --> 24:11.818
All because

24:11.818 --> 24:16.088
I was blinded by what I thought was
important.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.424
- You couldn't have known.

24:18.424 --> 24:21.260
Life is unpredictable like that
sometimes.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.530
It just takes something away from
you

24:23.530 --> 24:26.132
faster than you can imagine.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.035
- How did you do it?

24:29.035 --> 24:33.272
How did you keep going after the
accident?

24:33.272 --> 24:35.174
After Carol died?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.776
- One day at a time.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.078
It's all you can do.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.479
- Get any easier?

24:40.479 --> 24:43.215
- Eventually it will.

24:43.215 --> 24:50.256
Wounds heal, and you get on with your
life.

24:50.256 --> 25:05.905
Look what they left behind.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.408
Why don't you take Walter?

25:09.408 --> 25:21.621
I think the company would do you
good.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.223
Connor,

25:24.223 --> 25:27.293
It wasn't all for nothing.

25:27.293 --> 25:43.242
Never is.

27:54.173 --> 27:59.145
- Hard to believe a whole year has
gone by.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.648
I miss her so much.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.283
As much as she loved you

28:04.283 --> 28:06.753
it was just never enough was it?

28:06.753 --> 28:09.055
You always had to have more.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.357
- What are you talking about?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.759
- The night she was killed

28:12.759 --> 28:17.029
she saw you kissing your
assistant.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.165
She was so upset when I called.

28:19.165 --> 28:24.370
She could barely talk let alone
drive.

28:24.370 --> 28:28.340
So, she walked to my place.

28:28.340 --> 28:33.179
All she wanted to do was tell you
that

28:33.179 --> 28:35.314
picking a wedding date
wasn't important.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.184
As long as you two were
together.

28:38.184 --> 28:41.353
That's how much she loved you.

28:41.353 --> 28:45.291
She was willing to put your
priorities ahead of her own.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.159
- I had no idea.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.628
- Oh, of course you wouldn't.

28:49.628 --> 28:54.700
All you ever thought about was
yourself.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.435
Never once would you even
consider

28:56.435 --> 29:00.807
putting her needs ahead of
your own.

29:00.807 --> 29:04.043
Now she's gone forever.

29:04.043 --> 29:28.968
I hope you're happy.

29:59.198 --> 30:03.069
- Jonas, it's Connor.

30:03.069 --> 30:14.613
We need to talk.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.416
What is this place?

30:17.416 --> 30:26.492
- Come on in you'll see.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.295
A friend let me use this place.

30:29.295 --> 30:33.299
What I want you to see is right aroundpp

30:33.299 --> 30:35.434
Couldn't let them just
destroy everything weve been
working on.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.037
So, I made copies of all the
data,

30:38.037 --> 30:40.806
and I continued our research
here

30:40.806 --> 30:46.913
where they can't find me.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.015
- I can't believe it.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.017
You actually built it.

30:51.017 --> 30:54.120
- It's not exactly a finished
quite yet.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.922
Still have lot to do on it.

30:55.922 --> 30:58.457
A few kinks to work out.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.726
- Why didn't you tell me about this
earlier?

31:00.726 --> 31:03.429
- I knew what you were going
through,

31:03.429 --> 31:05.064
and I didn't want to bring it up
until you were ready.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.899
- This is amazing.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.168
This is exactly like my
drawings.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.970
- I had to improvise a few
things,

31:10.970 --> 31:19.411
but I think it's pretty close.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.812
- If my calculations are
correct,

31:20.812 --> 31:22.814
and 60 minutes is the constant

31:22.814 --> 31:24.483
in which all living matter can
travel through time,

31:24.483 --> 31:26.318
that gives me enough time to travel
back

31:26.318 --> 31:28.787
and save April from getting hit by
that car.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.190
- There's just one problem with
that.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.658
I haven't yet figured out how to
precisely

31:32.658 --> 31:34.760
map and measure time in order

31:34.760 --> 31:38.530
to get you back to a specific
point.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.932
- The earth's rotation is what causes
time to pass right?

31:39.932 --> 31:41.800
- Right.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.202
- By using an atomic clock

31:43.202 --> 31:45.604
we can calculate the exact time
pass

31:45.604 --> 31:47.173
and use it to identify specific
instances

31:47.173 --> 31:49.341
into the past precise to the
minute.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.877
Once we measure the waves,

31:51.877 --> 31:54.246
it's just a matter of finding the
correct combination

31:54.246 --> 31:56.348
of electromagnetic energy and
velocity.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.950
- Let's hope you're right.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.551
Let's hope this theory works.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.520
- It has to work.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.830
- Are you ready?

32:44.830 --> 32:47.433
- Yeah.

33:04.050 --> 33:06.452
- I think we're going to need some
kind of surge protection

33:06.452 --> 33:09.155
to keep this thing from shutting
down during your trip.

33:09.155 --> 33:25.371
- More power wouldn't do
anything.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.772
It's ready.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.940
Send me back to 7:14pm

33:28.940 --> 33:31.243
on October 15th of last year.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.112
- Don't you think we should at
least test it first?

33:33.112 --> 33:34.880
We don't know what'll happen.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.815
We don't know if it'll work.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.218
All right. We'll send Walter.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.619
- We're not doing anything with
that thing.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.221
- Jonas, I'm ready.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.690
- You're the smart one.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.558
If something gets messed up, or
you don't get back,

33:46.558 --> 33:49.561
I don't know if I can figure out
how to fix it.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.299
That way, if something happens you
can fix it.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.833
- You sure about this?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.802
- Well, we don't have much choice
do we?

33:56.802 --> 33:58.837
You send me back to the night she
dies.

33:58.837 --> 34:18.056
That way we'll know if we calculated
the time right or not.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.958
- If my calculations are
correct,

34:19.958 --> 34:22.928
this is going to send you back to
that exact position.

34:22.928 --> 34:25.964
How do you know any of this is going
to be the same?

34:25.964 --> 34:29.601
- We don't.

34:29.601 --> 34:36.641
- Good luck.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.056
You all right?

34:52.056 --> 34:54.460
- I am.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.102
- Does it work?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.571
- It does.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.910
- What was it like?

35:11.910 --> 35:15.614
- Well, it wasn't the smoothest
ride.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.184
- Where'd you get that?

35:18.184 --> 35:20.819
- I could do more than an hour
somehow.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.588
- Now that I know that it works,

35:22.588 --> 35:24.356
I'm going back.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.193
- Connor, take the night.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.195
Think about what you're going to do
when you go back.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.297
Besides, we don't want to
risk

35:31.297 --> 35:33.031
overloading the machine on
it's first day.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.700
- Jonas, I've waited long
enough.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.302
- Another day isn't going to kill
you Connor.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.304
You've only got an hour.

35:38.304 --> 35:42.341
You need to be prepared.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.178
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

35:46.178 --> 35:49.114
I can't believe it works.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.795
- Another, Connor.

36:03.795 --> 36:07.766
I think going back in time would
change the outcome.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.436
And it doesn't get reset until you go
back again.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.538
So, you have to be extremely

36:12.538 --> 36:15.441
careful with what you
interact and what you do.

36:15.441 --> 36:18.244
Your actions could cause a chain
reaction

36:18.244 --> 36:21.847
that could completely alter reality
as we know it.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.415
- That's what I'm planning on.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.384
- Be careful.

36:25.384 --> 36:31.056
Avoid your previous self at all
times.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.711
- Ah, God.

36:52.711 --> 36:57.082
The roof?

36:57.082 --> 37:06.825
Ah, you can't worry about this
Jonas.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.562
- Oh no.

37:10.562 --> 37:18.904
Come on!

37:39.024 --> 38:08.086
- Ahh!

38:08.086 --> 38:09.488
- April!

38:14.360 --> 38:17.963
- Are you crazy to jump out in
traffic like that?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.098
You all right?

38:20.098 --> 38:21.767
I can get you an ambulance.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.969
- No, I don't have time for an
ambulance.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.371
- What about my car?

38:26.772 --> 38:28.173
- April.

38:28.173 --> 38:29.575
- Hello?

38:29.575 --> 38:30.976
- April!

38:30.976 --> 38:32.378
- I saw you...

38:58.870 --> 39:03.809
- It was too late. I couldn't save
her.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.211
- What's with the leg?

39:06.211 --> 39:10.248
- Got hit by a car trying to get to
her.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.851
Shouldn't I have returned
to normal when I got back?

39:12.851 --> 39:15.320
Why am I still feeling the
effects?

39:15.320 --> 39:20.291
- Look. Time passes here exactly
the same as it passes in the
past.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.060
So, when something happens to you
in the past,

39:22.060 --> 39:23.729
and you come back here,

39:23.729 --> 39:27.298
it will continue until you go back
and change it.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.334
So, when you avoid that car on your
next trip

39:29.334 --> 39:31.036
it'll be just like it never happened
to you before.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.938
And when you come back here,

39:32.938 --> 39:37.843
that will no longer be your
reality.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.779
- I need a better plan the next
time I go back.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.213
You think you can hack into the
phone company records?

39:42.213 --> 39:44.349
- Sure. Why?

39:44.349 --> 39:46.818
- If I get April's phone records

39:46.818 --> 39:48.253
I can find out where she was that
night.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.589
- Do what I can.

39:50.589 --> 39:55.060
- How much time passed while I was
gone?

39:55.060 --> 39:59.665
- Uh, 60 minutes.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.634
- My watch says 58.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.503
What happened to the two
minutes?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.606
- Well, when did you set your
watch?

40:07.606 --> 40:09.675
- Right when I got there.

40:09.675 --> 40:13.178
- And when did you notice 58
minutes?

40:13.178 --> 40:15.146
- Right before I got sent back.

40:17.783 --> 40:21.186
- We forgot to calculate travel
time.

40:21.186 --> 40:25.924
It'll take you a minute to get there
and to get back.

40:25.924 --> 40:49.347
- Great. I already lost two
minutes.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.216
It was my call that distracted
her

40:51.216 --> 40:53.018
right before she stepped into the
intersection.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.522
- Blame her death on a phone
call?

40:56.522 --> 40:58.690
There are plenty of other things that
could've distracted her.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.059
- But there weren't.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.460
If I can stop myself from making
that call

41:02.460 --> 41:03.862
then maybe she won't get hit.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.263
- What about the car?

41:05.263 --> 41:06.898
How're you going to stop the
car?

41:06.898 --> 41:09.000
- I'll think of something.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.637
Prep the machine. I'm going
back.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.760
- Excuse me. Are you Connor?

42:08.760 --> 42:11.196
- Yeah.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.564
- You have a phone call in the
back.

42:12.564 --> 42:13.965
- From who?

42:13.965 --> 42:15.400
- From April.

42:15.400 --> 42:19.504
- Okay, thanks.

42:19.504 --> 42:21.573
Hello?

42:41.693 --> 42:47.933
- Hey,
hey, hey! Hey!

43:19.865 --> 43:21.266
The night she
was killed,

43:21.266 --> 43:31.877
she saw you kissing your
assistant.

43:31.877 --> 43:39.918
Now she's gone forever.

43:53.498 --> 43:55.466
- Yikes.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.902
- If I prevent the kiss from
happening

43:56.902 --> 43:58.503
April won't be upset.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.105
She'll continue to surprise me as
planned,

44:00.105 --> 44:02.874
and everything will work out.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.275
- Right. If we want to prevent
this from happening,

44:04.275 --> 44:06.611
you'll have to go back earlier.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.546
Which means you won't be able to see
how it turns out.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.649
- What if it won't matter?

44:11.649 --> 44:14.119
If this does work, none of this
would've happened.

44:14.119 --> 44:18.356
- That's right.

44:18.356 --> 44:22.360
- In that case,

44:22.360 --> 44:24.629
I want to thank you for
everything.

44:24.629 --> 44:28.333
You're a good friend.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.135
I couldn't have done it without
you.

44:30.135 --> 44:38.443
- See you in the past.

44:38.443 --> 44:42.080
- Jonas, I'm going to make sure
that this time I appreciate her.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.716
- Whatever will be wil be
Connor.

44:44.716 --> 44:47.518
- Fire it up.

45:07.405 --> 45:09.474
- Mr. Hughes, what're you doing out
this way?

45:09.474 --> 45:15.046
- Uh, I just went outside for a
smoke.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.982
I didn't want anyone to know.

45:16.982 --> 45:26.024
- Have a good night Mr. Hughes.

45:26.024 --> 45:28.359
- Let's celebrate.

45:28.359 --> 45:31.329
- I'd love to, but I can't. I've got
to meet April in an hour.

45:31.329 --> 45:40.005
I told her we'd pick a wedding
date.

45:53.084 --> 46:00.959
- Hello?

46:29.787 --> 46:35.593
- What? Jonas, what is it?

46:41.967 --> 46:44.302
- Get on the ground!

46:44.302 --> 46:46.071
No! Wait!

46:46.071 --> 46:47.472
- Back up!

46:48.874 --> 46:56.381
- Somebody help!

46:56.381 --> 46:58.984
- Try it again?

46:58.984 --> 47:02.187
- No matter what I do she still
dies.

47:02.187 --> 47:04.923
- Maybe it was just her time
Connor.

47:04.923 --> 47:06.724
- April wasn't supposed to die
that night.

47:06.724 --> 47:08.126
I know it.

47:08.126 --> 47:09.527
- We all have our fate Con.

47:09.527 --> 47:10.929
Maybe this was hers.

47:10.929 --> 47:12.330
- No, I can't accept that.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.132
Fire up the machine.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.800
- Eventually you're going to have
to accept it Connor.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.303
- Fire up the machine Jonas!

47:18.303 --> 47:20.838
- Maybe there's nothing you can
do to save her?

47:20.838 --> 47:22.707
Why don't you go home,

47:22.707 --> 47:28.513
get a good night's rest,
regroup, and

47:28.513 --> 47:30.848
you may want to keep trying.

47:30.848 --> 47:45.830
We can. As many times as you
want.

47:45.830 --> 48:01.346
Come on. I'll walk you home.

48:01.346 --> 48:08.586
- First time in my life I don't
know what to do.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.355
- It'll come to you.

48:10.355 --> 48:14.592
We'll figure something out.

48:14.592 --> 48:17.628
Damn!

48:17.628 --> 48:19.030
We got to get back the machine.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.698
- What?

48:20.698 --> 48:22.100
- Spencer and his men are here.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.501
Something must've happened

48:23.501 --> 48:27.472
the last time you went back.

48:27.472 --> 48:30.041
- What do I do when I get back
there?

48:30.041 --> 48:31.776
- Don't do anything.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.178
If there's nothing, things will
change

48:33.178 --> 48:36.114
back to the original outcome.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.515
- Wait, what are you going to
do?

48:37.515 --> 48:39.684
- Hold them off as long as
possible.

48:44.189 --> 48:45.556
- Search this entire place.

48:45.556 --> 49:15.453
I want whatever it is they're
hiding.

49:23.428 --> 49:25.296
- Nothing.

49:25.296 --> 49:28.733
- Well, they're definitely here.

49:28.733 --> 49:41.379
- They've got the power near.

49:41.379 --> 49:47.152
There it is.

49:47.152 --> 49:49.120
- You guys lost?

49:49.120 --> 49:51.089
- Where's Hughes?

49:51.089 --> 49:54.192
- Oh, he stepped out to pick up some
coffee.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.760
You want me have him get you a
cup?

49:55.760 --> 49:57.628
- Cut the shit.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.064
Where's the time machine?

49:59.064 --> 50:00.431
- Time machine?

50:00.431 --> 50:03.101
- Don't you toy with me old man.

50:03.101 --> 50:04.535
We know you built the time
machine.

50:04.535 --> 50:08.073
We just want to know where it
is.

50:08.073 --> 50:10.608
- Sir, I think I found it over
here.

50:10.608 --> 50:22.987
- Get the power back on.

50:22.987 --> 50:25.590
So how does it work?

50:25.590 --> 50:27.625
- Doesn't. Not finished with it
yet.

50:27.625 --> 50:29.026
- We already know Hughes has
been

50:29.026 --> 50:30.795
traveling back in time old
man.

50:30.795 --> 50:32.963
We saw him that night

50:32.963 --> 50:35.733
just before we shut you down.

50:35.733 --> 50:38.336
You see, we figured you'd continue
your research.

50:38.336 --> 50:41.106
So, we backed off, but you two think
that we haven't

50:41.106 --> 50:43.241
been watching you for the last year
and a half.

50:43.241 --> 50:44.642
So, I'm going to ask you again.

50:44.642 --> 50:46.211
How does this thing work?

50:46.211 --> 50:48.713
- Okay.

50:48.713 --> 50:51.816
We combine quantum mechanics with
the Relativity Theory

50:51.816 --> 50:55.420
to create a wormhole.

50:55.420 --> 51:00.425
Then we spin two magnets in reverse
to create an electromagnetic
induction.

51:00.425 --> 51:03.694
Then we add heavy bursts of
electricity

51:03.694 --> 51:07.732
to create the wormhole into which
we are able to catapult matter

51:07.732 --> 51:11.202
to create electromagnetic
velocity

51:11.202 --> 51:13.871
to get you to a specific point
in time.

51:13.871 --> 51:16.874
- Cut with the scientific crap,

51:16.874 --> 51:22.413
and just get to how I use it.

51:22.413 --> 51:27.118
- Can't. It's too late.

51:27.118 --> 51:28.553
- Boss, it's doing something.

51:28.553 --> 51:29.920
- Shut it down.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.356
- No!

51:47.138 --> 51:54.845
- Jonas!

51:54.845 --> 51:56.581
You all right?

51:56.581 --> 51:58.349
- Of course I'm alright.

51:58.349 --> 51:59.750
- I just saw you.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.186
- Whatever Connor.

52:01.186 --> 52:02.587
Whatever you just saw

52:02.587 --> 52:04.322
has all changed when you came
back.

52:04.322 --> 52:06.991
If something happened, it's all
fixed now.

52:06.991 --> 52:09.360
- Not everything.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.429
I still can't save her.

52:11.429 --> 52:15.466
- Connor, maybe you're going
about this all wrong.

52:15.466 --> 52:20.004
Maybe this machine wasn't built to
save her.

52:20.004 --> 52:23.541
Maybe this machine was built to give
you more time.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.843
- What do you mean?

52:25.843 --> 52:28.913
- I mean we're all given a certain
amount of time on this earth.

52:28.913 --> 52:32.082
Maybe you can't extend her time,

52:32.082 --> 52:35.853
but you have the ability to do
something

52:35.853 --> 52:37.888
that most people would give anything
for.

52:37.888 --> 52:39.990
Look at me.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.859
- What's that?

52:41.859 --> 52:45.430
- You have the ability to go
back,

52:45.430 --> 52:47.565
and spend 58 minutes at a time

52:47.565 --> 52:53.271
with a woman that you loved and
lost.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.540
You can create memories you never
had.

52:55.540 --> 53:00.545
You can experience things you never
got to.

53:00.545 --> 53:04.949
At the very least you get to hold her
one more time.

53:04.949 --> 53:10.087
If I were you, stop wasting time
trying to change

53:10.087 --> 53:13.258
the inevitable, and take
advantage

53:13.258 --> 53:35.179
of what I do have, 58 minutes at a
time.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.621
- Hey.

53:43.621 --> 53:46.056
- Hi.

53:46.056 --> 53:47.625
- What are you doing here?

53:47.625 --> 53:54.999
- I wanted to see you.

53:54.999 --> 53:57.502
Here, I got you something.

53:57.502 --> 54:01.105
- What's this?

54:01.105 --> 54:06.811
Wow. What's this for?

54:06.811 --> 54:14.051
- Well, this is old, and you need
a new one Connor.

54:14.051 --> 54:15.453
- Thanks.

54:15.453 --> 54:17.955
- What's the matter?

54:17.955 --> 54:19.624
You don't seem very excited to see
me.

54:19.624 --> 54:21.926
- No, no. I just didn't expect
you.

54:21.926 --> 54:23.661
- I spoke to my uncle today,

54:23.661 --> 54:26.631
and he said that whenever you're readypp

54:26.631 --> 54:29.334
We'd be working together again.

54:29.334 --> 54:30.901
- Yeah, yeah. That's great.

54:30.901 --> 54:44.482
- Come here.

54:44.482 --> 54:48.519
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

54:48.519 --> 54:50.120
- What's the matter?

54:50.120 --> 54:56.361
- I can't... I can't do this.

54:56.361 --> 55:06.303
This isn't working.

55:06.303 --> 55:12.477
- You're still not over her are
you?

55:12.477 --> 55:16.113
Connor, you need to move
on and let her go.

55:16.113 --> 55:21.285
It's been over a year already.

55:21.285 --> 55:23.020
No matter what you do, you can't
bring her back.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.155
- Maybe that's true.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.392
This. Us.
It's just...

55:27.392 --> 55:29.860
It's not working out.

55:29.860 --> 55:33.063
- So what are you trying to say?

55:33.063 --> 55:37.868
- I don't love you.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.504
- You know what Connor?

55:39.504 --> 56:02.259
I hope you're going to be happy on
your own.

56:02.259 --> 56:05.463
- Made a list of everything I would dopp

56:05.463 --> 56:10.167
Even if it's for only 58
minutes.

56:10.167 --> 56:12.637
- Glad you finally came around.

56:12.637 --> 56:14.472
- Before I do any of that,

56:14.472 --> 56:15.873
I have to go back one more time

56:15.873 --> 56:18.709
to right before she dies.

56:18.709 --> 56:22.312
- Why? There's nothing more you could
do back there.

56:22.312 --> 56:26.183
- I can't let her die in vain.

56:26.183 --> 56:30.788
I have to let her know how much she
means to me.

56:30.788 --> 56:38.529
If anything, at least I can leave
her with that.

56:38.529 --> 56:41.966
- You know, it's only going to
last...

56:41.966 --> 56:43.834
- I have to do this for me.

56:43.834 --> 56:47.171
And for her.

57:52.069 --> 57:54.004
- April!

57:54.004 --> 58:00.578
Just wait a second.

58:00.578 --> 58:03.814
April look, just give me a minute
alright?

58:03.814 --> 58:05.750
Let me apologize.

58:05.750 --> 58:07.284
- How did you even know where I
was?

58:07.284 --> 58:09.687
- It doesn't matter.

58:09.687 --> 58:11.088
Listen, I know why you're
upset

58:11.088 --> 58:12.489
and you have every right to be
okay.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.891
She just kissed me,

58:13.891 --> 58:15.292
and I didn't know what to do.

58:15.292 --> 58:16.694
So, I froze.

58:16.694 --> 58:18.362
- You froze?

58:18.362 --> 58:19.764
- Look, if you had just
waited...

58:19.764 --> 58:21.532
- Waited? For what?

58:21.532 --> 58:23.968
The rest of the show

58:23.968 --> 58:25.770
of my fiancee kissing someone
else?

58:25.770 --> 58:29.139
No wonder you're avoiding getting
married.

58:29.139 --> 58:31.008
- Avoiding... I'm not avoiding
getting married.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.077
Look, I was going to pick a date that
night.

58:33.077 --> 58:38.248
Tonight. Look, either way
I love you, okay?

58:38.248 --> 58:39.917
You're the only one I want to
be with,

58:39.917 --> 58:41.518
and you're the only person I care
about.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.822
And I just... I need you to
know that.

58:44.822 --> 58:47.424
- You should've thought of that
before.

58:47.424 --> 58:50.394
How you missed our anniversary.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.964
Were you with her?

58:53.964 --> 58:56.967
- No, no. Okay, she was there,

58:56.967 --> 58:58.402
but that has nothing to do
with...

58:58.402 --> 58:59.870
We were working April.

58:59.870 --> 59:02.306
April, just hear me out. Come
on.

59:02.306 --> 59:05.876
- I don't even know if you're
telling me the truth.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.344
- You know me April.

59:07.344 --> 59:11.015
- Do I?

59:11.015 --> 59:14.384
I don't think I can trust you
after this.

59:14.384 --> 59:16.053
I would've done anything for
you,

59:16.053 --> 59:17.622
and I am not about to let you

59:17.622 --> 59:19.023
take advantage of me,

59:19.023 --> 59:21.759
and make a fool out of me.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.360
- I'm sorry. You're you're
right.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.395
You're right. Listen, I shouldn't havepp

59:25.395 --> 59:28.198
escalate that far,

59:28.198 --> 59:35.873
but I'm here now because of you.

59:35.873 --> 59:38.242
- You had your chance.

59:38.242 --> 59:39.644
You two can have a each other.

59:39.644 --> 59:45.282
I'm done.

59:47.317 --> 59:50.054
Hello?

59:50.054 --> 59:51.421
- April! April!

59:51.421 --> 59:53.523
- What? Who is this?

59:53.523 --> 59:56.160
- April!

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.305
Something's wrong with the
machine.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:09.707
It sent me back two minutes
early.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:12.109
- I don't know.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.510
I did everything exactly the
same.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.913
- Okay, then what happened?

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.982
It sent me back before the 58
minutes was up.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:20.084
- Maybe you're losing time.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:21.485
- Losing time?

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:24.521
No, no. That's impossible.

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:25.923
- Nothing's impossible Connor.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.992
We've proved that.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:31.228
Nothing lasts forever.

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.898
- Then how much longer do I
have left?

01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:35.700
How much longer until I run out of
time?

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.101
- I don't know Connor.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:38.502
I'm the learning all this stuff

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:39.904
the same time you are.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:41.571
The only rational explanation...

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.107
Maybe you continue to lose time

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:56.754
until your window runs out.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:01:00.124
- What do I do?

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:04.461
I just can't win.

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:08.632
- If I were you Connor,

01:01:08.632 --> 01:01:11.969
I'd make the best of whatever
little time

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:14.671
I had left with her.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.073
- Easy for you to say Jonas.

01:01:16.073 --> 01:01:18.342
This is my life.

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.878
I can't just sit back and make
the best of it

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:22.880
knowing I might never get her
back.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.548
- You are never going to get her back
Connor.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.717
That's not the way it supposed
to be.

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:28.118
Fifty eight minutes at a time.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.586
That's all you get.

01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:33.057
Now you knew this moment would
come.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:36.493
You can either accept it and take
what you have,

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:40.464
or you can wallow in what might have
been.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:53.243
That's your decision Connor.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:01.886
- He didn't show did he?

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:03.487
- Nope.

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:14.331
- I'm very sorry.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:15.732
- You're leaving without me?

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.802
- You're late.

01:02:17.802 --> 01:02:25.843
- I made it over here.

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:28.112
- You want to get a glass of
champagne?

01:02:28.112 --> 01:02:29.479
- You know what?

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:44.494
Let's just do a bottle.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:48.332
- Connor? What are you doing
here?

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:49.900
I thought you had to work?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.069
- Some things are more
important.

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:45.609
- What are you doing?

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.911
- Setting the coordinates for my
next trip.

01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:49.313
- Connor, I thought that we
agreed

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:51.448
that the last time you did it.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.518
We need to shut this thing down.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.587
You are rapidly running out of
time,

01:05:57.587 --> 01:05:58.989
and we don't know what happens

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:00.390
if time runs out.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.392
- This is my last trip.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.028
I need to go back one more time.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:09.366
Say goodbye to April.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.802
- You know you're risking your own
life by going back again?

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:15.672
If time runs out so could you.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.274
- I know.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:45.835
- Hey!
What are you doing here?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.072
- Do you have a minute?

01:06:48.072 --> 01:06:51.775
- Yeah, my kids shouldn't be back
for a few minutes.

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:54.678
What's going on?

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:58.082
You never come here and
surprise me.

01:06:58.082 --> 01:06:59.583
- I wanted to see you.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:08.992
- Well, I'm glad you did.

01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:11.628
Is everything alright?

01:07:11.628 --> 01:07:15.165
It seems like something's wrong.

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:16.600
- No, everything's fine.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.136
Look, I just...

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:32.015
I just missed you that's all.

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:37.821
- God, I wish I could just skip class
and leave here with you.

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:41.425
What? What did I say?

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.792
- You trust me?

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.194
- What?

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:45.595
- Do you trust me?

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.197
- Well, of course.

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:49.133
Where's all this coming from?

01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:51.535
- Alright listen April,

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.137
no matter what happens I need you
to trust me.

01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:54.538
Okay? No matter how crazy it
sounds

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.039
I need you to believe me.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:57.441
- What are you talking...

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:05.249
It's my class. They'll be back
in...

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:07.984
Connor?

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:16.059
- How'd it go?

01:08:16.059 --> 01:09:00.470
- That was the last time. It's
over.

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:20.122
- Figured I'd find you here.

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:25.929
- I came to stop any wasting of
time.

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:31.868
- Did I ever tell you how I met my
wife?

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:33.670
I was a graduate student,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.939
and I was working on my thesis
project

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:41.010
in chemical engineering.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:46.082
Working with a highly
combustible substance.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:48.352
I was stressed, because it was the
night before

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:53.223
it was due, and I was worried I
wouldn't finish in time.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.592
I was working too fast, and I
uh,

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:59.996
made a careless mistake.

01:09:59.996 --> 01:10:03.733
The solution exploded in my
face.

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.168
And I was rushed to the
hospital.

01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:11.375
I met her in the ER,

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:14.444
and I'm in a great deal of pain,
and I'm terrified.

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:18.214
I might be permanent like this
for years.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:25.221
And this soft, nurturing voice
whispered,

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:29.926
"Everything will be fine."

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:33.630
So, I opened my eyes, and

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:37.434
I saw this most angelic face gazing
back at me.

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:40.304
And her smile alone was enough

01:10:40.304 --> 01:10:47.143
to convince me everything would be
okay.

01:10:47.143 --> 01:10:52.416
So, I vowed at that moment that I
would do everything I could,

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.351
anything necessary to keep
her in my life.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:59.289
Because I knew that to be
without her

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:12.836
would be more painful than anything
in the world.

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:14.871
A woman like that

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:18.742
only comes around once in a
lifetime.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:23.680
What you do is you do everything in
your power to keep her.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:33.657
So move your ass before I change
my mind.

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:37.561
When am I sending you back?

01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:40.930
July 20th, 1:20am.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:46.870
Three months before she died.

01:11:53.777 --> 01:11:55.244
- Connor?

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.814
- Go back to sleep.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.283
- Where are you going?

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:04.721
- I have some work to do at the
lab.

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:06.990
- This late?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.258
Are you going to come back to bed
after?

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:11.395
- Not tonight.

01:12:11.395 --> 01:12:13.730
Get some rest okay?

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:18.134
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.834
- Who the hell are you?

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:52.836
- Keep your voice down.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:13:00.043
You don't want to wake April.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.911
Put the pan down.

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:04.313
- Who are you?

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.749
- I'm you two years in the
future.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:08.552
- But how?

01:13:08.552 --> 01:13:09.953
- I need to tell you something
important,

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:11.521
but we don't have much time.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:13.957
The project you're working on

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:16.526
regarding time travel will
eventually work.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.361
In a few months you'll figure out
how to skip forward in time.

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:20.430
Don't get too close.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.865
I'm risking both our lives just by
being here.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:23.232
- How'd you get here?

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.634
- Just listen to me.

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:26.169
What I'm about to tell you

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:28.505
will change the rest of your
life.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:29.906
The project will be a success,

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.307
but the government will come in

01:13:31.307 --> 01:13:32.976
to shut it down anyway.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:36.079
That night, April is killed.

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:38.047
- What? How?

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:41.017
- She's hit by a car crossing an
intersection.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.886
None of that matters.

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:46.189
What matters is that you build that
machine,

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:49.926
and you send her past the exact
moment of her death.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.161
It is imperative that you follow
those directions precisely.

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.597
If you don't,

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:54.964
she'll continue in her fate,

01:13:54.964 --> 01:14:01.070
and you will lose her forever.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.807
- Reverse polar magnetism.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:05.675
- Everything you need to know is
in that book.

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:08.411
The rest is on the disc.

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:10.313
If she means as much as I know she
does to you...

01:14:10.313 --> 01:14:11.715
- Wait a second.

01:14:11.715 --> 01:14:13.617
- You'll do anything to save
her.

01:14:13.617 --> 01:14:15.018
- Wait a second. Wait.

01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:16.520
- Save her.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:48.985
- Wait!

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.254
- Morning.

01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:53.690
I see you canceled your class for the
day.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:59.228
Something the matter?

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.865
- If you had to tell me
something,

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:04.267
something so far-fetched

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.335
that you knew I wouldn't
believe.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.639
How would you do it?

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:14.678
- Well, I'd say we've been
friends a long time,

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:19.215
and if I was coming to you with
something

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.685
I thought was important,

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:24.020
no matter how outrageous,
I would hope

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.421
you would at least hear me out.

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:42.138
Why?

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.441
This is amazing. When did you write
this?

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:48.444
- Technically, I haven't yet.

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:50.814
- What?

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:55.652
- Last night I was visited
by... Me.

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:59.522
Not me, but me two years in the
future.

01:15:59.522 --> 01:16:02.058
I gave myself that book and a
disc,

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:04.127
and was told I have to build

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:06.796
this time machine in order to save
April.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:09.132
If I don't send her forward on this
day

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:11.367
at that exact time,

01:16:11.367 --> 01:16:13.703
she's going to die.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:17.807
- April will die? What are you
talking about?

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:22.779
- It's all in there.

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:25.181
- It's all in here right?

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:26.816
This is everything we've been
working on.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.252
My God, it says it actually
works.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.756
- So you believe me?

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:35.024
- A lot of this stuff in here
there's no way

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:37.426
you could've known this.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.630
There's stuff in here I
haven't told anybody.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.031
I've known you a lot of years.

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.432
You've never lied to me before.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.835
Why would you start now?

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.471
- Good, because I'm going to need
your help.

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:54.277
- Of course. There's a lot to do.
Let's get started.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.909
- Connor?

01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:28.544
- Hey Julia, what can I do for
you?

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:30.780
I was just wondering why you
decided

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.549
not to use me as your lab assistant
anymore?

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.451
Did I do something wrong?

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:38.221
- No, it's nothing you did.

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:40.356
It's just we're not pursuing that
project anymore.

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:42.759
But don't worry.

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:45.361
You'll get full credit for everything
you've done so far.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.330
- Connor, it wasn't about the
credit.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.699
Look, I really believe in what you're
doing.

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.134
Whatever you're working on now

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.136
I'd love to be a part of it.

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:55.371
- I appreciate that Julia,
I really do,

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:59.442
but this is just something we have
to pursue on our own.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:05.949
See you next week in class.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:57.801
- Spencer and his men are on
their way.

01:18:57.801 --> 01:19:16.853
Just don't let them see the time
machine.

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:20.756
Spencer, we weren't
expecting you.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.026
- Well, I just wanted to stop by
and check on you guys.

01:19:23.026 --> 01:19:26.429
See if any advancements have
been made.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:28.832
- Unfortunately there haven't
been.

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:30.566
To be honest, I'm beginning to
think

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.869
that my calculations are
preconceived.

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:38.041
- Well, that is unfortunate
Connor.

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.442
You know, we really did had high

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:51.554
hopes for you on this project.

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:54.757
- Uh, actually, we've made some
progress.

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:56.826
As a matter of fact, we're working
on a machine

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:59.562
right now that we think might be our
breakthrough.

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:03.166
- Really? I'd like to see it.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:04.567
- Of course.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:06.836
- Yeah, sure.

01:20:06.836 --> 01:20:09.572
Right now it's just a prototype.

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:12.275
The theory is that between the two
magnets

01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:14.677
we will be able to quantify
time.

01:20:14.677 --> 01:20:17.380
Anything that goes into
the machine

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.682
will be able to skip over a set
amount of time.

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:24.420
- Actually, gentlemen I don't
need to see it.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.555
I think that you're making great
progress.

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.958
Keep doing what you do,

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.995
and everything will be just
fine.

01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:33.396
I don't think we need to bother
these gentlemen anymore.

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:36.599
Let's go.

01:20:36.599 --> 01:20:43.706
- Gentlemen. Good day.

01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:45.441
- That was odd.

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:51.814
- Yeah, a little too close for
comfort.

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:53.682
Ran a few tests last night.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.084
Everything appeared to be
working.

01:20:55.084 --> 01:20:59.722
- Good.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:01.857
- You haven't told her yet have
you?

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:05.728
- Not yet.

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:07.931
- You know what you're going to say
to her?

01:21:07.931 --> 01:21:10.333
- What? Other than

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:11.734
"April, you're going to
die,

01:21:11.734 --> 01:21:13.602
and the only way to save you is

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.638
jump past your death in a time
machine"?

01:21:15.638 --> 01:21:18.541
- I'm sure you'll figure something
out.

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.110
- Yeah.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.612
Listen, I got to head to class.

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:26.615
- I'm going to run a few final tests
tonight.

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:29.152
Make sure the machine is prepped and
ready for tomorrow.

01:21:29.152 --> 01:21:38.061
- Thanks.

01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:42.365
Keep that in mind when using the
second derivative of...

01:21:42.365 --> 01:21:44.267
You know what? That's it for
today.

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.169
We'll take it from here next
week.

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:47.570
There's no test all right
guys?

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.005
Alright, thank you.

01:21:49.005 --> 01:21:50.406
- Do you have a moment?

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:51.807
I really need to talk to you.

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:53.209
- I don't right now Julia.

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:54.610
I'm actually in kind of a hurry.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:56.012
- Look, it's important.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.413
It'll only take a minute.

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:58.814
- Yeah, I wish I could.

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.216
I just really have to get going.

01:22:00.216 --> 01:22:01.617
Can it wait?

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:05.989
- Sure.

01:22:05.989 --> 01:22:15.965
- Thanks.

01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:29.045
- Hey.

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:31.614
- I need to talk to you about
something.

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:34.317
- Okay, what is it?

01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:37.186
- I need you to come tomorrow with
me somewhere.

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:38.587
- Where?

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:42.225
- I'll explain tomorrow.

01:22:42.225 --> 01:22:44.527
- What's going on?

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:48.331
- You're just going to have to
trust me.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.267
- I can't tomorrow.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:53.236
I have a PTA meeting.

01:22:53.236 --> 01:22:54.637
- Well, then you're going to have
to cancel it.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.040
This is important.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.441
- I can't just cancel my
meeting.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.842
It's been scheduled for days.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:02.211
- April. Please.

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:04.647
- Well, if it's that important

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.182
why can't you just tell me right
now?

01:23:09.352 --> 01:23:11.120
- Tomorrow night, you're...

01:23:18.861 --> 01:23:22.698
Jonas, yes.

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:25.868
No, I didn't take it.

01:23:25.868 --> 01:23:29.004
I'm coming right now.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.006
- Connor what's going on?

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.675
Tomorrow night I work.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.577
- Look, I got to go do
something.

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:35.978
I'll explain everything
tomorrow.

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:37.546
Just promise me that you will

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:40.015
be there tomorrow at 6:30.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:44.687
- Okay, I promise.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:46.089
Promise me everything's okay.

01:23:46.089 --> 01:23:48.491
- It will be.

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:51.660
- Connor, I have looked
everywhere.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.196
It's not... It's not around
here.

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:54.597
He must've taken it.

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:55.998
- Wait a minute Jonas.

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:58.401
We were here the entire time.

01:23:58.401 --> 01:24:01.304
- He must've slipped it out when we
weren't looking.

01:24:01.304 --> 01:24:03.706
He was standing by the computer

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.108
when you went to show him
Jupiter.

01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.942
He must've taken it then.

01:24:06.942 --> 01:24:08.344
- We gotta get that disc.

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:09.745
If he finds out what's on it,

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:11.147
he could ruin everything.

01:24:32.768 --> 01:24:34.237
- Milo.

01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:36.605
- Agent Spencer.

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:39.108
- I got a security disc on my
computer.

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:40.643
I need you to crack it and open up thepp

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.077
- Yes sir.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.995
- Did you get it?

01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:02.565
- Yeah. I replaced it with a
blank one.

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:58.754
- What are you doing still here?

01:25:58.754 --> 01:26:00.289
We gotta get moving.

01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:02.691
- Just double-checking to make

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:05.127
sure everything's working
alright.

01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:06.495
- No, I'll take care of things
here.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.897
You go get April.

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.299
- Okay, just keep an eye on these
readings alright?

01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:14.370
I'll be back soon.

01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:17.039
- They're definitely hiding
something in their plan.

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:19.642
Whatever was on that disc,

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:22.845
they definitely did not want me to
see it.

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:24.347
I suggest that we shut them down
sir

01:26:24.347 --> 01:26:27.550
before they can use it.

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:33.155
I'm on it.

01:26:33.155 --> 01:26:38.761
- Are you dressed?

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:49.272
We gotta go now.

01:26:49.272 --> 01:26:50.773
- Dear Connor,

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:53.175
I'm writing you this letter

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:55.110
because of the difficulty
to express

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.079
my feelings for you in person.

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:58.547
I'm sorry for whatever I did

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:00.883
that caused you to end things.

01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:02.285
But I ask you to please take me
back

01:27:02.285 --> 01:27:05.087
as I will not disappoint you.

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:11.994
Yours truly.

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:25.541
- Hey guys.

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:27.710
We're all set.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:32.247
What's going on? Where's April?

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.649
- I don't know.

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.351
She's not picking up her phone.

01:27:35.351 --> 01:27:38.354
- What?

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:42.057
How did you even get this?

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:45.027
- Julia must've slipped it into
my bag last night.

01:27:45.027 --> 01:27:46.962
It's all for nothing.

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:49.365
I have no idea where she is

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.500
and there's no time to get her into
the machine.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:58.307
- Connor. This is not over yet.

01:27:58.307 --> 01:28:03.111
We now where she's going.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.047
The intersection.

01:28:05.047 --> 01:28:07.450
You have 20 minutes.

01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:08.851
If we hurry, you can still get
there

01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:10.252
you can get there and
stop it before it happens.

01:28:10.252 --> 01:28:11.654
- How?

01:28:11.654 --> 01:28:13.055
After everything we've done

01:28:13.055 --> 01:28:14.457
it's like it's meant to happen.

01:28:14.457 --> 01:28:16.859
Jonas, there's nothing we can
do.

01:28:16.859 --> 01:28:18.260
- Connor, it hasn't actualy
happened yet.

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.662
If you hurry you can change it,

01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:21.063
but you gotta go now.

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:23.399
Go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:25.401
- You are not going anywhere.

01:28:25.401 --> 01:28:26.802
- You gotta let me go.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:29.204
I don't have time for this!

01:28:29.204 --> 01:28:30.606
- I know you're hiding something
here Connor,

01:28:30.606 --> 01:28:33.141
and I want it now.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.577
- Spencer you don't know what
you're doing.

01:28:34.577 --> 01:28:36.945
Just let me go.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:39.582
- I know that you stole the
disc,

01:28:39.582 --> 01:28:41.316
and that tells me that there is
something

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:42.718
very important on that disc that you
two

01:28:42.718 --> 01:28:44.119
do not want me to see.

01:28:44.119 --> 01:28:45.921
I want the disc back,

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:48.857
and I want whatever it is you've been
working on.

01:28:48.857 --> 01:28:50.292
- Spencer, you have no right to
barge in here with your thugs.

01:28:53.696 --> 01:28:56.799
- Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.

01:28:56.799 --> 01:29:00.035
I don't think you two actually
know who you're dealing with.

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:06.509
I want the disc, and I want it
now.

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:10.112
Alright. Tear this place
apart.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:12.648
We are going to find that disc
Connor

01:29:12.648 --> 01:29:14.617
if it takes us all day.

01:29:14.617 --> 01:29:20.155
- Wait, wait. We built the time
machine.

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:24.827
I'll show it to you if just let
Connor leave.

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:28.697
- He stays. You two aren't going
anywhere.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:52.054
Let's go. Show me the machine.

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:56.792
How does it work?

01:29:56.792 --> 01:30:05.167
- Why don't I fire it up,
and you can see for yourself.

01:30:14.877 --> 01:30:20.483
Run Connor!
Run, run, run!

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:03.565
You sure you're ready for this?

01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:03.999
I'm ready.
