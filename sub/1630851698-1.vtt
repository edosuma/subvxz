WEBVTT

00:29.496 --> 00:31.599
Go, go, go!

00:31.633 --> 00:33.066
Get up! Forwards!

01:12.205 --> 01:13.205
Forwards!

01:17.912 --> 01:20.515
Somewhere up there.

01:45.740 --> 01:46.908
Friendlies!

01:46.941 --> 01:47.875
Regiment four?

01:47.909 --> 01:50.377
Number three. Come along.

03:04.919 --> 03:05.919
Get up!

03:06.954 --> 03:07.954
On your feet!

03:08.856 --> 03:10.357
You're Latvians!

03:23.738 --> 03:24.738
Get up!

04:19.627 --> 04:21.028
Go back to sleep.

04:32.874 --> 04:35.576
Say hi to mom. I'll find father.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.899
Hide under the bed.

05:06.841 --> 05:07.841
Elbow.

05:12.180 --> 05:14.148
Hush, barons!

05:14.182 --> 05:19.352
May I come in?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.853
Milk?

06:03.998 --> 06:06.000
Good.

06:13.908 --> 06:15.643
Thank you.

06:21.916 --> 06:23.416
What is happening?

06:29.023 --> 06:31.692
Hush, barons! Hush!

06:37.064 --> 06:38.465
Don't shoot!

06:38.498 --> 06:41.401
Worked here before the war.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.403
Spies!

06:44.138 --> 06:45.139
Don't shoot!

06:45.172 --> 06:46.941
Silence!

06:50.645 --> 06:53.547
Move, Russian!

06:53.581 --> 06:55.149
Down, boy!

06:58.252 --> 07:01.923
They were hiding in a barn!

07:01.956 --> 07:03.658
We are not soldiers.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.926
I don't know.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.928
Restrain the dog!

07:06.961 --> 07:09.730
Barons, hush! Barons, hush!

07:09.764 --> 07:11.666
Restrain the dog!

07:11.699 --> 07:14.467
Hush, barons!

07:19.774 --> 07:21.042
What are you doing?

07:21.075 --> 07:22.543
Arrest them!

07:26.981 --> 07:28.582
Arrest them!

08:52.233 --> 08:54.068
It's not your fault.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.818
Come on, hurry up!

09:10.851 --> 09:13.254
The Germans are close
to jelgava already.

09:13.287 --> 09:14.922
Burn everything!

09:14.955 --> 09:18.025
Don't leave the cattle
for the Germans.

09:30.371 --> 09:32.907
May I take my mother's ring?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.041
Yes.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.161
Will we burn the house?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.631
Let them burn it, if they want.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.734
The cattle will
not make till Riga.

12:05.259 --> 12:06.259
Next!

12:09.797 --> 12:14.101
Next!

12:14.134 --> 12:15.134
Go, next!

12:21.942 --> 12:24.011
Too young. Next!

12:24.044 --> 12:25.479
He's got my permission.

12:27.549 --> 12:28.415
Are you his father?

12:28.449 --> 12:30.050
Yes.

12:30.084 --> 12:31.885
In two months, I'll be 17.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.489
Mother's permission?

12:37.258 --> 12:39.393
She was shot by the Germans.

12:46.834 --> 12:47.834
Next!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.445
Too old.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.519
Give my documents
to the commander.

13:26.641 --> 13:30.177
The sargent major
of kexholm regiment.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.210
Exactly.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.051
17 distinctions for
outstanding shooting skills.

13:38.986 --> 13:39.986
Correct.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.424
Served for 15 years.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
Sign him up.

14:22.396 --> 14:25.399
♪ God bless Latvia ♪

14:25.432 --> 14:26.367

14:26.400 --> 14:28.369

14:28.402 --> 14:31.038

only Latvians here.

14:31.071 --> 14:36.076

15:10.745 --> 15:12.346
Forward in a chain.

15:13.681 --> 15:15.349
Pew! Chu-chu, pew!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.136
Arturs, watch out!

15:36.170 --> 15:37.170
Poof!

15:45.713 --> 15:46.713
Arturs!

15:51.586 --> 15:56.591
Vanags, spilva, half an
hour in slope arms position.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.025
Why?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.058
An hour.

16:01.495 --> 16:02.996
In marching position!

16:10.839 --> 16:13.106
Present arms! Take!

16:13.140 --> 16:14.408
Attack! Go!

16:17.144 --> 16:18.813
A soldier must not think.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.248
Reload, aim and
shoot. Understood?

16:27.187 --> 16:30.023
Did your father drill
you like that at home too?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.826
No.

16:31.860 --> 16:36.063
At home he was just dad,
not a sergeant major.

16:36.831 --> 16:38.365
Load, aim, shoot!

16:39.366 --> 16:42.169
Forwards! Faster!

16:46.173 --> 16:50.043
What are you doing?! A
soldier mustn't think.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.078
Forwards!

16:52.514 --> 16:54.214
Impressive, konrads.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.620
A real acrobat.

17:00.588 --> 17:02.022
But how hard is it really?

17:07.327 --> 17:08.730
Run, mikelsons!

17:13.300 --> 17:15.135
Come on, you Riga moron!

17:16.838 --> 17:18.438
Let's see how hard you are.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.115
Is that ours?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.120
You can tell by the
sound that it's ours.

17:34.589 --> 17:37.357
I think.

17:37.391 --> 17:38.292
Run for cover!

17:38.325 --> 17:40.160
All of you! Hide!

17:43.665 --> 17:46.333
Everyone run for cover! A plane!

17:49.637 --> 17:51.371
Faster, faster! Hide!

18:37.619 --> 18:38.886
These are too small for me.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.557
Report that you can't go to war.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.726
Yeah, right. They
will fit without socks.

18:47.829 --> 18:48.830
Mikelsons.

18:50.898 --> 18:51.899
Spilva.

18:56.638 --> 18:57.638
Vanags.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.274
Vanags.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.700
Soldiers!

19:28.435 --> 19:33.440
Today you made an oath to
the tsar and the fatherland!

19:34.609 --> 19:37.477
Be faithful to it and
don't spare your lives!

19:38.913 --> 19:41.916
Listen to the command!
Lieutenant apsitis-

19:43.051 --> 19:44.719
- a real hero.

19:44.752 --> 19:49.757
Riflemen. It's 40
kilometers till the frontline.

19:51.793 --> 19:54.762
In seven hours, we'll
be there. Oorah!

19:55.963 --> 19:58.866
Oorah, oorah, oorah!

20:01.703 --> 20:05.338
With a song, quick march!

20:41.109 --> 20:45.513
"They will fit
without socks." What a jerk.

20:46.981 --> 20:49.650
Can you keep it down?

20:49.684 --> 20:51.919
Did you come here to sleep?

20:53.888 --> 20:55.890
The little boy has a blister?

20:56.991 --> 20:57.991
Shut up.

21:12.874 --> 21:13.941
Are you nuts?

21:18.880 --> 21:21.883
Miss frau.

21:24.018 --> 21:25.052
A rat race!

21:29.557 --> 21:30.557
Hush!

21:32.894 --> 21:33.928
Guys, do you hear it?

21:41.702 --> 21:43.004
Spilva!

21:43.037 --> 21:44.772
Go gas the Germans!

22:27.548 --> 22:29.984
A medic! A medic!

22:37.625 --> 22:39.459
Attach the bayonets!

22:48.102 --> 22:51.172
I said, attach the bayonets!

22:51.205 --> 22:52.573
Everyone to the parapet!

22:57.245 --> 23:01.015
If we don't respond, they
will start firing even more.

23:31.979 --> 23:33.681
Are you blind?

23:33.714 --> 23:34.949
As if you can see anything.

23:34.982 --> 23:35.982
Hold your fire!

23:37.985 --> 23:40.521
Get ready for the attack.

23:41.822 --> 23:42.990
Form a single line.

23:48.562 --> 23:49.562
Back!

23:52.066 --> 23:53.066
We wait.

23:56.070 --> 23:57.705
Load your weapons.

25:20.121 --> 25:23.758
Vanags, we must go that way.

25:27.728 --> 25:30.965
Arturs! Had you gone home?

25:55.089 --> 25:57.291
Leave him. We can't help him.

25:58.859 --> 26:01.695
The fog is clearing. They
will wipe us all out.

26:01.729 --> 26:02.730
Move forwards.

26:27.121 --> 26:29.023
Grenades!

26:31.092 --> 26:32.092
Go!

27:57.077 --> 27:58.779
Perhaps mirdza?

27:58.812 --> 28:00.481
Show it to me too, mikelsons.

28:04.018 --> 28:05.386
Just bless yourself.

28:09.558 --> 28:11.125
Finally, some tits.

28:16.497 --> 28:18.899
You should go to the infirmary.

28:18.933 --> 28:19.933
I'll stay.

28:37.284 --> 28:38.786
Stop stealing.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.989
I'm not. Just
airing the pockets.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.861
And where did you
get the boots, huh?

28:49.029 --> 28:52.366
With these boots the
fighting will be much easier.

29:37.478 --> 29:38.479
216?

29:41.915 --> 29:43.083
9281.

29:43.117 --> 29:44.117
Vanags.

29:48.989 --> 29:51.526
Spilva, killed in sloka.

30:52.353 --> 30:56.957
Mom!

31:59.119 --> 32:00.688
Clean them properly.

32:01.488 --> 32:02.956
Make them look like new.

32:07.094 --> 32:08.495
Is that my blood?

32:09.396 --> 32:11.699
Germans have blue. It's yours.

32:14.502 --> 32:16.370
And Estonians?

32:16.403 --> 32:17.403
Fiery.

32:24.011 --> 32:25.011
Attention!

32:27.782 --> 32:29.717
The unit stays
in reserve tonight.

32:29.751 --> 32:31.218
Copy that!

32:31.251 --> 32:33.387
Arturs vanags will be at
the sergeant's disposal.

32:35.590 --> 32:36.624
Rifleman vanags!

32:36.658 --> 32:37.658
Here!

32:40.427 --> 32:41.427
Happy birthday!

32:44.465 --> 32:45.465
Thank you.

32:48.135 --> 32:49.737
At ease.

32:49.771 --> 32:51.606
The boy has turned 17.

33:00.147 --> 33:01.147
Yes, yes.

33:02.851 --> 33:04.284
Crowds are everywhere.

33:05.687 --> 33:06.654
Let's leave.

33:06.688 --> 33:07.688
Come.

33:18.800 --> 33:19.567
Go away!

33:19.601 --> 33:21.603
Come on, lolya.

33:34.649 --> 33:38.485
♪ Lolya, sweetie, my sunshine ♪

33:42.089 --> 33:44.659
Can two soldiers rest here?

33:44.692 --> 33:45.860
Edgars.

33:45.894 --> 33:49.797
And arturs and a
bottle of tokay wine.

33:52.499 --> 33:54.836
And a present from the trenches.

33:54.869 --> 33:57.104
I hate white wine.

33:57.137 --> 33:58.138
We hate it too.

34:00.909 --> 34:02.844
Arturs saw a plane.

34:06.915 --> 34:08.081
Olya.

34:09.349 --> 34:10.183
Arturs.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.217
Well.

34:25.667 --> 34:30.672
So, here you go. Here you go.

34:31.539 --> 34:32.807
Do you want to get us drunk?

34:32.840 --> 34:34.074
Yes, I do.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.544
So be it! Let's get drunk!

34:36.578 --> 34:38.278
There's war, after all.

34:38.312 --> 34:40.414
And war. So be it!

34:40.447 --> 34:41.447
Bottoms up.

34:50.825 --> 34:52.326
That is my sword.

34:52.359 --> 34:53.359
Really?

34:54.629 --> 34:56.564
Where have you been
with your sword?

34:56.598 --> 34:58.365
Why is your brother so serious?

35:00.635 --> 35:02.135
Ask him. Go on.

35:03.905 --> 35:05.372
And why don't you laugh?

35:06.574 --> 35:07.809
Ha, ha, ha.

35:08.843 --> 35:10.511
I like you in uniform.

35:11.913 --> 35:13.347
Can I try on your hat?

35:23.992 --> 35:25.593
How should I salute an officer?

35:26.861 --> 35:28.128
Sir, private reporting!

35:29.597 --> 35:30.832
Sir, private reporting!

35:33.433 --> 35:35.937
If I give you an
order, will you do it?

35:36.904 --> 35:37.904
Yes.

35:40.374 --> 35:41.374
Kiss me.

36:00.895 --> 36:03.497
Should have dug the boxes
of seeds deeper at home.

36:04.364 --> 36:06.266
Everything grows spoiled.

36:06.299 --> 36:08.503
There will be nothing to sow.

36:08.536 --> 36:10.505
But here we are,
thousands of us,

36:10.538 --> 36:11.939
sitting here and doing nothing.

36:13.574 --> 36:15.877
We could plough a
square verst per day.

36:16.878 --> 36:18.713
Wait for the orders, soldier.

36:18.746 --> 36:20.213
We'll have a chance to fight.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.556
To the cellar.

36:36.363 --> 36:38.566
Put the cap on the
bayonet and lift it up.

36:39.701 --> 36:40.701
Give it to me.

36:47.608 --> 36:48.876
Lower, not so high.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.347
Lift it up and down,
as if he was walking.

36:56.383 --> 37:00.287
Not jumping. It's not a dance.

37:02.489 --> 37:03.489
Slower.

37:05.626 --> 37:07.762
You are as dumb as a rock.

37:07.795 --> 37:08.930
Stop teaching me.

37:10.932 --> 37:12.734
How can I, stupid?

37:12.767 --> 37:14.869
Acting like a professor.

37:17.337 --> 37:20.908
A sniper. Any volunteers?

37:27.515 --> 37:28.515
Very well.

37:29.517 --> 37:32.452
A sniper. Post to the right.

37:37.058 --> 37:38.993
Two go forwards. Lay low.

38:49.797 --> 38:51.032
Arturs, go, go!

39:21.896 --> 39:25.566
For being so weak,
you deserve a tribunal.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.125
My boy.

39:55.563 --> 39:56.563
My boy.

40:00.935 --> 40:02.036
What are you doing?

40:02.069 --> 40:06.674
He's got a bullet in his
neck, but you give him milk.

40:31.699 --> 40:32.867
Don't talk.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.970
A bullet was removed from
your neck, do you understand?

40:36.871 --> 40:38.239
It had gone through the shoulder

40:38.272 --> 40:39.974
two millimeters from the artery.

40:41.042 --> 40:42.042
You were lucky.

40:44.946 --> 40:47.882
Hush. Dear boy.

40:48.950 --> 40:50.017
Still a boy.

40:51.953 --> 40:53.453
War is not for boys.

40:54.989 --> 40:59.627
Should have stayed home
with your mom, studying.

41:07.902 --> 41:09.570
Dear son,

41:09.603 --> 41:10.972
my feet are hurting.

41:11.005 --> 41:13.574
I heard that you had
fallen in the battle.

41:14.575 --> 41:16.610
But I know, that you are alive.

41:18.045 --> 41:20.581
There is no news.
The front is quiet.

41:21.882 --> 41:23.818
Konrads strangled another one,

41:23.851 --> 41:26.921
and I managed to shoot
two more bastards.

41:26.954 --> 41:28.656
That makes 30 altogether.

41:31.559 --> 41:34.695
It is cold as hell here,
my bones are aching,

41:36.263 --> 41:39.900
but when I think about
you and edgars, and home,

41:39.934 --> 41:41.602
I forget about the pain.

41:43.771 --> 41:45.840
Mother talked about
you in my dream.

41:48.709 --> 41:51.112
Edgars had already come
home, but freezing.

41:57.985 --> 42:00.021
You are strictly
forbidden to smoke.

42:14.835 --> 42:15.835
True. I'm sorry.

42:17.938 --> 42:19.106
You should't talk either.

42:28.649 --> 42:30.785
Visiting hours
are over in an hour.

42:49.970 --> 42:52.807
Get plump and
healthy as a horse.

42:54.208 --> 42:55.342
Greetings from olya.

42:57.244 --> 42:58.345
Well, how are they?

43:00.881 --> 43:01.881
Drinking.

43:03.684 --> 43:04.819
How is father doing?

43:08.222 --> 43:10.057
Crawling closer to the Germans.

43:11.025 --> 43:12.159
Shooting every day.

43:14.428 --> 43:16.997
He got a message that you
were killed in battle.

43:18.332 --> 43:19.900
But I'm alive.

43:22.703 --> 43:25.139
Well, it's a good sign.

43:25.172 --> 43:27.741
What do you think
about this, officer?

43:27.775 --> 43:30.010
While kaiser is having
children for breakfast,

43:30.044 --> 43:31.645
behind the front,

43:31.679 --> 43:34.115
German spies have recruited
murderers of bolsheviks,

43:34.148 --> 43:37.118
promising land and money
that does not belong to them.

43:37.151 --> 43:39.153
The tsar is ready
to die for you.

43:40.788 --> 43:42.591
Let's not give in to propaganda.

43:47.895 --> 43:49.096
Check if these are yours.

43:56.337 --> 43:57.371
It's mine.

43:58.939 --> 44:01.375
I guess you'll be going
to the island of death.

44:07.516 --> 44:08.516
Play one.

44:09.984 --> 44:11.919
Let's play. See this?

44:31.205 --> 44:34.041
I'm sorry for smoking.

44:34.074 --> 44:36.143
Once healed, you'll
be able to smoke again.

44:37.912 --> 44:39.380
My name is arturs.

44:39.413 --> 44:40.413
I know.

44:42.249 --> 44:44.018
Why are you here
at the hospital?

44:45.786 --> 44:48.022
My father and brother
are in the front.

44:48.055 --> 44:50.257
And I cannot look after
our farmstead alone.

44:51.892 --> 44:53.770
My father and I decided, it
is best for me to come here.

44:53.794 --> 44:56.096
What about your mother?

44:56.130 --> 44:57.130
My mother died.

44:58.499 --> 44:59.501
I'm sorry.

45:14.081 --> 45:15.081
Shall we dance?

45:32.032 --> 45:33.032
My name is marta.

45:53.087 --> 45:55.557
The kraut soldier was
put there for punishment.

45:57.559 --> 45:59.393
The Germans have no guts.

46:01.962 --> 46:06.066
They want us to waste
bullets on their jerks.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.002
It's a piece of cake.

46:08.035 --> 46:09.035
Stop.

46:09.638 --> 46:11.438
Why do you pity him?

46:11.472 --> 46:12.840
Perhaps, he shot spilva.

46:14.041 --> 46:16.343
Perhaps, he put a bullet in
the heart of arturs' mother.

46:16.377 --> 46:17.978
We're not executioners.

46:18.012 --> 46:20.080
He'll get shot
tomorrow in the battle.

46:24.285 --> 46:27.221
German asses! Bang bang!

46:27.254 --> 46:28.254
Come here!

46:42.936 --> 46:46.608
Yes, yes! Shit!

46:46.641 --> 46:50.044
I am not shit! You are shit!

46:53.147 --> 46:56.150
Yes, yes! I don't understand!

46:56.183 --> 46:58.218
I am Latvian!

46:59.420 --> 47:00.622
You are a farmer!

47:00.655 --> 47:03.223
You are an ass!

47:08.962 --> 47:10.130
Stop shouting.

47:31.919 --> 47:32.919
Father.

48:13.994 --> 48:15.095
Kill him.

48:26.473 --> 48:27.473
Shoot!

48:35.750 --> 48:37.017
It's wrong.

48:38.753 --> 48:39.753
Shoot.

48:47.595 --> 48:50.197
Bravo, Latvians! Bravo.

48:52.099 --> 48:53.501
If your mother was here...

49:00.742 --> 49:03.645
I hope she can forgive me
for taking you to the war.

49:10.184 --> 49:11.051
How many?

49:11.084 --> 49:12.052
What?

49:12.085 --> 49:13.954
How many?

49:16.089 --> 49:18.225
It should be 60 by
the end of summer.

49:26.601 --> 49:28.402
Gas attack!

49:28.435 --> 49:30.772
Put wet cloths on your face!

49:32.507 --> 49:34.509
Faster, faster! Come on!

49:36.578 --> 49:39.112
Help the 6th battalion!

49:43.150 --> 49:47.087
Friendly
troops! Friendly troops!

49:53.561 --> 49:55.062
Edgars!

49:56.296 --> 50:01.301
Arturs!

50:02.670 --> 50:03.705
Where is father?

50:03.738 --> 50:04.739
What?

50:04.772 --> 50:07.040
Where is father?

50:50.852 --> 50:52.720
They are real devils.

50:54.656 --> 50:55.656
Sons of bitches.

50:56.691 --> 50:58.458
They keep on censoring letters.

50:59.694 --> 51:00.905
It's so you don't
spoil your eyesight,

51:00.929 --> 51:02.597
reading so many letters.

51:02.630 --> 51:05.165
But I can't see shit of
what my sweetheart writes.

51:08.570 --> 51:09.570
Dick heads.

51:12.139 --> 51:13.240
Attention!

51:18.613 --> 51:20.748
Vanags didn't come
for replacement.

51:20.782 --> 51:22.482
Do you know where he is?

53:15.930 --> 53:18.298
Lieutenant vanags!

53:18.331 --> 53:19.667
Here.

53:21.268 --> 53:22.904
Who put the gun in the grave?

53:22.937 --> 53:23.905
Commander...

53:23.938 --> 53:25.540
Dismissed!

53:25.573 --> 53:26.573
It was me. I did.

53:28.543 --> 53:30.444
Losing a gun means tribunal!

53:31.846 --> 53:34.716
Commander, sergeant major vanags

53:34.749 --> 53:37.852
killed 56 Germans with this gun.

53:37.885 --> 53:40.688
He deserves to be
buried with it.

54:02.744 --> 54:03.911
You did right.

54:06.647 --> 54:07.647
Fire.

54:34.609 --> 54:35.843
Latvian riflemen.

54:37.344 --> 54:41.048
You will succeed in
attacking the Germans.

54:41.082 --> 54:43.985
You are lucky to fight together

54:44.018 --> 54:48.355
with the best siberian
units of the 12th regiment.

54:49.056 --> 54:50.357
With your bayonets

54:50.390 --> 54:52.425
we will liberate jelgava and.

54:53.761 --> 54:55.930
Mothers and fathers
are waiting for you.

54:56.998 --> 54:59.100
You will embrace them
after the victory.

55:00.968 --> 55:02.469
God be with us.

55:04.906 --> 55:06.473
Volunteers step forward!

55:15.550 --> 55:17.450
You'll report the
route to the others.

55:27.695 --> 55:29.697
The tsar promised
that we'll get home.

55:31.464 --> 55:32.567
Godspeed, boys!

55:35.203 --> 55:36.203
At ease!

55:37.605 --> 55:41.008
You'll get fed. This
is for special occasions.

55:41.042 --> 55:42.119
Could I have some bacon, please?

55:42.143 --> 55:43.945
Perhaps, you want boar's balls?

55:45.580 --> 55:47.915
Hey, this is for three days.

55:47.949 --> 55:49.550
What's in my stomach is mine.

55:49.584 --> 55:51.853
If I get shot, at least
Germans won't get it.

55:53.020 --> 55:55.890
Are you stupid?
What are you doing?

55:55.923 --> 55:57.091
Volunteers?

55:57.124 --> 55:58.869
I'll take you off the front
line to join the signallers.

55:58.893 --> 56:00.928
Maybe also
give me a candlestick?

56:06.934 --> 56:09.537
Alright. I'll go with you.

56:10.204 --> 56:11.204
Come.

58:33.581 --> 58:35.850
Alarm! Alarm!

58:38.119 --> 58:39.720
Fire!

58:39.754 --> 58:40.754
Petersons.

58:43.657 --> 58:44.657
Petersons!

59:16.724 --> 59:17.792
Go, go, go!

1:00:36.437 --> 1:00:38.105
Give me your hand.

1:01:22.016 --> 1:01:24.785
You wanted to shoot me?!

1:01:32.092 --> 1:01:33.761
Arturs, grenade!

1:01:55.082 --> 1:01:56.116
Kill me, please, kill me.

1:02:45.499 --> 1:02:46.900
How are they?

1:02:48.135 --> 1:02:49.135
Good.

1:03:08.322 --> 1:03:09.524
It should be done.

1:03:09.557 --> 1:03:10.958
It's been cooking
for three hours!

1:03:12.259 --> 1:03:13.259
Add some wood.

1:03:14.495 --> 1:03:16.430
Then it will boil faster.

1:03:17.965 --> 1:03:19.300
Number three? Yes?

1:03:20.968 --> 1:03:22.803
Distribute it to your folks.

1:03:25.039 --> 1:03:26.974
It's lice powder.

1:03:27.007 --> 1:03:28.007
Shut up!

1:03:30.978 --> 1:03:31.978
It's salt!

1:03:32.681 --> 1:03:33.581
Lice powder!

1:03:33.615 --> 1:03:34.982
It's salt!

1:03:35.015 --> 1:03:37.151
It is lice powder he says.

1:03:37.184 --> 1:03:37.985
Why are you laughing?

1:03:38.018 --> 1:03:39.053
Let's take it off.

1:03:41.055 --> 1:03:42.122
What's happening here?

1:03:43.924 --> 1:03:46.060
Permission to report, captain,

1:03:46.093 --> 1:03:48.462
the Estonian can't cook a goose.

1:03:50.097 --> 1:03:51.398
What?

1:03:51.432 --> 1:03:53.100
Yes, your highness.

1:03:53.133 --> 1:03:54.368
On behalf of our company,

1:03:55.936 --> 1:03:58.172
we invite you to share
this goose with us.

1:04:01.408 --> 1:04:03.043
Well, if you treat me.

1:04:04.044 --> 1:04:05.045
Right.

1:04:05.079 --> 1:04:06.313
Here you go.

1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:23.430
Slowly, slowly. Who
said, the Estonian can't cook?

1:04:48.989 --> 1:04:49.624
A parcel.

1:04:49.657 --> 1:04:51.024
For whom?

1:04:51.058 --> 1:04:52.393
For Petersons.

1:04:52.426 --> 1:04:53.894
Check if there is food.

1:04:55.129 --> 1:04:56.129
It's from his mom.

1:04:57.766 --> 1:04:58.766
Read it.

1:05:09.009 --> 1:05:10.010
"My dearest boy!"

1:05:11.445 --> 1:05:13.414
I received the money and
even your previous letter

1:05:13.447 --> 1:05:14.592
that seemed to have been lost.

1:05:14.616 --> 1:05:16.984
Now, I have some wool.

1:05:19.687 --> 1:05:21.955
I will knit mittens
for your friends too.

1:05:25.092 --> 1:05:28.028
When my heart gets
sad and full of fear,

1:05:28.061 --> 1:05:30.130
especially in the dark evenings,

1:05:31.999 --> 1:05:34.001
I light a lamp by the bedside

1:05:34.034 --> 1:05:37.171
and look at my dearest,

1:05:40.274 --> 1:05:41.576
dearest boy's face.

1:05:44.612 --> 1:05:49.016
And then I feel at ease and
remember the good times,

1:05:51.318 --> 1:05:55.088
"when we were all
together and happy."

1:05:59.460 --> 1:06:00.762
Smoke got in my eyes.

1:06:02.530 --> 1:06:07.535
"Every evening, I pray for my
boy to return safe and sound."

1:06:11.506 --> 1:06:13.240
Kisses to my little boy.

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:16.042
"Your mommy."

1:06:17.144 --> 1:06:18.144
Gather your things!

1:06:21.081 --> 1:06:24.117
We are returning to
the previous positions.

1:06:24.151 --> 1:06:27.321
Why? The siberians should
be in jelgava already.

1:06:28.489 --> 1:06:32.527
It's an order to me
and so it is to you.

1:06:34.094 --> 1:06:37.097
The orders are not
to be questioned.

1:07:14.167 --> 1:07:18.673
Where are the reinforcements?
Where are the siberians?

1:07:22.476 --> 1:07:24.512
Movement is impossible.

1:07:24.546 --> 1:07:26.714
I repeat,

1:07:26.748 --> 1:07:28.683
movement is impossible.

1:07:32.687 --> 1:07:34.756
We are under attack.

1:07:38.292 --> 1:07:39.292
Understood!

1:07:44.498 --> 1:07:46.501
At night, we pull back.

1:07:48.201 --> 1:07:50.672
The siberians refused to attack.

1:07:50.705 --> 1:07:52.540
But we are so close.

1:07:52.574 --> 1:07:55.242
It'll be fine. We'll get home.

1:08:06.955 --> 1:08:08.221
Lower! Lower!

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:35.382
Brother. Brother!

1:09:10.685 --> 1:09:11.853
Wait.

1:09:13.588 --> 1:09:14.588
Wait!

1:09:26.668 --> 1:09:27.668
Fire!

1:09:46.054 --> 1:09:47.622
Everyone retreat!

1:09:48.623 --> 1:09:49.623
Retreat!

1:10:56.023 --> 1:10:58.492
Jekabs? Jekabs?

1:10:58.526 --> 1:10:59.493
Killed.

1:10:59.527 --> 1:11:00.995
Alberts?

1:11:08.368 --> 1:11:10.337
Have you seen pukis?

1:11:10.370 --> 1:11:11.706
No, I haven't.

1:11:12.907 --> 1:11:14.909
Has anyone seen rudzitis?

1:11:14.942 --> 1:11:17.912
Has anyone seen mukins?

1:11:48.910 --> 1:11:50.111
Out of my way.

1:11:55.917 --> 1:11:59.587
Why didn't you come help us?

1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:02.657
Read it yourself.

1:12:06.761 --> 1:12:11.732
The war will bring the
end to the tsar and kaiser.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.605
Point your weapons towards
ministers and generals.

1:12:18.940 --> 1:12:23.010
Lenin has promised
to liberate Russia,

1:12:24.946 --> 1:12:28.481
let us liberate Russia
and return home.

1:12:28.516 --> 1:12:29.884
Land - to the peasants!

1:12:31.752 --> 1:12:32.854
Put an end to the war!

1:12:33.921 --> 1:12:35.857
And do you believe them?

1:12:35.890 --> 1:12:37.692
What else can we do?

1:12:37.725 --> 1:12:39.994
I will not fight for
this damn tsar anymore.

1:12:42.096 --> 1:12:42.997
Do you think that Lenin

1:12:43.030 --> 1:12:44.464
will really Grant us freedom?

1:12:46.868 --> 1:12:47.868
We'll see.

1:13:06.988 --> 1:13:07.988
Marta?

1:13:15.796 --> 1:13:18.966
My father. He didn't come back.

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.201
What is his name?

1:13:21.936 --> 1:13:24.205
Peteris feldzers.

1:13:24.238 --> 1:13:25.973
Brother?

1:13:26.007 --> 1:13:27.942
He was killed on
the island of death.

1:13:31.012 --> 1:13:33.748
If I find out something,
I will write to you.

1:13:54.802 --> 1:13:55.903
Does it hurt?

1:13:58.005 --> 1:13:59.005
What?

1:14:02.643 --> 1:14:03.643
A little.

1:14:18.859 --> 1:14:22.563
Marta, the revolution is over.

1:14:22.596 --> 1:14:24.665
The tsar and kaiser
have been punished.

1:14:24.699 --> 1:14:26.634
For two months, we
were guarding Lenin.

1:14:28.002 --> 1:14:29.837
Then, we were sent to the south.

1:14:29.870 --> 1:14:32.106
I was wounded in the
leg not far from rostov.

1:14:33.307 --> 1:14:35.609
Mikelsons and konrads
carried me to hospital

1:14:35.643 --> 1:14:37.278
for 20 kilometers.

1:14:37.311 --> 1:14:39.814
At first, the doctor
wanted to cut the leg off,

1:14:39.847 --> 1:14:41.048
but then decided not to.

1:14:42.283 --> 1:14:45.019
I don't want to return
home as a disabled person.

1:14:45.052 --> 1:14:47.321
My comrades are being
sent back to Latvia.

1:14:47.355 --> 1:14:49.156
When I get better,
I will join them.

1:14:51.092 --> 1:14:53.794
We are stronger and
more united than ever.

1:14:54.895 --> 1:14:56.931
We'll beat the
Germans and go home.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.203
I would like to show it to
you. It's very beautiful.

1:15:04.839 --> 1:15:05.839
Arturs.

1:15:07.675 --> 1:15:08.776
Get back here!

1:15:09.777 --> 1:15:10.777
It's not funny.

1:15:14.115 --> 1:15:16.083
You'd better
tell me what you saw.

1:15:17.685 --> 1:15:19.253
They wear red stars.

1:15:19.286 --> 1:15:22.056
But they run as soon
as the Germans come.

1:15:22.089 --> 1:15:24.625
They will have
marched into Latvia.

1:15:24.658 --> 1:15:27.028
They need to build
communism in Moscow.

1:15:27.061 --> 1:15:28.996
Who is going to protect us?

1:15:29.030 --> 1:15:31.065
We should have fought
for own government.

1:15:31.098 --> 1:15:32.566
Stop talking rubbish.

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.036
Every night, people
are killed in Riga.

1:15:35.069 --> 1:15:37.138
Some are killed in the brewery.

1:15:37.171 --> 1:15:38.272
That's the main place.

1:15:39.907 --> 1:15:42.910
Some are killed by the central
prison near the water towers.

1:15:42.943 --> 1:15:45.279
Others are killed
next to the forests.

1:15:45.312 --> 1:15:49.050
They arrest them at noon and
by the evening, they are dead.

1:15:50.217 --> 1:15:51.619
Who is to blame for that?

1:15:51.652 --> 1:15:53.687
For that antichrist
servants' rage?

1:15:54.388 --> 1:15:56.590
Those bastard riflemen.

1:15:56.624 --> 1:15:57.658
Let's get off.

1:15:57.691 --> 1:15:58.893
Me, I'm going further.

1:16:13.707 --> 1:16:14.975
Son of a bitch.

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:21.015
Is he crazy?

1:16:21.048 --> 1:16:23.084
It's good that you came.

1:16:25.052 --> 1:16:27.655
We wouldn't have
managed without you.

1:16:34.061 --> 1:16:36.997
No.

1:16:37.031 --> 1:16:38.031
Yeah?

1:16:39.934 --> 1:16:40.935
I'll go now.

1:16:57.818 --> 1:16:59.178
Comrade commander,
allow me report.

1:16:59.954 --> 1:17:01.455
Transportation has run smoothly.

1:17:01.489 --> 1:17:03.424
The arrested people have
been taken to wagons.

1:17:03.457 --> 1:17:04.457
At ease.

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:06.961
Solder vanags!

1:17:08.329 --> 1:17:09.096
Here.

1:17:09.130 --> 1:17:10.764
How's your leg?

1:17:10.798 --> 1:17:13.634
A bit shorter. But
ready for the revolution.

1:17:26.780 --> 1:17:29.783
Third unit! To the headquarters.

1:17:38.225 --> 1:17:39.225
Go on.

1:17:43.532 --> 1:17:44.532
Halt!

1:17:45.466 --> 1:17:46.466
Turn right!

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:52.706
Get in line!

1:18:13.794 --> 1:18:14.794
Line up!

1:18:16.030 --> 1:18:17.030
Attention!

1:18:21.503 --> 1:18:23.437
Isn't that mikelsons?

1:18:36.016 --> 1:18:40.087
For counter-revolutionary
activities, desertion,

1:18:41.989 --> 1:18:46.994
assisting in desertion and
assisting in an escape attempt,

1:18:48.162 --> 1:18:51.498
for betrayal, the
punishment is death.

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:54.134
Execute the order.

1:19:05.614 --> 1:19:07.248
You can take my underwear, too.

1:19:14.822 --> 1:19:16.558
What are you doing here?

1:19:16.591 --> 1:19:21.362
Guess. You can die in Russia.

1:19:21.395 --> 1:19:22.396
I'll die here.

1:19:25.366 --> 1:19:27.134
Shoot me!

1:19:27.167 --> 1:19:30.004
♪ March on, Latvians ♪

1:19:30.037 --> 1:19:33.007
♪ let's join regiments ♪

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:36.243
♪ let there be
blood, we'll fight ♪

1:19:36.277 --> 1:19:39.213
♪ let the slaves' chains break ♪

1:19:45.352 --> 1:19:46.352
Aim!

1:19:56.363 --> 1:19:57.632
Fire!

1:20:19.486 --> 1:20:21.955
Shoot or you'll be shot.

1:20:24.925 --> 1:20:26.327
Understood?

1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:46.580
Aim!

1:20:56.056 --> 1:21:01.028
Fire!

1:21:04.098 --> 1:21:05.499
Arrest the traitor.

1:21:12.373 --> 1:21:14.308
Mikelsons! Mikelsons!

1:21:15.543 --> 1:21:16.543
Bitches!

1:21:17.411 --> 1:21:19.446
No, I'll kill you.

1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:20.648
Mikelsons, no!

1:21:21.750 --> 1:21:24.151
Konrads, help! Mikelsons, no!

1:21:27.655 --> 1:21:28.655
Mikelsons!

1:21:30.290 --> 1:21:32.627
Whores! I will kill you all!

1:21:33.728 --> 1:21:34.728
Mikelsons!

1:21:53.548 --> 1:21:54.548
Don't stare!

1:22:12.266 --> 1:22:15.969
Hey, lend me that
bucket, friend.

1:22:16.003 --> 1:22:17.505
Why do you need it?

1:22:17.539 --> 1:22:18.539
You'll see.

1:22:25.814 --> 1:22:27.247
Your station. Quickly.

1:22:29.082 --> 1:22:30.117
Quickly. Quickly.

1:22:31.586 --> 1:22:32.586
Not you.

1:22:36.156 --> 1:22:37.156
Good night.

1:22:38.492 --> 1:22:41.763
What are you staring
at? You've got 10 minutes.

1:22:41.796 --> 1:22:42.796
Commander?

1:22:51.706 --> 1:22:53.775
Are you sorry for mikelsons?

1:22:53.808 --> 1:22:55.743
He'd be shot anyway.

1:22:55.777 --> 1:22:58.813
And you'd all be shot,
if I hadn't done it.

1:22:58.847 --> 1:23:00.214
And I'd have been shot.

1:23:02.449 --> 1:23:03.518
You will be shot.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:13.760
Goodbye.

1:23:23.070 --> 1:23:24.271
Let's go to marta.

1:23:26.608 --> 1:23:28.041
She works as a farm hand.

1:23:29.644 --> 1:23:31.144
She'll suggest a hiding place.

1:23:32.079 --> 1:23:35.082
No, when the reds are gone,

1:23:35.115 --> 1:23:37.117
I'll go back, before
the Germans get there.

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.153
Who is expecting you there?

1:23:41.388 --> 1:23:44.124
Latvians are finally forming
national forces in cesis.

1:23:46.093 --> 1:23:48.395
While I'm not at home,
the war is not over.

1:23:53.902 --> 1:23:54.902
Devils!

1:23:59.774 --> 1:24:01.074
To the forest!

1:24:01.108 --> 1:24:03.443
Stop, we will shoot!

1:24:09.182 --> 1:24:10.182
Betrayer!

1:24:12.486 --> 1:24:13.855
Son of a bitch.

1:24:15.155 --> 1:24:16.290
Where are they?

1:24:18.893 --> 1:24:21.228
Konrads! Konrads, let's go.

1:24:21.261 --> 1:24:22.462
Get him.

1:24:22.496 --> 1:24:23.765
Konrads!

1:24:23.798 --> 1:24:25.867
Get him.

1:24:25.900 --> 1:24:27.635
I'll shoot!

1:24:33.407 --> 1:24:35.108
Don't make me get off my horse!

1:24:38.145 --> 1:24:39.179
Check the other side.

1:25:29.864 --> 1:25:31.298
Have you seen a solder here?

1:25:31.331 --> 1:25:31.966
No.

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:32.967
Don't lie!

1:25:33.001 --> 1:25:33.801
No.

1:25:33.835 --> 1:25:35.335
Let's go.

1:25:35.369 --> 1:25:37.304
If you see anyone, report it.

1:25:37.337 --> 1:25:38.438
Of course, comrades.

1:25:44.979 --> 1:25:47.147
Why do you hide from
your own people?

1:25:49.316 --> 1:25:50.852
They are not mine anymore.

1:29:12.887 --> 1:29:13.988
I have to go.

1:29:18.425 --> 1:29:19.927
Please promise to take me home.

1:29:31.471 --> 1:29:32.540
Wrong finger.

1:29:49.523 --> 1:29:52.827
We must defend cesis.
And liberate Riga!

1:29:53.828 --> 1:29:54.996
We fought under the reds',

1:29:55.029 --> 1:29:56.964
the tsar's and even
the German flag.

1:30:01.936 --> 1:30:05.039
And we have always been cheated.

1:30:05.072 --> 1:30:09.010
It's time to fight under our
own red, white and red flag.

1:30:11.245 --> 1:30:12.914
We won't be servants any more.

1:30:13.915 --> 1:30:17.484
Time to defend our land,
our home, our family.

1:30:20.154 --> 1:30:23.456
The guns will be useful.

1:30:23.490 --> 1:30:24.490
Whose gun was it?

1:30:25.726 --> 1:30:27.494
The fallen rifleman konrads'.

1:30:28.296 --> 1:30:29.296
May I?

1:30:48.049 --> 1:30:49.517
Gatis!

1:30:51.018 --> 1:30:52.018
Next.

1:30:56.958 --> 1:30:58.491
Great army you have there.

1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:01.963
Kids, deserters and refugees.

1:31:05.266 --> 1:31:09.003
Listen. An Estonian armored
train is on its way.

1:31:09.036 --> 1:31:11.739
Defend the railway bridge
until their forces arrive.

1:31:16.177 --> 1:31:18.879
Listen to my command!

1:31:20.982 --> 1:31:22.516
Down!

1:31:31.092 --> 1:31:33.194
Milksops! On your feet!

1:31:34.895 --> 1:31:37.031
On your feet, everybody!

1:31:37.064 --> 1:31:38.064
Go!

1:31:40.735 --> 1:31:43.004
Don't sit there! Get up!

1:31:43.037 --> 1:31:44.205
Come on! Get up!

1:32:57.912 --> 1:32:58.979
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:01.782 --> 1:33:03.717
Down. Reload.

1:33:04.952 --> 1:33:06.387
Clear?

1:33:06.420 --> 1:33:07.888
Once again.

1:33:07.922 --> 1:33:09.723
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:11.092 --> 1:33:13.294
Down! Reload!

1:33:19.100 --> 1:33:20.768
Once again.

1:33:20.801 --> 1:33:21.801
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:23.437 --> 1:33:24.705
Down! Reload!

1:33:27.808 --> 1:33:28.808
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:30.811 --> 1:33:31.811
Reload!

1:33:32.413 --> 1:33:33.413
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:34.682 --> 1:33:35.682
Reload!

1:33:36.917 --> 1:33:38.319
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:38.352 --> 1:33:39.352
Reload!

1:33:41.722 --> 1:33:42.722
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:44.091 --> 1:33:45.092
Reload!

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.060
Aim! Shoot!

1:33:49.864 --> 1:33:50.864
Reload!

1:33:54.368 --> 1:33:55.368
Aim! Shoot!

1:35:33.167 --> 1:35:36.103
To our brothers and fathers,

1:35:37.171 --> 1:35:40.841
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:35:40.874 --> 1:35:43.410
To our brothers and fathers,

1:35:43.444 --> 1:35:45.379
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:35:47.616 --> 1:35:50.084
To our brothers and fathers,

1:35:50.117 --> 1:35:52.419
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:35:52.453 --> 1:35:54.556
To our brothers and fathers,

1:35:54.589 --> 1:35:57.291
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:35:57.324 --> 1:35:59.561
To our brothers and fathers,

1:35:59.594 --> 1:36:01.962
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:36:01.996 --> 1:36:04.532
To our brothers and fathers,

1:36:04.566 --> 1:36:07.968
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:36:11.438 --> 1:36:14.074
To our brothers and fathers,

1:36:14.108 --> 1:36:17.177
who have died defending
our fatherland.

1:36:22.016 --> 1:36:23.984
To our brothers and fathers,

1:36:24.018 --> 1:36:27.254
who have died defending
our fatherland.
