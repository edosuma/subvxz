Hey, Myrna,

02:19.280 --> 02:21.840
we're all in agreement with the
"drugs are bad" thing,

02:21.840 --> 02:23.440
but can you turn their lives around

02:23.440 --> 02:26.360
after we've paid back The Dean
and avoided certain death?

02:30.640 --> 02:35.160
Right, I want you to give one of
these to everyone who buys from you.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.280
And don't just dump them in the bin.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.080
I will know.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.520
We need more staff. Staff?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.520
Bigger demand means bigger workload.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.760
We need to recruit more runners.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.280
Are you serious?

03:29.280 --> 03:31.320
Look, I can't be ruining no more
kids' lives.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.560
How else are we going to deal with
the demand?

03:40.480 --> 03:41.800
We really need to do this?

03:44.560 --> 03:46.080
I'm sorry. I don't know.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.440
I just...

03:48.720 --> 03:50.240
It's just four weeks.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.480
Four more weeks.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.200
How are you finding things in here?

04:06.200 --> 04:10.880
My masseuse ain't great but
Margarita Wednesday's a sweet touch.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.160
Who's running your line, while
you're inside?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.840
You got any pull with the governor?

04:16.840 --> 04:19.800
Have you been doing business with
someone called The Dean?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.560
Plumbing in here is proper
old-school,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.720
so when anyone on the floors above
yanks their flush,

04:29.720 --> 04:32.480
their shit bubbles up into the
toilet in my cell.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.640
It's like brown lava.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.040
Nasty ain't the word.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.720
I could have a word about a transfer...

04:45.240 --> 04:47.520
..if you tell me about The Dean.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.040
It's aight.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.520
I'll get used to having a shit
volcano in the corner of my bedroom.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.080
I'll call it...

04:55.080 --> 04:56.920
..CRAPatoa.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.440
How about them?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.280
No, no, no, I'll speak to them.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.480
Kids get intimidated by adults,
so a woman's less threatening.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.120
Hello. Um, I was wondering if I
could ask you a quick question?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.320
Um...

05:40.320 --> 05:43.560
Where do you see yourself in the
next five years?

05:43.560 --> 05:45.080
In your vagina.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.280
You're a disgusting young man.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.200
You want me to show you how
disgusting?

05:52.200 --> 05:55.520
All right, all right, all right, all
right, all right.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.600
Let me.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.400
Do you lot want to make some money?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.480
Do we have to hold your thing?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.920
Brook Hill are recruiting, right now.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.280
Anyone that you bring to us that we
take on, earn yourself a fiver.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.280
You've got one hour or the deal's
off.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.560
What are you waiting for?

06:32.080 --> 06:33.800
Mr Halloran,

06:33.800 --> 06:37.680
I don't see anything on your CV
about computer experience.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.640
Why is that?

06:39.640 --> 06:41.560
Well, I mean....

06:41.560 --> 06:44.960
..can a computer sell fully floating
two-piece brake rotors

06:44.960 --> 06:46.720
to the Swedish World Rally team?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.920
We're developing AI algorithms that
can, yes.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.280
Which is why I've recently purchased
a Toshiba laptop...

07:00.280 --> 07:03.000
..voted Which? magazine's best
mid-price all-rounder,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.120
two years in a row.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.800
You all know what working for
Brook Hill entails, right?

07:16.760 --> 07:18.720
Are you Jamie Honeywell's nephew?

07:21.720 --> 07:23.160
Later, then.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.400
Hey.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.720
What's up?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.440
What's wrong with him?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
His uncle's a fed.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.000
But we need bodies. No, we can't
just take anyone.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.040
But...

07:41.200 --> 07:45.440
Can you give me an example of a
conflict you've experienced at work

07:45.440 --> 07:48.560
and how you resolved it amicably?

07:52.720 --> 07:54.200
Yeah. Actually, yes.

07:54.200 --> 07:58.000
A lady at work was asking for
endless days off.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.560
She said she had long Covid

07:59.560 --> 08:02.240
and I gave her the benefit of the
doubt, as you do,

08:02.240 --> 08:05.840
then saw her abseiling at
Chessington World of Adventures.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.880
And how did you resolve this
conflict amicably?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.280
Fired her.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.240
It was fine, though. She had
a zero-hours contract, so...

08:18.600 --> 08:21.120
How old are you? I'm eight.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.640
Ten.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.280
Get to school!

08:24.280 --> 08:26.080
I mean it. Go!

08:26.080 --> 08:28.160
Bye.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.920
I don't think you're quite right
for us

08:30.920 --> 08:34.480
but feel free to grab a Nespresso on
the way out.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.800
Nah.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.160
Come on, B. No, not you, Tyler.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.600
I done this before, I know the drill.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.000
I'm a hard worker, punctual,
and I got my own bike.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.520
No.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.720
Why? Because I don't trust you. OK.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.160
Can I speak to you, please?

09:00.360 --> 09:01.840
Why can't we use him?

09:01.840 --> 09:03.920
We're going to run out of people
at this rate.

09:03.920 --> 09:07.240
Tyler is 18. If he gets nabbed,
he's going to do time.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.000
Plus, he's not the brightest light
on the Christmas tree.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.880
OK, well, we're not auditioning
for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.640
We need drug runners, people who can
count in tens and run fast.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.240
Trust me, we don't want him.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.800
OK, but we need him!

09:27.000 --> 09:28.600
Tyler, you're in.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.840
All right, step up.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.400
Come take your phone.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.000
What are you doing? Have you never
painted a door before?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.760
No. Half the time, I don't open them
for myself.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.280
Well, that's not how you do it.
Give it here.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.680
Right, look.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.920
You get about a centimetre of paint
on the end of the brush, all right?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.800
And we're going to go up.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.800
Pull up, pull up, pull up.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.520
Understand? Not really. Could you
show me again?

10:19.520 --> 10:21.960
Right, look and learn.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.240
We're pulling up, we're pulling up,
we're pulling up.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.880
Nice and neat, yeah?

10:32.600 --> 10:33.720
Hello?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.920
Hi, yes. Can I place a coffee order,
please, for delivery?

10:36.920 --> 10:38.120
What do you want?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.280
The cleanest way to wash
and transfer this money

10:40.280 --> 10:42.800
to The Dean's Swiss account is to
set up a shell company.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.280
Well, we need an offshore tax haven
for that, don't we?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
Gibraltar or Virgin Islands
or something.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.880
You'd think so, but those places
have tightened up the rules.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.520
We need somewhere that doesn't
bother with their due diligence.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.400
Like Azerbaijan?

10:54.400 --> 10:55.760
Britain. Britain?

10:55.760 --> 10:57.960
We're one of the best places
in the world for fraud.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.440
This country really doesn't bother
with all that expensive,

11:00.440 --> 11:02.160
time-consuming due diligence stuff.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.080
So, I went on the Companies House website,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.160
and for £12, I set up a company.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.960
And since 11am, we've been trading
as Laycock Logistical Services.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.720
You're welcome.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.240
Right.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.600
But it's not all good news.

11:18.520 --> 11:22.760
I was thinking, why don't I take you
to the beach tomorrow?

11:22.760 --> 11:24.400
We don't have time for a mini-break.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.440
It's just for the day, just to get
away, get a bit of perspective.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.880
It's nothing big. But I have so much
to do,

11:29.880 --> 11:32.040
and what if we're needed suddenly?
Then...

11:32.040 --> 11:33.560
Rani, you can take the afternoon off

11:33.560 --> 11:35.560
to spend some time with your boyfriend.

11:36.760 --> 11:37.800
Boyfriend?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.880
Aren't I?

11:40.880 --> 11:42.880
We just haven't used those words before.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.080
Yeah, I know, but...

11:45.080 --> 11:47.000
..we care about each other.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.600
We share a flat, beds.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.800
Are you not my girlfriend?

11:55.400 --> 11:56.640
Yeah?

11:59.240 --> 12:03.240
Oi, Bonnie and Clyde, problem.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.520
When we come to the lock, that is
a different kettle of fish.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.840
OK, I'm going to keep it low, keep
it loose, keep those hips loose...

12:10.840 --> 12:14.720
..and really simple,
clean line down, creep off.

12:14.720 --> 12:21.120
Creep and pull off. Yep, creep and
pull off.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.440
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.120
Have you got a permit?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.280
What is going on here?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.280
You're bringing in too much money.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.720
You're like the West Country Pablo
Escobar and her boyfriend.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.040
We can't put it all through Casino's
and Gabby's client account

12:37.040 --> 12:38.600
without drawing attention.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.920
We need to diversify, find a third
way to launder all this cash.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.560
OK. So, what's your plan?

12:43.560 --> 12:46.760
I don't know. I ran out of ideas
after Laycock Logistical Services.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.440
Get out of here!

12:49.440 --> 12:51.760
I'm going to put out a tweet that
will shred you.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.080
What is the matter with her?

12:53.080 --> 12:55.120
You come back tomorrow and...

12:55.120 --> 12:56.280
All right, stop!

12:59.200 --> 13:00.880
Can you believe this?

13:00.880 --> 13:03.200
After all our hard work.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.440
What?

13:04.440 --> 13:06.520
The council is selling this place

13:06.520 --> 13:09.680
to some telecommunication corporate arsewipes,

13:09.680 --> 13:12.560
so they can demolish it and build
a mobile phone mast.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.240
I mean, guys, I love my mobile phone

13:17.240 --> 13:19.560
but we have spent ages renovating
this place.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.880
I've told them we're going to do
a demo here tomorrow.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.880
We are going to bring down the media
and we are going to raise a stink.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.200
Who is with me? Greg?
Yes, obviously.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.760
Is he?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.800
We all have a lot on our plates
at the moment.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.800
We need to save this place
from developers.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.320
We're not the Goonies.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.440
What?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.360
Myrna, I mean, you're on my side,
right?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.040
We'll get your group on board.

13:39.040 --> 13:44.000
Yeah, I mean, I can bring it up
at a meeting, but as Rani says,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.280
I've got a lot on my plate at the moment.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.960
What's wrong with you?!

13:50.400 --> 13:51.800
Ben?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.680
We are going to the beach tomorrow.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.960
The beach?

13:57.120 --> 13:58.800
Diane?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.840
Well, in order to organise
a demonstration,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.960
you need to give the police written
notice at least 24 hours before.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.680
You've only got 19 hours left.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.840
So, if you did do that, I would have
to take you down.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.320
Why does nobody care about this?

14:12.640 --> 14:16.440
We could raise the funds and buy
the place ourselves.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.600
I am so disappointed in all of you.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.760
I thought we were a team.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.680
Yeah?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.200
Is that the Panty Patrol?

15:03.200 --> 15:04.280
Speaking.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.400
Coffee delivery.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.480
Yo, hang loose, my G. Let me get
your money.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.960
Come in, shut the door, man.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.200
150, there you go, mate.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.280
Sweet watch, bruv. What is it,
a Rollie?

15:28.280 --> 15:30.400
Thanks, bruv. It's actually
a Patek Philippe.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.200
It's actually worth a bit more
than a Rolex.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.560
Where do you buy a watch like that?

15:33.560 --> 15:35.640
I didn't buy it. It used to belong
to my grandfather.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.840
But you know what they say,
you don't own one of these,

15:37.840 --> 15:40.080
you just look after them for the
next owner.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.800
Hah.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.880
Yeah, which is me, innit?

15:43.880 --> 15:45.200
I'm sorry, what?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.560
I'm the next owner.

15:46.560 --> 15:50.920
So, give me my watch and I own that laptop

15:50.920 --> 15:54.560
and how much cash have you got in
here? Cos I own all of that, too.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.040
OK, that's... Yeah, honestly, take
whatever you need, mate.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.480
Take whatever you need.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.320
We could use social media presence
to raise awareness,

16:01.320 --> 16:03.640
which I would be happy to do.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.160
What is going on?

16:05.160 --> 16:07.520
I'm just bringing everyone up to
speed with our campaign.

16:07.520 --> 16:10.880
What campaign? To save the community
centre, as we discussed.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.280
We didn't discuss anything.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.280
I said I would bring it up with
the group.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.440
And that's what I'm doing.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.600
Greg.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.880
Well, the 2012 Localism Act means
that a group like yours

16:19.880 --> 16:21.640
can "stop the clock" on the sale

16:21.640 --> 16:24.040
and nominate it as an "asset of
community value",

16:24.040 --> 16:26.000
which allows you time to prepare
a bid,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.760
so you can actually buy it yourselves

16:27.760 --> 16:29.760
for the "wider benefit of the
community".

16:29.760 --> 16:31.400
One - can you "stop doing that"?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.960
And two - what would we do with a
building like that?

16:33.960 --> 16:35.520
Open a community hub.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.560
Rehab centre, pre-natal advice,
groups for local kids.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.960
It's a great idea.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.080
Yeah, well, obviously, but how do we
buy a building?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.360
Fundraising.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.680
It was Greg's idea.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.880
Oh, was it, now?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.040
We are planning a demo for tomorrow.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.640
Right, well, you can't do that.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.080
Because you need to give the police
24 hours written notice

16:54.080 --> 16:55.720
before you can have a demonstration.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.240
Since when do you care about
the police?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.840
Has anyone thought about the optics?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.000
Optics?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.000
An over-privileged white woman,
no offence,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.400
fronting a black civil rights organisation.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.880
She wouldn't be fronting it.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.920
She'd be an enthusiastic celebrity supporter

17:12.920 --> 17:15.120
with a million followers on social media.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.960
It is 1.2 million.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.880
Right, so, that's what we've become
now, have we?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.960
Getting into bed with fame whores.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.320
No offence.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.560
These days, any campaign has to cut
through the noise

17:25.560 --> 17:28.000
to the wider public. Her Ladyship
could help us with that.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.480
Just think of the fundraising
potential. No.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.360
I am the Director of the BJC

17:33.360 --> 17:37.280
and, no, I am too uneasy about this.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.600
Then we have to put it to the vote.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.400
All those in favour?

17:41.400 --> 17:42.680
Yeah.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.000
Greg, can I have a word?

17:51.160 --> 17:53.280
What are you doing?!

17:53.280 --> 17:57.400
Gabby is the only thing that links
me to that stolen money

17:57.400 --> 17:58.880
and you're bringing her down here

17:58.880 --> 18:01.400
with some crazy idea about buying
the community centre.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.680
Yeah, because this is how we launder
the rest of the drug money. What?

18:04.680 --> 18:07.520
Brownie? Oh, brownie, yeah, thanks
very much. Lovely.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.600
No, thanks, Beth.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.280
You're right. A moment on the lips,
a lifetime...

18:12.280 --> 18:13.640
Off your tits.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.960
That's Acid Beth.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.520
Eat one of her brownies, you ain't
coming down for days.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.120
Now, what were you saying about
laundering money?

18:21.120 --> 18:24.800
Right, look, BJC fundraise to save
the community centre, all right?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.120
Real people make cash donations,
all right?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.480
A fiver here, a quid there.

18:29.480 --> 18:32.160
To those real donations, we add the
drug money,

18:32.160 --> 18:34.040
mix 'em all together, give 'em a
good wash,

18:34.040 --> 18:35.440
pay that into the BJC account,

18:35.440 --> 18:38.440
and then, transfer out what we need
to Laycock Logistical Services.

18:38.440 --> 18:42.600
No! I am not using the BJC to wash
dirty money.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.520
We need an organisation that
regularly deposits big sums of cash

18:45.520 --> 18:47.960
into the bank without causing suspicion.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.880
Claire is already suspicious of
everything I do.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.400
How do I explain this?

18:52.400 --> 18:55.240
You don't have to explain it. You
just make me the BJC treasurer.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.960
Say that Gabby demands that

18:56.960 --> 18:59.480
her lawyer has independent financial oversight.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.760
Yeah, right, cos that sounds like her.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.720
Grant me access to the BJC account,
I'll take care of the whole thing.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.000
Plus, Gabby was right.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Do we really want to see that
building torn down

19:08.000 --> 19:09.360
after all the work we've done?

19:09.360 --> 19:12.480
No, that could be a community hub,
owned and operated by the BJC,

19:12.480 --> 19:13.880
helping the people of Bristol.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.920
That could be a real thing.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.320
That could be our legacy.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.040
My legacy. No, our legacy.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.720
So, this may be nothing but a bloke
just came in,

19:31.720 --> 19:33.520
says he was robbed at knife-point

19:33.520 --> 19:37.920
and the thief just walks in the
front door, no mask, nothing.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.840
All sounds a bit suspect.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.320
What do you think?

19:41.320 --> 19:42.520
Drug buy gone wrong?

19:42.520 --> 19:44.160
Mm. That's what I'm wondering.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.800
Let's go.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.720
Got a favourite criminal, or...?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.800
No? No, sir.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.280
I'm a Shipman guy.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.800
Hello, sir. I'm Detective Sergeant Haines.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.520
This is Detective Sergeant Selforth.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.000
We understand you've been robbed.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, yeah. Utter ball-ache but, you
know, these things happen.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.200
I just need someone to rubber-stamp
a report for my insurance claim.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.760
How did the thief gain entry into
your home, sir?

20:10.760 --> 20:14.320
He...he rang the door bell and...and
I opened the door.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.480
So, you know the thief.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.600
No.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.840
Then, why'd you let him in?

20:19.840 --> 20:22.840
The poor lad said he was out and about

20:22.840 --> 20:26.480
and got caught short and he needed
to use the toilet.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.480
Couldn't he just pee in an alley or
something?

20:29.480 --> 20:31.440
Yeah, he could've, um...

20:31.440 --> 20:34.280
..but he said he needed more than
a pee.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.120
So, you let a teenage boy into your
house to take a shit?

20:38.840 --> 20:40.320
I did. That's very kind of you.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.080
Yeah, which is why this all just
hurts so much

20:44.080 --> 20:45.960
cos I...I feel used.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.680
So, I assume this thief,

20:47.680 --> 20:51.560
if he was just in your house to take
a dump, didn't have a mask on?

20:51.560 --> 20:54.680
No. So, you got a good look at him.
Could you give us a description?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.720
OK. Um, look...

20:56.720 --> 20:58.640
..I'm actually a lawyer myself,

20:58.640 --> 21:01.560
so I'm aware you guys are woefully
under-resourced.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.720
I'm not proposing a manhunt for the guy.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.840
I just need someone to sign and
stamp this

21:05.840 --> 21:07.800
and I'll be out of your hair.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.880
Which is looking incredibly glossy,
if I may say.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.800
What conditioner do you use?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.680
What drugs were you buying?

21:13.680 --> 21:14.880
Er...

21:16.200 --> 21:18.360
I wasn't... I wasn't buying drugs.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.440
Like I said, I just thought the chap
needed an innocent poo.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.600
He got a laptop, hard drive, iPad,
Patek Philippe wristwatch.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
Don't they say you never really own
one of those...?

21:27.600 --> 21:29.840
You're just looking after them for
the next owner, yes.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.880
Do you want to just sign it and I
can be on my way? No.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.720
We can't let this sort of thing happen

21:33.720 --> 21:36.000
to esteemed members of our legal profession.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.040
Come with us. Um, why?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.360
Come on. It'll be quick.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.120
I do have plans today.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.040
I'm going to a bitcoin seminar
in Swindon.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.520
Sort of like curly fringe, wavy,
sort of.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.200
Yeah, yeah.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.400
Great. We'll run this through
the system.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.560
If he has a record, we'll find the swine.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.920
You've got to focus on the bigger picture.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.200
I'm only in it for a few weeks, and
then, it'll be over,

22:03.200 --> 22:05.600
and the good that the BJC will do in
the future

22:05.600 --> 22:07.960
will make up for the bad that I'm
doing now.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.840
Any real change implies the breaking
of the world

22:14.840 --> 22:17.160
as we have always known it.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.240

here. Yeah.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.760
And some local news.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.720
You mentioned about doing a
livestream?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.360
Yeah, good point. I'll get on it.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.120
What are you doing here?

22:53.120 --> 22:55.880
I'm here in my official capacity as
a trainee PCSO.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.120
These things start with a few
banners and a sing-song,

22:58.120 --> 23:01.000
but then end with you getting shot
in the gonads by a rubber bullet.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.280
Now, I don't want to have to do
that, but if it comes to it, I will.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.240
All right? You've been warned.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.000
This is us.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.320
The little people versus big
business and it is war,

23:14.320 --> 23:16.720
which is why I am dressed to fight.

23:16.720 --> 23:20.040
So, just in case you were wondering,
the cardigan is vintage Valentino

23:20.040 --> 23:22.800
and the shorts are upcycled
by Miu Miu.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.720
So, come on down and join the fight.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.640
Brownie?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.120
No, thanks, I'm in training.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.600
Platform 10, the delayed
10:45 CrossCountry Service...

23:50.600 --> 23:53.240
OK, look, revenue's really good,
it's just not high enough.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.120
It's like...it's like there's a hole somewhere.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.880
I think we need to re-check figures
on the three-for-twos.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.800
Hey.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.680
Can you put that away...

24:02.680 --> 24:04.560
..for just a few hours?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.640
Yeah, yeah.

24:10.920 --> 24:15.480
The 11:30 Weston-super-Mare
train is now arriving on platform 4.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.200
Oi, check it out.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.480
Cool, I love it.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.040
Drake rocks one just like it.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.080
You always see it when he's on
stage cos it catches the light.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.240
Touch it.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.120
Oh, shit.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.760
♪ And every day's the same since
I met you... ♪

24:47.400 --> 24:51.240
♪ It's such a pretty world today

24:51.240 --> 24:56.960
♪ Knowing that you're mine Ooh

24:56.960 --> 25:02.000
♪ And happiness is being close to
you... ♪

25:02.000 --> 25:05.240
You know, when I was seven, my mum
brought me here for the day.

25:07.040 --> 25:11.640
First time I ever saw sand, donkeys,
all of that.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.440
Was it weird?

25:17.440 --> 25:19.120
Nah.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.480
Nah, it was cool.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.800
It's one of the very few happy
memories I've got with her.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.760
Got with anyone.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.480
Oh, my days.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.040
I remember this place.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.480
I had my first fish and chips here,
that day.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.040
The batter...

25:39.040 --> 25:40.840
..incredible.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.720
It's amazing it's still here.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.440
Just about.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.880
You ever remember something so much,
it's like you made it up?

25:51.160 --> 25:53.720
Like you drew it in your imagination
or something.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.360
That's how I feel, when I think
about this place.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.560
I want you to imagine something,
yeah? Mm-hm.

26:03.560 --> 26:08.240
Imagine a sign that says, "Ben And
Rani's Caribbean Cookout".

26:11.240 --> 26:13.000
Nah, I'm serious.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.880
We should buy this place.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.840
My cooking, your brains.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.600
What, did you bring me here...

26:20.600 --> 26:22.440
..for this?

26:22.440 --> 26:25.520
Yeah, I saw it online for sale.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.040
OK, so...

26:28.440 --> 26:32.280
..we'd move to Weston and run a
food shack together?

26:32.280 --> 26:35.480
Yeah. I mean, you ever wanted to
live by the sea?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.920
I mean, it's...it's out there...

26:40.920 --> 26:41.960
..somewhere.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.640
Do you want to have a look inside?

26:50.240 --> 26:51.520
Yeah. OK, fine.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.920
Yeah? All right, I'll call the
estate agent.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.920
It's open.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.840
Can you positively identify the
thief?

27:05.840 --> 27:07.760
Number three. You sure?

27:07.760 --> 27:11.960
Yes, but he's not wearing my watch,
which is concerning.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.280
Wow.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.200
I never knew you could do this. You
can hear your eyes breathing.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.640
Listen. Shhh!

27:23.640 --> 27:25.840
I can't hear anything. You can't
hear that?

27:27.120 --> 27:29.240
Are you all right? Yeah, you?

27:31.280 --> 27:33.440
Oh, it's bouncy.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.640
Oh.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.760
I'm here with Kelly.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.840
Now, when this place was a community
centre back in the '90s,

27:40.840 --> 27:43.640
it helped you turn your life around,
didn't it, Kelly?

27:43.640 --> 27:46.840
When my mum died, I started using
drugs and alcohol,

27:46.840 --> 27:49.160
got evicted, I was living on the streets,

27:49.160 --> 27:52.080
and one day, I just came in here
to get out of the cold.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.480
The people were so caring,

27:53.480 --> 27:55.960
didn't judge, they just listened to
me when I said...

27:55.960 --> 27:58.560
Listening is so important.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.400
Yeah, it helped me get my confidence
back, my self-esteem.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.760
They helped me get a flat.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.600
They helped me go back to school and
I turned my life around.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.120
Amazingly, Kelly is now a doctor.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.320
I'm a chiropractor.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.120
Amazing.

28:13.120 --> 28:16.080
Thank you for sharing your amazing
story with us, Kelly.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.040
God bless you, sweetie.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.120
Can I have a hug? OK.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.960
At me, if this hit you as hard as
it's hit me.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.960
We need to help people like Kelly,
so come on, come down here.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.080
Oh, sh, sh. It's OK.

28:30.080 --> 28:33.600
It's all right. We'll find her,
don't worry. Don't cry.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.240
Oh, it's OK.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.320
Right, you stay there. We'll find
her, OK?

28:37.320 --> 28:39.120
All right.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.280
Has anyone lost a small child?

28:42.280 --> 28:43.560
She's got no hair.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.160
So, why did you leave your previous
employment?

29:00.160 --> 29:02.520
I felt like I'd hit a bit of a glass ceiling.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.200
You felt like you hit a glass ceiling

29:06.200 --> 29:10.040
at a company called Halloran & Son,
where you were the son in question?

29:10.040 --> 29:13.560
Yes, love. Yeah, I...I do. I did.

29:13.560 --> 29:17.960
Hitting the glass ceiling normally
refers to women or minority groups

29:17.960 --> 29:21.680
encountering invisible barriers to
their career because of prejudice.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.320
Yep. And you feel that applies to
you?

29:24.320 --> 29:27.800
Prejudice can impact anyone, I think,

29:27.800 --> 29:31.040
and what I want to do is...

29:31.040 --> 29:33.360
I want to... I want to smash that
ceiling, you know?

29:33.360 --> 29:34.760
And I want to reach back in

29:34.760 --> 29:37.760
and I want to pull up anyone who's
behind me, you know?

29:37.760 --> 29:40.400
Be they women or...

29:40.400 --> 29:43.680
..immigrants, minorities, anyone,
you know,

29:43.680 --> 29:47.480
as long as they're hard workers and
they pass the background checks.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.560
Thank you for taking the time to
come in today.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.520
That's it? We're done?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.200
Did I get the job?

30:07.200 --> 30:10.680
I'm afraid not. We've decided to go
a different way.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.040
What does that mean?

30:16.240 --> 30:18.160
We're looking for someone

30:18.160 --> 30:21.960
who can integrate into a more
contemporary ecosystem.

30:23.200 --> 30:28.480
I can integrate into an ecosystem.
I can. That's...

30:28.480 --> 30:30.720
Please, look, I...

30:30.720 --> 30:31.960
..I need this job.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.920
OK? And, so, you know...

30:38.920 --> 30:41.480
Come on. Just give me a chance.

30:43.640 --> 30:44.800
I'm sorry.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.320
Sorry for calling you love,
just then.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.880
I don't know what that was. Sorry.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.880
I just... I don't even say that
normally. Just a slip of the tongue.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.160
It's fine.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.840
Well, is it, though?

31:10.840 --> 31:12.800
I mean, you're not hiring me, are
you?

31:12.800 --> 31:14.600
Not because of that.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.920
I just... I don't know.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.560
I don't know what I'm supposed to
say or do any more.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.960
Changing by the bloody minute, isn't
it?

31:22.960 --> 31:26.280
It just...it just seems like from
the beginning of time, you know,

31:26.280 --> 31:29.720
if it...if it wagged its tail and
it barked and looked like a dog,

31:29.720 --> 31:31.640
it was a dog.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.360
And these days, it turns out it
could be a cat.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.880
It could be a cat.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.960
But if you call it a dog and it's
actually a cat,

31:37.960 --> 31:39.680
that's it, man, you're just...

31:39.680 --> 31:42.160
You're cancelled. No second chances.

31:42.160 --> 31:46.160
You know, I'm a... I'm a middle-aged
white bloke. Sorry, you know?

31:46.160 --> 31:49.360
I can't help it. I was born this
way and...

31:49.360 --> 31:52.920
..that's it. It doesn't
automatically make me homophobic

31:52.920 --> 31:57.720
or transphobic or sexist
or racist, OK?

31:57.720 --> 32:01.200
Yes, I did... I did recently fire one
of our black delivery guys,

32:01.200 --> 32:02.760
not because he was black,

32:02.760 --> 32:06.200
because he was reading his Kindle
while he was driving.

32:06.200 --> 32:09.160
And, ladies, for what it's worth,

32:09.160 --> 32:11.880
if my hand happens to brush up
against you in the lift,

32:11.880 --> 32:14.960
it doesn't automatically make me
Harvey bloody Weinstein, OK?

32:14.960 --> 32:18.040
Cos believe it or not, not every
single living man out there

32:18.040 --> 32:21.000
wants to jump your bones at every
fucking opportunity.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.640
Thanks for coming in.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.120
This place would need so much work.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.080
Doesn't anything that's worth doing?

32:48.760 --> 32:51.040
You ready for my menu ideas, yeah?

32:51.040 --> 32:54.960
Aight, so we got ackee and saltfish, dumpling,

32:54.960 --> 32:59.000
oxtail, jerk chicken rice and peas,

32:59.000 --> 33:02.080
green mango chutney, sorrel -

33:02.080 --> 33:03.960
all the stuff my grandma used to make.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.120
So, what do you say?

33:13.760 --> 33:14.880
Hello?

33:14.880 --> 33:16.000
You're screwed.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.560
Did you scoop new recruits without
talking to me?

33:19.560 --> 33:22.080
Well, business is booming. We needed
extra hands.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.960
Well, one of your new hands pulled
a knife on a customer,

33:24.960 --> 33:27.400
who then went to the feds, who've
now picked him up.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.120
Some youth called Tyler?

33:29.120 --> 33:31.200
Are you even vetting these people?

33:31.200 --> 33:33.360
Well, how are you meant to vet
drug dealers,

33:33.360 --> 33:35.640
you know, ask for a CV and a
reference?

33:35.640 --> 33:38.480
I beg you tell me this Tyler ain't
seen your face.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.640
He...

33:39.640 --> 33:41.120
Yeah, he has seen my face.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.040
Shit! What?

33:43.040 --> 33:45.840
That means he can ID you,
you amateur.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.480
He could be looking at
a ten stretch.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.040
Which means? Which means he'll trade
you for a reduced sentence.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.160
And once they've got you, genius,
they've got me.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.760
There has to be something we can do.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.920
Damn right. Stop him talking ASAP.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.400
OK, how do we do that...?

34:04.920 --> 34:06.200
You all right, officer?

34:13.200 --> 34:14.720
Go on, then.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.560
Are you going to say,
"I told you so"?

34:17.640 --> 34:18.880
I was going to say...

34:22.600 --> 34:23.840
..we need a good lawyer.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.480
No, we need a bad lawyer.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.800
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.680
Breathe, calm down, we can sort this.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.680
How? He'll have a duty lawyer
assigned to him

34:36.680 --> 34:38.560
and he'll encourage him to make
any deal he can,

34:38.560 --> 34:40.040
and then he'll start naming names,

34:40.040 --> 34:41.960
and one of the names he's going to
name is your name

34:41.960 --> 34:43.240
and that'll lead to my name.

34:43.240 --> 34:45.760
OK, so, just get in that police cell
and stop him talking.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
How the bloody hell am I supposed
to do that?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.880
Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.440
Just breathe, calm down. We can
figure it out. It's fine.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.480
There's no way to get inside a
police cell.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.160
There is always a way. Think.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.680
We're on our way back now.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.880
Did you commit armed robbery in
broad daylight with no mask,

35:10.880 --> 35:12.560
nothing covering your face?

35:14.320 --> 35:15.920
Peppa Pig.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.880
Either you're incredibly stupid

35:17.880 --> 35:21.200
or you didn't go to that flat with
the intention of robbing anyone.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.680
Why did you go to the flat?

35:22.680 --> 35:23.960
Peppa Pig.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.760
Are you involved in drug dealing?

35:26.760 --> 35:28.760
Peppa... Pig. I got it.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.360

35:45.040 --> 35:48.000
I told you I was right to involve a celebrity.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.480
Lady Gabby.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.560
Hi, guys. Esther Mansfield, West
Country News.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.000
How do you react to the controversy
around your livestream?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.240
What controversy?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.680
Have you read some of the things

36:00.680 --> 36:02.440
that people are saying about you
online?

36:02.440 --> 36:03.960
What are people saying?

36:03.960 --> 36:05.960
"Tell Lady Gabby I'd like to donate
money..."

36:05.960 --> 36:07.400
Yay, great!

36:07.400 --> 36:10.160
"..so this dumb airhead can go back
to school

36:10.160 --> 36:13.240
"and learn about white saviour
complex."

36:13.240 --> 36:15.040
That took a turn I wasn't expecting.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.480
Mm. You're trending.

36:16.480 --> 36:20.680
People are accusing you of being a
white supremacist.

36:20.680 --> 36:21.840
What?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.720
We have to get going, we've got a
big problem.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.600
I know, I've got a problem right here.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.760
Yeah, but this one won't put you
in jail.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.640
..black people by reinforcing

36:29.640 --> 36:33.880
inherited white supremacist systems
of oppression.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.560
But I'm... I'm not. I...I don't even
know what that means.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.000
I think that's part of the problem.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.640
Can we talk about why we are really
down here today?

36:40.640 --> 36:42.920
This one says, "Does Lady Gabby
seriously think

36:42.920 --> 36:45.480
"people of colour need her to save
them?"

36:45.480 --> 36:47.280
I mean, I'm trying to.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.640
OK, let's go. Lady Gabby...

36:48.640 --> 36:50.920
Where's Greg? He normally handles
these things.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.600
Where's Greg? Lady Gabby.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.200
Lady Gabby, are you a white
supremacist?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.880
Does your silence mean yes?

36:56.880 --> 36:58.160
No!

36:58.160 --> 37:04.920
Telephone! Go home! Shut up.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.360
When were you born?

37:07.720 --> 37:09.320
You can answer that at least.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.960
The 12th of August 2003.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.480
So, you're 18 years old.

37:14.720 --> 37:16.800
You'll be charged as an adult.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.520
That means prison.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.280
Do you know how long you get for
armed robbery?

37:21.280 --> 37:22.640
Five to ten years.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.880
You will get done for this.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.480
You'll go to prison...

37:33.800 --> 37:36.440
..or you can co-operate and I can
help you.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.400
If you don't, they will charge you
with armed robbery,

37:39.400 --> 37:41.880
and once they charge you, I can't
help you.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.760
Do you want me to help
you?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.920
Myrna Okeke, Bristol Justice Collective.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.280
You're holding a young man named
Tyler Levison.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.360
We demand to speak to him immediately.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.160
Well, hurry up.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.720
Chop, chop!

37:59.720 --> 38:02.320
Do you think you're ready for
prison?

38:02.320 --> 38:05.200
Locked up for 23 hours a day.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.360
Rat-infested.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.600
It's overcrowded

38:09.600 --> 38:10.920
and I hope you like a ruck

38:10.920 --> 38:14.360
because they will beat you down the
minute they look at you.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.400
That's if you don't kill yourself first.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.360
Lots of suicides in prison.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.040
Tyler Levison's being spoken to by
an officer

38:31.040 --> 38:32.440
and has a duty solicitor present.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.680
Oh, well, that won't do.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.920
Yeah, well, it's going to have
to. Goodbye.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.680
Do you want me to get on social
media?

38:37.680 --> 38:41.000
Tell them that Bristol and Avon
Police are holding a young black man

38:41.000 --> 38:45.400
and refusing to give him access to
independent, free legal counsel?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.160
There'll be a mob outside
in an hour.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.920
He's not black.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.400
Twitter won't care.

38:53.440 --> 38:56.360
Christian Taylor, heard of him?

38:56.360 --> 38:57.960
Ran Brook Hill.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.040
He's inside now and he told me,
in his cell,

39:01.040 --> 39:04.240
whenever anyone above him pulls
the flush,

39:04.240 --> 39:06.360
their shit bubbles up in his toilet.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.600
Fancy staring at other people's shit
for five to ten years?

39:19.760 --> 39:21.120
What do you want to know?

39:21.120 --> 39:22.360
Who are you dealing for?

39:24.880 --> 39:27.200
Knock, knock. Don't say another
word, Tyler.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.520
What's going on?

39:28.520 --> 39:31.320
Well, as a solicitor working with
the Bristol Justice Collective

39:31.320 --> 39:33.640
and given the ongoing miscarriages
of justice

39:33.640 --> 39:35.000
by the police in this city,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.360
I am providing this young man
with free legal counsel.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.600
So, I'd like to speak to my client
in private, please,

39:39.600 --> 39:41.000
if you don't mind.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.600
Off we go.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.880
Quick as you can.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.400
I normally get paid by the hour but
I'm doing this pro bono,

39:46.400 --> 39:47.640
so I'm losing money.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.120
Why did you let him in?

39:49.120 --> 39:51.800
They were threatening to put
something on Twitter.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.040
Fair enough.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.840
What have you told her?

39:56.840 --> 39:59.480
I ain't sayin' nothing to you, too.
I don't know you.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.040
Well, my name's Greg and I'm your
new lawyer.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.400
I like pork pies...

40:04.400 --> 40:07.080
..good manners, anything starring
Martin Clunes.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.240
I hate racism, homophobia,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.440
and when you leave tissues in your
trouser pockets,

40:11.440 --> 40:13.280
and then put them in the washing machine.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.720
Yeah, that sucks. Right, exactly.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.960
So, you know everything about
me now. We trust each other.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.360
What did you tell her? Nothin'.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.440
OK, good. Well, if you continue to
say nothing,

40:20.440 --> 40:21.560
I can get you out of here.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.120
OK. All right? But you have to tell
me, what did she want to know?

40:24.120 --> 40:26.600
They said they're going to charge
me with armed robbery,

40:26.600 --> 40:28.760
unless I 'fess up about some dealing
I done.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.640
OK, who did you rob? Some posh twat
in some twatty flat.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.520
He kept going on about his Patek Philippe

40:34.520 --> 40:35.800
and it was getting on my tits.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.280
I can see how it would, yeah. Do you
remember where he lived?

40:38.280 --> 40:41.560
Yeah. Raymond Gardens, number 22.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.960
You don't know his name, do you?

40:42.960 --> 40:44.400
His watch was engraved,

40:44.400 --> 40:47.920
"To Spencer, enjoy this fanny
magnet, love, Gramps".

40:47.920 --> 40:50.040
Did you say Spencer? Yeah.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.480
Hello? Hi, it's me.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.040
Excuse me, sir, your father said not to...

41:19.040 --> 41:20.880
Dad, I need to talk to you.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.200
Now's not a good time.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.240
No, please. I'm on my way to see Hilgard.

41:24.240 --> 41:26.720
Please, listen. Put me on probation.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.920
Cut my pay by a quarter. Whatever
you want.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.000
Just...just...

41:31.000 --> 41:33.120
..just take me back, please.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.680
You're begging. It's undignified.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.000
No, I'm not...

41:37.000 --> 41:38.600
I'm not begging, Dad.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.080
I am asking you...

41:41.080 --> 41:43.880
..for a second chance. Please.

41:43.880 --> 41:46.600
Listen, I...I will work every hour
God sends.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.880
What would that teach you?

41:48.880 --> 41:50.080
Teach me?

41:50.080 --> 41:52.480
What more do I need to fucking
learn?!

41:54.880 --> 41:56.160
Sorry.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.480
Sorry, I just...

42:01.680 --> 42:03.160
I'm on my arse here, mate.

42:05.400 --> 42:09.240
Really, truly, and I need your help.

42:10.440 --> 42:14.320
I don't deny you're on your arse but
you're not coming back.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.920
Then what am I going to do?

42:16.920 --> 42:18.880
You will do what I did.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.320
Pull yourself up by your bloody bootstraps.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.360
Lady Gabriella
Penrose-Howe,

42:38.360 --> 42:42.880
the social media influencer, dubbed
"the it-girl for the IT generation",

42:42.880 --> 42:44.400
faces a powerful backlash,

42:44.400 --> 42:48.200
following a livestreamed interview
with a local woman of colour

42:48.200 --> 42:52.120
that many say revealed her white
saviour complex.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.160
Abigail Knightly is from a nonprofit group,

42:55.160 --> 42:59.840
fighting poverty and modern slavery
through art and dance.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.640
Abigail, you're one of those

43:01.640 --> 43:04.600
who was deeply upset
by Her Ladyship's words.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.520
Yeah, I mean, my sister sent me the video

43:06.520 --> 43:08.360
and I was just immediately triggered.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.400
We do not need any more rich,

43:10.400 --> 43:14.800
narcissistic white saviours coming
down to "the ghetto"

43:14.800 --> 43:17.200
to rescue impoverished people
of colour,

43:17.200 --> 43:19.320
so that they can feel better about themselves

43:19.320 --> 43:21.480
and get more likes on Instagram.

43:21.480 --> 43:25.280
If you agree, please do follow me -
@AbiKnightly.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.520
Well, Lady Gabriella, who first
became famous

43:28.520 --> 43:31.600
after she was spotted twerking with
Prince Harry

43:31.600 --> 43:33.400
in Ibiza eight years ago,

43:33.400 --> 43:37.440
is currently inside this building,
refusing to speak to reporters.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.360
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.280
Diane, it's me. Do I know you?

43:42.280 --> 43:43.720
It's Myrna.

43:43.720 --> 43:46.000
Myrna, hi!

43:46.000 --> 43:47.920
Whoa, why is your head so big?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.040
It's normal size.

43:49.040 --> 43:50.360
Is it?

43:50.360 --> 43:51.560
Cool.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.400
Hey, hey, look at my hands.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.720
They've turned into feet.

43:57.600 --> 43:58.880
Big feet.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.160
What happened to the protest?

44:07.160 --> 44:09.680
Myrna, I was only trying to help.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.400
Why are you hiding in here?

44:11.400 --> 44:13.760
We're not hiding. We're formulating
a response.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.280
And that takes a committee, does it?

44:15.280 --> 44:17.960
This is a democracy, Myrna.
The group has to speak as one.

44:17.960 --> 44:19.920
We should never have brought her in.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.480
I knew this was going to happen.
I said that, didn't I?

44:22.480 --> 44:23.920
I'm so sorry.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.360
You were right, we know.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.200
We've just written her a statement.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.520
All in agreement, say "Aye".

44:33.520 --> 44:34.640
Aye.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.440
♪ It's easy to fall in love

44:40.440 --> 44:43.200
♪ When you fall in love
you know you're done

44:43.200 --> 44:45.400

45:22.640 --> 45:24.520
A quick word, Lady Gabby.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.400
I have prepared a statement.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.120
Through my recent insensitive remarks,

45:33.520 --> 45:39.040
I have reinforced the damaging
stereotype of the white person

45:39.040 --> 45:42.160
as the benevolent agent of change and...

45:42.160 --> 45:47.040
..and people of colour as the
passive others

45:47.040 --> 45:49.640
in need of my charity.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.480
This goes against everything

45:51.480 --> 45:54.200
the Bristol Justice Collective
stands for,

45:54.200 --> 45:58.120
and so, consequently, I am...

45:58.120 --> 46:01.080
..stepping away from all involvement
with the group.

46:01.080 --> 46:06.960
I am so deeply sorry for the hurt
and pain I have caused.

46:08.160 --> 46:12.560
I will be taking time to reflect and...

46:13.840 --> 46:15.600
..to educate myself.

46:17.600 --> 46:18.800
Thank you.

46:18.800 --> 46:22.200
Lady Gabby, white saviour complex is
a symptom of white supremacy,

46:22.200 --> 46:24.760
which was used to justify the slave trade.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.760
Are you a white supremacist?

46:26.760 --> 46:28.120
I don't think so.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.960
You don't think so. So, you might
be?

46:29.960 --> 46:32.800
No, you're twisting my words.
That is enough.

46:32.800 --> 46:36.280
I am the founder of the Bristol
Justice Collective

46:36.280 --> 46:40.160
and I refuse to accept Lady Gabby's
resignation.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.160
And what's your name? Myrna Okeke.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.520
How do you spell that?

46:44.520 --> 46:47.040
You're a reporter, Google it.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.800
Do you know what? This is fake news.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.080
The real story is, why aren't you
news people

46:54.080 --> 46:56.400
camped outside the council offices,

46:56.400 --> 47:00.240
asking the politicians why they're
accepting money

47:00.240 --> 47:02.800
from a multinational
telecommunications company,

47:02.800 --> 47:05.440
who pay zero tax in this country...

47:05.440 --> 47:08.040
Yeah! ..so they can knock
down this community centre

47:08.040 --> 47:10.480
and put up a mobile phone mast?
Yeah.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.680
We wouldn't know about any of that,
if it wasn't for Gabby.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.760
I've been fighting white supremacy
for 40 years,

47:17.760 --> 47:23.040
and let me tell you something, this
woman ain't no white supremacist.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.880
She's just trying to raise some
money to save this building.

47:26.880 --> 47:31.440
So, put your phones away, put your
hands in your pockets - thanks -

47:31.440 --> 47:33.160

Not the racist ones or the corrupt ones...

48:09.280 --> 48:11.440
..or the ones that beat confessions
out of people,

48:11.440 --> 48:13.680
but ones like you seem absolutely...

48:16.000 --> 48:17.720
It's three o'clock.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.920
I'd have a little conversation
with your solicitor,

48:19.920 --> 48:21.640
because at 3:30, I'm walking back
in here,

48:21.640 --> 48:23.120
and if you don't start talking,

48:23.120 --> 48:25.640
I'm having you charged with armed robbery.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.000
That's five to ten years of bubbling shit.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.240
You said you'd sort this.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.320
I am.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.160
Well, you've got 30 minutes or I'm
singing like Beyonce.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.360
Sure you want to do this?

48:50.360 --> 48:52.040
Is there another way?

48:52.040 --> 48:55.560
This'll be like role-play, yeah?
Like WWE.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.560
We're not going to hurt him for real.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.920
Oh.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.680
Hello?

49:17.680 --> 49:19.960
Hi, it's Detective
Sergeant Haines.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.440
Can I have a word, please?

49:21.440 --> 49:22.880
Er...

49:22.880 --> 49:24.200
Yeah, OK.

49:28.800 --> 49:29.920
Er...

49:43.320 --> 49:45.840
What? Urgh!

49:45.840 --> 49:47.200
Argh!

49:48.960 --> 49:51.760
Make a sound and I'll slit your
throat. You got it?

49:51.760 --> 49:54.280
Take anything you want but I was
literally robbed yesterday,

49:54.280 --> 49:55.640
so I haven't got much left.

49:55.640 --> 49:58.560
Look, I don't want your stuff.
I want you to drop the charges.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.760
What? The boy that robbed you,
I want you to drop all the charges.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.200
I...I can't. I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.640
No, no, I can't, I can't.
The copper's already suspicious.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.240
If I drop the charges, she'll know
something's up.

50:24.600 --> 50:28.800
You're going to do what we say or
I'm going to break your arm.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.160
You're not serious?

50:30.160 --> 50:32.240
Hold his arm out straight.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.200
Hold his arm
out straight!

50:51.320 --> 50:54.200
OK, sunshine, that's it.
Final warning.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.360
I'm charging you with aggravated robbery,

50:56.360 --> 50:59.040
unless you tell me right now, who
are you dealing for?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.240
I... DS Haines. What?!

51:25.360 --> 51:26.560
What do you want?

51:26.560 --> 51:27.920
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.640
The man you have is totally innocent.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.160
I withdraw all charges fully.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.520
Who got to you?

51:34.520 --> 51:35.960
I...I don't know what you mean.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.720
That watch just means so much to me,
so I just wanted someone blamed,

51:38.720 --> 51:40.840
so I picked a random kid out of the
line-up.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.040
Get out. Yes, ma'am.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.240
I don't suppose you found the
watch...? Get out!

52:02.720 --> 52:03.880
Shall I put eyes on him?

52:03.880 --> 52:06.000
It's pointless.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.920
Whoever's running him knows he's hot now.

52:07.920 --> 52:09.160
They'll stand him down.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.760
I blew our one bloody lead.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.360
Well, we may have another.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.200
You know PC Lane? No.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.920
Big guy, squiffy eye. Oh, yeah.

52:20.920 --> 52:24.400
Yeah, well, his gran got this random
text -

52:24.400 --> 52:28.520
"Party all weekend with Columbian
coffee, 100% pure.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.440
"Flat white - 80 quid.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.560
"Rock harder with double
espresso - 150."

52:33.560 --> 52:36.040
That's some pricey coffee.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.120
Yeah, I'll check it out.

52:45.240 --> 52:48.640
Wow, people are so generous.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.520
Look at all these 50s.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.240
Amazing.

53:17.840 --> 53:21.960
Only four weeks left, until The Dean
needs his money.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.440
He's worried you're falling behind schedule.

53:24.440 --> 53:27.520
So, he's asked us to come and give
you a little kick up the arse.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.040
You weren't seriously going to break
his arm, were you?

53:47.160 --> 53:48.480
If that's what it took.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.280
You can't be serious.

53:52.280 --> 53:54.360
You said it yourself, we have no choice.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.560
We always have a choice -

53:56.560 --> 53:58.240
whether to cross the line or not.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.240
Just four more weeks, and then
we're done.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.360
All right, you keep saying we have
four more weeks,

54:02.360 --> 54:03.640
and then we're done,

54:03.640 --> 54:06.240
but what if we've crossed a line and
we can't go back?

54:11.360 --> 54:13.200
You didn't say if you were down.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.560
To what? My food shack idea.

54:18.760 --> 54:22.960
We'd need a lot of start-up money... Yeah.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.680
..and it would be difficult.

54:24.680 --> 54:27.000
Look, I could work extra shifts at
the club.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.160
And I'm going to talk to John about
mortgage structures

54:30.160 --> 54:31.760
and small business loans.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.360
You're not into this, are you?

54:50.880 --> 54:53.360
Look, I don't want to pressure you, Rani,

54:53.360 --> 54:56.520
but don't you want to make plans for
when all this shit's over?

54:56.520 --> 54:57.840
A food shack?

54:57.840 --> 55:00.760
You were the one that said I could
do this professionally.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.720
For the first time,

55:03.720 --> 55:07.920
someone said I could do something
other than just staying alive.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.080
What?

55:25.080 --> 55:27.160
I'll have two flat whites, please.

55:27.160 --> 55:31.200
Where are you? Bridge Street, by the water.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.840
Wearing what? Grey hoodie and blue jeans.

55:34.840 --> 55:36.360
30 minutes. Safe.

55:57.440 --> 56:03.400
How about I...ask my parents for a
loan to put down a deposit?

56:06.360 --> 56:08.040
Seriously?

56:08.040 --> 56:09.120
You'd do that?

56:10.560 --> 56:12.560
Course, you're my boyfriend.

56:24.440 --> 56:26.240
In response to the protest,

56:26.240 --> 56:28.600
a spokesman for Bristol City Council said

56:28.600 --> 56:31.840
they would hold a town hall meeting
with local residents

56:31.840 --> 56:35.960
and the telecommunications company
to discuss plans.

56:35.960 --> 56:39.520
The protest ended with a rather
unexpected example

56:39.520 --> 56:41.720
of police community outreach.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.200
This is the grasshopper.
Yeah!

56:44.200 --> 56:46.360
This the wheelbarrowYeah!

56:46.360 --> 56:49.040
Are you ready to see the Diane
- special?
- Yeah!

57:08.480 --> 57:09.760
You, yeah?

57:09.760 --> 57:11.320
All right, mate?

57:11.320 --> 57:14.360
What you sayin'? You all right?
Yeah, good, boss. How you doin'?

57:16.560 --> 57:18.160
Aight, take that and take that.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.680
All right? Cheers, boss.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.800
Have a good one, yeah? You too, man. Aight.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.240
All right, what have you got for me?

57:39.240 --> 57:42.440
He gave me these, which ain't very
on-brand.

57:43.920 --> 57:45.080
We cool?

57:45.080 --> 57:46.360
Cool. Cool.

57:51.360 --> 57:54.600
"Say no to drugs, stay clean
for good."
