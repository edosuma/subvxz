00:15.417 --> 00:19.291
(groaning) I am so sick of McFist.

00:19.375 --> 00:21.792
He's come after me
every day for two weeks.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.875
(Randy) Where do you think you're going?

00:25.208 --> 00:26.667
(yelling)

00:28.166 --> 00:30.000
(grunting)

00:31.750 --> 00:34.166
-(Randy chuckles)
-(McFist) Go on...

00:34.250 --> 00:36.917
-Huh?
-Take it!

00:37.000 --> 00:39.500
-Take it!
-(groaning)

00:39.583 --> 00:42.417
(belches) OK,
that last one was just insulting.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.834
I don't care what we do today,

00:43.917 --> 00:46.875
as long as it has zero percent
to do with Hannibal McFist.

00:46.959 --> 00:51.709
People of Norrisville, put your fist
together for the man of the hour,

00:51.792 --> 00:56.041
-Hannibal McFist!
-(people cheering)

00:56.125 --> 00:59.083
What? A festival? In honor of me?

00:59.166 --> 01:01.417
And the 50th anniversary of McSquiddles?

01:01.500 --> 01:03.500
-But mostly me?
-(groans)

01:03.583 --> 01:06.291
Viceroy, you rascal, you shouldn't have!

01:06.375 --> 01:09.291
-But you told me to.
-I'm sure I didn't!

01:09.375 --> 01:10.792
(people cheering)

01:10.875 --> 01:14.625
-Howard, did you know about this?
-I'm sure I didn't.

01:14.709 --> 01:17.083
(laughing) Yay!

01:17.166 --> 01:21.291
A half century ago,
my father launched an empire with this:

01:21.375 --> 01:24.291
the first McSquiddle!

01:24.375 --> 01:26.500
-(people oohing)
-It's meat-flavored.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.709
Oh, McSquiddle Zero!

01:28.792 --> 01:31.000
Original! Original flavor!

01:31.083 --> 01:33.291
I've tasted every one but you.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.208
Today that will change.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.291
Look at him. What a jerk-wad.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.166
-(crowd cheering)
-There you go, McSquiddy.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.542
Enjoy your day. Well, our day.

01:41.625 --> 01:43.291
Actually, it's my day.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.625
(cheering)

01:46.709 --> 01:48.750
If these people knew
what I knew about McFist,

01:48.834 --> 01:50.166
they'd cheer a different tune.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.500
One that goes "Boo!"

01:52.583 --> 01:56.500
Cunningham, nobody cheers like that.
Besides, they love the guy.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.000
-There's nothing you can do about it.
-Oh, yes there is.

01:59.083 --> 02:02.583
I could expose that lying liar
for the Ninja-hating Ninja-hater he is!

02:03.959 --> 02:05.667
Just one second, I'm so sorry.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.458
Whoa!

02:14.667 --> 02:17.041
-(giggles)
-(angry buzzing)

02:17.125 --> 02:18.709
(screams)

02:18.792 --> 02:20.625
Oh, that's gotta sting.

02:21.792 --> 02:26.333
"Provoke your enemy and he will
fight back." That's right, Nomicon!

02:26.417 --> 02:29.375
McFist has poked this hornets' nest
one too many time.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.291
I'm the nest! Provoked!

02:32.375 --> 02:33.667
(screams) Garbage Cat!

02:35.041 --> 02:36.458
Yes!

02:37.125 --> 02:38.792
(giggles)

02:38.875 --> 02:41.166
-Say "McSquiddle."
-McSquiddle!

02:41.250 --> 02:43.417
(all gasping)

02:43.500 --> 02:44.792
(sighs)

02:45.625 --> 02:47.709
(sighs) I can't wait to smell it.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.041
Maybe lick it a little.
I gotta get a taste...

02:50.125 --> 02:53.750
That's right! Get a pic
with the most beloved man in town!

02:53.834 --> 02:57.000
(chuckles) The Ninja... The Ninja! Ah...

02:57.083 --> 03:00.166
I meant, me!
Me is what we're commemorating.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.583
(growls)

03:03.750 --> 03:06.208
(screams) If he messes up my day...

03:06.291 --> 03:08.959
-If he messes up my day...
-(Ninja) Smoke bomb!

03:09.041 --> 03:10.959
(audience cheering)

03:11.041 --> 03:13.500
-Ah! Get him!
-(audience goes silent)

03:13.583 --> 03:15.750
Hannibal, everyone's watching...

03:15.834 --> 03:19.583
Uh... I mean, hey!
How's the ninja biz treating you?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.291
Don't play McFriendly with me, McFist.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.458
I'm here to show these good people

03:23.542 --> 03:25.750
that you're an evil villain
out to wonk the Ninja!

03:25.834 --> 03:28.750
-(people murmuring)
-Don't take that from him.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.709
You're a benevolent business man.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.375
You would say that, Viceroy.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.458
You created all of his W.N.D.'s!

03:34.542 --> 03:36.667
(silence)

03:36.750 --> 03:39.166
Weapons of Ninja Destruction.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.125
-Ooh...
-Solid acronym.

03:41.208 --> 03:45.458
Everything McFist makes is
secretly designed to destroy the Ninja!

03:45.542 --> 03:46.458
(gasping)

03:46.542 --> 03:48.959
Like this McFro-Yo stand.

03:49.041 --> 03:52.125
Switch it this way,
vanilla, but this way...

03:52.208 --> 03:53.792
It's chocolate?

03:53.875 --> 03:55.792
OK, but what about when I do this!

03:55.875 --> 03:57.792
-(groans)
-It's swirl.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.625
-Who doesn't love a swirl?
-(cheering)

03:59.709 --> 04:01.333
Oh...

04:01.417 --> 04:04.458
OK, all right,
but what about this hat stand?

04:04.542 --> 04:06.458
There's no way these are just hats.

04:06.542 --> 04:09.500
Come on, I'm right here.
You wanna destroy me?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.125
You just gonna hold hats
like some kinda kiosk?

04:12.208 --> 04:13.417
-(grunting)
-(people murmuring)

04:13.500 --> 04:15.458
That's what I call a crime of fashion.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.709
That's what I call a crime of fashion!

04:17.792 --> 04:20.959
-(people laughing)
-Huh? The statue, of course!

04:21.041 --> 04:23.125
-Ninja Tengu Fireball!
-(gasping)

04:24.458 --> 04:27.250
-Ah! My statue!
-Oh, boy.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.291
That wasn't a weapon. (grunts)

04:29.375 --> 04:30.583
(gasps)

04:30.667 --> 04:32.375
(screams)

04:32.458 --> 04:33.875
Squiddy!

04:38.583 --> 04:40.417
(both) No!

04:40.500 --> 04:44.750
-(crying)
-You've gone too far this time, Ninja.

04:44.834 --> 04:48.041
These people will never believe
that their lovable gazillionaire

04:48.125 --> 04:49.834
is actually your arch enemy!

04:49.917 --> 04:51.250
(crowd murmuring)

04:51.333 --> 04:53.875
-Uh, Hannibal...
-Hold on, Viceroy.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.583
Ninja, I'm going to destroy you.

04:56.667 --> 04:59.083
-(all gasping)
-I'm going to blast you to pieces.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.333
-(gasps)
-Not cool.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.166
Hannibal, your microphone's on.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.417
And then I'm going to blast
those pieces to pieces!

05:05.792 --> 05:07.333
Everybody can hear you!

05:07.417 --> 05:11.291
(gasps) Uh... eh... ooh...

05:11.375 --> 05:14.875
-McFist is a bad guy!
-He wants to destroy the Ninja!

05:14.959 --> 05:17.750
No, it's not how it sounded. It's a joke.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.291
Uh, we were just wonking around.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.208
-Boo!
-(all booing)

05:22.291 --> 05:24.083
Stop it. Stop it!

05:25.291 --> 05:26.291
Uh...

05:26.375 --> 05:29.417
(gasps) Ah!

05:29.500 --> 05:33.750
What? The one time I don't want
McSquiddles to rain from the sky.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.000
Not meat... not meat...

05:36.083 --> 05:38.792
-Not even candy.
-(people booing)

05:40.583 --> 05:44.875
I did it! (humming)

05:44.959 --> 05:46.542
Everybody hates McFist.

05:46.625 --> 05:49.917
-Not me. I hate you.
-Huh?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.083
-(people booing)
-Look at them. I was beloved.

05:53.166 --> 05:57.166
And now I'm... loved? Unloved?
What's the opposite of beloved?

05:57.250 --> 06:00.458
-You.
-Oh, that hurt.

06:00.542 --> 06:03.750
Why don't I put on your favorite program.
That'll cheer you up.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.917
Ooh.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.417
<i>Newsflash, Weiner-peeps!</i>
<i>My twog's blowin' up!</i>

06:07.500 --> 06:09.375
<i>Everyone's boycotting McFist Industries.</i>

06:10.041 --> 06:11.750
<i>It's the thing to do!</i>

06:11.834 --> 06:13.792
I'm sure it's not that bad.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.667
<i>It's way bad! McFist Industries</i>
<i>has a one-way ticket to Splart City!</i>

06:17.750 --> 06:20.875
-Oh!
-Hannibal? Sir?

06:20.959 --> 06:23.333
I've never been splarted in my life!

06:23.417 --> 06:26.917
(sobs)

06:27.000 --> 06:29.959
-Oh my...
-(wailing)

06:30.041 --> 06:32.333
Sadness. Is he...

06:32.417 --> 06:33.834
Yes, he is.

06:33.917 --> 06:37.875
This is... unexpected.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.542
Awkward is what it is.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.625
The whole town turned on me.

06:41.709 --> 06:47.125
And I lost Squiddy!
On the Squidtennial! I'm ruined! (sobs)

06:47.208 --> 06:50.125
You are, aren't you?

06:50.208 --> 06:53.333
Your loss is my gain.

06:53.417 --> 06:55.542
(grunting, exclaiming)

06:58.208 --> 06:59.667
(screeching)

07:01.125 --> 07:01.959
(screams)

07:02.667 --> 07:05.083
McFist is a bad guy?

07:05.166 --> 07:08.041
Skee-wow, man. Skee. Wow.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.250
McFist pokes the hornet's nest?

07:10.333 --> 07:13.208
McFist gets stung! Ninja win!

07:13.291 --> 07:16.250
I tricked you into coming to this
festival so that I could have a good time,

07:16.333 --> 07:18.875
and now you're having my good time!

07:18.959 --> 07:20.500
I hope this comes back on you.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.166
(gasps) You take that back!

07:22.250 --> 07:24.333
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean it.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.083
You know,
that was just a low meat-sugar talking.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.458
Ah! That Garbage Cat
has the Meat-Squiddle!

07:28.542 --> 07:30.959
-Get back here!
-This will not come back on me.

07:31.041 --> 07:34.166
-(loud growling)
-Coming back on me!

07:35.417 --> 07:39.625
-What the juice!
-(growling)

07:45.291 --> 07:46.583
Ninja Chaku!

07:47.208 --> 07:48.417
Hi-yah!

07:50.625 --> 07:53.417
Stanked McFist? But this is his fault!

07:53.500 --> 07:56.041
He poked the hornet's nest!

07:56.125 --> 07:57.792
(gulps)

07:57.875 --> 07:59.625
(grunting)

08:00.166 --> 08:02.458
(screams)

08:02.542 --> 08:05.166
Uh-oh. (screams)

08:05.250 --> 08:07.875
(laughs) I can feel it.

08:07.959 --> 08:10.750
The chaos! What's happening out there?

08:10.834 --> 08:12.625
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

08:12.709 --> 08:15.917
-(growls)
-This just might work.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.875
Ninja Sai Stopper!

08:23.750 --> 08:25.709
Ninja Pyramid Sprint!

08:25.792 --> 08:27.500
(growls)

08:32.083 --> 08:34.250
Ninja Slipping Balls!

08:36.875 --> 08:39.208
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.542
Give me the McSquiddle, Garbage Cat.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.667
-(hisses)
-That's it.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.583
(cat screeching)

08:44.667 --> 08:47.291
Yes! Yes! I got it!

08:47.375 --> 08:51.208
It's raining cats! Skee-meow, man!
Skee-meow!

08:51.291 --> 08:52.875
(grunts)

08:52.959 --> 08:55.291
How do I de-stank Hannibal McFist?

08:55.375 --> 08:57.291
Couldn't be less interested.

08:57.375 --> 09:01.333
An entire empire was built on this
50 year old meat-flavored ball of wax!

09:01.417 --> 09:03.333
And I'm gonna eat it!

09:03.417 --> 09:05.000
(howls)

09:06.417 --> 09:08.542
That's it! It's the McSquiddle!

09:08.625 --> 09:11.250
Howard! No!

09:13.125 --> 09:15.041
(belches) Why did I eat that?

09:15.125 --> 09:17.875
-(howls)
-Yes, why did you eat that?

09:17.959 --> 09:19.750
It's only the thing he holds most...

09:22.917 --> 09:25.041
Sorry, Howard.
I gotta poke the hornet's nest.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.667
Ninja Pukin' Poke!

09:34.834 --> 09:38.458
Hannibal,
as long as people love McSquiddles,

09:38.542 --> 09:40.875
they'll love McFist Industries.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.542
Boy, keep your hands
away from that conveyor belt!

09:43.625 --> 09:46.208
-You can lose an arm!
-(whistles)

09:48.792 --> 09:51.417
(growling)

09:51.959 --> 09:54.333
(groans) What happened?

09:54.417 --> 09:55.875
I poked the hornet's nest.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.000
Instead of protecting Norrisville,
I almost shoobed it.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.917
I see your mouth moving,
but everything's like "blah blah blah."

10:02.000 --> 10:04.083
I have to unpoke the hornet's nest.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.083
Whoa! There's a brain in my arm!

10:06.166 --> 10:08.875
OK, hey! It's just the stank-nesia, folks!

10:08.959 --> 10:13.166
Turns out McFist was only trying
to destroy me because he was a monster.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.250
I was wrong. Honest mistake.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.625
You know, it happens.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.709
I turned into a monster once.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.166
-Me, too!
-(all agreeing)

10:20.250 --> 10:22.542
Don't know what your angle is, Ninja,

10:22.625 --> 10:24.792
but I'm still gonna take you down.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.291
I just have one thing to say...

10:27.375 --> 10:30.667
What? You're giving
free McFistPads to everyone?

10:30.750 --> 10:33.500
But won't that cost you a fortune?

10:33.583 --> 10:35.667
Is this guy great or what, right?

10:35.750 --> 10:38.458
Boycott's over. Hip-hip, McSquiddles!

10:38.542 --> 10:40.375
(all cheering)

10:40.458 --> 10:44.083
Smoke bomb!

10:44.166 --> 10:45.750
(coughing) Oh!

10:45.834 --> 10:48.000
We're talking about
the new McFistPads, right?

10:48.083 --> 10:48.959
(growls)

10:49.041 --> 10:50.792
(Sorcerer) What happened?

10:50.875 --> 10:52.625
What's going on down there?

10:52.709 --> 10:54.667
-I don't wanna tell you.
-Tell me!

10:54.750 --> 10:56.250
The Ninja won.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.250
(Sorcerer screams)

10:59.333 --> 11:01.583
(Viceroy) That's why
I didn't want to tell you.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.500
(screaming)

11:07.333 --> 11:09.625
You're right, Nomicon.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.709
I shoobed this one hard and it might've
gone better if I'd listened to you.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.834
(screaming)

11:14.917 --> 11:17.917
OK, fine. It definitely
would've gone better if I listened to you.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.875
From now on, I'll do whatever you say.

11:20.959 --> 11:24.041
That's right! I'm going Full-Nomicon!

11:24.792 --> 11:28.542
NinjaNomicon says
"No go on the chicken parm."

11:28.625 --> 11:30.166
Really? That's what it said?

11:30.250 --> 11:33.417
Well, actually it said,
"A Ninja without balance will fall."

11:33.500 --> 11:36.625
Since I had the parm yesterday, I gotta
balance it out with Stroganoff today.

11:36.709 --> 11:38.458
Full-Nomicon!

11:40.083 --> 11:42.083
Ugh. Better you than me.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.333
-How's Full-Nomicon tasting?
-(gulping)

11:46.417 --> 11:48.083
Pretty bad. Ugh.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.667
But it's worth it if it makes me
a better ninja.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.917
Your Nomicon-ing is out of control!

11:53.000 --> 11:55.709
You can't make a single decision
without shloomping into that book!

11:55.792 --> 11:57.458
When? Name one time.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.917
Shower or no shower?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.709
I didn't sweat much yesterday.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.417
Better shloomp on it.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.917
Um...

12:06.834 --> 12:09.041
A or C? A or C...

12:09.125 --> 12:10.542
Better shloomp on it.

12:10.625 --> 12:11.875
(grunts)

12:14.083 --> 12:15.709
You goin' parm or Stroganoff?

12:15.792 --> 12:17.375
Better shloomp on it.

12:19.542 --> 12:21.542
You can't count that one,
it just happened.

12:21.625 --> 12:25.166
Besides, when you go Full-Nomicon,
you go Full-Nomicon.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.750
That's why it's called Full-Nomicon.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.208
Look, I can't talk about this anymore.

12:28.291 --> 12:30.375
I need to focus on something important.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.250
Barely Berry or ReChunkulous.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.125
(Randy) Better shloomp on it!

12:40.375 --> 12:42.959
Let's talk dessert, Nomicon.
What should I get?

12:43.041 --> 12:45.291
"A Ninja without balance will fall."

12:45.375 --> 12:47.375
Right. Which is what you said last time.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.375
So... Barely Berry?
Is that what we're thinking?

12:51.625 --> 12:53.166
OK, ReChunkulous!

12:53.250 --> 12:55.875
Listen,
I'm trying to go Full-Nomicon here,

12:55.959 --> 12:57.959
but I do not know what you're saying!

13:02.625 --> 13:06.250
Oh, OK. Ask myself. Gotcha. OK, me...

13:06.333 --> 13:09.875
I'm leaning ReChunkulous,
but honestly... (grunts)

13:11.000 --> 13:13.917
Pardon me, me, but what the juice?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.083
Ah!

13:16.166 --> 13:18.583
OK, Nomicon, you're in charge!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.542
Now what do I do?

13:20.625 --> 13:21.667
Hello?

13:23.125 --> 13:25.709
What am I doing to me?

13:25.792 --> 13:27.875
No! No!

13:31.291 --> 13:34.333
All right, drop it on me.
How's the Nomicon gonna wonk up fro-yo?

13:34.417 --> 13:36.625
Yo, who cares what the book says.

13:36.709 --> 13:40.792
(gasps) Wait. You're going... No-Nomicon?

13:40.875 --> 13:43.000
I'm going Barely-Chunk!

13:43.083 --> 13:45.792
-(gulping)
-(girls groan)

13:45.875 --> 13:47.875
(giggles) Cunningham's back!

13:47.959 --> 13:51.166
I love it! Whoa! Whoa!
Slow down, save me some!

13:55.250 --> 13:57.750
OK, Nomicon, time to untie me.

13:57.834 --> 14:00.166
I learned my lesson. It's, um...

14:01.208 --> 14:02.709
OK, I didn't learn my lesson,

14:02.792 --> 14:04.709
but we can still lose the ropes here.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.458
All right, balance...

14:07.542 --> 14:10.333
Balance, balance...

14:10.417 --> 14:12.208
(grunts)

14:13.250 --> 14:15.000
(Randy) Hey, lookin' good, girl.

14:15.083 --> 14:16.542
What's up, P-Slims?

14:18.417 --> 14:20.250
-How you doin'?
-It's me!

14:20.333 --> 14:22.208
But it can't be me! I'm in here!

14:22.291 --> 14:25.792
If I'm in here then
that's gotta be... Nomi-Randy.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.875
You ran into me.
Now I gotta be mean to you!

14:34.959 --> 14:36.709
Uh-oh. This is going to hurt.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.250
Yo, you sure about that?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.750
(dance music plays)

14:40.834 --> 14:42.417
(students gasping)

14:45.250 --> 14:47.792
Uh... You confused me with your dancing!

14:47.875 --> 14:50.709
I'm gonna leave you alone
until I can figure out what your deal is!

14:51.542 --> 14:53.375
No-Nomicon is the cheese!

14:53.458 --> 14:57.458
Wow, Randy. You have the Bruce-est moves.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.291
(chuckles)

14:59.375 --> 15:00.959
Yo, what's up, Weiner-babe.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.709
Girl, how 'bout you and I get together

15:02.792 --> 15:06.041
and turn your Me-Cast into a We-Cast!

15:07.875 --> 15:09.417
(crying)

15:09.500 --> 15:11.750
(sniffs) Ah...

15:11.834 --> 15:17.667
Nothing tastes as sweet
as the scent of a broken heart.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.166
(sniffs)

15:25.250 --> 15:27.333
My sister, Cunningham.

15:27.417 --> 15:30.083
Remember when I said
I like you going No-Nomicon?

15:30.166 --> 15:33.667
I take it back. Do! Not! Like it!

15:33.750 --> 15:35.166
(growling)

15:37.000 --> 15:39.625
And don't think we're done
just because you have to go Ninja.

15:39.709 --> 15:44.458
Who's going to Ninja? I'm hitting
the Game Hole. C'mon. My treat.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.792
Can you do that? Don't answer that!

15:46.875 --> 15:49.000
Let's just go. I'm lovin' the No-Nomicon.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.667
Again!

15:50.750 --> 15:54.083
Why aren't I stopping her?
Oh, right. That's not me.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.709
I'm me! And I'm tied to a chair!

15:56.792 --> 15:58.542
(grunts)

16:00.083 --> 16:02.041
I don't get it. I went Full-Nomicon.

16:02.125 --> 16:05.667
Why aren't you telling me what to do?
Just tell me what to do!

16:05.750 --> 16:07.667
(chuckles) Oh, nice!

16:07.750 --> 16:11.125
You delivered a sack of punches
to the whole graveyard!

16:11.208 --> 16:13.458
(video game) <i>Make your feet ready.</i>
<i>Time to run from dogs!</i>

16:13.542 --> 16:15.959
And here's where you lose.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.583
You stink at run from dogs!

16:18.667 --> 16:20.166
(video game) <i>These dogs are fed.</i>

16:20.250 --> 16:22.208
<i>Your sack is filled two times!</i>

16:22.291 --> 16:24.375
You did it! Slap it out.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.041
Cunningham whiffed the slap?

16:28.125 --> 16:30.041
He never whiffs a slap!

16:30.125 --> 16:33.291
Hitting on my sister.
Ignoring a monster. And now this?

16:34.250 --> 16:36.333
What the juice is up with him?

16:36.417 --> 16:39.333
Hm? You...

16:40.417 --> 16:41.875
Hm.

16:45.542 --> 16:49.250
Tell me what you did to my friend
or I'm going to take you for a walk

16:49.333 --> 16:51.834
down the back of my pants!

16:57.125 --> 16:59.792
I hate you!

16:59.875 --> 17:00.875
Yah!

17:00.959 --> 17:04.917
Howard! You freed me!
What are you doing in the Nomicon?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.125
I'm in the NinjaNomicon?

17:07.208 --> 17:11.000
So, my old enemy, we finally meet.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.583
Hm. Pretty roomy for a book.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.875
Hey. If you're in here. Who's out there?

17:16.959 --> 17:20.041
I call him Nomi-Randy, and he's bad news.

17:20.125 --> 17:24.083
Man, I am so glad that
wasn't you who hit on my sister.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.834
I did not wanna have that talk.

17:26.917 --> 17:29.166
-(screaming)
-(growling)

17:29.250 --> 17:31.208
-You have to fix this.
-I know.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.333
So, how are you going to fix this?

17:33.417 --> 17:36.083
I don't know.
Nomicon won't tell me what to do.

17:36.166 --> 17:39.041
It just keeps saying... that.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.500
(gasps)
Yeah, I don't get that at all.

17:41.583 --> 17:44.000
I know. Why do you think
I wonk up so much?

17:44.083 --> 17:45.917
I've been trying not to fall.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.041
Why do you think I went Full-Nomicon?

17:48.125 --> 17:50.834
Wait a minute...
That was too much Nomicon!

17:50.917 --> 17:53.291
But Nomi-Randy is no Nomicon.

17:53.375 --> 17:58.291
I need to go Half-Nomicon!
Boom! Bam! Boom! Balance!

17:58.375 --> 18:00.083
This is what you guys do in here?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.709
Cunningham, what are you doing?

18:01.792 --> 18:03.458
Getting my balance back!

18:06.291 --> 18:07.542
I'll be here!

18:08.750 --> 18:12.750
I did it. I'm out.
I'm... in Howard's body?

18:12.834 --> 18:15.709
(gasps) Man,
these things really are dainty.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.834
How'm I supposed to stop
my Nomi-self with these?

18:17.917 --> 18:19.083
You're not.

18:19.917 --> 18:23.125
Hey... me. Hand over my... self.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.917
No honkin' way. I like it here.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.458
We'll see how much
you like it when I do this!

18:28.542 --> 18:30.959
(grunts)

18:31.041 --> 18:34.250
(farts) I was supposed to kick you.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.458
Balance is a little off. Working
with a whole new center of gravity here.

18:37.542 --> 18:40.208
(laughs) Oof!

18:41.125 --> 18:44.250
Yeah, Cunningham! I mean, Weinerman.

18:44.333 --> 18:48.166
Cunning... man? Weinerham?
Whatever. Just get him!

18:48.250 --> 18:50.500
(screaming) I barely even know Andy!

18:50.583 --> 18:53.417
Randy! He named Randy!

18:53.500 --> 18:55.417
(laughing)

18:57.166 --> 19:00.834
Ooh! Down goes Nomi-Randy.
Feel like givin' up yet?

19:00.917 --> 19:04.125
I'm Randy Cunningham. I never give up.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.709
I'm Randy Cunningham.

19:07.792 --> 19:08.709
Oh, boy.

19:13.083 --> 19:15.583
-(grunts)
-(Nomi-Randy laughs)

19:18.041 --> 19:19.500
(screams)

19:21.166 --> 19:24.417
Must find a way out of Howard and into me.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.792
That is a weird thing to say. Yah!

19:26.875 --> 19:30.041
Oh, great. I'm gonna feel that tomorrow.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.417
Ha!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.709
You know at first
I wasn't sold on the scarf,

19:36.792 --> 19:38.625
but that thing looks so Bruce right now.

19:40.041 --> 19:42.291
Gotta get Nomi-Me out of me,
me out of Howard,

19:42.375 --> 19:46.750
Howard into Howard,
and me into me, but how?

19:50.667 --> 19:53.125
Nomicon Bag-alanche Throw!

19:53.208 --> 19:55.333
Don't make me say things like that!

20:01.959 --> 20:03.750
(both screaming)

20:05.917 --> 20:07.458
(both groaning)

20:07.542 --> 20:09.333
-Cunningham?
-Howard?

20:11.750 --> 20:14.667
-You're back!
-Yeah, I'm back. You back?

20:14.750 --> 20:16.875
-I'm back! We're both back!
-(whooping)

20:16.959 --> 20:18.500
(both) Yeah!

20:18.583 --> 20:20.625
I hate to kill the moment, but...

20:20.709 --> 20:22.166
Theresa Fowler. I'm on it.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.333
(grunts)

20:25.417 --> 20:27.583
Why is there so much garbage back here?

20:27.667 --> 20:31.959
Please, Teezie-Feezie!
You can't do this! We're total biffers!

20:32.041 --> 20:35.083
-Smoke bomb!
-Oh, Ninja, you got to waste this chick!

20:35.166 --> 20:37.208
-(growls)
-And I will...

20:37.291 --> 20:39.583
with my Ninja Bouquet.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.750
Theresa, these are,
um... so, there's this guy,

20:42.834 --> 20:44.959
Randy Cunningham, I think that's his name,

20:45.041 --> 20:48.417
and he... and there was...

20:48.500 --> 20:51.166
and he's sorry. Here!

20:51.250 --> 20:52.875
Randy?

20:55.125 --> 20:56.834
Randy... (sighs)

20:58.333 --> 21:01.625
I guess Sandy
isn't such a bad guy after all.

21:02.291 --> 21:06.000
It's Randy. Randy! I just met the guy.

21:06.083 --> 21:09.125
I know it's Randy. Am I wrong about this?

21:09.208 --> 21:11.792
Sheesh. Smoke bomb.

21:11.875 --> 21:13.625
(grunts)

21:13.709 --> 21:16.959
Some days it hardly seems worth it.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.959
Howard, being inside of you...

21:19.041 --> 21:21.041
Don't say that. Never say that again.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.542
...really taught me something.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.834
Being the perfect ninja
means listening to the Nomicon.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.375
But it also means listening to me.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.291
So, you're going half-Nomicon,
half-Cunningham.

21:31.375 --> 21:35.542
What would you call that?
Nomi-Ham? Cunning-Con?

21:35.625 --> 21:38.166
Let's just call it a swirl.

21:38.250 --> 21:41.166
Ooh! Like Barely-Chunk!

21:41.250 --> 21:43.417
(both) Barely-Chunk!

21:46.458 --> 21:47.709
(sighs)

21:48.291 --> 21:50.917
(theme music plays)
