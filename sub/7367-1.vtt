00:22.663 --> 00:24.248
I don't really pray...

00:24.540 --> 00:27.459
...but if you could just
help me out here...

00:27.793 --> 00:29.002
...I promise...

00:32.171 --> 00:33.757
105.

00:34.424 --> 00:35.759
105?

00:36.093 --> 00:37.177
Oh, my God!

00:38.220 --> 00:39.888
Run a bath, call the doctor.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.182
Get her into the bath.

00:42.683 --> 00:44.852
Dr. Carter, 655...

00:45.102 --> 00:46.228
He won 't be there.

00:46.728 --> 00:48.313
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

00:49.189 --> 00:52.067
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

00:52.317 --> 00:54.319
Susan. Susie.

00:55.779 --> 00:57.072
Mommy says get up now.

00:57.447 --> 00:59.074
- Cold.
- I know.

01:00.284 --> 01:01.243
Hang on.

01:03.704 --> 01:04.620
Cold!

01:04.872 --> 01:07.499
It just feels cold because
you're so hot.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.002
Susan, stay with me. Susan.

01:11.128 --> 01:12.171
Susan!

01:15.465 --> 01:17.259
Has she been disoriented?
Confused?

01:17.676 --> 01:20.512
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

01:24.641 --> 01:25.559
Are you cold?

01:28.937 --> 01:29.813
Okay, swing it.

01:30.981 --> 01:32.774
- Move it, people.
- Is room 2 clear?

01:33.066 --> 01:34.276
Yes, it's clear.

01:34.818 --> 01:36.028
Get her pressure.

01:36.361 --> 01:38.322
Let's give her O2. Ten liters.

01:38.864 --> 01:40.616
Tap her right away.

01:48.624 --> 01:50.042
How's her breathing?

02:13.065 --> 02:14.566
No pulse or rhythm.

02:15.901 --> 02:17.569
Are you God?

02:19.196 --> 02:20.364
No.

02:20.781 --> 02:22.157
My name is Seth.

02:22.658 --> 02:23.951
Where are we going?

02:24.243 --> 02:25.244
Home.

02:26.954 --> 02:28.288
Can Mommy come?

02:28.830 --> 02:29.998
No.

02:38.674 --> 02:40.676
She won't understand.

02:41.176 --> 02:42.344
She will...

02:42.845 --> 02:44.179
...someday.

02:52.145 --> 02:54.189
Can I ask you something?

02:54.648 --> 02:55.858
Yes.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.402
What did you like best?

02:59.862 --> 03:01.655
Pajamas.

03:27.764 --> 03:29.683
She definitely knew what she liked.

03:30.726 --> 03:33.937
- Pajamas?
- Flannel, with feet.

03:34.354 --> 03:35.647
Pajamas.

03:36.523 --> 03:38.942
Excellent choice. What else?

03:39.651 --> 03:42.112
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

03:42.362 --> 03:45.741
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

03:46.325 --> 03:49.328
...but it made her turn
and look at him in such a way...

03:50.913 --> 03:52.456
And they...?

03:52.915 --> 03:54.166
Yes.

03:55.501 --> 03:57.002
It was a good day.

03:57.586 --> 03:59.796
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

04:00.380 --> 04:01.340
Touch?

04:02.341 --> 04:03.342
No.

04:04.259 --> 04:05.427
Yes, you do.

04:07.971 --> 04:09.765
Occasionally. Yes.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.851
Touch.

04:31.119 --> 04:33.997
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

04:34.248 --> 04:36.959
Blue eyes.
He's never going to leave her.

04:37.209 --> 04:40.963
20 minutes. 20 minutes. Everything
in this damn city is 20 minutes.

04:41.213 --> 04:42.798
It's never 20 minutes.

05:04.653 --> 05:08.365
My ass on a stool all day.
She always gets the good chair.

05:10.075 --> 05:14.246
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.261
$ 20,000 at 21 percent.

05:29.511 --> 05:32.472
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

05:32.848 --> 05:33.891
Ah, shit!

05:34.141 --> 05:38.562
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

05:38.812 --> 05:40.772
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

05:55.913 --> 05:58.540
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.126
They all want wings.

06:01.543 --> 06:03.295
I never know what to say.

06:03.837 --> 06:05.172
Tell them the truth.

06:05.964 --> 06:07.466
Angels aren't human.

06:08.008 --> 06:09.551
We were never human.

06:10.302 --> 06:13.889
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

06:14.223 --> 06:15.807
Tell her the truth.

06:16.350 --> 06:17.809
I told her.

06:20.103 --> 06:21.396
How did she take it?

06:22.439 --> 06:26.568
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

06:52.594 --> 06:55.889
On the 101 through
downtown L.A., no delays...

06:57.307 --> 06:58.934
Shit! Jesus!

08:08.045 --> 08:09.171
What do we got?

08:09.546 --> 08:13.759
50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

08:14.468 --> 08:17.137
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

08:17.554 --> 08:18.889
He's hypertensive.

08:19.097 --> 08:20.432
This diagonal looks tight.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.726
Who cathed him?

08:23.352 --> 08:24.645
Rosenberg.

08:26.063 --> 08:28.273
- Be right in.
- The patient wants to meet you.

08:40.535 --> 08:42.746
He's pretty out of it.

08:45.374 --> 08:46.750
The doctor's here.

09:10.607 --> 09:12.609
We're just going to cool to 32 today.

09:14.570 --> 09:15.445
Sucker.

09:18.907 --> 09:19.950
Jimi.

09:36.216 --> 09:37.092
Vein.

09:51.815 --> 09:53.567
Kid started walking.

09:54.401 --> 09:56.528
Three unassisted steps.

09:57.112 --> 09:59.698
- Get it on video?
- I wasn't even there.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.368
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

10:07.581 --> 10:08.499
Retrograde on.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.922
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

10:15.255 --> 10:16.882
Down to half flow,
here's your volume.

10:17.132 --> 10:18.550
- Ready to come off?
- Ready.

10:18.884 --> 10:19.760
Let's come off.

10:20.135 --> 10:21.428
We're coming down.

10:21.678 --> 10:24.848
We're clamped and off bypass.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.082
Oh, shit.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.835
What are you missing?

10:53.085 --> 10:53.919
Sponge.

10:55.379 --> 10:56.421
Bummer.

11:02.553 --> 11:03.679
Got it!

11:09.768 --> 11:11.186
Thank you, everybody.

11:11.562 --> 11:13.355
Presbyterian's on line 2.

11:13.730 --> 11:15.107
His rhythm will be irritable.

11:18.902 --> 11:22.364
- She's getting good, huh?
- Yeah, she's getting that attitude too.

11:22.698 --> 11:24.366
Getting an attitude?

11:26.785 --> 11:28.161
Shit! V-tac!

11:28.537 --> 11:29.872
Christ! Paddles!

11:30.289 --> 11:32.124
Kill the music. Get her back.

11:32.374 --> 11:34.459
- Charge to 2.
- Charging 200.

11:36.003 --> 11:36.920
Dr. Rice.

11:43.844 --> 11:44.761
Clear!

11:45.762 --> 11:47.431
- No pressure.
- You give him lidocaine?

11:47.598 --> 11:48.432
100's gone in.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.017
Buzz him again at 300.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.021
- Still nothing.
- Start compression.

11:54.188 --> 11:55.147
Kill the alarm!

12:00.068 --> 12:01.653
Hold up. It's not working.

12:01.862 --> 12:04.323
Got to open him.
How long to go back on?

12:04.656 --> 12:06.033
lt'll take me 10 minutes.

12:06.408 --> 12:07.910
Come on! Nothing.

12:08.243 --> 12:09.161
Knife.

12:17.628 --> 12:19.755
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.381
Ready.

12:21.924 --> 12:22.841
Hit it.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.512
Go to 30.

12:27.387 --> 12:28.263
Hit it.

12:28.639 --> 12:29.848
No response.

12:30.599 --> 12:32.309
Tom, I got to get back on bypass here.

12:32.601 --> 12:34.311
Almost there.
Give me 7 more minutes.

12:34.645 --> 12:35.521
Come on.

12:38.482 --> 12:39.650
Don't do this.

12:41.693 --> 12:42.569
He's going.

12:43.278 --> 12:44.321
He's not going anywhere.

12:54.623 --> 12:56.458
Come on, don't do this!

12:59.169 --> 13:00.504
Damn it, come on!

13:02.631 --> 13:03.715
Tom!

13:05.467 --> 13:06.969
Come on!

13:29.950 --> 13:31.285
Mrs. Balford?

13:32.536 --> 13:33.787
Where's the doctor?

13:35.372 --> 13:37.499
- I'm the doctor.
- I'm sorry.

13:39.543 --> 13:40.836
I operated on your husband.

13:41.461 --> 13:42.754
How is he?

13:45.299 --> 13:46.341
He didn't survive.

13:49.887 --> 13:50.762
What?

13:53.307 --> 13:55.851
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

13:56.226 --> 13:59.354
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia
and we couldn't resuscitate him.

13:59.730 --> 14:03.358
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

14:07.029 --> 14:08.071
I'm sorry.

14:14.495 --> 14:16.121
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

14:16.705 --> 14:18.415
What did you say?

14:21.376 --> 14:22.628
What?

14:24.004 --> 14:25.255
Oh, my God!

14:55.077 --> 14:57.788
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.581
I'm sorry.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.419
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.797
A graft occlusion? What?

15:08.924 --> 15:11.468
It was textbook. It was textbook.

15:18.141 --> 15:19.643
I'm so sorry.

15:22.437 --> 15:24.189
The room got so big.
I was so small.

15:24.439 --> 15:26.483
How did I get so small?

15:27.401 --> 15:28.610
I should've gone back on.

15:28.986 --> 15:31.321
I should've massaged longer.

15:31.613 --> 15:34.700
I should've gone back on.
Massaged longer. I lost it.

15:37.119 --> 15:38.662
I lost it.

15:57.431 --> 15:59.516
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

16:00.976 --> 16:01.894
You're looking at me.

16:02.561 --> 16:06.732
No, not by me, and not
by the dying or the delirious.

16:07.482 --> 16:09.151
Have you ever been seen...

16:10.152 --> 16:11.862
...like you were a man?

16:13.030 --> 16:17.367
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

16:17.701 --> 16:19.578
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

16:20.662 --> 16:23.874
- But she was blind.
- But she knew I was there.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.003
That doctor in the operating room...

16:29.838 --> 16:31.715
...she looked right at me.

16:32.132 --> 16:34.676
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

16:34.968 --> 16:37.387
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

16:38.138 --> 16:39.598
And if I want her to?

16:41.016 --> 16:42.184
Why do you want her to?

16:44.144 --> 16:45.437
To help her.

16:46.355 --> 16:47.356
Open it!

16:47.648 --> 16:49.024
Open it now!

16:49.650 --> 16:50.901
Everybody down!

16:53.070 --> 16:54.780
Do it! Do it!

16:55.072 --> 16:56.865
Shit! Just give him the money.

16:57.199 --> 16:59.743
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

17:00.077 --> 17:01.912
I should have gone to Ralphs.

17:02.579 --> 17:04.957
- Do it!
- Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

17:06.375 --> 17:08.126
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

17:08.417 --> 17:09.962
I'll never see my grandkids again.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.257
What am I doing?

17:14.215 --> 17:15.925
Just be cool. Be cool.

17:20.806 --> 17:21.682
Be cool, man.

17:22.391 --> 17:23.559
Be cool.

17:28.689 --> 17:29.982
Holy shit!

17:32.401 --> 17:33.944
They don't need to see us.

17:53.297 --> 17:54.798
You're early.

18:27.915 --> 18:29.041
What's going on?

18:29.374 --> 18:31.084
Ferris was looking for you.

18:43.430 --> 18:44.932
Don't I have a mitral valve to do?

18:45.140 --> 18:46.767
They canceled it.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.393
Who canceled it?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.478
Sheffield.

18:49.937 --> 18:51.188
Why are you telling me?

18:51.522 --> 18:52.397
He was busy.

18:52.606 --> 18:53.941
He was chickenshit.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.109
- Maggie, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.945
You're sick.
You can't operate.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.864
They've rescheduled for Monday.
An elective valve, no big deal.

19:01.156 --> 19:04.451
It is unprofessional, and it
embarrasses me in front of my staff.

19:08.997 --> 19:10.791
I saw the chart on Balford.

19:12.292 --> 19:14.127
I'm on the committee.
It's on review.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.797
- It wasn't your fault.
- I know.

19:17.047 --> 19:18.423
Then what's the problem?

19:22.678 --> 19:23.971
I don't know.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.182
You put up a terrific fight.

19:30.352 --> 19:32.229
We fight for people's lives, right?

19:35.065 --> 19:37.568
Don't you ever wonder who
it is we're fighting with?

19:42.114 --> 19:43.740
So I'm crazy and chemically imbalanced.

19:43.991 --> 19:45.576
You're tired.

19:46.743 --> 19:48.245
You have moments.

19:50.205 --> 19:51.290
Why didn't you call me?

19:54.084 --> 19:56.086
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

19:56.336 --> 19:58.297
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

20:00.549 --> 20:01.717
You're good.

20:02.050 --> 20:03.302
You know it.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.888
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

20:07.639 --> 20:08.515
Doctor?

20:15.063 --> 20:16.148
I'll see you.

20:40.797 --> 20:44.301
"As I walk along the stony shore
of the pond in my shirtsleeves..."

20:44.593 --> 20:47.221
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea..."

20:47.513 --> 20:50.140
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

20:50.432 --> 20:52.267
...probably cannot be said.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.647
For all that we say is the far-off
remembering of the intuition..."

20:57.105 --> 21:00.692
"...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once..."

21:05.989 --> 21:07.449
"Commencing search."
Searching my soul.

21:07.783 --> 21:10.619
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

21:10.994 --> 21:13.121
She's been looking
at me for half an hour.

21:13.413 --> 21:14.790
Maybe if I just hang here...

21:15.165 --> 21:19.127
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense..."

21:19.503 --> 21:23.048
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

21:24.842 --> 21:27.344
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man..."

21:29.221 --> 21:31.974
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

21:32.266 --> 21:36.687
...as you knew the river
would flow again after it was frozen.

21:37.062 --> 21:40.691
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

21:41.066 --> 21:45.571
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason."

22:21.607 --> 22:24.443
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

22:24.735 --> 22:25.861
What happened yesterday?

22:26.236 --> 22:27.821
They had a golf tournament.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.573
Who knows with these people?

22:29.865 --> 22:31.033
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

22:31.408 --> 22:33.911
The "G" is soft, like "messenger."

22:36.497 --> 22:37.623
What's on your lip?

22:38.040 --> 22:40.375
What? Am I slobbering here?

22:45.547 --> 22:48.133
- Where did you get that?
- What am I, a prisoner?

22:48.425 --> 22:51.220
You want to get well, or
you want Ben & Jerry's?

22:51.595 --> 22:53.013
This operation is a big deal.

22:53.764 --> 22:55.182
Continue to eat like this...

22:56.141 --> 22:58.435
...and you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

22:58.685 --> 23:02.773
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

23:03.106 --> 23:06.485
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

23:07.236 --> 23:09.696
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

23:10.072 --> 23:14.284
I ain't "the procedure." My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

24:39.077 --> 24:41.538
Hello, hello, hello...

24:44.249 --> 24:47.044
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

24:49.630 --> 24:52.674
Do you know the Muffin Man,
the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

25:38.428 --> 25:39.263
Hi, Anne.

25:39.513 --> 25:40.973
What are you doing here?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.267
I was on my way up to x-ray...

25:43.559 --> 25:45.727
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

25:46.895 --> 25:47.896
...hide.

25:48.856 --> 25:49.940
From what?

25:52.150 --> 25:53.694
I should've gone into pediatrics.

25:54.069 --> 25:54.987
Oh, no.

25:55.362 --> 25:57.990
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.160
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.998
Poor little guy.

26:10.377 --> 26:12.212
He never stops crying.

26:12.462 --> 26:14.673
- What's wrong with him?
- No insurance.

26:16.383 --> 26:19.303
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

26:19.761 --> 26:21.555
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

26:21.805 --> 26:24.766
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

26:25.976 --> 26:27.102
May I?

26:40.115 --> 26:41.408
Did you do an ultrasound?

26:41.658 --> 26:43.494
- You hear a murmur?
- Worth a shot.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.538
Okay, baby.

26:49.750 --> 26:52.503
So what are you hiding from?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.340
My patient's wife.

26:57.341 --> 27:00.344
She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

27:00.677 --> 27:03.305
...and that I have every confidence...

27:04.139 --> 27:05.307
...and I don't.

27:05.682 --> 27:08.644
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

27:08.894 --> 27:11.313
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

27:12.814 --> 27:15.359
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

27:16.652 --> 27:17.986
And if it isn't...

27:18.237 --> 27:19.863
...what do I do with that?

28:19.173 --> 28:20.465
Excuse me.

28:28.432 --> 28:29.892
Are you a visitor?

28:31.602 --> 28:32.603
Yes.

28:33.770 --> 28:36.440
Visiting hours have been
over since 8:00.

28:37.191 --> 28:38.942
Why do they have that?

28:39.484 --> 28:40.360
What?

28:40.569 --> 28:41.737
Hours.

28:42.905 --> 28:45.407
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

28:47.826 --> 28:49.745
Who are you visiting?
Mr. Messinger?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.205
Right now?

28:55.459 --> 28:56.418
You.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.049
I don't need a visitor.

29:02.299 --> 29:03.467
You're not ill?

29:03.717 --> 29:04.676
No.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.722
I'm one of the doctors here.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.060
Are you in despair?

29:17.689 --> 29:19.525
I lost a patient.

29:20.317 --> 29:22.236
You did everything you could?

29:23.654 --> 29:26.323
I was holding his heart
in my hand when he died.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.159
Then he wasn't alone.

29:29.576 --> 29:30.786
Yes, he was.

29:31.078 --> 29:32.162
People die.

29:32.412 --> 29:33.497
Not on my table.

29:33.747 --> 29:36.250
People die when their bodies give out.

29:36.542 --> 29:40.045
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

29:40.295 --> 29:42.172
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

29:42.464 --> 29:43.966
I wanted him to live.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.634
He is living.

29:46.218 --> 29:48.220
Just not the way you think.

29:56.311 --> 29:57.938
I don't believe in that.

29:58.188 --> 30:01.316
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

30:03.026 --> 30:04.611
How did you know my name?

30:08.907 --> 30:10.200
What's yours?

30:12.202 --> 30:13.412
Seth.

30:21.879 --> 30:23.672
You better get out of here, Seth...

30:23.922 --> 30:26.633
...or security's going to think
you're a psych patient.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.208
- Where are we?
- Down a liter.

31:42.876 --> 31:43.669
Suction.

31:44.628 --> 31:49.758
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

31:55.681 --> 32:00.227
No dying now, Mr. Messinger. Not until
you give me Seth 's phone number.

32:01.645 --> 32:06.400
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

32:34.136 --> 32:35.804
Those eyes.

32:36.513 --> 32:38.515
The way he looked...

32:39.016 --> 32:41.101
...right down into me.

32:43.145 --> 32:44.479
Seth.

32:45.939 --> 32:48.275
What kind of name is Seth?

34:50.022 --> 34:51.481
I thought you'd be here.

34:52.815 --> 34:53.942
Salty.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.904
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

34:58.447 --> 34:59.698
You okay?

35:06.663 --> 35:08.540
You might want to return this.

35:12.669 --> 35:16.423
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring."

35:17.216 --> 35:18.967
How did you know that...?

35:19.259 --> 35:21.386
What? I didn't give you this book.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.517
You didn't?

35:27.059 --> 35:28.268
Where'd you get it?

35:40.239 --> 35:43.492
Hi. I'm a physician, and I think
a patient left that in my office.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.745
- Can you tell me who checked it out?
- I can't tell you who.

35:46.995 --> 35:48.956
I can tell you when.

35:50.499 --> 35:52.125
All right, give me 5 minutes.

36:24.032 --> 36:25.492
Hello, Maggie.

36:27.911 --> 36:29.705
It's nice to see you again.

36:30.122 --> 36:31.832
It's weird to see you again.

36:32.541 --> 36:33.917
Weird is nice.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.922
You like Hemingway?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.259
Yeah, I'm starting to.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.057
May I?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.897
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

36:55.272 --> 36:57.399
...and their faint metallic taste...

36:57.941 --> 37:00.277
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

37:00.527 --> 37:03.405
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

37:03.739 --> 37:05.574
...I lost the empty feeling...

37:05.949 --> 37:07.910
...and began to be happy."

37:08.744 --> 37:11.246
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

37:12.748 --> 37:14.082
I like that.

37:16.752 --> 37:18.712
Do you come here a lot?

37:19.379 --> 37:20.672
I live here.

37:22.216 --> 37:23.717
What do you do?

37:24.009 --> 37:24.968
Read.

37:25.219 --> 37:27.513
No, I mean, your work.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.224
I'm a messenger.

37:32.392 --> 37:34.478
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

37:34.937 --> 37:37.356
No, I'm a messenger of God.

37:39.483 --> 37:40.692
Got a message for me?

37:41.777 --> 37:43.278
I already gave it to you.

37:43.529 --> 37:47.574
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.995
You've definitely been beeped.

37:54.248 --> 37:56.375
- How is Messinger?
- He's good.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.502
The operation went really well.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.213
- It was a good day.
- It was.

38:01.463 --> 38:03.799
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

38:04.383 --> 38:07.135
- You're an excellent doctor.
- How do you know?

38:08.053 --> 38:09.179
I have a feeling.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.723
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

38:12.641 --> 38:13.725
Close your eyes.

38:16.645 --> 38:18.105
It's just for a moment.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.835
What am I doing?

38:42.045 --> 38:44.298
You're touching me.

38:45.299 --> 38:46.717
Touch.

38:48.302 --> 38:49.595
How do you know?

38:51.138 --> 38:52.806
Because I feel it.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.233
You should trust that.

39:03.984 --> 39:05.777
You don't trust it enough.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.667
- Let's go somewhere.
- Where?

39:21.210 --> 39:22.169
I don't care.

39:23.378 --> 39:24.671
What do you want to do?

39:25.464 --> 39:27.007
Anything.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.137
What's that like?

40:16.932 --> 40:18.600
What's it taste like?

40:19.059 --> 40:20.727
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

40:22.938 --> 40:24.940
Well, it tastes like...

40:25.941 --> 40:27.192
...a pear.

40:27.943 --> 40:30.112
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

40:30.821 --> 40:33.448
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.081
Sweet...

40:41.456 --> 40:42.791
...juicy.

40:44.376 --> 40:47.254
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

40:47.629 --> 40:50.507
...like sugary sand that
dissolves in your mouth.

40:54.303 --> 40:55.596
How's that?

40:58.849 --> 41:00.309
It's perfect.

41:17.743 --> 41:22.289
The first time I looked in a microscope,
I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.586
Okay, let me have your hand.

41:28.212 --> 41:29.379
What for?

41:29.671 --> 41:31.423
We'll take a look at your blood.

41:32.466 --> 41:34.218
Not a possibility.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.764
Men.

41:39.014 --> 41:41.350
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

41:41.600 --> 41:43.519
...is 9 times higher than a man's.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.073
Take a look at that.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.870
That's bright.

42:07.042 --> 42:08.377
That's me.

42:09.378 --> 42:10.629
All those cells.

42:12.047 --> 42:13.799
That's all you are.

42:16.051 --> 42:18.387
That and all the space in between.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.723
If this is all you are...

42:21.974 --> 42:23.725
...these cells...

42:24.643 --> 42:26.895
...then when they die, that's the end.

42:28.188 --> 42:29.982
I don't know. I think so.

42:31.984 --> 42:33.735
How do you explain it?

42:33.986 --> 42:34.987
What?

42:36.697 --> 42:38.866
The enduring myth of Heaven.

42:43.954 --> 42:46.331
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

42:46.582 --> 42:47.708
But you didn't?

42:48.125 --> 42:49.209
No.

42:54.631 --> 42:58.594
Because something happened
in my O.R. and I got...

42:59.094 --> 43:02.598
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

43:03.056 --> 43:06.602
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it...

43:08.228 --> 43:09.938
Does that sound crazy?

43:10.689 --> 43:11.773
No.

43:13.150 --> 43:15.861
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

43:16.111 --> 43:17.863
...and I couldn't fix him.

43:19.031 --> 43:20.824
That's not supposed to happen.

43:23.577 --> 43:24.995
And I...

43:25.537 --> 43:26.914
You cried.

43:30.167 --> 43:31.251
Yeah.

43:33.378 --> 43:36.465
- Why do people cry?
- What do you mean?

43:37.174 --> 43:39.676
I mean, what happens physically?

43:43.472 --> 43:47.059
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

43:47.309 --> 43:50.604
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

43:50.854 --> 43:52.856
Why? Why do they overact?

43:55.651 --> 43:57.027
I don't know.

43:59.780 --> 44:01.782
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

44:02.032 --> 44:03.909
...your body just can't contain it.

44:04.159 --> 44:07.830
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.832
Your body weeps.

44:16.046 --> 44:17.130
I have to go.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.424
I got to go. Stay right here.

44:19.967 --> 44:21.260
Don't go anywhere.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.262
Stay right there.

44:44.324 --> 44:45.784
- Get the tube out.
- He can't breathe.

44:46.076 --> 44:47.911
It's because the tube is blocked.

45:00.048 --> 45:01.466
How you feeling?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.677
Ready to hit the waves.

45:03.927 --> 45:06.555
I'm afraid your bodysurfing
days are over.

45:09.141 --> 45:13.187
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

45:14.396 --> 45:16.231
That is my wife.

45:25.324 --> 45:27.576
Check his vitals every 15.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.553
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

45:54.436 --> 45:56.563
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

45:58.232 --> 45:59.691
Not yet.

46:28.679 --> 46:30.097
Where have you been?

46:30.681 --> 46:33.141
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

46:33.475 --> 46:34.768
Dinner?

46:35.227 --> 46:36.395
With who?

46:40.315 --> 46:43.193
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

46:43.443 --> 46:45.028
Did you pack my backpack?

46:45.904 --> 46:47.239
What else?

46:48.532 --> 46:49.783
We talked...

46:50.033 --> 46:52.202
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

46:52.452 --> 46:53.745
Why did you pack my backpack?

46:54.246 --> 46:55.956
Earl, what are you doing?

46:56.206 --> 46:58.876
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

46:59.168 --> 47:00.460
...maybe do a little hiking.

47:02.087 --> 47:03.088
What?

47:06.008 --> 47:07.885
God. Is it...?

47:08.218 --> 47:09.428
Maggie, it's just a tick.

47:09.928 --> 47:12.806
- Get a match.
- We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

47:13.056 --> 47:14.975
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

47:15.225 --> 47:18.353
- We can't just be burning tick heads.
- Then get some alcohol.

47:18.604 --> 47:19.479
I don't have any.

47:19.730 --> 47:21.982
- You don't have any alcohol?
- I don't operate here.

47:22.232 --> 47:23.734
How about some olive oil?

47:26.487 --> 47:28.071
Which kind? Jalapeño or rosemary?

47:28.947 --> 47:30.365
Rosemary.

47:31.617 --> 47:35.287
So what did you and your friend...
What did you say his name was?

47:37.039 --> 47:38.040
Seth.

47:38.290 --> 47:40.167
What did you two talk about?

47:41.877 --> 47:43.086
Dying.

47:45.547 --> 47:49.218
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

47:49.551 --> 47:52.513
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

48:01.188 --> 48:02.523
Can we talk for a minute?

48:02.773 --> 48:04.107
We'll talk while camping.

48:04.358 --> 48:06.735
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.695
We need some time together.

48:09.780 --> 48:12.491
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

48:12.741 --> 48:15.953
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

48:16.829 --> 48:17.746
Doing what?

48:18.205 --> 48:19.998
Just being here.

48:21.416 --> 48:23.126
I'll get the trail map.

48:23.669 --> 48:24.753
No, I mean it.

48:25.254 --> 48:26.547
Nothing but us.

48:30.008 --> 48:31.301
What do I do?

48:32.761 --> 48:34.137
Just look at me.

48:46.275 --> 48:47.359
You can't do it.

48:49.319 --> 48:50.988
You can't do it.

48:51.238 --> 48:53.866
- You flinched. You lose!
- You cheat.

49:08.338 --> 49:11.466
That old black magic called...

49:11.717 --> 49:13.468
...love.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.679
Thank you very much.

49:15.929 --> 49:19.600
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

49:21.894 --> 49:23.562
You want to watch anything?

49:27.274 --> 49:28.650
Me neither.

49:37.117 --> 49:39.036
How do you know when I'm here?

49:44.750 --> 49:46.043
I know.

49:48.253 --> 49:49.838
Jeez, you look good.

49:51.006 --> 49:54.384
I forgot how good everybody looked.

49:57.012 --> 49:59.097
30 years of silence.

49:59.348 --> 50:03.101
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

50:03.352 --> 50:04.686
It'll make it easier.

50:06.104 --> 50:08.398
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

50:08.649 --> 50:10.234
You might want to check your orders...

50:10.484 --> 50:12.528
...because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

50:12.778 --> 50:13.987
You're not dying.

50:14.238 --> 50:17.741
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

50:17.991 --> 50:20.285
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

50:21.787 --> 50:23.288
Unless...

50:26.792 --> 50:28.460
Could it be...

50:29.545 --> 50:30.754
...the doctor?

50:32.381 --> 50:33.757
Sure.

50:34.007 --> 50:35.551
The doctor.

50:36.343 --> 50:38.136
She's pretty.

50:38.387 --> 50:39.972
A little flat-chested...

50:40.222 --> 50:41.974
...but all you need's a handful.

50:42.266 --> 50:44.351
- Who are you?
- This is good.

50:44.810 --> 50:46.937
This is what they call...

50:47.187 --> 50:49.356
..."serendipitous."

50:49.606 --> 50:52.985
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

50:53.277 --> 50:54.486
Thank you.

51:01.493 --> 51:03.245
You ready to deal?

51:03.745 --> 51:06.540
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

51:16.508 --> 51:17.593
How's the French toast?

51:18.343 --> 51:19.303
Fabulous.

51:19.553 --> 51:20.679
Set me up.

51:29.271 --> 51:31.273
Guess I should introduce myself.

51:32.024 --> 51:33.525
Come on, give me your hand.

51:35.319 --> 51:37.613
Put it in mine. There you go.

51:37.905 --> 51:39.907
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

51:40.157 --> 51:41.575
No, that's too much.

51:41.909 --> 51:44.077
There you go. Good grip.

51:45.162 --> 51:46.580
Nathaniel Messinger.

51:46.830 --> 51:48.624
Glutton, hedonist...

51:48.874 --> 51:53.212
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

51:57.090 --> 51:58.759
I don't believe you.

51:59.009 --> 52:00.302
You want proof?

52:00.802 --> 52:02.638
You hang out at a library.

52:02.888 --> 52:04.556
You can speak every language.

52:04.890 --> 52:06.850
You travel with the speed of thought...

52:07.100 --> 52:09.019
...and you're reading
my mind right now.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.437
Stop that.

52:10.813 --> 52:11.939
You're doing it.

52:13.690 --> 52:14.817
It's impossible.

52:15.192 --> 52:18.320
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not."

52:20.864 --> 52:22.032
How?

52:22.741 --> 52:24.034
- You choose.
- Choose?

52:24.284 --> 52:25.911
To fall to Earth.

52:26.161 --> 52:29.122
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

52:29.373 --> 52:31.416
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

52:31.667 --> 52:34.503
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

52:37.714 --> 52:40.801
You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

52:41.051 --> 52:42.803
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

52:43.053 --> 52:46.598
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

52:46.849 --> 52:50.853
...so it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

52:53.564 --> 52:54.898
Human.

52:56.817 --> 52:57.985
Listen, kid:

52:59.444 --> 53:02.531
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

53:02.781 --> 53:04.908
You think He didn't give it to us too?

53:05.242 --> 53:06.118
Which gift?

53:06.827 --> 53:08.453
Free will, brother.

53:09.663 --> 53:11.206
Free will.

53:38.817 --> 53:40.402
Couldn't get a job.

53:40.944 --> 53:42.821
No past, no training.

53:43.071 --> 53:44.573
No I.D.

53:45.115 --> 53:48.744
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

53:48.994 --> 53:50.412
A skyscraper.

53:50.662 --> 53:53.290
And I thought, "I could do that."

53:53.540 --> 53:55.459
You see, these people down here...

53:55.709 --> 53:58.754
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

53:59.004 --> 54:02.216
That makes me uniquely qualified.

54:02.799 --> 54:06.553
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

54:06.803 --> 54:08.096
And I like what I do.

54:08.388 --> 54:09.515
I'm good at it.

54:12.142 --> 54:14.353
These things'll kill you.

54:16.146 --> 54:17.439
Are there others?

54:18.190 --> 54:19.775
Others like you?

54:20.150 --> 54:21.652
Yeah, they're out there.

54:22.110 --> 54:26.031
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

54:26.448 --> 54:30.160
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

54:30.828 --> 54:32.412
Then why'd you do it?

54:41.880 --> 54:43.507
My daughter, Ruth...

54:43.757 --> 54:45.592
...her stupid husband, Frank...

54:46.218 --> 54:47.678
...and my grandkids.

54:47.928 --> 54:50.347
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

54:53.767 --> 54:56.353
And this is my wife, Teresa.

54:59.690 --> 55:01.024
Did you...

55:01.984 --> 55:03.610
...tell her who you were?

55:04.653 --> 55:07.239
I started to try once or twice.

55:07.656 --> 55:09.575
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

55:09.825 --> 55:11.118
Do what?

55:11.702 --> 55:13.495
It's too much for them.

55:14.788 --> 55:17.166
People don't believe in us anymore.

55:26.717 --> 55:28.969
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

55:29.553 --> 55:31.430
And sunset, yes.

55:32.764 --> 55:34.266
Take me there?

55:45.694 --> 55:47.321
Can you hear it?

55:58.165 --> 55:59.208
No.

56:18.185 --> 56:19.770
I can't hear that!

56:20.020 --> 56:22.397
But you can't feel this!

56:22.898 --> 56:24.233
Nathan!

56:31.406 --> 56:32.699
You have to go back.

56:32.950 --> 56:35.077
Not until I catch the big wave.

56:39.414 --> 56:40.582
Wait.

56:41.250 --> 56:42.376
Wait.

56:42.626 --> 56:44.086
Wait for what?

56:45.254 --> 56:46.380
Swim!

57:22.166 --> 57:24.168
And then you just...

57:24.626 --> 57:25.752
...fall.

57:26.336 --> 57:27.880
- Fall?
- Dive.

57:28.922 --> 57:30.966
You make up your mind to do it...

57:31.967 --> 57:33.468
...and you do it.

57:33.969 --> 57:36.263
And when you wake up, you're...?

57:36.930 --> 57:38.307
Yes.

57:40.601 --> 57:42.478
To smell the air.

57:43.020 --> 57:44.438
Taste water.

57:44.688 --> 57:45.772
Read a newspaper.

57:46.023 --> 57:46.773
To lie.

57:47.065 --> 57:48.525
Through your teeth.

57:49.193 --> 57:50.152
To feed the dog.

57:53.113 --> 57:54.448
Touch her hair.

57:56.992 --> 57:58.535
What are you waiting for?

58:04.124 --> 58:06.668
There is so much beauty up here.

58:08.504 --> 58:09.796
Yes.

58:34.905 --> 58:36.114
Here you are again.

58:37.699 --> 58:39.535
We'll release your friend
Messinger tomorrow.

58:39.827 --> 58:40.994
That's good.

58:41.245 --> 58:44.623
His family's having a kind
of a welcome-home party.

58:47.751 --> 58:49.211
Will you be going?

58:49.753 --> 58:51.213
Will you be going?

58:54.049 --> 58:55.008
This is Earl.

58:55.300 --> 58:56.593
He told me.

58:57.719 --> 58:58.929
What else does he tell you?

58:59.179 --> 59:03.141
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

59:03.892 --> 59:06.937
Sometimes I think Earl's the
only one who understands me.

59:07.187 --> 59:08.272
What about your boyfriend?

59:08.856 --> 59:10.190
Do you love him?

59:13.193 --> 59:14.528
Love? I don't know.

59:14.778 --> 59:16.113
What does that mean?

59:17.030 --> 59:19.116
I was hoping you could tell me.

59:20.075 --> 59:22.202
It's a word...

59:22.452 --> 59:25.122
...that describes a chemical react...

59:26.707 --> 59:29.376
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

59:31.295 --> 59:34.673
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

59:34.923 --> 59:36.466
...and I don't even know you.

59:37.092 --> 59:38.760
What do you want to know?

59:40.762 --> 59:42.514
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time.

59:42.764 --> 59:45.017
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

59:46.101 --> 59:47.269
Are you married?

59:47.978 --> 59:49.021
No.

59:49.897 --> 59:50.898
Are you homeless?

59:52.483 --> 59:53.567
No.

59:54.693 --> 59:55.861
Are you a drummer?

01:00:00.782 --> 01:00:02.784
Why don't you ever touch me?

01:00:06.747 --> 01:00:08.457
I don't want to hurt you.

01:00:10.959 --> 01:00:12.461
You won't hurt me.

01:00:37.486 --> 01:00:38.862
Did you feel that?

01:00:52.334 --> 01:00:54.670
If I could make you understand...

01:00:57.881 --> 01:00:59.383
I understand.

01:01:04.179 --> 01:01:05.806
I'll see you around.

01:02:10.746 --> 01:02:11.955
Hey, Doc!

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.461
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

01:02:18.378 --> 01:02:19.880
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.465
You look great.

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.218
Is this heaven?

01:02:24.635 --> 01:02:25.886
Look at this.

01:02:30.474 --> 01:02:32.267
Come on, let's meet some people.

01:02:32.684 --> 01:02:34.144
You got an appetite?

01:02:38.732 --> 01:02:40.150
Have a beer, Seth.

01:02:40.984 --> 01:02:41.985
Where you from?

01:02:43.403 --> 01:02:44.196
Up.

01:02:44.446 --> 01:02:46.615
North. Uh, Canada.

01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:55.332
Listen. Can you hear?

01:02:56.291 --> 01:02:57.751
I'm growing.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.378
Smile, Hannah.

01:03:09.137 --> 01:03:10.514
How long have you known Seth?

01:03:12.516 --> 01:03:13.809
Not very long.

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.604
But I feel like I've known him forever.

01:03:18.689 --> 01:03:20.691
Honey, that hurts.

01:03:22.818 --> 01:03:24.528
You're just like Grandpa.

01:03:26.613 --> 01:03:27.781
Come on.

01:03:28.448 --> 01:03:29.783
Let's see if the cookies are done.

01:03:30.284 --> 01:03:31.326
Come on, Seth.

01:03:31.577 --> 01:03:33.787
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, great.

01:03:39.168 --> 01:03:40.460
How did you two meet?

01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:44.965
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

01:03:45.924 --> 01:03:47.176
I thought he was a messenger.

01:03:48.343 --> 01:03:50.387
Yeah, he's one of those...

01:03:50.637 --> 01:03:51.597
..."hyphenates."

01:03:52.514 --> 01:03:53.849
I'll be right back.

01:04:33.597 --> 01:04:35.182
Here, can you cut this up?

01:04:43.065 --> 01:04:45.567
So in what province in Canada
were you born?

01:04:46.568 --> 01:04:48.362
I wasn't born in Canada.

01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:54.284
What are your parents' names?

01:05:02.835 --> 01:05:04.169
No parents.

01:05:11.552 --> 01:05:14.429
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

01:05:14.763 --> 01:05:16.181
I'm not a construction worker.

01:05:16.473 --> 01:05:18.684
Very pale hands. Let me see.

01:05:22.646 --> 01:05:25.023
- Why did you do that?
- Let me see your hand.

01:05:25.315 --> 01:05:26.191
No.

01:05:28.318 --> 01:05:29.319
What's your last name?

01:05:29.611 --> 01:05:30.737
You know my last name.

01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:32.197
I don't.

01:05:34.491 --> 01:05:35.534
Plate.

01:05:36.368 --> 01:05:37.411
Seth Plate?

01:05:44.168 --> 01:05:45.711
I cut you.

01:05:47.671 --> 01:05:49.047
I cut you.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.262
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

01:05:56.263 --> 01:05:57.598
Not the way you do.

01:05:59.183 --> 01:06:00.726
The way I do?
What does that mean?

01:06:01.018 --> 01:06:04.605
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

01:06:04.897 --> 01:06:06.231
The way...

01:06:07.524 --> 01:06:08.484
...a human does.

01:06:11.028 --> 01:06:12.446
I have no sense of touch.

01:06:13.864 --> 01:06:14.656
You feel that?

01:06:15.199 --> 01:06:16.658
Don't be frightened.

01:06:17.034 --> 01:06:18.202
You freak!

01:06:18.494 --> 01:06:19.620
You liar!

01:06:20.204 --> 01:06:21.955
Who... What are you?

01:06:22.372 --> 01:06:23.874
I came to take Mr. Balford...

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.793
...and I saw you.

01:06:28.837 --> 01:06:31.089
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

01:06:31.924 --> 01:06:33.759
How you fought for him.

01:06:35.844 --> 01:06:37.763
And you looked right at me...

01:06:38.388 --> 01:06:40.098
...like I was a man.

01:06:40.682 --> 01:06:43.560
- "To take Mr. Balford"?
- I was there.

01:06:43.852 --> 01:06:47.773
- We're always there in every room.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:48.273 --> 01:06:49.775
I was there in the stairwell...

01:06:50.692 --> 01:06:52.736
...when you cried for your patient.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:55.447
And I touched you. Remember?

01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:59.117
Why are you doing this?

01:07:00.536 --> 01:07:02.246
Because I'm in love with you.

01:07:10.295 --> 01:07:11.839
I don't believe you.

01:07:12.798 --> 01:07:14.216
Do you feel that?

01:07:17.094 --> 01:07:18.554
You don't want to believe me.

01:07:19.221 --> 01:07:21.181
I cannot conceive of it!

01:07:23.225 --> 01:07:24.643
Just get out!

01:07:25.769 --> 01:07:27.146
Get out!

01:08:17.362 --> 01:08:18.404
Doctor?

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:22.533
Doctor?

01:09:09.497 --> 01:09:10.624
Hello?

01:09:17.673 --> 01:09:18.715
Seth?

01:09:22.426 --> 01:09:23.679
Are you here?

01:10:20.569 --> 01:10:22.362
I want to see you.

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.700
Let me see you.

01:10:56.396 --> 01:10:57.856
Just stay.

01:11:00.776 --> 01:11:02.986
Just stay until I fall asleep.

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:41.942
Oh, yes!

01:11:44.862 --> 01:11:46.196
Thank you.

01:12:07.759 --> 01:12:09.553
The baby can't sleep.

01:12:10.387 --> 01:12:12.014
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

01:12:12.389 --> 01:12:14.683
I don't know. Let's check him out.

01:12:24.359 --> 01:12:25.527
Choanal atresia.

01:12:25.777 --> 01:12:28.113
There's hardly any air getting through.

01:12:28.864 --> 01:12:29.781
How did you know?

01:12:31.867 --> 01:12:33.285
I just...

01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:36.079
...knew!

01:13:02.064 --> 01:13:03.106
Maggie?

01:13:03.774 --> 01:13:04.775
Yeah.

01:13:05.067 --> 01:13:06.193
Are you alone?

01:13:07.069 --> 01:13:08.070
Yeah.

01:13:12.157 --> 01:13:14.535
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

01:13:14.952 --> 01:13:16.161
Think so?

01:13:17.621 --> 01:13:18.747
I couldn't have done it better.

01:13:20.207 --> 01:13:21.708
Well, that's a compliment.

01:13:36.765 --> 01:13:38.308
What are you doing?

01:13:38.642 --> 01:13:40.102
I'm spending time with you.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.398
Will you marry me?

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:47.317
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:49.111
Get married on the Nevada side...

01:13:49.444 --> 01:13:51.488
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.243
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:58.162
What do you want me to say?

01:13:59.163 --> 01:14:00.831
We belong together.

01:14:01.415 --> 01:14:03.083
We're the same species.

01:14:09.673 --> 01:14:13.135
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.512
...the proverbial heart.

01:14:18.807 --> 01:14:20.309
Please be my wife.

01:14:24.855 --> 01:14:26.023
Just think about it.

01:14:41.747 --> 01:14:42.915
Breathe in.

01:14:46.877 --> 01:14:47.961
Breathe in.

01:15:01.517 --> 01:15:02.601
I'm good.

01:15:10.526 --> 01:15:15.197
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

01:15:18.826 --> 01:15:19.868
He didn't tell you.

01:15:24.122 --> 01:15:25.082
Tell me what?

01:15:25.749 --> 01:15:27.042
Maybe you should ask him.

01:15:27.793 --> 01:15:29.503
No, I'm asking you.

01:15:41.014 --> 01:15:42.766
Seth knows no fear...

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.351
...no pain...

01:15:44.643 --> 01:15:46.186
...no hunger.

01:15:47.354 --> 01:15:49.731
He hears music in the sunrise.

01:15:52.067 --> 01:15:53.861
But he'd give it all up.

01:15:54.153 --> 01:15:55.654
He loves you that much.

01:15:58.407 --> 01:16:00.117
I don't understand.

01:16:03.203 --> 01:16:04.705
He can fall.

01:16:05.372 --> 01:16:08.041
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

01:16:08.333 --> 01:16:11.378
He can give up eternity and become...

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:12.838
...one of us.

01:16:13.672 --> 01:16:15.007
It's up to you.

01:16:16.967 --> 01:16:18.552
How do you know this?

01:16:24.475 --> 01:16:26.059
Because I did it.

01:17:03.597 --> 01:17:05.516
Seth, I need to talk to you.

01:17:09.978 --> 01:17:11.897
Seth, please.

01:17:14.983 --> 01:17:16.026
Please be here.

01:17:18.403 --> 01:17:20.322
God, help me through this.

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:33.335
You are so beautiful.

01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:37.840
You'll always be that way.

01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:43.262
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

01:17:43.554 --> 01:17:44.930
...and get married.

01:17:47.808 --> 01:17:49.226
He knows me.

01:17:50.602 --> 01:17:52.604
He knows the demands of my work.

01:17:53.188 --> 01:17:54.940
You don't love him.

01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:57.734
He and I are the same.

01:18:00.362 --> 01:18:01.780
And I want that.

01:18:05.534 --> 01:18:09.371
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

01:18:11.123 --> 01:18:12.749
But you can feel me.

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:14.710
You felt me.

01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:18.172
I want to say goodbye.

01:18:20.465 --> 01:18:22.217
I don't want to see you again.

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:25.127
Hey, buddy.

01:22:26.128 --> 01:22:27.588
You can't be in here.

01:22:28.463 --> 01:22:29.464
Do you see me?

01:22:31.383 --> 01:22:32.926
Do you see me?

01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:34.761
Can you see me?

01:22:35.095 --> 01:22:36.221
We can see you.

01:22:38.182 --> 01:22:39.600
Is this blood?

01:22:39.892 --> 01:22:40.767
This is blood!

01:22:41.185 --> 01:22:42.352
Is it red?

01:22:42.895 --> 01:22:43.812
Red?

01:22:44.271 --> 01:22:45.481
Is it red?

01:22:46.899 --> 01:22:48.358
Color.

01:22:48.692 --> 01:22:50.736
What color were the drugs you took?

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:53.405
Better get your butt out of here.

01:22:54.323 --> 01:22:55.449
You got somewhere to go?

01:22:59.411 --> 01:23:00.621
Maggie.

01:23:12.841 --> 01:23:15.677
Down and down and down I go

01:23:15.969 --> 01:23:18.180
Round and round and round I go

01:23:18.931 --> 01:23:20.557
Round and spin

01:23:20.849 --> 01:23:22.976
Loving the spin I'm in

01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:25.813
Loving that old black magic...

01:23:26.104 --> 01:23:28.065
...called love

01:23:29.566 --> 01:23:31.443
Love!

01:23:32.778 --> 01:23:33.946
Hi!

01:23:43.914 --> 01:23:47.251
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

01:24:31.378 --> 01:24:32.546
Can I help you, sir?

01:24:32.796 --> 01:24:35.591
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

01:24:36.633 --> 01:24:37.468
Breath!

01:24:40.971 --> 01:24:42.014
Maggie Rice.

01:24:43.765 --> 01:24:44.933
Are you a patient?

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:46.935
No. I just need to find her, please.

01:24:47.352 --> 01:24:49.688
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

01:24:50.355 --> 01:24:51.565
Do you know where she is?

01:24:52.357 --> 01:24:54.276
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

01:24:57.654 --> 01:24:59.281
You have this computer...

01:25:00.657 --> 01:25:02.701
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:07.789
Where's Maggie?

01:25:13.170 --> 01:25:14.838
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

01:25:17.007 --> 01:25:18.258
What happened to you?

01:25:18.592 --> 01:25:19.551
Sorry.

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:21.136
It's okay.

01:25:24.264 --> 01:25:25.474
I fell.

01:25:25.974 --> 01:25:28.644
Evidently. Off a train?

01:25:29.603 --> 01:25:31.188
I fell in love.

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:40.155
Please help me find her.

01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:48.705
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

01:25:49.039 --> 01:25:50.040
Wait!

01:26:21.655 --> 01:26:22.865
Cassiel.

01:26:23.824 --> 01:26:25.033
Are you there?

01:26:34.042 --> 01:26:34.960
Hello.

01:27:30.182 --> 01:27:31.433
Where you headed?

01:27:33.143 --> 01:27:34.019
Tahoe!

01:27:35.437 --> 01:27:36.647
Reno!

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.065
Tahoe!

01:27:38.732 --> 01:27:40.067
I'm going to Reno.

01:27:40.442 --> 01:27:41.860
I'm going to Tahoe.

01:27:42.402 --> 01:27:44.822
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

01:30:02.084 --> 01:30:03.627
Am I too late?

01:30:05.379 --> 01:30:06.380
Too late?

01:30:07.297 --> 01:30:08.423
Jordan?

01:30:12.845 --> 01:30:14.596
I couldn't marry Jordan.

01:30:17.933 --> 01:30:19.601
I'm in love with you.

01:30:27.776 --> 01:30:29.111
What happened?

01:30:32.573 --> 01:30:33.949
Free will.

01:30:49.131 --> 01:30:50.632
I feel you.

01:32:09.711 --> 01:32:11.171
Do you feel that?

01:32:11.547 --> 01:32:12.631
Yes.

01:32:14.633 --> 01:32:15.926
And that?

01:32:20.013 --> 01:32:22.808
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

01:32:23.851 --> 01:32:25.185
I can't.

01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:28.188
Try.

01:32:30.065 --> 01:32:31.233
Warm.

01:32:36.697 --> 01:32:37.990
Aching.

01:32:56.133 --> 01:32:57.384
It's okay.

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.388
We fit together.

01:33:01.763 --> 01:33:02.764
I know.

01:33:03.557 --> 01:33:05.601
We were made to fit together.

01:33:27.164 --> 01:33:30.167
I always asked the dying what
they liked best about living.

01:33:32.878 --> 01:33:34.630
Wrote it down in my book.

01:33:37.174 --> 01:33:38.342
This is it.

01:33:39.968 --> 01:33:41.678
This is what I like best.

01:33:42.679 --> 01:33:44.807
You haven't even started yet.

01:33:45.599 --> 01:33:48.018
We have our whole lives together.

01:33:48.352 --> 01:33:49.561
You and me.

01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:51.772
Mr. and Mrs. Plate.

01:39:28.317 --> 01:39:30.277
- I'll get help.
- You're here.

01:39:30.986 --> 01:39:32.488
- Stay.
- I should get help.

01:39:32.738 --> 01:39:34.781
Don't go. The driver went.

01:39:35.032 --> 01:39:36.325
Please stay.

01:39:36.658 --> 01:39:38.535
Please stay with me.

01:39:39.328 --> 01:39:40.787
I'm scared.

01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:47.002
I screwed up.

01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.297
I wanted to show you everything.

01:39:50.756 --> 01:39:51.965
You will.

01:39:55.636 --> 01:39:58.347
You came all this way.

01:39:59.723 --> 01:40:01.225
I'm sorry.

01:40:02.309 --> 01:40:04.269
God, no, Maggie!

01:40:05.354 --> 01:40:06.688
To touch you...

01:40:06.939 --> 01:40:08.148
...and to feel you.

01:40:09.066 --> 01:40:12.069
To be able to hold your hand right now.

01:40:12.486 --> 01:40:13.654
You know what that means?

01:40:13.904 --> 01:40:16.573
Do you know how much I love you?

01:40:21.119 --> 01:40:23.205
Keep looking at me, okay?

01:40:24.832 --> 01:40:26.583
Look right in my eyes.

01:40:28.544 --> 01:40:30.254
Someone's out there.

01:40:32.256 --> 01:40:35.676
Don't look at them.
Please don't you look at them!

01:40:35.926 --> 01:40:37.469
Is this what happens?

01:40:44.601 --> 01:40:45.602
Yes.

01:40:52.109 --> 01:40:53.819
This is what happens.

01:40:58.282 --> 01:41:00.075
I'm not afraid.

01:41:04.163 --> 01:41:05.831
When they ask me...

01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:09.293
...what I liked the best...

01:41:11.628 --> 01:41:12.796
...I'll tell them...

01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:14.590
...it was you.

01:41:44.745 --> 01:41:45.829
God!

01:43:49.411 --> 01:43:51.914
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

01:43:54.458 --> 01:43:55.626
I'm sorry.

01:43:59.421 --> 01:44:00.631
Get out.

01:44:03.258 --> 01:44:05.844
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

01:44:06.428 --> 01:44:07.346
No.

01:44:08.597 --> 01:44:09.807
Why did He do this?

01:44:10.098 --> 01:44:11.099
I don't know.

01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:12.518
Because her number was up?

01:44:13.727 --> 01:44:15.354
What do you want me to say?

01:44:23.111 --> 01:44:26.281
- Am I being punished?
- You know better than that.

01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:29.576
That's life.

01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:32.538
You're living now.

01:44:34.456 --> 01:44:35.457
And one day...

01:44:36.125 --> 01:44:37.459
...you'll be dying.

01:44:44.258 --> 01:44:45.300
What's it like?

01:44:46.635 --> 01:44:47.553
What?

01:44:48.679 --> 01:44:49.680
Warmth.

01:44:51.974 --> 01:44:53.350
It's wonderful.

01:44:55.477 --> 01:44:57.646
If you'd known this
was going to happen...

01:44:59.356 --> 01:45:00.649
...would you have done it?

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.740
I would rather have had...

01:45:10.492 --> 01:45:12.369
...one breath of her hair...

01:45:16.123 --> 01:45:17.916
...one kiss of her mouth...

01:45:21.003 --> 01:45:23.046
...one touch of her hand...

01:45:25.257 --> 01:45:27.426
...than an eternity without it.

01:45:30.512 --> 01:45:31.555
One.
