WEBVTT

01:26.045 --> 01:28.130
Okay.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.383
-Okay.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.182
Anything?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.809
Give us a chance, babe.

01:41.644 --> 01:42.645
Are you telling me

01:42.728 --> 01:44.021
all that incredible sex
was for nothing?

01:47.817 --> 01:49.109
Have you put the rice on?

01:49.693 --> 01:52.321
-Yes, chef.
-Yeah, not too much.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.281
Oh, fuck!

01:55.699 --> 01:59.245
Hmm. Well, we know
it's not your eggs.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.290
It's my boys. They just...
need a bit of get-up-and-go.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.293
We can try the frozen peas
on my bollocks again.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.504
The most humiliating night
of my life.

02:08.587 --> 02:11.131
I remember that.
Was that even a thing?

02:11.215 --> 02:13.884
God knows. Anyway, who needs kids?

02:13.968 --> 02:15.094
Can't go to the pub,

02:15.177 --> 02:18.013
can't go on holiday.
You can't get stoned.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.016
And our sex life will be
me wanking six nights a week.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.520
Twice on Sundays.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.649
Hey, little baby, don't you cry

02:28.732 --> 02:31.151
Mamma's gonna buy you a...

02:31.235 --> 02:34.947
House in a gentrified part of London

02:35.030 --> 02:37.658
It's all right to be
a little bit wobbly, babe.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.119
-Hmm?
-I'm not wobbly.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.871
-Yeah, you are.
-No, I'm not.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.747
I know you, you are.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.129
It's always been you and me
versus the rest of the world.

02:51.422 --> 02:54.049
And soon it might be you...

02:54.758 --> 02:56.510
and me...

02:56.594 --> 02:59.388
and it
versus the rest of the world.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.265
Oh, God,
they don't stand a chance.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.725
-No, they don't.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.612
The moment of truth.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.364
Okay.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.760
No?

03:39.762 --> 03:40.846
Yeah.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.016
-No.

03:45.643 --> 03:48.520
-Holy shit! Yes!

03:48.604 --> 03:50.356
Careful, careful, careful!
I'm pregnant!

03:50.439 --> 03:52.775
-Oh, my God. Call your mum.
-I said it out loud.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.693
-I'm... I'm pregnant.
-We need to get champagne.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.153
I know, I...
I can't drink any more.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.696
Well,
alcohol-free fizzy, then.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.199
Oh, my God,
you are fucking amazing!

04:00.282 --> 04:01.325
-Mwah!

04:01.408 --> 04:04.244
-You're amazing!
-Oh, my God, okay. Um...

04:04.328 --> 04:05.496
Either way, this means
one of my boys

04:05.579 --> 04:07.373
got through. I am a man!

04:07.456 --> 04:09.124
Okay, I need to go
and do it again.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.334
I need to go and call my mum.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.211
I'm gonna go and do it again.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.713
-We're having a baby.
-I'm pregnant.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.174
-I love you.
-I love you.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.219
Oh, my God.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.222
Oh, fuck.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.865
Excuse me. Mate.

04:42.700 --> 04:43.742
Yeah, you.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.494
Sorry for calling you
a wanker yesterday.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.329
-That's all right...
-Got any blow?

04:47.413 --> 04:49.415
Uh, no. No, I don't...

04:49.498 --> 04:52.543
Mate, what's wrong?
I can't ask a question?

04:55.129 --> 04:59.258
Fucking anti-social, man.
Am I right?

05:10.227 --> 05:13.605
Excuse me, mate.
What's that, champagne?

05:13.689 --> 05:15.607
What, you rich, mate?

05:15.691 --> 05:18.777
Excuse me! Mate!

05:18.861 --> 05:20.362
Yo!

05:20.446 --> 05:22.906
What, are you
the Secret Millionaire?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.658
You gonna answer me or what,
wanker?

05:24.742 --> 05:27.036
It's not champagne,
it's fucking prosecco. Okay?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.495
Non-alcoholic.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.790
My girlfriend's pregnant,
so go fuck yourself. Okay?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.468
-Honey, I'm home!

05:42.551 --> 05:44.011
Got the bubbly-wubbly.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.846
Good, babe.
Because I'm definitely,

05:45.929 --> 05:46.930
definitely pregnant.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.099
Have you called your mum?
She's gonna go mental.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.684
Oh, shit. Yeah, no,
I need to call her now.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.227
-Go fuck myself?

05:52.311 --> 05:54.104
-No, no, no, no!
-Babe?

05:56.231 --> 05:58.067
-Oh, my God.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.945
No, please. Please, stop!

06:05.949 --> 06:07.618
Hi, uh, is that the police?

06:07.701 --> 06:08.786
Uh, yeah, I need someone

06:08.869 --> 06:10.245
to come, um,
right now, please.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.872
-Um, there's...

06:11.955 --> 06:16.543
There's a break-in. Yeah,
it's, um, 115 Duncombe Road...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.881
-Help! Help!

06:20.964 --> 06:22.841
Help!

06:22.925 --> 06:25.469
-No, please, she's pregnant!

06:33.310 --> 06:34.812
Whoo!

06:35.938 --> 06:38.982
Get away! Get away from me!

06:42.736 --> 06:44.071
Whoo!

06:45.364 --> 06:48.826
Is that right?
You up the spout?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.417
Well, go on, then. Do it!

07:00.796 --> 07:04.842
Let's find out if you're
really nice... or nasty.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.976
That's it, girl.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.774
Shit, feds!
Fam, come on! Come on!

07:23.110 --> 07:26.155
Nice girl, then. Shame, that.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.168
Jamie...

09:53.010 --> 09:56.388
My God. It's so green.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.056
Slight change from the estate.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.350
Yeah. Just a bit.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.728
Look, I don't
want to be the fun police,

10:02.811 --> 10:04.521
but you have to stop smiling
all the time.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.940
I can't help it.
It's just... gorgeous.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.109
Your Aunt Maeve
has just died, remember?

10:09.192 --> 10:10.736
I... I know. I know.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.905
But she's left us a house
with a huge garden.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.157
Yeah, I get it, babe,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.701
but have a little dignity
in your grief.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.662
Ah. Just happy. And... and sad.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.635
There's milk in the fridge,

11:16.718 --> 11:19.221
and I made sure you had
a full canister of gas.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.640
God forbid you should start
your new life in a house

11:21.723 --> 11:23.934
where you can't boil a kettle
for a cup of tea.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.310
We have an actual septic tank.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.312
We are proper
country bumpkins.

11:27.396 --> 11:31.191
He's so easily pleased.
Um, what about the roof?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.609
Oh, no. I can sort that.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.362
You can't change a light bulb
without getting vertigo, babe.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.655
We'll get a professional.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.573
-I'll email you some names.
-Great, thank you.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.367
Thanks, Niamh,
you've been amazing.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.119
-Oh, no bother, sure.
-Seriously.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.498
Maeve wanted to keep the place
in your family, Jamie.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.418
And she'd have loved you,
Maya.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.253
Did you know her well?

11:51.336 --> 11:56.049
As well as anyone could,
which is to say... not very.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.302
She was a funny one, Maeve.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.225
There is one more thing
I need to show you,

12:05.308 --> 12:07.310
and it's a little bit...

12:09.062 --> 12:10.730
little bit peculiar.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.903
Yeah, I came on holiday
here loads as a kid.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.363
It was good times.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.991
I remember you.
All freckles and elbows,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.994
running round like a cat
with its tail on fire,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.705
chasing bees and butterflies.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.332
Aunt Maeve was always
giving me sweets.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.543
Club chocolate bars.
Do you remember them?

12:32.461 --> 12:35.422
I think she used to spoil me
because she never had kids.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.133
Oh, yeah.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.178
I remember this.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.431
Aunt Maeve would never let me
go in there.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.600
Can we go through there?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.560
Do we... do we own the wood
as well?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.355
Maeve believed
in the old ways.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.400
Every evening, before sunset,

12:55.484 --> 12:57.569
she'd leave
a blood offering here.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.279
Sorry, did you say blood?

13:00.071 --> 13:02.908
Well, not like
the Aztec fellas

13:02.991 --> 13:06.286
ripping their hearts
out of their chests. No, no.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.625
She'd leave a little slice
of liver or some such.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.586
For who?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.340
-The Little People.
-Leprechauns?

13:18.423 --> 13:20.884
Brilliant. Oh, I love it.
It's so Irish.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.887
Not leprechauns, exactly.

13:25.138 --> 13:29.309
Some call them the Far Darrig,
or the Redcaps.

13:29.392 --> 13:33.104
So she thought that
these leprechauns, um...

13:33.188 --> 13:35.273
sorry, Little People,
lived in that wood?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.443
Maeve's was a life of sorrow.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.489
She did have a child,
but one she...

13:43.990 --> 13:45.909
Oh, no, please, tell us.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.038
Her husband, a young man,

13:50.121 --> 13:52.499
funny fella,
like yourself, Jamie...

13:53.291 --> 13:54.793
he passed first.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.836
Pneumonia.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.130
Then the child.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.217
-Maeve blamed herself.
-Why?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.178
Maeve told me
it was punishment

14:05.262 --> 14:07.472
for turning her back
on the old ways.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.726
Well, she fell in love,
had a family...

14:12.727 --> 14:15.814
and she forgot to respect
the Little People.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.150
Poor woman,
losing her baby like that.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.195
Seriously, I had no idea.
Mum... Mum never said a thing.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.615
Maeve truly believed that what
she was doing was important.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.242
And if it's all right
with you,

14:27.325 --> 14:29.244
I'd like to continue
the tradition.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.620
An offering. Every day.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.039
You mean you would be coming
into our garden every day?

14:33.123 --> 14:34.541
I'm not sure we're...

14:34.624 --> 14:36.626
No, um, I can do it.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.254
Every day?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.256
We've been gifted
this beautiful house,

14:41.339 --> 14:45.051
and if doing this is
the only price we have to pay,

14:45.135 --> 14:46.636
then we're very,
very happy to do it.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.597
-It's no problem. No.
-I promise.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.559
Bless you both.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.607
Come to Fennessy's tonight.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.817
-First drink is on the house.
-Thanks, Niamh.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.652
-We will. Thank you.
-We will.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.154
It's very sweet. Bye-bye.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.781
Did you pack any raw liver?

15:06.865 --> 15:10.744
You know, that's the one thing
I forgot to pack. Damn it.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.121
Shit. Shit!

15:13.204 --> 15:14.539
I had a list and everything.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.750
-It was, uh, milk, tea bags...
-Blood.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.002
Bloody raw liver
for the... what is it,

15:19.085 --> 15:21.296
Redcap-offering-ritual thing?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.089
What was I thinking?

15:24.215 --> 15:26.384
This is our house.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.179
We live here.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.930
Can you believe it?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.853
Hmm?

15:37.520 --> 15:39.898
I never thought
that we'd get out.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.108
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

15:42.192 --> 15:44.486
That's in the past.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.154
All right? I am never going

15:46.237 --> 15:47.822
to let that happen
to you again.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.575
We're safe here.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.244
I promise. Okay?

15:54.245 --> 15:57.165
Just you,
me and the little one.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.044
-Mm.
-Mm-hmm.

16:03.672 --> 16:06.549
Echoes of the pain

16:06.633 --> 16:11.471
That you have hung upon the staves

16:11.554 --> 16:15.475
-Let it flow
-Let it flow

16:15.558 --> 16:20.105
-Let it flow
-Let it flow

16:20.188 --> 16:22.357
I hear the wind

16:22.440 --> 16:27.779
Rattling my window pane

16:27.862 --> 16:31.908
-Let it blow
-Let it blow

16:31.991 --> 16:35.328
-Let it blow
-Let it blow

16:35.412 --> 16:39.416
Parallel lines

16:39.416 --> 16:41.960
Parallel lines

16:42.043 --> 16:46.673
Running through time

16:51.261 --> 16:56.057
Parallel lines

16:57.892 --> 17:03.064
They will never entwine

17:09.487 --> 17:14.909
Birds gunshot scatter from your eyes...

17:15.076 --> 17:17.829
-Hey! Hey, shoo!

17:17.912 --> 17:19.497
Shoo! Go on.

17:19.581 --> 17:20.915
-Shoo!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.227
Look what I found.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.395
Oh, yeah.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.690
This used to be
on the mantelpiece.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.443
Yeah,
Maeve would cross herself

17:48.526 --> 17:50.737
every time she looked at it.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.572
Do you think that's her child?

17:56.367 --> 17:58.369
Oh, yeah. That.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.916
Yeah, I'll fix it tomorrow,
babe.

18:06.795 --> 18:10.256
Going. Yeah.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.885
-I need an Irish SIM.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.007
Hi.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.094
My husband emailed you
about getting some work done.

18:57.595 --> 19:01.224
Ah, okay. It could have gone
into your junk mail maybe.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.853
Niamh recommended you.
Does that help?

19:04.936 --> 19:07.021
Yeah, it's our roof.

19:08.523 --> 19:09.691
Yeah.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.485
Um...

19:12.569 --> 19:15.446
I mean,
as soon as possible, really.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.742
Yeah.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.873
Since when did you eat Marmite?

19:24.956 --> 19:27.041
Cravings, babe. Cravings.

19:28.334 --> 19:32.380
I mean...
could they start this week?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
She's actually laughing.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.679
Your Aunt Maeve
was some character,

19:39.762 --> 19:40.972
I can tell you.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.807
Healing hands, she had.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.019
Oh, she helped me with a touch
of the gout back in the day,

19:46.102 --> 19:48.605
and for that, well, Jesus...

19:48.688 --> 19:50.148
No, no, put that away.
Put that away.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.150
-Really?
-No, it's on the house.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.985
-It's my treat.
-Oh...

19:55.194 --> 19:58.031
-Mm. Mm...

19:58.114 --> 19:59.991
Oh, man, this is so good.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.245
-Everyone is so nice here.
-Yeah, they are.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.456
Hey, whoa! Check it out. Look.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.880
General builders. Brilliant.

20:13.963 --> 20:16.132
This wasn't on Niamh's list,
though, babe.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.508
Darling, this is Ireland.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.011
It rains
365 days of the year

20:20.094 --> 20:22.096
every year,
not just leap years.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.724
The weather hasn't been
that bad, has it?

20:24.807 --> 20:27.435
Not yet. It's sunny now,
but trust me.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.491
Roofing and kitchens. Result!

20:41.574 --> 20:43.284
-Hello?
-Babe, we should at least...

20:43.368 --> 20:45.495
-Fuck me!

20:45.578 --> 20:47.163
Jesus Christ!

20:47.246 --> 20:50.583
-Thanks for that!

20:50.667 --> 20:52.543
-It's all right. It's okay.
-Fuck!

20:53.670 --> 20:56.422


21:09.143 --> 21:11.813
-Shh, shh.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.272
Hi.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.002
-Sláinte!
-Sláinte!

21:34.085 --> 21:36.587
-Oh! Ah.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.716
-There you are, son.
-Oh!

21:39.799 --> 21:40.925
You'll taste the difference
straight away.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.052
It's not like that muck
they give you over in London.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.013
-Good luck to you both now.
-Thank you.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.015
Baby clothes. Like this.
A whole sack.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.224
I won't take no for an answer.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.559
That's actually... Thank you!

21:49.642 --> 21:51.227
-They're so nice. Thank you.
-Great!

21:51.310 --> 21:54.147
They're lovely. Aw!

21:55.106 --> 21:58.526
-Hi.
-Oh, bejaysus.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.738
-Cheers.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.365
Sláinte.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.618
-I'm Seamus.
-Nice to meet you, Seamus.

22:10.329 --> 22:14.584
Maeve's house must be
a right auld shambles.

22:15.460 --> 22:20.673
She never had much time
for your modern innovations.

22:20.757 --> 22:24.135
Jaysus, she didn't even
get the electricity

22:24.218 --> 22:26.054
till after the millennium.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.264
Yeah, it's a fixer-upper.
Yeah, mate.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.808
Big feckin' hole in the roof.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.311
Oh, we've noticed.
That's our priority.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.855
But trying to find a builder
round here...

22:35.938 --> 22:37.356
that isn't booked up
is impossible.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.901
Ah. They're all busy lads,
huh?

22:39.984 --> 22:41.277
No. Actually, we've been lucky.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.780
We managed to find someone
to start straight away.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.364
What's his name, um...?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.075
-Col...?
-Colm Whelan.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.868
The Whelans!

22:50.578 --> 22:52.121
That shower of cowboys.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.499
Is there a problem?

22:54.582 --> 22:57.668
Ah, don't take
any notice of them.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.088
The Whelans are fine.

23:00.171 --> 23:04.258
They might get a little
raucous at the weekends,

23:04.342 --> 23:06.052
but they'll do a good job.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.762
Daddy Whelan keeps them

23:07.845 --> 23:09.931
under control, sure enough.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.307
You'll be grand.

23:13.142 --> 23:17.980
Just don't leave your missus
alone with the lads.

23:18.689 --> 23:22.235
They'll be playing on her baps
like kids on a bouncy castle.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.361
Wow!

23:23.444 --> 23:24.445
Rory, would you ever
shut your hole?

23:24.570 --> 23:25.655
-It's... it's not cool, man.
-Wow. No.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.616
I don't mean nothing by it.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.618
I do think you're beautiful...

23:30.701 --> 23:32.912
-Now, that's it now. Home.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.206
Go home and sober up,
you old fool.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.833
You're an old witch.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.252
Away and wash
the back of your bollocks!

23:40.628 --> 23:43.506
Go home and you can
apologize when you're sober!

23:43.589 --> 23:45.007
Ah! Me bollocks!

23:45.091 --> 23:47.093
And take your dog with you!

23:47.176 --> 23:49.053
Fuck you! Come on! Ah! Ah!

23:49.137 --> 23:52.682
Go on! Youse can take your...

23:52.765 --> 23:56.727
So... what did you
leave out tonight?

23:58.312 --> 24:01.357
-Sorry?
-For the Redcaps?

24:01.440 --> 24:04.193
-Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.
-Did we do it?

24:04.277 --> 24:05.278
I completely forgot.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.113
Maya, you promised.
You said...

24:07.196 --> 24:08.906
I know. I'll do it
as soon as I get home.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.158
Cross my heart,
pinkie promise.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.242
Uh, what was it?

24:11.325 --> 24:13.035
It was raw liver and...
Was that it?

24:13.119 --> 24:14.662
-Yeah.
-Right.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.542
Can I have a... a word?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.630
-Fucking hell.
-You're in trouble.

24:24.714 --> 24:27.383
-Really? This is really fun.
-Go on. Go and get told off.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.759
What'll you have, Father?

24:28.843 --> 24:30.303
Guinness, please, a half.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.096
-Let me do this.
-Do what now?

24:32.180 --> 24:34.473
You won't even know I'm there.
First thing in the morning...

24:34.557 --> 24:35.641
So you want to
wander in and out

24:35.725 --> 24:37.101
of our garden, willy-nilly?

24:37.185 --> 24:39.729
It's our house,
it's our garden. No.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.022
I made a promise to Maeve.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.565
And I get that, but I can't...

24:42.648 --> 24:45.193
-What harm will I do?
-No, Niamh!

24:51.782 --> 24:53.201
Look, back in...

24:54.035 --> 24:55.203
back in London...

24:57.997 --> 25:02.251
we had three guys break into
our flat and try to kill us.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.297
What? I'm so sorry. I...

25:08.216 --> 25:09.592
I had no idea.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.510
That...
that must have been awful.

25:11.594 --> 25:16.224
Yeah, it was. And I can't
be scared in my own house.

25:16.307 --> 25:19.310
Not any more. Not again.
And not with this child.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.983
When you said
you'd forgotten...

25:26.067 --> 25:28.069
I broke a promise,
and I know that.

25:28.778 --> 25:32.073
It's important, Maya.
You have to do this.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.786
God, you really do believe,
don't you?

25:41.582 --> 25:43.292
I saw one once.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.629
In the wood
at the bottom of your garden,

25:46.712 --> 25:49.090
sure as I'm standing here.
Plain as day.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.469
But what happened
to not perpetuating

25:53.552 --> 25:55.972
stereotypes of leprechauns
and all that?

25:57.139 --> 25:58.391
The Far Darrig...

25:59.558 --> 26:02.311
are not jolly little elves,
Maya.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.482
They'll be hungry.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.610
And they'll need feeding,
every day.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.908
Okay.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.203
Okay. Every day.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.039
Promise.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.586
Thank you.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.091
-Molly!

26:32.174 --> 26:34.010
Molly, come back here now!

26:34.093 --> 26:37.847
You silly dog, ya! Ahh!

26:37.930 --> 26:43.686
'Twas a box of the finest old oak, sir

26:43.769 --> 26:48.941
'Twas a foot long and four inches wide

26:49.025 --> 26:53.571
Says I to myself, "Fuck the fairies," ha!

26:53.654 --> 26:59.118
And I took a quick look inside

26:59.201 --> 27:04.040
Now I opened the lid of this box, sir

27:04.123 --> 27:09.170
And I swear that my story is true

27:09.253 --> 27:14.342
'Twas an ancient old Irish French letter

27:14.425 --> 27:18.429
A relic of Brian Boru...

27:18.512 --> 27:19.847
Come on! Come on, Molly!

27:21.223 --> 27:23.017
Go on up the yard now.

27:24.435 --> 27:30.608
'Twas an ancient
old Irish French letter

27:30.691 --> 27:35.571
'Twas a foot long and made of elk hide

27:35.654 --> 27:37.573
Molly!

27:37.656 --> 27:41.243
-Molly! Come back here now!

27:41.327 --> 27:42.536
Who's there?

27:43.954 --> 27:47.875
Away home now.
Stop wasting my time.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.420
You feckin' Jackeens!
I'll kick your arse for youse!

27:53.172 --> 27:56.008
It's past your bedtime, little one.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.597
-What are you now?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.265
-Boo!

28:18.114 --> 28:20.908
Wake up! Babe, wake up!

28:30.042 --> 28:32.128
Shh, quiet. You'll wake them up.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.256
Oh, for fuck's sake!

28:37.842 --> 28:39.051
Move your arses.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.887
I want this kitchen done
before I die of old age.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.014
Yeah, well,
if he's not movin' them,

28:44.098 --> 28:45.641
what am I supposed to do?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.018
Careful, you big gobshite!

28:50.938 --> 28:52.022
Hello?

28:53.357 --> 28:55.609
Oh. Jamie, Maya.

28:55.693 --> 28:57.486
Lovely to see you again.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.697
Mr Whelan,
we weren't expecting you.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.073
Daddy Whelan.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.992
Everyone calls me Daddy.
Hmm?

29:04.368 --> 29:06.745
Job fell through,
so we, uh, thought

29:06.829 --> 29:08.247
no time like the present, huh?

29:08.330 --> 29:10.875
Look, you don't mind us at all.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.085
You just carry on with your
day as if we weren't here.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.545
Okay, um, it's just
we would have preferred

29:14.628 --> 29:15.713
if you'd called ahead

29:15.796 --> 29:17.548
because you all scared
the shit out of us.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.176
No, you, maybe.
I mean, I was fine.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.512
Actually... actually,
I wasn't. I was terrified.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.849
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr Whelan?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.059
Daddy. Call me Daddy.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.438
-Three sugars, plenty of milk.
-Sorry.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.190
So, you're gonna be starting

29:34.273 --> 29:36.775
on the kitchen first,
not the roof?

29:36.859 --> 29:38.986
I mean, we would actually
rather the roof was done...

29:39.069 --> 29:42.156
Well, the scaffold won't be
here till tomorrow, so, uh...

29:42.239 --> 29:44.408
we thought why not make
the use of our time

29:44.492 --> 29:46.118
and start on your kitchen?

29:46.994 --> 29:48.787
Eoin, help your sister
with that, will you,

29:48.871 --> 29:50.206
before she drops it.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.291
I'll dock it
from both your wages.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.502
You brothers and sisters,
are you?

29:54.585 --> 29:56.879
Eoin's our brother
from another mother.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.006
She was a big auld
fuckin' lump, too.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.674
-Killian!

30:03.052 --> 30:04.887
So, you're starting

30:04.970 --> 30:06.597
a family business yourself,
huh?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.432
-Yes.
-When is it due?

30:08.516 --> 30:11.101
Thanks, darling.
Um, any day now.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.270
-Really soon.
-Boy or a girl?

30:13.354 --> 30:15.981
Oh, well,
we want it to be a surprise.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.027
Killian.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.447
Use the cutters, for Jaysus's
sake, not your teeth.

30:23.531 --> 30:26.325
Um, is it three sugars, Mr. Whelan?

30:26.408 --> 30:28.118
Yes, please, darlin'.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.538
Call me Daddy!

30:31.622 --> 30:34.208
Killian, get back to work.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.711
Did you see how the one
with the dodgy haircut

30:37.795 --> 30:38.837
was staring at you?

30:38.921 --> 30:41.799
Well, I saw the sister
giving you a little smile.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.552
And the dad,
making you call him "Daddy".

30:44.635 --> 30:46.053
If he does that again,
I'm gonna...

30:46.136 --> 30:47.721
Then you're gonna what?

30:47.805 --> 30:50.307
-Are you gonna start a fight?
-No.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.936
-But I can finish one.
-Ooh.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.606
With your big Irish cricket bat.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.233
-Just...

30:59.316 --> 31:01.569
Just don't call him "Daddy",
okay? It's weird.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.654
All right. We're not in Camden
any more, Toto.

31:03.737 --> 31:04.738
If we piss him off,

31:04.822 --> 31:06.615
we've still got a hole
in the roof, remember?

32:12.222 --> 32:13.974
There's been
a place of worship here

32:14.058 --> 32:15.768
since the time of the Druids.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.979
Even Cromwell and his men
couldn't extinguish our faith.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.900
Is this your first child?

32:27.321 --> 32:28.864
Sort of.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.449
Sort of?

32:33.535 --> 32:37.623
When I was very young,
before I met Jamie...

32:38.874 --> 32:40.959
I was with a guy,
I got pregnant,

32:41.043 --> 32:44.129
but he wasn't father material.

32:44.213 --> 32:45.881
I see.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.717
It was a difficult decision,
but I don't regret it.

32:50.803 --> 32:54.515
Our lives would have been bad.
Really, really bad.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.061
And... I want this so much.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.147
It's a fighter.

33:03.107 --> 33:07.361
Maya, I can't approve
of your actions, but...

33:07.444 --> 33:10.280
I sincerely hope
that you find peace here.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.242
Thank you.

33:14.785 --> 33:17.538
Well, Jamie, here we are.
Here's your Auntie Maeve.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.374
Next to your uncle
and the little one, of course.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.961
Well, uh,
I got you some flowers...

33:24.044 --> 33:25.796
to say thank you.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.381
We really appreciate you

33:27.464 --> 33:29.133
leaving us the house.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.093
More than you know.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.973
So are they just stacked up
like Lego under there or...

33:36.056 --> 33:37.641
-Jamie.
-I'm just curious.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.017
No, they're side by side.

33:39.101 --> 33:42.104
Of course,
the child is just a stone.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.399
-She was cremated?
-No. The body was never found.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.153
Uh, didn't she die
of pneumonia?

34:04.418 --> 34:06.420
Seriously,
I have never drunk so much tea

34:06.503 --> 34:08.297
in my entire life.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.090
I've got so much caffeine
in my system,

34:10.174 --> 34:12.634
I'm gonna be pissing pure
Barry's for days. I am.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.262
That's Niamh.
Pull over. Pull over, babe.

34:15.345 --> 34:16.555
Oh, yeah.

34:18.182 --> 34:20.517
If you see anything, stop,

34:20.601 --> 34:22.352
raise your hand and call out

34:22.436 --> 34:24.646
and one of the supervisors
will come to you.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.357
Hey, Niamh. Hi.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.818
Rory didn't go home
last night.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.862
No one's seen him
since he left the pub.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.655
Oh. He was pretty drunk,
wasn't he?

34:33.739 --> 34:34.948
You don't think he's...

34:35.032 --> 34:38.285
Oh, no. It's... it's Molly
I'm worried about.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.039
-His dog.
-Can we help?

34:42.122 --> 34:44.416
No, the lads have it covered.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.169
You go on
and have a cup of tea.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.713
Oh, tea, yay. Can't wait.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.215
I'll see you in a second.

34:52.508 --> 34:55.636
Um, we went to go
and see Maeve's grave today.

34:56.637 --> 34:59.515
Father Brendan told me
something interesting.

35:01.350 --> 35:04.520
The baby didn't die of
pneumonia, did she, Niamh?

35:07.856 --> 35:10.776
She made a bargain
with the Redcaps...

35:11.735 --> 35:14.321
to save her dying husband.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.326
But Maeve paid
a terrible price.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.161
What price?

35:22.079 --> 35:25.082
She said the Redcaps
took her baby.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.169
I mean...

35:30.295 --> 35:34.007
could it have been...
a post-natal depression thing?

35:34.091 --> 35:37.719
Because... some women
do hurt their children...

35:37.803 --> 35:40.305
Maeve loved that child
more than life itself!

35:40.389 --> 35:43.559
She wouldn't harm a hair
on her head! No!

35:46.603 --> 35:47.688
No.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.026
After the baby disappeared,

35:53.110 --> 35:56.822
she devoted her life
to leaving those offerings.

35:58.866 --> 36:01.743
Keeping the monsters
on the other side of the wall.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.380
So you're telling me

36:13.463 --> 36:14.506
that my lovely
Great Aunt Maeve,

36:14.590 --> 36:17.134
who used to give me chocolate
bars, was a baby killer?

36:17.217 --> 36:19.469
-Great.
-No, we can't judge.

36:19.553 --> 36:22.055
-People do crazy things.
-Yeah. Crazy.

36:22.139 --> 36:24.224
I was nearly abducted
when I was a little toddler

36:24.308 --> 36:25.767
outside my nursery,
and then my mum...

36:25.851 --> 36:28.687
Your mum punched the guy
unconscious. Yes, I know,

36:28.770 --> 36:31.690
because she tells me that
every time I fucking see her.

36:31.773 --> 36:34.067
All I'm saying is that women,
mothers,

36:34.151 --> 36:37.112
-are capable of crazy shit.
-Yeah.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.449
-Ow!
-Don't fuck with Mumma Bear.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.826
Yeah. Shit.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.746
-Aw. Did I hurt you?
-Fucking guns, you have.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.290
-No. Doesn't hurt.
-Did I hurt Pappa Bear?

36:48.373 --> 36:49.583
Doesn't hurt.
Pappa Bear is fine.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.336
-Oh, is Pappa Bear bruised?
-Pappa Bear's fine.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.763
Oh, for fuck's sake.

37:02.846 --> 37:03.847
Take a breath, babe.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.015
I'm really not in the mood
for a fight.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.976
Is that fucking weed?

37:11.939 --> 37:13.941
-Having a break?

37:14.024 --> 37:15.108
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:15.192 --> 37:17.319
You know, I would prefer it
if you didn't actually smoke

37:17.402 --> 37:19.279
your doobies on my doorstep.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.323
-I need a bath.
-Okay.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.953
-Where's your dad?
-He's seeing a customer.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.329
Can I get in my own house,
please?

37:27.412 --> 37:28.622
-Your house?
-Yeah.

37:28.705 --> 37:29.706
You own it, do you?

37:29.790 --> 37:30.916
All the way
to the core of the Earth?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.125
Well, the freehold, yeah.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.339
Ash, how many times

37:37.422 --> 37:38.423
have the English
come to this country

37:38.507 --> 37:41.093
and told us
what's ours is now theirs?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.177
Too many, Killy.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.262
Thing is, though,
don't we always take it back?

37:44.346 --> 37:46.390
Always. Henry VIII,
the Desmond Rebellions,

37:46.473 --> 37:47.933
the Nine Years' War.
You heard of them?

37:48.016 --> 37:49.226
Oliver Cromwell.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.728
Ah, fuck it, yeah. How could
I forget that arsehole?

37:51.812 --> 37:53.063
-Yeah.
-The famine.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.441
-Nah, two famines.
-Two fuckin' famines, yeah.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.068
Seems to me
that when the English

37:58.151 --> 38:01.363
like the look of something,
they either buy it cheap,

38:02.072 --> 38:03.824
or send an army in
to steal it.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.159
Would you like some ketchup

38:06.243 --> 38:08.578
with that massive chip
on your shoulder?

38:08.662 --> 38:11.790
I like your place, boss man.
It's nice.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.291
Maybe I should steal it.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.377
No court in the land
would convict you, brother.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.461
Yes, yes, they would.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.171
And don't give me this
"Irish Rover" crap.

38:18.255 --> 38:21.883
I'm not Oliver Cromwell.
I'm actually Irish.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.927
-You? Irish?

38:24.011 --> 38:25.178
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

38:25.262 --> 38:27.305
Yeah, on his ma's side.

38:27.389 --> 38:31.059
Da told me. His Auntie Maeve
used to own this place.

38:31.143 --> 38:32.352
Ah, yeah, yeah.

38:32.436 --> 38:33.562
That mad auld bitch

38:33.645 --> 38:34.813
-that killed her kid, is it?

38:34.896 --> 38:39.192
That's her. So that makes you
what, ugh... quarter Irish?

38:39.276 --> 38:40.819
Quarter Irish?

38:40.902 --> 38:42.404
Jaysus, it's like being
in the presence

38:42.487 --> 38:44.573
of Michael Collins himself.

38:57.753 --> 39:00.547
Oh, Jesus Christ!

39:26.448 --> 39:27.949
Please, she's pregnant!

39:37.959 --> 39:41.171
Jamie!

39:42.631 --> 39:43.840
Maya?

39:45.050 --> 39:48.136
-Maya!
-Maya! Maya!

39:48.220 --> 39:49.596
-Maya!
-Darling Maya.

39:50.347 --> 39:53.975
Ah, you know, Eoin's... simple.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.394
But he doesn't mean any harm.

39:56.478 --> 39:59.189
Yeah, I know. I was just
very scared, that's all.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.108
And what about the other two?
They seem to be...

40:01.191 --> 40:02.901
I'll have a word with them
tonight.

40:02.984 --> 40:06.363
But, you know, their mother
passed away not so long ago.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.657
-Oh, blimey, that's awful.
-Really sorry to hear that.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.742
She could keep them
on the straight and narrow.

40:10.826 --> 40:13.829
She just had to say a word.

40:13.912 --> 40:18.500
Me? Well, I prefer the more
direct approach.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.584
Yeah, all right, okay.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.212
I don't want you
hitting your kids and...

40:23.380 --> 40:27.092
Ah. Well,
they need to know their place.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.510
We all need to know our place.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.053
This is gonna sound
a little petty,

40:30.137 --> 40:32.305
but they actually ate
all my chocolate Hobnobs.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.390
I don't mind...

40:33.473 --> 40:34.683
I don't mind if they ask,
but...

40:34.766 --> 40:36.601
Well, far be it from me
to get between a man

40:36.685 --> 40:39.813
and his choccy biscuits.
Oh, Jesus!

40:39.896 --> 40:42.566
Oh, well, like I said,
I'll... I'll have a word.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.067
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

40:44.151 --> 40:46.319
Well, see you
bright and early.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.822
-See ya.
-Thank you, Mr. Whelan.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.491
Daddy!

40:53.118 --> 40:55.036
Why the fuck
does he keep on asking me

40:55.120 --> 40:56.288
to fucking call him "Daddy"?

40:56.371 --> 40:58.290
Just a fucking lunatic.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.458
No, it wasn't
just the Hobnobs.

41:00.542 --> 41:01.960
They ate
my fucking grapes, too.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.504
Yeah, and one of them
left something in the loo.

41:04.588 --> 41:05.672
What?

41:06.798 --> 41:08.884
You are fucking kidding me!

41:10.468 --> 41:12.179
Fuck's sake!

41:13.305 --> 41:14.806
Hey...

41:14.890 --> 41:18.435
Why don't you go and take that
out on the punch bag, babe?

41:18.518 --> 41:20.562
They're fucking useless.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.022
Useless bunch of...

42:03.230 --> 42:04.606
Fucking hell.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.801
-Eoin!
-Eoin!

43:14.884 --> 43:17.012
Eoin!

43:17.095 --> 43:19.389
-Eoin, you're bleedin' thick.
-What the fuck?

43:19.472 --> 43:21.057
Somebody
could have been killed!

43:21.141 --> 43:22.976
-What are...? No, wait, wait.

43:23.059 --> 43:24.060
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

43:24.144 --> 43:25.353
Stop fucking laughing!

43:25.437 --> 43:27.272
-Fuckin' chill out, man.
-No, no. This...

43:27.355 --> 43:28.356
This is your problem.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.066
You don't take anything
fucking seriously!

43:30.150 --> 43:31.735
Hey, hey. Calm down,
calm down. Shh. Calm down.

43:31.818 --> 43:33.069
It was a fuckin' mistake, man.

43:33.153 --> 43:34.237
It was just an accident,
right?

43:34.321 --> 43:36.531
No, no, no...
No, babe, they have to go.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.742
You have to go right now!

43:38.825 --> 43:40.910
No, I can't fucking take this
any more!

43:40.994 --> 43:43.079
Calm down, please. Listen,
it was an accident, wasn't it?

43:43.163 --> 43:46.374
That's what I've been saying.
But he keeps getting angry.

43:46.458 --> 43:47.584
Are you frustrated, Jamie?

43:47.667 --> 43:51.296
Do you know what? You are
unprofessional. You are lazy.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.423
And... and you are thieves!

43:53.506 --> 43:54.507
Baby, please.

43:54.591 --> 43:56.676
-Thieves, is it?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

43:56.760 --> 43:58.803
-Stop it! Stop it!
-You come into my house.

43:58.887 --> 44:02.932
You break my things,
you take my stuff, you...

44:03.016 --> 44:04.184
-Stop!

44:04.267 --> 44:05.852
-Back off.
-Fuckin' big man!

44:05.935 --> 44:08.313
Whoa-ho!
Fuckin' David Beckham.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.273
Please stop.
Will you just shut

44:10.357 --> 44:11.858
the fuck up right now,
please?

44:11.941 --> 44:14.486
Oh, darling, it's all right.
It's okay.

44:14.569 --> 44:15.737
I'm all right.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.989
You're all right.
We're all okay.

44:18.073 --> 44:20.700
Aren't we, yeah?
We're gonna fix it.

44:20.784 --> 44:23.495
It was just an accident, okay?
It was just an...

44:23.578 --> 44:25.538
-Hey, stop!

44:25.622 --> 44:26.998
-What the fuck are you doing?

44:27.123 --> 44:28.208
Hey, hey! Stop it!

44:28.291 --> 44:30.418
Stop fucking... Stop it!

44:30.502 --> 44:32.128
Daddy! Daddy, not in my home.

44:32.212 --> 44:34.255
Your home. My child.

44:34.339 --> 44:35.465
And I'll punish him
however I...

44:35.548 --> 44:38.134
-Stop! Stop it!

44:38.218 --> 44:39.677
Daddy, stop.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.097
Step away.

44:57.404 --> 44:59.531
-Who's the daddy now?
-I'm not talking to you.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.158
-What did I do?

45:33.606 --> 45:35.358
-Rory?

46:06.639 --> 46:07.765
Wow.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.493
Hello?

46:59.442 --> 47:00.735
Hello?

47:12.121 --> 47:13.748
Is anyone there?

47:21.798 --> 47:23.383
Oh, God.

47:24.634 --> 47:26.427
-Oh, hello.

47:28.221 --> 47:30.807
You're Rory's dog, Molly,
aren't you?

47:31.766 --> 47:34.269
Where is he, then? Huh?

47:35.478 --> 47:38.690
Is he drunk in a ditch
somewhere, the dirty bastard?

47:44.612 --> 47:45.905
All right.

47:46.906 --> 47:48.616
You want me to follow you?

47:49.617 --> 47:50.994
I'm coming.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.751
-Ah, you fuckin' eejit!

47:58.835 --> 48:01.004
Ey? Do you think
I was done with ya?

48:01.087 --> 48:03.006
-You fuckin' halfwit!

48:04.757 --> 48:06.509
Now get out of me sight!

48:07.802 --> 48:10.763
And if you're not back here
before we're done,

48:10.847 --> 48:12.640
you can fucking walk home!

48:21.024 --> 48:22.442
Molly, come on.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.736
Oh, shit.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.531
Molly, come on,
let's go home now.

48:34.329 --> 48:37.790
Molly, I can't whistle and I'm
carrying an eight-pound baby.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.378
Molly?

48:44.130 --> 48:46.549
Molly, there you are,
you silly mutt.

49:04.567 --> 49:06.611
Molly, what have you found?

49:06.694 --> 49:07.945
Huh?

49:33.346 --> 49:34.639
Rory?

49:39.143 --> 49:40.853
Rory, are you there?

49:49.737 --> 49:50.947
Molly?

49:54.283 --> 49:55.702
Hello.

49:56.828 --> 49:59.205
Oh, has something died
in here?

50:02.625 --> 50:04.627
What the fuck is this place?

50:04.711 --> 50:06.212
-Molly.

50:06.295 --> 50:08.339
-Molly, come on.

50:08.423 --> 50:10.341
Oh, you want me
to come down there with you?

50:10.425 --> 50:12.885
No fucking way.
Molly, come on.

50:12.969 --> 50:15.346
-Come on. Fine.

50:15.430 --> 50:18.641
You can stay here,
but I'm not coming down there.

50:18.725 --> 50:21.144
I'm going. I'm going.

50:23.980 --> 50:26.482
Yeah. Good idea. Wait for me.

50:33.281 --> 50:34.490
Molly?

50:36.451 --> 50:37.952
Oh!

50:38.035 --> 50:39.495
Oh, God, it's you.

50:39.579 --> 50:41.456
Have you seen a dog?

50:41.539 --> 50:42.707
It's Rory's dog.

50:42.790 --> 50:44.375
It's the guy
that's gone missing.

50:44.459 --> 50:46.335
I don't know if you know...

50:47.503 --> 50:50.089
Hey, are you all right, Eoin?

50:54.260 --> 50:55.887
My da hates me.

50:56.596 --> 50:59.015
Hey, listen, um...

50:59.098 --> 51:02.393
Hate's a strong word.
I mean, you're his son and...

51:07.064 --> 51:08.733
Why would he do that?

51:11.444 --> 51:12.779
He says...

51:14.405 --> 51:18.451
He says when I was born,
I killed my mammy, and...

51:18.534 --> 51:19.952
it...

51:20.870 --> 51:22.872
it should've been me
and not her.

51:23.790 --> 51:25.666
Jesus Christ.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.544
Sorry.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.838
They all hate me.

51:30.922 --> 51:32.715
I'm not like them.

51:34.133 --> 51:39.430
I'm not clever or funny
or cool. I...

51:39.514 --> 51:41.849
I'm just a big, useless
fuckin' spud.

51:41.933 --> 51:44.644
Shh. Come on, don't cry.
That's not true.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.396
What the fuck would you know?

51:47.480 --> 51:51.984
I actually do know, okay?
This is what bullies do.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.611
Okay? They make you...

51:53.694 --> 51:56.072
They make you think
that you're worthless,

51:56.155 --> 51:58.950
and... and they abuse you.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.076
I've not been abused.

52:00.159 --> 52:02.578
Come on,
look at those bruises, Eoin.

52:02.662 --> 52:05.081
-You need to tell someone.
-You can't tell anyone.

52:05.164 --> 52:08.918
-You have to tell someone.
-No, you can't tell anyone.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.336
Okay, okay.

52:11.379 --> 52:14.090
-I won't tell anyone.

52:14.173 --> 52:15.925
I'm gonna help you.

52:16.759 --> 52:18.761
But you've gotta be strong.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.680
-I am strong.
-No, I mean...

52:20.763 --> 52:22.473
I mean, up here.

52:26.978 --> 52:32.316
My da says the English
are all selfish, greedy cunts,

52:32.400 --> 52:35.319
but... you're sound.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.489
Oh, did he now?

52:38.573 --> 52:39.615
Thank you.

52:39.699 --> 52:42.910
No one's ever been this kind
to me before.

52:45.621 --> 52:48.165
Okay. Well, you can let go
of my hand now, okay?

52:51.544 --> 52:52.879
I really like you.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.464
You're starting
to hurt me now.

52:55.548 --> 52:57.592
No, no... No, no, no, Eoin.

52:57.675 --> 52:58.843
Help!

52:58.926 --> 53:00.636
Eoin. Please...
Please don't hurt me.

53:41.177 --> 53:42.887
Oliver Cromwell.

53:44.347 --> 53:46.641
Fucking Hobnobs!

53:46.724 --> 53:48.809
-Prick!
-Jamie?

53:49.727 --> 53:51.062
Jamie?

54:00.696 --> 54:03.199
Daddy and the others,
are they here?

54:03.282 --> 54:06.285
No, it's...
it's just you and me.

54:07.328 --> 54:08.412
Why?

54:09.997 --> 54:11.540
Maya?

54:12.708 --> 54:14.418
Hey, what's up, baby?

54:16.921 --> 54:18.673
Is it our baby?

54:18.756 --> 54:20.591
I have something to show you.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.262
Okay.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.101
-Darling...
-Shh, shh.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.979
Look...
shall we go back to the house?

54:33.062 --> 54:34.522
Shh.

54:35.398 --> 54:37.441
-What are you doing?
-Follow me.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.485
-Maya, where are you...?

54:39.568 --> 54:41.362
It's here. It happened right here.

54:41.445 --> 54:42.738
Maya, Maya! Maya, come on.

54:42.822 --> 54:44.907
Eventually you're gonna have
to tell me what's going on.

54:44.991 --> 54:46.575
Eoin tried to kill me.

54:47.535 --> 54:49.870
-He... he what?
-Yeah.

54:49.954 --> 54:51.914
What... what did
he do to you? Where is he?

54:51.998 --> 54:53.332
I'll fucking kill him!

54:53.416 --> 54:54.667
No, no, no, he's already dead.
He's already dead.

54:54.750 --> 54:57.712
I, um, kneed him in the balls
because he tried to attack me.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.089
And then...
and then he held me down here.

55:00.172 --> 55:01.298
-What?
-I couldn't breathe.

55:01.382 --> 55:03.384
I thought I was gonna die.
I thought, "This is it."

55:03.467 --> 55:04.802
And then they came out
of the woods.

55:04.885 --> 55:06.554
-They? Who is they?
-There was a light.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.931
-Who came out of the woods?
-And then I screamed for help

55:09.015 --> 55:10.307
-and they came.
-Who... who came?

55:10.391 --> 55:12.518
The Far Darrig.
The Little People.

55:13.394 --> 55:15.521
-The Little People?
-Yeah, they had these knives

55:15.604 --> 55:16.856
and cloaks and, fuck me,

55:16.939 --> 55:18.941
when I say this out loud,
I know...

55:19.025 --> 55:21.235
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.653
It's okay. Just look at me.

55:22.737 --> 55:23.738
Look, is there any chance

55:23.821 --> 55:26.949
this is, you know,
just... baby brain?

55:27.033 --> 55:29.035
I didn't fucking imagine this.

55:29.118 --> 55:32.371
-But this is...
-No, no. He was dragged here.

55:32.455 --> 55:34.749
He was... he was dragged here
and then...

55:34.832 --> 55:37.543
Ha! There! There!
Look at this! Explain that!

55:37.626 --> 55:38.711
Explain it.

55:39.587 --> 55:41.881
Wait... what am I looking at here?

55:41.964 --> 55:43.507
It's... it's blood, isn't it?

55:43.591 --> 55:45.593
Maybe your brain blocked
what really happened.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.969
Oh, fuck's sake, Jamie.
Fuck's sake.

55:47.053 --> 55:48.387
Look, all I'm saying is that

55:48.471 --> 55:49.847
maybe he's done
a runner, okay?

55:49.930 --> 55:51.807
He attacked you,
you kicked him in the balls,

55:51.891 --> 55:55.561
or you... you cut him,
and... and he's done a runner.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.354
No, that's...
that's not what happened.

55:57.438 --> 56:00.483
Maya. Maya. Try and see this
from my point of view, okay?

56:00.566 --> 56:02.526
Look, what is more likely?

56:03.778 --> 56:05.321
What is more likely?

56:06.614 --> 56:08.616
There's a hut.
Okay, there's a hut.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.534
Deeper into the woods,
and it was this way.

56:10.618 --> 56:12.620
And it's, um,
made out of stone.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.371
-It looks like a beehive.
-All right.

56:14.455 --> 56:16.582
And I think there were fucking
human bones in there.

56:16.665 --> 56:18.250
-But Molly showed me.
-Who is Molly?

56:18.334 --> 56:19.627
You know, Rory's dog, Molly.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.711
All right, no, come on.

56:20.795 --> 56:21.837
Let's...
let's go back to the house.

56:21.921 --> 56:23.464
You're clearly
under a lot of stress.

56:23.547 --> 56:25.591
-No, this isn't stress.
-Then what is it?

56:25.674 --> 56:27.343
What is it?

56:29.428 --> 56:30.888
You shout more.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.933
-What?
-You know, since that night,

56:34.016 --> 56:37.228
you shout more.
And you're punching things.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.939
That's not the Jamie I know.
I married a nice guy.

56:40.022 --> 56:42.024
And look where that got me!

56:42.108 --> 56:45.319
Yeah. And I was beaten, too,
but you don't see me...

56:45.402 --> 56:47.530
And I had to watch...
I had to watch!

56:47.613 --> 56:49.907
As they threatened you
and my baby

56:49.990 --> 56:51.408
and I couldn't do a thing!

56:52.576 --> 56:53.994
Do you know what that's like?

56:54.328 --> 56:56.372
Do you know
what that's like for a man?

56:57.957 --> 56:59.834
Of course you fucking don't.

57:00.543 --> 57:02.670
And it is my solemn promise

57:02.753 --> 57:07.091
that I will never, ever allow
that to happen to you again.

57:09.218 --> 57:10.970
Where are you going?

57:11.053 --> 57:12.805
We're going home.

57:12.888 --> 57:14.640
And then I'm going to the pub.

57:38.247 --> 57:39.790
I'm gonna try one more time.

57:39.874 --> 57:41.250
He better fuckin' answer!

57:41.333 --> 57:43.627
Eoin, you big fat dope.
Where are you?

57:43.711 --> 57:45.796
Da's going mental.
Answer your phone!

57:45.880 --> 57:47.715
Eoin, we're renting
your room out, yeah?

57:47.798 --> 57:48.883
So just fuck off and die.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.676
Don't bother comin'...

57:50.759 --> 57:52.553
Seriously, look, Da says
all is forgiven, yeah?

57:52.636 --> 57:54.471
Just call us back.

57:54.555 --> 57:57.099
-Prick.
-No sign of your brother, huh?

57:57.183 --> 57:59.101
Are you listening in
on my call?

57:59.185 --> 58:01.604
-Nosy bitch.
-First Rory, now Eoin.

58:01.687 --> 58:03.856
Call the guards, Aisling.
Time to get them involved.

58:03.939 --> 58:06.901
With all due respect, Father,
shut the fuck up.

58:06.984 --> 58:08.569
There's our man.

58:12.031 --> 58:13.115
Come on.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.873
We've been looking for you,
handsome.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.291
-Oh, you have?
-Mm-hm.

58:22.374 --> 58:23.626
Where's Eoin?

58:23.709 --> 58:26.045
I... I don't know.

58:29.256 --> 58:30.883
what are you doing?

58:30.966 --> 58:32.009
You got something
in your teeth?

58:32.092 --> 58:33.594
Oh, Ash knows
how to spot a liar.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.972
I'm... I'm not lying.

58:37.056 --> 58:39.016
Well, she's never wrong,
though, so...

58:39.099 --> 58:40.935
if you've anything to hide,
she'll find it.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.394
No, no, seriously,
I'm not lying.

58:42.478 --> 58:45.147
I haven't seen Eoin since...
this morning.

58:46.106 --> 58:48.651
You're such an uptight,
frustrated little man, Jamie,

58:48.734 --> 58:50.110
aren't ya?
I mean, look at you.

58:50.194 --> 58:51.862
You're like a can of Coke.

58:51.946 --> 58:53.280
You're all shook up
but there's no one

58:53.364 --> 58:54.615
to crack the ring-pull.

58:56.408 --> 58:58.494
So does he know
where Eoin is or what?

59:00.287 --> 59:01.872
He knows something.

59:01.956 --> 59:04.124
Just tell us, Jamie.
Just release all that tension.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.751
Leave the lad alone.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.795
Will you mind your own
business, you tramp?

59:07.878 --> 59:11.423
This is our business.
He lives in our village.

59:11.507 --> 59:13.550
-For, like, five minutes.
-You're barred.

59:15.094 --> 59:16.303
I think you should leave now.

59:16.387 --> 59:18.097
Yeah, not till we
take care of this, all right?

59:18.180 --> 59:19.890
Oh, we all know
how you Whelans

59:19.974 --> 59:21.058
take care of things.

59:21.141 --> 59:22.142
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

59:22.851 --> 59:25.896
Well, if you know anything,
or you hear anything,

59:25.980 --> 59:27.106
you come to us.

59:28.148 --> 59:29.316
To us.

59:29.400 --> 59:32.403
And not your wives
or your husbands,

59:32.486 --> 59:34.780
and not to Niamh or the local
fuckin' gossip, all right?

59:34.863 --> 59:36.699
And don't go
to the fuckin' guards!

59:36.782 --> 59:39.285
-You come to us. All right?
-Yeah.

59:39.368 --> 59:41.412
That's it now. Come on. Out!

59:41.495 --> 59:43.038
Bye, Jamie.

59:46.959 --> 59:49.420
The Guinness
is shite in here, anyway.

59:52.673 --> 59:54.466
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

59:54.550 --> 59:56.677
-I am so sorry.
-No, don't worry.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.138
Thank you for sticking up
for me, though.

1:00:00.097 --> 1:00:02.141
-Will you have another pint?
-Love one.

1:00:02.224 --> 1:00:04.435
-Good man.
-Thank you.

1:00:32.338 --> 1:00:35.174
Fuck.

1:00:51.774 --> 1:00:53.400
Help me!

1:00:59.740 --> 1:01:02.076
Help!

1:01:37.694 --> 1:01:39.405
Oh, fuck.

1:01:56.922 --> 1:01:58.549
Oh, fuck.

1:02:11.812 --> 1:02:13.981
Amumma wikka babby.

1:02:17.151 --> 1:02:18.777
Amumma! Ah!

1:02:21.905 --> 1:02:25.117
Oh, come on! Fuck!

1:02:27.536 --> 1:02:29.204
-Oh...

1:02:38.213 --> 1:02:40.924
Fuck! Okay, Okay...

1:02:46.096 --> 1:02:49.141
Fuck!

1:02:49.224 --> 1:02:52.144


1:02:54.229 --> 1:02:55.772


1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:51.078
Hi, darling.
Do you know that Krav Maga...?

1:03:52.037 --> 1:03:53.539
-What are you...?
-Shh, shh, shh.

1:03:53.622 --> 1:03:54.623
I was only gone
for a couple...

1:03:54.706 --> 1:03:55.791
I have something to show you.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:57.918
You what?

1:03:58.627 --> 1:04:00.796
Jesus, this is the last time
I go to the fucking pub.

1:04:00.879 --> 1:04:02.548
Ow, babe, ow!
You're hurting me.

1:04:02.631 --> 1:04:05.384
-Look in the bag.
-Why?

1:04:07.052 --> 1:04:08.136
What are you fucking on about?

1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:09.221
Do you believe me now?

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:10.597
Oh, fuck me, that's a head!

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:14.226
-That is a fucking head.
-I know. I know.

1:04:17.729 --> 1:04:19.606
-What did you do?
-What did I do?

1:04:19.690 --> 1:04:21.942
I... I didn't do anything.
That... that wasn't me.

1:04:22.025 --> 1:04:23.318
Okay, I saw one.

1:04:23.402 --> 1:04:24.987
It came through
the French windows

1:04:25.070 --> 1:04:27.781
and it casually just
dropped it off like it was...

1:04:27.864 --> 1:04:30.367
a fucking pizza delivery boy.

1:04:30.450 --> 1:04:33.203
Ah, a-ha. I got photos.
I took loads of...

1:04:33.287 --> 1:04:36.039
I took loads of photos.
Took loads of photos. Um...

1:04:36.123 --> 1:04:38.417
Shit, they came out
really weird.

1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:41.003
I think it's their idea
of a gift.

1:04:41.795 --> 1:04:43.672
-Whose... whose idea?
-The Little People.

1:04:43.755 --> 1:04:45.257
The Redcaps. The Far Darrig.

1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:47.634
They're real.
Baby, they're real.

1:04:47.718 --> 1:04:51.638
And they killed Eoin. And we
need to take it to the police.

1:04:51.722 --> 1:04:52.723
And tell them what?

1:04:52.806 --> 1:04:53.807
That he was decapitated

1:04:53.890 --> 1:04:55.809
by a bunch
of fucking leprechauns?

1:04:58.562 --> 1:04:59.813
Oh, God.

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:01.231
-Oh, fuck, oh, fuck...
-Oh...

1:05:01.315 --> 1:05:02.566
Hide that, stay out of sight.

1:05:02.649 --> 1:05:03.900
-I'm gonna get rid of them.

1:05:17.456 --> 1:05:20.375
Uh... Who is it?

1:05:20.459 --> 1:05:22.127
I want answers, Jamie!

1:05:23.337 --> 1:05:25.464
Look, sorry, it...
it's really late.

1:05:25.547 --> 1:05:27.341
We're actually
just going to bed.

1:05:27.424 --> 1:05:29.343
Where's my boy?

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:30.844
Look, Daddy...

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:34.389
Colm, I have... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:05:34.473 --> 1:05:36.058
He never left this place!

1:05:36.141 --> 1:05:38.352
I think you know
what happened!

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:40.854
No,
we had nothing to do with it.

1:05:41.938 --> 1:05:42.981
Nothing to do with what?

1:05:43.774 --> 1:05:45.692
Nothing, nothing. We had
nothing to do with nothing.

1:05:45.776 --> 1:05:48.111
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you do! You do!

1:05:48.195 --> 1:05:50.280
You do! You do! You do!

1:05:50.364 --> 1:05:54.117
You pricks know something!
Now open this fucking door!

1:05:54.201 --> 1:05:57.496
Whoa! Leave now or I...
I am calling the police!

1:05:57.579 --> 1:06:00.207
-I... I'm dialing.

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:01.958
All right, calm yourself.

1:06:02.042 --> 1:06:04.252
We're... we're going now.

1:06:07.881 --> 1:06:09.549
Come on, kids!

1:06:18.767 --> 1:06:22.062
Oh, fuck me.
Maya, where's your phone?

1:06:22.145 --> 1:06:24.189
-Jesus!

1:06:25.148 --> 1:06:26.608
-Get out!

1:06:26.692 --> 1:06:29.361
Go away.
You... you can't do this!

1:06:29.444 --> 1:06:31.530
Jamie, me boy,

1:06:32.322 --> 1:06:36.743
when it comes to my family,
I do whatever I want.

1:06:54.886 --> 1:06:57.097
-Jamie, listen.

1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:00.142
If it was an accident,
I understand. Hm?

1:07:00.225 --> 1:07:01.852
Eoin's a clumsy fucker

1:07:01.935 --> 1:07:04.604
and I've been making excuses
for him for long enough.

1:07:04.688 --> 1:07:07.065
If he touched your missus,

1:07:07.149 --> 1:07:09.860
he has form there too,
and... and I'm sorry.

1:07:09.943 --> 1:07:11.820
-But you have to let me know.

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:12.904
Okay...

1:07:12.988 --> 1:07:14.781
And I'll be the one
to punish him.

1:07:19.578 --> 1:07:23.540
Where is the good lady
Mrs. Jamie, huh?

1:07:23.623 --> 1:07:27.085
She's uncharacteristically
quiet.

1:07:30.005 --> 1:07:33.091
Aw. What have we got...

1:07:35.594 --> 1:07:38.472
You're not
answering me, Jamie boy.

1:07:38.555 --> 1:07:41.725
What? What?

1:07:41.808 --> 1:07:44.352
You're probably
thinking of some other way

1:07:44.436 --> 1:07:46.021
-to get help.
-Shit!

1:07:46.104 --> 1:07:50.066
Let me reassure you,
this is not my first rodeo.

1:08:01.328 --> 1:08:03.413
No, no, no... Fuck!

1:08:05.248 --> 1:08:07.834
Last chance, Jamie.

1:08:14.132 --> 1:08:15.759
What is it?

1:08:15.842 --> 1:08:16.927
They...

1:08:18.178 --> 1:08:19.846
-What?
-They...

1:08:21.807 --> 1:08:24.351
What? Jesus!

1:08:27.062 --> 1:08:28.688
-Oh, fuck!

1:08:29.648 --> 1:08:32.400
It's...

1:08:33.235 --> 1:08:34.945
-It's Eoin.
-Eoin?

1:08:35.946 --> 1:08:37.072
Eoin!

1:08:37.155 --> 1:08:42.077
Eoin!

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:44.496
Please, we need your help!

1:08:44.579 --> 1:08:46.122
I'll kill him!

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:54.297
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:05.350
Fuck this place up.

1:09:20.615 --> 1:09:21.700
Killian!

1:09:22.784 --> 1:09:24.786
Where are you?
Get the fuck down here!

1:09:27.414 --> 1:09:28.790
Killy!

1:09:32.043 --> 1:09:34.546
Oh! Fuck me!

1:09:56.693 --> 1:09:57.777
Maya.

1:10:17.130 --> 1:10:19.299
-Fuck!

1:10:21.509 --> 1:10:23.720
Come on, fucker. Try me!

1:10:25.847 --> 1:10:27.223
Go on. Go on.

1:10:27.307 --> 1:10:28.850
Get out! Get out!

1:10:28.934 --> 1:10:30.769
Fuck! Oh!

1:10:36.816 --> 1:10:38.360
You all right there, fella?

1:10:38.443 --> 1:10:39.444
Looks like
you're getting ready

1:10:39.527 --> 1:10:40.570
to make breakfast, huh?

1:10:40.654 --> 1:10:41.988
Oh-ho-ho!

1:10:42.072 --> 1:10:44.616
Come on, then.
You gonna do this?

1:10:44.699 --> 1:10:46.618
Come on.

1:10:46.701 --> 1:10:47.786
Come on.

1:10:47.869 --> 1:10:48.954
What are you waiting for?

1:10:52.082 --> 1:10:53.792
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1:10:53.875 --> 1:10:55.835
I'm sorry. I... I...

1:10:55.919 --> 1:10:57.337
I didn't mean to...

1:11:01.508 --> 1:11:03.051
Oh, God, no.

1:11:03.134 --> 1:11:04.970
Oh, God, no.

1:11:05.053 --> 1:11:07.180
Please, God, this isn't fair.

1:11:07.263 --> 1:11:09.140
No, no, this isn't fair.

1:11:11.434 --> 1:11:14.104
We just came here
for some peace.

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:16.731
We just wanted some peace
for our baby.

1:11:16.815 --> 1:11:19.275
Are you...
are you fucking crying?

1:11:19.359 --> 1:11:21.027
This isn't fair.

1:11:21.111 --> 1:11:23.446
Fair? Look at me, look at me!

1:11:23.530 --> 1:11:25.699
When you fight like a girl...

1:11:25.782 --> 1:11:27.742
No! Oh, please...

1:11:27.826 --> 1:11:29.619
...you get fucked like a girl.

1:11:30.787 --> 1:11:34.082
No, no, no, no. No, no...

1:11:34.165 --> 1:11:37.585
How's that for fair?
How's that for fair?

1:11:42.007 --> 1:11:44.718
Killian? Have you got him?

1:11:50.598 --> 1:11:51.975
Fuck!

1:11:52.058 --> 1:11:54.978
Hello, hello? Oh, fuck, fuck.

1:11:55.061 --> 1:11:57.689
Yes. Yes!

1:11:57.772 --> 1:11:58.940
Hello?

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:05.280
Please, I need your help!
Hello?

1:12:06.448 --> 1:12:07.657
Please!

1:12:08.992 --> 1:12:10.785
Is anyone there?

1:12:21.963 --> 1:12:25.091
I'll give you
anything you want.

1:12:25.175 --> 1:12:26.384
Killian!

1:12:26.468 --> 1:12:29.721
I'm in here, Da!
He's crying like a baby.

1:12:29.804 --> 1:12:32.515
Aren't ya? Like a little
fuckin' baby, huh?

1:12:32.599 --> 1:12:36.603
Jesus!
Look at the state of ya.

1:12:37.854 --> 1:12:39.731
I don't know what happened
to Eoin.

1:12:39.814 --> 1:12:41.441
Oh, well...

1:12:43.109 --> 1:12:45.361
I've got his head. Hmm?

1:12:46.571 --> 1:12:49.115
-Now where's the rest of him?
-Eoin's head? What?

1:12:49.199 --> 1:12:50.658
Shut up, Killian.

1:12:51.993 --> 1:12:54.287
I just want to bury
me son, hmm?

1:12:55.288 --> 1:12:57.207
All of him.

1:12:57.290 --> 1:13:00.210
-Now, where is he?
-I don't know.

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:02.504
No?

1:13:03.421 --> 1:13:06.841
Ah, but your wife does,
doesn't she? Huh?

1:13:08.551 --> 1:13:12.055
Oh! Oh, bejaysus,
look at that.

1:13:12.138 --> 1:13:13.681
You stabbed him in the back,
huh?

1:13:13.765 --> 1:13:15.517
You're a right fuckin' hero,
aren't ya?

1:13:16.893 --> 1:13:22.357
Now, are you gonna tell me
what I want to know?

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:25.819
-Huh? Huh?
-Oh, please.

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:27.904
I'll tell you.

1:13:27.987 --> 1:13:29.447
I'll tell you. I'll tell you,

1:13:29.531 --> 1:13:31.032
but you're not
going to like it.

1:13:32.158 --> 1:13:33.827
Try me.

1:13:33.910 --> 1:13:35.870
It was the Far Darrig.

1:13:36.788 --> 1:13:37.956
The Redcaps.

1:13:38.039 --> 1:13:40.708
You know, the Little People.
They're real.

1:13:40.792 --> 1:13:43.378
Killian, stop it!
Jesus Christ.

1:13:44.921 --> 1:13:48.883
You know,
I came up here to kill you.

1:13:49.676 --> 1:13:54.514
But if you tell me
where the person is

1:13:54.597 --> 1:13:57.809
that knows what happened
to my son,

1:13:57.892 --> 1:14:00.979
maybe, maybe...
I won't have to.

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:05.441
So are you gonna tell me
where I can find

1:14:05.525 --> 1:14:08.820
that English bitch whore
you call a wife?

1:14:36.347 --> 1:14:38.224
No, no, no, not now.

1:14:40.935 --> 1:14:43.813
Da! Da, she's here!

1:14:45.982 --> 1:14:48.234
Da, that stuck-up bitch is here!

1:14:48.318 --> 1:14:49.944
Good. Good.

1:14:55.825 --> 1:14:57.327
You killed my brother.

1:14:58.703 --> 1:15:00.371
You bitch!

1:15:10.048 --> 1:15:11.633
I'm gonna rip your head off.

1:15:12.967 --> 1:15:15.178
I guess we don't need him
any more, huh?

1:15:15.261 --> 1:15:16.763
-Look at me.
-Shh.

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:18.973
Kill that useless
streak of piss, Killian.

1:15:19.432 --> 1:15:20.892
-Really?
-No.

1:15:20.975 --> 1:15:23.394
It's time you became a man, son.

1:15:23.478 --> 1:15:24.938
No...

1:15:25.021 --> 1:15:26.522
-No.

1:15:26.606 --> 1:15:28.775
-I'll make you proud, Da.
-No.

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:31.736
Please, please, please don't
kill me. Please don't kill me.

1:15:31.819 --> 1:15:34.322
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.

1:15:34.405 --> 1:15:39.035
What...
What if the police catch you?

1:15:39.827 --> 1:15:42.455
You'll regret this.
You will. You will.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:44.499
Oh, no, this is it.
This is it.

1:15:46.251 --> 1:15:50.046
Maya, I love you, I love you...

1:15:58.388 --> 1:16:00.181
What the fuck is that?

1:16:07.021 --> 1:16:09.232
Da, get it off me!

1:16:13.945 --> 1:16:17.365
-What is it?
-A big fuckin' rat?

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:20.451
It's wearing clothes.

1:16:20.535 --> 1:16:22.662
Or is it some sort of monkey?

1:16:22.745 --> 1:16:24.956
It's wearing clothes!

1:16:25.039 --> 1:16:27.292
Well, monkeys wear clothes
in the circus.

1:16:27.375 --> 1:16:29.002
You should be
in the fuckin' circus.

1:16:29.085 --> 1:16:31.337
You've the brains of a rocking
horse, do you know that?

1:16:42.390 --> 1:16:43.808
-Killian.
-Yeah?

1:16:43.891 --> 1:16:45.768
Go out to the van
and get the gun.

1:16:45.852 --> 1:16:48.146
-What?
-Go on!

1:16:51.149 --> 1:16:52.191
No.

1:16:52.275 --> 1:16:55.194
No! Daddy, no!

1:17:07.498 --> 1:17:08.624
Get it.

1:17:08.708 --> 1:17:10.918
-Yes, get it.

1:17:16.174 --> 1:17:18.676
-Fuck you!

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.762

1:17:39.072 --> 1:17:40.615
Oh, for fuck...

1:18:18.319 --> 1:18:20.113
Not so smart now, are ya?

1:18:20.196 --> 1:18:22.281
Oh, yeah, look at your brains.

1:18:22.365 --> 1:18:23.741
You like that, do ya?

1:18:35.503 --> 1:18:36.838
Stopped it.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:41.342
Stopped it fidgeting.

1:18:41.426 --> 1:18:43.010
What are you gonna do,
give me the bumps?

1:18:43.094 --> 1:18:45.179
Wriggly piggly girl, ain't ya?

1:18:45.263 --> 1:18:48.683
-Belly burst!

1:18:49.517 --> 1:18:50.810
Back we go.

1:18:53.271 --> 1:18:55.231
Da!

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:05.450
No, no...

1:19:13.166 --> 1:19:15.793
So, who wants to see me
cut her again?

1:19:15.877 --> 1:19:17.378
Shall I cut her again?

1:19:17.462 --> 1:19:19.297
Look. Look!

1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:22.467
See what happens
to nasty girls!

1:19:28.848 --> 1:19:30.016
Da...

1:19:31.392 --> 1:19:32.602
Da!

1:19:34.103 --> 1:19:35.813
Da!

1:19:55.208 --> 1:19:57.251
-Hey, Killian.

1:19:57.335 --> 1:19:59.587
Look what they did to me, Da!
Look what they fucking did!

1:19:59.670 --> 1:20:01.506
Open the door,

1:20:01.589 --> 1:20:02.590
Fuck off!

1:20:02.673 --> 1:20:03.841
-Get out of there!

1:20:03.925 --> 1:20:05.718
-Come on!

1:20:06.385 --> 1:20:08.346
-Fuck! Hey, Da!

1:20:10.973 --> 1:20:13.017
Help, Da!

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:19.565
Come here to me, son. Come here.

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:25.821
Jesus, Jesus!
Oh, Killian. Killian...

1:20:25.905 --> 1:20:29.158
-No, no, no, no...

1:20:31.744 --> 1:20:34.038
Listen, son...

1:20:35.831 --> 1:20:37.833
I never told you this, but...

1:20:38.793 --> 1:20:40.378
I'm proud of ya.

1:20:41.379 --> 1:20:43.381
I'm so proud of ya.

1:20:44.382 --> 1:20:46.467
I... I've al...

1:20:46.551 --> 1:20:48.469
I've always been proud of ya.

1:21:09.323 --> 1:21:10.700
Maya.

1:21:10.783 --> 1:21:13.411
Maya!

1:21:13.494 --> 1:21:14.787
Jamie!

1:21:17.665 --> 1:21:19.292
That's mine! Mine!

1:21:20.293 --> 1:21:21.544
-No, no, no!

1:21:21.627 --> 1:21:22.628
No hitting.

1:21:22.712 --> 1:21:24.130
They helped us. They helped us.

1:21:24.213 --> 1:21:26.924
-Silly billy.
-They're real.

1:21:27.925 --> 1:21:29.885
They're fucking real.
They're fucking real.

1:21:29.969 --> 1:21:32.638
Fucking told you, didn't I?

1:21:32.722 --> 1:21:34.181
-Okay.

1:21:35.558 --> 1:21:37.351
We need to call an ambulance.

1:21:37.435 --> 1:21:39.020
-We need to call an ambulance.

1:21:39.103 --> 1:21:40.938
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1:21:41.022 --> 1:21:42.523
How do we explain this?

1:21:42.607 --> 1:21:43.983
Yummy. Yum.

1:21:44.066 --> 1:21:45.818
-Okay, breathe.

1:21:45.901 --> 1:21:47.445
Get away from my girl!

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:52.825
-What? Huh? No!

1:21:52.908 --> 1:21:54.577
To the clochán, run!

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:56.495
-Run. Get away! Get away!

1:21:57.622 --> 1:22:00.750
Aisling...

1:22:01.876 --> 1:22:03.085
Aisling...

1:22:05.129 --> 1:22:06.881
It's okay, just breathe.

1:22:08.341 --> 1:22:10.843
Okay. It's all right. Breathe.

1:22:12.970 --> 1:22:14.972
Yes, just breathe.

1:22:20.728 --> 1:22:23.522
What did you do
to my beautiful angel?

1:22:23.606 --> 1:22:25.608
Not this time.

1:22:26.859 --> 1:22:29.654
-No, no, no, Jamie! No, no...
-Hey. Hey.

1:22:29.737 --> 1:22:33.199
It's always been you and me
versus the rest of the world.

1:22:43.292 --> 1:22:45.169
Let's settle this like men.

1:22:48.214 --> 1:22:50.299
-No, no, no, no, no...

1:22:50.383 --> 1:22:52.802
Fuck! Maya!

1:22:52.885 --> 1:22:54.345
-Redcaps?

1:22:55.971 --> 1:22:57.640
Fuck me!

1:22:59.975 --> 1:23:02.395
My mother used to
tell me stories.

1:23:03.479 --> 1:23:04.939
People would...

1:23:05.773 --> 1:23:08.984
ask for favours,
for gold, for love...

1:23:13.239 --> 1:23:15.950
But there was always
a price to pay.

1:23:19.245 --> 1:23:24.250
See... they were
the last of me slugs.

1:23:24.333 --> 1:23:25.876
Heavy duty ones, you know,

1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:27.878
that would blow
your fuckin' brains out!

1:23:27.962 --> 1:23:31.716
-These are just... birdshot.

1:23:32.633 --> 1:23:33.676
I'll have to get
right up close

1:23:33.759 --> 1:23:34.760
to finish him off.

1:23:34.844 --> 1:23:36.929
Please, please,
please, please, don't kill us.

1:23:37.012 --> 1:23:38.639
Kill you? No.

1:23:38.723 --> 1:23:40.599
No. From here...

1:23:41.851 --> 1:23:44.729
this will hurt you real bad,
but you'll live.

1:23:46.147 --> 1:23:47.732
Your baby, though...

1:23:49.442 --> 1:23:52.528
You kill my kids,
I'll kill yours!

1:23:58.284 --> 1:23:59.702
-You mutt!

1:24:11.464 --> 1:24:13.466
How close do I need to get?

1:24:24.101 --> 1:24:25.728
Are you okay?

1:24:27.271 --> 1:24:30.775
Of course not, I'm having...
I'm having our baby.

1:24:32.359 --> 1:24:34.528
-Okay. Okay.

1:24:52.922 --> 1:24:54.590
Feast.

1:24:54.673 --> 1:24:56.884
-Just keep breathing, darling.

1:24:56.967 --> 1:24:59.261
Just keep breathing.
It's gonna be okay.

1:24:59.345 --> 1:25:03.265
-Ah! Oh, careful of the glass.

1:25:03.349 --> 1:25:04.767
Come here. Just...

1:25:04.850 --> 1:25:06.977
-Oh, it's okay.
-Ooh!

1:25:07.061 --> 1:25:08.604
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:25:08.687 --> 1:25:11.357
-Okay. Okay.

1:25:16.028 --> 1:25:17.822
-Just breathe, darling.
-I'm scared.

1:25:17.905 --> 1:25:18.906
Just breathe. Don't be scared.

1:25:20.115 --> 1:25:22.284
I'm here. Don't be scared.

1:25:22.368 --> 1:25:24.078
-Don't be scared, I'm here.

1:25:24.161 --> 1:25:27.414
You're doing great.
There, that's it. Go on, push.

1:25:27.498 --> 1:25:29.583
-Okay.

1:25:29.667 --> 1:25:32.211
-Okay.

1:25:32.294 --> 1:25:34.129
-Right, that's it.

1:25:34.213 --> 1:25:35.673
Okay, darling.

1:25:35.756 --> 1:25:38.717
-It's coming.

1:25:50.604 --> 1:25:52.731
-Here it comes. Here it comes.

1:25:52.815 --> 1:25:54.567
-Oh!

1:25:54.650 --> 1:25:56.861
Oh! It's a girl!

1:25:56.944 --> 1:25:59.363
-It's a baby girl.

1:26:05.911 --> 1:26:06.954
Hey!

1:26:07.037 --> 1:26:08.247
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:26:08.330 --> 1:26:11.166
-I'm so proud of you.
-You're okay.

1:26:11.250 --> 1:26:13.669
-Oh, you're okay.

1:26:16.088 --> 1:26:17.840
-Hi.

1:26:58.422 --> 1:27:00.507
-Good day.
-Ah. How are ya?

1:27:00.591 --> 1:27:02.801
I'm... I'm all right. I'm good.

1:27:05.012 --> 1:27:06.388
Cut yourself shaving?

1:27:07.431 --> 1:27:09.058
Something like that.

1:27:09.725 --> 1:27:13.145
-Got any painkillers?
-Ah, sure. Of course.

1:27:35.876 --> 1:27:38.045
I'm gonna go finish
tidying up.

1:27:40.881 --> 1:27:42.967
I've gotta clean up that van.

1:27:45.719 --> 1:27:48.138
Got his blood
all over this house.

1:27:53.727 --> 1:27:55.813
What are we gonna
tell people, eh?

1:27:55.896 --> 1:27:59.024
Shh. Whatever we tell them,

1:27:59.108 --> 1:28:01.735
they're gonna make up their
own stories, aren't they?

1:28:02.653 --> 1:28:05.698
But right this second,
I don't give a shit.

1:28:14.248 --> 1:28:15.541
Yeah.

1:28:18.711 --> 1:28:20.087
Perfect.

1:28:49.950 --> 1:28:52.494
Noise cancellation, high.

1:28:54.288 --> 1:28:56.582
Trauma and -

1:28:56.665 --> 1:28:59.835
Accessing Healing Power
Through Mindfulness,

1:28:59.918 --> 1:29:02.171
by Dr. Mark Oliver.

1:29:03.422 --> 1:29:05.257
To heal from trauma

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:09.136
is to change the perception
of the traumatic episode

1:29:09.219 --> 1:29:11.847
from helplessness to control.

1:29:11.930 --> 1:29:16.393
By following my six simple
methods of disassociation...

1:29:55.724 --> 1:29:58.435
No! No!

1:30:08.821 --> 1:30:11.281
Jamie, where are you?

1:30:11.365 --> 1:30:13.408
Jamie!

1:30:13.492 --> 1:30:15.786
Jamie, they took her!
She's gone!

1:30:18.413 --> 1:30:19.456
Jamie!

1:30:27.881 --> 1:30:29.508
Come on.

1:30:29.591 --> 1:30:31.844
Come on. Okay.

1:30:33.971 --> 1:30:35.180
Okay.

1:32:19.576 --> 1:32:21.411
Give me back my baby.

1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:23.747
My babby.

1:32:23.830 --> 1:32:25.540
Ah! Back, back!

1:32:25.624 --> 1:32:27.542
No, you can't!

1:32:27.626 --> 1:32:30.337
-Out! Out!

1:32:31.922 --> 1:32:36.051
This what happen to me.

1:32:43.267 --> 1:32:45.143
You're Maeve's child?

1:32:46.395 --> 1:32:48.939
You're... you're the one
they took from her.

1:32:51.316 --> 1:32:54.611
Me mammy cried.

1:32:57.072 --> 1:32:59.157
No, please.

1:32:59.241 --> 1:33:00.993
Let me just hold her, please.

1:33:01.076 --> 1:33:03.662
She's here!

1:33:03.745 --> 1:33:08.375
She grow big and strong.

1:33:08.834 --> 1:33:10.419
Take me.

1:33:10.502 --> 1:33:14.673
Please, take me, not her.
Please.

1:33:14.756 --> 1:33:18.010
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Too old.

1:33:20.846 --> 1:33:24.599
-Please.
-Baby cry. Oh...

1:33:24.683 --> 1:33:27.144

No, no...

1:33:32.899 --> 1:33:34.359
Cry babby.

1:33:34.443 --> 1:33:36.695
-Cry babby!

1:33:41.199 --> 1:33:43.660
-Don't do it!

1:33:43.744 --> 1:33:46.371
-Naughty girl.
-Play nice.

1:33:47.289 --> 1:33:50.500
Am I nice, or nasty? Huh?

1:33:50.584 --> 1:33:51.668
Play nice.

1:33:51.752 --> 1:33:53.420

1:33:56.089 --> 1:33:57.758
Killed it! Killed it!

1:34:04.097 --> 1:34:05.098
-No!
-Let me in!

1:34:05.182 --> 1:34:06.600
-No!
-Let me through!

1:34:51.019 --> 1:34:53.105
-Maya!

1:34:54.356 --> 1:34:56.066
Oh.

1:34:56.149 --> 1:34:57.818
Thank God. Hey.

1:35:24.052 --> 1:35:25.554

1:35:26.513 --> 1:35:28.140
You're just in time.

1:35:29.433 --> 1:35:34.896
Mother Redcap. Mother Redcap.

1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:40.819
