<i> ["The Ballad</i>
     <i> Of Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:06.204
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.273 --> 00:08.440
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.509 --> 00:13.111
¶ That started from this tropic
port aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:13.180 --> 00:15.413
¶ The mate was a mighty
    sailing man ¶

00:15.482 --> 00:17.616
¶ The skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.685 --> 00:19.985
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.053 --> 00:22.254
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.323 --> 00:24.723
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:27.227 --> 00:29.361
¶ The weather
    started getting rough ¶

00:29.430 --> 00:31.830
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.898 --> 00:34.299
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.368 --> 00:36.468
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.537 --> 00:38.836
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.905 --> 00:41.240
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore of this ¶

00:41.308 --> 00:43.675
¶ Uncharted desert isle ¶

00:43.744 --> 00:46.144
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:46.213 --> 00:48.446
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.515 --> 00:50.615

00:50.684 --> 00:52.951
¶ And his wife ¶

00:53.020 --> 00:55.654
¶ The movie star ¶

(Skipper)
          'Gilligan!'

01:43.037 --> 01:45.170
'Where are you?'

01:50.878 --> 01:52.144
'Gilligan!'

01:55.182 --> 01:56.448
'Gilligan!'

01:57.184 --> 01:59.118
Gilligan, where are you?

02:00.487 --> 02:02.053
Didn't you hear me
call you little buddy?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.022
Uh-huh.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.857
And what did you lock up
in the cabin?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.125
Nothing.

02:07.194 --> 02:09.294
Oh, Gilligan, how can you
lock up nothing?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.463
Well, it's hard. You gotta get
  a good grip on it.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.298
Get your legs apart
            and give it a good..

02:13.367 --> 02:16.034
Are you saying in other words
you don't want to tell me.

02:16.102 --> 02:17.368
Yup.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.871
Gilligan, I'll tell
      you something.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.507
I'm not interested.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.811
[melodramatic music]

02:41.562 --> 02:43.728
The key is on top
of the cupboard.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.797
Thanks, Gilligan.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.912
- That wasn't very funny.
 - I was trying to be helpful.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.284
- Oh, it's empty.
       - Right.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.286
Absolutely nothing.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.589
But there used to be something.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.398
[instrumental music]

03:26.406 --> 03:28.473
- 'Aha!'
           - Aha!

03:28.542 --> 03:29.574
Aha!

03:29.643 --> 03:31.676
Skipper, what are you
     doing up there?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.912
What's more important is
 what are you doing down there.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.649
Skipper, If I were you,
   I'd get out of that tree.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.919
Gilligan, I'm not moving until
I've learned your little secret.

03:40.988 --> 03:45.023
- It's no secret. See.
   - What is that, may I ask?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.691
It's honey, I got a sweet tooth.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.893
Sometimes, I pull out
     a piece of honeycomb.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.430
Don't you know better than to
 stick your hand in a beehive?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.799
It's not dangerous.
 Honey drips down to the hole.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.701
The bees come in and out
    right by your--

03:56.770 --> 03:59.370
That is the silliest thing
   I've ever heard..

03:59.439 --> 04:01.673
Heard, heard!

04:05.112 --> 04:07.211
[screaming]

04:07.280 --> 04:10.415
See, see, I told you so.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.718
Could it be a black pearl?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.920
Well, that's possible.
     That's very possible.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.458
I bet that he's got bagful, and
he's not sharing them with us.

04:19.526 --> 04:23.361
Oh, Gilligan wouldn't do that.
 Well, he's our friend.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.297
A girl's best friend is a..

04:25.366 --> 04:28.766
- Diamond!
   - Geologically impossible.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.168
A ruby.

04:30.236 --> 04:32.470
Southeast Asia.

04:32.539 --> 04:36.408
- An emerald.
  - India and the China coast.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.311
Professor, what is it
           that Gilligan has

04:39.380 --> 04:42.847
that's fabulously valuable
 that fits in a space like this?

04:42.916 --> 04:45.516
An eight-year-old
               bottle of scotch.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.386
We haven't been on this island
for eight years.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.188
Five-year-old
               bottle of scotch?

04:50.257 --> 04:53.658
What makes you think that
he's hiding liquid refreshments?

04:53.727 --> 04:56.695
It's the Howell instinct.
       You mark my words.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.530
Gilligan is fermenting
         the juice of the grape.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.668
[instrumental music]

05:07.040 --> 05:08.573
[squealing]

05:08.642 --> 05:10.141
Ginger, what're you
doing in there?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.809
- Where?
        - In that bush.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.445
In the bush? I-I-I was
          looking for something.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.247
- A bird?
           - Yeah.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.049
- Are you a bird watcher?
   - I was looking for a bird.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.819
Me too. I saw a turquoise-browed
motmot and European hoopoe.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.590
- Ooh, must have been fun.
- What kind you're looking for?

05:25.659 --> 05:28.393
- Baltimore oriole.
  - That's a baseball player.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.628
Yeah.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.670
Ah, Gilligan, I've been looking
 for you.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.671
- I'm sure not hard to find.
  - What do you mean?

05:40.740 --> 05:44.342
Everybody's been finding me. Up
in trees, jumping out of bushes.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.511
Just peeking all over
     the place.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.513
Thanks, Mary Ann.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.949
See what I mean?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.550
Need the broom
for spring house-cleaning.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.453
What? In November?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.754
It should be obvious. You've
    hidden something valuable.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.824
Others think you ought
          to share it.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.625
What's so valuable
about a diary?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.093
- A what?
          - My diary.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.129
It's about people on the island.
I call it "Dear diary."

06:05.198 --> 06:08.300
- You've been keeping it hidden?
- Aha. I hid it real good.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.934
- Are you sure?
        - I'm positive.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.872
- I forgot where I hid it.
 - Wait till I tell the others.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.047
That's the valuable possession
 that Gilligan's been hiding.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.116
I thought it was something worth
a fortune like a rare jewel.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.352
I thought it was a bag
     of black pearls.

06:27.421 --> 06:31.422
I know what it was. You can't
fool Thurston Howell the third.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.892
You thought it was
      a bottle of scotch.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.095
Great difference between
a bottle of scotch and a diary.

06:37.163 --> 06:40.231
Not to Dean Martin. Fast.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.401
The mystery has been solved,
he's merely been keeping a diary

06:43.470 --> 06:45.503
of our life here
        on the island.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.039
So, now we can all relax.

06:50.777 --> 06:54.613
<i> (Skipper)</i>
 <i> Hey, wait a minute, I wonder</i>
 <i> what Gilligan wrote about me.</i>

06:54.681 --> 06:57.448
<i> (Ginger)</i>
  <i> Oh, my Gosh! I got to read</i>
  <i> what he wrote.</i>

06:57.517 --> 07:02.454
<i> (Thurston) </i>
    <i> Good heavens! Will he</i>
    <i> defame the Howell name?</i>

07:12.666 --> 07:14.932
- Hi, Gilligan.
        - Hi, Skipper.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.935
- Fish biting good?
      - No, not so good.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.004
You know what I'm gonna do
   after we get rescued?

07:20.073 --> 07:23.541
I'm gonna get myself a new ship.
Guess who'll be my first mate.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.876
- Skinny Dave Davis?
      - 'Guess again.'

07:25.945 --> 07:28.512
- Pats O'Mulligan?
       - No, you.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.415
- Me?
          - Of course.

07:30.484 --> 07:33.585
If people say bad things about
me, nobody would give me a ship.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.320
Who would say bad things
    about you?

07:35.389 --> 07:38.957
If I was to blame for the record
that I was a bad officer

07:39.026 --> 07:41.692
'I couldn't handle men,
people could say those things.'

07:41.761 --> 07:43.294
Yeah, I guess, they could.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.097
In that case, could I have
   just a have wee peek?

07:46.165 --> 07:49.668
- 'A peek at your diary?'
   - No, I couldn't do that.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.904
Gilligan, not even
            where I'm mentioned?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.839
Gilligan, as your skipper,
      I demand it.

07:54.907 --> 07:56.941
I'm sorry, Skipper,
but it's private.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.643
Hand me that diary,
            and that's an order.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.646
- What if I say no?
 - I'll have you put in irons.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.148
I thought you're gonna
make me walk the plank.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.084
The plank, yes. Then
      I'll have you keel-hauled.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.385
Then I'll have you
            drawn and quartered.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.221
- Skipper.
           - What?

08:10.290 --> 08:16.561
- How do you spell quartered?
 - Q-U-A-R-T-E-R-E-D.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.232
Good fishing, little buddy.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.569
- I can't.
    - You don't understand?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.839
I'd like to show you
my diary, but I can't.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.508
- I thought that you liked me.
 - I do.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.178
Don't you want me to be a famous
movie star in the whole world?

08:34.246 --> 08:36.780
- Sure.
   - Then show me your diary.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.249
And I'll take it to Hollywood

08:38.318 --> 08:40.518
and they'll make
           a big motion picture.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.719
- They will?
          - Uh-huh.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.621
Don't you want to be my co-star?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.723
- Me and the movies?
      - Sure.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.093
We'll have lots
      of scenes together.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.528
Kissing scenes.

08:50.596 --> 08:53.365
- And hugging?
         - Uh-huh.

08:53.433 --> 08:58.203
And we'll rehearse it over
   and over and over..

09:01.875 --> 09:05.176
I, Thurston Howell the third.
 Creator of careers.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.312
Builder of men's minds,
shaper of their souls

09:08.381 --> 09:10.181
I hereby do takeover.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.217
Don't think I don't
 appreciate what you're saying.

09:12.286 --> 09:15.152
It's just that
     I don't understand it.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.788
Leave the thinking
       to me, you see.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.224
Hand the diary over to me,
   and I'll publish it.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.292
'I'll make you toast
    to the literary world.'

09:21.360 --> 09:24.228
- 'An author par excellence.'
 - But you'll read it.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.498
Well, as a publisher,
  it'd be my duty to read it.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.602
- I couldn't let you do that.
 - I'm not an ordinary man.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.837
I'm an outstanding
     citizen of community.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.940
A man known for his compassion,
for his consideration.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.342
- Mr. Howell--
      - Will you be quiet?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.512
Man known for his courtesy and
thoughtfulness to his fellowman.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.682
- But Mr. Howell--
       - Shut up!

09:44.751 --> 09:46.317
Mr. Howell, I'm sorry,
          it's private.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.852
Fie, knave.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.688
Mark my words, you cross swords
with Thurston Howell III

09:50.757 --> 09:52.423
the king of the beasts--

09:52.492 --> 09:53.491
- Mr. Howell?
         - Yes.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.460
How do you spell beasts?

09:55.529 --> 09:58.630
Large B-E-A-S-T.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.033
Don't expect me to write
    anything tonight.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.635
Cause you're not
       going to be here.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.872
You've caused me enough trouble,
and you're not going to anymore.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.614
Hey, Skipper.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.052
You see that? I threw it
    into the lagoon.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.888
'Hey, Ginger, I bet that was my
high hard fast one.'

10:23.957 --> 10:27.659
Howell, I bet it went a mile.
 Hey, Mr. Howell did you..

10:36.803 --> 10:39.237
Oh, Gilligan, don't do that,
    don't do that.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.638
Don't do what?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.474
The cupid Larry-Harry, or
   Harry-Larry or whatever it is

10:43.543 --> 10:44.943
they do with those
            dreadful things.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.711
I wouldn't do
a thing like that.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.113
All I was doing was just looking
at the bayonet and..

10:49.182 --> 10:50.948
- You're talking to me.
    - Of course, I am.

10:51.017 --> 10:54.653
I talk to everybody, but I've a
feeling sometime nobody listens.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.188
I want to find out
     why they're mad at me.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.756
Oh, that.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.125
Thurston explained that
    to me all last night.

11:01.194 --> 11:01.959
What did he say?

11:02.028 --> 11:04.562
Something to do with your diary.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.364
How did he put it?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.066
That nasty habit you have
  of always telling the truth.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.703
I wrote down what happened.
  I didn't make anything up.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.704
That's probably why
      it's the truth.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.707
You wouldn't be mad at me.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.341
I wrote I look at you
     like a mother.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.178
Ah, Gilligan,
      that's sweet of you.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.847
But I don't think
       I will mention it.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.250
- Why not?
    - I've an idea that he..

11:25.318 --> 11:28.285
...would rather not be
         considered your father.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.121
I wish they'd all write
    their own diaries

11:30.190 --> 11:32.457
and maybe they'll stop
     being mad at me.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.039
- What are you doing, Gilligan?
- Whittling.

11:49.108 --> 11:52.343
- Must you whittle?
- I won't do if it bothers you.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.012
It bothers me.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.224
- And now?
         - Mumbley-peg.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.927
Gilligan, give me that.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.928
Bayonet..

12:10.997 --> 12:13.164
It's the bayonet we took off
  that Japanese sailor.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.533
He didn't know the war was over.
And he took them all prisoner.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.101
Of course, I remember.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.371
They were all locked up
 in a compound. I rescued them.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.907
- You rescued them?
  - Sure, don't you remember?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.709
He was up sleeping on a tree.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.345
I crept up and took
    the key around his neck.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.859
- Skipper, how you doing?
   - Shh!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.394
Don't bother me,
        I'm doing fine.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.300
- Hi, girls.
          - Hi.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.102
Can you hold it for me?

13:13.192 --> 13:15.392
'Skipper, use this,
  it might go a little faster.'

13:15.461 --> 13:16.995
Thanks.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.470
Gilligan, I have never heard
a more weird fabrication.

13:25.539 --> 13:28.139
You like the way I told it?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.141
Gilligan, I have just
written our experience

13:30.210 --> 13:32.610
with that Japanese
sailor in <i> my</i> diary.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.878
- Your diary?
         - Yes.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.880
So that the whole world
will know the truth

13:35.948 --> 13:37.515
after we're rescued.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.885
In these pages, Gilligan,
   is <i> exactly</i> what happened.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.687
Why, if it hadn't been
     for my heroic feats

13:42.756 --> 13:44.355
'you wouldn't even be here.'

13:44.424 --> 13:47.258
- I wouldn't?
       - Now, hear this.

13:48.995 --> 13:53.331
"One by one, my fellow
     castaways disappeared.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.601
"In spite of my warnings
  that there was danger afoot

13:56.669 --> 14:00.838
"they wandered off only
  to be captured by the enemy.

14:00.907 --> 14:06.044
I found myself all alone
    except for Gilligan."

14:08.047 --> 14:09.380
What's the matter, boy?

14:09.449 --> 14:12.816
Oh, sir, all of our friends
     are captured.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.352
I'm aware of that.

14:14.420 --> 14:17.288
A Japanese sailor
          is going to kill them.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.389
Kill them?

14:18.458 --> 14:22.260
Ha! Not while I have
the use of these two arms.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.062
Oh, sir..

14:26.699 --> 14:28.232
He has guns and things and..

14:28.301 --> 14:30.267
All you have
             is your bare hands.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.903
Gilligan, I order you
to stay here.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.340
I shall go forth
and free our friends

14:35.408 --> 14:37.407
then turn my mind
to the enemy.

14:37.476 --> 14:40.511
- But what if you are captured?
- You shall never know that lad.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.214
For you would hear nothing
but my steady breathing

14:43.283 --> 14:45.182
throughout his tortures.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.317
Oh, sir.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.319
[band music]

14:51.757 --> 14:55.259
- Skipper, we're doomed.
  - Oh, I'm too young to die.

14:55.328 --> 14:59.096
Oh, if I could just see
my darling, Thurston, once more.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.032
Trust me, madam,
to see to it

15:01.101 --> 15:04.502
that you and your husband
are soon reunited.

15:08.875 --> 15:12.543
(Skipper)
Oh! A live hand grenade.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.311
Stand back, ladies.

15:14.380 --> 15:17.681
Sometimes the shrapnel
comes through my fingers

15:17.750 --> 15:19.317
then it goes off.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.919
[boom]

15:22.221 --> 15:25.189
Skipper, what a brave
and dangerous thing you've done.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.193
Now, it's time for
  famous Japanese water torture.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.729
I thought it was the
Chinese water torture.

15:31.798 --> 15:35.533
They copied from Japan.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.336
You know I got a good mind
      not to torture you.

15:39.405 --> 15:43.207
I have many questions to ask
    for you to answer.

15:43.276 --> 15:47.078
Alright now.
                   Drop by drop.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.952
- That's a mighty big blop.
  - I can show you--

15:54.020 --> 15:56.454
No, you don't.
       Not as long as I am alive

15:56.522 --> 15:59.123
you don't even get
          name or serial number.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.292
Skipper, you have come
to save me.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.328
Nothing can save you or him.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.096
Oh!

16:06.165 --> 16:08.433
[speaking Japanese]

16:12.204 --> 16:14.037
[speaking Japanese]

16:14.106 --> 16:16.040
Holy mackerel.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.279
That's not nice.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.682
Oh! Have you got..

16:28.121 --> 16:30.788
And that, Gilligan,
is actually what happened.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.123
It is?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.491
Of course, I have omitted
some of the parts

16:34.560 --> 16:37.695
where I acted far
and above the call of duty.

16:37.763 --> 16:40.498
- But then all officers do.
  - Oh! Yeah.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.933
Now, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble

16:43.002 --> 16:45.035
I have more
that I want to write.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.671
Okay, Skipper.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.407
Uh, Gilligan.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.543
Your bayonet.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.513
No, it's just
I'm a little mixed up.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.783
Not an unusual state,
           I might add.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.519
I was talking to Skipper
about the Japanese sailor

17:01.587 --> 17:03.320
and he remembers
everything different.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.423
Well, fortunately, we don't
     have to depend on memories.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.557
See, I jotted it all down
       in my journal.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.060
Oh!

17:09.127 --> 17:12.597
- You did. What happened to me?
- You were shot.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.366
Oh, no.
          That's the wrong page.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.737
"Menace stalked
         our tiny little island.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.872

"I did the only thing I could

17:25.545 --> 17:28.979
I allowed myself
      to be captured too."

17:29.048 --> 17:31.182
[dramatic music]

17:32.485 --> 17:34.685
Howell, I never thought
he could outwit you.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.488
A ruse. Clever devise
           on my part, my boy.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.623
Getting captured?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.457
Very few men would've
           thought about it.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.793
- How do we escape now?
    - Ha ha ha.

17:42.862 --> 17:46.831
You just leave everything
       to me, huh?

17:56.442 --> 17:59.944
- 'How did you ever do that?'
 - Top secret, my boy.

18:00.013 --> 18:01.312
Top secret.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.449
Keep an eye open,
         I must rescue everyone.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.628
Oh-ho. It's the time
            for execution.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.329
Please, I'm just a young
innocent boy.

18:19.398 --> 18:22.466
Oh, it make no difference.
   It's time for execution.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.136
I'm stalling for time, so one of
my brave friends can rescue me.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.372
Oh, it's one
                  big laugh. Ha!

18:28.441 --> 18:30.174
And a double laugh.
             Ha ha.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.776
[laughing]

18:32.845 --> 18:36.247
Alright now.
Don't move.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.649
[speaking Japanese]

18:39.252 --> 18:41.051
I am saved.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.554
How so?
We see who is saved.

18:43.622 --> 18:47.558
Never fear, Gilligan.
           Thurston is here.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.194
Ooh!

18:51.864 --> 18:54.432
[instrumental music]

18:58.204 --> 18:59.370
Ahoy!

19:05.178 --> 19:07.311
Sir, thank you.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.547
Come. Let us set
                the others free.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.718
No need to worry them, my boy.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.519
I'm sure you
              remember now. Hmm?

19:15.587 --> 19:16.988
You and the Skipper
sure don't agree.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.456
That doesn't matter to me,
      what is important is

19:19.525 --> 19:21.726
I recorded the whole thing
      for posterity.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.294
- Thanks for remembering for me.
- That's alright, Gilligan.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.797
Anytime at all,
        feel free to call on me.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.832
Right.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.738
- Ginger.
           - Yeah!

19:34.807 --> 19:36.507
- Can I bother you for a minute?
- Of course.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.576
You remember when the Japanese
sailor was here on the island?

19:38.644 --> 19:41.679
- The Japanese sailor?
     - Yeah.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.381
- Oh! That's reel 5.
      - You were rescued?

19:44.449 --> 19:47.050
No. No, I rescued you.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.420
Oh, you remember it too.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.624
You see. You were
       tied to a tree

19:53.693 --> 19:56.327
'and I came through the jungle.'

19:56.395 --> 19:57.862
You know, Japanese sailor, sir.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.564
I'm not the only one here
       on the island.

19:59.632 --> 20:03.701
But others are captured too.
So now, I shoot you.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.236
Someone will rescue me
because that's the American way.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.638
I will save you, Gilligan.

20:07.706 --> 20:12.209
Ooh, American movie star
has come for the rescue.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.510
Oh! That's ridiculous.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.447
You think I'm just
        a movie star, don't you?

20:16.516 --> 20:18.849
There's something behind that
greasepaint we don't know about?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.218
I'm Secret Agent 372536.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.288

20:24.357 --> 20:25.756
Oh, mama-san,
       that's no secret?

20:25.825 --> 20:29.426
- I am a Judo expert.
    - And I'm no rookie. Ha!

20:29.495 --> 20:31.929
You Judo expert.
Alright, what's your rank?

20:31.998 --> 20:35.466
- Holder of the black belt.
  - Hurray.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.871

you were great.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.935
Oh, thanks, Gilligan.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.972
I've gotta free the others.
     I shall return.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.675
And after you ran off
into the jungle

21:18.744 --> 21:20.710
how did I get
out of the tree?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.046
I haven't got into
        that part yet, Gilligan.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.115
Come back in an hour,
           I'll have it for you.

21:25.184 --> 21:27.518
Okay, Ginger.
Thanks a lot, Ginger.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.087
Everybody look.
         I found it. I found it.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.356
- What?
      - Gilligan's diary.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.825
It can't be. He threw
     it in the lagoon.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.393
Oh, the tide must've
            washed it back.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.728
What's that miserable wretch
has to say about this?

21:38.797 --> 21:41.765
- I'll hear that too.
  - You better read it, dear.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.734
Alright, listen
            to this, Mr. Howell.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.470
"I'm on the island with
    Mr. Thurston Howell III.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.938
"I don't have to say who he is

21:48.007 --> 21:50.641
"because he's so rich
   that everybody knows him.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.743
"Only, money isn't
       important to him.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.379
"He treats me like
   I'm just as good as he is.

"Which shows what a
    wonderful person he is.

they made up the word 'lady'

- Oh, Gilligan, little buddy.
 - Little buddy?

22:37.190 --> 22:38.688
Whenever has it been
            anything else?

22:38.757 --> 22:40.124
A while ago, you told me--

22:40.192 --> 22:42.659
Skipper, why don't you give
  Gilligan a chair.

22:42.728 --> 22:45.429
Of course, Gilligan,
            Sit down.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.564
Gilligan, my boy I'd..

22:47.633 --> 22:50.767
...like you to accept
my humble apologies.

22:50.836 --> 22:54.071
Oh, well, you're gonna
  apologize to me, Mr. Howell?

22:54.140 --> 22:55.339
Absolutely.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.241
Would you like some
        coconut juice, Gilligan?

22:57.309 --> 23:01.078
Thank you.
         Oh, my diary.

23:01.146 --> 23:05.616
Oh, gee, I'd like to write
   all this down in my diary.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.818
Well, I guess it's just a dream.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.921
- No, don't!
 - Oh, not that one, we won't.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.557
That book must be preserved
at any cost.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.560
- I don't understand.
- What he means, Gilligan, is..

23:49.629 --> 23:51.561
We see ourselves
       as we are, and you see us

23:51.630 --> 23:52.796
'as we would like to be.'

23:52.865 --> 23:54.231
You got me more mixed up now.

23:54.299 --> 23:57.567
Let me try. Gilligan,
what he's trying to say is that

23:57.636 --> 24:00.671
the book means more to us,
than it does to you.

24:00.739 --> 24:03.740
"A Boy Scout's Guide
      Through New Jersey"?

24:03.809 --> 24:05.442
We thought it was your diary.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.145
- Oh, no, I hid that.
     - Good.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.115
And someday, I'll remember
   where I hid it.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.705
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

24:34.774 --> 24:36.239
¶ There here
     for a long long time ¶

24:36.308 --> 24:38.842
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:38.911 --> 24:40.710
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:40.779 --> 24:42.779
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

24:42.848 --> 24:44.915
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:44.984 --> 24:47.351
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

24:47.420 --> 24:49.152
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

24:49.221 --> 24:51.588
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

24:51.657 --> 24:53.690
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

24:53.759 --> 24:55.793
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

24:55.861 --> 24:57.962
¶ As primitive as can be ¶

24:58.030 --> 25:00.330
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:00.399 --> 25:02.232
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:02.301 --> 25:04.735
¶ For seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:04.804 --> 25:07.004
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

25:08.305 --> 25:14.730
