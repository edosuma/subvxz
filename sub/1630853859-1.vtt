00:09.960 --> 00:14.180
Any resemblance
to real persons and events -

00:14.260 --> 00:17.930
is intentional

03:46.890 --> 03:51.140
LIFE AFTER DEATH

03:55.520 --> 03:58.570
You're not going to
take it off already?

03:58.980 --> 04:04.410
I mean, before it's all over.
- It is all over now.

04:05.030 --> 04:10.870
Can't it wait until
after the funeral?

04:12.250 --> 04:17.340
Oh no, they're back there.
The rings, still on her finger.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.510
I'm sure they remove them
for safe keeping.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.800
It must've happened before.
- What?

04:24.890 --> 04:28.600
That they...
someone's forgotten them.

04:29.560 --> 04:34.140
We didn't forget nothing.
You said we'd leave them.

04:34.850 --> 04:38.770
We couldn't take them off
when she was still alive.

04:38.860 --> 04:44.450
No, but they're there
and may be lost forever.

04:44.570 --> 04:50.080
What choice was there? To take them
from her when she was lying there?

04:50.200 --> 04:54.250
Like saying:
"From now on, you're alone."

04:55.250 --> 04:57.840
That's what you are.
- What?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.840
Alone.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.880
Yes, but no one should
be made even more alone.

05:05.510 --> 05:10.350
When the fingers get swollen, you
have to take the rings off by force.

05:10.430 --> 05:14.980
Tearing them off.
- I'm sure they have ways.

05:15.060 --> 05:19.480
Let's call them
and drive there tomorrow.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.400
Tomorrow?
- Yes, to the hospital.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.530
Back to Helsinki? -Yes.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.740
We can't just up and drive there.
We have a lot to do.

05:31.830 --> 05:36.290
The funeral parlor, the grave site.
And the van's damn dirty.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.210
It can't take all day.

05:39.290 --> 05:42.300
Not a moment's rest
until it's all over.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.100
Elsa. -My condolences.

05:59.440 --> 06:05.650
How did you get here?
- Oh Nisse, for your sake, of course.

06:06.490 --> 06:09.950
To be with my little brother
in grief.

06:15.700 --> 06:19.380
But how did you get here
from the station? -I walked.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.880
You could've called,
we would've picked you up.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.050
You're too busy.

06:27.510 --> 06:30.140
I'm used to managing on my own.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.600
How did she know?
- I called her from the hospital.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.380
When are you off to Sweden?

07:07.840 --> 07:13.180
In a couple of weeks. I have to
vacate my apartment before that.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.770
Someone's always been
looking after Nisse.

07:20.690 --> 07:25.650
First, it was our mother
and then yours.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.260
What's that? -A lamp.

07:54.470 --> 07:59.430
Where's the chandelier?
- Hasn't hung there for ages.

08:00.890 --> 08:05.520
Dad's chandelier has been there.
- Not since he died.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.070
And you've asked before,
hundreds of times.

08:12.490 --> 08:17.080
Are you insane? -Don't treat me
like one of your nutty patients.

08:17.160 --> 08:22.330
"Mentally ill" is the word.
I don't work there anymore.

08:22.410 --> 08:25.670
If I survived this year,
I'll survive this.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.750
Don't I know how to mourn?

08:29.050 --> 08:33.550
I took care of Dad when he was ill.
- Never said you didn't.

08:33.630 --> 08:38.100
It wasn't easy, I can tell you that.
- Please, not now.

08:38.470 --> 08:40.930
There you go.

08:43.390 --> 08:48.150
Now that your dad's alone, he thinks
he can behave any way he likes.

08:48.230 --> 08:53.280
Can't I have my feet on the table
in my own home? -Your home.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.320
Think of Stefan, if not me.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.660
You don't get it.
You've only taken care of yourself.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.660
Dad, please.
- Think of Stefan.

09:02.790 --> 09:08.750
He's so decent and still doesn't mind
my odd drinks. Aren't you having any?

09:08.920 --> 09:12.840
So, I'm not decent?
- I never said that!

09:13.130 --> 09:17.090
I do as I please
in my own home. -Stop yelling.

09:17.510 --> 09:21.810
This ain't Helsinki where everything
can be heard. I'd go crazy.

09:21.970 --> 09:27.350
Not everyone can choose
where they live.

09:29.110 --> 09:36.030
If I hadn't taken the house after
Dad, it would be in ruins by now.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.410
Never disputed that. -What would
you do if the boiler broke?

09:41.160 --> 09:44.790
I could call someone. -Right.

09:45.370 --> 09:51.880
Typical of you city folks to think
that you only need to call someone.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.720
Let me tell you, it doesn't work
that way. -When did you ever call?

09:55.800 --> 10:00.430
I came here on my own.
- Always worrying how I'll manage.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.390
Whatever I do,
it's never enough.

10:05.310 --> 10:09.980
I'm going back home,
if you keep yelling.

10:49.390 --> 10:52.520
What are you doing?
- Switch the light off!

10:57.110 --> 10:59.030
Nisse?

11:04.030 --> 11:05.790
Damn beast!

11:37.400 --> 11:39.240
I'm coming, I'm coming.

11:40.110 --> 11:43.160
Damn beast! -Oh, the squirrel.

11:43.410 --> 11:47.240
I'll have to get it before the
birds hatch. -Already breeding?

11:47.330 --> 11:49.250
Just a question of time.

12:12.850 --> 12:19.900
It is available in
spruce, aspen or birch.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.530
Pinewood. That'll be fine, thanks.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.780
Thank you. -Right.

12:26.870 --> 12:32.370
It is available with a finish.
White or black.

12:39.050 --> 12:43.470
Alright, yes, we'll take that.
- Which one?

12:47.470 --> 12:53.310
What which one?
- The finish, white or black?

13:05.070 --> 13:09.410
White. -White. Painted or coated?

13:10.700 --> 13:14.000
Yes, white or black cloth?

13:36.100 --> 13:41.650
We'll be done here
at noon on Saturday.

13:41.730 --> 13:46.700
You'll go through all the details
with the priest on his house call.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.160
House call?

13:50.490 --> 13:53.500
We only want a quick funeral, -

13:53.580 --> 13:57.290
no frills, as soon as possible.

13:57.500 --> 14:02.090
This isn't a long time.
In cities, you wait at least a month.

14:06.550 --> 14:12.060
Two weeks! How can it take so long
to put a person under ground?

14:12.140 --> 14:17.690
I just don't get it.
By then, the whole world will know.

14:18.560 --> 14:23.780
They'll know sooner or later.
- The later the better.

14:24.150 --> 14:29.280
I don't want a lot of strangers
there. Just you and me.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.450
Nisse! -And her, of course.

14:33.870 --> 14:36.620
Telephone!
- And Granny Brita.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.420
This is Nisse.

14:45.550 --> 14:50.050
Yes, the number's the same.
Haven't changed it, you never know.

14:52.010 --> 14:56.980
Yes, that's right.
Oh, so you've heard?

14:58.940 --> 15:02.270
Oh well, we'll see about the date.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.650
We'll be in touch then, I suppose.

15:05.730 --> 15:09.360
Yes, thank you. Bye!

15:10.780 --> 15:14.580
Damn bitch!
- Who was that?

15:15.540 --> 15:19.540
Some cousin of Leila's. I don't know.
- What did she say?

15:19.660 --> 15:22.880
Offered her condolences.

15:24.880 --> 15:29.510
Why are you mad at her?
- Not at her!

15:30.260 --> 15:33.640
At Brita! Your Granny!

15:34.010 --> 15:37.970
Damn, she's spreading
the news to everybody.

15:39.770 --> 15:44.020
How does she even know?
- From Granny, you said so.

15:44.310 --> 15:47.280
Right, but how does she know?

15:51.910 --> 15:57.330
Goddamnit, did you
talk to her, too, already?

15:57.660 --> 16:00.210
Ain't nothing going as planned here.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.540
If she didn't care
when Leila was ill, -

16:03.630 --> 16:06.130
she might as well stay away now.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.090
But she's her mother. -Right.

16:09.170 --> 16:13.260
With Leila gone,
good riddance to her.

16:13.590 --> 16:16.850
It's not true that she didn't care.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.970
Oh, she sure cared.

16:19.060 --> 16:23.850
"I beat cancer by positive thinking"
and "You are as well as you feel".

16:23.940 --> 16:30.360
This shit she brought here!
When Leila was dying!

16:34.110 --> 16:36.490
When did you say it was...?

16:38.870 --> 16:43.370
The viewing.
After the weekend, on Monday.

16:45.290 --> 16:49.300
We have to wait until Monday?
Tomorrow's a workday.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.220
That's the time they gave me.
- Change it.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.180
What? -Yes.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.810
For once, you'd make
a useful phone call.

17:26.620 --> 17:30.840
What did they say?
- Is it okay if I wear this?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.300
What? -To the funeral.

17:33.470 --> 17:36.130
What did they say?
- Yes, sure.

17:36.380 --> 17:40.100
What did they say?
- They'd check and call me later.

17:40.180 --> 17:44.350
Later when?
- Let's just wait.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.940
Wait? We've waited enough.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.610
You call them.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.240
Does it fit?

18:00.490 --> 18:04.870
If you're looking for the coffee,
it's in its usual place.

18:11.800 --> 18:17.880
Not for ages, it hasn't been.
- Yes, I see.

18:19.550 --> 18:23.390
I know I haven't been welcome here.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.390
But I thought it
might be different now.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.310
Bygones! It's in your head
that you weren't welcome.

18:30.400 --> 18:37.530
You didn't get along with Leila,
but that was your fault.

18:40.030 --> 18:44.450
She tried to be nice.
- Yes, yes she was nice.

18:44.990 --> 18:49.670
But I notice
when I'm not welcome.

18:51.380 --> 18:56.340
You're saying that only because
she made this into her and my home.

18:57.300 --> 19:02.010
I'm telling you, don't you go
changing nothing when I'm gone!

19:09.770 --> 19:11.940
Is someone going to answer?

19:18.280 --> 19:20.360
Don't answer it! -Stefan Nurmi.

19:28.120 --> 19:34.590
It is so annoying
with people intruding.

19:35.550 --> 19:39.630
And reminding
you of all that old stuff.

19:40.260 --> 19:44.140
That's why I
thought I'd change things.

19:44.300 --> 19:50.810
To help you forget the old stuff,
leave it behind and move on.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.860
It'll be tomorrow.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.160
The viewing, tomorrow.

20:50.660 --> 20:55.920
I have to admit
that I'm surprised in a good way.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.760
She's absolutely right.
- Granny Brita?

21:01.420 --> 21:06.050
No, Elsa! You have to leave
the old stuff to move on.

21:08.350 --> 21:13.980
We need to get this over with
before she does more damage.

21:14.440 --> 21:20.780
Elsa? -No, Granny Brita!
Before she tells everybody.

21:42.550 --> 21:45.340
Yes, Saturday next week.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.350
What the hell is she doing here?
- Granny.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.560
At twelve o'clock.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.850
Here they come.

21:56.100 --> 22:02.030
It's Stefan and Nisse.
I'll put you on the list.

22:02.860 --> 22:06.490
Yes, I will. Welcome.

22:07.070 --> 22:11.660
Greetings from
Elsi and Bobi, they...

22:13.370 --> 22:17.540
Offer their condolences.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.640
What? A rose? -Yes.

22:39.810 --> 22:42.820
It's supposed to be a carnation.

22:44.610 --> 22:49.740
Is Nisse leaving a rose?
- No, I am.

22:49.820 --> 22:55.790
Is he going to sit there?
Isn't he coming in? -We'll see.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.710
And that one...

23:05.760 --> 23:10.760
That one you must place here, -

23:14.640 --> 23:17.270
where the evil was.

23:22.730 --> 23:26.030
I'm going in now, Granny.
- Yes, yes.

24:42.140 --> 24:43.850
Come on in.

24:52.150 --> 24:53.820
All set here?

26:04.140 --> 26:06.640
So, what did she say?

26:09.020 --> 26:13.900
Your Granny, what did she say?
- Say and say. She was crying.

26:14.650 --> 26:17.200
She must've said something.

26:19.200 --> 26:23.950
She was wondering
why you didn't come in.

26:24.330 --> 26:26.210
Damn!

26:26.710 --> 26:30.380
Interfering with everything.
What's she got to do with it?

26:35.550 --> 26:40.090
What else did she say?
- Well, she cried.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.760
She said...

26:46.810 --> 26:51.650
That the last time she saw mother,
she wanted to hold her, comfort her -

26:51.730 --> 26:53.860
and say everything's alright.

26:54.110 --> 26:59.860
Yeah right, she didn't understand
it was serious, or didn't want to.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.410
I think she understood.

27:02.490 --> 27:06.540
But you could tell right off
how it would end.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.500
I couldn't.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.200
Hello! -Hello!

27:48.870 --> 27:50.920
Here. Some flowers.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.590
Thank you. -Bye!

29:40.440 --> 29:42.110
Listen, listen.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.860
can you hear it?

29:48.910 --> 29:51.870
Only a question of time,
like I said.

29:55.710 --> 30:00.960
So, how did it go?
- Bought a white rose.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.920
And Granny?
- She had a carnation.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.720
A carnation?

30:06.300 --> 30:10.260
Isn't that a little banal?
- Damn banal.

30:10.550 --> 30:13.560
That's what she wanted to have.

30:13.970 --> 30:18.190
It's been ringing off the hook,
but I didn't answer. -Why not?

30:19.020 --> 30:22.730
It's none of my business.
- What's this?

30:23.400 --> 30:26.780
Listen, that's something
I want to talk about.

30:28.990 --> 30:34.080
Leila's clothes. What have I told you
about going through my stuff?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.660
Nissenasse, -

30:37.330 --> 30:40.460
you do have to decide.
Do you want to keep them, -

30:41.130 --> 30:43.460
or move on?

31:08.610 --> 31:10.740
Are those for the funeral?

31:12.950 --> 31:17.160
It needs to be pretty recent,
but these are school photos.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.620
These are awfully lit.

31:20.710 --> 31:24.590
Can't the lighting be softer?

31:25.670 --> 31:30.630
You do understand they are
in a hurry? -You think this is good?

31:32.430 --> 31:35.970
What? It's awful.

31:43.650 --> 31:47.900
She's too young, but the light
is good. -Always, when I shoot.

31:51.990 --> 31:56.830
Not in this one.
- It's just snapshot.

31:56.910 --> 31:59.290
You're only a few hours old there.

32:00.660 --> 32:05.170
Your mom didn't want her picture
taken. She was fussy about her hair.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.590
It had to look good.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.420
Oh, well.

32:13.890 --> 32:19.180
The light's always like this
in the spring. Fall is better.

32:19.270 --> 32:25.690
The light is warmer and it doesn't
shine vertically like in the summer.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.690
You can take good pictures
in the summer, using backlight.

32:31.900 --> 32:37.490
They say a flash is good in
backlight. The faces won't be black.

32:38.410 --> 32:43.790
You think? -They don't turn black
if you know what you're doing.

32:44.080 --> 32:48.000
A flash is the last thing.
- Absolutely. Natural light, always.

32:48.090 --> 32:50.800
Nissenasse!
- Hold on, will you!

32:53.010 --> 32:57.430
There's a lot of photos when
she's young, but then it stops.

33:00.600 --> 33:05.600
The picture is not
only for the funeral.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.610
I want to remember
what she looked like.

33:10.610 --> 33:12.280
Are you coming?

34:40.160 --> 34:42.410
Damn... Stefan!

34:45.750 --> 34:47.830
What's wrong with Nisse?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.830
It's the priest. Want to say hello?

34:50.920 --> 34:54.340
I'd never show myself like this!

34:54.420 --> 34:59.260
Stefan, the priest!
- Isn't he a little early?

35:02.430 --> 35:04.930
Damn early!

35:12.610 --> 35:15.610
Hello. Some more flowers.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.660
See you. -Thank you.

35:23.700 --> 35:28.210
You should've given them back.
- Who are Gunilla and Thorolf?

35:28.410 --> 35:31.330
What are we going to do with those?
Nilla and Rofa?

35:31.920 --> 35:36.300
Are they family?
- Colleagues from school, maybe?

35:36.380 --> 35:39.630
Don't know.
I don't know half of them.

35:40.510 --> 35:42.680
Just put them in water.

35:43.550 --> 35:45.390
Hello.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.020
Are you Nisse? -Yes.

35:52.440 --> 35:56.940
My condolences. -Oh.

35:59.240 --> 36:03.570
One reason for us meeting like
this before the funeral is -

36:03.660 --> 36:07.490
to hear how you'd like
to remember Leila.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.500
What would you like her
to be remembered for?

36:20.090 --> 36:25.260
She... she was a teacher.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.730
A very popular teacher, I'm sure.
- Yes.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.400
Very popular.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.320
She had a way of
drawing people to her.

36:39.860 --> 36:43.660
Until she became sick.
Then she didn't want people around.

36:46.660 --> 36:49.700
Not even her mother,
but she came anyway.

36:49.870 --> 36:54.120
But before,
when she still had some strength, -

36:54.210 --> 36:59.300
people brought her
presents and flowers.

36:59.380 --> 37:04.090
All the time. -Then I guess a lot
of people want to remember her.

37:05.050 --> 37:08.260
Is it going to be a big funeral?
- No, just us.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.850
And a few others.

37:12.810 --> 37:15.730
Next of kin.
- A small funeral, then.

37:15.810 --> 37:18.610
That's how she would've wanted it.

37:19.480 --> 37:26.110
Kind of a last wish.
- Right, a last wish.

37:31.160 --> 37:34.580
Do you think she knew
she wouldn't get better?

37:34.830 --> 37:36.670
Yes. -No.

37:37.500 --> 37:42.130
It was clear. But she didn't talk
about how it would go.

37:42.420 --> 37:46.470
If my end was near, I'd want
him to know about everything.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.810
You don't know how this house
works. What if the boiler fails?

37:52.350 --> 37:55.940
I guess I'll call...
- On Christmas Eve? Who?

37:56.400 --> 37:59.770
What? Santa Claus?
- She might have known.

38:00.400 --> 38:06.360
People don't say much, even if they
fear the worst. Not to worry anyone.

38:13.580 --> 38:16.330
Maybe you were worried anyway?

38:17.920 --> 38:23.010
These aren't ours.
Somebody brought them.

38:24.840 --> 38:29.590
People do seek easy
answers to difficult problems.

38:37.440 --> 38:42.940
But you can't will cancer away.
Same goes for grief.

38:44.610 --> 38:51.870
Grief is like a huge load of sand,
it all has to go.

38:54.410 --> 39:00.000
And you can't use an excavator
and get rid of it all at once.

39:01.670 --> 39:06.630
This needs to go,
one shovel at a time, by hand.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.930
Bye.

39:19.270 --> 39:22.860
"One shovel at a time, by hand."

39:24.900 --> 39:29.910
Are we going to hear
this nonsense at the funeral, too?

39:38.160 --> 39:40.420
Hey!

39:44.710 --> 39:48.760
What's the sudden rush? Can't it wait
until after the funeral?

39:49.130 --> 39:53.470
A lot of talk
about how long it takes.

39:54.260 --> 39:59.940
He may say it takes a year.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.150
But I just had my year.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.570
Thank you very much,
but I'm done mourning!

40:11.700 --> 40:16.790
The last thing I need
is tears and condolences.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Hello Granny.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.710
Well, keeping busy.

40:28.590 --> 40:32.430
Yes. No, it's alright.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.890
Oh, you think so? Well.

40:47.940 --> 40:53.820
She wanted to talk
about the funeral.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.830
I thought we'd serve sandwiches, -

41:01.790 --> 41:07.590
but she's decided on
a sandwich cake. -Sandwich cake?

41:07.670 --> 41:12.720
Leila couldn't stand it!
She'd never serve sandwich cake.

41:13.550 --> 41:18.930
Greasy and messy.
- Yes, a little banal, maybe.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.980
Goddamn banal!

41:22.640 --> 41:26.100
She chose sandwiches
for her fiftieth birthday.

41:26.560 --> 41:32.820
I told Granny that,
but she said they leave you hungry.

41:33.610 --> 41:38.030
She didn't suggest porridge, too,
to fill everybody's belly, then.

41:38.620 --> 41:44.540
Is that the point of a funeral?
To feed people?

41:45.500 --> 41:52.210
What else did she have to say?
- She's invited quite a few.

41:54.380 --> 41:59.800
A small funeral, I said!
- I guess it won't be that.

42:00.720 --> 42:04.890
20, 30 with all the colleagues.

42:06.060 --> 42:08.980
Way past 50 with family.

42:10.440 --> 42:14.650
And then there's Granny's list.
- List?

42:14.820 --> 42:18.280
It keeps getting longer.
- What list?

42:19.450 --> 42:24.290
Why is she inviting people?
It's none of her business!

42:25.710 --> 42:29.420
She'll have to call and cancel.
All of them. Cancel.

42:29.540 --> 42:32.420
Either she arranges this
or we do.

42:32.710 --> 42:37.010
If she invites a single person,
she can arrange the entire funeral, -

42:37.130 --> 42:41.180
porridge, sandwich cake, the works.
I'm not doing nothing.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.230
What? -Nothing.

42:49.480 --> 42:52.690
You weren't with her
all the time. I was.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.160
Nisse! -Do not invite them!

43:07.250 --> 43:10.380
Tell everyone
it's a private funeral.

43:11.710 --> 43:14.050
You be on my side, get it?

43:23.010 --> 43:24.810
Hello?

43:25.470 --> 43:29.600
Hi there. Thank you.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.280
Yes, right...

43:36.780 --> 43:44.410
I'm afraid I'm going
to ask you not to come.

43:50.870 --> 43:56.800
Her wish was
a strictly quiet funeral.

44:08.930 --> 44:15.860
You'll have to take your desk
somewhere else. No room here.

44:17.860 --> 44:21.400
Call the next one
and say the same thing.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.950
Don't give me that look.
Who sent those flowers?

44:31.040 --> 44:35.040
Nilla and Rofa.
- Right, start with them.

44:35.210 --> 44:39.010
What's their last name?
- I don't know.

44:39.340 --> 44:41.550
Then find out!

44:46.050 --> 44:50.140
I mean I don't know
if I can do that.

44:56.940 --> 45:02.360
Oh, but you can keep calling
Granny all the time.

45:03.950 --> 45:07.870
You're the one who started this.
Go on now!

45:09.040 --> 45:11.710
Go! Go, go.

45:54.540 --> 45:59.040
You're not done yet.
Keep at it.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.920
I've tried to humor you.

46:03.550 --> 46:08.640
But forbidding people
to mourn Mom...

46:09.510 --> 46:11.560
I just can't do it.

46:13.930 --> 46:15.940
But you have to.

46:18.270 --> 46:20.060
Bye.

46:23.070 --> 46:26.200
Wait. Hey!

46:27.660 --> 46:30.280
Is this the way you want it?

47:09.660 --> 47:13.450
What are you doing?
- You scared me!

47:14.740 --> 47:17.710
What are you up to?
- You know, -

47:18.000 --> 47:24.050
I haven't slept here
since I was a child.

47:24.460 --> 47:26.210
Or, we were.

47:26.760 --> 47:31.550
You slept there and I...
- It's Stefan's room!

47:32.600 --> 47:38.390
Yes, but he's not here.
- He's coming back.

47:39.060 --> 47:43.730
I wouldn't be so sure. -Of course
he is, at least for the funeral.

47:43.940 --> 47:46.150
That's not what he told me.

47:50.360 --> 47:54.990
He's young, they go back and forth.

48:08.720 --> 48:13.390
I'm here, I'll help you.

48:14.550 --> 48:17.600
Tell me what you want me to do.

48:22.230 --> 48:24.690
How about a cognac? -No.

48:31.450 --> 48:35.370
Would you like me
to call people and cancel?

48:36.030 --> 48:37.910
Do you want me to?

48:38.700 --> 48:40.540
I can call them.

48:44.540 --> 48:50.380
I don't know.
- Just tell me the names.

48:51.760 --> 48:58.220
I mean I don't know who they are,
I don't know them.

48:58.510 --> 49:00.430
But Stefan...

49:02.310 --> 49:05.440
...or Granny Brita would know.

49:08.730 --> 49:12.070
She's the one who invited them all.

51:29.500 --> 51:33.590
You deaf bastard, you're at home?

51:35.670 --> 51:38.970
You're not much
of a guard, are you?

51:39.510 --> 51:44.850
Oh, you old, deaf dog,
where are you going?

51:47.520 --> 51:51.980
What are you doing?
What's that in your hand?

51:52.690 --> 51:55.530
What on earth are you doing here?

51:56.940 --> 52:02.030
What are you doing inviting people
to the funeral without asking me?

52:03.910 --> 52:08.500
Asking you?
It's my daughter's funeral!

52:08.700 --> 52:14.790
Family, friends whom she's known
all of her life... -Don't you start.

52:14.880 --> 52:20.050
...with whom she spent time, but
you don't even know the names of.

52:20.800 --> 52:27.220
They mourn Leila and ask me
why you don't answer their calls.

52:27.890 --> 52:33.480
People she liked and who liked her.
They're in shock!

52:33.980 --> 52:36.520
Because she is no longer...

52:38.440 --> 52:40.440
You could've warned them.

52:41.530 --> 52:47.330
You saw it when you brought your
books like some traveling salesman.

52:47.830 --> 52:51.290
Instead of seeing her!
- What?

52:51.370 --> 52:58.500
You gave her hope when
there was none. None at all!

52:58.670 --> 53:04.260
And what did you do for her?
- I was there.

53:05.140 --> 53:08.970
I was there every day,
saw her getting worse, -

53:09.720 --> 53:16.230
heard her breathing
become heavier, saw her...

53:18.820 --> 53:23.240
Shrinking.
- You shrank her!

53:24.030 --> 53:26.530
You never said a kind word to her.

53:26.620 --> 53:31.410
Just sat there as if you were dead.

53:32.540 --> 53:36.420
At least I did something for her.

53:37.340 --> 53:39.130
You gave her false hope.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.930
I'm taking this.

54:26.380 --> 54:31.430
What are you doing?
- Jesus, are you trying to kill me?

54:31.510 --> 54:33.350
Turn it on.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
So, this is where you are?

55:31.660 --> 55:37.500
I'll get milk for the coffee.
- I take mine black.

55:51.720 --> 55:57.180
Remember when he bought it?
At an auction.

55:58.060 --> 56:00.350
Dad liked auctions.

56:01.190 --> 56:06.820
He was good at bargaining
and getting his way.

56:14.700 --> 56:18.620
You know, I've been thinking.

56:19.960 --> 56:25.090
Now that Stefan's off to Sweden...
- For a while. He'll come back.

56:25.170 --> 56:30.090
He's young,
he might have a change of heart.

56:31.380 --> 56:35.510
I could move in here.

56:35.760 --> 56:40.390
Until you're feeling better,
to begin with.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.810
You'd move in here? -Yes.

56:47.070 --> 56:52.200
What's so strange about that?
- Us living together?

56:52.450 --> 56:59.540
Here, yes. After all,
it is also my house.

57:00.200 --> 57:07.420
You got to live here
because you had a family.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.920
Now that you don't have any, so.
- But I do.

57:11.300 --> 57:15.090
Nissenasse.

57:15.550 --> 57:19.640
We said it's time to move on.

57:19.720 --> 57:23.190
But Stefan... -Him, too!

57:23.690 --> 57:26.690
If he ever comes
back from Sweden, -

57:26.810 --> 57:33.360
it's high time for him
to find something and move on.

57:38.450 --> 57:40.870
I guess the coffee's ready now.

57:58.970 --> 58:03.390
Nisse! What are you doing?

58:03.930 --> 58:07.980
It's my lamp, Leila's and mine.

58:08.060 --> 58:10.650
She chose it,
and it belongs down there.

58:11.570 --> 58:16.110
Nissenasse...
- Don't you Nissenasse me!

58:16.320 --> 58:20.240
I'll put all of it aside
when I feel like it.

58:20.330 --> 58:23.120
We said you're done mourning.

58:23.370 --> 58:26.750
"We"? We haven't
said anything of the sort.

58:27.790 --> 58:30.960
You moving in here.
What would become of that?

58:31.090 --> 58:34.720
We'd be at it like this all day,
I'd go crazy.

58:35.800 --> 58:39.720
Nisse, you're yelling again.

58:39.800 --> 58:42.350
I'm not your patient, I told you!

58:42.430 --> 58:47.730
If you keep doing this...
- You'll leave. Yes, I heard it.

58:49.940 --> 58:55.440
You can call them
and cancel yourself.

59:31.150 --> 59:34.400
Hi, this is Nisse.
<i>- Hi, Nisse.</i>

59:34.780 --> 59:38.360
Leila's Nisse, Finland,
calling about Leila's funeral.

59:38.490 --> 59:42.120
<i>Brita's call brought
the grief to us, too.</i>

59:42.320 --> 59:45.410
Thank you. Right,
Brita told you. Thought so.

59:45.740 --> 59:51.710
But she didn't tell you
that Leila's last wish -

59:51.790 --> 59:58.880
was a quiet funeral.

1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:03.050
Family only.

1:00:03.850 --> 1:00:06.020
Immediate family.

1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:08.600
<i>We weren't planning on coming.</i>

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:12.150
Oh, so you weren't?

1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:18.360
Right, it's a long way, too.
Thanks anyway, bye.

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:31.250
Hi, this is Nisse.
About Leila's funeral...

1:00:31.420 --> 1:00:35.130
<i>What? Has Leila died?</i>

1:00:36.750 --> 1:00:38.760
Yes, yes.

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.970
Hello, I'm calling about
the funeral on Saturday.

1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:49.390
<i>We only know about it
because Brita called.</i>

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:52.770
I'm afraid I'm going to ask you
not to attend.

1:00:52.850 --> 1:00:56.320
<i>Not attend Leila's funeral?</i>
- Yes, it was Leila's wish.

1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:00.320
<i>That I wouldn't attend?</i>
- No, not you precisely.

1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:04.950
No, it's not about you.

1:01:05.030 --> 1:01:07.450
My dear friend,
I didn't mean it like that...

1:01:30.270 --> 1:01:34.810
Elsa, come on, don't be like that.

1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:39.320
Elsa! What's wrong with you?

1:01:40.190 --> 1:01:44.200
Goddamn it, Elsa!
Have you lost it completely now?

1:01:45.110 --> 1:01:49.620
Elsa, get in the van,
so we can talk.

1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:04.590
Get in the van,
so we can talk.

1:02:05.010 --> 1:02:09.100
Where are you going?
I can give you a ride.

1:02:09.930 --> 1:02:14.770
I'll take that in the van, you don't
have to carry it. Give it to me!

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.400
What're you doing with this?
- You've taken enough from me!

1:02:22.110 --> 1:02:26.860
My home, my memories,
but this one, you're not taking!

1:02:27.570 --> 1:02:32.620
Elsa... -Everything I've tried
to do for you... Now it's over.

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:38.830
You'll stand there, the only one in
the family, without me and Stefan.

1:02:43.130 --> 1:02:45.340
You can fix your funeral yourself.

1:02:46.050 --> 1:02:48.510
And don't come to mine!

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.290
Start from there.

1:06:53.090 --> 1:06:55.510
Is that your phone, Stefan?

1:07:42.930 --> 1:07:45.270
Oh, so here you are?

1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:50.690
You're not paying
for this, are you?

1:07:56.070 --> 1:08:00.110
Are your pals coming?

1:08:01.450 --> 1:08:03.160
Or something?

1:08:08.910 --> 1:08:15.500
I've cleared some space at home.
In case you want to take that back.

1:08:16.590 --> 1:08:20.550
Oh, it's this damn big?
- There's room for it here.

1:08:23.930 --> 1:08:28.430
Did you have help carrying it here?
- Was no problem.

1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:34.610
I can stay at their place.
I won't come home before Sweden.

1:08:35.730 --> 1:08:39.440
Of course you're coming home.

1:08:40.570 --> 1:08:43.070
You don't want me there.

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:46.990
You won't let me
or anyone mourn.

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.000
Because you're done mourning,
I get it now.

1:08:55.460 --> 1:09:00.550
You didn't become a widower when
Mom died and you took off the ring.

1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:06.430
Right from the start,
when we heard about the cancer, -

1:09:07.390 --> 1:09:09.600
you isolated yourself.

1:09:11.430 --> 1:09:15.360
You decided she was going to die.

1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:18.280
And you left her alone.

1:09:21.950 --> 1:09:25.700
But I was there every day.
- Not emotionally.

1:09:35.210 --> 1:09:37.500
Because I was afraid.

1:09:39.550 --> 1:09:42.720
Afraid of being left alone.

1:09:43.430 --> 1:09:46.260
You all said she'd recover, but...

1:09:48.430 --> 1:09:50.640
I was there every day.

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:56.770
Afraid of losing her
and being alone.

1:09:59.150 --> 1:10:02.150
Am I going to lose you, too?

1:10:05.780 --> 1:10:10.330
I'll be coming home.
I'm not going to stay in Sweden.

1:10:12.660 --> 1:10:15.040
And before the funeral?

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.670
Do you want me to?

1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:48.070
When did you get these?

1:10:48.740 --> 1:10:51.030
At the viewing.

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.420
Isn't Elsa here?

1:11:41.630 --> 1:11:45.260
She went back home.

1:12:33.090 --> 1:12:35.350
I guess we'll manage...

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:40.600
If we run out of these, we'll serve
Granny's sandwich cake. -Yes.

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:43.730
I bet she'll bring one.
- Two!

1:12:44.940 --> 1:12:48.650
And if that's not enough,
we'll serve... -Porridge!

1:12:55.740 --> 1:12:59.160
She loved lilly-of-the-valley.
- Mom?

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:07.050
I should've told that to the priest
when he asked about her.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:13.260
Didn't come to think of it then.

1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:42.160
This is how it should be.

1:13:45.210 --> 1:13:48.550
Should've been
from the first night.

1:13:54.550 --> 1:14:00.060
Okay, right. Yes.
Yeah, bye.

1:14:13.530 --> 1:14:17.240
Well? -It was Elsa.
She's coming anyway.

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:23.370
We'll have to pick her up
at the station. -No...

1:14:23.580 --> 1:14:27.250
She said can't walk in that dress.

1:14:27.330 --> 1:14:30.880
How the hell are we
going to make it in time?

1:14:38.550 --> 1:14:41.220
Out, out, out.

1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:46.100
If I'm going to make it through
the day, you'll do the driving.

1:15:08.790 --> 1:15:13.170
You sure?
- Don't make a fuss, just drive!
