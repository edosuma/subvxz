00:01.376 --> 00:03.629
To me, the thing about

00:01.376 --> 00:03.629
birthday parties

00:03.629 --> 00:05.464
is that the first and last

00:03.629 --> 00:05.464
party you have

00:05.464 --> 00:07.090
are actually quite similar.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.884
You know, you just

00:07.090 --> 00:08.884
kind of sit there.

00:08.884 --> 00:12.179
You're the least excited

00:08.884 --> 00:12.179
person at the party.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.849
You don't even really realize

00:12.179 --> 00:14.849
that there is a party.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.725
You don't know

00:14.849 --> 00:16.725
what's going on.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.143
Both birthday parties,

00:18.143 --> 00:19.854
people have to help you

00:18.143 --> 00:19.854
blow out the candles.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.188
You can't do it.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.690
You don't even know

00:21.188 --> 00:22.690
why you're doing it.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.734
What is this ritual?

00:22.690 --> 00:25.734
What is going on?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.319
It's also the only two

00:25.734 --> 00:27.319
birthday parties

00:27.319 --> 00:28.904
where other people

00:27.319 --> 00:28.904
have to gather

00:28.904 --> 00:31.699
your friends together for you.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.325
Sometimes they're

00:31.699 --> 00:33.325
not even your friends.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.952
They make the judgment.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.204
They bring them in,

00:34.952 --> 00:37.204
sit 'em down, and they tell you:

00:37.204 --> 00:39.498
"These are your friends.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.082
"Tell them

00:39.498 --> 00:41.082
thank you for coming

00:41.082 --> 00:42.710
to my birthday party."

00:46.045 --> 00:48.883
WOMAN:

00:46.045 --> 00:48.883
These are great!

00:46.045 --> 00:48.883
Just great!

00:48.883 --> 00:49.800
Really great!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.510
Really,

00:49.800 --> 00:51.510
really great!

00:51.510 --> 00:52.928
Don't you think so,

00:51.510 --> 00:52.928
Elaine?

00:52.928 --> 00:54.429
Yeah.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.806
Really great.

00:55.806 --> 00:59.059
Oh, a coffee table book

00:55.806 --> 00:59.059
about coffee tables.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.478
How did you come up

00:59.059 --> 01:01.478
with this idea?

01:01.478 --> 01:03.355
It was there.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.815
Oh, look at this one.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.233
It's saying,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.233
"I'm a coffee table.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.902
"Put some coffee on me.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.153
Oh, the hotter the better.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.153
That's what I'm here for."

01:10.153 --> 01:13.532
Ah, you know, actually, I've

01:10.153 --> 01:13.532
got some work I've gotta do.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.577
How about if the book came

01:13.532 --> 01:16.577
with these little foldout legs

01:16.577 --> 01:18.370
so the book itself

01:16.577 --> 01:18.370
becomes a coffee table.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.373
Oh, that is

01:18.370 --> 01:21.373
a great idea!

01:21.373 --> 01:22.917
Really,

01:21.373 --> 01:22.917
really great!

01:24.376 --> 01:25.627
ELAINE:

01:24.376 --> 01:25.627
"Ohh!

01:25.627 --> 01:27.254
"and that coffee table

01:25.627 --> 01:27.254
is saying,

01:27.254 --> 01:30.131
put some coffee on me!"

01:30.131 --> 01:31.717
I'd like to put

01:30.131 --> 01:31.717
some coffee on her.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.928
Hot, scalding coffee

01:31.717 --> 01:33.928
right in her face.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.471
I swear! This is like

01:33.928 --> 01:36.471
working with a contestant

01:36.471 --> 01:38.139
from<i> The Price Is Right.</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:40.017
[FAKE LAUGHING]

01:41.309 --> 01:43.228
Yeah, that's

01:41.309 --> 01:43.228
real interesting. Elaine...

01:43.228 --> 01:46.440
listen, tell me if

01:43.228 --> 01:46.440
you think this is funny.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.359
"Men definitely hit the remote

01:46.440 --> 01:49.359
more than women.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.736
"Men don't care

01:49.359 --> 01:50.736
what's on TV.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.655
"Men only care

01:50.736 --> 01:53.655
<i>what else</i> is on TV.

01:54.698 --> 01:55.950
"Women wanna see

01:54.698 --> 01:55.950
what the show is

01:55.950 --> 01:57.534
"before they

01:55.950 --> 01:57.534
change the channel

01:57.534 --> 01:58.869
because men hunt

01:57.534 --> 01:58.869
and women nest."

01:58.869 --> 02:00.203
Yeah, it's funny.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.455
I don't know.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.708
You don't know?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.708
Come on. That's gold!

02:04.708 --> 02:07.086
Well, I don't know

02:04.708 --> 02:07.086
about gold.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.295
Oh, that's gold, baby.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.715
Baby? What?

02:09.630 --> 02:11.715
Are you doing George now?

02:11.715 --> 02:14.134
Hey, I was saying "baby"

02:11.715 --> 02:14.134
way before George.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.845
Well, I don't know. Don't ask me

02:14.134 --> 02:16.845
any more questions about jokes.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.889
Jerry, it just puts

02:16.845 --> 02:18.889
too much pressure on me.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.182
This guy Leonard Christian's

02:18.889 --> 02:21.182
gonna be there tomorrow.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.434
Yeah?

02:21.182 --> 02:22.434
Who's he?

02:22.434 --> 02:23.936
A writer from

02:22.434 --> 02:23.936
<i>Entertainment Weekly.</i>

02:23.936 --> 02:25.729
I would like to have

02:23.936 --> 02:25.729
a good show.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.023
<i>Danke schön, </i>

02:25.729 --> 02:28.023
my little dumplings.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.399
Hi.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.484
Hey, how 'bout

02:29.399 --> 02:30.484
that Toby, huh?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.902
Yeah,

02:30.484 --> 02:31.902
how about her?

02:31.902 --> 02:35.697
Ooh, she's a package

02:31.902 --> 02:35.697
full of energy.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.992
Yeah, she's a package

02:35.697 --> 02:37.992
full of something.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.618
And that something

02:37.992 --> 02:39.618
is life.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.203
You gotta meet this gal.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.203
She's brimming with positivity.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.081
Oh, please.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.041
Hey, are you performing

02:44.081 --> 02:46.041
tomorrow?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.167
Yeah.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.167
Great.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.961
I'm gonna bring Toby.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.253
You better laugh.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.588
I'm being reviewed

02:50.253 --> 02:51.588
by Leonard Christian.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.465
She's a great laugher.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.465
Right, Elaine?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.342
Oh, yeah.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.342
She's a great laugher, Jerry.

02:55.342 --> 02:59.346
"Ha-ha!

02:55.342 --> 02:59.346
Really, really great!"

02:59.346 --> 03:00.722
Well, you wanna

02:59.346 --> 03:00.722
sit with George?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.057
He's coming with Robin.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.810
The waitress

03:02.057 --> 03:04.810
from the comedy club?

03:02.057 --> 03:04.810
Yeah.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.854
What about her kid?

03:04.810 --> 03:06.854
Is she bringing him too?

03:06.854 --> 03:07.855
She's got a kid?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.064
Yeah. You should see George

03:09.064 --> 03:10.816
get along with this kid.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.360
GEORGE:

03:10.816 --> 03:13.360
Ow! What are you

03:10.816 --> 03:13.360
doing under there?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.486
Hey, hey, stop that.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.363
Don't eat that.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.363
That's not food!

03:16.363 --> 03:18.115
He's sucking down

03:16.363 --> 03:18.115
Equal packets.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.241
Do you think 25 kids

03:18.115 --> 03:20.241
is too much?

03:20.241 --> 03:23.162
Twenty-five kids

03:20.241 --> 03:23.162
for his birthday party?

03:23.162 --> 03:25.246
Don't put your tongue

03:23.162 --> 03:25.246
on the floor!

03:25.246 --> 03:27.206
He's putting his tongue

03:25.246 --> 03:27.206
on the floor.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.375
Here, here.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.711
Have some more

03:28.375 --> 03:30.711
sugar packets.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.462
So what about

03:30.711 --> 03:32.462
entertainment?

03:32.462 --> 03:33.463
Should I get Barney?

03:33.463 --> 03:34.798
BOY:

03:33.463 --> 03:34.798
No Barney!

03:34.798 --> 03:36.257
Maybe a clown.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.467
How about Bozo?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.469
BOY:

03:37.467 --> 03:39.469
Who's Bozo?

03:39.469 --> 03:40.846
Who's Bozo?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.264
Bozo the Clown.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.264
That's who Bozo is.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.934
When I was a kid, Bozo

03:43.264 --> 03:45.934
the Clown was<i> the</i> clown.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.352
George...

03:47.352 --> 03:49.855
With the orange hair,

03:47.352 --> 03:49.855
the ruffled clown shirt.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.814
George...

03:50.814 --> 03:52.066
A TV show.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.066
Cartoons.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.650
George!

03:53.650 --> 03:55.485
Forget Bozo, George.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.570
Bozo's out.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.612
He's finished.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.990
It's over for Bozo.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.784
When I was a kid, we didn't

03:59.990 --> 04:02.784
have these elaborate parties

04:02.784 --> 04:05.787
with catered food

04:02.784 --> 04:05.787
and entertainment.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.622
I remember my seventh

04:05.787 --> 04:07.622
birthday party.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.666
Blow out the candles!

04:09.666 --> 04:11.710
I said blow out

04:09.666 --> 04:11.710
the damn candles!

04:11.710 --> 04:13.461
Stop it, Frank!

04:11.710 --> 04:13.461
You're killing him!

04:13.461 --> 04:16.006
Blow out the candles!

04:17.424 --> 04:20.427
Well, this time, you can

04:17.424 --> 04:20.427
blow out the candles.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.762
No. I have asthma.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.014
Ow! Ben!

04:21.762 --> 04:24.014
Ben!

04:27.267 --> 04:29.186
Hi.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.687
Hi, Toby.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.772
How are you

04:30.687 --> 04:31.772
doing today?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.314
Fine.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.029
How are you?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.321
Oh, I'm great.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.322
Just great.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.908
Really great.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.578
Oh, hey, did you hear

04:44.367 --> 04:46.578
about Bob Rosen?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.455
No.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.540
He's going to Knopf. He is going

04:48.455 --> 04:50.540
to be a vice president.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.126
Knopf? Really?

04:52.126 --> 04:53.460
Boy...

04:53.460 --> 04:55.545
that means there's

04:53.460 --> 04:55.545
an opening here for...

04:55.545 --> 04:56.755
senior editor.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.133
Has Lippman, uh,

04:56.755 --> 04:59.133
hired anyone?

04:59.133 --> 05:02.219
No. I hear he wants to

04:59.133 --> 05:02.219
promote someone in-house.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.512
Really?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.014
Maybe it'll be you.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.933
Oh, well...

05:07.933 --> 05:09.476
You really deserve it.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.519
Oh, well...

05:11.519 --> 05:13.188
I mean, you have

05:11.519 --> 05:13.188
experience, seniority.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.274
Lippman really

05:13.188 --> 05:15.274
respects your opinion.

05:15.274 --> 05:19.486
Well...

05:19.486 --> 05:21.113
Well, it could be you.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.114
No.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.448
No, really.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.200
Really?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.200
You think so?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.451
Sure.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.079
Boy, wouldn't that

05:26.451 --> 05:29.079
be exciting?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.747
I mean, stranger things

05:29.079 --> 05:30.747
have happened.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.749
Wow! Me, a senior editor!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.542
I'd like that.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.503
You shouldn't

05:34.542 --> 05:36.503
get your hopes up.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.671
Oh, well...

05:37.671 --> 05:39.089
It's a possibility.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.383
Like you said, stranger

05:39.089 --> 05:42.383
things have happened.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.219
Thank you, Elaine.

05:42.383 --> 05:44.219
Thank you.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.003
you stay

11:50.793 --> 11:52.003
close to the ground.

11:52.003 --> 11:52.962
Am I right?

11:52.962 --> 11:54.755
Well...

11:54.755 --> 11:56.508
And when I ran

11:54.755 --> 11:56.508
out that door,

11:56.508 --> 11:59.718
I was not leaving

11:56.508 --> 11:59.718
anyone behind!

11:59.718 --> 12:01.429
Quite the contrary.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.682
I risked my life,

12:03.682 --> 12:06.560
making sure

12:03.682 --> 12:06.560
that exit was clear.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.188
Any other questions?

12:10.188 --> 12:12.899
How do you live

12:10.188 --> 12:12.899
with yourself?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.067
It's not easy.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.406
So, she doesn't wanna

12:17.571 --> 12:19.406
see me anymore.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.579
Did you knock

12:23.201 --> 12:25.579
her over, too,

12:25.579 --> 12:26.996
or just the kids?

12:29.290 --> 12:32.377
No. Her too.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.170
And her mother.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.547
Really? Her mother?

12:35.547 --> 12:36.715
Yeah.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.218
I may have

12:36.715 --> 12:40.218
stepped on her arm too.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.388
You probably couldn't see

12:40.218 --> 12:43.388
because of the smoke.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.763
Yeah.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.765
But it was somebody's arm.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.765
Mmm.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.269
So you feel...

12:49.269 --> 12:51.229
"women and children first"

12:49.269 --> 12:51.229
in this day and age

12:51.229 --> 12:53.314
is somewhat of

12:51.229 --> 12:53.314
an antiquated notion.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.858
To some degree, yeah.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.235
So basically,

12:57.235 --> 12:59.404
it's every man,

12:57.235 --> 12:59.404
woman, child and invalid

12:59.404 --> 13:00.447
for themselves.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.823
In a manner

13:01.615 --> 13:02.823
of speaking.

13:02.823 --> 13:03.950
Yeah.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.826
Well, it's honest.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.161
She should be

13:05.826 --> 13:07.161
commending me

13:07.161 --> 13:09.914
for treating everyone

13:07.161 --> 13:09.914
like equals.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.334
Well, perhaps when she's

13:09.914 --> 13:13.334
released from the burn center,

13:13.334 --> 13:15.086
she'll see things

13:13.334 --> 13:15.086
differently.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.673
Perhaps.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.677
So, what was the fire,

13:20.091 --> 13:22.677
just some greasy hamburgers?

13:22.677 --> 13:24.137
Yeah.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.140
Eric, the clown, put it out

13:24.137 --> 13:27.140
with his big shoe.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.564
By the way,

13:32.853 --> 13:34.564
did you see this?

13:34.564 --> 13:36.608
No, what's that?

13:36.608 --> 13:39.360
The Leonard Christian

13:36.608 --> 13:39.360
article about my show.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
Plus my gig in Miami

13:39.360 --> 13:41.028
got canceled.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.697
I betcha it's because

13:41.028 --> 13:42.697
of the article.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.031
Wow.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.533
He really does

13:44.031 --> 13:45.533
a number on you.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.827
"Seinfeld froze like a deer

13:45.533 --> 13:48.827
in the headlights

13:48.827 --> 13:51.122
in the face of

13:48.827 --> 13:51.122
incessant heckling."

13:51.122 --> 13:54.167
I should've let her have it.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.167
I held back because of Kramer.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.876
You know what you

13:54.167 --> 13:55.876
ought to do?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.836
You should go to her office

13:55.876 --> 13:57.836
and heckle her.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.088
Yeah, right.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.507
Like all the comedians say,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.676
"What if I came to your work

14:00.507 --> 14:02.676
and heckled you?"

14:02.676 --> 14:04.010
Yeah, that'd be something.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.095
I'm not kidding.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.095
You should do it.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.847
But wouldn't that be

14:06.095 --> 14:08.847
the ultimate comedian's revenge?

14:08.847 --> 14:10.600
I've always had a fantasy

14:08.847 --> 14:10.600
about doing that.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.811
Well, go ahead.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.811
Do it.

14:12.811 --> 14:13.852
Why can't I?

14:13.852 --> 14:15.104
No reason.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.232
You know what?

14:15.104 --> 14:18.232
I think I'll do that.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
She came down

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
to where I work.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.319
I'll go down

14:19.567 --> 14:21.319
to where she works.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.196
This is unprecedented.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.489
There's no precedent,

14:23.196 --> 14:24.489
baby.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.285
What, you're using

14:27.534 --> 14:29.285
my "babies" now?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.834
Hey, nice shoes.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.711
What, do you wear

14:35.834 --> 14:37.711
sandals to work?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.086
It's always nice to walk

14:37.711 --> 14:39.086
in a room

14:39.086 --> 14:40.463
and get the aroma of feet.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.632
That's real conducive

14:40.463 --> 14:42.632
to the work atmosphere.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.425
I'm sure your coworkers

14:42.632 --> 14:44.425
appreciate it.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.636
Hey, let's go eat

14:44.425 --> 14:46.636
in Toby's office.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.806
Great idea. We can

14:46.636 --> 14:49.806
check on her bunions.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.100
You know, I have work

14:49.806 --> 14:53.100
to do here. I'm very busy.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.686
Oh, is this

14:53.100 --> 14:54.686
disruptive?

14:54.686 --> 14:57.313
You find it hard to work

14:54.686 --> 14:57.313
with someone interrupting?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.858
Well, how'd you like it

14:57.313 --> 14:59.858
if I called security?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.442
Security!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.695
I don't know how you'll

15:01.442 --> 15:03.695
make it in this business

15:03.695 --> 15:04.779
if you can't take it.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.072
Oh!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.156
You gotta be tough.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.949
Boo! Boo!

15:08.949 --> 15:09.950
You know--

15:09.950 --> 15:11.118
Hiss! Boo!

15:11.118 --> 15:12.245
All right.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.245
That's it.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.830
Get out of my way!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.582
What's going on?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.582
What's happening here?

15:15.582 --> 15:16.583
Toby!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.376
Sss! Boo!

15:18.376 --> 15:20.795
TOBY:

15:18.376 --> 15:20.795
My pinkie toe!

15:20.795 --> 15:22.088
KRAMER:

15:20.795 --> 15:22.088
Toby!

15:22.088 --> 15:23.757
Oh!

15:23.757 --> 15:24.965
Oh!

15:26.760 --> 15:28.762
KRAMER:

15:26.760 --> 15:28.762
What did you go up there

15:26.760 --> 15:28.762
to heckle her for?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.180
Because she came down

15:28.762 --> 15:31.180
to the club and heckled me.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.807
I gave her a taste

15:31.180 --> 15:32.807
of her own medicine.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.853
Oh, yeah! You gave her

15:32.807 --> 15:36.853
a taste of medicine, all right.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.355
Well, I didn't want her

15:36.853 --> 15:39.355
to have an accident.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.732
What accident?

15:40.732 --> 15:42.692
After he heckled Toby,

15:40.732 --> 15:42.692
she got so upset,

15:42.692 --> 15:44.110
she ran out

15:42.692 --> 15:44.110
of the building,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.279
and a street sweeper

15:44.110 --> 15:46.279
ran over her foot

15:46.279 --> 15:47.530
and severed

15:46.279 --> 15:47.530
her pinkie toe.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.408
That's

15:48.782 --> 15:50.408
unbelievable!

15:50.408 --> 15:51.992
Yeah. Then after

15:50.408 --> 15:51.992
the ambulance left,

15:51.992 --> 15:54.036
I found the toe.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.372
So I put it in a Cracker Jack

15:54.036 --> 15:56.372
box, filled it with ice

15:56.372 --> 15:57.874
and took off

15:56.372 --> 15:57.874
for the hospital.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.125
You ran?

15:59.125 --> 16:01.168
No. I jumped

15:59.125 --> 16:01.168
on the bus.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.713
I told the driver, "I got a toe

16:01.168 --> 16:03.713
here, buddy. Step on it."

16:05.005 --> 16:06.006
Holy cow!

16:06.006 --> 16:07.007
Yeah, yeah.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.468
Then, all of a sudden,

16:08.468 --> 16:11.178
this guy pulls out a gun.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.890
Well, I knew any delay's

16:11.178 --> 16:13.890
gonna cost her her pinkie toe,

16:13.890 --> 16:17.017
So I got out of the seat

16:13.890 --> 16:17.017
and started walking towards him.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.271
He says, "Where do you think

16:17.017 --> 16:20.271
you're going, Cracker Jack?"

16:20.271 --> 16:22.857
And I says, "Well, I got

16:20.271 --> 16:22.857
a prize for you, buddy"

16:22.857 --> 16:24.776
Plah! Plah! Keeyah!

16:25.735 --> 16:27.069
Knocked him

16:25.735 --> 16:27.069
out cold.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.571
How could you

16:27.069 --> 16:28.571
do that?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.906
Yeah, then everybody

16:28.571 --> 16:29.906
is screaming

16:29.906 --> 16:31.365
because the driver,

16:29.906 --> 16:31.365
he's passed out

16:31.365 --> 16:32.784
because of all

16:31.365 --> 16:32.784
the commotion.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.453
The bus is

16:32.784 --> 16:35.453
out of control!

16:37.246 --> 16:39.499
So I grab him by the collar.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.499
I take him out of the seat.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.335
I get behind the wheel.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.335
Now I'm driving the bus.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.004
You're Batman.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.923
Yeah. Yeah.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.923
I am Batman.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.341
Then the mugger,

16:46.923 --> 16:48.341
he comes to,

16:48.341 --> 16:49.926
and he starts

16:48.341 --> 16:49.926
choking me,

16:49.926 --> 16:52.011
So I'm fighting him off

16:49.926 --> 16:52.011
with one hand,

16:52.011 --> 16:55.055
and I kept driving the bus

16:52.011 --> 16:55.055
with the other, ya know?

16:55.055 --> 16:56.808
Then I managed

16:55.055 --> 16:56.808
to open up the door,

16:56.808 --> 16:59.101
and I kicked him out

16:56.808 --> 16:59.101
the door with my foot

16:59.101 --> 17:00.561
at the next stop.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.689
You kept making

17:00.561 --> 17:02.689
all the stops?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.363
Well, people kept

17:08.486 --> 17:10.363
ringing the bell!

17:13.783 --> 17:15.869
Well, what

17:13.783 --> 17:15.869
about the toe?

17:15.869 --> 17:17.077
What happened

17:15.869 --> 17:17.077
to the toe?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.288
Well, I am happy to say

17:19.288 --> 17:21.791
the little guy's back in place

17:19.288 --> 17:21.791
at the end of the line.

17:24.418 --> 17:28.047
You did all this

17:24.418 --> 17:28.047
for a pinkie toe?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.424
Well, it's a

17:28.047 --> 17:30.424
valuable appendage.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.305
So Kramer

17:34.512 --> 17:36.305
found the toe,

17:36.305 --> 17:38.307
and they

17:36.305 --> 17:38.307
reattached it.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.893
Really?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.436
Yeah. Poor kid.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.436
What an ordeal.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.981
Right. And you know how

17:42.436 --> 17:44.981
extremely sensitive she is.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.691
She's gonna need

17:44.981 --> 17:46.691
our full support.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.317
Yeah, right.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.402
Look who's here!

17:49.402 --> 17:51.362
Toby.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.362
Hey, it's Toby.

17:51.362 --> 17:54.114
WOMAN:

17:51.362 --> 17:54.114
How are you?

17:51.362 --> 17:54.114
How are you feeling?

17:54.114 --> 17:55.742
Oh, I'll be okay.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.826
WOMAN:

17:55.742 --> 17:56.826
Are you sure?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.160
I think so.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.872
Toby, what can I do?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.872
Can I get you something?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.790
Oh, no. No, thank you.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.709
Toby, please let us help.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.709
We're family.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.795
Oh, well, I could

18:04.709 --> 18:07.795
use a cup of coffee.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.339
JERRY:

18:08.796 --> 18:10.339
She got the promotion?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.841
Yep.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.842
Why?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.052
I'll tell you why.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.221
Because of her pinkie toe.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.221
That's why.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.057
Because Lippman felt

18:17.221 --> 18:19.057
so sorry for her,

18:19.057 --> 18:21.100
he didn't wanna

18:19.057 --> 18:21.100
hurt her feelings.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.309
Too bad.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.311
Sure, the pinkie toe

18:22.309 --> 18:24.311
is cute,

18:24.311 --> 18:26.022
but I mean,

18:24.311 --> 18:26.022
what is it?

18:26.022 --> 18:28.775
It's useless.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.775
It does nothing.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.819
It's got that little nail

18:28.775 --> 18:31.819
that's just impossible to cut.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.904
What do we need it for?

18:32.904 --> 18:34.238
Because that's the one

18:32.904 --> 18:34.238
that goes

18:34.238 --> 18:35.782
"wee wee wee"

18:34.238 --> 18:35.782
all the way home.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.158
You just shut the--

18:38.158 --> 18:39.869
Hey, Elaine.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.869
Did you hear the good news?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.079
Toby got promoted.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.538
Yes, I heard,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.538
Kramer.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.582
I work there,

18:42.538 --> 18:44.582
remember?

18:44.582 --> 18:45.959
Yeah, and you know

18:44.582 --> 18:45.959
what she told me?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.668
She said her first

18:45.959 --> 18:47.668
order of business

18:47.668 --> 18:49.629
is to put my coffee table book

18:47.668 --> 18:49.629
into the bookstores

18:49.629 --> 18:51.422
as soon as possible.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.299
Oh, wonderful!

18:53.299 --> 18:56.510
You know, throughout this whole

18:53.299 --> 18:56.510
thing, she always kept smiling.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.013
Of course. She's deranged.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.850
I went down

19:01.474 --> 19:02.850
to the magazine.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.644
I pleaded with him

19:02.850 --> 19:04.644
to come see me again.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.563
He's coming tonight

19:04.644 --> 19:07.563
and writing another article.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.941
I heard you went down

19:07.563 --> 19:09.941
to somebody's office

19:09.941 --> 19:11.358
and heckled them?

19:11.358 --> 19:14.194
Damn right. We've been

19:11.358 --> 19:14.194
lap dogs long enough.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.781
How could you do that?

19:14.194 --> 19:16.781
Everybody's talking about it.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.199
It's about time one of us

19:16.781 --> 19:19.199
drew a line in the sand.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.451
Jerry,

19:20.451 --> 19:21.995
you're like Rosa Parks.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.082
You opened the door

19:23.871 --> 19:26.082
for all of us.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.208
I can't wait till the next time

19:26.082 --> 19:28.208
somebody heckles me.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.169
Yeah, well,

19:28.208 --> 19:30.169
it won't be long.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.713
ANNOUNCER:

19:30.169 --> 19:32.713
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.713
please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!

19:36.467 --> 19:37.844
Robin? Robin!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.930
George, what is it?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.930
I'm working.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.098
Robin, listen to me.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.058
The most amazing

19:42.098 --> 19:44.058
thing has happened.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.978
Kramer has

19:44.058 --> 19:46.978
opened my eyes.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.395
I think

19:46.978 --> 19:48.395
I've changed.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.440
What are you

19:49.522 --> 19:51.440
talking about?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.440
Okay.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.776
I mean, Bozo the Clown.

19:53.776 --> 19:57.363
I mean, does he really need

19:53.776 --> 19:57.363
"the Clown" in his title

19:57.363 --> 19:59.740
as clown.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.740
Bozo the Clown?

19:59.740 --> 20:03.369
Are we gonna confuse him

19:59.740 --> 20:03.369
with Bozo the district attorney?

20:03.369 --> 20:06.413
Bozo the pope?

20:03.369 --> 20:06.413
There's no other Bozo.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.791
You'll see. Things

20:06.413 --> 20:08.791
will be different now

20:08.791 --> 20:12.003
if you'll just give me

20:08.791 --> 20:12.003
one more chance.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.922
L-listen, I-I gotta

20:12.003 --> 20:14.922
think about this.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.550
All right, but I'm

20:14.922 --> 20:17.550
serious about this.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.844
All right.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.844
Hand it over, man!

20:21.387 --> 20:23.597
That's why men hunt

20:21.387 --> 20:23.597
and women nest.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.932
GEORGE:

20:23.597 --> 20:24.932
He's got a gun!

20:24.932 --> 20:27.393
He's got a gun!

20:24.932 --> 20:27.393
Get out of the way!

20:27.393 --> 20:29.562
[SCREAMING]

20:35.359 --> 20:37.653
George!

20:35.359 --> 20:37.653
[SCREAMING]

20:37.653 --> 20:40.406
This is Ronnie Kaye!

20:40.406 --> 20:41.741
The prop comic?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.161
Oh, hi. I--

20:45.161 --> 20:46.453
I didn't

20:45.161 --> 20:46.453
recognize you.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.539
What, did you...

20:46.453 --> 20:48.539
You get a haircut?

20:48.539 --> 20:49.707
Nostrils.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.669
George,

20:53.669 --> 20:54.921
could I have a word?

20:54.921 --> 20:56.964
[♪♪♪]

21:04.638 --> 21:06.140
I was in a hotel the other day,

21:06.140 --> 21:08.559
and they have that fire map

21:06.140 --> 21:08.559
on the back of the door.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.728
I'm flattered they think

21:08.559 --> 21:10.728
I have it together enough

21:10.728 --> 21:13.272
to stand in a burning hotel

21:10.728 --> 21:13.272
room memorizing directions.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.941
"Hey, I'll go left

21:13.272 --> 21:14.941
by the stair,

21:14.941 --> 21:17.484
right by the candy machine."

21:17.484 --> 21:19.445
I'd probably get lost,

21:17.484 --> 21:19.445
have to go back to the room,

21:19.445 --> 21:20.821
check the map again.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.784
And they always tell you,

21:22.573 --> 21:24.784
no matter what you do,

21:24.784 --> 21:27.578
in a hotel fire,

21:24.784 --> 21:27.578
do not panic.

21:27.578 --> 21:28.996
Hey, I've got

21:27.578 --> 21:28.996
four minutes to live.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.623
I've never panicked

21:28.996 --> 21:30.623
in my whole life.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.000
It's my option.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.377
Even if they find you,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.377
you have a perfect excuse.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.089
"Gee, I heard they saved you

21:35.377 --> 21:38.089
swinging from the shower curtain

21:38.089 --> 21:40.424
naked with the ice bucket

21:38.089 --> 21:40.424
on your head. What happened?"

21:40.424 --> 21:41.717
"Well, I panicked."

21:41.717 --> 21:43.385
"That's understandable."
