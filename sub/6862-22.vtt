WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.204
What you did is the worst thing
anyone ever did to me.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.672
And I don't want to
be a big person about it

00:04.705 --> 00:05.739
and just let my anger go.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.641
I just want to make sure
that your anger towards men

00:07.675 --> 00:10.244
doesn't cause you to tell people
things that you shouldn't.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.379
I'm here to tell you
I'm pretty sure

00:11.412 --> 00:13.147
that you are
the one for me, and...

00:13.181 --> 00:15.449
Are you out of your freakin'
mind right now?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.318
As long as we're in BlueBell,
she'll be around.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.320
Are you seriously
asking me to...

00:19.353 --> 00:20.621
to leave BlueBell?

00:20.654 --> 00:21.689
I've had a very hard night.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.057
And I feel terrible.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.192
So, for a while,

00:24.225 --> 00:26.160
I'd like to feel better.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.768
(birds chirping)

00:44.845 --> 00:46.046
(snoring)

00:48.716 --> 00:50.718
Mm. Good morning, Doc.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.420
You ready to go again?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.622
(screams)

00:54.655 --> 00:55.656
(gasps)

00:57.191 --> 00:59.360
(sighs, laughs)

01:00.894 --> 01:01.862
(sighs with relief)

01:01.895 --> 01:03.664
(laughs)

01:03.697 --> 01:05.866
(toilet flushes)

01:05.899 --> 01:07.301
No, no.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.603
(whispering):
No, please don't let it be...

01:09.637 --> 01:10.804
(gasps)

01:10.838 --> 01:12.573
What a night,
what a night.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.276
Okay, this could be a dream...

01:15.309 --> 01:16.277
within a dream.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.511
Wake up, sister!

01:17.545 --> 01:19.147
Wake up!

01:19.180 --> 01:20.181
Still here.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.315
No, this didn't happen.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.483
How could you let this happen?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.717
I was not in my right mind
last night.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.619
Oh, I know.
Want to go again?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.723
WADE: (chuckles)
Hey, Tucker.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.724
(gasps)

01:30.758 --> 01:32.726
No! No, no! This is...

01:32.760 --> 01:33.727
this is unbelievable.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.729
This is freakin' unbelievable.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.599
George! George, wait, wait,
let me explain!

01:38.632 --> 01:40.234
(groans)

01:40.268 --> 01:42.470
That guy really has
terrible timing.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.571
(groans)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.173
Hmm?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.640
(groans)

01:46.674 --> 01:49.210
(car horn honks)

01:49.243 --> 01:51.345
(seagulls calling)

01:51.379 --> 01:53.481
(birds singing)

01:58.919 --> 02:00.354
(whistling)

02:00.388 --> 02:01.922
AnnaBeth, you look
radiant this morning.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.624
Mwah!

02:03.657 --> 02:05.726
Right back at you, Wade.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.395
Why the long face, Lavon?

02:07.428 --> 02:08.429
It is a beautiful day.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.630
Well, I'm worried.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.830
Burt Reynolds hasn't eaten any

02:10.864 --> 02:12.433
of his hamburgers
the whole week.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.901
Hasn't even touched
his crinkle fries.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.569
What if something happened
to him?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.704
Sweetie, isn't it
mating season?

02:16.737 --> 02:19.307
I mean, animals do kooky things
during mating season.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.808
Maybe Burt's on the prowl.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.177
Love is in the air.
(chuckles)

02:23.211 --> 02:24.712
Doctor.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.214
Shut up!

02:26.247 --> 02:28.249
Burt's missing.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.384
I wouldn't worry.
It is alligator mating season.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.485
Now, how does everybody
know that?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.554
No, no, it's not like Burt

02:33.587 --> 02:35.423
to just wander off
and mate.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.357
He has discipline.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.260
Don't judge.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.396
You know, sometimes people--
alligators-- do crazy things.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.566
You know, it doesn't
mean anything, though. Nope.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.901
Oh, no.
You didn't?

02:47.935 --> 02:48.602
Wade?

02:48.636 --> 02:50.238
I don't want to talk about it!

02:50.271 --> 02:52.273
Got to go.
Busy day.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
Mating season.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.679
LEMON:
 Right there is just fine.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.814
That's great.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.216
Hey, Lemon.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.551
It is so crowded today.

03:03.584 --> 03:04.952
Business must be good.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.387
Ooh, mackerel!

03:06.420 --> 03:07.488
Uh-huh. What do you need?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.722
Well, since Daddy's away

03:08.756 --> 03:10.558
on another
of his romantic getaways,

03:10.591 --> 03:11.559
you're in charge.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.960
I read online

03:12.993 --> 03:15.529
that Gloriana is playing
a secret show in Birmingham.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.565
Please? Please?!
Magnolia Breeland,

03:17.598 --> 03:20.568
I know for a fact that you have
a history paper due on Monday,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
and you haven't even
opened up a book.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.504
Yeah, well, I get all
the history lessons I need

03:23.537 --> 03:24.638
by looking at your wardrobe.

03:24.672 --> 03:25.939
Is it too much to ask

03:25.973 --> 03:27.575
for a little excitement
once in a while?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.743
(sighs)
ANNABETH:
Hi, Lemon. Psst!

03:32.346 --> 03:33.681
(whispers):
All right...

03:35.716 --> 03:37.918
And here's our
esteemed leader now!

03:37.951 --> 03:39.920
Hello, ladies.
Sorry I'm late.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.590
As you have been for every
Belle meeting this month.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.325
Because of her new business!

03:44.358 --> 03:45.859
And we are all so
proud of you, Lemon.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.961
Right, Crickett?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.297
Of course we are.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.464
It just seems like

03:50.498 --> 03:51.465
your job

03:51.499 --> 03:53.401
as roadhouse proprietress
has taken you away

03:53.434 --> 03:55.536
from some
of your Belle duties.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.273
Perhaps we should elect
an interim leader?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.942
Just until you can give us
some more of your time.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.911
Of course.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.346
If you feel
that someone else

04:05.379 --> 04:06.747
should fill in, then,
I won't hold you back.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.881
I nominate AnnaBeth Nass.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.883
No, no, not me.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.051
Very busy.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.821
Take me off that list!
Off that list!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.756
Well, then,
I nominate Crickett.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.391
Me?!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.560
Wow. I accept.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.894
(laughter, mild applause)

04:21.928 --> 04:23.364
Oh.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.633
Thank you for
stepping up, Crickett.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.800
Now I should get back to work.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.369
I'm very busy. So busy.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.838
Yes, unpacking fish
for your roadhouse.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.507
It's not a roadhouse.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.042
See, under my management,

04:35.075 --> 04:37.445
the Rammer Jammer
is an up-and-coming destination

04:37.478 --> 04:38.846
for the country music scene.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.382
Seriously?
The Rammer Jammer?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.684
Yes, it just so happens that...

04:43.717 --> 04:48.389
Gloriana is playing a secret
show here this Saturday, so...

04:48.422 --> 04:49.990
Oh!
I do like that Gloriana.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.929
Oh, Gloriana?
That's amazing.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.531
It is!

04:57.565 --> 05:00.934
Do you, by any chance,
know where I can find them?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.070
Hey, Wanda, have you, uh,
seen George Tucker?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.339
Well, I'd imagine
he's having a bad day.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.574
Tansy left last night.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.543
What? Tansy left?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.679
Like left-George-Tucker left?

05:11.712 --> 05:14.047
Since she threw his underwear
out of her trailer window

05:14.081 --> 05:16.717
while she drove away--
I'd say that's a good bet.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.419
You know, I wonder

05:18.452 --> 05:20.554
if the big breakup
had anything to do

05:20.588 --> 05:23.056
with Tansy knowing about you
declaring your love to him.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.660
Jonah, when, when, when are you
going to leave this town?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.429
Oh, admit it.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.697
(grunts)

05:30.798 --> 05:33.100
Our first order of business--

05:33.133 --> 05:35.403
I would like a gavel.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.704
Probably pink.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.739
(gasps)
Or a disco ball.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.774
Write that down.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.610
(knocking on door)

05:45.613 --> 05:47.748
Uh, Mayor Gainey,

05:47.781 --> 05:50.584
uh, to what do I
owe the pleasure?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.019
Here I come
to bury the hatchet.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.556
And they say a good big cookie
can smooth anything over.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.926
A good big cookie like the kind
you can buy at the mall?

06:00.861 --> 06:04.998
Uh, it's always been hard
for me to resist a giant cookie.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.166
(laughs)

06:06.199 --> 06:09.136
But I'm never gonna give in
on the mall.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.838
Oh. Well, that...

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
that is, that is
disappointing.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.108
Guess, I'll, uh,
see you later...

06:15.142 --> 06:17.144
alligator.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.513
(Gainey snickers)

06:19.547 --> 06:21.515
Alligator?

06:21.549 --> 06:24.518
What-what's that supposed
to mean?!

06:25.553 --> 06:28.388
*

06:33.827 --> 06:35.796
George?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.798
I had no idea

06:37.831 --> 06:39.567
that you and Tansy...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.001
I'm sorry.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.170
My life has completely
fallen apart, thanks to you,

06:43.203 --> 06:44.805
so, you'll have to forgive me

06:44.838 --> 06:46.540
if I don't really feel like
chatting right now.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.909
Okay, okay, but George,

06:48.942 --> 06:51.679
I just... I want you to know
what you saw this morning--

06:51.712 --> 06:54.648
it isn't what you
thought you saw.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.051
Okay, may-maybe it is, but
it did not mean anything.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.553
Well, I don't care.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.925
Well, why did you come
to see me today?

07:04.958 --> 07:07.561
I had a splinter.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.963
Well-well,
it was pretty early,

07:09.997 --> 07:12.065
and I do have
office hours for...

07:12.099 --> 07:16.737
Yeah, well, sometimes you need
a splinter removed, okay?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.972
But after what I saw
this morning,

07:19.006 --> 07:21.975
I will just go ahead and hold on
to that splinter forever,

07:22.009 --> 07:25.613
as a reminder to never
get involved with you again.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.480
God, don't say that.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.616
George, you know how
I feel about you.

07:28.649 --> 07:32.553
No, I know how you say
you feel about me, Zoe,

07:32.586 --> 07:35.889
but you had a chance to be
with me, and you chose...

07:35.923 --> 07:38.492
you chose someone else.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.728
That is not true, George.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.063
We have never even been
on a date, Zoe, all right?

07:43.096 --> 07:47.000
So this-- us-- is a fantasy

07:47.034 --> 07:50.003
that we have just clung to,
but it's not reality.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.105
Because in reality,
the person that you...

07:52.139 --> 07:56.610
truly have feelings for is Wade.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.612
Wade?!

07:58.646 --> 08:00.614
No. That is crazy!

08:00.648 --> 08:03.116
I saw it when the two of you
were together,

08:03.150 --> 08:05.118
and I saw it again
this morning.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.256
So, if you will excuse me,

08:09.289 --> 08:11.625
I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.602
ANNABETH:
 "See you later, alligator,"

08:21.635 --> 08:23.604
is a common saying.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.172
No, no.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.007
Clearly, Gainey was
letting me know

08:27.040 --> 08:28.809
that he's holding
my alligator hostage

08:28.842 --> 08:30.611
until we give in
on his infernal mall.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.546
You're jumping to conclusions.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.582
You know, I went
to the Dixie Stop last night.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.017
They were out of rump roast.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.284
You want to know why?

08:38.318 --> 08:40.854
'Cause they made a huge delivery
to Gainey's house in Fillmore.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.890
Maybe he was making a stew!

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
Okay, I'll admit,
it sounds suspicious.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.262
I need... to assemble
an elite team

08:49.296 --> 08:52.032
of townspeople who can help me
get my gator back.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.433
(laughing):
Yeah!

08:53.466 --> 08:58.071
Uh, one-- there are no elite
groups of anything in BlueBell.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.340
The closest you'll
find is ragtag.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.576
And two-- please,
please don't!

09:02.610 --> 09:04.177
(knocking on door)

09:04.211 --> 09:05.813
Mmm...
(speaking gibberish)

09:05.846 --> 09:07.648
(mutters)
Mmm.
Hi!

09:07.681 --> 09:10.918
You do realize
you are in my bedroom?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.352
I'm entertaining!

09:12.385 --> 09:13.721
I really need you guys.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.055
(scoffs)

09:15.088 --> 09:16.323
Oh... okay.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.859
So, I went
to tell George

09:18.892 --> 09:20.794
that there is nothing
going on with me and Wade.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.195
But he said
that it's actually Wade

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
that I'm hung up on and not him.

09:23.931 --> 09:24.898
But that's not true, right?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.367
'Cause wanting George means
that I am over Wade,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.337
and I can't go back to not
being over Wade because...

09:30.370 --> 09:32.205
he really hurt me,
and that sucked.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.340
You guys agree, right?

09:33.373 --> 09:34.474
I'm not still
hung up on Wade.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.077
I basically told George that
I loved him the other night.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.345
You did what now?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.713
Lavon, get with
the program.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.815
Everyone knows this.
It's why Tansy left.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.083
What? Tansy left?!

09:43.116 --> 09:44.985
My life is not
in good shape at all!

09:45.018 --> 09:46.887
No! Not good!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.089
Zoe, the only way you're gonna
gain some perspective

09:49.122 --> 09:51.725
on this debacle is
to step away from it.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.662
You know, why don't you go
to that wedding in New York

09:54.695 --> 09:56.229
you've been trying
to get out of?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.198
You know, take the weekend,
clear your head.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.733
It was gonna be hard enough

09:59.767 --> 10:01.702
being the weird doctor
that moved to Alabama

10:01.735 --> 10:03.370
at a wedding with all
my New York doctor friends.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.705
But what makes it unbearable

10:04.738 --> 10:07.007
is the thought
of being that weird doctor

10:07.040 --> 10:09.109
at the single table.
That was bad advice!
A.B., you're up.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.678
I don't know, but Zoe,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.713
if you wanted to feel
better last night,

10:12.746 --> 10:14.782
there are many things
you could have done.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.117
Personally, I love
to eat crullers, but...

10:17.150 --> 10:18.719
you chose to
sleep with Wade.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.922
So, the question is: why?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.992
I don't know!

10:25.025 --> 10:26.994
(grunts in frustration)

10:27.027 --> 10:29.863
You know, I am very disappointed
in both of you.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.932
I expected so much more.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.967
(door shuts)

10:34.001 --> 10:36.970
That is a lot of crazy
for one morning around here.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.706
She is nuts!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.774
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to Fillmore

10:40.808 --> 10:42.810
and look
for alligator tracks.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.013
LEMON:
 Okay, can you please

10:46.046 --> 10:47.180
have them call me back today?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.249
It is extremely,
extremely urgent.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.018
This is Lemon Breeland.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.286
B-R-E-E-land.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.022
Okay, thank you.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.257
Lemon, I just saw posters up
at the Dixie Stop.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.391
Is Gloriana
coming tomorrow?

10:58.425 --> 11:01.028
Posters? There are posters?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.330
I mean, yeah.
(scoffs) They're coming.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.065
You can thank me, buddy!

11:05.098 --> 11:07.334
Nice one, Breeland. Yeah, baby.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.169
(chuckles nervously)

11:17.010 --> 11:17.711
Tell me, with
Little Miss Tansy

11:18.979 --> 11:20.948
trailering out of town,

11:20.981 --> 11:23.116
does this mean
the long-awaited debut of Zeorge

11:23.150 --> 11:24.251
is about to happen?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.119
Say who?

11:26.153 --> 11:27.120
Zeorge.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.155
Zeorge?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.256
Zeorge.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.825
Zeorge. Like...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.360
Zoe and George?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.095
"Goe" with a "G"
was just too confusing.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.297
No, Dash, no.
There's no Zeorge, okay?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.832
And this... It...

11:38.866 --> 11:40.734
This is ridiculous.
I'm out of here.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.102
But...

11:43.270 --> 11:45.205
Well, does this mean
that there's still hope

11:45.238 --> 11:47.340
for the Zade fans out there?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.777
No comment.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.814
Nobody wants to
talk these days.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.885
This cannot be good for me.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.490
Hey, Doc.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.860
That can't be good
for me either.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.228
What are you doing? Get out.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.497
I brought beer.
I thought we could hang.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.800
No. You thought that I might
get naked with you again.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.067
Yeah, I was open
to that possibility.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.403
Can't say we didn't have
a good time last night.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.005
I could tell that you did.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.539
(chuckles)

12:19.572 --> 12:21.541
No! No!

12:21.574 --> 12:25.145
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.079
Where are we going?

12:26.113 --> 12:28.081
Not we, me. New York.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.450
I got to get out of here.
You know, that singles table

12:30.483 --> 12:31.985
suddenly just seems
so much more appealing.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.522
I don't think I understand.
I am not getting involved
with you again, Wade.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.390
Because you hurt me.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.426
And look at you!
You haven't even changed!

12:39.459 --> 12:41.962
Not one little bit!
Get out!
Why are you doing this? Hey...

12:53.073 --> 12:54.541
Lemon.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.143
There you are.
Great news.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.577
After sending muffin baskets

12:57.610 --> 12:59.279
and bouquets of
flowers and homemade

12:59.312 --> 13:01.148
fried chicken to Gloriana's
hotel in Birmingham,

13:01.181 --> 13:02.816
they finally agreed
to a meeting.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.750
No way! Really?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.853
I may have implied
that the Rammer Jammer

13:05.886 --> 13:08.221
is a 700-seat venue
with air conditioning.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.190
Well, a meeting-- that's great!

13:10.223 --> 13:11.124
(chuckles)

13:12.192 --> 13:16.329
Honey, I have seen you charm
your way into and out of

13:16.363 --> 13:18.031
so many, many things,
but it might be

13:18.065 --> 13:21.034
a good idea to bring someone
with you who knows something--

13:21.068 --> 13:22.502
anything-- about music.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.536
Like who?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.241
Oh, I can't.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.877
Wade hates shenanigans.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.012
So do I. And never once
has that stopped you

13:32.045 --> 13:33.881
from asking me
to be your wacky sidekick.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.351
Oh, Wade...

13:44.124 --> 13:47.827
(muffled music
playing over earbuds)

13:48.661 --> 13:51.131
Oatmeal square?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.234
Oh, no, thanks.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.036
No nuts. I'm allergic.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.470
Hope you didn't
bring nuts--

13:57.504 --> 13:59.873
just the smell of 'em
and boom, I'm dead.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.408
Well, I didn't bring
a snack at all, so...

14:01.441 --> 14:03.076
New York City.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.544
I've never been.

14:04.577 --> 14:08.081
I can tell by your shoes,
you are a Big Apple-er.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.483
What will you be up to?
Oh, I'm just in for the weekend.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.352
I have a wedding.
(gasps)
Wedding.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.486
Fun.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.621
Where's your date?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.890
I'm going solo.
Who knows?

14:16.924 --> 14:19.226
Maybe I will meet someone
amazing at the singles table.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.894
You're single?

14:20.928 --> 14:23.363
Yeah.
I'm a compulsive gambler

14:23.396 --> 14:26.333
with a foot odor problem,
and I've been married 12 years.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.968
What's wrong with you?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.038
It's kind of a long story.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.052
Hey, George!

14:45.085 --> 14:46.386
I need legal help.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.388
Yeah, I'm sorry, Lily Anne.
But as the sign says,

14:48.421 --> 14:50.490
I am off to imbibe
large amounts of alcohol.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.960
But I'm leaving for tour
tomorrow and some politician

14:52.993 --> 14:54.962
is using one of my songs
without my permission.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.396
Can you give me
ten minutes, please?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.698
As long as I can drink
while I advise,

14:58.731 --> 15:01.001
I'm good with it.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.206
LAVON:
Thank you for coming.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.407
All right, each of you are here

15:07.440 --> 15:08.942
because you bring something
to this mission.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.410
You're here for your ingenuity,

15:10.443 --> 15:12.946
your-your love of reptiles,

15:12.980 --> 15:15.348
your availability...
but more importantly,

15:15.382 --> 15:17.584
your contempt
for our neighbors to the north.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.420
Right. I hate you,
but I hate Fillmore more.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.722
Exactly! Here's the situation.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.092
Now, Gainey is holding
my Burt Reynolds hostage--

15:25.125 --> 15:26.493
probably in his barn--
and what we need

15:26.526 --> 15:28.295
is a plan to break him out.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.698
I got enough weapons
in my storeroom for all of us.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.301
I say we storm in,
armed and ready.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.169
We take something
that belongs to Gainey

15:36.203 --> 15:37.437
and arrange a trade.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.505
Like his wife.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.506
When everyone's asleep

15:39.539 --> 15:42.175
we come in through the chimney
like Santa does.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.544
We pretend we're making
a movie in Fillmore.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.180
We give everyone a script,
a new identity.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.483
Then we location scout
on Gainey's property.

15:50.517 --> 15:53.053
We put on a play.
You can be Peter Pan,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.722
Gainey can be Captain Hook,
I can be Wendy

15:55.755 --> 15:58.625
and Burt can play the crocodile.
(chuckles)

16:00.627 --> 16:03.396
Sorry, I got confused
about the assignment.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.165
While all those
are fine ideas,

16:05.198 --> 16:08.068
uh, I'm looking for something
a little less ragtag.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.102
ANNABETH:
Lavon.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.141
What's going on in here?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.543
Just a normal town meeting.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.011
Didn't you get the Evite?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.346
Right.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.747
Of course.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.716
Elite team.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.652
Mm-hmm.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.256
We need to think bigger.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.124
You want bigger,
well, listen up.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.126
I show Ocean's Eleven
every Tuesday

16:33.160 --> 16:34.627
over at the senior center.

16:35.628 --> 16:36.729
They forget what happens.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.065
Oh.
Oh.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.033
What do you got?
You tell Mayor Gainey

16:40.067 --> 16:42.569
that you are reconsidering
the mall project.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.572
You'd like to have lunch
with him and his wife

16:45.605 --> 16:47.574
at Fancie's to
talk it over.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.611
Tom Long will act as valet.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.517
He will find the barn key,
 give it to you

16:57.550 --> 17:00.320
and you head over to Gainey's
 and... voila.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
(chuckles)

17:02.355 --> 17:05.058
Come on, people.
We got a alligator to save.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.162
WADE:
 Are you kidding?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.164
The town's covered in posters
and Gloriana's not booked?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.300
It is a mere technicality.
You know, I thought

17:13.333 --> 17:14.800
that you would be more
excited about this.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.270
What is going on
with you?

17:17.304 --> 17:18.671
Oh. I get it.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.540
You think that we should
book your band.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.840
Definitely not the one
with Meatball,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.576
but I'd consider the one
with George Tucker.

17:23.609 --> 17:24.711
(snorts)

17:24.743 --> 17:26.113
Oh.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.515
This is about George Tucker.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.151
Because he broke up
with Tansy,

17:31.184 --> 17:33.186
and now you think Zeorge
is inevitable?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.556
No? You don't?
Well, why not?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
He's finally single,
she's single.
Why wouldn't they?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.861
(gasps)
Oh... my... God.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.730
You slept with Zoe Hart!

17:44.731 --> 17:47.634
Who are you?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.803
You told that lawyer
you had feelings for him,

17:50.837 --> 17:52.439
even though he had
a girlfriend?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.141
I haven't really been
in my right mind

17:54.174 --> 17:57.110
ever since my bartender
neighbor cheated on me.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.278
You mean the guy you slept with?

17:58.311 --> 18:00.347
I thought we were back to
doing the casual sex thing,

18:00.380 --> 18:01.848
which is why I showed
up at her door...

18:01.881 --> 18:03.583
With a six-pack of beer.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.784
Can you believe it?

18:04.817 --> 18:06.119
You thought that
that would work?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.154
What were you thinking?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.222
Well, I agree with the lawyer.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.192
It's the hot neighbor
you're into.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.793
Are you still in love with her?
Are you still in love with him?

18:13.826 --> 18:14.461
No.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.829
No.
Well, thank goodness.

18:16.863 --> 18:17.797
(sighs)

18:17.830 --> 18:19.632
Can you please pull over again?
I have to pee.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.468
And then,
for the love of God,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.404
can we agree not to talk
about Zoe Hart anymore?

18:24.437 --> 18:25.405
Oh, I agree.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.406
No more talking.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.840
No more.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.376
I am just gonna
read my book.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.878
Because I could use
some peace and quiet

18:31.911 --> 18:33.713
to decompress, you know?

18:33.746 --> 18:34.781
Excuse me.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.518
(music playing indistinctly)

18:38.551 --> 18:40.553
(sighs)

18:41.921 --> 18:43.156
PILOT (over P.A.): Uh, this is
your captain speaking.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.426
I'm sorry to disturb you, folks,
but we have a situation here.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.127
Is there a doctor onboard?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.597
Yeah, uh,
I'm a doctor.
Yes.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.135
(sighs)

18:59.406 --> 19:01.374
It's nice but odd running
into you here, Dr. Hart.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.244
Well, I've been having
an odd few days.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.946
Not as odd as him apparently.
Doctors. Thank God.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.648
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.384
WOMAN: A few days ago, he was
in a motorcycle accident,

19:11.418 --> 19:13.386
but the hospital
said he was fine to fly.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.921
ZOE:
And he was feeling
okay this morning?
Yes,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.489
but a few minutes ago,
he started having trouble

19:16.523 --> 19:19.726
breathing-- um, we thought
it was his asthma.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.665
Ma'am, your husband's suffering
from a tension pneumothorax.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.799
The trauma caused
a bubble of air

19:26.833 --> 19:28.535
in his chest which is causing
him breathing problems.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.403
He needs a needle
thoracostomy to relieve

19:30.437 --> 19:31.538
the air pressure
in his lungs.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.806
I need you guys to gather
any medical gear you have

19:33.840 --> 19:36.243
and tell the pilot to prepare
for an emergency landing.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.277
Can I see his medication?

19:46.453 --> 19:49.689
How can you possibly pee
this many times in an hour?

19:49.722 --> 19:52.559
Women have smaller bladders
than men--- it's a proven fact.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.527
It's to compensate
for their larger brains.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.896
You are killing me, lady.
Seriously killing me.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.935
Wade, I am sorry that
the amazing Dr. Zoe High Heels

20:02.969 --> 20:04.337
gave you the brush-off,

20:04.371 --> 20:06.339
but I've reached my limit
of that sulky face.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.308
You need to snap out of it!
We have a meeting with Gloriana

20:08.341 --> 20:10.710
in 30 minutes, and we need to
practice what we're gonna say.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.012
Well, after "please,"
I got nothing.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.781
(starts engine)
Put your seat belt on.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.853
The engine's too loud.
I can't get a conclusive read.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.591
I'm gonna have to cut.
Jonah, if you're
wrong, he'll die.

20:31.898 --> 20:32.865
Stop.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.302
What?
His lips are blue.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.837
Yeah, you're right.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.440
If he had tension pneumothorax,
his lips would be white.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.874
He's hypoxemic.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.476
Ma'am, it's not his heart,

20:43.510 --> 20:44.544
it's his lungs.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.978
He needs epinephrine.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.750
Yo, nut allergy.
You got an EpiPen?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.819
Uh-huh.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.657
Uh... okay.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.692
(sighs, groans)

20:59.726 --> 21:01.428
This'll keep his lungs open
until we land.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.664
(sighs)

21:04.697 --> 21:06.933
Well, it should.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.039
(inhales loudly)

21:13.072 --> 21:14.907
RACHEL:
Doug. Oh.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.776
He's breathing.
He's breathing.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.579
He's breathing.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.914
Thank you so much. (cries)

21:21.948 --> 21:24.384
Nice work, Doctor.

21:32.425 --> 21:35.728
"In closing, if you don't
immediately cease and desist

21:35.762 --> 21:37.630
"the use of Miss
Lonergan's songs,

21:37.664 --> 21:39.699
"we will be forced
to sue for damages.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.402
Sincerely Yours,
George Tucker, Esquire."

21:42.435 --> 21:45.705
Boom. Little sloshed,
but I think it'll work.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.440
Thank you so much.
No problem.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.442
Now, what can I do for you?

21:49.476 --> 21:52.612
Nothing. Nah, I'm a rat in
a maze, looking for cheese,

21:52.645 --> 21:54.714
but there is no
cheese... only pain.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.816
Aha! You're heartbroken!

21:56.849 --> 22:00.620
Heartbreak is my area
of expertise.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.455
Talk to Lily Anne, GT.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.492
Well, there is
this girl-- Zoe.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.093
Zoe Hart? I love her!
Yeah?

22:07.126 --> 22:08.327
I called off
my wedding for her.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.498
Then I found out I was too late
'cause she slept with Wade.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.865
Oh, you got to run from Wade.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.134
Yeah. And then I met Tansy,
and that was awesome.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.836
But guess who
messed that up, too.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.771
Yeah, and then,
to top it all off,

22:18.805 --> 22:20.707
where do I find myself
the other morning?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.775
At guess whose house!
Why, you ask?

22:22.809 --> 22:23.776
That's a great question.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.111
I don't even know the answer!

22:25.144 --> 22:26.846
Now I find myself
missing Tansy's dog.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.948
And I was never even
a dog person.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.984
Well, luckily,
the solution is simple.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.986
Write a song about your pain.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.590
It works for Taylor Swift,
Adele and me.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.126
No. I don't want to
think about my pain.

22:40.159 --> 22:45.031
If I could just drink Zoe Hart
off my mind, I'll be all better.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.033
(laughing):
Holy cow!

22:47.066 --> 22:48.868
Zoe Hart's on TV!

22:48.901 --> 22:50.870
MAN (on TV):
...take you down to the airport.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.605
ZOE:
It was no big deal really. I...

22:52.639 --> 22:55.742
I am a medical professional,
and I took an oath to treat,

22:55.775 --> 22:57.877
to heal.
(applause in restaurant)

22:57.910 --> 23:00.480
REPORTER:
The young and beautiful doctor
was able to diagnose

23:00.513 --> 23:01.814
and stabilize the patient,
allowing for...

23:01.848 --> 23:03.049
Yeah, let's write that song.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.784
REPORTER:
She's a true Alabama hero.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.492
He's half an hour late.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.193
Oh, it's a classic
war tactic--

23:14.226 --> 23:16.796
trying to keep us on
edge till he arrives.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.632
(phone line ringing)

23:19.666 --> 23:21.200
Yeah?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.735
MAYFAIR:
Big Papa, this is the Shepherd.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.870
Who?

23:23.903 --> 23:24.804
Reverend Mayfair!

23:24.837 --> 23:27.206
Captain Hook is right
where we want him.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.541
Captain?!

23:28.575 --> 23:29.676
Seriously? Have you never seen

23:29.709 --> 23:30.610
an Ocean's movie?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.645
Sorry. Yeah, yeah.
Uh, good work, Shepherd.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.514
Uh, okay, now,
we're at the location.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.782
Call me if Gainey leaves.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.750
Roger that, Big Papa.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.620
Big Papa?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.933
All right, everyone set?

23:53.966 --> 23:55.868
Yeah.
I brought sandwiches.
Who wants peanut butter?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.103
Who wants tuna fish?

23:57.136 --> 23:58.505
(overlapping chatter)
Hey, whoa!

23:58.538 --> 24:00.540
Guys, we're here to
rescue an alligator,

24:00.573 --> 24:02.542
not have a picnic.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.777
Did anyone bring
anything actually useful?

24:04.811 --> 24:06.646
I got my night vision goggles,
binoculars,

24:06.679 --> 24:08.648
a tent in case
we need to bunk out,

24:08.681 --> 24:11.217
bug spray, and I got
a bayonet.
(gasps)
Whoa!

24:11.250 --> 24:12.151
Just kidding.
It's an umbrella.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.521
Weather man said rain.
(indistinct chatter)

24:14.554 --> 24:16.022
Now, we find Burt,
and we head out.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.657
We ain't got
time to waste.
Right.

24:17.690 --> 24:18.758
Break.
Roger that.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.529
(groaning)

24:26.599 --> 24:27.867
(door creaks open)

24:29.569 --> 24:31.671
Burt?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.772
Hey, buddy!

24:32.805 --> 24:33.806
Lavon Hayes is here.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.241
All right, we're gonna
get you out.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.510
(gasps)
Oh, my gosh!

24:37.544 --> 24:38.277
Look how cute!

24:38.310 --> 24:39.679
Burt has a girlfriend.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.013
FRANK:
A girlfriend

24:41.047 --> 24:42.081
that snacks on

24:42.114 --> 24:43.883
human appendages.
I can't die!

24:43.916 --> 24:44.851
I can't die! I'm a newlywed.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.085
(hissing)

24:46.118 --> 24:48.755
Oh, God.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.256
Okay, everybody calm down.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.759
I told you we should have gone
with the fake film crew plan!

24:52.792 --> 24:55.828
Big Papa's gonna
figure this out.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.597
LEMON:
And

24:57.630 --> 25:00.733
in conclusion, not only would
this be an incredible honor

25:00.767 --> 25:02.902
and a favor, but we also think

25:02.935 --> 25:05.237
that you would have
a great time.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.106
So, what do you think?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.542
It's fine.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.010
Fine? Wait! Come on!

25:11.043 --> 25:13.012
Get your mind off
of Zoe Hart!

25:13.045 --> 25:14.614
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.082
I'm... yeah, I'm sorry.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.651
Yeah, I never should
have gone over there

25:18.685 --> 25:21.153
with a six-pack expecting...

25:21.187 --> 25:24.023
Zoe was right-- I'm the same
old dummy I've always been.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.925
(sighing)
Okay, you know what?

25:25.958 --> 25:27.594
This is really the last thing

25:27.627 --> 25:29.896
that I want to talk
about right now, but

25:29.929 --> 25:31.263
consider this.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.166
When you first met Zoe Hart,
you worked in a bar.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.703
And now, you own a bar.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.238
Since your dalliance, how
many women have you slept with?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.907
None.
Exactly.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.309
The old Wade would have bedded
every able-bodied girl

25:43.342 --> 25:44.310
in a ten-mile radius.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.646
Also, here you are,
talking about your feelings,

25:46.679 --> 25:49.048
which I'm pretty sure
the old Wade wouldn't have done.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.784
You acted like a ding-dong
last night,

25:51.818 --> 25:54.186
but that was an anomaly,
because the truth is,

25:54.220 --> 25:56.055
is that you have changed,

25:56.088 --> 25:59.091
because being with Zoe Hart
made you better.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.662
Just as you made her better.

26:02.695 --> 26:03.796
Malted milk ball?

26:03.830 --> 26:07.066
(phone ringing)

26:07.099 --> 26:08.067
CRICKETT: Lemon!
Aah!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.201
Great news!

26:09.235 --> 26:10.937
The Junior League used
the phone tree,

26:10.970 --> 26:12.972
and everyone's coming
to see Gloriana.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.675
Oh, and Zoe Hart was on TV!

26:15.708 --> 26:17.276
Zoe Hart was on TV?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.111
She saved a guy on a plane.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.213
They had to make
an emergency landing in Quinby.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.682
Isn't that exciting?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.083
(engine revving)

26:24.116 --> 26:27.119
(tires squealing)
Wade!

26:27.153 --> 26:29.288
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!
Quinby's only 20
minutes away, Lemon.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.624
And you were right.
Look, I have changed.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.125
Which is why
I'm going after her.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.861
Now?! You want to do this now?!

26:34.894 --> 26:36.863
We are going to miss
our meeting with Gloriana!

26:36.896 --> 26:38.330
Do you not hear
the exclamation points

26:38.364 --> 26:39.832
at the end of my sentences?!

26:39.866 --> 26:40.833
Yeah, baby!

26:43.970 --> 26:45.171
Your rental
car's all set.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.372
Thanks.

26:46.405 --> 26:47.840
Oh, my gosh.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.676
You're that doctor
from the TV!

26:49.709 --> 26:53.212
Wow! You looked so much
taller on the big screen.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.281
For you, a
free key chain.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.084
Thank you.
I earned it.
JONAH:
So, am I gonna have to hear

26:58.117 --> 27:00.753
about how you saved that guy's
life for the next two hours?

27:00.787 --> 27:03.122
Oh, don't forget the flight
from Atlanta to New York City.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.190
I've calculated six.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.192
Well, I have to admit--
it was pretty impressive.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.261
That adrenaline, that rush--
it's exactly what I needed.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.131
Yeah, your life in BlueBell
is practically a telenovela.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.735
Mi vida amorosa
 es un desastre.
Oh.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.169
You know what I think?

27:17.203 --> 27:21.708
No, because A: I don't have ESP,
and B: I don't care.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.876
I think you need more time
away from BlueBell

27:23.910 --> 27:25.011
than just a weekend.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.345
What?

27:26.378 --> 27:27.847
Stay in New York
for the summer.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.216
Brick will happily
cover for you.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.785
I mean, you've certainly done
enough to satisfy your old chief

27:32.819 --> 27:34.787
by now.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.956
Call him, set up
an elective rotation,

27:36.989 --> 27:39.759
sharpen your surgical skills and
escape from your soap opera.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.995
I don't know.

27:43.029 --> 27:46.933
Well, we have five hours and
58 minutes to talk it over.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.400
(engine revs)

27:48.434 --> 27:50.937
What do you mean,
you can't find my car?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.171
I-I don't know
what happened, sir.

27:52.204 --> 27:55.041
I mean, I-I looked in town
square, and then, I looked near

27:55.074 --> 27:56.308
town square, and
I guess I kind of

27:56.342 --> 27:58.745
forgot where I put it.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.179
It's definitely my bad.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.315
Well, I'm going
to go find the manager!

28:03.349 --> 28:05.785
Why on earth is Mayor
Gainey so upset?

28:05.818 --> 28:08.120
And more importantly, when
did Fancie's get a valet?

28:08.154 --> 28:11.423
Yeah, I... Interesting
questions, both of them.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.892
Just talked to Big Papa.
They got Burt,

28:12.925 --> 28:14.961
but they're trapped
by another alligator...

28:14.994 --> 28:16.996
Hey... AnnaBeth.
How you been?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.430
How-how's your mom?

28:18.464 --> 28:21.768
Something you want
to confess, Reverend?

28:21.801 --> 28:23.770
Uh...

28:23.803 --> 28:25.704
Mm, mm...

28:27.840 --> 28:29.108
Good luck.
Thank you so much.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.043
Hey, great news.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.979
She remembers Zoe, says
they're on their way to Atlanta.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.180
Come on,
let's go.
No.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.048
I'm sorry. Did you say, "No?"

28:36.082 --> 28:37.349
I'm using simple phrases

28:37.383 --> 28:38.818
because that's how you
speak to mental patients.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.486
Wade, I am all for
grand gestures,

28:40.519 --> 28:41.720
but Zoe is not here.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.023
We will never, ever find her
in some rental car on the road.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.357
We need to focus on
what we can control,

28:45.391 --> 28:46.492
which is getting a famous band

28:46.525 --> 28:47.960
to play at our
rinky-dink roadhouse.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.962
(sighs)

28:49.996 --> 28:53.499
Wade... we need this, okay?

28:53.532 --> 28:56.002
We are so, so close.
I can feel it.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.838
You're right, mm-hmm.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.272
What can I say?
You're right.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.540
Thank you.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.375
Sure, all right.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.411
(sighs)

29:06.578 --> 29:08.547
(both sigh)

29:08.580 --> 29:11.017
We're not going
to Birmingham, are we?

29:11.050 --> 29:12.518
No. (clears throat)

29:12.551 --> 29:14.053
(engine revving)

29:14.086 --> 29:16.923
Wow. Four napkins full
of lyrics.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.424
LILY ANNE:
Not bad.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.392
Now there's only one thing
left to do.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.061
You need
to sing your song tonight.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.295
(laughing)

29:23.329 --> 29:25.231
Yeah. No, that's
not gonna happen.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.466
However, I do feel
better, so for that,

29:27.499 --> 29:30.169
I...

29:30.202 --> 29:32.038
I'll get us another drink.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.841
You got it.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.142
Chester?
(clears throat)

29:36.175 --> 29:37.543
I need, uh... I need three...

29:37.576 --> 29:40.312
I mean, one pitcher
of beer and three napkins.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.282
Hello, BlueBell!

29:43.315 --> 29:45.317
Will you please
welcome to the stage

29:45.351 --> 29:47.286
your very own
Mr. George Tucker!

29:47.319 --> 29:49.388
(applause and cheering)
Do it!

29:49.421 --> 29:51.290
MAN:
Yeah.
(whooping)

29:51.323 --> 29:53.159
CROWD (chanting):
Tucker! Tucker!

29:53.192 --> 29:55.094
Tucker! Tucker!

29:55.127 --> 29:57.196
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

29:57.229 --> 29:58.530
Tucker! Tucker!

29:58.564 --> 30:00.466
Tucker! Tucker! Tucker!

30:00.499 --> 30:02.401
All right, all right,
all right.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.903
(applause and cheering)

30:03.936 --> 30:05.171
MAN:
Yeah!

30:05.204 --> 30:07.339
(whistling)

30:07.373 --> 30:09.608
* If she never came to town

30:09.641 --> 30:12.311
* Then she never
would have found me *

30:12.344 --> 30:14.881
* Drivin' on the side
of the road *

30:14.914 --> 30:18.951
* When I gave her a ride
and she sat down inside *

30:18.985 --> 30:22.621
* I didn't know things were
about to explode *

30:22.654 --> 30:26.258
BOTH (in harmony):
* Gonna sail my boat
far away from heartache *

30:26.292 --> 30:28.460
* Gonna sail it
away from rain *

30:28.494 --> 30:31.230
* 'Cause I was once
man of the year *

30:31.263 --> 30:33.265
* But today
I'm drinking beer *

30:33.299 --> 30:34.600
* You say you're a doctor

30:34.633 --> 30:36.535
* Why'd you bring me
so much pain? *

30:36.568 --> 30:38.470
* But you say
you're a doctor *

30:38.504 --> 30:41.340
* Why'd you bring
me so much pain? *

30:41.373 --> 30:43.109
(song ends)

30:43.142 --> 30:46.012
(applause and cheering)

30:46.045 --> 30:48.881
(sighs)
We can't just stay here.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.083
If Gainey gets back,
we'll all go to prison.

30:51.117 --> 30:53.385
Conjugal visits will be way
too much pressure for Tom.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.087
I have a plan.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.322
Alligators are fast,

30:56.355 --> 30:58.624
but they can't turn their heads
very well.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.492
So when we run out of here,
everyone

31:00.526 --> 31:03.095
do a zigzag motion.
On my count...

31:03.129 --> 31:05.031
Uh, thanks, Frank.
I'll take it from here.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.598
Oh, and also,
they're afraid of cats.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.167
So if you see a cat

31:08.200 --> 31:09.435
while you're
zig-zagging,

31:09.468 --> 31:11.570
you throw the cat
at the alligator.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.972
Just to be safe.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.506
Okay. Anybody got
any other ideas?

31:14.540 --> 31:17.409
That don't involve Argo.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.577
You know what? We wouldn't be

31:18.610 --> 31:21.113
in this mess if Ruby was mayor.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.648
I'm just saying
what everybody's thinking.

31:22.681 --> 31:23.649
So it's all my fault?

31:23.682 --> 31:25.451
Yes. Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

31:25.484 --> 31:26.352
(whispering):
Quiet! Quiet!

31:26.385 --> 31:28.154
I hear something.
(vehicle approaching)

31:29.288 --> 31:31.523
It's a truck.
It's coming closer!

31:31.557 --> 31:33.325
(horn honking "Dixie")
It's Gainey!

31:33.359 --> 31:35.394
Hold on. No, no, no.
I-I'd know that honk anywhere.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.896
We're saved!

31:42.634 --> 31:43.535
Come on, everybody! Get in!

31:46.638 --> 31:48.607
Come on! I leave no man behind!

31:48.640 --> 31:51.477
You know, you might just be
crazier than me.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.679
Oh, the bar is high,
my friend. Now get in the truck.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.315
Let's go.
Mount up!

32:07.759 --> 32:10.462
No one should have
to pee this much.
Shh.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.731
We'll never catch 'em
at this rate unless
I hitch a Porta Potty

32:12.764 --> 32:14.600
up to the back of my car.
Shh!

32:14.633 --> 32:17.336
Yes, I-I realize that we missed
the meeting with Gloriana,

32:17.369 --> 32:20.439
but maybe you could ask them
to please reconsider.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.441
Listen, I don't know

32:22.474 --> 32:26.178
if-if Gloriana ever needed
just one victory,

32:26.212 --> 32:28.514
just one win
to turn things around

32:28.547 --> 32:30.316
for themselves, and as someone
that needs exactly that,

32:30.349 --> 32:33.619
I'm asking them
to please, please reconsider.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.456
Yes, I understand.

32:37.489 --> 32:39.491
Thank you for hearing me out.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
(sighs)

32:41.527 --> 32:42.761
You know what? I will never

32:42.794 --> 32:44.130
forgive you for ruining
our business

32:44.163 --> 32:46.332
over this wild goose chase.
MAN:
Lemon?

32:46.365 --> 32:48.600
Jonah? What are
you doing here?

32:48.634 --> 32:50.702
Uh, long story.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.538
You want some pie?

32:52.571 --> 32:55.074
Oh, thank heavens you are here.
I have been in a horror movie

32:55.107 --> 32:57.976
that never ends and keeps
spawning sequels.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.414
LEMON:
Oh, my...

33:02.448 --> 33:04.350
Uh, hey, Doc.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.253
Wade. Lemon.

33:09.121 --> 33:10.222
If you guys need to use
the restroom,

33:10.256 --> 33:11.257
they are out of towels.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.071
What's going on
with those two?

33:25.104 --> 33:26.538
(sighs)
I don't know.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.374
Wade's gonna declare
his love or something.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.641
(groans)

33:29.675 --> 33:31.210
Interesting.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.679
How do you think
that's gonna go?

33:34.713 --> 33:36.448
Oh, no!

33:36.482 --> 33:38.217
Not you, too!

33:38.250 --> 33:39.685
Jonah Breeland,
you better promise me

33:39.718 --> 33:41.587
that you are not
in love with Zoe Hart!

33:41.620 --> 33:43.655
Of course not. I don't...
I don't do love.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.060
But I-I can't say the tiny
doctor doesn't intrigue me.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.095
(sighs heavily)

33:55.567 --> 33:57.536
Well, I'm sorry
about last night.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.771
I was acting
like my old self.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.374
You came all this way
just to tell me that?

34:02.408 --> 34:03.809
(both laugh anxiously)

34:03.842 --> 34:07.646
I came all this way
to tell you that...

34:07.679 --> 34:09.648
you saw more in me

34:09.681 --> 34:13.784
than I... ever saw
in myself.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.788
And I was scared I couldn't
live up to that image.

34:16.822 --> 34:20.126
It was easier just to...
wreck it all.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.592
Which I did.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.596
(sighs)

34:25.630 --> 34:27.599
I know...

34:27.632 --> 34:30.268
how much I hurt you, Zoe.

34:31.770 --> 34:35.741
But... everything that
I have done since--

34:35.774 --> 34:38.476
everything that
I want to do--

34:38.510 --> 34:40.812
is to be that
man you saw.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.416
And if you... if you would
even consider giving me

34:44.449 --> 34:46.418
another chance, I mean...

34:46.452 --> 34:48.853
I'm ready.

34:48.887 --> 34:53.091
I'm ready to-to be here
for you in every way.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.499
I love you, Zoe Hart.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.502
Wow.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.273
Got to admit, I was...

35:07.306 --> 35:10.242
kind of hoping for
more than a "wow."

35:10.276 --> 35:13.512
Look, it's become clear to me
that I still have feelings--

35:13.545 --> 35:16.715
deep feelings-- for you, too.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.485
I hear what
you're saying, but...

35:19.518 --> 35:21.487
I'm still getting
over everything.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.822
Which is why, now,

35:23.855 --> 35:25.824
I need some distance,

35:25.857 --> 35:27.826
some perspective.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.795
I need some time.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.499
Yeah, well,
you know...

35:33.532 --> 35:36.502
go to New York
this weekend, and...

35:36.535 --> 35:38.404
and I'll see you
on Monday, right?

35:38.437 --> 35:42.674
I just called my old chief,
and he offered me a job,

35:42.708 --> 35:46.812
so... I'm gonna spend
the summer in New York.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.615
What?

35:49.648 --> 35:52.218
It's only three months.

35:57.789 --> 36:00.626
Yeah. You know...

36:00.659 --> 36:03.929
I'll see you
in three months, Doc.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.419
(knocking on door)
Yeah.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.421
Why'd you leave so fast?

36:29.455 --> 36:31.423
The crowd loved you.
(chuckles)

36:31.457 --> 36:32.924
Uh, well...

36:32.958 --> 36:34.693
because I realized

36:34.726 --> 36:37.829
that writing about my problems
wasn't gonna solve 'em.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.432
But... it was a good start,

36:40.466 --> 36:42.434
so, thanks.
Well...

36:42.468 --> 36:44.670
it just so happens I'm going
on tour tomorrow,

36:44.703 --> 36:46.838
and I could use an extra voice
on the road.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.375
Are you interested?

36:53.412 --> 36:54.780
(indistinct chatter, cheering)

36:54.813 --> 36:57.649
WADE: It's late.
Why is it so crowded?

36:57.683 --> 36:59.685
(gasps)
Oh, no.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.359
Lemon!

37:07.393 --> 37:08.627
It's standing room only.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.628
Isn't that exciting?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.630
Crickett...

37:11.663 --> 37:13.599
Gloriana's not coming.

37:13.632 --> 37:14.633
What are you
talking about?

37:14.666 --> 37:15.867
They're right here.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.403
Guys! Hey...

37:20.806 --> 37:22.941
Tom, Rachel, Mike,
this is Lemon.

37:22.974 --> 37:25.477
Lemon Breeland.
Ah, nice to meet you.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.878
We've heard so much about you.
Our manager

37:26.912 --> 37:29.881
says he's never met
a more persuasive person.

37:29.915 --> 37:30.549
(chuckles)
RACHEL:
Yeah, thank you

37:30.582 --> 37:32.017
so much for having us here.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.485
This place has a great vibe.

37:33.519 --> 37:34.553
Totally. It's great

37:34.586 --> 37:36.288
to meet you guys.
It is showtime.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.623
Are you guys ready to do this?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.325
Let's do this.
All right, thanks.
Let's do it.

37:39.358 --> 37:39.958
Bye.

37:39.991 --> 37:40.926
Bye.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.395
Holy crap.
(squeals)

37:43.429 --> 37:45.931
Lemon Breeland,
you did it.
(giggles)

37:45.964 --> 37:48.600
Unbelievable.
CRICKETT:
Hey, everybody. Here's Gloriana.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.337
Mmm. Come on, mama!

37:51.370 --> 37:52.604
Oh, my God.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.674
("Can't Shake You" begins)

38:05.884 --> 38:08.587
* I still change the station
every time *

38:08.620 --> 38:12.558
* They play that song

38:13.659 --> 38:16.995
* I can't drive
past your house *

38:17.028 --> 38:20.632
* So I take the long way home

38:22.701 --> 38:25.771
* Your black leather jacket
still hangin' *

38:25.804 --> 38:30.376
* In the closet, I wish
that I could give it away *

38:30.409 --> 38:33.812
* Oh, even though you're gone

38:33.845 --> 38:39.385
* Somehow you stay

38:39.418 --> 38:42.554
* And every other time a love

38:42.588 --> 38:45.957
* Said good-bye,
I just shake it off *

38:45.991 --> 38:48.427
* Shake it off

38:48.460 --> 38:50.996
* Pour another drink
so I don't *

38:51.029 --> 38:54.733
* Feel a thing,
I just shake it off *

38:54.766 --> 38:56.868
* Break it off

38:56.902 --> 38:58.970
* Erased all your numbers

38:59.004 --> 39:01.740
* Blocked all your calls

39:01.773 --> 39:03.575
* Tried another lover

39:03.609 --> 39:05.711
* Built up my walls

39:05.744 --> 39:06.912
* Told myself it's over

39:06.945 --> 39:09.448
* Don't know
what else I can do... *

39:09.481 --> 39:10.449
LAVON:
Lemon.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.717
(chuckles)

39:11.750 --> 39:13.619
This night is amazing.
Congrats.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.120
Um, thank you, Lavon.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.789
I-I know that I haven't got
a chance to say it yet,

39:17.823 --> 39:19.891
but congratulations to you, too.

39:19.925 --> 39:23.762
You and AnnaBeth seem...

39:23.795 --> 39:25.030
seem right together.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.132
And you know what?

39:27.165 --> 39:30.802
It inspires me to find
the right person, too.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.473
* And I don't want to see you
but I'm wondering *

39:34.506 --> 39:39.878
* Where you are

39:39.911 --> 39:41.513
* And why am I still keepin'

39:41.547 --> 39:43.148
* The shirt you used
to sleep in? *

39:43.181 --> 39:47.886
* It's been sittin' there
for over a year *

39:47.919 --> 39:55.894
* Oh, even though you left me,
you're still here *

39:55.927 --> 40:00.499
* And every other time
a love said good-bye *

40:00.532 --> 40:04.503
* I just shake it off,
shake it off *

40:04.536 --> 40:06.505
* Pour another drink

40:06.538 --> 40:10.175
* So I don't feel a thing,
I just shake it off *

40:10.208 --> 40:13.945
* Break it off

40:13.979 --> 40:17.983
* Erased all your numbers,
blocked all your calls *

40:18.016 --> 40:19.685
* Tried another lover

40:19.718 --> 40:21.687
* Built up my walls

40:21.720 --> 40:23.955
* Told myself it's over

40:23.989 --> 40:29.661
* Don't know
what else I can do *

40:29.695 --> 40:32.531
* I can't shake you

40:32.564 --> 40:35.066
* I can't shake you

40:35.100 --> 40:37.603
* No matter how hard I try...

40:37.636 --> 40:39.971
MAN:
Hey.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.975
Jonah, what are you doing here?

40:44.009 --> 40:46.044
I didn't want you to spend your
first night in New York alone

40:46.077 --> 40:47.078
at the singles table.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.683
* And every other time

40:51.717 --> 40:54.119
* A love said good-bye, I just

40:54.152 --> 40:57.989
* Shake it off, shake it off

40:58.023 --> 41:00.258
* Pour another drink

41:00.291 --> 41:04.229
* So I don't feel a thing,
I just shake it off *

41:04.262 --> 41:06.698
* Break it off

41:06.732 --> 41:09.000
* Erased all your numbers

41:09.034 --> 41:11.002
* Blocked all your calls...

41:11.036 --> 41:12.604
Fine.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.540
You can go with me
into this wedding,

41:14.573 --> 41:16.007
if you can do it
without talking.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.843
So, what, like,
pretend I'm a... I'm a mute?

41:19.110 --> 41:20.512
Like I lost my tongue
in an accident?

41:20.546 --> 41:21.913
Perfect.

41:21.947 --> 41:22.814
Mm-hmm.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.850
You first.

41:37.729 --> 41:41.733
