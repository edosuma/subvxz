00:40.934 --> 00:43.934
(mellow music playing)

01:07.100 --> 01:08.533
Good morning.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.900
How was your date last night?

01:09.967 --> 01:13.100
I'll let you know when I send him home.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.033
Is this for Rose's birthday?

01:17.100 --> 01:19.300
Don't you start with me.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.600
Every Christmas, every birthday,

01:21.667 --> 01:24.700
any time we have to give a gift
to the same person,

01:24.767 --> 01:28.166
you always find something wrong with mine,
so yours looks better.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.367
I didn't say anything.

01:30.734 --> 01:34.700
But let's face it, those who ignore
history are doomed to repeat it.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.700
Look at the ducky wrapping paper.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.800
And the little stick-on bow.

01:43.867 --> 01:46.100
Did you get her a Ziggy card?

01:46.166 --> 01:47.133
No.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.567
Oh, my. Not snoopy.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.667
I didn't get her a card.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.433
If you're really so worried about this,

01:57.500 --> 02:00.600
I'll just let Rose open yours first
so you won't be embarrassed.

02:00.667 --> 02:02.900
Your ego is so fragile.

02:02.967 --> 02:05.934
You turn everything
into a popularity contest.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.266
I have news for you.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.734
Today, your worst nightmare happens.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.200
Today, I make you look bad.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.533
You hate me 'cause I'm beautiful,
don't you?

02:17.567 --> 02:20.400
There's a man leaving in 10 minutes.
Be under him.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.834
Coming through.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.667
The pope's in town,
and I've got a bus to catch.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.800
Let's see, I've got my binoculars,
my lucky rosary...

02:32.867 --> 02:34.500
Uh-oh, I forgot my whoopee cushion.

02:36.233 --> 02:38.700
Aw, who am I kidding?
Everyone on that bus will be over 80.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.934
It'd be like getting dogs
to bark in a kennel.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.767
What are you talking about, Sophia?

02:44.834 --> 02:47.967
The pope's saying mass on his stopover.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.400
Ma got two tickets. We're going together.

02:50.467 --> 02:54.800
Oh, a papal mass is something
people wait a lifetime for.

02:54.867 --> 02:56.033
Whoops.

02:56.667 --> 03:00.500
Whoops? Is that pope-related
or just another bark in the kennel?

03:01.734 --> 03:06.000
I traded our two bad tickets in the back
for one good ticket way up front.

03:06.066 --> 03:08.200
Ma, what about me?

03:08.266 --> 03:12.300
This is the plan,
we'll get a really long overcoat,

03:12.367 --> 03:15.233
-I'll stand on your shoulders, and--
-And what?

03:15.300 --> 03:17.066
Blend in with the circus folk?

03:18.333 --> 03:23.500
I need to ask the pope
to bless my friend Agnes in the hospital.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.567
That's sweet, but with all those people,

03:27.633 --> 03:30.400
there's no way
you'll get the pope to notice you.

03:31.233 --> 03:32.200
Oh...

03:33.000 --> 03:34.667
He'll notice me.

03:42.033 --> 03:43.233
I'm home!

03:43.300 --> 03:45.200
Rose, happy birthday.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.233
Oh, thanks so much, sweetheart.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.033
An even happier birthday from me.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.500
Aw...

03:51.567 --> 03:53.266
You're hurting me, Dorothy.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.734
Sorry.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.233
Before you do anything else,
I want you to open my gift.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.333
I think you're going to like it.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.300
Oh, isn't that pretty?

04:03.367 --> 04:05.867
(giggles)

04:11.600 --> 04:13.934
Oh, Dorothy!

04:14.600 --> 04:20.200
Oh, a second-hand sweat shirt
with my name misspelled on it.

04:20.967 --> 04:23.066
Oh, you're right, Dorothy. I love it.

04:23.133 --> 04:28.633
Rose, that is the original Mickey Mouse
Club sweat shirt that Roy wore!

04:28.700 --> 04:30.166
I got it at an auction.

04:30.233 --> 04:32.967
Oh, my God. I loved Roy.

04:33.033 --> 04:35.033
Oh, there was something about him.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.300
Woof.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.166
(laughs)

04:38.133 --> 04:39.433
Oh, Dorothy.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.700
I just can't imagine
a better birthday present.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.867
Neither can I. Blanche?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.066
Rose, before I give you mine,
I want to ask you one question.

04:50.133 --> 04:53.300
It may seem odd,
but it has a lot to do with your gift.

04:53.900 --> 04:57.367
Has Miles started wearing bikini
underwear lately?

04:58.033 --> 05:00.567
Blanche, please the pope is in town.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.400
I'm serious.

05:03.467 --> 05:06.133
Actually, Miles did buy some bikinis.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.467
But just the bottoms.

05:13.533 --> 05:15.667
I've been watching Miles for a while.

05:15.734 --> 05:19.333
I think he's going through a crisis,
he's showing all the signs,

05:19.400 --> 05:22.300
trying to act trendy, trying to be young,

05:22.367 --> 05:24.400
and if he's also wearing bikinis...

05:24.467 --> 05:25.834
Just the bottoms.

05:27.066 --> 05:30.533
I'm afraid he may start
playing around on you.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.066
Wait a minute.

05:32.133 --> 05:36.000
None of this proves Miles
is even thinking of cheating on Rose.

05:36.066 --> 05:37.600
You're absolutely right, Dorothy.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.467
And that is why I've hired a detective
to follow Miles

05:41.533 --> 05:42.433
and find out for sure.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.100
Happy birthday, honey.

05:47.500 --> 05:50.834
A detective?
You're giving the gift of suspicion?

05:51.900 --> 05:53.133
That's right.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.333
He'll follow Miles everywhere he goes
for the next two weeks.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.700
If you love any pictures,
you can get them in wallet size.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.934
I can't use this.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.333
She's right.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.066
This violates the privacy
of her relationship,

06:08.133 --> 06:09.600
and I think you should take it back.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.600
You're just trying to make
that stupid sweat shirt look better.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.400
Besides, I can't. I paid in advance.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.066
Can't you get a refund?

06:18.133 --> 06:20.567
Well, no.
I paid with Nature's credit card.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
You never leave home without it.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.166
Blanche, I'm not sure.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.834
Miles has never given me
the slightest reason to distrust him.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.433
Rose, he was in the witness-protection
program.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.200
He lied about his job, his past, his name.

06:51.266 --> 06:52.033
Everything.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.934
Well, it is already paid for.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.700
We're going out now!

07:05.300 --> 07:07.100
Outside on the lanai!

07:10.233 --> 07:13.367
Yes, yes! Here we are!
(laughs)

07:13.433 --> 07:15.333
We're probably going to sit
in these chairs.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.867
Rose, why did we do that?

07:18.934 --> 07:20.200
Did it seem odd?

07:20.266 --> 07:23.867
Well, yes, a little,
but, hey, you're the birthday girl.

07:23.934 --> 07:24.934
(chuckles)

07:25.000 --> 07:26.900
Hey, I got an idea.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.400
I'm feeling a little frisky.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.467
Did you ever make love
in the out of doors?

07:33.066 --> 07:34.533
Miles, no!

07:35.967 --> 07:37.500
Well, just once.

07:39.734 --> 07:43.800
Charlie and I went to St. Olaf's
most romantic outdoor trysting place,

07:44.300 --> 07:45.433
Mount Pushover.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.967
But that place was sacred.

07:51.033 --> 07:52.233
Not out here, Miles.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.667
Oh, come on, Rose.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.066
It's not like anybody
would be watching us.

07:56.567 --> 07:57.233
(clicks)

08:00.033 --> 08:02.066
The others are just inside.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.767
Yeah, they're right inside.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.367
That's what makes it exciting.

08:05.433 --> 08:07.133
Come on, live for the day.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.367
Miles, there's a detective in the bushes.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.433
A detective in the bushes.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.867
Oh, that's perfect.

08:17.934 --> 08:19.734
And you make believe
you're the farmer's daughter

08:19.800 --> 08:21.900
hanging clothes on the line, see?

08:22.767 --> 08:24.800
Oh, come on. Places, everybody.

08:24.867 --> 08:27.467
-Miles!
-No, make up a detective name.

08:27.533 --> 08:30.934
No.
Miles, there is a detective in the bushes.

08:32.300 --> 08:33.367
Come on out.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.433
Right now.

08:35.066 --> 08:37.533
(detective)
I'm not really supposed to let you see me.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
It's like a rule.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.133
Out!

08:43.233 --> 08:45.066
(chuckles)
Sorry.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.467
Rose, what is going on here?

08:47.533 --> 08:50.266
Blanche gave me a detective
for my birthday.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.567
How ya doing?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.700
She was afraid
you might be cheating on me.

08:56.767 --> 08:59.266
Oh, I see.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.500
Blanche is a good friend.

09:00.567 --> 09:03.233
I suppose she was just looking out
for you.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.600
I'm so glad you're not mad at her.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.967
I'm not. I'm mad at you!

09:07.867 --> 09:09.266
As long as it's your birthday,

09:09.333 --> 09:11.266
how about I get one of the two of you
together?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.166
Do you mind?

09:14.233 --> 09:16.033
Why are you mad at me?

09:16.100 --> 09:17.867
You should have known you could trust me.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.834
This is an insult
to our whole relationship!

09:21.934 --> 09:23.100
Miles!

09:23.166 --> 09:24.200
Miles!

09:24.800 --> 09:26.400
(sighs)

09:27.166 --> 09:29.066
-Miles, big news.
-Later.

09:32.066 --> 09:33.934
-Rose--
-I'm busy, Sophia.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.533
Dorothy, I can't breathe!

09:37.600 --> 09:38.934
Not now, Ma.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.967
This better be good.

09:43.033 --> 09:45.400
I don't know.
How good would you consider...

09:45.467 --> 09:46.700
the pope's ring.

09:48.033 --> 09:51.133
Okay, Ma, squirt me in the eye
and get it over with.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.100
No. This is his ring.

09:54.834 --> 09:55.667
Look.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.533
My God. Ma...

09:59.133 --> 10:01.333
This looks real.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.734
It is real.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.100
You think he'd wear his fakes
in public like Zsa Zsa?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.166
But how did this happen?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.066
Picture it.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.934
The papal mass.

10:11.567 --> 10:12.600
A few hours ago.

10:13.233 --> 10:15.100
I want to cop a blessing for Agnes,

10:15.166 --> 10:17.867
so I sneak into the crippled
and lame section.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.433
Ma, how could you?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.967
With a pronounced limp.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.233
The pope finally arrives,
I bend down to kiss his ring.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.700
Just then security comes
and whisks him away.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.834
He leaves the ring behind as a memento.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.700
Ma, you stole the pope's ring?

10:38.934 --> 10:40.000
It slipped off.

10:40.066 --> 10:42.000
You know,
for God's representative on Earth,

10:42.066 --> 10:44.066
he sure has sweaty palms.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.800
You're taking it back.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.000
This is a sign.
Maybe I'm supposed to make a miracle.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.233
Hey, maybe this is my shot
at getting into the bible.

10:58.066 --> 11:00.600
Ma, the bible is a done deal.

11:03.133 --> 11:04.834
You can't keep it.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.967
We're talking about a millenniums-old
symbol of the pope's authority,

11:09.033 --> 11:11.867
something so steeped
in history and tradition

11:11.934 --> 11:14.400
that it makes even you seem middle-aged.

11:16.133 --> 11:16.934
You're right.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.100
I'll bring it back.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.233
Wine!

11:35.967 --> 11:36.800
Worth a shot.

11:44.367 --> 11:47.000
Well, I finally got Miles to forgive me.

11:47.066 --> 11:51.467
He must have made promise a million times
I'd never, ever doubt him again.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.600
We should read the detective's report.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.734
Okay.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.400
Rose.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.400
Dorothy, I want to hear that report
because I do trust Miles.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.667
It will prove
that both of you should, too.

12:04.734 --> 12:05.900
Oh, no. Listen to this.

12:05.967 --> 12:08.734
"9:30. Confirmed surgery
for the following day."

12:08.800 --> 12:10.467
Surgery? On what?

12:10.533 --> 12:11.667
That's all it says.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.066
Oh, my God.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.734
Now, honey, don't panic.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.433
It may not be anything serious.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.300
Of course, it's serious.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.934
If it was minor, he would have told me.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.433
That's why he's been living for the day.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.066
He's afraid there won't be a tomorrow.

12:28.533 --> 12:29.900
This may not be a good time,

12:29.967 --> 12:32.734
but has anyone seen a large,
jewel-encrusted ring

12:32.800 --> 12:35.266
that's steeped in history
just lying around lately?

12:40.900 --> 12:44.734
(quirky music playing)

12:45.367 --> 12:48.567
I'm damned. I'll never see Sal in heaven.

12:48.633 --> 12:49.767
Now, take it easy, Ma.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.567
Let's retrace your steps.

12:51.633 --> 12:53.367
What did you do when you first got home?

12:53.433 --> 12:57.066
Nap on the couch,
on the bed, on the lanai.

12:57.133 --> 12:59.066
I do so much it's all a blur.

12:59.967 --> 13:02.166
Then we'll have to search room by room.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.900
It's hopeless. We'll never find it.

13:03.967 --> 13:08.433
Let's wait and pray it turns up,
say, in the next day or two.

13:11.000 --> 13:11.900
What?

13:11.967 --> 13:16.166
Those are the exact words you used
when my gold bracelet was missing.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.166
So?

13:17.233 --> 13:20.200
So, two days later,
you came back from the dentist saying,

13:20.266 --> 13:23.033
"Are these fillings,
or are these fillings?"

13:26.233 --> 13:28.867
What's your point? You didn't lose it.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.066
You said it so you could keep it.

13:31.133 --> 13:34.400
I swear on my life I don't have it.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.834
You want me to turn you upside down
and shake you?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.000
You're bluffing.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.767
-Okay, have it your way.
-Here! Here!

13:42.500 --> 13:44.734
I'm sorry, pussycat.
It'll never happen again.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.066
I can't believe this.

13:46.133 --> 13:49.600
You, of all people,
should know the value of this ring.

13:49.667 --> 13:54.867
I can't give it up until I know
the pope's going to bless Agnes.

13:54.934 --> 13:58.133
It doesn't matter what your reasons are.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.400
This ring is important.
It was wrong to take it.

14:01.467 --> 14:04.166
I'm going to see
that it gets back tomorrow.

14:04.233 --> 14:05.967
Forget it. I'm not going.

14:06.033 --> 14:07.166
What's wrong?

14:07.233 --> 14:10.300
Blanche thinks I should go
to the hospital tomorrow.

14:10.367 --> 14:14.300
If Miles didn't tell me, doesn't that mean
he doesn't want me there?

14:14.367 --> 14:16.700
You're about to make a grave mistake.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.100
You come to me for advice on men.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.033
You go to Dorothy,
if there's grammar you want help with.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.834
You ended that sentence
with a preposition just to bait me.

14:31.533 --> 14:32.934
What would I do that for?

14:36.600 --> 14:37.834
I can settle this.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.233
Let me tell you a story
of the steamy south,

14:40.300 --> 14:42.367
a tale of deception and tragedy.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.100
Just a second, Uncle Remus.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.600
Give me the ring.
I'll tell the pope to bless you, too.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.800
Ma, Blanche is telling a story.

14:51.867 --> 14:53.400
Oh, sorry. Go on.

14:53.834 --> 14:54.734
(sighs)

14:54.800 --> 14:56.433
-I was 19.
-Fine.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.233
He might have a blessing that gets men.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.233
Ma!

15:02.300 --> 15:04.033
I thought she was finished.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.967
She just said she was 19.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.533
Look at her now.
You don't call that a tragedy?

15:11.767 --> 15:14.433
Ma, it is going back, and that's final.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
Go ahead, Blanche.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.800
No. The mood has been ruined.

15:17.867 --> 15:21.467
Suffice it to say,
it involved a men's club, a vine rope,

15:21.533 --> 15:23.767
and a large bottle of Absorbine Jr.

15:25.100 --> 15:29.066
How could you possibly think
that this would help Rose decide

15:29.133 --> 15:32.033
what to do about Miles
being in the hospital?

15:32.100 --> 15:35.100
Oh, Blanche, God bless you.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.000
I see it all so clearly now.

15:38.734 --> 15:41.066
I don't care what Miles does.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.433
I'm going to be at that hospital
tomorrow.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.200
And she still hasn't worn
your sweat shirt.

15:56.467 --> 15:57.467
Thank you.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.533
I called the diocese like you told me.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.800
The pope will be here soon
to get his ring.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.633
The pope's coming here?

16:03.700 --> 16:06.633
This is horrible. What will I wear?

16:07.867 --> 16:11.233
I don't believe I have a thing
that doesn't call attention to my bosom.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.767
Try not wearing make-up.

16:17.767 --> 16:21.600
Ma, do you actually think
that the pope makes house calls?

16:21.667 --> 16:22.734
He will this time.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.467
I made it crystal clear over the phone,

16:24.533 --> 16:27.734
if I don't see a pope on the porch,
they can kiss their ring goodbye.

16:28.900 --> 16:32.100
You're forgetting one thing,
I have the ring.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.867
That's the one hole in my plan.

16:35.166 --> 16:38.333
Look, Ma, I know you're disturbed
about your friend.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.600
But the pope coming to people's houses,
things like that just don't happen.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.100
That's the difference
between you and me, pussycat.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.567
I believe in miracles.

16:46.633 --> 16:47.700
(doorbell rings)

16:47.767 --> 16:48.600
Excuse me.

16:49.066 --> 16:50.300
Popes hate to be kept waiting.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.467
Good evening. I'm here about the ring.

16:57.533 --> 16:58.734
You're not the pope.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.934
Not yet, but like they say,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.200
"You never know when the smoke
will blow your way."

17:06.266 --> 17:07.467
You're not getting it.

17:07.533 --> 17:09.233
Father, you'll have to excuse my mother.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.467
She has a special feeling about the ring.

17:11.533 --> 17:13.066
Take it and go.

17:13.133 --> 17:13.867
Wait.

17:13.934 --> 17:15.934
I want his holiness to visit my friend.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.967
She's sick.

17:18.033 --> 17:20.166
What is your friend's name?

17:20.233 --> 17:21.433
No miracles, huh?

17:22.000 --> 17:22.900
Agnes O'Rourke.

17:22.967 --> 17:26.834
I'm sure you'll understand the pontiff
can't make individual visits,

17:26.900 --> 17:29.567
but I assure you a prayer will be said.

17:29.633 --> 17:30.767
That's it?

17:31.233 --> 17:32.367
Thank you, father.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.133
Oh, Ma, I'm so sorry.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.667
I know how disappointed you are,

17:40.734 --> 17:44.567
but giving that ring back
was the right thing to do.

17:44.633 --> 17:46.400
I'm off to see Miles.

17:46.467 --> 17:47.934
I hope he's all right.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.266
I'll go with you.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.934
Agnes needs me now.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.300
Goodbye, Dorothy.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.667
If I'm not home soon,
that probably means Agnes is dead.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.233
If Agnes is dead, you killed her,

18:00.166 --> 18:03.000
and if you killed her,
that makes you a murderer.

18:03.834 --> 18:04.934
Enjoy, Ma.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.200
Miles?

18:16.266 --> 18:18.967
Oh, my poor Miles.

18:19.033 --> 18:19.967
Rose?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.900
(Miles) Rose, is that you? Over here!

18:25.100 --> 18:27.867
Listen to my little soldier.

18:27.934 --> 18:29.734
Knocking on heaven's door

18:29.800 --> 18:32.934
and still throwing his voice
to make me laugh.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.100
No, Rose. Rose, over here!

18:36.166 --> 18:37.233
This bed.

18:39.033 --> 18:39.900
Miles?

18:44.934 --> 18:45.767
Miles?

18:45.834 --> 18:46.800
Miles!

18:46.867 --> 18:49.433
Sweetheart,
may I ask what are you doing here?

18:49.500 --> 18:51.700
I didn't want you to see me like this.

18:51.767 --> 18:52.867
I know.

18:52.934 --> 18:56.133
I just wanted a chance to say I love you,

18:57.100 --> 18:59.800
and there will be no other man after.

19:00.266 --> 19:01.133
After?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.033
After what?

19:04.100 --> 19:05.533
I'm here for my eyes.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.533
Oh, thank God you're not going to die.

19:08.166 --> 19:10.533
Oh, and don't worry.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.400
I can be your eyes.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.467
Oh, sweetheart, my eyes are fine.

19:14.533 --> 19:16.533
It's just the bags underneath them.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.066
Then I can be your bags.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.333
Rose, sweetheart, you don't understand.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.734
I'm here for cosmetic surgery.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.233
Cosmetic surgery?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.033
Why?

19:29.567 --> 19:31.300
Because I look old, Rose.

19:31.834 --> 19:34.900
You have any idea what it's like
working on a college campus?

19:34.967 --> 19:37.467
I've never worked on one,

19:37.533 --> 19:40.700
but I was the subject
of a lab experiment once.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.967
You never told me that.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.000
They doubled my IQ.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.667
For three days I was another Einstein.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.734
Then they pulled out the IV.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.700
What was in that IV?

19:56.166 --> 19:57.967
Smart juice, I guess.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.700
Honey, you don't have your eyes done.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.533
Oh, Rose, I know, it's silly.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.934
But, you know,
I'm in a youthful environment

20:07.000 --> 20:08.600
and I wanna feel youthful.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.867
Well, if it's important to you,
I'll support you.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.266
But why didn't you tell me about it
earlier?

20:14.333 --> 20:16.667
Well, for the same reason
that those formulas

20:16.734 --> 20:19.033
that dye hair do it gradually.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.033
It's the kind of thing
you want people to notice

20:21.100 --> 20:22.800
but not to be able to pinpoint.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.200
I didn't know you dyed your hair.

20:27.633 --> 20:31.066
Rose, my hair is grey,
it's been grey since we met.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.133
Boy, that is gradual.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.066
Oh, darling, I'm just glad you're okay.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.633
I have had the worst day and a half,

20:40.700 --> 20:43.033
and it's all because
of that dumb detective.

20:43.867 --> 20:47.700
Sweetheart, let's promise,
we'll never let something like this

20:47.767 --> 20:48.700
come between us again.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.500
I promise. From now on, no more fighting.

20:51.567 --> 20:52.700
Good.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
By the way, how did you know I was here?

20:56.233 --> 20:58.033
Well, that didn't last long, did it?

20:59.433 --> 21:00.834
-Hello.
-(Miles) Hello, Sophia.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.500
Oh, Sophia, how's Agnes?

21:02.567 --> 21:04.300
The same. Is he okay?

21:04.367 --> 21:07.433
Oh, yes. He's having cosmetic surgery.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.734
It's about time.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.400
I'll be in the John.

21:14.967 --> 21:16.166
Reading material.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.467
(ruckus in the hall)

21:24.533 --> 21:25.200
What?

21:25.500 --> 21:26.333
Who could that...

21:30.400 --> 21:32.767
Oh, my, it's him!

21:33.367 --> 21:34.467
I think.

21:35.133 --> 21:35.834
Father...

21:37.200 --> 21:40.500
-Could that be who I think it is?
-Indeed.

21:40.567 --> 21:44.000
The pontiff is stopping by
to bless the patients of St. Ignatius

21:44.066 --> 21:45.233
on his way to the airport.

21:45.300 --> 21:46.100
The pontiff?

21:46.166 --> 21:48.200
Oh, no, Rose, let him go.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.266
No, father, I wouldn't feel right.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.834
I'm here for crow's feet.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.800
You're right, he doesn't do that.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.233
(knocks)

21:58.300 --> 22:00.300
Sophia, you won't believe it!

22:00.934 --> 22:03.100
You know who's here? The pope is here!

22:03.166 --> 22:04.834
Sophia, the pope!

22:05.433 --> 22:08.166
(Sophia)
All my life I've been waiting for this.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.367
Oh, okay, I won't disturb you.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.000
Pussycat, pussycat, I witnessed a miracle.

22:22.066 --> 22:24.400
The pope came to the hospital
and blessed Agnes.

22:24.467 --> 22:26.667
He answered my prayers. He answered me.

22:26.734 --> 22:28.633
Oh, ye of little faith.

22:29.867 --> 22:32.367
Oh, you must feel special, Sophia.

22:32.433 --> 22:33.333
You must feel blessed.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.166
And hungry.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.400
Come on, Rose.

22:37.467 --> 22:40.133
Let's go into the kitchen
and whip up some loaves and fishes.

22:41.133 --> 22:44.900
Oh, he had the most beautiful blue eyes.

22:44.967 --> 22:47.700
Yeah. All the cute guys
are either married or popes.

22:49.233 --> 22:54.734
(upbeat music playing)

22:57.066 --> 22:58.967
Ace to the pair. No help for the pontiff.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.333
Read 'em and weep.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.133
Full boat.

23:06.533 --> 23:09.734
High spade in the hole goes to heaven.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.467
So, any chance of me winning
back that ring?

23:19.066 --> 23:21.166
Nah, I don't have to cut.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.166
I trust you.
