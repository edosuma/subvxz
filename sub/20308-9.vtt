WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:04.796
(clock ticking)

00:07.132 --> 00:09.467
ROBIN: Mick, what's that noise?

00:10.343 --> 00:11.469
What noise?

00:12.095 --> 00:13.513
(alarm blaring)

00:14.556 --> 00:15.390
The baby!

00:17.809 --> 00:19.644
(baby crying)

00:21.312 --> 00:23.148
NEWSMAN: <i>We're getting scattered reports.</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:26.026
It appears there's been a miscalculation.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.485
MAN 1 (on radio): <i>This is terrible.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.362
<i>This is one of the worst catastrophes</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:31.906
(indistinct shouting on the radio)

00:35.702 --> 00:39.330
MAN 2 (over PA): <i>We repeat,</i>
<i>this is your civil defense coordinator.</i>

00:39.414 --> 00:41.916
<i>All children proceed to their schools.</i>

00:42.500 --> 00:44.919
<i>Put your hands over your heads.</i>

00:45.170 --> 00:46.796
NEWSMAN:
<i>It appears there's been a miscalculation.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.090
<i>Missiles have been launched.</i>

00:50.258 --> 00:51.384
MICK: Throw things in, quick.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.720
<i>I repeat, missiles...</i>
(voice distorting)

00:57.807 --> 00:59.142
(alarm stops)

01:03.480 --> 01:04.773
MICK: Quiet out there.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.456
-(explosion)
-(screaming)

01:22.207 --> 01:24.084
-(screams)
-Mick!

01:24.709 --> 01:25.752
Mick, are you okay?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.213
-(baby crying)
-You're soaked.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.214
(gasps)

01:29.297 --> 01:31.007
Come here. Shh, you're sweating.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.512
Item 12, and people,
I pass this on without comment,

01:35.595 --> 01:38.848
it arrived in the mail yesterday,
of Israeli manufacture

01:38.932 --> 01:42.560
and claims to be constructed
of, uh, molybdenum.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.355
"Diecast woven materials
for comfort, strength

01:45.438 --> 01:48.483
and many months
of trouble free wash and wear service."

01:48.566 --> 01:51.402
-What is it?
-It's a bulletproof athletic supporter.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.113
(laughing)

01:54.030 --> 01:55.990
I think I'm gonna take one of those
home with me tonight.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
HOWARD: All right, item 13.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.578
We have had two more tire iron attacks

02:00.662 --> 02:04.082
on homosexuals in the vicinity
of the gay bars on Hattel.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.710
One victim is critical,
the other has a fractured skull.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.462
I have posted the description

02:09.546 --> 02:12.340
of the two Caucasian male bashers
on the board.

02:12.423 --> 02:17.512
Let's, uh, make sure that these gents
get their Christmas poultry

02:17.595 --> 02:20.014
compliments of Michigan Avenue, shall we?

02:21.432 --> 02:22.809
And Detective Belker.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.856
When do you expect
to wrap up your Barnswell case?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.694
Barnswell, Detective.

02:33.069 --> 02:36.197
(kissing) Here, Mick. Here, Mick. Wake up.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.200
-Yeah, uh...
-(laughing)

02:39.909 --> 02:41.703
No action today. Barnswell is out of town.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.288
Duly noted.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.583
All right, item 14.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.710
The parking lot continues under repair.

02:48.793 --> 02:49.794
Oh, man.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.839
New completion date is next Thursday.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.299
Item the last.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.134
Uh, we are receiving a visitor today

02:56.217 --> 03:00.096
arranged with the gracious forethought
of the retirement subcommittee

03:00.180 --> 03:02.307
of your
Patrolman's Benevolence Association.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.058
Mr. Morton Keyes.

03:04.142 --> 03:08.688
Mr. Keyes will be selling funeral plots
at attractive union discounts.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.690
That's it. Keep your powder dry.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.318
Keep your spirits high. And don't forget,

03:13.902 --> 03:16.779
the wind chill factor may be 14 below,

03:16.863 --> 03:19.699
but that whole indicator is a crude trick

03:19.782 --> 03:23.828
perpetrated by the international wimp
weatherman's conspiracy

03:24.204 --> 03:26.664
to undermine our American manhood.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.835
It's a comfortable 22 degrees out there.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.629
-(chattering)
-Ow.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.341
Russo.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.928
You policemen all parked in my lot.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.596
My customers have no place to park.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.806
I lose breakfast customer, I lose lunch.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.892
Mr. Chun, when we spoke on the phone,

03:45.975 --> 03:48.019
-I explained to you--
-No explain. Car move.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.397
Mr. Chun, until our own parking lot
is resurfaced,

03:51.481 --> 03:54.943
it's not fair to you,
but your lot is the next closest to ours.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.611
Cop use my parking,

03:56.694 --> 03:58.571
but do cop ever eat
in my restaurant? Never.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.573
-Sometimes. I know.
-Open breakfast now, too.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.117
Good breakfast. Bacon, egg, Korean roll.

04:03.201 --> 04:07.372
Mr. Chun,
I can't change their eating habits,

04:07.664 --> 04:09.332
but I will make another announcement.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.001
Tell them 8:00, tow truck coming, huh.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.711
-Car towed.
-Car towed.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.520
(coughs) Yes.

04:30.603 --> 04:36.150
Uh, line out for information
for, uh, District of Columbia.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.404
Frank, uh, long distance line six.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.032
Captain Furillo.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.742
Yes.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.038
What?

04:51.040 --> 04:51.874
Where?

04:54.836 --> 04:55.920
What's his condition?

04:58.214 --> 04:59.132
(clears throat) Yes.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.219
Yes. Damn it, yes, I understand.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.888
Yeah, but-- Well, if she--

05:07.265 --> 05:09.350
You have a number where I can reach her?

05:13.271 --> 05:16.107
Please. Yeah, I'll wait right here.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.196
They sent me up from traffic
which is kind of the way I like it.

05:22.530 --> 05:26.576
Well, this is the only free desk
that we have, Mr. Keyes.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.913
You know my most successful line
over there?

05:30.997 --> 05:33.666
I used to-- You know, most of them
young guys can't afford homes,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.835
so I tell them a plot is their entrance
to the real estate market.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.629
Who is this?
This is a citizen. Michael Belker.

05:38.713 --> 05:42.342
Look, ma'am, I'm quite upset,
and I would like to speak...

05:44.927 --> 05:47.430
All right, fine. I will leave a message.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.434
I had a nightmare.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.563
Something happened with us and Russia.
We blew ourselves up.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.901
Now, I'm a police officer
and I know how hairy it gets out there.

06:00.526 --> 06:04.530
I want to be sure we're being very careful
for my baby.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.949
Will you see that the president gets that?

06:08.534 --> 06:11.371
Good. Because it's very important.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.379
Personal long distance, detective.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.465
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:23.257 --> 06:24.509
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:28.304
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:28.388 --> 06:30.014
(sirens wailing)

06:35.686 --> 06:38.773
(theme music playing)

07:38.291 --> 07:41.335
I don't believe this.
I do not believe this.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.087
Somebody bagged my short.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.257
-(chuckles) Parked in the Korean's lot?
-Yeah.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.136
The one with the sign that says,
"No parking except for patrons only?"

07:51.637 --> 07:53.264
Where are you going with this, Neal?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.058
Are you saying he towed my car?

07:56.684 --> 07:59.437
He towed a police officer's vehicle?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.272
Hey, I was looking to tell you, babe.

08:01.355 --> 08:04.192
Goldblume posted a warning
about an hour ago.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.152
Notice says among other things,
wouldn't hurt

08:06.235 --> 08:08.488
if we patronized the guy's place
once in a while.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.864
Oh, yeah, Lieutenant.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.492
Having my car towed
gives me a hell of an appetite.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.869
Especially for seaweed and snake sauce.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.129
Any word?

08:27.507 --> 08:28.966
I'll call again, then we'll go.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.185
-Detective.
-Sergeant.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.604
In fact,
the very man that I am looking for.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.398
-Here.
-What's this?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.067
It's a prospectus.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.153
-First Strike Estates?
-Mm-hm.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.364
You remember a few years back

08:51.447 --> 08:54.367
that I purchased an underground condo
in the Alleghanies?

08:54.450 --> 08:56.244
-Underground condo?
-Mm-hm.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.330
America needs
positive thinkers, Detective.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.500
Men who can think the unthinkable.

09:04.335 --> 09:09.090
Your touching, albeit naive exercise
in Jeffersonian democracy

09:09.173 --> 09:11.676
made me suspect
that you might be a customer.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.928
If you're referring to
my phone call, Sergeant,

09:14.011 --> 09:15.388
that was private and personal.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.305
Hm, whatever.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.102
In a nuclear storm, a handy port,
my friend, I wouldn't be without mine.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.230
Ah, you see the rumpus room there.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.190
For little Belker and his friends.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.817
This is very small.

09:28.192 --> 09:31.195
Mick, the Japanese live in closets.
We have to make a few adjustments.

09:31.279 --> 09:35.616
I mean, Judas, life underground
is not all fun and video games.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.952
-You have video games?
-Yes.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.914
I contributed <i>The 30 Years War</i>
from my library.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.082
I don't know that one.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.460
Well, some people might think of it
as in bad taste,

09:46.544 --> 09:49.213
but it had practical lessons
for the kiddies.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.466
-You keep that prospectus.
-(toilet flushes)

10:02.977 --> 10:05.938
Phone number's on the desk.
If anything comes up, don't hesitate.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.274
Should be okay. Safe trip.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.484
-Thank you.
-Uh, none of my business--

10:10.568 --> 10:13.738
There was either a burglary or a robbery

10:13.821 --> 10:15.740
at my parents' house. My father was shot.

10:16.073 --> 10:16.907
He's critical.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.666
Can I use your phone, Maurice?

10:25.750 --> 10:26.876
Where you calling to?

10:27.668 --> 10:30.671
-Police.
-Uh, I'm the police. What's the problem?

10:31.756 --> 10:32.673
You-- you're police?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.550
-Yeah.
-Come on now.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.513
Come here. Now I didn't want to touch it

10:39.597 --> 10:41.307
'cause, see,
I know somebody could come back later

10:41.390 --> 10:43.017
and make an accusation on me.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.565
There's people living
in this building or not, sir?

10:50.691 --> 10:52.610
Just some old folks like me.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.490
See, this building is condemned,
but everybody knows people living in it.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.200
You ask anybody whose this is?

10:59.283 --> 11:01.619
Heard some crying, I come down.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.621
-I asked everybody.
-All right.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.123
I'm gonna take this little guy
down to the precinct.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.254
And if anybody comes for him,
you have them call me, okay?

11:16.884 --> 11:20.596
How would you feel
about a rumpus room 8x11?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.515
You know how big that is?

11:22.848 --> 11:24.684
That's slightly smaller than this car.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.479
Of course, you could have a lot
of tapes in there. Tapes aren't bad.

11:29.063 --> 11:32.274
You get into bed, you curl up with a tape.
I like that.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.777
You could see a tree, a lake.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.445
You could see a dog on tape.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.989
Actually, you know,
a dog is not that good.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.534
You got to smell a dog
for a dog to be good.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.289
This is ND4. You got anything
on those basher individuals?

11:47.373 --> 11:50.000
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Assault with deadly.</i>
<i>Back of Black Hole Club on Van Buren.</i>

11:50.084 --> 11:53.045
RENKO: <i>2202, we're on it.</i>
<i>Two Cauc males, both dark hair.</i>

11:53.129 --> 11:55.798
This is ND4.
They're on Portland. I'm in pursuit.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.175
(siren blaring)

12:00.052 --> 12:02.805
I got the tall one.
West in the Downey alley.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.560
(radio chatter)

12:17.820 --> 12:18.904
(tires squeal)

12:35.087 --> 12:36.881
(grunts)

12:41.051 --> 12:43.012
You're under arrest, armpit.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.223
Suspicion, assault and attempted murder.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.475
(horn honks)

12:53.647 --> 12:56.192
You know, this other guy got away.
We think he got on a train.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.819
You want to take this one back for me?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.072
-RENKO: Yeah.
-My car's not here.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.699
Where is it?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.129
Frank.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.466
He died a few minutes ago.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.010
Frank! Frank!

13:24.094 --> 13:26.931
I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.933
-Mama.
-Somebody get her a sedative.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.893
Just get her sitting. She'll be okay.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.442
Who'd kill a harmless retired man?
Who'd do that?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.447
We were going ice fishing Saturday morning
up at Thompkins Creek.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.158
I had a cabin reserved.
I just sent in the check.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.910
I got him his license.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.539
He hadn't been there.
Not since we were kids.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.124
Frank, do you remember,
we used to go to Thompkins Creek?

13:54.208 --> 13:55.042
DOCTOR: Joseph.

13:55.876 --> 13:56.752
Dr. Consilvio.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.008
-You know my brother Frank.
-Long time. Frank.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.220
Medically, he didn't stand a chance.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.472
Although, it was painless at the end.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.433
Whereas, if it's any consolation,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.936
his final months
would have been not so easy.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.523
Yeah, well, look, Doctor,
I've got to talk to my brother about that.

14:18.065 --> 14:18.899
What?

14:19.483 --> 14:21.360
No, really. Really, I will.
It's all right.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.655
-Sorry, I didn't mean to betray anything.
-Was my father sick?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.532
Frank, I found out by accident.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.701
He didn't want any more people to know.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.539
(whispers) He had a brain tumor.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.795
-I want to see him.
-You may want to wait.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.380
I'll see him now.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.644
Instant-- No, please just come over.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.023
Would you try to eat
a little something, Anna?

14:59.106 --> 15:00.941
I'll make you a slice of toast.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.068
-No.
-Tea, Mrs. Furillo?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.447
Uh, all right, thank you, dear.
But just half a cup.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.949
Captain Furillo, can I see you a moment?

15:09.617 --> 15:12.453
Sir, when will you be through
with your work?

15:12.536 --> 15:15.122
Because I can't have my house
being Central Park.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.000
I hope by 3:00. I'm sorry.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.966
When you're free, could we talk?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.217
-Of course, Father.
-Thank you.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.803
Lieutenant Patterson.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.472
First, my sympathies.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.683
And please know we're treating this
as you're one of our own.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.853
But we're not starting
in too good of field position.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.647
Latents look hard to come by.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.690
The gun's an old .32. We don't have it.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.817
And neighbors confirm
your mother's sense of the timing.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.071
Uh, they heard something.
Had to be a single shot.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.490
About ten minutes later,
your mom came back.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.325
They didn't see anybody in or out?

15:51.408 --> 15:53.702
Neighbors in front figure the guy
had to use the back door.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.998
-Joe?
-Uh, let me get to work here.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.668
I was just over at Holy Saints.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.461
I put the down on the package.

16:03.128 --> 16:07.424
Joe, you didn't tell me he was sick.
Is there anything else?

16:09.301 --> 16:10.552
-What?
-Is there anything else?

16:11.428 --> 16:12.596
Frank.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.931
No. No.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.308
You weren't here.
I just happened to find out.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.228
It was a pledge to Papa.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.772
Mama knew?

16:22.439 --> 16:24.274
The last month, and it's been hell on her.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.618
Let me ask you, Mr. Coslow.
Is your tow license up to date?

16:35.035 --> 16:36.161
You sure of that, huh?

16:36.870 --> 16:40.165
Let me inform you, if by some miracle
you are properly licensed,

16:40.249 --> 16:42.251
that this was a mint '81 Regal.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.670
So if there's so much as a nick
in the paintjob,

16:44.753 --> 16:48.590
it's gonna cost you 100 times
your lousy 68 bucks.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.342
What?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.515
This guy is laming me, there's a scratch
on the driver's side door.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.850
Where Renko nicked you?

16:58.934 --> 17:02.813
It's wise guys like you and that Korean
make my life a struggle, Neal.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.483
So get the grill situation taken care of.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.943
I won't tell you what day I'm coming back,

17:08.027 --> 17:10.112
but if it's not fixed,
I cite you for the fine.

17:13.365 --> 17:17.077
Can you believe that? My health inspector
retires early and they send me this.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.495
Seems like an honest fella.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.497
Yeah, you believe that?

17:21.749 --> 17:22.583
Excuse me.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.254
Excuse me. LaRue, Hill Street precinct.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.465
Peter Regan, Health and Safety.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.799
You're the guy, Pete.

17:31.467 --> 17:35.512
I was over at Chun's Soul Food
on Hill and McAdam a couple hours ago.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.474
He's got rats
the size of chihuahuas in there.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.559
Thanks for the word. I'll tell the guy
who covers east of Dekker.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.312
Tell the guy, huh?
You hear that, Detective?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.191
-How long you been on the job, Pete?
-Three months.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.694
You think when some multiple rape
homicide's in progress

17:50.778 --> 17:53.822
the cop on the beat
stops to ask if it's on his beat?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.450
No way. It's protect and serve time.

17:56.533 --> 18:00.204
Uh, no offense,
but homicide rape's different

18:00.287 --> 18:01.622
from a little rodential infestation.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.291
You don't see the principle in common?

18:04.917 --> 18:05.959
Hey, forget it, J.D.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.046
This guy's got a big behind.
He's in it for the pension.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.801
Now, look, fellas, you're wrong about me.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.471
I see paper shufflers
all over my department.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.680
Turns my stomach.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.809
I'll drop by there in a couple hours.
How's that?

18:23.227 --> 18:25.521
You renew my faith in the civil service.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.397
Thank you.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.374
Amazing.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.045
Every time I can remember being with him

18:50.420 --> 18:53.799
back to when I was ten years old...

18:56.051 --> 18:57.302
it was like a struggle.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.723
My insides knotted up.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.353
And it's how I feel now.

19:08.814 --> 19:09.982
Even at his death.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.321
-Because he didn't tell you he was sick?
-I don't know.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.453
My mom had four operations in four years.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.957
Every one, she never said a word

19:27.040 --> 19:30.878
until she was back home
and up on her feet again.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.216
Finally, I'd call her doctor
every six months.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.178
His nurse became my Deep Throat.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.685
It's not the same, is it?

19:50.439 --> 19:51.273
It's not.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.154
Because your mother loved you.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.744
And in my heart, I feel as if...

20:04.995 --> 20:06.371
to the moment he died...

20:08.832 --> 20:10.417
my father had contempt for me.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.253
And wanted to hurt me.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.508
I love you.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.739
Let's go inside. I have to do something.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.111
.32 caliber. One bullet missing.

21:23.448 --> 21:26.451
You know, anybody steals a '79 Plymouth,

21:26.535 --> 21:28.620
I mean, what good is it?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.539
They're probably stoned.
I mean, they made a mistake.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.542
I made the mistake. Me. Okay?

21:33.834 --> 21:36.461
Plus the kid, you know?
Soon as that kid starts crying,

21:36.545 --> 21:38.380
I mean, they're gonna freak.
They're gonna take off like hell.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.049
Look, Sergeant,
you think you could can the speculation

21:41.133 --> 21:42.718
until this-this thing's over?

21:42.926 --> 21:46.305
RADIO: <i>Units in vicinity,</i>
<i>report vehicle fitting ND description.</i>

21:46.388 --> 21:48.807
<i>Vehicle has collided</i>
<i>with Riverton Bridge abutment.</i>

21:48.890 --> 21:50.267
-Oh, my God.
-(siren blaring)

21:50.350 --> 21:51.727
(tires squeal)

22:12.914 --> 22:13.749
Hey, Mick!

22:14.416 --> 22:18.045
Hey, Mick, the tow truck
and all the emergency stuff is on its way.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.130
Don't go in there! Get out of there!

22:24.259 --> 22:26.720
You, spaceball, are busted.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.851
(car creaking)

22:33.435 --> 22:34.394
(explosion)

22:44.571 --> 22:45.989
No, why even call her?

22:46.073 --> 22:48.408
She's not gonna come anyway.
She's in Alaska.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.702
Oh, I wouldn't spend the long distance.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.496
Mama, Joe.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.166
Frank, tell your brother

22:56.249 --> 22:59.169
how cruel Aunt Clara was
to me and Papa all our lives.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.087
Mama, sit a minute.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.839
No, I just got these few minutes
while the aunts are out.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.716
-Place is a pigsty.
-Please, Mama.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.848
Mama, we have another problem.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.476
W-what is it?

23:15.060 --> 23:15.977
Did Papa...

23:17.979 --> 23:19.106
did Papa take his own life?

23:19.523 --> 23:20.774
-Frank!
-What are you talking about?

23:20.857 --> 23:23.318
Papa was robbed.
I came home from the store.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.695
Mama, stop, stop. What is it with you?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.823
What are you doing? What, are you crazy?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.784
He's dead. Papa's dead.
Will you just leave it?

23:30.867 --> 23:33.120
If you don't know
what you're talking about, shut up.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.288
But if you're being dishonest with me now,
you go to hell.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.707
Oh, that's good.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.585
Oh, that's really good, Frank.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.754
He's the big time cop.

23:43.171 --> 23:46.049
He's coming in to interrogate
about his own father's death.

23:46.425 --> 23:50.262
Oh, oh, boy. You know, Frank, you know--
you know the thing about you?

23:52.389 --> 23:55.684
Your whole life,
I mean, I always liked you.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
But you never had any closeness.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.605
You never had any love of family.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.565
That's enough, Joe.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.861
Let me and Frank talk, please.

24:10.365 --> 24:11.199
JOE: Yeah.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.285
Sure, Mama.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.333
I found the gun you hid downstairs.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.004
I know you didn't help him.
I know you weren't even here.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.256
But the thing you did, Mama,

24:26.965 --> 24:30.510
hiding the gun and telling them
it was a robbery, that's a crime.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.014
-Do the police--
-No, they don't know.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.190
I came home...

24:44.566 --> 24:46.359
and there he was, slumped in his chair.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.779
He'd been so sick, Frank.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.701
If the police find out,
Father Conklin will find out

24:55.577 --> 24:57.078
and I didn't want Papa to be--

24:57.954 --> 24:59.164
not without a mass.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.291
Not without a blessing at the grave.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.171
Oh, Frank, please. The police can't know.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.048
Please, help me.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.346
Please. (sobbing)

25:20.852 --> 25:21.853
(exhales)

25:25.607 --> 25:26.608
So how was kimchee?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.944
Good. Very tasty.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.154
-How was water?
-Excellent.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.161
Hey, you're not really doing that.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.829
No. No, I'm not, Neal.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.332
I only got 30 bucks
invested in these rodents.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.710
Yeah, and I only got a lifetime
invested in being scared of rats.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.717
Come on. Come on.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.721
Oh, to you, too. Goodbye.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.224
-Excuse me, Detective.
-What is it?

25:59.307 --> 26:01.810
Um, I heard about that phone call
you made this morning.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.895
Forget about that.
That's personal and private.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.022
You know, I know it was personal,
but it was also a very public

26:06.106 --> 26:07.691
and spirited thing to do
and I was wondering

26:07.774 --> 26:10.610
if maybe we could have
a conversation about that.

26:11.069 --> 26:11.903
What's that, Renko?

26:12.320 --> 26:14.906
Well, you see, um, it's like this.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.741
It-it's like where we could go

26:16.825 --> 26:19.327
if-if we just kind of got eye-to-eye
on this sort of thing.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.162
See, I've had those nightmares, too,

26:21.246 --> 26:24.291
where it's too late and things screw up,
missiles are going too fast, see.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.002
So I figure we can get
some kind of a group

26:27.085 --> 26:29.671
like the PBA or something, you know.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.756
People who respect law enforcement.
They don't think we're commies.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.216
Where are you going with this?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.302
Well, we get the PBA
with me as a representative

26:35.385 --> 26:38.221
and we lobby for
some kind of a newspaper ad

26:38.305 --> 26:40.849
that says that everybody
who has had these horrible dreams

26:40.932 --> 26:43.351
to call the White House and-and say,

26:43.435 --> 26:46.146
"Oh, hey, look,
now don't be so macho here."

26:46.396 --> 26:49.190
And then we get this groundswell started

26:49.274 --> 26:50.942
where we get these ads,
like all of a sudden

26:51.026 --> 26:53.445
we have 20 million people
calling the White House

26:53.528 --> 26:55.614
and saying, "Whoa, slow the bus down."

26:55.697 --> 26:58.617
Look, look, I already got a career.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.994
This was personal and private.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.747
Personal? Well, okay,
you think about it, okay? Okay.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.958
I'm thinking about it.
I wish I could stop thinking about it.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.045
Mick, this is Mr. Darnell Karns.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.047
He is the father of the missing baby.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.548
Where's my child, Timothy?

27:14.507 --> 27:15.717
You're that kid's father?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.053
You abandoned your son?

27:18.136 --> 27:19.971
You don't talk to me like that, you hear?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.349
His mother took him.
I don't know what she did.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.351
All right, come here.
Come with me. Come on.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.440
I come back at 12:00
to see the child and they're both gone.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.902
If you weren't working
for the last three days, where were you?

27:33.985 --> 27:36.071
-Why is that a question?
-Because.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.657
You come down here
saying you had nothing to do with it.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.325
Who are you, Mr. Clean?

27:41.701 --> 27:43.078
Look, I was in jail, all right?

27:44.704 --> 27:46.247
Look here. Here.

27:47.040 --> 27:47.874
Here's my papers.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.836
-Out at 11:45.
-What were you in jail for?

27:51.920 --> 27:54.881
Come on, man. That's what it's about?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.217
Are you gonna take my child for that?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.552
Would you answer my questions?

28:02.430 --> 28:03.682
I was in a fight, all right?

28:05.225 --> 28:08.561
I was driving my taxi,
a dude remarks me that he wants to duke.

28:10.438 --> 28:14.651
Look, man, you took my child
and you brought my child in here.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.278
-Where is he at?
-Mr. Karns.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.740
This is a telephone number
for the Youth Authority.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.869
It's the Dekker Avenue branch.
Mrs. Morgenstern.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.621
DARNELL: Youth Authority? Why is he there?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.374
Because he is.
That's where they take lost babies.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.127
Now you go over there,
talk it out with them.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.212
Youth Authority, huh?

28:35.588 --> 28:37.841
They're gonna ask me
about a lousy three days

28:37.924 --> 28:39.801
when I ain't been in jail in eight years.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.138
I don't know what they're gonna ask,
Mr. Karns. Now go.

28:46.099 --> 28:46.933
All right.

28:48.977 --> 28:49.978
He needs me now.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.898
Little guy ain't got to be afraid.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.494
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
You can tell me to shut up,

29:06.578 --> 29:09.914
but I understand your captain
has a loved one who is gravely ill.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.458
Where'd you hear that?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.835
Actually, I overheard you on the horn.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.546
If you see him, will you tell him
we offer very competitive pricing

29:16.629 --> 29:18.506
and could you pass along
one of our brochures?

29:18.590 --> 29:19.507
He's out of town.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.928
It happened out of town.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.688
I can't stand to see you
hurt yourself like this.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.834
He's barricaded the door
and making a lot of noise,

30:35.917 --> 30:37.627
but he doesn't seem to be threatening.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.712
-Where's the baby?
-The other room.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.339
Refused to bring it,
that's when he started yelling for it.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.175
Okay, go get the baby
and hang out in the back.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.093
All right.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.762
Mr. Karns, detective Belker.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.305
Right away, just like I told you,

30:49.389 --> 30:51.182
they started talking
about how I'd been in jail.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.434
Never mind jail now, Mr. Karns.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.562
Now we're talking about taking hostages.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.982
Nobody gives a baby
to a guy who takes hostages.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.235
-It's my baby.
-He's not the legal guardian.

31:02.318 --> 31:05.822
-We offered him a ten-day hearing date.
-Okay, okay.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.283
How about this?

31:09.450 --> 31:12.161
I'm not taking sides. I'm not.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.080
I'm talking to both of you.

31:14.163 --> 31:16.416
Let's say they bring the baby now.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.877
You can hold him, make sure he's okay,

31:18.960 --> 31:23.131
if you open this door
and let out the hostages.

31:23.381 --> 31:27.176
Then we can sit down,
we can talk this thing through.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.013
If I do that, can I take Timothy home?

31:30.096 --> 31:30.930
MICK: No.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.310
But if you don't let those women go,
you're never gonna have him.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.770
Look, don't mislead him.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.105
His chances are about zilch.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.524
Now, this is the kind of comment
we don't need.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.693
-That's not our policy.
-Go ahead, give it to him.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.362
When he tries to leave with that baby,
it's child endangerment.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.948
-You're off the case, Harvey.
-Watch out. Coming through.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.666
Just take it easy, now, man.
Don't do anything strange, all right?

32:03.796 --> 32:06.090
Hey. Hey, how you doing?

32:06.174 --> 32:09.010
Say cheese. How you doing, big cheese?

32:09.344 --> 32:10.178
Huh?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.805
Oh, Daddy loves you.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.436
Captain, a minute of your time?

32:18.853 --> 32:21.356
If you'll give me a second
to just check up on my mother.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.859
She's sleeping now.
The doctor mildly sedated her.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.487
Lieutenant, I'll return later.

32:28.029 --> 32:28.863
Thank you, Father.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.448
Father.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.034
-What?
-Alone.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.537
I'll make some more coffee.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.127
I talked to your mother
a few minutes about insurance.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.879
She assured me there isn't any.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.006
Why did you ask?

32:47.799 --> 32:52.095
Your father's death,
we now believe was a suicide, Captain.

32:52.762 --> 32:55.348
Sorry, you surprised by what I'm saying?

32:56.432 --> 32:57.433
No, not really.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.436
-You know your dad was very sick?
-Found out today.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.730
See, we weren't getting anywhere
on the robbery supposition.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.775
Not a piece of dirt even.
Then O'Malley finds a handful of bullets,

33:05.858 --> 33:07.777
same bullet that killed him, in a shoebox.

33:08.236 --> 33:11.406
O'Malley wasn't prying around, Captain.
It was part of his floor sweep.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.075
He find a gun?

33:15.368 --> 33:18.162
Uh-uh.
We thought maybe your mom got hinky,

33:18.246 --> 33:20.039
threw it out, but it's not in the garbage.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.166
Then we thought
maybe she'd hide it down here.

33:23.042 --> 33:23.960
Seems logical.

33:25.044 --> 33:25.878
It's not here.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.966
You didn't come down before,
did you, Captain?

33:31.384 --> 33:32.385
Actually, I did.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.846
Yeah, O'Malley thought
he saw you coming down here.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.639
You weren't looking
for something, were you?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.557
Why?

33:38.558 --> 33:39.392
Gun?

33:43.187 --> 33:44.939
Guess cops think along the same lines.

33:46.024 --> 33:46.858
Did you find it?

33:48.192 --> 33:49.027
No.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.237
Well, don't worry.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.238
Without the gun...

33:53.406 --> 33:55.450
even if my commander
gets a bee in his bonnet,

33:56.826 --> 33:58.369
we're not going after
your mother for anything.

34:14.469 --> 34:15.762
Oh, Frank.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.597
Mama.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.017
I threw out the gun.

34:21.809 --> 34:24.312
But the police know what happened.
They found out anyway.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.189
Y-you threw out the gun?

34:27.815 --> 34:29.067
I made you do something bad.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.402
You shouldn't say that.
You needn't and you shouldn't.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.529
I made the mistake
and you covered up for me.

34:34.363 --> 34:37.575
-It's done.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.665
Papa was so proud of you
when you graduated from police academy.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.417
Do you know that?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.961
All I ever heard was how little money
I was gonna make.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.130
He was proud.

34:51.923 --> 34:55.051
A man as proud as your father
doesn't even like to show his pride.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.971
And he hasn't passed on a day that I--

35:00.473 --> 35:02.767
I made you do something
a policeman shouldn't do.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.647
Is Father Conklin still out there?

35:07.980 --> 35:10.691
He said he'll come by later.
Did you hear what I said before?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.362
The police found out what happened.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.489
I heard.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.701
What's gonna happen?

35:21.661 --> 35:22.662
I'll talk to them.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.668
JOYCE:
And give him the German on Costello.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.378
-Lieutenant.
-What you got?

35:31.754 --> 35:33.714
Even better. Who didn't show, Buntz?

35:34.799 --> 35:36.634
Make sure it's charged to the DA.

35:37.301 --> 35:38.678
Okay, I'll call you back later.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.640
You're sure there's no insurance kicking
around here somewhere?

35:42.723 --> 35:45.893
Just his company retirement
and that's paid up no matter how he died.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.562
You know, if I do this,

35:48.020 --> 35:50.273
what you're asking,
it goes in as an open case.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.942
That doesn't help
my batting average, Captain.

35:53.442 --> 35:56.237
-Or my precinct's either.
-I'm asking a favor.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.116
I have no call except one cop to another.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.163
Your dad ain't gonna go to hell.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.249
Your dad's a clean guy everything I heard.

36:15.923 --> 36:16.799
Status...

36:20.928 --> 36:21.762
open.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.602
Better hope that gun don't turn up
underneath the bed.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.728
It won't.

36:29.937 --> 36:30.855
That's what I figured.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.233
Thank you.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.613
You're gonna tell the truth.

36:39.488 --> 36:40.781
-You gonna tell the man the truth.
-No.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.700
-I didn't bring you down here for nothing.
-No!

36:42.783 --> 36:43.743
Here's the man now!

36:43.826 --> 36:45.703
-You tell him what went down!
-Stand over here.

36:45.786 --> 36:47.330
I hung around her building
and she came back.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.832
-Now go on, Corinne.
-I didn't have no money!

36:49.916 --> 36:52.418
-Darnell didn't send none.
-Is that what you're gonna tell him?

36:52.501 --> 36:53.961
Huh? When you spent it all on dope?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.881
Tell the truth! Tell him, Corinne!
Tell the truth!

36:56.964 --> 36:59.508
I knew there was people in that building!
(crying)

37:00.760 --> 37:02.929
I left him, but I came back.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.472
You left your baby?

37:04.805 --> 37:07.308
But I came back.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.854
You're under arrest. Officer.

37:12.438 --> 37:15.524
Search this woman and book her
for felony child endangerment. Go on.

37:15.983 --> 37:18.236
Let him go. You can let him go.
He's all right now.

37:20.363 --> 37:23.157
Mr. Karns. Mr. Karns, sit down, please.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.284
You all right?

37:25.952 --> 37:28.579
Listen, I checked the cab company.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.914
You got a good record.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.666
Told you so.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.542
So, at least I can tell them that, huh.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.753
Am I gonna get my baby?

37:36.212 --> 37:37.546
My sister will be here on Friday.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.924
Mr. Karns, I don't know the answer
to those things.

37:40.007 --> 37:42.635
Um, um, that's not my job.
I'm only the cop.

37:44.887 --> 37:45.721
Yeah.

37:48.057 --> 37:48.891
See you.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.978
What's gonna be with her?

37:53.062 --> 37:56.023
Probably, she'll get out.
Probably, she'll get a legal aid

37:56.107 --> 37:58.234
just like you did
and she'll contest the proceedings.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.902
-Probably.
-Yeah.

38:00.569 --> 38:01.821
Well, anyway, thanks.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.031
You're the only one who stood up for me.

38:04.573 --> 38:05.408
You're welcome.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.538
Henry, Mr. Chun.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.331
I know Mr. Chun.

38:12.415 --> 38:15.835
You happy now?
Cop can park in lot anytime cop want.

38:17.169 --> 38:19.505
Mr. Chun,
this is a health department citation.

38:19.588 --> 38:20.881
It's got nothing to do with us.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.510
I know my health inspector very well.
My health inspector no make this problem.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.263
I've got to tell you, sir.

38:27.346 --> 38:29.890
If you're saying
you paid off your regular health inspector

38:29.974 --> 38:32.727
and now you're got a new honest one
and that's why you got nailed,

38:32.810 --> 38:35.938
that's a very corrupt,
un-American attitude.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.190
Eat maggot until you die.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.777
I talked to Chanders over at First Strike.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.905
So we may be neighbors.
Forget World War III.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.408
We could get up there
for deer hunting season.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.410
Neighbors, sneighbors. Deer, shmeer.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.204
I'm the new sales rep
of the entire eastern district.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.583
And I got you to thank
for my midlife career move, Sergeant.

38:56.208 --> 39:00.004
Yes siree, this AM mortise
was a journeyman dragging his tail

39:00.087 --> 39:01.922
through the listless seas
of a time honored

39:02.006 --> 39:03.799
yet no growth industry.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.260
This evening, take a look at this.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.597
Mother Nature may get mugged,
but you'll have yours.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.017
Dipping in the jacuzzi,
dining on your cuisine nouvelle,

39:13.100 --> 39:15.186
a thousand feet beneath the fuss.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.021
Damn, it's a vital product.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.154
Excuse me. I'm Detective Belker.

39:25.237 --> 39:27.323
I'm doing some investigating
on a custody case.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.991
I'd like some Xeroxes made, please.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.201
-Detective.
-Yes?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.828
-Could I see you for a moment, please?
-Sure.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.964
I know you've taken an interest
in the Karns case.

39:44.048 --> 39:47.093
So before you spend any more time on it,
I want to let you know where we stand.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.470
Good. Where do we stand?

39:50.346 --> 39:52.098
There's been tremendous negative reaction

39:52.181 --> 39:54.308
up and down the floor
to the hostage taking.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.019
Ms. Forbes is devastated.
She's asking for work leave.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.730
And so Mr. Karns
is not going to get his child?

40:00.022 --> 40:02.400
A family court judge
will make that decision, of course.

40:02.483 --> 40:06.362
But your recommendation will be no,
and the judge follows your recommendation.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.823
Most of the time.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.286
I just thought he was
an okay guy, Mr. Karns.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.790
He wasn't that okay.
We have records going back.

40:17.873 --> 40:19.333
Child support was always spotty

40:19.417 --> 40:22.628
and up until eight years ago,
he had a record of violent crimes.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.255
Timothy goes to a foster home then?

40:25.506 --> 40:26.590
Yes, for six months.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.384
Maybe a year,
and then there'll be another hearing set.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.552
His mother is a doper.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.471
His father may not
last six months or a year.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.640
You're the one who said
he was okay, Detective.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.768
He is okay. He is on the edge.

40:38.477 --> 40:40.563
Why can't you understand that?

40:42.064 --> 40:43.315
We do our best.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.322
We'll be at the motel, Joe.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.242
Frank, I owe you an apology.

40:54.326 --> 40:56.787
That thing about the family
not being not being a part.

40:56.871 --> 40:57.913
It's just...

40:59.331 --> 41:00.374
it's a lot of stuff.

41:02.668 --> 41:03.961
I'm glad you're here.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.881
I love you, Joey.

41:15.556 --> 41:16.765
Look at your daddy.

41:20.144 --> 41:23.481
-How is bibimbap?
-Oh, very good. This is excellent.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.525
-(burps)
-Thanks.

41:28.527 --> 41:31.155
-This is terrible.
-Mr. Community Relations.

41:31.238 --> 41:32.072
(chuckles)

41:32.865 --> 41:34.241
Hey, you know where your dream came from,

41:34.325 --> 41:35.701
-don't you?
-Where?

41:35.784 --> 41:38.245
Well, we started watching a show
last night about Hiroshima.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.581
Uh-uh, I fell asleep
right when it came on.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.625
Yeah, but I bet your brain absorbed it.

41:42.708 --> 41:45.336
People do that. You know, they're still
hearing when they drop off.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.631
At least it's going away now.
The anxiety is a lot less.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.257
Yeah, well, look at it this way.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.510
You didn't save the world today.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.386
-(Phillip cackles)
-But you saved a kid.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.892
You're right. That's kind of dumb.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.019
You know, I almost lost that kid.

42:02.311 --> 42:05.523
'Cause I didn't think.
It was like I was all screwed up.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.569
Honey, could I hold on to Phillip?

42:10.653 --> 42:12.863
Come on. Go see your daddy.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.616
Oh. Oh, boy.

42:22.248 --> 42:25.292
You know, I-I don't even know
what's gonna happen to that other kid.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.841
-Mick, stop.
-Stop what?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.135
Well, you're playing footsie.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.470
I'm not.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.557
-You're not?
-No.

42:39.848 --> 42:41.100
(screams)

42:44.812 --> 42:46.397
You're a felon, Furillo.

42:48.607 --> 42:50.943
Ma Barker's boys did it for their mom.

42:53.028 --> 42:54.363
Furillo did it for his.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.658
That my defense?

42:58.742 --> 42:59.577
Sure.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.788
-Will you retain me?
-You bet.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.338
My father was a stiff, cold man and I am.

43:12.089 --> 43:12.923
Aren't I?

43:14.925 --> 43:16.510
You want the answer to be yes?

43:20.222 --> 43:21.140
You aren't.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.226
You aren't your father.

43:26.353 --> 43:28.439
Joey wanted to be just like our dad.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.984
You know how some kids are?

43:32.776 --> 43:33.986
Their old man's a god.

43:36.655 --> 43:38.949
That was Joey his whole life.

43:42.578 --> 43:43.871
But he was too sweet.

43:45.289 --> 43:46.915
I was closer to the mold.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.710
(phone rings)

43:51.086 --> 43:53.297
Hello. Henry.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.132
I just called to check in.

43:56.842 --> 43:57.718
How'd it go?

44:00.054 --> 44:01.305
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.309
Yes, he passed on this morning.

44:06.685 --> 44:07.686
No, they didn't.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.148
No, it was... (voice breaks)

44:11.774 --> 44:12.691
suicide.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.989
Right, he was very sick.
He was dying of cancer.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.449
And apparently...

44:22.951 --> 44:23.786
Yeah.

44:25.871 --> 44:26.705
Thank you.

44:27.873 --> 44:28.707
Good night.

44:39.551 --> 44:42.346
Frank. Will you not be angry with me?

44:45.641 --> 44:47.434
Before when Christina called,

44:48.769 --> 44:50.688
you know she was in convent a year.

44:50.771 --> 44:51.605
Mm-hmm.

44:52.564 --> 44:54.024
I asked her a few things.

44:56.735 --> 44:59.988
She said you could get
a-a cranky old priest,

45:01.281 --> 45:02.866
but mostly these days,

45:04.118 --> 45:05.536
the church considers your whole life.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.663
They don't condemn you for suicide.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.790
-They don't?
-Mm-mm.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.877
-You know why?
-No.

45:17.631 --> 45:18.716
I thought it was...

45:20.092 --> 45:21.301
kind of beautiful.

45:24.012 --> 45:25.431
Because imagine...

45:27.057 --> 45:28.809
a man jumps off a building.

45:30.352 --> 45:32.646
Before he hits the ground,
we'll never know for sure,

45:32.730 --> 45:34.523
but he might have had a second thought.

45:37.693 --> 45:38.527
I like that.

45:50.205 --> 45:51.999
DOCTOR: <i>The tumor is situated here</i>

45:52.416 --> 45:54.877
where I'm afraid surgery is not an option.

45:59.423 --> 46:00.883
No cure?

46:01.175 --> 46:04.094
Radiation therapy, chemotherapy.

46:05.387 --> 46:07.598
Mr. Furillo, there will be pain.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.267
We'll do our best with it.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.728
Radiation therapy.

46:14.229 --> 46:15.397
Chemotherapy.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.901
Do our best with the pain.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.254
(circus music playing)

46:45.719 --> 46:46.595
(giggling)

46:58.982 --> 47:01.443
(phone rings)

47:01.985 --> 47:03.237
(sighs) Hello.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.988
RONALD REAGAN (on phone): <i>Mick, hi.</i>

47:05.072 --> 47:06.240
<i>It's the president.</i>

47:06.532 --> 47:08.826
-Mr. President?
<i>-Right.</i>

47:08.909 --> 47:10.452
<i>Mick, I got your message.</i>

47:10.536 --> 47:12.454
<i>You were right to remind me, Mick.</i>

47:12.538 --> 47:15.666
<i>We're going to destroy</i>
<i>all the nuclear bombs.</i>

47:15.749 --> 47:17.000
<i>It's high time.</i>

47:17.334 --> 47:19.878
<i>We're making them into old Studebakers.</i>

47:20.587 --> 47:22.589
<i>God, I love those cars.</i>

47:22.965 --> 47:25.968
<i>The whole country thanks you</i>
<i>for your suggestion, Mick.</i>

47:42.734 --> 47:45.737
(closing theme playing)
