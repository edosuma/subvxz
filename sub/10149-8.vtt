01:06.484 --> 01:07.985
<i>Previously</i> on Batman Beyond...

01:08.194 --> 01:10.863
I think it's time your protege
joined the Justice League.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.990
<i>I've considered them heroes
my Whole life.</i>

01:13.532 --> 01:15.034
<i>How can one of them be a traitor?</i>

01:17.745 --> 01:18.745
Oh, no.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.167
Superman's the traitor.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.795
Kryptonite.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.505
Do whatever it takes,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.757
but make sure you stop him.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.401
I don't believe it.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.152
It is hard to accept, Barda, but...

01:50.236 --> 01:52.655
No, I mean, I don't believe this thing.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.740
It came straight off
the Batmobile's recorder.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.575
And that's supposed to convince me?

01:56.659 --> 01:59.620
I know even less about your vehicle
than I do about you.

01:59.829 --> 02:02.039
What reason would I have
to make up any of this?

02:02.248 --> 02:04.917
What reason would Superman have
to kill Warhawk?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.545
It's easier for me
to believe you fabricated this.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.964
Listen, lady. I never asked
to be part of this club.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.257
You people came to me.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.801
It was only Superman who came to you.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.803
And now you're accusing him of murder.

02:15.886 --> 02:16.886
It doesn't make sense.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.055
I know it doesn't.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.700
But we're never gonna
get to the bottom of it

02:19.724 --> 02:22.226
unless you open your eyes
and stop being so pigheaded.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.310
Pigheaded?

02:34.071 --> 02:35.406
Let go of me, Lantern!

02:35.573 --> 02:37.408
Not until you calm down.

02:38.034 --> 02:39.827
Yeah, Barda, calm down.

02:40.036 --> 02:41.120
The kid's right.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.789
Warhawk!

02:47.543 --> 02:48.544
How did you...

02:48.627 --> 02:49.879
I wasn't in the armor.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.881
I was operating it by remote.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.175
That's the only reason
I'm not dust right now.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.426
Very shrewd.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.634
Not like you.

02:56.761 --> 02:57.762
Tell me something.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.805
What made you decide
to get out of the armor?

02:59.889 --> 03:01.098
The emergency call.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.892
And me being the only one who got it.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.703
With everything
that had been happening around here,

03:04.727 --> 03:05.811
I got suspicious.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.272
I told him not to tag along,
but he disobeyed.

03:08.773 --> 03:09.774
I like that.

03:10.983 --> 03:13.277
We must talk to Superman immediately.

03:13.444 --> 03:16.155
You can talk. I got other plans for him.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.115
We have to give him a chance to explain.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.408
He deserves that much.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.452
Fine, let him explain.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.204
And then I'll rip his arms off.

03:43.641 --> 03:44.725
Superman!

03:47.186 --> 03:48.854
Warhawk. You're all right.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.148
No thanks to you.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.525
Not yet.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.276
What's going on?

03:54.527 --> 03:56.237
We were hoping you could tell us, Kal.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.807
Starting with what you were doing
just now when we came in.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.117
I was adjusting Micron's stasis field.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.660
Sorry to be contentious,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.121
but that stasis field
never needs adjustment.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.872
It runs on Micron's biofeedback.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.500
So what were you
really trying to do, hero?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.210
Finish him off like you tried with me?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.979
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.964
But I do know there's a traitor here,

04:15.047 --> 04:16.841
and I've been trying
to find out who it is.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.217
That's why I brought him in.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.802
You did bring me in.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.369
But that doesn't make you innocent.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.390
Now I understand.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.076
It wasn't one of you
that betrayed the League.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.143
It was all of you.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.686
You're all traitors.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.563
Kal, you know I'd never betray you.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.898
Or anyone else
who's ever fought at my side.

04:32.982 --> 04:33.982
But something's wrong.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.568
Nothing's wrong.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.570
Please, let us help.

04:38.696 --> 04:39.696
{933931

04:42.950 --> 04:43.950
Look out!

05:02.052 --> 05:03.137
Aah!

05:04.138 --> 05:05.138
No!

05:09.560 --> 05:10.603
Get down!

05:16.942 --> 05:19.361
The one person I thought I could trust.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.620
Aah!

05:38.964 --> 05:39.965
Aah!

06:03.197 --> 06:05.074
I only made contact with him
for a second,

06:05.157 --> 06:06.909
but I got such a weird feeling.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.702
It was that thing on his chest.

06:08.786 --> 06:09.954
It had to have been.

06:10.079 --> 06:12.122
If only I had another second or two.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.668
The kryptonite
was two inches from my hand,

06:15.793 --> 06:17.002
but I hesitated.

06:17.086 --> 06:17.920
<i>Why?</i>

06:18.003 --> 06:20.297
The guy's the greatest hero
who ever lived.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.924
Uh, one of the greatest.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.694
<i>I figured there had to be another way.</i>

06:23.801 --> 06:25.052
But now you know better.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.804
There's nothing about him on the news.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.888
No sightings.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.807
Bet he's gone to that fortress of his.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.183
That would be logical.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.935
But what good is that to us?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.580
How are we gonna fight him
if we don't know where his fortress is?

06:35.604 --> 06:36.897
I think I can help.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.608
You know where
the Fortress of Solitude is?

06:39.942 --> 06:40.859
No.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.111
But I know someone who does.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.929
So much for the element of surprise.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.020
Perhaps he is not here.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.022
Or maybe he's setting a trap for us.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.273
Right this minute.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.317
I say we find him first.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
I second that.

07:32.703 --> 07:33.871
Whoa.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.417
What's that, his pet?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.419
No, I think this is more like a zoo.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.879
He once told me about...

07:41.962 --> 07:43.172
Over here.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.385
Something got out.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.846
- What do you think it was?
- No way to tell.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.182
Maybe there wasn't anything
in here to begin with.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.892
There was something in here, all right.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.226
You see those blue things?

07:57.770 --> 07:58.687
What is it, food?

07:58.771 --> 07:59.771
Used to be.

08:00.606 --> 08:01.606
Ugh!

08:02.983 --> 08:03.984
Look!

08:16.955 --> 08:17.955
A robot.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.009
Behind you!

08:37.059 --> 08:38.727
You are green.

08:39.645 --> 08:40.688
Join the club.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.703
Good work, kid.

08:55.786 --> 08:56.954
Now finish him off.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.832
No. We need to see
what that thing on his chest is.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.133
Lantern, Barda,

09:09.216 --> 09:11.176
you two have been around
the galaxy once or twice,

09:11.260 --> 09:12.720
ever see anything like this?

09:12.803 --> 09:13.803
Never.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.726
Whatever it is,

09:19.017 --> 09:21.562
it appears to have somehow
embedded itself in his skin.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.188
Any chance of getting it off?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.648
I must remind you,

09:24.732 --> 09:28.068
this is not just one alien species
before us, it's two,

09:28.152 --> 09:31.405
and I do not yet understand
the subtleties of their interaction.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.490
I'll take that as an "I don't know."

09:38.829 --> 09:40.069
What do you think you're doing?

09:40.164 --> 09:43.500
I'm trying to see what's going on
in the mind of this thing.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.252
I'm the only one who can do it.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.510
It's very old.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.761
Centuries.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.930
It came from a world of water.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.682
It didn't leave by choice.

10:22.873 --> 10:26.293
<i>The creature had never seen
anything like the traveler's vehicle.</i>

10:26.668 --> 10:30.547
<i>It never occurred to him to be afraid
until it was too late.</i>

10:39.431 --> 10:42.392
<i>He soon realized
that the traveler was a collector.</i>

10:42.643 --> 10:46.146
<i>A preserver of different species
from all over the universe.</i>

10:46.563 --> 10:48.482
<i>The last of their kind.</i>

10:51.735 --> 10:54.196
<i>Time and again
the creature tried to escape.</i>

10:54.905 --> 10:56.025
<i>But it wasn't strong enough.</i>

11:01.578 --> 11:02.996
<i>Years passed.</i>

11:03.372 --> 11:05.582
<i>The preserver grew overconfident.</i>

11:05.666 --> 11:09.044
<i>He took someone into his zoo
who was too strong even for him.</i>

11:09.503 --> 11:10.921
<i>It was Superman.</i>

11:31.108 --> 11:34.194
<i>Superman had no way to return
the creatures to their home planets,</i>

11:34.278 --> 11:36.947
<i>so he kept them here on Earth
at his fortress.</i>

11:39.867 --> 11:42.870
<i>The creature was still a prisoner,
but now he had a plan.</i>

11:43.412 --> 11:45.455
<i>He'd seen how strong Superman was,</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:47.457
<i>and he wanted that strength for himself.</i>

12:05.350 --> 12:07.019
It took over Superman's mind.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.646
- It's been on him for years.
- Years?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.899
Then Why'd it wait
so long to try to kill us?

12:12.107 --> 12:14.026
Because it has bigger plans.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.492
Controlling Superman
wasn't enough for the creature.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.661
It wanted the whole world.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.330
But it couldn't do it on its own.

12:35.339 --> 12:38.008
He was using Superman to help him
cultivate these things.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.211
Looks like they were
gonna be released into the ocean.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.261
And once they were out,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.388
it wouldn't be long
before they'd take over.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.889
What do think, Barda?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.392
Poison? Heat? Electricity?

12:47.476 --> 12:49.353
Or do we stick with
the old fashion ways?

12:49.561 --> 12:50.729
I have a better idea.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.678
Barda, give it to me.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.326
You gotta fight this thing, all of you!

13:46.702 --> 13:48.495
You can't let it control you.

13:48.996 --> 13:49.996
Aquagirl!

13:50.205 --> 13:51.206
Barda!

14:15.147 --> 14:16.189
<i>Everything okay?</i>

14:16.440 --> 14:17.566
Not really.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.192
But thanks for sending my ride for me.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.028
<i>I never did like those boom tubes.</i>

14:23.447 --> 14:25.407
And now those starfish things
are on all of them.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.490
Any ideas?

14:26.575 --> 14:28.994
All I can do is
have Barbara contact the military.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.241
<i>But they'll bomb the place.</i>

14:30.579 --> 14:31.830
<i>That's the“ sob.</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:36.769
What's the top speed on this thing?

14:36.793 --> 14:37.793
<i>Mach three.</i>

14:37.836 --> 14:39.356
Is that faster than a speeding bullet?

15:30.514 --> 15:32.557
There's no way out of this
for you, Batman.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.775
Come, be part of us.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.777
Soon it'll be our world.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.363
No, thanks.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.397
What's going on?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.107
You don't remember?

16:23.859 --> 16:24.693
No.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.420
I'll explain on the way
back to the fortress.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.444
Think you can still fly?

16:28.572 --> 16:30.448
Yeah. But what's that doing here?

16:30.615 --> 16:31.700
Staying put for now.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.085
This pool feeds directly
into the water below the ice cap.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.671
There's a steel door down there
blocking the passage.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.423
Can you open it by yourself?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.051
Superman.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.721
- Is he with us?
- Not yet.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.514
We can fix that.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.098
Wait.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.475
Something's not right.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.394
- Put him down.
- Of course.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.024
Aah!

17:55.325 --> 17:56.451
Kal, what are you doing?

17:56.534 --> 17:57.953
Aquagirl must've opened the gate.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.788
I've got to block it.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.584
But Batman's down there.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.169
He knew what he was getting into.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.462
Where should I boom them to?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.255
Some empty galaxy?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.174
Or maybe the surface of the sun?

19:34.466 --> 19:36.676
Barda, these creatures
never asked to come here.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.136
We have no right to kill them.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.512
Back to his old self again.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.848
We should send them home.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.391
But how do we know
where that is?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.944
Barda, let me see your Mother Box.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.254
Well, kid, I gotta admit,
I was wrong about you.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.839
An understatement.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.091
He saved the world.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.759
Think you can get used to it?

20:18.009 --> 20:19.928
You're saying you want me
with you full-time?

20:20.011 --> 20:21.471
We could really use you.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.056
I don't know.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.641
You guys play awfully rough.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.352
Come on, it'll put you
one up on the old Batman.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.937
He never made it past part-timer.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.856
Yeah. He wasn't
what you'd call a joiner.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.651
Maybe he and I have
something in common after all.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.156
More than you think, son.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.574
More than you think.
