WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.235
.

00:07.807 --> 00:09.576
Geordie Shore is back.

00:09.642 --> 00:12.078
What the hell is gonna happen
this time?

00:12.145 --> 00:14.180
Geordie Tours.
Where?

00:14.247 --> 00:15.882
Across Europe.
Yes!

00:15.949 --> 00:18.718
(girls) What happens on tour
stays on tour.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.787
Bring on the fucking carnage.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.255
(cheering)

00:22.322 --> 00:25.091
What has happened to Charlotte?
I am in control.

00:26.092 --> 00:29.429
Goodbye sex with Gary,
we're coming home.

00:29.496 --> 00:33.867
Charlotte and Holly are the Cock
Capturers an excuse for being slags.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.937
Against the Buck Squad Hope Charlotte
doesn't shit herself. (farts)

00:38.004 --> 00:39.406
There's fucking fireworks.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.608
(smash!)
That's what you said to me!

00:43.743 --> 00:46.212
We'll never ever be friends again.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.882
Me and Gary
think we're in Amsterdam. Fuck,

00:48.948 --> 00:50.350
this isn't Amsterdam.

00:51.751 --> 00:52.786
Rarrrrrrr!

00:54.354 --> 00:56.489
I should have a degree in pulling.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.758
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.094
If you look up pulling,
my name's there.

01:01.161 --> 01:03.263
I never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:03.329 --> 01:05.131
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:05.197 --> 01:09.102
I could talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, the charm.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.771
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.807
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.075
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:37.130 --> 01:41.100
We're working for Anna showing stag
and hens how to party across Europe.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.436
(phone rings)

01:44.771 --> 01:46.439
Hi, it's Scott.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.442
What's the crack?

01:54.848 --> 01:55.949
Ah, mint.

01:56.015 --> 02:00.720
She's sending me and the whole
crew to fucking Prague to work.

02:07.894 --> 02:12.465
We're back on tour, this time Prague.
I've heard of it like.

02:12.532 --> 02:16.035
I don't have a clue where Prague is.
Prague's in Germany.

02:18.671 --> 02:19.839
Is it in Holland?

02:21.307 --> 02:25.011
Sex, drink and boob jobs. Holly,
you should be in your element.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.680
Strip clubs, girls, beers, stag do.

02:27.747 --> 02:33.419
Cheap beer, wicked clubs, blow jobs,
everything Geordie Shore loves.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.756
What fucking better place
to send me?

02:36.823 --> 02:39.492
Wicked.
Fucking bring it on.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.574
21.8, how many are you allowed?
Get in.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.251
We need to know where the clubs and
birds are and where we're staying.

03:05.318 --> 03:09.455
I wanna find out how you say,
"Drop your pants" in Praguish.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.525
Anything else can jog on.
Scran.

03:12.592 --> 03:18.798
# "One More Night" - Maroon 5

03:25.471 --> 03:28.908
So we get to Prague,
it's fucking freezing. Apparently,

03:28.975 --> 03:30.977
it's one degree.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.245
(growls)

03:32.312 --> 03:37.116
Mother nature has give us one degree
to play with and she takes that

03:37.183 --> 03:41.287
off us at night cos it's minus one.
What a fucking bitch.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.189
I'm still not wearing a coat.

03:43.256 --> 03:48.127
Oi, oi, this is fucking swagger pad.

03:49.228 --> 03:51.397
Fucking hell, this is all right.

03:51.464 --> 03:55.468
Got this fucking swanky apartment.
Hoy all the girls in one room.

03:55.535 --> 03:59.305
Vicky and Ricci in their little
couple room. Ahhh. It's gorgeous.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.807
Isn't it cute?

04:00.873 --> 04:05.778
The lads just go wherever
the fuck you want as girls come. Yes!

04:05.845 --> 04:10.917
What if Gary comes back,
sticks his cock in some random girl

04:10.984 --> 04:15.321
and I can hear the moans?
Or the squelching of the wet fanny?

04:15.388 --> 04:18.156
I'll have to cry myself to sleep!

04:24.430 --> 04:26.699
Thank fuck, it's too late to work.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.169
We're gonna go out, see what
these Praguish men are about.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.606
(cheering)

04:33.673 --> 04:38.344
I can't wait to go out and smash it
Prague-style featuring Scotty T.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.046
Oh, my God.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.049
It's fucking Baltic but who cares?

04:52.325 --> 04:56.362
As if it's not fucking cold enough,
we're going to an ice bar.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.935
They make us dress like twats. Like
an astronaut in a puffer jacket.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.103
Wicked!

05:04.170 --> 05:10.176
Ice absolutely everywhere, ice bar,
ice cups, ice cubes, ice walls.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.246
This is fucking icy.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.985
Knock it back.
(chanting) Vicky, Vicky, Vicky!

05:19.052 --> 05:22.288
We've got vodka in our glasses,
vodka in our hands,

05:22.355 --> 05:24.157
vodka coming out of our eyeballs.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.460
I'm just thinking,
"Fuck, I'm carrying them home later."

05:27.527 --> 05:29.896
(shouting)

05:33.032 --> 05:37.370
We're hitting the second club and it
gets complicated for me and Gary.

05:37.437 --> 05:41.374
We slept together in Amsterdam
and we did the same in Newcastle.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.043
I'm so worried
it's gonna happen again.

05:44.110 --> 05:47.447
# "Baiya" - Delphic

05:47.513 --> 05:49.882
I wanna do my own thing and pull

05:49.949 --> 05:53.886
but you've got your ex living with
you. You don't wanna hurt her

05:53.953 --> 05:56.489
but you end up sleeping with them
when you're pissed.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.626
Come on then.

06:00.693 --> 06:07.767
# "Million Voices" - Otto Knows

06:14.707 --> 06:19.011
The club is full of boys,
it's ten boys to every one girl.

06:19.078 --> 06:23.382
So it's only right that boys
want to chat me and Holly up

06:23.449 --> 06:25.384
cos we're looking so damn hot.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.927
It doesn't take long before Gaz and
Scotty are over cock-blocking them.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.731
I know he's jealous
so I'm gonna go and help him out.

06:48.407 --> 06:53.112
Thanks, Gary, do I do this to you?
Probablys but it doesn't matter.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.824
They don't want anyone else
to have them.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.394
It's as if they don't want
to scupper their back-up plans.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.972
We look at the dance floor
and there's lads having a dance-off.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.809
So Scotty T is gonna be
like John Travolta

07:22.875 --> 07:25.044
and rock the fucking dance floor.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.648
(shouting)

07:30.850 --> 07:34.053
And he's jumping.
He's like Bambi on ice.

07:35.988 --> 07:39.392
Halfway through dancing I get
this weird feeling in me crotch.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.298
I've ripped me fucking jeans.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.365
What a tit.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.635
Nightmare.

07:56.609 --> 08:01.047
We go to leave the club
and we're just waiting for Gaz.

08:02.448 --> 08:05.051
It's all right for Gary to pull

08:05.117 --> 08:08.287
but when I wanna pull
it's cock-block central.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.356
This is a fucking joke.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.929
"Gaz, we've got to go..."
It's Charlotte.

08:23.736 --> 08:27.974
Gary cock-blocked me earlier
and I didn't say one thing but now

08:28.040 --> 08:30.443
I'm getting accused
of being the cock-blocker.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.284
He causes a scene,
goes on like a dick

08:38.351 --> 08:40.486
and generally behaves like a wanker.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.441
Charlotte has obviously got to him
really badly.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.119
He looks like
he's gonna fucking blow.

09:14.587 --> 09:19.191
We're back and it's on edge. You'd
cut the atmosphere with a knife.

09:21.594 --> 09:25.197
I'm angry, I'm pissed off, I'm tired.
I end up necking drinks.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.700
To the first night in Prague.
Cheers.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.770
Thinking it's clever,... Aaah!

09:30.836 --> 09:32.772
..it definitely wasn't.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.974
I want you to enjoy your night.

09:35.041 --> 09:39.478
I can see Gary talking to Ricci.
His face looks weird like always.

09:39.545 --> 09:43.416
I know he's talking about me
so I am gonna confront him.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.019
You talking about me?

09:47.086 --> 09:51.057
Ricci's gone like a flash, he knows
what happens in confrontation times.

09:51.123 --> 09:55.528
You chose the worst time to pull
when we're all walking out.

09:55.594 --> 09:59.298
People pissed us of. Like who? You!
So, it was just me?

09:59.365 --> 10:03.736
Don't cock-block us, tell me I've got
to leave or butt in my conversations.

10:03.803 --> 10:07.373
You admit you're a dick?
I'm not a dick. You are.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.744
For talking to a fucking girl? You're
a dick for choosing your time.

10:11.811 --> 10:15.815
Hang on, is this Gary and Charlotte
having a row, falling out,

10:15.881 --> 10:19.285
making up, breaking up?
I've never seen anything like it.

10:19.352 --> 10:24.156
Hang on a second, I see it all the
fucking time, I'm bored as fuck.

10:24.223 --> 10:26.759
Why don't they fucking just grow up?

10:26.826 --> 10:30.062
That girl was fucking minging.
So was she.

10:30.129 --> 10:34.100
Ah, well, she was minging,
everyone in the club was minging.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.837
Gary might smash something now.
I actually fucking might!

10:37.903 --> 10:42.541
Or he might punch the wall. Makes
a change from fucking you doing it.

10:42.608 --> 10:47.013
Two seconds later Gaz is in the
bathroom smashed out of his face.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.015
(retches)

10:49.081 --> 10:52.118
Trying to sober Gaz up,
holding his head underneath the sink

10:52.184 --> 10:54.620
but I just want him
away from Charlotte.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.656
He's drank himself daft.
He's a mortal mess.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.892
No so much of a hash tag lad now.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.628
Normally I'm the one
putting people to bed.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.564
Carrying people to bed,
watching for people being sick.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.267
I need to get to bed, the one person

11:08.334 --> 11:11.203
I know who will look after us
is Charlotte.

11:11.270 --> 11:15.207
All I can hear is,
"Charlotte, Charlotte."

11:15.274 --> 11:18.010
It's Gary. He's a fragile man.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.184
"Charlotte, Charlotte",
and I feel like such a tit.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.620
I want to video him

11:27.686 --> 11:31.490
and say this is what you are
deep down, a little bitch.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.968
The amazing thing was we'd been
arguing five minutes before that.

11:43.035 --> 11:47.973
For her to put it aside and literally
come running to my need is amazing.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.343
(groans)
Even though I am so angry at him

11:51.410 --> 11:54.847
I've gotta be there for him
cos I care about him.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.016
He is me soul mate after all.

12:09.962 --> 12:14.266
Thank God for Charlotte. It's my hour
of need she's came to my rescue.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.215
(singing)

12:29.281 --> 12:32.685
It's no longer the shag pad,
it's the spew pad.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.488
Who wants to get fucking mortal?

12:35.554 --> 12:36.989
(cheering)

12:41.961 --> 12:44.029
Two slippery nipples.

12:44.096 --> 12:47.933
Why the fuck am I standing
next to an eight-foot ram?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.169
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

12:51.237 --> 12:52.905
.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.810
.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.455
We're working for Anna's company,
Geordie Tours,

13:09.522 --> 13:12.358
doing stag and hen do's.
Now we're in Prague.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.394
(yawns)

13:17.596 --> 13:20.166
I've just woke up. I can't see.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.636
The only thing I know is
Charlotte's lying next to us.

13:29.808 --> 13:33.212
This is great. Me and Gary
are cuddling in bed.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.948
Could this be the beginning
of something special?

13:44.723 --> 13:49.862
I've got fanny flutter. I can hear
the sound of Praguish violins.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.797
I wonder what Gary's thinking.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.004
Gary wants a blow job.

13:59.071 --> 14:02.708
I'm horny. I didn't have any action
cos I couldn't even see.

14:06.312 --> 14:10.015
I'm not giving him a blow job
or a wank either.

14:10.082 --> 14:14.687
So it looks like Gary's about to
take matters into his own hands.

14:19.291 --> 14:23.295
I don't wanna have sex with him any
more, that's the new rule.

14:30.135 --> 14:34.373
One minute she's kissing us the next
she's saying we're just friends.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.143
I'm in Prague to have a good time
I don't need this.

14:41.480 --> 14:47.519
# "Sunlight" - Modestep

14:49.755 --> 14:53.525
We all wake up, hung-over to fuck
but I'm pretty sure

14:53.592 --> 14:55.527
Gary will take the cake today.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.532
(groans) Whoa!

15:00.599 --> 15:04.803
I'm starting to get flashbacks
and thinking, "Oh, fuck".

15:04.870 --> 15:08.374
Is that the fucking sick bin?
Lots of puke.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.877
It's no longer the shag pad,
it's the spew pad.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.584
(phone rings)
Anna can fuck off.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.486
Oh, no.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.689
Anna's right-hand woman, Sam,
is in Prague with us.

15:29.561 --> 15:34.466
The last thing I wanna hear is Sam
telling me I'm going on a bar crawl.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.535
See you in a bit. Bye.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.244
(laughter)
Is she fucking nuts?

15:45.311 --> 15:48.747
Do you reckon this will be good?
Aye.

15:48.814 --> 15:54.119
This is what I use to do in Magaluf
for two years so I'm mint at it.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.121
Bye, have fun.
Bye.

I need you to make sure everyone's
happy, they've all got a drink,

16:07.933 --> 16:11.537
they need a seat, find them one.
Make sure they're happy.

16:11.603 --> 16:12.738
Is there any rules?

16:12.805 --> 16:16.375
No kissing, nothing else,
and no getting drunk, OK?

16:16.442 --> 16:19.978
Sam is talking wet as fuck,
she's saying we can't drink

16:20.045 --> 16:24.683
and we can't pull on a bar crawl.
Hello, this is Geordie Shore, bitch.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.220
What we all wanna do in Prague
is get fucked.

16:28.287 --> 16:33.292
The only way to make this a good bar
crawl is to get pissed and show them

16:33.359 --> 16:36.729
how it's done.
I am going to be a role model.

16:36.795 --> 16:41.166
Nobody can leave this place sober,
that includes me as well.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.436
So who wants to get fucking mortal?

16:44.503 --> 16:46.338
(cheering)

16:46.405 --> 16:47.639
To Prague.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.842
(cheering)

16:52.211 --> 16:54.346
Yes!
(cheering)

16:54.413 --> 16:57.850
Even though I'm hanging,
I'm dying from last night,

16:57.916 --> 17:01.320
I've go to get this party
and start necking straight vodka.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.623
Fuck.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.493
One, two, three, four, five.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.597
One, two, three.

17:11.663 --> 17:16.135
We're going to the next bar to get
another bottle of vodka. Let's go.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.236
(cheering)

17:24.242 --> 17:27.780
We're in Prague
and we wanna see a little bit more.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.816
I'm up for that like, frisk.
(laughs)

17:30.883 --> 17:32.985
I can't wait to see the sights.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.721
Ready? Let's go.
Bye. Let's go.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.023
Let's go see the sights.

17:41.193 --> 17:45.230
(shouts)
Oh, for God's sake.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.368
We're on this bridge
and we hear this band.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.205
They're playing this amazing music

17:53.272 --> 17:56.775
and me and Charlotte start dancing
like crazy Praguish people.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.689
Come on, everyone!

18:10.756 --> 18:14.660
(cheering)

18:14.726 --> 18:18.931
I'm pissed, Gary's pissed,
Sophie's pissed, everyone's pissed.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.668
I fucking love Prague.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.138
(cheering)

18:26.205 --> 18:31.076
(chanting, applause)

18:31.143 --> 18:34.079
(cheering)

18:36.248 --> 18:39.551
Towards the end four gorgeous
Scottish birds rock up.

18:45.924 --> 18:49.828
I thought they were just chatting
and flirting. On the sly.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.798
In the bar, got a number.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.701
We get outside,
Gary reveals he got a number.

18:55.767 --> 18:59.671
Even hung-over I'm still gonna
be a lad, I'm still gonna pull.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.618
Prague's mint and that, like,
but sight-seeing's fucking shit.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.220
Should we just do off?
Go where though?

19:15.287 --> 19:20.425
I don't know, just have a little
mish. Go on then. Howeh. Fuck them.

19:20.492 --> 19:25.764
We decide to have some fun although
it's gonna turn into a disaster.

19:29.201 --> 19:33.605
We're on the bridge, having a bit
of banter, looking at some padlocks.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.773
They're mint them.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.175
Scott and Charlotte have fucked off.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.013
Where's Scott and Charlotte gone?
Did they go? Aye.

19:41.079 --> 19:43.649
What the fuck?
This can only mean trouble.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.120
Wherever we are Prague, Amsterdam,

19:48.186 --> 19:52.224
we always like doing some random
shit to mix it up a bit.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.227
So what better
than some mad Czech dancing?

20:11.276 --> 20:13.211
Ricci looks like a gay sheriff.

20:13.278 --> 20:15.948
Dan's a cross between Aladdin
and Dick Van Dyke.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.983
We all look ridiculous.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.752
(singing)

20:28.427 --> 20:30.762
It was like some man and woman

20:30.829 --> 20:34.199
spinning about, the girl's yelping
like she's getting banged,

20:34.266 --> 20:38.403
the man's whistling in some fucking
dress. What's all this about?

20:45.844 --> 20:49.748
We thought Czech dancing was gonna
be shit but you know what?

20:49.815 --> 20:53.919
It lifted we all up.
We're in a good mood. It wasn't bad.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.860
(laughter)

21:01.927 --> 21:04.029
Them moves will not be getting used
later.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.764
(laughs)

21:05.831 --> 21:08.600
(sings) Come on then.
Thanks a lot.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.168
See you later.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.240
Oh, no!

21:15.307 --> 21:20.412
Out of the corner of me eye I spot a
shop. No. Oh, my God, look at that.

21:20.479 --> 21:25.484
A shop with thousands of animal hats
so I need to buy another one.

21:25.550 --> 21:28.186
It's a... It's a... It's a yak.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.088
Can we have these two hats?

21:30.155 --> 21:32.724
(laughs) Wait.

21:34.693 --> 21:38.163
That's actually funny.
Do you wanna get them? Aye.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.768
With Scott by me side and a reindeer
hat on, I'm game for anything.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.772
Let's go in here.
What is it?

21:46.838 --> 21:50.575
Absinthe. Have you tried Absinthe?
Nah. It's not that strong. (laughs)

21:54.613 --> 21:57.215
Let's rub horns sensually.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.720
All I know about Absinthe is it's
lethal as fuck

22:01.787 --> 22:04.456
and it gets you absolutely hammered,
sold.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.726
Whoa! I'm worried.
For brave people.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.629
I'm amazed
at how she's making the Absinthe.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.366
She's burning sugar over
a metal gauze and flipping it over.

22:14.433 --> 22:18.970
My God, this is gonna burn a hole
in me face. Cheers, neck it.

22:22.407 --> 22:27.412
I've got a feeling I'm about to get
fucked up. That's so strong (laughs)

22:27.479 --> 22:31.983
She looks like she's gonna die.
I don't know how I feel about that.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.186
Who am I? What am I doing?

22:34.252 --> 22:39.091
And why the fuck am I standing next
to an eight-foot fucking ram?

22:41.493 --> 22:44.696
I'm sure she means arsehole.
What's a slippery nipple?

22:44.763 --> 22:49.201
Slippery nipple, Baileys, Absinthe,
half, half. Can we have one of them?

22:49.267 --> 22:50.802
What's wrong with us?

22:50.869 --> 22:54.039
Two slippery nipples.
Wahhhhhh. (laughs)

22:54.106 --> 22:56.942
Are we going? (laughs)

22:57.008 --> 22:58.744
To the Gazelle tribe.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.791
As soon as we've left,
I'm absolutely smashed out me face.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.162
(laughs)
Oh, sorry.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.364
Shit, we're fucked.

23:19.431 --> 23:23.068
# Prague, Prague, we all love Prague
you love Prague, you love Prague #

23:23.135 --> 23:27.906
Charlotte is running down the street
shouting "I love Prague" at people.

23:27.973 --> 23:32.210
Everybody loves Prague.
Oh, there's me brother. (laughs)

23:32.277 --> 23:37.783
I fucking knew it would come to
this. Prague, yeah! Prague! Whoo!

23:37.849 --> 23:39.251
Fucking nuts.

23:44.689 --> 23:48.260
This fucking fluff's all over me
face still. What the fuck?

23:48.326 --> 23:50.362
Oi, oi! (laughs)
Hi, everyone.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.731
Gary considers Charlotte as his

23:52.798 --> 23:56.468
and funnily enough,
he also considers Scott his

23:56.535 --> 23:58.737
so this is gonna be quite tricky.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.939
We ended up in a fucking Absinthery.

24:01.006 --> 24:03.842
It wasn't a shot,
she poured half a glass.

24:03.909 --> 24:07.946
Set it on fire for 10 minutes
and she was like, "Neck that".

24:08.013 --> 24:10.615
It was burning a hole through us.

24:10.682 --> 24:13.218
Funny cos you could see Gaz
getting annoyed.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.189
You look so cute together
in your little hats. (laughs)

24:17.255 --> 24:21.226
Nothing would ever happen.
Scott wouldn't be that stupid.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.061
Glad you had fun.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.563
Realistically, I'm not arsed.

24:26.464 --> 24:29.534
Gaz is clearly jealous
I've been out with Scott

24:29.601 --> 24:34.439
why is he bothered cos he got
a girl's number? Daniel? Daniel!

24:35.674 --> 24:36.775
Come here.

24:36.842 --> 24:40.212
Jump out the shower, I get summoned
to the girl's office.

24:50.555 --> 24:54.926
I've got Gaz's back so I'm gonna be
selective about what I tell them.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.967
Dan thinks he's being clever

25:02.033 --> 25:05.003
but Charlotte's finding out
what she needs to know.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.814
Sorry girls,
no information out of me, unlucky.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.187
She's a size fucking eight, shit.

25:30.829 --> 25:34.766
Charlotte's acting like she's not
bothered but she is. She's gutted Gaz

25:34.833 --> 25:38.069
has asked another girl to come out.
There's gonna be hell on.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.108
We're all out, looking great,
feeling good.

25:43.174 --> 25:44.609
Gis a kiss.

25:44.676 --> 25:47.846
It couldn't be going better.
I feel like a freak.

25:47.913 --> 25:49.681
Dan is just absolutely smashed.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.416
(moans)

25:51.483 --> 25:56.421
The last thing I wanna do is be
associated with alcohol this morning

25:56.488 --> 25:59.024
(bang! bang!)
(screams)

25:59.090 --> 26:01.092

26:02.160 --> 26:03.929

26:21.313 --> 26:25.717

Geordie Tours, getting fucked up.

26:38.096 --> 26:41.733
Second night in Prague, we're all
out looking great, feeling good.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.336
Can't wait. The club is amazing.

26:49.841 --> 26:53.078
We're all getting smashed,
we're all dancing

26:53.144 --> 26:56.681
and I spot them Scottish girls
from the bar crawl.

26:56.748 --> 26:57.849
Buzzin'.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.020
Yeah.

27:02.087 --> 27:04.923
The girls Gary met
at the bar crawl turn up.

27:04.990 --> 27:08.960
I didn't feel bothered any of the
other times. I was empty

27:09.027 --> 27:12.998
like a Tin Man but now
it's stabbing us in the heart.

27:13.064 --> 27:17.769
Last night she was playing Florence
Nightingale for Gaz,

27:17.836 --> 27:21.072
and now he's acting like
she doesn't even exist.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.276
I'm necking on,
it couldn't be going better.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.786
I don't want Gary to see I'm crying.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.758
I feel like a freak.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.861
I need to find Gaz
and get this sorted.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.496
Ricci comes running over.

27:45.797 --> 27:47.732
Telling me Charlotte's crying again.

27:50.068 --> 27:55.173
We're going back in time. Charlotte
hasn't cried about me pulling in ages

28:01.012 --> 28:04.783
As soon as I know Charlotte's upset,
I'm not bringing birds back.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.752
She was there for me,
I'll be there for her.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.225
The night's going mint,
me and Gaz have pulled.

28:14.292 --> 28:17.662
Dan's spitting his dummy
cos the bird he's been cracking onto

28:17.729 --> 28:19.798
all night has completely pied him.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.470
All of a sudden
Dan is absolutely smashed.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.708
Ow!

28:30.775 --> 28:34.446
Dan is making a prick of himself
and making his mouth go.

28:37.248 --> 28:38.783
He's telling Ricci to fuck off.

28:44.322 --> 28:45.824
Dan's had far too much.

28:49.094 --> 28:52.597
Best thing to do is get back
to the house ASAP.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.478

29:06.544 --> 29:11.082
So I've made it home without any
more incidents. (moans drunkenly)

29:11.149 --> 29:12.217
Dan's fucking smashed.

29:12.283 --> 29:15.787
Cheese. I like cheese.

29:15.854 --> 29:19.624
He's acting and looking
like a complete fucking dildo.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.862
Get to bed, sleep it off

29:23.928 --> 29:27.899
and we'll talk in the morning.
I'll call you a wanker then.

29:27.966 --> 29:29.267
(retches)

29:29.334 --> 29:31.402

29:31.469 --> 29:33.538

a patch on how rough Dan's feeling.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.385
Oh, fucking hell.

29:47.452 --> 29:51.189
Girls, we're going off
to have some girl time.

29:51.256 --> 29:54.425
Boys, we've found something
really good for you.

29:54.492 --> 29:57.695
We're hanging and the girls have got
something nice planned.

29:57.762 --> 30:00.532
They never have anything nice
planned for we.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.638
While the boys go and relax,

30:06.704 --> 30:10.241
we're gonna get our aggression out
at the shooting range.

30:10.308 --> 30:12.610
Hurry up, I wanna shoot shit.

30:12.677 --> 30:16.548
I feel a little bit worried
for all our lives.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.917
Hi, nice to meet you.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.253
OK. I don't know who
I'm more concerned about

30:22.320 --> 30:26.624
Charlotte cos she's got absolutely
no aim and flaccid arms or Holly

30:26.691 --> 30:28.893
cos she's a bit fucking unhinged.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.094
Charlotte goes first.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.997
Whoa, God, this is really scary.

30:33.064 --> 30:36.534
She's nervous. She's holding the gun
whilst going like this.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.705
I'm ready to shoot this gun
like a boy shooting his load

30:40.772 --> 30:42.440
all over a girl's breasts.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.177
(screams)

30:46.244 --> 30:50.982
Keep going, boom, boom, boom!
(screams)

30:51.049 --> 30:52.584
(shouts)

30:56.354 --> 30:59.891
When we get there it's a spa.
Wicked.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.759
A different kind of spa.

31:01.826 --> 31:05.263
You've got a beer pump
while you're bathing in beer.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.866
It doesn't get much better than that.
Dan, all the best.

31:08.933 --> 31:12.670
The last thing I wanna do
is be associated with alcohol.

31:15.073 --> 31:18.643
Yes! Go on, lass.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.545
Has she hit the ten?

31:20.612 --> 31:22.347
Sophie gets all into it.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.182
I've got to get the head.

31:24.249 --> 31:27.018
All Rambo and Charlie's Angels
all at once.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.587
Whoa, fucking hell!

31:29.654 --> 31:34.225
Me aim's so good, I'm getting on the
board and that's all I wanna do.

31:34.292 --> 31:36.227
Look where I've just hit.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.030
Then I realise
I've fucking killed the hostage.

31:43.968 --> 31:48.973
The woman decides to hoy what looks
like mushy peas all over me knob.

31:49.040 --> 31:55.747
I can see beer, I'm drinking beer. I
just wanna go home and end my life.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.119
Oh, my, God. I'm so nervous.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.688
(screams)

32:03.755 --> 32:08.092
Go on, Holly, aim at the cock.
Am I getting anywhere near the cock?

32:08.159 --> 32:10.228
You may have took out a testicle.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.830
I definitely
shouldn't be allowed a gun.

32:34.852 --> 32:38.956
(phone rings)
Sam, the other boss, is ringing.

32:40.224 --> 32:43.561
Yeah, I suppose.
I hate her as much as Anna.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.571
Today's Geordie Tours job
involves me, Vicky and Scott

32:53.638 --> 32:56.607
guiding people around Prague
on top of a bus.

32:56.674 --> 33:00.411
We are good at fake tan,
we are good at drinking.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.047
Tour guides? Being sober?
Not our thing.

33:03.114 --> 33:07.018
Everyone's paid good money
to get a good tour of Prague

33:07.085 --> 33:10.388
and here we turn up, Tweedle Dumb,
Tweedle Twat and me.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.294
(cheering)

33:16.361 --> 33:19.497
We've got about 50 pairs of eyes
staring at us,

33:19.564 --> 33:21.499
we know fuck all about Prague.

33:21.566 --> 33:24.135
Everyone, if you look to your right,

33:24.202 --> 33:28.606
that restaurant is actually favoured
by the King of Prague.

33:30.575 --> 33:35.146
Vicky fucking P is on the M-I-C
and it's going fucking shit.

33:35.213 --> 33:38.216
That's where the King of Prague
gets his sandwiches.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.518
There is no King of Prague.

33:40.585 --> 33:44.021
Everyone, look, there's some water.

33:44.088 --> 33:47.892
Don't swim in the river,
it's cold and very dirty.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.629
Stop the bus cos I'm fucking offski.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.401
Last night in Prague.
Big night, family night.

33:56.467 --> 34:01.305
I love family time. So do we. How
about tonight we have no pullsies?

34:01.372 --> 34:02.974
Pullsies no bringsies backsies.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.778
The first night I was with you,
the second I was birdsies.

34:06.844 --> 34:10.481
Well, then the third night families.
Yeah? OK. Wicked.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.585
It's a massive Praguish party.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.487
(cheering)

34:16.554 --> 34:17.955
Strip clubs, girls.

34:19.924 --> 34:25.029
Dan just came in his pants.
Scott's misinterpreted family night.

34:25.096 --> 34:29.534
I cant help it if 300 birds want
me cock. Stop head fucking us!

34:31.536 --> 34:33.704
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

34:34.806 --> 34:36.440
.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.012
.

34:45.283 --> 34:50.788
# "C'mon" - Kesha

34:52.690 --> 34:56.027
Gaz tonight has come up
with a wicked idea, strip club.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.398
What are you gonna do instead?
(laughs)

35:00.465 --> 35:01.899
I trust him.

35:01.966 --> 35:06.170
I know he's not going to do anything
but drink and have some banter

35:06.237 --> 35:10.808
and feel very uncomfortable cos
of my questions when he comes home.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.619
I'm 20 and I've never ever
been to a strip club.

35:21.686 --> 35:25.056
Dan reveals he's never been
to a strip club in his life.

35:25.122 --> 35:27.225
What?
You're gonna love it.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.293
The lads are mortified.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.663
Strip club virgin, gonna love it.
Be in his element.

35:32.730 --> 35:35.733
Your fucking jaw
is gonna be on the floor, son.

35:35.800 --> 35:40.738
What next? He's just grown his
first pube? Hash tag baby cock.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.441
And the boy became a man.

35:43.508 --> 35:49.313
# "Hitz"
- Chase &amp; Status feat Tinie Tempah

35:57.488 --> 36:02.126
We get right at the front. Dan looks
like a rabbit in the headlights.

36:02.193 --> 36:06.998
My eyes are like golf balls.
It's better than Christmas morning

36:07.064 --> 36:09.734
Dan, do you want a drink?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.802
Dan, are you enjoying Prague?

36:18.509 --> 36:22.213
I've been here two minutes
but I'm dying to knock one out.

36:27.718 --> 36:32.723
Money in the thong,
she give us a little kiss. Wicked.

36:38.930 --> 36:43.334
I can't believe I'm 20 and I've
never been to one of these places.

36:43.401 --> 36:45.636
Membership?
I've got this mint stripper

36:45.703 --> 36:49.574
grinding on me pipe. I reckon
she's enjoying it more than me.

36:52.209 --> 36:55.212
It's not often you get
to grind on Zeus himself.

36:55.279 --> 36:58.215
I'm all right, thank you.

36:58.282 --> 37:02.587
I've never seen James and Ricci
so scared of a pair of tits.

37:02.653 --> 37:07.124
A girl tries to sit on me lap
and it's never ever gonna happen.

37:07.191 --> 37:09.160
I don't know who's most
uncomfortable.

37:09.226 --> 37:12.263
James is running away,
Ricci's just shit hisself.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.665
And Dan's just came his pants.

37:14.732 --> 37:18.402
Tonight we've been with the lads,
had girls grinding on us,

37:18.469 --> 37:22.006
Scott's got a bra round his neck.
This has been the best night.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.810
James and Ricci have been looking
at their watches all night.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.345
Let's see the girls.

37:27.411 --> 37:33.951
# "Centipede" - Knife Party

37:35.686 --> 37:39.056
It's a tradition
when there's been too much drama,

37:39.123 --> 37:43.127
too many random on nights out
that we call for a family night.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.496
It's all about us and not pulling.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.734
There's no shagging,
there's no necking on,

37:49.800 --> 37:52.370
and them are the rules.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.805
And we take them very seriously.

37:58.242 --> 38:03.014
This is the best club
I have probably ever been to.

38:03.080 --> 38:08.319
We're doing shitloads of shots,
what more could you fucking ask for?

38:08.386 --> 38:11.188
Girls on the bar,
dancing practically half-naked.

38:11.255 --> 38:13.224
There's fire breathers.

38:16.027 --> 38:19.964
Fish bowls, music's unreal,
it's a massive Praguish party.

38:20.031 --> 38:25.970
# "Green Light" - Roll Deep

38:27.605 --> 38:30.408
I think Scott's
misinterpreted the family night.

38:32.209 --> 38:36.313
The girls have asked for one simple
thing but Scott can't help himself.

38:38.816 --> 38:42.787
Me and Sophie need to talk
to Scotty T about his behaviour.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.129
Two seconds fucking later.

38:55.599 --> 38:58.903
Scotty T, over at girls, necking on,

38:58.969 --> 39:02.373
tashing on,
couldn't give a fuck about family.

39:04.275 --> 39:08.446
I love the family but what do you
want us to do become a monk?

39:08.512 --> 39:13.017
It's in one ear, out the other.
How? He's got quite a large head.

39:13.084 --> 39:16.854
I'd think it'd take a while
to come out but it's so fast.

39:16.921 --> 39:19.757
There's nothing in the middle!
He hasn't got a brain.

39:25.396 --> 39:28.799
Charlotte's giving us a fucking
bollocking for try to pull.

39:33.237 --> 39:36.273
I can't help it if 300 birds
want me cock.

39:38.008 --> 39:41.278
That's it, I'm sick to death
of these stupid boys.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.852
I'm gonna let my stress out and
dance on the stage with the DJ.

39:47.918 --> 39:51.255
I'm showing all the boys,
who gives a fuck?

39:51.322 --> 39:53.624
I'm ready to rock on their dicks.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.293
And then the DJ even notices this.

39:58.496 --> 40:01.532
I'm like,
"Yeah, I'll jump on your dick too."

40:08.806 --> 40:11.709
So I'm chatting to two English guys.

40:11.776 --> 40:15.946
Gary's getting angry about it
saying this is family night.

40:20.584 --> 40:24.321
I'm not trying to pull. I know the
difference between a conversation

40:24.388 --> 40:27.224
and wanting
to get someone's cock out.

40:29.627 --> 40:33.798
I hate him! Why's he bothered?
He was with a girl the other night.

40:33.864 --> 40:37.301
He's unreadable.
He's like the Spanish bible.

40:37.368 --> 40:40.371
Why are you angry
when you get into other girls?

40:40.437 --> 40:43.440
This is why I cry! Why I'm upset.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.012
I want Gaz to loosen his reins.

40:56.887 --> 41:00.157
Charlotte and Gaz are having another
fucking argument about pulling.

41:00.224 --> 41:03.027
In other shocking news,
water is wet.

41:07.598 --> 41:14.371
(cheering)

41:22.746 --> 41:25.749
We're all absolutely smashed
so it's straight to bed.

41:30.721 --> 41:35.159
My head's spinning. The last thing
I want is Holly spinning on me cock.

41:47.271 --> 41:51.876
Last place I thought I'd be is in
Gary's bed, but it's just as friends

41:55.112 --> 41:57.548
After everything we've been through,

41:57.615 --> 42:00.584
lying here with her now
actually feels quite right.

42:07.224 --> 42:10.694
Shit, I've woken up in bed
with Scotty T.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.166
We both know nothing happened.

42:16.233 --> 42:20.037
She kept on her side of the bed,
I kept on mine, sorted.

42:20.104 --> 42:22.106
Last night was good, wasn't it?

42:25.643 --> 42:29.880
I've woke up in bed with Gary.
I feel bad about arguing with him.

42:29.947 --> 42:34.184
It's time to mention the strip club
before Vicky starts her inquisition.

42:34.251 --> 42:37.054
There was fannies
and boobies on stage.

42:37.121 --> 42:41.091
I hope you enjoyed looking cos
you're never gonna see mine again.

42:41.158 --> 42:43.827
Did you get a dance?
Nah.

42:43.894 --> 42:44.895
What?

42:44.962 --> 42:49.600
No, they were all ugly
compared to you. (both laugh)

42:49.667 --> 42:52.036
We're like the sun and the moon.

42:57.474 --> 43:02.046
Every once in a blue moon
they'll cross, like an eclipse

43:11.121 --> 43:12.890
Newcastle!
We're back in Newcastle.

43:12.957 --> 43:17.528
Buzzing, I'm gonna play with me clit
You've been wanking over a man.

Fucking arse.
Fuck off then, you slag!

43:27.838 --> 43:30.307
Who invited fucking
Grandmother Willow to the party?

43:30.374 --> 43:34.211
The cock was inserted into the fairy
hole for a couple of seconds.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.081
You happy now, knob?
Time I walked away.

43:37.147 --> 43:38.615
