10:28.919 --> 10:30.463
No, stay close.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.881
We just need a better view.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.592
We passed a hill back there.
We could climb it and see?

10:34.675 --> 10:36.427
We don't have time to backtrack.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.930
Let me get a better look.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.318
Careful, Pru!

10:52.401 --> 10:56.072
You're the best tree-climber ever, but
you've never climbed a treesicle before.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.281
What?

10:58.282 --> 10:59.950
[Pru] I can't see anything yet.

11:00.910 --> 11:01.952

11:29.230 --> 11:30.564

11:38.656 --> 11:39.657
Phew!

-Are you hurt?
-I'm all right. I'm fine, really.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.378
I think I saw something. That way.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.004
[Chica Linda snorts]

11:57.508 --> 12:00.136
So now we need
a new poem for icicle trees.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.471
What rhymes with "heart-stopping plummet"?

12:04.181 --> 12:06.767
This is it. This is... This is what I saw.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.227
It must be Daisy's.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.688
So we are on the right track.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.981
Let's keep moving!

12:17.903 --> 12:18.904

Thanks, boy.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.918

-[Boomerang nickers]

12:49.268 --> 12:50.102
Wait!

12:51.437 --> 12:52.938
She must have gone this way.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.399
Those prints are fresh.
She's got to be close by.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.402
Let's spread out to cover more ground.
Everyone have their whistles?

12:59.820 --> 13:01.280

On thin ice!

14:26.448 --> 14:27.366
Daisy?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.360
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.112
I get afraid all the time.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.197
And you know what?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.032
My friends and my horse,

they're always there to help me.

And now they're gonna help you, too.

the other end of the rope. See them?

They won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.045
But... I'm scared.

I am, too.

But you're a frontier girl now, like me,

18:12.716 --> 18:14.218

18:14.718 --> 18:16.637
-OK?
-OK.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.722
Together. Take it slow.

Don't worry, I made them double check
that you still have all your toes.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.516
How are you feeling?

21:49.599 --> 21:51.018
I'm... [grunts]

21:51.101 --> 21:52.227
...kind of hot.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.232
-Daisy. Is she--
-Why don't you ask her yourself?

22:00.861 --> 22:01.862
Hi.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.239
I want to thank you for saving my Daisy.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.782
You girls are heroes.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.577
Here's your doll.

22:10.704 --> 22:13.081
You keep it. I don't need her any more.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.709
[chuckles] I'm a real frontier girl now.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.170
You sure are.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.256
Looks like you've got one more visitor.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.925

22:24.009 --> 22:25.010
[snorts]

22:27.054 --> 22:28.513
Oh, Spirit!

22:28.597 --> 22:29.890
[whinnies]

22:30.223 --> 22:32.434
-[Jim] We couldn't keep him out.
-[Miss Flores gasps]

22:33.727 --> 22:36.104
-[Miss Flores] Oh, watch the plant!
-[Lucky] Oh, Spirit!

22:36.188 --> 22:37.939
-[Spirit neighs]
