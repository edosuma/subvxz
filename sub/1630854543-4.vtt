00:17.640 --> 00:18.920
Excuse me?

00:26.800 --> 00:28.480
Is this the Land of the Dead?

00:30.679 --> 00:32.399
Just tell us where you're going.

00:33.759 --> 00:36.679
It's like they're being pulled forward
by something.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.880
Pan, stop that.

00:44.719 --> 00:46.079
What's he doing?

00:51.520 --> 00:55.159
- This is what we were expecting.
- Then where are everyone's daemons?

00:55.159 --> 00:57.000
We've been in plenty of worlds
without daemons before.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.759
Just get in my pocket and we'll be fine.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.200
There are people here who should
have daemons, but don't.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.079
Is he okay?

01:11.719 --> 01:12.840
He's fine.

01:13.959 --> 01:15.079
Doesn't seem it.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.799
- You've seen that before?
- No.

01:25.359 --> 01:26.680
Are we in the wrong place?

01:28.519 --> 01:29.840
This has to be right.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.439
It has to be it. Come on.

02:23.319 --> 02:24.639
Stop right there.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.520
Halt!

02:30.960 --> 02:32.680
Hello.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.479
Delighted to see you again.

02:37.039 --> 02:40.240
Please tell the Cardinal
that Mrs. Coulter is back.

04:05.960 --> 04:11.199
HIS DARK MATERIALS

04:36.560 --> 04:38.079
Good. This is good.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.879
No. No. Stop!

04:44.879 --> 04:46.720
Everyone, stop.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.759
You.

04:51.279 --> 04:52.920
Yes, I'm talking to you.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.160
You aren't dead.

04:57.519 --> 04:58.560
It was an accident.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.319
We were being chased by some men and
we just sort of found ourselves here.

05:01.319 --> 05:04.560
If you're not dead... you're not welcome.

05:05.399 --> 05:06.519
Listen.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.600
We've travelled a long way. I need
to find my friend before it's too late.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.839
First you were chased by men.
Now you're looking for friendship?

05:14.839 --> 05:17.639
Well, you won't find that here...
you liar.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.120
Go to holding area thirty-two.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.920
Give them this.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.319
How long do we wait?

05:35.720 --> 05:37.639
Until you die, of course.

05:41.639 --> 05:42.879
Go!

05:47.800 --> 05:49.160
What does it say?

05:53.680 --> 05:57.560
This has to be the place. We need to find
the water and we need to cross it.

06:01.639 --> 06:05.600
I do hope we sustained no lasting
damage after our previous meeting.

06:07.639 --> 06:09.959
I was simply trying to protect
my daughter.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.519
And you had such a lot to say
last time we spoke.

06:14.519 --> 06:20.279
All sorts of beautiful words about escape
and stupidity and mistakes.

06:20.279 --> 06:22.560
All words fed to you by
the Cardinal, I know.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.759
Father President.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.279
- I beg your pardon?
- He is not the Cardinal.

06:27.279 --> 06:28.879
He is Father President.

06:29.759 --> 06:32.120
And they were not his words.
They were mine.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.879
Oh, yes. I've known obsession like yours.

06:35.879 --> 06:37.439
Have you?

06:38.319 --> 06:39.959
I don't think you have.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.480
I don't think you understand faith.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.319
Father Gomez,
you are a very young man.

06:46.319 --> 06:50.079
Did you not think we knew
you were coming? Back to us.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.079
Where you belong.

06:54.759 --> 06:59.000
I find it very hard to judge what the
Magisterium knows and doesn't know.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.839
Its faith always seems to get in the way.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.600
Who?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.600
- It's Father Gomez. I have with me...
- It's me, Hugh.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.639
Or do you only answer to
"Father President" now?

07:20.920 --> 07:23.040
Come on, let us in.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.600
Come.

07:31.399 --> 07:32.519
After you.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.399
Mrs. Coulter.

07:48.399 --> 07:49.600
Is the boy staying?

07:51.480 --> 07:52.720
Thank you, Father Gomez.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.199
Good. Then it's just the two of us.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.720
- You're under arrest, of course.
- How disappointing.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.399
- For deliberate concealment...
- There really is no need.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.799
- I'm here to help.
- You have prevented us from finding Eve.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.000
If you'll let me finish.

08:57.039 --> 08:59.039
I came here voluntarily.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.080
As soon as I could escape
from Asriel's fortress, I did.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.279
Look at my clothes, Hugh.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.919
I even brought you
a piece of his technology...

09:07.919 --> 09:10.759
which I'm sure your scholars
will be delighted to drool over.

09:10.759 --> 09:15.919
- All that matters is the child.
- My child.

09:15.919 --> 09:19.600
The alethiometer was quite
clear on who she is

09:19.600 --> 09:21.639
and what she might bring to us.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.080
Are you still hurting yourself?

09:33.440 --> 09:37.519
I made you Cardinal.
I did that to earn your trust.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.879
- And in return, you have betrayed me.
- I betrayed you?

09:42.639 --> 09:45.960
- She is sin!
- No.

09:46.679 --> 09:49.480
She is the potential of it,
and I wasn't unaware of this.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.960
- And I had my own solution...
- You had nothing of the sort!

09:51.960 --> 09:53.279
...to keep her safe
until the danger passed.

09:53.279 --> 09:56.279
- Your lies are contemptible!
- You destroyed everything!

10:06.919 --> 10:11.559
What danger did you think
you were keeping her safe from?

10:14.399 --> 10:16.120
Eden fell...

10:16.120 --> 10:19.799
Not when Eve came into being
but when she was tempted.

10:21.039 --> 10:24.320
Somewhere out there is a tempter.
A serpent.

10:25.399 --> 10:27.559
And I had to keep them from meeting.

10:28.679 --> 10:32.759
I had her. I had the boy. I had it all...

10:32.759 --> 10:35.559
And then you sent your troops
and scared them away.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.039
I assume Fra Pavel
told you about a knife.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.360
A weapon so powerful,
it could kill the Authority himself.

10:54.399 --> 10:55.960
I broke that knife.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.480
It was I who tamed it.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.159
So, do not underestimate
what I can still do for you.

11:06.919 --> 11:09.639
Trust me to advise you as I once did.

11:09.639 --> 11:13.480
Concentrate on the battles
that need to be fought and leave Lyra,

11:13.480 --> 11:15.320
and her temptation to me.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.919
Is Asriel still actively
searching for the girl?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.480
She never held much of his interest.

11:27.879 --> 11:29.440
The knife attracted him.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.799
But now it is broken...
he sees only his war.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.240
And the way he is fighting, Hugh, it's...

11:39.440 --> 11:40.799
terrifying.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.919
You know, I think I saw him murder an
angel in front of my eyes.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.879
An angel?

11:57.799 --> 11:59.639
An angel came to Asriel?

12:01.919 --> 12:03.080
Yes.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.600
And he would hurt such a thing?

12:08.600 --> 12:11.639
He would hurt anything
that came into his path.

12:11.639 --> 12:16.279
I tell you, there is madness upon him...
and that is why I came, Hugh.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.840
To give you what I could.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.399
Then you are with us for the fight?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.840
Against Asriel.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.879
Against Dust.

12:28.639 --> 12:29.919
You doubt me?

12:30.600 --> 12:34.720
Sometimes your devotion
is hard to read, Marisa.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.240
You have my mind...

12:39.240 --> 12:41.200
my body, and my soul.

12:44.559 --> 12:47.120
And I thank the Authority himself...

12:48.360 --> 12:53.440
that we have you leading the
Magisterium, and not Cardinal Sturrock.

12:57.639 --> 13:00.360
He could never resist temptation.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.519
Whereas you...
your abstinence is magnificent.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.120
Remember what we did together.

13:32.039 --> 13:34.600
Our lives are entwined.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.240
Papers?

14:08.120 --> 14:10.000
Go to holding area five-oh-seven.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.039
- Another holding area?
- Not another holding area, no.

14:15.039 --> 14:19.039
Holding area five-o-seven.
Five-zero-seven.

14:19.039 --> 14:21.639
- That's the important bit.
- Where is it?

14:22.679 --> 14:25.840
Just ask.
Everybody's waiting. Same as you.

14:33.879 --> 14:35.039
Papers?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.639
- Good evening.
- For you.

14:52.639 --> 14:54.080
A peace offering.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.440
And what exactly is that?

15:00.279 --> 15:02.120
Does it fold out into a cage?

15:08.840 --> 15:10.120
It's how we found you.

15:11.759 --> 15:13.159
A kind gift.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.480
Really?

15:26.639 --> 15:27.759
Mother.

15:28.879 --> 15:30.559
She was only too happy to help.

15:34.519 --> 15:35.840
'Course, she was.

16:21.799 --> 16:25.320
And she always had such grace.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.639
Hello, Mrs. Coulter.

16:35.759 --> 16:40.559
Well, you see, that's the problem
with insects. They get everywhere.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.399
I'm the least of your problems.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.759
Did he send you?

16:44.759 --> 16:47.360
Yes, I followed you into
the intention craft.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.799
So, are you here to spy or to help?

16:50.519 --> 16:51.759
What's your plan?

16:51.759 --> 16:54.039
What? So you can relay
my every move to Asriel?

16:54.039 --> 16:55.879
- I didn't think so.
- I can't.

16:55.879 --> 16:58.879
My lodestone resonator was damaged
during your escape.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.879
Interesting.
So, in fact, it's you who needs me.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.920
You intend to kill them before
they kill Lyra.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.839
And if they kill you first?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.839
You risk yourself very easily.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.119
What do you know of this place?

17:19.839 --> 17:21.000
What have you seen?

17:22.279 --> 17:24.319
Come on, you have no choice.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.640
Without me, you have no intention craft,

17:27.640 --> 17:31.039
and without the intention craft,
you can't return to Asriel.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.279
What have you seen?

17:35.359 --> 17:37.240
I've been following Father Gomez.

17:38.079 --> 17:40.839
He seems particularly interested
in one room.

18:52.519 --> 18:53.759
Do we keep walking?

18:54.920 --> 18:57.039
Feels like we should just keep walking.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.759
They're staring, aren't they?

18:58.759 --> 19:01.160
Yeah, they're staring and saying nothing.

19:01.759 --> 19:03.559
Feels like we're in a horror film.

19:04.160 --> 19:07.599
Why would you want to watch a film
that makes you feel horrible?

19:07.599 --> 19:09.079
You make a good point.

19:09.079 --> 19:11.559
- I liked the film with the bear.
- Who are you?

19:14.319 --> 19:15.599
We're travellers.

19:16.119 --> 19:18.279
We're headed to the Land of the Dead.

19:18.279 --> 19:21.160
Yeah. Well, we're on the same path.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.079
Please. We don't know what we're doing,
and you seem vaguely friendly.

19:30.599 --> 19:32.799
We just really need to know
what the rules are here.

19:36.799 --> 19:39.720
Okay... you can come in.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.839
Thank you.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.519
So...

19:56.359 --> 19:57.640
introduce yourselves.

19:58.319 --> 20:01.200
Hi, I'm Lyra. This is Will.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.799
We won't disturb you any more
than we need to...

20:04.359 --> 20:07.039
but we're looking for my friend.
He's in the Land of the Dead,

20:07.039 --> 20:09.839
We don't know if this is a
part of it, or how to get to it,

20:09.839 --> 20:14.039
so if any of you could tell us
anything, we'd really appreciate it.

20:14.039 --> 20:16.039
Why haven't their Deaths told
them where to be?

20:16.039 --> 20:20.240
- Larissa, they've come to ask for help.
- Well, they shouldn't need it.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.759
- Talk to your Deaths.
- We don't have Deaths.

20:22.759 --> 20:24.480
'Cause we're not dead.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.759
Okay. Take a seat.

20:37.359 --> 20:39.039
You're not dead either, right?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.319
All of you in the holding area.

20:41.720 --> 20:46.079
Our Death... hovers close by...
and guides us.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.920
We would welcome it...
we're ready, but...

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
it's not ready to take us yet.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.960
What's a Death?

20:55.960 --> 20:57.799
They don't know anything.

21:01.079 --> 21:02.200
Everyone has a Death.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.119
It goes everywhere with them.
All their life long.

21:06.119 --> 21:10.039
- Isn't that scary?
- Not at all, dear. It's natural.

21:12.599 --> 21:14.480
From the moment you're born...

21:16.039 --> 21:18.160
your Death comes into the world with ya.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.960
And it's your Death that takes you out.

21:24.079 --> 21:25.200
There's love in that.

21:26.359 --> 21:28.880
- Can you see our Death?
- No, love.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.400
Just our own.

21:34.720 --> 21:38.880
When you're ready...
they say ifs beautiful.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.519
Your Death says...

21:41.519 --> 21:47.559
"Easy, now. Easy, child.
You come along with me."

21:48.680 --> 21:50.279
And you go with them...

21:50.799 --> 21:53.440
to the boat and the boatman.

21:54.279 --> 21:57.920
That's what I saw in my dream.
That's where we need to go.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.359
Well, you're not going to get there
without your Death.

22:01.359 --> 22:03.279
If you just tell us where it is,
we'll stop bothering you.

22:03.279 --> 22:06.599
We don't know where it is.
Or what's on the other side.

22:06.599 --> 22:09.319
No one knows
'cause no one's ever come back.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.599
The only way you're going
to cross the water

22:14.599 --> 22:18.640
and go to the Land of the Dead
is with your own Deaths.

22:20.079 --> 22:24.599
Invite them to you,
in kindness and friendship...

22:26.359 --> 22:27.920
and they will come.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.319
Breakfast.

22:37.599 --> 22:40.720
I have no need of breakfast. I must pray.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.799
Where is the chapel in this citadel?

22:52.119 --> 22:55.079
Mrs. Coulter,
you were expected to stay in your room.

22:55.079 --> 22:58.400
No, I'm looking for the chapel.
I need to repent my sins.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.480
You can pray in your room just as easily
as you can in a chapel.

23:02.480 --> 23:05.920
No, I find the Authority speaks loudest
to me in his own house.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.279
Well, if you wish to go to chapel,
you must go at the allotted time.

23:14.279 --> 23:16.799
Damn. Really?

23:16.799 --> 23:20.160
Well, now that I'm here, you don't mind
if I take a look around, do you?

23:28.640 --> 23:31.640
No. They're not very interesting.

23:36.599 --> 23:38.039
If you won't stop...

23:38.039 --> 23:41.519
You'll do what, exactly?

23:43.359 --> 23:44.680
I'll fetch support.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.440
Good.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.559
We all need support.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.759
Go on.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.240
- Morning.
- Morning.

24:18.359 --> 24:19.839
Doctor Cooper.

24:24.079 --> 24:26.359
How wonderful...

24:26.359 --> 24:29.960
and unexpected you're still in
employment!

24:29.960 --> 24:33.200
In fact...
how wonderful to see you alive.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.240
I'm afraid I rather presumed you weren't.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.279
Hugh MacPhail
picking up all my best cast-offs.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.039
Now... what are we working on here?

24:46.039 --> 24:48.559
This is all restricted,
I'm afraid, Mrs. Coulter...

24:48.559 --> 24:52.400
Doctor Cooper...
you have always been so kind to me.

24:57.359 --> 24:59.880
I see no reason
why you should stop now.

25:01.319 --> 25:02.480
Well, you were...

25:03.359 --> 25:04.839
always kind back.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.559
Besides, the Cardinal...

25:08.400 --> 25:12.240
Father President and I...
hide nothing from each other.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.480
You need not worry.

25:15.359 --> 25:18.640
Now, this is a resonating
chamber of some kind, am I right?

25:20.200 --> 25:24.319
Ah, interesting. You used part of our
design for the daemon guillotine.

25:24.319 --> 25:26.720
In fact, more than just a part.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.759
Now, why would you
be working on that still?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.319
And...

25:36.079 --> 25:37.200
...this.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.160
What does it read?

25:41.279 --> 25:43.880
It reads something which allows it...

25:47.400 --> 25:48.880
Doctor Cooper...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.640
are you building a bomb?

25:53.720 --> 25:56.079
- You don't understand.
- Oh, but I do.

26:05.720 --> 26:10.400
It's directional in some way.
What determines its direction?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.079
The Authority.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.640
Well, that's not true, is it?

26:22.880 --> 26:24.160
They're here.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.440
For me. Not you.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.920
But you already knew that.

26:29.079 --> 26:32.039
What a fascinating position
we find ourselves in.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.200
Gomez.

26:47.759 --> 26:49.279
Lyra, what are you doing?

26:50.920 --> 26:53.640
She said we need to invite our Death.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.119
Maybe if I get my head
in the state it's in...

26:56.119 --> 26:59.079
when I read the alethiometer,
she'll come to me.

26:59.519 --> 27:00.640
Be careful.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.440
Wait. Can we talk about this?

27:07.680 --> 27:11.839
- Talk about what? We already decided.
- I know, but... summoning Death?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.720
- Do you even know what that means?
- No, of course not.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.319
But we've come all this way.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.599
- Maybe this isn't the right thing to do.
- But we are doing it.

27:20.599 --> 27:24.359
- It's what we came here to do.
- It's not too late to turn around.

27:24.359 --> 27:26.839
With the knife,
we'll find our way back home.

27:27.519 --> 27:28.920
You were on my side.

27:29.839 --> 27:31.400
I thought I was by your side.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.759
Neither of you understand, do you?

27:37.759 --> 27:40.279
I never got a chance to say
"goodbye" to Roger.

27:40.279 --> 27:42.440
I never got a chance to say "I'm sorry."

27:43.000 --> 27:45.680
All I want to do is
make things as good as I can.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.440
Even if I have to die doing so.

27:49.119 --> 27:50.240
Lyra...

27:52.039 --> 27:53.160
she's here.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.400
You're my Death.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.599
Yes.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.960
Are you here to take me?

28:09.079 --> 28:11.839
You wanted me. I am here.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.279
I need to talk to her alone.

28:17.759 --> 28:20.359
I can't see who you're talking to.

28:20.359 --> 28:23.000
Of course you can't. She's mine.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.799
Follow me.

28:31.119 --> 28:33.119
I'll be back. Don't worry.

28:58.359 --> 28:59.480
Authority...

29:01.279 --> 29:03.160
thank you for answering my prayers.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.680
For delivering to me the means
with which to win this war.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.319
Only through your love...

29:24.160 --> 29:25.480
and your guidance...

29:27.720 --> 29:30.279
will I find the strength
to do what must be done.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.680
To lead us into salvation.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.000
Follow him.

29:57.359 --> 29:58.680
The hair.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.400
We are certain this is a child's?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.279
Fra Pavel is certain.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.640
Is there enough of it, Doctor Cooper?

30:10.519 --> 30:11.680
This will be ample.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.960
How soon can it be ready?

30:16.640 --> 30:17.759
Matter of days.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.599
Thank you, Father Gomez. That'll be all.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.160
You are quite sure that once
set in motion,

30:36.160 --> 30:37.960
the bomb will find the girl?

30:38.680 --> 30:40.720
Each individual is unique.

30:41.559 --> 30:44.039
There are codes within us.
Anbaric pulses.

30:44.839 --> 30:46.480
We use these...

30:47.319 --> 30:48.599
to aim this device.

30:49.240 --> 30:52.839
The hair, wherever it might be,
will want to be made whole.

30:55.319 --> 30:57.319
It will be merciless in this pursuit.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.880
No matter where the girl may be.

31:03.640 --> 31:05.359
Whichever world she is in...

31:06.079 --> 31:08.240
forgive my heresy...

31:08.240 --> 31:10.680
the bomb should find Lyra.

31:33.039 --> 31:34.160
Are you still here?

31:37.400 --> 31:39.480
You keep appearing and disappearing.

31:40.680 --> 31:41.799
I'm always here.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.519
I've followed you your entire life...

31:48.519 --> 31:53.079
I am a special, devoted friend who's been
beside you every moment of your life.

31:54.519 --> 31:56.319
Who knows you better than anyone.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.519
That's not true.

32:00.119 --> 32:03.359
Who knows you better than even
you know yourself.

32:04.279 --> 32:05.799
We need to make a deal.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.559
I'm not sure I can make a deal.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.920
Look, I know I'm not deceased.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.680
but I need to go to the Land
of the Dead

32:15.680 --> 32:18.559
and I need to see someone
there, and I need to get back.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.160
Will you help me?

32:22.920 --> 32:27.200
Eventually, child, you will go to the
Land of the Dead with no effort.

32:28.039 --> 32:29.160
No risk.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.319
A safe and calm journey.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.400
But there is no reason to rush there.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.079
But I need to.

32:39.599 --> 32:40.720
So does Will.

32:42.720 --> 32:46.440
We both had people taken away from us too
soon, and we both need to make amends.

32:46.440 --> 32:50.039
Well, everyone wishes they could speak
again to those who have gone.

32:50.039 --> 32:52.319
Why should there be
an exception for you?

32:54.359 --> 32:55.759
Because...

32:56.640 --> 32:58.720
if you've been with me my whole life...

32:59.920 --> 33:01.799
you knew this question was coming.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.839
And if you've truly been with me...

33:05.839 --> 33:07.359
you know the answer to it.

33:08.359 --> 33:09.599
I have followed you.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.960
I have seen your choices.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.079
You saw him die?

33:20.759 --> 33:21.880
Roger, die?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.359
I did.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.319
I don't wanna be exceptional.

33:35.559 --> 33:37.279
Maybe once I did.

33:39.279 --> 33:41.920
My parents,
that's all they care about.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.119
I just want to be good.

33:45.599 --> 33:47.079
I just want to help someone.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.079
And Roger needs me.

33:50.079 --> 33:52.559
And I wasn't there the last time
he needed me.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.079
Look at me.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.480
Look at my heart.

34:02.279 --> 34:03.400
Help me.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.599
I will be your guide, Lyra Silvertongue.

34:12.800 --> 34:17.280
I will show you the way in.
Once you are there...

34:18.639 --> 34:20.400
the other side is not my place.

34:22.559 --> 34:24.280
So, as for getting out again...

34:24.920 --> 34:27.039
you'll have to manage that by yourself.

35:22.159 --> 35:23.639
Good morning!

35:55.199 --> 35:56.760
Wait. Wait!

36:18.559 --> 36:19.679
You're back.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.519
Is she still...

36:22.519 --> 36:24.199
Close by? Yeah.

36:25.719 --> 36:27.039
What did she say?

36:27.880 --> 36:29.199
Can she see my death?

36:30.000 --> 36:33.719
- You can't see his Death, can you?
- No. And nor will he.

36:34.679 --> 36:37.199
You can't see your Death
until you're ready to.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.119
Until it's time.

36:40.679 --> 36:44.079
Only you can see your Death
when it's the right time.

36:46.840 --> 36:50.199
My Death's gonna take us to the water.
If you're ready.

36:51.599 --> 36:54.039
- Am I ready?
- I hope so.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.320
I need you to be.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.920
You take me into the best places.
You know that?

37:47.280 --> 37:48.400
Cheers.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.199
What else is there left to do?

38:38.639 --> 38:42.960
You came here to protect her, but instead
gave them the fuse to a bomb.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.440
Arrogance.

38:46.079 --> 38:49.079
Sheer arrogance. I underestimated them.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.000
We must leave.
Return to Asriel.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.960
- Once he knows what they are doing...
- He'll do what?

38:58.159 --> 38:59.280
He may...

39:00.960 --> 39:02.239
He will intervene.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.960
Will he?

39:46.519 --> 39:48.000
You know, you're right.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.440
I did come here to kill them
before they kill her.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.599
And I will not let them have
another chance.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.239
We've already stunted their bomb.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.079
- We need to get back.
- No.

40:06.039 --> 40:09.440
Because they will find another way,
then another and another.

40:11.199 --> 40:13.159
This has to stop now.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.159
We must find the intention craft.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.039
What do you intend?

40:26.360 --> 40:27.480
Destruction.

40:43.320 --> 40:46.519
You're walking slower with every step,
you know that?

40:46.519 --> 40:50.039
- It's not too late to change your mind.
- I don't want to change my mind.

40:50.039 --> 40:53.639
Mum used to have this phrase,
"Nothing's fixed until you fix it."

40:55.519 --> 40:58.280
Look, if you don't wanna come, it's okay.
I can go alone.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.079
I didn't spend months searching for you

41:00.079 --> 41:02.079
so I could wave you off
at the gates of hell

41:02.079 --> 41:06.480
I don't think it's hell.
Looks a bit like hell. But it's not.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.239
- I just wanna be sure you're sure.
- I am.

41:08.239 --> 41:09.559
Look, sometimes we do things...

41:09.559 --> 41:11.159
we get places, and we forget
how we got there.

41:11.159 --> 41:12.760
I know how I got here, Will.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.920
And what if we don't come back?

41:16.639 --> 41:19.480
Then, we will've died doing
something important.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.519
Follow me.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.000
Quickly.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.599
Stop right there!

42:02.400 --> 42:03.519
Hey!

42:06.239 --> 42:08.639
- Halt!
- Stop there!

42:09.800 --> 42:10.920
This way.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.320
The intention craft is just ahead.

42:17.079 --> 42:18.199
She's here!

42:30.199 --> 42:32.480
You didn't think I was having
you watched?

42:36.599 --> 42:39.000
You have no choice, Marisa.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.400
You will still kill her.

42:42.079 --> 42:43.480
No matter what I do.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.679
On that...

42:45.559 --> 42:47.159
I have no choice.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.440
Then I have a statement to make.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.880
I wish to stand trial for the murder
of Cardinal Sturrock.

42:57.559 --> 43:00.599
A murder I conspired on
with your Father President.

43:00.599 --> 43:05.840
A man who sins with every
fibre of his being.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.039
Liar.

43:07.639 --> 43:09.840
You know I'm telling the truth.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.760
And I will make the same claim
in front of the Consistorial Court.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.320
You have no rights here!

43:17.320 --> 43:20.320
You are a wanton woman who
has always wanted what she didn't have.

43:20.320 --> 43:24.159
Your husband was killed by your lover,
the heretic Asriel.

43:24.159 --> 43:27.199
And your illegitimate child
was abandoned

43:27.199 --> 43:30.159
until she became sin itself

43:30.159 --> 43:32.519
I have changed. You have not, Hugh.

43:32.519 --> 43:35.519
- You need to be stopped.
- "Hugh?" Who is this "Hugh"?

43:36.079 --> 43:39.880
I am your Father President.
You will address me...

43:40.400 --> 43:42.039
as "Father President"...

43:43.360 --> 43:45.079
or "Your Grace."

43:46.719 --> 43:48.599
Do you understand me?

43:48.599 --> 43:50.159
I'm sorry?

43:51.360 --> 43:53.320
This is where your loyalty lies?

43:54.480 --> 43:56.400
Not with that above?

43:57.320 --> 43:59.239
Not with truth but with power?

44:00.280 --> 44:03.239
- You disappoint me, Father Gomez.
- Get her out of here.

44:03.239 --> 44:04.920
No. No, no, you cannot do this.

44:05.599 --> 44:07.119
You call yourself a holy man?

44:07.599 --> 44:10.679
How do you think your Authority
looks on you now, huh?

44:10.679 --> 44:14.320
A man of hate surrounded by haters
who worship you.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.800
You pig of the cloth.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.039
- Stop her noise!
- Disgusting!

44:19.960 --> 44:21.960
This is what you really are.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.119
An incoherent,
emotional woman.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.440
Why should anyone trust you?

44:28.079 --> 44:30.400
You can barely string
a sentence together.

44:32.679 --> 44:34.360
But such beauty.

44:35.119 --> 44:38.079
Such true, enticing beauty.

44:38.960 --> 44:42.880
And now I will give your beauty
what it has always lacked.

44:45.400 --> 44:46.639
Grace.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.719
Now, I don't know how
you took the hair from us...

44:51.480 --> 44:53.239
but you didn't take all of it.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.480
We still have enough left...

44:56.320 --> 44:57.559
for our purposes.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.360
And when we sever your daemon...

45:03.159 --> 45:04.639
you will be the bullet...

45:05.679 --> 45:08.639
to kill Lyra Belacqua.

45:10.679 --> 45:13.960
And to save us all from sin.

45:23.480 --> 45:27.519
Take her to the cellars.
And bring her daemon to me.

46:31.039 --> 46:32.159
Good evening.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.480
I am so grateful to have you with us.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.840
Leave all belongings and come onboard.

46:44.360 --> 46:45.480
Will he understand?

47:05.480 --> 47:08.440
- We need passage across the water.
- I'm sorry.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.519
One of your party is
unsuitable for travel at this time.

47:12.639 --> 47:14.039
Only one?

47:18.360 --> 47:21.000
- No, that's...
- We have to follow the rules.

47:21.000 --> 47:25.760
A pain but necessary.
No passage. Not for him.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.840
- But he is me.
- If you come, he must stay.

47:29.719 --> 47:33.000
I don't think you understand.
If we separate, we die.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.679
But isn't that what you want?

47:46.440 --> 47:49.199
No, that's not right.
I don't leave part of myself behind.

47:49.199 --> 47:51.039
- Why should she?
- Yes, you do.

47:51.599 --> 47:53.480
Absolutely, you do.

47:54.679 --> 47:56.679
It's her misfortune or luck

47:56.679 --> 48:00.159
to be able to see and talk
to the part she must leave.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.880
You will not know until you are on the
water, and by that time,

48:03.880 --> 48:08.480
fortunately, or unfortunately, it will be
too late for you to do anything about it.

48:09.039 --> 48:12.480
But you must all leave
that part of yourselves here.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.199
The rules are very clear.

48:17.239 --> 48:19.960
We're gonna get on the boat. Don't worry.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.760
Lyra, you're not listening to him.
He won't let us.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.280
...to keep you entertained as we cross.

48:25.280 --> 48:29.360
Look. He can come on the boat.
He fits everywhere...

48:29.360 --> 48:31.880
And we've always travelled together.
No one's ever had any problem with this.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.400
- I don't see how you...
- He can come in the boat...

48:33.400 --> 48:35.840
But if he does, the boat stays here.

48:36.800 --> 48:40.199
- Is this how it works? I can pull it.
- Only I can pull the boat.

48:47.039 --> 48:48.480
Sorry.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.760
We can't separate. We can't.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.440
Pan. No! Pan!

49:02.760 --> 49:04.199
You're risking everything.

49:04.199 --> 49:05.840
When will she see him again?

49:05.840 --> 49:07.920
- Please, Pan.
- She won't.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.679
How can you be so sure
this is the right thing?

49:10.679 --> 49:13.199
And when we leave,
will we come back this way?

49:13.199 --> 49:15.199
I've taken millions across.

49:15.199 --> 49:17.599
- Trust me, Pan, please.
- None have come back.

49:17.599 --> 49:19.239
- We've come so far.
- We will.

49:19.239 --> 49:20.440
We might not survive.

49:21.039 --> 49:25.039
You don't know Lyra, and you don't know
me but we'll find a way. Another way.

49:25.039 --> 49:27.440
So, since we're doing that,
be kind, Boatman.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.840
- Let her take her daemon.
- It's not a rule you can break.

49:32.639 --> 49:33.840
It's a law.

49:35.119 --> 49:37.480
- Like this one.
- That night on the mountain.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.199
We can't do this, Lyra. We can't do this.

49:40.199 --> 49:43.679
You see, I can't tilt my hand and make
the water fly upwards.

49:43.679 --> 49:47.199
No more than I can take her daemon
to the Land of the Dead.

49:47.199 --> 49:50.000
You might have to make
an exception just this once.

49:51.679 --> 49:53.960
None of it was Roger's fault and
I never even got to say goodbye.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.199
How many ages
do you think I've been ferrying people?

49:59.320 --> 50:02.960
Do you think if anything could hurt me,
it wouldn't have happened already?

50:02.960 --> 50:06.079
Do you think the people I carry
come with me gladly?

50:06.079 --> 50:10.920
No, they struggle, they cry, they bribe,
they threaten, they fight! Nothing works.

50:12.239 --> 50:14.159
I don't want to do this.

50:14.159 --> 50:16.280
If there was any other way
to make it right...

50:16.280 --> 50:20.239
I find it helps to be cheery
and compliant.

50:22.639 --> 50:24.039
I am both those things.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.480
I encourage you to be the same.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.480
How can you be so sure
that this is the right thing?

50:35.280 --> 50:37.599
I'm sorry. I truly am.

50:38.559 --> 50:40.920
But if she comes, she does so alone.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.800
I don't wanna leave you here.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.480
We can still turn around.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.039
But I can't not do this.

50:49.039 --> 50:51.599
- You can, Lyra.
- What about Roger?

50:51.960 --> 50:53.360
And Sal?

50:53.880 --> 50:57.920
- They never got a chance to grow up.
- But it's not Roger and Sal, is it?

50:58.480 --> 51:01.320
And Roger's dead...
and Sal's gone.

51:02.320 --> 51:06.039
And it won't be Lyra and Pan.
You're leaving me here alone.

51:08.079 --> 51:09.519
What will I do?

51:10.320 --> 51:13.320
- But our dreams...
- I didn't have those dreams.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.280
They were your dreams.
I didn't even wanna come here.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.280
This is your choice.

51:19.519 --> 51:22.559
- But we're together.
- Not if you do this.

51:23.159 --> 51:27.039
Please. I can't betray Roger.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.760
It's my fault he's dead and now
he needs me.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.119
I need you too.

51:32.719 --> 51:34.400
Why can't you see that?

51:36.559 --> 51:41.039
- Where will I go?
- I'll find you, okay?

51:41.679 --> 51:45.719
I will go to the Land of the Dead
and I'll come back, and I'll find you.

51:46.239 --> 51:50.800
I'm not leaving you, okay?
I'm not leaving you.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.079
Not forever.

51:52.679 --> 51:56.400
Will and me will find a way out
of here and well go to Asriel's.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.760
Somehow, you've got to get there too...
but I have to do this.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.599
Then you've made up your mind.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.480
- You've chosen Roger over me.
- No, Pan. Please don't, don't do it.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.039
Oh, please.

52:13.599 --> 52:18.000
Please, there's no other way.
I've got to.

52:25.760 --> 52:27.000
I love you.

52:29.719 --> 52:32.039
Just go.

54:02.199 --> 54:03.800
My heart...
