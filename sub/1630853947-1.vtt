Ava Bravo.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.880
You are very far from home.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.000
You are in a cold
and desolate place.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.200
I am the only soul on Earth
who knows you are here.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.840
You are completely off-grid.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.360
No phones or Internet.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.640
All you have is
what's in your front pocket.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.800
This is my hunting cabin

03:27.960 --> 03:30.760
and you, Ava Bravo,
are about to be hunted.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.520
Five miles directly north
of this cabin,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.200
you'll find a lean-to.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.960
Inside is a shiny snowmobile,
gassed up, ready to go.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.400
It's your only way
off this mountain.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.960
You reach that snowmobile
before I get to you.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.760
It's game over for me.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.920
You escape to civilization

03:50.040 --> 03:52.320
and I am left stranded to die
in the woods.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.640
As an elite sportsman,
I insist on true challenge.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.920
So, I'll be hunting you
with limited ammunition.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.280
My rifle holds three bullets
and those three bullets

04:04.400 --> 04:06.720
are the only ammunition
in my possession.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.000
I get three chances
to take you down.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.680
That's it.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.240
Use this to your advantage.
Strategize, Ava Bravo.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.880
Two pieces of advice.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.600
First, don't just run off
in a straight line.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.480
Second, if you're ransacking
the cabin right now

04:24.600 --> 04:28.040
looking for a weapon,
you are wasting precious time.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
There is nothing here

04:29.280 --> 04:31.160
that you could
possibly weaponize.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.520
All you can do
is start running.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.800
Because right now, Ava Bravo,
I'm down in the basement.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.440
And I'm about to come up.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.720
10 Mississippi...

04:45.840 --> 04:48.840
9 Mississippi...

04:49.000 --> 04:52.240
8 Mississippi...

04:52.320 --> 04:54.800
7 Mississippi...

04:54.960 --> 04:57.440
6 Mississippi...

04:57.560 --> 04:58.640
5...

06:15.320 --> 06:16.480
Ah.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.480
Son of a bitch.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.240
Five miles directly north
of this cabin,

09:46.360 --> 09:47.480
you'll find a lean-to.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.640
Inside is a shiny snowmobile.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.800
What the fuck is this?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.480
Fucking crazy man.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.440
I'm a survivor,
here, now and forever.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.160
I'm one with the Creator.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.160
I found it. There it is.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.320
Ah!

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
Son of a bitch!

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
Psych.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.200
Fucking traps.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.720
Son of a bitch!

17:52.720 --> 17:54.080
Where am I?

17:59.880 --> 18:02.960
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.160
The son of a bitch brought me here.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.200
And the son of a bitch
will take me back.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.920
There it is.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.760
You can do it, you can do it. Come on.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.960
Don't worry, he's tied up.
Everything will be fine.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
Fuck!

21:47.280 --> 21:48.520
What'd you shoot out there?

21:52.040 --> 21:53.400
Figured you'd be hungry.

21:56.920 --> 21:57.960
More for me.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.920
Don't move!

22:09.080 --> 22:10.560
Well, here we are, Ava B.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.560
You are the first guest
to ever outsmart

22:14.680 --> 22:16.720
and outpower me.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.760
Where am I?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.240
Did my spikes get you at all?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.360
-Where am I?
-Hmm.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.920
No snowmobile out there, huh?

22:28.240 --> 22:30.600
Yeah, "psych."

22:30.720 --> 22:31.960
Hmm.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.080
Give me your phone.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.920
What phone?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.560
Give me your phone now.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.640
Didn't you listen?

22:37.760 --> 22:39.600
You have a fucking phone!

22:39.760 --> 22:42.000
You searched me and the cabin

22:42.160 --> 22:44.320
after you knocked my ass out, right?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.600
Did you find a phone?

22:48.560 --> 22:49.560
Okay.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.880
You tricked me
with your little footprints

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
in the snow.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
Then you whacked me,

22:55.160 --> 22:57.120
you dragged my fat ass
down the stairs.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.800
You avoid the trap.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.120
You do all that.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.160
But then you cuff my hands
in front of me.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.280
I mean, in the front.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.360
Kind of a dumbass mistake.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.920
How about que te meto
este pinche rifle por el culo?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.440
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
English, por favor.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.840
'Cause this essentially makes me
a one-armed man.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.920
One armed-man
can still do a lot of damage.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.000
You know,

23:24.840 --> 23:27.720
I had an actual one-armed man
up here last winter.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.080
And he did great.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.400
Well, until he didn't.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.040
Where am I?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.600
Huh? Tell me

23:37.720 --> 23:40.520
how to get out of here
or I'm gonna fucking kill you.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.800
Nah.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.520
If you had killing in you,

23:44.600 --> 23:46.400
you would have done it
at the start.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.040
You don't know
what I have in me.

23:50.760 --> 23:55.040
At some point up that mountain,
you realized you need me

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
to survive.

23:58.960 --> 23:59.960
Sit down.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.440
Let's not forget that.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.960
Sit down!

24:08.520 --> 24:10.320
No problemo, I say.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.000
You know, I had a tough choice
to make, too.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.440
I could've hidden.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.960
And bushwhacked you
when you came back.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.720
I could've choked ya
with these chains,

24:19.840 --> 24:20.880
but instead...

24:22.040 --> 24:23.720
I thought it would be nice
to talk.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.480
Have a little meal.
You know.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.280
Sorry, that it's just beans
and water.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.440
Well, I'm not interested.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.120
A Mexican
who doesn't want beans.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.480
-That's a first.
-Fuck you.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.040
So, what'd you shoot up there?

24:37.120 --> 24:39.560
Really, 'cause sound...
sound travels from miles up here

24:39.640 --> 24:41.800
so I knew
that you were still with us.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.760
Hmm? What was it?

24:47.080 --> 24:48.120
Okay.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.560
Doesn't matter.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.960
What does matter...

24:54.720 --> 24:56.400
is that you have now
squandered...

24:57.760 --> 24:59.680
...one precious round.

25:01.760 --> 25:03.360
You should just be careful

25:03.440 --> 25:05.080
that you don't waste
another shot.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.320
How about I waste a shot
right in your fucking face?

25:13.040 --> 25:15.760
Well, if you don't think
you need me to get out.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.880
Maybe, I just kill you

25:18.000 --> 25:20.320
and live in
this lovely cabin forever, hmm?

25:21.840 --> 25:23.080
Yeah, it is a nice escape.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.400
Gets a little lonely though.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.160
But you know
all about loneliness.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.520
Ava, I truly don't know

25:38.640 --> 25:41.280
what is gonna happen next
between us.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.720
And I just find that
so exhilarating.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.320
What's that?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.200
Fire off a couple of shots
for a test.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.960
It's a bird.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.280
Hey, birds fly into buildings
sometimes.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.160
Because they make
dumbass mistakes, too.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.240
Comin' up on 18 months now, huh?

26:19.040 --> 26:21.200
And you haven't aged a day.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.600
You look great.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.080
You all have something
in common.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.680
-Yeah, you hunt survivors.
-Yes.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.800
-Real brave, fucking asshole.
-You know, if anybody other than

26:50.880 --> 26:52.600
you were doing this, they'd be
in a rubber room right now.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.000
No, you need to shut up.
Here's what's gonna happen.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.120
- Hey, you're amazing.
- You have to shut up.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.520
-I had this war hero up here.
-Here's what... No, no, no.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.600
I'm gonna do
something even worse.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.320
I need to know how I got here!

26:59.720 --> 27:01.440
There are no roads.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.640
First, there was a snowmobile.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.240
Then a little sled.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.080
Where is it?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.600
The snowmobile.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.640
Come on,
I'm not gonna answer that.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.760
Maybe you wanna rethink
that answer.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.200
If I die, you die.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.680
- Oh, what is it?
- Don't...

27:58.320 --> 28:00.280
What?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.320
I don't know. I swear to God.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.640
- Shoot him.
- What?

28:09.720 --> 28:11.600
Shoot him now.
Shoot him!

28:15.720 --> 28:17.880
-What the fuck is happening?
-In here.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.240
Where are you going?

28:19.360 --> 28:21.680
♪

28:30.360 --> 28:31.360
Where are you?

28:31.480 --> 28:33.840
Get into the light,
so I can see you.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.920
Do what I say when I say it.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.680
Or I'm gonna open the door.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.720
- Bullshit.
- Come on.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.920
I have nothing to lose.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.520
Okay, asshole.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.280
Okay, stop, stop! Okay.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.680
You win.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.560
Back up.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.440
Against the wall, now!

28:53.560 --> 28:54.760
I was just trying to help.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.000
Who is it up there?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.880
How the hell should I know, huh?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.320
Some backwoods hillbilly.
Will you just shoot him?

29:04.520 --> 29:06.960
Fuck.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.560
Just shoot him.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.560
There's nothing here.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.640
-What is this?
-A tranquilizer.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.760
-This is useless.
-Just shoot the fucker!

29:27.520 --> 29:29.560
You look trapped, huh?

29:29.680 --> 29:32.080
Well, fucking improvise
something.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.240
I plan, I don't improvise.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.600
Of course.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.160
Because you never had to.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.000
Look, will you just shoot him?

29:43.480 --> 29:44.800
What the fuck are you doing?

29:47.440 --> 29:49.520
That door's not gonna hold forever.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.800
What is it?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.040
Hey!

30:20.160 --> 30:21.560
Hey!

30:38.240 --> 30:39.960
Help!

30:40.080 --> 30:41.440
Stop!

30:44.440 --> 30:46.720
Just shoot the fucker!

30:46.840 --> 30:48.000
Shoot him!

30:50.440 --> 30:51.840
If I die, you die!

31:04.320 --> 31:05.920
You fucking kill him.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.160
No, no, no.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.400
No.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.600
Come on!

31:24.840 --> 31:26.960
You have one left.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.800
Give me that fucking glove.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.560
You impress me at every turn.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.800
Take me to the snowmobile.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.640
Who was that, huh?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.880
Now, you shut up.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.800
Oh, God!

32:03.920 --> 32:06.880
Fuck.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.960
Keep moving.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.920
We gotta deal with this leg.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.360
I don't care about it.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.640
Look, I'm not gonna make it
to the snowmobile, alright?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.720
Alright, the bleeding's
not gonna stop

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
from all the fucking walking.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.680
Fuck you and fuck your leg.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.960
Come on!

32:25.960 --> 32:27.160
Do it.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.000
I'd rather go quick
than sit here and bleed out.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.760
Go on, pull it.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.960
That's what I thought.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.240
That big bastard's gonna wake up
any second.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.720
And he's gonna see
our very obvious tracks

32:44.840 --> 32:47.200
and he's gonna be looking
for revenge.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.760
That was a dumbass decision
you made not to finish him off.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.880
Dumbass.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.560
We're gonna move a lot faster

32:56.680 --> 32:59.680
if... if I'm not coming apart
at the seams, right?

32:59.800 --> 33:02.720
I got a first-aid kit
and it's right in the backpack.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.200
Fuck.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.720
Fuck, fuck.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.280
Fuck!

33:11.720 --> 33:12.920
You want me to sit down?

33:13.000 --> 33:17.520
Face down on your stomach
on to your arms.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.000
Do it!

33:21.880 --> 33:24.440
Oh, okay.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.560
This is smart.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.640
Yeah.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.880
-Don't move.
-Oh, that fucking hurts.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.240
Pretty ironic, huh?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.880
You saving me.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.880
I'm saving me.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.840
Yeah, here, pour a little
of that tequila on the wound

33:54.960 --> 33:57.320
and then a little into my mug
right here.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.920
Just a little taste
for the pain.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.480
Shut up.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.040
I guess I'll be fine.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.560
Don't move.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.040
I know who you are.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.560
You're that guy
at the barbecue king.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.960
King's Castle Barbecue, yeah.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.400
Buddy King.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.800
It's nice to, uh, meet you.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.600
You have like a hundred restaurants.

34:35.720 --> 34:40.040
155 restaurants
around the world.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.480
Your restaurant, it's people,

34:42.600 --> 34:43.840
isn't it, the barbecue?

34:43.960 --> 34:48.320
No, I don't serve human flesh
in my restaurants.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.600
I'm an elite sportsman,
not a cannibal.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.080
Well, I did eat that one guy.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.000
That was a long time ago,
it was really...

34:57.080 --> 34:59.240
It was really more
of a bucket list kinda thing.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.920
- Shut up!
- Ow!

35:04.120 --> 35:06.000
Done.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.720
-Don't move.
-Yeah.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.040
Don't move!

35:17.080 --> 35:18.360
All right, stand up.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.440
How did you get me here?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.160
Tell me the truth.

35:28.320 --> 35:31.200
Like I said,
first on a snowmobile

35:31.360 --> 35:32.800
and a sled
the rest of the way.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.520
-Before that.
-You mean...

35:35.640 --> 35:37.360
From my home.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.480
I spent a couple of months
learning your routine.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.240
You wake up, you put on
workout clothes,

35:42.360 --> 35:44.160
you grab a few bites of granola,

35:44.280 --> 35:45.520
you hop
on your fancy spinning bike,

35:45.680 --> 35:46.800
you go take a shower.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.080
Then you get dressed.

35:50.160 --> 35:51.560
Sometimes,
you don't get dressed.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.080
You work from home,
you cook for yourself,

35:53.160 --> 35:54.320
you watch TV at night.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.920
How did you get me here?

36:04.040 --> 36:06.120
You rarely leave your house
at night.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.920
The occasional, unpredictable
night-out with your girlfriends.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.840
Or when you take
your garbage out.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.200
Sunday nights, 9:05.

36:16.360 --> 36:17.880
In your purple robe.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.560
Then in the middle of the night,
I went into your bedroom,

36:21.720 --> 36:22.920
gave you a shot.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.920
A shot of what?

36:26.040 --> 36:27.840
Fentanyl and heroin.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.640
That tranquilizer
from the basement?

36:34.560 --> 36:35.640
Why did you undress me?

36:42.040 --> 36:44.320
Ow, oh.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.880
Get up!

36:46.040 --> 36:48.800
Take me
to the fucking snowmobile.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.000
Right now.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.360
Sure.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.600
Don't forget the bag.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.360
Oh.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.880
Hey.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.080
What is this?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.400
I keep seeing them.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.080
No idea.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.080
You want to freeze
or you wanna walk?

38:05.360 --> 38:09.960
I do a lot of research
so I can learn everything I can

38:10.040 --> 38:11.280
about my guests that come here.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.200
Guests?

38:13.280 --> 38:15.560
Yeah, you've told me.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.400
That creeping around
where I live,

38:17.520 --> 38:18.560
looking in my windows.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.360
Observation is a part
of that research, of course.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.680
But so is television,
and newspaper,

38:26.840 --> 38:28.000
and the Internet, and...

38:28.120 --> 38:30.640
and I read everything
that was written

38:30.800 --> 38:32.840
about what happened to you.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.440
But you never did
one interview.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.360
-And I never will.
-Why? I mean... look,

38:36.480 --> 38:39.640
there's something terrible
happened to you, right?

38:39.720 --> 38:41.440
And people wanna know
how you got out of it.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.160

39:24.120 --> 39:26.000

Oh.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.840

40:03.440 --> 40:06.960
You have issues socializing,
so I'll be you.

40:08.400 --> 40:13.360
"Buddy... how'd you start
a world-famous barbecue?"

40:14.640 --> 40:16.160
Great question, A.B.

40:17.560 --> 40:21.320
Rudy's Bar-B-Q,
just outside of San Antonio.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.520
Leon Springs, Texas.
You ever been there?

40:26.760 --> 40:29.160
My father took me
on a three-week road trip.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.080
And that was actually
the first time I met him.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.400
It was when he stole me
from my mom

40:33.440 --> 40:34.840
the day we left.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.040
He didn't even know my name.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.560
So, he would just say...
"You getting hungry, buddy?"

40:42.800 --> 40:45.800
Or... "You feeling tired,
buddy?"

40:46.880 --> 40:49.560
Anyway, so they go to Rudy's
and the kid eats

40:49.720 --> 40:53.280
all the cream corn
and then the next night,

40:53.400 --> 40:57.160
before they're leaving,
the kid's begging the father

40:57.280 --> 40:59.680
if they can go back to Rudy's.

40:59.800 --> 41:04.200
And he says, "Buddy, we can't go
to the same place twice."

41:06.160 --> 41:08.840
Oh, the kid starts crying
and he goes over,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.560
he hugs the father, and he looks
up at him, and he says...

41:14.520 --> 41:15.880
"Please, Dad."

41:17.760 --> 41:21.080
And that was the first
and the only time,

41:21.200 --> 41:22.800
he ever called him "dad".

41:26.920 --> 41:28.840
So, you got daddy issues?

41:30.400 --> 41:31.880
-What, you...
-Hey!

41:32.000 --> 41:33.880

to psychoanalyze me now?

43:05.480 --> 43:06.840

43:11.600 --> 43:13.120

Here's what we're gonna do,

52:11.680 --> 52:13.440
I find it really hard to believe

52:13.560 --> 52:15.800
that your snowmobile
is this far away.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.480
Yeah, well, I usually don't have
to hike it with a hole in my leg

52:18.600 --> 52:19.600
or at gun point.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.000
It's not that far, trust me.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.720
If I don't see
that fucking snowmobile

52:22.840 --> 52:27.120
in one hour, you are gonna see
this one bullet.

52:28.560 --> 52:31.480
Because I trust me
way more than I trust you.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.360
If you don't believe me...

52:36.760 --> 52:38.200
...fucking try me.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.640
One hour.

52:45.200 --> 52:46.280
It's that way.

52:53.320 --> 52:54.480
Move it.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.640
♪

53:15.080 --> 53:16.200
-Ava...
-Shut up.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.640
-Look, I just wan...
-Shut up.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.160
I'm sick of your bullshit.

53:44.240 --> 53:46.400
That thing you had to go
to take care of

53:46.520 --> 53:49.080
when I was in your pit,
what was it?

53:49.240 --> 53:51.280
I thought I supposed to shut up?

53:51.400 --> 53:52.560
As if that were possible.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.080
It was nothing.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.280
Huh?

54:00.400 --> 54:01.840
It wasn't the soldier?

54:03.640 --> 54:07.480
The one you brought up here
to kill, but obviously didn't.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.600
Not very elite.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.480
Seems like a dumbass mistake.

54:15.560 --> 54:16.560
Yeah, well, he's dead now.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
-Dead?
-Dead.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.080
-You sure?
-Sure.

54:19.160 --> 54:21.040
'Cause you keep looking
over your shoulder.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.160
Wouldn't be the first time
you thought you killed him.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.600
This would be twice now.

54:27.760 --> 54:29.280
You failed.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.840
What? What's the matter?

54:36.920 --> 54:39.200
Don't you like to be fucked up?

54:43.000 --> 54:44.880
You know,
I figured something out

54:45.040 --> 54:46.400
about your story, you know.

54:48.760 --> 54:51.840
You've killed before. Right?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.600
Maybe you didn't mean it.
That felt bad.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.640
Or maybe you did
and that felt better.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.840
But I'm guessing,
you got a little blood

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
on your hands from all that.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.600
Am I right?

55:01.720 --> 55:02.720
Is that what you think?

55:04.600 --> 55:06.640
Well, that's why you cry
yourself to sleep every night.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.880
Is that how you got out
of Albuquerque?

55:20.640 --> 55:22.520
Help! Help me!

55:22.680 --> 55:24.280
- Over here!
- Shut up!

- No!

-Woah, wait, wait.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.120
- She's crazy.
- Listen to me guys.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.600
Woah, woah, woah, lady.

55:39.720 --> 55:40.800
-Please, help me.
-Hey, I've been kidnapped.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.480
Oh, I... I need your help.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.360
Please, don't listen to him.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.760
Look at me. Look at me,
look at what she did.

55:46.920 --> 55:49.000
Hey, no, no, no. Please wait.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.040
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

Don't hit me again,
don't hit me again.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.600
Okay, look.
Look at what she's done.

55:55.760 --> 55:56.800
-He's lying.
-I'm really sorry.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.200
-That is not true.
-Okay, I'm sorry.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.720
Listen to me, he's lying.

55:59.840 --> 56:01.920
He kidnapped me, he tried
to kill me. I need help.

56:02.040 --> 56:03.720
Listen, hey, my name
is Buddy King.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.120
Alright, I own a bunch
of barbecue restaurants.

56:05.240 --> 56:06.680
I do TV commercials.
Buddy King.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.800
- You're Buddy King?
- That's right, nice to meet you.

56:08.880 --> 56:12.280
He's Buddy King. From TV.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.760
-The commercials, yes.
-Barbecue Castle.

56:13.880 --> 56:14.840
- Nice to meet you, yeah.
- Yes.

56:15.000 --> 56:15.760
That's right
King's Castle Barbecue.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.000
And she's trying to kill me.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.720
You're speaking in Spanish.
You speak Spanish, right?

56:18.800 --> 56:20.880
Can you get me out of here
in that thing?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.760
I need you listen to me.
This guy has kidnapped me.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.400
Don't listen to him. He tried
to kill me. He's a hunter.

56:26.480 --> 56:28.480
Hey, hey, she's loco,
she's loco.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.920
What she's saying?
Do not trust her.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.200
Do not trust her, guys.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.880
- Please, help me.
- Don't believe her.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.960
Wait.
Buddy King is a people hunter?

56:38.080 --> 56:39.400
Yes, he tried
to kill me. He's lying.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.120
Look, wait,
she... listen to me, listen.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.000
She's
an animal rights activist, okay?

56:43.120 --> 56:44.200
And she's probably not too happy

56:44.320 --> 56:45.320
that you guys
have been killing animals.

56:45.400 --> 56:48.240
No, don't listen
to him. Call the police.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.680
If I was the bad one here,
I wouldn't ask you that, right?

56:51.760 --> 56:54.440
- Please.
- I can't. No signal.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.440
Just for music.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.040
- Music.
- Okay.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.240
Okay, um...

57:00.320 --> 57:03.400
Okay.
Hands down. I won't hurt you.

57:03.520 --> 57:04.360
No, no. What's she saying?

57:04.480 --> 57:05.760
Get me out of here in that thing.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.160
No, don't put
your hands down.

57:07.280 --> 57:09.400
No, do not trust her.
Don't trust her.

57:09.480 --> 57:11.480
I'll give you this gun.
Point it at him.

57:11.600 --> 57:12.720
Hey!

57:12.880 --> 57:15.520
Hey, hey, hey, no, no.

57:15.640 --> 57:19.960
I'll give you this gun.
Point it at him.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.160
-Okay?
-No, no, don't take...

57:21.320 --> 57:22.360
Look at me, look at me,
don't take the gun.

57:22.440 --> 57:23.600
-No, no, no, here.
-Yes.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.840
Careful with that asshole.

- Look. Guys, just look.
- Don't move.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.440

- What do we do?

57:33.480 --> 57:34.520
Look, look right here.

57:34.680 --> 57:37.360
Get in the snowmobile. Let's go.

57:37.440 --> 57:38.880
Just look at the back of my head.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.280
Can you see that?

57:40.400 --> 57:42.040
Look at my lip,
look right here.

Hey, yeah.

1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:18.720
Yeah.

1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:20.120
Yeah.

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:36.640
You never hand a knife
to somebody with the blade

1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:37.680
towards them.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.040
You always offer
the handle first,

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:40.600
so flip that around.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.160
Hey, throw me my bag now.

Your story.

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:12.360
Albuquerque, Ava, I just...

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:13.960
Look, my snowmobile
is right over that ridge.

1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:15.320
You're almost there.

1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:19.280
Hey, sit at the edge
of the fucking snowmobile.

1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:21.400
Go ahead, right there.

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:22.720
We got it.

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.520
There you go,
sit down and look at me, now.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.000
Let me see you, look at me.

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:28.440
Okay, Albuquerque.

1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:34.480
He came down the stairs...

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:37.040
No, no, you don't start a story
in the middle.

1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:39.280
I want the whole thing,
beginning, middle, and end.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:40.640
I want the tell-all.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.400
But you didn't tell me
your whole story.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:49.480
If you want my story,
the whole thing,

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.440
then it's only fair
you do the same, right?

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:01.920
You'll say the whole story?

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.040
Yep.

1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:08.120
Deal, deal.

1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:10.000
Okay, where was I?

1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:11.320
You went back to Rudy's...

1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:12.440
Right, right, right.

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:14.720
-Then what?
-The police came.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:15.960
And they asked me if...

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.960
...the man who stole me
from my mother's

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:22.600
was my real father.

1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:26.160
And I actually didn't know
so, I... I shrugged.

1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:32.320
My father reached for his ID
and they shot him.

1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:36.360
That was it.

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:38.840
Okay.
The end.

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:41.920
That was boring as shit,
but it was a nice appetizer.

1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:44.720
Now for the main course.

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.400
The whole story.

1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:56.920
I was at my mailbox
when a delivery van pulled up.

1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:02.200
Mmm, he hopped out of the van
and said, "Good timing."

1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:05.120
Then slid the side door open.

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:09.760
"Your package is in here
somewhere."

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.040
I had to reach up for it.

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:16.760
And in one second...

1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:20.880
someone grabbed me
and pulled me inside.

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.200
Next thing I remember,
I was waking up in the basement.

1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.840
It was hot down there.

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.400
Dark, no windows.

1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.080
When he'd come down uh,

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:45.000
to either bring food
or... rape me...

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:50.640
...he opened the door
at the top of the stairs,

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:52.960
and for one second, this...

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:58.600
bright light from above

1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:00.840
shined down.

1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:03.800
Ah.

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:05.720
Oh, but then,

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:09.800
he'd lock the door behind him
and came down.

1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.840
Hmm.

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.640
One time,
he didn't lock the door.

1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:24.880
He just went to get something
from the other corner

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.160
of the basement
and the bright light

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.640
just lit up the stairs.

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:36.440
I thought I could get out.

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:40.320
So, I ran.

1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:42.680
And I got out.

1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:47.560
What, that's it?

1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:55.440
I told you,
there were no fancy tricks,

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:57.280
no ninja skills.

1:04:57.400 --> 1:04:58.880
He made a dumbass mistake.

1:05:02.280 --> 1:05:04.720
What happened?

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:16.920
He...

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:19.800
He brought down...

1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:24.480
he brought down a young girl.

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:26.440
She was only 17.

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:28.840
She was...

1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:36.280
She was beautiful,
kind, smart...

1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:39.640
and scared.

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:46.400
It...

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:49.520
It didn't matter
what he did to me.

1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.160
Just...

1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:54.640
Just it didn't matter.

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:58.080
It was listening to him
doing that to her.

1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:02.640
Her crying.

1:06:04.080 --> 1:06:06.440
Her screaming.

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:09.840
I knew I had to get us
out of there.

1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:12.400
I felt so responsible for her.

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:15.200
I had to get her out of there.

1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:21.240
So, the day
he left the door open...

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:28.080
and the light just shone down,
I yelled.

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:31.040
"Run!"

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:34.040
And we ran.

1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:36.920
I made it out of the house.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:39.920
She didn't.

1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:45.320
I hear her screams every day.

1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:52.520
We both killed someone
we didn't want to.

1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:56.840
We're the same.

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:03.080
Okay.

1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:04.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.600
Alright, I respect that you
tried that.

1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:13.040
I appreciate you telling me
your story.

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:16.760
I feel really connected to you
right now.

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:17.760
I don't know.
I don't wanna sound corny,

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.560
but...

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:21.640
I do wish the day could go on
forever.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.240
But all things come to an end,
so...

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:34.040
Let's go.

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:40.040
What?

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.000
It's only fair you get to see
the finish line.

1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:45.080
It's the way
it's supposed to be.

1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:46.400
Go on.

1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:49.080
♪

1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:26.400
You'll appreciate this.

1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:36.120
I can't believe it.

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:38.280
I knew it, I knew it.

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:39.880
-Ava, listen.
-I knew I couldn't believe you.

1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:41.240
You motherfucker.

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:44.520
You son of a bitch.

1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:47.320
Hey, things might not be
as dark as they seem right now.

1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:48.880
All this?

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.920
This whole journey?

1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:52.120
You...

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:54.120
You were fucking
stalling for time

1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:56.280
until you could kill me.

1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:59.360
All your talk about fair play,
your rules,

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:01.640
your fucking snowmobile.

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:03.480
They were all fucking lies.

1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:05.400
They were all fucking lies!

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:08.160
-I'm not going in there again.
-Ava, stop.

1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:11.920
Fuck you!
Fucking asshole! Fuck you!

1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:16.160
No, no, you were never
gonna let me go.

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.720
You just want me
to walk you circles to play

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:19.160
your fucking little game.

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.560
Okay, you just shut up
for a minute and listen.

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:27.920
I admit, yes.

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.240
This whole time
I have been stalling.

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:33.240
So, I can get the upper hand.

1:09:33.400 --> 1:09:35.480
Okay, that just took
a little time.

1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:37.480
-Okay?
-Fuck you.

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:38.920
Right,
something happened out there

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:42.440
and I've had to be smarter,
and quicker, and craftier

1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:43.800
than I have been in years.

1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:45.280
Yeah, well, good for you,
imbecile.

1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:46.920
We... hey, will you just
hear me out?

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.920
We both
got our baggage, right?

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:52.880
And it just made us both a...

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.200
a couple
of fucked up loners, right?

1:09:55.920 --> 1:09:57.320
Just stacks the deck against us.

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:03.920
We had
an interesting start, right?

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:06.800
And I don't know if we could
ever trust each other.

1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.200
I mean, I don't even know
if that's possible.

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:10.920
I... but what I do know...

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.800
is that we don't have
to be alone anymore.

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:17.000
♪

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:26.960
All gassed up.

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:28.080
Ready to go.

1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:30.960
Son of a bitch!

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.320
Was it here all the time?

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:37.240
All this fucking time?

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:41.120
We both deserve a nice escape.

1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.800
And I am not talking
about my cabin.

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:45.520
I got a lot of money.

1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:47.240
We can go anywhere we want.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.320
Anywhere you want.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:07.000
So, I've decided
to let you decide.

1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:09.520
You can stay here with me

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.280
or you can jump
on that snowmobile.

1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.760
Ride on out of here.

1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.000
I won't come for you,
honest to God.

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.160
Your choice.

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:42.680
Well, that stings.

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:48.120
You really think
that I can just let you drive

1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:51.000
out of here and leave, huh?

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:53.440
I'd never be free of you.

1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:56.720
What...

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000
How the fuck
are you still alive?

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:09.400
Are you gonna kill me
with my mug?

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:10.480
Shit.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:19.360
No, with your knife.

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:25.760
Hey, Buddy...
we're not the same.

1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:30.320
