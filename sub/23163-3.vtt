WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.196
I'm sure other people don't
get this preferential treatment.

00:02.253 --> 00:05.245
<i>Well, most other people haven't
witnessed a handful of murders.</i>

00:08.960 --> 00:11.861
She's deaf. I have to locate
this guy named Wilkins.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.294
<i>If he finds out she's alive,</i>

00:13.364 --> 00:15.889
he could try and shut her up
about the bank massacre.

00:15.967 --> 00:18.094
<i>Hi, guy.
You're Magnum?</i>

00:18.169 --> 00:19.500
You think
just 'cause you're deaf

00:19.570 --> 00:21.470
you have to take on
the whole world by yourself?

00:21.539 --> 00:23.473
<i>I don't need you.
Yes, you do!</i>

03:19.113 --> 03:22.139
Excuse me. Do you have the
key to the safety deposit area?

03:22.216 --> 03:23.683
It's open.

03:23.951 --> 03:25.350
Excuse me.

03:26.887 --> 03:28.411
The key
to the safety deposit area?

03:28.489 --> 03:29.820
The room is open.

03:29.890 --> 03:31.289
Thanks.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.351
<i>Frank, I gotta clean outside.</i>

03:58.419 --> 03:59.579
Okay.

04:08.696 --> 04:10.061
Get back! Get back! Get back!

04:10.131 --> 04:12.292
Get back! Put the gun down!

04:12.833 --> 04:15.996
Take it easy. Easy.

04:16.837 --> 04:20.738
Everything in that bag.
Everything! Hurry up!

04:27.248 --> 04:28.579
Get back.

05:00.281 --> 05:02.772
<i>Jack, police!</i>

05:09.857 --> 05:11.347
<i>Come on, it's a great view!</i>

05:11.425 --> 05:13.188
<i>Yeah, it's a great view
of a Chinaman's hat,</i>

05:13.260 --> 05:15.319
but what I needed
was pictures of Ed Barton.

05:15.396 --> 05:16.829
<i>He's there, and you can see him</i>

05:16.897 --> 05:18.125
handing the other guy
an envelope.

05:18.199 --> 05:20.667
<i>Someone is there, and what he's
holding might be an envelope.</i>

05:20.734 --> 05:21.758
<i>Then again,
it might be a Twinkie.</i>

05:21.836 --> 05:23.497
<i>These pictures won't hold up
in court, Thomas.</i>

05:23.571 --> 05:26.870
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not
going to be able to pay you.</i>

05:28.242 --> 05:29.504
What?

05:30.144 --> 05:33.636
<i>Carol, I spent two days on
surveillance getting these photos.</i>

05:33.714 --> 05:35.978
<i>We can only pay
for what we can use, Thomas.</i>

05:36.050 --> 05:38.848
<i>I'm sorry, you know that.
I don't believe this!</i>

05:38.919 --> 05:41.319
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.

05:41.388 --> 05:45.518
Maybe if you performed some other
tiny service. What other service?

05:45.593 --> 05:47.720
<i>I don't know, but some service
I could put on a voucher.</i>

05:47.795 --> 05:49.592
<i>Like, maybe, uh...</i>

05:49.930 --> 05:52.558
I'm on my way right now
to a lineup.

05:54.802 --> 05:55.996
You want me to be in a lineup?

05:56.070 --> 05:57.765
<i>Well, it's a service.</i>

05:57.838 --> 05:59.362
Carol?
What?

06:00.608 --> 06:03.008
What's really going on here?

06:03.077 --> 06:04.135
What do you mean?

06:04.211 --> 06:05.576
You know good and well
what I mean.

06:05.646 --> 06:07.204
<i>No, I don't.</i>

06:07.281 --> 06:08.441
Okay.

06:08.782 --> 06:12.240
I mean that you must have
had some good reason

06:12.319 --> 06:14.310
<i>for getting me down here
besides these photos,</i>

06:14.388 --> 06:17.152
<i>but as usual,
you won't say what it is.</i>

06:17.224 --> 06:19.351
<i>I mean, Carol,
did it ever occur to you</i>

06:19.426 --> 06:22.259
to just ask me
for what you want?

06:22.963 --> 06:24.430
Just ask me without any games.

06:24.498 --> 06:29.026
<i>Don't you think that if it was
really important to you,</i>

06:29.470 --> 06:32.098
that I'm probably
going to say yes?

06:34.608 --> 06:36.542
Well...

06:36.810 --> 06:39.210
There was a kind of a favor.
No.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.941
You don't even know
what I'm gonna ask!

06:41.015 --> 06:45.042
<i>I know that if you've gone this far to
avoid asking me, you knew what I'd say.</i>

06:45.119 --> 06:48.350
Thomas... No and that's my
final word on the subject.

06:49.623 --> 06:52.251
<i>So I can
still get paid for the photos,</i>

06:52.326 --> 06:54.055
but we just have
to call them something else?

06:54.128 --> 06:55.720
Exactly.

06:55.796 --> 06:57.627
<i>Oh, Linda, thank you for coming.</i>

06:57.698 --> 07:00.895
This is Thomas Magnum.
He's a kind of a consultant.

07:01.468 --> 07:03.095
Hi.
Hi.

07:03.370 --> 07:05.065
<i>Uh, Debbie. Please.</i>

07:07.775 --> 07:11.142
Linda was in that bank
yesterday during the shooting.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.606
I thought the papers said
there weren't any witnesses.

07:13.681 --> 07:14.773
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

07:14.848 --> 07:16.816
<i>Well, at least she agreed to
have her identity protected.</i>

07:16.884 --> 07:18.442
At least?
No police guards.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.953
She doesn't want it
and HPD didn't push it.

07:21.021 --> 07:23.649
But she's not completely
resistant to the idea

07:23.724 --> 07:25.783
of some private protection.

07:31.131 --> 07:33.929
So you need
a consultant bodyguard?

07:34.001 --> 07:35.491
That's right.

07:38.806 --> 07:41.274
<i>You can see them, Linda,
but they can't see you.</i>

07:41.342 --> 07:43.139
Can they see me in here?

07:45.846 --> 07:47.507
<i>No, they can't.</i>

07:53.387 --> 07:55.082
I keep forgetting.

07:55.422 --> 07:56.616
What?

07:59.393 --> 08:01.258
Is she deaf?
Yeah.

08:01.862 --> 08:04.126
She lost her hearing in a
boating accident five years ago.

08:04.198 --> 08:06.166
But she can read lips.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.265
He's not there.

08:09.336 --> 08:10.803
Are you sure?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.137
Did...

08:14.742 --> 08:18.075
<i>Linda, did the killer get
a look at you at the bank?</i>

08:18.779 --> 08:21.577
<i>No, he doesn't know
anyone else was there.</i>

08:22.082 --> 08:23.913
Excuse us a minute.

08:24.518 --> 08:25.712
Carol?
Hmm?

08:25.786 --> 08:30.155
How does an assistant D.A. Get involved
in a case that isn't even a case yet?

08:30.224 --> 08:32.317
I have a friend at the police
department who called me.

08:32.393 --> 08:34.418
<i>Now, don't you think that
she could use a little help?</i>

08:34.495 --> 08:37.123
<i>Okay, maybe she doesn't realize
the trouble she could be in.</i>

08:37.197 --> 08:39.495
But I can't keep an eye on her
24 hours a day.

08:39.566 --> 08:42.000
I am not a bodyguard!

08:42.068 --> 08:43.297
<i>Okay, forget it.</i>

08:43.370 --> 08:45.600
I didn't even say forget it.

08:47.574 --> 08:50.008
Maybe she can stay
at the estate.

08:50.577 --> 08:52.340
If we can convince her.

08:52.413 --> 08:54.438
<i>Please, if you're discussing me,</i>

08:54.515 --> 08:56.813
I really don't merit
all of this concern.

08:56.884 --> 09:00.650
I'm sure other people don't
get this preferential treatment.

09:00.954 --> 09:04.788
<i>Well, most other people haven't
witnessed a handful of murders.</i>

09:04.858 --> 09:06.917
You deserve a little help.

09:13.701 --> 09:15.999
The second man from the right.

09:18.038 --> 09:20.563
He was the one
who did the shooting.

09:28.082 --> 09:32.018
The police picked Wilkins up
a few blocks from the bank.

09:32.453 --> 09:35.980
<i>He had over $5,000 in cash
on him.</i>

09:36.056 --> 09:39.924
<i>Carol figures with your ID,
that should pretty well nail him.</i>

09:40.027 --> 09:43.155
<i>I was going to ID him, but
when I saw him, I panicked.</i>

09:43.263 --> 09:45.094
I decided I just couldn't do it.

09:45.165 --> 09:47.190
What changed your mind?

09:49.603 --> 09:52.071
<i>I said,
"What changed your mind?"</i>

09:52.272 --> 09:55.298
You reminded me that
he killed four people!

09:59.747 --> 10:01.612
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to, uh...</i>

10:01.682 --> 10:04.310
Forget it.
It happens all the time.

10:06.053 --> 10:09.352
You're going to be picking up
your muffler assembly in a minute.

10:09.423 --> 10:12.051
<i>What? Your muffler, it's coming loose.</i>

10:13.594 --> 10:16.620
<i>Well, I did kind of drag it, coming
out of the driveway this morning,</i>

10:16.697 --> 10:19.757
but it sounds...
It seems fine to me.

10:25.272 --> 10:26.899
Did we lose it?

10:28.142 --> 10:30.702
The vibration in the floor
is gone.

10:40.888 --> 10:43.482
<i>Mr. Magnum, you have
truly exquisite taste.</i>

10:43.557 --> 10:44.990
<i>Oh, um...</i>

10:47.628 --> 10:49.755
<i>Uh, call me Thomas.
Uh, Linda, this is Keo.</i>

10:49.830 --> 10:52.856
<i>Keo, this is Linda Andrews.
She'll be staying here for a while.</i>

10:52.933 --> 10:54.366
Hello.
Hi.

10:55.235 --> 10:58.568
A sixth century Vishner
from the Temple of Angkor?

11:01.775 --> 11:04.039
Private collectors
just don't find these.

11:04.111 --> 11:05.908
<i>Oh, they're around.</i>

11:06.847 --> 11:09.714
<i>Uh, actually, uh...
They're not all mine.</i>

11:11.018 --> 11:14.215
<i>There's this other guy
who, uh, stays here.</i>

11:14.588 --> 11:17.284
<i>Well, we kind of... We kind
of, uh, share the place.</i>

11:17.357 --> 11:19.825
<i>Uh, Linda, I'm talking to you.</i>

11:20.260 --> 11:21.659
<i>Uh, Linda?</i>

11:25.098 --> 11:27.726
Higgins! This is...

11:27.801 --> 11:31.430
<i>I've already introduced myself
to Miss Andrews, Magnum.</i>

11:32.039 --> 11:34.940
I've also thoroughly explained
your position here.

11:35.008 --> 11:38.239
What did he tell you?
That you were just leaving.

11:38.312 --> 11:39.779
I was thrilled
when Carol called to say that

11:39.847 --> 11:42.281
<i>you would be staying with us here
at Robin's Nest, Miss Andrews.</i>

11:42.349 --> 11:43.782
Thank you.

11:43.851 --> 11:44.977
Yes.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.084
<i>I, uh...</i>

11:47.855 --> 11:50.756
<i>I hope you won't consider it
an imposition,</i>

11:51.592 --> 11:52.991
<i>but, uh...</i>

11:53.961 --> 12:00.196
<i>I'm, uh, most anxious to
hear your comments and, uh...</i>

12:01.602 --> 12:03.160
<i>So, I...</i>

12:05.205 --> 12:06.604
Well...

12:08.442 --> 12:10.205
That's terrible.

12:12.846 --> 12:15.508
I think it's really quite...

12:15.582 --> 12:20.349
<i>Aside from the obvious deep-seated
and bizarre psychological symbolism,</i>

12:20.420 --> 12:22.217
what is it?
It's Primitive.

12:22.289 --> 12:23.415
I can see that.

12:23.490 --> 12:25.048
The style is Primitive.

12:25.125 --> 12:28.993
Which is why I'm most interested
in Miss Andrews' opinion of it.

12:29.062 --> 12:30.359
<i>Naturally, there's no way
you could know</i>

12:30.430 --> 12:32.591
<i>that she is an internationally
acclaimed artist,</i>

12:32.666 --> 12:36.432
the reigning master of neo-American
Primitive in the Islands.

12:37.471 --> 12:38.699
<i>Right, well...</i>

12:38.772 --> 12:41.002
I'm sure you two
have plenty to talk about.

12:41.074 --> 12:44.510
<i>Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I am late for a ball game.</i>

12:45.412 --> 12:47.903
Each to his own
form of primitive.

13:05.432 --> 13:06.990
Good morning.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.595
Hi.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.074
To thank you
for the breakfast invitation.

13:19.746 --> 13:21.304
You don't like it.

13:21.381 --> 13:23.645
Are you kidding? I love it.

13:24.117 --> 13:27.245
<i>I mean, no one's
ever done this for me before.</i>

13:27.854 --> 13:29.617
I haven't done a straight
portrait since college.

13:29.690 --> 13:30.714
It was good practice.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.452
Magnum!

13:32.726 --> 13:36.423
What in God's name have you
done with Mr. Masters' muffler?

13:37.064 --> 13:38.463
I can explain.

13:38.532 --> 13:40.363
<i>Uh, as we were
coming over here yesterday,</i>

13:40.434 --> 13:41.867
a mongoose ran across the road.

13:41.935 --> 13:44.836
<i>Thomas tried to avoid it,
but he couldn't.</i>

13:45.639 --> 13:49.200
A mongoose destroyed
a Ferrari exhaust system?

13:50.610 --> 13:52.475
A very big mongoose.

13:53.547 --> 13:56.038
<i>Uh, I was gonna mention it to
you, but I didn't get the chance.</i>

13:56.116 --> 13:58.812
Thomas? Thomas?
Why is the gate open?

13:59.586 --> 14:00.746
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

14:00.821 --> 14:03.051
I always open it at this hour
for the staff.

14:03.123 --> 14:04.954
Can you make
some other arrangement?

14:05.025 --> 14:06.959
<i>Carol, what's wrong?</i>

14:09.696 --> 14:13.598
Jack Wilkins has managed to make
bail. They had to let him out.

14:22.564 --> 14:25.431
<i>$50,000? How can they
set his bail that low?</i>

14:25.494 --> 14:28.657
Because he owns property and
because he doesn't have a record!

14:28.730 --> 14:31.756
<i>To a judge, that means that Wilkins
will probably show up at the arraignment.</i>

14:31.833 --> 14:33.266
When's that?

14:33.335 --> 14:34.632
Two weeks.

14:34.703 --> 14:36.034
Two weeks?

14:36.104 --> 14:38.937
<i>You mean he can go anywhere
he wants, do anything?</i>

14:39.007 --> 14:40.031
Yes.

14:40.108 --> 14:42.770
I've discarded your bacon.
It was burned to a crisp.

14:42.844 --> 14:45.972
<i>Higgins, I'm not really concerned about
my bacon or my dirty kitchen right now.</i>

14:46.047 --> 14:49.483
<i>I wasn't passing a judgment,
merely preventing a fire.</i>

14:49.551 --> 14:51.644
I have a feeling there's
something you're not telling me.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.086
<i>If I knew anything else,
I'd tell you.</i>

14:54.156 --> 14:55.919
<i>Miss Andrews,
perhaps you should rest.</i>

14:55.991 --> 14:57.959
I'll have breakfast
sent to your room.

14:58.026 --> 15:00.017
<i>I don't need to be
sent to my room,</i>

15:00.095 --> 15:03.155
and I don't need to be
protected from the truth.

15:03.231 --> 15:05.256
<i>Linda, I promise you,</i>

15:05.333 --> 15:09.167
<i>as soon as I know anything
more, I'll tell you. Okay?</i>

15:12.374 --> 15:14.274
I've got to go.

15:14.976 --> 15:17.069
I'll walk you to your car.

15:23.885 --> 15:28.584
<i>So, Carol, what do you know
that you're not telling her?</i>

15:28.690 --> 15:30.590
I don't know anything for sure.

15:30.659 --> 15:31.683
But?

15:31.760 --> 15:34.991
But I think that Wilkins
suspects we have a witness.

15:35.063 --> 15:37.395
His attorney has been
asking a lot of questions.

15:37.465 --> 15:38.454
What have you told him?

15:38.533 --> 15:40.228
<i>Well, we're not required
to tell him anything, yet.</i>

15:40.302 --> 15:41.291
But?

15:41.369 --> 15:42.996
But the fact that
he's even asking

15:43.071 --> 15:45.539
has to mean that
Wilkins is suspicious.

15:45.607 --> 15:47.507
<i>Thomas, could...</i>

15:47.576 --> 15:51.171
<i>Yeah, I'd better keep an eye
on him. What's his address?</i>

15:52.914 --> 15:55.940
<i>I can't really
give you his address, legally.</i>

16:09.497 --> 16:11.192
It's not here.

16:12.634 --> 16:15.501
<i>It's on the yellow sheet,
the top left hand corner.</i>

16:15.570 --> 16:17.561
<i>Oh, I got it. Uh, 226...</i>

16:18.373 --> 16:21.137
Is this Hester Street
or Chester Street?

16:21.610 --> 16:23.510
<i>I don't know, Thomas.
I'm not looking at it!</i>

16:23.578 --> 16:27.036
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Carol,
but your handwriting is awful.</i>

16:28.283 --> 16:30.683
It's Chester!
That's a C-H.

16:30.752 --> 16:33.118
Are you sure?
That looks like...

16:34.222 --> 16:36.087
Chester.
That's it all right.

16:36.157 --> 16:37.454
Thank you.

16:37.525 --> 16:40.688
<i>Now, you understand that
any surveillance of Wilkins</i>

16:40.762 --> 16:44.289
<i>is unofficial, it's illegal
and it's unbillable.</i>

16:47.502 --> 16:49.094
You're welcome.

16:50.906 --> 16:55.070
<i>Something I've noticed over
the years about movie bad guys.</i>

16:56.778 --> 16:58.143
<i>They're always bad.</i>

16:58.213 --> 17:01.080
<i>The henchmen, the hit men,
the big bosses,</i>

17:01.917 --> 17:04.646
<i>they all have that
one-dimensional evil.</i>

17:06.121 --> 17:10.079
<i>We don't like to think about the
fact that they may have families</i>

17:10.157 --> 17:14.151
<i>or about what their families have
to go through because of them.</i>

17:16.564 --> 17:20.227
<i>I could see that Jack Wilkins was
just that kind of scary enigma,</i>

17:20.301 --> 17:22.236
<i>and I was counting
on the possibility</i>

17:22.304 --> 17:26.330
<i>that he would have the same universal
household problems we all have.</i>

17:28.376 --> 17:30.071
Hi. Bugs-Be-Gone.

17:30.145 --> 17:31.510
What?

17:31.646 --> 17:33.614
<i>Um, 226 Chester.</i>

17:33.682 --> 17:36.742
<i>I'm here to do your, uh,
bug investigation.</i>

17:37.719 --> 17:40.051
I didn't call about any bugs.

17:40.188 --> 17:41.951
You're kidding.
No.

17:42.223 --> 17:45.420
<i>Boy, I can't believe the
office has messed me up again!</i>

17:45.493 --> 17:47.893
<i>Look, I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

17:48.663 --> 17:52.565
<i>Listen, while I'm here, uh,
do you want me to check it out?</i>

17:52.634 --> 17:55.125
We got this $15 special
this week.

17:59.307 --> 18:01.207
<i>Here, I've got it.</i>

18:09.150 --> 18:11.243
<i>Wilkins isn't living there.</i>

18:11.319 --> 18:14.117
<i>I mean, why wouldn't any of
his clothes be in the closets?</i>

18:14.189 --> 18:16.783
<i>Thomas, this better not be another
one of your cockamamie stories.</i>

18:16.858 --> 18:19.759
<i>Rick, I'm telling you, Linda
could be in a lot of trouble.</i>

18:19.828 --> 18:21.796
You know what I mean
about her being deaf and all.

18:21.863 --> 18:23.854
<i>And all?
That's it, she's deaf.</i>

18:23.932 --> 18:25.832
<i>Well, she better be.</i>

18:25.900 --> 18:27.697
<i>Look, wait a minute.
That's not what I meant! I...</i>

18:27.769 --> 18:30.499
<i>Okay, guys, where is she?</i>

18:31.039 --> 18:32.563
<i>Oh, T. C., thanks for coming.</i>

18:32.640 --> 18:34.107
Are you kidding?

18:34.175 --> 18:36.268
A chance to meet Linda Andrews.

18:36.344 --> 18:38.175
Where is she?
She's not here yet?

18:38.246 --> 18:40.806
<i>Well, I didn't exactly say
she'd be here.</i>

18:40.882 --> 18:42.941
<i>But you said if I came over,
I'd get a chance to meet her.</i>

18:43.018 --> 18:44.849
And you will. I promise.

18:44.919 --> 18:46.250
Why do you want to meet her?

18:46.321 --> 18:49.313
<i>Oh, I want to get her to sign these
prints of hers that I bought last year.</i>

18:49.391 --> 18:51.086
She's an artist?

18:51.659 --> 18:54.389
You've never heard
of Linda Andrews?

18:54.562 --> 18:56.359
You told me she was deaf.

18:56.431 --> 18:57.523
She is deaf.

18:57.599 --> 19:00.466
You told me that she'd be
happy to sign these prints.

19:00.535 --> 19:01.627
I'm sure she will.

19:01.703 --> 19:04.228
<i>She's at the estate right now, and
she could be in a lot of trouble.</i>

19:04.305 --> 19:07.172
<i>Now, are you guys
gonna help her or not?</i>

19:07.242 --> 19:09.403
Does it ever occur to you

19:09.477 --> 19:12.708
<i>to just ask for what you want,
without any games?</i>

19:13.681 --> 19:16.707
<i>Don't you think that if it's
really important to you,</i>

19:16.785 --> 19:19.345
I'd probably say yes?

19:24.559 --> 19:26.049
All right.

19:26.127 --> 19:28.186
<i>I have to locate this guy
named Wilkins,</i>

19:28.263 --> 19:29.662
<i>and if he finds out she's alive,</i>

19:29.731 --> 19:33.167
he could try and shut her up
about the bank massacre.

19:34.769 --> 19:38.102
<i>All right, I'll see what I
can find out about Wilkins.</i>

19:38.640 --> 19:40.005
Whatever.

19:41.409 --> 19:44.139
Great. I knew
I could count on you guys.

19:44.212 --> 19:47.010
<i>Now, could I borrow
the Club's fumigator?</i>

19:55.223 --> 19:56.656
Children!

20:01.129 --> 20:03.290
<i>Hello? Oh, hi, Tony.</i>

20:03.398 --> 20:05.127
<i>No, he's not here.</i>

20:06.734 --> 20:09.396
I'm not supposed
to give that out.

20:13.875 --> 20:15.934
Just hold on a minute.

20:20.448 --> 20:21.847
<i>Tony, here's the number.</i>

20:21.916 --> 20:23.747
It's 5-5-5...

20:32.060 --> 20:34.824
<i>Tell him that I miss him,
okay? Bye.</i>

20:35.263 --> 20:37.663
I've just about had it with you!

20:39.567 --> 20:41.626
I don't want you kids
running in the house!

20:41.703 --> 20:43.398
<i>Go outside to play, now!</i>

20:43.471 --> 20:45.996
Why?
Because I said so!

20:49.377 --> 20:50.969
Is Jack there?

20:51.813 --> 20:53.371
<i>Who's this?</i>

20:53.448 --> 20:56.645
<i>My name is Thomas Magnum, and
I need to talk to Jack Wilkins.</i>

20:56.718 --> 20:59.312
It's about
what happened yesterday.

20:59.921 --> 21:02.151
<i>You can talk to me about it.</i>

21:02.757 --> 21:04.884
<i>Oh, that's okay.
Thanks anyway.</i>

21:04.959 --> 21:06.688
<i>Uh, wait a minute.</i>

21:06.995 --> 21:09.589
<i>Give me a number
where he can call you.</i>

21:09.664 --> 21:11.427
<i>1944,</i>

21:11.766 --> 21:15.532
<i>I was in the Pacific, suffering through
the tedium of waiting to go into battle,</i>

21:15.603 --> 21:18.697
and so I spent many hours
with my watercolors.

21:19.541 --> 21:22.101
<i>There was this Island maiden,</i>

21:22.844 --> 21:26.075
<i>a fetching girl,
who seemed intrigued with me,</i>

21:26.147 --> 21:29.446
<i>and one day she literally
forced me into her hut,</i>

21:29.951 --> 21:34.047
where I discovered a most magnificent
display of Primitive panurgy.

21:35.757 --> 21:39.420
<i>I proceeded to spend several
wonderful weeks with the girl,</i>

21:39.494 --> 21:41.792
gaining invaluable knowledge.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.523
<i>I mastered her technique,</i>

21:45.333 --> 21:48.564
but I could never rival
her extraordinary talent.

22:00.081 --> 22:04.541
She was indeed a gifted artist.

22:14.329 --> 22:15.455
Mmm.

22:15.530 --> 22:19.227
Now I find myself in the
presence of another great artist.

22:21.035 --> 22:25.404
<i>And curiously, you're very
reminiscent of that Island girl.</i>

22:29.510 --> 22:33.002
<i>That is to say, uh, strictly
in the artistic sense.</i>

23:01.943 --> 23:03.376
Married?

23:04.312 --> 23:05.506
No.

23:08.716 --> 23:10.479
I've observed that
you only use sign language

23:10.551 --> 23:13.850
when you find it difficult
to speak your thoughts.

23:15.456 --> 23:17.856
<i>No, I don't believe there is a
woman of any special importance</i>

23:17.925 --> 23:20.223
in Magnum's life at the moment.

23:21.195 --> 23:24.596
<i>Mr. Higgins, it really isn't
that heavy a question.</i>

23:24.666 --> 23:26.395
I'm just curious.

23:28.870 --> 23:31.031
<i>Betsy, I can't do it.</i>

23:31.673 --> 23:33.698
<i>I can't operate. I couldn't
even hold a knife steady.</i>

23:33.775 --> 23:36.175
<i>Robert...
Look at my hands.</i>

23:36.244 --> 23:38.212
<i>They won't hold still.</i>

23:39.447 --> 23:41.472
<i>Why must I always
fail these people?</i>

23:41.549 --> 23:45.315
I've so enjoyed watching
your progress as an artist.

23:45.386 --> 23:48.378
I saw your first Kaiina Point
painting at the Windward Gallery.

23:48.456 --> 23:51.289
That was three years ago.
Nobody knew who I was then.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.259
<i>Yes, well, I did.</i>

23:54.362 --> 23:57.456
<i>Oh, Keo, we'll have tea
in here, please.</i>

23:57.565 --> 23:58.589
<i>Yes, Mr. Higgins.</i>

23:58.666 --> 24:01.692
Then you can watch television in the kitchen.

24:01.769 --> 24:03.498
<i>I, uh, felt</i>

24:03.571 --> 24:07.063
<i>this room would give us the space to
continue working during tea, if you like.</i>

24:07.141 --> 24:09.609
<i>Thanks, but I'm ready
for a break.</i>

24:10.511 --> 24:13.674
<i>Thomas didn't give you any idea
what time he'd be back, did he?</i>

24:13.748 --> 24:15.215
<i>Uh, no.</i>

24:16.017 --> 24:17.814
<i>Miss Andrews, I don't know
how much you know about</i>

24:17.885 --> 24:20.285
<i>private investigators as a lot,</i>

24:21.189 --> 24:24.249
but I've found them
to be most irresponsible.

24:33.735 --> 24:35.669
Do you have an aspirin?

24:36.304 --> 24:38.864
<i>Why, yes,
of course we have aspirin.</i>

24:40.541 --> 24:42.805
I'll get you one right away.

25:06.365 --> 25:08.196
How could you let Linda leave?

25:08.267 --> 25:10.428
I didn't let her leave.

25:10.503 --> 25:11.697
She said
she wasn't feeling well.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.739
<i>I got her an aspirin,
and she went to lie down.</i>

25:13.806 --> 25:15.797
<i>A short time later,
I noticed she was gone.</i>

25:15.875 --> 25:18.002
She must have taken the keys
to the car from my desk.

25:18.077 --> 25:21.103
But you must've known
she'd be upset by the news!

25:21.180 --> 25:23.876
I had no idea
there was any news.

25:24.617 --> 25:27.108
<i>Oh, you're right. I mean,
how could you have known.</i>

25:27.186 --> 25:29.677
<i>I'm sorry, I'm blaming you
when I should be blaming myself.</i>

25:29.755 --> 25:31.586
<i>No, you're entirely right.
I'm the one to blame.</i>

25:31.657 --> 25:32.954
I should have been
more sensitive to her...

25:33.025 --> 25:34.686
The important thing right now
is just finding her.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.990
Is the Ferrari back yet?
It's still in the shop.

25:37.063 --> 25:39.327
<i>It's running fine, but they can't
fix the muffler until tomorrow.</i>

25:39.398 --> 25:40.626
We'll have to take the jeep.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.565
<i>No, you're not coming with me!</i>

25:42.635 --> 25:44.466
I most certainly am.

25:44.537 --> 25:45.731
<i>Higgins, you can't!</i>

25:45.805 --> 25:48.365
I need you to stay here and
let Carol know what happened

25:48.441 --> 25:50.238
and notify the police
that Linda's missing.

25:50.309 --> 25:53.745
<i>And besides, I'm expecting
an important phone call.</i>

25:54.480 --> 25:56.243
You found Wilkins?

25:57.617 --> 25:59.050
<i>Maybe. Look, if he calls,</i>

25:59.118 --> 26:01.609
just make him believe he can
only get to her through me.

26:01.687 --> 26:04.554
You may depend on it.
When you find her...

26:04.624 --> 26:06.023
I'll call.

26:16.969 --> 26:19.028
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

26:19.105 --> 26:22.939
<i>I couldn't really expect Linda to
tell anyone where she was going.</i>

26:23.009 --> 26:25.000
<i>At least not on purpose.</i>

26:25.478 --> 26:28.936
<i>But I had a hunch that she might
have left a very visible clue</i>

26:29.015 --> 26:31.415
<i>without even knowing it herself.</i>

26:31.584 --> 26:34.917
I have some interesting Keene Prints
that might be more in your price range.

26:34.987 --> 26:37.854
<i>No, thanks. I'm only
interested in Linda Andrews.</i>

26:37.924 --> 26:39.414
<i>Uh, how long
have you had this one?</i>

26:39.492 --> 26:42.757
This was the first one she
painted after the accident.

26:42.828 --> 26:46.992
Some think she started the Kaiina
Point series as a sort of therapy.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.025
That's where
she lost her hearing.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.465
Do you have any more of these?

26:52.538 --> 26:53.835
We did have 28.

26:53.906 --> 26:58.605
<i>There are six left, including a set
of three that's a bargain for $22,500.</i>

26:58.678 --> 27:00.009
<i>This one,</i>

27:04.850 --> 27:07.944
and these. We just received these last week.

27:10.356 --> 27:12.381
It looks like she spends
a lot of time there.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.550
I wouldn't know.

27:13.626 --> 27:16.060
I try not to get involved in the
personal lives of our artists.

27:16.128 --> 27:17.186
Thanks for your time...

27:17.263 --> 27:19.288
I could get you a lithograph
at a reduced rate.

27:19.365 --> 27:21.060
<i>Thanks, I already have one
of her originals.</i>

27:21.133 --> 27:22.691
Really? Which one?

27:22.768 --> 27:25.134
<i>Private Investigator Number One.</i>

27:26.539 --> 27:29.531
I just stood there dumbfounded.

27:29.609 --> 27:32.043
<i>This reporter, he sticks his mike in my face,</i>

27:32.111 --> 27:35.171
<i>"and he says," Miss Baldwin,
could you comment on the rumor</i>

27:35.248 --> 27:38.809
"that the leak on Linda
Andrews came from your office?"

27:38.884 --> 27:40.146
Do you think it's true?

27:40.219 --> 27:41.948
Absolutely not.

27:45.992 --> 27:47.789
<i>I don't know, maybe.</i>

27:48.427 --> 27:50.691
I just can't believe it is.

27:51.464 --> 27:53.557
I don't know what difference
it makes now anyway.

27:53.633 --> 27:56.727
<i>The point is if I'd told Linda
the whole truth in the first place,</i>

27:56.802 --> 27:58.736
she might have been
prepared for this.

27:58.804 --> 27:59.930
I know what you mean.

28:00.006 --> 28:03.908
If I had been with her to temper
the blow of the news report...

28:04.043 --> 28:05.305
<i>Oh, Jonathan.</i>

28:05.378 --> 28:08.575
I guess everyone wants to take the
blame for what's happened to her.

28:08.648 --> 28:10.479
Everyone but Wilkins.

28:11.417 --> 28:14.079
<i>If Thomas calls,
you tell him I'm at HPD.</i>

28:14.153 --> 28:16.747
I want to be there in case
there's a lead on Linda or Wilkins.

28:16.822 --> 28:18.016
They can legally arrest him?

28:18.090 --> 28:20.490
No! They can't
legally do anything.

28:20.559 --> 28:23.084
<i>But if they find him, at least
they can keep an eye on him</i>

28:23.162 --> 28:25.187
from a discreet distance.

28:27.433 --> 28:29.367
Robin Masters' estate.

28:30.870 --> 28:32.804
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

28:33.673 --> 28:34.970
Yes.

28:35.441 --> 28:37.204
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

28:38.244 --> 28:40.838
That will be fine.
I'll tell him.

28:43.916 --> 28:46.441
Magnum has an appointment
with Mr. Wilkins in an hour.

28:46.519 --> 28:48.316
Where?
I'll call the police.

28:48.387 --> 28:49.615
<i>Well, he may lead us to Linda.</i>

28:49.689 --> 28:52.089
<i>No, no, no. If we tip him off, he
may send someone else after her.</i>

28:52.158 --> 28:53.557
<i>Well, we have to do something.</i>

28:53.626 --> 28:57.153
You're going to drop me off
at Milo's Muffler Shop.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.179
<i>Hi, guy.</i>

29:51.984 --> 29:53.542
You're Magnum?

29:55.721 --> 29:57.621
You're not Wilkins.

29:58.290 --> 30:00.724
You sound... You sound
different than before.

30:00.793 --> 30:03.626
Hay fever.
It comes on suddenly.

30:09.001 --> 30:12.300
<i>I, uh, don't think
we've actually met.</i>

30:12.838 --> 30:14.465
The name's Nelson.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.235
Are you sure you don't have
a squad car on your tail

30:16.308 --> 30:18.105
because of those straight pipes?

30:18.244 --> 30:19.768
Straight...

30:20.045 --> 30:22.343
<i>Oh, no.</i>

30:23.282 --> 30:28.117
<i>Look, uh, I promised there'd
be no police and there aren't.</i>

30:28.888 --> 30:30.685
<i>Now, where's Wilkins?</i>

30:30.756 --> 30:32.246
Something came up.

30:32.324 --> 30:34.849
He said you could
give me the message.

30:34.927 --> 30:37.919
If he's not interested
in the whereabouts...

30:40.800 --> 30:42.597
<i>If he doesn't want to know
where the girl is stashed,</i>

30:42.668 --> 30:45.136
I'll sell the info to the cops.

30:46.472 --> 30:49.373
<i>Once she's in
their protective custody,</i>

30:49.809 --> 30:51.902
he won't be able to get to her.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.604
Wait a minute!

31:02.988 --> 31:05.752
Century Motel. Room 12.

31:07.092 --> 31:09.322
Jack'll talk to you there.

31:11.096 --> 31:12.563
<i>Thanks, guy.</i>

31:50.703 --> 31:53.103
<i>Officer, I can explain
about the muffler.</i>

31:53.172 --> 31:55.265
<i>Uh, there was a mongoose,</i>

31:55.774 --> 31:58.743
a rather large mongoose...

31:58.811 --> 32:00.972
<i>I know it sounds preposterous,
but...</i>

32:01.046 --> 32:03.537
<i>What's the room number,
Mr. Higgins?</i>

32:03.616 --> 32:05.311
Room number?

32:15.828 --> 32:19.093
You promised not to follow me.
What if Nelson saw you?

32:19.164 --> 32:21.291
<i>He didn't! I know
what I'm doing, Jonathan.</i>

32:21.367 --> 32:23.232
And we can't afford
to waste any time.

32:23.302 --> 32:24.997
Thomas?

32:25.437 --> 32:27.302
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:29.375 --> 32:31.605
Higgins?
Why are you here? Why?

32:31.677 --> 32:34.805
Ice Pick found out that Wilkins
had a room at this motel.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.313
Why are you here?

32:36.382 --> 32:37.747
<i>Please don't arrest him,
Officer.</i>

32:37.816 --> 32:41.308
This Magnum impersonation is
just some harmless hero worship.

32:41.387 --> 32:43.548
Did you find any evidence
of Wilkins in the room?

32:43.656 --> 32:46.147
<i>Yeah, he's been here. In fact,
he's even got a lead on Linda.</i>

32:46.225 --> 32:48.750
We found that by the telephone.

34:53.118 --> 34:56.143
<i>If I'd wanted you here,
I'd have left a note.</i>

34:59.091 --> 35:03.118
<i>In a way, you did. Why'd you leave
the estate? You were safe there!</i>

35:03.195 --> 35:04.594
Safe?

35:06.999 --> 35:08.967
You don't know what it's like
to have to depend on people

35:09.034 --> 35:11.525
to take care of you
all the time.

35:11.603 --> 35:13.366
You're never safe anywhere.

35:14.039 --> 35:18.339
I learned that five years ago. I
don't need to learn it again from you.

35:18.777 --> 35:20.244
Just go away.

35:20.312 --> 35:21.904
I'm not gonna...

35:23.949 --> 35:25.211
Look at me!

35:25.284 --> 35:27.013
I'm not gonna
leave you here alone.

35:27.086 --> 35:28.383
<i>I can take care of myself!
No, you can't!</i>

35:28.454 --> 35:30.888
You can't take care of yourself
against people like that!

35:30.956 --> 35:32.287
Not alone.

35:32.357 --> 35:34.018
<i>Look, you think
just because you're deaf</i>

35:34.093 --> 35:36.186
you have to take on
the whole world by yourself?

35:36.261 --> 35:38.126
<i>I don't need you.
Yes, you do!</i>

35:38.197 --> 35:41.928
And I'm not gonna let you
down. Even if you want me to.

35:49.975 --> 35:51.340
When I...

35:56.782 --> 36:00.582
<i>After the accident,
when I lost my hearing,</i>

36:02.121 --> 36:04.055
I felt so helpless.

36:05.424 --> 36:10.225
<i>Now, I promised myself I was never
ever going to feel that way again.</i>

36:35.854 --> 36:38.118
I'm trying to remember.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.852
We must have had
a dozen inquiries today.

36:40.926 --> 36:42.393
You don't think I'd help
if I could?

36:42.461 --> 36:47.091
Perhaps we can narrow it down. We're
only interested in the men who inquired.

36:47.966 --> 36:50.127
<i>Yes, tall with a mustache.</i>

36:50.202 --> 36:53.535
He comes to mind because he claimed
to have one of her originals.

36:53.605 --> 36:56.039
I don't believe it because
I didn't know the title.

36:56.108 --> 36:59.839
And he didn't look like
the right sort of Line 23.

36:59.912 --> 37:01.277
Line 23?

37:01.346 --> 37:03.405
<i>IRS, 1040, total income.</i>

37:03.482 --> 37:06.451
<i>I mean, he was dressed
like an out-of-work teenager.</i>

37:06.518 --> 37:08.213
<i>Okay, okay.
Now, can you think</i>

37:08.287 --> 37:11.723
of any other non-proper Line
23s who came in here today?

37:13.458 --> 37:16.222
<i>Yes, there was another off-the-wall
type that came in later.</i>

37:16.295 --> 37:18.490
And he asked the same question
as the one with the mustache.

37:18.564 --> 37:19.963
What? What did they ask?

37:20.032 --> 37:23.934
If Linda painted all of her
Kaiina Points at the same location.

37:24.303 --> 37:25.702
Let's go.

38:07.344 --> 38:09.141
Sorry I cried all over you.

38:09.212 --> 38:11.146
<i>Oh, feel free anytime.</i>

38:12.149 --> 38:13.912
What do you think
we ought to do?

38:13.984 --> 38:15.576
<i>Well, I think you ought
to go to the police.</i>

38:20.157 --> 38:21.715
Stay down!

38:24.528 --> 38:26.018
They followed you here!

38:26.096 --> 38:29.691
<i>No, they didn't, but this
isn't the time to discuss it.</i>

38:31.768 --> 38:32.962
Looks like there's three of 'em.

38:35.806 --> 38:38.673
Sorry. We're going out the back. Come on.

38:39.676 --> 38:41.940
No! I can't! I can't swim!

38:47.417 --> 38:50.147
It's okay.
There's nowhere to go anyway.

38:50.220 --> 38:51.778
Why don't you
shoot back at them?

38:51.855 --> 38:54.050
Let them think you're alone.

38:54.591 --> 38:56.991
You go to the window and watch.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.159
What are you doing?

39:08.238 --> 39:10.138
<i>Don't look at me, look at them!</i>

39:10.207 --> 39:13.870
I'll let you know if I'm going
to say something important.

39:16.113 --> 39:18.980
They've taken cover
behind the logs.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.043
They're loading a rifle.

39:24.554 --> 39:26.749
I don't need a blow by blow.

39:31.762 --> 39:33.389
"She may not..."

39:36.033 --> 39:37.466
"Herself."

39:39.202 --> 39:41.932
"I've a feeling
he's in there with her."

39:43.240 --> 39:47.108
<i>"Nelson, you go back."</i>

39:51.148 --> 39:53.582
Is anybody moving this way yet?

39:56.820 --> 39:57.844
Huh?

39:57.921 --> 39:59.650
Is anybody moving this way?

39:59.723 --> 40:00.712
No!

40:00.791 --> 40:03.692
<i>Wilkins is talking to Tony,
but I can't see his lips.</i>

40:03.760 --> 40:06.228
<i>Wait a minute, Thomas,
one of them is gone!</i>

40:06.296 --> 40:08.856
He must be
moving around the house.

40:17.007 --> 40:18.804
Here comes Wilkins.

40:20.243 --> 40:21.767
Come here.

40:34.825 --> 40:37.157
How long can we hold them off?

41:01.752 --> 41:03.242
Linda?

41:12.996 --> 41:14.395
Linda!

41:18.535 --> 41:22.027
<i>Linda, come on! Come on!</i>

41:44.261 --> 41:45.694
Help me!

42:57.234 --> 42:58.701
Thomas!

43:03.440 --> 43:05.101
I have to go outside.
No!

43:05.175 --> 43:07.370
I have to get closer to him!

43:13.717 --> 43:17.448
<i>When I tell you, you fire
two shots. Do you understand?</i>

43:17.520 --> 43:19.215
Say it!
Two shots.

43:19.289 --> 43:21.553
And then wait two minutes.
Wait two minutes.

43:21.625 --> 43:23.456
And fire two more.

43:23.526 --> 43:25.960
<i>That should leave you
one left, just in case.</i>

43:26.029 --> 43:27.155
Thomas.

43:27.230 --> 43:29.960
<i>No, it's okay.
I'll come back for you.</i>

43:36.773 --> 43:37.865
Now!

45:27.817 --> 45:30.445
<i>Hey, Thomas, are you guys okay?</i>

45:34.157 --> 45:35.624
We're fine.

45:35.859 --> 45:37.724
<i>Nice outfit, Higgins.</i>

45:57.781 --> 45:58.975
<i>Hey,</i>

46:00.083 --> 46:02.916
I thought I told you
I'd be back for you.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.718
<i>Yeah, I know. I never listen.</i>
