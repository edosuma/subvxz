MILLER: OK, Poole,
walk me through it.

46:04.172 --> 46:08.271
12:30am,
Wallace exits the Petersen

46:08.305 --> 46:12.673
and gets in the last vehicle
of a three-car convoy.

46:12.705 --> 46:17.305
It's a Suburban. It's driven
by Greg Young, aka G-Money.

46:17.338 --> 46:18.638
Right.

46:18.672 --> 46:20.773
In the first vehicle

46:20.806 --> 46:22.940
is an off-duty
Inglewood police officer,

46:22.972 --> 46:24.773
Reginald Blaylock.

46:24.806 --> 46:30.972
He pulls out, blocks
the traffic on Fairfax, OK?

46:31.006 --> 46:34.372
Now, Biggie's security,
Eugene Deal,

46:34.404 --> 46:37.005
walks to the garage exit,

46:37.037 --> 46:38.805
where he comes face to face

46:38.839 --> 46:41.506
with a man in a blue suit
and a bow tie,

46:41.539 --> 46:44.306
who Deal identifies as a member
of the Fruit of Islam.

46:44.338 --> 46:46.805
- The Nation of Islam's...
- Security guards.

46:46.838 --> 46:48.605
Yeah, exactly.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.506
Deal shows the man
that he's armed.

46:50.539 --> 46:52.538
The man leaves.

46:52.571 --> 46:55.805
Deal then notices,
as do many other eyewitnesses,

46:55.838 --> 47:01.271
a black sedan parked
facing southbound on Fairfax.

47:01.305 --> 47:02.773
- Correct?
- Yeah.

47:02.806 --> 47:05.239
And it's in front
of a white vehicle,

47:05.272 --> 47:10.472
the occupants of which shoot
video of the incident, OK?

47:10.504 --> 47:13.538
Deal then gets in the second car
of the convoy.

47:13.572 --> 47:16.505
Excuse me.
Kenneth Story is driving.

47:18.404 --> 47:19.939
Puffy is sitting

47:19.971 --> 47:23.772
in the passenger seat.

47:23.806 --> 47:26.573
Then they pull
just past the kerb.

47:26.606 --> 47:30.739
Biggie's SUV
then pulls in behind.

47:30.772 --> 47:32.172
OK?

47:32.205 --> 47:34.906
On the sidewalk
are approximately 15 people

47:34.939 --> 47:37.171
who had attended the party
at the Petersen.

47:37.204 --> 47:40.338
DJ Quik, Kurupt
and, er, what's that...

47:40.371 --> 47:42.405
- Wait, Foxy Brown.
- Foxy Brown, here.

47:42.438 --> 47:46.773
Now, while Biggie's car idles
at the exit of the garage,

47:46.805 --> 47:49.138
he signs an autograph for a fan

47:49.172 --> 47:52.172
and then he speaks to a woman
who approaches the vehicle.

47:52.205 --> 47:55.573
Now, 12:49am.

47:55.606 --> 47:58.606
Puffy's car pulls out,

47:58.639 --> 48:00.439
heads north on Fairfax.

48:00.472 --> 48:04.039
Eugene Deal,
Wallace's head of security...

48:04.072 --> 48:04.905
Security.

48:04.938 --> 48:06.406
..he advises Kenneth Story,

48:06.439 --> 48:09.072
blow the light,
for security reasons, OK?

48:09.105 --> 48:11.806
Puffy's car goes through
that yellow light

48:11.838 --> 48:13.104
and turns left onto Wilshire.

48:13.137 --> 48:17.638
But Biggie's car
stops at the red light.

48:17.671 --> 48:19.138
That lane, exactly.

48:19.171 --> 48:24.338
The second he stops at
this red light, a white SUV...

48:26.238 --> 48:29.971
..pulls in parallel
to Biggie's vehicle

48:30.004 --> 48:31.672
and stops, blocking it.

48:31.706 --> 48:35.171
Now, at this exact same second,

48:35.204 --> 48:38.904
our shooter,
in the black sedan...

48:38.937 --> 48:40.639
- MILLER: The Chevy Impala SS.
- Yes.

48:40.671 --> 48:43.605
He speeds north on Fairfax,

48:43.638 --> 48:47.271
pulling parallel to the right
side of Biggie's car...

48:47.304 --> 48:49.705

It's garbage.
We can't use any of it.

48:58.806 --> 49:02.005
So, look, either the shooter
got lucky

49:02.037 --> 49:07.139
or, I don't know, he coordinated
it in some other way.

49:07.937 --> 49:12.138
If Officer Gaines
or other cops advised,

49:12.172 --> 49:14.639
they would know
to avoid cells, obviously.

49:14.672 --> 49:16.139
Yeah.

49:27.472 --> 49:29.406

01:00:48.337 --> 01:00:49.838
