Many parents in the community

some photographs.

Obviously these will probably be
photographs of the suspects.

Of course, suspects unofficially
at this point, although many believe

in this triple murder
of the three 8-year-old boys.

when these guys were arrested?

I was surprised about Jason

01:52.696 --> 01:54.949
because he's, like, the quiet one
of them all.

Jessie Misskelley and Damien Echols,

were asking for clothing

02:25.688 --> 02:29.859
so they could give it to the dogs
to pick up scent,

02:30.067 --> 02:34.488
the bandana here was the only thing
that I had in my household

02:34.655 --> 02:39.869
that had Stevie's scent on it.
I've never washed it.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.347
I was walking the route
to take Stevie to school,

03:00.556 --> 03:03.225
and I checked him out,
I believe, at 2:30.

03:03.434 --> 03:07.730
Stevie told me a hundred times,
probably a thousand, on the way home:

03:07.938 --> 03:12.151
"I love you, mama." "I love you too, son."
And it was just constant.

03:13.402 --> 03:17.281
We got home, first thing I asked him,
"Do you have any homework?"

03:17.489 --> 03:19.700
He said, "I did, but I did it in school."

03:19.867 --> 03:23.037
And he hung his homework
on the refrigerator.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.040
And Michael Moore came up,

03:26.248 --> 03:30.085
and they started asking,
could Stevie go to Michael's house?

03:30.294 --> 03:33.881
And I said, "No, I'm getting ready
for work, I'm cooking supper."

03:34.048 --> 03:35.758
Both of them,
you know, begging:

03:35.925 --> 03:38.928
"Please, please, please,
we'll be back," and all that.

03:39.929 --> 03:44.141
I gave in and I said, "Okay." I said,
"But, boy, you better be home by 4:30.

If you're not, I'm gonna ground you
for two weeks from that bike."

I'm gonna say Christopher
probably arrived at the house

03:54.610 --> 04:00.032
around 3:35 maybe,
and he asked me if Stevie was there.

04:00.991 --> 04:05.996
I told him, I said, "I'm surprised you didn't run
into him because him and Michael just left."

04:06.163 --> 04:10.125
He left and he was gonna go
searching for Stevie and Michael.

Still hadn't arrived.

"Well, let's go ahead and leave."

Terry walked in, to the phone,
didn't say hi, bye, nothing.

He just walked to the phone,

04:38.279 --> 04:41.448
and I took two pieces of candy
to the car and Amanda was there,

04:41.615 --> 04:46.870
and I asked her, "Where's Bubba?"
And she said, "Mama, we can't find him."

that he was dead.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.330
that somebody was behind bars

14:32.539 --> 14:38.670
and that they didn't have to be quite
as scared as they were. They were guilty.

14:46.928 --> 14:50.515
<i>OPERATOR</i> [OVER <i>PHONE]: This call originates
from an Arkansas correctional facility.</i>

14:50.682 --> 14:53.143
<i>I have a prepaid call from:</i>

14:53.310 --> 14:56.146
DAMIEN: Damien.
OPERATOR: <i>An inmate</i> at Varner <i>Unit.</i>

14:56.354 --> 14:58.023
<i>If you wish to accept-- Thank you.</i>

14:58.857 --> 15:02.319
LORRI: Damien and I
probably have 5000 letters

15:02.485 --> 15:06.865
that we've written to each other
over the past 15-- Fourteen, 15 years.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.076
You know, it's the way
we got to know each other.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.204
I saw the film Paradise <i>Lost,</i>
which is a documentary

15:13.413 --> 15:15.874
that was made about the original trial.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.084
I was living in New York City
at the time

15:18.251 --> 15:21.254
and I saw it at probably
the second time it was screened.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.299
We were just watching TV
the night we were arrested.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.509
We were in the bedroom,
turned the light off.

15:26.676 --> 15:31.848
LORRI: To hear Damien talk in that
film, he reminds me so much of myself.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.894
DAMIEN [OVER <i>PHONE]: Did she tell you whenever
she awarded herself the first-place prize</i>

15:36.102 --> 15:37.687
<i>and rode in a parade?</i>

15:37.896 --> 15:41.441
<i>She had this sign on the side
of a car that's saying "first place"</i>

15:41.650 --> 15:45.570
<i>and it's got a blue ribbon on it.
And it was not even a contest!</i>

15:45.737 --> 15:46.738
[LAUGHING]

15:46.905 --> 15:49.824
<i>She just gave herself "first place."</i>

15:50.033 --> 15:51.409
[Hr]

15:51.576 --> 15:55.080
LORRI: After a series of letters,
writing, corresponding with him,

15:55.246 --> 15:57.123
and then I cared deeply about him.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.502
And the next thing I know,
I'm in Arkansas.

16:00.710 --> 16:06.049
DAMIEN: <i>When I was</i> a <i>real little kid, I had,
uhh,</i> a <i>pet turtle for</i> a <i>while. A box turtle.</i>

16:06.257 --> 16:10.053
<i>Did you do</i> any <i>painting on its</i> shell?
<i>I most certainly did not.</i>

16:10.261 --> 16:11.846
We did.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.725
Seeing the film, you realize
something has gone wrong.

16:15.934 --> 16:19.187
You don't get the full picture
because there's so much to the story,

16:19.396 --> 16:21.815
as we've learned,
as it's unfolded over the years.

16:22.023 --> 16:26.945
I was struck by the fact that these people
didn't commit these crimes.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.073
They don't have the right people
in prison.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.830
REPORTER: Questions about
whether justice was served

16:37.038 --> 16:39.207
have loomed in this case
since the verdicts.

16:39.416 --> 16:45.630
The HBO documentary Paradise Lost
gave the case worldwide attention.

16:45.839 --> 16:50.844
I am so glad to see so many people here,
people who are interested in this case.

16:51.052 --> 16:57.642
When I started to write <i>Devil's</i> Knot,
my friends said, "Mara, they did it."

16:57.809 --> 17:02.355
And I said, "Well, that may be,
and if that's true I'm gonna find out."

17:03.356 --> 17:08.778
This was probably the first
crowd-sourced criminal investigation

17:08.944 --> 17:12.449
in history,
is about the only way to describe it.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.452
The case was supposedly solved.
If it was an open case,

17:15.660 --> 17:20.415
the West Memphis Police wouldn't be
required to make available documents.

17:20.623 --> 17:25.086
The West Memphis Police put together
an incredibly large investigation.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.757
Even if a lot of it was nonsense
and rumors.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.968
So we could take on the case,
we could begin to ask the questions.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.679
We can look at Jessie's confession
and we could say:

17:34.888 --> 17:36.723
"Wait a second,
what did he really say

17:36.890 --> 17:39.517
compared to what he was claimed
to have said?"

17:39.684 --> 17:43.730
LEVERITT: Right from the start, after Jessie
Misskelley made his statement to police,

17:43.897 --> 17:46.066
it was recorded, transcribed.

17:46.232 --> 17:50.195
<i>And then it was immediately</i> leaked
<i>to The Commercial Appeal.</i>

17:52.030 --> 17:55.784
STIDHAM: I read the confession on the front
page of the Memphis Commercial <i>Appeal</i>

17:55.992 --> 18:02.373
just like everybody else did.
And it seemed like it happened.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.709
When we were appointed
by the court in 1993,

18:04.876 --> 18:07.170
we thought it wasn't gonna be
a jury trial.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.006
We thought it was gonna be a plea.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.093
As I got deeper into the case
and looked at things,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.095
they just didn't start making sense.

18:15.303 --> 18:20.350
Misskelley's versions
of what happened changed wildly,

18:20.517 --> 18:23.728
and he couldn't get the story right
every time or any time.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.192
JESSIE SR.: Everybody round here
knew that Jessie didn't do it.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.403
He didn't like Damien,
he was scared of him.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.116
He, uh, stayed away from him
as much as possible.

18:37.117 --> 18:43.248
Well, he wasn't too good in school.
Had to take him out of school

18:43.414 --> 18:45.333
and I got him started
doing mechanic work.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.419
He caught on pretty good.

18:48.628 --> 18:54.008
<i>JESSIE</i> [OVER PHONE]: <i>When I was growing up, my dad
always taught me, you know... Tell the truth.</i>

18:54.175 --> 18:57.679
<i>Tell the police the truth. I thought
the police was there to help you.</i>

18:58.221 --> 19:00.974
<i>That's when they, uhh,
started questioning me.</i>

19:01.182 --> 19:03.810
<i>Gary Gitchell and Bryn Ridge was,</i>

19:03.977 --> 19:06.479
<i>you know, asking me some questions.
You know, about the kids.</i>

19:06.646 --> 19:08.773
<i>And I tell them,
"I didn't know nothing about it."</i>

19:08.982 --> 19:14.404
<i>The only thing I knew was what, you know...
What I was told from another guy.</i>

19:14.612 --> 19:19.450
<i>I kept telling them the whole time,
"I wanna go home. I wanna go home."</i>

19:19.659 --> 19:23.037
HILL: Certainly one of the reasons
behind why he confessed is

19:23.246 --> 19:25.206
that he's borderline
mentally retarded.

19:25.415 --> 19:29.169
He was trying to compose a story
as though he was there.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.713
He just didn't have the details.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.424
JESSIE <i>[ON RECORDING]: Right after,
uh, they beat up all three of them.</i>

19:34.591 --> 19:37.677
RIDGE: <i>Beat them up real bad? And
then they took their clothes off?</i>

19:37.844 --> 19:40.221
<i>JESSE". Mm..hmm. And then they--
FUDGE". Then they tied them?</i>

19:40.430 --> 19:43.183
<i>JESSE'. Then they tied them up.
Tied their hands up.</i>

19:43.391 --> 19:47.979
RIDGE: <i>And about what time was it
that all this was taking place?</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:50.064
<i>JESSE:
I was there about 12.</i>

19:50.273 --> 19:52.066
<i>RIDGE:
About noon?</i>

19:53.109 --> 19:57.739
<i>Okay. Was it after school had let out?
JESSE". I didn't go to school.</i>

19:57.906 --> 19:59.782
STIDHAM:
It couldn't have happened at noon.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.869
It couldn't have happened
before the kids were out of school.

20:03.077 --> 20:08.791
So they kept leading him down the path
from noon to 4:30, 5:30, 6:30.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.043
Was it getting dark?

20:10.251 --> 20:14.214
RIDGE: <i>Your time period might not be
exactly right, what you're saying.</i>

20:14.422 --> 20:17.175
STIDHAM: Police officers don't
like the word "interrogation."

20:17.383 --> 20:19.052
They like the word "interview."

20:19.260 --> 20:22.472
So Mr. Misskelley wasn't interviewed,
he was interrogated.

20:22.680 --> 20:27.352
And he was interrogated from 9:00
in the morning until after dark.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.313
This is an entire day
that he was being interrogated,

20:30.480 --> 20:32.815
yet we only had a few minutes
of the audio tape.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.694
<i>GITCHELL</i> [ON <i>RECORDING]:
Jessie, about what time was it</i>

20:36.861 --> 20:40.448
<i>when the boys
came up to the woods?</i>

20:40.657 --> 20:46.579
<i>JESSE'. I'd say it was about--
It was about 5 or so. Five or 6.</i>

20:46.746 --> 20:48.206
<i>GITCHELL:
Ummmm</i>

20:49.499 --> 20:54.087
<i>All right, you told me earlier it was
around 7 or 8 or... Which time is it?</i>

20:54.254 --> 20:55.797
JESSIE: <i>It's 7</i> or 8.
GITCHELL: Okay.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.799
<i>JESSIE:
I remember it was starting to get dark.</i>

20:57.966 --> 21:00.593
<i>GYYCHELL".
Okay, well, that clears it up.</i>

21:00.802 --> 21:04.597
DRIZIN: We all have our breaking points. I
think it's important that people realize

21:04.764 --> 21:08.726
that this is not just about a person

21:08.893 --> 21:12.230
with disabilities
falsely confessing to a crime.

21:12.397 --> 21:15.525
This is about police misconduct.
That's what this is about.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.653
Once police convince
the person to make a statement

21:18.820 --> 21:22.156
against their interest, how does
that person know what to say?

21:22.657 --> 21:27.245
<i>GITCHELL: Did anyone use</i> a
<i>stick, and hit the boys with?</i>

21:27.453 --> 21:32.792
<i>JESSIE: Damien had</i> a <i>kind of</i> a <i>big old
stick when he hit that first one.</i>

21:33.001 --> 21:35.670
It's because of this phenomenon
known as contamination,

21:35.878 --> 21:39.507
the police will suggest facts
about how the crime happened.

21:39.674 --> 21:43.136
RIDGE: <i>What was to keep these
little boys from running off?</i>

21:43.344 --> 21:47.640
<i>Were their hands tied in a fashion to where
they couldn't have run? You tell me.</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:49.934
NIRIDER: They're sitting there
listening to the police.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.937
Listening to their interrogators
ask those leading questions.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.233
"Weren't these boys sexually assaulted?"
Then they know what story to tell back.

21:57.442 --> 22:01.904
<i>RIDGE: Another boy was cut, I understand.
Where was he cut at?</i>

22:02.113 --> 22:04.407
<i>JESSE". At the bottom?
FUDGE'. On his bottom?</i>

22:04.615 --> 22:07.118
<i>GYYCHELL". Do you mean right here?
In his groin area?</i>

22:07.327 --> 22:08.745
<i>FUDGE".
Do you know what his penis is?</i>

22:08.911 --> 22:10.580
<i>JESSE:
Yeah, that's where he was cut at.</i>

22:10.747 --> 22:14.000
Did it ever occur to you
that what he was telling you was false?

22:14.167 --> 22:19.088
His entire story was false?
Jessie simply got confused. That's all.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.967
DRIZIN: I mean, Jessie was not convicted
on the basis of his confession.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.719
And neither was Damien and Jason.

22:24.927 --> 22:29.307
They were convicted on the basis
of Gary Gitchell's confession.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.352
That was his story.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.438
All they had to do
was get Jessie to agree to it.

22:35.646 --> 22:40.109
STIDHAM: It's not particularly difficult
to get a confession from someone

22:40.318 --> 22:41.819
who's mentally handicapped.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.948
It's like interviewing a 3- or 4-,
5-year-old child.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.953
BURNETT: People don't tend to confess
to crimes that they didn't commit.

22:51.162 --> 22:54.916
You know, I'm sure
there may be circumstances

22:55.083 --> 22:57.502
where a person might
have a low mentality.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.922
He's slow-minded, is what it is,
you know what I mean?

23:01.130 --> 23:05.343
It took a while for him to, you know,
get things straight in his mind.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.679
Kind of slow-minded, you know.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.891
Well, hell, everybody's a little bit
slow-minded anyway.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.520
I just have better faith
in our law enforcement

23:15.728 --> 23:19.690
than to force somebody
to make a statement that's untrue.

23:20.525 --> 23:24.445
HILL: I think that it was essentially
poisoned from the very beginning.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.323
The most basic things
about the investigations,

23:27.532 --> 23:29.117
talking to the family members.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.662
Getting statements from police
that evening.

23:32.870 --> 23:36.707
You know, whether they had these alibis
or not, but it wasn't done.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.627
And it's why the case went bad.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.964
<i>GAIL [ON RECORDING]: Y'all need to be
investigating some of these people</i>

23:43.131 --> 23:45.508
<i>who've been arrested
for child molestation.</i>

23:45.675 --> 23:46.968
<i>FUDGE".
Well, it's like this.</i>

23:47.176 --> 23:50.555
<i>We've got a story
that is very, very believable.</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:54.976
<i>It is so close to perfect
that we have to believe it.</i>

23:55.184 --> 23:57.395
<i>GAâ€œ;
I don't see how anyone could believe it.</i>

23:57.603 --> 24:00.940
<i>Jessie Misskelley said it happened
that morning and everything.</i>

24:01.149 --> 24:02.400
<i>Jason was in school.</i>

24:02.608 --> 24:04.485
<i>And then Jason mowed
his uncle's yard.</i>

24:04.694 --> 24:07.738
<i>He got some money,
went to play video games.</i>

24:07.905 --> 24:11.242
I called Jason's house,
and Jason and Damien

24:11.409 --> 24:13.828
and Jason's brother
were playing video games.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.747
They weren't talking much.
I got a little irritated at them.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.000
Damien asked me to call him
later that night.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.502
There was never a night
that we never spoke.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.713
I remember that we had talked
that night.

24:23.921 --> 24:27.425
When I spoke to police and they came
one afternoon and they spoke to me,

24:27.633 --> 24:29.677
and I talked to them once
and that was it.

24:29.886 --> 24:33.514
"On 9-10-1993, I met Jennifer Bearden
at her residence in Bartlett, Tennessee.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.434
The interview was a result
of having obtained information

24:36.601 --> 24:39.896
that she'd been on the phone
with Damien on the day of the homicide.

24:40.062 --> 24:44.775
She informed me of several times when she'd been
on the phone with Damien and Jason after school.

24:44.942 --> 24:49.280
And until about 9:30 p.m.
on the evening of 5-5-'93."

24:49.489 --> 24:52.366
I was never given a chance
to at least give them, you know,

24:52.575 --> 24:54.619
an alibi to the jury, I mean.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.705
And honestly, I don't think
it would have changed their minds.

24:57.914 --> 25:01.292
I think they were pretty dead-set
on what they were gonna decide.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.835
STIDHAM:
The evidence will show

25:03.002 --> 25:05.922
that not only was Mr. Misskelley
not in Robin Hood Hills

25:06.088 --> 25:11.052
at the time of these homicides, he was in
a different county almost 40 miles away

25:11.260 --> 25:13.429
the time these crimes occurred.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.349
There were a lot of alibi witnesses.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.935
When was the first time
you remember seeing Jessie?

25:19.143 --> 25:20.811
At, uh, 2:00.

25:20.978 --> 25:26.067
Jessie came to the house. I asked if he could
watch the kids while I went to a conference.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.236
She got back about 4:00
and we went walking.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.155
BOY: I seen him walking down the street.
I met him on the corner.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.617
Talking about him fixing to leave
to go to wrestling.

25:34.825 --> 25:38.287
STIDHAM: A lot of these folks, when
we went back and visited with them,

25:38.496 --> 25:41.415
they came to the conclusion,
"Oh, yeah, that's the night

25:41.582 --> 25:43.417
that we went wrestling with Jessie."

25:43.584 --> 25:46.712
Do you remember if you went wrestling?
Yes, sir, I did.

25:46.921 --> 25:50.132
Okay, do you remember who went?
Jessie, Freddy.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.885
Me and Jessie and Freddy

25:53.052 --> 25:55.680
and James was at wrestling
that night, you know.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.723
STIDHAM:
And that's the night that he got hurt.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.768
And that's the night
that so-and-so only went with us

26:00.977 --> 26:02.436
Once.
one time.

26:02.603 --> 26:06.399
That was the same night that we signed
this register at the wrestling hall.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.193
Do you remember seeing Misskelley?
Yes, sir.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.653
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.780
You remember Jessie Misskelley?
Yes, sir.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.865
Are you positive about that?
Yes, sir.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.452
Looking through the juror's notes,
they hardly seemed to pay attention

26:18.619 --> 26:20.454
during the alibi portion of it.

26:24.792 --> 26:30.298
PAM: You could say I sort of, like, died
myself because I shut out humanity,

26:30.506 --> 26:34.302
and I didn't like people,
I was a hateful person,

26:34.510 --> 26:37.722
and before this happened
I wasn't that type of person.

26:37.888 --> 26:42.893
Words can't explain what the grief,
and what you go through...

26:43.811 --> 26:48.107
We have found this to be
a world of its own.

26:48.316 --> 26:51.944
PAM: We had quite a few arguments and
stuff because I couldn't let go.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.864
He told me I had to let it go,
I had to keep living,

26:55.072 --> 26:59.327
and I told him I was still in that ditch
just as much as my son was,

26:59.535 --> 27:04.624
and I was clawing my way out of it
the best way that I knew how.

27:04.832 --> 27:11.297
I left Terry in 2002
and we were divorced in 2004.

27:12.173 --> 27:16.844
I do think that you can meet someone
and know that there's something there.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.846
That there's some journey there
for you.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.682
But I think it takes a long,
it does take a long time,

27:21.849 --> 27:24.310
and I think it's a painful process,
actually.

27:24.769 --> 27:30.316
I was talking about it and how really
and truly stressed out you were that day.

27:30.524 --> 27:34.487
It was the first time you'd been touched
by anybody, like, in seven years.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.698
And I'll never forget you were, like,
so completely pale.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.992
And you were shaking,
and I kind of thought

27:40.159 --> 27:42.995
you were gonna pass out
at one point.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.622
[DAMIEN LAUGHS OVER PHONE]

27:44.830 --> 27:48.668
It was a Buddhist ceremony,
and we kind of wrote it ourselves and--

27:48.876 --> 27:52.171
<i>DAMIEN: They had</i> a <i>little-- We had</i> a <i>little
temple set up or</i> a <i>little altar set up,</i>

27:52.380 --> 27:54.298
<i>We did.
Incense burning on it.</i>

27:54.465 --> 27:57.134
<i>You know, they had two guards
up there watching the whole thing.</i>

27:57.343 --> 28:00.513
<i>And you could tell they had no idea,
you know, what the hell was going on.</i>

28:00.721 --> 28:03.224
<i>So they just pretty much stayed
out of the way.</i>

28:03.432 --> 28:07.687
We'd intersperse lots of, you know,
bowing, then kissing and hugging.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.190
I think you're supposed to only kiss
once or something in the ceremony.

28:11.357 --> 28:15.361
We just-- We made it seem like
it was a part of the ceremony.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.530
So that was nice,
that was really nice.

28:17.738 --> 28:22.451
But, you know, back then
it was nothing like it is now, you know,

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
with the people who knew
about the case.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.624
So it was kind of nice
because it was real low-key.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.835
[Hr]

28:35.047 --> 28:40.177
RIORDAN: I had talked to Lorri. She
had come out to talk about the case.

28:40.344 --> 28:44.640
My attitude at the time was,
you know, we cannot do this.

28:44.849 --> 28:49.979
They were adamant that this should be
and was a case about innocence.

28:50.187 --> 28:55.234
"We don't want you to focus on death
versus life without parole.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.069
This is a case about innocence."

28:57.278 --> 28:59.905
My reaction was,
if it is a case about innocence,

29:00.114 --> 29:03.033
what they said is that
there's all of this investigation

29:03.200 --> 29:05.453
that has to be done on the ground
in Arkansas.

29:05.661 --> 29:09.749
And we're, you know, a two-lawyer
partnership in San Francisco.

29:09.957 --> 29:14.086
How are we possibly gonna get
the resources to get on the ground

29:14.295 --> 29:17.131
and really investigate
a case in Arkansas?

29:17.757 --> 29:22.720
Lorri Davis said,
<i>"I'll</i> find a way to do it."

29:22.928 --> 29:28.559
I've quit my job, my other job,
so I that can work full-time on the case.

29:28.768 --> 29:32.146
Attorneys for Damien Echols are
appealing their client's conviction

29:32.354 --> 29:35.191
on Arkansas Rule 37,
ineffective counsel.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.026
Prosecutors disagree.

29:37.234 --> 29:41.030
It was effective, it was thorough.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.032
It was a 17-day trial.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.411
REPORTER: Outside the court, supporters
unveiled a banner of more than 2500 postcards,

29:47.578 --> 29:50.539
each pleading to free
the West Memphis Three.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.793
VEDDER: It was always about
free the West Memphis Three.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.880
We were raising funds and it wasn't
even to raise money for their defense.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.841
It was to raise money
so they had money when they got out.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.552
Because the day was coming soon.

30:04.178 --> 30:06.722
ROLLINS: I decided it
should be Black Flag songs.

30:06.889 --> 30:10.851
I called Iggy Pop, he said sure.
I called Lemmy, he said, "I'm in."

30:11.018 --> 30:13.896
Called Chuck D from Public Enemy,
he said, "You got it."

30:14.063 --> 30:17.650
All to help these three guys
who I'd never met.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.861
I went to your benefit show in '03
for the West Memphis Three.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.322
It was like the best concert
I've ever been to.

30:23.531 --> 30:25.866
See?
I can't believe that this is still going on.

30:26.033 --> 30:30.412
Yeah, well. I saw a little bit of myself.
Damien liked to hang out alone

30:30.579 --> 30:33.290
and wrote in his journals
that he was depressed. Hello.

30:33.499 --> 30:37.127
He liked to listen to weird music.
Check.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.172
He was a wise-ass
in the face of law enforcement.

30:40.381 --> 30:44.301
I mean, are you kidding?
It could have been me.

30:44.969 --> 30:46.011
Could have been me.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.097
Not everyone agreed
with Rollins' message.

30:48.264 --> 30:53.227
The parents of the murdered children
showed displeasure with picket signs.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.896
My baby was murdered
and butchered like an animal

30:56.063 --> 30:57.565
and his two friends were too.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.860
Whatever punishment they get,
they deserve.

31:01.026 --> 31:05.781
REPORTER: Michael's mother, Diana Moore,
agrees, telling us, "Make no mistake about it.

31:05.948 --> 31:09.660
These three you see convicted
and sentenced did it."

31:09.869 --> 31:13.038
ROLLINS: I started getting very
passionate, very sincere hate mail.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.875
Because if you are seen to be
sticking up for someone

31:16.083 --> 31:19.712
who someone else truly believes
has murdered a child,

31:19.920 --> 31:23.132
there's no way you can reason
with that person.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.968
VEDDER: I remember thinking
that if we could get involved,

31:26.135 --> 31:28.721
we'd probably get them out
in maybe one or two years.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.681
That's how naive I was.

31:30.890 --> 31:35.686
It's usually on average
of like 15 to 20 years.

31:35.895 --> 31:38.731
If you would have told us that
three or four years in,

31:38.939 --> 31:41.275
I think it would have been
quite daunting.

31:42.818 --> 31:48.574
LORRI: This is the first e-mail that I received
from Fran and Peter, and it's 7-25-'05.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.702
"What a horror story, unbelievable.

31:51.869 --> 31:55.289
Something positive
has to come from this.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.750
What can we do down here
in New Zealand?

31:57.958 --> 32:00.544
Our names are Peter Jackson
and Fran Walsh.

32:00.753 --> 32:04.715
We would like to offer financial
assistance to help facilitate, hopefully,

32:04.924 --> 32:08.510
a positive outcome in Damien's appeal
to the federal court."

32:08.719 --> 32:10.721
JACKSON:
When Fran and I first got involved,

32:10.930 --> 32:13.766
it felt like the case
was in a holding pattern.

32:13.933 --> 32:18.312
But it wasn't a holding pattern
for Damien's chances of staying alive.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.814
That doesn't go into a holding pattern.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.609
LORRI: "Dear Fran and Peter,
your e-mail was a welcome sight

32:23.776 --> 32:27.488
on a very hot Monday morning
here in Arkansas.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.114
My name is Lorri Davis

32:29.323 --> 32:32.493
and I have been involved
in working on the case for nine years.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.245
There are many twists
and turns to the story.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.331
It's still incredibly frustrating.

32:37.539 --> 32:40.459
Appeal's taking forever
and funds always needed."

32:41.961 --> 32:47.967
JACKSON: I have a pathological hatred
of bullying and people in power

32:48.175 --> 32:52.471
crapping on people who have
no ability to defend themselves.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.933
I believe in justice. I think there are
good people and bad people.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.352
People do horrible things
and should be punished.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.188
Justice should be fair,
it should be honorable,

33:01.397 --> 33:05.275
it should be decent, it should speak
to our values as human beings

33:05.484 --> 33:07.444
that right must prevail.

33:08.779 --> 33:12.199
And all that I could see in the case
of the West Memphis Three is

33:12.408 --> 33:18.080
wrong was prevailing and that wrong
was being perpetrated by people

33:18.288 --> 33:21.000
who, I believe,
knew they were doing wrong.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.839
DAMIEN: Most people think that this
case is something extraordinary.

33:27.006 --> 33:30.801
It's spectacular in some sort of way,
and it's not. Burnett and Fogleman

33:30.968 --> 33:34.096
thought they could make a name
for themselves off of this case.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.849
Because, really,
you're dealing with three kids

33:37.057 --> 33:40.686
who were bottom of the barrel,
poor white trash

33:40.894 --> 33:44.023
that nobody's ever gonna
ask another question about.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.318
He thought they would say, "Guilty."

33:48.527 --> 33:51.030
This whole thing would be swept
under the rug.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.573
The state would kill me.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.159
Jason and Jessie would spend
their lives in prison.

33:55.325 --> 33:58.162
He'd move up the political ladder.
That's all he cared about.

33:58.328 --> 34:04.209
This case is nothing out of the ordinary.
This happens all the time.

34:07.171 --> 34:11.007
How did I decide
which trial would go first?

34:12.217 --> 34:15.679
And the reason I'm hesitating,
I'm trying to think if that's a question

34:15.888 --> 34:18.599
that I should be answering.

34:19.475 --> 34:22.226
In general, a case with a confession,

34:22.978 --> 34:25.813
uh, would be your easier case

34:25.981 --> 34:29.193
as opposed to one
without direct evidence.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.784
Ten feet, ma'am. Back up.
REPORTER 1: Okay.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.953
Are you gonna testify
against your co-defendants?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.915
REPORTER 2: Jessie, were you
forced to talk about this?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.750
LEVERITT:
The prosecutors had a problem.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.668
They could not play the tape

34:46.877 --> 34:49.254
of Misskelley's statement
at the second trial.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.340
STIDHAM:
They needed Mr. Misskelley to testify.

34:51.507 --> 34:54.551
They thought they were gonna lose
the other two.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.719
REPORTER:
Are you worried about his testimony?

34:56.887 --> 35:01.016
STIDHAM: Judge Burnett appointed Phillip
Wells to interview Mr. Misskelley

35:01.225 --> 35:04.436
to make sure he didn't really,
really, really want to testify

35:04.645 --> 35:07.356
against Baldwin and Echols.

35:07.523 --> 35:10.400
Here's a young 18-year-old,
under a lot of stress,

35:10.567 --> 35:15.364
facing life plus 40 years in penitentiary.
He has to make sure whatever options

35:15.531 --> 35:19.660
and offers are available to him
are looked into or communicated.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.580
NIRIDER: Promises of lesser sentences,
you know, a much easier life in prison.

35:23.789 --> 35:28.043
DRIZIN: Many defendants would have
jumped on that deal. Jessie said no.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.170
NIRIDER: They can't come
up with physical evidence.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.090
They've got to turn to witnesses
who they can convince

35:33.257 --> 35:36.718
to give statements in court. That's
the only evidence they come up with.

35:36.927 --> 35:41.056
REPORTER: Just when it seemed attorneys for
the state had their back against a wall,

35:41.265 --> 35:44.059
Craighead County Courthouse
came to an eerie silence

35:44.268 --> 35:47.563
as 16-year-old Michael Carson,
a formerjuvenile inmate,

35:47.771 --> 35:50.107
who spent time with Baldwin,
took the stand.

35:50.315 --> 35:55.154
CARSON: I was doing serious adult drugs
and, I mean, I was doing a lot of them.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.907
I got out there.
I thought birds had cameras on them.

36:00.117 --> 36:05.455
Michael Carson, he was fixing
to go to the penitentiary

36:05.664 --> 36:11.086
for several counts
of residential burglary,

36:11.295 --> 36:15.591
and that is when the prosecutor
got a hold of him.

36:15.799 --> 36:19.303
Were you offered anything
as far as a reward

36:19.469 --> 36:21.221
or anything of that nature?

36:21.388 --> 36:22.931
No, sir, and if I was,
I would deny it.

36:23.098 --> 36:27.269
Jason was not very outspoken. He wasn't,
you know, jumping around and stuff.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.230
He's a very quiet,
to-himself type of person.

36:30.439 --> 36:33.275
What did he tell you?
He told me

36:33.483 --> 36:35.319
how he dismembered the kid,

36:35.527 --> 36:37.946
he sucked the blood
from the penis and scrotum

36:38.155 --> 36:40.365
and put the balls in his mouth.

36:40.574 --> 36:43.327
I remember not knowing
why I was doing what I was doing.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.913
I remember it actually going
through my head.

36:46.121 --> 36:51.376
I would have this massive illusion
in my head and swear to God it was real.

36:51.585 --> 36:55.464
CURTON: And the kids, that night
I let them listen to the news,

36:55.672 --> 36:58.800
and they just went crazy.

36:59.009 --> 37:04.473
They said, "He's a lying son of a bitch.
Jason didn't tell him nothing."

37:05.307 --> 37:08.143
CARSON: I could understand why he
would never want to see me again

37:08.352 --> 37:13.232
or talk to me again, but I'm just
telling him right now that I'm sorry.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.361
CURETON: I made the statement
to Larry, the sheriff.

37:17.527 --> 37:20.364
I said,
"Larry, those kids are not guilty."

37:20.572 --> 37:24.952
He said, "Joyce."
He said, "it's this simple.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.915
Crittenden County fucked up,
now we've got to clean up."

37:30.123 --> 37:31.166
CARSON:
I'm a drug addict.

37:31.375 --> 37:35.796
I was doing a lot of inhalants, LSD,
I was huffing gas all the time.

37:36.004 --> 37:41.343
It's bad. It takes your whole perspective
on life and makes it a dream.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.890
And they knew that.
They knew the drugs that I was doing.

37:57.067 --> 38:00.028
LORRI: Did you walk in
those woods in the winter?

38:00.237 --> 38:03.490
DAMIEN [OVER <i>PHONE]: Yeah, that was
the best time because during summer</i>

38:03.699 --> 38:06.118
<i>it's really marshy.</i>

38:06.326 --> 38:09.579
<i>During the winter it was froze,
the ground would be froze solid.</i>

38:09.788 --> 38:13.583
<i>So you didn't have to worry about
all the mud and all that business.</i>

38:13.792 --> 38:16.545
LORRI:
I love the thought of being out there.

38:16.753 --> 38:21.550
DAMIEN: The cool, dark part of the year,
it's my absolute favorite time of year.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.677
Part of it was that whenever I was out,

38:23.844 --> 38:26.930
that was always the time of year
whenever I felt the safest.

38:27.139 --> 38:30.851
Because most people, whenever
it gets cold, you know, they're not out.

38:31.059 --> 38:35.856
So it's almost like at that time of year
the entire world is almost yours.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.149
Nobody else wants it.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.568
[Hr]

38:39.735 --> 38:43.238
Jason and I would talk about leaving
that place, moving out of that place,

38:43.447 --> 38:48.243
but we were so young that it never was
a definite plan, it was always just

38:48.452 --> 38:51.663
we've got to get the hell out of here.

38:51.872 --> 38:55.834
The thing that Jason always loved
was art. You know, painting,

38:56.043 --> 38:57.377
drawing, things like that.

38:57.586 --> 39:00.422
He would do these paintings
that were absolutely incredible

39:00.589 --> 39:02.424
when he had art class in school.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.468
The teacher would refuse
to grade them.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.512
She would say,
"That's not what I told you to paint.

39:07.721 --> 39:11.933
That's not what I told you to draw,
I don't want to see one more skull."

39:12.142 --> 39:16.146
She would say, you know, "You were
assigned to do a still-life of flowers."

39:16.313 --> 39:19.816
Jason was like, "Fuck that, I'm not
doing that, it's not what I want to do."

39:21.651 --> 39:25.655
I've jokingly said to Lorri before
that I think that, in a lot of ways,

39:25.822 --> 39:28.575
I may have brought this on myself,
this entire situation.

39:28.742 --> 39:31.328
Because when I was a child
I knew what my passion was,

39:31.536 --> 39:35.957
I knew what my drive was, I knew
what my desire was. I loved magic.

39:36.166 --> 39:39.378
I would say to myself, you know,
these names that people think of.

39:39.586 --> 39:42.422
I would say, "One day my name
is gonna eclipse all of them.

39:42.631 --> 39:45.175
I'm gonna be the greatest magician
there's ever been."

39:45.384 --> 39:49.262
And I had no idea that that meant
I would have 20 years

39:49.471 --> 39:53.725
to sit alone in a prison cell
and practice and study.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.813
But that's a word
that you don't even use here,

39:58.021 --> 40:00.190
because when people
hear the word "magic,"

40:00.357 --> 40:02.776
anything even remotely
connected to magic

40:02.984 --> 40:04.861
has to be evil in some kind of way.

40:07.114 --> 40:09.699
DRIVER:
Uh, I noticed that Damien,

40:09.908 --> 40:15.455
he had on kind of a black
duster-looking coat and carried a staff.

40:15.622 --> 40:18.750
And I-- You know,
that's kind of weird-looking.

40:18.959 --> 40:24.798
But that's one of the things
that I testified to in the court hearing.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.258
JACKSON
Damien, Jason

40:26.466 --> 40:29.719
and Jessie had no motive
whatsoever to kill these three boys.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.222
You know,
boys that they didn't even know.

40:32.973 --> 40:37.310
And so, therefore, the state went
to the only motiveless theory

40:37.477 --> 40:39.521
that they could possibly go to.

40:40.021 --> 40:42.357
We thought that the best thing
to do would be to

40:42.566 --> 40:45.569
actually get some expert analysis
on the crime itself.

40:45.777 --> 40:50.907
As far as we could see the best person
to get would be John Douglas,

40:51.491 --> 40:57.372
who was there at the creation
of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit.

40:59.166 --> 41:03.462
From the evidence and the crime scene,
they start to put a picture together

41:03.670 --> 41:07.340
of who committed the crime
and why they committed the crime.

41:07.549 --> 41:11.595
DOUGLAS: My role when I was brought into this
case was primarily to analyze the case to see

41:12.387 --> 41:15.515
does it really fit the three people
they have in prison?

41:15.724 --> 41:17.559
I didn't wanna know anything
about them.

41:17.726 --> 41:20.770
I don't want to become prejudiced
and be swayed in any way.

41:21.062 --> 41:26.026
If I do an analysis like this, you may not
like what I have to say. I'm not a hired gun.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.778
When I work on a case like this,
I work for the victims.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.907
No matter who brings me in,
I'm working for the victims.

41:33.241 --> 41:36.912
This appeared to be
what we call a lust murder.

41:37.120 --> 41:41.208
There's blunt-force trauma inflicted
on these children.

41:41.416 --> 41:45.337
There was evidence of sexual mutilation
to one of the victims.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.964
Three victims were hog-tied
with their shoelaces

41:48.173 --> 41:51.593
from their wrists to their ankles.

41:51.801 --> 41:56.515
And on the surface, it appeared
to be a sexually motivated crime.

41:57.432 --> 42:01.728
The focus of the investigation
is always on the families.

42:02.187 --> 42:05.357
You start from there,
and you work your way out.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.526
[Hr]

42:08.276 --> 42:10.195
STIDHAM:
There were some police notes

42:10.403 --> 42:13.031
where they had looked
into the possibility

42:13.198 --> 42:17.202
that a stepfather might be involved.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.705
BYERS: They take me back to
the police station and said:

42:20.872 --> 42:25.544
"We have information
that you are involved in this crime

42:25.710 --> 42:26.836
and that you did it."

42:27.045 --> 42:30.715
RIDGE <i>[ON RECORDING]: I may have
information that you have something to do</i>

42:30.882 --> 42:35.262
<i>with the disappearance of the boys,
and, ultimately, of the murder.</i>

42:35.428 --> 42:39.599
<i>BYERS". It's almost more than I can believe,
you know, what you just said to me.</i>

42:39.808 --> 42:43.144
<i>And it makes me so mad inside</i>

42:43.353 --> 42:46.898
<i>that I just kind of got to hold myself
here in this chair.</i>

42:47.107 --> 42:49.651
I had hair removed.

42:49.859 --> 42:55.115
I had to have over 30 pubic hairs
pulled out, plus the roots.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.450
<i>FUDGE". We're gonna interview
the other two fathers.</i>

42:57.659 --> 42:59.911
<i>We're gonna ask them
the same questions.</i>

43:00.120 --> 43:03.999
They said, "We're gonna do
the other family members

43:04.207 --> 43:06.293
just like we gonna do you."

43:07.919 --> 43:14.175
JACKSON: The assumption is that the crime was
unusual, it was bizarre, it was grotesque.

43:14.884 --> 43:18.054
Even when
<i>Paradise Lost 2</i> comes <i>out,</i>

43:18.263 --> 43:20.682
and they are presenting
an alternative scenario,

43:20.890 --> 43:27.147
they're going to an equally theatrical
possible perpetrator in John Mark Byers.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.317
LORRI:
"Dearest Damien.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.611
There are many things we can do

43:32.777 --> 43:35.905
that can shed light on the truth
of what happened to those boys.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.533
It is impossible
to do something this heinous

43:38.742 --> 43:40.577
and not leave a personal imprint.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.622
We need to do extensive
investigative work on Byers,

43:43.830 --> 43:46.791
investigative work
that the police failed to do."

43:47.959 --> 43:51.254
DOUGLAS: I went down to the
Memphis area and conducted

43:51.463 --> 43:55.175
an interview with Mark Byers, or
attempted to conduct an initial interview.

43:55.383 --> 43:59.929
I knocked on his door,
he came out, his wife came out,

44:00.138 --> 44:02.641
and pretty much,
he wanted to kick me off his porch.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.100
He didn't wanna talk to me.

44:04.309 --> 44:10.940
BYERS: It was daily grind, fighting on the
Internet with people, being in a place

44:11.149 --> 44:15.987
and someone recognizing me
and get up and go call their friends,

44:16.196 --> 44:21.368
then all of a sudden, I got a mob,
and I got to sneak out the back door

44:21.576 --> 44:23.536
because I know
a ass-kicking's coming.

44:23.745 --> 44:27.957
LORRI: "We need to find all of Mark Byers'
living relatives. We need to find Ryan Clark.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.877
We need to figure out a strategy
for getting him to talk.

44:31.086 --> 44:32.921
We need to know where
and at what time

44:33.088 --> 44:35.340
they went looking for Christopher
on May 5th.

44:35.507 --> 44:37.467
We need to locate all
of Byers' vehicles

44:37.676 --> 44:40.512
that he owned at that time
and Luminol-test them.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.597
We need to access
Byers' ex-residence

44:42.806 --> 44:45.892
and Luminol-test every floor surface
in the house.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.978
Lots of questions,
and not many answers.

44:49.604 --> 44:52.232
But right now
we're still stumbling around in the dark

44:52.399 --> 44:53.858
looking for a light switch."

44:57.195 --> 44:59.072
DOUGLAS:
Mark Byers, he had a tough life.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.826
He has a criminal history,
got busted for some prescription drugs.

45:03.660 --> 45:08.581
But he is not the type of personality
that would perpetrate a crime

45:08.790 --> 45:12.711
like the crimes I was looking at
here in West Memphis.

45:12.919 --> 45:14.879
RIORDAN:
When we learned the case,

45:15.088 --> 45:18.007
the timeline just
didn't add up to us.

45:18.216 --> 45:21.886
JACKSON: Beyond the theatrical
nature of Mark Byers,

45:22.095 --> 45:25.265
he didn't have a motive,
he didn't actually have the opportunity.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.434
RIORDAN:
It became clear to us that,

45:27.642 --> 45:29.728
you know,
people were looking at Byers

45:29.936 --> 45:33.106
because they thought he was
the sort of person who could do this.

45:33.314 --> 45:36.735
And our reaction to that was
the reason Damien got convicted

45:36.901 --> 45:40.196
was that people thought he was
the sort of person who could do this.

45:41.740 --> 45:43.074
DOUGLAS:
When I was in the Bureau,

45:43.241 --> 45:46.119
we came up with a crime
classification manual we designed.

45:46.286 --> 45:47.495
We considered Satanic

45:47.662 --> 45:50.832
because these cops were
bringing back these cases to us.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.584
Satanic murders, Satanic murders.

45:52.792 --> 45:55.295
There were classes being offered
all over the country.

45:55.503 --> 45:57.005
Oprah Winfrey had shows,

45:57.213 --> 46:00.049
Geraldo Rivera had shows,
it was all over here.

46:00.258 --> 46:04.471
Another area that you might
find Satanic ritual carving

46:04.637 --> 46:06.389
is in the stomach area.

46:06.598 --> 46:09.601
This is not a Satanic--
This is not a ritual. It's a murder.

46:09.809 --> 46:11.895
It's a murder
maybe by one crazy guy.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.230
If you're calling this Satanic,
we could have

46:14.397 --> 46:16.775
just as many murders
where a Bible is left there.

46:16.941 --> 46:20.361
Does that make it a Christian murder?
It's a Bible? I mean, no, it's nuts.

46:20.570 --> 46:23.531
It's just one, you know, crazy person.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.492
Police say Satanists in our area

46:25.658 --> 46:29.329
often conduct their rituals
in remote, wooded areas.

46:29.537 --> 46:34.042
FOGLEMAN: At some point did Damien
invite you to some meeting?

46:34.209 --> 46:35.251
He did.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.879
STIDHAM: The West Memphis
Police didn't seem interested

46:38.046 --> 46:41.257
in corroborating anything,
they just took everything at face value.

46:41.883 --> 46:46.221
A cult, Satanic meeting.
FOGLEMAN: Okay.

46:49.766 --> 46:52.977
I got a phone call from
a lawyer in Fayetteville

46:53.144 --> 46:55.772
who had Vicki Hutcheson
sitting at her desk.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.066
WOMAN:
Would you raise your right hand?

46:58.233 --> 47:02.445
STIDHAM: Said, "She's ready to recant her
trial testimony, how fast can you get here?"

47:03.863 --> 47:07.784
She obviously asked for immunity
from the state,

47:07.951 --> 47:09.619
which they refused to grant.

47:09.828 --> 47:15.166
So here's the State of Arkansas at
the Rule 37 hearings still stonewalling,

47:15.375 --> 47:18.545
still refusing to let the truth shine
on this case.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.755
<i>HUTCHESON [ON RECORDING]:
Damien and I stood back,</i>

47:20.922 --> 47:23.550
<i>and then these kids took
their clothes off,</i>

47:23.758 --> 47:27.929
<i>and I looked at Damien,
and I said, "I want to leave."</i>

47:28.638 --> 47:33.643
I testified to it, but I lied on the stand.

47:33.852 --> 47:36.271
STIDHAM: It was frightening to
listen to her tell the truth,

47:36.479 --> 47:38.898
the truth that I knew had existed
all these years.

47:39.107 --> 47:42.110
The truth that she wouldn't
come out and say

47:42.277 --> 47:44.904
because she was afraid
of what would happen to her.

47:45.071 --> 47:47.031
WOMAN: You mentioned
that you went and met

47:47.198 --> 47:49.367
Jerry Driver
at the Marion Police Department.

47:49.576 --> 47:51.077
DRIVER:
I'm trying to remember.

47:51.286 --> 47:52.787
I do, I know who she is.

47:52.996 --> 47:56.040
It's just kind of back in my mind
somewhere.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.084
WOMAN:
What did they ask you to do?

47:58.293 --> 48:01.880
Do I think-- They asked me,
do I think I could get, um, Jessie

48:02.088 --> 48:03.548
to introduce me to Damien.

48:04.173 --> 48:10.722
DRIVER: All we asked her was to go
in and see what she could find out.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.560
Now that was with police department's
knowledge and consent.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.437
He's the one that suggested:

48:17.645 --> 48:21.274
"Well, if you're gonna have Damien over,
you to need to have demon books

48:21.482 --> 48:24.652
on your coffee table."

48:24.861 --> 48:28.406
The only thing she was coached
to do was to not get caught,

48:28.615 --> 48:33.745
because we were actually afraid
that if she got caught, he'd kill her.

48:34.495 --> 48:37.498
HUTCHESON: Damien looks down
at those demon book things.

48:37.707 --> 48:41.002
And I said, "Why are you so nervous?"
And he said, "Well, you'd be nervous too

48:41.169 --> 48:43.421
if they thought you killed
three little kids."

48:43.588 --> 48:45.715
And I said, "Why would they think you,
of all people?"

48:45.882 --> 48:49.093
And he goes, "I'm-- Because I'm weird,
I guess, you know." And I was like--

48:49.260 --> 48:51.054
I Was like, "Well, did you kill them?"

48:51.220 --> 48:54.849
He said, "Well, no! I wouldn't do
something like that," like I was stupid.

48:55.016 --> 48:58.394
And he was just like any other kid
his age, you know.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.355
He was just a normal kid.

49:00.521 --> 49:01.940
WOMAN:
Any other contact with Damien?

49:02.148 --> 49:03.441
None at all.
Okay.

49:03.650 --> 49:09.822
I was just a big liar,
and I really was just a big liar.

49:10.531 --> 49:13.952
STIDHAM: I've spent a lot of
the last 17 years looking back

49:14.160 --> 49:17.538
at what I should have done
and what I could have done.

49:17.872 --> 49:21.918
You know, it would be easy for me
to say I did the best I could.

49:22.126 --> 49:25.672
But I didn't.
There's no substitute for experience,

49:25.880 --> 49:29.759
and it's hard to look back.

49:34.347 --> 49:36.432
[Hr]

49:36.599 --> 49:40.228
JONES: It was before the trial when
Mr. Fogleman was leaving my office,

49:40.436 --> 49:45.483
I stopped him in the hallway,
and I asked him, "Is this actually Satanic?

49:45.650 --> 49:48.027
Is that what they're saying?"

49:48.861 --> 49:52.907
And he-- His response was no,
it's not Satanic.

49:53.116 --> 49:56.285
It's just murder.

49:57.453 --> 50:00.915
It's not something made up,
it's not something dreamed up,

50:01.124 --> 50:03.668
it's not a figment
of our imagination.

50:03.876 --> 50:08.881
The evidence was that this murder
had the trappings of an occult murder,

50:09.090 --> 50:10.800
a Satanic murder.

50:11.009 --> 50:16.639
When you take the crime scene,
the injuries to these kids,

50:16.848 --> 50:21.728
the testimony about sucking of blood,
and there's a transference of power

50:21.936 --> 50:24.313
from drinking of blood.

50:25.148 --> 50:28.276
Could you have any reason
to understand

50:28.484 --> 50:33.781
why someone would do that
to three 8-year-old boys?

50:33.990 --> 50:40.329
Well, you know, everyone can say,
"Well, who did you tell?" Well, nobody.

50:40.538 --> 50:46.002
I think this case was never about justice
because they knew we didn't do this.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.546
Fogleman knew we did not do this.

50:49.088 --> 50:53.342
FOGLEMAN: Is it a coincidence
this knife is found in the lake,

50:53.509 --> 50:57.972
hidden behind
Jason Baldwin's house?

50:58.473 --> 51:01.768
And the same person that this knife
is found behind is the person

51:01.976 --> 51:04.437
that told Michael Carson
that he did it,

51:04.645 --> 51:08.274
and he sucked the blood out
of the kid's penis, is that a coincidence?

51:08.483 --> 51:11.694
RIORDAN: If you ask me, the
single greatest offense

51:11.903 --> 51:16.699
committed in this case
is what was done by John Fogleman

51:16.908 --> 51:18.493
with the knife in the lake.

51:18.701 --> 51:22.080
LEVERITT: Fogleman had divers search
a small lake behind the trailer park

51:22.288 --> 51:26.125
where Baldwin lived.
That search produced a knife.

51:27.085 --> 51:31.422
DOUGLAS: To go out there in this
big pond, and to go right there,

51:31.631 --> 51:35.802
and in just less than 3O minutes
and come up with this-- This knife.

51:36.010 --> 51:39.222
I mean, you win the lottery.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.891
And then there's a reporter covering it.

51:42.100 --> 51:46.938
RIORDAN: We interviewed and have
the declaration of the diver.

51:47.146 --> 51:51.859
He said that he was given
a description of the knife

51:52.068 --> 51:55.029
and where it would be located.

51:55.238 --> 51:58.866
The press said they were told--
And we have the reporter.

51:59.075 --> 52:02.078
"Come to the lake,
we are about to make a discovery."

52:04.413 --> 52:08.209
The prosecution knew the knife
was in the lake.

52:08.417 --> 52:11.462
Nothing wrong with that.
You have an informant, they tell you:

52:11.671 --> 52:15.383
"Oh, the crime was committed and
we know where the murder weapon is.

52:15.591 --> 52:18.302
They committed the crime
and they threw it in the lake."

52:18.511 --> 52:22.014
The thing is that informant
is of critical importance.

52:22.223 --> 52:24.684
They're the one
who connects it to the crime.

52:24.892 --> 52:28.437
They're the one who allows you
to say it was the murder weapon.

52:28.646 --> 52:32.275
Why don't you call
that informant at trial?

52:32.483 --> 52:36.571
Why instead do you tell a lie,
as John Fogleman did,

52:36.779 --> 52:41.075
and say, "I just had a hunch
it was in the lake"?

52:41.909 --> 52:46.706
The reason is that John Fogleman
had been told how it got in the lake.

52:46.914 --> 52:49.250
It was thrown in the lake
by Jason's mother.

52:49.458 --> 52:53.713
All I know is my son is innocent,
and he has been quiet.

52:53.921 --> 52:57.383
RIORDAN: And so there's a connection to Jason.
Why not bring it forward?

52:57.592 --> 53:00.636
Because the same people
who told them that it was in the lake

53:00.845 --> 53:05.266
let him know that it was thrown
into the lake a year before the crime.

53:06.684 --> 53:10.062
He knew that knife in the lake
had nothing to do with the crime

53:10.229 --> 53:13.191
because he had been told
when it was thrown in the lake.

53:13.399 --> 53:20.239
This knife, state's exhibit 77,
caused those injuries right there.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.118
Dash, dash, dash.

53:25.286 --> 53:27.955
FRENCH: I think the knife that
was in the courtroom was the one

53:28.164 --> 53:32.293
that was used on the Byers boy.

53:34.170 --> 53:36.172
I still think that.

53:36.380 --> 53:40.551
People that found the bodies
and saw the wounds

53:40.760 --> 53:43.429
said that it appeared
to be cult-related.

53:43.596 --> 53:48.059
Serrations are consistent with
being inflicted with this type of knife.

53:48.226 --> 53:51.771
The only way you can tell
if a serrated knife has been used

53:51.979 --> 53:55.441
is by looking for the serrations
that rub across the skin.

53:56.442 --> 53:59.362
STIDHAM: Arkansas is one of
the last remaining states

53:59.570 --> 54:02.573
that has a prosecutor-controlled
crime lab.

54:02.782 --> 54:06.869
What that means is
the medical examiner is not a witness

54:07.078 --> 54:11.540
for what actually happened, but he is
an actual arm of the prosecution.

54:11.749 --> 54:14.126
BRENT:
At this time I would ask that Dr. Peretti

54:14.335 --> 54:16.712
be allowed to show
the photographs and use...

54:16.921 --> 54:21.801
One of the key elements of the case that
we wanted to get into was Frank Peretti.

54:22.009 --> 54:25.846
Dr. Frank Peretti was the assistant
medical examiner at the time

54:26.055 --> 54:27.807
the autopsies were conducted.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.892
He's not actually board-certified.

54:30.101 --> 54:33.354
You get five chances to take
the board exams in Arkansas

54:33.562 --> 54:36.023
and Frank Peretti has
failed them twice.

54:36.190 --> 54:40.695
He's opted out of taking them again
for personal reasons.

54:41.529 --> 54:47.410
His medical testimony at the trial
created a picture in the jury's mind

54:47.618 --> 54:51.539
of a ritualistic, sexual murder.

54:51.747 --> 54:56.419
These type of injuries we commonly see
in the female rape victim.

54:56.627 --> 54:59.297
Trying to spread the legs
for penetration.

54:59.505 --> 55:04.885
The anal orifice was dilated, it could be
from putting an object in the anus.

55:05.094 --> 55:08.222
Those types of injuries
we generally see in children

55:08.389 --> 55:10.933
who are forced to perform oral sex.

55:11.142 --> 55:14.520
There's evidence of genital mutilation.
This is the cutting wound here

55:14.729 --> 55:16.772
and the red is the shaft of the penis.

55:16.981 --> 55:21.027
Cutting wounds, superficial cuts,
gouging-type injuries.

55:21.235 --> 55:23.904
Multiple superficial, interrupted cuts,
multiple cuts.

55:24.113 --> 55:25.573
Stab wounds and cutting wounds.

55:25.740 --> 55:29.118
The knife is being twisted
and the victim is moving.

55:29.327 --> 55:31.454
Gouging where the skin
has been pulled out.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.957
Gouging wounds, cutting wounds,
stab wounds.

55:35.166 --> 55:39.045
Skin is going to tear,
skin has just been pulled away, torn out.

55:39.253 --> 55:40.338
[Hr]

55:40.504 --> 55:46.260
STIDHAM: Those were the most horrifying
photographs that anyone could imagine.

55:46.469 --> 55:48.971
Those jurors were scared to death.

55:49.180 --> 55:55.227
He is painting the picture in jury's minds
of an absolutely horrific murder.

55:55.436 --> 55:56.562
Cruel and unusual.

55:57.605 --> 56:00.775
It's what the jury hears coming out
of Frank Peretti's mouth

56:00.983 --> 56:05.863
more than anything that sentences
Damien Echols to death.

56:06.030 --> 56:07.865
We took our lead from Peretti himself,

56:08.032 --> 56:11.869
because during the trial he holds up
this textbook on forensic pathology.

56:12.078 --> 56:16.290
And it's written by Vincent DiMaio, who
is a renowned medical examiner in Texas.

56:16.499 --> 56:21.003
BRENT: I believe you indicated that
Dr. DiMaio and you are on a first-name basis.

56:21.212 --> 56:22.463
Yes, I did.

56:22.671 --> 56:25.800
JACKSON:
And so we went to DiMaio himself.

56:28.511 --> 56:34.975
DIMAIO: The thing that's most interesting
in this case is that while the autopsies

56:35.184 --> 56:38.604
are done in exquisite detail,

56:38.813 --> 56:45.778
to me, the interpretation of the findings
are completely wrong.

56:46.821 --> 56:52.493
There is nothing here
that I would say was due to a knife.

56:52.660 --> 56:57.957
Either the cutting edge,
the tip or the back of a knife.

56:58.124 --> 57:01.794
If you think about how stupid it is,
they're saying they're killing these kids.

57:02.002 --> 57:07.383
And, you know, dragging the back
of a knife across them.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.177
When I looked at the photographs,

57:10.386 --> 57:13.931
it's obvious that by the appearance
of the wounds,

57:14.140 --> 57:16.142
they had occurred after death.

57:17.143 --> 57:22.523
If you're gonna torture and mutilate
someone, that's to cause pain to them.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.568
But these wounds are postmortem,

57:25.776 --> 57:30.156
so why are you torturing
and mutilating dead bodies?

57:30.364 --> 57:31.991
It doesn't make sense.

57:32.199 --> 57:35.619
The irregular nature of the wounds,
some scratches.

57:35.828 --> 57:39.582
There's no bleeding, there's no pattern.

57:39.790 --> 57:43.335
To me, it's obvious animal activity.

57:44.962 --> 57:49.008
GARNER: We actually called the place
back there we used to ride our bikes

57:49.216 --> 57:53.804
Turtle City. That's just behind there,
because there were so many turtles.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.598
Everywhere, hundreds of them.

57:55.806 --> 57:59.643
Painted turtles, snapping turtles,
soft-shell turtles, all kinds of turtles.

57:59.852 --> 58:04.440
SEALS: And they actually got such thing
called the alligator snapping turtle

58:04.607 --> 58:07.109
that could be found. I mean...

58:07.276 --> 58:10.237
Big turtles with humps in their back.

58:10.404 --> 58:12.823
That make them look
kind of like alligators.

58:13.032 --> 58:16.494
JAMIE: Our house was up against
a ditch, so we would go back.

58:16.660 --> 58:20.206
There was a lot of them there,
turtles, fish and mud.

58:20.372 --> 58:23.667
You'd see an armadillo that fell
in the water or got hit by a car,

58:23.876 --> 58:27.338
and there'd be like four or five turtles
just chewing on it.

58:27.546 --> 58:33.052
RICHARDS: Red flags should go up when
a body is pulled from the water.

58:34.845 --> 58:37.640
Especially in the month of May.

58:37.848 --> 58:40.142
At that latitude,
those reptiles are in high gear.

58:40.351 --> 58:45.105
They're feeding at their highest level,
their most voracious appetites.

58:52.613 --> 58:54.406
Just keep going, keep going.

58:57.576 --> 59:00.829
This is the bite mark I'm looking for.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.040
[Hr]

59:05.543 --> 59:08.712
You can already start to see
the outline of the jaw.

59:17.555 --> 59:20.975
DIMAIO: The animals usually
start with soft tissue.

59:23.143 --> 59:27.773
And the scrotum and the skin around
the penis is soft and they're coming off,

59:27.982 --> 59:32.653
so the animal doesn't have to
go against the body mass itself,

59:32.861 --> 59:35.698
but goes at the things
that are dangled in front of it.

59:40.494 --> 59:46.875
And then they'll go to things like lips
and the tip of the nose and the ears.

59:52.673 --> 59:57.011
What you're dealing with
is a horrendous crime.

59:57.219 --> 01:00:02.182
Three young boys
murdered in cold blood.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:05.185
Just that alone upsets people.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:10.858
You look at the bodies and there's
these savage injuries all over.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:18.032
It affects people emotionally
and it warps their judgment.

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:25.080
And then someone says,
"Maybe it's Satanic!"

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:29.835
And they say, "Well, the only type
of person who would do this

01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:33.255
would be someone like that."

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.549
JACKSON:
We didn't want just one opinion.

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.302
We thought the best thing to do
was basically to get

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:42.389
six or seven of the very best people,
get a wide range of views.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:46.685
Every single one of the independent
experts that we approached

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:49.647
came out with the same findings.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:53.192
BADEN: There's no evidence that these
injuries occurred while they were alive.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.988
There's no evidence that,
as the medical examiner testified,

01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:03.285
they were sexually assaulted,
pulled up by the ears, fellatio involved.

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:06.789
The problem is bad science
drives out good science.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.626
You don't have to be a rocket scientist
or a forensic dentist

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:14.588
to look at that serrations on the back
of that knife and say

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:17.925
that that knife made these marks.
I mean, give me a break.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:21.970
That is the most ridiculous statement
that I've ever heard.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:25.432
And to sell that to a jury
is unconscionable.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:30.729
JACKSON: We flew several of these
forensic pathologists down to Arkansas

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:33.607
to meet with Dr. Peretti face-to-face.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:37.319
Dr. Peretti listened patiently
and nodded his head.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.321
And said he would consider all this.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:42.658
But he'd concluded that this couldn't
have been caused by a turtle,

01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:44.910
and that's kind of where
he drew his line.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:47.079
Now here all this
information comes in.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.915
I start seeing a totally
different kind of situation.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.917
This is not a lust murder

01:01:52.126 --> 01:01:56.046
where the killer is going after
the genital areas of the victim.

01:01:56.255 --> 01:02:00.718
This is what's starting to develop to me
as a personal-cause homicide

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:05.305
directed at these children, but maybe
one more than-- More than others.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.934
In all probability this person
would have been interviewed.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:12.229
Should have been by now,
because he would be the logical person.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:15.065
There's a connection with the victims.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.532
DAMIEN: The person who killed those three kids
is still out there walking on the street.

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:27.661
To me, that would seem like
the highest priority. Not this case.

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.039
Not me, Jason or Jessie.
You know, don't get me wrong,

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.751
we're thankful for the support
that people give us.

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:37.004
But the main thing
I would be thinking about

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:42.217
is there's someone who killed three kids
still living in my neighborhood.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:44.678
[Hr]

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:47.598
JACKSON: If you disregard the
state's Satanic ritual theory,

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:51.268
the entire nature
of the crime changes.

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:56.982
It starts you thinking, "Well, maybe we're
not looking for these extreme suspects.

01:02:57.191 --> 01:03:02.237
We're looking for someone
who's kind of ordinary, invisible."

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:08.243
So at that point we thought we should
put more funding into the DNA testing.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.747
HORGAN: We're getting packages and
shipments of all sorts of DNA samples

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.667
that we're then forwarding
on to our DNA expert.

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:18.504
RIORDAN: Out there was a
process that was going on

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:22.257
that either would be the impetus
for exoneration

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.928
or would be the state's last chance

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:30.849
to demonstrate in this highly controversial
case that he was good for it.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.393
And Damien's reaction to that was

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:38.065
that he was absolutely adamant
about the DNA testing.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:42.694
JACKSON: Of all the samples and all the
various hairs and things that got tested,

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:46.949
there was nothing,
none of the DNA came back.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.785
Nothing matched Damien,
Jason or Jessie.

01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:55.415
What was interesting, however,
were some unknown hairs.

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:57.376
There was one hair in particular

01:03:57.543 --> 01:04:01.046
that was in the binding
of one of the ligatures.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.882
The boys had their hands
tied with shoelaces,

01:04:04.091 --> 01:04:07.261
and right in the middle of a knot
that had been tightened,

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:09.346
there was a hair jammed
in that knot.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:14.643
STIDHAM: Had the hair been located anywhere
other than inside a ligature binding,

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:18.856
I would say, you know,
it's not as significant as it could be.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.943
But given its location, I think
it's particularly damning evidence.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:26.697
JACKSON: The hair tied into Michael Moore's
ligature had to come from somebody.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:30.576
So over Christmas, 2006,
we studied John Douglas's report

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:34.371
and started to think about
who that foreign profile could belong to.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:39.251
LORRI: "This crime was not nearly
so convoluted nor as twisted

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:41.378
as the public were led to believe.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:45.424
John Douglas said that this
is most likely a personal-cause killing.

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:48.635
That is to say, the perpetrator knew
one or more of the victims

01:04:48.844 --> 01:04:53.682
and had good reason, at least
in his own mind, to act out violently.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:56.560
We know the boys were bashed
on the head, tied up,

01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:59.104
and thrown into the drainage ditch."

01:04:59.313 --> 01:05:02.858
The children were submerged in water,
which is an unnecessary act

01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:05.319
if you're a total--
You know, total stranger.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:09.698
And an unnecessary act to throw
the bicycles into the bayou.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:14.077
LORRI: "We know that all of this could have
happened in the space of just 2O minutes.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:16.455
It almost certainly happened
before dark,

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:20.292
which means the crime in all likelihood
occurred between the hours

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.171
of 6:30 and 7:45 p.m.

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:27.132
Who knew these boys
well enough to kill them?

01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:29.009
Who was out looking for them?

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:32.638
From where I stand we are pretty much
left with a list of three people.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:37.225
Mark Byers, Terry Hobbs,
and Todd Moore.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:41.563
Mark Byers began looking
for Chris from 6 p.m.

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:45.859
Terry Hobbs was looking
for Stevie Branch from 5 p.m.

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:48.111
Todd Moore was out of town.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.197
We're left with two stepfathers.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:53.867
But only one of them has ever been
scrutinized as a suspect.

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:58.163
Byers once referred to himself
as the giant red herring of this case,

01:05:58.372 --> 01:06:01.124
and I think
he was speaking the truth.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:04.503
That is why I am interested
in Terry Hobbs.

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:07.965
Hope this helps to explain
where I'm coming from.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:11.176
Sending much love to you, Fran."

01:06:12.678 --> 01:06:15.639
JACKSON: We were working with a
private investigator, Rachael Geiser,

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:18.433
and we asked Rachael
to start to investigate Terry.

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:23.438
I'd come in to work daily,
and I would have

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.108
all of these e-mails from Fran about:

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:28.777
"Here's what we need to do,
thanks for what you sent."

01:06:28.944 --> 01:06:31.279
We really didn't know
a whole lot about Stevie

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.865
because Stevie's life
was kind of confusing.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:37.995
PERETTI: These are the
photographs of Steven Branch.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:42.582
GEISER: You had his father,
Stevie, his biological father.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:43.959
PERETTI:
Here we can see...

01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:46.461
GEISER:
You had Pam, and then you had Terry.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:51.425
Other than the fact that nothing's there,
there's nothing that would raise any flags.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:54.761
JACKSON: And so getting Terry's
DNA became a priority for us now,

01:06:54.970 --> 01:07:00.726
and the brief to Rachael was really
get Terry's DNA without him knowing.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.731
GEISER: Saturday morning, it
was raining out, I remember,

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.733
and we showed up
at his house early,

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:11.445
and he opened the door,
and we told him who we were.

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.447
He said,
"I've been expecting y'all."

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:16.199
I'll never forget it, he was like,
"Come on in."

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:19.745
I remember we sat there with him
for a while, and he, you know...

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.706
He was a likable-enough guy,
he really was.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.542
He talked about their life
and how their life was.

01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:29.296
He didn't talk a whole lot about Pam.
I think they were fighting at the time.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:32.716
And he didn't talk, really,
about Amanda at all.

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.260
He interviewed with us,
told us where he was.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:39.097
He said that was the first time
he'd ever told anyone his whereabouts.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:42.684
So we waited in the living room
while he was in the bathroom, I assume,

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:47.522
and that's when I took the cigarette
butts out of the ashtray. Yeah.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.234
RIORDAN: We got the fax,
and I'm reading the fax,

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:56.740
and I'm reading the fax,
and at some point I said, "Holy fuck."

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:04.164
We all were just kind of stunned to see
this very dramatic DNA result.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.627
GEISER: Terry comes in, sits down,
and we tell him, you know...

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:12.297
LAX: The DNA that was found
on the hair doesn't match

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:14.966
Damien or Jason or Jessie.

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:19.845
So it's somebody else's DNA.
They don't know whose?

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:23.767
Tell me.
LAX: Yours.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:26.560
No.
LAX: Yes, it is.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.270
No, that's wrong.

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:33.276
GEISER: We had to get him to come in because we
knew that he didn't voluntarily give us this DNA.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.529
We wanted to get either a voluntary
sample or we need to see him

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:40.700
do something, you know,
that would have left his DNA.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:45.788
Terry Hobbs would not, at any point,
give me his DNA voluntarily, no.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:48.875
REPORTER 1: The biggest bombshell
of the new defense investigation

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:52.879
is that an unexplained hair that could
be from another victim's stepfather

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.423
was found on shoelaces
at the crime scene.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.969
REPORTER 2: They say the DNA matches victim
Stevie Branch's stepfather, Terry Hobbs.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.013
Hobbs tells me tonight, quote,
"I don't have anything to hide.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.430
I'll answer any questions."

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:08.728
Mr. Hobbs, do you feel like the attorneys
are accusing you of this crime?

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.522
The answer to that
would be no.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:14.067
Is it possible, Mr. Hobbs,
that that was your hair?

01:09:14.276 --> 01:09:20.615
Sure, it was his son, Steven Branch,

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:25.953
<i>who was murdered, and he's had
to deal with this for the last 15 years.</i>

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.082
[TRAIN HORN
BLARING IN DISTANCE]

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:39.968
[SNIFFLING]

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:43.971
AMANDA: The first tattoos I
got was my parents' name...

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:49.227
because I love them
more than anything in the world.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:53.314
I've abused drugs for many years
and I'm only 21

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.359
and I feel like it's because
I'm trying to hide.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:10:00.572
I did it to suppress something,
to cover something up.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.366
And where are your kids
during this time, at your mom's?

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.328
Mm-hm. They live with my mom.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:10.624
And so why don't you stay
with your mom?

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.375
She thinks I'm too wild.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.463
So she says, "You can't stay here
because you're too wild"?

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:21.426
And I'm hung out on a limb.

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.012
What's that mean,
you're hung out on a limb?

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:29.517
That I'm going crazy the way
she did when Stevie died.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.854
[Hr]

01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:38.193
HORGAN: Once Terry Hobbs surfaced,
it certainly advanced things.

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.070
It helped shift the momentum.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.406
JACKSON: The West Memphis
Police Department realized

01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:45.909
that they had never actually
interviewed him,

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:49.704
despite the fact that he was
a stepfather of one of the victims.

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:55.293
They quickly conducted an interview
with Terry Hobbs in 2007.

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:58.338
Anything unusual
when you got home, at all?

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.715
Nothing other than, uh,
Stevie wasn't home.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:05.220
Terry Hobbs said to everyone
that he was very concerned

01:11:05.387 --> 01:11:08.598
when Stevie Branch didn't
come home at 4:30 that night.

01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:14.104
If he was so worried at 4:30,
why didn't he call Stevie's mom?

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:19.943
When he does finally tell her,
9:00, almost five hours later.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:25.073
This person knows that he will be
a logical suspect at some point,

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:27.701
but what he needs,
he needs time on his hands.

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.744
He needs to establish an alibi.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.122
JACKSON:
We studied his movements that night.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.834
He had spent some period of time
on the evening of May the 5th

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.670
in the house of David Jacoby,
who was a friend of his.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:41.423
And I asked David, I said,
"Would you go help me?"

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.635
He was with me probably
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

01:11:45.844 --> 01:11:47.012
May the 6th.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.015
DOUGLAS:
Jacoby here is kind of a witness.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:53.685
He never had this window of opportunity
to perpetrate a crime like that

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:57.314
because he was with him
for such a long period of time.

01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:02.402
JACKSON: We got a sample of David
Jacoby's DNA voluntarily...

01:12:04.696 --> 01:12:07.490
and the analysis came back to say
that another hair

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.202
that was found on a tree stump by
the ditch where the bodies were found

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:15.206
was consistent
with David Jacoby's DNA.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.294
PAM: I wasn't even aware that
he went to David Jacoby's.

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:24.049
According to Terry, he was walking the
streets and searching the whole night.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:28.094
So that was news to me
when I found out.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:31.348
Is there anything you can think
of that we hadn't gone over?

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.517
That we hadn't asked, something
you remembered through the years?

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.854
HORGAN: You'd thought they would do a
meaningful interview with Terry Hobbs.

01:12:38.063 --> 01:12:41.441
It was as if they were sitting out
on the back porch just sharing a beer.

01:12:41.608 --> 01:12:44.611
"We know you didn't
have much to do with this.

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:49.115
Just, you know, for old time's sake,
why don't you describe again

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.534
how you didn't have anything
to do with this?"

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:54.704
It didn't have the atmosphere
of a serious interrogation at all.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:13:00.043
You know, I don't know what happened
out there in them woods that night.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.379
JACKSON: Mike Allen, the lead
investigator at the time,

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.672
and now the sheriff
of Crittenden County,

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:08.176
issued a statement saying
Terry Hobbs was not a suspect then

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:10.345
and he's not a suspect now.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:15.225
A question that has got to be asked
is that why have they so staunchly

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:19.187
refused to regard him
as a person of interest?

01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:23.650
There.
Terry, appreciate it, man.

01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:32.575
SCHECK: As we sit here today, there are
272 post-conviction DNA exonerations.

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:36.037
DNA is the essential element
to prove their innocence,

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:41.501
and these people have done
more than 3500 years in prison.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:45.630
On the other hand,
there are many, many cases, urn,

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:49.551
where there's been DNA that's helpful,
as in the West Memphis Three case,

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:54.556
because it does shed light
on other suspects.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:59.477
And it does put particular significance
on the absence of evidence.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:02.439
There's an old phrase
in the forensic science business

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:06.276
that absence of evidence
is not evidence of absence.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.069
Yeah, that's true.

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:11.322
On the other hand,
when you have DNA testing,

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:16.411
and you've gone through every piece
of trace evidence at a crime scene,

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:19.164
and you find nothing
that links the defendants

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.542
who have been convicted
to the crime, that is significant.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.502
[Hr]

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:28.173
REPORTER: This may be Damien Echols'
final appeal at the state level.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:31.926
If his arguments are denied,
the case then jumps into federal court.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:35.138
A decision is expected
in about a week.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:37.932
JACKSON: All the investigative
findings, the scientific results,

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:43.938
including the DNA, all of that is going
to be presented to Judge Burnett.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:50.111
Finally, Judge Burnett can consider
this case with all this new information

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.657
that wasn't available to him
or the prosecution back in 1994.

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:58.119
And so we were looking forward
to having him reevaluate the case.

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:01.372
We really had high hopes.

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:06.669
RIORDAN: We wanted to give the attorney
general some sense that it was coming.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.047
We told him that there'd be
these DNA results

01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:10.965
and we got into a discussion.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:13.384
What would you have
to show to get a new trial?

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:18.640
And there was a point of laughter
where one of them said:

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:22.268
"We're gonna set this bar
as high as we possibly can.

01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:25.313
Which is to say, we're gonna try
and get a court to rule

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:32.278
that it is really impossible to ever win
under the Arkansas DNA statute."

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:42.789
People ask us what we're gonna do
whenever I'm out, when we're together.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:45.792
And we do talk about that. Um...

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:50.505
For Lorri and I, life isn't something that
will happen one day down the road.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:53.132
You know, we're together now, here.

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:56.636
We're not just in a state
of suspended animation, waiting.

01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:59.556
LORRI:
He was 21, I guess, when I met him.

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:03.393
He hadn't yet really started studying
at that point, so it was kind of funny.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:07.355
You know, I was in a different place
in my life, and-- But now,

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:10.942
I mean, I would ask him for advice
before I would ask anybody.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:18.533
I send him a lot of used books,
and it is really fascinating to look at.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:22.912
Because when I'm reading a book
or when he's reading,

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.915
then we're going through--
As everyone does in their life.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:27.917
--You're going through
specific things.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:32.922
<i>OPERATOR:</i> [OVER <i>PHONE]:
You have 90 seconds left on this call.</i>

01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:36.759
<i>DAMIEN: Uh, I don't normally read a lot of fiction anymore.
I haven't for several years,</i>

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:39.095
<i>but a couple of days ago,</i>

01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:41.347
<i>someone sent me
the new Stephen King book.</i>

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:45.351
<i>You know, I started reading his books
when I was probably 10 or 11 years old.</i>

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:49.105
<i>People have always
undervalued him.</i>

01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:52.442
<i>You know,
they look at him as this, um, hack.</i>

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:56.487
<i>This hack writer who churns out
horror novels.</i>

01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:59.741
<i>In all of his books at the end,
he always addresses the reader.</i>

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:03.369
<i>You know, he thanks you for going on
this voyage with him,</i>

01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:05.997
<i>and so I wanted to read it to you.</i>

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:09.375
<i>"All right, I think we've been down here
in the dark long enough.</i>

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:12.045
<i>There's a whole other world upstairs.</i>

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.755
<i>Take my hand, constant reader,</i>

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.966
<i>and I'll be happy to lead you
back into the sunshine.</i>

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.259
[Hr]

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:22.597
<i>I'm happy to go there because I believe
most people are essentially good.</i>

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.974
<i>I know that I am.</i>

01:17:25.183 --> 01:17:28.227
<i>It's you I'm not entirely sure of."</i>

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:35.151
REPORTER 1:
A judge says no to new trial.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.198
REPORTER 2: Judge Burnett made it clear that
the DNA evidence isn't enough for a new trial

01:17:40.365 --> 01:17:43.034
or to overturn the conviction.

01:17:43.201 --> 01:17:45.244
David Burnett wouldn't hear
the new evidence.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.747
He complete--
He denied it without even hearing it.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:54.212
What can you do? I mean, in our minds,
we started to entertain the idea

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.798
that Damien might be executed.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:02.136
BURNETT: My life would have been a lot simpler
if I hadn't been involved in that case.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:07.975
I had to fiddle with it for 18 years
and get beaten over the head by folks

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.645
that were opposed to what happened.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:14.816
But I didn't pick and choose,
I just took what came down the pipe.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:18.486
It's not unusual
for post-conviction motions

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:21.864
to be made in front of the judge
that originally heard the trial.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:25.201
The theory behind that is the judge
who originally heard the trial

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.120
saw all the witnesses testify

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:30.081
and is in the best position
to evaluate the new evidence.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:37.296
But all of us are victims of bias that
we don't even understand or know,

01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:40.383
and sometimes you have
to abandon hypotheses

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:42.677
that you've relied on in the past

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:46.097
and try to freshly evaluate
the evidence.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:51.269
All of this hoop-de-la about
newly discovered evidence.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:53.438
There is no
newly discovered evidence.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:59.944
All of the evidence that was found
originally at the trial scene.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.030
[Hr]

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.660
JACKSON: Judge David Burnett finally
decides to stand for Senate.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.413
We hoped like hell
that he would get elected.

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.457
Because once he was elected
to Senate,

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:15.543
he was unable to have anything
to do with this case anymore.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:17.754
[CROWD CHEERING]

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.383
<i>ROLLINS: So Judge Burnett
heard what he heard,</i>

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:25.303
<i>and he and his jury
made their decision.</i>

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:29.223
<i>It was up to people from all over
the world, and that would be you.</i>

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.267
<i>And the people next to you
right now,</i>

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:35.772
<i>coming together to make
some real justice happen.</i>

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:40.067
I would like to read something
to you guys.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:47.658
"I can't remember what it's like to walk
as a human being anymore.

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:51.996
It's been well over 16 years since
I've actually walked anywhere.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:55.333
There are times when I've thought,

01:19:55.917 --> 01:20:00.922
surely, someone is gonna put
a stop to this.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.383
Oh, well, it does no good
to dwell on it.

01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:09.514
Either I waste my energy by focusing
on things I cannot change,

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:14.685
or I conserve my energy, and
apply it to small things I can change."

01:20:14.894 --> 01:20:19.899
Each small thing connects
to make a great, big thing.

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:23.861
And that big thing is
to bring those boys back home.

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:25.905
This is something
I came across today

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:30.284
and it's just a small paragraph of one
of Damien's letters from this February.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:37.500
"The thing I like most about time
is that it's not real. It's all in the head.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:42.588
There's no such thing as the past,
it exists only in the memory.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:47.093
There's no such thing as the future,
it exists only in our imagination.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:51.806
If our watches were truly accurate,
the only thing they would ever say

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.600
is 'now."'

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.103
[CHEERING]

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.730

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:24.065
One day, I get a phone call
from my manager

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:26.651
saying Terry Hobbs is suing me.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.904
LORRI: "Dearest Lorri, are the
Dixie Chicks fighting this?

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:33.407
This is a great opportunity to give
Terry Hobbs his day in court,

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:36.953
get all the facts out in the open
and let a jury decide."

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:39.246
BAILIFF:
You swear to tell nothing but the truth,

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.083
so help you God?
I do.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.335
DAVISON:
State your name for the record, sir.

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:45.503
Terry Hobbs.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.213
<i>DAWSON".
You can put your hand down now.</i>

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.466
Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen
why you sued my client?

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:57.556
All of the emotions, distress,
the anger.

01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:02.228
<i>DAWSON".
That her statements caused you'?</i>

01:23:02.395 --> 01:23:04.105
Correct.

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:09.860
I didn't say anything about him. I had no
intentions of finger-pointing at Terry Hobbs.

01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:13.072
I don't even know
that Terry Hobbs did it.

01:23:13.239 --> 01:23:16.534
I sort of asked my attorney,
"Why would he be doing this?"

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:20.579
He was confident
that he was gonna win

01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:23.582
and he was gonna get
millions of dollars.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.751
I think he's gutsy.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.423
He had to have been warned that if he
did that, he would have to be deposed,

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:33.175
which he was,
and have to answer questions.

01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:35.469
JACKSON: We gave Natalie's
attorney, D'Lesli Davis,

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:39.849
access to our investigative files
on Terry, his background,

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:43.310
his relationship with Stevie.
And it enabled them to basically

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:47.648
sit him down
and to finally question him

01:23:47.857 --> 01:23:52.903
in a way that he had never, ever been
questioned about this murder before.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:58.451
Describe your reputation, other than just
"a good man." What else would it be?

01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:03.247
A hard-working man, good dad,
good husband in the past.

01:24:03.414 --> 01:24:04.790
Uh...

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:06.125
Pretty good man.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:09.545
Are you an honest fellow?
I try my best.

01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:12.715
Law-abiding man?
I do pretty good at it.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.635
GEISER: We started doing
background on Terry.

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:20.056
I went to Garland County because
I knew he had lived there before,

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:24.018
specifically to interview his ex-wife.
And it raised some flags at that point.

01:24:24.185 --> 01:24:26.187
[Hr]

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:37.782
She told me he had gotten in trouble.
I went to the court records

01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:41.702
in Garland County and was able to pull
that incident involving Mildred French.

01:24:41.869 --> 01:24:46.540
Let me give you a minute to go through
the declaration of Mildred French.

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:51.128
All right.
D'LESLl: Have you read it?

01:24:51.337 --> 01:24:52.379
No, I'm not going to.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.590
Why not?
It don't mean nothing to me.

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:57.927
Why doesn't it mean anything to you?
It just don't.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:01.514
Mildred French was a neighbor of yours
back in the '80s, wasn't she?

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:03.349
I don't remember.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.645
D'LESLl: Paragraph number four, "On
one occasion I heard a baby crying

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:12.608
and sounds that indicated to me that Terry
Hobbs was beating his wife and/or his child."

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.903
She kind of let out a cry,

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:18.239
and then I heard the baby.

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:20.074
D'LESLl:
"I ran next door to Terry's unit

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.576
and rang the bell
to Terry Hobbs' residence."

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:24.537
He said it was none of my business,

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:27.665
and I said, "I'm making it my business,
you do it again."

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.834
I said,
"Because I've heard you before."

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.752
D'LESLl:
Do you recall she was your neighbor?

01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:33.129
Some old woman was.

01:25:33.337 --> 01:25:35.673
"A few months later,
I worked outside in my yard.

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:39.343
I went inside my home to take a shower
and get cleaned up."

01:25:39.552 --> 01:25:44.598
FRECH: And I got out of the tub and when
I was reaching in to get the towel...

01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:46.725
D'LESLl:
"Terry Hobbs, who had broken in

01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:50.437
and somehow gotten upstairs
into my bathroom..."

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:54.358
I didn't see him come into the bathroom.
He just grabbed me on my breasts.

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:58.362
D'LESLl: "I screamed at Terry loudly,
'What are you doing in my house?'

01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:01.657
And screamed, 'Get out!"'
FRENCH: He said, "Shh! Shh!"

01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:04.952
D'LESLl: "I kept repeating loudly."
FRENCH: "Get out of my house!"

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:09.290
D'LESLl: "And ultimately Terry ran out of
my home and ran downstairs into his unit."

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.500
What is your recollection
of those events--?

01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:13.586
I don't have any.
Let me finish.

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:17.089
What is your recollection of the reason
that the police were called

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:20.301
and those events that Ms. French
remembers so clearly?

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:21.760
I don't have any.

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:24.555
"I said to Terry,
'Tell them what you did to me.'

01:26:24.722 --> 01:26:28.517
Terry looked at me square in the eye
and said calmly, 'It never happened.'

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:33.063
I looked at Terry and told him,
'You are a liar and you are sick.â€œ

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:37.568
And I say, "You know, you're sick."
And he says, "Yeah, I'm sick."

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.487
I never did like him, I mean...

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.531
Even when Pam first married him,

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.660
.there was just always something.
He creeped me out.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.537
DAVISON:
Do you lose your temper very often?

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.914
No.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.666
Pretty even-keeled guy?
Try to be.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:54.793
PAM:
He's got a look that's plum evil,

01:26:55.419 --> 01:27:00.549
and when that look of evil comes
over him, you know, I know he's mad.

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:06.472
What-- What's this?
DAVISON: It is a judgment

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:13.354
against one Terry W. Hobbs
for aggravated assault in '94,

01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:16.941
in conjunction with the shooting
of your brother-in-law.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:20.110
Is that your signature at the bottom
of the first page, sir?

01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:21.904
It is.

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:27.117
He can snap into a nice guy
and a bad guy by a snap of a finger.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:29.453
D'LESLl:
You did backhand Pam Hobbs

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.914
the night you ended up
shooting her brother,

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.374
correct?
Okay.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.584
Is that correct?
Yeah. All right.

01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:36.835
Is that funny?

01:27:37.044 --> 01:27:40.756
Well, it's-- You get tired of talking
about it after a while.

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:44.009
I need, for the record, for you
to state under oath that you did

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.637
I did.
backhand Pam Hobbs.

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:49.139
PAM:
It was over a jealousy of a woman.

01:27:49.348 --> 01:27:51.976
I was just trying to get away
and calm down, cool off,

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:55.437
and come back home,
and he wouldn't let me have the keys.

01:27:55.646 --> 01:27:57.982
So he punched me pretty hard
that day.

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.235
D'LESLl: Were you jealous over the
attention that Pam gave to Stevie?

01:28:01.402 --> 01:28:03.320
No.
Did you compete with Stevie

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:05.447
for Pam's attention?
No.

01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:10.703
He had made a comment to his mom
that I paid more attention to my son

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:14.665
than I did, you know,
being a wife, so...

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:20.296
JUDY: Stevie started talking to me
probably when he was about 6 years old,

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:23.340
and he wanted to know
if I could keep a secret.

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:27.303
And I told him, yeah, because we were
really-- We were very, very close.

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.680
Kind of like, you know,
grew up together.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.932
Because I was 8 years old
when he was born.

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:34.852
Daddy Terry, as he called him,
was mean to him.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:38.105
And that he-- He treated him
different than Amanda.

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:44.320
The very first thing he ever told me
is about how he would whup him.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:47.990
Make him hold his hands up
in the air,

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.534
and he would hold him
by the hair of his head

01:28:50.743 --> 01:28:52.077
while he was whupping him.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:54.788
D'LESLl: He'd hold their hands
in the air as he whipped them.

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:58.751
Sometimes when he whipped Stevie,
he would leave belt marks on him.

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:01.128
Is that true?
No.

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:04.089
Is it true you whipped Stevie with a belt?
Yes.

01:29:04.298 --> 01:29:07.885
Is it true that you whipped Stevie and
made him hold his hands up in the air?

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.887
I didn't want to hit him
on the hands.

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:11.805
So that's true?
Yes.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:14.725
The only thing that's not true
about paragraph number 1O

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:17.061
is that you would leave
belt marks on him?

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:18.312
Not that I recall.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.358
MARIE: Stevie had a belt mark on him,
and I asked Pam who whipped him.

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.777
I thought she had
and she said Terry did.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:28.405
She didn't want to tell at first,
but she finally told me.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:33.786
Stevie never would tell us because
he's afraid he'd get beat to death

01:29:33.994 --> 01:29:35.537
or whatever when he got home.

01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:39.583
JUDY: And about locking him up in the
closet if he didn't do what he was told

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:42.211
right when he was told.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:43.587
CINDY:
I lived with them.

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:45.798
I was around them off and on.

01:29:46.215 --> 01:29:48.759
It was a happy time.

01:29:48.926 --> 01:29:50.302
I've got pictures,

01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:53.639
everybody's smiling,
everybody's happy.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:57.393
Everybody's swimming,
everybody's having a good time.

01:29:57.935 --> 01:30:01.480
There was no fighting
and screaming and hollering

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.525
and beating the kids
and stuff like that.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:08.404
I can't say, "I wish he wouldn't
have married her." I can now.

01:30:08.612 --> 01:30:11.573
Back then I didn't know her
enough to say, "Ew."

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.743
But I do now, so, "Ew."

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:20.416
Then he got into a little more detail about
things that were happening about...

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:29.425
Terry would come into his room
while he was asleep or going to sleep...

01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:34.763
and he would make
Stevie watch him masturbate.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.932
[Hr]

01:30:38.142 --> 01:30:43.730
It progressed so much that he started
making Stevie mess with Amanda.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.732
D'LESLl: Is that true, sir?
No, it's not true.

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:50.237
Can you think of any reason that
Judy Sadler would say that about you

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:53.532
if she had not heard that from Stevie?
You'd have to ask Judy.

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.742
Can you think of any reason?
No.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:59.955
She's told me about that,
but I really feel like, if that was true,

01:31:00.122 --> 01:31:04.710
why didn't you say that
16, 17, or 18 years ago?

01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:07.921
Why do you wait
this long to say it?

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.175
Because maybe if it would have
been true and she said something,

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:16.180
then my mom would've kept me,
she would've fought for me.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:19.349
MEEKS: This is kind of a new thing
for y'all, this therapy stuff,

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:24.271
so that's pretty stressful.
But you'll get comfortable with that.

01:31:25.272 --> 01:31:30.694
"Guilt. I feel guilty practically all the time."
Can you put a finger on the guilt?

01:31:30.903 --> 01:31:34.114
Where's that guilt coming from?
I don't know.

01:31:34.323 --> 01:31:36.575
Just can't seem
to pick it out, huh?

01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:40.996
D'LESLl: Attached here, too, is exhibit
one, pages from Amanda Hobbs' journal

01:31:41.205 --> 01:31:43.332
in her handwriting.

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:46.543
"You know, I think I'm the only
19-year-old that can't remember

01:31:46.752 --> 01:31:49.213
what happened in my life
10 years ago.

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:54.593
Was I traumatized as a child that
I had to turn to drugs to forget about it?

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:57.888
I used to tell my mom,
'My dad messed with me.'

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.641
I honestly don't remember.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:06.271
I used to dream about my dad having
sex with me, but it was just a dream.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.691
As far as I remember,
my dad never touched me sexually,

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.569
but he beat the hell out of me."

01:32:12.778 --> 01:32:18.951
He hit me one time with a belt,
but he used the buckle.

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:24.414
And it left a welt, probably that thick,
across my whole back and it was purple.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:29.044
D'LESLl: Is it still your testimony
you never hit your daughter?

01:32:29.253 --> 01:32:30.379
Correct.

01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:33.507
D'LESLl:
You never sexually molested her?

01:32:33.674 --> 01:32:34.967
TERRY:
Never one time.

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:39.304
D'LESLl: When we talk about emotional or
other problems your daughter has had,

01:32:39.972 --> 01:32:42.641
you do not feel you are
responsible for any of those.

01:32:42.808 --> 01:32:44.601
Is that correct?
Correct.

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:49.815
PAM: I know Stevie asked me about
two weeks before he was murdered

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:52.276
to leave Terry,
and I asked him why.

01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:56.613
And he said, "He loves Amanda,
but he don't love me."

01:32:57.573 --> 01:32:59.992
[Hr]

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:07.082
I feel like I'm putting the pieces
of a puzzle together and I'm so scared.

01:33:08.125 --> 01:33:11.878
Talking to Terry over things
that's happened and all that,

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.591
they did their job,
they got the right ones, and all this.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:23.348
I just want the truth.
I want the answers.

01:33:24.975 --> 01:33:26.184
[SNIFFLING]

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:30.689
Since the program aired,
convictions were handed down

01:33:30.897 --> 01:33:35.652
to all three of the accused teenagers,
and it became undeniable

01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:39.448
that the brutal murders
had been part of a Satanic ritual.

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:42.784
Back with us today,
Pam and Terry Hobbs.

01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:44.578
I mean, all murder is horrible.

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:47.789
Is the manner of his,
the specific manner in which he died,

01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.626
is that something
that will always haunt you?

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:54.546
Yeah, I'll go to my grave with it,
thinking about it.

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:56.590
I realize my son
is in a better place.

01:33:56.798 --> 01:34:00.510
STIDHAM: I got a phone call back
in 2003 about the Hobbs knives

01:34:00.719 --> 01:34:04.514
that Pam discovered
when their marriage went south.

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:05.807
[Hr]

01:34:05.974 --> 01:34:08.935
PAM: What stuck out to our attention
is Stevie's knife in there.

01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:13.815
STIDHAM: According to Pam, that knife
would have been in the boy's pocket

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:17.527
the day that he was murdered,
and so that was very interesting.

01:34:17.736 --> 01:34:20.697
MORIARTY: How did he get it? More
important, when did he get it?

01:34:20.906 --> 01:34:26.411
Pam says she knows Stevie Branch
had it until he died. Terry Hobbs says...

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.291
I was his dad,
I was acting as a responsible parent.

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.754
Not letting a 6-, 7-, 8-year-old little boy
carry a pocket knife.

01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:38.215
DAVISON: Aren't you aware
that his mommy, his mother,

01:34:38.382 --> 01:34:42.135
said that he carried the knife with him
up until the time that he disappeared?

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:43.887
So?

01:34:44.096 --> 01:34:45.972
And she stated
that she didn't trust

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:51.019
the prosecution and she wanted
to turn it over to the defense.

01:34:51.228 --> 01:34:55.148
DAVISON: I'm asking if it surprised you,
given the fact that the West Memphis Police

01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:58.777
has spent so much time
and so much money over the years

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:03.782
saying they got it right, that when
DNA attributed to someone else

01:35:03.949 --> 01:35:06.368
was found in the ligature
of one of the victims

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.621
that they attributed it
to secondary transfer?

01:35:10.831 --> 01:35:14.751
What if it was secondary transfer?
What if it wasn't?

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.963
What are you saying?
I'm saying there could be a question

01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:21.425
about whether or not you were
somehow involved in these crimes.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:23.343
Well, who says that?

01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:27.180
How do you explain
Mr. Jacoby's DNA?

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:30.559
Which is the second--
I have no explanation for that.

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:34.855
ATTORNEY: Objection to form--
We was in them woods all night.

01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:42.904
JACOBY:
The first time I heard about DNA was

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:45.991
the lack of DNA at the crime scene.

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:53.790
The first time I heard about my DNA,
it was just shock therapy, I think.

01:35:53.999 --> 01:35:56.752
Telling me that they found my DNA
at the crime scene.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.921
Sleepless nights, you know,
going over and over,

01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:04.551
trying to see if there was something
you missed or something you heard or...

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:07.095
[SIGHS]

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:10.932
DAVISON: It's your testimony Mr. Jacoby
was with you all night in the woods?

01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:14.561
We were together quite a bit that night.
No, that's not my question.

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:17.272
You testified earlier
that you and Mr. Jacoby

01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:19.608
were together all night
until it was time

01:36:19.775 --> 01:36:21.401
for him to go to work.
Exactly.

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:24.821
Is that your story, or are you changing it?
TERRY: No, we were.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.950
JACOBY: So I'm at home and I
hear a knock on the door.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.535
And it's Terry and Amanda.

01:36:30.744 --> 01:36:33.163
I ask him what's he doing. He says:

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:36.166
"Oh, looking for Stevie,
he was supposed to be home."

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:38.168
D'LESLl: "Terry and Amanda
came inside my house.

01:36:38.335 --> 01:36:41.546
Amanda played with toys and Terry
and I sat down and played guitars

01:36:41.755 --> 01:36:44.841
for up to one hour." You've
already stated that it's possible

01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:47.844
you went to David's house
and played guitars for one hour.

01:36:48.011 --> 01:36:50.722
I didn't say that.
You said that in your last deposition.

01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:52.682
I don't recall playing the guitars.

01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:56.436
I went over to see if David would
help me look for the three little boys.

01:36:56.645 --> 01:36:58.855
JACOBY:
"Pretty Woman," Roy Orbison.

01:36:59.064 --> 01:37:02.692
I handed him my guitar and asked him
to play that part of that song again,

01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:07.113
so I could get it down and he--
We did that two or three times,

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:09.950
you know, before I finally got it right.

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:13.578
So, you know,
a little time went by and he says:

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:17.123
"Well, you know,
I need to go look for Stevie."

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:21.378
I said, "Terry, let me know.
Let me know where you find him."

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:23.588
[Hr]

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:28.385
DAVISON: Did you see Stevie
at all that day, May the 5th?

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:31.763
No, I did not.

01:37:33.682 --> 01:37:35.851
Did you see any
of the three boys that day?

01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:38.019
No, I did not.

01:37:38.228 --> 01:37:42.190
JAMIE: I think the timeframe is what
pulled us in more than anything else,

01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:44.234
because I was like, "Wait a minute."

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:46.945
We went to church every Wednesday
at the same time.

01:37:47.153 --> 01:37:50.782
We left about 6:30 every single
Wednesday, we never missed church.

01:37:50.991 --> 01:37:53.118
And we saw them out there.

01:37:53.326 --> 01:37:57.122
Terry Hobbs and Steven Branch
lived three houses down from us

01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:59.040
on South McAuley.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:04.671
About 6:30, we came out the door
and Steven was in front on his bike.

01:38:04.838 --> 01:38:07.841
Christopher and Michael
were running behind him,

01:38:08.008 --> 01:38:09.843
and they zoomed out real fast.

01:38:10.010 --> 01:38:12.804
I told Christopher,
I yelled to him, "You need to go home.

01:38:13.013 --> 01:38:14.681
Your brother said to go home."

01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:17.517
He said, "I don't have to do
what you tell me to do."

01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:21.271
And I saw Terry walking down
the sidewalk, and he was saying:

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:24.816
"Y'all come back down here,"
and they all went in that direction

01:38:25.025 --> 01:38:28.653
toward him and we got in the car
and went to church.

01:38:28.862 --> 01:38:31.865
The next day at school,
Ryan came up to us and he said

01:38:32.032 --> 01:38:35.243
they couldn't find his brother,
his brother didn't come home.

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:37.954
I told him, "I saw your brother,
I talked to him.

01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:40.540
I told him to come home.
What are you talking about?"

01:38:40.707 --> 01:38:42.542
He was really devastated,
he was crying.

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:46.421
And he said that they found his brother,
and he wasn't alive anymore.

01:38:46.630 --> 01:38:47.797
We knew we saw him,

01:38:48.006 --> 01:38:50.717
but we thought,
"There, his dad was out there with him.

01:38:50.884 --> 01:38:53.136
Surely, they told him
that they were down there."

01:38:53.303 --> 01:38:56.222
So we thought all this time
that they already knew.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:03.313
If deemed credible, it's more damning
than even the DNA evidence, you know.

01:39:03.521 --> 01:39:07.359
I mean, the last person to be
in the presence of these three victims.

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:11.446
By denying that occurred, rather than
offering any explanation of it,

01:39:11.655 --> 01:39:13.949
it's awfully powerful stuff.

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:16.034
DOUGLAS: These people here
were never interviewed.

01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:17.786
They were just neighbors of Hobbs.

01:39:17.953 --> 01:39:20.288
Hobbs wasn't interviewed.
Didn't do a neighborhood.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:23.458
They'll swear on a stack of Bibles
that they saw Terry Hobbs

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:27.379
with the three children around 6:30.
I don't know how many years

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:30.757
before anybody had asked me
anything about it too.

01:39:30.924 --> 01:39:32.592
D'LESLl:
You say you were not ever alone

01:39:32.801 --> 01:39:35.553
on the night of May 5th
and the morning of May 6th,

01:39:35.762 --> 01:39:41.935
and yet David Jacoby
says you left his house twice, alone.

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:44.521
DOUGLAS:
What Jacoby has told us so far

01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:49.901
is that it could be two hours where
Terry Hobbs can't be accounted for.

01:39:50.110 --> 01:39:52.737
D'LESLIE: I'm saying that you
don't have an alibi witness

01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:56.241
for two to two and a half hours
on the evening of the murders.

01:39:56.449 --> 01:40:00.662
From 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
I don't know.

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:02.789
Does that concern you?
No.

realize that he was being set up

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.908
by Terry Hobbs as an alibi.

01:41:26.664 --> 01:41:29.167
At the time, I wasn't looking
for three murdered kids.

01:41:29.375 --> 01:41:31.503
I was helping my friend
look for his kid

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:33.755

with another kid

01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:35.799
who happened to be
with another kid.

Yeah.

come back, you know? Fuck.

Why do you not come back
to your friend's house to help you

01:41:52.357 --> 01:41:54.109
if you can't find your kid?
Yeah.

01:41:54.943 --> 01:41:57.779
I stopped myself from saying
that he did it,

01:41:57.987 --> 01:41:59.572
you know, in all these years.

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:02.450

said he couldn't...

It gets to the point, I'd give my
life to know the fucking truth.

01:42:09.124 --> 01:42:10.750
Fucking Terry.

01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:16.756
But I've been that little kid,
you know?

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:20.885
You been that step--? That stepchild?
That stepkid, yeah.

That gets his ass whupped
at the drop of a hat for--

01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:29.352
You know, for something
somebody else's done.

01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:33.064
And you catch what's
built up from everybody else.

01:42:33.273 --> 01:42:38.862
And that, I felt that with Stevie.
I mean, like with the marbles.

01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:42.365
He's throwing marbles
and bouncing them off the wall.

01:42:42.574 --> 01:42:45.451
Terry is telling him,
"I'm gonna bust your ass. Quit.

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.954
Stevie, I'm gonna bust your ass.
Stevie, quit.

01:42:48.163 --> 01:42:50.748
Stevie, quit. I'm gonna tell you
one more time, Stevie."

And, you know, you just want--
You wanna get that last marble.

And Stevie's looking like that
last marble's fixing to come again,

01:42:57.463 --> 01:43:01.509
and I said, you know, "Sit down, let me
show you how we played marbles."

01:43:01.718 --> 01:43:05.138
And it got Terry, you know,
off of him, and...

01:43:05.597 --> 01:43:06.890

Terry hated him.

01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:10.435
What he did to him
to make him hate him, I don't know.

01:43:10.643 --> 01:43:13.479
Stevie was scared of Terry.

01:43:14.022 --> 01:43:18.860
He was hid in the closet, and I asked
him why he was hid in a closet.

01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:22.155
You know, he had
a mishap in his underwear

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:24.157
and Daddy Terry would whip him.

01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:28.703
And one time he had thrown him
against the wall.

01:43:28.912 --> 01:43:32.207
DOUGLAS: I do not believe
the homicide was planned.

01:43:32.415 --> 01:43:37.253
This person responsible for the murders
lost control and had to kill them.

01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:41.090
They were already heading that way, and
he said, "Get back down to the house."

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:44.052
And they passed him,
they were laughing and playing.

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:46.054
We thought it was a normal day.

01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:48.139
It was things we saw them do
all the time.

01:43:48.348 --> 01:43:52.143

that you become physically abusive?

01:43:52.352 --> 01:43:53.394
Correct.

D'LESLl: You do not fly into rages?
Correct.

01:44:00.777 --> 01:44:03.279
And you do not beat your children?
Never.

01:44:03.488 --> 01:44:07.242
If he was capable of doing this,
and I can almost picture it,

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:11.204
that he freaked out, and the other
two boys being there, um...

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:16.125
They've got skull fractures,
they've got brain injuries.

01:44:16.334 --> 01:44:19.754
If it had been an accident,
the Terry Hobbs that I know,

01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:23.800
no, I don't think that he would say
that, "I accidentally did this.

01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:27.428
I'm sorry," and turn himself in for it.

01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:32.850
BADEN: These children were alive until
they inhaled water and drowned.

01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:36.437
To do what he did to the children,
hide the clothing, hide the children,

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:38.064
he got in water, got muddy.

01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:40.733
DAVISON: There's been some
discussion about you doing laundry

01:44:40.942 --> 01:44:43.319
the evening of the 5th
or the morning of the 6th.

01:44:43.486 --> 01:44:45.405
Recall that?
It didn't happen.

01:44:45.571 --> 01:44:47.031
DAVISON: You didn't do laundry?
TERRY: No.

01:44:47.198 --> 01:44:51.244
I saw him cleaning.
I saw him washing clothes.

01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:54.789
I saw him in Stevie's room.

01:44:54.998 --> 01:44:58.084
I mean, he had bleach and everything
and was cleaning.

01:44:58.251 --> 01:45:01.838
I had never seen Terry
clean anything

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:03.631
the whole time I had known him.

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.677
When he took me to work, I believe
Terry changed into a purple tank top,

01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:10.263
a pair of shorts
and his LA Gear tennis shoes.

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:12.390
He's muddy,
he has to change his clothing.

01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:14.183
PAM:
When he picked me up from work,

01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:18.980
he was in blue jeans
and flannel top shirt on.

01:45:19.147 --> 01:45:21.566

and wait to be interviewed.

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:25.820
D'LESLl: And you have a dispute with every
single one of your alibi witnesses.

01:45:26.029 --> 01:45:30.033
If you put
all of these statements together,

01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:33.328
and all the evidence together
that I've just run through,

01:45:33.536 --> 01:45:35.288
and you're the police,

01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:38.166
wouldn't you wanna look
at Terry Hobbs for this murder?

01:45:38.374 --> 01:45:40.793
You'd have to look
at Terry Hobbs.

01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:44.255
DOUGLAS:
From an investigative perspective,

01:45:44.464 --> 01:45:49.344
it solidifies Terry Hobbs
as the principal suspect.

01:45:49.552 --> 01:45:52.764
It's gonna be tough
for someone like him to confess.

01:45:52.972 --> 01:45:55.391
If he is in fact the guy,
it's extremely tough.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.479
He's had 18 years to think about it.
He's got an answer for everything.

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:03.524
You throw him a pitch, he's got it.
You know, he knows how to hit it.

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:11.991
The attorney general's office
has taken the position

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.870
that not only should these
wrongly convicted young men

01:46:16.037 --> 01:46:18.539
not have the opportunity
to prove their innocence,

01:46:18.748 --> 01:46:22.502
but that no one ever in Arkansas

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:26.172
be given that opportunity
on the grounds that Arkansas

01:46:26.381 --> 01:46:30.385
is incapable
of ever convicting anyone wrongly.

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:35.139
It's one thing to build perception
that there's something wrong.

01:46:35.306 --> 01:46:39.477
It's another thing to get
a formal judgment overturning it.

01:46:39.644 --> 01:46:46.317
There are still some formidable
legal obstacles to opening that door.

If I've had to be the spotlight
of people thinking I was involved,

01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:05.837
if that kept the case alive
to get where we are today,

01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:08.297
I'd turn around

in this case that has changed your mind.

01:47:14.095 --> 01:47:16.931
Because that day,
you believed he was the killer.

That day I believed
what the state told me.

01:47:19.517 --> 01:47:22.437
And it took quite a while
of being blinded,

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:25.064
and when I finally
got my answers,

01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:29.235
none of the roads
led to the three in prison.

01:47:29.444 --> 01:47:32.238
All the roads and all the evidence

01:47:32.405 --> 01:47:36.159
lead to Terry Wayne Hobbs.

01:47:42.206 --> 01:47:44.375
This case is outrageous.

01:47:44.542 --> 01:47:48.296
People need to get involved and help
on this case. I am happy to get involved,

01:47:48.504 --> 01:47:51.466
donating my time,
time from my law firm, pro bono,

01:47:51.674 --> 01:47:54.594
because these young men
need a fair trial.

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:59.265
If they're convicted again? Fine.
But do it fair. Do it constitutionally.

01:47:59.474 --> 01:48:02.310
It's an endurance test
to keep up with this.

01:48:02.518 --> 01:48:05.146
I think I was in my late 20s
when I first heard about it.

01:48:05.354 --> 01:48:07.607
I am now 45.

01:48:08.691 --> 01:48:12.778
We'd buy Doritos and Skittles
and M&M's.

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:17.074
And we'd sit down, and I'll have napkins
and then Damien would say:

01:48:17.283 --> 01:48:20.203
"All right, put out your napkin,
okay, try this, all right.

01:48:20.411 --> 01:48:23.247
One Ruffle, two orange Skittles.

01:48:23.456 --> 01:48:25.082
All right, get the root beer ready.

01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:28.085
Now eat that, drink that
at the same time, isn't that crazy?"

01:48:28.252 --> 01:48:30.087
[LAUGHS]

01:48:30.963 --> 01:48:35.801
It's a long, long process. We've all had
to educate ourselves and learn patience.

01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:38.429
We'd make a small breakthrough

01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:42.016
or something and Lorri and I would
have a long two-hour phone call.

01:48:42.225 --> 01:48:43.392
We'd get off the phone,

01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:47.438
think this is gonna be a happy ending.
There's gotta be a happy ending to this.

01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:51.067
BRAGA: One thing that could
happen is they could say no.

01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:52.652
"Judge Burnett was right.

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.698
You lose, no new hearing, Damien.
Sorry, done."

01:48:57.907 --> 01:49:00.701
And then he literally is done
in the Arkansas court.

01:49:00.868 --> 01:49:02.870
[Hr]

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:07.083
JUDGE 1:
The oral argument today

01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:11.128
<i>ts Damien Wayne Echols
v. the State of Arkansas.</i>

01:49:11.337 --> 01:49:14.757
RIORDAN: So we have a situation
here where the Arkansas legislature

01:49:14.966 --> 01:49:20.388
passed these statutes out of, quote,
"In response to nationwide concerns

01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:22.848
that innocent persons
were being imprisoned

01:49:23.057 --> 01:49:25.935
and even executed
for crimes that they did not commit."

01:49:26.143 --> 01:49:29.146
However, the state takes the position

01:49:29.355 --> 01:49:34.360
that the only evidence other than DNA
allowed in a DNA action in this state

01:49:34.569 --> 01:49:36.571
is evidence of guilt.

01:49:36.779 --> 01:49:39.407
The fact of the matter is
that DNA evidence

01:49:39.615 --> 01:49:42.243
that couldn't have been obtained
15 years ago

01:49:42.451 --> 01:49:44.620
begins to make things relevant.

01:49:44.787 --> 01:49:47.957
Connect to other evidence that did
not appear relevant 15 years ago.

01:49:48.165 --> 01:49:52.336
So your interpretation is it's not
really just new scientific evidence.

01:49:52.545 --> 01:49:54.797
It's new evidence
across the board that'll come?

01:49:55.006 --> 01:49:56.048
RIORDAN:
Yes, Your Honor.

01:49:56.257 --> 01:49:58.342
RAUPP:
The animating purpose of this statute

01:49:58.551 --> 01:50:02.471
is not to do away
with finality of judgments,

01:50:02.638 --> 01:50:05.725
but to test evidence of innocence.

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:08.728
Doesn't that include
the last 17 years?

01:50:09.437 --> 01:50:12.064
No, well, I'm sorry.
Does it include the last...?

01:50:12.273 --> 01:50:16.152
The last 17 years, or are you limiting
the evidence that can be presented?

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:20.114
RAUPP: You can't bring in evidence that
is just further reweighing of evidence

01:50:20.281 --> 01:50:24.660
that the state post-conviction processes
permit you to make in other forums.

01:50:24.827 --> 01:50:28.664
Now certainly he would like to have
a much freer reign

01:50:28.873 --> 01:50:33.711
to go back to court
and bring in 17 years' worth of claims

01:50:33.919 --> 01:50:36.547
that have been made
and retry his case.

01:50:36.714 --> 01:50:40.051
Counselor, what harm is there in
allowing him to present the evidence

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:42.720
from the last 17 years?
I'm sorry?

01:50:42.928 --> 01:50:47.141
JUDGE 2: What harm is there to--? In
allowing him to present all evidence?

01:50:47.933 --> 01:50:50.436
RAUPP: The harm is in the
finality of a criminal judgment

01:50:50.645 --> 01:50:55.066
that is not demonstrated
to have any constitutional

01:50:55.274 --> 01:50:58.486
or procedural defect
and just to try it again. I mean...

01:50:58.694 --> 01:51:02.531
RIORDAN: We would submit that the court
is to consider the DNA evidence,

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:08.287
along with all other evidence,
whether or not admitted at the first trial.

01:51:08.496 --> 01:51:10.414
All simply means all.

01:51:11.666 --> 01:51:16.671
LORRI: I talked to him, actually,
right after the hearing.

01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:19.882
Guards came into his cell

01:51:20.091 --> 01:51:24.095
and took everything,
everything he owns. All of his books.

01:51:24.303 --> 01:51:28.307
BRAGA:
Fifty-one books, his journals, his shoes.

01:51:28.516 --> 01:51:30.351
When he asked
why they were doing that,

01:51:30.559 --> 01:51:33.562
they said they were sick
of seeing him on the news.

01:51:33.771 --> 01:51:37.817
It's terribly abusive.
They were horribly abusive to him.

01:51:39.610 --> 01:51:42.488
TERRY [OVER <i>PHONE]:
They don't like the death-row thing.</i>

01:51:42.697 --> 01:51:45.324
<i>They're trying to get Damien Echols
off of death row</i>

01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:47.326

two new people in there,</i>

01:51:47.493 --> 01:51:49.370
<i>and you know

01:51:49.537 --> 01:51:52.081
<i>Don't even say it.

CINDY:
I ain't never felt the need to have to

01:51:55.126 --> 01:51:58.587
try to defend somebody
in our family before,

01:51:58.754 --> 01:52:01.465
but now I feel like
my brother's getting a bad rap.

01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:03.592
Somebody's got to say something.

01:52:03.759 --> 01:52:08.639
He, obviously, is just gonna
keep letting it go and letting it go

01:52:08.848 --> 01:52:12.059
because he feels like he's had enough,
you know, and it's--

01:52:12.226 --> 01:52:13.894
Somebody needs to say something.

01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:16.480
If they're trying to put the blame
on someone,

01:52:16.647 --> 01:52:19.150
they need to dig deeper
and find that someone.

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:21.444

Blake Sisk.
GEISER: How old are you?

01:52:41.213 --> 01:52:43.257
Twenty years old.
Okay.

01:52:43.632 --> 01:52:46.010
The other day
we got a call on the tipline.

01:52:46.177 --> 01:52:49.722
This young man had been a friend
of Michael Hobbs Jr.,

01:52:49.889 --> 01:52:52.141
who is the nephew of Terry Hobbs.

01:52:52.349 --> 01:52:56.270
Michael Hobbs Jr. lives in a town
called Mountain Home, Arkansas.

01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:59.482
His dad, Michael Hobbs Sr.,
runs a restaurant there,

01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:02.193
and they've lived there
for a long time.

01:53:02.401 --> 01:53:06.322
First thing he told us was that
when he was about 12 or 13,

01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:09.575
he and Michael Hobbs Jr.
had been playing football in the yard.

01:53:09.784 --> 01:53:12.953
And when they got done playing football,
they came into the house,

01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.040
got a drink and were gonna
go to the basement to play pool.

01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:19.251
SISK: Michael said, you know,
that his uncle and dad

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:21.670
were in their downstairs basement,

01:53:21.879 --> 01:53:26.050
and we were gonna go downstairs,
but his dad hollered,

01:53:26.258 --> 01:53:29.386
you know, "Don't come down here,
we're busy talking."

01:53:29.595 --> 01:53:33.432
So me and Michael
decided to listen in.

01:53:33.641 --> 01:53:35.976
BRAGA:
Michael Hobbs Jr. told the witness

01:53:36.185 --> 01:53:39.188
that his dad was down there
with his uncle,

01:53:39.355 --> 01:53:42.274
sounding like
he might have been crying, saying:

01:53:42.441 --> 01:53:45.653
"I'm sorry for what happened
and I regret it."

01:53:45.861 --> 01:53:49.073
Michael's dad was just consoling him
about, you know, the situation

01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:52.368
and everything would be all right.
"You're not in any trouble."

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:54.578
A number of years later,
he and a friend

01:53:54.787 --> 01:53:59.208
were picked up by Michael Hobbs Jr.
in Michael Hobbs Jr.'s truck.

01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:02.503
My name's Cody Gott. This is fine.

01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:06.841
You can use this for whatever you need
to use it for. You have my permission.

01:54:07.007 --> 01:54:11.053
When he picked us up, it was like--
It wasn't the same Michael that I--

01:54:11.262 --> 01:54:14.056
You know what I mean? He wasn't...

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:17.309
Wasn't in the same mood
that he usually is.

01:54:17.518 --> 01:54:20.104
He's usually outgoing,
like, ready to go do something.

01:54:20.312 --> 01:54:22.940
Ready to talk, ready to--
And he was just real quiet.

01:54:23.148 --> 01:54:28.904
He wasn't as talkative, and I asked him
what was going on and he...

01:54:29.113 --> 01:54:30.447
"What's up, man?"

01:54:30.656 --> 01:54:33.659
And he said, he told me that:

01:54:33.868 --> 01:54:37.705
"My uncle Terry,
he killed those kids

01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:41.041
in that case,
in the West Memphis Three case."

01:54:41.250 --> 01:54:46.839
And then he was like, well, "My dad
told me that my uncle's the one

01:54:47.047 --> 01:54:51.385
who murdered those three kids and
it's been, you know, on my mind all day.

01:54:51.594 --> 01:54:54.013
It's been just running
through my head."

01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:58.392
And I was just in shock,
I didn't really know what to say.

01:54:58.601 --> 01:55:01.896
Then, according to Michael Hobbs Jr.,
the second witness says

01:55:02.104 --> 01:55:07.735
that his dad called this, quote,
"the Hobbs' family secret," close quote.

01:55:07.943 --> 01:55:10.696
SISK:
He said, "Only me, my dad, my uncle"

01:55:10.905 --> 01:55:13.115
and I think maybe his mom

01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:15.743
and someone else in the family
might have knew.

01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:18.037
It might have been the other brother.

01:55:18.203 --> 01:55:20.539
He called it the Hobbs' family secret,
and he said:

01:55:20.706 --> 01:55:23.918
"if they knew I told you,
I would be in deep crap."

01:55:24.126 --> 01:55:26.295
B RAGA: There was one third
friend that they thought

01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:30.466
might also have some information.
What this third witness told me:

01:55:30.633 --> 01:55:34.762
"Michael Hobbs Jr. and I and a third
friend were playing pool in the basement.

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:37.306
During the game,
the third friend said something

01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:39.808
about the West Memphis Three case."

01:55:40.017 --> 01:55:42.770
Then this young man,
the third witness, asked:

01:55:42.978 --> 01:55:44.939
"What's the
West Memphis Three case?"

01:55:45.147 --> 01:55:46.982
Might be the only teenager
in Arkansas

01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:49.860
who didn't know what
the West Memphis Three case was.

01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:52.196
He asked that question
and Michael Hobbs Jr.

01:55:52.363 --> 01:55:54.490
responded to him by saying, quote:

01:55:54.657 --> 01:55:58.035
"My uncle killed three kids
in West Memphis," close quote.

01:55:58.243 --> 01:56:00.913
And according to this third witness,
Michael Hobbs Jr.

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.166
was dead serious when he said this.
He was not fooling around.

01:56:06.752 --> 01:56:10.464
In addition to getting them to sign the
declarations under penalty of perjury,

01:56:10.673 --> 01:56:14.093
they all took polygraph examinations.

01:56:14.301 --> 01:56:17.137
The polygraph examiner concluded
that these three young men

01:56:17.346 --> 01:56:21.892
were absolutely telling the truth about
what they heard Michael Hobbs Jr. say.

01:56:22.059 --> 01:56:24.478
I don't even think Michael knows
why he did it.

01:56:24.645 --> 01:56:28.273
I just-- You know, he knows
it happened, he knows he did it.

01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:33.487
And it was his dad--
His dad is-- Probably would know,

01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:35.990
you know, why he did it.

01:56:36.198 --> 01:56:38.367
We don't have any power
as defense attorneys

01:56:38.575 --> 01:56:42.413
to call Michael Hobbs Sr. into my office
and to ask him to tell me

01:56:42.621 --> 01:56:45.624
whether he called this the
Hobbs' family secret and why he did.

01:56:45.833 --> 01:56:48.085
The prosecutor can issue
a grand jury subpoena

01:56:48.293 --> 01:56:50.546
and ask Michael Hobbs Sr.
In the grand jury

01:56:50.754 --> 01:56:55.092
where he's under penalty of perjury
if he lies, "Did you say this?

01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.803
Why'd you say it?
What did you mean?"

01:56:58.012 --> 01:57:00.222
And I think
that's the kind of information

01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:04.393
that only the prosecutor can get
that could really crack this wide open.

01:57:04.601 --> 01:57:07.396
<i>TERRY</i> [OVER <i>PHONE]: I don't give</i> a

01:57:24.329 --> 01:57:27.249

01:57:33.964 --> 01:57:37.259
PAM:
Was Terry capable? Did Terry do it?

01:57:37.468 --> 01:57:42.222
Did I stay with a man
that possibly murdered my child?

01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:47.436
And it does raise a lot of questions.

01:57:49.104 --> 01:57:51.106
[Hr]

01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:59.698
The court rejected every single thing
that the state argued.

01:57:59.865 --> 01:58:04.203
Basically saying Burnett was wrong in
not allowing a hearing based on the DNA.

01:58:04.411 --> 01:58:09.333
One, by one, by one.
Just no, no, no. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

01:58:09.917 --> 01:58:14.046
Finally the Supreme Court
has ruled in our favor.

01:58:14.213 --> 01:58:18.675
Uh, we could not be more excited.
It was unanimous.

01:58:18.884 --> 01:58:20.886
This is huge
for Arkansas.

01:58:21.095 --> 01:58:23.430
The Supreme Court is--
Has ruled in our favor.

01:58:23.639 --> 01:58:27.851
The State Supreme Court
is on our side.

Finally. We won. We won.

RIORDAN:
The wake of the victory was probably

01:59:18.402 --> 01:59:21.280
the most difficult
and frustrating time for Lorri of all.

01:59:21.446 --> 01:59:26.076
LORRI: "Dearest Lorri, you never, ever
need to apologize for how you are feeling.

01:59:26.243 --> 01:59:28.912
I totally understand what you said,
and why you said it,

01:59:29.121 --> 01:59:31.915
and I'm glad you felt
you could say it to me.

01:59:32.124 --> 01:59:34.376
This situation is so very hard.

01:59:34.585 --> 01:59:37.212
You and Damien
have been treading water for years

01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:40.007
and the shore never seems
to get any closer.

01:59:40.215 --> 01:59:42.050
It's no wonder you feel like giving up."

01:59:42.259 --> 01:59:45.888
After years and years of filing
and hear-- You know, this and that

01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:47.806
and never-ending bureaucracy,

01:59:48.015 --> 01:59:50.017
it keeps going back and forth.

01:59:50.225 --> 01:59:55.147
RIORDAN: To go 16 or 17 years and finally
have what was a remarkable victory,

01:59:55.355 --> 01:59:57.191
and not simply for the three,

01:59:57.399 --> 02:00:00.986
but about the whole nature
of DNA testing in Arkansas.

02:00:01.195 --> 02:00:05.490
And then say, "Well, when will this
actually lead to Damien being released?"

02:00:05.699 --> 02:00:07.951
And the answer being,
you know, who knows?

02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:11.496
LORRI: "it took me a while to understand
what you must have learned long ago.

02:00:11.705 --> 02:00:15.000
Nothing, and I mean nothing,
comes easily with this case.

02:00:15.209 --> 02:00:16.585
The breakthroughs are small

02:00:16.793 --> 02:00:19.421
and the obstacles never seem
to decrease in size.

02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:23.258
Any small piece of progress
is clawed from unforgiving rock.

02:00:23.467 --> 02:00:25.302
All we can do is keep going.

02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:29.640
If we keep on pounding on the wall,
it will break, because it must break.

02:00:29.848 --> 02:00:32.392
All things eventually break.

02:00:32.601 --> 02:00:36.230
I would love to see photos of the 1920s
house in Garton when you have them.

02:00:36.438 --> 02:00:37.648

Damien, you know, he's struggling

02:00:53.705 --> 02:00:58.126
because of the health issues
he's facing in prison,

02:00:58.335 --> 02:01:02.047

not being able to go into the sunlight.

02:01:19.147 --> 02:01:21.191
STIDHAM:
Sometimes it appears to me that

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:25.946
the attitude of the players involved
in this case are:

02:01:26.154 --> 02:01:29.074
"Let's sweep this under the rug,
let's hope it goes away."

02:01:29.283 --> 02:01:31.326
No one wants to admit
they made a mistake.

02:01:31.535 --> 02:01:35.956
What about the lawsuits
that are gonna follow?

02:01:36.164 --> 02:01:38.250
And who cares about that issue?

02:01:38.458 --> 02:01:42.087
Let's just do the right thing,
it's simple to do the right thing.

02:01:49.052 --> 02:01:52.973
BRAGA: Something we had always planned on
doing was to try to get the state to agree:

02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:56.018
"Let's just go right to the new trial,
because, of course,

02:01:56.184 --> 02:01:58.895
Damien and Jason and Jessie
are sitting in the cooler

02:01:59.062 --> 02:02:01.231
each time there's a delay.
Let's get to it."

02:02:01.398 --> 02:02:03.400
[Hr]

02:02:05.652 --> 02:02:08.155
JACKSON: So the defense decided
to approach the state and say:

02:02:08.363 --> 02:02:12.909
"Hey, let's skip the evidentiary hearing
and just go straight to a new trial."

02:02:14.161 --> 02:02:18.332
BRAGA: Two weeks ago yesterday, we
sent Patrick Benca, our local counsel,

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.336
in to have a lunch meeting with
Dustin McDaniel, the attorney general.

02:02:22.544 --> 02:02:26.089
BENCA: I've known Dustin from law school
and I knew he'd be approachable about it.

02:02:26.298 --> 02:02:29.134
I wasn't sure whether he would
take it in consideration.

02:02:29.343 --> 02:02:34.056
Matter of fact, during the lunch
he said to me, "That's a big ask."

02:02:34.222 --> 02:02:37.809
Um, but I felt that he was listening
to everything that I had to say.

02:02:38.769 --> 02:02:42.105
BRAGA: Much to our surprise, the
discussions progressed sort of away

02:02:42.314 --> 02:02:44.816
from the
"agree to the new trial" idea to

02:02:45.025 --> 02:02:48.904
is there a way to reach a practical
resolution of this case for everybody?

02:02:50.197 --> 02:02:51.948
The attorney general brought in

02:02:52.157 --> 02:02:54.910
Scott Ellington,
a circuit county prosecutor.

02:02:55.118 --> 02:02:57.454
He came to Little Rock
with a bunch of his lawyers.

02:02:57.621 --> 02:03:02.709
The defense attorneys have
maintained complete innocence

02:03:02.876 --> 02:03:05.545
on behalf of the defendants
all this time.

02:03:05.712 --> 02:03:09.925
I mean, I don't underestimate our ability
to have obtained convictions

02:03:10.133 --> 02:03:11.468
in these cases.

02:03:11.676 --> 02:03:15.305
But I wasn't looking forward
to having to go to trial in this case,

02:03:15.514 --> 02:03:20.894
because of the deterioration
of evidence.

02:03:21.103 --> 02:03:25.357
Memories lost.
You know, stories changed.

02:03:25.565 --> 02:03:28.985
Every time there was a filing,
you know, there was a DNA...

02:03:29.194 --> 02:03:32.406
Came out in the paper
that there's new DNA, new DNA.

02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:36.243
I was not looking forward to that.

02:03:37.536 --> 02:03:42.541
We didn't want to show weakness
in maintaining the judgment,

02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:48.296
so one of our positions was
the state is not making an offer.

02:03:48.505 --> 02:03:51.675
BRAGA: The state said they're guilty.
Our guys said they're innocent.

02:03:51.883 --> 02:03:53.593
How do you bridge those two gaps?

02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:55.762
There's only a couple
of options in between.

02:03:55.929 --> 02:03:57.305
We started making our pitches.

02:03:57.514 --> 02:03:59.808
We started making our pitch
for the Alford plea,

02:03:59.975 --> 02:04:01.893
which we talked about
before going in.

02:04:02.853 --> 02:04:07.190
BRAGA: It's not a perfect resolution.
It will be a guilty plea,

02:04:07.357 --> 02:04:10.277
but it's a very, very rare
and unique kind of guilty plea

02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:13.155
where you get to
maintain your innocence.

02:04:13.363 --> 02:04:15.449
Prosecutors hardly ever allow this,

02:04:15.657 --> 02:04:18.785
and judges have the right to say,
"We're not gonna accept it

02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:22.456
because can't maintain your innocence
and plead guilty at the same time."

02:04:22.664 --> 02:04:25.292
It kind of seems oxymoronic.

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:29.296
ELLINGTON: I'm-- I guess I'm kind of a
"shoot from the hip" guy to start with.

02:04:29.504 --> 02:04:33.508
I kind of jumped on it real quick
and then the attorney general and I

02:04:33.717 --> 02:04:37.053
visited just briefly and he was like:

02:04:37.262 --> 02:04:39.723
"Are you sure
that you want to agree to this?

02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:45.520
Are you sure this is the right thing
for you, politically?"

02:04:45.729 --> 02:04:48.482
Because he knows
I'm elected as a prosecutor.

02:04:48.690 --> 02:04:50.442
And this could backfire.

02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:54.821
BRAGA: We knew what we really needed to make
this deal, which is really only two points.

02:04:54.988 --> 02:04:56.364
We needed it to be a deal

02:04:56.531 --> 02:04:59.451
where the West Memphis Three
could maintain their innocence.

02:04:59.618 --> 02:05:03.413
And we needed it to be a deal where they
got out of prison the day it was entered.

02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:06.458
Not two years from now.
Not, "We'll consider you for parole."

02:05:06.625 --> 02:05:08.376
Not 10 years more.

02:05:08.585 --> 02:05:11.755

get out of jail.

the Craighead County Circuit Court.

02:05:19.304 --> 02:05:22.307

will take up certain matters

02:05:22.516 --> 02:05:25.185
pertaining to the West Memphis Three
case tomorrow.

02:05:25.393 --> 02:05:27.229
BRAGA:
It went to Damien first,

02:05:27.938 --> 02:05:30.148
and Damien readily accepted it.

02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:33.527

BRAGA: Then the deal went to Jessie.

Been a while.
It has been a while.

02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:37.989
BRAGA: And Jessie accepted it.
We're almost home.

02:05:38.198 --> 02:05:43.161
Which means by the time it got to Jason,
Jason had the full veto power.

02:05:43.328 --> 02:05:45.705
If he said yes,
the deal would work for everybody.

02:05:45.914 --> 02:05:49.793

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:11.601
And, I mean, really that's about

02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:16.940
the biggest illustration of his innocence
that you could ever imagine.

02:08:17.691 --> 02:08:19.526
But this was really coming to a head,

02:08:19.734 --> 02:08:24.072
and we didn't know how long
this offer was gonna be on the table.

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.491
And it was there for the taking.

02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:30.036
LORRI: We were trying to figure out
alternate ways to get in touch with him.

02:08:30.245 --> 02:08:33.581
Somebody who cares about him
and loves him needs to be talking to him.

02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:37.043
We need to get Holly.
It's busy.

02:08:38.044 --> 02:08:40.255
I'm just gonna keep dialing
over and over.

02:08:40.463 --> 02:08:43.091
You know, over the years
we've just grown to be...

02:08:43.299 --> 02:08:46.469
I mean, I'm closer to Jason Baldwin
than I am to many people

02:08:46.678 --> 02:08:49.097
that I have known my entire life.

02:08:49.305 --> 02:08:54.269
Everybody just cannot believe
that he would choose to stay in prison

02:08:54.436 --> 02:08:57.397
when he can walk out,
no matter what the reasons are.

02:08:59.149 --> 02:09:02.152
I got a call from Lorri.

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.738
She said, "I'm gonna ask
Eddie Vedder to call you."

02:09:05.822 --> 02:09:09.576
VEDDER: I was trying to explain to Jason,
look, anyone's gonna have to understand

02:09:09.784 --> 02:09:11.953
locally and globally,

02:09:12.162 --> 02:09:15.957
State of Arkansas is not gonna let go
of three convicted child murderers

02:09:17.167 --> 02:09:21.713
based on time served.
It's implied that they don't have enough.

02:09:21.921 --> 02:09:26.301
They don't have enough to keep them in.
They don't have enough to win a trial.

02:09:26.968 --> 02:09:30.972
HOLLY: I was able to get a call in to the
prison to have Jason give me a call.

02:09:31.181 --> 02:09:33.933
He said, "This isn't fair.

02:09:34.142 --> 02:09:36.561
I don't wanna concede
anything to the state."

02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:40.774
He did not wanna talk about it,
and he didn't call back.

02:09:40.982 --> 02:09:42.776
And I was devastated.

02:09:42.984 --> 02:09:46.988
VEDDER: I believed in his decision,
and I didn't wanna question it.

02:09:47.197 --> 02:09:52.035
I would never ask another man
to compromise his ideals.

02:09:52.243 --> 02:09:55.079
But it was so close to freedom.

02:09:55.288 --> 02:09:57.916
It was unbearable.

02:09:59.417 --> 02:10:01.419
Not hearing from him

02:10:01.628 --> 02:10:06.800
and not knowing what he was thinking
was unbearable.

02:10:10.553 --> 02:10:13.181
LEVERITT:
Jason Baldwin is 16 years old.

02:10:13.389 --> 02:10:15.225
He's been in jail for months.

02:10:15.391 --> 02:10:16.976
And he's about to enter a trial

02:10:17.143 --> 02:10:19.979
where prosecutors are going to ask
for the death sentence.

02:10:20.188 --> 02:10:22.190
He's offered two deals in secret

02:10:22.398 --> 02:10:26.236
if he would testify
that Echols had done the killing.

02:10:27.028 --> 02:10:30.240
He tells the prosecutors,
"No, that would be a lie.

02:10:30.448 --> 02:10:33.201
My mother raised me
better than that."

02:10:33.409 --> 02:10:37.038
The 16-year-old refused,
not once, but twice.

02:10:37.247 --> 02:10:40.750
HOLLY: At 16 years old, it
never even crossed his mind

02:10:40.959 --> 02:10:45.171
to throw somebody
under the bus to save his own skin.

02:10:46.047 --> 02:10:48.466
So Monday night,
I get this call from him.

02:10:48.675 --> 02:10:51.261
He says, "Neither option is really fair."

02:10:51.427 --> 02:10:54.973
I said to him, "if you wanted to do
something you didn't feel right about,

02:10:55.139 --> 02:10:57.767
you could have done that
18 years ago and gone free."

02:10:57.934 --> 02:11:00.478
And he said,
"Yeah, but the difference is, this time

02:11:00.645 --> 02:11:03.231
I can set Damien free
by my decision."

02:11:04.274 --> 02:11:08.695
I mean, that was his best friend,
you know.

02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:16.077
This deal sucks,
but we want their freedom.

of course, we will continue...

Spend a lot of time trying to explain it.
They had a private, closed-door hearing...

02:11:50.236 --> 02:11:53.865
LASER: Mr. Echols, how do you
wish to plead in this case?

02:11:54.073 --> 02:11:56.826
Your Honor,
I am innocent of these charges,

02:11:57.035 --> 02:12:01.664
but I'm entering an Alford guilty plea
today based on advice of my council.

02:12:01.873 --> 02:12:04.751
And my understanding
that it's in my best interest to do so

02:12:04.918 --> 02:12:06.753
given the entire record of the case.

02:12:06.961 --> 02:12:10.381
LASER: Same as relates to you, Mr. Misskelley.
How do you wish to plead?

02:12:10.590 --> 02:12:15.595
I am pleading guilty under North Carolina
<i>v.</i> Alford in the Arkansas rules.

02:12:15.803 --> 02:12:18.222
Although I am innocent.

02:12:19.933 --> 02:12:23.519
This is--
And this plea is in my best interest.

02:12:24.562 --> 02:12:28.191
Everybody just be patient.
We're waiting too, like everyone else.

02:12:28.399 --> 02:12:30.693
Just gotta stay in place.

02:12:30.902 --> 02:12:35.281

choose to plead in this case?

[CHATTERING]

02:12:38.618 --> 02:12:41.621

I am innocent of murdering

02:12:41.829 --> 02:12:44.666
Christopher Byers,
Michael Moore and Steven Branch.

02:12:44.874 --> 02:12:49.087
However, after serving 18 years
in the penitentiary for such,

02:12:49.295 --> 02:12:52.924
I agree that it's in the state's
best interest, as well as my own,

02:12:53.132 --> 02:12:55.969
that based upon
North Carolina v. Alford

02:12:56.177 --> 02:13:00.181
that I plead guilty
for first-degree murder for those crimes.

02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:01.599
LASER:
All right.

02:13:01.808 --> 02:13:05.395
The court finds that
there is a factual basis for the plea,

02:13:05.603 --> 02:13:11.567
that the pleas are voluntary and will be
accepted and received by the court.

02:13:12.986 --> 02:13:15.863
I'm aware of the controversy
that's existed.

02:13:16.072 --> 02:13:18.866
I'm aware of the involvement
of the people in this case.

02:13:19.075 --> 02:13:23.746
I don't think it'll make the pain go away
to the victims' families.

02:13:24.831 --> 02:13:30.253
I don't think it will take away a minute
of the 18 years

02:13:30.461 --> 02:13:32.964
that these three young men served

02:13:33.131 --> 02:13:36.467

What I've just described
is tragedy on all sides.

02:13:41.681 --> 02:13:45.893
And I commend people in the case
that have assisted towards the end

02:13:46.102 --> 02:13:50.314

to the best that we can do.

The tremendous judge.

02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:57.739
Um... He didn't have to say the things
that he did at the end.

02:15:07.517 --> 02:15:11.312
and that's the case at the end of
every trial, and this one is no different.

02:15:11.521 --> 02:15:14.857
First of all, I understand
that nobody in that room

02:15:15.066 --> 02:15:19.445
wanted to hear from me, particularly.

02:15:19.654 --> 02:15:23.116
I needed to be heard by my voters,

02:15:23.324 --> 02:15:25.868
and I needed to offer
some explanation.

02:15:26.077 --> 02:15:27.870
I'll tell you, let me tell you this.

02:15:28.079 --> 02:15:31.124
This judge was most likely
going to grant a new trial.

As far as gathering up evidence,
I hadn't gotten there yet.

I've not reviewed reams and reams
and volumes and boxes and boxes,

02:15:38.005 --> 02:15:41.217
but the evidence I've seen,
I believe these guys are guilty.

02:15:41.425 --> 02:15:42.844
I know they pled guilty.

02:15:43.052 --> 02:15:44.887
With their entry of a plea of guilty,

02:15:45.096 --> 02:15:49.976

02:19:40.164 --> 02:19:45.920
than it is for me because I've never had
a really solid foundation in my life.

02:19:46.128 --> 02:19:50.132
When I was young, we were constantly
on the move, constantly on the go.

02:19:50.341 --> 02:19:54.553
We never had a place that
we called home for long periods of time.

02:19:54.762 --> 02:19:58.224
"Time to vamp up your wardrobe.
Fall is coming."

02:19:58.432 --> 02:20:00.726
Yeah, we're gonna have
a early Halloween party

02:20:00.935 --> 02:20:03.145
since we're gonna be gone
for October.

02:20:03.354 --> 02:20:05.773
We're gonna do it
at the end of September.

02:20:06.941 --> 02:20:10.653
Our time together now
is more gentle in a way.

02:20:10.861 --> 02:20:13.781
What do you think about that stuff?
That fake spiderweb stuff?

02:20:13.989 --> 02:20:15.032
I love it.

02:20:15.241 --> 02:20:16.617
Think we should get it?
Yeah.

02:20:16.826 --> 02:20:19.328
DAMIEN: When you're in prison
you get three hours a week,

02:20:19.537 --> 02:20:21.997
so you feel very desperate
and rushed.

02:20:22.206 --> 02:20:25.835
Like you're trying to wring
every second out of it that you can.

02:20:26.669 --> 02:20:31.298
And it's like being out here
and being together 24 hours a day,

02:20:31.507 --> 02:20:36.470
you just feel like you're able to relax
into each other a little more.

02:20:37.096 --> 02:20:39.473
LORRI: There's a bit of grief.
You leave people you love.

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:41.851
You don't know when
you're gonna see them again.

02:20:42.059 --> 02:20:44.019
If you can ever go back
to that place.

02:20:44.228 --> 02:20:47.523
Because we don't plan
on going back to Arkansas.

02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:51.569
DAMIEN:
I don't look at the political aspirations,

02:20:51.777 --> 02:20:54.989
the greed, the evil,
the cruelty or anything else.

02:20:55.197 --> 02:20:59.034
Because for me, it's over.
For me, I'm ready to move on.

02:21:00.411 --> 02:21:03.706
LORRI: When you first asked me about the
letters, I got them out of storage,

02:21:03.914 --> 02:21:06.292
and it felt so foreign to me.

02:21:07.751 --> 02:21:09.044
Thank you. You too.

02:21:09.253 --> 02:21:11.464
LORRI: So then we talked
about burning them all.

02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:14.216
We thought the best thing to do
is take all the letters.

02:21:14.383 --> 02:21:17.261
Just burn them, so they never--
No one will ever read them.

02:21:17.470 --> 02:21:19.680
There's so many things,
it's so personal.

02:21:19.847 --> 02:21:22.600
I happened to pull one out
that was about six months

02:21:22.766 --> 02:21:26.437
into when we were writing to each other
and I thought, "That's not so bad."

02:21:27.813 --> 02:21:31.692
And there are elements of it that
remind me of how we talk today, so...

02:21:32.735 --> 02:21:35.738
"My dearest Lorri,
I love the letter I got from you today,

02:21:35.946 --> 02:21:37.531
the one about us changing.

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:41.285
You were right,
we should be looking forward, not back.

02:21:44.288 --> 02:21:46.499
You give me the strength
to face anything,

02:21:46.707 --> 02:21:49.502
but I also know
that not everyone is like you.

02:21:49.710 --> 02:21:54.548
If they were-- If they were,
then everyone would be in love."

02:21:55.007 --> 02:21:59.887
Right, well. "I love the way
<i>Master</i> and Margarita ends.

02:22:00.095 --> 02:22:03.057
The way they get to spend
eternity together, alone.

02:22:03.265 --> 02:22:06.018
That they are granted peace."

02:22:06.227 --> 02:22:09.563
DAMIEN: "And you are left to wonder
what adventures they'll have next."

and I, just saying goodbye to everyone

02:22:25.079 --> 02:22:27.581
and beginning our own journey

02:22:28.541 --> 02:22:32.503
to places that neither of us
have ever known before."
