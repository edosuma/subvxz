<i>What you're
looking at here</i>

01:11.032 --> 01:15.435
<i>is that most peculiar
of places, Groovingham.</i>

01:15.437 --> 01:19.372
<i>If you can't imagine it,
well, it's probably here too.</i>

01:19.374 --> 01:22.710
<i>It's a world populated
by all kinds of...</i>

01:22.712 --> 01:25.915
<i>Look, it's probably better if
you just see it for yourself.</i>

01:29.050 --> 01:31.020
<i>I'm sure he's fine.</i>

01:37.593 --> 01:38.925
See you later, suckers!

01:38.927 --> 01:41.595
Get him! He's getting away!

01:41.597 --> 01:44.497
<i>This is where
our story starts,</i>

01:44.499 --> 01:46.065
<i>the "Once Upon a Time."</i>

01:46.067 --> 01:48.935
<i>And a young wizard
was arriving in Groovingham</i>

01:48.937 --> 01:50.974
<i>with his true love, Mary.</i>

01:52.841 --> 01:53.843
Ah!

01:55.443 --> 01:57.713
Here comes the Grin!
Here comes the Grin!

02:03.918 --> 02:05.387
Mwah!

02:06.921 --> 02:07.923
Bye!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.533
Oh, here comes the Grin!

02:21.169 --> 02:22.935
Here comes the Grin!

02:22.937 --> 02:24.404
Here comes the Grin!

02:24.406 --> 02:26.039
Here comes the Grin!

02:26.041 --> 02:28.075
Here comes the Grin!

02:28.077 --> 02:29.610
Here comes the Grin!

02:29.612 --> 02:30.778
Here comes the Grin!

02:30.780 --> 02:31.979
Here comes the Grin!

02:31.981 --> 02:33.814
Here comes the Grin!

02:33.816 --> 02:35.982
Time to faint. Ooh!

02:35.984 --> 02:38.785
<i>He was top of
his class at wizard school,</i>

02:38.787 --> 02:41.722
<i>so of course
everyone wanted to see him</i>

02:41.724 --> 02:45.024
<i>on his very first day
as king's wizard.</i>

02:45.026 --> 02:47.461
The greatest wizard
in the world!

02:47.463 --> 02:50.029
A hero to us boys and girls!

02:50.031 --> 02:51.868
A new taxpayer!

02:53.803 --> 02:58.038
<i>But of everyone,
the Grin was the most excited.</i>

03:05.680 --> 03:06.916
Here comes the Grin.

03:10.786 --> 03:15.158
<i>Finally, he was going
to make his dream come true.</i>

03:17.959 --> 03:22.161
<i>He would make everybody
and everything...</i>

03:22.163 --> 03:23.700
<i>happy.</i>

03:33.075 --> 03:35.708
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

03:35.710 --> 03:37.810
He's got the grin!

03:37.812 --> 03:41.014
And there's plenty
to go around!

03:41.016 --> 03:42.484
I want the grin!

03:43.986 --> 03:45.986
<i>♪ Come on, grin ♪</i>

03:45.988 --> 03:47.220
<i>♪ Hang your coats ♪</i>

03:47.222 --> 03:49.122
<i>♪ Eat our chips, come on ♪</i>

03:49.124 --> 03:50.824
<i>♪ He's gotta know ♪</i>

03:50.826 --> 03:53.059
<i>♪ Shake your coconuts ♪</i>

03:53.061 --> 03:54.994
I want the grin!

03:54.996 --> 03:57.064
- I want the grin!
- I want the grin!

03:57.066 --> 03:58.668
I want the grin!

04:20.522 --> 04:21.724
Wait!

04:41.175 --> 04:43.277
Reporting for work,
Your Highness.

04:43.279 --> 04:47.147
I've made a good start already.
If you look outside, it's...

04:47.149 --> 04:50.920
Total chaos, Sire!
The realm's aflame!

05:08.236 --> 05:11.572
Hello. Does anyone fancy
some tax refunds?

05:11.574 --> 05:13.076
All it takes is a "please."

05:14.810 --> 05:16.577
- Please?
- Close enough.

05:16.579 --> 05:20.147
Whoo-hoo! Not only am I happy,
I'm also rich!

05:20.149 --> 05:21.815
Mmmph!

05:21.817 --> 05:24.750
This... is...

05:24.752 --> 05:27.020
chaos!

05:27.022 --> 05:31.995
Chaos isn't so vile
if you face it with a smile!

05:36.899 --> 05:38.965
Capture him!

05:38.967 --> 05:40.536
Help!

05:54.950 --> 05:55.952
Mwah!

06:04.259 --> 06:05.228
Jump!

06:09.365 --> 06:10.934
Ohh!

06:13.199 --> 06:13.802
Whoa!

06:16.904 --> 06:18.106
Get in.

06:20.709 --> 06:21.711
Take the pepper!

06:25.813 --> 06:27.115
Ah-choo!

06:28.149 --> 06:29.318
Ah-choo!

06:39.661 --> 06:42.729
<i>They spent days
hidden amongst the caves.</i>

06:42.731 --> 06:45.998
I totally understand
you want to make everyone happy,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.767
but you can't force it.

06:47.769 --> 06:50.436
I'm just trying
to cheer everyone up,

06:50.438 --> 06:52.272
whether they like it or not.

06:52.274 --> 06:55.241
People have to find happiness
themselves.

06:55.243 --> 06:57.679
You don't understand.

07:04.887 --> 07:05.954
Oh!

07:09.724 --> 07:10.792
Look!

07:20.401 --> 07:21.904
Ah-choo!

07:25.707 --> 07:27.809
I'll get some supplies.

07:31.779 --> 07:34.313
Don't worry.

07:34.315 --> 07:36.782
I'll make this little fella
happy too.

07:36.784 --> 07:39.318
You'll see.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.024
We'll talk later, okay?

07:46.829 --> 07:48.995
<i>But she never
came back.</i>

07:55.971 --> 07:58.871
<i>The king accused her
of helping the Grin</i>

07:58.873 --> 08:01.710
<i>and banished her forever.</i>

08:10.051 --> 08:13.152
<i>She was sent through a portal
to our dimension,</i>

08:13.154 --> 08:15.991
<i>never to see her love again.</i>

08:34.942 --> 08:38.178
Nooo!

08:38.179 --> 08:42.049
<i>And she could never
return to her world.</i>

09:02.805 --> 09:05.041
She's not coming back, Dingo.

09:11.012 --> 09:12.982
She's left me.

09:17.219 --> 09:21.188
Grandma, I wish they stayed
happily ever after.

09:21.190 --> 09:25.324
Oh, me too, Terry.
It would have been wonderful.

09:25.326 --> 09:27.327
Why didn't you write it
that way?

09:27.329 --> 09:29.095
Well, in real life,

09:29.097 --> 09:32.401
things don't always turn out
happily ever after.

09:36.972 --> 09:39.539
Grandma, what happened
to the Grin?

09:39.541 --> 09:44.010
I'm sure he's still the cheerful
fellow he always was.

09:44.012 --> 09:47.983
Now go to sleep.
Quickly, chop-chop.

09:57.392 --> 09:59.192
She's left me.

11:43.431 --> 11:44.597
Ah...

11:44.599 --> 11:45.901
choo!

12:34.583 --> 12:36.118
Wait!

12:43.791 --> 12:45.792
Whoa!

12:45.794 --> 12:47.964
Whoa!

12:58.773 --> 13:02.274
Try opening your eyes this time.
Chop-chop!

13:02.276 --> 13:03.345
Chop-chop!

13:28.402 --> 13:30.270
What do you mean,
you don't have change?

13:30.272 --> 13:32.572
I'm sorry.
We had one customer today,

13:32.574 --> 13:34.140
and he paid with a twenty.

13:34.142 --> 13:36.108
Daddy, why couldn't we
go somewhere

13:36.110 --> 13:37.409
with a real roller coaster?

13:37.411 --> 13:39.145
Hey!

13:39.147 --> 13:42.283
We've got a real classic
roller coaster right here!

13:49.690 --> 13:53.125
Oh, come on, darling.
This place!

13:53.127 --> 13:56.261
Didn't want to come here anyway.
Three hours in the car!

13:56.263 --> 13:58.533
Yeah, kid.
This place is a dump.

14:04.705 --> 14:07.308
And your ice cream sucks!

14:12.446 --> 14:16.582
Look, I know you already have
your hands full,

14:16.584 --> 14:19.619
but we need to think
about updating.

14:19.621 --> 14:23.823
Amusement parks are,
well, more amusing these days.

14:23.825 --> 14:26.326
And exciting.

14:26.328 --> 14:29.662
What? The park is exciting.
Really exciting.

14:29.664 --> 14:31.597
It's just the way
Grandma left it.

14:31.599 --> 14:34.333
You can't always keep things
exactly as they were

14:34.335 --> 14:36.302
in your grandma's day.

14:36.304 --> 14:37.770
Oh, lovely!

14:37.772 --> 14:39.438
Hey, put that down!

14:39.440 --> 14:42.207
That was Grandma's
last-ever cup of coffee!

14:42.209 --> 14:46.312
And she left it
in this exact spot.

14:54.756 --> 14:57.222
I know this is hard,

14:57.224 --> 15:01.593
but if we miss another payment,
we'll have to close.

15:01.595 --> 15:03.765
We can't close!

15:12.607 --> 15:15.808
Oh, Terry, you either
need to move forward here

15:15.810 --> 15:18.510
or go back home
to your parents.

15:18.512 --> 15:21.649
It's time to face reality.

15:40.234 --> 15:41.934
Hmm.

15:41.936 --> 15:43.803
What? Strange.

15:43.805 --> 15:44.772
Oh.

15:55.717 --> 15:57.786
Oh, come on! Chop-chop!

16:00.589 --> 16:01.556
Huh?

16:25.980 --> 16:27.579
Huh? What is this?

16:27.581 --> 16:31.719
Okay, I just need to land
this thing gently.

16:36.523 --> 16:37.792
Good enough.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.861
What? A dragon!

16:41.863 --> 16:45.497
That was a living,
breathing dragon!

16:49.637 --> 16:53.405
And it wrote me
a speeding ticket.

16:53.407 --> 16:54.906
Huh?

16:54.908 --> 16:57.577
A castle?

16:57.579 --> 16:59.678
And a chocolate mine.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.781
It's just like Grandma's park,
only realer.

17:02.783 --> 17:05.550
And don't forget
the candy frost cemetery.

17:05.551 --> 17:07.786
Oh, thank you.

17:07.788 --> 17:08.990
Heh heh heh.

17:12.326 --> 17:15.627
I say! What a nice young man!

17:15.630 --> 17:19.031
Okay, that's it.

17:19.034 --> 17:20.669
I've got to get back home
immediately.

17:42.824 --> 17:45.393
Oh, dreadful weather!

17:50.597 --> 17:52.564
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

17:52.566 --> 17:54.566
Sweet freedom!

17:54.568 --> 17:55.603
Ow!

18:02.943 --> 18:04.509
Where's the boss?

18:04.511 --> 18:05.878
You've lost him!

18:05.880 --> 18:08.747
He doesn't need us anymore.

18:08.749 --> 18:10.783
He's abandoned us!

18:11.920 --> 18:13.486
Don't be absurd.

18:13.488 --> 18:15.755
Who would ever abandon me?

18:15.757 --> 18:16.956
Finally!

18:16.958 --> 18:18.957
After decades!

18:18.959 --> 18:22.794
The king will feel
all the might of my revenge.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.700
What?
"In loving memory?"

18:28.702 --> 18:32.607
How dare he kick the bucket
without telling me!

18:34.875 --> 18:36.676
Boss, where are you?

18:36.678 --> 18:38.511
You've squished him!

18:41.815 --> 18:45.653
The king is dead.
Bang goes my revenge.

18:48.155 --> 18:50.656
Princess Dawn's coronation.

18:50.658 --> 18:53.659
Huh? Princess?
As in the king's daughter?

18:53.661 --> 18:55.695
I don't know, Boss.

18:55.697 --> 18:58.030
Of course she is,
you halfwit.

18:58.032 --> 19:00.401
Where is my dragon? Dingo!

19:05.073 --> 19:08.908
Stop. Your breath.

19:08.910 --> 19:10.909
All right, that's enough!

19:10.911 --> 19:15.814
Dingo, Grumpies,
we have work to do.

19:15.816 --> 19:18.450
Ooh! But first,
I need a bath and a shave.

19:18.452 --> 19:20.820
We're going to a coronation!

19:37.705 --> 19:39.671
Sound the alarm!

19:51.585 --> 19:53.619
It's a beautiful day
here in Groovingham,

19:53.621 --> 19:55.621
and everyone is
anxiously waiting

19:55.623 --> 19:58.760
for Princess Dawn
to appear for her coronation.

20:07.669 --> 20:11.070
But I don't even know if I want
to be queen just by myself.

20:11.072 --> 20:13.538
Truth be told,
I think I'd rather sit here

20:13.540 --> 20:15.640
and wait for my Prince Charming
to come.

20:15.642 --> 20:17.543
You have come of age.

20:17.545 --> 20:21.581
It is mandatory that you succeed
your father on the throne.

20:21.583 --> 20:26.218
Plus look at
the pretty crown, dear.

20:26.220 --> 20:29.956
Oh, my little girl...

20:29.958 --> 20:34.060
now a full-grown woman!

20:34.062 --> 20:35.761
Blow your nose, darling.

20:35.763 --> 20:38.230
But I don't want
to do any of this!

20:45.806 --> 20:48.174
What is it, Bip?

20:48.176 --> 20:51.110
Grump escape from big prison.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.578
Grump coming!

20:52.580 --> 20:54.213
The Grump?

20:54.215 --> 20:57.582
I thought he was just
a boogeyman in old stories,

20:57.584 --> 20:59.651
told to make me eat my soup.

20:59.653 --> 21:02.121
You never wanted
to finish your soup.

21:02.123 --> 21:05.157
Actually, he is very real,
I'm afraid.

21:05.159 --> 21:07.860
And the last wizard
in Groovingham.

21:07.862 --> 21:09.562
Oh, my!

21:09.564 --> 21:12.797
It took your father
so many years to capture him.

21:15.269 --> 21:17.102
Here comes the Grump.

21:17.104 --> 21:19.671
Here comes the Grump.

21:19.673 --> 21:21.774
Here comes the Grump.

21:21.776 --> 21:23.543
Here comes the Grump.

21:31.619 --> 21:35.254
It's going get grumpy in here!

21:54.275 --> 21:56.342
Who is it?

21:56.344 --> 21:59.844
Wizard Grump,
you are not welcome.

21:59.846 --> 22:01.147
Please go!

22:01.149 --> 22:03.015
Oh, really?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.850
Hmm.

22:04.852 --> 22:09.220
Now, I've heard that that
inconsiderate king of yours

22:09.222 --> 22:14.726
died before I could say
my special goodbye to him.

22:14.728 --> 22:17.295
Good to know he left
his daughter

22:17.297 --> 22:19.732
to pay for
his selfish actions.

22:20.934 --> 22:25.137
I once offered happiness
to this kingdom,

22:25.139 --> 22:27.305
but you rejected it!

22:27.307 --> 22:29.909
So I'm the Grump now,

22:29.911 --> 22:31.744
and I want to show you
my gratitude

22:31.746 --> 22:34.380
by giving you gloom!

22:40.654 --> 22:41.923
Oh, Bip!

22:45.660 --> 22:46.995
Whoo-hoo!

22:48.296 --> 22:51.764
Cut the racket,
you dumb buffoon.

22:51.766 --> 22:56.305
Get down, get funky
on my spell of gloom!

23:17.825 --> 23:19.291
Princess not safe.

23:19.293 --> 23:21.427
Me take to magic panic room.

23:21.429 --> 23:22.698
What?

23:31.072 --> 23:33.272
Oh, not again.

23:33.274 --> 23:35.209
This is the third time
I've landed here.

23:36.744 --> 23:40.916
This is insane.
I just want to go home!

23:49.056 --> 23:52.661
Why won't you work?
What am I doing differently?

24:06.039 --> 24:09.041
Oh, my dear child,
cover your ears

24:09.043 --> 24:12.844
and sing 500 times
the lullaby of the little sun.

24:12.846 --> 24:16.948
Nanny, do you know what an evil
spell over my kingdom means?

24:16.950 --> 24:18.350
Don't say it.

24:18.352 --> 24:21.086
My prince is coming to save me!

24:21.088 --> 24:22.854
Would this be
a bad time to say

24:22.856 --> 24:26.358
I may have oversold
the whole prince thing?

24:26.360 --> 24:29.762
Come out!
Come out wherever you are!

24:29.764 --> 24:32.898
Just in case the prince
is late for some reason,

24:32.900 --> 24:35.237
remember to go to the Oracle.

24:36.269 --> 24:38.204
♪ Oh, it is sunny ♪

24:38.206 --> 24:40.773
♪ And it puts warmth
in my tummy ♪

24:40.775 --> 24:43.042
♪ When that big fat
yellow ball ♪

24:43.044 --> 24:45.747
♪ Makes my troubles,
oh, so small ♪

24:58.159 --> 25:00.962
Hey, little
detachable thing.

25:02.028 --> 25:03.829
Oh, sorry, chum.

25:03.831 --> 25:05.801
I can't come with you.

25:09.103 --> 25:10.936
You!

25:10.938 --> 25:13.304
Wait! Give me that back!

25:13.306 --> 25:14.473
Wait!

25:25.952 --> 25:28.486
Listen to the misery, Dingo.

25:28.488 --> 25:31.857
Oh, is it not beautiful?

25:31.859 --> 25:33.926
Inspiring, hmm?

25:35.162 --> 25:38.330
Unhappy makes me happy!

25:38.332 --> 25:39.465
Boss! Boss!

25:39.467 --> 25:42.467
Oh, bad news, Boss!

25:42.469 --> 25:44.303
The Princess escaped the gloom!

25:44.305 --> 25:46.037
Hah!

25:46.039 --> 25:51.479
That little thorn in my side
must be plucked out!

25:53.146 --> 25:56.181
But the good news is
we know where she is.

25:56.183 --> 25:59.884
Well, why didn't you
say it, hmm?

26:04.124 --> 26:07.094
Hey, stop! I need that thing
to get back home!

26:12.566 --> 26:14.166
Get back here!

26:14.168 --> 26:16.901
Stop. Nobody goes in.

26:16.903 --> 26:20.272
How come you never speak to me
that nicely?

26:28.548 --> 26:30.349
Sorry.

26:41.595 --> 26:42.861
Hey, you!

26:42.863 --> 26:44.431
Give me that!

26:48.369 --> 26:51.603
Mmm. Delicious.

26:51.605 --> 26:54.206
Hey, come back!

26:54.208 --> 26:57.344
Tweet, tweet, blooming tweet.

27:02.115 --> 27:05.217
Hey, would you like any help
crossing the street?

27:10.892 --> 27:12.957
Thank you very much.

27:12.959 --> 27:14.259
My pleasure.

27:17.632 --> 27:20.232
Welcome to Groovingham!
Have a nice day!

27:20.234 --> 27:23.002
Welcome to Groovingham!
Have a nice day!

27:23.004 --> 27:24.535
At least someone here
is happy.

27:24.537 --> 27:27.474
I hate my work and my life!

27:28.976 --> 27:31.409
Hey, come back here,
nose thing!

27:32.513 --> 27:33.849
Hey!

27:41.055 --> 27:42.921
Stop!

27:42.923 --> 27:45.125
Give that back!

28:27.168 --> 28:28.566
Greetings!

28:28.568 --> 28:31.303
I was wondering,
how will my prince find me

28:31.305 --> 28:33.104
when I'm hiding down there?

28:33.106 --> 28:35.306
Should I not be lying
upon the bed?

28:36.710 --> 28:38.076
Bip!

28:38.078 --> 28:41.015
Hey, get back here!

28:49.422 --> 28:52.591
You're here!

28:54.362 --> 28:56.531
I'm falling!

28:58.399 --> 28:59.598
Who are you?

28:59.600 --> 29:00.666
I'm Dawn.

29:00.668 --> 29:02.400
I'm your princess,

29:02.402 --> 29:06.304
and we'll be living
happily ever after together.

29:06.306 --> 29:08.573
- And you are?
- Uh, Terry.

29:08.575 --> 29:10.441
Prince Terry!

29:10.443 --> 29:14.446
No, just Terry-Terry.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.483
Oh.

29:26.693 --> 29:29.794
Listen, I need to get back home.

29:29.796 --> 29:33.465
But you can't leave.
We... We need you.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.367
You are a prince,
aren't you, Terry-Terry?

29:35.369 --> 29:36.567
I'm not.

29:36.569 --> 29:38.269
- Say you are.
- But I'm not.

29:38.271 --> 29:39.705
Please say you are!

29:39.707 --> 29:41.806
Okay. I'm a prince.

29:41.808 --> 29:43.542
I knew it!

29:43.544 --> 29:45.576
Excuse me, can you help me?

29:45.578 --> 29:48.313
- Also not a prince.
- Let's just say...

29:48.315 --> 29:50.649
there comes a time
in the life of every princess

29:50.651 --> 29:53.252
when she faces a great crisis.

29:53.254 --> 29:56.388
A sleeping spell
or in this precise instance,

29:56.390 --> 29:58.623
a spell of gloom.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.324
And when that time comes,

30:00.326 --> 30:04.563
her prince will come
to her rescue.

30:04.565 --> 30:06.265
Who told you this?

30:06.267 --> 30:09.400
- My teddy bear.
- Your teddy bear said this?

30:09.402 --> 30:11.503
It's a bit more like
she sings to me,

30:11.505 --> 30:13.471
sweet airs and lullabies.

30:13.473 --> 30:15.541
But yes, basically that's it.

30:15.543 --> 30:18.310
Come! We must find
Chancellor Woodblock!

30:18.312 --> 30:20.348
Yeah, Chancellor Woodblock,
obviously.

30:44.738 --> 30:48.474
Didn't you see the sign,
you bozo?

30:48.476 --> 30:53.211
Ohh! Guess I'd better
slide down the wall.

30:54.882 --> 30:56.180
Whoo!

30:56.182 --> 30:57.649
So how come you're not gloomy?

30:57.651 --> 30:59.418
I hid under the bed.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.687
Whenever there is a crisis,
that is what one does.

31:01.689 --> 31:06.124
Um, so would my royal
princeness-ness carry weight

31:06.126 --> 31:08.459
on someone, say, assisting me
on going back home?

31:08.461 --> 31:10.361
- Of course it would.
- Awesome.

31:10.363 --> 31:12.630
As soon as you
save my kingdom,

31:12.632 --> 31:14.733
<i>and</i> we get married.

31:14.735 --> 31:16.701
Uh, married?

31:16.703 --> 31:20.205
What is this, Vegas?

31:20.207 --> 31:21.739
Look!

31:21.741 --> 31:25.209
My faithful subjects
safe and sound.

31:25.211 --> 31:27.178
Hmmph!

31:27.180 --> 31:29.247
Chancellor Woodblock?
Nanny?

31:29.249 --> 31:31.717
Don't "Chancellor Woodblock"
and "Nanny" us!

31:31.719 --> 31:34.352
We can't bear you anymore.

31:34.354 --> 31:37.823
That's funny
because you are a bear,

31:37.825 --> 31:40.661
and you said "bear" you.

31:42.863 --> 31:45.496
- Okay.
- They've all been gloomed.

31:45.498 --> 31:48.300
It's not that.
You treat us like servants!

31:48.302 --> 31:51.203
Have you all taken leave
of your senses?

31:51.205 --> 31:53.272
You <i>are</i> my servants.

31:53.274 --> 31:56.207
- Oh, how dare she!
- Don't push it, my girl!

31:56.209 --> 31:57.743
Come on, you Grumpies!

31:57.745 --> 32:01.679
Pull! Pull!

32:01.681 --> 32:05.350
Wait, wait, I know that guy.
That's the Grin, isn't it?

32:05.352 --> 32:07.886
That was his name, but after
things went bad for him,

32:07.888 --> 32:09.720
he changed it to the Grump.

32:09.722 --> 32:11.355
Much more classy.

32:11.357 --> 32:14.860
But why? Hmm.

32:14.862 --> 32:17.896
Okay, listen, Princess,
I need to find my way back home.

32:17.898 --> 32:20.332
That's right!
Chancellor Woodblock told me

32:20.334 --> 32:21.832
to go to the Oracle.

32:21.834 --> 32:24.402
You can come with me.
He'll know what to do.

32:24.404 --> 32:26.971
Oh, so you were
listening after all.

32:26.973 --> 32:29.774
Okay, how do we get there?
Do you have a map?

32:29.776 --> 32:31.944
I think we have a map room.

32:31.946 --> 32:34.446
You'll have to remind me
where that is.

32:34.448 --> 32:37.282
- It's a rather large castle.
- I don't know.

32:37.284 --> 32:39.584
- Chancellor, please!
- Sorry.

32:39.586 --> 32:42.853
Apparently I've completely
taken leave of my senses.

32:42.855 --> 32:45.457
So no one will help me?

32:45.459 --> 32:48.226
Fine! I'm resourceful,
am I not?

32:48.228 --> 32:50.829
You're good at doing things
for yourself.

32:50.831 --> 32:54.565
Oh, so that's
what "resourceful" means.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.400
Then no, I'm not.

32:56.402 --> 32:58.336
Come on, we've got
to get out of here.

32:58.338 --> 33:01.005
These people are crazy.

33:01.007 --> 33:04.508
Careful,
you good-for-nothing twerp.

33:04.510 --> 33:07.281
A dragon is a delicate thing.

33:12.753 --> 33:14.556
Dingo.

33:21.862 --> 33:23.928
Okay, attack. Fan out.
Let's move.

33:23.930 --> 33:26.267
Move, move, move, move!

33:27.735 --> 33:29.834
So where is that map room?

33:29.836 --> 33:33.738
One needs a map to find
the map room in this place.

33:35.342 --> 33:38.580
This is the carousel room.

33:40.881 --> 33:42.650
A plastic balls room?

33:46.319 --> 33:48.388
Howling wind room.

33:52.526 --> 33:53.628
Get them!

33:55.028 --> 33:56.861
Is this customary
in your kingdom?

33:56.863 --> 33:59.797
Well, one needs evildoers
to be rescued from.

33:59.799 --> 34:03.067
Now do your thing,
brave prince.

34:03.069 --> 34:04.738
Okay. Run!

34:19.687 --> 34:21.688
Whee!

34:26.326 --> 34:27.826
Clapping monkey room?

34:27.828 --> 34:30.629
Why do you even have
a clapping monkey room, baby?

34:30.630 --> 34:32.964
It is a truth
universally acknowledged

34:32.966 --> 34:37.402
that every house is in need
of a clapping monkey room.

34:37.404 --> 34:40.538
Or else, where would one put
one's clapping monkeys?

34:40.540 --> 34:42.674
- I knew that.
- Look!

34:42.676 --> 34:44.475
Mm-hmm. Nice, huh?

34:44.476 --> 34:47.346
No! I mean the mood dart.

34:47.348 --> 34:50.382
What does this one do?

34:50.384 --> 34:52.350
Well, it didn't do anything
to me, babe.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.051
Now move aside

34:54.053 --> 34:56.355
while I use
my out-of-this-world strength

34:56.357 --> 34:57.388
to protect you.

34:57.390 --> 34:59.491
Oh, no.

34:59.493 --> 35:01.525
It's an ego dart.

35:01.527 --> 35:03.661
You've been very self-important.

35:03.663 --> 35:07.301
Well, I think you'll find myself
is very important.

35:12.705 --> 35:16.611
Sorry, shorties,
your mood darts don't affect me.

35:17.643 --> 35:19.611
Oops! Sorry.

35:19.613 --> 35:21.748
No, it's fine.
It didn't hurt.

35:33.026 --> 35:36.096
Hey, no touching
the merchandise, baby.

35:44.772 --> 35:47.839
How do I look in this dress?

35:47.841 --> 35:50.908
Oh no. Don't tell me there's
an insecure-girlfriend dart.

35:50.910 --> 35:53.545
Hold on.
I didn't know we had

35:53.547 --> 35:57.748
a male-chauvinist-pig dart.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.152
Nope. That's just you.

36:30.651 --> 36:32.451
When are you going
to stop running

36:32.453 --> 36:35.687
and start fighting
those things?

36:35.689 --> 36:39.223
Me? It's you they're after.

36:39.225 --> 36:40.660
Hang on.

36:45.064 --> 36:47.132
Blame darts.
I knew it.

36:47.134 --> 36:50.972
Oh, sure.
Of course you know everything.

36:56.810 --> 36:59.810
Oh. The map room.

36:59.812 --> 37:01.047
Where?

37:02.815 --> 37:04.618
Oh.

37:08.855 --> 37:11.522
Hello there.
What can I do for you?

37:11.524 --> 37:13.658
We're looking for
a map to the Oracle.

37:13.660 --> 37:17.161
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm only a map
for finding the map room.

37:17.163 --> 37:20.031
But we're already
in the map room.

37:20.033 --> 37:22.734
Then my work here is done.

37:22.736 --> 37:24.603
Uh, thank you?

37:24.605 --> 37:27.105
♪ I'm the map, I'm the map,
I'm the map ♪

37:27.107 --> 37:29.643
Oh, definitely not that one.

37:39.118 --> 37:41.888
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey!

37:48.861 --> 37:50.761
Oh!

37:52.232 --> 37:54.134
Yeah. Nothing.

37:58.672 --> 37:59.874
Aaargh!

38:01.841 --> 38:03.176
Aww!

38:17.790 --> 38:20.324
All right, guvnors,
how can I help ya?

38:20.326 --> 38:22.696
Didn't hear ya there,
me ol' China Plate.

38:24.297 --> 38:27.031
"China Plate" means "mate."

38:27.033 --> 38:28.333
Don't tell me
you ain't never heard

38:28.335 --> 38:31.036
no Cockney-rhyming slang before.

38:31.038 --> 38:34.105
I don't Adam and Eve it.

38:34.107 --> 38:37.241
Here comes the Grump!

38:37.243 --> 38:40.045
Run! Come on!

38:40.047 --> 38:43.114
Move, fools!
Search for them!

38:43.116 --> 38:44.248
Ah, it's him.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.120
The Grin...
I mean the Grump.

38:48.855 --> 38:50.654
Pssst. Help me.

38:50.656 --> 38:52.324
Now!

38:54.027 --> 38:55.296
Push!

39:03.937 --> 39:05.038
Oh.

39:15.649 --> 39:16.817
Run!

39:19.652 --> 39:21.786
Look out, mates!
Unlike the darts,

39:21.788 --> 39:24.989
a spell cast from a wizard
will be permanent.

39:24.991 --> 39:26.924
Permanent?
Is there another way out?

39:26.926 --> 39:28.292
Yeah, hang on,
give me a second.

39:30.397 --> 39:33.364
Please pull up your vehicle.

39:33.366 --> 39:35.033
The heck with it!

39:35.035 --> 39:37.736
Just dive through
that door on the ground!

39:37.738 --> 39:39.774
Hmm? What the...

39:48.881 --> 39:50.750
After you.

39:56.723 --> 39:58.757
Stop shooting!

39:58.759 --> 40:01.161
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop it!

40:15.007 --> 40:16.775
Right, let's get out of here.

40:16.777 --> 40:18.842
Okay, where ya headed,
me ol' chinas?

40:18.844 --> 40:21.679
Well, we still need
the right map.

40:21.681 --> 40:24.015
A map?

40:24.017 --> 40:25.716
I'm a top-of-the-range,

40:25.718 --> 40:28.420
state-of-the-art
navigation assistant.

40:28.422 --> 40:30.888
GP Sparrow's the name.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.857
GPS for short.

40:32.859 --> 40:36.694
Good for you, but can you
take us to the Oracle?

40:36.696 --> 40:39.230
Yes, little lady.
I'm your man. This way.

40:39.232 --> 40:42.100
Dawn must go!

40:42.102 --> 40:46.203
There is no need to be rude.
I haven't started to rule yet.

40:46.205 --> 40:48.440
It's a spell. It'll get worse
and worse every day.

40:48.442 --> 40:51.341
- Worse? How?
- We don't want a princess.

40:51.343 --> 40:52.777
Go away.

40:52.779 --> 40:54.949
Much worse than a tomato.

41:03.957 --> 41:06.091
My blimp will get us
to the Oracle faster.

41:06.093 --> 41:08.893
The sooner we get there,
the sooner I'll be back home.

41:08.895 --> 41:11.995
But you can't leave
after that.

41:11.997 --> 41:13.397
Who will protect me?

41:13.399 --> 41:17.368
I'm sorry. I have
responsibilities, a job.

41:17.370 --> 41:19.870
And seriously, Dawn,
do I look like a prince?

41:19.872 --> 41:23.109
You certainly don't
smell like one.

41:24.176 --> 41:25.375
Ah-choo!

41:25.377 --> 41:27.344
Can you stop that?

41:27.346 --> 41:30.415
I've got to go home and save
my grandma's amusement park.

41:30.417 --> 41:34.018
Amusement park?
Does it tell jokes?

41:34.020 --> 41:37.388
No, although the profits
are pretty laughable.

41:42.228 --> 41:45.763
And if it's that bad,
why would you want to go back?

41:45.765 --> 41:47.464
It's not that it's bad.

41:47.466 --> 41:50.400
I haven't found a way to make it
as cool as my grandma made it.

41:50.402 --> 41:51.404
Come on.

41:53.973 --> 41:56.174
And he's a family man too.

41:56.176 --> 41:58.344
Everyone, hop in.

42:31.277 --> 42:33.881
You have arrived
at your destination.

42:38.484 --> 42:40.988
Uh, where?

42:42.321 --> 42:44.054
The Oracle.

42:44.056 --> 42:45.426
Ta-da!

42:47.259 --> 42:50.027
And we're gonna ask
this Oracle questions,

42:50.029 --> 42:51.830
and it's going
to answer us, right?

42:51.832 --> 42:53.063
Right.

42:53.065 --> 42:57.067
Greetings! We're here!
Oracle!

42:57.069 --> 43:00.170
Uh-huh, sure, whatever.
I mean, you know, fine.

43:21.160 --> 43:22.128
Wow.

43:25.332 --> 43:29.266
Thou have reached
the all-seeing Oracle!

43:29.268 --> 43:33.337
Name your business with me,
puny mortals.

43:33.339 --> 43:36.908
Oh! You tell me.
You are the Oracle.

43:36.910 --> 43:38.542
Oh, come on,
we need a little drama here.

43:38.544 --> 43:41.478
It's kind of getting boring,
sitting around all day.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.649
You have come
in search of my help!

43:44.651 --> 43:48.118
Talk about a cut-priced Oracle.
Anyone could have guessed that.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.453
Anyone could
have guessed that!

43:49.455 --> 43:52.190
Well, how about
I know the Grump

43:52.192 --> 43:54.591
has cast a spell
over your kingdom.

43:54.593 --> 43:56.326
Ah, big deal.

43:56.328 --> 44:00.598
I also know that thing
with your underwear, Terry.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.134
- What thing with his...
- Nothing! It was an accident!

44:03.136 --> 44:05.103
Never mind.
Guy's awesome! He even...

44:05.105 --> 44:06.603
Guessed my name.

44:06.605 --> 44:09.207
Who's a cut-price Oracle
now, huh?

44:09.209 --> 44:10.975
Wow! I take it back.
That's...

44:10.977 --> 44:12.976
Amazing!
I can't believe...

44:12.978 --> 44:15.647
- How dumb I look now?
- Wait. No, I wasn't going...

44:15.649 --> 44:19.350
To say that. Stop it.
No, you stop it.

44:19.352 --> 44:21.085
Gentlemen, settle down.

44:21.087 --> 44:22.654
Sorry, my dear.

44:22.656 --> 44:26.391
You must travel to the Cave
of the Whispering Orchids.

44:26.393 --> 44:29.127
I didn't know of such a place.

44:29.129 --> 44:32.964
And that, Princess,
is why I'm the all-knowing one.

44:32.966 --> 44:35.132
Find the Crystal Key.

44:35.134 --> 44:38.236
It is the only way
to lift the spell.

44:38.238 --> 44:40.138
So she needs to find the key.

44:40.140 --> 44:41.371
Yeah, so do you.

44:41.373 --> 44:44.341
You need that key
to go back home.

44:44.343 --> 44:46.009
Oh, goodie!

44:46.011 --> 44:48.513
We're both on a quest
for the same thing.

44:48.515 --> 44:51.683
We have much in common,
key buddy.

44:51.685 --> 44:54.284
How can the key be the thing
that helps both of us?

44:54.286 --> 44:58.989
Because that key is the key...

44:58.991 --> 45:00.958
to happiness.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.592
- But...
- Well!

45:02.594 --> 45:05.062
Now we all know
what we're looking for.

45:05.064 --> 45:10.067
Of course, when I find the key,
I'm going to destroy it.

45:10.069 --> 45:11.372
Sorry.

45:13.707 --> 45:16.507
Get her!
And the boyfriend too.

45:16.509 --> 45:18.576
I'm not her boyfriend.

45:18.578 --> 45:21.078
That's what everyone says
at the beginning.

45:22.247 --> 45:25.049
Oh, that was a wink, by the way.

45:25.051 --> 45:26.583
She'll leave you, you know.

45:26.585 --> 45:28.518
Not in a million lifetimes.

45:28.520 --> 45:31.024
Fry them, Dingo.

45:34.259 --> 45:35.560
Stone the crows!

45:35.562 --> 45:37.995
What, you couldn't
see that coming?

45:37.997 --> 45:39.663
I told you,
I get bored a lot.

45:39.665 --> 45:41.265
Run!

45:41.267 --> 45:43.303
At last, a bit of excitement.

45:54.247 --> 45:56.313
Quick, give me
the vial of perfume.

45:56.315 --> 45:58.049
Good idea, my prince.

45:58.051 --> 46:01.319
At least we'll be
sweet-smelling corpses.

46:01.321 --> 46:02.489
Run!

46:05.357 --> 46:07.060
Help me!

46:15.502 --> 46:16.634
Hey!

46:16.636 --> 46:18.639
Whoa!

46:25.578 --> 46:29.149
That zeppelin.
Where did he get my blimp?

46:51.236 --> 46:52.405
Ah... Ah...

46:59.779 --> 47:04.114
Don't do it. Don't do it.
Hold that sneeze, lizard lips!

47:04.116 --> 47:05.151
Ah-choo!

47:39.419 --> 47:41.118
We just need to patch it.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.687
I don't suppose
you have any rubber trees.

47:42.689 --> 47:44.888
No, but I do know
the closest drum.

47:44.890 --> 47:48.359
That's drum and bass place
for a patch.

47:48.361 --> 47:51.728
- The Balloony Woonie Kingdom.
- What's that?

47:51.730 --> 47:54.132
A kingdom inhabited by balloons.

47:54.134 --> 47:55.732
I bet there's a patch there.

47:55.734 --> 47:57.902
- On we go then, gentlemen.
- Uh, detour.

47:57.904 --> 47:59.636
Recalculating, recalculating.

47:59.638 --> 48:03.207
But first, I decree
we make a small camp.

48:03.209 --> 48:04.808
If one does not rest soon,

48:04.810 --> 48:07.712
it might ruin
the royal complexion.

48:07.714 --> 48:09.746
Yeah, I do feel a bit drowsy.

48:09.748 --> 48:11.616
I didn't bring
my special sleeping pillow.

48:11.618 --> 48:12.853
I'll have to improvise.

48:24.663 --> 48:29.199
Now, Prince Terry,
it's time for my bedtime story.

48:29.201 --> 48:30.768
You may begin.

48:30.770 --> 48:32.737
Really? I don't think so.

48:35.942 --> 48:40.277
Okay, okay. Uh...

48:40.279 --> 48:42.312
Once upon a time,
there was a...

48:42.314 --> 48:45.949
- A prince?
- No, a... a lemur.

48:45.951 --> 48:48.419
- A lemur prince?
- No, just a lemur.

48:48.421 --> 48:51.422
And this lemur, well,
he lived with his granny lemur

48:51.424 --> 48:53.491
in the kingdom of Real-worldia.

48:53.493 --> 48:55.259
Is she beautiful?

48:55.261 --> 48:58.696
Yeah, yeah, the most
beautiful granny ever.

48:58.698 --> 49:00.630
And she had built
this incredible place,

49:00.632 --> 49:03.868
where kids... lemurs...
would have tons of fun.

49:03.870 --> 49:05.303
And she told her grandson

49:05.305 --> 49:07.437
stories about
this world of yours.

49:07.439 --> 49:09.406
And the lemur
and his granny lived...

49:09.408 --> 49:12.712
Lived happily ever after.

49:16.216 --> 49:18.649
I hate to burst
your princess bubble, but...

49:18.651 --> 49:22.353
"happily ever after" doesn't
really exist in reality.

49:22.355 --> 49:23.920
In Real-worldia?

49:23.922 --> 49:26.259
Not in Real-worldia,
nor in life.

49:28.294 --> 49:30.928
Life doesn't have happy endings.

49:30.930 --> 49:34.832
Life is full of happy endings,
Prince Terry.

49:34.834 --> 49:37.770
You just need to know
where to look for them.

49:53.453 --> 49:57.288
Your destination
is 300 feet ahead.

49:57.290 --> 49:59.890
My grandma told me
stories about this kingdom.

49:59.892 --> 50:03.294
Brave red balloons
defend the castle,

50:03.296 --> 50:08.366
using spears, shields,
swords, and...

50:08.368 --> 50:10.000
musical instruments?

50:10.002 --> 50:13.004
Go tell your king
that Princess Dawn is here

50:13.006 --> 50:14.705
and wishes to speak to him.

50:14.707 --> 50:17.308
No. There's no kings here,
sister.

50:17.310 --> 50:20.710
Kings are like so mainstream,
sister dude.

50:20.712 --> 50:22.913
Go ahead, everyone's welcome.

50:22.915 --> 50:24.882
Oh. Very well then.

50:24.884 --> 50:27.554
Announce our arrival,
if you please.

50:44.469 --> 50:46.370
Her Most Gracious Highness,

50:46.372 --> 50:50.440
Princess Dawn and her...

50:50.442 --> 50:52.743
buffoon have arrived.

50:52.745 --> 50:54.612
What?

51:17.536 --> 51:20.770
What have they done
to the castle? It's a cafe.

51:20.772 --> 51:23.774
Hello, I'm Thelonius!
What are you having today, man?

51:23.776 --> 51:26.944
We have oxygen, water,
oxygen-oxygen macchiato,

51:26.946 --> 51:29.346
fat-free deoxygenated oxygen.

51:29.348 --> 51:31.515
May I suggest
the air of the month?

51:31.517 --> 51:33.417
Thank you.
We really don't want any...

51:33.419 --> 51:35.118
What sizes do you serve?

51:35.120 --> 51:38.455
There's molto grandotto,
enormissimo,

51:38.457 --> 51:39.690
and big.

51:39.692 --> 51:40.924
Which is the small one?

51:40.926 --> 51:42.493
No small here.

51:42.495 --> 51:44.527
Just molto grandotto.

51:44.529 --> 51:46.464
Actually, we're not having
anything, thank you.

51:46.466 --> 51:48.565
We're in a bit of a hurry.

51:48.567 --> 51:50.000
Hurrying is wrong, man.

51:50.002 --> 51:52.670
Slow down.

51:52.672 --> 51:53.971
Take a sip.

51:53.973 --> 51:56.140
Love the ironic outfit, mate.

51:56.142 --> 51:59.944
Look, we're in a really critical
situation, right, Princess?

51:59.946 --> 52:01.511
Princess?

52:04.549 --> 52:08.018
No more Princess Dawn.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.888
Call me Princess Up.

52:10.890 --> 52:12.890
What have you given her?

52:12.892 --> 52:15.458
Since she's royalty,
I've added two complementary

52:15.460 --> 52:18.094
extra caffeinated oxygen shots
to her serving.

52:18.096 --> 52:19.797
Aha! Can I have some?

52:19.799 --> 52:22.966
No, you can't.
She is completely looney.

52:22.968 --> 52:24.567
We call it happiccino.

52:24.569 --> 52:28.071
Hey! Beep. Beep. Bip.

52:28.073 --> 52:31.007
Aah! Who's in charge here?

52:31.009 --> 52:33.647
We're all masters
of our own destiny here.

52:37.616 --> 52:39.716
Hey!

52:39.718 --> 52:42.719
Listen, we just need to find
a patch and get out of here.

52:42.721 --> 52:45.054
I've just had a lot
of some handmade patches

52:45.056 --> 52:48.591
from an indigenous organic
patch farm delivered.

52:48.593 --> 52:50.428
GP, please!

52:50.430 --> 52:52.663
What? I was doing nothing.

52:53.966 --> 52:57.067
Here comes the Grump!
What do we do?

52:57.069 --> 52:58.601
He found us.

53:01.540 --> 53:03.473
I love organic food.

53:03.475 --> 53:05.208
Battle stations, everyone!

53:05.210 --> 53:06.580
Ho!

53:09.047 --> 53:11.047
What are you...
What are you doing?

53:11.049 --> 53:14.120
We'll crush them under the might
of our nonconformist posts.

53:40.145 --> 53:44.515
What in the name of wickedness
are those guys doing, huh?

53:44.517 --> 53:46.083
Oh, no!

53:46.085 --> 53:49.053
They're posting horrible
comments about you, sir.

53:49.055 --> 53:51.054
Our popularity will be crushed.

53:51.056 --> 53:53.690
How dare they.

53:53.692 --> 53:55.493
I'll show them.

53:55.495 --> 53:57.797
Fire at will!

54:16.815 --> 54:19.752
Increase the sourness
of your comments.

54:21.053 --> 54:23.723
Feel the wrath of our weapon!

54:28.527 --> 54:29.826
Look out!

54:31.163 --> 54:32.799
I hate the poop one.

54:37.035 --> 54:38.134
Look out!

54:38.136 --> 54:40.105
YOLO!

54:41.306 --> 54:42.475
Really?

54:43.975 --> 54:47.480
You can use that old machine
to patch your blimp.

54:48.781 --> 54:51.047
Come on.
Let's help them first.

54:57.656 --> 54:58.792
Patch.

55:02.895 --> 55:04.995
Air.

55:08.600 --> 55:09.632
Give me that.

55:09.634 --> 55:10.803
Clear.

55:16.207 --> 55:18.007
Patch the wounded!

55:18.009 --> 55:19.245
Get them, Dingo!

55:22.214 --> 55:23.250
Hold it!

55:29.120 --> 55:30.687
Ohh! Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

55:30.689 --> 55:32.790
Everyone,
grab a tank and charge!

55:32.792 --> 55:34.160
Chop-chop!

55:38.864 --> 55:41.265
No!

55:41.267 --> 55:43.270
Not our season blend!

55:46.339 --> 55:49.707
There goes my prince,
saving me again.

55:49.709 --> 55:52.076
I'm so proud.

55:52.078 --> 55:55.145
Everyone, give me a T.

55:55.147 --> 55:57.647
- Uh...
- T!

55:57.649 --> 55:59.248
Be still,
so I can fry you.

Oh, this really is

56:43.962 --> 56:45.295
How long can you
hold them off?

56:45.297 --> 56:46.797
No worries, man, look.

56:50.069 --> 56:51.669
Thanks for all your help.

56:51.671 --> 56:54.871
Special happiccino order
for Mr. GP Sparrow.

56:54.873 --> 56:58.107
Uh, must be some other
GP Sparrow, I guess.

57:08.754 --> 57:10.754
Wave that smile bye-bye

57:10.756 --> 57:13.957
'cause this spell
will make you cry!

57:16.928 --> 57:21.832
Give me my blimp back!

57:25.337 --> 57:27.004
His blimp back? What?

57:27.006 --> 57:28.105
Princess!

57:31.944 --> 57:34.814
She's been struck by the spell.

57:35.915 --> 57:37.915
Are you okay?

57:39.250 --> 57:42.185
You will leave me.
You will.

57:42.187 --> 57:45.054
- Oh, woe is me.
- What?

57:45.056 --> 57:47.324
You will find
a younger princess

57:47.326 --> 57:49.893
with bigger diamonds
in her crown

57:49.895 --> 57:53.230
and more drama!

57:53.232 --> 57:56.333
We need specialist's help.
She's losing it.

57:56.335 --> 57:59.803
Searching. Found one alchemist
in the area.

57:59.805 --> 58:01.270
Head towards the...

58:01.272 --> 58:03.005
- Oh, no.
- What?

58:03.007 --> 58:06.042
The only way to get there
is incredibly dangerous,

58:06.044 --> 58:08.112
through the Christmas Tree
Forest.

58:08.114 --> 58:11.080
Let's go. We have no time.
She's about to get worse.

58:11.082 --> 58:14.787
Worse is good.
Happy is for conformists.

58:31.002 --> 58:33.770
Nice weather, eh, Princess?

58:36.942 --> 58:39.243
Quiet. They might hear ya.

58:39.245 --> 58:40.714
Who?

58:50.055 --> 58:53.190
Recalculating detour.

58:53.192 --> 58:55.391
Princess! Bip!

58:57.395 --> 58:58.895
Are you okay?

58:58.897 --> 59:01.565
Bip! Come here, boy! Bip!

59:01.567 --> 59:05.502
My pretty little puppy,
lost forever.

59:05.504 --> 59:08.337
No, if he were lost,
he wouldn't be barking.

59:08.339 --> 59:11.275
Uh, he's not barking anymore.

59:11.277 --> 59:12.378
Bip!

59:15.948 --> 59:16.915
Hello?

59:19.585 --> 59:23.520
And Yuletide greetings
to one and all.

59:36.301 --> 59:38.335
Oh, no.

59:38.337 --> 59:40.603
Is it that time of year
already?

59:40.605 --> 59:44.308
Here is always the most
wonderful time of the year.

59:44.310 --> 59:48.411
And you are all invited to spend
Christmas with us forever.

59:50.015 --> 59:54.150
Thank you very much,
but we can't stay.

59:54.152 --> 59:55.319
We're on a mission.

59:55.321 --> 59:57.221
Such a shame.

59:57.223 --> 01:00:01.991
Looks like you're going to be
part of our Christmas ornaments,

01:00:01.993 --> 01:00:04.560
just like your friends here.

01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:06.462
Grump?

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.935
Princess,
on the count of three,

01:00:12.937 --> 01:00:14.504
try swinging, okay?

01:00:14.506 --> 01:00:17.875
One, two...

01:00:17.877 --> 01:00:19.245
three.

01:00:25.216 --> 01:00:27.016
What are they doing to him?

01:00:27.018 --> 01:00:29.455
Some kind of
pastry arrangement?

01:00:30.955 --> 01:00:32.321
Oh, no!

01:00:32.323 --> 01:00:34.558
I think it's figgy pudding.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.893
We've got to stop them.

01:00:35.895 --> 01:00:37.393
No, wait!

01:00:37.395 --> 01:00:41.163
Finally! Our Christmas quest
has come to an end.

01:00:41.165 --> 01:00:43.065
Quest? Christmas quest?

01:00:43.067 --> 01:00:44.433
Yes! Don't you see?

01:00:44.435 --> 01:00:46.271
That's old Saint Nick
with his elves.

01:00:47.906 --> 01:00:49.505
Is it? Really?

01:00:49.507 --> 01:00:54.411
We are brave kids
on a quest to, uh...

01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:56.179
Give Rudolph his nose back.

01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:58.080
Give Rudolph
his nose back. Exactly.

01:00:58.082 --> 01:00:59.315
And save Christmas.

01:00:59.317 --> 01:01:02.286
Bip, give Rudolph
his nose back.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.190
That sounds convincingly similar
to a Christmas TV special.

01:01:07.192 --> 01:01:11.194
Release them fast!
They have to save Christmas!

01:01:11.196 --> 01:01:12.529
How did we miss it?

01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:14.998
That guy came flying in
with his pointy hat,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.533
his purple outfit, his...

01:01:16.535 --> 01:01:19.703

Ah-choo!

01:02:29.774 --> 01:02:32.542
- Well done, Bip!
- Keep going to the south.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:35.614
After eight miles, you will have
reached the alchemist.

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:49.025
I left my purse
back at the castle,

01:02:49.027 --> 01:02:51.127
and I want new shoes.

01:02:54.299 --> 01:02:57.333
You have arrived
at your final destination.

01:02:57.335 --> 01:03:00.006
You mean at death?

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:18.455
Yeah, I'm processing all this,

01:03:18.457 --> 01:03:22.558
and it feels like she's
suffering from being... sad.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.261
She's sad?
That's your diagnosis, is it?

01:03:25.263 --> 01:03:26.529
She's sad?

01:03:26.531 --> 01:03:29.665
My official diagnosis is
she's very sad.

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:32.768
Oh, no! I'm very sad.

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:37.174
And a little insipid too,
I might add.

01:03:37.176 --> 01:03:40.643
And I'm insipid too!

01:03:40.645 --> 01:03:44.281
Well, that's all
I can diagnose right now.

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:48.350
Mrs. Milverton, please offer
our guests some, uh...

01:03:48.352 --> 01:03:50.620
tea.

01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:53.355
- Is this how you do psychology?
- It's alchemy.

01:03:53.357 --> 01:03:56.259
Psychology
ain't an exact science.

01:03:56.261 --> 01:03:58.297
Alchemy is.

01:04:00.098 --> 01:04:04.234
Yes, no, well, that certainly
looks precise, I guess.

01:04:04.236 --> 01:04:06.303
Yes, I know
what needs to be done.

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:08.237
I need a hug.

01:04:09.808 --> 01:04:11.808
Okay.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.246
Come here, you.

01:04:14.279 --> 01:04:16.645
You need to find a wizard.

01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:19.116
Only a wizard
can remove a magic spell.

01:04:19.118 --> 01:04:21.487
But Grump is the only wizard
left, isn't he?

01:04:22.888 --> 01:04:24.056
Oh.

01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:30.192
Of course, there is the age-old,

01:04:30.194 --> 01:04:33.496
ever-reliable
true love's first kiss.

01:04:33.498 --> 01:04:38.467
Well, then I'm doomed
because nobody loves me.

01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:39.669
Nobody!

01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.770
Oh, no, don't say that.

01:04:41.772 --> 01:04:43.542
Bip loves you.

01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:46.342
Isn't there another way?

01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:47.511
It's either a wizard

01:04:47.513 --> 01:04:50.279
or the you-know-what, tiger.

01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:52.549
- Grrrr!
- What? No! No!

01:04:52.551 --> 01:04:54.551
You don't understand.

01:04:54.553 --> 01:04:56.486
I'm not in love
with the princess.

01:04:56.488 --> 01:04:57.853
I heard that.

01:04:57.855 --> 01:05:00.390
Why don't you give it a shot?
Go on.

01:05:00.392 --> 01:05:03.562
But this is nonsense.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:07.464
So a true love's first kiss
it is.

01:05:07.466 --> 01:05:09.766
It should be administered
as the sun rises

01:05:09.768 --> 01:05:11.667
and not a minute later.

01:05:11.669 --> 01:05:12.935
Call me in the morning.

01:05:12.937 --> 01:05:16.575
Here. Told ya.
Alchemy is the best.

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:27.516
- Dawn.
- Yes, Terry-Terry?

01:05:27.518 --> 01:05:29.752
No, I mean, it's dawn already.

01:05:29.754 --> 01:05:32.188
The kiss, remember?

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:34.727
Oh, the kiss.

01:05:46.471 --> 01:05:48.304
Oh, okay,
just give me a second here.

01:05:48.306 --> 01:05:50.207
You want directions
to her lips?

01:05:50.209 --> 01:05:51.440
I know where they are.

01:05:51.442 --> 01:05:53.210
Hurry up then, guvnor.

01:05:53.212 --> 01:05:55.679
Dawn's not gonna last forever
and neither is Dawn.

01:05:55.681 --> 01:05:58.317
Give us some room then.
Chop-chop.

01:06:22.406 --> 01:06:24.306
That was...

01:06:24.308 --> 01:06:26.408
amazing!

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.379
It was?

01:06:31.382 --> 01:06:33.750
I'm cured.

01:06:33.752 --> 01:06:36.953
But somehow I thought...

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:41.725
a true love's first kiss
would be more epic.

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:43.525
Whoa! What do you mean?

01:06:43.527 --> 01:06:45.761
It's almost as if...

01:06:45.763 --> 01:06:48.565
and I know it's probably
not possible...

01:06:48.567 --> 01:06:51.900
but "happily ever after"
doesn't happen

01:06:51.902 --> 01:06:54.370
just because of a kiss.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:59.942
Well, happily ever after
doesn't depend on just a kiss.

01:06:59.944 --> 01:07:01.511
And to be honest,

01:07:01.513 --> 01:07:03.946
I don't know how my kiss
broke your spell

01:07:03.948 --> 01:07:05.882
because, well, I'm...

01:07:05.884 --> 01:07:08.518
You're not in love with me.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.687
Please! We've only known
each other for a day.

01:07:11.689 --> 01:07:13.723
People don't fall in love
in a day.

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:16.558
It's just, well,
relationships are hard.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.627
They take work.

01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:23.866
I don't understand why you can't
believe in "happily ever after,"

01:07:23.868 --> 01:07:26.969
and why I'm so hard
to fall in love with.

01:07:26.971 --> 01:07:29.471
Oh, don't say that, Dawn.

01:07:29.473 --> 01:07:31.074
Hey, don't be mad at me.

01:07:31.076 --> 01:07:33.643
All I wanted was
to get back home.

01:07:33.645 --> 01:07:35.344
Then so be it!

01:07:35.346 --> 01:07:37.413
But...

01:07:37.415 --> 01:07:42.419
I'll sit here and perhaps
my true prince will come.

01:07:42.421 --> 01:07:44.890
Dismissed, all of you.

01:08:20.658 --> 01:08:22.928
You've reached
your destination.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:54.423
Well, it is a cave,
and I do hear whispers.

01:08:54.425 --> 01:08:58.330
Stop. Only wizards
are allowed inside our cave.

01:08:59.697 --> 01:09:02.399
Only wizards
are allowed inside our cave.

01:09:02.401 --> 01:09:06.002
Only wizards
are allowed inside our cave.

01:09:13.478 --> 01:09:16.645
I swear, if they ever
get to that cave...

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.417
Get him!

01:09:20.419 --> 01:09:22.551
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:28.057
- Put 'em up, put 'em up!
- Ah, ah, ah...

01:09:28.059 --> 01:09:30.029
Ah-choo!

01:09:41.005 --> 01:09:42.738
This spell is a sleepy jinx.

01:09:42.741 --> 01:09:45.411
Close your eyes
to get 40 winks.

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.058
Let us go and get that key.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:05.229
The princess can wait.

01:10:09.099 --> 01:10:11.903
Oh, don't worry, lad.
I'll find ya.

01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:23.245
Volunteer for going inside?

01:10:23.247 --> 01:10:27.016
Brave volunteer stepping up.

01:10:27.018 --> 01:10:31.753
Stop. Only wizards
are allowed inside our cave.

01:10:31.755 --> 01:10:34.857
Well!

01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:36.726
Only wizards?

01:10:36.728 --> 01:10:39.628
There I was,
worrying about those dumb kids.

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.263
Oh!

01:10:41.265 --> 01:10:43.633
I am the only wizard left.

01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:47.736
Orchids, I am the Grump.

01:10:47.738 --> 01:10:49.207
Ah!

01:10:51.276 --> 01:10:56.148
Welcome to
the Cave of Whispering Orchids.

01:11:06.123 --> 01:11:11.060
♪ When, oh, when
will my prince arrive ♪

01:11:11.062 --> 01:11:15.765
♪ A dream of love
that could come true ♪

01:11:15.767 --> 01:11:19.535

♪ Who likes me

01:11:30.782 --> 01:11:32.017
Bip!

01:11:33.852 --> 01:11:36.686
Well, Bip's nose anyway.

01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:41.089
Ah, the rest of Bip.

01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:46.295
Well, I've been embroidering
as I await my true prince, see?

01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:57.307
He found the cave?
Well, good for him.

01:11:59.277 --> 01:12:01.143
The Grump did what?

01:12:01.145 --> 01:12:02.645
Oh, my!

01:12:02.647 --> 01:12:03.882
Terry!

01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:08.651
That stubborn boy needs us.

01:12:08.653 --> 01:12:11.557
But how will we get there
in time?

01:12:18.996 --> 01:12:22.332
To the rescue,
whatever your name is.

01:12:22.334 --> 01:12:24.366
Oh, my fair princess!

01:12:24.368 --> 01:12:26.369
At last I have found thee.

01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:28.704
- Kingdoms...
- Yeah, whatever. Tell me later.

01:12:28.706 --> 01:12:31.242
I've got to go
rescue someone.

01:13:14.184 --> 01:13:16.287
Huh? Where am I?

01:13:19.056 --> 01:13:21.057
You're safe now. Ooh.

01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:33.168
Wait. Weren't you
under my gloomy spell?

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.871
Hmm. And you.

01:13:35.873 --> 01:13:39.008
You were under
my sleepy spell.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.744
Oh, give me a break.

01:13:41.746 --> 01:13:45.448
And that key, it wasn't inside
that blasted cave.

01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.084
You! You took it.

01:13:48.086 --> 01:13:52.187
Me? I couldn't have taken it.
Didn't the orchids tell you?

01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:55.290
Only a wizard
can get inside the cave.

01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:58.293
Hmm. So they did.

01:13:58.295 --> 01:14:00.929
What? Only wizards?

01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:03.068
We're doomed, Terry-Terry.

01:14:04.335 --> 01:14:06.069
That's what the orchids said.

01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:09.041
But maybe the orchids
can be a little melodramatic.

01:14:13.044 --> 01:14:16.148
I will guard this key
with my life.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:23.988
Or I'll just run away with it,
if it's easier.

01:14:48.779 --> 01:14:50.416
Dingo, stop!

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:04.862
Tie them all up
and go and get my blimp back.

01:15:17.975 --> 01:15:20.008
Turn left two centimeters.

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:23.047
In approximately
three millimeters, turn right.

01:15:28.486 --> 01:15:30.218
Come on.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:33.388
Dawn must go!
Dawn must go!

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:34.460
Dawn must go!

01:15:45.502 --> 01:15:48.170
So how did you get that key?

01:15:48.172 --> 01:15:50.405
I don't know.
The orchids just let me in.

01:15:50.407 --> 01:15:53.878
Maybe I could be
a wizard too.

01:15:58.315 --> 01:16:01.883
No, think about it.
Orchids, the kiss, the rabbit...

01:16:01.885 --> 01:16:04.119
- What rabbit?
- My blimp being Grump's blimp.

01:16:04.121 --> 01:16:06.054
My grandma being all alone.

01:16:06.056 --> 01:16:08.591
Okay, but how do you
cast spells then?

01:16:08.593 --> 01:16:11.293
Well, I mean,
obviously, it's...

01:16:11.295 --> 01:16:12.363
Abracadabra!

01:16:16.835 --> 01:16:18.036
Hocus pocus.

01:16:19.537 --> 01:16:21.436
Grump is gonna
destroy the key.

01:16:21.438 --> 01:16:23.438
We need to think
of something fast.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.843
We need to hurry up!
Chop-chop!

01:16:26.845 --> 01:16:28.110
Say that again.

01:16:28.112 --> 01:16:29.782
Chop-chop? Huh?

01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:37.823
Keys, chop-chop.

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:42.991
Oops.

01:16:42.993 --> 01:16:44.427
Bip's nose!

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:47.899
And the keys.
Oh, well done, Bip.

01:16:49.466 --> 01:16:53.471
Looks like your magic
isn't necessary this time.

01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:58.039
Dawn must go!
Dawn must go!

01:16:58.041 --> 01:17:01.813
Dawn must go!
Dawn must go!

01:17:07.452 --> 01:17:11.023
Let's put an end to happiness.

01:17:25.536 --> 01:17:27.139
Terry, be careful!

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:40.615
I'm a wizard.

01:17:40.617 --> 01:17:43.287
I can do this.
Chop-chop!

01:17:47.058 --> 01:17:49.292
Thank you, you fool.

01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:50.863
Maybe not.

01:17:56.533 --> 01:17:59.000
Dawn must go!

01:17:59.002 --> 01:18:00.238
Chop-chop.

01:18:04.274 --> 01:18:05.509
Uh-oh.

01:18:19.256 --> 01:18:22.027
The key. It's broken.

01:18:26.563 --> 01:18:29.365
Well, I think
we did quite well.

01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:33.703
Almost saved my kingdom
and almost sent you back home.

01:18:33.705 --> 01:18:36.475
Yeah, we came close.

01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:42.445
And it sorta seems
as though you were right.

01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:45.280
Perhaps I don't need a prince
to save me after all.

01:18:45.282 --> 01:18:47.383
And you don't need the key
to go back home.

01:18:47.385 --> 01:18:49.685
- Huh?
- There's your blimp!

01:18:49.687 --> 01:18:53.188
Use your magic and say,
"Chop-chop!"

01:18:55.393 --> 01:18:58.293
It's dangerous.
Come with me.

01:18:58.295 --> 01:18:59.762
I am the queen.

01:18:59.764 --> 01:19:01.998
I must stay.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.038
Dawn must go! Dawn must go!
Dawn must go! Dawn must go!

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.106
Dawn must go!
Dawn must go!

01:19:11.108 --> 01:19:13.077
I'll stay here with you.

01:19:39.303 --> 01:19:41.473
Hooray!

01:19:50.814 --> 01:19:52.615
What happened?

01:19:52.617 --> 01:19:54.350
We found happiness.

01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:58.721
It only works
when you're ready to let it go.

01:19:58.723 --> 01:20:01.326
Nooo!

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.229
You!

01:20:06.563 --> 01:20:07.665
Get him!

01:21:40.358 --> 01:21:42.761
That's...

01:21:53.504 --> 01:21:55.704
A young man.

01:21:55.706 --> 01:21:56.775
Oh.

01:22:01.645 --> 01:22:03.344
Mary.

01:22:03.346 --> 01:22:05.250
Ohh...

01:22:10.321 --> 01:22:14.289
My Grandma Mary,
your girl,

01:22:14.291 --> 01:22:16.392
she could never return
to your world,

01:22:16.394 --> 01:22:18.860
so she built this park
as a way to remember you.

01:22:21.666 --> 01:22:24.200
Oh, Mary.

01:22:38.815 --> 01:22:43.220
I only wanted
to make everyone happy.

01:22:46.657 --> 01:22:48.557
We still can.

01:22:48.559 --> 01:22:50.529
Grandpa.

01:23:46.783 --> 01:23:50.522
Two minutes to the final show!
Just two minutes!

01:23:54.759 --> 01:23:57.625
It meant a lot
that you could come.

01:23:57.627 --> 01:23:59.598
I'd like you to meet
my parents.

01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:02.765
Dad, this is Dawn.

01:24:02.767 --> 01:24:03.766
Oh, charmed.

01:24:03.768 --> 01:24:05.066
Oh, hello.

01:24:05.068 --> 01:24:06.502
Where's Mum?

01:24:06.504 --> 01:24:07.735
Jocelyn, honey?

01:24:07.737 --> 01:24:09.672
Oh!

01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:13.542
Hello.

01:24:13.544 --> 01:24:15.043
Oh!

01:24:15.045 --> 01:24:16.678
Nice meeting you.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:21.482
Oh, and you must be
Terry's fiancé.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.686
No, um...

01:24:24.688 --> 01:24:26.554
It's a little too early
for that.

01:24:26.556 --> 01:24:29.825
We've only known
each other a month.

01:24:29.827 --> 01:24:32.527
Can I, uh...

01:24:32.529 --> 01:24:33.928
Of course.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:37.533
Well, we love what you did
to the park here.

01:24:37.535 --> 01:24:39.735
See you later.

01:24:39.737 --> 01:24:40.805
Come on, Malcolm.

01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:48.643
How's everything going
back home?

01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:51.347
People are very happy
with the changes I've suggested.

01:24:51.349 --> 01:24:53.481
Me like pay when me works.

01:24:53.483 --> 01:24:57.018
And soon we'll be having grammar
classes for everyone too.

01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.686
Oh, no!

01:24:58.688 --> 01:25:00.823
Here comes the Grump!

01:25:00.825 --> 01:25:04.426
You blasted kids,
I'll get you all!

01:25:04.428 --> 01:25:05.729
Dingo, attack!
Ha ha!

01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:16.771
This is the best
amusement park ever!

01:25:16.773 --> 01:25:18.073
Whoo!

01:25:18.075 --> 01:25:19.540
Waah!

01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:21.880
Oh, chop-chop.

01:25:23.848 --> 01:25:25.981
Ah, first month
of the reopening,

01:25:25.983 --> 01:25:28.816
and we've already paid off
all our debts.

01:25:28.818 --> 01:25:30.785
Not bad, Terry, not bad.

01:25:30.787 --> 01:25:33.789
Thanks, and not bad
for the ol' Grump either.

01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:36.691
Whoa!

01:25:36.693 --> 01:25:38.494
