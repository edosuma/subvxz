WEBVTT

00:07.178 --> 00:08.548
PREVIOUSLY ON
"MELISSA & JOEY..."

00:08.549 --> 00:09.679
A SECRET DAUGHTER?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.052
THEN THAT WOULD MAKE YOU MY DAD?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.133
IT WOULD.

00:13.134 --> 00:15.095
HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

00:15.096 --> 00:17.597
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
TRUSTING ME ANYMORE. WE'RE DONE.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.019
DANI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.942
LIKE I WAS GONNA MISS
MY DAD'S WEDDING.

00:23.604 --> 00:27.147
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:27.148 --> 00:29.069
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M MORE ANGRY ABOUT.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.451
THE FACT THAT YOU RAN AWAY FROM
HOME WITHOUT TELLING YOUR MOTHER

00:31.452 --> 00:33.953
OR THAT YOU JUST STUCK
ME WITH A $400 CAB FAIR.

00:33.954 --> 00:35.785
IN MY DEFENSE, I TRIED TO PAY

00:35.786 --> 00:37.247
WITH THESE EARRINGS.

00:37.248 --> 00:38.828
THEY'RE REAL GOLD.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.660
AWW, JOE, THAT'S SO SWEET.

00:40.661 --> 00:43.463
DANI WAS GONNA GIVE UP HER
EARRINGS TO SEE HER DAD.

00:43.464 --> 00:47.627
- OH, THESE AREN'T MINE. THESE ARE MY MOM'S.
- YOU STOLE THEM?!

00:47.628 --> 00:50.049
WHAT?! I'M GONNA GET
THEM WHEN SHE DIES.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.592
OKAY, LOOK, THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

00:52.593 --> 00:54.554
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, I
TRIED TO PAY A CAB DRIVER

00:54.555 --> 00:56.055
- BY GIVING HIM A...
- MEL!

00:56.056 --> 00:57.937
...BORROWED CREDIT
CARD FROM MY DAD!

00:57.938 --> 00:59.349
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA SAY?

00:59.350 --> 01:01.441
DO ME A FAVOR, JOE.

01:01.442 --> 01:02.942
JUST DON'T CALL MY MOM, OKAY?

01:02.943 --> 01:06.186
OH MY GOD, YOU BROUGHT HER BACK.

01:06.187 --> 01:08.488
OH-OH! GIVE ME HUG,

01:08.489 --> 01:10.860
MY LITTLE ILLEGITIMATE
GRANDDAUGHTER.

01:10.861 --> 01:15.695
OH, I AM SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU.

01:15.696 --> 01:18.998
( muffled ) NICE TO
MEET YOU TOO, LADY.

01:18.999 --> 01:20.370
DON'T GO GETTING
TOO ATTACHED, MOM.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.122
SHE'S GOING BACK FIRST
THING TOMORROW MORNING.

01:22.123 --> 01:24.084
WHAT IS SHE, A SHELTER DOG?

01:24.965 --> 01:26.126
WHEN DID YOU EAT LAST?

01:26.127 --> 01:28.468
YOU LOOK LIKE A TWIG WITH EYES.

01:28.469 --> 01:30.049
GRANDMA WILL FIX THAT.

01:30.050 --> 01:32.512
OH, YEAH, LET HER HAVE
ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

01:32.513 --> 01:34.304
MY DAUGHTER IS BASICALLY
A RUNAWAY JEWEL THIEF,

01:34.305 --> 01:35.555
AND YOU'RE MAKING ALL NICE.

01:35.556 --> 01:36.716
WELL, I JUST WANT HER
TO FEEL WELCOME HERE.

01:36.717 --> 01:38.428
YEAH, WELL, FELICIA
GOES ON TOUR TOMORROW.

01:38.429 --> 01:40.310
SO SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK
UP HERE TONIGHT AND GET DANI.

01:40.311 --> 01:41.681
OH, COME ON, LET HER
STAY FOR THE WEDDING.

01:41.682 --> 01:43.143
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, HER
MOTHER WOULD FREAK OUT.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.145
ALL RIGHT? SECONDLY,
LETTING HER STAY HERE,

01:45.146 --> 01:46.936
WOULDN'T THAT BE REWARDING
THAT TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR?

01:46.937 --> 01:49.108
SO WE'LL TELL HER, "NO CAKE."

01:49.109 --> 01:51.991
CALL FELICIA AND TELL HER WE'LL
SORT EVERYTHING OUT IN THE MORNING.

01:51.992 --> 01:54.033
AND YOU KNOW, TRY TO LIGHTEN UP.

01:54.034 --> 01:56.446
TOMORROW'S OUR WEDDING
DAY, TAKE TWO.

01:56.447 --> 01:59.079
AND I'M GONNA VOW
YOUR BRAINS OUT.

02:00.291 --> 02:01.741
( theme music plays )

02:01.742 --> 02:06.837
♪ I GUESS YOUR STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:13.964 --> 02:16.015
I'M SORRY. I'LL GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

02:16.016 --> 02:17.597
NO, I DON'T CARE.

02:17.598 --> 02:19.559
STAY, GO... IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.601
I TAKE IT THE RECONCILIATION

02:21.602 --> 02:23.102
WITH THE ARTIST
DIDN'T GO SO WELL.

02:23.103 --> 02:24.974
YEAH, ZANDER SLEPT
WITH HIS ROOMMATE.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.065
OOPH.

02:26.066 --> 02:29.399
HIS ROOMMATE'S A GIRL, RIGHT?

02:29.400 --> 02:32.111
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU MEN?
ARE YOU ALL JUST HORRIBLE?

02:32.112 --> 02:34.324
GRANDMA SOPHIA USED TO SAY,

02:34.325 --> 02:38.037
"IF YOU HAVE ONE, YOU ARE ONE."

02:38.038 --> 02:40.159
A LOT OF DEEP
THINKERS IN JERSEY.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.581
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:41.582 --> 02:43.583
I GOT TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT I DID EARLIER.

02:43.584 --> 02:47.247
I WAS A JERK TO SHOW ZANDER
THOSE PICTURES OF US.

02:47.248 --> 02:49.289
NO, ZANDER'S THE JERK.

02:49.290 --> 02:50.960
IF HE CAN GO OFF
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,

02:50.961 --> 02:53.092
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT? SO CAN I.

02:53.093 --> 02:54.254

02:54.255 --> 02:56.556

HEY, HEY, HEY, UH, AS MUCH AS

02:58.299 --> 03:01.221
PORTIONS OF ME ARE VERY
INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL,

03:01.222 --> 03:03.223
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT
BE COMING ON TO ME

03:03.224 --> 03:04.604
OUT OF REVENGE.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.266
SO? WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

03:06.267 --> 03:09.360
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
A PIECE OF MEAT.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.022
OH, SO YOU RUIN MY RELATIONSHIP

03:13.023 --> 03:15.445
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT WILLING
TO HELP ME MOVE ON?

03:15.446 --> 03:17.157
THANKS A LOT.

03:22.082 --> 03:24.455

03:36.096 --> 03:39.008
I'M SO HUNGRY, I BIT THE INSIDE
OF MY CHEEK THIS MORNING

03:39.009 --> 03:40.261
AND JUST KEPT CHEWING.

03:45.306 --> 03:47.016
DID YOU TELL HER
ABOUT THE JUDGE YET?

03:47.017 --> 03:49.349
- WHAT? WHAT ABOUT HIM?!
- THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL...

03:49.350 --> 03:51.401
EXCEPT HE CAN'T MAKE IT.

03:51.402 --> 03:52.852

SMOOTH EVERYTHING OVER.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?
THAT IS A VERY SWEET GESTURE,

04:53.964 --> 04:55.375
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE,
YOUR MOM IS RIGHT.

04:55.376 --> 04:57.337
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY,
YOU KNOW, GO WITH HER.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.339
- WHAT IF I STAY WITH YOU?
- HE JUST MET YOU.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.010
HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
MOVING IN WITH HIM.

05:01.011 --> 05:03.262
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. NOW, DON'T
GO PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

05:03.263 --> 05:05.555
LOOK, YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.
IF YOU WANT TO STAY HERE,

05:05.556 --> 05:07.848
- YOU CAN STAY HERE.

ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.985
YEAH, I MEAN THAT.
YOU COULD STAY HERE.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.527
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HERE?

05:17.528 --> 05:19.649
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU GO
STICK YOUR NEEDLES

NOT BE ENOUGH TIME.

05:40.130 --> 05:41.461
FINE.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.962
BUT I'M GONNA MISS YOU, HONEY.

05:42.963 --> 05:45.515

WIFE GONNA THINK

05:45.516 --> 05:46.886
ABOUT THE NEW ADDITION
TO THE FAMILY?

05:46.887 --> 05:48.678
OH, I GUARANTEE YOU. SHE...
SHE IS GONNA BE

05:48.679 --> 05:50.019
SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.641
( chuckles )

05:51.642 --> 05:53.353
AND SURPRISED.

05:59.029 --> 06:00.650
( knocking )

06:00.651 --> 06:02.071
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

06:02.072 --> 06:03.362
OH, I'M JUST ENJOYING

06:03.363 --> 06:05.074
A DELIGHTFUL GLASS
OF KALE JUICE.

06:05.075 --> 06:08.367
MM-HMM, IT'S NOT VERY TASTY,
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.369
IT'S DISGUSTING.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.291
I CANNOT WAIT TILL
THE END OF THIS DAY.

06:12.292 --> 06:13.703
TILL WE'RE HUSBAND AND WIFE?

06:13.704 --> 06:15.254
TILL I CAN LOOK AT YOU

06:15.255 --> 06:17.126
AND NOT SEE A BARBECUED CHICKEN
WHERE YOUR HEAD SHOULD BE.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.668
( chuckles )

06:18.669 --> 06:21.461
SO, UM, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF DANI?

06:21.462 --> 06:24.343
- UGH, SHE'S GREAT.
- I KNOW. SHE IS, ISN'T SHE?

06:24.344 --> 06:25.675
HM-HMM, YEAH, BUT I GOT TO SAY,

06:25.676 --> 06:27.717
THE RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME,
STEALING FROM HER MOM,

06:27.718 --> 06:29.218
ALL THAT DEFIANCE, UGH!

06:29.219 --> 06:30.930
SHE REMINDS ME OF
ME AT THAT AGE...

06:30.931 --> 06:33.182
ONLY WORSE. SHE'S
GOT YOUR MOUTH.

06:33.183 --> 06:36.225
( chuckles ) YEAH,
SHE'S A HANDFUL.

06:36.226 --> 06:37.276
YEAH, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

06:37.277 --> 06:38.438
I WOULD NOT TRADE
PLACES WITH FELICIA

06:38.439 --> 06:40.359
FOR ALL THE MERLOT IN AISLE FOUR

06:40.360 --> 06:41.481
AT DISCOUNT WINE BARN.

06:41.482 --> 06:43.903
( chuckles ) WHAT IF YOU DID?

06:43.904 --> 06:44.944
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T.

06:44.945 --> 06:47.697
YEAH, YOU KIND OF DID.

06:47.698 --> 06:51.160
YOU SEE, UM, HONEY, I...
I... I...

06:51.161 --> 06:52.952
I SORT OF TOLD DANI THAT, UH...

06:52.953 --> 06:56.295
THAT... THAT SHE COULD STAY
WITH US FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

06:56.296 --> 06:57.747
HOW LITTLE?

06:57.748 --> 07:00.089
- SIX MONTHS.
- SIX MONTHS?!

07:00.090 --> 07:03.132
YEAH, OH, IT'S... IT'S
JUST GONNA FLY RIGHT BY.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.134
- ( chuckles )
- WAIT, JOE,

07:05.135 --> 07:08.548
YOU MADE THIS HUGE
LIFE-ALTERING DECISION

07:08.549 --> 07:10.680
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME FIRST?

07:10.681 --> 07:12.311
NOW?!

07:12.312 --> 07:15.054
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN EAT
MY FEELINGS AWAY?!

07:15.055 --> 07:16.516
I HAD NO CHOICE, ALL RIGHT?

07:16.517 --> 07:18.147
HER MOTHER LEAVES TO GO ON
TOUR TOMORROW FOR SIX MONTHS.

07:18.148 --> 07:19.689
I MEAN, I CAN'T
JUST ABANDON DANI.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.940
WELL, LOOK, I'M NOT A LAWYER,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.021
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S
CALLED ABANDONMENT

07:22.022 --> 07:23.323
WHEN YOU LEAVE A CHILD
WITH HER MOTHER!

07:24.324 --> 07:26.065
OKAY, I AM NOT UPSET

07:26.066 --> 07:27.487
THAT DANI IS GONNA STAY HERE.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.030
I'M UPSET THAT YOU MADE
THIS DECISION ON YOUR OWN.

07:31.331 --> 07:32.371
MARRIAGE MEANS WE'RE A TEAM.

07:32.372 --> 07:33.784
WE ARE A TEAM...

07:34.995 --> 07:36.876
STARTING NOW. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:36.877 --> 07:38.918
WE ARE GONNA BE THE
BEST FRICKIN' TEAM

07:38.919 --> 07:41.130
SINCE SIEGFRIED AND ROY.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.963
I DON'T KNOW WHY I
JUST PICKED THAT TEAM.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.928
ARE YOU OKAY?

07:48.929 --> 07:51.220
I KIND OF NEED TO
BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.263
UM, I NEED TO THINK
ABOUT ALL THIS.

07:54.264 --> 07:56.185
ABOUT DANI?

07:56.186 --> 07:58.057
ABOUT ALL OF IT.

07:58.058 --> 08:00.399
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.982
HEY, LOOK, THIS IS... THIS
IS ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.193
ALL RIGHT? I PROMISE YOU.

08:04.194 --> 08:06.606
MEL, THIS...

08:06.607 --> 08:08.107
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

08:08.108 --> 08:10.660
THIS IS ALL A DISASTER.

08:10.661 --> 08:13.372
YOU TOLD MEL YOUR
SURPRISE DAUGHTER

08:13.373 --> 08:14.784
IS MOVING IN!

08:14.785 --> 08:16.455
YOU DON'T DROP A BOMB LIKE THAT

08:16.456 --> 08:18.247
ON THE BRIDE RIGHT
BEFORE HER WEDDING.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.709
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, MOM?!

08:19.710 --> 08:21.711
WAIT UNTIL AFTER
YOU GET MARRIED.

08:21.712 --> 08:25.254
THEN YOU'RE STUCK TOGETHER AND
THE UGLY TRUTH CAN COME OUT.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.256
I DID THE RIGHT THING
AND YOU KNOW IT.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.888
DIDN'T I?

08:28.889 --> 08:30.339
HEY, YOU GUYS GET IT, RIGHT?

08:30.340 --> 08:31.340
HOW LONG IS SHE STAYING

08:31.341 --> 08:32.592
AND AM I SHARING A BATHROOM?

08:32.593 --> 08:34.684
RYDER, THAT IS NOT
THE KIND OF QUESTION

08:34.685 --> 08:37.226
YOU SHOULD BE ASKING
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

08:37.227 --> 08:38.898
BUT SERIOUSLY WHERE
IS SHE SLEEPING?

08:38.899 --> 08:40.479
NOT IN MY ROOM, THAT'S FOR SURE.

08:40.480 --> 08:41.941
HEY, JOE, ARE THERE
MORE KIDS COMING?

08:41.942 --> 08:43.192
IS THIS GONNA BECOME
LIKE JOE LONGO'S

08:43.193 --> 08:45.775
GROUP HOME FOR SECRET CHILDREN?

08:45.776 --> 08:47.446
YOU KNOW, I CANNOT
BELIEVE THAT MY FAMILY

08:47.447 --> 08:49.699
AND MY ALMOST FAMILY
IS REACTING LIKE THIS.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.450
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED

08:51.451 --> 08:53.202
ABOUT HOW YOUR ALMOST BRIDE

08:53.203 --> 08:54.994
IS REACTING.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.365
WHAT DID MEL SAY?

08:56.366 --> 08:58.077
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED
SOME TIME ALONE

08:58.078 --> 09:00.289
TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF IT.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.751
"ALL OF IT"?

09:01.752 --> 09:03.422
OH-OH, THAT'S BAD.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.795
SHE MIGHT NOT WANT TO
MARRY YOU NOW, JOEY.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.007
- OH.
- THE POOR WOMAN ALREADY GOT STUCK

09:08.008 --> 09:09.720
RAISING TWO KIDS
SHE DIDN'T WANT.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.973
EXCUSE ME, "TWO KIDS
SHE DIDN'T WANT"?

09:13.974 --> 09:15.554
OH! I WAS KIDDING. ( laughs )

09:15.555 --> 09:17.848
DON'T TAKE THINGS SO LITERALLY.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.774
SO, AM I OFFICIATING A CEREMONY
THIS AFTERNOON OR NOT?

09:24.775 --> 09:27.146
IT ISN'T ALL ABOUT YOU, DEAR.

09:27.147 --> 09:30.190
I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT
THIS DRESS FOR NOTHING.

09:34.745 --> 09:37.246
GRANDMA'S IRONING MY SHIRT.

09:37.247 --> 09:41.580
SO, UH, LISTEN,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.163
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR BEING SUCH A GENTLEMAN

09:44.164 --> 09:46.165
AND NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME

09:46.166 --> 09:50.089
WHEN I WAS KIND OF...
DRUNK ON RAGE.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.631
IT WASN'T EASY.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.343
YOU'RE REALLY HOT
WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.384
( laughs )

09:55.385 --> 09:57.216
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO SCREW THINGS UP,

09:57.217 --> 09:59.058
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU

09:59.059 --> 10:01.181
AND I REALLY RESPECT YOU.

10:03.393 --> 10:05.725
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT MORE GOING ON

10:05.726 --> 10:07.526
UNDER THE SURFACE
THAN I FIRST THOUGHT.

10:07.527 --> 10:10.230
YEAH, I GOT A LOT OF LAYERS.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.653
- I'M LIKE A LASAGNA.
- ( snickers )

10:13.654 --> 10:15.364
I LIKE LASAGNA.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.617
( both chuckle )

10:21.161 --> 10:23.162
MEL.

10:23.163 --> 10:24.453
HEY, HONEY, IT'S ME.
LISTEN, I...

10:24.454 --> 10:27.296
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M...
THAT I'M SORRY.

10:27.297 --> 10:29.209
MEL?

10:31.341 --> 10:32.342
MEL?

10:33.213 --> 10:35.135
HONEY?

10:38.759 --> 10:40.519
OH MY GOD.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.183
RUNAWAY BRIDE.

10:46.817 --> 10:48.107
MEL IS GONE!

10:48.108 --> 10:50.529
OH, RELAX, DRAMA QUEEN.
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.532
OH, HEY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE

10:53.533 --> 10:55.484
SO UPSET WITH ME THAT YOU
WEREN'T GONNA MARRY ME.

10:55.485 --> 10:57.987
WELL, YEAH, IT WAS TOTALLY OFF,

10:57.988 --> 10:59.278
BUT THEN I HAD SOLID FOOD

10:59.279 --> 11:01.871
AND I WASN'T HOMICIDAL ANYMORE.

11:01.872 --> 11:03.372
YEAH, WE HAVE A
SAYING IN MY FAMILY.

11:03.373 --> 11:04.744
"PROSCIUTTO FIXES EVERYTHING."

11:04.745 --> 11:06.125
WE HAVE THE SAME
SAYING IN MY FAMILY,

11:06.126 --> 11:08.047
BUT WITH ALCOHOL.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.750
SO HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT
THE WHOLE DANI SITUATION?

11:10.751 --> 11:12.842
WELL, YOU KNOW,
DANI'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:12.843 --> 11:15.294
AND IF I LOVE YOU,
I'M GONNA LOVE HER.

11:15.295 --> 11:16.425
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.007
HEY, HEY!

11:18.008 --> 11:20.469
DON'T STOP. I CAN TALK AND EAT.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.061
SHE'S GONE.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.263
NAW, MOM, SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
SHE JUST NEEDED A SANDWICH.

11:24.264 --> 11:27.356
NOT HER... DANI. I
FOUND THIS NOTE.

11:27.357 --> 11:28.728
WHAT?

11:28.729 --> 11:30.399
"I'M SORRY I MESSED
EVERYTHING UP, JOE.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.610
DON'T WORRY, MEL
WON'T HAVE TO RAISE

11:31.611 --> 11:33.442
ANOTHER KID SHE DOESN'T WANT.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.074
I'M TAKING OFF."

11:35.075 --> 11:37.276
- OH MY GOD.
- WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

11:37.277 --> 11:39.158
EVERYBODY, MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE YOUR JEWELRY.

11:39.159 --> 11:41.240
SHE'S A KNOWN THIEF.

11:41.241 --> 11:42.702
SHE DID THAT ONCE, MOM...

11:43.744 --> 11:45.034
THAT WE KNOW OF.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.166
ALL RIGHT, IT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HURT TO CHECK.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.542
HEY, MARCO! ARE YOU IN THERE?

11:53.543 --> 11:55.755
HUH? UH...

11:55.756 --> 11:58.097
- ( shuffling )
- YEAH, YEAH, UH, SURE.

11:58.098 --> 11:59.598
COME IN.

11:59.599 --> 12:01.260
HEY.

12:01.261 --> 12:04.764
I WAS, UH, JUST GETTING
DRESSED FOR THE WEDDING.

12:04.765 --> 12:08.227
WHAT'S UP?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.558
DANI RAN AWAY, ALL RIGHT?
SO I NEED YOU

12:09.559 --> 12:10.980
TO PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AND
GO AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD

12:10.981 --> 12:11.981
AND HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.443
OF COURSE, UNCLE JOE.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.655
HE'S GONE.

12:17.657 --> 12:19.448
I DON'T THINK HE
SUSPECTED ANYTHING.

12:19.449 --> 12:21.410
IF HE DID, I DON'T
THINK YOUR HEAD

12:21.411 --> 12:22.741
WOULD STILL BE
ATTACHED TO YOUR BODY.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.574
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH IT.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.418
WELL, THE POLICE SAID
THEY'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.580
AND I JUST GAVE DANI'S
DESCRIPTION TO THE MALL COPS.

12:31.581 --> 12:34.373
WHY WOULD SHE GO TO THE
MALL AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

12:34.374 --> 12:36.465
WELL, WOMEN DO LIKE TO SHOP
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET, RIGHT?

12:36.466 --> 12:38.878
THAT IS SUCH A
SEXIST STEREOTYPE.

12:38.879 --> 12:41.590
- WELL, I WOULD DO THAT.
- WELL, ACTUALLY I LOVE TO.

12:41.591 --> 12:43.302
ONCE, WHEN I GUY
BROKE UP WITH ME,

12:43.303 --> 12:45.305
I BOUGHT A CANOE.

12:46.306 --> 12:47.436
I DIDN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO DO THIS,

12:47.437 --> 12:48.938
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CALL FELICIA

12:48.939 --> 12:50.099
AND TELL HER THAT I
LOST OUR DAUGHTER,

12:50.100 --> 12:51.190
DAY ONE.

12:51.191 --> 12:52.892
HEY, UNCLE JOE.

12:52.893 --> 12:54.193
I GOT NEWS.

12:54.194 --> 12:57.396
I THINK YOUR LITTLE
SECRET GIRL IS UP THERE.

12:57.397 --> 12:58.899
OH MY GOD, SHE'S DEAD?

13:00.320 --> 13:01.821
NO, SHE'S ON THE ROOF.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.113
THE ROOF, OF COURSE,

13:04.114 --> 13:05.744
WHERE THE TEENAGE
GIRLS IN THIS HOUSE

13:05.745 --> 13:07.406
TRADITIONALLY RUN AWAY TO.

13:07.407 --> 13:09.368
JOE, MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

13:09.369 --> 13:10.369
YOU KNOW, SHE THINKS I'M THE ONE

13:10.370 --> 13:11.832
THAT DOESN'T WANT HER HERE.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.756
DANI, UGH! I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE SAFE...

13:17.757 --> 13:21.340
UP HERE ON THE ROOF TWO
STORIES ABOVE THE GROUND.

13:21.341 --> 13:22.721
WE THOUGHT YOU RAN AWAY.

13:22.722 --> 13:25.514
I TRIED, BUT I DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO RUN TO.

13:25.515 --> 13:27.887
I FIGURED UP HERE, I'D
BE OUT OF YOUR WAY.

13:27.888 --> 13:30.559
I CAN TELL WHEN I'M NOT WANTED.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.432
NO, YOU'RE LIKE AMERICA'S
MOST WANTED...

13:33.433 --> 13:35.734
SURPRISE KID.

13:35.735 --> 13:37.396
YOU AREN'T GONNA MARRY
JOE BECAUSE OF ME.

13:37.397 --> 13:39.818
NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT WAS
JUST THE JUICE FAST TALKING.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.941
I BUT I HEARD GLORIA SAY
THAT YOU'RE ALREADY RAISING

13:41.942 --> 13:43.362
KIDS THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT.

13:43.363 --> 13:45.905
LOOK, I FEEL I CAN BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU,

13:45.906 --> 13:47.867
BECAUSE YOU'RE A VERY MATURE KID

13:47.868 --> 13:50.370
AND I HAD A XANAX A
LITTLE WHILE AGO.

13:51.501 --> 13:54.543
SOMETIMES THE UNIVERSE THROWS
UNEXPECTED THINGS AT YOU,

13:54.544 --> 13:57.836
AND LATER ON, YOU FIND OUT THAT
THEY ARE A WONDERFUL GIFT.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.129
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.171
NO, LOOK, LENNOX AND
RYDER ARE AWESOME.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.462
AND IF THEY HADN'T
COME INTO MY LIFE,

14:03.463 --> 14:05.384
THEN JOE WOULDN'T HAVE
COME INTO MY LIFE.

14:05.385 --> 14:07.016
AND I LOVE JOE.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.387
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM, TOO.

14:08.388 --> 14:09.929
I KNOW HE TAKES A
LITTLE GETTING USED TO.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.891
I LIKE HIM FINE.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.973
YOU'RE THE ONE I'M
NOT SURE ABOUT.

14:13.974 --> 14:16.025
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME,

14:16.026 --> 14:17.477
BECAUSE I AM DELIGHTFUL.

14:18.478 --> 14:20.400
IT'S TRUE. TRUST ME.

14:22.322 --> 14:23.612
AND, DANI, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

14:23.613 --> 14:27.746
MEL AND I... WE'RE A
PACKAGE DEAL, HERE.

14:27.747 --> 14:30.329
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:30.330 --> 14:32.581
WOULD YOU BUY ME A CAR?

14:32.582 --> 14:33.622
- YES.
- NO.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.623
SHE'S 13.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.046
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A SALE HERE.

14:37.047 --> 14:38.707
LEAVE THE SELLING
TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

14:38.708 --> 14:42.922
LISTEN, WE ARE BOTH VERY
HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.303
AND I THINK

14:44.304 --> 14:47.766
THAT IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT
YOU TWO LADIES GET DRESSED.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.508
OOH, YEAH, WE GOT A DREAM
WEDDING TO GET TO.

14:49.509 --> 14:52.561
YES, WE DO. SO?

14:52.562 --> 14:54.813
- LET'S DO IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

14:54.814 --> 14:56.895
I WAS STARTING TO THINK THIS
WEDDING WAS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.317
- YEAH.
- OH, LOOK, A LUCKY PENNY.

14:58.318 --> 14:59.358
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN...

14:59.359 --> 15:00.819
- ( screams )
- OH, OH!

15:00.820 --> 15:02.111
( crashing )

15:02.112 --> 15:03.362
I'M OKAY.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.404
I BET YOU'RE GLAD I
DIDN'T SWITCH OUT

15:05.405 --> 15:07.527
THOSE SHRUBS FOR
ROSES, HUH, HONEY?

15:12.492 --> 15:15.294
SO, LOOK, NO PRESSURE HERE, DOC,

15:15.295 --> 15:18.667
BUT, UM, WE ARE SCHEDULED TO...

15:18.668 --> 15:22.501
GET MARRIED IN 16 MINUTES.

15:22.502 --> 15:24.423
YEAH, I'M AFRAID SHE CAN'T
WALK DOWN THE AISLE

15:24.424 --> 15:25.714
FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.

15:25.715 --> 15:28.467
FOUR TO...

15:28.468 --> 15:31.720
SORRY, EVERYBODY,
WEDDING IS OFF.

15:31.721 --> 15:34.353
AGAIN? YOU CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS TO PEOPLE.

15:34.354 --> 15:36.435
I'M WEARING TWO PAIRS OF SPANX.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.648
NO, WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED RIGHT NOW.

15:39.649 --> 15:42.061
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- I AM.

15:42.062 --> 15:43.822
THAT'S THE BURKE SPIRIT.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.904
DON'T LET LITTLE BUMPS
KEEP YOU FROM YOUR GOALS,

15:45.905 --> 15:49.868
WHETHER IT'S A BROKEN LEG OR
AN ESCORTS-FOR-VOTES SCANDAL.

15:49.869 --> 15:52.781
I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT
SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.333
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

15:54.334 --> 15:56.335
WOULD THESE EYES LIE?

15:56.336 --> 15:58.457
WOULD THEY DO ANYTHING ELSE?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.879
OKAY, BUT, WAIT, WE'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT TO THE ARBORETUM,

16:00.880 --> 16:02.421
SO WHERE ARE WE GONNA
DO THE CEREMONY?

16:02.422 --> 16:04.253
HERE. WE'VE GOT
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.464
WE'VE GOT OUR MINISTER.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.886
HEY, I CAN HAVE YOU TWO
HITCHED IN NO TIME.

16:07.887 --> 16:10.349
AND I CAN GO NEXT DOOR
AND STEAL SOME FLOWERS.

16:10.350 --> 16:13.052
- WH...
- BORROW SOME FLOWERS.

16:13.053 --> 16:16.305
OH, LIKE THE GUY IN THE
COMA'S GONNA NOTICE.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.227
YEAH, ALL I NEED IS A DRESS.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.519
LENNOX, GO HOME, DIG
THROUGH MY CLOSET,

16:20.520 --> 16:22.311
AND FIND SOMETHING
THAT GOES WITH A CAST.

16:22.312 --> 16:25.154
YOU REALLY NEED A DRESS? OF
COURSE YOU NEED A DRESS.

16:25.155 --> 16:26.275
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.776
- GET A DRESS, WOULD YOU?
- OKAY.

16:27.777 --> 16:29.318
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.111
REALLY?

16:33.073 --> 16:34.953
LENNOX, LISTEN, UM...

16:34.954 --> 16:37.036
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHEN WE
WE'RE GONNA TELL EVERYBODY

16:37.037 --> 16:39.288
THE BIG NEWS THAT WE'RE
AN OFFICIAL COUPLE?

16:39.289 --> 16:41.420
OH! UM, I... I...

16:41.421 --> 16:44.333
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD STEAL
MEL AND JOE'S THUNDER.

16:44.334 --> 16:46.295
TODAY'S KIND OF THEIR BIG DAY.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.257
FAIR ENOUGH. BUT
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

16:48.258 --> 16:49.718
I CANCELLED MY RETURN FLIGHT.

16:49.719 --> 16:52.051
TO NEW JERSEY?

16:52.052 --> 16:54.303
WHERE YOU LIVE?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.845
WE DON'T HAVE TO RUSH TO GET
OUR OWN APARTMENT OR ANYTHING.

16:56.846 --> 16:58.267
- NOT RIGHT AWAY.
- OH! ( laughs )

16:58.268 --> 16:59.478
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

16:59.479 --> 17:00.689
WELL, I GOT TO GO
GET MEL'S DRESS.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.851
- DO YOU WANT ME TO COME WITH...
- NO!

17:02.852 --> 17:05.564
THIS IS A JOB FOR
BRIDESMAIDS ONLY.

17:05.565 --> 17:07.236
OKAY, WHEN YOU GET BACK,

17:07.237 --> 17:08.407
YOU'LL TELL ME WHICH
ONE YOU LIKE BEST.

17:08.408 --> 17:10.779
- LEFT OR RIGHT?
- FOR WHAT?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.451
YOUR NAME.
