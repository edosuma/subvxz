Sub By Black Hawk

02:58.310 --> 02:59.310
You sterile?

03:01.313 --> 03:02.482
Sick maybe?

03:03.682 --> 03:06.952
Come on, a guy like you,
still around?

03:06.986 --> 03:08.221
Something's wrong.

03:12.825 --> 03:13.959
Nothing's wrong with me.

03:17.563 --> 03:19.798
Hey, you heading to the city?

03:19.832 --> 03:21.267
Not that far south, man.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.936
How far? Hey, hey, hey!

03:23.969 --> 03:24.969
Hey!

03:39.885 --> 03:41.221
Open the front pocket.

03:42.921 --> 03:43.921
Open it.

03:45.457 --> 03:46.457
Reach in.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.397
Congratulations.
You can have it.

03:52.931 --> 03:54.367
The bag stays here.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.871
You're not taking the bag.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.041
<i>Why are we even debating this?</i>

04:26.065 --> 04:28.868
<i>Of course the senate
should re-authorize the OEE.</i>

04:28.901 --> 04:32.838
<i>Look at the economy, 72 quarters
in a row of recession.</i>

04:32.871 --> 04:34.472
<i>Look at the climate.</i>

04:34.506 --> 04:36.384
<i>You know, one third
of the land of this country</i>

04:36.408 --> 04:38.578
<i>is now scientifically
categorized as desert.</i>

04:39.044 --> 04:41.414
<i>Or crime, gun homicides
are up almost what,</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.449
<i>forty percent
in the last ten years?</i>

04:43.482 --> 04:44.784
<i>There's not enough jobs,</i>

04:44.817 --> 04:45.985
<i>there's not enough land</i>

04:46.018 --> 04:47.520
<i>and not enough clean water.</i>

04:47.553 --> 04:49.522
<i>And all that will be worse</i>

04:49.555 --> 04:52.058
<i>if that 15% of the population
was still down here.</i>

04:52.091 --> 04:53.835
<i>Even if we take Larry's view,</i>

04:53.859 --> 04:55.895
<i>that would only be
if it was unbiased.</i>

04:55.928 --> 04:58.564
<i>You know, a random selection
of people getting to leave.</i>

04:58.597 --> 05:02.034
<i>If that 15% was a few
of everyone, fine, but it's not.</i>

05:02.067 --> 05:04.770
<i>It's the majority of the people
with the most education,</i>

05:04.803 --> 05:06.872
<i>the most skilled,
the most money.</i>

05:06.905 --> 05:09.342
<i>And to say that what's left
down here is better off</i>

05:09.375 --> 05:11.878
<i>is not just untrue,
it is disgusting.</i>

05:22.721 --> 05:24.390
Why you heading to I., man?

05:25.524 --> 05:26.625
What's that?

05:26.658 --> 05:28.058
Why you heading to I., man?

05:29.094 --> 05:30.430
I'm...

05:31.029 --> 05:32.531
going home.

05:32.564 --> 05:33.699
What?

05:33.732 --> 05:35.534
Coming home.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.479
Sorry, sir. What?

05:38.537 --> 05:42.474
I'm just, uh, just...

05:42.508 --> 05:43.508
Just on my way.

07:05.858 --> 07:06.926
Is Vanessa here?

07:08.193 --> 07:09.462
Vanessa?

07:15.668 --> 07:17.148
What... what are
you doing here?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.207
Just looking for Vanessa.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.777
I don't know where she is,

07:25.811 --> 07:27.580
and I wouldn't
fucking help you if I could.

07:44.830 --> 07:48.834

<i>Now serving G-0-1-4...</i>

08:35.681 --> 08:37.982
We take that info
from your original application.

08:38.015 --> 08:41.020
I think maybe my wife
submitted a change for us,

08:41.053 --> 08:42.130
and I just wanted to make sure.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.188
Information changes
are window 21-A.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.658
No, I don't need to change it.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.727
I just wanted to know
if we did change it.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.004
- And what are you waiting on?
- Papers and stuff.

08:50.028 --> 08:51.873
You received
your letter of notification?

08:51.897 --> 08:53.900
- Yes.
- Then you have a visa.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.902
But can you look up
if we changed our address

08:57.936 --> 08:59.772
after the notification letter
was mailed?

08:59.805 --> 09:03.608
Whatever address the letter was
forwarded to is the one we have.

09:03.642 --> 09:05.277
There are no other mailings
after that.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.045
Your information is locked.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.180
Just show up at departure.

09:09.214 --> 09:11.917
Okay, we need an extension
on our launch date.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.286
On the counter
to your left, the blue form.

09:14.319 --> 09:16.221
You need a signature
from your Congressman

09:16.254 --> 09:18.857
or, if you live in a district
under Federal supervision,

09:18.890 --> 09:20.259
a consent decree manager.

09:20.292 --> 09:22.795
Get new DNA
and blood verification

09:22.828 --> 09:25.997
from an approved vendor and turn
it all into window number six

09:26.031 --> 09:28.601
at least two weeks before
your original launch date.

09:28.634 --> 09:29.935
I don't have time for that.

09:29.968 --> 09:31.637
My launch is on Friday.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.306
This Friday, in four days?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.652
Is there any way we can swap
with another couple that needs...

09:37.676 --> 09:38.611
That wants to leave early?

09:38.644 --> 09:40.779
No,
unless you and your wife show up

09:40.812 --> 09:43.115
before cut-off on Friday,
that's it.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.617
You lose the visa.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.188
Can you just look up my...

09:49.221 --> 09:50.221
Where is your wife?

09:51.089 --> 09:53.692
- She went for a walk.
- Outside?

09:53.725 --> 09:55.403
Cause she can't get back
in without that letter.

09:55.427 --> 09:57.029
No, she just went
to the bathroom.

09:59.031 --> 10:02.101
If she's pregnant, you're
not gonna get past departure.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.637
Just get rid of it
and do it again up there.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.214
That's the whole reason
you have to be married

10:06.238 --> 10:07.873
before going
to the colonies anyway.

10:07.906 --> 10:09.809
She's not pregnant. I just...

10:10.776 --> 10:13.344
Look, there's gotta be some way
to get a little more time.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.781
Why were you asking me
about your address?

10:18.450 --> 10:19.652
What was your last name?

10:23.722 --> 10:25.790
Can I see the letter
of notification?

10:25.824 --> 10:26.657
I'm sure I can look up

10:26.692 --> 10:28.294
the information
you wanted from that.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
Forget it.

10:38.003 --> 10:39.003
Next.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.796
We wanna buy your visa.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.232
Hi.

11:09.034 --> 11:11.036
We were out there, um...

11:11.069 --> 11:14.173
I saw that you're not
with your wife.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.043
Um, is she sick?

11:17.509 --> 11:20.779
Or are you guys
splitting up or something?

11:20.812 --> 11:24.383
We've got cash, a car,
whatever else you want.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.152
We know a guy, a med student.

11:27.185 --> 11:28.786
He does it on the side
at a school.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.922
It's totally safe.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.124
The finger, DNA, all of it.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.726
We're good people.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.461
We're very good people.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.230
It wouldn't be wasted on us.

11:38.263 --> 11:40.032
Your departure's soon, right?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.434
You could give it to us.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.745
It would really, really help us.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.237
The visa's not for sale.

11:45.937 --> 11:48.040
- But...
- Whatever you want.

11:48.073 --> 11:51.076
We have stuff, you know.
We have...

11:51.109 --> 11:52.911
We've done everything right
and we're never...

11:52.944 --> 11:55.247
At least call your wife
and just ask her.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.415
Please, please don't waste it.

11:58.817 --> 11:59.819
I'm sorry.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.190
Maybe I could do
something for you.

12:06.391 --> 12:07.959
We could go somewhere.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.273
Hey, hey, no.
You can't be back here, man.

12:55.106 --> 12:56.175
I'm looking for Eric.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.577
- About what?
- I'm a friend of his.

12:58.610 --> 12:59.978
I'm a friend
of everybody,

13:00.011 --> 13:00.844
but I'm not walking...

13:00.879 --> 13:02.581
- Eric!
- Don't start fucking yelling.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.517
- I just said get out of here.
- I said I know him. Eric!

13:06.618 --> 13:07.920
You're in trouble now.

13:17.229 --> 13:18.931
It's good to see you.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.402
He come alone?

13:24.402 --> 13:25.303
I think so, I mean...

13:25.337 --> 13:26.972
What did I just
talk to you about?

13:27.572 --> 13:29.107
He said he was your friend.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.660
Go see if anybody else is there.

13:31.409 --> 13:33.212
Fucking do your job.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.447
- Hey, Rondo!
- Yeah!

13:35.480 --> 13:36.916
Check out back.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.020
No, there's nobody.

13:52.497 --> 13:53.498
Lock the gate.

13:59.671 --> 14:00.973
Hey, Jack.

14:06.678 --> 14:07.678
What's up?

14:08.547 --> 14:10.227
- Came to ask...
- Shut the fuck up.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.386
What?

14:16.922 --> 14:18.090
What do you wanna say to me?

14:18.123 --> 14:19.425
Came to ask a favor.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.228
- Hmm.
- I'm looking for Vanessa.

14:23.261 --> 14:24.261
Who's Vanessa?

14:25.597 --> 14:26.597
His wife.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.479
What happened to your wife?

14:30.969 --> 14:32.371
What happened
to your wife, Jack?

14:35.707 --> 14:37.009
Can you help me find her?

14:38.009 --> 14:39.077
What do you want with her?

14:39.110 --> 14:40.246
Come on, Eric.

14:43.548 --> 14:45.651
- Eric!
- You think I owe you something?

14:45.684 --> 14:48.254
You think
I fucking owe you something?

14:53.024 --> 14:54.126
Don't come back here.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.233
Eric.

15:26.992 --> 15:27.992
You're back.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.362
Hey, Lexi.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.165
You wanna grab a drink?

15:34.265 --> 15:35.634
I'm looking for my wife.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.673
Nobody has seen Vanessa.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.080
Have you seen Morgan?

15:48.113 --> 15:50.582
I think they were
at Faith's mom's old place

15:50.615 --> 15:52.117
by the Pasadena sign.

15:54.052 --> 15:55.620
They might have
gotten evicted by now.

15:55.653 --> 15:57.255
I don't know.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.288
Thanks.

15:59.424 --> 16:00.659
You can crash with me.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.195
The train's not running.

16:04.429 --> 16:06.999
- I got a place to stay.
- Mine's better.

16:12.470 --> 16:13.706
I'll see you, Lexi.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.322
Hey.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.527
Good to see you, Morgan.

17:21.271 --> 17:22.106
So Emilio.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.675
He and his wife
rent out our back room.

17:23.708 --> 17:24.742
Hello.

17:30.782 --> 17:32.818
Bottled water is
not really in our budget.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.356
I've got beer, soda.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.727
Soda? Please.

17:50.635 --> 17:51.703
Thanks.

17:58.543 --> 18:00.079
How'd you...

18:01.446 --> 18:02.747
How'd you know we were here?

18:04.315 --> 18:05.317
Lexi.

18:08.453 --> 18:10.322
Do you know where Vanessa is?

18:18.163 --> 18:20.199
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Faith.

18:22.534 --> 18:23.635
He just showed up.

18:26.938 --> 18:28.140
What are you doing here?

18:31.709 --> 18:34.313
Look, I really need
to find Vanessa.

18:35.847 --> 18:37.516
Our visa came through.

18:38.816 --> 18:41.486
It's an A-3,
anywhere except Luna,

18:41.519 --> 18:42.721
guaranteed the homestead.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.356
Problem is
we only have three days.

18:48.459 --> 18:50.262
It's a little tough to hear,
don't you think?

18:52.363 --> 18:53.574
Yours could still come through.

18:53.598 --> 18:55.267
What?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.735
We applied
two years before you did.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.547
All right? They're not
giving them to couples like us.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.173
They say it's an open lottery.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.608
Yeah, that's fucking stupid.

19:04.342 --> 19:06.311
Look, I'm just saying,
don't give up.

19:06.344 --> 19:07.713
We're having a baby.

19:10.381 --> 19:12.184
Yeah.

19:12.217 --> 19:13.418
We waited eight years.

19:14.719 --> 19:15.820
And if we weren't careful,

19:15.853 --> 19:17.322
we were gonna wait
another eight.

19:18.356 --> 19:19.767
- Yeah, but...
- What's wrong with you, Jack?

19:19.791 --> 19:21.393
Do you think
we wanna raise a kid here?

19:22.527 --> 19:23.762
Look, look out, man.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.330
There's three buildings

19:25.363 --> 19:26.831
on this block alone
are abandoned.

19:26.864 --> 19:28.704
You can't even drink the water
out of the pipes

19:28.733 --> 19:30.534
'cause the city's in bankruptcy.

19:30.568 --> 19:32.404
Faith and I,
we had to be honest.

19:32.437 --> 19:33.604
It wasn't gonna happen.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.341
Okay? We need to make it here

19:37.375 --> 19:39.244
and we've been building
our life right here.

19:39.277 --> 19:42.948
And then you
fucking show up with a visa!

19:44.716 --> 19:46.318
You, Jack!

19:47.986 --> 19:50.455
We're happy to see you,
we really are.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.396
Would you cut us
some fucking slack?

20:15.046 --> 20:17.415
Are you still
working construction?

20:17.448 --> 20:18.817
Nah.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.653
Nobody's building
in I. County anymore.

20:21.686 --> 20:23.855
I'm working
recycling and salvage.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.361
- You want an apple?
- Thanks.

20:44.475 --> 20:45.776
Where've you been Jack?

20:49.847 --> 20:51.983
I've been up in Yukon,

20:52.016 --> 20:53.418
mining mostly.

20:54.085 --> 20:55.820
Coltan,

20:55.853 --> 20:57.822
rhodium, a bunch of rare earths.

20:57.855 --> 20:59.358
So, you just left.

21:02.460 --> 21:03.462
I just left.

21:14.472 --> 21:16.592
<i>I stood up for you
for two whole years, man.</i>

21:17.375 --> 21:18.810
<i>Defending you.</i>

21:18.843 --> 21:20.412
<i>That was a stupid thing to do.</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:21.845
<i>Yeah, like it probably was.</i>

21:22.814 --> 21:24.916
<i>I kept saying,</i>

21:24.949 --> 21:28.987
<i>"Jack would never
have just walked off like that.</i>

21:29.754 --> 21:30.956
<i>Surely he must be dead."</i>

21:33.958 --> 21:34.993
Well, I'm back.

21:38.763 --> 21:39.763
Okay.

21:40.565 --> 21:41.967
You really don't know
where she is?

21:43.568 --> 21:44.569
No.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.706
You think Eric would know?

21:49.941 --> 21:51.943
- Do not go see him.
- Would he know?

21:53.911 --> 21:55.814
You left them on the hook
for the Alvarado crew.

21:56.481 --> 21:57.481
It went bad.

21:58.116 --> 21:59.783
They held him for a week.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.453
He killed four of their guys...

22:03.788 --> 22:06.992
With an axe handle to get out.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.395
<i>You wanna go see him for me?</i>

22:20.171 --> 22:21.473
I gotta find her.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.765
You just stay here
for a couple of days, man.

22:31.883 --> 22:33.685
You can...
You can crash on the couch.

22:59.977 --> 23:01.646
That's a little bit creepy,
Faith.

23:03.915 --> 23:06.151
Feels very strange
to be back here.

23:06.184 --> 23:07.786
I want you out of my house.

23:09.954 --> 23:11.188
You've hurt too many people

23:11.222 --> 23:14.793
and you have
this gem of a new life.

23:17.728 --> 23:19.398
And you crushed her.

23:24.802 --> 23:26.504
And you wanna find her again.

23:30.241 --> 23:31.241
In...

23:33.478 --> 23:34.478
It doesn't matter.

23:34.979 --> 23:36.681
You know,
we did everything right.

23:36.714 --> 23:38.884
Morgan stayed.
He stopped working with Eric.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.120
And we have to be here
and you... you get to...

23:42.153 --> 23:43.422
I'm sorry.

23:48.125 --> 23:49.861
All I know
is you guys deserve it.

23:52.763 --> 23:54.433
Faith, I'll tell you
what I've learned.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.802
This whole place
is a stinking hell.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.704
And I wasn't coming back

23:59.737 --> 24:01.906
until I could get out of here
with Vanessa.

24:01.939 --> 24:03.074
And now I can.

24:06.677 --> 24:08.037
And I'm gonna try
to make it right.

24:11.282 --> 24:12.650
This is all I've got.

24:20.057 --> 24:21.726
Starbrite?

24:21.759 --> 24:23.203
She lived there
for a little while

24:23.227 --> 24:24.863
after she lost the house.

24:24.896 --> 24:25.897
Why?

24:27.231 --> 24:29.067
I used to go there
with somebody else.

24:32.703 --> 24:33.972
You so don't deserve it.

24:50.088 --> 24:53.558
<i>Hey. Is there
a Vanessa Elton staying here?</i>

24:54.025 --> 24:55.093
- <i>What?</i>

24:55.126 --> 24:56.561
<i>Vanessa Elton.</i>

24:56.594 --> 24:57.695
<i>Does she have a room here?</i>

24:57.729 --> 24:59.106
<i>Yeah, you gotta bring
your own girl in.</i>

24:59.130 --> 25:00.064
<i>There's no hookers here.</i>

25:01.899 --> 25:03.568
<i>No, she's blonde,
about this tall.</i>

25:03.601 --> 25:05.803
<i>They aren't any chicks
staying here, man.</i>

25:05.836 --> 25:07.147
<i>Can you just check your records?</i>

25:07.171 --> 25:08.773
<i>Maybe, I don't know,
figure it out?</i>

25:08.806 --> 25:10.742
<i>Check what?
I don't write down names.</i>

25:10.775 --> 25:12.877
<i>All right. All right.
Just give me a room.</i>

25:12.910 --> 25:14.779
<i>You want a single
or a double?</i>

25:14.812 --> 25:16.313
<i>You got 207?</i>

25:16.347 --> 25:17.649
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

27:21.472 --> 27:22.674
Lexi.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.240
Hi.

27:31.949 --> 27:33.184
You coming in?

28:05.416 --> 28:07.418
You should have told me
you were going to be here.

28:14.959 --> 28:17.062
You're so stubborn sometimes.

29:17.188 --> 29:18.188
How old are these?

29:19.056 --> 29:20.433
Guaranteed to work
or your money back.

29:20.457 --> 29:22.393
- How much?
- Earth plus up there?

29:23.327 --> 29:24.327
Fifty.

29:27.064 --> 29:28.433
I only need here.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.770
For only a little bit
more, you get all 17.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.117
Don't know anyone up there.

29:44.081 --> 29:45.081
Twenty.

29:59.496 --> 30:01.366
That's the best deal
I ever made.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.846
Jack Chaney?

30:18.215 --> 30:19.216
Do I know you?

30:25.356 --> 30:26.556
Come on, you know you miss it.

30:27.558 --> 30:29.027
Everybody misses it.

30:30.261 --> 30:33.030
I can't think of one person
who does... who hasn't told me.

30:33.063 --> 30:36.000
Like, if you ask them,
personally,

30:37.067 --> 30:39.904
in their home or something,
they'll tell you they miss it.

30:43.374 --> 30:46.143
Top three things
that everyone misses.

30:46.176 --> 30:48.946
Number three, credit cards.

30:48.979 --> 30:54.118
Two, the internet.
They miss pornography!

30:54.151 --> 30:57.521
And number one, I scream,
you scream, we all scream...

30:57.554 --> 30:59.157
Please stop talking.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.226
Go lock up.

32:27.044 --> 32:29.147
Rocky Road was my favorite.

32:30.514 --> 32:32.248
What the fuck is Rocky Road?

32:32.282 --> 32:34.118
It had nuts and marshmallows.

32:35.686 --> 32:37.355
Well, screw that.

32:52.202 --> 32:54.005
You think I wouldn't find out?

32:55.806 --> 32:56.841
About what?

32:59.376 --> 33:02.213
You went to Pasadena.
You got Morgan on your side.

33:03.213 --> 33:04.047
Who else?

33:04.081 --> 33:06.016
I'm not making a move on you,
Eric.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.451
I'm looking for my wife.

33:07.484 --> 33:08.485
Tell me why.

33:10.254 --> 33:11.356
She's my wife.

33:12.456 --> 33:13.456
Oh.

33:14.224 --> 33:15.226
Okay.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.589
Leave the city now, or pay up.

33:47.825 --> 33:49.794
I'm not here to dig up the past.

33:50.427 --> 33:53.097
I lost a lot because of you.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.701
You leave or you pay up.

34:00.237 --> 34:01.272
I don't work for you.

34:07.678 --> 34:09.246
She cut her hair.

34:18.655 --> 34:19.857
You know where she is?

34:19.889 --> 34:22.125
- Yeah.
- Tell me.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.395
I have a big job to do.

34:24.428 --> 34:26.429
Impossible for us,

34:26.463 --> 34:29.634
but you could change that.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.502
No.

34:31.534 --> 34:32.670
You do the job,

34:32.703 --> 34:33.703
I'll take you to her.

34:34.638 --> 34:37.074
- I'll find her without you.
- No, you won't.

34:39.443 --> 34:41.478
So...

34:41.512 --> 34:43.380
Ask me about the job.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.510
<i>Please move along.
There is no public access.</i>

35:14.278 --> 35:16.346
Tell Carrington,
Jack Chaney is here to see him.

35:18.715 --> 35:20.518
<i>Step back from the gate.</i>

35:21.919 --> 35:24.187
Tell him Jack Chaney.

35:55.852 --> 35:56.963
<i>Do you mind if I ask</i>

35:56.987 --> 35:59.190
<i>how you know the administrator?</i>

35:59.223 --> 36:00.591
<i>Carrington?</i>

36:01.358 --> 36:03.628
<i>He and my sister
knew each other.</i>

36:04.795 --> 36:06.435
<i>Not that many people
get in here.</i>

36:53.277 --> 36:55.279
Jonathan Chaney.

36:55.312 --> 36:56.480
Back in the big city.

36:58.615 --> 37:01.452
And you're still
the company man.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.455
The company man.

37:06.323 --> 37:07.634
Well, they can't trust
just anybody

37:07.658 --> 37:08.959
to look after things down here.

37:08.992 --> 37:10.861
They trust you.

37:10.894 --> 37:12.562
They do.

37:12.596 --> 37:14.431
- Imagine that.
- Imagine that.

37:16.633 --> 37:17.835
How's it going?

37:17.868 --> 37:19.870
Raw materials flat,

37:19.903 --> 37:21.605
expansion is almost done,

37:21.638 --> 37:23.406
energy is booming.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.644
Calisto 3 has a pH problem
in their culture pool.

37:26.677 --> 37:28.412
Almost had to do
rolling blackouts

37:28.445 --> 37:29.922
and they're paying
through their teeth

37:29.946 --> 37:31.582
for an extra shipment
from down here.

37:31.615 --> 37:33.049
Yeah, I get it.
You're doing great.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.083
Yeah.

37:35.986 --> 37:36.986
Why are you here?

37:37.888 --> 37:39.688
- I got a visa.
- You got a visa.

37:39.823 --> 37:41.625
- Yeah.
- You got a visa.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.594
What are you gonna do
with that visa?

37:43.627 --> 37:46.564
- Use it.
- Easier than ever to sell.

37:47.431 --> 37:50.735
Just the DNA match at launch,
everything's offline.

37:51.468 --> 37:52.979
They're not even using pictures
anymore.

37:53.003 --> 37:55.706
You can hold a lot of cash
with four and a half fingers.

37:55.739 --> 37:57.742
- Yeah, I could.
- Yeah.

37:58.642 --> 38:00.410
I'm using the visa.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.681
Congratulations.

38:05.549 --> 38:06.751
When do you leave?

38:08.885 --> 38:10.054
Friday.

38:10.087 --> 38:11.322
Out of Chellis?

38:11.355 --> 38:12.023
Mm-hmm.

38:12.056 --> 38:13.391
That's one of ours.

38:14.658 --> 38:17.728
OEE has been leasing space on
top of our shipments for months.

38:17.761 --> 38:20.064
Not too many things
get by us anymore.

38:20.097 --> 38:23.734
I don't give a shit
about your business bullshit.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.337
I, uh...

38:30.507 --> 38:32.109
I got two days

38:32.142 --> 38:34.444
and I can't find Vanessa.

38:35.846 --> 38:37.548
I don't know where she is.

38:39.716 --> 38:41.676
I wouldn't expect you
to know where she is.

38:42.552 --> 38:43.821
But... But you can help me.

38:45.389 --> 38:46.424
Right?

38:49.059 --> 38:50.528
I need you

38:52.028 --> 38:53.464
to help me find her.

38:55.132 --> 38:57.101
How many times
are you gonna do this to me?

38:57.134 --> 38:58.836
Just once more
and then I'm gone.

39:00.637 --> 39:03.374
I think about your sister
every day.

39:05.075 --> 39:06.577
And I can't undo it.

39:07.043 --> 39:08.612
Which is why...

39:10.180 --> 39:11.749
you're going to help me do this.

39:18.855 --> 39:20.457
We're like everybody else.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.691
No external network.

39:21.725 --> 39:24.962
I got guys running Infostix
across town four times a day.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.763
If she was involved
in our business,

39:26.797 --> 39:28.165
down here in any way,

39:28.198 --> 39:30.000
if she worked
at one of our facilities,

39:30.033 --> 39:31.402
I'd know.

39:32.569 --> 39:34.738
But outside of that,

39:34.771 --> 39:36.107
they don't care about it.

39:37.607 --> 39:38.942
So, I don't care about it

39:38.975 --> 39:41.145
and I have no way
of knowing about it.

39:44.481 --> 39:45.916
You have no way
of knowing about it?

39:48.084 --> 39:49.419
No one you could call?

39:59.763 --> 40:00.596
Then I need some money.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.132
You know what?
I don't wanna stop you

40:02.165 --> 40:03.933
because I know
where you're going with this.

40:03.967 --> 40:05.769
I can't...
There's no cash for grab.

40:05.802 --> 40:07.671
Not a single cent
of hard currency.

40:07.704 --> 40:09.106
Well, how much is a bloom worth?

40:09.139 --> 40:10.474
Enough
that they can't go missing.

40:10.507 --> 40:12.209
So you're not going to help me?

40:12.242 --> 40:14.612
- My hands are tied.
- Ah. Jesus.

40:15.645 --> 40:16.714
"My hands are tied"?

40:19.683 --> 40:21.051
I wish I could help you.

40:22.919 --> 40:24.864
So that I could tell you
that I'm not gonna help you.

40:27.190 --> 40:30.628
I'm almost done flagging you
as an MC Security threat.

40:32.562 --> 40:33.529
It's our rocket.

40:33.563 --> 40:37.000
So, OEE follows our lead
on the no-launch list.

40:37.033 --> 40:37.834
What?

40:37.867 --> 40:40.103
Immediately arrested
if you set foot

40:40.136 --> 40:42.538
- near any launch site.
- Just stop.

40:42.572 --> 40:44.608
All I have to do
is push this button.

40:44.641 --> 40:46.043
Stop! I get it.

40:46.076 --> 40:47.644
I shouldn't have come at you
like this.

40:47.677 --> 40:49.046
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.051
Then say the words.

40:58.889 --> 40:59.889
It...

41:01.591 --> 41:02.893
It wasn't your fault?

41:05.061 --> 41:06.341
Is that what you want me to say?

41:08.598 --> 41:09.598
Last chance.

41:13.737 --> 41:14.872
It wasn't your fault.

41:17.707 --> 41:19.542
Nicky loved you.

41:19.576 --> 41:20.744
You loved her.

41:24.681 --> 41:25.683
I forgive you.

41:30.253 --> 41:31.253
Again.

41:34.624 --> 41:35.993
It wasn't your fault.

41:38.862 --> 41:39.930
She loved you.

41:39.963 --> 41:41.565
You loved her.

41:41.598 --> 41:42.633
I forgive you.

41:47.771 --> 41:48.906
I forgive you.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.020
Accepted.

42:09.926 --> 42:11.194
Why did you ask me for money?

42:14.698 --> 42:15.732
I owe someone.

42:17.033 --> 42:19.169
He's the only one
who knows where Vanessa is.

42:27.010 --> 42:28.278
You never had any problem

42:28.311 --> 42:30.247
finding a scheme for cash
before.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.649
Why now?

42:33.750 --> 42:35.686
I don't wanna be
that guy anymore.

42:53.236 --> 42:54.337
<i>How did it go?</i>

42:54.371 --> 42:56.640
It's in place. When do we start?

42:56.673 --> 42:59.142
<i>Felt good, right?
Back in the saddle.</i>

42:59.175 --> 43:00.644
When do we start?

43:00.677 --> 43:02.145
<i>Tomorrow morning.</i>

43:02.178 --> 43:03.580
<i>Have a good night, Jack.</i>

43:32.342 --> 43:34.044
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is Lexi there?

44:09.279 --> 44:11.148
<i>This is one night when I...</i>

44:16.419 --> 44:18.087
<i>I couldn't get to sleep</i>

44:20.256 --> 44:24.060
<i>because anything
that was touching me</i>

44:24.094 --> 44:25.829
<i>felt like,</i>

44:25.862 --> 44:27.364
<i>you know,
one of those lead blankets.</i>

44:28.331 --> 44:31.201
<i>And I got up
and I went outside and...</i>

44:31.234 --> 44:33.170
<i>I don't know,
the whole night felt that way.</i>

44:35.739 --> 44:37.539
<i>I could tell you
a million stories like that.</i>

44:39.175 --> 44:41.412
<i>But I couldn't tell you
why I left.</i>

44:46.983 --> 44:50.921
<i>It's like there's no chance
anymore.</i>

44:50.954 --> 44:52.422
<i>That we don't have the same
chance</i>

44:52.455 --> 44:53.857
<i>and there's nothing</i>

44:54.824 --> 44:55.993
<i>out there.</i>

44:59.295 --> 45:00.998
I didn't find anything
out there.

45:05.869 --> 45:06.970
<i>That's what I want.</i>

45:08.438 --> 45:10.474
<i>I want a chance
to have something.</i>

45:13.810 --> 45:15.145
Remember those old stories

45:18.815 --> 45:20.417
about the guys that'd go west?

45:23.887 --> 45:25.455
They'd just be able
to have that land.

45:25.488 --> 45:27.223
Jack, stop.

45:31.961 --> 45:33.930
<i>I wanna be better
than who I was.</i>

46:32.455 --> 46:34.458
Hey. Wakey, wakey.

46:35.491 --> 46:37.651
So, we're on for tomorrow.
We gotta pick up some stuff.

46:38.228 --> 46:39.228
Okay.

48:09.519 --> 48:10.988
You worried about Jack?

48:13.156 --> 48:14.156
Well, you should be.

48:15.291 --> 48:16.593
He has a debt to pay.

48:18.094 --> 48:19.094
This job

48:20.463 --> 48:21.531
is not safe.

48:22.632 --> 48:23.634
And...

48:24.400 --> 48:26.403
I am me.

48:26.436 --> 48:28.138
But Jack is Jack.

48:28.171 --> 48:29.638
He should be fine, then.

48:29.672 --> 48:32.609
Unless you think
he's lost a step.

48:32.642 --> 48:36.212
Whatever he owes you,
I got it covered.

48:41.351 --> 48:42.686
Might cost more than you think.

48:45.388 --> 48:46.556
I'm not gonna fuck you.

48:47.523 --> 48:49.092
Just name your price.

48:51.728 --> 48:53.396
You think this is business?

48:53.429 --> 48:55.298
You're not gonna fuck me?

48:55.331 --> 48:56.666
What if I fuck you?

48:56.699 --> 48:58.068
He owes me!

49:00.370 --> 49:01.404
How much?

49:09.212 --> 49:10.212
How much?

49:11.214 --> 49:12.282
What's in the bag?

49:23.559 --> 49:24.594
Huh.

49:28.364 --> 49:30.000
You've been saving for a while.

49:30.033 --> 49:31.468
It's almost a hundred gallons.

49:32.135 --> 49:33.135
What's it for?

49:34.404 --> 49:36.106
I don't want you
to ever bother us again.

49:36.139 --> 49:38.074
What were you saving it for?

49:38.107 --> 49:39.184
Does it really fucking matter?

49:39.208 --> 49:40.344
Then it's not enough.

49:43.179 --> 49:45.148
I was going to open up
my own bar.

49:46.649 --> 49:48.250
Thought we almost had it.

49:54.791 --> 49:56.193
You tell Jack

49:57.760 --> 49:59.396
his debt is settled.

50:35.498 --> 50:37.133
What are you doing here?

50:37.166 --> 50:38.686
Why would you work
for that guy?

50:40.236 --> 50:41.971
It's just one job.
Don't worry about it.

50:45.842 --> 50:48.278
- I owe him.
- I took care of that.

50:49.312 --> 50:51.448
- What?
- We settled it.

50:52.482 --> 50:53.683
You're free and clear.

50:55.518 --> 50:56.653
Why would you do that?

50:58.254 --> 50:59.721
I didn't ask you to do that.

51:01.257 --> 51:02.826
I have to do the job.

51:03.526 --> 51:04.526
Why?

51:09.632 --> 51:11.268
He knows where Vanessa is.

51:18.174 --> 51:19.409
I was here Jack.

51:22.311 --> 51:23.447
You remember that.

52:00.516 --> 52:01.651
Okay.

52:09.825 --> 52:11.495
Oh, wow.

52:18.968 --> 52:20.604
Bring him back alive.

52:22.205 --> 52:25.208
He's annoying, but useful.

52:26.909 --> 52:28.245
No one's gonna get hurt.

52:30.746 --> 52:32.782
Whatever Lexi paid you,
give it back.

52:32.815 --> 52:34.351
She made a deal.

52:35.551 --> 52:36.653
I'm doing the job.

52:37.620 --> 52:40.423
It pays my debt.
I don't want her involved.

52:40.456 --> 52:41.456
Too late.

52:43.226 --> 52:45.395
You're lucky I know Carrington.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.330
You got anybody else
that could pull this off?

52:48.297 --> 52:50.700
Do you know anybody
who knows where Vanessa is?

52:57.240 --> 53:00.676
Okay, so, I got us

53:00.710 --> 53:04.647
a couple of cutie-beauties.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.816
Check that shit out.
Check it out.

53:09.418 --> 53:10.921
- Here.
- No.

53:11.621 --> 53:12.789
Hmm...

53:12.822 --> 53:14.958
Uh, yes.

53:15.625 --> 53:16.626
No.

53:18.527 --> 53:20.496
Okay, let me just
jump through this here.

53:20.529 --> 53:23.266
No, yes. No, yes.
No, yes. No, yes.

53:23.299 --> 53:25.835
Hmm... Buzz, time's up. Yes.

53:25.868 --> 53:27.437
You never had a problem before.

53:28.537 --> 53:29.537
I'm not killing people.

53:31.407 --> 53:32.718
Just shooting them.
No, come on...

53:32.742 --> 53:33.877
Hey.

53:36.312 --> 53:38.647
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

53:40.850 --> 53:42.685
Go help Rondo with the van.

53:56.365 --> 53:57.734
I'm gonna do this my way.

54:02.972 --> 54:05.275
Things always work out
the way you want?

54:12.515 --> 54:15.018
Why is this fucking bag
so heavy?

54:17.953 --> 54:20.423
God!

54:22.825 --> 54:23.993
Keep going.

54:27.697 --> 54:30.633
We should have quit
when the cart broke.

54:33.369 --> 54:34.637
Just keep going.

54:34.670 --> 54:36.072
Let's go.
Keep going. Keep going.

54:41.444 --> 54:43.346
Fuck. No. Fuck this.

54:43.379 --> 54:44.447
- Hey.
- Fuck.

54:45.548 --> 54:47.950
I will make sure Eric knows
you blew this for him.

54:47.983 --> 54:51.288
He will feed you to his dogs.
Now, get back here.

54:54.790 --> 54:55.958
Fuck you!

54:55.991 --> 54:57.560
Fuck you! Fuck your mother!

54:57.593 --> 54:59.495
Let's fucking go!

54:59.528 --> 55:01.464
You push.

55:01.497 --> 55:02.799
Push.

55:53.849 --> 55:55.051
You did it.

55:56.752 --> 55:57.754
Yeah.

55:59.955 --> 56:02.959
So now you tell me
that you got the Helix.

56:10.199 --> 56:12.435
And you remind me

56:14.437 --> 56:16.906
the whole bloom
degrades in three to four days.

56:17.973 --> 56:19.642
I won't have any more leverage.

56:22.578 --> 56:24.581
Probably get ugly.

56:31.053 --> 56:32.689
Let's just skip all that.

56:34.523 --> 56:35.892
Take me to her.

56:36.759 --> 56:38.461
As soon as I see her...

56:40.896 --> 56:42.296
I'll tell you
where the Helix is.

56:42.965 --> 56:44.033
Word is bond?

56:45.634 --> 56:46.836
Word is bond.

56:47.736 --> 56:48.805
All right.

57:27.776 --> 57:31.080
Hey, you know, I used to have
a parakeet named Vanessa.

57:31.113 --> 57:32.549
I mean, a lorikeet.

57:34.583 --> 57:35.651
What the fuck?

57:37.586 --> 57:38.897
What the fuck
is wrong with you,

57:38.921 --> 57:40.589
you fucking psychotic?

57:40.623 --> 57:41.591
I fucking hate you.

57:43.859 --> 57:45.728
I think I hurt his feelings.

57:45.761 --> 57:48.898
Ah, ah, that's a lot of blood.

57:49.598 --> 57:50.900
That's all my blood.

57:50.933 --> 57:52.969
You're lucky
he didn't head-butt you.

57:56.739 --> 57:57.840
What was that guy's name?

57:57.873 --> 57:59.876
That was the bike mechanic.

58:06.215 --> 58:08.651
Man, you can tell me.
Is she married?

58:08.684 --> 58:09.919
I didn't talk to her.

58:11.854 --> 58:13.622
Tsk. Just tell me.

58:13.656 --> 58:14.699
I checked to see if she was

58:14.723 --> 58:16.092
where I thought she was,
that's it.

58:17.560 --> 58:18.661
What did you see?

58:19.662 --> 58:22.698
I told you, I'd take you to her,
nothing else.

58:24.266 --> 58:25.635
She's married.

58:27.670 --> 58:28.972
Does she have any kids?

58:34.076 --> 58:35.645
Does she have any kids?

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:14.844
Don't shoot him!

01:00:44.473 --> 01:00:45.473
Hello?

01:00:46.775 --> 01:00:47.877
It's Jack, get Morgan.

01:00:48.777 --> 01:00:50.221
- Why?
<i>- Faith, I'm in trouble.</i>

01:00:50.245 --> 01:00:51.245
Just get him.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.980
I'm not gonna do that.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:56.685
Just tell him
I'm in Casitas Norte.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:59.321
<i>Eric has a squat house
somewhere near there.</i>

01:00:59.354 --> 01:01:01.424
<i>I'm to the east of it.</i>

01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:04.225
When you get it straight,
we are here for you.

01:01:04.259 --> 01:01:06.128
<i>Till then, don't call us again.</i>

01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:07.229
Faith,

01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:09.098
I... I... I need you.

01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:10.133
I...

01:01:34.423 --> 01:01:35.423
Rondo!

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.326
Ah!

01:01:40.095 --> 01:01:42.397
Hey! Hey!

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.241
Come on!

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:54.343
Come on!

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.425
That motherfucker can fight.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.403
Get him in the house.

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:59.535
Get his hand free.
We need blood flow.

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.293
Came close, Jack.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:27.363
She changed her name.

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:31.066
Has a nice house,
like, ten minutes from here...

01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:34.604
Over on Ilex by the powerlines.

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:37.272
She's gonna be surprised
to see me.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.456
Can he, like, feel shit?

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:56.125
The patch only impedes movement.

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.293
Oh.

01:05:03.398 --> 01:05:05.200
I like my nose.

01:05:05.233 --> 01:05:06.602
It's my best fucking feature.

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:09.939
Ooh!

01:05:14.576 --> 01:05:15.544
Ouch.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.552
All right, I'm ready.

01:05:24.686 --> 01:05:26.555
But I wanna see the stuff first.

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.435
It's the only thing
he takes as payment.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:44.607
What? You wanna say something?

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.248
I have... the Helix.

01:05:53.281 --> 01:05:57.486
Dude, you are old and slow.

01:05:57.519 --> 01:06:00.256
I swapped it out before we even
left the fucking fridge.

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:20.509
Wait.

01:06:23.545 --> 01:06:24.580
My wife and I...

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.214
Do you not remember me?

01:06:28.383 --> 01:06:30.785
Fuck you, Jack Chaney.

01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:32.321
Why would I help you?

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.656
Eric.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:37.159
Eric...

01:06:51.473 --> 01:06:52.675
Let me do it.

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:15.397
It's come to this.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.136
You probably
don't wanna watch this.

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:29.711
This is for everything, buddy,

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:31.614
and it's still not enough.

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:16.125
Stays self-contained and alive

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:18.694
for about 70 to 80 hours.

01:08:20.562 --> 01:08:24.366
And after that, your buyer's
blood and DNA takes over

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.303
and it's no good.

01:08:28.403 --> 01:08:29.872
Is that clear?

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:41.282
Uh, who gets to chop
off the wife's finger?

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:52.560
I'll tell her you said hi.

01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:35.636
How many out there?

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.573
I don't know. I don't know.

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:40.742
Where's my fucking gun?
Did he take my gun?

01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:42.577
Why the fuck did he take my gun?

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.747
- Where's this forger?
- He went to meet Eric.

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:46.814
Boys, hey!

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.251
Lugo!

01:09:51.853 --> 01:09:52.720
Jose!

01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.694
Leave Jack. Get the hell out.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:25.047
- I'm sorry, Morgan.
- It's done.

01:11:27.082 --> 01:11:28.850
Did you get Eric?

01:11:28.883 --> 01:11:29.985
No.

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:31.920
He wasn't here.

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:34.956
I gotta stop him.

01:12:35.717 --> 01:12:38.152
Yeah, it's all going fine.

01:12:38.186 --> 01:12:41.022
Well, I got that.
The forger already has yours.

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:42.933
And I'm gonna have
one for your wife any minute.

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:45.127
I'm just about to meet
with the woman, all right?

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.762
No, no, no. No. No.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:47.929
We're on schedule.

01:12:47.962 --> 01:12:50.766
We are on schedule, all right?

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:51.800
You...

01:15:07.802 --> 01:15:09.771
It's over. It's over, Eric.
