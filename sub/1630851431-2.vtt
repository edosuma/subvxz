WEBVTT

00:31.833 --> 00:35.250
This city has many soju brands.
Hence all these glasses.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.083
DAESUN, JOEUNDAY, C1

00:43.166 --> 00:44.708
There he is.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.083
HAEUNDAE GRILLED SEAFOOD

00:56.500 --> 00:58.208
Hi!

00:58.291 --> 00:59.875
-Have a seat.
-Nice to meet you.

00:59.958 --> 01:01.416
PAIK JONG-WON
HAN JI-MIN

01:01.500 --> 01:03.333
Did you arrive today? Just now?

01:03.416 --> 01:07.208
I left Seoul this morning
so I arrived earlier in the day.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.750
I already had milmyeon.

01:08.833 --> 01:09.708
Where at?

01:09.791 --> 01:11.125
Near Busan Station.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.416
I searched for a famous place.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.208
-You like foodie spots.
-Yes.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.000
I've actually been
to the restaurant next door.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.250
-You have?
-Yes.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.291
-When I visited with my family.
-I see.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.333
I've been to another famous one
up the street.

01:24.416 --> 01:25.541
You must be hungry.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.583
Everyone's having
the assorted grilled clams.

01:28.666 --> 01:31.500
I can honestly eat anything.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.250
-Really?
-I mean it.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.000
I don't know how to address you.

01:36.083 --> 01:36.916
FIRST TIME MEETING

01:37.000 --> 01:38.375
Seonbaenim? Mr. Paik?

01:39.458 --> 01:41.708
Actually, call me seonbaenim.

01:41.791 --> 01:44.458
-Didn't you major in social welfare?
-Yes.

01:44.541 --> 01:45.541
-So did I.
-I see.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.291
Then I'll call you seonbaenim.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.625
-Do you eat…
-Seoul Women's University?

01:49.708 --> 01:50.583
Right.

01:50.666 --> 01:52.375
We majored in the same course.

01:52.458 --> 01:53.916
-We're comrades.
-Nice.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.250
Mrs-- Wait. That's not it.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.250
Ma'am!

01:58.250 --> 01:59.208
We'll order now.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.833
-Squid hoe?
-How about the assorted grilled clams?

02:02.916 --> 02:05.541
-That's good too.
-We'll get that then.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.375
-Drinks? You can order for both of us.
-Sure.

02:08.458 --> 02:12.291
I always order Daesun when I'm in Busan.

02:12.375 --> 02:16.416
-What other soju brand is from Busan?
-Daesun and C1.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.916
C1, there's Joeunday too.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.125
-Right.
-I did their commercial.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.833
-Let's order that one.
-No, let's get Daesun.

02:22.916 --> 02:24.833
-And I--
-We'll get Daesun.

02:24.916 --> 02:27.625
-I like to start with somaek.
-We'll get some beer too.

02:27.708 --> 02:28.583
SOMAEK TYPE

02:28.666 --> 02:30.416
-You like somaek?
-Cass, please.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.541
-He's the face of the brand.
-I mean--

02:32.625 --> 02:34.416
-I like Cass.
-We don't have to.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.333
-So Daesun and Cass?
-Cass is good.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.875
I always start with somaek.

02:39.958 --> 02:42.291
You start with soju bombs. I do too.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.958
-I start with three shots of somaek.
-Great.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.041
-We're similar that way.
-Really?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.125
I start with soju bombs too.

02:49.208 --> 02:53.333
No matter who you're drinking with,
it's better to get tipsy quickly.

02:53.416 --> 02:55.166
Alcohol makes you open up.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.583
Can you drink a lot?

02:57.083 --> 02:59.083
I wouldn't say I'm a lightweight.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.625
Goodness, I feel intimidated.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.083
DAESUN, CASS

03:15.416 --> 03:19.625
DAESUN

03:48.708 --> 03:52.041
C1

03:56.875 --> 03:59.333
IPSAEJU, CASS

05:35.791 --> 05:37.916
-So I brought this.
-What's that?

05:38.916 --> 05:40.041
Guess what it is?

05:40.625 --> 05:42.166
-What's that?
-So…

05:42.250 --> 05:44.083
It's my drinking secret.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.333
I have no clue.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.958
It's milk thistle extract.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.666
-You take it before drinking?
-Right.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.416
And one more next morning.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.625
-That's how they sell it now?
-Yes.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.666
I've tried others, but this works best.

05:56.750 --> 06:00.166
-You're serious about drinking.
-I don't want you to suffer tomorrow.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.250
-Good. Let's take it now.
-Okay.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.625
Whenever I go on a family trip…

06:04.708 --> 06:06.375
My family likes to drink.

06:06.458 --> 06:09.291
My dad not so much, but my mom, my sister

06:09.375 --> 06:11.250
and her husband can drink.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.583
When my mom arrives at a restaurant,

06:13.666 --> 06:16.375
she hands out antacids for everyone.

06:16.458 --> 06:17.875
-Quite aggressive.
-Yes.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.666
So we'd take one each

06:19.750 --> 06:22.791
to chase away the alcohol from yesterday
and start anew.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.250
ALCOHOL ENTHUSIAST

06:26.500 --> 06:28.208
CHASE AWAY THE ALCOHOL FROM YESTERDAY

06:28.291 --> 06:30.791
So it's like a family ritual for drinking.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.083
TO DRINK AGAIN TODAY

06:34.833 --> 06:39.250
-Shall I? Or would you like to do it?
-You can make the first one.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.000
I'll make the next one.

06:42.708 --> 06:43.875
Do you tap the bottle?

06:45.208 --> 06:46.708
I used to, but not anymore.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.125
Like this. That hurts.

06:50.708 --> 06:51.666
-Shall I?
-Sure.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.333
How do you like your somaek?
Strong or weak?

06:54.416 --> 06:55.916
Not too much beer.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
I don't want to get full.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.541
I like to drink it in one go.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.458
Exactly.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.000
We have similar tastes.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.416
-Just up to the line.
-Perfect.

07:27.583 --> 07:30.000
-Cheers! It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.750
I love the way it goes down
on an empty stomach.

07:45.833 --> 07:46.750
Me, too.

07:49.291 --> 07:53.291
Do people in other countries
mix drinks like this too?

07:53.375 --> 07:58.625
Back when I rarely had a chance
to go abroad and didn't really know,

07:58.708 --> 08:02.750
I thought we, Koreans, liked to mix drinks
because we're so impatient.

08:02.833 --> 08:03.750
I was wrong.

08:03.833 --> 08:06.208
They do it too. You see it in movies.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.666
-They do, too?
-They do.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.791
I'm not a huge movie person,
but I'm into fishing.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.041
There's a movie
with a lot of fishing scenes

08:13.125 --> 08:16.083
called A River Runs Through It,
with Brad Pitt.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.041
There's a scene
where they drop a shot of whiskey

08:19.125 --> 08:21.125
into a glass of beer and drink it.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.291
-Really?
-Yes.

08:22.375 --> 08:26.541
And in the end,
the shot glass makes the clanking sound.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.083
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

08:28.166 --> 08:33.208
It warms you up as soon as you drink it,
kind of how a boiler works.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.416
-I see.
-Hence the name, "Boilermaker."

08:36.708 --> 08:38.666
BOILERMAKER

08:49.500 --> 08:54.083
But there are records that show
our ancestors mixed drinks too.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.708
During the Joseon dynasty

08:57.791 --> 09:00.291
people mixed makgeolli and soju.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.791
-This is diluted soju.
-Right.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.625
Have you tried Andong soju?

09:05.708 --> 09:06.625
No, I haven't.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.000
It's 40 percent ABV.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.041
-I see.
-Traditional soju contains more alcohol.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.166
That mixed with makgeolli.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.333
LIQUOR, BEER

09:18.333 --> 09:19.166
SOJU, MAKGEOLLI

09:19.250 --> 09:22.875
They drank makgeolli
mixed with traditional soju.

09:22.958 --> 09:24.666
-It must've been very strong.
-Right.

09:24.750 --> 09:28.125
Soju is 40 ABV
and makgeolli is about 11 or 12.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.458
It's stronger than our soju bomb.

09:30.541 --> 09:33.375
They called it "hondonju"
because it fuddles you.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.458
HONDONJU

09:42.750 --> 09:44.750
POUR A GLASS OF SOJU
INTO WARM MAKGEOLLI

09:44.833 --> 09:46.791
AND DRINK IT
WHEN THE SOJU FLOATS TO THE TOP

09:46.875 --> 09:47.708
THIS IS HONDONJU

09:47.791 --> 09:49.708
IF RED SOJU IS USED,
IT'S CALLED JAJUNGHONG

09:49.791 --> 09:51.791
1924
JOSEON'S BEST NEW COOKING METHOD

09:56.291 --> 09:58.375
One more? Or do you want soju?

09:58.458 --> 10:00.333
-One more, please.
-I'll make you one.

10:00.416 --> 10:03.125
Thank you.
Feel free to use your own recipe.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.208
Have you heard of "cream somaek"?

10:10.291 --> 10:11.750
-"Cream somaek"?
-Yes.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.000
No, what is it?

10:13.083 --> 10:16.208
I've broken a glass while doing it,
so I'm not too confident.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.333
-And now…
-So far, it's the same.

10:25.875 --> 10:26.708
Right.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.875
And now we make the "cream," the foam.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.208
Put this in. I'm sure you've seen this.

10:38.541 --> 10:39.958
Oh, that!

10:40.041 --> 10:41.041
You know, right?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.625
It makes it so smooth. This looks perfect.

10:44.708 --> 10:47.458
When people watch this show,
they'll get the wrong idea.

10:47.541 --> 10:49.416
-Why?
-They'll think you're an expert.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.291
Isn't it smooth? It goes down so smoothly.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.750
-It's much smoother, right?
-Wow.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.541
Were you in a liquor ad? How do you…

11:09.625 --> 11:11.083
To be honest

11:11.583 --> 11:14.125
-I was a late bloomer.
-How late?

11:14.750 --> 11:19.958
I didn't start drinking a lot
until I was in my late 20s.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.125
That scares me a bit.

11:21.208 --> 11:24.541
But I only started drinking often
after I turned 30.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.625
I learned these things.
I work with a lot of young people on set.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.041
-Right.
-So I learned it all from them.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.625
-Shall we drink soju now?
-Yes.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.041
GRILLED CLAMS

13:02.750 --> 13:04.083
We get scallops, too?

13:04.166 --> 13:06.875
-Scallops and…
-The clams are underneath.

13:06.958 --> 13:09.375
-I love scallops.
-These are quahogs.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.541
Yes, these.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.458
Eat these last.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.125
They get watery and put out the fire.

13:15.750 --> 13:18.875
-Save the priciest ones for the last?
-Is that it?

13:18.958 --> 13:22.333
Scallops, pen shells, and quahogs.
These are small pen shells.

13:22.416 --> 13:25.500
These are caught in our sea
and these are imported.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.791
This one's saying,
"I was caught in Korea."

13:28.875 --> 13:30.541
I heard you.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.500
-Wait.
-Here's a pair of tongs.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.791
This looks so good!

13:52.541 --> 13:54.000
Can I just eat it?

13:54.083 --> 13:56.166
-You can dip it in chojang.
-I see.

14:06.291 --> 14:07.458
Everyone's eating this.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.500
It's good.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.416
-Time for some butter.
-Okay.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.708
So you weren't drinking
when grilled clams were in trend.

14:40.791 --> 14:41.666
When was that?

14:41.750 --> 14:46.500
I think they were popular
either in the late 80s or 90s.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.500
I was born in 1982.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.708
-I was too young.
-You see it in movies.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.791
A couple goes on a blind date,

14:56.875 --> 14:59.875
put on gloves, squat down,
and eat grilled clams.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.625
It was a huge trend.

15:01.708 --> 15:06.458
There were so many places in Seoul
that specialized in grilled clams.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.166
Since I started drinking at a late age,

15:10.750 --> 15:14.041
I love drinking
in places with an open view.

15:15.083 --> 15:17.166
-For example…
-Like pojangmacha, the tent bars.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.375
Exactly. I love tent bars.

15:21.166 --> 15:25.041
When I go overseas,
I always drink on sunny patios.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.625
I love that.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.541
Do you go to tent bars?

15:32.625 --> 15:34.041
-The ones outside?
-Yes.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.375
I do, from time to time.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.791
Where at?

15:36.875 --> 15:40.166
Do you know the one
under the overpass in Ichon-dong?

15:40.250 --> 15:41.458
-By the church?
-Yes.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.833
-That's your go-to place.
-There's always a line.

15:44.916 --> 15:47.041
-You like that kind of vibe.
-I do.

15:47.125 --> 15:50.333
Especially for soju.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.875
The vibe is very important.

15:52.958 --> 15:55.916
That's one of the few actual tent bars.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.125
-Right.
-It still has the retro vibe.

15:58.208 --> 16:03.000
You know that I have
a pojangmacha franchise, right?

16:03.666 --> 16:04.666
"Hanshin Pocha."

16:05.250 --> 16:09.583
-I love the dakbal there.
-Really? I developed the recipe.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.125
I love it so much.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.458
I'd buy a ton of it to go
and keep it in the fridge.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.833
-Really?
-Even before I started drinking.

16:16.916 --> 16:20.625
I went for the first time
shortly after I started college.

16:20.708 --> 16:24.416
-I see.
-I watched the 2006 FIFA World Cup there.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.583
At Hanshin Pocha in Gangnam.

16:26.666 --> 16:29.791
That area was so busy
during the World Cup that year.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.125
I really love dakbal.

16:31.208 --> 16:35.083
I was running one of the locations
during the World Cup.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.333
Whenever Korea scored,
they'd ask for the owner.

16:38.416 --> 16:39.250
Why?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.750
They'd clap and tap the table
and ask for the owner.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.333
I might have been one of them.

16:44.041 --> 16:48.208
I couldn't figure out why.
I'm not a sports fan.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.708
I eventually found out
they wanted something on the house.

16:51.791 --> 16:54.250
-I see. Because Team Korea won.
-Right.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.125
"A bottle of soju for each table."

16:56.208 --> 16:58.625
Then they'd roar with applause.
It was hilarious.

16:58.708 --> 17:01.250
-So you gave them out?
-Yes, several times.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.375
Even some food as well.

17:03.458 --> 17:07.208
I'd give out a free dish or soju each time
Korea scored a goal.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.833
-Otherwise, there could've been a riot.
-Right.

17:12.541 --> 17:16.000
Let me tell you
why I started Hanshin Pocha.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
You go to the place
under the Dongho Bridge.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.500
Is it Wonhyo? No.

17:19.583 --> 17:22.583
-It's the Dongjak Bridge, right?
-Right.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.708
All the tent bars were like that.
There are cars driving by.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.875
So you'd sit
with your back facing the road

17:29.958 --> 17:32.666
and the people driving by
can see your back.

17:33.208 --> 17:36.208
-If you think about it, it's dangerous.
-Right.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.541
What if you get hit by a car?
Back then, we drank like that.

17:39.625 --> 17:43.791
When I opened Hanshin Pocha around 1998,

17:43.875 --> 17:47.583
I thought, "Why do we have to drink
in such a dangerous setup?"

17:47.666 --> 17:50.041
-"Why not create a spacious place?"
-Right.

17:50.125 --> 17:54.125
Nothing luxurious, but maybe glass walls
while keeping the tents.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.750
That's how it came about.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.875
-Ingenious!
-And it was a hit.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.708
Do you have a shoot tomorrow?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.833
Tomorrow? No. Do I have something?

18:05.916 --> 18:08.333
-Are you ever free?
-I have my YouTube shoot.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.875
Can you tell the brand of soju
just by tasting it?

18:18.958 --> 18:19.958
I'm not that good.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.541
-I just drink.
-You'd think I can since I'm asking.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.541
I can't either.

18:26.250 --> 18:31.000
I have a soju brand that I prefer,
but I try local soju when I travel.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.750
For example, I'd drink Hallasan in Jeju.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.375
-The white one?
-Yes.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.166
-You like that soju?
-I do.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.416
I rarely get the chance to try
local brands in Seoul.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.666
Nowadays, there are
well-known regional brands

18:44.750 --> 18:47.333
such as Daesun and C1.

18:47.416 --> 18:49.708
The same goes for Chungcheong
and other provinces.

18:49.791 --> 18:50.833
CHUM CHURUM, IJEWOOLINN

18:50.916 --> 18:53.625
There are local soju brands
that represent each region.

18:53.708 --> 18:58.000
Soju used to be made
using the traditional distillation method.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.583
When diluted soju became popular,
companies adapted.

19:00.666 --> 19:03.375
But then the government decided

19:03.458 --> 19:06.916
that there could be only one company
per city or province.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.250
-Just one?
-For each city or province.

19:09.916 --> 19:14.416
Then, to prevent the big soju companies
in Seoul from monopolizing the market,

19:14.500 --> 19:16.041
the government decided that

19:16.125 --> 19:19.541
at least half of the sales in each region
must come from its local brands

19:19.625 --> 19:21.125
to help protect the market.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.458
It was called
the Regional Liquor Protection Act.

19:23.541 --> 19:24.583
Thanks to that

19:24.666 --> 19:27.416
we can enjoy these well-known
regional soju brands now.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.958
CHUM CHURUM

19:30.041 --> 19:34.458
A bottle of Chum Churum, please.
A chilled one.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.541
CHAMISUL

19:38.041 --> 19:41.833
A bottle of Chamisul, please.
Chamisul Fresh.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.041
IJEWOOLINN

19:46.541 --> 19:49.875
A bottle of Linn, please!

19:49.958 --> 19:52.041
This soju is delicious!

19:55.041 --> 19:56.541
IPSAEJU

19:56.625 --> 19:59.958
A bottle of Ipsaeju, please.

20:00.041 --> 20:02.208
Wow, that's smooth. Isn't it?

20:05.416 --> 20:06.958
CHARM

20:07.041 --> 20:09.583
A bottle of Charm, please.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.166
This is amazing!

20:14.000 --> 20:15.625
DAESUN

20:15.708 --> 20:18.291
A bottle of Daesun, please.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.166
Soju tastes fantastic today!

20:23.416 --> 20:24.750
HALLASAN

20:25.250 --> 20:27.416
A bottle of Hallasan, please.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.416
I think I'm getting tipsy!

20:31.541 --> 20:32.541
You know what?

20:32.625 --> 20:37.416
A while ago, the CEOs
from all the soju companies had a meeting.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.458
It went very well.

20:39.541 --> 20:41.208
So they had dinner together.

20:42.416 --> 20:43.958
Guess which soju they drank?

20:44.041 --> 20:47.291
After all the soju company CEOs
had a meeting.

20:47.375 --> 20:52.208
-They drank their own brand?
-It really happened. Was it in 2006?

20:52.291 --> 20:53.958
It was in the newspaper.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.458
-Really?
-Yes.

20:55.541 --> 20:56.875
What they did was,

20:57.458 --> 21:00.250
they poured all the soju
into a big kettle.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.791
For example, a bottle of Jinro,
Chum Churum, Muhak and so on.

21:04.875 --> 21:07.541
They mixed everything
and drank that together.

21:11.375 --> 21:15.125
You're quite a soju connoisseur
to drink local soju when you travel.

21:15.625 --> 21:18.125
I usually like everything.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.958
When I was young,

21:22.041 --> 21:23.041
I didn't know.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.666
Food or booze,
I couldn't tell what was good or bad.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.666
I picked up drinking

21:30.250 --> 21:32.166
because everyone else drank,
except for me.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.708
-I never drank.
-That's not fair.

21:34.791 --> 21:37.125
So I had to drive everyone home
in my minivan.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.916
-My manager and everyone else.
-Because you don't drink.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.083
That's not fair.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.666
So I tried it one day,

21:42.750 --> 21:45.083
but I couldn't walk and felt dizzy.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.208
It was not fun.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.708
-At first, right?
-Right.

21:47.791 --> 21:49.291
So that time…

21:53.458 --> 21:55.166
You're the chugging type!

21:55.250 --> 21:58.000
Please drink any way you want.
Don't mind me.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.500
There are people who drink like you.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.125
The late bloomers, mostly.

22:03.041 --> 22:06.458
When I think back to when I didn't drink,

22:06.958 --> 22:09.958
I don't remember what I did for fun.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.208
So now,

22:13.875 --> 22:18.416
eating and drinking
make up a huge part of my life.

22:19.416 --> 22:20.541
-Right.
-Yes.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.125
Even when I travel.

22:22.708 --> 22:26.166
I travel with my mom often.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.083
We pick a country and go.

22:29.166 --> 22:33.458
So one time, we went to Europe.
And they asked us what we'd like to drink.

22:33.541 --> 22:36.125
So we'd order a large bottle of water.

22:36.666 --> 22:39.416
But because we're drinking,
we wouldn't touch the water.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.458
So I said to my mom,
"I don't think we need to order water."

22:43.541 --> 22:45.916
So we started to order
our drinks right away.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.666
And it was fine.

22:47.750 --> 22:51.333
-Also, water costs more than beer.
-That's right.

22:51.416 --> 22:53.666
So we'd order beer with our breakfast.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.500
Good thing you two get along.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.083
Yes, my mom likes to drink.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.750
-It runs in the blood.
-Yes.

22:58.833 --> 23:02.000
Drinking gives me so much joy.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.083
The next day is not so fun.

23:04.166 --> 23:06.833
It's totally okay.

23:06.916 --> 23:09.666
-What happened?
-It happens when grilling clams.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.875
-Water, please.
-You aren't drunk, are you?

23:13.666 --> 23:15.333
-It's okay.
-I'm not drunk.

23:18.333 --> 23:21.041
Like I was saying, I rarely watch movies.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.583
But I watched that one.

23:23.250 --> 23:26.583
What was the title?
The one about poisonous herbs.

23:27.875 --> 23:31.500
-Poisonous plant. That movie…
-I was in it? It's Detective K.

23:33.250 --> 23:36.375
Yes, that one. I loved it.
You play an evil character in it.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.750
-That was ten years ago.
-Not evil but--

23:39.333 --> 23:41.250
-It was a strong character.
-Yes.

23:41.333 --> 23:44.000
I also watched that one.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.041
You see, I majored in social welfare.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.500
It may sound funny, but I'm pretty honest.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.291
I've made donations,

23:51.375 --> 23:55.666
and the TV shows I do
aim to contribute to society.

23:55.750 --> 23:59.250
Whenever I'm asked why I do what I do,

23:59.750 --> 24:00.833
I honestly say

24:00.916 --> 24:04.083
I got into this by mistake
while pretending to be a good person.

24:04.708 --> 24:07.500
-I can relate.
-Right? I'm sure you do.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.250
In my case…

24:12.041 --> 24:15.708
It used to bother me a lot
but not so much anymore.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.291
-I had a shoot once.
-Okay.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.916
And the people had heard
I was super easygoing.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.583
But that day… I can be timid too.

24:24.666 --> 24:28.125
-So I was quiet all day.
-Right.

24:28.916 --> 24:33.291
But later on, I heard people were saying,
"She's not as easygoing as we thought."

24:33.375 --> 24:34.500
Goodness.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.708
-So…
-I know what that's like.

24:36.791 --> 24:41.333
Right? I'm so grateful
that people think I'm a good person.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.958
But I'm not necessarily
such a wonderful person.

24:45.041 --> 24:48.041
So it can be stressful
that people think so highly of me.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.041
Totally.

24:49.125 --> 24:53.625
I'll tell you how I've overcome…
No, how I dealt with it.

24:54.208 --> 24:58.625
At first, I took advantage of it.
"Oh, I have such a likable public image?"

24:58.708 --> 25:02.291
Honestly, I thought,
"I have such a likable image?"

25:02.375 --> 25:04.541
To be honest, I used to have a foul mouth.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.958
-Let's hear it.
-Gosh, no.

25:07.041 --> 25:11.625
But people thought so highly of me,
so I started to watch my mouth,

25:11.708 --> 25:13.916
which further improved my public image.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.208
So I thought,
"I could take advantage of it."

25:16.291 --> 25:19.541
I was hoping to use it
to benefit my business.

25:19.625 --> 25:22.916
So I donated to good causes,
and everything I did made the news.

25:23.416 --> 25:26.041
And that improved my reputation even more.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.916
The good thing about it is that

25:29.000 --> 25:31.333
it's not a bad thing to take advantage of.

25:31.416 --> 25:33.791
Because the more
you live up to your reputation,

25:33.875 --> 25:37.416
the closer you get to become
that person you aspired to be.

25:39.541 --> 25:41.041
Right, it's not a bad thing.

25:41.125 --> 25:47.000
Even if you did it with a plan
to use it for your own benefit,

25:47.083 --> 25:50.750
as long as you keep your promise.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.333
-You act on it.
-Right.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.458
-It's not a lie.
-That's what matters.

25:57.333 --> 26:00.458
It's the social welfare major in us.

26:11.291 --> 26:12.541
We'll get another soju.

26:12.625 --> 26:13.875
How about C1?

26:13.958 --> 26:15.416
Yes, shall we?

26:15.500 --> 26:18.416
-It's C1, with the letter C.
-It's you over there!

26:19.416 --> 26:20.333
It's still there?

26:21.458 --> 26:23.916
-Right.
-We must drink Joeunday today.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.291
For our third bottle.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.291
-Thank you.
-Yes, the third.

26:28.958 --> 26:29.791
You know…

26:31.708 --> 26:37.291
Seeing people who are
so warmhearted and giving

26:37.375 --> 26:38.958
makes me reflect on myself.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.208
-Really?
-And it's comforting to me.

26:41.291 --> 26:44.666
Actors don't get such opportunities often.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.833
But the programs that you do…

26:47.916 --> 26:49.708
I mean, TV series and films.

26:49.791 --> 26:52.541
The roles you play make a social impact.

26:52.625 --> 26:55.083
Yes, when the projects do well.

26:55.166 --> 26:57.750
I was deeply impressed

26:58.250 --> 27:01.000
when you played that blind character.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.541
-Right.
-Yes.

27:02.625 --> 27:05.541
That one or the one about child abuse.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.458
That one, yes.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.750
Wasn't that why you chose those roles?

27:09.250 --> 27:10.416
The visually impaired--

27:10.500 --> 27:12.875
-It must've affected your decision.
-Miss Baek?

27:12.958 --> 27:15.625
-Your surname was Baek in it.
-It was about child abuse.

27:15.708 --> 27:17.791
-You're right.
-That's why I remember it.

27:17.875 --> 27:18.708
Baek Sang-a.

27:18.791 --> 27:20.791
Baek, Paik. We shared the same surname.

27:20.875 --> 27:25.083
It's one of the social issues
that I'm passionate about.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.000
Didn't you win a lot of awards?

27:27.708 --> 27:29.208
I wasn't expecting it.

27:30.125 --> 27:31.791
To be honest,

27:31.875 --> 27:35.791
one of the things I cannot tolerate
is mistreatment of children.

27:35.875 --> 27:37.125
Right.

27:37.208 --> 27:40.750
I'm not married and I don't have kids yet,

27:41.333 --> 27:43.875
but I love my nephews so much.
I love kids.

27:43.958 --> 27:47.541
I majored in social welfare
because I wanted a child studies degree.

27:47.625 --> 27:48.958
I see.

27:49.041 --> 27:51.625
It's true I chose the role

27:51.708 --> 27:55.666
because I felt a movie would be a good way
to raise awareness on the issue.

27:56.833 --> 28:01.375
But before filming even began,
my casting became controversial.

28:01.458 --> 28:02.458
Why?

28:02.541 --> 28:06.250
Everyone thought it didn't suit me.
I'd never played a character like that.

28:06.333 --> 28:09.083
So the investors backed out
when I got cast.

28:10.208 --> 28:13.041
When the filming was finished,
no distributors wanted it.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.958
As the lead actor, I felt horrible.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.875
-There were times when I…
-Take your time.

28:22.208 --> 28:26.583
Having this "nice girl" image
became an obstacle as an actor.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.333
-Come on.
-Let me explain.

28:30.416 --> 28:34.208
It was like a mold I had to fit into.
A prejudice of a sort.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.208
"These roles won't suit her."

28:36.291 --> 28:38.083
And Miss Baek was one of them.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.041
Can I eat this?

28:42.125 --> 28:43.875
-No, put it here.
-Okay.

28:44.916 --> 28:49.125
-You can eat this. I have scallops here.
-Don't worry, we'll order more food.

28:49.791 --> 28:51.750
We'll get the ureokgui too.

28:51.833 --> 28:53.958
-Bukeoguk?
-No, ureokgui, grilled rockfish.

28:54.041 --> 28:56.333
-Grilled rockfish? Nice.
-Grilled rockfish.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.458
I saw it over there and it looked good.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.375
GRILLED ROCKFISH

30:01.541 --> 30:03.916
-Is this the rockfish?
-Yes.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.375
Try it.

30:26.333 --> 30:29.166
-We have to have ramyeon later.
-Of course.

30:29.250 --> 30:33.208
I was in Busan two and a half years ago
for the Busan International Film Festival.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.958
That's when Miss Baek came out.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.625
Don't celebrities drink a lot
during film festivals?

30:37.708 --> 30:40.000
-But there was a storm.
-Oh no.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.791
-We couldn't go to the tent bars.
-When was it?

30:42.875 --> 30:45.541
It was October of 2018.

30:46.125 --> 30:49.375
I know this
because my wife comes to film festivals.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.708
She's already drunk
when I call her at 10 p.m.

30:52.791 --> 30:55.791
How did you two meet?

30:55.875 --> 30:57.833
-Through a mutual friend.
-Right.

30:57.916 --> 31:02.208
That's why I'm not a big fan
of the film festival here.

31:04.666 --> 31:08.666
-Because she drinks a lot?
-She's already drunk by early evening.

31:09.541 --> 31:10.916
I go, "What are you doing?"

31:11.833 --> 31:14.666
-And she goes, "You don't know."
-Right.

31:14.750 --> 31:16.125
"Everyone drinks here."

31:20.541 --> 31:22.208
You don't get mad, right?

31:22.291 --> 31:25.291
Never. And she asks me
to come to Busan right away.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.833
-I'm like, "How?"
-She asks you to come?

31:27.916 --> 31:31.333
My gosh, that's so lovely!
You should've listened to her.

31:31.416 --> 31:33.875
-I got work to do.
-Why didn't you join her?

31:33.958 --> 31:37.166
That's why I don't like
the film festival here.

31:38.041 --> 31:41.208
She gets drunk every time she's here.
But later on, she told me…

31:41.291 --> 31:43.250
She and I drink often at home.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.583
-You still do?
-Sure.

31:44.666 --> 31:48.458
I only drink with the same people.
I either drink at home with my wife

31:48.541 --> 31:53.833
or with my friend and business partner
who's been with my company the longest.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.375
I drink with him.

31:56.125 --> 31:57.708
Who do you drink with?

31:58.250 --> 32:00.541
I usually drink with my family.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.083
But recently

32:02.166 --> 32:03.416
I started

32:04.541 --> 32:07.916
hanging out with the actors
that I work with.

32:09.041 --> 32:13.500
I really love soju
because it's so cost-efficient.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.166
It's the best.

32:15.250 --> 32:18.541
I'm not a big fan of spending
a lot of money on booze.

32:19.458 --> 32:23.291
-The same goes for wine.
-I see.

32:24.625 --> 32:27.125
-Nothing's more cost-efficient than this.
-Right.

32:30.708 --> 32:35.916
With certain foods,
soju is the only way to go.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.833
Like gopchang.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.708
-You like gopchang?
-And hagfish.

32:38.791 --> 32:41.958
Wine doesn't go well with that.
Neither does makgeolli.

32:42.041 --> 32:43.416
You like gopchang , I see.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.375
I love it.

32:44.458 --> 32:46.333
By the way, I wanted to ask you

32:47.041 --> 32:48.791
if there are any restaurants

32:48.875 --> 32:52.500
that you always go to
whenever you're in Busan.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.708
-I recommend "Baekhwa Yanggopchang."
-Baekhwa Yanggopchang? Where's that?

32:58.208 --> 33:01.041
Next to Jagalchi Market.
It looks like a bar.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.500
-Baekhwa Yanggopchang.
-Can we get a new grill?

33:04.083 --> 33:07.000
When you get there,
the tables are all numbered.

33:07.083 --> 33:09.208
The setup looks like a bar.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.458
Which hangover soup
will you have tomorrow?

33:11.541 --> 33:14.458
Probably either bokguk or daegutang.

33:14.541 --> 33:17.708
Bokguk, daegutang, or dwaeji gukbap?

33:19.625 --> 33:22.708
That is hard.
Bokguk, daegutang, or dwaeji gukbap…

33:24.791 --> 33:27.750
-Dwaeji gukbap since I like meat.
-Me too! Where?

33:27.833 --> 33:30.291
-Ssangdungi?
-Ssangdungi? In Haeundae?

33:30.375 --> 33:32.875
Ssangdungi. Hold on.

33:34.541 --> 33:38.083
My original favorite was Masan Restaurant.
But it became too famous.

33:38.166 --> 33:42.208
I don't mind the crowd
as long as the food is good.

33:42.291 --> 33:45.458
Then, Masan Restaurant.
Let me lift it for you.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.666
What does Masan Restaurant offer?

33:47.750 --> 33:50.416
It's one of the original
dwaeji gukbap places.

33:52.166 --> 33:54.416
What will you have for dinner
after hangover soup?

33:55.416 --> 33:59.375
After my hangover soup,
the dinner will be…

33:59.958 --> 34:01.833
-Busan-style mulhoe.
-I love that.

34:01.916 --> 34:04.416
You mix it and eat with rice.
Go to Donghae Mulhoe.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.500
Got it.

34:05.583 --> 34:08.625
-If you still have time after that…
-I have lots of time.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.791
Go to Choryang-dong,
across the street from the Busan Station.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.250
-Where?
-Choryang-dong.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.250
The entire area is Chinatown.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.875
-The dumplings?
-That, too.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.416
-And nanjianwanzi.
-I love them!

34:19.500 --> 34:20.666
-You do?
-Totally!

34:20.750 --> 34:22.666
The place is called Geumryong!

34:24.333 --> 34:27.333
Geumryong. I got it.
I love dumplings so much.

34:27.416 --> 34:28.708
You like dumplings?

34:28.791 --> 34:32.208
I do. It's my favorite part
when I'm eating tteokmanduguk.

34:33.500 --> 34:37.458
The Internet is the only place
I can get such information.

34:37.958 --> 34:40.666
-So I only know the famous places.
-I know a lot.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.500
-Pardon?
-I know many good places.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.583
Have you wondered
why all soju bottles are green?

34:52.083 --> 34:53.791
-They're all green.
-Right.

34:57.375 --> 34:59.333
CHARM

35:09.750 --> 35:13.000
I'm going to sound really old
if I tell you this story

35:13.083 --> 35:14.875
but I'm gonna tell you anyway.

35:14.958 --> 35:17.791
A long time ago,
soju bottles had different colors

35:17.875 --> 35:19.958
like pale blue and black.

35:20.041 --> 35:23.291
Imongryong and Jebiwon used to be
pale blue colors.

35:23.375 --> 35:24.666
KIM SATGAT, SUPER GOLD, BOBAE

35:24.750 --> 35:25.791
GEUMBOK

35:25.875 --> 35:27.916
You probably have no idea.
This was ages ago.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.625
Starting with the brand, Green,
soju companies began to use green bottles.

35:34.416 --> 35:36.958
CHUM CHURUM, GREEN, JOEUNDAY, CHAMISUL

35:41.375 --> 35:42.833
Here's an interesting story.

35:42.916 --> 35:46.750
They started the green bottle trend
among all the soju companies.

35:46.833 --> 35:51.041
And the government stepped in and said,
"We shouldn't waste the bottles."

35:51.125 --> 35:53.791
-Because people would just break them.
-Right.

35:53.875 --> 35:58.083
So the government suggested
they all use the same type of bottle.

35:58.625 --> 36:02.250
Since there were a few soju companies,
they could just share the bottles.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.916
See? They look the same
without the labels.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.958
When I was young, after you drank soju,

36:07.041 --> 36:11.083
the bar owners would return the bottles
into corresponding boxes.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.500
-Really?
-They'd collect the empties like that.

36:13.583 --> 36:14.875
Daesun in the Daesun box.

36:14.958 --> 36:16.583
C1 bottles in the C1 box.

36:16.666 --> 36:20.166
The same goes for Jinro bottles
and all other brands.

36:20.708 --> 36:23.625
But when I was running my tent bar,

36:24.625 --> 36:28.458
alcohol distribution companies would come
and just collect all the bottles.

36:29.791 --> 36:32.583
They'd collect the bottles
in any box they could grab.

36:32.666 --> 36:35.750
So I asked them,
"Isn't it hard to sort the bottles later?"

36:35.833 --> 36:39.125
They said things have changed
and now they all share the bottles.

36:39.208 --> 36:41.041
Really?

36:41.125 --> 36:44.416
And there's another funny story.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.791
For example, there's a Jinro bottle,

36:46.875 --> 36:49.833
but the embossed logo on the bottle
is different.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.791
-Right.
-So people thought it was a fake.

36:51.875 --> 36:54.041
For example, it'd have a Jinro label

36:54.125 --> 36:57.666
but with a different brand's logo
embossed on the bottle.

36:57.750 --> 37:01.666
And because of that,
people used to say they were knockoffs.

37:02.416 --> 37:03.875
It's a fun memory.

37:03.958 --> 37:06.750
JOEUNDAY, DAESUN, C1

37:13.291 --> 37:16.375
DAESUN

37:29.666 --> 37:31.791
EMPTY BOTTLES COLLECTED

37:31.875 --> 37:34.375
DAESUN, JOEUNDAY, CHAMISUL, WHITE

37:38.250 --> 37:40.458
WASHED

37:44.541 --> 37:45.458
DAESUN

37:49.583 --> 37:50.875
CHECKED FOR IMPURITIES

37:52.583 --> 37:54.875
FILLED

38:02.958 --> 38:05.166
LABELED

38:06.041 --> 38:08.875
DAESUN

38:19.833 --> 38:21.791
They're eating Chapagetti over there.

38:21.875 --> 38:22.708
In that pot.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.875
-It's time for our ramyeon.
-Totally. But I think that's Chapagetti.

38:26.958 --> 38:30.000
-They even cook Chapagetti for you here?
-No, wait!

38:31.875 --> 38:33.250
Time to order Joeunday now.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.333
-That's right.
-Excuse me!

38:37.625 --> 38:41.166
-We don't have to drink it, but…
-A bottle of Joeunday, please.

38:41.250 --> 38:44.083
-Since we're here, let's try all three.
-That's right.

38:48.375 --> 38:51.250
-We have to have ramyeon.
-Yes, it's a must.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.958
-We must eat it.
-I actually like noodles better than rice.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.916
Don't actresses avoid it
since it makes their faces puffy?

38:58.000 --> 38:59.125
Not me.

38:59.208 --> 39:05.208
I even love checking out
all the newly released ramyeon products.

39:05.291 --> 39:08.166
-You must really love ramyeon.
-I can live on ramyeon.

39:08.250 --> 39:09.875
It's my comfort food.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.791
-Noodles in general.
-That's so funny.

39:12.875 --> 39:15.541
I think Korean ramyeons are amazing.

39:15.625 --> 39:16.875
I'm proud of them.

39:18.375 --> 39:21.541
-Korea makes the best instant noodles.
-Totally.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.208
I travel all over the world.

39:24.291 --> 39:27.416
I always buy ramyeon from other countries
to try them.

39:28.083 --> 39:31.208
And Korean ramyeon is the best
and not because I'm Korean.

39:31.291 --> 39:32.250
I agree.

39:32.333 --> 39:34.541
They do a good job. What's your favorite?

39:34.625 --> 39:36.583
What kind of ramyeon do you like?

39:37.666 --> 39:39.166
With soup or no soup?

39:40.458 --> 39:44.375
That's apples and oranges.
Jjajangmyeon doesn't need soup.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.583
What's your favorite? A soupy one?

39:48.875 --> 39:50.916
No, my absolute favorite is…

39:52.583 --> 39:55.916
CHAPAGETTI, JIN RAMEN, SNACK RAMEN,
SHIN RAMYUN

39:56.000 --> 39:59.625
BIBIM MEN, ANSUNGTANGMYUN
HOT CHICKEN FLAVOR RAMEN, SARIGOMTANG

40:07.166 --> 40:08.125
I like Snack Ramen.

40:08.666 --> 40:11.500
-Me too. It's good with rice.
-It cooks fast. Yes.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.750
My favorite is Chapagetti.

40:13.833 --> 40:15.666
I see.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.541
For the soupy ones,

40:17.625 --> 40:21.791
-I like Jin Ramen, the spicy kind.
-I like the mild ones too.

40:21.875 --> 40:24.458
JIN RAMEN SPICY, CHAPAGETTI

40:24.541 --> 40:26.416
JIN RAMEN SPICY

40:34.750 --> 40:40.000
RAMYEON POWERHOUSE

40:52.125 --> 40:53.750
RAMYEON

41:31.458 --> 41:34.083
-What's your cure for hangovers?
-Hangover?

41:34.166 --> 41:35.166
Recently…

41:36.875 --> 41:39.041
-I've been eating porridge.
-Porridge?

41:39.125 --> 41:41.291
Or I'd get a burger.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.541
In my day,
we ate jjajangmyeon to look cool.

41:44.625 --> 41:46.750
-You know what?
-What?

41:46.833 --> 41:51.041
There's a world famous beverage
that's known to cure hangovers.

41:51.791 --> 41:52.750
It's called IdH.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.875
-I, D…
-IdH.

41:55.958 --> 41:59.583
When you write IdH,
what does it look like?

42:01.875 --> 42:03.500
-I, D, H?
-It's funny.

42:03.583 --> 42:09.166
-Try writing IdH like this.
-I see, IdH.

42:10.250 --> 42:11.583
What's that in Korean?

42:13.083 --> 42:15.208
IdH.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.625
-Dae?
-Bae.

42:19.291 --> 42:20.208
"Bae"?

42:20.291 --> 42:23.000
IdH. It looks like "Bae" in Korean.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.958
-Bae, as in "pear."
-That's correct.

42:28.375 --> 42:31.875
You know the crushed pear juice?

42:31.958 --> 42:35.166
That's my go-to hangover drink.

42:35.250 --> 42:36.083
Many of us do.

42:36.666 --> 42:39.458
But it's become famous
even outside of Korea

42:39.541 --> 42:42.291
as a magical hangover cure.

42:42.375 --> 42:45.291
Foreign pears taste
nothing like Korean pears.

42:45.375 --> 42:48.291
Australia is
the biggest importer of Korean pears.

42:48.375 --> 42:51.916
And they tested to see
whether it can really cure hangovers.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.916
It's actually high in asparagine.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.291
A foreign magazine tested it to see
whether it helps treat hangovers.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.750
It turns out, it's really effective.

43:01.833 --> 43:04.833
JOEUNDAY, CHAMISUL, CHARM, DAESUN
LINN, CHUM CHURUM, HALLASAN

43:18.916 --> 43:19.916
BEAT YOUR HANGOVER

43:26.750 --> 43:33.750
CRUSHED PEAR
MADE WITH KOREAN PEARS

43:38.291 --> 43:40.041
-You really like to drink.
-Pardon?

43:40.125 --> 43:41.083
You like to drink.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.583
-It's great.
-But the thing is

43:44.791 --> 43:46.291
I eat a lot when I drink.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.250
-Drinking is all about the food.
-Right?

43:49.333 --> 43:52.375
Yes, of course.
I never want to drink when I'm full.

43:53.083 --> 43:55.416
I only drink when I'm hungry.
Never when I'm full.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.250
I just really love this vibe.

43:58.875 --> 44:02.083
When I drink, I care a great deal

44:02.166 --> 44:04.208
about the lighting and music.

44:05.708 --> 44:09.666
-That's what all late bloomers say.
-Are you calling me an amateur?

44:10.541 --> 44:14.250
I have control over them
when I drink at home, but not here.

44:14.333 --> 44:16.958
I never drink when I'm sad.

44:17.041 --> 44:18.083
That's good.

44:18.166 --> 44:19.666
You see, drinking…

44:20.416 --> 44:22.541
It makes me happier on good days.

44:22.625 --> 44:24.708
And it's like a friend on bad days.

44:25.333 --> 44:28.541
But when I'm drinking alone,
I only drink beer or wine.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.375
Soju is…

44:32.708 --> 44:35.708
-I feel pitiful if I drink soju alone.
-It looks lame.

44:35.791 --> 44:36.916
Yes, exactly!

44:37.416 --> 44:39.083
But surprisingly,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.375
when I have someone to drink soju with,

44:44.416 --> 44:46.125
I just love that interaction.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.166
When I think about the things in life

44:50.250 --> 44:53.916
that make me happy,

44:54.000 --> 44:59.583
I feel the happiest
when I see my loved ones happy.

45:00.083 --> 45:03.791
I'm happiest when I'm having good food

45:04.625 --> 45:08.833
over nice drinks with the people I love
and sharing experiences with them.

45:08.916 --> 45:10.416
That's the right way to drink.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.833
-You think so?
-Yes.

45:11.916 --> 45:13.041
That's great.

45:41.916 --> 45:46.250
I don't crave for wine or beer
when I drink with people.

45:46.333 --> 45:50.708
But when you drink soju with people,
it helps you bond at a deeper level.

45:55.750 --> 45:59.166
DAESUN

46:12.750 --> 46:16.083
JOEUNDAY

46:17.208 --> 46:19.541
But I can't drink soju by myself.

46:20.583 --> 46:24.791
Soju has this power to…

46:25.375 --> 46:26.666
It bonds people.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.291
It brings people together.

46:28.375 --> 46:32.333
It breaks the ice and helps you
befriend even those you barely know.

46:32.416 --> 46:33.333
Totally.

46:33.416 --> 46:36.750
But I can't drink it by myself.

46:38.791 --> 46:39.708
It makes sense.

46:40.916 --> 46:43.333
CHO-RONG, I PRAY YOU'LL BE BORN HEALTHY!
FROM MOM

46:43.416 --> 46:45.375
SANG-JIN & JI-WON
LET'S BE HAPPY TOGETHER

47:33.000 --> 47:35.041
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Sure.

47:36.166 --> 47:37.458
Where's the restroom?

47:37.541 --> 47:40.083
-Over there, on the left.
-Okay.

48:06.125 --> 48:06.958
Mom.

48:07.916 --> 48:09.666
-Hey.
-You're at my place.

48:10.666 --> 48:12.666
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?

48:13.208 --> 48:15.000
How many bottles have you had?

48:15.500 --> 48:17.208
We only had three bottles.

48:17.291 --> 48:18.500
Look, here.

48:20.833 --> 48:23.083
-What did you have for dinner?
-Yeah.

48:24.250 --> 48:26.375
-What?
-What did you have for dinner?

48:27.541 --> 48:31.583
Your uncle took us out for hoe.

48:31.666 --> 48:33.666
I see. Are you sleeping there tonight?

48:34.666 --> 48:35.500
Yeah.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.750
Okay.

48:40.166 --> 48:41.333
Come meet my mom.

48:41.416 --> 48:43.875
-Mom.
-Yes?

48:44.708 --> 48:45.666
Meet seonbaenim.

48:45.750 --> 48:47.458
-Hello.
-Hello.

48:48.166 --> 48:50.708
-Nice to meet you.
-This is my mom.

48:50.791 --> 48:53.000
Let's grab a drink together next time.

48:53.083 --> 48:55.958
-Mom, he lives in our neighborhood.
-My gosh!

48:56.458 --> 48:57.958
I'll invite you to my place.

48:58.041 --> 49:00.250
-She'll be…
-Come over sometime.

49:00.333 --> 49:01.791
I'll make makgeolli.

49:02.833 --> 49:05.083
-Thank you for inviting me.
-She drinks a lot.

49:05.166 --> 49:06.250
That's okay.

49:06.875 --> 49:08.500
All right, Mom. Good night.

49:09.125 --> 49:10.416
Bye.

49:17.250 --> 49:19.083
You have to invite us over.

49:20.083 --> 49:22.208
-Sure thing.
-We'll be there.

49:22.291 --> 49:23.541
Yes, of course!

49:24.291 --> 49:26.666
-I'll pour you one.
-Let me pour you one.

49:48.541 --> 49:50.666
I love a fun night
of drinking with friends

49:50.750 --> 49:53.750
where everyone's having a great time.

49:54.458 --> 49:57.333
But if I drink when I'm stressed or sad,

49:57.416 --> 50:00.291
it makes me feel even sadder.

50:00.916 --> 50:03.208
I once drank when I got my heart broken.

50:03.791 --> 50:05.833
Someone broke your heart? Crazy bastard!

50:05.916 --> 50:07.583
Come on.

50:08.333 --> 50:09.583
No one would believe you.

50:11.541 --> 50:12.791
My goodness.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.041
-But I was…
-Some guys are just too spoiled.

50:18.166 --> 50:20.333
It happens, you know.

50:21.541 --> 50:24.416
But I think listing excuses
as to why you want to break up

50:24.500 --> 50:26.333
is such a cowardly thing to do.

50:27.166 --> 50:31.000
You can end things because
you don't love the person as much anymore.

50:31.083 --> 50:32.625
I don't know.

50:32.708 --> 50:34.541
Looking back now, I think

50:34.625 --> 50:37.208
it's good to experience
many things in life, good or bad.
