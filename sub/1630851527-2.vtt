WEBVTT

00:54.120 --> 00:56.000
Come here, girl. Jess, Jess.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.280
DOG BARKS

01:16.200 --> 01:18.040
DOOR CHIMES

01:19.400 --> 01:21.600
This way, Mrs Brompton.
Thank you.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.520
To what do we owe the pleasure?

01:24.520 --> 01:26.240
Well, it's that time of year.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.720
Oh, the Daffodil Ball, I've been
counting the days.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.360
And who's the lucky lass tonight?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.560
Who can say at this point,
Mrs Brompton.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.440
Ah, Jim, Jim, perfect timing.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.840
Ah, wallet!

01:35.840 --> 01:37.720
I'm sorry, what am I paying for now?

01:37.720 --> 01:39.520
It's the Daffodil Ball tonight.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.000
All proceeds go towards the
restoration of the steeple.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.920
It's the highlight of the social
calendar.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.000
There'll be music, dancing, the
frisson of a warm spring evening.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.360
Mr Farnon not in?

01:49.360 --> 01:51.920
He's yet to grace us
with his presence.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.600
How about it, Mrs Hall, a ticket
for you?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.920
Just four, please. Four?

01:58.920 --> 02:01.120
Yeah, need one for my date
for the evening.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.160
Your date?

02:03.160 --> 02:04.480
The day is young.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.720
Come on, Jim, no girl likes a
cheapskate.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.120
Who's the extra one for?
Who do you think?

02:10.120 --> 02:13.480
Time waits for no man, Jim lad, and
neither will Helen.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.640
Morning, Mrs Brompton.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.320
Diana - please.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.120
How can we be of service?

02:19.120 --> 02:20.720
Daffodil Ball.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.280
If you're not too busy I wondered

02:25.280 --> 02:27.200
if we might lure you on to the dance
floor.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.520
Well, that depends what you're using
as bait.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.040
SHE GIGGLES

02:31.040 --> 02:32.560
Stop it.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.960
It would be our pleasure to
support the cause.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.280
Tristan, money? Yeah.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.120
"Our pleasure" really?

02:40.120 --> 02:45.120
And, uh, Mrs Hall, would you mind
showing Diana out?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.640
Show her out?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.320
We'll have to scrape her off him
first.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.600
This way.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.080
Swap. Thank you. Thank you,
bye-bye...

02:58.840 --> 03:00.680
What?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.000
What, is it?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.240
I mean, if you can't see, then

03:03.240 --> 03:04.880
there's really no hope for you,
brother.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.560
If that woman were any more forward,
she'd be here yesterday.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.480
Nonsense, Diana's happily married.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.600
Isn't she?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.520
Not any longer. Not for a year now.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.360
Well, she was probably just
being friendly.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.040
You know, I heard he ran off with
the housekeeper.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.640
I heard the gardener.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.600
How did you get on with Merrick last
night?

03:22.600 --> 03:24.960
I thought you were going to tag
that on to the end of your list.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.600
Oh, James, you really can't allow
yourself to be so forgetful.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.880
The memory is a muscle that must be
exercised.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.040
I'll get up there right away.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.240
No, no, you've got a busy surgery
today.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.400
Here.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.080
Organised as ever.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.760
Why doesn't Tristan stay
and help out?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.560
With both examination rooms
in operation,

03:40.560 --> 03:42.000
we'd get through them a lot quicker.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.440
I'd like to keep Tristan under my
wing for a while.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.880
He's still got a lot to learn.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.840
Go on, go and get ready.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Mr Farnon - postcard from Dorothy.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.400
Who's the old Siegfried?

03:58.400 --> 04:01.800
And why does she hope he gets out
from time to time?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.520
Sorry, I thought it were for me.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.160
I didn't realise until it were too
late.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.400
I'm sure.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.080
HORN BLARES

04:45.040 --> 04:47.400
All right, all right, I'm coming.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.520
No Rover? Not today, it's leaking
oil everywhere.

04:53.520 --> 04:57.320
Do your tie up, man, we must present
our very best self to our clients.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.800
You know, you could do far worse
than Diana Brompton.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
I see you got another postcard from
Dorothy.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.120
How's Malta?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.400
Hot and rocky.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.440
She's looking forward to becoming a
grandmother.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.520
Shame, I got the impression you were
rather fond of her.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.800
Oh, hang on, hang on, slow down,
slow down.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.680
Stop.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.000
Morning, Helen.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.520
All right, Triss, Siegfried.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.840
What can I do for you?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.280
Oh, it's not me, actually.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.200
Um, I think James wanted to see
you about something.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.720
He's at the house if you wanted to
pop in.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.760
Right.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.840
Thanks.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.680
Bye. BOTH: Bye.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.560
Helen. Hello.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.400
Please, come in, come in.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.160
Come on through.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.520
There we are.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.040
OK, then...

06:05.040 --> 06:06.760
..how can I help?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.400
I thought you wanted to see me.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.960
You did? I mean, I do. Why wouldn't
I?

06:10.960 --> 06:12.280
Of course I'd like to see you...

06:12.280 --> 06:13.400
Right.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.320
Only, I've got to get back and put
our carrots in, so, shall we?

06:17.320 --> 06:18.680
Sorry, shall we what?

06:18.680 --> 06:20.400
The reason you wanted to see me.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.680
I'm not sure I understand -
you came here.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.560
Because Tristan asked me to.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.320
Ah.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.360
He said you wanted to speak to me
about something.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.520
I'm sure he did.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.400
Well...

06:31.400 --> 06:34.000
Triss and I are going to the
Daffodil Ball.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.520
And I couldn't be happier for you.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.960
Oh, no, no, he's not...
Not together.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.760
I mean, well, we are but not...

06:39.760 --> 06:41.080
James, it's fine...

06:41.080 --> 06:43.640
..you have my blessings.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.360
See, because of that...

06:45.360 --> 06:47.520
..now I'm not inviting you.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.320
I had a spare ticket but I'll just
have to give it to someone else.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.080
Probably for the best.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.440
I haven't really been out since...

06:54.440 --> 06:55.840
..well...

06:57.960 --> 06:59.440
No-one will care.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.600
We'll go as a group, you, me,
Triss...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
..whoever he manages to drag along.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.280
I'm a terrible dancer,

07:08.280 --> 07:12.000
so that amusement alone is a good
enough reason to come.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.760
I don't know.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.440
DOOR CHIMES

07:18.000 --> 07:19.240
It's my dog.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.440
He disappeared yesterday
evening on one of our walks.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.920
I found him when I went back out
again this morning,

07:23.920 --> 07:26.360
he must've been in this
trap all night.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.040
Well, bring him through.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.160
James!

07:29.160 --> 07:30.600
DOG WHINES

07:30.600 --> 07:32.120
I need you!

07:32.120 --> 07:33.800
Don't worry, go.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.360
We need to get him something for the
pain and sedated right away.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.560
What's his name? It's Rock.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.320
Mrs Hall, pass the cotton wool,
please.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.680
You'll be able to save him,
won't you?

07:58.680 --> 07:59.960
I can't tell.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.800
I won't be able to tell you
until I've explored the wound.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.680
Who would do such a thing?

08:07.800 --> 08:10.360
It's monstrous.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.880
Oh, it looks a mess.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.640
I won't know until I'm right
inside how bad it is.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.840
What I'd do for an X-ray machine
now.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.480
Doesn't seem natural, being able to

08:18.480 --> 08:20.880
see your insides on the outside like
that.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.080
They're an incredible diagnostic
tool.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.160
All right, he's asleep.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.320
I don't think the leg's broken.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.400
We better hope there's still some
circulation to the paw.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.720
And if there's not?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.440
I'm afraid he'll lose the foot.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.440
Colonel, good morning.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.240
Now, then, Farnon, what's all this
about?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.840
We were expecting you last night.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.360
Yeah, I'm afraid, there was
something

09:03.360 --> 09:05.080
of an administrative balls up.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.960
My colleague missed you off his
list.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.280
Oh, and there I was believing I was
one of your most valued clients.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.920
Oh, I'm almost hurt.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.320
Rest assured, you have my undivided
attention now.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.440
Bag please, Tristan.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.440
Yes, err, unfortunately, I've

09:17.440 --> 09:19.720
had to find another dance partner.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.320
Sorry to say, too little, too late,
old chap.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.680
Still, there's, there's nothing like
a bit of healthy

09:26.680 --> 09:29.960
competition to keep you on your
toes, hey, Farnon?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.440
Indeed.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.000
George, what a qualified pleasure it
is to see you.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.040
HE LAUGHS

09:36.040 --> 09:38.080
Now, now, chaps, we mustn't
squabble.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.200
I'd hate to be the bone between a
pair of scrapping dogs.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.120
If you're finding yourself
unable to cope,

09:43.120 --> 09:46.160
I could always take a few more
clients off your hands.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.040
I'm perfectly capa... More than
capable, thank you.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.720
Oh, there's no shame in admitting
you can't keep up.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.920
The years are rolling on.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.640
Ha-ha, the coup de grace.

09:55.640 --> 09:57.560
Until next time, Hubert.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.840
Rolling on? You're rolling on.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.080
He's older than I am.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.760
Still, since you've come all this
way,

10:03.760 --> 10:07.000
there's no harm in you casting
an expert eye over her.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.480
I imagine there wouldn't be a

10:08.480 --> 10:10.680
charge - on account of all the
bother.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.120
No, of course not, Hubert...

10:15.120 --> 10:17.360
..anything for our most valued
customer.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.200
I've asked this morning's clients to
come back this afternoon.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.040
I don't understand why Siegfried
doesn't let Tristan run surgery.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.880
If there were two of us, we wouldn't
have to send anyone away.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.880
Mr Farnon has his ways...

10:34.880 --> 10:37.080
..maddening as they might be.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.480
It's best to let sleeping dogs lie.
Mm.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.200
I'm not sure I'd describe Siegfried
as a sleeping dog.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.000
Thanks.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.320
How's he getting on?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.880
I'd like to be able to give
Mr Hammond some good news.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.840
I don't think the bone is broken.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.560
We need to hope it's not infected.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.880
Seems like a nice chap.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.200
He does.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.240
He is.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.400
I better get a brew on before he
wears a hole in the floor.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.480
I'll do the best I can.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.600
102.5.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.880
Stethoscope.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.240
Thank you, Tristan.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.000
Pandhi said her insides are blocked
up,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.800
gave her some linseed oil to
grease the wheels.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.920
Really?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.680
Well, that's one way of doing it,
I suppose.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.880
And that's not the treatment you'd
prescribe?

11:39.880 --> 11:42.560
Well, we all have our different
approaches, Colonel.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.160
And different degrees of success
that go with them.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.200
COW MOOS

11:49.400 --> 11:50.640
Yes, I thought so.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.320
You're struggling, aren't you, old
girl?

11:52.320 --> 11:54.280
Stomach powders. Coming right up.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.480
I'm afraid there's definitely
a blockage.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.680
It could be she's had too much
roughage and that's bunged

11:58.680 --> 12:01.320
her up or there could be a wire or
something else caught up inside.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.000
Well, it sounds serious.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.600
More common than you'd think.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.960
Did Pandhi not mention the
possibility?

12:06.960 --> 12:10.720
I told my stock man to wait for you,
Farnon.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.960
Lesson learned.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.520
We'll start off with the powders to
help her work it through and

12:14.520 --> 12:17.640
if that doesn't shift it, I'm afraid
we'll have to come back and operate.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.400
COW MOOS

12:29.960 --> 12:31.000
Mr Hammond?

12:35.160 --> 12:37.320
Oh, noticed the timing's off.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.600
Well, I put it forward every
morning.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.880
Well, I could fix it for you, if you
like?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.200
Oh, I've got used to it now.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.400
Sometimes I put it forward more
than I should

12:46.400 --> 12:49.440
to get them out the house sooner.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.160
Well...

12:51.160 --> 12:53.520
..there speaks a woman wise to the
world.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.440
Wise to the lot I've been lumbered
with, certainly.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.640
Sorry, I've never been good at
waiting for news,

12:59.640 --> 13:01.040
I have to keep myself busy.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.040
You and me both.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.280
Mr Herriot is a wonderful vet.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.600
If you want any more milk, you just
let me know.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.760
I will.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.080
I'm sorry, in the rush,
I didn't catch your name.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.760
It's...

13:16.760 --> 13:18.640
..Audrey.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.960
Gerald.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.960
Sugar, I forgot the sugar.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.240
I'll just, um.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.840
No, no, I can leave that.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.440
And I'll come back with your, uh...

13:35.480 --> 13:37.160
..with the, um... Sugar.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.040
That's the chap.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.040
What's this? It's the list.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.920
The list, man. Don't look like that,
tell me what's next. Oh.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.960
Mr Dinsdale.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.480
Ah, yes, sow, aural haematoma.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.160
See? All up here.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.200
Why would you have Merrick
written twice?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.800
Well, I wouldn't.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.800
Unless this was left in your pocket
from last night.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.480
Which would suggest you were
supposed

14:15.480 --> 14:17.280
to go to Merrick's and not James?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.760
What're you doing?

14:35.760 --> 14:38.680
We must present our best self for
the clients, Siegfried.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.920
Morning.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.640
Oh, we thought it'd be a grand
adventure...

14:50.640 --> 14:52.800
..too young to know any better.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.760
You were in good company.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.760
I should never have been there in
the first place,

14:56.760 --> 14:58.960
I lied to the recruiting officer
about my age.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.600
Oh, God, you were one of those...

15:01.600 --> 15:03.280
..king, country.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.600
The usual nonsense.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.880
You know, funny thing is...

15:09.880 --> 15:11.720
..I wouldn't change it for the
world.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.120
Even though it left me hobbling
about.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.120
The struggle makes everything all
the more worth it.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.840
I'll keep telling myself that.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.360
Mr Hammond, you can come through.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.200
Thank you for the tea.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.920
We've patched him up.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.760
I'm worried there could be an
infection,

15:53.760 --> 15:56.360
the wound must've been open for some
time.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.480
If it spreads, it could poison the
blood stream.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.040
And then what?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.280
There's still a chance he could lose
the leg.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.000
Hm, better that than his life.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.760
Leave him with us for a few days.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.160
Hey, you'll be all right, Rock, lad.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.960
This nice gentleman and kind lady
are going to take care of you.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.480
And Jess will keep him company.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.720
Will we be seeing you at the dance
then?

16:33.720 --> 16:35.040
God willing.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.920
So long as you fulfil your
professional obligations first.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.160
And, by God, I naturally mean my
brother.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.560
Them eggs will not collect
themselves, you know.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.560
Should have kept her locked in
the coal shed.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.960
Our little Buttercup's in here.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.840
Now, that boil on her noggin's even
bigger than last time you were up.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.320
I didn't have the correct instrument
to complete the procedure.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.480
Here's our little lass now.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.920
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.520
Oh, yes ,I can see from here the
haematoma's even more engorged.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.960
Ah, looks fit to burst.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.120
I thought about going in and having
a go myself, like...

17:13.120 --> 17:14.720
..not for very long, mind.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.920
Yes, well, it's becoming apparent to
me

17:16.920 --> 17:19.520
now why you might have left your
scalpel at home last time.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.960
Thankfully, I believe we have it
here today. Mm.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.320
I don't know why you're
handing that to me,

17:26.320 --> 17:28.080
we learn by doing, little brother.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.040
I imagine she's called Buttercup
because uh...

17:34.040 --> 17:37.120
..well, despite appearances, she's
a tender and sweet soul at heart?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.000
Not as it goes.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.560
Nearly took me finger off once.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.840
If she gets hold of you, my advice
is to play dead.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.880
Unless you think she might actually
kill you,

17:47.880 --> 17:49.720
in which case, don't...

17:49.720 --> 17:51.440
..play dead, I mean.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.760
Right.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.880
Siegfried? Come now, Tristan.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.280
It's alright to be frightened,
for without fear,

17:58.280 --> 17:59.680
there cannot be courage.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.960
Ha, without courage, there can't be
pain.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.880
# I'm called Little Buttercup

18:20.880 --> 18:23.280
# Dear Little Buttercup. #

18:25.640 --> 18:27.200
Try not to startle it!

18:29.120 --> 18:31.280
Forget the pig, you startled me!

18:33.640 --> 18:36.240
Good Buttercup.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.240
Good pig.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.120
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

18:40.120 --> 18:41.680
Oh, God!

18:41.680 --> 18:43.920
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

18:43.920 --> 18:46.440
Oh, ah.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.080
Mr Dinsdale, I fear we may have to
return with anaesthetic

18:50.080 --> 18:52.960
to tame the beast before we operate.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.280
Oh, aye, when would that be then?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.240
Oh, not until this evening. What?

18:56.240 --> 18:58.040
No, Siegfried, we can't come back.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.680
Look, we're here now, I'll do it
now.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.640
He's either very brave or very
stupid.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.000
I believe it's a heady mixture of
both.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.440
No courage without fear.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.040
BUTTERCUP GRUNTS

19:25.040 --> 19:26.520
Good God!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.400
I admire your persistence

19:31.400 --> 19:34.240
but sometimes discretion is
the better part of valour.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.160
He's done it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.760
I'll be damned.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.000
I did?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.840
I mean, yes, I did.

19:45.840 --> 19:49.480
Yes, well, you made a bit of meal of
it but you got there in the end.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.520
Maybe I'll, uh, see you later.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.400
Tristan, it's this way.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.480
Frowning at it won't change it.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.960
It's from a friend of my mum's.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.640
He owns a vet's practice in Glasgow.
Hm.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.520
They've offered me a job.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.880
Well, I'm not surprised.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.920
Who wouldn't want you working for
them?

20:55.920 --> 20:58.400
Mum seems to have accepted it for
me.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.400
Oh, dear.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.800
The practice is run by a man
called Bill Weipers.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.320
He's on the board at Glasgow
Veterinary College.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.720
He employs modern methods
and equipment.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.600
He has an immaculate practice,

21:10.600 --> 21:12.480
sterile examination rooms, nurses,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.280
X-ray machine.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.760
And you got lumbered with us lot.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.640
well, it's just a different...

21:18.640 --> 21:21.600
..very different way of working.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.880
If you ever have any ideas about how

21:23.880 --> 21:26.320
you might improve this place,

21:26.320 --> 21:28.560
I'm sure Mr Farnon would hear you
out.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.360
If you catch him on a good day,
perhaps.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.640
It's more complicated than
that, Dad's struggling to get work.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.280
They're really struggling to
make ends meet.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.880
Well, they'd want you to be happy.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.520
As a parent, that's all you want for
your children.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.680
It feels so selfish.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.200
They spent their life savings
putting

21:48.200 --> 21:49.680
me through college, I owe it to
them.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.840
How long have you got to decide?

21:51.840 --> 21:53.080
I've got a few months to work out

21:53.080 --> 21:54.840
if there's something here worth
staying for.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.200
Or someone?

22:02.800 --> 22:04.840
Helen took the other one.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.280
How many cases have we got to get
through this afternoon?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.480
16.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.280
We'll use both examination rooms.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.240
While I'm treating an animal in
one...

22:22.240 --> 22:24.200
I'll settle the next one into the
other room.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.200
Once I've finished treatment, you
show them out, settle up the bill.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.040
I'll go straight through to deal
with the next. Righto.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.560
Hello, there.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.280
Hello.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.360
Good afternoon. Mr Herriot.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.400
Afternoon. Hello.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.560
Right, Mrs Kirkby, with a rabbit.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.680
That's me.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.760
Lovely.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.240
Miss Fearnly? Yes, lovely.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.840
Would you like to come through?

22:59.800 --> 23:01.240
Thank you, Mrs Jackson.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.920
Keep George warm by the fire,
that'll help speed up the waking
process.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.960
Thank you, love.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.160
It's Anne with Susie.
I'll be with you in a second.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.560
And don't you look happy about it.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.040
Sorry, I've been rushed off my feet.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.000
Hello, Susie.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.920
How're you getting on with those
pups of yours?

23:15.920 --> 23:18.120
They're all grand.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.240
First one you got out's
biggest of the lot.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.960
We named him James.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.880
I'll have to come up and visit him.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.960
Don't worry, Susie. Hey, we just
need to check how you're getting on.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.440
BELL RINGS

23:31.600 --> 23:33.760
Excuse me. Come on through.

23:35.120 --> 23:38.240
Hi, Helen. Hi.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.440
You look...

23:40.800 --> 23:42.520
It's good to see you.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.200
Shall I come in?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.960
Yes ,of course.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.480
I'm just finishing up, I won't be
long, I swear.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.280
She won't mind waiting.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.920
Oh, hello.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.640
Tea? I think so.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.840
Oh, you've certainly put
the weight back on.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.280
Sorry, Susie.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.200
That's very rude of me, isn't it?

24:17.360 --> 24:20.880
You know, if ever you're to get
beyond smiling at the girl...

24:20.880 --> 24:23.600
..you might eventually have to do
something about it.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.760
What happened to the other one?
What?

24:39.760 --> 24:41.440
I thought we could chat.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.400
Um..

24:43.400 --> 24:44.800
..yeah, great, OK.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.520
The other one, the barmaid,
Margaret?

24:47.520 --> 24:51.040
Maggie? I suppose she got sick of
you.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.440
Yeah, the thing about Maggie and me
is we're like ships in the night.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.800
Travelling our own separate
courses...

24:56.800 --> 24:58.560
..occasionally we...

24:58.560 --> 25:00.840
..crash into one another during
stormy weather.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.000
Meanwhile, you happily flit...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.360
..courting one girl and then the
next.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.520
First of all - no-one courts.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.480
Then what are they doing?
They date.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.720
We're not Americans.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.480
The world's changing.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.800
Not every evening spent in the
company of a woman

25:14.800 --> 25:17.840
necessarily has to end in something
particularly meaningful.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.520
In fact, most often it necessarily
doesn't.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.120
Then what's the point of it all?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.040
Fun.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.360
I understand that's a very alien
concept to you.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.680
I am fun, I'm perfectly bloody fun.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.680
You certainly used to be.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.080
Now I don't know what's happened.
What's that supposed to mean?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.680
You didn't used to be like this.

25:34.680 --> 25:35.760
Like what?

25:35.760 --> 25:37.800
Allowing Merrick to get a free
ride...

25:37.800 --> 25:39.600
..letting Pandhi rattle you and...

25:39.600 --> 25:41.320
..don't even get me started on the
women.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
Well, I imagine the problem's
getting you to stop.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.880
There's no spirit, the fight's gone.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.080
I assure you, it has not.
Really?

25:47.080 --> 25:49.960
Cos in the not too distant past,
you would've tackled that sow

25:49.960 --> 25:51.600
without a moment's hesitation,

25:51.600 --> 25:53.840
just to show people that you could.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.840
I'm not saying you're past it but...
You just did!

25:56.840 --> 25:58.760
Stuck in a rut maybe, one that I
thought Dorothy

25:58.760 --> 25:59.960
had got you out of it but...

25:59.960 --> 26:01.920
I'm not in a rut, there is no bloody
rut!

26:19.680 --> 26:21.880
Oh, I'll get that for you.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.680
Bye. Bye.

26:25.560 --> 26:29.320
Good evening, good evening, Mrs
Hall, Helen, a delight as ever.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.960
What happened to you?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.640
Fight with a pig.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.040
Is it hard to believe
I actually won?

26:35.040 --> 26:36.720
Bring your muddy things down,

26:36.720 --> 26:38.920
don't leave them festering on the
floor.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.200
It's been a long day.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.800
You must barely recognise me.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.480
Oh, I don't know Siegfried,

27:01.480 --> 27:03.680
I think you've weathered rather
well.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.080
You're very kind.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.080
How've you been?

27:10.400 --> 27:13.040
You know, one foot in front of the
other.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.200
Glad to hear it.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.480
There you are, James.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.920
About bloody time, poor Helen's
being bored silly waiting.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.120
I'm fine, Mrs Hall's been looking
after me.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.720
I had an emergency case,

27:22.720 --> 27:24.320
I've been playing catch up all day.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.280
You should really learn to deal
with these cases.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.800
No wonder we're struggling
to turn a profit.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.080
I would say, Siegfried,
if Tristan were here today,

27:31.080 --> 27:33.000
there would've been no need to
send anyone away.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.320
I want him with me until he's served
some time under my supervision.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.000
He's more than capable.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.760
Oh, see how they shower me with
praise?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.560
Perhaps this could wait for another
time?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.200
No, if James has got something he
wants

27:43.200 --> 27:45.720
to get off his chest, I'd like to
hear it.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.920
If Tristan were able to practise on
his own, we could take on more work.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.640
With the extra money, maybe we could
change a few things around here.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.920
Change? Why on earth would
we want to change?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.720
We could be working much more
efficiently,

27:55.720 --> 27:57.600
half of our equipment
is from the last century.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.920
So am I! Should we just toss me
out as well?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.720
I don't think James means that.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.480
Of course I don't.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.280
Siegfried, I learned more from you
in a year

28:05.280 --> 28:07.040
than I did in all the time I spent
at college.

28:07.040 --> 28:08.520
You flatter to deceive.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.000
It's true...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
..he told me as much before.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.760
I just want to be able to offer the
best care possible to our patients.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.760
Of course, as do I.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.800
You know I'm always open to new
ideas.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.840
HE CHUCKLES

28:23.880 --> 28:25.080
What?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.440
I am.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.640
Did you know we were the first
practice in whole of Yorkshire

28:30.640 --> 28:33.160
to have our own centrifuge for TB
testing?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.600
And I always put us forward
for the trial of new medications.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.160
We are a forward looking practice.

28:37.160 --> 28:41.400
And I am one who always looks ahead,
rather than behind - always.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.240
Semper progrediens!

28:43.240 --> 28:45.040
Always progressing. I know.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.240
Good. Well, that all seems settled
then.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.440
Now, shouldn't you be going before
something or other

28:49.440 --> 28:50.960
turns into a pumpkin?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.760
Semper progrediens!

29:02.120 --> 29:04.800
I believe he's fighting the
inevitable march of time.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.120
Oh, Lord help us.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.680
Go on, get on with you, I've my book
to read.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.760
James...

29:11.160 --> 29:12.640
..good luck.

29:12.640 --> 29:13.920
You sure you won't come?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.320
Oh, it's not for me.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.800
Listen to that, Jess.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.960
Isn't that wonderful?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.600
You'll be fine.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.520
Dorothy happen to mention
when she'll be returning?

30:24.520 --> 30:27.320
She has no plans at the moment.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.120
Oh, and how do you feel about that?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.520
How do I feel?

30:30.520 --> 30:33.320
When you care about someone very
much, you...

30:33.320 --> 30:35.960
People have these things,
feelings, emotions.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.280
Dorothy's a good friend - nothing
more.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.400
Understood.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.800
Well, then...

30:46.040 --> 30:47.880
..without fear...

30:49.080 --> 30:50.760
There can be no courage.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.760
Once more unto the breach.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.280
Diana.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.800
Good evening. Good evening to
you.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.280
You're looking stunning. Thank you.

31:02.280 --> 31:05.000
How many do you think he'll
dance with tonight?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.680
I've a feeling that once she gets a
hold of him...

31:07.680 --> 31:10.040
..she won't be letting go.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.960
My mum used to make me
go to tea dances with her.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.440
It used to be me and a room full of
old ladies.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.400
Mum used to make me stand up in
front of all of them

31:28.400 --> 31:29.840
and request songs from the singer.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.200
She didn't? I had to dance with
her...

31:32.200 --> 31:33.680
..and all her friends.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.360
That's why I find it the most
embarrassing

31:35.360 --> 31:36.440
thing in the world to do.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.920
It's probably why I'm terrible at
it.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.320
Oh, James, stop it.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.560
You're just saying it to make me
feel better.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.880
So, I apologise in advance for the
absolute shambles

31:43.880 --> 31:46.160
this'll inevitably be

31:46.160 --> 31:47.880
but would you like to dance?

31:47.880 --> 31:50.560
I promise once people see me
out there,

31:50.560 --> 31:53.400
no-one is going to be talking
about your wedding with Hugh.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.000
You'd really do that?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.200
You'd make a complete fool out of
yourself for me?

31:57.200 --> 31:58.640
Every single day.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.160
No Maggie tonight, then?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.760
No, no, boyfriend. Her, not me.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.840
That were very clever of you,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.520
tricking that pig in to bursting its
own bubble.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.760
There'd be some who'd mistake
it for you running away.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.480
Yes, well, it often takes brains
as well

32:29.480 --> 32:31.680
as brawn to solve these problems.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.840
Hm, I'd settle for a pretty face.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.480
How about it, then?

32:35.480 --> 32:38.760
Oh, sadly, Anabel, I'm just not
one of life's dancers.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.600
Oh, that's handy...

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
..because I'm not one for dancing
either.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.040
Outstanding.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.840
I've no idea what I'm doing.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.480
Don't worry, you're doing fine.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.680
Ooh. Sorry.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.560
It's alright, I've got another one.

33:02.560 --> 33:06.520
Look, try and loosen up, let
yourself go with it.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.040
That's it, that's better.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.720
Ooh!

33:10.720 --> 33:13.480
That's a little too much.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.800
I was sorry to hear about you
and your husband.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.000
Which was it, the housekeeper or the
gardener?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.920
Oh, I don't hold for such
tittle-tattle.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.320
Both, actually.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.720
I wouldn't blame him if it was the
gardener - he was quite the dish.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.600
There's even one going round

33:30.600 --> 33:33.400
where I've got old Len buried in the
basement.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.360
That's why no-one's seen him
for so long.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.880
I don't mind that one so much,

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
it keeps everybody on their toes.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.960
Farnon, we've got ourselves a bit of
a problem.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.520
Yes, Colonel, I believe we have.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.560
I was in the middle of a charming
conversation with

33:46.560 --> 33:49.840
this young lady and I've been rudely
interrupted.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.280
I beg your pardon?

33:51.280 --> 33:53.480
You can beg all you like,
you're not having it.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.040
Now, if you'll excuse me.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.720
You see, Colonel, what did I tell
you?

33:56.720 --> 33:58.320
He's lost it.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.640
I do apologise, Diana.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.280
Oh, no need.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.200
I love a bit of drama.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.760
Now hear this, Farnon, that cow is
still unwell.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.120
You told me it needed an operation.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.600
If you're not willing to come up
and sort her...

34:11.600 --> 34:13.800
..well, I can always take my custom
elsewhere.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.400
Custom suggests a transfer of money
for services rendered.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.560
I put a lot of work your way.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.480
Because we're the finest in the
district.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.720
We've three qualified vets and
enough work

34:23.720 --> 34:26.560
to necessitate the expansion of our
practice.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.280
We don't have to fight like jackals
over scraps left by others.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.440
If you really want the best possible
care for your animals,

34:33.440 --> 34:36.880
you can call during our normal
business hours.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.560
Otherwise, go with the reserve team.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.520
Good evening.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.280
Good evening? I'll give you good
evening!

34:45.280 --> 34:48.120
That was very impressive.
Thank you.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.560
Where are we going?

34:49.560 --> 34:52.320
No idea, I always like to sweep
out at the end of an argument.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.840
But since we're on the move, might I
suggest somewhere more salubrious?

34:55.840 --> 34:58.240
The Renniston, perhaps? Why not?

35:20.760 --> 35:22.240
Sorry again about your toes.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.440
Oh, it was great.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.600
You were great.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.240
It's been so long since...

35:27.240 --> 35:28.640
I really needed that.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.840
I'm glad.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.440
I'll, er, I'll fetch our drinks.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.120
Don't forget to come up for air.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.320
Goodnight, Tristan.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.680
Helen, been awhile. How've you been?

35:54.680 --> 35:55.800
Yeah, not bad. You?

35:55.800 --> 35:57.240
Oh, same as always...

35:57.240 --> 35:59.600
What do you say then, lass,
Fancy a turn around the floor?

35:59.600 --> 36:01.760
Oh, Fernley, this is... Hello.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.600
I'm James Herriot.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.000
Right, nice.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.520
I'm sorry.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.200
I didn't mean to... If you two are
together, then.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.200
Us? Oh, no, we're not.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.360
Are we? No, not at all.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.240
Only, we were known to have the odd
dance in the past.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.840
We even won a show together.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.400
Go on, at least he won't stand on
your toes.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.760
Right.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.120
Really, no trouble.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.840
Enjoy yourself.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.200
Thanks, James.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.520
Idiot.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.080
Tea, Siegfried?

36:54.080 --> 36:55.880
If you wouldn't mind, Tristan,

36:55.880 --> 36:57.800
thank you, very kind.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.320
When. Bless you.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.920
Good evening? Oh, very much so.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.880
How long's this going to go on for?
What?

37:26.920 --> 37:29.640
The inane expressions...

37:29.640 --> 37:31.440
..the smug sense of satisfaction.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.320
Mrs Hall, I would've thought
you'd be glad

37:33.320 --> 37:35.240
to hear we enjoyed ourselves last
night.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.440
Oh, it's enough to put me off my
breakfast.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.920
What about James?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.720
Did he enjoy himself?

37:40.720 --> 37:43.400
PHONE RINGS

37:51.760 --> 37:53.800
Darrowby, two, two, nine, seven.

37:58.840 --> 38:00.040
One moment.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.080
Mr Farnon.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.160
Colonel Merrick.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.760
Yes, what, is it?

38:08.920 --> 38:11.160
Oh, you do?

38:11.160 --> 38:14.240
Yes, well, I'll have to consult our
appointment diary first.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.240
Three o'clock?

38:20.920 --> 38:22.440
Breakfast's on the table.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.720
I'll be there in a minute.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.760
SIEGFRIED: See you then.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.040
How'd it go?

38:26.040 --> 38:28.680
He's doing all right, temperature's
down.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.000
The infection is starting
to clear up.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.320
You can call Mr Hammond and tell him
to pick him up later.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.720
That's not what I meant.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.080
Oh, love.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.440
It's alright.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.120
There are a lot of people Helen
needs to catch up with.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.040
SIEGFRIED: Herriot!

38:47.680 --> 38:49.080
Tristan!

38:49.080 --> 38:51.320
I'm literally three feet away from
you.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.000
I don't understand why you
have to bellow.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Don't be such a sensitive Sidney.
Here.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I've been keeping these back, one
each.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.960
And what are these for?

39:00.960 --> 39:03.840
You said you wanted us to modernise,
James?

39:03.840 --> 39:07.120
We're about to give the good Colonel
a show he'll never forget.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.720
Morning, Colonel.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.880
No Pandhi today?

39:16.880 --> 39:20.440
You're our vet, Farnon, for now, at
any rate.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.440
Well, I'm glad we managed to squeeze
you in.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.920
Yes, prepare the patient
for the operation.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.880
COW MOOS

39:45.000 --> 39:46.680
Thank you.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.360
Right. This is where we go in.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.800
I hope you aren't squeamish,
it's not for the faint hearted.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.240
I've seen blood before, you needn't
worry, I shan't faint.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.920
Now, you see the rumen exposed,
the cow's first stomach,

40:13.920 --> 40:15.840
you know they have four?

40:17.960 --> 40:20.680
Hang on Farnon, that doesn't look
too clever.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.520
Um, yes, it's probably just
a bit of ruminal gas.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.600
Wouldn't you say?

40:24.600 --> 40:26.080
Aye, probably.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.200
James, could I borrow you for a
second?

40:34.360 --> 40:37.640
Farnon, what was it you said,
the finest vet in the district?

40:37.640 --> 40:39.360
You're putting on a right show, now.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.760
Siegfried, do you not think
the good Colonel could

40:41.760 --> 40:44.840
benefit from seeing some of your
handiwork up close?

40:48.480 --> 40:52.280
You know, you really are full
of good ideas at the moment, James.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.280
Yes, Colonel, come in.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.200
Come in, that's it.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.800
That's it, a little closer.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.040
Scalpel, please.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.640
There we are. Thank you.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.000
Ready, Colonel?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.840
Oh, get on with it, Farnon.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.880
Oh, oh.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.000
COLONEL MERRICK: Absolutely...

41:23.800 --> 41:26.480
That's what the problem was. What do
you make of that?

41:26.480 --> 41:29.240
Farnon, what the...
It's Mr Farnon...

41:29.240 --> 41:31.120
..and my bill will be in the post.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.720
Well, I thought that went rather
well. Mm.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.160
Absolutely. Quite the show.
Text book.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.840
COLONEL MERRICK: God, absolutely
covered in the stuff.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.280
You'll have to keep him inside for a
few days

41:48.280 --> 41:49.720
to keep the wound clean.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.960
But I'm pleased with how the
infection is clearing up.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.440
Well, we can't thank you enough,
Mr Herriot.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.000
No trouble at all.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.200
Mrs Hall will show you out.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.920
Come on, then, Rock, here we go.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.440
It looks like these two have
become firm friends.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.840
Oh, we'll be sorry to see him go.
Won't we, Jess?

42:12.840 --> 42:15.040
I'm sure they could see each other
again.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.880
We could take them for a walk
together.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.480
One of the men usually take Jess
out.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.840
Ah, well, never mind.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.680
Maybe we'll see you out
and about, hey, Jess.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.200
When you grow tired of moving
your clock forward,

42:33.200 --> 42:35.120
let me know and I'll come fix it.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.200
Lost time is never found again.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.200
Come on, Rock, let's go.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.040
Oh, hold on.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.640
Oh, Helen, love, good to see you.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.800
Is James about?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.680
In there.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.080
Come in.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.480
I'm just clearing up, won't be a
second.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.720
Sorry we lost each other last night.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.240
Oh, it's fine, don't worry.

43:13.440 --> 43:15.960
It's been so long since I caught up
with everyone.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.360
I've known most of them since we
were kids.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.080
Oh, it's all right, I understand.

43:21.080 --> 43:25.080
It was the same for me when I went
home, seeing everyone again.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.720
It feels strange hearing you call
somewhere else home.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.320
You belong here.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.000
This is your home.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.560
I looked for you last night,
couldn't find you?

43:38.560 --> 43:40.320
I got dragged into a conversation
outside

43:40.320 --> 43:43.000
with Gene Gilbert and
Mr Summers.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.800
Once they get their teeth in,
they're hard to shake off.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.800
I would've liked to have danced with
you again.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.040
If your toes could take it.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.600
Last night were the first time in a
long time

44:00.600 --> 44:04.120
that I've felt like myself again...

44:04.120 --> 44:06.000
..and I was only there because of
you.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.760
Everything all right with
Miss Alderson?

45:04.760 --> 45:06.400
Aye, grand.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.760
Everything's grand.
