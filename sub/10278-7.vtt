E. R.

00:06.524 --> 00:08.144
- Previously on E. R.
- Have a sit ma'am.

00:08.145 --> 00:10.650
- Hold now.
- All right! All right! All right! Ok!

00:10.685 --> 00:12.305
How long has she been bipolar?

00:12.340 --> 00:13.646
Since I was a kid.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.341
- Psychiatrist?
- Yes.

00:16.343 --> 00:17.543
I don't need you.

00:17.544 --> 00:19.252
I don't want back surgery.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.755
Then I'd recommend
an outpatient procedure.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.111
Endoscopic surgery.

00:23.212 --> 00:24.407
Let's get him to O.R.

00:24.408 --> 00:25.997
And find me Elizabeth Corday.

00:25.998 --> 00:27.499
- Come on. Get out of my way.
- Hey! Hey.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.700
It's his nephew.

00:28.701 --> 00:32.264
We found some bleeding around his heart
and Peter's trying to repair it now.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.622
No!

00:55.155 --> 00:59.106
Hey. Reece woke up early.

00:59.952 --> 01:03.784
- I'll go make breakfast.
- Hey, no, no, no. I got it.

01:04.623 --> 01:07.625
- Why don't you go back to bed.
- There's no point.

01:08.128 --> 01:10.286
Do you want something
to help you sleep?

01:10.464 --> 01:11.923
No, no, no.

01:14.302 --> 01:16.378
Walt still asleep?

01:16.637 --> 01:19.841
Thought I'd come home early from
the hospital and help with dinner.

01:20.016 --> 01:23.931
- Thought you were going to Cleo's.
- I don't have to.

01:25.231 --> 01:30.308
I'm not making a Thanksgiving dinner.
Please go. Have Thanksgiving there.

01:30.486 --> 01:34.271
- Jackie, I'd rather be here.
- Please, go.

01:39.330 --> 01:40.658
Hey.

01:51.052 --> 01:54.836
- Have you seen the Tylenol?
- I took the last two.

01:55.014 --> 01:58.099
- Did you put it on the list?
- No.

01:58.310 --> 02:04.100
- That neck still bothering you?
- I know. No more hockey games.

02:04.275 --> 02:08.107
There you go. Greene's eggs and ham.

02:08.904 --> 02:11.859
I'm sorry, Mark. I'm just not hungry.

02:12.325 --> 02:14.401
Well, I hope you have an
appetite tonight...

02:14.577 --> 02:18.790
...because I am gonna be grilling
filet mignon and baking potatoes.

02:18.958 --> 02:22.374
On Thanksgiving?
No turkey, no cranberries?

02:22.545 --> 02:24.503
No, we did that last year.

02:24.673 --> 02:29.501
- What? No yams? No pumpkin pie?
- Pumpkin pie, yes.

02:29.678 --> 02:32.549
Whoever it is, don't buy anything.

02:33.766 --> 02:36.139
- Dr. Elizabeth Corday?
- Yes.

02:36.519 --> 02:38.311
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:40.565 --> 02:44.350
- What is it?
- Some sort of letter.

02:44.528 --> 02:48.442
It says, "Notice to the defendant-"

02:50.452 --> 02:52.361
Oh, my God...

02:53.121 --> 02:56.242
I'm being sued for malpractice.

03:06.928 --> 03:11.757
I'll keep taking my medication.
I won't be a burden.

03:14.436 --> 03:17.604
Come on. At least let me
stay through the weekend.

03:18.775 --> 03:23.236
I can't go back. I lost my job.
Your brother's not even talking to me.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.609
You can't throw me out.
I'm your mother.

03:28.787 --> 03:33.614
I put the bus ticket
and some money in your purse.

03:33.833 --> 03:36.954
And you'll have to find a job
as soon as you get there.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.878
I've been here for a week.
I know how hard things are for you.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.886
- I know what you're going through.
- We've been through this.

03:44.053 --> 03:46.544
- I want to be here for you.
- I have to go. Excuse me.

03:46.848 --> 03:49.256
- Honey, please.
- Here. Take my coat.

03:49.643 --> 03:51.137
Okay?

03:55.775 --> 03:57.732
I love you.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.952
I love you.

04:20.345 --> 04:23.262
E. R.

05:08.649 --> 05:11.222
- Morning, guys.
- Hey.

05:12.236 --> 05:15.356
- Good morning.
- You're getting pretty good at that.

05:15.531 --> 05:17.903
I've been practicing.
Are we still on for tonight?

05:18.075 --> 05:20.911
Yeah. Actually, I'm looking
forward to meeting your parents.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.787
You'll like them.

05:23.332 --> 05:26.002
- Their flight get in okay?
- Picked them up this morning.

05:26.169 --> 05:28.291
Hope you don't mind going out
to my cousin's.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.084
- No.
- How's Jackie?

05:34.011 --> 05:36.881
She's okay with you
not being home tonight?

05:37.472 --> 05:39.382
She doesn't want me around.

05:40.852 --> 05:42.595
I'm sorry.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.606
- I gotta get him up to Daycare.
- Okay.

05:49.111 --> 05:51.649
- Chen and Carter are late.
- It's pouring outside.

05:51.823 --> 05:55.488
You know, when I was a Resident,
I left early during inclement weather.

05:55.660 --> 05:57.035
- It's a mess out there!
- Yeah.

05:57.203 --> 05:58.484
- Finally.
- Sorry I'm late.

05:58.663 --> 06:02.329
John, got a drunk with a hand lac in
Sutures. Chen, a breast abscess in 4.

06:02.501 --> 06:05.668
If you need an Attending, Kovac is
here. Greene is due in an hour.

06:05.838 --> 06:07.747
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

06:07.923 --> 06:09.916
- Taking Mr. Morgan up?
- He's a bit anxious.

06:10.092 --> 06:12.382
- They were gonna murder Bernadine.
- He's delusional.

06:12.554 --> 06:14.593
Threatened to blow up
his neighbor's house.

06:14.764 --> 06:17.601
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No. Not really.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.639
- You look different somehow.
- Contacts. I broke my glasses.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.687
- Suits you.
- Thank you.

06:22.857 --> 06:25.183
- Abby. How's your mother doing?
- Better.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.436
She left for Florida this morning.

06:27.612 --> 06:29.688
I'm sorry about what happened
the other day.

06:29.865 --> 06:34.860
Don't apologize. She has a disease.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

06:40.835 --> 06:43.244
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:45.508 --> 06:49.257
- Did you put her on the bus?
- Yep.

06:50.055 --> 06:52.213
- Are you free-?
- Would you like to go-?

06:54.309 --> 06:55.720
Dinner?

06:58.981 --> 07:02.814
- Think anything'll be open?
- I think Doc Magoo's.

07:04.362 --> 07:07.316
I think that's kind of depressing
on Thanksgiving.

07:10.202 --> 07:12.658
I could cook at my place.

07:12.830 --> 07:16.081
Rescue's pulling up.
A guy got hit riding his bike.

07:16.543 --> 07:20.623
- Call her! She's waiting for me!
-30-year-old. Bicycle versus minivan.

07:20.797 --> 07:22.874
Bent the bike
and pinned him against a pole.

07:23.050 --> 07:25.541
- Vitals?
- BP's 100/60.

07:25.719 --> 07:27.262
Gave him two liters.

07:27.429 --> 07:29.423
Cut off as much of the bike
as we could.

07:29.599 --> 07:32.635
I can get it. Four-by-fours.
Looks like the femoral artery.

07:32.811 --> 07:35.053
Abby? Abby?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.099
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?

07:38.275 --> 07:40.019
Come on, Abby!

07:40.402 --> 07:41.981
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

07:42.280 --> 07:45.447
Get four units of O-neg. I need
a thigh cuff and a Doppler scope.

07:45.617 --> 07:47.075
Ask for dry clothes at the desk...

07:47.243 --> 07:48.822
- ... and wait.
- I tried to get on the bus.

07:48.996 --> 07:51.487
- I can't leave you, Abby.
- Pulse is 124 and thready.

07:51.665 --> 07:54.336
- Abby?
- Set me up for a central line and-

07:54.502 --> 07:55.783
Slow down, damn it!

07:57.297 --> 08:00.001
Set me up for a central line
and prime the rapid infuser.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.627
- We need X-ray to clear the neck.
- I'll get the Foley.

08:03.846 --> 08:07.298
- Call Maintenance for a hacksaw.
- Here we go. On my count.

08:07.475 --> 08:09.267
- One, two, three.
- Want a second line?

08:09.436 --> 08:11.808
Yes. Set a trauma panel,
and type and cross for six.

08:14.358 --> 08:16.979
That smarts like a son of a bitch.

08:17.152 --> 08:20.653
I gave you lidocaine, Mr. Florea.
It should be pretty numb.

08:20.824 --> 08:24.192
- I can give you some more.
- Yeah, please.

08:24.369 --> 08:28.663
It hurts like hell. So does my knee.

08:28.832 --> 08:33.078
- What's the matter with your knee?
- I twisted it when I fell off the curb.

08:33.254 --> 08:36.837
Dropped my Turkey, cut my hand.

08:38.176 --> 08:40.501
You cut yourself on a turkey?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.546
- Wild Turkey.
- Wild Turkey.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.761
I was drinking it on account of
it's Thanksgiving.

08:47.228 --> 08:51.096
The Pilgrims didn't envision the liquid
when they established the holiday.

08:51.274 --> 08:52.852
How about something for my pain?

08:53.027 --> 08:55.352
What would you like this time?
Percocet or Demerol?

08:55.529 --> 08:56.940
I'm allergic to Percocet.

08:57.114 --> 09:01.693
This is Mr. Florea's third time in
here this week complaining of pain.

09:01.869 --> 09:04.621
Really? I see.

09:04.789 --> 09:06.866
I didn't realize it was that serious.

09:07.042 --> 09:10.043
In that case, I'll refer you to a
clinic to help you manage it.

09:10.212 --> 09:13.629
I don't need no damn clinic.
I need something for my knee.

09:15.551 --> 09:19.597
We'll get you some x-rays.
Then I'll give you some Motrin.

09:20.224 --> 09:23.509
- You think I'm an addict?
- I think you have a drug problem.

09:23.769 --> 09:26.308
What do you know about my pain?

09:27.023 --> 09:29.062
I'll be back.
You want to finish him up?

09:29.233 --> 09:30.893
Sure.

09:36.575 --> 09:40.905
Randi? Randi, excuse me. Do you have
a bag I could put these wet things in?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.452
Did they just bring in a man
from a bike accident?

09:43.624 --> 09:46.199
You'll have to sit in Chairs.
I'll be right back.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.915
- He's in the Trauma Room.
- Where is that?

09:51.926 --> 09:55.591
Well, I'll show you. Right this way.
I saw them bring him in.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.174
Was he badly hurt?

09:57.348 --> 10:01.133
I know they're doing absolutely
everything they can for him.

10:02.479 --> 10:05.516
I got two units of type-specific.

10:05.691 --> 10:08.396
- Okay. Neck is clear.
- Pulse ox is down to 88.

10:08.569 --> 10:10.443
Bag him while we set up for intubation.

10:10.529 --> 10:12.737
Twenty of etomidate, 100 of sux.

10:12.908 --> 10:16.407
Got a quart of melted
strawberry ice cream.

10:16.620 --> 10:20.453
- His name is Jim Peakins.
- He is relaxed. Take off the collar.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.793
Abby, give me some cricoid pressure.

10:25.964 --> 10:27.293
Whoa! Big neck lac.

10:28.091 --> 10:29.633
It's hard to see the cords.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.629
Direct your pressure to the right.

10:32.138 --> 10:36.598
- How's that?
- Better. Looks like a foreign body.

10:36.768 --> 10:39.140
- McGills.
- Sats are 82 and falling.

10:39.312 --> 10:40.593
Hold on.

10:40.939 --> 10:42.350
There.

10:44.318 --> 10:46.690
You pulled my gauze
through his neck wound.

10:46.862 --> 10:48.689
Open up some lap pads.

10:49.031 --> 10:52.733
I'm in. Bag him.
Abby, call for a vent.

10:54.579 --> 10:57.996
- Sats are still low.
- Decreased breath sounds to the right.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.041
Chest-tube tray.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.833
- Okay, start chest compressions.
- We're out.

11:03.006 --> 11:05.877
- Charge paddles to 200.
- I'll get one.

11:06.051 --> 11:07.509
- Clear.
- Clear.

11:08.303 --> 11:09.584
What are you doing here?

11:09.764 --> 11:12.800
The gentleman's wife showed up
and there was no one to help her.

11:12.975 --> 11:16.345
I'm not his wife. I hit him. It was
an accident. I didn't even see him.

11:16.521 --> 11:19.641
Randi, can you sit this woman
down in the hall, please?

11:19.816 --> 11:22.225
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Ma'am, ma'am, this way.

11:23.195 --> 11:25.521
- Abby. Abby, I need to talk with you.
- Not now.

11:25.698 --> 11:29.032
It's important. I'm not going
anywhere, Abby. I'm staying here.

11:29.202 --> 11:30.696
No good deed goes unpunished.

11:30.871 --> 11:34.702
I step in, I clean up your mess,
and I end up named in your lawsuit.

11:34.874 --> 11:38.209
- I'm so sorry.
- "Sorry" won't save your ass, or mine.

11:38.379 --> 11:42.080
- I take full responsibility.
- How noble of you.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.970
The guy's a gimp. He walks in
with a little bit of a backache.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.932
He'll be wheeled out in a wheelchair.

11:50.101 --> 11:51.974
Do you know how that'll
play for a jury?

11:52.144 --> 11:55.229
- Not well.
- Not well?

11:55.482 --> 11:59.562
When his lawyers get through,
you'll be lucky to sling fish and chips.

11:59.736 --> 12:01.979
I thought the procedure
had gone smoothly.

12:02.156 --> 12:05.572
Well, it was a screaming success
if your desired outcome was paralysis.

12:05.743 --> 12:08.661
I'll talk to Risk Management
so you're not implicated.

12:08.830 --> 12:11.665
- Are you almost through?
- One minute, love.

12:15.463 --> 12:17.788
Do not talk to Risk Management.

12:17.965 --> 12:20.420
Do not discuss this case with anyone.
Am I clear?

12:20.885 --> 12:22.261
Yes.

12:22.679 --> 12:24.054
Surfer.

12:24.848 --> 12:27.006
Couldn't be just some
fat-assed couch potato.

12:27.184 --> 12:30.055
And don't even think about
paging me during the weekend.

12:30.229 --> 12:32.802
Ready, Nikki? Let's go.

12:37.529 --> 12:39.735
- Still in V-fib.
- How long has it been?

12:39.906 --> 12:43.525
- Twenty-five minutes.
- Two liters out of the chest tube.

12:43.702 --> 12:45.909
Okay. Shock once more
and then we'll call it.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.034
- How about a thoracotomy?
- Not with blunt trauma.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.704
Charged.

12:51.377 --> 12:52.706
Clear.

12:55.549 --> 12:58.716
- Asystole.
- Okay, that's it.

12:58.886 --> 13:02.635
Time of death, 10:57.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.476
Any family here?

13:06.645 --> 13:09.765
No. Just the woman who hit him.
She's waiting out in the hall.

13:16.406 --> 13:18.445
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

13:18.616 --> 13:21.571
The man on the bicycle
was profoundly injured.

13:21.745 --> 13:25.446
We did everything we could, but
he didn't respond to the treatment.

13:25.625 --> 13:26.953
Oh, God!

13:27.126 --> 13:29.285
He died a few minutes ago.

13:33.675 --> 13:38.421
My baby was crying and
I turned around. I didn't see him.

13:38.598 --> 13:42.097
- I'm sorry.
- God, I didn't see him!

13:42.852 --> 13:46.518
Sweetie, it's all right.
It's all right. It wasn't your fault.

13:46.690 --> 13:48.350
- I didn't see him.
- It was raining.

13:48.525 --> 13:51.563
- It wasn't your fault. It's all right.
- My God!

13:51.738 --> 13:53.446
It's all right.

13:54.032 --> 13:58.030
- You didn't see him.
- Oh, my God!

13:58.787 --> 14:01.871
It was raining. You didn't see him.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.137
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

14:17.517 --> 14:19.556
Then my mother showed up.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.474
- Is she going back?
- Yeah.

14:28.654 --> 14:30.777
Think it'll ever stop?

14:31.407 --> 14:32.783
What?

14:33.785 --> 14:35.160
The rain.

14:36.204 --> 14:38.660
Has to stop eventually.

14:41.209 --> 14:43.083
I hope so.

14:44.088 --> 14:47.089
I'm telling you, my knee still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

14:47.258 --> 14:51.339
That's why you're going to X-ray,
Mr. Florea. Conni? Can you take him up?

14:51.513 --> 14:53.755
- Call Transport.
- They're short-staffed.

14:53.932 --> 14:56.008
I'm suffering. Stop torturing me.

14:56.184 --> 14:59.435
Yeah, yeah. Catch you later
when you get back with your films.

14:59.772 --> 15:03.605
Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Chen.
Is she working today?

15:03.777 --> 15:06.564
She's with a patient.
Just take a seat in Chairs.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.114
Thanks.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.371
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:17.709 --> 15:22.787
- Do you work here?
- No. These? I got caught in the rain.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.752
- My daughter works here.
- So does mine.

15:25.927 --> 15:27.800
- Really?
- Jing-Mei Chen.

15:28.012 --> 15:30.682
The cute one. Pregnant.

15:30.849 --> 15:32.427
- What?
- You must be thrilled.

15:32.601 --> 15:36.646
I would be so excited if one of my
children made me a grandmother.

15:36.814 --> 15:40.313
I don't think of myself as old enough
to be a grandmother. But I am.

15:40.484 --> 15:42.857
You must be thinking of someone else.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.440
Jing-Mei!

15:45.615 --> 15:47.157
Mommy.

15:48.828 --> 15:53.869
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing here?

15:54.083 --> 15:57.453
I wanted to invite you
for Thanksgiving dinner.

15:57.629 --> 16:01.793
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Because I didn't know how.

16:03.302 --> 16:04.761
Come home tonight.

16:04.929 --> 16:07.550
- Is everyone coming?
- Yes.

16:07.723 --> 16:10.760
No, Mommy. Not with all
those people there. Please.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.509
- They're your family.
- I can't.

16:14.022 --> 16:15.766
- Please?
- No, I just can't.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.851
- No, please.
- I need a hand in Exam 1.

16:18.027 --> 16:21.194
I gotta go. Don't tell Ba-Ba.

16:22.365 --> 16:24.773
- We miss you.
- I know.

16:27.037 --> 16:28.864
You looked like you needed some help.

16:29.039 --> 16:31.115
- Thank you, Carter.
- No problem.

16:31.917 --> 16:34.290
Did you page me?
I've got an appy in 10 minutes.

16:34.462 --> 16:38.590
Debby Marlin is here. You operated
on her last year for breast cancer.

16:38.758 --> 16:41.713
- What's she doing back?
- She's in pain. Mets to the spine.

16:41.887 --> 16:43.796
Thought you'd like to know.

16:49.437 --> 16:52.522
- Hi, Dr. Benton.
- Hey. How are you doing?

16:52.690 --> 16:55.647
Terrible. I went to my pharmacy
this morning...

16:55.734 --> 16:58.777
and they told me they couldn't refill
my morphine prescription.

16:58.948 --> 17:00.324
Why not?

17:00.492 --> 17:03.991
Well, they don't carry narcotics
anymore. Too many robberies.

17:04.162 --> 17:07.282
I gave her a shot of morphine
but it's barely taken the edge off.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.996
All right. Let me see.
How much did you give her?

17:10.169 --> 17:11.544
Ten.

17:13.131 --> 17:15.253
You contacted your oncologist?

17:15.425 --> 17:18.675
I just got the service.
He's away for the holiday weekend.

17:18.845 --> 17:21.930
All right. Come on. All right.
Give her another 10.

17:22.098 --> 17:25.385
If she's feeling better,
send her home with Percocet.

17:26.104 --> 17:30.267
You mean I have to come all the way
back here tomorrow for my medicine?

17:30.525 --> 17:33.147
I'm sorry, the outpatient
pharmacy's closed today.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.441
Can we admit her for pain control?

17:37.241 --> 17:39.033
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

17:39.202 --> 17:41.111
Let's admit her to Medicine.

17:41.287 --> 17:43.659
- Thank you, Dr. Benton.
- You're welcome.

17:43.831 --> 17:46.121
The weasel warned me
not to speak to anyone.

17:46.293 --> 17:48.333
- Are you gonna listen?
- Do I have a choice?

17:48.504 --> 17:51.707
- You're being sued. You must respond.
- Romano insisted he'd handle it.

17:51.882 --> 17:54.635
Yeah, sure. Cover his ass
and hang you out to dry.

17:54.802 --> 17:57.720
Let me talk to my buddy Dave Medler.
He's in Risk Management.

17:57.889 --> 18:01.341
- Off the record. See what he thinks.
- Thanks.

18:01.643 --> 18:04.893
- You look tired.
- So do you.

18:05.064 --> 18:08.398
- I shouldn't be dragging you into this.
- We're getting married, okay?

18:08.568 --> 18:12.151
- Your problems are my problems.
- Mark, Ortho's waiting in 2.

18:12.322 --> 18:14.030
See you later.

18:29.883 --> 18:32.007
- What's the score?
- Texas up by 6.

18:32.178 --> 18:34.171
I see Judy's back
for a return engagement.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.182
Elvis' greatest hits.
Conni's serving turkey in the lounge.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.427
I'll wait for dinner.
Any ETA on my x-rays?

18:39.603 --> 18:41.809
- No.
- I got three patients waiting.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.686
- There's only one file clerk.
- You don't look that busy.

18:44.859 --> 18:47.979
- You want to cover the phones?
- I'll get the x-rays myself.

18:49.113 --> 18:50.525
You all right?

18:50.699 --> 18:53.451
- Look at her sitting there.
- How long will you make her wait?

18:53.619 --> 18:55.695
- She should be on a bus.
- Will you talk to her?

18:55.871 --> 18:58.493
I've talked to her all my life.
There's nothing to say.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.623
Would you call Security
to move her out?

19:00.793 --> 19:02.952
- Security?
- What?

19:07.259 --> 19:11.044
- Abby. Abby. Abby, listen.
- No! What are you trying to prove?

19:11.222 --> 19:13.843
- You' re my daughter. I care about you.
- Do you mind?

19:14.016 --> 19:17.221
- I'll take my medicine, I'll get a job.
- That's not gonna happen.

19:17.396 --> 19:21.440
I'm not going anywhere until you talk
with me. Damn it, I'm your mother.

19:21.608 --> 19:23.483
- Deal with me.
- Go back to Florida.

19:23.653 --> 19:25.230
I need a monitored bed.

19:25.404 --> 19:26.649
Trauma 1 's open.

19:26.823 --> 19:29.575
- Lie still. We're trying to help.
- Put him on the dynamap.

19:29.743 --> 19:31.403
- Get an ultrasound.
- What have you got?

19:31.578 --> 19:33.950
25-year-old pharmacy tech
found in Central Supply.

19:34.122 --> 19:37.623
BP's 260/140. He's combative,
not moving his right side.

19:37.794 --> 19:39.204
And he's vomiting.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.674
Increased intracranial pressure.
Probably a brain bleed.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.593
He needs intubation,
a Nipride drip and a stat head CT.

19:45.761 --> 19:48.086
- Go away!
- We need hard restraints.

19:48.263 --> 19:51.680
How about we paralyze and intubate?
Six of Versed, 100 of sux.

19:51.851 --> 19:54.971
- Great.
- Now we know why his pressure's high.

19:55.146 --> 19:58.064
- Want a tox screen?
- It's probably coke or crystal meth.

19:58.233 --> 20:01.436
- Paralytics are on board.
-8-0 ET tube.

20:05.616 --> 20:07.656
- Damn it!
- That's all right. I'll get another.

20:07.827 --> 20:10.663
- You all right?
- Yeah. Just a little dizzy.

20:10.831 --> 20:13.238
- You want to sit down?
- No.

20:13.416 --> 20:17.913
- Okay. I'm gonna be sick.
- Get an emesis basin.

20:23.386 --> 20:25.628
- Pulse ox down to 86.
- Bag him.

20:25.805 --> 20:27.929
- That's okay. Sit down.
- I'm sorry.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.844
Put your head down.

20:30.311 --> 20:32.802
- His sats are still dropping.
- Chuny, can you get help?

20:33.481 --> 20:35.391
- Go ahead.
- You have to intubate.

20:35.650 --> 20:38.437
Randi, find a doctor! We need
some help in Trauma 1 now!

20:38.612 --> 20:41.697
I can't see the cords. I need suction.
There's a lot of vomit.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.490
Try a straight blade.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.197
Lydia, we need a vent.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.910
- How's that Nipride drip coming?
- Working on it.

20:49.082 --> 20:53.293
- What do you need?
- Difficult intubation. Corday's sick.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.956
Go lie down. I've got it.
Take one more look.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.381
If you can't get it, I'm here.

20:59.844 --> 21:02.715
Can I have a cords tube? Okay.

21:06.768 --> 21:09.094
- Bag him.
- Good.

21:16.279 --> 21:20.657
Knee film on Mr. Florea looks normal.
I knew it.

21:20.868 --> 21:24.118
- Take a look at his ultrasound.
- I didn't order an ultrasound.

21:24.288 --> 21:26.365
He was in a lot of pain.

21:29.127 --> 21:30.870
Oh, man!

21:31.337 --> 21:36.795
He's got a clot from the popliteal fossa
to the femoral vein?

21:39.556 --> 21:41.762
I thought he was drug-seeking.
Where is he?

21:41.933 --> 21:44.887
A pain in the ass. He tried to bum
an El token from the clerk.

21:45.061 --> 21:47.220
When the guy wouldn't give,
he got pissed off.

21:47.398 --> 21:49.189
You just let him leave?

21:49.358 --> 21:51.397
- I'm not a hall monitor.
- Damn it!

22:01.288 --> 22:03.080
Mr. Florea!

22:04.083 --> 22:05.875
Mr. Florea!

22:09.464 --> 22:11.291
Mr. Florea!

22:11.758 --> 22:13.039
Mr. Florea!

22:15.012 --> 22:17.681
Excuse me. Mr. Florea!

22:20.101 --> 22:22.722
Excuse me. Mr. Florea!

22:22.896 --> 22:25.470
Out of my way.
Move away from him.

22:25.649 --> 22:27.357
Mr. Florea?

22:31.739 --> 22:33.282
Mr. Florea?

22:33.992 --> 22:39.331
Randi, it's Carter. I'm at the
El station. Send a gurney right away.

22:41.375 --> 22:43.118
- What happened?
- Found him at the El.

22:43.293 --> 22:45.916
- Drinking again?
- No, he left AMA. He's got a leg clot.

22:46.089 --> 22:48.414
- It must have traveled to his lung.
- Sats are 78.

22:48.591 --> 22:52.720
Get the TPA box ready. Mix up the TPA,
run 100 milligrams for two hours.

22:52.888 --> 22:56.506
- I've got to do the checklist first.
- No, no. There's no time for that.

22:56.683 --> 22:59.769
- He's altered, a contraindication.
- He's altered because of the PE.

22:59.938 --> 23:02.310
- Not enough oxygen to his brain.
- I won't give it.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.890
- He may be bleeding internally.
- I'll give it.

23:05.069 --> 23:07.738
- I'm not signing my name to this chart.
- Then don't!

23:13.244 --> 23:16.162
You know the pharmacy dude that
Corday and Abby were working on?

23:16.330 --> 23:17.874
- With the crack pipe?
- Yeah?

23:18.041 --> 23:22.039
He was cooking crystal meth in the
basement pharmacy. Whole lab set up.

23:22.212 --> 23:23.838
- You're kidding.
- Bad news.

23:24.007 --> 23:26.580
Debby Marlin's HMO
wouldn't authorize admission.

23:26.759 --> 23:29.333
- Who?
- Breast cancer with spine mets.

23:29.512 --> 23:31.920
HMO said she should be managed
as an outpatient.

23:32.099 --> 23:35.053
If she's in pain,
have her contact her HMO tomorrow.

23:35.227 --> 23:39.439
Before or after she takes the bus
across town to refill her prescription?

23:39.607 --> 23:41.932
Cleo, Cleo, we've done all we can.

23:42.109 --> 23:44.946
She's got end-stage breast cancer,
Peter. She's in pain.

23:45.113 --> 23:48.150
I know. But she's gonna have
to take it up with her HMO.

23:48.325 --> 23:52.537
She'd be better off without insurance.
We'd admit her and County would pay.

23:52.705 --> 23:55.113
Doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

23:55.625 --> 24:00.537
- How's your sister doing, Peter?
- You know. As well as can be expected.

24:02.132 --> 24:05.502
Randi, how long is Abby's mother
gonna be sitting in Chairs?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.587
I bet three days.
Want to join the pool?

24:07.763 --> 24:09.045
No, thanks.

24:12.310 --> 24:14.884
- You're giving TPA?
- He's got a pulmonary embolus.

24:15.063 --> 24:16.642
- Are you sure?
- He's got a DVT...

24:16.816 --> 24:19.817
...he's hypoxic and has a right
ventricular strain on the 12-lead.

24:20.278 --> 24:21.737
What are his coags?

24:21.905 --> 24:24.147
- What's his head CT show?
- I don't know.

24:24.324 --> 24:26.993
- Stop the TPA. He could bleed out.
- Pulse ox is down to 72.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.442
This is his only chance.

24:28.621 --> 24:31.538
You know nothing about his history.
You could kill him.

24:31.707 --> 24:34.793
- Stop. Thoracic may do a thrombectomy.
- He's hypoxic on 100 percent oxygen.

24:34.962 --> 24:36.621
- He'll never make it!
- We must try.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.372
- He'll arrest!
- I'm the Attending.

24:39.549 --> 24:42.302
Pulse ox is going up to 80.
Heart rate's steady at 72.

24:44.430 --> 24:47.966
Just pray he didn't bleed
in his brain.

24:55.151 --> 24:56.431
Thanks.

24:59.280 --> 25:02.198
- I feel like such a klutz.
- These things happen.

25:02.367 --> 25:06.447
My husband likes celery in stuffing,
so I'm chopping away, and whack!

25:06.621 --> 25:08.994
Next thing I know
there's blood everywhere.

25:09.166 --> 25:14.043
I should've stuck to my oyster recipe.
But Sam likes a traditional stuffing.

25:14.214 --> 25:19.588
You can tell a lot about people by
their stuffing. My mother hates sage.

25:19.761 --> 25:22.549
And I'm not too fond
of nuts or raisins.

25:22.723 --> 25:25.214
T o tell you the truth,
I don't like a lot of that...

25:25.392 --> 25:29.012
...fancy stuff thrown in
like eggs or dried fruit.

25:29.189 --> 25:33.103
How about you, doctor?
What kind of stuffing do you like?

25:33.903 --> 25:35.730
Dr. Greene?

25:37.031 --> 25:38.988
What do you prefer?

25:46.250 --> 25:48.456
Dr. Greene,
lab needs another red top on Caine.

25:54.259 --> 25:57.544
Dr. Greene,
can I run my asthma patient by you?

25:58.304 --> 26:00.215
We've got a lady with syncope in 4.

26:32.802 --> 26:34.427
Mark, do you have a minute?

26:34.596 --> 26:37.051
- I got into a thing with Carter-
- Not now.

26:43.772 --> 26:46.181
- Are you going anywhere tonight?
- I don't think so.

26:46.359 --> 26:48.482
Stop by. I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner for 30.

26:48.653 --> 26:50.028
Thirty people? How?

26:50.196 --> 26:52.439
Takeout from Chicago Chicken
on my good china.

26:52.616 --> 26:57.159
- Abby, please talk with me. Please.
- Please don't do this to me again.

26:57.329 --> 27:00.035
All right. I lost my apartment.
I've been evicted.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.580
- I have no place to go.
- I don't want to hear it.

27:02.752 --> 27:06.169
- Why are you so damn stubborn?
- It's called self-protection.

27:06.507 --> 27:11.502
I did the best I could. I took
care of you and Eric all by myself.

27:11.679 --> 27:13.802
Excuse me, Mom.
We took care of you.

27:13.973 --> 27:18.553
You always had a place to stay, food
and clothes. I worked hard for that.

27:18.729 --> 27:22.394
- When you were on your meds.
- I tried to be a good mother every day.

27:22.566 --> 27:28.154
Abby, now, you listen to me.
There is a lot of me in you. I see it.

27:28.323 --> 27:33.698
Please! Do you know that every night
before I went to sleep...

27:33.871 --> 27:38.533
...I used to pray that you would take
your lithium and just act normal?

27:38.710 --> 27:41.379
- Do you think it was easy for me?
- But it was exciting.

27:41.546 --> 27:45.924
We never knew what to expect. Would
you bring home a loser you met in a bar?

27:46.093 --> 27:49.213
Or maybe you'd run down our street
naked screaming your head off.

27:49.388 --> 27:53.089
- You can hate me. It's okay to hate me.
- Then there was that Thanksgiving...

27:53.267 --> 27:55.675
...when I was 10.
You remember that one?

27:55.853 --> 27:58.855
- Here we go. Here we go.
- You were cooking mashed potatoes.

27:59.024 --> 28:02.690
- Here we go, here we go. Okay.
- I walked in. You asked where I'd been.

28:02.862 --> 28:05.780
I said I'd been to visit Dad.
I'll never forget your face.

28:05.948 --> 28:08.783
You threw the food on the floor.
You chased me with a knife!

28:08.951 --> 28:10.233
I'd never hurt you, Abby.

28:10.412 --> 28:12.985
- I'd never hurt you.
- I locked myself in the closet!

28:13.165 --> 28:15.835
- I remember sitting with my feet...
- It was the disease.

28:16.002 --> 28:18.623
- ... against the door to keep you out.
- It was the disease.

28:18.796 --> 28:20.705
You have to see me.
I'm not just a disease!

28:20.882 --> 28:24.049
That night you made me sleep
beside you to prove you were sorry.

28:24.219 --> 28:26.888
- I couldn't sleep. I had to watch you.
- I'm your mother.

28:27.055 --> 28:31.136
- You might flip out again. I was 10!
- I'm the only mother you'll ever have.

28:31.936 --> 28:35.388
- I didn't choose to be sick.
- You never tried to get better!

28:39.486 --> 28:42.192
- I can't make things different.
- That's right!

28:42.365 --> 28:45.816
You can't! So now just go home.

29:19.072 --> 29:21.825
I couldn't talk.
Words just wouldn't come out.

29:21.993 --> 29:26.489
Have you had any other symptoms?
Change in vision? Headaches?

29:26.664 --> 29:31.742
Nothing significant. Neck's a little sore
from hockey. Headache, on and off.

29:31.920 --> 29:36.417
Could be an atypical migraine, maybe
cerebritis. You under a lot of stress?

29:36.592 --> 29:40.673
- Who isn't?
- Right. Let's take a look.

29:50.816 --> 29:53.273
- You ready?
- Yeah, I guess.

30:12.800 --> 30:16.216
This is ridiculous.
I'm actually feeling much better.

30:16.387 --> 30:19.554
It's probably hypoglycemia
from skipping breakfast and lunch.

30:19.724 --> 30:22.891
Well, when I was dizzy and vomited
I took a pregnancy test.

30:23.061 --> 30:25.600
I'm not pregnant.
I had a period last month.

30:27.233 --> 30:30.269
- That was breakthrough bleeding.
- What?

30:30.945 --> 30:33.104
- You're pregnant.
- Well, that's impossible.

30:33.740 --> 30:35.068
Really?

30:36.701 --> 30:39.620
Technically, it's possible.

30:41.332 --> 30:44.416
You know, maybe we should run
a serum test just to make sure.

30:44.752 --> 30:46.876
It's okay. Why don't you lie down?

30:47.047 --> 30:51.293
I'll do an ultrasound
and see how far along you are.

31:14.327 --> 31:16.284
What's the word?

31:17.413 --> 31:21.626
There appears to be a 3.5 centimeter
mass in the frontal cortex.

31:21.794 --> 31:23.585
A brain tumor.

31:24.547 --> 31:26.457
How bad is it?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.792
I want to discuss it
with a neurosurgeon.

31:28.968 --> 31:33.548
- You're a radiologist. How bad is it?
- I really can't say.

31:36.435 --> 31:38.678
What's my prognosis?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.481
Phil?

31:43.401 --> 31:46.937
You need to talk to a neurosurgeon
right away.

31:52.370 --> 31:56.582
It's not like he swallowed one nail.
We're talking pounds of hardware.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.591
There's nails and screws and...

31:59.895 --> 32:03.039
one of those metric socket sets, a plier.

32:03.216 --> 32:05.921
I mean,
I'm palpating this guy's belly.

32:06.094 --> 32:10.803
And there's a crescent wrench
outlined in bas-relief.

32:10.974 --> 32:13.347
I mean,
just smashed up against the skin.

32:13.519 --> 32:17.731
My husband says to me, "You've got
to go in there and consent this guy. "

32:17.899 --> 32:19.559
- You were married?
- Yes.

32:19.734 --> 32:22.439
He was a surgical Resident.
So I go in there and I say:

32:22.613 --> 32:25.400
"Mr. Jebson,
how did you get all this stuff down? "

32:25.574 --> 32:29.240
And he says, "A good Chablis. "

32:32.373 --> 32:34.449
He says, "A good Chablis. "
Oh, my gosh.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.378
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.

32:37.838 --> 32:40.755
- It's fine. No, you missed most of me.
- I can't believe-

32:40.924 --> 32:44.128
- I'll pay for the dry-cleaning. Sorry.
- Kerry, it's all right.

32:44.304 --> 32:48.087
- Did you bring the guacamole?
- Yeah, and onion dip.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.474
- Hey, Dr. Greene.
- Hey.

32:52.646 --> 32:54.105
Are you okay?

32:54.273 --> 32:56.432
- I was just heading out.
- Good night.

32:56.609 --> 32:59.396
We need dessert. I can grab
something from Doc Magoo's.

32:59.570 --> 33:00.981
- We don't need it that bad.
- Good night.

33:01.155 --> 33:03.232
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Have a good one.

33:03.784 --> 33:05.159
I'm starving.

33:05.827 --> 33:07.785
Those are my favorite, girl.

33:10.291 --> 33:11.951
Hey, what happened?

33:12.543 --> 33:14.620
- Your-?
- I went for a walk.

33:14.796 --> 33:17.252
- In the rain?
- How's Mr. Florea?

33:17.424 --> 33:20.875
He threw a clot.
I had to give him TPA.

33:21.137 --> 33:23.972
Oxygen levels are up,
vitals are stable.

33:24.140 --> 33:26.298
Can I give you a hand?
Help you with anything?

33:26.475 --> 33:28.386
- I'm just starting an IV.
- With your mom.

33:28.562 --> 33:32.310
No. Every time she goes off her meds
she says she's not gonna do it again.

33:32.482 --> 33:34.143
Why should this time be different?

33:34.318 --> 33:37.485
- I don't know.
- My patient's smoking again. Excuse me.

33:37.655 --> 33:41.736
Mr. Thal, I told you if you want
to smoke you have to go outside.

33:41.910 --> 33:45.990
In the rain? I've got pneumonia.

33:47.834 --> 33:51.914
- Man, this is smelling weird!
- I need an ashtray.

33:52.213 --> 33:56.508
- Anything else I can get you?
- An extra pillow would be nice.

33:57.469 --> 34:01.135
- Dr. Carter, could I speak with you?
- Sure.

34:01.307 --> 34:04.059
I know you're a friend
of my daughter's.

34:04.226 --> 34:07.846
This is awkward for me.
I don't know what else to do.

34:08.023 --> 34:12.850
- Could you talk to her for me?
- I'm not sure what-

34:15.281 --> 34:17.652
- Abby's in there!
- Stay here! Stay here!

34:17.824 --> 34:19.284
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:19.453 --> 34:22.121
- Oh, my God! Abby!
- Everyone, stay outside!

34:22.289 --> 34:24.696
- Abby!
- Stay out here!

34:24.875 --> 34:26.748
- Abby!
- Abby!

34:27.128 --> 34:30.045
- Abby!
- Abby! God, Abby!

34:30.214 --> 34:32.206
- Abby!
- Oh, my God, Abby!

34:32.382 --> 34:34.542
Please wait outside.

34:35.053 --> 34:36.512
- Abby?
- Is she all right?

34:36.679 --> 34:39.053
- Is your neck okay?
- Is she all right?

34:41.811 --> 34:44.431
- Is her airway clear?
- I think she's okay.

34:44.605 --> 34:47.975
Let's go! Let's go! Down the hall
to the right! Carter, you need help?

34:48.150 --> 34:50.060
I don't think so. Curtain 2.

34:50.235 --> 34:51.779
Get me an intubation kit...

34:51.947 --> 34:54.783
- ... lactated Ringer's and burn dressings.
- Look out, please!

34:56.243 --> 34:57.868
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.948
Is she all right?

35:01.166 --> 35:02.411
Is she badly hurt?

35:02.584 --> 35:04.078
- Can you wait outside?
- No.

35:04.252 --> 35:06.246
Stethoscope.
Do you have any chest pain?

35:06.422 --> 35:08.379
- Yeah.
- You do? Where's it hurt?

35:08.549 --> 35:10.209
- Right there.
- Right here?

35:10.384 --> 35:12.508
Okay, take a deep breath for me.

35:12.804 --> 35:14.844
All right, give me the oxygen.

35:43.797 --> 35:45.541
Hello, Mommy.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.420
Jing-Mei.

35:52.474 --> 35:54.632
I'm so glad you came.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.594
- Who's here?
- Everybody.

36:00.649 --> 36:02.274
Great.

36:02.568 --> 36:04.894
- I'll go get your father.
- You didn't tell Ba-Ba?

36:05.071 --> 36:06.945
You asked me not to.

36:07.615 --> 36:10.653
He'll be okay. Shocked, but okay.

36:11.996 --> 36:15.779
You underestimate us, Jing-Mei.
You've always underestimated us.

36:19.379 --> 36:24.587
Mommy, will you love the baby
if the father is black?

36:29.264 --> 36:31.258
He's black.

36:34.896 --> 36:36.936
That's what I thought.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.776
Jing-Mei?

36:40.694 --> 36:43.815
It's okay, Mommy.
That's why I didn't tell you.

36:49.788 --> 36:52.326
- Any idea what started it?
- Ether.

36:52.499 --> 36:53.780
Ether?

36:53.959 --> 36:57.210
A couple of guys in the pharmacy were
cooking crystal meth.

36:57.380 --> 37:01.842
Transported the ether in IV bags.
One of theirs got mixed in.

37:02.011 --> 37:04.003
- Damn!
- Everybody out?

37:04.179 --> 37:05.590
All but two patients.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.060
Well, move it. We're evacuating
this whole department.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.097
- They're critical.
- I'll give you 10 minutes.

37:14.942 --> 37:16.899
Just take a deep breath.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.186
- Chest still hurt?
- A little. Can I get up?

37:19.363 --> 37:21.902
- I'm okay. I could help.
- Not until I get a chest x-ray.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.862
- I don't need a chest x-ray.
- Abby, come on. Let him help you.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.578
- How are you?
- I'm a little sore.

37:26.746 --> 37:29.748
- I think she cracked a rib.
- How's Mr. Thal?

37:29.917 --> 37:32.205
He's going to the Burn Unit.
But he'll be okay.

37:32.377 --> 37:35.581
- How much Ringer's do you want?
- Ten liters over eight hours.

37:35.757 --> 37:39.457
- How's your guy with the PE?
- CT was normal. No brain bleeding.

37:40.803 --> 37:42.263
Good.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.263
Let's get you up to Radiology.

37:49.564 --> 37:55.021
He was staring up at me from the
pavement. And with every breath...

37:55.195 --> 37:58.564
...I could see frosted cloud...

37:58.991 --> 38:01.280
...from his mouth...

38:01.452 --> 38:03.445
...get smaller.

38:05.039 --> 38:09.998
I just talked to him,
tried to reassure him.

38:10.379 --> 38:14.128
And I held his hand until he died.

38:14.467 --> 38:19.093
- The ambulance never came?
- He was gone when they got there.

38:19.347 --> 38:21.554
Oh, my God...

38:22.309 --> 38:24.634
Well, what happened to the driver
who hit him?

38:24.811 --> 38:26.556
Not enough.

38:27.523 --> 38:30.477
He was drunk.
But this was 19 years ago.

38:31.152 --> 38:33.726
They revoked his license for a while...

38:33.905 --> 38:38.235
...and had him pick up trash
on Saturday or something.

38:42.248 --> 38:43.659
Well...

38:45.751 --> 38:49.916
I certainly got us off on
a very depressing tangent, didn't I?

38:51.132 --> 38:53.885
I think we're gonna close
this place down.

38:55.221 --> 38:57.213
I'm sorry.
We haven't taken care of this.

38:57.390 --> 39:00.344
- No, no, no. No, you paid last time.
- Let me. Come on.

39:00.519 --> 39:03.852
- You know what? Why don't we split it?
- I got it.

39:04.314 --> 39:05.595
Thank you.

39:07.985 --> 39:10.108
You know,
this is our second meal together.

39:10.279 --> 39:14.989
Some people might consider
a second dinner a date.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.654
A date?

39:18.539 --> 39:20.330
- You do know I'm gay?
- Of course.

39:20.499 --> 39:24.034
I don't have a problem with that.
I have gay friends.

39:27.966 --> 39:32.095
- I'm sorry, Kerry. I misread this.
- No. I mean, I didn't-

39:32.263 --> 39:35.180
I'm so sorry if
I gave you the wrong impression.

39:35.349 --> 39:38.719
It's just that you called me for eight
psych consults in the past week.

39:38.895 --> 39:40.852
We work well together.

39:41.564 --> 39:44.055
- My instincts are usually reliable.
- You know what?

39:44.234 --> 39:45.563
Thank you.

39:46.487 --> 39:51.909
You know, I'm really very flattered-
You're such a beautiful woman.

39:52.369 --> 39:57.874
You're so beautiful. But I'm straight.
I mean, I don't- I'm straight.

39:58.042 --> 40:00.118
- Okay.
- Oh, God...

40:00.294 --> 40:03.461
Oh, my God! I don't know-
I don't know what-

40:03.631 --> 40:07.961
I mean, I'm sorry.
I just, I don't- I feel very...

40:10.221 --> 40:12.298
You know what? I just...

40:16.145 --> 40:21.436
I mean, I guess I never even
really considered this.

40:24.613 --> 40:28.113
You haven't said a word
since we left the hospital.

40:29.285 --> 40:33.449
We can talk to each other.
That's what people do in relationships.

40:34.624 --> 40:35.904
All right.

40:36.293 --> 40:41.121
I'm pissed that Romano's docking my
pay for punching Malucci. That better?

40:41.298 --> 40:44.834
You should be furious.
Malucci was way out of line.

40:45.011 --> 40:47.051
Not that I'm surprised.

40:47.639 --> 40:49.846
What's that supposed to mean?

40:50.517 --> 40:53.933
You get docked
because Malucci's a jackass.

40:54.104 --> 40:57.806
Your nephew gets crappy care
because they assume he's a banger.

40:57.984 --> 40:59.858
Today our patient couldn't
get her meds.

41:00.028 --> 41:01.937
I'm tired of hearing you
go off on this.

41:02.113 --> 41:04.605
Stop trying to teach
everybody how to be black.

41:05.701 --> 41:07.943
And you need to face reality.

41:08.120 --> 41:11.821
Debby Marlin couldn't get pain
medication because her pharmacy...

41:12.000 --> 41:14.704
- ... was in a black neighborhood.
- You grew up in the suburbs.

41:14.877 --> 41:18.082
- What do you know about her?
- I can't relate because I wasn't poor?

41:18.257 --> 41:22.006
No. I'm just saying, I know who I am.
I don't have anything to prove.

41:22.178 --> 41:24.965
And I do because my mother's white?

41:25.139 --> 41:26.847
I didn't say that.

41:28.477 --> 41:30.304
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting off.

41:30.479 --> 41:32.970
- This isn't our stop.
- I don't want to see you now.

41:33.148 --> 41:35.818
Cleo, we're supposed to be
going to your cousin's-

41:42.409 --> 41:47.404
Good news. Your lungs look clear.
But you cracked a rib on the right.

41:47.581 --> 41:50.702
- I'll write your discharge orders.
- You don't have to do that.

41:50.877 --> 41:55.207
Fine. You did have a concussion,
loss of consciousness.

41:55.382 --> 41:58.217
- So I'm gonna call you later.
- Thank you.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.378
- "Doctor. "
- Doctor.

42:18.574 --> 42:20.734
- I borrowed an umbrella.
- Okay.

42:21.578 --> 42:24.413
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Carter.

42:59.997 --> 43:02.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:04.626 --> 43:07.544
That steak smells fantastic.

43:08.631 --> 43:10.789
How'd you get the charcoal going
in the rain?

43:10.967 --> 43:13.340
I just pulled the grill
in under the overhang.

43:13.512 --> 43:17.841
I've never had a deck to grill on before.
Makes me feel very American.

43:18.016 --> 43:20.306
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:20.811 --> 43:23.302
- Shall I help you with the salad?
- Sure.

43:23.481 --> 43:24.891
Okay.

43:33.117 --> 43:34.611
Mark...

43:35.786 --> 43:40.864
...I have something to tell you.
It's not going to be easy.

43:41.334 --> 43:42.829
Go ahead.

43:43.003 --> 43:45.921
Well, I know it's not exactly
the best time, but...

43:48.217 --> 43:51.135
What the hell? I'm pregnant.

43:52.931 --> 43:55.256
Chen did an ultrasound.

43:59.230 --> 44:01.187
What are you thinking?

44:06.363 --> 44:10.277
- I think it's wonderful.
- I love you.

44:13.871 --> 44:16.327
I love you too.
