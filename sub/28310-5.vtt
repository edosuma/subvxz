WEBVTT

00:05.391 --> 00:08.843
Oh, let's see what
the emergency is today.

00:08.981 --> 00:10.741
- You guys have been here before?
- Oh, yeah.

00:10.914 --> 00:13.748
Lucy, you are about to
experience Gravatti the Hottie.

00:13.795 --> 00:16.572
- She's a regular.
- Yeah, a regular pain in the ass.

00:18.174 --> 00:20.427
I need help in here!

00:25.032 --> 00:27.862
Afternoon, Mrs. Gravatti.
Dispatch says you fell.

00:28.191 --> 00:30.294
I did. Last week.

00:30.796 --> 00:33.902
Now I need somebody
to carry me to my bed.

00:34.426 --> 00:38.159
I'm looking at you, my
little Hawaiian lion.

00:38.562 --> 00:41.646
Oh, well, Mrs. Gravatti,

00:41.671 --> 00:44.016
you're actually gonna be
tended to by the rookie,

00:44.051 --> 00:45.524
Firefighter McConky, today.

00:45.644 --> 00:47.885
No nookie for the rookie.

00:47.985 --> 00:50.729
I want the Polynesian Wookiee.

00:50.809 --> 00:53.406
Uh, Cap, can you tell her
that it's Lucy's job now?

00:53.543 --> 00:55.408
Yeah, that would be
the fair thing to do,

00:55.433 --> 00:57.507
except it's a lot funnier if you do it.

00:57.685 --> 00:58.927
- Funnier?
- Yeah.

00:58.962 --> 01:00.557
- It's go time.
- Yeah.

01:01.247 --> 01:03.164
Come on, my little pu pu platter.

01:03.311 --> 01:06.189
You've had enough of that.

01:06.314 --> 01:07.962
Ohh.

01:08.558 --> 01:10.965
Mama's hungry for some poke.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.594
Oh, well, that much fish 
isn't good for you.

01:13.697 --> 01:15.058
Do you like it when I do it right there?

01:15.082 --> 01:17.526
No. When you do it, no. Oops. Oh...

01:17.589 --> 01:19.542
Tickles, doesn't it?

01:20.604 --> 01:21.994
- I know.
- Okay.

01:22.177 --> 01:24.621
Maybe the rookie should come, too,

01:24.646 --> 01:26.832
for some on-the-job training.

01:27.024 --> 01:28.198
Hard pass. Thanks.

01:28.233 --> 01:29.272
Whoo!

01:29.449 --> 01:31.954
Okay, Mrs. Gravatti. Sleep it off.

01:32.409 --> 01:33.798
Hey, let's give them
their privacy, shall we?

01:39.278 --> 01:40.603
Mahalo, little buddy!

01:42.043 --> 01:43.561
Guys, this is a fire hazard!

01:43.731 --> 01:45.560
Guys, don't leave without me!

01:45.767 --> 01:47.420
Guys! Guys!

01:47.562 --> 01:50.248
Aah! Unh. All right. Keep the shirt!

01:50.315 --> 01:52.918
A moment of silence for our
naked first responder.

01:53.361 --> 01:54.535
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:54.855 --> 01:56.654
- Lunchtime.
- Uh, rezie for

01:56.679 --> 01:57.909
four at Charlie's Steakers?

01:58.090 --> 01:59.710
- Make it three.
- Damn.

02:25.428 --> 02:26.980
Damn, Cap. That smells good.

02:27.079 --> 02:29.046
Thank you, Granny.
Eggs Penisi and sausage

02:29.121 --> 02:31.052
is the only way to start the day.

02:31.227 --> 02:33.332
- Yeah.
- Wow. Spin!

02:33.367 --> 02:34.572
- Ooh!
- Wow!

02:34.623 --> 02:36.963
You see how he's making
everything look super-difficult?

02:37.233 --> 02:38.313
- Yeah.
- That, my friends,

02:38.337 --> 02:39.399
is a sign of a good chef.

02:39.597 --> 02:41.986
- No, it's the opposite.
- Oh, great. Look at this.

02:42.065 --> 02:43.308
No more Himalayan sea salt.

02:43.342 --> 02:45.635
It's that Frenchie from the
B-shift. He uses it all up.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.357
Eh, B-shift guys.
"Uhh, I'm on B-shift."

02:48.492 --> 02:50.992
Oh, man. That O'Sullivan
guy freaks me out.

02:51.151 --> 02:52.984
You know, the really weird
thing about O'Sullivan,

02:53.008 --> 02:55.801
is those freaky Bible versus
that he has tattooed all over him.

02:55.906 --> 02:57.106
No, those aren't Bible versus.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.944
That's from "The Fault in Our Stars."

02:58.978 --> 03:00.566
Ah, man. He's gonna regret that.

03:00.601 --> 03:02.282
- What a dipshit.
- There we go.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.585
Another perfect sausage.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.608
- Ooh.
- Ohh!

03:05.767 --> 03:07.307
- Andy's!
- Andy's!

03:07.504 --> 03:09.132
No, no. Floor patties go to the rookie.

03:09.299 --> 03:10.300
- What?!
- Yeah.

03:10.326 --> 03:11.775
No, because that would be hazing,

03:11.819 --> 03:13.515
- and we don't do that anymore.
- Right.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.074
Stopped with you, 
actually, buddy.

03:15.098 --> 03:17.549
Guess what. I'm not
gonna eat that patty.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.136
- Sorry, Cap.
- What's the big deal?

03:19.171 --> 03:20.917
Any hair picked up off the
floor is probably yours.

03:23.106 --> 03:25.583
For the last time,
I'm not losing my hair.

03:25.641 --> 03:28.299
- I'm thinning, tops.
- Dude, the top of your head

03:28.324 --> 03:30.153
looks like the nipple on a gorilla tit.

03:30.199 --> 03:31.821
Hey!

03:31.942 --> 03:33.323
- Good morning.
- Hola!

03:33.358 --> 03:35.706
Hey. Mind your manners. The
lovely Vicki McConky is here.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.476
- There she is!
- Hey, Ma.

03:37.714 --> 03:39.295
- What's up, sis?
- What's this now?

03:39.329 --> 03:40.747
Is this trash, or is this Andy's?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.897
- How does this work?
- That's still under discush.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.454
- No, it's not. That's trash, Chief.
- It's Andy's.

03:45.485 --> 03:47.009
I also have something food-related.

03:47.422 --> 03:50.390
We are hosting the pancake
breakfast benefit for the hospital.

03:50.443 --> 03:52.707
And Vicki's running it, so
she's got something to say.

03:53.550 --> 03:54.661
- Go!
- All right.

03:54.827 --> 03:58.232
So, we are having the
breakfast on Sunday the 15th,

03:58.257 --> 03:59.811
and we need some of you

03:59.836 --> 04:02.224
- to supply the entertainment.
- Not it.

04:02.249 --> 04:03.249
- Not it.
- No.

04:03.274 --> 04:04.758
- Come on.
- Come on, you guys.

04:04.783 --> 04:06.256
Granny, can I count on you

04:06.281 --> 04:09.007
to serenade the good townsfolk
of Tacoma with that ukulele?

04:09.070 --> 04:11.431
I'm sorry, Vicki. It's just
not the right crowd for my uke.

04:11.534 --> 04:12.859
Uh, I'll tell you what, Vick.

04:12.883 --> 04:15.219
I may be able to shake my moneymaker

04:15.244 --> 04:17.571
in a family-friendly fashion
for this little shindig.

04:17.623 --> 04:21.041
Uh, is that even remotely possible?

04:21.456 --> 04:23.020
- No.
- Come on.

04:23.131 --> 04:25.501
My ass is up against a
wall here. I need some help.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.176
Who wants to be a hero?

04:27.391 --> 04:29.298
Oh, well, I've been
working on something.

04:29.419 --> 04:32.461
- Great.
- It incorporates fire-safety education

04:32.486 --> 04:34.534
with modern-day urban youth culture.

04:34.715 --> 04:36.036
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

04:36.061 --> 04:38.073
I love that. Let's hear it!

04:38.240 --> 04:39.964
Uh, I'd rather show you.

05:17.786 --> 05:19.627
Honey, do you have anything else?

05:19.846 --> 05:20.944
- No, I don't.
- Dude, dude,

05:20.969 --> 05:22.973
I'm gonna say this as your friend.

05:23.537 --> 05:24.798
Never do that again.

05:24.823 --> 05:27.117
Well, it's not for you, Granny,
okay? It's for the kids.

05:27.142 --> 05:30.524
You know, it's a educational,
endearing character. Flame-o.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.346
Uh, was Flame-o the absolute first name

05:33.371 --> 05:34.855
that came to your mind?

05:38.759 --> 05:39.973
I'd like to see you try!

05:39.998 --> 05:41.616
I'd like to see any of you guys try!

05:41.741 --> 05:42.909
Any of you guys!

05:44.520 --> 05:45.536
Uh...

05:48.734 --> 05:49.958
Someone open the door!

05:54.294 --> 05:55.414
You wanted to see me, Chief?

05:55.440 --> 05:56.600
Yeah, come on. Sit down.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.143
What's the matter? Why
you getting so emotional?

06:01.167 --> 06:03.203
I mean, it's just the razzing, Chief.

06:03.261 --> 06:05.943
I thought since I'm no longer
the rookie, that, you know,

06:05.968 --> 06:07.928
they'd stop dumping on me
and it'd be Lucy's turn.

06:07.997 --> 06:09.717
So you want them to
give my daughter shit?

06:09.825 --> 06:11.414
No, it's not that... No, I don't want...

06:11.438 --> 06:13.095
No, you guys aren't
listening to me. I...

06:13.105 --> 06:15.533
Okay. I'm just kidding. I'm
just giving you the business.

06:15.623 --> 06:16.732
That's what we do here.

06:16.799 --> 06:19.238
Captain Penisi gives me guff all
the time, and I saved his life.

06:19.262 --> 06:20.436
But we care about each other.

06:20.835 --> 06:22.226
They razz you 'cause they love you.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.138
I'm just tired of that kind of love.

06:24.513 --> 06:26.343
Hmm. Bothers you that much, huh?

06:26.409 --> 06:27.419
Yeah, it kind of does.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.215
You know what? I got
a solution. Come on.

06:30.362 --> 06:32.322
- I'm gonna go change first.
- No, no, no. Keep it.

06:32.346 --> 06:34.175
- I like it. Come on.
- Huh? You like it?

06:34.253 --> 06:35.508
- Yeah.
- Heh. I like it.

06:37.677 --> 06:39.989
If you're not from
China, then no "peeking"!

06:43.133 --> 06:45.146
- "No peeking."
- Hey, listen up, listen up!

06:45.260 --> 06:47.435
I got a scheduling issue.
One of the guys on the B team

06:47.773 --> 06:48.967
has to switch his hours.

06:49.001 --> 06:50.914
Oh, no. Is one of those
mutants coming over here?

06:50.938 --> 06:52.058
Just for a few weeks. But...

06:52.139 --> 06:53.818
But that means someone from
here has to go over there.

06:53.842 --> 06:54.857
- Not it.
- Not it.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.112
- Not me.
- I've already decided,

06:56.136 --> 06:57.186
- it's gonna be Andy.
- Oh...

06:57.210 --> 06:58.353
- What?
- Sucks for you, dude.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.090
- Oh, no.
- You're okay with this, right?

07:00.199 --> 07:02.479
- No. Chief, come on.
- It solves some problems.

07:02.774 --> 07:05.154
Go home, rest up, come back
at 8:00 a.m. for the B-shift.

07:05.973 --> 07:07.837
- Carry on.
- Have fun over there, Flame-o.

07:08.047 --> 07:09.538
They're gonna love your Superman suit.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.839
Say hi to Rudolph for us.

07:10.944 --> 07:12.704
Man, those B-shift guys
are gonna chew you up

07:12.729 --> 07:13.935
and eat you like a...

07:14.737 --> 07:16.581
Like a... Aw, man, like a sh...

07:16.615 --> 07:18.490
- You got it.
- You can do it.

07:18.714 --> 07:20.594
It's over now. He's not even here.

07:20.819 --> 07:22.030
Just do it anyway.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.300
Do it for us.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.611
- Like a shit sandwich.
- Okay.

07:26.386 --> 07:28.800
Once you add the olive oil, rub it down.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.536
I'm gonna cook the shit
out of these things.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.951
- Mmm, man!
- Then I'm gonna eat 'em

07:31.975 --> 07:34.202
and then I'm gonna sleep my ass off!

07:34.668 --> 07:35.980
Fuck you, rain!

07:49.611 --> 07:51.096
Captain!

07:59.324 --> 08:00.324
Hi, guys.

08:00.557 --> 08:01.911
The famous Andy Myawani.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.725
- Aloha!
- Ha ha! Hey!

08:06.750 --> 08:09.133
I am so excited I finally
get to work with you!

08:09.158 --> 08:12.851
Man, you're so tall!
And look at that hair.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.799
We got a regular Fabio rock star here!

08:15.824 --> 08:18.507
I wouldn't say it's Fabio,
'cause I don't speak Italian.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.551
Oh, that's a good one!

08:23.093 --> 08:24.967
Hey, listen. I live by this.

08:25.112 --> 08:28.517
"There is no shortage of fault
to be found amid our stars."

08:29.050 --> 08:30.590
That's beautiful, man. Thank you.

08:30.629 --> 08:32.251
Boys, welcome Andy. Welcome.

08:32.484 --> 08:34.087
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.674
Hey, thank you. Welcome, Andy.

08:35.817 --> 08:37.203
- Come on!
- We're so glad you're here.

08:37.227 --> 08:38.678
- Welcome!
- You're the best, man!

08:38.919 --> 08:40.094
You're so awesome!

08:45.428 --> 08:48.293
- What is that smell?
- Ohh. Cocoa butter.

08:48.327 --> 08:49.812
Not that. That.

08:49.846 --> 08:51.572
It's breakfast. You guys should try it.

08:51.607 --> 08:53.715
Frenchie's a culinary genius.

08:54.411 --> 08:56.477
Oh, thank you, Grandy man.

08:57.613 --> 09:00.650
Saving lives is my job,
but delighting palates...

09:00.985 --> 09:02.858
ooh, that's my passion.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.103
- Ooh!
- Lucy.

09:05.137 --> 09:06.796
- All right?
- Thank you.

09:06.821 --> 09:08.244
You're welcome. Dick tap.

09:08.278 --> 09:11.069
- Oh.
- No, you didn't!

09:11.094 --> 09:12.637
I definitely did.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.155
What?! Chief, you never
told us this guy could cook.

09:16.242 --> 09:17.250
Look at this!

09:17.275 --> 09:19.355
Supervising multiple shifts
is a delicate dance, Ike.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.304
Plus, I gotta protect
the ego of your captain.

09:21.329 --> 09:23.828
Yeah, well, don't worry a hair on
that pretty little stomach of yours.

09:23.852 --> 09:25.963
Chef Penisi welcomes the competish.

09:26.331 --> 09:27.919
Oh, good. Here you go, Cap.

09:27.953 --> 09:28.955
Thank you.

09:29.472 --> 09:30.529
- Enjoy.
- I will.

09:30.768 --> 09:32.770
Come on! Frenchie, this is awesome!

09:33.092 --> 09:35.316
Look at the presentation. That
little drippy stuff over here.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.016
- You're the master.
- Damn right, I am.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.681
It's good, right?

09:43.486 --> 09:44.921
I've had better.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.496
I didn't even have to
put lots of salt on my egg.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.380
I didn't put any salt on
these at all. It's perfect.

09:49.404 --> 09:50.421
- Right.
- They're perfect!

09:50.445 --> 09:52.151
This is the best omelet I've ever had.

09:52.253 --> 09:53.669
You should give Captain some tips.

09:53.703 --> 09:55.153
Anybody care for some créme brûlée?

09:55.187 --> 09:57.017
- For breakfast?!
- Way!

09:57.051 --> 09:58.762
- Yeah. Why not?
- Yeah, I want one.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.278
I take mine crunchy.

10:00.365 --> 10:02.170
- You're the nicest guy ever.
- Aw, don't sweat it.

10:02.194 --> 10:04.194
I love doing this stuff,
and I'm really good at it.

a ship's wheel on his dick.

10:10.617 --> 10:11.736

"You know you have a
ship's wheel on his dick?"

10:14.206 --> 10:16.788
The pirate says, "Arrrgh,
it drives me nuts."

10:19.738 --> 10:21.093

gets the nuisance calls.

10:50.311 --> 10:52.651

11:05.810 --> 11:07.563
Yeah, we barely even cross paths.

Our work schedules are
completely different.

got on your shoulders

You're on a roller coaster
that only goes up, my friend!

11:32.629 --> 11:34.770
- I can't reach it.
- Aw, nuts.

11:34.804 --> 11:37.858
But I think if I turn around
and face the other way...

It's just like... Aah!

12:00.992 --> 12:02.357
Why is he pretending to have fun?

12:02.397 --> 12:04.238
It's like an inside joke that
we had, and he's doing this

12:04.262 --> 12:05.777
to bug me like he
thinks it's gonna bug me.

12:05.801 --> 12:07.848

mad that he's having fun."

Do whatever you want.

You know what I mean?

12:11.936 --> 12:13.083

12:13.117 --> 12:16.120

How come Frenchie isn't helping us?

12:21.116 --> 12:22.356
Yeah, where's he at?

12:22.403 --> 12:24.071
Oh, he's out there rooting for truffles.

12:24.302 --> 12:26.971
Everyone knows there's no
truffles in Washington, idiot.

12:27.226 --> 12:29.155
Shouldn't he be, like,
you know, doing his job?

12:29.203 --> 12:31.115
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of glad he's not in here.

12:31.274 --> 12:33.552
- Doesn't shower much.
- Is that what that smell is?

12:33.679 --> 12:35.544
Dude smells like the
tropical zone at the zoo.

12:35.727 --> 12:37.314
- I always assumed it was Lucy.
- What?!

12:37.710 --> 12:39.362
Why would you think it's me?

12:39.386 --> 12:41.422
Because you're new, so
whenever I smell a new odor,

12:41.457 --> 12:42.657
I always just assume it's you.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.423
Stop doing that. That's disturbing.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.614
Okay.

12:45.658 --> 12:47.590
Found a shit-ton of truffles out there.

12:47.717 --> 12:49.441
Of course you did. There's
truffles everywhere in Washington.

12:49.465 --> 12:50.743
- What's up, guys?
- What's up?

12:50.768 --> 12:51.911
- Dick tap!
- Ohh!

12:53.703 --> 12:55.325
- Yes!
- "Ha ha!"

13:05.653 --> 13:07.479
Can we please make him stop?

13:07.716 --> 13:09.931
I have ear plugs in,
and I can still hear him.

13:26.491 --> 13:28.011
You know, Andy never snored like that.

13:28.048 --> 13:30.291
He always had that cute,
little koala-bear snore.

13:30.437 --> 13:32.542
It was just all... Mmm-mmm!

13:32.577 --> 13:34.862
Sure, he grinded his teeth. So what?

13:35.157 --> 13:36.918
Who cares if he's
toothless when he's older?

13:37.099 --> 13:39.005
- "Hey, I hate Granny."
- "Hey, Granny."

13:40.354 --> 13:41.834
All right. I can't take this anymore.

13:42.749 --> 13:44.243
Hey!

13:44.268 --> 13:46.073
Aw, man. I just woke up.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.819
- Oh, you're up?
- What's up, guys?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.287
Are you good? We're just making
sure you got blankets and...

13:50.311 --> 13:51.864
- Oh, yeah, dude.
- Stretching.

13:51.907 --> 13:53.476
- All set.
- All right.

13:53.805 --> 13:56.177
I do got to go make the
bladder gladder, though.

13:56.394 --> 13:57.918
- Ohh.
- Whoops.

13:57.943 --> 13:59.052
- Ohh.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.209

14:02.918 --> 14:05.536
- Rrrr!
- Whoo!

14:05.623 --> 14:06.983
Hey, Frenchie. You know what, man?

14:07.067 --> 14:09.377
I think the dick tap's kind
of reached its saturation point,

14:09.401 --> 14:11.170
- you know, so...
- Yeah, right!

14:13.385 --> 14:15.662
This guy officially sucks.

14:18.187 --> 14:20.880
Say, Billy, how do you 
get down from a ladder?

14:20.970 --> 14:22.890
You don't get down from a ladder.

14:23.199 --> 14:24.652
You get down from a goose!

14:24.732 --> 14:25.914

14:26.113 --> 14:28.162
I applaud the originality, fellas.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.840
I'm just concerned it's too cerebral.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.621
What are you guys up to?

14:32.629 --> 14:34.630
We're trying to come up with
an act for the pancake breakfast,

14:34.654 --> 14:36.446

like "flame" but more fun!

15:07.283 --> 15:09.388

15:24.837 --> 15:27.113
A little cheese quiche
with whole-grain crust.

15:27.241 --> 15:28.760
Delicious!

15:28.921 --> 15:31.053
Pretty heavy-handed pour
with that Himalayan sea salt.

I guess that's why you
go through it so fast.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.135
With all due respect, Captain,

15:35.401 --> 15:38.712
nobody's exactly begging you
to take back the cooking duties.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.083
Oh, really? We'll see about that.

15:40.177 --> 15:42.006
Hey, guys. Whose cooking
do you like better?

15:42.064 --> 15:44.031
- Frenchie's.
- Their opinion means nothing.

15:44.154 --> 15:46.006
They're probably all delirious 
from salt poisoning.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.389
You got something to say to me, Captain?

15:47.413 --> 15:49.406
Yeah. Stop tappin' everybody's dicks.

15:49.572 --> 15:50.932
I'm not tappin' everybody's dicks.

15:50.957 --> 15:52.537
I'm just tappin' my friends' dicks.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.943
So I guess you won't be
tappin' my dick any time soon.

15:55.009 --> 15:57.463
I would never dream of
tappin' your dick, sir.

15:57.488 --> 15:59.408
Good. 'Cause I don't like
getting my dick tapped.

15:59.439 --> 16:00.712
I wouldn't know how to tap it,

16:00.761 --> 16:02.291
because I wouldn't know how to find it.

16:02.315 --> 16:04.597
You should ask your mother.
She knows exactly where it is.

18:02.658 --> 18:03.799
You need a little dusting.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.547
'Cause if you don't have
it, you're not gonna get

18:05.571 --> 18:07.514
that sweetness that it really requires.

18:07.576 --> 18:08.862
Oh yeah, hey. Good luck, Cap.

18:08.939 --> 18:11.862
Thanks. I don't need it, though.
I got talent and connections.

18:11.887 --> 18:13.133
I mean, look at the judge's table.

18:13.157 --> 18:16.227
We got my sister, my
best friend/brother-in-law

18:16.252 --> 18:17.680
who I set up with my sister...

18:17.756 --> 18:19.404
- As a joke.
- Yeah, but it still worked.

18:19.429 --> 18:21.080
And you're here because of
it, all right? Pipe down.

18:21.104 --> 18:23.075
And we got Linda Price,
who definitely wants

18:23.100 --> 18:24.504
to climb Mount St. Eddie.

18:24.623 --> 18:26.235
- What makes you think that?
- Have you never seen the way

18:26.259 --> 18:27.616
she flips her hair whenever I'm around?

18:27.640 --> 18:29.157
- Nope.
- Well, if you do, let me know.

18:29.181 --> 18:30.879
- 'Cause then I'll know it's game on.
- Hey-oh!

18:32.585 --> 18:33.593
Hey, guys.

18:33.671 --> 18:34.672
- Oh.
- Hey, Andy.

18:34.728 --> 18:35.895
What's up, Andy?

18:37.672 --> 18:38.886
What's up, Andy?

18:40.847 --> 18:41.974
Uh... Nope, that's it.

18:41.999 --> 18:44.958
Just uh, wanted to say hi
and, uh, good luck, Cap.

18:45.127 --> 18:46.128
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.459
- Appreciate it.
- Cool, cool, cool.

18:47.483 --> 18:49.036
- Cool, cool, cool.
- Yeah, cool, cool.

18:49.142 --> 18:50.474
- Cool, cool.
- Cool, cool.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.189
- Yeah, cool.
- Thanks for stopping by.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.665
Yeah, cool.

18:54.896 --> 18:58.356
Okay, there we go. A
Burmese slow leopard.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.488
That's a fantastic paint job, Blocky.

19:00.523 --> 19:01.769
Thanks, O'Sullivan.

19:01.869 --> 19:03.836
Maybe you can use some of those paints

19:03.871 --> 19:06.177
to cover up your bald spot.

19:06.409 --> 19:08.655
Wow. That came out of nowhere.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.473
That's not really our style, Andy.

19:10.512 --> 19:11.814
No, no. I'm just razzing.

19:11.839 --> 19:14.671
I mean, I can make that joke
because I'm thinning, you know?

19:14.834 --> 19:16.833
Like, ha! Look at
this gorilla tit, guys.

19:16.858 --> 19:18.343
Ha ha!

19:18.762 --> 19:21.111
I see nothing but luxurious hair.

19:21.283 --> 19:23.191
What? No, no, no. You don't see scalp?

19:23.310 --> 19:24.590
There's scalp.

19:25.712 --> 19:28.841
"The marks humans leave
are too often scars."

19:29.105 --> 19:31.786
- Amen.
- Uh, thanks, O'Sullivan.

19:31.972 --> 19:33.738
Hey, buds. I guess all I got

19:33.763 --> 19:36.447
is a chocolate crepe
with a hazelnut ice cream.

19:36.492 --> 19:39.992
Slivered almonds in a semi-sweet
chocolate paste on top.

19:40.089 --> 19:41.919
Thank you, man. You're the best!

19:41.961 --> 19:43.618
You're damn right I am.

19:43.669 --> 19:46.068
- Dick tap.
- Ohh!

19:46.960 --> 19:48.134
That's so fun! We keep...

19:48.546 --> 19:49.964
- We keep doin' that.
- Right?

19:50.115 --> 19:51.528
- It never gets old.
- No, it doesn't.

19:51.552 --> 19:52.853
That's why I do it.

19:52.911 --> 19:55.027
Hello. Hello, Tacomaners!

19:55.205 --> 19:56.940
After much deliber-eating...

19:58.903 --> 20:00.815
we have come to a unanimous decision.

20:00.896 --> 20:03.611
We have a winner of the
pancake-cooking contest.

20:03.866 --> 20:05.239
Will the contestants please rise?

20:05.277 --> 20:06.360
Oh. You're already up.

20:06.395 --> 20:08.649
Okay, now, one of these
guys is the winner.

20:08.757 --> 20:10.746
Well, they're both winners,
'cause there are no losers here.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.047
There are only winners.

20:12.105 --> 20:13.505
I think when I announce the winner,

20:13.561 --> 20:15.782
they will both be happy for each other.

20:15.988 --> 20:17.714
And when I do announce
the winner, it'll be...

20:17.738 --> 20:19.311
Hey, Terry. Come on. Here we go.

20:19.336 --> 20:20.343
Great. Okay.

20:20.404 --> 20:21.678
Uh, the winner is...

20:21.809 --> 20:23.076
Frenchie Willikers!

20:23.191 --> 20:24.999
- Whoo!
- What?!

20:25.160 --> 20:28.301
Sacrebleu! That's gotta hurt, bud!

20:28.494 --> 20:31.692
- Ha-ha! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- No. No.

20:31.717 --> 20:33.215
No, no, no. That's bullshit.

20:33.263 --> 20:34.849
All right. Eddie,
this is a family event.

20:34.873 --> 20:36.519
- You didn't vote for me?
- You're not that good.

20:36.543 --> 20:37.675
He's a better cook than you are.

20:37.699 --> 20:40.702
And you? My own sister.
You didn't love my pancakes?

20:40.727 --> 20:42.315
I liked your pancakes.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.515
In an instant-mix, chain-hotel,

20:44.608 --> 20:46.816
"breakfast buffet on
a Tuesday" kind of way.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.625
But you. Ahh. Ahh. Ahh.

20:49.656 --> 20:52.714
And the crepes? Come here!

20:53.349 --> 20:54.968
- Mwah! Mwah!
- Thank you.

20:55.051 --> 20:56.851
Come over to our house whenever.

20:56.952 --> 20:59.023
- Aw. Thank you, Vicki.
- Okay. Okay.

20:59.169 --> 21:00.887
I see. I see. And you?

21:01.131 --> 21:02.827
You and I are never hooking up.

21:03.308 --> 21:04.756
I'm sorry. Who are you again?

21:05.107 --> 21:07.513
- I'm Eddie Penisi.
- All right.

21:07.538 --> 21:09.539
Ladies and gentlemen,
we filled your bellies.

21:09.564 --> 21:11.303
Now let's fill your ears.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.262
Everyone, stop, drop, and roll
for the stylings of Flame-O!

21:16.969 --> 21:21.560
Who's ready to feel the b-u-u-u-urn?!

21:21.675 --> 21:24.885
Bur-bur-bur-bur-bur,
bur-bur-bur-burn!

21:24.935 --> 21:26.445
No, Andy. Don't do it.

23:04.241 --> 23:06.091
Ah, man. I miss your creatine farts.

23:06.275 --> 23:07.345

23:07.475 --> 23:08.888
We only gave you shit
'cause we love you.

23:08.912 --> 23:11.224
I know that now. I love you guys, too.

23:11.322 --> 23:13.137
Hey, man. Forget this jazz.

23:13.852 --> 23:14.899
You wanna get out of here?

23:15.197 --> 23:17.485
- Yeah.
- The only way we know how.

23:40.077 --> 23:42.906
Welcome home, Andy. The
Gravatti honors are yours.

23:43.152 --> 23:45.051
I discovered some things on the B-shift.

23:45.501 --> 23:48.247
Sometimes Gravatti duty
isn't as bad as it seems.

23:48.431 --> 23:50.501
- What does that mean?
- It means...

23:50.679 --> 23:51.699
that I got this.

23:51.986 --> 23:53.009
Take five.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.133
Door's open!

24:04.661 --> 24:08.309
Hello? Uh... where are you?

24:10.867 --> 24:13.562
- Ohh.
- The Hawaiian lion.

24:13.679 --> 24:16.302
- Hi?
- You first-responded to my wife.

24:16.479 --> 24:17.479
She fell.

24:17.504 --> 24:19.202
You first-responded to my daughter.

24:19.393 --> 24:21.528
How's your smoke detector working?

24:21.671 --> 24:23.369
Let's see how you respond to this.

24:23.396 --> 24:24.396
No.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.058
I love having Andy back.
All is right in the world.
