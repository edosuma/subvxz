WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:07.424
[Cyril] Now, that doesn't look right.

00:07.507 --> 00:10.677
Why am I looking at a black hole?
You know I hate those.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.721
Yeah, we're nowhere near
where we're supposed to be.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.849
Well, maybe we should find the navigator
and throw something at him.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.684
Wait, I'm the-- Hey!

00:17.767 --> 00:18.768
Seriously?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.186
Sorry, I didn't have anything heavier.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.605
Also, there's that.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.361
That is the most evil thing
I've ever seen.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.156
This isn't my fault.
I didn't enter these coordinates.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.868
That thing summoned us out of hyperspace.

00:36.327 --> 00:40.290
Well, don't just stand there
gawping like stunned space elk.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.250
Go see
if there's anything worth salvaging.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.085
You want us to walk into a thing

00:44.169 --> 00:47.046
that might as well have
"imminent death" written on the side?

00:47.130 --> 00:48.173
Well...

00:49.174 --> 00:50.467
Since we're here.

00:52.552 --> 00:56.222
Yep, and nothing terrible
ever happens in a place like this.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.099
-[beeping]
-Hmm, I'm not finding much.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.810
Just a bunch of hallways
that meet up over there.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.187
-[beeping rapidly]
-Ooh, I'm picking up

01:02.270 --> 01:04.189
large amounts of organic compounds!

01:04.272 --> 01:07.650
Aw, but no moisture,
which only makes sense if it's--

01:07.734 --> 01:10.195
A giant field of old, dead aliens?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.322
Or an army of space mummies.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.282
Uh, look up circuit-dick.

01:14.365 --> 01:20.330
Oh, well, technically I'm correct
if they stand up... now!

01:20.914 --> 01:21.915
Right now.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.792
Instead of trying to raise the dead,

01:23.875 --> 01:26.503
why don't we just find something shiny
and get the heck out of here?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.838
Cyril, find anything?

01:28.922 --> 01:32.091
[sighs] Well, it looks like
there are two kinds of aliens.

01:32.175 --> 01:36.554
Heavily armored
and seems like they've been here for eons.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.264
[coughing] Ah!

01:38.348 --> 01:41.810
Dead... [coughs] ...alien...
[coughs] ...in... [coughs]

01:41.893 --> 01:44.020
my... [coughs] ...lungs.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.064
Whoa-ho! Cool!

01:49.943 --> 01:52.112
[Malory on radio] <i>We've decoded</i>
<i>the writing on the outside</i>

01:52.195 --> 01:54.280
<i>and it seemed... relevant.</i>

01:54.364 --> 01:55.448
Relevant how?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.033
[Malory] <i>Well, as far as we can tell,</i>

01:57.117 --> 02:01.621
<i>it's one phrase translated</i>
<i>into a dozen ancient languages.</i>

02:01.704 --> 02:05.792
<i>"Beware. End of life."</i>
<i>"Beware. End of life."</i>

02:05.875 --> 02:06.918
<i>Any-hoo...</i>

02:07.001 --> 02:08.878
Now I kind of wish we'd worn helmets.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.588
Time to go. Cyril, Pam.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.881
[coughing]

02:11.965 --> 02:16.386
Ha-ha! Bring me the biggest goose
in all of London!

02:16.469 --> 02:18.471
[mechanical whirring]

02:19.931 --> 02:21.307
Well, hello.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.645
I'm Mr. Deadly, and I'm coming with you.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.480
And if we don't take you?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.195
Written right on the side.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.657
[theme song playing]

03:18.781 --> 03:20.700
Could you say that one more time?

03:20.783 --> 03:21.784
Bring me the biggest goo--

03:21.868 --> 03:22.869
Not you!

03:22.952 --> 03:24.787
I'm a sentient doomsday device

03:24.871 --> 03:27.957
created by an extinct alien race
but never used.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.085
Wait, never used?
What about all those bodies?

03:31.169 --> 03:33.171
[lasers zapping]

03:36.674 --> 03:38.301
[roaring]

03:39.385 --> 03:40.720
[groaning]

03:40.803 --> 03:43.139
Well, hello. I'm Mr. Deadly.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.226
[sighs] Typical.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.978
I didn't kill them.
They died fighting over me.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.647
But you gestured threateningly.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.774
I've been alone for thousands of years,

03:52.857 --> 03:56.694
so my nonverbal communication skills
are a bit rusty.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.780
So wait, are you a weapon or not?

03:58.863 --> 04:00.657
As I said, doomsday device.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.950
Designed by a race to whom

04:02.033 --> 04:05.078
mutual destruction
was preferable to defeat.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.664
I was hidden away on the edge of space,

04:07.747 --> 04:13.336
but the war I was created to end
in fiery apotheosis concluded without me.

04:13.419 --> 04:20.176
So, there I remained, my only companions:
the velvety dark and solitude itself.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.595
And then?

04:22.679 --> 04:27.183
I got bored, so I nabbed you lot
out of hyperspace to help me explode,

04:27.267 --> 04:30.895
at which point
I'll atomize a few dozen solar systems.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.855
[chuckles]
Who else is turned on right now?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.107
-[Krieger] Always on.
-[others] Not at all.

04:34.190 --> 04:38.903
Am I to understand
that we brought a giant bomb onto the ship

04:38.987 --> 04:42.031
because you misunderstood its gestures?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.951
Yeah, keep working on it, buddy.

04:45.034 --> 04:50.081
Now, with that out of the way,
would you say, "Please detonate"?

04:51.541 --> 04:52.792
-Plea--
-[thuds]

04:54.919 --> 04:57.171
Keep little Miss Death Wish confined here

04:57.255 --> 05:00.300
until we decide what to do
with that walking apocalypse.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.469
So, we're just supposed to sit here
and twiddle our thumbs?

05:03.553 --> 05:07.348
I'm sure what you do with your thumbs
is entirely your business.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.267
[sighs]

05:09.350 --> 05:11.811
Yeah, just seethe silently.
That'll show her.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.146
Well, you're stuck here, too.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.272
I'm always stuck here.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.898
[giggling]

05:15.982 --> 05:16.983
What?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.236
I'm just laughing
at how little they respect you.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.780
[sighs] God, I need a drink.

05:23.114 --> 05:27.035
It looks like The Artifact
sealed itself up after you left.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.286
So, we're stuck with you, huh?

05:28.369 --> 05:30.955
Yes. Though I can't trigger myself,

05:31.039 --> 05:34.125
I would like to explode
at the earliest opportunity.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.880
Go right ahead.
If killed, I blow up automatically.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.840
Sort of obvious, when you think about it.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.886
So you lived your entire life
on that thing, right?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.971
You've never experienced anything?

05:47.055 --> 05:50.058
I could access
all the information in the galaxy.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.728
But I suppose you're right.
I didn't directly experience any of it.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.189
Aw, you must be horny as shit.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.900
The sole aim of my being is to explode.

05:58.983 --> 05:59.984
Been there, buddy. [chuckles]

06:00.068 --> 06:01.944
We get it. You wanna explode.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.655
But if you experience some stuff
and then explode,

06:04.739 --> 06:06.032
you'd get the best of both worlds.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.409
Maybe you won't want to explode at all.

06:08.493 --> 06:14.791
Unlikely, but intriguing. It is settled.
I shall experience... some stuff!

06:14.874 --> 06:17.543
Excellent. Laki Station is nearby.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.506
It's a cargo depot,
but it has its share of diversions.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.716
I'm just glad I won't have to look
at that thing anymore.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.760
What is it with you and black holes?

06:25.843 --> 06:27.345
Ever heard of spaghettification?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.138
Oh, yeah, I did that once.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.433
Man, we went everywhere,
nothing but sauce and starch.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.103
Nom-nom-nom-nom. [laughs]
I put on 20 pounds.

06:35.186 --> 06:39.107
Pam, not spaghetti vacation.
I'm talking about the scientific term

06:39.190 --> 06:41.275
for being sucked through
a black hole's event horizon

06:41.359 --> 06:43.778
and being stretched
into a thin strip of matter,

06:43.861 --> 06:46.614
screaming for eternity
because of time dilation.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.491
Spaghettification!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.786
We called ours "Pastafari." [chuckles]

06:55.123 --> 06:57.708
-[beeping]
-[humming]

06:57.792 --> 06:58.793
Ah!

06:59.210 --> 07:00.628
What are you doing in my inner sanct--

07:00.711 --> 07:03.881
room where I sit quietly
and do nothing suspicious?

07:03.965 --> 07:06.467
You come here to dream of electric sheep?

07:06.551 --> 07:10.555
Don't be a dick. Androids can't dream.
But we do think real hard about them.

07:10.638 --> 07:14.976
And make illegal experimental weapons
using our ship's supplies?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.310
What? No, that's not--

07:16.394 --> 07:19.730
Laki Station is notorious
for black market deals.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.774
I may just have a plan--

07:21.858 --> 07:24.569
-Stop that!
-Oh, sorry. I was just...

07:24.652 --> 07:28.197
Electric sheep. Like, do they plug in?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.740
[Mr. Deadly] My word.

07:29.824 --> 07:34.078
I knew the life cycle of a cow,
the atomic structure of sucrose,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.830
but the experience!

07:35.913 --> 07:37.915
Yeah, well, ice cream is good.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.792
-[moaning]
-Not that good.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.794
Unless you've got one
that's foreplay flavored.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.879
Do they have that?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.006
No. And let's keep it simple for now.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.383
I hear they have a greenhouse
that might be fun to walk through.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.427
Good grief, there's more than this?

07:49.510 --> 07:50.928
Yay, plants.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.223
So, what's the plan here?
Stuff him in a cargo hold and bug out?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.726
No, then he just blows up
a bunch of other people.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.060
We can make this work.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.563
If we just find something
he likes enough to live for.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.940
Oh, my God,
you always have to fix people, don't you?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.775
This is why our marriage didn't work.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.778
Really? It wasn't the fact that you slept
with everything on two legs?

08:08.529 --> 08:10.114
Hmm... Not always two.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.244
[Krieger] This is a disaster.
There's only two people here.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.996
Didn't you pass out the brochures?

08:17.079 --> 08:18.080
I did not.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.790
But the mix tape
doesn't make any sense without--

08:19.874 --> 08:22.126
[gasps] Oh, my God.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.753
You didn't send the mix tape?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.546
[Krieger and Pam]
♪<i> Sometimes you want to have fun </i>♪

<i>Blap-blap </i>♪

08:29.884 --> 08:35.056
The arms game is about connections,
not your quasi-musical cry for help.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.642
This is all window dressing anyway.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.269
This is bush league right here.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.521
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.732
Hey, after this, let's hit the dead drop
and then, space taco.

08:44.815 --> 08:45.983
Mm, def.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.902
Oh, my God! Are you guys spies?

08:47.985 --> 08:49.320
Oh, my God, yell it out, hello.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.156
Got it. Do you guys have, like,
an internship or something?

08:52.240 --> 08:53.908
I'm very sneaky.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.452
-Mm-hmm.
-I see you two have an eye.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.870
Let me show you the latest.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.414
Only for my special customers,
you understand.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.167
Yeah, well, we are pretty special.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.753
The Plasmoblast Chaos Edition!

09:05.836 --> 09:10.007
Hold down the trigger, and it fires
at wildly unpredictable intervals.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.301
-Why?
-Revenge Body Armor.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.179
When hit,
it auto-injects you with painkillers

09:15.263 --> 09:17.056
and rage-inducing pharmaceuticals.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.307
Why?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.644
And finally, my magnum opus.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.815
The personalized, identity-locked
temporary singularity grenade.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.941
That all sounds...

09:27.024 --> 09:28.234
-So dumb.
-Thank you.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.571
What's dumb about a temporary black hole
that sucks everything into it,

09:31.654 --> 09:34.490
then teleports itself
to a random location in the galaxy?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.034
All of the words that you said
in the order that you said them.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.579
-And we're out.
-If I may step in...

09:39.662 --> 09:41.372
These are only the appetizers.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.667
I do in fact have access
to a weapon of great power.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.669
-What, a fart cannon?
-Actually, I have one--

09:46.752 --> 09:50.798
No, something else. A doomsday device.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.091
The butterfly.

09:52.174 --> 09:57.930
A remarkable illustration of the capacity
of living things to change.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.641
Cool. Hey, is that something
you think you might be able to--

10:00.725 --> 10:01.892
What's going on, bud?

10:01.976 --> 10:05.730
Oh, I'm conversing with the butterfly
via pheromones.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.065
I just asked it to say, "Please detonate."

10:08.149 --> 10:09.859
I thought
you weren't gonna try to explode.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.779
That's not... anything I said.
Anyway, it was a hard pass.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.657
Much more foul-mouthed than I expected.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.576
Same to you, you bastard.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.995
Well, I guess we're safe.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.748
Until he finds a fruit fly
with a death wish.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.168
So, would you be interested?

10:27.251 --> 10:30.379
Or, you can shoot plasma bolts
at semi-random intervals.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.923
Ka-kow! Ka-ka-kow!

10:34.008 --> 10:35.217
I'll take doomsday.

10:35.885 --> 10:36.927
Ka-kow!

10:39.263 --> 10:40.556
What do you mean, "No?"

10:40.640 --> 10:42.892
The accepted opposite of, "Yes"?

10:42.975 --> 10:46.270
So we're not selling Mr. Deadly now?
Won't those spies be angry?

10:46.354 --> 10:49.231
And more importantly,
how does this affect our mix tape?

10:49.315 --> 10:50.941
Selling him would solve all our problems.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.111
He gets taken somewhere else
and gets to explode, we live.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.447
Except for the billions of life forms
he kills.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.200
Well, obviously, but they're
kind of a sunk cost at this point.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.576
That is not what that means.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.370
Oh, um, arbitrage?

11:02.453 --> 11:03.913
We can't be held responsible

11:03.996 --> 11:06.290
for the actions of the people
we sell weapons to.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.751
-Why not?
-Because we'd have to stop doing it.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.879
Look, I think Mr. Deadly
is making some real progress.

11:13.964 --> 11:17.676
The ice cream was good,
and that was a very pretty bug, if rude,

11:17.760 --> 11:21.931
but fulfilling the purpose of my existence
sounds a smidge better.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.683
But there must be something
in the universe you wanna do.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.103
I've heard good things about whiskey.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.439
Great job, Lana.
Now let's go get this bomb drunk.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.734
Lightweights.
That was only like a half a bottle...

11:33.818 --> 11:34.819
[snoring]

11:34.902 --> 11:37.988
...of Quaaludes
that I dissolved in their absinthe.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.616
Hmm... They may die.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.119
[gasps] Oh! Mr. Deadly!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.745
That's what I was doing.

11:45.746 --> 11:50.584
I say, that tastes like an old boot
on fire that I like in my mouth.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.002
I know it's your first time,

11:52.086 --> 11:54.839
but you don't have to try
literally every whiskey they have.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.925
Um, could you say, "Please detonate"?

11:58.342 --> 12:00.594
Say nothing. Walk away.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.055
Almost got you. [chuckles]

12:03.139 --> 12:04.640
I'll have these six.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.392
Not 100% sure this is working.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.686
Let's just go find those spies
and pawn him off.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.104
One, that's evil.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.398
Two, we don't even know
what they look like.

12:12.481 --> 12:15.109
Well, see that cat dude
and pouch master general?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.819
They look exactly like that.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.655
Doesn't look like they're here to haggle.
Time to go.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.740
And we're shuffling,
and they're working together,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.242
and they're cutting us off,
and they're here.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.327
Nice work, Tav.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.662
What's up with all the fist bumping?

12:26.745 --> 12:30.708
This is not a weapon.
It is a living being who does not want--

12:30.791 --> 12:34.086
Who's taking me? You? You?
Ah, we'll figure it out.

12:34.170 --> 12:38.424
Thanks, Lana. It's been... a delay?
But I'd like to explode now.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.509
Well, all that's left is for you to pay us

12:40.593 --> 12:42.344
and we'll leave
this portion of the galaxy--

12:42.428 --> 12:46.765
Oh. [laughs] You're not going anywhere.
I have a thing about loose ends.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.809
Is that why you have so many straps?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.270
Seriously,
are you on your way to tie down a blimp?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.605
Hey. Time to leave.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.149
We tend to frown
on threatening waiters with knives.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.276
Sir, we're handling this. [chuckles]

12:57.359 --> 12:59.278
Oh, is that right, Tycho Brahe?

12:59.361 --> 13:00.946
Astronomy burn.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.532
Come on,
did the groundwork for Copernicus,

13:03.616 --> 13:06.076
had a metal nose, Tycho Brahe.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.162
Ooh, long way to go for that one.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.247
[grunting]

13:15.628 --> 13:19.048
Hey, assholes. If he dies, he explodes!

13:19.131 --> 13:20.549
Well, you should have led with that!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.968
Oh, we're so sorry!

13:24.553 --> 13:27.598
[grunts] Goddamn it.
I think they used your stick thing.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.266
It's called a quarterstaff.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.354
Fine, they used your quarterstaff.
You have a gun.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.732
[Archer sighs]
We can lay low here for a while.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.278
Aw, cheer up, dude.
I bet you'll explode before you know it.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.073
Lana, you have snatched me
from my destiny.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.699
Yeah, she is a huge buzzkill.

13:45.783 --> 13:49.703
Look, I'm very partially sorry about that.
But we're gonna figure out what to do.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.914
Can you stay here for just a few minutes?

13:51.997 --> 13:55.709
Oh, great. I've waited thousands of years
so what's a few minutes?

13:56.335 --> 13:57.461
That's a yes, right?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.546
Yes.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.215
So, what do we do?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.260
Oh! Oh, not this.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.637
Just thought of another name
for Spaghetti Vacation.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.598
If you tell it to me, Pam,
I will literally kill you.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.809
Call it a one-way vacation to the void.

14:11.892 --> 14:12.893
Wait, that's something.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.230
Killing Pam? I was joking,
but if you've got a good reason I would--

14:16.313 --> 14:19.775
No, these depots all have a cargo railgun.
They're insanely powerful.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.735
-So?
-So we put him in it,

14:21.819 --> 14:23.404
aim it up out of the galactic plane,

14:23.487 --> 14:25.573
and radio the order
when he's at a safe distance.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.450
We'd have to get there
without those goons intercepting us.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.661
Seems tough. They're very cool.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.745
They're not that cool.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.955
Okay, let's ask him.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.290
-[crashing]
-[Cheryl] Ha!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.375
Teach you to lock me in a room.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.463
Because I locked you in a room! Ha-ha!
Are you guys getting that?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.632
I can't see if the irony is landing.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.676
Why not open the door and check?

14:45.759 --> 14:49.346
[Cheryl] I can't, I smashed it. Okay, bye.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.681
Okay, bye. We're gonna die.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.058
If we are, there's something
I need you guys to know.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.477
"Ravioliday"!

14:56.896 --> 14:57.980
Worth it.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.066
[sighs] I am ready.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.568
Take me!

15:02.651 --> 15:06.822
You may have some unhealthy associations
with sex and death.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.490
Duh-hoi.

15:10.993 --> 15:15.080
Uh-huh. So you know
you don't have any junk, right?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.000
Well, if you give me a moment
I'm sure I can grow one.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.668
Why don't you make it two?

15:23.213 --> 15:25.758
That was... my God.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.468
Ugh! It's gonna be one of those.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.930
How can sensations that majestic
and world-shattering

15:31.013 --> 15:34.350
be contained
in such strange dangly skin-bags?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.769
Did the world shatter for you
in the first ten seconds,

15:36.852 --> 15:39.688
the second ten seconds, or...
huh, no other options.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.649
Both. Benefit of two, I suppose.

15:41.732 --> 15:45.319
But, oddly, I find
a limpid rush of passion in myself,

15:45.402 --> 15:46.695
and I must tell you--

15:46.779 --> 15:47.947
Sorry, what was your name?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.782
[clears throat]
There's some debate on that.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.951
Well, whatever it is, I love you.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.911
Yes, well... nap.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.413
Can you at least tell me to detonate?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.583
God, can you stop your dumb mouth
from talking so I can sleep?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.586
Okay. Well, I'm gonna destroy you all now.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.255
As long as it's quiet! Rude!

16:05.923 --> 16:07.091
What did you just do?

16:07.174 --> 16:09.677
I don't know. I wasn't listening either.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.512
Unfortunately, we were,

16:11.595 --> 16:13.806
and there are some things
you can't unhear.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.266
Yeah, like why was it so squelchy?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.727
-Well--
-Nope. Where did he go?

16:18.811 --> 16:19.853
Who?

16:19.937 --> 16:23.357
Let's see. Let's wind the footage back
to the moment they left the cantina--

16:23.440 --> 16:25.859
Pff. Cantina? Barely a saloon.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.195
Or that.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.863
Last one to grab him buys tacos?

16:30.614 --> 16:34.243
Ugh. Set me up the whole way.
Ugh. Respect.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.703

-We got to go.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.835
Give me a minute.
I think I was just dead a little.

Uh, no thank you.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.203
Ah-ha!

Fantastic. And now this is happening.

-Ow.
-Nice shooting, Tex,

17:29.173 --> 17:30.966
Oh, hi. They're from the ship.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.885
Yep. We are here to stop you.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.845
Is that a kimono?

17:35.888 --> 17:39.475
These are experimental prototypes.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.351
I call gun. Big gun, here.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.103
That leaves Pam the temporary--

17:43.187 --> 17:45.564
Don't need it, dick-nuts.
My body is a weapon.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.734
-Speaking of which.
-The temporary singularity grenade?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.070
Why would you make that?
Why not just give us an ancient horn

17:51.153 --> 17:54.573
that summons Cthulhu's older,
shittier step-brother?

17:54.656 --> 17:57.242
Well, it imprinted on you now,
so no one else can use it.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.537
Seems like a needless precaution.
So, where do you think they are?

18:00.621 --> 18:01.622
[lasers zapping]

18:01.705 --> 18:04.958
I find it's good practice
to follow the sound of gunfire.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.418
That hadn't happened yet.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.380
Oh, suppressing fire!

Ah, ah, ah!

18:12.174 --> 18:14.468
Yelling "suppressing fire"
kind of defeats the point.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.345
We're supposed to think
you're aiming at us.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.765

18:26.438 --> 18:28.107
They're actually doing okay.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.609
I might have a tiny bit more respect
for them.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.027
Don't ever tell them I said that.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.696
There is so much so deeply wrong with you.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.658

[panting] How long before they notice--

18:44.039 --> 18:46.875

Oh, this is the best I've ever felt.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.656
Yeah, you're probably gonna
want to check into rehab.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.908
Like immediately. You forgot this.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.744
I came as quick as I could.
You know, after they died.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.247
You are a paragon of bravery.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.082
All right, let's shoot you into space.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.209
-One moment.
-Oh, come on.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.836
Lana's act of selflessness inspired me.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.922
She was willing
to give her life for others,

20:57.005 --> 21:01.635
and that gives me the courage to change.
I choose life.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.012
I guess this means no tacos.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.139
[scoffs] Is that supposed to be a joke?

21:06.223 --> 21:07.891
I didn't mean to make it weird. [grunts]

21:07.975 --> 21:09.643
How's this for weird?

21:09.726 --> 21:12.020
Please detonate.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.814
-[all] No!
-[Lana] Don't detonate!

21:16.024 --> 21:18.986
I think my change of heart
may have diffused me.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.862
Only now do I see

21:20.946 --> 21:24.157
that when one's purpose is evil,
achieving that--

21:24.241 --> 21:25.450
[howling]

21:25.534 --> 21:26.660
[all scream]

21:26.743 --> 21:28.912
-Archer, you've got to use this.
-[whimpering]

21:28.996 --> 21:31.999
I don't want to be eternal spaghetti,
Lana.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.751
For once,
think of anyone other than yourself.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.129
Argh! Fine!

21:38.422 --> 21:39.965
[beeping]

21:42.301 --> 21:44.469
[whooshing]

21:50.559 --> 21:53.812
[all yelling]

21:59.443 --> 22:00.527
[sighing]

22:00.610 --> 22:02.571
-I'm alive.
-[Archer] We're alive!

22:02.654 --> 22:04.072
-[Pam] Wow.
-[Ray] Close one, right guys?

22:04.156 --> 22:08.410
[groans] Yeah, great.
I think I twisted my ankle. Thanks, Lana.

22:08.493 --> 22:10.662
So, where exactly did they go?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.790
It's semi-random,
but I could try to back-calculate it--

22:13.874 --> 22:15.625
I'd kind of prefer to not know

22:15.709 --> 22:19.421
if we wiped out several thriving
and culturally complex civilizations.

22:19.504 --> 22:20.922
-Yeah, I mean, me too.
-[overlapping chatter]

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
[explosion]

22:26.053 --> 22:27.846
We don't know that was us.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.559
[theme music playing]
