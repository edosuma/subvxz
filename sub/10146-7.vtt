00:03.005 --> 00:04.316
Welcome to North Korea.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.330
It's been a long time.

00:08.856 --> 00:10.050
Don't get too close.

00:11.265 --> 00:13.758
We need to put C4 charges
in four different areas in the plant.

00:14.269 --> 00:16.036
You have no idea what <i>20</i> are capable of.

00:18.315 --> 00:19.089
All these for nothing!

00:20.109 --> 00:22.385
The target is right! Perhaps there is
still something to be gained!

00:22.527 --> 00:24.173
Let him go!
- You speak, or he dies.

00:24.517 --> 00:28.347
We were ordered, to covertly
go into North Korea.

00:29.814 --> 00:30.998
We cannot abandon them.

00:31.569 --> 00:33.346
You have contacts on
the Russian-Korean border.

00:34.079 --> 00:37.457
They're looking for someone to blame
Joon-Soo, this is the time to choose sides.

00:38.116 --> 00:40.666
They whispers about a
high-level attack in Europe.

00:41.173 --> 00:43.555
Well, we brought the fight to North Korea,
now they're bringing it back to us.

03:21.334 --> 03:22.092
I've got something.

03:22.476 --> 03:23.201
And?

04:06.129 --> 04:07.688
She has cloned Myshkin's phone.

04:08.615 --> 04:09.479
But she's scared.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.956
Well, we need the intel. If Kwon is
still here, he can lead us to Li-Na.

04:13.271 --> 04:13.825
You're gonna get it.

04:15.156 --> 04:16.737
But you'll just have to do it Nadya's way.

04:17.208 --> 04:17.666
And what was that?

04:18.909 --> 04:20.005
You're gonna need tuxedos.

04:20.591 --> 04:21.420
What?

04:43.928 --> 04:49.462
Strike Back: Legacy Episode 6
Subbed by c2lia

05:03.997 --> 05:04.517
Here.

05:05.438 --> 05:05.797
Dude!

05:06.484 --> 05:07.485
Alright!

05:18.508 --> 05:20.550
I just gotta say,

05:22.217 --> 05:23.164
You're absolutely beautiful.

05:24.779 --> 05:25.189
I know.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.917
There, that's better.

05:31.957 --> 05:32.506
Let's do it.

05:35.551 --> 05:37.619
So uh, what's with
the opera house?

05:38.692 --> 05:41.306
Dansky and I, our first
mission together,

05:41.519 --> 05:42.737
this was the ???.

05:43.163 --> 05:44.709
So she thinks it's
her lucky charm.

05:46.897 --> 05:50.056
On the bright side, it is a chance to ???
Sgt. Damien here with some culture.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.742
I got culture coming
out of my ass.

05:53.201 --> 05:56.414
Most operas involve sex, violence, death and
betrayal. So yes, this should be right up your alley.

05:56.546 --> 05:57.370
See that sounds good.

05:58.241 --> 06:02.491
But, ... any way you want. Now this is gonna be
some fat chicks singing with horns up on their helmet.

06:02.851 --> 06:03.285
She's here.

06:04.527 --> 06:06.860
First floor, box number one.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.396
Who's this?
-It's ok, he's with me.

06:36.823 --> 06:37.503
You can trust him.

06:41.147 --> 06:42.612
I'm Scott.
Damien Scott.

06:45.348 --> 06:47.217
Are you ok?
You have the intel?

06:48.364 --> 06:51.149
He's made me Nina. Myshkin
knows I'm undercover.

06:52.082 --> 06:54.637
He's gonna come after me, isn't he? Just like he did with

06:54.624 --> 06:56.547
No, no. You're out now ok?

06:56.723 --> 06:57.149
You're out.

06:58.083 --> 06:58.717
You believe me.

07:00.455 --> 07:00.907
Yes.

07:05.143 --> 07:08.685
There is a meet involving
Kwon tomorrow morning.

07:09.236 --> 07:11.317
What you want,
is on here.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.870
I just need something from you.

07:14.363 --> 07:14.960
And what is that?

07:16.437 --> 07:20.692
I need out, of this
city, this country.

07:21.427 --> 07:24.237
New name, new
identity, new start.

07:25.088 --> 07:27.115
That's fine.
You got it.

07:27.813 --> 07:28.303
New start.

07:43.531 --> 07:43.876
Enough!

07:50.293 --> 07:51.327
Let's go.
On me, on me.

07:51.365 --> 07:52.729
I could have taken him.

08:09.924 --> 08:10.792
Come on, come
on, come on!

08:21.652 --> 08:22.319
RV one?

08:22.942 --> 08:24.117
Roger that.
In position.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.901
Did you get it?
- We got it but we lost Dansky.

08:30.502 --> 08:31.677
Police are inbound,
we gotta move.

08:40.455 --> 08:41.917
You should've let me get Myshkin.

08:43.001 --> 08:43.466
I know.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.477
But the mission comes first.

08:46.206 --> 08:46.877
Sorry.

08:51.746 --> 08:52.281
Nina.

08:54.303 --> 08:55.582
I am sorry about your friend.

09:01.317 --> 09:02.177
This will fix things.

09:09.308 --> 09:10.007
To Dansky.

09:13.861 --> 09:14.421
To Dansky.

09:25.628 --> 09:27.935
So you've dealt with Myshkin
before, haven't you?

09:31.201 --> 09:31.825
Yeah.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.197
Eight years ago,

09:38.259 --> 09:40.700
he was selling arms to
defend terrorrist organisation.

09:41.945 --> 09:43.621
So the FSB put
me undercover.

09:46.810 --> 09:48.477
I was his girlfriend
for two years.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.546
Then, he found out.

09:57.982 --> 09:59.433
Myshkin likes to hurt people.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.268
Got off on it.

10:04.589 --> 10:05.796
Nina, you don't
have to tell me.

10:06.013 --> 10:08.345
Afterwards, I was
in pieces.

10:11.076 --> 10:13.558
Nadya, she really
helped me.

10:20.557 --> 10:21.258
Shit.

10:22.886 --> 10:23.744
It's my fault.

10:26.343 --> 10:27.053
Nina,

10:27.676 --> 10:28.578
it's not your fault.

10:29.341 --> 10:30.596
I need you to make
me a promise.

10:31.761 --> 10:32.203
What's that?

10:32.416 --> 10:33.344
That I will have Myshkin.

10:35.168 --> 10:35.790
I need that.

10:37.469 --> 10:37.917
Alright.

10:39.455 --> 10:40.069
You got it.

10:42.882 --> 10:43.743
I promise.

11:41.345 --> 11:43.665
Let's see if Myshkin's
phone has what we need.

11:45.321 --> 11:48.564
Dansky said there was a meet
tomorrow at eleven involving Kwon.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.457
Here it is.

11:57.884 --> 11:58.832
<i>Oppenheimer</i>.

12:03.165 --> 12:03.498
What is it?

12:04.455 --> 12:05.338
Does the name mean
something to you?

12:06.519 --> 12:10.179
<i>Oppenheimer</i>  was the codename of a master
bomber active during the troubles in Northern Ireland.

12:10.141 --> 12:11.213
Huh, which side?

12:13.476 --> 12:14.534
Which side boss?
- Eh, both.

12:16.338 --> 12:17.896
??? won't accept the highest bidder.

12:18.894 --> 12:20.109
Never managed to ID him.

12:22.823 --> 12:24.757
This photograph, is
as close as we got.

12:26.174 --> 12:27.649
... his handywork though.

12:30.025 --> 12:30.552
Bloody hell ...

12:32.263 --> 12:34.325
We've had intel on him for the last ten years.

12:34.627 --> 12:37.968
Terrorist attacks, bombs,
Palestine, Ukraine, Chechnya.

12:39.254 --> 12:40.825
Never managed to confirm it was him.

12:42.505 --> 12:45.942
And there's a reason why he'd stayed alive so
long because he is like no one we have ever faced.

12:46.242 --> 12:47.853
And if he's teaming up
with Kwon and Li-Na,

12:49.267 --> 12:50.255
God knows what they're planning.

12:53.008 --> 12:54.948
<i>Oppenheimer</i>  is the
real deal Michael.

13:27.804 --> 13:28.547
Ok, listen up.

13:29.060 --> 13:32.002
Do not engage target until
we know Kwon is present.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.934
He's our best and only lead to Li-Na.

13:35.922 --> 13:36.693
So we scare him off,

13:37.531 --> 13:38.563
we've got nothing.

13:38.702 --> 13:39.297
Got that.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.065
I got the north end.

13:41.656 --> 13:42.506
I got south.

13:43.802 --> 13:46.705
Line of sight, east
west, I'm on it.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.809
Power station now.
No sign of him.

14:44.338 --> 14:48.237
Bravo team stand by, I have eyes on
Kwon. I repeat, confirmation of Kwon.

14:49.135 --> 14:50.412
He's approaching from the north west.

14:52.410 --> 14:53.024
Eyes on target.

14:53.711 --> 14:55.891
Coming down the west side of
stairs from the train station.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.578
Stay on him.

15:00.956 --> 15:01.809
Moving in to position.

15:19.678 --> 15:21.752
Scott, hold position!
- I can take him down now.

15:22.079 --> 15:23.904
That's a negative! Let's see
who he's come to meet!

15:24.917 --> 15:26.221
That fucker tortured my child.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.016
Scott, stay on mission!

15:29.867 --> 15:31.077
Copy that sir.

15:55.977 --> 15:59.478
Target's sitting down with a man in
his mid-50s wearing a gray overcoat.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.652
That's gotta be him. That's
gotta be <i>Oppenheimer</i>.

16:09.048 --> 16:09.896
You aren't comfortable?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.949
We agreed, no ???
contact. Not yet.

16:14.167 --> 16:15.041
Nina, you getting this?

16:19.276 --> 16:20.422
I like to look a man in the eys.

16:21.926 --> 16:23.757
Tell me so much more than words.

16:27.425 --> 16:28.164
You're good.

16:29.023 --> 16:31.118
Because there's a slight air
of desperation of you.

16:31.815 --> 16:32.666
Of need.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.824
So the price has just doubled.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.724
Consider much your eyes committed
there I think that's reasonable.

16:41.203 --> 16:41.999
Very well.

16:45.116 --> 16:46.230
New account number.

16:59.364 --> 17:00.963
Micheal, take <i>Oppenheimer</i>.
- Yeah, roger that.

17:01.292 --> 17:05.371
Scott, Kwon's yours.
- And then uh, coffee ...

17:06.280 --> 17:07.000
Thanks buddy.

17:08.806 --> 17:09.290
I got him.

17:18.940 --> 17:19.757
Mind if I join you?

17:23.114 --> 17:24.190
My team is watching you.

17:25.059 --> 17:26.156
My advice is ???.

17:27.882 --> 17:29.052
Suppose you're a <i>forces</i>
right? British obviously?

17:31.323 --> 17:32.186
Tactical boots?

17:33.108 --> 17:35.943
Watch turned inside to protect that you're in action?

17:36.885 --> 17:38.196
All those regulation issue.

17:38.436 --> 17:41.350
So many of your type like something
a little bit more ostentatious.

17:41.692 --> 17:43.766
So I'm guessing you're a company man hm?

17:44.612 --> 17:45.258
You're a good boy.

17:46.578 --> 17:48.372
Institutionalised even.

17:49.891 --> 17:51.405
You'll make top rank eventually.

17:52.276 --> 17:54.377
Just by the fact that
you've cling on for so long.

17:55.652 --> 17:57.662
How am I doing?
- Not bad.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.430
I'm not sure it changes the
fundamentals of this though.

18:02.299 --> 18:03.759
You need to run
along now sonny.

18:04.510 --> 18:07.761
I'm the one with the gun.
- Yeah and I'm the one holding the remote control trigger.

18:09.778 --> 18:11.775
That's right soldier,
there's a bomb here.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.757
I clicked this pen, ten
seconds later, boom!

18:29.747 --> 18:31.645
Or I can disarm it. It's as
simple as that. Up to you.

18:32.482 --> 18:34.042
Lots of good for doing crosswords.

18:34.016 --> 18:35.042
Or for bluffing.

18:35.756 --> 18:36.863
Oh, no bluff.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.507
Big bomb.

18:39.236 --> 18:40.665
Never leave home without one.

18:43.871 --> 18:45.213
Secret of my longevity.

18:47.788 --> 18:51.961
Just think of all the damage done to
these families, these children huh?

18:52.669 --> 18:53.337
Tragic.

18:54.721 --> 18:56.397
Do you really want that in your conscience huh?

18:57.411 --> 18:58.648
For your sins.

19:26.316 --> 19:27.206
He's got a bomb.

19:29.105 --> 19:31.305
Keep <i>Oppenheimer</i>  in place.
Do not let him go.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.262
I'm not afraid to die!

20:00.267 --> 20:02.412
Really? Well, you're
not gonna die yet!

20:08.844 --> 20:09.338
Stay!

20:11.216 --> 20:12.197
Ten seconds.

20:13.267 --> 20:14.557
Save them?
Or catch me?

20:15.262 --> 20:16.317
Can't do both.

20:17.439 --> 20:17.871
Shit!

20:18.236 --> 20:19.837
Bomb!
Move, move!

20:20.921 --> 20:21.717
Move, move, move!

20:23.030 --> 20:23.537
Get out of there!

20:24.517 --> 20:26.245
Move!
Get out!

20:26.485 --> 20:28.473
Yesterday, upon the stair ...

20:29.537 --> 20:31.384
... I met a man,
who wasn't there ...

20:32.565 --> 20:34.177
... He wasn't there again today ...

20:34.536 --> 20:36.030
Shit!
Move!

20:36.054 --> 20:36.488
I wish, ...

20:37.203 --> 20:37.817
Come here, come
here, come here!

20:38.036 --> 20:38.801
... I wish, ...

20:39.828 --> 20:41.288
... he'd go away.

21:05.196 --> 21:05.731
No!

21:07.071 --> 21:08.456
That was a risk
we're taking sir.

21:08.929 --> 21:09.493
A risk?

21:09.951 --> 21:12.614
Philip, a bomb was detonated in the heart of
Vienna and the man responsible got away!

21:13.236 --> 21:14.214
Yeah but we got Kwon.

21:14.956 --> 21:18.979
Do you know the nightmare that's in store for us if
anyone knew the British military intelligence has been there?

21:19.419 --> 21:20.155
Especially after Korea.

21:21.245 --> 21:23.942
Oh, sweetheart darling. No, no, don't eat that.
It's dirty. I'll buy you another one.

21:24.221 --> 21:24.571
Charles?

21:27.916 --> 21:32.701
With all due respect, if the North Korean are teaming up with
the Russian mafia and the world's most infamous bomb-maker, ...

21:34.106 --> 21:35.254
... I think the nightmare still to come.

21:35.801 --> 21:37.294
And what intelligence has Kwon given us?

21:43.343 --> 21:44.256
How's that feel?

21:45.082 --> 21:45.567
Huh?

21:47.325 --> 21:48.024
Nothing?

21:50.684 --> 21:53.280
You want to give me a towel or
this fucker.

21:53.934 --> 21:55.428
Let's ask him some question first huh?

21:56.671 --> 21:57.296
Yeah?

21:58.596 --> 21:59.590
What you're doing in Vienna?

22:00.620 --> 22:02.317
You want to tell us what
it is Li-Na wants here?

22:06.950 --> 22:07.936
You're not gonna answer, ...

22:08.839 --> 22:09.410
... huh?

22:10.021 --> 22:11.265
I will answer you.

22:14.619 --> 22:16.123
You should've never
come to Korea.

22:17.528 --> 22:20.305
If you invade our land we'll bring
the fight right to your door.

22:21.816 --> 22:23.158
Everything that happens now, ...

22:24.219 --> 22:25.882
... every drop of
blood that's spilled, ...

22:27.371 --> 22:28.210
... is on your hand.

22:30.632 --> 22:31.654
How does that feel?

22:35.267 --> 22:36.245
...

22:37.423 --> 22:38.893
... huh?
Where's Li-Na?

22:40.149 --> 22:40.967
No?

22:41.900 --> 22:42.471
Where is she?

22:43.350 --> 22:44.359
Where is that fucking bitch?

22:50.014 --> 22:51.508
Sure can take a
beating, can he?

22:52.196 --> 22:52.650
Yeah.

22:53.785 --> 22:55.508
We used to have these
kind of interrogation training.

22:57.482 --> 22:58.545
He's not gonna
give up Li-Na.

22:58.948 --> 22:59.736
Not conciously anyway.

23:00.942 --> 23:01.567
We'll see.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.120
Want to talk about Locke?

23:13.933 --> 23:14.846
About him and <i>Oppenheimer</i> ?

23:15.814 --> 23:16.202
Yeah.

23:17.049 --> 23:17.877
In the square.

23:18.661 --> 23:20.037
He left his post.
- Yeah.

23:21.029 --> 23:22.718
Chasing directly,
on his own.

23:24.414 --> 23:25.319
It's about Locke's son.

23:25.836 --> 23:26.389
What, that car bomb?

23:26.685 --> 23:26.991
Yeah.

23:27.465 --> 23:28.239
In Northern Ireland?

23:29.036 --> 23:30.079
He thinks it was <i>Oppenheimer</i>.

23:32.185 --> 23:32.864
Just keep an eye on him.

23:33.503 --> 23:34.429
No mission creep.

23:35.965 --> 23:36.569
Oh yeah.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.205
Locke.

24:19.254 --> 24:19.809
Nina?

24:19.974 --> 24:21.106
I've picked up
Myshkin again.

24:22.139 --> 24:23.580
PTRA Construction.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.624
It's a company he
uses as a front.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.763
Money launderings, smugglings ...

24:28.196 --> 24:28.739
Is <i>Oppenheimer</i>
with him?

24:29.042 --> 24:31.428
No it's just Myshkin,
and some extra muscles.

24:33.334 --> 24:34.596
I don't know what
he's up to yet.

24:35.356 --> 24:37.716
But he's not building any
orphanages that's for sure.

24:37.774 --> 24:38.371
Stay with him.

24:38.764 --> 24:41.789
Trust me, I'm not letting this
bastard out of my sight, ...

24:42.045 --> 24:42.749
... ever, again.

24:46.683 --> 24:47.325
Myshkin's on the move.

24:49.039 --> 24:49.930
I'm going to follow him.

24:50.397 --> 24:50.916
Copy that.

24:58.041 --> 25:00.439
This ain't working Mikey.
We're not gonna get to Li-Na.

25:03.610 --> 25:04.503
I say we step
things up.

25:07.006 --> 25:07.469
Meaning?

25:30.718 --> 25:31.990
???

25:48.360 --> 25:48.838
Thirsty?

25:55.956 --> 25:57.268
Oi! This isn't what
we discussed!

25:57.773 --> 25:58.369
Yes it is.

25:58.863 --> 26:00.424
I've told you I'll step things up and you agreed.

26:00.799 --> 26:02.962
Besides, I was gonna give him a drink, loosen his tougue.

26:03.350 --> 26:04.302
You're thirsty aren't you?
Huh?

26:04.716 --> 26:07.182
Last chance, where's
your girlfriend?

26:07.759 --> 26:09.212
Huh? Nothing?

26:17.198 --> 26:19.059
What? Still thirsty?
- Alright, that's enough.

26:19.284 --> 26:20.775
You want some more?
Here!

26:23.502 --> 26:25.196
That's enough! Damien
Scott! That's enough!

26:25.396 --> 26:27.341
Huh? What's enough
Mike? Huh?

26:27.185 --> 26:27.583
Fucks sake!

26:28.292 --> 26:31.918
What's enough? It's enough that killed Julia?
It's enough that shot my fucking son?

26:32.530 --> 26:33.973
We have a code.

26:34.424 --> 26:35.368
No, you have a code!
I'm doing my fucking job!

26:35.533 --> 26:37.522
Even if this is your job,
you're enjoying this too much!

26:38.985 --> 26:39.933
Know what your problem is Michael?
- Tell me.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.570
You had no vision.

26:42.150 --> 26:43.239
All you ever
done is march.

26:43.733 --> 26:44.541
Stand with the flag.

26:45.303 --> 26:46.895
At least I got a life,
outside the army.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.413
At least I'm not a
borderline psycopath.

26:51.583 --> 26:54.680
You know what sometimes I think you want the people
nearest to you to get hurt just so you have an excuse.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.387
Now fuck you Mike!

26:55.801 --> 26:57.663
Damien get out of here right now.
Take a walk.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.158
There you go!

26:59.468 --> 27:01.480
Get out of here.
I mean it. Calling this off!

27:01.943 --> 27:05.369
Hold his hands, sing kumbaya, say
that fucking word for him Michael!

27:05.757 --> 27:06.288
Piss off!
- Fuck you!

27:06.797 --> 27:07.570
Fuck!

27:09.973 --> 27:10.523
Stand up!

27:13.099 --> 27:15.957
I may not agree with his method
but this interrogation is far from over!

27:19.371 --> 27:19.976
Turn around.

27:21.855 --> 27:23.997
I know you understand me,
turn around!

28:09.777 --> 28:10.918
You're right,
he kicks hard.

28:13.612 --> 28:16.557
Alright, good signal. Zero!
Raven is up and running.

28:17.208 --> 28:17.821
Roger that.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.807
Just hold back,
don't spook him.

28:21.452 --> 28:22.463
Just let the tracker
do the work.

28:22.882 --> 28:23.903
Copy that.

28:25.231 --> 28:25.866
Let's hope this works.

28:26.510 --> 28:27.580
The fuck he wasn't gonna talk.
- Yeah.

28:28.057 --> 28:30.283
You were pretty
convincing there.

28:31.646 --> 28:32.571
Almost sound like
you meant it.

28:33.677 --> 28:36.266
May not having a life outside army.
- Well I had to sell it.

28:37.404 --> 28:38.491
Didn't do too bad yourself.

28:39.081 --> 28:40.510
I mean me being
borderline psycopath?

28:40.891 --> 28:44.751
Huh? Oh that be yeah well, like you said,
I had to sell it. I mean fuck you.

28:52.696 --> 28:53.237
Still got him?

28:53.631 --> 28:54.260
Yeah we still
got him.

29:02.184 --> 29:03.988
Oi, oi, oi. Back off,
don't spook him.

29:05.304 --> 29:06.664
Scott, you're gonna
get your chance mate.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.002
Trust me.
- Yeah.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.797
And when you do, give him
a kick for me too. - Will do.

29:11.848 --> 29:12.602
Quite happily.

29:29.377 --> 29:31.709
He's just turn left and he
stop one click north off here.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.041
Take the next right.

29:43.727 --> 29:44.664
Yeah he should
be near here.

29:47.586 --> 29:48.619
He's very close.

29:49.102 --> 29:49.804
Take this next left.

29:52.588 --> 29:53.116
And after that,

29:53.864 --> 29:54.312
Shit!

29:54.790 --> 29:55.858
What?
- I've lost the signal.

29:56.837 --> 29:57.923
Zero, I've lost
the signal!

29:58.545 --> 29:58.895
Bollocks!

30:02.241 --> 30:02.650
There it is.

30:03.294 --> 30:03.720
Shit!

30:04.396 --> 30:05.437
Bollocks.
Eye's on Scott.

30:08.281 --> 30:08.896
Windows.
- Yep.

30:14.082 --> 30:15.223
No.
- Ah shit!

30:15.739 --> 30:16.741
How the hell could
you lost him?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.989
My fault. Scott wanted to go
after him but I told him not to.

30:20.309 --> 30:22.820
Oh great! Do you want to get on the
phone to Whitehall and explain that?

30:23.620 --> 30:26.233
Alright, listen up. Liaise with
Nina. She's on Myshkin.

30:27.521 --> 30:28.557
Just find a way back in.

30:28.996 --> 30:29.698
Yeah roger that!

30:46.441 --> 30:47.099
It's her.

30:50.580 --> 30:51.597
Ma'am let me help
you with those please.

30:51.797 --> 30:52.797
I'm ok.

30:52.997 --> 30:53.997
No, no.
I insist.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.856
Now think of your baby,
and you'll survive.

31:01.499 --> 31:02.557
Get in the car.

31:13.644 --> 31:14.540
Your husband's back.

31:15.076 --> 31:15.776
Go there now.

31:27.858 --> 31:28.557
Give me your phone.

31:29.796 --> 31:30.515
Give me your phone!

32:07.756 --> 32:09.133
I got your
target in sight.

32:10.369 --> 32:10.951
He's got Kwon?

32:11.402 --> 32:13.113
No, the principal.
Li-Na.

32:15.006 --> 32:17.863
Nina, don't let that bitch
out of your sight. - I won't.

32:19.391 --> 32:22.717
She just entered Solar Private Bank on ???

32:23.617 --> 32:26.267
I'm gonna follow her.
- Roger that.

32:42.182 --> 32:43.700
I speak English,
Mr. Hauser.

32:44.356 --> 32:47.529
Oh good! My Korean is
I'm afraid rather poor.

32:48.109 --> 32:51.883
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person. Please come this way.

33:10.370 --> 33:11.662
Fucking move!
Move!

33:14.991 --> 33:15.699
Watch out, watch
out, watch out!

33:23.422 --> 33:25.013
Let's get there in
one piece eh mate?

33:26.156 --> 33:27.280
Who am I driving?
Miss Daisy?

33:27.861 --> 33:28.764
Jesus Christ.

33:29.247 --> 33:30.559
She's talking to the manager.

33:31.559 --> 33:32.506
Went to his office.

33:33.117 --> 33:36.019
Well we know Kwon has contact
??? ten years ago.

33:37.769 --> 33:41.337
But why would Li-Na expose
herself, at a bank now?

33:41.876 --> 33:43.002
Well there must be
something she wants there.

33:43.484 --> 33:44.188
What a bank?
She's fucking loaded.

33:44.604 --> 33:45.454
Say why don't we go find out, shall we?

33:45.806 --> 33:47.022
Roger that.

33:47.473 --> 33:49.228
Sending you the grid reference ...

33:49.649 --> 33:50.108
... now.

33:51.756 --> 33:52.423
Yeah copy that.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.643
Thank you for meeting
at such short notice.

33:59.019 --> 34:02.617
Of course. I'm always happy to
accomodate my North Korean friends.

34:03.454 --> 34:04.841
How long have you been
working at the embassy?

34:05.324 --> 34:06.398
I'm not from the embassy.

34:07.167 --> 34:10.150
Oh, I understood that you're
a new posting from Pyongyang.

34:10.956 --> 34:15.658
No. On the contrary, the regime would
be most unhappy if they knew I was here.

34:17.815 --> 34:20.565
But the reference code you gave me ...
- Was a little old.

34:21.123 --> 34:22.896
You should be more
careful Mr. Hauser.

34:23.422 --> 34:25.529
You've become,
complacent.

34:26.998 --> 34:30.147
Heh Miss Lau, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

34:30.683 --> 34:37.286
It's very simple. You are going to give me
the content of this safety deposit box.

34:41.835 --> 34:42.813
Oh I wouldn't
do such thing.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.060
Oh yes,
you would.

34:49.568 --> 34:50.420
Martalena!

34:50.958 --> 34:52.724
Fuck! Kwon's here!

34:53.322 --> 34:55.524
No! What you
doing with her?

34:57.851 --> 34:59.516
Hi there! How are you doing?
- Hello!

35:00.504 --> 35:04.376
Someone called us. There's a water leaking on
the second floor. We just come to fix it.

35:39.284 --> 35:42.048
They're taking the bank.
I need backup, now.

35:42.483 --> 35:46.028
Li-Na, Kwon, and maybe
ten armed men.

35:52.741 --> 35:54.133
No one else needs 
to get hurt.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.139
We're only here 
for one thing.

35:57.061 --> 35:57.913
Take us to the vault.

36:02.583 --> 36:03.837
There's something in the
vault that she wants.

36:08.040 --> 36:08.880
Oh, shit!

36:23.745 --> 36:24.489
Nina.
- Shit.

36:24.724 --> 36:25.148
Nina!

36:26.036 --> 36:27.123
That doesn't 
sound too good.

36:27.243 --> 36:29.565
It's two clicks north of here. Keep on 
this road. It's on the right-hand side.

36:51.178 --> 36:53.070
If you will be so 
kind Mr. Hauser.

36:53.501 --> 36:55.837
Doesn't matter if I opened the door 
I can't open the vault itself!

36:56.468 --> 36:57.373
We don't need 
you for that.

37:29.604 --> 37:30.445
Zero, we're at
the bank now.

37:30.876 --> 37:31.502
Roger that.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.083
Excuse me ma'am, I need to borrow that.
- Oh that's charming!

37:40.085 --> 37:42.116
Fucking where that is?
- I have no idea.

37:43.526 --> 37:44.239
Well let's ask this guy.

37:44.830 --> 37:49.182
Hey excuse me? Yeah I know, I know, we're tourist.
I'm American. I just want to know about that stage ...

38:34.664 --> 38:35.322
Boy or girl?

38:36.363 --> 38:37.053
What?

38:37.750 --> 38:38.697
It's a girl.

38:39.213 --> 38:40.256
She's a girl.

38:41.492 --> 38:44.427
Teach her to be strong, 
to trust in herself.

38:45.522 --> 38:49.342
Not to be weak and pathetic, 
leaning on a man as weak as him.

38:51.722 --> 38:53.734
No, not here.
Put her with the others.

38:54.184 --> 38:57.859
No, this one is FSB agent.
She's been after me a long time.

38:58.493 --> 38:59.285
Then kill her.

38:59.785 --> 39:02.460
No, I'm going to do
much more than that.

39:13.448 --> 39:13.881
Fuck!

39:14.879 --> 39:16.851
You're gonna me a 
cover as I cross there?

39:19.461 --> 39:19.968
You ready?

39:21.289 --> 39:21.742
Go!

39:24.957 --> 39:25.398
Shit!

39:26.626 --> 39:29.157
From Bangkok, to the 
Motherland, to Europe.

39:29.498 --> 39:30.237
They won't 
stop us.

39:30.581 --> 39:31.443
They followed
you here.

39:31.929 --> 39:32.981
No, impossible.

39:33.401 --> 39:35.121
No matter now.
We have work to do.

39:36.317 --> 39:37.302
Is the 
exit clear?

39:38.876 --> 39:39.917
Everything's standing by.

39:40.883 --> 39:43.721
We knew this would happen.
- I am familiar with their tenacity.

40:26.269 --> 40:26.677
Fuck!

40:31.676 --> 40:34.400
Psst, where's the vault? The vault?
- Downstairs.

40:34.716 --> 40:35.240
Downstairs.

40:44.186 --> 40:44.671
Bring the box.

41:17.587 --> 41:18.916
Coming up.

41:19.716 --> 41:20.993
Cheers mate.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.373
I thought you people were 
master cyber criminal.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.517
Couldn't we just hack what 
you want from this place?

41:27.557 --> 41:30.597
We know there's truly nothing 
secret in the cyber world.

41:30.963 --> 41:34.358
But what's in there,
 there's only one now.

41:35.304 --> 41:36.100
What are you talking?

41:36.669 --> 41:40.375
