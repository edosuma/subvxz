WEBVTT

00:38.872 --> 00:40.457
(door creaks)

00:45.045 --> 00:46.254
(sighs)

00:59.851 --> 01:01.394
(phone beeping)

01:02.103 --> 01:04.356
(line ringing)

01:05.357 --> 01:06.399
Charlie: (over phone)
Yeah?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.734
Charlie.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.362
Long time no time.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.241
You know who this is?

01:15.283 --> 01:18.536
Charlie: Mr. Sterling.
Yeah, it's, uh, been a while.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.704
My God, kid.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.707
It's a mess, isn't it?

01:27.962 --> 01:29.839
Just spoke to
the medical examiner.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.260
There wasn't enough
of my son

01:34.302 --> 01:36.137
for me to even identify.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.641
It's a fucking mess, kid.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.607
I let you off once,
Charlie.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.775
Gave you a life.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.528
Pretty good life, right?

01:53.154 --> 01:56.157
Charlie:
So, uh, what happens now?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.161
You tell me where you are.

02:01.454 --> 02:05.625
I mean, you might as well
tell me where you are.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.128
'Cause there's is not
a corner in this country

02:08.169 --> 02:09.796
small enough
for you to hide in.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.299
There's no off the grid

02:13.341 --> 02:16.720
that's off-the-grid enough
for you to hide from me.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.139
I'm a tough old bastard
and I got some years left.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.265
(door opens)

02:20.306 --> 02:22.183
And I'm gonna
spend them finding you.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.687
And I'm going to hit you
where it hurts.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.274
And when I
do kill you, finally...

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
you can thank me.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.613
Now...

02:36.781 --> 02:37.907
tell me, kid...

02:40.785 --> 02:42.287
am I lyin'?

02:44.330 --> 02:45.665
Charlie:
I got to go.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.335
(line disconnects)

02:51.713 --> 02:54.049
This is your job now.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.051
You're going to find
Charlie Cale,

02:56.092 --> 02:57.886
and then
you're gonna call me

02:59.220 --> 03:01.264
and you're gonna ask me

03:01.306 --> 03:03.475
how deep to dig the hole.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.114
Cliff:
Well, that was quick.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.158
ATM ping off highway 93.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.534
On my way.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.286
We got her.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.746
I found her.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.040
Yeah, she's headed west.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.291
LA.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.211
(whimsical jazz playing)

03:31.252 --> 03:33.797
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean "Texas"?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.508
Yes. I asked him.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.218
Don't you think
I asked him that?

03:38.259 --> 03:39.594
Sterling Sr.: (over phone)
Goddammit.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.766
(phone buzzing)

03:51.231 --> 03:54.609
* *

03:55.985 --> 03:57.612
Yeah, a week ago.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.281
-No, she's gone.
-Sterling Sr.: Dammit.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.243
Well, that's a good question.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.744
Allow me
to introduce myself.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.454
-My name is...
-(explosion booms)

04:06.496 --> 04:08.373
Man: (on TV)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:08.415 --> 04:10.083
Michael: (on TV) And I'm
from the department of...

04:10.125 --> 04:11.209
(explosion booms)

04:11.251 --> 04:12.585
Cliff:
A year.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.213
Over a year.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.340
Over a year
of shitty coffee

04:17.382 --> 04:18.508
and bad motels.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.468
The things
that I have eaten.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.556
A solid year on the road.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.266
I did not sign up for this.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.268
I should be there with you
running our business,

04:28.309 --> 04:29.686
doing my job.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.063
Not out here chasing
some delinquent runaway.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
Sterling Sr.: (over phone)
I thought
I made it clear to you.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.859
This is your job.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.402
And all you're telling me
right now

04:37.444 --> 04:39.779
is that you're bad
at your job.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.698
Not sure why you'd
even go out of your way

04:41.740 --> 04:44.034
to point that out
to your employer.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.035
Call you back.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.163
Yeah. Parker.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.623
Parker:
Hey, we got something
in Colorado.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.042
Your troubles may be over.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.839
(music ends)

04:59.632 --> 05:01.593
Let me take a look
at that Jane Doe.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.889
It's over. We got her.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.809
All I need to know is
how deep to dig the hole.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.937
Sterling Sr.:
We're gonna
let her heal up.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.690
Cliff: Well, that,
that might take some time.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.692
Like, like multiple months.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.028
She's conscious,
just incapacitated.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.571
I can make it hurt
right now.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.323
Sterling Sr.:
No. Two months is fine.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.866
I can wait.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.326
I want her on her feet.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.328
Then you're gonna
bring her to me.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.455
You camp out
outside that hospital

05:30.497 --> 05:31.831
until she's discharged.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.416
And don't let her
slip past you again.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.543
Are you,
are you fucking kidding me?

05:35.585 --> 05:37.587
If you think I'm sitting
at some shit motel

05:37.629 --> 05:38.755
in fucking Denver--

05:40.340 --> 05:41.841
Michael: (on TV)
Jimmy, what are you doing?

05:41.883 --> 05:44.260
Motherfucker.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.303
Now the people
who did this are putting

05:45.345 --> 05:46.596
the screws to me too.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.765
I don't wanna be here
any more than you do.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.975
If you can be good,
you get to ride up front.

05:54.437 --> 05:58.692
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

05:58.733 --> 06:00.485
Jacob!

06:00.527 --> 06:02.487
You take care
of yourself, man, alright?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.447
Thanks.
Good luck.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.826
Janelle, I'm going
to miss you, lady.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.495
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye, honey. Thanks.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.539
Edwin, It's been real,

06:12.580 --> 06:15.458
but I'm afraid
it's checkout time.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.669
I'm going to give you guys
five stars on Yelp,

06:17.711 --> 06:19.212
no doubt.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.382
So, uh, bill-wise,

06:22.424 --> 06:23.967
I'm not sure
how this works.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.678
If you have an installment plan
or something.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.055
Uh, your bill's been paid
since day one.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.474
My God.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.268
Thanks, Obama.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.729
What? No.
By private party.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.647
You've been here
two months.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.066
You had a room
with a TV.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.860
How do you think this works?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.821
I don't know, I guess I thought
you guys were like a, a church

06:44.863 --> 06:46.740
you know,
can't turn people away.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.575
Ha, ha.

06:48.616 --> 06:53.288
Wait, a... private party.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.582
(Sammy Turner's
"Lavender Blue" playing)

07:01.171 --> 07:07.135
* Lavender blue *

07:07.177 --> 07:10.096
* Dilly-dilly *

07:10.138 --> 07:12.098
* Lavender... *

07:12.140 --> 07:13.975
Trunk or the cab?

07:14.017 --> 07:15.393
Either way works for me.

07:15.435 --> 07:20.106
* If I were king *

07:20.148 --> 07:22.233
* Dilly-dilly *

07:22.275 --> 07:23.735
(thumping)

07:23.777 --> 07:25.445
Charlie:
Hey! Okay.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.739
* *

07:30.492 --> 07:32.077
Well...

07:32.118 --> 07:35.538
* Dilly-dilly *

07:35.580 --> 07:41.127
* You'll be my queen *

07:41.169 --> 07:43.254
* Lavender blue *

07:43.296 --> 07:45.507
Man: (on TV)
Drop it and show me
your hands.

07:45.548 --> 07:49.010
* Dilly-dilly *

07:50.345 --> 07:51.721
You think he's going
to make it hurt?

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015
One can hope.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.476
Yeah.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.770
It's a relief
in a sick way.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.980
I can feel the muscles
in my brain relaxing

08:01.022 --> 08:02.857
that haven't been relaxed
in a year.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.487
All this,
everywhere I went,

08:07.529 --> 08:09.572
it felt like
I was leasing time.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.325
Yeah.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.119
I know he'd
get me eventually.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.955
Inevitable.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.541
The hook.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.335
-Eh?
-The hook.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.130
Brings you back.
Inevitable.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.048
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.970
You killed Natalie, right?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.556
Like, Sterling Jr.
gave the word, but...

08:35.390 --> 08:36.808
you killed her, right?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.074
Open the glove compartment.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.756
Reach in
and take it out.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.357
(gun clatters)

10:13.029 --> 10:15.073
(engine revving)

10:15.115 --> 10:16.908
(bird cawing)

10:22.330 --> 10:23.873
Suck it in.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.626
Suck it in,
suck it in.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.838
If you're Rin Tin Tin
or Anne Boleyn.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.841
Make a desperate move
or else he'll win.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.802
And then begin to see

10:35.844 --> 10:37.470
what you're doing to me.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.681
This MTV is not for free.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.266
It's so PC
it's killing me.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.643
So, desperately,
I'll sing to thee of love.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.438
Sure, but also rage
and hate and pain

10:46.479 --> 10:48.106
and fear of self.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.108
And I can't keep
these feelings to myself.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.652
I've tried.
Well, no, in fact, I lied.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.821
Could be financial suicide

10:54.863 --> 10:56.406
but I've got
too much pride inside

10:56.448 --> 10:58.408
to hide or slide.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.869
I'll do as I'll decide
and let it ride until I've died.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.495
And only then shall I
abide this tide

11:02.537 --> 11:05.498
of catchy little tunes.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.042
Of hip
three-minute ditties.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.460
I want to bust
all your balloons.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.837
I want to burn all of
your cities to the ground.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.173
I've found I will not mess
around unless I play.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.383
Then, hey,
I will go on all day.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.968
Hear what I say.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.678
I have a prayer
to pray.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.764
That's really
all this was.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.932
When I'm feeling stuck
and need a buck,

11:22.974 --> 11:24.559
I don't rely on luck.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.644
Because the hook

11:26.686 --> 11:29.105
brings you back.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.777
You really are
the fucking worst.

11:41.868 --> 11:46.748
(bright big band music plays)

11:46.790 --> 11:48.333
Hey, w-w-what is this?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.418
Like, when Pesci gets
whacked in "Goodfellas"?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.171
Is that the, uh,
just keep walking?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.422
(lock clicks)

11:57.550 --> 11:58.635
Fuck, man.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
Get cleaned up.
Put that on.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.432
I'll be back in an hour.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.270
(door closes)

12:14.693 --> 12:15.985
Okay. Alright.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.996
(slot machines chiming)

12:36.589 --> 12:39.592
* *

12:46.808 --> 12:47.767
Hey, kid.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.692
Want a drink?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.486
No. Uh...

13:02.824 --> 13:03.825
Yeah.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.577
A beer.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.916
(scoffs)

13:15.795 --> 13:17.464
Charlie: Alright.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.466
You got me.
What happens?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.720
Tell me about your year.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.889
No. No.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.932
My year's been a knot
in my stomach every night,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.225
knowing this was coming.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.519
So now it's here.
Just do me the dignity.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.021
You won.
Just do me the dignity

13:33.063 --> 13:34.814
of skipping this
cat-and-mouse shit

13:34.856 --> 13:36.608
and whatever
you're gonna do, just do it.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.819
What did you think
was gonna happen?

13:41.654 --> 13:44.115
Now, I just want
to talk, huh?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.701
Hey, take the win, kid.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.788
Thanks.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.249
You grew up
in Atlantic City, right?

13:53.291 --> 13:54.876
You got family here,
right?

13:57.170 --> 13:59.464
Hey, I didn't mean that
to be threatening.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.383
I just, you know,

14:01.424 --> 14:03.510
I know so little about you,
I heard that,

14:03.551 --> 14:05.345
I thought
it was interesting.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.305
Yeah.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.890
Fuck it. Doesn't matter.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.477
This casino is owned

14:12.519 --> 14:15.105
by the Hasp family.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.483
Beatrix Hasp,
real piece of work.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.985
Not very nice people.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.405
You can feel it
comin' up from the floor.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.949
I can, sittin' at the tables,
I can feel it.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.035
It's funny

14:29.077 --> 14:31.663
how it seeps all the way
down through the bedrock.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.125
(sighs)

14:35.166 --> 14:36.376
And even still...

14:38.086 --> 14:41.131
there's no place
I would rather be
than a casino floor.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.718
I tried retiring.

14:44.759 --> 14:45.969
I tried golf.

14:47.846 --> 14:50.015
It's fine.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.726
I just kept getting
pulled back, you know.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.437
There's nothing
that pulls you in more

14:55.478 --> 14:56.855
than being really good

14:56.896 --> 14:59.149
at something
for unhealthy reasons.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.651
Running a casino,

15:02.694 --> 15:04.529
that's what does it for me.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.032
I'm very good at it.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.201
For the exact same reasons
I'm lousy at being a father.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.161
How about that?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.581
Any of this making
any sense to you?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.459
I didn't kill your son.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.419
And I want you to know

15:19.461 --> 15:21.546
what he did

15:21.588 --> 15:24.049
and what Kazimir Caine did

15:24.090 --> 15:25.383
and why I did what I--

15:25.425 --> 15:27.385
-I know.
-You know?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.095
I know.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.180
And I understand.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.806
I would have done
the same thing.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.351
I don't blame you
for my son's death.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.518
Well, what?

15:35.560 --> 15:36.936
Sterling, what the fuck

15:36.978 --> 15:38.480
have we been doing
for this past year?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.231
-I've been chasing you.
-Why?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.441
Because you've been runnin'.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.901
I was running
because you were chasing me.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.236
What the fuck
is even happening right now?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.613
And now I caught you.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.198
Yes.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.117
And now... what?

15:54.913 --> 15:57.999
If I stood up
and walked away right now,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.167
so what happens?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.419
Go ahead.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.254
Your car's cleaned up
and serviced.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.633
Hey, it's in
the west valet. Here.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.219
I don't think
you will though.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.763
I'm not gonna hurt you.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.099
And you know
I'm not lying.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.308
But I think you're curious

16:15.350 --> 16:17.143
why I got you here.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.498
(Charlie sighs)

16:38.540 --> 16:40.208
I know
I had you hooked.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.215
Sterling Jr.:
Can you do your thing
over video?

16:47.257 --> 16:48.466
Charlie:
Yeah, I think so.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.592
And so when is this game?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.052
Sterling Jr.:
Day after tomorrow.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.220
We got 48 hours.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.431
Charlie: Uh, and,
and your dad's alright

16:54.472 --> 16:57.225
with this, uh,
us plucking his golden goose?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.768
Sterling Jr.:
My dad?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.814
You recognize that?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.649
I've had the whole place
tapped for sound

17:04.691 --> 17:06.067
since the early '80s.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.569
Yeah, evidently.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.571
In tape I trust.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.656
-(tape rewinding)
-But there's this.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.366
This happened
right before

17:13.408 --> 17:14.951
your meeting
with my son.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.164
He's in his office
all by himself. Right?

17:19.205 --> 17:20.915
His private line rings.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.669
(phone rings)

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
Sterling Jr.:
Not here.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.300
-"Not here."
-Sterling Sr.: "Not here."

17:30.342 --> 17:32.093
Meaning,
don't call me here.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.887
Because he knew
I could trace the number,

17:33.928 --> 17:35.680
which I did.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.016
It came from the owner
of this casino,

17:38.058 --> 17:39.642
Beatrix Hasp.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.353
There's three things
I said to my kid

17:41.394 --> 17:43.313
before I gave him
the keys to the casino.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.440
First two don't matter.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.691
The third one...

17:48.068 --> 17:49.944
keep Beatrix Hasp out.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.863
She's the head
of the Five Families,

17:51.905 --> 17:54.032
which is exactly
what it sounds like.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.077
They've wanted a piece
of Frost Nevada forever.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.912
I keep 'em out.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.747
They're not happy
about this.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.791
My son...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.794
he was making
a deal with Beatrix

18:05.835 --> 18:07.253
and the Five Families

18:07.295 --> 18:08.963
behind my back.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.049
Okay.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.050
Sterling Sr.:
Today, there's a sit-down

18:12.092 --> 18:14.719
between me
and the Five Families.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.264
That's why I'm here.
At her hotel.

18:18.306 --> 18:21.059
Cliff didn't like the idea
of doing it on her turf.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.268
It's stupid.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.728
Sterling Sr.:
She hurts me,
she starts a war

18:23.770 --> 18:25.980
with the Southwest Syndicate.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.733
I'm hoping
she's not that crazy.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.610
And I'm hoping you're not
bad enough at your job

18:30.652 --> 18:32.612
to lose two Sterlings
in a row.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.740
I'm gettin'
an inkling here.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.575
Sterling Sr.:
At the sit-down,

18:37.617 --> 18:40.286
I will be promised
certain protections.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.081
Assurances will be made
and tensions will be voiced,

18:43.123 --> 18:46.626
and many, many,
many, many lies will be told.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.297
It'd be a good idea for you
to be in that room.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.135
Wow.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.554
All this,

18:57.595 --> 18:59.556
the healing up,
the Dolce,

18:59.597 --> 19:01.558
even the finding me,

19:01.599 --> 19:04.144
it's all that for a job.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.397
$500,000 clean cash,
which I hope you will regard

19:07.439 --> 19:11.276
as the beginning of a mutually
beneficial relationship.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.153
And if you don't...

19:13.194 --> 19:15.947
no obligations
beyond this afternoon.

19:15.989 --> 19:16.990
Deja vu.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.086
Say it again.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.047
About the money
and how I can walk.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.966
"In tape I trust."

19:37.677 --> 19:40.221
500K for the afternoon.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.849
After that, you're free.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.146
Welcome back to the world,
Charlie Cale.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.189
Oh shit.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.648
Sterling Sr.:
And, uh, by the way,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.692
I hope you don't think
I'm too sentimental.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.361
Here you go.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.199
Open it.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.701
Okay.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.006
Reach in. Go on.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.049
(chuckles)

20:24.974 --> 20:26.768
From me to you, kid.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.657
(electricity crackles)

20:40.699 --> 20:42.200
-(gunshots)
-(Sterling Sr. grunts)

20:42.242 --> 20:43.201
(body thuds)

20:43.243 --> 20:46.162
(people screaming)

20:46.204 --> 20:49.207
(sirens wailing)

20:50.250 --> 20:51.459
Oh fuck.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.420
Security!

20:53.461 --> 20:55.213
Security,
stop that girl!

20:55.255 --> 20:56.381
She killed him.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.142
When you follow
somebody's orders

21:07.183 --> 21:08.518
for 25 years,

21:08.560 --> 21:10.812
stand behind them
and nod,

21:10.854 --> 21:15.025
advance when they advance,
the man behind the man.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.193
When you do that, there's
a very natural impression

21:17.235 --> 21:19.904
to be had
that you like the person.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.157
Even love the person.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.784
I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with dogs.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.120
Hmm...

21:28.121 --> 21:30.457
When that's reflected
back on you

21:30.498 --> 21:32.959
by everyone who sees you
as the man's best friend,

21:33.001 --> 21:34.919
I guess it can go
two ways.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.797
It can hook you,
pull you in,

21:37.839 --> 21:40.550
make you start to feel
something like love or...

21:42.635 --> 21:44.095
or it can go
the other way.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.099
Start to metastasize.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.310
And all the disrespect
and lack of regard

21:50.352 --> 21:52.270
and all the ways
you're treated like a dog

21:52.312 --> 21:55.148
that seem to bounce off
the obedient facade,

21:55.190 --> 21:56.232
no.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.193
No, no, no.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.987
It all goes somewhere.

22:01.780 --> 22:02.947
Right here.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.076
I hate the old man.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.288
I want a yacht

22:11.331 --> 22:13.208
in addition.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.001
Woman: (over phone)
Alright.
We can get you a yacht.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.213
Well, the terms
you've laid out proffer me

22:18.254 --> 22:20.006
more dignity and respect
than I've gotten

22:20.048 --> 22:21.508
in decades
from the Sterlings,

22:21.549 --> 22:24.010
so I am saying yes.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.012
Just tell me how deep
to dig the hole.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.640
Woman:
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is all good to hear,

22:28.682 --> 22:30.183
but it won't be that simple.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.976
If any connection
comes to light

22:32.018 --> 22:33.645
between us and his death,

22:33.687 --> 22:34.688
it's not good.

22:34.729 --> 22:35.647
It's war.

22:35.689 --> 22:38.024
And yeesh, war.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.818
So you want it
to look like an accident?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.319
Beatrix:
Well, even that.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.988
With the timing,
people will be suspicious.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.700
Nope. The best thing,
the ideal thing,

22:46.741 --> 22:48.201
we get a patsy.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.328
Someone with
a believable motive

22:50.370 --> 22:52.706
that we can set up
in an ironclad way

22:52.747 --> 22:54.332
to take the fall.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.878
(laughing)

22:59.921 --> 23:01.589
Woman:
What's so goddamn funny?

23:04.050 --> 23:08.888
* Ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe *

23:08.930 --> 23:14.185
* It don't matter anyhow *

23:14.227 --> 23:17.981
* There ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe *

23:19.399 --> 23:23.945
* That is if you don't know
by now *

23:23.987 --> 23:26.823
* When the rooster crows *

23:26.865 --> 23:29.075
* At the break of dawn *

23:30.201 --> 23:32.787
* Look out your window *

23:32.829 --> 23:34.414
* And I'll be gone *

23:35.290 --> 23:37.042
* And you are the reason *

23:37.083 --> 23:40.045
* That I'm a-travelin' on *

23:40.086 --> 23:43.798
* Don't think twice
it's alright *

23:43.840 --> 23:45.383
Cliff:
Alright.

23:46.384 --> 23:47.510
She's here.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.179
Good.

23:50.055 --> 23:51.348
How's she look?

23:51.973 --> 23:53.183
Healed up?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.019
Yeah.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.444
(Sterling Sr. sighs)

24:08.114 --> 24:10.158
Next to the chair.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.493
I want to surprise her
with it.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.703
Everything else all set?

24:14.621 --> 24:16.748
Nearly.

24:16.790 --> 24:20.543
* I'm walking down that long,
lonesome road, babe *

24:21.628 --> 24:23.755
* Where I'm bound *

24:23.797 --> 24:25.131
* I can't tell *

24:26.466 --> 24:30.512
* But goodbye,
that's too good a word, gal *

24:32.180 --> 24:35.475
* So I'm just gonna say
"fare thee well" *

24:36.810 --> 24:41.106
* I ain't saying
that you treated me unkind *

24:42.399 --> 24:44.609
* You could have done better *

24:44.651 --> 24:45.985
* But I don't mind *

24:47.362 --> 24:49.197
* You just kind of wasted
some of my *

24:49.239 --> 24:50.573
-(knocking on door)
-* Precious time *

24:50.615 --> 24:52.367
Man:
Room service.

24:52.409 --> 24:55.120
* Don't think twice
it's alright *

24:56.830 --> 25:02.293
* Ain't no use in calling out
my name, gal *

25:02.335 --> 25:06.631
* Like you never did before *

25:06.673 --> 25:12.470
* No, there ain't no use
in calling out my name, gal *

25:12.512 --> 25:16.141
* Because I can't
hear you anymore *

25:17.183 --> 25:19.144
* I'm a-thinking
and a-wonderin' *

25:19.185 --> 25:21.646
* All the way
down the road *

25:21.688 --> 25:24.274
* I once loved a woman *

25:24.315 --> 25:27.152
* A child I'm told *

25:27.193 --> 25:29.237
* I gave her my heart *

25:29.904 --> 25:31.156
Open it.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.368
* Don't think twice
it's alright *

25:36.911 --> 25:40.248
* I'm walking down that
long, lonesome road, babe *

25:40.290 --> 25:42.751
Sterling Sr.:
Go ahead, reach in.
Go ahead.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.711
Reach in. Go on.

25:44.753 --> 25:47.172
From me to you, kid.

25:47.213 --> 25:51.051
* But goodbye,
that's too good a word, gal *

25:52.635 --> 25:55.555
* I'm just going to say
"fare thee well" *

26:01.603 --> 26:02.896
-(gunshots)
-(Sterling Sr. grunts)

26:02.937 --> 26:04.689
-(body thuds)
-(people murmuring)

26:07.567 --> 26:08.735
Oh fuck.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.362
Security!

26:10.403 --> 26:11.488
Stop her!

26:15.742 --> 26:17.118
She killed him.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.703
She killed him.
Security!

26:18.745 --> 26:22.248
(dramatic music plays)

26:27.170 --> 26:28.672
(phone ringing)

26:34.135 --> 26:35.261
Who's this?

26:36.513 --> 26:37.555
No, wrong number.

26:40.517 --> 26:44.020
(phone buzzing)

26:44.896 --> 26:46.690
Yeah? No.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.405
(phone ringing)

26:54.364 --> 26:55.407
Yeah.

26:56.366 --> 26:57.409
What?

26:58.535 --> 26:59.577
No.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.623
(ringing)

27:09.087 --> 27:10.255
This is Agent Clark.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.381
Charlie:
Oh, thank God.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.341
I knew that
the last number had,

27:13.383 --> 27:14.884
like, a round part in it.

27:14.926 --> 27:16.052
I just couldn't--

27:16.094 --> 27:17.721
Hey, it's Charlie Cale,

27:17.762 --> 27:18.805
from Joyce and Irene.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.849
You, uh,
you gave me a card.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.350
-Uh, Luca, right?
-Yeah.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.060
-Sugar nephew.
-Charlie.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.145
Charlie:
Okay, so I'm not sure
where to begin

27:25.186 --> 27:26.521
to explain this,
but, uh...

27:26.563 --> 27:28.523
Okay, so since
we last parlayed,

27:28.565 --> 27:30.817
I find myself
in a, a very, um,

27:30.859 --> 27:32.694
let's say,
specific situation.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.195
I know. Charlie,
here's how I can help you.

27:34.237 --> 27:36.156
Turn yourself in
to the authorities
right now.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.835
(phone buzzing)

27:48.877 --> 27:50.754
Don't turn yourself in.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.589
Yeah, I wasn't
planning on it.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.049
-Where are you?
-Uh,

27:54.090 --> 27:55.550
well, I'm in Atlantic City.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.511
I'm not sure if, you know,
you saw it on the news

27:58.553 --> 28:02.223
or if you get some sort
of special FBI wire services.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.225
But, yeah,
I'm in a very bad situation.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.728
I know, I know. Where do
you think I am right now?

28:06.770 --> 28:08.104
Charlie:
You're here?

28:08.563 --> 28:09.731
Shit.

28:09.773 --> 28:11.191
The FBI is here?

28:11.232 --> 28:13.943
This is the Franz Ferdinand
of mob hits.

28:13.985 --> 28:16.905
The bureau has the case,
and I'm lead man.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.615
God, man, no offense,
but I thought

28:18.656 --> 28:20.825
you were low-level,
like Uber for stoolies.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.620
Well, yeah,
I got a promotion,
and I owe you for that.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.413
I tracked down
that email you sent,

28:25.455 --> 28:26.831
and we got Kazimir Caine.

28:26.873 --> 28:29.334
That was kind of
a big deal.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.251
Huh!

28:30.293 --> 28:32.629
You got him? Yes!

28:32.671 --> 28:34.714
Oh man, I didn't see that
on the news.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.840
No, you didn't.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.801
Look, y-y-you said
you're lead man, right?

28:37.842 --> 28:39.094
You're lead man,
you can help me

28:39.135 --> 28:40.804
because you know
I didn't do this, alright.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.431
I was set up,
so you can get me out of this.

28:43.473 --> 28:46.393
Uh, I don't know that.
No, there's video.

28:46.434 --> 28:49.354
There's a lot of video,
all the security cameras,
of you

28:49.396 --> 28:51.356
pulling a gun on Sterling.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.234
Then the power goes out.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.903
He's dead. Shot with
the same gun you pulled.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.489
Look,

28:59.531 --> 29:00.615
I did not know

29:00.657 --> 29:02.909
what I was pulling
out of that box

29:02.951 --> 29:04.452
until it was in my hand.

29:04.494 --> 29:07.163
Then the lights went on
and he was dead.

29:07.205 --> 29:09.207
But I did not fire
that gun.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.875
It had been fired twice.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.628
Ballistics, fingerprints,
everything. It's there.

29:13.670 --> 29:14.796
I, uh--

29:14.838 --> 29:18.466
It's just been-- How?
Like, fuck. Okay?

29:18.508 --> 29:19.801
Just how?

29:19.843 --> 29:21.094
Where are you right now?

29:21.136 --> 29:22.637
I'm, I'm in
some random room.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.681
I, uh, I lost Cliff
in the crowd,

29:24.723 --> 29:26.182
and then I, uh,

29:26.224 --> 29:28.351
I hid out in the interfaith
prayer room for a few hours.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.645
And then I swiped a key
from the housekeeping station

29:30.687 --> 29:32.147
'cause they keep the cards
in the carts

29:32.188 --> 29:34.149
and, yeah,
I got in here.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.859
Wait, you're still
in the hotel.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.068
Yeah, but they
turn it over

29:37.110 --> 29:38.403
in, like, I don't know,
20 minutes,

29:38.445 --> 29:39.988
so I got to make
a move here.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.573
Get out of the hotel!

29:43.158 --> 29:44.367
Okay, my car is in
the west valet.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.744
if I can get there.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.245
Can I get there?
What's the situation?

29:47.287 --> 29:49.372
Do not, don't get your car.
Are you nuts?

29:49.414 --> 29:50.540
The bridges all have
checkpoints.

29:50.582 --> 29:51.750
The whole island's
shut down.

29:51.791 --> 29:52.959
Don't get your car.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.127
Okay. I'm coming
to you then.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.462
You're in the casino.
I'm comin' to you.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.380
No. No, no, no,
no, no.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.049
I come to you, we figure
this out together, alright?

29:59.090 --> 30:01.176
We solve this.
I'm surprisingly good
at this shit.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.260
Charlie, no.
Charlie, listen--

30:02.302 --> 30:03.428
-Listen to me.
-We solve this together.

30:03.470 --> 30:04.888
-Listen--
-Because I didn't do this.

30:04.929 --> 30:07.057
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if you did it.

30:07.098 --> 30:08.224
It doesn't matter
if you solve it.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.517
The truth does not matter.

30:09.559 --> 30:11.644
If Beatrix Hasp
and the Five Families

30:11.686 --> 30:13.313
killed Sterling
and set you up,

30:13.355 --> 30:15.357
then your goal,
your only one goal,

30:15.398 --> 30:17.233
is to get off
this island alive.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.403
Between you, me,
and a burner phone

30:20.445 --> 30:23.073
if you turn yourself in,
I can't promise you that.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.366
Do you know anyone
in the city?

30:24.407 --> 30:25.742
Can you get someplace safe?

30:27.744 --> 30:28.828
Uh, yeah.

30:30.580 --> 30:31.539
Maybe.

30:32.707 --> 30:33.750
(sighs)

30:39.881 --> 30:41.716
Man: (over radio)
We're looking
for a blond woman,

30:41.758 --> 30:42.759
floral sequin dress.

30:43.635 --> 30:46.388
(women shouting)

30:46.429 --> 30:49.641
(laughing, shouting)

31:03.655 --> 31:05.615
Man: (on radio)
Lobby all clear. Over.

31:09.452 --> 31:13.456
(party music playing)

32:06.551 --> 32:09.512
(muffled party music)

32:14.434 --> 32:15.977
Charlie:
Jesus Christ.

32:21.858 --> 32:22.984
No.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.780
Come on.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.075
Oh, come on.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.701
Jesus!

32:32.243 --> 32:33.453
Ugh!

32:35.830 --> 32:37.665
Uh, I'm safe.
I'm, yeah, I'm good.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.918
Uh, so give me news.
Are things cooling off?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.920
-Luca: Very much not. No.
-Shit.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.297
Luca:
The Southwest Syndicate
is getting on war footing.

32:44.339 --> 32:47.092
They think Beatrix
and the Five Families
hit Sterling.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.135
Which, yes, she did,
is what I said.

32:49.177 --> 32:50.804
Luca:
But if she gets you
brought in for it,

32:50.845 --> 32:52.514
they can sew it all up.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.973
They need to catch you.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.017
Oh, I-I-I remembered something.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.102
Th-th-the tape.

32:57.143 --> 33:00.689
I had the tape recording
on the table.

33:00.730 --> 33:02.357
So, you know,
maybe there's something.

33:02.399 --> 33:04.401
maybe you can tell
how far away

33:04.442 --> 33:05.819
the shots were from,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.654
from how blown out it is
on the recording.

33:07.696 --> 33:09.572
Luca:
No, I've been back
and forth over that tape

33:09.614 --> 33:11.658
like Gene Hackman,
and it's all consistent.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.159
-Hey! Alright.
-Luca: The shots are blown out.

33:13.201 --> 33:15.328
It's a cheap recorder.
There's nothing

33:15.370 --> 33:16.663
No, no, no,
the other side.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.581
The, the,
turn the tape over.

33:18.623 --> 33:19.874
Okay.
Listen to the other side.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.835
Sterling's son gets
a call from Beatrix

33:21.876 --> 33:23.503
that proves the, uh...

33:23.545 --> 33:24.879
Luca:
Proves what?

33:24.921 --> 33:26.589
Shit, it doesn't
prove anything.

33:26.631 --> 33:28.049
Luca:
I'll listen to it anyway.

33:28.091 --> 33:29.009
But, Charlie,

33:29.050 --> 33:31.219
get out of town
any way you can.

33:31.261 --> 33:32.470
I, uh...

33:32.512 --> 33:35.015
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

33:35.056 --> 33:37.308
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

33:49.487 --> 33:50.739
Jesus...

33:53.700 --> 33:56.202
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

34:09.549 --> 34:11.259
There's a woman
in the yard.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.469
There's a what, baby?

34:12.510 --> 34:14.804
A woman in the yard
crawling under the house.

34:14.846 --> 34:17.140
I think she's going in
the secret way.

34:26.816 --> 34:28.068
Charlie:
Oh.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.820
Hey, Em,
how you been?

34:30.862 --> 34:33.031
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

34:33.823 --> 34:36.076
No, I'm serious.

34:36.117 --> 34:39.371
Go easy. I just did
a lot of crawling.

34:39.412 --> 34:41.122
Cops. Cops at my door

34:41.164 --> 34:43.375
outside right now,
on a Sunday.

34:43.416 --> 34:46.795
I got to explain
to my little girl the cops.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.755
What are you wearing?

34:48.797 --> 34:51.049
No. You know what?
I don't even want to know.

34:51.091 --> 34:53.134
You know, I got
to explain to Shasta.

34:53.176 --> 34:55.929
"Oh, that, that hooker
crawling under the house,

34:55.970 --> 34:57.180
"that's your Auntie Charlie,

34:57.222 --> 35:00.016
who you met once
when you were three."

35:00.058 --> 35:02.435
It's great to see you.
Just great.

35:02.477 --> 35:06.773
Jesus. Look, Em, do you have
any olive oil or something?

35:06.815 --> 35:08.983
-What?
-I just need it for just...

35:10.694 --> 35:12.987
Weird.
Uh, never mind.

35:13.029 --> 35:15.115
You know, I ought a march you
out to the cops right now?

35:15.156 --> 35:16.741
-Don't, please. Don't, please.
-Yeah. Yeah.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.451
I'll regret it the rest
of my life if I don't.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.286
Look, I, I, you know
I don't want to come
here like this. Okay.

35:20.328 --> 35:22.539
The last thing in the world
I want to do is
come to you like this.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.833
Alright? You know that. Alright?
So just, I just need one thing.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.544
-Oh, you need one thing. God!
-I need one thing!

35:27.585 --> 35:29.045
One thing,
and then I'll go.

35:29.087 --> 35:31.006
-Why do I always get
pulled into shit with you?
-Dude.

35:31.047 --> 35:34.217
Saving you when
you're just ruinous.

35:35.802 --> 35:37.929
You are ruinous.

35:45.854 --> 35:49.232
Jesus. Em. Em.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.818
-Just--
-Would you keep it down,
please. She's...

35:51.860 --> 35:53.611
I'm sorry.

35:53.653 --> 35:56.865
Look, I want to know, uh...

35:57.657 --> 35:58.908
did you, uh...

35:59.868 --> 36:01.494
I sent you...

36:01.536 --> 36:04.164
A couple of years back,
I, uh, sent you, uh...

36:04.205 --> 36:05.206
The money?

36:06.708 --> 36:08.043
So what do you want now?

36:08.084 --> 36:10.545
Me to thank you
for the money?

36:10.587 --> 36:12.505
-I--
-Or that's what you need?

36:12.547 --> 36:13.757
You need money?

36:13.798 --> 36:15.467
No, no.
(stammers)

36:15.508 --> 36:17.510
Look, I just wanted,
I didn't know if you got it.

36:17.552 --> 36:18.887
I just wanted to know

36:19.554 --> 36:20.555
that you did...

36:21.681 --> 36:22.891
get it.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.646
Alright, look, I, uh,

36:29.898 --> 36:31.399
I can be gone
in two minutes.

36:33.568 --> 36:35.403
I just,
I need Dad's boat.

36:35.445 --> 36:36.905
(scoffs)

36:45.330 --> 36:48.500
(clattering)

36:48.541 --> 36:49.584
Em.

36:50.919 --> 36:52.879
Thanks.
Thank you.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.255
You're fuckin' welcome.

36:55.382 --> 36:56.841
Jesus.

36:56.883 --> 36:58.259
I'll wait over there.

37:01.721 --> 37:06.184
(TV playing, indistinct)

37:08.895 --> 37:09.979
Hello.

37:10.605 --> 37:12.273
Hello.

37:12.315 --> 37:16.069
I'm Charlie. I'm, uh,
I'm your mom's sister.

37:16.111 --> 37:18.738
So that makes me
your aunt.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.532
You swim?

37:20.573 --> 37:21.449
Do I swim?

37:22.909 --> 37:25.245
I haven't swam in years.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.955
Why? Do I look
like I swim?

37:28.289 --> 37:29.249
I, uh...

37:30.333 --> 37:31.459
Okay.

37:34.462 --> 37:36.589
And who didn't believe
I could do it?

37:37.799 --> 37:38.717
Who doubted me?

37:43.346 --> 37:44.556
Well, hello.

37:45.348 --> 37:46.307
That's, uh...

37:47.684 --> 37:49.436
yeah, that's me
and your mom.

37:49.477 --> 37:51.146
(scoffs) Yeah.

37:51.187 --> 37:55.275
Well, uh, Dad,
I'm sorry,

37:55.316 --> 37:58.403
Granddad used to take us
out on his boat,

37:58.445 --> 38:02.532
and then he'd make us
swim back to shore, so...

38:03.575 --> 38:04.826
That was fun.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.369
I like swimming.

38:06.411 --> 38:08.038
Charlie:
Ah, you do?
That's good.

38:08.079 --> 38:09.956
Yeah, I hate it.

38:09.998 --> 38:12.250
Then why'd you do it?

38:12.292 --> 38:16.796
Well, I guess I was good
at it for some reason and...

38:16.838 --> 38:18.465
You know, you end up
in the water,

38:18.506 --> 38:20.258
what else are you going
to do? Right?

38:22.093 --> 38:24.137
Emily:
Shasta.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.806
Auntie Charlie
was just saying goodbye.

38:26.848 --> 38:28.224
You say goodbye to her?

38:29.893 --> 38:31.102
Goodbye.

38:31.644 --> 38:32.687
Bye-bye.

38:32.729 --> 38:35.607
Baby, what is that
in, in Jan's hair?

38:35.648 --> 38:38.818
It's a hot roller.
I'm giving her a perm.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.403
Aunt Charlie dropped it.

38:46.409 --> 38:48.828
Okay. I'm sorry
about that.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.455
It's my hair-do. It's...

38:50.497 --> 38:52.123
Yeah, okay.

38:52.165 --> 38:54.167
Shasta seems
like a good kid.

38:55.251 --> 38:58.380
I'm sorry I didn't
ever get to, uh...

38:58.421 --> 39:00.965
Well, I have a situation
I have to get out of.

39:01.007 --> 39:04.052
But after that,
if you'd allow it,

39:04.094 --> 39:06.429
you know,
I'd love to try to...

39:08.139 --> 39:09.683
I mean, we should talk
at least, right?

39:13.395 --> 39:14.396
No.

39:16.898 --> 39:18.066
No.

39:18.108 --> 39:20.777
I mean, there's a world
where we get to talk.

39:21.778 --> 39:25.031
We, we hash out
the past,

39:25.073 --> 39:26.241
talk about Dad,

39:27.200 --> 39:28.326
what you did,

39:28.993 --> 39:31.037
what you ruined

39:31.079 --> 39:33.164
with your truth
and bullshit.

39:34.374 --> 39:35.959
You learn more
about my life,

39:36.001 --> 39:38.712
my kid,
and we build that.

39:42.590 --> 39:45.802
But that's not
the life you chose.

39:45.844 --> 39:47.554
That's not
"The Charlie Show."

39:48.596 --> 39:53.059
You think I chose this,
like, doing this?

39:53.101 --> 39:54.853
You think I like
living like this?

39:54.894 --> 39:56.062
I don't know.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.898
But, I mean, "like."
What is "like"?

39:58.940 --> 40:00.942
I don't care.
I mean...

40:00.984 --> 40:03.319
Yeah.
You know what? Yeah.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.073
It's the life you got.

40:07.115 --> 40:09.743
And someday you're
gonna have to admit,

40:09.784 --> 40:11.077
you chose it.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.705
This is not just
a series of situations

40:13.747 --> 40:15.123
you keep getting
reeled into.

40:15.165 --> 40:17.167
You choose to be
out there,

40:17.208 --> 40:18.460
wherever the fuck you are,

40:18.501 --> 40:21.463
just swimming free,
cool and breezy.

40:24.299 --> 40:27.844
And I bet
people love you.

40:27.886 --> 40:32.140
And I got a lot of bile
kicking up right now, I know,

40:32.182 --> 40:35.352
but I'm not saying
they're wrong.

40:37.103 --> 40:38.396
You got a good heart.

40:39.981 --> 40:41.608
You choose to spend it
on strangers

40:41.649 --> 40:44.110
and then breeze
on down the highway.

40:44.152 --> 40:46.279
But I don't know.
Maybe that's right.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.864
You know. I mean...

40:51.284 --> 40:52.702
I bet you do some good.

40:55.163 --> 40:56.706
I bet there are a lot
of people out there

40:56.748 --> 40:58.249
who need someone
like you.

41:01.419 --> 41:02.629
But us?

41:06.007 --> 41:07.384
We're doin' just fine.

41:09.552 --> 41:10.595
(sighs)

42:00.562 --> 42:01.855
(Charlie sighs)

42:14.159 --> 42:15.326
How the fuck?

42:16.202 --> 42:17.245
What?

42:17.704 --> 42:18.997
Jesus.

42:21.207 --> 42:22.208
Augh!

42:37.098 --> 42:38.141
(sighs)

42:48.610 --> 42:50.862
(seagulls cawing)

42:57.327 --> 42:58.536
Cliff: Ah!

42:59.704 --> 43:02.999
(phone buzzing)

43:04.084 --> 43:05.085
Hello?

43:05.126 --> 43:07.128
Charlie:
Why would I kill Sterling?

43:07.170 --> 43:08.463
Where are you?

43:08.505 --> 43:09.798
You know what
he was doing?

43:09.839 --> 43:11.591
He was giving me
my life back.

43:11.633 --> 43:12.759
It makes no sense.

43:12.801 --> 43:14.678
I mean,
you can see that, right?

43:14.719 --> 43:16.596
Look, people do things.
Where are you?

43:16.638 --> 43:18.431
You heard the shots
in the dark.

43:18.473 --> 43:20.975
Did they sound like
they came from the table?

43:21.017 --> 43:22.185
I mean, Cliff, did they?

43:23.645 --> 43:25.230
No.

43:25.271 --> 43:26.398
Where are you?

43:26.439 --> 43:29.067
Look, we were set up.
You as much as me.

43:29.109 --> 43:31.236
It kills me,
but we're in this together now.

43:31.277 --> 43:33.446
You want to know
who killed the old man,

43:33.488 --> 43:34.948
we're in this together.

43:34.989 --> 43:36.074
Let me come to you.

43:36.116 --> 43:37.992
We'll figure out
what happened.

43:38.034 --> 43:39.869
Cliff, where are you?

43:40.954 --> 43:44.290
Okay, um,
I'm on a boat.

43:47.502 --> 43:48.378
You're what?

43:48.420 --> 43:50.296
State Marina? Pier 12.

43:51.589 --> 43:53.842
(phone beeping)

43:55.677 --> 43:58.138
(line ringing)

43:58.179 --> 44:00.098
Hello, Chief,
It's Cliff LeGrand.

44:00.140 --> 44:03.435
Uh, listen, I'm on my yacht,
docked down here

44:03.476 --> 44:04.769
at the end of Pier 12,

44:04.811 --> 44:08.064
and Charlie Cale is currently
on her way to me.

44:09.232 --> 44:10.150
Yeah.

44:11.234 --> 44:14.320
Yes, I can try
to keep her here. Uh-huh.

44:14.362 --> 44:15.488
You're welcome.

44:25.373 --> 44:29.210
(phone ringing)

44:30.003 --> 44:31.212
Yes, ma'am.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.173
I did. Yes.

44:35.216 --> 44:37.927
Mrs. Hasp, pleasure
doing business with you.

44:41.639 --> 44:42.932
Charlie:
Hey.

44:43.641 --> 44:44.642
Hey.

44:45.852 --> 44:47.979
That was, uh,
that was quick.

44:48.021 --> 44:50.065
Charlie:
Uh, yeah.

44:50.106 --> 44:53.068
Uh, you know,
wild coincidence.

44:53.109 --> 44:55.320
I happened
to already...

44:56.404 --> 44:58.531
Yeah, anyway, hey.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.409
Do you want
a beer?

45:02.035 --> 45:03.870
Yeah. Cool boat.

45:03.912 --> 45:05.580
The gun the police
found at the scene

45:05.622 --> 45:06.998
had your fingerprints
on it.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.291
Two shots fired.

45:08.333 --> 45:10.251
It was the gun
that shot the old man.

45:12.045 --> 45:13.546
Look, man,
all I can do

45:13.588 --> 45:14.923
is say again
what happened.

45:14.964 --> 45:16.383
I reached my hand in.

45:16.424 --> 45:18.093
I was like,
"What the hell is this?"

45:18.134 --> 45:20.387
I pulled it out,
the lights went out,

45:20.428 --> 45:21.429
and then...

45:22.639 --> 45:25.016
-Then.
-Then.

45:25.058 --> 45:27.018
Then... (scoffs)

45:27.060 --> 45:29.104
something glowed.

45:29.145 --> 45:30.897
I'd forgotten that.

45:30.939 --> 45:33.066
The chip,
the casino chip,

45:33.108 --> 45:35.777
he was, uh,
holding it.

45:35.819 --> 45:39.989
It glowed or, uh,
it started glowing like,

45:40.031 --> 45:41.866
like it turned on
or something.

45:41.908 --> 45:43.451
Does that make sense?

45:43.493 --> 45:45.912
Well, I mean, sometimes
casinos have chips that glow

45:45.954 --> 45:48.456
under black lights
for security.

45:48.498 --> 45:51.167
And with the lights out,
the shooter would have wanted
to have a target,

45:51.209 --> 45:52.585
especially if he was
trying to blend in

45:52.627 --> 45:55.880
or didn't want to get
night vision gear on or off

45:55.922 --> 45:59.050
or use a gun
with an infrared scope.

45:59.926 --> 46:01.928
Where'd he get that chip?

46:01.970 --> 46:04.264
I think it was on the table
when he sat down.

46:04.305 --> 46:06.349
He always did that
with a, with a chip.

46:06.391 --> 46:08.685
Oh shit, you're right.
He did.

46:08.727 --> 46:10.395
Yeah, I remember that.

46:10.437 --> 46:12.856
Well, gosh, anyone who knew him
would know that.

46:12.897 --> 46:15.942
I mean, Beatrix Hasp
would know that.

46:15.984 --> 46:17.652
Yes, she would.

46:19.696 --> 46:21.072
But maybe I just say
fuck it.

46:21.114 --> 46:22.657
Turn you in for it
anyway, though.

46:23.825 --> 46:25.201
(gulps)

46:25.243 --> 46:27.996
Truth and all that whatnot.
But maybe just fuck it.

46:31.124 --> 46:33.335
Yeah, I, uh...

46:34.711 --> 46:36.087
I guess I'm betting

46:36.129 --> 46:38.465
that you're even
just a little bit like me

46:38.506 --> 46:41.468
and whoever did this
for real,

46:41.509 --> 46:44.262
you want to see them
get theirs

46:44.304 --> 46:46.181
because you loved
the old man.

46:48.850 --> 46:50.310
So what do we do?

46:50.352 --> 46:52.354
Well, gee,
I don't know.

46:53.438 --> 46:54.230
We're on a boat,

46:54.272 --> 46:56.232
so I guess
for starters,

46:56.775 --> 46:58.026
we leave.

46:58.693 --> 47:01.029
(engine rumbling)

47:03.198 --> 47:04.532
What do you think?

47:05.992 --> 47:07.327
Maybe the DR.

47:08.119 --> 47:09.496
Yeah, maybe.

47:09.537 --> 47:11.581
Grab my iPad
from down below, will you?

47:11.623 --> 47:12.665
It's just down there.

47:14.376 --> 47:15.418
Alright.

47:18.630 --> 47:20.382
Okey-dokey...

47:31.976 --> 47:33.269
Alright.

48:03.258 --> 48:05.385
(boat engine stops)

48:10.807 --> 48:14.436
(sirens wailing)

48:15.770 --> 48:17.105
-(lock clicks)
-Hah.

48:17.147 --> 48:19.274
Cliff. Cliff.

48:19.315 --> 48:22.569
Hey, I found your
glow-in-the-dark things,
you son of a bitch.

48:22.610 --> 48:23.987
Cliff!
Oh, my God,

48:24.029 --> 48:26.990
I found your murder things,
your chips, you asshole.

48:27.032 --> 48:28.742
Jesus.

48:28.783 --> 48:31.536
Hey. What are the cops
going to think about that, huh?

48:31.578 --> 48:33.371
Cliff:
Put those chips
on the table

48:33.413 --> 48:35.373
against video evidence,

48:35.415 --> 48:37.208
fingerprints on the weapon.

48:37.250 --> 48:39.794
You bet a bum hand,
Charlie Cale.

48:39.836 --> 48:41.796
(laughs)
Nowhere to run.

48:43.048 --> 48:45.675
Just sit tight, Charlie.
Relax.

48:45.717 --> 48:47.594
(Cliff laughs)

48:47.635 --> 48:49.137
The fuck?

48:49.804 --> 48:51.097
Alright, man. No.

48:51.139 --> 48:53.600
Shit, shit, shit. Okay.

48:53.641 --> 48:55.018
Hey. (grunts)

48:55.060 --> 48:57.270
(panting)
Oh, fuck!

48:57.312 --> 48:58.813
Take it easy
take it easy!

49:01.983 --> 49:04.361
Ahhh!

49:07.906 --> 49:10.742
(sirens continue)

49:25.340 --> 49:26.925
Son of a bitch!

49:31.888 --> 49:34.432
Officer:
Sir, can you stay
right there for a second?

49:35.308 --> 49:37.060
Hey, she swam off.

49:37.102 --> 49:38.728
She just swam off
that way.

49:38.770 --> 49:41.064
She's got to be right off
the boat that way.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.357
-Charlie Cale.
-Cliff LeGrand,

49:42.399 --> 49:44.693
I'm FBI Special Agent
Luca Clark.

49:44.734 --> 49:47.654
Whoa. You okay?
Your eye is really fucked.

49:47.696 --> 49:49.447
No, I'm not okay,
but it doesn't matter.

49:49.489 --> 49:51.157
Charlie Cale,
the one who killed Sterling,

49:51.199 --> 49:52.409
she's getting away right there.

49:52.450 --> 49:55.245
We're not here to talk
about Mr. Sterling's case.

49:55.286 --> 49:57.288
-What?
-Can I ask you
to verify for us?

49:57.330 --> 50:00.417
Is this your voice
on this recording?

50:00.458 --> 50:01.960
Cliff:
Should we call your father?

50:02.002 --> 50:04.337
Sterling Jr.:
No, we're not calling
my fucking father.

50:04.379 --> 50:05.463
I'm handling this.

50:05.505 --> 50:07.507
Hey, you want me
to turn it up for you.

50:07.549 --> 50:08.883
Sterling Jr.:
I can handle it.

50:10.343 --> 50:11.803
Cliff:
Then tell me what to do.

50:15.765 --> 50:17.350
Cliff LeGrand,
you're under arrest

50:17.392 --> 50:19.644
for the murders of
Jerry and Natalie Hill.

50:23.690 --> 50:24.899
Inevitable.

50:29.946 --> 50:32.991
* *

51:04.022 --> 51:05.065
Thanks.

51:05.106 --> 51:06.566
(chuckles)
No.

51:09.027 --> 51:11.738
Thanks, you.
Thank you.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.074
This is the second massive case
I've closed in six months,

51:14.115 --> 51:15.116
all thanks to you.

51:15.158 --> 51:16.159
Ah.

51:16.201 --> 51:18.286
I'm just happy
you got him.

51:19.287 --> 51:21.414
Him, yeah, but no.

51:21.456 --> 51:24.501
Cliff turned like
a bad penny on Beatrix Hasp.

51:24.542 --> 51:26.628
Sold her down the river
for Sterling Sr.'s death.

51:26.670 --> 51:28.672
That's...

51:28.713 --> 51:30.382
Why do you think I'm not
arresting you right now?

51:30.423 --> 51:31.841
'Cause we're friends.

51:31.883 --> 51:33.677
(chuckles)

51:33.718 --> 51:36.429
I mean, we haven't
caught her yet,

51:36.471 --> 51:37.764
but the word
is out on the street.

51:37.806 --> 51:39.391
She's under siege
from the Southwest Syndicate,

51:39.432 --> 51:40.642
big news for us.

51:41.226 --> 51:42.727
Anyway.

51:42.769 --> 51:44.020
Well, look...

51:45.313 --> 51:46.481
I'm going to ask you
one more time,

51:46.523 --> 51:47.857
as a friend this time.

51:49.984 --> 51:51.403
You want a job?

51:53.279 --> 51:54.280
Had to ask.

51:54.322 --> 51:55.949
-Alright.
-(Charlie chuckles)

51:55.990 --> 51:57.450
Luca:
But keep my number.

51:57.492 --> 51:59.244
I stick with you,
at this rate,

51:59.285 --> 52:00.787
I'll be head of the bureau
in a year.

52:00.829 --> 52:02.330
(chuckles)

52:02.997 --> 52:05.041
So what's next?

52:05.083 --> 52:07.043
Well... what are you, a cop?

52:10.171 --> 52:11.506
Take it easy, man.

52:14.009 --> 52:15.260
There you go, hon.

52:15.301 --> 52:16.845
Come back again, okay?

52:19.431 --> 52:21.224
(doorbell dings)

52:21.266 --> 52:22.809
(can pops)

52:22.851 --> 52:26.021
(phone buzzing)

52:29.190 --> 52:30.525
Yeah.

52:30.567 --> 52:32.485
Beatrix Hasp: (over phone)
Charlie Cale.

52:32.527 --> 52:34.571
Do you know
who this is?

52:34.612 --> 52:38.658
Yeah.
Uh, I have an assumption.

52:44.789 --> 52:46.583
I mean,
Beatrix Hasp, right?

52:47.417 --> 52:48.960
Beatrix:
Yeah.

52:49.002 --> 52:50.378
Yeah, that's what I assumed.

52:51.296 --> 52:53.048
Beatrix:
Well, listen, Charlie,

52:53.089 --> 52:55.050
I'm here
with the Five Families.

52:56.801 --> 52:58.511
You're there with
all five of them?

52:58.553 --> 53:00.513
Beatrix:
Yeah, I got you on speaker.

53:00.555 --> 53:04.267
And what we are dealing
with now is a war.

53:04.309 --> 53:07.020
It's expensive
and a pain in the ass.

53:07.062 --> 53:09.105
And it is no good.
It's bad.

53:09.147 --> 53:11.358
It's ruinous,
is the word.

53:11.399 --> 53:13.360
And it didn't need
to happen.

53:13.401 --> 53:16.446
But it did.
It happened because of you.

53:16.488 --> 53:19.240
Well, I disagree
with that.

53:19.282 --> 53:20.367
Beatrix:
Which is your prerogative.

53:20.408 --> 53:22.494
Look, this is
a courtesy call.

53:22.535 --> 53:24.454
I know what your life's been
for the past year.

53:24.496 --> 53:25.747
That was with Sterling,

53:25.789 --> 53:28.291
who still did surveillance
with cassette tapes.

53:28.333 --> 53:29.584
(Beatrix chuckles)
We, on the other hand,

53:29.626 --> 53:32.504
are a fully modernized
crime syndicate.

53:32.545 --> 53:34.839
There is no corner
of the country deep enough

53:34.881 --> 53:35.590
to hide from us.

53:35.632 --> 53:37.217
We're gonna find you.

53:37.258 --> 53:41.179
And your death will be
neither quick nor comfortable.

53:42.263 --> 53:43.723
Unless...

53:43.765 --> 53:46.893
and this offer expires
when I hang up.

53:46.935 --> 53:50.313
Cliff told me about
your circus freak
lie detector thing.

53:50.355 --> 53:51.648
You come back right now,

53:51.690 --> 53:54.234
you put it to work
for the Hasps,

53:54.275 --> 53:55.985
and we'll see how it goes.

53:57.570 --> 54:00.573
I mean,
look at that highway, kiddo.

54:00.615 --> 54:02.575
This life,
how you're living,

54:02.617 --> 54:04.202
you like that life?

54:04.244 --> 54:06.705
Uh, I don't know.

54:08.123 --> 54:09.916
Uh, I'm good at it.

54:12.961 --> 54:14.004
It's what I got.

54:14.045 --> 54:15.588
Beatrix:
Uh-huh.

54:15.630 --> 54:17.966
And how long
do you think
you can keep it up?

54:18.550 --> 54:19.926
Well, Bea...

54:21.636 --> 54:23.888
let's all of us
find out together.

54:24.472 --> 54:25.640
Huh?

54:29.477 --> 54:32.522
* I hear some people been *

54:32.564 --> 54:35.150
* Talking me down *

54:36.151 --> 54:38.778
* Bring up my name *

54:38.820 --> 54:41.281
* Pass it 'round *

54:41.322 --> 54:43.408
* They don't mention *

54:43.450 --> 54:46.786
* The happy times *

54:46.828 --> 54:49.622
* They do their thing *

54:49.664 --> 54:52.751
* I do mine *

54:52.792 --> 54:58.048
* Ooh, baby,
that's hard to change *

54:58.089 --> 55:02.844
* I can't tell them
how to feel *

55:03.845 --> 55:06.723
* Some get stoned *

55:06.765 --> 55:10.143
* Some get strange *

55:10.185 --> 55:12.187
* But sooner or later *

55:12.228 --> 55:14.522
* It all gets real *

55:14.564 --> 55:16.232
* Walk on *

55:17.233 --> 55:19.194
* Walk on *

55:20.653 --> 55:22.655
* Walk on *

55:22.697 --> 55:24.741
* Walk on *

55:38.004 --> 55:43.510
* I remember
the good old days *

55:43.551 --> 55:46.721
* Stayed up all night *

55:46.763 --> 55:49.265
* Getting crazed *

55:49.307 --> 55:52.102
* Then the money was *

55:52.143 --> 55:54.729
* Not so good *

55:54.771 --> 55:56.815
* But we still did *

55:56.856 --> 56:01.027
* The best we could *

56:01.069 --> 56:05.824
* *
