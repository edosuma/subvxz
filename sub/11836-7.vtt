WEBVTT

00:00.864 --> 00:01.964
WOMAN: Previously on
"The Practice"...

00:01.998 --> 00:03.766
YOUNG: Dozens of kids
have been abused

00:03.799 --> 00:04.767
in this state alone,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.802
and the church knew
what's going on,

00:06.837 --> 00:08.038
did nothing about it,

00:08.071 --> 00:09.405
and let it continue.

00:09.439 --> 00:11.274
And what do you propose
we do, Eugene?

00:11.307 --> 00:12.808
I propose you stop giving

00:12.843 --> 00:15.078
the current institution
the money.

00:15.111 --> 00:17.113
I propose
you be more angry.

00:18.448 --> 00:20.183
DONNELL: Have you ever
thought about

00:20.216 --> 00:22.752
leaving the church
over it?

00:22.785 --> 00:25.621
Bobby, the church
is not just the priests.

00:25.655 --> 00:27.223
It's you and me.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.892
We are the church.

00:28.925 --> 00:30.927
I'm leaving the church,
Father.

00:30.961 --> 00:32.963
Oh, uh, what do you mean?

00:32.996 --> 00:35.031
The sex-abuse scandal--

00:35.065 --> 00:37.267
The offending clergy
makes up

00:37.300 --> 00:39.870
a microscopic portion
of the priesthood.

00:39.903 --> 00:42.438
But the church
is concealing it.

00:42.472 --> 00:44.107
It's enabling
these priests

00:44.140 --> 00:46.709
to destroy
so many young lives.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.879
You can't...

00:48.912 --> 00:50.080
just leave.

00:50.813 --> 00:52.015
Goodbye, Father.

00:58.588 --> 01:01.331
STANLEY: We've been doing it
in this very church

01:01.364 --> 01:04.066
for 17 years, Ellenor.

01:04.099 --> 01:05.902
The problem is
it made the news.

01:05.936 --> 01:08.571
And it's open season
on aberrant religions.

01:08.604 --> 01:12.075
Our faith is partly
Roman Catholic.

01:12.108 --> 01:14.110
It's not nearly as aberrant
as you'd like to--

01:14.144 --> 01:17.013
Sacrificing animals
is out there, Stanley.

01:17.047 --> 01:19.249
At least in the eyes
of mainstream America.

01:19.282 --> 01:20.951
Let's just be
clear about that.

01:20.984 --> 01:23.786
I was just saying that

01:23.819 --> 01:26.890
we all have our rituals.

01:26.923 --> 01:29.025
Look at Christianity
and communion.

01:29.059 --> 01:31.027
They drink
the blood of Christ

01:31.061 --> 01:32.128
and they eat his body.

01:32.162 --> 01:34.230
That's symbolic.

01:34.264 --> 01:36.566
You actually
kill the animal.

01:36.599 --> 01:37.300
I don't understand.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.402
The exact same issue

01:39.435 --> 01:41.371
the Supreme Court
already ruled on,

01:41.404 --> 01:44.140
and we won.
The difference here

01:44.174 --> 01:45.775
is the law
is facially neutral.

01:45.808 --> 01:47.610
It's not targeted
at religion,

01:47.643 --> 01:49.812
but only to stop cruelty.

01:49.846 --> 01:51.381
Even so, we--
Look,

01:51.414 --> 01:54.084
I think we should
consider a plea.

01:54.117 --> 01:56.386
Fine.
I'll admit to the facts.

01:56.419 --> 01:58.855
I did what they say
I did.

01:58.889 --> 02:02.098
But I will not stand up
in a court of law

02:02.132 --> 02:04.067
and acknowledge
any form of guilt.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.535
That's not gonna do it.

02:05.568 --> 02:09.305
Public opinion
is very against you here.

02:09.339 --> 02:11.975
Well, if I say I'm guilty,

02:12.008 --> 02:13.809
it's the equivalent
of apologizing

02:13.844 --> 02:15.545
for my religion.

02:15.578 --> 02:16.913
Add to that,

02:16.946 --> 02:19.916
they can shut our doors.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.352
We need a victory here,
Ellenor.

02:22.385 --> 02:24.054
I can't promise it.

02:24.087 --> 02:26.689
It's a goat,
for God's sake.

02:26.722 --> 02:29.025
They're gonna put me in jail
for killing a goat.

02:29.059 --> 02:31.194
That's what
I'm telling you.

02:31.227 --> 02:32.328
They will.

02:34.831 --> 02:40.170
(music playing)

03:25.088 --> 03:26.689
(phone ringing)

03:26.722 --> 03:28.191
YOUNG: He's insisting on trial?

03:28.224 --> 03:30.126
I tried to dissuade him,
trust me.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.327
STRINGER:
Donnell and Dole...

03:31.361 --> 03:32.628
Are you free in case,
I need some research?

03:32.662 --> 03:33.696
I'm free.

03:33.729 --> 03:34.898
FRUTT: Free exercise clause.

03:34.931 --> 03:35.966
DONNELL: Why do we
seem to be getting

03:35.999 --> 03:37.467
so many cases about religion?

03:37.500 --> 03:40.336
Hey, if I could make this
about religion, we'd win.

03:40.370 --> 03:42.538
Unfortunately,
the statute goes to cruelty,

03:42.572 --> 03:43.806
and the language
is neutral.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.441
What about
de facto of burden?

03:45.876 --> 03:47.677
FRUTT: That's possible
for appeal, but--

03:47.710 --> 03:50.146
Bobby,
Judge Swackheim's office.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.915
You're wanted now.

03:51.948 --> 03:52.983
What do you mean?

03:53.016 --> 03:54.317
He wants you in chambers.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.819
He says to bring a friend.

03:59.830 --> 04:01.231
His lawyer fell out,

04:01.264 --> 04:03.799
the case has already
been continued six times,

04:03.834 --> 04:05.301
and I'll be dead soon.

04:05.335 --> 04:06.302
Why us?

04:06.336 --> 04:08.071
Helen gamble is the D. A.,

04:08.104 --> 04:10.373
and you've had experience
against her.

04:10.406 --> 04:12.342
Also, you're on
the short list of lawyers

04:12.375 --> 04:13.844
willing to defend scum.

04:13.877 --> 04:15.578
Meet with your client,

04:15.611 --> 04:17.547
and I'll see you
in the courtroom tomorrow.

04:17.579 --> 04:18.680
What's the case?

04:18.714 --> 04:19.950
Statutory rape.

04:19.983 --> 04:20.884
I don't want it.

04:20.916 --> 04:22.285
I didn't ask.

04:22.318 --> 04:24.220
10:00 tomorrow morning.

04:24.254 --> 04:25.956
And the court
thanks you both.

04:30.593 --> 04:32.128
You were doing
a news piece?

04:32.162 --> 04:33.596
DANFORTH: Yes. We heard
what was going on,

04:33.629 --> 04:35.398
and we were able
to sneak in a camera.

04:35.431 --> 04:37.633
BRENNER: Mr. Danforth,
could you tell the court

04:37.666 --> 04:39.369
exactly what you observed?

04:39.402 --> 04:41.838
We saw that man,
the defendant,

04:41.872 --> 04:44.007
kill a baby goat.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.675
He basically
slaughtered it.

04:45.708 --> 04:47.677
BRENNER: Okay,
I'm going to play a portion

04:47.710 --> 04:48.879
of this news piece.

04:48.912 --> 04:49.545
Objection.

04:49.579 --> 04:50.680
Overruled.

04:51.081 --> 04:52.082
BRENNER: And I'm going
to ask you, sir,

04:52.115 --> 04:54.851
if it fairly reflects
what you saw that day.

04:54.885 --> 04:56.386
Your Honor,
I renew my objection.

04:56.419 --> 04:57.921
Counsel--
FRUTT: We have stipulated

04:57.954 --> 04:59.896
that my client
causes animals

04:59.930 --> 05:02.999
to be sacrificed
as part of religious worship.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.734
This tape is only
being introduced

05:04.767 --> 05:05.768
to inflame the jury.

05:05.801 --> 05:07.904
BRENNER: The charge
isn't simply killing.

05:07.938 --> 05:10.106
It's cruelty. In order
to make that finding--

05:10.140 --> 05:11.541
FRUTT: Then let him describe
what he saw.

05:11.574 --> 05:14.210
We don't need to see his
media-slanted version of it.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.880
Miss Frutt, I think
we can handle the footage.

05:16.913 --> 05:19.082
If you think it doesn't
accurately portray the events,

05:19.115 --> 05:20.216
you can cross-examine.

05:21.384 --> 05:22.385
BRENNER:
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:25.188 --> 05:26.422
(goat bleats)

05:27.757 --> 05:30.026
Okay, you can see
he has a...

05:30.060 --> 05:31.594
baby goat in his hands.

05:33.196 --> 05:34.397
And it's alive.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.532
Not for long it isn't.

05:36.566 --> 05:37.767
Keep watching.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.371
(people chanting)

05:46.742 --> 05:48.578
And what's he doing now?

05:48.611 --> 05:50.646
DANFORTH: He's letting
the blood drain into a bowl.

05:51.214 --> 05:52.282
It's pretty disgusting.

05:52.315 --> 05:52.983
Objection.

05:53.016 --> 05:54.484
Sustained.

05:55.251 --> 05:56.786
BRENNER: That's all I have.

05:59.762 --> 06:01.531
I saw your news piece.

06:01.564 --> 06:03.834
You seem pretty outraged,
Mr. Danforth.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.936
DANFORTH: I was.
I found what your client did

06:05.969 --> 06:07.437
to be outrageous.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.472
FRUTT: I see.
Do you eat meat?

06:09.505 --> 06:10.740
Do I eat meat?

06:10.773 --> 06:12.275
Yes, ever have a hamburger?

06:12.308 --> 06:13.809
Yes, I eat meat.

06:13.844 --> 06:15.811
Do you know
how cows are killed?

06:15.846 --> 06:17.513
I believe
they're slaughtered.

06:17.547 --> 06:18.514
Would it surprise you
to know

06:18.548 --> 06:20.316
that their throats
are slit,

06:20.350 --> 06:22.218
much in the same way
as this goat died?

06:22.252 --> 06:23.887
DANFORTH: I'm not a fan
of slaughterhouses,

06:23.920 --> 06:26.890
but at least the animal
was killed for sustenance.

06:26.923 --> 06:28.291
We eat cows.

06:28.324 --> 06:31.327
So it's not the manner
in which the animal is killed,

06:31.361 --> 06:33.029
but it's what
it's killed for?

06:33.063 --> 06:35.331
Look, I'm not going down
this road.

06:35.365 --> 06:37.033
I just filmed it.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.402
It's up to you people
to decide if it's illegal.

06:39.435 --> 06:40.203
FRUTT: Fair enough.

06:40.236 --> 06:42.505
By the way,

06:42.538 --> 06:44.374
do you know
what became of the goat

06:44.407 --> 06:45.942
after the ceremony?

06:45.976 --> 06:47.643
No, I do not.

06:47.677 --> 06:49.545
They ate it.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.181
Does that make a difference?

06:54.250 --> 06:56.519
MITCHELL: I didn't force him.

06:56.552 --> 06:58.254
I never forced him.

06:58.288 --> 06:59.355
DONNELL: Mr. Orbis,

06:59.389 --> 07:01.832
he's 13 years old.

07:01.865 --> 07:03.299
Whether you forced him or not--

07:03.333 --> 07:04.734
We were very close.

07:04.767 --> 07:06.369
That's not a defense,
either.

07:06.402 --> 07:08.138
See, I was good to him,

07:08.171 --> 07:09.840
uh, very good.

07:09.873 --> 07:11.741
I'd help him
with his homework

07:11.774 --> 07:12.943
and, uh,

07:12.976 --> 07:14.344
I gave him money.

07:14.377 --> 07:15.912
In exchange for sex?

07:15.946 --> 07:17.047
No,

07:17.080 --> 07:20.583
he did work at my house.

07:20.616 --> 07:21.717
He'd help clean.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.155
And we became close.

07:27.223 --> 07:28.391
I loved him.

07:29.893 --> 07:31.594
And he loved me.

07:33.363 --> 07:35.065
He still loves me.

07:35.098 --> 07:36.099
I know.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.369
BERLUTI: He's the lead
prosecutorial witness.

07:39.402 --> 07:40.770
He's only doing this now

07:40.803 --> 07:43.339
because his mother
is making him.

07:43.373 --> 07:46.509
She told him he can't
come over anymore.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.344
She's making him do this.

07:49.479 --> 07:50.646
I love him,

07:50.680 --> 07:52.615
and I believe...

07:52.648 --> 07:53.884
he loves me.

07:55.551 --> 07:57.587
It's his mother.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.630
Did your other lawyers
ever discuss a plea bargain?

08:00.663 --> 08:02.465
I can't do prison.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.768
They kill child molesters
in prison.

08:05.801 --> 08:07.270
Prison is unacceptable.

08:09.005 --> 08:10.206
I'm telling you,

08:11.374 --> 08:12.742
it's the mother.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.982
Contact the kid's school,

08:19.015 --> 08:20.951
teachers, principal,
guidance counselor.

08:20.984 --> 08:24.187
I'll try to interview
the social worker.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.288
(sighs)

08:25.922 --> 08:27.557
Who do you want,

08:27.590 --> 08:29.392
the mother or the boy?

08:29.425 --> 08:30.894
Sorry?
DONNELL: This case

08:30.927 --> 08:32.062
is pretty much
two witnesses,

08:32.095 --> 08:34.429
the mother and the victim.
Which one do you want?

08:34.464 --> 08:36.099
Personally,
I think it's a mistake

08:36.131 --> 08:38.234
for the client to go in
with two lawyers.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.169
Makes it seem--
Nice try,

08:40.203 --> 08:42.038
but since this goes tomorrow,
there's no time.

08:42.072 --> 08:44.340
We gotta split this up.

08:44.374 --> 08:45.275
Who do you want?

08:45.308 --> 08:46.476
I'll take the mother.

08:47.844 --> 08:49.012
Great.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.214
Our pedophile
has two priors.

08:51.247 --> 08:52.448
Did you know that?

08:52.482 --> 08:53.616
He's sick.

08:53.649 --> 08:55.151
What's your point?

08:55.185 --> 08:57.187
My point is,

08:57.220 --> 08:59.462
how effective can we really
be expected to be

08:59.495 --> 09:00.663
on one day's notice?

09:00.696 --> 09:02.298
I don't wanna hear that.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.200
We do our best.

09:04.234 --> 09:05.568
Fine.

09:06.736 --> 09:08.104
There is a problem here.

09:09.172 --> 09:11.007
We can win this.

09:19.782 --> 09:21.651
He was starting
to go down in school,

09:21.684 --> 09:23.353
which I couldn't understand,

09:23.386 --> 09:25.521
because he's always
been a good student.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.924
Well, did you talk
to your son about this?

09:27.958 --> 09:28.724
LANGER: Yes.

09:28.758 --> 09:31.027
He said there was
nothing wrong.

09:31.061 --> 09:32.996
I said I thought he was spending
too much time with him.

09:33.029 --> 09:34.197
"Him"?

09:34.230 --> 09:35.731
The defendant.

09:35.765 --> 09:39.169
He hired Justin
to do some yard work,

09:39.202 --> 09:40.570
then they became friends.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.573
He was over there
all the time, it seemed.

09:43.606 --> 09:45.708
GAMBLE: Did you suspect
anything sinister

09:45.741 --> 09:47.443
about this relationship?

09:47.477 --> 09:49.012
LANGER:
No. I had no idea

09:49.045 --> 09:51.647
that he had this
porno-film collection

09:51.681 --> 09:52.949
or that previously, he--

09:52.983 --> 09:55.518
Could you tell us
what happened to your son?

09:55.551 --> 09:57.954
LANGER: Well, with his grades
getting worse,

09:57.988 --> 09:59.289
I grounded him.

09:59.322 --> 10:01.832
I told him he had to come home
directly after school.

10:01.865 --> 10:04.167
May I ask,

10:04.200 --> 10:05.535
where was
Justin's father?

10:05.568 --> 10:09.205
We've split up,
and he doesn't--

10:09.239 --> 10:11.041
uh, he's an absent father,

10:11.074 --> 10:13.844
which is another reason
why I thought

10:13.877 --> 10:15.611
he bonded with the defendant.

10:15.645 --> 10:17.780
GAMBLE: Okay.

10:17.813 --> 10:20.683
What happened after
you grounded Justin?

10:20.716 --> 10:23.119
Well, I didn't see
any improvement at school,

10:23.153 --> 10:25.655
so I started to give him
other consequences,

10:25.688 --> 10:28.058
like no baseball,
no television.

10:28.691 --> 10:31.227
I even took away
his stereo.

10:31.261 --> 10:32.395
Nothing seemed to work.

10:32.428 --> 10:34.097
And then finally,

10:36.066 --> 10:37.500
he told me
what was going on.

10:37.533 --> 10:38.734
Which was?

10:38.768 --> 10:40.203
He told me

10:40.236 --> 10:43.139
that he was having sex

10:43.173 --> 10:44.474
with the defendant.

10:45.608 --> 10:46.776
And that he was

10:46.809 --> 10:48.478
feeling shame over it,

10:48.511 --> 10:50.881
and that he was having
trouble sleeping.

10:50.914 --> 10:52.548
And what did you do?

10:52.582 --> 10:54.450
I notified the police.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.488
I called the police.

10:58.521 --> 11:00.997
Actually,
you waited two days

11:01.031 --> 11:02.765
to call the police,
didn't you, ma'am?

11:02.798 --> 11:05.035
Yes.
BERLUTI: Your son tells you

11:05.068 --> 11:06.302
he's raped,

11:06.336 --> 11:07.737
you don't call
for two days?

11:07.770 --> 11:10.340
LANGER: At first, I just--
I couldn't believe it.

11:10.373 --> 11:12.108
I thought maybe
he was trying to...

11:12.142 --> 11:14.911
escape punishment, or--

11:14.945 --> 11:16.379
You thought
he was making it up.

11:16.412 --> 11:19.049
I was just
so stunned at first.

11:19.082 --> 11:20.216
I couldn't believe it.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.617
I guess I was--

11:21.651 --> 11:23.386
I was desperate
not to believe it.

11:23.419 --> 11:25.121
But once it sank in
that it was true,

11:25.155 --> 11:26.389
I called the police.

11:26.422 --> 11:30.060
You mentioned your son wanting
to escape punishment.

11:30.093 --> 11:31.627
You mean being grounded,

11:31.661 --> 11:33.129
missing baseball,
that sort of thing?

11:33.163 --> 11:35.431
Yes.
How about you hitting him?

11:36.199 --> 11:37.300
You ever hit your son,
Mrs. Langer?

11:37.333 --> 11:39.635
Objection.
Where is this going?

11:39.669 --> 11:41.571
BERLUTI: Your Honor,
sometimes kids will say anything

11:41.604 --> 11:43.073
to make the beatings stop.
I did not beat him!

11:43.106 --> 11:44.607
GAMBLE: Objection.
Move to strike.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.476
Short leash.
Speed it up.

11:46.509 --> 11:48.879
Did you ever hit your son,
Mrs. Langer?

11:48.912 --> 11:50.981
I spanked him sometimes.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.448
I did not beat him.

11:52.482 --> 11:53.716
BERLUTI: Did you spank him
on account

11:53.749 --> 11:54.784
of his grades going down?

11:54.817 --> 11:56.786
I spanked him once or twice.

11:56.819 --> 11:57.753
They were not beatings,

11:57.787 --> 11:59.155
and I certainly
never hurt him.

11:59.189 --> 12:01.431
BERLUTI: Did you ever hit
your son for using drugs?

12:01.464 --> 12:03.299
He once used marijuana

12:03.333 --> 12:04.600
that your client
gave him,

12:04.634 --> 12:06.336
and, yes,
I spanked him.

12:06.369 --> 12:08.071
BERLUTI: Do you work,
Mrs. Langer?

12:09.105 --> 12:11.007
Yes.
What do you do for work?

12:11.041 --> 12:12.675
I'm a waitress
in a restaurant.

12:12.708 --> 12:13.944
Could you tell me
your hours?

12:13.977 --> 12:15.245
3:00 to 11:00.

12:15.278 --> 12:17.080
3:00 in the afternoon
till 11:00 at night?

12:17.113 --> 12:17.813
Yes.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.682
BERLUTI: Weekdays?
LANGER: Yes.

12:19.715 --> 12:21.317
When does your son
get home from school?

12:21.351 --> 12:22.818
Between 2:00 and 3:00.

12:22.853 --> 12:25.355
Wow. So, you barely see him
during the week.

12:26.822 --> 12:29.025
Possible, he could've made
this story up

12:29.059 --> 12:29.993
to get your attention?

12:30.026 --> 12:31.061
No.

12:31.094 --> 12:33.129
That is not possible.

12:33.163 --> 12:34.898
Ever know your son
to tell you things

12:34.931 --> 12:37.100
that maybe weren't true?
No.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.202
Your son always
speaks the truth?

12:39.235 --> 12:41.404
Yes. He is
a truthful person.

12:41.437 --> 12:42.638
Yes, he is.

12:42.672 --> 12:45.508
BERLUTI: And yet,
when he tells you he was raped,

12:45.541 --> 12:48.811
you don't call the police
for two days?

12:48.845 --> 12:51.781
(music playing)

12:57.420 --> 13:00.363
(indistinct chatter)

13:04.200 --> 13:05.335
(elevator doors close)

13:12.042 --> 13:13.176
Good job.

13:15.811 --> 13:18.348
Bobby,
what are we doing here?

13:29.425 --> 13:32.262
It's basically a traditional
African religion

13:32.295 --> 13:34.164
with elements
of Roman Catholicism.

13:34.197 --> 13:36.366
But the reason
we're all here

13:36.399 --> 13:38.368
is because of one
particular ritual.

13:38.401 --> 13:41.504
Yes.
FRUTT: Can you tell the jury

13:41.537 --> 13:43.373
why sacrifice animals?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.909
It's a way of honoring
The Orisha,

13:45.942 --> 13:48.879
which literally means
"head guardian."

13:48.912 --> 13:50.280
In simplest terms,

13:50.313 --> 13:52.815
the animal's blood
is offered.

13:52.849 --> 13:54.384
The sacrifice

13:54.417 --> 13:55.852
is said to please the saints

13:55.886 --> 13:57.653
and bring purification

13:57.687 --> 13:58.955
and forgiveness of sins.

13:58.989 --> 14:01.397
You have to acknowledge,
Mr. Joley,

14:01.431 --> 14:03.633
this does seem
a little barbaric.

14:03.666 --> 14:06.136
We know that American culture
rejects it,

14:06.169 --> 14:07.170
and we therefore try to be

14:07.203 --> 14:09.572
as discrete as possible,
even secretive.

14:09.605 --> 14:11.541
We've never tried to impose
our rituals

14:11.574 --> 14:13.543
or beliefs upon the public.

14:13.576 --> 14:16.546
And, in fact, the only reason
we're here today

14:16.579 --> 14:18.882
is because the media
invaded us.

14:18.915 --> 14:20.951
Does the animal suffer?

14:20.984 --> 14:23.153
The sacrifice
is almost always quick,

14:23.186 --> 14:25.555
and as humane as possible.

14:25.588 --> 14:27.823
BRENNER:
So, it's your testimony that

14:27.858 --> 14:29.259
what we all saw
on the television screen,

14:29.292 --> 14:30.526
in your eyes,

14:30.560 --> 14:31.627
there was no
animal cruelty.

14:31.661 --> 14:34.898
We try to be as humane
as possible.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.233
BRENNER:
And you do that with lambs,

14:37.267 --> 14:38.701
goats, turtles,

14:38.734 --> 14:40.603
guinea pigs, sheep,

14:40.636 --> 14:41.404
all those animals.

14:41.437 --> 14:42.472
You slit their throats

14:42.505 --> 14:44.307
and offer the blood
to your saints?

14:44.340 --> 14:45.842
Yes.

14:47.911 --> 14:50.813
He did well, considering.

14:50.847 --> 14:52.282
But?
FRUTT: But...

14:52.315 --> 14:54.184
he couldn't undo
that videotape, Eugene.

14:54.217 --> 14:56.052
How could he?
That footage?

14:56.086 --> 14:57.988
That's what the jury's
gonna take back to that room,

14:58.021 --> 14:59.529
that squealing goat.

14:59.562 --> 15:02.398
Well, Ellenor,
if it's a tale of the tape,

15:02.432 --> 15:03.799
then get yourself some tape.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.635
What do you mean?
YOUNG: I mean,

15:05.668 --> 15:07.470
this is America.

15:07.503 --> 15:10.273
You think Santerians are
the only ones to kill animals?

15:14.044 --> 15:16.446
(knock on door, door opens)

15:17.647 --> 15:18.781
Don't even waste your breath.

15:18.814 --> 15:21.284
Your Honor--
You're not getting off, Bobby.

15:21.317 --> 15:22.552
Anything else?

15:23.954 --> 15:26.857
Look, it doesn't matter
who they are or what they are.

15:26.890 --> 15:28.724
They're all entitled
to a defense.

15:28.758 --> 15:30.760
I didn't make up the rule.

15:30.793 --> 15:33.496
What constitutes "adequate"?
What?

15:33.529 --> 15:35.165
They're not entitled
to the best defense,

15:35.198 --> 15:36.166
only "adequate."

15:36.199 --> 15:38.668
So I'm asking,
how much is "adequate"?

15:39.769 --> 15:40.803
Sit.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.143
You think I want
that piece of crap walking?

15:48.111 --> 15:50.646
Tell me the ideology
of the criminal lawyer,

15:50.680 --> 15:51.915
if you remember.

15:52.748 --> 15:54.350
"To check the state's power

15:54.384 --> 15:56.386
to incarcerate people
at will."

15:56.419 --> 15:58.488
You get a gold star.

15:58.521 --> 15:59.429
Now look at me.

15:59.462 --> 16:01.697
Look at what's going on
out there.

16:01.731 --> 16:05.568
The state regularly jails people
without due process,

16:05.601 --> 16:07.904
then calls them
material witnesses,

16:07.938 --> 16:09.940
and locks them up
without even filing charges,

16:09.973 --> 16:11.774
much less giving them
a hearing.

16:11.807 --> 16:13.743
You're talking about
terrorist suspects, this--

16:13.776 --> 16:15.678
Who says it has
to stop there?

16:15.711 --> 16:17.247
You don't think
there are people out there

16:17.280 --> 16:19.149
who want to extend
that policy

16:19.182 --> 16:21.051
to suspected
child molesters?

16:21.084 --> 16:23.119
I understand the system,
judge,

16:23.153 --> 16:25.388
and I appreciate
my role in it.

16:25.421 --> 16:27.190
Then why are you here?

16:27.223 --> 16:29.792
I have to get up tomorrow

16:29.825 --> 16:32.828
and attack a 13-year-old
rape victim.

16:35.498 --> 16:36.732
And I don't wanna do it.

16:36.766 --> 16:38.601
Well, you will.

16:38.634 --> 16:40.236
And if I tank it?

16:40.270 --> 16:41.838
Please.

16:41.872 --> 16:44.274
You don't think I just
pulled your name out of a hat.

16:52.615 --> 16:54.250
You okay?

16:54.284 --> 16:55.285
Yeah.

16:56.486 --> 16:59.896
It's just--

16:59.930 --> 17:03.133
this isn't exactly what I went
to law school for, Eugene.

17:03.166 --> 17:06.036
Fighting for
serial goat killers.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.170
Are you serious?

17:08.637 --> 17:10.373
Ellenor,

17:10.406 --> 17:12.242
why did you go
to law school?

17:13.776 --> 17:15.912
Clarence Darrow.

17:15.945 --> 17:18.381
I read his closing
on Leopold and Loeb

17:18.414 --> 17:21.284
over and over and over.

17:21.317 --> 17:22.117
For me,

17:22.152 --> 17:24.855
it was the constitution.

17:24.887 --> 17:27.823
I was 12, and I couldn't
understand half of it,

17:27.858 --> 17:29.926
but I knew...

17:29.960 --> 17:31.227
this was something.

17:31.261 --> 17:34.364
And you know the part
that especially got me?

17:35.065 --> 17:37.233
Freedom of religion.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.002
I know that probably
sounds funny,

17:39.035 --> 17:41.304
uh, considering how I've been
acting towards religion lately,

17:41.337 --> 17:44.074
but that amendment,

17:44.107 --> 17:46.877
it said to me that
at least in principle,

17:46.910 --> 17:49.712
this country
stands for tolerance.

17:49.745 --> 17:52.448
And, Ellenor, of all
the constitutional liberties

17:52.482 --> 17:54.817
that need protecting today,

17:54.851 --> 17:57.720
freedom of religion.

17:57.753 --> 17:59.022
I understand that.

17:59.055 --> 18:00.696
I really do, but...

18:00.730 --> 18:02.365
But what?

18:03.699 --> 18:05.201
I like goats.

18:06.469 --> 18:08.438
Trust me, Ellenor,

18:08.471 --> 18:11.341
this case...

18:11.374 --> 18:13.609
is exactly why
you went to law school.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.558
Ms. Elder, as a member
of the American Humane Society,

18:28.591 --> 18:30.193
you've had occasion
to document

18:30.226 --> 18:31.427
the footage
we're about to see.

18:31.461 --> 18:34.764
All the footage is accurate
and has been verified.

18:35.966 --> 18:38.101
Can you narrate,
Ms. Elder?

18:38.935 --> 18:40.904
ELDER: That is a cow
being killed

18:40.937 --> 18:42.839
at a slaughterhouse in Texas.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.675
A pig.

18:47.777 --> 18:48.811
Chicken.

18:50.413 --> 18:52.082
Examples of trapping.

18:53.149 --> 18:54.617
Laboratory testing.

18:57.888 --> 18:58.955
Baby seals.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.897
This is Canada,
not the U. S.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.771
The question becomes,
Ms. Elder,

19:08.804 --> 19:10.273
are these isolated events?

19:10.306 --> 19:12.608
Isolated? Certainly not.

19:12.642 --> 19:13.977
It goes on every day.

19:15.278 --> 19:16.479
BRENNER:
Ms. Elder, I'm curious.

19:16.512 --> 19:17.613
Did you get a chance

19:17.647 --> 19:19.449
to see the tape
showing what goes on

19:19.482 --> 19:20.316
in the defendant's church?

19:20.350 --> 19:21.251
I did.

19:21.284 --> 19:22.818
BRENNER: In your opinion,

19:22.853 --> 19:25.255
did you find
the defendant's actions

19:25.288 --> 19:27.157
to constitute animal cruelty?

19:27.190 --> 19:28.124
Objection.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.293
She can give a lay opinion,
not legal.

19:30.326 --> 19:33.897
He slit a goat's neck
and let the blood drain out.

19:33.930 --> 19:35.331
It was repulsive.

19:38.401 --> 19:40.336
Justin,
if you wanna stop,

19:40.370 --> 19:42.172
or you feel
you need to take a break,

19:42.205 --> 19:44.440
you tell me.
Okay.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.143
GAMBLE: You said the two of you
started to become friends.

19:47.177 --> 19:50.146
JUSTIN:
Yes, after I'd finish my work,

19:50.180 --> 19:54.584
we'd play cards and games.

19:54.617 --> 19:57.587
And then we started to watch
videos and stuff.

19:58.054 --> 19:59.355
GAMBLE: What kinds of videos?

19:59.389 --> 20:03.066
JUSTIN: Well, at first,
just comedies and stuff,

20:03.099 --> 20:04.334
like "The Nutty Professor"

20:04.367 --> 20:05.735
and "Austin Powers."

20:05.768 --> 20:09.039
And then after a while,

20:09.072 --> 20:10.773
sex videos.

20:10.806 --> 20:12.775
GAMBLE: And these videos,

20:12.808 --> 20:15.278
men and women
were having sex?

20:15.311 --> 20:17.413
Some men and women.

20:18.714 --> 20:21.717
But mostly just
men and men,

20:23.186 --> 20:25.155
or men and boys.

20:25.588 --> 20:27.490
GAMBLE: What did you think
when you saw this?

20:28.258 --> 20:29.492
I don't know.

20:30.961 --> 20:33.296
I guess it kind of
grossed me out.

20:35.098 --> 20:36.799
But, you know,
Mitchell,

20:36.833 --> 20:39.069
he said it was
very common

20:39.102 --> 20:41.137
for men to have sex
with each other.

20:41.171 --> 20:43.106
GAMBLE:
What did you think of that?

20:44.274 --> 20:45.341
I don't know.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.010
Justin,

20:48.244 --> 20:49.512
at some point,

20:50.780 --> 20:53.249
did you and Mr. Orbis
have sex?

20:55.751 --> 20:56.752
Yes.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.621
Could you tell us about it?

20:58.654 --> 21:02.332
(music playing)

21:06.569 --> 21:07.603
GAMBLE: Justin,

21:10.941 --> 21:15.711
look, I know this is
very difficult for you,

21:15.745 --> 21:17.680
but you are
completely safe here,

21:17.713 --> 21:18.882
I promise.

21:19.749 --> 21:21.952
We need for you
to tell us what happened.

21:25.421 --> 21:26.857
JUSTIN: He, um,

21:28.859 --> 21:31.394
he would touch
my privates.

21:31.427 --> 21:32.462
GAMBLE: By touch,

21:32.495 --> 21:34.297
how would he touch you?

21:35.231 --> 21:37.400
With his hand,
with his mouth.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.469
GAMBLE: His mouth?

21:39.502 --> 21:43.373
JUSTIN: Yeah. He would put
his mouth on my privates.

21:43.406 --> 21:45.675
By privates, you mean...

21:46.242 --> 21:47.978
My penis.

21:48.011 --> 21:49.812
And he would ask me

21:49.846 --> 21:52.415
to put my mouth
on his penis.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.517
GAMBLE: Did you?

21:56.052 --> 21:57.520
Yes.

21:57.553 --> 21:59.055
GAMBLE:
Justin, I promise you,

21:59.089 --> 22:01.564
I'm almost done.

22:01.597 --> 22:03.967
How many times
did this happen?

22:05.401 --> 22:06.402
A lot.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.172
A lot.

22:09.205 --> 22:10.974
More than 10 times?

22:12.175 --> 22:13.443
Yes.

22:13.476 --> 22:15.445
More than 20?

22:19.749 --> 22:22.685
(sobs)

22:24.787 --> 22:26.890
Your Honor, I think we should
take a small break.

22:43.806 --> 22:45.175
He never cried...

22:47.443 --> 22:48.644
because he liked it.

22:50.013 --> 22:52.949
And I think that his mother

22:52.983 --> 22:55.485
told him to cry.

22:57.888 --> 23:01.497
I promise, he never cried.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.371
BRENNER: This isn't a case
about religion.

23:08.404 --> 23:12.042
It is about cruelty to animals.

23:12.075 --> 23:13.343
You saw the tape.

23:13.376 --> 23:16.612
This man dangled a baby goat

23:16.646 --> 23:18.781
as people danced behind him,

23:18.814 --> 23:20.650
and he slit its throat.

23:20.683 --> 23:23.319
He does it with pigs, sheep,

23:23.353 --> 23:26.289
turtles, chickens, doves.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.191
Pulls out his knife
or box cutters--

23:28.224 --> 23:29.359
FRUTT: Objection!

23:29.392 --> 23:31.827
There has never been
a suggestion of box cutters.

23:31.862 --> 23:33.629
I only meant cutting
instruments.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.797
We all know what you meant,

23:34.831 --> 23:36.632
and I object
to the blatant innuendo.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.367
MANTLE: All right.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.935
Careful, Mr. Brenner.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.539
We're not here today
to pass judgment

23:43.573 --> 23:45.108
on the Santerian faith.

23:45.141 --> 23:46.977
All of us, every one of us,

23:47.010 --> 23:49.079
is free to choose
our form of worship,

23:49.112 --> 23:50.780
of course we are.

23:50.813 --> 23:53.449
But the exercise,
the practice of religion,

23:53.483 --> 23:55.051
has never been absolute.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.520
Whether it's public health
or safety,

23:57.553 --> 23:59.662
or yes, even morals,

23:59.695 --> 24:01.164
the state can step in and say,

24:01.197 --> 24:03.733
"Whoa, can't do that."

24:03.766 --> 24:06.202
Here, they torture

24:06.236 --> 24:07.904
and mutilate animals

24:07.938 --> 24:10.740
in an open and notorious manner.

24:10.773 --> 24:13.844
We as a society
don't tolerate that.

24:13.877 --> 24:15.211
How could we?

24:16.812 --> 24:19.082
We don't tolerate it?

24:19.115 --> 24:21.551
What society
is he talking about?

24:21.584 --> 24:25.055
We live in a society that
slaughters animals for food,

24:25.088 --> 24:26.522
we kill them for fur coats,

24:26.556 --> 24:28.824
we poison them
to test new drugs.

24:28.859 --> 24:32.195
We torture animals all the time.

24:32.228 --> 24:35.832
We even murder them for sport.

24:35.866 --> 24:37.800
We hunt, we fish,

24:37.834 --> 24:40.070
we walk up to deer
with our shotguns

24:40.103 --> 24:41.171
and we blow off their heads.

24:41.204 --> 24:42.939
We yank fish out of the water,

24:42.973 --> 24:44.174
and we let them suffocate

24:44.207 --> 24:45.508
at the bottom of our boats.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.777
If you wanna convict my client

24:47.810 --> 24:50.713
for being cruel, fine,

24:50.746 --> 24:52.648
but don't you dare do so

24:52.682 --> 24:55.018
under some cloak of humanity

24:55.051 --> 24:59.089
that we as a society
don't torture animals.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.464
And I would submit

25:01.497 --> 25:03.799
that if we say it's okay
to hunt them down

25:03.834 --> 25:06.402
and to maim them
for recreation,

25:06.436 --> 25:08.004
for vanity,

25:08.038 --> 25:11.274
or even for Thanksgiving,

25:11.307 --> 25:16.279
how do we say no for worship,

25:16.312 --> 25:17.914
a traditional worship

25:17.948 --> 25:20.750
that dates back over
a thousand years?

25:21.784 --> 25:24.287
Personally,
I don't like what they do,

25:24.320 --> 25:28.291
but you simply
cannot condemn this man

25:28.324 --> 25:31.694
under some theory
that killing animals

25:31.727 --> 25:34.965
isn't tolerated by
the United States of America,

25:34.998 --> 25:37.300
because it is.

25:37.333 --> 25:42.338
Every time you eat a hamburger,

25:42.372 --> 25:45.441
you not only tolerate it,

25:45.475 --> 25:47.177
you proliferate it.

25:51.647 --> 25:53.884
DONNELL: It's a pretty serious
thing to accuse someone

25:53.917 --> 25:55.919
of statutory rape, Justin.

25:58.955 --> 26:00.763
How long had this
been going on for?

26:00.796 --> 26:02.632
Three months or so.

26:02.665 --> 26:03.666
And you never told anybody?

26:03.699 --> 26:05.501
I was too embarrassed.

26:05.535 --> 26:07.670
DONNELL: You started getting in
trouble at school, didn't you?

26:07.703 --> 26:10.740
I saw detentions for fighting,
swearing at a teacher.

26:10.773 --> 26:12.775
You get suspended
for swearing at a teacher?

26:12.808 --> 26:14.510
No.
DONNELL: No?

26:14.544 --> 26:15.846
Oh, that's right,
the principal thought

26:15.879 --> 26:18.181
this behavior was a cry
for attention.

26:18.214 --> 26:20.050
Do you remember him
saying that?

26:20.083 --> 26:21.451
Yes.

26:21.484 --> 26:22.986
Ever accuse another kid
at school

26:23.019 --> 26:24.554
of doing anything to you?

26:26.156 --> 26:27.490
Russell LaFevre?

26:27.523 --> 26:29.692
Did you once accuse
Russell LaFevre

26:29.725 --> 26:31.061
of punching you from behind?

26:31.895 --> 26:34.297
Yes.
Did Russell LaFevre punch you?

26:35.365 --> 26:36.332
No.

26:36.867 --> 26:37.868
You made it up?

26:37.901 --> 26:39.302
I'm not making this up.

26:39.335 --> 26:40.736
DONNELL: You made it up
against Russell.

26:40.770 --> 26:41.905
I can explain that.

26:41.938 --> 26:43.406
DONNELL: You don't
have to explain it.

26:43.439 --> 26:45.475
Just tell us, yes or no,

26:45.508 --> 26:47.510
did you make up
false accusations

26:47.543 --> 26:49.812
against Russell LaFevre?

26:50.580 --> 26:51.647
Yes.

26:51.681 --> 26:54.484
DONNELL: Ever get caught
cheating on a test, Justin?

26:54.517 --> 26:55.551
Once.

26:55.585 --> 26:57.620
That's cheating and lying.

26:57.653 --> 26:59.055
Objection!
Withdrawn.

26:59.089 --> 27:00.763
Do you take drugs, Justin?

27:00.796 --> 27:03.199
All right.
This is the accusing witness.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.235
Go ahead.

27:05.268 --> 27:07.303
Ever smoke marijuana, Justin?
Yes.

27:07.337 --> 27:08.905
DONNELL: You got caught
smoking it at school,

27:08.939 --> 27:11.107
didn't you?
Yes.

27:11.141 --> 27:12.408
You told the principal
that you got it

27:12.442 --> 27:13.543
from one
of the high school kids,

27:13.576 --> 27:15.645
told your mother you got it
from Mr. Orbis.

27:15.678 --> 27:17.580
Who were you lying to,
the school principal

27:17.613 --> 27:19.382
or your mother, Justin?

27:19.415 --> 27:20.416
I got it from Mitchell.

27:20.450 --> 27:22.018
DONNELL: So you lied yet again

27:22.052 --> 27:22.953
to the principal?

27:22.986 --> 27:23.719
Yes, but I didn't want any--

27:23.753 --> 27:24.955
DONNELL: Thank you.

27:24.988 --> 27:27.423
After you were caught
with drugs, Justin,

27:27.457 --> 27:29.259
you got suspended then,
didn't you?

27:29.292 --> 27:32.028
Yes.
And this is when--

27:48.178 --> 27:50.446
after you were suspended
for drugs,

27:50.480 --> 27:51.982
how did your mother react?

27:52.015 --> 27:53.049
She was angry.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.551
DONNELL: Angry?
Did she hit you?

27:55.585 --> 27:56.853
JUSTIN: She spanked me.

27:56.887 --> 27:59.896
DONNELL: And this is when
you suddenly declared

27:59.930 --> 28:03.066
that Mr. Orbis had molested you.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.501
Did you say that
for sympathy, Justin?

28:05.535 --> 28:07.737
No! It's the truth.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.772
I see. So your mother,
two days later,

28:09.805 --> 28:11.707
finally decided
to believe you,

28:11.741 --> 28:13.609
and she called the police.

28:13.643 --> 28:14.845
And when you talked
to the police,

28:14.878 --> 28:16.779
you had to give them a lot
of different statements,

28:16.812 --> 28:18.114
didn't you?
Yes.

28:18.148 --> 28:19.782
DONNELL: The first two times
you met with the police,

28:19.815 --> 28:22.052
you said nothing about Mr. Orbis

28:22.085 --> 28:24.620
putting his mouth
on your penis,

28:24.654 --> 28:26.222
or yours on his.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.758
You never said that,
did you, Justin?

28:28.791 --> 28:30.193
I was too embarrassed.

28:30.226 --> 28:31.361
DONNELL: Too embarrassed?

28:31.394 --> 28:32.328
When did you come up
with the idea

28:32.362 --> 28:33.496
to add that part?

28:33.529 --> 28:34.330
Objection!

28:34.364 --> 28:35.531
Overruled.

28:35.565 --> 28:37.067
You made that up,
didn't you, Justin?

28:37.100 --> 28:38.101
No!
DONNELL: Well, Justin,

28:38.134 --> 28:40.603
do you understand
that you have an obligation

28:40.636 --> 28:42.138
to tell the truth here?

28:42.172 --> 28:45.408
We're not in the principal's
office now, we're in court.

28:45.441 --> 28:47.143
Your lies are hurting people.

28:47.177 --> 28:48.845
I am telling the truth.

28:48.879 --> 28:52.615
So, this isn't another
false accusation?

28:52.648 --> 28:54.284
This time,
you're sticking with it?

28:54.317 --> 28:55.285
Objection!

28:55.318 --> 28:56.652
Withdrawn. Nothing further.

29:01.097 --> 29:02.899
Commonwealth rests,
Your Honor.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.334
SWACKHEIM:
Mr. Donnell, you could call

29:04.367 --> 29:05.635
your first witness tonight,

29:05.668 --> 29:07.503
or we can wait and start
tomorrow.

29:10.806 --> 29:13.143
Counsel? Did you hear me?

29:20.583 --> 29:22.385
The defense rests, Your Honor.

29:36.366 --> 29:37.400
(sighs)

29:44.674 --> 29:45.741
I can't talk now.

29:45.775 --> 29:46.809
PATRICK: Can't talk?

29:46.843 --> 29:49.479
How about just looking
me in the eye, then, Bobby?

29:49.512 --> 29:51.047
Can you do that?

29:51.081 --> 29:52.715
You hypocrite!

29:52.748 --> 29:55.418
You leave the church,
accusing us of enabling sex--

29:55.451 --> 29:56.853
There's a difference between--

29:56.887 --> 29:58.421
There's a difference?!
Yes!

29:58.454 --> 30:01.131
Between representing somebody
who's committed a crime,

30:01.164 --> 30:02.465
and protecting his secret

30:02.498 --> 30:03.967
so he can go on
committing it.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.201
There's a big difference.

30:05.235 --> 30:06.136
That's crap.

30:06.169 --> 30:07.370
I gotta leave.

30:07.403 --> 30:08.671
Then you're gonna have
to knock me over,

30:08.704 --> 30:10.706
because I'm not moving,
you son of a bitch,

30:10.740 --> 30:13.009
until you listen
to what I have to say!

30:13.043 --> 30:15.711
You're helping him
secure his freedom!

30:15.745 --> 30:18.081
How is that not enabling
more rapes?!

30:18.114 --> 30:20.050
I was ordered by the court!

30:20.083 --> 30:21.651
Then quit your profession.

30:21.684 --> 30:23.753
You're a man
that's quite capable

30:23.786 --> 30:24.921
of walking out
of a door, Bobby.

30:24.955 --> 30:26.456
We both know that.

30:26.489 --> 30:28.424
Walk out on
the legal profession,

30:28.458 --> 30:30.393
like you walked out
on the church.

30:30.426 --> 30:33.897
How dare you judge me
or the Catholic people?

30:33.930 --> 30:35.365
Too bad you can't save
some of your rage

30:35.398 --> 30:36.900
for your fellow priests.

30:36.933 --> 30:40.904
I have plenty of rage
for them, believe me,

30:40.937 --> 30:44.574
and I'm standing here
right now condemning you,

30:44.607 --> 30:46.742
mostly for your hypocrisy!

30:46.776 --> 30:48.444
Step away from the door,
Father.

30:48.478 --> 30:49.712
I'm going.

30:51.447 --> 30:54.250
Allow me, Bobby,
to walk out on you.

30:58.188 --> 30:59.395
(door slammed closed)

31:06.169 --> 31:08.438
I'll bet Helen chased him down
and set him in motion.

31:08.471 --> 31:09.472
Helen?
DONNELL: To distract me.

31:09.505 --> 31:10.606
How the hell
would he even know

31:10.640 --> 31:11.607
what case I'm doing?

31:11.641 --> 31:12.909
Bobby, it's been in the papers.

31:12.943 --> 31:14.077
It would be just like her.

31:14.110 --> 31:16.546
Okay, you need to take
a breath, and--

31:16.579 --> 31:17.813
Lindsay, this is no time.

31:17.848 --> 31:19.215
DOLE: Helen Gamble
did not go

31:19.249 --> 31:20.683
running to a church
to rattle you,

31:20.716 --> 31:22.185
and if you think that,

31:22.218 --> 31:23.753
you're rattled already.

31:24.454 --> 31:26.689
Maybe you should let
Jimmy close.

31:26.722 --> 31:28.558
I can close.
Bobby--

31:28.591 --> 31:29.759
I can close, damn it!

31:39.335 --> 31:40.703
What does it mean
when they make up

31:40.736 --> 31:42.605
their minds so fast?

31:42.638 --> 31:43.840
They're decisive.

31:45.341 --> 31:46.576
Hang in there.

31:47.010 --> 31:48.912
I prayed all night.

31:48.945 --> 31:50.646
Used up six cats.

31:52.215 --> 31:53.683
That was a joke.

31:55.118 --> 31:57.587
MANTLE: Madam Foreperson,
the jury has reached a verdict?

31:57.854 --> 31:58.989
We have, Your Honor.

31:59.022 --> 32:00.530
Will the defendant please rise?

32:03.133 --> 32:04.334
What say you?

32:04.367 --> 32:06.970
"The Commonwealth versus
Stanley Joley."

32:07.003 --> 32:09.039
On the charge of cruelty
to animals,

32:09.072 --> 32:12.708
"We find the defendant,
Stanley Joley,

32:13.609 --> 32:15.045
not guilty."

32:15.078 --> 32:16.712
(exhales deeply)

32:16.746 --> 32:19.449
MANTLE: The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

32:19.482 --> 32:20.616
We're adjourned.

32:20.650 --> 32:21.517
(gavel bangs)

32:22.718 --> 32:24.187
Congratulations.

32:24.220 --> 32:25.922
Thank you.

32:25.956 --> 32:29.092
Ellenor, I know
this ritual you found

32:29.125 --> 32:30.593
to be personally repugnant,

32:30.626 --> 32:31.995
which makes
your defense of it

32:32.028 --> 32:35.698
and my rights all
the more heroic.

32:35.731 --> 32:36.833
Thank you.

32:39.002 --> 32:41.204
GAMBLE:
Heroes are not easily found.

32:41.237 --> 32:44.507
Takes an enormous
amount of courage

32:44.540 --> 32:48.011
for a victim of child
molestation to come forward.

32:49.279 --> 32:50.680
Most don't.

32:50.713 --> 32:53.549
Most think it's somehow
their own fault,

32:53.583 --> 32:56.386
and the shame
is too much to bear.

32:56.419 --> 32:59.829
And for those who can overcome
the embarrassment,

33:01.231 --> 33:04.868
there's the prospect
of having to sit in a courtroom,

33:04.901 --> 33:07.570
day after day with the man
who raped you.

33:07.603 --> 33:10.473
We live in a country
where the suspect

33:10.506 --> 33:14.344
has a constitutional right
to confront his accuser,

33:14.377 --> 33:16.913
and somewhere along the way,

33:16.947 --> 33:19.482
confront became attack.

33:19.515 --> 33:22.018
You saw it here

33:22.052 --> 33:25.321
with Justin Langer
being assaulted in that chair

33:25.355 --> 33:26.622
by defense counsel.

33:27.390 --> 33:29.792
One almost had to wonder,

33:30.226 --> 33:31.594
was it worth it?

33:33.329 --> 33:36.833
Well, when the alternative
is a rapist

33:36.867 --> 33:41.137
going on to possibly rape
other children,

33:41.171 --> 33:42.906
yeah, it's worth it.

33:42.939 --> 33:46.209
That's why I consider
this young man to be a hero.

33:46.242 --> 33:47.743
He came into this room

33:47.777 --> 33:50.513
to face down the man
who raped him.

33:52.548 --> 33:54.650
And his testimony

33:54.684 --> 33:56.987
is uncontroverted.

33:57.020 --> 33:59.322
He told you...

33:59.355 --> 34:02.732
how the defendant
would repeatedly engage him

34:02.765 --> 34:04.700
in acts of oral copulation,

34:04.734 --> 34:08.237
how this man with a library
of pornographic videos

34:08.271 --> 34:11.206
would use those videos

34:11.241 --> 34:14.077
to seduce this child.

34:14.110 --> 34:17.112
He's 13 years old,

34:17.147 --> 34:21.083
13, and he was raped.

34:22.318 --> 34:26.389
Pedophiles repeat their crimes.

34:28.024 --> 34:31.161
Please, don't give this one

34:31.194 --> 34:33.795
the opportunity to do so.

34:58.955 --> 35:02.498
Ms. Gamble talked
about our system,

35:02.532 --> 35:04.534
rights of defendants
and victims.

35:04.567 --> 35:06.837
You know that
90-something percent

35:06.870 --> 35:09.072
of all defendants are guilty?

35:09.639 --> 35:11.241
Think about it.

35:11.274 --> 35:12.175
By the time they get to trial,

35:12.208 --> 35:15.745
they've been judged guilty
many times.

35:15.778 --> 35:18.214
You got the accuser
and the arresting officers,

35:18.248 --> 35:20.383
the detectives,
then a grand jury,

35:20.416 --> 35:21.717
then probable cause,

35:21.751 --> 35:24.855
we got all these mini-steps
along the way,

35:24.888 --> 35:29.292
each of them concluding
the same thing,

35:29.325 --> 35:31.862
the guy did it.

35:32.929 --> 35:34.597
And since the facts, you see,

35:35.798 --> 35:38.935
D.A.s,
they just wanna give a good,

35:38.969 --> 35:42.538
accurate presentation
of the facts.

35:46.142 --> 35:48.111
But defense lawyers...

35:50.213 --> 35:52.883
our job is to skew them.

35:53.549 --> 35:56.352
We stand up to distort, bend,

35:56.386 --> 35:58.254
hide the truth if necessary,

35:58.288 --> 36:01.164
and if you got a guilty guy,
which we usually do--what,

36:01.197 --> 36:04.534
we're gonna hope the jury
gets the right idea?

36:04.567 --> 36:09.305
My craft,
smoke and mirrors, deceit.

36:09.339 --> 36:10.740
Criminal defense attorneys
aren't about

36:10.773 --> 36:11.674
searching for the truth!

36:11.707 --> 36:12.808
Are you kidding?!

36:12.843 --> 36:14.810
Mr. Donnell!
DONNELL: That's our system!

36:14.845 --> 36:18.248
The D. A. has to prove guilt
beyond all reasonable doubt,

36:18.281 --> 36:20.616
and defense lawyer spews doubt,

36:20.650 --> 36:23.086
whenever, wherever,
with all the discipline

36:23.119 --> 36:24.687
that that perverted bastard

36:24.720 --> 36:26.789
probably spews semen
on his walls.

36:26.822 --> 36:27.657
Counsel!

36:27.690 --> 36:30.793
I like to finish
my closing argument.

36:30.826 --> 36:33.729
This man, I think he's guilty.

36:33.763 --> 36:35.565
I'm sure as hell
not supposed to say that,

36:35.598 --> 36:37.267
but I think he did it.

36:39.069 --> 36:40.670
The problem is...

36:44.440 --> 36:46.242
I can't be sure.

36:48.778 --> 36:49.980
Neither can you,

36:50.013 --> 36:54.050
because all we have
is one witness.

36:55.151 --> 36:56.252
Sympathetic?

36:56.286 --> 36:57.453
Definitely.

36:57.487 --> 37:00.363
Compelling? No doubt.

37:00.396 --> 37:02.298
But credible?

37:02.331 --> 37:04.200
His own mother waited two days
to call the police,

37:04.233 --> 37:06.502
because even she didn't believe
him at first.

37:06.535 --> 37:10.206
He has a history of leveling
false accusations,

37:10.239 --> 37:12.575
a history of lying and cheating,

37:12.608 --> 37:14.944
a track record of crying out
for attention,

37:14.978 --> 37:17.446
a history of drug use.

37:18.214 --> 37:19.382
The story itself changed

37:19.415 --> 37:22.118
with different statements
to the police.

37:22.152 --> 37:26.122
On the possibility
that Mitchell Orbis

37:26.156 --> 37:28.925
really did commit these crimes,

37:30.861 --> 37:32.728
I hope he goes away.

37:33.629 --> 37:35.531
But in this country,

37:35.565 --> 37:37.067
we don't take away
a man's freedom

37:37.100 --> 37:40.570
on the possibility of guilt,
or likelihood,

37:40.603 --> 37:44.540
even an overwhelmingly
strong likelihood.

37:44.574 --> 37:46.009
You have to find guilt

37:46.042 --> 37:49.545
beyond all reasonable doubt,

37:49.579 --> 37:51.247
and I'm sorry,

37:51.281 --> 37:53.149
you can't get there
with one lone witness,

37:53.183 --> 37:56.819
especially one whose word
lacks credibility.

37:56.853 --> 37:58.889
My client may be scum,

37:58.922 --> 38:01.197
but there is no real case
against him

38:01.231 --> 38:03.166
in this courtroom today,

38:03.199 --> 38:06.870
which means the heroes here

38:06.903 --> 38:08.939
have to be you.

38:08.972 --> 38:11.707
You have to go back
to that room,

38:11.741 --> 38:14.344
uphold your oath to our system,

38:14.377 --> 38:16.146
because if you don't...

38:20.183 --> 38:22.118
God forbid the day comes
when the only thing

38:22.152 --> 38:25.188
standing between our freedom
and a prison cell

38:25.221 --> 38:28.558
is the accusing finger
from a child who lies,

38:31.261 --> 38:34.197
because that's all we have here
today, ladies and gentlemen.

38:37.834 --> 38:40.570
One accusing finger

38:40.603 --> 38:45.441
from a child
who's been known to lie.

39:16.146 --> 39:19.015
Um, uh, could I have a second
in private, please?

39:26.189 --> 39:27.323
PATRICK: Bobby...

39:28.658 --> 39:31.194
the reason I felt
so violated by your decision

39:31.227 --> 39:34.264
to leave the church,

39:34.297 --> 39:36.900
you see, the church, to me,

39:36.933 --> 39:38.935
isn't an institution.

39:38.969 --> 39:42.472
It's not a cardinal
or the pope.

39:42.505 --> 39:46.409
It's first and foremost
my parish,

39:46.442 --> 39:47.510
the people.

39:48.711 --> 39:51.781
So, by your leaving,
it was, in some way...

39:54.217 --> 39:57.687
I understand that
you look to me for spiritual

39:57.720 --> 39:59.662
and moral leadership,

39:59.695 --> 40:03.666
and obviously,
I failed to provide it.

40:03.699 --> 40:07.270
But if I could retract
yesterday's condemnation

40:07.303 --> 40:10.706
and substitute it with some...

40:10.740 --> 40:12.943
guidance now,

40:13.776 --> 40:16.612
our criminal justice system,

40:16.646 --> 40:18.714
obviously we need
defense lawyers

40:18.748 --> 40:21.551
to do what they do,

40:21.584 --> 40:23.353
but, Bobby...

40:23.386 --> 40:26.890
from a spiritual
and moral standpoint...

40:29.692 --> 40:33.129
is this any way for a man
to live his life?

40:34.630 --> 40:36.032
(door opens)

40:36.066 --> 40:37.600
I'm sorry.

40:37.633 --> 40:39.569
You're not gonna believe this.

40:39.602 --> 40:41.271
Jury's coming back.

40:43.239 --> 40:47.177
(music playing)

41:10.974 --> 41:13.143
SWACKHEIM: Mr. Foreman...

41:13.176 --> 41:15.846
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

41:15.879 --> 41:16.746
We have, Your Honor.

41:16.779 --> 41:19.215
Will the defendant please rise?

41:21.417 --> 41:23.786
Mr. Foreman, what say you?

41:24.654 --> 41:26.289
"In the matter
of the Commonwealth

41:26.322 --> 41:28.358
versus Mitchell Orbis,

41:28.391 --> 41:30.460
on the count of statutory rape,

41:30.493 --> 41:33.596
sex with a minor,
we the jury,

41:33.629 --> 41:36.900
finding a strong
likelihood of guilt,

41:38.368 --> 41:41.905
regrettably return
a finding of not guilty."

41:41.938 --> 41:43.273
(indistinct chatter)

41:43.306 --> 41:44.674
SWACKHEIM: Members of the jury,

41:44.707 --> 41:46.309
this concludes your service.

41:47.043 --> 41:49.545
I caution you,
you will be subjected

41:49.579 --> 41:51.281
to inquiries from the press,

41:51.314 --> 41:53.616
seeking to explore
your decision.

41:54.550 --> 41:56.552
None of you are required

41:56.586 --> 41:58.754
to discuss this with the media.

41:58.788 --> 42:00.463
We are adjourned.

42:01.531 --> 42:04.300
The defendant is free to go.

42:04.334 --> 42:06.436
(gavel bangs)

42:06.469 --> 42:09.139
Thank you so much.

42:09.172 --> 42:10.406
Thank you.

42:13.143 --> 42:14.444
Thank you.

42:14.477 --> 42:18.414
(music playing)

43:00.230 --> 43:03.699
(music playing)

43:26.189 --> 43:27.790
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:27.823 --> 43:30.460
(music playing)
