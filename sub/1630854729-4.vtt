the office-sharing type.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.833
You can have this place.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.140
I'm gonna head down to
the solitary-confinement cell.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.056
Could probably get a lot of work
done before the madness sets in.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.364
-No, you don't have to do that.
This is my fault.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.801
I came on too strong.
I should be the one to go.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.846
-Yeah, it's not you.
It's me, really.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.893
I'm just uncomfortable
around people.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.851
-Makes it hard
to get to know you.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.288
-Why would you want
to get to know me?

18:35.331 --> 18:37.116
-'Cause I like you.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.814
I thought this office would be
a chance to bring us closer.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.424
But nothing was working.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.513
I got in my head,
and my heart was pounding.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.080
-And your mouth was doing things

18:45.124 --> 18:46.168
even though your brain
kept yelling, "Stop!"

18:46.212 --> 18:48.039
-Yes! I thought I was gonna die.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.998
-That's how I feel around
everyone all of the time!

18:50.041 --> 18:51.739
-Oh! We're bonding.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.176
-Are we work wives now?

18:54.220 --> 18:58.267
-Look at us, like two weird
ingredients in the perfect stew.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.703
Oh, no! My other stew!

18:59.747 --> 19:01.836
-No, no, no, it's okay.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.490
I turned it off for you.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.624
[ Laughter ]

19:09.235 --> 19:11.062
-So what do you say?

19:11.106 --> 19:12.412
Give this another chance?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.196
-On one condition.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.242
You explain to me
what Nakatomi Plaza is.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.201
-[ Gasps ]
I thought you'd never ask.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.030
When last we left
our young Die Hard,

19:22.073 --> 19:23.597
he was on a plane.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.120
[ Laughter ]

19:27.078 --> 19:29.211
-How'd it go?
Nope, not gonna ask.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.604
It's not my business
so I don't wanna know --

19:30.647 --> 19:32.083
-Nothing happened.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.477
-Thank you so much.
It was killing me.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.392
-Well, nothing in the way
that you're thinking,

19:36.436 --> 19:40.004
but very much in the way
that I had a minor breakdown

19:40.048 --> 19:41.528
and he tried to rob me.

19:41.571 --> 19:46.141
But I foiled her devious plan
by being too sad.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.535
-So, you gonna call her again?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.103
I'm sorry I got so involved.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.541
It's possible I may have been
living through you

19:54.584 --> 19:57.108
since my entire life
is upstate --

19:57.152 --> 20:00.416
my friends, my fiancé, my cow.

20:01.635 --> 20:04.333
-I know you paused after cow
wanting me to ask,

20:04.377 --> 20:06.814
but I never will.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.424
-That's too bad.
She's got a rough hide

20:08.468 --> 20:11.775
and a tender heart,
just like you.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.256
I just wanted you
to find somebody.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.954
Being alone seems kinda hard.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.826
-Sometimes.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.307
But you know what made it easier

20:21.350 --> 20:24.962
when she turned out
to be a sociopath?

20:25.006 --> 20:26.790
Knowing that if
I ever do want to talk,

20:26.834 --> 20:28.314
and I'm not saying
that I ever will,

20:28.357 --> 20:31.404
but if I ever did,
I could imagine a possible,

20:31.447 --> 20:34.276
though veryunlikely scenario,

20:34.320 --> 20:38.585
where I might choose
to talk...to you.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.631
-Mm-hmm.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.067
-You may react.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.982
-Eee!
-Oh, don't.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.638
-Oh! I can't wait to dig in.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.205
Okay, first up -- childhood.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.425
Who's love did you crave,
your mom's or your dad's?

20:52.468 --> 20:57.081
-To be clear, this is happening
notime soon.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.345
-I'm getting dad.
-He was a very complicated ma--

20:59.388 --> 21:02.609
No! For right now,
we are just two people

21:02.652 --> 21:04.175
who get to hate

21:04.219 --> 21:07.004
all of the un-lonely people
around us.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.268
-Yeah, like those two.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.834
Jerks.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.923
So annoying.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.752
Being all happy.
-Yuck.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.798
It made you feel bad
saying that, didn't it?

21:17.841 --> 21:19.626
-Yeah, but I want us to have
a thing.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.497
-Ah.
