12:35.379 --> 12:36.255
{\an1}outfit moves.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.131
{\an1}And he starts laughing a little

12:37.214 --> 12:37.923
{\an1}bit.

12:38.007 --> 12:38.507
{\an1}My sparkles were around his

12:38.591 --> 12:40.259
{\an1}head.

12:40.342 --> 12:40.926
{\an1}And it's all good.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.386
{\an1}"You know what, girl? Just go."

12:42.470 --> 12:43.846
{\an1}And I get backstage.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.055
{\an1}Whatever was going on with the

12:45.139 --> 12:47.057
{\an1}cookie like scared me a little

12:47.141 --> 12:47.224
{\an1}bit.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.185
{\an1}There's this clan of girls, and

12:49.268 --> 12:52.396
{\an1}they had these box hats on and

12:52.480 --> 12:54.148
{\an1}like very fierce looking.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.274
{\an1}I go up to these women, and I'm

12:55.357 --> 12:57.818
{\an1}like, "Who can I, um, speak to

12:57.902 --> 12:58.486
{\an1}here?"

12:58.569 --> 13:00.279
{\an1}And they're like nothing, done,

13:00.362 --> 13:01.113
{\an1}brick wall.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.156
{\an1}Like not friends.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.282
{\an1}Not here for it.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.035
{\an1}So I kinda like split the ocean

13:06.118 --> 13:06.702
{\an1}with my dress, walked up the

13:06.785 --> 13:09.163
{\an1}stairs.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.206
{\an1}This woman is wearing this

13:10.289 --> 13:11.499
{\an1}microphone.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.042
{\an1}And she's rushing people.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.168
{\an1}And she sees me and looks me up

13:14.251 --> 13:14.710
{\an1}head to toe and thinks I'm

13:14.793 --> 13:17.880
{\an1}performing and is like,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.507
{\an1}"Are you up?"

13:19.590 --> 13:20.758
{\an1}And I'm like, "Yes, I am."

13:20.841 --> 13:23.093
{\an1}I get up on stage, and I'm like

13:23.177 --> 13:24.637
{\an1}looking around.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.013
{\an1}Literally sparkles everywhere,

13:26.096 --> 13:28.224
{\an1}internally and externally.

13:28.307 --> 13:28.807
{\an1}So this confidence cookie was

13:28.891 --> 13:31.435
{\an1}also like "you're the best

13:31.519 --> 13:33.562
{\an1}dancer in the world" cookie.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.940
{\an1}I'm falling back to the music so

13:36.023 --> 13:37.233
{\an1}hard.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.442
{\an1}I'm like, "Oh my"--like the song

13:38.526 --> 13:38.817
{\an1}was on point.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.487
{\an1}Going back and forth on stage

13:41.570 --> 13:41.946
{\an1}with all this fabric.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.198
{\an1}And I hear people yelling at me.

13:44.281 --> 13:44.823
{\an1}And I come to.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.783
{\an1}And they're like, "Come.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.576
{\an1}Come over."

13:47.660 --> 13:49.286
{\an1}I'm like, "Oh no, am I in

13:49.370 --> 13:49.995
{\an1}trouble?"

13:50.079 --> 13:50.579
{\an1}They're like, "Oh no, you did

13:50.663 --> 13:51.497
{\an1}"great.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.957
{\an1}"But you were on stage for like

13:53.040 --> 13:53.958
{\an1}really long."

13:54.041 --> 13:55.167
{\an1}The bouncer, this super serious

13:55.251 --> 13:57.461
{\an1}guy, who I changed from like a

13:57.545 --> 14:00.381
{\an1}reptile to a fairy gave me like

14:00.464 --> 14:02.174
{\an1}a bro high-five.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.135
{\an1}I was so happy that all the

14:05.219 --> 14:06.470
{\an1}effort I put into designing my

14:06.554 --> 14:09.431
{\an1}outfit actually got exposed in

14:09.515 --> 14:10.724
{\an1}the fashion show.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.226
{\an1}Then the sun came out, and like

14:12.309 --> 14:14.061
{\an1}all the fairies were there.

{\an1}Also known as Young Flu or the

{\an1}Flu.

14:23.779 --> 14:24.321
{\an1}And this is my story about how I

14:24.405 --> 14:26.991
{\an1}invited all my ex-girlfriends to

14:27.074 --> 14:28.409
{\an1}the same party.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.618
{\an1}So it's my birthday, right?

14:29.702 --> 14:30.411
{\an1}And I just wanna have a little

14:30.494 --> 14:31.078
{\an1}fun.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.288
{\an1}My friends come up to me.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.122
{\an1}They're like, "We got this crazy

{\an1}"Let's invite all your

14:37.793 --> 14:38.586
{\an1}"Uh, I don't know about that,

14:38.669 --> 14:39.336
{\an1}"bro.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.629
{\an1}You know I have a woman."

14:40.713 --> 14:41.672
{\an1}And they're like, "Oh, come on,

14:41.755 --> 14:42.172
{\an1}bro, don't be a bitch."

14:42.256 --> 14:43.757
{\an1}Once that challenge is put out

14:43.841 --> 14:44.717
{\an1}there, it's against the bros'

14:44.800 --> 14:46.427
{\an1}code to even, you know--excuse

14:46.510 --> 14:47.928
{\an1}my language--to bitch up.

14:48.012 --> 14:48.846
{\an1}So I'm like, "You know what?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.265
{\an1}[bleep] I'm doing it."

14:51.348 --> 14:52.433
{\an1}This is very important to me

14:52.516 --> 14:53.350
{\an1}that we pull this off right,

14:53.434 --> 14:54.476
{\an1}because I'm jeopardizing my

14:54.560 --> 14:55.686
{\an1}relationship to do this.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.729
{\an1}My girlfriend Dominque, she

14:56.812 --> 14:58.105
{\an1}usually works on Fridays.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.481
{\an1}And the party's on Friday.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.108
{\an1}So I felt like I had it, you

15:01.191 --> 15:02.484
{\an1}know, under control.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.527
{\an1}So I invited 15 girls.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.528
{\an1}We got nine girls to come.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.613
{\an1}And it took--it wasn't easy at

15:05.696 --> 15:06.363
{\an1}all.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.197
{\an1}I had to call each of 'em.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.574
{\an1}And I had the guys help me, too.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.950
{\an1}And we had to genuinely convince

15:10.034 --> 15:10.951
{\an1}each of these girls that it was

15:11.035 --> 15:11.535
{\an1}just a regular party, not that

15:11.619 --> 15:12.786
{\an1}it was gonna be an ex-girlfriend

15:12.870 --> 15:13.704
{\an1}party.

15:13.787 --> 15:14.413
{\an1}Of course they couldn't know

15:14.496 --> 15:15.039
{\an1}that.

15:15.122 --> 15:15.581
{\an1}And so we're sitting there

15:15.664 --> 15:16.290
{\an1}waiting.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.333
{\an1}First arrival is Alicia.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.542
{\an1}You want real names or nickname?

15:22.087 --> 15:22.504
{\an1}>> Okay, we had Squeeze.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.547
{\an1}"Knock, knock."

15:23.631 --> 15:25.215
{\an1}Second chick, Lorel.

15:25.299 --> 15:25.674
{\an1}"Knock, knock, knock."

15:25.758 --> 15:27.509
{\an1}Third chick, Brittany.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.177
{\an1}We're talking about an

15:28.260 --> 15:28.594
{\an1}ex-girlfriend party.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.054
{\an1}This thing is going down.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.472
{\an1}So I got nine ex-girlfriends

15:31.555 --> 15:32.514
{\an1}over to my house.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.766
{\an1}And I'm drunk.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.767
{\an1}I'm just soaking it all in,

15:34.850 --> 15:35.434
{\an1}living in the moment.

15:35.517 --> 15:36.101
{\an1}I'm working the crowd.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.061
{\an1}I'm talking to this chick.

15:37.144 --> 15:37.519
{\an1}Talking to that chick.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.063
{\an1}"Hey, how you doing, baby?"

15:39.146 --> 15:40.689
{\an1}"Oh, hey, I'm so happy to be."

15:40.773 --> 15:41.440
{\an1}You know, and then I've got

15:41.523 --> 15:42.483
{\an1}other chicks who are not as

15:42.566 --> 15:43.108
{\an1}happy to be there.

15:43.192 --> 15:43.692
{\an1}They had a little cat fight.

15:43.776 --> 15:44.693
{\an1}It didn't get too serious

15:44.777 --> 15:45.486
{\an1}though.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.320
{\an1}And I kinda kept looking at the

15:46.403 --> 15:47.821
{\an1}door wondering if Dominque would

15:47.905 --> 15:49.031
{\an1}pop up.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.574
{\an1}But, I mean, at the same time, I

15:50.658 --> 15:51.617
{\an1}was drunk.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.242
{\an1}Man, chicks giving lap

15:52.326 --> 15:53.202
{\an1}dances, everything.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.495
{\an1}Got lemon pepper chicken.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.413
{\an1}All of the sudden, I look up,

15:56.497 --> 15:58.749
{\an1}and I see my girlfriend walk in.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.334
{\an1}And her mom came in right behind

16:00.417 --> 16:01.001
{\an1}her.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.461
{\an1}She starts going completely

16:02.544 --> 16:03.128
{\an1}crazy.

16:03.212 --> 16:03.754
{\an1}I mean, she's throwing at every

16:03.837 --> 16:04.546
{\an1}chick.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.631
{\an1}She's throwing stuff.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.257
{\an1}She ready to fight everybody.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.509
{\an1}The girls are pretty much flying

16:08.592 --> 16:09.134
{\an1}out of the house.

16:09.218 --> 16:09.760
{\an1}Everybody's running every which

16:09.843 --> 16:10.511
{\an1}way.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.261
{\an1}They're leaving out the front

16:11.345 --> 16:12.513
{\an1}door, out the window.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.305
{\an1}Her own mom couldn't even calm

16:13.389 --> 16:14.390
{\an1}her down or try to stop her, so

16:14.473 --> 16:15.307
{\an1}you know I'm not about to even

16:15.391 --> 16:16.767
{\an1}try to say or do nothing.

16:16.850 --> 16:17.434
{\an1}I'm hoping she don't even look

16:17.518 --> 16:18.352
{\an1}my way.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.103
{\an1}The party's over.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.020
{\an1}Even my homies are like,

16:20.104 --> 16:20.854
{\an1}"Yo, you trippin', bro.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.106
{\an1}We out."

16:22.189 --> 16:23.065
{\an1}And pretty much we're just left

16:23.148 --> 16:25.567
{\an1}with me, her, and her mom.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.111
{\an1}Uh...I kinda thought about it,

16:27.194 --> 16:27.945
{\an1}like maybe this--maybe this

16:28.028 --> 16:30.406

{\an1}He looks over at me.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.898
{\an1}He kind of sees me.

17:45.981 --> 17:46.690
{\an1}At that moment, I'm like, "This

17:46.774 --> 17:47.816
{\an1}is do or die," you know?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.067
{\an1}I'm like...just trying to look

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
{\an1}cool.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.780
{\an1}He looks at me, and he's like...

17:52.863 --> 17:53.864
{\an1}And then he moves on.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.324
{\an1}And so I'm good!

17:55.407 --> 17:56.742
{\an1}I got the acknowledgement from

17:56.825 --> 17:57.451
{\an1}Billy.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.702
{\an1}The bass is going.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.078
{\an1}And everybody's out there.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.874
{\an1}And then there's a very loud--

18:03.957 --> 18:05.250
{\an1}>> [loud crack]

18:05.334 --> 18:07.461
{\an1}>> --like shrieky crack sort of

18:07.544 --> 18:07.669
{\an1}sound.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.170
{\an1}And everyone kind of like

18:08.253 --> 18:09.004
{\an1}stopped for a second like,

18:09.087 --> 18:10.130
{\an1}"[bleep] was that?"

18:10.214 --> 18:11.924
{\an1}Nothing happened.

18:12.007 --> 18:12.716
{\an1}So people go back to their

18:12.800 --> 18:13.383
{\an1}partying.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.676
{\an1}And then there's these even

18:14.760 --> 18:16.345
{\an1}louder crack. Just--

18:16.428 --> 18:16.595
{\an1}>> [crack]

18:16.678 --> 18:18.680
{\an1}>> And the deck shifts.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.223
{\an1}There's a moment of silence.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.600
{\an1}People are looking around.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.392
{\an1}They go back to doing their

18:22.476 --> 18:23.477
{\an1}thing.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.604
{\an1}And then it happens.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.148
{\an1}>> [loud cracking]

18:28.232 --> 18:30.984
{\an1}>> And the whole side of the

18:31.068 --> 18:33.821
{\an1}deck breaks and caves in.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.531
{\an1}And everybody just falls.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.366
{\an1}I fell straight down, landed in

18:37.449 --> 18:38.283
{\an1}the mud.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.243
{\an1}And everybody on this side of

18:39.326 --> 18:40.702
{\an1}the deck just slowly starts

18:40.786 --> 18:41.787
{\an1}sliding down.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.621
{\an1}And they're screaming.

18:42.704 --> 18:43.705
{\an1}And there's girls trying to grab

18:43.789 --> 18:44.790
{\an1}onto the side.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.416
{\an1}The subwoofers are sliding down

18:46.500 --> 18:47.751
{\an1}the deck, hitting people.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.253
{\an1}And there's an army of ping pong

18:49.336 --> 18:50.212
{\an1}balls hitting people.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.046
{\an1}I'm on the ground, I'm looking

18:51.129 --> 18:53.590
{\an1}up at all these people just

18:53.674 --> 18:54.758
{\an1}sliding down.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.302
{\an1}And I see big Billy just

18:57.386 --> 19:00.013
{\an1}barreling towards me, falling.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.431
{\an1}And he grabs onto the side.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.057
{\an1}And he's like hanging for a

19:02.140 --> 19:02.266
{\an1}second.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.893
{\an1}And then I see this mini-frig.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.727
{\an1}"No.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.603
{\an1}"No, this is not gonna happen.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.312
{\an1}Not Billy."

19:07.396 --> 19:08.438
{\an1}And this mini-frig just takes

19:08.522 --> 19:09.273
{\an1}Billy out.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.607
{\an1}And Billy goes flying past me,

19:10.691 --> 19:12.359
{\an1}just "Ah!"

19:12.442 --> 19:14.570
{\an1}Oh my God, this is insane.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.821
{\an1}But, you know, then I realize

19:15.904 --> 19:16.363
{\an1}everybody's just basically

19:16.446 --> 19:18.782
{\an1}landing exactly where I'm at in

19:18.866 --> 19:20.033
{\an1}a pile of mud.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.410
{\an1}People sort of looked around and

19:21.493 --> 19:22.452
{\an1}everyone can breathe again.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.829
{\an1}It's like, "Uh, okay, we're

19:23.912 --> 19:24.746
{\an1}"good.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}"We're alive.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.081
{\an1}"Now let's go get a beer!

19:26.164 --> 19:28.000
{\an1}"Let's do a beer bong!

19:28.083 --> 19:29.001
{\an1}"Let's go up and have sex in

19:29.084 --> 19:30.502
{\an1}their parents' room."

19:30.586 --> 19:31.461
{\an1}The rager kept happening.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.547
{\an1}But for me--for little Josh

19:33.630 --> 19:36.425
{\an1}Gordon--can I say my last name?

19:36.508 --> 19:37.968
{\an1}But for me, for little Josh,

19:38.051 --> 19:38.844
{\an1}like that was it.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.511
{\an1}I was done.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.345
{\an1}I had experienced enough for the

19:40.429 --> 19:41.430
{\an1}night.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.015
{\an1}And I was gonna go pass out in

19:43.098 --> 19:43.348
{\an1}Vincent's car.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.435
{\an1}And that's exactly what I did.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.352
{\an1}We woke up, and there were still

19:47.436 --> 19:48.896
{\an1}people at the house.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.938
{\an1}Some people were still like

19:50.022 --> 19:51.398
{\an1}doing beer bongs.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.107
{\an1}Some girls were still giving lap

19:52.190 --> 19:53.483
{\an1}dances.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.985
{\an1}And the owner--the kid owner of

19:55.068 --> 19:56.153
{\an1}the house came down the stairs.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.279
{\an1}Mind you, he had passed out at

19:57.362 --> 19:59.573
{\an1}like 10 o'clock.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.407
{\an1}He goes to the sliding glass

20:00.490 --> 20:02.784
{\an1}door, out to the patio.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.661
{\an1}He opens the sliding glass door.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.704
{\an1}And everybody's just like, "No,

20:05.787 --> 20:06.788
{\an1}no, no, no!"

20:06.872 --> 20:08.999
{\an1}And he falls a story down.

20:09.082 --> 20:09.750
{\an1}And everyone's just like,

20:09.833 --> 20:11.668
{\an1}"Oh, no, no, no!

20:11.752 --> 20:12.461
{\an1}My God!"

20:12.544 --> 20:13.503
{\an1}He was fine though.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.880
{\an1}It was crazy.

20:14.963 --> 20:15.839
{\an1}Like I was either gonna go into

20:15.923 --> 20:19.051
{\an1}this party and leave awesome, or

20:19.134 --> 20:20.594
{\an1}I was just gonna never gonna be

20:20.677 --> 20:21.553
{\an1}able to get in again.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.847
{\an1}And, uh, I later on did become

20:23.931 --> 20:24.681
{\an1}pretty cool.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.807
{\an1}I was actually nominated for

20:25.891 --> 20:26.934
{\an1}homecoming king.

20:27.017 --> 20:27.267
