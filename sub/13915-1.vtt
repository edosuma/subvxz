00:23.409 --> 00:26.155
WELCOME TO PICO MUNDO

00:26.190 --> 00:27.244
My name is Odd Thomas.

00:27.279 --> 00:31.029
Though in this age when fame is the
altar at which most people worship.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.537
I'm not sure why you should care.

00:32.572 --> 00:34.988
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not the child of a celebrity.

00:35.023 --> 00:36.777
I've never been married to,
abused by,

00:36.812 --> 00:38.530
or provided a kidney to a celebrity.

00:38.565 --> 00:39.858
Green Moon Bowling

00:42.572 --> 00:46.020
But I do lead an unusual life.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.605
Penny Kalisto.

01:05.615 --> 01:08.080
My name really is Odd.

01:08.115 --> 01:11.488
According to my mother, it was
a screw-up on my birth certificate.

01:11.523 --> 01:14.861
She says I was supposed to be called
Todd, after a Lithuanian uncle.

01:15.282 --> 01:17.539
My father insists my name
was always Odd...

01:17.574 --> 01:20.821
and he notes that all of
my uncles are Bulgarian.

01:21.324 --> 01:24.091
My father claims
my mother is insane.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.860
My mother, of course,
begs to differ.

01:27.575 --> 01:32.777
My abilities are a gift from God!

01:33.533 --> 01:35.489
My father won that argument.

01:36.742 --> 01:40.403
I was 12 years old when they finally
locked her up and threw away the key.

01:45.409 --> 01:49.569
I've come to believe that
my mother and I share certain...

01:49.659 --> 01:51.082
abilities.

01:51.117 --> 01:53.826
Since I don't want to be locked up
with the key thrown away...

01:53.861 --> 01:57.985
I've pretty much kept mine a secret.

02:05.909 --> 02:07.368
Odd Thomas.

02:07.403 --> 02:08.792
Hello, Harlo.

02:08.827 --> 02:10.375
Long time, no see.

02:10.410 --> 02:13.327
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Come on, man. No touchy, no feely.

02:13.362 --> 02:16.401
- Sorry, but I love this car.
- I know.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.440
It's too bad a car
can't love you back.

02:22.077 --> 02:24.304
What's wrong, Odd?
There anything I can do?

02:24.339 --> 02:26.531
No, it's something
you've already done.

02:27.369 --> 02:29.509
Hey! Hey! Come on- oh, Odd.
No fooling around, man.

02:29.544 --> 02:31.650
- Give me my keys.
- Her blood is in your pocket.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.866
Most people would think
that's a weird thing to say...

02:35.901 --> 02:38.113
but you don't think
it's very weird, do you, Harlo?

02:44.995 --> 02:46.239
On that night...

02:47.704 --> 02:50.204
you took a piece of white felt...

02:50.239 --> 02:52.127
and after killing Penny...

02:52.162 --> 02:54.870
you collected some of her blood.

02:54.905 --> 02:56.919
And now it's dry...

02:56.954 --> 03:00.700
and stiff and
brittle like a cracker...

03:01.538 --> 03:05.283
and it's still in your pocket.

03:12.996 --> 03:15.705
In moments like these,
pity tears at me.

03:15.740 --> 03:18.379
And a kind of madness
comes over me...

03:18.414 --> 03:21.122
forcing me to hunt people
like Harlo Landerson...

03:21.157 --> 03:25.068
who I have no pity for whatsoever.

03:42.373 --> 03:44.448
Sorry, Mrs. Curtees!

03:46.332 --> 03:47.908
Sorry, Saleen!

04:21.250 --> 04:23.000
What the hell are you doing?

04:23.035 --> 04:25.205
Mom, what's going on?

04:29.459 --> 04:31.331
Stevie, run honey, run!

04:39.876 --> 04:40.906
Come here!

04:49.793 --> 04:52.496
My life is filled with guys
like Harlo Landerson.

04:55.835 --> 04:58.122
And since I like my face
just the way it is...

04:59.378 --> 05:01.036
I learned how to handle myself.

05:17.795 --> 05:22.287
I may see dead people, but then,
by God, I do something about it.

05:23.129 --> 05:24.969
Hey. Hey!

05:25.004 --> 05:26.927
Shift down, man! Go easy.

05:26.962 --> 05:29.877
I'm sorry, sir,
but I don't have a "go easy" gear.

05:31.046 --> 05:32.796
You should probably get that looked at.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.345
Now, Officer Eckles...

05:34.380 --> 05:35.470
does being a police officer

05:35.505 --> 05:37.171
give you the right to beat
the shit out of people?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.803
Not at all, Officer Varner.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.828
But it is one of
the perks of the job.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.039
I believe in a higher power
and the afterlife.

05:52.713 --> 05:54.586
Call me strange.

05:55.631 --> 05:56.845
Others do.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.752
He's so strange.

06:01.131 --> 06:02.471
Don't worry, Penny.

06:02.506 --> 06:05.922
I think where you're going
is a home for the spirit...

06:05.957 --> 06:09.585
and it's filled with
kindness and wonder.

06:10.714 --> 06:12.587
I'm sorry, Penny.

06:13.131 --> 06:15.702
I'm sorry your life was so short.

06:26.257 --> 06:27.915
The dead don't talk.

06:28.757 --> 06:30.831
I don't know why.

06:35.425 --> 06:36.722
Here we are again.

06:36.757 --> 06:40.005
Busted furniture and
shattered glass everywhere.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.015
Most of it was not my fault.

06:44.050 --> 06:47.446
Except the panda bear lamp
and the Biffy the Clown mirror.

06:47.481 --> 06:50.806
- That was this guy.
- Why didn't you come to me first..

06:50.841 --> 06:54.675
give me a chance to find a way
to get Harlo to entrap himself?

06:54.710 --> 06:55.807
Whenever we do it that way,

06:55.842 --> 06:57.967
it's always more efficient
and less destructive.

06:58.002 --> 07:00.092
Yes, I know but he had
to be stopped right now...

07:00.127 --> 07:02.297
or he was gonna do it again soon.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.510
That's what Penny wanted to tell me.
That's why she hadn't left yet.

07:05.545 --> 07:08.957
Son, you so complicate my life.

07:11.759 --> 07:13.003
Look.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.891
Besides her blood...

07:15.926 --> 07:19.885
Harlo had these photos of Penny
post-mortem in his wallet.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.673
If there's any fuss about
how you pegged Harlo...

07:22.708 --> 07:25.427
just say he opened up
his wallet to pay off a bet.

07:25.462 --> 07:28.219
Five bucks on
yesterday's Dodger's game...

07:28.254 --> 07:30.377
the photos fell out,
you saw em-

07:30.412 --> 07:32.500
He ran and naturally,
I gave chase.

07:33.136 --> 07:34.380
Naturally.

08:24.389 --> 08:28.076
Save me!

08:28.111 --> 08:31.729
Save us!

08:31.764 --> 08:33.701
- Save
- Us!

08:33.736 --> 08:35.623
- Save..
- Us!

08:35.658 --> 08:37.510
Save you from who?

08:40.097 --> 08:41.342
Who is that?

08:42.390 --> 08:43.763
Who is it?

09:21.558 --> 09:23.134
Evil is coming.

09:23.641 --> 09:26.889
And it's up to me to figure out
who's gonna be holding the gun.

09:27.933 --> 09:29.391
Morning, Elvis.

09:30.226 --> 09:31.107
Pico Mundo Grill
CLOSED

09:31.142 --> 09:32.774
So much of my life
is out of my controI.

09:32.809 --> 09:36.351
I would have gone 7 kinds of
crazy if I hadn't simplified.

09:36.386 --> 09:40.018
So I have no motorized vehicles,
no homeownership...

09:40.053 --> 09:43.018
no insurance,
and no grand ambitions.

09:43.053 --> 09:44.179
Ladies.

09:44.601 --> 09:46.108
Eggs! Wreck em and stretch em!

09:46.143 --> 09:48.768
"Wreck em" means scrambled,
and "stretch em" means...

09:48.803 --> 09:49.983
add an extra egg.

09:50.018 --> 09:51.441
Cardiac shingles and hash browns!

09:51.476 --> 09:54.601
"Cardiac shingles"
are toast with lots of butter.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.328
And hash browns...

09:56.363 --> 09:57.984
are just hash browns.

09:58.019 --> 10:00.720
Not every word
we use is diner lingo.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.608
Just as not every short-order cook

10:03.643 --> 10:07.811
is an undercover detective
for dead people.

10:07.846 --> 10:09.268
Duck.

10:15.311 --> 10:18.609
That is Stormy Lewellyn.

10:18.644 --> 10:23.137
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.477
GYPSY MUMMY ALL SEEING EYE

10:27.394 --> 10:31.554
You are destined
to be together forever.

10:34.478 --> 10:37.098
Hey, Chief.
Tummy Tickler coming at ya.

10:41.146 --> 10:43.562
You know, I'm still not happy
about what you did yesterday, Oddie.

10:43.597 --> 10:44.813
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

10:44.848 --> 10:47.486
I am not afraid of death.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.010
Of course, I'm not ready to go
on a date with him, either.

10:56.479 --> 10:58.147
Would you throw yourself
off a cliff for me?

10:58.182 --> 10:59.029
Of course I would.

10:59.064 --> 11:01.897
Into a river of razor blades
and lemon juice?

11:01.932 --> 11:03.112
Absolutely.

11:03.147 --> 11:05.522
Of course, I'd like to know
the reasoning behind such a request..

11:05.557 --> 11:07.570
but, fortunately for me...

11:07.605 --> 11:10.939
you reek of intelligence
and integrity.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.231
And you reek of peach shampoo.

11:13.266 --> 11:15.636
Just the way I like you.

11:16.898 --> 11:19.030
- Chief.
- Morning, Stormy.

11:19.065 --> 11:21.356
What's with
the cat-ate-the-canary smile?

11:21.391 --> 11:23.229
Tonight is date night.

11:23.981 --> 11:26.268
So you think you're
gonna get yourself some, huh?

11:26.565 --> 11:29.606
- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
- Stormy SpeciaI.

11:29.641 --> 11:31.681
- Girlfriend.
- Morning, dude.

11:49.607 --> 11:51.240
I call them bodachs.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.906
Well, not to their faces, I hope.

11:52.941 --> 11:55.311
I never met anybody
that could see em before.

11:55.524 --> 11:58.234
- Neither have I.
- Everyone told me it's in my head.

11:58.269 --> 11:59.817
Well, you should stop
telling everyone.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.448
I tried telling my parents.

12:01.483 --> 12:03.025
If I told my parents,
I'd ve spent my whole life...

12:03.060 --> 12:04.916
picking winning lottery numbers.

12:04.951 --> 12:06.772
You can pick winning lotto numbers?

12:07.192 --> 12:10.026
- No, I can't. Stay on point.
- Right. Yeah.

12:10.061 --> 12:13.151
Yesterday, when I finally saw one...

12:13.186 --> 12:15.317
I gave him the finger, Homes.

12:15.352 --> 12:16.741
Don't you know?

12:16.776 --> 12:20.307
If they find out you can see them,
they will kill you.

12:26.985 --> 12:28.561
They will kill you.

13:04.695 --> 13:06.326
- Little advice?
- Yeah?

13:06.361 --> 13:08.327
Karla prefers chocolate to flowers

13:08.362 --> 13:10.862
and you should get
yourself some candles.

13:10.897 --> 13:11.892
Candles?

13:12.403 --> 13:13.980
Thanks. Good idea.

13:19.612 --> 13:21.244
Whew, close.

13:21.279 --> 13:22.946
That would have been
a little awkward.

13:22.981 --> 13:25.400
You two are really something.

13:25.435 --> 13:27.786
I don't know what, but something.

13:27.821 --> 13:30.321
We're weird and screwed up
but we're okay.

13:30.356 --> 13:31.565
I don't know.

13:31.780 --> 13:33.237
You are...

13:34.405 --> 13:35.703
so cool.

13:35.738 --> 13:39.405
So, you deny me my weirdness,
but agree that I'm screwed up?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.037
You're right.
I see your problem.

13:41.072 --> 13:43.363
Weirdness, it can be fun.
It can be kind of cooI.

13:43.398 --> 13:47.114
Screwed-up-ness, not so much.

13:47.149 --> 13:49.899
You are quite weird.

13:51.489 --> 13:54.698
- Apology accepted.
- I gotta go. Be good, you two.

13:54.733 --> 13:57.322
It's not me you have to worry about.

13:57.357 --> 13:58.650
Don't I know it.

13:59.281 --> 14:01.490
I gotta go to work, too, Oddie.

14:01.525 --> 14:03.776
- Okay.
- Later, my love.

14:14.490 --> 14:15.652
Stormy!

14:24.407 --> 14:26.149
Miss you already.

14:31.075 --> 14:32.825
- Living up to his name.
- Every damn day.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.069
Later.

14:34.491 --> 14:38.241
Months often pass
when I don't see a single bodach.

14:38.276 --> 14:39.165
When they do show up...

14:39.200 --> 14:42.325
it's a sure sign that carnage
and bloodshed are not far behind.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.207
Morning.

14:43.242 --> 14:45.446
They don't cause it.
They feed on it.

14:46.076 --> 14:49.690
The more bodachs that show up,
the bigger the eventuaI feast.

14:52.117 --> 14:54.617
They're attracted to evil
like bees to flowers.

14:54.652 --> 14:57.117
They know when death is coming
and want to watch.

14:57.152 --> 14:59.458
They don't show up
for any ordinary death.

14:59.493 --> 15:03.783
They want extreme,
operatic violence and terror.

15:05.952 --> 15:08.869
Penny Kalisto's death
wasn't horrific enough...

15:08.904 --> 15:12.613
to bring a single bodach
into our world.

15:16.078 --> 15:19.277
This town is in serious trouble.

15:20.452 --> 15:22.536
- Bye, Oddie.
- See you, ladies.

15:22.571 --> 15:24.408
Nicolina! Levanna!

15:28.244 --> 15:30.947
Odd, am I really sucking
at this whole "mother" thing?

15:32.411 --> 15:34.460
Well, considering their
last one was a junkie...

15:34.495 --> 15:37.119
who left them in your lap
when you were barely 18...

15:37.154 --> 15:40.745
I think you rather rock, Vi.

15:40.780 --> 15:41.775
See you later.

15:42.328 --> 15:44.252
I'm heading this way, too.

15:44.287 --> 15:46.641
Gonna go see Madame Pearl,
get myself read.

15:46.676 --> 15:48.961
Personally,
I don't believe people who say...

15:48.996 --> 15:52.120
they can read minds or palms
and, trust me, tea leaves...

15:52.155 --> 15:53.836
just cloggage
in the garbage disposal.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.913
It's just I had this dream
last night you would not believe.

15:56.948 --> 16:00.663
Well, anything short of
a 9-alarm massacre, I can top.

16:00.698 --> 16:03.365
I'd never seen myself face-on
in a dream before.

16:04.705 --> 16:06.128
You saw your own face?

16:06.163 --> 16:09.705
Me and this guy, we were
both lying dead all busted up...

16:09.740 --> 16:12.407
like we'd been shot
to pieces or something.

16:17.622 --> 16:19.796
You know, I wouldn't worry
about it, Vi.

16:19.831 --> 16:21.905
I mean, have any of
your dreams ever come true?

16:22.831 --> 16:23.993
No.

16:24.622 --> 16:27.331
I know most people think
you're just quirky or weird, Odd...

16:27.366 --> 16:29.414
except Stormy who thinks
angels fly out of your butt.

16:29.449 --> 16:31.164
But I know there's more to it.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.713
You have a secret.

16:32.748 --> 16:34.671
You're either a clairvoyant...

16:34.706 --> 16:36.964
a psychic, a seer,
a soothsayer, or something.

16:36.999 --> 16:39.206
Or you got yourself some juice
with a higher power.

16:39.241 --> 16:40.088
And I need to know.

16:40.123 --> 16:41.996
Tell me the truth now, Odd.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.906
Do you see death in me?

16:48.165 --> 16:52.624
No. No, all I see
is my own insensitivity...

16:52.659 --> 16:56.072
and a long,
happy life for you, okay?

16:59.916 --> 17:03.661
Hey, Vi, the the dead guy
in your dream, what was he wearing?

17:04.415 --> 17:06.374
Wearing? I don't know.

17:06.409 --> 17:08.632
Oh! Wait. Yeah...

17:08.666 --> 17:13.157
a red and black shirt with
black bowling balls on it.

17:19.916 --> 17:22.959
One of my stranger abilities is
that when I need to find someone...

17:22.992 --> 17:25.507
like right now, the creepy
guy in the diner,

17:25.541 --> 17:29.501
I can randomly wander around, and
pretty quickly, I'll run into him.

17:29.536 --> 17:31.907
This is a talent for
which I have no name.

17:32.209 --> 17:35.126
Stormy calls it psychic magnetism.

17:35.161 --> 17:37.717
TIRE WORLD
Super Summer Sale

17:37.752 --> 17:40.633
That's Tom Jedd.
He was my little league coach.

17:40.668 --> 17:44.835
Been hanging around Tire World for
years, although I don't know why.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.210
His death was not caused
by a defective tire.

17:47.245 --> 17:50.955
Such a beautifuI girl-

17:56.794 --> 18:00.461
There is something about
a dead man trying to get a laugh...

18:00.496 --> 18:02.535
that just bugs me.

18:03.586 --> 18:06.919
Perhaps because it suggests
that even in death...

18:06.954 --> 18:09.835
we still have a pathetic
need to be liked.

18:10.044 --> 18:14.418
As well as the ever-present
ability to humiliate ourselves.

18:17.211 --> 18:18.788
Where are you?

18:20.337 --> 18:22.624
Where are you?

18:26.379 --> 18:27.327
MANAGER Stormy

18:32.755 --> 18:36.588
When I finally have my own shop,
no stupid uniforms.

18:36.623 --> 18:39.088
I think you look adorable.

18:39.123 --> 18:41.038
Adorable? Really?

18:41.073 --> 18:42.953
Puppies are adorable.

18:44.004 --> 18:46.817
Why are you here so early?
You missing me?

18:46.852 --> 18:49.630
Always.
But I'm here looking for a guy.

18:49.665 --> 18:50.429
A creepy guy.

18:50.464 --> 18:54.214
Well, with you,
there can be no other kind.

18:54.249 --> 18:57.745
My psychic magnetism
brought me here.

19:04.423 --> 19:07.337
- That guy?
- That guy.

19:08.465 --> 19:10.715
You are better than a bloodhound.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.964
What is that thing on his head?

19:12.999 --> 19:13.971
Hair.

19:14.006 --> 19:15.964
It looks like a yellow yarmulke.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.597
No, it's hair.

19:17.632 --> 19:19.982
Any of those bodachs with him?

19:20.017 --> 19:22.334
More than I've ever seen before.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.788
You're not shivering
'cause of cold ice cream, are you?

19:31.716 --> 19:33.902
I'm gonna see what this guy's up to.

19:33.937 --> 19:36.090
- Stormy, wait, wait.
- You, sit.

19:45.675 --> 19:47.961
You think those fish
are up to something?

19:48.383 --> 19:51.717
All fish do are eat, excrete,
and fornicate all in the same water.

19:51.752 --> 19:53.140
Fish are disgusting.

19:53.175 --> 19:55.307
Oh, I never thought so till now.

19:55.342 --> 19:58.175
Your creepy friend is buying
two gallons of the summer special.

19:58.210 --> 19:59.599
Are the flavors significant?

19:59.634 --> 20:02.122
That's your department.
I'm just reporting in.

20:02.426 --> 20:04.572
Cherry chocolate coconut chunk?

20:04.607 --> 20:06.683
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

20:06.718 --> 20:11.176
I didn't realize the grammar was
so rigid in the ice-cream business.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.550
Well, now you know.

20:16.718 --> 20:18.590
This is bad for business.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.999
Why? No one can see em but me.

20:24.926 --> 20:27.172
Well, how could a bunch
of slithering, evil spirits...

20:27.207 --> 20:29.419
and guy who look like
fungus be good for business?

20:30.052 --> 20:32.541
Fungus Man scares me.
Can't you forget him?

20:32.969 --> 20:33.850
I have a gift.

20:33.885 --> 20:36.177
It wouldn't have been given to me
if I wasn't supposed to use it.

20:36.212 --> 20:38.261
- Maybe it's not a gift.
- It's a gift.

20:38.296 --> 20:40.548
I still got the box it came in.

20:41.595 --> 20:42.727
Here. Take my keys.

20:42.762 --> 20:44.880
And please show up
for dinner alive...

20:44.915 --> 20:46.999
because, remember,
I can't see the dead.

21:22.763 --> 21:25.437
If someone is going
to cause extreme violence...

21:25.472 --> 21:29.270
especially on a massive scale,
which this is starting to look like...

21:29.305 --> 21:34.009
bodachs will not leave him untiI the
last ounce of blood has been spilled.

21:35.556 --> 21:38.589
But they lost interest
in Fungus Man.

22:17.350 --> 22:20.350
Winstons, Camels, and Marlboros.

22:20.385 --> 22:23.265
Fungus Man has friends.

23:03.060 --> 23:05.051
Oh, now would be
a good time to run.

24:34.023 --> 24:35.054
Bodachs.

26:14.737 --> 26:17.356
- Hey.
- Loop me in, odd one.

26:17.654 --> 26:21.612
I think I just achieved a personaI
best in the "jump and gasp" event.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.504
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.328
I found a gateway to hell.

26:25.363 --> 26:26.911
I'm walking back to it right now.

26:26.946 --> 26:29.738
Most people would have
the good sense to run away from it.

26:29.773 --> 26:33.186
- Well, I'm not like most people.
- Not in the least.

26:39.947 --> 26:41.523
It's gone now.

26:43.697 --> 26:44.829
Or hidden.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.981
So, is Fungus Bob a man or
something new in the neighborhood?

26:48.281 --> 26:49.939
I don't know.

26:52.365 --> 26:54.288
This place looks like
some kind of shrine.

26:54.323 --> 26:55.246
UNABOMBER...
Theodore Kaczynski Arrested and...

26:55.281 --> 26:56.198
Bundy Claims...
Police Believe The Number To Be...

26:56.233 --> 26:57.621
Cannibal Killer
DECAPITATED UNABOMBER

26:57.656 --> 27:01.115
Shrine of guys that like to
make belts out of women's nipples.

27:01.150 --> 27:02.359
What?

27:04.656 --> 27:06.114
Who is this guy?

27:07.240 --> 27:10.985
His real name is Robert Robertson.

27:11.615 --> 27:13.789
Well, hello Fungus Bob.

27:13.824 --> 27:16.324
Did you check the refrigerator
for any severed heads?

27:16.359 --> 27:18.039
No, I didn't open his refrigerator.

27:18.074 --> 27:20.490
Where else would you expect
to find severed heads?

27:20.525 --> 27:22.362
I wasn't looking for any.

27:24.449 --> 27:26.581
Stormy, Stormy, someone's here.
I got to go.

27:26.616 --> 27:28.664
We don't know
what this guy's planning to do yet.

27:28.699 --> 27:31.188
You know what? Let me ask him
to wait outside untiI I'm finished.

27:32.866 --> 27:35.272
I can feel that.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.491
Wait a minute.
What's today's date?

27:40.526 --> 27:41.790
August 14th.

27:41.825 --> 27:44.117
The page to August 15th
is torn out of his calendar.

27:44.152 --> 27:46.322
That's tomorrow.
What happens tomorrow?

27:47.159 --> 27:50.284
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get out of there, Oddie.

27:50.319 --> 27:53.076
Maybe he has a file on himself,
you know?

27:53.111 --> 27:54.833
Unsolved murders and atrocities.

27:54.868 --> 27:57.154
Chief and I could figure
out a way to entrap him.

27:59.035 --> 28:01.951
So, what's in it?
Is he a mass murderer?

28:01.986 --> 28:03.279
No.

28:05.576 --> 28:07.416
But I think he wants to be.

28:07.451 --> 28:11.113
Hey, Bob!
Robert, where the hell are you?

28:11.410 --> 28:13.815
I want my gun back!

28:19.119 --> 28:21.110
Oh, shit. Damn dogs.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.077
Shut up, you hear me?

28:29.661 --> 28:31.085
Shut up you damn dogs!

28:31.120 --> 28:34.319
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?

28:40.995 --> 28:43.620
Wyatt is out back here burning
some perfectly good steaks.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.745
Thanks, Karla.

28:44.780 --> 28:45.960
Chief.

28:45.995 --> 28:49.037
Odd, I hope you haven't come
here to dampen my evening.

28:49.072 --> 28:50.460
I share your hope, sir.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.058
Been communing with the dead?

28:52.093 --> 28:54.000
It's not about who's dead, sir.

28:54.035 --> 28:55.907
It's about who soon might be.

28:58.496 --> 29:00.336
We call him Fungus Bob.

29:00.371 --> 29:03.496
Yeah, I saw him enter the grill, but
he didn't strike me as suspicious.

29:03.531 --> 29:05.670
Just unfortunate.

29:05.705 --> 29:08.913
Oh, you don't have the advantage
of seeing his fan club, sir.

29:08.948 --> 29:12.336
I guarantee you hell on earth
is coming to Pico Mundo.

29:12.371 --> 29:15.746
You know sometimes you expect me
to walk a dangerously narrow line.

29:15.781 --> 29:19.122
That's just because I've got such
great respect for your balance, sir.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.806
Son that sounds perilously close
to being bullshit.

29:21.841 --> 29:24.455
There's a little bit of
bullshit in it. A little.

29:24.490 --> 29:26.504
But it's mostly sincere.

29:26.539 --> 29:28.935
Odd this is one of
our newer officers...

29:28.970 --> 29:31.331
- Bern Eckles.
- Oh, hi. We met yesterday.

29:31.366 --> 29:32.963
Good collar, that Harlo character.

29:32.998 --> 29:34.873
I can't believe
I once dated that perv.

29:34.908 --> 29:36.172
And of course you know Lysette.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.706
Bern, I want you
to do a little DMV check on..

29:38.741 --> 29:40.993
this guy Odd was telling me about.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.957
I think Officer Eckles
is a little worried

29:44.992 --> 29:46.089
I might try to hook up with you.

29:46.124 --> 29:47.790
Karla and the chief
are trying to set us up...

29:47.825 --> 29:49.662
him being new to the force and all.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.624
It's like cleaning fluid
with sugar in it.

29:53.659 --> 29:55.339
Which reminds me, how's your dad?

29:55.374 --> 29:59.332
He's selling pieces of the moon
online, vacation home sites.

29:59.367 --> 30:00.255
Is that legal?

30:00.290 --> 30:02.791
He certainly doesn't guarantee
the quality of the air.

30:02.826 --> 30:05.083
And how's it going with Bronwen?

30:05.118 --> 30:06.624
She prefers "Stormy. "

30:06.659 --> 30:07.999
Who wouldn't?

30:09.042 --> 30:10.882
Did you used to play piano?

30:10.917 --> 30:13.291
I did, yeah, for years.
How'd you know that?

30:13.326 --> 30:15.583
'Cause you have really
beautifuI hands.

30:15.618 --> 30:17.160
I bet you play like a dream.

30:19.750 --> 30:22.458
You know Odd, you're a strange one.

30:22.493 --> 30:25.168
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

30:25.202 --> 30:26.957
Bit of an oddball.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.876
That was my nickname
all through high school.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.601
But you do have your charms.

30:31.636 --> 30:33.257
That's what Stormy says.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.925
Personally,
I find it rather dubious.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.085
You know, if you ever decide
to give cooking lessons...

30:38.120 --> 30:39.716
you should give me a call.

30:39.751 --> 30:42.341
I bet you really know
how to whisk.

30:42.376 --> 30:44.876
Sure, yeah,
with scrambled eggs and stuff.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.602
But, pancakes, you really,
you got to fold em.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.293
But, mostly,
I just fry, fry, fry, you know?

30:50.328 --> 30:52.165
Hey, Odd. We got to talk.

30:53.627 --> 30:55.968
Robertson moved here
five months ago.

30:56.003 --> 30:58.669
Before that,
he was living with his mother.

30:58.704 --> 31:01.374
Inherited a shitload
when she died last year.

31:01.409 --> 31:04.045
Clean record, though.
Not even a speeding ticket.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.968
How'd his mother die?

31:06.003 --> 31:08.774
Officer Eckles is checking on
that right now.

31:08.809 --> 31:11.545
But otherwise,
I got squat on your Fungus Bob.

31:11.580 --> 31:12.426
I can't hold him.

31:12.461 --> 31:16.211
All right, well, you do agree that
he's strange and suspicious, right?

31:16.246 --> 31:19.128
If strange and suspicious were
enough to put someone in jail...

31:19.163 --> 31:21.001
you'd already be there.

31:22.378 --> 31:23.670
You're gonna watch him right?

31:23.705 --> 31:24.927
Only because you're never wrong,

31:24.962 --> 31:27.170
I'll put on a tail on him
and watch his house.

31:27.205 --> 31:29.879
You go and have
your dinner with Stormy.

31:29.914 --> 31:30.761
She's the one.

31:30.796 --> 31:32.940
You are one smooth operator, Odd.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.085
She must love to hear you say that.

31:35.504 --> 31:37.045
I love to hear me say it.

31:49.047 --> 31:51.338
You better not be hauling
any dead guys on my scooter.

31:51.373 --> 31:53.297
- Dead don't ride scooters.
- Just saying.

31:53.332 --> 31:55.089
I'd have to scrub
the seat for hours.

31:55.123 --> 31:56.804
Destroying the pleather.

31:56.839 --> 31:59.756
I see you left your hormone
spigot running, griddle boy.

31:59.791 --> 32:01.960
Crank it shut.
This is a church.

32:05.172 --> 32:06.631
I know it's a church.

32:06.666 --> 32:08.055
I have a brain, you know.

32:08.089 --> 32:09.673
You know why I call you Pooh Bear?

32:09.708 --> 32:10.972
Because I'm so cuddly.

32:11.007 --> 32:13.411
Because his head is full of stuffin'

32:18.423 --> 32:19.722
Now listen to me, odd one.

32:19.757 --> 32:21.757
I don't want you going back
to that creepy room again.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.680
It doesn't exist anymore.

32:23.715 --> 32:25.507
Well, don't go looking for
it hoping it'll come back.

32:25.542 --> 32:27.555
- Never crossed my mind.
- Yes, it did.

32:27.590 --> 32:30.194
- Yes, it did.
- It is a gate to the underworld...

32:30.229 --> 32:32.764
and you are forbidden by me
to ever play in it again.

32:32.799 --> 32:35.382
It's hard enough living with a guy who
helps dead people without having to

32:35.417 --> 32:38.090
trek all the way down to hell
to pull his ass out of the fire.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.091
Since when are we living together?

32:40.126 --> 32:40.973
We will be.

32:41.008 --> 32:43.508
Oh, I guess I didn't think
"Let's put a pin in it" meant "Yes. "

32:43.543 --> 32:46.009
You have to learn to listen
with more than just your ears.

32:46.043 --> 32:48.710
Stormy, what body part am
I supposed to listen with?

32:49.758 --> 32:52.383
Right. My heart.
I'm supposed to listen with my heart.

32:52.418 --> 32:53.599
Listen with my heart.

32:53.634 --> 32:58.842
I will do something big
to improve our financial situation.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.766
- Your idea about selling car tires?
- Bigger.

33:00.801 --> 33:03.092
And what, from your perspective,
is bigger than tires?

33:03.127 --> 33:04.109
- Shoes.
- Shoes?

33:04.144 --> 33:05.057
Yeah, think about it.

33:05.092 --> 33:07.738
A family of 5 might have 2 cars
but they have 10 feet.

33:07.773 --> 33:10.349
Not only that, but they need
different kinds of shoes.

33:10.384 --> 33:12.676
Dress shoes, winkle pickers,
high-tops, low-tops, running shoes-

33:12.711 --> 33:14.760
But not you. You have
5 pairs of the same sneakers.

33:14.795 --> 33:16.964
- Like I said
- You're not like most people.

33:17.885 --> 33:20.089
Not in the least.

33:28.302 --> 33:29.969
Do you want crackers
with your cheese?

33:30.003 --> 33:31.184
We have a problem.

33:31.219 --> 33:32.886
Crackers aren't a problem,
just a choice.

33:32.921 --> 33:33.684
- Come on.
- What?

33:33.719 --> 33:35.591
- Come on! It's Fungus Bob!
- What!

33:36.844 --> 33:38.716
He followed me. I don't know how.

33:39.886 --> 33:43.184
Shit! Come on! Come on!

33:43.219 --> 33:44.852
- It's him? You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure!

33:44.887 --> 33:47.386
You don't think the two of us
could kick his ass?

33:47.421 --> 33:48.927
Not this guy.

34:10.804 --> 34:12.261
- Come on!
- The sacristy!

34:17.804 --> 34:19.879
The back door.
Come on. Come on.

34:20.179 --> 34:21.937
Wait! Wait. Come here.

34:21.971 --> 34:24.674
We're heading towards danger,
not away from it. I can feeI it.

34:26.138 --> 34:28.922
It's like he's everywhere.
He's in front of us. He's behind us.

34:29.971 --> 34:31.429
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.

34:31.465 --> 34:33.382
- Let's call the cops.
- No time.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.302
I have a better plan.
You stay here.

34:35.723 --> 34:37.284
I'm gonna run over there
and open the door.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.848
If he doesn't lunge through,
you run that way.

34:38.882 --> 34:40.978
If, however, he does lunge through,

34:41.014 --> 34:43.097
you run this way and
I'll try to follow you.

34:43.132 --> 34:44.632
Some plan, odd one.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.132
It's the best I've got.

34:46.556 --> 34:48.097
Full of stuffin'.

35:02.265 --> 35:04.973
Does that mean "Get on with it"
or "Up yours"?

35:05.008 --> 35:06.431
Unbelievable.

35:06.973 --> 35:08.004
Right.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.552
Come on! Come on!

36:01.352 --> 36:02.567
Chief, it's Stormy.

36:02.602 --> 36:05.310
I'm sorry to drop in on date night,
but here's Odd.

36:05.345 --> 36:07.983
Sir, if you send a car real
quick to St. Bart's...

36:08.018 --> 36:10.728
you may be able to catch
Robertson trashing the sacristy...

36:10.763 --> 36:11.942
or even the whole church.

36:11.977 --> 36:14.026
What was he doing
vandalizing St. Bart's?

36:14.061 --> 36:16.561
He was trying to catch me
and Stormy in the belfry.

36:16.596 --> 36:18.520
What were you and Stormy
doing in the belfry?

36:18.555 --> 36:20.682
Well, we were having a picnic, sir.

36:20.717 --> 36:22.810
I'm sure that makes sense to you.

36:25.395 --> 36:28.889
My guy at Robertsons house said
he still hasn't been home yet.

36:28.924 --> 36:32.385
Yeah, because apparently
Bob's been too busy following me.

36:33.228 --> 36:34.319
Oh, one second.

36:34.354 --> 36:36.646
- Where are you going?
- To get some food.

36:36.681 --> 36:38.937
How can you think
of dinner right now?

36:38.972 --> 36:40.778
Because I'm hungry.

36:40.812 --> 36:43.727
Look, Odd.
Vandalism, big deaI.

36:44.146 --> 36:47.643
I thought you said this guy
was gonna bring on the apocalypse.

36:47.678 --> 36:51.139
Yes, sir, on August 15th,
which is less than 3 hours away.

36:51.229 --> 36:54.346
Trust me, that is the day that
Pico Mundo will never forget.

36:57.063 --> 36:58.487
Lyle!

36:58.522 --> 37:00.668
Oh. Hi, Odd. Hi Stormy.

37:00.703 --> 37:02.813
- Hi, Ozzie.
- Hey, Oz.

37:02.848 --> 37:04.271
Odd.

37:05.813 --> 37:06.772
- I'll be right back.
- Lyle, you know that

37:07.611 --> 37:08.641
I know guys who know guys, right?
Right. - Right.

37:08.676 --> 37:11.564
So if you guys don't stop
messing up my takeout orders..

37:11.599 --> 37:13.314
you're the one that's gonna
get taken out. Get it?

37:13.349 --> 37:14.321
- Got it.
- Good.

37:14.356 --> 37:16.439
Oz, Oz, watch your blood pressure.

37:16.474 --> 37:18.071
My blood- Hey, Odd...

37:18.106 --> 37:19.897
my blood has got
cholesterol molecules

37:19.932 --> 37:21.196
the size of marshmallows in it...

37:21.231 --> 37:23.648
and if it wasn't for a little
righteous outrage every now and again

37:23.683 --> 37:25.722
my arteries would
completely collapse.

37:28.106 --> 37:31.649
I finished that
trinket you asked for.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.639
Perfect.

37:37.065 --> 37:39.322
Wow, Oz, what exactly is this?

37:39.357 --> 37:43.024
It's a steel heart 6 inches
in diameter, like you said.

37:43.059 --> 37:44.448
No, I said...

37:44.483 --> 37:48.107
"A piece of steel 6 inches
in diameter to go over a heart. "

37:48.142 --> 37:50.608
Well, man,
I embellished, you know?

37:50.643 --> 37:52.156
I get in the moment.

37:52.191 --> 37:54.774
I mean, why would Stormy
wanna wear that?

37:54.809 --> 37:56.615
It's not for Stormy.

37:56.650 --> 37:59.896
I keep having this image of a...

38:02.400 --> 38:04.474
a bullet going through a heart.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.557
It's perfect. Thank you.

38:13.526 --> 38:14.556
Hey, Chief.

38:17.192 --> 38:20.109
- This place is trashed.
- Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.

38:20.144 --> 38:21.949
I'm sure you're right.
You always are.

38:21.984 --> 38:25.193
But he was long gone.
Didn't leave a single print.

38:25.228 --> 38:27.485
Even the chalices were spotless.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.408
Weird, huh?

38:28.443 --> 38:32.068
I'll give my psychic magnetism a try
to see if I can find him again.

38:32.103 --> 38:33.408
Take Stormy home first.

38:33.443 --> 38:35.318
- Like hell he will!
- I heard that.

38:35.353 --> 38:36.432
He heard that.

38:36.860 --> 38:39.325
Chief, you know
I love Oddie desperately...

38:39.360 --> 38:43.527
so madly I would cut off my hand if
that made any sense as proof of love.

38:43.562 --> 38:45.528
And now I find out
there's a guy trying to kill him.

38:45.563 --> 38:47.813
No one was trying
to kill me, Stormy.

38:48.236 --> 38:50.076
What, you think
he was hitting on you?

38:50.111 --> 38:53.445
You know, this is the craziest
conversation I've ever had.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.944
Odd you're a fountain
of crazy conversations.

38:55.979 --> 38:57.272
A geyser.

38:59.278 --> 39:02.399
Time feels like
a powerfuI black wave...

39:02.434 --> 39:05.520
that wishes to crash down
and engulf us.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.933
I must run faster.

39:17.404 --> 39:19.453
BOWLING

39:19.488 --> 39:21.883
Why did I drive here?

39:21.918 --> 39:24.244
Green Moon BOWLING

39:24.279 --> 39:26.744
Oh, my God.
Oddie, your nightmare...

39:26.779 --> 39:29.572
the slaughter of the bowling alley
people, is it happening here tonight?

39:29.607 --> 39:31.147
- Now?
- No.

39:31.447 --> 39:32.579
No, no, I checked this place.

39:32.614 --> 39:34.779
The employees here wear green
and gold shirts.

39:34.814 --> 39:36.412
- So?
- So, in my dreams,

39:36.447 --> 39:40.108
the victims wear red-and-black shirts
with little black nbowling balls on em.

39:41.239 --> 39:43.620
And I don't see
Fungus Bob's car anywhere.

39:43.655 --> 39:45.406
You think the slaughter of
the bowling alley people

39:45.441 --> 39:46.780
and Fungus Bob are connected?

39:46.815 --> 39:48.108
Yeah.

39:49.364 --> 39:51.236
Yeah, yeah, I know they are.

39:57.281 --> 39:58.939
GREEN MOON BOWLING

40:14.157 --> 40:15.946
They got new uniforms.

40:27.616 --> 40:29.157
Don't you dare.

40:29.574 --> 40:31.447
Oh, Wyatt.

40:32.408 --> 40:36.242
You said that whatever was gonna
happen wouldn't happen untiI tomorrow.

40:36.277 --> 40:38.551
- Yes, sir, but you see-
- I still got an hour.

40:38.585 --> 40:40.825
I know, sir.
I just want to keep you up to date.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.457
I think there's a good chance that

40:42.492 --> 40:44.632
Bob Robertson might
come to Green Moon Alley...

40:44.667 --> 40:46.774
to do a little more
than just hook some balls.

40:56.243 --> 40:59.285
Maybe you wanna send a guy out here
to, you know, keep an eye out?

40:59.320 --> 41:01.417
Any of those bodarch things around?

41:01.452 --> 41:05.610
Bodachs. No, sir,
but they will show up when he does.

41:05.743 --> 41:08.446
Yeah-yeah. All right.
I'll send a guy right over.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.991
Something doesn't feel right.

41:12.410 --> 41:13.833
Something's wrong.

41:13.868 --> 41:15.431
Are you nuts?
Everything's wrong.

41:15.466 --> 41:16.959
There's going to be a massacre...

41:16.994 --> 41:18.973
and I'll bet you
it's going to happen here.

41:19.008 --> 41:20.917
No, all we know is it's
the same uniforms,

41:20.952 --> 41:23.451
so it's the same
group of people getting killed.

41:23.486 --> 41:25.950
But tomorrow,
any of them could be anywhere.

41:28.661 --> 41:31.991
God, I'm missing something.
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.778
I need to see Viola.

41:39.786 --> 41:40.948
Evening!

41:41.870 --> 41:44.162
- Odd Thomas, right?
- Yeah.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.430
Miss Lewellyn.

41:45.465 --> 41:46.627
The chief sent me.

41:46.662 --> 41:49.281
So you know this guy, right?

41:50.329 --> 41:53.327
I've seen him a couple times today
but no, I don't know him.

41:53.537 --> 41:56.371
Yeah, chief says,
If you see him reach for his pocket

41:56.406 --> 41:58.243
he's probably not going
for a breath mint.

41:59.704 --> 42:01.627
- Wise words from a wise man.
- Yeah.

42:01.662 --> 42:04.779
So what exactly makes this guy
so suspicious and dangerous?

42:05.205 --> 42:07.823
He came into the grill
for lunch today.

42:08.871 --> 42:11.158
That's it? You served him lunch?

42:11.193 --> 42:13.446
- He was weird.
- How weird?

42:13.538 --> 42:14.545
He had weird friends.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.039
- He has friends?
- Weird ones.

42:16.074 --> 42:17.413
How weird?

42:18.039 --> 42:19.283
Very weird.

42:22.289 --> 42:26.664
And a couple hours ago,
he got very aggressive with me.

42:26.699 --> 42:28.629
Wait. A couple hours ago,

42:28.664 --> 42:32.077
this guy, Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

42:32.831 --> 42:35.415
Look, the creep made a pass at me
and Odd told him to back off...

42:35.449 --> 42:38.247
and the creep got,
you know, creepy.

42:39.081 --> 42:40.326
Creepy.

42:42.831 --> 42:45.623
Hey, Simon, I've been dying
to know what this tattoo means.

42:45.658 --> 42:47.282
- Do you mind?
- POD

42:49.082 --> 42:51.037
Well, Stormy...

42:51.249 --> 42:53.505
when I was a teenager,
I was a mess.

42:53.540 --> 42:56.519
If it wasn't for the police
academy and the good Lord

42:56.554 --> 42:59.499
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity...

42:59.534 --> 43:01.454
that I'd rather not
say the meaning of.

43:01.791 --> 43:04.575
Well, what a gentleman you are.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.540
Nighty-night, Simon.

43:09.292 --> 43:10.535
Night.

43:14.167 --> 43:15.715
You manipulate me like that?

43:15.750 --> 43:18.334
Good heavens odd one,
I manipulate you every day.

43:18.369 --> 43:19.673
- You do?
- Yes.

43:19.708 --> 43:22.625
Gently, of course, and with great
affection and you always like it.

43:22.660 --> 43:23.869
Oh, I do?

43:24.292 --> 43:26.549
You are so adorable.

43:26.584 --> 43:28.716
- I'm not adorable.
- Oh, please.

43:28.751 --> 43:31.459
Puppies, puppies,
little puppies, are adorable.

43:31.494 --> 43:35.618
You and puppies,
totally adorable.

43:38.542 --> 43:40.533
I had a feeling
I'd see you tonight.

43:41.168 --> 43:43.459
- It's about my dream, isn't it?
- You said you were shot.

43:43.494 --> 43:47.259
My skull was all whacked,
my eyeball swollen.

43:47.294 --> 43:49.856
You know dreams have nothing
to do with the reaI future, Vi.

43:49.891 --> 43:52.418
We've already been over that
territory, but here you are.

43:52.453 --> 43:54.077
Where are you in your dream?

43:54.502 --> 43:56.998
No place.
A dream place. Fuzzy.

43:57.033 --> 43:59.493
Are you planning on going bowling?

43:59.919 --> 44:01.940
Bowling? Did you hit your head?

44:01.975 --> 44:03.926
What are your plans tomorrow?

44:03.961 --> 44:07.250
Levanna's birthday is Sunday,
but tips are real good on a Sunday

44:07.285 --> 44:10.539
so I was gonna work it and celebrate
her birthday tomorrow instead.

44:11.170 --> 44:14.087
A lot of people died in that
dream of yours, huh Odd?

44:14.122 --> 44:15.331
Yeah, they did.

44:16.170 --> 44:17.828
Your dreams ever come true?

44:18.129 --> 44:19.704
Sometimes.

44:20.962 --> 44:22.206
I thought so.

44:24.171 --> 44:25.829
Close your eyes, Vi.

44:36.587 --> 44:40.203
In your dream what do you see?

44:40.838 --> 44:43.456
- What do you hear?
- All right.

44:44.379 --> 44:46.666
I'm running.

44:47.297 --> 44:51.456
There's suddenly lots of
flashing lights with...

44:52.214 --> 44:54.086
old-fashioned kiddie music.

44:56.672 --> 45:00.120
And then I hear a big crowd,
a roaring one.

45:01.173 --> 45:03.096
Like in a big football stadium.

45:03.131 --> 45:06.165
And then there's the sound
of water, gushing water.

45:07.631 --> 45:08.875
How do you die?

45:09.714 --> 45:13.127
It's like someone hit me with
a baseball bat, quick, like twice.

45:13.673 --> 45:16.381
I scream and
fall to my hands and knees.

45:16.416 --> 45:18.104
My hands slip, slippery.

45:18.139 --> 45:19.792
What are you slipping on?

45:20.215 --> 45:23.090
Oh, God. Blood.
There's blood everywhere.

45:23.125 --> 45:25.965
What's under the blood,
under your hands?

45:26.000 --> 45:27.899
A floor, grass, concrete?

45:27.934 --> 45:29.798
I'm staring at the dead man.

45:32.216 --> 45:35.131
Do you know him?
Do you recognize him?

45:39.716 --> 45:42.631
Oh, dear Lord, Odd.
So many dead bodies.

45:44.175 --> 45:46.663
Odd, you have to stop
this from happening.

45:51.175 --> 45:53.196
Oh, Odd, is there any hope
this could pass?

45:53.231 --> 45:55.217
If you listen to Oddie,
you'll be just fine.

45:55.251 --> 45:56.247
No.

45:57.508 --> 46:00.900
Fate is not a straight road.
There are many forks in it.

46:00.935 --> 46:04.292
You have the free will to choose
which one you take, but...

46:04.717 --> 46:06.141
sometimes it will bend around...

46:06.176 --> 46:09.588
and bring you straight back
to that same stubborn fate.

46:11.384 --> 46:13.126
I just wanna check on the girls.

46:18.468 --> 46:20.340
They're so beautiful, Viola.

46:21.052 --> 46:22.927
And they're such good girls.

46:22.962 --> 46:24.776
They're lucky to have you.

46:24.811 --> 46:26.591
That's what everyone says.

46:55.012 --> 46:56.174
Odd?

46:57.428 --> 46:59.715
- Anything wrong?
- No.

47:00.137 --> 47:04.096
No, no, no. I just wanted
to make sure the girls were safe.

47:04.131 --> 47:06.227
And with the bars on the windows

47:06.262 --> 47:09.095
I taught them how to work
the emergency release myself.

47:23.346 --> 47:27.720
Well, looks like everything's
a- okay in here.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.534
Step one, do not stay here.

47:31.569 --> 47:33.437
I'll go to my grandma's.

47:33.472 --> 47:34.618
Don't tell your grandma
you're coming.

47:34.653 --> 47:35.764
Don't tell the girls
where you're going.

47:35.799 --> 47:37.594
I don't want you overheard.

47:37.629 --> 47:39.354
- By who?
- By anyone.

47:39.389 --> 47:42.008
Or anything. Just go with it.

47:44.389 --> 47:47.921
Step two is don't go bowling if
for some reason you get the itch.

47:52.306 --> 47:54.181
I can't believe we're leaving
those horrid things...

47:54.216 --> 47:55.974
hovering around those sweet girls.

47:56.009 --> 47:56.855
They won't hurt em.

47:56.890 --> 47:58.974
They just want to smell em
before they die.

47:59.009 --> 48:00.106
God.

48:00.140 --> 48:03.348
Look, Stormy, there's nothing
I can do about bodachs, okay?

48:03.383 --> 48:05.188
And right now
I wouldn't even if I could.

48:05.223 --> 48:08.474
I need em to help me see the danger
coming so I can maybe prevent it.

48:08.509 --> 48:11.388
And when they eventually find out
that you can see them?

48:16.474 --> 48:17.898
Oddie, will you ever leave here?

48:17.933 --> 48:21.266
Well, I sure hope I don't end up like
Tom Jedd hanging out at Tire World.

48:21.301 --> 48:23.257
I meant while you're alive.

48:26.059 --> 48:28.515
Hey. Hey, Stormy.

48:28.550 --> 48:30.972
Hey, hey. Look, look.

48:33.059 --> 48:35.434
Look, Stormy,
if you want us to go, I'll go.

48:35.469 --> 48:36.891
It's not that. It's-

48:38.267 --> 48:40.423
I am just so scared for you, Oddie.

48:40.767 --> 48:44.180
So scared, ever since
I saw that creep Fungus Bob.

48:45.643 --> 48:47.099
I'm sorry. I just-

48:48.476 --> 48:50.217
I love you so much.

48:55.226 --> 48:56.650
My Pooh Bear.

48:56.685 --> 48:59.935
I promise you on
the other side of tomorrow...

48:59.970 --> 49:03.550
I will have all my stuffing intact.

49:08.477 --> 49:10.135
That must be for you.

49:57.229 --> 49:58.557
Oh, God!

49:59.605 --> 50:03.000
I heard the scream.
She ran across my yard.

50:03.035 --> 50:06.396
I saw the dogs following her.
I grabbed my gun.

50:07.647 --> 50:08.981
I shot the dogs.

50:09.015 --> 50:10.354
It's on.

50:12.856 --> 50:15.558
All right. Here's what we know.

50:16.189 --> 50:21.272
Lysette left my barbecue with
Officer Eckles at around 7:45.

50:21.307 --> 50:23.947
He dropped her off at home
clocked in at 8:00,

50:23.981 --> 50:26.690
and was manning the front
desk when he got the call.

50:26.725 --> 50:30.113
So somewhere
between 8:00 and midnight,

50:30.148 --> 50:32.753
Lysette was whacked in the eye
and then tied up

50:32.788 --> 50:35.357
and gagged and hauled
all the way the hell out here

50:35.392 --> 50:37.822
and had two Rottweilers
sicked on her.

50:37.857 --> 50:40.565
Hey, Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

50:40.600 --> 50:42.197
His name's Kevin Goss.

50:42.232 --> 50:44.280
He was teaching a class
from 6:00 to 10:00...

50:44.315 --> 50:47.107
then he went to Starbucks
till they closed at midnight.

50:47.142 --> 50:49.513
He got home about
two minutes too late.

50:49.816 --> 50:53.691
Sir? I've actually seen
those Rottweilers before.

50:53.726 --> 50:55.563
They belong to Bob Robertson.

50:58.692 --> 51:00.148
All right!

51:00.567 --> 51:03.900
I want an A. P. B.
put out on this guy now!

51:03.935 --> 51:05.198
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

51:05.233 --> 51:08.275
Simon, I want you to go back
over to Robertson's house.

51:08.310 --> 51:09.941
I'll have a search
warrant in the morning

51:09.976 --> 51:11.157
as soon as the courthouse opens.

51:11.192 --> 51:14.942
Sir, no offense, but I wasted most
of the day staking out that house.

51:14.977 --> 51:18.693
Then I went to the bowling alley
and stayed there untiI they closed.

51:18.728 --> 51:20.019
Nothing happened.

51:20.651 --> 51:23.270
Nobody showed.
It was a complete waste of my time.

51:23.901 --> 51:28.891
Sir, are we sure this Robertson
character isn't just a wild goose chase?

51:29.401 --> 51:31.401
Exactly where were you between
the hours of 8:00 and 10:00?

51:31.436 --> 51:35.146
- He was with me the whole time.
- Just ease up.

51:35.443 --> 51:38.485
Now go check the house again
and ask around about the dogs.

51:38.520 --> 51:39.813
Yes, sir.

51:42.027 --> 51:43.140
You two.

51:43.694 --> 51:44.808
Home.

51:45.444 --> 51:46.606
Go, now!

51:51.486 --> 51:55.646
I think you should wear this.
Try not to laugh.

52:03.903 --> 52:06.612
Oddie, you are not responsible
for every death you can't prevent.

52:06.647 --> 52:07.493
She died.

52:07.528 --> 52:10.570
And if Fungus Bob was her killer,
I was either slow or stupid.

52:10.605 --> 52:11.661
Choose your weapon.

52:11.696 --> 52:13.452
Why would Fungus Bob kill Lysette?

52:13.487 --> 52:15.202
What's the connection?
It makes no sense.

52:15.237 --> 52:19.529
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just has to satisfy some sick urge.

52:19.564 --> 52:21.401
Maybe he's warming up.

52:22.112 --> 52:24.946
I think the chief just sent
some detectives to protect you.

52:24.981 --> 52:26.688
I don't need protecting.

52:27.862 --> 52:30.979
Actually I think it might
just be surveillance.

52:31.904 --> 52:33.245
Fungus Bob followed me
to the church.

52:33.280 --> 52:35.863
I bet the chief is hoping
he'll sniff me out again.

52:35.898 --> 52:37.495
If the chief is using you as bait...

52:37.530 --> 52:40.647
he should at least ask if
you mind having a hook in your ass.

52:45.988 --> 52:49.818
Oh, man, I got to stay focused.

52:51.905 --> 52:54.821
Good. You keep an eye on my girl.

52:55.989 --> 52:57.861
August 15th had begun.

52:58.281 --> 53:00.022
Time was running out.

53:47.033 --> 53:48.491
Hey, Bob.

53:49.617 --> 53:51.489
You're not planning
on getting up, are ya?

53:55.368 --> 53:57.026
But if you're dead...

53:57.451 --> 53:59.939
who's gonna massacre Pico Mundo?

54:00.660 --> 54:03.693
Gun on the floor,
dead guy in my tub.

54:04.201 --> 54:06.488
I know a setup when I see one.

54:07.535 --> 54:10.867
But if I call the police,
the chief will have to arrest me...

54:10.902 --> 54:14.200
and I won't be able to stop
the catastrophe from happening.

54:24.411 --> 54:26.042
Oh, my God!

54:26.077 --> 54:28.282
Oh, you are creeping me out.

54:42.744 --> 54:44.617
You're freezing cold, Bob.

54:45.454 --> 54:48.368
Your rigor mortis is way advanced.

54:49.621 --> 54:51.611
You know...

54:51.828 --> 54:54.329
the chief said
you didn't leave any fingerprints.

54:54.364 --> 54:56.201
He didn't leave a single print.

54:58.079 --> 55:01.279
And Stormy never actually saw you.

55:02.121 --> 55:03.495
- Come on!
- What?

55:07.455 --> 55:09.476
Because you were already dead.

55:09.511 --> 55:11.462
And the whole time in the church,

55:11.497 --> 55:14.163
you were actually
a pissed-off poltergeist.

55:14.198 --> 55:16.795
I think the last time
I saw Fungus Bob alive...

55:16.830 --> 55:19.947
was when he left his house
right before I broke into it.

55:21.205 --> 55:25.205
He's been haunting me ever since,
blaming me for his death.

55:25.240 --> 55:29.206
Why he blames me or who the hell
killed him is a little hazy.

55:29.241 --> 55:31.928
If I'm caught,
I'll either be arrested for murder

55:31.963 --> 55:34.616
or rolling what looks like
the biggest joint ever.

55:51.707 --> 55:53.697
It's just me, Rosalia!

56:06.916 --> 56:08.907
Damn it.

56:10.375 --> 56:12.744
Oh, give me a break.

56:14.417 --> 56:16.905
It's just me, again, Rosalia.

56:18.375 --> 56:21.083
I'm gonna borrow
your car again, okay?

56:21.118 --> 56:22.424
If I'm being framed,

56:22.459 --> 56:25.309
why the police have failed
to arrive and arrest me...

56:25.344 --> 56:28.159
or the murderer hasn't come
to kill me, I do not know.

56:40.460 --> 56:43.958
All right, Bob, where can I put you
to quietly decompose for a while...

56:43.993 --> 56:47.457
before someone finds you and has
a new love of Jesus scared into em?

57:06.211 --> 57:07.842
Interesting story, Bob.

57:07.877 --> 57:10.794
After the federal government
abandoned this prison...

57:10.829 --> 57:13.135
it went through a long
series of owners.

57:13.170 --> 57:17.753
Rumor has it that at Von Zipper's
Burgers the fries were delicious...

57:17.788 --> 57:21.201
and the free-soft-drink-refill
policy was generously honored.

57:24.212 --> 57:26.677
And yet, this fine
dining establishment...

57:26.712 --> 57:31.504
never succeeded in winning
over the family-dining crowd...

57:31.539 --> 57:35.035
which is so essential
to any restaurant operation.

57:36.004 --> 57:38.136
Welcome to the gas chamber.

57:38.171 --> 57:39.837
A lot of people died in here, Bob.

57:39.872 --> 57:41.504
You should feeI right at home.

57:56.713 --> 58:00.464
Stormy's always joking about running
off to Las Vegas and getting married.

58:00.499 --> 58:03.506
But I tell her Vegas is packed
with dead people and bad guys...

58:03.540 --> 58:06.504
and I'd just end up
fighting eviI 24-7.

58:08.714 --> 58:10.788
I should have listened to her.

58:13.507 --> 58:14.619
Too many.

58:16.090 --> 58:17.748
Too many.

58:38.799 --> 58:40.556
The chief.

58:40.591 --> 58:41.918
I need the chief.

58:44.008 --> 58:45.764
Dear Lord.

58:45.799 --> 58:49.331
If that's you again, Odd,
we are going to have words!

59:01.009 --> 59:03.083
Oh, my God.

59:10.801 --> 59:12.984
No offense, Odd Thomas,
but I can't think of anybody...

59:13.019 --> 59:15.167
who could come in here right now
and not get my back up.

59:15.467 --> 59:17.822
- So you think he knew the shooter?
- Had to.

59:17.857 --> 59:20.177
Which means it's probably
somebody I know, too.

59:20.212 --> 59:22.665
- How bad is he?
- Bad.

59:24.219 --> 59:26.504
- Well, he's a fighter.
- He better be.

59:27.969 --> 59:29.946
- Hey, Bern.
- Ma'am.

59:29.981 --> 59:31.924
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

59:34.136 --> 59:36.706
- Hey.
- Oh Oddie.

59:36.927 --> 59:39.969
Keep those reporters out of here.
You, on that door.

59:40.004 --> 59:42.256
- Sorry, no press inside.
- Comin through.

59:45.387 --> 59:47.342
You saved his life, Oddie.

59:48.387 --> 59:50.176
Where's this bullet?

59:50.678 --> 59:53.381
That's the one they're
trying to dig out of him now.

59:57.137 --> 59:59.128
Time is up.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:04.133
Pico Mundo is awakening
to a horror that only I can stop.

01:00:05.054 --> 01:00:07.304
Lysette and Fungus Bob are dead.

01:00:07.339 --> 01:00:09.519
The chief is
in the emergency room.

01:00:09.554 --> 01:00:12.470
There's hoards of bodachs
swarming all over town.

01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:14.186
Whatever's coming is gonna be big.

01:00:14.221 --> 01:00:16.894
I'm scared,
and I'm supposed to be fearless.

01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:19.117
- Don't tell me to stay home today.
- Please stay home today.

01:00:19.152 --> 01:00:21.305
- I will if you stay home with me.
- We've been through this.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.805
I have to do
whatever I can to stop it.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.770
Is Viola going to be shot dead?

01:00:25.805 --> 01:00:28.092
You know I don't know
that for sure.

01:00:28.513 --> 01:00:31.085
She's had it hard in life.
She doesn't need this.

01:00:31.722 --> 01:00:34.104
Shot dead? Really?
Who does need it?

01:00:34.139 --> 01:00:36.722
Oh, I don't know
why I try to reason with you.

01:00:36.757 --> 01:00:37.854
I always lose.

01:00:37.889 --> 01:00:39.910
You're a fabulous man of action,
odd one.

01:00:39.945 --> 01:00:41.931
You don't need to be
a good debater, too.

01:00:41.966 --> 01:00:43.687
Besides, you said yourself...

01:00:43.722 --> 01:00:46.431
any road I choose could lead me
right back to the same fate.

01:00:46.466 --> 01:00:48.598
So, which is it?
Do I have free will?

01:00:48.633 --> 01:00:50.257
Am I in God's hands?

01:00:51.098 --> 01:00:52.105
Or is it both?

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.431
Have I ever told you
you've got a lot of issues?

01:00:54.466 --> 01:00:56.189
I'm a woman. We all have issues.

01:00:56.224 --> 01:00:59.286
It's what keeps us interesting,
and you men interested.

01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:02.348
Oh, yeah? It's what makes us
crazy and die younger.

01:01:02.383 --> 01:01:03.592
Do you love me?

01:01:04.348 --> 01:01:06.515
I love you more than life itself.

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.347
See? It's working.

01:01:15.058 --> 01:01:17.891
Don't look back. Don't look back.

01:01:17.926 --> 01:01:19.135
Give him strength.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.557
Knock, knock.

01:01:29.558 --> 01:01:32.342
I'm hoping Bob left
a clue on his computer.

01:01:33.184 --> 01:01:35.589
Something to lead me
to his partner...

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:40.059
to the person who was
planning on killing 100s,

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:43.093
if not 1000s of people.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.527
Hey.

01:02:44.562 --> 01:02:46.312
Loop me in, odd one.
Where are you?

01:02:46.347 --> 01:02:48.201
I'm walking towards the fridge.

01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:50.054
Yours, mine, or Fungus Bob's?

01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:53.153
Don't "uh-huh" me. I told you...

01:02:53.188 --> 01:02:55.896
you are not allowed to go playing
around in any more hell gates.

01:02:55.931 --> 01:02:57.472
Next!

01:02:57.771 --> 01:03:00.121
Oh, God. Cockroaches.

01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:02.470
Always cockroaches.

01:03:02.688 --> 01:03:05.064
- Odd Thomas, did you hear me?
- Which part?

01:03:05.099 --> 01:03:06.278
I can't believe
you went back there.

01:03:06.313 --> 01:03:09.644
Every time you don't listen to me,
you get yourself into trouble.

01:03:10.189 --> 01:03:13.519
- I wish I'd listened to you.
- You get out of there right now.

01:03:13.814 --> 01:03:16.729
Right, right. Leaving. Leaving.

01:03:19.773 --> 01:03:22.481
Never heard you make that
sound before. Is everything okay?

01:03:22.516 --> 01:03:26.309
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?

01:03:27.898 --> 01:03:28.905
Fingers.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.523
Please say they're attached
to someone's hand.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:32.738
Sorry.

01:03:32.773 --> 01:03:33.989
Get out of there, Oddie.

01:03:34.024 --> 01:03:37.238
Someone has been buying
a lot of Burke and Bailey's.

01:03:37.273 --> 01:03:39.440
Yeah? Well, you tell whoever's
buying it that our ice cream...

01:03:39.475 --> 01:03:42.059
may be the best,
but it'll still melt in hell.

01:03:43.941 --> 01:03:45.691
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

01:03:45.726 --> 01:03:46.935
No. Wait.

01:03:47.149 --> 01:03:49.566
I'll leave here first.
Then I'll call 'em.

01:03:49.601 --> 01:03:50.976
Be careful.

01:03:51.011 --> 01:03:52.351
Don't worry.

01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:01.226
Hey, Bob.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.657
I guess when I began to out you,
word somehow spread...

01:04:05.692 --> 01:04:11.108
and you became a liability to
your partner and he had to kill you.

01:04:11.525 --> 01:04:12.769
Sorry about that.

01:04:17.567 --> 01:04:22.275
I find it funny how I know more
about dead people than dead people.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:23.366
This is our realm, Bob.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.434
You can't physically harm
a living person.

01:04:30.902 --> 01:04:32.560
But there is that.

01:04:42.902 --> 01:04:45.473
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

01:04:54.152 --> 01:04:56.107
Gas.

01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:28.566
I'm exhausted, I'm lost,
and somewhere along the way...

01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:32.561
I missed an important clue
that could take me home.

01:05:37.488 --> 01:05:39.360
The bullet through the heart.

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:51.859
It wasn't about the chief.

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:16.235
God.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:44.030
Enough already, Bob. Please.

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:50.278
My three least favorite words.

01:06:50.617 --> 01:06:52.359
Some..

01:06:54.784 --> 01:06:56.442
assembly...

01:06:56.659 --> 01:06:58.708
required.

01:06:58.743 --> 01:07:01.660
Simon, I've been dying to know
what that tattoo means.

01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:04.860
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity.

01:07:06.952 --> 01:07:08.325
It's Varner.

01:07:09.034 --> 01:07:11.950
I once had a run-in with
some devil worshipers.

01:07:12.285 --> 01:07:13.743
I should've known.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.125
P- O-D. Prince Of Darkness.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.042
No wonder Varner was suspicious
when I told him...

01:07:22.077 --> 01:07:24.661
Fungus Bob had gotten aggressive
with me an hour earlier.

01:07:24.696 --> 01:07:27.908
This guy Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

01:07:28.119 --> 01:07:31.449
He had already killed Bob
5 or 6 hours before that.

01:07:31.745 --> 01:07:34.001
And that police van
protecting Stormy?

01:07:34.036 --> 01:07:36.328
That must've been Varner
waiting to follow me home...

01:07:36.363 --> 01:07:38.739
to bust me
for Fungus Bob's murder.

01:07:38.774 --> 01:07:41.114
Or shoot me while resisting arrest.

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.877
There were no bodachs around Varner.

01:07:47.912 --> 01:07:50.669
But I can still feel myself
being drawn to him...

01:07:50.704 --> 01:07:54.235
and to the place where
he's about to commit mass murder.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.244
GREEN MOON MALL

01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:04.575
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:07.153
Oh, God, no.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.156
POLICE

01:08:20.205 --> 01:08:22.080
Hey, Nell,
I see what the problem is.

01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:22.962
Stormy.

01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:25.912
You are eating and
reading at the same time.

01:08:25.948 --> 01:08:27.904
How about I eat and you read?

01:08:28.831 --> 01:08:32.279
No? Not so good? Okay, fine.

01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:50.196
All right, Varner, where are you?

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:30.622
SECURITY

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:44.660
Fungus Bob didn't just
have one kill buddy.

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:46.841
He had two.

01:09:46.876 --> 01:09:50.917
One more, and they could buy group
health insurance or form a rock band.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.407
Officer Eckles is checking
that right now.

01:09:54.377 --> 01:09:56.252
I don't know what this
Odd Thomas character knows...

01:09:56.287 --> 01:09:57.936
but I know that Robertson
is stupid and careless...

01:09:57.971 --> 01:09:59.586
and he's gonna get us nailed
if we don't do something.

01:09:59.621 --> 01:10:00.467
Relax.

01:10:00.502 --> 01:10:03.835
Did Robertson ever find those
photos at the mall he misplaced?

01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:08.328
I said, relax.
I'll take care of him.

01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:22.284
Stalking someone at the mall, Bern?

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.579
Robertson, that idiot.

01:10:27.087 --> 01:10:28.962
We got to make it
look like an accident.

01:10:28.997 --> 01:10:31.102
Oh, it'll look like
an accident all right.

01:10:31.137 --> 01:10:33.207
When I find Robertson,
I'm gonna kill him.

01:10:33.546 --> 01:10:35.702
Already been there, done that.

01:10:41.546 --> 01:10:44.879
Looks like their plan was to jump
out at the end of the mall disaster

01:10:44.914 --> 01:10:47.499
like heroes responding to the call.

01:10:48.338 --> 01:10:52.166
But I never saw any bodachs
around Eckles, either.

01:10:52.505 --> 01:10:56.501
The presence of the bodachs
tipped me off to Fungus Bob...

01:10:56.536 --> 01:11:00.498
but not to his two co-conspirators,
which now seems...

01:11:00.838 --> 01:11:02.346
intentional.

01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:06.540
As if the bodachs knew of my gift,
as if they know I can see them.

01:11:07.922 --> 01:11:10.494
The bodachs have been
manipulating me.

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.046
I'm gonna finish you off,
old man.

01:11:38.633 --> 01:11:39.847
Four.

01:11:39.882 --> 01:11:42.169
Well, that's just jiffy.

01:12:13.551 --> 01:12:16.667
This just so happens
to be my very favorite book.

01:12:17.301 --> 01:12:19.458
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.

01:12:19.676 --> 01:12:25.010
Officer Varner Prince of Darkness,
Officer Varner, Prince of Darkness.

01:12:35.094 --> 01:12:36.255
Viola.

01:12:36.469 --> 01:12:38.594
- Viola! What are you doing here?
- Odd! Geez!

01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:40.684
- You scared the-
- What are you doing here?

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:42.656
We had to pick out
a birthday present for Levanna.

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.142
And Nicolina wanted to get
a card for her big sister.

01:12:45.177 --> 01:12:47.593
Look, your dream, it's happening
right here, right now.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.990
I thought in a big stadium or
at the water park or a bowling alley.

01:12:51.025 --> 01:12:53.761
Ladies, I need you to take Viola
and get her out of here, okay?

01:12:53.796 --> 01:12:56.464
Come on.
Come on, come on. Go on.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.561
This made Dorothy so very angry...

01:12:59.596 --> 01:13:01.887
that she picked up the bucket
of water that stood near...

01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:04.590
and dashed it all over
the wicked witch.

01:13:05.512 --> 01:13:08.006
And then the wicked witch said...

01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:10.502
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

01:13:13.346 --> 01:13:15.917
There's suddenly lots
of flashing lights.

01:13:16.263 --> 01:13:18.833
With old-fashioned kiddie music.

01:13:21.055 --> 01:13:23.010
And then I hear a big crowd.

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:28.630
And then there's the sound of water,
gushing water.

01:13:32.097 --> 01:13:33.758
Bye, Nell.

01:13:33.793 --> 01:13:35.421
Bye, Stormy.

01:13:37.722 --> 01:13:39.597
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry!

01:13:39.632 --> 01:13:41.138
Move, move. Excuse me!

01:14:29.475 --> 01:14:32.177
A gun! He's got a gun!

01:15:25.228 --> 01:15:28.759
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

01:15:29.603 --> 01:15:33.549
Gypsy Mummy gave us a card that
said so, for a single quarter...

01:15:34.187 --> 01:15:36.675
what other couples couldn't
buy at any price.

01:15:40.728 --> 01:15:42.388
No!

01:16:06.272 --> 01:16:08.760
Get out of the way! Get off!

01:17:11.567 --> 01:17:13.024
Hi.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.728
Odd!

01:17:33.359 --> 01:17:34.687
Odd!

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.728
It's not over.

01:17:44.194 --> 01:17:45.520
It's not over.

01:17:46.152 --> 01:17:48.771
It's not over. It's not over.

01:17:51.694 --> 01:17:54.069
Hey Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

01:17:54.104 --> 01:17:56.355
His names Kevin Goss.

01:17:56.778 --> 01:17:58.653
One of these days, bang!

01:17:58.688 --> 01:17:59.814
You hear me?

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.485
He's got a gun!

01:18:39.405 --> 01:18:41.037
- Is this your truck?
- I need a drill!

01:18:41.072 --> 01:18:42.884
Do you have a drill?
I need to get this open!

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:44.662
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop. Now look!

01:18:44.697 --> 01:18:46.780
You see that woman?
Some maniacs just shot up the mall!

01:18:46.815 --> 01:18:49.072
So either get with me,
get behind me, or get out!

01:18:49.107 --> 01:18:50.648
I got a grinder!

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.812
Oh, my God.

01:19:20.866 --> 01:19:23.782
Everyone get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out!

01:19:23.817 --> 01:19:24.896
Now!

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:13.231
Hey!

01:20:34.286 --> 01:20:35.530
Shit!

01:20:45.245 --> 01:20:47.947
You really set yourself up, asshole!

01:21:27.122 --> 01:21:29.825
It's cold in the desert.

01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:19.416
I could tell my stuffing
wasn't entirely intact.

01:22:19.451 --> 01:22:21.340
He's awake. He's awake!

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:24.207
But it was nothing
they couldn't stitch back together.

01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:33.793
Karla told me that the chief
had come through just fine...

01:22:33.828 --> 01:22:36.466
and somehow managed
to spin Fungus Bob's corpse...

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:40.115
into a bizarre cover story
that kept my secret a secret.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.300
An FBI expert
on television said that

01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:50.251
if you hadn't gotten
those explosives out of there,

01:22:50.286 --> 01:22:53.133
at least 500 or 600 people
would've died, for sure.

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:57.114
They told me events at the Green Moon
Mall had made headlines everywhere.

01:22:58.168 --> 01:23:00.658
But I didn't want to read
or see anything about it.

01:23:02.335 --> 01:23:03.217
According to Eckles...

01:23:03.252 --> 01:23:06.440
he and Varner started a satanic
cult when they were teenagers.

01:23:06.475 --> 01:23:09.628
One night, they killed a man
and realized they enjoyed it.

01:23:09.663 --> 01:23:10.927
So they kept at it,

01:23:10.962 --> 01:23:13.876
eventually joining
the police force for better cover.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.103
They met Robertson and Goss
and came up with a plan...

01:23:18.138 --> 01:23:21.287
to infiltrate a small town
and then slowly kill it.

01:23:32.754 --> 01:23:34.177
Odd! Odd! Odd!

01:23:34.212 --> 01:23:36.701
Detail, present arms.

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:38.427
ODD SAVES

01:23:38.462 --> 01:23:39.629
MARRY ME ODD!
ODD WORLD

01:23:39.664 --> 01:23:41.786
IN ODD WE TRUST

01:24:02.547 --> 01:24:03.554
When I'm with you,

01:24:03.589 --> 01:24:07.334
I don't have to worry about
pancakes or poltergeists.

01:24:08.381 --> 01:24:11.711
When I'm with you,
I'm with my destiny.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:16.162
Where you live, I flourish.

01:24:21.173 --> 01:24:23.662
We ate food that wasn't healthy.

01:24:26.382 --> 01:24:28.871
We drank too much...

01:24:30.549 --> 01:24:32.207
and slept too much...

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:41.507
but could never kiss enough.

01:24:42.216 --> 01:24:45.048
Everything was just as I wished.

01:24:49.508 --> 01:24:53.668
- Yeah?
- Odd, it's us. Open up.

01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:57.592
- Hey, guys.
- We have been calling you, Oddie.

01:24:57.627 --> 01:24:59.891
I know. You know,
I disconnected the phone...

01:24:59.925 --> 01:25:02.217
because the reporters won't
leave me and Stormy alone.

01:25:02.252 --> 01:25:04.006
- Son.
- Do you want some-

01:25:06.509 --> 01:25:08.797
You've been here long enough.

01:25:08.832 --> 01:25:11.084
We think it's time to stop.

01:25:11.593 --> 01:25:16.499
Sweetheart, the coroner finally
released her poor body.

01:25:33.885 --> 01:25:35.675
A part of me knew...

01:25:36.302 --> 01:25:39.834
from the moment I saw her
behind the ice cream counter.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:43.385
But the truth hurt
too much to accept.

01:25:44.511 --> 01:25:47.842
Her death would have been
one wound too many that day.

01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:52.543
And I think I would have
let go of this life.

01:26:04.429 --> 01:26:06.384
She's here, isn't she?

01:26:13.596 --> 01:26:15.254
You got to let her go.

01:26:16.513 --> 01:26:19.427
She deserves to move
to her next life.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.006
Son...

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:25.554
it's just time.

01:27:22.141 --> 01:27:23.599
I love you.

01:27:26.183 --> 01:27:30.343
I promise I will see you again.
Okay?

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:43.575
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING PICO MUNDO
COME BACK AGAIN SOON

01:28:50.563 --> 01:28:53.605
Stormy always believed that life
is not about how fast you run...

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.760
or with what degree of grace.

01:28:56.313 --> 01:28:58.361
That this life is a boot camp,

01:28:58.396 --> 01:29:00.936
that we must persevere
through all the obstacles

01:29:00.971 --> 01:29:03.478
and hardships to earn our way
into the next life.

01:29:04.522 --> 01:29:07.768
To be with her again, I will have
the perseverance of a bulldog.

01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:12.347
But sometimes, it seems to me...

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:16.306
the training
is unnecessarily painful.

01:29:23.606 --> 01:29:25.654
If I live an average life-span...

01:29:25.689 --> 01:29:29.020
I'll have another 60 years
before I see Stormy again.

01:29:29.523 --> 01:29:31.313
That will be a long wait.

01:29:33.398 --> 01:29:35.354
But I am a patient man.

01:29:37.773 --> 01:29:40.060
And I have much to do.
