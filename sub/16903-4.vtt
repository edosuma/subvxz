WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:03.000
- so we're agreed.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.160
Assuming nothing goes wrong
in the next eight hours,

00:06.160 --> 00:08.720
<i>jayden michael tyler will be
the next tgs cast member.</i>

00:08.720 --> 00:11.080
- eight cities,
40 comics,

00:11.080 --> 00:13.640
One slap fight with
a tsa agent.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.120
I'm done.
jayden's the one.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.320
[sighs]

00:16.320 --> 00:18.160
Now we just have to make
jack think

00:18.160 --> 00:21.040
That hiring jayden
was his decision.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.360
Who are the decoys we will
be using for the audition?

00:24.360 --> 00:27.400
- uh, middle-aged female comic
with a bolo tie,

00:27.400 --> 00:30.120
One-man band who only plays
halloween music,

00:30.120 --> 00:33.160
And australia's
jackie mason.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.520
Jack will hate all of them
and pick jayden.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.360
- ugh, i hate doing this
to people.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.840
They all think this is
their big break,

00:38.840 --> 00:40.040
But we're just using them.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.520
- call it the hornberger
system.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.160
- you've never been on
the other side of this, pete.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.960
Auditioning is hard.
so much rejection.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.520
Elizabeth lemon,

00:47.520 --> 00:51.520
I am represented by
suzanne's b-plus talent.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.440
My carpets need a deep clean.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.960
- next!

00:54.960 --> 00:57.080
- and then you call your mom
and tell her, "it went great,"

00:57.080 --> 00:59.120
And you've got a really good
feeling about this year.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.400
- i know it's no fun,

01:00.400 --> 01:02.920
But you are making
this guy's dreams come true.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.760
At your age,
it's probably the last time

01:04.760 --> 01:05.840
You'll ever make a man happy.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.400
- [laughs]
that's true, liz is old.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.600
Uh, where are we
on this audition?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.840
- uh, we've narrowed it down
to four people

01:12.840 --> 01:14.000
For this afternoon.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.440
- i'm already not liking
some of these people.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.440
It reminds me
of being on the bus.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.320
- come on, guys,
these are people up here

01:19.320 --> 01:21.720
With feelings and mothers
who worry about them.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.880
- lemon, stop right there.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.080
You are on top of
the pyramid.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.240
<i>tgs is a small pyramid,
which nevertheless</i>

01:27.240 --> 01:28.600
Will one day be your tomb.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.440
You can't let emotions
distract you

01:30.440 --> 01:32.160
From making decisions
about the slaves

01:32.160 --> 01:33.640
Who built the pyramid,
which, again,

01:33.640 --> 01:34.920
Will one day be your tomb.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.640
- geez.
sorry i'm not a robot.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.040
- we all are.
but we're getting there.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.000
In ten years, this'll all be
the size of a microchip.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.520
But until then,
you're in charge.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.440
Think like a robot.
be logical and dispassionate.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.000
- are you okay?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.120
- see, that's exactly what i'm
talking about--human empathy.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.760
It's as useless as
the winter olympics.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.440
This february on nbc.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.160 --> 02:17.560
- tracy.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.200
I just heard they're
closing down the set today.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.400
Do you think
it's for auditions?

02:20.400 --> 02:23.160
- jennifer m,
why are you so worked up?

02:23.160 --> 02:25.120
- because it's gonna be
a disaster.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.720
Like katrina.
do you remember katrina?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.280
That crazy girl
from hair and make-up?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.080
- nothing's gonna change.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.160
They're gonna hire
some skinny white guy.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.080
How is that a threat?

02:34.080 --> 02:35.560
You'll do your lady
characters,

02:35.560 --> 02:37.120
And i will get onstage
and people will laugh

02:37.120 --> 02:40.200
Even when i forget my,
um, my--line.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.680
- lines.
- lines.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.120
- everybody's a threat,
tracy.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.480
You don't know who's gonna
walk through that door.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.680
- it's true.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.920
Anything can happen
in the audition process.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.160
- oh, yeah,
i forgot, dotcom.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.920
You know everything about acting
because you played a bird

02:51.920 --> 02:53.760
In some stupid school play.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.720
[laughs mockingly]

02:55.720 --> 02:56.960
- yes, tracy.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.600
<i>i was trigorin in
the seagull</i>

02:58.600 --> 03:01.800
On the wesleyan artspace
mainstage.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.680
- he will know.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.400
- vampyr!

03:05.400 --> 03:07.720
- are they closing the stage
this afternoon for auditions?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.160
What's on that piece of paper?

03:09.160 --> 03:12.000
- uh, miss lemon did say,
"keep this away from jenna."

03:12.000 --> 03:13.160
But she may have meant
the jenna

03:13.160 --> 03:16.760
That works downstairs
at that luggage store...

03:16.760 --> 03:27.280
So i'm gonna give it to you.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.680
- thank you, kenneth.
- oh, my, sir.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.880
It looks like you got a bad case
of the chewdaddies.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.800
Ozark kisses?
the woodsman's companion?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.640
Bedbugs. they're a big problem
in new york right now.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.000
- i don't have bedbugs,
kenneth, i went to princeton.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
- sir, anyone can get them.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.400
Back in stone mountain,
even the mayor had bedbugs.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.440
And she was a horse.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.840
[knocking on door]
- i'm sorry.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.160
Am i interrupting?

03:52.160 --> 03:53.800
- uh--uh, no, breckman,
it's nothing.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.280
- it's not nothing, sir.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.640
Mr. donaghy's got
blue ridge quilt ticklers.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.240
Oh, sorry. bedbugs.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.840
- bedbugs?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.560
Can't those live in
your clothes?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.120
- that's true, mr. donaghy.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.320
The mayor had to burn
all her pantsuits.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.480
- don't worry about it,
breckman.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.800
I'll see you at the, uh,

04:09.800 --> 04:11.160
Business development meeting
at 11:00.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.880
- you know what, uh,
we may not need you for that.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.120
So i'm gonna go now.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.959
[knocking on door]

04:18.959 --> 04:20.000
- hey, what's up, dotcom?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.080
- the great uta hagen
once said...

04:23.080 --> 04:27.920
<i>"is why i'd like to audition
for tgs."</i>

04:27.920 --> 04:30.120
Walter, you idiot.
you lost a card.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.200
- wait, you wanna audition?

04:32.200 --> 04:35.320
- oh, dotcom,
i think you're great.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.640
But no, i'm sorry,
you can't.

04:37.640 --> 04:42.360
- i thank you for treating
my requests with respect.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.080
- liz,
i need to speak with you.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.440
- beat it,
grizz or dotcom.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.080
I saw your audition list.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.640
- what?
now, i told kenneth to--

04:50.640 --> 04:52.040
Luggage store jenna.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.040
- what are our options
besides jayden michael tyler?

04:54.040 --> 04:57.160
- a lot of good people.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.200
- you're setting him up
to get it.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.560
What, you don't think
i know that trick?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.960
You don't think
i've been brought in

05:00.960 --> 05:02.160
On a million auditions
just to make kim cattrall

05:02.160 --> 05:03.360
Seem grounded and human?

05:03.360 --> 05:06.000
- yes, fine, we're stacking
the deck for jayden.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.600
Let me guess what
your problem is with him.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.240
He's a talented actor
and you're threatened by that.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.800
- no, i know him, liz.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.760
We did a play together
20 years ago,

05:13.760 --> 05:15.240
And we were best friends.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.200
Until he betrayed me.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.040
- hey, jenna, congratulations
on your nomination.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.200
For worst supporting bra!

05:21.200 --> 05:22.920
[laughter]

05:22.920 --> 05:24.520
- what play is that?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.760
- i will not allow this
to happen.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.080
- ugh.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.120
This process is painful enough
without adding your crazy to it.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.240
- too late.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.960
I'm getting that hot feeling
in my head.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.720
- [sighs]

05:35.720 --> 05:39.120
- hey, mom, it's walter.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.360
I'm just calling to tell you
they cancelled the audition,

05:41.360 --> 05:43.760
So maybe pray
on something else.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.760
- you can audition.
- i'll need a piano.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.805
- [sighs]

05:56.458 --> 05:57.778
- what is this?

05:57.778 --> 05:59.338
- it's cisco equipment, sir.

05:59.338 --> 06:01.338
It's almost better than
being there.

06:01.338 --> 06:03.218
- is this because of
my bedbugs?

06:03.218 --> 06:05.018
I will not be ostracized
like this.

06:05.018 --> 06:07.258
- jack, bedbugs have become
an epidemic in new york.

06:07.258 --> 06:11.058
I just think that everyone
would feel more comfortable

06:11.058 --> 06:12.258
If you stayed
in your office.

06:12.258 --> 06:14.658
You like
the cisco equipment?

06:14.658 --> 06:16.298
- of course, it continues
to be the gold standard

06:16.298 --> 06:18.418
By which all business technology
is judged.

06:18.418 --> 06:21.058
Cisco, the human network.

06:21.058 --> 06:22.258
- this is what happens

06:22.258 --> 06:23.818
When you live north
of 62nd street.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.018
- you think i didn't
hear that?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.338
I can hear your hair growing
on this thing.

06:27.338 --> 06:28.498
You are discriminating
against me.

06:28.498 --> 06:31.098
I am a human being.

06:31.098 --> 06:32.378
Did you just mute me?

06:32.378 --> 06:34.698
Did you just use cisco's
cutting edge

06:34.698 --> 06:36.258
Suremute technology
to mute me?

06:36.258 --> 06:38.138
- because we've got to have
a united front.

06:38.138 --> 06:40.338
Bart said that if we go in there
with the numbers all set--

06:40.338 --> 06:42.338
- i'm gonna come to your house
and crawl into your bed

06:42.338 --> 06:44.258
And i'm gonna bite you
on the ass, do you hear me?

06:44.258 --> 06:45.938
- what do you mean,
dotcom's auditioning?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.098
How dumb are you?
is there anything in there?

06:48.098 --> 06:49.218
- pete, stop it.

06:49.218 --> 06:50.658
You know my fontanelle
never closed.

06:50.658 --> 06:54.258
I tried to be strong,
but i just couldn't tell him no.

06:54.258 --> 06:55.778
And now i don't have to,
see,

06:55.778 --> 06:57.418
Because we're making it
jack's decision.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.818
- oh, we were,

06:58.818 --> 07:00.738
But now you've compromised
the hornberger system.

07:00.738 --> 07:02.418
It's four people for a reason.

07:02.418 --> 07:03.618
The first guy jack's
settling in,

07:03.618 --> 07:06.178
The second he hates,
the third is jayden,

07:06.178 --> 07:08.378
The fourth proves
how good jayden is.

07:08.378 --> 07:10.378
The more people you add,
the less effective it is.

07:10.378 --> 07:12.098
Like a neighborhood dad
garage band.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.738
- come on, it's just dotcom.

07:13.738 --> 07:16.898
- it won't be, because
this is what you're doing.

07:16.898 --> 07:18.338
- i'm driving a bus?

07:18.338 --> 07:21.218
- no, you're--
you're opening the floodgates.

07:21.218 --> 07:22.538
- with a horizontal wheel?

07:22.538 --> 07:24.218
- floodgate wheels
are horizontal!

07:24.218 --> 07:25.618
It was all under control.

07:25.618 --> 07:29.298
Now everyone's gonna want in
and we can't stop them.

07:29.298 --> 07:30.618
- hey, what the frak, nerds?

07:30.618 --> 07:33.298
Pete told me you were only
looking at outside people.

07:33.298 --> 07:35.338
Now dotcom's auditioning?

07:35.338 --> 07:37.258
- frank, i know
you're a stand-up, but--

07:37.258 --> 07:38.778
- no "but."
i want in.

07:38.778 --> 07:41.618
And i'm not changing my act
to fit your stupid show.

07:41.618 --> 07:44.218
- mm-hmm.

07:44.218 --> 07:46.538
- liz, there you are.

07:46.538 --> 07:48.378
- i heard about this whole
dotcom thing.

07:48.378 --> 07:50.738
I'm not saying
i want to audition,

07:50.738 --> 07:54.538
But nicky motorulo
from scotch plains, new jersey

07:54.538 --> 07:55.738
Might be interested.

07:55.738 --> 07:58.498
'ey, fuhgeddaboutit.

07:58.498 --> 08:02.298
- actor emergency!

08:02.298 --> 08:03.298
- where?

08:03.298 --> 08:04.298
- here.

08:04.298 --> 08:07.138
Pete and liz wanna hire
this guy jayden.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.218
He's evil, tracy.

08:08.218 --> 08:10.418
- he's evil tracy?

08:10.418 --> 08:13.498
Oh, he's evil "comma" tracy.

08:13.498 --> 08:15.058
Go on.

08:15.058 --> 08:17.698
- pete and liz are rigging it
to make sure he gets the job.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.218
Do you know who else
they're auditioning?

08:19.218 --> 08:21.018
A one-man band.

08:21.018 --> 08:23.138
Some old australian,
dotcom.

08:23.138 --> 08:25.418
- dotcom?
oh, no.

08:25.418 --> 08:27.498
<i>i once saw that guy
become trigorin</i>

08:27.498 --> 08:29.178
At the wesleyan artspace.

08:29.178 --> 08:31.378
That guy is good.
i can't compete with him.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.618
- okay.

08:32.618 --> 08:35.178
Then we have to make sure
neither one of them gets the job

08:35.178 --> 08:36.977
By finding better actors
ourselves.

08:36.977 --> 08:50.818
- good idea. let's go.

08:50.818 --> 08:53.218
- call my car, i need to go
to the dermatologist.

08:53.218 --> 08:54.298
- i'm sorry, sir.

08:54.298 --> 08:57.498
But until you get
this bedbug situation fixed,

08:57.498 --> 08:59.138
They don't want you using
your company car.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.458
In fact, they suggested
you take...

09:02.458 --> 09:07.618
A taxicab!

09:07.618 --> 09:08.818
- hey.

09:08.818 --> 09:10.458
Why are you scratching?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.338
You have mugabe's concubines.

09:12.338 --> 09:27.658
No, bedbugs!

09:27.658 --> 09:29.298
- good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

09:29.298 --> 09:31.178
I'm sorry you bother you,
my name is jack.

09:31.178 --> 09:34.338
And i have bedbugs.

09:34.338 --> 09:38.098
I'm not a drug addict.

09:38.098 --> 09:40.138
I am an executive with
the general electric corporation

09:40.138 --> 09:43.618
And i just need to get
my medicine.

09:43.618 --> 09:46.098
If someone could tell me
how to transfer to the 4 train,

09:46.098 --> 09:48.498
I would be very grateful
to you for your help.

09:48.498 --> 09:55.298
God bless you,
and have a good day.

09:55.298 --> 10:04.778
[chattering,
instruments tuning]

10:04.778 --> 10:06.178
- happy?

10:06.178 --> 10:08.058
- no, not since i was a child.

10:08.058 --> 10:09.738
What is kathy geiss doing here?

10:09.738 --> 10:11.738
- her father heard about
brian williams

10:11.738 --> 10:13.298
And insisted she get a chance.

10:13.298 --> 10:17.018
There's too many people here
for the hornberger system, liz.

10:17.018 --> 10:19.098
What if jack actually picks
one of these weirdos?

10:19.098 --> 10:20.498
Do you know the australian
jackie mason

10:20.498 --> 10:22.658
Was chemically castrated
by his government?

10:22.658 --> 10:24.418
- [sighs]
- liz. pete.

10:24.418 --> 10:26.538
- jayden. you made it.

10:26.538 --> 10:29.578
- so this is my competition,
huh?

10:29.578 --> 10:30.778
- [growls]

10:30.778 --> 10:33.298
- no! bad!

10:33.298 --> 10:35.138
Sorry.
it's a little crazy here today.

10:35.138 --> 10:37.178
- are you kidding?
i'm just happy to be here.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.178
This is corny, but will you
take a picture of me

10:40.178 --> 10:41.378
<i>in front of the tgs sign?</i>

10:41.378 --> 10:44.338
- yes, of course.

10:44.338 --> 10:45.858
[chuckles]
- thanks.

10:45.858 --> 10:47.458
Maybe this will convince
my mom

10:47.458 --> 10:49.498
To stop sending me
law school applications.

10:49.498 --> 10:50.658
[liz and pete laugh]

10:50.658 --> 10:52.258
- my mom used to send me
articles about

10:52.258 --> 10:55.378
How older virgins are considered
good luck in mexico.

10:55.378 --> 10:57.458
- okay, well,
i'll see you onstage.

10:57.458 --> 11:01.458
I can't believe
this is happening.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.418
- okay, this may be
a train wreck,

11:03.418 --> 11:05.538
But that is the body
that we need to pull out of it.

11:05.538 --> 11:06.778
- all right.

11:06.778 --> 11:08.618
I'll rethink the system
and try to make it work.

11:08.618 --> 11:17.378
- hey, at least we know
it can't get any worse.

11:17.378 --> 11:20.138
- if you are a funny gay man,
please get into the car.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.458
- i repeat, all funny gays
into the car.

11:23.458 --> 11:27.058
- i'm not gay.
i'm bi-larious!

11:27.058 --> 11:31.738
[laughter]

11:31.738 --> 11:34.378
[tires screech]

11:34.378 --> 11:35.978
- black people,

11:35.978 --> 11:37.818
I know i've said some terrible
things about you in print.

11:37.818 --> 11:40.378
But i come here today
on a mission of peace.

11:40.378 --> 11:43.138
- we need the funniest fool here
to step forward.

11:43.138 --> 11:45.338
- kolandra! kolandra!

11:45.338 --> 11:47.338
Kolandra! kolandra!

11:47.338 --> 11:49.498
Kolandra! kolandra!

11:49.498 --> 11:55.058
- that'll work.

11:55.058 --> 11:56.818
- good luck on your audition.
you're gonna get it.

11:56.818 --> 11:58.458
- don't jinx me.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.458
- walter,
you're going to get it.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.858
I made you something.

12:01.858 --> 12:13.058
- it's a seagull.

12:13.058 --> 12:14.618
- oh, mr. donaghy.

12:14.618 --> 12:16.218
Did they make you ride
the freight elevator?

12:16.218 --> 12:18.058
- i walked in your shoes today,
kenneth.

12:18.058 --> 12:19.258
- i don't think you did, sir.

12:19.258 --> 12:22.298
I've just got the one pair,
and i sleep in them.

12:22.298 --> 12:24.538
- i fell to the bottom of
the pyramid today.

12:24.538 --> 12:26.538
Cast out of society
like a leper.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.058
No one will look at me,
let alone touch me.

12:28.058 --> 12:29.658
But you will, won't you?

12:29.658 --> 12:31.458
Make me feel human again.

12:31.458 --> 12:35.898
Embrace me, kenneth.

12:35.898 --> 12:37.978
- i've got a thing.

12:37.978 --> 12:49.778
<i>- et tu, kenneth?</i>

12:49.778 --> 12:51.378
- it's just a math equation,
that's all.

12:51.378 --> 12:53.978
Just, okay--you put two women
in a row like--

12:53.978 --> 12:55.378
Who the hell are they?

12:55.378 --> 12:57.298
- these are some actors
we found

12:57.298 --> 12:59.378
Driving all over
this amazing vibrant city.

12:59.378 --> 13:02.058
- and this is
a reimbursement form for my gas.

13:02.058 --> 13:04.351
I drove a million miles.

13:09.804 --> 13:11.084
- look.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.644
I don't know how you dragged
this idiot in

13:12.644 --> 13:13.644
On your paranoia--

13:13.644 --> 13:15.044
- paranoia? where?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.164
- ugh!

13:16.164 --> 13:18.244
You are not taking away
the one good thing

13:18.244 --> 13:20.644
That i get out of
this miserable process.

13:20.644 --> 13:22.844
- if you're talking about
hiring jayden, you're insane.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.524
Just call anyone
he's ever worked with.

13:24.524 --> 13:25.644
- i did.

13:25.644 --> 13:27.484
I called every one
of his references,

13:27.484 --> 13:28.684
And they are impressive.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.924
A commercial with
martin scorsese,

13:30.924 --> 13:33.484
An off-broadway play
with christopher walken.

13:33.484 --> 13:36.004
He's even studying
the meisner technique

13:36.004 --> 13:37.604
With sir gilbert gottfried.

13:37.604 --> 13:40.364
And they all said
the same thing.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.204
Scorsese: all right, let me
tell you one thing about jayden.

13:42.204 --> 13:45.684
I love jayden.

13:45.684 --> 13:48.444
Walken: i love jayden.

13:48.444 --> 13:50.444
Gottfried: i love jayden!

13:50.444 --> 13:52.604
- was describing
your sandwich necessary

13:52.604 --> 13:54.484
To our understanding
of what happened?

13:54.484 --> 13:57.444
- none of your actors
are auditioning.

13:57.444 --> 13:58.884
The hornberger system
will prevail.

13:58.884 --> 14:00.244
- think again, liz.

14:00.244 --> 14:01.644
The hornberger system
will de-vail.

14:01.644 --> 14:03.444
Is that the opposite
of prevail?

14:03.444 --> 14:06.764
- [sighs]

14:06.764 --> 14:09.124
- i hoped it wouldn't
come to this.

14:09.124 --> 14:11.524
But now i have to ruin jayden
psychologically.

14:11.524 --> 14:12.884
- tell me more.

14:12.884 --> 14:14.084
- i'm gonna walk up to him

14:14.084 --> 14:15.364
And say the four
most vicious words

14:15.364 --> 14:17.084
You can say to a person
you've already met.

14:17.084 --> 14:18.924
"nice to meet you."

14:18.924 --> 14:21.684
- and that freaks people out,
huh?

14:21.684 --> 14:26.364
This is a learning
and friendship adventure.

14:26.364 --> 14:27.964
- lemon, are you ready
to get started?

14:27.964 --> 14:29.324
- yes, i just need one minute

14:29.324 --> 14:31.004
To send some of
these people home.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.364
- really?

14:32.364 --> 14:33.804
You're just going to kick
all of them to the curb

14:33.804 --> 14:35.284
Like so much human garbage?

14:35.284 --> 14:38.124
Why are you being so cold
and dispassionate?

14:38.124 --> 14:40.164
- what?
because you told me to.

14:40.164 --> 14:41.644
- and you just blindly do
whatever i say?

14:41.644 --> 14:42.844
What are you, a robot?

14:42.844 --> 14:45.644
- you also told me
to be a robot.

14:45.644 --> 14:46.644
What is going on with you?

14:46.644 --> 14:48.644
- i have bedbugs.

14:48.644 --> 14:50.684
And these bedbugs have chewed
the blinders off my eyes.

14:50.684 --> 14:53.044
These are all people, lemon.
with feelings.

14:53.044 --> 14:54.484
- grr!

14:54.484 --> 14:56.524
- and they all get a chance.
they all get to audition.

14:56.524 --> 15:01.044
Anyone who wants to audition,
just give your name to pete.

15:01.044 --> 15:03.404
- anthony decicco.

15:03.404 --> 15:07.644
I'll need an obama wig.

15:07.644 --> 15:10.564
Frank rossitano.
queens, new york.

15:10.564 --> 15:14.084
I guess dreams
can come true.

15:14.084 --> 15:16.404
So last weekend,
i was at the mall,

15:16.404 --> 15:18.484
But then i went
to the beach [bleep]

15:18.484 --> 15:19.724
With my niece's friend

15:19.724 --> 15:22.924
And then i [bleep] at
the pool party.

15:22.924 --> 15:25.524
- mm-hmm.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.724
Mm.

15:27.724 --> 15:30.204
- for my first character,
i'd like to do an old janitor

15:30.204 --> 15:36.084
Who's finally had enough
and stabs everybody!

15:36.084 --> 15:37.964
- hello, i'm jenna maroney.

15:37.964 --> 15:39.324
- oh, hi, i'm jayden,
nice to meet you.

15:39.324 --> 15:42.044
- how dare you pretend
you don't remember me!

15:42.044 --> 15:43.604
I'm the one who doesn't
remember you!

15:43.604 --> 15:47.924
<i>- josh gerard.
former tgs cast member.</i>

15:47.924 --> 15:50.644
Then some movie work.
that didn't pan out.

15:50.644 --> 15:53.244
Then my agent dropped me.
then a web short.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.404
Where they made me
do guy-guy stuff.

15:56.404 --> 15:59.364
Oh, god, forgive me!

15:59.364 --> 16:01.004
I call this character
smelly belly.

16:01.004 --> 16:04.524
- good evening, we are
laugh of the mohicans.

16:04.524 --> 16:06.324
Our first bit is
the hamburglar--

16:06.324 --> 16:07.724
- no!

16:07.724 --> 16:09.844
- toofer and lutz didn't tell me
they were gonna go together.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.724
This throws off
the whole system.

16:11.724 --> 16:15.044
I gotta find one more.

16:15.044 --> 16:20.444
- hey, dotcom.
nice to meet you.

16:20.444 --> 16:21.684
- why would he
say that to me?

16:21.684 --> 16:23.484
- have you ever wondered
what happens

16:23.484 --> 16:25.644
In the refrigerator
after the light goes off?

16:25.644 --> 16:26.804
Does the milk say,

16:26.804 --> 16:28.004
"let's go down to
the crisper drawer

16:28.004 --> 16:29.204
And make trouble"?

16:29.204 --> 16:34.524
I don't know.
fuhgeddaboutit.

16:34.524 --> 16:37.604
- you wanna be on a tv show?

16:37.604 --> 16:39.604
Come on.

16:39.604 --> 16:41.724
Come on, come on.

16:41.724 --> 16:44.644
- growing up in bed-stuy,
there was a certain music

16:44.644 --> 16:46.644
To the way people talked.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.204
"hey, papi

16:48.204 --> 16:49.604
Whatchoo doin'?"

16:49.604 --> 16:52.644
I'm sorry,
can i start over?

16:52.644 --> 16:55.924
Someone really messed with
my head right before i came on.

16:55.924 --> 16:58.164
- i dreamed that love

16:58.164 --> 17:02.684
Would never die

17:02.684 --> 17:04.003
I dreamed that god

17:04.003 --> 17:07.124
Would be forgiving

17:07.124 --> 17:14.364
- [mechanical sounds]

17:14.364 --> 17:17.644
- okay. here we go.
you can do it.

17:17.644 --> 17:18.844
- hi, i'm jayden michael tyler.

17:18.844 --> 17:20.604
My first piece will be
a dinner party

17:20.604 --> 17:22.604
At martin scorsese's house
with christopher walken

17:22.604 --> 17:24.564
And gilbert gottfried.
- what?

17:24.564 --> 17:27.284
- [as christopher walken]
thank you for inviting us,

17:27.284 --> 17:29.324
Martin.

17:29.324 --> 17:30.524
- [as gilbert gottfried]
i brought wine!

17:30.524 --> 17:34.004
- [wheezing laughter]
- son of a bitch.

17:34.004 --> 17:37.484
I was talking to you
on the phone, wasn't i?

17:37.484 --> 17:38.684
- what?

17:38.684 --> 17:40.804
- [poorly impersonating walken]
give...it up.

17:40.804 --> 17:43.644
I figured out...
your game.

17:43.644 --> 17:45.924
- congratulations.

17:45.924 --> 17:48.484
Your show is so stupid,
i thought you would be too.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.644
- i can't believe i went through
all of this for you.

17:50.644 --> 17:51.764
I fought for you, jayden,

17:51.764 --> 17:53.644
And now i'm gonna have
to start all over.

17:53.644 --> 17:54.644
- no, you don't.

17:54.644 --> 17:57.004
You're giving me the job
no matter what.

17:57.004 --> 17:59.884
Because your fingerprints
are all over my camera.

17:59.884 --> 18:01.164
- so?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.604
- so?

18:02.604 --> 18:04.484
You said you'd only hire me

18:04.484 --> 18:06.604
If i let you take pictures
of my genitals.

18:06.604 --> 18:08.524
- oh, no!

18:08.524 --> 18:09.964
What is wrong with them?

18:09.964 --> 18:13.644
Jenna was right.
you're totally crazy.

18:13.644 --> 18:16.604
- would a crazy person
laugh like this?

18:16.604 --> 18:21.004
[maniacal laughter]

18:21.004 --> 18:26.644
- [mechanical sounds]

18:26.644 --> 18:28.964
- you can use the regular
elevators around the corner.

18:28.964 --> 18:30.844
You're the one
who's human here.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.244
- [despondent intonation]

18:32.244 --> 18:34.004
- well said.

18:34.004 --> 18:36.244
- jenna, you're right.
he's crazy.

18:36.244 --> 18:37.444
We can't hire him.

18:37.444 --> 18:39.524
- who, brian williams?
- no, jayden.

18:39.524 --> 18:41.564
I'm sorry i doubted you.

18:41.564 --> 18:42.764
It's just that you've
never been right before.

18:42.764 --> 18:44.684
About anything.

18:44.684 --> 18:46.924
- i know.

18:46.924 --> 18:48.644
- i gotta find jack.

18:48.644 --> 18:50.524
Tell him we didn't find anyone
and we have to start over.

18:50.524 --> 18:57.044
- my two cents?
i liked the janitor.

18:57.044 --> 18:59.884
- i'd never been to
an audition before.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.124
It was upsetting.

19:01.124 --> 19:03.764
A grotesque carnival
of human misery.

19:03.764 --> 19:05.444
- to be fair,
i did not think kathy geiss

19:05.444 --> 19:07.564
Was gonna finish her song
by taking off her underpants.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.564
- however, the process
was a pleasant reminder

19:09.564 --> 19:12.284
That some of us are,
in fact, better than others.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.564
There was one clear standout
in my opinion.

19:14.564 --> 19:15.764
- no, i know.

19:15.764 --> 19:17.124
He was my favorite too,
but we can't.

19:17.124 --> 19:19.644
He's crazy.
we have to start over.

19:19.644 --> 19:21.124
- all actors
are crazy, lemon,

19:21.124 --> 19:23.164
And the more talented they are,
the crazier they are.

19:23.164 --> 19:24.484
I mean,
look at jenna and tracy.

19:24.484 --> 19:26.564
They handed in
a check request form

19:26.564 --> 19:30.684
For $600,000 worth of gas.

19:30.684 --> 19:32.644
Your job is to manage the crazy
and bring out the talent.

19:32.644 --> 19:35.564
- crazy is one thing,
he's a psychopath.

19:35.564 --> 19:36.644
- you're wrong.
he's a good person.

19:36.644 --> 19:38.084
And this conversation is over.

19:38.084 --> 19:40.484
We're hiring the robot.

19:40.484 --> 19:44.404
- the robot...
is the guy that you like.

19:44.404 --> 19:48.484
And you think he's the best...
because?

19:48.484 --> 19:50.004
- because he was
the only one of them,

19:50.004 --> 19:52.524
The only person in new york
that would shake the hand

19:52.524 --> 19:54.084
Of a man with bedbugs.

19:54.084 --> 19:56.684
Lemon, we're not just hiring
an actor.

19:56.684 --> 19:59.484
We're hiring a coworker,
a human being,

19:59.484 --> 20:00.644
And i say we hire the one

20:00.644 --> 20:03.204
Who lives by the code
of the robot.

20:03.204 --> 20:07.524
Care. love. live.

20:07.524 --> 20:09.244
- okay.

20:09.244 --> 20:12.004
So instead of starting
from scratch,

20:12.004 --> 20:14.004
We are hiring the robot.

20:14.004 --> 20:21.484
On the show.
to act.

20:21.484 --> 20:24.644
Boy, i hope
he speaks english.

20:24.644 --> 20:27.206
Yikes.

20:29.079 --> 20:30.399
- this little light of mine,
lord

20:30.399 --> 20:32.159
All: i'm gonna let it shine

20:32.159 --> 20:35.639
Whoa, this little light
of mine, lord

20:35.639 --> 20:38.119
I'm gonna let it shine

20:38.119 --> 20:40.599
This little light
of mine, lord

20:40.599 --> 20:42.519
I'm gonna let it shine

20:42.519 --> 20:45.119
Every day, every day

20:45.119 --> 20:48.279
Let it shine

20:48.279 --> 20:50.919
Every day, every day

20:50.919 --> 20:52.279
I'm gonna let it shine

20:52.279 --> 20:55.839
Oh, every day, every day

20:55.839 --> 20:58.199
I'm gonna let it shine

20:58.199 --> 21:00.679
Every day, every day

21:00.679 --> 21:02.719
I'm gonna let it shine

21:02.719 --> 21:05.319
Every day, every day

21:05.319 --> 21:09.839
Let it shine

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
